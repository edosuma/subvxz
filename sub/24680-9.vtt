The following story is
fictional and does not depict
any actual person or event

00:07.441 --> 00:09.989
In New York City's war on crime,

00:09.989 --> 00:13.025
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:13.025 --> 00:14.874
of the Major Case Squad.

00:14.874 --> 00:17.367
These are their stories.

00:18.653 --> 00:21.598
What did you think?
I wasn't gonna find out, Russell?

00:21.598 --> 00:24.380
You are such a heartless bastard!

00:24.380 --> 00:27.769
Paula! Let go.

00:30.478 --> 00:33.286
If you show up with one
of your whores tonight, Russell,

00:33.286 --> 00:36.453
I swear to God you'll regret it!

00:37.744 --> 00:40.552
What's the matter, Jason?
You're not hungry?

00:40.552 --> 00:41.944
He's been throwing up.

00:41.944 --> 00:44.731
I think he's nervous about
singing at the recital tonight.

00:44.731 --> 00:47.159
God gave you a beautiful gift.

00:47.159 --> 00:48.661
And he'll give you the courage to use it.

00:48.661 --> 00:50.708
Stupid son of a bitch.!

00:50.708 --> 00:53.303
All I did is try and find out when
he was coming to the recital tonight,

00:53.303 --> 00:56.246
and he practically ran me over.

00:57.185 --> 01:01.183
You children, go get ready for school.

01:02.740 --> 01:04.419
If your father tries to talk to you tonight,

01:04.419 --> 01:07.396
make sure you get me or Helen, okay?

01:09.502 --> 01:12.547
We'll be there at 6:45, okay?

01:12.547 --> 01:14.310
Okay, we'll see you then.

01:14.310 --> 01:15.805
Oh, my poor brother.

01:15.805 --> 01:19.173
Paula had some kind of screaming fit
in front of his office this morning.

01:19.173 --> 01:21.244
About tonight, Brenda,
I'm gonna be late.

01:21.244 --> 01:23.248
I have to wait for some test results.

01:23.248 --> 01:27.024
- Okay. I'll see you soon.
- Okay, bye.

01:28.682 --> 01:30.771
How's Jason?
Is he feeling better?

01:30.771 --> 01:33.033
He's still in the bathroom throwing up.

01:33.033 --> 01:34.468
Maybe I should go back.

01:34.468 --> 01:37.631
Sam says he will be fine.
I'm sure he will.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.654
Has my future ex arrived?

01:39.654 --> 01:42.476
No.
But his sister's here.

01:45.031 --> 01:47.463
Hey. Did you see Russell out there?

01:47.463 --> 01:50.077
No. He hasn't shown up?

01:50.077 --> 01:51.632
I should call him.

01:51.632 --> 01:54.326
Sam said Jason's been sick all day.

01:58.085 --> 02:01.446
Here comes trouble.

02:01.446 --> 02:04.062
You're late.

02:04.062 --> 02:05.741
There was a thing on the subway.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.803
to make this evening special.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2003/11/23

03:56.547 --> 03:58.328
Mr. Connors's housekeeper found him.

03:58.328 --> 04:01.085
Time of death was sometime last night.

04:01.085 --> 04:03.561
Kids live here?
All of this sports equipment...

04:03.561 --> 04:06.193
Connors's wife moved out
with the kids last winter.

04:06.193 --> 04:08.828
Anyway, looks like he interrupted a burglary.

04:08.828 --> 04:10.691
Haven't found the point of entry yet.

04:10.691 --> 04:11.886
Who has the keys?

04:11.886 --> 04:13.278
Just the housekeeper.

04:13.278 --> 04:15.459
Connors changed the locks after
the separation with kids

04:15.459 --> 04:17.446
you can only get from the manufacturer.

04:17.446 --> 04:19.962
Anything in particular worth stealing?

04:19.962 --> 04:21.781
A stamp collection up in the study.

04:21.781 --> 04:23.908
Tried to break into the cabinet.

04:23.908 --> 04:27.785
Connors's attorney over there
gave us that inventory of the collection.

04:30.115 --> 04:33.321
The lawyer talked to Connors just after 6:30.

04:33.321 --> 04:35.712
He was running late for his kids' recital.

04:35.712 --> 04:38.961
The burglar probably didn't
expect him to be home.

04:40.559 --> 04:44.233
The towel is damp.

04:44.233 --> 04:50.696
Connors had probably just taken a shower...

04:50.696 --> 04:55.591
and then got attacked right about here.

04:55.591 --> 04:56.987
He staggered over here.

04:56.987 --> 05:01.147
He put his hand down on here
just long enough to-to bleed on it.

05:01.147 --> 05:03.631
But he didn't run, you know.
He didn't defend himself.

05:03.631 --> 05:06.286
He could've used these statues,

05:06.286 --> 05:08.614
but he didn't.

05:09.416 --> 05:13.479
He went down... here.

05:13.479 --> 05:17.296
He got hit again and again.

05:17.296 --> 05:18.792
Left for dead.

05:18.792 --> 05:23.106
Connors must've come to,
tried to get to the phone.

05:28.331 --> 05:33.783
There's a bruise here.
It's curved...

05:33.783 --> 05:36.947
like a field hockey stick.

05:36.947 --> 05:38.359
It's got a curved head.

05:38.359 --> 05:40.576
There could've been one with
the sports equipment downstairs.

05:40.576 --> 05:44.562
- Yeah. / - The killer grabs it on his way up
to break into the stamp cabinet.

05:49.275 --> 05:50.960
Blood.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.616
Maybe from the murder weapon.

05:52.616 --> 05:55.864
He killed Connors first,
then broke into the cabinet.

05:55.864 --> 05:58.460
Yeah, but he didn't get at the stamps.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.734
Ran out of time?

06:01.734 --> 06:03.495
Maybe he had to get somewhere.

06:03.495 --> 06:06.167
Somewhere like a recital.

06:06.167 --> 06:10.535
Russell wanted to bring a vocal coach
from Juilliard to hear Jason sing.

06:10.535 --> 06:13.890
He was so proud of him and Sam.

06:13.890 --> 06:16.651
Paula thought he was bringing a date,
and she went ballistic.

06:16.651 --> 06:19.511
What, she was, uh, jealous?

06:19.511 --> 06:23.310
- She has a boyfriend.
- Yeah. Eddie Malloy, the felon.

06:23.310 --> 06:24.774
Felon?

06:24.774 --> 06:27.260
- Was he at the recital?
- Yes.

06:27.260 --> 06:30.536
With Paula and Helen, the nanny.

06:30.536 --> 06:31.951
Not to point any fingers,

06:31.951 --> 06:36.108
but Malloy got there just as
the concert was starting.

06:37.802 --> 06:39.778
Yeah. That-That's good to know.

06:39.778 --> 06:42.524
Thank you, Dr. Friedman.
We'll be in touch.

06:46.749 --> 06:48.812
The recital hall's three blocks away.
We need a search team...

06:48.812 --> 06:52.619
Dumpsters, trash cans.
Okay? Thanks.

Saturday, October 4

06:55.133 --> 06:58.928
I told Russell to keep those stamps
in a safe deposit box.

06:58.928 --> 07:01.076
He was just inviting trouble.

07:01.076 --> 07:02.431
From anyone in particular?

07:02.431 --> 07:05.311
I can just imagine the kinds
of women he had in that bedroom.

07:05.311 --> 07:08.555
Who was at the recital with you last night?

07:08.555 --> 07:12.435
Our nanny.
And my friend, Mr. Malloy.

07:12.435 --> 07:14.846
- Mr. Malloy was late.
- He was delayed at work.

07:14.846 --> 07:16.628
He called to tell you?

07:16.628 --> 07:20.906
There's no reception in that recital hall.
It's like a tomb.

07:20.906 --> 07:24.090
Why this fixation with Eddie?
Did Russell's posse put you up to it?

07:24.090 --> 07:27.317
They said that Eddie was
a painting contractor.

07:27.317 --> 07:29.151
What else did they say about Eddie?

07:29.151 --> 07:35.572
Oh. He...
was a paroled felon...

07:35.572 --> 07:37.797
who served a year for possession of stolen...

07:37.797 --> 07:41.143
I told you.
Eddie was with me all evening.

07:41.143 --> 07:44.752
What you said was he was late,
and you weren't sure...

07:44.752 --> 07:46.538
That's not true.
I called him at his job.

07:46.538 --> 07:48.297
His partner said he was on his way.

07:48.297 --> 07:50.382
And then he arrived. It's no mystery.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.773
Well, the mystery is that, uh,

07:52.773 --> 07:56.333
the reception in the recital hall,
it cleared up.

07:56.333 --> 07:59.256
Because a moment ago,
you said it was like a tomb.

08:02.420 --> 08:03.928
My sons'll be home for lunch soon.

08:03.928 --> 08:08.131
It would be so nice if you weren't here.

08:11.481 --> 08:14.744
First she alibis Malloy.
Then she blows his alibi.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.054
She doesn't seem stupid.

08:17.054 --> 08:19.366
Oh, uh, she isn't.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.369
She's-She's cutting him loose.

08:23.649 --> 08:25.957
They were in a Dumpster off 65th.

08:25.957 --> 08:27.821
Uh, blood belongs to the victim.

08:27.821 --> 08:29.580
No fingerprints on the hockey stick.

08:29.580 --> 08:31.401
Shirt's chambray, size large.

08:31.401 --> 08:33.547
Well, that fits Eddie Malloy.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.330
Fits me too.

08:35.330 --> 08:39.307
Yeah, but you're not dating
a widow with $40 million.

08:39.307 --> 08:41.068
There's no perspiration.

08:41.068 --> 08:45.442
There would be if the killer exerted himself.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.136
This greenish stain,
you have any idea what it is?

08:48.136 --> 08:51.305
We haven't analyzed it yet,
but it looks like some kind of tarnish.

08:51.305 --> 08:52.871
Well, I'm gonna need to have blowups of this.

08:52.871 --> 08:56.674
- Do you have any?
- Yeah.

08:56.674 --> 08:59.198
I don't mess with collectibles.
Check my rap sheet.

08:59.198 --> 09:00.762
Strictly TVs and toasters.

09:00.762 --> 09:02.542
But you knew about
the Connors's stamp collection?

09:02.542 --> 09:06.067
I know they keep money in banks,
but I don't break in and take it.

09:06.067 --> 09:09.427
Well, that's admirable.
You were late to the recital.

09:09.427 --> 09:11.989
I was working.
I forgot the time.

09:11.989 --> 09:15.209
Your arthritis bother you when you paint?

09:15.209 --> 09:19.854
'Cause I was noticing your copper bracelet.

09:19.854 --> 09:22.493
- Does it work for you?
- Yeah. Seems to.

09:22.493 --> 09:25.272
I was thinkin' of gettin' a bracelet.

09:25.272 --> 09:30.354
Yeah, but I hear that
they tarnish and stain your shirt.

09:30.354 --> 09:33.220
- You get that?
- I never looked.

09:33.220 --> 09:34.456
Well, let's look at it now.

09:34.456 --> 09:35.930
Hey.

09:35.930 --> 09:39.340
Huh. Yeah. There's a green stain.

09:40.041 --> 09:43.168
Hey, you know,
this reminds me of another shirt.

09:43.168 --> 09:44.997
Yeah.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.522
Same stain.

09:48.522 --> 09:50.870
This shirt has a lot of other stains on it too.

09:50.870 --> 09:53.610
Red ones.

09:56.105 --> 10:00.848
Russell Connors's blood...
on your shirt.

10:00.848 --> 10:03.401
No way.
I didn't do this.

10:03.401 --> 10:05.166
I was working late.
You ask your partner.

10:05.166 --> 10:06.663
You said Paula called them.

10:06.663 --> 10:08.463
She said she called after she said

10:08.463 --> 10:11.871
there was no phone
reception in the recital hall.

10:11.871 --> 10:15.868
She pooched your alibi.

10:15.868 --> 10:18.954
Okay, look.

10:18.954 --> 10:21.751
Paula cannot know this.

10:23.686 --> 10:27.156
I was with another girl, okay?

10:27.156 --> 10:29.188
That's why I was late.

10:29.188 --> 10:33.410
And if Paula knew,
that would end your hopes...

10:33.410 --> 10:38.103
for marrying her and...
and getting half of-of Connors's money.

10:38.103 --> 10:42.284
No, wait. Uh, he's dead,
so she gets all his money.

10:42.284 --> 10:43.985
I did not kill him.

10:43.985 --> 10:46.903
Just don't tell Paula about this girl.

10:46.903 --> 10:49.709
She goes nuts over this stuff.

10:55.174 --> 10:59.325
Mommy!
Mommy!

11:04.425 --> 11:06.366
He was having another nightmare.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.535
It was the same dream.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.042
But it was just a dream.

11:11.042 --> 11:13.413
And now you're awake, see?

11:15.255 --> 11:19.174
Everything scary has gone away.

11:19.174 --> 11:21.955
You go back to sleep now.

11:23.486 --> 11:27.856
I'll stay here until he drops off.

11:33.526 --> 11:37.413
Sam is very lucky to have a brother like you.

Fiesta Wigs Calore 429 West 17th Street
Tuesday, October 7

11:40.083 --> 11:41.759
Eddie was here, okay?

11:41.759 --> 11:44.110
I closed early so we could be alone.

11:44.110 --> 11:45.607
He used the phone here to call his partner

11:45.607 --> 11:48.687
in case Mrs. Moneybags was looking for him.

11:50.815 --> 11:55.166
Is-Is that a new phone jack?
You-You've had work done?

11:56.235 --> 11:58.461
Yeah. I had the phone company out here.

11:58.461 --> 12:00.158
They said I have low voltage.

12:00.158 --> 12:03.221
Now would that be eight volts or 12 volts?

12:03.221 --> 12:06.612
Eight volts.
That's what the guy said.

12:06.612 --> 12:09.594
Excuse me.

12:11.373 --> 12:14.255
The power was being drained by a phone tap.

12:14.255 --> 12:17.888
Paula.
She knew that Eddie was cheating.

12:17.888 --> 12:19.180
She set him up.

12:19.180 --> 12:21.488
She killed two rats with one trap.

12:21.488 --> 12:23.860
A dream come true.

12:25.110 --> 12:27.502
We traced a fingerprint on the wig store's switch box

12:27.502 --> 12:29.153
to a private investigator.

12:29.153 --> 12:31.352
Paula Connors hired him to follow Malloy.

12:31.352 --> 12:33.312
She found out Eddie was cheating,
so she made it look like

12:33.312 --> 12:34.863
he killed her husband? That's rich.

12:34.863 --> 12:37.746
She wore one of his shirts over
her own when she killed Connors.

12:37.746 --> 12:39.460
It's why there was no sweat on it.

12:39.460 --> 12:42.420
Backtrack a bit. We think she
went to Connors's house,

12:42.420 --> 12:44.159
rang the doorbell, and he just let her in?

12:44.159 --> 12:47.470
Maybe he thought she came to apologize.

12:47.470 --> 12:49.401
Does she strike you as the apologetic type?

12:49.401 --> 12:51.509
I don't think Connors would be fooled.

12:51.509 --> 12:53.060
You don't seem convinced she did it.

12:53.060 --> 12:55.291
I'm trying to imagine how she did it.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.294
She didn't break in, she didn't have a key.

12:57.294 --> 12:59.016
- I really...
- Nail down the basics.

12:59.016 --> 13:01.573
Check her alibi.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.032
I have something on the stove.

13:09.032 --> 13:11.220
I don't know when Mrs. Connors will be home.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.153
This is a beautiful piano.
Is it Mrs. Connors?

13:13.153 --> 13:14.990
No.
It's her youngest son, Sam's.

13:14.990 --> 13:17.377
He accompanies his brother when he sings.

13:17.377 --> 13:19.810
They get their talent from Mrs. Connors?

13:19.810 --> 13:22.383
Sam and Jason were adopted.

13:22.383 --> 13:23.950
Mr. And Mrs. Connors...
brought them back

13:23.950 --> 13:27.233
from an orphanage in Romania
when they were small.

13:27.233 --> 13:30.276
Yeah. L-I hope it's not burning.

13:31.707 --> 13:33.524
The Connors must've loved
each other very much

13:33.524 --> 13:35.934
to make that kind of commitment together.

13:35.934 --> 13:38.853
Yes, they did love each other.

13:38.853 --> 13:43.343
But after the children came,
the missus got so focused on them,

13:43.343 --> 13:46.590
and Mr. Connors got so busy at work.

13:46.590 --> 13:48.390
And now she has Mr. Malloy.

13:48.390 --> 13:50.863
I'm sure that he's very devoted.

13:50.863 --> 13:53.110
Did they arrive at the recital together?

13:53.110 --> 13:56.924
No. She came alone.
He arrived later.

13:56.924 --> 14:00.230
I thought you and Mrs. Connors
went to the recital hall together?

14:00.230 --> 14:02.763
No. She was on the phone with her attorney.

14:02.763 --> 14:04.685
So I went ahead with the children.

14:04.685 --> 14:06.219
Jason wasn't feeling well.

14:06.219 --> 14:07.917
His stomach...

14:07.917 --> 14:10.489
He was in that bathroom up
until the time he performed.

14:10.489 --> 14:12.373
You were backstage with him?

14:12.373 --> 14:13.928
Yes, I was there.

14:13.928 --> 14:15.832
Why didn't you give him some of this?

14:15.832 --> 14:17.924
Ginger. Ginger snacks*,
ginger tea, ginger candy.

14:17.924 --> 14:20.218
That's the missus.
She likes it for her digestion.

14:20.218 --> 14:24.417
So when did Mrs. Connors get to the recital?

14:24.417 --> 14:26.256
A few minutes after I did.

14:26.256 --> 14:29.320
No. L-I thought you said that
you were backstage.

14:31.629 --> 14:33.636
Helen, you-you can't have it both ways.

14:33.636 --> 14:36.187
Either you were with Mrs. Connors,

14:36.187 --> 14:39.145
or you were with the kids.

14:39.145 --> 14:42.366
I guess I'm not sure when
the missus arrived. I'm sorry.

14:42.366 --> 14:45.966
Yeah, by the way, is there an extra key
for Mr. Connors's house?

14:45.966 --> 14:47.217
Because we forgot ours.

14:47.217 --> 14:51.390
No.
Mr. Connors never gave out keys.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.876
Secure Key Company
330 West 14th Street
Wednesday, October 8

14:53.876 --> 14:55.736
A woman called two days ago.

14:55.736 --> 14:57.123
Said she found a set ofkeys,

14:57.123 --> 15:00.329
and she gave me a serial number
that corresponded to Mr. Connors's keys.

15:00.329 --> 15:01.792
But your keys don't have serial numbers.

15:01.792 --> 15:03.607
No.
What she had was the I.D. Tag

15:03.607 --> 15:06.090
that we send with new keys, uh, like this one.

15:06.090 --> 15:08.128
So what did she want to know?

15:08.128 --> 15:11.010
Who the keys belonged to
so she could return 'em.

15:11.010 --> 15:13.655
But you don't give
that kind of information out.

15:13.655 --> 15:16.762
Boy, was she mad.
But finally, she very politely asked me

15:16.762 --> 15:19.504
if the keys belonged to
an address on East 67 th.

15:19.504 --> 15:21.315
Since she asked nice, I said yes.

15:21.315 --> 15:22.655
Do you have her name?

15:22.655 --> 15:27.949
No, but our system has caller I.D.

15:29.823 --> 15:32.148
Paula's cell phone.

15:35.004 --> 15:36.878
The keys from Paula's office.

15:36.878 --> 15:39.747
No I.D. Tags.
None of them match Russell's key.

15:39.747 --> 15:43.595
Paula's wearing shoes
two sizes larger than she used to.

15:43.595 --> 15:47.119
Uh, same with her clothes.
She's got all her old dresses pushed back.

15:47.119 --> 15:50.384
New clothes are...

15:50.384 --> 15:53.394
three sizes bigger,
all blouses, slacks.

15:53.394 --> 15:57.205
Maybe the reason is in here.

15:57.205 --> 15:58.953
Oh, it's locked.

15:58.953 --> 16:02.346
Probably doesn't want her kids
seeing what she's been bingeing on.

16:02.346 --> 16:04.670
Still haven't been able to find that key.

16:06.258 --> 16:08.521
More ginger.

16:10.169 --> 16:11.367
Tea.

16:11.367 --> 16:13.362
Oh, here it is.

16:13.362 --> 16:19.057
One place her kids would be
too embarrassed to look.

16:19.057 --> 16:22.466
Well, well. Quite a drugstore.

16:22.466 --> 16:25.565
She stripped the labels off,
but this could be, uh,

16:25.565 --> 16:29.413
lidocaine, uppers.

16:30.876 --> 16:34.729
We'll take samples,
then, uh, lock it back up.

16:35.782 --> 16:38.991
Jason's backhand is really coming along.

16:40.371 --> 16:42.855
It's all right.
It's just routine police business.

16:42.855 --> 16:44.901
- Right, Detective?
- Right.

16:44.901 --> 16:46.752
Your mother's just helping us
with the investigation.

16:46.752 --> 16:49.794
Can I speak to you for a moment upstairs?

16:51.402 --> 16:56.145
I wanted to ask you about a phone call
you made to the, uh, Secure Key Company.

16:56.145 --> 16:59.248
Caller I.D. Said it came from your-your cell phone.

16:59.248 --> 17:03.160
It was two days ago.
You-You gave them a serial number?

17:03.160 --> 17:06.681
Oh, yes. A tag fell out of Eddie's
pants when I was folding them.

17:06.681 --> 17:09.498
I wanted to know if it belonged to a woman.

17:09.498 --> 17:11.171
But they didn't tell you, did they?

17:11.171 --> 17:13.576
No. So I threw it out.

17:15.573 --> 17:17.976
- You okay, Mrs. Connors?
- I'm just tired.

17:17.976 --> 17:21.202
I haven't been sleeping well.

17:22.622 --> 17:26.257
Well, um, thanks for your help.

17:27.865 --> 17:29.717
It's prednisone.

17:29.717 --> 17:33.169
And the syrup is probably, uh, prelone.

17:34.060 --> 17:37.333
She's taking steroids.
That's why she's put on weight.

17:37.333 --> 17:40.161
And the ginger,
that's probably for the nausea.

17:40.161 --> 17:42.115
So she's sick?

17:42.880 --> 17:45.051
Yes. Could be cancer.

17:45.051 --> 17:46.558
She's been on drugs for a while.

17:46.558 --> 17:50.465
Maybe a-a maintenance program.

17:52.129 --> 17:53.677
The fact the fridge is locked,

17:53.677 --> 17:56.359
the nanny didn't know
what the ginger tea was for...

17:56.359 --> 17:58.375
Paula hasn't told anyone.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.882
Maybe because there's no cure.

18:03.084 --> 18:04.771
Any medical bills over there?

18:04.771 --> 18:06.582
Uh...

18:09.235 --> 18:11.580
Here.

18:13.123 --> 18:18.430
This is a bill from an allergist
for her son, Jason.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.923
Russell was killed with
five whacks from a hockey stick.

18:21.923 --> 18:25.264
Paula'd barely be able to manage one.

18:25.264 --> 18:29.823
A dry cleaning receipt for items
picked up two days after the murder.

18:29.823 --> 18:32.615
They probably don't give next-day
service for bloodstained clothes.

18:32.615 --> 18:37.505
This total includes a prepaid amount for
clothes that were brought in for cleaning...

18:37.505 --> 18:40.132
the same day that this order was picked up.

18:44.402 --> 18:48.448
Prepaid in the hopes that we wouldn't notice...

18:48.448 --> 18:51.325
that they had clothes cleaned...

18:51.325 --> 18:55.008
two days after the murder.

18:55.008 --> 18:58.714
I didn't like those policemen snooping
around the children's room.

18:58.714 --> 19:01.347
Yes. They made quite a mess of things.

19:01.347 --> 19:04.369
They didn't take anything besides
the papers from my office, did they?

19:04.369 --> 19:07.328
No. I would have told you.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.650
Let's hope we've see the last of them.

19:13.953 --> 19:17.503
- Here's that order.
- Thanks.

19:21.196 --> 19:25.139
I'm not finding any bloodstains.

19:25.139 --> 19:28.938
These look like the nanny's uniform.

19:28.938 --> 19:31.407
Mothballs.

19:31.407 --> 19:35.306
The signature scent of a resale shop.

19:35.306 --> 19:39.557
You'd think Paula could
afford new uniforms for Helen.

19:39.557 --> 19:44.205
But if Helen wanted to replace
something without Paula noticing,

19:44.205 --> 19:47.182
she'd buy them used.

19:47.182 --> 19:51.025
Helen could've dropped the kids off
at the recital and gone to Russell's.

19:51.025 --> 19:53.592
What would she get out of killing Russell?

19:53.592 --> 19:57.962
Paula's dying. Russell's dead.

19:58.813 --> 20:02.889
The kids. Custody.

20:02.889 --> 20:05.259
County Clerk's Office 60 Centre Street
Friday, October 10

20:05.259 --> 20:07.940
I didn't find a will or a trust agreement on file.

20:07.940 --> 20:11.278
But when I ran the name
Helen Reynolds through the system,

20:11.278 --> 20:17.312
I did find there was a request for
a death certificate six months ago.

20:17.312 --> 20:21.309
All right. Dylan Reynolds.
Died 1989, age seven.

20:21.309 --> 20:24.439
Helen had a child.

20:25.755 --> 20:31.110
This certificate was requested by
a trust officer at Paula's bank.

20:31.110 --> 20:34.386
They'd need it if Helen was being
made guardian of Paula's kids.

20:34.386 --> 20:37.082
She'd only get custody
if Russell's out of the way.

20:37.082 --> 20:41.130
Then she'd get the kids and the 40 million.

20:41.130 --> 20:43.797
To a woman who's lost a child,

20:43.797 --> 20:47.265
the money would be secondary.

20:50.572 --> 20:54.213
Yes, my son and my husband
were killed by a drunk driver.

20:54.213 --> 20:56.219
And Mrs. Connors's bank needed proof of this?

20:56.219 --> 21:00.652
Yes. It's a legal requirement to make
me the guardian of the children.

21:00.652 --> 21:02.331
If anything happens to Mrs. Connors,

21:02.331 --> 21:08.199
it was her wish that life for
Sam and Jason go on just as it is.

21:08.199 --> 21:10.447
Well, you're-you're the obvious choice, right?

21:10.447 --> 21:13.521
I mean, you have a mother's
devotion to the kids. Huh?

21:13.521 --> 21:16.747
And you're, um, uh...
Well, you're fit.

21:16.747 --> 21:19.163
I'll bet you have a-a devastating
tennis serve, huh?

21:19.163 --> 21:22.318
I'll bet you really just, you know,
clobber that ball.

21:23.835 --> 21:25.672
The children keep me active.

21:25.672 --> 21:28.880
Something else has us confused.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.703
The cleaners said you brought these in...

21:31.703 --> 21:34.806
two days after Mr. Connors was murdered.

21:34.806 --> 21:37.269
And it looks to us like you bought
these at a resale shop

21:37.269 --> 21:39.868
and replaced them for another outfit.

21:39.868 --> 21:41.667
Maybe one that you threw away.

21:41.667 --> 21:43.479
See, that's the trouble with blood.

21:43.479 --> 21:45.903
When it sets, you can't get rid of it.

21:45.903 --> 21:47.806
Blood?

21:47.806 --> 21:50.884
- You think I killed Mr. Connors?
- Well, it makes sense.

21:50.884 --> 21:53.277
A mother haunted by
the death of her own child.

21:53.277 --> 21:55.692
Those children would become your children.

21:55.692 --> 21:58.571
Those children have a mother.

22:00.168 --> 22:02.319
For now.

22:02.319 --> 22:04.995
But Mrs. Connors hasn't been in the pink lately.

22:04.995 --> 22:07.472
It's anemia.
She just has anemia.

22:07.472 --> 22:10.423
- She told you that?
- No. Dr. Friedman did.

22:10.423 --> 22:12.654
Mr. Connors's brother-in-law?

22:12.654 --> 22:15.092
When?

22:15.092 --> 22:16.206
Two weekends ago,

22:16.206 --> 22:19.647
I picked up the kids from
Mr. Connors's house, and he was there.

22:19.647 --> 22:21.724
He asked me about Mrs. Connors's health,

22:21.724 --> 22:24.011
her fatigue, what she ate.

22:24.011 --> 22:27.623
He told me then it sounds just like anemia.

22:28.406 --> 22:30.084
There's nothing wrong with me.
I'm just...

22:30.084 --> 22:32.276
Well, I'm missing a few hormones.

22:32.276 --> 22:34.485
Well, that might account for your mood swings,

22:34.485 --> 22:37.060
but not the nausea or...

22:37.060 --> 22:40.619
your difficulty in judging distances.

22:40.619 --> 22:43.291
You know, the staircase.
You had to concentrate

22:43.291 --> 22:45.301
that your foot landed on the step.

22:45.301 --> 22:47.133
I'm a little distracted.
You would be too...

22:47.133 --> 22:49.888
if your husband was murdered
and everyone thought you did it.

22:50.755 --> 22:53.659
- We don't think that anymore.
- Good.

22:53.659 --> 22:55.705
You don't have the strength.

22:55.705 --> 22:58.933
Not with all these drugs you're taking...

22:58.933 --> 23:02.810
prelone, prednisone.

23:05.223 --> 23:08.044
You have, uh, cancer?

23:08.044 --> 23:12.459
Maybe a deep cerebral tumor?

23:14.075 --> 23:16.079
Have you told anyone?

23:16.079 --> 23:18.434
No.

23:18.434 --> 23:21.221
I don't want anyone, um,
feeling sorry for me.

23:21.221 --> 23:23.044
I don't want to alarm my children.

23:23.044 --> 23:26.620
Do you anticipate anyone
challenging your nanny for custody?

23:26.620 --> 23:30.495
Maybe Mr. Connors's sister
or brother-in-law?

23:30.495 --> 23:32.991
The Friedmans?
They were Russell's choice, not mine.

23:32.991 --> 23:34.937
Dr. Friedman get along with Russell?

23:34.937 --> 23:36.738
Why this interest in Dr. Friedman?

23:36.738 --> 23:40.208
We believe he guessed that
Ms. Connors is terminally ill.

23:40.208 --> 23:41.806
You think he killed Russell?

23:41.806 --> 23:46.990
Well, he wouldn't do anything
without confirming your condition.

23:46.990 --> 23:52.071
With your permission, we'd like to check
if he accessed your medical records.

23:52.071 --> 23:56.107
Oh, yes. You most definitely
have my permission.

23:56.107 --> 23:58.370
Office of Dr.Ralph Friedman 551 First Avenue
Wednesday, October 15

23:58.370 --> 24:00.977
I didn't look at her records.
I'd lose my license.

24:00.977 --> 24:04.181
So it's a coincidence the oncology
department down the hall...

24:04.181 --> 24:07.208
asked Paula's insurance company
for a copy of her records?

24:07.208 --> 24:09.474
What does the oncology
department have to do with me?

24:09.474 --> 24:11.439
I'm an orthopedic surgeon.

24:11.439 --> 24:16.562
What was it that you said to the nanny?
That Paula had, uh, anemia?

24:17.894 --> 24:19.757
I was just making conversation.

24:19.757 --> 24:22.921
I don't know anything about her condition.

24:22.921 --> 24:26.690
Lucky for us, Dr. Friedman,
uh, you're a terrible liar.

24:27.777 --> 24:28.971
I'm not talking to you.

24:28.971 --> 24:31.403
He's not so good at covering his tracks either.

24:31.403 --> 24:35.019
The log shows he was researching
Paula's cancer three weeks ago.

24:35.019 --> 24:38.556
Here.
Central nervous system tumors.

24:38.556 --> 24:42.131
Yeah, look at the date.
It's two days before he asked

24:42.131 --> 24:45.134
the nanny... about Paula's health.

24:45.134 --> 24:48.219
And a week before he got her medical records.

24:48.219 --> 24:53.123
How'd he know to research her specific
cancer before seeing her records?

24:53.123 --> 24:55.964
Hand me that day planner.

24:58.256 --> 25:01.018
- Dr. Friedman?
- Hold on.

25:01.018 --> 25:05.019
Do you remember where you were
the afternoon of September 24...

25:05.019 --> 25:09.766
between, uh, I don't know,
like 3:00 and 4:00?

25:09.766 --> 25:12.095
Wednesday afternoon.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.227
I'm usually in surgery.

25:14.227 --> 25:18.382
Yes. Yes, that's right.
I was doing hand surgery. Why?

25:18.382 --> 25:22.484
Well, uh, someone was
on your computer at 3:15...

25:22.484 --> 25:26.785
downloading articles on central
nervous system tumors.

25:27.939 --> 25:30.938
Yeah, I ma... I made a mistake.

25:30.938 --> 25:33.473
The surgery was canceled.

25:33.473 --> 25:36.562
I was on the computer.

25:38.835 --> 25:42.182
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I was doing that research.

25:42.182 --> 25:45.778
And, uh, if you want to question me anymore,

25:45.778 --> 25:48.649
you can call my lawyer.
Okay?

25:49.757 --> 25:52.362
He had an alibi.
He didn't use it.

25:52.362 --> 25:55.912
That's because he was covering for
somebody using his computer.

25:57.368 --> 26:01.063
Um, Jason's allergist...

26:01.063 --> 26:03.845
What was his name?

26:03.845 --> 26:07.049
- Uh, Dr. Charters.
- Yeah.

26:07.049 --> 26:10.541
I wonder where he holds his clinic.

26:11.141 --> 26:15.937
Jason's allergist has a clinic in
Dr. Friedman's hospital every Wednesday.

26:15.937 --> 26:19.694
According to the staff,
afterwards Jason visits his Uncle Ralph.

26:19.694 --> 26:22.381
Apparently, they're great pals.

26:22.381 --> 26:25.986
The boy could've overheard
his mother talking about her illness.

26:25.986 --> 26:27.741
He'd be curious, like any kid.

26:27.741 --> 26:29.300
He might've talked to his uncle about it.

26:29.300 --> 26:31.757
Dr. Friedman probably showed him
how to look it up on the computer.

26:31.757 --> 26:36.552
And that's how Dr. Friedman
found out Mrs. Connors is terminally ill.

26:36.552 --> 26:38.768
The kid could've also told the nanny.

26:38.768 --> 26:41.058
If she knew her employer was dying,

26:41.058 --> 26:44.244
she'd make her move to get the kids.

26:44.964 --> 26:48.193
Didn't you tell me they were eliminating suspects?

26:48.193 --> 26:50.583
That's what I thought they were doing.

26:51.547 --> 26:54.551
Maybe we have.

26:56.458 --> 26:59.296
If they think Uncle Ralph killed Dad,

26:59.296 --> 27:02.400
what will happen to him?

27:02.400 --> 27:05.016
Well, if he's guilty,
he'll have to go to jail.

27:05.016 --> 27:06.797
But it won't be a bad place.

27:06.797 --> 27:08.169
We'll make sure of that.

27:08.169 --> 27:10.766
Well, how long would he have to stay there?

27:10.766 --> 27:13.148
Well, that'll depend. We'll make sure that

27:13.148 --> 27:15.580
Aunt Brenda gets a good lawyer for him.

27:15.580 --> 27:17.094
You know what I was thinking about?

27:17.094 --> 27:19.893
For Christmas this year,
we should all go back to Vail again.

27:19.893 --> 27:22.183
We had such a good time there.

27:22.183 --> 27:24.292
Maybe I'll even get out on the slopes this year.

27:24.292 --> 27:30.512
Can you imagine me on those
big skis slipping around?

27:34.978 --> 27:38.523
- Difficult piece.
- He makes it sound easy.

27:38.523 --> 27:43.761
After throwing up all day,
his throat muscles would be sore.

27:43.761 --> 27:49.738
You know, the vocal chords
raw from his stomach acids.

27:53.232 --> 27:58.275
See how he switches registers?
And-And...

27:58.275 --> 28:02.318
how he hits this series of high notes.

28:02.318 --> 28:05.994
His voice is perfect.

28:05.994 --> 28:08.776
He wasn't sick.

28:14.187 --> 28:17.883
Voice like an angel.

28:21.150 --> 28:24.546
Neither Mrs. Connors nor
the nanny could've been with Jason.

28:24.546 --> 28:26.241
We don't allow parents backstage.

28:26.241 --> 28:28.017
- But he was sick?
- Mm-hmm.

28:28.017 --> 28:29.331
You saw him?

28:29.331 --> 28:31.503
Well, no. He was in the bathroom.

28:31.503 --> 28:33.404
His brother, Sam, told me he was sick.

28:33.404 --> 28:35.514
Has Jason ever had stage fright before?

28:35.514 --> 28:37.729
- No, never.
- But this time you didn't question it.

28:37.729 --> 28:41.451
Why-Why is that?
Has he had other problems?

28:43.329 --> 28:48.348
A few weeks ago, we took a group
to Boston for a music competition.

28:48.348 --> 28:49.784
It was an overnight.

28:49.784 --> 28:53.215
The next morning,
we couldn't find Jason or Sam.

28:53.215 --> 28:55.510
- They ran away?
- No. After an hour,

28:55.510 --> 29:00.837
we found them asleep behind
some cushions in a closet.

29:00.837 --> 29:02.640
And they wouldn't say why they did it.

29:02.640 --> 29:06.437
I told Mrs. Connors.
She said they sometimes do this at home.

29:06.437 --> 29:09.441
Uh, can we see their desks?

29:14.010 --> 29:15.158
Thanks.

29:15.158 --> 29:20.676
I thought I was the only
14-year-old kid this tidy.

29:20.676 --> 29:23.595
Mmm, you still are.

29:23.595 --> 29:29.254
Jason keeps a clean desk,
except for this.

29:29.254 --> 29:31.649
That's a button that I lost two weeks ago.

29:31.649 --> 29:32.918
Where'd you lose it?

29:32.918 --> 29:34.191
In the music room.

29:34.191 --> 29:36.319
I heard it drop,
but I couldn't find it.

29:40.891 --> 29:43.404
School has a counselor?

29:43.404 --> 29:47.023
I'm not comfortable discussing
this without Mrs. Connors's permission.

29:47.023 --> 29:51.409
When abuse is suspected,
it's your duty to report it to the police.

29:53.802 --> 29:56.336
Sam told me he had bad dreams,

29:56.336 --> 29:59.017
but he wouldn't tell me what they were about.

29:59.017 --> 30:02.042
Jason won't discuss it at all.

30:02.042 --> 30:04.983
Anyway, I'd already vetted them for abuse.

30:04.983 --> 30:07.455
So at one time you did suspect abuse?

30:07.455 --> 30:09.706
Not physical.

30:09.706 --> 30:12.627
A few months ago,
Mr. Connors gave them each a cell phone,

30:12.627 --> 30:15.121
so they could call him whenever they wanted.

30:15.121 --> 30:17.554
A teacher found them in the trash.

30:17.554 --> 30:20.109
Sam told me they threw them away.

30:20.109 --> 30:24.783
He said Mr. Connors gave them
the phones so they'd get brain cancer.

30:24.783 --> 30:26.724
They thought he was trying to kill them?

30:26.724 --> 30:28.425
Apparently.

30:28.425 --> 30:31.477
When I asked them,
they admitted he never hurt them,

30:31.477 --> 30:33.520
never even raised his voice at them.

30:33.520 --> 30:36.383
Any other incidents in the last few weeks?

30:36.383 --> 30:38.385
Just one Friday.

30:38.385 --> 30:40.068
Mr. Connors came to pick them up.

30:40.068 --> 30:42.580
He was taking them to Bermuda for the weekend.

30:42.580 --> 30:44.646
But they wouldn't go with him.

30:44.646 --> 30:46.405
They were afraid.

30:46.405 --> 30:47.823
Terrified.

30:47.823 --> 30:49.972
Did you say anything to Mrs. Connors?

30:49.972 --> 30:53.137
Yes. She didn't seem concerned.

30:53.137 --> 30:56.916
Their file have the name of
the agency that handled their adoption?

30:56.916 --> 31:01.202
I think I received some records
from them a few years ago.

31:01.202 --> 31:04.014
Maybe not physical abuse.
Maybe psychological.

31:04.014 --> 31:06.953
And maybe not by their father.

31:06.953 --> 31:08.817
Criminal Courts Building
100 Centre Street
Monday, October 20

31:08.817 --> 31:11.679
Even if they were in fear for their lives,

31:11.679 --> 31:14.581
the murder was so cold-blooded and brutal...

31:14.581 --> 31:19.718
No, no. Look. Violence and brutality
aren't alien to these children.

31:19.718 --> 31:20.581
What's this?

31:20.581 --> 31:25.316
It's an account of their life
at the orphanage in Romania.

31:27.688 --> 31:29.857
I, uh, I see your point, Detective.

31:29.857 --> 31:33.146
But there's equally compelling
evidence against Mrs. Connors,

31:33.146 --> 31:37.092
the nanny and Dr. Friedman.
They all have motive, leaky alibis,

31:37.092 --> 31:40.074
and they've behaved in ways
that indicate a guilty mind.

31:40.074 --> 31:42.695
Maybe it indicates something else.

31:42.695 --> 31:44.857
Maybe we should have a family reunion.

31:44.857 --> 31:46.313
You think you can arrange one?

31:46.313 --> 31:48.725
Custody seems to be the issue on the table.

31:48.725 --> 31:50.506
I can probably get a hearing scheduled.

31:50.506 --> 31:52.409
What did you have in mind?

31:52.409 --> 31:56.230
Well, uh, Solomon threatened to split the child.

31:56.230 --> 32:00.862
This time, maybe we should let the child decide.

32:00.862 --> 32:06.288
We should go find a pair of gray flannel pants.

32:07.111 --> 32:09.284
Good morning.

32:09.284 --> 32:11.693
I'm Assistant District Attorney Ronald Carver,

32:11.693 --> 32:15.452
and I've just been told
Judge Palnick is stuck on the L.I.E.

32:15.452 --> 32:17.233
I'll say this now, Mr. Carver.

32:17.233 --> 32:21.847
This petition for new guardianship...
is completely outside your authority.

32:21.847 --> 32:24.484
The murder evidence points to all parties,

32:24.484 --> 32:26.876
and until I charge someone,

32:26.876 --> 32:30.492
I don't want any of you to have
custody of these children.

32:30.492 --> 32:34.434
Well, everyone in this room knows
who did it except, apparently, the police.

32:34.434 --> 32:36.154
What, you mean Eddie Malloy?

32:36.154 --> 32:38.609
You're-You're right.
He's a terrific suspect.

32:38.609 --> 32:41.633
Except he has an alibi.

32:41.633 --> 32:44.247
He was with his other girlfriend, Josie.

32:44.247 --> 32:45.907
You would take the word of that shop girl?

32:45.907 --> 32:48.241
We're taking the word...
of the manicurist next door

32:48.241 --> 32:51.449
who saw Eddie leave the wig shop.

32:51.449 --> 32:56.589
Such a great suspect.
You know, we have a better one.

32:58.860 --> 33:01.650
- Old Uncle Ralph.
- That's ludicrous.

33:01.650 --> 33:05.004
He knew that Paula was sick.

33:05.004 --> 33:07.081
We have proof.

33:07.081 --> 33:11.010
The research that you did
on your computer at the office.

33:11.010 --> 33:15.754
You knew what kind of cancer Paula
had two weeks before Russell was killed.

33:15.754 --> 33:21.911
Only Russell stood between you and the kids.

33:23.017 --> 33:24.559
Between you and the trust fund.

33:24.559 --> 33:26.237
- Ralph would never...
- Come on. You know...

33:26.237 --> 33:30.688
that you wanted Jason and Sam
at home with you, safe, in your happy home.

33:30.688 --> 33:33.424
Our home would be the best place for those poor children.

33:33.424 --> 33:36.612
Best place...

33:36.612 --> 33:40.092
for them?

33:40.092 --> 33:42.789
The best place for you?

33:44.060 --> 33:47.595
Come on, Doc.
You've got motive in spades.

33:47.595 --> 33:50.893
For God's sakes.

33:50.893 --> 33:53.068
I didn't kill him.

33:53.068 --> 33:56.715
Why are you doing this to me?

33:58.870 --> 34:01.673
The shirt.
Eddie's bloody shirt.

34:01.673 --> 34:04.619
Yeah, yeah. But he could've put it over
his clothes and then killed Russell.

34:04.619 --> 34:08.219
Well, how'd he get his hands on it?

34:11.110 --> 34:11.844
Right.

34:11.844 --> 34:15.375
Mrs. Connors, on the other hand,
she had access to Eddie's shirt,

34:15.375 --> 34:18.435
and she had every reason to
want to frame him for murder.

34:18.435 --> 34:19.915
You had the key.

34:19.915 --> 34:22.388
You called the key company with the I.D. Tag.

34:22.388 --> 34:25.755
I told you. I found the tag
in Eddie's pants after the murder.

34:25.755 --> 34:27.661
I had no reason to kill Russell.

34:27.661 --> 34:31.103
Not even to deny him custody of

34:31.103 --> 34:34.065
your precious children that you raised...

34:34.065 --> 34:36.522
while your husband was working?

34:36.522 --> 34:38.569
While he was busy with his women?

34:38.569 --> 34:40.147
I wouldn't do that to my children.

34:40.147 --> 34:42.973
I would not kill their father.

34:42.973 --> 34:46.774
Well, maybe she would...
if she had the strength.

34:51.716 --> 34:54.228
But I know that you don't.

34:57.660 --> 35:01.979
You do, Helen.
The I.D. Tag that Mrs. Connors found...

35:01.979 --> 35:03.496
it was among your things, wasn't it?

35:03.496 --> 35:05.212
No, I told you.
They were in Eddie's pants.

35:05.212 --> 35:07.806
You couldn't risk losing those children...

35:07.806 --> 35:10.992
- to fill that void in your life.
- No, she didn't do it!

35:10.992 --> 35:13.325
Sam, please.
It's all made up.

35:13.325 --> 35:16.506
We didn't make up these clothes.

35:16.506 --> 35:18.859
You bought them to replace
the clothes you wore

35:18.859 --> 35:20.173
when you committed the murder.

35:20.173 --> 35:23.097
- Jason...
- Stop it! You're scaring the children!

35:23.097 --> 35:26.771
They're afraid of losing you?

35:26.771 --> 35:28.816
You?

35:30.006 --> 35:32.846
Out of all these people, you?

35:32.846 --> 35:34.263
Nothing like that will happen.

35:34.263 --> 35:38.539
I did not kill their father,
and you know it!

35:38.539 --> 35:45.366
I know that if none of you
people killed Russell Connors,

35:45.366 --> 35:48.736
there's only one other explanation...

35:48.736 --> 35:53.257
for your suspect behavior.

35:53.257 --> 35:55.700
Wanna tell me, Doc?
What was the first hint?

35:55.700 --> 35:59.885
Was it Jason's remarkable recovery after
being hunched over the toilet all day...

35:59.885 --> 36:04.783
and having to sing a difficult aria
but not hitting one false note?

36:04.783 --> 36:07.359
L-I don't know what you're talking about.

36:07.359 --> 36:09.141
And after Russell's death,

36:09.141 --> 36:12.228
you remembered the research that
Jason did on your computer,

36:12.228 --> 36:14.300
- and it all fell into place.
- No. No.

36:14.300 --> 36:17.631
That's why you told us
you used the computer, not Jason.

36:17.631 --> 36:20.186
You were covering for your nephew.

36:20.186 --> 36:24.224
And the I.D. Tag you found was
among your children's things!

36:24.224 --> 36:27.757
And these clothes were...

36:28.846 --> 36:32.968
They were to disguise
a purchase of another item...

36:32.968 --> 36:35.629
one that really needed to be replaced.

36:35.629 --> 36:38.308
You noticed when Jason
came home from the recital,

36:38.308 --> 36:43.264
he was wearing a different pair of
pants than the ones he wore when he left.

36:43.264 --> 36:49.971
Because the ones that Jason wore had stains of blood.

36:51.530 --> 36:54.355
Your father's blood.

36:55.565 --> 36:58.854
You see what your family did?

37:01.777 --> 37:05.188
Without telling each other,

37:06.441 --> 37:08.059
they protected you.

37:08.059 --> 37:11.781
My children are not killers.
Russell was their father.

37:11.781 --> 37:14.647
Oh, right. Their father who was
gonna kill them with a cell phone?

37:14.647 --> 37:17.961
Who was gonna kidnap them
the first chance he got?

37:17.961 --> 37:19.573
- That's what you told them.
- They're smart kids.

37:19.573 --> 37:21.090
They knew that I was just venting.

37:21.090 --> 37:23.572
Russell would never hurt them.
It was just stories.

37:23.572 --> 37:28.167
Just stories.
What, like the Big Bad Wolf?

37:31.946 --> 37:33.764
Hmm?

37:36.993 --> 37:41.322
But this wolf, it had a face and a name.

37:42.654 --> 37:44.982
You remember?

37:44.982 --> 37:48.188
The Constantin Virnav Orphanage.

38:00.241 --> 38:02.978
That's where you found Jason and Sam.

38:02.978 --> 38:07.428
Where their father was gonna
send them back to if he ever got custody.

38:07.428 --> 38:13.374
- You really told them that?
- I never said that! That's not true!

38:17.076 --> 38:18.975
Sam.

38:22.220 --> 38:26.061
When you were at the orphanage,

38:26.061 --> 38:30.102
did you sleep in the cupboard?

38:32.376 --> 38:36.975
It made you feel warm and-and-and safe?

38:36.975 --> 38:39.121
Did it?

38:39.121 --> 38:41.372
Yeah.

38:41.372 --> 38:45.112
Is that the reason why you slept
in the closet at the hotel and at home...

38:45.112 --> 38:48.483
because you were scared?

38:50.325 --> 38:53.447
Yeah.

38:54.963 --> 39:00.033
And what about you, Jason? Hmm?

39:00.033 --> 39:02.262
Were you afraid your father was gonna
send you back to the orphanage?

39:02.262 --> 39:05.751
You leave them alone!

39:05.751 --> 39:08.183
Is that why you went to see him before the recital?

39:08.183 --> 39:11.271
Didn't you hear me?
I forbid you to speak to them!

39:11.271 --> 39:14.452
All right, Detective.

39:14.452 --> 39:17.963
You haven't convinced me the children did it.

39:17.963 --> 39:19.358
On the other hand,

39:19.358 --> 39:23.821
the evidence against you, Ms. Reynolds,
is compelling.

39:23.821 --> 39:26.171
Detective.

39:26.171 --> 39:27.502
No! Don't!

39:27.502 --> 39:29.063
Jason, tell them!

39:29.063 --> 39:30.556
Jason, don't say anything.

39:30.556 --> 39:32.518
Father was gonna send us back.

39:32.518 --> 39:35.371
Mother said so. We were afraid.
Jason, tell them.

39:35.371 --> 39:36.813
- Were you afraid, Jason?
- Listen to me! I did it!

39:36.813 --> 39:38.940
I killed Russell.

39:38.940 --> 39:41.954
You hear what I said, Jason?
They can't hurt me.

39:43.979 --> 39:45.984
Come on. Were you afraid?

39:45.984 --> 39:48.464
You're afraid now.

39:48.464 --> 39:51.325
I'm not afraid.

39:51.325 --> 39:53.513
I'm not afraid of that place!

39:53.513 --> 39:56.356
Don't you remember?

39:56.356 --> 39:59.980
Don't you remember being cold and hungry?

39:59.980 --> 40:06.527
Don't you remember sharing a cot
with three other children and no blanket?

40:07.454 --> 40:09.272
You remember the beatings?

40:09.272 --> 40:11.866
Huh? The medication they gave you to keep quiet?

40:11.866 --> 40:15.886
It wasn't like that!
It was a place!

40:15.886 --> 40:19.905
Like a school!
I'm not afraid to go back!

40:19.905 --> 40:23.033
Don't say that.
They'll send us back.

40:23.033 --> 40:24.918
It's all right.
I'll take care of you.

40:24.918 --> 40:29.135
When you were in the orphanage,
you collected things, huh?

40:29.135 --> 40:31.059
Little things?

40:31.059 --> 40:35.095
- Like a button, bits of string, glass...
- No.

40:35.095 --> 40:36.763
They were useless little things,
you know,

40:36.763 --> 40:39.503
but having them made all
the difference because they were yours,

40:39.503 --> 40:42.376
and nobody could take them away.
You see, that's what children do

40:42.376 --> 40:47.753
when they grow up in...
in terrible places...

40:47.753 --> 40:51.104
concentration camps, prisons...

40:54.515 --> 40:58.849
and the Constantin Virnav Orphanage.

40:58.849 --> 41:04.037
And you became afraid...

41:04.037 --> 41:08.422
when you thought that your father
was gonna send you back there.

41:08.422 --> 41:10.212
I'm not afraid.

41:10.212 --> 41:12.420
No?

41:12.420 --> 41:15.932
You wanna show me
what you have in your pocket?

41:15.932 --> 41:18.223
No.

41:35.082 --> 41:39.634
Helen, he needs your help.

41:51.909 --> 41:53.913
Jason?

41:53.913 --> 41:56.071
I don't want to.

41:56.071 --> 41:58.181
I know.

42:01.103 --> 42:06.124
But remember how you feel after you tell the truth?

42:07.419 --> 42:10.868
Much better.

42:29.563 --> 42:33.936
Father never even raised his hand to stop me.

42:33.936 --> 42:37.765
He just kept asking, "Why?"

42:37.765 --> 42:40.949
And I couldn't tell him.

42:40.949 --> 42:42.751
I didn't know.

42:43.635 --> 42:46.599
I didn't know.

43:03.193 --> 43:06.604
From a Romanian orphanage to
an American divorce.

43:06.604 --> 43:10.974
I hope New York State will prove
a better guardian for these children.

43:12.186 --> 43:15.963
Well, from your lips to God's ear.
