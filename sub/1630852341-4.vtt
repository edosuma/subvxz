WEBVTT

00:16.083 --> 00:17.791
[Geralt] The Trail will test you.

00:18.458 --> 00:21.000
Force you to move beyond the pain,

00:22.416 --> 00:23.541
the fear,

00:24.458 --> 00:25.625
the failure.

00:26.750 --> 00:27.750
[gasps]

00:29.083 --> 00:31.666
Until you become one
with the killer itself.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.416
Remember, hesitation
will draw danger to you like fire.

00:39.666 --> 00:41.500
But trust the path you choose…

00:44.333 --> 00:46.000
and it will protect you.

00:46.666 --> 00:48.458
[Ciri panting]

00:48.541 --> 00:49.958
Even in darkness.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.041
[gasps]

00:54.666 --> 00:56.000
As long as you listen.

00:56.833 --> 00:58.458
Always listen.

00:58.541 --> 00:59.916
-[distant roaring]
-[gasps]

01:04.416 --> 01:05.875
[bellowing]

01:17.750 --> 01:19.750
-[distant screeching]
-[panting]

01:21.083 --> 01:22.916
[growling]

01:23.583 --> 01:24.958
[blade rings]

01:25.041 --> 01:27.041
[loud screeching]

01:31.541 --> 01:32.541
[gasps]

01:33.208 --> 01:34.250
[groans]

01:34.916 --> 01:36.916
[growling]

01:37.000 --> 01:38.250
[sighs]

01:40.000 --> 01:41.583
-[sighs]
-[branch breaks]

01:42.541 --> 01:44.083
[Triss] Don't be scared.

01:44.625 --> 01:46.291
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:49.833 --> 01:50.666
You're a girl.

01:52.250 --> 01:53.500
So are you.

01:53.583 --> 01:55.166
I'm going to Kaer Morhen.

01:55.958 --> 01:57.416
Is that where you're headed?

01:59.833 --> 02:02.333
I appreciate the suspicion,
but be reasonable.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.416
Would I have gotten this far
if I didn't know the way?

02:08.416 --> 02:09.291
Let me look.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.333
[bird croaking]

02:21.333 --> 02:22.416
[Speaking in Elder]

02:28.208 --> 02:29.333
[chuckles]

02:29.416 --> 02:30.875
Your heart beat faster.

02:32.041 --> 02:33.041
I heard it.

02:41.375 --> 02:42.791
It's nice to meet you.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.958
You-- you're a sorceress, like Yennefer.

02:50.041 --> 02:50.958
[Geralt] Triss.

02:53.333 --> 02:55.458
And a friend of Geralt's.

02:55.541 --> 02:57.458
You must be quite charitable.

02:57.541 --> 02:58.375
[laughs]

03:00.333 --> 03:02.166
It's good to see you again.

03:03.375 --> 03:04.291
And you.

03:11.666 --> 03:12.875
[Geralt] I brought dinner.

03:13.958 --> 03:15.041
More than that.

03:16.916 --> 03:19.791
My child, what a surprise.

03:20.375 --> 03:21.416
Hello, Vesemir.

03:22.083 --> 03:25.000
Oh, hell,
haven't even had me fill of grog yet,

03:25.083 --> 03:27.458
and already, the women are doubling.

03:29.166 --> 03:31.041
-Merigold.
-Lambert.

03:31.541 --> 03:34.375
I see your wounds have improved,
but your manners have not.

03:34.458 --> 03:35.666
[laughing]

03:35.750 --> 03:39.208
I wish you'd come sooner.
We all could have used you.

03:39.791 --> 03:41.291
Hopefully, we still can.

03:42.416 --> 03:43.791
Your turn, boys. Get to it.

03:44.416 --> 03:48.333
I'll go and dress for dinner. I assume
you'll all want to wash up as well?

03:49.791 --> 03:50.833
[Coen scoffs]

03:50.916 --> 03:52.291
[chuckling]

03:52.791 --> 03:54.041
Of course not.

03:56.916 --> 03:59.625
So how do you two know each other?

04:02.125 --> 04:03.208
[sighs]

04:05.291 --> 04:06.791
[crows cawing]

04:11.583 --> 04:14.041
-[handbell ringing]
-[crier] People of Gors Velen,

04:14.125 --> 04:16.708
the end is nigh!

04:16.791 --> 04:20.250
The Wild Hunt walks among us.

04:20.333 --> 04:23.291
-Get in there, you elven pig.
-[crier] The end is nigh!

04:23.375 --> 04:26.625
The end is nigh!

04:26.708 --> 04:31.375
Nilfgaard are our punishment
from the gods!

04:32.875 --> 04:34.625
[guard] Keep it moving!

04:34.708 --> 04:36.791
Take your mind off it, Beardell.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.416
I have done. For the past hour.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.875
Stop! That is enough from the two of you!

04:42.958 --> 04:44.125
Stop fidgeting!

04:44.625 --> 04:45.875
[cries out]

04:45.958 --> 04:47.708
Shut up and get over here!

04:47.791 --> 04:49.208
[prisoner mumbling]

04:49.291 --> 04:52.958
-I need to relieve myself.
-We'll reach our destination by sundown.

04:53.041 --> 04:54.708
-Where are you taking us?
-Shut up!

04:54.791 --> 04:57.333
Please, sir. I can't wait.

04:57.916 --> 04:59.750
Could I be escorted to an alley?

05:00.666 --> 05:01.791
You can restrain me.

05:04.708 --> 05:06.833
Yeah, well, if it can't wait,
it can't wait, can it?

05:06.916 --> 05:09.666
[sighs] Thank you, sir.

05:11.166 --> 05:12.000
Go on, then.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.083
Relieve yourself.

05:23.541 --> 05:24.541
You elf scum.

05:33.791 --> 05:34.708
Come on, then!

05:35.708 --> 05:38.750
-Move, you pointies!
-[crier] The Wild Hunt!

05:38.833 --> 05:42.416
The Wild Hunt walks among us!

05:42.916 --> 05:45.333
Watch for the signs!

05:46.083 --> 05:49.041
The market is too crowded.
Soldiers are everywhere.

05:49.541 --> 05:50.875
Portal us out of here.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.625
I can't. Portals can be tracked.

05:54.166 --> 05:56.541
Then explain to me
how you're not dead weight.

05:56.625 --> 05:59.583
Looked in the mirror lately?
Prison didn't do you any favors.

05:59.666 --> 06:03.000
I have a mission to complete.
We must get back to Cintra.

06:03.083 --> 06:06.291
Sure. The Nilfgaardians
will be thrilled to have me.

06:06.375 --> 06:09.125
We can reminisce
and share fond memories of Sodden.

06:09.208 --> 06:12.666
You'll be entering with their commander
general. They'll make new memories.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.833
They already are. With the elves.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.458
[horse whinnies]

06:16.541 --> 06:17.750
Oh, you didn't know.

06:18.250 --> 06:19.666
Reclaimed as Xin'trea.

06:20.166 --> 06:22.458
-Under Fringilla's leadership.
-Fringilla?

06:23.583 --> 06:25.666
Funny how quickly people forget about you

06:25.750 --> 06:28.375
when you're no longer of use to them,
isn't it?

06:28.458 --> 06:30.333
[crows cawing]

06:32.583 --> 06:34.583
[screeching]

07:02.458 --> 07:03.666
[Cahir] We're not safe here.

07:04.583 --> 07:05.750
We are not a "we."

07:05.833 --> 07:06.916
[townspeople whispering]

07:09.750 --> 07:11.416
[horse neighing]

07:12.791 --> 07:13.791
Cintra it is.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.458
King Vizimir, the Northern Kingdoms
are united by a common enemy now,

07:32.541 --> 07:34.416
but it is a tenuous alliance.

07:34.958 --> 07:37.458
Opportunists and assassins lurk
where you least expect them.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.708
I will not live in fear.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.458
[man] Nor would we ask you to.

07:40.541 --> 07:43.666
We only want to serve Redania
as best we can.

07:44.958 --> 07:47.041
-[grunts]
-Ugh.

07:47.833 --> 07:48.958
[choking]

07:51.708 --> 07:54.666
-[Vizimir] Dijkstra?
-Good afternoon, Your Highness.

07:59.333 --> 08:00.416
[gasps]

08:09.541 --> 08:10.625
Drink it.

08:11.333 --> 08:12.625
[breathing shakily]

08:14.833 --> 08:15.666
Now.

08:21.125 --> 08:21.958
[gasps]

08:27.750 --> 08:28.958
-[gulps]
-[goblet falls]

08:30.458 --> 08:31.375
Oh!

08:32.125 --> 08:33.916
[gurgling]

08:35.000 --> 08:37.583
[sighs] Apologies for the theatrics,
Your Highness,

08:37.666 --> 08:38.875
but I just had to be sure.

08:38.958 --> 08:39.791
Fuckers.

08:40.416 --> 08:42.833
Do you know,
I've known him since I was 12.

08:43.416 --> 08:45.333
Even traitors speak the truth.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.000
[grunts]

08:47.583 --> 08:50.000
The Northern Kingdoms
have formed an alliance

08:50.083 --> 08:52.416
based on their mutual hatred of elves.

08:53.041 --> 08:55.833
But, and if you'll excuse me
for saying so, Your Highness,

08:56.333 --> 08:57.416
we shouldn't give a shit.

08:58.833 --> 09:02.208
What'll happen
once the elves are rounded up and killed?

09:03.416 --> 09:05.125
Once they've escaped to Cintra?

09:05.875 --> 09:10.500
Why did Nilfgaard go to all the trouble
of taking the Continent's crown jewel

09:11.000 --> 09:12.666
only to fill it with hungry mouths?

09:12.750 --> 09:15.875
Yes, speaking of which,
I'm starving, Dijkstra. Get to the point.

09:15.958 --> 09:18.000
Cintra is the point, Your Highness.

09:20.541 --> 09:23.083
We would never have taken it
from Calanthe.

09:24.458 --> 09:25.375
But now…

09:29.666 --> 09:31.041
Cintra could be ours?

09:31.125 --> 09:32.125
If we're smart.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Leave it with us.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.625
[Ciri] I'm starving. Can I start?

10:05.708 --> 10:07.416
[Triss] It's quieter in here
than I remember.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.250
-[Coen] More food for the rest of us.
-[man 1] My belly's cooled down.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.375
[man 2] Talking of bellies…

10:11.458 --> 10:13.750
Aren't there any herbs
or mushrooms for me today?

10:14.583 --> 10:15.708
In December?

10:15.791 --> 10:18.666
[coughs] That windmill
knock your head about, Princess?

10:21.208 --> 10:23.166
-Right.
-[clears throat]

10:23.250 --> 10:24.333
[men laughing]

10:26.458 --> 10:28.958
So, Geralt said you saved his life.

10:31.375 --> 10:33.875
He found himself in my kingdom a time ago.

10:34.875 --> 10:35.875
Helped me with a…

10:36.500 --> 10:37.541
a princess in trouble.

10:37.625 --> 10:39.166
Nastier than you, even.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.666
-Hm!
-[Triss] He's not joking.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.083
She took a big chunk out of him.

10:44.708 --> 10:46.041
But he saved her anyway.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.041
Well, you healed my cheek.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.333
Seems pretty impressive too.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.333
I like your dress.

10:59.833 --> 11:00.666
Thank you.

11:02.166 --> 11:03.916
Would you like me
to show you around the keep?

11:04.875 --> 11:06.750
I actually know this place pretty well.

11:06.833 --> 11:10.833
When Geralt told me what Triss had done
for him, I invited her here.

11:12.583 --> 11:14.208
I brought her here for you.

11:16.166 --> 11:17.291
To help guide you.

11:19.375 --> 11:21.875
What, like Mousesack did for my mother?

11:23.875 --> 11:25.083
Just like Mousesack.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.833
But now it's time for bed.

11:32.375 --> 11:33.208
I'm not tired.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.208
[Coen] All right, come on, you little rat.

11:35.291 --> 11:37.875
I'll play a few rounds of snaps
with you before bed.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.958
Maybe I might even let you win.

11:40.041 --> 11:42.041
[scoffs] Yeah, you wish!

11:45.541 --> 11:46.500
Night, everyone.

11:46.583 --> 11:47.458
Good night.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.750
-Good night, Ciri.
-[Lambert] Night.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.458
-[Coen] Night, all.
-[Geralt] Good night.

11:51.541 --> 11:53.750
[Coen] So, you think
you can beat me, do you?

11:56.041 --> 11:57.541
So how do you two know each other?

11:59.291 --> 12:00.625
[sighs]

12:01.375 --> 12:02.583
[dog barking]

12:04.208 --> 12:06.833
[Cahir] We can steal our way
onto a boat at dawn.

12:06.916 --> 12:09.083
-[man 1 laughing]
-[man 2] Oi! What's under the hat?

12:09.166 --> 12:11.083
[man 1] Look! I knew it. A fucking elf!

12:11.166 --> 12:12.750
[grunting]

12:12.833 --> 12:15.666
-Get down boy. Stay down!
-Pointy fuck!

12:15.750 --> 12:16.666
Come.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.875
You two. Thought you could get away?

12:25.958 --> 12:27.041
[yells]

12:31.833 --> 12:32.791
[gasping]

12:35.333 --> 12:37.666
-I had that covered.
-Course you did.

12:41.458 --> 12:42.500
[Cahir] Down here!

12:47.750 --> 12:49.083
[Yennefer groans]

12:49.166 --> 12:50.500
Oh, shit.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.791
Shit, shit. [sighs]

12:54.333 --> 12:56.500
We're safer down here
than we are up there.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.208
-[grunts]
-Make a move and lose your head!

13:00.125 --> 13:01.083
[flame gusts]

13:04.458 --> 13:05.833
Stay back!

13:05.916 --> 13:07.166
We're not here to hurt you.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.958
-[Cahir grunts]
-[yelps]

13:09.041 --> 13:11.125
[yells] I'm still thinking it over!

13:11.208 --> 13:12.916
Run, Dermain. Run! Run like hell!

13:13.000 --> 13:15.583
I'm not abandoning you.
I'll stay and fight.

13:18.083 --> 13:19.625
You don't really want to hurt me.

13:20.958 --> 13:22.583
Dermain, was it?

13:26.500 --> 13:28.875
Traitorous elven mage,
from the posters, you're her!

13:33.791 --> 13:35.916
And the wanted Nilfgaardian soldier!

13:37.166 --> 13:38.708
Ba'lian, they're on our side!

13:40.875 --> 13:44.041
No one's on our side, you trusting idiot.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.708
Are you going to the Sandpiper?

13:46.791 --> 13:48.708
Shut up, damn it! Shut up!

13:48.791 --> 13:51.583
The Sandpiper is an angel of refuge
to the persecuted.

13:51.666 --> 13:53.833
-What is he saying?
-All right, all right!

13:54.708 --> 13:56.291
[panting]

13:56.375 --> 13:57.500
[sighs] Um…

13:58.666 --> 13:59.833
The Sandpiper

14:00.916 --> 14:02.958
helps elves get to Xin'trea.

14:03.875 --> 14:05.416
We get to Oxenfurt,

14:05.500 --> 14:06.875
he puts us on a boat.

14:08.125 --> 14:09.583
It's just the two of us.

14:09.666 --> 14:12.041
If you know a way to Cintra and help us,

14:12.125 --> 14:15.375
I can assure you
your pick of land on our safe return.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.208
If there's no room,
we'll catch the next boat.

14:29.041 --> 14:30.041
I promise.

14:37.041 --> 14:38.583
[sighing] Oh, for fuck's sake.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.583
[sighs heavily]

14:43.750 --> 14:44.916
All right. Come on.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.708
You're very pretty.

15:04.791 --> 15:07.208
It appears you have some use after all.

15:08.791 --> 15:10.666
Thankfully, men remain simple.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.958

15:23.375 --> 15:25.083
[gurgling growl]

15:28.791 --> 15:31.708
So your surprise was more surprising
than you'd imagined.

15:32.208 --> 15:33.458
And mysterious.

15:34.333 --> 15:37.791
She won't tell me anything
from before the fall of Cintra.

15:38.583 --> 15:39.458
[sighs]

15:40.916 --> 15:43.583
Well, if her mother
did have powers, as you say,

15:43.666 --> 15:46.291
if she was a mage
who never properly harnessed,

15:46.791 --> 15:49.541
the child could have inherited
an evolved version of it.

15:50.625 --> 15:52.291
But it's an untested theory.

15:52.916 --> 15:55.791
When did Ciri start
exhibiting signs of Chaos?

15:56.708 --> 15:57.750
That's the issue.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.250
She hasn't exhibited
any typical indicators of Chaos.

16:01.916 --> 16:05.250
-She can't even form witcher signs.
-What do you mean by "typical"?

16:06.125 --> 16:08.250
She might have the power of foresight.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.083
She seems to have visions

16:11.791 --> 16:13.791
of things that have yet to come to pass.

16:13.875 --> 16:14.708
Like what?

16:17.500 --> 16:20.541
She saw me
at the aftermath of Sodden Hill.

16:20.625 --> 16:21.791
Before it happened.

16:24.875 --> 16:26.000
[sighs softly]

16:27.083 --> 16:29.583
No one should have to gaze
upon that carnage.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.541
That loss.

16:37.708 --> 16:38.750
There's more.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.833
Ciri felt something else.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.250
A pull.

16:45.833 --> 16:48.166
Toward the leshy that turned Eskel.

16:49.125 --> 16:51.958
Like a compass to a magnet,
she led me straight to it.

16:52.833 --> 16:53.708
And then this…

16:56.083 --> 16:57.291
tore it in half

16:57.791 --> 16:59.291
and charged us.

16:59.375 --> 17:00.250
[Triss] Gods…

17:01.958 --> 17:04.875
-What is it?
-I've never seen anything like it.

17:04.958 --> 17:06.791
But it did try to get her.

17:07.666 --> 17:08.833
Both of them did.

17:09.916 --> 17:10.916
To do what?

17:11.500 --> 17:14.125
I didn't let it live long enough
to find out.

17:15.125 --> 17:16.541
Could a mage have made this?

17:17.041 --> 17:18.208
Theoretically.

17:18.291 --> 17:20.875
But generating monsters
has been outlawed for centuries.

17:20.958 --> 17:24.166
Oh, outlawed.
So definitely not a mage, then.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.250
[laughs]

17:27.291 --> 17:29.000
There is one way to find out.

17:34.208 --> 17:35.041
May I?

17:46.541 --> 17:48.583
[Speaking in Elder]

17:49.416 --> 17:51.541
[Speaking in Elder]

17:58.583 --> 18:01.125
If there is any sign of mutagenic alchemy,

18:01.791 --> 18:03.791
if a mage has been involved,

18:03.875 --> 18:05.458
that component will glow.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.125
We'll know by morning.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.833
-But why would a mage want her?
-[sighs]

18:15.916 --> 18:16.916
I don't know.

18:18.333 --> 18:19.916
Mages, Nilfgaard,

18:21.541 --> 18:23.875
something dark lies ahead of her.

18:26.041 --> 18:27.166
I can feel it.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.583
That's why I'm training her.

18:30.958 --> 18:33.333
I won't be here forever to protect her.

18:40.416 --> 18:41.875
I'm sorry about Eskel.

18:42.541 --> 18:43.958
I'm sorry about Sodden.

18:48.666 --> 18:49.916
Those who died, I…

18:50.708 --> 18:53.875
I say their names at night
when I lay down, so I don't forget.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.208
Atlan Kerk.

18:58.666 --> 19:00.500

19:04.291 --> 19:05.666

-Stop.

19:07.250 --> 19:08.416
If it's up to me,

19:09.791 --> 19:11.666
everyone will know their names.

19:12.166 --> 19:14.125
They can live on in our memories.

19:17.458 --> 19:18.916
Perhaps something more.

19:20.458 --> 19:21.666
[sighs]

19:21.750 --> 19:22.791
Oh.

19:23.541 --> 19:24.708
You witchers,

19:25.500 --> 19:27.500
you pretend not to have emotions,

19:28.333 --> 19:29.541
but you do.

19:30.541 --> 19:32.083
I know you feel it too.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.625
[whispers] All of it.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.333
Normal love,

19:38.583 --> 19:39.958

normal pain, fear and regret,

19:46.416 --> 19:47.625

and normal sadness.

20:01.041 --> 20:02.333
Stay with me tonight.

20:02.416 --> 20:04.625
-Triss.
-Only stay.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.875
Let's not be alone.

20:14.833 --> 20:16.041
I'm sorry.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.625
What is this place?

20:36.708 --> 20:38.250
Old elven aqueducts.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.833
Humans built their world
on top of our ruins.

20:47.541 --> 20:48.708
Hand me a torch.

20:58.833 --> 21:00.083
Who did this to you?

21:06.375 --> 21:07.208
This is important.

21:07.291 --> 21:08.708
Yeah, all right, all right.

21:11.583 --> 21:15.041
Some villagers came at us
at a tavern, a week back.

21:15.583 --> 21:17.500
We work… well, worked

21:18.500 --> 21:20.083
at the bank in Gors Velen.

21:20.875 --> 21:22.375
It's dwarf-owned,

21:22.458 --> 21:24.208
so the owner…

21:25.333 --> 21:26.291
let us escape

21:27.041 --> 21:28.375
before the guards

21:28.875 --> 21:30.250
came in for a roundup.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.708
Ever since
the elves took refuge in Xin'trea,

21:34.791 --> 21:36.083
the North have been claiming

21:36.166 --> 21:38.791
that we're all sleeper agents
for Nilfgaard.

21:39.291 --> 21:40.291
Sounds familiar.

21:42.250 --> 21:43.375
Oh, I doubt that.

21:44.416 --> 21:46.916
All we can hope for now is to survive.

22:00.166 --> 22:04.125
There's said to be a pregnant elf
in Xin'trea.

22:04.208 --> 22:06.291
Think of it, Bal. A new beginning.

22:06.375 --> 22:07.750
It's a fairy tale.

22:07.833 --> 22:10.458
We don't have the fight left anymore
to start anew.

22:10.541 --> 22:12.333
The North have made sure of that.

22:12.416 --> 22:14.166
Fuck the North!

22:14.250 --> 22:15.958
Yeah, I know. Fuck the North!

22:17.625 --> 22:20.583
No. I'm starting anew.

22:20.666 --> 22:24.791

Maybe that's our way into Cintra.

28:01.041 --> 28:01.875
The priestess.

28:04.541 --> 28:05.541
Good point.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.500
Holy men are always the most depraved.

28:08.583 --> 28:10.458
Hmm… Hm, hm!

28:10.541 --> 28:11.500
A prostitute.

28:11.583 --> 28:13.333
Emhyr has to like women!

28:13.416 --> 28:14.500
Or men.

28:14.583 --> 28:16.083
[laughs]

28:16.166 --> 28:17.291
That's the problem.

28:17.916 --> 28:20.625
No one knows his proclivities.
No one knows anything about him.

28:20.708 --> 28:22.958
Who he is. What he is.
Where he is. What he wants.

28:23.041 --> 28:24.875
And nothing he does
makes any fucking sense!

28:27.541 --> 28:29.666
We need to get
as much information as possible.

28:30.750 --> 28:34.375
Whoever we use needs to be
inside the city walls for a while.

28:35.333 --> 28:38.916
But that narrows our options considerably.

28:42.666 --> 28:44.041
[chuckles]

28:45.041 --> 28:47.291
Now that is an out of the box idea.

28:48.875 --> 28:51.250
Getting an elf into Cintra
won't be a problem.

28:53.250 --> 28:55.000
But it needs to be the right one.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.500
Someone malleable.

28:58.166 --> 28:59.333
Distrustful.

29:00.875 --> 29:02.750
In all the right ways.

29:04.291 --> 29:05.375
[guard] You.

29:06.375 --> 29:07.416
Come with me.

29:15.958 --> 29:17.958
-[man] Things are…
-[laughter]

29:24.666 --> 29:25.791
Good morning, Ciri.

29:25.875 --> 29:26.708
Morning.

29:26.791 --> 29:29.166
[Triss] You look lovely and refreshed.

29:30.625 --> 29:33.875
Triss, when do you think
we can get started?

29:34.541 --> 29:35.375
Today.

29:36.125 --> 29:37.958
I was hoping you'd help me in the lab.

29:38.041 --> 29:39.958
We can get to know each other.

29:40.041 --> 29:41.791
I can show you a few incantations.

29:41.875 --> 29:43.583
Get a sense for your potential.

29:43.666 --> 29:46.666
[Coen] …and be a great foal to ride, too.

29:46.750 --> 29:47.666
Everard.

29:47.750 --> 29:48.791
Good morning.

29:49.541 --> 29:50.750
Did you sleep well?

29:51.333 --> 29:54.541
-Oh, good morning, Your Highness.
-[both chuckling]

29:55.208 --> 29:57.125
Please tell me you lost a bet.

29:58.166 --> 30:00.791
Is that a flower in your hair, girl?
[laughs]

30:01.666 --> 30:02.958
Oh, she's not joking.

30:03.791 --> 30:05.375
You never got my rags that clean.

30:05.458 --> 30:06.750
[Coen] Yeah, like you ever wash.

30:06.833 --> 30:08.666
-I don't need to, Coen.
-[laughter]

30:08.750 --> 30:10.208
Now that's funny.

30:19.916 --> 30:21.500
Thought it suited her, actually.

30:21.583 --> 30:23.625
[Lambert] Sure, if she's going to a ball.

30:23.708 --> 30:25.125
-[laughs]
-What happened?

30:25.916 --> 30:28.416
Oh, nothing. She just got
her royal knickers in a twist.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.625
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

30:31.125 --> 30:32.375
It's just a bit of fun.

30:32.458 --> 30:33.666
[Triss] For who?

30:34.916 --> 30:38.708
You dress her in rags.
Keep her bruised as an apple.

30:39.250 --> 30:42.000
That is, when she isn't
washing piss-pots or your trousers.

30:42.583 --> 30:44.958
Does she even have a chemise? Or soap?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.041
Or cloth for when she gets her blood?

30:48.125 --> 30:50.000
Though, with those mushrooms
you're feeding her,

30:50.083 --> 30:52.791
you'll ruthlessly deprive her of that
before too long.

30:52.875 --> 30:54.375
You say you're mutants.

30:54.958 --> 30:57.166
That's why you don't understand
what people feel.

30:57.250 --> 31:01.125
But the truth is, you're choosing
to be ignorant arseholes, aren't you?

31:04.875 --> 31:05.750
Triss.

31:07.583 --> 31:08.750
[Coen sighs]

31:13.833 --> 31:14.958
[sighs]

31:17.500 --> 31:20.375
How long did it take you
to learn to control your powers?

31:20.875 --> 31:21.833
A long time.

31:22.708 --> 31:24.291
Just like it will for you.

31:26.125 --> 31:27.250
It's not ready yet.

31:28.041 --> 31:28.916
I can wait.

31:33.541 --> 31:36.041
They felt bad
you didn't finish your breakfast.

31:38.625 --> 31:39.583
[chuckles]

31:39.666 --> 31:40.958
[Triss chuckles]

31:43.333 --> 31:44.166
You know,

31:44.791 --> 31:47.333
my grandmother fought battles
and wore dresses.

31:48.625 --> 31:49.500
You can do both.

31:50.208 --> 31:51.583
-[device rattling]
-I know.

31:52.583 --> 31:53.833
[Triss] It's ready.

32:00.541 --> 32:01.541
No glow.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.166
So no evidence of mutagenic alchemy.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.583
But there is something strange.

32:08.666 --> 32:09.791
Stellacite.

32:11.791 --> 32:13.333
Like from a monolith.

32:14.250 --> 32:15.916
I've never seen that before.

32:18.541 --> 32:21.375
This was taken
from the leshy that turned Eskel.

32:31.041 --> 32:33.041
-[Triss] More stellacite.
-[sighs]

32:33.125 --> 32:35.833
How did two different monsters wind up
with the same dust on them?

32:35.916 --> 32:37.875
[Geralt] They came from the same place.

32:39.166 --> 32:42.041
A monolith? It doesn't make sense.

32:54.041 --> 32:55.708
Tell us what you know about it.

33:03.083 --> 33:03.916
When…

33:04.666 --> 33:06.708
when Nilfgaard attacked Cintra,

33:07.333 --> 33:09.166
just outside the city walls,

33:10.500 --> 33:11.750
I…

33:11.833 --> 33:13.791
I saw a monolith topple.

33:14.750 --> 33:15.750
How?

33:18.041 --> 33:19.583
[gasps]

33:20.416 --> 33:21.666
[harsh whisper echoing]

33:23.708 --> 33:25.708
[echoing] Daughter of Chaos belongs to us.

33:25.791 --> 33:27.583
Turn your backs.

33:27.666 --> 33:29.208
Join the procession.

33:29.291 --> 33:31.625
[multiple voices]
There is only death here.

33:31.708 --> 33:33.083
-[laughter]
-[gasps]

33:33.166 --> 33:35.791
-[Geralt] Cirilla.
-Ciri. Hey.

33:37.041 --> 33:38.125
I'm fine.

33:39.791 --> 33:40.791
I'm fine.

33:44.083 --> 33:45.208
[sighs]

33:49.708 --> 33:50.958
You are brave.

33:52.875 --> 33:54.375
But let us help.

34:01.458 --> 34:02.416
[whispers] All right.

34:04.791 --> 34:05.791
[sighs]

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
When the Black Knight captured me…

34:13.875 --> 34:16.166
[breathing shakily] …I was scared.

34:20.041 --> 34:21.083
I screamed.

34:24.875 --> 34:27.416
And that's when the monolith
cracked and fell.

34:37.166 --> 34:38.416
I toppled it.

34:42.250 --> 34:43.625
How could that be?

34:43.708 --> 34:44.875
[Geralt] I don't know.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.208
I need to see it for myself.

34:49.208 --> 34:51.458
I really didn't mean to do it, Geralt.

34:51.958 --> 34:54.041
And if these monsters are my fault…

34:54.125 --> 34:55.375
It's all right.

34:59.250 --> 35:00.250
I'll fix it.

35:11.916 --> 35:13.416
[children playing outside]

35:13.500 --> 35:15.500
[seabirds calling]

35:20.875 --> 35:22.708
Sleep it off somewhere else, chap.

35:22.791 --> 35:23.916
[man groans]

35:24.583 --> 35:25.625
[grumbling]

35:25.708 --> 35:27.708
-[horse whinnies]
-[door opens]

35:29.083 --> 35:30.375
[door closes]

35:30.458 --> 35:31.416
[sighs]

35:32.416 --> 35:33.250
[Yennefer] Bard.

35:38.833 --> 35:39.666
Witch.

35:40.375 --> 35:41.708
What are you doing here?

35:41.791 --> 35:46.666
And what fresh hell
did you just crawl out of?

35:47.375 --> 35:48.291
A sewer.

35:48.875 --> 35:50.625
-What's your excuse?
-Oh, a sewer?

35:50.708 --> 35:53.041
I always knew
you were a blood-sucking, joyless…

35:54.416 --> 35:55.291
hugger?

35:56.666 --> 35:58.125
Hugging. We are hugging.

35:58.208 --> 36:01.416
Oh, gods, I miss the days
when my biggest problem

36:01.500 --> 36:03.375
was an ever-present, sing-songy twit.

36:03.458 --> 36:05.416
Uh, drink? I'm gonna drink.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.208
I am not having this conversation
unless I'm drinking.

36:14.333 --> 36:15.666
I heard the song.

36:15.750 --> 36:18.208
Geralt must have left
quite a sour taste in your mouth.

36:18.291 --> 36:22.708
What? He-- No one leaves any tastes
in my mouth, thank you very much.

36:22.791 --> 36:26.958
I sing of universal matters,
my dear, generous lady.

36:27.041 --> 36:30.750
Emotions which anybody could experience.
That song could be about anyone.

36:30.833 --> 36:31.666
-Mmm.
-Anyone.

36:31.750 --> 36:33.333
-Mm. Mm-hm.
-Anyone.

36:33.416 --> 36:34.625
-Anyone.
-Mm…

36:36.666 --> 36:38.625
Fine. Yes, when I wrote it,

36:39.750 --> 36:41.458
it did come from the heart.

36:43.958 --> 36:45.416
Perhaps a broken one.

36:48.791 --> 36:50.250
We're better off without him.

36:54.250 --> 36:55.083
Yes.

36:58.458 --> 37:01.625
-Oh, by the gods, that is awful.
-[groans]

37:01.708 --> 37:04.833
And I am going
to find anything else to drink

37:04.916 --> 37:07.791
whilst you tell me
why the hell your sad arse is here.

37:07.875 --> 37:09.125
You're the Sandpiper.

37:10.041 --> 37:12.291
What? No. Yes. No.

37:13.458 --> 37:14.791
How do you know that name?

37:15.458 --> 37:17.541
You pick up a thing or two
when you're in hiding.

37:17.625 --> 37:18.750
You're in hiding?

37:20.208 --> 37:21.791
Because you're part elf…

37:21.875 --> 37:25.291
Yennefer, I completely forgot.
I'm so sorry.

37:27.458 --> 37:30.708
I would not wish that fate
on my worst enemy, and, yes, you are…

37:31.375 --> 37:34.083
firmly lodged in that category,
it has to be said, but…

37:34.583 --> 37:36.916
what they've done to you
and your people is…

37:37.916 --> 37:39.208
unspeakable.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.708
[softly] But some people are speaking.

37:46.541 --> 37:49.375
There are anonymous benefactors
working behind the scenes,

37:49.458 --> 37:52.666
helping me, helping us,
helping us make this right.

37:52.750 --> 37:55.250
Why help? What's in it for you?

37:58.125 --> 38:01.416
I was at the great oak Bleobheris
when it was raided.

38:04.500 --> 38:07.125
The Seat of Friendship,
the druids called it.

38:07.875 --> 38:11.416
Where every free thinker was welcome,
no matter their race, their creed…

38:13.000 --> 38:14.916
They come for the elves, Yennefer.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.541
They'll come for the dwarves.

38:17.375 --> 38:20.000
And sooner or later,
they will come for everyone.

38:20.958 --> 38:24.208
Anyone that they deem the "other," so…

38:26.333 --> 38:27.250
Eventually…

38:29.000 --> 38:30.875
no artist is safe.

38:30.958 --> 38:32.041
[sighs]

38:32.625 --> 38:34.791
Besides, at the end of the day,

38:34.875 --> 38:36.541
if I've learned one thing,

38:36.625 --> 38:41.250
it is that sometimes,
legends can be intoxicating.

38:42.541 --> 38:43.750
Well, Sandpiper,

38:44.333 --> 38:46.958
the man, the myth, the legend,

38:49.083 --> 38:51.666
-I need your help.
-Stand back! Stand back!

38:51.750 --> 38:53.666
He's with me. It's okay.

38:54.250 --> 38:55.583
I need to get to Cintra.

38:58.791 --> 38:59.750
The both of us.

39:00.541 --> 39:02.083
[Jaskier] Well, I'll do what I can.

39:03.083 --> 39:04.333
But know this.

39:04.416 --> 39:06.083
You, you both…

39:08.083 --> 39:09.375
smell truly awful.

39:09.458 --> 39:12.125
I mean, it is like
something has crawled up your arses

39:12.208 --> 39:13.208
and died.

39:13.291 --> 39:14.125
So…

39:16.375 --> 39:18.875
We leave Oxenfurt at nightfall.

39:18.958 --> 39:21.125
Plenty of time to take a bath before then.

39:21.625 --> 39:22.625
Just sayin'.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.333
Coen replenished your elixirs.

39:34.208 --> 39:35.291
Thank you.

39:43.208 --> 39:44.041
Last night…

39:44.125 --> 39:45.333
It's all right.

39:45.416 --> 39:47.250
I can't be what you want, Triss.

39:48.958 --> 39:50.000
What you deserve.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
-If things were different--
-Except they're not.

39:53.916 --> 39:56.000
And I'm grown enough to understand that.

39:58.416 --> 39:59.458
Last night…

40:01.291 --> 40:03.250
you were what I was looking for.

40:04.083 --> 40:05.166
[whispers] Your pain…

40:05.750 --> 40:06.625
[sighs]

40:07.625 --> 40:08.916
…it excited me.

40:11.125 --> 40:13.333
Because I finally felt something again.

40:13.916 --> 40:15.291
You mean after Sodden?

40:15.916 --> 40:18.500
Most of us were cured after the battle.

40:21.375 --> 40:23.333
You can hardly see the marks, but…

40:23.416 --> 40:26.083
Some wounds cannot be healed.

40:28.958 --> 40:31.083
I understand that more than you know.

40:32.791 --> 40:34.958
I hope that in your search to feel again…

40:37.791 --> 40:40.333
-you feel your value.
-To Ciri?

40:40.416 --> 40:41.416
To me.

40:43.541 --> 40:45.333
You are important to me, Triss.

40:46.916 --> 40:50.083
-You always will be.
-[Vesemir] You're going to Cintra?

40:55.166 --> 40:57.083
You said you'd never go back there.

40:57.583 --> 40:58.416
Twice.

40:59.458 --> 41:03.375
No witcher yet has died of old age
lying in bed dictating his will, Vesemir.

41:04.500 --> 41:06.000
I have a girl to protect.

41:07.291 --> 41:08.666
I can't just stay here.

41:09.333 --> 41:11.583
I have a friend who studies monoliths.

41:12.083 --> 41:13.625
I can portal you to him.

41:13.708 --> 41:14.916
[sighs]

41:16.791 --> 41:18.125
Portals are no fun.

41:20.375 --> 41:21.250
There you go.

41:21.333 --> 41:22.750
[whooshing]

41:26.333 --> 41:27.500
[Istredd] Stay back!

41:31.083 --> 41:32.166
[sighs]

41:37.250 --> 41:38.333
[sighs]
