<i>I think about hell.</i>

02:23.935 --> 02:27.105
<i>Though alive,
I think of the world as hell.</i>

02:50.670 --> 02:52.088
<i>To me, hell is…</i>

02:56.509 --> 03:00.847
<i>watching my loved one die for me.</i>

03:07.854 --> 03:10.565
<i>So I'm not in hell yet.</i>

03:41.930 --> 03:43.681
<i>What I need now is faith.</i>

03:55.026 --> 03:56.778
<i>Believing a lie</i>

03:59.405 --> 04:02.116
<i>that it's not the absolute worst yet
and that I'll be okay.</i>

<i>THE STORY OF THE ISLAND AND THE LAKE</i>
BY JEONG HUI-JU

05:30.621 --> 05:33.416
Hey, Li-sa. Shouldn't you be in class…

05:55.605 --> 05:56.439
Li-sa.

05:57.899 --> 06:01.486
Li-sa. What happened?

06:02.403 --> 06:04.072
Li-sa. Let me look at you.

06:05.656 --> 06:06.532
What happened here?

06:08.034 --> 06:10.495
Li-sa. Let me see your face.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.664
I need to take the patient for a CT scan.

06:13.748 --> 06:14.582
What?

06:17.585 --> 06:18.795
Li-sa.

06:21.839 --> 06:22.882
Li-sa.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.051
What…

06:38.356 --> 06:41.776
<i>-What just happened?
-Oh, no. Has she gone mad?</i>

06:41.859 --> 06:43.528
<i>-What's going on?
-She can't do that.</i>

06:43.611 --> 06:46.155
<i>-What the heck is this?
-Are they fighting?</i>

06:46.948 --> 06:48.074
<i>-What?
-What's going on?</i>

06:48.908 --> 06:50.368
-Hey!
-Oh, no!

06:50.868 --> 06:52.995
-Hey, this is bad.
-Shouldn't we stop them?

06:53.079 --> 06:55.581
-Is she crazy?
-What's wrong with her?

06:56.165 --> 06:58.918
-How can a teacher push a student?
-What's going on?

06:59.001 --> 07:00.545
-What should we do?
-Hey.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.132
-Did she go nuts?
-Why did she slap her?

07:04.215 --> 07:06.509
-What's wrong with her?
-Shouldn't we report this?

07:06.592 --> 07:08.511
-This is messed up.
-How can she do this?

07:08.594 --> 07:10.054
-Is she mad?
-She's nuts.

07:13.683 --> 07:14.851
What is this?

07:14.934 --> 07:17.186
I'm sorry, ma'am. This is my fault.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.897
I didn't know she took the video.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.317
How did she have a phone during class?

07:25.278 --> 07:28.739
We always take
their cell phones right before class.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.701
But this student, Ju-yeong,
had another cell phone.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.036
-Not that.
-Sorry?

07:35.329 --> 07:36.956
Who the hell is this woman?

07:37.874 --> 07:41.169
Our art teacher is on maternity leave.
So she's a substitute.

07:41.252 --> 07:43.838
I don't care
if she's a full-time teacher or a sub.

07:43.921 --> 07:45.882
How could a teacher hit Li-sa, a student?

07:47.592 --> 07:50.595
Li-sa was studying
another subject during her class.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.889
That's what I heard.

07:52.972 --> 07:56.309
And we don't think Li-sa deserves
to be slapped like this for what she did.

07:56.392 --> 08:00.771
Are you saying it's okay to beat students
like this if they deserve it?

08:01.314 --> 08:02.815
Goodness.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.444
What's the point of discussing that here?
It already happened.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.196
Mother.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.865
Why did it happen
when Li-sa's father is away?

08:11.741 --> 08:13.034
When does his seminar end?

08:13.117 --> 08:15.745
His schedule says
he'll come back to Korea in three days.

08:19.749 --> 08:20.583
Yes.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.670
This probably happened
because she didn't know who Li-sa was.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.838
Look.

08:26.464 --> 08:29.634
It would've been a problem
if she did this to another student here.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.138
They're done running tests on Li-sa.
You should go.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.265
You stay.

08:40.978 --> 08:42.021
You're not going?

08:45.650 --> 08:47.610
Are you going to leave her alone?

08:57.620 --> 08:59.956
-What are you doing?
-I'm leaving.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.793
Your doctor wants
to keep you here for one more day.

09:06.462 --> 09:07.838
What happened?

09:07.922 --> 09:09.131
What do you mean?

09:10.967 --> 09:14.136
If you don't tell me what happened,
I'll think of the worst.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.138
Where's the car?

09:16.889 --> 09:18.724
I'm sure there was a reason.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.688
I'm not trying to blame you.
I'm sure she--

09:23.771 --> 09:24.605
That bitch.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.191
She's a bitch.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.455
Take down the video
since it shows our students' faces.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.000
Li-sa's dad… As soon as Mr. An comes back,

09:44.083 --> 09:46.919
-I want to have a disciplinary meeting.
-Yes, ma'am.

09:47.003 --> 09:50.715
Report it to the Office of Education
first. We should handle it by the book.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.343
The whole school… No.

09:55.886 --> 09:59.015
Message everyone including
the parents that this won't happen again.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.226
You've got to do it properly
when you apologize.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.148
How dare she hit a student

10:07.231 --> 10:11.027
in this day and age?
That stupid, lowlife wench.

10:49.398 --> 10:52.276
SLIGO, IRELAND

10:55.613 --> 10:57.031
<i>How's Li-sa?</i>

10:57.615 --> 11:00.034
<i>She was drowsy from the meds
and went straight to bed.</i>

11:00.117 --> 11:02.328
-What about you?
<i>-She won't tell me anything.</i>

11:02.411 --> 11:04.955
<i>Not even a peep
when it'll take three weeks to recover.</i>

11:05.039 --> 11:08.751
<i>Even her eardrums ruptured from getting
slapped, but all she does is sleep.</i>

11:08.834 --> 11:10.419
I mean, are you okay?

11:10.503 --> 11:14.340
<i>I mean, how could she…
No matter what she did wrong,</i>

11:14.423 --> 11:16.759
<i>-how could a teacher hit--</i>
-Honey.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.053
Hui-ju, I'll fly out tomorrow.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.430
Are you there?

11:21.514 --> 11:24.141
It's because you haven't seen the video.

11:24.934 --> 11:28.979
She looked clueless when she was slapped.
She didn't even try to protect herself.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.524
Our Li-sa didn't even budge.

11:31.607 --> 11:32.942
<i>Focus on her treatment.</i>

11:33.025 --> 11:36.779
Wounds will heal. But what about
that humiliation? How will we fix that?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.865
She must have been so shocked.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.120
She didn't even cry.
She's just sleeping it off.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.373
It scares me
she acts like nothing happened.

11:47.456 --> 11:50.334
I don't know how
I'm going to face that teacher tomorrow.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.589
<i>She said she'd apologize. If she does,</i>

11:55.673 --> 11:57.716
<i>do we have to accept it?
But I don't want to!</i>

11:58.217 --> 12:00.302
Don't if you don't want to.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.013
You don't have to do it alone.
I'll handle it when I go back.

12:03.597 --> 12:06.016
<i>What about your work?
The rest of your schedule?</i>

12:06.100 --> 12:07.601
It'll be fine.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.194
I took care of all the important matters.

12:17.695 --> 12:18.988
Okay. Get some sleep.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.224
We terminated
Ms. Gu's contract right away.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.768
The Office of Education
can suspend her on their own.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.980
But as she's a substitute teacher,
all we can do is terminate…

12:54.190 --> 12:57.401
Anyway, Ms. Gu wants
to apologize in person. So could you…

13:01.030 --> 13:01.906
Ma'am?

13:08.370 --> 13:10.039
What's her name?

13:10.122 --> 13:11.832
It's Gu Hae-won.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.336
Gu Hae-won?

13:20.549 --> 13:21.509
Let's go in.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.441
Ms. Gu.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.995
Ms. Gu. You should apologize.

13:51.580 --> 13:52.623
Right.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.001
I'm sorry.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.589
<i>-Shouldn't we stop them?
-What should we do?</i>

14:01.131 --> 14:03.133
<i>-Oh, no.
-Shouldn't we film this?</i>

14:03.217 --> 14:05.803
<i>-She's a total psychopath.
-Hey, she can't do that.</i>

14:05.886 --> 14:07.930
<i>-What's she doing?
-Why is she slapping her?</i>

14:08.013 --> 14:10.224
<i>-Did she go nuts?
-Why did she slap her?</i>

14:10.307 --> 14:12.810
<i>-How could a teacher do that?
-What should we do?</i>

14:17.398 --> 14:19.650
You can't watch it
till the end either, can you?

14:19.733 --> 14:20.901
It's not that.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.280
I did it, so I don't need to watch it.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.660
Then you must be well aware

14:30.411 --> 14:33.706
of how your violence
must've scarred Li-sa as well.

14:35.666 --> 14:36.917
Punishment.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.421
It wasn't violence.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.549
It was punishment.

14:43.632 --> 14:44.675
Ms. Gu!

14:49.054 --> 14:50.347
Punishment?

14:50.431 --> 14:52.516
Li-sa brought it upon herself.

14:53.142 --> 14:58.022
But if my punishment was too extreme,
I'll face the penalty for it.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.982
This so-called punishment

15:00.649 --> 15:03.527
looks like a one-sided assault.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.572
What did Li-sa do to deserve it?

15:07.448 --> 15:09.533
You should ask Li-sa, not me.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.495
When kids misbehave,
you should talk to them.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.290
Li-sa is under strain,
preparing to enter high school.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.292
That doesn't mean I should gloss over it.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.503
She did something wrong,
so she should've apologized first.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.088
I could not condone her attitude

15:23.172 --> 15:26.133
of giving me excuses
without admitting what she did was wrong.

15:26.216 --> 15:29.011
Teaching her
that kind of behavior was wrong--

15:36.060 --> 15:37.353
Like this?

15:47.780 --> 15:48.822
Ma'am.

15:48.906 --> 15:52.576
Is this how you teach your students
when they make mistakes?

15:52.660 --> 15:54.954
Ma'am, you can't do this here.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.081
I know that
violence has no place in schools.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.416
And so should she.

16:00.793 --> 16:04.630
And I also know that's not the attitude
of someone who wants to apologize.

16:18.769 --> 16:19.853
Ma'am.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.354
Give me everything in her file.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.940
Her application, résumé,
performance review, all of it.

17:05.024 --> 17:09.319
Ma'am. We are obligated by law
to record every interaction that goes on

17:09.403 --> 17:10.946
in the counseling room.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.364
And what you did earlier was…

17:18.912 --> 17:20.164
Give me her file.

17:40.684 --> 17:44.688

17:58.952 --> 18:01.705
GYEONGMYEONG UNIVERSITY, WESTERN ART

18:03.540 --> 18:05.084
Let's go karaoke.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.419
-How about coin karaoke? Your treat.
-I'm in.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.171
You said you would get me next time.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.973
They just took my phone from me.

18:20.682 --> 18:21.683
I'm sorry about that.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.977
Well, it's not your fault.

18:26.188 --> 18:29.483
Your nails are beautiful.
Did you do them yourself?

18:30.442 --> 18:32.069
Yes. I change the colors every day.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.076
What? You deleted the video?

18:39.159 --> 18:41.703
I didn't delete anything else.
I didn't snoop either.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.248
-That's fine then.
-Wait.

18:45.499 --> 18:49.086
Can you tell me why the teacher hit Li-sa

18:49.169 --> 18:50.462
that day?

18:52.047 --> 18:53.507
Mimi has always been crazy.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.092
"Mimi"?

18:55.175 --> 18:57.803
We called her Mimi.
It's short for crazy art teacher.

18:57.886 --> 19:00.097
But after the incident, we call her Mitto.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.723
It's short for crazy psycho.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.184
Why do you call her that?

19:04.268 --> 19:06.436
Because she's done
something like this before?

19:07.020 --> 19:08.814
No, Li-sa's the first to be hit.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.942
But remember when there was
a huge scandal in schools?

19:12.025 --> 19:14.194
The school told her not to make us draw

19:14.278 --> 19:16.822
or study anything nude
because it might become a problem.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.949
Mimi went berserk then.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.913
<i>Ms. Gu. What's wrong with you? </i>

19:27.040 --> 19:28.584
<i>I said no to this. Come on.</i>

19:28.667 --> 19:30.544
<i>Remember, everyone.</i>

19:30.627 --> 19:32.379
<i>-We cannot blame
-Gosh.</i>

19:32.462 --> 19:34.381
<i>-this beautiful artwork
-What is this?</i>

19:34.464 --> 19:37.634
<i>or the artist who put
their heart and soul into it.</i>

19:37.718 --> 19:42.055
<i>We must be suspicious and wary of people
like him who see art with a dirty mind.</i>

19:42.139 --> 19:44.558
<i>-What?
-Your critical thinking shows…</i>

19:46.310 --> 19:48.437
I guess you take a lot of these videos.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.814
I'm just recording my day.
Like a documentary.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.234
In other words,
I film anything that seems worthwhile.

19:54.318 --> 19:57.404
Then why was this teacher,
Mimi, so angry with Li-sa?

19:57.487 --> 20:00.490
I have no idea. Li-sa didn't tell you?

20:01.491 --> 20:03.994
Mimi whispered something
in Li-sa's ear at the end.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.664
She whispered something?

20:10.876 --> 20:12.211
<i>So only she could hear it?</i>

20:13.795 --> 20:14.671
Yes.

20:16.548 --> 20:17.674
I really have to go now.

20:33.815 --> 20:36.193
EMERGENCY ROOM

20:43.617 --> 20:44.910
Let me take a look.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.834
Keep going.

20:53.710 --> 20:54.544
That was great.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.380
You've gotten much stronger now.

20:56.463 --> 20:59.967
Now, the other way around.
Imagine you're kicking a ball. Go ahead.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.551
Excellent.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.595
The other way around now.

21:10.310 --> 21:11.311
<i>You hit her?</i>

21:11.895 --> 21:14.314
You hit the teacher,
and it was caught on camera?

21:17.234 --> 21:18.944
Hitting the teacher was wrong.

21:19.027 --> 21:20.362
I know.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.033
But don't beat yourself up too much.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.036
"He shouldn't be a teacher.
The school failed to manage him."

21:28.704 --> 21:31.707
You don't have to be the one
finding faults in this incident.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.167
What does it matter
when it's about your kid?

21:34.251 --> 21:36.503
"If you lay a finger on my kid,
you're done for."

21:36.586 --> 21:39.673
"Mommy is here for you.
I'll do anything for you."

21:40.507 --> 21:41.967
That's what Li-sa needs.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.474
Why don't you date anyone?

21:50.767 --> 21:52.644
What? That's so random.

21:52.728 --> 21:56.732
You can make some girl very happy.
Why are you leading such a lonely life?

21:56.815 --> 22:00.610
I've been on plenty of dates.
Don't worry about my love life.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.697
So how is Li-sa?

22:03.780 --> 22:06.283
They're checking the infection
after the eardrum repair.

22:06.366 --> 22:08.493
Gosh. It'll take a month to recover.

22:09.536 --> 22:10.912
Who the heck is this jerk…

22:11.663 --> 22:14.416
How could he slap her to the point
that her eardrum ruptured?

22:15.667 --> 22:17.753
-It was a she.
-What?

22:19.212 --> 22:22.299
What? Why did she do it?

22:22.382 --> 22:23.967
That's what I want to know too.

22:24.051 --> 22:27.220
She said she had a good reason,
but I just can't understand her.

22:27.304 --> 22:28.972
Imagine how Li-sa must feel then.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.058
Nothing can justify violence.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.185
She just lost her temper and slapped…

22:33.727 --> 22:35.103
Right.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.523
Look at my hand. It's still shaking.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.276
But she made it sound like it was nothing.

23:03.965 --> 23:07.969
<i>THE STORY OF THE ISLAND AND THE LAKE</i>
BY JEONG HUI-JU

23:11.223 --> 23:15.310
Ho-su, have some more vegetables.
They'll get rid of the itching.

23:15.393 --> 23:18.480
It's fine. If you don't want to eat it,
you don't have to.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.110
What about Li-sa?
She can't even hold down some food?

23:23.193 --> 23:26.780
Her doctor said she'd feel nauseous
for a few days after the eardrum repair.

23:26.863 --> 23:28.240
She wants to rest in her room.

23:28.323 --> 23:30.826
Focus on helping her recover.
Stop causing trouble.

23:31.409 --> 23:34.079
We had a million ways to handle her.
Why did you hit her?

23:34.162 --> 23:35.956
So did that make you feel better?

23:37.082 --> 23:37.916
No.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.794
You think I didn't want
to slap her myself?

23:40.877 --> 23:43.463
Thanks to your temper,
we can't do anything about her now.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.591
I'm sorry.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.677
Don't be sorry.

23:49.928 --> 23:50.846
I'm back.

23:54.015 --> 23:56.017
-I already ate. Sit.
-Okay.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.228
Have you heard?

23:58.311 --> 24:00.063
She went back to her old ways.

24:01.398 --> 24:02.983
I told them to erase the footage.

24:03.066 --> 24:04.568
You can take care of the rest.

24:05.735 --> 24:06.945
We won't erase it.

24:08.905 --> 24:10.157
She's done nothing wrong.

24:11.366 --> 24:14.411
If we do, the missing footage
of that day will be a problem.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.664
I watched the footage.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.126
Her attitude made me furious too.

24:21.209 --> 24:24.754
If I hit her, people would say
I went on a power trip. But not with you.

24:24.838 --> 24:25.964
You're her mother.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.012
I'll go and wash my hands.

24:32.095 --> 24:36.433
Ho-su, it's been a few days.
Aren't you glad to see Daddy?

24:49.446 --> 24:52.240
Ho-su, have some more vegetables.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.872
Should I feed it to you?

24:59.539 --> 25:00.999
There.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.251
Open your mouth.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.379
Good boy. What a big eater you are.

25:06.463 --> 25:08.089
Look at you eat.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.717
All right. Let's have one more spoonful.

25:13.053 --> 25:16.348
No! I'm going to sleep with Grandma!

25:16.431 --> 25:19.059
-I don't want to go!
-Gosh.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.646
He can sense it too.
He won't be able to relax at home.

25:22.729 --> 25:25.190
But we live very close. This is too often.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.107
Ho-su.

25:29.361 --> 25:33.073
Then go to your dad and ask him if you can
stay here with your grandma tonight.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.201
Or you're coming home with me.

25:36.284 --> 25:37.702
I'll sleep here tonight!

25:37.786 --> 25:39.287
Ho-su.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.251
Take my son with you.
Your son will stay here with me.

25:45.085 --> 25:45.961
Go.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.523
The teacher said
she punished Li-sa for what she did.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.483
But Li-sa wouldn't tell me what happened.

26:10.151 --> 26:12.988
The fact that she won't talk
means there's a problem.

26:13.571 --> 26:14.698
Right.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.701
If Li-sa did something wrong--

26:17.784 --> 26:21.037
Even so. She can't hit
a student that senselessly.

26:21.621 --> 26:22.789
Right?

26:22.872 --> 26:25.375
What's her deal? You must know.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.921
She's a temporary substitute,
so I wasn't in the hiring process.

26:38.722 --> 26:39.556
What is it?

26:42.892 --> 26:44.102
She reminds me of her.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.146
Of whom?

26:46.896 --> 26:48.064
That woman.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.651
She resembles a student
who taught me how to draw.

26:52.402 --> 26:54.321
Ms. Gu taught you how to draw?

26:54.404 --> 26:59.451
No. She resembles the student,
so I was surprised. That's all.

27:00.327 --> 27:03.038
Her name is different.
And I checked her résumé.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.957
She's from a different school too.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.418
Why does that bother you then?

27:10.003 --> 27:12.839
I don't know.
I can't seem to forget about it.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.926
Is it because
she teaches art of all subjects?

27:22.307 --> 27:23.350
Never mind.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.228
Why am I thinking about her
when I'll never see her again?

27:31.066 --> 27:34.444
Don't worry. I'll take it from here.
Just focus on your exhibition.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.696
You said this one was important.

27:37.197 --> 27:39.449
I hope I can meet the deadline.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.620
I know you'll do a great job.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.040
Thanks.

27:47.874 --> 27:48.917
For what?

27:49.000 --> 27:52.796
You sided with me earlier
in front of your mother.

27:54.130 --> 27:56.466
Don't thank me. That's what husbands do.

28:04.057 --> 28:07.769
They are still so lovey-dovey.

28:08.311 --> 28:09.604
How gross.

28:11.815 --> 28:12.816
Right?

28:15.944 --> 28:17.487
My boy.

29:22.719 --> 29:23.845
Was she…

29:25.221 --> 29:28.391
waiting for me to hit her?

29:39.277 --> 29:42.781
SHUT DOWN HIGH SCHOOL OF ARTS
EDUCATION ISN'T BUSINESS!

29:42.864 --> 29:44.365
It'll be an art school now.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.327
-Come on. Keep them parallel.
-Really?

29:48.369 --> 29:50.622
-Hello.
-Hi, girls.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.249
That was sudden.
It'll be a high school of arts now?

29:54.542 --> 29:55.710
<i>Assault?</i>

29:56.211 --> 29:58.421
<i>Didn't Hyeon-seong tell you?</i>

29:58.505 --> 29:59.631
No, he didn't.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.216
She sued you.

30:03.092 --> 30:06.846
She's probably trying to keep her teaching
license, but you'll do nothing.

30:06.930 --> 30:09.140
Let's make sure
no one will write articles--

30:09.224 --> 30:10.099
<i>Let them.</i>

30:11.267 --> 30:13.686
I was talking to our lawyer, not you.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.396
No, Mother.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.524
Hyeong-gi. You're listening, right?

30:17.607 --> 30:21.486
<i>Her actions shouldn't be covered up
because of what I did.</i>

30:21.569 --> 30:23.196
Even if I have to face punishment,

30:23.279 --> 30:26.908
I can't watch her calling the shots.
She's the one who caused the whole thing.

30:29.285 --> 30:32.622
<i>She's just trying to get attention.
Don't let her have her way.</i>

30:32.705 --> 30:34.415
But if we let this slide,

30:34.499 --> 30:37.794
she won't know what she did wrong.
She'll be more brazen next time.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.879
Then what about Li-sa?

30:40.421 --> 30:42.465
Does she deserve to get beaten?

30:42.549 --> 30:45.635
If you knew the consequences,
why did you hit her? You caused this.

30:45.718 --> 30:46.719
Whatever! I'm done!

30:50.139 --> 30:52.350
She should just listen,
not talk back to me.

30:52.433 --> 30:53.935
I'm afraid she's right.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.689
That's what I hate.
Everything she said was right.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.149
How annoying.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.527
What should we do?

31:04.737 --> 31:06.155
Why are you asking me that?

31:06.239 --> 31:09.868
I made you the legal advisor
to handle matters like this.

31:14.247 --> 31:17.250
Seriously. She was doing fine in the UK.
Why drag her here?

31:17.750 --> 31:19.878
There are a lot of good boarding schools.

31:20.461 --> 31:23.631
They'll inherit everything I have anyway.

31:23.715 --> 31:26.509
Why study their asses off
to become doctors and lawyers?

31:27.760 --> 31:29.888
They can just hire
smart doctors and lawyers.

31:32.682 --> 31:35.727
So tell me about this crazy teacher.
You met her, right?

31:35.810 --> 31:38.396
She's a substitute teacher.

31:38.479 --> 31:41.399
But she knew a lot
about the management of our school.

31:46.404 --> 31:50.325
She dared to submit a medical record
she got from our hospital.

31:50.408 --> 31:51.534
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE

31:51.618 --> 31:53.661
If she wanted attention, she sure got it.

31:53.745 --> 31:57.165
TAERIM HOSPITAL

32:03.796 --> 32:05.131
Hello.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.513
Let me take that off for a moment.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.978
Please sit up straight.

32:22.357 --> 32:23.775
I'm going to raise the bed.

32:27.236 --> 32:28.196
Let me see.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.699
Can you make a fist and loosen it?

32:31.783 --> 32:32.784
Like this.

32:33.576 --> 32:36.287
Try to clench your hand again.
And loosen it.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.041
Your wrist sprain is pretty severe.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.169
What about here? Doesn't it hurt?

32:43.252 --> 32:44.379
It hurts.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.923
It looks like you had this for a while.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.384
You shouldn't endure it.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.596
You're not supposed
to endure pain. Hold on.

33:05.191 --> 33:06.943
The gel is pretty cold.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.904
Will this take long?

33:09.988 --> 33:11.280
Yes.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.825
-Then I'll do it next--
-Let me just finish it.

33:13.908 --> 33:16.369
Your body is telling you
that it's exhausted.

33:17.370 --> 33:21.332
Becoming sensitive over small sounds
and getting upset over nothing…

33:21.416 --> 33:23.584
Ignoring the symptoms
will make things worse.

33:26.295 --> 33:28.881
Do you use your hands a lot for your job?

33:29.882 --> 33:32.343
-Why do you ask?
-So I can pay extra attention to them.

33:36.889 --> 33:38.683
You should be careful.

33:38.766 --> 33:41.894
Why? Is the gel too cold?

33:41.978 --> 33:45.314
It's not that.
Everyone who comes here is in pain.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.984
They might take
your kindness the wrong way.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.569
Gosh.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.366
Excuse me.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.415
Hey, sis.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.084
It's okay.

34:06.294 --> 34:09.047
Li-sa said she wanted
to have lunch with you.

34:09.922 --> 34:11.007
Yes.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.759
-Guys.
-When?

34:12.842 --> 34:14.093
She didn't take the meds.

34:14.177 --> 34:15.178
-I'll wait.
-So focus.

34:16.637 --> 34:17.722
Okay.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.644
Go ahead.

34:23.728 --> 34:24.729
Okay.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.445
Li-sa was the one who got assaulted,
and you're sued?

34:34.030 --> 34:36.365
You thought I wouldn't find out
if you kept quiet?

34:36.449 --> 34:40.369
My husband was called in early
because of what you did.

34:40.453 --> 34:41.370
I'm sorry.

34:41.454 --> 34:43.331
JEONG-HWAN'S PRIVATE TUTOR

34:44.082 --> 34:47.210
It's the teacher who tutors Jeong-hwan
when he comes back on breaks.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.338
Qualifications are important,
but kids can be picky.

34:50.421 --> 34:51.839
The tutor has a good review.

34:51.923 --> 34:54.258
I see. I'll talk to my husband first.

34:55.093 --> 34:57.053
Just set up an appointment first.

34:57.136 --> 34:58.596
You can discuss it later.

35:00.389 --> 35:03.351
-But not now.
-Do you think it was my idea?

35:03.434 --> 35:07.271
My husband brought it up first.
And I don't want to be petty over it.

35:08.314 --> 35:09.398
Min-seo.

35:11.651 --> 35:15.404
Hello. This is…

35:16.322 --> 35:17.323
Yes.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.828
<i>I'm waiting in the car
at the main entrance.</i>

35:21.911 --> 35:23.287
<i>Take your time.</i>

35:26.582 --> 35:31.838
ASSAULT

35:35.007 --> 35:36.008
<i>I'm on my way now.</i>

35:55.319 --> 35:56.362
What's wrong?

36:02.326 --> 36:03.452
Let's go.

36:09.834 --> 36:10.668
Mom.

36:11.669 --> 36:12.837
Yes. Let's go.

36:13.462 --> 36:14.714
What did the doctor say?

36:15.590 --> 36:18.301
Nothing I haven't heard before.
He wants me to rest up.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.367
<i>That crazy bitch sued my mom.</i>

36:45.870 --> 36:48.623
You haven't heard? My mom hit her.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.458
Li-sa, you shouldn't curse.

36:50.541 --> 36:51.834
How did my mom hit her?

36:52.793 --> 36:53.961
You want to know that?

36:54.045 --> 36:57.465
It's a shame I missed it.
I should have been there to watch it.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.344
Lucky you.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.972
I envy you
for having my sister as your mom.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.515
You have a mom too.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.727
My mom only sides with me occasionally.

37:10.686 --> 37:12.271
But she sides with you every time.

37:13.481 --> 37:14.357
Does she?

37:15.775 --> 37:17.193
Even if I kill someone?

37:19.904 --> 37:20.738
You…

37:21.697 --> 37:22.865
Don't ever do that.

37:22.949 --> 37:24.325
So what will happen to my mom?

37:24.408 --> 37:26.035
I think she'll be fine.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.704
Your teacher crossed the line first.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.040
What? So you think
I got beaten because I did too?

37:31.123 --> 37:34.877
Gosh, no. That's not what I meant.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.296
-Did you cross any line with her?
-No.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.339
Then what happened?

37:41.300 --> 37:42.510
Thank you.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.931
-Hey, Hui-ju.
-Let's go.

38:13.791 --> 38:17.128
RICE MEAL

38:34.645 --> 38:36.397
One rice meal, please.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.536
Never mind. I'm sorry.

38:50.619 --> 38:51.579
I also serve food.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.001
I serve food too.

38:58.127 --> 38:59.837
But this looks like a bar.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.798
I didn't change the sign yet.
I guess I'll serve food too.

39:02.882 --> 39:05.051
The door was open,
so I thought you were open.

39:05.134 --> 39:08.012
And I am. You don't
have to wait until night to drink.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.015
-Do you want a drink too?
-No.

39:12.391 --> 39:15.311
Whisky isn't that popular
in this neighborhood.

39:15.394 --> 39:17.271
Popular or not, I'll be happy either way.

39:17.772 --> 39:20.691
If no one wants it,
there'll be more for me then.

39:20.775 --> 39:21.984
Please sit down.

39:45.549 --> 39:49.220
A MOMENT PASSES BY INSTANTLY, BUT WHILE
DRAWING THE MOMENT, YOU GET TO RELIVE IT

40:13.786 --> 40:17.415
This is a bar, after all.
I must serve a drink to my first customer.

40:19.625 --> 40:22.628
I appreciate the gesture,
but I don't really drink.

40:22.711 --> 40:25.840
You can start now.
That way, you'll be my regular customer.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.633
I don't like free things.

40:27.716 --> 40:28.926
It's not free.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.396
This is free.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.314
This is a bar, you know.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.238
I hope you enjoy.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.642
Your tutor will come starting tomorrow

41:18.726 --> 41:20.853
to help you catch up with the schoolwork.

41:21.437 --> 41:22.771
I don't need a tutor.

41:22.855 --> 41:26.150
You keep saying that,
and it makes me more worried.

41:26.233 --> 41:28.027
Just until you fully recover.

41:28.110 --> 41:30.070
We'll readjust once you go back to school.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.363
What did Mimi say?

41:32.239 --> 41:33.324
Mimi?

41:34.158 --> 41:34.992
Oh, her.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.369
What did she say?

41:37.453 --> 41:40.664
Of course, she apologized
and asked if you were okay.

41:41.248 --> 41:42.166
I see.

41:42.833 --> 41:46.754
You won't have to see her
at school ever again.

41:46.837 --> 41:48.631
-So don't worry.
-Okay.

41:55.554 --> 41:57.139
Give me that and go inside.

41:57.932 --> 41:58.849
Isn't it for Ho-su?

41:58.933 --> 42:01.227
Yes, it is. I'll take it. Give me that.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.747
Li-sa wanted some pasta,
so we went to Fresca.

42:21.830 --> 42:24.917
And I know that
Hyeong-gi likes their gnocchi.

42:26.293 --> 42:28.546
He had a hectic morning because of me, so…

42:31.757 --> 42:34.218
And thank you
for introducing me to the tutor.

42:34.301 --> 42:37.179
The tutor will come starting tomorrow.
Thank you so much.

42:38.514 --> 42:40.724
Okay. That's great.

42:44.228 --> 42:48.023
Well, I feel awful. We already ate dinner.

42:48.607 --> 42:49.567
I see.

42:51.068 --> 42:53.320
-Ho-su can eat it then.
-Then bye.

43:33.152 --> 43:35.904
Did Hyeong-gi say anything yesterday?

43:35.988 --> 43:38.157
Don't worry. That's his job.

43:40.367 --> 43:43.579
Is something wrong between
him and Min-seo? Do you know anything?

43:44.538 --> 43:46.415
My sister is difficult with everyone.

43:47.916 --> 43:49.293
Tell me about Li-sa's tutor.

43:49.376 --> 43:51.295
Min-seo introduced me to the tutor.

43:51.378 --> 43:54.173
She must be good seeing how
she also teaches Jeong-hwan.

43:54.256 --> 43:57.801
She helps kids with their schoolwork
and mental well-being.

43:57.885 --> 44:00.596
Today is her first day.
Do you have time to meet her?

44:01.305 --> 44:02.723
I have a meeting this morning.

44:02.806 --> 44:04.808
Let's have dinner some other time.

44:04.892 --> 44:07.061
Then can you drop off
Ho-su at kindergarten?

44:07.144 --> 44:08.979
I'll wake Li-sa up and get her ready.

44:09.063 --> 44:10.189
-Sure.
-Thanks.

44:28.916 --> 44:31.293
Li-sa. Wake up.

44:32.002 --> 44:34.922
Your tutor will be here soon,
so let's get ready.

44:44.056 --> 44:47.309
Your friends must be all waiting for you.
Do the Superman pose.

44:47.393 --> 44:49.269
All right. Your head. Oh, no.

44:49.353 --> 44:51.355
I'll drop you off like Superman.

44:51.438 --> 44:53.440
Let's go. We're off now.

44:53.524 --> 44:55.567
Okay. Have a good day, honey.

44:56.318 --> 44:57.403
See you, Ho-su.

44:58.487 --> 45:01.532
Li-sa. It's time to wake up now.

45:07.746 --> 45:10.207
Don't lock the door. That worries me.

45:11.041 --> 45:11.959
Go wash up.

46:55.062 --> 46:56.647
I'm so sorry.

47:11.787 --> 47:13.956
Outsiders like you
shouldn't be in the complex.

47:14.748 --> 47:16.500
Get out before I call security.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.086
Hui-ju.

47:25.384 --> 47:28.178
Things were crazy that day,
so I didn't recognize you.

47:35.352 --> 47:36.478
Do you…

47:38.105 --> 47:39.690
recognize me?

48:20.063 --> 48:21.231
I'm sorry

48:21.982 --> 48:23.442
I hurt Li-sa.

48:24.693 --> 48:25.944
I'm truly sorry.

48:27.362 --> 48:28.697
Get up.

48:29.781 --> 48:31.783
Li-sa's home.

48:32.534 --> 48:36.580
I don't think she's ready to see you yet.

48:37.289 --> 48:39.082
Get up.

48:46.048 --> 48:47.174
Hui-ju.

48:50.594 --> 48:52.429
It's really been a long time.

49:01.521 --> 49:02.731
It has.

49:05.067 --> 49:07.944
It has, but it's awkward
to see you again like this.

49:08.862 --> 49:12.074
Hui-ju, you don't have to be so formal.

49:13.408 --> 49:16.953
If I'd recognized you,
I wouldn't have sued you like a fool.

49:17.704 --> 49:19.039
I'm really sorry.

49:21.333 --> 49:23.835
My husband will take care of that.

49:23.919 --> 49:26.254
No. I'll drop the charges right away.

49:26.880 --> 49:27.881
That's only fair.

49:32.260 --> 49:34.888
I did hear that Li-sa's mom was a painter.

49:36.682 --> 49:38.141
Don't flatter me.

49:38.225 --> 49:42.479
I saw you in the magazine, but I thought
that it was someone who resembles you.

49:44.773 --> 49:46.024
Because I never

49:46.900 --> 49:49.653
imagined you'd become a painter.

50:23.854 --> 50:26.273
<i>I know it's slow progress,
but focus on the basics.</i>

50:26.356 --> 50:29.109
<i>If you learn it the wrong way now,
it'll be hard to fix that.</i>

50:29.776 --> 50:31.236
Your body will remember it.

50:32.112 --> 50:34.740
Fixing a bad habit
is the hardest task of all.

50:37.909 --> 50:40.495
<i>I don't know how I didn't recognize you.</i>

50:59.181 --> 51:02.267
It's understandable
since I did get pretty old.

51:02.350 --> 51:06.730
No. You look younger now. I mean it.

51:06.813 --> 51:08.940
Maybe that must be why.

51:10.609 --> 51:12.319
I guess I'm the only one who aged.

51:14.362 --> 51:18.492
When I saw you the other day,
I was reminded of you too.

51:19.910 --> 51:22.788
I looked at your résumé
because of the incident with Li-sa.

51:23.371 --> 51:25.624
But your name was different,
and your school…

51:27.918 --> 51:31.129
Didn't you go to
the school near Namsan Mountain?

51:31.213 --> 51:32.631
Unless my memory is wrong.

51:32.714 --> 51:34.883
I couldn't graduate from that school.

51:34.966 --> 51:38.512
I was expelled while I stayed with
my family. So I went to another school.

51:39.513 --> 51:42.891
And Gu Hae-won is my real name.

51:44.100 --> 51:47.771
Back then, I used a German name
I was going to use to study abroad.

51:48.396 --> 51:49.397
Hannah.

51:51.149 --> 51:52.234
Yes.

51:53.610 --> 51:54.778
You remember.

51:57.447 --> 52:00.826
I believed I could do anything
I wanted to do then. I miss those days.

52:01.326 --> 52:03.870
Please, Hui-ju. Don't be formal with me.

52:03.954 --> 52:05.163
Sure.

52:06.832 --> 52:07.958
Fine.

52:08.041 --> 52:09.084
Hui-ju.

52:10.460 --> 52:11.962
I'm really sorry.

52:12.045 --> 52:14.840
-Please forgive me.
-Gosh. Stop it.

52:21.429 --> 52:25.892
I'm busy trying to make ends meet,
so I've lost my passion for art.

52:29.396 --> 52:32.732
If I haven't, I would have met you sooner.

52:37.737 --> 52:38.905
I regret it.

52:53.295 --> 52:54.379
Hey.

52:59.718 --> 53:02.804
Some woman was on her knees
in front of your house.

53:04.598 --> 53:05.932
I guess you didn't know.

53:07.392 --> 53:09.936
Hui-ju will tell me
if I should know about it.

53:11.229 --> 53:13.982
So the establishment
of the school was approved?

53:14.065 --> 53:14.983
Yes.

53:15.609 --> 53:17.193
You must be worried.

53:17.277 --> 53:20.488
I heard that many approvals
are withdrawn before the permit.

53:20.572 --> 53:22.574
Li-sa's incident caused a disturbance.

53:23.950 --> 53:24.993
Min-seo.

53:25.785 --> 53:29.331
That's my job to worry about.
Just stop fighting with your husband.

53:30.290 --> 53:32.709
Seeing him squirm
in front of Mom breaks my heart.

53:32.792 --> 53:34.252
You should be nice to him.

53:37.797 --> 53:39.382
<i>The doors are opening.</i>

53:47.849 --> 53:48.892
Aren't you getting off?

53:52.562 --> 53:54.147
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

54:17.837 --> 54:18.964
Is he your son?

54:21.925 --> 54:24.052
I didn't know you had a son.

54:29.349 --> 54:30.517
How old is he?

54:35.355 --> 54:37.732
Li-sa was pretty
when she was little as well.

54:38.316 --> 54:41.069
I remember how sweet you were with Li-sa.

54:44.197 --> 54:46.616
And I hurt your precious daughter.

54:47.742 --> 54:49.494
You must've been heartbroken.

54:50.328 --> 54:53.707
I'm really sorry.
I shouldn't have done it.

54:53.790 --> 54:55.500
My life is so hard

54:56.668 --> 54:58.420
that I keep losing my temper.

54:59.796 --> 55:01.881
I'm apologizing
from the bottom of my heart.

55:03.383 --> 55:05.093
So please forgive me.

55:08.346 --> 55:09.264
That's enough.

55:10.390 --> 55:13.268
-Hui-ju.
-I can't accept your apology yet.

55:14.269 --> 55:18.064
Thinking about the pain you inflicted
on Li-sa makes this meeting unpleasant.

55:19.816 --> 55:22.986
At school, you refused to apologize
because it wasn't your fault.

55:23.903 --> 55:26.906
I don't know why you barge
into my home and are apologizing now.

55:27.449 --> 55:31.828
This incident has nothing to do
with our past relationship.

55:31.911 --> 55:33.079
You're right.

55:35.206 --> 55:37.125
It has nothing to do with that incident.

55:39.753 --> 55:41.087
I'm sorry about

55:42.172 --> 55:43.339
this incident.

55:56.436 --> 55:59.481
You should be apologizing to Li-sa,
not me.

55:59.564 --> 56:03.818
And Li-sa isn't ready
to accept your apology yet.

56:05.111 --> 56:07.113
Given our past relationship,

56:07.197 --> 56:09.699
I should really stay out of it now.

56:09.783 --> 56:12.494
My husband will pick up from here.

56:13.036 --> 56:14.412
You should go.

56:15.371 --> 56:18.041
Li-sa's tutor will be here soon.

56:38.103 --> 56:39.395
I'm sorry, Hui-ju.

56:40.939 --> 56:42.357
I mean it.

56:43.233 --> 56:44.567
I'm so sorry.

57:07.257 --> 57:08.633
This is Unit D.

57:09.217 --> 57:10.844
The woman that's leaving now…

57:11.427 --> 57:13.346
Yes. The one in a green coat.

57:14.013 --> 57:15.515
I don't know how she got in.

57:15.598 --> 57:18.393
But don't let her in
unless she has permission to enter.

57:19.310 --> 57:20.311
Okay.

57:27.444 --> 57:28.862
Gone?

57:29.362 --> 57:31.990
How can an unconscious man disappear?

57:32.073 --> 57:35.660
<i>The nurse said a woman named Hannah
came with papers and requested</i>

57:35.743 --> 57:37.579
<i>the hospital to discharge him.</i>

57:39.289 --> 57:40.415
Hannah?

59:04.207 --> 59:07.210
<i>Hello, ma'am. I'm Li-sa's tutor.</i>

59:14.092 --> 59:15.510
Hello.

59:29.857 --> 59:31.317
<i>You remember.</i>

59:33.152 --> 59:34.404
<i>Hannah.</i>

59:41.411 --> 59:43.663
<i>This incident has nothing to do</i>

59:43.746 --> 59:45.623
<i>with our past relationship.</i>

59:48.543 --> 59:49.502
<i>You're right.</i>

59:50.420 --> 59:52.672
It has nothing to do with that incident.

1:00:06.477 --> 1:00:08.146
She didn't…

1:00:10.273 --> 1:00:13.026
come here to apologize.

1:00:26.331 --> 1:00:27.832
I found you.

1:00:29.250 --> 1:00:31.461
She didn't come here to apologize.

1:01:54.627 --> 1:01:55.628
<i>Hui-ju.</i>

1:01:56.129 --> 1:01:59.549
<i>What were you still doing there
in front of my house</i>

1:01:59.632 --> 1:02:01.426
<i>after leaving my studio?</i>

1:02:01.509 --> 1:02:03.678
<i>How do you know her?</i>

1:02:03.761 --> 1:02:05.638
Why are you curious about that?

1:02:06.305 --> 1:02:09.058
<i>It's all right.
There's nothing for you to worry about.</i>

1:02:09.142 --> 1:02:11.561
Does she know
what kind of person her husband is?

1:02:13.312 --> 1:02:15.690
-I can't hear.
-Li-sa, look at me.

1:02:15.773 --> 1:02:18.568
<i>-Can't you hear me?
-I can't hear a thing!</i>

1:02:19.694 --> 1:02:20.570
<i>What?</i>

1:02:20.653 --> 1:02:22.155
<i>Why did you look for me?</i>

1:02:22.780 --> 1:02:25.950
<i>You must not be interested in what I know.</i>

1:02:26.784 --> 1:02:31.789
