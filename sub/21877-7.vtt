WEBVTT

00:03.200 --> 00:05.033
Is there anyone
here with us?

00:09.000 --> 00:12.133
Adam,
something just touched me.

00:12.168 --> 00:14.032
What?

00:14.067 --> 00:15.898
I just see this tall, dark,

00:15.933 --> 00:18.533
just shadow just,
like, standing there.

00:18.568 --> 00:21.133
And they heard somebody
whisper, "Hello."

00:22.500 --> 00:24.166
I walked into that
master bedroom,

00:24.201 --> 00:25.833
and I felt like
I was being watched.

00:26.433 --> 00:28.283
Wait a minute.

00:28.318 --> 00:30.133
I saw something.

00:30.168 --> 00:32.333
Oh, my god.

00:35.967 --> 00:38.198
I'm Amy Bruni.

00:38.233 --> 00:40.900
I was only 8
when a paranormal incident

00:40.935 --> 00:42.500
changed my life forever.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.965
Since then,
I've dedicated my time

00:46.000 --> 00:49.800
to solving the most terrifying
hauntings imaginable.

00:49.835 --> 00:51.232
I'm Adam Berry.

00:51.267 --> 00:53.867
More than a decade ago,
an encounter at gettysburg

00:53.902 --> 00:56.233
rocked my beliefs
about the supernatural.

00:56.268 --> 00:58.333
Together,
we uncover the truth

00:58.368 --> 01:00.067
behind
the unexplainable.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.565
Oh.
Oh, my god.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.800
Now we are on
our most important mission yet.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.665
Helping families
overcome their fear,

01:08.700 --> 01:13.067
take back their homes,
and reclaim their lives.

01:13.102 --> 01:15.600
synced by dom.smrc

01:18.600 --> 01:20.065
Hey, Adam.

01:20.100 --> 01:22.367
I just got a case in Foxborough,
Massachusetts,

01:22.402 --> 01:24.200
and we need to get
out there right now.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.532
The homeowners,
Holly and Tom,

01:30.567 --> 01:33.767
claim they've had activity
for quite a while.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.967
Even more strange,
the clients' neighbor reports

01:37.002 --> 01:39.133
seeing activity
going on in their house

01:39.168 --> 01:41.717
from across the street,

01:41.752 --> 01:44.232
but most importantly,

01:44.267 --> 01:48.900
the reason Tom and Holly
called is their kids.

01:48.935 --> 01:51.284
Something happened
in their bedroom,

01:51.319 --> 01:53.633
and it totally
freaked them out.

01:53.668 --> 01:55.832
The activity is increasing.

01:55.867 --> 01:57.333
The family doesn't know
what to do,

01:57.368 --> 02:00.465
and they're terrified.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.267
We need to get out there
and help them.

02:10.366 --> 02:11.800
Here we are.

02:11.835 --> 02:13.233
This is it.

02:16.267 --> 02:19.165
Tell us.
What is going on around here?

02:19.200 --> 02:22.841
We've had a lot of action
throughout all the years

02:22.865 --> 02:24.199
that we've been here.

02:24.200 --> 02:28.933
Yeah. So little bits at a time,
so we've been here since 1999.

02:28.968 --> 02:31.167
So what happened
in this room?

02:34.067 --> 02:36.100
Sitting in the living room,
watching TV,

02:36.135 --> 02:37.565
you can see something.

02:37.600 --> 02:41.032
But it's more down the hall.

02:41.067 --> 02:44.165
And everyone in the family
sees it, has seen it.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.867
I've seen it. Holly has seen it,
and Meghan has seen it.

02:46.902 --> 02:48.867
And Meghan is your daughter?
Yes.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.567
- Yes.
- Okay.

02:52.133 --> 02:55.533
So down here is where we see
a shadow going, you know...

02:55.568 --> 02:56.667
- Coming this way?
- Yes.

02:56.702 --> 02:58.417
How tall, you think?

02:58.452 --> 03:00.098
Probably your height.

03:00.133 --> 03:02.600
Is there any sounds
associated with it...

03:02.635 --> 03:03.798
- No.
- ...like footsteps?

03:03.833 --> 03:06.365
How often do you
see the shadow?

03:06.400 --> 03:08.300
Me personally, I've only
seen it once or twice.

03:08.335 --> 03:11.117
- Okay.
- But we switched my kids' rooms,

03:11.152 --> 03:13.865
and that's when
everything was crazy.

03:13.900 --> 03:17.300
So once you started moving
items around the rooms,

03:17.335 --> 03:19.417
activity started peaking.

03:19.452 --> 03:21.500
- Exactly.
- Okay. Okay.

03:23.233 --> 03:25.750
My neighbor across
the street, Cindy,

03:25.785 --> 03:28.267
sees a shadow figure
in this window here,

03:28.302 --> 03:30.032
in just this window.
Okay.

03:30.067 --> 03:33.067
So she's seen the figure,
and the plant hasn't been here.

03:33.102 --> 03:34.098
- Correct.
- Okay.

03:34.133 --> 03:35.432
Whatever is here seems to roam

03:35.467 --> 03:37.983
the whole main floor
of the house.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.500
It doesn't seem shy
around the family.

03:41.700 --> 03:42.698
So what is this room?

03:42.733 --> 03:45.300
This is a den
and my workout room.

03:45.335 --> 03:46.465
- Right.
- Okay.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.400
So when I'm down here,
I feel that, like,

03:48.435 --> 03:50.300
"Somebody is watching me"
type of thing.

03:50.335 --> 03:51.465
Okay.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.698
So I'm always looking
in this direction.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.567
I feel like it's coming
from here in this room

03:54.602 --> 03:56.717
or down that hall
in the back there.

03:56.752 --> 03:58.798
So... and there's
nothing ever there,

03:58.833 --> 04:00.833
and I don't hear anything.
I just feel it.

04:00.868 --> 04:03.300
You know, I get
that weird feeling.

04:03.335 --> 04:05.265
And then what else down here?

04:05.300 --> 04:06.867
My son Matthew's room
is right there.

04:06.902 --> 04:08.132
Okay.

04:08.167 --> 04:09.867
So my daughter, Meghan,
and Matthew are playing a game

04:09.902 --> 04:12.398
sitting on the bed,

04:12.433 --> 04:15.298
and they heard somebody
or something come in

04:15.333 --> 04:18.899
and then whisper, "Hello,"
and they both heard it...

04:18.935 --> 04:21.132
- In there?
- ...In there at the same time,

04:21.168 --> 04:22.967
and they took off upstairs.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.600
So this is Matthew's room.
Yes.

04:27.635 --> 04:28.798
- Okay.
- So at that time

04:28.833 --> 04:30.798
when that happened,
the bed was on this wall.

04:30.833 --> 04:33.533
And so there was nobody outside
on the porch or anything?

04:33.568 --> 04:34.933
Not that we know of,
nothing. Yeah, okay.

04:34.968 --> 04:36.400
- Okay.
- For sure.

04:37.900 --> 04:40.032
Who do you think
is in the house?

04:40.067 --> 04:42.700
I think it could be one
of my parents...

04:42.735 --> 04:43.832
Really? Okay.

04:43.867 --> 04:47.100
...because they both
passed right after.

04:47.135 --> 04:49.067
Oh, right after
you moved in here?

04:49.102 --> 04:50.132
- Yes.
- Okay.

04:50.167 --> 04:52.867
So my mother especially,
my father not so much,

04:52.902 --> 04:55.898
but she passed in 2000.

04:55.933 --> 04:58.916
Has any of the activity
that you've encountered

04:58.951 --> 05:02.109
in the house made you think
it might be your mom?

05:02.144 --> 05:05.267
My mother and I had a falling
out before she passed.

05:05.302 --> 05:06.365
Okay.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.467
So I'm wondering
if it's my mother.

05:09.502 --> 05:10.932
- Okay.
- I'm not quite sure.

05:10.967 --> 05:13.633
Normally Adam and I
wouldn't suspect a family member

05:13.668 --> 05:15.498
to scare their own relative,

05:15.533 --> 05:17.800
but if there's bad blood,
then the activity could be.

05:17.835 --> 05:20.367
Holly's mother reaching out
to resolve things.

05:20.402 --> 05:22.432
My mother was Rosalyn.

05:22.467 --> 05:24.132
That gives us something
to go on tonight,

05:24.167 --> 05:27.600
so we can try to reach out
to them too as we investigate.

05:27.635 --> 05:29.032
Right.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.800
I would love to
just know who it is

05:30.835 --> 05:33.233
and if they're
okay with us.

05:36.267 --> 05:39.500
Everyone in this family
has seen the shadow figure,

05:39.535 --> 05:42.032
but lately the activity
has spiked,

05:42.067 --> 05:45.067
and Tom and Holly are worried
about the voice the kids heard.

05:45.102 --> 05:46.917
We're sitting them
down separately

05:46.952 --> 05:48.733
and getting their sides
of the story.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.700
Thanks for meeting
with me today, Matthew.

05:53.735 --> 05:55.332
No problem.

05:55.367 --> 06:00.100
Tell me about your experience
when you guys heard a voice.

06:00.135 --> 06:01.834
Take me through
that whole thing.

06:01.869 --> 06:03.498
So it was
a little while ago.

06:03.533 --> 06:06.650
Me and my sister were
downstairs in my bedroom.

06:06.685 --> 06:09.767
We were playing a game,
sitting on the bed.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.867
We heard something
at the same time.

06:11.902 --> 06:13.232
Okay.

06:13.267 --> 06:16.067
We heard a "Hello," but we
just thought it was my mother,

06:16.102 --> 06:18.365
and we just kept
going with the game,

06:18.400 --> 06:21.733
and we just kept playing,
and then, like, 30 seconds later

06:21.768 --> 06:23.600
probably,
we heard it really loud.

06:23.635 --> 06:25.100
It was in my right ear.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.132
Okay.

06:26.167 --> 06:28.017
So we just bolted
and ran upstairs.

06:28.052 --> 06:29.892
A bunch of stuff
went through my mind,

06:29.927 --> 06:31.763
"What was it?
Did I actually hear it?

06:31.798 --> 06:33.600
Was it a ghost?
Was it stuff like that?"

06:33.635 --> 06:35.065
So...
Okay.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.900
I just don't even like
going down there.

06:36.935 --> 06:39.317
It's really scary,
and it feels like

06:39.352 --> 06:41.665
you're being watched,
like, 24/7.

06:41.700 --> 06:44.100
When you're running up the
stairs, you just kind of bolt up

06:44.135 --> 06:45.533
because you don't want to
look behind you and stuff.

06:45.568 --> 06:46.698
Right.

06:46.733 --> 06:48.932
And, I mean,
do you feel safe?

06:48.967 --> 06:51.800
It just feels like everywhere
in the house is being watched.

06:51.835 --> 06:54.633
Just always feels like you're
being watched by something.

06:54.668 --> 06:56.865
If I'm just looking,
watching TV,

06:56.900 --> 06:59.500
I just see this tall, dark,
just shadow just, like,

06:59.535 --> 07:01.533
standing there halfway
in between the entryway

07:01.568 --> 07:03.665
and the living room.

07:03.700 --> 07:05.767
So it's actually just
standing there when you see it?

07:05.802 --> 07:07.333
Yeah.
It's not moving.

07:09.133 --> 07:11.500
It was a male, too.
It was, like, a male body shape.

07:11.535 --> 07:13.817
Okay. So you could see
it looks like a man,

07:13.852 --> 07:16.100
but you heard
a female voice downstairs.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.098
Yeah.

07:17.133 --> 07:19.300
It's interesting
that she sees a male,

07:19.335 --> 07:21.298
but she heard a female voice.

07:21.333 --> 07:25.067
It makes me wonder if we're
dealing with multiple entities.

07:25.102 --> 07:27.898
And how often
does it happen?

07:27.933 --> 07:29.767
Probably three times a week,
happens really often.

07:29.802 --> 07:30.900
Really?

07:35.867 --> 07:38.583
Meghan sees this dark
looming shadow all the time,

07:38.618 --> 07:40.725
and she's constantly,
like, asking her family,

07:40.760 --> 07:42.833
"Do you see it? Do you see it?
Do you see it?"

07:42.868 --> 07:44.300
I mean, no one wants
to look over

07:44.335 --> 07:46.098
and see this dark shadow man

07:46.133 --> 07:48.283
standing in the hallway
staring at them.

07:48.318 --> 07:50.842
That makes the family room,
where she says

07:50.877 --> 07:53.367
she's being watched,
our first priority.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.433
We're using the DVR cameras
to try to pick up

08:00.468 --> 08:03.100
on this dark figure
she sees so often.

08:03.135 --> 08:04.498
- So, Amy...
- Yes?

08:04.533 --> 08:05.983
...I'm going to put
this camera here...

08:06.018 --> 08:07.775
- Let me see.
- ...So that we get...

08:07.810 --> 08:09.488
Because they're
sitting here, right,

08:09.523 --> 08:11.167
and they see that
shadow down there?

08:11.202 --> 08:13.067
- Yeah.
- Cool.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.065
So, they sit here.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.433
So these are usually closed,
he said,

08:25.468 --> 08:27.717
and those
are usually closed.

08:27.752 --> 08:29.967
Do you want
to shut them?

08:32.866 --> 08:34.366
Because, I mean,
we automatically assume

08:34.402 --> 08:35.967
maybe it's a car.

08:36.001 --> 08:36.832
Yeah.

08:36.866 --> 08:41.432
Cars go this way.

08:41.467 --> 08:43.865
So the headlights
would go this way

08:43.900 --> 08:47.633
because they point...
The headlights for a second

08:47.668 --> 08:51.032
point at this house
this way.

08:51.067 --> 08:53.333
Yeah. But that doesn't cast
any light

08:53.368 --> 08:55.400
at the back
of that hallway.

08:57.733 --> 08:59.183
Okay. Hold on.

08:59.218 --> 09:00.598
It would be dark.

09:00.633 --> 09:01.832
It would be pitch dark
down there,

09:01.867 --> 09:04.467
and they're, like,
sitting here like this.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.398
Watching TV.

09:06.433 --> 09:08.867
My peripheral, like,
I definitely see that

09:08.902 --> 09:12.251
sitting here,
looking at the TV.

09:12.286 --> 09:15.276
I definitely see
that whole area.

09:15.311 --> 09:18.267
So whatever it is
has got to be...

09:18.302 --> 09:20.367
- Big.
- Yeah.

09:21.767 --> 09:22.732
Hello.

09:22.767 --> 09:26.865
Whoever is in this house,

09:26.900 --> 09:30.300
you can come join us
in this area.

09:30.335 --> 09:32.133
My name is Amy.

09:32.168 --> 09:34.865
I'm Adam.

09:34.900 --> 09:39.900
Holly and Tom invited us
into the home to talk to you.

09:43.633 --> 09:46.067
They know that we can
communicate with you.

09:46.102 --> 09:48.133
So they asked us
to come here.

09:52.233 --> 09:54.067
Um, did you see that?

09:56.000 --> 10:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:08.600 --> 10:10.633
Um, did you see that?

10:14.200 --> 10:17.633
Right there on the doorframe,
the door, like,

10:17.668 --> 10:19.600
into the master bedroom.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.067
I'm going to show you.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.967
I mean, I would
definitely see that.

10:36.002 --> 10:38.265
Do it again.

10:38.300 --> 10:42.600
Yeah. I mean, it's fast,
but I would definitely see it.

10:42.635 --> 10:44.284
I walked into that
master bedroom,

10:44.319 --> 10:45.933
and I felt like
I was being watched.

10:45.968 --> 10:47.532
- Really?
- 100 percent.

10:47.567 --> 10:48.932
I walked in there,
and I was like,

10:48.967 --> 10:51.400
"There is something
else in this room."

10:51.435 --> 10:53.198
Should we move into there?

10:53.233 --> 10:54.733
Do you feel like
something is in there?

10:54.768 --> 10:55.933
We need to go
in that room.

11:02.267 --> 11:06.633
Whoever is here,
there is a green light

11:06.668 --> 11:10.698
on the end
of the bed here, okay?

11:10.733 --> 11:14.665
You may be able to reach out,
grab onto that,

11:14.700 --> 11:19.600
and that green light will go
from green to yellow to red.

11:19.635 --> 11:23.300
They say that sometimes
when they move things around

11:23.335 --> 11:26.100
you get
a little agitated.

11:26.135 --> 11:28.100
Does it bother you?

11:30.100 --> 11:33.433
Is there something you
want done to the house

11:33.468 --> 11:35.167
that they haven't done yet?

11:38.667 --> 11:40.100
Let's listen to this.

11:54.733 --> 11:56.300
- That's something.
- Mm-hmm.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.166
"It does." I mean,
it's two syllables.

12:03.201 --> 12:04.833
It does.
It sounded like, "It does."

12:04.868 --> 12:05.898
Yeah.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.467
That's what I first thought.

12:10.367 --> 12:12.217
- It does.
- It does.

12:12.252 --> 12:14.032
It does bother them.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.832
Let's ask
some more questions.

12:16.867 --> 12:20.567
Have you been trying to talk
to Holly and the kids?

12:26.500 --> 12:28.616
They said they heard
you say, "Hello."

12:28.651 --> 12:30.733
Do you remember
saying that to them?

12:39.167 --> 12:40.433
All right.

12:51.533 --> 12:53.465
They're not
talking anymore.

12:53.500 --> 12:58.467
Whoever it is said
it does bother them,

12:58.502 --> 13:00.600
but, like,
anyone can say that.

13:00.635 --> 13:02.565
Yeah.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.533
We need to find out
if it's connected

13:04.568 --> 13:06.700
to this house or the family.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.098
Something is communicating,

13:13.133 --> 13:17.400
but the "It does" EVP
isn't helping us figure out who.

13:17.435 --> 13:19.533
I need to ask Holly
more about her mom

13:19.568 --> 13:21.532
and the previous homeowners.

13:21.567 --> 13:25.800
Now is there anything else in
the house we should know about,

13:25.835 --> 13:28.098
anything with
the former homeowners?

13:28.133 --> 13:32.600
Well, there was one other thing
that is downstairs.

13:32.635 --> 13:34.432
Can you tell me about that?

13:34.467 --> 13:36.467
There is a board in the basement
that was left here

13:36.502 --> 13:38.298
by the previous homeowners.

13:38.333 --> 13:41.733
It's a collage of their
personal pictures and notes

13:41.768 --> 13:43.398
and other stuff
that looks like

13:43.433 --> 13:46.065
it's related to
their life together.

13:46.100 --> 13:49.733
Okay. Yeah. Well, we'll take
a look at that for sure.

13:49.768 --> 13:53.367
So what was your relationship
like with your mom?

13:53.402 --> 13:54.765
It was estranged.

13:54.800 --> 13:58.032
She left the day
I turned 18.

13:58.067 --> 14:00.032
- Really?
- I think that was her plan.

14:00.067 --> 14:02.600
Did you have any inkling
she was going to do that?

14:02.635 --> 14:04.332
No.

14:04.367 --> 14:06.200
And was your mom
a loving mom?

14:06.235 --> 14:08.532
No.

14:08.567 --> 14:09.465
- No?
- No.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.398
- Mnh-mnh?
- Mnh-mnh.

14:11.433 --> 14:14.367
And she was in a car accident
in her 50s...

14:15.667 --> 14:19.133
...and so we never got to
really settle what we had.

14:19.168 --> 14:20.632
Okay.

14:20.667 --> 14:23.533
If there was something that you
wanted to say to your mom,

14:23.568 --> 14:25.765
what would it be?

14:25.800 --> 14:30.367
You know, I feel that she could
have reached out to me,

14:30.402 --> 14:34.167
and the weird thing was
I was ready to forgive

14:34.202 --> 14:36.332
because I was pregnant
with my son

14:36.367 --> 14:39.933
and was going to reach out
to her at Christmas,

14:39.968 --> 14:42.067
but it was December 2nd
when she passed.

14:42.102 --> 14:43.265
Mm.

14:43.300 --> 14:47.733
So if I were to say anything,
I would say to her,

14:47.768 --> 14:49.498
you know, "I forgive."

14:49.533 --> 14:53.133
So I'm hoping that
she knows that.

14:53.168 --> 14:55.832
You are a strong woman.

14:55.867 --> 14:57.333
- Yeah. I think so.
- You know?

14:57.368 --> 14:59.532
Yeah. That's a lot.
I do.

14:59.567 --> 15:01.667
I gave her the right,
proper funeral.

15:01.702 --> 15:02.698
I did the right thing.

15:02.733 --> 15:04.666
When I went
to her apartment,

15:04.701 --> 15:06.600
there's a few items
that I took,

15:06.635 --> 15:08.032
and I can't move them.

15:08.067 --> 15:09.733
So you can't move them.
What do you mean?

15:09.768 --> 15:14.100
If I do,
then I feel activity.

15:14.135 --> 15:15.565
Really?
What is it?

15:15.600 --> 15:19.467
It's just like a little
diamond pyramid.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.633
Okay.

15:24.867 --> 15:28.300
We found many times
during cases like this,

15:28.335 --> 15:31.733
people don't have
great relationships in life,

15:31.768 --> 15:34.265
but for some reason
after death,

15:34.300 --> 15:36.183
they have a moment
to reflect on that,

15:36.218 --> 15:38.292
but they never got
to actually see

15:38.327 --> 15:40.332
that resolution
come to fruition,

15:40.367 --> 15:43.233
and so they come back,
and they want to make amends,

15:43.268 --> 15:45.198
and they want to make it right.

15:45.233 --> 15:50.333
So I had a very lengthy
conversation with Holly today,

15:50.368 --> 15:52.198
and I learned
a lot about her,

15:52.233 --> 15:56.933
and she had a terrible
relationship with her mother.

15:56.968 --> 15:59.617
There are some things here
of her mom's.

15:59.652 --> 16:02.232
Mainly there is a pyramid
in Meghan's room,

16:02.267 --> 16:08.433
this little glass pyramid that
she refuses to let anybody touch

16:08.468 --> 16:10.800
because she says when
that pyramid gets moved,

16:10.835 --> 16:12.984
activity goes crazy
in the house.

16:13.019 --> 16:14.643
Okay.
So we're going to move it?

16:14.678 --> 16:16.267
Of course we're
going to move it.

16:16.302 --> 16:17.667
Okay. Great.

16:19.933 --> 16:23.433
All right. So we're going
to do the spirit box, right?

16:23.468 --> 16:25.698
The spirit box scans
radio frequencies

16:25.733 --> 16:29.133
and allows entities
to manipulate those frequencies.

16:31.133 --> 16:33.367
With EVPs, we have to wait
for a playback

16:33.402 --> 16:35.098
to make out any messages.

16:35.133 --> 16:37.665
The spirit box responds
in real-time.

16:37.700 --> 16:40.500
The blindfold and the
noise-canceling headphones

16:40.535 --> 16:43.265
make sure I can't hear
any of Adam's questions.

16:43.300 --> 16:49.933
I'll go into Matt's room because
they heard the voice in there.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.733
Okay. I'm ready.
I'm going.

16:53.133 --> 16:55.367
All right.
Is there anyone here with us?

16:58.833 --> 17:01.967
The kids were playing down
when they heard a voice.

17:05.700 --> 17:08.400
Is Holly's mom here?

17:10.367 --> 17:14.900
Adam,
something just touched me.

17:14.935 --> 17:16.532
What?

17:18.933 --> 17:21.733
Who's touching Amy?

17:23.099 --> 17:25.265
You can't touch Amy.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.332
I don't want you to, okay?

17:26.367 --> 17:28.532
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

17:31.533 --> 17:33.367
Can you tell us
what your name is?

17:35.633 --> 17:38.767
Are you related to Holly?

17:38.802 --> 17:40.851
Do not... Without...

17:40.886 --> 17:42.900
We moved that pyramid.

17:45.433 --> 17:46.967
The floor.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.467
We moved that pyramid.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.132
The floor.

18:11.167 --> 18:13.267
Do you want us to put
the pyramid back?

18:15.600 --> 18:17.550
Amy?

18:17.585 --> 18:19.465
What?

18:19.500 --> 18:21.800
So I left that room after
you said you got touched.

18:21.835 --> 18:22.932
I came in here...
Yeah.

18:22.967 --> 18:27.365
...because I wanted
to keep an eye on you.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.466
I kept asking for a name.
I kept asking for a name.

18:30.501 --> 18:33.498
Nothing was matching up
except for you just kept

18:33.533 --> 18:36.333
referencing the floor, like,
the pyramid was on the floor...

18:36.368 --> 18:37.898
Oh.

18:37.933 --> 18:41.767
...but nothing else
specifically, like,

18:41.802 --> 18:42.865
matched up ever.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.767
It's weird because
we got a response

18:44.802 --> 18:46.198
when we asked about moving it,

18:46.233 --> 18:48.916
but nothing when
we asked about her mom.

18:48.951 --> 18:51.600
I mean, we're not getting
a lot down here.

18:51.635 --> 18:53.434
Let's go back to
the master bedroom

18:53.469 --> 18:55.233
where we got
responses last night.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.098
So, whoever is here,

19:08.133 --> 19:12.600
are you related to anyone
in this house?

19:12.635 --> 19:17.700
Holly thinks you might
be her mom.

19:20.567 --> 19:23.565
You can talk to us.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.967
They gave us full rein of
the house while they're gone.

19:27.002 --> 19:29.733
We are welcome.
We were invited here.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.133
Wait.
Go back.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.600
Did that say "Cindy"?

20:09.633 --> 20:12.133
Yeah. That says "Cindy" so loud.
Yes.

20:12.168 --> 20:13.950
Clear as day.

20:13.985 --> 20:15.359
Who is Cindy?

20:15.394 --> 20:16.733
The neighbor.

20:20.767 --> 20:22.367
That is a really
clear EVP.

20:22.402 --> 20:23.834
Yeah. Cindy.

20:23.869 --> 20:25.232
That sounds...

20:25.267 --> 20:26.950
That's the clearest
I've heard it.

20:26.985 --> 20:28.633
Why would Holly's mom
say "Cindy"?

20:28.668 --> 20:31.167
We need to talk to her.

20:38.267 --> 20:40.032
All right.
So, Cindy,

20:40.067 --> 20:41.698
thank you so much
for letting us

20:41.733 --> 20:43.633
kind of barge
into your house unexpectedly.

20:43.668 --> 20:45.932
Oh, no problem.

20:45.967 --> 20:48.165
We were talking with
Holly across the street,

20:48.200 --> 20:53.533
and Holly has mentioned that you
had some experiences from here.

20:53.568 --> 20:56.367
You've actually seen
someone in the window.

20:56.402 --> 20:58.400
Can you describe that
for us?

20:58.435 --> 20:59.698
Yes.

20:59.733 --> 21:02.800
Actually, the tall thin window
that is straight over

21:02.835 --> 21:04.401
with the little archway on it,

21:04.436 --> 21:05.932
I'd look out,
and it looked like

21:05.967 --> 21:08.533
there was a form
standing in the window.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.798
- Oh, jeez.
- Oh, god.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.733
So it just looked
like the outline

21:11.768 --> 21:13.198
of a figure standing there,

21:13.233 --> 21:15.067
like someone was trying to get
someone's attention over there,

21:15.102 --> 21:16.701
and you could tell
they weren't home

21:16.736 --> 21:18.300
because the lights
were off, you know.

21:18.335 --> 21:20.032
Okay.

21:20.067 --> 21:21.398
Didn't appear
anybody was there.

21:21.433 --> 21:26.100
The TV wasn't on or anything
like that to create that.

21:26.135 --> 21:28.032
- Well, that's interesting.
- Yeah.

21:28.067 --> 21:30.267
Do you know if
the previous homeowners...?

21:30.302 --> 21:31.398
Yes.

21:31.433 --> 21:33.133
There was actually a couple,
Steve and Pat.

21:33.168 --> 21:36.032
And how long
did you know them?

21:36.067 --> 21:39.067
Probably since the mid '80s
I knew them.

21:39.102 --> 21:40.632
I was in middle school.

21:40.667 --> 21:44.565
They moved in sometime
around there.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.616
We found that board
that's in the basement

21:46.651 --> 21:48.633
with the all the souvenirs
from their trips.

21:48.668 --> 21:50.567
Oh, yeah.
They loved to travel.

21:50.602 --> 21:52.432
They traveled all
over the place.

21:52.467 --> 21:54.300
They must have really been
in love with each other.

21:54.335 --> 21:57.067
Oh, they were. Yes.
They very much were.

21:57.102 --> 22:00.632
I would go
and help them out.

22:00.667 --> 22:03.433
A couple years after they were
here, there was an accident,

22:03.468 --> 22:05.598
and Pat ended up
in a wheelchair.

22:05.633 --> 22:08.233
So she had limited mobility,
but she still got around,

22:08.268 --> 22:10.833
and I would go over, and she
would be weeding the garden,

22:10.868 --> 22:12.500
and I would go pull her
out of the mud.

22:12.535 --> 22:14.132
Now it seems like you had

22:14.167 --> 22:17.400
a really special
relationship with them.

22:17.435 --> 22:18.465
Yeah.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.483
I have some some things
that belong to Pat

22:20.518 --> 22:22.467
that she had left me
after she passed away.

22:22.502 --> 22:23.798
What did she leave you?

22:23.833 --> 22:27.633
She actually left me
her engagement ring...

22:27.668 --> 22:28.765
Wow.

22:28.800 --> 22:32.133
...a heart pendant
and a pair of stud earrings.

22:32.168 --> 22:33.565
- Okay.
- Oh.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.833
Those are very
special things.

22:35.868 --> 22:38.034
Yeah.
She didn't have a daughter.

22:38.069 --> 22:39.951
So she kind of,
I guess, adopted me.

22:39.986 --> 22:41.833
Do you know
how they passed away?

22:41.868 --> 22:44.232
They found
that she had MS.

22:44.267 --> 22:48.533
So that just... it's kind
of stemmed from that,

22:48.568 --> 22:52.467
and he had a recurrence
of the Hodgkins,

22:52.502 --> 22:56.367
but they both passed
away in the house.

23:07.433 --> 23:09.367
There's a lot more
going on in this house

23:09.402 --> 23:11.165
than we originally thought.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.032
The former homeowners,
Pat and Steve,

23:13.067 --> 23:16.265
lived here for years,
but they also died here.

23:16.300 --> 23:21.067
We need to step away and come up
with a new game plan.

23:21.102 --> 23:23.665
So this case
is pretty crazy.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.816
It's different in the sense
that the people

23:25.851 --> 23:27.898
we're dealing with
have been experiencing

23:27.933 --> 23:30.233
this activity in their house
for quite for some time,

23:30.268 --> 23:32.533
and to Holly especially,
she just kind of assumed

23:32.568 --> 23:34.865
it was her mom, because
her mom died

23:34.900 --> 23:36.933
right around the time
they both this house.

23:36.968 --> 23:39.034
So Cindy,
she's seeing activity.

23:39.069 --> 23:41.100
We need to, like,
get in that house

23:41.135 --> 23:44.065
and monitor that situation.

23:44.100 --> 23:46.433
I mean, there's a lot
of things going on.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.767
What I think is interesting
about this is we

23:48.802 --> 23:51.432
basically have two locations,

23:51.467 --> 23:55.433
but one thing I think we need
to really focus on is the stuff.

23:55.468 --> 23:58.733
I feel like the objects
have something to do with it.

23:58.768 --> 24:01.684
I mean, they have
a large collage of everything

24:01.719 --> 24:04.600
of the previous homeowners
ever did together,

24:04.635 --> 24:06.501
you know,
and then here's Cindy

24:06.536 --> 24:08.332
who has some
of the belongings

24:08.367 --> 24:10.432
of the former owners,
Pat and Steve.

24:10.467 --> 24:13.017
She might not even realize
there could be

24:13.052 --> 24:15.567
some sort of attachment
to what she has,

24:15.602 --> 24:19.365
and I'm betting
that Tom and Holly

24:19.400 --> 24:22.767
have no idea that all these
objects could be involved.

24:22.802 --> 24:23.932
We need to get into
Cindy's house.

24:23.967 --> 24:25.517
Like, we have to get
into Cindy's house

24:25.552 --> 24:27.067
and start monitoring
the other house.

24:27.102 --> 24:29.467
- We need help.
- Right.

24:34.133 --> 24:36.567
We have some friends
named Greg and Dana.

24:36.602 --> 24:38.465
They're perfect for this case.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.032
They have a combined
35 years experience

24:41.067 --> 24:44.533
specializing in haunted objects,
which we have a lot of,

24:44.568 --> 24:46.833
but Greg and Dana
are also skilled

24:46.868 --> 24:48.365
paranormal investigators,

24:48.400 --> 24:51.433
which is good because
now we have two locations

24:51.468 --> 24:53.867
and we can't be
in both places at once.

24:56.367 --> 24:59.032
- What's going on?
- Well, a lot.

24:59.067 --> 25:02.500
Basically what we've got here
is we have two locations.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.333
You know, this place,
there are some objects

25:04.368 --> 25:05.900
that we feel like
the former owners

25:05.935 --> 25:08.498
might be very attached to,

25:08.533 --> 25:10.983
and then we brought
some objects from next door

25:11.018 --> 25:13.433
as well that we think
they might be attached to.

25:13.468 --> 25:16.533
So I think our hope
is to maybe split up,

25:16.568 --> 25:18.832
and you guys can stay here

25:18.867 --> 25:20.467
and keep monitoring
these objects

25:20.502 --> 25:22.032
while we go across the street.

25:22.067 --> 25:24.800
Because they say they see
an apparition in this window.

25:24.835 --> 25:27.467
And then, after that,
we can all investigate

25:27.502 --> 25:29.633
together downstairs
for a bit.

25:29.668 --> 25:32.098
Absolutely.

25:32.133 --> 25:34.033
So this is where they have...

25:34.068 --> 25:35.898
They've had activity down here,

25:35.933 --> 25:39.900
but there's also
this amazing board.

25:39.935 --> 25:43.365
I have these objects,

25:43.400 --> 25:46.250
which is a pair
of earrings in here,

25:46.285 --> 25:48.309
the engagement ring
and the necklace.

25:48.344 --> 25:50.333
So you guys can use
these for sure.

25:50.368 --> 25:51.298
Wonderful.

25:51.333 --> 25:52.765
We brought the dark mirror,

25:52.800 --> 25:54.650
which charges up
the energy in a place,

25:54.685 --> 25:56.500
and a lot of manifestations
tend to happen

25:56.535 --> 25:58.151
around the mirror itself.

25:58.186 --> 25:59.767
- Yeah. Okay.
- Awesome.

26:04.100 --> 26:07.233
When we investigate a house,
we are in that house.

26:07.268 --> 26:10.367
This is the first time
we've gone to another location

26:10.402 --> 26:12.832
to do a ghost
stakeout on a home.

26:12.867 --> 26:15.800
Hopefully Greg and Dana
investigating around the items

26:15.835 --> 26:18.133
will help stir up
whatever is here,

26:18.168 --> 26:19.532
and we get to try to experience

26:19.567 --> 26:22.133
what Cindy has seen
from across the street.

26:22.168 --> 26:24.198
So from here, I mean,

26:24.233 --> 26:29.398
I see Greg and Dana
walking around.

26:29.433 --> 26:31.067
So you would be able to see...
Yeah. You can -

26:31.102 --> 26:32.665
...you would be able
to see somebody.

26:32.700 --> 26:35.267
I would love to have one of them
walk in front of that window,

26:35.302 --> 26:37.767
and then we could see
what it looks like.

26:37.802 --> 26:40.532
Can one of you guys
walk upstairs

26:40.567 --> 26:43.500
and get in front of that
window that we're looking at?

26:43.535 --> 26:44.667
Do you want me to go,
or do you want...

26:44.702 --> 26:46.867
Dana will go.

26:50.667 --> 26:52.317
All right.
I'm here.

26:52.352 --> 26:53.932
She's in the window now?

26:53.967 --> 26:56.498
Are you in the window
right now?

26:56.533 --> 26:59.465
- I'm in the window.
- Oh, there she is.

26:59.500 --> 27:04.267
Can you walk in front of the
window from your left to right?

27:04.302 --> 27:05.667
You got it.

27:10.267 --> 27:12.433
Go back.

27:12.468 --> 27:14.600
And go back.

27:17.133 --> 27:20.432
Okay. I see that.
Mmhmm. Okay.

27:20.467 --> 27:21.700
Do we let her go back
to her investigation?

27:21.735 --> 27:23.232
Yeah.
Let her go.

27:23.267 --> 27:24.200
All right.
You can go back downstairs.

27:24.235 --> 27:25.533
Thanks so much, Dana.

27:25.568 --> 27:27.800
No problem.

27:29.333 --> 27:31.300
Okay.

27:34.133 --> 27:35.133
I'm going to start
with a session.

27:35.168 --> 27:37.665
Mm-hmm.

27:37.700 --> 27:40.033
If there is anyone
in this basement with us,

27:40.068 --> 27:42.367
we'd really appreciate it
if you'd come down

27:42.402 --> 27:44.698
and say, "Hello."

27:44.733 --> 27:47.400
We've heard that you might
not have like that the fact

27:47.435 --> 27:51.167
that this mural was removed,
is that true?

27:53.467 --> 27:54.633
- Play it back.
- Call that good?

27:54.668 --> 27:56.400
Mm-hmm.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.932
I know that Cindy
doesn't see it all the time,

28:01.967 --> 28:05.133
but the reality is we are riling
things up over there right now

28:05.168 --> 28:07.634
because not only have
we been investigating,

28:07.669 --> 28:10.100
but now we just brought
Greg and Dana here.

28:12.067 --> 28:16.233
It literally looks like someone
is standing in that window.

28:16.268 --> 28:17.832
Wait a minute.

28:17.867 --> 28:20.198
Is anybody up there?

28:20.233 --> 28:22.516
If there is anyone in this
basement with us,

28:22.551 --> 28:24.800
we'd really appreciate it
if you'd come down

28:24.835 --> 28:27.067
and say, "Hello."

28:35.067 --> 28:36.517
Put it back.

28:36.552 --> 28:37.967
Oh, my god.

28:50.467 --> 28:52.400
Adam and I
normally investigate

28:52.435 --> 28:54.298
a home's activity
from the inside.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.916
It's not often we're
investigating a claim

28:56.951 --> 28:59.442
that spirits can be seen
from another house.

28:59.477 --> 29:01.933
The activity just picked up
on the top floor

29:01.968 --> 29:03.665
the exact time Greg and Dana

29:03.700 --> 29:06.433
starting getting some
responses in the basement.

29:16.167 --> 29:18.017
Put it back.

29:18.052 --> 29:19.867
Oh, my god.

29:21.633 --> 29:25.533
It's weird because
it literally looks like someone

29:25.557 --> 29:27.397
is standing in that window.

29:27.421 --> 29:29.399
Is anybody upstairs?

29:29.400 --> 29:31.583
Nope.
No one is up there.

29:31.618 --> 29:33.732
I absolutely, 100 percent,

29:33.767 --> 29:36.067
saw somebody walk
in front of that window.

29:36.102 --> 29:38.133
- That's weird.
- That's very weird.

29:38.168 --> 29:40.167
Okay.
Let's go back over there.

29:42.200 --> 29:46.332
It was a crazy experience
to actually see what Cindy sees.

29:46.367 --> 29:50.433
I really think us being here is
triggering something to come out

29:50.468 --> 29:55.098
and to actually see it
is pretty compelling.

29:55.133 --> 30:00.000
I say distinctly someone move
across the windows upstairs,

30:00.035 --> 30:04.867
and I say distinctly, "Oh,
she's still up there, right?"

30:04.902 --> 30:06.367
I'm like, "Wait,
isn't she still up there?"

30:06.402 --> 30:07.667
And that's
when I walkied over,

30:07.702 --> 30:09.201
you are not up here.

30:09.236 --> 30:10.684
- Mnh-mnh.
- No.

30:10.719 --> 30:12.098
So what happened?

30:12.133 --> 30:13.698
I want to play what we got,

30:13.733 --> 30:16.100
and I don't want to
tell you what we heard.

30:28.467 --> 30:29.565
Oh, right there.
Put it back.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.750
- Yeah, put it back.
- Put it back.

30:31.785 --> 30:34.259
- Mm-hmm.
- It is really quiet.

30:34.294 --> 30:37.247
Let's ask some
more questions.

30:37.282 --> 30:41.007
Are you concerned
that they are

30:41.042 --> 30:44.733
going to destroy
this art piece?

30:47.467 --> 30:52.000
We're trying to figure out
if you have a message.

30:52.035 --> 30:55.698
Is that the case?

30:55.733 --> 30:59.333
Are you okay with the changes
that they've made to the house?

31:03.100 --> 31:05.300
Do the changes bother you?

31:10.167 --> 31:12.833
Let's listen and see
if there's anything.

31:21.267 --> 31:23.300
- Oh, my god.
- It sounded like...

31:23.335 --> 31:24.467
What does it say?

31:32.100 --> 31:33.600
No way.
I could hear that. Yeah.

31:33.635 --> 31:35.100
I don't think...
Yeah, they know.

31:49.167 --> 31:52.467
It definitely appears they don't
like when things get moved,

31:52.502 --> 31:55.798
but this "No way" EVP seems like
they're not angry

31:55.833 --> 31:59.233
and trust Holly and Tom
will keep their mural in place.

31:59.268 --> 32:01.298
What do you think
is going on here?

32:01.333 --> 32:03.433
It seems like they're
very ready to talk.

32:03.468 --> 32:05.700
I think what they didn't
have are people

32:05.735 --> 32:07.898
who are listening
very intently before.

32:07.933 --> 32:11.133
All right. Well, thank you,
guys, and we'll... yeah.

32:11.168 --> 32:12.600
We'll let you know
how everything turns out.

32:12.635 --> 32:13.800
Please do.
I can't wait to hear it.

32:13.835 --> 32:15.833
Yes, please.

32:18.700 --> 32:21.667
I think her mom is not here.
I mean...

32:21.702 --> 32:23.132
No. I don't.

32:23.167 --> 32:26.032
I haven't, I mean,
we've gotten nothing.

32:26.067 --> 32:29.967
I just really wanted to give
Holly an answer.

32:30.002 --> 32:32.765
I mean, if Pat and Steve
are here,

32:32.800 --> 32:34.900
then I think we need to get
Cindy over here.

32:34.935 --> 32:37.001
Yeah.
Get more answers.

32:37.036 --> 32:39.032
Yeah.
So let's do that.

32:39.067 --> 32:41.067
Let's just see if she'll come
over and investigate with us.

32:45.133 --> 32:47.098
We got an EVP about
the former homeowners',

32:47.133 --> 32:51.400
Pat and Steve's, travel board,
but that's only one EVP.

32:51.435 --> 32:53.032
Meghan sees
a male shadow figure,

32:53.067 --> 32:55.300
and both the kids
heard a female voice.

32:55.335 --> 32:57.233
Could both Pat
and Steve be here?

32:57.268 --> 32:59.000
Or is someone else here?

32:59.035 --> 33:00.698
We can't rule anything out.

33:00.733 --> 33:02.316
Very early on
in this investigation,

33:02.351 --> 33:03.900
we're getting
responses to Cindy.

33:03.935 --> 33:05.365
We're getting Cindy's name.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.600
So we're going to have to bring
Cindy into this investigation.

33:07.635 --> 33:09.532
We need to see
if whoever is here

33:09.567 --> 33:11.300
is going to react to
when we bring her in.

33:11.335 --> 33:13.767
So let's grab
some equipment.

33:19.500 --> 33:22.465
So let's do this.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.032
What this is, is it's
a proximity sensor.

33:25.067 --> 33:28.267
The proximity sensor gives off
an electromagnetic field

33:28.302 --> 33:30.665
around objects
it's attached to.

33:30.700 --> 33:34.367
If anything that conducts
electricity disturbs that field,

33:34.402 --> 33:36.532
an alarm sounds to let us know.

33:36.567 --> 33:38.867
Literally if I get close it,
this is now a conducter.

33:38.902 --> 33:40.465
So I feel, like...
Oh.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.567
...if anyone reaches out
to touch it.

33:42.602 --> 33:44.500
Yeah.
The alarm goes off.

33:44.535 --> 33:45.898
It's pretty handy.

33:45.933 --> 33:49.267
I mean, I guess maybe you can
help us figure out if why.

33:49.302 --> 33:51.467
I mean, like, why.
Do they like the changes?

33:51.502 --> 33:52.600
Do they like the things?

33:52.635 --> 33:53.765
Question.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.500
How tall was Steve,
would you say?

33:55.535 --> 33:57.898
Was he a tall man?

33:57.933 --> 34:01.367
He was actually probably
around Adam's height.

34:01.402 --> 34:03.101
How tall, you think?

34:03.136 --> 34:04.800
Probably your height.

34:06.333 --> 34:08.850
All right.

34:08.885 --> 34:11.331
I know.

34:11.367 --> 34:13.967
- What?
- You and me out of here.

34:14.002 --> 34:15.300
Oh.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.783
Hey, Pat, Steve.

34:27.818 --> 34:30.141
It's just me now.

34:30.177 --> 34:32.467
Can you talk to me?

34:35.632 --> 34:37.297
If you talk to into
this recorder down here,

34:37.333 --> 34:42.900
they'll hear you, and then I'll
be able to hear you,

34:42.935 --> 34:45.667
and I promise I'll never,
never ever get rid

34:45.702 --> 34:49.583
of your wonderful gifts to me.

34:49.619 --> 34:53.431
Anything you want to tell me?

34:53.467 --> 34:56.867
All right. Let's go listen
and see what she got.

35:03.467 --> 35:05.700
Okay.

35:21.433 --> 35:23.133
- What was that? Oh, my god.
- Wait, wait, wait.

35:23.168 --> 35:24.398
Let it finish.

35:24.433 --> 35:26.500
Something about the bed.

35:35.933 --> 35:37.333
Is it,
"They're on the bed?"

35:37.368 --> 35:38.298
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:38.333 --> 35:39.300
That's,
"They're on the bed."

35:39.335 --> 35:40.267
Yeah.
They're on the bed.

35:40.302 --> 35:41.733
They're on the bed.

35:45.933 --> 35:49.067
Something is touching that.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.265
Something about the bed.

36:02.300 --> 36:03.500
Is it,
"They're on the bed?"

36:03.535 --> 36:04.865
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.600
- That's, "They're on the bed."
- Yeah. They're on the bed.

36:06.635 --> 36:08.100
They're on the bed.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.067
Something is touching that.

36:18.267 --> 36:20.167
Shut your mouth.

36:22.167 --> 36:25.165
Yes. It's on the bed, you guys.
It's funny that...

36:25.200 --> 36:26.800
It's almost like they're
pointing it out to each other.

36:30.433 --> 36:33.933
Who's touching it?
Is it Pat?

36:40.433 --> 36:42.065
Pat.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.800
Pat.
It says Pat.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.465
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.200
I kind of want to ask a couple
more things at Steve.

36:47.235 --> 36:49.067
Me, too.

36:51.800 --> 36:56.167
These items that you
gave to Cindy, Pat,

36:56.202 --> 36:59.400
she still holds on to them.

36:59.435 --> 37:01.533
Do you like that?

37:02.900 --> 37:05.867
Anything you want
to tell me?

37:05.902 --> 37:09.532
Happy to listen.

37:09.567 --> 37:13.167
Is there a reason
while you're still here?

37:15.433 --> 37:18.100
Let's listen to the recorder.

37:38.900 --> 37:40.565
It's quiet.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.198
I mean, we know
why they're here.

37:42.233 --> 37:44.716
They're here because
this was their home.

37:44.751 --> 37:47.200
They have a connection
to this neighborhood,

37:47.235 --> 37:48.765
a connection to Cindy.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.967
Does that sound
like them to you?

37:51.002 --> 37:53.367
I believe it's them.

37:55.700 --> 37:56.900
Thank you so much, Cindy.

37:56.935 --> 37:58.565
Oh, no. I'm glad.

37:58.600 --> 38:01.833
I'm glad it helped, you know,
bring them out.

38:01.868 --> 38:03.233
It was great
to have you here.

38:03.268 --> 38:04.565
Oh, thank you.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.700
Normally we just wrap
things up for our clients,

38:06.735 --> 38:08.467
but in this case,
we gave Cindy,

38:08.502 --> 38:10.200
a friend of the
former homeowners,

38:10.235 --> 38:11.398
a beautiful message.

38:11.433 --> 38:14.798
Pat and Steve are still here
and remember her.

38:14.833 --> 38:16.467
Now we're going to present
the rest of the evidence

38:16.502 --> 38:19.067
to Tom and Holly.

38:26.867 --> 38:28.333
How are you guys
feeling right now?

38:28.368 --> 38:29.934
What are you thinking?

38:29.969 --> 38:31.651
I really have no idea.

38:31.686 --> 38:33.298
I just want to know.

38:33.333 --> 38:35.467
We definitely... we tried
to reach out to your mom,

38:35.502 --> 38:37.565
and we tried time
and time again.

38:37.600 --> 38:41.267
We just hammered down and just
tried to get her to talk to us.

38:41.302 --> 38:43.365
You know, I really
wanted to get a...

38:43.400 --> 38:46.633
I was just desperate to get
a message from her,

38:46.668 --> 38:49.832
something for you,
and it was just really hard

38:49.867 --> 38:53.133
for me to be done investigating
and just not get anything.

38:53.168 --> 38:56.400
I just don't... I want you to
know that we tried really hard.

38:56.435 --> 38:57.684
Oh, that's okay.

38:57.719 --> 38:58.898
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:58.933 --> 39:00.567
Well, one of the first
things that happened to us,

39:00.602 --> 39:02.834
we settled, you know,
in this living room

39:02.869 --> 39:05.218
because we wanted
to figure out the shadow

39:05.253 --> 39:07.532
that you guys see
at the end of the hallway.

39:07.567 --> 39:11.233
My personal experience, I saw
what appeared to be something

39:11.268 --> 39:13.165
that blocked out
the doorframe.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.032
So we were staring down
at the hallway,

39:15.067 --> 39:16.800
and all of a sudden
this thing was like bloop

39:16.835 --> 39:18.532
and went away
really quickly.

39:18.567 --> 39:20.233
So we keep going,
and we're like, "Okay."

39:20.268 --> 39:22.167
Well,
maybe something is here."

39:22.202 --> 39:24.067
So this was
in your bedroom.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.100
20 seconds.

39:32.533 --> 39:34.065
- It is Cindy.
- Yeah.

39:34.100 --> 39:39.333
That was we decided to bring
Cindy into the investigation.

39:39.368 --> 39:41.267
What was interesting
was when we brought her

39:41.302 --> 39:43.032
into the investigation,

39:43.067 --> 39:45.032
and that's when
they started talking.

39:45.067 --> 39:48.600
Automatically we assumed,
"Okay, we're probably dealing

39:48.635 --> 39:51.284
with Pat and Steve
at this point."

39:51.319 --> 39:53.898
But Meghan sees
the man's shadow.

39:53.933 --> 39:57.100
Well, we asked Cindy,
and we said, you know,

39:57.135 --> 39:58.698
"How tall was Steve?"

39:58.733 --> 40:01.867
And she said, "Steve was about
exactly Adam's height."

40:01.902 --> 40:03.833
Which is the
shadow height that you guys see.

40:03.868 --> 40:05.367
Yeah. And that's what
Meghan described.

40:05.402 --> 40:07.098
Oh, she did.

40:07.133 --> 40:11.733
And so the next one
is I ask, you know,

40:11.768 --> 40:13.465
"When they move things around,

40:13.500 --> 40:14.867
does that agitate
you a little bit?"

40:14.902 --> 40:16.100
Oh, okay.

40:21.867 --> 40:23.932
Oh, yeah.

40:23.967 --> 40:25.550
- It does.
- Yes.

40:25.585 --> 40:27.098
- It does.
- It does.

40:27.133 --> 40:28.732
- They're just being honest.
- Mm-hmm.

40:28.767 --> 40:31.400
Obviously we know Pat and Steve
are really nice people

40:31.435 --> 40:34.632
from everything
we've heard about them,

40:34.667 --> 40:37.600
but I could see them
getting a little nervous

40:37.635 --> 40:40.498
when you start really
changing the house around.

40:40.533 --> 40:43.133
I mean, we see it all the time
when construction happens

40:43.168 --> 40:45.084
or when people
change the scenery

40:45.119 --> 40:46.759
or put walls
where doors were,

40:46.794 --> 40:48.365
that the activity picks up.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.467
It's not necessarily a bad
thing, it's just,

40:50.502 --> 40:52.567
you know, it does...
It confuses them.

40:52.602 --> 40:54.633
- Right.
- It's something that occurs.

40:54.668 --> 40:56.498
I'm going to play
this for you.

40:56.533 --> 40:58.100
They were talking
about the collage.

40:58.135 --> 40:59.132
- The board?
- Yeah.

40:59.167 --> 41:01.633
And he asks,
"Are you concerned that

41:01.668 --> 41:02.900
they're going to destroy this?"

41:09.333 --> 41:11.567
- No way.
- No way.

41:11.602 --> 41:12.765
No way.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.800
Which speaks volumes
to the level of confidence

41:14.835 --> 41:16.198
that they have in you guys.

41:16.233 --> 41:19.898
I mean,
you can hang it back up.

41:19.933 --> 41:21.098
You can do whatever
you want with it.

41:21.133 --> 41:22.267
Obviously you're not
going to get rid of it.

41:22.302 --> 41:25.400
And, I mean, I think
that they know

41:25.435 --> 41:26.500
that you would
never do that.

41:26.535 --> 41:27.665
- Yes.
- You know?

41:27.700 --> 41:30.265
It also confirms that,
you know, even though

41:30.300 --> 41:34.198
they might get a little confused
by the renovations,

41:34.233 --> 41:36.950
that they're not concerned that
you're going to do something

41:36.985 --> 41:39.667
that is going to totally
affect them in a way, you know?

41:39.702 --> 41:41.184
Well,
that's good to know.

41:41.219 --> 41:42.632
I mean,
I think we agree.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.800
We just don't think they want
to go anywhere, you know?

41:44.835 --> 41:46.933
This was... they enjoy it here.
This is their home.

41:46.968 --> 41:48.098
Right.

41:48.133 --> 41:49.400
They're just happy here,
like you're happy here.

41:49.435 --> 41:51.633
- And I want them to be happy.
- Yeah.

41:51.668 --> 41:53.365
In every sense
of the word,

41:53.400 --> 41:55.067
we got a welcoming feeling
from them.

41:55.102 --> 41:58.365
- You did?
- I mean, yes.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.500
There's, like, the moment
where you're like,

41:59.535 --> 42:00.734
"Oh, I think somebody
is watching me,"

42:00.769 --> 42:02.434
and that can always
make you uneasy,

42:02.469 --> 42:04.018
but really when think
about who it is,

42:04.053 --> 42:05.532
it's, like, they're just
checking on you.

42:05.567 --> 42:08.400
I think there was some concern
that maybe it would escalate,

42:08.435 --> 42:10.267
especially with the more work
you do in the house

42:10.302 --> 42:11.665
and everything, and it could,

42:11.700 --> 42:13.165
but I think now
that you know who it is,

42:13.200 --> 42:15.433
now you can just call out to
them by name, talk to them...

42:15.468 --> 42:16.865
Right. Right.

42:16.900 --> 42:18.467
...let them know what you're
going to before you do it.

42:18.502 --> 42:19.432
Well, I'm glad that...

42:19.467 --> 42:20.833
It's glad to finally know
who it is.

42:20.868 --> 42:22.867
- Awesome.
- Thank you guys so much.

42:22.902 --> 42:24.832
- Great.
- It's so relieving to know

42:24.867 --> 42:27.100
they're okay with us here.
It is pretty cool.

42:27.135 --> 42:29.333
This is just one of
those cases that, really.

42:29.368 --> 42:30.932
It does have a happy ending.

42:30.967 --> 42:34.067
Holly didn't get a direct
message from her mom,

42:34.102 --> 42:36.798
but she was still given
a sense of peace.

42:36.833 --> 42:39.800
There is a lot of love here,
and the fact that they can make.

42:39.835 --> 42:42.667
Pat and Steve still feel
this welcome in their home

42:42.702 --> 42:44.798
even after they've passed away,

42:44.833 --> 42:47.333
I think too often people want
to get rid of their ghosts,

42:47.368 --> 42:49.833
but once you realize they're
here for the same reasons

42:49.868 --> 42:51.517
you are, you know,
it's amazing.

42:51.552 --> 42:53.167
You don't see that very often.
