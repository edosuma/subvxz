[knock at door]

38:36.444 --> 38:37.837
Waiting for a call?

38:37.880 --> 38:39.752
Uh, something like that.

38:39.795 --> 38:41.449
How can I help?

38:41.493 --> 38:44.409
Oh, yeah, uh, I just popped
by because I wanted to tell you

38:44.452 --> 38:48.456
that today was quite possibly
the most mortifying day

38:48.500 --> 38:50.676
of the last 40 years
of my life.

38:50.719 --> 38:52.504
Heard that from some
of the other department heads.

38:52.547 --> 38:54.636
Yeah, yeah, I bet you did.

38:54.680 --> 38:55.811
Yeah, I can't speak for them.

38:55.855 --> 38:57.378
I can only speak
from my experience.

38:57.422 --> 39:00.860
But, uh, your little experiment
felt embarrassing.

39:00.903 --> 39:03.515
It was humiliating.
It was painfully awkward,

39:03.558 --> 39:07.083
and I can't begin
to thank you enough.

39:07.127 --> 39:10.348
Y--sorry, really?

39:10.391 --> 39:12.132
Yeah, really.

39:12.175 --> 39:16.484
Thanks to you, I was, uh,
I was forced to look inward,

39:16.528 --> 39:19.357
and I had a breakthrough.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.880
- You did?
- I did--

39:20.923 --> 39:22.664
one that I needed more than
I could've ever have known.

39:22.708 --> 39:24.318
- There you go!
- Yeah.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.103
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I am off to have consensual sex

39:27.147 --> 39:28.366
with a stranger of my choosing.

39:28.409 --> 39:30.803
Uh, I think that's great.

39:30.846 --> 39:32.282
Heal thyself, Max.

39:32.326 --> 39:34.023
Heal thyself.

39:39.202 --> 39:41.379
