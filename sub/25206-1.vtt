00:55.841 --> 00:57.840
<b>Resync of explosiveskull's</b>

00:57.841 --> 00:59.708
I have this reoccurring dream.

01:00.942 --> 01:03.507
I'm a little
girl sitting with my mom,

01:03.508 --> 01:06.540
and she's singing to me.

01:06.541 --> 01:09.507
I feel the warmth
of the sun on my skin

01:09.508 --> 01:11.276
and the comfort of her arms
around me.

01:12.607 --> 01:14.808
And I wanna stay there.

01:15.675 --> 01:17.607
Forever.

01:17.608 --> 01:21.208
When I wake up,
I miss the dream.

01:21.209 --> 01:24.008
I want so badly
for this dream to be real,

01:24.009 --> 01:26.674
but that would be impossible

01:26.675 --> 01:29.773
because my mom died
when I was really little.

01:29.774 --> 01:31.741
And I can't go out in the sun.

01:31.742 --> 01:33.441
Like, at all.

01:33.442 --> 01:37.873
I have a rare genetic condition
called Xeroderma Pigmentosum,

01:37.874 --> 01:41.473
or XP, which basically means

01:41.474 --> 01:43.640
a severe sensitivity
to sunlight.

01:43.641 --> 01:46.141
If the sun hits my skin,
I get skin cancer,

01:46.142 --> 01:48.908
my brain starts to fail
and I could die.

01:49.474 --> 01:51.207
Pretty fun, right?

01:51.208 --> 01:55.073
So, I spend all my time indoors
behind special windows,

01:55.074 --> 01:59.074
hanging out with my dad
who is the best dad ever.

01:59.075 --> 02:01.207
Thank goodness,
because growing up,

02:01.208 --> 02:04.073
kids were, what you'd expect.

02:04.074 --> 02:06.175
- No way.
- Yep, a vampire.

02:06.176 --> 02:08.074
That's why they have
special windows.

02:08.074 --> 02:10.174
Don't worry. She can't
get us during the day.

02:10.175 --> 02:13.973
But at night,
stay far, far away.

02:13.974 --> 02:16.075
But not everyone
was afraid of me.

02:18.541 --> 02:20.808
- Hey, Morgan.
- What's wrong with her?

02:23.742 --> 02:26.774
She has something called XP.

02:26.775 --> 02:31.342
Basically, the light from
the sun, it-it hurts her.

02:32.608 --> 02:34.908
So she can't ever go in the sun.

02:34.909 --> 02:37.175
I can't be in the sun
for too long either.

02:37.176 --> 02:39.673
Can she play at night?

02:39.674 --> 02:41.675
- Yeah, but...
- See you tonight.

02:42.508 --> 02:44.641
And I like pizza!

02:44.642 --> 02:46.673
From that point on,

02:46.674 --> 02:49.108
it was me, Morgan and my dad.

02:49.109 --> 02:53.107
Until one day, I saw Charlie.

02:53.108 --> 02:55.441
And that was it.

02:55.442 --> 02:58.141
I was completely,
totally, utterly hooked.

02:58.142 --> 03:00.206
Stupid tree.

03:00.207 --> 03:02.041
I saw him every day.

03:02.042 --> 03:04.943
And yet,
he had no idea I even existed.

03:06.442 --> 03:08.440
Over time,
watching Charlie go by

03:08.441 --> 03:10.275
just became
a part of my routine.

03:11.842 --> 03:13.976
Along with constant
doctor appointments.

03:15.507 --> 03:17.941
Sleeping during the day
and staying up all night,

03:17.942 --> 03:20.641
which, from what I've heard,

03:20.642 --> 03:22.641
is the schedule
of most teenagers.

03:22.642 --> 03:26.673
And playing music
every chance I get.

03:26.674 --> 03:29.674
All things considered,
I've got a pretty great life.

03:29.675 --> 03:32.140
But I still hold onto my dreams.

03:32.141 --> 03:34.606
Stupid tree.

03:34.607 --> 03:36.774
No matter
how impossible they may seem.

03:36.775 --> 03:38.073
"They're not gonna break us"

03:38.074 --> 03:40.506
"Hey, we'll burn so bright"

03:40.507 --> 03:42.807
"Making all the people
Come to life"

03:42.808 --> 03:45.207
"Hey, the darkest sky"

03:45.208 --> 03:47.141
"Can't stop me and you Tonight"

03:47.142 --> 03:50.041
"I said hey
We'll burn so bright"

03:50.042 --> 03:52.474
"Dancing underneath
The city lights"

03:52.475 --> 03:54.807
"Hey, from way up high"

03:54.808 --> 03:56.975
"Shining down
Like stars tonight"

04:02.475 --> 04:03.972
Jeremy Pierce.

04:05.607 --> 04:07.007
Kendall Porter.

04:07.008 --> 04:08.140
Congratulations.

04:08.141 --> 04:09.676
Peter Rathbard.

04:11.140 --> 04:13.640
- Charles Reed.
- Yeah, Charlie!

04:14.608 --> 04:16.243
Congratulations, Charlie.

04:17.175 --> 04:18.942
Katie Price!

04:22.841 --> 04:23.908
What are you wearing?

04:23.909 --> 04:26.874
Cap and gown.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.676
The faculty and staff
always wear one.

04:29.475 --> 04:30.773
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

04:32.542 --> 04:34.541
Most importantly,
this is for you.

04:36.075 --> 04:39.675
I assume, as valedictorian,
you have a speech prepared. Yes?

04:40.207 --> 04:44.173
Um, yes.

04:44.174 --> 04:45.641
That's me putting on my glasses.

04:45.642 --> 04:47.106
- I like that. Nice touch.
- Thank you.

04:47.107 --> 04:50.540
Um, first, I would
like to thank my headmaster.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.673
- Well, I mean...
- My Spanish teacher.

04:52.674 --> 04:54.008
De nada.

04:54.009 --> 04:56.841
- My English teacher.
- It was my pleasure.

04:56.842 --> 04:58.707
But I really wanna
state for the record

04:58.708 --> 05:02.074
that my gym teacher had absolutely
no idea what he was doing...

05:02.075 --> 05:05.808
What? You suck.
I lift weights.

05:05.809 --> 05:07.176
Hey, this is for you.

05:12.008 --> 05:14.706
This is one of the lamest things
I've ever seen.

05:14.707 --> 05:16.607
Yes!

05:16.608 --> 05:18.841
I had to go to three stores
to find something this lame.

05:18.842 --> 05:21.072
- I mean, it's horrific.
- Yeah! It's the worst.

05:21.073 --> 05:22.140
Yeah.

05:22.141 --> 05:23.841
All right.

05:23.842 --> 05:25.841
Are you ready for your present?

05:25.842 --> 05:27.741
- There's a present involved?
- There's a present, yes!

05:27.742 --> 05:29.474
Of course, there's a present.
It's graduation...

05:29.475 --> 05:31.115
This just keeps getting
better and better.

05:41.774 --> 05:43.208
This is Mom's.

05:53.809 --> 05:55.741
Look, I know it's kind of old,

05:55.742 --> 05:57.673
so if you want a newer one
I totally under...

05:57.674 --> 06:00.208
No, I love it!
Thank you. Thank you so much.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.708
You look just like your mother.

06:10.841 --> 06:12.676
Lucky you.
She was hot.

06:13.475 --> 06:14.641
Ew.

06:14.642 --> 06:17.109
Try and get some sleep.
All right?

06:42.775 --> 06:45.174
I can't believe this is happening.

06:56.542 --> 06:57.709
Ooh.

06:59.008 --> 07:00.473
That's a good one.

07:00.474 --> 07:03.171
Something weird's
going on right here.

07:05.641 --> 07:08.640
Hey, Dad, um...
I was wondering

07:08.641 --> 07:10.573
if I could go play
my new beautiful present

07:10.574 --> 07:11.975
at the train station tonight.

07:14.575 --> 07:16.574
It's 10:00.

07:16.575 --> 07:18.673
Why can't Morgan just come over?
You could play here for me.

07:18.674 --> 07:20.106
Morgan's busy with her family.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.907
And, Dad, I love playing
for you, I really do,

07:22.908 --> 07:25.039
but I also need
to get used to playing

07:25.040 --> 07:27.006
in front of other people too.

07:27.007 --> 07:28.473
Please, please, please.

07:28.474 --> 07:30.640
Fred will be there.
He'll watch out for me.

07:30.641 --> 07:32.140
And I graduated today!

07:32.141 --> 07:35.742
Isn't that the American
tradition, to extend my curfew?

07:38.941 --> 07:41.573
Okay, I'll extend
your curfew one hour.

07:41.574 --> 07:43.773
Which means midnight, okay?

07:43.774 --> 07:45.173
Hey, and text me
right when you get there,

07:45.174 --> 07:46.540
or I'm not just gonna call Fred,

07:46.541 --> 07:47.707
I'm actually
gonna come down there.

07:47.708 --> 07:50.139
And it will be so embarrassing,
it'll become urban legend

07:50.140 --> 07:52.905
- on why kids should stick to their curfew!
- I love you.

08:02.041 --> 08:05.573
"Come to me, baby
Don't be shy, don't be shy"

08:05.574 --> 08:06.640
"Don't be shy"

08:06.641 --> 08:09.574
"Come to me, baby Don't be shy"

08:09.575 --> 08:10.773
Boy.

08:10.774 --> 08:13.573
"It was the summertime"

08:13.574 --> 08:15.207
"Summertime"

08:15.208 --> 08:18.474
Hey, don't do that thing.

08:18.475 --> 08:19.807
What thing?

08:19.808 --> 08:23.440
That. I mean, you look all sad
and it makes me sad.

08:23.441 --> 08:25.072
Please just chug this beer
and come hang out!

08:25.073 --> 08:27.039
Dude, you dodged a bullet, man.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.840
You were gonna be up at the ass
crack of dawn every morning

08:29.841 --> 08:32.440
taking tests,
nowhere near the beach.

08:32.441 --> 08:34.972
And now, we get to do this...
our whole lives.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.573
I forgot,
doing this our whole lives,

08:38.575 --> 08:40.335
it's way better
than a full ride to Berkeley.

08:41.039 --> 08:43.207
Zoe Carmichael. 3:00.

08:45.775 --> 08:49.173
- Charlie... you're in trouble.
- What did I do this time?

08:49.174 --> 08:50.740
You didn't get me a drink.

08:50.741 --> 08:52.541
I did not know you were thirsty.

08:52.542 --> 08:53.808
Now you do.

08:55.641 --> 08:57.575
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

08:58.141 --> 08:59.576
Is that the bad one?

09:00.607 --> 09:02.707
Well, now that
you're not swimming,

09:02.708 --> 09:06.139
maybe you'll have
a little extra time for me.

09:06.140 --> 09:07.939
I also have some
extra time for you.

09:07.940 --> 09:09.873
- And I'm not swimming.
- You were never swimming, idiot.

09:09.874 --> 09:11.541
Zoe! Get over here, bitch!

09:11.542 --> 09:13.207
Hold on!

09:13.208 --> 09:14.840
You're coming to
my graduation party, right?

09:14.841 --> 09:16.107
Yeah, I think so.

09:16.108 --> 09:17.241
Good.

09:18.208 --> 09:20.008
Yeah!

09:22.040 --> 09:23.908
What... What are you doing?

09:24.674 --> 09:26.007
Dodging another bullet.

09:26.008 --> 09:28.506
Come on, dude.
It's our graduation night.

09:28.507 --> 09:29.708
I'm not feeling it, boys.

09:30.441 --> 09:31.808
I'll see you later.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.675
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

09:39.107 --> 09:40.541
Hey, yo, Fred.

09:40.542 --> 09:41.872
I was wondering if I was
gonna see you tonight.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.338
What, and disappoint
all my fans?

10:05.041 --> 10:06.940
"While you're fast asleep"

10:06.941 --> 10:08.206
"Counting your sheep"

10:08.207 --> 10:10.074
"I'm breathin'"

10:14.008 --> 10:15.773
"I'll be up all night"

10:15.774 --> 10:18.342
"Playing through
This twilight dream"

10:22.607 --> 10:23.973
"'Cause all my life"

10:23.974 --> 10:27.007
"I have been Patiently waiting"

10:31.475 --> 10:36.206
"For lights to dim
To fulfill my destiny"

10:38.041 --> 10:40.974
"I'll keep reaching"

10:42.807 --> 10:47.206
"As far as I can
Till break of day"

10:47.207 --> 10:49.741
"I'll keep reaching"

10:51.674 --> 10:55.940
"The light of my life
Will find its way"

10:55.941 --> 10:58.807
"I know if I reach too far"

10:58.808 --> 11:02.075
"I may not ever recover"

11:05.073 --> 11:07.607
"But I know the stars"

11:07.608 --> 11:10.975
"Ain't all I'm meant
To discover"

11:12.907 --> 11:15.741
"So I'll keep reaching"

11:21.773 --> 11:24.973
"I know if I reach too far"

11:24.974 --> 11:28.676
"I may not ever recover"

11:31.141 --> 11:33.907
"But I know the stars"

11:33.908 --> 11:37.741
"Ain't all
I'm meant to discover"

11:39.073 --> 11:41.174
"So I'll keep rea..."

11:41.774 --> 11:43.075
Hey.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.573
I didn't mean to freak you out.

11:51.574 --> 11:52.808
Here.

11:54.807 --> 11:57.441
Me? I'm not freaked out.
Don't worry about it.

11:57.442 --> 11:59.073
- Here, I'll help you.
- I'm not a freak.

11:59.074 --> 12:01.506
Why are you packing up?
Where are you going?

12:01.507 --> 12:03.507
Um, home.
I gotta go home.

12:03.508 --> 12:05.808
Home? Wait, you live here?

12:06.808 --> 12:08.139
Wait, you didn't
go to Purdue High.

12:08.140 --> 12:10.473
No. It's a very
different school.

12:10.474 --> 12:13.906
And I graduated today and
my dad's a super big worrier.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.241
So, I really gotta...
God.

12:20.940 --> 12:23.739
- Um...
- I have to go.

12:23.740 --> 12:26.241
Wait! Wait! What...
I'm sorry, why are you...

12:27.542 --> 12:28.507
What's the rush? What...

12:28.508 --> 12:31.474
Um, I have to get home
to my cat.

12:31.475 --> 12:34.207
- Your cat.
- Yeah, it died.

12:36.706 --> 12:39.207
So, you're not
in a rush then, right?

12:39.208 --> 12:41.940
No, no, I am.
I have to plan the funeral

12:41.941 --> 12:45.540
for my, um, dead cat that died.

12:45.541 --> 12:47.274
Yeah, it's super dead.

12:50.007 --> 12:51.676
Wait! Wait! Wait!

12:53.007 --> 12:54.241
I didn't even get your name!

13:11.074 --> 13:14.207
You haven't noticed any changes in
her? Motor functions still seem strong?

13:14.208 --> 13:16.872
Yeah. Yeah, no loss
of intellectual function,

13:16.873 --> 13:20.007
no difficulty swallowing
or talking.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.973
Believe me on that.

13:21.974 --> 13:25.541
And no corneal ulcerations.

13:25.542 --> 13:29.342
Really, there's nothing to
suggest any neurodegeneration.

13:30.574 --> 13:31.972
Any exposure to sunlight?

13:31.973 --> 13:33.907
No, of course not.

13:35.108 --> 13:37.140
I'm gonna refill her
prescription for you this time,

13:37.141 --> 13:39.642
but she really should be coming
to these appointments with you.

13:40.508 --> 13:42.639
Yeah, well, you know teenagers.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.000
They get embarrassed
by their dads.

13:45.141 --> 13:48.173
- She has XP, Jack.
- I know exactly what she has.

13:48.174 --> 13:49.705
It's not gonna
fall into remission.

13:49.706 --> 13:52.140
And every year, the risk
becomes more serious for her.

13:52.141 --> 13:54.507
So, if she's exposed to even
the slightest bit of sunlight...

13:54.508 --> 13:56.840
She won't be.

13:56.841 --> 13:59.675
- She's reached that age we talked about.
- She won't be.

14:02.941 --> 14:05.839
Any word on the University
of Washington study?

14:05.840 --> 14:09.939
I submitted Katie's name for their Phase
Two trials, if it even gets that far.

14:09.940 --> 14:12.072
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

14:12.073 --> 14:13.940
Research funding
being what it is,

14:13.941 --> 14:16.941
we're talking about a disease that
affects only one in a million people.

14:19.973 --> 14:22.941
We're in luck,
'cause she is one in a million.

14:26.640 --> 14:29.208
A cat funeral?

14:30.074 --> 14:31.840
Please stop saying it out loud.

14:31.841 --> 14:34.473
No, I mean,
I've heard that dead pets

14:34.474 --> 14:35.940
can actually be an aphrodisiac.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.440
Morgan, what should I have said?

14:38.441 --> 14:40.873
Any other combination of words
in the English language.

14:40.874 --> 14:42.839
Like, "Hey, I'm Katie Price."

14:42.840 --> 14:45.006
I've watched you outside
my window for the past 10 years,

14:45.007 --> 14:48.107
"and I've been in love with you,
stalking you every minute of the day."

14:48.108 --> 14:51.705
- Okay, don't start with that...
- Or how about, "Hey, you may remember me from kindergarten,"

14:51.706 --> 14:53.174
when everyone
called me a vampire."

14:53.175 --> 14:55.072
No one remembers that!

14:55.073 --> 14:58.140
- What did I do?
- It's bad, but we'll fix it.

14:58.141 --> 15:01.640
I feel so stupid and lame.

15:01.641 --> 15:03.342
Well, at least
you have M&M's. So...

15:05.974 --> 15:07.208
Thanks.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.007
So, you've just gotta
make up for it next time.

15:12.008 --> 15:13.639
There's not gonna be
a next time.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.675
- You don't know that.
- I do.

15:16.807 --> 15:18.873
This is good.
This is what Taylor Swift does.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.573
She has awkward
interactions with boys,

15:20.574 --> 15:23.940
and then she just writes
amazing songs about it. What?

15:23.941 --> 15:26.140
No, no.

15:26.141 --> 15:28.907
- Come on.
- What's happening?

15:28.908 --> 15:30.173
Did you see my notebook
when you came in?

15:30.174 --> 15:32.505
Your notebook notebook? No.

15:32.506 --> 15:33.972
I think I left it
at the train station.

15:33.973 --> 15:36.772
- God.
- Can you please go get it for me?

15:36.773 --> 15:38.940
Morgan, it's so important.
Please.

15:38.941 --> 15:41.606
You know, I would,
but there's, like,

15:41.607 --> 15:44.075
a few other poppin' cat funerals
that I was gonna hit today.

15:44.874 --> 15:46.975
No, no! I'm in a corner!!

15:57.174 --> 15:58.940
Hey.

15:58.941 --> 16:00.207
My friend's
been looking for that.

16:00.208 --> 16:01.941
You know her? Wait.

16:03.073 --> 16:05.040
Morgan, right?
We had English class together.

16:05.041 --> 16:08.639
- I'm Charlie...
- Charlie Reed, yeah. I know.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.006
And it was a history class.

16:10.007 --> 16:11.207
But how do you know her?

16:11.208 --> 16:13.007
- Did she just move here?
- Notebook first.

16:13.008 --> 16:16.708
Or you could just tell me where she
lives and I could drop it off.

16:17.908 --> 16:19.174
I have a better idea.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.539
Hey, Dad, I need to go to the train
station to pick up my notebook.

16:26.540 --> 16:27.806
Fred has it.

16:27.807 --> 16:29.975
Okay, text me when you get there
and be careful.

16:38.674 --> 16:39.807
Fred?

16:44.108 --> 16:46.605
Holy pregnant cow.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.740
My God.
My God.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.006
My God.

16:50.007 --> 16:51.640
Thank you.

16:55.540 --> 16:56.705
Purdue Creamery.

16:56.706 --> 16:59.773
- Morgan.
- Hey. How's your second date?

16:59.774 --> 17:01.206
How could you do this to me?

17:01.207 --> 17:02.540
My God, I'm in sweatpants.

17:02.541 --> 17:05.638
My hair, it's-it's a mess.
It's tied.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.473
My God, I look like an idiot.

17:07.473 --> 17:10.440
Please. Katie,
you're super freakin' hot, okay?

17:10.441 --> 17:12.705
I can't even see you right now and
I can tell you look gorgeous.

17:12.707 --> 17:14.071
Hi, excuse me.
Can I just get a large...

17:14.073 --> 17:15.906
Can you not see
I'm on the phone?

17:17.772 --> 17:20.106
He really likes you, okay?
I can tell.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.839
Just try to be yourself.
Don't ramble too much.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.306
And call me afterwards.

17:25.973 --> 17:27.107
Bye.

17:32.606 --> 17:34.807
My...

17:46.108 --> 17:48.007
You exist.

17:48.008 --> 17:50.672
I thought I was dreaming
last night or something.

17:50.673 --> 17:53.505
Were you in the REM
stage of sleep?

17:53.506 --> 17:54.639
What?

17:54.640 --> 17:57.139
That's when most
dreams happen, actually.

17:57.140 --> 18:00.506
Yeah, your brain activity
is super high and functioning,

18:00.507 --> 18:03.639
and your eyes are just going
nuts behind your eyelids.

18:03.640 --> 18:07.140
It looks super weird. It's like
a typewriter or something.

18:07.141 --> 18:09.806
Um, anyway, thank you for...

18:09.807 --> 18:12.072
Wait, I, I still
don't know your name.

18:14.140 --> 18:16.738
- It's Katie.
- Katie, I'm Charlie.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.039
That's a weird name.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.973
Thank God you told me it 'cause I
wouldn't have known it otherwise.

18:22.974 --> 18:24.807
Thank you.

18:24.808 --> 18:26.575
- Wait, what...
- You didn't...

18:29.208 --> 18:31.840
You didn't read through it,
did you?

18:31.841 --> 18:33.540
Just a little. I...

18:33.541 --> 18:34.740
- What?
- What?

18:34.741 --> 18:36.705
Are you serious?
You read through my journal?

18:36.706 --> 18:38.539
- Look, I...
- This could have been a diary.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.140
I mean, it is, kind of.

18:40.141 --> 18:42.072
Um, I'm... I'm really sorry.

18:42.073 --> 18:44.072
You left really quick
the other night,

18:44.073 --> 18:45.673
and I really had no idea
who it belonged to,

18:45.674 --> 18:47.073
so I just
looked through it quickly.

18:47.074 --> 18:49.173
But I like that you
still handwrite things.

18:49.174 --> 18:51.274
It's... It's cool.
It's old school.

18:54.008 --> 18:56.173
Thanks... for finding it.

18:56.174 --> 18:57.342
Yeah.

18:59.541 --> 19:00.973
Wait!

19:00.974 --> 19:02.572
What, another cat died?
You have to...

19:03.674 --> 19:05.739
Um...

19:05.740 --> 19:10.006
I... I had to... I... I'm...
I'm walking home.

19:10.007 --> 19:11.207
Can I walk with you?

19:13.140 --> 19:15.106
Um, yeah.

19:15.107 --> 19:18.439
So, you were home-schooled?
Man, that must have been wild.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.206
Actually, it was the exact
opposite of wild.

19:21.207 --> 19:23.440
My dad's pretty protective.

19:23.441 --> 19:26.573
He's not, like, watching us
right now, is he?

19:26.574 --> 19:29.872
Yeah. He has his phone
tapped into every camera.

19:32.473 --> 19:36.206
So, um, what did you think
of the songs you read?

19:36.207 --> 19:39.505
Without my permission,
I may add.

19:39.506 --> 19:42.008
Um, honestly, I don't know.

19:43.107 --> 19:44.873
I mean, you can't really
read a song, right?

19:44.874 --> 19:46.173
True.

19:46.174 --> 19:48.907
I guess I'd have
to hear you sing them.

19:48.908 --> 19:51.906
Um, so anyway,
I'm right up here.

19:51.907 --> 19:53.974
So, you don't have to walk me.

19:55.473 --> 19:57.639
Wait, you live up there?

19:57.640 --> 19:59.205
I-I don't understand
how we've never met.

19:59.206 --> 20:00.705
I've probably
skated by your house,

20:00.706 --> 20:02.039
like, every day
on the way to practice.

20:02.040 --> 20:06.272
It's a... funny coincidence.

20:08.706 --> 20:09.942
Um...

20:11.041 --> 20:12.174
thanks.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.974
Hey, you wouldn't wanna do
something sometime, would you?

20:19.541 --> 20:21.506
Um... together?

20:21.507 --> 20:24.342
Yes, us together.
Hanging out.

20:25.574 --> 20:29.207
Um... I'm really busy
during the day.

20:31.040 --> 20:34.342
But... I could be free at night.

20:35.573 --> 20:37.072
I could be free at night.

20:37.073 --> 20:40.340
Well, you should
put your number in here then.

20:43.473 --> 20:45.540
I'm old school too.

20:45.541 --> 20:46.907
Smooth.

20:47.773 --> 20:49.207
Thank you.

20:53.673 --> 20:56.640
That is so romantic
it disgusts me.

20:58.139 --> 20:59.639
What did he say about your XP?

20:59.640 --> 21:01.672
It didn't come up.

21:01.673 --> 21:03.473
What do you mean,
it didn't come up?

21:03.474 --> 21:05.540
I-I didn't bring it up.

21:05.541 --> 21:07.473
I'm not gonna just
randomly be like,

21:07.474 --> 21:10.938
"Hey, dude, by the way,
the sunlight's gonna..."

21:11.973 --> 21:15.205
Like, look when you
tell someone you're sick,

21:15.206 --> 21:19.940
then you start to become more like
a disease and less like a person.

21:19.941 --> 21:22.539
It's... I'm gonna tell him,
I promise,

21:22.540 --> 21:24.673
but I don't know
when I'm gonna see him again.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.639
I do.

21:26.640 --> 21:28.972
You know that annoying guy who works
with me at the ice cream shop?

21:28.973 --> 21:32.007
- The nerdy one you hate?
- Yes, Garver.

21:32.008 --> 21:34.807
His parents are out of town tonight
and he's throwing a party.

21:34.808 --> 21:36.639
And he told me to bring friends.

21:36.640 --> 21:39.073
- So, I'm gonna bring you...
- No, no, no, no, no...

21:39.074 --> 21:41.640
- And you're gonna bring Charlie.
- No.

21:41.641 --> 21:44.473
He's gotta, like, you know...

21:44.474 --> 21:47.873
Doesn't... I have to wait
till he texts me first, right?

21:47.874 --> 21:49.706
Yeah, totally.

21:49.707 --> 21:52.439
And then, you know, his squire will
send a note via carrier pigeon

21:52.440 --> 21:53.973
asking if you'd like
to merge your kingdoms.

21:53.974 --> 21:55.973
What is this,
18th-century England?

21:55.974 --> 21:57.772
You're a hot,
young, badass woman.

21:57.773 --> 22:00.174
You're gonna text him
whenever you damn well please.

22:01.740 --> 22:03.107
Be confident, okay?

22:03.908 --> 22:05.840
- Give him the facts.
- Okay.

22:15.941 --> 22:18.671
- Play a little hard to get.
- All right.

22:21.573 --> 22:23.907
Make sure that he knows he's not
the only reason you're going.

22:23.908 --> 22:25.506
Okay.

22:25.507 --> 22:26.908
All right.

22:28.941 --> 22:30.237
No.

22:38.606 --> 22:41.071
This is gonna be a tame,
safe, parent-friendly party.

22:41.072 --> 22:42.973
Ha!
It's a totally lame party.

22:42.974 --> 22:44.940
You know what we should do?
We should stay here.

22:44.941 --> 22:48.038
We'll get Hunan Chinese.
You guys love Hunan, right?

22:48.039 --> 22:49.740
Put some Netflix on.
It'll be perfect.

22:51.107 --> 22:53.138
Dad, you know I'm a good kid.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.940
You know I'm not gonna
do anything crazy.

22:54.941 --> 22:57.605
But I swear,
if I spend one more night here,

22:57.606 --> 23:00.071
just listening to everyone else
outside my window

23:00.072 --> 23:03.273
living their lives,
I might go crazy.

23:05.874 --> 23:10.075
Tomorrow night, we can order way too much
chow mein, and have a movie marathon.

23:14.206 --> 23:16.672
- All right.
- Yes, thank you!

23:16.673 --> 23:18.573
You're the best dad
in the world.

23:18.574 --> 23:20.505
Thanks, Mr. P!

23:20.506 --> 23:24.440
Okay, um, Charlie's gonna
meet us at Garver's at 8:00.

23:24.441 --> 23:25.672
We have to get ready!

23:25.673 --> 23:26.872
Dude, what are you
talking about?

23:26.873 --> 23:28.975
We have, like, three hours.

23:29.740 --> 23:31.273
We're already behind.

23:33.206 --> 23:34.240
Done.

23:36.106 --> 23:41.574
Mr. P! May I present
Katherine Price of Washington.

23:54.840 --> 23:58.872
Peanut... you look amazing.

23:58.873 --> 24:00.606
"I'll drink your wine"

24:00.607 --> 24:02.971
Bye, Mr. P!

24:02.972 --> 24:06.038
"I'll spin your clocks
And I'll gut your fish"

24:06.039 --> 24:09.606
"I'll fuck you blind
And make a run for it"

24:09.607 --> 24:10.841
Let's go.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.942
God, I can't believe
Garver's throwing a kegger.

24:22.773 --> 24:24.170
You came.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.773
Is there any chance that you,
or your hot friend, hey,

24:27.774 --> 24:31.605
know how to get beer
out of a keg?

24:31.606 --> 24:33.840
No.

24:33.841 --> 24:37.505
- You didn't get a tap?
- I didn't realize they were separate things.

24:37.506 --> 24:40.205
Why would they sell me a barrel
of beer I can't even access?

24:50.139 --> 24:52.539
Garver! What the hell?

24:52.540 --> 24:55.606
This is a tame, safe,
parent-friendly party!

24:55.607 --> 24:58.107
Do tame parties
have sundae bars?

24:59.507 --> 25:01.105
I think it's so cool.

25:01.106 --> 25:02.773
No, don't listen to her.

25:02.774 --> 25:04.206
Okay, she's never been
to a party before.

25:04.207 --> 25:06.639
She doesn't understand
how dire the situation is.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.106
- We gotta go.
- What, you're leaving?

25:08.107 --> 25:10.172
No, no, no. I just made
a huge thing of chili.

25:10.173 --> 25:12.405
Garver,
chili is not a party food.

25:13.673 --> 25:16.007
You see, the party's
just kicking off.

25:20.073 --> 25:22.006
What's Charlie Reed doing here?

25:22.007 --> 25:23.206
My God.

25:33.140 --> 25:34.340
Hi.

25:39.873 --> 25:41.207
You look really amazing.

25:42.939 --> 25:45.942
Um... it's all Morgan.

25:46.839 --> 25:48.539
No, I don't think so.

25:48.540 --> 25:50.706
For you, good sir.

25:50.707 --> 25:52.074
Thank you.

25:52.973 --> 25:54.205
Thank you.

25:54.206 --> 25:55.340
Beef chili?

25:57.972 --> 26:02.473
That's top shelf, buddy.
That's fresh.

26:02.474 --> 26:05.572
You know, I really thought we'd
have a bigger turnout, but...

26:05.573 --> 26:07.539
I told you not to go
up against a cheerleader.

26:07.540 --> 26:09.206
What cheerleader?

26:09.207 --> 26:11.505
It's the mean blonde one
with a convertible.

26:11.506 --> 26:12.771
- Zoe Carmichael?
- Yes.

26:13.674 --> 26:15.505
She's having a party
tonight as well.

26:15.506 --> 26:17.605
Must have dinged our turnout.

26:17.606 --> 26:18.838
Do you guys wanna go there?

26:18.839 --> 26:21.038
Well, I like the idea.

26:22.573 --> 26:26.640
- Hey.
- I was wondering where you were.

26:26.641 --> 26:28.739
- Who are these people?
- These are my friends.

26:28.740 --> 26:31.206
And they brought you a keg.

26:35.007 --> 26:37.639
Great. Come on in.

26:50.740 --> 26:53.840
Charlie!

26:55.807 --> 26:57.074
Hey, what's up, man?

27:03.940 --> 27:05.174
You good?

27:06.207 --> 27:08.972
Hey, I'm gonna
go take a lap upstairs.

27:08.973 --> 27:10.074
Away from you two.

27:12.973 --> 27:14.071
Thank you.

27:14.072 --> 27:16.206
Your friend Morgan,
she seems cool.

27:17.207 --> 27:18.871
Yeah. She's really cool.

27:19.973 --> 27:21.806
How long have you guys
known each other?

27:21.807 --> 27:23.740
I don't know. Like, forever.

27:25.972 --> 27:27.805
He's back.

27:27.806 --> 27:29.439
Charlie!

27:29.440 --> 27:32.138
Who is this?

27:32.139 --> 27:36.139
Owen, Wes, this is Katie Price.

27:36.140 --> 27:37.439
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.439
Katie, you're... you're...

27:39.440 --> 27:42.673
- Um...-
- You got Charlie to come to a party,

27:42.674 --> 27:44.605
and make a smile-like feature.

27:44.606 --> 27:47.573
Our boy hasn't looked
this good in a long time.

27:47.574 --> 27:49.073
There you are.

27:51.873 --> 27:53.673
I'm still thirsty.

27:53.674 --> 27:55.105
Wanna get me that drink now?

27:55.106 --> 27:59.173
I'm actually about to go take
Katie on the house party tour.

27:59.174 --> 28:00.972
So. You ready?

28:00.973 --> 28:02.506
"Tonight, we are victorious"

28:02.507 --> 28:04.705
- We'll be right back.
- Nice meeting you guys.

28:04.706 --> 28:06.226
- Nice to meet you, Katie.
- Take care.

28:07.706 --> 28:09.173
- I can quench your thirst.
- Shut up.

28:09.174 --> 28:13.738
"Victorious"

28:18.541 --> 28:23.038
"We gotta Turn up the crazy"

28:23.039 --> 28:27.606
"Livin' like
A washed up celebrity"

28:27.607 --> 28:32.641
"Shooting fireworks
Like it's the Fourth of July"

28:34.972 --> 28:37.540
"Tonight, we are victorious"

28:37.541 --> 28:39.606
"Champagne pouring over us"

28:39.607 --> 28:41.640
Would you like to dance with me?

28:41.641 --> 28:45.206
Garver, what on earth makes you think
I'd ever want to dance with you?

28:45.207 --> 28:47.238
"Until we feel all right"

28:49.673 --> 28:54.006
"Until we feel all right"

28:54.007 --> 28:55.671
You know, if you tell anyone
about this, I'll kill you.

28:55.672 --> 28:56.940
Totally.

29:02.840 --> 29:03.941
Hey, hey!

29:05.040 --> 29:06.704
- Hey.
- Gotta stay hydrated.

29:06.705 --> 29:07.941
Thank you.

29:09.906 --> 29:11.771
This is really interesting.

29:11.772 --> 29:15.240
I don't think
I've ever seen this happen.

29:16.107 --> 29:17.704
Yeah.

29:17.705 --> 29:20.738
Classic high school,
awkward party.

29:21.706 --> 29:23.206
I've only seen it at the movies.

29:23.207 --> 29:25.106
I gotta show you this.
Come on.

29:25.107 --> 29:26.907
- God.
- Come on.

29:28.540 --> 29:30.740
Okay, similar
to what's going on over here.

29:31.605 --> 29:33.173
We just kind of hold here.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.641
And swing the hips awkwardly.

29:39.640 --> 29:41.472
- Am I doing it?
- Yeah, you're kind of.

29:41.473 --> 29:43.273
And then I would slowly back up.

29:50.173 --> 29:53.705
"Forever young, we are"

29:53.706 --> 29:55.871
"Always falling free"

29:55.872 --> 29:58.440
"If tomorrow never comes"

29:58.441 --> 30:00.839
"We will always be
Forever young"

30:00.840 --> 30:04.739
Everybody! This is the best
night of my life! Yeah!

30:11.173 --> 30:12.574
You wanna go someplace else?

30:13.440 --> 30:14.675
Okay.

30:16.572 --> 30:17.872
I-I don't get it.

30:17.873 --> 30:19.671
How could they just
take your scholarship away?

30:19.672 --> 30:22.439
Well, I had to have surgery.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.574
And they didn't think
I could ever swim again.

30:25.906 --> 30:28.639
And no more scholarship
meant no more Berkeley.

30:28.640 --> 30:31.972
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

30:31.973 --> 30:35.039
So, how did you do it?
How did you hurt yourself?

30:35.040 --> 30:37.105
It was just a freak accident.

30:37.106 --> 30:39.106
You know, I fell down
some stairs and...

30:41.006 --> 30:42.906
And that's not true.

30:42.907 --> 30:45.205
That's kind of what
I tell everybody.

30:45.206 --> 30:47.273
I got really drunk one night
at Owen's house.

30:49.739 --> 30:53.640
And my friends dared me to jump
off the roof into the pool...

30:54.873 --> 30:56.807
and I clipped the edge
with my shoulder.

30:59.973 --> 31:01.206
I'm such an idiot.

31:01.207 --> 31:03.074
I don't wanna be that guy,
you know?

31:06.972 --> 31:08.239
Then don't be.

31:10.474 --> 31:12.871
You know, my mom used to take me
here when I was little.

31:12.872 --> 31:17.872
- Really?
- She sat me right there.

31:17.873 --> 31:21.938
And, um, she tried to teach me
how to play the guitar.

31:21.939 --> 31:25.572
Actually, this watch was hers.

31:25.573 --> 31:29.504
I spent so much time looking
at this thing on her hand.

31:29.505 --> 31:31.073
And...

31:33.673 --> 31:37.971
um, she died when I was little.

31:37.972 --> 31:41.173
- She was in a car accident.
- I'm-I'm so sorry.

31:41.174 --> 31:42.704
- You know, we can go someplace...
- No.

31:42.705 --> 31:45.772
No, no. No, no.
No, I'm... I'm good.

31:45.773 --> 31:48.575
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. I promise.

31:51.072 --> 31:52.673
You wanna see something cool?

31:54.839 --> 31:56.471
Ta-da!

31:56.472 --> 31:59.106
- This is yours?
- No.

31:59.107 --> 32:02.006
But it's something I'm taking
care of for the summer.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.139
It's a Jespersen 53.

32:09.440 --> 32:12.905
One of these days we could take
her for a sail around the harbor,

32:12.906 --> 32:14.074
we can watch the sun set.

32:23.739 --> 32:27.006
That sounds perfect.

32:49.906 --> 32:52.771
Um, just, let me get out of...

32:56.107 --> 32:57.341
Sorry.

32:59.174 --> 33:01.038
So, what are
you gonna do this year,

33:01.039 --> 33:02.671
now that you're
not going to Berkeley?

33:02.672 --> 33:05.904
Well, first I'm gonna
get a new truck.

33:07.673 --> 33:10.341
And then I'm gonna
drive across the country.

33:11.873 --> 33:13.906
You know, I've been in
the pool my entire life,

33:13.907 --> 33:16.074
and, I haven't
got to see much else, so...

33:17.673 --> 33:21.872
- Um, what are you gonna do...
- I'm not doing anything.

33:21.873 --> 33:25.906
I'm just gonna take some
online courses, I think.

33:25.907 --> 33:29.838
But I'll just be here.

33:29.839 --> 33:31.806
I, I meant
what are you doing tomorrow?

33:32.672 --> 33:35.571
God.

33:35.572 --> 33:39.340
Um... I...

33:41.506 --> 33:44.072
I'm busy during the day,

33:44.073 --> 33:46.806
but I can be free
tomorrow night.

33:46.807 --> 33:48.107
That's perfect.

33:49.640 --> 33:52.207
- I'll see you tomorrow night?
- Okay.

33:58.906 --> 34:00.673
I have something to tell you.

34:02.739 --> 34:04.839
I don't actually have a cat.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.071
No shit.

34:17.906 --> 34:21.472
- Who are you texting?
- No one.

34:21.473 --> 34:22.971
"What if I..."

34:22.972 --> 34:27.471
- Morgan, who are you texting?
- Garver.

34:28.839 --> 34:31.438
Um, I can't hear you
when you're whispering...

34:31.438 --> 34:32.838
Garver!
I made out with Garver.

34:32.839 --> 34:36.839
No! He's really, really cute.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.905
And he totally likes you.

34:39.906 --> 34:44.505
By the way, can I tell my dad that
I'm going over to yours tonight,

34:44.505 --> 34:46.206
so I can go hang out
with Charlie later?

34:48.206 --> 34:50.105
You're asking me to help you
lie to your father,

34:50.106 --> 34:51.346
so you can hang out with a guy?

34:52.540 --> 34:54.806
I've never been so proud of you!

34:57.439 --> 34:59.539
Dad, I'm gonna
go over to Morgan's tonight.

34:59.540 --> 35:01.738
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, yeah, no problem.

35:01.739 --> 35:03.074
Hey, how was that party?

35:05.972 --> 35:07.605
Party was nice.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.139
Did you meet any fun people?

35:09.140 --> 35:11.605
No. Not really.

35:11.606 --> 35:14.571
Everybody was kind of just,
like, you know?

35:14.572 --> 35:16.739
Nobody was really there.
It was just...

35:16.740 --> 35:19.172
- So I'm gonna...
- skedaddle.

35:19.173 --> 35:21.639
- Love you.
- Love you more.

35:26.439 --> 35:27.705
I'm lying.

35:27.706 --> 35:30.573
Well, you were rambling,
so I kind of figured.

35:37.973 --> 35:40.739
I'm going to go meet a boy
named Charlie Reed,

35:40.740 --> 35:42.938
who's really nice and sweet.

35:42.939 --> 35:47.340
And I really, really
like him... a lot.

35:49.040 --> 35:51.639
- Are you mad?
- I'm not happy that you lied to me.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.639
You know you can
always tell me anything...

35:53.640 --> 35:55.074
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

35:56.505 --> 35:58.139
- Do you trust this guy?
- Yes.

35:58.140 --> 36:01.074
- Will I hate him?
- No. No, you won't. I promise.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.138
- Does he know about your...
- I haven't told him yet.

36:04.139 --> 36:05.538
- No, Katie...
- But I will...

36:05.539 --> 36:07.605
No, I am not comfortable
with him not knowing.

36:07.606 --> 36:12.205
I know, I'm going to. I just
need a little bit longer of...

36:12.206 --> 36:16.073
- What?
- Being someone more than just a disease.

36:18.174 --> 36:21.705
- Katie.
- It's just a few more days, please?

36:21.706 --> 36:23.574
Like a normal girl.

36:24.806 --> 36:27.505
Hey.

36:27.506 --> 36:30.439
Is it okay if me and Katie hang out
tonight together, the entire night?

36:30.440 --> 36:31.905
I already admitted everything.

36:31.906 --> 36:34.072
What, you couldn't
make it two hours?

36:34.073 --> 36:37.107
It's pathetic.
I could've made it two hours.

36:43.539 --> 36:45.605
What does Katie Price wanna do?

36:45.606 --> 36:47.938
There are so
many things I wanna do.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.772
I have always wanted to do this.

36:50.773 --> 36:56.107
"Just blind and drunk
We can never see what's real"

36:57.106 --> 36:59.340
"See what's real"

37:01.606 --> 37:03.538
Ready?

37:04.739 --> 37:06.405
"All kinds of places"

37:06.406 --> 37:11.274
"Take me away
So I can find what's real"

37:12.073 --> 37:15.337
"Find what's real"

37:16.905 --> 37:18.873
"Home"

37:23.338 --> 37:25.871
"Home"

37:25.872 --> 37:31.406
"And in the morning I will go"

37:34.073 --> 37:35.937
"I've been stuck
With the same kind of people"

37:37.338 --> 37:42.539
"Just blind and drunk
We can never see what's real"

37:43.706 --> 37:46.273
"What is real"

37:51.206 --> 37:53.273
What about that one over there?

37:54.107 --> 37:56.238
Um, that one's called Altair.

37:56.239 --> 37:58.704
And it's 16 light years away,

37:58.705 --> 38:00.872
which means the light
we're seeing now,

38:00.873 --> 38:02.540
was actually created
when we were two.

38:06.338 --> 38:07.441
Are you okay?

38:11.173 --> 38:13.407
The Berkeley coach called
my house the other night.

38:14.740 --> 38:16.039
Really?

38:16.040 --> 38:18.738
Yeah, I mean, I guess
one of the other swimmers

38:18.739 --> 38:22.774
transferred out
and another spot opened up.

38:25.305 --> 38:27.639
That's so crazy.
You could get your spot back?

38:27.640 --> 38:30.173
I mean, technically, yeah.

38:31.406 --> 38:33.172
There's this huge meet
coming up next month,

38:33.173 --> 38:36.405
and the Berkeley coach
is coming down to watch.

38:36.406 --> 38:39.171
But I'd have to get in shape by
then, which is probably impossible.

38:39.172 --> 38:40.383
And then I'd have
to swim, like,

38:40.408 --> 38:42.271
my best time ever to show
that I'm fully rehabbed...

38:42.272 --> 38:44.141
You can totally do it.

38:51.705 --> 38:54.406
There's also some reasons
to stick around here next year.

38:59.172 --> 39:01.540
Katie, I wanna take you
on a real date tomorrow.

39:03.072 --> 39:04.273
Okay.

39:06.373 --> 39:10.006
And you also need
to meet my dad.

39:17.305 --> 39:19.171
Why don't you move
a little closer there, Cody?

39:19.172 --> 39:20.805
My-My name's Charlie.

39:20.806 --> 39:21.938
- Charlie.
- Yeah.

39:21.939 --> 39:23.873
I didn't know that.

39:25.973 --> 39:30.270
Is that what you go by? You go by Charlie
and not Chuck or Chuckie or C-Town?

39:30.271 --> 39:33.405
- No, sir, I... just Charlie.
- Charlie, okay.

39:34.939 --> 39:36.838
- You ever been arrested?
- No, sir.

39:36.839 --> 39:38.338
- When's your curfew?
- It's 1:00 a.m.

39:38.339 --> 39:41.337
- What time do you actually get home?
- Like, 2:00.

39:41.338 --> 39:42.971
That's not one 1:00,
is it, Charlie?

39:42.972 --> 39:44.738
- No, sir, it's not.
- You said your curfew was 1:00.

39:44.739 --> 39:46.638
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:46.639 --> 39:48.540
Relax, I'm not a cop.

39:52.072 --> 39:53.772
How many times
a week do you shave?

39:53.773 --> 39:59.106
Shave, like four...
four times a week, sir.

39:59.107 --> 40:00.172
- Who's your team?
- Seahawks.

40:00.173 --> 40:01.405
Why?

40:01.406 --> 40:03.038
Well, because they're great.

40:03.039 --> 40:05.305
And one time I was
at this burger place and...

40:05.306 --> 40:07.840
Richard Sherman actually
ate some of my fries.

40:09.672 --> 40:10.940
That's awesome.

40:11.972 --> 40:15.906
Okay. Charlie, here's the deal.

40:17.840 --> 40:21.204
Katie appears to be
very strong, and she is.

40:21.205 --> 40:22.939
- Hey.
- She's dealing with...

40:22.940 --> 40:24.039
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:24.040 --> 40:25.639
- What you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.204
- We were...
- We're just getting to know each other.

40:28.205 --> 40:29.939
Thank you so much for letting me
take her out, Mr. Price.

40:29.940 --> 40:31.039
Okay.

40:32.106 --> 40:33.440
Don't forget your...

40:34.973 --> 40:36.840
guitar case.

40:37.706 --> 40:40.072
Wait, I'll hold it for you.

40:40.073 --> 40:43.774
Hold on a second.
I wanna get a picture of this.

40:44.740 --> 40:46.174
Okay.

40:47.206 --> 40:51.872
All right. Just a little.
There you go.

40:51.873 --> 40:53.839
A little room
for the Holy Ghost.

40:53.840 --> 40:55.638
And...

40:55.639 --> 40:58.140
And... open.

41:01.238 --> 41:03.006
I believe these are for you.

41:03.007 --> 41:04.274
Wait.

41:05.373 --> 41:08.106
- Where are we going?
- I know nothing.

41:08.107 --> 41:09.372
Fred.

41:09.373 --> 41:11.774
- Don't even try.
- Thank you, Fred.

41:15.007 --> 41:16.138
Okay, rule number one.

41:16.139 --> 41:17.904
When you're on a train,

41:17.905 --> 41:20.939
you must always travel with
Chinese food out of a backpack.

41:20.940 --> 41:24.270
Well, I wouldn't know. I've
never been on a train before.

41:24.271 --> 41:25.671
Neither have I.

41:25.672 --> 41:27.174
- Really?
- Really.

41:29.739 --> 41:30.873
Cheers.

41:34.339 --> 41:37.905
I still cannot believe that we grew up
in the same town since we were younger,

41:37.906 --> 41:39.371
and I've never seen you
out riding your bike,

41:39.372 --> 41:41.137
or out with a lemonade stand.

41:41.138 --> 41:42.638
And I would've
bought your lemonade.

41:42.639 --> 41:45.104
No, you wouldn't have.
I don't like lemonade.

41:45.105 --> 41:46.070
Who doesn't like lemonade?

41:46.071 --> 41:47.774
Me.

41:48.805 --> 41:50.285
You know I know
the real story, right?

41:51.940 --> 41:54.905
You and your dad are in
the witness protection program.

41:54.906 --> 41:57.405
And you have both testified
against a mobster.

41:58.405 --> 42:03.439
Very close, but, the truth is...

42:05.006 --> 42:08.304
I've been sent here
to monitor you.

42:08.305 --> 42:11.043
Right, and I've been given
specific instructions

42:11.068 --> 42:12.905
to never be seen
in the daylight,

42:12.906 --> 42:17.639
and I've been watching you this whole
entire time from the safety of my own room.

42:17.640 --> 42:21.070
Classic witness protection
program cover story.

42:22.640 --> 42:25.141
All right, close your eyes
and put your hands out.

42:28.406 --> 42:29.774
Okay.

42:32.772 --> 42:34.272
And open.

42:37.406 --> 42:39.540
- Try and catch 'em in your mouth.
- Hey.

42:42.773 --> 42:44.006
Thank you.

42:44.772 --> 42:47.003
And look. We're here.

42:58.139 --> 43:01.874
"Won a moment, lost a bet"

43:06.138 --> 43:09.073
"Saw a mountain, went to bed"

43:12.940 --> 43:14.373
Wait, where are you taking me?

43:15.071 --> 43:16.805
We're here.

43:16.806 --> 43:19.372
Charlie, what is this place?

43:19.373 --> 43:22.137
- It's your surprise.
- Charlie, my man.

43:22.138 --> 43:24.138
I thought Seattle
was my surprise.

43:25.271 --> 43:26.671
Come on.

43:26.672 --> 43:29.205
Where are we going?

43:29.206 --> 43:33.170
"Even if you think we're not"

43:33.171 --> 43:37.269
"We're close to close enough"

43:38.238 --> 43:41.037
- It's your first live show.
- Yeah.

43:41.038 --> 43:47.038
"We're moving
From the ground floor"

43:47.039 --> 43:50.037
"Rising tide"

43:50.038 --> 43:53.905
"As the water's pouring in"

43:53.906 --> 43:57.738
"Like it always
Should have been"

43:57.739 --> 44:01.839
"We can crawl or we can run"

44:01.840 --> 44:05.871
"Towards the sun"

44:07.139 --> 44:08.439
Whoo!

44:09.039 --> 44:10.205
So cool.

44:10.206 --> 44:12.037
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

44:12.038 --> 44:14.305
That was seriously so cool.

44:14.306 --> 44:16.237
I know.

44:16.238 --> 44:19.772
That was, I mean, literally
one of the best things ever.

44:19.773 --> 44:22.338
- Right?
- God.

44:22.339 --> 44:25.173
Live music is beautiful.

44:25.905 --> 44:27.639
You're beautiful.

44:27.640 --> 44:29.040
You're the best.

44:31.805 --> 44:34.105
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

44:36.039 --> 44:39.070
Okay. Your turn.

44:40.305 --> 44:41.873
For what?

44:45.840 --> 44:47.304
No, no, no, no, no...

44:47.305 --> 44:49.940
- Yes, yes, yes, yes...
- I am not...

44:50.971 --> 44:55.338
- You owe me a song.
- I can't do it... here.

44:55.339 --> 44:56.871
Yes, you can.

44:56.872 --> 44:58.903
Remember?
Live shows are the best.

44:58.904 --> 45:01.071
Are you hungry?
'Cause I'm hungry.

45:01.072 --> 45:02.838
And you're always hungry.

45:02.839 --> 45:08.871
Look, we can either have come
all the way to this new city,

45:08.872 --> 45:12.007
underneath the stars
and you don't play me a song...

45:13.672 --> 45:16.773
or we can continue to have
the greatest night of our lives.

45:22.105 --> 45:24.173
I'll be right here watching.

45:30.172 --> 45:32.473
Go. Come on, we're waiting.

45:37.706 --> 45:39.270
"I put my hair up"

45:39.271 --> 45:42.771
"I slap my lipstick on"

45:42.772 --> 45:45.105
"I can't decide What to wear"

45:45.106 --> 45:47.170
"I try my clothes on"

45:47.171 --> 45:50.071
"About a hundred times"

45:50.072 --> 45:52.638
"I wanna get it right"

45:52.639 --> 45:56.639
"But as long as I've got
This perfect feeling"

45:56.640 --> 46:00.037
"I know that everything
Will be right"

46:00.038 --> 46:03.970
"As long as I've got
This sweetest feeling"

46:03.971 --> 46:06.037
"My troubles will be
Out of my sight"

46:06.038 --> 46:09.104
"La da da da Da da da da"

46:09.105 --> 46:11.204
"Da da da da"

46:11.205 --> 46:13.906
"My troubles will be Miles away"

46:15.272 --> 46:17.305
"I slip my shoes on"

46:17.306 --> 46:19.739
"Take a spin or two"

46:19.740 --> 46:21.838
"Tell me
How does this look to you?"

46:21.839 --> 46:23.404
"In the mirror"

46:23.405 --> 46:25.337
"I blow a kiss in school"

46:25.338 --> 46:27.639
"'Cause I'm"

46:27.640 --> 46:29.304
"Running late for you"

46:29.305 --> 46:33.771
"But as long as I've got
This perfect feeling"

46:33.772 --> 46:37.305
"I know that everything
Will be right"

46:37.306 --> 46:41.105
"As long as I've got
This sweetest feeling"

46:41.106 --> 46:44.104
"My troubles will be
Out of my sight"

46:44.105 --> 46:46.238
"La da da da Da da da da"

46:46.239 --> 46:48.672
"Da da da da"

46:48.673 --> 46:51.004
"My troubles will be Miles away"

46:51.005 --> 46:52.206
She's good.

46:53.105 --> 46:54.903
"When you take me"

46:54.904 --> 46:57.638
"All around this town"

46:57.639 --> 46:59.937
- Whoo!
- " All the wonder we've seen"

46:59.938 --> 47:03.770
"As long as I've got This perfect feeling"

47:03.771 --> 47:07.204
"I know that everything
Will be right"

47:07.205 --> 47:10.870
"As long as I've got
This sweetest feeling"

47:10.871 --> 47:14.038
"My troubles will be
Out of my sight"

47:14.039 --> 47:16.405
"La da da da Da da da da"

47:16.406 --> 47:18.405
"Da da da da"

47:18.406 --> 47:22.136
"My troubles will be Miles away"

47:36.838 --> 47:39.170
Okay, I probably would have
said you were good no matter what,

47:39.171 --> 47:42.871
but you were really,
really good.

47:42.872 --> 47:45.405
You know, you have to do
something with your music.

47:45.406 --> 47:48.139
- No, I couldn't.
- You have to, Katie. It was amazing.

47:51.005 --> 47:52.803
Are you ready?

47:52.804 --> 47:54.738
For what?

47:54.739 --> 47:56.305
To go swimming.

47:57.705 --> 48:00.004
No, Katie, you know
I don't swim anymore.

48:00.005 --> 48:03.105
Yes, you do. You just
haven't swam in a while.

48:03.106 --> 48:05.870
And I've never swam
in this water before,

48:05.871 --> 48:08.404
so you're gonna take me.

48:11.139 --> 48:13.270
- Come on!
- No, I'm serious. I'm not swimming.

48:13.271 --> 48:15.404
But you made me sing
and I didn't want to.

48:15.405 --> 48:17.304
- That was totally different.
- No, it's not!

48:17.305 --> 48:20.839
Okay, do you have any idea
how cold that water is?

48:21.704 --> 48:23.206
Charlie.

48:24.939 --> 48:28.005
We could've either come
all the way to the beach

48:28.006 --> 48:31.171
under the beautiful stars
and not go swimming,

48:31.172 --> 48:35.038
or we could jump into that water

48:35.039 --> 48:37.903
and continue to make this
the best night of our lives.

48:37.904 --> 48:40.539
- I don't have a swimsuit.
- Neither do I.

48:45.838 --> 48:47.272
Katie.

48:49.738 --> 48:50.738
You coming?

48:57.639 --> 48:58.906
Hurry up!

49:01.305 --> 49:03.139
My God. It's so cold.

49:07.072 --> 49:10.273
Put your arms forward
and then push.

49:12.406 --> 49:15.540
The breast stroke? It seems like a trick.

49:19.106 --> 49:21.338
Kinda.

49:21.339 --> 49:25.373
See, this isn't so bad.
You don't hate the water.

49:28.904 --> 49:30.838
I don't hate anything
when I'm with you.

49:50.006 --> 49:52.406
Have you thought any
more about your Berkeley spot?

49:54.138 --> 49:55.872
No.

50:00.172 --> 50:03.338
You know, I just keep thinking
about after the surgery,

50:03.339 --> 50:05.272
when I couldn't swim.

50:09.139 --> 50:12.106
You know, I just realized
I didn't even know who I was.

50:13.639 --> 50:15.473
And neither did anybody else.

50:18.405 --> 50:22.704
All these kids that I've been going
to school with for 15 years, they...

50:22.705 --> 50:24.939
they just saw me
as that guy in the pool.

50:29.106 --> 50:31.540
I don't have to live
that life anymore.

50:32.339 --> 50:33.872
You know...

50:34.939 --> 50:37.006
you're not the guy in the pool.

50:38.271 --> 50:43.106
But you're not the guy
that doesn't try either.

50:49.904 --> 50:54.140
Do everything you can
right now and then decide.

50:55.739 --> 50:57.939
'Cause now is all that matters.

51:03.306 --> 51:05.037
You're right.

51:05.038 --> 51:06.872
Okay.

51:11.206 --> 51:13.105
Speaking of tomorrow morning,

51:13.106 --> 51:15.405
ready for the greatest sunrise
on the planet?

51:19.639 --> 51:21.272
What?

51:23.373 --> 51:25.140
Charlie, what time is it?

51:29.171 --> 51:30.472
It's 4:50.

51:33.071 --> 51:35.139
It's not waterproof.

51:40.039 --> 51:41.737
- My God.
- What?

51:41.738 --> 51:43.305
- My God! My God!
- Katie, wait!

51:43.306 --> 51:44.405
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

51:44.406 --> 51:46.273
- I need to go!
- Katie, wait! Katie!

51:50.704 --> 51:52.372
Katie!

51:56.338 --> 51:58.205
Shit.

52:06.671 --> 52:08.039
Hey, get in. Let me drive you.

52:10.139 --> 52:13.304
Go, Charlie, go!

52:13.305 --> 52:14.871
Katie!

52:14.872 --> 52:16.903
- What the hell is going on?
- You don't understand.

52:16.904 --> 52:19.305
- You have to go as fast as you can!
- Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

52:19.306 --> 52:22.105
- Katie, what...
- Please just go, Charlie.

52:22.106 --> 52:23.771
- You're scaring me.
- You have to speed! Faster!

52:23.772 --> 52:24.873
Okay, okay!

52:27.804 --> 52:29.005
My God.

52:29.772 --> 52:31.872
Katie!

52:32.405 --> 52:34.038
Katie!

52:36.106 --> 52:38.839
Katie!

52:41.105 --> 52:43.172
Katie. Katie!

52:44.205 --> 52:46.804
Katie.

52:48.738 --> 52:50.836
Katie, will you please
just talk to me?

52:53.305 --> 52:55.372
- Katie, please, just talk to me!
- Hey!

52:55.373 --> 52:57.737
- Is she inside?
- Yes.

52:57.738 --> 52:59.405
Is she in there? Move!
Just move!

53:00.972 --> 53:03.138
- How could you let this happen to her?
- Let what happen?

53:03.139 --> 53:04.937
What happened?

53:04.938 --> 53:07.270
She not... tell you?

53:07.271 --> 53:09.509
Tell me what? I have
no idea what's going on!

53:09.534 --> 53:10.871
She's sick. She's sick.

53:10.872 --> 53:13.638
- What do you mean she's sick?
- She has XP.

53:13.639 --> 53:16.738
She can't go in the sun at all.
It can kill her. I'm sorry.

53:16.739 --> 53:19.406
Katie?

53:40.639 --> 53:43.970
This is a nice hospital.

53:43.971 --> 53:46.173
I bet they have
really good food.

53:48.638 --> 53:50.272
Katie Price?

53:51.205 --> 53:52.540
We're ready.

54:09.972 --> 54:12.273
It was like a second, if that.

54:13.239 --> 54:15.104
Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

54:15.105 --> 54:16.538
We're good, Mr. P.

54:20.972 --> 54:22.737
Hey.

54:22.738 --> 54:24.272
Is she okay?

54:42.771 --> 54:45.137
Okay, Katie, you can sit up. Nurse
Jane will take you back outside.

54:45.138 --> 54:48.439
Um, actually, I wanna stay.

54:50.739 --> 54:54.703
Okay. The sunlight exposure
was minimal.

54:54.704 --> 54:58.005
The physical effects you're
seeing right now will heal.

54:58.006 --> 55:02.737
But, as you know, XP generally lies
dormant until there's a triggering event.

55:02.738 --> 55:04.637
We won't know if
that's what this was

55:04.638 --> 55:07.206
until we get the results back from
your blood work and CT scans.

55:08.705 --> 55:10.738
And if this was
a triggering event?

55:10.739 --> 55:13.771
We'll cross that bridge if we come to it.

55:13.772 --> 55:15.903
If you experience
any symptoms...

55:15.904 --> 55:19.738
unexpected shaking, muscular
pain, loss of motor function,

55:19.739 --> 55:21.704
you need to let us know
immediately.

55:21.705 --> 55:24.439
Okay. I'm gonna go
get dressed now.

55:26.705 --> 55:30.237
I'm pretty busy during the day,
but I could be free at night.

55:32.006 --> 55:34.370
I can be free at night.

55:34.371 --> 55:36.305
My dad's super protective.

55:38.771 --> 55:40.737
What about UW?

55:40.738 --> 55:42.804
What about the study? Have
they started the second phase?

55:42.805 --> 55:45.538
I followed up with them
last week. No news yet.

55:47.771 --> 55:50.005
Okay. Thanks.

55:59.404 --> 56:01.539
All right, Charlie.
Let's get back to work.

56:21.004 --> 56:22.811
Look, I know I told you
to play hard to get

56:22.836 --> 56:24.762
but you should at least
see what he has to say.

56:31.537 --> 56:33.763
He's asking if he can
come over and talk to you.

56:33.788 --> 56:34.529
Don't.

56:35.971 --> 56:37.470
Please just delete them.

56:37.471 --> 56:39.204
Katie.

56:39.205 --> 56:42.604
Look, if I read them,
then I'm gonna reply,

56:42.605 --> 56:46.870
then he's gonna reply
and then we're gonna meet up.

56:46.871 --> 56:48.470
Which we can't.

56:48.471 --> 56:50.271
Why can't you? I...

56:50.272 --> 56:52.571
You don't have to be a martyr just
to protect Charlie's feelings.

56:52.572 --> 56:54.536
He's a big boy.
I'm sure he can handle it.

56:54.537 --> 56:57.571
I can't handle it.
Okay?

57:00.105 --> 57:03.171
He's gonna get hurt, and I'm not
gonna be the one who hurts him.

57:03.172 --> 57:05.239
So, please, can you
just delete them?

57:09.972 --> 57:12.072
Yeah. Okay.

57:57.071 --> 57:59.370
We should do
another set of tests.

57:59.371 --> 58:01.571
The results could
come back different.

58:01.572 --> 58:04.138
Her brain has begun to contract.

58:04.139 --> 58:06.403
- Once the neural pathways...
- What about the study?

58:06.404 --> 58:09.336
They shut it down, Jack.

58:09.337 --> 58:12.638
I found out this morning.
There's no funding.

58:26.505 --> 58:28.370
No, I...

58:28.371 --> 58:31.072
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

58:35.039 --> 58:37.973
I mean, from the time
she was very young...

58:39.239 --> 58:41.106
no matter how much she...

58:42.505 --> 58:44.239
cried...

58:45.072 --> 58:47.406
or screamed or moaned...

58:48.238 --> 58:49.671
I wouldn't let her go outside.

58:55.471 --> 58:58.038
I wouldn't let her
go to the park.

58:59.205 --> 59:02.470
I wouldn't even let her
go to the beach.

59:02.471 --> 59:04.937
And she begged me.

59:04.938 --> 59:06.671
She begged me...

59:09.938 --> 59:12.237
for things that
she had every right to.

59:12.238 --> 59:14.672
And I denied her all of it.

59:15.572 --> 59:18.236
I mean, for what?

59:18.237 --> 59:21.073
For this? No.

59:36.305 --> 59:40.838
XP is a disease that tends to
take the joy from a child's life.

59:40.839 --> 59:42.403
In all these years
I've treated Katie,

59:42.404 --> 59:45.369
she's never complained,
she's never sulked.

59:45.370 --> 59:47.639
She always sees
the good in things.

59:50.271 --> 59:52.971
And the way she talks about you?

59:52.972 --> 59:56.604
I've never seen a teenager
so openly adore her father.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:02.373
You're a good father, Jack.

01:00:06.004 --> 01:00:07.405
How long?

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:10.305
It's hard to say for sure.

01:01:32.839 --> 01:01:35.003
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey, Dad.

01:01:35.004 --> 01:01:38.038
I'm starving.
Wanna get some Chinese?

01:01:38.039 --> 01:01:40.937
- "Yuh."
- Is that a yeah?

01:01:40.938 --> 01:01:42.604
What are you doing?

01:01:43.839 --> 01:01:46.304
I'm starting you
an online dating profile.

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:49.072
- What?
- Yeah.

01:01:50.205 --> 01:01:53.103
Look, okay.
So, I have this photo of you,

01:01:53.104 --> 01:01:54.937
which I think your hair
looks better in.

01:01:54.938 --> 01:01:57.143
But then in this one
you have your camera.

01:01:57.168 --> 01:01:58.169
No, no, no, no.

01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:01.038
- This is not happening.
- No, no, no. This is happening.

01:02:01.039 --> 01:02:02.938
Here, just take a seat.
Wanna help me write it?

01:02:02.939 --> 01:02:05.370
I don't know.

01:02:05.371 --> 01:02:08.570
Okay, here's what I have so far.

01:02:08.571 --> 01:02:11.945
"World's greatest father and
handsomest photographer."

01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:13.069
Veto.

01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:15.270
"Looking for a fellow adventurer

01:02:15.271 --> 01:02:20.203
interested in art, photography and
nostalgia about the Supersonics."

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:23.403
- Supersonics is good. That's important.
- I knew you would like that.

01:02:23.404 --> 01:02:26.150
Um, "a partner in crime
to travel the world with."

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:27.628
I don't travel, honey.

01:02:28.872 --> 01:02:31.206
You will though.

01:02:35.305 --> 01:02:37.004
All right, we're not doing this.

01:02:37.005 --> 01:02:39.973
Please, please, please,
I want to.

01:02:43.205 --> 01:02:45.372
You lost Mom and now
you're gonna lose me too.

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:57.103
No. No, there's
always a chance.

01:02:57.104 --> 01:03:00.370
We've always known it's
a matter of when and not if.

01:03:00.371 --> 01:03:05.471
So I really need you
to be selfish and...

01:03:07.003 --> 01:03:10.437
go out there and, you know,
take those beautiful photos

01:03:10.438 --> 01:03:12.370
and start traveling
the world again.

01:03:12.371 --> 01:03:15.336
- I want everyone to see your photos, Dad.
- Just stop.

01:03:15.337 --> 01:03:18.837
Okay, I can't...
I can't...

01:03:18.838 --> 01:03:21.038
I just want you...

01:03:22.537 --> 01:03:25.437
to promise me that you're
gonna take care of yourself.

01:03:25.438 --> 01:03:29.371
I really want you to have as happy
a life as the one you've given me.

01:03:30.304 --> 01:03:32.537
And try and find someone

01:03:32.538 --> 01:03:36.270
that you can share these
incredible adventures with.

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:39.139
Because having someone...

01:03:42.405 --> 01:03:44.405
that's the best part.

01:03:45.604 --> 01:03:50.571
So please, just pick
a rando lady and take her out.

01:03:55.104 --> 01:03:56.937
Okay.

01:03:56.938 --> 01:03:58.504
Okay.

01:03:59.538 --> 01:04:01.739
- Promise me.
- I promise.

01:04:07.238 --> 01:04:09.073
Good.

01:04:12.304 --> 01:04:15.038
Now we can order Chinese food.

01:04:16.905 --> 01:04:20.103
- Come on!
- That was so a ball.

01:04:20.104 --> 01:04:23.168
That's... That's not even baseball.
I don't know what that is.

01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:32.205
Food. Finally. What took them so long?

01:04:38.271 --> 01:04:41.870
My God.
Charlie's outside.

01:04:41.871 --> 01:04:44.070
I know. I called him.

01:04:44.071 --> 01:04:46.503
What? Why?

01:04:46.504 --> 01:04:48.204
Because...

01:04:50.137 --> 01:04:53.103
you said the best part was having
someone to share your adventures with.

01:04:53.104 --> 01:04:57.838
So, go talk to him.
Tell him the truth.

01:04:57.839 --> 01:05:00.369
He deserves that.

01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:02.304
And so do you.

01:05:09.938 --> 01:05:11.604
You exist.

01:05:13.004 --> 01:05:15.138
This time I was positive
I dreamt you.

01:05:18.305 --> 01:05:20.103
Charlie, I'm so sorry.

01:05:20.104 --> 01:05:23.069
Katie, this isn't something you
can just not tell me.

01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:27.337
I'm so, so sorry
I didn't tell you.

01:05:27.338 --> 01:05:28.739
That's...

01:05:31.903 --> 01:05:36.505
unforgivable and
very selfish on my part.

01:05:39.438 --> 01:05:42.072
We were never gonna work.

01:05:43.305 --> 01:05:45.105
But I wanted us to.

01:05:46.438 --> 01:05:49.138
You, me, we...

01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:53.137
we don't win in the end.

01:05:54.037 --> 01:05:56.137
So...

01:05:56.138 --> 01:05:57.739
So I'm saying good-bye,
Charlie.

01:06:01.003 --> 01:06:02.471
Good-bye.

01:06:09.938 --> 01:06:12.504
You know, that was the worst
break-up speech I've ever heard.

01:06:12.505 --> 01:06:16.070
- What?
- Yeah. Like a D-minus would be generous.

01:06:16.071 --> 01:06:18.469
Zeros from all the judges Katie.
It was a total flop.

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:21.569
I've never done this before!
What do you expect?

01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:26.571
Seriously, Charlie.
We can't.

01:06:28.438 --> 01:06:30.237
We can.

01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:40.738
What I can't do...

01:06:41.904 --> 01:06:43.937
I can't stop being with you.

01:06:43.938 --> 01:06:47.336
Katie, I've done
my research on XP.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:50.103
I know what it is. I know
what you are going through.

01:06:50.104 --> 01:06:52.970
But we're not the couple
who doesn't try.

01:06:52.971 --> 01:06:55.404
You knew that before I did.

01:07:07.038 --> 01:07:09.336
You've changed my life, Katie.

01:07:09.337 --> 01:07:11.738
Okay, you can either just leave
me here on this porch or...

01:07:13.038 --> 01:07:16.204
or we can have the best summer
of our lives.

01:07:18.404 --> 01:07:20.301
What's it gonna be?

01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:09.472
Go, Charlie! Push it!

01:08:12.537 --> 01:08:14.204
Go, Charlie!

01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:22.738
That's it, Charlie! Come on!

01:08:26.037 --> 01:08:28.970
- Charlie, let's go!
- Whoo! Whoo!

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:33.136
Go, Charlie!
Come on, Charlie! Go! Go!

01:08:38.203 --> 01:08:40.069
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

01:08:40.069 --> 01:08:42.537
Yeah!

01:08:42.537 --> 01:08:44.470
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

01:08:46.304 --> 01:08:49.870
The Berkeley coach was impressed and
they promised to keep in touch.

01:08:49.871 --> 01:08:53.336
In touch is good. They'll be in touch.
I'm so proud of you, honey.

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:55.504
So good.

01:08:59.071 --> 01:09:00.569
Hey, I'll be right back.

01:09:00.571 --> 01:09:02.138
Sure.

01:09:04.437 --> 01:09:06.368
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi.

01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:09.203
- The rumors are true. Congrats.
- Thank you.

01:09:09.205 --> 01:09:12.072
- You were great in there.
- Thank you for letting Katie come.

01:09:12.903 --> 01:09:14.470
I couldn't have stopped her.

01:09:15.371 --> 01:09:17.469
Mr. Price,

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:19.372
would you mind if I took
Katie out tomorrow?

01:09:22.437 --> 01:09:24.370
Yeah.

01:09:24.371 --> 01:09:26.102
Yeah, I think that'd be fine.

01:09:26.103 --> 01:09:27.470
Thank you.

01:10:06.537 --> 01:10:09.604
- Come on. Come on.
- I'm so confused. What are we...

01:10:18.238 --> 01:10:20.569
- What is this?
- It's for you.

01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:22.870
- Is this Katie?
- Yeah.

01:10:22.871 --> 01:10:25.369
Let's do this.

01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:28.602
- No. My God, no.
- Katie. Katie, yes.

01:10:28.603 --> 01:10:30.337
- No, I can't. I can't.
- Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

01:10:30.338 --> 01:10:32.138
Yes.

01:10:33.904 --> 01:10:37.403
This is so crazy. How... How
did you even pay for this?

01:10:37.404 --> 01:10:40.336
- Don't worry about it.
- Charlie, your truck money?

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:42.469
- I can't let you...
- Katie, it's already done.

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:47.738
Okay, you helped me figure out my
dreams and now it's payback time.

01:10:50.737 --> 01:10:52.802
I can't play anymore.

01:10:52.803 --> 01:10:55.172
Then just sing.

01:11:02.605 --> 01:11:04.669
Whenever you're ready, Katie.

01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:07.170
Let's lay one down.

01:11:07.171 --> 01:11:08.805
Thank you.

01:11:11.504 --> 01:11:13.504
How did you get this?

01:11:13.505 --> 01:11:16.504
This is the song I've been working on.

01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:18.937
Stole your notebook again.

01:11:32.504 --> 01:11:34.202
"I wish"

01:11:34.203 --> 01:11:36.036
"I could stand"

01:11:36.037 --> 01:11:37.605
"On a star"

01:11:39.771 --> 01:11:41.537
"I wish"

01:11:41.538 --> 01:11:43.370
"I could be"

01:11:43.371 --> 01:11:45.272
"Where you are"

01:11:47.404 --> 01:11:52.404
"They say don't you
Ever give up"

01:11:54.303 --> 01:11:59.671
"It's so hard to be something
When you're not"

01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:05.336
"But I have walked alone"

01:12:05.337 --> 01:12:09.202
"With the stars
In the moonlit night"

01:12:09.203 --> 01:12:12.637
"I have walked alone"

01:12:12.638 --> 01:12:16.302
"No one by my side"

01:12:16.303 --> 01:12:19.803
"Now I walk with you"

01:12:19.804 --> 01:12:23.504
"With my head held high"

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:27.369
"In the darkest sky"

01:12:27.370 --> 01:12:31.001
"I feel so alive"

01:12:36.303 --> 01:12:37.772
No.

01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:40.503
Yeah, really good job.

01:12:40.504 --> 01:12:42.671
Let me count our chips.

01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:53.538
- That one.
- That one?

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:56.703
That's Charlinium,

01:12:56.704 --> 01:13:01.270
because it is huge and powerful.

01:13:01.271 --> 01:13:04.770
And that one is my favorite.

01:13:04.771 --> 01:13:08.103
That one is Burritorium,

01:13:08.104 --> 01:13:10.405
because it's shaped
like a burrito.

01:13:11.437 --> 01:13:13.602
That one is Procyon.

01:13:13.603 --> 01:13:15.837
It's 11 light years away.

01:13:17.104 --> 01:13:20.837
So we were seven
when that light was made.

01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:28.504
That was, um, right around the time
you got your first skateboard.

01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:32.337
What?

01:13:35.603 --> 01:13:38.937
Charlie, that night we met
at the train station...

01:13:40.404 --> 01:13:42.436
I already knew you.

01:13:42.437 --> 01:13:44.504
Wh-What do you mean?

01:13:46.204 --> 01:13:49.236
In elementary school,

01:13:49.237 --> 01:13:53.602
you walked by window every day
on your way to swim practice.

01:13:53.603 --> 01:13:57.069
And in fourth grade,

01:13:57.070 --> 01:13:59.337
you started skateboarding.

01:13:59.338 --> 01:14:05.336
And in sixth grade, you wore a
Ken Griffey Jr. jersey every day

01:14:05.337 --> 01:14:07.937
for, like, a month straight.

01:14:09.238 --> 01:14:12.535
And in ninth grade,

01:14:12.536 --> 01:14:15.237
you buzzed off all your hair.

01:14:16.771 --> 01:14:18.505
And...

01:14:23.203 --> 01:14:25.271
every day...

01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:30.405
I waited for you
to walk by my window...

01:14:33.504 --> 01:14:36.305
and it was the best part
of my day.

01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:41.272
If I had just looked up...

01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:45.870
I could've been with you
this whole time.

01:14:49.370 --> 01:14:50.704
You were.

01:14:58.204 --> 01:14:59.539
I...

01:15:00.704 --> 01:15:02.703
I love you, Charlie.

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.538
I love you too.

01:15:12.303 --> 01:15:15.368
I can't believe you still
like me after that buzz cut.

01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:19.605
It was so ugly.
My God.

01:15:51.103 --> 01:15:53.370
Okay, there's some more chicken,
but I'm eating the rest of the noodles,

01:15:53.371 --> 01:15:55.302
if no one wants them.

01:15:55.303 --> 01:15:58.403
Okay. I'm gonna go to the marina.
I'll be back in an hour.

01:15:58.404 --> 01:16:00.668
Someday I wanna see this
Beyoncé-worthy yacht you're cleaning.

01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:02.503
You're gonna miss your chance.

01:16:02.504 --> 01:16:05.572
Owner's back tomorrow.
It's my last checkup.

01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:08.938
- See you in an hour?
- Okay.

01:16:11.569 --> 01:16:14.369
- I'll walk you out.
- All right. I'll see you.

01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:16.569
One of these days we can

01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:18.604
take her for a sail
around the harbor.

01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:21.937
We can watch the sun set.

01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:25.539
Wait.

01:16:27.038 --> 01:16:29.703
I... I wanna go with him.

01:16:29.704 --> 01:16:31.938
Go where, honey?

01:16:32.737 --> 01:16:34.272
Out.

01:16:35.071 --> 01:16:37.536
Sailing on the boat.

01:16:37.537 --> 01:16:40.604
I wanna go with him
on the boat. Now.

01:16:45.569 --> 01:16:46.803
Honey.

01:16:46.804 --> 01:16:49.671
- It'd be better if you just...
- Please, Dad.

01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:54.405
Let me do this.

01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:02.137
It's okay, Dad.

01:17:02.138 --> 01:17:04.438
I really want to.

01:17:14.469 --> 01:17:16.169
Okay.

01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:21.336
"I have seen A thousand things"

01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:26.269
"A thousand minds
And what they bring"

01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:31.269
"To this world And to this home"

01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:37.436
"But where I stand Well, I"

01:17:37.437 --> 01:17:40.671
"Don't know"

01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:01.671
"I'm an open book"

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:08.202
"I'll tell you everything
I know"

01:18:08.203 --> 01:18:14.503
"To the darkest corners
Of my mind"

01:18:16.603 --> 01:18:20.803
"My kingdom is wide"

01:18:20.804 --> 01:18:25.335
"So wide-eyed
I can't track the time"

01:18:25.336 --> 01:18:31.803
"Between the spaces Of my mind"

01:18:34.037 --> 01:18:38.602
"'Cause I have seen
A thousand things"

01:18:38.603 --> 01:18:43.202
"A thousand minds
And what they bring"

01:18:43.203 --> 01:18:48.070
I've waited my whole life to feel this.

01:18:48.071 --> 01:18:51.736
"But where I stand
Well, I don't know"

01:18:51.737 --> 01:18:55.769
"And people come And people go"

01:18:55.770 --> 01:19:00.268
"People I will never know"

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:04.536
"But if I did And if I could"

01:19:04.537 --> 01:19:09.103
"I'd wonder when
And where they stood"

01:19:09.104 --> 01:19:14.069
"'Cause I have seen
A thousand things"

01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:18.702
"A thousand minds
And what they bring"

01:19:18.703 --> 01:19:23.335
"To this world And to this home"

01:19:23.336 --> 01:19:29.468
"But where I stand Well, I"

01:19:29.469 --> 01:19:31.603
"Don't know"

01:21:18.302 --> 01:21:21.037
There he is.

01:21:21.038 --> 01:21:23.169
Hey, Mr. Price.

01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:25.269
Glad you made it by
before you took off.

01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:27.702
Of course. I'm...
I'm actually leaving today.

01:21:27.703 --> 01:21:29.235
Yeah.

01:21:29.236 --> 01:21:31.469
The first practice is
in a couple of days, so...

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:33.703
- That's exciting!
- Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

01:21:33.704 --> 01:21:36.603
Your coach sent me your schedule, so
I'm hoping to make it down for a meet.

01:21:36.604 --> 01:21:39.671
But why would, my coach
send you the schedule?

01:21:41.237 --> 01:21:43.770
We stayed in touch, I guess,
after Katie reached out.

01:21:43.771 --> 01:21:46.503
- Katie reached out.
- Yeah.

01:21:46.504 --> 01:21:50.537
She called him. Told him that he
needed to take another look at you.

01:21:51.504 --> 01:21:53.568
No, Katie never told me.

01:21:53.569 --> 01:21:55.535
You know what? Hold that
thought, all right?

01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:57.570
I got something for you.

01:22:10.337 --> 01:22:11.938
She wanted you to have that.

01:22:25.569 --> 01:22:27.172
I...

01:22:28.604 --> 01:22:31.404
I never said sorry.

01:22:32.404 --> 01:22:36.035
I never apologized to you.

01:22:36.036 --> 01:22:38.469
I should have never kept Katie
out that late and I...

01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:40.171
Stop.

01:22:41.102 --> 01:22:42.670
Stop!

01:22:43.737 --> 01:22:46.538
It's nobody's fault.
Okay?

01:22:49.303 --> 01:22:52.769
We knew from the
time that she was little

01:22:52.770 --> 01:22:54.937
that every day
was gonna be a gift.

01:22:56.503 --> 01:22:58.335
I should be thanking you.

01:23:00.537 --> 01:23:02.938
All I ever wanted to do
was make her happy.

01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:06.671
And you made her so happy.

01:23:08.404 --> 01:23:09.538
Thank you.

01:23:15.670 --> 01:23:18.538
- Good luck at school, son.
- Thank you.

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:31.168
Coming up next, we have
a song that is blowing up on YouTube

01:23:31.169 --> 01:23:33.436
with over two million views
in just two weeks.

01:23:33.437 --> 01:23:35.435
Get ready to hear it
all over the airwaves.

01:23:35.436 --> 01:23:37.268
Just remember
you heard it here first.

01:23:37.269 --> 01:23:40.300
This is "Charlie's Song"
by Katie Price.

01:23:42.704 --> 01:23:44.235
"I wish"

01:23:44.236 --> 01:23:46.068
"I could be"

01:23:46.069 --> 01:23:47.670
"Where you are"

01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:54.803
"They say don't you
Ever give up"

01:23:57.036 --> 01:24:02.270
"It's so hard to be something
When you're not"

01:24:04.036 --> 01:24:08.436
"But I have walked alone"

01:24:08.437 --> 01:24:12.036
"With the stars
In the moonlit night"

01:24:12.037 --> 01:24:15.269
"I have walked alone"

01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:18.770
"No one by my side"

01:24:18.771 --> 01:24:22.503
"Now I walk with you"

01:24:22.504 --> 01:24:26.335
"With my head held high"

01:24:26.336 --> 01:24:30.102
"In the darkest sky"

01:24:30.103 --> 01:24:33.804
"I feel so alive"

01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:47.871
"But you're here On my mind"

01:24:49.637 --> 01:24:54.268
"But I have walked alone"

01:24:54.269 --> 01:24:57.469
"With the stars
In the moonlit night"

01:24:57.470 --> 01:25:01.169
- " I have walked alone"
- Yes!

01:25:01.170 --> 01:25:04.569
- " No one by my side"
- Yes! Hey!

01:25:04.570 --> 01:25:07.669
- Hey, that's my girl! Hey, that's my girl!
- " Now I walk with you"

01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:10.469
Did you hear this? Put down the...
Put it down! Listen! Listen!

01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:12.402
"Head held high"

01:25:12.403 --> 01:25:15.669
"In the darkest sky"

01:25:15.670 --> 01:25:19.504
"I feel so alive"

01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:23.102
Dear, Charlie.

01:25:23.103 --> 01:25:29.035
I've always been more comfortable writing
song lyrics than actual sentences.

01:25:29.036 --> 01:25:31.770
There's no way I can articulate
what you've meant to me.

01:25:31.771 --> 01:25:34.636
Since that moment
we first saw each other,

01:25:34.637 --> 01:25:39.668
or the joy you've brought me since
I first saw you outside my window.

01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:42.436
Even though our time together
was short,

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:46.135
the stars have been burning
for every moment of it.

01:25:46.136 --> 01:25:49.569
And the light from those moments will be
shining down for the next thousand years.

01:25:49.570 --> 01:25:53.703
"But I have walked alone"

01:25:53.704 --> 01:25:59.368
I hope that somehow I'll be able
to look down and see you, Charlie,

01:25:59.369 --> 01:26:04.036
and all of the incredible moments
just waiting for you out there.

01:26:04.037 --> 01:26:05.602
And if you need me,

01:26:05.603 --> 01:26:08.435
all you have to do is look up.

01:26:08.436 --> 01:26:10.468
And remember...

01:26:10.469 --> 01:26:12.036
I love you.
