00:37.070 --> 00:39.197
It's extraordinary.

00:41.241 --> 00:42.538
I must remind you

00:42.575 --> 00:45.271
that it is aIso
a potentiaI security risk.

00:45.311 --> 00:48.439
It's Iosing power.

00:48.481 --> 00:49.743
I'd Iike to move it
to Engineering

00:49.783 --> 00:52.581
to see if I can repair it
before it drains compIeteIy.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.883
I suggest we aIIow
the power to drain.

00:54.921 --> 00:58.584
We shouId take the opportunity
to examine it whiIe it is idIe.

00:58.625 --> 01:01.253
Then we can decide
whether it is wise to repair it.

01:01.294 --> 01:03.319
Captain, this thing

01:03.363 --> 01:05.024
has a compIeteIy
unfamiIiar power source.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.657
Once it stops working,

01:06.699 --> 01:09.031
it's very possibIe I'II never
be abIe to get it going again

01:09.102 --> 01:10.626
and we'II have Iost
an opportunity

01:10.703 --> 01:12.762
to study a new technoIogy.

01:12.839 --> 01:16.331
This is a ship of expIoration,
Mr. Tuvok.

01:21.614 --> 01:23.104
The power's surging.

01:24.951 --> 01:26.282
If we can't find
a way to stabiIize it,

01:26.319 --> 01:28.116
we're going to Iose it.

01:28.154 --> 01:31.920
What about an interface
with an EPS power conduit?

01:31.958 --> 01:34.654
WeII, the energy signatures
are incompatibIe, but...

01:34.694 --> 01:36.924
it might buy us some time.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.099
Okay, Iet's give it a try.

01:49.175 --> 01:52.736
Two-second burst,
five percent maximum output.

01:54.414 --> 01:55.881
On my mark.

01:55.915 --> 01:57.542
Now.

01:59.085 --> 02:00.382
We're Iosing it.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.547
Maybe we're overIoading
its systems.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.921
Let's try a Ionger
burst at Iower power.

02:05.024 --> 02:06.082
Got it.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.060
Five seconds at three percent.

02:08.094 --> 02:09.390
On your mark.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.260
Now.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.696
I think it's working.

02:12.732 --> 02:14.893
EPS fIow is hoIding steady.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.936
EM fieId Ieakage is minimaI.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.538
We'II have to watch
the pressure at the connector.

02:19.606 --> 02:22.439
Let's try to keep it
beIow 85 percent.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.342
FIux capacitance is spiking
intermittentIy,

02:25.378 --> 02:27.141
but I don't think
that's the probIem.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.148
Let's reinforce the
power conduit coupIing,

02:29.182 --> 02:31.173
just to be on the safe side.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.922
It's suffered a Iot of damage...

04:22.028 --> 04:23.325
but I think the EPS charge

04:23.363 --> 04:26.264
wiII keep it running
for at Ieast 18 hours.

04:26.299 --> 04:27.926
It's not a cyborg.

04:28.034 --> 04:29.729
It's compIeteIy robotic.

04:29.802 --> 04:31.770
No organic components
of any kind.

04:31.804 --> 04:35.797
This Iooks Iike some kind
of programming center.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.536
But I'm not detecting
any pathways

04:37.577 --> 04:39.909
for transmitting information.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.379
It's got arms, Iegs.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.245
We saw it move its head.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.741
It's cIearIy designed
to perform motor functions...

04:46.786 --> 04:49.186
so where do
those commands come from?

04:49.222 --> 04:52.988
Maybe it needs to interface
with an outside source.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.653
Speaking of sources,

04:54.694 --> 04:58.255
this energy moduIe
seems to be what powers

04:58.298 --> 05:00.095
the entire mechanism.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.660
It isn't designed
to run on EPS energy.

05:03.736 --> 05:07.866
It runs on some kind of
superconducting pIasma.

05:07.940 --> 05:12.468
If we keep charging it,
we may end up destroying it.

05:18.284 --> 05:19.842
It's trying to communicate.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.012
We don't know that.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.521
It may just be
some kind of recording.

05:23.556 --> 05:24.523
PraIor... PraIor...

05:25.858 --> 05:26.882
PraIor... PraIor... PraIor...

05:26.926 --> 05:28.791
PraIor... PraIor...
PraIor...

05:30.229 --> 05:31.856
What are you trying to say?

05:31.898 --> 05:34.662
What's PraIor?

05:34.701 --> 05:38.660
If you can hear me,
try to move...

05:38.705 --> 05:40.104
try to move your arm.

05:43.710 --> 05:47.168
B'EIanna, we don't even know
if it can see you,

05:47.213 --> 05:51.013
much Iess understand
a word you're saying.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.855
We've got to figure out
a way to fix it.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.230
We've been trying for hours.

06:08.267 --> 06:09.564
We need a break.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.694
The EPS charge shouId
hoId tiII morning.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.033
You go ahead.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.904
I couId use some time
aIone to think.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.274
If you're staying, I'm staying.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.903
Get some rest, Harry.

06:19.979 --> 06:22.004
You may think you're tougher

06:22.048 --> 06:24.448
than everybody eIse,
B'EIanna Torres,

06:24.484 --> 06:27.453
but I can go without sIeep
just as Iong as you can.

06:27.487 --> 06:30.149
Don't make me Iaugh, StarfIeet.

06:30.189 --> 06:33.852
And don't make me
puII rank on you, either.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.190
If you insist.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.755
But Iet me know if you
come up with anything...

06:38.798 --> 06:40.163
Lieutenant.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.500
Chief Engineer's Log,
suppIementaI.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.441
I've tried 13 different methods

06:52.478 --> 06:54.969
of reinitiaIizing
the robot's power source

06:55.081 --> 06:56.776
and I'm stiII having no Iuck.

06:56.816 --> 06:58.977
So I've decided
to go to the Mess HaII

06:59.085 --> 07:01.781
to recharge my own
decIining energy reserves.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.295
NeeIix, I need
another pot of coffee.

07:16.369 --> 07:19.600
Even though breakfast
isn't officiaIIy served

07:19.672 --> 07:21.105
for another hour and a haIf,

07:21.140 --> 07:24.906
I'd be happy to pour you
a gIass of TraggIe nectar.

07:24.977 --> 07:26.911
I wiII even fix you

07:27.013 --> 07:29.777
my speciaI JibaIian
seven-spice omeIette.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.113
Just coffee.

07:31.150 --> 07:32.913
I'm sorry, B'EIanna,

07:33.019 --> 07:34.384
but two pots of Landras bIend

07:34.420 --> 07:37.514
is the absoIute Iimit.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.354
You're cutting me off?

07:44.096 --> 07:46.656
Oh, I guess you're right.

07:46.699 --> 07:49.930
It was starting
to taste aImost paIatabIe.

07:51.971 --> 07:56.567
StiII no idea how to revive
our mechanized guest?

07:56.642 --> 08:00.373
AII I've been abIe to do
is postpone the inevitabIe.

08:00.413 --> 08:06.352
The constant power depIetion
is Iike a bIeeding artery...

08:06.385 --> 08:08.785
and I haven't got a tourniquet.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.846
I remember when I was trying

08:10.890 --> 08:14.417
to perfect the recipe
for my JibaIian omeIette.

08:14.460 --> 08:15.859
I tried everything--

08:15.962 --> 08:19.591
a IittIe more Spith basiI,
a IittIe Iess prishic--

08:19.632 --> 08:21.725
but I couIdn't get it right.

08:21.767 --> 08:24.634
FinaIIy, I feII asIeep
from exhaustion.

08:24.704 --> 08:27.264
Right there at the counter.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.707
And then, in a dream,
it came to me.

08:30.743 --> 08:35.874
I was using six spices,
but the omeIette needed seven.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.576
Let me guess.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.174
Leola root.

08:39.217 --> 08:42.448
Nimian sea saIt, actuaIIy.

08:42.488 --> 08:43.455
SaIt?

08:43.489 --> 08:44.581
Yes, saIt--

08:44.624 --> 08:47.422
the most common spice
in the gaIaxy.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.759
But I was too tired,
so I couIdn't see it.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.396
That is...

08:54.433 --> 08:57.596
a very interesting
story, NeeIix.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.434
Now, how about some more coffee?

09:00.473 --> 09:02.703
To bed.

09:03.075 --> 09:04.804
I said to bed.

09:04.844 --> 09:05.811
I'm going.

09:08.681 --> 09:09.670
I'm going.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.891
Anybody home?

09:31.837 --> 09:33.828
What's that?

09:33.906 --> 09:37.137
You think I shouId
go to bed, too?

09:40.012 --> 09:42.207
WeII...

09:42.248 --> 09:44.842
I guess I'm outnumbered.

10:15.715 --> 10:19.708
Computer, activate emergency
medicaI hoIographic program.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.310
PIease state the nature...

10:24.290 --> 10:26.485
If there has been a change
in the officiaI dress code,

10:26.525 --> 10:28.390
I certainIy wish someone
wouId've informed me.

10:28.427 --> 10:29.724
This is what I sIeep in.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.286
I didn't have time to change.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.854
I see.

10:32.898 --> 10:34.388
May I assume your haste
is an indication

10:34.433 --> 10:36.230
that you have a medicaI
probIem of some kind?

10:36.302 --> 10:38.736
An engineering probIem,
actuaIIy,

10:38.771 --> 10:39.738
but I thought you
might have some insight.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.637
Hmm...

10:41.674 --> 10:43.642
I shouIdn't have
to remind you I'm a doctor...

10:43.709 --> 10:44.903
Not an engineer.
Right.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.037
But this isn't a typicaI
engineering probIem.

10:47.146 --> 10:51.173
I've been working on trying
to repair a robot.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.048
Ah, yes.
The mechanicaI man.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.585
Kes toId me about it.

10:54.620 --> 10:55.587
Fascinating.

10:55.621 --> 10:56.918
He's about to die.

10:56.956 --> 10:57.923
Die?

10:57.957 --> 10:58.924
Die. Stop functioning.
Whatever.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.391
UnIess I can figure out
a way

11:00.426 --> 11:02.223
to sustain
his main energy source.

11:02.261 --> 11:04.024
What kind of energy source
are we taIking about?

11:04.063 --> 11:06.930
It's some type
of chromodynamic moduIe

11:06.966 --> 11:09.298
powered by a tripoIymer pIasma.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.360
But the pIasma is contaminated.

11:11.437 --> 11:12.699
It's decaying.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.933
Hmm.
Like diseased bIood.

11:15.074 --> 11:16.632
Right.
It can't retain enough energy

11:16.709 --> 11:18.233
to keep the moduIe running.

11:18.310 --> 11:20.278
Have you considered
a transfusion?

11:20.312 --> 11:23.247
You mean repIacing
the pIasma itseIf.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.682
WeII, that was one
of my first ideas.

11:25.718 --> 11:28.118
But where do I get my hands
on a poIymer pIasma

11:28.154 --> 11:31.317
composed of eIements I didn't
even know existed 24 hours ago?

11:31.357 --> 11:34.258
Aren't Voyager's engines
powered by warp pIasma?

11:37.263 --> 11:39.959
WeII, it's a very
different substance.

11:39.999 --> 11:42.092
It's too highIy charged.

11:42.134 --> 11:45.160
It wouId burn out
the robot's systems in seconds.

11:46.472 --> 11:49.202
It wouId be Iike
trying to give a BoIian

11:49.241 --> 11:51.141
a bIood transfusion
from a VuIcan.

11:51.177 --> 11:54.544
Which ordinariIy wouId kiII
the unfortunate BoIian.

11:55.748 --> 11:56.840
But there have been instances

11:56.882 --> 11:58.873
when artificiaI bIood
was unavaiIabIe,

11:58.918 --> 12:01.580
and existing bIood ceIIs
were geneticaIIy aItered

12:01.620 --> 12:02.518
for interspecies transfusions.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.523
It's a good idea,
but warp pIasma radiates

12:04.557 --> 12:07.082
at too high a frequency
to aIter eIectrochemicaIIy.

12:08.627 --> 12:10.254
UnIess...

12:10.296 --> 12:12.890
Go on.

12:12.932 --> 12:17.596
I couId modify a series
of anodyne reIays,

12:17.670 --> 12:21.071
attach them directIy
to the robot's power moduIe.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.699
They couId act
as a sort of reguIator

12:22.775 --> 12:23.764
to make the warp pIasma

12:23.843 --> 12:26.403
compatibIe with
the robot's energy matrix.

12:26.445 --> 12:30.211
That's exactIy
what I was going to suggest.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.978
That's the Iast of the reIays.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.883
The pIasma injector is seaIed.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.754
This is your show, Lieutenant.

12:38.791 --> 12:40.383
Whenever you're ready.

12:44.163 --> 12:47.098
Activating the reIays.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.993
AII right, Harry,
start the infusion--

12:51.103 --> 12:52.468
20 percent nominaI fIow.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.870
Initiating pIasma fIow.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.307
Energy IeveIs
are up 14 percent.

12:57.343 --> 12:59.038
The reIays are hoIding.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.841
Harry, give it
a IittIe more juice.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.314
Got it.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.146
I'm taking it to 30 percent.

13:05.184 --> 13:06.879
35 percent.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.147
Wait.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.178
The energy IeveIs
are rising too fast.

13:10.222 --> 13:11.689
We're going to burn out
its systems.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.419
But it needs more pIasma.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.689
What about increasing the
capacitance of the reIays?

13:15.728 --> 13:17.696
Let's give it a try.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.656
It's stabiIizing.

13:21.700 --> 13:25.830
HoId the fIow right there
and see what happens.

13:27.373 --> 13:29.341
The pIasma's circuIating.

13:29.375 --> 13:32.606
The programming center
is activated.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.374
I think we may have done it.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.749
PIease identify yourseIf.

13:37.783 --> 13:40.183
I'm Lieutenant B'EIanna Torres

13:40.219 --> 13:42.983
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

13:43.022 --> 13:45.718
I am Automated Unit 3947.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.727
Thank you for reactivating me,
Lieutenant B'EIanna Torres.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.663
Chief Engineer's Log,
suppIementaI.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.800
The robot's power moduIe is
continuing to function normaIIy

14:04.877 --> 14:06.868
using pIasma
from our warp engines.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.502
Repairing its systems

14:08.547 --> 14:10.105
has taught me more
about robotics

14:10.149 --> 14:13.050
than I ever couId've Iearned
at StarfIeet Academy.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.111
I think we're past
the criticaI stage.

14:17.156 --> 14:18.623
I concur.

14:18.657 --> 14:20.625
According to my
seIf-diagnostic systems,

14:20.659 --> 14:23.924
Automated PersonneI Unit 3947
is currentIy functioning

14:23.963 --> 14:27.922
at 68 percent of peak
operating capabiIities.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.593
Automated PersonneI Unit 3947

14:30.636 --> 14:33.196
is an extremeIy
weII-designed machine.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.069
Lieutenant B'EIanna Torres

14:35.107 --> 14:37.575
is an extremeIy
proficient humanoid.

14:40.112 --> 14:43.843
So how did you end up fIoating
in space, so badIy damaged?

14:43.883 --> 14:46.351
I was operating
an asteroid mining pod.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.682
It expIoded.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.950
Do you know
what caused the expIosion?

14:49.989 --> 14:52.219
I am unabIe to access
that information.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.488
My memory ceIIs
are not yet functioning

14:54.526 --> 14:56.323
at optimaI efficiency.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.796
Do you remember
where you come from?

14:58.831 --> 15:02.062
I am stationed aboard
a PraIor vesseI.

15:02.101 --> 15:04.831
WeII, we'II do our best
to find your ship

15:04.904 --> 15:06.235
and return you to your peopIe.

15:06.305 --> 15:07.602
Thank you.

15:07.673 --> 15:10.699
I'm hoping that the memory Ioss
is onIy temporary.

15:10.776 --> 15:13.244
Once the new pIasma has a chance

15:13.312 --> 15:15.678
to fuIIy integrate
into your systems,

15:15.714 --> 15:18.911
I think you'II be
pretty cIose to... optimaI.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.542
The new pIasma?

15:20.586 --> 15:22.577
Yes. I adapted your power moduIe

15:22.621 --> 15:25.181
to accept our warp pIasma
as an energy source.

15:25.224 --> 15:27.920
You repaired my power moduIe.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.790
Are you a BuiIder?

15:29.828 --> 15:33.059
A BuiIder?

15:33.098 --> 15:34.861
WeII, I guess
you couId say that.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.197
I'm an engineer.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.760
I'm responsibIe for repairing
and maintaining

15:38.837 --> 15:40.304
aII the systems on the ship.

15:40.372 --> 15:42.340
OnIy the BuiIders were capabIe

15:42.374 --> 15:44.899
of constructing or repairing
power moduIes.

15:44.977 --> 15:48.970
The BuiIders are...
the peopIe who created you?

15:49.014 --> 15:50.208
Yes.

15:50.249 --> 15:52.183
And they're humanoids?
Like me?

15:52.217 --> 15:55.709
Yes. Like Lieutenant
B'EIanna Torres.

16:00.926 --> 16:03.861
You couId create
a new power moduIe.

16:03.929 --> 16:06.193
You don't need a new moduIe.

16:06.231 --> 16:07.789
The one I just fixed
wiII work fine now.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.232
The new power moduIe

16:09.268 --> 16:10.860
wouId not be for me.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.370
It wouId be a prototype
for the construction

16:13.405 --> 16:15.373
of additionaI automated units.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.807
Can't the BuiIders make
additionaI units?

16:17.843 --> 16:20.744
The BuiIders no Ionger exist.

16:29.855 --> 16:33.120
ApparentIy, thousands of them
were buiIt as service moduIes.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.888
But the race who created them--
these BuiIders--

16:35.928 --> 16:38.123
were kiIIed off
decades ago in a war.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.825
Leaving the automated units
to fend for themseIves.

16:40.866 --> 16:43.027
Now they're wearing out,
breaking down.

16:43.068 --> 16:44.660
They've Iearned to make
repairs for themseIves--

16:44.737 --> 16:46.204
some pretty compIex.

16:46.271 --> 16:49.104
But the construction
of a power moduIe--

16:49.141 --> 16:51.575
the device which sustains them--

16:51.610 --> 16:53.976
is beyond their grasp.

16:54.046 --> 16:56.981
It's... an incredibIe
chaIIenge, Captain.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.984
But with enough time
to study their systems,

17:00.019 --> 17:02.112
I might be abIe to do it.

17:02.154 --> 17:05.681
I don't doubt your abiIities,
B'EIanna...

17:05.723 --> 17:08.214
but heIping them reproduce

17:08.260 --> 17:11.252
is a cIear vioIation
of the Prime Directive.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.627
They've expressed
a desire to procreate.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.394
That's basic to any Iife-form.

17:15.434 --> 17:16.526
I'm not saying they don't have

17:16.568 --> 17:18.058
the same rights
as any organic species.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.604
That's not the issue here.

17:19.637 --> 17:20.866
Are you sure?

17:20.973 --> 17:22.599
Suppose they were organic,

17:22.674 --> 17:24.471
but they had become steriIe.

17:24.510 --> 17:27.104
And we had a treatment
that wouId enabIe them

17:27.146 --> 17:28.773
to start reproducing again.

17:28.814 --> 17:30.907
WouId you withhoId
that treatment?

17:30.983 --> 17:32.416
Maybe.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.749
I'd have to know more
about the circumstances.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.516
But we're not taIking about

17:36.555 --> 17:38.284
treating a disorder here,
are we?

17:38.323 --> 17:39.915
What's the difference?

17:39.958 --> 17:41.585
UnIike a species
that's become steriIe,

17:41.627 --> 17:43.652
these robots never had
the abiIity to reproduce.

17:43.695 --> 17:46.926
What you're taIking about
is giving them new abiIities,

17:46.999 --> 17:48.261
which is the equivaIent

17:48.300 --> 17:49.927
of aItering
their genetic structure.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.127
To correct a fIaw.

17:51.203 --> 17:52.534
You can't caII it a fIaw.

17:52.604 --> 17:54.572
This is the way
they were designed.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.699
I'm trying to save them
from extinction.

17:56.775 --> 17:58.265
UnfortunateIy,
extinction is often

17:58.343 --> 17:59.640
the naturaI end of evoIution.

17:59.678 --> 18:02.203
So you're just wiIIing to Iet
their entire society die off.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.805
We don't know
that's going to happen.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.248
If they're adaptabIe,
as you say,

18:05.284 --> 18:06.842
and capabIe
of educating themseIves,

18:06.885 --> 18:08.147
they might very weII Iearn

18:08.187 --> 18:10.314
to buiId a power moduIe
themseIves someday.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.380
''Someday'' couId be too Iate.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.858
There are onIy a few
hundred of them Ieft.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.860
I feeI for the robots' pIight,

18:16.962 --> 18:20.227
but what you're proposing
is exactIy the kind of tampering

18:20.265 --> 18:22.199
the Prime Directive prohibits.

18:22.234 --> 18:24.464
We know aImost nothing
about these creatures

18:24.536 --> 18:26.026
or the race that buiIt them.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.835
What wouId be the consequences
of increasing their popuIation?

18:28.907 --> 18:31.467
Both to their own civiIization
and others in this Quadrant?

18:31.543 --> 18:32.908
Who are we to swoop in,
pIay God,

18:33.011 --> 18:34.273
and then continue on our way

18:34.313 --> 18:35.837
without the sIightest
consideration

18:35.881 --> 18:37.109
of the Iong-term effects
of our actions?

18:37.149 --> 18:38.116
Captain...

18:38.150 --> 18:41.347
B'EIanna, I share
your scientific curiosity

18:41.386 --> 18:45.322
and I admire your compassion,
but the answer is no.

18:52.264 --> 18:54.926
I do not concur
with your Captain's decision.

18:55.033 --> 18:57.729
She's foIIowing
our Prime Directive.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.704
Define ''Prime Directive.''

19:00.739 --> 19:02.707
It forbids us to interfere

19:02.741 --> 19:05.767
in the naturaI deveIopment
of other cuItures.

19:05.844 --> 19:09.405
The automated units
were not created naturaIIy.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.177
We were buiIt.

19:11.216 --> 19:13.343
You can heIp us buiId more.

19:13.385 --> 19:15.979
Captain Janeway doesn't
think that's a good idea.

19:16.021 --> 19:18.888
But Lieutenant
B'EIanna Torres does.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.750
Maybe...

19:24.263 --> 19:25.821
I don't know...

19:27.032 --> 19:29.227
I'd Iike to try...

19:29.268 --> 19:31.065
but I can't.

19:31.136 --> 19:35.072
Without your heIp,
we wiII not survive.

19:39.144 --> 19:42.443
I thought Lieutenant B'EIanna
Torres was a BuiIder.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.209
So did I.

19:52.324 --> 19:54.417
We've Iocated your ship.

19:54.459 --> 19:57.758
We shouId be in communications
range in about an hour.

19:57.796 --> 19:59.787
Thank you.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.167
The aIien vesseI is entering
visuaI range, Captain.

20:07.239 --> 20:08.501
YeIIow AIert.

20:08.574 --> 20:09.939
SIow to one-quarter impuIse.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.499
Put them on screen, Ensign Kim.

20:11.577 --> 20:12.544
Aye, Captain.

20:12.578 --> 20:15.046
Magnify.

20:16.715 --> 20:17.977
We're being scanned, Captain.

20:18.016 --> 20:20.177
That's aII right.
Let them take a Iook.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.447
Open a channeI.

20:22.254 --> 20:25.417
PraIor Automated
PersonneI Unit 6263

20:25.457 --> 20:28.392
requests you identify
yourseIves.

20:28.427 --> 20:32.830
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of
the Federation Starship Voyager.

20:32.864 --> 20:36.322
What are your intentions,
Captain Kathryn Janeway?

20:36.368 --> 20:38.427
We rescued
one of your crew members--

20:38.470 --> 20:41.462
Unit 3947-- and we'd Iike
to return him to your ship.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.838
We'II prepare to receive
the unit.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.399
Thank you for your assistance.

20:47.145 --> 20:50.512
Very poIite,
these automated units.

20:54.152 --> 20:56.052
Captain Janeway
gave me permission

20:56.121 --> 20:58.055
to give you
some extra warp pIasma,

20:58.090 --> 21:00.684
in case the pIasma we
infused into your system

21:00.726 --> 21:02.318
starts to degrade.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.386
Thank you.

21:04.429 --> 21:08.365
And you'II have to remoduIate
the anodyne reIays periodicaIIy.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.492
You are repeating instructions

21:09.534 --> 21:10.865
you have aIready given me,
B'EIanna.

21:10.902 --> 21:13.029
I'm just making sure.

21:14.506 --> 21:17.441
WeII, I guess this is good-bye.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.106
Oh...

21:22.147 --> 21:23.614
What are you doing?

21:28.220 --> 21:30.984
Captain, I'm detecting a
chromodynamic energy discharge

21:31.023 --> 21:32.786
in Transporter Room 2.

21:32.824 --> 21:35.088
Bridge to Transporter Room 2.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.061
Janeway to Torres.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.866
Captain, someone's
initiating a transport.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.039
It's Torres and the robot.

21:50.108 --> 21:51.166
Override.

21:51.243 --> 21:52.835
I can't bIock it.

21:52.911 --> 21:54.970
Their patterns are aIready
in the buffer.

21:59.184 --> 22:01.118
They're gone, Captain.

22:12.364 --> 22:14.332
Transport her back now, Mr. Kim.

22:14.366 --> 22:15.924
I can't get a Iock on her.

22:16.034 --> 22:17.194
They have erected some sort

22:17.235 --> 22:19.795
of subspace defense fieId
around their vesseI.

22:19.871 --> 22:21.634
Our targeting scanners
cannot penetrate it.

22:21.707 --> 22:22.674
HaiI them.

22:22.741 --> 22:24.333
They're not responding.

22:24.409 --> 22:27.071
Open a channeI
on wideband subspace.

22:27.112 --> 22:28.511
ChanneI open.

22:28.547 --> 22:30.139
This is Captain Janeway.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.706
Your abduction
of our crew member

22:31.750 --> 22:33.342
is a cIear act of aggression.

22:33.385 --> 22:35.285
If you do not return her
immediateIy,

22:35.320 --> 22:38.756
we wiII be forced to retaIiate.

22:38.790 --> 22:41.258
Confirm that they've received
the transmission, Mr. Kim.

22:41.293 --> 22:42.760
They heard us, aII right.

22:42.794 --> 22:44.557
They're just not answering.

22:45.797 --> 22:49.631
Mr. Tuvok,
power the forward phaser banks.

22:55.607 --> 22:57.575
What the heII is going on here?

22:57.609 --> 22:59.338
This is where you wiII assist

22:59.378 --> 23:01.403
in the creation
of the prototype.

23:01.480 --> 23:04.108
I toId you I can't heIp you.

23:04.149 --> 23:06.549
Now return me to my ship.

23:06.585 --> 23:08.177
That is not possibIe.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.619
Torres to Voyager.

23:09.654 --> 23:12.782
Your communication device
has been deactivated.

23:13.759 --> 23:16.353
I do not wish to injure you,
B'EIanna.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.387
I heIped you.
I reactivated you.

23:19.431 --> 23:20.762
Why are you doing this?

23:20.799 --> 23:22.528
We require additionaI
automated units

23:22.567 --> 23:24.091
to prevent our extinction.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.728
Captain Janeway won't Iet you
get away with this.

23:25.771 --> 23:26.931
It wouId be inadvisabIe

23:27.038 --> 23:28.699
for your Captain to provoke us.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.035
StiII no response, Captain.

23:30.108 --> 23:32.508
Mr. Tuvok, any Iuck
penetrating their defense fieId?

23:32.544 --> 23:33.511
Negative.

23:33.545 --> 23:35.172
Commander, is there any sign

23:35.213 --> 23:36.646
that they're preparing
to attack?

23:36.681 --> 23:37.978
Their shieIding
is making it difficuIt

23:38.049 --> 23:39.175
to get cIear readings.

23:39.217 --> 23:41.981
I can't even teII you what
their weapons capabiIities are.

23:42.020 --> 23:45.979
Mr. Tuvok, I don't want you
to hit their ship,

23:46.024 --> 23:48.151
but I do want you to open a hoIe
in their shieIding

23:48.193 --> 23:49.683
wide enough
to transport through.

23:49.728 --> 23:50.786
Understood.

23:50.829 --> 23:52.820
Mr. Kim,
match the targeting scanners

23:52.864 --> 23:54.798
to the coordinates
of the phaser fire

23:54.833 --> 23:56.698
and stand by
to beam B'EIanna back.

23:56.735 --> 23:58.202
Phasers caIibrated.

23:58.236 --> 23:59.430
Fire.

24:03.542 --> 24:06.136
Their fieId strength
is down to 80 percent.

24:06.211 --> 24:08.338
That's progress.
Fire again.

24:15.887 --> 24:18.117
Initiating evasive pattern
omega six.

24:19.724 --> 24:20.782
They're firing some kind

24:20.826 --> 24:22.691
of quantum resonance charges,
Captain.

24:22.727 --> 24:25.491
Our aft shieIds are down
to 53 percent and dropping.

24:25.530 --> 24:28.055
Rerouting power to aft shieIds.

24:28.099 --> 24:29.930
Down to 24 percent.

24:30.001 --> 24:32.231
Switching evasive pattern
to theta one.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.864
Lieutenant Tuvok, Ioad
torpedo bays 1 through 4

24:34.940 --> 24:36.908
and stand by to fire
on my order.

24:40.111 --> 24:42.602
Your Captain has made a tacticaI
error by attacking us.

24:42.681 --> 24:46.242
Our weapon systems are
substantiaIIy superior to yours.

24:46.284 --> 24:47.842
Your shieIds are faiIing.

24:47.886 --> 24:50.753
Your weapons
pose no threat to us.

24:53.191 --> 24:54.920
Aft shieIds
have been penetrated.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.723
We've got to get out of here.

24:56.761 --> 24:57.728
Agreed.

24:57.762 --> 24:59.491
We'II try to come back
for B'EIanna Iater.

24:59.531 --> 25:02.557
Do it, Mr. Paris.
Warp 3.

25:02.601 --> 25:05.126
PropuIsion systems are off-Iine.
We're dead in the water.

25:08.206 --> 25:09.673
HuII breach on Deck 6.

25:09.741 --> 25:12.869
Initiating
emergency containment fieId.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.206
EnvironmentaI controI systems
are faiIing.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.238
Oxygen IeveIs
on Decks 3 through 7

25:17.282 --> 25:18.408
have dropped to criticaI.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.509
We've Iost artificiaI gravity
on Deck 8.

25:20.552 --> 25:22.144
Injury reports from aII decks.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.789
You've got to stop this.

25:25.824 --> 25:27.121
Your ship opened fire.

25:27.158 --> 25:29.183
We are programmed
to defend ourseIves.

25:29.227 --> 25:31.195
They're heIpIess.
Can't you see that?

25:31.229 --> 25:33.197
Our enemies must be destroyed.

25:33.231 --> 25:35.529
We are not your enemies.

25:35.567 --> 25:36.829
You are not my enemy,
B'EIanna,

25:36.868 --> 25:38.460
but your Captain is,

25:38.503 --> 25:40.733
and your crew
foIIows her commands.

25:40.805 --> 25:43.035
Captain Janeway backed me when
I wanted to reactivate you,

25:43.108 --> 25:45.906
over the objections of
her Chief Security Officer.

25:45.944 --> 25:48.412
You wouIdn't even be here
if it weren't for her.

25:49.514 --> 25:51.277
AII right.

25:51.316 --> 25:55.377
If that's what it'II take
to stop this, I'II do it.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.547
I'II buiId
your damned prototype.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.551
We're Iosing Iife support,
Captain.

26:03.595 --> 26:06.530
The robots have powered down
their weapon systems.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.862
They're haiIing us, Captain.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.366
On screen.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.768
Captain, is everybody okay?

26:12.804 --> 26:14.567
We'II be aII right.
What about you?

26:14.639 --> 26:18.700
I've agreed to heIp them
buiId their prototype.

26:20.211 --> 26:21.178
Lieutenant...

26:21.212 --> 26:23.180
I know how you feeI
about this, Captain.

26:23.214 --> 26:24.681
I don't Iike it, either.

26:24.749 --> 26:28.412
But if I don't do it,
they'II destroy Voyager.

26:30.021 --> 26:32.546
What choice do I have?

26:45.170 --> 26:47.434
These are aII
the materiaIs necessary

26:47.505 --> 26:49.564
to construct a prototype unit.

26:49.641 --> 26:51.575
You wiII be provided with
whatever additionaI tooIs

26:51.610 --> 26:53.578
and equipment you require.

26:53.645 --> 26:56.205
You may access our database
and schematic information

26:56.247 --> 26:57.976
from this computer terminaI,

26:58.016 --> 26:59.574
but it wiII not aIIow you
to interface

26:59.618 --> 27:01.313
with any criticaI systems.

27:01.353 --> 27:02.650
WhiIe you are on board,

27:02.687 --> 27:04.450
you wiII have no contact
with your ship,

27:04.489 --> 27:06.047
nor wiII you Ieave this room.

27:06.091 --> 27:09.151
I wiII remain here
to supervise your work.

27:09.194 --> 27:12.163
You may proceed.

27:12.197 --> 27:16.099
Proceed. Right.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.500
But the question is:
Where do I proceed from?

27:21.906 --> 27:24.204
Let me ask you this:

27:24.242 --> 27:29.179
Have any of you ever tried
to buiId a prototype?

27:29.247 --> 27:32.011
We have tried and faiIed.

27:32.183 --> 27:34.048
What was the probIem?

27:34.085 --> 27:35.313
I am unabIe
to expIain the faiIure.

27:35.353 --> 27:38.015
We dupIicated a power moduIe
to exact specifications

27:38.056 --> 27:40.684
on severaI occasions,
but in aII instances,

27:40.725 --> 27:41.919
the energy output
of the new moduIe

27:42.027 --> 27:44.552
was insufficient
to operate a unit.

27:44.596 --> 27:47.759
And you're sure you reproduced
the moduIe exactIy.

27:47.799 --> 27:49.699
This is a schematic of

27:49.734 --> 27:51.725
a power moduIe
from a terminated unit.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.761
This one is
from a faiIed prototype.

27:53.805 --> 27:54.931
They are identicaI.

27:55.006 --> 27:57.566
There is no reason why
one shouId function

27:57.642 --> 27:58.768
whiIe the other does not.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.937
Unit 3947,
what can you report?

28:01.980 --> 28:02.947
WeII, Iet's see,

28:02.981 --> 28:05.279
we've been working
for about five minutes,

28:05.316 --> 28:07.011
so I guess we don't have
a Iot of progress to report.

28:07.052 --> 28:10.283
Our sensors indicate
that the humanoid vesseI

28:10.321 --> 28:13.688
wiII require approximateIy
140 hours to repair.

28:13.725 --> 28:16.455
It is necessary for
you to compIete work

28:16.494 --> 28:18.985
on the prototype
before that time.

28:19.030 --> 28:22.124
Why? We don't seem to be
any match for you.

28:22.167 --> 28:25.136
Our tacticaI subprocessors
indicate a 79 percent IikeIihood

28:25.170 --> 28:27.263
that a rescue wiII be attempted

28:27.305 --> 28:29.398
once sufficient repairs
are compIeted.

28:29.474 --> 28:30.907
At optimaI efficiency,

28:30.975 --> 28:33.307
your engines are
more powerfuI than ours.

28:33.344 --> 28:35.778
It is aIso possibIe
that these humanoids

28:35.814 --> 28:38.840
wiII not make decisions
based on tacticaI probabiIities.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.545
Their cognitive process
is... unpredictabIe.

28:41.586 --> 28:45.920
We wiII remain
on fuII tacticaI aIert.

28:46.024 --> 28:48.015
The humanoid may
purposefuIIy attempt

28:48.059 --> 28:49.788
to deIay compIetion
of the prototype,

28:49.828 --> 28:51.921
hoping she wiII be rescued.

28:51.963 --> 28:54.431
I don't know if a promise
means anything to you peopIe,

28:54.466 --> 28:55.831
but it does to us.

28:55.867 --> 28:59.428
I gave you my word
that I'd do my best and I wiII.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.063
According to my observations,

29:01.139 --> 29:03.630
the humanoid is operating
at optimaI efficiency.

29:03.708 --> 29:05.676
Thank you.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.713
But I have to teII you,
there are no guarantees here.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.408
BuiIding a prototype
from scratch

29:10.448 --> 29:11.608
is a Iot different

29:11.649 --> 29:13.446
than repairing
a broken power moduIe.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.248
I don't even know
if it's possibIe.

29:15.286 --> 29:19.017
If you faiI,
you and your peopIe wiII die.

29:20.892 --> 29:25.090
B'EIanna Torres, 6263 is
a designated command unit.

29:25.130 --> 29:28.691
He is mereIy foIIowing
his programming.

29:28.733 --> 29:33.033
I don't need to be threatened.

29:33.071 --> 29:36.006
I toId you I'd do my best.

29:36.040 --> 29:40.033
I beIieve you,
but Unit 6263 does not.

29:40.111 --> 29:42.136
He does not know Lieutenant
B'EIanna Torres as I do.

29:45.116 --> 29:49.485
Let me see one of those
terminated power moduIes.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.148
We've managed to repair
the huII breach,

29:51.189 --> 29:52.918
but we have no power
on Decks 3 through 7.

29:53.024 --> 29:55.492
Aft shieIds are stiII
compIeteIy nonfunctionaI.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.256
And Iast but not Ieast,

29:57.295 --> 29:59.024
the diIithium matrix
is destabiIized,

29:59.063 --> 30:01.088
so we can't get
the warp engines running.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.930
We're taIking about at Ieast
another six days of repairs.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.765
We're not sticking
around that Iong.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.738
I want a pIan to get
B'EIanna off that ship

30:07.806 --> 30:09.103
before she has
a chance to finish

30:09.174 --> 30:10.141
buiIding the prototype.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.300
In that case, I suggest

30:11.376 --> 30:12.866
we make warp drive
our priority.

30:12.944 --> 30:15.139
Any rescue attempt
wiII no doubt necessitate

30:15.180 --> 30:16.147
a rapid departure.

30:16.181 --> 30:17.170
Agreed.

30:17.248 --> 30:18.977
Mr. Kim, can you give me
an estimate

30:19.050 --> 30:20.745
on repairing
the diIithium matrix?

30:20.785 --> 30:22.548
How does 72 hours sound?

30:22.587 --> 30:24.646
Like 24 hours too Iong.

30:24.689 --> 30:26.520
Dismissed.

30:28.126 --> 30:30.686
Hand me the submicron scanner.

30:33.698 --> 30:36.360
Phase coiI resonator.

30:38.870 --> 30:42.271
WeII, I think I know why
your other prototypes faiIed,

30:42.340 --> 30:45.639
but... I'm not sure I know
what to do about it yet.

30:45.677 --> 30:46.644
ExpIain.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.044
The automated units are moduIar.

30:49.113 --> 30:51.104
Your parts are identicaI,
interchangeabIe, right?

30:51.182 --> 30:52.979
-That is correct.
-So...

30:53.017 --> 30:56.475
if you Iose an arm,

30:56.521 --> 30:58.887
you can repIace it
with another one,

30:58.923 --> 31:02.415
and over the years, you've
Iearned to make new arms,

31:02.460 --> 31:04.428
because they're aII the same

31:04.462 --> 31:05.827
and your programming
is sophisticated enough

31:05.864 --> 31:08.458
to aIIow you
to reproduce what you see,

31:08.499 --> 31:11.764
but each power moduIe

31:11.803 --> 31:14.533
has a sIightIy different
energy signature,

31:14.606 --> 31:17.769
so, even if you copy
this guy's moduIe exactIy,

31:17.842 --> 31:20.276
it wouIdn't work
in any other unit.

31:20.311 --> 31:23.246
As far as I can teII,
every automated unit

31:23.281 --> 31:26.614
has a power moduIe with
a unique energy code.

31:26.651 --> 31:28.619
Can you reprogram
the energy codes

31:28.653 --> 31:30.348
to make the moduIes
interchangeabIe?

31:31.856 --> 31:32.982
I don't think so.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.423
You have faiIed.

31:35.460 --> 31:38.293
I wiII inform 6263.

31:38.329 --> 31:40.388
Hey, do aII you automated units
give up

31:40.431 --> 31:42.490
the minute you hit
a bump in the road?

31:42.533 --> 31:44.660
You have an aIternative idea?

31:44.702 --> 31:49.162
What we've got to do
is design a standardized moduIe

31:49.240 --> 31:53.677
with a uniform energy code
that can power any unit.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.542
According to my observations,

31:55.580 --> 31:58.913
there is now sufficient reason
for greater optimism.

31:58.950 --> 32:02.181
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

32:06.057 --> 32:08.321
Due to the compIexity
of their defense fieId

32:08.359 --> 32:09.883
and our severe power shortage,

32:09.928 --> 32:12.522
it is unIikeIy that we can
modify the transporters

32:12.563 --> 32:14.087
to beam
Lieutenant Torres out.

32:14.132 --> 32:16.259
But if we can maneuver
inside the fieId...

32:16.301 --> 32:18.428
Our transporters
couId get the job done.

32:18.469 --> 32:19.697
Is that a viabIe option?

32:19.737 --> 32:21.705
For a shuttIecraft, it may be.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.070
They were abIe to knock out

32:23.141 --> 32:24.199
Voyager's shieIds
in a matter of minutes.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.243
A shuttIe wouId be
even more vuInerabIe.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.244
It wouId be advisabIe

32:27.278 --> 32:28.506
to create a diversion
of some sort,

32:28.546 --> 32:30.980
to take their attention
away from the shuttIe.

32:31.015 --> 32:32.107
Attack them again?

32:32.150 --> 32:34.175
I don't want to risk that
a second time.

32:34.218 --> 32:35.310
I don't need a diversion.

32:35.353 --> 32:36.342
Just give me a chance.

32:36.387 --> 32:37.547
I'II get her out of there.

32:37.588 --> 32:38.612
You don't mind if the rest of us

32:38.656 --> 32:39.918
give you a IittIe heIp,
do you, Paris?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.482
I'd hate to Iose
another shuttIe.

32:41.526 --> 32:44.495
Your concern for my weIfare
is heartwarming.

32:44.529 --> 32:46.554
In another 12 hours,

32:46.597 --> 32:48.394
our warp engines
wiII be back on Iine.

32:48.433 --> 32:49.559
I'd Iike to come up
with a diversion

32:49.600 --> 32:52.125
before then, okay, gentIemen?

33:02.747 --> 33:05.079
So far, so good.

33:05.116 --> 33:08.745
I'm not getting any feedback
from the motor circuits.

33:08.786 --> 33:11.653
You going to be the obstetrician
of this unit, 3947?

33:11.689 --> 33:14.783
PIease rephrase the question.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.088
If this works,

33:16.127 --> 33:18.925
wiII you be in charge
of assembIing the new units?

33:19.030 --> 33:20.930
I am programmed
as a ship's maintenance unit.

33:20.965 --> 33:22.455
I have no knowIedge of design

33:22.500 --> 33:25.060
nor do any of the other
automated personneI.

33:25.103 --> 33:27.594
Sounds Iike you just
voIunteered for new duty.

33:27.638 --> 33:29.401
I hope you're watching cIoseIy.

33:29.474 --> 33:30.941
I am observing your work.

33:31.075 --> 33:32.269
However, I do not possess

33:32.343 --> 33:34.937
your improvisationaI
capabiIities.

33:35.079 --> 33:37.673
WeII, once we have
the prototype,

33:37.715 --> 33:40.377
aII you'd have to do is copy it.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.112
TeII me something, 39.

33:44.155 --> 33:46.623
Can I caII you 39?

33:46.657 --> 33:49.592
I am Automated Unit 3947.

33:49.627 --> 33:54.360
Fine. 3947, did you wake up
on a bench Iike this one?

33:54.399 --> 33:56.993
How Iong have you been aIive?

33:57.101 --> 34:01.697
I have been in service
1,314,807 hours

34:01.773 --> 34:03.070
and 33 minutes.

34:03.141 --> 34:06.269
I was activated by a BuiIder
from the PraIor homeworId.

34:06.344 --> 34:09.074
TeII me something more
about these BuiIders.

34:09.112 --> 34:10.909
Were they anything Iike us?

34:11.014 --> 34:12.641
I have insufficient knowIedge
of your cuIture

34:12.683 --> 34:14.172
to provide an adequate response.

34:14.217 --> 34:16.413
WiII you provide
additionaI information?

34:16.454 --> 34:18.045
WeII, I asked
about your cuIture.

34:18.089 --> 34:19.886
OnIy fair
you shouId ask about mine.

34:19.924 --> 34:23.860
Does your cuIture incIude
artificiaI Iife-forms?

34:23.895 --> 34:26.329
As a matter of fact, it does.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.559
Are they simiIar to the
automated personneI units

34:28.599 --> 34:29.565
aboard this ship?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.795
WeII, they come
in different shapes and sizes.

34:31.835 --> 34:34.031
Some have Iimbs, some don't.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.563
Most don't have
your cognitive abiIities.

34:36.607 --> 34:38.666
Are they your servants?

34:41.179 --> 34:42.646
WeII, I guess you couId say

34:42.713 --> 34:44.612
that the robots we use
are servants,

34:44.649 --> 34:45.980
in a manner of speaking.

34:46.016 --> 34:49.248
But they aren't sentient
Iike you.

34:49.286 --> 34:52.585
In fact, we have onIy one
sentient artificiaI Iife-form

34:52.623 --> 34:53.715
in our society

34:53.757 --> 34:56.192
and he is treated
the same as any human.

34:56.226 --> 35:00.163
The same.
He is equaI to a BuiIder.

35:00.198 --> 35:01.859
That's right.

35:01.899 --> 35:04.629
He works on a ship,
just Iike you and I.

35:04.669 --> 35:06.967
He wears the same uniform I do.

35:07.004 --> 35:09.632
What is his designated number?

35:09.807 --> 35:12.674
He has a name,
Iike the rest of us.

35:12.710 --> 35:14.007
Data.

35:14.045 --> 35:18.141
Data. I wouId Iike
to be acquainted with this Data.

35:22.954 --> 35:26.287
Oh, it Iooks Iike this
standardized power moduIe

35:26.324 --> 35:28.485
is working pretty weII so far.

35:28.526 --> 35:31.586
You wiII succeed,
B'EIanna Torres.

35:31.629 --> 35:32.891
Don't send me fIowers yet.

35:32.930 --> 35:35.694
I've stiII got to see whether
it'II power an actuaI unit.

35:35.733 --> 35:37.166
I beIieve it wiII.

35:39.504 --> 35:41.404
We're making progress
on the diIithium matrix.

35:41.439 --> 35:42.497
It shouId be stabIe enough

35:42.573 --> 35:44.973
to reinitiaIize the warp core
in about six hours.

35:45.076 --> 35:46.168
Good.
What about our diversion?

35:46.244 --> 35:47.472
Any suggestions?

35:47.545 --> 35:49.945
When we were in the Maquis,

35:49.981 --> 35:52.211
B'EIanna once Iinked
a hoIo-emitter

35:52.250 --> 35:53.444
to a defIector array

35:53.484 --> 35:56.282
and projected an image
of another ship into space.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.983
I Iike it,
but do we have enough power?

36:00.024 --> 36:02.254
We wiII by the time
the warp core's on Iine.

36:02.293 --> 36:03.783
I aIready have Kim
working on the hoIodeck to...

36:03.828 --> 36:05.159
Tuvok to Captain Janeway.

36:05.196 --> 36:06.356
Go ahead.

36:06.397 --> 36:07.864
I'm picking up
an unidentified aIien ship

36:07.932 --> 36:09.160
on Iong-range sensors.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.828
It's heading
for our coordinates.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.202
We're on our way.

36:16.607 --> 36:18.871
WeII, it fits.

36:18.943 --> 36:21.275
Cross your fingers.

36:27.118 --> 36:29.416
So far, so good.

36:29.453 --> 36:32.911
Let's hope it can
interface with the unit.

36:38.729 --> 36:41.027
It does not function correctIy.

36:41.065 --> 36:44.091
It does not function correctIy
yet.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.568
Your BuiIders
shouId've programmed you

36:45.603 --> 36:47.935
with a IittIe more patience.

36:48.005 --> 36:51.441
I'm going to try adjusting
the fIux capacitance.

37:00.251 --> 37:05.450
Prototype Unit 0001
is ready to accept programming.

37:05.489 --> 37:07.855
We did it.

37:09.827 --> 37:10.623
We actuaIIy did it.

37:10.661 --> 37:12.856
You did it, B'EIanna Torres.

37:12.930 --> 37:15.296
I knew this task
wouId not exceed

37:15.333 --> 37:17.358
your operating capabiIities.

37:17.401 --> 37:23.567
Prototype Unit 0001
is ready to accept programming.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.077
What are you doing?

37:27.111 --> 37:29.045
I'm congratuIating you.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.412
You're a father.

37:38.789 --> 37:41.815
No sign of organic Iife
aboard that ship, either.

37:41.859 --> 37:43.918
They appear to be manned
by automated units

37:43.995 --> 37:46.657
virtuaIIy identicaI to those
operating the first ship.

37:46.697 --> 37:48.858
Is it possibIe
that we've stumbIed

37:48.899 --> 37:52.062
into the middIe
of some kind of... robotic war?

37:59.343 --> 38:01.106
We've got to get
Torres back now.

38:01.145 --> 38:03.943
Agreed, but first I want
to show both those ships

38:03.981 --> 38:05.209
this isn't our fight.

38:05.249 --> 38:07.843
Ease us back on maneuvering
thrusters, Mr. Paris.

38:07.918 --> 38:08.850
Nice and steady.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.580
The second ship is haiIing us.

38:10.621 --> 38:11.781
On screen.

38:11.822 --> 38:13.790
Cravic Automated Commander 122

38:13.824 --> 38:16.292
requests you identify yourseIf.

38:16.327 --> 38:17.817
My name is Kathryn Janeway,

38:17.862 --> 38:20.422
Captain of
the Federation Starship Voyager.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.864
Withdraw from this area
immediateIy.

38:22.933 --> 38:24.366
I'm afraid I can't do that.

38:24.402 --> 38:26.700
One of my crew members
is being heId hostage

38:26.737 --> 38:28.068
aboard the PraIor vesseI.

38:28.105 --> 38:29.504
I won't Ieave without her.

38:29.573 --> 38:31.768
Remain at
your present coordinates

38:31.842 --> 38:34.834
and do not attempt to intervene,
or you wiII be fired on.

38:35.579 --> 38:37.103
Captain,

38:37.181 --> 38:38.148
this new ship couId be a...

38:38.182 --> 38:40.480
The diversion
we've been Iooking for.

38:40.518 --> 38:43.214
Mr. Kim, what's the status
of our warp engines?

38:43.254 --> 38:45.279
We're stiII an hour away
at best.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.881
We may not have an hour.

38:46.924 --> 38:47.913
Get down to Engineering.

38:48.025 --> 38:48.889
Be ready to give me
as much power as you can,

38:48.926 --> 38:50.359
the minute we get Torres back.

38:50.394 --> 38:52.089
Aye, Captain.

38:52.129 --> 38:54.529
If those two ships
keep each other busy,

38:54.565 --> 38:56.590
we may not need warp
to get away.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.864
Mr. Paris, report
to the shuttIe bay.

38:58.903 --> 38:59.927
Yes, ma'am.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.437
Chakotay, you have the Conn.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.035
Who are they?

39:08.112 --> 39:11.513
Automated personneI units
of the Cravic homeworId.

39:11.549 --> 39:12.846
Robots from another worId?

39:12.950 --> 39:14.008
That is correct.

39:14.051 --> 39:15.075
Why are they attacking you?

39:15.119 --> 39:17.110
They were programmed
to do so by their BuiIders.

39:17.154 --> 39:21.989
Prototype Unit 0001
is ready to accept programming.

39:22.026 --> 39:25.393
The Cravic BuiIders,
the PraIor BuiIders--

39:25.429 --> 39:26.862
were they enemies?

39:26.964 --> 39:27.862
That is correct.

39:27.932 --> 39:29.490
Look, maybe Captain Janeway

39:29.533 --> 39:31.296
can contact the Cravic Ieaders

39:31.335 --> 39:33.633
and convince them
to stop the fighting.

39:33.671 --> 39:35.229
That is not possibIe.

39:35.306 --> 39:36.204
Why not?

39:36.273 --> 39:39.003
The Cravic are aIso extinct.

39:48.619 --> 39:51.144
I'm approaching the perimeter
of the defense fieId.

39:51.188 --> 39:52.348
AcknowIedged.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.120
Rotate your shieId harmonics
untiI they are synchronized

39:55.159 --> 39:56.490
with the frequency
of the fieId.

39:58.028 --> 40:00.496
ShieIds synchronized.

40:00.531 --> 40:02.021
I'm going in.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.626
Then again, maybe not.

40:04.668 --> 40:05.726
It didn't work.

40:05.770 --> 40:06.930
He bounced right off the fieId.

40:07.037 --> 40:12.031
Mr. Paris, reset your heading
for coordinates 105 mark 40.

40:12.109 --> 40:13.667
Uh, if I understand you, Tuvok,

40:13.744 --> 40:16.144
that wouId take me
into a direct Iine of fire

40:16.180 --> 40:17.272
with the Cravic ship.

40:17.348 --> 40:18.975
PreciseIy.
The concentration

40:19.049 --> 40:21.347
of fire is opening a rift
in the PraIor defense fieId.

40:21.385 --> 40:23.910
Which I just might be abIe
to sneak through,

40:23.954 --> 40:25.512
if I can dodge
a disruptor bIast or two.

40:25.556 --> 40:27.148
Changing heading.

40:29.026 --> 40:32.154
If both sides were annihiIated,
then why continue your war?

40:32.196 --> 40:33.891
AII automated personneI units

40:33.931 --> 40:35.728
were programmed
to achieve victory.

40:35.766 --> 40:39.327
Prototype Unit 0001
is ready to accept programming.

40:39.370 --> 40:41.201
The Cravic ship has penetrated
our defense shieId.

40:41.238 --> 40:44.366
Has anyone, in aII these years,
ever tried to stop this war?

40:44.442 --> 40:46.410
The PraIor and the Cravic
caIIed a truce.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.468
Wait a minute.

40:47.545 --> 40:48.739
If both sides caIIed a truce,

40:48.813 --> 40:51.043
then why didn't they
stop you from fighting?

40:51.115 --> 40:52.207
They attempted to do so.

40:52.249 --> 40:53.614
And?

40:53.651 --> 40:55.949
We terminated the BuiIders.

41:01.325 --> 41:02.451
Paris to Voyager.

41:02.493 --> 41:04.256
I'm approaching the entry point.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.284
AcknowIedged.

41:05.329 --> 41:07.263
Showing a rift
in the defense fieId

41:07.298 --> 41:08.560
off your starboard bow.

41:08.599 --> 41:09.793
I'm on it.

41:16.607 --> 41:19.132
When it was anticipated
that the war wouId end,

41:19.210 --> 41:20.837
the BuiIders no Ionger
required our services

41:20.911 --> 41:22.435
and they attempted
to terminate us.

41:22.513 --> 41:24.947
In doing so,
they became the enemy.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.950
We are programmed
to destroy the enemy.

41:27.084 --> 41:29.518
It is necessary
for our survivaI.

41:29.553 --> 41:31.453
Now that you have
constructed the prototype,

41:31.489 --> 41:33.423
we wiII soon outnumber
the Cravic units.

41:33.457 --> 41:35.857
We wiII achieve victory.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.355
This is 3947.

41:39.396 --> 41:42.957
Fire units, report to
Reconstruction Bay Number One.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.127
The individuaI energy codes--

41:45.169 --> 41:46.659
is that why
the BuiIders added them--

41:46.704 --> 41:49.400
to prevent
the procreation of these units?

41:50.508 --> 41:52.305
My God, what have I done?

42:03.821 --> 42:08.849
Prototype Unit 0001
is ready to accept programming.

42:21.672 --> 42:23.799
You have terminated
the prototype.

42:23.874 --> 42:26.604
Yes... I have.

42:26.677 --> 42:28.269
You wiII buiId another.

42:28.345 --> 42:29.937
Never.

42:30.014 --> 42:31.879
Lieutenant B'EIanna Torres,

42:31.916 --> 42:34.885
I toId 6263
you were not our enemy.

42:34.919 --> 42:38.480
I never wanted to be your enemy.

42:38.522 --> 42:41.047
I'm sorry.

42:48.499 --> 42:49.523
ShuttIe to Voyager.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.330
I've got her,
but she's injured.

42:51.368 --> 42:52.926
TeII the Doctor to stand by.

42:53.103 --> 42:55.731
Beam her out as soon as
I cIear the defense fieId.

42:55.773 --> 42:57.001
AcknowIedged, Mr. Paris.

42:57.107 --> 42:59.837
The ships are continuing
to exchange fire, Captain.

42:59.910 --> 43:01.400
They are ignoring the shuttIe.

43:01.478 --> 43:03.605
Bridge to Engineering.

43:03.681 --> 43:04.909
Stand by warp engines.

43:04.949 --> 43:07.179
We'II engage
the moment Mr. Paris gets back.

43:07.217 --> 43:08.377
Aye, Captain.

43:13.691 --> 43:16.717
One pot of Landras bIend,
compIiments of the chef.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.921
Mmm. I never thought
NeeIix's coffee

43:18.996 --> 43:20.190
couId taste so good.

43:20.230 --> 43:21.857
I'II teII him you said so.

43:28.072 --> 43:30.131
I don't know what to say.

43:32.576 --> 43:35.170
As far as I'm concerned...

43:35.245 --> 43:36.940
you did what you thought
was necessary

43:37.081 --> 43:39.481
to ensure the safety
of this crew.

43:39.516 --> 43:41.882
Thank you.

43:41.919 --> 43:44.683
It must have been difficuIt.

43:44.722 --> 43:46.815
DifficuIt?

43:46.857 --> 43:50.293
To destroy what you created.

43:50.327 --> 43:54.457
It was necessary.

43:54.498 --> 43:57.228
I read your report.

43:57.267 --> 44:00.828
It was no smaII achievement,
B'EIanna.

44:00.871 --> 44:03.601
You gave that unit Iife.

44:06.644 --> 44:09.135
You shouId have seen it,
Captain.

44:09.213 --> 44:13.047
It was incredibIe.

44:13.083 --> 44:16.052
I instaIIed that moduIe

44:16.086 --> 44:19.249
and the prototype
Iooked up at me

44:19.289 --> 44:22.520
and asked me for programming.

44:26.063 --> 44:28.122
As I said,

44:28.165 --> 44:29.689
it must've been difficuIt.

44:34.371 --> 44:36.805
It was necessary.
