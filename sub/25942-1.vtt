00:51.185 --> 00:54.053
Uh, sorry. Sorry! Sorry.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.759
You, uh, you Mike?

01:00.761 --> 01:02.795
Yeah, Michael!
You must be Donald.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.363
Don. It's never-- [laughs]

01:04.364 --> 01:05.631
-It's never Donald.
-Yeah?

01:05.633 --> 01:07.499
Uh, I hope I'm not late.

01:07.501 --> 01:11.570
No, no way, but let's not make
a habit out of it. Okay?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.172
Crazy day at work.
I got hung up--

01:13.174 --> 01:14.740
-Oh, none for me,
thanks. Ho!
-Huh?

01:14.742 --> 01:17.443
You-- You--
You don't want a beer?

01:17.445 --> 01:18.510
Sorry.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.778
Hey!

01:19.780 --> 01:21.213
Don't apologize, man.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.715
If it's a problem,
it's a disease.

01:23.717 --> 01:26.552
Half my friends--
out of the bar,
into the program.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.687
Back to their wives,
and who are we to judge?

01:28.689 --> 01:30.155
But can I tell you
something, Mike?

01:30.157 --> 01:32.191
Yeah.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.759
They're sure as hell
not as much fun.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.361
I just don't want a beer is all.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.197
That's what you said.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.732
I ju-- I don't want you to think
I have a problem is all.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.501
I'm not thinking anything.

01:42.503 --> 01:46.572
It is, however, interesting that
you keep bringing it back up.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.640
-I just wanna be clear.
-Got it.

01:48.642 --> 01:52.811
But if you do have a problem,

01:52.813 --> 01:55.380
it's not your fault.

01:55.382 --> 01:57.249
It's a disease.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.551
I mean, you wouldn't blame
somebody for having cancer,
would you?

01:59.553 --> 02:01.687
-No, not me.
-So, I think it's important
that we are

02:01.689 --> 02:04.623
understanding
and less judgmental.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.859
I'm pretty sure
we're on the same page.

02:06.861 --> 02:07.893
Excellent.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.161
-[chuckling]
-Let's started.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.663
-Okay.
-Oh! Incidentally,

02:11.665 --> 02:14.433
you and I are going to be
spending a lot of time together.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.869
And if I "unwind" with a beer,

02:16.871 --> 02:18.871
you don't need
to call an intervention.

02:18.873 --> 02:21.207
I don't have
that particular disease.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.542
-Just so we understand
each other.
-No, not an issue.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.444
You do whatever you want.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.579
Well, thanking you. It's...

02:27.581 --> 02:29.748
terrific to get permission
from the new guy.

02:29.750 --> 02:30.883
[laughing]

02:32.219 --> 02:33.252
Mmm.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.556
Have you ever done
a draft before, Mike?

02:38.692 --> 02:41.860
-Uh, you mean...
-Getting new kids on the team?

02:41.862 --> 02:44.296
My son, Jimmy, watches
all the other kids at school,

02:44.298 --> 02:46.865
and he clues me in
who the best prospects are.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.268
But all the kids
get on a team, right?

02:50.337 --> 02:51.603
Well, of course, Mike.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.306
This is all about the kids.

02:54.308 --> 02:57.342
But... the ones
you'd like to avoid

02:57.344 --> 03:00.245
are the ones who would
rather be in Brigadoon,

03:00.247 --> 03:01.713
if you know what I'm saying.
[laughing]

03:01.715 --> 03:03.949
I just-- As long as everybody
gets a chance.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.417
That's all I'm concerned with.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.555
Relax.

03:09.556 --> 03:12.591
Because your kid got one hell of
a scouting report from my kid.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.194
-Seriously?
-Come on.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.228
My...

03:16.230 --> 03:17.930
Oh, my God, I'm all misty.

03:17.932 --> 03:19.364
That's...

03:19.366 --> 03:21.633
That is big. That is...
You don't know how--

03:21.635 --> 03:22.801
Woo-hoo!

03:24.205 --> 03:26.271
[chuckles]
That kid...

03:29.343 --> 03:32.344
I tell you what there, Mike.
When we get to the draft...

03:33.514 --> 03:37.282
let me do the talking.
You just... observe.

03:37.284 --> 03:39.251
-Okay.
-How about that?

03:39.253 --> 03:40.619
Good.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.555
Hey, you guys, make a path.
Come on.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.624

[quiet chattering]

05:31.532 --> 05:32.831
Hi.

05:32.833 --> 05:33.899
Hey, Mike!

05:33.901 --> 05:36.034
-Yeah.
-You are unbelievable!

05:36.036 --> 05:38.570
You left the same time as me
and you're still late.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.772
-Sorry, Don.
-Okay. Hey, uh, everybody!

05:40.774 --> 05:43.475
Uh, this is my new
assistant coach, Mikey Johnson!

05:43.477 --> 05:45.777
-Or Michael.
-[All] Hey, Mike, how you doing?

05:45.779 --> 05:48.613
Yeah. Mike's new in town,
so if you can cut him
a little slack, that'd be great.

05:48.615 --> 05:49.981
[chuckling] Okay, yeah.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.117
Everyone knows
how this works, right?

05:52.119 --> 05:55.687
We pick the new kids
in reverse order in how
we finished last year, okay?

05:55.689 --> 05:59.758
So, I guess that means
I pick last.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.126
Yeah. It does.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.995
I gotta stop winning
that championship

06:03.997 --> 06:06.698
if I ever wanna get
a decent pick, don't I?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.700
-Say, Pete, I...
-[sighs] Yeah, Don.

06:08.702 --> 06:12.437
If memory serves,
I think your two and...

06:12.439 --> 06:16.041
13 record entitles
you to go first.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.943
So, you're a winner!

06:17.945 --> 06:19.978
-You're the winner, Pete!
How about it?
-[laughter]

Uh, the Cardinals pick
Ralph Johnson.

Oh, that's a good pick.
That's a good pick.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.524
-Yeah.
-Unfortunately, we, um...

06:33.594 --> 06:36.128
Yeah, we already have
Ralph Johnson.

06:36.130 --> 06:37.596
[laughs]

06:38.532 --> 06:39.931
How do you figure that, Don?

06:39.933 --> 06:43.402
Mmm, his Dad here's coaching
the Pirates with me, so...

06:43.404 --> 06:44.703
he's ours!

06:44.705 --> 06:46.789
Actually, Don--

06:46.790 --> 06:48.874
Psst. Remember our agreement.
No talking. Just watch.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.442
But he's on our available list.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.877
[Don]
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.612
I don't make up the rules.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.914
I just use them
to our advantage.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.483
Kids are automatically put on
the team their dad coaches.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.152
Why do you think
I'm with... [speaks gibberish]

07:00.154 --> 07:02.954
Don, I know
I'm not supposed to talk,
but Ralph Johnson is not my son.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.823
Yes, he is, you're a Johnson.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.658
-No, he's another Johnson.
-Oh, give me a break.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.727
-He's the only Goddamn Johnson
in the draft.
-He's not my son!

07:08.729 --> 07:10.095
Well, who is your son?

07:10.097 --> 07:11.797
Frank. Frank Nassiter-Wise.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.066
Nassiter-Wise?

07:15.068 --> 07:17.669
You mean-- You mean the little
hyphenate, with the glasses?

07:17.671 --> 07:19.771
Right. He's nearsighted.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.509
Why are you Johnson
and he's Nassiter-Wise?

07:24.511 --> 07:26.745
Oh. My wife's first marriage.

07:27.681 --> 07:28.780
Ho!

07:30.584 --> 07:32.017
Is there a problem, Don?

07:32.953 --> 07:35.887
Yeah! Uh-huh!

07:35.889 --> 07:39.658
Could someone help me
get the Goddamn egg
off of my face, Pete?

07:39.660 --> 07:40.892
[all laughing]

07:40.894 --> 07:45.030
Oh, ho-ho-ho!
Okay.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.666
-[Pete] Yeah!
-Please enjoy, fellas.

07:47.668 --> 07:48.967
This is very young.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.636
While Don gets the egg
off his face, guys,

07:51.638 --> 07:52.904
let's continue with the draft.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.973
Bob, you're next.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.008
The Royals pick Timmy Schmidt.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.477
¶ ¶

07:58.479 --> 08:00.479
Tell me something, Mike.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.480
Are you sure
that you want to coach?

08:02.483 --> 08:03.882
I'm sure. I'm glad to help.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.517
No, no. Full, full disclosure.

08:05.519 --> 08:08.620
I make a lot of demands
on my assistant coach.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.055
So, if this isn't going to be

08:10.057 --> 08:13.124
as serious a commitment
as your marriage or your job,

08:13.126 --> 08:15.660
then, then I suggest
you bow out.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.662
Thanks, but I wanna
make a contribution.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.164
[laughs] All, All I'm saying is,

08:19.166 --> 08:21.933
take the night. Think about it.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.169
I've already thought about it,
Don, and that's why I'm here.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.104
Don't say anything. Kick it
around in your mental mind.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.573
Go back and forth.
Throw it up in the air,
see where it lands.

08:28.575 --> 08:31.576
Would you... Would you at least
promise me that, Mike?

08:31.578 --> 08:32.910
-Sorry, Don.
-Would you, would you,

08:32.913 --> 08:35.881
would you at least
rethink it for me?

08:35.883 --> 08:38.917
I could tell you
I'm gonna rethink it,
but I'd be lying.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.822
Okay.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.023
First practice is
Saturday, 10:00 AM.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.059
Saturday, I think
it's supposed to rain.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.295
We'll be...

08:50.297 --> 08:51.730
right back here
at the gymnasium.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.166
You can tell a lot about a kid

08:54.167 --> 08:56.601
the way he handles ground balls
rocketing up off the gym floor,

08:56.603 --> 08:57.636
into his face.

08:58.772 --> 08:59.905
Mike...

09:00.841 --> 09:02.007
Please be on time.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.943
Yes.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.606
Welcome.

I'd like to take
the opportunity right now
to invite you to leave.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.179
This is our time.
Please be back in one hour.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.958
Uh, Coach?

10:28.328 --> 10:30.061
Hi, I'm Timmy's mother.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.163
Um, I'd like to stick around,
if that's okay.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.699
Timmy has some
separation issues.

10:34.701 --> 10:37.102
Oh my goodness.
By-- By all means,

10:37.104 --> 10:39.104
stay as long as you like.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.940
Thanks!
You won't even know I'm here.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.274
Just please understand

that practice definitely
won't start until you leave.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.330
Congratulations.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.099
You are the luckiest
kids in town.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.135
You're on my team.

we are gonna work hard,

we're gonna learn a lot,
and we're gonna have fun.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.811
How do you have fun
playing baseball?

11:19.813 --> 11:20.879
It's one word.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.882
Winning.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.685
Winning is fun.

11:26.687 --> 11:30.722
Losing stinks.
I hope that's not
new information to any of you.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.091
And I have just one rule.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.062
I'm in charge.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.370
[whistle trills]

11:47.474 --> 11:49.741
...you run to me.

11:49.743 --> 11:52.077
If you dawdle, no problem.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.913
Ya just won't play
the next game.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.115
I want you to report
to the ball field

11:57.117 --> 12:00.418
one half-hour early on game day.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.421
And if you ask if you can
play a particular position--

12:03.423 --> 12:07.325
"Coach, could I please play
shortstop?" I guarantee you,

12:07.327 --> 12:11.029
you will not play shortstop
for five games.

12:12.299 --> 12:15.200
Now, I am pleased

12:15.202 --> 12:18.203
that most of you are wearing
the equipment that we suggested.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.171
Uh...

12:22.275 --> 12:23.441
Phillip.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.076
Phillip Bailey?

12:27.514 --> 12:30.048
Good job remembering the cup.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.717
FYI, son,

12:32.718 --> 12:35.385
the cup is usually worn
on the inside of your pants.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.922
No, no! No, no, no, no, no, no!
That's, that's not appropriate!

12:37.924 --> 12:39.758
You can do that later.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.860
Attaboy.

12:41.862 --> 12:45.363
Now, we all drop fly balls,
and we miss grounders,

12:45.365 --> 12:47.832
and we make bad throws.
That's baseball.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.200
Those are called
"physical errors."

12:49.202 --> 12:51.770
But can anyone
tell me what it is

12:51.772 --> 12:53.505
when we forget
how many outs there are,

12:53.507 --> 12:55.840
or we throw to the wrong base?

12:55.842 --> 12:56.908
Anybody?

12:56.910 --> 12:58.076
Stupid!

12:58.078 --> 12:59.344
Screw-ups!

12:59.346 --> 13:01.479
No and no.

13:02.949 --> 13:06.417
Those are called,
"mental errors." And yes,

13:06.419 --> 13:09.053
you're gonna hear from me
when you commit mental errors.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.121
[Michael]
Hey, Coach Don!

13:10.123 --> 13:11.389
Hey, team!

13:11.391 --> 13:13.424
Hey, you're looking sharp.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.327
Oh, look who it is.
Our new assistant coach.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.096
We'd about given up
on you there, Mike.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.298
-I guess I'm a few minutes late.
-Eleven, but who's counting?

13:20.300 --> 13:23.001
-This is Frankie.
-Ah, Frank, why don't you,

13:23.003 --> 13:25.270
go ahead, and get yourself
a seat up in the bleachers?

13:25.272 --> 13:26.571
[Michael]
Yeah, go ahead.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.373
Attaboy.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.440
Aah!

13:29.442 --> 13:30.575
[Don]
You okay, bud?

13:30.577 --> 13:32.577
Yeah, he--
We couldn't find his glasses.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.580
Hey, Coach Don, I got you
a mocha latte, extra foam.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.115
I'm not sure how you take it.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.818
Oh, gosh, that is much
appreciated. Cheers.

13:39.820 --> 13:43.054
-Hey.
-But seeing as we have
so very much work to do here,

13:43.056 --> 13:44.956
I'm just gonna keep that...

13:44.958 --> 13:48.026
right over there.
Save it for later.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.195
Was it that you didn't like
the mocha, or was it the latte?

13:50.197 --> 13:54.599
Cards on the table, I just like
plain, old-fashioned,
American coffee.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.000
-Okay.
-Now,

13:56.002 --> 13:58.169
can anyone from last year's
squad tell me,

13:58.171 --> 14:01.105
how many times was
former Assistant Coach Tony...

14:01.107 --> 14:02.307
[chuckles]

14:02.309 --> 14:04.309
...late for practice?

14:04.311 --> 14:06.945
Once. That's correct,
Timor. You see,

14:06.947 --> 14:09.414
Tony is a police officer.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.916
And, one time, when he was
stopping a burglary,

14:11.918 --> 14:13.518
he got himself shot
in the groin area.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.920
It was a sickening, bloody mess.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.425
Tony was exactly 10 minutes late
for practice that day.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.927
I tell you this because

14:22.929 --> 14:25.496
if you have an excuse,

14:25.498 --> 14:26.564
pop,

14:26.566 --> 14:29.100
you won't hear a peep out of me.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.502
What is your excuse,
Assistant Coach Mike?

14:33.340 --> 14:34.973
The traffic was unbelievable.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.209
Fair enough.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.578
Cannot be helped. Unless,

14:40.580 --> 14:43.314
-you allow enough time
to get here.
-[phone ringing]

14:43.316 --> 14:45.316
Oh, boy. I gotta take this.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.286
Hey. Hey, Roger.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.354
Yeah.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.560
Assistant Coach Mike is...

14:55.562 --> 14:57.996
helping us, by demonstrating

14:57.998 --> 15:00.932
things that you should never do.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.601
Like, be late or take calls.
And I know, I know,

15:03.603 --> 15:06.237
a lot of you have
your own cell phones.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.106
God knows what your parents
are thinking.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.341
The fact of the matter
is that most people
shouldn't even have kids.

15:10.343 --> 15:13.444
They can't say no, they don't
take it seriously, and,

15:13.445 --> 15:16.546
"Oh gee! Why is everybody
on dope and pregnant,
living off my tax dollars?"

15:16.549 --> 15:18.416
My one rule is,

15:18.418 --> 15:21.252
if I catch you chatting
on the cell phone...

15:22.455 --> 15:25.590
Ah! Is, uh,
everything copacetic?

15:25.592 --> 15:27.258
Yeah. I just had
to put out a fire.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.560
Wasn't a real fire.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.063
-It won't happen again,
Coach Don.
-Ha!

15:32.065 --> 15:36.267
So, uh, I guess I should say
a few words about myself. Uh...

15:36.269 --> 15:39.404
-My name is Michael Johnson.
-You can call him Mike, team.

15:39.406 --> 15:42.106
Well, I prefer Michael,
but whatever.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.942
Um, when I was your age,

15:43.944 --> 15:46.477
I competed in a great many
curling matches.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.446
Was that curling,
Assistant Coach Mike?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.581
I spent part of my childhood
in Canada.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.383
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.419
Which is where
curling is popular.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.421
Now, as a 10-year-old boy,

15:56.423 --> 15:59.057
nothing was more important
to me than curling.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.059
But, honestly, now,
I can tell you,

16:01.061 --> 16:03.094
I don't remember
who won and who lost.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.063
So, listen. Now,
this is very important.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.665
This is about the playing.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.467
Not about the winning
or the losing.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.969
But, having fun,
and I guarantee you,

16:10.971 --> 16:12.403
we're gonna have a heck
of a good time here.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.438
Say, Mike...

16:13.440 --> 16:15.490
We, uh,

16:15.491 --> 16:17.541
we covered fun right before
you got here. Must have been

16:17.544 --> 16:20.178
when you were stuck in that
unbelievable traffic.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.747
So, kids, remember,
this is all about you.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.416
So, for example,
if you have a particular
position you wanna play,

16:25.418 --> 16:26.584
be sure to let us know.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.387
Thank you, Mike!
That's a terrific intro.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.689
Fellas, dive into that bag.
Let's warm those arms up.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.458
We're gonna have a terrific
practice. Here we go!

16:33.460 --> 16:35.193
¶ ¶

16:38.231 --> 16:39.564
All right, lemme see you turn.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.532
I wanna see that
front foot step. Nice!

16:41.534 --> 16:43.701
Jude, you're a new kid,
but I like your style.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.170
Casey, nice.
You got the good arm.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.472
Oh, and my champions.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.574
How does it feel to be
a returning champion?

16:49.576 --> 16:51.109
[Kids]
It feels good!

16:51.111 --> 16:53.111
Oh! You just made my whole day.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.079
You're a leader, kid.
I like your style.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.682
I'm sorry I was late, Coach Don.
I-- I had to work.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.551
You keep putting your job
in front of the team, Mike.
I mean it.

17:00.553 --> 17:01.753
Been a rough week.

17:01.755 --> 17:03.388
My company has these
government contracts--

17:03.390 --> 17:04.789
Ooh!

17:04.790 --> 17:08.126
My company, well... [chuckling]

17:08.127 --> 17:10.294
Woo! Come on, ladies!

17:12.265 --> 17:14.232
Oh no, no, no, no, girls.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.200
Girls, you gotta wait
outside till 11:00.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.536
[scoffs] I don't think so.
We have the gym at 10:30.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.771
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.339
We have the gym
from 10:00 until 11:00.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.276
-Where's your permit?
-It's in my car.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.079
I'm calling my dad.
He's the assistant principal.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.384
All right.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.086
Give us 10 minutes,
and we'll be out of here.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.756
[whistle trills]

17:40.160 --> 17:41.225
Line up!

17:41.227 --> 17:42.560
[Don]
Here we go, Nate.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.761
Ready? Get down on it.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.696
¶ ¶

17:45.698 --> 17:48.332
That's a short one.
And, stick with it!

17:48.334 --> 17:49.400
Attaboy!

17:53.506 --> 17:54.772
Right, Timor,
what do you say, kid?

17:56.109 --> 17:59.744
¶ We can't take a break
from being ¶

17:59.746 --> 18:01.712
Here we go.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.082
Aah! Get down on it.
Let's go! Hustle.

18:04.818 --> 18:06.517
Tito, returning champion.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.289
¶ We waste away ¶

18:11.291 --> 18:13.357
¶ Oh, make a change ¶

18:13.359 --> 18:15.493
[Don] And strongest arm.
Holy moly!

18:15.495 --> 18:17.228
Hey, Jude, get down on it.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.633
¶ I am degraded ¶

18:22.635 --> 18:24.335
Get there, get there, get there.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.736
Nicely done, Jude!

18:25.738 --> 18:27.238
I'm proud of you. Who's up?

18:27.240 --> 18:29.207
Come on out, son. Ready?

18:29.209 --> 18:32.810
¶ We're too late ¶

18:32.812 --> 18:34.545
¶ Sold our best behavior ¶

18:34.547 --> 18:35.713
What do you say, Timmy?

18:39.419 --> 18:41.319
Here we go. Make a play on that.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.487
Okay, stick with it.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.822
Great play! Next batter.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.390
Jimmy! My guy.

18:46.392 --> 18:47.892
Jimmy, show it to me.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.228
That's what I'm talking about.
Great glove, kid.

18:50.230 --> 18:55.233
¶ Yeah, I won't have time ¶

18:55.235 --> 18:58.302
-[girls chanting]
-Nice. Who else we got?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.138
¶ ¶

19:05.445 --> 19:07.345
Make it happen, kid.
Short hop-- Oh!

19:09.716 --> 19:11.716
¶ I'll never notice ¶

19:11.718 --> 19:12.917
Good play.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.819
Rusty! Returning champion Rusty.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.687
Show me.
Let me see what you got, son.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.396
Watch out!

19:25.398 --> 19:26.697
Oh my gosh.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.301
Kahil. Right in the middle.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.536
In the face, you okay?

19:31.538 --> 19:33.171
All right, one last one.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.939
There you go. That's what
I'm talking about. Good feet.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.279
Nice, Kahil, nice!

19:41.281 --> 19:43.381
Everybody get a shot?
Who have we left out?

19:43.383 --> 19:44.549
Frankie, what do you say, pal?

19:44.551 --> 19:46.317
It's all about you, Frankie.

19:47.253 --> 19:50.788
¶ Away! ¶

19:50.790 --> 19:53.524
¶ Away ¶

19:53.526 --> 19:55.226
Get down on it.
Oh, come on, son!

19:55.228 --> 19:56.360
Give me some hustle.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.696
¶ I won't have time ¶

20:01.601 --> 20:03.301
[whistle trills]

20:04.704 --> 20:07.205
[girls chanting]

20:07.207 --> 20:08.506
Well, lemme tell you
something, fellas.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.608
That was
an outstanding practice.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.476
There was effort all around.
I'm proud of all of you.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.781
Everybody go home,
except for you and you.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.516
No! Not Nathan.

20:18.518 --> 20:19.717
You. All right!

20:19.719 --> 20:20.818
Go on, get outta here.

20:24.390 --> 20:27.491
Hey, Mike, go ahead
and pack that equipment up
for me, will you?

20:27.493 --> 20:28.559
Yeah.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.263
You sure it all fits?

20:32.265 --> 20:36.467
Well, lemme see,
it did last year
and the year before.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.402
Hell, maybe this year'll
be different.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.806
See, Mike, I-- I--
I have just one rule.

20:41.808 --> 20:45.443
You must clear things
through me, before you
go shouting 'em

20:45.445 --> 20:47.478
-to my team.
-What do you mean?

20:47.480 --> 20:50.314
I mean, you cannot stand up
there as my assistant coach

20:50.316 --> 20:52.516
and tell these kids
that winning doesn't matter,

20:52.518 --> 20:54.919
because that is just bullshit.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.020
Well...

20:57.490 --> 20:58.756
Look at the big picture, Don.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.259
[chuckles]

21:01.260 --> 21:03.761
Do you really remember
every game you won
and lost as a kid?

21:06.733 --> 21:09.934
When I was 12,
I batted 456 with 18 RBIs.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.503
We went 11 and 4
and lost the championship game,

21:12.505 --> 21:16.274
when Billy Nathan got
picked off third with two outs
in the last inning.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.476
I still think about that, Mike.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.810
I...

21:19.812 --> 21:21.779
I think about it a lot.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.014
See,

21:23.016 --> 21:24.982
I was coming up to bat,

21:24.984 --> 21:28.719
and if Billy hadn't
wandered off third in some kind
of damn dream state,

21:28.721 --> 21:32.923
I know, for a fact,
I would have driven him home,

21:32.925 --> 21:35.559
and we'd have gone on to win.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.461
I, I have...

21:37.463 --> 21:40.831
replayed that scenario
inside of my head

21:40.833 --> 21:42.600
many times, but...

21:44.070 --> 21:46.604
I never got the chance,

21:47.774 --> 21:50.908
because Billy took the bat
out of my hands.

21:53.513 --> 21:57.581
When Billy Nathan ran for
school board last year, I...

21:57.583 --> 22:00.551
could not find it in my heart
to vote for him.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.520
Even though I have
every reason to believe

22:02.522 --> 22:04.789
that he is
a good and honest man,

22:04.791 --> 22:07.458
who made a thoughtless mistake
when he was 11 years old.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.026
So, yes. I do...

22:12.065 --> 22:13.664
remember.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.771
Well, you have
a very good memory.

22:22.775 --> 22:25.409
There are a lot of men
who remember

22:26.512 --> 22:27.978
these things,

22:27.980 --> 22:29.113
Mike.

22:32.652 --> 22:35.619
Of course, it might be different
in the world of curling, I...

22:35.621 --> 22:37.355
¶ ¶

22:38.524 --> 22:41.425
Oh. You always wanna pack
the shin guards first.

22:41.427 --> 22:43.594
Otherwise, it doesn't fit.
[sniffs]

22:52.138 --> 22:54.071
[indistinct yelling]

22:54.072 --> 22:56.005
[grunts] Hey, you want me
to put these in your car?

22:56.008 --> 22:58.576
-No, no, no.
Why don't you go ahead
and hang onto that?

22:58.578 --> 23:01.379
That's the arrangement
I had with old Tony last year,
and it...

23:02.115 --> 23:04.615
God, it worked out like a charm.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.784
Hey, you guys,
stop messing around
or you're dead meat.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.123
Is practice over?

23:12.125 --> 23:14.625
Yeah, you're all done.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.560
Uh, is this special treatment
or punishment?

23:16.562 --> 23:17.728
What does it look like to you?

23:17.730 --> 23:19.063
Hey!

23:19.065 --> 23:20.798
You do that one more time,

23:20.800 --> 23:24.568
and you're taking a lap around
the entire school, ya jerkwads.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.604
Well, I think these kids
just wanna have a little fun.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.639
Why don't we send them home,
so they can play?

23:35.681 --> 23:37.815
Did you happen to notice
Eric's eye twitch?

23:41.888 --> 23:43.654
His parents just went through
a nasty split

23:43.656 --> 23:45.089
and neither one of 'em
will leave the house.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.792
His dad's-- [chuckles]
Oh...

23:48.761 --> 23:50.027
His dad comes to our games

23:50.029 --> 23:52.563
and yells about how
disappointed he is.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.633
So, when Eric's eye twitch
gets bad,

23:56.836 --> 23:58.502
I make him stay after practice.

23:58.504 --> 24:00.604
Then we go out for pizza.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.440
Then he has a sleepover
at our house.

24:04.444 --> 24:05.943
Well, that's
a real nice thing, Don.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.011
No...

24:08.548 --> 24:10.080
That's my job.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.783
I'd like to drag
his idiot parents

24:12.785 --> 24:14.652
out of the house
and beat their ass.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.687
I mean, gimme a break.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.656
In every marriage,
you're hanging on by a thread,

24:18.658 --> 24:20.591
and half the time, you regret
the day you were born,

24:20.593 --> 24:22.493
but that's no reason to quit.

24:22.495 --> 24:23.561
Huh?

24:24.630 --> 24:26.597
Hey, Jimmy!

24:26.599 --> 24:28.833
One more curveball,
and I guarantee you, son,

24:28.835 --> 24:31.135
you will find yourself
in the spring musical.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.904
And nobody wants to be that guy,
Jimmy. Nobody.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.674
Use your head for something
other than a hat rack,
will you please?

24:38.778 --> 24:40.778
-[glass shatters]
-[car alarm blaring]

24:40.780 --> 24:43.747
Uh, fellas. Let's, uh,
let's get outta here.
What do you say?

24:43.749 --> 24:45.783
Let's, uh, hippity-hop.
Here we go.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.053
Right, see you.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.222
[phone rings]

24:53.860 --> 24:55.092
Roger, hi.

24:56.028 --> 24:58.496
No, no. Mmm.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.832
You need it first thing
Monday morning?

25:01.834 --> 25:03.601
Just 'cause that's gonna take
most of my weekend,

25:03.603 --> 25:05.703
and I was really hoping I could
just play a little ball with--

25:06.639 --> 25:07.872
Right.

25:07.874 --> 25:10.274
Okay, first thing Monday.
You bet.

25:11.711 --> 25:12.843
[sighs]

25:14.213 --> 25:15.279
¶ ¶

25:19.752 --> 25:22.052
[Announcer]
It's opening day
at Champions Field,

25:22.054 --> 25:26.190
and, folks, it just doesn't get
any better than this.

25:26.192 --> 25:29.059
Last year's pennant-winning
Pirates kick off the season

25:29.061 --> 25:30.995
against the much improved
Cardinals.

25:30.997 --> 25:33.264
It should be a good one.

25:33.266 --> 25:36.267
And here's a big shout-out
to our sponsors.

25:46.078 --> 25:48.212
Be sure to make a visit
to the snack bar,

25:48.214 --> 25:52.283
and you'll find some brand-new
food choices that are easy
on the wallet.

25:52.285 --> 25:53.884
Like the Monster Dog.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.953
Eat four,
and the fifth one's free.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.026
Get over here!

26:02.028 --> 26:03.127
Now!

26:10.269 --> 26:11.335
Hi!

26:12.605 --> 26:13.938
Take the field.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.839
Ah, here he is.

26:15.841 --> 26:17.141
Man with the bag.
Right on the button,

26:17.143 --> 26:18.943
if we were starting late.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.578
No, no, I...

26:20.580 --> 26:21.912
Look, I'm 10 minutes early!

26:21.914 --> 26:23.914
You said the game
starts at noon.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.250
You must not have gotten
my one rule:

26:26.252 --> 26:28.852
30 minutes before game time.

26:28.854 --> 26:33.023
Tell you what there, Mike.
Why don't you, uh, go ahead,
and give them some fungoes?

26:33.025 --> 26:34.291
Fungoes?

26:34.293 --> 26:35.826
[chuckles]

26:35.828 --> 26:38.862
If old Tony was gonna be here,
he was the...

26:38.864 --> 26:40.364
he was the master of fungoes.

26:40.366 --> 26:41.765
Uh, if you'd show me
where they are,

26:41.767 --> 26:43.167
I'm happy to pass them out.

26:44.637 --> 26:45.903
Fungo's a fly ball, Mike.

26:45.905 --> 26:48.072
-You think you
could hit a few?
-Yeah.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.741
Fungoes.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.142
I'm on it!

26:52.144 --> 26:53.277
It's fungo time!

26:54.213 --> 26:56.647
Uh, Assistant Coach Mike?

26:56.649 --> 26:59.717
You're probably going to need a,
uh, a ball. Just...

26:59.719 --> 27:02.152
-for the full fungo experience.
-Yeah.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.957
Holy God Almighty.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.861
Okay, who wants a fungo?

27:13.966 --> 27:15.299
All right.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.400
Bases, hold.

27:17.670 --> 27:18.736
Fungoes!

27:21.307 --> 27:22.673
This is the one.

27:28.381 --> 27:29.880
[laughter]

27:29.882 --> 27:31.682
I got it.

27:31.684 --> 27:32.750
This is fun.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.352
[clapping]

27:37.690 --> 27:38.756
Coming left!

27:41.027 --> 27:42.092
Oh!

27:43.663 --> 27:44.962
[glass shatters]

27:50.836 --> 27:52.803
Oh, God.

27:53.739 --> 27:55.706
Uh... All right.

27:56.442 --> 27:57.708
[muffled groan]

28:01.247 --> 28:04.014
[whistle trills]

28:04.016 --> 28:05.115
Anybody know who...

28:08.387 --> 28:09.453
Take a knee.

28:09.455 --> 28:10.988
All right, you guys.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.091
Who's nervous?

28:17.930 --> 28:18.996
Yeah.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.799
Good.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.100
That's real good.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.902
You know what that means?

28:24.904 --> 28:26.837
Just means you wanna do well.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.739
Now, it's opening day.

28:28.741 --> 28:33.010
Let's get this season off
to a great start.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.378
I need to find out
whose car that was.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.447
That wasn't a car, Mike.

28:36.449 --> 28:38.449
It was, uh, it was my van.

28:38.451 --> 28:40.017
That was your van?

28:40.019 --> 28:41.251
I'm sorry. I'll pay.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.120
-Ah, forget it.
-Please, I, I,

28:43.122 --> 28:45.222
I don't want you resenting me
because I broke your headlight.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.191
If I resent you,

28:47.193 --> 28:50.461
it won't have anything to do
with my headlights.

28:50.463 --> 28:53.397
-I'd really feel better if you,
if you let me pay.
-All right, fellas.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.265
Here we go. Tito, one knee.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.334
What are you doing,
sitting down?

28:57.336 --> 28:59.336
Tito, you're playing
short because

28:59.338 --> 29:01.004
Kahil asked if he could.

29:01.006 --> 29:02.806
Kahil, you're playing center.

29:02.808 --> 29:04.975
I know you'd both rather
have it the other way around,

29:04.977 --> 29:07.277
but that's my one rule.
All right, fellas.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.147
Let's go!

29:10.149 --> 29:12.783
-Have fun!
-Which means win!

29:13.519 --> 29:16.220
Okay, fans. Let's play ball!

29:16.222 --> 29:18.255
The first batter
for the Cardinals is

29:18.257 --> 29:20.824
Theodore "Teddy" Mitch Delaney.

29:21.894 --> 29:23.794
All right, Jimmy.
Little heat on the hill.

29:23.796 --> 29:25.295
Thread that needle, son.
Thread that needle.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.165
Play to the best
of your abilities!

29:28.167 --> 29:29.967
Nobody can ask
for more than that.

29:31.036 --> 29:33.036
We're all winners
if we do our best!

29:34.373 --> 29:35.806
Mike, don't say it like that.

29:36.542 --> 29:37.841
Strike!

29:37.843 --> 29:39.109
-How...
-[crowd cheering]

29:39.111 --> 29:40.210
How do you want me to say it?

29:41.947 --> 29:43.213
Play within yourself.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.250
Play within yourself?

29:46.252 --> 29:47.384
[chuckling] Sounds dirty.

29:49.088 --> 29:50.521
It just means play your game.

29:50.523 --> 29:53.090
Don't try to go
beyond your ability.

29:54.794 --> 29:55.859
Ball high.

29:55.861 --> 29:56.960
But don't we want them

29:56.962 --> 29:59.263
to exceed what they've
already done?

29:59.265 --> 30:02.966
I see our job as creating
a safe, nurturing atmosphere,

30:02.968 --> 30:05.202
where the kids aren't afraid
to strive for greatness

30:05.204 --> 30:06.537
because they're
afraid of failure.

30:06.539 --> 30:08.338
Mike, I don't want you
yelling that from my bench.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.340
Well, I'm not comfortable
yelling play within yourself.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.543
Well, you don't want them
playing within someone else,
do you?

30:13.879 --> 30:15.662
-Ball two.
-[cheering]

30:15.663 --> 30:17.446
All right, look alive out there,
fellas. Here we go.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.483
All right, Phillip,
if he hits it, you hurry.

30:20.920 --> 30:21.952
[Umpire]
Ball three.

30:21.954 --> 30:23.187
Small point, Mike.

30:24.223 --> 30:26.190
We, uh...

30:26.192 --> 30:28.125
don't say hurry in baseball.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.461
We say go.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.530
But, we want them to go fast,
which means hurry--

30:33.532 --> 30:35.165
Don't say hurry, Mike.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.167
These kids...

30:37.169 --> 30:39.536
They're at
an impressionable age.

30:39.538 --> 30:40.904
Okay?

30:40.906 --> 30:41.939
Okay.

30:45.211 --> 30:46.243
[Boy]
Let's go, Jimmy.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.612
Ball four! Take your base.

30:48.614 --> 30:49.913
[cheering]

30:54.253 --> 30:56.620
Throw strikes, Jimmy!
Here we go.

31:03.229 --> 31:04.294
Ball one.

31:04.296 --> 31:05.429
[cheering]

31:07.867 --> 31:08.966
All right, no sweat, son.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.367
We're just playing catch.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.401
Like in the backyard.

31:13.572 --> 31:14.605
[Umpire]
Strike!

31:14.607 --> 31:16.440
Ball two.

31:16.442 --> 31:17.641
Ball three.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.877
Ball four! Take your base.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.178
[cheering]

31:22.114 --> 31:23.447
[Don]
Zero pressure.

31:23.449 --> 31:24.915
Just playing catch.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.416
Groove a strike for me, son.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.588
[Kid]
Throw some strikes.
Let's go, Jimmy!

31:33.425 --> 31:34.491
Strike!

31:35.427 --> 31:37.461
[Umpire]
Ball one. Ball two.

31:38.931 --> 31:41.465
[Umpire]
Ball three. Strike two!

31:41.467 --> 31:43.667
-[Umpire] Take your base.
-[cheering]

31:43.669 --> 31:44.935
[indistinct chatter]

31:47.172 --> 31:48.605
Now batting for the Cardinals,

31:48.607 --> 31:50.974
Ralph "Boom Boom" Johnson.

31:50.976 --> 31:52.242
[cheering]

31:55.047 --> 31:57.481
All right, Jimmy, you got him.
Nothing to worry about.

32:05.357 --> 32:06.423
Ball!

32:07.993 --> 32:09.126
Can't walk him, Jimbo.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.560
Don't let him hit.

32:11.664 --> 32:13.096
Throw strikes, Jimmy!

32:20.039 --> 32:21.371
[crowd cheers]

32:23.375 --> 32:25.943
Oh. For the love of God.

32:35.721 --> 32:37.721
Mike, you're killing us
right now.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.156
What?

32:39.158 --> 32:40.557
[cheering continues]

32:45.030 --> 32:47.030
If that was your kid,
we'd be winning.

32:50.669 --> 32:52.035
[groans]

32:53.172 --> 32:54.237
No!

32:54.239 --> 32:56.540
¶ ¶

33:00.679 --> 33:02.346
Throw third!

33:05.184 --> 33:06.984
[cheering]

33:06.986 --> 33:08.018
[Umpire]
He's out.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.221
Strike.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.724
Strike!

33:13.726 --> 33:14.758
Strike three!

33:17.196 --> 33:19.696
Oh! Run it out, run it out!

33:19.698 --> 33:21.431
Woo!

33:22.735 --> 33:24.001
Oh!

33:24.003 --> 33:25.102
Here we go, Jude, down!

33:25.104 --> 33:26.203
Run it out!

33:26.205 --> 33:27.771
Down! Get down! Get down!

33:27.773 --> 33:29.306
[laughing]

33:29.308 --> 33:32.376
Attaboy! Blazing speed!

33:32.378 --> 33:33.477
Isn't this fun?

33:34.546 --> 33:36.680
-Go! Attaboy!
-Oh! Keep going!

33:36.682 --> 33:38.615
-Keep going!
-He scored! You scored!
You're down!

33:40.152 --> 33:42.552
You're down! What?
Oh, get back. Attaboy!

33:44.256 --> 33:46.490
Now, we're playing
major league baseball!

33:48.027 --> 33:50.027
And we're going!

33:50.029 --> 33:51.595
Hit it! Go home!
Yeah, good hustle, good hustle!

33:53.298 --> 33:55.265
You're going around!
Roundy round!

33:55.267 --> 33:57.434
[cheering]

33:57.436 --> 33:59.169
Woohoo! Woo!

33:59.171 --> 34:01.204
[laughing]

34:01.206 --> 34:02.889
Hey, you didn't do
anything wrong.

34:02.890 --> 34:04.573
That had nothing to do with you.
He just hit it good.

34:04.576 --> 34:07.377
You guys are playing great.
You guys are playing great, too.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.619
¶ ¶

34:25.797 --> 34:27.097
Strike!

34:27.099 --> 34:28.565
Can I point something out, Mike?

34:30.135 --> 34:32.135
What are we looking at?

34:32.137 --> 34:33.603
¶ ¶

34:38.110 --> 34:39.176
Mrs. Timmy.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.210
What about her?

34:42.447 --> 34:43.547
She wants me.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.514
She wants you?

34:46.717 --> 34:48.385
¶ ¶

34:53.425 --> 34:55.225
Did you see what she did
when I just looked at her?

34:56.161 --> 34:57.811
She's eating...

34:57.812 --> 34:59.462
Oh, come on, Mike.
What rock do you live under?

34:59.465 --> 35:01.398
For the love of God.

35:02.468 --> 35:03.733
Strike two!

35:03.735 --> 35:05.702
Don't you understand
there's a whole fun house

35:05.704 --> 35:09.172
out there of lonely, troubled,
desperate moms.

35:09.174 --> 35:11.341
It's a major coaching perk.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.376
They see a slick guy,
like me, and...

35:14.313 --> 35:17.564
even you parading around,

35:17.565 --> 35:20.816
and they cannot be held
responsible for their minds
running wild.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.520
Huh.

35:23.522 --> 35:24.554
Man.

35:25.524 --> 35:26.656
¶ ¶

35:28.594 --> 35:30.360
Oh, if I was single.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.764
Ball high!
Take your base.

35:34.766 --> 35:37.701
All right, last inning.
Let's hold 'em!

35:37.703 --> 35:40.370
Uh, it's only the sixth inning,
Coach.

35:40.372 --> 35:41.805
This is Ripken league, Mike.

35:41.807 --> 35:42.873
That's all we play.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.443
Everything I know is wrong.

35:46.445 --> 35:47.945
All right, Jimmy.

35:47.946 --> 35:49.446
-[clapping]
-Come on, kid, you the man.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.615
[Kids]
Yeah, come on, Jimmy!
You got it!

35:54.586 --> 35:57.387
-You were looking at your van,
weren't you?
-No.

35:57.389 --> 36:00.724
-You're getting your money,
whether you want it or not.
-Stop, Mike.

36:00.726 --> 36:03.393
I saw you looking at your van.
I know what you're thinking.

36:03.395 --> 36:04.728
You don't have a clue
what I'm thinking.

36:06.198 --> 36:07.264
You were looking at your van.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.465
I'm not looking at my van.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.350
You were looking at your van.

36:10.351 --> 36:12.234
-I was not looking at my van.
-Well, what were you looking at?

36:12.237 --> 36:13.537
I don't have to tell you.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.472
I know you don't have to tell me
because I know.

36:20.212 --> 36:22.312
[clapping]

36:22.314 --> 36:24.314
I was looking for my wife.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.649
-[Umpire] Ball one.
-Okay?

36:25.651 --> 36:27.184
I thought maybe she'd come...

36:28.687 --> 36:29.753
opening day.

36:30.822 --> 36:31.855
Oh.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.457
I guess I don't, I don't know.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.196
Strike!

36:39.198 --> 36:40.497
[cheering]

36:40.499 --> 36:42.532
She might be on her way.
Traffic can be rough.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.434
You're the only one,

36:44.436 --> 36:45.802
in this town,

36:45.804 --> 36:47.804
who ever gets in traffic.

36:47.806 --> 36:50.874
Honest to God,
I don't even know
how you find it.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.543
[whistles]
Here we go!

36:54.479 --> 36:55.545
[breathy whistle]

36:57.316 --> 36:58.381
[hissing]

36:58.383 --> 36:59.416
¶ ¶

37:01.553 --> 37:03.220
[cheering]

37:04.923 --> 37:05.989
-[Umpire] He's out.
-[Both] Oh!

37:05.991 --> 37:07.324
[laughing]

37:08.260 --> 37:09.292
[Michael]
How about that?

37:09.294 --> 37:11.428
[Don]
Tito, kid! Attaboy!

37:11.430 --> 37:13.363
You are not there by mistake!

37:13.365 --> 37:15.732
All right. Kahil,
you seeing this? Huh?

37:15.734 --> 37:19.436
Could have been you,
but it's not.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.972
There's no mistakes. I put
my people where they belong.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.610
Straight up, Eric! Your ball!

37:30.482 --> 37:31.648
[grunts]

37:31.650 --> 37:33.283
[cheering]

37:35.520 --> 37:37.420
That was a lucky catch, Eric.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.922
You gotta watch the ball!

37:43.695 --> 37:45.962
[muttering] This is the season
I kick that guy's ass.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.264
Honest to God.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.402
All right, you guys.

37:52.404 --> 37:53.837
Bases loaded, two away.

37:53.839 --> 37:56.339
One more out,
we get a play at any bag,

37:56.341 --> 37:58.575
we go home.

37:58.576 --> 38:00.810
[Announcer]
Coming to the plate is
Ralph "Boom Boom" Johnson.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.679
[cheering]

38:05.584 --> 38:08.818
Don, I'm sorry he's not my kid.

38:13.659 --> 38:14.924
Oh, it's not your fault, Mike.

38:15.861 --> 38:16.960
Shake it off.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.698
Shake it off.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.567
Jimmy, you gotta pitch to him.
Got to know where to put 'em.

38:24.569 --> 38:25.602
Come on, son!

38:31.476 --> 38:32.976
¶ ¶

38:39.451 --> 38:40.650
[Boy]
Strike him!

38:41.687 --> 38:42.819
[cheering]

38:42.821 --> 38:43.920
Oh, dear God, no.

38:47.459 --> 38:48.858
[Don]
Easy catch, Frankie.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.460
Easy catch, and we win, son.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.796
[Don]
Look at all the way
into your glove.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.632
Pick it up!
Hit the cutoff man!

38:57.502 --> 38:58.802
Frankie!

38:58.804 --> 39:00.837
[cheering]

39:02.574 --> 39:05.075
[Michael]
Throw it.
Throw the ball, Frankie!

39:05.077 --> 39:07.677
[stammering] Don't...
Don't hold the ball.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.112
-[Don] Throw it!
-It's like playing catch!

39:09.114 --> 39:10.647
Frankie, throw the ball!

39:10.649 --> 39:11.981
-Throw it!
-See the boy waiting?

39:11.983 --> 39:14.184
-See him?
-Get the cutoff man!

39:14.185 --> 39:16.386
-[Don] Throw the ball, Frankie!
-Frankie, hit the cutoff man!

39:16.388 --> 39:18.621
[Don]
Throw the ball!
Oh, throw the ball!

39:18.623 --> 39:20.090
[cheering]

39:21.026 --> 39:23.460
Oh! Oh!

39:23.462 --> 39:24.594
Oh!

39:24.596 --> 39:26.363
[Don]
Oh!

39:34.773 --> 39:36.840
Good job, boys. I know.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.708
I know.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.643
It's okay to cry.

39:40.645 --> 39:42.579
We'll get 'em next time.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.047
My one rule,

39:44.983 --> 39:46.082
is this...

39:48.687 --> 39:50.019
do not ever,

39:50.021 --> 39:51.788
ever,

39:51.790 --> 39:53.156
hold onto the ball,

39:53.158 --> 39:54.824
in my outfield.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.527
Frankie, I'm talking to you.
I'm over here.

39:57.529 --> 39:59.696
[Michael]
Look at Coach Don, Frankie,
when he's talking to you.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.998
[Don]
I don't ever want to see
anything like that

40:02.000 --> 40:05.402
ever again.
Because whatever that was,

40:05.404 --> 40:07.103
it wasn't baseball.

40:07.105 --> 40:09.105
[Michael]
Well, excuse me, Coach Don,
I thought we said

40:09.107 --> 40:11.040
we weren't gonna get on the kids
about physical errors.

40:11.042 --> 40:12.776
Well, no, that's true, Mike.

40:12.777 --> 40:14.511
But I think what we just
witnessed out in right field

40:14.513 --> 40:17.180
was a whole salad bar
of mental errors.

40:17.182 --> 40:19.182
Ah, he dropped the ball.
That's, uh,

40:19.184 --> 40:20.750
that's a physical error.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.653
Yes, but if he'd used two hands,
as I instructed him,

40:23.655 --> 40:24.854
he would have caught the ball.

40:24.856 --> 40:26.489
Hence, mental error.

40:26.491 --> 40:28.758
Well, by that definition,
everything's a mental error,

40:28.760 --> 40:30.827
because the mind tells
the body what to do.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.829
Missing a ground ball
could be called a mental error.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.664
Could be, and will be.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.666
-So, everything's mental?
-Pretty much!

40:36.668 --> 40:38.735
Yes! And I sure think that

40:38.737 --> 40:42.138
holding onto the ball,
in right field,
and running around

40:42.140 --> 40:44.507
in what looked like
a figure eight,

40:44.509 --> 40:46.709
while the tying
and the winning runs scored,

40:46.711 --> 40:48.945
qualifies as a big, fat,

40:48.947 --> 40:51.781
stinking mental error!

40:51.783 --> 40:54.517
Well, then I don't know why you
made such a big deal out of

40:54.519 --> 40:56.753
not criticizing the kids
for physical errors

40:56.755 --> 40:59.756
when you don't even believe
such a thing exists.

40:59.758 --> 41:01.124
Coach Don.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.597
That's a good point, Mike.

41:07.599 --> 41:09.065
Why don't we go ahead
and take that up at our

41:09.067 --> 41:11.134
mandatory coaches' meeting
a little later?

41:11.136 --> 41:13.069
Coach! Get your kids out there.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.238
All right, you guys. Choke back
those tears, and go shake hands.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.774
Let's go. All class,
all the time. Let's go.

41:19.244 --> 41:20.510
Proud of you boys!

41:24.082 --> 41:25.849
Say, Mike.

41:25.851 --> 41:27.750
That, uh,

41:27.752 --> 41:30.119
that equipment's not gonna
crawl into the bag
all by itself, is it?

41:41.666 --> 41:44.167
-Oh, buddy. Tough loss, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.703
I'm so proud of you.
You did so well today.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.805
Thanks, Mom.

41:48.807 --> 41:50.507
All right, well, get 'em
next time, right?

41:50.509 --> 41:51.574
-Right.
-Right.

41:57.048 --> 41:58.581
All right, you wanna
get some ice cream?

41:58.583 --> 42:00.783
-Mm-hmm.
-All right, let's go.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.789
[thunder rumbling]

42:38.256 --> 42:41.090
[Don]
Uh, I got it. I got it.

42:41.092 --> 42:42.125
[chuckles]

42:43.061 --> 42:44.193
Well...

42:44.195 --> 42:46.596
what's the protocol
in a thunderstorm?

42:46.598 --> 42:47.630
Catch this.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.333
We wait.

42:50.335 --> 42:51.768
How long do we wait?

42:51.770 --> 42:52.936
Till the commissioner gets here.

42:52.938 --> 42:55.171
He's on a work release program.

42:55.173 --> 42:57.006
The commissioner's a criminal?

42:57.008 --> 42:58.908
That's a harsh word, Mike.

42:58.910 --> 43:01.010
He's a good commissioner,
and nobody wants the job.

43:03.014 --> 43:05.315
Nobody wants to be
a coach either.

43:05.317 --> 43:07.750
Let me, uh... Let me ask you
something there, Mike.

43:08.887 --> 43:11.654
How come you wanted
to be a coach?

43:11.656 --> 43:13.323
Just wanted to have a special
activity with my son.

43:13.325 --> 43:15.275
[chuckling] There...

43:15.276 --> 43:17.226
are other special activities
out there, my friend.

43:17.228 --> 43:19.729
I know. We joined Indian Guides.

43:19.731 --> 43:20.930
That sounds fun.

43:20.932 --> 43:22.799
Not really.

43:22.801 --> 43:24.233
We had to go
camping in the rain.

43:25.670 --> 43:28.071
Call each other only by
our Indian names.

43:28.073 --> 43:30.773
What, uh...
was your Indian name?

43:30.775 --> 43:31.841
Doesn't matter.

43:31.843 --> 43:33.076
Come on, I wanna know.

43:33.078 --> 43:34.711
I'm not gonna tell you.

43:36.815 --> 43:38.247
Was it, uh...

43:40.652 --> 43:42.118
Chief Itchy Itchy Scrotum?

43:43.088 --> 43:44.354
No, it wasn't, Don.

43:46.191 --> 43:47.690
Well, Mike...

43:49.060 --> 43:50.960
until you tell me
your real Indian name,

43:52.631 --> 43:54.263
I'm going to have to call you,

43:54.265 --> 43:55.999
-Chief Itchy Itchy Scrotum.
-[chuckles]

43:56.001 --> 43:57.834
They weren't real Indian names.

43:57.836 --> 43:59.135
They're just the name
assigned to us.

43:59.137 --> 44:00.737
[thunder rumbling]

44:00.739 --> 44:02.305
Can't believe you haven't
fixed that yet.

44:05.110 --> 44:06.976
Why don't you let me pay
for your headlight, Don?

44:07.912 --> 44:08.945
Forget about it, Mike.

44:10.015 --> 44:11.214
Are you ever gonna fix it?

44:11.216 --> 44:13.182
[laughs] Not while we're
on a winning streak.

44:13.184 --> 44:15.284
You're not gonna
fix your headlight
'cause the team is winning?

44:15.286 --> 44:17.120
[chuckling] Pal,

44:17.122 --> 44:18.421
you are obviously
new to baseball.

44:18.423 --> 44:19.956
Get that door and jump in.

44:24.329 --> 44:26.729
[thunder rumbling]

44:26.731 --> 44:27.764
[Michael]
Huh.

44:32.303 --> 44:33.369
Woo!

44:33.371 --> 44:35.738
You have an animal dead in here?

44:39.077 --> 44:40.810
Ah, you haven't changed
your socks, have you?

44:40.812 --> 44:42.712
Not till we lose.

44:42.714 --> 44:44.981
Ah, you really
are superstitious.

44:44.983 --> 44:47.717
Well, I just don't
wanna jinx the team.

44:47.719 --> 44:50.820
You really think there's
a connection between your socks
and how the kids are playing?

44:50.822 --> 44:53.122
Well, it's all about believing,
Mike. That's...

44:53.124 --> 44:55.058
That's what the game's
all about.

44:55.059 --> 44:56.993
God Almighty, I never had
to defend myself with old Tony.

44:56.995 --> 44:58.061
He just...

44:58.997 --> 45:01.064
He just understood.

45:01.066 --> 45:02.398
One time, we're on
a winning streak...

45:02.400 --> 45:04.000
[laughs]

45:04.002 --> 45:06.402
...he goes five weeks

45:06.404 --> 45:08.337
without changing his T-shirt.

45:08.339 --> 45:10.406
Five weeks.

45:10.408 --> 45:13.376
His girlfriend gets hammered,
spills a cup of salsa on it.

45:13.378 --> 45:16.112
He can't wear that T-shirt
to the next game.

45:16.114 --> 45:19.048
We get bombed 8-3.
Thank you, Tony.

45:19.050 --> 45:21.250
Well, I didn't realize you had
solid evidence to back it up.

45:21.252 --> 45:24.253
Last year was
just unbelievable.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.123
We go out, plot strategy,

45:27.125 --> 45:28.925
have three or four
pitchers of beer.

45:28.927 --> 45:31.160
Really, really think
outside the lines.

45:31.162 --> 45:33.129
For the kids.

45:33.131 --> 45:34.964
So, by the end of the year,
we'd be

45:34.966 --> 45:36.733
sitting down at the end
of the bench,

45:36.735 --> 45:39.402
and we would not say...

45:41.172 --> 45:43.506
a word.

45:43.508 --> 45:45.808
I'm okay not talking
if that's what you want.

45:45.810 --> 45:47.510
Oh, hell no, Mike.
You and I don't know

45:47.512 --> 45:49.879
each other well enough
to not talk to each other.

45:50.982 --> 45:52.248
You talk to your wife?

45:57.355 --> 45:59.355
Yeah, not much lately.

45:59.357 --> 46:01.491
A cold front has
moved in the area,

46:01.493 --> 46:03.760
probably from Canada,
thank you very much.

46:03.762 --> 46:05.528
Well, the way you're thinking,

46:06.898 --> 46:08.364
maybe that's a good thing
to not talk.

46:08.366 --> 46:10.333
I don't know about you,
Mike, but...

46:11.770 --> 46:14.003
for me, not talking to a woman's

46:14.005 --> 46:16.172
a whole lot different than
not talking to a normal person.

46:16.174 --> 46:19.041
I can't believe she hasn't come
to a single game yet this year!

46:19.043 --> 46:20.343
Why hasn't she?

46:20.345 --> 46:22.345
I don't know.
She's busy all the time.

46:22.347 --> 46:24.413
I can't keep track
of where she goes.

46:24.415 --> 46:26.549
But...

46:26.551 --> 46:29.852
you gotta be supportive
of every whacked out notion
she comes up with.

46:29.854 --> 46:32.955
The group, the job,
the volunteer,

46:32.957 --> 46:35.458
community, multi-ethnic,
inner-city, non-denominational,

46:35.460 --> 46:37.260
blahdity-blah-blah...

46:39.063 --> 46:41.864
all of which, I respect.

46:47.839 --> 46:50.506
Time goes by
and here we are.

46:50.508 --> 46:53.042
Two guys eating
cookies in the rain.

46:56.548 --> 46:58.514
I haven't even met your wife.
I don't even know her name.

47:01.286 --> 47:02.985
-Barbara.
-Ha!

47:02.987 --> 47:04.320
[laughs]

47:04.322 --> 47:08.157
That... That is unbelievable.

47:08.159 --> 47:10.860
-What, what's unbelievable?
-We're eight games
into the season,

47:10.862 --> 47:12.461
I haven't even met Babs.

47:12.463 --> 47:14.096
Give me a break.
I tell you what!

47:14.098 --> 47:17.133
What do you say you,
me, and Babs,

47:17.135 --> 47:19.202
we go out for--
And I know you don't like beer.

47:19.204 --> 47:21.537
You have your reasons.
This is not a criticism.

47:23.908 --> 47:26.142
What about Babs?
What does she go for?

47:26.144 --> 47:28.077
A little wine cooler?

47:28.079 --> 47:29.912
That her flavor? Huh?

47:29.914 --> 47:31.447
Is that the, the commissioner?

47:31.449 --> 47:33.216
The guy with the thing
on his ankle?

47:33.218 --> 47:34.283
Oh!

47:38.590 --> 47:40.440
[Don]
All right, you guys.

47:40.441 --> 47:42.291
Now we are riding
a six-game winning streak.

47:42.293 --> 47:46.095
Today, there is no reason
not to make it seven.

47:46.097 --> 47:47.363
Okay?

47:47.365 --> 47:49.332
Go Pirates on three.
One, two, three.

47:49.334 --> 47:52.401
[All]
Go Pirates!

47:52.403 --> 47:54.670

[Don]
Here we go, Trusty Rusty.
What do you say, kid?

47:56.941 --> 47:59.942
I like our chances here.
Let's find a way to contribute!

48:01.279 --> 48:03.246
Say, Rusty kid.

48:03.248 --> 48:05.147
[Don] Dead on.
That's what I'm talking about!

48:05.149 --> 48:07.650
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

48:07.652 --> 48:09.185
Come on, kid, pick 'em up,
put 'em down!

48:09.187 --> 48:10.653
Pick 'em up, put 'em down!

Attaboy! Yeah, attaboy.

48:29.941 --> 48:31.307
Way to make something happen!

48:32.243 --> 48:33.609

Don't drop it, don't dro-- Oh!

48:41.953 --> 48:43.319
Hey, I got great news, Eric.

48:43.321 --> 48:45.955
There's still time to sign up
for girls' softball.

48:45.957 --> 48:47.590
I'm sure your mother
would love that.

48:47.592 --> 48:50.326
Hey, everybody, that's my son.
He dropped the ball.

48:50.328 --> 48:51.694
Way to go, son.

48:58.536 --> 49:01.437

Yeah!

Now pitching for the Royals,

50:31.496 --> 50:32.728
Burt Shilling.

50:36.567 --> 50:39.201
Hey, blue? One second.
Just one second.

50:39.203 --> 50:41.203
How, uh...

50:41.205 --> 50:42.705
How old would you say
the pitcher is?

50:43.641 --> 50:44.673
[Umpire] Twelve.

50:44.675 --> 50:46.242
Do you know he drove
to the game,

50:46.244 --> 50:48.177
-and he hangs out
at the VFW, Ump?
-Let's play ball!

50:48.179 --> 50:49.545
[stammers] Honest to God, blue,

50:49.547 --> 50:51.247
someone should check
his birth certificate.

50:51.249 --> 50:53.115
This is all
about the kids, blue.

50:53.117 --> 50:54.550
It's not all about
the young adults!

50:54.552 --> 50:56.285
[Michael]
He can't help his size.

50:56.287 --> 50:57.486
All right, here we go,
Frankie kid.

50:57.488 --> 50:59.155
Let's get a little
something going today.

50:59.157 --> 51:00.656
[Michael]
Hey hey, attaboy.

51:00.658 --> 51:02.458
That's my baseball player.

51:02.460 --> 51:03.826
[sniffing]
You know what I smell?

51:03.828 --> 51:06.128
A hit, Frankie. I smell a hit.

51:06.130 --> 51:07.196
Here we go, kid.

51:07.198 --> 51:08.697
Stay in. Stay in.

51:11.569 --> 51:13.602
-Ball!
-Oh, Frankie! Frankie!

51:13.604 --> 51:16.772
You're bailing.
I want you to plant it and turn.

51:16.774 --> 51:18.774
Right now, you're acting like
you're a little scared.

51:18.776 --> 51:20.609
And I know you're not
'cause it's Frankie Day.

51:20.611 --> 51:22.411
He is not gonna hit you, kid.

51:22.413 --> 51:23.746
Stay in there.
Listen to Coach Don.

51:23.748 --> 51:26.348
He is not gonna hit you.
Here we go.

51:31.389 --> 51:32.455

51:32.457 --> 51:33.722
-[Umpire] Time!
-Oh!

51:33.724 --> 51:36.192
Oh! Dear God.

51:36.194 --> 51:38.594
[Umpire] You okay?
You all right, buddy?
Come on.

51:38.596 --> 51:39.829
[Don]
All right, pal.

51:39.831 --> 51:41.464
You okay, buddy?

51:43.167 --> 51:44.400
[crowd applauding]

51:45.570 --> 51:47.403
All right. Way to use your head.

51:47.405 --> 51:49.472
Attaboy, attaboy.

51:49.474 --> 51:51.457
Way to tough it out.

51:51.458 --> 51:53.441
That slight ringing sensation
you have in your ear,

51:53.444 --> 51:55.211
that's perfectly natural
right now.

51:57.748 --> 51:59.281
Here's the situation.

51:59.283 --> 52:02.885
I got one away.
You are my tying run, okay?

52:02.887 --> 52:04.453
If that ball's in the ground,

52:04.455 --> 52:06.288
I want you to hippity-hop
to the barbershop.

52:06.290 --> 52:07.857
You understand? All right, good.

52:07.859 --> 52:10.259
All right, Kahil.
Get that elbow up!

52:10.261 --> 52:12.595
Frankie, one, two, three,
look at me.

52:12.597 --> 52:14.196
What do we say?
We get what we get...

52:14.198 --> 52:15.264
[Both]
and we don't fret.

52:15.266 --> 52:17.066
That's right.
If you need to cry,

52:17.067 --> 52:18.867
I want you to wait till the end
of the inning. You understand?

52:18.870 --> 52:20.520
-Mm-hmm.
-All right, kid.

52:20.521 --> 52:22.171
Gimme two steps.
One, two. There you go.

52:22.907 --> 52:24.173

Don't watch the ball!
It's gonna drop!

52:31.349 --> 52:33.249
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

52:34.886 --> 52:36.785
-Oh, Frankie!
-Oh! Oh!

52:36.787 --> 52:38.621
Frankie, get back!

52:38.623 --> 52:40.523
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! Back!

52:40.525 --> 52:42.491
Frankie, get back! Get back!
Get back! Get back!

52:42.493 --> 52:44.860
Don't get doubled up!
Get down! Get down!

Oh!

52:52.370 --> 52:53.536
Gah!

52:53.538 --> 52:54.703
[Michael]
Good game, everybody.

52:57.909 --> 52:59.441
My fault.

52:59.443 --> 53:00.576
Okay?

53:00.578 --> 53:02.444
My fault.

53:02.446 --> 53:03.579
Gah!

53:06.284 --> 53:07.650
Line up. Shake hands.

53:08.586 --> 53:09.852
Here we go.

53:09.854 --> 53:11.554
Hey, quick question, Don.

53:11.556 --> 53:13.656
Was that a physical error
or a mental error?

53:13.658 --> 53:16.458
Well, I guess since you weren't
out on the field,
it couldn't be a physical error.

53:16.460 --> 53:17.726
So it must have been a mental.

53:17.728 --> 53:19.228
Shut up, Mike.

53:19.230 --> 53:21.363
I exercised poor judgment
and I let down the team.

53:21.365 --> 53:23.732
Oh, come on, it's our first loss
since opening day.

53:23.734 --> 53:24.800
Everybody played great.

53:24.802 --> 53:26.769
Except you.
You didn't even play!

53:26.771 --> 53:28.604
What the hell is wrong with you?

53:28.606 --> 53:30.673
I'm just trying to be a pal.
Cheer you up.

53:30.675 --> 53:33.409
Well, stop it.

53:33.411 --> 53:35.611
What kind of man are you,
losing doesn't bother you?

53:35.613 --> 53:37.713
Tell me... Tell me something.

53:39.850 --> 53:41.584
-Why are you here?
-What?

53:41.586 --> 53:43.285
Making fun of me.

53:43.287 --> 53:44.720
Making fun of the game
of baseball.

53:44.722 --> 53:46.322
I am not making fun.

53:46.324 --> 53:49.525
I, I am just--
I'm thrilled to be here.

53:49.527 --> 53:50.759
To be a part of this.

53:50.761 --> 53:52.761
I was the kid
who never got picked.

53:52.763 --> 53:54.396
Ended up watching
from the sidelines.

53:54.398 --> 53:56.365
I don't want Frankie to be
the kid who never gets picked.

53:56.367 --> 53:58.267
That's why I'm here.

53:58.269 --> 54:01.737
I hope this is a rich
and fulfilling experience,

54:01.739 --> 54:02.838
for the both of you.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.741
You know,
you don't own baseball, Don.

54:05.743 --> 54:07.910
Let me and my kid have
a little piece of it, okay?

54:10.314 --> 54:12.381
¶ ¶

54:24.362 --> 54:25.628
You seen the other shin guard?

54:26.664 --> 54:27.997
God, I do everything
around here.

54:28.933 --> 54:30.633
And not for nothing, but...

54:30.635 --> 54:33.535
who else brought snacks
this year?

54:33.537 --> 54:36.772
Answer. Nobody.

54:36.774 --> 54:38.674
Well, I didn't know you were
bringing all the snacks.

54:38.676 --> 54:40.409
Well, now you do.

54:40.411 --> 54:43.679
Snacks are an integral part of
these kids' baseball experience.

54:43.681 --> 54:45.514
Let me ask you something there,
Mike. How come...

54:46.917 --> 54:49.785
you never bring snacks?

54:49.787 --> 54:52.488
I mean, I accept that
you are damn sure

54:52.490 --> 54:55.291
not gonna come up with
any brilliant game strategies,

54:55.293 --> 54:58.727
but how about a little word
across the pillow to Babs

54:58.729 --> 55:00.929
that just
the littlest contribution

55:00.931 --> 55:03.999
-would be very
greatly appreciated.
-Her name's Barbara.

55:04.001 --> 55:07.503
If she doesn't want to come
to a single game
all season, fine.

55:07.505 --> 55:08.871
I don't judge someone's

55:08.873 --> 55:11.440
lack of interest
in their own kid. But...

55:11.442 --> 55:14.310
oh my goodness, at least
she could go to a grocery store,

55:14.312 --> 55:15.711
and maybe pick up some crap

55:15.713 --> 55:17.646
and show the kids
we really care.

55:17.648 --> 55:19.315
My wife's dead, Don.

55:19.317 --> 55:20.716
What?

55:21.652 --> 55:23.719
Barbara, my wife.

55:24.655 --> 55:25.788
She's dead.

55:27.758 --> 55:30.359
What are you talking about?
When did this happen?

55:30.361 --> 55:32.361
Oh, year ago.

55:35.066 --> 55:36.732
Babs is dead,

55:36.734 --> 55:39.335
and I didn't even
get to meet her.

55:39.337 --> 55:42.037
[sighs]
I'll bring snacks
to the next game.

55:42.039 --> 55:43.372
I didn't know I was supposed to.

55:43.374 --> 55:44.973
Oh now, Jesus Christ, Mikey!

55:44.975 --> 55:46.842
And don't call me Mikey!

55:46.844 --> 55:47.910
Or Mike.

55:47.912 --> 55:49.411
My name's Michael.

55:49.413 --> 55:50.679
All right?
Is that too much to ask?

55:50.681 --> 55:52.381
Well, why couldn't you
tell me about your wife?

55:52.383 --> 55:53.849
'Cause I didn't wanna
tell you about my wife!

55:53.851 --> 55:55.384
I just wanted to be
the assistant coach!

55:55.386 --> 55:57.920
Oh, I see.
So, I can just ramble on,

55:57.922 --> 55:59.922
like some kind of
five-star asshole

55:59.924 --> 56:01.874
about how she should
bring snacks,

56:01.875 --> 56:03.825
and maybe we should, we should
go out for wine coolers.

56:03.828 --> 56:05.060
It's okay.

56:05.062 --> 56:07.429
Yeah, it's okay for you!
I feel like a jerk!

56:07.431 --> 56:08.964
Listen, Mike, Mikey...

56:10.134 --> 56:12.067
Michael!

56:12.068 --> 56:14.001
If you keep it all bottled up
in this ball of stress,

56:14.004 --> 56:16.638
it is going to build
and it is going to build,

56:16.640 --> 56:17.873
-and then one day...
-[roof clatters]

56:17.875 --> 56:19.508
...it's going to explode,

56:19.510 --> 56:21.477
and it will kill you.

56:21.479 --> 56:22.578
That's none of my business.

56:22.580 --> 56:24.880
I don't judge.
The real question is,

56:24.882 --> 56:28.450
how am I supposed to know
who the guy is sitting
next to me on the bench?

56:28.452 --> 56:31.887
-I told you.
-It only took you eight games.

56:31.889 --> 56:34.890
About the only time
I don't think about her
is when I'm here.

56:36.660 --> 56:38.093
And I'm tired, Don.

56:39.497 --> 56:40.562
I need a break.

56:47.772 --> 56:49.004
Where's Frank's father?

56:49.006 --> 56:50.439
[Michael] Nepal.

56:51.475 --> 56:53.041
Nepal? The--

56:53.978 --> 56:55.077
The one in Nepal?

56:55.079 --> 56:56.645
That's the one.

56:56.647 --> 56:58.147
Been on a pilgrimage
for seven years.

56:58.149 --> 57:01.016
[laughing] Man...

57:01.018 --> 57:02.718
I'd like to go on
a damn pilgrimage.

57:02.720 --> 57:04.787
Where do I sign up
for my pilgrimage?

57:04.789 --> 57:07.156
So, I'm Frankie's dad.

57:09.994 --> 57:11.460
Well, that's good.

57:11.462 --> 57:13.729
-He's a smart kid.
-[stammers]

57:13.731 --> 57:15.130
Why do you say that though?

57:15.132 --> 57:17.466
I mean, he's never picked up
a drill on the first try.

57:17.468 --> 57:19.735
He doesn't even know
what a cutoff man is. Still.

57:19.737 --> 57:22.204
I, I don't know.

57:22.206 --> 57:24.773
Maybe it's the glasses
or the way he always
walks around.

57:24.775 --> 57:26.809
I, I, I don't know.
He just seems like a smart--

57:26.811 --> 57:29.711
Wh-- wh-- why is everything
such a big mystery with you?

57:29.713 --> 57:31.814
Your dead wife.
Your kid's father.

57:31.816 --> 57:32.948
Your real Indian name.

57:32.950 --> 57:35.451
-Where is Frankie?
-Just...

57:37.788 --> 57:39.154
Oh, he's already in the car.

57:48.699 --> 57:50.599
¶ ¶

57:51.635 --> 57:53.602
You can do this, Jimmy.

58:05.649 --> 58:08.183
Attaboy! Here we go!

58:08.185 --> 58:09.818
Complete game, Jimmy.
Complete game.

Oh! Stay down, stay down.

58:43.787 --> 58:46.688
[Michael]
Nice hustle! Come on,
you kidding?

58:46.690 --> 58:48.223
[Don]
Way to hustle, kid!

58:48.225 --> 58:49.625
[Michael]
Come on, Eric!

[Boy]
Come on, Jimmy!

59:20.024 --> 59:21.957
-Strike!
-Attaboy!

59:21.959 --> 59:23.992
Attaboy, Jimmy.
You're pitching a gem here.

59:23.994 --> 59:26.094
You never looked better.
You're throwing aspirin.

59:26.096 --> 59:27.629
It's blue smoke out there, baby.

59:29.300 --> 59:30.766
Strike two!

59:30.768 --> 59:32.200
[Don] Oh my goodness gracious.

59:32.202 --> 59:34.570
Jimmy's just
an unbelievable talent.

59:34.572 --> 59:36.104
I've never been
prouder of you, Jimmy.

59:36.106 --> 59:37.639
You have never looked better!

59:37.641 --> 59:38.941
Come on, son, here we go!

59:38.943 --> 59:40.275
Shut 'er down!

59:40.277 --> 59:41.877
[Boy]
You strike him out, Jimmy!

59:44.315 --> 59:45.747
-Got him!
-[laughing, cheering]

59:47.017 --> 59:48.717
[Don]
Way to go, Pirates.

59:48.719 --> 59:50.686
Great win.

59:50.688 --> 59:52.955
Bring it in, fellas.
Bring it in, fellas.

59:52.957 --> 59:55.657
[cheering]

59:55.659 --> 59:57.359
[Don]
Go Pirates on three.
One, two, three.

59:57.361 --> 59:59.895
Go Pirates!

59:59.897 --> 01:00:00.929
Yeah!

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.264
All right, line up
and shake hands!

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.903
¶ ¶

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:17.346
Hey, buddy.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:21.683
What's on your mind?

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:24.119
Well...

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.173
I was thinking.

01:00:28.174 --> 01:00:29.957
There's only maybe
three kids on our team

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.693
who can make it
to the Majors someday.

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:34.997
Jimmy,

01:00:34.999 --> 01:00:36.365
Eric,

01:00:36.367 --> 01:00:37.933
and Timor.

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:43.038
You-- You think
I'll ever get a hit?

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:47.809
All I know is
you get better every day, Champ.

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:50.212
Yeah?

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.148
Wanna play some catch?

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:54.783
-Sure.
-Here.

01:00:54.785 --> 01:00:55.817
Let's practice.

01:01:01.392 --> 01:01:02.958
[chuckling]

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.026
Here you go.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.095
Boom!

01:01:08.232 --> 01:01:09.297
Nice.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:14.670
-[ball smacks glove]
-Whoa, did you hear that?

01:01:14.672 --> 01:01:16.905
-Yeah, it was like a...
-Pepper.

01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:19.374
I see.

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:20.942
Try this guy on for size.

01:01:20.944 --> 01:01:22.811
Oop! Well.

01:01:22.813 --> 01:01:25.347
That was a tricky bounce,
but try to get your glove

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:27.015
all the way down
on those ground balls, Frank.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.784
-Okay?
-Got it.

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:30.318
Throw home!

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.920
Oh!

01:01:31.922 --> 01:01:32.988
Aah!

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:34.189
Out!

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.273
I'm really sorry, Dad.

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:54.810
Lookit, uh...

01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:57.979
I'm not gonna put
any pressure on you.

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:03.051
But before you open that door,
I just want you to think.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:05.487
I want you to go ahead
and think about all the things

01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:07.422
that I've told you.

01:02:09.426 --> 01:02:11.827
This is for the rest
of your life.

01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:15.997
Pick me up at 7:30?

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:19.768
Yeah.

01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:33.482
[sighs]

01:02:33.484 --> 01:02:35.016
[Michael]
Nice work, nice work.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.986
Woo!

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:39.020
Good catch, good catch!

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:40.989
Woo!

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:44.226
Well, hello, Coach Don.

01:02:44.228 --> 01:02:45.427
About to give up on you.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:47.763
My one rule on tardiness.

01:02:47.765 --> 01:02:49.531
Everyone can be late once.

01:02:51.168 --> 01:02:52.968
[whistle trills]

01:02:59.143 --> 01:03:00.342
All right, fellas, today...

01:03:02.045 --> 01:03:04.379
Today we're gonna give more
of you guys a chance to pitch.

01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:05.947
How does that sound?

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:07.282
[Boys]
Yeah!

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:10.252
Where's Jimmy?

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:12.053
Jimmy won't be with us anymore.

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:13.155
[stammers]

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.424
-Is he okay?
-Some, uh...

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:21.263
Some of you have heard
the rumors at school. Sadly...

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:23.498
they're all true.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.100
My Jimmy has...

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:27.068
gone and gotten himself
a part in Brigadoon.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:29.371
Apparently, he feels his skills
are best used in service

01:03:29.373 --> 01:03:31.373
to the American musical theater.

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:33.392
Now,

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.410
there is a proud tradition
in baseball...

01:03:36.947 --> 01:03:38.880
of rising above tragedy.

01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:41.583
Which is just exactly what
I wanna see you guys do.

01:03:41.585 --> 01:03:43.518
And let's go out
and win another championship.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.087
-What do you say? Let's go
loosen up those arms! Come on!
-[Kids] Yeah!

01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:47.823
Lemme see who wants to pitch!

01:03:47.825 --> 01:03:50.992
[siren wailing]

01:04:00.904 --> 01:04:02.404
Great.

01:04:04.241 --> 01:04:06.875
-Got you! Didn't I?
-Oh! Geez Louise!

01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:09.845
Bullshit! I knew it was you,
Tony! Come on.

01:04:09.847 --> 01:04:11.947
Don't arrest me, Officer!
I didn't do anything wrong!

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:14.482
Yeah, right, I am so sure.

01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:16.117
What's happening?
What, do you have a date?

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:17.152
No, I...

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:19.621
I have to go to Parents' Night.

01:04:19.623 --> 01:04:21.056
Pfft! Loser.

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:24.793
Doesn't Linda do that?

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:27.595
Well, she has the flu.
Or... she says she has the flu.

01:04:27.598 --> 01:04:29.364
So, she's at home
while you're off to school?

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.466
Yes.

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:33.335
-Just doesn't seem right.
-Tell me about it.

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:36.171
Hey, uh...

01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:37.472
You wanna grab a beer later?

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:40.041
-[sighs] I gotta work, pal.
-Ah...

01:04:40.978 --> 01:04:42.143
-See you around.
-All right.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.312
Fair enough.

01:04:44.314 --> 01:04:45.447
[starts engine]

01:05:00.197 --> 01:05:01.229
[sighs]

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:02.264
You okay, Coach?

01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:06.101
Oh. Yeah, I, I just...

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:08.270
Yeah, you look like you
don't wanna go to school.

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:10.472
[chuckling]

01:05:10.474 --> 01:05:13.074
Ten-minute classes
and I still get bored.

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:17.078
I was just wondering if you
were gonna keep coaching.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.180
What do you mean,
because of Jimmy?

01:05:21.652 --> 01:05:22.684
Sure.

01:05:24.054 --> 01:05:25.420
I can't let my guys down, right?

01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:28.590
That's great.

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:34.229
Because you're doing
a wonderful job with these kids.

01:05:35.399 --> 01:05:36.998
Thank you.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.533
Now, lemme tell you
something about your Timmy.

01:05:38.535 --> 01:05:40.268
That's a pretty special kid.

01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:42.404
Honest.

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:46.074
I guarantee you...

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:46.941
he is gonna get a hit
one of these games.

01:05:46.944 --> 01:05:48.343
I guarantee you.

01:05:49.646 --> 01:05:53.315
[sighs] Well, maybe we'll
have some classes together.

01:05:53.317 --> 01:05:56.351
¶ ¶

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:02.524
What?

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:08.530
Oh my God.

01:06:11.068 --> 01:06:13.468
What was that?

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:16.638
[cheering]

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:22.711
What do you say, Timmy Tim?

01:06:22.713 --> 01:06:26.514
Tic-tack-toe! Timmy's my guy!
We say Timmy! Here we go, kid!

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.235
-Ball!
-Nothing but strikes, Timmy!

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:32.153
Timmy, Timmy, Timmy, Timmy,
Timmy, Timmy, Timmy, Timski!

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:33.188
Here we go!

01:06:34.358 --> 01:06:36.391
You're really on the Timmy
bandwagon today.

01:06:36.393 --> 01:06:38.760
Little thing called
quid pro quo.

01:06:38.762 --> 01:06:40.028
What's that?

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:41.629
[Don]
Me and Mrs. Timmy.

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:43.365
Parents' Night.

01:06:43.367 --> 01:06:44.699
My wife had the flu,

01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:46.551
and Mr. Timmy is...

01:06:46.552 --> 01:06:48.402
Living in the city
with a yoga instructor. Yeah.

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:51.589
Right.

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:53.540
So, we went ahead
and hunkered down in her Subaru,

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:55.643
in the very darkest part
of the parking lot.

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:57.479
Here we go, Timmy kid!
What do you say?

01:06:58.415 --> 01:06:59.447
[Umpire]
Ball two!

01:06:59.449 --> 01:07:00.582
So, what happened?

01:07:00.584 --> 01:07:02.117
What do you think happened?

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:04.419
Don, you're married.

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:06.054
Your point is...?

01:07:06.056 --> 01:07:07.288
You shouldn't be
doing that stuff.

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:08.456
What, you think
I don't know that?

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:10.258
I'm only human,
and so is Mrs. Timmy.

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.659
You know,
I can't help but think

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:14.229
that if my wife took
better care of herself,

01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:15.764
she wouldn't have
gotten the flu,

01:07:15.766 --> 01:07:18.366
and she wouldn't have put me in
that position with Mrs. Timmy.

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:19.401
Ball four!

01:07:19.403 --> 01:07:21.636
Hey, blue, timeout! [whistles]

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:27.776
[humming]

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:31.479
[mouths]

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:36.718
You could totally
take me out, Coach.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.787
I'm not gonna do that,
Timmy, and I'll tell you why.

01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:41.322
'Cause I know for a fact,
if you bear down right now,

01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:43.291
you can get us
out of this inning.

01:07:43.293 --> 01:07:45.226
And I'm never wrong
about that stuff.

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:47.228
Now, you are a madman.
You are a beast.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:48.530
-Who's the beast inside you?
-Lewis.

01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:50.665
Lewis. Hey, Lewis,
tell me you're a beast.

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:52.600
-I'm a beast. A beast.
-You're a beast. You're a beast.

01:07:52.602 --> 01:07:53.835
-I'm a beast. I'm a beast!
-Beast!

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:55.336
-You're gonna pitch
like a beast!
-Yeah!

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:56.771
You're a beast! Go get them!
Come on, Lewis!

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:00.642
[Don]
All right, come on, Timbo!

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:03.211
What do you say, kid?
Just throw to the mitt.

01:08:03.213 --> 01:08:04.479
Let your teammates do the work.

01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:06.347
Here we go, kid, all about you!

01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:08.116
How, uh...

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:10.452
How'd you know
Mr. Timmy lives in the city?

01:08:11.555 --> 01:08:12.821
She told me.

01:08:12.823 --> 01:08:14.272
She hangs out.

01:08:14.273 --> 01:08:15.722
Helps me put equipment
in the car sometimes.

01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:19.359
[Don]
Well, you are in sweet shape,
my friend.

01:08:19.362 --> 01:08:20.795
You got a desperate divorcée,

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:22.529
hanging on by a thread,

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:24.499
and a dead wife?

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.201
Which is just

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:27.669
money in the bank.

01:08:27.671 --> 01:08:31.506
You are living my dream.
You are.

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:34.375
You really are.

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:37.145
All right, you guys!
Show some character!

01:08:37.147 --> 01:08:38.880
Life's about character!
Here we go!

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.853
[cheering]

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:47.689
Strike!

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.426
[jackhammer rattling]

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.566
[phone ringing]

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.736
-[beeps]
-Hi, Roger.

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:03.171
[Roger]
Michael, from now on,

01:09:03.173 --> 01:09:04.606
you need to tell me
if you're leaving early.

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:09.377
I did. I told you I had
baseball practice

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:13.214
and that I'd be coming in
early in the morning
to make up the time.

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:14.582
[Roger]
I got a lot on my plate,
buddy boy.

01:09:14.584 --> 01:09:15.917
You need to make it
crystal clear.

01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:18.386
I understand.

01:09:18.388 --> 01:09:21.555
I'll, uh, I'll send a memo
next time, okay? Bye.

01:09:21.558 --> 01:09:22.657
Asshole!

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:25.894
Michael?

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:28.162
Hi, Roger. Sorry, this guy
just cut me off. Asshole!

01:09:28.165 --> 01:09:29.663
-Yeah, you!
-[honks horn]

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:30.932
Ugh!

01:09:30.934 --> 01:09:33.600
Uh, anything else
I can help you with?

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:35.803
-We'll talk in the morning.
-Okay!

01:09:35.805 --> 01:09:37.505
-Bye!
-[beeps]

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:41.876
No, sorry. I'm... Sorry.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.747
[Don]
I am so proud of you guys.

01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:47.381
Granted,

01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:50.718
you're not the most talented
players I've ever seen.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.920
You drop fly balls.

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.587
You throw wild. You strike out.

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:56.558
And I don't recall seeing
a team at any level that cries

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.659
as much as you do.

01:09:57.661 --> 01:10:00.528
But... you played
your hearts out,

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:02.864
and you made the playoffs.

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:04.766
-Nice going.
-Yeah.

01:10:04.768 --> 01:10:06.467
Every team makes
the playoffs though, right?

01:10:06.469 --> 01:10:08.770
Technically, that's true,
Michael,

01:10:08.772 --> 01:10:11.773
but let's not detract
from what these young men
have accomplished.

01:10:11.775 --> 01:10:13.708
Incidentally,
you're in violation of our

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:16.244
first rule about
getting here on time.

01:10:16.246 --> 01:10:18.313
-I let you know
24 hours in advance--
-No, you didn't,

01:10:18.315 --> 01:10:21.249
but we'll take that up at our
coaches' meeting after practice.

01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:23.885
Now, how do we succeed

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:25.620
in the playoffs? Answer.

01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:28.890
By winning games.
And how do we win games?

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:32.927
Answer. By scoring more runs
than the other team.

01:10:32.929 --> 01:10:35.230
Which is why we are instituting

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:37.832
a new and exciting strategy,

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:40.235
for the playoffs.

01:10:40.237 --> 01:10:41.469
Pirates, bring it in.

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:45.540
This strategy is so secret,

01:10:45.542 --> 01:10:47.642
I don't even want you to
tell your parents about it.

01:10:47.644 --> 01:10:48.910
Can you be trusted?

01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:50.912
[kids murmuring] Yes, sir.

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:52.247
As you were.

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:53.681
¶ ¶

01:10:58.455 --> 01:10:59.954
This...

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:02.423
is our new signal.

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:05.693
As soon as you get on base,
you look at me.

01:11:05.695 --> 01:11:08.429
If you see that my hat
is turned around like this,

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:10.265
when you get to the next base,

01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:15.270
you slide and pretend
that you injured your leg.

01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:17.872
Hold onto it. Yell.

01:11:17.874 --> 01:11:20.608
Squirt a few tears.
That shouldn't be a stretch
for most of you.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:23.444
And why do I want you
to do this?

01:11:24.381 --> 01:11:26.014
So that I can take you out,

01:11:26.016 --> 01:11:27.649
and put a faster runner in,

01:11:27.651 --> 01:11:29.484
and maybe score a run

01:11:29.486 --> 01:11:32.020
that we wouldn't
have gotten otherwise.

01:11:32.022 --> 01:11:36.791
This is a very special strategy,

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.693
for our slower runners.

01:11:38.695 --> 01:11:41.362
Rusty, you would be
a top candidate.

01:11:41.364 --> 01:11:43.364
And if lightning should strike,

01:11:43.366 --> 01:11:45.633
and Frankie, you happen
to find yourself on base,

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.535
I want you to go ahead
and clean your glasses off

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:48.936
and take a look at my hat.

01:11:48.938 --> 01:11:51.439
This isn't a strategy.
This is cheating.

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:54.075
I have no problem if you stopped
talking right now, Michael.

01:11:54.077 --> 01:11:57.011
[Michael] If we can't find
a way to win fair and square,
I, for one, would rather lose.

01:11:57.013 --> 01:12:00.548
You cannot stand in front of
people in their formative years,

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:02.817
and say that you would,
"rather lose."

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:04.652
-I would rather lose than cheat.
-Oh, please don't,

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:07.388
please don't waste our time
quoting from the handbook
of curling.

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:09.357
This is baseball.

01:12:09.359 --> 01:12:10.491
This is wrong.

01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:12.560
One, two, three, look at me.

01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:16.631
All right, Pirates.
We're gonna start the practice

01:12:16.633 --> 01:12:20.335
by taking a nice long lap
around the field.

01:12:20.337 --> 01:12:21.703
I have decided to move up

01:12:21.705 --> 01:12:23.771
our coaches' meeting
to a little earlier.

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:24.839
Here we go. Let's go.

01:12:26.109 --> 01:12:27.642
[whistle] Hustle!

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:33.614
We lost our best player.

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:36.684
I feel responsible
that it's my kid,

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:39.754
who's putting on makeup
and prancing around in tights,

01:12:39.756 --> 01:12:43.024
instead of whiffing guys
with his fastball.

01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:44.759
I'm trying to make up
for that loss.

01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:46.711
Just let 'em play.

01:12:46.712 --> 01:12:48.662
-You ever read
the rulebook, Michael?
-No.

01:12:48.665 --> 01:12:51.583
Well, let me tell you something.

01:12:51.584 --> 01:12:54.502
My strategy is fully sanctioned
by the Ripken rulebook.

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:57.772
An injured baserunner
may be replaced--

01:12:57.774 --> 01:12:59.674
But they're not
actually injured!

01:12:59.676 --> 01:13:01.576
-They're acting injured!
-Acting?

01:13:01.578 --> 01:13:02.643
¶ ¶

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:03.911
Is that a shot at my Jimmy?

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:06.414
What? No! No,
it's a shot at you!

01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:07.648
For being so obsessed
with winning

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:09.083
that you're gonna teach
these kids to cheat.

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:10.518
I'm warning you.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.520
You have been no help all year.

01:13:12.522 --> 01:13:15.123
I have done everything.

01:13:15.125 --> 01:13:17.058
Snacks, schedules, fungoes.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:19.093
Oh! You're still mad
about the headlight!

01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:22.029
The only reason you offered
to pay for my headlight

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:24.932
was to show that
you were the guy with
the high dollar value

01:13:24.934 --> 01:13:27.835
-and I was the jerk with a van!
-That is so wrong.

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:30.371
Always on the phone,

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:32.906
making calls that are so much
more important than the kids.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.976
I, I talk on the phone to Roger,

01:13:34.978 --> 01:13:38.146
my boss, who's 24,
loves to boss me around.

01:13:38.148 --> 01:13:39.714
I used to have an okay job,

01:13:39.716 --> 01:13:42.016
before they busted me down
for missing too much work.

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:44.919
Tardy? Stuck in that
unbelievable traffic?

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:47.054
I missed a lot of days
when my wife was sick.

01:13:47.056 --> 01:13:50.792
Oh, you just cannot wait to play
that trump card, can you?

01:13:50.794 --> 01:13:52.894
The reason why I was late today
was 'cause I had to make sure

01:13:52.896 --> 01:13:54.896
Roger's desk got here on time.

01:13:54.898 --> 01:13:56.798
Does that sound like
a big shot job to you?

01:13:58.868 --> 01:14:00.418
All you had to do was call.

01:14:00.419 --> 01:14:01.969
I did call! I called Linda!
Your wife.

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:05.573
Nice try, but she was
at book club last night,
and it ran late.

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:07.508
They got in an argument
about The Da Vinci Code.

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:09.977
She was not even home
until 11:30.

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:11.846
I called at 7:30.

01:14:11.848 --> 01:14:14.232
You tell her
you were gonna be late?

01:14:14.233 --> 01:14:16.617
Well, I tried, but she said
she was on the other line
and would get back to me.

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:19.187
-Did she?
-Well, what happened was,
she got back on my line,

01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:22.824
-obviously thinking she'd
switched over to the other line.
-Why do you think that?

01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:25.493
Because she said, "I'll meet you
at the usual place!"

01:14:27.864 --> 01:14:29.464
Who was she talking to?

01:14:29.466 --> 01:14:30.649
I don't know!

01:14:30.650 --> 01:14:31.833
She was on her line,
I was on my line.

01:14:31.835 --> 01:14:33.034
-It was all rolled up.
-Oh no, no...

01:14:33.036 --> 01:14:34.769
What name did she use?

01:14:34.771 --> 01:14:36.838
-She didn't use a name.
-Yes, she did!

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.173
Don... Eh-- The kids!

01:14:39.175 --> 01:14:42.076

Run. Go ahead, all the way
to field D. Let's go!

[Michael]
Hey, I don't wanna fight.
Are we gonna fight?

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:50.218
Of course not, pal.

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.819
-Hey!
-Take off the mask.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:54.522
-No. No!
-Tell me what Linda said.

01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:56.023
What if--
What if I don't?

01:14:56.025 --> 01:14:57.992
-Then I'll kill you.
But we are not gonna fight.
-Don, no!

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:01.229
[Michael]
Jesus! Ah!

01:15:03.867 --> 01:15:05.533
Don!

01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:07.201
I thought you said
we weren't gonna fight.

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:09.103
Well, don't fight back
and we won't be fighting.

01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:10.905
-What did she say?
-Help...

01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:12.206
-Come on!
-...me.

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:14.842
What did she say?

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:17.512
She said I'll meet you
at the usual place,

01:15:17.514 --> 01:15:18.946
TB.

01:15:18.948 --> 01:15:20.281
-TB?
-I think so...

01:15:20.283 --> 01:15:21.782
Huh?

[coughing] Hey, Don.

01:15:58.955 --> 01:16:00.254
Maybe there's some kind
of explanation.

01:16:00.256 --> 01:16:03.057
-Of course there is.
-Well, there you go!

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:04.559
What do you think it is?

01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:06.193
Either they're planning
a surprise party for me

01:16:06.195 --> 01:16:07.962
or my best friend
is banging my wife.

01:16:09.299 --> 01:16:12.233
Boy, wouldn't it be great
if it's a surprise party.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:13.901
[whistle trills]

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:19.106
Hey, everybody.

01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:21.208
So, Coach Don had
to leave early.

01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:24.712
So, I guess that
makes me the coach.

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:26.981
I know that was a long run.
It's pretty hot out here.

01:16:26.983 --> 01:16:29.350
So, if any of you
are feeling faint,
feel free to sit down.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.954
All right.
Every single one of you.

01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:35.690
Well, when you're
feeling better,

01:16:35.692 --> 01:16:37.925
we're gonna have
batting practice.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:40.761
Uh, first one to touch
home plate bats first.

Is it okay I just
dropped by like this?

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:41.849
I guess it'll have to be.

01:18:41.851 --> 01:18:43.451
I heard you were

to get in touch--

I'm so nervous,

-Here. Put your hand...

Ready? Okay.

01:19:48.151 --> 01:19:50.050
Hey, Coach!
Let's get a runner in there.

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:53.154
-Uh... Timor! Take second!
-Oh! My leg...

01:19:53.156 --> 01:19:55.356
-Yeah! Run, run, run, run, run.
-[cheering]

01:19:55.358 --> 01:19:56.791
[Michael]
I put Timor in.

01:19:56.793 --> 01:19:58.559
He steals third,

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:00.261
steals home,

01:20:00.263 --> 01:20:01.929
and we win.

01:20:06.068 --> 01:20:09.436
So, in other words,
my substitute runner strategy

01:20:10.373 --> 01:20:11.839
worked, huh?

01:20:13.376 --> 01:20:15.309
By accident. Yeah.

01:20:20.817 --> 01:20:22.249
That's not totally bad, Michael.

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:25.920
That's not totally bad.

01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:29.423
Listen, Don, if there's
anything I can do...

01:20:30.359 --> 01:20:32.159
If you wanna take a shower.

01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:36.197
Thanks. But...

01:20:39.068 --> 01:20:40.868
Me and Linda,
we're gonna work it out.

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:42.236
Really?

01:20:42.238 --> 01:20:44.171
Wow, okay!

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:45.239
Yeah.

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:47.241
Yeah.

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:49.276
We all screw up, right?

01:20:50.313 --> 01:20:52.046
And there have been times,

01:20:52.048 --> 01:20:54.348
when I've done things
with people, women people,

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:56.884
that, technically,
I should not have.

01:20:56.886 --> 01:20:59.103
The point is,

01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:01.321
we have to learn to forgive
each other and ourselves.

01:21:01.324 --> 01:21:05.259
So, that we don't let a few
mistakes ruin our lives.

01:21:05.261 --> 01:21:06.360
So...

01:21:07.997 --> 01:21:09.196
We're gonna give it
another shot.

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:12.099
Oh boy, am I glad to hear that.

01:21:13.236 --> 01:21:15.102
Listen, I haven't
run it by her yet.

01:21:17.139 --> 01:21:18.405
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

01:21:19.942 --> 01:21:21.408
Absolutely.

01:21:22.578 --> 01:21:23.644
Very good.

01:21:25.514 --> 01:21:27.181
Good luck.

01:21:27.183 --> 01:21:28.549
Thanks. You too.

01:21:29.952 --> 01:21:31.619
I hope you win
that championship.

01:21:33.256 --> 01:21:34.889
Well, win or lose,

01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:36.991
it's been a great season.

01:21:36.993 --> 01:21:38.292
That's the key.

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:41.161
That's the key.

01:21:41.163 --> 01:21:42.630
No pressure.

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:46.400

-Why don't you tell your son
he made a great play?

Hey, Ed! I'm talking to you!

01:33:55.897 --> 01:33:57.897
Yeah, it was a good play.

01:33:57.899 --> 01:34:00.300
No, you're louder than that
when he screws up.
I don't think he heard you.

01:34:00.302 --> 01:34:01.968
Why don't you go sit down, Don?

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:04.304
I just wanna hear you say,
"Eric, you made a great play."

your own business? Yeah?

Please, let him catch this ball.

Please, let him catch this ball.

01:37:27.843 --> 01:37:29.075
Just once.

01:37:29.077 --> 01:37:30.243
Let him know what it feels like

01:37:30.245 --> 01:37:33.580
to have the ball
stay in his glove.

01:37:33.582 --> 01:37:37.250
Let him have this one memory
for the rest of his life.

01:37:37.252 --> 01:37:40.420
The night the ball fell into
his glove and stayed there.

01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:43.122
Check your stats, God.

01:37:43.124 --> 01:37:44.357
He's 12 years old.

01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:46.059
His first and last year
at Ripken League.

01:37:46.061 --> 01:37:48.094
No team for my boy next year.

This is a small request.

Last year, I asked you
to let my wife live,

01:37:53.001 --> 01:37:54.467
and yeah, that was a big one.

01:37:54.469 --> 01:37:57.270
And I'm sure you had
your reasons for what happened.

01:37:57.272 --> 01:37:59.639
Which I try to respect,
but I'll never understand.

a no-brainer.

struck out three times,

plus a ball got by him,
went all the way to the fence.

01:38:08.583 --> 01:38:10.884
Bad hop, not his fault.

01:38:10.886 --> 01:38:13.019
One more example of your
peculiar sense of humor,

01:38:13.021 --> 01:38:15.321
which has caused so much
hilarity through the ages.

01:38:16.892 --> 01:38:18.491
I need to feel hope.

01:38:18.493 --> 01:38:21.127
I wanna know there's
a purpose for all this.

01:38:21.129 --> 01:38:22.929
For the dropped fly balls

01:38:22.931 --> 01:38:25.965
and the endless hours
in the hospital waiting room.

01:38:25.967 --> 01:38:28.067
I don't need much.

01:42:37.485 --> 01:42:39.218
And then Frankie.

01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:40.386
What did they say?

01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:43.256
Didn't say anything.

01:42:45.193 --> 01:42:46.325
They were just there.

01:42:47.896 --> 01:42:49.762
They were a team.

01:42:49.764 --> 01:42:52.198
Ah, I love this team.

01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:53.533
Me too.

01:42:53.535 --> 01:42:55.168
[clears throat]

01:43:00.542 --> 01:43:01.574
Uh...

01:43:01.576 --> 01:43:03.476
Good game, Coach.

01:43:05.547 --> 01:43:06.779
Yeah, thanks.

01:43:11.719 --> 01:43:12.785
[indistinct]

01:43:14.622 --> 01:43:16.456
Hey, Mike!

01:43:16.457 --> 01:43:18.291
Would it be okay
if Frankie came to our house?

01:43:18.293 --> 01:43:20.459
I can grab a pizza,
and you can pick him up later.

01:43:20.461 --> 01:43:22.828
Yeah. Okay.

01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:24.797
Okay.

01:43:24.799 --> 01:43:26.265
Right! You guys ready?

01:43:27.335 --> 01:43:28.401
Okay.

01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:34.340
So, you around next week, Don?

01:43:35.610 --> 01:43:37.376
[Don]
Find a good place to park.

01:43:38.313 --> 01:43:39.378
Why?

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:41.214
I'll give you a call.

01:43:42.283 --> 01:43:43.382
Why?

01:43:44.419 --> 01:43:45.484
We get together.

01:43:45.486 --> 01:43:46.619
Why?

01:43:48.256 --> 01:43:49.989
I don't know.
Get a pizza or something.

01:43:49.991 --> 01:43:51.824
Do whatever people do
when they get together.

01:44:00.835 --> 01:44:02.335
I'm gonna say something here,
Mike.

01:44:03.538 --> 01:44:04.570
Okay.

01:44:07.976 --> 01:44:09.609
There is no reason

01:44:10.712 --> 01:44:12.311
for us to get together.

01:44:13.514 --> 01:44:14.680
See...

01:44:16.484 --> 01:44:18.517
I don't really consider you

01:44:18.519 --> 01:44:20.686
a friend,
and I think, if you're honest,

01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:23.589
you will find that

01:44:23.591 --> 01:44:25.491
you don't really consider me
a friend either.

01:44:25.493 --> 01:44:26.959
Of course I do. Why wouldn't I?

01:44:26.961 --> 01:44:29.028
Oh, please, Mike...

01:44:31.299 --> 01:44:32.732
I'm asking you to be honest.

01:44:33.668 --> 01:44:34.867
And that's a hard thing.

01:44:36.804 --> 01:44:38.304
So, I shouldn't call you?

01:44:40.508 --> 01:44:41.941
I thought we were getting
to be friends.

01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:47.647
I thought Tony was my friend.

01:44:53.321 --> 01:44:54.353
See, Mike...

01:44:55.890 --> 01:44:58.591
There comes a time for
every man who lives in his van,

01:45:00.428 --> 01:45:02.328
when he wants to know the truth.

01:45:03.931 --> 01:45:05.531
And the truth is...

01:45:06.467 --> 01:45:08.067
that you and I could never be...

01:45:09.804 --> 01:45:11.037
friends.

01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:14.507
I guess if I'm being honest...

01:45:17.478 --> 01:45:19.412
there were plenty of times
I dreaded coming here

01:45:19.414 --> 01:45:20.913
because I knew
it meant seeing you.

01:45:21.916 --> 01:45:23.082
I didn't know what to say.

01:45:23.084 --> 01:45:24.450
See?

01:45:26.654 --> 01:45:28.921
Isn't that better?

01:45:28.923 --> 01:45:31.023
Isn't that better than
some bullshit friendship

01:45:31.025 --> 01:45:34.026
where you gotta fake stuff like
caring about another person?

01:45:35.963 --> 01:45:37.530
I mean, it's a pretty big thing.

01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:41.634
We can tell each other
the truth.

01:45:41.636 --> 01:45:44.337
I never knew not being friends
could offer so much.

01:45:47.875 --> 01:45:49.041
Oh, damn.

01:45:50.445 --> 01:45:51.744
I...

01:45:51.746 --> 01:45:52.845
Oh.

01:45:52.847 --> 01:45:55.781
I forgot to give out the snacks.

01:45:55.783 --> 01:45:59.552
Snacks are an integral part
of the baseball experience.

01:46:01.022 --> 01:46:02.588
Well, I just figured,

01:46:02.590 --> 01:46:03.723
it's the last game.

01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:06.659
Guys should have the best.

01:46:07.662 --> 01:46:08.761
So, I, uh...

01:46:12.967 --> 01:46:14.533
I broke into the house
last night,

01:46:14.535 --> 01:46:15.968
and I cooked these up myself.

01:46:20.742 --> 01:46:23.008
Well, that's a positive step.

01:46:23.010 --> 01:46:24.777
You and Linda spending
some time together.

01:46:25.713 --> 01:46:26.779
Whether she knew it or not.

01:46:27.982 --> 01:46:29.081
[chuckles]

01:46:30.385 --> 01:46:31.650
Felt nice being back.

01:46:33.087 --> 01:46:34.153
I, uh...

01:46:36.758 --> 01:46:38.391
sat in all my favorite chairs.

01:46:38.393 --> 01:46:41.160
[laughing]

01:46:43.664 --> 01:46:44.830
Well...

01:46:44.832 --> 01:46:45.998
When I got to the van,

01:46:48.569 --> 01:46:50.002
I threw a hammer at the house.

01:46:53.474 --> 01:46:54.473
How come?

01:46:54.474 --> 01:46:55.473
Right there, handy,
in the front seat.

01:46:55.476 --> 01:46:56.742
[chuckles]

01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:01.814
Well, these things take time.

01:47:06.587 --> 01:47:07.653
Yeah.

01:47:10.558 --> 01:47:12.625
[crickets chirping]

01:47:29.444 --> 01:47:32.511
[rhythmic clapping
and percussion]

01:47:44.926 --> 01:47:48.861
¶ Take me out to the ball game ¶

01:47:48.863 --> 01:47:52.798
¶ Take me out to the crowd ¶

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.702
¶ Buy me some peanuts
and Cracker Jacks ¶

01:47:56.704 --> 01:48:00.005
¶ I don't care
if I ever get back ¶

01:48:00.007 --> 01:48:04.143
¶ For it's root, root, root
for the home team ¶

01:48:04.145 --> 01:48:07.847
¶ If they don't win,
it's a shame ¶

01:48:07.849 --> 01:48:11.851
¶ For it's one, two,
three strikes you're out ¶

01:48:11.853 --> 01:48:14.220
¶ At the old ¶

01:48:14.222 --> 01:48:16.121
¶ Ball ¶

01:48:16.123 --> 01:48:20.493
¶ Game ¶

01:48:20.495 --> 01:48:23.629
[rock music playing]

01:48:23.631 --> 01:48:27.766
¶ For it's root, root, root
for the home team ¶

01:48:27.768 --> 01:48:31.203
¶ If they don't win,
it's a shame ¶

01:48:31.205 --> 01:48:35.207
¶ For it's one, two,
three strikes, you're out ¶

01:48:35.209 --> 01:48:37.843
¶ At the old ¶

01:48:37.845 --> 01:48:39.678
¶ Ball ¶

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:43.649
¶ Game ¶

01:48:44.585 --> 01:48:45.918
¶ Let's play ball! ¶

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.520
[cheering]

01:48:55.730 --> 01:48:57.663
¶ I got the gold in my hand ¶

01:48:57.665 --> 01:48:59.932
¶ Second place will never do ¶

01:49:02.236 --> 01:49:04.837
¶ You got the silver
and the bronze, baby ¶

01:49:04.839 --> 01:49:06.939
¶ That's good enough for you ¶

01:49:09.176 --> 01:49:10.809
¶ Worked too hard, too long ¶

01:49:10.811 --> 01:49:13.712
¶ Came too far
just to turn back now ¶

01:49:15.583 --> 01:49:17.583
¶ I want the power
and the glory ¶

01:49:17.585 --> 01:49:19.051
¶ And it ain't no sin ¶

01:49:19.053 --> 01:49:20.753
¶ I'm a new sensation ¶

01:49:20.755 --> 01:49:23.222
¶ Came to win, win,
win, win, win ¶

01:49:28.696 --> 01:49:31.163
¶ The opposition's
in your way, baby ¶

01:49:31.165 --> 01:49:33.299
¶ But they are always there ¶

01:49:35.336 --> 01:49:37.770
¶ Keep your eyes
on the dream, sonny ¶

01:49:37.772 --> 01:49:40.573
¶ 'Cause none of them
don't care ¶

01:49:40.575 --> 01:49:42.041
¶ No ¶

01:49:42.043 --> 01:49:43.776
¶ Worked too hard, too long ¶

01:49:43.778 --> 01:49:46.645
¶ Came too far
just to turn back now ¶

01:49:48.282 --> 01:49:50.316
¶ You want the power
and the glory ¶

01:49:50.318 --> 01:49:51.850
¶ And it ain't no sin ¶

01:49:51.852 --> 01:49:53.652
¶ You're the new sensation ¶

01:49:53.654 --> 01:49:56.188
¶ Came to win, win,
win, win, win ¶

01:50:02.129 --> 01:50:03.195
¶ Uh ¶

01:50:06.334 --> 01:50:07.600
¶ Yeah ¶

01:50:12.907 --> 01:50:13.973
¶ Uh ¶

01:50:14.909 --> 01:50:16.609
¶ Worked too hard, too long ¶

01:50:16.611 --> 01:50:19.278
¶ Came too far
just to turn back now ¶

01:50:20.214 --> 01:50:22.648
¶ Uh, uh, uh ¶

01:50:22.650 --> 01:50:27.353
¶ Yeah ¶
