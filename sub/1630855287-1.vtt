WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:03.669
Joel mchale: We're back
with crime scene kitchen.

00:03.713 --> 00:04.545
Please let me in.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.213
(dramatic music)

00:06.298 --> 00:09.883
It's an all new season
with all new surprises

00:10.011 --> 00:12.344
To challenge the skills of all
new bakers.

00:12.471 --> 00:15.180
This time around, six teams
of classically trained bakers

00:15.266 --> 00:18.684
Go head to head with six
teams of self-taught ones.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.353
Speaker: What is happening this
season?

00:21.480 --> 00:22.271
Joel mchale: Who will win in the
end,

00:22.356 --> 00:25.607
The bakers with fancy degrees

00:25.735 --> 00:27.234
Or those with really
fast internet speeds?

00:27.319 --> 00:29.361
Fadi: Ah!

00:29.447 --> 00:30.529
Joel mchale: And if you're
frightened of change...

00:30.698 --> 00:31.739
Tarsha: I'm going to throw up.

00:31.824 --> 00:32.614
Joel mchale: Relax.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.700
I'm the same old joel.

00:34.827 --> 00:37.369
(cherry groans)
(joel groans)

00:37.455 --> 00:39.496
This is the crime scene kitchen,

00:39.582 --> 00:41.957
Where we combine
humanity's two loves,

00:42.043 --> 00:45.210
Baked goods and
criminal investigations.

00:45.296 --> 00:47.046
Speaker: Oh, my gosh, no!

00:47.131 --> 00:49.631
Steph: There's something
in the food processor.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.050
Speaker: Pears, oranges.

00:51.177 --> 00:52.801
Joel mchale: Using
only the clues

00:52.928 --> 00:54.136
Left behind in this kitchen,

00:54.263 --> 00:55.387
They must figure out
what was baked here.

00:55.473 --> 00:56.513
Tarsha: It's lime curd.

00:56.599 --> 00:58.307
Speaker: It could also be a
dacquoise.

00:58.434 --> 00:59.266
Speaker: It could
be a brioche donut.

00:59.351 --> 01:00.434
Joel mchale: Then recreate it

01:00.561 --> 01:02.144
In a nerve-wracking
race against the clock.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.312
Speaker: Bake, bake, bake.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.646
Joel mchale: 30 seconds!

01:04.732 --> 01:07.149
Speaker: Joel, you're
giving me a heart attack.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.567
Joel mchale: The right
decisions get them closer

01:08.694 --> 01:09.526
To winning $100,000.

01:10.279 --> 01:11.820
(cherry screams)
(contestants applaud)

01:11.947 --> 01:13.155
Joel mchale: Make
the wrong moves

01:13.282 --> 01:14.615
And they'll have to buy
their bus ticket home.

01:14.700 --> 01:15.908
Dayveon: Oh.

01:16.035 --> 01:16.825
Joel mchale: It's all
in the fine print.

01:16.911 --> 01:17.576
(contestant gasps)

01:17.745 --> 01:18.535
Yolanda gampp: Mine is raw.

01:18.662 --> 01:19.661
(cherry gasps)

01:19.789 --> 01:21.872
Speaker: I'm so frustrated.

01:21.990 --> 01:22.790
Joel mchale: More drama, more
pressure,

01:22.917 --> 01:24.291
More dramatic lighting effects.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.795
Although I was really
hoping this season,

01:27.922 --> 01:29.171
Fox would spring for
some fire cannons.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.675
Yeah!

01:34.720 --> 01:36.512
Get ready, america.

01:36.639 --> 01:37.679
This is crime scene kitchen.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.431
(dramatic music)

01:46.524 --> 01:46.855
Announcer: Ok, rolling.

01:46.941 --> 01:47.731
Three.

01:48.567 --> 01:49.191
Two.

01:49.693 --> 01:50.234
One.

01:51.070 --> 01:53.028
Send in our self-taught bakers.

02:07.169 --> 02:10.045
T: (singing) ♪ one, two,
three, four, five, six ♪

02:10.131 --> 02:11.839
This is bananas.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.215
We're finally here.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.175
I mean, like, we watched
the first season.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.135
It looked incredible.

02:17.096 --> 02:19.805
Fadi and I met, it was
just instant friendship,

02:19.932 --> 02:21.890
And we baked
together ever since.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.308
Fadi: I was an attorney
for almost 10 years.

02:23.427 --> 02:24.476
T: And I'm a circus performer.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.061
(dramatic music)

02:29.984 --> 02:30.607
Fadi: I love that.

02:30.693 --> 02:32.067
And he's very talented.

02:38.325 --> 02:41.702
Kathleen: We're more than just
two moms from the midwest.

02:41.787 --> 02:42.995
(laughs)

02:44.832 --> 02:46.957
Hannah: Feedback there.
Yeah, you like it? Good.

02:47.084 --> 02:47.666
Kathleen: Are you
having such a hard time

02:47.751 --> 02:49.543
Not laughing at us?

02:49.628 --> 02:50.669
Both of our husbands
are in the military,

02:50.796 --> 02:54.006
And we bought a bakery together.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.049
We want our kids to like think

02:56.168 --> 02:57.342
They got the most rad
moms in the world.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.264
Tarsha: This is my
daughter, kristy.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.099
Kristy: I learned to
bake from my mother,

03:04.185 --> 03:05.559
Who is self-taught,

03:05.644 --> 03:08.520
So I'm not sure everything
I have is correct.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.396
I'm just kidding. (laughs)

03:11.192 --> 03:12.983
Cherry: The kitchen
is my happy place.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.735
Steph: I entered my
first baking competition

03:14.820 --> 03:15.903
In second grade.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.154
That was for the moms,

03:17.281 --> 03:18.655
And I totally blew the
moms out of the water.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.032
Sorry, not sorry.

03:20.159 --> 03:21.325
Cherry: What gets me up
in the morning sometimes

03:21.452 --> 03:22.367
Is just like me wanting
to bake this pie.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.744
We're driven!

03:23.829 --> 03:25.287
We're passionate!

03:25.372 --> 03:25.495
We're here to win this!

03:26.665 --> 03:28.207
Joel mchale: Welcome
to crime scene kitchen,

03:28.292 --> 03:31.126
The baking competition that
rolls mystery and butter

03:31.212 --> 03:33.587
Into several thin layers
and then turns up the heat.

03:34.298 --> 03:37.123
This season, two different
groups go head to head.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.427
It's classically trained bakers
versus self-taught bakers.

03:41.513 --> 03:44.556
Next week, the fancy pants
classically trained bakers

03:44.642 --> 03:45.891
Will have a chance to show off.

03:45.976 --> 03:46.892
Halfway through the season,

03:46.977 --> 03:49.102
Teams from both
sides will merge.

03:50.356 --> 03:52.731
Tonight, we start with you
guys, the self-taught bakers.

03:53.984 --> 03:57.611
Behind me is the
crime scene kitchen.

03:57.696 --> 03:58.445
Michelle: Oh, my god.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.990
Joel mchale: An exquisite
dessert was created in there,

04:02.117 --> 04:04.743
But it's gone missing,
and it's up to you

04:04.828 --> 04:06.328
To sniff out the
clues left behind

04:06.455 --> 04:08.956
And recreate the mystery
dessert as best you can.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.542
The only ones who know the
identity of that mystery dessert

04:12.628 --> 04:13.710
Are our judges.

04:15.130 --> 04:18.382
She's an extraordinary cake
artist, baker, youtube star,

04:19.426 --> 04:21.343
And a little handsy
with the fondant.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.053
Yolanda gampp,
ladies and gentlemen.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.513
(contestants cheer)

04:24.598 --> 04:25.180
T: Yes, queen!

04:25.641 --> 04:26.723
Yolanda gampp: Hello.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.852
Dayveon: Seeing yolanda
means so much to me

04:30.938 --> 04:32.604
Because being self-taught,

04:32.731 --> 04:36.024
I've definitely modelled a
lot of my cakes after her.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.193
I've also learned to have
fun in the kitchen like her.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.028
Joel mchale: And he has

04:40.239 --> 04:41.905
A barely convincing
australian accent.

04:42.032 --> 04:45.409
Michelin star-awarded
chef, curtis stone.

04:45.494 --> 04:46.535
(contestants cheer)

04:48.622 --> 04:49.663
Curtis stone: What's up, guys?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.832
Tarsha: Curtis sone.

04:51.917 --> 04:52.624
Lord, help us.
Kristy: Yeah.

04:52.751 --> 04:53.667
Tarsha: Yes, honey!

04:57.214 --> 04:58.380
Kristy: Can we say
things like that?

04:59.049 --> 05:01.425
Tarsha: Yes.
(kirsty laughs)

05:02.428 --> 05:03.510
Joel mchale: There are two bakes
tonight.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.637
This season, it's more important
than ever

05:05.764 --> 05:08.515
To win the first baking
competition of the night,

05:08.684 --> 05:09.391
Which is our safety bake,

05:11.020 --> 05:12.644
Because whoever
wins the safety bake

05:12.730 --> 05:13.478
Skips the elimination bake,

05:14.398 --> 05:17.274
Where missing just one clue
could get you sent home.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.402
Each week, one team will be
eliminated.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.571
Don't worry, I'm not
in charge of the math.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.867
Until we end up with our best
team of baking detectives

05:26.994 --> 05:30.787
Who will take home $100,000.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.122
(contestants cheer)

05:33.667 --> 05:35.292
Kathleen: As military families,

05:35.336 --> 05:38.086
We are not financially
setting the world on fire.

05:38.213 --> 05:41.423
So winning the money would
mean the world to our families.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.301
Joel mchale: But
first, it was yolanda

05:44.386 --> 05:47.804
Who decided on the safety
bake mystery dessert.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.098
You'll have two minutes inside
the crime scene kitchen.

05:50.184 --> 05:53.268
All the clues will be
the same for every team,

05:53.395 --> 05:56.021
Just like in a real
criminal investigation.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.359
Dayveon and donovan, start your
search!

06:02.321 --> 06:03.904
Each team will take turns

06:04.031 --> 06:05.655
Going into the
crime scene kitchen.

06:06.784 --> 06:07.616
Steph: All right, let's go.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.116
Fadi: Time to investigate.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.705
Dayveon: Yo, it's some
heavy cream right here.

06:13.791 --> 06:14.915
Donovan: We got a mixing bowl.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.208
We got a whisk attachment.

06:16.293 --> 06:17.459
Dayveon: We have a dish here.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.586
We got a pie dish.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.463
When I see the wet pie dish,
I know it has to be a pie.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.882
It has to be a pie!

06:23.967 --> 06:25.050
Donovan: Got a zester
right here, man.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.009
Lemon zest.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.346
And it looks like we might have
some lime zest on here too.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.264
Dayveon: Definitely
something citrus.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.558
Kristy: That's lime.

06:33.685 --> 06:34.184
Tarsha: Yeah, that's green.

06:34.853 --> 06:35.685
Kristy: This is lime.

06:37.022 --> 06:37.562
Tarsha: It is lime.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.900
I see a bowl next to the zester,
and it has a custard in it,

06:41.985 --> 06:45.904
And it smells like lime to me.
Egg whites were not used.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.447
Custard.
It's lime curd.

06:47.908 --> 06:48.615
Kristy: Ok.

06:48.784 --> 06:49.908
Tarsha: Nothing in the freezer.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.077
Oh, there's a lime, pie.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.079
Kristy: Ok, key lime
pie, key lime pie.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.038
Tarsha: Key lime pie, key lime
pie. Kristy: Are you thinking
key lime pie?

06:55.165 --> 06:55.914
Tarsha: Yes.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.165
Fadi: There's a
compost over here

06:57.251 --> 06:58.208
With lemons and egg yolks.

06:58.252 --> 06:59.668
T: Lemons and egg yolks?

06:59.795 --> 07:00.794
So like a lemon curd?

07:00.921 --> 07:01.711
Fadi: Yeah, I think
it's a lemon curd.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.004
T: This is very lemony.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.005
Fadi: Oh.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.298
T: Very lemony, and
some eggs are used.

07:05.426 --> 07:08.260
Fadi: Ok.
T: We have the lemon curd.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.970
Fadi: Oh, yeah, that smells
amazing. Super lemony.

07:10.681 --> 07:13.098
T: The mixer and whisk in the
dishwasher.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.101
Fadi: I think we're making
like a lemon meringue pie.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.228
T: That has to equal a lemon
meringue pie.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.856
The big question is what is the
crust?

07:22.025 --> 07:22.941
Fadi: There's a food
processor with crumbs in it.

07:23.026 --> 07:23.650
T: This could be...

07:23.861 --> 07:24.693
T and fadi: Graham cracker.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.362
Michelle: There's
graham crackers.

07:27.448 --> 07:28.363
Torre: Is it open?

07:28.449 --> 07:29.656
Michelle: But they
don't look open.

07:30.367 --> 07:30.907
Kathleen: Oh, this is like for a
crust.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.577
Donovan: The processor's used

07:33.662 --> 07:34.411
And we got some crumbs inside.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.205
Steph: There's something
in the food processor.

07:37.291 --> 07:40.041
I see inside the food processor
that there are crumbs.

07:41.003 --> 07:42.335
Looks like a cracker crumb.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.838
Looks like saltines?

07:44.923 --> 07:46.006
I know it's a saltine cracker,

07:46.300 --> 07:48.216
But in my heart, I'm just
like, that makes no sense.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.301
Smell this.

07:49.845 --> 07:50.552
It smells like saltines.

07:51.054 --> 07:51.636
Cherry: Oh, yeah.

07:51.763 --> 07:52.971
(dramatic music)

07:53.056 --> 07:53.805
(buzzer sounds)

07:53.891 --> 07:55.307
Fadi: 10 seconds.

07:55.392 --> 07:55.807
T: 10 seconds, oh, god, ok, ok.

07:55.934 --> 07:56.349
Fadi: Oh, god.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.142
Tarsha: Hurry up.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.226
We got to hurry up.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.144
Michelle: Spices
don't look used.

07:59.855 --> 08:00.604
This doesn't look used.

08:00.731 --> 08:01.688
It's some sort of a lemon pie.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.940
Dayveon: What kind
of crust is this?

08:04.026 --> 08:04.858
Tarsha: Oh, graham
cracker crust.

08:04.985 --> 08:05.901
There's graham crackers here.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.360
Kathleen: Ok, what
else, what else?

08:09.198 --> 08:10.614
Joel mchale: That is time!

08:10.741 --> 08:11.448
Go to your kitchens!

08:12.284 --> 08:12.657
Tarsha: Ok.
Dayveon: We got this.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.702
Joel mchale: Bakers,
you'll now have two hours

08:15.787 --> 08:18.288
To recreate the mystery dessert.

08:18.415 --> 08:21.791
Whoever gets closest will be
safe and automatically move on

08:21.919 --> 08:23.251
To the next stage
of the competition,

08:23.378 --> 08:24.294
Avoiding the elimination
bake altogether.

08:26.798 --> 08:27.422
Kathleen: Ok, ok.

08:27.508 --> 08:28.089
Fadi: Ok.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.509
So what did you see?

08:30.594 --> 08:31.676
What do you think we're making?

08:31.762 --> 08:32.469
T: I mean, there's
definitely a lemon curd.

08:33.555 --> 08:35.597
If we win safety, it
will be a huge relief

08:35.682 --> 08:38.975
Just to not have to worry
about the first elimination.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.229
T: No, we're not going anywhere.

08:42.314 --> 08:42.854
Fadi: Mm-mm.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.022
T: That's not up for discussion.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.192
Fadi: In the food processor,
it looked like it was sandy,

08:47.694 --> 08:48.485
Which I'm like,

08:48.570 --> 08:49.736
What?

08:51.073 --> 08:52.989
T: Do you think it's a graham
cracker crust lemon meringue
pie?

08:53.075 --> 08:53.823
Fadi: I don't know.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.700
T: Because there
was a lemon curd,

08:55.869 --> 08:58.203
Some type of crumbled
base, a pie plate,

08:58.288 --> 09:00.330
We go to lemon meringue pie

09:00.415 --> 09:02.791
And we're figuring
graham cracker crust.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.460
We might be wrong, but
it's going to be delicious.

09:05.546 --> 09:06.127
Fadi: Yeah.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.757
Hannah: I've never felt
so nervous in my life,

09:10.842 --> 09:11.800
So it's fine.

09:11.927 --> 09:12.592
Kathleen: Maybe we
will do better...

09:12.719 --> 09:13.885
Hannah: Ok.

09:14.096 --> 09:14.636
Kathleen: If we pretend like
we're at home right now.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.513
Mom, mom.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.973
Get me a drink.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.015
We're like, "don't,
get out of here."

09:19.685 --> 09:20.475
Joel mchale: Hannah...

09:20.561 --> 09:21.768
Kathleen: Ah!

09:21.895 --> 09:22.394
Joel mchale: And kathleen.

09:22.521 --> 09:23.228
Hannah: Come on.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.980
We're panicking over here!

09:28.318 --> 09:29.484
Kathleen: Yup.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.319
I am like really struggling
to like get oxygen.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.737
So I'm going to be honest.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.907
I'm like a little bit fan
girl, star struck right now.

09:36.034 --> 09:36.866
Joel mchale: See.
Kathleen: Just a little bit.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.368
I'm a big fan of joel mchale.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.120
I like fan girl.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.789
I like used to watch the
soup every night before bed.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.165
I like can't believe
he's standing next to me.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.002
First time in my life, I
didn't have a whole lot to say.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.878
Joel mchale: So
what are you making?

09:48.964 --> 09:49.754
Kathleen: A lemon chiffon pie.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.381
Joel mchale: Right.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.717
Why in the world did you think
it was a lemon chiffon pie?

09:53.802 --> 09:56.261
Hannah: Because we saw the lemon
juice...

09:56.346 --> 09:57.345
Kathleen: Egg whites.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.096
Hannah: The egg
whites in the fridge.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.389
Joel mchale: Ok.

09:59.683 --> 10:00.765
Hannah: And we're going to
put the whipped cream on top.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.726
There was the zester,
the lemons in the trash.

10:02.811 --> 10:07.230
We are making a lemon chiffon
pie with a flaky pie crust

10:07.357 --> 10:09.149
Topped with whipped
cream and lemon garnish.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.318
Kathleen: A chiffon
is like a cream pie.

10:11.445 --> 10:15.196
It has the meringue
folded into the curd.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.699
Oh, I hope lemon
chiffon pie is right.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.117
Joel mchale: Ok, guys.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.076
It's going to be fine.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.119
Kathleen: Ok, your
hair looks awesome.

10:21.163 --> 10:21.453
Joel mchale: Thank you.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.750
Steph: They had the
graham crackers out,

10:26.835 --> 10:28.293
But those food processor chunks
like did not look brown enough

10:28.462 --> 10:30.420
To be graham cracker crumbs.
Cherry: No, not at all.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.213
Steph: I was looking
in the food processor.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.299
I saw a little crumb of what
looked like a saltine cracker.

10:34.384 --> 10:38.428
But I've never heard of
anybody using a saltine crust

10:38.555 --> 10:40.305
For like a sweet pie. I don't
know. It sounds kind of funky to
me.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.515
Cherry: I believe I've seen
the recipe before for this

10:42.559 --> 10:45.185
And it was called a boardwalk
saltine pie.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.771
I had a phase where I
literally went to the library

10:47.856 --> 10:50.315
And took out all of these
cookbooks that I couldn't
afford.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.192
And then I would take it to
work and use a big copier

10:52.319 --> 10:54.194
And just copy recipes. (laughs)

10:56.114 --> 10:57.364
So we're making a boardwalk pie

10:57.449 --> 10:58.907
Which has a saltine
cracker crust,

10:59.034 --> 11:01.284
Lemon curd with whipped cream,

11:01.411 --> 11:02.160
Garnished with
lemon and lime zest.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.828
Steph: It's so out there.

11:04.539 --> 11:07.374
A little sugar to balance the
sweet. Cherry: This is
traumatizing.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.004
Tarsha: I'm thinking
key lime pie.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.840
We are making a key lime pie
topped with whipped cream

11:15.967 --> 11:18.677
Because we saw a zester on the
counter with lime zest on it,

11:19.638 --> 11:20.762
And it had a smell of lime.

11:22.683 --> 11:23.515
Where are the graham crackers?

11:25.143 --> 11:27.018
There were graham
crackers on the counter,

11:27.104 --> 11:29.312
So I'm sure that it's
a graham cracker crust.

11:29.398 --> 11:30.605
It needs to be a
fine powder, hon.

11:30.732 --> 11:31.189
Kristy: Really?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.442
Tarsha: Kristy, why you got
to question me on everything?

11:34.528 --> 11:35.652
(suspenseful music)

11:36.613 --> 11:38.446
Joel mchale: One hour
left in the bake.

11:38.699 --> 11:39.906
One hour.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.575
You should already be
sweating into your batter.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.160
Donovan: Man, I got my workout
in for today, my good brother.

11:45.664 --> 11:46.746
Joel mchale: Dayveon, donovan.

11:46.832 --> 11:47.747
Dayveon: Hey.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.207
Donovan: Yo, what's
going on, man?

11:49.292 --> 11:49.791
Dayveon: My favorite guy.

11:49.918 --> 11:50.750
(donovan chuckles)

11:50.836 --> 11:51.251
Joel mchale: Oh,
you already won.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.502
What are you making?

11:52.629 --> 11:54.921
Dayveon: A citrus curd pie.

11:55.006 --> 11:55.755
And it's going to
be really good.

11:56.425 --> 11:59.676
What don and I are making
is a flaky buttery pie crust

11:59.803 --> 12:04.848
Filled with lemon and lime
curd, topped with whipped cream.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.391
Joel mchale: Do you guys
cook a lot together?

12:06.435 --> 12:07.350
Dayveon: We definitely
aren't strangers

12:07.427 --> 12:09.227
Together in the kitchen at all.

12:09.479 --> 12:10.311
Donovan: We're step brothers.
Dayveon: We're step brothers.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.646
Joel mchale: Oh, all right.

12:11.857 --> 12:14.190
Where are you guys from?
Dayveon: Inglewood, california.

12:14.276 --> 12:17.026
Donovan: Inglewood, california.
Inglewood is a family-oriented
city.

12:17.112 --> 12:19.988
And at the same time, inglewood
is still the inner city.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.615
There's gangs where there's
violence and things like that.

12:22.701 --> 12:23.867
For us to be sitting here

12:24.035 --> 12:25.493
And we're about to have
a piping bag in our hand,

12:25.579 --> 12:26.327
(dayveon laughs)

12:26.413 --> 12:28.329
Is like a tremendous thing.

12:28.999 --> 12:29.956
Dayveon: We got this.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.624
Hundred thousand.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.126
Donovan: You got to
say it loud and proud.

12:34.796 --> 12:35.503
Yolanda gampp: Winning
the safety bake

12:35.589 --> 12:36.796
Is really important

12:36.965 --> 12:40.133
Because the winner sits
out of the elimination bake

12:40.260 --> 12:41.718
And immediately advances

12:41.887 --> 12:43.261
To the next stage
of this competition.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.015
And we're looking to see who
gets closest to the mystery
dessert.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.685
You really have to
scrutinize the tiniest of clues

12:50.812 --> 12:51.978
If you want to be the winner.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.274
Michelle: I think that if
it was not a pie crust,

12:56.359 --> 12:57.901
It was a graham cracker crust.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.028
Torre: Graham and lime is
not super super like...

13:00.155 --> 13:01.029
Michelle: I know, graham
doesn't do it for me.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.573
Torre: Today, we're making
a traditional pie crust

13:03.658 --> 13:04.824
With a lemon chiffon filling,

13:04.910 --> 13:06.868
And we're going to top
that with lemon zest.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.787
Michelle: I feel very confident

13:08.914 --> 13:10.413
Even though we're both
technically self-taught pastry
chefs.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.665
Torre and I met

13:12.709 --> 13:14.209
While we were working
together in a restaurant.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.835
Torre: The fact that we
now own our own bakery

13:15.962 --> 13:16.544
I think is a pretty
important thing.

13:17.881 --> 13:20.006
Michelle: First day I met him, I
knew I was going to marry him...

13:20.175 --> 13:21.090
Torre: The feelings
weren't mutual at the time.

13:22.928 --> 13:23.718
Michelle: I will
slap you on camera.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.845
(torre laughs)

13:25.972 --> 13:28.807
Ok, my curd is definitely
starting to get very thick. You
good?

13:28.892 --> 13:30.391
Torre: Yes, ma'am.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.145
Joel mchale: 30 minutes left!

13:34.231 --> 13:37.106
Tarsha: You want to stir
while I try to get that right?

13:38.193 --> 13:38.983
Kristy: If it makes
you feel better.

13:39.069 --> 13:39.567
Tarsha: It will.

13:39.778 --> 13:40.485
Just keep stirring it.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.486
Don't let it burn on the bottom.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.364
When you're cooking custard on a
stovetop,

13:44.533 --> 13:47.325
You have to let the
custard do its thing.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.077
You can't rush it.

13:49.704 --> 13:50.328
Did you turn it up?

13:51.206 --> 13:51.830
Kristy: I think my elbow
touched it by accident.

13:51.957 --> 13:52.664
Tarsha: Uh-huh.

13:52.833 --> 13:53.540
There's brown pieces in here.

13:53.625 --> 13:54.874
Kristy: I did not burn it.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.376
Tarsha: You did. Look at that.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.711
Kristy: That didn't happen
while I was stirring it.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.088
Tarsha: You turned it up.

14:00.257 --> 14:00.713
It's burnt.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.757
We got to start over.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.851
Lord, please bless this pie.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.686
You were just supposed
to stir the custard.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.145
I didn't turn it up.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.897
It didn't do it by itself.

14:18.066 --> 14:21.693
Kristy: When I was working under
my mom, I got fired every other
day.

14:23.113 --> 14:24.445
Tarsha: Next time,
don't touch it.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.741
Joel mchale: Yolanda, you
set the first challenge.

14:28.827 --> 14:29.909
How are the teams doing?

14:29.995 --> 14:31.661
Yolanda gampp: I'm
really impressed

14:31.788 --> 14:33.288
With how they're
working together.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.248
All six teams have
made citrus pies.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.916
So we'll be looking at who
got the most details right

14:37.002 --> 14:39.210
And who got closest to
the mystery dessert.

14:40.505 --> 14:41.504
Curtis stone: In this season,

14:41.590 --> 14:43.298
The first bake is
all about safety.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.550
So if they've guessed right
and they've executed nicely,

14:45.635 --> 14:47.719
The best team will skip
the elimination bake

14:47.804 --> 14:50.388
And move straight on to the
next stage of the competition.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.976
Yolanda gampp: Tarsha and
kristy burnt their curd,

14:55.061 --> 14:56.686
And now I'm really
worried about their time.

14:58.189 --> 14:58.980
Curtis stone: But
they're the only team

14:59.065 --> 15:00.982
Making a lime pie.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.234
If they're the ones that
have guessed it correctly

15:03.320 --> 15:04.903
And key lime pie
is the actual pie,

15:05.030 --> 15:06.404
They're in a really good spot.

15:07.282 --> 15:08.573
Yolanda gampp: With the crust,

15:08.658 --> 15:11.075
Some of the bakers are
making a traditional pastry,

15:11.161 --> 15:14.829
Like hannah and kathleen,
dayveon and donovan,

15:14.915 --> 15:16.831
And michelle and torre.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.125
But some of the bakers are
making a graham cracker crust,

15:19.294 --> 15:21.836
Like fadi and t, and tarsha and
kristy.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.047
Cherry: We're absolutely
putting it in the freezer.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.548
Steph: Yeah, just to
give us some time to sit.

15:25.675 --> 15:28.384
Yolanda gampp: And cherry
and steph are the only ones

15:28.470 --> 15:30.386
Making a crust out of saltine
crackers.

15:30.472 --> 15:31.304
Steph: Nice, beautiful.

15:31.348 --> 15:34.140
Love your crust work, as always.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.516
Curtis stone: They're
making a boardwalk pie,

15:35.685 --> 15:37.727
Which is actually better known
as an atlantic beach pie.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.939
Yolanda gampp: The danger of
them picking a saltine crust

15:41.024 --> 15:42.190
Is they're the only ones.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.192
So if they're wrong,
they won't win safety.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.235
T: I'm a little bit confused.

15:46.988 --> 15:47.779
I'm a little bit anxious.

15:47.864 --> 15:48.488
Fadi: Meringue is done.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.530
Meringue is piped.

15:49.658 --> 15:50.198
Meringue is torched.

15:50.700 --> 15:51.532
Joel mchale: One
minute remaining!

15:51.660 --> 15:52.325
One minute!

15:54.496 --> 15:56.496
Fadi: Ah!

15:56.623 --> 15:57.413
Steph: Wah!

15:57.499 --> 15:57.872
Donovan: We got it, we got it.

15:57.958 --> 15:58.331
We're ok.

15:58.875 --> 15:59.582
Joel mchale: Here we go.

15:59.659 --> 16:00.249
Three.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.501
Two.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.335
One.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.503
And that is time.

16:03.588 --> 16:04.712
Time's up.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.675
Time to be judged.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.425
(steph laughs)

16:12.681 --> 16:13.763
Tarsha and kristy.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.682
Tarsha: If we win the safety,

16:15.767 --> 16:17.600
Then we get to sit
out the next round.

16:17.686 --> 16:20.603
We don't have to stress
like we're stressing now.

16:20.730 --> 16:21.396
(kirsty laughs)

16:21.523 --> 16:22.063
Fadi: Key lime.

16:22.315 --> 16:22.981
They made a key lime pie.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.478
Tarsha: Hi.
Yolanda gampp: Hello.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.906
Joel mchale: Look at that.
Yolanda gampp: What have you
made us?

16:31.992 --> 16:33.908
Tarsha: Key lime pie with
a graham cracker crust

16:33.952 --> 16:35.034
And whipped cream on top.

16:37.539 --> 16:38.788
Curtis stone: What was it
that led you to believe

16:38.832 --> 16:41.082
You needed to make
a key lime pie?

16:41.209 --> 16:42.417
Tarsha: On the zester,
we thought we saw lime.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.713
Curtis stone: I think it's
a beautiful presentation.

16:46.798 --> 16:47.714
Yolanda gampp:
Why did you choose

16:47.799 --> 16:49.424
To make a graham cracker crust?

16:49.551 --> 16:50.591
Tarsha: We saw graham
crackers on the counter.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.301
Kristy: We saw graham crackers.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.013
(suspenseful music)

17:00.478 --> 17:01.769
Curtis stone: It's
a beautiful color,

17:01.938 --> 17:04.147
But what's nicer than the
color is the way it tastes.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.567
Yolanda gampp: The
curd is divine.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.403
I just wish there was a
nice solid crust underneath.

17:12.032 --> 17:15.241
Curtis stone: If it is
tyou could be safe.,

17:15.326 --> 17:15.867
Joel mchale: Curtis,
could you keep it down?

17:15.994 --> 17:16.034
I'm eating.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.996
Torre and michelle, please
bring us your dessert.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.331
Cherry: Oh.

17:23.710 --> 17:24.834
Oh, that's a beautiful crust.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.628
Michelle: We have made
a lemon chiffon pie.

17:27.756 --> 17:28.880
Kristy: Lemon.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.507
Curtis stone: It has the
appearance of a homemade pie.

17:32.052 --> 17:32.842
You guys are self-taught bakers

17:32.969 --> 17:34.052
So that's what's to be expected.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.097
Yolanda gampp: And what clues
led you to make this pie?

17:39.309 --> 17:40.266
Michelle: We saw what we
thought was a lemon curd

17:40.351 --> 17:42.351
That was made in the kitchen.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.687
We saw the lemon
zest on the zester.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.272
Curtis stone: Torre, how
did you come to this crust?

17:46.357 --> 17:49.859
Torre: We saw in
the food processor

17:49.944 --> 17:51.194
Some sort of pastry
crust in there.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.369
Yolanda gampp: The filling
is light, airy, lemony.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.038
It's delightful.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.456
Curtis stone: I maybe want
just a little more complexity,

18:03.541 --> 18:06.751
But it's very, very
pleasurable to eat.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.795
Torre: Let's go.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.254
Curtis stone: So let's hope
it is a lemon chiffon pie.

18:10.507 --> 18:13.007
Then you could have a very good
chance of winning safety.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.468
Joel mchale:
Dayveon and donovan.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.012
Donovan: This is intense.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.139
I'm nervous as ever
going into this tasting.

18:20.683 --> 18:21.808
(cherry gasps)

18:21.893 --> 18:23.059
Kristy: They put lemon
and lime in theirs.

18:24.687 --> 18:25.436
Joel mchale: Look at this.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.146
Dayveon: A citrus curd pie.

18:27.732 --> 18:28.773
Joel mchale: Yep.

18:28.900 --> 18:29.482
Yolanda gampp:
Why did you choose

18:29.651 --> 18:30.483
To call it a citrus pie?

18:31.611 --> 18:32.902
Donovan: The zester had lemon.

18:33.113 --> 18:33.986
Then we flipped it over, we saw
that it had lime underneath.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.196
So we wanted to make sure

18:35.281 --> 18:37.240
That we incorporated
both into the dish.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.202
Hannah: Lime and lemon.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.662
Curtis stone: So do you think
that they made a pie crust

18:42.747 --> 18:44.038
In that food processor?

18:44.791 --> 18:45.748
Donovan: I think so.

18:45.834 --> 18:46.332
Dayveon: Yes.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.626
We did see graham crackers,

18:48.753 --> 18:51.254
But it did not look like the
graham crackers were crushed.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.631
Curtis stone: It
cuts quite nicely.

18:56.344 --> 18:57.385
Your crust is quite lovely.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.138
Yolanda gampp: I do think your
filling

19:00.265 --> 19:01.347
Could have been a bit thicker.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.390
Dayveon: Got it.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.307
Curtis stone: This
is a good pie,

19:04.060 --> 19:05.101
But it's not a great pie.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.271
But what matters most,
is it the right pie?

19:11.776 --> 19:13.693
Joel mchale: Fadi and t!

19:14.904 --> 19:16.904
T: I want to win safety so bad.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.573
To have that moment
to just breathe

19:18.616 --> 19:20.825
And not have to be in
the elimination bake.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.368
Kristy: Oh, how pretty.

19:23.705 --> 19:24.871
Joel mchale: What is this?

19:24.998 --> 19:26.164
T: We have made for you

19:26.291 --> 19:28.166
A graham cracker crust lemon
meringue pie.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.333
Fadi: We went with a
graham cracker crust

19:29.460 --> 19:32.420
Because we saw some
sort of crumbly bits

19:32.505 --> 19:33.462
In a food processor.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.466
Curtis stone: The
crust is very firm.

19:37.552 --> 19:38.384
Joel mchale: Do you
want a jackhammer?

19:38.469 --> 19:38.926
(fadi laughs)

19:39.929 --> 19:41.387
Curtis stone: I'm trying
for you here, guys,

19:41.472 --> 19:42.346
But you're not
making my job easy.

19:42.432 --> 19:42.972
Fadi: I'm sorry.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.351
Curtis stone: I mean,
you've bent my cake fork.

19:55.820 --> 19:56.694
That is a good curd.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.072
It is one of the best
curds I've ever eaten.

20:00.200 --> 20:00.698
Fadi: Oh, my god.
Curtis stone: It really is.

20:00.825 --> 20:01.574
Fadi: Yes!

20:01.826 --> 20:03.409
T: Just don't know
if it's right.

20:04.495 --> 20:07.038
Joel mchale: Hannah
and kathleen!

20:07.123 --> 20:08.080
Contestants: Ooh.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.666
Joel mchale: Look at that.

20:10.835 --> 20:15.379
Kathleen: We have made a
lemon chiffon pie with...

20:15.465 --> 20:17.298
Hannah: A flaky pie crust
and whipped cream topping.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.467
Steph: Oh my gosh.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.470
Could it have been a
butter and flour crust

20:22.597 --> 20:23.763
That we mistook for saltine?

20:23.848 --> 20:24.472
Judges: Whoa.

20:24.599 --> 20:25.640
Hannah: Ok, ok.

20:25.767 --> 20:26.766
Yolanda gampp: Yes.

20:26.893 --> 20:27.516
Hannah: Yeah!

20:33.900 --> 20:34.982
Curtis stone: It's
a very light pie,

20:35.109 --> 20:37.026
And the crispness of
the crust is very good.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.946
Yolanda gampp: It has
a lovely tart flavor.

20:40.031 --> 20:42.156
The crust is nice and crunchy.

20:42.283 --> 20:46.035
But part of me wants just a
thicker, more luscious filling.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.162
Joel mchale: Hannah
and kathleen,

20:48.289 --> 20:49.372
If you guessed right,
you could be the ones

20:49.499 --> 20:52.083
Who win this all
important safety bake.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.461
Cherry and steph!

20:56.297 --> 20:57.922
Michelle: What is that?

20:58.049 --> 20:59.882
Is that graham crackers or a pie
crust?

21:01.177 --> 21:03.261
Joel mchale: Cherry and
steph, what did you make?

21:04.722 --> 21:06.013
Cherry: We made a boardwalk pie,

21:06.140 --> 21:07.807
And we used lemon zest
and lime for garnish.

21:07.976 --> 21:10.268
Steph: The crust is actually
made out of saltine crackers.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.560
Fadi: Excuse me.

21:11.646 --> 21:13.104
Donovan: Saltine crackers.

21:13.147 --> 21:15.648
Steph: I looked in
the food processor,

21:15.692 --> 21:17.858
And when I sniffed it,
it smelled more savoury.

21:17.986 --> 21:20.945
And I saw a little
piece of a cracker

21:21.072 --> 21:23.322
With some ridges on it, which
looked like a saltine cracker.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.240
Tarsha: Where the heck
did a saltine cracker,

21:24.367 --> 21:26.742
Did you see saltine crackers?

21:27.161 --> 21:28.035
Curtis stone: Will
this crust hold up?

21:28.162 --> 21:29.704
(suspenseful music)

21:41.968 --> 21:43.050
Guys, did you put this
pie in the freezer?

21:43.094 --> 21:44.760
Cherry: Yes.

21:45.763 --> 21:48.222
Curtis stone: The cream
is frozen in a big lump.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.517
Yolanda gampp: The
cream's so cold

21:51.602 --> 21:53.227
That it really
distracts your palate.

21:53.396 --> 21:54.812
Curtis stone: You know,
it's very hard to enjoy

21:54.897 --> 21:55.980
That lovely luscious texture.

21:57.191 --> 21:59.442
The interesting thing
about this competition

21:59.527 --> 22:01.319
Is it isn't just about
your baking skills.

22:01.404 --> 22:02.361
It's also about detective work.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.114
So if you've baked
the right kind of pie,

22:05.199 --> 22:08.034
Then if you're the only
one that's done it,

22:08.161 --> 22:09.744
You're probably safe for
the elimination challenge.

22:11.831 --> 22:12.705
Cherry: We thought
things were going to go

22:12.790 --> 22:14.415
A lot smoother than they did.

22:14.834 --> 22:15.791
Steph: I'm just hoping

22:15.918 --> 22:17.001
We've just presented the right
dessert.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.253
Joel mchale: The
tasting is done.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.716
Let's reveal the crime
scene kitchen dessert.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.134
(suspenseful music)

22:36.064 --> 22:36.854
Welcome back to
crime scene kitchen.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.522
Here's where things stand.

22:39.567 --> 22:42.109
There are six different
takes on the citrus pie,

22:42.195 --> 22:44.987
Each with different
fillings, different crusts,

22:45.114 --> 22:46.697
And handled with
different fingers.

22:46.783 --> 22:47.907
Whoever does best

22:48.034 --> 22:50.618
Coming closest to the
mystery dessert is safe

22:50.703 --> 22:53.287
And automatically advances
in the competition.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.998
And that dessert
is hidden inside

22:56.084 --> 22:58.250
This display of smoke and
lights we like to call

22:58.294 --> 23:00.127
The confectionator 3000.

23:02.632 --> 23:04.632
Let's reveal the crime
scene kitchen dessert.

23:06.177 --> 23:09.053
(dramatic music)

23:11.265 --> 23:12.973
Kathleen: I really hope
it's a lemon chiffon pie.

23:15.353 --> 23:16.477
Kristy: Bring the smoke on.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.686
I'm ready to see.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.939
Tarsha: If it's not a
key lime, just change it.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.690
Kristy: Just put my
pie in there. (laughs)

23:21.776 --> 23:23.025
Tarsha: Just put
our pie in there.

23:24.112 --> 23:24.735
Fadi: What is it?

23:28.533 --> 23:30.533
Joel mchale: It is an
atlantic beach pie.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.701
(cherry squeals)

23:35.998 --> 23:40.376
It has a tangy lemon and lime
filling with a saltine crust,

23:40.503 --> 23:44.255
Topped with whipped cream,
lemon and lime zest.

23:44.424 --> 23:45.881
Steph: It's a saltine crust.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.425
Cherry: We're the only people
that used saltines in their
crust.

23:48.386 --> 23:49.510
Tarsha: I'm only human.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.971
I'm a baker, not a detective,
apparently.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.141
Joel mchale: Yolanda, can you
explain

23:55.309 --> 23:56.392
How our contestants were
supposed to figure that one out.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.186
Yolanda gampp: The glass
dish in the drying rack

23:59.313 --> 24:01.021
Suggested a pie was made.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.565
Fadi: Check.

24:02.692 --> 24:04.358
Yolanda gampp: The squeezed
lemon in the compost

24:04.444 --> 24:08.279
And the zester with
both lemon and lime zest

24:08.364 --> 24:11.282
Suggested it was a mixed citrus
filling.

24:11.325 --> 24:14.160
The bowl of filling smelled
of both lemon and lime.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.955
While graham crackers
were present,

24:18.040 --> 24:19.165
There's no evidence
they were used.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.252
On closer inspection
of the food processor,

24:25.089 --> 24:26.714
You should have noticed the
remains of saltine crackers.

24:27.008 --> 24:29.258
Fadi: I just assumed
graham crackers

24:29.343 --> 24:31.927
'cause that's what made sense
in my head and I'm like...

24:32.013 --> 24:33.679
T: I definitely
didn't see saltines.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.765
Yolanda gampp: The
saltines, lemon, lime,

24:36.851 --> 24:40.519
And used whipping cream
should have led you

24:40.605 --> 24:43.981
To the atlantic beach pie,
otherwise known as boardwalk
pie.

24:44.192 --> 24:46.192
(cherry squeals)

24:47.195 --> 24:49.069
The winners of the
safety bake are

24:52.116 --> 24:54.283
Cherry and steph.

24:54.368 --> 24:57.161
(dramatic music)
(contestants applaud)

24:59.373 --> 25:00.331
Congratulations.

25:00.416 --> 25:01.457
Cherry: Thank you.
Steph: Thank you.

25:01.542 --> 25:02.458
Yolanda gampp: You're safe.

25:03.044 --> 25:05.669
Joel mchale: You automatically
advance in the competition

25:06.297 --> 25:09.340
And you do not have to compete
in the elimination bake.

25:09.425 --> 25:10.549
You could now head off safely.

25:11.761 --> 25:13.427
Steph: So relieved that we
don't have to go through

25:13.554 --> 25:14.553
The elimination challenge.

25:14.639 --> 25:15.971
I don't think my
heart could handle it.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.307
Joel mchale: For
the rest of you,

25:18.392 --> 25:20.226
It is time for the
elimination bake

25:21.103 --> 25:23.562
Where your next level skills
will be put to the test.

25:24.440 --> 25:28.192
The worst team in the bake
will be eliminated tonight.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.153
This mystery dessert
was decided by curtis.

25:32.073 --> 25:36.825
Bakers, the crime scene
kitchen is now open.

25:36.911 --> 25:38.869
Two minutes on the
oversized clock, please.

25:39.247 --> 25:42.164
Hannah and kathleen, start your
search.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.750
Each team will take turns

25:44.877 --> 25:46.627
Going into the
crime scene kitchen.

25:46.754 --> 25:47.878
Kathleen: Come on, hannah.

25:48.005 --> 25:48.170
Hannah: Oh, here we go.
Kathleen: We can do it.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.422
Joel mchale: One team at a time,

25:50.550 --> 25:51.340
You'll each have two minutes
to examine the same clues.

25:52.093 --> 25:53.676
Hannah: Ok, we got a cake pan.

25:53.803 --> 25:54.760
Kathleen: It smells like...

25:54.845 --> 25:55.302
Hannah: Batter.

25:55.388 --> 25:56.554
Kathleen: Yeah.

25:56.681 --> 26:00.724
In the sink is a cake pan
that has batter in it.

26:01.644 --> 26:02.393
Hannah: And there's only one.

26:02.478 --> 26:03.686
Kathleen: Right.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.187
Hannah: So it is not any
kind of large layered cake.

26:07.692 --> 26:08.482
Fadi: Maraschino cherries.

26:08.568 --> 26:09.692
T: Melted butter and milk.

26:09.777 --> 26:10.442
Pineapples.

26:11.279 --> 26:13.028
I mean, that's pretty used.

26:13.114 --> 26:14.113
Fadi: What kind of cake
would use pineapples?

26:15.366 --> 26:18.534
So I see the pineapple
rings and the juice,

26:18.619 --> 26:19.910
And it's clearly been used.

26:19.996 --> 26:23.205
So we have pineapples,
maraschino cherries, butter.

26:23.249 --> 26:26.208
That to me is a
strong indication

26:26.294 --> 26:27.376
Of a pineapple upside down cake.

26:30.881 --> 26:31.714
Dayveon: Olive oil was used.

26:31.841 --> 26:32.673
Olive oil.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.008
There's brown sugar,
regular butter.

26:34.218 --> 26:36.427
Donovan: I think we're
making some type of cake.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.597
Dayveon: There are only a
few things that come to mind

26:39.640 --> 26:40.598
When I think of olive oil.
Olive oil cake.

26:40.683 --> 26:42.141
Donovan: Hummingbird cake, bro.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.017
Dayveon: It could be
a hummingbird cake.

26:43.185 --> 26:44.393
There's pineapple.

26:44.478 --> 26:45.978
It's garnished with maraschino
cherries.

26:46.147 --> 26:48.272
Those are the elements
of a hummingbird cake.

26:50.735 --> 26:51.567
Hannah: Smell
that, what is that?

26:51.652 --> 26:52.067
Ok, a blood orange.

26:52.153 --> 26:53.235
This is red.

26:53.613 --> 26:54.528
Michelle: Oh, yeah, there's
blood oranges everywhere.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.196
Ok, so we're definitely
blood oranges.

26:56.991 --> 26:59.033
Tarsha: There's juice here.

27:00.161 --> 27:01.035
It smells like orange.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.202
And it's red.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.413
Blood orange?

27:06.083 --> 27:07.916
Kathleen: Strawberries.
Hannah: Blackberries are used.

27:08.669 --> 27:09.752
Tarsha: Look, look, look.

27:09.879 --> 27:11.253
This one's used, that one's not.
Kristy: Ok.

27:11.672 --> 27:13.088
Fadi: Oh, what is that?

27:13.215 --> 27:15.132
T: I don't know but I think the
blood orange zest is in there.

27:16.344 --> 27:17.217
(buzzer sounds)

27:18.763 --> 27:19.470
Fadi: Oh, 10
seconds, 10 seconds.

27:19.597 --> 27:20.721
T: 10 seconds, oh, god.

27:20.806 --> 27:21.972
Donovan: 10 seconds,
10 seconds, 10 seconds.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.933
Tarsha: Brown
sugar, white sugar.

27:25.061 --> 27:25.643
Michelle: Have you checked the
freezer?

27:25.728 --> 27:26.477
Torre: Yeah.

27:26.604 --> 27:27.061
Joel mchale: Three.

27:27.229 --> 27:27.853
Two.

27:28.022 --> 27:28.395
One.

27:28.522 --> 27:29.730
That is time!

27:31.484 --> 27:33.025
That's time, thank you.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.193
Joel mchale: Head
to your kitchens.

27:36.072 --> 27:38.113
Torre: I finally find
the garbage can and I see

27:38.199 --> 27:40.157
What I think is the bottom
of a lemon that's cut off.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.867
And then time expired, so we
couldn't inspect it anymore.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.995
Joel mchale: You'll now have two
hours

27:45.081 --> 27:47.122
To recreate the mystery dessert.

27:47.208 --> 27:48.999
Tarsha: I feel like
we've missed something.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.376
If we missed something,
it could send us home.

27:57.551 --> 27:58.509
T: Ok.

27:58.594 --> 27:59.510
Fadi: Ah.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.011
Joel mchale: Ok,
you have two hours

28:01.097 --> 28:02.054
To make what you think
is the mystery dessert

28:03.516 --> 28:06.058
Based on the clues you found
in the crime scene kitchen.

28:06.185 --> 28:09.520
The team who is furthest
from the mystery dessert

28:09.605 --> 28:10.396
Will be eliminated.

28:11.482 --> 28:12.314
Tarsha: We got two hours.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.732
We better figure something out.

28:15.277 --> 28:15.901
Dayveon: I saw pineapples.

28:16.028 --> 28:16.902
Donovan: Yes.

28:16.987 --> 28:18.112
Dayveon: Maraschino cherries.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.905
Donovan: You thinking
hummingbird cake?

28:19.990 --> 28:20.823
Dayveon: I'm thinking
a hummingbird cake.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.032
Donovan: That makes sense.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.243
For this elimination bake,
we're making a hummingbird cake.

28:24.328 --> 28:25.077
Dayveon: There's pineapple.
Donovan: Pineapple.

28:25.162 --> 28:26.537
Dayveon: Olive oil.

28:26.664 --> 28:29.790
A classic hummingbird cake,
those elements are in there.

28:29.917 --> 28:31.959
I hope we're right.
We ain't going to know.

28:32.086 --> 28:33.502
However, I still have some
reservations.

28:33.587 --> 28:35.838
Donovan: Are all the elements
of a hummingbird cake

28:36.006 --> 28:37.047
Prevalent inside
of that kitchen?

28:37.341 --> 28:39.550
Dayveon: Maybe I'm just
playing tricks on myself.

28:39.635 --> 28:40.217
I don't know.

28:42.596 --> 28:44.304
Hannah: Please tell me
you've got a fantastic idea.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.723
Kathleen: I do, I actually
do have an ok idea.

28:45.808 --> 28:46.265
Hannah: You do have a
fantastic idea. Kathleen: I do!

28:46.350 --> 28:47.433
Hannah: Ok.

28:47.852 --> 28:49.685
My brain was stuck. I'm like,
there's only one cake pan.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.605
Kathleen: I'm thinking it's a
blood orange upside down cake.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.023
Don't you think?
Hannah: Good idea.

28:55.151 --> 28:58.193
We've decided to make a
blood orange upside down cake

28:58.279 --> 28:59.403
Garnished with blackberries.

28:59.488 --> 29:02.114
With an upside down
cake, you put the fruit

29:02.199 --> 29:04.366
On the bottom of the pan
with your batter on top

29:04.452 --> 29:06.952
So when you flip it over, the
fruit is embedded in the cake.

29:07.788 --> 29:09.037
Ok, this is your last chance.

29:09.832 --> 29:11.165
Are we using pineapple at all?

29:12.168 --> 29:14.585
Kathleen: I say, no.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.086
Hannah: We saw the blackberries

29:16.172 --> 29:17.588
And we wanted
something to represent

29:17.631 --> 29:20.257
What the cherry would in a
pineapple upside down cake.

29:20.342 --> 29:22.009
Kathleen: If we're not
going to put pineapple,

29:22.178 --> 29:22.718
I don't see why we
would put cherries.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.386
Hannah: Ok.

29:24.513 --> 29:25.262
Kathleen: Do you
know what I mean?

29:25.389 --> 29:25.679
Hannah: Right.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.391
Tarsha: Oh, look
how pretty that is.

29:29.477 --> 29:31.351
Do you see the juice
that comes out of this?

29:31.437 --> 29:32.978
This is the same color
that was on the board.

29:33.481 --> 29:35.689
I see purple juice that was just
like

29:35.816 --> 29:38.275
What was in the crime scene
kitchen, on the cutting board,

29:38.527 --> 29:40.235
And it made me think
we're just going to go

29:40.362 --> 29:42.154
With the blood orange
upside down cake

29:42.323 --> 29:43.489
And pray to the
gods or the judges,

29:43.657 --> 29:47.242
Whichever one will get us
out of the elimination,

29:47.369 --> 29:49.077
That it's correct.
(kirsty laughs)

29:49.205 --> 29:49.828
I don't have any faith in this
whatsoever.

29:49.914 --> 29:50.746
Kristy: That's ok.

29:50.873 --> 29:52.664
Tarsha: I'm going to be sick.

29:52.708 --> 29:53.749
Kristy: I don't need you to be
negative around my cake again.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.796
Joel mchale: Well,
well, well, well.

29:58.881 --> 30:00.005
T: Hey, papa joel.

30:00.174 --> 30:01.122
Joel mchale: Hey, look,
we're back again, guys.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.341
Fadi: Oh, my god.

30:02.676 --> 30:04.635
Joel mchale: Except the
stakes have never been higher.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.677
And by the way, I love steaks.

30:05.763 --> 30:06.553
(t laughs)

30:06.597 --> 30:08.222
What are we making, guys?

30:08.307 --> 30:10.516
T: So we're going to make
a blood orange zested

30:10.601 --> 30:11.850
Pineapple upside down cake.

30:12.853 --> 30:15.020
We know there's
blood orange used.

30:15.105 --> 30:16.897
We are positive pineapple
rings were used.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.398
Joel mchale: Are
you more confident

30:18.484 --> 30:20.108
Or less confident
than last time?

30:20.236 --> 30:22.152
Fadi: I would say less, tbh.

30:22.988 --> 30:23.904
T: I would say we are
more confused. (laughs)

30:24.031 --> 30:25.948
Fadi: Yeah.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.449
T: I can't be confident about
anything

30:27.576 --> 30:29.076
After the last round, so I'm
terrified.

30:30.079 --> 30:32.204
Joel mchale: So now, t.
T: Talk to me.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.580
Joel mchale: You
are in the circus.

30:33.666 --> 30:34.665
T: I am a trapeze artist.

30:34.750 --> 30:35.999
Joel mchale: You're
a trapeze artist.

30:36.210 --> 30:37.376
T: So anything that hangs
from the ceiling is my jam.

30:37.628 --> 30:38.627
Joel mchale: And you can
do all the flips and stuff.

30:38.712 --> 30:39.920
T: All the flips and stuff.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.380
Joel mchale: How are you
applying your circus skills

30:41.507 --> 30:43.215
To the bake?

30:43.342 --> 30:46.051
T: Well, in circus, you are
constantly problem solving

30:46.211 --> 30:48.262
Because if you make a drastic
mistake, someone dies.

30:48.556 --> 30:51.181
Joel mchale: Well, last
year, we had someone die.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.017
Joel mchale: 90
minutes remaining.

30:54.103 --> 30:56.061
90 minutes.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.313
Plenty of time left to
choose a new path in life.

31:00.234 --> 31:01.567
Michelle: The only thing we're
definitely nervous, babe,

31:01.652 --> 31:03.944
Is about the fact that you
saw lemon in the garbage,

31:04.029 --> 31:05.112
And I did not see lemon in the
garbage.

31:07.032 --> 31:07.823
Joel mchale: Uh, what
are you guys doing?

31:07.908 --> 31:08.782
Did you want to make something?

31:08.909 --> 31:10.617
It's like the elimination round.

31:10.744 --> 31:11.785
Michelle: We definitely
want to make something.

31:11.912 --> 31:12.911
Joel mchale: What are
you thinking about?

31:12.997 --> 31:14.830
Michelle: We are
thinking it is a citrus,

31:14.874 --> 31:15.581
Blood orange upside down cake.

31:15.666 --> 31:17.249
Joel mchale: Ok.

31:17.334 --> 31:19.543
Michelle: We're hoping that
our citrus upside down cake

31:19.670 --> 31:23.380
With homemade brown sugar
caramel, blood oranges, and
lemons

31:23.507 --> 31:25.549
Is the cake that's going to
keep us in this competition.

31:25.634 --> 31:26.884
Torre: The biggest problem
that we're running into

31:27.052 --> 31:29.303
With the lemon is the
fact that I'm not 100%

31:29.388 --> 31:31.013
That that's the fruit that
was in the garbage can.

31:31.140 --> 31:32.306
I mean, if we saw
something nobody else saw,

31:33.934 --> 31:36.226
That would be a benefit
if we get it right.

31:36.312 --> 31:37.394
I just don't want
to go home. (laughs)

31:37.980 --> 31:41.106
Joel mchale: One
hour left, one hour!

31:41.150 --> 31:43.233
So I'm going to
take a bubble bath.

31:44.320 --> 31:44.943
You guys keep baking.

31:45.029 --> 31:46.320
Michelle: Okie dokie.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.405
Get a little bit more on
the edge. Torre: Yeah, yeah.

31:48.490 --> 31:49.031
Hannah: Ok.

31:49.158 --> 31:50.741
Get her in the oven.

31:52.953 --> 31:54.036
Curtis stone: Baking under
the pressure of elimination

31:54.163 --> 31:55.704
Is extremely difficult.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.623
You're trying to remember
all the clues that you saw,

31:57.708 --> 31:58.498
And you're on a clock.

31:58.542 --> 31:59.666
You're thinking to yourself,

31:59.793 --> 32:02.336
"this could be my last
bake in this kitchen,"

32:02.421 --> 32:03.128
And nobody wants that.

32:03.297 --> 32:04.254
Dayveon: You think we got this?

32:04.340 --> 32:04.671
Donovan: I know we got this.

32:04.840 --> 32:05.547
It's a cake.

32:05.633 --> 32:06.715
We can do a cake, man.

32:06.800 --> 32:07.591
Dayveon: We can do a cake.

32:07.718 --> 32:08.592
Donovan: We can do a cake.

32:10.054 --> 32:10.594
Dayveon: Oh!

32:13.265 --> 32:14.598
I didn't see cream cheese,

32:14.767 --> 32:15.474
And that's the icing that
goes with a hummingbird cake.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.309
Donovan: Yeah, that's true.

32:17.394 --> 32:18.060
Dayveon: So maybe it's
not a hummingbird cake.

32:18.187 --> 32:18.977
Donovan: That's true.

32:19.772 --> 32:20.979
Dayveon: I'm just thinking,

32:21.106 --> 32:24.107
Like what if it's a
pineapple upside down cake.

32:24.234 --> 32:26.193
Donovan: That's one pan though,
isn't it?

32:26.278 --> 32:29.029
Dayveon: Yeah, and it's
pineapples, and it's cherries.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.117
Joel mchale: Bakers, you
now have 45 minutes left.

32:34.203 --> 32:34.868
Hurry!

32:35.079 --> 32:36.536
I don't want to make you panic!

32:36.956 --> 32:38.205
Dayveon: Scratch the
hummingbird cake.

32:38.332 --> 32:39.456
We're not going to do
the hummingbird cake.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.875
It doesn't have all those
elements that we saw.

32:41.961 --> 32:42.793
I don't feel really
confident about that.

32:42.878 --> 32:44.336
I feel much more confident

32:44.463 --> 32:47.381
About it being an
upside down cake.

32:47.508 --> 32:49.758
We're going to switch it
to a pineapple upside down cake.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.469
Donovan: Do you have
a recipe for that?

32:52.596 --> 32:53.470
Dayveon: No.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.895
Joel mchale: It's make or
break time for our teams

33:01.981 --> 33:03.563
In the dreaded elimination bake.

33:03.649 --> 33:04.898
Fadi: How does it look?

33:05.067 --> 33:05.816
T: I need like five, seven
more minutes on that cake.

33:05.901 --> 33:06.775
Fadi: Great.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.819
Joel mchale: Amazingly,
all our teams

33:08.904 --> 33:10.112
Are making upside down cakes.

33:10.948 --> 33:12.698
Wouldn't it be nuts
if the mystery dessert

33:12.783 --> 33:14.658
Turns out to be a
breakfast burrito?

33:15.577 --> 33:15.993
Dayveon: Cake in.

33:16.078 --> 33:17.244
Oven closed.

33:17.371 --> 33:17.995
Timer.

33:18.205 --> 33:19.413
Donovan: I think we got it.

33:19.623 --> 33:20.872
I think we named the right
swap and the right choice.

33:20.958 --> 33:21.581
Dayveon: I think so too.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.292
Joel mchale: Curtis,
you set the challenge.

33:24.420 --> 33:25.794
Since they're all self-taught
bakers,

33:25.879 --> 33:26.962
Do you think they're at a
disadvantage

33:27.089 --> 33:30.882
Compared to the
classically trained bakers?

33:31.010 --> 33:32.426
Curtis stone: I think when
you're classically trained,

33:32.511 --> 33:34.761
Of course, you have all of
those skills kind of built in.

33:35.806 --> 33:37.139
That said, yolanda
is self-taught,

33:37.349 --> 33:39.224
And she can do stuff that's
way more technical than I can.

33:39.309 --> 33:40.976
It really depends
on the individual.

33:42.229 --> 33:42.811
Joel mchale: Look
at cherry and steph.

33:42.896 --> 33:43.854
In the last round,

33:44.148 --> 33:45.939
Cherry seemed to know
so much about baking.

33:46.066 --> 33:47.816
They're not making
anything right now.

33:47.901 --> 33:49.443
Curtis stone: That's right.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.571
That knowledge alone saved them
from this elimination bake.

33:52.823 --> 33:53.530
Hannah: Ok.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.657
Kathleen: What, how's it feel?

33:55.784 --> 33:56.491
Hannah: Jiggly inside.

33:56.618 --> 33:57.034
Kathleen: Ok.

33:58.162 --> 33:59.411
Curtis stone:
Hannah and kathleen

33:59.496 --> 34:00.495
Keep opening and
closing their oven.

34:00.622 --> 34:01.580
As soon as you open that oven,

34:01.665 --> 34:04.291
You lose like 30
to 40% of the heat.

34:04.418 --> 34:05.542
You stand to
undercook your cake.

34:06.545 --> 34:07.836
I just wish that they'd
have the confidence

34:07.921 --> 34:08.754
To leave that door closed.

34:09.465 --> 34:11.214
Kathleen: It does feel
like jiggly inside.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.632
Michelle: I think it's done.

34:12.760 --> 34:13.759
Curtis stone: As a chef,

34:13.927 --> 34:14.676
That moment when you
turn that cake out,

34:15.387 --> 34:17.387
It's that moment of truth.

34:17.473 --> 34:18.430
Fadi: All right!

34:19.433 --> 34:20.849
Curtis stone: You
pull up that tin

34:20.934 --> 34:21.558
And it either looks perfect...

34:21.643 --> 34:22.225
Torre: Mm-mm.

34:22.936 --> 34:23.643
Curtis stone: Or not.

34:25.481 --> 34:26.730
Dayveon: I'm kind of feeling
like it's a little plain.

34:26.899 --> 34:29.733
Donovan: I want to add
something to give the wow factor

34:29.818 --> 34:31.359
When we pull it from
behind the thing.

34:31.779 --> 34:32.402
Dayveon: We saw butter.

34:32.571 --> 34:33.445
We saw a whole stick gone.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.696
We know that there
was butter used.

34:34.865 --> 34:37.616
So maybe we can pipe
some buttercream on there

34:37.701 --> 34:38.784
And what we'll call it
is maybe we'll just say

34:38.827 --> 34:40.452
It's infused with our glaze.

34:40.537 --> 34:41.745
Donovan: That's why you're
the decorator, baby.

34:41.830 --> 34:42.913
(dayveon laughs)

34:42.998 --> 34:44.664
Yolanda gampp:
What's so important

34:44.708 --> 34:45.874
Is everything you put
on and in your dessert,

34:46.001 --> 34:48.627
You have to truly
believe there was a clue

34:48.754 --> 34:50.295
In the crime scene kitchen
that brought you there.

34:51.673 --> 34:52.839
Curtis stone: All five teams

34:52.966 --> 34:53.590
Are making their version
of an upside down cake,

34:54.551 --> 34:56.551
But each team is using
different ingredients.

34:56.720 --> 34:57.469
Dayveon: How does that look?

34:57.596 --> 34:58.804
Donovan: I actually like that.

34:58.931 --> 35:00.639
Yolanda gampp: If
buttercream is part

35:00.766 --> 35:02.808
Of the mystery dessert,
dayveon and donovan,

35:02.893 --> 35:03.600
They're the only ones doing it.

35:03.727 --> 35:05.018
Curtis stone: Yup.

35:05.145 --> 35:06.561
Joel mchale: Why
don't you just say

35:06.688 --> 35:07.979
What the mystery dessert is
and then we could all go home?

35:08.065 --> 35:08.897
Yolanda gampp: We
like torturing you.

35:08.982 --> 35:10.148
Joel mchale: It's working.

35:11.985 --> 35:17.781
One minute and 15 seconds!

35:17.866 --> 35:19.366
Fadi: Oh, my god, joel.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.659
Joel mchale: Don't
be stressed out!

35:20.744 --> 35:21.159
Kristy: Come on.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.285
Tarsha: Ok, ok.

35:22.496 --> 35:23.954
Joel mchale: You've had
more than enough time.

35:24.039 --> 35:24.788
Kathleen: Ok.
Hannah: Ok.

35:25.374 --> 35:27.874
Fadi: It's the elimination bake,

35:27.960 --> 35:29.793
Like this has to be as
perfect as possible.

35:29.878 --> 35:30.710
Dayveon: We going
to stand by it.

35:30.838 --> 35:31.920
At least we know it tastes good.

35:32.005 --> 35:32.546
Hannah: It might be ok.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.172
Kathleen: It's better.

35:34.258 --> 35:34.631
Hannah: Yeah.

35:34.800 --> 35:35.465
Judges: Three.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.758
Two.

35:37.261 --> 35:37.676
One.

35:39.429 --> 35:41.513
Joel mchale: Prepare yourself
for sweet, sweet judgment.

35:42.099 --> 35:42.639
Kathleen: Ok.

35:45.769 --> 35:46.643
T: Take your glove off.

35:46.728 --> 35:47.727
You look like michael jackson.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.688
Tarsha: I doubt that we
got it exactly right,

35:49.773 --> 35:52.983
But I'm just praying
we got close enough

35:53.110 --> 35:54.776
Not to be eliminated.

35:55.779 --> 35:56.987
Joel mchale: Oh,
cherry and steph,

35:57.114 --> 35:59.489
Please join us to
watch the tasting.

35:59.575 --> 36:01.074
They look so happy.

36:01.785 --> 36:03.451
Fadi and t!

36:04.496 --> 36:06.371
Kristy: They did
pineapple upside down.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.957
Tarsha: Was that jar
of pineapple open?

36:10.377 --> 36:11.835
Fadi: We have made for you
a pineapple upside down cake

36:12.004 --> 36:14.713
With blood orange zest sponge.

36:16.675 --> 36:17.841
Curtis stone: Guys,
what made you think

36:18.051 --> 36:19.593
That pineapple was one of
the primary ingredients?

36:19.678 --> 36:21.386
T: We saw the jar

36:21.471 --> 36:23.263
With not a full stack
of pineapple rings.

36:31.106 --> 36:33.315
Yolanda gampp: The cake
is incredibly moist.

36:33.442 --> 36:36.067
It almost feels like a steamed
pudding.

36:36.153 --> 36:37.402
Curtis stone: That really
is a beautiful cake batter.

36:37.571 --> 36:38.570
Fadi: Thank you.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.155
Joel mchale: Fadi and t,

36:40.282 --> 36:41.907
If the mystery dessert is a
pineapple upside down cake,

36:42.034 --> 36:44.409
Then you could avoid
being eliminated.

36:44.703 --> 36:45.619
Fadi: Thank you.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.037
Joel mchale: Tarsha and kristy!

36:49.333 --> 36:50.165
Wow.

36:51.627 --> 36:52.834
Tarsha: We decided to make

36:52.961 --> 36:55.420
A upside down blood orange cake.

36:58.467 --> 37:00.342
Tarsha: We saw blood orange
juice on the cutting board.

37:01.261 --> 37:04.304
We saw blood oranges next
to the cutting board,

37:04.431 --> 37:06.431
And I saw some in the compost.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.606
Curtis stone: You know, the
piece on the outside here

37:14.691 --> 37:16.274
Is just so delicious.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.692
I'll tell you what, guys.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.611
If the mystery dessert is a
blood orange upside down cake,

37:19.738 --> 37:21.404
You are looking real good.

37:29.164 --> 37:32.165
Hannah: We have made a blood
orange upside down cake

37:32.251 --> 37:33.583
Garnished with blackberry.

37:34.544 --> 37:35.377
T: Blackberries, what?

37:37.798 --> 37:39.172
Yolanda gampp: What clues
in the crime scene kitchen

37:39.258 --> 37:40.632
Led you to make us this dessert?

37:40.801 --> 37:42.008
Kathleen: We saw
the blood orange.

37:42.094 --> 37:45.095
And we did look in the fridge

37:45.180 --> 37:47.722
And we thought that the
blackberries might have been
used.

37:50.852 --> 37:52.477
Curtis stone: There is a
problem with the consistency.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.232
Tarsha: I hope, for their sake,
that it's cooked all the way.

37:58.735 --> 38:00.318
Kristy: Yeah, it
doesn't look done.

38:02.030 --> 38:04.864
Yolanda gampp: Mine
is raw in the center.

38:05.033 --> 38:05.490
Dayveon: It's raw.

38:05.701 --> 38:07.075
They said it's raw.

38:07.828 --> 38:09.035
Kathleen: I'm devastated.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.913
I did not want that
cake to be raw.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.415
Curtis stone: You guys
opened and closed the oven

38:13.458 --> 38:13.915
Quite a few times.

38:14.543 --> 38:16.042
You're going to
underbake your cake.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.795
Take a deep breath and
make a little prayer

38:18.922 --> 38:20.338
'cause you have to really hope

38:20.424 --> 38:22.799
That this is very, very
close to the mystery dessert.

38:22.884 --> 38:24.050
Kathleen: We don't
want to go home.

38:24.303 --> 38:27.095
Hannah: Our first raw cake,
we baked on national tv.

38:29.933 --> 38:31.641
Joel mchale: Michelle and torre!

38:33.645 --> 38:34.352
Michelle: Hi, guys.
Joel mchale: Hi.

38:34.438 --> 38:35.478
Yolanda gampp: Hello.

38:35.564 --> 38:37.689
Torre: We have a
citrus upside down cake

38:37.774 --> 38:38.523
With blood orange and lemon.

38:39.901 --> 38:41.026
Kathleen: And lemon.
Hannah: And lemon.

38:41.194 --> 38:42.360
Curtis stone: Why
blood orange and lemon?

38:43.447 --> 38:45.071
Michelle: Torre thinks that
he saw lemon in the garbage.

38:45.198 --> 38:45.655
I did not see it.

38:47.701 --> 38:48.783
Hannah: They thought it
was a lemon in the garbage.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.201
Joel mchale: If he's wrong,

38:50.370 --> 38:51.661
Will you hold it against him
throughout your marriage?

39:00.130 --> 39:01.546
Curtis stone: I mean, the
lemon's very pleasant.

39:01.673 --> 39:02.255
It really is.

39:02.341 --> 39:03.298
It brings a brightness.

39:05.135 --> 39:06.760
Yolanda gampp: The crumb
of the cake is beautiful.

39:06.887 --> 39:08.303
And I also love the
yellow color of it.

39:09.765 --> 39:11.973
Joel mchale:
Dayveon and donovan!

39:13.310 --> 39:14.642
Dayveon: We definitely saw
a lot of butter in there,

39:14.728 --> 39:17.562
So we created a buttercream

39:17.606 --> 39:19.022
That we just iced the
top of our cake with.

39:19.149 --> 39:21.691
Kristy: Wow, it's so pretty.
Fadi: Damn.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.569
Yolanda gampp: Gentlemen,
what have you made us?

39:24.696 --> 39:29.699
Dayveon: Our version of a
pineapple, blood orange,

39:29.785 --> 39:32.243
Orange upside down cake.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.205
Tarsha: You can't do
an upside down cake

39:35.290 --> 39:36.081
And have frosting on it.

39:37.084 --> 39:38.208
Curtis stone: Guys,
I look at this

39:38.377 --> 39:40.627
And I don't see an upside
down pineapple cake.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.009
I don't see the
caramelized layer.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.428
And of course, I
don't see the fruit.

39:50.597 --> 39:51.429
Dayveon: Yeah.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.850
Curtis stone: If
I close my eyes,

39:55.936 --> 39:57.560
I think I'm eating
a hummingbird cake,

39:57.646 --> 39:58.728
Which I really like, by the way.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.272
You're actually the only team

40:01.400 --> 40:03.149
That hasn't made an
upside down cake.

40:03.235 --> 40:06.069
And the only team that did
the pie with saltine crackers,

40:07.531 --> 40:07.987
They won.

40:09.074 --> 40:09.864
Yolanda gampp:
What specific clues

40:09.991 --> 40:11.032
In the crime scene kitchen

40:11.159 --> 40:13.243
Led you towards
making a buttercream?

40:14.496 --> 40:16.287
Dayveon: Well, there was
butter in the kitchen.

40:18.667 --> 40:19.749
I hope we're right.

40:19.876 --> 40:20.792
Donovan: This has to be the cake

40:20.919 --> 40:23.086
That's closer than
anybody else's.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.130
Dayveon: Yeah, or we could
really be going home, bro.

40:26.174 --> 40:28.174
Joel mchale: The
elimination bake is over

40:28.301 --> 40:29.551
And the tasting is done.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.929
Kathleen: We have sacrificed
so much to be here.

40:33.014 --> 40:35.515
We don't want a raw
cake sending us home.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.392
Joel mchale: Reveal the mystery
dessert!

40:38.687 --> 40:41.229
Donovan: I'm praying right
now that I'm not going home.

40:47.529 --> 40:49.612
Joel mchale: Welcome back
to crime scene kitchen.

40:49.698 --> 40:51.072
Here's where things stand.

40:51.533 --> 40:54.117
Four teams gave us
four different takes

40:54.202 --> 40:55.994
On an upside down cake,

40:56.246 --> 40:59.164
And dayveon and donovan
baked a pineapple cake

40:59.249 --> 41:00.582
With american buttercream.

41:01.376 --> 41:02.542
Dayveon: Whatever it is
that comes out of here,

41:02.627 --> 41:04.461
I am hoping that there's
buttercream on there.

41:06.298 --> 41:07.547
Joel mchale:
Confectionator 3000,

41:08.341 --> 41:10.008
Reveal the mystery dessert!

41:10.135 --> 41:11.676
(dramatic music)

41:17.767 --> 41:19.559
Kathleen: What is it?

41:24.065 --> 41:25.648
Fadi: My heart's
like beating so fast.

41:30.363 --> 41:31.779
Joel mchale: An upside down cake

41:31.907 --> 41:34.115
Topped with caramel,
oranges, and blood oranges.

41:39.247 --> 41:40.955
Tarsha: Thank you, god

41:41.041 --> 41:42.707
'cause we just pulled
that one out. I swear.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.793
Torre: There was absolutely no
lemons so we were very wrong.
(laughs)

41:46.046 --> 41:49.464
We are one of the only two teams

41:49.591 --> 41:51.341
That did not make a citrus
upside down cake. So yeah,
we're...

41:51.426 --> 41:52.967
T: Eh.

41:54.304 --> 41:59.432
Donovan: A blood orange, orange
upside down cake. Man.

42:01.561 --> 42:03.353
Joel mchale: Curtis,
walk us through the clues

42:03.438 --> 42:04.854
That should have led the
bakers to this.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.356
Curtis stone: Here's how

42:06.399 --> 42:07.565
They should have
gotten that answer.

42:07.734 --> 42:08.900
Though many fruits were present,

42:09.611 --> 42:11.694
There were no signs that
the pineapples were used.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.405
T: That jar of pineapples

42:14.533 --> 42:16.199
Will haunt me till the
day I die. Fadi: 100.

42:16.952 --> 42:18.701
Curtis stone: The remnants of
blood orange in the compost

42:18.870 --> 42:20.411
And navel oranges in the trash,

42:21.790 --> 42:23.164
Along with the stains
on the cutting board

42:23.333 --> 42:27.418
Told you only blood oranges and
navel oranges were included.

42:29.005 --> 42:30.046
The cake tin in the sink

42:30.131 --> 42:32.590
Had remnants of
caramel in the bottom,

42:32.634 --> 42:35.093
A clue that today's dessert
was inverted after baking,

42:36.596 --> 42:37.720
Leading to an upside down cake.

42:39.015 --> 42:41.432
Joel mchale: Ok, guys,
who fell short tonight?

42:44.646 --> 42:45.979
Curtis stone: On balance,

42:46.189 --> 42:47.355
The team that performed the
worst in this elimination bake

42:48.900 --> 42:50.441
And who's going home tonight is

42:56.700 --> 42:58.324
Dayveon and donovan.

43:03.623 --> 43:05.415
I'm sorry, guys.

43:05.584 --> 43:07.625
And what you baked was actually
delicious.

43:08.086 --> 43:10.044
But unfortunately,

43:10.130 --> 43:11.337
You were just nowhere
near the mystery dessert.

43:12.215 --> 43:13.590
Donovan: The name is crime scene
kitchen,

43:13.675 --> 43:16.342
And I think that we got the
clues a little too wrong.

43:16.428 --> 43:18.636
Dayveon: Yolanda,
you're everything to me.

43:18.763 --> 43:20.054
Thank you for being you.

43:21.224 --> 43:22.682
Joel mchale: Thank
you so much, guys.

43:22.767 --> 43:24.642
A big round of applause
for donovan and dayveon.

43:24.728 --> 43:26.686
(contestants cheer)

43:29.190 --> 43:31.399
Dayveon: These tears are
not tears of sadness.

43:31.443 --> 43:33.651
I'm just happy right now that
I got to do this with my bro.

43:34.321 --> 43:37.071
Donovan: This was the
most bonding experience

43:37.198 --> 43:39.240
That we've had since we've
became brothers and...

43:39.367 --> 43:40.575
Dayveon: Facts.

43:40.660 --> 43:41.326
Donovan: And I wouldn't
change it for the world.

43:41.453 --> 43:42.493
Dayveon: Facts.

43:42.662 --> 43:43.369
Donovan: I wouldn't
change it for the world.

43:43.455 --> 43:43.870
Dayveon: Facts.

43:44.331 --> 43:45.580
Joel mchale: All right, you guys

43:45.665 --> 43:46.998
And our safety bake
winners, steph and cherry,

43:47.125 --> 43:49.584
Have all survived.

43:49.711 --> 43:52.712
You have next week off so we
can challenge the other group,

43:52.797 --> 43:56.007
Your competition, the
classically trained bakers.

43:56.134 --> 43:58.009
Good night, everyone, and please
enjoy

43:58.136 --> 43:59.677
Whatever show gordon
ramsey's hawking after this.

43:59.763 --> 44:02.013
Curtis stone: Well
done you guys.
