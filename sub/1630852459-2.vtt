00:19.561 --> 00:22.230
Times Square
was sex, sex, sex everywhere.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.401
There were men everywhere

00:27.986 --> 00:29.571
seeking what they were seeking.

00:33.116 --> 00:36.161
It wasn't just one or two girls
standing on a street corner.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.665
There were girls everywhere…

00:43.543 --> 00:46.713
and I was one of them for 13 years.

00:53.720 --> 00:58.016
One night I was out there,
and, uh, I had gotten into this car.

00:59.934 --> 01:03.063
This guy,
he was just some younger white guy.

01:03.938 --> 01:06.399
-I mean, normal-looking person.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.735
He didn't look, you know,
deranged or anything.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.737
And, um…
when I got in the car,

01:10.820 --> 01:13.948
I told this man to drive and take a left.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.661
And he didn't. He took a right.

01:21.122 --> 01:25.502
So he took me down to some…
by the river somewhere.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.296
And he had a gun.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.467
My heart just sank 'cause I knew…
I knew what was gonna happen.

01:32.550 --> 01:35.762
-When someone thinks they've bought you,

01:35.845 --> 01:38.640
they think they could
do whatever they want to with you.

01:41.017 --> 01:43.478
And he did rape me, and he did rob me.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.985
And then he told me, "Get out of the car,
and don't turn around."

01:55.949 --> 01:59.119
And I… I didn't. I got out of the car,
and I didn't turn around.

02:01.704 --> 02:04.165
I thought he was still
gonna shoot me in the back.

02:06.876 --> 02:10.505
I know my mind
kind of left my body during that.

02:16.427 --> 02:17.554
It was horrible.

02:17.637 --> 02:21.141
It's beyond horrible.
There's no word to describe it.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.732
I'm pretty sure that I was
in the car with a serial killer,

02:31.442 --> 02:33.403
and I don't know why he didn't kill me.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.197
I don't know why.

03:09.063 --> 03:10.982
This past December,
we told you about

03:11.065 --> 03:13.359
an especially brutal murder
at a Times Square motel.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.862
A man killed some women
and cut off their heads.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.787
<i> The killer police want</i>

03:24.871 --> 03:27.582
<i>may be guilty</i>
<i>of other crimes against prostitutes.</i>

03:33.379 --> 03:37.800
When I read the headlines
about a murder at the Travel Inn…

03:39.844 --> 03:43.139
and I hear a report
about a murder at the Hotel Seville…

03:45.683 --> 03:49.729
that's when I realized there are people
that are walking around out there

03:49.812 --> 03:52.273
that are pure predators.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.235
There's no… there's no stopping 'em.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.614
Once you start cutting pieces
off of people,

03:59.697 --> 04:02.909
once you start beheading people,
cutting hands off of people,

04:02.992 --> 04:04.327
you're getting on the news.

04:06.037 --> 04:11.793
And, uh, the city started calling
these homicides the Torso Killings.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.802
At the time
of the Times Square torso murders,

04:20.885 --> 04:23.638
it was what we sometimes called
tongue-in-cheek,

04:23.721 --> 04:26.015
the golden age of serial murder,

04:26.099 --> 04:28.184
1970 to 2000.

04:30.353 --> 04:34.732
You have about 82% of all
20th-century American serial killers

04:34.816 --> 04:37.277
emerge in that 30-year period.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.362


04:43.157 --> 04:44.450
At that time,

04:44.534 --> 04:46.619
people were very aware
of what a serial killer was,

04:46.703 --> 04:49.122
and it was on people's minds.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.543
The Torso Killings occurred

04:53.626 --> 04:55.545
less than two years

04:55.628 --> 04:56.963
after the Summer of Sam.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.924
These were the Son of Sam killings
in New York City.

05:00.008 --> 05:03.177
<i>This photograph of the man</i>
<i>accused of killing six and wounding seven</i>

05:03.261 --> 05:05.263
<i>was taken by police this morning.</i>

05:05.346 --> 05:08.182
<i>He confessed after he told them</i>
<i>he was a killing machine</i>

05:08.266 --> 05:10.852
<i>ordered by a voice</i>
<i>speaking through a neighbor's dog</i>

05:10.935 --> 05:13.938
<i>to carry out his bloody outrages</i>
<i>against young, pretty women.</i>

05:15.273 --> 05:21.821
The idea of having another serial killer
out there again, absolutely terrifying.

05:24.615 --> 05:27.952
You wanna get him off the street
before he kills somebody else.

05:29.370 --> 05:30.955
He's a ticking time bomb.

05:39.464 --> 05:43.134
The NYPD started a task force…

05:48.431 --> 05:50.725
and set in motion a tremendous effort

05:51.476 --> 05:54.520
over a wide range
of law enforcement officers,

05:55.897 --> 05:58.358
NYPD officers of various units.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.653
We knew we were dealing
with a serial killer,

06:02.737 --> 06:04.697
a psychopathic sexual sadist,

06:05.281 --> 06:07.533
and he's targeting prostitutes.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.330
Some serial killers like to dispose
of the bodies and hide them,

06:12.413 --> 06:13.790
so the authorities are not aware.

06:14.457 --> 06:18.002
But this guy,
he gets off on the presentation,

06:18.086 --> 06:21.506
shocking people
and doing outrageous things to the bodies.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.930
So to me, it speaks to someone
who's a malignant narcissist,

06:29.013 --> 06:31.808
who considers themselves
smarter than the police,

06:31.891 --> 06:34.811
and he wants to kind of, like, taunt you.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.688
"I'm superior to you,
and you're dumb, and you won't catch me."

06:37.772 --> 06:40.233
Well, you keep waiting, you asshole.
We're gonna catch you.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.909
<i> They work</i>
<i>the stroll on 11th Avenue.</i>

06:49.992 --> 06:52.245
<i>Tonight, these hookers were scared.</i>

06:53.121 --> 06:56.541
<i>It's… it's frightening, you know.</i>
<i>It's… it's very scary.</i>

06:56.624 --> 06:57.667
<i>I mean, you know,</i>

06:57.750 --> 07:01.170
<i>I just hope whoever it… whoever it is,</i>
<i>just please get him, you know what I mean?</i>

07:01.254 --> 07:03.548
<i>So the girls</i>
<i>be able to work safely out here.</i>

07:06.259 --> 07:09.387
But I remember fear
rippling through the track.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.265
That community of us…

07:12.348 --> 07:15.476
of us… girls.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.853
We would all talk.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.982
They knew
that there were dangerous johns showing up

07:21.065 --> 07:23.568
that they had
to protect themselves against.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.238
They all knew each other,
and they had warning signs.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.450
If somebody got in a car and drove off,

07:30.533 --> 07:32.952
they often had somebody
who was looking out for them

07:33.035 --> 07:34.912
and making sure that they came back.

07:41.836 --> 07:45.548
At this point, the investigation
was concentrating on johns,

07:45.631 --> 07:46.632
and rightfully so.

07:48.092 --> 07:51.220
Serial killers predate
within a zone,

07:51.304 --> 07:54.682
and his zone was Times Square.

07:54.765 --> 07:57.185
And that was a place to pick up his prey.

07:58.686 --> 08:02.231
You had a lot of abusive johns
in the Times Square area

08:02.315 --> 08:05.735
who got forceful, got violent, got mean.

08:05.818 --> 08:10.072
You gotta filter through 'em.
Who's just a mean guy, or who's a killer?

08:11.657 --> 08:13.868
So in a case like this,

08:14.452 --> 08:16.913
police would do prostitution sweeps.

08:17.747 --> 08:21.000
Undercovers would go
into these prostitution-prone areas

08:21.584 --> 08:24.504
and talk to 'em,
each and every one of them,

08:25.796 --> 08:26.881
one by one.

08:28.382 --> 08:31.344
The investigators
were interviewing prostitutes

08:32.136 --> 08:35.806
to see if anyone knew anything about johns
of the victims who were killed.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.644
And they asked them, "Have you had
any problems with johns in the area?"

08:45.274 --> 08:46.609
I was out on the street,

08:46.692 --> 08:49.820
and these detectives
were trying to talk to me,

08:50.655 --> 08:52.281
and I didn't wanna talk to them,

08:53.324 --> 08:55.910
and finally, I just gave up,
and I was like, "What?"

08:57.203 --> 09:00.164
And they said,
"Another girl was killed last night."

09:02.208 --> 09:04.252
"This guy has killed many girls."

09:04.335 --> 09:06.087
"Please, do you know this face?"

09:08.798 --> 09:09.882
I thought,

09:11.592 --> 09:14.220
"Yeah, I remember that face."

09:15.888 --> 09:20.351
But when the police asked me
if I knew this man,

09:21.018 --> 09:22.645
I told them no. I lied.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.648
I lied to them

09:26.607 --> 09:29.652
because I was so scared
of my trafficker Moses

09:29.735 --> 09:32.446
and what he would do to me
if I talked to the police.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.740
Now, this isn't a simple thing.

09:34.824 --> 09:38.703
This isn't like what you see on TV,
where the detectives pull up to the corner

09:38.786 --> 09:41.831
to one streetwalker
who tells them what they need to know.

09:41.914 --> 09:46.043
Very often, prostitutes are not likely
to cooperate with police.

09:46.127 --> 09:49.297
They don't want to be seen
cooperating with the police.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.424
There's been
so many cops out there,

09:51.507 --> 09:53.884
and you gotta keep running
every time you see 'em.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.849
The relationship
between sex workers and police is fraught.

09:59.932 --> 10:05.605
There were times the policing
could be harsh, cruel, and out of step.

10:06.814 --> 10:09.734
You wouldn't tell the police
if you'd been assaulted by a john.

10:09.817 --> 10:10.901
There's no way.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.529
Because you were doing something illegal,

10:13.613 --> 10:17.742
and so you were putting yourself
into danger of being arrested.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.788
And when you have an arrest
for prostitution,

10:22.872 --> 10:25.958
that can cut off all sorts
of avenues for credit,

10:26.042 --> 10:28.169
for an apartment, for another job,

10:28.252 --> 10:31.464
even for retaining custody
of your children.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.424
It will be used against you.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.346
I still, to this day, feel bad about that

10:38.429 --> 10:40.973
because I didn't tell them the truth,
you know, I…

10:43.726 --> 10:46.312
But telling them the truth,

10:46.395 --> 10:48.314
that's the last thing that I could do.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.656
When you living this life,
you only live day-to-day.

10:57.531 --> 11:00.701
You don't think about tomorrow,
and you don't think about yesterday.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.953
Just day by day.

11:05.331 --> 11:09.043
Because the industry
is criminalized,

11:09.126 --> 11:13.881
you create a very dangerous situation
for women working on the street.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.010
There were sexual predators

11:18.094 --> 11:22.181
stalking and preying
on women who were marginalized…

11:24.475 --> 11:27.436
because they were not protected
by the police.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.608
Girls were,
you know, just easy targets,

11:33.693 --> 11:35.236
but it didn't matter.

11:35.861 --> 11:39.240
When you're out there, you--
Nothing can keep you off the street.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.452
Because I was told
I had to do whatever I had to do

11:43.536 --> 11:45.162
to get as much money as I could.

11:46.288 --> 11:49.500
Prostitution is a… is a business
that keeps money circulating,

11:49.583 --> 11:53.504
and that's what your… that's what the goal
is all about, to get money.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.214
Is it worth it?

11:55.715 --> 11:58.592
Uh. Yeah, I come out ahead.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.846
You can make up to a thousand a night.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.639
It's quick. It's easy, you know?

12:04.432 --> 12:07.268
It is kind of dangerous.
Everything is dangerous.

12:09.311 --> 12:12.064
Transactional sex
is part of the way society

12:12.148 --> 12:13.941
has developed for millennia.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.194
For some sex workers,

12:18.070 --> 12:20.573
it's how people survive
and how people thrive.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.451
In New York generally,

12:23.534 --> 12:26.871
Times Square operated
as a known sexual district,

12:26.954 --> 12:29.707
and it had been, of course, for decades.

12:39.216 --> 12:43.679
At the turn of the century,
prostitutes were walking the streets.

12:43.763 --> 12:47.141
There were women
leaning out of windows soliciting.

12:48.392 --> 12:52.271
The city fathers didn't much care,
so it… it was everywhere.

12:54.190 --> 12:58.360
Times Square developed into the greatest
entertainment district in America.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.323
<i>The Great White Way,</i>

13:02.406 --> 13:05.075
<i>the street that is paved</i>
<i>with tears and laughter.</i>

13:06.827 --> 13:09.205
<i>There are more picture palaces</i>
<i>and theaters here</i>

13:09.288 --> 13:11.081
<i>than any other street on Earth.</i>

13:12.625 --> 13:14.710
So at the peak
of the Roaring '20s,

13:15.211 --> 13:18.631
the cult of the chorus girl
developed on 42nd Street,

13:18.714 --> 13:22.051
attracting thousands of pretty women

13:22.134 --> 13:23.803
from all over the country

13:23.886 --> 13:25.513
coming here hoping to get jobs.

13:27.056 --> 13:30.226
Many of them, when they couldn't launch
an entertainment career,

13:30.726 --> 13:34.021
ended up becoming prostitutes
to make some money.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.153
Over time,

13:42.530 --> 13:46.700
Times Square became a prostitute's
promenade, as they called it.

13:50.371 --> 13:54.458
By the 1970s,
things had changed in the sex industry

13:55.501 --> 13:59.171
when pimping becomes a cultural icon.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.423
-Hey, where you going?
-I'll be back, honey.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.593
You had all these
blaxploitation films coming out

14:04.677 --> 14:08.430
making heroes out of figures
like Iceberg Slim,

14:08.514 --> 14:11.392
who controlled women and who made money.

14:12.434 --> 14:15.729
When I ask you a question,
you answer.

14:17.439 --> 14:20.025
I was around 12, maybe 12 and a half,

14:21.485 --> 14:25.531
when Moses first brought me
up to New York City.

14:28.826 --> 14:33.539
He would tattoo this cross
on all of his girls' hands…

14:36.041 --> 14:41.088
like a branding, some kind of, um…
uh, you know, property of ownership.

14:43.591 --> 14:46.176
He made it very clear
that he was the one in charge,

14:47.136 --> 14:51.348
and he also made sure that I saw
he had a big Glock in his belt, a gun.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.437
Isn't it true,
pimps keep their girls

14:56.520 --> 14:58.439
working on the streets
by threats or by force?

14:58.522 --> 14:59.356
Oh yes.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.526
Any of the girls
ever hold out on you?

15:02.610 --> 15:04.820
-One time.
-What did you do about it?

15:05.404 --> 15:08.908
Well, she and I had a little talk,
and then she went to the hospital.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.410
When she came back,
she didn't hold out again.

15:11.493 --> 15:15.456
-What did you do to her?
-I had an argument with my belt with her.

15:20.002 --> 15:23.505
<i>It's nothing to hear that a girl</i>
<i>got killed or that a girl got beat up.</i>

15:23.589 --> 15:26.467
<i>It's an occupational hazard,</i>
<i>and it happens to everybody.</i>

15:26.550 --> 15:30.137
<i>They say, "She's the third one today,</i>
<i>or she's the third one this week."</i>

15:32.222 --> 15:36.060
They were getting constantly
put in these traumatic situations

15:36.143 --> 15:38.604
where they were
getting abused by the pimps

15:38.687 --> 15:40.439
and abused by the johns

15:41.065 --> 15:44.193
who wanted to take their anger out
on these sex workers.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.905
It was so easy for my mother's killer

15:47.988 --> 15:51.825
to get away with torturing young women.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.496
Horrific things happened

15:56.538 --> 15:59.166
on the street all the time.

16:06.632 --> 16:11.220
The investigators
went through mountains of dead ends,

16:11.303 --> 16:15.724
and all these detectives
had to think outside the box.

16:18.435 --> 16:22.564
Detectives started looking
at arrest records for johns in the area

16:22.648 --> 16:24.650
that had assaulted prostitutes.

16:25.651 --> 16:30.197
One of the detectives
pulled the records from two cases

16:30.280 --> 16:34.910
that might hint at someone,
uh, who committed this crime.

16:36.704 --> 16:42.876
Both crimes took place years before,
in 1973 and in 1974.

16:44.211 --> 16:48.549
In both cases,
the complainants are working girls.

16:49.758 --> 16:53.595
One of the charges
was actually filed by the girls' pimp.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.059
They claimed that the perpetrator

16:59.143 --> 17:01.687
would not let them go.

17:03.439 --> 17:08.569
He… he insisted
on keeping them in his car,

17:08.652 --> 17:11.780
and one of them says
that he took her money.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.910
In both cases,
he took their costume jewelry.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.080
Jewelry wasn't expensive.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.206
It was a trophy.

17:22.624 --> 17:27.629
He was accused of robbery,
kidnapping, and sexual assault.

17:29.006 --> 17:32.384
So we had crimes
against two different women…

17:34.595 --> 17:35.888
by the same man,

17:37.139 --> 17:38.474
Richard Cottingham.

17:44.521 --> 17:47.733
Richard Cottingham
was an average guy.

17:48.817 --> 17:50.778
He drove an average car,

17:50.861 --> 17:53.489
had an average home in Lodi, New Jersey,

17:54.073 --> 17:58.327
which is nestled there
right close to New York for commuters.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.373
He had a full-time job in New York City

18:03.457 --> 18:07.252
as a computer operator
with Blue Cross and Blue Shield.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.130
He was a family man.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.384
His wife,
she was a fairly typical housewife

18:15.511 --> 18:17.846
raising a daughter and two sons.

18:19.389 --> 18:22.017
When they interviewed Cottingham
in these cases,

18:23.185 --> 18:25.104
he said the women were lying.

18:26.105 --> 18:31.235
He was either at home, or he was at work
at the time of these crimes.

18:31.318 --> 18:34.696
He adamantly denied these charges.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.783
It goes to court,

18:38.492 --> 18:42.287
but the sex workers don't show up
to the trial, to the hearing.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.666
No victim, no crime.

18:47.251 --> 18:50.546
So in 1973 and 1974,

18:50.629 --> 18:53.715
in both cases, the charges were dismissed.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.471
And that's it. It's gone.

19:02.182 --> 19:05.102
But now, in 1980,

19:05.185 --> 19:08.564
now the task force is looking at this guy.

19:09.481 --> 19:14.862
How did Richard Cottingham
fit the profile of the Torso Killer?

19:20.492 --> 19:24.621
Richard Cottingham
comes from a very stable family.

19:24.705 --> 19:28.625
There's nothing in his family history

19:28.709 --> 19:31.503
that is typical of serial killers.

19:32.212 --> 19:36.800
There's no indication
that he was ever abused as a child.

19:37.759 --> 19:40.637
He had a pretty good relationship
with his mother.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.391
He also, uh-- He excelled at work.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.645
Blue Cross and Blue Shield
employed hundreds of people,

19:49.605 --> 19:52.608
and, uh, Richard
was one of their lead employees.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.905
At that point in time,
middle-class men

19:57.988 --> 20:01.408
were not profiled
as being potentially violent,

20:01.491 --> 20:04.328
especially if they were well-spoken,
appeared to be educated,

20:04.411 --> 20:06.371
drove a nice vehicle…

20:06.455 --> 20:08.665
You know, you would think,
"Oh, well, he's okay."

20:12.336 --> 20:14.171
He didn't fit the profile.

20:16.006 --> 20:20.177
And you'd have to eliminate the suspects
based on how the profile doesn't fit them.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.804
That's how it works.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.142
So once again, detectives had no suspects.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.019
Nothing.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.777
When we're talking
about serial killers…

20:38.403 --> 20:41.240
a lot of these guys
are… are moving around.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.161
They're moving around
from borough to borough,

20:46.245 --> 20:47.496
from county to county.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.249
Once they'd cross boundaries,

20:52.000 --> 20:56.463
it becomes far more difficult
to link different crimes together.

20:58.924 --> 21:02.636
Now, if you get out of state,
it was like another planet.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.347
Because back then…

21:07.432 --> 21:10.352
different departments didn't communicate.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.147
So the task force

21:14.231 --> 21:17.234
that was looking for the Torso Killer
in New York City…

21:19.653 --> 21:21.238
had no idea what was going on

21:22.656 --> 21:23.699
in New Jersey.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.811
In May 1980…

21:55.230 --> 21:58.775
about 32 minutes away
from New York City, in New Jersey…

22:01.695 --> 22:03.030
…at the Quality Inn motel.

22:04.573 --> 22:07.075
The maid had gone to clean room 132.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.873
She's vacuuming the room.

22:14.958 --> 22:18.045
Bunk, bunk.
She's hitting something under the bed.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.255
She looks under the bed…

22:24.676 --> 22:26.762
and there's a body of a naked woman

22:26.845 --> 22:29.973
with her hands handcuffed behind her back.

22:33.602 --> 22:36.855
The Bergen County homicide squad
picked up on that case.

22:41.276 --> 22:44.613
There is traces of

22:44.696 --> 22:47.491
adhesive around her mouth,

22:48.700 --> 22:51.119
circular scratches,

22:51.203 --> 22:54.289
cuts around her breasts,

22:54.373 --> 22:58.377
but clearly cause of death
is manual strangulation.

23:01.088 --> 23:05.133
The victim was a young woman
thought to be approximately 19 years old.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.929
Upon printing the victim,

23:10.472 --> 23:12.099
Bergen County Police learned

23:12.182 --> 23:16.978
that she had been arrested
in Miami for prostitution.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.774
Her name was Valerie Street.

23:23.568 --> 23:27.489
And they found out from the authorities
in Miami that she had come to New York.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.203
She'd only been
in town a few days

23:33.703 --> 23:36.540
when she was seen being picked up by a man

23:37.999 --> 23:39.459
and brought to New Jersey.

23:45.340 --> 23:48.802
At the Quality Inn motel,
a processing of the crime scene

23:48.885 --> 23:52.013
revealed that the killer
inadvertently left

23:52.097 --> 23:55.350
a latent print on the handcuff.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.019
So they lift that print.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.231
Remember, in those days, again,
you're doing physical searches,

24:01.314 --> 24:04.985
a guy with one of those eye loupes
looking for the swirls

24:05.068 --> 24:07.779
and trying to identify the print.

24:09.531 --> 24:14.536
But at the time,
that print matched nobody.

24:15.537 --> 24:19.791
Because the killer
wasn't in the system in New Jersey,

24:19.875 --> 24:22.836
so the detectives had no suspects.

24:23.837 --> 24:24.796
Nothing.

24:27.174 --> 24:32.429
The law enforcement agencies
in Bergen County continued to investigate,

24:32.512 --> 24:36.641
and that's when,
uh, one of the detectives

24:37.225 --> 24:40.270
remembered a crime that took place

24:40.854 --> 24:42.314
over two years before

24:42.814 --> 24:47.152
where a woman
was murdered in the same fashion

24:48.487 --> 24:51.364
at the same location, the Quality Inn.

24:52.908 --> 24:57.245
The victim
was a woman named Maryann Carr.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.165
She was a nurse,

25:01.917 --> 25:03.251
not a sex worker.

25:04.753 --> 25:09.216
This was an open homicide
from December 16th, 1977.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.636
She was supposed to meet
her mother-in-law for supper,

25:12.719 --> 25:13.887
and she didn't show up.

25:14.804 --> 25:17.766
They had a witness who saw Maryann Carr

25:17.849 --> 25:20.685
arguing with a man
in the dimly lit parking lot

25:21.811 --> 25:24.606
by her apartment
in Little Ferry, New Jersey.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.904
Her body was found
the following day in the parking lot

25:30.987 --> 25:33.240
of the Quality Inn motel
in Hasbrouck Heights.

25:35.909 --> 25:40.330
There is a ligature
strangulation mark around her throat,

25:41.122 --> 25:44.543
with traces of adhesive
around her mouth as well.

25:45.752 --> 25:49.339
And, of course, the evidence
that she had been handcuffed

25:49.422 --> 25:51.216
both on her ankles and her wrists.

25:53.385 --> 25:57.305
Between Valerie Street
and Maryann Carr,

25:57.389 --> 25:59.724
the connections are becoming very obvious.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.521
This is the same hotel.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.649
Victims handcuffed as well.

26:08.608 --> 26:12.279
There was a determination made
that this was a signature.

26:12.362 --> 26:16.533
This is a signature
of the same killer as Valerie Ann Street.

26:18.285 --> 26:22.038
And now New Jersey had a serial killer.

26:23.832 --> 26:29.170
The Quality Inn motel
appears to be a comfort zone for him.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.716
And… and one thing about serial killers,

26:32.799 --> 26:35.885
the first killings
are usually close to home and/or work.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.846
The best way to explain it is that

26:39.055 --> 26:41.474
they're able to control the environment.

26:42.434 --> 26:47.230
So the Bergen County homicide squad
knew that he was familiar with the area.

26:48.148 --> 26:53.612
With Valerie Street
and Maryann Carr, they have no suspect.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.365
In New Jersey, there's no connection yet

26:58.033 --> 27:00.076
to anyone at this point,

27:00.160 --> 27:03.413
and both of these cases,
they just go dead.

27:03.496 --> 27:05.373
Dead ends. Nothing.

27:06.291 --> 27:10.128
And no one in New Jersey connected them

27:10.211 --> 27:13.548
to the Times Square Torso Killer
in New York.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.851
Walking down the Deuce,

27:26.311 --> 27:31.274
it was shocking and pretty filthy.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.694
My father could have taken 42nd Street

27:35.570 --> 27:37.947
and made it a pretty thing,

27:38.031 --> 27:41.493
but his personality was in the gutter.

27:43.536 --> 27:46.873
And a lot of bad things
happened on 42nd Street

27:46.956 --> 27:48.708
because the porno world was there.

27:51.169 --> 27:54.547
It just created a monster over there.

27:54.631 --> 27:58.968
Seriously. More peep shows,
more freak parlors, more everything.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.178
It has increased.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.430
-What's your feeling?
-They're increasing.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.807
Increasing? Huh?

28:03.890 --> 28:06.601
Every restaurant that closes down,
a peep show opens.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.939
Talk about pushing the envelope.

28:11.022 --> 28:13.733
My father loved pushing the envelope.

28:14.567 --> 28:17.070
His business expanded and expanded,

28:17.153 --> 28:19.906
getting much, much XXX.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.743
And in some of those peep shows,

28:24.577 --> 28:27.247
I mean,
it wasn't only those girls dancing.

28:28.498 --> 28:32.043
My father came in
with having live sex acts.

28:33.420 --> 28:37.298
Now, you know,
there's people having sex on the stage,

28:37.382 --> 28:39.384
and people were just watching
the whole thing.

28:40.093 --> 28:43.304
<i>Oh yeah.</i>
<i>Come on, sugar. It's all live.</i>

28:43.388 --> 28:46.182
<i>And it's all happening right here</i>
<i>at Show World Center.</i>

28:46.683 --> 28:49.686
At Show World,
my wife Brandy and I

28:49.769 --> 28:51.271
got into doing live shows.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.860
So basically, there's a stage with a bed.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.528
No barrier, just a live show.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.532
You're naked.
Your back is to the audience.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.910
It was up to us at that point,

29:05.994 --> 29:07.912
but you had to have
at least three positions

29:07.996 --> 29:11.124
so that the audience
could see the penetration.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.043
And then that's a half-hour show.

29:15.128 --> 29:19.632
People from out of state
would be sitting there like, "Oh, God."

29:19.716 --> 29:21.468
You know? "What is this?"

29:21.551 --> 29:24.262
Meanwhile, the regular patrons
wouldn't even flinch.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.932
And my wife and I did eight shows a day.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.684
We had a following.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.520
Guys would actually come
just to watch her and me.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.107
But men have a tendency to be…

29:36.858 --> 29:39.319
What's the word? Stupid.

29:41.112 --> 29:45.617
They feel that, "Oh, she's naked.
She just did a sex show,

29:45.700 --> 29:47.285
so I can do whatever I want."

29:56.002 --> 29:59.339
In between shows,
Brandy went in the ladies' room.

30:00.423 --> 30:01.716
She was in the stall.

30:02.467 --> 30:05.094
So this guy entered
the bathroom behind her.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.014
He reached under to grab her,

30:08.097 --> 30:11.768
and every time he reached under,
she would hit him with her heels.

30:12.769 --> 30:14.729
I was like, "No, no."

30:14.813 --> 30:18.191
Walked up to him
and proceeded to beat the shit out of him.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.613
That's the mentality
that we were dealing with.

30:23.696 --> 30:27.700
It was either you were a victim,
or you were a predator.

30:33.122 --> 30:35.667
When you're at work,
and people are talking,

30:35.750 --> 30:39.546
they say a lot of crazy things
just to spike your interest.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.549
At Blue Cross and Blue Shield,

30:42.632 --> 30:45.218
Richard was, like,
the dark side of the talking.

30:47.762 --> 30:49.889
One of the, uh, stories Richard told

30:50.765 --> 30:53.476
was about The Hellfire Club.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.312
It was a sex club,

30:57.772 --> 31:03.027
and Richie talked about this master
and slave act that was going on there.

31:09.242 --> 31:13.204
He said this guy was dragging
this woman around on the… on the floor.

31:15.081 --> 31:18.042
There was some pain given to women.

31:18.543 --> 31:22.213
Sticking pins in them,
in the woman's breast.

31:23.339 --> 31:26.467
And he told me that really turned him on.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.053
I said, "That turned you on?"

31:29.137 --> 31:29.971
He says, "Yep."

31:35.393 --> 31:38.646
He was into, uh, sadomasochism.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.191
He was into that stuff,

31:43.610 --> 31:44.777
that bloody stuff.

31:51.159 --> 31:55.997
The sex trade, period,
is always gonna attract a darker side…

31:58.082 --> 32:02.128
and the Deuce
started getting grittier and grittier.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.507
The girls faced a lot of violence

32:06.591 --> 32:08.676
because the cops
weren't stopping anything.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.346
It was just, you know,

32:12.347 --> 32:14.515
as they would put it,
"The scum getting rid of the scum."

32:16.601 --> 32:18.186
Nobody really gave a shit.

32:18.895 --> 32:21.064
It was like
they were ready for Times Square

32:21.147 --> 32:23.149
to fold under the pressure anyway.

32:25.860 --> 32:27.779
Ask any patrolman
in this area,

32:27.862 --> 32:30.657
either in the subways or on the street.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.993
He'll tell you 42nd Street and 8th Avenue

32:34.077 --> 32:36.371
is a frightening place day or night.

32:37.622 --> 32:43.127
The difficulty was because
of the fiscal crisis in the 1970s.

32:44.504 --> 32:50.343
The city laid off 5,000 police officers,
took them off the streets,

32:51.594 --> 32:54.806
so crime went out of control.

33:01.854 --> 33:06.818
New York City,
the state it was in was real shitty.

33:07.902 --> 33:10.780
It's the only way
I can describe 42nd Street…

33:10.863 --> 33:11.906
I got shot.

33:11.990 --> 33:15.118
…all the crime that surrounds the area.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.789
With the sex-related businesses

33:19.872 --> 33:21.624
and the problems that it's caused

33:21.708 --> 33:25.420
the residential community,
it feels that it is in a state of siege.

33:25.503 --> 33:28.840
We're being threatened,
we're being harassed,

33:28.923 --> 33:30.091
and we're being chased.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.051
And I think something has to be done.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.513
A group of police officers
came out with this pamphlet,

33:35.596 --> 33:37.098
"Welcome to Fear City,"

33:37.181 --> 33:38.641
with a reaper on the front.

33:40.268 --> 33:43.771
Hold on to your belongings.
Don't go here. Don't go there.

33:45.148 --> 33:50.778
It was a guide
to how not to get killed or victimized

33:50.862 --> 33:53.740
in New York City,
especially in Times Square.

33:55.616 --> 33:56.868
The fears were real.

34:00.538 --> 34:01.789
I have children.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.709
I wanna be able
to walk down the street without fear

34:04.792 --> 34:06.794
and with… and without being exposed

34:06.878 --> 34:10.006
to what we've been seeing every day,
every day, every night.

34:10.089 --> 34:13.968
Smut must go!
Smut must go!

34:14.052 --> 34:18.097
The city decides that the Deuce
and that whole area

34:18.181 --> 34:21.434
is too much crime, too much public sex,

34:21.517 --> 34:23.770
and that they need to crack down.

34:24.395 --> 34:29.067
That's when it all started,
saving New York from itself.

34:30.193 --> 34:34.197
Then they created
the Office of Midtown Enforcement.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.616
Uh, we can't overemphasize

34:36.699 --> 34:40.453
this is not going to be
a glossed over, one-shot thing.

34:40.536 --> 34:44.082
And we're gonna be at it as rough
and as tough as we can possibly be.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.876
<i>The man directly in charge</i>
<i>of the cleanup of vice</i>

34:46.959 --> 34:48.336
<i>in the Times Square area</i>

34:48.419 --> 34:51.005
<i>is Sidney Baumgarten,</i>
<i>an assistant to the mayor,</i>

34:51.089 --> 34:53.216
<i>who'll have a full-time staff of 14</i>

34:53.299 --> 34:58.221
<i>and $432,000 of federal money</i>
<i>to do the job right.</i>

34:59.097 --> 35:03.893
We had identified
450 illicit establishments.

35:05.019 --> 35:09.398
Massage parlors,
topless, bottomless bars, drug dens,

35:09.482 --> 35:12.318
all the illegal activities
that were going on.

35:13.277 --> 35:16.906
<i>Baumgarten's attack</i>
<i>on the porno and prostitution problems</i>

35:16.989 --> 35:19.867
<i>will be aimed at catching the people</i>
<i>involved in those businesses</i>

35:19.951 --> 35:22.036
<i>violating new laws he hopes to get,</i>

35:22.120 --> 35:26.457
<i>as well as electrical, building, health,</i>
<i>and zoning codes already on the books.</i>

35:27.917 --> 35:30.503
We needed a mechanism to shut them down.

35:32.922 --> 35:36.843
We had a variety
of reasons why these places were illegal.

35:37.885 --> 35:39.387
You'd find the massage parlor

35:39.470 --> 35:42.306
had hooked up its electric
to the next-door neighbor.

35:42.390 --> 35:46.060
So the ConEd people would come down,
they would disconnect it,

35:46.727 --> 35:49.981
and they'd be in the dark,
so they'd light candles.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.442
The fire department
would go in and close them up

35:53.526 --> 35:55.778
because they didn't have
an open flame permit.

35:56.445 --> 35:59.198
We're using whatever means
we have at our disposal

35:59.282 --> 36:01.909
that are legal and proper
to close the premises down.

36:06.247 --> 36:10.585
We would see the orange sticker
from the mayor's Midtown Enforcement

36:10.668 --> 36:13.379
closing a place, one after another.

36:18.384 --> 36:20.553
I think that it's such nonsense.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.513
What is going on today is such nonsense<i>,</i>

36:22.597 --> 36:24.557
and all… all the money that's being spent…

36:24.640 --> 36:26.475
We'll look back at it
as we look back today

36:26.559 --> 36:30.438
on what Massachusetts did
to the witches up there in those days.

36:31.814 --> 36:36.485
A lot of the politicians
were going after my father,

36:37.904 --> 36:42.033
and he was becoming
like public enemy number one.

36:42.116 --> 36:45.620
My father had a friend
in the police department say,

36:45.703 --> 36:46.579
"They want you."

36:47.163 --> 36:52.001
They wanted to catch
the porno king of New York City

36:52.084 --> 36:55.004
to show that they cleaned up porn.

36:55.087 --> 36:58.633
He was arrested 12 times and got off.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.428
And then eventually, my dad went to jail.

37:03.137 --> 37:05.223
They got him on tax evasion.

37:10.061 --> 37:14.315
My arrest record runs eight times
for doing the live shows.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.610
But the streetwalkers,
that was a different level.

37:18.110 --> 37:20.112
Those arrests were a lot more frequent.

37:22.156 --> 37:27.078
It's easier
to arrest women than to, you know,

37:27.161 --> 37:28.704
hunt a serial killer,

37:28.788 --> 37:29.914
to stop muggings,

37:29.997 --> 37:31.916
to do all these other kinds of things.

37:32.750 --> 37:36.587
And so, people in the sex industry

37:36.671 --> 37:40.424
become the victims
of police public relations

37:40.508 --> 37:44.011
to make it look like the cops
were being tough on crime.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.722
It's, uh, a never-ending war.

37:46.806 --> 37:49.976
It's not like World War I,
when it's over, it's over.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.811
It's always there to be fought.

37:53.187 --> 37:58.359
<i>Mayor Beame noted the city</i>
<i>has shut down 173 sex-related businesses.</i>

37:58.442 --> 38:00.611
<i>Many others are still flourishing, though,</i>

38:00.695 --> 38:03.030
<i>right in the open</i>
<i>in the shadow of Times Square.</i>

38:03.864 --> 38:06.701
There were times when
we closed a place down,

38:06.784 --> 38:09.370
and then a month later, it was reopened.

38:09.996 --> 38:11.580
That happened too often.

38:13.499 --> 38:17.461
The desire
for deviant behavior is… is insatiable.

38:18.337 --> 38:20.172
Once you permit one level,

38:20.256 --> 38:22.258
then people go to the next level.

38:22.341 --> 38:25.469
And if you permit that,
they go to the level beyond that.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.598
Where do you stop?

38:30.266 --> 38:31.684
Where do you stop?

38:37.940 --> 38:41.527
Basically,
Richard's big thing was adventure.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.363
Always an adventure.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.660
One morning at Blue Cross and Blue Shield,

38:50.703 --> 38:53.039
Richard and I were sitting at the console,

38:53.539 --> 38:56.834
and Cottingham was in his chair,
rocking away, shaking his leg.

38:57.793 --> 38:59.337
He was a leg shaker.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.422
That drove me nuts.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.634
He was talking about
taking girls from New York,

39:05.718 --> 39:07.970
bringing them to this hotel in Jersey,

39:08.804 --> 39:10.806
and drew this complete diagram

39:11.599 --> 39:13.392
of the Quality Inn hotel.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.228
The entrances, the exits,

39:16.312 --> 39:18.647
the easy ways in, and the easy ways out.

39:19.732 --> 39:22.818
He told me he would go there with a date

39:23.527 --> 39:25.988
and then slip out whenever he wanted to

39:26.072 --> 39:28.074
and leave the girl completely undressed,

39:28.157 --> 39:31.535
no money, and nowhere to go
because she had nothing.

39:32.453 --> 39:36.415
According to other guys in the office,
Richard said that he would drug them.

39:37.750 --> 39:41.545
And you know when he said it,
you think you would say to yourself,

39:41.629 --> 39:44.382
"What a sick son of a bitch this guy is."

39:45.216 --> 39:47.176
But you don't
because you don't believe half of it.

39:47.259 --> 39:49.053
It goes in one ear and out the other.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.766
You know, we took it with a grain of salt.

39:57.770 --> 40:00.731
I don't know when
he had time to be with his family

40:00.815 --> 40:03.150
'cause he was always out
at night prowling.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.778
The guy never slept.

40:08.030 --> 40:10.783
His wife eventually found out

40:10.866 --> 40:13.828
that her husband
was going to places in New York

40:14.703 --> 40:16.330
to buy sex.

40:17.873 --> 40:22.461
And finally, she, uh,
she filed, uh, filed for divorce.

40:24.755 --> 40:27.466
His life seemed
to be unraveling.

40:31.178 --> 40:33.180


40:34.974 --> 40:37.852
The detectives
in different police jurisdictions

40:39.228 --> 40:41.147
in New Jersey, in New York,

40:42.815 --> 40:44.275
they can't find the guy,

40:45.943 --> 40:47.194
and then it went nowhere.

40:48.195 --> 40:50.948
There was nothing more
they could find out.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.829
So now it's 18 days

40:56.912 --> 41:00.624
after the murder
of Valerie Street in New Jersey

41:01.750 --> 41:06.172
and seven days
after the Jean Reyner murder in New York.

41:06.755 --> 41:11.385
And now… another girl is in danger.

41:15.556 --> 41:18.601
Leslie O'Dell
was a 19-year-old girl.

41:19.560 --> 41:22.480
She had come into town
through the Port Authority building.

41:23.814 --> 41:27.526
There are so many
runaway kids at this time

41:27.610 --> 41:31.030
who were showing up
at Port Authority on a bus

41:31.113 --> 41:33.782
trying to figure out how to survive.

41:33.866 --> 41:37.995
And there were a lot of men
who were looking to exploit them

41:38.078 --> 41:40.414
by turning them into sex workers.

41:42.458 --> 41:45.127
When she got there,
she was probably hungry,

41:45.211 --> 41:47.213
had a couple bucks in a big city.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.799
Next thing you know, this pimp says,

41:50.883 --> 41:53.677
"What's a girl like you doing
on the street? I can help you."

41:53.761 --> 41:54.595
She went for it.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.974
She was immediately snapped up
and put on the street.

41:59.725 --> 42:02.436
She was only out there a few days,
and she was trapped.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.648
She… she knew she was in a bad situation.

42:08.651 --> 42:13.239
Leslie Ann O'Dell
was approached in Manhattan by the john.

42:14.156 --> 42:15.866
And he had a lot of money.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.827
He was waving
a lot of money, uh, in front of her.

42:18.911 --> 42:23.123
This individual
had asked her to come with him,

42:24.083 --> 42:25.084
and she did.

42:28.504 --> 42:32.091
At a bar,
he came across very friendly,

42:32.174 --> 42:33.801
and he said his name was Tommy.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.721
He, uh, bought her drinks.

42:39.181 --> 42:41.100
He showed interest in her.

42:42.017 --> 42:44.144
She said she wanted
to get away from the pimp.

42:44.228 --> 42:47.273
He said, "I can help you out.
I'll give you money. You can go home."

42:47.356 --> 42:49.650
"I'm gonna help
you out of your situation."

42:49.733 --> 42:53.279
He promised her if he…
if she did go with him

42:53.362 --> 42:58.701
that he would get her safely
to a bus station in New Jersey

42:58.784 --> 43:02.413
so that she could make her escape,
uh, from her pimp.

43:04.206 --> 43:06.625
She felt very comfortable
with this man.

43:07.376 --> 43:09.128
She trusted him,

43:09.211 --> 43:12.590
so she got in the car with him willingly

43:13.716 --> 43:15.342
and drove to New Jersey.

43:18.679 --> 43:20.180
And then he said,

43:20.264 --> 43:22.308
"I'd like to have sex
with you before you go,"

43:22.391 --> 43:25.686
and he took her to the Quality Inn motel.

43:35.404 --> 43:37.906
He wanted to put her in handcuffs,

43:39.700 --> 43:41.744
that he wanted to spank her.

43:43.412 --> 43:45.372
That's when the horror began.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.125
Next thing you know, he's attacking her.

43:48.709 --> 43:51.837
She was beaten, tortured,

43:51.920 --> 43:53.839
sexually assaulted,

43:55.424 --> 43:57.926
on and on for hours.

44:09.438 --> 44:13.359
And finally,
he removed the handcuffs…

44:16.528 --> 44:18.322
…and pointed a gun at her.

44:24.119 --> 44:26.038
She knew she had to get out.

44:32.503 --> 44:35.214
She grabs the pistol, points it at him…

44:37.299 --> 44:38.550
pulls the trigger.

44:41.387 --> 44:43.097
The trigger goes "click."

44:45.724 --> 44:48.310
It's not a real pistol.
It's a fake pistol.

44:48.894 --> 44:51.438
-Now he's coming at her with a knife.

44:51.522 --> 44:54.733
-A maid hears muffled screams.

44:54.817 --> 44:58.654
The maid
is already frightened and horrified

44:58.737 --> 45:01.865
by the earlier homicide
of Valerie Ann Street.

45:03.325 --> 45:06.412
-They send somebody to the door.

45:06.495 --> 45:08.580
And they said, "Is everything all right?"

45:09.415 --> 45:11.375
Leslie went to the door…

45:12.584 --> 45:16.046
…and he warned her
to tell them that she was okay.

45:18.340 --> 45:22.386
She managed to get the door open
just a… a wee bit enough

45:23.470 --> 45:26.473
to make some kind of a hand signal.
