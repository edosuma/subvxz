00:06.673 --> 00:09.904
Okay, Eric.
Get a good look at me in my uniform.

00:09.976 --> 00:12.501
Because today-
It's my last day wearing it.

00:12.579 --> 00:15.514
What? No. No!

00:15.582 --> 00:20.576
Ah! We never got to do
the trampoline thing.

00:20.653 --> 00:22.746
Hey, I'm done with Catholic school.

00:22.822 --> 00:26.223
And my dad fixed it so I can graduate
at Point Place with you guys.

00:26.292 --> 00:28.419
My best memories
are under that skirt.

00:30.497 --> 00:33.796
Hey, Mom? Where's Daddy?
I need $20.

00:35.435 --> 00:38.893
- For what?
- In an effort to clean up my act...

00:38.972 --> 00:41.532
I'm buying my own drinks now.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.175
Well, he's not home.

00:46.246 --> 00:49.977
When Eric told him about his little plan
to move away with Donna after graduation...

00:50.050 --> 00:51.984
your father went <i>fishing.</i>

00:52.052 --> 00:54.782
- What?
- No!

00:56.189 --> 00:59.784
What the big deal?
You guys are really freakin' me out.

00:59.859 --> 01:04.296
My dad only goes fishing
when he's, like, super-pissed.

01:04.364 --> 01:08.824
I think something about stabbing a worm
over and over again with a hook is, like...

01:09.903 --> 01:12.201
um, therapeutic for him.

01:12.272 --> 01:17.471
Yeah. He fished for three whole days
when he found out about me and the mayor.

01:19.212 --> 01:22.079
- What?
- Eric's moving away!

01:23.750 --> 01:26.014
That's right.
And that's why your father's angry.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.384
This is your way of acting grown up?

01:28.455 --> 01:32.221
Grown-ups don't just leave
the comfort of their parents' home to-

01:32.292 --> 01:35.455
to move to a new city
and start a life?

01:36.763 --> 01:38.890
Well, maybe not in the 1930s-

01:40.133 --> 01:41.566
'40s-

01:42.702 --> 01:45.034
God, you're so young.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.199
Well, I think this is nuts.
Don't you just think this is nuts?

01:48.274 --> 01:51.732
- The whole thing is just-just nuts!
- [Utensils Clattering]

01:55.949 --> 01:58.941
Mom, I kinda think
you're the one who's being-

01:59.018 --> 02:03.114
Oh, if you say I'm nuts, you're going
right through that sliding door.

02:04.991 --> 02:07.687
I don't enjoy telling you this...

02:07.760 --> 02:11.457
but you just wait
until your father gets home.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.861
All right. I did enjoy that.

02:18.204 --> 02:20.263
This is all your fault.

02:20.340 --> 02:23.104
Yeah.
Hey, Laurie, uh, quick impression:

02:23.176 --> 02:26.441
Who am I? "Hey, Eric, why don't you tell Dad
you're moving after graduation...

02:26.513 --> 02:30.347
so he'll kill you and I can reclaim
my rightful place as the chosen one?"

02:30.416 --> 02:32.441
[Mouths Word]

02:32.519 --> 02:36.387
Eric, you don't understand.
This time I actually meant well.

02:36.456 --> 02:40.017
That's what you said at the county fair after
you locked me in the Porta-Potty with a goat.

02:42.295 --> 02:44.991
- He was friendly.
- He was horny!

02:47.834 --> 02:50.166
- Hey, Jackie.
- [Groans]

02:50.236 --> 02:55.230
- Michael, what do you want?
- I think the question is, what do <i>you</i> want?

02:55.308 --> 03:00.405
And I'm pretty sure
the answer is pink jelly beans.

03:02.448 --> 03:06.544
Now, they used to be pink and white
jelly beans, but I ate all the white ones...

03:06.619 --> 03:09.417
'cause I know you don't like things
that taste white.

03:11.891 --> 03:16.954
Okay. Look. Michael, just because
Steven and I broke up...

03:17.030 --> 03:19.658
does not mean I want you
throwing yourself at me.

03:19.732 --> 03:24.635
Whoa. Jackie,
this is the new and improved Michael.

03:24.704 --> 03:30.165
Okay? I'm not throwing anything at you
except for happy thoughts and jelly beans.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.768
Like, sex is, like,
the furthest thing from my mind.

03:35.982 --> 03:38.576
So-
[Sighs]

03:38.651 --> 03:41.381
It's really over
between you two, huh?

03:41.454 --> 03:44.685
Yeah. Yeah, I think it is.

03:44.757 --> 03:48.955
- So why do we still have clothes on?
- Oh, God. Michael, get out!

03:49.028 --> 03:53.931
Oh, Jackie, I'm talking about
our emotional clothes.

03:55.501 --> 03:58.595
Okay, look, I know I've made mistakes
in the past, okay?

03:58.671 --> 04:02.334
But I've changed, and I just want you
to get to know the new me.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.775
Yeah, the new you, huh?
What does the new you cheat with-

04:05.845 --> 04:10.282
every skank who throws her fat,
furry butt at you?

04:10.350 --> 04:16.289
Jackie, no one I ever cheated with
had a fat, furry butt!

04:16.356 --> 04:18.654
If anything,
it was one or the other.

- Well, it's the truth.

Okay. Fine. Michael, whatever.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.902
- Okay? Let's just see how things go from here.
- Great. Let's get naked.

04:33.973 --> 04:38.706
- Oh! Michael!
- No, like, friendly naked- like two girls in a sauna.

[Chuckling]
You are such a freak.

04:42.915 --> 04:47.648

I bought 'em just for you.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.654

I have to get Lindsay Wolfe

06:19.545 --> 06:23.845
then show her that she's actually signed
a pledge to do it with me three times.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.713
Why three?

06:25.785 --> 06:29.414
Well, because the first time
I'll be nervous...

- Yeah, well, you should, because they were pink...

07:40.159 --> 07:43.185
and that is the bean of love.

07:43.262 --> 07:46.663
And I got her that particular bean
because I never stopped loving her.

07:46.732 --> 07:50.668
Yeah, well, you stopped long enough to cheat
on her with Pam Macy, Laurie and Annette.

07:50.736 --> 07:54.502
- Who else am I forgetting?
- [Chortles] There were many others.

07:54.574 --> 07:56.838
But you cheated on her with a nurse.

07:56.909 --> 07:59.878

that you caused.

- That's it. Let's go.
- Oh, yeah? I'm ready.

08:01.547 --> 08:04.209
I hope you got that nurse's number.
You're gonna need it when I'm done.

- Fine. I'll be over here.

08:17.864 --> 08:21.322
Well, since I have never seen another man's
genitals, I'll have to paint my own.

08:23.402 --> 08:26.371
In that case, I'll need more paint.

14:37.849 --> 14:40.181
No, I'm serious.
Door's open for you.

14:40.252 --> 14:42.846
No, <i>I'm</i> serious.
The door is open for you.

14:42.921 --> 14:46.652
- I just closed the door for me!
- Well, I'm closin' the door for me...

14:46.725 --> 14:51.025
and I'm lockin' myself inside,
and I'm swallowin' the key!

14:52.664 --> 14:55.792
Fine. We're both done with her.
You're my bud.

14:55.867 --> 14:58.165
You're <i>my</i> bud.
Aah!

15:00.238 --> 15:04.231
I was wondering if that would work,
and it did.

15:05.344 --> 15:08.370
- [Gasps] Steven! Are you okay?
- Why?

15:08.447 --> 15:12.042
Well, I heard someone fell off the water tower,
and I thought it could be you. L-

15:12.117 --> 15:15.086
- No, it was Kelso.
- [Exhales]

15:15.153 --> 15:20.022
Wait. You came down here,
'cause you were worried about me.

15:20.092 --> 15:22.026
No, I didn't.

15:23.095 --> 15:25.620
'Cause you still care about me.

15:25.697 --> 15:28.928
Uh-uh.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.664
- So I still have a shot with you.
- No. No, you don't.

15:33.739 --> 15:36.435
I mean, okay. I don't know.

15:38.777 --> 15:41.268
Steven, stop staring at me,
or I'll kick you.

15:43.582 --> 15:45.573
Ah!

15:49.888 --> 15:54.450
Jackie, hope you didn't come here
to make love to me.

15:59.398 --> 16:02.697
- No, Michael. L-
- 'Cause I'm fine.

16:02.768 --> 16:05.464
All I need is my buddy Hyde.

16:09.741 --> 16:13.142
And no chick
is gonna come between us anymore.

16:13.211 --> 16:17.272
- Right, Hyde?
- Uh-h-h, yeah.

16:17.349 --> 16:21.376
Yeah. Let's go, buddy Hyde.
Aah!

16:25.390 --> 16:28.518
Look at all the apartments
they have in Madison.

16:28.593 --> 16:34.395
- This place even pays utilities.
- Oh, cool.

16:34.466 --> 16:36.934
What are utilities?

16:38.904 --> 16:42.465
- I think it's, like, gas and water.
- Free water?

16:42.541 --> 16:45.009
Um, you know what that means?

16:45.076 --> 16:47.237
Free ice.

16:47.312 --> 16:49.610
What are you two doing?

16:49.681 --> 16:52.377
Oh, we're lookin'
for apartments in Madison.

16:52.451 --> 16:54.919
I can't believe it.
It's like we leave in less than a week.

16:54.986 --> 16:59.821
Are you trying to kill me?
Because that's what you're doing.

16:59.891 --> 17:02.325
You're killing your mother.
You only get one, ya know.

17:02.394 --> 17:05.521
Eric, this place
has a washer and dryer.

17:05.597 --> 17:10.090
Wait. A washer <i>and</i> free water?

17:10.167 --> 17:12.897
- Oh, my God, it's like there's no reason
to ever come home.
- I know.

17:12.971 --> 17:16.702
[Laughs, Stops]
Excuse me.

17:19.310 --> 17:23.509
Washer and dryer, Red.
They are going to have a washer and dryer.

17:23.582 --> 17:28.747
That redheaded harlot is gonna be
Shouting out my baby's grass stains!

17:30.689 --> 17:33.123
What about <i>my</i> last summer
with my youngest child?

17:33.191 --> 17:36.024
I bet you weren't thinkin' about that
when you went fishing.

17:36.094 --> 17:40.121
I bought sparklers for the Fourth ofJuly.
He loves sparklers...

17:40.198 --> 17:44.328
and now he's leaving,
and what are we gonna do for the Fourth ofJuly?

17:46.838 --> 17:49.466
Uh-h-h,
there's a car show in Kenosha.

17:49.541 --> 17:52.339
A car show?

17:52.410 --> 17:55.573
I don't want to go to a- [Bleeps] car show
in- [Bleeps] Kenosha.

17:55.647 --> 17:59.708
I want three more- [Bleeps] months
with my baby boy...

17:59.784 --> 18:02.014
and now they're gone
because of your bull- [Bleeps]

18:02.087 --> 18:05.079
Way to go, dumb-ass!

18:14.900 --> 18:17.960
Ah, it feels good to be back!

18:18.036 --> 18:23.133
Just Kelso and Hyde. No chick can come
between us. All right. So what do ya wanna do?

18:23.208 --> 18:26.871
We can play air hockey,
give Fez a wedgie, uh-

18:26.945 --> 18:30.711
Oh, my brother just got a new stereo.
We can throw it off an overpass.

18:30.782 --> 18:34.411
Actually, I changed my mind.
I'm gonna getJackie back.

18:34.486 --> 18:37.148
What? No way.
What about our third-grade pact?

18:37.222 --> 18:40.714
We also made a pact to invent
a formula for invisibility.

18:44.596 --> 18:49.260
- Well, that fell through too.
- Well, because you gave up.

18:52.337 --> 18:54.999
Look, Kelso. I never felt this way
about a girl before, okay?

18:55.073 --> 18:58.839
And that pretty much beats our third-grade pact.
I'm sorry, but I wanna be with her.

18:58.910 --> 19:01.640
Well, at the hospital,
you said that I could have her.

19:01.713 --> 19:04.807
That was when I didn't think
I still had a shot with her.

19:04.883 --> 19:07.852
Your- For your information,
I still have a shot with her.

19:07.919 --> 19:11.616
She accepted my jelly beans.

19:11.690 --> 19:15.251
I don't know what that means,
but you can't have her. You closed the door.

19:15.327 --> 19:20.060
Yeah? Well, now I'm closin' the door on you,
and once again, I'm swallowin' the key.

19:20.131 --> 19:23.794
And you're locked inside,
and I'm gettin'Jackie back.

19:25.170 --> 19:28.765
Well, you're gonna lose.
Heh-heh.

19:28.840 --> 19:32.173
Yeah? Well, if by "lose" you mean "win,"
then you're right.

19:32.243 --> 19:35.303
I am gonna lose.
[Chortles]

19:41.886 --> 19:46.414
Well, thanks a lot for getting me
at the police station, you two sons of two bitches!

19:56.001 --> 19:58.231
Fez, what happened?

19:58.303 --> 20:01.534
Well, I got arrested.
And they did a background check...

20:01.606 --> 20:04.700
and found out that my student visa
expires when I graduate from high school.

20:04.776 --> 20:07.711
- What?
- Yeah, and now I have to leave the country
after graduation.

20:07.779 --> 20:12.580
That's in a week.
And I have to relearn my native language.

20:17.489 --> 20:19.423
- Good day.
- No, but Fez-

20:19.491 --> 20:22.085
[Speaking Foreign Language]

20:29.668 --> 20:32.660
Way to go. If you hadn't fallen off the water tower,
we could've helped him out.

20:32.737 --> 20:34.671
Aah!

20:34.739 --> 20:36.798
Aa-aa-aah!

20:36.875 --> 20:39.400
They should've x-rayed your head
at the hospital.

20:39.477 --> 20:41.240
They did.

20:43.882 --> 20:46.578
And for your information,
they found nothing.

20:46.651 --> 20:48.642
Hmm.

20:51.990 --> 20:55.118
I can't believe our little Fez
is gonna be deported.

20:56.294 --> 20:58.524
God, I wish there was
something we could do.

20:58.596 --> 21:01.622
Maybe I could talk to the mayor.
He owes me one.

21:03.001 --> 21:04.935
Eric, we can't let this happen.

21:05.003 --> 21:07.597
If Fez goes back to his country
with those pictures he took...

21:07.672 --> 21:09.606
my panties are gonna
end up on a stamp.

21:13.478 --> 21:16.140
Pop-Tarts?
Where's Mom?

21:16.214 --> 21:18.705
She went fishin'.
Shut up and eat.

21:25.523 --> 21:28.788
Dear PresidentJimmy Carter.
The following is a list of reasons...

21:28.860 --> 21:31.761
why I, Fez, should be allowed to stay
in your great country.

21:31.830 --> 21:35.493
Number one: I have never
gone number one on your beautiful soil.

21:35.567 --> 21:39.025
Number two: I have never
gone number two on your-

21:39.104 --> 21:41.664
Wait. Scratch that.

21:41.740 --> 21:45.733
Number two: "Fez" is also a word for a hat.
Uncle Sam wears a hat.

21:45.810 --> 21:49.075
Coincidence?
[Chuckles] Yes.

21:49.147 --> 21:52.207
Three, where else am I going to live? France?
[Scoffs]

21:52.283 --> 21:54.478
[Bleeps] France.
