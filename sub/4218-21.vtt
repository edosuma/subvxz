WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:03.419
Kill the torch!

00:04.380 --> 00:05.505
Previously on
Chicago Fire...

00:05.673 --> 00:06.964
How are the classes going?

00:07.132 --> 00:08.758
I couldn't get into
Vertical Rescue.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.843
Call Lieutenant Brunson,
tell him I want you
in his class.

00:11.762 --> 00:12.970
I feel like I'm doing
something wrong.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.555
I see the way
that people look at me.

00:14.723 --> 00:17.892
You just have to remind
yourself that you're not
doing it for them.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.018
Curtis.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.937
This is the guy
who helped Antonio
bust Voight.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.942
According to Boden,
the DA's office remains

00:26.110 --> 00:28.486
committed to its case
against Detective Voight.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.822
This conversation
becomes about favors.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.658
Uh, sorry,
we're closed.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.788
Hey, Matt.
Hallie?

00:38.956 --> 00:40.748
When I told her I was
gonna be working at 51

00:40.916 --> 00:42.333
she warned me about you.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.502
She said that
you were just my type.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.755
A subordinate has
accused you of luring her
to your apartment

00:47.923 --> 00:49.924
and trying to
force yourself upon her.

00:50.092 --> 00:51.342
What did she say
that I did?

00:51.510 --> 00:53.094
You're gonna want to see
about getting a lawyer.

00:54.596 --> 00:55.680
How long was she
in your apartment?

00:55.848 --> 00:57.974
Half hour.
Hour, tops.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.392
And how many beers
did you have?

01:01.103 --> 01:02.520
Two.
In 30 minutes?

01:02.688 --> 01:03.980
First time in history
anyone's ever drank

01:04.148 --> 01:05.648
two beers in
half an hour?

01:05.816 --> 01:08.818
Ms. Little stated
that it was hard
to keep up with you.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.570
She felt buzzed.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.572
That's what happens
when you drink beer.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.574
She'd know since she
brought the six-pack over.

01:16.535 --> 01:17.744
She said
you tried to kiss her,

01:17.911 --> 01:20.413
but she was uncomfortable
and tried to leave.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.874
You backed her
against the wall,
leaned into her body

01:23.041 --> 01:25.084
and put your hand
on her buttock.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.295
Unreal.
Care to respond?

01:27.463 --> 01:29.589
Lieutenant Severide is
not obligated to respond

01:29.757 --> 01:31.883
to any of these
questions, Commander.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.177
He came in good faith
to hear the charges
against him.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.181
Actually, I faked
a yawn and said
I was tired

01:38.348 --> 01:40.016
and she should
probably get going.

01:40.184 --> 01:41.976
Because I started thinking
she was a little...

01:42.978 --> 01:44.187
...desperate.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.442
You're up, Voight.

02:01.413 --> 02:02.830
How's Dawson?

02:02.998 --> 02:04.832
Good. Great.

02:05.876 --> 02:06.959
Why?

02:08.462 --> 02:09.712
Don't even pretend.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.590
Um, she's dating
young Peter Mills.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.093
That sneaky
little bastard.
Good for him.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.890
How about yourself?
Seeing anybody?

02:21.058 --> 02:22.308
Nah, no one serious.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.524
You heard about
Curtis, right?

02:29.691 --> 02:31.234
Yeah. Um...

02:32.277 --> 02:33.528
Was Voight behind it?

02:33.695 --> 02:34.862
I have no idea.

02:35.030 --> 02:37.824
I mean, the kid
was in a gang,
but still...

02:37.991 --> 02:40.576
That doesn't make
any difference in terms
of Voight's case, right?

02:40.744 --> 02:42.620
Apparently there's
a dismissal hearing today,

02:42.788 --> 02:45.915
and his union is
pushing hard
for entrapment.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.379
All I know is
I can't get sucked
into it again.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.600
I'm hungry.

03:06.144 --> 03:06.978
Let's go.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.857
Drink coupons?

03:11.024 --> 03:12.692
It's called
a "loss leader,"
okay?

03:12.860 --> 03:13.860
It gets people
in the door,

03:14.027 --> 03:15.862
once they're inside,
they keep spending.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.656
I'm already
confused, all right?

03:18.824 --> 03:21.284
It's a bar,
not the New York
Stock Exchange.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.327
It's actually not that
complicated, Herrmann.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.329
Well, we have
a soft opening
in a week,

03:25.497 --> 03:27.206
and we don't even have
our decorations up yet.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.458
Call it
a drink special.
I don't care.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.131
Oh, marry him.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.176
Okay, everybody,
listen up.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.054
In light of
recent events,

03:43.557 --> 03:45.182
recent allegations,
rather,

03:46.059 --> 03:47.977
Personnel Division
has flagged this house

03:48.145 --> 03:50.771
for sexual harassment
sensitivity training.

03:50.939 --> 03:51.898
Uh, Chief?

03:52.065 --> 03:53.816
I think actually it's
sexual harassment

03:53.984 --> 03:55.067
and sensitivity training.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.402
'Cause the way
that you just said it,

03:56.570 --> 03:58.446
it makes it sound like
we have to be sensitive

03:58.614 --> 04:00.031
toward sexual...

04:11.043 --> 04:12.543
All right,
what the hell?
This house needs it.

04:12.711 --> 04:13.794
All right,
listen up, everybody.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.463
CFD special, okay?

04:15.631 --> 04:17.632
Happy hour prices
all night long

04:17.799 --> 04:19.050
when Molly's opens.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.227
Lieutenant.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.355
What you're going
through ain't right.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.649
So if there's anything
I can do to help,
name it.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.984
I mean, if you just
want to grab a beer

04:37.152 --> 04:38.402
or put on some gloves...

04:38.570 --> 04:39.654
Appreciate it.

04:44.826 --> 04:45.701
Hey, Mills.

04:48.830 --> 04:49.914
His shoes need shining.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.628
Truck 81,
Squad 3.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.922
Engine 51.
Ambulance 61.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.508
Car accident.
3464 Morgan Street.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.802
Casey, I just heard from
the state's attorney.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.053
Voight's out.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.099
All right.
Yeah.

05:12.396 --> 05:13.479
What's
the story here?

05:13.647 --> 05:15.272
We got
two people stuck.
What happened?

05:15.440 --> 05:16.899
Driver got shot
and lost control.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.610
Word is this is
the guy
that shot Curtis.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.028
Retaliation hit.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.120
Looks unstable.
Be careful.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.664
He's pinned in.
Foot's stuck
on the gas.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.250
Oh, God!
Oh, God,
help me, please!

05:44.845 --> 05:45.928
Hey! Stand clear
of the car!

05:46.096 --> 05:47.722
Second victim's
underneath!

05:47.889 --> 05:49.765
Hang on, ma'am.
We're gonna
get you out, okay?

05:49.933 --> 05:50.808
Hurry, please.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.935
Driver's got a head wound.
We've got to get him out
of there.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.021
Hey, we budge this car,
it's gonna take off.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.274
We lift the car.
Kelly, you get
the woman.

05:58.442 --> 05:59.358
We stabilize this
on the truck

05:59.526 --> 06:00.735
and get the driver
at the same time. Go.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.862
Capp, Hadley,
air bags and halligans!

06:03.030 --> 06:04.238
Cruz and Mills,

06:04.406 --> 06:06.574
we need bottle jacks
and cribbing,
as much as we have.

06:06.742 --> 06:07.992
Mouch, take
the center punch.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.827
Herrmann, Sawzall,
let's move.

06:09.995 --> 06:10.995
- Got it.
- What do we got?

06:11.163 --> 06:12.705
Looks like
a perforating
head injury.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.373
The driver's still alive.
You're gonna have to
move fast.

06:14.541 --> 06:15.583
We're on it.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.843
Okay, help me
out with this.
We got to lift it.

06:28.680 --> 06:29.972
- Don't worry, ma'am.
- We're right here with you.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.852
Don't let it
touch that wheel!

06:35.812 --> 06:36.854
Hang in there.
Hang in there.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.230
Watch your back.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.317
All right, let's get
that board in!

06:41.485 --> 06:43.444
Easy, easy.

06:45.489 --> 06:46.906
Watch it.
You got it?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.407
Keep her away
from that wheel.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.869
Good job, guys,
good job.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.010
- Pop those hinges.
- I got it.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.017
There you go!
Get the board in now.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.689
He's got a pulse.
Barely.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.817
- Watch his head.
- Okay.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.027
Watch it.
You got it?

07:25.195 --> 07:26.237
Yeah, I got it.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.409
Did I hear right?
Voight's out?

07:32.577 --> 07:33.744
Yeah.

07:35.914 --> 07:36.872
Let's go.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.961
You're not doing
what I think
you're doing, are you?

07:45.841 --> 07:47.174
What if I just meet her
face-to-face and...

07:47.342 --> 07:50.803
Do not contact
this woman,
you hear me?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.805
We have a follow-up
interview tomorrow,

07:52.973 --> 07:54.849
and we have
the upper hand
right now.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.934
Okay?

08:01.857 --> 08:03.274
Single gunshot
to the head
through and through.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.859
Entrance is
at the cheek.
Pressure?

08:05.026 --> 08:07.027
50 over 30.
Get him into six.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.410
I told you that
Tara chick was
bad news. Now look.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.163
So there's
no way that
Severide could have

08:17.330 --> 08:18.372
gotten a little
too frisky with her?

08:18.540 --> 08:20.416
Against her will?
No way.

08:20.584 --> 08:21.792
Well, what's
Severide saying?

08:22.794 --> 08:24.044
Not much.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.462
Whenever he gets
this look on his face,

08:25.630 --> 08:27.798
I just steer clear
and let him
figure it out.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.758
'Cause me trying
to fix it never
does any good.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.888
She's not gonna
get away with this,
is she?

08:34.055 --> 08:35.514
Well, that's what
they said about Voight.

08:35.682 --> 08:36.724
Ugh, crazy town.

08:36.892 --> 08:38.475
I mean, how does
that guy walk?

08:39.394 --> 08:40.477
I don't know.
It reminds me
of this joke

08:40.645 --> 08:41.729
my dad
once told me.

08:41.897 --> 08:44.356
Why is Chicago-style pizza
so thick?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.859
Why?
Don't worry
about it.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.825
She's not here.
Who?

08:54.993 --> 08:56.118
Hallie.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.369
I'm not looking
for Hallie.

09:02.709 --> 09:03.876
Who is it?
Blocked.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.712
Who blocks their phones
anymore other than
drug dealers?

09:10.759 --> 09:12.009
Nice slacks!

09:12.928 --> 09:16.222
Acceptable compliment?
Yes, no, or depends.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.807
I don't think
people call them
slacks anymore.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.476
Oh, come on, come on.
No, you know
what I mean.

09:20.644 --> 09:22.853
Pants, dungarees,
whatever.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.773
Depends.
On?

09:25.941 --> 09:28.484
What part of
the pants?
Exactly.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.361
A female coworker
is standing
in front of you...

09:30.528 --> 09:31.987
"Nice pants,"
is acceptable.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.698
Walking away from you,
no way, Jose.

09:34.866 --> 09:35.824
And why not?

09:35.992 --> 09:37.451
Isn't it kind of
obvious?

09:39.037 --> 09:42.665
Look, I know all this
new political
correctness-type deal

09:42.832 --> 09:43.999
is a head-spinner,
'cause it was

09:44.167 --> 09:45.709
a little more
loosey-goosey
back in the day.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.753
I mean, hell,
when I first started
working for the city

09:47.921 --> 09:49.713
you'd walk into
some locker rooms,

09:49.881 --> 09:51.757
they'd have Hustler
centerfolds taped up.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.135
You do that nowadays,
ninjas drop from
the ceiling

09:55.303 --> 09:57.596
and will airlift your
ass right out of there.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.640
Tell me about it.

09:59.808 --> 10:03.811
When I started
there was this guy,
Eric Weinberger,

10:03.979 --> 10:06.146
and if it was
somebody's birthday,

10:06.314 --> 10:09.900
he would walk around
with his testicles
hanging out of his fly...

10:10.068 --> 10:11.610
Okay. Okay!

10:11.778 --> 10:14.321
Look... tap
the brakes, pal.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.115
That's what I'm
talking about.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.408
Hey.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.828
Voight's got a condo
in Myrtle Beach.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.079
And there's a good shot
he threatens

10:22.247 --> 10:24.415
to sue the department
for wrongful prosecution,

10:24.582 --> 10:25.749
settles for
a chunk of change

10:25.917 --> 10:27.126
and then goes to play
golf year round.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.920
That's according to
my buddy who used to
work for Voight.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.054
He's dirty,
but he ain't stupid.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.140
He knows he dodged
a bullet on this one.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.474
And with his son
already doing a year,

10:42.642 --> 10:44.143
there's no way
he's gonna come
after you again.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.352
That's what they
told me right before

10:45.520 --> 10:47.521
he tried to have my
skull cracked open.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.481
You'll keep us
apprised, won't you,
Antonio?

10:51.401 --> 10:52.609
Of course.

10:55.947 --> 10:57.114
Casey.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.118
Do not get
drawn back into this.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.170
Leslie Shay!
Hey, Derek.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.466
What's wrong?

11:16.760 --> 11:17.885
That was Voight.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.596
What'd he say?

11:20.764 --> 11:22.306
He's calling in
that favor I owe him.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.069
You're gonna call
Voight back?

11:35.904 --> 11:37.237
I mean,
I guess I have to.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.031
Want me to?
No. No, no, no.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.409
But... that's really nice
of you to offer.

11:43.745 --> 11:44.828
You let me know.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.498
And we're cool.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.874
No matter what you do.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.752
I don't want us
going down the same road

11:51.920 --> 11:54.713
we did last time
and not talking to
each other for a month.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.048
You're too important
to me for that.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.511
Thanks.

12:00.678 --> 12:01.804
I feel the same way.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.430
Which is why I wanted
to bring you in the loop,

12:03.598 --> 12:04.890
so that you
didn't think I was

12:05.058 --> 12:07.267
scheming with Voight
or anything
behind your back.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.732
Dawson,
I'm serious though.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.734
You try to deal with
Voight on your own,

12:15.902 --> 12:17.152
you'll end up
in quicksand.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.822
Okay.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.240
Can I borrow you two
for a second?

12:25.578 --> 12:26.787
"You look very nice today."

12:27.831 --> 12:28.789
Thank you.

12:30.792 --> 12:33.377
"A bunch of us are gonna
get some beers after work.

12:33.545 --> 12:34.586
"Care to join?"

12:34.754 --> 12:36.713
Sure, yeah.
That sounds fun.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.092
Keep going, or...
Please.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.427
Okay.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.721
Oh, look, he just
groped her.
Did everybody see that?

12:44.889 --> 12:45.681
Shay.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.724
I'm just saying.
That's all
it takes, right?

12:47.892 --> 12:49.351
"Have you been
going to the gym?"

12:50.311 --> 12:52.688
Um, yeah, you know,
here and there.

12:52.856 --> 12:53.856
Not as much as I'd like.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.738
"Because your physique
looks really good."

13:02.949 --> 13:04.491
Well, thank you.
That's really nice of you.

13:04.659 --> 13:05.534
Now freeze it.
Freeze it.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.454
What did we talk about
behavioral modifiers?

13:08.621 --> 13:11.039
I think he means
stop the role-play.
Oh.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.749
Matt should not be
making comments

13:12.917 --> 13:14.168
about Gabby's body.
We know that.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.586
But Gabby should not be

13:15.753 --> 13:18.672
accepting compliments
about her body from Matt.

13:18.840 --> 13:19.882
Keep your radio on.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.679
Uh, why don't we
break for lunch?

13:27.098 --> 13:28.140
Thank you.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.851
Hey, candidate?
Yeah.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.895
You park across
the street?
Yeah, why?

13:41.237 --> 13:43.822
Oh! Son of a bitch!

13:43.990 --> 13:44.907
Oh, man.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.701
Man, right in front
of the house! God!

13:47.869 --> 13:49.786
Whoa, wait a second.
Wait a second.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.581
Isn't this an '03?
Yeah.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.709
I think this is the model
they built with
the spare window.

13:58.421 --> 13:59.588
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.798
Hang on a second.
Hold on, let me show you.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.933
Oh...

14:14.812 --> 14:16.605
Funny.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.691
Give my keys.

14:20.610 --> 14:21.735
That was a good one.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.456
I just wanted to talk,
you know.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.791
Human being
to human being.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.501
I don't want to
talk about
the other night.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.879
It's still so painful.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.340
Tara, come on.
We were both there.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.384
And if I said something
that offended you...

14:45.552 --> 14:48.011
Look, IAD is pushing me
to file a police report.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.681
And despite what happened,
I'm not interested

14:50.848 --> 14:52.474
in making this
a criminal case.

14:54.811 --> 14:55.852
For what?

14:58.815 --> 15:00.399
Look me in the eye.
Tell me what I did.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.025
But there is
another option.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.237
If you apologize
on record,

15:05.405 --> 15:07.364
it's called
an Alford plea.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.992
You won't be
admitting guilt,
but we could both

15:11.244 --> 15:13.745
avoid the embarrassment
of reliving this in public.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.166
You're crazy.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.964
I knew I shouldn't have
agreed to meet you.

15:31.556 --> 15:32.723
I'll take care of it.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.018
Look, I don't have
a problem calling him
to see what he wants.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.811
No.

15:37.979 --> 15:38.854
Hey.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.939
Don't do anything crazy.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.027
Truck 81, Engine 51,

15:45.194 --> 15:47.279
Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.531
Overturned tanker.
Eleanor and Fuller.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.591
Squad's set to pull
the driver out.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.509
We just need engine
to get some water
on this fire

16:09.677 --> 16:10.761
so we have some clearance.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.888
This first tank
is leaking
sodium hydroxide.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.598
We have an active
chemical spill.

16:14.766 --> 16:15.891
That is a negative
on the water.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.976
That's going to
spread the spill out
even further.

16:19.062 --> 16:23.357
We need to get
foam on this fire...
And masks on!

16:23.524 --> 16:25.400
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey, get me out of here!

16:25.568 --> 16:26.777
- Squad 3.
- Get me out!

16:26.944 --> 16:29.029
Suit up for rescue.
Call in Hazmat.

16:29.197 --> 16:31.948
Hang on in there!
We're gonna
come and get you!

16:32.909 --> 16:35.952
Battalion 25 to dispatch,
we need
the closest available

16:36.120 --> 16:37.788
foam engine to
Bridgeport right now.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.081
We are on
Eleanor and Fuller.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.290
Copy that, 25.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.668
Let's dyke off
this area right now.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.753
If it gets into the river,
it'll spread into Chicago.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.005
Got it. Shovels
and pick axes!

16:49.467 --> 16:50.926
Right here.
Start digging!

16:57.684 --> 16:58.767
Chief,
where's our foam?

16:58.935 --> 17:00.519
We're working on it, Casey.

17:01.771 --> 17:05.023
Chief, if you need us
to pull him out now,
we're ready.

17:06.109 --> 17:09.236
That diesel fire's
impinging on that tanker.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.863
It's getting ready
to blow! You can't
go in yet.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.994
Driver's gonna get
burned inside and out

17:18.162 --> 17:20.038
if he stays in there
much longer.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.748
Where the hell
is that engine?

17:30.967 --> 17:32.342
Severide, Capp.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.511
That foam will cover up
the vapors. You ready?

17:34.679 --> 17:35.846
Yeah, let's do it!

17:36.013 --> 17:36.763
Hadley!
Yeah!

17:36.931 --> 17:39.433
Have the descender ready
to send up the aerial.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.184
Uh, it's new.
I don't know
the set-up yet.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.353
I'll just rig up
a rope and pulley.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.273
No, that's not enough.
We're gonna need
the descender.

17:46.441 --> 17:47.733
Ask Mills to do it.

17:49.944 --> 17:50.944
On it.

17:52.905 --> 17:53.905
Let's go.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.829
Hadley, stand by.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.586
Here.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.879
Take that, run it up.

18:10.965 --> 18:11.757
Mouch.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.765
Capp, make sure
you stay tight
to Severide.

18:30.777 --> 18:31.735
Chemicals
flooding the cab.

18:31.903 --> 18:32.986
Driver's losing
consciousness.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.822
Hey, buddy,
hang in there.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.491
We're gonna
get you out!

18:37.658 --> 18:39.910
Watch your eyes!
Watch it!

18:44.749 --> 18:46.082
Capp, throw me
the rope back.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.210
It's coming down.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.134
Got the harness attached.

19:04.936 --> 19:06.561
Okay, pull him up!

19:08.481 --> 19:09.773
Pull!

19:15.446 --> 19:16.863
Keep it going!

19:19.283 --> 19:21.451
Okay, Mills,
the driver's clear.

19:21.619 --> 19:22.702
We're good!

19:22.870 --> 19:23.995
Let's go,
let's go!

19:24.997 --> 19:27.165
All right.
Bring him
over, Mouch.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.753
This way!

19:31.921 --> 19:33.004
Keep it going!
Keep it going!

19:33.172 --> 19:34.422
Keep coming!

19:39.262 --> 19:40.595
Let's go!

19:44.141 --> 19:45.141
Good job.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.319
Hope we weren't
too much of a pain
in the ass.

19:56.487 --> 19:57.571
Not at all.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.074
Fully aware that you work
24-hour shifts together

20:01.242 --> 20:03.702
and you see the things
that you see.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.121
And there should be
consideration for that.

20:06.289 --> 20:09.624
You just have to be careful
or you can find yourself
in a real predicament.

20:09.792 --> 20:10.959
Did everybody hear that?

20:11.127 --> 20:12.085
We got it.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.880
Still using the Elkhart
brass nozzles, I see.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.008
Is that a 75/100?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.886
Yeah, how you know
about nozzles?

20:21.053 --> 20:23.680
Ah, I took
the CFD exam.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.432
Back when dinosaurs
roamed the earth.

20:26.434 --> 20:27.767
Made it
all the way through,

20:27.935 --> 20:29.477
then got dinged on
the last day.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.022
What happened?
Color blind.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.319
What are you gonna do?
It all worked out.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.447
Eh! You know what's
gonna work out
on my end?

20:40.615 --> 20:41.907
Molly's bar.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.075
This thing
takes off

20:44.243 --> 20:45.493
we're gonna brand it,

20:45.661 --> 20:46.661
Franchise it.

20:46.829 --> 20:49.039
We're gonna have
Molly's Kansas City,

20:49.206 --> 20:50.582
Molly's Des Moines...

20:50.750 --> 20:53.209
Easy, tiger.
Let's get this one
off the ground first.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.177
Who put dog food
in here?

21:05.723 --> 21:08.600
That's funny to you?
Relax, mutt.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.809
What did you
say to me?

21:10.937 --> 21:12.854
Hey! Hey!
What did you say?

21:13.022 --> 21:14.189
Hey!

21:16.233 --> 21:17.525
Easy!

21:24.659 --> 21:26.284
Mutt?

21:26.452 --> 21:27.494
You out of your mind?

21:27.662 --> 21:28.954
When I was
a candidate
over at 38,

21:29.121 --> 21:30.705
they put menthol
in my underwear.

21:30.873 --> 21:31.539
What is the...
No, no, no.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.833
What you did was
so far beyond that,

21:34.001 --> 21:36.795
that if you can't tell
the difference, you are
dumber than you look.

21:37.880 --> 21:38.588
What...

21:38.756 --> 21:40.632
I mean, this house
was already
under a microscope.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.092
You really couldn't
put that together?

21:45.930 --> 21:48.473
You are so lucky
Mills is not filing
an incident report.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.310
Not to mention
knocking your teeth out.

21:54.355 --> 21:57.065
Did I not apologize?
You don't talk to me.
I'm serious.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.650
Shut up.
He's coming in.

22:01.779 --> 22:04.614
I told my boss
that the course work
was complete here

22:05.574 --> 22:07.742
but that a follow-up
might not hurt.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.870
I did not mention
the infraction,

22:11.956 --> 22:15.291
because it would turn
into a major, major deal.

22:15.459 --> 22:18.044
I've seen folks
lose their jobs
over less.

22:18.212 --> 22:19.254
And in my sense,

22:19.422 --> 22:21.506
this was
an isolated incident

22:21.674 --> 22:23.258
involving otherwise
good people.

22:25.886 --> 22:28.304
First of all,
let me say thank you.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.268
And second of all,
I can assure you that

22:33.436 --> 22:34.728
I will deal with
all of this...

22:35.730 --> 22:36.938
...in-house.

22:38.566 --> 22:39.858
How, exactly?

22:46.615 --> 22:48.241
Look,

22:48.409 --> 22:51.745
anybody asks,
I'll tell them you wanted
a change of scenery.

22:51.912 --> 22:54.039
A lot of guys
like to float from
house to house as it is.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.666
You know, if I had known
that kissing ass

22:56.834 --> 22:58.334
was the way to
move up in this house,

22:59.545 --> 23:00.837
I would have
bought some lip balm.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.424
Good luck, Hadley.

23:09.764 --> 23:10.972
Yeah, good luck.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.236
Come on.

23:38.876 --> 23:40.668
Why are you calling
my sister?

23:40.836 --> 23:44.255
I got an ethics panel
over at the I.G.'s
here in a little bit.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.884
I was looking for some
character references.

23:48.052 --> 23:49.302
Not her.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.722
You helped me out
of a jam.
I don't dispute that.

23:52.890 --> 23:53.765
But if you got
a favor you need done,

23:53.933 --> 23:55.892
you come to me
man-to-man and
leave her out of it.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.396
I hear you left Vice.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.649
What about it?

24:02.817 --> 24:05.318
Working in that
intelligence unit
here in the district?

24:12.952 --> 24:14.994
You got
backbone, Antonio.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.955
You've always been
an aggressive cop.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.166
I respect that.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.471
And?
You may be asked
to go back in,

24:33.639 --> 24:35.598
so, sit tight.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.822
I told you
not to contact her.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.615
Fine, I screwed up.
But...

24:52.783 --> 24:53.908
Big time.

24:54.076 --> 24:56.828
Now they're looking
into your history.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.163
Of?

24:58.330 --> 24:59.664
Other women you've...

25:02.585 --> 25:04.335
...banged on the job.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.839
What?
Remember
Nicki Rutkowski?

25:08.007 --> 25:10.508
What about her?
Her name came up.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.595
Did it end bad?
No!

25:18.976 --> 25:21.186
We slept together
a couple times,

25:21.353 --> 25:23.104
and she went on
her merry way.
Ask her.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.398
Oh, they're going to.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.360
Unreal.

25:31.906 --> 25:35.241
The new place
is very, uh, zen.

25:36.744 --> 25:37.952
I'm hardly here.

25:42.333 --> 25:43.750
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

25:46.462 --> 25:49.047
To new beginnings,
I guess. Right?

25:49.215 --> 25:50.465
I like it.

25:57.473 --> 26:00.141
Well, uh,
this is all your stuff.

26:00.309 --> 26:04.103
Just some pictures
and jewelry.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.730
And here's yours.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.066
Pictures and Blackhawk
memorabilia.

26:10.194 --> 26:11.778
I was wondering
where all that went.

26:12.780 --> 26:13.863
Yes.

26:19.453 --> 26:21.329
You know, I found
this contract
that we both signed

26:21.497 --> 26:23.790
after we had
that argument about
where to spend Christmas.

26:27.670 --> 26:29.796
Do you remember it?
I do. Yeah.

26:31.131 --> 26:34.217
Let's always keep
the fighting clean
and the sex dirty.

27:07.001 --> 27:10.545
I.G. Office on
a Tuesday afternoon.
That can't be good.

27:13.007 --> 27:16.009
Just remember,
squeakiest wheel
always wins around here.

27:16.885 --> 27:17.802
Looks like it.

27:19.513 --> 27:21.222
You're Benny Severide's
kid, huh?

27:22.558 --> 27:24.225
That's right.
Old Benny.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.315
I'll be seeing you around.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.570
Yeah, I don't plan on
making it out to
Myrtle Beach anytime soon.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.489
Well, neither do I.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.408
I just got reinstated.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.420
Where on the job?
No, he didn't say.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.422
God, has the world
gone crazy? What the heck
is going on?

27:54.590 --> 27:55.548
I know. Tell me about it.

27:55.716 --> 27:57.967
Well, they'll just
park him somewhere
behind a desk, right?

27:58.135 --> 27:59.302
Let him collect
a paycheck for nothing.

27:59.470 --> 28:00.887
I mean, if I'm CPD,
that's what I would want.

28:01.055 --> 28:02.263
That's got nothing
to do with it.

28:02.431 --> 28:03.514
It's what Voight wants.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.807
Damn it.

28:04.975 --> 28:06.517
Maybe I should have just
played ball with him.

28:06.685 --> 28:07.727
No, absolutely not.

28:07.895 --> 28:09.228
But now I'm on
his enemy list?

28:21.658 --> 28:24.035
Who's that?
Nicki's dad.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.083
Hey! Big Al!

28:30.250 --> 28:31.501
Hey, Wallace.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.586
What brings you out?

28:35.422 --> 28:38.925
I guess that Severide
character's got himself
in a bit of a pickle, huh?

28:39.093 --> 28:40.134
How'd that get
on your radar?

28:41.136 --> 28:43.096
Well, the girl he attacked,
her lawyer contacted me.

28:43.263 --> 28:44.263
Attacked?

28:44.431 --> 28:47.100
Since when do you
believe everything
lawyers tell you?

28:47.267 --> 28:49.102
Yeah, well.

28:49.269 --> 28:51.521
Regardless,
I guess they want
my account of events.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.648
They're looking
to establish a pattern
of behavior.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.566
And I wanted you
to hear it from me first

28:55.734 --> 28:56.984
out of respect
for our friendship.

28:57.152 --> 28:58.236
Hear what?

29:04.493 --> 29:05.827
How I came here
to pick Nicki up,

29:05.994 --> 29:08.287
and I saw him
guiding her out of
that change-out room

29:08.455 --> 29:09.664
after doing
God knows what.

29:09.832 --> 29:12.583
How she came home
in tears after being
over at his apartment.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.670
How she broke off
her engagement with
a guy I happened to like.

29:15.838 --> 29:17.588
And how Nicki came in
and quit her job
and ran off to Europe,

29:17.756 --> 29:20.550
and she hasn't been able
to get her life
back on track since.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.468
Al, I spoke to him.

29:22.636 --> 29:25.388
Nothing happened.
No, he was screwing around
with a subordinate,

29:25.556 --> 29:26.639
on the job.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.227
My daughter.

29:33.897 --> 29:34.856
And shame on me
for not having made

29:35.023 --> 29:36.023
a bigger stink
of it back then,

29:36.191 --> 29:38.192
because now
it looks like
a girl got hurt.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.612
Al, I know
you're pissed at him,

29:41.780 --> 29:43.573
but if you,
as a Chief
in the department,

29:43.740 --> 29:46.534
if you go forward
with your beef,
you will sink him.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.578
Do you really believe that
he didn't push that girl

29:48.745 --> 29:49.954
up against the wall
because she didn't
want to be

29:50.122 --> 29:51.622
another notch
on his belt?

29:54.877 --> 29:56.669
We go way back.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.546
I'm going to vouch
for Kelly Severide.

30:01.008 --> 30:03.468
Yeah, well,
like I said,

30:03.635 --> 30:04.927
I want you to
hear it from me.

30:06.722 --> 30:07.763
Please don't do this.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.391
I already did.
They have my statement.

30:15.439 --> 30:16.981
Yeah.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.399
Nice knowing you, Al.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.659
Ambulance 61,
fallen person.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.828
1610 Kedzie Street.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.710
Hurry, I think
my dad's sick.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.843
What's your dad's name?
Terrence. I'm Patrick.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.763
And that's Buddy.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.600
Okay.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.188
Okay, see ya.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.361
- Okay, here we go.
- What was that, a pet?

31:03.529 --> 31:05.363
What about my dad?
Something's wrong
with him.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.782
I don't believe this!

31:07.950 --> 31:09.867
Patrick, how long since
that snake bit your dad?

31:11.578 --> 31:13.329
Patrick?

31:13.497 --> 31:15.706
My dad says
not to tell anyone
about Buddy.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.333
We're not supposed to
have him.

31:17.501 --> 31:18.668
How long, sweetie?

31:20.587 --> 31:21.963
Ten minutes.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.006
Okay, I'm gonna call
animal control.

31:24.174 --> 31:25.841
What kind of
snake is it?
Rhino viper.

31:26.009 --> 31:28.010
He got out of his cage.

31:28.178 --> 31:29.929
We got to go back
in there.

31:30.097 --> 31:31.681
Bitch, are you
out of your...

31:34.518 --> 31:36.227
Dear valued colleague,
I strongly disagree

31:36.395 --> 31:37.353
with your
suggested course...

31:37.521 --> 31:40.565
Okay, God only knows
what rhino viper venom
does to a person, okay?

31:40.732 --> 31:42.483
We can't wait
on animal control.

31:42.651 --> 31:43.651
He might not even
have 30 minutes.

31:45.153 --> 31:49.073
Patrick, hi, um,
what does your dad use
to handle Buddy?

31:49.241 --> 31:50.575
The hook.

31:52.703 --> 31:53.869
The hook. Come on.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.175
Here it is.

32:16.018 --> 32:18.477
That is
a long ass snake.

32:25.861 --> 32:27.862
Here.
Whoa! What?

32:28.030 --> 32:30.489
You do it.
I can't. I can't.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.329
Okay, Patrick.

32:36.496 --> 32:37.663
What do I do?

32:37.831 --> 32:40.916
Dad puts the hook
under him
and grabs his tail.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.794
Mmm-hmm.
Grabs his tail.
Right, of course.

32:55.849 --> 32:57.350
Hey, Buddy.

32:59.394 --> 33:01.687
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

33:06.777 --> 33:08.194
Oh, God! Okay.

33:11.865 --> 33:13.741
We've got to
try again.
Yeah.

33:15.077 --> 33:17.495
Just... try again.

33:27.089 --> 33:28.464
Come on.

33:43.647 --> 33:46.190
Come on.
Yes. Yes. Yes.

33:49.611 --> 33:52.655
Nightmares.
I will have nightmares.

33:59.496 --> 34:01.247
Okay, let's put him
in the chair
and get him out of here.

34:06.628 --> 34:07.920
Watch the cabinet.

34:12.926 --> 34:15.136
Let's go.
Is he gonna be okay?

34:15.303 --> 34:16.554
He'll be okay.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.140
Hop in.

34:32.279 --> 34:33.946
What's up?

34:34.114 --> 34:35.698
Uh, a couple things.

34:35.866 --> 34:38.743
Internally,
Tara's not gonna be
acting on the charges.

34:39.995 --> 34:40.995
What do you mean,
internally?

34:41.163 --> 34:42.204
Are the charges
dropped or not?

34:42.372 --> 34:44.665
Well, that's where
it gets complicated.

34:46.168 --> 34:48.335
She's been reinstated as
commander of operations

34:48.503 --> 34:49.754
at field division
headquarters.

34:51.673 --> 34:52.757
Promoted?

34:52.924 --> 34:54.341
IAD felt
an administrative post

34:54.509 --> 34:55.760
might be
a better fit for her.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.345
For a liar?
IAD lacked

34:58.513 --> 35:00.890
the sufficient amount of
confidence needed

35:01.057 --> 35:02.725
to disprove her claim,

35:02.893 --> 35:06.812
so they wanted to
move quickly to
have this go away.

35:07.981 --> 35:12.151
Great! You know what?
Make her the Queen
of England, I don't care.

35:12.319 --> 35:13.903
Are we done?

35:14.070 --> 35:15.196
No.

35:16.323 --> 35:21.035
Because of
Chief Rutkowski's rather
incendiary statement,

35:21.203 --> 35:23.329
the I.G. Has sustained
Tara's allegations.

35:23.497 --> 35:26.791
They're kicking the case
up to the State's
Attorney's office.

35:26.958 --> 35:27.958
Meaning what?

35:28.126 --> 35:29.919
Meaning they will
review it.

35:30.086 --> 35:32.755
And if they feel
there's a case,

35:32.923 --> 35:34.256
they'll file charges.

35:34.424 --> 35:35.841
Criminal charges.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.885
You need to get
an attorney, Kelly.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.013
You need to be ready.

35:41.181 --> 35:42.431
Listen,

35:43.558 --> 35:45.559
this is not
coming from me.

35:45.727 --> 35:49.855
But it was put out there
that if you did apologize

35:50.023 --> 35:52.817
for what she's claiming,
it might go
a long way towards...

36:10.377 --> 36:12.086
I walked her
to the door.

36:14.965 --> 36:15.965
We're gonna fight this.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.385
We're gonna be all right.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.807
I don't trust anyone
in this world
other than you.

36:30.647 --> 36:32.064
Hey, buddy. We heard.

36:33.275 --> 36:34.692
No one can believe it.

36:35.777 --> 36:38.112
Look, we're doing
our soft opening tonight.

36:38.280 --> 36:41.031
Maybe you want to
come down, tie one on,
be around your friends.

36:43.410 --> 36:44.785
I'm not up for it.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.745
No. Of course.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.873
All right.
Hang in there, man.

36:58.592 --> 37:00.301
This is it, you guys.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.303
Ready or not.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.638
I got jitters,
I ain't gonna lie.

37:04.806 --> 37:07.766
This is probably,
like, the craziest,

37:07.934 --> 37:10.686
riskiest, insanest thing
any of us has ever done.

37:10.854 --> 37:12.396
And for Herrmann,
that's saying something.

37:13.857 --> 37:15.065
But if nothing else,

37:16.526 --> 37:20.863
I have had so much fun
spending all those days
off and all the wee hours

37:21.031 --> 37:22.740
building Molly's
with you guys.

37:23.742 --> 37:24.950
And...

37:25.118 --> 37:26.785
I know that
you guys have heart
because I saw it

37:26.953 --> 37:29.246
when you put it
in the business,

37:29.414 --> 37:30.956
and I just want you
to know that

37:31.791 --> 37:33.167
I consider
you guys family.

37:34.753 --> 37:35.753
You're my brothers.

37:38.715 --> 37:40.299
Whoa.

37:40.467 --> 37:42.217
You're beautiful.

37:42.385 --> 37:45.763
I know it's been
a tough couple of
shifts for everybody.

37:45.931 --> 37:48.682
But that is why
this place is gonna
rock tonight.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.602
Because we're gonna
put aside our worries,

37:51.770 --> 37:54.313
and we're just gonna
have a good time.

37:55.148 --> 37:56.315
Amen.
Amen.

37:56.483 --> 37:57.775
Amen.
To Molly's.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.526
To Molly's.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.278
Does it sound like
we're saying, "tamales"?

38:02.155 --> 38:04.782
What... Who cares?
This place is gonna rock!

38:04.950 --> 38:06.283
I hope so, 'cause I'm
a little concerned

38:06.451 --> 38:07.952
about the number of hits
we're getting on Facebook.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.870
Oh, my gosh.
Not as much traffic as
I want. Not to mention...

38:10.038 --> 38:13.207
Will you please
celebrate the moment,
for God's sake.

38:15.794 --> 38:16.794
To Molly's.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.393
Come on, another one.
All right, another one.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.270
Throw it out!

38:35.438 --> 38:36.897
Come on! Come on.

38:37.065 --> 38:38.941
Come on.
Come on, man.

38:49.953 --> 38:51.662
- Are you guys good?
- We're great!

38:51.830 --> 38:52.871
All right.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.499
Crazy, ain't it?

38:57.669 --> 38:58.752
Who is this guy?

38:58.920 --> 39:00.671
That's my Uncle Zoozie!

39:00.839 --> 39:05.092
Hey, so I cannot
stop thinking about
Tara being promoted?

39:05.260 --> 39:07.886
Oh, she is a bureau
bitch now. We're never
gonna see her.

39:08.054 --> 39:10.097
Oh, if I do,
I'm gonna drop her.

39:10.265 --> 39:11.598
Not joking.

39:15.478 --> 39:16.979
Good to see you.
Thanks.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.941
When did that happen?

39:24.195 --> 39:25.362
Good for them.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.617
Oh, yeah...

39:38.960 --> 39:40.878
Cop walks into a bar.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.969
Whoa. It's a nice place.

39:50.305 --> 39:51.430
Congratulations.

39:58.146 --> 39:59.480
Chief.

40:04.986 --> 40:08.947
Listen, there's... been
a lot of bad blood

40:09.115 --> 40:11.492
between cops and firemen
in this district.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.454
Since we're all
gonna be working together,

40:17.707 --> 40:19.792
I want to be the first
to put it all behind us.

40:29.886 --> 40:31.178
This round's on me.

40:37.644 --> 40:39.228
So what was
that about?

40:39.395 --> 40:41.021
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

40:42.857 --> 40:44.525
What?

40:44.692 --> 40:45.984
He was promoted
to Sergeant,

40:46.152 --> 40:47.903
and he's running
the Intelligence Unit.

40:49.072 --> 40:50.614
You're in
the Intelligence Unit.

40:50.782 --> 40:51.824
Don't I know it.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.463
I want to apologize.
To you both.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.715
It got way out of hand.

41:09.592 --> 41:10.551
You know,
as it turns out

41:10.718 --> 41:12.469
my son needed
to hit rock bottom.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.015
Prison has certainly
provided that.

41:21.688 --> 41:23.272
I just want to say
I'm sorry.

41:26.568 --> 41:29.319
And I am looking forward
to working with you,
Lieutenant.
