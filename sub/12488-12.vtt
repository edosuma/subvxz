WEBVTT

00:05.547 --> 00:06.548
- Aah.

00:06.631 --> 00:08.258
- Ooh.

00:08.341 --> 00:11.594
- If I have to do one more
sprint my legs might fall off.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.596
- You know what?

00:13.680 --> 00:15.140
I think I'm just gonna
sleep here tonight.

00:15.223 --> 00:16.391
Bella, can you toss me one
of your fluffy pillows.

00:16.474 --> 00:17.976
Goodnight.

00:18.059 --> 00:21.604
- Oh, you think today's
practice was hard?

00:21.688 --> 00:22.313
Wait 'til tomorrow.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.524
- Ooh.

00:24.607 --> 00:25.608
- Oh, man.

00:25.692 --> 00:29.696
- Coach, can I ask you
a question, man to man.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.156
Why are you pushing us so hard?

00:33.032 --> 00:35.118
- Yeah.
Okay, we're on a three game

00:35.201 --> 00:36.619
win streak and on pace to make
the playoffs.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.121
Can't we ease up a little?

00:38.204 --> 00:41.624
- Oh, listen, guys, I know
you're tired but we've gotta

00:41.708 --> 00:43.501
work hard and push through.

00:43.585 --> 00:46.838
The team that quits is
the team that loses.

00:46.921 --> 00:49.758
Which is gonna be my mantra
tonight at Poppy's All You Can

00:49.841 --> 00:52.093
Eat Sloppy Joe Buffet truck.

00:55.138 --> 00:58.141
- Thanks for trying, Bella,
but it doesn't seem like

00:58.224 --> 01:00.643
this torture is ending
any time soon.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.604
- Oh, tell me about it.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.522
I'm so tired after
I get home from practice,

01:04.605 --> 01:06.608
I keep falling asleep
and missing bonding time

01:06.691 --> 01:07.901
with my new pony.

01:07.984 --> 01:12.739
And I cannot let my sister turn
any more animals against me.

01:12.822 --> 01:15.325
- My feet are so sore I've had
to wear my comfy slippers

01:15.408 --> 01:18.077
to school.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.245
- Me too, sister.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.208

{\an8}- Before school tape sessions,
after school practices...

02:08.461 --> 02:09.586
{\an8}Coach is killing us
and the administration

02:09.670 --> 02:10.588
{\an8}doesn't even care.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.632
{\an8}- Yeah.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.175
{\an8}What kind of clown is
running this place, man?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.969
{\an8}- [clears throat]
- Principal Davis!

02:16.052 --> 02:20.390
{\an8}Erm, what I meant was
uh...uh...

02:20.473 --> 02:24.894
{\an8}kids love clowns, you know.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.979
{\an8}I'm gonna stop talking.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.606
{\an8}- Guys, practice is cancelled.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.150
{\an8}Coach and his staff got food
poisoning from a low rent

02:31.234 --> 02:34.529
{\an8}Sloppy Joe truck.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.322
- They're going
to be okay, right?

02:36.406 --> 02:37.907
- Well they're pretty sick.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.702
The sounds I heard on the other
end of that call with Coach

02:40.785 --> 02:43.580
shook me to my core.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.540
I doubt they'll be
back before next week.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.584
But, don't worry, kids,
I will find a replacement Coach

02:47.667 --> 02:49.210
by tomorrow.

02:49.294 --> 02:53.548
- Uh, Principal Davis, look,
I know I'm just a student

02:53.631 --> 02:57.260
and it's none of my business
but what about Mr. Kurtz,

02:57.343 --> 02:59.554
the substitute teacher?

02:59.637 --> 03:00.722
- Mr. Kurtz?

03:00.805 --> 03:01.890
Isn't he kind of--

03:01.973 --> 03:05.018
- --amazing.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.936
Mr. Kurtz would
be a great choice.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.273
- The man is teacherly.

03:10.356 --> 03:13.026
- I was hoping to hire someone
with coaching experience.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.904
But, Kurtz is always available.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.948
I'll call him now.

03:19.032 --> 03:19.574
- Seriously?

03:19.657 --> 03:21.701
Mr. Kurtz?

03:21.784 --> 03:22.869
The guy who took 20 minutes
to get his tie unstuck

03:22.952 --> 03:24.746
from the pencil sharpener?

03:24.829 --> 03:26.956
He's kind of a joke.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.166
- Kind of?

03:28.249 --> 03:30.543
Oh, no, the dude's
completely incompetent.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.087
Which means we'll get
the break we finally deserve.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.714
- But what about
our winning streak?

03:34.797 --> 03:36.174
And the playoffs?

03:36.257 --> 03:37.467
- Bella, relax.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.801
We're playing
the Wildcats this week.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.679
A team we crushed so badly last
year that I played in that game.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.723
I played.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.475
Me.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.101
- For the whole second half.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.395
- Yeah, that's crazy
because he is not good.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.271
- No.

03:50.355 --> 03:53.483
- Thank you friends.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.652
Look, Bella, what I'm trying
to say is we'll be fine.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.528
I played.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.365
Me.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.245
- Oh, Pepper!

04:06.329 --> 04:07.914
I just bumped
into the most awesome guy.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.999
- Oh! Paint me a picture!

04:10.083 --> 04:11.834
Canvas, colors, textures... go!

04:11.918 --> 04:13.836
- Okay, so I was headed
to the gym this morning,

04:13.920 --> 04:16.172
I was a little late because
abuela made me tamales--

04:16.255 --> 04:16.755
- Not painting fast enough!

04:16.839 --> 04:18.841
- I'm sorry.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.344
He's super cool
and has the most amazing eyes.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.346
I can't tell whether they're
sparkly or smouldery,

04:23.429 --> 04:25.014
but...either way, I'm in.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.892
- That is such a coincidence!

04:27.976 --> 04:30.853
I just me a super cool,
super cute boy in the library

04:30.937 --> 04:34.482
and he was paying a late fee,
which means he's responsible,

04:34.565 --> 04:35.650
but also a little bit
of a bad boy.

04:35.733 --> 04:36.693
- Whoo!

04:36.776 --> 04:37.735
Is there chemistry?

04:37.819 --> 04:39.988
- Explosive.

04:40.071 --> 04:40.947
Silent chemistry.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.700
- So, you're over Sawyer?

04:43.783 --> 04:45.034
- Completely.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.204
We're happy just being friends
and I'm ready for some new love

04:48.287 --> 04:50.206
puppies...

04:50.289 --> 04:52.417
puppy love.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.545
Sounded better in my head.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.965
- [squeal] I'm happy for us!

04:59.048 --> 05:00.466
- Hey.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.719
- Hi, Cole.
- Hi, Cole.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.973
- Wait, is that the...
- Yeah.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.684
Is that your...
- Uh huh.

05:10.893 --> 05:12.562
I gotta go.
- Me too.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.772
- Goodbye.

05:18.026 --> 05:18.901
- Look!

05:18.985 --> 05:22.405
I'm so excited for this week!

05:22.488 --> 05:24.615
- This practice is
going to be a breeze.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.575
- [whistle peep]

05:25.658 --> 05:27.660
- All right, guys.
Bring it in.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.538
I'm Mr. Kurtz and it has been
brought to my attention that,

05:30.621 --> 05:32.790
uh, I have a reputation
of a little bit of a pushover

05:32.874 --> 05:37.587
and a "failed educator".

05:37.670 --> 05:40.631
Well that all stops today
because from now on,

05:40.715 --> 05:44.677
I will be a model substitute.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.596
- You guys gave it
your best shot.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.556
- We're going to work hard,
we're going to follow your

05:48.639 --> 05:50.892
Coach's playbook and we're going
to get you ready for the game

05:50.975 --> 05:53.102
against the Wildcats.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.771
Anybody got a problem with that?

05:54.854 --> 05:55.938
- Oh.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.106
- Hey, come on, guys.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.650
The man's just
trying to do his job.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.652
Respect the sub.

06:03.654 --> 06:07.408
- Thank you...kid I've
seen in the hallway.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.826
All right now, first up.

06:08.910 --> 06:13.372
Team...wow, that is some
terrible handwriting.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.751
I can't tell if that's
100 Slurpees or 100 burpees.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.503
- Please let it be Slurpees.
Please let it be Slurpees.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.297
- Nope.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.298
It says burpees.

06:22.381 --> 06:22.924
Yep, let's do those.

06:23.007 --> 06:25.802
What's a burpee?

06:25.885 --> 06:27.387
- Uh...you know, Mr. Kurtz, this
binder can be pretty confusing

06:27.470 --> 06:29.806
if you haven't played
football before.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.140
- Yes, well I haven't.

06:31.224 --> 06:31.682
I haven't even watched it.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.976
- Oh!

06:34.060 --> 06:35.394
Great, well, you know, why don't
I just run you through our

06:35.478 --> 06:38.147
normal practice routine then?
- Oh, okay.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.357
- Yeah.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.985
On Tuesdays we really
focus on, uh...recovery.

06:43.069 --> 06:46.322
- And silent reflection
upon last week's game.

06:46.405 --> 06:46.614
- Very silent.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.407
Shh.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.368
- But, Troy, we have
a game coming up.

06:50.451 --> 06:53.329
Shouldn't we at least
run some passing drills?

06:53.412 --> 06:54.580
- That's right, Bella.

06:54.664 --> 06:58.709
On Tuesdays we visualize
the passing drills.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.003
In our minds.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.049
- Visualize.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.592
But that doesn't seem right.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.512
- Well, you know that...
that's what we say, you know.

07:09.595 --> 07:14.267
But then Coach told us
that the last four NFL MVPs

07:14.350 --> 07:17.562
used visualizing
to up their game.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.021
Shocking.
- That's right.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.481
- Wow.
Well, you know what,

07:20.565 --> 07:22.233
if it's good enough
for the pros then, hey,

07:22.316 --> 07:23.985
it's good enough for us.
- Right.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.862
- ALL: Yeah.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.697
- Everybody,
let's get visualizing.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.031
- Yes!

07:29.115 --> 07:30.032
- Yeah, everybody relax.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.786
I'll turn off the lights
and close your eyes.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.497
- Huh, yeah.

07:36.581 --> 07:40.543
I am no expert,
but this looks good.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.504
- Oh! I just caught a touchdown.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.632
No... I dropped it.

07:46.716 --> 07:47.758
- Keep trying, little man.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.678
Keep trying.

07:50.761 --> 07:53.389
Okay, if anybody needs me
I'll be in my office,

07:53.472 --> 07:57.727
visualizing a pizza...
with everything on it.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.732
- Bella, you should really
be taking advantage of this.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.066
Look, you deserve a break.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.736
Plus, with the playoffs coming
up we won't have extra time off

08:06.819 --> 08:08.863
for months.
- Yeah, I know.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.907
I want a break too,
but I'm worried about the game

08:10.990 --> 08:14.869
on Saturday.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.663
- Okay, then...uh, let's
sit down and talk about it.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.250
Look, Bella, if you're
concerned, I'm concerned.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.543
All right, talk to me.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.712
- Okay, I just don't think
this is a good idea.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.589
We're in the middle of football
season and Coach says we always

08:26.672 --> 08:31.719
need to be prepared and
whoever gives up first...oooh!

08:31.802 --> 08:33.929
I quit.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.519
- I can't believe we like
the same guy

08:40.602 --> 08:44.232
and he's sitting right there,
just taunting us.

08:44.315 --> 08:47.443
- Technically we
did follow him here.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.612
- Good point.

08:49.695 --> 08:50.780
- But you know what?

08:50.863 --> 08:52.782
Now that I see him,
he's not all that.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.242
- Yeah.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.284
Cole's no Zac Efron...

08:55.368 --> 08:57.578
except for the eyes.
- And that smile.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.247
- And the hair.
- And that everything.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.749
- It's just like, we get it.

09:01.832 --> 09:04.126
You're charming
and you look great in leather...

09:04.210 --> 09:04.919
and denim...

09:05.002 --> 09:07.964
and shirts.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.465
- This is so dumb.

09:09.548 --> 09:11.467
We might like him, but that
doesn't mean he likes us.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.427
- Yeah, you're right.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.471
We don't even have
to worry about it.

09:15.554 --> 09:16.389
Oh, we didn't order this.

09:16.472 --> 09:19.767
- I know.
The smoldering shy guy did.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.353
- Who did he say it was for?

09:22.436 --> 09:24.772
- He didn't. He left a note.

09:26.565 --> 09:28.734
- I think you're cute, Cole.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.445
- He thinks we're cute.
- He thinks we're cute.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.823
- Wait.
- Oh no.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.002
- Hey, tell me again
why your Coach has you do this

09:46.085 --> 09:47.461
on Thursdays?

09:47.545 --> 09:49.714
- Uh, it improves our
hand/eye coordination.

09:49.797 --> 09:53.676
- Yeah, the last four
NFL MVPs swear by it.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.344
- Wow, thank goodness
for those four MVPs.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.638
I mean if it wasn't for them
I'd have you guys running laps

09:57.722 --> 09:59.181
like an idiot.

10:01.851 --> 10:05.146
- With Mr. Kurtz these practices
have been so much less painful.

10:05.229 --> 10:08.649
Still less painful.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.651
- And my feet feel
so much better to.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.195
I finally put my slippers away.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.155
- Big mistake.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.824
My toes are on safari.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.784
- How about you Sawyer?
How's that new pony?

10:18.868 --> 10:20.328
- We're totally bonded now.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.246
She imprinted on me.

10:24.999 --> 10:29.211
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's
not what imprinting is.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.964
- Guys, you need to see this.

10:33.632 --> 10:34.717
- Ace McFumbles here
with a Bulldog update.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.679
The once hapless Wildcats,
who we pummeled

10:38.763 --> 10:41.307
45-7 last year, are now
undefeated and feature one

10:41.390 --> 10:43.976
of the best defenses in Texas.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.728
- Oh.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.855
- They're so much bigger
than last year.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.398
- And faster
- And stronger.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.900
- Does that guy have a beard?

10:50.983 --> 10:56.072
- Guys, this must be why
Coach was pushing us so hard.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.823
But we haven't done
anything this week.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.658
We're going to get crushed.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.243
- Yeah, hold on one second.
Okay.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.245
Hey, guys, quick question,
do you know what time

11:03.329 --> 11:04.413
the game is tomorrow?

11:04.497 --> 11:06.582
I got the cable guy coming
between three and five.

11:06.665 --> 11:09.251
So...Oh!

11:09.335 --> 11:10.461
Oh, yeah.
Do you know what?

11:10.544 --> 11:12.338
They're just disconnecting it.
I don't have to be there.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.131
That's great news.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.265
- This can't be happening.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.893
Last year the Wildcats were
a team of kids just like me.

11:25.976 --> 11:30.773
Now they look like a team of
kids who eat kids, just like me.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.817
- They're going to crush us
and it's gonna hurt.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.112
- Bella, you knew this
Mr. Kurtz thing was a bad idea.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.949
Why didn't you save us
from ourselves.

11:40.032 --> 11:43.577
- You just stood there
and let us make mistakes.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.162
Shame.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.706
Shame on you.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.960
- Okay, first of all...

11:52.211 --> 11:54.505
- No!

11:54.588 --> 11:57.383
Isn't my guilt
punishment enough?

11:57.466 --> 11:59.385
- What are we going to do?

11:59.468 --> 12:00.719
We're doomed.

12:00.803 --> 12:01.971
- Okay, don't worry.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.097
There's an easy solution.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.016
Coach left us exact
instructions on what to do.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.226
Remember they're in his binder.

12:07.309 --> 12:10.729
- The binder.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.774
- Yes, the practice binder
with all our plays

12:13.858 --> 12:16.569
and everything you need
to run our practices.

12:16.652 --> 12:17.111
- Yes, that binder.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.988
Yeah.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.406
Pretty sure I left
that in the gym.

12:20.489 --> 12:21.699
No...the library.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.659
No...it's definitely
somewhere in town.

12:23.742 --> 12:27.246
Depending on where
that bus was going.

12:27.329 --> 12:30.207
- You lost it?
- There goes our winning streak.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.209
- Maybe even the playoffs.
- We're ruined.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.169
- What's the big deal?

12:33.252 --> 12:34.753
You guys said you
didn't need that anyway.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.881
- We lied, man.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.008
It's super important.

12:39.091 --> 12:42.803
- I told myself I'd never be
fooled by students again.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.014
I'm too trusting.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.725
Okay, I'm gonna find
that binder.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.810
I just have to ride
the bus a lot.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.190
- That dude is
never going to find it.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.775
- His plan has so
many holes in it.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.360
- Okay, so we don't have
the binder,

12:58.444 --> 13:00.362
but we can go to the guy
who made the binder.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.156
Let's go get Coach.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.866
- And enter his house
of sickness?

13:03.949 --> 13:08.329
Maybe we should wait
and see how Mr. Kurtz does.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.748
- Forgot my bus pass.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.459
Where is my bus pass?

13:13.542 --> 13:15.503
It's in the binder.

13:17.004 --> 13:19.215
- Let's go get Coach.

13:25.763 --> 13:26.722
- Oh!

13:26.805 --> 13:27.097
Hey, Cole!

13:27.181 --> 13:28.224
My hair?

13:28.307 --> 13:29.433
Thanks.

13:29.517 --> 13:32.019
I woke up like this.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.313
- You did not wake up like that.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.689
- Oh yeah?

13:35.773 --> 13:37.233
Why are you so dressed up?

13:37.316 --> 13:39.401
You wouldn't happen to be
on your way to talk to Cole,

13:39.485 --> 13:40.986
would you?

13:41.070 --> 13:44.949
- I have a class presentation
about the...

13:45.032 --> 13:46.784
importance of...uh...

13:46.867 --> 13:48.702
dressing up!

13:48.786 --> 13:50.579
For class presentations.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.248
- Oh...[false laugh] yeah.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.749
Nice try.

13:53.832 --> 13:56.752
- Oh well, you're wearing your
too short for school skirt.

13:56.835 --> 13:58.379
You were going to talk to Cole.

13:58.462 --> 13:59.505
- Yeah.

13:59.588 --> 14:00.214
To confirm what we already know.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.550
He likes me.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.261
- If by "me" you mean me...

14:05.344 --> 14:07.513
then that's exactly
what you're going to find out.

14:07.596 --> 14:11.058
- That doesn't make any sense.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.101
Great!

14:12.184 --> 14:13.352
You made me miss my chance.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.730
- I think you mean I made
you miss...my chance.

14:16.814 --> 14:17.815
- Whatever.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.066
I'm done with you.

14:19.149 --> 14:19.608
- I'm done with you too.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.444
- Fine.
- Fine.

14:22.528 --> 14:26.407
- Stupid short skirt.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.829
- It's nice of you guys
to come by.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.622
You're my first visitors.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.416
- Oh, since you've been sick?

14:35.499 --> 14:39.420
- No.

14:39.503 --> 14:43.007
- Uh...well, we just came
by because we missed you.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.049
So if you're feeling healthy
enough to come back,

14:44.133 --> 14:46.385
you should come back.
Why don't you come back?

14:46.468 --> 14:48.721
Come back.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.348
- Yeah, Coach.
- Please.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.268
- Look, it means a lot to me
that you guys want me back

14:54.351 --> 14:58.272
so bad and even though
I feel terrible

14:58.355 --> 15:00.232
I'm gonna be a man
and push through it.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.067
God, no!

15:05.779 --> 15:07.615
[vomiting sounds]
- Ooh!

15:07.698 --> 15:09.992
- COACH: Remember me as I was.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.536
A hero in your eyes.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.704
- Why am I here?

15:13.787 --> 15:15.664
I don't even play!

15:15.748 --> 15:16.790
- It's hopeless.

15:16.874 --> 15:17.541
The game is in two days.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.169
- We still have one option.

15:20.252 --> 15:24.840
Coach, we tricked Mr. Davis into
hiring Mr. Kurtz so we could

15:24.923 --> 15:26.383
slack off.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.135
And then he lost your binder
and we're sorry.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.012
But now we don't know
what to do.

15:30.095 --> 15:30.888
- That was your option?

15:30.971 --> 15:33.057
Bella, the truth is never
an option.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.350
What is wrong with you?

15:34.433 --> 15:35.517
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:35.601 --> 15:36.810
Don't panic.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.270
Now, there's nothing in that
binder that you don't already

15:38.354 --> 15:40.356
know.

15:40.439 --> 15:43.025
My plan was to train you guys
extra hard.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.485
I knew if we could
outlast the Wildcats,

15:44.568 --> 15:46.153
we...we could beat them.

15:46.236 --> 15:51.450
Now if you'll excuse me
I've gotta go blow my nose.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.788
[vomiting sounds]

15:55.871 --> 15:57.081
- [toilet flushing]

15:57.164 --> 15:58.332
- That is the sound of our
winning streak going down

15:58.415 --> 16:00.376
the drain.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.669
- Hold on.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.754
We still have two days to get
a whole week of practice in.

16:03.837 --> 16:06.215
- How are we gonna do that?

16:06.298 --> 16:08.050
- We're gonna push ourselves.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.593
We're going to run
all the drills,

16:09.677 --> 16:11.762
plays and formations Coach has
pounded into our heads

16:11.845 --> 16:13.305
all season.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.848
The only way we stand a chance
of beating the Wildcats is

16:14.932 --> 16:18.268
if we do some serious
make-up work.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.645
- Hmm.

16:19.728 --> 16:22.564
Or, alternative pitch,
Puppy Sloppy Joe gift basket

16:22.648 --> 16:23.732
for the Wildcats?

16:23.816 --> 16:29.321
And we let it do
the work for us.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.657
No? No?
Okay, hard work it is.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.915
- Ooh!
You look good.

16:39.998 --> 16:41.792
And by you, I mean me.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.920
- Oh...[false laugh] hilarious.

16:45.003 --> 16:47.631
Did you have fun in your
waddling skirt yesterday,

16:47.715 --> 16:49.466
penguin lady?

16:49.550 --> 16:51.510
- I looked so good
I was sent home to change.

16:51.593 --> 16:52.636
- Oh, please.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.680
You were sent home because
your skirt was too short.

16:54.763 --> 16:55.764
I should know.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.725
I was the one who complained.

16:57.808 --> 16:58.892
- Seriously?

16:58.976 --> 16:59.977
- Seriously.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.019
So what?

17:01.103 --> 17:01.979
- So what?

17:02.062 --> 17:03.439
I'll show you so what.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.940
- Oh, you did not
just neck roll me.

17:05.022 --> 17:07.693
- Take that wagging finger
out of my face

17:07.776 --> 17:09.278
before I make you eat it.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.696
- [gasps]

17:12.698 --> 17:13.906
- What is wrong with us?

17:13.991 --> 17:17.118
- We're letting
a guy tear us apart.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.454
I'm so sorry.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.123
- I'm sorry too.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.625
- We have to do something
about this.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.377
- I know what to do.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.878
Do you trust me?

17:26.962 --> 17:27.963
- I trust you.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.381
- Follow me.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.303
- Oh, hey girls.
- Listen Efron eyes,

17:34.386 --> 17:35.137
we know you like one of us,

17:35.220 --> 17:37.055
but we don't care
which one it is...

17:37.139 --> 17:38.640
and you need
to leave us alone.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.975
- But, I...
- No.

17:40.058 --> 17:42.561
Pepper and I are best friends
and we're not gonna let you come

17:42.644 --> 17:44.563
between us.

17:45.939 --> 17:48.317
- And just think, all of this
could have been avoided

17:48.400 --> 17:50.652
if you just told me you
liked me directly.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.362
- SOPHIE: Pepper!

17:58.744 --> 18:01.872
- All right, guys, we have five
days of practices in two days.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.249
We're going to have to use every
free minute to get ready

18:04.333 --> 18:06.877
before school, after school
and in-between classes.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.045
Let's do this!

{\an8}up his sleeve.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.317
- Okay, guys, here's the plan.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.403
After the game I'm gonna take
the cross-town bus,

19:14.486 --> 19:18.490
make it home to meet the cable
guy to turn the cable back on.

19:18.574 --> 19:22.828
Said he'd give me ten extra
days if I gave him $30 cash.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.246
Trust me, it's a good deal.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.584
- I don't know how
I'm going to do it.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.460
I am so tired.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.921
- I'm exhausted just
watching you guys.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.632
- Okay, I'm worn out too.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.968
But Coach said
if we quit we lose...

19:38.051 --> 19:39.469
and I'm not quitting.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.263
We just need one more play.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.806
Now who's with me?

19:42.890 --> 19:44.141
- We all are, Bella.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.726
- Come on!
- Let's go!

19:45.809 --> 19:47.769
- [cheering]

19:47.853 --> 19:53.859
- ♪

19:57.696 --> 19:59.239
- Ten!

20:02.117 --> 20:03.827
Hut!

20:26.016 --> 20:27.184
- [whistle blowing]

20:27.267 --> 20:30.854
- [cheering]

20:32.856 --> 20:34.024
{\an8}- Quarterback sneak.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.901
{\an8}The Bulldogs win.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.362
- [cheering]
- Whoo!

20:40.530 --> 20:41.615
- Wow.

20:41.698 --> 20:44.868
That celebration took
a lot out of me.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.287
- Good game, guys.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.998
But we can't ever be
unprepared like that again.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.541
- Whoo.

21:00.968 --> 21:03.220
- Anyone missing a Coach?

21:03.303 --> 21:03.553
- [cheering]

21:03.637 --> 21:05.305
- Coach!

21:05.389 --> 21:05.889
- Good to see you big guy.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.517
- Welcome back, Coach.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.935
- I was never contagious, Newt.

21:10.018 --> 21:13.230
- I am not taking any chances.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.190
- Seriously, we are
so glad you're back.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.400
- Oh, thanks.

21:16.483 --> 21:18.860
But I'm sure
Mr. Kurtz wasn't so bad.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.156
- Good news.

21:23.240 --> 21:26.743
Took me two days, 24 bus trips,
but I found the binder.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.036
Turns out it was on my kitchen
table under a stack

21:28.120 --> 21:29.955
of unpaid cable bills.
- Yeah?

21:30.038 --> 21:32.374
Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.126
Inside you'll find
my application to be

21:34.209 --> 21:35.836
your Assistant Coach.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.045
- Well, I don't see
any application in here.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.798
But there is this bus pass.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.091
- Oh, sweet!

21:41.174 --> 21:42.384
You found it.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.302
This day just keeps
getting better and better.

21:45.303 --> 21:48.724
- Coach, don't ever
get sick again.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.143
- Uh, uh.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.394
- Suit up.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.563
Wind sprints on the field
in four minutes.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.941
- Oh, man! Coach!
- Oh! You just...come on!
