HE WON'T GET TREATMENT
'CAUSE HE'S WORRIED

00:27.777 --> 00:30.405
THAT HIS FAMILY WON'T BE
PROVIDED FOR IF HE DIES.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.449
I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS
HIS BEHAVIOR.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.867
SOME OF IT.
THE REST IS JUST HIM.

HIS 3 KIDS.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.255
SHE FALLS APART,

07:02.255 --> 07:05.049
AND 60 SECONDS LATER, SHE IS
LYING THROUGH HER TEETH --

07:05.049 --> 07:07.260
SHE HAS NO IDEA HOW HER HUSBAND
MADE A LIVING.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.555
MEANWHILE, SHE GOT A 60-INCH
BIG-SCREEN TV RIGHT BEHIND HER.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.265
SHE'S GOTTA SURVIVE
IN THAT WORLD.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.724
EVEN MOBSTER WIVES,

07:13.724 --> 07:16.269
WHEN THEIR HUSBANDS GET WHACKED,
START POINTING THEIR FINGER.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.603
NOT ON THE WITNESS STAND.

HOW MUCH ARE THE DOGS

09:22.770 --> 09:24.021
$3,000.

09:24.021 --> 09:25.356
YOU'RE KIDDING.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.567
THE SIRE WAS A BRAZILIAN
GRAND CHAMPION,

09:27.567 --> 09:30.236
AND BRIDGET WAS THE '98
BEST IN BREED AT WESTMINSTER.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.238

AREN'T YOU ALLERGIC
TO DOGS?

09:49.964 --> 09:52.883

I HAD A BULLDOG -- LUTHER.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.219
I NEVER WOULD'VE LET MY EX-WIFE
KEEP HIM

09:55.219 --> 09:57.179
IF I'D KNOWN
WHAT HE WAS WORTH.

09:57.179 --> 09:58.431

09:58.431 --> 10:01.225
START-UP-WISE, ALL YOU NEED IS
DOG FOOD AND WATER.

10:01.225 --> 10:03.311
I'M SURE IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THAT.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.687

YEAH.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.768
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THIS?

10:47.813 --> 10:51.067
[ SIGHS ]

10:51.067 --> 10:54.278
WE'RE VERY SORRY,
MR. MOLINA.

10:54.278 --> 10:57.740
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW YOUR NEPHEW?

10:57.740 --> 11:01.786
TWO DAYS AGO, WHEN THE I.N.S.
CAME TO TAKE HIM AWAY.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.747
IMMIGRATION AGENTS TOOK OSCAR
AWAY TWO DAYS AGO,

11:04.747 --> 11:06.666
AND HE HASN'T
BEEN SEEN SINCE?

11:06.666 --> 11:07.750
DID YOU REPORT IT?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.543
YES.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.380
THE I.N.S. SAID
THEY'D LOOK INTO IT.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.799
I DON'T HEAR BACK,
SO I CALLED THE POLICE

11:14.799 --> 11:17.385
WHEN OSCAR DOESN'T SHOW
FOR WORK YESTERDAY.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.012
THEY SAY, "MAKE A
MISSING-PERSONS REPORT."

11:20.012 --> 11:21.806
DID YOU GET A LOOK AT
THE AGENTS?

11:21.806 --> 11:23.599
I SAW THEM,
BUT I WAS NOT CLOSE.

11:23.599 --> 11:26.268
I HAVE A WORKER WHO WAS NEARBY
OSCAR AT THE TIME.

11:26.268 --> 11:27.812
CAN YOU GET HIM FOR US?

11:27.812 --> 11:29.814
HE'S HOME.
MY MEN ARE SCARED NOW.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.316
IF YOU COULD GET US HIS NUMBER,
WE'D APPRECIATE IT.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.536
I HAD A FRIEND WHO BRED
VIZSLAS.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.330
THEY'RE LIKE HIS CHILDREN,
SO I CAN IMAGINE HOW YOU FEEL.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.707
THANK YOU.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.334
DO YOU HAVE A DOG?

11:50.334 --> 11:51.252
HAD.

11:51.252 --> 11:54.797
A BLACK COCKER WITH A WHITE
CREST -- HANK.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.465
COCKERS ARE SWEETHEARTS.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.175
GOOD DISPOSITION,
GREAT WITH KIDS --

11:58.175 --> 11:59.969
A LOT LIKE BULLDOGS.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.681
I HOPE THEY'RE OKAY.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.976
I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE
BROUGHT UP DOGS.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.477
YOU WERE BEING KIND.

12:08.477 --> 12:11.480
THERE'S NEVER A REASON TO
APOLOGIZE FOR A KINDNESS.

12:11.480 --> 12:15.025
MY GOD, RAY, WHAT A NIGHTMARE.
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:15.025 --> 12:16.402
THEY BROKE IN
THE KITCHEN WINDOW

12:16.402 --> 12:17.862
RIGHT BY THE FIRE ESCAPE.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.322
TELL ME -- WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT IRON BARS?

12:20.322 --> 12:21.866
MAYBE NOW YOU'LL LISTEN TO ME
ON OCCASION.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.993

12:23.993 --> 12:27.621
DETECTIVES MEDAVOY AND JONES.
WE'RE WORKING THE INVESTIGATION.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.832
THEY ASKED IF I'D SEEN ANYONE
SUSPICIOUS

12:29.832 --> 12:31.917
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
AND I REMEMBERED THAT MAN

12:31.917 --> 12:33.502
THAT YOU SAW
BREAKING INTO THAT CAR.

12:33.502 --> 12:36.589
YOU THINK HE WENT FROM STEALING
STEREOS TO PUREBRED PUPPIES?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.132
Baldwin: WHEN DID YOU
SEE THIS HAPPEN?

12:38.132 --> 12:40.593
FOUR MONTHS AGO,
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.136
SO -- HIGHLY UNLIKELY.

12:42.136 --> 12:45.055
I ASSUME RAY TOLD YOU ABOUT
THE INQUIRIES.

12:45.055 --> 12:48.267
WE'VE CHECKED OUT EVERYONE WHO
INQUIRED ABOUT A PUPPY.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.686
THEY ALL HAVE ALIBIS
FOR THIS MORNING.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.062
THE PUPPIES ARE JUST GONE?

12:52.062 --> 12:54.815
WELL, THE NEXT STEP IS TO NOTIFY
AREA PET SHOPS OF THE THEFT

12:54.815 --> 12:57.359
AND HAVE YOU GUYS LOOK AT MUG
BOOKS OF LOCAL BURGLARS.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.945
UNLESS THERE'S ANYONE ELSE YOU
THINK MIGHT'VE DONE THIS.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.572
DID YOU TELL THEM ABOUT
LOIS DUNBAR?

13:01.572 --> 13:03.032
<i>NOW </i>WHO'S BEING UNLIKELY?

13:03.032 --> 13:03.657
EXCUSE ME.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.868
LOIS DUNBAR WOULD LIKE
NOTHING MORE

13:05.868 --> 13:07.995
THAN TO CLOSE US DOWN
FOR 6 MONTHS.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.830
SHE OWNS A PET STORE
IN THE VILLAGE --

13:09.830 --> 13:11.248

13:13.167 --> 13:14.919
SHE SELLS DOGS
FROM PUPPY MILLS,

13:14.919 --> 13:16.253
WHICH I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
STRICTLY AGAINST,

13:16.253 --> 13:18.172
BUT I DOUBT
SHE WOULD DO THIS.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.757
THEY NEARLY CAME TO BLOWS
OVER IT.

13:19.757 --> 13:23.385
WE HAD A DISCUSSION LAST WEEK
AT A SHOW IN VIRGINIA

13:23.385 --> 13:26.222
REGARDING AN EDITORIAL I HAD
WRITTEN IN<i> THE BULLDOGGER.</i>

13:26.222 --> 13:29.141
I THINK IT'S SICK TO PROMOTE
DOG-BREEDING TECHNIQUES

13:29.141 --> 13:31.727
THAT RESEMBLE VEAL FARMING --
WHICH I ALSO OBJECT TO.

13:31.727 --> 13:35.189
SO I PUT IT DOWN ON PAPER,
AND IT COST HER SOME BUSINESS.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.650
WELL, HAS MS. DUNBAR
EVER BEEN TO YOUR HOME?

13:37.650 --> 13:40.694
A FEW TIMES FOR
BULLDOG SOCIETY MEETINGS.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.613
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE'LL CHECK HER OUT.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.615
IN THE MEANTIME,
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND

13:44.615 --> 13:47.034
LOOKING AT THOSE MUG BOOKS,
WE'D APPRECIATE IT.

13:47.034 --> 13:49.245
JOHN, COULD YOU GET THEM
UP TO ANTI-CRIME?

13:49.245 --> 13:50.579
OH. SURE.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.459
I JUST DON'T SEE LOIS DOING
SOMETHING THIS CRUEL.

13:55.459 --> 13:56.919
BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN
A FANTASY LAND

13:56.919 --> 13:59.046
WHERE YOU THINK EVERYONE'S
GOOD AND KIND.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.632

IS FROM THE REAL WORLD.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.363
YEAH, WE SPOKE.
HOW YOU DOING, MARK?

14:24.363 --> 14:25.781
I LOOKED INTO IT,

14:25.781 --> 14:28.951
AND THERE'S NO REPORT ON ANYBODY
BEING TAKEN INTO CUSTODY

14:28.951 --> 14:30.911
FROM THE JOB SITE
TWO DAYS AGO --

14:30.911 --> 14:32.788
WHICH DOESN'T MEAN
WE DON'T HAVE AGENTS

14:32.788 --> 14:34.498
WHO COULD'VE BEEN
INVOLVED IN THIS.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.041
YOU HAVE A FILE ON THE DOA?

14:36.041 --> 14:37.209
NOTHING DOCUMENTED.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.546

HIS EMPLOYER?

14:40.546 --> 14:42.590
YEAH, WE'VE HAD DEALINGS
WITH MOLINA.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.717
HE HAS A HISTORY OF HIRING
ILLEGALS,

14:44.717 --> 14:47.136
AND WE'VE GOT AGENTS LEANING ON

14:52.975 --> 14:55.019
WE'VE HAD A SERIES OF COMPLAINTS
AGAINST THEM.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.813
LET'S SAY
"OVERLY AGGRESSIVE."

INVESTIGATION

15:00.190 --> 15:01.317
ONGOING ON THEM FOR THAT.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.152
PLUS, THEY'VE HAD
A LOT OF CONTACT

15:03.152 --> 15:04.445
WITH MOLINA CONSTRUCTION.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.364
I COULD SEE THEIR TACTICS
LEADING UP TO THIS.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.867

ABOUT PET STORES,

16:08.050 --> 16:10.636

MAYBE WE COULD JUST GET TO IT?

17:00.227 --> 17:02.688

TO THE WORK SITE

SOMETHING ELSE?

YOUR DESCRIPTION

PULLED A LABORER OFF THAT SITE
2 DAYS AGO.

17:20.330 --> 17:23.042
TODAY, HE ENDS UP STRANGLED IN
THE FRONT SEAT OF A STOLEN CAR.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.793
WE DIDN'T PULL NO ONE OFF
OF THAT JOB SITE,

17:24.793 --> 17:26.837
AND WE DIDN'T STRANGLE NO ONE
IN NO STOLEN CAR.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.048
WE PROBABLY WOULD'VE REMEMBERED
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.008
WHERE WERE YOU GUYS 2 DAYS AGO,
10:00 A.M.?

17:31.008 --> 17:32.760

17:40.517 --> 17:41.894
CAN ANYBODY VERIFY?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.563
DID KOLBERG PUT YOU UP TO THIS?
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

17:44.563 --> 17:46.899
WE GOT A DOA.
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

17:46.899 --> 17:51.361
2<i> HISPANIC </i>I.N.S. AGENTS WERE
LAST SEEN WITH THIS DOA.

ARE YOU REALLY WONDERING WHY
THE HELL WE BROUGHT YOU IN?

17:53.280 --> 17:55.365
NOW, DON'T COMPOUND IT
WITH THE COWBOY ATTITUDE.

17:55.365 --> 17:56.366
OKAY, OKAY, LOOK.

17:56.366 --> 17:59.161
ME AND MY PARTNER HAVE BEEN
HASSLED BY OUR OWN DEPARTMENT

17:59.161 --> 18:01.246
FOR THINGS WE DIDN'T DO --
MANY TIMES.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.625
SO MAYBE YOU'LL EXCUSE US IF
WE'RE SENSITIVE TO ACCUSATIONS.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.376
UNDERSTANDABLE.

18:06.376 --> 18:09.254
WE DIDN'T PULL NO ONE OFF THAT
SITE, AND WE DIDN'T KILL NOBODY.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.714
WE WERE ON SURVEILLANCE.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.549
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
OUR WORD FOR IT,

18:12.549 --> 18:14.218
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE CHECKED
IN ONCE OR TWICE,

18:14.218 --> 18:16.678
WE STAYED OFF THE RADIO FOR THE
MOST PART OF THAT MORNING.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.056
PAST THAT, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TALK TO OUR DELEGATE.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.475

YEAH.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.075
HOW DID IT GO?

18:38.075 --> 18:39.576
WE'RE GONNA TRY AND VERIFY
THEIR STORY.

18:39.576 --> 18:40.744
YOU LOCATE THAT WITNESS?

18:40.744 --> 18:43.205
YEAH. BOTH HIM AND
THE DOA'S UNCLE

18:43.205 --> 18:45.791
DIDN'T GIVE US MUCH PAST THE
I.N.S. AGENTS BEING HISPANIC,

18:45.791 --> 18:47.209
BUT THEY'LL LOOK AT PHOTOS.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.419
RUN A PHOTO ARRAY OF THE AGENTS
WHO WERE JUST HERE.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.004
YEAH, WE'LL DO THAT.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.673

18:53.966 --> 18:56.301
DON'T OVERLOOK THIS BEING
A SHAKEDOWN THAT WENT BAD.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.261
IT HAPPENS.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.389

IT COMES TO ILLEGAL ALIENS.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.057
NO DUE PROCESS, NOTHING.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.601
DOES THE WORD "ILLEGAL" MEAN
ANYTHING TO ANYBODY ANYMORE?

19:04.601 --> 19:05.978
YEAH, BUT COME ON.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.813
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE HERE
BUSTING THEIR HUMP

19:49.146 --> 19:52.482
IF SHE DOES, WE'LL ASK YOU TO
SIGN A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT.

19:52.482 --> 19:55.152
ANYTHING YOU HEAR OR SEE
STAYS IN THE APARTMENT.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.945
ANY QUESTIONS?

19:56.945 --> 19:58.280
I GOT IT.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.074
LET'S GET YOU INTRODUCED.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.868
SUSAN?

20:02.868 --> 20:04.494
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ IS HERE.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.210
SO, YOU'RE A POLICEMAN
LIKE EDDIE?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.879
ACTUALLY, ME AND EDDIE
ARE DETECTIVES.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.005
ARE YOU MARRIED?

20:15.005 --> 20:17.424
MY WIFE PASSED AWAY
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

20:17.424 --> 20:18.926
OH, I'M SORRY.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.260
MY HUSBAND, TOO --

20:20.260 --> 20:22.679
JULY 31, 1988.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.390
DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN?

20:25.390 --> 20:26.892
I HAVE ONE BOY.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.769
DONALD AND I
NEVER HAD CHILDREN.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.357
WELL, THEN.

20:33.357 --> 20:36.151
SO, I'LL BE
SEEING YOU TONIGHT.

20:36.151 --> 20:38.403
YEAH. I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.197
I DON'T LIKE COLOGNE.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.282
DID YOU TELL HIM
ABOUT THE COLOGNE?

20:42.282 --> 20:43.659
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.327
I DON'T WEAR IT,
SO IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.578
I SMELL COLOGNE.

20:49.623 --> 20:50.874
THAT'S AFTERSHAVE.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.417
WELL, IT'S DREADFUL.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.628
IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D ASK
THAT YOU DON'T WEAR IT.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.797
I'LL WORK SOMETHING OUT.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.507
SEE YOU TONIGHT!

21:04.221 --> 21:05.847
OKAY, WE'LL BE THERE.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.558
LET'S GO, PARTNER.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.939
LOVELY BEAST PET STORE JUST GOT
AN INQUIRY FROM A GUY

21:13.939 --> 21:16.024
LOOKING TO OFFLOAD
BULLDOG PUPS.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.277
ARE THEY STALLING HIM
AT THE STORE?

21:18.277 --> 21:21.613
NO. THEY TOLD HIM TO COME IN IN
AN HOUR WITH THE LITTER.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.825
YOU RUN PHOTO LINEUPS OF THE
AGENTS FOR THE 2 WITNESSES?

21:24.825 --> 21:27.536
THE WORKER
WHO SAW THEM CLOSEST

21:27.536 --> 21:29.288
SAID IT MOST LIKELY WASN'T ANY
IN THE ARRAY,

21:29.288 --> 21:31.039
BUT THE UNCLE POINTED OUT
AGENT RAMOS

21:31.039 --> 21:32.916
AND SAID HE MIGHT'VE BEEN
ONE OF THE GUYS.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.501
THE UNCLE KNOW
RAMOS AND TORRES

21:34.501 --> 21:36.128
FROM PAST RUN-INS AT HIS
BUSINESS?

21:36.128 --> 21:38.922
HE DID. SO, YEAH,
YOU GOTTA FACTOR THAT IN.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.382
BUT HE COULDN'T BE SURE
EITHER WAY.

21:40.382 --> 21:41.591
BOTH WITNESSES
WERE INTIMIDATED

21:41.591 --> 21:43.260
AT THE PROSPECT OF DEALING
WITH I.N.S.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.803
THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.180
YOU VERIFY THE AGENTS' STORY?

21:47.180 --> 21:49.850
YEAH. THEIR DISPATCH CONFIRMED
THAT TORRES AND RAMOS

21:49.850 --> 21:50.934
DID RADIO IN A COUPLE TIMES

21:50.934 --> 21:52.769
AROUND WHEN OUR DOA
GOT SNATCHED,

21:52.769 --> 21:55.439
BUT DISPATCH DIDN'T KNOW THE
LOCATION OF THE TRANSMISSION,

21:55.439 --> 21:57.566
SO IT DOESN'T MEAN THESE GUYS
WEREN'T INVOLVED.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.234
HAVEN'T CAUGHT THEM IN A LIE,
AT LEAST.

21:59.234 --> 22:01.194
GOT A COUPLE OF
FINGERPRINT HITS

22:01.194 --> 22:03.113
OFF THE STOLEN CAR
THE DOA WAS IN,

22:03.113 --> 22:05.198
ALL COMING BACK
TO A RAFAEL MERCADO --

22:05.198 --> 22:07.701
SECURITY GUARD AT SUPER BARGAINS
UP ON 120th STREET,

22:07.701 --> 22:08.744
SPANISH HARLEM.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.704
YOU AND ANDY TAKE A RIDE.
IF YOU NEED HELP, CALL.

22:10.704 --> 22:11.705
YEAH.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.220
I'M PICKING UP
A SECURITY JOB.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.305
YEAH?

22:28.305 --> 22:31.099
I'M LOOKING AT 15 YEARS OF PAID
EDUCATION FOR THEO.

22:31.099 --> 22:32.517
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND THAT

22:32.517 --> 22:34.186
AT THE BOTTOM OF A BOX OF
CRACKER JACKS.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.146
ONLY 2 NIGHTS A WEEK
AWAY FROM HIM.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.398
YOU'RE LOOKING AHEAD.
YOU'RE BEING A GOOD DAD.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.279
EXCUSE ME.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.740
SECURITY GUARD
RAFAEL MERCADO?

22:50.660 --> 22:51.953
THANKS.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.250
HI.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.127
TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

22:59.127 --> 23:00.212
SURE.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.588
GET HIM. GET HIM!

23:05.884 --> 23:07.219
AAAH!

23:07.219 --> 23:09.054
Junior: YOU OKAY?

23:09.054 --> 23:10.555
GO! GO!

23:22.984 --> 23:24.820
MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!

23:24.820 --> 23:26.488
MOVE!

23:33.620 --> 23:34.996
YOU GOT HIM?

23:34.996 --> 23:37.124
YEAH. YOU OKAY, ANDY?

23:37.124 --> 23:39.418
YEAH. NOW LET'S GET HIM
OUT OF HERE.

23:47.217 --> 23:51.054
WELL...IT'S CONCEIVABLE YOU
COULD MAKE THAT MUCH, BUT --

23:51.054 --> 23:53.682
HEY, KAREN. WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TRY ONE OF THESE?

23:53.682 --> 23:55.892
LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK.

23:55.892 --> 23:58.353
WHAT A PRETTY LITTLE DOG.

23:58.353 --> 23:59.980
WHAT'S HER NAME?

23:59.980 --> 24:01.898
<i>HIS </i>NAME IS JOHNNY.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.901
Whew.

24:04.901 --> 24:09.573
SO, THE START-UP COST OF
BREEDING BULLDOG PUPPIES

24:09.573 --> 24:11.158
IS $3,000

24:11.158 --> 24:13.285
WITH A POTENTIAL
ANNUAL RETURN OF $50,000.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.162
DIDN'T ASK.

24:15.162 --> 24:18.832
ESSENTIALLY THAT 3 GRAND IS JUST
THE COST OF THE BITCH.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.626
THE SERVICES OF THE MALE
YOU HIRE OUT FOR.

24:21.626 --> 24:25.297
AND THEN YOU JUST INTRODUCE THEM
AND PUT THEM IN A ROOM

24:25.297 --> 24:28.300
WITH MOOD LIGHTING
AND A BARRY WHITE RECORD?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.551
[ CHUCKLES ] NO. NO, NO.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.386
THEY DON'T MATE WELL --
TOO MUCH BELLY.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.054
THE BITCH NEEDS TO BE
INSEMINATED.

24:33.054 --> 24:35.098
ARTIFICIALLY, HUH?

24:35.098 --> 24:37.225
WHAT'S THE PROCESS THERE?

24:37.225 --> 24:40.687
THE SPERM IS INTRODUCED WITH
A DEVICE -- LIKE A DROPPER.

24:40.687 --> 24:43.648
HOW DO YOU GET THE SPERM
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

24:43.648 --> 24:45.901
YOU DRAW IT OUT
WITH A SYRINGE?

24:45.901 --> 24:48.695
YOU PUT A RECEPTACLE DEVICE
AROUND THE MALE

24:48.695 --> 24:51.823
AND -- YOU KNOW.
IT'S A MANUAL DEAL.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.992
MANUAL?

24:53.992 --> 24:57.287
LIKE...LIKE...

24:57.287 --> 24:59.372
MANIPULATION, YEAH.

24:59.372 --> 25:02.584
SO THAT'S WHAT ALL
THE TAIL-WAGGING'S ABOUT.

25:06.421 --> 25:09.090
ARE YOU LARRY?
I SURE AM.

25:09.090 --> 25:11.009
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

25:11.009 --> 25:12.177
TOM.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.470
WHAT YOU GOT
IN THE BOX THERE, TOM?

25:13.470 --> 25:14.763
PUPPIES.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.224
AW.
WHERE'D YOU GET THEM FROM?

25:17.224 --> 25:18.683
FROM MY DOG.

25:18.683 --> 25:22.103
YEAH? WE'RE GONNA
BRING YOU IN AND VERIFY THAT.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.356
MY DOG'S OUT OF TOWN.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.399
A LITTLE DOGGY VACATION?

25:26.399 --> 25:28.693
SOMEBODY TOOK MY DOG
OUT OF TOWN.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.153
RIGHT.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.740
COME ON.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.628
I USED TO BE A COP...

25:46.628 --> 25:48.505
IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.715
DID YOU RUN AWAY
WHEN YOU WERE A COP, TOO?

25:50.715 --> 25:53.093
MY TOURIST VISA EXPIRED.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE I.N.S.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.803
HOW LONG WERE YOU A COP?

25:54.803 --> 25:55.804
FIVE YEAR.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.265
YEAH? TRY AND JOIN UP
OUT HERE?

25:58.265 --> 25:59.891
NO HIGH-SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

25:59.891 --> 26:03.270
I TELL THEM WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT THE STREET.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.939
THAT'S 10 TIMES MORE THAN
A DAMN HIGH-SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.941
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT OSCAR MOLINA?

26:07.941 --> 26:09.359
I DON'T.

26:09.359 --> 26:12.571
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
A JOB SITE AT 10th AND "C"?

26:12.571 --> 26:13.405
NOTHING.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.074
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT A STOLEN
CAR TAKEN OUT OF BROOKLYN?

26:18.368 --> 26:19.703
YOU PROBABLY NEVER WERE
A COP.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.454
WHY WOULD YOU SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

26:21.454 --> 26:23.748
WE'VE GOT YOUR FINGERPRINTS
ON THAT STOLEN CAR.

26:23.748 --> 26:26.167
MAYBE A FRIEND OF MINE GIVE ME
A RIDE IN ONE THAT'S STOLEN.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.586
BACK TO OSCAR MOLINA.

26:28.837 --> 26:29.838
I SEE HIM AROUND.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.756
YEAH? WHERE?

26:31.756 --> 26:33.091
PEOPLE POINT HIM OUT.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.635
THAT'S THE GUY WHO HAS SEX
WITH CHILDREN.

26:35.635 --> 26:37.429
I STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.348
HE MOLEST ANYBODY CLOSE
TO YOU?

26:40.348 --> 26:42.058
IF HE DID,
WE COULD UNDERSTAND

26:42.058 --> 26:44.269
HOW THAT WOULD MAKE YOU
WANT TO HURT HIM.

26:44.269 --> 26:47.647
I TELL YOU WHAT I HEARD.
HE RAPES KIDS.

26:47.647 --> 26:49.899
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY
WHO WANTED TO HURT HIM?

26:49.899 --> 26:53.695
YOU SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH YOU GUYS HERE.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.280
BACK HOME,
A MOLESTER IS KILLED.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.783
THAT IS GOD MAKING EVERYTHING
TAKE CARE OF ITSELF.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.827
IT'S NOT FOR THE POLICE
TO WORRY ABOUT.

27:00.827 --> 27:03.538
WHY WORRY ABOUT IT?

27:08.001 --> 27:09.127
HOW'D YOU MAKE OUT?

27:09.127 --> 27:10.795
HE'S PLAYING GAMES.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.173
DID YOU RUN A PHOTO LINEUP
ON THIS GUY?

27:13.173 --> 27:16.176
A WORKER PICKED HIM OUT
AS ONE OF THE I.N.S. AGENTS.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.428
BUT THE UNCLE SAYS NO WAY
HE WAS ONE OF THEM.

27:18.428 --> 27:20.555
HE WAS FURTHER AWAY
THAN ANY WORKERS.

27:20.555 --> 27:22.724
WE WENT OVER IT.
HE'S SAYING NO WAY.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.726
THIS GUY SAYS THE DOA
IS A KNOWN PEDOPHILE.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.853
IF IT'S TRUE,
THAT OPENS IT UP.

27:26.853 --> 27:29.564
THE DOA WORKED FOR HIS UNCLE,
RIGHT? LIVED WITH HIM?

27:29.564 --> 27:31.524
YEAH.

27:31.524 --> 27:33.902
THE UNCLE HAVE KIDS?
DIDN'T GET THAT FAR.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.487
GO BY HIS HOME.
LOOK INTO IT.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.905
YOU AND RITA.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.156
ALL RIGHT.

27:46.581 --> 27:47.832
YOU WATCH.

27:47.832 --> 27:50.460
ANY OPENING,
HE'S BRINGING HIS PEOPLE IN.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.629
ISN'T THAT TRADITION
ON THE JOB?

27:52.629 --> 27:55.632
THEY DIDN'T CALL IT
IRISH WELFARE FOR NOTHING.

27:55.632 --> 27:58.635
YES, ANDY. YES, ANDY.
YES, ANDY.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.887
THAT BALL-BREAKER.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.935
THANKS.
ANYTIME.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.853
EVERYTHING WORK OUT
WITH THE DOGS?

28:08.853 --> 28:12.273
ACTUALLY, TOM,
WE HIT A SNAG.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.652
WHERE WERE YOU THIS MORNING
AROUND 8:00?

28:15.652 --> 28:17.904
MY APARTMENT.
WHAT KIND OF SNAG?

28:17.904 --> 28:20.699
ANYONE WITH YOU?
JUST THE DOGGIES.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.410
EVER BEEN
TO 1791 SPRING STREET?

28:23.410 --> 28:24.703
DOUBT IT.

28:24.703 --> 28:28.039
THE GROCER ACROSS THE STREET SAW
A GUY LOOKING LIKE YOU

28:28.039 --> 28:31.376
LEAVE 1791 SPRING STREET AT 8:00
HOLDING A BIG BOX.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.670
AFTER HE POSITIVELY
IDENTIFIES YOU, TOM,

28:33.670 --> 28:36.715
YOU'LL BE FACING
A BURGLARY CHARGE.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.633
THIS IS UNREAL.

28:38.633 --> 28:41.761
WHAT LED YOU
TO THE PUPPIES?

28:41.761 --> 28:44.097
A GUY WHO COMES INTO THIS CLUB
I GO TO.

28:44.097 --> 28:47.100
I DON'T EVEN LIKE DOGS,
BUT HE OFFERS ME 1,000 BUCKS.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.476
WHO'S THE GUY?

28:48.476 --> 28:50.562
CARTER SOMETHING.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.563
LYNCH?

28:51.563 --> 28:52.772
THAT'S IT.

28:52.772 --> 28:55.692
HE GAVE ME A KEY,
TOLD ME WHERE TO GO,

28:55.692 --> 28:59.154
SAID TO MAKE SURE I BUST IN BY
THE FIRE ESCAPE, EASY GRAND.

28:59.154 --> 29:02.490
TWO MORE, YOU COULD
HAVE YOURSELF A BUSINESS.

29:02.490 --> 29:05.410
WHAT WAS THE PLAN FOR
AFTER HE TOOK THE DOGS?

29:05.410 --> 29:07.328
I WAS SUPPOSED TO KEEP THEM
THE WEEK,

29:07.328 --> 29:09.038
AND THEN HE WAS GONNA
GET THEM.

29:09.038 --> 29:10.957
WHAT MADE YOU SELL THEM?

29:10.957 --> 29:13.918
I JUST COULDN'T TAKE THOSE
LITTLE NIGHTMARES ANYMORE.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.463
I COULDN'T REACH CARTER,
SO I FOUND THIS PET SHOP

29:16.463 --> 29:18.381
AND ASKED HOW MUCH
THEY PAID FOR PUPPIES.

29:18.381 --> 29:21.176
WHEN YOU SAY YOU COULDN'T TAKE
THOSE NIGHTMARES ANYMORE,

29:21.176 --> 29:22.469
WHAT DID YOU MEAN?

29:22.469 --> 29:24.721
IN THE SPACE OF FIVE HOURS,

29:24.721 --> 29:29.642
I HAD LIQUID DOG GRAVY
ON MY FLOOR, ON MY RUG,

29:29.642 --> 29:31.144
EVEN IN MY SHOE.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.146
YOU KNOW HOW PUPPIES ARE
CONSTANTLY YIPPING?

29:33.146 --> 29:34.898
MULTIPLY THAT BY FIVE

29:34.898 --> 29:37.609
AND THEN COVER
EVERYTHING YOU OWN

29:37.609 --> 29:41.070
IN THE MOST FOUL-SMELLING URINE
AND FECES,

29:41.070 --> 29:43.782
AND YOU'LL HAVE SOME IDEA OF
WHAT MY MORNING WAS LIKE.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.326
EASY MONEY.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.745
WRITE DOWN
ABOUT THE BURGLARY.

29:58.505 --> 29:59.756
YES?

29:59.756 --> 30:02.801
THIS RENALDO MOLINA'S
APARTMENT? YOU ARE?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.552
I'M MARIA, HIS WIFE.

30:04.552 --> 30:06.888
DETECTIVES ORTIZ
AND McDOWELL.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.515

41:09.508 --> 41:12.553
YOU ARE RUINING
MY EVENING.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.638
NOW, GET OVER HERE
AND SING WITH ME!

41:14.638 --> 41:18.517
LISTEN, MRS. HORNBY, WE BETTER
GET A FEW THINGS CLEAR.

41:18.517 --> 41:21.395
I WANT YOU TO SING. HOW MUCH
MORE CLEAR DO I HAVE TO BE?

41:21.395 --> 41:23.147
I TOOK THIS JOB
TO PROTECT YOU.

41:23.147 --> 41:25.065
AND IF WE GOT A LONG, GREAT.

41:25.065 --> 41:27.610
BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
ANOTHER MAID OR A BABYSITTER.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.278
EDDIE DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT.

41:29.278 --> 41:31.822
I'M NOT EDDIE. I DON'T SING,
AND I DON'T FETCH.

41:31.822 --> 41:34.533
YOU ARE MAKING ME VERY UNHAPPY
RIGHT NOW!

41:34.533 --> 41:35.743
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.411
I'M GONNA GO SIT
BY THE DOOR.

41:37.411 --> 41:39.747
I'M GONNA WAIT FOR YOUR MAID
TO COME BACK,

41:39.747 --> 41:41.332
AND WHEN SHE DOES,
I'M OUT OF HERE.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.917
TOMORROW YOU CAN ADVERTISE

41:42.917 --> 41:45.711
FOR A SINGING, FETCHING
MANSERVANT, YOU GOT THAT?

41:45.711 --> 41:48.005
FINE!

41:58.682 --> 42:01.393
He fell asleep watching TV.

42:04.980 --> 42:06.649
MNH-MNH.

42:06.649 --> 42:08.317
CAN YOU SLIDE OUT?

42:14.740 --> 42:16.325
DADDY?

42:16.325 --> 42:19.203
YEAH, BUDDY.
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

42:19.203 --> 42:20.538
YOU JUST SIT TIGHT.

42:26.794 --> 42:28.837
I MADE HIM A LUNCH FOR SCHOOL
TOMORROW.

42:28.837 --> 42:30.130
IT'S IN THE FRIDGE.

42:30.130 --> 42:31.840
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.300
I JUST MADE A SANDWICH.

42:33.300 --> 42:36.512
ALSO, HE SAID HE WAS ALLOWED
TO WATCH TV

42:36.512 --> 42:37.638
WHILE HE DOES HIS HOMEWORK.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.390
NO. HE'S PLAYING YOU.

42:39.390 --> 42:40.849
I FIGURED,

42:40.849 --> 42:43.769
SO I HELD HIM OFF
UNTIL HE FINISHED.

42:43.769 --> 42:45.980
HOW'S THE SECURITY JOB?

42:45.980 --> 42:48.566
THIS WOMAN IS A NUT CASE.
I'M NOT GOING BACK.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.859
WELL,
IF THERE'S ANY CHANGE

42:50.859 --> 42:53.862
OR SOMETHING COMES UP
AND JOHN'S BUSY,

42:53.862 --> 42:55.573
I'D BE HAPPY TO SIT AGAIN.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.491
THEN FOR THE FUTURE,

42:57.491 --> 42:59.827
IT'S BETTER IF YOU HAVE HIM
GO TO SLEEP IN HIS OWN BED.

42:59.827 --> 43:01.453
HE CAN BE A HARD TRANSFER.

43:01.453 --> 43:04.373
DONE.

43:04.373 --> 43:07.126
Oh, uh...

43:07.126 --> 43:09.962
DOES HE GET
ONE SANDWICH OR TWO?

43:09.962 --> 43:11.797
ONE.

43:11.797 --> 43:14.633
HE SAID TWO. I GAVE HIM ONE
AND ONLY ONE PUDDING.

43:14.633 --> 43:15.759
THERE YOU GO.

43:15.759 --> 43:17.177
GOOD NIGHT, ANDY.

43:17.177 --> 43:19.597
AND I'M SERIOUS. ANYTIME YOU
WANT ME TO WATCH HIM...

43:19.597 --> 43:20.931
GOOD NIGHT.

43:44.079 --> 43:46.999
