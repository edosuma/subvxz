WEBVTT

01:27.338 --> 01:28.798
Tackle him, Chai.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.050
You can do it, Chai.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.360
Come on, Chai. Let's go eat.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.338
Hey Prem.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.550
Your mother bought a
SpongeBob cake for your birthday party.

02:14.969 --> 02:17.513
SpongeBob cake for a little boy!

02:19.265 --> 02:20.808
Stop giving me a hard time.

02:23.018 --> 02:25.104
Guess where we're going?

02:27.523 --> 02:30.818
Before your party, let's go to the cave.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.989
Yeah, the cave for the birthday boy!

02:37.116 --> 02:39.743
I'll race you to the park.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.162
Then I better go with you.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.373
We have to go quickly, it'll be dark soon.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.879
Coach, my dad's cooking for the party.

02:50.129 --> 02:52.006
I promised to help.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.507
You're a good son.

02:53.757 --> 02:54.967
See you at the party.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.304
Okay, bye. See you at 7pm.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.542
Go! Go!

04:11.877 --> 04:12.962
Hey, Arm!

04:16.382 --> 04:18.008
Go!

05:46.096 --> 05:47.973
Go, walk slowly.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.269
This is always the best part.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.009
Keep going!

06:47.199 --> 06:50.577
I told Prem to come straight home after practice.

06:54.540 --> 06:59.419
Well, if they stop over tell them
we're waiting to start the party.

07:06.218 --> 07:09.012
Sorry I'm late.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.848
The shop got really busy.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.308
You're Chai's mom, right?

07:15.269 --> 07:16.103
That's right.

07:17.271 --> 07:21.275
I want to watch the games
but I'm always working.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.573
Looks like they did go to the cave.

07:28.615 --> 07:29.741
All of them?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.785
In this rain?

07:31.869 --> 07:33.745
It wasn't raining earlier.

07:36.165 --> 07:38.041
Excuse me.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.669
Shouldn't we drive to the cave and get them?

07:40.752 --> 07:43.005
They'll get soaked riding back.

07:43.088 --> 07:47.384
What are they thinking
staying in the cave this late.

07:49.261 --> 07:55.934
Heavy rain is forecast in Northern Thailand
as the monsoon season starts early.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.103
Monsoon?

07:58.187 --> 08:00.355
That usually starts in July.

08:00.439 --> 08:02.774
It can't be the monsoon.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.736
That cave floods every year.

08:39.728 --> 08:40.604
That's Chai's bike!

08:41.688 --> 08:44.358
We're the parents who called ahead.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.525
Have you seen the boys?

08:45.609 --> 08:47.861
We've looked and can't go any further.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.404
The cave's flooding.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.073
We called the authorities.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.534
It's flooding. How can the boys get out?

08:54.618 --> 08:56.578
I've already asked for help.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.330
Please wait.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.123
Let's go in and get them.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.501
Calm down and wait for help.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.179
Chai! Can you hear me?

09:20.894 --> 09:22.479
I just started my dinner.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.231
Sorry, Governor.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.068
Have the SEALs been deployed?

09:28.902 --> 09:30.737
They're already on the ground, sir.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.387
This is Vern Unsworth.

09:57.306 --> 09:59.808
I'm the Governor of the province.
You are?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.687
Captain Arnont Sureewong.

10:04.438 --> 10:05.772
Navy SEALs, sir.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.650
Move everything to the tent.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.694
I need an update.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.700
My men will enter with scuba gear.

10:20.037 --> 10:23.248
This man lives nearby, sir. He knows the cave.

10:23.832 --> 10:24.958
Hello.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.020
Let's go.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.067
Maybe I could find you something to eat, sir?

10:50.942 --> 10:52.069
That would be kind.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.780
This could be a long night.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.318
Start laying guideline from here.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.465
It's a deep cave,

11:55.549 --> 11:56.800
several kilometers long,

11:57.384 --> 11:59.761
with some narrow passages.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.805
If the boys have gone a long way in,

12:01.888 --> 12:04.099
it could take several more hours.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.893
But I have every confidence in the Navy SEALs.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.125
Hello, Governor.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.130
The SEALs are coming.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.056
We couldn't find the boys.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.977
We hit a flash flood.

12:59.571 --> 13:02.073
There's no visibility or space to maneuver.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.540
The currents are too strong and shifting.

13:40.904 --> 13:44.866
It's been two days since the Wild Boars
football team got trapped in the cave.

13:45.158 --> 13:49.162
Thai authorities have activated
over one hundred government agencies.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.416
In an astonishing nationwide
effort to rescue the boys,

13:53.500 --> 13:57.379
volunteers have also joined the effort
pumping water out of the cave.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.047
There is mounting pressure on officials

13:59.130 --> 14:02.259
to help these boys by any means necessary.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.687
Minister.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.438
Governor.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.566
Bring me up to speed.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.484
Pumping has begun, Minister.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.361
I know that.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.655
With the largest pumps in the region.

14:24.614 --> 14:25.949
I ordered them myself.

14:26.658 --> 14:30.662
So far the divers have been unable
to get through as the water is so high.

14:30.745 --> 14:33.790
The flooded sections are very
narrow and difficult to navigate.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.125
The current is very strong.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.418
You haven't found the boys?

14:37.043 --> 14:39.087
And you don't know where they are?

14:39.170 --> 14:41.381
Or even if they're alive?

14:41.464 --> 14:44.050
I know you were to be transferred next week

14:44.134 --> 14:47.262
but you'll remain here as Governor until this is done.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.175
They tell me you're the guy
who knows this mountain best.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.134
Sure.

15:26.217 --> 15:31.348
You know the cave is flooded.
There are boys trapped in there.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.891
Who are you?

15:33.433 --> 15:36.811
Thanet Natisri,
I'm a water engineer from Bangkok.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.022
The government sent for you?

15:39.105 --> 15:42.525
No, I just came, like everyone else.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.779
There's no time to wait for help from the officials.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.658
The rain water is flooding into the cave.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.993
It's coming from above, not below.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.079
We have to stop it from getting in.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.998
I need to find all the sinkholes and divert them.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.401
I know many like this.

18:29.359 --> 18:34.572
This is a massive rescue operation with over a
thousand volunteers from all over the world.

18:35.156 --> 18:39.410
Thai volunteers are joined by volunteers from China,

18:40.078 --> 18:44.082
Japan, America, Britain and Australia.

18:57.512 --> 19:00.682
In order to reduce the water levels,

19:00.765 --> 19:02.141
Thai military and volunteers

19:02.225 --> 19:04.853
are working around the clock
to pump water from the cave.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.814
Due to worsening conditions inside the cave,

19:07.897 --> 19:10.608
all rescue dive efforts have been put on hold.

19:54.360 --> 20:00.325
In World Cup Group H,
Poland beat Japan by one goal to nil.

20:38.446 --> 20:39.614
The cave is closed.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.151
Sir, look at them.

21:17.235 --> 21:18.695
They're amateurs.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.697
They'll never survive the currents in the cave.

23:23.319 --> 23:26.239
I'll follow.
I need a few more minutes to fix this pump.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.087
The water level's getting high.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.588
It's almost running.

29:13.377 --> 29:16.964
The T-junction is the same
location my team got to.

29:17.047 --> 29:19.592
That's as far as they laid their line.

29:20.301 --> 29:22.344
I sent for them on good advice.

29:23.512 --> 29:26.015
I'm pursuing every avenue open to me.

29:26.807 --> 29:27.683
Yes, Governor.

29:28.476 --> 29:31.979
I'll let you know when the
rescue operation can be resumed.

30:54.603 --> 30:57.481
Life threatening infections are a concern.

30:57.565 --> 31:04.196
We need to remember that every breath
they take increases carbon dioxide levels.

31:04.780 --> 31:08.742
As oxygen decreases,
physical exertion becomes more taxing.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.375
Right here, that's their tent.

31:23.424 --> 31:24.800
Hi, Captain.

31:27.720 --> 31:28.846
You're not at work?

31:28.929 --> 31:30.389
I took a vacation.

31:32.016 --> 31:33.267
So you broke free?

31:34.810 --> 31:37.187
I got bored of watching you on the news.

31:37.271 --> 31:39.148
Hey team, this is Saman.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.026
Saman's one of us.
He served under me for ten years.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.861
We chased pirates together.

31:45.154 --> 31:46.905
I brought my old scuba gear.

31:46.989 --> 31:48.240
I want to help.

31:48.324 --> 31:49.575
Welcome.

31:51.577 --> 31:52.411
Excuse me!

31:54.622 --> 31:56.290
Can I talk with you please?

31:58.917 --> 31:59.793
Sir,

32:00.878 --> 32:02.212
my boy is in the cave

32:03.172 --> 32:04.506
and now it's flooding.

32:05.466 --> 32:07.843
I don't know if my son is alive or dead.

32:08.636 --> 32:10.387
All I ask from you, sir,

32:12.181 --> 32:14.516
is to bring me his body.

34:19.975 --> 34:22.436
We need to build dams for every sinkhole.

34:29.443 --> 34:32.070
Seems like he just showed up on his own, sir.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.449
The men working with him are local villagers.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.535
I don't believe we've met.

34:43.999 --> 34:46.418
I live in Illinois, but I'm from Bangkok.

34:46.502 --> 34:48.420
I was in Bangkok when I heard the news.

34:48.504 --> 34:50.964
I rounded up some volunteers and here we are.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.053
Tell me how you can help.

34:58.555 --> 34:59.389
Of course.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.684
There's a network of mountain streams

35:02.768 --> 35:06.188
carrying water through all the
fissures and cracks into the cave.

35:06.271 --> 35:08.524
That's what's creating the strong currents.

35:09.066 --> 35:13.028
If we find a way to divert these streams,
the water level will drop.

35:13.654 --> 35:14.571
I thought that's why we're pumping
water out of the cave below.

35:16.657 --> 35:18.617
No, sir. Those pumps are useless.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.620
The cave is at the bottom,
water will keep running in from above.

35:21.703 --> 35:23.455
Can you stop that?

35:24.748 --> 35:25.582
We are trying.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.253
But there's a price to pay.

35:39.221 --> 35:41.139
You've all been in the cave.

35:41.849 --> 35:44.601
You know the water comes
in from the mountain.

35:44.685 --> 35:47.271
Now we want to divert the water

35:47.354 --> 35:48.814
down the side of the mountain,

35:49.815 --> 35:51.066
away from the cave,

35:51.650 --> 35:54.152
onto your fields.

36:02.452 --> 36:03.829
We will lose our crop?

36:05.455 --> 36:06.498
Yes.

36:06.582 --> 36:08.542
This will save the boys?

36:11.003 --> 36:13.088
Honestly, I can't promise anything.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.010
But it will give the boys a chance.

36:38.655 --> 36:39.489
Agreed.

36:40.282 --> 36:41.116
For the boys.

38:16.837 --> 38:19.965
I asked if Kruba could come and he's here already.

39:17.898 --> 39:19.608
Can you take these to Kruba?

39:24.154 --> 39:25.030
Excuse me.

39:26.281 --> 39:28.492
Kruba, please could you bless these for me?

39:43.757 --> 39:44.716
Thank you.

39:49.846 --> 39:54.267
I'm told the pumps are working
and the rain has stopped.

39:54.351 --> 39:55.852
When can the SEALs go in again?

39:55.936 --> 39:58.730
For the waters to recede,

39:58.814 --> 40:00.315
at least twenty-four hours.

40:02.442 --> 40:04.694
The British divers are ready to go in.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.323
Our team is preparing.

40:09.241 --> 40:11.451
I think it's too risky to let them in now.

40:11.535 --> 40:15.789
They're amongst the best in the
world at diving in these conditions.

40:15.872 --> 40:17.415
Let's use them as scouts

40:17.999 --> 40:19.251
and see what happens?

40:20.877 --> 40:21.711
Sir,

40:22.254 --> 40:24.589
the Minister requests an update.

44:32.962 --> 44:34.130
Thank you.

44:38.760 --> 44:41.554
Thank you.

46:12.854 --> 46:16.274
I offer my most sincere apologies
for leading the boys into danger.

46:16.357 --> 46:20.403
It's not true! Coach helped us!
We love our coach! He's the best!

49:19.248 --> 49:20.875
The old men found the boys!

49:30.718 --> 49:31.969
They found the boys!

49:35.807 --> 49:36.849
They're alive!

49:50.488 --> 49:51.698
They found the boys.

49:52.240 --> 49:53.408
Everyone's alive.

49:53.491 --> 49:54.534
They're safe.

49:54.617 --> 49:55.785
Everyone's alive?

50:04.711 --> 50:06.003
They found the boys!

50:06.671 --> 50:07.880
They found the boys!

55:00.965 --> 55:01.966
Sorry.

55:03.175 --> 55:04.176
It's okay.

55:09.765 --> 55:11.267
When will they come back?

55:11.851 --> 55:13.477
Maybe they won't come.

55:17.023 --> 55:19.942
They'll come when they're ready.
We must be ready.

55:20.735 --> 55:23.446
Fear is created in our minds.

55:27.533 --> 55:28.534
Close your eyes.

55:36.083 --> 55:37.710
Let your mind be at peace.

55:40.755 --> 55:43.382
Feel the air you breathe in and out.

55:50.431 --> 55:51.682
Breathe in.

55:53.059 --> 55:54.393
Breathe out.

55:54.977 --> 55:56.062
Slowly.

55:59.356 --> 56:04.153
We're standing by at the
basecamp of the rescue mission.

56:04.236 --> 56:06.781
Rescuers are attempting to find
alternative ways to reach the cave.

56:06.864 --> 56:12.578
Experts believe the boys will never survive
three months of monsoon rains and flooding.

56:15.748 --> 56:18.959
Still using the same
Scubapro regulator from my time.

57:40.332 --> 57:41.333
Let's pack up.

59:41.412 --> 59:42.454
Navy SEALs.

59:48.210 --> 59:50.337
Not bad for eleven days without food.

59:50.838 --> 59:53.340
The boys in the north, they're tough.

59:54.758 --> 59:55.718
We have a little food

59:56.385 --> 59:57.678
and batteries.

1:00:03.434 --> 1:00:04.476
Two bites each.

1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:07.021
We must save them for later.

1:00:16.363 --> 1:00:17.406
I'm a doctor.

1:00:18.157 --> 1:00:19.867
I'm going to check the boys.

1:00:24.663 --> 1:00:25.706
What's your name?

1:00:25.789 --> 1:00:26.665
Arm.

1:00:29.710 --> 1:00:30.836
You're very strong.

1:00:48.479 --> 1:00:50.564
The oxygen in the cave is below twenty.

1:00:55.569 --> 1:00:57.696
We only have enough air
for one of us to get back.

1:00:57.780 --> 1:01:00.240
We used more tanks than we planned on.

1:01:01.950 --> 1:01:03.952
Take it and return to base.

1:01:05.162 --> 1:01:07.915
Report the oxygen meter
is close to the red zone.

1:01:12.336 --> 1:01:14.046
You understand the situation?

1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:21.512
We're staying here with you.

1:01:33.190 --> 1:01:34.608
Bring Jay some water.

1:01:35.442 --> 1:01:36.318
He's cramping!

1:01:53.252 --> 1:01:57.464
Now you see why the Minister left me in charge.

1:02:05.139 --> 1:02:07.349
The Navy SEALs have reached the boys.

1:02:08.350 --> 1:02:10.269
They will support the boys,

1:02:11.728 --> 1:02:14.523
as we prepare for next stage of the rescue.

1:02:16.483 --> 1:02:18.235
I give my word to everyone,

1:02:19.069 --> 1:02:21.822
the boys will come out safely.

1:02:40.466 --> 1:02:41.800
Governor, sir.

1:02:41.884 --> 1:02:43.427
Excuse me, Governor.

1:02:43.510 --> 1:02:45.095
How can I help?

1:02:45.804 --> 1:02:47.514
Can I speak with the Governor please?

1:02:47.598 --> 1:02:51.185
The governor is busy.
I can help you.

1:02:52.853 --> 1:02:56.356
Our families are Shan.
We don't have ID cards.

1:02:56.440 --> 1:02:58.275
Will they still help our boys?

1:02:58.358 --> 1:02:59.401
Will they rescue them too?

1:03:07.367 --> 1:03:11.914
Don't worry, your son will be rescued
from the cave with all the others.

1:03:11.997 --> 1:03:15.417
You should be proud of your son.
He's been very patient.

1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:17.794
Governor!

1:03:19.171 --> 1:03:21.131
It's been twelve days already.

1:03:21.215 --> 1:03:23.717
Inside it's dark and cold with no food.

1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:25.761
How long can the boys be patient?

1:03:25.844 --> 1:03:27.471
When are you getting them out?

1:03:27.554 --> 1:03:30.140
There are three SEALs staying with the boys.

1:03:30.224 --> 1:03:32.559
We're planning to send food in.

1:03:33.268 --> 1:03:34.770
I understand how you must feel.

1:03:35.896 --> 1:03:37.272
How can you understand?

1:03:38.690 --> 1:03:40.484
Is your son going to die?

1:07:35.260 --> 1:07:36.636
Paper to write letters.

1:07:40.599 --> 1:07:41.433
It's strange.

1:07:42.476 --> 1:07:45.270
The parents thanking me
for taking care of their children.

1:07:46.480 --> 1:07:48.273
I thought they would blame me.

1:07:50.859 --> 1:07:52.360
No one blames you, Coach.

1:11:17.107 --> 1:11:20.193
As the oxygen level decreases in the cave,

1:11:20.276 --> 1:11:23.697
Thai Navy SEALs are doubling their
efforts to help the trapped boys.

1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:27.367
The air we breathe contains about
twenty-one percent oxygen.

1:11:27.450 --> 1:11:30.620
The level in the cave is less than sixteen percent.

1:11:32.163 --> 1:11:32.998
Saman.

1:11:33.081 --> 1:11:33.915
You okay?

1:11:35.709 --> 1:11:37.460
Thanks for letting me take wetsuits to the boys.

1:11:38.044 --> 1:11:39.337
I'm happy you could lend a hand.

1:11:40.255 --> 1:11:41.089
I'll help.

1:11:57.647 --> 1:11:58.481
Thanks Saman.

1:16:44.475 --> 1:16:45.852
As for Saman's funeral,

1:16:45.935 --> 1:16:49.147
the government will arrange
a funeral with full honors.

1:20:35.873 --> 1:20:37.208
Don't write this down.

1:22:10.009 --> 1:22:13.304
The operation may now proceed.

1:22:17.767 --> 1:22:18.601
Yes, Minister.

1:23:13.072 --> 1:23:15.658
Your volunteering and effort is critical.

1:23:16.450 --> 1:23:20.413
The faster the waterways can be diverted
before the monsoons return,

1:23:20.496 --> 1:23:22.915
the more time we can buy for the boys.

1:23:22.998 --> 1:23:25.459
They're telling us the dams are helping.

1:23:25.543 --> 1:23:28.629
It makes it possible for the
divers to reach the boys.

1:23:28.713 --> 1:23:30.047
But if we don't build enough,

1:23:30.715 --> 1:23:34.343
when the monsoon arrives,
the boys will drown.

1:26:18.090 --> 1:26:21.760
I pray to the Guardian Spirit of the forest

1:26:23.637 --> 1:26:27.057
to apologize for the thirteen boys.

1:26:27.141 --> 1:26:29.476
If they have offended you,

1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:32.771
intentionally or unintentionally,

1:26:34.481 --> 1:26:36.108
I apologize

1:26:36.191 --> 1:26:39.904
to all spirits in the forest.

1:26:40.529 --> 1:26:42.323
And spirits everywhere.

1:26:43.991 --> 1:26:47.953
Everyone at the ceremony would like to pray

1:26:49.121 --> 1:26:51.206
for the thirteen young boys

1:26:51.957 --> 1:26:55.377
to come back home safely.

1:28:51.160 --> 1:28:52.661
This will sting a little.

1:29:30.157 --> 1:29:33.452
They're taking us out today.
But they can only take four.

1:29:33.535 --> 1:29:34.870
They're taking us out.

1:29:47.049 --> 1:29:48.258
From your mom.

1:29:50.010 --> 1:29:51.470
Blessed by Kruba.

1:30:30.425 --> 1:30:31.260
Chai.

1:30:31.844 --> 1:30:32.678
Arm.

1:30:33.220 --> 1:30:34.388
Aat.

1:30:34.471 --> 1:30:35.764
Poom.

1:30:35.848 --> 1:30:37.474
Chai, you go first.

1:31:02.374 --> 1:31:04.835
They have to find a mask to fit you.

1:31:06.461 --> 1:31:07.337
Today?

1:31:07.921 --> 1:31:08.922
Probably tomorrow.

1:31:14.136 --> 1:31:16.180
Decha, you go.

1:31:27.065 --> 1:31:28.442
Open your mouth, Decha.

1:32:08.523 --> 1:32:09.816
You'll be home soon.

1:32:12.069 --> 1:32:13.946
He's tying Decha's hands.

1:32:23.372 --> 1:32:24.498
It will be okay.

1:32:32.005 --> 1:32:34.800
Move back, turn around.

1:33:39.990 --> 1:33:41.450
Look away.

1:43:36.377 --> 1:43:38.504
Gently.

1:43:43.301 --> 1:43:44.427
How is he?

1:43:45.053 --> 1:43:46.346
He's still breathing.

1:43:51.309 --> 1:43:53.353
Careful with his head.

1:43:55.355 --> 1:43:57.315
Oxygen coming.

1:44:04.072 --> 1:44:05.490
Vital signs are stable.

1:45:21.065 --> 1:45:22.275
A boy is coming out!

1:45:31.034 --> 1:45:33.411
The governor asked me to tell everyone

1:45:33.494 --> 1:45:35.204
the rescue is going well so far.

1:45:35.371 --> 1:45:37.081
Why can't we have names?

1:45:38.875 --> 1:45:41.252
I'm afraid we can't release any details.

1:45:43.212 --> 1:45:45.673
I know how hard it must
be for all of you

1:45:45.757 --> 1:45:49.343
but when the operation is complete,
you'll be the first to know.

1:45:49.427 --> 1:45:52.138
Why does it have to be a secret?

1:46:53.908 --> 1:46:54.742
Careful.

1:50:58.527 --> 1:51:01.947
The air tanks are all strategically
placed along the route.

1:51:02.031 --> 1:51:07.078
During yesterday's rescue,
they used every single tank.

1:51:09.830 --> 1:51:13.751
The governor of Chiang Rai province
called this "A War With Water."

1:51:13.834 --> 1:51:17.088
Local forecasting is predicting heavy rain.

1:52:04.260 --> 1:52:05.553
Bring down more pipe!

1:52:07.596 --> 1:52:08.722
There's no more!

1:52:09.348 --> 1:52:10.724
Is that the last of the pipe?

1:52:10.808 --> 1:52:12.518
We sent for more from Bangkok.

1:52:13.853 --> 1:52:15.062
Need more pipe?

1:52:29.118 --> 1:52:29.952
Pipe.

1:53:03.110 --> 1:53:08.032
We're hearing that five boys have
been brought out of the cave today.

1:53:08.657 --> 1:53:13.746
Recent weather reports show
storm clouds on the horizon.

1:53:15.664 --> 1:53:19.627
The monsoon season is closing in fast.

1:56:26.689 --> 1:56:27.856
Hurry.

1:56:27.940 --> 1:56:30.567
It won't stop raining.
We need more sandbags.

1:56:30.651 --> 1:56:34.446
Everyone, there are three
sinkholes in the rocks to the east.

1:58:12.544 --> 1:58:13.754
I can't swim.

1:58:14.922 --> 1:58:16.173
Will we survive?

1:58:16.924 --> 1:58:19.676
Don't be afraid. We have to trust them.

1:58:38.278 --> 1:58:39.613
Are we the last to go?

2:00:27.804 --> 2:00:29.222
The boys?

2:00:29.306 --> 2:00:31.099
Are they out safely?

2:00:31.975 --> 2:00:33.977
We hope so. Your turn now.

2:02:40.854 --> 2:02:47.152
The clock is ticking,
putting pressure on the rescue team.

2:02:47.235 --> 2:02:52.157
The fear is the heavy downpour
will push water back into the cave

2:02:52.240 --> 2:02:57.913
faster than the volunteers can
divert the rain from the mountain.

2:04:40.682 --> 2:04:44.311
He's good. He's good.

2:07:01.406 --> 2:07:02.490
Coach looks good.

2:10:47.674 --> 2:10:49.384
Everyone out!

2:10:49.467 --> 2:10:50.885
The pumps are exploding!

2:16:11.205 --> 2:16:12.582
That's everyone, sir.

2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:15.084
All but one.

2:18:18.374 --> 2:18:20.292
-Say "cheese."
-Cheese!
