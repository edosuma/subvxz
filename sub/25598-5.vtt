WEBVTT

00:00.038 --> 00:01.354
<i>Previously, on "Suits..."</i>

00:01.355 --> 00:03.690
There's a whole life
going on here

00:03.725 --> 00:05.525
that you're not even a part of.

00:05.560 --> 00:07.226
You think I don't know
what I've missed?

00:07.262 --> 00:09.395
I'm not just talking about
birthdays, Harvey.

00:09.431 --> 00:10.363
I got sick again.
- What?

00:10.398 --> 00:11.831
Why didn't you tell me?

00:11.866 --> 00:13.299
- Did you know?
- Know what?

00:13.335 --> 00:14.300
That Gavin Andrews
was gonna ask me

00:14.336 --> 00:15.668
to launder money
for him?

00:15.704 --> 00:16.869
Help me get out of this.

00:16.905 --> 00:18.271
Please, Samantha.

00:18.306 --> 00:20.406
I should have listened to you,
but I have a family.

00:20.442 --> 00:22.742
I want to make a perfect baby
with you.

00:22.777 --> 00:24.611
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

00:24.646 --> 00:26.579
And I don't want to just be
pulling the goalie.

00:26.615 --> 00:29.382
I want to start trying, and I
want to start trying right now.

00:29.417 --> 00:31.684
I know you think we're in
competition for the same thing,

00:31.720 --> 00:32.819
but we're not.

00:32.854 --> 00:35.221
Robert Zane made me a promise:

00:35.256 --> 00:36.834
the next name that goes up on
the wall is mine.

00:36.858 --> 00:38.424
Why are you telling me this?

00:38.460 --> 00:39.604
Because we're never gonna
trust each other

00:39.628 --> 00:40.638
if you think I'm trying to get
ahead of you.

00:40.662 --> 00:43.084
I'm not, because I already am.

00:47.268 --> 00:48.201
Sheila.

00:48.236 --> 00:49.936
It's after 9:00.
You're gonna be late.

00:49.971 --> 00:51.415
Then I'll be late,
because there's something

00:51.439 --> 00:53.673
I need to ask you.
- Yeah, of course.

00:53.708 --> 00:55.119
- You can ask me anything.
- Louis, have you ever gotten

00:55.143 --> 00:57.143
a woman pregnant before?

00:57.178 --> 00:59.278
Okay, uh...

00:59.314 --> 01:01.347
Where is this going?

01:01.383 --> 01:04.751
I'm asking because
you haven't gotten this woman

01:04.786 --> 01:06.419
pregnant yet either.

01:06.454 --> 01:08.187
Sheila,
we just started trying,

01:08.223 --> 01:09.433
and I think
what I've been doing

01:09.457 --> 01:10.701
is more than meeting
the standards.

01:10.725 --> 01:12.859
Louis, you are
an A/A-plus lover.

01:12.894 --> 01:14.494
Everyone knows that.
- There's a slash?

01:14.529 --> 01:16.129
That's not the point.
The point is,

01:16.164 --> 01:17.930
have you ever considered
the possibility

01:17.966 --> 01:20.466
that you're shooting blanks?
- No more than I would consider

01:20.502 --> 01:21.812
the possibility
that I don't have a face.

01:21.836 --> 01:24.537
I get that, Louis,
and you probably have the sperm

01:24.572 --> 01:27.273
of a thoroughbred,
but I'd like you

01:27.308 --> 01:29.409
to get yourself checked.
- Sheila, if you're asking

01:29.444 --> 01:31.222
what I think you are,
I don't want to go to a place

01:31.246 --> 01:33.312
where people do...

01:33.348 --> 01:34.881
that...

01:34.916 --> 01:36.315
unless it's
absolutely necessary.

01:36.351 --> 01:38.651
I get that, too,
but the fact is,

01:38.687 --> 01:40.564
I'm not getting any younger
and we don't have time

01:40.588 --> 01:43.256
to waste, so I'm getting
myself checked,

01:43.291 --> 01:45.725
and I'm asking you
to do the same.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.428
So here's the address.

01:48.463 --> 01:51.030
You have an appointment today.

01:53.535 --> 01:55.768
Okay, Sheila,
I'll get it done.

01:55.804 --> 01:57.737
Thank you.

01:57.772 --> 01:59.772
Harvey, do you have a second?

01:59.808 --> 02:01.641
- Sure, Louis, what is it?
- Did you ever have

02:01.676 --> 02:03.409
to test your sperm?

02:03.445 --> 02:05.011
- What?
- Sheila wants me to,

02:05.046 --> 02:06.657
but I don't think I can do it
in one of those places.

02:06.681 --> 02:08.425
Louis, I don't want
to have this conversation.

02:08.449 --> 02:09.860
It's bad enough
that we share the same dentist.

02:09.883 --> 02:11.584
Harvey, come on.

02:11.619 --> 02:14.353
We're trying to have a baby,
and I don't have anyone else

02:14.389 --> 02:16.622
to talk to about this.

02:16.658 --> 02:18.591
Okay, what--
what's your problem?

02:18.626 --> 02:22.361
Problem is, I've never had
to do it under duress before.

02:22.397 --> 02:24.530
I don't know how.
- Well, why don't you do it

02:24.566 --> 02:25.932
like everyone else does?

02:25.967 --> 02:27.600
Use pictures.
- I don't use pictures.

02:27.635 --> 02:28.501
I only think of Sheila,
and I can't do that

02:28.536 --> 02:30.002
with a bunch
of strangers there.

02:30.038 --> 02:31.382
Well, what did you do
before Sheila?

02:31.406 --> 02:33.439
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Well, I don't want

02:33.475 --> 02:34.518
to talk about any of this.
- Harvey, come on.

02:34.542 --> 02:36.776
All right, look...

02:36.811 --> 02:38.644
you can't use pictures;
you don't want

02:38.680 --> 02:40.012
to think about Sheila.

02:40.048 --> 02:41.492
Well, then, you'll have
to think of something

02:41.516 --> 02:42.593
that turns you on
that isn't Sheila.

02:42.617 --> 02:46.319
You mean think about
an inanimate object.

02:46.354 --> 02:48.354
Yes, Louis,
that's what I mean.

02:48.389 --> 02:49.967
- Have you done that before?
- Of course I have.

02:49.991 --> 02:51.469
- What do you use?
- No, I'm not telling you that.

02:51.493 --> 02:53.726
Harvey, please.

02:53.762 --> 02:57.563
All right.
You want the truth?

02:57.599 --> 02:59.665
Sometimes...

02:59.701 --> 03:01.567
I think about...

03:01.603 --> 03:03.369
tomatoes.

03:04.339 --> 03:06.305
- Really?
- Well, if you think about it,

03:06.341 --> 03:08.474
they're the most sensual fruit.
- I thought they were

03:08.510 --> 03:10.076
a vegetable?
- I am opening my soul

03:10.111 --> 03:11.644
to you here;
don't criticize me.

03:11.679 --> 03:13.045
I'm sorry, you're right.

03:13.081 --> 03:16.015
Thank you, Harvey.

03:16.050 --> 03:18.818
Good luck in there, buddy.

03:18.853 --> 03:20.987
Yeah.
Tomatoes, holy shit.

03:21.022 --> 03:23.022
Never thought of that.

03:26.961 --> 03:28.995
You wanna tell me
what that was all about?

03:29.030 --> 03:30.997
No, because I'm guessing
you listened

03:31.032 --> 03:33.833
to the entire conversation,
which means you know

03:33.868 --> 03:35.768
what it's about.
- In that case,

03:35.804 --> 03:37.948
what I really want to know is:
is it true about the tomatoes?

03:37.972 --> 03:39.939
I think we both know
it's not.

03:39.974 --> 03:42.542
Just like we both know
it's really strawberries

03:42.577 --> 03:44.977
and whipped cream.

03:45.013 --> 03:47.413
What, too soon?
- No.

03:47.448 --> 03:49.382
But this is an office,
and someone could overhear

03:49.417 --> 03:51.751
and misunderstand that
that was 13 years ago.

03:51.786 --> 03:53.019
Really?
'Cause it feels like

03:53.054 --> 03:54.554
12 and 1/2 to me.

03:54.589 --> 03:57.056
- You're an idiot.
- No, Louis is an idiot.

03:57.091 --> 04:00.860
because he believed
I think about tomatoes.

04:00.895 --> 04:03.029
And if Sheila wants him
to get his swimmers checked,

04:03.064 --> 04:05.364
we shouldn't mock
that he has to do that...

04:05.400 --> 04:07.033
in a cup...

04:07.068 --> 04:09.602
thinking about tomatoes.
- You're absolutely right.

04:09.637 --> 04:11.137
We should take it
very seriously.

04:11.172 --> 04:13.639
Tomatoes.
- Okay, you know what?

04:13.675 --> 04:15.875
As much as I would love
to do this all day,

04:15.910 --> 04:19.579
I came in here to tell you
you need to call Marcus.

04:19.613 --> 04:20.913
Marcus?
About what?

04:20.949 --> 04:22.882
I don't know,
but he left me a message

04:22.917 --> 04:24.662
that he wants you to call him.
- Well, if he wants me to call,

04:24.686 --> 04:26.619
why would he be leaving
a message for you?

04:26.654 --> 04:29.555
Because when Marcus
really needs you, he calls me.

04:29.591 --> 04:31.490
He's only ever done that twice,

04:31.526 --> 04:34.727
which means whatever it is
he needs, it's important.

04:36.497 --> 04:39.031
All right, Donna,
I'll call him.

04:39.067 --> 04:41.467
Today, Harvey.

04:41.502 --> 04:42.802
Today.

04:50.945 --> 04:52.178
Hey, Harvey.

04:52.213 --> 04:53.946
I'm glad you called.

04:53.982 --> 04:55.092
I take it Donna
gave you my message?

04:55.116 --> 04:57.516
She did.
What's going on?

04:57.552 --> 04:59.685
<i>- I'm getting a divorce.</i>
- What?

04:59.721 --> 05:00.887
<i>I know.</i>

05:00.922 --> 05:03.522
And I know it is a big ask,

05:03.558 --> 05:05.625
but I was hoping
that you could represent me.

05:05.660 --> 05:07.760
Marcus, hold on.
When did this happen?

05:07.795 --> 05:09.540
The last time I was up there
everything seemed fine.

05:09.564 --> 05:11.797
Yeah, well, it's not fine,
and as much as I hate it,

05:11.833 --> 05:13.966
this is what she wants.
- If you want me to help you,

05:14.002 --> 05:15.768
I'm gonna need
to know more than that.

05:15.803 --> 05:16.535
<i>What do you want me</i>
<i>to tell you, Harvey?</i>

05:16.571 --> 05:18.504
<i>That we grew apart?</i>

05:18.539 --> 05:19.783
Well, we did.
<i>- Bullshit, I know you.</i>

05:19.807 --> 05:22.775
It's not the full story.
<i>- You're right, it's not,</i>

05:22.810 --> 05:24.655
and I will tell you everything
when you get up here.

05:24.679 --> 05:26.112
<i>I didn't say</i>
<i>I was coming up there,</i>

05:26.147 --> 05:27.625
and I'm not going to
unless you tell me

05:27.649 --> 05:28.915
what's going on, right now.

05:33.021 --> 05:35.121
I slept with someone,
all right?

05:35.156 --> 05:37.156
- You did what?
<i>- I was stupid,</i>

05:37.191 --> 05:39.125
and I had an affair,
and I know you want

05:39.160 --> 05:41.661
to rip my head off right now--
<i>- You're damn right, I do!</i>

05:41.696 --> 05:43.696
'Cause you know better
than anyone

05:43.731 --> 05:46.232
what that does to a family.
- Right now, I don't care.

05:46.267 --> 05:47.578
What the hell
did you just say to me?

05:47.602 --> 05:49.635
<i>Harvey, you're always</i>
<i>telling your clients</i>

05:49.671 --> 05:51.637
that your issues
are your issues

05:51.673 --> 05:53.550
and that you don't judge people
for what they do.

05:53.574 --> 05:55.975
<i>So right now I don't need</i>
<i>to hear how I screwed up.</i>

05:56.010 --> 05:57.988
What I need to hear is that
you're on your way up here

05:58.012 --> 06:00.146
to help make sure
that I don't lose my kids.

06:00.181 --> 06:01.714
What are you talking about?

06:01.749 --> 06:03.816
I'm talking about custody,
Harvey,

06:03.851 --> 06:06.085
<i>because Katie hired a shark</i>
<i>to represent her.</i>

06:06.120 --> 06:07.887
Which means even if
you didn't want this

06:07.922 --> 06:09.655
to turn into a fight...
<i>- I can't risk</i>

06:09.691 --> 06:11.657
not treating it like one,
and the best way I know

06:11.693 --> 06:13.537
to avoid a fight is to show up
with a howitzer--

06:13.561 --> 06:15.094
and, Harvey...

06:15.129 --> 06:18.698
the biggest howitzer I know
is you.

06:18.733 --> 06:20.166
All right, Marcus,
I'll come up.

All right, you have your tea.
Now let's get you set up

06:58.935 --> 07:00.307
in the library.
- You mean the room

07:00.308 --> 07:02.074
with the books
I can literally see from here?

07:02.110 --> 07:03.120
Joy, I don't need
to have any attitude.

07:03.144 --> 07:08.214
I can set myself up, Dad,
thanks.

07:09.249 --> 07:11.416
These associates get younger

07:11.451 --> 07:13.451
and angrier, don't they?
- That's not an associate;

07:13.487 --> 07:14.564
that's my daughter.
- And you think

07:14.588 --> 07:16.221
I didn't know that?

07:16.256 --> 07:18.123
I can spot
a ninth-grade pushback

07:18.158 --> 07:19.991
from a mile away.

07:20.027 --> 07:22.005
Let me ask you something:
how'd you manage your kids?

07:22.029 --> 07:24.529
- What do you mean, manage 'em?
- I mean, Joy got in trouble

07:24.564 --> 07:26.097
at school,
that's why she's here.

07:26.133 --> 07:27.665
And she may be a pain
in the ass,

07:27.701 --> 07:29.345
but she finishes her homework
in 18 seconds

07:29.369 --> 07:30.680
and all I have today
is paperwork.

07:30.704 --> 07:31.936
I got it.

07:31.972 --> 07:34.072
Your daughter won't listen
and you don't want

07:34.107 --> 07:36.141
to talk to her, anyway.
- No, I just don't know

07:36.176 --> 07:37.453
what to say to her
to get her to hear me.

07:37.477 --> 07:39.310
That's because sometimes
there is no way

07:39.346 --> 07:40.211
to get them to hear you.

07:40.247 --> 07:42.080
But they might
hear someone else.

07:42.115 --> 07:44.516
Someone--someone cool.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.418
- Someone like you?
- No, no, no.

07:46.453 --> 07:48.319
Not me.
- Come on, Gretchen,

07:48.355 --> 07:50.266
what's it gonna take?
- I'm not saying I won't do it.

07:50.290 --> 07:51.723
I'm saying it won't work.
- Why not?

07:51.758 --> 07:55.493
Because it can't be someone
you think is cool...

07:55.529 --> 07:57.195
It has to be someone
she thinks is cool.

07:57.230 --> 07:58.930
Well, look at that.

07:58.965 --> 08:00.532
Maybe you're not doomed
after all.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.000
Now, move out of the way.

08:02.035 --> 08:03.968
I gotta get me some
of that almond milk.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.074

08:18.752 --> 08:19.851
Hello.

08:19.886 --> 08:22.053
My name is Louis Litt,
I'm here to, uh...

08:25.559 --> 08:27.025
You know, make a deposit.

08:27.060 --> 08:29.060
Ah, of course.

08:29.096 --> 08:31.696
11:00, right on the dot.
- Well, punctuality helps me

08:31.731 --> 08:32.975
get in the right head space.
- Then why don't you

08:32.999 --> 08:34.376
take a look
at our preparatory materials--

08:34.400 --> 08:37.669
and before you ask,
I promise, whatever you need,

08:37.703 --> 08:39.370
we've got you covered.
- Oh, that's great.

08:39.405 --> 08:41.005
Then I'll just
take a quick look

08:41.041 --> 08:42.518
at "The Wall Street Journal."
- The what?

08:42.542 --> 08:44.253
"The Wall Street Journal."
America's paper of record.

08:44.277 --> 08:45.288
What do you need
"The Wall Street Journal" for?

08:45.312 --> 08:46.211
What do you mean,
what do I need it for?

08:46.246 --> 08:47.423
I need it
to conduct my business.

08:47.447 --> 08:49.380
But we don't
conduct business here.

08:49.416 --> 08:50.715
No, not that kind
of business.

08:50.750 --> 08:51.683
This kind of business.
- Are you telling me...

08:51.718 --> 08:52.584
Yes.
I need a "Wall Street Journal,"

08:52.619 --> 08:54.986
a "Forbes,"
"Investor's Weekly"--

08:55.021 --> 08:56.332
anything of a fiscal
and fiduciary nature.

08:56.356 --> 08:57.400
Well, we don't have
those things.

08:57.424 --> 08:58.568
Who are you?
You just said anything I need

08:58.592 --> 09:00.592
you got me covered.
What is your problem?

09:00.627 --> 09:03.661
Well, it's not
the clinic's, but...

09:03.697 --> 09:05.597
I have the real estate section
of the newspaper.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.232
Give me that shit.

09:07.267 --> 09:10.235
Standard, standard, standard,
blah, blah, blah...

09:10.270 --> 09:12.181
Holy shit, they want how much
for a two bedroom--

09:12.205 --> 09:13.505
Mm, Chubby Checker.
That'll work.

09:13.540 --> 09:14.739
- Really?
- Yes, really.

09:14.774 --> 09:15.785
I need a room.
I need one now.

09:15.809 --> 09:16.741
I'll even share it
with somebody.

09:16.776 --> 09:18.543
Come on, get the cup.
- All right...

09:18.578 --> 09:20.345
- Get the cup!
- This way.

09:22.816 --> 09:25.183
Samantha, you got a second?

09:25.218 --> 09:27.051
What I have
is less than four hours

09:27.087 --> 09:29.087
to find proof Insight Drugs
has ripped off

09:29.122 --> 09:30.433
our client's heart medication.
- That's too bad,

09:30.457 --> 09:31.389
because I need help
with something,

09:31.424 --> 09:33.525
and you're the perfect person.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.127
- You're asking for my help?
- Yes, I am.

09:36.163 --> 09:38.363
- What's the case?
- Williams versus Williams,

09:38.398 --> 09:40.365
and I'm losing big time.
- What, now?

09:40.400 --> 09:42.233
My daughter.
She's here for two days

09:42.269 --> 09:44.636
because she got suspended,
and worse, when I asked her

09:44.671 --> 09:46.404
what happened,
she lied to me about it.

09:46.439 --> 09:47.517
So you're coming to me
because you don't think

09:47.541 --> 09:49.541
she'll listen to you
or your wife right now.

09:49.576 --> 09:51.476
She's a smart kid,
but right now

09:51.511 --> 09:52.410
all she cares about
is being cool,

09:52.445 --> 09:53.856
so I need someone like you
to show her

09:53.880 --> 09:57.382
that being smart is cool.
- So you're saying I'm cool.

09:57.417 --> 09:58.716
To a 15-year-old
who won't listen

09:58.752 --> 10:01.085
to a word her father says, yes.

10:01.121 --> 10:02.820
Well, maybe that's because
she doesn't need

10:02.856 --> 10:05.256
to listen right now,
she needs to be heard.

10:05.292 --> 10:06.736
Because I can tell you
from experience,

10:06.760 --> 10:09.260
being a teenage girl
is pretty damn hard.

10:09.296 --> 10:11.095
Does that mean you'll do it?

10:11.131 --> 10:13.298
I guess it does.

10:14.267 --> 10:15.800
Just don't make me
regret this.

10:15.835 --> 10:17.769
Alex, if you don't know
by now,

10:17.804 --> 10:20.071
making people regret things
is kind of what I do.

10:20.106 --> 10:23.408
Then you and Joy
are gonna get along just fine.

10:23.443 --> 10:25.710
Thanks, Samantha.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.517
- What is this?
- Sanitizer.

10:32.552 --> 10:34.586
I heard you had
a particularly dirty case

10:34.621 --> 10:36.087
on your hands.

10:36.122 --> 10:37.055
- Harvey told you.
- You mean that this

10:37.090 --> 10:39.324
was the hardest case
you ever had?

10:39.359 --> 10:41.426
That the client was really
jerking you around?

10:41.461 --> 10:42.327
- That...
- Are you finished?

10:42.362 --> 10:43.695
- Are you finished?
- Donna!

10:43.730 --> 10:45.763
I'm just asking as a friend.

10:45.799 --> 10:48.199
Did you slay the dragon?
Did you bop the potato?

10:48.235 --> 10:50.268
Did you wallop the badinger?

10:50.303 --> 10:53.271
"Wallop the badinger"?
- Yeah, I was on a roll.

10:53.306 --> 10:55.440
Whatever--no...

10:55.875 --> 10:57.508
Louis, what's wrong?

10:57.544 --> 10:59.544
I was just joking around.

10:59.579 --> 11:02.680
Did it not go okay?

11:02.716 --> 11:06.317
- It's not that, Donna.
- Then what is it?

11:06.353 --> 11:08.720
- What if I can't have kids?
- Louis...

11:08.755 --> 11:10.388
It is all I've ever wanted,

11:10.423 --> 11:12.657
but it has never once
occurred to me

11:12.692 --> 11:14.292
that I might not be able
to do it.

11:14.327 --> 11:15.504
Well, has it occurred to you
that the reason

11:15.528 --> 11:17.795
you were never worried
is that there's no reason

11:17.831 --> 11:19.864
to be worried?
- Except Sheila is worried,

11:19.899 --> 11:21.199
and now it's in my head.

11:21.234 --> 11:24.135
Donna, what if it is me?
- Louis, right now

11:24.170 --> 11:26.537
we don't even know
if there's a problem at all,

11:26.573 --> 11:28.239
so I suggest
you cross that bridge

11:28.275 --> 11:29.173
when you come to it.

11:29.209 --> 11:30.353
And if you do,
and you need someone

11:30.377 --> 11:33.811
to talk about it with,
I'll be here.

11:33.847 --> 11:36.547
Thank you, Donna.

11:44.958 --> 11:46.324
Hey.

11:46.359 --> 11:47.892
Did you get a hold of Marcus?

11:47.927 --> 11:50.261
- I did.
- Then what's going on?

11:50.297 --> 11:52.930
He's not sick again, is he?
- No, nothing like that,

11:52.966 --> 11:55.266
but it's still not good.
- Then what is it?

11:55.302 --> 11:56.834
He cheated on Katie.

11:56.870 --> 11:58.836
She found out
and now she wants a divorce.

11:58.872 --> 12:00.238
Oh, my God.

12:00.273 --> 12:01.706
Are you kidding me?
- No.

12:01.741 --> 12:03.419
And that's not all;
he wants me to come up there

12:03.443 --> 12:05.443
and represent him.
- So what are you gonna do?

12:05.478 --> 12:07.211
What do you think
I'm gonna do?

12:07.247 --> 12:08.391
I'm gonna help him.
- Okay, look, I have to ask--

12:08.415 --> 12:09.759
are you sure
that you want to do this?

12:09.783 --> 12:13.184
I appreciate your concern,
Donna, but it's my brother.

12:13.219 --> 12:14.859
What am I supposed to do?
- All I'm saying

12:14.888 --> 12:16.532
is that this could bring up
a lot of shit for you.

12:16.556 --> 12:18.856
And I don't disagree,
but like I said,

12:18.892 --> 12:21.225
it's my brother.

12:21.261 --> 12:24.228
What am I supposed to do?
- Okay.

12:24.264 --> 12:26.531
But before you go,
after what just happened

12:26.566 --> 12:28.866
I think you should tell Robert.
- I already did.

12:28.902 --> 12:30.535
How did he take it?

12:30.570 --> 12:32.537
I have to give him credit,
he--

12:32.572 --> 12:33.871
he didn't hesitate
for a second.

12:33.907 --> 12:35.807
He said,
"Family comes first.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.343
Always does, always will."

12:45.914 --> 12:47.415
You must be Joy.

12:47.450 --> 12:49.417
That's the name they gave me.

12:50.031 --> 12:51.264
I'm Samantha.

12:51.299 --> 12:52.265
Your dad's gonna be stuck
in meetings all day,

12:52.300 --> 12:56.002
so he asked me
to check in on you.

12:56.037 --> 12:57.603
Samantha, is it?

12:57.639 --> 12:59.572
He didn't ask you
to check in on me.

12:59.607 --> 13:01.507
He asked you
to keep an eye on me

13:01.543 --> 13:02.942
because you're the cool one.

13:02.977 --> 13:04.644
Well, you might be cool to him,

13:04.679 --> 13:06.813
but you're not cool to me.

13:07.749 --> 13:09.782
Okay.

13:09.818 --> 13:13.052
I see what this is.

13:13.088 --> 13:15.621
I'll tell you mine
if you tell me yours.

13:15.657 --> 13:18.024
- Your what?
- My "why I got suspended."

13:18.059 --> 13:20.960
- You got suspended?
- Just once.

13:20.995 --> 13:23.996
But from three
different schools.

13:27.335 --> 13:28.868
That's the football field.

13:28.903 --> 13:30.737
I used industrial bleach.

13:30.772 --> 13:32.605
That shit's not coming out
for months.

13:32.640 --> 13:36.943
Wow, that is
some colorful language.

13:36.978 --> 13:38.811
So what'd you do?

13:38.847 --> 13:40.613
The worst one?

13:40.648 --> 13:42.448
I boosted a car
from the school parking lot.

13:42.484 --> 13:44.517
- You stole somebody's car.
- Not somebody's,

13:44.552 --> 13:45.785
the principal's.

13:45.820 --> 13:47.954
Turns out that is not
a good idea.

13:47.989 --> 13:49.055
Got it.

13:49.090 --> 13:51.324
Don't steal
the principal's car.

13:51.359 --> 13:53.426
I'm not saying
breaking the rules

13:53.461 --> 13:54.560
is a bad thing.

13:54.596 --> 13:57.797
I'm saying you just need
to know which ones to break.

13:58.967 --> 14:01.401
I don't think you're supposed
to tell me that.

14:01.436 --> 14:03.336
Maybe not,
but if you're gonna help me

14:03.371 --> 14:05.905
the next couple of days,
you should know how I work.

14:05.940 --> 14:07.473
- Help you?
- Yeah.

14:07.509 --> 14:08.586
I've got a deposition
this afternoon

14:08.610 --> 14:10.810
and nothing to force
the other guy's hand.

14:10.845 --> 14:11.978
You in?

14:12.013 --> 14:13.646
- I'm in.
- Well, then, Joy,

14:13.681 --> 14:16.048
you and I
are gonna need some coffee.

14:24.859 --> 14:27.427
Harvey,
what are you doing here?

14:27.462 --> 14:30.997
I'm here because Marcus
asked me to represent him.

14:31.032 --> 14:32.832
Then you shouldn't
be contacting me

14:32.867 --> 14:35.034
without my lawyer.
- No, I shouldn't.

14:35.069 --> 14:36.969
But I'm not here as a lawyer.

14:37.005 --> 14:38.671
I'm here
as your brother-in-law.

14:38.706 --> 14:40.518
- What does that mean?
- It means I know Marcus

14:40.542 --> 14:43.376
still loves you, and...

14:43.411 --> 14:45.144
I need to know
if there isn't still a way

14:45.180 --> 14:46.779
that you guys
can work this out.

14:46.815 --> 14:48.359
And as much as I wish
that could happen,

14:48.383 --> 14:49.682
it's too late for that.

14:49.717 --> 14:51.617
Look, Marcus told me
what happened...

14:51.653 --> 14:52.618
And you're still
standing here

14:52.654 --> 14:54.987
trying to defend him.
- No, I'm not.

14:55.023 --> 14:58.624
When he told me, believe me,
I wanted to lay him out myself,

14:58.660 --> 15:00.960
but I also know
what it feels like

15:00.995 --> 15:02.740
to have your family
ripped apart, and I don't want

15:02.764 --> 15:04.697
to see that happen.
- You think I do?

15:04.732 --> 15:06.966
No, I don't,
but I'm telling you,

15:07.001 --> 15:09.869
the second
lawyers get involved...

15:09.904 --> 15:11.070
it's gonna get messy.

15:11.105 --> 15:12.905
It's already messy, Harvey.

15:12.941 --> 15:14.674
And my lawyer's
already involved,

15:14.709 --> 15:17.543
so be Marcus' lawyer or don't,

15:17.579 --> 15:20.613
but either way
I can't talk to you anymore.

15:27.922 --> 15:29.989
No, no, you sit here.

15:30.024 --> 15:32.525
- Why?
- Those two over there

15:32.560 --> 15:34.393
are opposing council
and his client.

15:34.429 --> 15:35.394
What does that have to do
with where I sit?

15:35.430 --> 15:37.497
It has to do
with where I sit.

15:37.532 --> 15:40.066
- I don't understand.
- Let me explain.

15:40.101 --> 15:43.202
I have nothing on this asshole,
but I know he's lying.

15:43.238 --> 15:45.605
So I'm going to bluff him
in an hour,

15:45.640 --> 15:47.073
and this is where
that bluff starts.

15:47.108 --> 15:48.574
So you're just gonna
stare at him?

15:48.610 --> 15:51.010
No, I'm also going to laugh

15:51.045 --> 15:52.778
and drink my coffee
and show him

15:52.814 --> 15:54.847
how incredibly confident I am.

15:54.883 --> 15:55.915
I get it.

15:55.950 --> 15:57.783
You're trying
to get in their heads.

15:57.819 --> 16:00.720
- Not trying, doing.
- Awesome.

16:00.755 --> 16:02.622
I'll get us some drinks.
- You're buying?

16:02.657 --> 16:04.590
- My dad's buying.
- In that case,

16:04.626 --> 16:07.793
I will take a dozen bagels,
seven donuts, and...

16:07.829 --> 16:10.730
one of those fancy
espresso machines over there.

16:16.771 --> 16:18.204
Don't tell me--
the results are in.

16:18.239 --> 16:19.939
- They are.
- And?

16:19.974 --> 16:21.485
They want me to meet
with the doctor in person.

16:21.509 --> 16:22.942
- And?
- And I want you

16:22.977 --> 16:25.545
to come with me.
- Louis, I--

16:25.580 --> 16:27.246
I don't mean
to sound insensitive,

16:27.282 --> 16:29.615
but I really think
that you should do this

16:29.651 --> 16:31.484
on your own.
- Donna...

16:31.519 --> 16:32.618
they said "in person."

16:32.654 --> 16:34.265
That can't be good.
- But don't they do that

16:34.289 --> 16:35.821
for everyone?
- Maybe they do,

16:35.857 --> 16:37.223
but I just don't want
to be alone.

16:37.258 --> 16:39.125
And I understand that,
but I'm not the woman

16:39.160 --> 16:40.960
you should be asking.

16:40.995 --> 16:43.496
- Sheila.
- She's your partner in this.

16:43.531 --> 16:45.598
I know that, but what if...

16:45.633 --> 16:47.767
- What if what?
- Donna, if I'm the reason

16:47.802 --> 16:50.102
we can't have kids,
I wanna be the one to tell her.

16:50.138 --> 16:52.004
Not some guy in a lab coat.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.741
And if you really want me
to go with you, I will, but...

16:55.777 --> 16:56.887
if I were Sheila,
I wouldn't want

16:56.911 --> 17:00.646
to be the second woman
in your life to find that out.

17:00.682 --> 17:02.815
You're right, Donna.

17:08.156 --> 17:09.922
Don't tell me
they ran out of coffee.

17:09.958 --> 17:12.791
No, I got something better
than coffee.

17:17.198 --> 17:19.498
I didn't know what to do,
so I just hit "record."

17:19.534 --> 17:22.602
Does it help?
- It sure as shit doesn't hurt.

17:22.637 --> 17:23.714
Huh.
- Does that mean you don't have

17:23.738 --> 17:25.605
to sit here and smile at them?

17:25.640 --> 17:27.540
No, it just means
it's gonna be

17:27.575 --> 17:29.775
a hell of a lot more fun.

17:36.050 --> 17:37.783
Harvey.

17:37.819 --> 17:39.552
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago.

17:39.587 --> 17:40.864
There was something
I had to do first.

17:40.888 --> 17:42.521
Yeah, I know
what you had to do,

17:42.557 --> 17:44.034
and I wish you hadn't done it.
- Listen to me...

17:44.058 --> 17:45.703
Harvey, you said
you were gonna come up here

17:45.727 --> 17:47.137
and help me, not stir things up
with Katie.

17:47.161 --> 17:48.995
Marcus, you said
you wanted peace, so I tried

17:49.030 --> 17:51.263
to make peace.
- Yeah, well, what you did

17:51.299 --> 17:53.966
was make it worse.

17:56.237 --> 17:57.837
- Shit.
- What does that mean,

17:57.872 --> 18:00.072
"You've been sanctioned"?

18:00.108 --> 18:02.041
Look, it's a fine

18:02.076 --> 18:04.043
for contacting her
without her lawyer.

18:04.078 --> 18:05.878
It's nothing.
- No, I know you,

18:05.913 --> 18:07.546
and there's something else.

18:09.884 --> 18:13.085
If I file some kind of motion
and it's a coin toss,

18:13.121 --> 18:15.855
the judge probably rules
in their favor.

18:15.890 --> 18:19.025
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Marcus, I am sorry.

18:19.060 --> 18:20.526
You asked me to come up here,

18:20.561 --> 18:23.362
and like it or not...

18:24.532 --> 18:27.900
This is tough for me too,
so I tried with Katie.

18:27.935 --> 18:29.602
Okay, Harvey, I get it.

18:29.637 --> 18:30.914
I just wish
there was a chance in hell

18:30.938 --> 18:32.938
that it would've worked.

18:32.974 --> 18:34.607
So what are we gonna do now?

18:34.642 --> 18:35.886
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

18:35.910 --> 18:37.777
You want a peaceful settlement,

18:37.812 --> 18:39.845
we're gonna get you
a peaceful settlement.

18:43.554 --> 18:45.133
- Mr. Litt.
- Yes.

18:45.134 --> 18:46.867
- Please, have a seat.
- Oh, my God,

18:46.903 --> 18:48.550
it's worse than I thought.
I have no sperm at all.

18:48.551 --> 18:50.017
Of course not.

18:50.053 --> 18:52.386
In fact, I'm happy
to inform you

18:52.422 --> 18:55.456
that your sperm count
is perfectly fine.

18:55.491 --> 18:57.124
I see no reason
why you can't make

18:57.160 --> 18:59.727
any healthy woman pregnant.
- Great, fantastic.

18:59.762 --> 19:00.839
There is one thing, however.

19:00.863 --> 19:02.063
- One thing.
- I noticed

19:02.098 --> 19:03.208
on the lifestyle section
of our form,

19:03.232 --> 19:05.733
you put down "mudding."
- Yeah.

19:05.768 --> 19:08.469
Yes, it relaxes and soothes me.

19:08.504 --> 19:09.948
Come to think of it, doc,
I think that's the reason

19:09.972 --> 19:12.940
why my count is so robust.
- You'll have to give it up.

19:12.975 --> 19:14.675
- What now?
- Well, your count is fine,

19:14.711 --> 19:16.622
but due to your partner's age--
if you give up mudding,

19:16.646 --> 19:19.480
your chances of conceiving
go up significantly.

19:19.515 --> 19:21.749
- Define significantly.
- 80%.

19:21.784 --> 19:23.918
Holy shit, 80%?

19:23.953 --> 19:25.920
There's gotta be another way!
- There isn't.

19:25.955 --> 19:27.099
What if I put everything in
but my balls?

19:27.123 --> 19:28.756
- I don't...
- Scratch that,

19:28.791 --> 19:29.757
defeats the purpose.
- Mr. Litt...

19:29.792 --> 19:31.792
What if I cut down
on my sessions?

19:31.828 --> 19:32.793
I cut it down in half,
it improves our chances 40%.

19:32.829 --> 19:35.162
I'm afraid
it doesn't work that way.

19:35.198 --> 19:36.341
Well, then what are you
telling me?

19:36.365 --> 19:37.409
I'm telling you
that if you want to have

19:37.433 --> 19:39.767
the best chance
at having a child,

19:39.802 --> 19:41.969
you'll give up mudding
for the foreseeable future.

19:44.574 --> 19:45.973
Excuse me.

19:46.008 --> 19:47.286
Who is she,
and what's she doing here?

19:47.310 --> 19:48.587
It's "go to work
with your parent" day.

19:48.611 --> 19:49.376
She's your daughter?

19:49.412 --> 19:51.045
Something like that.

19:51.080 --> 19:52.858
But of course, if you're too
afraid to have her here,

19:52.882 --> 19:54.526
she doesn't have to be here.
- Fine with me if she stays,

19:54.550 --> 19:55.950
since this is gonna be

19:55.985 --> 19:57.129
the world's
shortest deposition

19:57.153 --> 19:58.430
Because you're ready
to admit you infringed

19:58.454 --> 20:01.622
on my client's patent to create
your generic knock-off?

20:01.657 --> 20:03.924
Because, my company
developed that drug

20:03.960 --> 20:06.360
from scratch, and your client
has no proof we didn't.

20:06.395 --> 20:08.140
Actually, we do have proof,
we're just not gonna use it.

20:08.164 --> 20:09.830
You're not gonna use it

20:09.866 --> 20:11.866
because it doesn't exist.
- I'm not gonna use it

20:11.901 --> 20:13.501
because I'd like you
to lie to my face

20:13.536 --> 20:14.969
in this deposition.

20:15.004 --> 20:17.638
And why is that?
- So when I reveal what we know

20:17.673 --> 20:19.807
in open court,
you not only lose this case,

20:19.842 --> 20:21.742
you get charged with perjury.

20:21.778 --> 20:23.178
Can't you get sent
to jail for that?

20:23.212 --> 20:25.079
Why, yes, Joy, you can.

20:25.114 --> 20:26.647
But you'd probably
go bankrupt, first,

20:26.682 --> 20:29.650
- trying to fight it.
- Hmm.

20:29.685 --> 20:31.218
You're bluffing.

20:31.254 --> 20:32.486
You don't have shit on him.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.755
I guess there's only one way
to find out.

20:34.791 --> 20:36.891
So, Mr. Coleman, did you
or did you not

20:36.926 --> 20:39.727
rip off our patent to create
your bullshit new drug?

20:39.762 --> 20:41.662
And before you answer,

20:41.697 --> 20:44.732
I'd like you to think back
to that decaf latte

20:44.767 --> 20:46.767
you were drinking
before coming up here.

20:46.803 --> 20:49.770
And, more specifically,
to the person waiting in line

20:49.806 --> 20:51.572
by your table...

20:51.607 --> 20:55.209
while you were trying so hard
not to look at me.

20:55.244 --> 20:57.111
That's what she's doing here.

20:57.146 --> 20:59.280
You set us up.
- You set yourself up

20:59.315 --> 21:00.848
because you went
to a public place

21:00.883 --> 21:02.516
and discussed a case
loud enough

21:02.552 --> 21:04.218
for a 15-year-old girl
who just happened

21:04.253 --> 21:07.621
to be recording the coffee shop
to pick you up on tape.

21:07.657 --> 21:10.257
Now, for the last time...

21:11.260 --> 21:13.227
Where'd your new drug
come from?

21:19.305 --> 21:22.006
All right.

21:22.042 --> 21:23.541
How much do you want?

21:27.714 --> 21:30.048
Gentlemen,
sorry to keep you waiting.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.749
My client and I
were just discussing

21:31.785 --> 21:34.218
a few last matters.
- Not a problem.

21:34.254 --> 21:36.220
Now that you're ready,
I suggest we start

21:36.256 --> 21:38.234
with division of property.
- Actually, we'd like to start

21:38.258 --> 21:40.058
with the most
important issue...

21:40.093 --> 21:41.459
- Our kids.
- Exactly.

21:41.494 --> 21:43.127
Because we're seeking
sole custody.

21:43.163 --> 21:45.329
What?
We--we didn't talk about that.

21:45.365 --> 21:47.231
And what was
or wasn't previously discussed

21:47.267 --> 21:48.482
is irrelevant.
- That's bull--

21:48.483 --> 21:49.883
Marcus, let me handle this.

21:49.918 --> 21:52.915
Because they don't really want
sole custody, they just want

21:52.916 --> 21:54.914
to start on one end
because they're expecting us

21:54.915 --> 21:55.951
to start on the other.

21:55.952 --> 21:58.533
But we don't want a fight,
so why don't we just all start

21:58.534 --> 22:00.051
in the middle?
- I'll tell you why--

22:00.052 --> 22:02.193
because we're not moving
on this at all.

22:02.313 --> 22:04.799
- Excuse me?
- Katie, don't do this.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.500
You did this
to yourself, Marcus.

22:06.535 --> 22:08.068
No, he didn't.
He may have screwed up,

22:08.103 --> 22:11.171
but you don't have the grounds
to take the kids.

22:11.207 --> 22:13.273
- Actually, we do.
- Bullshit.

22:13.309 --> 22:14.553
And I'm not gonna let you
play games like you did

22:14.577 --> 22:16.877
with those sanctions.
- What sanctions?

22:16.912 --> 22:18.278
You know what sanctions.

22:18.314 --> 22:19.691
The ones you had your lawyer
slap me with

22:19.715 --> 22:22.382
for coming to talk to you.
- I didn't authorize

22:22.418 --> 22:23.962
anything like that.
- You didn't need to.

22:23.986 --> 22:26.386
After you told me
he approached you improperly...

22:26.422 --> 22:27.899
You thought it was
a good idea to use that

22:27.923 --> 22:29.690
to bias the judge.
- I thought it would be

22:29.725 --> 22:31.692
a good idea to protect
my client's interests.

22:31.727 --> 22:34.528
Well, those kids aren't just
your client's interests.

22:34.563 --> 22:36.497
They're my brother's children--

22:36.532 --> 22:38.143
Well, then maybe
he should have cared enough

22:38.167 --> 22:39.800
to put their needs
ahead of his own.

22:39.835 --> 22:41.635
Katie, he may not have been
a perfect husband,

22:41.670 --> 22:44.404
but I am not gonna let you say
he's not a good father.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.306
How would you know
what kind of a father he is?

22:46.342 --> 22:48.475
I'll tell you how.
Every time I have seen them

22:48.511 --> 22:51.378
with him, every time
he has told me about them...

22:51.413 --> 22:53.213
And what about
what he told you

22:53.249 --> 22:54.860
about why we're splitting up?
- Just because he slept

22:54.884 --> 22:55.927
with someone else doesn't mean
he's not a good father.

22:55.951 --> 22:58.585
Slept with someone else?

22:58.621 --> 22:59.653
Oh, my God.

22:59.688 --> 23:01.889
He didn't tell you
what happened, did he?

23:01.924 --> 23:03.557
Katie...

23:03.592 --> 23:04.636
Marcus,
what's she talking about?

23:04.660 --> 23:06.727
You know what?
You can have that conversation

23:06.762 --> 23:08.629
on your own time,
'cause I'm not gonna

23:08.664 --> 23:10.397
let you tell me
this is all my fault

23:10.432 --> 23:12.299
when you don't even know
the whole story.

23:12.334 --> 23:14.668
Let me be clear:
I'm taking the kids

23:14.703 --> 23:16.737
because that is what is best
for them.

23:16.772 --> 23:18.572
And if you have a problem
with that, Harvey,

23:18.607 --> 23:20.741
you can take it up with
the man sitting next to you,

23:20.776 --> 23:22.976
'cause I'm done
defending myself.

23:25.047 --> 23:27.614
Katie!

23:29.952 --> 23:32.452
Okay, you tell me
and you tell me now.

23:32.488 --> 23:34.788
What was that all about?

23:34.823 --> 23:36.924
- I was gambling again.
- I don't believe this...

23:36.959 --> 23:38.759
It was just for a few weeks.

23:38.794 --> 23:40.305
It was almost a year ago,
and I've been in a program

23:40.329 --> 23:41.428
ever since.
- Let me guess:

23:41.463 --> 23:43.864
you didn't tell Katie,
just like you didn't tell me.

23:43.899 --> 23:44.665
- I was going to tell you.
- When?

23:44.700 --> 23:46.033
After the judge took your kids?

23:46.068 --> 23:47.834
Because they're right, Marcus.

23:47.870 --> 23:49.503
They do have the grounds
to do that,

23:49.538 --> 23:50.971
and you gave it to them.
- Harvey,

23:51.006 --> 23:52.450
there's gotta be something
you can do here.

23:52.474 --> 23:53.618
Not when I don't have
all the facts!

23:53.642 --> 23:56.443
I point-blank asked you
what happened, and you said

23:56.478 --> 23:57.444
it was because of an affair.

23:57.479 --> 23:58.779
Look, I know

23:58.814 --> 24:00.747
I should have told you,
but I'm telling you now.

24:00.783 --> 24:02.950
Well, then you tell me,
right now, anything else

24:02.985 --> 24:05.852
I should know,
and I mean anything.

24:07.022 --> 24:09.389
Haley caught me
making a bet.

24:09.425 --> 24:11.558
and I told her that I was just
playing a game,

24:11.594 --> 24:13.327
and that it could be
our little secret.

24:13.362 --> 24:14.573
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey, hey--where you going?

24:14.597 --> 24:17.331
- Back to New York.
- No, please, you can't--

24:17.366 --> 24:18.498
These are my kids!

24:18.534 --> 24:21.602
Your kids that you asked
to lie for you.

24:21.637 --> 24:22.681
which makes you no different
than Mom was.

24:22.705 --> 24:23.937
No, that is not fair.

24:23.973 --> 24:26.006
What Mom did
is nothing like this.

24:26.041 --> 24:28.775
You asked your kids
to keep your secrets.

24:28.811 --> 24:31.345
How is that different?
- Because it was one time

24:31.380 --> 24:32.991
and Haley had no idea
what I was doing was wrong.

24:33.015 --> 24:34.748
You know what?
Tell yourself

24:34.783 --> 24:36.528
whatever you want
about what kind of man you are.

24:36.552 --> 24:37.662
You're not just
a shitty husband;

24:37.686 --> 24:40.020
you're a shitty brother,
and I'm done here.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.086
What's this for?

24:48.121 --> 24:49.254
Well, I know it was

24:49.289 --> 24:51.589
a stressful day, and I thought
you deserved something

24:51.590 --> 24:53.525
with a little umbrella.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.627
You have no idea.
- Mm.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.329
So how did it go?

24:58.365 --> 25:00.331
- It was great.
- Really?

25:00.367 --> 25:02.433
What did he say?
- Mm.

25:02.469 --> 25:04.280
He said I should have no issue
getting you pregnant,

25:04.304 --> 25:05.470
and nothing else.

25:05.505 --> 25:06.549
Nothing else?

25:06.573 --> 25:08.339
Absolutely not one thing else.

25:08.375 --> 25:10.997
That's funny,
because I was told

25:10.998 --> 25:12.598
you have to give up mudding.
- What?

25:12.633 --> 25:13.810
How'd you know that?
- They called me

25:13.834 --> 25:15.969
right after they saw you.
- I don't believe this.

25:15.970 --> 25:19.173
This is a total violation
of the doctor-patient...

25:19.174 --> 25:21.408
Cut the bullshit, Louis.
You signed the form.

25:21.443 --> 25:23.910
The question is,
can you do this?

25:23.946 --> 25:25.779
- Of course I can do it.
- Are you sure?

25:25.814 --> 25:27.481
Because you couldn't even
admit it to me.

25:27.516 --> 25:28.560
I didn't wanna talk about it
because it was

25:28.584 --> 25:30.517
a difficult thing,
but I can handle it.

25:30.552 --> 25:32.163
You know nothing means more
to me than having a family.

25:32.187 --> 25:34.021
I do know that, Louis,
but I also know

25:34.056 --> 25:35.989
how your brain works,
and you're gonna try

25:36.025 --> 25:37.535
to figure out a way
to convince yourself

25:37.559 --> 25:40.193
that you can have both.

25:40.229 --> 25:42.996
I am a grown man,
and I am telling you,

25:43.032 --> 25:44.872
if a doctor tells me
I have to give up mudding,

25:44.900 --> 25:47.934
then I will give it up.
- Promise me.

25:47.970 --> 25:50.671
I promise.

26:00.149 --> 26:02.516
Mom, if you're here

26:02.551 --> 26:03.561
to talk about Marcus...
- Of course I'm here

26:03.585 --> 26:05.452
to talk about Marcus.

26:05.487 --> 26:09.056
Question is, are you going
to let me in or not?

26:09.091 --> 26:10.857
Then go ahead
and say your piece,

26:10.893 --> 26:12.793
but it's not
gonna change my mind.

26:12.828 --> 26:16.697
Well, I don't know
if it will or it won't...

26:16.732 --> 26:18.965
but I came to tell you
you're right.

26:19.001 --> 26:21.034
What Marcus did was horrible,

26:21.070 --> 26:23.637
and I understand
you being furious,

26:23.672 --> 26:25.639
but Haley's in fifth grade.

26:25.674 --> 26:27.307
She barely knows
what gambling is.

26:27.342 --> 26:28.642
She knows what lying is.

26:28.677 --> 26:30.977
She knows that her father
asked her to do it.

26:31.013 --> 26:32.713
And Marcus feels terrible
about that.

26:32.748 --> 26:33.958
Yeah, that's what
all addicts say.

26:33.982 --> 26:37.050
And your brother has never
been as strong as you are,

26:37.086 --> 26:38.997
but that doesn't mean...
- This isn't about strength.

26:39.021 --> 26:41.555
No, it's about forgiveness.

26:41.590 --> 26:44.157
And Marcus forgave me,
even when I failed you both,

26:44.193 --> 26:46.359
and then he forgave you
when you walked away.

26:46.395 --> 26:47.527
Are you saying I owe him?

26:47.563 --> 26:50.797
I'm saying
people make mistakes.

26:51.967 --> 26:54.735
Harvey, I know
how angry you are...

26:54.770 --> 26:57.838
but you can't let him lose
his children.

26:57.873 --> 27:00.741
Because I can tell you
from personal experience

27:00.776 --> 27:04.945
there is nothing worse
for the parent or the child.

27:04.980 --> 27:06.713
What am I supposed
to say to that?

27:06.749 --> 27:09.816
How about if I say
what we both know is true?

27:10.753 --> 27:12.119
This is all my fault.

27:12.154 --> 27:14.087
I modeled
all of this behavior

27:14.123 --> 27:17.257
for both of you,
but please, Harvey,

27:17.292 --> 27:21.128
don't make him pay
for my mistakes.

27:21.163 --> 27:23.730
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

27:24.733 --> 27:27.534
But I'm gonna need
to ask you some questions.

27:27.569 --> 27:29.936
So make yourself comfortable,

27:29.972 --> 27:33.039
because we're gonna be here
for a while.

27:42.084 --> 27:43.950
Thought you were done
with me.

27:43.986 --> 27:46.052
I'm your brother.

27:46.088 --> 27:49.122
I'm never gonna be done
with you.

27:49.158 --> 27:52.125
- You talked to Mom.
- I did.

27:52.161 --> 27:54.594
She basically said
it was all her fault.

27:54.630 --> 27:57.197
- Well, it wasn't.
- I know.

27:57.232 --> 27:59.065
But if I can forgive her,
I should be able

27:59.101 --> 28:01.234
to forgive you too.

28:01.270 --> 28:04.271
I figured out a way
to get you shared custody.

28:04.306 --> 28:06.373
But I am putting
in the agreement,

28:06.408 --> 28:08.408
you ever gamble again,
she gets the kids.

28:08.443 --> 28:11.244
You don't live up to that,
I don't care what the law says,

28:11.280 --> 28:14.047
I'll represent her to make sure
that's what happens.

28:14.082 --> 28:16.850
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:23.125 --> 28:25.659
Um...

28:25.694 --> 28:28.161
this claims that Katie's
an unfit mother.

28:28.197 --> 28:29.830
You were traveling for work,

28:29.865 --> 28:31.309
and Haley broke her arm
at the playground.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.633
Where was Katie?
- She was in a meeting.

28:33.669 --> 28:35.101
Her phone was off.
- So you'd think

28:35.137 --> 28:37.003
she'd be more mindful
in the future,

28:37.039 --> 28:39.906
but when her son wandered off
from camp two years later,

28:39.942 --> 28:41.675
she didn't even bother
calling them back

28:41.710 --> 28:43.643
for three hours.
- She didn't get the message!

28:43.679 --> 28:46.012
Well, when you got
the message, you drove up there

28:46.048 --> 28:48.481
like a rocket to go find him.
- Harvey, you're twisting

28:48.482 --> 28:49.848
the facts here.
- No.

28:49.884 --> 28:52.045
I am getting your children.
- Not this way, you're not.

28:52.071 --> 28:54.672
I know this
doesn't feel good,

28:54.707 --> 28:56.136
but you said it:
we need a howitzer.

28:56.137 --> 28:57.503
This is it.
- I don't care.

28:57.538 --> 28:59.271
- Marcus...
- Katie is a good mother.

28:59.306 --> 29:01.039
She loves those kids.

29:01.075 --> 29:02.619
I'm not gonna let you
say these things about her.

29:02.643 --> 29:05.043
Damn it, Marcus,
there's no other way.

29:05.079 --> 29:07.412
You're the best goddamn
closer in New York.

29:07.448 --> 29:09.148
Isn't that what you always say?

29:09.183 --> 29:11.617
Well, the best goddamn closer
would find another way.

29:15.523 --> 29:16.989
Hey, Dad.

29:17.024 --> 29:19.224
Got you some churros.

29:20.227 --> 29:22.194
Thanks, but I gotta say,

29:22.229 --> 29:24.307
I thought you'd be here
an hour ago begging to go home.

29:24.331 --> 29:27.032
Well, Samantha and I went
to Otto's Tacos to celebrate.

29:27.067 --> 29:29.334
- Celebrate what?
- Her destroying this dude

29:29.370 --> 29:32.104
in a deposition all because
of what I gave her.

29:32.139 --> 29:33.772
She said I did great.
- What do you mean,

29:33.807 --> 29:35.807
"what you gave her"?
- Well, I overheard this guy

29:35.843 --> 29:38.277
telling his lawyer that
they stole our drug formula,

29:38.312 --> 29:39.811
and then I just...
- Wait a second,

29:39.847 --> 29:41.691
you overheard this?
- I didn't just overhear it,

29:41.715 --> 29:43.348
I recorded it.

29:43.384 --> 29:45.284
And then Samantha used it
in a deposition.

29:45.319 --> 29:46.785
Well, she didn't
really use it,

29:46.820 --> 29:49.183
she just threatened to use it,
which I thought

29:49.184 --> 29:50.728
was pretty badass...
- I want you to stay

29:50.752 --> 29:52.719
the hell away from that woman.
- What?

29:52.754 --> 29:53.964
- You heard me.
- Wait, aren't you the one

29:53.988 --> 29:55.988
who wanted us to work together
in the first place?

29:56.024 --> 29:57.724
Not to work together,
keep an eye on you,

29:57.759 --> 29:59.603
and definitely not use you.
- She didn't use me.

29:59.627 --> 30:00.838
I volunteered.
- You don't know what she did

30:00.862 --> 30:03.896
because you're 15 years old.
- Well, I may only be 15,

30:03.932 --> 30:06.332
but I actually came in here
to admit that I was wrong

30:06.367 --> 30:08.045
for not wanting to come
into work with you,

30:08.069 --> 30:09.702
and that now I can't wait
until tomorrow.

30:09.738 --> 30:11.115
Well, tomorrow's not gonna
be like today,

30:11.139 --> 30:13.372
because you're gonna stay away
from that woman.

30:13.408 --> 30:16.843
- You can't make me do that!
- You'd better believe I can.

30:22.117 --> 30:24.617
You really are a piece of work,
aren't you?

30:24.652 --> 30:26.197
I'm sorry, shouldn't you
be coming in here

30:26.221 --> 30:28.087
to thank me for taking care
of your daughter?

30:28.123 --> 30:30.389
If you think what you did
is what "taking care of" means,

30:30.425 --> 30:32.291
I hope you never get
a goddamn house plant,

30:32.327 --> 30:35.061
let alone a child.
- Excuse me?

30:35.096 --> 30:36.763
Joy told me about
the stunt you pulled,

30:36.798 --> 30:38.631
and how you told her
she did a great job.

30:38.666 --> 30:40.733
Well, did you also tell her
it's illegal to record

30:40.769 --> 30:43.069
someone else's conversation?
- It is not illegal

30:43.104 --> 30:44.604
to record sound
in a public space.

30:44.639 --> 30:46.083
That's not what happened
and you know it.

30:46.107 --> 30:47.039
Well, it doesn't matter,
because I didn't use

30:47.075 --> 30:48.285
the recording
because I didn't need to.

30:48.309 --> 30:50.643
Oh, I know that,
because if you had,

30:50.678 --> 30:51.956
we'd have a whole other set
of problems right now.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.045
And what would those be?

30:53.081 --> 30:55.615
Because was I did
was completely within

30:55.650 --> 30:57.394
the bounds of the law.
- You don't get it, do you?

30:57.418 --> 30:58.951
I trusted you with my daughter

30:58.987 --> 31:00.331
who's been getting in trouble
and lying,

31:00.355 --> 31:02.188
and then she does something
like this.

31:02.223 --> 31:03.901
And instead of you telling her
it was wrong, you gave her

31:03.925 --> 31:05.758
a goddamn cookie.
- What I did was treat her

31:05.794 --> 31:07.827
like an adult and show her
how the world works.

31:07.862 --> 31:09.662
Well, she's not an adult,
and she can learn

31:09.697 --> 31:11.142
how the world works
when you and I did,

31:11.166 --> 31:12.965
and that's not 15.
- Some of us learned

31:13.001 --> 31:14.145
a hell of a lot younger
than that.

31:14.169 --> 31:15.613
Well, you must have had
a shitty upbringing,

31:15.637 --> 31:18.404
because a parent's job
isn't to teach their kids

31:18.439 --> 31:20.173
how the world is.

31:20.208 --> 31:22.119
A parent's job is to teach them
how the world should be.

31:22.143 --> 31:24.410
Well, her parent asked me
to get through to her

31:24.445 --> 31:26.245
in the first place
because he couldn't

31:26.281 --> 31:28.848
do it himself.
- Well...

31:28.883 --> 31:30.449
that's on me to grapple with.

31:30.485 --> 31:32.318
In the meantime,
stay the hell away

31:32.353 --> 31:34.821
from my daughter.

31:44.222 --> 31:45.833
Good morning, Gretchen.
How are you this...

31:45.857 --> 31:47.723
I'm busy, Louis,
just like you'd better get.

31:47.759 --> 31:49.637
Which is what I'm doing here.
- Wait, slow it down.

31:49.661 --> 31:51.561
What are you talking about?
- The Nielson depo

31:51.596 --> 31:53.496
got moved up to tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

31:53.531 --> 31:55.743
Yes, and Joan Walsh wants
her quarterly update yesterday.

31:55.767 --> 31:58.468
There are 16 other things
waiting for you in your office.

31:58.503 --> 32:00.314
You got lunch with Sheila
at 1:00, and I don't know

32:00.338 --> 32:01.649
what the hell...
- Stop right there.

32:01.673 --> 32:02.572
You need to reschedule half
of those things.

32:02.607 --> 32:04.373
That brings me
to the last thing:

32:04.409 --> 32:06.409
I gotta go to the dentist.
- What?

32:06.444 --> 32:08.478
Gretchen, no,
you can't leave me like this.

32:08.513 --> 32:09.779
Did you hear me?

32:09.814 --> 32:12.582
I got a hole in my tooth
the size of Colorado.

32:12.617 --> 32:14.650
And before you ask me
to call Lipschitz

32:14.686 --> 32:16.385
because you can't handle
the pressure,

32:16.421 --> 32:18.087
he's out of town
till next week.

32:18.122 --> 32:20.590
Good luck.

32:20.625 --> 32:22.391
Good mudding, Louis.

32:22.427 --> 32:24.371
- Good mudding, Louis.
- Hey, Louis, good mudding.

32:24.395 --> 32:27.230
And good mudding to you.
- Top of the mudding to you.

32:27.265 --> 32:28.764
- Good mudding.
- Good mudding.

32:28.800 --> 32:29.532
Good mudding.

32:29.567 --> 32:30.867
Hey, Louis, good mudding.

32:30.902 --> 32:32.635
<i>Mudding...mudding...</i>

32:42.580 --> 32:46.249
So what's on the agenda
for today?

32:46.284 --> 32:48.384
Nothing.

32:48.419 --> 32:49.930
After last night's lecture,
I didn't think

32:49.954 --> 32:52.188
I'd be seeing you today.
- Yeah, well, my dad told me

32:52.223 --> 32:53.289
to stay away from you,

32:53.324 --> 32:54.590
but he doesn't know anything.

32:54.626 --> 32:56.559
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

32:56.594 --> 32:58.861
He's an asshole.
- Don't say that.

32:58.897 --> 33:00.696
Why not?
It's the truth.

33:00.732 --> 33:03.199
I learned more from you
than any adult ever,

33:03.234 --> 33:05.101
so if he wants me
to stay away from you,

33:05.136 --> 33:07.537
he's wrong.
- No...

33:07.572 --> 33:10.072
Joy, he's not.

33:10.108 --> 33:12.542
I'm the one who was wrong.

33:12.577 --> 33:15.311
That car I boosted
when I was 14?

33:15.346 --> 33:17.580
I didn't tell you
the other half of it.

33:17.615 --> 33:20.249
I didn't just get suspended;
I got expelled.

33:20.285 --> 33:21.584
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

33:21.619 --> 33:24.554
And after that, I had a choice:
either get my shit together

33:24.589 --> 33:26.622
or get nowhere in life.

33:26.658 --> 33:30.493
So by the time I was a senior,
I got a scholarship and...

33:30.528 --> 33:31.494
that's how I was able
to go to college

33:31.529 --> 33:32.895
in the first place.

33:32.931 --> 33:34.931
Well, I don't need
a scholarship. My dad's rich.

33:34.966 --> 33:37.567
And if you think that's
your father's value,

33:37.602 --> 33:40.570
you don't know anything.

33:40.605 --> 33:41.837
Whether you see it or not,

33:41.873 --> 33:43.005
he is looking out for you.

33:43.041 --> 33:44.251
He doesn't look out
for me, okay?

33:44.275 --> 33:46.353
He just tells me what to do.
- Telling you what to do

33:46.377 --> 33:48.144
is looking out for you.

33:48.179 --> 33:49.823
As someone who didn't
have anyone telling me

33:49.847 --> 33:53.249
what to do when I could have
really used it...

33:53.284 --> 33:56.118
you have no idea
how lucky you are.

33:56.154 --> 33:57.587
So whether you want

33:57.622 --> 33:59.322
to listen to him or not, I do,

33:59.357 --> 34:02.592
and we're not
working together anymore.

34:02.627 --> 34:04.527
I didn't think
you'd take his side.

34:04.562 --> 34:07.330
What can I say, turns out
your father's pretty smart.

34:07.365 --> 34:10.366
You should listen to him
sometime.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.534
Maybe I will.

34:11.569 --> 34:13.869
I mean, he was right
about one thing this week...

34:13.905 --> 34:15.638
Yeah? What's that?

34:15.672 --> 34:17.607
You are the cool one.

34:17.641 --> 34:20.476
Joy, what I'm trying
to tell you...

34:20.511 --> 34:23.779
is I think maybe your dad
is the cool one.

34:34.025 --> 34:35.858
- Mind if I sit?
- Harvey, I told you,

34:35.893 --> 34:38.393
I'm not talking to you
without my lawyer.

34:38.429 --> 34:40.830
And I tried to tell you
that lawyers

34:40.864 --> 34:42.998
only make things ugly.

34:43.034 --> 34:45.568
Here's proof.

34:45.603 --> 34:48.404
- What is this?
- It's a list of all the times

34:48.438 --> 34:49.672
you put those kids at risk.

34:49.706 --> 34:53.309
- This is bullshit.
- Maybe, but it's the kind

34:53.344 --> 34:55.244
of bullshit that works
in court.

34:55.279 --> 34:57.591
- You wouldn't do this to me.
- You'd better believe I would,

34:57.615 --> 34:58.981
because I care
about those kids,

34:59.017 --> 35:02.018
and I know they both need you
and Marcus in their lives.

35:02.053 --> 35:03.931
Well, then maybe Marcus
should have thought about that

35:03.955 --> 35:06.689
before he did what he did.
- Yeah, he should have.

35:06.724 --> 35:08.057
But he's thinking about it now,

35:08.092 --> 35:11.794
which is why as much
as I'd like to use this...

35:12.864 --> 35:15.031
He won't let me.
- What?

35:15.066 --> 35:17.733
I told him this
was the only way.

35:17.769 --> 35:19.780
He told me to find another one
because he doesn't want

35:19.804 --> 35:21.971
to hurt you any more
than he already has.

35:24.075 --> 35:26.575
Katie...

35:26.611 --> 35:29.278
he loves you...

35:29.313 --> 35:30.880
and whether or not
you're willing

35:30.915 --> 35:33.783
to give the marriage
another chance...

35:33.818 --> 35:36.886
he deserves another chance
as a father.

35:38.890 --> 35:40.623
I never thought I'd hear
something like that

35:40.658 --> 35:42.358
from Harvey Specter.

35:42.393 --> 35:45.461
Well, if there's one thing
I've come around on,

35:45.496 --> 35:47.463
when it comes to family,
forgiveness

35:47.498 --> 35:49.665
is a hell of a lot better
than anger.

35:51.969 --> 35:54.603
I'll think about it.

35:54.639 --> 35:57.540
That's the most I can ask.

36:11.489 --> 36:14.390
- Hey.
- Louis, it's past 3:00.

36:14.425 --> 36:16.292
We were supposed to go to lunch
two hours ago.

36:16.327 --> 36:18.561
I know.
Work was a shit-show

36:18.596 --> 36:20.496
so I--I got you these

36:20.531 --> 36:23.599
to say I'm sorry.
- Oh...

36:23.634 --> 36:24.734
they're beautiful.

36:24.769 --> 36:26.669
And I have a gift for you too.
- Oh, yeah?

36:26.704 --> 36:28.437
What kind of gift?
- The best kind.

36:28.473 --> 36:30.072
You don't have
to give up mudding

36:30.108 --> 36:31.974
because I've decided
to get my tubes tied.

36:32.009 --> 36:33.676
What?
Why would you...?

36:33.711 --> 36:35.122
Because clearly mudding
is more important to you

36:35.146 --> 36:37.012
than having a baby,
so I thought,

36:37.048 --> 36:38.748
"Why not make it easier
for both of us?"

36:38.783 --> 36:40.583
- Sheila, that's not...
- You're gonna tell me

36:40.618 --> 36:42.818
that's not mud
under your fingernails?

36:43.788 --> 36:46.422
All right, it is--
but it was just one last time.

36:46.457 --> 36:47.468
And how can I trust
that that's true?

36:47.492 --> 36:48.958
Because I just told you,

36:48.993 --> 36:51.494
work was fucking crazy.

36:51.529 --> 36:53.529
Gretchen was coming at me
with 1,000 things.

36:53.564 --> 36:54.775
You don't understand.
- I do understand,

36:54.799 --> 36:57.900
because I'm the one
who asked her to come at you.

37:00.705 --> 37:02.538
So let me just
get this straight:

37:02.573 --> 37:04.673
you didn't trust me,
so you did this to me.

37:04.709 --> 37:07.676
No, I didn't do anything
to you.

37:07.712 --> 37:09.178
You made me a promise.

37:09.213 --> 37:11.013
All you had to do was let go
of one thing,

37:11.048 --> 37:12.960
and you couldn't do it.
- Well, it was a big thing,

37:12.984 --> 37:14.850
and I don't even know
if it's the only thing.

37:14.886 --> 37:17.887
Now, let me
get this straight:

37:17.922 --> 37:20.990
you can't put the needs
of our child...

37:21.025 --> 37:22.958
above your own.
- I'm not saying that.

37:22.994 --> 37:24.171
Okay, then what
are you saying?

37:24.195 --> 37:25.372
Because I may not be
a mother yet, but I know

37:25.396 --> 37:28.497
that's what parenthood means--
- So do I.

37:28.533 --> 37:30.199
Then what happens
the first time he's sick

37:30.234 --> 37:31.600
when we have tickets
to the ballet?

37:31.636 --> 37:33.903
Or there's a deposition
at the same time

37:33.938 --> 37:34.804
as a parent-teacher conference?

37:34.839 --> 37:36.105
- Those are different.
- How?

37:36.140 --> 37:37.818
Because I would be
giving those things up for him,

37:37.842 --> 37:39.575
not for...

37:39.610 --> 37:41.477
For me.

37:41.512 --> 37:43.712
No, you're not giving
any of it up for me.

37:43.748 --> 37:46.582
You're giving these things up
to have a child.

37:46.617 --> 37:47.928
Do you want to know
what I'm giving up?

37:47.952 --> 37:49.652
Coffee...

37:49.687 --> 37:51.220
and drinking...

37:51.255 --> 37:53.222
and cheese,
and my hair color--

37:53.257 --> 37:55.991
not to mention the pain
of pushing another human being

37:56.027 --> 37:57.860
out of my body.

37:57.895 --> 37:59.706
So if you're not ready to make
this one little sacrifice,

37:59.730 --> 38:01.530
then you're not ready...

38:01.566 --> 38:03.899
to have a child.

38:07.805 --> 38:10.506
Sheila, I'm sorry.

38:11.776 --> 38:14.243
I wasn't thinking,
and I won't--I won't--

38:14.278 --> 38:16.111
I'll just get rid
of my membership today.

38:16.147 --> 38:19.114
No, you don't have to give up
your membership, Louis.

38:19.150 --> 38:21.116
You just have to stop
till we get pregnant.

38:21.152 --> 38:22.718
Don't you see?

38:22.753 --> 38:24.520
If I keep it...

38:24.555 --> 38:27.056
I'll be tempted.

38:27.091 --> 38:29.592
Sheila, having a family
is far more important to me

38:29.627 --> 38:31.794
than going mudding.

38:31.829 --> 38:33.195
Okay, good.

38:43.007 --> 38:45.140
Let me guess:
you fixed everything,

38:45.176 --> 38:46.609
and you're calling me
to tell Robert

38:46.644 --> 38:48.444
that you'll be back
in the morning.

38:48.479 --> 38:49.445
<i>Okay, mind reader.</i>

38:49.480 --> 38:52.047
What do I have to say to that?

38:52.083 --> 38:54.483
I don't know, Harvey, but...

38:54.518 --> 38:55.951
I'm glad you went.

38:55.987 --> 38:57.820
To tell you the truth...

38:57.855 --> 38:58.966
it was one
of the hardest things

38:58.990 --> 39:01.056
I've ever had to do.

39:01.092 --> 39:02.958
I swear it took
a piece of me, Donna.

39:02.994 --> 39:05.661
Well, you could look at it
that way,

39:05.696 --> 39:07.997
or you could look at it
like you chose

39:08.032 --> 39:09.665
to give a piece of yourself.

39:09.700 --> 39:11.066
That's pretty good.

39:11.102 --> 39:12.668
You should be a philosopher.

39:12.703 --> 39:15.738
And who's to say I'm not?

39:15.773 --> 39:17.840
Oh, now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to give a piece

39:17.875 --> 39:19.675
<i>of something to someone else.</i>

39:19.710 --> 39:21.744
Thank you, Donna.

39:30.821 --> 39:33.989
Donna, no offense,
but a cup of coffee

39:34.025 --> 39:35.858
is the last thing
I need right now.

39:35.893 --> 39:37.960
Among other things,
I'm trying to give up caffeine.

39:37.995 --> 39:41.130
I know that, Louis...

39:41.165 --> 39:44.600
and that's not coffee.

39:46.337 --> 39:47.703
Oh, my God,
don't tell me it's...

39:47.738 --> 39:49.672
Iron-rich Peruvian
ground silt heated

39:49.707 --> 39:51.140
to the recommended temperature

39:51.175 --> 39:53.309
of 102.68 degrees Fahrenheit.
- Sheila told you

39:53.344 --> 39:54.810
I sold my membership,
didn't she?

39:54.845 --> 39:55.778
She did, and I have to say
I think that's

39:55.813 --> 39:59.114
the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

39:59.150 --> 40:00.349
Thanks, Donna.

40:00.384 --> 40:02.117
And thanks for this.

40:02.153 --> 40:03.819
One more thing.

40:03.854 --> 40:05.332
Something tells me
that you're gonna need this

40:05.356 --> 40:08.624
for coffee
sooner than you think.

40:11.195 --> 40:12.628
Good night, Louis.

40:29.380 --> 40:31.146
You have a minute?

40:31.182 --> 40:33.160
- Depends on what it's for.
- I shouldn't have said

40:33.184 --> 40:35.384
what I said
about your upbringing.

40:36.287 --> 40:39.188
- And?
- Whatever you said to Joy...

40:39.223 --> 40:41.991
I appreciate it.
- I'm glad.

40:42.026 --> 40:45.060
Is it true, what you told her
about family?

40:45.096 --> 40:48.030
I don't want to talk to you
about my childhood, Alex.

40:48.065 --> 40:50.933
What is true
is you're a good father.

40:50.968 --> 40:53.102
I overstepped my bounds.
I'm sorry.

40:53.137 --> 40:55.104
Aww, shit...

40:55.139 --> 40:56.105
- What?
- I told you I'm trying

40:56.140 --> 40:58.574
to teach Joy
to do the right thing,

40:58.609 --> 41:00.209
but I haven't done right
by you.

41:00.244 --> 41:02.055
You told me Zane promised
your name would be next

41:02.079 --> 41:03.946
on that wall,
but I didn't tell you

41:03.981 --> 41:07.349
that Harvey promised me
the exact same thing.

41:09.987 --> 41:12.187
Well...

41:12.223 --> 41:13.856
now that you have,
you wanna give it up?

41:13.891 --> 41:14.857
No.

41:14.892 --> 41:16.191
- You?
- No.

41:16.227 --> 41:17.860
- You wanna share it together?
- No.

41:17.895 --> 41:19.294
Me either.

41:19.330 --> 41:21.096
I guess there's only one thing
left to say.

41:21.132 --> 41:23.799
I guess there is.

41:23.834 --> 41:27.202
- When the time comes...
- May the best woman win.
