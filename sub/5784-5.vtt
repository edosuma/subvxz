WEBVTT

00:45.378 --> 00:48.480
I'm merely stating that

00:48.482 --> 00:51.283
given that the film was based
on a Jules Verne novel,

00:51.285 --> 00:53.886
they could pay
at least cursory attention

00:53.888 --> 00:56.088
to scientific plausibility.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.557
I believe it's meant
for children, William.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.959
Precisely. You wouldn't want
them to go through life

01:00.961 --> 01:03.295
with a distorted
understanding of physics.

01:03.297 --> 01:06.432
So it's not possible to reach
the moon by way of canon?

01:06.434 --> 01:09.401
Even if enough force
could be summoned,

01:09.403 --> 01:11.937
the acceleration
would crush you.

01:11.939 --> 01:15.374
I can't even begin to discuss
the gravitational issues.

01:15.376 --> 01:18.143
(chuckling): I thought you
said you loved this book

01:18.145 --> 01:20.612
as a child.
Well, I know better now.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.990
You're right.

01:31.992 --> 01:34.193
We're being followed.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.195
Hey, don't look now!
How do you know?

01:36.197 --> 01:38.263
He's been following us
since the theatre.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.799
How many turns have we taken
since leaving the theatre?

01:40.801 --> 01:43.068
Four.
Well, assuming

01:43.070 --> 01:45.237
three degrees of freedom
at every turn...

01:45.239 --> 01:48.173
3 to the power of 4...
81.

01:48.175 --> 01:50.742
One person in 81 would
take this route.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.945
Yes, but not all
routes are equal.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.180
The odds of two parties taking
this exact route are--

01:55.182 --> 01:57.182
It's impossible to calculate.

01:57.184 --> 01:59.051
Well, not impossible.
Come this way.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.430
There you have it.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.532
He didn't even look
in our direction.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.734
I find that curious.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.936
He was being a gentleman.

02:17.938 --> 02:21.306
He assumed two lovers
stealing into the shadows.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.542
Mm-hmm...
(giggling)

02:23.544 --> 02:25.811
I think you should
take me home.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.315
(chuckling)

02:30.317 --> 02:32.384
(gasp)
William!

02:32.386 --> 02:35.521
Who are you?
You've been following us?

02:35.523 --> 02:39.191
I demand to know why.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.193
Get in, please.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.328
Not without an explanation.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.198
One will be forthcoming.
They only want you.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.801
Where he goes, I go.
As you wish.

03:00.613 --> 03:04.016
Ah, Detective Murdoch.
Terrence Meyers.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.552
I might have known
you'd be behind this.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.954
(Julia): William.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.889
Prime Minister.
Detective Murdoch,

03:10.891 --> 03:13.959
I apologize for the way you were summoned.
Circumstances require it.

03:13.961 --> 03:18.163
Allow me to introduce my wife,
Dr. Julia Ogden.

03:18.165 --> 03:21.166
I'm pleased to
meet you, Doctor.
It's an honour.

03:21.168 --> 03:24.102
I'm afraid what we have to say
is not for the citizenry.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.638
I know this woman, sir.
I believe she can be trusted.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.975
Very well. A crisis
has arisen, Detective.

03:29.977 --> 03:33.512
We have less than 20 hours.
20 hours to what?

03:33.514 --> 03:35.647
To save Canada.

03:42.455 --> 03:45.057
"Project D has been activated.
Unless payment

03:45.059 --> 03:48.827
of $4 million is made
by 6 p.m. tomorrow,

03:48.829 --> 03:51.563
New York will burn."
He goes on to provide

03:51.565 --> 03:54.066
instructions on how
payment is to be made.

03:54.068 --> 03:57.102
You received this?
Four hours ago.

03:57.104 --> 04:00.239
What is Project D?
Project D doesn't exist.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.507
Not officially, anyway.
It was an idea,

04:02.509 --> 04:04.910
tabled at a cabinet meeting
two years ago

04:04.912 --> 04:07.446
by then Defence Minister
William Fergus.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.615
What does D stand for?
Defence.

04:09.617 --> 04:12.017
Although "Doomsday" may
be more appropriate.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.052
This project called
for a policy

04:14.054 --> 04:16.855
of guaranteed reciprocal
annihilation.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.591
A series of enormous guns are
right along the border,

04:19.593 --> 04:23.228
capable of delivering an
explosive device up
to 400 miles.

04:23.230 --> 04:26.865
So if one country starts
a war, both are mutually
assured destruction?

04:26.867 --> 04:29.268
After this meeting,
a decision was made

04:29.270 --> 04:31.503
to move Mr. Fergus
to a safer ministry.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.273
Industrial development.
He was supposed

04:34.275 --> 04:37.276
to oversee construction
of a federal shipping yard.

04:37.278 --> 04:40.078
We assumed everything was going
according to plan...

04:40.080 --> 04:42.748
Until certain irregularities
came to our attention.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.150
Irregularities.
Of a nature that suggested

04:45.152 --> 04:48.120
Project D, in fact,
was being built.

04:48.122 --> 04:50.722
Unfortunately, by the time
we started

04:50.724 --> 04:53.925
an investigation, most of the
pertinent documents had
been removed.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.428
And the minister himself?
He has disappeared.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.564
We followed him here to
Toronto, but he's now eluded us.

04:59.566 --> 05:02.801
And you believe this minister
to be behind this extortion?

05:02.803 --> 05:05.804
That's what we're hoping
you can determine.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.707
Meyers, you know
how to reach me.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.610
Sir.
Right, our first priority

05:11.612 --> 05:13.612
is to find the minister
and talk to him.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.614
Do you have a photograph
of this Fergus fellow?

05:15.616 --> 05:18.116
And where does he usually stay
when he's in town?

05:18.118 --> 05:21.186
Queen's Hotel. But he hasn't
checked in yet.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.488
What are his habits?
If he's in hiding,

05:23.490 --> 05:26.491
he'll change where he stays
but not how he travels, or

05:26.493 --> 05:29.294
the food he likes to eat.
He likes to travel by coach,

05:29.296 --> 05:31.697
as I understand, and he likes

05:31.699 --> 05:34.733
his steaks bloody, or so I'm
told. I've never actually
broken bread with the man.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.436
We'll see that the local
hotels are apprised.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.604
And steakhouses.
And steakhouses.

05:39.606 --> 05:42.207
Murdoch.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.409
The future of Canada
is in peril.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.411
We have less than 20 hours.

05:46.413 --> 05:49.948
I don't believe time
to be an issue.

05:49.950 --> 05:53.752
The trajectory of a projectile
is a function

05:53.754 --> 05:57.923
of three variables: distance,
velocity and angle.

05:57.925 --> 06:01.793
Assuming the angle
for maximum range,

06:01.795 --> 06:05.364
we arrive at a muzzle velocity

06:05.366 --> 06:07.399
of 7000 feet

06:07.401 --> 06:09.968
per second. All of this
in a vacuum, of course.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.504
Your point?
No explosive force

06:12.506 --> 06:15.107
known to man could
propel a large missile

06:15.109 --> 06:18.009
anywhere near that speed.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.078
So it's impossible.
With today's technology,

06:20.080 --> 06:22.280
yes.
A hoax, then?

06:22.282 --> 06:24.282
Well that's a relief, then.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.385
So who's behind this?
The minister, I assume.

06:26.387 --> 06:29.421
Well, he initiated Project D,
brought it to your attention.

06:29.423 --> 06:33.291
What did he hope to gain?
Aside from $4 million?

06:33.293 --> 06:36.061
Follow the money.
Well, I say we call his bluff.

06:36.063 --> 06:39.865
Unless someone else
is responsible for this.

06:39.867 --> 06:43.668
Such as?
This letter was mailed from

06:43.670 --> 06:45.871
Toronto in the afternoon post.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.340
Who else is here in town that
knows about Project D?

06:50.676 --> 06:53.912
Myself, the Prime Minister and
the Deputy Minister,
Lester Mogg.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.349
I was signing off
on the purchase invoices

06:57.351 --> 07:00.852
for the shipyards when I found
these items included.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.822
Four-foot barrel sections?

07:03.824 --> 07:06.958
Made of high-temperature
steel.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.294
50 barrels of liquid hydrogen.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.630
Not exactly the kind
of materials

07:11.632 --> 07:13.665
one would need
to build a shipyard.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.168
So you figured Minister Fergus
was up to something?

07:16.170 --> 07:19.237
These items were being
diverted to a warehouse
in Oakville.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.706
We investigated that
warehouse. We found it empty.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.976
All the items had already
been removed.

07:24.978 --> 07:28.513
Mr. Mogg, I'm going to need
the details of every meeting

07:28.515 --> 07:31.082
Minister Fergus has had since
he began at that ministry.

07:31.084 --> 07:34.653
Every person he met with,
what was discussed.

07:34.655 --> 07:38.457
What's going on here, Murdoch?
Liquid hydrogen isn't
an explosive.

07:38.459 --> 07:41.193
It's a propellant.

07:41.195 --> 07:45.664
Project D isn't a projectile,
it's a rocket.

07:45.666 --> 07:49.100
The difference being?
A projectile, um --

07:49.102 --> 07:53.004
a bullet, or a cannonball --
expends its energy before
leaving the barrel.

07:53.006 --> 07:56.274
A rocket takes its energy
along with it,

07:56.276 --> 07:58.877
accelerating even after it
leaves the barrel.

07:58.879 --> 08:02.047
Now, a properly directed,
constantly accelerated mass

08:02.049 --> 08:05.350
could achieve the range
necessary to reach New York.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.552
Crikey.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.554
So this thing could
be real after all.

08:09.556 --> 08:12.424
How much time do we have?
16 hours.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.235
What have you, George?
A spot of luck, actually, sir.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.203
The    <i>maître </i>at
House of Beef remembers

08:25.205 --> 08:27.572
serving Minister Fergus.
Steak and mash, apparently.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.574
And after that?
Dessert, I would assume, sir.

08:29.576 --> 08:32.911
Something sweet.
I'm not talking
about the dessert, Crabtree.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.514
Well, he hired a hansom cab.
It took him to the King's Hotel.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.983
Is that where he was staying?
Well, that's just it.

08:37.985 --> 08:41.620
He's not listed as a guest.
He may have been using
a false name.

08:41.622 --> 08:44.422
Good work, George.
There's more, sir.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.992
According to ministry records,
Minister Fergus on several

08:46.994 --> 08:49.027
occasions met with
a Dr. Janice Kemps,

08:49.029 --> 08:51.229
but no minutes were
ever recorded.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.431
Have you attempted
to contact her?

08:53.433 --> 08:55.667
The medical college has no
record of a Janice Kemps.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.669
Well, I did find
an address for a Dr. Kemps

08:57.671 --> 08:59.638
at 2002 Trafalgar Road.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.573
Oakville.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.409
(insects buzzing)

09:04.411 --> 09:07.846
Dr. Kemps?!

09:07.848 --> 09:10.282
DR. JANICE KEMPS?

09:17.223 --> 09:20.425
Dr. Kemps!
This is private property.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.694
You must leave.
Detective Murdoch.

09:22.696 --> 09:26.398
I need to speak with you.
Dr. Kemps is not here.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.500
My name is Svetlana.

09:28.502 --> 09:30.468
When will she be returning?

09:30.470 --> 09:32.804
Soon.
Soon?

09:32.806 --> 09:35.840
This is a matter
of some urgency.

09:35.842 --> 09:38.076
He returns presently.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.946
He? Janice Kemps is a man?

09:46.719 --> 09:48.920
What is that?

09:48.922 --> 09:51.089
Is that a-a bird?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.725
Some kind of airplane?
Oh, you are wrong.

09:53.727 --> 09:57.095
It's a man.
An extraordinary man.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.338
(muttering): What in
the world?

10:30.096 --> 10:32.097
(Svetlana sighs)

10:32.099 --> 10:36.101
Dr. Janice Kemps.
It's an anagram.

10:36.103 --> 10:39.304
James Pendrick.
Hello, old friend.

10:46.979 --> 10:51.149
Do you see any
flecks or bright flashes?
Just a glint from your eyes.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.551
Do not joke. You were
above 30 000 feet.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.553
The pressure suit worked.

10:55.555 --> 10:58.790
Excuse me --
you were at 30 000 feet?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.859
I was in the stratosphere,
Murdoch.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.827
Where the sky above me was dark.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.130
How?
Hydrogen balloon,

11:05.132 --> 11:08.099
made of a special rubberized
fabric I found in Japan.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.902
Why?

11:10.904 --> 11:13.738
Why? May as well
ask why we take

11:13.740 --> 11:16.841
our next breath.
Let me rephrase the question.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.110
What has this to do
with Project D?

11:19.112 --> 11:22.947
Project D?

11:22.949 --> 11:26.451
Minister Fergus's
special project.

11:26.453 --> 11:29.320
My work for the minister is
top secret, Murdoch.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.057
I can't discuss it without
explicit authority.

11:32.059 --> 11:35.060
Mr. Pendrick, I've been
charged with finding a weapon,

11:35.062 --> 11:38.430
made of materials I believe
to have been shipped
to this address.

11:38.432 --> 11:41.066
Detective Murdoch,

11:41.068 --> 11:43.301
I would have thought that you
knew me better than to think

11:43.303 --> 11:46.171
that I, James Pendrick, would
ever build a weapon of any kind.

11:46.173 --> 11:49.040
Sections of
high-temperature steel,

11:49.042 --> 11:51.976
four feet in diameter, intended
for the barrel of a gun

11:51.978 --> 11:54.145
aimed at New York --
capable of firing

11:54.147 --> 11:56.147
a rocket carrying explosives.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.084
Well, there is a rocket.

11:59.086 --> 12:03.254
But it's not aimed at New York.

12:03.256 --> 12:06.658
It certainly isn't intended
to carry an explosive.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.660
What's it intended
to carry, then?

12:08.662 --> 12:12.263
Me.
You?

12:12.265 --> 12:15.433
The intent of my invention
is the exact opposite

12:15.435 --> 12:18.103
of war, Murdoch.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.904
I seek nothing less
than to be an ambassador

12:19.906 --> 12:22.607
to a world beyond our own --

12:22.609 --> 12:25.009
the moon, Murdoch.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.414
I intend to go to the moon.

12:31.717 --> 12:34.052
That'll be all, squire.
Sir?

12:34.054 --> 12:36.087
I've shown the photograph
to everybody.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.089
The concierge says he knows
Minister Fergus

12:38.091 --> 12:40.091
personally. He's sure he would
have remembered him.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.327
Go ahead, track down the
cabbies and the shoe-shine boys

12:42.329 --> 12:45.230
who serve this hotel. See if
anyone remembers what happened

12:45.232 --> 12:47.232
to the minister after he was
dropped off last night.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.234
Sure.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.503
Why would someone
take a cab to a hotel

12:51.505 --> 12:53.505
and then not go inside?

12:53.507 --> 12:55.540
Perhaps they were trying
to throw us off the scent.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.643
Or they arranged to meet
someone outside the hotel.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.912
Whatever for?

13:00.914 --> 13:02.781
Some meetings
are meant to be pri--

13:05.284 --> 13:07.952
--vate.

13:11.323 --> 13:14.926
Minister Fergus?
Yep.

13:18.063 --> 13:20.899
As you can see, the rocket
is intended to carry a man,

13:20.901 --> 13:23.902
not explosives.
Where is this rocket now?

13:23.904 --> 13:26.137
70 metres below our feet.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.940
When it is fired, it will
accelerate through
the launch tube

13:28.942 --> 13:31.075
at three times
the force of gravity.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.545
Your body will weigh
three times as much.

13:33.547 --> 13:36.548
I've tested myself. I can
handle it. We will continue

13:36.550 --> 13:38.550
to accelerate until we're
outside the atmosphere,

13:38.552 --> 13:42.053
where we'll carry momentum into
orbit over the North Pole,

13:42.055 --> 13:44.756
over Siberia, Mongolia...

13:44.758 --> 13:46.758
and when we reach
the South China Sea,

13:46.760 --> 13:50.028
the rocket will
begin to descend. At which point

13:50.030 --> 13:52.831
I will open
the door to the rocket
and, wearing my gliding suit,

13:52.833 --> 13:54.899
fly back to Earth,

13:54.901 --> 13:57.569
landing on the isle of Borneo.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.771
Borneo?

13:59.773 --> 14:02.574
And how long will this all take?
From takeoff to landing,

14:02.576 --> 14:04.909
2 hours, 45 minutes.

14:04.911 --> 14:07.612
That's a rather long time
in such an enclosed space.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.814
It is, and I must confess

14:09.816 --> 14:13.017
to suffering from bouts
of claustrophobia.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.220
And that's why we placed
the launch control

14:15.222 --> 14:18.256
inside the rocket itself.
If I'm going to launch myself

14:18.258 --> 14:20.992
into orbit in a tin can
the size of a coffin,

14:20.994 --> 14:23.328
I very much want
to choose the moment.

14:23.330 --> 14:26.798
Well, I am very impressed.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.301
Of course you are. But
I didn't do it alone, Murdoch.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.871
Here! This.

14:35.241 --> 14:37.442
<i>"The Exploration of Cosmc</i>
<i>Space by Means</i>

14:37.444 --> 14:40.411
<i>of Reaction Devices</i>
<i>by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky."</i>

14:40.413 --> 14:44.048
It outlines the means by which
man can travel to the planets.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.718
I had to travel to Russia
just to meet the man

14:46.720 --> 14:50.255
and ended up with
his brilliant daughter.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.892
My brilliance is like the moon
next to your sun.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.665
We made a proposal to the
Minister of Industrial
Development.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.635
Canada could lead the world
in space exploration.

15:03.637 --> 15:06.571
Imagine a Canadian flag
planted on the moon.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.274
He agreed to fund our project.
With the proviso

15:09.276 --> 15:13.111
that it be kept top secret.
Hence, Dr. Janice Kemps.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.313
James...

15:15.315 --> 15:18.483
Minister Fergus has no interest
in going to the moon.

15:18.485 --> 15:21.219
He intends to use all
of this technology

15:21.221 --> 15:24.822
to make a weapon capable
of reaching New York City.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.058
Impossible.

15:27.060 --> 15:30.662
Svetlana... the experiments.

15:30.664 --> 15:32.630
What experiments?

15:32.632 --> 15:35.433
Minister Fergus insisted
that we conduct

15:35.435 --> 15:37.669
careful experiments to determine
the range of the rocket.

15:37.671 --> 15:40.071
It became very exact.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.507
Aiming for and sinking a rocket
into Lake Abitibi,

15:42.509 --> 15:46.077
350 miles away.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.079
The exact distance
to New York City.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.882
Murdoch, I've been blind.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.484
Oh, my love--
No, I should have known.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.720
I have too much faith
in humanity.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.956
He'll tell you;
it's my fatal flaw.

16:00.926 --> 16:03.361
I will do anything
I can to help you.

16:05.864 --> 16:09.233
(indistinct chatter)

16:09.235 --> 16:11.235
Appears he was garrotted.

16:11.237 --> 16:14.105
There's no blood loss that I can
see, no visible wounds.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.107
Was he killed here, Doctor?

16:16.109 --> 16:17.976
I'll know more when
I do the post-mortem.

16:22.081 --> 16:24.282
(door closing)
Ms. James?

16:24.284 --> 16:27.418
I may need your assistance.
Are you able to take dictation?

16:27.420 --> 16:29.420
I can try.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.290
Gentlemen, prepare the corpse.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.293
James Pendrick
is behind all this?

16:35.295 --> 16:38.396
He didn't send the note.
And there is no weapon.

16:38.398 --> 16:41.199
Well, what about the
barrel sections?

16:41.201 --> 16:43.601
And the rocket fuel?
Yes, there is a rocket,

16:43.603 --> 16:45.603
but it's pointed north.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.039
So we've done all this running
around for nothing.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.841
Well, sir, someone is still
trying to extort

16:49.843 --> 16:52.043
millions from the government.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.911
And a federal minister
has been murdered.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.414
Best not forget that.
(knocking)

16:56.416 --> 16:58.449
Julia! What have you?

16:58.451 --> 17:01.085
Given the temperature
and the state of rigor,

17:01.087 --> 17:04.188
Minister Fergus was killed
between 9 and 10 o'clock
last night.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.158
And I've yet to examine the rest
of the contents,

17:07.160 --> 17:10.061
but I found this in his stomach.

17:10.063 --> 17:13.831
59.

17:13.833 --> 17:17.068
It's a locker key
from Union Station.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.672
If he took the trouble to
swallow that key,

17:21.674 --> 17:24.208
it behooves us to find out
what it opens. Agreed?

17:24.210 --> 17:26.244
(knocking)
Sirs?

17:26.246 --> 17:28.246
A shoeshine boy claims
he saw the Minister

17:28.248 --> 17:30.815
step into a carriage outside the
King's Hotel last night.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.051
What time was this?
About 9 o'clock.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.420
That's about the time
he was dropped off.

17:35.422 --> 17:38.089
And guess who's renting a
room at the King's Hotel?
Just tell us, Crabtree.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.625
Well, I have a guess.
Lester Mogg.

17:40.627 --> 17:44.429
Deputy Minister.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.265
(Murdoch): <i>Minister Fergus</i>
<i>arranged to meet.</i>

17:47.267 --> 17:49.867
<i>Why did you not tell us?</i>

17:49.869 --> 17:52.770
(Mogg): <i>He never showed up.</i>
<i>(Craig):</i> <i>And you didn't</i>
<i>think that pertinent?</i>

17:55.040 --> 17:58.876
What was the meeting about?
I was hoping to convince him

17:58.878 --> 18:01.546
to turn himself in.
Or perhaps you lured him to

18:01.548 --> 18:03.981
the hotel so you could kill him.
Why would I kill him?

18:03.983 --> 18:06.017
He was our only suspect.
Kill him

18:06.019 --> 18:08.019
and no suspicion
would fall on you.

18:08.021 --> 18:10.621
You think I'm behind all this?

18:10.623 --> 18:12.857
You knew about Project D.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.059
You gave us just enough
information

18:15.061 --> 18:17.261
to believe the weapon
had been built.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.098
And you killed the minister to
keep us from learning the truth.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.701
(small laugh)
I didn't.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.870
<i>Sir.</i>

18:25.872 --> 18:28.473
I've been to locker 59
at Union Station.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.475
Look at this.

18:30.477 --> 18:33.177
Is this Pendrick's rocket?
Yes.

18:33.179 --> 18:37.682
The same. But this one
is aimed at...

18:37.684 --> 18:40.118
122 degrees.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.321
Southeast.
What lies at that bearing?

18:52.798 --> 18:55.967
New York City.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.537
Mr. Ambassador.

18:59.539 --> 19:02.740
Prime Minister.

19:02.742 --> 19:06.177
Detective Murdoch. Terrence.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.679
To what do I owe
such esteemed company?

19:08.681 --> 19:11.282
(door creaking)
Please, sit.

19:11.284 --> 19:14.018
Alan Clegg is the ambassador?

19:14.020 --> 19:17.688
Can I offer you some Necco
wafers? Straight from
my hometown.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.958
Thank you, no. I'm afraid this
isn't a social visit,

19:20.960 --> 19:23.628
Ambassador.
In less than five hours,

19:23.630 --> 19:25.630
unless we can locate it first,

19:25.632 --> 19:28.199
a missile will be fired from
Canadian soil towards America.

19:28.201 --> 19:30.968
A missile?

19:30.970 --> 19:33.204
What kind?

19:33.206 --> 19:35.306
A rogue minister
has built a missile

19:35.308 --> 19:37.642
capable of reaching
New York City.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.977
Purely for defensive purposes.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.780
But now, someone has killed
the minister and is threatening

19:42.782 --> 19:45.049
to fire said rocket.

19:45.051 --> 19:47.251
What will it be carrying?

19:47.253 --> 19:50.521
Approximately 200 pounds
of TNT.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.925
We're telling you now so that
arrangements can be made

19:53.927 --> 19:57.328
on the ground
to minimize loss of life.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.131
I can say without rancor

20:00.133 --> 20:02.466
that while America appreciates
your candor,

20:02.468 --> 20:06.304
if this rocket is fired
and lives are lost,

20:06.306 --> 20:08.306
a state of war
will exist between

20:08.308 --> 20:10.908
the United States and Canada.

20:19.451 --> 20:22.153
What are our options,
gentlemen?

20:22.155 --> 20:25.089
We pay the ransom.
That is not an option.

20:25.091 --> 20:29.260
I understand, sir.
A $4 million hole wouldn't

20:29.262 --> 20:31.696
escape public scrutiny.
Are you suggesting

20:31.698 --> 20:34.432
I would choose destruction
of my country over my career?

20:34.434 --> 20:37.168
No. No, not at, at all, sir.

20:37.170 --> 20:40.638
I regret if you inferred that
I was inferring that--
Enough.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.040
You're a good spy, Meyers.

20:43.042 --> 20:46.177
Your skills as a toady
are sadly lacking.

20:46.179 --> 20:49.480
I won't bankrupt this country
in order to save it.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.916
$4 million would hardly
bankrupt the country, sir.

20:51.918 --> 20:55.653
And what about the next payment?
And the payment after that?

20:55.655 --> 20:57.655
Until we find this rocket,
the millions will flow

20:57.657 --> 21:00.391
like water down a drain.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.994
Prime Minister, if I may?

21:02.996 --> 21:05.796
The schematics of this second
rocket show it launching

21:05.798 --> 21:09.333
from an angle of 122.4 degrees.

21:09.335 --> 21:12.403
So, southeast.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.673
Assuming that the intended
target is lower Manhattan,

21:15.675 --> 21:18.075
I can trace back along
this bearing

21:18.077 --> 21:20.645
to where the rocket
is being launched from.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.913
But it could be anywhere
along this line?

21:22.915 --> 21:25.549
Yes, sir. That's why
I would need

21:25.551 --> 21:27.551
to calculate the expected
range of the rocket.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.754
Could you make
such a calculation?

21:29.756 --> 21:33.491
No. Well, yes. Yes.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.893
But I would have to return to
Mr. Pendrick's facility.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.296
Well, then, do so!
With all haste!

21:38.298 --> 21:40.898
Gentlemen.
Sir.

21:48.340 --> 21:51.142
Sorry if I'm interrupting.
It's quite alright, Julia.
What is it?

21:51.144 --> 21:53.344
Someone's interfered with
morgue evidence.

21:53.346 --> 21:56.380
Pertaining to which case?
The latest, I'm afraid.

21:56.382 --> 21:58.249
Minister Fergus.

22:06.024 --> 22:08.893
I always place the jar with the
label directly facing front.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.961
And this is?

22:13.065 --> 22:15.066
Mr. Fergus's stomach contents.

22:15.068 --> 22:17.468
Hmm...

22:17.470 --> 22:19.704
And when you returned?

22:19.706 --> 22:21.739
The label was skewed
to the right.

22:21.741 --> 22:24.241
What are these?

22:24.243 --> 22:27.478
I've yet to do my analysis.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.681
Hmm... No spy worth his name

22:30.683 --> 22:33.484
would leave such
an obvious indicator.

22:33.486 --> 22:35.486
He wanted us to find this.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.488
You think this was
the work of a spy?

22:37.490 --> 22:41.025
Of course. Likely one of our
own. He lacked sufficient time

22:41.027 --> 22:43.027
to alter the contents,
so he chose instead

22:43.029 --> 22:46.764
to adulterate them, leaving
a suspicion of said alteration.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.866
Unless, of course,
he anticipated

22:48.868 --> 22:51.068
we would make that assumption.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.070
Was there any sign
of a break-in?

22:53.072 --> 22:56.140
No.
Was there anyone else
in the morgue when you left?

22:56.142 --> 22:58.909
The morgue attendant,
possibly.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.045
Bring him to me.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.948
I'd like to interview him
personally.

23:09.888 --> 23:13.090
This is exactly the same
rocket as the one we built.

23:13.092 --> 23:16.260
I was hoping to determine its
range from these diagrams.

23:16.262 --> 23:19.029
Oh, if we know exact mass,
we can solve for distance

23:19.031 --> 23:21.465
using my father's equation.
Well, the plan calls

23:21.467 --> 23:24.268
for 200 pounds of TNT. I don't
know the tare weight
of the rocket.

23:24.270 --> 23:27.405
I do. This should take
just a few minutes.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.273
We're going to have
to scale this down.

23:34.045 --> 23:35.913
Here, here.

23:38.283 --> 23:40.885
Mississauga Road?
Just east of here. What of it?

23:45.891 --> 23:48.058
The carbon sheet must
have been folded,

23:48.060 --> 23:49.960
preventing the rest of the word
from printing through.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.332
"289 Miss."

23:55.334 --> 23:58.469
You think this could be
Mississauga Road?

23:58.471 --> 24:00.337
That's all we have.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.176
He had nothing to do
with this.

24:05.178 --> 24:07.511
He's worked with me for years.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.049
(door closing)
(telephone ringing)

24:12.051 --> 24:14.051
He won't talk.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.987
I may need to apply more
strenuous methods.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.523
I thought the Canadian
government foreswore

24:19.525 --> 24:21.725
the use of torture.

24:21.727 --> 24:25.930
Technically, I'm not part of
the Canadian government, Doctor.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.932
Just calm down.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.134
Who else has a key
to the morgue?

24:30.136 --> 24:32.470
The other morgue attendants,
but they'd already...

24:32.472 --> 24:35.239
Doctor?

24:35.241 --> 24:37.241
Excuse me, gentlemen.

24:37.243 --> 24:40.077
I need to test a theory.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.847
Based on assumed mass,
I've calculated

24:42.849 --> 24:44.982
distance of 349 miles.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.286
349 miles...

24:56.361 --> 24:58.362
Mississauga Road.

24:58.364 --> 25:00.164
It looks like your suspicions
were correct.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.066
Shall we?

25:11.910 --> 25:14.845
There's nothing here!

25:14.847 --> 25:17.281
Could we have missed it?

25:17.283 --> 25:20.651
The specifications call
for a launch muzzle

25:20.653 --> 25:24.722
and a control room
at a bearing of 122.4 degrees.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.924
We've passed nothing like that.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.994
Unless Ms. Tsiolkovsky's
calculations were wrong.

25:38.069 --> 25:40.938
Have a look at this.

25:40.940 --> 25:44.408
Svetlana's calculations.

25:44.410 --> 25:48.612
She used the distance to
calculate for the mass,

25:48.614 --> 25:51.949
instead of the mass
to calculate the distance.

25:51.951 --> 25:55.019
But how would she know
the distance?

25:55.021 --> 25:57.354
We spoke about
Mississauga Road.

25:57.356 --> 26:00.991
You think she deliberately
misled us to that location.

26:05.864 --> 26:08.499
How do I keep doing this?

26:08.501 --> 26:12.469
How can I, a man
of reason and intellect,

26:12.471 --> 26:14.872
possess such...

26:14.874 --> 26:18.909
terrible judgement
in those I trust...

26:18.911 --> 26:21.912
in those I give my heart to?

26:24.516 --> 26:26.517
We need to redo the
calculation.

26:26.519 --> 26:29.820
Yes, of course.
Forgive me my self-pity.

26:29.822 --> 26:33.490
(sighing): Let's get to work.

26:33.492 --> 26:35.359
(door closing)

26:38.096 --> 26:40.864
My landlady said
you asked to see me?

26:40.866 --> 26:43.467
Ms. James. Did you go into

26:43.469 --> 26:45.469
the evidence locker earlier
today, while I was out?

26:45.471 --> 26:50.140
Yes, I did.
Did you remove
any of the evidence?

26:50.142 --> 26:54.044
Yes, but just enough to
conduct my experiment.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.880
(sigh)
I was going to bring it back.

26:56.882 --> 27:00.851
Back? After you'd adulterated
it with your experiment?

27:00.853 --> 27:03.053
Ms. James, we've wasted an hour

27:03.055 --> 27:05.990
chasing imaginary spies
because of you.

27:05.992 --> 27:10.227
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.

27:10.229 --> 27:13.564
But I won't have someone working
for me that I can't trust.

27:13.566 --> 27:17.568
I won't file a complaint, but

27:17.570 --> 27:20.537
I must ask you
to hand in your key.

27:36.187 --> 27:39.223
What figure did you arrive at?
315 miles.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.091
So did I.

27:52.037 --> 27:53.904
Niagara-on-the-Lake.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.944
Look. It wasn't
Mississauga Road.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.280
Mississauga Street.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.083
We have to notify
the Niagara constabulary.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.985
They won't be able to stop the
missile. Only I can do that.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.887
We can't get there on time.

28:12.257 --> 28:15.459
She cut the phone line!
Of course she has.

28:15.461 --> 28:19.196
That won't impede us, Murdoch.
That only limits our options.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.166
What options?
Look at the wind gage.

28:22.168 --> 28:25.436
35 miles per hour.
From the north!

28:33.645 --> 28:36.113
I have an extra gliding suit,
Murdoch.

28:47.692 --> 28:50.060
What was she doing rifling
through the evidence locker?

28:50.062 --> 28:52.096
I believe she was
trying to help.

28:52.098 --> 28:55.199
That's her story.

28:55.201 --> 28:58.068
She's not a spy.
Of course she isn't.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.070
But she could well
be working for one.

29:00.072 --> 29:03.273
She's just a young woman who
showed poor judgement.

29:03.275 --> 29:06.677
So you're telling us the best
lead we had is now a dead end?

29:06.679 --> 29:10.848
I'm afraid so.
I guess it's all
up to Murdoch now.

29:10.850 --> 29:14.885
♪

29:23.261 --> 29:25.129
(Murdoch): Ah! Ah!

29:31.836 --> 29:34.471
Sir, that was Oakville
constabulary.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.473
Pendrick's facility's been
emptied out.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.609
The telephone line's been cut.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.844
I was afraid of this.

29:40.846 --> 29:43.180
What?

29:43.182 --> 29:46.383
Clearly, whoever's behind this
has cut off the lines of
communication

29:46.385 --> 29:49.219
and neutralized them.
Neutralized?

29:49.221 --> 29:51.889
Killed.

29:51.891 --> 29:55.092
It's a shame, really.
They were both good men.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.461
However, gentlemen, the fate
of the nation is now

29:57.463 --> 30:01.498
our prime concern
and if Murdoch is dead...

30:01.500 --> 30:03.934
then our last option is expired.

30:03.936 --> 30:06.303
We must inform
the prime minister.

30:08.540 --> 30:11.408
Bloody old Murdoch.
Where are ya?

30:16.948 --> 30:20.450
Both dead?
Most likely, sir.

30:20.452 --> 30:24.087
Sir, whoever is behind this
is clearly ruthless.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.290
If they were willing to kill
a crown minister,

30:26.292 --> 30:29.426
they wouldn't hesitate to kill
men of lesser importance.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.762
So there's only one course
of action remaining.

30:31.764 --> 30:33.964
I'm afraid so.

30:33.966 --> 30:36.900
I won't pretend
I'm not disappointed.

30:36.902 --> 30:39.303
Should have acted more quickly
when it first came to light.

30:39.305 --> 30:41.471
That was my error.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.674
How is payment to be made?

30:43.676 --> 30:46.743
$4 million in Dominion Bonds
are to be placed in a briefcase

30:46.745 --> 30:49.379
and left outside
Crawford's Pawn Shop.

30:49.381 --> 30:52.149
Right. Get to it.

30:52.151 --> 30:55.919
We have less than
half an hour.
Sir.

30:59.791 --> 31:02.059
Are you alright, Murdoch?
We parachuted late.

31:05.129 --> 31:07.598
I flew!

31:07.600 --> 31:10.100
I actually flew! Ha ha ha!

31:10.102 --> 31:13.337
Yeah. It's quite something,
isn't it?
Yes!

31:13.339 --> 31:15.272
The launch tube and control
room are over there.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.610
I flew!

31:19.612 --> 31:21.912
Svetlana!

31:21.914 --> 31:25.115
They've scuttled
the launch controls.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.618
[Help me!]
Svetlana.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.753
[James, you must help me.]

31:29.755 --> 31:32.022
Svetlana, where are you?

31:32.024 --> 31:34.358
[I'm in the barn. I've been
strapped to the launch tube.]

31:34.360 --> 31:36.693
My God!

31:36.695 --> 31:39.429
The missile's about to fire.

31:44.869 --> 31:48.438
A man will pick up this
suitcase and he will leave
with it. He's not to be arrested

31:48.440 --> 31:50.440
or detained in any way.
Is that understood?

31:50.442 --> 31:52.442
(all): Yes, sir.
Sir--

31:52.444 --> 31:54.444
We're not letting him get away
with it, Crabtree. We're letting

31:54.446 --> 31:57.648
him think he's getting away with
it. He gets on a streetcar?

31:57.650 --> 32:00.050
I want two constables sitting
three rows behind.

32:00.052 --> 32:02.486
If he changes streetcars,
one of you is to follow

32:02.488 --> 32:04.488
and the other one is
to arrange a replacement.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.490
You all know where
the call boxes are.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.725
Sir, what if he goes on foot?
Then it's the old

32:08.727 --> 32:11.295
follow-and-switch.
We do our jobs right,

32:11.297 --> 32:14.298
he won't even know.
Let's get to it.

32:14.300 --> 32:17.167
(all): Yes, sir.

32:21.639 --> 32:25.142
Svetlana!
James! James!

32:25.144 --> 32:27.911
(out of breath):
Ah, how did you find me?

32:30.248 --> 32:32.883
Who are you working for,
Ms. Tsiolkovsky?

32:32.885 --> 32:35.819
No, it's not what you think!
You don't want to know what
I'm thinking.

32:38.089 --> 32:40.123
I don't know his name.
He's from the government.

32:40.125 --> 32:43.093
He told me we would
split $4 million.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.962
He told me the rocket would
never have to fire.

32:44.964 --> 32:48.565
Why?
I did it for you, my love.

32:48.567 --> 32:52.269
Me?
You are the
greatest man I've ever known.

32:52.271 --> 32:54.771
What you could do
with $2 million...

32:54.773 --> 32:57.541
Forget the moon.
You could bring to mankind

32:57.543 --> 33:00.978
all the benefits of science.
A brave new world will
be yours to create.

33:00.980 --> 33:04.748
Not like this, Svetlana.
Never like this.

33:09.587 --> 33:11.888
We only have eight minutes
to stop it.

33:11.890 --> 33:14.224
No, there's no stopping it.
The clock is in the cone

33:14.226 --> 33:16.426
of the rocket. Once it's set,
there's no turning it off.

33:16.428 --> 33:19.730
What about the override?
No, the override has
been destroyed.

33:19.732 --> 33:22.733
Murdoch, I have to get
to that cone.

33:22.735 --> 33:24.935
How?

33:24.937 --> 33:28.305
There's only one way --
down the barrel.

33:28.307 --> 33:31.808
How far down is it?
70 metres. I'll have to slide.

33:35.747 --> 33:38.849
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
What is it?

33:38.851 --> 33:41.051
He suffers from fear
of enclosed spaces.

33:41.053 --> 33:44.021
It's OK. I'll, I'll get
over it. I need a moment.

33:44.023 --> 33:46.723
We don't have a moment,
Mr. Pendrick.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.229
Damn it, Murdoch.
I'll talk you through it.

34:01.806 --> 34:05.208
(echoing): Use the walls to
brace yourself!

34:05.210 --> 34:07.644
(thump)
(grunt)

34:19.123 --> 34:21.391
I can't get it off!

34:21.393 --> 34:24.261
It's a right-handed thread!

34:24.263 --> 34:26.696
(muttering): That's it.

34:30.701 --> 34:33.804
(dramatic music)
(indistinct chatter)

34:51.556 --> 34:54.157
Lester Mogg.

35:05.903 --> 35:09.172
(ticking)

35:09.174 --> 35:11.975
Which wire?

35:11.977 --> 35:15.245
Which wire?
Red. No, blue. No! Red.

35:15.247 --> 35:18.014
Pick one!

35:18.016 --> 35:20.851
Pick one?!

35:22.987 --> 35:26.656
(loud rumbling)
Pick the other one!

35:28.259 --> 35:30.694
(loud drone)

35:30.696 --> 35:33.630
He's done it. He's done it!

35:33.632 --> 35:37.601
Murdoch! Murdoch, you did it!

35:37.603 --> 35:40.003
Contact Station House
Number Four!

35:40.005 --> 35:41.872
(whispering): Thank you.

35:50.548 --> 35:52.616
The bollocks on this one.

35:52.618 --> 35:55.619
What?
Huh?

35:55.621 --> 35:57.821
Looks like he's daring us
to make a move.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.323
Exactly.
Sir.

36:00.325 --> 36:03.693
We've just been in touch with
Pendrick. Detective Murdoch's
disabled the rocket.

36:03.695 --> 36:07.230
Has he, now? Would you like
the honours, Terrence?

36:07.232 --> 36:09.099
You're very kind, Thomas.

36:18.409 --> 36:21.244
How many times do
I have to tell you?

36:21.246 --> 36:23.747
As many times as it takes to
convince me.

36:26.317 --> 36:29.519
I received a telephone call.
I don't know who it was...

36:29.521 --> 36:32.722
didn't recognize the voice.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.592
He told me I would find the
minister's papers in a briefcase

36:35.594 --> 36:38.428
outside of Crawford's Pawnshop.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.497
I was trying to help.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.202
Murdoch! Bloody good work.

36:45.204 --> 36:48.004
Likewise, sir. I understand we
have a suspect in custody?

36:48.006 --> 36:50.240
All we did was slap
the cuffs on him.

36:50.242 --> 36:53.443
You climbed down the barrel of
a bloody cannon, just as it was
about to be fired. And you flew!

36:53.445 --> 36:56.446
Oh, it was more akin to
plummeting, really.
Doctor!

36:56.448 --> 36:59.316
You would not believe what--
Uh, Julia! What have you?

36:59.318 --> 37:01.651
Ms. James has identified
the mysterious

37:01.653 --> 37:03.653
remnants I found in the
minister's stomach.

37:03.655 --> 37:06.690
Ms. James?
That's why she
removed the evidence.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.425
She was testing a theory!
What theory?

37:08.427 --> 37:10.627
They're Necco wafers.

37:10.629 --> 37:13.163
Only sold in the Boston area.

37:19.470 --> 37:22.072
Gentlemen!
Murdoch, if you will?

37:22.074 --> 37:24.474
We found these in the stomach

37:24.476 --> 37:26.676
contents of Minister Fergus.

37:26.678 --> 37:30.714
Necco wafers, from the Boston
area, I believe.

37:30.716 --> 37:33.617
That only proves that Minister
Fergus was here.

37:33.619 --> 37:36.019
I never suggested otherwise.

37:36.021 --> 37:39.122
We also believe these carpet
fibres will match

37:39.124 --> 37:41.124
your carpet.

37:41.126 --> 37:43.260
I'm sure they'll match those
of many carpets.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.262
Honestly, Gentlemen.
If you're trying--

37:45.264 --> 37:49.065
Would you bring her in,
please?

37:49.067 --> 37:52.869
Is this him?

37:52.871 --> 37:56.072
Yes, this is the man
of whom I spoke.

37:56.074 --> 37:59.209
He promised me the money.
So...

38:02.546 --> 38:05.348
What is it exactly about our
humble little country

38:05.350 --> 38:07.350
that you want so badly?

38:07.352 --> 38:10.854
Have you heard
of Svante Arrhenius?

38:10.856 --> 38:13.990
The Swedish scientist who
predicted that carbon dioxide

38:13.992 --> 38:16.693
emitted from coal burning would
warm global temperatures

38:16.695 --> 38:19.195
by 8 degrees by the end
of the century?

38:19.197 --> 38:21.431
In 100 years,

38:21.433 --> 38:23.600
when America is nothing but
a boundless desert,

38:23.602 --> 38:26.770
Canada will have
the ideal climate.

38:26.772 --> 38:30.807
How could I not do everything
I could to save my country?

38:30.809 --> 38:34.277
By bombing your own people?
It was aimed at the
Irish sector.

38:34.279 --> 38:38.214
Alan Clegg, you are
under arrest

38:38.216 --> 38:40.383
for the murder
of Minister Fergus.

38:40.385 --> 38:43.620
You seem to have forgotten
I have diplomatic immunity.

38:43.622 --> 38:46.790
Hmm... our prime minister
had a little chat

38:46.792 --> 38:49.826
with your president earlier.
Immunity's been waived.

38:49.828 --> 38:53.396
And I'm going to see
that you hang.

38:53.398 --> 38:55.899
Let's be having ya.

39:01.872 --> 39:03.740
(officer): Easy...

39:16.420 --> 39:19.622
Ms. James, I appreciate
your initiative,

39:19.624 --> 39:22.025
but why didn't you
simply tell me?

39:22.027 --> 39:24.394
We could have tested
your theory together.

39:24.396 --> 39:26.463
I didn't think it
was my place.

39:26.465 --> 39:29.265
I'm just a cleaner, after all.

39:29.267 --> 39:31.434
Well, I think we both
know that's not true.

39:31.436 --> 39:33.236
You have medical knowledge.

39:33.238 --> 39:35.705
How?

39:35.707 --> 39:38.074
I spent a year at the New York
Medical College for Women.

39:38.076 --> 39:41.811
Why didn't you finish?
My patron died.

39:41.813 --> 39:44.381
His son was less inclined to
support my schooling.

39:47.017 --> 39:50.653
Well, Ms. James, I can't hire
you back as a cleaner.

39:50.655 --> 39:52.589
I understand.

39:52.591 --> 39:55.658
But if I had an assistant

39:55.660 --> 39:58.828
who I could rely on...

39:58.830 --> 40:02.098
I haven't spoken to the city,

40:02.100 --> 40:04.434
so I don't know what I could
offer you in terms of a salary,

40:04.436 --> 40:07.837
but if you are interested--
Yes. Yes.

40:07.839 --> 40:11.107
(giggle)
(Pendrick): Will she hang?

40:11.109 --> 40:13.543
Oh, of course not.

40:13.545 --> 40:15.912
She'll probably have to spend
some time in jail.

40:18.149 --> 40:20.817
I'll wait for her.

40:20.819 --> 40:23.253
Whatever she did,
she did it for me.

40:23.255 --> 40:25.889
Perhaps I'm not

40:25.891 --> 40:28.057
such a bad judge
of character after all.

40:28.059 --> 40:31.694
(loud buzzing)

40:31.696 --> 40:34.731
(beeping)
Must be Meyers.

40:34.733 --> 40:37.500
He's in the launch room.

40:37.502 --> 40:39.803
I don't like him snooping
around in there.

40:49.914 --> 40:52.115
(whistle)

40:52.117 --> 40:55.652
I can't believe you're going to
destroy all this.

40:55.654 --> 40:58.021
The Americans are
insisting on it.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.594
Not before I'm done with it.

41:04.596 --> 41:07.397
I'm going to launch myself into
orbit, Murdoch. Tonight.

41:07.399 --> 41:09.299
Are you serious?

41:09.301 --> 41:11.301
I've already prepared the
system. All I have to do is get

41:11.303 --> 41:13.269
inside the rocket
and press the "go" switch.

41:13.271 --> 41:17.207
In six hours, I will be the
first man in space.

41:17.209 --> 41:19.909
(beeping)
(alarm sounding)

41:19.911 --> 41:22.912
(metallic buzzing)
What?!

41:22.914 --> 41:25.615
What is it?
He's inside the rocket!

41:25.617 --> 41:27.884
What?!
(alarm sounding)

41:27.886 --> 41:30.019
What the devil is he doing?

41:30.021 --> 41:32.388
(squeaking metal)

41:37.027 --> 41:39.329
(creaking)
(bang)

41:39.331 --> 41:42.265
(air escaping)

41:42.267 --> 41:45.702
Uh, oh.

41:45.704 --> 41:48.505
Hey. Hey!

41:50.441 --> 41:53.309
No. He couldn't have!

41:53.311 --> 41:56.913
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, HELP ME!

41:56.915 --> 41:59.048
No!
Meyers. Meyers!

42:05.022 --> 42:07.123
(low rumbling)

42:11.328 --> 42:13.696
(screaming)

42:23.240 --> 42:25.909
Damn.

42:25.911 --> 42:28.077
Indeed.

42:32.016 --> 42:34.050
William?
Mm-hmm?

42:34.052 --> 42:36.052
Had an interesting
conversation

42:36.054 --> 42:38.555
with the inspector today.

42:38.557 --> 42:41.491
You did?

42:41.493 --> 42:44.761
Indeed. You diffused a bomb

42:44.763 --> 42:47.864
that could have caused a war?
I did.

42:47.866 --> 42:51.701
A bomb affixed to a rocket?

42:51.703 --> 42:54.237
Yes.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.306
So a hero, again.

42:56.308 --> 42:58.675
(chuckling)

42:58.677 --> 43:01.110
He told me something
else, as well.

43:01.112 --> 43:04.314
Well, the inspector certainly
was talkative today.

43:04.316 --> 43:07.383
You rode in a balloon
and jumped out of it

43:07.385 --> 43:09.586
in some kind of suit?

43:09.588 --> 43:11.421
Mr. Pendrick assured me
that it was safe.

43:11.423 --> 43:14.290
And flew?

43:14.292 --> 43:17.527
William Henry Murdoch,

43:17.529 --> 43:20.897
if you ever do something like
that, ever again,

43:20.899 --> 43:24.200
you had better take me with you.

43:24.202 --> 43:26.703
(giggling)

43:31.442 --> 43:34.777
(theme music)

43:37.715 --> 43:40.783
