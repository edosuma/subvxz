00:34.827 --> 00:38.455
Frankie was probably the most
naturally talented performer

00:38.497 --> 00:39.748
I'd ever seen.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.750
He was...

00:41.792 --> 00:45.128
Energetic, dynamic, charismatic.

00:45.170 --> 00:48.465
He got on that stage,
and, baby, he was huge,

00:48.507 --> 00:49.758
bigger than life.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.343
See, you all got to understand.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.303
By the time I met Frankie,

00:53.345 --> 00:56.390
he was a record-deal-needing,
broke-ass,

00:56.431 --> 00:58.809
scam-on-his-mama-for-a-fix
druggie.

00:58.851 --> 01:01.228
Hell, the boy had
so many needle marks on him,

01:01.269 --> 01:03.397
I thought he was
a goddamn pincushion.

01:03.438 --> 01:06.358
Hmph. A cute pincushion,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.944
who could sing
his little ass off.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.946
Frankie was a perfect gentleman.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.448
We had a wonderful courtship.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.535
He used to bring me flowers
and write me poetry and...

01:16.577 --> 01:18.829
Nobody could do it
like Frankie Lymon.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.539
He was a junkie motherfucker.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.123
He was the love of my life.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.085
I don't know what I can
say about this next act.

01:26.127 --> 01:29.006
What can you say
but "sensational"

01:29.048 --> 01:30.507
all over the world.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.669
Hi.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.462
Elizabeth Lymon.
Elizabeth Lymon.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.506
Oh, Mrs. Lymon.

03:34.548 --> 03:38.010
Elizabeth, I'm... I'm
Peter Markowitz.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.181
Elizabeth Lymon.
Why they send you?

03:42.222 --> 03:45.308
Uh, legal referral sends
whoever's available.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.434
Please.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.855
Uh, my contact said

03:49.897 --> 03:52.649
there was a dispute
over royalties.

03:52.691 --> 03:53.901
Is that...

03:53.942 --> 03:56.444
How old are you?
You look kind of young.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.821
I'm 30.

03:57.863 --> 03:58.989
30? Damn.

03:59.031 --> 04:01.449
I swear, if you're
broke or in jail,

04:01.491 --> 04:02.910
you get the kids
just starting out

04:02.951 --> 04:05.162
on the bottom rung
out for a buck.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.706
I'm hardly bottom rung,
Mrs. Lymon,

04:07.748 --> 04:09.499
or should I say Mickey Waters,

04:09.541 --> 04:12.920
alias Elizabeth Phillips,
alias Josephine Phillips...

04:12.961 --> 04:16.255
Ok, ok, so you did your
homework. Whoop-Dee-doo.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.716
Don't have a cow, all right?

04:17.757 --> 04:20.219
What are you in for, this time?

04:20.260 --> 04:23.013
I ripped off some clothes
and shit, but look...

04:23.055 --> 04:26.266
I only got seven months left,
so let's just move on.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.060
Now, you know anything
about the record business?

04:28.102 --> 04:29.686
I know I like music.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.397
You know you like music.
Tch.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.525
Look, I was married
to Frankie Lymon.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.777
Ok.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.528
Frankie Lymon, sang
with The Teenagers,

04:38.570 --> 04:40.280
remember them?

04:40.321 --> 04:41.448
Before your time.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.200
Anyway, look, when
Frankie was alive,

04:43.242 --> 04:44.659
he wrote a lot of tunes,

04:44.701 --> 04:46.536
and one of them was called
<i>why do fools fall in love.</i>

04:46.578 --> 04:49.081
That's the song
Diana Ross has out.

04:49.123 --> 04:50.624
Diana's singing it,
but Frankie wrote it.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.292
Since he died, they've
been using that song

04:52.333 --> 04:54.002
in the film <i>American Graffiti,</i>

04:54.044 --> 04:55.212
a greeting card commercial,

04:55.254 --> 04:57.547
and now Diana's
turning it gold again.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.549
I'm his wife, so I
should get paid, right?

04:59.591 --> 05:02.177
If Frankie wrote the song,
then he must own

05:02.219 --> 05:04.345
at least part of the publishing
and its copyright,

05:04.387 --> 05:06.347
thereby making it
part of his estate,

05:06.389 --> 05:08.850
so, uh, yeah, you'd
be due those earnings.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.018
Oh, yes! All right!

05:10.060 --> 05:11.728
That's what I wanted to hear.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.022
I'm gonna get paid, sister.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.191
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.652
Mrs. Lymon,
what label was he on?

05:18.693 --> 05:19.987
Uh, roulette records.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.238
Roulette?

05:21.280 --> 05:23.364
Call the owner.
Morris Levy. All right?

05:23.406 --> 05:25.742
But if you do,
spray the receiver.

05:25.784 --> 05:26.994
The guy's so slimy,

06:15.750 --> 06:16.918
What are you doing here?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.753
We have a situation.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.922
The only situation
I'm interested in

06:20.964 --> 06:22.799
is where is my dough?
Hey, Morris.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.426
This is Lawrence Roberts.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.138
He's an attorney from LA.

06:28.180 --> 06:31.933
And this, it seems,
is Mrs. Frankie Lymon.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.897
Oh, no.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.606
Oh, miss thing knows me.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.858

06:39.900 --> 06:42.069
we seem to have one
Mrs. Lymon too many.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.197
Wait a minute. I know you ain't
came all the way up to New York

06:45.239 --> 06:47.866
in that cheap-ass
nylon wig talking shit

06:47.908 --> 06:49.576
when you know that me
and Frankie was married.

06:49.617 --> 06:50.785
Oh, please.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.080
He dropped you like
a whore's panties.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.331
Why, you bald-headed,

06:54.373 --> 06:55.957
girdle-wearing,
fake-fur-wearing bitch.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.959

ass down, bitch.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.669
I'm gonna kick your ass.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.880
Ladies, come on.
Zola. Elizabeth.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.840
Come on, it's obvious
that I've got a vested interest

07:03.882 --> 07:07.010
in this situation.
You know?

07:07.052 --> 07:08.595
So somebody please tell me...

07:08.636 --> 07:11.306
Who was married to Frankie
when he died?

07:11.348 --> 07:13.183
This is Frankie and Elizabeth's
marriage license.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.977
It's dated January 23, 1964.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.520
Screw that.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.730
It's about this.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.315
Miss girl here was married

07:20.357 --> 07:22.609
to Charles Phillips back in '59.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.945
Remember?

07:24.986 --> 07:28.407
Well, she was obviously
divorced by the time...

07:28.448 --> 07:30.700
No, I don't think so.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.328
This is a copy
of the divorce decree.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.163
Your client and Charles Phillips

07:35.205 --> 07:39.418
weren't divorced until 1965.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.753
Meanwhile, I married Frankie

07:41.795 --> 07:44.089
October 8, 1965,

07:44.131 --> 07:46.216
in Mexicali, Mexico.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.801
Plus we have a contract
with Mr. Levy

07:47.842 --> 07:50.470
stating that Zola gets 15 grand,

07:50.511 --> 07:52.639
plus 20% of future royalties

07:52.680 --> 07:55.225
as long as she proves
she's Frankie Lymon's widow.

07:55.267 --> 07:58.645
Wait. This is the same deal
you cut with Elizabeth.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.063
And tried to cut with me.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.856
I tried to stop them, sir.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.358
It's all right.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.862
Emira, this Elizabeth Waters,
Peter Markowitz,

08:07.904 --> 08:09.864
Lawrence Roberts
and Zola Taylor.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.616
Everybody, this is...

08:11.658 --> 08:13.368
Mrs. Frankie Lymon.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.535
What?!
What?!

08:14.577 --> 08:15.996
And this is my attorney,
Ezra Grahme.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.748
That's right. And we're
on our way to court

08:18.790 --> 08:21.376
to file a stay against
these proceedings,

08:21.418 --> 08:24.587
and we are suing you,
Mr. Levy,

08:24.629 --> 08:27.299
for all back royalties
you illegally collected

08:27.341 --> 08:29.717
when you put your name
on Frankie's songs.

08:29.759 --> 08:30.718
Excuse me?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.304
Frankie and I were married

08:33.347 --> 08:36.308
June 30, 1967,
in Augusta, Georgia.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.601
We were still married
when Frankie died.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.602
I paid for his funeral,

08:40.645 --> 08:42.647
and I don't recall
seeing any of you there.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.649
Oh, please, don't even play me,

08:44.691 --> 08:47.068
not coming in here wearing
white after labor day

08:47.110 --> 08:49.654
looking like some old
down-home schoolmarm.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.991
Yes, I am a down-home
schoolmarm.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.493
I teach high school English,

08:54.534 --> 08:56.495
a class you obviously skipped.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.955
Oh, no, she didn't.
No, she didn't!

08:58.997 --> 09:00.790
It's bad enough I've got
to deal with this bitch,

09:00.832 --> 09:03.210
let alone now
your country-apple ass!

09:03.251 --> 09:04.878
Who you calling a bitch?!

09:06.213 --> 09:08.006
Should I call the cops?!

09:08.048 --> 09:10.008
Yeah, baby, you call the police

09:10.050 --> 09:11.676
and tell them we got
two impostors up here

09:11.718 --> 09:14.429
running a scam, because
I'm Mrs. Frankie Lymon.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.014
I'm Mrs. Frankie Lymon!

09:16.056 --> 09:17.724
I am
Mrs. Frankie Lymon.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.851
Jesus Christ,
it's a goddamn game show.

09:19.893 --> 09:20.852
She lying.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.187
You lied to me.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.563
What do you mean, I'm lying?

09:23.604 --> 09:24.731
I buried Frankie.

09:24.772 --> 09:28.068
All Mrs. Lymons
shut up, damn it!

09:28.109 --> 09:30.111
Don't you tell me to shut up!

09:30.153 --> 09:34.199
Who the hell
are you telling to shut up?

09:34.241 --> 09:35.909
Hear ye, hear ye,
surrogate court

09:35.950 --> 09:37.911
of the state of New York
is now in session.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.162
All rise.

09:39.204 --> 09:42.123
The honorable
Sarah d'Angelo presiding.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.042
Draw ye near
and ye shall be heard.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.877
Please sit.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.755
This proceeding is
for letters of administration

09:48.796 --> 09:51.550
for the estate of frank
Joseph Lymon deceased.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.551
Is that correct?

09:52.592 --> 09:53.634
Yes, your honor.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.095
Yes, ma'am.

09:55.136 --> 09:58.765
And am I to understand
that there are three women here

09:58.806 --> 10:01.768
claiming to be the alleged
widow of the decedent?

10:01.809 --> 10:03.103
Yes, your honor.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.604
Yes, your honor.

10:04.645 --> 10:08.983
Ok. Mr. Roberts, present
your first witness, please.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.485
I'd like to call
Mr. Richard Barrett

10:10.527 --> 10:11.903
to the stand, your honor.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.905
My name is Richard Barrett.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.576
For 32 years, I've managed
and produced entertainers.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.035
And during those 32 years,
Mr. Barrett,

10:19.077 --> 10:21.329
did you have the occasion
to manage Frankie Lymon?

10:21.371 --> 10:23.248
I managed and produced Frankie.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.000
Mm-hmm. And when was
that Mr. Barrett?

10:26.042 --> 10:28.628
1955.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.590
You see, in 1955,
he and his group

10:31.631 --> 10:33.258
used to sing outside my window.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.302
♪ Do fools ♪

10:35.343 --> 10:39.973
♪ Fall in love ♪

10:40.014 --> 10:42.100
Hey, Mr. Barrett,
give us a record deal!

10:42.142 --> 10:43.435
Come on!

10:43.477 --> 10:45.270
Who wrote that song?
We did.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.313
I'll be right down.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.106
I knew Morris Levy

10:48.148 --> 10:50.275
and George Goldner, his partner,

10:50.317 --> 10:52.652
and they were looking
for Latin groups to record.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.613
Now, Herman Santiago,

10:54.654 --> 10:57.365
the lead singer at the time,
is Puerto Rican.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.619
I sold Morris on The Teenagers

11:00.660 --> 11:03.037
by telling him
they were a Latin group.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.124
On the day of the audition,

11:06.166 --> 11:08.460
things didn't go exactly
the way I'd planned.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.919
I called him three times.

11:09.961 --> 11:10.920
Call his house!

11:10.962 --> 11:12.547
I'll call him.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.881
Sherman, is it ringing?

11:13.923 --> 11:15.550
Please be there.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.760
Hey. Here he is.
Here he is.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.095
Herman.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.347
Mr. Barrett,
he's sick.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.265
What are we supposed
to do, postpone?

11:22.307 --> 11:23.766
No, it's ok. We don't
postpone. We go on.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.519
We go on, we do it.
I got here, all right?

11:25.560 --> 11:26.520
Wait a minute.

11:26.561 --> 11:27.686
I wrote the song with Herman,

11:27.728 --> 11:28.896
and I know the high part.

11:28.938 --> 11:29.897
I could sing it.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.191
Yeah, he could do it.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.317
Don't bullshit me.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.901
I can do it. I can.
I promise.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.487
Very good.
I'll get back to you guys.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.155
Hey! How you doing?

11:37.197 --> 11:38.323
Pretty good, yeah.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.408
These are the guys
I told you about.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.993
How you doing,
Mr. Morris?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.578
These guys look
pretty un-Spanish.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.121
Just listen to them, all right?

11:45.163 --> 11:46.122

Ha ha...

12:54.982 --> 12:56.276
They couldn't resist him.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.278
And was Zola Taylor
one of those women?

12:58.319 --> 13:00.488
Oh, yeah.
Zola was one of them.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.616
Mm-hmm. And did you
know about a marriage

13:02.657 --> 13:04.242

13:15.712 --> 13:17.171
I'm the man that started it all,

13:17.213 --> 13:18.715
and before me was nothing.

13:18.757 --> 13:21.384
I've been abused. I've been
misused. I ain't no fool.

23:30.284 --> 23:33.204
I mean, he's sort of...

23:33.246 --> 23:36.498
Well, he's kind of a bum, too.

23:36.540 --> 23:40.502
Come on. Let's get
something to eat.

23:40.544 --> 23:41.754

23:41.795 --> 23:44.048
Uh, he left us eight months ago.

23:44.090 --> 23:47.843
I don't know.
It must've got to him

23:47.885 --> 23:49.762
I was the one
making enough money

23:49.803 --> 23:53.557
to pay for all the bills,
and he wasn't.

23:53.599 --> 23:56.518
You know, he's the one
who started me singing.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.020
Really?
Yeah.

23:58.062 --> 23:59.897
He had a gospel group
when I was a kid,

23:59.939 --> 24:01.982
and me and my brothers
used to sing with him.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.944
We used to have a lot of fun.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.571
It don't matter now.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.989
He was a drunk.

24:09.031 --> 24:11.409
Anytime I turned around,
he was beating on us.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.913
When you're ready.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.540
Uh, let me take care of this.

Number three.

No, no. You better let me
take care of this,

<i>Out in the cold again.</i>

25:44.542 --> 25:47.587
And on the other side,
<i>miracle in the rain.</i>

25:47.629 --> 25:50.341
That's Frankie Lymon.
There's no Teenagers.

25:50.383 --> 25:53.386
There's no group.
There's no nothing.

25:53.427 --> 25:57.515
This solo shit has been planned
from the gate, wasn't it?

25:57.555 --> 25:59.099
You knew all along.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.101
We were a family!
We came up together!

26:01.143 --> 26:04.271
I swear, it wasn't my decision.

26:04.313 --> 26:08.650
You want to walk? Fine.
But family doesn't do that.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.777
Family ain't bound by contracts.

26:10.819 --> 26:11.904
That's low.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.571
We're still family.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.657
No, Frankie.

26:15.699 --> 26:16.992
Thanks a lot, Frankie.

26:17.034 --> 26:19.078
Frankie, he's crazy.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.538
You want a drink?

26:20.578 --> 26:22.248
I don't want a drink.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.418
Just leave me alone.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.237
Frankie?

26:53.279 --> 26:54.821
What are you doing?

26:56.990 --> 26:58.492
Herman was right.

26:58.534 --> 27:03.205
I... knew they wanted me
to go solo two months ago.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.707
But the way Morris handled it...

27:05.749 --> 27:07.667
So chickenshit.

27:09.753 --> 27:14.425
Well, he's
a chickenshit guy, Frankie.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.427
I thought he'd at least

27:16.469 --> 27:19.012
keep The Teenagers
together, you know?

27:19.054 --> 27:20.389
Yeah.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.478
Those are my friends, Zola.

27:25.519 --> 27:28.272
We grew up together.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.608
We did everything together.

27:30.648 --> 27:32.067
We're like family.

27:32.109 --> 27:34.778
More family than my own,
and this...

27:34.820 --> 27:36.405
This is how I treat them.

27:36.447 --> 27:38.407
Really, I understand.

27:38.449 --> 27:39.408
No. You...

27:39.450 --> 27:42.119
I do. Really.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.122
Why don't you and I
go for a walk?

27:45.164 --> 27:47.958
We can maybe get a drink.
We can talk.

27:49.751 --> 27:52.838
It'll make you
feel better. Hmm?

27:52.879 --> 27:53.880
Come on.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.841
Now, sooner or later, Frankie,

27:55.882 --> 27:58.177
you are going to have
to realize, ok,

27:58.218 --> 28:00.887
that it's <i>you</i>
people come to see.

28:00.929 --> 28:04.099
<i>You</i> and that fabulous
voice <i>you</i> have.

28:04.141 --> 28:07.269
Come on. Here's to
Frankie's voice.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.940
Ahh, man.

28:11.982 --> 28:15.277
You know, sometimes my voice,

28:15.319 --> 28:17.571
me being on stage, it's like...

28:17.613 --> 28:19.239
It's like all I got going.

28:19.281 --> 28:22.660
When I'm out there, I'm not just
some colored kid from Harlem

28:22.700 --> 28:24.870
or some guy record execs
are fighting over.

28:24.911 --> 28:27.789
You know, man, I'm just me,

28:27.831 --> 28:30.334
and that audience... ha ha!

28:30.376 --> 28:33.003
I feel alive. I feel free,
and I love it!

28:33.045 --> 28:35.755
First time I heard you sing,
I was standing in the back,

28:35.797 --> 28:39.259
I saw you and said,
"this guy is so special.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.512
He has got to be
touched by god."

28:42.929 --> 28:44.390
What you have, Frankie,

28:44.431 --> 28:47.893
it's so... Amazing.

28:47.934 --> 28:50.354
I can't even...

28:50.396 --> 28:53.273
It's what?

28:53.315 --> 28:54.274
I... I...

28:54.316 --> 28:56.569
Frankie, you know,

28:56.610 --> 28:58.571
I think it was a mistake

28:58.612 --> 29:01.781
that I asked you
to come up here.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.867
Maybe the mistake was...

29:03.909 --> 29:06.245
Not asking me sooner.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.881
Baby...

29:17.923 --> 29:20.426
Frankie, hold... hold on.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.678
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.846
What...

29:24.888 --> 29:28.684
Frankie, what are you doing?

29:28.726 --> 29:31.645
Wait. Frankie,
what are you doing?

29:31.687 --> 29:34.064
Wait. Frankie, wait.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.065
What?

29:35.107 --> 29:36.609
You're gonna rip my dress.

29:36.650 --> 29:37.776
Oh, I...

29:37.817 --> 29:39.278
It's over here.

29:39.319 --> 29:42.197
Right. Right.

29:42.239 --> 29:44.700
Do it like that.

29:44.742 --> 29:47.202
Oh, man. Mmm!

29:47.244 --> 29:50.038
Ha! Wait.
Frankie, wait!

29:50.080 --> 29:52.916
Frankie. No.

29:55.419 --> 29:57.379
Oh. Right.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.423
It hooks in the back.

30:03.594 --> 30:05.345
Thank you, god.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.952
Frankie told me
what happened the next day.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.705
But I wasn't no fool.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.707
Even ray Charles could see

30:33.749 --> 30:37.336
the two of them was like
white on rice after that.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.505
You know what I mean.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.507
Thank you, Mr. Penniman.

30:41.548 --> 30:42.716
No further questions,
your honor.

30:42.758 --> 30:45.511
Fine. Then this witness
is dismissed.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.095
Groovy!

30:47.137 --> 30:49.682
State your name and address
for the records, please.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.433
Elizabeth Waters Lymon,

30:51.475 --> 30:54.520
3639 south 22nd street,
Philadelphia.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.691
Elizabeth,

30:58.732 --> 31:01.610
when did you first
meet Frankie Lymon?

31:01.652 --> 31:03.362
In 1961.

31:03.403 --> 31:06.072
See, my first husband
had split on me and our baby,

31:06.114 --> 31:08.701
so I left Yolanda
with my mama in Philly,

31:08.742 --> 31:11.411
and I came to New York
looking for work.

31:11.453 --> 31:15.248
Well, one day I was out shopping
and I ran into Frankie.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.168
I didn't know that
he was Frankie Lymon.

31:26.051 --> 31:28.428
Yes. I'd like to see
this perfume here, please.

31:28.470 --> 31:29.555
Of course.
Just a moment.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.014
Thank you.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.440
Excuse me, miss.

31:40.482 --> 31:42.192
I need you to empty
your pockets for me.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.318
Excuse me?

31:43.360 --> 31:45.362
I've been looking
all over for you.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.988
Did you find the perfume
you've been looking for?

31:47.030 --> 31:48.281
Are you two together?

31:48.323 --> 31:51.117
Yes. This is the perfume
that mama loves.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.870
Let's not forget
the bracelet for my mother.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.705
The rest of our things
are at the counter.

31:54.747 --> 31:55.831
Let's pay for it.

31:55.873 --> 31:56.998
I'm watching you.

31:57.040 --> 31:57.999
What the hell are you doing?

31:58.041 --> 31:59.251
You should thank me, doll.

31:59.292 --> 32:00.502
For what?
I ain't done nothin'.

32:00.544 --> 32:04.590
Then what is all this?
Damn, baby.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.258
You got a nursing school?
What's this?

32:06.299 --> 32:08.385
What's your angle, huh?

32:08.427 --> 32:10.512
Hey, I don't want to see
a cute thing like you

32:10.554 --> 32:14.683
wind up in the 43rd.
It's a shithole.

32:14.725 --> 32:15.893
Hmm.

32:17.477 --> 32:18.937
Hey, what kind of a dog is that?

32:18.978 --> 32:20.355
A somma dog.

32:20.397 --> 32:21.857
A somma dog?

32:21.899 --> 32:23.983
Yeah. Somma this,
somma that.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.652
Ha ha ha! I like it.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.738
He's cute. Yeah.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.698
So you got a daughter
or something?

32:29.740 --> 32:31.700
Yeah. I got
a little girl.

32:31.742 --> 32:32.701
Yeah?

32:32.743 --> 32:33.993
Her name is Yolanda.

32:34.035 --> 32:34.994
Wow.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.496
She's eight months.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.290
Bet she's beautiful,
just like her mama.

32:38.331 --> 32:41.293
So tell me, is her
daddy still around?

32:41.334 --> 32:42.961
He told me he was a singer

32:43.002 --> 32:44.463
and gave me two tickets
to his show that night.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.381
I never been to this club.
I hear it's nice.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.383
Mickey, who is he?

32:48.425 --> 32:50.218
I don't know,
but he sure is cute.

32:50.260 --> 32:51.219
He's cute!

32:53.054 --> 32:54.723
But before I go,
I just want to say

32:54.765 --> 32:57.058
if I've offended
anyone here tonight

32:57.100 --> 32:58.727
or upset you
by anything I've said,

32:58.769 --> 33:00.562
let me address that with this...

33:00.604 --> 33:01.772
Kiss my ass.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.240
Funny man. One more time.
Redd Foxx, y'all.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.871
And now coming to the stage,
one of the all-time greats,

33:17.913 --> 33:19.748
put your hands together,
ladies and gentlemen,

33:19.790 --> 33:21.082

35:06.021 --> 35:07.522
All right.
Your honor.

35:07.564 --> 35:09.608
You making him out
like a whore like you.

35:09.649 --> 35:10.817
You shut up!
You shut up!

35:10.859 --> 35:12.611
I'm the one telling
the story, Missy.

35:12.652 --> 35:14.821
It's an a and b conversation.

35:14.863 --> 35:15.948
Frankie was classy.

35:15.989 --> 35:17.657
Miss Taylor, quiet!

35:17.699 --> 35:19.284
That doesn't sound
like my Frankie.

35:19.325 --> 35:21.703
Sit down, miss Taylor, please.

35:21.745 --> 35:23.496
Sit down.
Sit down.

35:26.666 --> 35:29.753
All right.

Come on.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.361
Whoo!
Ha ha ha!

35:55.403 --> 35:57.656
Whoo!

35:57.697 --> 35:59.032
Better get a towel.

35:59.074 --> 36:00.742
This is it.
Come on in here.

36:00.784 --> 36:03.120
Make yourself at home.
Have a seat.

36:08.374 --> 36:10.543
You know...

36:10.585 --> 36:12.754
This is normally not this messy.

36:12.796 --> 36:14.756
I stay so busy, I'm always gone,

36:14.798 --> 36:17.550
I haven't had time
to clean up the place.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.052
I thought with you being
a star and everything...

36:19.094 --> 36:21.054
You thought because I'm a singer

36:21.096 --> 36:24.474
I should have maids
and servants.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.559
Well, I don't.

36:26.601 --> 36:27.727
Sure don't.

36:29.354 --> 36:32.315
In fact, this ain't
even my place.

36:32.357 --> 36:35.234
I share it with a roommate
who's always gone.

36:35.276 --> 36:38.071
That's cool.
I'm not judging you.

36:38.113 --> 36:42.159
I think it's fine.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.077
You fine, too.

36:44.119 --> 36:46.454
Thank you.

36:46.496 --> 36:48.581
You can sing, too.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.500
Thank you again.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.919
That's Zola Taylor, huh?

36:52.961 --> 36:55.839
Yeah. She's
a good friend.

36:55.881 --> 36:58.341
Mmm. She's pretty.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.679
So, you goin' out with her?

37:02.721 --> 37:06.808
Oh, no.
See, that's old news.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.935
Mm-hmm.

37:08.977 --> 37:11.897
I just don't understand.
Why me? I'm a nobody.

37:11.938 --> 37:16.735
I'm not some big star
like miss Zola.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.778
I'm just Mickey.

37:18.820 --> 37:22.574
Maybe it's because
you're not some big star.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.283
Maybe it's because you
thought I was a nice guy

37:24.325 --> 37:26.995
before... before
you knew who I was.

37:27.037 --> 37:29.873
I still think you're nice.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.835
I think you're nice, too.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.609
Mmm. Come on.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.861
What's that?

38:51.830 --> 38:53.206
We moved in together.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.707
I know, girl.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.876
Said five minutes.
I been here five hours.

38:56.918 --> 38:58.253
Ok. Right here
by the wall.

38:58.295 --> 38:59.712
I ain't doin' this all day now.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.339
Right there.

39:01.380 --> 39:03.091
Wastin' my Saturday.

39:03.133 --> 39:04.843
Girl, I'm a little woman.

39:04.884 --> 39:06.678
I'll catch a hernia
messing with you.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.680
Girl, I'm sorry
I had you dragging

39:08.721 --> 39:10.389
this heavy thing up
here with me.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.558
I should have got
one of the fellas.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.060
It's all right.

39:14.102 --> 39:17.396
I love dragging that bad boy
up four flights of stairs

39:17.438 --> 39:20.525
just so you and your
broke-ass junkie boyfriend

39:20.566 --> 39:23.528
can be comfy-cozy.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.864
How you gonna talk
about my man like that?

39:25.905 --> 39:27.699
Come on now, Mickey.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.951
The boy got a $10-a-day habit.

39:29.993 --> 39:32.037
Where you hear that lie from?

39:32.078 --> 39:34.789
Who do you think
you're talking to?

39:34.831 --> 39:37.750
He's taking you for a ride.
Seen it happen every day.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.878
I'm from the streets.
I know what it look like.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.713
When's the last time
he had a record?

39:41.754 --> 39:43.131
He's been trying.

39:43.173 --> 39:44.924
I got a record player.
I ain't heard no records.

39:44.966 --> 39:47.177
You're too hard on him.

39:47.219 --> 39:51.514
♪ No, no,
no, no, no, no, no ♪

39:51.556 --> 39:53.516
Well, it was true.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.518
Frankie hadn't recorded
in years,

39:55.560 --> 39:57.896
and by '61, music had moved on,

39:57.937 --> 40:01.900
and Frankie's career,
it was on the downslide.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.318
How you doin'?

40:05.237 --> 40:06.738
Make sure you get
a good book, all right?

40:06.779 --> 40:08.240
Will do.

40:08.281 --> 40:09.949
Hey, Mrs. Johnson.
Tell Vernon to come see me.

40:09.991 --> 40:10.950
I will.

40:10.992 --> 40:13.245
Ahh, Mickey, sweet Mickey.

40:14.871 --> 40:17.665
Easy for us.
Up we go!

40:17.707 --> 40:20.252
Gol-ly.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.212
Now, how come you
can't do that, huh?

40:24.964 --> 40:25.924
Aww...

40:25.965 --> 40:27.259
Teach him.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.928
Hey, Frankie.

40:29.969 --> 40:32.138
Aw, baby,
it's looking good in here.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.599
Well, I still got
to paint and stuff,

40:34.640 --> 40:35.975
but it's coming along.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.061
Hey, I got something
for you, sunshine.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.897
For me?
Oh, that's so sweet.

40:40.939 --> 40:44.817
Oh, my god!

40:44.859 --> 40:47.404
Frankie, god, is it mink?

40:47.445 --> 40:49.447
Of course, it's mink.
Try it on.

40:49.488 --> 40:51.783
Help me.

40:51.824 --> 40:53.285
Wow.

40:53.326 --> 40:56.246
Nobody ever done nothing
like this for me before.

40:56.288 --> 40:58.248
I love it.

40:58.290 --> 41:00.375
I love you.

41:00.417 --> 41:03.253
Frankie told me
he was gonna give me everything.

41:03.295 --> 41:04.545
Strut your stuff.

41:04.587 --> 41:08.091
And he did.
He was so good to me.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.135
I was happier
than I had ever been.

41:10.176 --> 41:12.971
When I was with him,
he made me feel like a star.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.973
Yes! Told you
I was gonna show you things,

41:15.014 --> 41:16.515
now come on, woman!

41:16.557 --> 41:19.685
But then reality hit...

41:19.727 --> 41:21.938
Big time.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.773
Frankie's drug thing...

41:23.815 --> 41:25.775
Well, it forced me to find

41:25.817 --> 41:29.028
new and interesting
places to hide cash.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.490
Hey, Frankie.

41:32.531 --> 41:34.659
You talk to Morris
about an advance?

41:34.700 --> 41:36.244
What did he say?
Yeah.

41:36.286 --> 41:38.371
What you think?
He told me to beat it.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.873
Forget him, Frankie.
Find yourself a new label.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.460
Don't let folks
control your fate.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.129
You know, I saw on
<i>what's my line?</i>

41:46.171 --> 41:48.881
Where this guy Nietzche said,

41:48.923 --> 41:51.759
"I am the master of my fate,

41:51.801 --> 41:53.136
the captain of my soul."

41:53.178 --> 41:54.512
Do you know what that means?

41:54.553 --> 41:57.015
I don't want to hear
no bullshit about Nickiski

41:57.056 --> 41:58.516
or whoever the fuck he is.

41:58.557 --> 42:00.310
I need a gig, man!

42:00.352 --> 42:02.437
Fine. I was just trying to
say some kind words to you.

42:02.479 --> 42:05.315
Stay at roulette
and stay broke, then.

42:05.357 --> 42:06.607
Can't say nothing to you.

42:06.649 --> 42:08.985
You're always lecturing me.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.403
Damn!

42:12.405 --> 42:14.240
Look, um, I need some money.

42:14.282 --> 42:16.326
No! The rent is due
tomorrow.

42:16.368 --> 42:18.744
I'm gonna give it back
to you on time. Damn!

42:18.786 --> 42:20.746
You said that shit last month.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.040
That's why we
ain't got no phone.

42:22.081 --> 42:23.541
Don't embarrass me.

42:23.582 --> 42:25.918
I got this landlord asking
for the rent tomorrow.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.921
Frankie, what are you doing?

42:30.340 --> 42:31.632
Where the money
I gave you to hold?

42:31.674 --> 42:33.551
You ain't gave me
no money, Frankie.

42:33.592 --> 42:34.552
You hid it.

42:34.593 --> 42:36.262
No, I didn't.

42:36.304 --> 42:38.556
Frankie, this shit
has got you acting crazy.

42:38.597 --> 42:41.017
You want me to look
through stuff?

42:41.059 --> 42:42.519
Frankie, what are you doing?

42:42.560 --> 42:44.896
Want me to look for the money?

42:44.937 --> 42:46.272
Where the fuck is my money?

42:46.314 --> 42:47.899
Stop that, Frankie!

42:47.940 --> 42:50.527
That shit got you acting
like you're crazy!

42:50.568 --> 42:52.611
You fucking crazy!
Where the money at?

42:52.653 --> 42:54.531
What is wrong with you?

42:54.572 --> 42:55.948
You're what's wrong with me!

42:55.990 --> 42:57.450
You're why I can't get
off the fucking dime!

42:57.492 --> 42:58.951
Always lecturing me!

Frankie.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.575
I'll get a new one.

45:43.616 --> 45:45.117
That was your gift, baby.

45:45.159 --> 45:46.327
I'll get another one.

45:46.369 --> 45:47.786
Shouldn't have gave it to them.

45:47.828 --> 45:48.829
Shh.

45:48.871 --> 45:50.789
Shouldn't have gave it to them.

45:50.831 --> 45:52.083
It's ok.

45:52.124 --> 45:54.544
Because I gave Coop that money,

45:54.586 --> 45:57.171
we couldn't pay our rent
and we got evicted,

45:57.213 --> 45:59.674
so we had to move in
with my mama in Philly.

Boy, they were hard times.

46:14.606 --> 46:16.566
Frankie was hardly ever working,

46:16.608 --> 46:18.943
and we never had no money.

46:18.984 --> 46:21.446
He was struggling
with his drug thing.

46:21.487 --> 46:23.906
He really tried to quit.

46:23.948 --> 46:26.367
And I still believed in him.

46:26.409 --> 46:29.412
One time we drove down
to Virginia for a gig.

46:35.752 --> 46:37.086
What are we doing here?

46:37.128 --> 46:38.421
Come on.

46:38.463 --> 46:41.257
Say, we want to get married.

46:41.299 --> 46:44.260
Married?

46:44.302 --> 46:45.511
We do?

46:45.553 --> 46:47.513
Did you change your mind?

46:47.555 --> 46:48.598
No! No!

46:48.640 --> 46:51.267
Of course I want to marry you.

46:51.309 --> 46:55.271
Baby, I told you.
I'm gonna give you everything.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.315
I promise.

47:02.403 --> 47:04.447
Let's get to it.
Ok.

47:06.991 --> 47:08.451
I'm a little nervous.

47:09.786 --> 47:11.746
S-sign here.

47:11.788 --> 47:13.456
Right here? Ok.

47:13.498 --> 47:15.249
Elizabeth,
I'd like you to take a look

47:15.291 --> 47:19.170
at this document. Do you
recognize the signatures?

47:19.211 --> 47:21.046
Yes. They're
Frankie's and mine.

47:21.088 --> 47:24.049
And can you tell me what it says

47:24.091 --> 47:26.969
next to the words
"status of applicant"?

47:27.011 --> 47:28.095
"Single."

47:28.137 --> 47:31.848
I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear that.

47:31.890 --> 47:34.226
It says, "single."

47:34.268 --> 47:36.228
Could you explain to the court

47:36.270 --> 47:37.980
why you wrote the word "single"?

47:38.022 --> 47:40.692
Actually, Frankie
filled in that part.

47:40.733 --> 47:43.778
I guess he didn't want
any confusion to stop us.

47:43.820 --> 47:46.614
So you admit there was confusion

47:46.656 --> 47:48.616
because you were still married

47:48.658 --> 47:50.743
to your first husband.

47:50.785 --> 47:52.203
You lied on your application.

47:52.244 --> 47:54.831
Not intentionally.

47:54.871 --> 47:56.833
I didn't know
I was still married.

47:56.873 --> 47:58.793
This lawyer told me
I was free to marry again.

47:58.835 --> 48:00.795
Isn't it true you'd
have done anything

48:00.837 --> 48:02.505

53:38.507 --> 53:39.842
You don't care about me!

53:39.884 --> 53:42.302
All you care about is
this stupid fucking dog!

53:42.344 --> 53:43.804
Look at your ass.

53:43.846 --> 53:45.597
Please don't play with the dog.

53:45.639 --> 53:48.642
Look at your ass.
"Frankie, please."

53:48.684 --> 53:50.644
What the fuck you want, Ming?

53:50.686 --> 53:52.396
I'll throw this motherfucker!

53:52.437 --> 53:54.356
I'll throw this... ha ha!

53:54.398 --> 53:57.026
I ain't gonna
do nothing. Get up.

53:57.068 --> 53:58.402
Ow!

53:58.443 --> 54:01.488
Shit!
The motherfucker bit me!

54:01.530 --> 54:03.532
Oh, shit!
I'm sorry, baby!

54:03.574 --> 54:07.036
Frankie, you killed my baby!

54:07.078 --> 54:09.371
He bit me! He bit me!

54:09.413 --> 54:12.374
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

54:13.918 --> 54:15.377
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

54:15.419 --> 54:17.253
You killed my baby!

54:17.295 --> 54:19.423
I didn't mean to do it.

54:19.464 --> 54:20.925
Get off of me!

54:20.966 --> 54:22.467
I didn't mean to do it.
She bit me!

54:22.509 --> 54:24.887
Get off of me!
Get out of here!

54:24.929 --> 54:25.888
Baby!

54:25.930 --> 54:27.890
Get out of here.

54:27.932 --> 54:28.974
I'm sorry.

54:29.016 --> 54:31.476
Get off of me!
Get out, Frankie!

54:31.518 --> 54:35.231
You gotta go!
I can't take no more.

54:35.271 --> 54:36.440
I'm sorry.

54:36.481 --> 54:38.776
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

54:38.817 --> 54:40.402
Just go. Go!

54:42.446 --> 54:44.990
I didn't mean it, baby.

54:45.032 --> 54:47.785
I didn't mean it.

54:58.712 --> 55:02.298
Your honor, may I request
a short recess, please?

55:04.635 --> 55:06.470
Yes. We'll take
a 10-minute recess.

55:06.511 --> 55:07.471
Ok.

55:08.806 --> 55:09.807
Thank you.

55:15.980 --> 55:18.565
Elizabeth...

55:18.607 --> 55:21.777
Did you ever see Frankie again

55:21.819 --> 55:23.946
after the unfortunate
incident with the dog?

55:23.988 --> 55:28.408
Yeah. Later,
in 1965 in LA.

55:28.450 --> 55:30.828
Did Frankie mention
he married Zola Taylor?

55:30.869 --> 55:33.998
He ain't married no Zola.
He was still married to me.

55:34.039 --> 55:35.666
In fact, he wrote me in Philly

55:35.707 --> 55:37.251
telling me things weren't
working out with her.

55:37.293 --> 55:38.502
He didn't tell you shit.

55:38.543 --> 55:40.921
And begged me
to come and see him.

55:40.963 --> 55:42.380
And I went to see him.

55:42.422 --> 55:45.467
But I didn't know
we were staying at Zola's house.

55:45.509 --> 55:47.385
I'm glad you came out to see me.

55:47.427 --> 55:50.139
I was... I was missing you, baby.

55:50.181 --> 55:51.640
I want you to know,

55:51.682 --> 55:53.475
I'm really sorry about
the way things turned out.

55:53.517 --> 55:55.477
They say the best way
to put the past behind you

55:55.519 --> 55:56.937
is start all over.

55:56.979 --> 55:58.438
Start over?

56:03.443 --> 56:06.613
What the fuck is going on?

56:06.655 --> 56:07.614
Zola!

56:07.656 --> 56:09.700
Put your clothes on.

56:09.741 --> 56:11.660
Hey, Z.
This is my friend...

56:11.702 --> 56:14.330
I don't give a shit
who the fuck she is.

56:14.370 --> 56:16.207
What the hell is she
doing in my pool?

56:16.248 --> 56:18.416
He invited me for the night.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

56:18.458 --> 56:19.960
For the night?

56:20.002 --> 56:22.504
You're getting your shit and
getting the fuck out now!

56:22.546 --> 56:24.923
She's leaving.

56:24.965 --> 56:26.758
Wait! Are those
my clothes?!

56:26.800 --> 56:28.177
Are you putting on my shit?

56:28.219 --> 56:29.678
Are you crazy?

56:29.720 --> 56:32.848
Out there with my man
in my pool in my shit?

56:32.890 --> 56:34.099
I'm going to kill her!

56:34.141 --> 56:36.185
Wait! Hold on!

56:36.227 --> 56:38.187
Frankie, you up here
with that bitch

56:38.229 --> 56:39.897
that brought you
down in New York?

56:39.938 --> 56:41.148
Who you calling bitch?

56:41.190 --> 56:43.025
I'm gonna put my foot
so far up your ass

56:43.067 --> 56:44.360
that you will be
sprouting shoelaces!

56:44.400 --> 56:47.029
Damn! Frankie!

56:47.071 --> 56:49.573
Oh! Oh! Oh!

56:49.614 --> 56:51.700
No, wait!

56:51.742 --> 56:53.785
Get her out!

56:53.827 --> 56:56.872
Get me? Goddamn it!

56:56.914 --> 56:58.207
That is a lie, your honor!

56:58.249 --> 56:59.666
You know it didn't
go down like that!

56:59.708 --> 57:01.585
Miss Taylor.

57:01.626 --> 57:03.295
Lie after lie after lie.
Do something.

57:03.337 --> 57:04.880
Will you chill?

57:04.922 --> 57:06.798
You're supposed
to be a class act.

57:06.840 --> 57:07.799
I am a class act.

57:07.841 --> 57:09.801
Then act like one.

57:09.843 --> 57:11.720
It's after 4:00.

57:11.762 --> 57:15.431
I suggest we end today's session
and resume tomorrow at 9:00.

57:15.473 --> 57:18.143
We are adjourned.

57:18.185 --> 57:19.603
Your honor, I'd like to call

57:19.644 --> 57:21.939
Zola Taylor to the stand.

57:21.980 --> 57:22.940
Do you solemnly swear

57:22.981 --> 57:24.024
the testimony
you're about to give

57:24.066 --> 57:25.192
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

57:25.234 --> 57:26.318
and nothing but the truth,
so help you god?

57:26.360 --> 57:30.322
Yes, the <i>real</i> truth.

57:30.364 --> 57:31.448
Miss Taylor,

57:31.489 --> 57:33.158
can you tell me how long

57:33.200 --> 57:35.327
you and Frankie Lymon
were involved?

57:35.369 --> 57:37.329
On and off for 10 years.

57:37.371 --> 57:39.164
What happened in 1962?

57:39.206 --> 57:41.166
I had to tour Europe
with The Platters,

57:41.208 --> 57:44.669
and Frankie's play dates
started to dwindle.

57:44.711 --> 57:48.173
And I believe
that was the time when...

57:48.215 --> 57:49.549
He started using.

57:49.591 --> 57:50.968
Heroin?

57:51.009 --> 57:52.677
Yes.

57:52.719 --> 57:55.680
When Frankie
couldn't get that high

57:55.722 --> 57:58.183
from being on stage...

57:58.225 --> 57:59.851
I think he...

57:59.893 --> 58:01.686
Tried to find it elsewhere.

58:01.728 --> 58:04.189
You see, Frankie's career
was never the same

58:04.231 --> 58:06.566
after he split
from The Teenagers.

58:06.608 --> 58:08.693
I was on tour,
traveling with The Platters,

58:08.735 --> 58:11.196
and I saw Frankie less and less.

58:11.238 --> 58:13.198
I still had my place
in New York, though.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.242
Frankie still had the key.

58:17.494 --> 58:18.536
Zola!

58:19.579 --> 58:22.207
Ha ha! Hey, Z!

58:22.249 --> 58:23.708
Zola Taylor, you tried
to sneak in town

58:23.750 --> 58:25.710
and didn't tell nobody.

58:25.752 --> 58:26.711
Come here.

58:26.753 --> 58:28.797
Mmm!

58:28.839 --> 58:29.923
It was obvious

58:29.965 --> 58:32.550
that he had been
doing some drugs.

58:32.592 --> 58:33.677
Strung out.

58:33.718 --> 58:35.220
My mink stole, Frankie.

58:35.262 --> 58:36.388
Where is it?

58:36.430 --> 58:38.390
You askin' the wrong person.

58:38.432 --> 58:39.891
I don't... mink?
I do...

58:39.933 --> 58:40.934
Frankie.

58:40.976 --> 58:42.227
I thought you took it.

58:42.269 --> 58:44.229
Look, Frankie,
I only came back here

58:44.271 --> 58:46.231
to do this <i>Ed Sullivan show.</i>

58:46.273 --> 58:48.066
And then I'm packing up
all my stuff,

58:48.108 --> 58:49.234
as you can see,

58:49.276 --> 58:50.735
and I'm going back
to LA.

58:50.777 --> 58:52.612
For good this time.

58:52.654 --> 58:53.822
For good?

58:56.992 --> 58:59.995
While I was on tour
this last time, Frankie,

59:00.037 --> 59:02.039
I, uh...

59:03.957 --> 59:05.501
I got married.

59:05.542 --> 59:09.004
I... I know it's all
kinda sudden for you,

59:09.046 --> 59:11.340
but you know,
he lives out in LA.

59:11.382 --> 59:13.008
He used to be a drummer,

59:13.050 --> 59:14.510
but now he's a carpenter.

59:14.551 --> 59:16.845
Out of the blue?
Just like that?

59:16.887 --> 59:19.806
He's a really nice man.
He's stable.

59:19.848 --> 59:21.099
Do you love him?

59:21.141 --> 59:23.519
I told you, Frankie,
he's a nice, good man.

59:23.560 --> 59:24.853
I didn't ask that!

59:24.895 --> 59:26.313
I asked you, do you love him?

59:26.355 --> 59:27.523
Yes!

59:27.564 --> 59:29.191
I love him, ok?

59:29.233 --> 59:31.026
No, no.
That's bullshit.

59:31.068 --> 59:33.111
You said marriage
would tie you down.

59:33.153 --> 59:34.988
You just didn't want
to be tied down to me.

59:35.030 --> 59:37.032
I never said that, Frankie.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.244
Oh, yeah.
That's what you said.

59:41.245 --> 59:42.579
Let me tell you something.

59:43.580 --> 59:46.542
You gonna always
be tied down to me,

59:46.583 --> 59:48.710
whether you like it or not.

59:48.752 --> 59:50.421
We're like magnets.

59:55.092 --> 59:56.051
Mm-mmm.

59:56.093 --> 59:57.219
Frankie, please.

59:57.261 --> 59:59.137
Don't do this to me, Frankie.

59:59.179 --> 01:00:00.972
Don't leave me right now, Zola.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:03.100
I'm married.

01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:05.060
That was a mistake.
That was a mistake!

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:06.562
No! I got a life,
Frankie,

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.063
and it ain't gonna include you.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:09.565
Now you got to go.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.108
Get out!

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:25.747

I didn't see Frankie
for another three years.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:44.099
And then one day,

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:44.891
out of the blue,

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:47.144
he called me up.

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:49.605
And he said that his career
had completely nose-dived.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.607
He wanted to know
if he could come out to LA

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:53.609
and if I could help him
get some gigs.

01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:55.611
I said, "Sure. Come on out."

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.779
'Cause, see, I knew Frankie.

01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:59.781
And I knew
that he needed to sing

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:01.658
like he needed
the air to breathe.

01:01:01.699 --> 01:01:02.659

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.453

Damn, Frankie, you look...

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.629
Well, come over here.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:14.671
All right.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:33.148
Yeah, I got all dressed up
to come on out here.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.733
Well, first you need to
come up out that conk. Yes.

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:37.194
You in LA, baby.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:39.655
Out here, we ain't colored
no more. We're black.

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:40.864
Oh.

01:01:40.905 --> 01:01:42.324
Oh, and you need
to wear these. Really.

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:43.659
Ok. Right on.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.661
It's the law out here, baby.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.162
Groovy, baby.
Groovy!

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:48.163
Dig it.

God, this is far out!

01:02:05.514 --> 01:02:06.848
You'll dig it out here.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.017
I'm already digging it.
Hey! Peace! All right!

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.810
Everybody's into a different bag

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:13.021
out here, Frankie.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:16.567
It was a beautiful day.
I took him to my house.

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:19.027
Frankie couldn't believe
my house.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.198
I don't believe it.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.200
This is... this is beautiful.

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:26.535
Ha ha!

01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:28.203
Whoo! Man!

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:30.247
Y'all got a pool.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.208
Wow. Man,
y'all got every...

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.418
Look at this.

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:35.752
Look at this!

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:39.214
I'm on the top of the world, ma!

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:41.675
Actually, I don't think
it was the day.

01:02:41.717 --> 01:02:43.218
No, no, no. I'm mistaken.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.720
It was nighttime, actually.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.638
Yeah, because I remember...

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.515
The lights were twinkling.

01:02:48.557 --> 01:02:50.016
I'm on top of the world, ma!

01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:52.018
I remember.
It was really romantic.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.520
This is great!

01:02:53.562 --> 01:02:54.521
Wow. Man.

01:02:54.563 --> 01:02:56.064
You got everything.

01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:58.149
Oh.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:00.694
Y'all got an extra
bathtub outside?

01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:03.029
It's a jacuzzi, Frankie.

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:04.948
Oh, a jacuzzi.
I'm gonna try that out.

01:03:04.989 --> 01:03:06.199
Now, look,

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:07.784
you know I'm on leave
from The Platters, right?

01:03:07.825 --> 01:03:08.619
What?

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:09.494
Mm-hmm.

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:11.246
Got walking pneumonia in may.

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:12.706
They changed me
like a light bulb.

01:03:12.748 --> 01:03:15.542
11 years... boom.
I'm out.

01:03:15.584 --> 01:03:18.044
Wow. That's...
That's heavy, man.

01:03:18.086 --> 01:03:20.547
So what you doing now?

01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:23.049
Oh, I got my own little act.

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:26.052
Zola Taylor's all-male revue.

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:27.053
Oh.

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:28.555
I'm doing ok.

01:03:28.597 --> 01:03:30.098
I can see.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.099
Now, look, Frankie,

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.559
this is the guest room, ok?

01:03:32.601 --> 01:03:34.561
You can sleep here
as long as you want

01:03:34.603 --> 01:03:36.062
until you get yourself situated.

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:37.564
That's beautiful.
I appreciate that.

01:03:37.606 --> 01:03:39.065
Wait, I gotta ask you,

01:03:39.107 --> 01:03:41.067
how does your husband
feel about me be...

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:42.068
Frankie, look,

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:43.403
when you called,

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:45.238
I said I might be able
to get you a few gigs.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.574
That's it, ok?
Don't expect nothing else.

01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:49.409
Ok, I'm not, I'm not.

01:03:49.451 --> 01:03:51.077
Ok, it's cool.
I can dig it.

01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:53.955
So tell me, when do
I meet the carpenter?

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:56.792
What?

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:01.254
I divorced him
in Mexico, Frankie.

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:03.089
You divorced him?

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:04.633
In Mexico?

01:04:04.675 --> 01:04:06.134
Where's the divorce decree?

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:09.095
Uh, your honor, there are
extenuating circumstances

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:10.764
regarding the divorce papers.

01:04:10.806 --> 01:04:12.390
But miss Taylor
will testify that...

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:13.684
Miss Taylor?

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:15.101
Actually, your honor,

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:16.645
all my papers got destroyed.

01:04:16.687 --> 01:04:17.937
Well, did you try to get a copy?

01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:19.063
Most certainly.

01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:20.982
I contacted
The Platters' lawyer,

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.526
Ruben Rodriguez,

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:25.111
to see if he could put me
in touch with Mr. Worrell...

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:27.113
He was the attorney
that arranged

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:29.115
the whole Mexican divorce
in the first place.

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:31.618
But, uh, I found out
that he was dead.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.453
Is Mr. Rodriguez alive?

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:35.121
Yes, but he's in the hospital.

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:36.122
He's in the hospital.

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:37.749
Yes, with his feet cut off.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:44.381
Let me just
get a handle on this.

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:46.383
You got divorced in Mexico,

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:48.134
but nobody can find any records.

01:04:48.176 --> 01:04:50.804
Your Mexican divorce papers
were somehow destroyed.

01:04:50.846 --> 01:04:52.806
Your ex-husband is dead,

01:04:52.848 --> 01:04:55.141
your Mexican attorney's dead,

01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:57.644
and your lawyer...

01:04:57.686 --> 01:04:59.979
Your lawyer just had
his feet amputated,

01:05:00.021 --> 01:05:02.232
so he can't come here
to testify for you?

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:04.401
Basically, yes.

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:06.152
Ok.

01:05:06.194 --> 01:05:09.364
Ok, Mr. Roberts,
continue...

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:10.365
Somehow.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:11.825
Thank you, your honor.

01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:13.117
Uh...

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:14.828
Miss Taylor...

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:16.162
Did you marry Frankie Lymon?

01:05:16.204 --> 01:05:17.664
Yes, I did.

01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:19.332
And can you give us
the circumstances

01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:20.792
surrounding your marriage

01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:22.252
to Frankie Lymon?

01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:24.504

01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.982
Wow.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.484
Yes!

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:37.113
I still got the moves.
Ooh oom ooh.

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:38.113
You do, baby.

01:08:38.154 --> 01:08:39.115
You like that?

01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:40.116
Mm-hmm.

01:08:40.157 --> 01:08:41.408
It was like I never left.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:44.120
It was beautiful.
I mean, it was like...

01:08:44.161 --> 01:08:46.122
It was like the waves of <i>love!</i>

01:08:46.162 --> 01:08:48.457
I'm not surprised, Frankie.

01:08:48.499 --> 01:08:50.126
You got it, baby.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:52.127
You still got it.

01:08:52.169 --> 01:08:54.798
Ohh, don't you just love
that feeling

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:58.301
when it seems like
the whole world loves you?

01:08:58.341 --> 01:09:00.428
And they want you,
you know what I mean?

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.554
You're traveling.

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:03.139
You're on the road
going on tours,

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.140
and you're making
all this good money.

01:09:05.182 --> 01:09:07.143
And all of a sudden, man...

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:09.062
It vanishes. It's gone.

01:09:10.187 --> 01:09:12.148
That shit's hard, Z.

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:14.651
It's real hard.

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:17.694
You start feeling like
you're worthless to them.

01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:20.156
All of a sudden, you just...

01:09:20.197 --> 01:09:23.200
Start feeling like you're
worthless to yourself.

01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:26.162
And then you go to the drinking,

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:27.330
drugs.

01:09:27.371 --> 01:09:29.206
You think
that's gonna handle it.

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:31.667
Before you know it,

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:35.087
drinking and drugs
has a handle on you.

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:37.715
That's what happened.

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:40.426
Until tonight.

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:42.053
Because you believed in me.

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:43.554
Uh-uh. No.

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:46.515
Frankie, don't give me
the credit.

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:50.687
You only needed
to believe in <i>you.</i>

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:53.189
And you did that tonight.

01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:55.733
I wanna kiss you, Zola.

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:00.530
Frankie, uh-uh.

01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:02.699
No, I...

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.200
Let's not do that.

01:10:04.241 --> 01:10:06.243
Zola, ain't nobody else for me.

01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:08.705
Listen, I know that.

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:12.208
I love you, Zola.

01:10:12.249 --> 01:10:14.251
Only you.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:17.714
Really?

01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:45.075
Ohh...

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:46.617
Frankie.

01:10:47.618 --> 01:10:49.746
I keep telling myself

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:52.665
that I don't need you.

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:54.500
I do need you, baby.

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:55.501
Let's...

01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:58.046
Let's stop playing.

01:10:58.088 --> 01:10:59.463
Let's get married.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:00.464
Let's get married?

01:11:00.506 --> 01:11:01.674
Yes.
Let's get married.

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:03.051
Frankie.

01:11:03.093 --> 01:11:05.428
You want me to marry you,
Frankie?

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:08.098
Say yes.

And we drove to Tijuana,

and we got married.

01:11:57.354 --> 01:11:58.439
Tijuana?

01:11:58.481 --> 01:11:59.941
Really? In Tijuana.

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:02.944
Now, in your sworn
pretrial deposition,

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:05.155
you, uh...
You said Mexicali.

01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:07.031
Oh, ok.
Mexicali, Tijuana.

01:12:07.073 --> 01:12:09.117
I don't know.

01:12:09.159 --> 01:12:10.493
One of them Mexican towns.

01:12:10.534 --> 01:12:11.995
You are under oath.

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:14.080
Now, did you marry Frankie Lymon

01:12:14.122 --> 01:12:15.915
in either Mexicali or Tijuana?

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:16.916
Yes.

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:18.126
Your honor,

01:12:18.168 --> 01:12:20.128
I have obtained certifications

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:21.629
of nonexistence of marriage

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.631

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:25.216
One from Tijuana, Mexico,

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:26.843
one from Mexicali, Mexico.

01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:29.137
I don't care
what you think you have,

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:31.139
I married Frankie,
and she knows I married Frankie.

01:12:31.181 --> 01:12:32.515
I even showed her my ring.

01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:34.017
You lying.

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:36.144
Miss thing did come to my house,
just like she said,

01:12:36.186 --> 01:12:38.354
but <i>she</i> was the one running
around like a wild banshee,

01:12:38.395 --> 01:12:39.647
not me!

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:44.652
What the hell is going on?

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:48.156
Frankie said I could stay.

01:12:48.198 --> 01:12:49.157
Mmm.

01:12:49.199 --> 01:12:50.241
Frankie said?

01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:52.160
Yes. What part
of "Frankie said"

01:12:52.202 --> 01:12:53.661
don't you understand?

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:55.663
The "Frankie" or the "said"?

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.833
You crazy.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.585

don't you understand?

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:03.171
The "get" or the "out"?

01:13:03.213 --> 01:13:05.173
Oh, god.

01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:06.674
You Zola Taylor!

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:09.635
I'm a big fan of yours!

01:13:09.677 --> 01:13:11.137
Man, you're incredible!

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:13.139
Well, fan your ass
on out of here.

01:13:13.181 --> 01:13:15.183
I don't need this shit, ok?
Forget you.

01:13:15.225 --> 01:13:17.685
And you can take

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:20.813

Your clothes?

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:28.196
See, I can see
why Frankie is sick

01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:31.032
of this whole bullshit LA thing.

01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:32.533

Yes, my husband.

01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:43.544

Frankie, who are these people?

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:02.105
I just saw you
on <i>hullabaloo,</i> man.

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:03.606
Talking 'bout the abc's.

You went and got

01:14:08.069 --> 01:14:09.987
I told you not to invite

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:11.614
L.A.P.D.

01:14:11.655 --> 01:14:12.615
When was you gonna tell me?

01:14:12.656 --> 01:14:13.616
I said no strangers.

01:14:13.657 --> 01:14:15.243

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:18.662
No, I know her.
Put the phone down.

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:20.415
I'm gonna show you.
I'm sick of this!

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.166

Then when I asked Frankie
about it,

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:41.602
he told me that Elizabeth
had broken into the house...

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:42.979
What?

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:44.563
...and told me that
she was married to Frankie

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:46.065
just to hurt my feelings.

01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:48.401
And I believed him
because he was my husband.

01:14:48.443 --> 01:14:49.735
And if he wasn't my husband,

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:52.071
why in the hell
would I have trusted him

01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:54.073
with my most prized possession?

01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:55.699

Come on, now, Z.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.370
Four months on the road
over in Asia?

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:00.955
It's gonna feel like forever.

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:01.956
Frankie,

01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:04.083
you're gonna be just fine.

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:06.085
Can't they give you
a break or something,

01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:07.586
so you can come home and...

01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:09.588
Baby. Baby, listen...

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.090
Take this, ok?

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:12.591
There's enough money here

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:14.260
to pay for the mortgage,
the bills, everything.

01:15:14.302 --> 01:15:16.595
Zola, you know I don't like
taking money from you.

01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:19.098
Baby, it's <i>our</i> money.

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.100
How am I supposed to
remember all this?

01:15:21.142 --> 01:15:23.102
I wrote it down, ok?
You'll find it.

01:15:23.144 --> 01:15:24.603
Are you sure you'll come back?

01:15:24.645 --> 01:15:25.771
I'll be back.

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:27.106
You'll find time
for a break, right?

01:15:27.148 --> 01:15:28.607
It's gonna go by in no time.

01:15:28.649 --> 01:15:30.609
Frankie and I weren't in touch

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:32.111
until about five months later.

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:33.612
One day I called

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:35.114
and my phone was disconnected,

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:37.116
so I asked my sister

01:15:37.158 --> 01:15:39.618
if she would go over
and see what was going on.

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.662
And when she picked me up
from lax,

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:43.164
she told me

01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:45.541
that Frankie had
had some woman at my house

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:48.127
and that a neighbor had
to call the police

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:50.629
because of all the arguing
and fighting going on.

01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:55.092
And I knew exactly
who that woman was, too.

01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:57.553
And then my sister told me

01:15:57.594 --> 01:16:00.139
that I couldn't go home,

01:16:00.181 --> 01:16:02.183
'cause I didn't have one.

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:42.223
Frankie.

01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:51.566
Oh, Frankie.

01:16:56.404 --> 01:16:58.197
Frankie!

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:01.700
Frankie, you fucking
son of a bitch!

01:17:01.742 --> 01:17:03.202
Frankie!

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.603
Everything I'd worked for...

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:31.272
Gone.

01:17:32.607 --> 01:17:33.608
Everything.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.818
When I went to the bank,

01:17:35.859 --> 01:17:38.112
there was no money, either.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.240
I tried to call Frankie
in New York,

01:17:41.282 --> 01:17:43.242
but his numbers
were all disconnected.

01:17:43.284 --> 01:17:47.037
Then I heard he had been
drafted into the army.

01:17:47.079 --> 01:17:49.248
I had nowhere to go,

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:52.293
so I had to move in
with my sister.

01:18:14.649 --> 01:18:17.067
It was a real nice house.

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:20.571
And I'm real sorry
about it. I am.

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:24.325
But I swear to you, Zola,
I never went back up there.

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:28.329
It's been 18 years.

01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:39.798
You'd think I'd be through
with all that by now.

01:18:48.765 --> 01:18:52.019

and address for the records.

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:53.521

01:18:59.193 --> 01:19:01.320
could you state your
educational background

01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:02.697
for the record, please?

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.657
After high school,

01:19:04.699 --> 01:19:06.325
I attended Morris Brown College

01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:08.327
for about a year.

01:19:08.369 --> 01:19:10.954
Then Albany State College,

01:19:10.996 --> 01:19:13.123
Augusta College, Plaine College.

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:16.960
And I've done studies
at Savannah State College,

01:19:17.002 --> 01:19:19.630
as well as
the University of Georgia.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:20.881
Do you hold any degrees?

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:22.799
Is the pope an old white man?

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:24.801
I have a bachelor's degree
in social studies

01:19:24.843 --> 01:19:27.804
as well as a bachelor's degree
in education.

01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:30.474
Now, with all
your accreditations

01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:31.975
and degrees,

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:35.479
how did you come
to meet Frankie Lymon?

01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:36.480
He marched

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:37.981
right into my bathroom.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:40.859
I was getting out of the tub,

01:19:40.901 --> 01:19:41.860
and he said...

01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:43.362
Looking good, doll.

01:19:43.404 --> 01:19:44.488
And I said...

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:45.989
Aah! Get out!

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:48.075
Go! Get out!

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:49.577
Hold up, Emira.
You know who this is?

01:19:49.619 --> 01:19:50.994
I don't care who he is!

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:52.996
It's Frankie Lymon, the singer.

01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:55.165
Tell him to sing
his behind on out!

01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:57.167
Wait, wait, wait.
No disrespect, ma'am.

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:59.002
Eddie said I could grab
a beer from the fridge.

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:01.046
I was only looking
for the kitchen.

01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:05.134
Are there usually toilets
in the kitchen?

01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:09.012
There was a cockiness
about him, you know?

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:10.514
A bravado.

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:12.683
And he was so cute...

01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:14.685
In a real street sort of way.

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:15.894
Let me help you there.

01:20:15.936 --> 01:20:17.020
Shit.

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:18.314
Ohh.

01:20:18.355 --> 01:20:19.649
I'm sorry.

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:21.525
I didn't mean that.
Just wanted to help out.

01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:23.527
They're oatmeal.

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:25.154
I made them myself.

01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:26.530
Em's a great cook.

01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:28.365
She oughta be owning
a restaurant

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:30.033
instead of teaching
crumb-crushers.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:31.827
Mmm. I love oatmeal cookies.

01:20:31.868 --> 01:20:33.036
They're my favorite.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.871
Uh, look,
I really wanna apologize

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:36.373
for barging in on you.

01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:38.542
I didn't mean to walk in
and to see what I...

01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:40.544
Wait, let me introduce
y'all formally.

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:42.045
Uh, Frankie,
this is Emira Eagle,

01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:43.380
my fiancée's sister.

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:46.383
Emira, this is Frankie Lymon.

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:48.511
Nice to meet you.

01:20:48.552 --> 01:20:51.054
Nice to meet you too, Frankie.

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:52.765
After that,
Frankie kept showing up...

01:20:52.807 --> 01:20:53.849
Emira.
Frankie.

01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:55.351
...and showing off.

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:57.728
They're beautiful.
Thank you.

01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:00.063
Well, I was hoping
I could walk you home again.

01:21:00.105 --> 01:21:01.940
Oh. All right.

01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:06.570
He was just incredibly sweet,

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:07.946
a perfect gentleman.

01:21:07.988 --> 01:21:11.617
Never made a pass
or came on strong again.

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:15.454
And he didn't curse around me.

01:21:31.928 --> 01:21:33.055
Hey, Frankie.

01:21:33.096 --> 01:21:34.056
Hey, Emira.

01:21:34.097 --> 01:21:35.725
I brought you a present.

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:38.394
Where'd you find the puppy?

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:39.895
At the pound.

01:21:39.936 --> 01:21:41.188
Can't resist him, huh?

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:43.106
Oh, it is hard.
He's so cute.

01:21:44.775 --> 01:21:46.943
Mmm. What's smelling
so good?

01:21:46.985 --> 01:21:48.445
Chicken and gravy.

01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:51.198
Pecan pie.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.449
You hungry?

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:56.119
You know, Eddie was right.

01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:57.872
You sure can cook.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.081
Thanks.

01:21:59.122 --> 01:22:00.624
The Greens are from my garden.

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:02.125
We would've had carrots,

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:04.127
but the rabbits had
a feast this week.

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:05.379
Yeah?

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:07.130
Well, um, I could make
a net box for you,

01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:08.298
if you like.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.341
Really?

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:13.136
For a city boy,

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:15.138
he was pretty handy
with a hammer...

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:18.642
Just right at home gardening
and working in the earth.

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:19.643
Gardening!

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:20.686
A hammer?

01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:22.145
Frankie wouldn't know a hammer

01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:23.564
if it hit him in the head.

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:24.899
Please, Peter,
object to something,

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:25.900
'cause gardening?

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:27.276
She got to be lying.

01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:30.028
Then one day he just floored me.

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:33.490
Oh, man.

01:22:33.532 --> 01:22:35.158
That was such a good movie.

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.493
Yeah. This way.

01:22:36.535 --> 01:22:38.203
Wow.

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:47.671
Um, Emira...

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:49.673
I wrote something for you.

01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:50.800
Really?

01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:52.050
Yeah.

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:56.513
I hope you like it.

01:22:56.555 --> 01:22:58.557
Uh, don't laugh.

01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:01.184
All right.

01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:02.185
Here goes.

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:07.524
"The wonder of you fills me up,

01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:09.526
"takes me to your depths,

01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:11.528
"and I bare my soul to you,

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:13.739
"o cherished queen of Sheba.

01:23:13.781 --> 01:23:15.532
"When you smile,

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:17.159
you give light."

01:23:18.243 --> 01:23:20.078
"When you speak..."

01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:23.540
"You give life."

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:26.042
"And when you leave,

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:27.628
you take my love."

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:31.548
I fell in love at that moment.

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:32.716
I-it's not finished.

01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:34.134
I still have some more work...

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:35.636
Oh, I love it.

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:37.554
I love it. It's great.

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:39.556
Next day, we got engaged,

01:23:39.598 --> 01:23:41.725
and about a month later,
we got married.

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:52.027
Thank you. Thank you.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:22.766
Don't look.

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:25.101
Oh. Oh, right, right.
I won't look.

01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:28.271
I mean, until you tell me...

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:30.148
When I should look.

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:37.489
Ready?

01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:47.332

Frank G. Lymon.

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:36.733
Yes.

01:26:36.775 --> 01:26:38.276
Come with us.

01:26:38.318 --> 01:26:39.736
For what?
What's the problem?

01:26:39.778 --> 01:26:41.030
Absent without leave.

01:26:41.071 --> 01:26:42.238
Wait. There must be
some misunderstanding.

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.239
Frankie, wait.

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:44.240
No misunderstanding.

01:26:44.282 --> 01:26:45.450
Wait. What's wrong?

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:47.243
Listen, there's some
misunderstanding.

01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:49.079
Get in the back of the Jeep.

01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:51.289
Wait. Where
you taking him?

01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:54.250
It's ok. It's ok.

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:55.585
I'll handle this, all right?

01:26:55.627 --> 01:26:56.920
Just go back in the house.

01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:59.548
He had been awol for four months,

01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:02.092
and he was
dishonorably discharged.

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:03.218
Mrs. Lymon,

01:27:03.259 --> 01:27:04.720
can you tell us

01:27:04.761 --> 01:27:06.763
how long you were
married to Frankie?

01:27:06.805 --> 01:27:08.932
I'm still married to Frankie.

01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:10.017
Thank you, ma'am.

01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:13.187
No further questions,
your honor.

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:14.188
All right,

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:16.106
we'll take our lunch recess

01:27:16.148 --> 01:27:17.774
and resume again at 1:30.

01:28:32.891 --> 01:28:34.226
Thank you.

01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:53.453
Prissy little thing, ain't she?

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:54.871
Mm-hmm.

01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:01.711
Doesn't seem
like Frankie's type.

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:04.047
Seem like anything in a dress

01:29:04.089 --> 01:29:05.423
was Frankie's type.

01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:08.885
Bringing a book to lunch.

01:29:08.927 --> 01:29:11.263
Shit, she should've brought
a damn hairdresser.

01:29:11.305 --> 01:29:12.347
Ooh!

01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:15.767
That was a good one.

01:29:16.768 --> 01:29:17.853
Hmm.

01:29:17.894 --> 01:29:19.229
Aw, Zola.

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:23.441
You know what I'm thinking?

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:26.569
I'm thinking 50% of something

01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:29.281
is sure better
than 100% of nothin'.

01:29:29.323 --> 01:29:31.908
Look, wait, wait.
Check it out.

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:34.577
If I win, we split it 50-50.

01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:37.413
You win, same thing.

01:29:37.455 --> 01:29:39.791
Are you trying to get
in cahoots with me?

01:29:39.833 --> 01:29:41.084
Yeah.

01:29:41.126 --> 01:29:42.585
'Cause I know
I was with Frankie,

01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:44.046
and I know you was with Frankie.

01:29:44.087 --> 01:29:45.047
But her?

01:29:45.088 --> 01:29:47.381
She was with Frankie, too?

01:29:51.011 --> 01:29:52.012
Deal?

01:29:54.139 --> 01:29:55.682
Deal.

01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:57.600
What do you mean
you made a deal?

01:29:57.642 --> 01:29:58.977
Mr. Markowitz.

01:29:59.019 --> 01:30:00.270
No, because it's unconscionable

01:30:00.312 --> 01:30:02.105
for you to cut a deal
and not include me.

01:30:02.147 --> 01:30:03.940
Mr. Markowitz!

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:05.192
I'm sorry.

01:30:05.234 --> 01:30:07.694
Is our little hearing
interrupting you?

01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:09.321
I apologize, your honor.

01:30:09.363 --> 01:30:11.489
Your cross, please.

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:14.701
Behave.

01:30:16.328 --> 01:30:17.620
Uh, miss Eagle,

01:30:17.662 --> 01:30:19.664
when was the last time
you saw Frankie Lymon?

01:30:20.832 --> 01:30:22.125
This is my favorite.

01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:23.626
Little Laura
made this one for me...

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:25.128
You know,
from my second grade class?

01:30:26.338 --> 01:30:28.298
Oh, Frankie, there's the door.

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.424
Put the, uh... this one up, too.

01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:32.468
Yeah!

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:33.553
Postman!

01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:35.138
Got a package for Frankie Lymon.

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:36.223
Oh, all right.

01:30:36.265 --> 01:30:38.850
Sign right there, bro.
You Frankie Lymon?

01:30:38.892 --> 01:30:39.851
Yeah.

01:30:39.893 --> 01:30:40.894
The singer?

01:30:41.686 --> 01:30:42.645
Yeah.

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:43.646
For real?

01:30:43.688 --> 01:30:44.773
Yeah.

01:30:44.814 --> 01:30:47.109
Oh, man, wait till
I tell my wife.

01:30:48.235 --> 01:30:50.153
I thought you was dead.

01:30:50.195 --> 01:30:52.655
Man, we used to dance to
your stuff all the time.

01:30:52.697 --> 01:30:54.157
Man, you great.
You're fantastic.

01:30:54.199 --> 01:30:56.159
Have a happy holiday.
God bless you.

01:30:56.201 --> 01:30:57.411
Frankie Lymon.

01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:59.162
I delivered a package
to Frankie Lymon.

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:00.705
Ha ha! Wow.

01:31:01.706 --> 01:31:02.707
Merry Christmas.

01:31:11.383 --> 01:31:14.177
I know you don't understand
this music business,

01:31:14.219 --> 01:31:16.679
but you're in school,
and you're a teacher.

01:31:16.721 --> 01:31:17.680
You know...

01:31:17.722 --> 01:31:19.515
No, Frankie.
I understand.

01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:20.683
Ok. Ok.

01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:22.685
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:23.686
Your book.

01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:25.188
Yeah.

01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:26.689
Your poetry book.

01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:27.690
Here.

01:31:27.732 --> 01:31:28.691
Oh, great.

01:31:28.733 --> 01:31:30.193
I'm so happy you understand

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:32.446
that this is what
I gotta do, you know?

01:31:32.486 --> 01:31:33.989
It's my life.

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:35.949
Frankie!

01:31:35.991 --> 01:31:36.992
Your lunch.

01:31:37.033 --> 01:31:38.952
Oh! My lunch. Yeah.
All right.

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:40.954
And, uh, I want you
to make me a pecan pie,

01:31:40.996 --> 01:31:42.956
so when I get back

01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:44.458
I can have something
nice for dessert.

01:31:44.498 --> 01:31:45.459
Ok.

01:31:45.499 --> 01:31:46.460
All right.

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.961
I been thinking...

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:49.629
Let's start a family, you know?

01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:51.631
I mean, we got such
a good life here.

01:31:51.673 --> 01:31:53.133
We should share it
with somebody.

01:31:53.175 --> 01:31:54.634
I love you.

01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:55.969
I love you.

01:31:56.011 --> 01:31:57.471
Mmm.
I love you, too.

01:31:57.511 --> 01:31:58.721
Gotta go.

01:31:58.763 --> 01:32:00.474
But you think about
a family, all right?

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:01.475
Ok.

01:32:01.515 --> 01:32:02.684
I'll miss you!

01:32:02.725 --> 01:32:04.186
I'll miss you, too.
I'll be back soon.

01:32:04.227 --> 01:32:05.479
Ok.

01:32:05.519 --> 01:32:06.980
Call me when you get there, ok?

01:32:07.022 --> 01:32:07.981
All right.

01:32:08.023 --> 01:32:09.024
All right.

01:32:13.028 --> 01:32:15.489
That was the last time
I saw him...

01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:17.032
Alive.

01:32:18.408 --> 01:32:19.868
About a week later,

01:32:19.909 --> 01:32:21.161
Frankie's brother called me

01:32:21.203 --> 01:32:22.996
to tell me
that Frankie had overdosed.

01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:28.542
No further questions,
your honor.

01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:32.672
Do you think we could
take an hour's recess,

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:34.007
please, ma'am?

01:32:34.049 --> 01:32:35.509
All right, Mr. Grahme.

01:32:35.549 --> 01:32:37.010
Emira...

01:32:37.052 --> 01:32:40.013
Look, just let me
talk to you for a second.

01:32:40.055 --> 01:32:41.014
Emira!

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:42.849
Emira... Emira, wait!

01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:44.184
Wasn't it enough

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:45.685
I couldn't have him in life?

01:32:45.727 --> 01:32:47.521
Can't I at least
have him in death?

01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:49.022
No!

01:32:49.064 --> 01:32:51.066
None of us can.

01:32:54.403 --> 01:32:56.530
That flat-footed little weirdo

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.532
played all of us.

01:32:58.572 --> 01:33:00.574
He sure did.

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:05.038
Why don't we go have a drink?

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.040
That's a good idea.

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:08.542
Come on.

01:33:08.582 --> 01:33:10.043
But I don't drink.

01:33:10.085 --> 01:33:12.295
Well, honey, you about to start.

01:33:12.337 --> 01:33:13.880
You can have an iced tea
or something.

01:33:13.922 --> 01:33:15.173
You don't have to drink.

01:33:15.215 --> 01:33:18.176
That lying, no-good,
no-bill-paying,

01:33:18.218 --> 01:33:20.053
house-losing bigamist!

01:33:20.095 --> 01:33:21.555
Please.
A <i>trigamist.</i>

01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:23.056
Who gardens, no less.

01:33:23.098 --> 01:33:24.558
Honey, come on.
Frankie and flowers?

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:25.934
Gimme a break.

01:33:25.975 --> 01:33:28.395
I don't even know
what I saw in that little...

01:33:28.437 --> 01:33:30.230
It wasn't like
he was some bronze Adonis

01:33:30.272 --> 01:33:31.565
or some shit.

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:33.191
I thought he was talented.

01:33:33.233 --> 01:33:35.569
Ok, he could sing.

01:33:35.651 --> 01:33:37.070
He could <i>sing</i> me

01:33:37.112 --> 01:33:38.905
right out of my panties.

01:33:38.947 --> 01:33:40.574
I got to give it up for that.

01:33:40.614 --> 01:33:42.200
The boy was a good fuck.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.913
Ohh, come on, Emira.

01:33:46.955 --> 01:33:49.082
Now, you know you got
that rock of Gibraltar.

01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:50.292
Come on now!

01:33:50.333 --> 01:33:52.502
You guys are talking
about my husband.

01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:54.003
Your husband?
Your husband?

01:33:54.045 --> 01:33:55.004
<i>Please.</i>

01:33:55.046 --> 01:33:56.590
He was all of our husbands.

01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:59.092
But I just don't understand.

01:33:59.134 --> 01:34:01.928
How could he write me
those beautiful love poems,

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:04.764
knowing he was still married
to at least one of you?

01:34:04.806 --> 01:34:06.099
Come on now.

01:34:06.141 --> 01:34:07.601
That was Frankie being Frankie.

01:34:07.641 --> 01:34:09.018
Amen.

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:10.770
Frankie just...

01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:12.772
Needed something different

01:34:12.814 --> 01:34:14.107
all the time.

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:15.942
Something different.

01:34:15.984 --> 01:34:17.360
My god, look at us.

01:34:17.402 --> 01:34:19.529
Could we be more different?

01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:20.947
I mean, look at you.

01:34:20.989 --> 01:34:22.740
You're a glamorous singer.

01:34:22.782 --> 01:34:25.118
I'm just a Southern
schoolteacher.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.578
And, you, Elizabeth,
look at you.

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.455
I mean, you...

01:34:28.497 --> 01:34:30.332
I'm not sure
what to think of you.

01:34:30.373 --> 01:34:33.126
I mean, no disrespect.
It's just that...

01:34:33.168 --> 01:34:34.877
What did Frankie see in you?

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:36.171
Ooh.

01:34:37.339 --> 01:34:39.549
Girl, now,
what you talking about?

01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:41.134
Shoot, back in the day,

01:34:41.176 --> 01:34:43.136
I was a sho'nuff fine
foxy thing.

01:34:43.178 --> 01:34:45.138
Tell her, Zola.
You was there. Tell her.

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:46.640
I was there and...

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.308
She was all right.

01:34:50.059 --> 01:34:51.144
No, you didn't.

01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:52.145
But foxy?

01:34:52.187 --> 01:34:53.647
You were more poodley.

01:34:56.858 --> 01:34:58.734
Forget y'all.
Whatever.

01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:02.071
Hey.

01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:04.949
Maybe there were
three separate Frankies,

01:35:04.991 --> 01:35:07.118
and each of us got a piece.

01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:12.040
I think Frankie was like
that broken record.

01:35:12.081 --> 01:35:14.834
Maybe that's what happened
that last day.

01:35:16.336 --> 01:35:18.421
It got so painful...

01:35:18.463 --> 01:35:20.674
He couldn't put himself
back together.

01:35:22.592 --> 01:35:24.469
I just wish
we would've been there

01:35:24.511 --> 01:35:26.804
to save Frankie
from himself that day.

01:35:26.846 --> 01:35:28.640
Girl, you don't know
how many times

01:35:28.682 --> 01:35:30.475
I tried to save Frankie
over the years.

01:35:30.517 --> 01:35:32.018
Shoot, he wore me out.

01:35:33.186 --> 01:35:34.979
It just couldn't be done.

01:35:35.021 --> 01:35:37.482
I wonder who this next
surprise witness is.

01:35:37.524 --> 01:35:39.484
Better not be another woman.

01:35:58.086 --> 01:35:59.379
Hey, how you doing?

01:35:59.421 --> 01:36:00.589
All right.

01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:02.382
Frankie Lymon here
to see Morris Levy.

01:36:02.424 --> 01:36:04.050
Do you have an appointment?

01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:06.886
Uh, no.
Uh, not... not actually.

01:36:06.928 --> 01:36:09.138
Uh, I'm an old friend.

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.806
He knows me, you know?

01:36:10.848 --> 01:36:11.974
Uh-huh.

01:36:12.016 --> 01:36:13.226
Mr. Levy?

01:36:13.268 --> 01:36:15.395
A Mr. Frankie Lemon
is here to see you.

01:36:15.437 --> 01:36:16.688
No, no, no.
Frankie Lymon.

01:36:16.730 --> 01:36:17.731
Get rid of him.

01:36:17.771 --> 01:36:19.357
Hey, Morris!
Long time no see.

01:36:19.399 --> 01:36:20.734
Excuse me!

01:36:20.774 --> 01:36:22.736
You ain't got a minute
to talk to an old buddy

01:36:22.818 --> 01:36:24.571
who's made you
a couple million bucks?

01:36:24.613 --> 01:36:26.906
Hey, Frankie, your last
album was eight years ago,

01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:29.158
so don't pull the "old
friend" bullshit on me.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.410
Now, what can I do for you?

01:36:30.452 --> 01:36:32.786
Look, I'm glad you asked.

01:36:32.828 --> 01:36:34.706
All right, I'm gonna be
straight with you, Morris.

01:36:34.748 --> 01:36:36.249
I'm ready to get back out there.

01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:38.460
Now, I went down south
for a while, and I got married,

01:36:38.501 --> 01:36:41.045
but I've still been writing
and still singing, man,

01:36:41.087 --> 01:36:42.796
and people still
seem to know who I am.

01:36:42.838 --> 01:36:45.049
Jeez, where are the violins?

01:36:45.091 --> 01:36:46.593
No, you don't understand.
I still can do the sp...

01:36:46.635 --> 01:36:48.010
Well, I can't do
the splits right now,

01:36:48.052 --> 01:36:50.012
but I'm telling you,
I still got it.

01:36:50.054 --> 01:36:51.222
Still got it?
Yeah.

01:36:51.264 --> 01:36:53.600
Who the fuck cares,
you still got it?

01:36:53.642 --> 01:36:56.102
In case you don't know it,
doo-wop is dead.

01:36:56.144 --> 01:36:58.563
The Beatles stomped it out,
Motown kicked it out,

01:36:58.605 --> 01:37:00.982
and Hendrix
took it someplace else.

01:37:01.023 --> 01:37:02.275
Now get out of my office.

01:37:02.317 --> 01:37:03.777
No, no, wait, man.
Listen.

01:37:03.817 --> 01:37:05.153
Let me just do a demo
or something.

01:37:05.194 --> 01:37:06.780
Why don't you call one
of your cronies up and...

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:07.947
And what?

01:37:07.989 --> 01:37:09.532
Tell them I got
a blackballed junkie

01:37:09.574 --> 01:37:11.701
in my office
looking for a comeback?

01:37:11.743 --> 01:37:13.119
Hold on now, Morris.

01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:15.246
You're taking it
too far now, ok?

01:37:15.288 --> 01:37:16.498
I'm not a junkie any...

01:37:16.539 --> 01:37:18.541
I don't shoot up, man.
I'm clean.

01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:20.293
Please! You shoot up,

01:37:20.335 --> 01:37:21.877
and you're a no-show at gigs.

01:37:21.919 --> 01:37:25.131
Hey, only an asshole
takes a chance on a junkie.

01:37:25.173 --> 01:37:27.300
I told you I'm not
a fucking junkie!

01:37:27.342 --> 01:37:28.718
Didn't you just hear me?!

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.261
Do you know who the fuck
you're talking to, huh?

01:37:30.303 --> 01:37:31.971
You see what I mean?!
This is why

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:33.556
you're not booked
at the Orpheum tonight!

01:37:33.598 --> 01:37:35.308
You understand that?
You're a crazed maniac.

You're not a cute kid

01:43:13.228 --> 01:43:14.480
He was so talented.

01:43:14.522 --> 01:43:17.441
Mr. Levy, do you
know what this is?

01:43:17.483 --> 01:43:20.695
Yeah. Sure. It's <i>why</i>
<i>do fools fall in love.</i>

01:43:20.736 --> 01:43:24.782
Oh, uh, Mr. Levy, whose names
appear as songwriters on this?

01:43:24.824 --> 01:43:26.199
Lymon and Levy.

01:43:26.241 --> 01:43:29.037
Uh-huh. Well,
how did this come about,

01:43:29.078 --> 01:43:31.164
you writing the song
with Frankie?

01:43:31.204 --> 01:43:32.456
I don't understand.

01:43:32.498 --> 01:43:34.876
Did you two sit down
together at the piano,

01:43:34.917 --> 01:43:36.502
uh, he plays some music...

01:43:36.544 --> 01:43:38.838
No, no, no.
You get together,

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:41.256
and you kind of put the words

01:43:41.298 --> 01:43:43.634
and the music together.
You get a beat going.

01:43:43.676 --> 01:43:44.802
I mean, I'm not saying

01:43:44.844 --> 01:43:46.721
that I'm writing
songs like Chopin.

01:43:46.762 --> 01:43:47.763
Like Chopin.

01:43:49.431 --> 01:43:52.560
That's very funny.
Very funny, Mr. Levy.

01:43:52.601 --> 01:43:55.897
It's not quite as funny
as this, though.

01:43:55.938 --> 01:44:00.902
Now, whose names are listed
as songwriters on this record?

01:44:00.943 --> 01:44:03.278
It's "Lymon, Santiago,
and Goldner."

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.322
Uh-huh. As in
Herman Santiago,

01:44:05.364 --> 01:44:07.658
the original lead singer
of The Teenagers?

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:09.077
What's the name of this song?

01:44:09.118 --> 01:44:10.411
<i>Why do fools fall in love.</i>

01:44:10.452 --> 01:44:12.121
<i>Why do fools fall in love.</i>

01:44:12.163 --> 01:44:15.332
So, in fact, Mr. Levy,
you didn't write the song.

01:44:15.374 --> 01:44:17.376
You just slapped your name on it

01:44:17.418 --> 01:44:19.420
so you could collect
songwriter royalties

01:44:19.461 --> 01:44:21.089
and copyright entitlements.

01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:23.132
Listen, counselor,
I'm a businessman.

01:44:23.174 --> 01:44:24.633
It was just business.

01:44:24.675 --> 01:44:28.054
Mr. Levy, how much money
have you made over the years

01:44:28.096 --> 01:44:30.639
from the song
<i>why do fools fall in love?</i>

01:44:30.681 --> 01:44:31.640
Who knows?

01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:33.266
Try $4 million, Mr. Levy.

01:44:33.308 --> 01:44:34.602
$4 million!

01:44:34.643 --> 01:44:36.104
Shh.

01:44:37.230 --> 01:44:38.940
And how much of
that money, Mr. Levy,

01:44:38.981 --> 01:44:41.274
have you tried to pay
to Frankie Lymon's estate?

01:44:41.316 --> 01:44:42.944
I got accountants
for that kind of stuff.

01:44:42.985 --> 01:44:46.488
The answer is zero,
Mr. Levy. Nothing.

01:44:46.530 --> 01:44:49.282
Not one single penny,
Mr. Levy!

01:44:49.324 --> 01:44:50.785
No further questions,
your honor.

01:44:50.826 --> 01:44:52.078
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:53.328
You're all acting

01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:55.664
like I was the only one
doing business that way.

01:44:55.706 --> 01:44:57.625
Everyone was doing it.
Every record producer,

01:44:57.666 --> 01:44:59.961
every owner of a label,
every promoter.

01:45:00.002 --> 01:45:01.796
It was standard
industry practice.

01:45:01.837 --> 01:45:03.256
All right, Mr. Levy,
that's enough.

01:45:03.296 --> 01:45:04.966
And another thing, there
would be no Frankie Lymon

01:45:05.007 --> 01:45:05.800
if it wasn't for me.

01:45:05.841 --> 01:45:07.051
I discovered him first.

01:45:07.093 --> 01:45:08.719
I invested in him first.

01:45:08.761 --> 01:45:10.429
I promoted him first.

01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:13.099
And you're sitting here
talking like I'm the one

01:45:13.141 --> 01:45:14.976
who put that smack
into his veins.

01:45:15.017 --> 01:45:17.561
All right, Mr. Levy,
I said that is enough.

01:45:17.603 --> 01:45:18.980
I just wanted you to know...

01:45:19.021 --> 01:45:20.856
Mr. Levy,
you are excused.

01:45:20.898 --> 01:45:22.191
Thank you very much.

01:45:22.233 --> 01:45:23.525
You're welcome.

01:45:23.567 --> 01:45:27.280
All right, we're going
to adjourn for today.

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:29.198
We'll reconvene
tomorrow morning at 9:00

01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:31.742
at which time
I will render my decision.

01:45:31.784 --> 01:45:33.410
Thank you.

01:45:33.452 --> 01:45:34.870
Scotch and soda.

01:45:34.912 --> 01:45:36.329
Strawberry Margarita.

01:45:36.371 --> 01:45:37.456
Iced tea, please.

01:45:37.498 --> 01:45:39.750
Long island iced tea.

01:45:39.792 --> 01:45:42.628
$4 million. Do y'all
believe that shit?

01:45:42.670 --> 01:45:43.754
Mm-mmm.

01:45:43.796 --> 01:45:45.089
Shit, when Frankie was alive,

01:45:45.131 --> 01:45:47.008
he didn't have two nickels
to rub together.

01:45:47.049 --> 01:45:48.301
I heard that.

01:45:48.341 --> 01:45:49.927
Money like that
I only read about

01:45:49.969 --> 01:45:50.970
in <i>fortune</i> magazine.

01:45:51.012 --> 01:45:53.014
You read <i>fortune?</i>

01:45:53.055 --> 01:45:57.350
Yes. It's got forecasts,
futures, you know, stock tips.

01:45:57.392 --> 01:45:58.602
Oh, thank you.

01:46:00.062 --> 01:46:01.063
Mmm.

01:46:01.105 --> 01:46:02.564
Mmm.

01:46:04.775 --> 01:46:06.735
Mmm. Mmm.

01:46:12.574 --> 01:46:14.743
That is delicious.

01:46:14.785 --> 01:46:17.163
That long island iced tea
flavoring is tasty.

01:46:17.205 --> 01:46:18.998
Ooh, excuse me.

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:46:21.042 --> 01:46:22.251
Ooh.

01:46:25.713 --> 01:46:29.050
You know, I wish we could
rethink this whole court case

01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:31.219
and refuse to let
our lives be dictated

01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:33.888
by Morris and Frankie
and all these vultures.

01:46:33.929 --> 01:46:36.057
Honey, I wish we could
tell our lawyers

01:46:36.098 --> 01:46:39.643
to kiss our big butts.

01:46:39.685 --> 01:46:41.812
Well, here is to telling
all of our lawyers

01:46:41.854 --> 01:46:43.898
to kiss our big butts.

01:46:43.939 --> 01:46:45.566
Big butts!

01:46:45.607 --> 01:46:47.902
Juicy booties.

01:46:47.943 --> 01:46:51.404
Ooh, 'cause I know my butt
has gotten a little big.

01:46:51.446 --> 01:46:52.698
But you know what, ladies?

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:55.576
Why don't we tell all
of them where to go

01:46:55.617 --> 01:46:57.452
and walk out of here friends?

01:46:57.494 --> 01:46:59.038
Baby, I could be
a much better friend

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:00.373
with 4 million bucks.

01:47:00.413 --> 01:47:02.583
Wait. If we do your plan,
we can all...

01:47:02.624 --> 01:47:03.625
What plan?

01:47:03.667 --> 01:47:04.960
What are you talking about?

01:47:05.002 --> 01:47:06.962
Wasn't it you that said
50% of something

01:47:07.004 --> 01:47:08.756
is better than no percent
of nothing?

01:47:08.797 --> 01:47:10.258
Then you split
your 50% with her.

01:47:10.299 --> 01:47:12.551
What about you?
It's gonna be 30-30-30.

01:47:12.593 --> 01:47:13.594
Excuse me.

01:47:13.635 --> 01:47:16.805
Excuse me!

01:47:16.847 --> 01:47:18.182
What are y'all talking about?

01:47:18.224 --> 01:47:20.142
'Cause whatever it is,
it sounds illegal to me.

01:47:20.184 --> 01:47:22.103
No.
No.

01:47:22.144 --> 01:47:23.104
It's not illegal.

01:47:23.145 --> 01:47:25.189
It is not illegal.

01:47:25.231 --> 01:47:26.941
It sounds illegal.

01:47:26.982 --> 01:47:28.109
We can do what we want.

01:47:28.150 --> 01:47:29.235
It was her idea.

01:47:29.277 --> 01:47:30.819
It sounds illegal to me.

01:47:30.861 --> 01:47:32.405
Fuck it, all right?

01:47:32.445 --> 01:47:35.157
Look, here's the deal:
Whoever won, me and her,

01:47:35.199 --> 01:47:36.867
we was gonna split it 50-50.

01:47:36.909 --> 01:47:38.244
Now we can cut you in.

01:47:38.286 --> 01:47:39.954
We don't need to leave here

01:47:39.995 --> 01:47:43.332
until we can make
a deal to get paid.

01:47:43.374 --> 01:47:44.959
Come on, Emira.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.878
That is a million-
three-hundred gs each.

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:50.381
Each?

01:47:50.423 --> 01:47:51.424
Each.
Each.

01:47:56.011 --> 01:47:58.097
Well, I could use a new car.

01:47:58.139 --> 01:48:00.808
You could get yourself
a Cadillac, girl.

01:48:00.849 --> 01:48:02.101
Brougham!

01:48:02.143 --> 01:48:06.647
Ooh, well, that is
Kool and The Gang!

01:48:06.688 --> 01:48:08.149
Yeah!

01:48:08.190 --> 01:48:10.776
I knew we could get her.

01:48:10.818 --> 01:48:14.863

01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:20.786
♪ You met someone, and now

01:48:24.039 --> 01:48:25.458
What was at issue in this case

01:48:25.498 --> 01:48:28.461
was determining which
of the three alleged widows

01:48:28.501 --> 01:48:32.340
is the lawful surviving
spouse of Frankie Lymon.

01:48:32.381 --> 01:48:35.009
Widow number one,
Elizabeth Waters,

01:48:35.050 --> 01:48:37.510
claimed
that she and Frankie Lymon

01:48:37.552 --> 01:48:39.930
lived as common-law
husband and wife

01:48:39.972 --> 01:48:42.808
and that they were married
in a civil ceremony

01:48:42.850 --> 01:48:44.185
in the state of Virginia,

01:48:44.226 --> 01:48:45.853
and all of this, apparently,

01:48:45.894 --> 01:48:48.730
while she was still married
to someone else.

01:48:50.941 --> 01:48:53.986
Now, widow number two,
Zola Taylor,

01:48:54.028 --> 01:48:55.363
claims that she married
Frankie Lymon

01:48:55.404 --> 01:48:57.948
in either Tijuana or Mexicali,

01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:59.492
depending upon which day
of the week it is.

01:48:59.532 --> 01:49:03.120
But, unfortunately,
miss Taylor was unable

01:49:03.162 --> 01:49:05.831
to provide any substantive proof

01:49:05.873 --> 01:49:08.501
of either her marriages
or her divorces.

01:49:08.541 --> 01:49:12.171
Which brings us
to widow number three,

01:49:12.213 --> 01:49:13.839
Emira Eagle,

01:49:13.881 --> 01:49:16.633
who was married to Frankie
in a church ceremony

01:49:16.675 --> 01:49:18.677
replete with white wedding gown

01:49:18.719 --> 01:49:21.347
and a honeymoon suite
in Augusta, Georgia,

01:49:21.389 --> 01:49:24.683
and all of this would
have been well and good,

01:49:24.725 --> 01:49:26.685
except for the fact
that New York state

01:49:26.727 --> 01:49:28.229
upholds the Pennsylvania law

01:49:28.270 --> 01:49:30.105
which recognizes
common-law marriage

01:49:30.147 --> 01:49:31.857
as legal and binding.

01:49:31.899 --> 01:49:35.194
And since Elizabeth continued
to live with Frankie

01:49:35.236 --> 01:49:37.570
after her divorce
from Charles Phillips

01:49:37.612 --> 01:49:41.409
and based on the statutes...
<i>Cross vs. Cross,</i>

01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:43.285
<i>commonwealth vs. Highland,</i>

01:49:43.327 --> 01:49:44.828
<i>and Skinner vs. Skinner...</i>

01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:48.707
Both the common-law marriage
and the Virginia marriage

01:49:48.749 --> 01:49:50.042
were indeed valid,

01:49:50.084 --> 01:49:52.627
and since neither marriage
was dissolved

01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:54.547
at the time of Frankie's death,

01:49:54.587 --> 01:49:56.382
it is the determination
of this court

01:49:56.424 --> 01:50:01.262
that the lawful, surviving
spouse of frank Joseph Lymon

01:50:01.303 --> 01:50:03.305
is Elizabeth Waters Lymon.

01:50:03.347 --> 01:50:04.765
Yeah!
Yes!

01:50:04.806 --> 01:50:06.392
I told you!

01:50:06.434 --> 01:50:08.227
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:50:08.269 --> 01:50:09.395
We did it!

01:50:09.437 --> 01:50:11.105
Aah!

01:50:11.146 --> 01:50:13.732
Stop! See,
she said that we won,

01:50:13.774 --> 01:50:15.734
so that mean that y'all lost,

01:50:15.776 --> 01:50:16.985
so talk to the hand,

01:50:17.027 --> 01:50:18.904
'cause me and my counselor
got to go.

01:50:18.946 --> 01:50:20.114
What?!

01:50:20.155 --> 01:50:22.950
You Jheri curl-wearing,
ghetto bitch!

01:50:22.991 --> 01:50:24.617
I'm gonna whup your ass!

01:50:24.659 --> 01:50:25.911
Order in the court.

01:50:27.162 --> 01:50:28.747
Elizabeth won

01:50:28.789 --> 01:50:32.126
and told the rest of us
exactly where to go.

01:50:33.626 --> 01:50:34.962
She got us.

01:50:35.003 --> 01:50:36.547
But, you know, hey,
I didn't really care,

01:50:36.589 --> 01:50:39.383
because I was tired of
the courts and the lawyers

01:50:39.425 --> 01:50:40.968
and the whole thing anyway.

01:50:41.009 --> 01:50:42.470
I wasn't having it.

01:50:42.511 --> 01:50:44.805
I filed suit in
the U.S. court of appeals.

01:50:44.846 --> 01:50:47.808
It was a mess.
It took years.

01:50:47.849 --> 01:50:49.602
But they ruled in my favor.

01:50:49.642 --> 01:50:51.270
So, you see,

01:50:51.312 --> 01:50:54.607
the schoolteacher
won Frankie's estate after all.

01:50:54.647 --> 01:50:58.860
But the final tee-hee-hee
was on her.

01:50:58.902 --> 01:51:01.989
See, Frankie's estate wasn't
nowhere near no $4 million.

01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:03.616
And after all miss thing's

01:51:03.656 --> 01:51:06.577
lawyers' legal fees
and expenses,

01:51:06.619 --> 01:51:09.288
she only ended up with 15 grand.

01:51:09.330 --> 01:51:10.663
The same amount

01:51:10.705 --> 01:51:13.417
that Morris had offered her
from jump street.

01:51:13.459 --> 01:51:15.836
Now, ain't that nothin'?

01:51:15.877 --> 01:51:17.129
Well, honey,
I could've told them

01:51:17.171 --> 01:51:19.256
wasn't none of them
gonna get no money!

01:51:19.298 --> 01:51:21.467
