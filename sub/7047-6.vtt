00:02.628 --> 00:04.003
Previously on Justified...

00:04.088 --> 00:07.924
I got a call this morning
from AUSA David Vasquez.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.301
He wants Ava to come up to Lexington.

00:10.386 --> 00:13.346
- Raylan, you can't sleep with her.
- I know.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.847
- Raylan...
- I won't.

00:15.182 --> 00:19.143
Is there a part of you
that's just disappointed?

00:19.395 --> 00:21.854
- Disappointed?
- In that you raised such an idiot.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.523
Weren't no drugs on me.

00:27.277 --> 00:32.281
I got you out of jail.
At the very least, I'll get you back in.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.463
Why, hello, there, Raylan.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.383
Hello, Boyd. How you doing?

00:50.467 --> 00:53.970
The food isn't as advertised,
and there was no mint on my pillow,

00:54.096 --> 00:58.474
so I don't think that I would
come back to this particular hotel.

00:59.643 --> 01:04.021
But it is better than Alderson
or maybe I'm better.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.023
See, I've done a lot of bad things in my life.

01:06.108 --> 01:10.319
But what I know now is that the only hope
that I have of saving my own soul

01:10.654 --> 01:12.989
is by helping to save the soul of others.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.658
But I can see by the glazing of your eyes

01:15.743 --> 01:19.454
that you didn't ask to see me because
you wanted to hear about my ministry.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.998
How can I help you, Raylan?

01:24.960 --> 01:26.669
I saw Arlo the other day.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.254
How did that go?

01:30.841 --> 01:34.510
I want to know everything you know
about what he's up to.

01:35.679 --> 01:38.681
Well, if I tell you, what do I get?

01:38.807 --> 01:39.849
What do you want?

01:39.933 --> 01:42.101
You understand what it is
that you're asking for.

01:42.186 --> 01:46.355
I mean,
me asking people in here about your daddy,

01:46.523 --> 01:49.192
that could put me
in a very compromising position.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.360
You want me to arrange for
that mint on your pillow?

01:51.653 --> 01:54.322
No, Raylan.
The only thing that I want you to do

01:55.365 --> 02:01.454
is to think about your immortal soul.
You are a violent man, my friend.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.457
You have left a trail of dead behind you.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.794
You think about it, the life that you've led,
the work that you've done.

02:07.878 --> 02:11.464
At one moment, you could be
breaking into the home of a fugitive,

02:12.007 --> 02:14.717
and the very next moment,
you could be facing your final judgment.

02:14.802 --> 02:20.515
Now, how do you think that you're going to
fare on that glorious day, Raylan Givens?

02:21.141 --> 02:22.725
It's always a good question.

02:23.393 --> 02:26.020
It's the most important question there is.

03:09.815 --> 03:15.987
Raylan. Raylan, honey, I made you coffee.

03:22.035 --> 03:26.956
- It's from a machine.
- Yes, it is.

03:33.338 --> 03:36.674
- What you got there?
- The classified ads.

03:38.093 --> 03:42.597
You already got a job.
I'm still waiting on a free haircut.

03:43.849 --> 03:46.976
Free nothing. Maybe a discount.

03:48.812 --> 03:54.191
I'm looking for an apartment. I can make
a mean cup of coffee when I got a kitchen.

03:55.694 --> 04:00.031
- This ain't that bad.
- I wouldn't mind a couple of closets, either.

04:00.449 --> 04:01.490
A couple?

04:01.909 --> 04:06.037
Look at you, thinking I'm all hot
and bothered for us to move in together.

04:06.538 --> 04:11.500
You're tarnished with the dark stain
of D-l-V-O-R-C-E.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.587
My marriage ended a little more
amicably than yours.

04:15.756 --> 04:19.007
Funny. Why did your marriage end?

04:20.135 --> 04:22.845
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.436
I ran into that Johnny Crowder the other day.

04:31.104 --> 04:35.107
Yeah? Johnny Crowder
doesn't make my stomach turn.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.902
I'm glad you feel that way.
He gave me a little heads-up,

04:37.986 --> 04:41.322
asked me to pass it on to you.
Bo is getting his release soon.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.951
Johnny thought you might want
to get out of Kentucky.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.498
It will take more than that to get me gone.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.709
- Ava.
- Since I was 19 years old,

04:53.794 --> 04:57.546
I always dreamed if I saved enough money,
I'd move to Lexington.

05:00.968 --> 05:04.679
Raylan, you probably don't remember
what a relief it is to walk around every day

05:04.930 --> 05:06.347
and all you see is strangers.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.226
I can walk into a store or a coffee shop.

05:11.186 --> 05:14.146
Nobody knows anything about me
or my family

05:14.856 --> 05:17.483
or if I sleep in a nightie or buck naked.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.568
I can answer that last one.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.992
At any rate, I ain't leaving,
Bo Crowder notwithstanding.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.330
- Hello!
- Good morning, sunshine.

05:43.927 --> 05:44.969
What's up?

05:46.888 --> 05:49.306
Well, I was gonna apologize for being late.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.642
For what?

05:51.727 --> 05:54.812
You know that little cell phone thing
that we issue to all the Marshals?

05:55.022 --> 05:57.690
You should turn that on once in a while,
check your messages.

05:58.150 --> 06:00.526
- You want me to check them now?
- No, I'll just repeat myself.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.069
I don't have anything better to do.

06:02.571 --> 06:05.031
The first message was
that everything's in place.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.199
We got a team at the plane and at the house.

06:07.325 --> 06:10.244
The banks are ready to go, and the
indictment's gonna be here in about an hour.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.579
You've been saying that for days.

06:11.663 --> 06:15.124
The second message is that we've got to go
to Cincinnati to pick up this art dealer,

06:15.250 --> 06:16.917
'cause Carnes is trying
to sell some paintings.

06:17.169 --> 06:19.545
- I have to go with you?
- Would I be here if you didn't?

06:20.589 --> 06:24.091
- Are you cold standing out here?
- Not really. Why?

06:24.509 --> 06:26.844
'Cause I can't keep from staring
at your nipples.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.892
- I'll be out in 10.
- Thank you.

06:36.146 --> 06:40.566
Raylan, in the interest of clarity, I'm gonna
be as straightforward about this as possible.

06:41.777 --> 06:46.113
What's your problem?
Tell me that wasn't Ava in there.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.450
- You really want me to answer that?
- Oh, good God.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.161
No, I don't want you to answer that.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.206
You didn't hear a damn thing
I said about that, did you?

06:55.290 --> 06:57.083
- I heard.
- You know that AUSA

06:57.167 --> 06:59.335
is still sniffing around on your trail,
that David Vasquez.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.296
- Yes, I know. I know.
- Be smart, then.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.299
Let me tell you something.
There are other things than smart.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.385
Yeah. Those are not smart.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.936
- Look.
- Yeah.

07:17.437 --> 07:21.107
Excuse me, Karl Hanselman?
We're with the US Marshals Service.

07:21.817 --> 07:24.652
- That still exists?
- Yeah. We like to keep a low profile.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.864
We understand that Owen Carnes contacted
you trying to sell some paintings.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.074
You've been eavesdropping.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.243
You know Mr. Carnes?
You know what he's facing?

07:32.327 --> 07:33.369
I read the papers.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.538
Then you know
that we'd put a tap on his toaster

07:35.622 --> 07:37.039
if we thought it would get us anything.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.875
Just idle curiosity,
but how much money did Carnes take?

07:40.043 --> 07:42.169
Ten years ago,
it probably would have made the front page.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.171
But after Madoff, it'll barely register.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.841
How can I help you?

08:03.733 --> 08:05.401
- Mr. Carnes.
- Did you bring it?

08:05.527 --> 08:06.861
I did.

08:07.821 --> 08:08.904
Who are these guys?

08:09.573 --> 08:12.366
- We're with the US Marshals.
- What do you want?

08:12.450 --> 08:15.035
As of noon today, the US Marshals Service

08:15.120 --> 08:18.539
has assumed responsibility
for all your assets. You've been served.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.750
You haven't even arrested me yet.
You don't have an indictment.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.752
Well, that's coming, Mr. Carnes.
You know that.

08:23.879 --> 08:28.591
We're kind of in a gray area here,
but basically, you can still sell things.

08:28.675 --> 08:32.135
It's just that we're gonna hold on
to the funds until this issue is resolved.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.388
Do you still want me to come in?

08:34.472 --> 08:38.308
It takes a lot of the fun out of it, doesn't it?
Yeah, come on in.

08:40.937 --> 08:44.648
- You have a lot of art.
- It's my wife's.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.527
She and her art buyer, David Mortimer,
bought it.

08:50.614 --> 08:53.657
He's an annoying little shit,
but I got to hand it to him.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.744
He certainly got me what I wanted.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.084
Here they are.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.549
As you know,
they're very hard to authenticate.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.510
- Where did your buyer find them?
- A dealer in Prague.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.846
- May I examine them?
- Have at it.

09:17.182 --> 09:21.602
I don't want to sell the Hitlers,
but, well, you know the situation I'm in.

09:23.021 --> 09:27.399
Even if I hand you my bagful of money,
the deputy will take it away from you.

09:27.651 --> 09:30.277
Well, I don't care about the money.
I care about the history.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.947
- How many Hitlers you have?
- Forty-two.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.198
Forty-two Hitlers?

09:34.532 --> 09:38.494
Good Lord. I'd sure love to come by
and see them one day.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.997
When you get out of prison,
you'll have to come to Cincinnati.

09:42.123 --> 09:46.502
I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt.
I know it's really none of our business,

09:46.586 --> 09:51.715
but when you say Hitler,
do you mean Adolf Hitler?

09:51.883 --> 09:54.009
Yeah. He didn't tell you?

09:55.262 --> 09:58.097
These paintings here were all painted
by Adolf Hitler.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.183
You can't get any closer to history
than this right here.

10:01.685 --> 10:05.354
- Just so you know, I ain't no Nazi lover.
- Do you have a bathroom?

10:05.855 --> 10:08.357
- What?
- Bathroom. May I use your bathroom?

10:09.025 --> 10:12.194
Yeah. Out the door to the left, down the hall.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.738
You'll smell my wife's scented candles
before you get there.

10:25.792 --> 10:26.875
Can I help you?

10:26.960 --> 10:31.046
Mrs. Carnes,
I'm Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.548
Where's my husband?

10:33.216 --> 10:37.511
He's in the den with a collector,
looking at some paintings.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.431
His last night of freedom, and he's talking
to someone about his Hitlers?

10:40.640 --> 10:43.225
- He's trying to sell them.
- I hope he succeeds.

10:43.476 --> 10:48.063
I hate those damn things.
Who in the hell buys Hitler paintings?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.151
So, what are you doing here, Deputy?

10:52.235 --> 10:56.322
We served your husband with an order
of forfeiture. Do you know what that is?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.074
- Do I care?
- You should.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.993
Anything I can do about it right now?

11:01.453 --> 11:03.829
- Not really.
- Then I don't care.

11:05.957 --> 11:09.335
Do you want a drink? I guess you can't.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.462
I won't tell if you won't.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.758
I suppose you should tell me
about this order you served.

11:16.176 --> 11:20.220
Under an order of forfeiture,
we hold on to everything the accused owns.

11:20.305 --> 11:24.266
Small, high-value items, like your art, we'll
move to a secure location, where it stays.

11:24.601 --> 11:28.312
We auction it off if the US Attorney
proves it was obtained by illegal gain.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.688
Mrs. Carnes.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.733
Greg, this Deputy Givens.
Deputy, this is Greg Davis.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.736
He does most of the hands-on training
of the horses. Best in the business.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.988
I'm not half the rider that Mrs. Carnes is.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.616
Stop kissing my ass, Greg.
You'll be out of a job tomorrow.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.117
I'm here now. Anything you need?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.787
I don't know.
Are the horses staying or going?

11:44.871 --> 11:46.288
Staying for now.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.916
Work Max and Ringo if you can.
Max was shying at the Liverpool.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.751
Yes, ma'am. Pleasure.

11:53.088 --> 11:56.632
All those years teaching rich kids
to sit a trot, scraping to get by.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.677
And then I met Owen. I taught his girls.

12:00.804 --> 12:04.807
The wife didn't care about riding,
but Owen did. Well, he cared about me.

12:06.101 --> 12:11.146
I went from doing everything,
grooming, feeding, looking out,

12:11.314 --> 12:15.275
to being handed the reins of the most
magnificent creatures ready to ride.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.654
Now you're telling me I'm gonna lose it all.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.032
Anything you paid for with your
own earnings, you get to keep.

12:24.661 --> 12:31.625
I'm gonna lose it all.
Goddamn son of a bitch. That fat bastard.

12:32.502 --> 12:35.254
If I'd only charged him by the blow job,
I'd be independently rich by now

12:35.338 --> 12:37.965
instead of getting dragged off
by his shit tornado.

12:39.342 --> 12:43.720
He thought he was so smart.
All his Jew lawyers can't help him now.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.348
I'll bet he never told them
about his Hitler collection.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.019
I better get back.

12:52.480 --> 12:56.525
Don't go all PC on me now, Deputy.
I thought you were a good ol' boy.

12:59.028 --> 13:02.406
Bullshit. You said the Hitlers
were hard to authenticate.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.034
Usually they are, but these were easy
because they're obviously fakes.

13:06.244 --> 13:09.538
You got to be wrong. Cost me $300,000.

13:09.831 --> 13:13.208
Then I suggest you speak to whomever sold
them to you and get your money back.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.671
Get David Mortimer over here.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.595
- Did you know Hitler was a painter?
- Not until today.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.723
He did it mostly when he was younger,
before World War I.

13:27.891 --> 13:30.225
Before he got into mass murder and so on.

13:30.393 --> 13:33.228
What kind of a son of a bitch
would collect something like that?

13:35.106 --> 13:38.025
I once met a man
who made elaborate and detailed

13:38.234 --> 13:41.403
model reconstructions
of famous aviation disasters.

13:42.697 --> 13:45.449
Tenerife, Sioux City, Lockerbie.

13:46.409 --> 13:49.745
These scaled-down fuselages,
blackened and torn,

13:49.871 --> 13:51.872
little engines and furrowed earth.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.292
I don't know.
I figure people are entitled to their hobbies,

13:55.418 --> 14:01.632
and I'm entitled to think
those people are creepy. No offense, Karl.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.385
Next time you're in Cincinnati, come by
the gallery. I'll show you my collection.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.304
I think you'll be quite surprised.

14:07.764 --> 14:11.308
Honestly, I think I'd rather stick my dick
in a blender.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.393
That might solve a few problems.

14:14.896 --> 14:17.606
- Why'd you sell Owen fakes?
- I didn't. These are real.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.567
- Tell the truth, David.
- I am. Hanselman's lying.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.444
Why would he lie?

14:22.820 --> 14:24.613
Owen, please.
He wants to get them from you for cheap.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.740
These are real Hitlers. I swear to God.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.409
Well, then you wouldn't mind
buying them back from me.

14:32.121 --> 14:36.542
- No, of course not.
- Owen, he's lying. You can't trust him.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.962
- I don't.
- Tell the truth! Where'd they come from?

14:50.265 --> 14:52.599
All right, I'll get the electric blanket.
You do the second shot.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.644
All right. Now, according
to this Discovery Channel show I saw,

14:55.770 --> 14:57.854
this warming-blanket business
only works so long.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.940
Okay. What are you doing? Go on.
Don't throw up.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.609
- You don't want your DNA on the carpet.
- Why?

15:03.695 --> 15:05.988
Why do you think?
They can't put a dead man on trial.

15:06.114 --> 15:10.284
The case against Owen will get dismissed.
His kids will get some, but I'll get most of it.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.035
- Shit!
- What?

15:12.370 --> 15:14.788
- I don't think he's dead.
- Oh, my God! He's alive?

15:15.164 --> 15:18.667
- JFK was alive for hours!
- We don't have hours.

15:18.793 --> 15:22.170
Honey, JFK had the best doctors
in the world. Owen's got nothing.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.172
He won't last long.
We'll just give him a few minutes.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.092
If he keeps making noises, we can always
pinch his nose and cover his mouth.

15:27.176 --> 15:31.805
Now, just do the second shot. There you go.
Come on, baby. Come on.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.727
Oh, my God! What the hell are you doing?

15:36.853 --> 15:38.687
I had to get gunpowder on his hands.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.189
And all of this had to be done
in front of me?

15:43.401 --> 15:45.611
Well, did you or did you not sell Owen
those fake Hitlers?

15:45.695 --> 15:48.238
Oh, my God! That was your idea!

15:48.823 --> 15:51.700
Yes, and you happily took your half
of the proceeds.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.410
Wait. What's your point? What?

15:53.703 --> 15:56.163
Well, if word got out, you'd be ruined, right?

15:56.497 --> 15:59.166
So, as a favor to you,
I'm willing to burn those paintings,

15:59.250 --> 16:02.044
and no one will ever be able to prove
you sold forgeries.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.589
And in exchange, you will say, when asked,

16:05.882 --> 16:09.176
that when you left here,
Owen was despondent, but alive.

16:09.510 --> 16:13.513
Now, can you do that? Or do you not
want me to burn the paintings?

16:17.894 --> 16:19.311
Burn them.

16:34.035 --> 16:40.332
Mr. Carnes!

16:43.878 --> 16:46.505
- Hey! What the hell are you doing?
- We got this, Deputy.

16:46.589 --> 16:49.174
US Marshals Service owns this house now,

16:49.550 --> 16:51.593
so you want to pay us for a new door?

16:52.220 --> 16:53.595
Gentlemen, relax.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.769
Mrs. Carnes, we're here to serve an arrest
warrant on your husband, Owen Carnes.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.771
Finally got your indictment, huh?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.196
Where's your husband, Mrs. Carnes?

17:12.281 --> 17:15.282
I don't know. He never came to bed,
at least not that I'm aware.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.244
I took two sleeping pills.
I barely heard you all driving up.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.455
- When did you last see him?
- 10:00, after David Mortimer left.

17:21.540 --> 17:26.712
Owen was in his den, staring at his Hitlers,
fake Hitlers, whatever they are.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.601
Send in the locals.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.232
Owen!

17:58.661 --> 18:01.329
I don't know what your policy is on suicides.
You're the IRS.

18:01.664 --> 18:04.416
- It might not be a suicide.
- Look, he was going away the rest of his life.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.419
- His creepy paintings were fake.
- Hey, you should hear what this guy said.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.795
Who are you?

18:09.130 --> 18:11.423
I'm with the US Attorney's Office. Go ahead.
Tell him.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.009
I was just saying it might not be a suicide.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.470
Because of the shot in the ceiling?
Happens all the time.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.681
- No, because of the gun in his hand.
- I don't follow you.

18:19.766 --> 18:23.602
When a man shoots himself in the head,
it's like he's a puppet without strings.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.271
He just doesn't hold on to shit.

18:26.355 --> 18:30.317
The gun's usually found around him,
but never in the hand.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.195
- You see that on a CSI?
- Sadly, no.

18:34.947 --> 18:38.366
The one thing we can all agree on is
Carnes is dead and no one here gives a shit.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.453
You want to get local PD to pursue
a homicide, knock yourself out.

18:41.537 --> 18:45.290
As far as the FBI is concerned, the criminal
case is closed. The forfeiture's all yours.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.209
We're out of here in 10.

18:49.504 --> 18:50.879
- You Givens?
- I am.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.297
You shot Tommy Bucks.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.550
Tell me, did you really tell him
he had 24 hours to get out of town

18:55.635 --> 18:58.053
- or you'd shoot him on sight?
- Something like that.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.721
That's fantastic.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.225
I read what Bucks did to
that poor Nicaraguan farmer

19:03.309 --> 19:05.185
with the stick of dynamite. Jesus Christ.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.395
I mean, you must have really wanted
to shoot the guy.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.231
I know I did, and I just read a report.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.525
- You're an AUSA.
- Yep.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.694
You guys still haven't figured out how to
put a dead man on trial yet, huh?

19:15.071 --> 19:16.154
Believe me, we'd love to.

19:16.531 --> 19:19.574
Yank Carnes out of the morgue,
wire him up like Weekend at Bernie's,

19:19.700 --> 19:22.869
get a ventriloquist to speak for him,
"I plead not guilty, Your Honor."

19:23.412 --> 19:25.997
But you got all these negative nancys
always quoting the constitution

19:26.082 --> 19:29.835
- and this goddamn due process bullshit.
- It must be frustrating.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.587
All that work on Carnes for nothing.

19:34.215 --> 19:38.426
No. I'm not on the Carnes case.
David Vasquez.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.930
I'm looking into your shootings.
I'd really like to talk to you.

19:42.056 --> 19:46.268
Obviously, not today, but I'll call you,
set something up.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.272
Bucks pulled first.

19:50.606 --> 19:51.690
Yeah, I read that, too.

20:00.116 --> 20:03.118
- Hanselman Gallery.
- Mr. Hanselman, Deputy Givens.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.788
Calling to arrange
a viewing of my collection?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.290
No, just a quick question.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.126
Police forensics say the ashes
that they pulled

20:11.252 --> 20:14.629
out of Carnes' fireplace showed those
paintings were done with water-based oils.

20:14.964 --> 20:18.300
I don't know what they pulled out of the fire,
but the paintings I examined

20:18.426 --> 20:21.553
were most definitely done
with good, old-fashioned oils, I assure you.

20:21.804 --> 20:22.804
You're sure?

20:22.930 --> 20:25.765
For one thing, Deputy,
water-based oils are quite new.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.060
No self-respecting forger would attempt
to fake a Hitler

20:29.145 --> 20:31.646
with paints that hadn't been invented
when Hitler was painting.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.149
You'd agree that wouldn't be
the smartest move, right?

20:34.734 --> 20:38.236
I suppose you're right. Yeah, thank you.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.739
Don't mention it.
And listen, if you're ever in Cincinnati...

20:40.823 --> 20:42.574
- Hi, Raylan.
- Winona.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.660
- I need a favor.
- I'm sorry?

20:46.454 --> 20:49.581
You said you needed a favor. It's funny.
'Cause the last time I saw you...

20:49.665 --> 20:52.417
- If there was any other way I could do this...
...I said, "I won't come by

20:52.501 --> 20:54.711
"unannounced anymore."
You said, "You won't come by at all."

20:54.795 --> 20:56.421
...you know I would.
- Well, I'm happy to be your course

20:56.505 --> 20:58.757
of last resort. What is it?

20:59.967 --> 21:01.801
I need you to run some names.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.514
Sit down.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.985
Do you know it's against the law for me
to run names for a civilian?

21:19.070 --> 21:20.111
Yes, I know that.

21:20.321 --> 21:23.573
- I got this whole AUSA thing up my ass.
- I know.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.660
What do you mean, you know?
How do you know that?

21:27.870 --> 21:29.245
I can't say.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.374
But it's okay for you to come
and ask me to look up names for you?

21:32.458 --> 21:35.710
Raylan, I would not ask you this
if it wasn't really important.

21:42.218 --> 21:43.969
Hey, thank you.

21:50.601 --> 21:51.643
Raylan.

21:57.525 --> 22:02.362
Did you call the LPD forensics lab asking
about the ashes in Carnes' fireplace?

22:02.488 --> 22:04.864
- I did. Why?
- Their chief just called me.

22:05.366 --> 22:06.449
That was fast.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.953
Yeah, you piss in somebody's sandbox,
they tend to respond rather quickly.

22:10.371 --> 22:14.082
As I explained to the lovely woman
on the phone, the paintings belong to us.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.834
We need to ascertain their disposition.

22:16.627 --> 22:18.628
Murder is not a Marshals matter.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.047
I know that, Art,
but something ain't right here.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.300
Well, just give us 24 hours.

22:24.635 --> 22:25.677
Us?

22:25.886 --> 22:28.221
Tim was gonna bring David Mortimer in
for a little squeeze,

22:28.305 --> 22:30.974
and I was gonna go talk
to the widow Carnes.

22:32.893 --> 22:36.521
If that guy hadn't been such an asshole,
I'd say no, but I'll give you one day.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.691
You don't like rich people, Raylan?

22:39.775 --> 22:41.317
Nobody likes rich people, Art.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.946
- David Mortimer. Thanks for coming.
- My pleasure.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.115
I was told you needed my help.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.576
Yeah, we want you to come up with a list
of all the pieces of art

22:49.660 --> 22:52.495
you helped the Carnes' buy
and how much they paid.

22:53.122 --> 22:55.415
It'll help us when they come to auction.

22:55.875 --> 23:00.670
- I could have done that from my office.
- Sorry. I didn't think of that.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.172
That's all right.

23:03.007 --> 23:05.175
And we want you to include
the Hitler paintings.

23:06.552 --> 23:10.305
Really? I thought Owen burned those
in the fireplace.

23:10.473 --> 23:13.558
It turns out whatever was burned in the
fireplace wasn't one of those paintings.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.186
Really?

23:16.270 --> 23:20.106
We don't know where the paintings are,
but we got a team looking for them.

23:29.825 --> 23:34.162
- Hello, Gary.
- Hello, Raylan. What can I do for you?

23:35.206 --> 23:38.166
Gonna be in Lexington for a while.
I was driving by and saw your sign.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.793
I thought I'd see what was in the market.

23:40.377 --> 23:43.004
- How much is that?
- $725,000.

23:43.297 --> 23:45.840
- I'll keep looking.
- They're motivated to sell.

23:46.258 --> 23:50.095
I doubt there's motivation enough
in the world to get them into my range.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.431
Look, Gary, I want to apologize.

23:53.682 --> 23:57.018
The other night, I came by your house
unannounced and uninvited.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.230
- It's all right.
- No, it's not all right, and I'm sorry.

24:00.314 --> 24:02.148
- It's no big deal.
- Really?

24:04.777 --> 24:06.986
I bumped into Winona the other day
at the courthouse.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.279
She said it really shook you up.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.740
I don't know why she'd say that.

24:10.908 --> 24:11.950
Go figure, huh?

24:14.203 --> 24:17.330
Hey, random question.
Is it "realtor" or "realter"?

24:17.957 --> 24:21.459
I keep hearing these ads on the radio
saying "realtor". I thought it was "realter".

24:21.794 --> 24:24.754
You buy a house in today's market,
you can call us whatever you like.

24:25.089 --> 24:29.092
That'd be nice, huh?
Though, you already got a big house.

24:29.927 --> 24:33.555
Yeah, it's tough times in real estate,
these days, huh?

24:33.931 --> 24:35.348
A lot of pressure. Money's tight.

24:36.058 --> 24:38.351
People must be doing
some desperate things.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.311
You seen any of that?

24:40.980 --> 24:45.984
Any of your colleagues getting into shady
areas, trying to keep their head above water?

24:46.777 --> 24:49.279
I didn't know real estate
was part of the Marshals' purview.

24:50.364 --> 24:51.656
It's not.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.579
Well, I should let you get back to work.
No hard feelings?

24:57.663 --> 25:00.456
- No, none at all.
- All right. And just to tell you,

25:01.792 --> 25:05.253
I wasn't ever thinking of shooting you,
no matter what Winona may have said.

25:07.756 --> 25:12.969
But you drag her down into any of the shit
you've got going on now, different story.

25:20.978 --> 25:22.770
- Where the hell are the paintings?
- They're safe.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.273
- You told me you burned them.
- I changed my mind.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.817
- Why?
- For insurance.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.653
- Insurance against what?
- Against you losing your nerve.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.572
Oh, God.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.325
You're gonna want to sit down, David.
It gets worse.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.035
Why? How?

25:37.203 --> 25:39.537
I want the $150,000 you got
selling Owen the fake Hitlers.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.457
You already got $150,000
from when we did it.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.793
I'm not saying this is fair or right,
but I want your half now.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.171
And if I don't get it,
those paintings will reappear,

25:48.255 --> 25:49.964
and everyone will know you sold fakes.

25:50.257 --> 25:53.009
You'll be lucky to get a job teaching
art history at a community college.

25:53.177 --> 25:56.262
You think I'm a leprechaun or something,
that I got a magic pot of gold somewhere?

25:56.639 --> 25:59.224
You'll figure it out. You're a smart man.

25:59.433 --> 26:01.309
This smart man says,
"What if I go to the police?"

26:01.393 --> 26:03.478
You're what's called a co-conspirator, David.

26:03.646 --> 26:06.689
They won't give you a get-out-of-jail-free
card. You'd still do time.

26:06.982 --> 26:10.568
And when you get out, not even that crappy
little community college would take you.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.955
Deputy Givens, what can I do for you?

26:22.706 --> 26:24.415
You're not gonna offer me a drink?

26:24.541 --> 26:28.086
It's been made repeatedly clear to me all day
this is basically your house now.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.088
You should be offering me a drink.

26:30.464 --> 26:34.175
- What do you want?
- Nothing. Thank you.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.930
Are you gonna go back
to teaching riding again?

26:39.014 --> 26:42.016
I hope so.
It's the only marketable skill I have.

26:42.351 --> 26:46.896
- Where'd you learn to ride?
- Wichita Falls. Do you know where that is?

26:47.564 --> 26:52.652
I do. Yeah. I worked out of
the northern district in Texas for a while.

26:53.570 --> 26:58.116
This little barn, Polestar Farms. There was
a sweet lady there, taught equine therapy.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.661
You and Greg Davis had stables
when you met Owen?

27:01.829 --> 27:04.038
- We did.
- Yeah. You guys gonna partner up again?

27:04.164 --> 27:08.584
I hope so.
As I said, he's a better rider than I am.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.878
I'll probably be working for him now.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.090
I imagine that ain't an easy life,
horse training.

27:14.925 --> 27:17.385
Not that much money, but surrounded by it.

27:17.469 --> 27:23.141
Horses travel by plane while you
drive around a 10-year-old Subaru.

27:25.019 --> 27:27.437
It was a Honda, but, yeah.

27:32.318 --> 27:37.030
I worked a detail a few years back
protecting this very wealthy guy.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.741
He was gonna testify against some
former business partners

27:39.825 --> 27:43.536
and this guy had his own private jet,
and everywhere he went, I went.

27:43.620 --> 27:50.209
I remember, we drove right up to the
plane, like I was in a Bon Jovi video.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.964
The whole thing was catered.
Didn't have to wear a seat belt.

27:55.049 --> 27:57.508
Nobody showed me
any safety demonstration.

27:57.593 --> 28:01.054
The pilot just turned around and said,
"Everybody ready?" And off we went.

28:01.680 --> 28:06.517
As much as I told myself
It wasn't my jet, wasn't my life,

28:08.103 --> 28:13.107
the next time I had to go to a regular airport
and stand in that long security line,

28:13.776 --> 28:18.821
I missed it. So, I know it can be hard.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.532
What can be hard?

28:21.700 --> 28:25.953
The idea of going back and teaching those
rich kids to ride after you've lived like this.

28:26.497 --> 28:31.250
I'll survive. Although, I've changed
my mind about that drink. You?

28:31.543 --> 28:32.627
I'm good.

28:34.797 --> 28:37.006
Hey, who's the artist?

28:39.802 --> 28:41.135
Owen's kids from his first marriage.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.473
- You don't have kids?
- Oh, God, no.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.852
After teaching all those entitled brats,
seeing the way they treated their horses,

28:49.937 --> 28:52.230
it just kind of soured me.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.190
What about you? Do you have kids?

28:55.484 --> 29:01.155
No. Are they grown now, Owen's children?

29:01.407 --> 29:04.409
- Yes.
- Well, maybe they won't miss them.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.036
What?

29:08.288 --> 29:11.374
The ones you burned in place
of your husband's Hitler paintings.

29:14.044 --> 29:15.628
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now.

29:17.381 --> 29:24.053
I'm sorry. I thought you said it was clear.
The US Marshals own this house now.

29:26.140 --> 29:28.975
We're just being nice and letting you stay.

29:36.859 --> 29:40.653
He knows about the paintings. If he came
to see me, he's probably gone to David.

29:41.155 --> 29:42.905
- Caryn, we should just go.
- Where?

29:42.990 --> 29:44.991
I don't know. We're good at what we do.

29:45.075 --> 29:47.368
There's people out there
that have horses that need work.

29:48.245 --> 29:49.495
We wouldn't have any money.

29:49.997 --> 29:53.291
I don't care about money. We got by before.
We'll get by again.

29:53.709 --> 29:57.044
Honey, I wish we could just up and go,
with all my heart.

29:58.589 --> 30:00.173
But we have to deal with David.

30:00.382 --> 30:02.717
- What do you mean?
- I'm gonna call him up.

30:02.885 --> 30:04.218
We'll tell him he can have the paintings,

30:04.303 --> 30:06.137
just bring as much money
as he can get right now.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.431
It's gonna work, baby.

30:12.686 --> 30:14.437
I got to get back to the house.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.884
- You ever married?
- No.

30:45.886 --> 30:51.307
I was just thinking, Mrs. Carnes wasn't too
fond of her husband in the last days.

30:52.267 --> 30:56.562
But can't choose who you fall in love with,
can you?

30:56.855 --> 30:59.565
Guess you can only choose
how far down the road you go with them.

31:00.359 --> 31:04.695
Like my ex-wife, Winona,
I know she loved me when we married,

31:04.780 --> 31:09.700
but somewhere along the road,
she just had enough.

31:09.826 --> 31:10.868
People change.

31:11.078 --> 31:14.455
I don't think I have. Of course, that might
have been part of the problem.

31:15.707 --> 31:19.085
I saw her new husband today, Gary.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.672
Six years ago, when they hooked up,
he thought I might shoot him.

31:22.756 --> 31:27.218
I told him today I was never gonna.
Truth is, I thought about it.

31:28.679 --> 31:32.473
With what I know, how police work,
probably could've gotten away with it, too.

31:33.308 --> 31:37.061
- You want to know why I didn't do it?
- I'm guessing you want me to say I do.

31:38.105 --> 31:40.439
I realized I might have to kill Winona, too,

31:41.316 --> 31:44.277
which, at the time, wasn't that unthinkable.

31:47.406 --> 31:53.828
But then, what if like a neighbor saw?
I'd have to kill him or her, too.

31:55.163 --> 31:59.584
And where would it end? Nowhere good.

32:01.253 --> 32:07.425
Like, suppose right now you had
a gun in your hand, finger on the trigger,

32:07.593 --> 32:09.135
and you had the inclination.

32:09.386 --> 32:13.514
As good as I am, it'd be tough for me to
clear my holster before you put one in me.

32:14.391 --> 32:16.309
Hard to miss at that distance.

32:18.228 --> 32:22.231
But if you did that, where would it end?

32:23.692 --> 32:25.234
I don't know.

32:40.042 --> 32:42.793
- Hello?
- In here.

32:46.340 --> 32:49.842
- Is that the money?
- Yeah. Where are the paintings?

32:51.803 --> 32:54.680
- Come on in.
- Come on.

33:00.187 --> 33:01.979
What are you doing?
You think I'm wearing a wire?

33:05.192 --> 33:06.609
Not now, I don't.

33:08.195 --> 33:11.030
Where are the paintings?
And what's the deal with the...

33:20.415 --> 33:21.666
What are you doing?

33:21.750 --> 33:23.501
I just need to know
how far we're gonna go with this.

33:23.585 --> 33:24.627
What?

33:24.711 --> 33:28.255
If I kill him, is that it? Or are we gonna
have to kill other people, too?

33:28.423 --> 33:29.965
No, we're just gonna take the money and go.

33:30.634 --> 33:31.967
- Where?
- I don't know.

33:32.803 --> 33:36.972
But we've got to try. We already killed Owen.
They can't hang us twice.

33:37.641 --> 33:39.141
Come on, baby, just...

33:42.688 --> 33:44.438
- Is that enough?
- I think so.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.696
I'm sorry.

34:01.540 --> 34:05.960
I couldn't see killing David,
not just 'cause he was in our way.

34:06.670 --> 34:13.175
Owen was a different story.
Met him, started teaching his kids,

34:13.260 --> 34:15.219
and Caryn saw right off he was interested.

34:17.389 --> 34:21.559
She thought he might be the answer
to our prayers,

34:21.643 --> 34:26.230
and I went along with it.
I wanted her to be happy.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.983
The other night, she suggested we kill him.

34:29.359 --> 34:32.277
I went along with that, too,
but not just 'cause I wanted her to be happy.

34:32.362 --> 34:37.158
I had my own reasons.
You have any idea what it feels like?

34:38.368 --> 34:42.413
Every night, she goes up to the big house,
and I stay here in the barn.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.505
It's a real nice place you got here.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.634
It'll do. What can I do for you?

34:55.969 --> 34:58.929
I was just wondering if you were
able to get that information.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.563
Why did you leave me?

35:07.647 --> 35:09.774
You want to talk about that right now?

35:15.071 --> 35:20.743
Okay. I didn't leave you, Raylan. You left me,
when you took that job in Miami.

35:21.119 --> 35:25.206
You were gonna sell the house and join me.
Instead, you ended up banging the realtor.

35:26.583 --> 35:30.711
You think our marriage was a bed of roses
up till I stepped out?

35:31.463 --> 35:34.131
Weren't you just the littlest bit relieved
when I took up with Gary?

35:34.216 --> 35:36.842
- Was it money?
- What?

35:36.927 --> 35:38.761
- Did you want someone who...
- As well as you know me,

35:38.845 --> 35:41.347
do you think I give a shit about money?

35:41.473 --> 35:44.016
Everyone gives a shit about money.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.227
What's going on with you, Raylan?

35:47.562 --> 35:52.441
I want to know. Was he funnier than me?
Smarter? Does he have more money?

35:52.526 --> 35:54.109
A bigger house? A bigger dick?

35:54.236 --> 35:58.864
Yes, no, no, I didn't measure.

35:59.074 --> 36:01.992
Wait. Run the order of that by me again.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.840
I know I played my part.

36:17.968 --> 36:24.682
Losing someone like you, it...
I guess it eats at a guy.

36:29.396 --> 36:30.980
That's the first you've ever said that.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.041
I got the information on those names
you wanted me to run.

36:51.126 --> 36:55.087
I don't know what you were expecting.
I didn't find anything out of the ordinary.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.799
Are you sure?

36:58.884 --> 37:04.221
- I could look a little deeper.
- No. No, that's fine.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.312
Thank you.

37:22.699 --> 37:25.492
Anyway, we just need a written statement
saying they're fakes.

37:26.328 --> 37:27.953
- I can do that.
- Are they?

37:31.249 --> 37:33.042
I don't know.
Maybe you're just saying they're fakes

37:33.126 --> 37:35.210
so you can buy them cheap at auction.

37:37.505 --> 37:40.049
You really don't like me, do you, Deputy?

37:41.468 --> 37:44.470
Whoever painted these
couldn't help himself.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.389
He did a good job with the people.

37:48.058 --> 37:49.141
Hitler never did.

37:50.018 --> 37:52.645
His paintings were all about the buildings
and the streets.

37:53.355 --> 37:58.859
The few people in his paintings
were always very sketchy.

38:07.077 --> 38:09.662
Had any second thoughts about seeing
my collection?

38:09.829 --> 38:15.292
- Oh, no, I'm good.
- I helped you with your case, didn't I?

38:16.795 --> 38:18.796
Then do me this one small favor.

38:26.179 --> 38:27.721
My collection.

38:35.981 --> 38:39.233
My father grew up in Germany,
in Munich, before the war.

38:40.068 --> 38:45.322
He was very poor. He saw the wealthy
of his city, and he wanted what they had.

38:46.324 --> 38:49.326
But there was no way someone like him
could ever hope to rise to that.

38:50.745 --> 38:53.664
And then along came a very charismatic man

38:53.915 --> 38:58.043
who knew who was to blame,
and my father followed him.

39:00.547 --> 39:03.882
Publicly, after the war, my father recanted
everything the Reich stood for.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.386
But he never did in his heart.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.681
In private, after some wine,

39:10.765 --> 39:13.892
he would say that his years working
for Hitler were the best of his life.

39:15.270 --> 39:19.106
His proudest achievement was when Hitler
selected him to run a team

39:19.190 --> 39:23.944
that went through the country,
reacquiring the Fuehrer's old paintings.

39:27.282 --> 39:29.199
I hated my father.

39:32.537 --> 39:33.704
So, this has been my project.

39:35.206 --> 39:39.543
I buy Hitler's shitty paintings,
and I burn them.

39:45.258 --> 39:46.592
Do you understand?

39:56.728 --> 39:58.812
I hope I didn't take you away from anything.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.065
Well, I was this close to bringing a sinner
to Jesus,

40:01.149 --> 40:04.485
and now he is consigned to eternal
damnation. I hope that you're happy.

40:07.489 --> 40:09.406
Did you do as I requested?

40:09.657 --> 40:12.993
Did you take a peek inside the soul
of Raylan Givens?

40:14.162 --> 40:16.288
Or was that not concrete enough for you?

40:16.664 --> 40:21.502
Was it too, what's that word
I'm looking for, nebulous?

40:22.003 --> 40:24.838
I love that word, "nebulous".
It means hard to define.

40:25.590 --> 40:26.924
You know, I'll tell you what,

40:27.675 --> 40:32.012
let's start by you writing down
the five things that you're most proud of,

40:32.097 --> 40:34.640
- and make our way over to the five things...
- Forget it.

40:35.517 --> 40:37.851
Well, I've been doing a lot of writing.
I tell you, it really helps.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.938
No. I mean, I want you to forget about Arlo.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.273
How come, Raylan?

40:45.527 --> 40:47.111
Well, I just...

40:52.951 --> 40:57.871
I met a man who his whole life was crippled.

41:00.834 --> 41:03.127
I'm just gonna let that old dog lie.

41:03.294 --> 41:07.047
That's the very thing that I wanted
to hear you say, Raylan Givens.

41:07.841 --> 41:13.470
In the words of Saint Francis, "It is only by
forgiving that we ourselves are forgiven."

41:16.724 --> 41:18.392
He the one with the birds?

41:19.060 --> 41:21.854
Yes, Raylan. He's the one with the birds.

41:23.898 --> 41:28.652
Let me ask you one more thing.
What if I were to tell you right now,

41:28.820 --> 41:31.530
that I found out something
about your daddy,

41:32.740 --> 41:37.911
something that you could use
to put him away for the rest of his life?

41:38.329 --> 41:40.372
What would you say then?
