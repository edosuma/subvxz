00:04.709 --> 00:05.834
Oh, hey.

00:05.917 --> 00:07.417
You guys wanna hear a joke?

00:07.500 --> 00:08.500
All: No!

00:10.625 --> 00:11.750
Why not?

00:11.834 --> 00:13.542
Because they're never good.

00:13.625 --> 00:15.959
Dad, your mouth is where jokes go to die.

00:17.500 --> 00:18.667
I can be funny.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.375
It's funny watching you try
to tell a joke.

00:22.917 --> 00:24.709
See, now that's funny.

00:26.125 --> 00:28.667
Honey, why don't you just wait
and tell your joke at lunch?

00:28.750 --> 00:30.333
But I have lunch at work.

00:30.417 --> 00:31.458
Uh-huh.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.333
You know what?
You guys are gonna like this one.

00:35.417 --> 00:38.917
So, a guy walks into a store
with a frog on a leash--

00:39.000 --> 00:40.208
Bob: No, no, no!

00:40.291 --> 00:42.500
Sorry. Frog's on his head.

00:43.667 --> 00:46.000
So, anyway, the frog says...

00:47.542 --> 00:49.375
Ah, you shouldn't know the frog talks yet.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.583
So, let's just forget I said that, okay?

00:51.667 --> 00:53.375
The store owner says...

00:53.458 --> 00:55.000
And it doesn't have to be the store owner,

00:55.083 --> 00:57.083
it could just be a guy who works there.

00:57.166 --> 00:58.417
- Okay, okay.
- Or a girl, whatever.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.333
You know what, guys?

00:59.417 --> 01:01.750
In the interest of time,
let's just laugh now and get it over with.

01:01.834 --> 01:03.583
Okay. Go.

01:04.041 --> 01:05.166
Ohh!

01:05.250 --> 01:06.542
- Good one, Dad.
- Bob: No, no, wait.

01:06.625 --> 01:08.166
Wait a minute. I'm not done yet.

01:08.250 --> 01:09.417
- No, but we are.
- Yeah.

01:17.041 --> 01:19.667
Well, you wanna hear the joke,
right, Charlie?

01:19.750 --> 01:21.041
Sure, Daddy.

01:21.125 --> 01:24.083
Okay, so...

01:24.166 --> 01:25.792
Guy walks into a store with a frog--

01:27.041 --> 01:28.709
Wait a minute.

01:28.792 --> 01:31.250
It's not a frog. It's a parrot.

01:33.583 --> 01:34.500
Parrots are funny.

01:34.583 --> 01:35.709
Yeah.

01:35.792 --> 01:38.333
Yeah. Okay. But there's more to the joke.

01:38.417 --> 01:39.709
It doesn't end on "parrot".

01:39.792 --> 01:41.917

02:39.375 --> 02:40.458
What is?

02:40.542 --> 02:43.333
The email from Yale.
I'm about to find out if I got in.

02:43.417 --> 02:45.125
Open it! What are you waiting for?

02:45.208 --> 02:47.000
I can't. I'm too nervous.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.500
Yale is my dream school.

02:48.583 --> 02:52.083
The next ten seconds are gonna decide
the course of my entire life.

02:52.166 --> 02:53.792
Okay. Easy now, honey.

02:54.834 --> 02:56.250
Nobody likes a drama queen.

03:00.083 --> 03:01.500
What are you looking at me for?

03:05.583 --> 03:07.500
Okay. Dad, here, you read it.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.583
I'll be able to tell by your expression.

03:15.083 --> 03:16.166
Uh-oh.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.500
I didn't get in?

03:17.583 --> 03:19.208
No, I sent it to trash.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.583
Hey, how do I get this back?
"Empty trash."

03:23.667 --> 03:24.834
No!

03:25.792 --> 03:27.458
Gosh. I'll do it.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.875
Okay.

03:30.709 --> 03:32.083
Here goes.

03:34.917 --> 03:36.041
Huh?

03:36.417 --> 03:37.917
I'm on the wait list.

03:39.542 --> 03:40.834
Well, that's good.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.709
You still have a chance to get in.

03:42.792 --> 03:44.375
You just have to wait
for a spot to open up.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.458
Well, yeah, but what are the odds of that?

03:46.542 --> 03:48.750
Honey, look, it's out of your hands.

03:49.125 --> 03:52.875
Okay, so until you hear otherwise,
you just have to do what I do.

03:53.041 --> 03:56.291
Just relax and go with the flow.

04:00.625 --> 04:02.208
You're looking at me again.

04:15.417 --> 04:16.667
What is that?

04:16.750 --> 04:18.000
It's a scooter.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.375
Which I bought with my graduation money
from Grandpa.

04:20.458 --> 04:22.709
- You didn't graduate.
- Grandpa doesn't know that.

04:24.083 --> 04:25.583
Gabe, we talked about this.

04:25.667 --> 04:28.000
I specifically said
you could not get one of these things.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.667
You said I couldn't have a dirt bike.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.291
This is an electric scooter.

04:31.375 --> 04:33.375
It's what kids with dirt bikes
make fun of.

04:35.166 --> 04:38.166
Well, whatever it is,
it doesn't look very safe.

04:38.250 --> 04:41.750
Listen, before you decide anything,
how about you just take it for a spin?

04:41.834 --> 04:43.208
Then you can see how tame it is.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.083
Whoo-hoo!

04:45.166 --> 04:47.083
Aww, yeah!

04:47.166 --> 04:48.875
Fun, huh? So can I keep it?

04:48.959 --> 04:51.333
Don't know. Not done testing it yet.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.667
Amy: Whoo-hoo!

04:53.750 --> 04:54.917
Aw, yeah!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.542
Okay, Charlie, let's go.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.041
Hello, Mr. Duncan.

05:04.333 --> 05:05.417
Hello, Teacher Lily.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.417
I wanted to show you something
Charlie wrote about you.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.208
It's on the "Mommy Daddy" wall.

05:09.250 --> 05:10.917
Let me apologize in advance.

05:11.792 --> 05:13.542
No. It's good this time.

05:18.208 --> 05:19.417
Here's Charlie's.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.750
"My daddy tells funny jokes."

05:24.083 --> 05:24.917
My--

05:25.000 --> 05:26.959
Well, at least somebody appreciates me.

05:27.041 --> 05:28.667
Thank you, Charlie.

05:28.750 --> 05:30.166
You're welcome, Daddy.

05:30.917 --> 05:33.542
Since you're coming in for circle time
tomorrow anyway,

05:33.625 --> 05:35.583
how about telling the kids
a couple of jokes?

05:35.667 --> 05:36.792
Oh, I--

05:36.875 --> 05:38.208
I don't know.

05:38.625 --> 05:40.625
Sometimes I get a little rattled.

05:40.709 --> 05:42.583
Mr. Duncan, they're four-year-olds.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.250
You're not hosting the Oscars.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.458
Please, Daddy.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.000
Um...

05:52.250 --> 05:54.375
Well, I guess I could tell a few jokes.

05:54.458 --> 05:56.083
I mean, how hard could that be?

05:56.166 --> 05:57.667
Tell the one about the parrot.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.625
It's so funny.

06:04.917 --> 06:07.417
Oh, hey, Victor,
if you're not busy tomorrow night--

06:07.500 --> 06:09.166
And, uh, I'm assuming you're not--

06:09.250 --> 06:10.250
Hey!

06:12.250 --> 06:14.041
Oh. I'm sorry. Are you busy?

06:14.125 --> 06:15.125
No.

06:16.333 --> 06:17.625
Continue.

06:17.709 --> 06:20.500
Well, I could use some help
with the senior prank.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.125
A prank?

06:22.208 --> 06:24.250
I don't know. That sounds like hijinks.

06:24.375 --> 06:26.000
Which borders on shenanigans.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.250
And from there it's a slippery slope
into tomfoolery.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.458
And you wonder why you're never busy.

06:36.291 --> 06:37.792
Look, I don't wanna get into any trouble.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.792
I have too much at stake.

06:39.875 --> 06:41.959
I was just accepted at Yale.

06:42.291 --> 06:44.583
Hey! Congratulations.

06:44.667 --> 06:46.583
I was just wait-listed there.

06:46.667 --> 06:47.875
They didn't reject you?

06:49.458 --> 06:51.667
Now I feel less good about getting in.

06:52.750 --> 06:53.792
Thanks.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.834
I'm sorry I didn't get in too.

06:58.458 --> 06:59.959
So, uh...

07:00.333 --> 07:01.458
Are you gonna go?

07:01.875 --> 07:03.709
Well, it's between Harvard and Yale.

07:03.792 --> 07:06.041
Well, you are clearly a Harvard man.

07:06.125 --> 07:09.458
I mean, Yale is so "ehh"
and you're so "whoa!"

07:12.125 --> 07:13.834
Teddy, I know what you're doing.

07:13.917 --> 07:16.834
You're trying to talk me out of Yale
so that it opens up a spot for you.

07:16.917 --> 07:18.917
That's good Harvard thinking right there.

07:20.125 --> 07:21.333
It's not gonna work.

07:21.417 --> 07:22.625
Fine.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.333
Well, will you help me
with the senior prank?

07:24.417 --> 07:26.333
Ivy was gonna do it, but she's sick.

07:26.417 --> 07:28.041
Okay. Why not?

07:28.333 --> 07:31.000
But I will not participate
in any malarkey or monkeyshines.

07:32.792 --> 07:34.542
Those are some big words.

07:34.625 --> 07:37.333
I could have also gone with "poppycock"
or "balderdash."

07:38.250 --> 07:40.750
Okay, we get it. You got into Yale.

07:55.333 --> 07:56.542
Going somewhere?

07:58.375 --> 07:59.834
You forgot your lunch.

08:00.959 --> 08:02.000
Got it right here.

08:02.083 --> 08:03.041
You forgot your homework.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.542
I don't do my homework.

08:05.875 --> 08:06.875
Well, you should.

08:06.959 --> 08:09.166
And as punishment,
I'm gonna ride your scooter.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.250
- No, you're not.
- Why?

08:11.875 --> 08:13.583
Why won't you share with me?

08:13.667 --> 08:16.291
Because, Mom,
it's bad enough I have a scooter,

08:16.375 --> 08:18.458
but a scooter that I share with my mom?

08:18.542 --> 08:20.166
I'd beat myself up.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.375
Fine.

08:23.458 --> 08:24.959
I won't ride it anymore.

08:25.041 --> 08:26.250
Good. Thank you.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.917
I can do this all day.

08:52.917 --> 08:55.375
So you're telling jokes
at Charlie's preschool?

08:55.458 --> 08:56.333
Yeah.

08:56.417 --> 08:57.417
Why?

08:57.500 --> 08:59.333
Isn't school hard enough on kids?

09:01.417 --> 09:04.083
Look, I just wanna practice
some jokes on you.

09:04.166 --> 09:05.917
Just pretend you're four years old.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.917
Oh! Okay.

09:08.041 --> 09:09.208
All right...

09:10.959 --> 09:13.875
How do you make a tissue dance?

09:14.667 --> 09:16.834
You blow your nose in it!

09:18.500 --> 09:21.667
I think it goes,
"How do you make a tissue dance?

09:21.750 --> 09:23.500
Put a little boogie in it."

09:24.917 --> 09:26.333
That's what I said.

09:26.417 --> 09:28.625
I may be four,
but that's not what you said.

09:30.208 --> 09:31.542
- Try another one.
- Bob: All right.

09:31.625 --> 09:34.875
Oh! How do you make time fly?

09:34.959 --> 09:37.125
You throw it out the window!

09:38.959 --> 09:40.709
No. No.

09:40.792 --> 09:41.834
No.

09:41.917 --> 09:45.875
To make time fly,
you throw a clock out the window.

09:47.542 --> 09:48.625
That's what I said.

09:48.709 --> 09:50.417
Dad, you're not saying the crucial word.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.333
But I heard it inside my head.

09:54.417 --> 09:56.250
Did you hear me laughing inside your head?

09:57.959 --> 09:59.750
You're pretty harsh for a four-year-old.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.583
Dad, you know what you need?

10:02.667 --> 10:04.000
Cue cards.

10:04.083 --> 10:06.417
Then all you have to do is read the jokes.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.917
But isn't that cheating?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.417
Let me tell you something
my school counselor once told me...

10:12.208 --> 10:13.834
"Cheating is your only hope."

10:20.000 --> 10:21.917
I wonder what Principal Higgins
is gonna say

10:22.000 --> 10:24.083
when he walks in
and sees all this tomorrow.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.667
Probably something like,
"That's a lot of sticky notes."

10:29.458 --> 10:31.333
And it'll all be worth it.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.834
This is really gonna get Ernie's goat.

10:35.917 --> 10:37.250
You call the principal "Ernie"?

10:37.333 --> 10:39.250
Well, he's given me so many awards
over the years,

10:39.333 --> 10:40.834
we've become pretty close.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.750
Ahh! Paper cut.

10:44.834 --> 10:45.959
Ow. Oh!

10:46.041 --> 10:47.375
My mother was right.

10:47.458 --> 10:49.041
Mischief always has repercussions.

10:50.542 --> 10:52.625
Calm down. It's just a little cut.

10:52.709 --> 10:54.625
I need first aid. Did you bring some?

10:54.709 --> 10:57.041
I didn't think it was necessary,

10:57.125 --> 10:59.083
given that we're dealing with paper.

11:00.333 --> 11:01.834
It hurts! Do something!

11:01.917 --> 11:04.041
Okay, fine. I have a bandage in my locker.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.625
I'll be right back.

11:10.208 --> 11:11.208
Hey!

11:12.542 --> 11:13.834
What's going on here?

11:13.917 --> 11:15.000
I can explain.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.417
Let's go.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.709
Where are you taking me?

11:17.792 --> 11:18.917
To the movies.

11:19.000 --> 11:19.834
Oh, thank goodness.

11:19.917 --> 11:21.792
I thought you were taking me to jail.

11:21.875 --> 11:23.917
You have the right to remain silent.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.792
Oh, don't worry.
I never talk during the movies.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.750
Okay, Victor.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.291
Victor?

11:36.166 --> 11:38.125
Maybe he left a note.

11:39.959 --> 11:41.583
This could take a while.

11:53.041 --> 11:54.417
Teddy: There you are! What happened?

11:54.500 --> 11:55.709
Where did you go?

11:55.792 --> 11:57.917
Not to the movies. I'll tell you that.

12:00.375 --> 12:01.959
I got arrested.

12:02.041 --> 12:03.333
- What?
- That's right.

12:03.417 --> 12:06.000
Handcuffed, fingerprinted,
and had my mug shot taken.

12:07.458 --> 12:09.041
You ever been to jail, Teddy?

12:09.125 --> 12:11.125
Super Adventure Land jail.

12:12.959 --> 12:15.333
Denver County Jail is a little different.

12:15.417 --> 12:17.625
It's an adventure, but it's not super!

12:19.917 --> 12:21.917
I have to go see the principal tomorrow.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
If he presses charges,
my college admission could be rescinded.

12:25.834 --> 12:29.000
Rescinded means "taken away"
for those of you on the wait list.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.291
Victor, I'm so sorry.

12:33.375 --> 12:34.458
Are you?

12:34.542 --> 12:36.542
I mean, wasn't this all part
of your big plan?

12:36.625 --> 12:37.875
What are you talking about?

12:37.959 --> 12:39.250
You set me up!

12:39.375 --> 12:41.083
First, you talk me into doing the prank,

12:41.166 --> 12:43.834
then you conveniently disappear
just before the police arrived.

12:43.917 --> 12:45.250
Why would I do that?

12:45.375 --> 12:48.000
So that my arrest
would open up a spot for you at Yale.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.875
Okay, Victor, you're babbling.

12:49.959 --> 12:52.750
How much blood did you lose
from that paper cut?

12:53.458 --> 12:56.166
Not enough to kill me,
if that's what you were hoping for!

13:02.542 --> 13:03.667
Ba-bam!

13:04.166 --> 13:05.375
Oh, what's this?

13:05.458 --> 13:07.083
I got a scooter too.

13:07.166 --> 13:08.667
- Oh, that's great.
- Amy: Yup!

13:08.750 --> 13:10.083
And now we can ride together.

13:10.166 --> 13:11.458
That's not so great.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.959
Mom, let me explain something to you.

13:15.041 --> 13:16.458
I'm in middle school.

13:16.542 --> 13:19.417
I can't be seen riding side-by-side
with my mother.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.625
Look, I bought this
so that we could ride together.

13:22.709 --> 13:24.417
- We're gonna ride together.
- No, we're not.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.709
- Yes, we are.
- No, we're not.

13:25.792 --> 13:27.417
We can go back and forth all night
about this,

13:27.500 --> 13:29.917
but the bottom line is
we're going on a double scoot.

13:32.709 --> 13:33.625
Fine.

13:33.709 --> 13:35.041
But here are the conditions.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.041
We go to a neighborhood
where nobody knows me,

13:37.125 --> 13:38.917
we scoot for no longer than 30 minutes,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.208
and if at any point you tell me
how cute I look,

13:41.291 --> 13:42.500
it's over.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.000
Forty minutes and I get one "cute".

13:45.083 --> 13:47.291
Thirty-five minutes
and you can pinch my cheek.

13:47.375 --> 13:49.000
Deal.

13:59.667 --> 14:03.083
Teddy, we are so proud of you
for graduating from Yale.

14:03.166 --> 14:04.875
Aww. Thanks, Dad.

14:04.959 --> 14:08.166
But, um, why is it just you and Toby here?

14:08.250 --> 14:10.667
Oh, everybody else was busy
in your mom's dream.

14:11.208 --> 14:13.417
Tonight she's starring
in her one-woman Broadway show,

14:13.500 --> 14:14.875
Ba-bamalot.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.458
Hup, food's here.

14:17.542 --> 14:19.625
Oh. I'll get it.

14:23.792 --> 14:25.166
Pizza delivery.

14:27.542 --> 14:28.542
Victor?

14:28.625 --> 14:29.709
Hello, Teddy.

14:29.792 --> 14:30.625
What?

14:30.709 --> 14:31.959
You're delivering pizza now?

14:32.041 --> 14:33.125
Yes.

14:33.291 --> 14:35.458
After my arrest, no college would take me.

14:35.834 --> 14:39.625
So instead of realizing my destiny
of becoming a brilliant scientist,

14:39.709 --> 14:42.000
I work a dead-end job
with no hope for the future.

14:44.375 --> 14:45.792
This is awkward.

14:46.166 --> 14:47.959
We didn't order pepperoni.

14:50.875 --> 14:53.000
My life is a disaster, Teddy.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.792
And it's all your fault.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.375
Fault, fault...

14:56.458 --> 14:57.792
What are you doing?

14:58.792 --> 15:00.250
I thought the dream was over.

15:00.792 --> 15:04.375
No. I get to say when the dream is over...

15:04.458 --> 15:07.458
Over, over, over...

15:15.000 --> 15:17.750
Okay, Dad, showtime.
All you gotta do is read the cards.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.125
Got it.

15:19.542 --> 15:22.166
Okay, children,
we have a real treat for you today.

15:22.250 --> 15:25.583
Let's welcome Charlie's daddy, Mr. Duncan.

15:31.709 --> 15:34.041
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.500
So, anybody here from outta town?

15:40.041 --> 15:41.834
Okay, now for a few jokes.

15:42.458 --> 15:45.250
Why did the chicken cross the road?

15:45.667 --> 15:47.959
To make time fly!

15:52.375 --> 15:54.041
Next joke, next joke.

15:54.333 --> 15:58.709
Uh, what's black and white
and red all over?

16:00.083 --> 16:02.667
To get to the other side.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.458
You know what? They don't get it

16:07.542 --> 16:09.875
because they don't know
what a newspaper is.

16:09.959 --> 16:11.458
You didn't say "newspaper".

16:13.667 --> 16:15.125
Wrap it up.

16:15.583 --> 16:16.625
Um...

16:19.875 --> 16:21.834
Okay, okay, okay, look.

16:21.917 --> 16:25.583
The thing is,
I'm not very good at telling jokes.

16:25.667 --> 16:26.875
We know.

16:29.917 --> 16:31.041
Well...

16:32.166 --> 16:35.250
I guess the truth is
some people just aren't funny.

16:43.041 --> 16:45.500
But I'm not one of those people!

16:49.417 --> 16:50.959
Told you he was funny.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.834
So, what'd you wanna see me about, Ernie?

16:59.917 --> 17:02.875
Uh-uh. "Principal Higgins."

17:03.250 --> 17:05.041
I lost first name privileges?

17:05.583 --> 17:07.041
Are we still on for Jazz Fest?

17:07.125 --> 17:08.875
No, we are not.

17:09.458 --> 17:11.333
Excuse me, Principal Higgins.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.792
Sorry to interrupt.

17:12.875 --> 17:13.917
What is it, Duncan?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.834
Look, the senior prank was my idea.

17:15.917 --> 17:18.959
Victor wanted nothing to do with it,
but I forced him to help me.

17:19.417 --> 17:21.542
So if you're gonna punish anyone...

17:23.542 --> 17:24.667
punish me.

17:25.709 --> 17:26.917
I'm okay with that.

17:29.250 --> 17:32.041
I am very disappointed in both of you.

17:32.417 --> 17:34.333
Two of my best students,

17:34.792 --> 17:36.875
and all you came up with was sticky notes?

17:37.583 --> 17:38.917
That's pathetic!

17:39.917 --> 17:41.333
So you're not going to press charges?

17:41.417 --> 17:43.458
For what? Lack of creativity?

17:44.959 --> 17:46.875
Next time you pull a prank,

17:46.959 --> 17:50.041
put a cow in my office
or glue the furniture to the ceiling.

17:50.125 --> 17:51.375
Something!

17:52.500 --> 17:53.959
Now you're thinking, Ernie.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.083
Stop that.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.667
I gotta take this.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.667
Now, uh, clean all this up.

18:05.625 --> 18:06.917
Thank you, Teddy.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.291
You didn't have to do that.

18:08.542 --> 18:10.500
Victor, as much as I wanna go to Yale,

18:10.583 --> 18:13.500
I would never do anything
to hurt your chances.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.166
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that.

18:15.709 --> 18:17.208
Because I'm accepting their offer.

18:17.250 --> 18:18.667
You should!

18:18.834 --> 18:20.542
Yale is lucky to have you.

18:20.625 --> 18:21.750
Thanks.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.500
And I hope you end up getting in too.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.000
That...

18:26.083 --> 18:28.542
...was the North High principal.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.208
You know what his seniors did to him?

18:31.291 --> 18:34.625
They took apart his car
and reassembled it in his office!

18:35.583 --> 18:36.875
Now that's a prank!

18:38.041 --> 18:40.041
We're sorry, okay?

18:40.125 --> 18:41.333
What am I supposed to tell him?

18:41.417 --> 18:44.166
"Yeah, things are tough over here too.
I got stickied."

18:46.166 --> 18:49.083
We could trash your office if you want.

18:50.208 --> 18:51.583
That's the least you could do.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.959
Whoo! This isn't so bad, is it?

19:03.125 --> 19:04.959
Seventeen minutes and counting.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.875
All right. Stop the clock.

19:08.959 --> 19:10.291
I need to find a bathroom.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.208
Well, well, well.

19:14.709 --> 19:16.125
Gabe Duncan.

19:16.208 --> 19:19.041
Paul, what are you doing
on this side of town?

19:19.125 --> 19:20.625
I get around.

19:20.709 --> 19:24.542
I guess the question is
what are you doing?

19:25.542 --> 19:27.583
Oh, you know, just nothing.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.750
Hanging out.

19:31.125 --> 19:32.375
By myself.

19:32.792 --> 19:34.542
Hey, wanna see a cute pic?

19:36.166 --> 19:38.375
It's you and your mommy scooting together.

19:39.875 --> 19:43.625
You know, I think that a lot of people
would like to see this.

19:43.709 --> 19:46.083
Oh, okay,
let's just calm down for a second.

19:46.166 --> 19:47.709
"Post album."

19:48.208 --> 19:49.500
Should I?

19:51.125 --> 19:52.709
No, no, no.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.500
What do you want, Paul?

19:54.583 --> 19:55.917
I'm tired of walking.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.500
I could use a little transpo.

19:57.583 --> 19:58.458
Oh, please take it.

19:58.542 --> 20:00.333
This thing has brought me
nothing but trouble.

20:01.792 --> 20:04.166
- Nice doing business with you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.166
Delete it first.

20:06.959 --> 20:08.208
Now get outta here.

20:12.834 --> 20:14.000
What happened to your scooter?

20:14.083 --> 20:15.000
I traded it.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.125
For what?

20:16.208 --> 20:17.500
My reputation.

20:20.709 --> 20:21.959
I'll explain later.

20:22.041 --> 20:23.834
- Need a ride home?
- Yeah.

20:23.917 --> 20:25.333
- Hop on.
- Gabe: All right.

20:28.333 --> 20:29.959
Okay, hold on tight, sweetie.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.917
Zoe: And smile.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.542
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh!

20:42.625 --> 20:43.875
What, what? What is it?

20:43.959 --> 20:45.542
It's another e-mail from Yale.

20:45.625 --> 20:46.750
Oh, you want me to--

20:46.834 --> 20:47.792
No!

20:51.166 --> 20:52.500
Mom, you do it.

20:52.583 --> 20:54.000
Okay.

20:56.917 --> 20:58.000
You got in.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.083
I got in?

20:59.166 --> 21:00.542
You got in.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.875
Oh, man! We...

21:09.959 --> 21:11.875
We are so proud of you!

21:11.959 --> 21:13.333
I'm so proud of me too.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.166
What about me?

21:18.125 --> 21:20.166
I'm gonna be the mother of a Yalie.

21:22.625 --> 21:24.083
You're looking at me again.

21:24.166 --> 21:25.458
No, I didn't--

21:25.542 --> 21:27.333
- Hey!
- Amy: Yeah!

21:33.542 --> 21:37.333
Well, Charlie, I got into Yale.

21:37.375 --> 21:40.041
You know, there's actually
a lot of famous people that went there.

21:40.125 --> 21:44.250
Several U.S. presidents,
Supreme Court justices,

21:44.375 --> 21:47.000
and the Circle Gurgle.

21:48.917 --> 21:51.834
Yep, soon I will be joining
that proud lineup.

21:53.208 --> 21:55.834
Whee! Hey, Gabe!

21:56.250 --> 21:58.250
I got your scooter back.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.208
- What?
- Yeah.

22:00.291 --> 22:01.917
Big brother to the rescue.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.166
Saw that punk and just took it from him.

22:05.041 --> 22:06.125
Yeah.

22:06.208 --> 22:08.083
He was not happy about it.

22:08.834 --> 22:10.959
Yeah, thank you,

22:11.041 --> 22:12.792
but there's just one problem.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.000
That's not my scooter.

22:16.875 --> 22:18.333
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

22:19.542 --> 22:21.250
Whee!

22:22.583 --> 22:24.250
Wish him good luck, Charlie.

22:35.333 --> 22:36.458
Bob: There she is.

22:36.542 --> 22:37.834
The toast of Broadway.

22:37.917 --> 22:39.875
You were magnificent tonight.

22:39.959 --> 22:40.959
Great, listen,

22:41.041 --> 22:42.792
I'm gonna need you both in my dream
tomorrow night.

22:42.875 --> 22:45.959
Mm, no can do, Mom.
I gotta be in Gabe's dream tomorrow night.

22:46.041 --> 22:48.875
He's getting chased by monsters
and I do not wanna miss that.

22:48.959 --> 22:50.500
And I have to be in my own dream.

22:50.583 --> 22:52.750
I'm giving a book report
in front of my second-grade class

22:52.834 --> 22:55.083
- in my underwear.
- Hey, hey, hey!

22:55.166 --> 22:57.458
Let's bring this back to me, okay?
This is my dream.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.250
Where is Gabe anyway?

22:59.333 --> 23:01.041
Sorry we're late.

23:01.125 --> 23:03.083
Mrs. Dabney was having
that nightmare again.

23:03.166 --> 23:04.333
We?

23:08.834 --> 23:10.417
How many of you are there?

23:10.500 --> 23:11.625
Three thousand.

23:12.583 --> 23:13.834
She had tacos.
