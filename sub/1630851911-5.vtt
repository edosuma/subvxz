BASED ON AN UNSOLVED CRIME

00:34.880 --> 00:36.000
THE MOZART BROTHERS

00:53.440 --> 00:56.760
THE MOZART BROTHERS
12:30, 3:30, 4:30, 7, 9:15

01:35.920 --> 01:36.960
Are you full?

01:58.600 --> 02:02.520
Papa-Zulu-Zulu-four-three-six.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.480
Hello.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.280
Stig Engström?

02:39.320 --> 02:40.440
Are you Stig Engström?

02:41.840 --> 02:43.040
Yes.

02:43.120 --> 02:46.040
I… I have… I'll just…

03:12.320 --> 03:14.280
Haven't you eaten anything, Stig?

03:17.160 --> 03:18.920
Did you sleep at all?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
No.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.080
You look a bit better today.

03:25.880 --> 03:29.360
It's been five days since your last drink,
so you'll feel better soon.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.840
Hi.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.760
Did you wait long?

03:56.080 --> 03:59.040
-An hour maybe.
-Why didn't you come inside?

04:00.800 --> 04:04.640
-Because I didn't want to.
-Okay. It'll be nice to get home.

04:05.600 --> 04:09.640
-Any trouble finding the place?
-It's the second time I picked you up.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.280
-I was just…
-There won't be a third.

04:12.360 --> 04:13.560
No.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.000
I mean it. This is the last time.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.720
It's out of the question
that it'll happen again.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.640
I can assure you.

04:27.560 --> 04:28.400
Good.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.920
So, Stig,

04:38.680 --> 04:40.080
what brings you here?

04:40.960 --> 04:43.720
Well, if I knew.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.040
It wasn't my decision.

04:49.040 --> 04:53.000
-What happened that night?
-It should say in your papers.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.120
But in your own words?

04:55.200 --> 04:59.080
I find it pointless to answer questions
you know the answer to.

05:00.280 --> 05:02.640
You were arrested for extreme DUI.

05:03.240 --> 05:06.080
Extreme? Well, that can be debated.

05:06.160 --> 05:11.000
You have to leave breath samples
three times a week, and you are to…

05:11.080 --> 05:13.080
Walk around wearing this thing.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.920
Yes.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.120
And speak to me.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.440
I'm afraid I'm going to
be a pretty thankless task.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.360
Is that so?

05:24.960 --> 05:26.040
How so?

05:26.120 --> 05:28.360
I have respect for your profession,

05:28.440 --> 05:33.440
and I'm sure you want
to solve everybody's problems,

05:33.520 --> 05:35.000
but mine have been solved.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.160
What do you mean?

05:37.240 --> 05:39.880
I mean that this incident was caused by…

05:40.440 --> 05:44.560
certain financial problems,
but they have been solved, so…

05:45.280 --> 05:46.840
all's well that ends well.

05:47.760 --> 05:48.800
Yet here we are.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.080
Yes.

05:52.480 --> 05:56.680
It's going to be
an odd little social game.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.240
Why don't you tell me who you are.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.120
I'd… I'd be happy to.

06:09.760 --> 06:14.240
I'm a part of contemporary history.
That's something to tell the grandkids.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.400
-We're bound by confidentiality.
-That's too bad.

06:19.840 --> 06:23.120
-What do you know about the Palme murder?
-Well…

06:23.680 --> 06:25.360
No, you're way too young.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.200
But…

06:28.280 --> 06:31.200
I was the key witness in the Palme trial.

06:31.960 --> 06:35.720
-He basically died in my arms.
-That sounds very traumatizing.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.640
Yes.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.640
I also took care of Lisbeth Palme.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.120
She was terribly shaken.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.080
But she described the murderer to me.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.320
So I guided
the police officers in pursuit.

06:56.200 --> 07:00.360
Many think that I'm the only one
who escaped with their honor intact.

07:02.440 --> 07:06.280
I called Margareta Engström
to ask about Harry Levin.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.760
She didn't remember anything,

07:08.840 --> 07:12.080
but the investigators
have started asking her questions.

07:12.160 --> 07:17.640
It can only mean that they've also taken
an interest in Levin's gun collection.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.160
So how did Stig
get the gun from the collection?

07:23.240 --> 07:26.000
Did he steal it,
or did Levin lend it to him?

07:26.520 --> 07:29.720
Everyone who knows
is either dead or senile.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.760
But it must've come
from Levin's collection?

07:33.840 --> 07:38.120
Yes, Stig probably brought the gun
to Skandia and kept it in his office.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.400
We know that he sometimes
ran into Palme near Skandia.

07:42.400 --> 07:47.360
He probably wanted to have the gun nearby,
in case the opportunity arose.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.200
Okay, let's say Stig had a gun.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.040
And then he saw Palme.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.480
He might have fantasized about the moment,

07:58.560 --> 08:00.840
but to shoot, huh?

08:00.920 --> 08:05.440
To point the gun at another human being
and pull the trigger…

08:05.520 --> 08:07.680
-I've had the same thought.
-Yes?

08:07.760 --> 08:12.120
That's why I started to look for something
that could answer the question…

08:12.200 --> 08:16.120
Did he have experience?
I found something from Stig's first job.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.480
-The Army Ordnance Administration?
-Yes.

08:20.520 --> 08:24.640
They had a shooting club.
I mean, this was serious stuff.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.640
If you were a member,
you shot guns, you competed.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.600
And Stig was a member.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.160
So he definitely knew how to shoot.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.640
In that case, we should print your book.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.760
I thought you didn't want
conspiracy theories.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.000
I don't.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.000
You know how he got the gun,

08:49.720 --> 08:51.720
that he could handle a gun,

08:52.360 --> 08:55.680
and how the murder went down.
This isn't another theory.

08:56.680 --> 08:57.560
This is the solution.

09:01.480 --> 09:08.400
"I WAS MISTAKEN FOR THE MURDERER"

09:09.600 --> 09:15.040
FEBRUARY 28, 1986 - 9:11 P.M.

11:02.160 --> 11:07.200
I'll put the everyday things here
so they're easy for you to reach, okay?

11:08.760 --> 11:11.120
I don't care what you do with that china.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.160
-And this? It was a 40th birthday gift.
-Throw it away.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.680
I've divided up
the silverware in two, because…

11:36.040 --> 11:37.920
Stop it, Stig.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.920
It's a cozy apartment.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.280
In a nice neighborhood.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.440
It's almost been a month.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.080
-And your drawing board?
-No.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.760
-When is this going to stop?
-That's up to you.

11:56.840 --> 12:00.040
I'm not accepting this pseudo-life
in this rat's nest.

12:00.640 --> 12:05.000
-I'm not going to sign those papers.
-The divorce will go through anyway.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.640
Please. Stig.

12:11.400 --> 12:15.120
-This is how it's going to be.
-You… You'll change your mind.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.800
I know you.
We'll have done all this for nothing.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.440
We look ridiculous.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.360
It's exquisite!

12:47.240 --> 12:50.440
-Is it real ivory?
-Of course.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.960
-And the black pieces?
-Ebony.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.520
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.320
It must've cost a fortune.

12:58.840 --> 12:59.880
Not in India.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.120
You have no idea. Nothing costs anything.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.680
For a European in India,
life is extremely comfortable.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.600
Stig, what do you think about India?

13:09.680 --> 13:11.600
I like it. It's warm.

13:11.680 --> 13:12.680
Unlike here.

13:13.280 --> 13:16.720
Are you really staying at a hotel?
We have plenty of beds.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.680
No, thank you. We have an early train.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.920
The room's booked.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.200
But why?

13:27.920 --> 13:30.200
We want you to become a Swedish boy.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.640
You're a Swedish boy.
Sweden is your country.

13:35.160 --> 13:36.360
Where will I live?

13:37.400 --> 13:38.440
Here.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.520
With Aunt Siv and Uncle Erik.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.240
They're already really fond of you.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.080
Before you know it,
we'll come to visit you.

13:55.040 --> 13:58.640
We'll send loads of letters
and postcards to each other.

14:00.320 --> 14:03.280
In a few years,
your little brother will move here.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.040
Make us proud.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.360
I didn't ask for this.

14:25.080 --> 14:28.760
I've held my head high.
I've stood by my principles, but they…

14:29.480 --> 14:33.400
They did everything to break me,
both physically and mentally.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.040
-Physically?
-Sure.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.440
-In what way?
-Look at me. I was an elite athlete.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.480
I was school champion. Now I'm arthritic.

14:44.880 --> 14:50.600
I drag my leg behind me because that
damn idiot gave me the wrong treatment.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.000
-A doctor?
-A dentist.

14:53.760 --> 14:57.600
It was 30 years ago.
Thirty years of constant pain.

14:59.280 --> 15:03.000
-It sounded like there were several.
-There were many.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.320
Spiteful colleagues.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.480
False friends.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.920
The sadists at Sigtuna,
they all got what they wanted.

15:13.800 --> 15:17.280
-You feel let down.
-Yes, I was let down, betrayed.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.080
It must be a burden.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.120
Yeah.

15:26.760 --> 15:30.280
Is there anything that you
could have done differently?

15:32.320 --> 15:33.920
Anything that torments you?

15:35.920 --> 15:37.120
Anything you regret?

15:46.120 --> 15:47.160
Yes.

15:51.880 --> 15:52.920
That…

15:54.200 --> 15:55.240
That night…

16:01.200 --> 16:02.240
I…

16:05.440 --> 16:07.280
I wanted to do the right thing.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.200
Make things right.

16:13.720 --> 16:14.760
How?

16:21.720 --> 16:23.920
What do you regret, Stig?

16:31.960 --> 16:33.000
That I…

16:43.480 --> 16:44.840
That I didn't speak up.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.600
That I let those idiots
waste valuable time.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.760
That I didn't tell that
police officer off. It's…

16:55.360 --> 16:57.160
It's too late to change that.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.480
Well, I guess that means…

17:04.480 --> 17:05.520
that we're done.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.560
Our next guest is journalist Sven Anér.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.600
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

17:15.680 --> 17:19.600
You've just released a book,
Cover-up: The Palme Murder,

17:19.680 --> 17:25.320
where you claim that there are suspicious
circumstances concerning the Palme murder.

17:25.400 --> 17:30.560
Things the police haven't investigated,
and the authorities have helped cover up.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.880
That's right.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.880
Can you give us an example?

17:33.960 --> 17:38.920
Yes, the strangest thing
is the so-called "Skandia Man."

17:39.000 --> 17:43.280
There are many unanswered questions
regarding his role at the scene.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.640
He has lied about
what he was doing from the start,

17:46.720 --> 17:49.520
both to the police and us journalists.

17:49.600 --> 17:54.000
We know that he was close to the scene
when the murder was committed,

17:54.080 --> 17:57.360
but everything else
that he has said is a lie.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.880
All the witnesses deny seeing him,

18:00.960 --> 18:04.120
but the police refuse to confront him.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.520
Why?

18:05.600 --> 18:08.440
-Stig.
-Hi, Leif Stenberg from Expressen.

18:08.960 --> 18:13.080
Sven Anér is being interviewed
about his book on the Palme murder.

18:13.800 --> 18:18.040
He says that you're lying about
your role in the murder. Care to comment?

18:19.960 --> 18:23.040
-What?
-How do you respond to Anér's allegations?

18:23.120 --> 18:25.320
Why are they letting him slip away?

18:25.400 --> 18:27.440
Stig Engström probably…

18:27.520 --> 18:28.560
Hello?

18:29.440 --> 18:30.560
Stig?

18:30.640 --> 18:36.160
So my appeal to the Swedish police
is to immediately question Stig Eng--

18:48.520 --> 18:49.560
Hell.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.800
-Hi, Stig.
-Hi.

19:24.120 --> 19:27.440
How are you? Come in and sit down.

19:30.320 --> 19:31.360
Yes…

19:35.160 --> 19:37.080
It's… my heart.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.080
Did something happen?

19:40.160 --> 19:42.840
Why can't they just leave me alone?

19:43.520 --> 19:44.360
Who?

19:44.960 --> 19:48.840
-Is it the journalists?
-Yes, I… I can't take it.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.200
I'll get some water.

19:59.800 --> 20:00.840
Hi, Stig.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.080
Do you need help?

20:08.320 --> 20:10.520
You aren't dying, are you?

20:57.560 --> 20:58.600
Engström.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.400
Hi, Petronella. How sweet.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.360
No, it's…

21:05.960 --> 21:07.000
I'm fine.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.840
Things are better than ever.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.560
Yes, that's right. We…

21:12.640 --> 21:16.520
We went our separate ways,
but yeah, I thought it was time.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.320
Yeah, I'm making a fresh start.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.400
You only get one life, so I…

21:23.920 --> 21:25.280
I've stared cycling.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.600
I bought one
of those monsters with 24 gears.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.400
Yes, at least ten kilometers a day.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.320
No, I… It…

21:38.480 --> 21:42.240
No, that's… that's all over.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.400
I haven't… I haven't had a drink in…

21:46.480 --> 21:49.040
Well, three weeks.

21:50.600 --> 21:51.600
Yes.

21:52.760 --> 21:53.800
Yes, do that.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.560
You're most welcome.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.960
Yes. Goodbye. Bye.

22:07.680 --> 22:13.480
FEBRUARY 28, 1986 - 10:19 P.M.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.360
The investigator in charge…

24:17.440 --> 24:20.760
Sorry, I have to go.
Can I call you back? Bye.

24:20.840 --> 24:24.720
We're working on one
particularly interesting lead.

24:25.240 --> 24:29.080
My goal is to present a decision
within a few months.

24:29.160 --> 24:33.040
-So you're closer to a solution?
-Yes.

24:33.720 --> 24:38.040
We'll be able to present what happened
on February 28, 1986.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.600
What do you mean?

24:39.680 --> 24:43.960
We'll hold a press conference
where we'll reveal who murdered Palme.

24:57.400 --> 24:58.720
Margareta Engström.

24:59.480 --> 25:03.400
Hi, Margareta.
Maria Johansson from the Palme unit here.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.400
Yes, hello.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.800
I've got Krister Petersson here.

25:08.880 --> 25:12.800
He's a prosecutor
and head of the Palme unit.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.040
-Hello, Margareta.
-Hello.

25:15.960 --> 25:19.080
We have some more
questions we'd like to ask you.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.760
Sure, that's fine.

25:22.280 --> 25:27.240
The day after the Palme murder,
you and Stig were supposed to go to Idre.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.240
Yes, but…

25:31.240 --> 25:34.120
we went later
because of all the commotion.

25:35.160 --> 25:40.080
What do you remember about the trip?
Did anything out of the ordinary happen?

25:43.080 --> 25:44.800
No, it…

25:45.640 --> 25:47.200
We went skiing, and…

25:49.280 --> 25:50.600
things were normal.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.720
Do you remember if any calls were made?

25:55.280 --> 25:56.360
No…

25:56.880 --> 26:01.680
The thing is, on the evening of March 5th,
while you were in Idre,

26:01.760 --> 26:07.080
the police received two identical
anonymous tips, ten minutes apart.

26:07.160 --> 26:13.640
These tips concerned a large man
with a semi-long, dark coat seen running

26:14.240 --> 26:20.240
about where the murderer disappeared.
He jumped into a blue Opel and drove off.

26:23.360 --> 26:26.920
-Are you still there?
-Yes, I'm still here.

26:27.760 --> 26:32.400
This man had a wrist bag, just like Stig.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.040
If the tips turned out to be true,
it would have given Stig an alibi.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.800
Another man fitting the same description,
leaving in an Opel.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.160
A moment later,

26:43.240 --> 26:47.840
someone called the on-duty priest
and said the exact same thing,

26:47.920 --> 26:50.760
and demanded
that he pass it on to the police.

26:52.040 --> 26:55.160
It almost sounds
as if someone tried to help Stig.

26:57.920 --> 26:58.960
Hello?

26:59.720 --> 27:00.760
I'm listening.

27:01.440 --> 27:04.400
Two of the tips were called in by a woman.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.440
We don't know about the third.

27:06.520 --> 27:10.520
We're wondering
if it was you who made these calls.

27:22.400 --> 27:23.560
No, it wasn't.

27:25.360 --> 27:26.400
Are we done?

27:31.800 --> 27:33.040
Hey, stop!

27:34.400 --> 27:36.920
Stop! Can you stop?

27:37.720 --> 27:40.440
You have to pay the bill. Stop!

27:44.000 --> 27:45.360
You have to pay, my friend.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.880
-Yes…
-You have to pay the bill.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.280
Sorry… Sorry, I…

27:50.360 --> 27:53.040
Six beers, one Jägermeister,
and one pizza.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.360
That's 423 kronor.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.320
Yes…

28:04.200 --> 28:07.800
Is that all? Let me see.
Is that all you have, 250 kronor?

28:07.880 --> 28:13.760
-Are you trying to screw me? Your card.
-I, unfortunately-- I don't have a card.

28:13.840 --> 28:16.480
Screw this. Beat it, you goddamn drunk.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.120
Don't call me a drunk!

28:50.960 --> 28:52.000
This is Anna.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.480
Hi, Anna. It's… It's Stig.

28:58.480 --> 28:59.640
Sorry, Stig who?

29:01.120 --> 29:02.240
Stig Engström.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.200
Right. Hi, Stig.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.400
Sorry, you sounded different.

29:12.320 --> 29:15.960
Thank you for the poems you sent me.
They were very sad.

29:16.560 --> 29:17.680
Did you write them?

29:19.280 --> 29:20.320
Yes.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.000
Did you have anything on your mind?

29:29.240 --> 29:30.280
I…

29:31.600 --> 29:36.480
Do you remember
when I ran into you and your son Rickard?

29:41.400 --> 29:42.440
Yes.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.560
If… If we had…

29:46.320 --> 29:50.560
If we still had been married,
and he'd been my son, do you think that…

29:52.280 --> 29:54.280
I'd have been a good father?

29:56.600 --> 29:59.960
Yes, I'm sure you would've been, but…

30:01.480 --> 30:04.280
Did you know that I'm the Skandia Man?

30:05.920 --> 30:07.040
No, what's that?

30:10.280 --> 30:12.800
What do you know about the Palme murder?

30:12.880 --> 30:16.960
I'm sorry, but I have to go. Take care.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.960
Hello? Stig?

30:37.520 --> 30:39.240
Huh? What…? Who is it?

30:41.320 --> 30:42.360
Petronella.

30:42.920 --> 30:45.080
-The door was open.
-No.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.240
I don't want to… Just go.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.800
Stig, how are you?

30:52.880 --> 30:54.800
Please, just go.

31:01.080 --> 31:02.200
Let me help you.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.840
-Let me clean up.
-Leave!

31:04.920 --> 31:05.840
Okay.

31:12.240 --> 31:13.400
You were so close.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.480
That night, you were so close…

31:22.400 --> 31:23.440
to saving me.

31:30.440 --> 31:31.520
You were so close.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.680
Me and Uncle Erik
are sleeping in the next room.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.320
You know where the outhouse is.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.960
You also have a pot under your bed.

32:06.520 --> 32:09.080
-Good night, Stig.
-Good night.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.920
Hi, Stig. It's Petronella.

32:50.920 --> 32:54.800
I came by a while ago,
but no one answered the door.

32:55.760 --> 32:56.800
Hey…

32:57.560 --> 33:00.360
I've been thinking about what you said…

33:01.160 --> 33:04.280
about me almost saving you.

33:05.560 --> 33:08.200
I've been thinking, and I…

33:09.120 --> 33:11.640
I might understand what you…

33:12.480 --> 33:13.520
what you mean.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.560
I'd rather not say more here, but…

33:17.640 --> 33:20.840
but please, call me back when you can.

33:22.120 --> 33:23.160
Okay?

33:23.800 --> 33:24.840
Bye.

34:21.360 --> 34:25.640
-A good movie, I'd say.
-Yes, it was exciting.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.560
-No, but…
-Hey, Petronella.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.120
What did he do?

35:26.200 --> 35:30.640
He was pointing or something,
and it came out wrong.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.360
I was thinking about it too.

35:33.600 --> 35:38.080
And when he started pointing…
I didn't get that, because I thought…

35:39.040 --> 35:41.760
At least check your calendars.

35:58.560 --> 35:59.400
Good morning.

35:59.440 --> 36:00.680
JUNE 10, 2020

36:00.760 --> 36:03.440
We will now present our indictment

36:04.120 --> 36:09.240
and what conclusions we've reached
in regard to the murder of Olof Palme.

36:11.400 --> 36:15.640
With regards to this investigation,
we've come as far as can be expected.

36:16.960 --> 36:20.160
There's one suspect that we can't ignore.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.360
That person is Stig Engström,

36:25.240 --> 36:27.240
often called the Skandia Man.

36:29.320 --> 36:34.120
Since Stig Engström is deceased,
he can't be prosecuted.

36:35.240 --> 36:38.520
I've decided to end
the preliminary investigation

36:38.600 --> 36:41.920
on the grounds that
the suspect is deceased.

36:42.520 --> 36:45.840
One important aspect
is what happened earlier that night.

36:45.920 --> 36:52.440
During questioning, Stig Engström denied
leaving his workplace before clocking out.

36:52.520 --> 36:55.640
But because
of the security guard's statements,

36:55.720 --> 36:59.040
we know that he went out for dinner
earlier that night,

37:00.160 --> 37:02.080
and therefore was out…

37:11.960 --> 37:14.160
There's a clothing store
across the street.

37:40.320 --> 37:41.960
-Well, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.240
-Sleep well.
-Thank you.

38:59.880 --> 39:00.920
Olof.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.080
-No…
-Olof!

39:17.360 --> 39:19.840
Olof!

39:55.840 --> 39:58.480
Sweden's Prime Minister
Olof Palme is dead.

39:59.280 --> 40:05.000
He was shot tonight in central Stockholm.
He was shot on Tunnelgatan/Sveavägen.

40:05.080 --> 40:09.680
He died later in Sabbatsberg Hospital,
the government has confirmed.

40:09.760 --> 40:14.480
Minister of Finance Kjell-Olof Feldt
and Vice Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson

40:14.560 --> 40:17.560
have both been informed
that Olof Palme is deceased.

40:17.640 --> 40:21.680
A citywide search is ongoing in Stockholm.

40:21.760 --> 40:24.480
The reservation office
sent out a description.

40:24.560 --> 40:30.200
According to the police, a taxi driver
observed that a person had been shot.

40:30.280 --> 40:33.920
He alerted the reservation office,
who alerted the police.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.360
The control room
sent a police van to the scene.

40:37.440 --> 40:43.120
Olof Palme was shot at 11:30 p.m.,
an hour and a half ago.

40:43.200 --> 40:46.400
The government
has convened an emergency meeting.

40:46.480 --> 40:49.040
Ingvar Carlsson, Vice Prime Minister…

40:56.040 --> 40:58.880
Based on the book The Unlikely Murderer
by Thomas Pettersson.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.680
It has not been proved
that Stig Engström murdered Olof Palme,

41:01.760 --> 41:04.200
but the Swedish police
and Prosecution Authority suspect him.
