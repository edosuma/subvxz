00:00.083 --> 00:01.458
[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Lost...

00:01.542 --> 00:02.375
Goodbye, John.

00:02.458 --> 00:05.083
You're gonna have to lie.
It's the only way to protect it.

00:05.166 --> 00:08.583
It's an island, John.
No one needs to protect it.

00:08.667 --> 00:10.125
It's a place where miracles happen.

00:10.208 --> 00:11.959
There's no such thing as miracles.

00:12.041 --> 00:15.125
We gotta get every ounce of
extra weight off this chopper now!

00:15.208 --> 00:17.166
Anything not bolted down toss it out!

00:18.333 --> 00:19.208
Sawyer!

00:20.166 --> 00:22.417
[Desmond] <i>There's enough C4 here</i>
<i>to blow up a bloody aircraft carrier.</i>

00:22.542 --> 00:25.291
This is a radio receiver.
It triggers the bomb remotely.

00:25.375 --> 00:28.083
I took out a bit of a life insurance
policy, Ben.

00:28.166 --> 00:29.542
You killed my daughter.

00:32.417 --> 00:35.375
-You just killed everybody on that boat.
-So?

00:48.458 --> 00:51.250
Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry to bother you.
Do you have the time, please?

00:51.625 --> 00:53.417
Yeah. It's 8.15--

01:29.875 --> 01:31.917
-Sayid?
-Hello, Hurley.

01:36.583 --> 01:39.834
-I think visiting hours are over, dude.
-This isn't a visit.

01:41.333 --> 01:42.750
I want you to come with me.

01:44.041 --> 01:46.208
-Come with you where?
-Somewhere safe.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.500
Now why would I go anywhere with you?

01:49.208 --> 01:50.834
I haven't seen you in, like, forever.

01:51.917 --> 01:53.709
Because circumstances have changed.

01:54.834 --> 01:56.333
What circumstances?

01:57.375 --> 01:58.542
Bentham's dead.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.500
-What?
-Two days ago.

02:06.208 --> 02:08.875
-What happened?
-They said it was suicide.

02:08.959 --> 02:10.792
What do you mean they said it was suicide?

02:12.125 --> 02:13.208
And why do you call him Bentham?

02:13.834 --> 02:15.041
-His name is--
-Don't say it.

02:19.500 --> 02:20.792
We're being watched.

02:21.625 --> 02:25.875
Dude, I've been having regular
conversations with dead people.

02:27.083 --> 02:29.083
The last thing I need now is paranoia.

02:29.583 --> 02:33.125
I just killed a man who's been perched
outside this facility for the last week.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.208
I'm finding paranoia keeps me alive.

02:41.917 --> 02:43.291
We're not going back, are we?

02:44.291 --> 02:45.125
No.

02:45.959 --> 02:47.250
Just somewhere safe.

02:52.709 --> 02:53.625
OK, then.

02:57.458 --> 02:58.417
Hold on a sec.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.417
Checkmate, Mr. Eko.

03:18.959 --> 03:22.000
-Where's the freighter?
-I don't know. I stayed on course.

03:22.458 --> 03:23.875
They must have it on the move again.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.250
How much fuel?

03:29.792 --> 03:32.959
Four, five minutes' worth,
unless somebody else wants to jump.

03:40.625 --> 03:43.041
Soon as we get to the boat
we'll go back for him.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.083
Hey!

03:46.083 --> 03:48.834
There it is, the boat! I see it!
It's behind us!

04:12.125 --> 04:15.834
Ben, help me. If he dies,
everybody on that boat dies.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.667
It's not my problem, John.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.542
Hang on, man. Hang on!

04:25.667 --> 04:26.875
Wherever you go

04:31.166 --> 04:32.291
Widmore,

04:36.250 --> 04:37.375
he'll find you.

04:41.667 --> 04:43.834
Not if I find him first.

04:48.625 --> 04:50.458
Hey, no, no. Hey! Hey!

04:50.917 --> 04:51.834
Hey!

05:03.208 --> 05:04.500
You two need to go now.

05:04.583 --> 05:05.792
Get everybody off the boat.

05:06.250 --> 05:08.458
We have maybe five minutes
left in the tank.

05:09.667 --> 05:10.500
Go!

05:10.583 --> 05:12.041
You go. Go!

05:14.542 --> 05:15.542
I stay.

05:50.542 --> 05:52.208
Oh, bloody hell.

05:58.917 --> 06:01.375
Don't land! You can't land!

06:01.458 --> 06:02.458
Go back!

06:06.959 --> 06:08.250
Go back!

06:10.375 --> 06:12.166
There's a bomb! Go back, there's a...

06:13.375 --> 06:16.583
-Get away! There's a bomb!
-Did he say "bomb"?

06:16.959 --> 06:17.792
[Desmond] Go back!

06:19.250 --> 06:21.875
-What are you doing?
-I don't care what he's screaming!

06:21.959 --> 06:24.291
I'm flying on fumes!
I gotta put this bird down.

06:25.417 --> 06:27.625
No! Don't land!

06:55.917 --> 06:57.583
No, no! Look, you don't understand.

06:58.041 --> 07:00.125
Jin and Michael are doing everything
they can, but there's no time!

07:01.000 --> 07:02.417
You've gotta get off the boat now!

07:04.583 --> 07:05.750
How long till we can fly again?

07:05.834 --> 07:07.583
Somebody patch the other hole,
where the bullet came out.

07:07.667 --> 07:10.083
-Give it to me, I'll do it.
-Here. Somebody pump some gas!

07:10.166 --> 07:11.917
-I'll handle the fuel.
-Get that life raft, right there!

07:12.000 --> 07:13.834
-[man] Let's go!
-[man] Come on.

07:17.375 --> 07:18.250
Hey, Sun!

07:19.166 --> 07:20.667
Sun! Where are you going?

07:20.750 --> 07:23.375
-Jin's below with Michael.
-There's no time.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.625
-I won't leave him!
-OK. Get the baby on the chopper.

07:26.709 --> 07:27.750
I'll get Jin, all right?

07:28.375 --> 07:31.166
Just keep pumping till I get it started.
That'll be enough to get to the island.

07:42.041 --> 07:43.333
Jin, you gotta go.

07:43.417 --> 07:45.417
-There's nothing more we can do.
-No, I can find--

07:45.500 --> 07:47.500
Hey! Come on, it's over.

07:47.583 --> 07:51.792
I'm almost out of this stuff.
Listen, you are a father now.

07:52.834 --> 07:54.834
Get to your wife and get her home.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.542
Thank you, Michael.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.083
You're welcome.

08:00.166 --> 08:01.166
Go.

08:10.208 --> 08:12.625
-Hey
-Your buddy said we got five minutes

08:12.709 --> 08:15.041
thats three minutes ago.
If you're going, this is it. Let's go!

08:15.125 --> 08:17.250
-Kate!
-Jin's still inside!

08:21.208 --> 08:22.834
Jin's still inside.
Can't leave him behind.

08:22.917 --> 08:25.375
I'm not leaving without you.
We gotta get out of here now.

08:27.000 --> 08:27.917
Let's go!

08:37.125 --> 08:39.959
-Give me a minute! No!
-Where's Jin?

08:54.625 --> 08:55.625
It's Jin!

08:59.709 --> 09:00.792
Jin!

09:01.208 --> 09:04.709
-Jin! We have to go back! Turn around!
-We can't do it!

09:04.792 --> 09:06.917
But we have to! We need to go back!

09:24.792 --> 09:26.500
You can go now, Michael.

09:27.083 --> 09:28.041
Who are you?

09:32.417 --> 09:34.500
Jin!

09:44.291 --> 09:46.875
Jin!

09:56.083 --> 09:57.917
[In Korean] Hello?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.834
Hello! Someone wants to
talk to you!

10:00.917 --> 10:02.792
Say hello to your mother,
Ji Yeon.

10:02.875 --> 10:04.041
Mama. Mama.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.041
Hello my love!

10:06.125 --> 10:08.083
Where are you?

10:08.166 --> 10:10.083
I'm in London.
I leave tonight.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.333
Just finishing a little business.

10:12.417 --> 10:14.959
Fly safe.

10:15.041 --> 10:17.583
I will. Goodbye mother.

10:19.250 --> 10:20.375
[in English] All right, guys. Thanks.

10:31.250 --> 10:33.583
Excuse me, Mr. Widmore?

10:33.917 --> 10:36.083
-Yes?
-I'm Sun Kwon.

10:36.542 --> 10:37.542
Mr. Paik's daughter.

10:37.917 --> 10:40.250
I'm the managing director
of Paik Industries.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.792
Yes, of course. How is your father?

10:42.875 --> 10:44.250
Excellent, thank you.

10:44.667 --> 10:48.542
Quite the golfer. I believe I owe him
dinner after our last game.

10:51.041 --> 10:53.625
Are you really going to pretend
that you don't know who I am?

10:55.333 --> 10:57.709
I'm afraid, I don't know what you're
talking about, Ms. Kwon.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.000
Yes, you do know, Mr. Widmore.

11:00.750 --> 11:03.834
Just like you know we've been lying
all this time about where we were

11:04.667 --> 11:06.000
and what happened to us there.

11:09.709 --> 11:11.375
You and I have common interests.

11:14.750 --> 11:18.166
When you're ready to discuss them,
call me.

11:21.750 --> 11:25.792
As you know, we're not the only ones
who left the island.

11:30.834 --> 11:31.792
Ms. Kwon.

11:34.083 --> 11:35.333
Why would you want to help me?

11:48.125 --> 11:50.709
Go down lower. We have to go find Jin.

11:50.792 --> 11:53.667
-Sun, there's nobody down there.
-We can't see anything from here!

11:53.750 --> 11:55.917
We didn't get enough fuel!
We can't go back!

11:56.500 --> 11:58.500
-Sun, I'm so sorry.
-He's down there!

11:58.583 --> 12:02.125
I know he's down there!
No, I'm not leaving him!

12:02.208 --> 12:04.500
-Sun!
-No, we're not leaving him!

12:05.041 --> 12:08.709
-We're not! Turn back around!
-Sun! It's gone.

12:12.792 --> 12:13.792
He's gone.

12:28.333 --> 12:31.208
Lapidus! Fly us back to the island.

12:32.542 --> 12:33.458
You got it.

12:35.417 --> 12:36.250
No!

12:37.667 --> 12:39.458
No! No!

12:40.709 --> 12:42.417
No!

12:44.125 --> 12:45.375
Why?

12:45.875 --> 12:46.875
Why what?

12:47.500 --> 12:50.417
Why did you kill him when you knew
it would destroy the boat?

12:50.667 --> 12:52.625
Oh John I really wasn't thinking straight.

12:53.834 --> 12:54.792
Sometimes,

12:57.625 --> 12:59.417
good command decisions get compromised

12:59.500 --> 13:01.208
by bad emotional responses.

13:05.250 --> 13:08.750
I'm sure you'll do a much better job
of separating the two than I ever did.

13:15.792 --> 13:16.875
What are you doing?

13:20.542 --> 13:22.125
I asked you a question!

13:22.208 --> 13:23.709
If I were you I'd duck.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.625
I'd better change.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.500
Nice day for a swim.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.250
What are you doing here?

14:21.667 --> 14:22.917
Decided to take a dip.

14:27.542 --> 14:28.583
What you celebrating?

14:30.166 --> 14:31.500
I'm not celebrating.

14:47.959 --> 14:49.208
Is that our boat?

14:50.208 --> 14:51.125
It was.

15:07.208 --> 15:08.083
What's that for?

15:08.792 --> 15:10.083
I'm going somewhere cold.

15:11.792 --> 15:12.709
And where is mine?

15:14.083 --> 15:15.875
You don't need one because
you're not going with me.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.500
-Yes, I am going with you.
-No, John, you're not.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.667
Jacob told me what we had to do.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.125
-You don't get to make all the--
-He told you what to do

15:23.208 --> 15:24.208
but he didn't tell you how.

15:24.709 --> 15:26.917
Because he wants me to suffer
the consequences.

15:28.125 --> 15:29.291
What consequences?

15:36.625 --> 15:38.625
Whoever moves the island
can never come back.

15:42.291 --> 15:44.625
So I'd like you to get on the elevator,
John, and go back up.

15:45.458 --> 15:48.125
Richard and my people will be waiting
two miles east of the Orchid.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.875
-Waiting for me?
-Ready, willing and able

15:55.250 --> 15:56.709
to share what they know

16:00.667 --> 16:02.417
then they will follow your every word.

16:06.041 --> 16:06.959
Goodbye, John.

16:12.709 --> 16:14.500
I'm sorry I made your life so miserable.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.083
What do I tell them to do?

16:33.250 --> 16:35.959
You'll find your way, John. You always do.

17:15.542 --> 17:16.583
Hello, John.

17:25.417 --> 17:26.291
Welcome home.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.583
I hope you're happy now, Jacob.

20:14.792 --> 20:16.542
[Magnetic Wave]

20:43.750 --> 20:44.625
What is that?

20:44.709 --> 20:45.917
[baby cries]

21:55.917 --> 21:56.792
Where's the island?

21:58.208 --> 21:59.542
Where's the island!

22:05.959 --> 22:08.500
-Where the hell's the island?
-It's gone.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.250
Where the hell am I gonna land this thing?

22:18.041 --> 22:21.208
There's another smaller island
close by they took us to.

22:21.667 --> 22:22.959
I got news for you, doc!

22:23.041 --> 22:25.041
There's nothing but water
in every direction.

22:25.125 --> 22:27.041
[beeping]

22:28.583 --> 22:32.083
Doesn't matter now.
That's it, people, we're out of fuel!

22:42.291 --> 22:44.500
Get your life vests on! We're going in!

22:53.959 --> 22:55.500
Brace yourselves!

22:59.542 --> 23:01.083
Desmond, the life raft!

23:02.417 --> 23:03.834
Hold on!

23:34.125 --> 23:35.417
[indistinct voice]

23:42.083 --> 23:44.166
-Sayid, are you all right?
-[Sayid] Yes.

23:45.417 --> 23:47.834
-[Frank] Sun? Where's Desmond?
-[woman] Get the baby.

23:47.917 --> 23:49.208
I got it.

23:57.083 --> 23:58.041
[man] Desmond!

24:01.625 --> 24:03.458
[man] Jack, give me a hand!

24:08.959 --> 24:10.834
Get him to the raft, get him to the raft!

24:18.959 --> 24:19.792
Get him up.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.041
-We gotta get him up.
-Is he breathing?

24:22.125 --> 24:23.709
-[Hugo] Oh, my God.
-Is he breathing?

24:39.917 --> 24:41.417
Oh, come on, Desmond.

24:56.959 --> 24:59.458
[whispering] One, two, three, four...

25:00.250 --> 25:01.083
Yeah.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.083
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:08.875 --> 25:09.917
Yeah, you're all right.

25:10.875 --> 25:13.375
-You all right?
-OK, sit up.

25:15.750 --> 25:17.375
You're all right. That's it.

25:33.542 --> 25:34.458
It's OK.

25:35.500 --> 25:38.041
It's OK. We're alive.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.250
[phone rings]

26:17.709 --> 26:18.583
Hello?

26:21.625 --> 26:22.625
Hello, who's there?

26:25.750 --> 26:27.041
[speaking foreign language]

26:52.667 --> 26:53.542
[in English] Don't move.

26:55.041 --> 26:56.875
Don't you touch my son!

27:07.792 --> 27:08.625
Claire.

27:12.542 --> 27:14.667
-How did you...?
-Don't bring him back, Kate.

27:21.166 --> 27:24.250
Don't you dare bring him back.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.375
I'm sorry.

28:15.417 --> 28:16.375
I'm sorry.

28:28.792 --> 28:29.625
Is he OK?

28:32.750 --> 28:33.709
He's fine.

28:35.750 --> 28:36.709
It's a miracle.

28:42.875 --> 28:43.917
I can't believe he did it.

28:45.583 --> 28:46.542
Who did what?

28:47.583 --> 28:48.417
Locke.

28:50.250 --> 28:51.625
He moved the island.

28:53.083 --> 28:54.041
No, he didn't.

28:57.333 --> 28:58.166
Oh, really?

28:59.375 --> 29:02.083
'Cause one minute it was there,
the next it was gone,

29:02.166 --> 29:07.375
so, unless we, like, overlooked it, dude,
that's exactly what he did.

29:09.500 --> 29:12.667
But, if you've got another explanation,
man, I'd love to hear it.

29:22.250 --> 29:23.375
God Almighty.

29:25.667 --> 29:26.667
There's a boat.

29:28.834 --> 29:30.041
There's a boat out there!

29:32.917 --> 29:33.959
Hey!

29:34.333 --> 29:37.083
-There's a boat! You see it?
-[all] Hey!

29:37.166 --> 29:39.625
-Hey! Over here!
-[man] Does it see us?

29:40.875 --> 29:41.834
I think it does.

29:42.125 --> 29:44.291
-Hey!
-Hey!

29:44.875 --> 29:45.875
[Frank] Is it turning?

29:47.125 --> 29:50.166
[Frank] It's turning! Hey!

29:50.583 --> 29:51.709
We're gonna have to lie.

29:55.625 --> 29:58.000
-What?
-We're gonna have to lie.

30:00.208 --> 30:02.750
-Lie about what?
-Everything. All of it.

30:03.750 --> 30:05.834
Every moment since we crashed
on the island.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.917
Jack, now I know I'm new to this group
and everything

30:12.000 --> 30:13.542
but isn't this the place
where everybody starts

30:13.625 --> 30:15.000
jumping up and down
and hugging each other?

30:15.083 --> 30:19.458
Your freighter, those men came
to the island to kill us, all of us.

30:21.542 --> 30:23.625
You said our plane was discovered
on the bottom of the ocean.

30:23.709 --> 30:24.625
Someone put it there,

30:24.750 --> 30:26.875
someone who wants everyone to think
we're dead.

30:29.333 --> 30:32.625
So what do you think will happen to us
when we tell them that wasn't our plane?

30:36.125 --> 30:38.208
What do you think will happen
to the people we left behind?

30:43.542 --> 30:44.458
Jack, we can't.

30:46.750 --> 30:48.083
We can't pull it off.

30:51.625 --> 30:52.875
Just let me do the talking.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.166
[speaking foreign language]

31:35.000 --> 31:37.333
[continuing to speak foreign language]

31:38.041 --> 31:38.959
[in English] Ms. Widmore.

31:42.375 --> 31:43.250
Ms. Widmore!

31:43.333 --> 31:44.750
[speaking foreign language]

31:48.166 --> 31:50.208
[in English] Throw them a rope.
Take them around to the stern.

31:53.458 --> 31:54.291
Penny?

31:59.208 --> 32:00.375
Penny!

32:57.917 --> 32:59.000
Are you OK?

33:00.125 --> 33:01.500
I'm fine.

33:02.125 --> 33:03.000
I'm fine.

33:06.417 --> 33:07.709
How did you find me?

33:08.667 --> 33:09.834
Your phone call.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.625
I have a tracking station.

33:18.750 --> 33:19.917
I love you, Penny.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.709
And I'll never leave you again.

33:31.208 --> 33:34.917
[speaking foreign language]

33:39.583 --> 33:42.667
This is Penny. This is Kate.

33:42.750 --> 33:44.208
-And her son Aaron.
-Hi.

33:47.834 --> 33:50.250
This is Sun. Sayid.

33:51.041 --> 33:52.417
-Hurley.
-Hi.

33:53.375 --> 33:54.500
This is Frank.

33:56.834 --> 33:58.750
And Jack. Jack, this is Penny.

33:59.625 --> 34:00.792
It's nice to meet you, Penny.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.333
Hi.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.625
But we need to talk.

34:20.125 --> 34:21.417
What's this place called?

34:22.959 --> 34:24.083
Membata.

34:24.667 --> 34:25.625
Membata.

34:30.834 --> 34:32.208
Why are we doing this, dude?

34:33.083 --> 34:35.291
Sailing 3,000 miles to another island.

34:36.750 --> 34:38.875
Because it's the only way
to keep them safe.

34:49.458 --> 34:52.583
-How long till we'll hit land?
-Well, if the wind's not too brutal,

34:53.583 --> 34:54.458
eight, nine hours.

34:56.041 --> 34:58.333
Just long enough to give you
a nice, convincing sunburn.

34:58.834 --> 35:01.750
Well, it's been a pleasure, Frank.

35:02.917 --> 35:05.542
-Hope we never see each other again.
-Roger that, doc.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.417
Bye, sweetheart.

35:24.500 --> 35:25.750
You sure about this, brother?

35:28.208 --> 35:29.250
Are you sure?

35:31.792 --> 35:33.375
As long as I've got Penny,

35:35.667 --> 35:36.750
I'll be fine.

35:39.083 --> 35:40.417
Don't let him find you, Desmond.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.709
I'll see you in another life, brother.

35:48.125 --> 35:48.959
Aye.

35:52.917 --> 35:53.750
All right.

35:55.417 --> 35:56.375
Let's go home.

36:22.208 --> 36:24.417
[indistinct voice]

36:39.291 --> 36:41.583
[speaking foreign language]

37:40.166 --> 37:42.583
[loud music playing]

39:23.583 --> 39:24.500
Hello, Jack.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.542
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

39:33.875 --> 39:35.709
Did he tell you that I was off the island?

39:40.125 --> 39:41.083
Yes, he did.

39:48.041 --> 39:49.208
When did you speak to him?

39:50.458 --> 39:52.000
[inhales deeply]

39:52.583 --> 39:53.750
About a month ago.

39:54.166 --> 39:55.291
And Kate?

39:57.250 --> 39:58.083
Yeah.

39:59.834 --> 40:01.500
Yeah, he came to see her too.

40:02.625 --> 40:03.667
And what did he say to you?

40:05.792 --> 40:06.667
He told me

40:08.250 --> 40:10.000
that after I left the island

40:12.625 --> 40:14.458
some very bad things happened.

40:18.250 --> 40:20.041
And he told me that it was my fault,

40:21.500 --> 40:22.417
for leaving.

40:25.667 --> 40:27.667
And he said that I had to come back.

40:29.917 --> 40:32.333
Yes, I heard you've been flying
on passenger planes.

40:34.542 --> 40:35.917
Hoping that you'd crash.

40:38.792 --> 40:41.125
It's dark, Jack, very dark.

40:42.542 --> 40:43.583
Why are you here?

40:46.208 --> 40:49.000
I'm here to tell you
that the island won't let you come alone.

40:57.458 --> 40:59.208
All of you have to go back.

41:00.375 --> 41:01.208
Are you...

41:05.291 --> 41:07.333
Sayid, I don't even know where Sayid is.

41:08.291 --> 41:09.125
Hurley,

41:10.250 --> 41:11.375
is insane.

41:12.542 --> 41:13.792
Sun blames me for...

41:16.875 --> 41:17.917
And Kate,

41:21.583 --> 41:23.208
she won't even talk to me any more.

41:24.250 --> 41:25.625
Perhaps I can help you with that.

41:29.792 --> 41:33.083
This is the way it has to be, Jack.
It's the only way.

41:35.834 --> 41:37.959
You have to do it together, all of you.

41:39.750 --> 41:40.583
How?

41:42.333 --> 41:43.917
I have a few ideas.

41:59.333 --> 42:00.166
Jack.

42:01.375 --> 42:02.417
I said all of you.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.500
We're gonna have to bring him too.
