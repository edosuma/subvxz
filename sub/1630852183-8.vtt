00:08.175 --> 00:10.177
[Camille] 300,000 years ago,

00:10.177 --> 00:12.513
when humans first walked
this planet,

00:12.513 --> 00:14.265
life was so much simpler.

00:14.265 --> 00:18.269
You hunt, eat, build a fire,
build a home,

00:18.269 --> 00:20.896
find a person, have a family.

00:20.896 --> 00:23.983
There was nothing to choose,
so there was nothing to lose.

00:23.983 --> 00:25.901
Well, except maybe your life
in childbirth,

00:25.901 --> 00:28.612
or a saber-toothed
tiger attack or whatever.

00:28.612 --> 00:29.989
In today's Harlem,

00:29.989 --> 00:33.784
we make 35,000 conscious
decisions every day--

00:33.784 --> 00:36.787
some insignificant,
some long-lasting,

00:36.787 --> 00:38.831
but every now and then,

00:38.831 --> 00:42.042
there's that one decision
on that one day

00:42.042 --> 00:44.086
that changes everything.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.546
Mmm.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.465
- Are we making a mistake?
- Mm?

00:47.465 --> 00:49.133
I just feel like
we shouldn't be doing this.

00:49.133 --> 00:50.718
Sweetie, why not?

00:50.718 --> 00:53.471
Oh, it's just, we have so much
to do before we leave, right?

00:53.471 --> 00:55.848
[sighs]
We're moving to Paris tonight.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.600
I mean, we have to be
forgetting something.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.812
[singer]

01:01.812 --> 01:05.149
- Camille.
- Hmm?

01:05.149 --> 01:07.026
Baby, you worry too much.
We're good.

01:07.026 --> 01:09.153
It's all done.
Mmm.

01:09.153 --> 01:10.488
Yeah, you're right.

01:10.488 --> 01:12.239
Although,
I did forget to do this.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.700
[laughs]

01:14.700 --> 01:16.619
Oh, yeah.
Oh!

01:16.619 --> 01:20.748
We definitely don't want you
to forget to do that.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.667
Mm, that smells good.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.669
What'd you order?

01:25.669 --> 01:27.463
Wait, you cooked?

01:27.463 --> 01:28.839
With what?
Everything was packed up.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.049
[Ian] Not everything.

01:30.049 --> 01:31.634
If there's one thing
I've learned from Iron Chef,

01:31.634 --> 01:34.136
it's that if you have eggs and
anything else, you have a meal.

01:34.136 --> 01:35.221
Mm-hmm.

01:35.221 --> 01:37.097
See, where were you
when I was growing up?

01:37.097 --> 01:39.391
We never had more than
three things in the fridge,

01:39.391 --> 01:41.644
and my mom
hated grocery stores.

01:41.644 --> 01:43.312
She said they overwhelmed her.

01:43.312 --> 01:44.313
You know, the more I learn
about your mom,

01:44.313 --> 01:45.523
the more I wonder

01:45.523 --> 01:47.107
how your type A ass
even came out of her.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.609
She a trip.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.693
More like a journey.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.654
Ever hear back from her?

01:51.654 --> 01:53.572
Yeah.

01:53.572 --> 01:58.828
She text, so we are gonna try,
yet again, to meet up.

01:58.828 --> 02:00.788
She's taking the train
into the city today.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.666
Oh, that's cutting it close.

02:03.666 --> 02:05.459
Yeah.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.877
But, I mean,
that's good though.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.712
I'm glad y'all
are getting together.

02:08.712 --> 02:10.130
Okay, let me get some of
this food 'cause you know

02:10.130 --> 02:12.758
I got 100 goodbyes today,
and this hunger...

02:12.758 --> 02:14.593
- Mmm.
- It's one of them.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.428
[singer]

02:16.428 --> 02:17.638
[Angie] Oh, okay.
[chuckles]

02:17.638 --> 02:19.515
Now it's back-to-back meetings.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.600
Listen, Jennifer,

02:21.600 --> 02:24.353
you tell Stephen
that Angie Wilson

02:24.353 --> 02:26.939
has listened to Power 105

02:26.939 --> 02:29.733
for six fucking hours

02:29.733 --> 02:32.820
and did not hear her soaring,
yet highly controlled

02:32.820 --> 02:37.491
vocal runs of "Flow Into You"
gracing the airwaves.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.995
And since he seems
to love meetings so much,

02:40.995 --> 02:44.874
maybe I should just roll up
on your office this afternoon

02:44.874 --> 02:47.543
and have an impromptu
face-to-face

02:47.543 --> 02:49.169
to discuss his priorities.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.088
Bitch, bye.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.299
[singer]

03:00.097 --> 03:03.017
Uh, hello?
Some of us live here.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.810
[singer]

03:04.810 --> 03:09.648
Tune your shit to Power 105.
I better hear myself.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.233
Yeah, no, of course.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.860
We're always happy
when we can help you

03:12.860 --> 03:15.237
avoid those taxes.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.989
Mm-hmm.

03:16.989 --> 03:20.034
Yes, absolutely.
Bye-bye.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.911
Perfect timing.

03:21.911 --> 03:24.288
I was just finishing up a phone
call with Walter...

03:24.288 --> 03:25.623
[both] McDougall.

03:25.623 --> 03:27.708
Wow, that's crazy.
I was just thinking about him.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.293
You know, he could do
a take-out mortgage.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.253
- And if you lock it in at...
[both] 3%...

03:31.253 --> 03:32.546
And then he can
still consider it

03:32.546 --> 03:34.006
a home purchase even if he...

03:34.006 --> 03:36.175
[both] Makes it a rental.

03:36.175 --> 03:40.387
You and I are always
on the same page.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.640
Tell me, is it weird
that hearing my girlfriend

03:42.640 --> 03:45.309
do all this finance talk
is turning me on?

03:48.979 --> 03:52.524
Would I still turn you on
if I didn't do this?

03:52.524 --> 03:53.817
[laughs]
What?

03:53.817 --> 03:55.736
- Knock, knock.
- Mother.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.905
Daughter.
Future son-in-law.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.949
- Mom.
- [laughs]

03:59.949 --> 04:01.158
Good to see you again,
Patricia.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.161
- I will call you after.
- All right, babe.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.163
Mom, if you keep calling him
son-in-law

04:06.163 --> 04:08.499
before he proposes,
you're gonna run him off.

04:08.499 --> 04:10.542
Or I will manifest a marriage.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.586
Now that you can do,
but what you can't do

04:12.586 --> 04:14.838
is just keep popping in here
whenever you want.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.924
Oh, I'm sorry, Quinnie.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.551
I just can't resist
seeing my working girl.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.972
Look at you in your skirt suit.
I love it.

04:22.972 --> 04:24.473
Perfect man.
Perfect job.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.100
Mom, please.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.435
Why can't you celebrate
your successes?

04:28.435 --> 04:29.645
I do.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.188
In fact,
I'm here to have lunch

04:31.188 --> 04:34.733
with one of the youngest VPs in
the history of JPMorgan Chase.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.318
Mom, I wish I could go
to lunch with you,

04:36.318 --> 04:39.029
but I just have so much.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.448
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.534
Don't you apologize
for working.

04:43.534 --> 04:46.537
Someday you'll be CEO
in a corner office

04:46.537 --> 04:48.956
and you take your mother
to lunch whenever you want.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.124
Deal.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.001
- [phone rings]
- Okay, I'll be going.

04:52.001 --> 04:55.170
Oh, and tell Camille
bon voyage.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.464
Although, Paris--really?

04:57.464 --> 05:00.467
I mean, why now?
You know?

05:00.467 --> 05:02.177
- [laughs]
- [stammers] I don't get it.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.721
[chuckles]
Bye, Mom.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.891
[phone ringing]

05:07.891 --> 05:09.601
[singer]

05:09.601 --> 05:11.311
Quinn Joseph.
How can I help?

05:14.189 --> 05:15.941
[Neil]
Let's see, women.

05:15.941 --> 05:18.777
They install 40% more apps
than men.

05:18.777 --> 05:21.030
So why the fuck aren't
we building more for them?

05:21.030 --> 05:24.658
Tell me somebody
has something for women.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.201
Yeah, I got something.

05:26.201 --> 05:30.914
So it's a special calendar that
reminds a woman 24 to 48 hours

05:30.914 --> 05:33.917
before the start
of her menstrual cycle.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.295
And best part is,
it's automatically shared

05:36.295 --> 05:38.756
with her co-workers,
her husband,

05:38.756 --> 05:42.342
so everyone knows when she's
about to be a major bitch.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.637
- [laughter]
- I call it Red Alert.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.557
Yes!
Yes!

05:48.557 --> 05:50.934
See, that is thinking
like a woman.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.728
[hip-hop music]

05:52.728 --> 05:54.063
[singer]

05:54.063 --> 05:56.023
[Tye]
It's so fucking offensive.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.901
Even when it's for women,
it's like I'm not even there.

05:58.901 --> 06:01.028
Then fuck it.
Do something else.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.654
We're always hiring
across the hall at "Fierce."

06:02.654 --> 06:04.740
Mm-hmm, but you're not paying.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.075
Magazines take time.

06:06.075 --> 06:07.701
And life takes cash.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.578
I'm barely making rent
as it is.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.289
And I may have
a solution for that.

06:12.289 --> 06:13.457
Really?

06:13.457 --> 06:15.834
- Check the fries.
- What?

06:15.834 --> 06:18.087
When I made you go get napkins,
I hid it in there,

06:18.087 --> 06:20.923
but I gotta get back
to work in a minute, so...

06:20.923 --> 06:23.550
Oh, my God.
Is this a...

06:23.550 --> 06:25.385
Tyesha May Reynolds,

06:25.385 --> 06:27.638
we've been together a year
and there's no one else

06:27.638 --> 06:29.389
I'd rather share my life with.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.809
Will you move in with me?

06:31.809 --> 06:34.353
- For real?
- Yes, for real.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.899
Forever.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.484
- Yes.
- Yeah?

06:40.484 --> 06:43.445
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.322
[passionate R&B music]

06:45.322 --> 06:46.824
Yes.

06:46.824 --> 06:48.492
[singers vocalizing]

06:48.492 --> 06:51.203
[singer]

06:53.205 --> 06:54.456
[knock at door]

06:54.456 --> 06:56.708
Hey.
This is it.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.460
Well, how do I get to stay
in denial

06:58.460 --> 07:01.839
that you're leaving if
you're actually saying goodbye?

07:01.839 --> 07:04.049
P.S., this Paleo shit
better be working.

07:04.049 --> 07:06.385
You know how hard it is
to get a half a pound of steak

07:06.385 --> 07:08.095
delivered
at ten in the morning?

07:08.095 --> 07:10.597
Well, it is definitely
working because you look great.

07:10.597 --> 07:14.184
I'm an academic. I don't care
about that superficial crap.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.770
But thank God.
I better look great.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.814
I would literally kill
for bread.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.649
You don't happen to have
a little Hawaiian roll

07:20.649 --> 07:22.192
or a baguette in your purse,
do you?

07:22.192 --> 07:23.986
Oh, damn.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.445
The rolls are in
my other purse.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.782
- Sit down.
- [sighs]

07:28.782 --> 07:30.868
- So this is goodbye.
- Yeah.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.744
[Robin]
And you're 100% sure you want

07:32.744 --> 07:34.830
to interrupt
your academic career?

07:34.830 --> 07:37.166
Oh, no,
this is not a disruption.

07:37.166 --> 07:38.417
I've done all of my coursework.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.043
Now it's just down
to writing my dissertation

07:40.043 --> 07:41.753
and I can do that anywhere.

07:41.753 --> 07:45.132
And anywhere happens
to be Paris.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.676
- So I can be with Ian.
[Robin] Oh, Camille.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.721
Overstepping every
student-teacher boundary.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.682
I did the same thing,

07:53.682 --> 07:57.769
and I regret it so much.

07:57.769 --> 08:01.481
By the time I was your age,
I was married with two kids.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.776
I put my education on hold,
my goals on hold,

08:04.776 --> 08:06.904
while he was in medical school.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.405
And then he had his residency

08:08.405 --> 08:12.701
and I worked terrible jobs
just to make ends meet.

08:12.701 --> 08:13.911
Kinko's.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.205
I was a hostess
at the Red Lobster.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.498
- I actually like Red Lobster.
[Robin] Please.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.626
Suicide would have
seemed redundant.

08:20.626 --> 08:24.046
Meanwhile, he didn't even
do one school drop-off.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.339
We were building
a life together,

08:25.339 --> 08:27.966
so I sucked it up
until he got it sucked up

08:27.966 --> 08:29.384
by one of the other residents--

08:29.384 --> 08:31.762
blonde,
tits as big as cannonballs.

08:31.762 --> 08:33.889
But Ian, he's not like that.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.683
History is littered with women
who had to start over

08:36.683 --> 08:41.688
because they had to make
sacrifices for a man's dream.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.482
Okay,
I'm not gonna say anymore.

08:43.482 --> 08:45.442
You're a big girl.
You know what you're doing.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.319
Just one more thing.

08:47.319 --> 08:51.198
Even if you stayed on track
with your thesis writing--

08:51.198 --> 08:53.700
and let's be real,
that's a big if--

08:53.700 --> 08:56.119
I mean, let's be honest.
This is Paris.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.454
Sex, croissants.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.290
The men there--
they're so gross, they're hot.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.626
I mean,
what can compete with that?

09:02.626 --> 09:06.088
And even if you did right,
you still can't TA.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.715
You can't hang out with
the senior faculty members--

09:08.715 --> 09:10.467
all things that are necessary

09:10.467 --> 09:12.761
for you to become
a tenured professor here.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.972
Isn't that your dream?

09:14.972 --> 09:16.390
Yes.

But I'm too fucking old

our first female president.

That might be your most
compelling argument.

I am really gonna miss you.

I'm gonna really miss you

- Call me crazy,

means an expiration date.

We have to be on that flight.

she gonna show up.

We could go to the airport
and surprise her.

just call him "driver?"

12:34.838 --> 12:36.590
I mean,
should I be doing that too?

I mean, is it crazy to just
make a sudden change like that?

the same thing.

Well, Mom,
I called you over here

14:03.552 --> 14:08.265
because I wanted
to let you know that I...

14:08.265 --> 14:10.892
quit my job.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.102
You what?

14:12.102 --> 14:14.563
- I quit.
- After I left?

14:14.563 --> 14:15.939
I had to.
I'm sorry.

14:15.939 --> 14:18.024
I was miserable.

14:18.024 --> 14:22.112
I'm--I'm stunned.
Did you get another job?

14:22.112 --> 14:24.656
No, not yet,
but I saved up some money.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.199
So I'll be okay for a while.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.326
Why'd you quit
without another job?

14:28.326 --> 14:30.412
Because I wanna start
my own business.

14:30.412 --> 14:32.080
No, no.

Yes.
Look, I get it.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.128
The reason why you love me
is because you got a chance

to all of your friends

14:41.214 --> 14:43.925

You are my child,

15:01.359 --> 15:04.571
and I liked that job or any job

15:04.571 --> 15:07.240
because you were
supporting yourself.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.992
You were earning
your own money.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.745
You will forgive me for
pointing out the obvious irony

15:11.745 --> 15:15.707
that you would lecture me
about earning my own money?

15:15.707 --> 15:19.753
It is because I rely
on your father for money

your father go through this

You need a lot of money
to start a business.

you will come back to us.

things will change.

19:59.407 --> 20:02.035
I didn't think
that was even an option.

20:02.035 --> 20:07.040
And he was like my best friend
through high school.

20:07.040 --> 20:12.337
And one day we were hanging out
and we made out.

20:12.337 --> 20:14.589
Our first kiss...
[scoffs]

20:14.589 --> 20:16.424
I didn't know what
it was supposed to feel like,

20:16.424 --> 20:20.303
so I didn't know it felt so...

20:20.303 --> 20:22.639
nothing.

20:22.639 --> 20:25.141
And it was like I was sitting
on the other side of the room,

20:25.141 --> 20:28.311
watching myself
kissing this guy,

20:28.311 --> 20:31.522
thinking, "He's nice enough."

20:31.522 --> 20:33.399
We could get married
and I could be normal.

20:33.399 --> 20:39.030
And all this shit I was feeling
about women would...

20:39.030 --> 20:42.659
I don't know, I'd get over it.

20:44.661 --> 20:48.665
But of course,
that's not how it works.

20:48.665 --> 20:52.418
Things just got
more and more intense.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.921
And I wanted to tell him.

20:54.921 --> 20:58.424
I tried.
I tried like a million times.

21:00.551 --> 21:03.972
But he was so sweet.

21:03.972 --> 21:07.850
And all he talked about
was our future

21:07.850 --> 21:10.520
and all that we could do.

21:13.356 --> 21:16.567
I couldn't stand to hurt him.

21:18.236 --> 21:22.031
So you just ran away.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.909
And never looked back.

21:24.909 --> 21:27.745
And you didn't think
just vanishing would hurt him?

21:27.745 --> 21:30.289
I know.
I know.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.584
See, this is why I never told
this story to anyone,

21:33.584 --> 21:34.919
but I love you.

21:34.919 --> 21:39.757
And--and I want to be honest
so that we can move forward.

21:39.757 --> 21:43.011
[scoffs]
I'm sorry, Tye.

21:43.011 --> 21:45.763
This is about
100 kinds of fucked up.

21:45.763 --> 21:49.225
I mean, you kept this from me?
All this time?

21:49.225 --> 21:50.810
I felt guilty for so long.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.186
Oh, but not guilty enough
to actually

21:52.186 --> 21:55.189
do anything about it.

21:55.189 --> 21:59.819
That is so beyond selfish.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.488
And what happens
if you freak out here, huh?

22:02.488 --> 22:04.032
Decide you're in
the wrong life again?

22:04.032 --> 22:05.116
Will I wake up and you're gone?

22:05.116 --> 22:07.285
Baby, no, that...

22:07.285 --> 22:09.871
that would literally
never happen.

22:09.871 --> 22:14.417
Yeah, I bet your husband
thought the same thing.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.377
I...

22:16.377 --> 22:20.715
Yeah, I don't, um...
I need a timeout.

22:20.715 --> 22:23.092
Timeout, like--
like, for now, or...

22:23.092 --> 22:24.469
Mm-mm, I gotta go.

22:24.469 --> 22:27.096
Please, don't do this.

22:27.096 --> 22:30.099
[pensive beat]

22:33.269 --> 22:34.812
[screams]

22:34.812 --> 22:37.398
This is taking forever.

22:37.398 --> 22:38.524
Yep.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.151
So what, you're just
gonna stay mad at me?

22:40.151 --> 22:43.529
No, I'm--I'm fine.
I'm just tired.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.782
All right.
Well, I can handle this alone.

22:45.782 --> 22:48.201
Why don't you--why don't you
go home and get some sleep?

22:48.201 --> 22:50.244
We packed up all the bedding.

22:50.244 --> 22:51.788
And the subletter will be there
in the morning,

22:51.788 --> 22:53.664
and it would just be weird
for me to be there.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.291
All right, well, look,
if the subletter does show up,

22:55.291 --> 22:56.709
just let him know
that we're leaving as soon

22:56.709 --> 22:58.461
as we get this passport thing
handled, all right?

22:58.461 --> 23:00.880
He'll understand.
Plans change.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.924
No, Ian, plans don't change.

23:02.924 --> 23:05.468
People fuck up,
and that changes plans.

23:05.468 --> 23:07.428
You're totally right, Camille,

23:07.428 --> 23:09.430
but I've never heard
of something like this.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.432
I mean, why have an expiration
date if it was not real?

23:11.432 --> 23:13.267
You know, one Google search
could've told you this.

23:13.267 --> 23:15.061
All right,
but not for nothing.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.355
I mean, you didn't know.

23:17.355 --> 23:19.982
Why is it up to me?
Always?

23:19.982 --> 23:21.567
Why do I have to be
the responsible one?

23:21.567 --> 23:23.945
So everybody else
gets to change plans?

23:23.945 --> 23:25.446
You know, my whole life,

23:25.446 --> 23:27.448
I've had to deal with my mother
constantly changing plans

23:27.448 --> 23:29.784
without any consideration
about how I felt.

23:29.784 --> 23:32.370
- Just breathe.
- I don't wanna breathe.

23:32.370 --> 23:34.705
I wanna stick
to the fucking plan.

23:34.705 --> 23:38.167
Except here I am suddenly
changing my whole career plan.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.336
Fuck, am I my mother?

23:40.336 --> 23:42.296
Camille, no one is your mother
but your mother.

23:42.296 --> 23:43.714
What if that passport
had been our child

23:43.714 --> 23:44.966
that you forgot
to pick up from school

23:44.966 --> 23:46.467
because you have
a change of plans?

23:46.467 --> 23:48.553
- Oh, so we have children now?
- I don't know, Ian, do we?

23:48.553 --> 23:49.887
Or is social services
about to take them

23:49.887 --> 23:50.847
because you changed the plans?

23:50.847 --> 23:52.181
Whoa, Camille.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.432
I mean,
where are we even staying?

23:53.432 --> 23:54.559
We're staying with
the host family, you know that.

23:54.559 --> 23:55.977
- Yeah, but for how long?
- Just--

23:55.977 --> 23:58.062
How long are we in
someone's guest room?

23:58.062 --> 23:59.438
And that chef
that you're studying under--

23:59.438 --> 24:00.690
is he even guaranteeing you
a job?

24:00.690 --> 24:02.108
All right, you're spiraling now.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.276
Yes, of course, I'm spiraling,
'cause I can't take

24:03.276 --> 24:04.735
this fly-by-night shit.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.445
[clerk] Next.
- [sighs]

24:08.781 --> 24:11.367
Hi.
Here you go.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.202
- You want this expedited?
- Yes, ma'am.

24:13.202 --> 24:14.453
I have a flight.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.122
Had a flight.
We missed it.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.707
'Cause you know, plans change.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.333
Who you telling?
[chuckles]

24:19.333 --> 24:21.836
That'll be $1,000.12
for overnight renewal.

24:21.836 --> 24:25.256
$1,000?

24:25.256 --> 24:28.134
I'm sorry, I had no idea
it was gonna be this expensive.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.469
That's another
Google-that-shit moment.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.346
Just give the lady
your credit card.

24:32.346 --> 24:35.600
- Shit's maxed out.
- What?

24:35.600 --> 24:37.351
- What have you been buying?
- [chuckles]

24:37.351 --> 24:38.686
Okay, you know what?
It's okay.

24:38.686 --> 24:44.233
I will take care of it as usual.

24:44.233 --> 24:48.154
Put 600 on this card and put
the remainder on this card.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.531
And if it doesn't go through,
you can put 250 on this one

24:50.531 --> 24:53.576
and put the remainder
on this one.

24:53.576 --> 24:56.913
[soft dramatic music]

24:56.913 --> 25:00.458
And the thing with decisions,
the really big ones,

25:00.458 --> 25:02.710
is they can be so overwhelming

25:02.710 --> 25:06.839
that sometimes they take
an entire lifetime to make.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.341
[Robin] History is littered
with women

25:08.341 --> 25:11.010
who have to start over
because they made sacrifices

25:11.010 --> 25:12.470
for a man's dream.

25:12.470 --> 25:14.305
[Camille]
Or sometimes it takes a day.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.599
Hey, good walk?

25:16.599 --> 25:19.227
Here I am suddenly changing
my whole career plan.

25:19.227 --> 25:20.728
Fuck, am I my mother?

25:20.728 --> 25:23.189
And sometimes,
because of your lifetime...

25:23.189 --> 25:25.274
I can't take this
fly-by-night shit.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.984
Because of the day...

25:26.984 --> 25:29.362
And I regret it so much.

25:29.362 --> 25:31.989
[Camille]
You decide...

25:31.989 --> 25:34.533
The taxi is about
two minutes away.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.952
I'm not going.

25:35.952 --> 25:37.536
[Camille] In an instant.
- What?

25:37.536 --> 25:40.456
I'm sorry.

25:40.456 --> 25:44.001
I know this is...

25:44.001 --> 25:45.169
I just can't.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.295
Hold on, hold on.
Whoa, whoa, baby...

25:46.295 --> 25:49.340
No, I was up all last night,
and I--

25:49.340 --> 25:51.717
the passport thing is the best
thing that happened to us

25:51.717 --> 25:53.928
because it gave me a chance
to think about it--

25:53.928 --> 25:56.639
like, to really
think it through.

25:56.639 --> 25:57.807
Hold on, what--

25:57.807 --> 25:59.558
so the months that you took
to decide to go,

25:59.558 --> 26:01.018
that wasn't--
that wasn't thinking,

26:01.018 --> 26:02.645
but you had one little
sleepless stressful night?

26:02.645 --> 26:04.605
Don't do that.

26:06.190 --> 26:10.778
I know how this sounds.

26:10.778 --> 26:14.699
I feel like
I'm going back into chaos

26:14.699 --> 26:16.450
because that's what
I'm used to.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.077
Baby, Paris isn't chaos.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.662
Not for you.

26:19.662 --> 26:22.456
I mean,
you're chasing your dream.

26:22.456 --> 26:24.000
But where am I in that?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.294
You are the biggest part
of my dream, Camille.

26:26.294 --> 26:27.503
You're the biggest part of my...

26:27.503 --> 26:28.838
But to just go,

26:28.838 --> 26:31.507
to leave the life
that I want here--

26:31.507 --> 26:35.177
my friends, my work, my block?

26:35.177 --> 26:37.513
That's not me.

26:37.513 --> 26:40.266
So even if I was to go,
you wouldn't have me.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.310
And I don't know, maybe Paris
and me would be great,

26:42.310 --> 26:46.397
but I can't just
leave everything

26:46.397 --> 26:49.400
for some unknown future
with you.

26:51.569 --> 26:54.905
You have to do
what's best for you,

26:54.905 --> 26:56.532
but I have to do
what's best for me.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.327
Yeah, well, what about
what's right for us?

26:59.327 --> 27:02.580
You know what's crazy, is us...

27:02.580 --> 27:04.332
I mean,
the us that we were

27:04.332 --> 27:06.083
ended when you decided
to blow up the life

27:06.083 --> 27:09.045
that we were building here.

27:09.045 --> 27:10.755
I need stability, Ian.

27:10.755 --> 27:12.798
Oh, what the fuck?
So you're...

27:12.798 --> 27:14.675
you're not coming
and you're breaking up with me?

27:14.675 --> 27:16.927
And it's killing me,

27:16.927 --> 27:21.557
but long distance
and Skypes and holidays,

27:21.557 --> 27:22.975
whenever we can afford
a ticket,

27:22.975 --> 27:25.728
it would just be keeping us
half in something.

27:25.728 --> 27:28.939
And us...

27:28.939 --> 27:31.067
and we...

27:33.402 --> 27:36.155
I think we deserve
more than that.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.618
So chase your dream.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.831
I really hope
it works out for you.

27:51.045 --> 27:54.423
You're breaking my heart,
Camille.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.592
I'm breaking my own.

29:21.719 --> 29:24.722
[vocalizing]

29:28.601 --> 29:31.979
[sighs]

30:13.020 --> 30:16.023
[vocalizing]
