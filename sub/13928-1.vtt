WEBVTT

00:09.684 --> 00:11.652
<i>Sweets for my sweetie?</i>

00:11.653 --> 00:14.487
<i>Mmm, don't mind if I do.</i>

00:15.055 --> 00:17.558
<i>Bubbly for my bubbly?</i>

00:17.559 --> 00:20.795
<i>Uh, yeah. I don't think...
That's not a thing.</i>

00:20.796 --> 00:23.429
- You want more champagne or not?
- Of course, I do, baby.

00:28.936 --> 00:32.573
Here's to having you to myself
for the entire weekend.

00:32.573 --> 00:36.175
I'm all yours, Will.
Every inch of me.

00:41.949 --> 00:44.675
Come Monday, you won't
be able to walk straight.

00:44.676 --> 00:48.287
- I'm gonna rip you to shreds.
- I like the sound of that.

00:53.761 --> 00:55.496
<i>Yeah, I mean...</i>

00:55.497 --> 00:57.598
- What was that?
<i>- I have a conscience.</i>

00:57.599 --> 00:59.232
- It was nothing, baby.
<i>- Come on.</i>

01:02.470 --> 01:03.938
Shh!

01:03.939 --> 01:05.271
You just left the TV on.

01:05.906 --> 01:07.975
I wasn't watching TV.

01:07.976 --> 01:11.512
Oh. No.
No, come on, don't go.

01:16.517 --> 01:17.952
What if it's your husband?

01:17.953 --> 01:20.955
No way. He's in Tokyo
till Thursday.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.822
Will, it's nothing.

01:25.060 --> 01:26.292
Shit!

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:36.570 --> 01:38.939
If it is him...

01:38.940 --> 01:41.208
- Yeah?
- We could always say it was dark.

01:41.209 --> 01:43.277
And we thought
it was an intruder.

01:43.278 --> 01:45.912
An honest mistake,
self-defense, you know?

01:46.714 --> 01:47.914
Yeah.

01:51.151 --> 01:52.385
Come on.

01:55.055 --> 01:57.525
<i>Our sex tape can't be blurry.</i>

01:57.526 --> 02:00.661
<i>No, we don't wanna
leave this blurry.</i>

02:00.662 --> 02:02.061
<i>- Come on...
- I need to see you.</i>

02:03.264 --> 02:07.067
<i>I need to see everything.</i>

02:07.068 --> 02:09.268
See. Told you.

02:10.237 --> 02:12.139
Well, I didn't turn it on.

02:12.140 --> 02:14.675
Yeah, right.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.210
Perv.

02:16.211 --> 02:18.045
<i>- You're pinning me down!
- Oh!</i>

02:18.046 --> 02:19.479
<i>Oh!</i>

02:23.784 --> 02:25.753
Naughty little schoolgirl.

02:25.754 --> 02:28.088
<i>I need this too much.</i>

02:41.201 --> 02:42.441
Okay, what the hell
is going on?

02:44.238 --> 02:46.073
Somebody's fucking with us.

02:46.074 --> 02:47.373
Hello?

02:50.711 --> 02:52.512
It's just some asshole kids.

02:53.614 --> 02:55.950
I don't know.

02:55.951 --> 02:59.753
You know, my friends and I used to
always pull this crap on Mischief Night.

02:59.754 --> 03:02.289
- Didn't you?
- What the hell is Mischief Night?

03:04.826 --> 03:08.161
There they are.
Cue the bag of flaming poo.

03:11.865 --> 03:13.366
Very funny, ass...

03:15.769 --> 03:16.869
What's going on?

03:18.205 --> 03:20.273
I don't know. But I'm not
taking any chances.

03:22.843 --> 03:24.443
I'm calling the cops.

03:28.983 --> 03:30.283
- Shit.
- What?

03:31.251 --> 03:32.885
No dial tone.

03:48.302 --> 03:50.970
There's someone there.

03:55.843 --> 03:57.044
- Where's your cell phone?
- In my purse.

03:57.045 --> 03:58.244
Find it.

04:00.948 --> 04:02.282
- Find it?
- No.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.317
I swear, it was right there!

04:07.321 --> 04:09.155
- Where's yours?
- Jeans.

04:12.326 --> 04:14.194
- Not here.
- Let me look.

04:16.397 --> 04:18.332
Who the hell is it?

04:18.333 --> 04:21.735
Whoever it is, they may
still be in the house.

04:21.736 --> 04:24.438
You go hide in the closet
while I check it out.

04:24.439 --> 04:27.007
If somebody's messing with us,
they'll be sorry.

04:27.008 --> 04:28.507
No.

04:29.910 --> 04:31.345
Be careful.

04:31.346 --> 04:33.246
All right. Go.

04:47.961 --> 04:49.896
Batter's up, assholes.

04:53.267 --> 04:54.567
Hello?

05:01.075 --> 05:03.609
All right! Who wants
to get their asses kicked?

05:04.311 --> 05:05.478
Huh?

05:07.381 --> 05:08.581
Pussies.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.513
Oh, no. Come on! Come on!

07:36.597 --> 07:39.098
No! No! Come on! Come on!

07:45.939 --> 07:47.341
Oh, my God.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.707
Oh!

07:49.343 --> 07:51.078
Oh, my God!

07:51.079 --> 07:52.446
Oh, my God.

08:13.467 --> 08:14.733
No! No!

08:16.103 --> 08:18.237
Come on! Come on!

08:28.315 --> 08:29.548
Oh, fuck!

08:37.190 --> 08:38.457
Let me out of here!

10:20.694 --> 10:24.798
So, how is school?
Fine. A little boring.

10:24.799 --> 10:26.266
Staying out of trouble then?

10:26.267 --> 10:28.635
No, no.
Uh, let's see.

10:28.636 --> 10:31.071
I've been suspended twice
in the last week,

10:31.072 --> 10:33.473
I'm failing everything, getting
kicked out of all the clubs.

10:33.474 --> 10:36.510
There's this one kid's mom that's
threatening to press charges against me.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.278
Good, good!
Glad to hear it.

10:38.279 --> 10:40.599
I... I'm glad to see that
everything is on track then, huh?

10:41.815 --> 10:44.718
But seriously, it is.

10:44.719 --> 10:47.320
I mean, I'm... I'm doing
really well, Dr. Pomock.

10:47.321 --> 10:49.289
Like, it might be time for me
to lose the Lexapro.

10:49.290 --> 10:51.124
Emily...

10:51.125 --> 10:53.093
Look, I... I know
what you're going to say.

10:53.094 --> 10:55.629
You're gonna tell me that the
medication makes me feel better,

10:55.630 --> 10:58.165
and that's why I don't think
I need it anymore,

10:58.166 --> 11:00.267
even though I still do.
But in that case...

11:00.268 --> 11:02.102
When do you get
to stop taking the medication?

11:02.103 --> 11:03.269
Yeah.

11:05.272 --> 11:08.141
How about when your
eyesight returns?

11:08.142 --> 11:10.377
Well, that's a cheap shot.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.611
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean for it to be.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.683
Emily, why is it
that you can't see?

11:19.152 --> 11:21.755
Because something happened
in the accident.

11:21.756 --> 11:25.692
Some weird, like, nerve trauma,
some brain trauma, or...

11:25.693 --> 11:30.163
Or emotional trauma?
Causing conversion disorder,

11:30.164 --> 11:33.867
of which your asthma and your
blindness are active symptoms.

11:33.868 --> 11:36.403
Yeah, but maybe
that's not the case.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.606
And maybe the neurologists and the
ophthalmologists and the radiologists are...

11:39.607 --> 11:41.840
All missed something. Yes.

11:43.677 --> 11:46.745
I mean, I'm happy.

11:47.848 --> 11:51.284
I'm well-adjusted, I'm smart,

11:51.285 --> 11:53.854
I have a boyfriend,
my dad and I are super close.

11:53.855 --> 11:58.658
It's been nine years. I...
Shouldn't I be cured by now?

11:58.659 --> 12:01.660
If... If this was all in my head,
wouldn't I be able to see?

12:01.895 --> 12:04.131
Maybe it's you.

12:04.132 --> 12:06.166
Maybe you're just doing
a lousy job.

12:06.167 --> 12:09.469
I see. Well, now
who's taking the cheap shots?

12:09.470 --> 12:12.906
You know what I mean,
this whole process.

12:12.907 --> 12:16.309
You know, maybe this is something
that we need to spend more time

12:16.310 --> 12:19.746
actually talking about.

12:19.747 --> 12:22.614
You know, really coming to
terms with the idea that

12:23.416 --> 12:25.684
you may never regain
your eyesight.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.588
Well...

12:28.589 --> 12:30.290
How would you feel about that?
I mean, if...

12:30.291 --> 12:33.393
If this, what you are seeing
right now,

12:33.394 --> 12:34.914
is all you would ever see
of the world?

12:36.296 --> 12:38.398
Is that okay?

12:38.399 --> 12:41.533
Does it make you angry?
Would you blame somebody, or...

12:45.272 --> 12:47.706
I asked if you'd...
If you'd blame someone.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.243
Yeah.

12:50.244 --> 12:51.811
I'd blame myself.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.512
It's my fault.

12:55.215 --> 12:58.083
She was injured and bleeding
and asking for help.

12:59.486 --> 13:01.555
And I... I just...

13:01.556 --> 13:04.191
Emily, you were
eight years old.

13:04.192 --> 13:07.426
They found you in the snow
nearly frozen to death.

13:09.362 --> 13:10.497
You were going for help,
you said.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.732
Maybe.

13:12.733 --> 13:15.033
Maybe I was, maybe I wasn't,
who remembers?

13:18.338 --> 13:20.373
And the accident itself?

13:20.374 --> 13:21.608
What do you mean?

13:21.609 --> 13:23.577
Uh, was that your fault, too?

13:23.578 --> 13:26.378
I mean, it wasn't like you were
actually driving the car, was it? Or...

13:26.513 --> 13:27.880
Don't.

13:28.748 --> 13:31.550
So, you don't remember
what happened?

13:31.851 --> 13:33.286
No.

13:33.287 --> 13:34.086
Mmm-hmm.

13:49.402 --> 13:50.836
- Hey, kid!
- Hey, Dad.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.141
How'd it go?

14:05.518 --> 14:06.718
Seatbelt.

14:11.891 --> 14:13.927
So, how did it...

14:13.928 --> 14:16.728
Not right now, okay?

14:44.991 --> 14:47.327
Oh!

14:47.328 --> 14:49.596
You all right?
Are you all right, honey?

14:49.597 --> 14:51.064
I'm fine. What was that?

14:51.065 --> 14:53.198
It was a pothole.
I'm sorry, it was my fault.

14:54.301 --> 14:55.141
You sure you're okay?

14:55.435 --> 14:56.602
Yeah.

14:57.971 --> 14:59.738
Yeah.
I... I just hit my head.

15:00.540 --> 15:01.573
So you're good?

15:01.941 --> 15:03.275
Dad, please.

15:08.982 --> 15:11.985
<i>So, you don't</i>
<i>remember what happened?</i>

15:11.986 --> 15:13.453
<i>No.</i>

15:13.454 --> 15:14.887
Mmm-hmm.

15:16.423 --> 15:17.556
Except, you do.

15:18.091 --> 15:20.894
It's all in the police report.

15:20.895 --> 15:23.963
So then you know, and you
don't need me to tell you.

15:23.964 --> 15:27.434
No. But I need you
to tell you.

15:27.435 --> 15:29.569
Why? Why does it matter?

15:29.570 --> 15:31.270
Because...

15:33.707 --> 15:37.977
Do you honestly blame yourself
for your mother's death?

15:37.978 --> 15:41.448
I mean, are you really carrying
that weight around with you?

15:41.449 --> 15:42.782
'Cause I gotta say, if you are,

15:42.783 --> 15:45.985
it's a wonder you could stand,
let alone see.

15:45.986 --> 15:48.988
Look, I don't wanna
talk about this anymore.

15:48.989 --> 15:53.560
Well, you know, that's, uh, that's just
catnip to someone in my profession, okay?

15:53.561 --> 15:58.465
That's probably the precise thing
we should be talking about.

15:58.466 --> 16:00.832
We've been over this
and over it.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.641
You asked why you're still
on the medication,

16:08.642 --> 16:10.610
why you can't see,

16:10.611 --> 16:13.111
why you're still in therapy
after nine years.

16:13.747 --> 16:14.947
Well?

16:16.916 --> 16:18.518
You have to tell me.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.488
Oh, for God's sake!

16:21.489 --> 16:25.658
No, that's the way that it works,
kiddo, okay? You have the answer.

16:25.659 --> 16:28.395
Oh, well, then,
what's the question?

16:28.396 --> 16:31.698
Why do you blame yourself
for your mother's death?

16:31.699 --> 16:34.633
Because it was my fault!

16:36.603 --> 16:37.836
<i>Jimmy calling.</i>

16:38.972 --> 16:40.272
<i>Jimmy calling.</i>

16:41.775 --> 16:42.841
<i>Jimmy calling.</i>

16:45.412 --> 16:48.914
Hey, Jimmy. No, not yet.
I... I will soon.

16:50.817 --> 16:53.352
Tonight. I'll ask him tonight.
I... I promise.

16:54.788 --> 16:56.121
Oh. Me, too.

16:58.725 --> 17:00.527
So how's Jimmy?

17:00.528 --> 17:03.797
Oh, he's fine.
You know, he's a pain.

17:03.798 --> 17:06.465
He's really excited
because it's Mischief Night

17:06.467 --> 17:09.469
and he and his friends are going to
prank some of the guys on the JV squad.

17:09.470 --> 17:13.940
I guess it's some
annual tradition. Boys.

17:13.941 --> 17:17.777
Hey, it's what we do, right? Get tortured
and then torture others in turn.

17:17.778 --> 17:19.746
So it goes, from one
generation to the next.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.781
You did that too?

17:21.781 --> 17:24.584
Well, when we were kids, we called it
"Cabbage Night," believe it or not.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.520
We actually threw
rotten cabbages at each other.

17:27.521 --> 17:30.490
And the occasional car window.

17:30.491 --> 17:33.560
"Cabbage Night?"
God, you were a nerd.

17:33.561 --> 17:35.927
It takes one to know one, huh?

17:55.682 --> 17:57.917
Want me to make you
some dinner before I head out?

17:57.918 --> 18:00.153
Dad, I'm not 12,
I can make my own dinner.

18:00.154 --> 18:02.287
Okay, okay, just asking.

19:22.569 --> 19:24.503
Well, what do you think?
How do I look?

19:35.114 --> 19:37.183
- New sweater?
- No. No.

19:37.184 --> 19:39.852
I... I just haven't worn it
in a while.

19:39.853 --> 19:41.888
Yeah, but you're wearing
your lucky shirt.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.857
Trying to get lucky tonight, eh?

19:44.858 --> 19:47.594
It's a first date, Em.
I'll be lucky if it lasts an hour.

19:47.595 --> 19:49.829
Ah, you'll end up sleeping with
her and spending the night,

19:49.830 --> 19:52.065
and I'll be on my own.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.901
You're gonna leave me alone all by
myself in this horrifying house.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.069
We've only been here
a few months,

19:56.070 --> 19:58.071
I don't even know
my way around here yet.

19:58.072 --> 19:59.339
If it wasn't for your
constant nagging,

19:59.340 --> 20:01.007
I wouldn't be going at all.

20:01.008 --> 20:03.776
Yeah, well, thank God
for my constant nagging.

20:03.777 --> 20:05.278
The rate you're going, you'll end
up watching the Hallmark Channel,

20:05.279 --> 20:07.179
eating frozen meals for one.

20:11.784 --> 20:14.387
I... I'm sorry, Dad.
I was just kidding.

20:14.388 --> 20:16.321
No, I... I know, sweetheart.
It's just...

20:17.156 --> 20:19.024
Dating is hard.

20:19.359 --> 20:22.662
At my age...

20:22.663 --> 20:25.130
And in my condition, if
that's the right word for it?

20:28.067 --> 20:31.037
I'm still in love
with your mom.

20:31.038 --> 20:32.772
I mean, she was the love
of my life. I don't...

20:32.773 --> 20:35.842
It's been nine years.
Life goes on, right?

20:35.843 --> 20:37.509
That's what my shrink said.
Didn't yours?

20:38.878 --> 20:41.580
Yeah, he did. And it does.

20:43.916 --> 20:46.051
After all,
you're a big girl now.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.189
With a life of her own.

20:50.190 --> 20:51.290
I should get a life too, right?

20:51.291 --> 20:52.891
Mmm. Exactly.

20:54.994 --> 20:57.629
And say, she said,
spotting the perfect segue,

20:59.165 --> 21:03.301
I am a big girl,
with a life of her own, so...

21:03.870 --> 21:05.070
So what?

21:06.105 --> 21:08.007
Well, you know Jimmy?

21:08.008 --> 21:10.243
Yeah, I know Jimmy.

21:10.244 --> 21:12.644
Well, you know his dad has that
cabin up near Mount Arthur?

21:14.113 --> 21:15.247
And?

21:15.448 --> 21:16.581
And...

21:18.351 --> 21:21.921
He invited me to go up for the
weekend with him and his family

21:21.922 --> 21:23.555
and he's going to teach me
how to ski.

21:25.358 --> 21:27.860
- He's gonna what?
- Teach me how to ski.

21:27.861 --> 21:29.796
You know, that thing where
people put sticks on their feet

21:29.797 --> 21:31.731
- and roll down mountains?
- Oh, no.

21:31.732 --> 21:35.435
Oh, honey, come on now. You know,
I wanna say that's a bad idea.

21:35.436 --> 21:37.136
- Why?
- Well, because...

21:37.137 --> 21:39.739
- What, because I'm blind?
- No, don't be ridiculous.

21:39.740 --> 21:42.141
We both know blind people
do anything and...

21:42.142 --> 21:44.777
- Well, then why not?
- Well, because...

21:44.778 --> 21:45.510
Because of Jimmy?

21:46.079 --> 21:48.247
He is an idiot.

21:48.248 --> 21:50.883
Well, duh, he's an 18-year-old boy.
They're all idiots.

21:52.252 --> 21:54.954
So? Can I go?

21:56.457 --> 21:58.357
I'll be worried about you, Em.

21:58.358 --> 22:00.493
- I'm a big girl.
- No, I don't care.

22:00.494 --> 22:03.796
Look, plenty of people
with perfect vision

22:03.797 --> 22:06.265
go skiing every year
and break their necks.

22:06.266 --> 22:09.302
Even 17-year-olds, Miss Emily.

22:09.303 --> 22:11.738
Now, what if you hurt yourself?

22:11.739 --> 22:15.006
I won't hurt myself. I'm gonna
take a lesson. Start out slow.

22:15.374 --> 22:17.510
And if I'm good enough,

22:17.511 --> 22:19.412
I'll go down the easy slope with
Jimmy guiding me the whole way.

22:19.413 --> 22:22.081
Jimmy? The idiot? Right.

22:22.082 --> 22:24.884
He's been skiing since he was five.
Never broke a thing.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.754
Including a book.

22:27.755 --> 22:30.388
I promise, I can handle myself.

22:35.762 --> 22:36.594
Hey, Sharon.

22:38.097 --> 22:40.432
Yeah. I... I remember, it's
right behind the red house.

22:41.934 --> 22:45.370
I'm... I'm looking forward
to it, too. Okay. Bye.

22:48.040 --> 22:49.708
She can't wait to see you.

22:50.910 --> 22:52.310
Apparently.

22:52.945 --> 22:54.045
Cool.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.150
And? So?

23:03.189 --> 23:05.109
Fine. But please, come back
in one piece, please.

23:06.392 --> 23:08.159
You too, lover boy.

23:11.464 --> 23:12.565
I am gonna change.

23:12.566 --> 23:14.199
Yeah. Good idea.

23:39.826 --> 23:41.159
Emily?

23:42.962 --> 23:44.597
Emily? What happened?

23:44.598 --> 23:46.833
I don't know.

23:46.834 --> 23:49.168
Oh, great.

23:49.169 --> 23:50.570
Great. They're egging
the house.

23:50.571 --> 23:52.905
Right, Mischief Night.
Okay, good.

23:52.906 --> 23:55.106
Calm down, Dad, it's just
some kids messing around.

23:58.110 --> 23:59.744
Son of a bitch!

24:01.347 --> 24:03.416
- Hey!
- Oh, man!

24:03.417 --> 24:05.551
Hey!

24:09.455 --> 24:10.655
Assholes.

24:33.112 --> 24:34.632
Why the hell
would they hit this house?

24:36.649 --> 24:37.849
You okay?

24:40.119 --> 24:41.553
I gotta clean that
before it dries.

25:21.294 --> 25:22.594
Shh!

25:24.964 --> 25:26.432
You thought you could
sneak up on me.

25:26.433 --> 25:27.700
How the hell did you know?

25:27.701 --> 25:29.268
Because you smell like someone

25:29.269 --> 25:31.436
who's been playing football
for two hours.

25:35.308 --> 25:37.310
You know what I think?
I don't think you're really blind at all.

25:37.311 --> 25:38.611
I think you've been lying
this whole time.

25:38.612 --> 25:40.845
That or you're Daredevil.

25:52.024 --> 25:53.391
I wish I could see you.

25:55.261 --> 25:57.428
Trust me, you don't.
I'm hideously ugly, so...

26:02.501 --> 26:05.705
So are you ever gonna
finish unpacking?

26:05.706 --> 26:09.408
Or, like, I don't know,
like decorate a little?

26:09.409 --> 26:11.576
Decorate? You mean, like,
hang posters?

26:14.547 --> 26:17.248
Okay, when you say it
like that it sounds...

26:20.686 --> 26:23.089
Wait a minute.
Did you color your hair?

26:23.090 --> 26:24.290
Oh, Jesus, you can feel that?

26:24.291 --> 26:26.158
Yes.

26:26.159 --> 26:28.361
Yeah, me and the guys
went yesterday.

26:28.362 --> 26:30.428
God, maybe you are Daredevil.

26:32.064 --> 26:34.734
Maybe. But I prefer Batman.

26:34.735 --> 26:36.401
Or the Hulk. Smash.

26:43.676 --> 26:45.610
I don't... I don't get it.

26:47.513 --> 26:50.516
I mean, your eyes
are so beautiful, it...

26:50.517 --> 26:54.153
It just doesn't make sense.

26:54.154 --> 26:56.756
Well, the doctor says that there's
nothing actually wrong with my eyes

26:56.757 --> 26:59.257
and my vision could come back
at any time.

27:00.760 --> 27:03.662
And what do you think?

27:03.663 --> 27:06.698
I think that I'm tired of talking
about the subject for one day.

27:08.534 --> 27:11.037
Anyways, guess what?

27:11.038 --> 27:12.437
What?

27:14.240 --> 27:16.142
Who has four thumbs

27:16.143 --> 27:19.078
and are totally going to your
parents' cabin this weekend?

27:19.079 --> 27:21.080
- Wait, no kidding? No...
- Mmm-hmm. No kidding.

27:21.081 --> 27:21.879
Yes!

27:23.282 --> 27:24.683
I am getting some skis on.

27:24.684 --> 27:25.817
Oh!

27:28.821 --> 27:30.656
Emily?

27:30.657 --> 27:31.589
- Oh, shit.
- Em?

27:32.558 --> 27:33.925
Emily?

27:39.131 --> 27:40.431
Emily?

27:47.173 --> 27:48.740
Emily?

27:51.177 --> 27:52.010
Hey, Em?

27:52.812 --> 27:55.114
Oh, hey Dad.

27:55.115 --> 27:56.716
I just wanted to tell you
I'm taking off.

27:56.749 --> 27:59.385
Okay, have fun.

27:59.386 --> 28:02.455
I'm gonna lock up as I leave,
so, the key is in the spot.

28:02.456 --> 28:04.323
And what else? What?

28:04.324 --> 28:06.591
Oh, I have the cell phone,
so if you need me, call me.

28:07.526 --> 28:10.395
Dad. Dad, I'll be fine.
Just go.

28:11.430 --> 28:13.499
- Yeah?
- Yep.

28:13.500 --> 28:14.600
- Okay. I'm going.
- Have...

28:14.601 --> 28:15.833
Have fun.

29:44.323 --> 29:46.057
Oh, shit!

30:15.955 --> 30:17.021
Come on.

30:59.531 --> 31:00.798
Hello?

31:02.735 --> 31:03.935
Dad?

31:12.279 --> 31:13.678
Who's there?

31:44.477 --> 31:47.513
Find something better
to do with your time, loser!

32:04.863 --> 32:06.465
<i>What would you like to do?</i>

32:06.466 --> 32:08.667
Call Dad.

32:08.668 --> 32:09.934
<i>Dialing.</i>

32:15.074 --> 32:17.343
<i>Hey, it's David.
Please leave a message.</i>

32:17.344 --> 32:20.079
Hey, Dad.
Um, everything's fine.

32:20.080 --> 32:23.015
I was just making sure
you were having a good time.

32:23.016 --> 32:25.149
Uh, no need to call me back.
Love you.

32:28.087 --> 32:30.456
<i>What would you like to do?</i>

32:30.457 --> 32:32.124
- Call Jimmy.
<i>- Dialing.</i>

32:38.364 --> 32:39.898
<i>- Hello?
- Jimmy.</i>

32:39.899 --> 32:42.134
<i>Hey, babe.
Uh, you miss me already?</i>

32:42.135 --> 32:43.569
What are you doing?

32:43.570 --> 32:45.471
Oh, I'm... I'm just,
uh, I'm hanging with...

32:45.472 --> 32:50.876
<i>Uh, we're about to go prank some
of the freshmen, so. You okay?</i>

32:50.877 --> 32:54.446
Yeah. Everything's fine.
I was...

32:54.447 --> 32:57.683
It's just, some kids are messing
around around the house.

32:57.684 --> 32:58.883
Do you need me to come over
and kick somebody's ass?

32:59.685 --> 33:02.320
Yes. But seriously...

33:03.889 --> 33:07.459
Um, I just got scared
for a minute.

33:07.460 --> 33:11.096
<i>Look, babe, it's... It's Mischief Night,
you know? It's bound to happen, okay?</i>

33:11.097 --> 33:13.532
<i>Um, I mean God knows I've
terrorized some folks in my time.</i>

33:13.533 --> 33:16.835
<i>I mean, TPing houses,
egging people.</i>

33:16.836 --> 33:19.805
I mean... I even took... I even
took a dump in Aidan's front lawn.

33:19.806 --> 33:21.807
Do you remember Aidan?

33:21.808 --> 33:24.410
Yeah, you two
were best friends for a while.

33:24.411 --> 33:26.412
Yeah, not after that.

33:26.413 --> 33:28.614
I don't know, I don't know.
People really hold a grudge.

33:29.149 --> 33:30.615
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

33:31.850 --> 33:33.619
You know what I'm gonna do?

33:33.620 --> 33:37.623
I'm gonna take a nice
hot shower and get in bed.

33:37.624 --> 33:41.560
Nice hot shower, huh? Uh, you, uh,
you got room for me in there?

33:41.561 --> 33:42.727
<i>Sure.</i>

33:44.096 --> 33:45.816
Then my dad's gonna come home
and shoot you.

33:46.765 --> 33:48.766
Yeah, well,
it might be worth dying for.

33:49.201 --> 33:51.168
Mmm, dream on.

33:52.838 --> 33:54.305
All right, bye.

34:59.171 --> 35:02.875
Okay. It's just
some dumb kids. That's all.

35:02.876 --> 35:05.677
Just some dumb kids, and you're not
gonna let them freak you out, okay?

35:05.678 --> 35:07.279
How do you expect to go skiing

35:07.280 --> 35:09.047
if you can't even handle
some kids throwing eggs?

35:09.048 --> 35:10.948
You can't. So quit it.

35:23.863 --> 35:28.667
<i>- I can take care of those two.
- I don't know. I don't know!</i>

35:28.668 --> 35:30.035
<i>I know you're afraid, but we...</i>

35:30.036 --> 35:32.336
<i>I don't know!
I don't know!</i>

35:33.605 --> 35:35.774
<i>What's happening?</i>

36:44.376 --> 36:46.745
<i>Lauren calling.</i>

36:46.746 --> 36:48.245
<i>Lauren calling.</i>

36:49.915 --> 36:53.250
<i>Lauren calling.
Lauren calling.</i>

36:55.621 --> 36:58.355
<i>Lauren calling. Lauren...</i>

36:59.925 --> 37:01.026
Hey!

37:01.027 --> 37:03.095
Hey Em, how you doing?

37:03.096 --> 37:06.096
<i>- I'm good.
- Uh, is my brother on his date?</i>

37:06.398 --> 37:09.635
Amazingly.

37:09.636 --> 37:13.972
You know what that is. That is, uh, one
giant leap for mankind, right there.

37:13.973 --> 37:15.307
He should've done this
a long time ago.

37:15.308 --> 37:17.142
<i>Mmm. Yep.</i>

37:17.143 --> 37:19.378
So, listen, I'm...
I'm gonna stop by.

37:19.379 --> 37:21.113
<i>Okay, what's up?</i>

37:21.114 --> 37:24.783
Uh, well, you know that costume
you wore in first grade?

37:24.784 --> 37:26.652
<i>- Uh, the rag doll?
- Mmm-hmm?</i>

37:26.653 --> 37:29.154
<i>Wouldn't Caroline
look adorable in that?</i>

37:29.155 --> 37:32.424
I, uh, mentioned it to her
and she wants to wear it.

37:32.425 --> 37:35.727
You know, so she can be
like her big cousin, Em.

37:35.728 --> 37:38.230
Aw, that sounds sweet.

37:38.231 --> 37:40.065
I'll see if I can find it.

37:40.066 --> 37:43.769
All right, and I'll stop by in
about 15 minutes to help you look.

37:43.770 --> 37:45.903
- Okay. See you soon.
<i>- Bye-bye, honey.</i>

37:52.444 --> 37:53.644
Ouch!

40:40.946 --> 40:42.246
Emily?

40:51.857 --> 40:53.123
Emily?

41:14.145 --> 41:15.412
Emily!

41:41.306 --> 41:44.109
Found it!

41:44.110 --> 41:48.914
Oh, my gosh!
Didn't you hear me calling you?

41:48.915 --> 41:51.449
All right, you almost gave me
half a heart attack.

41:51.450 --> 41:52.684
Well, it's Mischief
Night, auntie, dear.

41:52.685 --> 41:54.152
I'm supposed
to scare you to death.

41:54.153 --> 41:56.054
Well, you did.

41:56.055 --> 41:57.354
Oh, my God.

41:58.590 --> 42:02.594
This is more adorable
than I even remember.

42:02.595 --> 42:05.662
- Thanks so much for finding it for me.
- Oh, you're welcome.

42:06.431 --> 42:09.501
So, tell me.

42:09.502 --> 42:14.439
Your dad is on his first date
since the Cretaceous Period.

42:14.440 --> 42:17.442
- Yeah.
- And who is the lucky lady?

42:17.443 --> 42:20.645
Well, her name is Miss
Sharon Balkin.

42:20.646 --> 42:22.514
She was my old math teacher.
I set it up.

42:22.515 --> 42:24.049
Ah.

42:24.050 --> 42:27.152
- Nice job!
- Thank you.

42:27.153 --> 42:28.886
Did she pick him up?
I saw his car.

42:30.121 --> 42:33.959
- Um, I guess so.
- Mmm.

42:33.960 --> 42:37.429
Oh, and I was gonna ask you, um, what
about that weekend at Jimmy's cabin?

42:37.430 --> 42:40.198
Oh, yeah, I got the nod.

42:40.199 --> 42:41.232
- You did?
- Mmm-hmm.

42:41.233 --> 42:44.102
- I knew he would cave!
- I know.

42:44.103 --> 42:46.829
You are working it, girl.
You are working it.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.606
Thank you. I am so excited.

42:48.607 --> 42:51.676
Oh, well, I want to thank you
so much for getting this

42:51.677 --> 42:53.311
- for me and Carol.
- Oh, sure.

42:53.312 --> 42:55.347
Tell her...
Tell Carol I love her.

42:55.348 --> 42:57.115
I will. We love you,
too, sweetheart.

42:57.116 --> 42:59.150
- Love you two more!
- All right, I gotta go.

42:59.151 --> 42:59.718
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

42:59.719 --> 43:00.918
Bye!

43:33.618 --> 43:34.751
Oh.

43:41.726 --> 43:43.660
Oh, Emily. I forgot.

43:51.369 --> 43:54.039
Emily? Make sure you don't
leave the door open.

43:54.040 --> 43:55.706
Your father will kill...

44:01.413 --> 44:02.846
Lauren?

44:04.482 --> 44:06.583
Did you say the door was open?

44:08.586 --> 44:10.454
Lauren, did you leave?

44:11.489 --> 44:12.756
Lauren?

44:14.626 --> 44:15.926
Hello?

44:20.632 --> 44:21.999
Lauren?

44:50.462 --> 44:51.762
Lauren?

44:56.768 --> 44:58.035
Lauren.

45:01.840 --> 45:02.906
Oh. Okay. Good.

45:08.813 --> 45:10.681
Lauren, you leave?

45:13.585 --> 45:15.819
Uh, I'm calling you
just to be sure.

45:27.732 --> 45:29.433
What the...

46:03.468 --> 46:06.437
Just calm down.
You're okay.

46:06.438 --> 46:08.705
There's... There's
an explanation for this.

46:10.475 --> 46:12.843
The phone's somewhere.
Just think. Okay.

46:14.212 --> 46:15.979
Okay. What were you doing?

46:17.448 --> 46:18.882
Coffee table.

46:42.607 --> 46:43.874
Hello?

46:49.981 --> 46:51.950
<i>- Lauren calling.
- Geez.</i>

46:51.951 --> 46:53.617
<i>Lauren calling.</i>

46:54.852 --> 46:56.553
<i>Lauren calling.</i>

46:57.622 --> 46:59.122
<i>Lauren calling.</i>

47:00.291 --> 47:01.658
<i>-Lauren...</i>

47:05.530 --> 47:07.030
Hello? Lauren?

47:13.538 --> 47:14.905
Hello?

47:46.671 --> 47:48.939
Get away from me!
Just get away!

47:53.544 --> 47:56.384
What... What do you want? You want to
scare me? 'Cause I'm scared, okay?

48:00.551 --> 48:02.252
Just get away from me!

48:06.791 --> 48:08.258
Get away from me!

48:10.395 --> 48:12.530
Get away from me, please!
Just get away, please!

48:19.604 --> 48:21.705
Just get away from me!

48:43.094 --> 48:45.596
Shit. No, no, no.

48:45.597 --> 48:48.164
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

49:12.457 --> 49:13.657
Okay, just breathe.

49:15.059 --> 49:16.960
Just breathe,
just breathe, just breathe.

49:20.532 --> 49:22.600
- You miss me that much?
- Oh, Jimmy. Thank God!

49:22.601 --> 49:26.070
Hey, what's wrong?
Hey. Hey, what's wrong?

49:26.071 --> 49:28.840
There's...
There's someone here.

49:28.841 --> 49:32.043
- What do you mean?
- There's someone in the house right now.

49:32.044 --> 49:33.945
What? Are you sure?

49:33.946 --> 49:36.881
Yeah! I could... I could hear him.
I could hear him breathing.

49:36.882 --> 49:38.816
Hey, hey. It's just nerves.

49:38.817 --> 49:41.419
No, it's not! No, it's not!
You have to listen to me.

49:41.420 --> 49:44.722
I know where I left my phone and
it's... It's not there anymore.

49:44.723 --> 49:47.458
Somebody moved it.
You have to believe me!

49:47.459 --> 49:50.928
Okay. Hey, hey, hey! Okay, okay,
okay, I do. I do. I believe you.

49:50.929 --> 49:52.063
All right? But I need you to
breathe for me, all right?

49:52.064 --> 49:53.964
Calm down and breathe.

49:56.402 --> 49:59.637
Shh. It's okay.

49:59.638 --> 50:04.007
Wait, Lauren was here. I... I swear
I never heard her car leave.

50:04.909 --> 50:07.445
Are you sure?

50:07.446 --> 50:11.482
I never heard her car leave. Where's your
cell phone? We have to call the police.

50:11.483 --> 50:13.117
I can't. It's dead.

50:13.118 --> 50:14.752
Damn it. I...
I tried the landline.

50:14.753 --> 50:16.386
But there's...
There's no dial tone.

50:19.557 --> 50:21.759
That's weird.
Where's your cell?

50:21.760 --> 50:24.695
I don't know, I dropped it
and I think it broke.

50:24.696 --> 50:26.998
We have to get out of here.
I can't be here. Don't leave me.

50:26.999 --> 50:29.000
- Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey. Hey!
- I wanna leave right now.

50:29.001 --> 50:31.602
- I need you to calm down.
- I'll calm down when we get out of here!

50:31.603 --> 50:33.336
All right. We'll go. Okay?

50:35.740 --> 50:37.041
But wait.
What if he's out there?

50:37.042 --> 50:38.975
I don't...
I don't know what to do.

50:40.044 --> 50:42.814
Uh...

50:42.815 --> 50:45.817
All right, look. Here's what we're gonna
do, okay? Let me borrow this knife.

50:45.818 --> 50:48.052
All right, I'll borrow
your knife.

50:48.053 --> 50:50.955
I'll go out first, I'll check to see if
the coast is clear and then we'll go.

50:50.956 --> 50:52.857
All right?

50:52.858 --> 50:56.393
But I need you to take a couple of
deep breaths for me first, Em, okay?

50:57.728 --> 51:00.697
There you go.
There you go. Okay.

51:01.833 --> 51:03.935
Wait, don't leave me here.

51:03.936 --> 51:07.205
All right, we'll go together.
All right?

51:07.206 --> 51:10.974
Hey, everything's gonna
be fine, okay? I promise.

51:58.223 --> 52:00.457
Cool. What's the deal in here?

52:01.859 --> 52:04.194
My dad doesn't like me
coming in here.

52:05.763 --> 52:08.064
This is where he keeps
my mom's stuff.

52:09.200 --> 52:10.366
Wow.

52:11.702 --> 52:14.037
She's pretty.
Uh, is this your mom?

52:16.674 --> 52:19.776
Just leave it. Just leave it.
Let's just leave everything.

52:24.749 --> 52:27.083
I don't think anybody's
in here anyway.

52:46.337 --> 52:48.438
There's blood here, Emily.

52:49.974 --> 52:52.143
And there's glass everywhere.

52:52.144 --> 52:53.811
Oh, it's me.
I... I cut my foot.

52:53.812 --> 52:55.880
The smoke detector went off.

52:55.881 --> 52:58.148
- And I knocked...
- Whoa, Emily, come here, let me see.

53:00.184 --> 53:03.220
This is a pretty nasty cut, Em.

53:03.221 --> 53:05.222
Look, we're gonna have to put
something on that, okay?

53:05.223 --> 53:08.225
Just wait here a second, all right?
I'm gonna go get some gauze and tape.

53:08.226 --> 53:09.927
No, no, no.
Don't leave me here.

53:09.928 --> 53:11.961
Hey, I'll be right back,
all right?

53:13.998 --> 53:16.968
I'm telling you, Jimmy, there's
something wrong in here.

53:16.969 --> 53:18.001
Hey.

53:21.872 --> 53:24.474
I'm gonna fix your foot up
and then we're gonna go, okay?

53:39.090 --> 53:40.456
Jimmy, did you find it?

53:42.293 --> 53:43.560
Jimmy?

53:46.831 --> 53:48.131
Jimmy?

53:49.266 --> 53:51.135
Jimmy, this isn't funny!

53:51.136 --> 53:52.836
There you are.

53:58.776 --> 54:00.276
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

54:03.180 --> 54:04.914
Jimmy?

54:24.168 --> 54:25.201
No!

55:43.247 --> 55:44.380
<i>What would you like to do?</i>

55:44.749 --> 55:46.751
Police.

55:46.752 --> 55:48.986
<i>Did you say, "Call Dad"?</i>

55:48.987 --> 55:51.554
- Call police.
<i>- Home or cell?</i>

55:52.890 --> 55:54.157
Call 911.

55:55.392 --> 55:57.193
<i>Did you say, "Call Dad"?</i>

55:57.828 --> 55:59.295
Okay, call Dad.

56:03.968 --> 56:04.968
Call Dad.

56:08.539 --> 56:11.574
Come on! Come on, come on!
Please work! Please! Come on!

56:12.376 --> 56:13.609
Call Dad!

56:14.445 --> 56:15.645
Damn it!

56:20.918 --> 56:23.252
<i>Incoming call. Incoming..</i>

56:25.790 --> 56:29.226
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Emily? Can you hear me?</i>

56:29.227 --> 56:31.295
<i>- There's a bad connection.
- Sharon? Sharon, can you hear me?</i>

56:31.296 --> 56:33.197
<i>- I hope you can hear me.
- Sharon, can you hear me? I need help.</i>

56:33.198 --> 56:37.268
- Please, please hear me!
<i>- Uh...</i>

56:37.269 --> 56:39.069
<i>He didn't show up for
our date tonight,</i>

56:39.070 --> 56:41.038
<i>so I figured something
must be wrong.</i>

56:41.039 --> 56:44.175
<i>I don't think he'd stand
me up without calling.</i>

56:44.176 --> 56:46.143
<i>- Yeah, I tried his phone.
- What do you mean he didn't show up?</i>

56:46.144 --> 56:47.945
<i>And it goes straight to voicemail.</i>

56:47.946 --> 56:50.915
<i>So I don't know if
you're hearing this,</i>

56:50.916 --> 56:55.584
<i>but please do me a favor and call
me later. Um, thanks. Bye.</i>

57:02.059 --> 57:04.929
Call Dad.

57:04.930 --> 57:08.098
<i>- Did you say, "Call Dad?
- Yes. Dad.</i>

57:08.099 --> 57:10.601
<i>- Home or cell?
- Cell.</i>

57:10.602 --> 57:14.365
<i>Sorry I did not get that.
Did you say "home" or "cell"?</i>

57:14.391 --> 57:15.306
<i>Cell!</i>

57:15.307 --> 57:16.572
<i>Dialing.</i>

58:27.611 --> 58:29.079
<i>What would you like to do?</i>

58:29.080 --> 58:30.847
Call Dad.

58:31.515 --> 58:34.051
<i>- Home or cell?
- Cell.</i>

58:34.052 --> 58:35.319
<i>Dialing.</i>

59:09.153 --> 59:12.056
<i>Hey, it's David.
Please leave a message.</i>

59:12.057 --> 59:14.190
Dad?

59:23.067 --> 59:25.468
Dad?

59:34.011 --> 59:35.211
Dad?

59:46.190 --> 59:48.224
Dad? Daddy?

59:50.728 --> 59:54.531
Oh! Oh, my God. Thank God!
Emily, you're all right.

59:54.532 --> 59:57.412
Can you get my hands? He's taped my
hands. Can you get that and use that?

59:59.403 --> 01:00:01.271
Oh!

01:00:01.272 --> 01:00:04.441
Thank God! Oh, my God!
Thank God you're all right.

01:00:04.442 --> 01:00:07.044
Dad. There's someone
in the house.

01:00:07.045 --> 01:00:09.445
He's still...

01:00:12.616 --> 01:00:17.421
He hit me as I was leaving.
And he... God! He knocked me out!

01:00:17.422 --> 01:00:18.041
Who would do this?

01:00:18.067 --> 01:00:19.656
I don't know, but we
gotta get out of here.

01:00:19.657 --> 01:00:21.225
He's still here. Come on.

01:00:21.226 --> 01:00:22.692
Easy, easy.

01:00:53.524 --> 01:00:54.857
Wait here.

01:01:18.482 --> 01:01:20.250
- What's happening?
- He's just outside.

01:01:38.735 --> 01:01:40.036
Come on.

01:02:08.632 --> 01:02:10.032
Are you okay?

01:02:11.869 --> 01:02:13.536
What happened?

01:02:18.642 --> 01:02:20.444
I think I hit him.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:21.877
Are you sure?

01:02:25.883 --> 01:02:27.416
Stay here.

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.975
It's okay, come on.
We're getting out of here.

01:03:39.289 --> 01:03:40.757
Is he dead?

01:03:40.758 --> 01:03:43.460
I don't know,
but I definitely got him.

01:03:43.461 --> 01:03:45.661
I think he ran out. Come on.

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:47.830
Easy.

01:03:59.509 --> 01:04:00.810
Is he gone?

01:04:03.513 --> 01:04:04.780
I think so.

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:08.885
Is Lauren here?

01:04:08.886 --> 01:04:12.256
Well, she was,
like, an hour ago.

01:04:12.257 --> 01:04:14.056
- Her car is still out front.
- What?

01:04:15.592 --> 01:04:17.728
Damn it! They got my phone
and my keys.

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:18.695
Yeah, they cut
the landline too.

01:04:18.696 --> 01:04:19.695
What about your cell?

01:04:23.367 --> 01:04:25.568
Come on. Damn it, it's dead!

01:04:27.571 --> 01:04:30.807
All right, listen to me.
Listen to me, Emily.

01:04:30.808 --> 01:04:33.443
I need to go out there
and see if your aunt's okay.

01:04:33.444 --> 01:04:35.946
I want you to stay here
and lock the door behind me.

01:04:35.947 --> 01:04:38.615
- No!
- I'll be right back.

01:04:38.616 --> 01:04:40.984
No, this is a bad idea.
Let me come with you.

01:04:40.985 --> 01:04:44.720
Honey, it'll be much faster if I run
out there and come right back, okay?

01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:46.690
Please?

01:04:46.691 --> 01:04:48.558
Promise me you'll come back.

01:04:48.559 --> 01:04:50.726
I promise.
Lock up behind me now.

01:05:22.025 --> 01:05:23.125
Lauren!

01:05:44.881 --> 01:05:46.682
Dad, what's going on?

01:05:56.393 --> 01:05:57.293
Lauren!

01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:01.531
Lauren!

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.173
Dad!

01:06:28.525 --> 01:06:29.793
Emily, it's me.

01:06:32.629 --> 01:06:33.796
What happened?

01:06:34.898 --> 01:06:36.099
Lauren's car.

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.166
What about it?

01:06:38.769 --> 01:06:41.471
- Somebody drove off in it.
- Oh, my God!

01:06:41.472 --> 01:06:44.508
- No, no, no, he's gone, honey. He's gone.
- But where's Lauren?

01:06:44.509 --> 01:06:46.476
- I... I don't know.
- Well, what are we going to do?

01:06:46.477 --> 01:06:47.978
Look, we gotta get some help.

01:06:47.979 --> 01:06:50.414
We... We could run to the
Garson's, they're probably home.

01:06:50.415 --> 01:06:53.450
Well, maybe, but I don't want to take
you out there until I know it's safe.

01:06:53.451 --> 01:06:54.691
Well, I don't
want to stay here!

01:06:55.185 --> 01:06:58.054
Oh, God!
Dad!

01:06:58.055 --> 01:07:00.255
What do you want?
You want money, is that it?

01:07:11.168 --> 01:07:13.002
Stay here.

01:07:27.551 --> 01:07:29.920
No! No! No! No! No!

01:07:35.659 --> 01:07:37.060
Run, Emily, run!

01:08:05.956 --> 01:08:07.423
No, no!

01:08:09.926 --> 01:08:11.060
Dad!

01:08:30.779 --> 01:08:31.779
Oh, my God!

01:08:32.682 --> 01:08:34.951
Oh, no!

01:08:34.952 --> 01:08:38.754
Oh, Jimmy! Oh, Jimmy!
Oh, my God!

01:08:39.055 --> 01:08:40.354
Jimmy!

01:08:41.057 --> 01:08:43.125
Oh! Oh!

01:08:51.033 --> 01:08:52.334
Lauren?

01:09:01.278 --> 01:09:02.810
Oh.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:33.710
<i>No, I'll tell you
what the problem is.</i>

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:35.011
<i>The problem is, you got a
guy in the White House</i>

01:09:35.011 --> 01:09:37.112
<i>who thinks the Constitution...</i>

01:09:40.283 --> 01:09:42.719
Holy crap!

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:43.853
<i>- Who cares? Who cares?
- Fourth Amendment?</i>

01:09:43.854 --> 01:09:45.520
<i>Trample all over it. Easy.</i>

01:09:47.959 --> 01:09:50.727
- Please, you have to help me! Please!
- What are you doing?

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:54.096
No, there's somebody... There's...
Somebody's trying to kill us!

01:09:54.098 --> 01:09:55.365
Where? Wait, let's get
you out of here!

01:09:55.366 --> 01:09:57.968
- Come on!
- No, no, wait. Wait. No, no, no, no!

01:09:57.969 --> 01:10:01.071
My... My daddy's still inside!
Please, you have to help me!

01:10:01.072 --> 01:10:04.240
That's... That's okay.
I have a radio in the truck.

01:10:04.241 --> 01:10:06.408
We'll call the police.
Just get inside.

01:10:08.078 --> 01:10:09.378
Holy crap!

01:10:19.856 --> 01:10:20.923
Hello?

01:10:34.904 --> 01:10:36.873
Hello?

01:10:36.874 --> 01:10:39.109
Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?

01:10:43.079 --> 01:10:44.414
Hello, is anybody there?

01:10:44.415 --> 01:10:46.783
Please, please!
I need help! Please, hear me!

01:10:46.784 --> 01:10:49.285
Please, please, please,
is anybody there?

01:10:49.286 --> 01:10:52.122
<i>Uh, hey, could you...
Could you repeat your message?</i>

01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:54.090
I... I need help!
There's somebody...

01:10:54.091 --> 01:10:57.193
He... He broke into my house
and he's trying to kill us!

01:10:57.194 --> 01:10:59.729
<i>Is this for real?
Who am I talking to?</i>

01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:02.232
Yes! My... My name
is Emily Walton.

01:11:02.233 --> 01:11:04.968
And I'm calling from a
truck outside of my house.

01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:08.838
Somebody's trying to kill us.
Please, please, we need help.

01:11:08.839 --> 01:11:11.374
<i>Girl, if you're messing around on
Mischief Night, it's not funny.</i>

01:11:11.375 --> 01:11:13.375
No, I'm not. I swear.

01:11:15.779 --> 01:11:18.213
I swear. Just, please.
Please, sir, please.

01:11:19.916 --> 01:11:21.818
I need your help.

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:23.787
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

01:11:23.788 --> 01:11:26.022
Just call the police.

01:11:26.023 --> 01:11:27.263
Call the police
and tell them...

01:11:29.393 --> 01:11:31.428
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:11:31.429 --> 01:11:33.396
Please,
just call the police and...

01:11:33.397 --> 01:11:37.367
And tell them
to come to 516 Dunn Lane.

01:11:37.368 --> 01:11:39.803
<i>You're breaking up,
can you repeat that?</i>

01:11:39.804 --> 01:11:41.904
516 Dunn Lane, please hurry!

01:12:06.362 --> 01:12:08.231
Honey, it's me. It's me.

01:12:08.232 --> 01:12:10.967
It's okay. It's me.

01:12:10.968 --> 01:12:12.736
He... He's right behind me!
We have to get back in the house!

01:12:12.737 --> 01:12:14.403
Who? I don't see anyone.

01:12:16.272 --> 01:12:17.907
He was...
He was right behind me.

01:12:17.908 --> 01:12:20.310
There was this truck driver
that stopped for me,

01:12:20.311 --> 01:12:22.144
but they... They killed him!

01:12:22.946 --> 01:12:24.481
How many?

01:12:24.482 --> 01:12:27.283
I don't know.
I think just one.

01:12:27.284 --> 01:12:29.018
And there's a truck up there?

01:12:29.019 --> 01:12:30.787
Yeah, maybe we can get away.

01:12:30.788 --> 01:12:33.022
Well, yeah, but...
If the keys are still in it.

01:12:33.023 --> 01:12:35.225
But listen, we got to...

01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:37.227
We got to go back to the house.

01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:40.230
Listen, I'm out of bullets.
And I don't want to go up there,

01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:42.398
in case anyone's up there,
without bullets, all right?

01:12:42.399 --> 01:12:44.467
So we've got to go back to
the house, all right?

01:12:44.468 --> 01:12:46.136
I'm going to hide you
in the garage,

01:12:46.137 --> 01:12:47.904
and I'll only be a minute,

01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:49.738
and then we'll go
get that truck, okay?

01:12:52.976 --> 01:12:54.944
I'd rather come with you.

01:12:54.945 --> 01:12:57.312
No, I think it's safer
if you stay here.

01:13:01.985 --> 01:13:05.687
I'll be quick. But I need you
to stay right here, all right?

01:13:07.957 --> 01:13:10.226
I love you, Daddy.

01:13:10.227 --> 01:13:12.427
And I love you too, honey.

01:13:54.137 --> 01:13:55.470
Ow!

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.340
Oh!

01:15:09.212 --> 01:15:11.346
Come on in, you son of a bitch.

01:16:14.477 --> 01:16:15.944
Em...

01:16:17.347 --> 01:16:18.348
Help me.

01:16:18.349 --> 01:16:23.652
<i>Sometimes things happen
that are simply out of our control.</i>

01:16:25.321 --> 01:16:27.389
Sometimes it isn't
anybody's fault.

01:16:29.659 --> 01:16:34.630
You were in the backseat.
Your mother was driving.

01:16:34.631 --> 01:16:38.034
What could you
possibly have done to help?

01:16:38.035 --> 01:16:39.935
What could anyone
have done to help?

01:16:59.756 --> 01:17:00.822
No!

01:17:02.759 --> 01:17:04.426
Em...

01:17:05.695 --> 01:17:07.295
You were in the backseat.

01:17:13.202 --> 01:17:14.869
Your mother was driving.

01:17:17.774 --> 01:17:19.374
She was texting.

01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:21.676
What was that?

01:17:26.182 --> 01:17:27.616
She was texting.

01:17:29.452 --> 01:17:31.553
She wasn't watching the road.

01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:35.457
And she slammed
right into that truck.

01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:41.730
And she...

01:17:42.698 --> 01:17:44.733
She... She shouldn't have...

01:17:47.537 --> 01:17:49.337
She should've been watching.

01:17:51.407 --> 01:17:53.041
I love you.

01:17:55.478 --> 01:17:56.778
I'm sorry.

01:18:36.552 --> 01:18:38.154
Why?

01:18:38.155 --> 01:18:39.754
Why are you doing this?

01:18:42.725 --> 01:18:44.392
Say something.

01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:48.797
It's Mischief Night.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.101
Dad!

01:21:41.637 --> 01:21:42.937
Shh, shh, shh.

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:46.509
It's me, it's me.

01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:48.044
You've got to find
that gun, Emily.

01:21:48.045 --> 01:21:50.085
It's right by the front door.
You've got to find it.

01:23:02.485 --> 01:23:03.918
I got him, Daddy.

01:23:16.832 --> 01:23:17.932
Oh!

01:23:19.502 --> 01:23:21.970
Oh, I love you.
Oh, I love you.

01:23:23.072 --> 01:23:24.372
I love you.

01:23:25.574 --> 01:23:26.674
I love you.
