WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:03.167
ROSSI: PREVIOUSLY
ON "CRIMINAL MINDS"...

00:03.200 --> 00:04.189
GOOD EVENING, AGENT JAREAU.

00:04.230 --> 00:06.095
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
BARN ES.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.391
I'M SORRY FOR
THE SUDDEN URGENCY
IN HAVING TO MEET TONIGHT.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.135
HOWEVER, EFFECTIVE
IMMEDIATELY,

00:09.170 --> 00:12.071
SSA EMILY PRENTISS WILL BE
PLACED ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE

00:12.110 --> 00:14.032
PENDING AN INTERNAL REVIEW.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.377
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE.

00:15.410 --> 00:18.049
I HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED
FROM ACTIVE DUTY.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.308
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:19.350 --> 00:21.079
FOR HOW LONG?

00:21.120 --> 00:22.542
INDEFINITELY.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.081
JJ WILL CONTINUE BEING
ACTING UNIT CHIEF,

00:25.120 --> 00:28.510
BUT AS OF TODAY,
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
LINDA BARNES

00:28.560 --> 00:31.051
WILL BE PERSONALLY
OVERSEEING THE UNIT.

00:31.090 --> 00:33.149
ARE WE UNDER
INVESTIGATION?

00:33.200 --> 00:35.350
YES, WE ARE
UNDER INVESTIGATION.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.243
COME IN.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.814
I DON'T WANT TO BE
UNIT CHIEF,

00:57.850 --> 00:59.386
NOT LIKE THIS.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.752
I'VE BEEN IN YOUR SHOES.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.189
AND FOR LACK
OF A BETTER WORD,

01:10.230 --> 01:11.788
IT SUCKS.

01:11.830 --> 01:14.230
BUT YOU'RE GONNA DO
JUST FINE.

01:14.270 --> 01:18.468
LINDA BARNES WILL TRY TO
PICK US APART ONE BY ONE.

01:18.510 --> 01:20.137
THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE
TRYING TO PICK US APART

01:20.180 --> 01:21.579
SINCE THE DOORS OPENED.

01:21.610 --> 01:23.202
IT HASN'T WORKED YET.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.741
BUT BARNES HAS SUPPORT
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP.

01:25.780 --> 01:30.114
LOOK, DAVE, I'M STILL TRYING TO
FIGURE A WAY TO GO AFI'ER HER.

01:30.150 --> 01:33.153
AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO
IT BY BEING THE BEST
SOLDIER YOU CAN BE.

01:33.190 --> 01:34.851
DON'T ROCK THE BOAT.
DON'T MAKE WAVES.

01:34.890 --> 01:37.450
MY GUESS IS THAT'S HOW
SHE FORCED OUT EMILY.

01:37.490 --> 01:39.720
AND YOU WON'T BE ALONE
ON THIS.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.853
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE
TO DO WHAT WE DO BEST--

01:41.900 --> 01:43.788
WORK THE CASES,
SAVE LIVES.

01:43.830 --> 01:46.435
NO ONE CAN ARGUE
WITH OUR RESULTS,

01:46.470 --> 01:49.667
NOT EVEN BARN ES.

01:49.710 --> 01:52.133
THAT'S ONE HELL
OF A RALLY SPEECH.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.807
THEY ARE MY SPECIALTY.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.900
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
GO HOME, GET SOME REST?

01:56.950 --> 01:59.669
IT'S BEEN A ROUGH NIGHT
FOR ALL OF US.

02:01.250 --> 02:05.209
CAN'T GET ANY WORSE.

02:23.870 --> 02:25.906
WHOO! PIZZA, PIZZA.

02:25.940 --> 02:27.874
THAN KS, RAY.
I'M STARVING.

02:27.910 --> 02:29.707
ME, TOO.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.149
DO I SMELL...

02:32.750 --> 02:35.719
OH, COME ON, MAN, YOU
KNOW I HATE PEPPERONI.

02:35.750 --> 02:36.819
BUT THE THREE OF US LIKE IT.

02:36.850 --> 02:39.717
MAJORITY WINS.
HOUSE RULES, BROTHER.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.228
COME OVER TO
THE DARK SIDE, CHARLIE.

02:42.260 --> 02:43.818
LEARN TO LOVE PORK.

02:43.860 --> 02:46.226
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T,

02:46.260 --> 02:47.625
BUT IT'S AN ARTERY
CLOGGER, OK?

02:47.660 --> 02:49.491
OH, TOTALLY WORTH THE RISK!

02:49.530 --> 02:50.519
MM-HMM.

02:50.570 --> 02:54.688
MMM!MMM-MMM-MMM
MMM-MMM-MMM!

02:54.740 --> 02:57.709
MMM! MMMM!

02:57.740 --> 02:58.866
MM-HMM.

03:00.010 --> 03:01.375
OHH. OH, MAN.

03:01.410 --> 03:02.672
RAY: THAT'S GREAT.

03:02.710 --> 03:03.938
DOES ANYBODY NEED ANYTHING
FROM THE KITCHEN?

03:03.980 --> 03:05.299
PLATES

03:05.350 --> 03:06.874
NO, THANKS.
HOT SAUCE, PLEASE.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.740
OH! MMM!
YOU GOT IT.

03:08.780 --> 03:09.917
THAN KS, RAY.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.212
REAL GOOD.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.581
HA HA!
OH, BOY.

03:12.620 --> 03:16.283
[IN DISTINCT CHATTER,
SONG CONTINUES]

03:22.670 --> 03:24.922
NAPKINS, TOO.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.806
ALL RIGHT. HOT SAUCE
COMING RIGHT UP.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.501
WOMAN: RAY! OHH!

03:35.940 --> 03:36.679
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO THIS, MAN.

03:36.710 --> 03:38.803
MAN: TIE THEM UP, RAY.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.651
LAST NIGHT IN ST LOUIS,

03:47.690 --> 03:50.329
4 ROOMMATES WERE KILLED
IN A RENTAL HOME

03:50.360 --> 03:54.456
IN WHAT POLICE ARE CALLING
A ROBBERY TURNED HOMICIDE.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.524
ALVEZ: IT'S BRUTAL.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.766
SIMMONS: YEAH. LOOKS LIKE
THE TWO SIDES OF HIS BRAIN

03:56.800 --> 03:58.563
WERE FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.931
LEFT SIDE WANTED
TO ROB THE PLACE,

03:59.970 --> 04:01.892
THE RIGHT SIDE WANTED
TO CAUSE SOME DESTRUCTION.

04:01.940 --> 04:04.408
YEAH, BUT BOTH SIDES GOT
EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.702
WHAT WAS TAKEN?

04:05.740 --> 04:07.605
NOTHING TRACEABLE.
A COMPUTER, TABLETS,

04:07.640 --> 04:08.868
CASH, JEWELRY, AND THE LIKE.

04:08.910 --> 04:10.639
HOW LONG WAS IT BEFORE
LOCAL PD CALLED US IN?

04:10.680 --> 04:13.342
THEY DIDN'T.
I CALLED AND OFFERED
OUR SERVICES TO THEM,

04:13.380 --> 04:16.986
BECAUSE THIS IS EXACTLY
THE KIND OF CASE THE BAU
TAKES FROM HERE ON.

04:17.020 --> 04:18.681
MAYBE IT'S JUST ME,
BUT I NEED A LITTLE HELP

04:18.720 --> 04:22.656
UNDERSTANDING OUR NEW
CASE SELECTION CRITERIA.

04:22.690 --> 04:24.351
WE WANT CASES
WITH GOOD OPTICS

04:24.390 --> 04:25.687
THAT ARE ALSO QUICK
AND EASY TO CLEAR.

04:25.730 --> 04:27.049
HERE WE HAVE 4 VICTIMS,

04:27.100 --> 04:28.692
YOUNG UPSTANDING
PROFESSIONALS,

04:28.730 --> 04:30.664
ALL OF WHOM THE PUBLIC
CAN EMOTIONALLY INVEST IN.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.531
THE CRIME ITSELF
IS CONTAINED,

04:32.570 --> 04:34.629
AND THE MOTIVE APPEARS
TO BE DETERMINED.

04:34.670 --> 04:37.059
JJ: THE M.O. IS PRETI'Y
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.772
THEIR HANDS AND MOUTHS
WERE DUCT -TAPED

04:39.810 --> 04:41.004
AND THEY WERE
STABBED REPEATEDLY.

04:42.810 --> 04:43.970
I SEE THE UNSUB
LEFI' A KNIFE.

04:44.010 --> 04:45.546
WERE THERE ANY PRINTS?

04:45.580 --> 04:46.717
NEGATIVE.

04:46.750 --> 04:48.672
WITH THIS MANY VICTIMS,
IT COULD BE A TEAM.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.688
RIGHT. SHOULDN'T
RULE IT OUT.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.848
JJ: YOU'RE RIGHT. OK.
WHEELS UP IN 20.

04:53.890 --> 04:55.949
BARNES: MEET YOU
ON THE TARMAC.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.596
YOU'RE GOING INTO
THE FIELD WITH US?

05:00.630 --> 05:01.858
YES.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.925
NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU'RE
NOT A PROFILER.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.699
TRUE, BUT I HAVE
WORKED IN THE FIELD,

05:05.730 --> 05:08.938
AND A FRESH SET OF EYES
MIGHT BE USEFUL.

05:08.970 --> 05:11.837
I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M THE ENEMY, BUT I'M NOT.

05:11.870 --> 05:13.872
I CAN BE YOUR GREATEST
ADVOCATE IF YOU'D LET ME.

05:13.910 --> 05:15.775
NOW, YOU'VE HAD SOME POOR
LEADERSHIP IN THE PAST,

05:15.810 --> 05:17.971
BUT I KNOW I CAN HELP
RIGHT THE SHIP.

05:18.010 --> 05:20.843
NO. YOU'RE WRONG.
EMILY PRENTISS
IS NOT A POOR LEADER.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.848
SHE DEFINED WHAT
A UNIT CHIEF SHOULD BE.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.414
I'M NOT GOING
TO STAND HERE

05:24.450 --> 05:25.883
AND LET YOU DESTROY
HER CAREER LIKE THIS.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.354
IF YOU'RE GOING,
I'M NOT.

05:31.430 --> 05:33.853
ROSSI: YOU KNOW, THE KID
LOOKS A LITTLE FLUSH.

05:33.900 --> 05:38.564
NEEDS A SICK DAY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

05:38.600 --> 05:41.637
ANYBODY ELSE
NEED A SICK DAY?

05:42.870 --> 05:47.978
GOOD. THEN AS AGENT JAREAU
SAID, WHEELS UP IN 20.

05:49.980 --> 05:52.869
OK.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.139
COME ON, GUYS, WE STILL
HAVE A JOB TO DO.

05:56.180 --> 05:58.717
TH ESE PEOPLE
DESERVE JUSTICE.

06:24.780 --> 06:27.874
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

06:36.890 --> 06:38.619
PRENTISS: "FAMILY QUARRELS
ARE BITI'ER THINGS.

06:38.660 --> 06:39.729
"THEY'RE NOT LIKE
ACHES OR WOUNDS,

06:39.760 --> 06:42.729
"THEY'RE MORE LIKE SPLITS
IN THE SKIN THAT WON'T HEAL

06:42.770 --> 06:44.897
BECAUSE THERE'S
NOT ENOUGH MATERIAL."

06:44.930 --> 06:46.591
F. SCO'I'I' FITZGERALD.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.165
SO EACH OF THE 4 VICTIMS
WERE IN THEIR EARLY 20$

06:49.200 --> 06:50.633
AND RENTED A ROOM
FROM A HOUSE

06:50.670 --> 06:52.160
OWNED BY AN AGM PROPERTIES.

06:52.210 --> 06:54.576
LOOKS LIKE THEY
WERE A NAMELESS,
FACELESS LANDLORD.

06:54.610 --> 06:56.032
BUT THE VICTIMS WEREN'T.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.707
CHARLES COOK
TAUGHT HIGH SCHOOL MATH.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.615
VICKY WILSON WORKED
AT A NONPROFIT.

06:59.650 --> 07:01.709
ALVEZ: JENNY KYLE
WAS IN MEDICAL SCHOOL

07:01.750 --> 07:03.980
WHILE RAY MURPHY WAS
FINISHING UP LAW SCHOOL.

07:04.020 --> 07:05.988
I DON'T SEE ANY RED FLAGS
IN THEIR PASTS.

07:06.020 --> 07:08.488
NO CRIMINAL HISTORIES,
NO INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.418
NOT EVEN A SPEEDING TICKET.

07:09.460 --> 07:11.985
THEY WERE JUST LIVING
NORMAL, REGULAR LIVES.

07:12.030 --> 07:13.895
SIMMONS: AND SURPRISINGLY,
NONE OF THEM APPEARED
TO BE HOOKING UP.

07:13.930 --> 07:16.592
YOU'D THINK IN THOSE CLOSE
QUARTERS, THAT AGE GROUP,

07:16.630 --> 07:18.029
THEY'D BE BOUND TO PAIR OFF.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.765
LOOKING AT
THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA,

07:19.800 --> 07:21.859
IT SEEMS THEIR HOUSE
WAS THE PLACE TO BE.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.060
THEY HELD
DINNER PARTIES,

07:23.110 --> 07:24.236
THEY HOSTED GAME NIGHT,

07:24.270 --> 07:26.204
THEY HAD PEOPLE OVER
TO WATCH SPORTS.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.605
THAT MUCH
FOOT TRAFFIC

07:27.640 --> 07:29.608
WIDENS OUR INITIAL
SUSPECT POOL.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.709
GOOD DAY. IT LOOKS
LIKE THE HOUSE

07:31.750 --> 07:33.172
WAS A LOT MORE CROWDED
THAN WE THOUGHT.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.949
THREE OTHER PEOPLE
LIVED THERE, TOO.

07:34.980 --> 07:36.811
I'M SENDING YOU
THEIR INFORMATION NOW.

07:38.650 --> 07:40.709
JJ: SO CORRINE JORDAN'S
A FLIGHT A'I'I'ENDANT.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.625
SHE WAS IN ZURICH DURING
THE TIME OF THE MURDERS.

07:42.660 --> 07:45.220
LEWIS: AND RACHEL WILLOW
IS AN ACCOUNTANT.

07:45.260 --> 07:47.023
SHE SPENT THE NIGHT
AT HER SISTER'S

07:47.060 --> 07:49.665
AND THEN HEADED STRAIGHT
TO THE PD AFI'ER
THEY NOTIFIED HER.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.190
SHE'S WAITING FOR US
THERE NOW.

07:51.230 --> 07:52.788
THAT LEAVES LARRY SCANLON,
A PSYCHOLOGIST

07:52.840 --> 07:54.239
AT A MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC.

07:54.270 --> 07:55.931
HE'S STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR.

07:55.970 --> 07:57.232
BARNES:
WHICH MAKES LARRY
OUR PRIMARY SUSPECT.

07:57.270 --> 07:59.067
HE NEEDS TO BE
LOCATED ASAP.

07:59.110 --> 08:01.578
GARCIA, CHECK ALL OF HIS
RECENT ONLINE ACTIVITY.

08:01.610 --> 08:02.702
GARCIA: OK.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.809
BARNES: ALVEZ,
WORK WITH THE LOCALS
TO SEARCH FOR LARRY.

08:04.850 --> 08:08.570
MA'IT, HEAD TO THE M.E. WHILE
AGENTS JAREAU AND LEWIS
SET UP AT THE PD.

08:08.620 --> 08:11.885
AGENT ROSSI, YOU AND I WILL
HEAD TO THE CRIME SCENE.

08:23.830 --> 08:25.263
YOUR DAUGHTER'S IN
THE BAY AREA, HUH?

08:25.300 --> 08:26.631
IT'S BEAUTIFUL UP THERE.

08:26.670 --> 08:27.989
YEAH.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.759
I HEAR YOU HAVE
A GRANDSON WHO'S 5?

08:30.810 --> 08:32.869
MY SON JUST TURNED 6.

08:32.910 --> 08:34.002
IT SEEMS LIKE JUST YESTERDAY

08:34.040 --> 08:35.200
HE WAS IN MY ARMS
AT THE HOSPITAL,

08:35.240 --> 08:36.639
AND NOW KENNY DOESN'T
WANT A HUG

08:36.680 --> 08:37.704
WHEN I DROP HIM OFF
AT SCHOOL.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.001
HMM.

08:39.050 --> 08:39.869
I LOOK FORWARD
TO THE DAY THAT

08:39.920 --> 08:41.649
I CAN SIT ON MY PORCH,
ENJOY THE SUNSET,

08:41.680 --> 08:42.840
GLASS OF RED IN MY HAND,

08:42.890 --> 08:44.881
WITH NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.785
OK. STOP.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.583
STOP WHAT?

08:48.620 --> 08:49.848
YOU'RE SNIFFING AROUND

08:49.890 --> 08:51.755
TO SEE IF I'M
UP FOR RETIREMENT.

08:51.790 --> 08:54.293
DON'T BE SO PARANOID,
AGENT ROSSI.

08:54.330 --> 08:57.026
I'M JUST MAKING
CONVERSATION.

08:57.070 --> 09:00.562
BESIDES, I'M IN NO
POSITION TO DO THAT.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.728
THAT'S RIGHT. BECAUSE WHEN
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO RETIRE,

09:03.770 --> 09:06.568
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

09:20.090 --> 09:22.820
OUR UNSUB CORRALLED
ALL 4 VICTIMS

09:22.860 --> 09:24.282
AND KILLED THEM
HERE IN THE LIVING ROOM.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.059
4 PEOPLE IS A LOT
TO CONTROL.

09:26.090 --> 09:27.694
HE MUST HAVE USED
A GUN.

09:27.730 --> 09:29.197
YEAH. THAT
AND THE DUCT TAPE.

09:29.230 --> 09:33.166
BUT WHY BRING A KNIFE
TO A GUNFIGHT?

09:33.200 --> 09:35.065
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
TO CONTROL THE NOISE.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.967
OR THERE'S SOMETHING
SPECIAL ABOUT THAT KNIFE.

09:41.940 --> 09:45.205
AND THIS WINDOW WAS
BUSTED OUT FROM THE INSIDE.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.774
BARNES:
SO THE BREAK-IN WAS STAGED.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.708
LOOKS LIKE IT.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.082
AGENTS, I THINK
YOU SHOULD SEE THIS.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.883
HE GRABBED THE MURDER
WEAPON FROM THERE.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.080
WHERE DID YOU
FIND THAT?

09:56.120 --> 09:58.657
UNDER ONE OF
THE VICTIMS' BED--RAY MURPHY.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.290
BARNES: SO IT WASN'T JUST
LEFI' OUT IN THE OPEN.

10:02.330 --> 10:04.059
YOU'D HAVE TO KNOW
WHERE TO LOOK TO FIND IT.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.989
GET THAT INTO EVIDENCE
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.258
SO, THE UNSUB'S
AN INSIDER

10:09.300 --> 10:11.302
WHO WANTED US TO THINK
HE'S AN OUTSIDER

10:11.340 --> 10:13.205
AND HE HAS AN AX
TO GRIND WITH THEM.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.037
IT'S LOOKING MORE AND MORE
LIKE LARRY DID IT.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.105
I THINK FINDING HIM
SHOULD BE OUR MAIN FOCUS.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.176
I'M GOING TO CALL GARCIA
AND SEE IF SHE'S MADE
ANY PROGRESS.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.383
SEE HOW EFFICIENTLY THINGS
WORK WITHOUT AGENT PRENTISS?

10:30.190 --> 10:32.283
SPENCER, OH, MY GOD.
WHAT DID YOU DO?

10:32.330 --> 10:33.297
I HAD TO.

10:33.330 --> 10:34.922
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.097
LIFE'S TOO SHORT FOR
PEOPLE LIKE LINDA BARNES.

10:36.130 --> 10:37.427
SPENCE--

10:37.470 --> 10:38.664
I WASN'T GONNA, YOU KNOW,
GO WITH HER

10:38.700 --> 10:40.759
AND HELP HER
DISMANTLE THE TEAM.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.109
THANK YOU FOR
STANDING UP FOR ME.

10:43.140 --> 10:46.109
I APPRECIATE YOU
COMING TO THE HOUSE
FOR SUPPORT,

10:46.140 --> 10:48.404
BUT WHAT YOU DID
WAS RECKLESS.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.000
THE BAU IS UNDER THE
MICROSCOPE RIGHT NOW,

10:51.050 --> 10:52.779
AND THE LAST THING
YOU SHOULD BE DOING

10:52.820 --> 10:55.812
IS GIVING BARNES
MORE AMMUNITION.

10:55.850 --> 10:58.216
YOU'RE MAKING
HER JOB EASIER.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.411
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET RID OF ME?

11:00.460 --> 11:02.382
WHAT?

11:02.420 --> 11:05.321
EVER SINCE I GOT HERE,
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
TO KEEP ME OUT OF--

11:05.360 --> 11:08.124
NO, I JUST, UH--
NO, I WASN'T
EXPECTING ANYONE

11:08.160 --> 11:09.696
AND THE PLACE--

11:09.730 --> 11:11.095
SPENCE, STOP!

11:11.130 --> 11:13.166
IT'S BEEN LESS THAN TWO DAYS
AND YOU'RE ALREADY LEAVING.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.236
I'M--I--

11:17.840 --> 11:19.979
OK, LOOK.

11:20.010 --> 11:22.274
BARNES WANTS SOMEBODY
TO TAKE THE FALL

11:22.310 --> 11:23.743
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
IN ROSWELL.

11:23.780 --> 11:25.145
I'M WILLING TO BE
THAT SOMEBODY

11:25.180 --> 11:27.011
IF IT WILL HELP
STABILIZE THE BAU.

11:27.050 --> 11:28.312
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS
WITH JJ.

11:28.350 --> 11:30.215
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
THAT SHE WON'T REPLACE HER

11:30.250 --> 11:31.740
THE MINUTE YOU'RE GONE.

11:31.790 --> 11:33.280
I THINK THAT
IF I GO AWAY FOR GOOD,

11:33.320 --> 11:34.309
SHE'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

11:34.360 --> 11:38.080
YOU CAN STILL FIGHT THIS.
WE CAN STILL FIGHT THIS.

11:41.860 --> 11:43.760
AH...

11:45.170 --> 11:48.139
MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO.

11:48.170 --> 11:51.298
WELL, NOW WHO'S MAKING
IT EASY FOR BARNES?

11:56.180 --> 11:57.841
BARNES: DETECTIVE MORRIS...

11:57.880 --> 11:58.904
I'M ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
LINDA BARNES.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.076
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.246
THANKS FOR GETTING
HERE SO QUICKLY.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.884
WE'RE EXCITED
TO HAVE YOUR HELP.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.239
I'M SSA JENNIFER JAREAU.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.144
NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.280
IS THERE A QUIET PLACE
WE CAN SET UP?

12:09.320 --> 12:10.981
THE CONFERENCE ROOM'S
ALL YOURS.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.895
I'LL JOIN YOU IN A MINUTE
TO GET YOU UP TO SPEED.

12:12.930 --> 12:16.354
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
WE'VE ALREADY
HIT THE GROUND RUNNING.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.322
CAN ONE OF YOUR PEOPLE
BRING ME A COFFEE?

12:20.070 --> 12:22.038
OK. NO PROBLEM.

12:22.070 --> 12:23.332
THAN KS.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.872
I'M SORRY.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.217
FOR WHAT?

12:34.250 --> 12:36.309
I DIDN'T ASK
IF YOU WANTED COFFEE.

12:36.350 --> 12:38.045
LEWIS: GARCIA'S GOT
SOME NEW INFORMATION

12:38.090 --> 12:39.955
ON THAT MISSING
ROOMMATE, LARRY SCANLON.

12:39.990 --> 12:42.515
HEY, PENELOPE, ON SPEAKER.
I GOT JJ AND BARNES WITH ME.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.084
GARCIA: COPY THAT.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.483
UH, HERE WE GO.

12:45.530 --> 12:47.828
LARRY SCANLON
HAS A LONG HISTORY

12:47.860 --> 12:49.452
OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE

12:49.500 --> 12:51.968
AND ALSO ONE OF
INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.230
TWO DUIs COST HIM
HIS LICENSE,

12:54.270 --> 12:56.238
AND THEN HE WAS PICKED UP

12:56.270 --> 12:57.862
FOR POSSESSION
OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.207
HOW DOES HE
STILL HAVE A JOB?

12:59.240 --> 13:02.073
ACCORDING TO WORK REVIEWS,
HE IS AN IDEAL EMPLOYEE,

13:02.110 --> 13:04.374
AND HE WILL DO ANYTHING
TO HELP HIS CLIENTS.

13:04.410 --> 13:06.071
AND THE VIOLENCE?

13:06.110 --> 13:07.213
UH, HE WAS IN TWO
BAR FIGHTS.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.138
ONE HE STARTED,
THE OTHER HE FINISHED.

13:09.180 --> 13:11.410
BOTH TIMES CHARGES
WERE FILED BUT THEN DROPPED.

13:11.450 --> 13:13.589
OK, HOW DOES HE FIT IN
WITH THE HOUSE?

13:13.620 --> 13:15.315
GOOD. OR AT LEAST
GOOD ENOUGH.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.157
UH, UP UNTIL TWO DAYS AGO.

13:17.190 --> 13:18.327
NOW, I'M COBBLING THIS
TOGETHER

13:18.360 --> 13:19.998
FROM MESSAGES
ON THE VICTIMS' PHONES,

13:20.030 --> 13:22.191
BUT IT APPEARS THAT
LARRY AND RAY

13:22.230 --> 13:24.289
GOT INTO A SCREAMING
AND SHOVING MATCH.

13:24.330 --> 13:26.969
UH, THEN EVERYONE
IN THE HOUSEHOLD

13:27.000 --> 13:29.195
UNANIMOUSLY VOTED
TO HAVE HIM THROWN OUT.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.401
THEN WHEN LARRY TRIED
TO CONTACT THEM LATER,

13:31.440 --> 13:33.328
NOBODY RESPONDED.
IT'S LIKE THEY DISOWNED HIM.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.099
THAT COULD BE HIS MOTIVE.
ANY LUCK TRACKING HIM DOWN?

13:36.140 --> 13:37.971
GARCIA: NO. I'VE LOOKED
INTO HIS FAMILY.
I'VE GOT NOTHING THERE.

13:38.010 --> 13:39.500
LARRY'S TRAIL WENT
REAL DARK REAL FAST.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.415
MOVE ON TO OTHER FRIENDS
AND CO-WORKERS.

13:41.450 --> 13:42.849
HE COULD BE COUCH SURFING.

13:42.890 --> 13:45.040
NICE WORK, GARCIA.
ALL OF THIS HELPS.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.580
OH, THANK YOU, MA'AM.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.850
RACHEL'S STILL WAITING
TO BE INTERVIEWED.

13:48.890 --> 13:50.357
SHE COULD KNOW
WHERE THIS GUY'S GONE.

13:50.390 --> 13:52.950
I'LL WALK WITH YOU.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.228
THANK YOU.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.897
WE NEED A STATEMENT
FROM RACHEL THAT SAYS

13:59.940 --> 14:02.238
WITHOUT A DOUBT SHE BELIEVES
LARRY KILLED THEIR FRIENDS.

14:02.270 --> 14:04.238
IT'LL BOLSTER THE EVIDENCE
WE ALREADY HAD AGAINST HIM.

14:04.270 --> 14:05.965
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
SHE'LL SAY THAT.

14:06.010 --> 14:08.274
HE IS OUR BEST AND ONLY
SUSPECT FOR A REASON.

14:08.310 --> 14:09.504
THE PIECES ADD UP.

14:09.540 --> 14:12.270
LOOK, WE DON'T PUT WORDS
IN PEOPLE'S MOUTHS.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.039
THAT'S NOT
HOW OUR INTERVIEWS WORK.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.968
I'LL BE IN THERE
WITH YOU FOR SUPPORT.

14:16.020 --> 14:19.183
I WON'T SAY A WORD
UNLESS YOU NEED HELP,
I PROMISE.

14:22.490 --> 14:26.324
RACHEL: I SHOULD BE DEAD.
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE,

14:26.360 --> 14:31.889
BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE
I WENT OVER TO MY SISTER'S.

14:31.930 --> 14:35.229
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST TALK TO CORRINE.

14:35.270 --> 14:36.669
WE WILL.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.305
BUT SHE'S ON
A FLIGHT BACK.

14:39.340 --> 14:43.299
AND, HONESTLY, I THINK
YOU'RE THE BEST PERSON

14:43.350 --> 14:45.102
TO HELP US FIND LARRY.

14:47.050 --> 14:49.518
I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.049
I THINK YOU DO.

14:57.360 --> 15:01.091
YOU MIGHT EVEN BE SCARED
THAT HE'D COME AFTER YOU

15:01.130 --> 15:03.325
IF YOU TOLD US.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.268
WE KNOW LARRY HAS
A VIOLENT STREAK.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.404
THE BAR FIGHTS
WEREN'T HIS FAULT.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.203
NOT ONLY THE BAR FIGHTS.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.504
HE'S BEEN STRESSED
AT WORK.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.179
AND AFTER HIS MOM DIED,
HE WENT OVER THE EDGE,

15:18.210 --> 15:21.213
BUT NOW LARRY'S BEEN
GETTING HELP.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.115
WE KNOW LARRY WAS KICKED
OUT OF THE HOUSE

15:23.150 --> 15:25.038
TWO NIGHTS
BEFORE THE MURDERS.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.217
NO, THAT WAS
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.353
I TOLD RAY TO GO
AND SMOOTH IT OUT.

15:29.390 --> 15:31.449
THAT WAY HE COULD
MOVE BACK IN.

15:31.490 --> 15:35.096
YOU KEEP DEFENDING
LARRY.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.559
YOU TWO WERE DATING?

15:44.470 --> 15:48.531
DATING IN THE HOUSE
IS AGAINST THE RULES,

15:48.580 --> 15:52.368
SO WE HAD TO KEEP IT
A SECRET.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.283
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
HE KILLED THEM.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.285
WHERE IS HE, RACHEL?

16:03.530 --> 16:06.419
HE'S STAYING
WITH A CO-WORKER.

16:06.460 --> 16:09.054
HIS APARTMENT IS
ON PINE AND OKETO.

16:20.410 --> 16:23.402
NO! NO! NO!

16:36.420 --> 16:38.126
BARNES: LARRY SCANLON
DIED OF A DRUG OVERDOSE.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.627
WE WON'T KNOW FOR
SURE UNTIL WE GET
BACK HIS TOX SCREEN.

16:39.660 --> 16:41.355
DETECTIVE, WHO FOUND HIM?

16:41.400 --> 16:42.549
A WOMAN WALKING BY.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.589
SHE CALLED IT IN
IMMEDIATELY.

16:43.630 --> 16:46.497
THIS SUICIDE NOTE WAS TAPED
TO THE STEERING WHEEL.

16:49.140 --> 16:51.438
HE CONFESSED
TO ALL 4 MURDERS.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.574
THIS GUY'S NEVER HAD
ANY SUICIDAL TENDENCIES.

16:53.610 --> 16:55.578
BARNES: HE MUST HAVE FELT US
CLOSING IN AND PANICKED.

16:55.610 --> 16:57.544
HERE'S THE PRELIM
TOX SCREEN.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.172
OH. THANKS.

17:01.250 --> 17:04.708
THERE WERE NO DRUGS
FOUND IN HIS SYSTEM.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.082
THAT'S POOR PLANNING
ON THE PART OF THE UNSUB.

17:07.120 --> 17:09.452
HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

17:09.490 --> 17:11.481
LET'S GET A HANDWRITING
ANALYSIS DONE ON THAT NOTE.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.157
THIS WAS STAGED, THEN.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.553
YEAH, IT LOOKS
THAT WAY.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.727
THE ANALYSIS
WILL HELP CONFIRM,

17:16.760 --> 17:20.161
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
LARRY WAS SET UP.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.339
AND IT WASN'T BY
ONE OF HIS HOUSEMATES.

17:22.370 --> 17:24.133
OK, BUT THEN BY WHO?

17:24.170 --> 17:26.138
LEWIS: SOMEONE WHO STILL
KNEW THEM ALL PRETTY WELL.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.104
PRENTISS: THIS IS
THE RIGHT DECISION FOR ME.

17:28.140 --> 17:29.437
I NEED YOU TO SUPPORT THAT.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.573
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?
I MEAN, WHERE
ARE YOU GONNA GO?

17:31.610 --> 17:34.408
WHEN I LEI-T INTERPOL,
THEY SAID THE DOOR

17:34.450 --> 17:36.270
WAS ALWAYS OPEN TO RETURN.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.187
I LIKE LONDON. SO...

17:39.220 --> 17:40.619
WELL, IF YOU REALLY WANT
ME TO SUPPORT YOU,

17:40.660 --> 17:42.287
JUST ANSWER ME
THIS ONE QUESTION.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.548
WHY IS IT NOT OK

17:43.590 --> 17:45.285
FOR ME TO WALK
OUT ON THE TEAM

17:45.330 --> 17:46.581
BUT IT IS
FOR YOU?

17:46.630 --> 17:49.098
BECAUSE YOU AND I
ARE DIFFERENT.

17:49.130 --> 17:50.461
WE'RE NOT. AND IF THE
SITUATION WAS REVERSED,

17:50.500 --> 17:52.525
YOU WOULDN'T GIVE UP ON
ME. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:52.570 --> 17:54.094
I HAPPEN TO KNOW
THAT FOR A FACT

17:54.140 --> 17:55.562
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.794
WHEN I WAS IN PRISON,

17:56.840 --> 17:59.604
YOU DID EVERYTHING
IN YOUR POWER
TO GET ME OUT.

18:01.810 --> 18:03.277
WHAT?

18:04.850 --> 18:08.172
YEAH. I DID DO EVERYTHING.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.108
I NEEDED TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU WERE INNOCENT

18:10.150 --> 18:11.640
OF KILLING NADIE RAMOS.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.578
I WAS INNOCENT.

18:13.620 --> 18:15.156
THAT WASN'T OBVIOUS
AT FIRST.

18:15.190 --> 18:16.714
LIKE WHEN WE TALKED
IN THAT MEXICAN JAIL.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.125
DO YOU REMEMBER?

18:19.590 --> 18:23.265
NO. I KNOW I WAS DRUGGED
AND EVERYTHING WAS FUZZY.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.666
I MADE A DEAL
WITH THE LOCAL COP.

18:25.700 --> 18:28.533
I TOLD HIM I NEEDED
TO GO AT IT ALONE.

18:28.570 --> 18:32.165
I PROMISED I'D GIVE HIM
THE RECORDING.

18:32.210 --> 18:36.670
I WAS TRYING TO FIND
ANY EVIDENCE
THAT YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

18:36.710 --> 18:39.406
BUT WHAT YOU TOLD ME
WAS THAT YOU REMEMBERED

18:39.450 --> 18:41.771
HOLDING THE MURDER WEAPON.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.483
I DID?

18:46.520 --> 18:48.158
REID: THERE'S A KNIFE.

18:48.190 --> 18:50.329
THERE'S A KNIFE AND
THERE'S A LOT OF BLOOD.

18:50.360 --> 18:51.679
PRENTISS:
WHO HAS THE KNIFE?

18:51.730 --> 18:54.494
THE MORE YOU TALKED,
THE MORE YOU
INCRIMINATED YOURSELF.

18:54.530 --> 18:56.327
NO.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.499
I LOOKED THROUGH
ALL THE CASE FILES

18:58.530 --> 19:00.191
AFTER I WAS EXONERATED.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.332
THERE WASN'T
A SINGLE RECORD OF--

19:05.410 --> 19:06.729
YOU DELETED IT.

19:08.910 --> 19:11.447
I DID.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.711
I CROSSED A LINE
I SWORE I NEVER WOULD.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.945
BARNES CALLED ME OUT ON IT.

19:16.980 --> 19:19.517
AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED
SHE WAS RIGHT.

19:19.550 --> 19:22.519
I DO HOLD THIS TEAM
ABOVE THE VERY LAWS

19:22.560 --> 19:25.256
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO UPHOLD.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.450
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE INNOCENT,

19:26.490 --> 19:29.425
AND YOU DESERVED TO BE
REINSTATED AS AN SSA.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.190
THAT'S WHY IT'S WRONG
FOR YOU TO QUIT.

19:32.230 --> 19:34.391
BUT ME, I'VE LOST
THE PRIVILEGE

19:34.440 --> 19:36.897
TO RUN THIS TEAM.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.785
SIMMONS: READY TO DIG INTO
THE VICTIMS' LIVES?

19:52.820 --> 19:56.381
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO READY.

19:56.420 --> 19:58.684
THERE'S GOTTA BE A CLUE
IN THEIR STUFF.

20:11.570 --> 20:14.334
SIMMONS: "CONGRATS
ON THE PROMOTION. RAY."

20:26.720 --> 20:30.554
"LARRY, YOU'RE NOT
ALONE. RAY."

20:32.490 --> 20:35.721
ROSSI: "THINK YOU'LL
LOVE THIS. RAY."

20:41.800 --> 20:43.301
ROSSI: YOU SEE THIS?

20:43.340 --> 20:44.807
YEAH.

20:44.840 --> 20:47.377
THEY'RE ROOMMATES, BUT
THEY'RE EXTREMELY CLOSE,

20:47.410 --> 20:50.345
AND RAY IS CLEARLY
THE LEADER.

20:52.410 --> 20:53.718
HEY.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.479
THOUGHT YOU COULD USE ONE.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.283
THAN KS.

20:57.320 --> 21:00.483
I READ YOUR REPORT ON
THE DEATH OF MR. SCRATCH.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.626
CHOOSING TO LET HIM FALL
WAS THE BEST THING
YOU COULD HAVE DONE.

21:03.660 --> 21:04.786
THE WORLD'S
A BETTER PLACE FOR IT.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.526
YOU DON'T THINK
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
BROUGHT TO JUSTICE?

21:07.560 --> 21:09.528
IN MY BOOK,
THAT WAS JUSTICE.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.323
THAT KIND OF
SPLIT-SECOND CALL,

21:11.370 --> 21:13.463
THAT'S YOUR FUGITIVE
TASKFORCE TRAINING.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.797
THAT'S YOUR STRENGTH.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.434
ONE OF THEM, YEAH.

21:17.470 --> 21:20.337
THE PAST COUPLE OF
YEARS HAVE CHANGED ME,

21:20.380 --> 21:24.009
PUSHED ME TO EXPAND
MY THINKING.

21:24.050 --> 21:27.417
YEAH. BUT...

21:27.450 --> 21:31.716
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE
LET OFF YOUR LEASH AGAIN?

21:31.750 --> 21:34.014
I BELONG HERE.

21:38.990 --> 21:41.697
ROSSI: THESE SEVEN HAVE
KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS,

21:41.730 --> 21:43.561
AND THEY'RE AS CLOSE
AS ANY FAMILY.

21:43.600 --> 21:44.897
SIMMONS: YEAH, THEY EACH
FILL A CERTAIN ROLE.

21:44.930 --> 21:47.637
RAY'S THE DAD,
AND IT GOES FROM THERE.

21:47.670 --> 21:51.003
WE NEED TO START
SEEING THIS GUY
AS A FAMILY ANNIHILATOR.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.838
WELL, MAYBE THEIR REJECT ION
OF THE UNSUB IS WHAT
LED TO THE ATTACK.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.370
BINGO.

21:55.410 --> 21:57.344
SIMMONS: I'LL FIND LEWIS,
AND WE'LL ASK RACHEL

21:57.380 --> 21:59.678
IF ANYBODY MATCHES
THE PROFILE.

21:59.710 --> 22:01.712
PERFECT. LET'S GO.

22:12.060 --> 22:14.927
DO NOT TELL RACHEL
THAT LARRY DIED.

22:14.960 --> 22:18.020
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO INFORM A PERSON

22:18.070 --> 22:20.459
WHEN SOMETHING'S HAPPENED
TO THEIR LOVED ONE.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.058
I HAVE THE FEELING
IF YOU TELL HER HERE,
SHE'LL FALL APART

22:22.100 --> 22:24.807
AND SHE WON'T BE ABLE
TO HELP US.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.705
IS THAT A DIRECT ORDER?

22:26.740 --> 22:28.731
YES.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.747
YOU TALKED TO LARRY?

22:38.790 --> 22:40.678
HE'S IN NOCENT, RIGHT?

22:40.720 --> 22:42.051
WE DID FIND HIM,

22:42.090 --> 22:44.479
AND HE IS INNOCENT.

22:46.030 --> 22:48.055
WHERE IS HE?

22:48.100 --> 22:51.524
IS HE HERE?
CAN I SEE HIM?

22:53.170 --> 22:55.889
RACHEL, IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S BEEN A BREAK
IN THE CASE,

22:55.940 --> 22:59.637
AND WE THINK YOU CAN
HELP US AGAIN.

22:59.670 --> 23:04.403
WE BELIEVE WHOEVER DID THIS
IS SOMEONE YOU ALL KNOW.

23:04.450 --> 23:05.701
SIMMONS:
THIS GUY'S A NARCISSIST.

23:05.750 --> 23:08.514
HE THINKS HE SHOULD BE
IN CHARGE, BUT HE ISN'T,

23:08.550 --> 23:10.541
AND THAT TICKS HIM OFF.

23:10.590 --> 23:13.582
HE'S ALSO WHAT WE CALL
AN INJUSTICE COLLECTOR,

23:13.620 --> 23:15.679
WHICH MEANS HE HOLDS ON
TO ANY SLIGHT,

23:15.720 --> 23:18.086
BIG OR SMALL,
REAL OR PERCEIVED.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.428
BARNES:
HE SAW YOU 7 AS A FAMILY.

23:20.460 --> 23:22.758
HE WAS DESPERATE TO JOIN
BUT HE WAS NEVER ALLOWED.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.722
DOES THIS SOUND LIKE
ANYBODY YOU KNOW?

23:24.770 --> 23:26.761
SORRY. NO.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.689
RAY WOULD NEVER LET
A WEIRDO LIKE THAT
HANG AROUND.

23:29.740 --> 23:33.506
SO, WHAT IF THE UNSUB
PLAYED IT THE OPPOSITE WAY?

23:33.540 --> 23:35.929
HE WOULD COME ACROSS
AS HARMLESS.

23:35.980 --> 23:38.073
UM, ALWAYS OFFER
A HELPING HAND.

23:38.110 --> 23:40.044
HE'D EVEN DO A CHORE OR
TWO WITHOUT BEING ASKED.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.968
HE'D FEEL COMFORTABLE
AROUND THE HOUSE

23:42.020 --> 23:44.784
BUT NEVER OPENLY ASK
TO MOVE IN.

23:44.820 --> 23:46.549
THAT SOUNDS LIKE JUSTIN.

23:47.990 --> 23:49.719
WHO'S HE?

23:49.760 --> 23:51.785
JUSTIN FRANCO.

23:51.830 --> 23:53.491
BUT HE'S HARMLESS.

23:53.530 --> 23:55.953
KIND OF ANNOYING
BUT A REALLY NICE GUY.

23:57.830 --> 23:59.024
THANKS, RACHEL.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.530
CAN I SEE LARRY NOW?

24:08.710 --> 24:11.873
NOT YET. I'M SORRY.

24:15.180 --> 24:16.875
HEY!

24:18.090 --> 24:19.978
DON'T YOU EVER ORDER ME

24:20.020 --> 24:21.749
TO DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.895
I LOVE YOU EACH SO MUCH,
I WANT TO LICK YOUR FACES.

24:36.940 --> 24:38.601
OH, LISTEN TO ME
SAYING MY THINGS.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.029
ISN'T THE WORLD A BRIGHTER
PLACE WITH MORE AIR

24:41.080 --> 24:43.173
WHEN LINDA BARNES ISN'T AROUND
BEING LINDA BARNES?

24:43.210 --> 24:45.201
NO COMMENT.
NEXT QUESTION.

24:45.250 --> 24:46.842
IT'S NOT A QUESTION, PER SE,

24:46.880 --> 24:49.019
AS MUCH A CONFIRMATION
OF A FACT.

24:49.050 --> 24:51.610
JUSTIN FRANCO IS EXACTLY
WHAT RACHEL SAYS HE IS.

24:51.650 --> 24:53.140
HE'S ALL SUNSHINE
AND RAINBOWS AND UNICORNS,

24:53.190 --> 24:56.159
BUT, AND IT'S A BIG "BUT,"
HE'S ONLY THAT ON THE SURFACE.

24:56.190 --> 24:57.828
MY DEEP DIVE INTO
HIS WEB LIFE,

24:57.860 --> 24:59.657
WHICH ACTUALLY
IS PRETTY SHALLOW

24:59.690 --> 25:01.555
'CAUSE HE DID NOT
DO A GOOD JOB
HIDING HIS IP ADDRESS,

25:01.600 --> 25:04.990
SHOWS THAT HE SAYS A LOT
OF INFLAMMATORY COMMENTS

25:05.030 --> 25:08.693
ON VARIOUS SITES,
MESSAGE BOARDS,
ET CETERA, ET CETERA.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.162
ANY TOPIC IN PARTICULAR?

25:10.200 --> 25:11.804
OH, NO.
IT'S A SCATTERSHOT.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.308
HE'S AN "ANY PORT
IN THE STORM" KIND OF TROLL.

25:14.340 --> 25:15.705
HOW CHARMING.

25:15.740 --> 25:17.742
THE ANONYMOUS POSTINGS,
THE MASKED BEHAVIOR.

25:17.780 --> 25:20.749
HE DOESN'T WANT THE
WORLD TO SEE HIS RAGE.

25:20.780 --> 25:21.974
WORK AND HOME ADDRESSES?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.885
GARCIA: WORK IS EASY.
HE'S A MARKETING
COORDINATOR DOWNTOWN.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.114
THERE THAT IS.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.811
HOME IS TRICKY.
I GOT A P.O. BOX.

25:26.850 --> 25:28.750
I'LL HIT YOU BACK
AS SOON AS I KNOW
WHERE HE'S STAYING.

25:28.790 --> 25:30.257
IF JUSTIN'S GOING AI-TER
EACH OF THESE ROOMMATES,

25:30.290 --> 25:32.019
WE NEED TO KEEP RACHEL HERE
UNTIL THIS IS OVER.

25:32.060 --> 25:33.698
LET'S GET A MESSAGE
TO CORRINE ON THE PLANE.

25:33.730 --> 25:34.754
THEY CAN DEBOARD
ON THE TARMAC

25:34.800 --> 25:35.994
AND WE CAN ESCORT
HER FROM THERE.

25:36.030 --> 25:37.190
YEAH. THAN KS, GARCIA.

25:37.230 --> 25:38.595
I'M GOING TO RELISH
THIS TIME

25:38.630 --> 25:40.791
WE'VE HAD ALONE
TOGETHER FOREVER.

25:50.910 --> 25:52.775
THANK YOU.

25:52.810 --> 25:54.243
WHAT?

25:54.280 --> 25:55.872
THANK YOU
FOR COVERING FOR ME.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.684
I MIGHT STILL BE IN
JAIL IF YOU HADN'T.

25:58.720 --> 25:59.948
YOU'RE WELCOME.

25:59.990 --> 26:02.584
I'M NOT DONE.

26:02.620 --> 26:05.987
THANK YOU,
BUT I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO.

26:06.030 --> 26:09.329
WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE
BEATEN THE CHARGE.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.261
MAYBE. NOW WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

26:12.300 --> 26:13.938
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
MY POINT.

26:13.970 --> 26:15.790
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
IT'S PAINFUL

26:15.840 --> 26:16.966
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK
AT YOUR LIFE

26:17.000 --> 26:21.107
AND YOU REALIZE
HOW LITTLE CHOICE
YOU HAD IN IT. RIGHT?

26:23.750 --> 26:24.944
SPENCE, IF THERE'S
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SAY,

26:24.980 --> 26:26.641
JUST SAY IT.

26:26.680 --> 26:27.772
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT
IT'S A LOT LIKE

26:27.820 --> 26:30.641
WHEN JJ AND HOTCH
FAKED YOUR DEATH

26:30.690 --> 26:32.339
SO THAT YOU COULD ESCAPE
FROM IAN DOYLE.

26:32.390 --> 26:33.812
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY
CHOICE IN THE MATTER,

26:33.860 --> 26:35.885
BUT IT'S WHAT
THEY HAD TO DO.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.922
THEY FOUGHT JUST AS HARD
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE

26:37.960 --> 26:40.656
AS YOU DID TO SAVE MINE.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.826
IT'S WHAT WE DO.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.863
IT'S...NOT LIKE THIS.

26:45.900 --> 26:48.368
IT IS. YOU WANT PROOF?
HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.129
MICHAEL LEE PETERSON,
CHAD HIGGINS,

26:50.170 --> 26:51.865
KATHY
AND JESSICA EVANSON,

26:51.910 --> 26:53.309
GLORIA BARKER,
AND DECLAN DOYLE.

26:53.340 --> 26:55.877
THESE ARE MEN,
WOMEN, AND CHILDREN

26:55.910 --> 26:58.845
YOU'VE SAVED AT THE BAU,

26:58.880 --> 27:00.177
PERSONALLY.

27:00.210 --> 27:02.917
BUT THAT'S OUR JOB.

27:02.950 --> 27:04.838
YOURS, MINE,
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

27:04.890 --> 27:05.686
WE SAVE LIVES.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.018
AND HERE ARE 7 MORE
THAT NEED IT NOW.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.858
DAVID ROSSI,
JENNIFER JAREAU,

27:10.890 --> 27:13.324
PENELOPE GARCIA,
LUKE ALVEZ,

27:13.360 --> 27:15.897
MATT SIMMONS,
TARA LEWIS...

27:15.930 --> 27:17.898
AND SPENCER REID.

27:19.300 --> 27:20.790
STOP.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.865
I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND.

27:22.900 --> 27:25.266
AFTER HOTCH LEI-T,
THE TEAM COULD HAVE
IMPLODED.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.199
IT DIDN'T BECAUSE
YOU WERE THERE.

27:28.240 --> 27:31.846
YOU WERE THERE
TO KEEP US TOGETHER.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.110
WE DON'T ALWAYS
HAVE A CHOICE IN
WHAT HAPPENS TO US,

27:34.150 --> 27:35.777
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
SOMETIMES WE DO.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.014
AND RIGHT NOW...

27:39.150 --> 27:41.880
I'M JUST ASKING YOU
TO MAKE THE CHOICE
TO STAY

27:41.920 --> 27:43.353
AND FIGHT FOR US.

27:43.390 --> 27:44.857
YOU KNOW,
FIGHT FOR THE TEAM.

27:44.890 --> 27:47.927
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
WE FIGHT FOR EACH OTHER.

27:58.940 --> 28:01.875
OK.

28:04.750 --> 28:05.876
MM.

28:07.410 --> 28:09.048
LET'S CALL THE TEAM
AND GET BACK TO WORK.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.781
I'M SUSPENDED.

28:12.820 --> 28:14.959
WELL, I'M NOT.
IF YOU JUST
SO HAPPEN TO HEAR

28:14.990 --> 28:16.457
WHAT I HEAR,
THEN SO BE IT.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.009
OK, GARCIA'S FOUND JUSTIN'S
MOST RECENT HOME ADDRESS.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.337
SHE'S SENDING IT TO US NOW.

28:32.370 --> 28:34.838
JJ: GREAT. UM, OK, MATT,
YOU AND DAVE GO TO HIS PLACE.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.336
I'LL GET LUKE AND WE'LL
GO TO HIS OFFICE.

28:36.380 --> 28:38.848
TARA, WILL YOU STAY HERE IN
CASE WE NEED RACHEL AGAIN?

28:38.880 --> 28:40.074
SURE THING.

28:40.110 --> 28:41.247
AGENT JAREAU,
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

28:41.280 --> 28:42.372
SOUNDS GOOD.

28:48.820 --> 28:49.809
HEY.

28:49.860 --> 28:51.054
HEY, JENNIFER.

28:51.090 --> 28:52.250
DID YOU BOTH LOOK
AT THE FILE?

28:53.530 --> 28:55.191
JJ: I THINK
A VALIDATION STRATEGY

28:55.230 --> 28:57.118
LOOKS LIKE THE BEST WAY
TO HANDLE JUSTIN,

28:57.160 --> 28:59.390
ENGAGE HIM BY
BUILDING UP HIS EGO.

28:59.430 --> 29:00.966
REID: THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE WERE THINKING.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.433
NEVER INSULT HIM,
NEVER MENTION THE OTHERS.

29:02.470 --> 29:03.960
IT'S ALL ABOUT HIM
AND HOW GREAT HE IS.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.433
MATT AND DAVE
ARE HEADED TO
JUSTIN'S PLACE NOW.

29:06.470 --> 29:08.506
LUKE, BARNES, AND I
ARE HEADING TO HIS OFFICE.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.337
PRENTISS: WHAT DID BARNES
THINK ABOUT YOUR THEORY?

29:10.380 --> 29:12.348
WELL, YOU KNOW, SHE'S
ON BOARD WITH WHATEVER'S

29:12.380 --> 29:14.371
GONNA SOLVE THE CASE
THE FASTEST.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.844
GLAD TO HEAR
YOUR VOICE, EMILY.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.085
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE
NOT REALLY THERE.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.257
IT'S GREAT TO BE HEARD,

29:21.290 --> 29:22.518
EVEN THOUGH
I'M NOT REALLY HERE.

29:23.930 --> 29:26.387
UH, I GOTTA GO.
TALK TO YOU LATER.

29:26.430 --> 29:29.126
READY?

29:31.330 --> 29:34.538
JUSTIN FRANCO, FBI!

29:36.870 --> 29:38.132
CLEAR!

29:38.170 --> 29:40.138
CLEAR.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.372
DAMN IT.

29:42.410 --> 29:44.947
YEAH, THAT ABOUT
SUMS IT UP.

29:47.050 --> 29:48.039
HUH.

29:49.550 --> 29:52.587
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

29:52.620 --> 29:55.987
THESE LOOK A LOT LIKE
RAY MURPHY'S CLOTHES.

29:56.020 --> 29:57.009
LIKE SIMILAR STYLES?

30:00.560 --> 30:04.064
IS AN EXACT MATCH.

30:04.100 --> 30:07.524
JUSTIN'S BEEN
OBSESSED WITH TRYING
TO BECOME RAY.

30:07.570 --> 30:10.562
YEAH, BUT THAT KIND OF
THING IS USUALLY BRED
OUT OF JEALOUSY.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.500
WHAT DOES HE HAVE
THAT JUSTIN WANTS?

30:12.540 --> 30:14.405
LOVE OF THE FAMILY.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.499
THEN HE WOULD HAVE
JUST KILLED RAY
AND TRIED TO REPLACE HIM.

30:16.540 --> 30:18.849
WELL, MAYBE THERE'S A CLUE
IN WHO HE DIDN'T KILL.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.449
WELL, RACHEL SLEPT
AT HER SISTER'S THAT NIGHT.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.242
JUSTIN MIGHT NOT
HAVE KNOWN THAT

30:27.290 --> 30:29.178
UNTIL HE ARRIVED
AT THE HOUSE.

30:29.220 --> 30:31.381
HIS PLAN'S ALREADY IN
MOTION. HE'S NOT GONNA STOP.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.624
SHE GOT LUCKY.

30:32.660 --> 30:35.128
AND LARRY HAD JUST BEEN
KICKED OUT OF THE HOUSE.

30:35.160 --> 30:38.391
AND JUSTIN KNOWS
THAT MAKES HIM
A PRIMARY SUSPECT.

30:38.430 --> 30:40.967
CORRINE'S IN EUROPE
FOR WORK.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.538
SO, UNLIKE RACHEL,
HE PROBABLY KNOWS
SHE'S NOT HOME.

30:44.570 --> 30:47.437
THAT'S WHY HE DOES IT NOW.
THE TIMING'S PERFECT.

30:47.470 --> 30:50.576
HE CAN FRAME LARRY
AND ENSURE CORRINE'S SAFETY.

30:50.610 --> 30:53.272
SO THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT
PUNISHING THE FAMILY.

30:53.310 --> 30:56.347
IT WAS ALL ABOUT KEEPING
CORRINE FOR HIMSELF.

30:56.380 --> 30:57.517
THEY WERE HIS GREATEST
OBSTACLE TO HER.

30:57.550 --> 30:59.142
THEY PROTECTED HER.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.408
WITH THEM GONE,
JUSTIN'S PATH IS CLEAR.

31:01.460 --> 31:02.484
BUT IT STILL
DOESN'T EXPLAIN

31:02.520 --> 31:05.455
WHY HE'S ATTEMPTING
TO MIRROR RAY.

31:13.270 --> 31:15.488
JUSTIN LOVES CORRINE, RIGHT?

31:18.640 --> 31:20.972
WHAT IF SHE LOVES RAY?

31:22.640 --> 31:25.302
MAYBE HE THINKS TURNING
HIMSELF INTO RAY

31:25.350 --> 31:26.977
IS GONNA GET HER ATTENTION.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.513
WELL, LET'S JUST CHECK
WITH GARCIA...

31:29.550 --> 31:33.884
AND SEE IF THERE WERE
TWO SECRET RELATIONSHIPS
IN THAT HOUSE.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.478
JUSTIN
WASN'T HOME.

31:38.530 --> 31:39.622
HE WASN'T AT WORK EITHER.

31:39.660 --> 31:41.389
HE CALLED IN SICK
THE LAST 3 DAYS.

31:41.430 --> 31:43.057
UH...

31:44.530 --> 31:46.589
IS THE TEAM
ALWAYS LIKE THIS?

31:46.630 --> 31:48.439
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN?

31:48.470 --> 31:50.961
EDGY, COM BATIVE.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.204
HON ESTLY?

31:52.240 --> 31:53.400
OF COURSE.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.476
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU.

31:55.510 --> 31:57.205
WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID
TO THE I.R.T.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.140
WE THINK YOU'RE GONNA
DO IT AGAIN TO THE BAU.

31:59.180 --> 32:01.671
BUT I'M NOT. I WANT
THE SAME THING THEY DO,

32:01.720 --> 32:03.369
THE BEST POSSIBLE FBI.

32:03.420 --> 32:05.945
THEN ENDING THIS TEAM
IS A MISTAKE.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.446
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

32:07.490 --> 32:10.015
THAT'S THE SAME THING
YOU SAID ABOUT THE I.R.T.

32:10.060 --> 32:12.528
I RESPECT THE HELL OUT OF
YOUR PASSION FOR THE FBI.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.994
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
YOU WERE TRANSFERRED
TO THE BAU.

32:15.030 --> 32:17.555
BUT YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THIS.

32:20.770 --> 32:22.658
THANKS, PENELOPE.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.304
GARCIA HASN'T BEEN ABLE
TO FIND ANYTHING

32:24.340 --> 32:26.035
THAT PROVES RAY
AND CORRINE WERE A COUPLE,

32:26.070 --> 32:28.209
SO EITHER THEY WERE
REALLY SMART AT HIDING IT

32:28.240 --> 32:30.708
OR THEY WEREN'T TOGETHER
AND THE CONNECTION
IS ALL IN JUSTIN'S MIND.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.277
ROSSI:
REAL OR PERCEIVED,
IT'S JUSTIN'S TRIGGER.

32:33.310 --> 32:35.744
YEAH. GARCIA WAS ALSO ABLE
TO TRACK DOWN CORRINE'S CAR

32:35.780 --> 32:38.146
TO A LONG-TERM PARKING
GARAGE AT THE AIRPORT.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.441
THAT'S WHERE SHE USUALLY
PARKS FOR WORK.

32:39.490 --> 32:41.151
WELL, JUSTIN
MIGHT KNOW THAT,

32:41.190 --> 32:42.680
AND IF HE DOES,
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

32:42.720 --> 32:43.982
HE'LL BE THERE
WAITING FOR HER.

32:44.030 --> 32:46.453
BARNES: CORRINE'S FLIGHT
IS ABOUT TO LAND.
WE BETTER GET MOVING.

32:46.490 --> 32:48.355
DETECTIVE, HAVE YOUR TEAM
CLEAR OUT THE GARAGE,

32:48.400 --> 32:50.049
HELP SET UP A PERIMETER.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.124
COPY THAT.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.728
DISCRETION IS IMPORTANT.

32:52.770 --> 32:54.135
JUSTIN HAS TO THINK
THAT HE'S IN CONTROL.

32:54.170 --> 32:55.364
IF HE DOESN'T,
HE MAY FLIP OUT

32:55.400 --> 32:56.469
AND WE RISK
HAVING TO SHOOT HIM.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.036
I WANT HIM IN CUSTODY ALIVE.

32:58.070 --> 33:00.129
JUSTIN WILL HAVE
HIS DAY IN COURT.

33:00.170 --> 33:03.298
OK. DAVE, YOU AND MATT
MEET CORRINE ON THE TARMAC

33:03.340 --> 33:06.605
AND BRING HER TO BARNES AND I
AT THE MOBILE COMMAND CENTER.

33:09.350 --> 33:15.482
["ALL UNATTENDED BAGS"
ANNOUNCEMENT ON P.A.]

33:15.520 --> 33:18.648
YEAH. SHOULD BE HOME SOON.

33:18.690 --> 33:20.749
ALL RIGHT.
HE'S AT CORRINE'S CAR.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.758
HE'S GOT HIS HANDS
IN HIS POCKETS.

33:22.800 --> 33:26.566
HE'S LIKELY ARMED.
I'M GONNA POST UP
ABOUT 10 YARDS AWAY.

33:27.470 --> 33:29.597
BARNES: YES, WE DO.
GARCIA JUST FINISHED

33:29.640 --> 33:32.268
HACKING INTO
THE SECURITY CAM.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.333
ALVEZ: DO ROSSI
AND SIMMONS HAVE CORRINE?

33:37.380 --> 33:38.574
THEY'RE BRINGING
HER OVER NOW.

33:44.820 --> 33:46.811
HI. CORRINE, I'M JENNIFER.

33:46.850 --> 33:50.479
SO WE'RE GONNA KEEP YOU SAFE
IN THIS TENT RIGHT HERE.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.078
THERE'S NO WAY JUSTIN
CAN SEE YOU, OK?

33:52.130 --> 33:53.222
CORRINE: OK.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.805
JJ: OK, WE'RE READY.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.579
ALVEZ:
ALL RIGHT. SO ARE WE.

34:08.610 --> 34:10.771
THE CIVILIANS HAVE
ALL CLEARED OUT.

34:10.810 --> 34:12.698
GO ON MY COUNT, TARA.

34:12.750 --> 34:16.538
1, 2, 3...

34:16.580 --> 34:18.616
JUSTIN.

34:18.650 --> 34:19.582
I'M WITH THE FBI.

34:19.620 --> 34:24.648
YOUR PLAN AND EXECUTION
WERE PRETTY FLAWLESS.

34:24.690 --> 34:26.453
WE'D LOVE TO KNOW HOW
YOU CAME UP WITH ALL THIS.

34:26.490 --> 34:29.823
ALVEZ: HEY,
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS.

34:29.860 --> 34:31.794
AAH. AAH!

34:31.830 --> 34:34.230
WE JUST WANT TO
TALK, MAN. THAT'S IT.

34:34.270 --> 34:35.737
WE JUST WANT TO TALK.

34:35.770 --> 34:37.533
THAT'S ALL WE'RE GONNA DO,
RIGHT, JUST TALK?

34:37.570 --> 34:38.832
TARA: ABSOLUTELY.

34:38.870 --> 34:39.837
YOU'RE THE ONE IN CONTROL
HERE, JUSTIN.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.531
THEN I WANT TO TALK
TO CORRINE.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.775
ALVEZ: BUT THE ONLY WAY
WE CAN DO THAT IS
IF YOU PUT DOWN--

34:43.810 --> 34:45.448
I WANT CORRINE NOW!

34:45.480 --> 34:47.243
AND IF YOU DON'T
BRING HER TO ME,

34:47.280 --> 34:48.679
I'LL KILL MYSELF

34:48.720 --> 34:50.449
RIGHT HERE.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.414
GET HER.

34:52.450 --> 34:53.610
WE CAN'T LET HIM
KILL HIMSELF.

34:53.650 --> 34:55.254
WE HAVE TO SEND IN CORRINE.

34:55.290 --> 34:56.882
NO. SHE'S ALREADY SAFE.
I'M NOT RISKING HER LIFE.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.558
IT WORKED ON THAT CASE
IN CENTRAL PARK.

34:58.590 --> 35:00.581
SHE GOT THE KILLER
TO SURRENDER
BEFORE ANYBODY DIED.

35:00.630 --> 35:02.257
THAT WAS DIFFERENT, OK?

35:02.300 --> 35:03.756
THIS GUY IS
A NARCISSIST.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.621
HE WON'T KILL HIMSELF.
HE WILL ONLY
TRY TO SHOOT HER.

35:06.670 --> 35:07.864
SO IF WE WANT
JUSTIN ALIVE,

35:07.900 --> 35:11.131
WE HAVE TO LET TARA
AND LUKE TALK HIM DOWN.

35:11.170 --> 35:12.603
TARA: PUT THE GUN DOWN.

35:12.640 --> 35:16.770
JUSTIN: I WANT TO SEE CORRINE!

35:16.810 --> 35:22.168
YOU PUT DOWN THE GUN
AND WALK US THROUGH
YOUR PLAN,

35:22.220 --> 35:23.744
EVERY STEP.

35:23.780 --> 35:27.409
LEWIS: ONLY YOU CAN
TELL US EVERYTHING WE
NEED TO KNOW, JUSTIN.

35:30.790 --> 35:32.257
ROSSI:
WHAT THE HELL?

35:32.290 --> 35:34.554
BARNES: JUSTIN!

35:34.600 --> 35:37.899
I BROUGHT CORRINE
LIKE YOU WANTED.

35:37.930 --> 35:41.263
SIMMONS: WHAT IS SHE DOING?

35:41.300 --> 35:42.289
WE GOTTA GET CORRINE.

35:42.340 --> 35:43.864
CORRINE.

35:43.900 --> 35:48.906
WITH EVERYBODY GONE,
WE COULD HAVE FINALLY
BEEN TOGETHER.

35:48.940 --> 35:51.841
BUT YOU HAD TO CALL
THE COPS.

35:54.250 --> 35:55.217
JUSTIN.

35:55.250 --> 35:56.615
I DID THIS FOR US

35:56.650 --> 35:59.517
AND YOU SPIT IN MY FACE!

36:07.390 --> 36:09.597
THE VEST CAUGHT THE BULLET.

36:09.630 --> 36:11.860
OK, SO THAT'S GONNA LEAVE
A NICE LITTLE BRUISE FOR YOU,

36:11.900 --> 36:13.367
BUT I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.867
YOU THINK YOU CAN GET UP?

36:14.900 --> 36:15.889
I THINK SO.

36:15.940 --> 36:17.396
OK, MATT HERE WILL HELP YOU.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.805
WE GOT A MEDIC WAITING.

36:19.810 --> 36:21.471
OK.

36:23.940 --> 36:25.646
YOU WENT AROUND US?

36:25.680 --> 36:27.170
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

36:43.330 --> 36:44.968
THOSE SECURITY CAMERAS
CAUGHT EVERYTHING.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.888
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW IT'LL LOOK
WHEN THIS GOES VIRAL?

36:46.930 --> 36:49.364
I HAD A PLAN.
NOBODY WAS GOING TO DIE.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.402
IF YOU FOLLOWED
OUR VALIDATION STRATEGY...

36:51.440 --> 36:53.965
BARNES: IT WASN'T WORKING.
IT WAS MOVING TOO SLOW.

36:54.010 --> 36:55.409
IT TAKES TIME TO UNFOLD.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.930
NO! NO, THIS IS ON YOU.

36:56.980 --> 36:59.642
JUSTIN'S BLOOD
IS ON ALL OF YOU.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.545
I WILL MAKE SURE
THAT MY REPORT SAYS SO.

37:01.580 --> 37:03.241
THEN LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT MY REPORT WILL SAY.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.487
THAT WE AGREED ON A THEORY
TO ENGAGE JUSTIN

37:05.520 --> 37:07.909
BASED ON OUR PROFILE,
WHICH WAS WORKING

37:07.950 --> 37:08.985
UNTIL YOU WENT ROGUE.

37:09.020 --> 37:11.011
AND IN DOING SO,
YOU RISKED THE LIFE

37:11.060 --> 37:12.789
OF A WOMAN
WE HAD ALREADY SAVED

37:12.830 --> 37:15.253
AND FORCED US TO KILL
OUR PRIME SUSPECT.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.325
WHY DON'T WE SHOW
THE VIDEO TO THE DIRECTOR

37:17.360 --> 37:18.861
AND LET HIM DECIDE?

37:18.900 --> 37:20.026
I THINK THAT'S
A GREAT IDEA.

37:20.070 --> 37:22.630
YOU JUST TELL ME
WHEN TO BE THERE.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.001
I TRIED MY BEST HERE.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.338
YOU COULDN'T JUST
LET ME HELP.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.701
JJ: WE'VE KNOWN
FROM THE MOMENT YOU
STARTED WITH PRENTISS

37:31.750 --> 37:33.809
THAT YOU'VE WANTED
TO SHUT DOWN THE BAU,

37:33.850 --> 37:35.715
THE SAME WAY
YOU SHUT DOWN THE I.R.T.

37:35.750 --> 37:38.514
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?
KEEP TAKING YOUR BEST SHOT.

37:38.550 --> 37:41.986
AND MAYBE YOU WILL GET US.

37:42.020 --> 37:45.524
BUT WE'RE DAMN SURE
GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN, TOO.

38:06.750 --> 38:10.413
ROSSI: I THINK YOU JUST EARNED
YOUR STRIPES, CHIEF.

38:16.660 --> 38:18.480
WHERE DO THESE GO?

38:18.530 --> 38:21.021
UH, ON THE SHELF OVER THERE.

38:22.530 --> 38:25.465
DID I EVER TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT GUY IN
CALIFORNIA WHO ONLY HAS--

38:25.500 --> 38:28.025
78 THINGS. YEAH.
4 TIMES ALREADY.

38:28.070 --> 38:30.959
WELL, IT JUST
SO HAPPENS THAT I
JUST READ AN ARTICLE

38:31.000 --> 38:33.059
THAT SAYS HE'S DOWN
TO 75. YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE?

38:34.580 --> 38:36.332
OH--

38:36.380 --> 38:37.904
SAVED BY THE BELL.

38:40.110 --> 38:43.079
OK. WHO'S UP FOR DRINKS
AT O'KEEFE'S?

38:43.120 --> 38:44.417
I'M IN.

38:44.450 --> 38:45.781
LEWIS:
OH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

38:45.820 --> 38:47.583
ALVEZ: YEAH, IT SOUNDS
GREAT TO ME, TOO.

38:47.620 --> 38:50.009
THE KIDS ARE ASLEEP.
WIFE COULD USE
A SECOND ALONE. I'M IN.

38:50.060 --> 38:51.527
DID SOMEONE SAY O'KEEFE'S?

38:51.560 --> 38:53.528
WHERE HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN?
YOU'RE 20 MINUTES LATE.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.494
OUR FLIGHT GOT DELAYED.

38:55.530 --> 38:57.395
UH, OK. COOL, GUYS.

38:57.430 --> 38:58.966
THE RADAR DID NOT
REPORT ANY WEATHER.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.422
YEAH, IT WASN'T WEATHER.

39:00.470 --> 39:02.438
UNLESS YOU COUNT
HURRICANE JAREAU.

39:02.470 --> 39:04.438
GARCIA: OHH! OH,
I'M NOT UP TO SPEED.

39:04.470 --> 39:05.835
I HATE IT WHEN I'M
NOT UP TO SPEED.

39:05.870 --> 39:08.930
JJ RIPPED INTO BARNES
BEFORE WE TOOK OFF.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.777
MAMA BEAR HAS GOT BITE.

39:10.810 --> 39:13.938
SHE'S LUCKY I DIDN'T
THROW HER OFF THE JET.

39:13.980 --> 39:15.379
WHERE'S THE OLD BATTLE AX NOW?

39:15.420 --> 39:17.069
PROBABLY UPSTAIRS
LICKING HER WOUNDS.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.985
LINDA BARNES IS A FIGHTER.

39:19.020 --> 39:20.112
SHE'S NOT FINISHED
BY A LONG SHOT.

39:20.150 --> 39:23.483
ROSSI: WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
I'M GLAD WE WON THIS ROUND.

39:23.520 --> 39:26.683
MM, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

39:26.730 --> 39:28.698
OHH! SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!

39:28.730 --> 39:30.095
ROSSI: YOU FEELING
BETTER, KID?

39:30.130 --> 39:31.392
MUCH BETTER.
THANK YOU.

39:31.430 --> 39:32.465
WAIT. YOU'RE SUSPENDED.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.058
HOW DID YOU GET--
DID YOU SNEAK IN?

39:34.100 --> 39:35.465
DID YOU DO A SECRET
NINJA

39:35.500 --> 39:36.797
TELL ME.
I HAVE TO KNOW.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.138
I, UM,
I HAVE ONE OF THESE.

39:39.170 --> 39:40.637
I'M REID'S VISITOR.

39:40.670 --> 39:43.673
OH, WELL, WELCOME
TO THE BAU, VISITOR.

39:43.710 --> 39:46.770
IT'S A GREAT PLACE
YOU'VE GOT HERE.

39:46.810 --> 39:48.710
DID I HEAR SOMETHING
ABOUT DRINKS?

39:48.750 --> 39:51.139
YES. AND I AM BUYING
THE FIRST ROUND.

39:51.180 --> 39:52.886
YOU HEARD THE MA--

39:52.920 --> 39:56.185
BARNES: AGENT PRENTISS, AGENT
REID, I'M HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

39:56.220 --> 39:58.723
AGENT JAREAU, I DIDN'T GET
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TELL YOU

39:58.760 --> 40:00.625
HOW MUCH I ENJOYED
YOUR SPEECH ON THE JET.

40:00.660 --> 40:02.491
BUT YOU'RE WRONG THAT I'M
HERE TO SHUT DOWN THE BAU,

40:02.530 --> 40:03.997
BECAUSE I'M NOT.

40:04.030 --> 40:06.999
THIS UNIT IS THE CROWN JEWEL
OF BEHAVIORAL PROFILING.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.191
I COULDN'T SHUT IT DOWN
IF I WANTED TO.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.458
BUT I CAN HELP RESTRUCTURE IT.

40:11.510 --> 40:13.102
THE DIRECTOR WATCHED
THE AIRPORT VIDEO,

40:13.140 --> 40:15.677
AND HE FELT, AS I DID,
THAT WE WERE IN PUBLIC

40:15.710 --> 40:17.678
AND YOUR VALIDATION
STRATEGY WAS FAILING.

40:17.710 --> 40:18.904
YOU ALREADY MET WITH HIM?

40:18.950 --> 40:20.645
YES. I'VE KNOWN HIM
A LONG TIME.

40:20.680 --> 40:22.045
HE ANSWERS MY CALLS.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.877
I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE
TO FILE MY REPORT.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.717
BARNES: HE AGREED THAT EVENTS
SHOULD HAVE UNFOLDED QUICKER,

40:25.750 --> 40:28.184
AND BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T,
THE SUSPECT DIED.

40:28.220 --> 40:30.188
NOW WE NEED TO ENSURE
THAT MISTAKES,

40:30.220 --> 40:32.586
LIKES THE ONES
YOU MADE TODAY,
NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

40:32.630 --> 40:33.824
MISTAKES WE MADE?

40:33.860 --> 40:36.522
THAT SAID, AGENT PRENTISS,

40:36.560 --> 40:38.096
YOUR SUSPENSION IS LII-TED.

40:38.130 --> 40:40.098
YOU'LL BE REASSIGNED
WITHIN THE BUREAU.

40:40.130 --> 40:41.836
YOUR NEW POST HAS YET
TO BE DETERMINED.

40:41.870 --> 40:43.758
GARCIA: WHAT?

40:43.800 --> 40:46.837
AGENT LEWIS, YOU WILL
ALSO BE REASSIGNED.

40:46.870 --> 40:48.929
AGENT REID, YOU WILL BE
A FULL-TIME PROFESSOR

40:48.980 --> 40:50.709
WITH OUR EXCHANGE
PROGRAM.

AGENT ROSSI, THE FBI
DEEPLY APPRECIATES
YOUR SERVICE,

40:54.780 --> 40:56.611
AND THE DIRECTOR
WISHES YOU NOTHING
BUT THE BEST

40:56.650 --> 40:59.949
IN YOUR RETIREMENT.

40:59.990 --> 41:02.049
AGENT SIMMONS,

41:02.090 --> 41:03.887
YOU WILL REMAIN HERE
AT THE BAU.

GARCIA, YOUR LOYALTY TO
THE TEAM IS APPRECIATED,

41:06.990 --> 41:08.184
BUT IT FEELS LIKE
A FRESH START

41:08.230 --> 41:10.926
IN A DIFFERENT
DEPARTMENT WOULD BE BEST.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.564
FRESH START?
I DON'T WANT A FRESH START.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.227
I NEED--I NEED TO BE HERE.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.229

41:23.610 --> 41:24.645
THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.102
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE WASN'T.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.777
BUT I WAS ABLE WITH
THE DIRECTOR'S APPROVAL

41:27.810 --> 41:29.744
TO CREATE A NEW POSITION
JUST FOR YOU.

41:29.780 --> 41:31.589
I WON'T BE GOING INTO
THE FIELD WITH YOU ANYMORE,

41:31.620 --> 41:34.248
BUT YOU WILL RUN EVERY
DECISION PAST ME,
BIG AND SMALL,

41:34.290 --> 41:36.588
BEFORE YOU ACT.

41:38.890 --> 41:40.881
GOOD NIGHT.

41:52.310 --> 41:55.609
