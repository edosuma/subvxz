'If anyone finds this,
it means that my plan didn't work ...

01:21.117 --> 01:23.870
... and I'm already dead.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.497
- Evan?
- I think he's in here.

01:26.581 --> 01:31.169
If I can somehow
go back to the beginning ...

01:31.252 --> 01:34.130
... of all of this, I might be able ...
- Evan!

01:35.923 --> 01:38.301
... to save her.'

01:38.384 --> 01:40.511
Evan!

02:25.973 --> 02:28.100
Evan!

02:32.313 --> 02:34.189
We're gonna be
late again.

02:34.273 --> 02:37.484
When did you ever care
about getting to school on time?

02:37.568 --> 02:40.029
We're putting up pictures
for parents' night.

02:40.112 --> 02:42.781
Don't worry,
you'll have plenty of time.

02:44.992 --> 02:46.660
Is Dad gonna come?

02:46.744 --> 02:48.579
You know the answer to that.

02:48.662 --> 02:51.039
Can't he just
come out for one day?

02:51.123 --> 02:53.083
We've been over this 100 times.

02:53.167 --> 02:54.835
It's too dangerous for him.

02:54.918 --> 02:57.087
But Lenny said
his dad's coming,

02:57.171 --> 02:59.089
and Tommy
and Kayleigh's dad ...

02:59.173 --> 03:01.758
Okay, I get the point.

03:01.842 --> 03:03.760
But I'm not so bad, am I?

03:03.844 --> 03:05.512
No.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.445
Okay, have a great day.

03:21.528 --> 03:23.822
I love you.
I'll pick you up later. Gotta go.

03:25.866 --> 03:27.576
Bye.

03:30.245 --> 03:32.205
Bye!

03:34.708 --> 03:36.585
Mrs. Treborn, I need
to speak with you.

03:36.668 --> 03:38.962
Can it wait till tonight?
I'm late for work and ...

03:39.045 --> 03:41.673
I think you really
need to see this.

03:43.508 --> 03:45.635
Tommy, leave Lenny alone.

03:45.719 --> 03:47.887
Don't make me send you
to Mr. Voytek's office.

03:49.556 --> 03:51.391
I was gonna show this
to the principal,

03:51.474 --> 03:53.268
but I thought I should
talk to you first.

03:53.351 --> 03:54.519
What is it?

03:54.602 --> 03:56.604
Yesterday I had all the children
make drawings

03:56.688 --> 03:58.523
of what they wanted to be
when they grew up.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.984
Most of them made drawings
of what their parents did.

04:01.067 --> 04:02.736
But this ...

04:12.287 --> 04:14.581
I don't understand.

04:14.664 --> 04:16.708
Evan did this?

04:18.834 --> 04:21.879
- Can I keep this drawing?
- Oh, of course.

04:21.963 --> 04:23.840
Um, there is one more thing,
Mrs. Treborn,

04:23.923 --> 04:27.010
- I feel bad even mentioning.
- What?

04:27.093 --> 04:28.970
When I asked Evan
about the drawing,

04:29.053 --> 04:32.724
well, he couldn't
remember doing it.

04:40.940 --> 04:43.234
I don't wanna go.

04:44.527 --> 04:46.904
I don't like this place, Mum.

04:46.988 --> 04:48.906
I think it's creepy.

04:50.116 --> 04:52.493
I promise I won't
make any bad pictures.

04:52.577 --> 04:54.871
You're gonna be fine, okay?

04:54.954 --> 04:57.456
He just wants to do
a couple tests, that's all.

04:57.540 --> 04:59.750
- Oh.
- You'll like him.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.715
That's good.
You're doing great.

05:05.798 --> 05:08.926
Just tell me he hasn't inherited
his father's illness.

05:09.010 --> 05:11.387
I'm sure the test results
will come back negative.

05:11.470 --> 05:14.098
But there's something else you can do
to monitor his memory.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.934
- Anything.
- A journal.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.395
Just have him write down
everything that he does.

05:19.478 --> 05:22.231
- And what will that do?
- It could help jog his memory.

05:22.314 --> 05:25.109
See if he remembers
anything new the next day.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.611
These test results
will come back in a few days

05:27.695 --> 05:29.780
- and we'll take it from there.
- Okay.

05:29.864 --> 05:34.410
'Today Mummy is taking me
to play with Kayleigh and Tommy.

05:34.493 --> 05:37.538
I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.'

05:40.457 --> 05:42.626
Great, see you soon.

05:53.846 --> 05:56.140
Evan ...

05:56.223 --> 05:59.268
Evan, what are you doing
with that knife?

06:07.776 --> 06:09.653
What happened?

06:09.736 --> 06:11.989
Honey ...

06:12.072 --> 06:14.283
what were you doing
with that knife?

06:16.785 --> 06:18.203
I don't remember.

06:29.548 --> 06:32.175
- Hey, Andrea.
- George.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.302
Hello, little man.

06:34.386 --> 06:36.513
Watch your step.

06:40.809 --> 06:42.394
Thanks, George.

06:42.477 --> 06:45.313
- Not a problem.
- Here's my work number

06:45.397 --> 06:47.107
in case there are
any problems.

06:47.190 --> 06:49.651
And please keep
an eye on him 'cause ...

06:49.734 --> 06:51.194
What, are you kidding?

06:51.278 --> 06:53.571
We're going to have
a great time today, right, sport?

06:53.655 --> 06:56.199
Okay, be good, kiddo.

06:56.283 --> 06:57.617
I love you.

06:57.701 --> 06:59.119
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, George.

07:00.495 --> 07:02.497
Go long. Go on.
Right in the backyard.

07:02.580 --> 07:03.957
Here it comes.

07:06.584 --> 07:09.087
Evan, Evan, guess what?
Dad got a new video camera

07:09.170 --> 07:11.047
and we're all going
to be in a movie.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.174
That's right, Evan.

07:13.258 --> 07:16.594
And you get to be the star.

07:16.678 --> 07:18.263
I thought I was the star.

07:18.346 --> 07:19.597
Hey, what did I tell you?

07:21.057 --> 07:22.767
Now, Evan ...

07:22.851 --> 07:25.144
You have to promise

07:25.228 --> 07:28.856
your bestest,
super-duper promise

07:28.940 --> 07:31.234
that this will be
our little secret.

07:31.317 --> 07:34.529
- You think you can do that?
- Um-hmm.

07:34.612 --> 07:36.030
I'm r ...

07:43.329 --> 07:45.039
Where am I?

07:45.123 --> 07:46.833
Where did we all go?

07:46.916 --> 07:48.876
Calm down, kid, stand still.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.670
I was just somewhere else.

07:50.753 --> 07:52.255
How did I get here?

07:52.338 --> 07:55.424
Quit acting like some damn retard,
or I'll call your mother

07:55.508 --> 07:58.511
and tell her what a naughty
little shit you've been.

08:00.638 --> 08:02.056
Kayleigh ...

08:02.139 --> 08:04.267
Kayleigh ...

08:04.350 --> 08:06.727
what happened?

08:16.654 --> 08:19.490
The good news is
the results are negative.

08:19.573 --> 08:21.492
I found no evidence of lesions,

08:21.575 --> 08:22.910
haemorrhaging, tumours.

08:22.993 --> 08:25.329
But you must have
something you can go on.

08:25.413 --> 08:28.332
If I was to guess, I'd say
the blackouts are stress related.

08:28.415 --> 08:30.459
But he's seven years old.

08:30.543 --> 08:33.169
What kind of stress
can a seven-year-old have?

08:33.254 --> 08:36.131
Plenty. Maybe he has
severe coping problems

08:36.215 --> 08:37.841
about not having a father.

08:37.924 --> 08:40.177
You said the last time
the blackouts occurred

08:40.260 --> 08:42.096
he was visiting
his friend's dad.

08:43.931 --> 08:47.476
Well, he has been pushing me
to meet his father

08:47.559 --> 08:51.021
- and I've been putting it off.
- It's worth a shot, Andrea.

08:51.105 --> 08:53.357
We can arrange
a controlled meeting.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.860
A careful dose of sedatives
for Jason, some security,

08:56.944 --> 08:58.946
Evan comes in
for a quick visit,

08:59.029 --> 09:00.656
and with a little luck,

09:00.739 --> 09:03.158
no more
missing father complex.

09:07.079 --> 09:09.081
'April 15th.

09:09.164 --> 09:11.291
Today I get to meet my father.

09:11.375 --> 09:14.294
His name is Jason
and he's crazy.

09:14.378 --> 09:16.630
I hope he lets me
call him Dad.'

09:19.633 --> 09:21.635
You mean Dad lives here?

09:21.718 --> 09:23.679
Not in this wing, actually, no.

09:23.762 --> 09:25.639
Now if your dad seems
a little sleepy,

09:25.722 --> 09:27.891
it's because
of the medicine, okay?

09:27.975 --> 09:29.267
Okay.

09:32.145 --> 09:34.064
It'll just be a moment, okay?

10:05.220 --> 10:07.555
It's okay. I won't bite.

10:09.099 --> 10:11.393
You've seen pictures
of me, right?

10:11.476 --> 10:14.646
Uh-huh. Mum says
I have your smile

10:14.729 --> 10:17.148
and your hair.

10:19.609 --> 10:20.985
Nooo!

10:22.987 --> 10:25.240
He has to die!
It's the only way!

10:25.323 --> 10:27.825
Jason, stop!

10:27.909 --> 10:29.369
No!

10:31.663 --> 10:34.207
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be alright.

10:34.290 --> 10:37.168
He's hurt bad.
Get a stretcher.

10:38.461 --> 10:40.672
- Come on, let's get him out of here.
- I'm so sorry.

10:40.755 --> 10:43.091
In sure and certain hope

10:43.174 --> 10:45.593
of the resurrection
to eternal life,

10:45.677 --> 10:48.805
we commend to almighty God,
our brother Jason.

10:48.888 --> 10:51.265
The Lord bless him
and keep him,

10:51.349 --> 10:54.102
the Lord make his face
to shine upon him,

10:54.185 --> 10:56.395
and be gracious unto him

10:56.479 --> 10:59.440
and give him peace. Amen.

11:37.603 --> 11:41.649
Come on, where is it?
Damn, I know it's down here somewhere.

11:41.732 --> 11:44.193
Tommy, I'm bored shitless
over here. What's up already?

11:44.276 --> 11:46.195
Yeah, what are you
looking for, anyway?

11:46.278 --> 11:49.531
Shut up, lard arse. And you,
hold your fucking horses.

11:49.615 --> 11:51.700
You know,
it's here somewhere.

11:51.784 --> 11:53.994
We should go soon.

11:54.078 --> 11:56.747
If dad catches us smoking
down here, we're dead.

11:56.830 --> 11:59.208
So let's go.

12:01.168 --> 12:04.088
I knew Dad had
a blockbuster down here!

12:04.171 --> 12:06.131
Let's blow the shit
out of something.

12:15.849 --> 12:17.935
Here you go, buddy.

12:18.018 --> 12:19.561
What? No freaking way.

12:19.645 --> 12:22.564
- I'm not touching this thing.
- The hell you aren't.

12:22.648 --> 12:25.400
Any of us does it and you're gonna
puss out and nark for sure.

12:25.484 --> 12:28.236
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy.
Look how small this fuse is.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.739
- I'll get killed.
- Not necessarily.

12:34.117 --> 12:36.161
There you go.

12:36.244 --> 12:38.705
It should buy you
two minutes at least.

12:38.789 --> 12:40.374
Gee thanks, friend.

12:49.758 --> 12:52.302
Aw, for Christ's sake,
Lenny, you moron, just do it.

13:04.105 --> 13:07.233
- Thanks.
- You got balls, man.

13:07.317 --> 13:09.235
Shit took you long enough.

13:37.347 --> 13:39.057
What the hell? Come on!

13:39.140 --> 13:41.100
Evan, come on.
Help me get him up!

13:41.184 --> 13:43.436
Evan, get your arse back here
and help me get him up.

13:43.519 --> 13:45.188
What the hell happened?
Where are we?

13:45.271 --> 13:47.273
Oh my God.
What did we do?

13:47.357 --> 13:49.942
Evan, come on. Help me.

13:50.026 --> 13:52.195
Oh my God, how could we?

13:52.278 --> 13:54.864
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit, Lenny, what happened to you?

13:54.947 --> 13:56.616
He's fine.
He's gonna be okay.

13:56.699 --> 13:58.534
Everything's gonna be fine.

13:58.618 --> 14:00.828
What's wrong with him?
Why isn't he speaking?

14:00.912 --> 14:02.705
He's in shock, ma'am.

14:06.876 --> 14:08.878
What is it?
What happened?

14:08.961 --> 14:11.047
We were just in the woods
building a fort

14:11.130 --> 14:13.341
when Lenny freaked out.
One minute he was okay,

14:13.424 --> 14:15.635
and then he just froze up.
Right, guys?

14:15.718 --> 14:18.012
What happened, Evan?
The truth.

14:18.095 --> 14:20.139
I don't know.
I don't remember.

14:20.222 --> 14:23.309
Something must have happened.
Something set him off.

14:23.392 --> 14:25.686
I blacked it out.

14:25.770 --> 14:28.731
Don't try to use your blackouts
to get out of this one.

14:34.570 --> 14:36.530
You're not making it up?

14:44.413 --> 14:46.332
I don't know.

14:46.415 --> 14:49.335
They're keeping him
overnight for observation.

14:49.418 --> 14:51.003
Uh-huh.

14:51.086 --> 14:53.881
I just don't know
what to do with him.

14:58.719 --> 15:01.180
'The last thing
I remember before the blackout

15:01.263 --> 15:04.058
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

15:04.141 --> 15:06.185
I think I was more focused
on her hands on mine

15:06.268 --> 15:08.562
than the mailbox
across the street.

15:08.645 --> 15:11.690
Mum thinks that hypnosis
might be a good way to remember.'

15:26.955 --> 15:28.582
Damn it.

16:27.432 --> 16:30.602
Breathe in and breathe out.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.353
And relax.

16:32.437 --> 16:35.607
You are completely asleep.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.317
Relaxed.

16:38.526 --> 16:40.320
I want you to take me
to the time

16:40.403 --> 16:42.780
you were in the woods
with Lenny.

16:42.864 --> 16:45.158
Think of it like a movie.

16:45.241 --> 16:47.702
You can pause, rewind,

16:47.785 --> 16:51.247
or slow down
any details you wish.

16:51.331 --> 16:53.750
Understand?

16:54.834 --> 16:56.419
Yes.

16:56.502 --> 16:58.504
Where are you now?

17:00.006 --> 17:02.008
I'm standing next to Kayleigh.

17:02.091 --> 17:04.635
My hands are over her ears.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.304
Are you hurting her?

17:06.387 --> 17:09.223
No, I'm protecting her.

17:09.307 --> 17:11.309
Okay.

17:11.392 --> 17:15.354
Now let's move forward in time.
What do you see?

17:18.816 --> 17:20.859
I see a car.

17:22.569 --> 17:25.615
Yes, Evan,
tell me about the car.

17:26.699 --> 17:28.659
Go on.

17:28.743 --> 17:31.120
Nothing can hurt you.

17:32.621 --> 17:36.500
Remember, it's only a movie.
You are completely safe.

17:36.584 --> 17:39.003
I can't ...

17:39.086 --> 17:41.130
The car vanishes
and all of a sudden

17:41.213 --> 17:43.090
I'm on the ground
in the woods.

17:43.174 --> 17:44.550
The car doesn't vanish, Evan.

17:44.633 --> 17:47.678
The movie in your head
is broken, that's all.

17:47.761 --> 17:49.847
Now tell me about the car.

17:49.930 --> 17:51.515
I can't!

17:51.599 --> 17:54.059
It's coming ...

17:54.143 --> 17:56.186
Fight it, Evan, hurry.

17:56.270 --> 17:58.188
It's coming!

17:58.272 --> 18:00.190
- Oh my God!
- On the count of 10,

18:00.274 --> 18:03.110
- you'll wake up feeling refreshed ...
- What are you doing?

18:03.193 --> 18:05.779
... and remembering everything
that we talked about.

18:05.863 --> 18:07.323
What is happening?
Make it stop!

18:07.406 --> 18:11.118
One, you're feeling awake. Two,
your eyes are not feeling as heavy.

18:11.201 --> 18:12.536
- Five, six.
- Wake up!

18:12.619 --> 18:15.581
- Come on, Evan, wake up! Nine, 10.
- Wake up!

18:17.458 --> 18:19.668
Oh God.

18:22.629 --> 18:24.465
What happened?

18:24.548 --> 18:25.966
Did it work?

18:33.348 --> 18:35.392
Alright, thanks, Mum.
See you later.

18:44.192 --> 18:46.028
Wipe that sad-arse look
off your face

18:46.111 --> 18:47.821
before you get us busted.

18:47.904 --> 18:50.157
Did you see the way Evan's mum
was looking at you?

18:50.240 --> 18:52.075
Sorry.

18:55.954 --> 18:57.831
Alright, will someone
tell me already

18:57.914 --> 18:59.791
what the hell happened
with the mailbox?

19:02.335 --> 19:04.546
Don't you ever
bring that shit up again.

19:04.629 --> 19:06.798
Not ever!

19:12.345 --> 19:14.431
Let's go.

19:17.434 --> 19:19.144
Are you okay?

19:33.158 --> 19:34.784
Holy shit!

19:34.868 --> 19:36.828
Look at that fat fuck!

19:36.911 --> 19:39.080
He's got bigger titties
than Lenny's mum.

19:39.164 --> 19:42.083
- Shhh!
- Shut up, faggot.

19:42.167 --> 19:44.627
No one's talking to you.

20:08.192 --> 20:10.820
I'm sorry, Kayleigh,
this was a bad idea.

20:10.903 --> 20:14.240
You really don't remember
anything that happened?

20:16.033 --> 20:17.618
You're so lucky.

20:17.702 --> 20:19.412
Look, everything's
gonna be okay.

20:19.495 --> 20:22.665
Lenny'll be fine. You'll see.

20:23.958 --> 20:25.543
Sorry.

20:25.626 --> 20:27.878
It's not your fault.
Mrs. Kagan called Dad

20:27.962 --> 20:29.797
and blamed us
for what happened to Lenny.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.966
Your dad did that?

20:32.049 --> 20:35.970
- I deserve a lot worse.
- What are you talking about?

20:36.053 --> 20:38.180
What you deserve is
a better father and brother.

20:38.264 --> 20:40.599
All they do is
make you feel like shit.

20:43.352 --> 20:45.896
You really have no clue
how beautiful you are, do you?

20:57.116 --> 20:59.285
What the fuck are you doing?!

20:59.368 --> 21:02.079
Buying popcorn.
What the fuck are you doing?

21:02.162 --> 21:05.416
- Whoops.
- I can't believe you freaking did that.

21:05.499 --> 21:08.669
- He's a little punk.
- Why are you being such a dick?

21:13.757 --> 21:15.884
I can't believe
what you just did.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.683
Stop it!

21:22.766 --> 21:24.143
Stop hitting him.

21:24.226 --> 21:26.186
What's wrong with you?

21:28.272 --> 21:30.649
Somebody, please help us.

21:30.732 --> 21:33.569
Alright, that's it, kid.
You're out of here.

21:36.780 --> 21:40.867
Get him away! Get him away!

21:40.951 --> 21:44.371
Now in another story,
the peaceful town of Briarville

21:44.454 --> 21:46.123
was rocked this afternoon

21:46.206 --> 21:48.709
in the wake of a horrible
act of vandalism.

21:48.792 --> 21:51.378
While police officials
in upstate New York believe

21:51.461 --> 21:54.214
this was a simple act
of criminal mischief gone awry,

21:54.297 --> 21:57.509
the tragedy has clearly
devastated the community.

21:57.592 --> 22:01.179
Now this was the grisly aftermath
of a powerful explosion

22:01.263 --> 22:04.850
believed to have been caused
by an unknown quantity of dynamite.

22:04.933 --> 22:08.854
The police have no leads,
no suspects and no motive ...

22:26.663 --> 22:28.289
Good night.

22:38.091 --> 22:40.135
We're moving.

22:57.860 --> 23:00.029
I can't believe
Tommy's still pissed at me.

23:00.113 --> 23:02.448
He knows
I'm moving away, right?

23:02.532 --> 23:04.951
He's been acting
real strange lately.

23:05.034 --> 23:07.620
He won't even look me
in the eyes anymore.

23:07.704 --> 23:09.622
Duck, here they come!

23:15.378 --> 23:18.256
Did your mum say
if Lenny was okay?

23:20.091 --> 23:23.511
He must be. I mean,
they're letting him out, right?

23:47.493 --> 23:48.994
Welcome home.

23:49.078 --> 23:51.664
I thought you might like
some fresh air for a change.

23:51.747 --> 23:55.876
- Is Tommy with you guys?
- No. It's cool.

24:06.095 --> 24:08.055
So, what'd you do in there?

24:08.138 --> 24:10.432
It was awful.
You can't sleep because

24:10.516 --> 24:12.601
everybody's screaming
all night long.

24:14.395 --> 24:16.397
I never want to go back.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.898
Do you see that?

24:17.982 --> 24:20.025
Yeah, what's up
with the smoke?

24:43.298 --> 24:45.217
Crockett!

24:45.300 --> 24:46.969
What are you doing
with my dog?!

24:51.974 --> 24:54.726
- Look what you made me do!
- What the hell's wrong with you?!

25:09.491 --> 25:12.953
Kayleigh. Oh, God, come on,
please wake up.

25:13.036 --> 25:15.747
Wake up, please!
Wake up!

25:15.831 --> 25:18.583
Why don't you fucking kiss her,
Prince Charming?

25:29.511 --> 25:32.013
Ow.

25:34.641 --> 25:36.768
How long was I out?

25:39.396 --> 25:41.231
Kayleigh, what's wrong?

25:45.860 --> 25:48.404
Oh shit.

26:39.288 --> 26:41.457
I'm sorry.

27:09.401 --> 27:11.153
Aced it.

27:11.237 --> 27:13.697
And time.
Put your pencils down

27:13.781 --> 27:17.201
and place your bluebooks
on my desk before you leave.

27:17.284 --> 27:21.038
You too, Mr. Nelson. We're all
in the same time-zone, here.

27:21.121 --> 27:22.957
So how'd you do, Evan?

27:23.040 --> 27:25.709
I don't know. I might have got
some of the stories mixed up.

27:25.793 --> 27:29.171
Was it Pavlov that conditioned
his dog to lick his nuts?

27:31.298 --> 27:34.218
Typical psych major,
a complete wise-arse.

27:34.301 --> 27:35.928
And how's your project coming?

27:36.011 --> 27:38.764
Are you still planning to change
the way we humble scientists

27:38.847 --> 27:42.267
- view memory assimilation?
- Don't really have a choice.

28:11.671 --> 28:14.591
Oh, jeez, it smells like
patchouli and arse in here.

28:14.674 --> 28:18.094
Cricket, this is my well-mannered
roommate, Evan.

28:18.178 --> 28:19.763
Yeah ...

28:19.846 --> 28:21.973
you're the one
that fucked up the bell curve

28:22.057 --> 28:23.934
on my anthropology final.

28:24.017 --> 28:25.977
- Later, Thumper.
- Bye.

28:26.061 --> 28:28.271
Fucking dick.

28:28.355 --> 28:30.982
- Wow, sweet girl, man.
- I found your shirt, bro'.

28:32.192 --> 28:34.110
Oh, you sick fuck.

28:35.695 --> 28:39.157
Alright, man, get dressed.
You're taking me out.

28:39.240 --> 28:41.576
Why, what'd you do,
ace another midterm?

28:41.660 --> 28:43.411
No.

28:45.538 --> 28:48.541
Better than that,
seven years, no blackouts.

28:48.625 --> 28:51.878
Fuck yeah, bro',
let's do this!

28:51.961 --> 28:53.922
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah! Come and get it.

28:54.005 --> 28:57.300
Be gentle with me! Be gentle!
I'm postcoital. I'm tender.

28:57.383 --> 28:59.636
Did she cradle the balls
and work the shaft?

29:04.432 --> 29:05.850
Nice.

29:08.519 --> 29:10.146
Look at this fucking guy.

29:11.564 --> 29:13.483
Get the fuck out of my bar.

29:13.566 --> 29:15.818
So, which one of you
has the pet worm?

29:15.902 --> 29:18.488
Worms, plural!

29:18.571 --> 29:21.491
Ah. That's so gross.

29:21.574 --> 29:24.660
Talk to him about it.
He's got the fetish.

29:24.744 --> 29:27.330
Watch it.
It's a psych project actually.

29:27.413 --> 29:29.165
It's a study on memory loss.

29:29.248 --> 29:32.460
Better explain before all this excitement
gives me a heart attack.

29:35.213 --> 29:37.089
10 bucks says he
eats it off the floor.

29:38.758 --> 29:40.676
Well, if I can figure out

29:40.760 --> 29:43.054
how the memories
in a simple worm function,

29:43.137 --> 29:45.556
it should help me to understand
the complexities ...

29:47.558 --> 29:49.226
of the human brain.

29:51.103 --> 29:52.772
Let me get this shot.

30:00.071 --> 30:02.448
- What the fuck, weirdo?!
- Fuck this ...

30:09.997 --> 30:13.125
Well, I guess
that's your game.

30:13.209 --> 30:15.628
Go, you go.

30:24.637 --> 30:26.555
It smells like sex in here.

30:26.639 --> 30:30.267
Yeah, Thumper had
a busy afternoon.

30:31.518 --> 30:34.480
You're kidding?
He's so big.

30:34.563 --> 30:36.440
Yeah.

30:36.523 --> 30:40.277
Well, I guess charisma
and eyeliner go a long way.

30:41.987 --> 30:44.281
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

30:46.825 --> 30:50.162
You got any incense or scented candles
or something?

30:50.245 --> 30:51.788
Okay.

30:53.332 --> 30:56.043
Whoa, no.

30:57.127 --> 30:58.962
Let me put this away.

30:59.046 --> 31:01.340
Most guys usually tuck porn
under their bed.

31:01.423 --> 31:03.300
All you've got
are comp books?

31:03.383 --> 31:05.093
Yeah, they're my journals.

31:05.177 --> 31:07.429
I've been keeping them
since I was seven.

31:07.512 --> 31:08.638
Wow.

31:11.183 --> 31:14.186
Read me something.

31:14.269 --> 31:16.646
I ought to be getting
something out of this.

31:16.730 --> 31:18.648
That's all I've got to say.

31:21.067 --> 31:23.028
Here we go.

31:23.111 --> 31:26.323
'It's like my mind refuses
to believe what I'm seeing.'

31:31.745 --> 31:35.582
' ... Hearing Crockett
make those awful screams.

31:41.463 --> 31:44.883
Just writing about it
gives me the shivers.'

31:47.093 --> 31:49.971
Come on. Go on.

31:53.475 --> 31:57.812
'It was like Tommy
was possessed or something.

31:59.063 --> 32:01.399
There was a hate
in his eyes that ... '

32:08.198 --> 32:09.616
Are you okay?

32:16.748 --> 32:17.957
Where am I?

32:19.792 --> 32:22.045
What the hell's going on?

32:32.263 --> 32:34.640
I can't get it open!

32:34.724 --> 32:38.436
Drop it or I'll slit
your mother's throat in her sleep.

32:42.940 --> 32:45.860
Uhh! I got him, Lenny.
Save Crockett!

32:54.327 --> 32:56.370
Listen to me, Evan,
and you listen to me good.

32:56.454 --> 32:58.748
There's a million
other sisters in the world,

32:58.831 --> 33:01.292
so why'd you have
to fuck with mine?

33:05.504 --> 33:07.715
It's okay.
It was just a dream.

33:09.383 --> 33:11.093
Uh-huh ...

33:11.177 --> 33:13.053
it didn't feel like a dream.

33:13.137 --> 33:14.930
Maybe because
they never do.

33:16.390 --> 33:18.976
So, Don Juan, you pass out
on all your dates?

33:54.178 --> 33:56.471
Lenny ...

33:56.555 --> 33:58.473
hey, I've got a surprise for you.

33:58.557 --> 34:00.642
You're never gonna
guess who's here.

34:00.726 --> 34:04.313
Hey, it's me ... Evan.

34:40.056 --> 34:43.101
What are you working on there?
A model?

34:45.270 --> 34:47.688
Look, uh ...

34:47.772 --> 34:49.357
I can see that you're busy,

34:49.440 --> 34:51.775
so I'll try to make this quick.

34:51.860 --> 34:54.654
Remember, uh ...

34:54.737 --> 34:56.656
that day at the junkyard

34:56.739 --> 34:59.033
when we were kids?

34:59.117 --> 35:02.245
I was just hoping that you
could help me remember.

35:04.664 --> 35:08.543
Like, just any details about it or ...

35:10.587 --> 35:13.715
I couldn't cut the rope.

35:13.798 --> 35:16.134
Yeah ...

35:16.217 --> 35:19.012
that's good. Um ...

35:19.095 --> 35:21.889
anything else?

35:26.269 --> 35:29.188
'Drop it or I'll slit
your mother's throat in her sleep! '

35:32.692 --> 35:34.193
Uh ...

35:39.240 --> 35:41.159
Jesus Christ.

35:43.995 --> 35:46.539
It really happened.

35:46.622 --> 35:49.125
Wow, uh ...

35:49.208 --> 35:51.252
Wow, Lenny, l ...

35:53.629 --> 35:55.965
'Make one peep

35:56.048 --> 35:59.969
and I swear it'll be
your last, motherfucker.'

36:34.461 --> 36:36.755
'The last thing I remember
before the blackout

36:36.839 --> 36:39.049
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

36:39.133 --> 36:41.677
I think I was more
focused on her hands

36:41.760 --> 36:45.222
on mine
than on the mailbox ...

36:46.348 --> 36:48.767
across the street.'

37:00.320 --> 37:03.031
Maybe it went out,
should someone check it?

37:03.115 --> 37:05.284
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

37:14.042 --> 37:17.170
You make one peep and I swear
it'll be your last, motherfucker.

37:22.134 --> 37:23.802
Ugh!

37:23.885 --> 37:26.054
Fuck!

37:30.725 --> 37:33.854
What's this?
Huh? What's this?

37:35.939 --> 37:38.400
Want to get the mail?

37:39.484 --> 37:42.487
How's my sweet girl?

37:42.571 --> 37:44.656
How's my sweet girl?

37:44.739 --> 37:46.992
You need a change,
don't you, honey?

37:47.075 --> 37:48.827
You wanna open it?

37:48.910 --> 37:51.162
You wanna open it?

37:53.039 --> 37:55.125
- Oh my God!
- Holy shit!

37:55.208 --> 37:57.335
Run!

37:57.419 --> 37:59.629
Fuck, Lenny, come on!

37:59.713 --> 38:01.840
Lenny, come on!

38:01.923 --> 38:03.883
Come on, Lenny, let's go!

38:09.514 --> 38:12.100
No, baby. That's my finger
in your arse.

38:17.897 --> 38:20.900
Christ, man.

38:20.984 --> 38:23.027
Fuckin' brutal!

38:24.862 --> 38:26.573
What the ... ?

38:30.201 --> 38:32.996
- Hello.
- Hello. Who is this?

38:33.079 --> 38:36.332
Mrs. Kagan, um,
it's Evan ... Treborn.

38:36.416 --> 38:38.918
I hope you know
how much you upset Lenny.

38:39.001 --> 38:42.839
Yeah, I'm ... look,
I'm really sorry about that.

38:42.922 --> 38:45.508
It took me over an hour
to clean up the mess you made.

38:45.591 --> 38:48.052
Can I just talk to Lenny?

38:48.136 --> 38:50.346
Don't call here.

38:57.812 --> 39:00.273
Mum.

39:00.356 --> 39:02.942
I can't help it.
I'm just so proud of you.

39:03.025 --> 39:06.362
Hey, did ... did Dad ...

39:06.445 --> 39:09.031
Did Jason get good grades?

39:09.115 --> 39:11.951
Please, he got straight As
without ever touching a book.

39:12.034 --> 39:14.495
It was the one area
his memory never failed him.

39:14.995 --> 39:17.039
Did he ever say that he, like ...

39:17.123 --> 39:21.252
figured out a way to recall
his lost memories

39:21.335 --> 39:24.421
like years after he blacked them out
in the first place?

39:24.505 --> 39:27.883
- Why do you ask?
- No, I just figured with him being

39:27.967 --> 39:29.552
you know, such a brain and all

39:29.635 --> 39:32.263
it's like, you would think
that he would figure out

39:32.346 --> 39:34.682
a way to remember
stuff that he forgot.

39:34.765 --> 39:36.934
Well, when he was your age ...

39:37.017 --> 39:39.436
almost exactly your age
come to think of it,

39:39.520 --> 39:43.315
he said he figured out
a way to remember his past.

39:43.399 --> 39:45.609
I couldn't tell
if they were real memories

39:45.693 --> 39:47.778
or just his imagination.

39:47.861 --> 39:52.199
Then, just before
it got so bad, he ...

39:53.283 --> 39:55.452
had to be institutionalised,

39:55.536 --> 39:57.830
he said he could ...

39:59.039 --> 40:01.625
What?

40:01.708 --> 40:03.544
What?

40:05.045 --> 40:06.839
What ... what did he do?

40:06.922 --> 40:09.007
Forget it.

40:09.091 --> 40:12.344
It's nothing.
He was far too sick by then.

40:17.557 --> 40:20.477
Come on, Mum, what did he
say that he could do?

40:22.604 --> 40:24.731
What do you say, as a goof?

40:24.815 --> 40:26.233
No, Mum, come on.

40:26.316 --> 40:28.694
Come on, yourself ...
it'll be fun.

40:29.903 --> 40:31.697
Alright, it's your dime.

40:42.207 --> 40:43.834
Give me your hand, young man.

40:43.917 --> 40:46.211
- This is supposed to be your trick.
- Uh-uh.

40:50.090 --> 40:53.051
- Evan!
- What?

40:53.134 --> 40:56.054
Have you ever had
your palm read before?

40:56.137 --> 40:59.516
No, this is the first time,
so be gentle please.

40:59.599 --> 41:01.226
What?

41:01.309 --> 41:03.353
You have no lifeline.

41:04.938 --> 41:06.648
You don't belong here.

41:08.274 --> 41:10.985
For an extra five bucks
she'll spit in your face, Mum.

41:12.112 --> 41:15.615
- No, really, what's his future?
- He has no soul!

41:17.492 --> 41:19.577
You were never meant to be.

41:24.582 --> 41:26.501
Psychic, huh?

41:26.584 --> 41:29.504
This won't come as much
of a shock to you.

41:39.013 --> 41:40.807
Thank you.

41:47.939 --> 41:50.108
When did you start
smoking again?

41:50.191 --> 41:51.901
Lay off, Evan.

41:55.530 --> 41:57.156
Hey?

41:57.240 --> 41:58.699
What ...

42:00.326 --> 42:03.913
You're not gonna let that old hag
ruin the rest of our time together?

42:03.996 --> 42:06.791
She's nuts, she's a lunatic.

42:06.874 --> 42:08.501
That's like an act.

42:08.584 --> 42:10.419
- They just do that ...
- I know.

42:10.503 --> 42:13.381
I'm sorry,
she just hit a nerve.

42:16.926 --> 42:20.388
Well ... why?

42:20.471 --> 42:22.932
I don't get it.

42:23.015 --> 42:25.768
Before you were born,
I was pregnant twice,

42:25.851 --> 42:28.354
and they were both stillbirths.

42:35.402 --> 42:37.613
Why didn't you ever tell me that?

42:40.741 --> 42:43.494
It's not something
I like to remember.

42:44.578 --> 42:47.623
And then when I was
pregnant with you,

42:47.706 --> 42:51.835
I was terrified.
I had to expect the worst.

42:55.631 --> 42:59.218
- And?
- And you came out fine.

43:01.053 --> 43:04.598
And ever since then, I've considered you
my little miracle baby.

43:13.273 --> 43:14.983
Don't cry.

43:15.067 --> 43:17.069
Come on, let's go.
It's late.

43:28.372 --> 43:30.707
'I never wanted to be
in the movie, anyway.

43:32.084 --> 43:35.128
I was cold, so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

43:35.212 --> 43:37.214
Mr. Miller took my shirt off.'

43:37.297 --> 43:39.216
What the fuck are you doing?

43:39.299 --> 43:41.885
Shhh, I need quiet for this.

43:41.968 --> 43:44.513
Are you stupid or what, man?

43:44.596 --> 43:47.307
Maybe there's a reason
you repressed the day

43:47.390 --> 43:49.851
some pervert had you
in your tighty whities.

43:52.979 --> 43:54.940
I'd think twice
about what you're doing.

43:55.023 --> 43:57.484
You could wake up a lot more
fucked up than you are now.

43:57.567 --> 44:00.070
- More fucked up than I already am?
- No, l ...

44:00.153 --> 44:02.197
You think you know me?
I don't know me!

44:40.360 --> 44:42.528
Whoa!

44:42.612 --> 44:44.405
I'm sorry.

44:44.489 --> 44:46.574
No, it's my fault.

44:46.658 --> 44:48.868
Can we get through
one damn day

44:48.951 --> 44:50.620
without you
breaking something?

45:18.022 --> 45:20.358
Hey.

45:23.152 --> 45:24.737
Evan.

45:26.405 --> 45:29.617
Oh my God.
It's been a long time.

45:31.535 --> 45:33.454
How you been?

45:33.537 --> 45:36.123
Same old, same old,
you know?

45:36.207 --> 45:39.001
No, I don't know.
Fill me in.

45:39.084 --> 45:41.962
Uhh, well ...

45:42.046 --> 45:44.465
I'm going to State now.

45:44.548 --> 45:46.884
It's going good.
My Mum's good.

45:48.010 --> 45:50.221
- I don't know.
- You want a smoke?

45:50.304 --> 45:52.640
- No, not since we were kids.
- No?

45:52.723 --> 45:54.475
I've quit like 100 times.

45:58.520 --> 46:01.774
- Are you walking home?
- Uh-huh.

46:01.857 --> 46:04.151
- Can I walk you?
- Sure.

46:06.779 --> 46:09.198
- Oh my God.
- So ...

46:11.909 --> 46:14.119
how's Tommy?

46:16.663 --> 46:19.249
Well, they kept him
in juvie for a few years,

46:19.333 --> 46:23.253
but now he's working
over at Dale's Auto Body.

46:23.337 --> 46:25.380
That's good.

46:26.798 --> 46:28.884
Still living with your dad?

46:28.967 --> 46:31.094
No.

46:31.178 --> 46:33.889
I emancipated myself at 15.

46:36.016 --> 46:37.934
Must've taken a lot of courage.

46:38.018 --> 46:40.479
Not if you remember my dad.

46:44.024 --> 46:46.693
Well, couldn't you have just
moved in with your mum?

46:47.778 --> 46:49.654
No, she had a new family.

46:49.738 --> 46:51.698
Wasn't enough room.

46:51.782 --> 46:53.450
Whatever.

46:53.533 --> 46:56.286
Well look, the reason
I came back to town

46:56.369 --> 46:57.996
was to talk to you.

46:58.079 --> 47:00.248
To me? Why?

47:01.958 --> 47:04.461
Well ...

47:04.544 --> 47:06.838
remember when we were kids

47:06.922 --> 47:09.591
and I used to have
those blackouts?

47:09.674 --> 47:11.509
Yeah, of course.

47:11.593 --> 47:15.472
Well, some of those memories
have been coming back to me.

47:15.555 --> 47:18.183
And I just ...
I wanted to talk to you

47:18.266 --> 47:20.393
about one of them in particular.

47:20.477 --> 47:22.729
Well, I'll try to remember.

47:26.816 --> 47:29.194
When we were kids, uh ...

47:29.277 --> 47:31.446
your dad was making a movie

47:31.529 --> 47:34.574
about Robin Hood ... something.

47:34.657 --> 47:36.993
What do you want
to know, Evan?!

47:40.997 --> 47:43.333
Is ... did he ...

47:44.417 --> 47:47.420
What happened
in the basement?

47:47.503 --> 47:49.464
Look, it was a long time ago.

47:51.341 --> 47:53.259
I know.

47:53.343 --> 47:55.762
Is that why you came
all the way back here?

47:55.845 --> 47:58.681
To ask a lot of stupid questions
about Robin Hood?

47:58.765 --> 48:01.267
No, l ...

48:01.350 --> 48:04.687
I just think that something really bad
might have happened.

48:04.771 --> 48:07.148
Is there a point
to any of this?

48:09.233 --> 48:11.903
Look, whatever happened
it wasn't our fault.

48:11.986 --> 48:15.072
We were kids. I mean, there was nothing
that we could do to deserve ...

48:15.156 --> 48:17.366
Just shut up, Evan!

48:17.450 --> 48:19.493
You're wasting your breath.

48:19.577 --> 48:22.455
You can't hate yourself 'cause
your dad's a twisted freak.

48:22.538 --> 48:26.208
Who are you trying
to convince, Evan?

48:26.292 --> 48:28.544
You come all the way back here
to stir up my shit

48:28.627 --> 48:30.880
just because you have
a bad memory?

48:30.963 --> 48:33.466
What, do you want me to just cry
on your shoulder

48:33.549 --> 48:35.843
and tell you everything's
all better now?

48:35.926 --> 48:38.095
Well, fuck you, Evan!

48:38.179 --> 48:40.639
Nothing's all better, okay?

48:40.723 --> 48:42.725
Nothing ever gets better.

48:46.270 --> 48:49.064
You know, if I was
so wonderful, Evan,

48:49.148 --> 48:51.025
why didn't you call me?

48:51.108 --> 48:53.569
Why did you just
leave me here to rot?

49:09.710 --> 49:13.172
When he was your age ... almost exactly
your age, come to think of it ...

49:13.255 --> 49:16.425
he said he figured out a way
to remember his past.

49:19.970 --> 49:22.222
Some dude left
a message for you.

49:22.306 --> 49:24.725
You can smell that all the way
to the bathroom.

49:27.394 --> 49:29.938
Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter.

49:30.022 --> 49:33.066
I just wondered why you didn't
hand in your essay this afternoon.

49:33.150 --> 49:35.902
I was a bit concerned.
Call me to schedule a make-up.

49:38.530 --> 49:41.908
What'd you say
to my sister, motherfucker?

49:41.992 --> 49:45.078
Last night she cried on the phone
for over an hour to me.

49:45.162 --> 49:48.206
She said you came
and saw her last night.

49:48.290 --> 49:50.000
She ...

49:50.083 --> 49:53.003
she fucking
killed herself tonight.

49:53.086 --> 49:55.088
She's dead ...

49:55.172 --> 49:58.008
and so are you!

51:16.002 --> 51:18.004
'If the scar on my stomach

51:18.087 --> 51:20.172
didn't just come out of nowhere,

51:20.256 --> 51:22.884
maybe my father wasn't
as crazy as everyone thought.

51:25.219 --> 51:28.347
If I can make scars, do I have
the power to heal them?

51:30.474 --> 51:32.852
What about Kayleigh's scars? '

51:38.357 --> 51:41.527
'I never wanted
to be in the movie, anyway.

51:41.610 --> 51:46.407
It was cold, so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

51:48.784 --> 51:52.580
But Mr. Miller took my shirt off.'

52:04.258 --> 52:06.468
I've got an idea.
Let's go down to the basement.

52:06.552 --> 52:09.054
It'll look more like
a dungeon down there.

52:10.889 --> 52:13.892
A little light here.

52:13.976 --> 52:16.145
Huh?

52:17.688 --> 52:20.691
Hey, now what did I tell you
about keeping that door shut?

52:20.774 --> 52:22.359
But I wanna see.

52:22.443 --> 52:25.028
You're going to see the back of my fist
in about two seconds

52:25.112 --> 52:26.989
if you don't do what I tell you.

52:29.032 --> 52:31.660
Now, in this part of the story,

52:31.743 --> 52:35.122
Robin Hood has just
married Maid Marian

52:35.205 --> 52:38.375
and they have to kiss and stuff,

52:38.458 --> 52:40.502
like the grown-ups do.

52:40.586 --> 52:43.005
So, take off
your clothes, Kayleigh.

52:46.508 --> 52:49.052
Come on, just like
when we take a bath.

52:49.136 --> 52:51.555
Don't make a big deal out of it.
You too, Evan.

52:53.181 --> 52:56.935
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
We're making a movie here.

52:57.018 --> 52:59.479
Put your hands on your ears.

53:01.857 --> 53:04.359
What time is it?

53:04.442 --> 53:08.780
It's time for you to do
what I tell you to do.

53:08.864 --> 53:10.907
Wrong answer, fuckbag!

53:10.991 --> 53:13.743
This is the very moment
of your reckoning.

53:13.827 --> 53:16.997
In the next 30 seconds, you're going
to open up one of two doors.

53:17.080 --> 53:20.709
The first door will forever
traumatise your own flesh and blood.

53:20.792 --> 53:23.503
What ... what's happening?

53:23.586 --> 53:25.797
How are you doing this?

53:25.880 --> 53:28.049
It'll change your daughter

53:28.133 --> 53:30.009
from a beautiful child

53:30.093 --> 53:32.345
into an empty shell

53:32.429 --> 53:34.305
whose only concept of trust

53:34.389 --> 53:37.809
was betrayed by her own
sick paedophile father!

53:37.892 --> 53:39.769
Ultimately ...

53:39.853 --> 53:41.604
it'll lead to her suicide.

53:41.688 --> 53:44.274
- Nice work, Daddy.
- Who are you?

53:44.357 --> 53:47.944
Let's just say you're being
closely watched, George!

53:48.027 --> 53:51.072
Your other option is
to treat Kayleigh like ...

53:51.155 --> 53:53.533
say like a loving father
treats his daughter.

53:54.867 --> 53:56.869
Sound okay to you, Papa?

53:58.121 --> 53:59.205
Yes.

53:59.289 --> 54:02.000
Listen close then, fuckbag.

54:02.083 --> 54:03.876
You screw this up again,

54:03.960 --> 54:06.713
I'll flat out castrate you.

54:08.339 --> 54:11.592
What you need to do
is discipline your son Tommy,

54:11.676 --> 54:14.387
because the kid
is one sadistic pup.

54:15.471 --> 54:17.014
One last thing.

54:24.188 --> 54:26.148
Don't ever touch me again!

54:28.025 --> 54:29.652
L ... I won't.

54:49.797 --> 54:51.257
Ahhh!

54:51.340 --> 54:53.217
Faster, faster!

54:55.928 --> 54:57.596
Crockett!

54:58.722 --> 55:00.349
Kayleigh, I can't believe
you came!

55:01.684 --> 55:03.352
I think you got one.

55:03.435 --> 55:05.229
Check out our new house.

55:07.398 --> 55:09.566
- Forever.
- Hell or high water.

55:14.488 --> 55:16.198
Honey, are you alright?

55:19.118 --> 55:21.328
Oh my god, Evan,
you're bleeding.

55:21.412 --> 55:23.997
Kayleigh, you're still ... You ...

55:27.709 --> 55:29.503
Incredible.

55:29.586 --> 55:33.215
Well, thanks. Go get cleaned up
and come back to bed.

55:34.675 --> 55:38.053
Ohh. Where are my clothes?

55:38.136 --> 55:40.305
Those are your clothes, silly.

55:47.187 --> 55:48.605
The bathroom is ...

55:54.361 --> 55:57.322
Hurry up. I want a quickie
before school.

56:35.485 --> 56:37.487
What?

56:39.155 --> 56:40.824
Unfucking believable.

56:41.908 --> 56:43.326
Alright.

56:43.409 --> 56:45.745
I wish I could get as excited
over a nosebleed.

56:47.038 --> 56:50.375
Sorry, uh, I didn't
see you there.

56:53.044 --> 56:54.712
What?

56:54.796 --> 56:57.840
You're the girl that
was with those arseholes

56:57.924 --> 57:00.009
throwing popcorn at Thumper.

57:00.093 --> 57:02.095
What?

57:02.178 --> 57:04.973
And your name is Gwen.

57:05.056 --> 57:06.557
I know you.

57:08.434 --> 57:11.062
Seriously, Evan,
lay off the blow.

57:15.274 --> 57:17.110
- Hi.
- Hi.

57:22.490 --> 57:24.742
Hey, um ...

57:24.826 --> 57:27.537
don't freak out
when I ask you this, but ...

57:29.205 --> 57:32.333
do you remember when your dad
got that video camera?

57:32.416 --> 57:33.793
What's up, man?

57:33.876 --> 57:36.420
Yeah, um ...

57:36.504 --> 57:39.090
I think he had it like
the first day

57:39.173 --> 57:41.217
and then he gave it away
or something.

57:41.300 --> 57:43.302
Why would that freak me out?

57:44.637 --> 57:46.222
I don't know.

57:46.305 --> 57:48.474
Just being weird.

57:48.557 --> 57:50.726
You are such a goofus.

57:53.312 --> 57:55.481
So I'll see you tonight.

57:55.564 --> 57:57.358
Okay.

58:19.046 --> 58:20.506
- Andrea ...
- Evan ...

58:20.589 --> 58:22.925
- and Chuck ...
- aren't home right now.

58:23.008 --> 58:24.927
You know what to do.

58:25.010 --> 58:26.804
Uh, hey, Mum.

58:26.887 --> 58:30.015
It's me. And hey, Chuck.

58:30.099 --> 58:33.185
Ah, I'm just calling
to say hi, I guess.

58:33.268 --> 58:35.145
Give me a call back.

58:38.732 --> 58:41.819
Hey, Thumper, do you know
what time it is, man?

58:41.902 --> 58:44.279
What's the matter,
you lost your Rolex?

58:45.364 --> 58:47.241
Fuck you, frat boy!

58:50.535 --> 58:52.955
Remember, everyone,
there's only two more weeks

58:53.038 --> 58:55.457
until your psych projects
are due.

58:55.540 --> 58:58.543
Uh, about that essay
I missed last week,

58:58.627 --> 59:01.004
we're still okay
with the extension, right?

59:01.088 --> 59:02.923
And you are?

59:03.006 --> 59:05.509
Evan ... Treborn.

59:05.592 --> 59:07.469
Well, the answer's no, Mr. Treborn.

59:07.552 --> 59:10.180
Now please take your seat.
The exam is about to begin.

59:15.727 --> 59:17.896
Alright, settle down, everyone.

59:17.979 --> 59:20.607
The exam will begin
in one minute.

59:24.986 --> 59:26.738
Get off me, arsehole.

59:26.821 --> 59:29.199
You guys started that shit.

59:29.282 --> 59:31.868
Evan, you're hysterical.

59:34.079 --> 59:35.789
Did you study for this?

59:37.707 --> 59:39.501
Oh, uh ...

59:39.584 --> 59:41.628
we'll find out.

59:41.711 --> 59:43.630
Me neither.

59:55.225 --> 59:57.018
Holy shit!
Are these the answers?

59:57.101 --> 59:58.770
Damn, Evan,
keep it on the dl.

01:00:05.526 --> 01:00:07.445
Hey, uh ...

01:00:07.528 --> 01:00:11.157
I want to do something special
for Kayleigh tomorrow night.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.702
Uh, so if I said that I needed

01:00:14.786 --> 01:00:17.121
some help from you
and the brothers ...

01:00:17.205 --> 01:00:19.707
I'd say, 'blow me.'

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:24.045
Get the pledges to do it.

01:00:24.128 --> 01:00:26.798
- Right, the pledges.
- Yeah.

01:00:26.881 --> 01:00:29.509
You may begin now.

01:00:46.359 --> 01:00:49.070
Oh, that was so good.

01:00:50.321 --> 01:00:52.281
Oh my God.

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:55.659
Where'd you learn
those new tricks?

01:00:57.119 --> 01:00:58.996
Why?

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.166
It ... it wasn't weird, was it?

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:06.587
Yeah, if you call
multiple orgasms weird.

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:17.431
Hello?

01:01:19.516 --> 01:01:21.602
- Fuck 'em.
- Hello?

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:28.609
Oh.

01:01:32.988 --> 01:01:35.908
What do you think
it is about us

01:01:35.991 --> 01:01:40.120
that makes us so perfect?

01:01:41.872 --> 01:01:44.875
I mean ...

01:01:44.958 --> 01:01:47.419
why did you sneak out

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:50.380
to visit me
after I moved away?

01:01:50.464 --> 01:01:52.299
'Cause I missed you.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.554
What, do you think my dad could have
stopped me from seeing you?

01:01:58.764 --> 01:02:00.223
What's he gonna do?

01:02:03.018 --> 01:02:05.228
Oh, my gosh.
My toes are numb.

01:02:06.688 --> 01:02:09.316
Do you think that we'll
be together forever?

01:02:14.279 --> 01:02:16.239
That is the plan, isn't it?

01:02:18.033 --> 01:02:20.118
'Hell or high water'?

01:02:20.202 --> 01:02:22.037
Yeah.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.164
Yeah, that's ...

01:02:24.247 --> 01:02:25.999
I was just making sure.

01:02:28.627 --> 01:02:31.504
Yeah, that's the plan!

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.290
Alright, uh ...

01:02:45.373 --> 01:02:49.377
all you rushes, you know
what you have to do for me.

01:02:49.461 --> 01:02:51.296
Pledges, uh ...

01:02:51.379 --> 01:02:53.215
we're pledges, sir.

01:02:53.298 --> 01:02:56.259
Uh, brother Evan, sir.

01:02:58.261 --> 01:02:59.804
Are you kidding me?

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.685
What?
What did you say to me?

01:03:05.769 --> 01:03:08.355
You know what, give me the Greek
alphabet. Give it to me!

01:03:08.438 --> 01:03:09.898
- Uhh-uhh.
- Uhh-uhh.

01:03:09.981 --> 01:03:11.733
- Alpha, beta ...
- Alpha, beta, gamma, delta ...

01:03:11.816 --> 01:03:14.069
epsilon, zeta, eta, theta,
iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi,

01:03:14.152 --> 01:03:16.905
omicron, pi, rho, sigma, tau,
upsilon, phi, chi, psi, omega, Sir.

01:03:16.988 --> 01:03:19.949
Maybe that's what it is.
Don't fucking look at me, look down.

01:03:24.746 --> 01:03:26.164
Uh ...

01:03:27.957 --> 01:03:30.084
alright, um ...

01:03:31.669 --> 01:03:34.422
so, you ... you pledges

01:03:34.506 --> 01:03:37.425
you guys know what
you need to do for me.

01:03:37.508 --> 01:03:39.302
And you guys take a shower

01:03:39.385 --> 01:03:41.554
and if anyone
gives you any trouble,

01:03:41.638 --> 01:03:43.306
you tell 'em I said it was okay.

01:03:46.809 --> 01:03:48.728
What?

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.650
Shower that, bitch.

01:03:58.905 --> 01:04:01.574
I don't understand.
Where are you taking me?

01:04:01.657 --> 01:04:03.910
I'm not telling.

01:04:13.252 --> 01:04:15.671
Oh my God!

01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:23.971
Wow, it's beautiful.

01:04:24.055 --> 01:04:26.891
Go on, sit down.

01:04:28.059 --> 01:04:29.727
Thank you.

01:04:40.696 --> 01:04:42.156
Why are you doing this for me?

01:04:43.741 --> 01:04:45.409
When I woke up this morning ...

01:04:47.203 --> 01:04:49.205
I saw your smile.

01:04:50.289 --> 01:04:52.041
That smile.

01:04:53.292 --> 01:04:54.835
And I knew

01:04:54.919 --> 01:04:58.005
that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life

01:04:58.088 --> 01:04:59.923
with you.

01:05:13.103 --> 01:05:15.397
I've been looking
all over for you, man.

01:05:15.481 --> 01:05:16.899
Someone trashed your car.

01:05:24.239 --> 01:05:26.241
What the ...

01:05:27.492 --> 01:05:29.369
Who did this?!

01:05:29.453 --> 01:05:31.538
Who did it?!

01:05:31.622 --> 01:05:33.916
It was probably
those Beta fuckers.

01:05:33.999 --> 01:05:36.043
No, no, no.

01:05:36.126 --> 01:05:38.378
How did somebody
get away with this

01:05:38.462 --> 01:05:40.464
right in front
of the frat house?

01:05:42.215 --> 01:05:46.178
- Dude, what is that, a dog collar?
- Tommy.

01:05:48.513 --> 01:05:50.557
Don't.

01:05:51.641 --> 01:05:53.393
He might be watching.

01:05:54.478 --> 01:05:56.062
It's my fault.

01:05:56.146 --> 01:05:58.732
I should have told you
he was released a few weeks ago.

01:05:58.815 --> 01:06:00.567
Yeah, it might have been nice.

01:06:04.821 --> 01:06:06.114
God.

01:06:11.703 --> 01:06:14.039
Like this is gonna
do any good.

01:06:14.122 --> 01:06:16.374
Maybe one of the frat guys
has got a gun.

01:06:16.458 --> 01:06:18.460
Evan, don't even joke!

01:06:18.543 --> 01:06:20.253
He's not going
to hurt you, okay?

01:06:20.337 --> 01:06:22.380
He's just trying to scare you
away from me.

01:06:22.464 --> 01:06:24.841
He killed my dog.

01:06:24.924 --> 01:06:27.886
- You don't remember that?
- Evan, it's not his fault.

01:06:27.969 --> 01:06:30.513
You know how bad he had it
when we were kids.

01:06:30.597 --> 01:06:34.309
Oh no, don't give me
this bad upbringing shit.

01:06:34.392 --> 01:06:36.019
You turned out just fine.

01:06:36.102 --> 01:06:38.354
My father never
laid a hand on me.

01:06:38.438 --> 01:06:41.858
It's like that prick
saved it all up for Tommy.

01:06:46.738 --> 01:06:50.783
Okay. Alright. Uh ...

01:06:52.869 --> 01:06:56.664
We'll let campus security
deal with it. Okay?

01:06:58.124 --> 01:07:00.543
You know what?
I think I should sleep alone.

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.173
No, you're not staying alone.
I'm staying with you.

01:07:05.256 --> 01:07:07.467
Evan, I just ... I don't want Tommy

01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:09.135
to see us together right now.

01:07:09.218 --> 01:07:12.513
No, I lost you once
and I'm not losing you again.

01:07:12.597 --> 01:07:14.265
What do you mean
you lost me once?

01:07:14.348 --> 01:07:17.226
Evan, you've never lost me.
What are you talking about?

01:07:17.310 --> 01:07:20.354
God, you've been
acting so weird lately.

01:07:20.438 --> 01:07:24.108
Look, my car just got wrecked, okay?
I'm kind of freaking out.

01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:26.819
I know that, but ...

01:07:26.902 --> 01:07:28.529
your accent's changed.

01:07:28.613 --> 01:07:31.782
- You don't even walk the same.
- What, I walk differently?

01:07:31.866 --> 01:07:33.909
I mean, that dinner tonight,

01:07:33.993 --> 01:07:35.870
it was so beautiful.
It was gorgeous.

01:07:35.953 --> 01:07:37.955
But it just wasn't you.

01:07:38.039 --> 01:07:40.666
I can't do
something nice for you?

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:44.086
Wait ...

01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:46.088
isn't that your jacket?

01:07:56.098 --> 01:07:57.766
Tommy!

01:07:58.851 --> 01:08:01.020
You stay away from us,
you sick fuck.

01:08:01.103 --> 01:08:03.397
Oh, get this 'us' shit.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.941
Like I'd ever lay a hand
on my own sister.

01:08:06.025 --> 01:08:08.485
You're doing real nice
for yourself, Evan.

01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:10.612
You've got a nice life,

01:08:10.696 --> 01:08:12.489
you got nice friends,

01:08:12.573 --> 01:08:14.783
not to mention
you're fucking my sister.

01:08:14.867 --> 01:08:17.453
Not a bad piece of arse
if I say so myself.

01:08:17.536 --> 01:08:20.456
- Shut up, Tommy!
- Oh, come on. That's a compliment.

01:08:20.538 --> 01:08:22.416
What are you doing, man?
What the fuck?

01:08:22.499 --> 01:08:25.419
Oh, it's not good enough that
the whole fucking world loves you?

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:27.671
But you've got to take
the only thing on this Earth

01:08:27.754 --> 01:08:29.715
that doesn't think
that I'm a piece of shit?

01:08:29.798 --> 01:08:31.258
You know I love you.

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:33.594
No one thinks that
you're a piece of shit, Tom.

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:36.930
What was it you said?
I think I believe it was, 'sick fuck'!

01:08:37.014 --> 01:08:38.974
Don't! Tommy!

01:08:41.768 --> 01:08:43.145
Stop!

01:08:43.228 --> 01:08:44.813
Stop!

01:08:45.897 --> 01:08:48.734
Stop! Oh my God!

01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:52.571
Stop!

01:08:52.654 --> 01:08:54.613
Oh my God!

01:08:54.698 --> 01:08:56.408
Oh!

01:08:57.993 --> 01:08:59.828
No, Evan!

01:08:59.911 --> 01:09:01.121
Stop!

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:02.288
Stop it!

01:09:02.372 --> 01:09:05.542
- You're gonna kill him!
- He's a fuckin' maniac!

01:09:06.751 --> 01:09:08.670
Don't do this,
I'm begging you!

01:09:08.752 --> 01:09:10.505
You ruined Lenny's life!

01:09:12.215 --> 01:09:13.633
You killed Crockett!

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:15.635
You killed
that woman and her baby!

01:09:16.928 --> 01:09:19.221
Now you're trying to kill me.

01:09:19.305 --> 01:09:22.017
Just tryin' to fucking kill me!

01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:36.613
Oh my God!

01:09:36.698 --> 01:09:39.200
Oh my God,
what did you do?

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.745
Oh my God!

01:10:13.651 --> 01:10:15.361
You right there, faggot!

01:10:43.222 --> 01:10:45.599
First time?

01:10:45.683 --> 01:10:47.268
Yeah.

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:50.813
You'd better not
bitch up, man.

01:10:50.896 --> 01:10:53.399
You'll wind up someone's
luggage that way.

01:10:59.363 --> 01:11:01.031
Can you protect me?

01:11:01.115 --> 01:11:02.825
Jesus himself

01:11:02.908 --> 01:11:05.452
couldn't make me stand up
against the brotherhood.

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:18.882
Look, man ...

01:11:19.967 --> 01:11:22.386
when they come,

01:11:22.469 --> 01:11:25.556
you go someplace else
in your head, man.

01:11:25.639 --> 01:11:27.975
Be somewhere else.

01:11:45.158 --> 01:11:47.119
Back your arse up.

01:11:59.047 --> 01:12:01.466
Yo, gimme that.

01:12:17.899 --> 01:12:21.069
I spoke to your lawyer.

01:12:21.152 --> 01:12:23.488
And he says he's sure

01:12:23.571 --> 01:12:25.532
he can get you off
on self-defence.

01:12:25.615 --> 01:12:27.659
So if you're just patient ...

01:12:27.742 --> 01:12:30.620
Mum ...

01:12:30.704 --> 01:12:32.455
How long am I gonna
be in here?

01:12:32.539 --> 01:12:34.708
I don't know.

01:12:34.791 --> 01:12:37.794
These things take time.

01:12:37.877 --> 01:12:39.587
What about the journals?

01:12:39.671 --> 01:12:41.714
Did you bring the ones
I asked you to bring?

01:12:41.798 --> 01:12:44.968
I found these two.

01:12:45.051 --> 01:12:47.011
The others are still in storage.

01:12:48.096 --> 01:12:51.307
Mum! L ...

01:12:55.228 --> 01:12:56.563
I need them all,

01:12:56.646 --> 01:12:58.314
all of them.

01:12:58.398 --> 01:13:00.400
And I'm going
to get them to you,

01:13:00.483 --> 01:13:04.696
but right now, you need
to concentrate on the case.

01:13:07.865 --> 01:13:09.659
Please.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.080
Alright.

01:13:14.163 --> 01:13:16.082
You're right.

01:13:20.169 --> 01:13:22.588
What about Kayleigh?

01:13:22.672 --> 01:13:24.715
Is she alright?

01:13:29.136 --> 01:13:31.097
Try to tell her I'm sorry.

01:13:33.849 --> 01:13:36.018
Time's up.

01:13:36.102 --> 01:13:37.770
I'm not going
to lose you, kiddo.

01:13:37.853 --> 01:13:39.814
Promise me you'll hang on.

01:13:55.079 --> 01:13:57.832
Shit on my dick
or blood on my knife.

01:14:06.632 --> 01:14:08.259
They're mine ...

01:14:22.147 --> 01:14:23.941
Come on!

01:14:25.818 --> 01:14:29.071
Back the fuck off!

01:14:29.154 --> 01:14:30.656
Show's over, ladies!

01:14:33.826 --> 01:14:35.410
Put this maggot
back in his cell.

01:14:35.494 --> 01:14:38.330
Move it!
Come on, let's go!

01:14:54.096 --> 01:14:56.807
We'll be seeing you
later on tonight, little sister.

01:15:48.233 --> 01:15:50.610
'Today, I found

01:15:50.693 --> 01:15:52.862
my grandfather's
death certificate.

01:15:52.946 --> 01:15:56.115
He died in a nut house
just like my father.

01:15:56.199 --> 01:16:00.828
Mum denies it, but she thinks
I'm going to end up the same way.'

01:16:00.912 --> 01:16:03.873
Boo-hoo-hoo.

01:16:15.468 --> 01:16:17.595
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:16:18.721 --> 01:16:20.181
Come on, Reese.

01:16:26.604 --> 01:16:28.189
You're religious, Carlos,

01:16:28.272 --> 01:16:30.149
you believe in that whole bit,

01:16:30.233 --> 01:16:32.735
the Lord works
in mysterious ways?

01:16:32.819 --> 01:16:35.112
Straight up, man.

01:16:35.196 --> 01:16:38.866
'Cause I think Jesus sent me
to your cell for a reason.

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:41.452
For you to help me.

01:16:43.204 --> 01:16:45.539
Shit.

01:16:45.623 --> 01:16:47.458
I knew you were crazy, man.

01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:48.918
I ain't bullshitting you.

01:16:49.001 --> 01:16:50.961
Jesus speaks to me
in my dreams.

01:16:51.045 --> 01:16:53.297
Oh, yeah?

01:16:53.381 --> 01:16:56.133
That's cool. Great.

01:16:56.217 --> 01:16:59.345
A pack of smokes says
I can prove it to you.

01:17:03.557 --> 01:17:06.936
When I'm out, I need you to watch
my hands and face closely.

01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:10.940
You need to see
the prison shrink, man.

01:17:11.023 --> 01:17:13.609
Just tell me if you see
anything just ... weird.

01:17:14.902 --> 01:17:16.737
Weirder than this?

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:18.614
It could be marks.
It could be scars.

01:17:18.697 --> 01:17:21.408
It could be anything,
I don't know.

01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:25.996
'On Wednesday, I got in trouble
for a drawing I didn't do.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.248
Mummy won't let me see it.

01:17:42.971 --> 01:17:46.725
Hey, no monkey business, Evan.
Sit down and finish your drawing.

01:17:50.854 --> 01:17:52.189
That's great, everyone.

01:17:52.272 --> 01:17:54.274
Just imagine
what you want to be.

01:17:54.358 --> 01:17:56.109
There's no limits.

01:18:05.869 --> 01:18:08.330
Oh, Mrs. Boswell.

01:18:11.666 --> 01:18:13.960
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle!

01:18:14.044 --> 01:18:16.379
Look, it's stigmata, man!

01:18:16.463 --> 01:18:18.423
What'd you see?
What'd it look like?

01:18:18.507 --> 01:18:21.927
The signs of the Lord, man.
They just come out of nowhere.

01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:24.012
Man, I thought you were ...

01:18:24.095 --> 01:18:26.306
I though you were
fucking crazy, man.

01:18:27.682 --> 01:18:29.601
So now you believe me.

01:18:31.061 --> 01:18:32.729
Straight up, man.

01:18:44.783 --> 01:18:46.659
Wanna make a deal?

01:18:49.412 --> 01:18:51.915
Alright, look. I'm new here,

01:18:51.998 --> 01:18:53.833
but I think I get
how things work.

01:18:55.585 --> 01:18:57.712
You either join a gang
or you're dead.

01:19:00.048 --> 01:19:02.967
Well, I sure as fuck ain't joining up with no
spics or niggers.

01:19:04.928 --> 01:19:07.263
And I don't want to die.

01:19:07.347 --> 01:19:09.557
So ...

01:19:12.185 --> 01:19:13.811
what do I gotta do?

01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:18.608
I'm the new guy.
I've got to work my way up, so ...

01:19:19.942 --> 01:19:21.986
should I ...

01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:23.905
suck your dick now ...

01:19:25.239 --> 01:19:27.200
or ...

01:19:30.828 --> 01:19:33.873
Is your blood pure?

01:19:33.956 --> 01:19:36.334
Well, I ain't no fucking kike,

01:19:36.417 --> 01:19:37.877
if that's what you're asking me.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:40.796
Well then, let's see
what you got, honey.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.883
Watch the fucking teeth
or you'll be leaving without 'em.

01:19:43.966 --> 01:19:45.426
Yes, Sir.

01:19:54.393 --> 01:19:56.228
Come to daddy.

01:20:01.275 --> 01:20:02.401
Carlos!

01:20:08.491 --> 01:20:10.451
'We took the woods
behind the junkyard

01:20:10.534 --> 01:20:12.661
just to make sure we wouldn't
bump into Tommy!

01:20:12.745 --> 01:20:15.372
We hadn't seen
the smoke yet.'

01:20:15.456 --> 01:20:17.291
Hold 'em. Hold 'em.

01:20:17.374 --> 01:20:19.210
'We took the woods
behind the junkyard

01:20:19.293 --> 01:20:21.420
just to make sure we wouldn't
bump into Tommy.

01:20:21.503 --> 01:20:23.297
We hadn't seen
the smoke yet.'

01:20:27.134 --> 01:20:29.470
Rot in hell,
you fucking animals!

01:20:31.138 --> 01:20:33.724
Wait, before we ...

01:20:33.807 --> 01:20:36.268
we need something
that could open the sack.

01:20:47.154 --> 01:20:48.989
I want you to take this, Lenny.

01:20:49.072 --> 01:20:51.116
Today's your day of atonement.

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.911
I know how guilty you feel
about that woman and her baby.

01:20:53.994 --> 01:20:56.205
Evan, stop it.
It's not the time.

01:20:56.288 --> 01:20:59.458
Now's the only time! Today you get
a chance to redeem yourself,

01:20:59.541 --> 01:21:01.501
to start all over with a clean slate.

01:21:01.585 --> 01:21:04.338
- What are you talking about?
- Evan, you're acting crazy.

01:21:04.421 --> 01:21:07.758
Please, if you've ever trusted me before,
trust me on this one.

01:21:11.595 --> 01:21:13.263
Cut the rope.

01:21:16.892 --> 01:21:18.435
Come on.

01:21:20.395 --> 01:21:23.315
- Listen to me good, Evan.
- I'll do whatever you want.

01:21:23.398 --> 01:21:25.942
You don't want me to see
Kayleigh ever again, fine.

01:21:26.026 --> 01:21:27.736
Just let Crockett go.

01:21:27.819 --> 01:21:29.696
Besides, if you kill him now,

01:21:29.779 --> 01:21:31.698
they'll stick you
in juvie for sure.

01:21:31.781 --> 01:21:34.743
And I know you'd never leave
your sister alone with your father.

01:21:45.670 --> 01:21:47.088
Lenny, no!

01:21:50.508 --> 01:21:51.885
Oh God.

01:21:54.429 --> 01:21:56.347
Oh God, Lenny.

01:21:56.431 --> 01:21:58.349
I said cut the rope.

01:22:21.789 --> 01:22:24.208
It's all backwards.

01:22:31.424 --> 01:22:35.928
Ah! Ah! Ah!

01:22:36.012 --> 01:22:37.430
Evan ...

01:22:40.975 --> 01:22:43.186
What the fuck?

01:22:47.607 --> 01:22:49.150
Lenny, no!

01:22:51.319 --> 01:22:52.904
Want a ride?

01:22:54.155 --> 01:22:55.906
Lenny!

01:22:59.827 --> 01:23:02.455
Somebody call 911!

01:23:02.538 --> 01:23:05.333
Evan! Evan!
Fuck! Evan!

01:23:12.339 --> 01:23:14.008
Hey, doc.

01:23:14.091 --> 01:23:16.177
What's the damage?

01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:18.762
- How much time do I got?
- Cute, Evan.

01:23:18.846 --> 01:23:22.933
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen
results like these before.

01:23:23.017 --> 01:23:25.936
Not even with my father?

01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:29.815
Well, actually, they didn't
have these tests 20 years ago.

01:23:29.899 --> 01:23:31.650
So, what did you find?

01:23:31.734 --> 01:23:34.612
We're finding most of
the haemorrhaging is coming from here,

01:23:34.695 --> 01:23:36.739
the outer layer
of the cerebral cortex.

01:23:36.822 --> 01:23:38.615
That's where
the memories are stored.

01:23:38.699 --> 01:23:40.075
- Thank you, Evan.
- Uh-huh.

01:23:40.159 --> 01:23:41.618
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:23:41.702 --> 01:23:44.455
We compared these
to the ones taken last year.

01:23:44.538 --> 01:23:47.624
We found severe haemorrhaging
and massive neural reconstruction.

01:23:47.708 --> 01:23:49.209
What does that mean for Evan?

01:23:49.293 --> 01:23:51.211
What he's saying, Mum,
is that I've jammed

01:23:51.295 --> 01:23:53.755
40 years worth of memories
into my head in the last year.

01:23:53.839 --> 01:23:56.550
It's overload city. I've completely
reprogrammed my brain.

01:23:56.633 --> 01:23:59.678
- That about the gist of it, doc?
- Yeah.

01:24:02.681 --> 01:24:05.267
Alright, I'm going
to go wait in the car.

01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:07.853
The light in here is kind
of bugging my eyes, so ...

01:24:07.936 --> 01:24:10.522
It was good seeing you, doc.
It really was.

01:24:10.606 --> 01:24:13.567
It was very ... very informative.

01:24:13.650 --> 01:24:16.069
But, you know,
I got people to see

01:24:16.153 --> 01:24:18.905
and things to read.

01:24:18.989 --> 01:24:20.866
Alright, see ya.

01:24:52.731 --> 01:24:54.065
Hey.

01:24:56.943 --> 01:24:58.486
It's me ...

01:24:58.570 --> 01:25:00.530
Evan.

01:25:00.613 --> 01:25:03.283
Can I get you anything?

01:25:05.618 --> 01:25:07.662
What about ...
what about some of those

01:25:07.745 --> 01:25:09.873
model airplanes you like, huh?

01:25:10.957 --> 01:25:12.542
I bet I can get a shitload

01:25:12.625 --> 01:25:15.044
of those model airplanes up in here.

01:25:17.171 --> 01:25:18.840
Lenny.

01:25:26.556 --> 01:25:28.975
You knew the whole time,
didn't you?

01:25:31.936 --> 01:25:36.399
When you put that shard
in my hand ...

01:25:38.735 --> 01:25:41.904
you knew something big
was going to happen.

01:25:41.988 --> 01:25:44.449
Didn't you?

01:25:45.783 --> 01:25:48.119
Yeah ...

01:25:48.202 --> 01:25:51.414
- I knew.
- Then you should be where I am.

01:25:55.084 --> 01:25:58.045
You should be

01:25:58.129 --> 01:26:00.047
where I am.

01:26:19.191 --> 01:26:22.278
'Today I get to meet my father.

01:26:23.362 --> 01:26:25.281
His name is Jason ...

01:26:26.490 --> 01:26:28.284
and he's crazy.

01:26:30.119 --> 01:26:32.288
I hope he let's me
call him "Dad."'

01:26:33.998 --> 01:26:36.375
You okay?
'Cause you look like

01:26:36.458 --> 01:26:38.544
you went somewhere else
there for a second.

01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:41.505
Look, Jason, I need some
fast answers from you

01:26:41.588 --> 01:26:44.425
if I'm ever gonna fix
what I've done.

01:26:44.508 --> 01:26:47.136
I was praying this curse
would have ended with me.

01:26:47.219 --> 01:26:48.762
Yeah, but it didn't.

01:26:48.846 --> 01:26:51.223
So now I need information
to make things right again

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:53.350
and you're the only one
that can give it to me.

01:26:53.434 --> 01:26:54.643
There is no right.

01:26:54.727 --> 01:26:57.980
You can't change who people are
without destroying who they were.

01:26:58.063 --> 01:27:00.566
Who says you can't
make things better?

01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:03.569
You can't play God, son.

01:27:04.903 --> 01:27:06.697
It must end with me.

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:10.033
Just by being here you may
be killing your mother.

01:27:10.117 --> 01:27:12.244
That's bullshit, you know?

01:27:12.327 --> 01:27:15.539
I'll send you a postcard when
I made everything perfect again.

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:19.001
Ahh! No, no!

01:27:40.564 --> 01:27:42.649
Just get out, did ya?

01:27:42.732 --> 01:27:44.776
Hmm?

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:48.196
Oh, nothing, just that my brother
did a stint in the pen

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.031
and he used to eat like that.

01:27:51.116 --> 01:27:53.952
I come from a big family.

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:55.870
Well, I meant no offence.

01:27:57.539 --> 01:27:58.748
None taken.

01:27:58.832 --> 01:28:01.167
Hey, uh ...

01:28:01.251 --> 01:28:03.253
Does Kayleigh Miller
still work here?

01:28:04.796 --> 01:28:06.798
I'm sorry.
I never heard of her.

01:28:24.482 --> 01:28:28.736
God! Can't a man get a little
goddamned peace in his own house?!

01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:35.118
I don't suppose
you're here to sell cookies?

01:28:35.201 --> 01:28:36.995
Good guess, fuckbag.

01:28:38.621 --> 01:28:40.623
Remember me, huh?

01:28:40.707 --> 01:28:42.959
We had a nice chat once
when I was seven.

01:28:45.044 --> 01:28:47.171
I got one question for you.

01:28:47.255 --> 01:28:49.173
Where can I find
your daughter?

01:29:23.082 --> 01:29:25.376
Oh, I thought
you were someone else.

01:29:30.047 --> 01:29:32.258
Make it fast,
I'm expecting someone.

01:29:34.552 --> 01:29:37.680
Hey. It's good to see you.

01:29:39.014 --> 01:29:40.599
Can I come in?

01:29:40.683 --> 01:29:42.518
If I knew you were coming,

01:29:42.601 --> 01:29:44.937
I would have cleaned
the stains off the sheets.

01:29:51.944 --> 01:29:54.113
What do you want?

01:29:54.196 --> 01:29:56.699
I just needed to see
a friendly face.

01:29:56.782 --> 01:29:59.618
Well, time is money, Evan.

01:30:01.703 --> 01:30:03.413
Money.

01:30:03.497 --> 01:30:08.043
I guess I can spare 10 minutes
for an old friend, right?

01:30:08.127 --> 01:30:11.129
So, how's tricks?

01:30:11.213 --> 01:30:13.507
Sorry, occupational humour.

01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:15.217
I got it.

01:30:16.301 --> 01:30:18.470
You can stop now.

01:30:18.554 --> 01:30:20.722
Oh, sorry.

01:30:20.806 --> 01:30:24.601
Does my line of work
make you uncomfortable, precious?

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:28.397
No, just that you felt like
you had to use it to hurt me.

01:30:31.817 --> 01:30:33.985
I've been where you've been.

01:30:34.069 --> 01:30:35.570
Ha!

01:30:35.654 --> 01:30:37.114
Where is that?

01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:41.743
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

01:30:41.827 --> 01:30:43.495
I know people always say that,

01:30:43.578 --> 01:30:45.330
that you wouldn't believe me,

01:30:45.413 --> 01:30:47.707
but in this case
it's not even worth trying, so ...

01:30:51.836 --> 01:30:54.172
I knew I needed to find you,

01:30:54.256 --> 01:30:56.091
so I went over to your dad's

01:30:56.174 --> 01:30:58.176
and made him tell me
where you were.

01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.345
Then I came here
and the rest you know.

01:31:00.428 --> 01:31:02.555
You're right, Evan,
I don't believe you.

01:31:02.639 --> 01:31:05.016
I never thought you would.

01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:07.435
That's why I never bothered
to tell a soul until now

01:31:07.519 --> 01:31:09.688
and I never will again.

01:31:09.771 --> 01:31:11.689
I'm the only person you've told?

01:31:12.774 --> 01:31:14.359
That's a great line.

01:31:14.442 --> 01:31:17.153
Does that make other girls wet?

01:31:17.237 --> 01:31:19.906
Do they actually
eat up that bullshit?

01:31:22.575 --> 01:31:26.746
You know, I could give a shit
whether you believe me or not.

01:31:26.829 --> 01:31:29.832
Frankly, I'm too tired
to prove it to you ...

01:31:29.916 --> 01:31:31.960
Oh, there's proof now, huh?

01:31:33.503 --> 01:31:36.464
How else would I know you have
twin moles on your inner thigh?

01:31:36.547 --> 01:31:39.300
Anyone with 50 bucks
could tell you that.

01:31:39.384 --> 01:31:41.177
Okay.

01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:43.429
Forget that.

01:31:43.513 --> 01:31:45.723
How about the fact
that you prefer

01:31:45.807 --> 01:31:48.267
the smell of skunk to flowers?

01:31:48.351 --> 01:31:50.812
Or that you hate cilantro

01:31:50.895 --> 01:31:53.022
because for some reason
unknown to you

01:31:53.106 --> 01:31:55.066
it reminds you
of your stepsister?

01:31:55.149 --> 01:31:58.820
Or that when you have an orgasm,
your toes go numb?

01:31:58.903 --> 01:32:01.739
I'm sure all of your clientele
are privy to that.

01:32:04.909 --> 01:32:08.412
You know? Look, I just
thought you should know.

01:32:08.496 --> 01:32:10.498
Know what?

01:32:10.581 --> 01:32:13.542
That you were happy once ...

01:32:14.961 --> 01:32:16.712
with me.

01:32:18.214 --> 01:32:20.758
You know there's one
major hole in your story.

01:32:20.841 --> 01:32:23.386
There's no fucking way
on this planet

01:32:23.469 --> 01:32:26.639
or any other, I would ever be
in some fucking sorority!

01:32:30.976 --> 01:32:32.520
You were happy there.

01:32:32.603 --> 01:32:34.522
Oh, you're crying?

01:32:34.605 --> 01:32:37.399
You sure you don't
want your wallet?

01:32:37.483 --> 01:32:39.235
No, I don't need it
where I'm going.

01:32:39.318 --> 01:32:42.488
What, are you off to change
everyone else's life again? Is that it?

01:32:42.571 --> 01:32:45.157
Maybe next time you'll pop up
in some mansion

01:32:45.241 --> 01:32:47.826
while I end up in Tijuana
doing some donkey act.

01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:50.454
You know what? I'm over it.

01:32:50.537 --> 01:32:52.873
Every time
I try to help someone

01:32:52.957 --> 01:32:54.500
everything just goes to shit.

01:32:54.583 --> 01:32:57.044
Well, don't give up now, slick.

01:32:57.127 --> 01:32:59.421
Hell, you've already
done so much for me.

01:32:59.505 --> 01:33:01.840
Why don't you go back in time

01:33:01.924 --> 01:33:04.843
and save Mrs. Halpern
and her baby?

01:33:04.927 --> 01:33:09.723
And then maybe Lenny wouldn't
freak out and ruin my family.

01:33:09.807 --> 01:33:12.518
No, go back
to when I was seven

01:33:12.601 --> 01:33:16.230
and fuck me in front
of my daddy's video camera.

01:33:17.564 --> 01:33:20.526
Straighten me out a bit.

01:33:34.122 --> 01:33:36.375
You're on my bed.
Get out!

01:33:36.458 --> 01:33:40.420
Buddy, I thought it would be okay
what with you being sick and all.

01:33:50.555 --> 01:33:52.516
I'm not going to say it again.

01:34:00.273 --> 01:34:02.651
'The last thing I remember
before the blackout

01:34:02.734 --> 01:34:04.903
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

01:34:04.986 --> 01:34:07.781
I think I was more focused
on her hands on mine

01:34:07.864 --> 01:34:09.616
than on the mailbox
across the street.'

01:34:16.748 --> 01:34:18.875
Lady, stay back!
Don't go near the mailbox!

01:34:18.958 --> 01:34:21.920
- Idiots!
- I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!

01:34:22.003 --> 01:34:24.297
I'll save you, lady!

01:34:32.305 --> 01:34:35.141
God damn it, I thought
I told you two to get out.

01:34:36.809 --> 01:34:38.728
Oh, sorry, man.
Did we wake you?

01:34:40.313 --> 01:34:43.107
No, it's cool.

01:34:43.191 --> 01:34:45.151
Okay.

01:34:47.695 --> 01:34:49.489
It's really cool.

01:35:10.593 --> 01:35:12.303
What the fuck is this?

01:35:18.893 --> 01:35:21.520
- Please save his arm!
- Can you open up my locker?

01:35:21.604 --> 01:35:24.482
- Happy Birthday!
- Can I come too?

01:35:24.565 --> 01:35:26.192
Do you want me
to hold your popcorn?

01:35:27.568 --> 01:35:30.488
Evan? Get a towel!
Get a towel!

01:35:30.571 --> 01:35:32.573
Evan! Oh my God!

01:35:32.656 --> 01:35:34.867
Evan! Evan!
Evan!

01:35:36.243 --> 01:35:37.953
Hey, where you going?

01:35:38.037 --> 01:35:40.456
You ever notice Kayleigh's smile?
I love her smile.

01:35:40.539 --> 01:35:42.541
Lenny's the best.

01:35:42.625 --> 01:35:44.502
You guys make a great couple.

01:35:44.585 --> 01:35:46.587
You ever think
that I'll find someone?

01:35:48.339 --> 01:35:49.465
Evan!

01:35:52.509 --> 01:35:55.054
Where are we going?

01:35:55.137 --> 01:35:57.139
We're taking you
to the hospital, Evan.

01:35:57.222 --> 01:36:00.225
- No, take me back.
- Sorry, your mum would kill me.

01:36:02.269 --> 01:36:04.480
- Oh.
- You take me back, Lenny!

01:36:05.564 --> 01:36:08.275
You owe me that much.

01:36:13.322 --> 01:36:14.907
What are you geeks
looking at?

01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:17.409
It must be nice to be
so goddamed perfect, huh?

01:36:17.493 --> 01:36:20.871
Fucking losers!
Lenny, help me!

01:36:20.954 --> 01:36:23.123
Here, get him over.
Get him over.

01:36:24.583 --> 01:36:27.628
Hey, Brian, how's
your head feeling, buddy?

01:36:27.711 --> 01:36:29.546
I saw that girl
you went home with.

01:36:29.630 --> 01:36:31.715
Did she borrow
your razor this morning?

01:36:31.798 --> 01:36:33.550
You're so bad.

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:37.888
Hey, there's Tommy.
Hey, Tommy! Tommy!

01:36:37.971 --> 01:36:40.766
Hey, what's up, guys?

01:36:41.933 --> 01:36:44.019
Hey, man,
I did what you said.

01:36:44.102 --> 01:36:46.813
We're pooling our student funds
with the Hillel house

01:36:46.897 --> 01:36:48.982
and we're having
an awareness dance.

01:36:49.066 --> 01:36:51.610
Oh, awesome.
Maybe I can spin my chair around

01:36:51.693 --> 01:36:53.904
to a techno remix
of 'Hava Nagila' till I puke.

01:36:55.489 --> 01:36:57.365
Maybe we should be
getting to class now.

01:36:57.449 --> 01:36:59.159
What's the point
of psych class now?

01:36:59.242 --> 01:37:02.037
Tomorrow I could wake up
a dirt farmer in Bangladesh.

01:37:03.413 --> 01:37:04.915
Let's go for a stroll.

01:37:06.082 --> 01:37:07.417
Bye, babe.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.419
- Yippee.
- Bye, sis.

01:37:09.502 --> 01:37:10.921
What's up with him?

01:37:11.004 --> 01:37:13.840
So Tommy's really
into this Jesus freak thing, huh?

01:37:13.923 --> 01:37:15.967
You know how spiritual
he's gotten

01:37:16.051 --> 01:37:18.428
ever since he saved
Mrs. Halpern and Katie.

01:37:19.971 --> 01:37:22.557
He saved Mrs. Halpern?

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.726
Please. The twisted fuck.

01:37:26.102 --> 01:37:28.438
Here, why don't we sit right here?

01:37:36.362 --> 01:37:37.947
Want a granola bar?

01:37:40.617 --> 01:37:42.118
Here, just ...

01:37:46.331 --> 01:37:48.708
Yeah, I gotta fix
these things or something.

01:37:51.628 --> 01:37:53.629
Kayleigh ...

01:37:53.713 --> 01:37:55.548
do you ever think about us?

01:37:55.631 --> 01:37:58.593
I mean, do you ever wonder

01:37:58.676 --> 01:38:01.429
if things might have been
different between us?

01:38:01.512 --> 01:38:03.222
Sure, Evan.

01:38:05.767 --> 01:38:08.394
You were the first person
I really ever cared about.

01:38:10.396 --> 01:38:12.815
- I was?
- Yeah.

01:38:14.150 --> 01:38:17.195
That's why when I was little,
I never went to live with my mother.

01:38:18.404 --> 01:38:20.573
I don't get it.

01:38:20.656 --> 01:38:22.867
When ... when my folks split up,

01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:25.953
they gave me and Tommy a choice
of who we wanted to live with.

01:38:26.037 --> 01:38:28.748
And I couldn't stand my dad.

01:38:28.831 --> 01:38:31.876
But I knew that if I went
to move with my mum,

01:38:31.959 --> 01:38:34.462
I'd never see you again.

01:38:34.545 --> 01:38:36.297
I didn't know that.

01:38:37.965 --> 01:38:41.135
So you still think about us ...

01:38:41.218 --> 01:38:42.970
together?

01:38:44.638 --> 01:38:48.100
Well, it's crossed my mind
from time to time.

01:38:48.184 --> 01:38:50.352
And?

01:38:50.436 --> 01:38:53.147
Well, a lot of things
have crossed my mind, Ev.

01:38:53.230 --> 01:38:57.651
I mean, I could play out the entire movie of
our lives in one second.

01:38:57.735 --> 01:38:59.695
Boom, we fall in love.
We get married.

01:38:59.778 --> 01:39:03.574
We have kids.
Our kids grow old, as do we.

01:39:03.657 --> 01:39:06.201
Matching burial plots.
The whole thing.

01:39:07.703 --> 01:39:10.706
Plah, it took a lot longer
to spit out than to imagine.

01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:15.085
Things like that usually do.

01:39:17.337 --> 01:39:19.089
So ...

01:39:19.173 --> 01:39:21.175
do you think that
it might have worked?

01:39:21.258 --> 01:39:23.343
Yeah.

01:39:25.387 --> 01:39:27.514
I mean, but that's
not how things wound up.

01:39:29.975 --> 01:39:32.019
I'm with Lenny.

01:39:33.228 --> 01:39:35.272
Lenny is your friend

01:39:35.355 --> 01:39:37.649
and ...

01:39:37.733 --> 01:39:39.443
and that's where it ends.

01:39:42.237 --> 01:39:44.072
Well ...

01:39:45.282 --> 01:39:48.243
would it make a difference
if I told you that

01:39:48.326 --> 01:39:52.414
no one could possibly ever
love anyone as much as I love you?

01:40:01.423 --> 01:40:04.926
I'm not saying that. I ...

01:40:05.010 --> 01:40:08.513
- Yeah.
- I'm not ... I'm just saying it like

01:40:08.597 --> 01:40:11.683
if you were a girl,
would that be something

01:40:11.766 --> 01:40:13.602
that you would want to hear?

01:40:17.397 --> 01:40:19.357
Hold on one second.
Lenny's calling.

01:40:19.441 --> 01:40:21.401
I'll be right back, Ev, okay?

01:40:27.574 --> 01:40:29.534
He's a little down ...

01:40:30.618 --> 01:40:32.370
I love you.

01:41:28.884 --> 01:41:30.803
You forgot to put
the toaster on the ledge.

01:41:32.305 --> 01:41:35.516
Lenny likes Pop Tarts.

01:41:35.599 --> 01:41:37.810
You guys are all
that matter now.

01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:42.940
Man, I know it's hard,
but you can't give up.

01:41:43.023 --> 01:41:45.943
I can't even
fucking kill myself.

01:41:46.026 --> 01:41:47.862
Don't talk like that.

01:41:57.496 --> 01:41:59.790
Alright, I've got
to get you out of here.

01:41:59.874 --> 01:42:02.167
Visiting hours
are almost over.

01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:08.757
Did Mum
get transferred again?

01:42:08.841 --> 01:42:11.885
What are you talking about?
She's been here the entire time.

01:42:19.393 --> 01:42:23.147
Looking ... good, kiddo.

01:42:28.819 --> 01:42:30.112
Lung cancer.

01:42:31.947 --> 01:42:34.700
Lung cancer?

01:42:34.783 --> 01:42:38.036
You started chain smoking
when I blew myself up.

01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:40.998
Sorry, Mrs. T, he's been
acting out of sorts lately.

01:42:41.081 --> 01:42:44.084
- I think I could fix this.
- Fix?

01:42:44.167 --> 01:42:47.170
I just need the journal entry
about the blockbuster.

01:42:49.548 --> 01:42:52.300
Shit, no arms.

01:42:52.384 --> 01:42:54.261
I never wrote it.

01:42:54.344 --> 01:42:58.348
You're ... acting ... different.

01:42:58.432 --> 01:43:01.601
No, he's just going through
tough times right now.

01:43:01.685 --> 01:43:03.562
Mum ...

01:43:03.645 --> 01:43:05.439
you're going to be okay.

01:43:05.522 --> 01:43:07.232
I can change it.

01:43:07.315 --> 01:43:09.609
Um, maybe ... I wanna go
down to the chapel.

01:43:10.694 --> 01:43:15.448
You're ... acting ...

01:43:15.532 --> 01:43:18.952
just like your father.

01:43:19.035 --> 01:43:22.580
Just 'cause he went crazy
when he was my age,

01:43:22.664 --> 01:43:25.166
doesn't mean
I'm gonna go crazy, Mum.

01:43:26.459 --> 01:43:30.088
How ... did ...

01:43:30.171 --> 01:43:32.966
you ... know that?

01:43:33.049 --> 01:43:35.552
You told me ...

01:43:35.635 --> 01:43:37.720
on parent's weekend,
remember?

01:43:41.724 --> 01:43:43.852
It wasn't me ...

01:43:44.978 --> 01:43:47.147
- Just ...
... or you.

01:43:47.230 --> 01:43:50.358
Like ... Jason.

01:43:50.441 --> 01:43:52.151
You don't worry, Mum,

01:43:52.235 --> 01:43:55.071
I'm going to get you
out of here. Okay?

01:43:55.154 --> 01:43:56.072
No.

01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:58.658
You're not going
to hurt anymore.

01:43:58.741 --> 01:44:00.702
I'm going to fix it.

01:44:00.785 --> 01:44:01.828
No.

01:44:03.329 --> 01:44:05.415
No, no.

01:44:08.543 --> 01:44:10.002
Are you sure
you even packed it?

01:44:10.086 --> 01:44:11.838
My mum packed it.

01:44:11.921 --> 01:44:14.006
I think she sent
everything I ever owned.

01:44:14.090 --> 01:44:16.217
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:18.386
What do you want it for?
I don't get you lately.

01:44:18.469 --> 01:44:20.054
Duly noted.

01:44:23.266 --> 01:44:25.017
Okay, I have to ask you
one last favour.

01:44:25.101 --> 01:44:27.144
- What?
- I need you to be quiet.

01:44:27.228 --> 01:44:30.106
I have to concentrate
if I wanna destroy the blockbuster.

01:44:30.189 --> 01:44:34.151
- What? What, the blockbuster?
- If I hadn't blown off my arms,

01:44:34.235 --> 01:44:37.238
my mum would've never started
smoking in the first place.

01:44:37.321 --> 01:44:39.240
Never mind. Just open it.

01:44:41.367 --> 01:44:43.035
Turn it.

01:44:43.119 --> 01:44:45.454
There.

01:44:49.208 --> 01:44:51.293
'Today Mummy
is taking me to play

01:44:51.377 --> 01:44:53.212
with Kayleigh and Tommy.

01:44:53.295 --> 01:44:56.632
I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.'

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.137
Now, how do I destroy
the blockbuster?

01:45:17.361 --> 01:45:20.906
Evan, what are you
doing with that knife?

01:45:24.326 --> 01:45:28.497
Well, that didn't work.
Go on, turn it.

01:45:29.706 --> 01:45:31.291
Turn it. There.

01:45:32.918 --> 01:45:35.546
'I never wanted
to be in the movie anyway.

01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:38.090
It was cold so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

01:45:38.173 --> 01:45:40.175
But Mr. Miller made me
take my shirt off.'

01:45:40.259 --> 01:45:42.010
In this part of the story,

01:45:42.094 --> 01:45:45.722
Robin Hood has just
married Maid Marian.

01:45:45.806 --> 01:45:49.268
And they have
to kiss and stuff,

01:45:49.351 --> 01:45:50.936
like grown-ups do.

01:45:51.019 --> 01:45:52.938
Wait, I need my belt.

01:45:59.945 --> 01:46:02.739
Hey, don't even
bother about a belt.

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:06.410
- Hey.
- Back off, fuckbag.

01:46:06.493 --> 01:46:09.538
Amazing that word never fails
to make an impression with you.

01:46:09.621 --> 01:46:12.124
Easy does it, Evan.

01:46:12.207 --> 01:46:15.210
Don't be a bad boy
or I'll tell your mother

01:46:15.293 --> 01:46:17.254
what a naughty
little shit you are.

01:46:17.337 --> 01:46:19.297
And I'll tell
Child Protective Services

01:46:19.381 --> 01:46:21.591
about your little
kiddie porn endeavours.

01:46:21.675 --> 01:46:23.885
One step closer
and I'll shove this up your arse.

01:46:23.969 --> 01:46:26.304
Hey, that's dangerous.
You could blow off your hand.

01:46:26.388 --> 01:46:28.515
Been there, done that.

01:46:31.017 --> 01:46:32.185
Hey!

01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:38.149
- Sparkler.
- Kayleigh, no!

01:46:38.233 --> 01:46:40.902
No! Kayleigh, no!

01:46:48.743 --> 01:46:50.036
Hey, man.

01:46:51.704 --> 01:46:53.498
... good, kiddo.

01:46:53.581 --> 01:46:56.459
I've got no choice but to commit you
to Sunnyvale Institution ...

01:46:56.543 --> 01:46:59.003
You're gonna have to live
somewhere else for a while.

01:46:59.087 --> 01:47:01.172
- A squashed butterfly.
- I want my mummy!

01:47:01.256 --> 01:47:02.632
I'm so sick of this!

01:47:02.715 --> 01:47:04.717
I think we should
up your medication.

01:47:34.205 --> 01:47:36.040
Where are
my goddamn books?

01:47:36.123 --> 01:47:39.210
Hey, Evan, we're not supposed
to meet for another hour.

01:47:39.293 --> 01:47:41.629
Where are
my goddamn books?

01:47:41.712 --> 01:47:44.256
Books?

01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:46.300
My journals.

01:47:46.384 --> 01:47:48.344
L ... I need them.

01:47:48.427 --> 01:47:52.390
So, if you'd give 'em to me,
it'd help a lot.

01:47:52.473 --> 01:47:54.642
It really hurts me
to go through this again.

01:47:55.810 --> 01:47:57.728
There are no journals.

01:47:57.812 --> 01:47:59.855
There never were.

01:47:59.939 --> 01:48:02.733
It's part of the fantasy world
that your mind created

01:48:02.817 --> 01:48:06.195
to cope with the guilt
of killing Kayleigh Miller.

01:48:06.278 --> 01:48:09.281
Think, Evan, think.

01:48:09.365 --> 01:48:11.867
You've created a disease
that does not exist ...

01:48:12.993 --> 01:48:15.079
alternate universes with colleges

01:48:15.162 --> 01:48:17.539
and prisons and paraplegia.

01:48:17.623 --> 01:48:20.584
I want my journals
and I want 'em now!

01:48:20.668 --> 01:48:23.587
And I know that you got 'em
and you're gonna give 'em to me!

01:48:23.671 --> 01:48:26.048
You're not going to hide them
from me. I want them!

01:48:28.008 --> 01:48:30.511
You're reminding me
of your father.

01:48:30.594 --> 01:48:32.846
He was always screaming
for a photo album

01:48:32.930 --> 01:48:34.932
even though
he never had one.

01:48:36.517 --> 01:48:38.227
I'm so sorry.

01:48:42.022 --> 01:48:44.274
A photo album?

01:48:44.358 --> 01:48:47.069
- Photos.
- Evan?

01:48:49.196 --> 01:48:52.532
The damage is irreparable.

01:48:57.871 --> 01:49:01.208
Frankly, I'm surprised he still
has use of his motor functions.

01:49:11.343 --> 01:49:13.720
Mum?

01:49:13.804 --> 01:49:16.973
Um, did you remember to bring

01:49:17.057 --> 01:49:19.226
those home movies
that we used to make?

01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:22.187
Yeah, they're right here.

01:49:23.688 --> 01:49:27.776
Good, because I really like
to watch them.

01:49:31.613 --> 01:49:33.198
So that's good.

01:49:37.911 --> 01:49:40.497
I think it's best we
transfer him to Bellevue

01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:42.082
first thing in the morning.

01:50:24.624 --> 01:50:27.668
'If anyone finds this,

01:50:27.752 --> 01:50:32.381
... it means that my plan
didn't work ...

01:50:32.465 --> 01:50:34.884
... and I'm already dead.'

01:50:36.511 --> 01:50:39.430
He's not in his room.
Search the grounds.

01:50:39.514 --> 01:50:42.767
'If I can somehow go back ...

01:50:42.850 --> 01:50:45.269
... to the beginning of all of this ...

01:50:45.353 --> 01:50:50.024
... I might be able to save her.'

01:51:02.286 --> 01:51:04.705
I'm trying to have a baby.

01:51:16.050 --> 01:51:17.176
Go away.

01:51:32.024 --> 01:51:33.609
Something's wrong!

01:51:33.692 --> 01:51:35.402
It's killing me!

01:51:37.404 --> 01:51:40.032
Make it stop! Oh!

01:51:40.115 --> 01:51:41.992
Heart rate is decelerating.

01:51:42.076 --> 01:51:44.161
What's happening?!

01:51:44.244 --> 01:51:47.956
You have no lifeline, no soul.
You were never meant to be.

01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:49.500
He's choking himself!

01:51:49.583 --> 01:51:51.293
No!

01:51:51.376 --> 01:51:55.422
Okay, let's do a rapid sequence
intubation for a c-section, stat!

01:51:55.505 --> 01:51:58.967
- Save him!
- Not getting enough oxygen!

01:51:59.051 --> 01:52:02.095
- We're losing him, we're losing him!
- No!

01:52:02.179 --> 01:52:04.264
Before you were born,

01:52:04.348 --> 01:52:06.892
I was pregnant three times,

01:52:06.975 --> 01:52:09.269
but they were all stillbirths.

01:52:09.353 --> 01:52:12.564
I've kind of thought of you
as my miracle baby ever since.

01:52:13.690 --> 01:52:16.193
Not again!

01:52:16.276 --> 01:52:19.404
No!

01:52:21.031 --> 01:52:23.450
I couldn't stand my dad,

01:52:23.533 --> 01:52:27.537
but I knew that if I went
to live with my mum,

01:52:27.621 --> 01:52:30.207
I would never see you again.

01:52:56.983 --> 01:52:59.360
Kayleigh and Tommy!

01:53:01.946 --> 01:53:04.324
I missed you!

01:53:04.407 --> 01:53:07.493
I'll never let you guys
out of my sight again.

01:53:19.130 --> 01:53:21.966
Yeah!

01:53:25.595 --> 01:53:28.139
True happiness can only
be achieved through sacrifice,

01:53:28.222 --> 01:53:30.391
like the sacrifices
our parents have made.

01:53:30.475 --> 01:53:33.019
Whoo-hoo! Great! Tommy!
