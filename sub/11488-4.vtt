00:00.959 --> 00:02.557
Kandi, Kandi, listen to me.

00:02.562 --> 00:05.004
Our divorce does not
have to be adversarial.

00:05.145 --> 00:07.185
I bet she won't know that word.

00:07.512 --> 00:10.307
No, no, not "Ads for cereal".

00:11.582 --> 00:14.115
-Told 'ya.
-Do you know it?

00:14.255 --> 00:16.088
That wasn't the bet.

00:16.421 --> 00:20.600
Oh, come on, you're being very unfair.
I love Chester as much as you do.

00:20.903 --> 00:21.906
Oh really?

00:21.907 --> 00:24.915
Oh, then maybe you could explain to me
why I'm the one who feeds Chester,

00:24.916 --> 00:29.038
gives Chester tick baths, and cleans up
when Chester piddles on the rug.

00:29.090 --> 00:31.955
When did you change
your name to Chester?

00:34.675 --> 00:37.103
And it's not just me,
Jake loves that dog too.

00:37.190 --> 00:38.807
No, I don't.

00:39.863 --> 00:42.484
He slobbers and he threw up in my shoe.

00:42.938 --> 00:45.209
I had a date like that once.

00:45.820 --> 00:48.703
You'd think it would have
slow me down but no...

00:48.930 --> 00:51.131
All right, all right.
Can I at least talk to him?

00:51.183 --> 00:55.097
My father talks to dogs
and they send me to a psychologist.

00:55.238 --> 00:58.486
Hello, Chester?
It's Daddy!

00:59.255 --> 01:03.168
Who's a good boy?
You're a good boy.

01:03.674 --> 01:06.033
Yes you are!
Yes you are!

01:06.731 --> 01:09.033
Yes... Kandi, I wasn't finished.

01:09.508 --> 01:11.535
Yeah, well,
well I have rights here!

01:11.622 --> 01:15.658
And I intend to pursue those rights
with all the means at my disposal.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.208
Yeah!
Well, OK, OK, goodbye!

01:20.881 --> 01:22.593
-Alan?
-Yeah?

01:22.680 --> 01:24.986
Who's a moron?
You're a moron!

01:25.039 --> 01:27.467
Yes you are!
Yes you are!

01:28.864 --> 01:32.441
Well, it may be funny to you,
but that dog means a lot to me.

01:33.350 --> 01:35.830
It's really about the dog
or is it about Kandi?

01:35.831 --> 01:37.403
It's about the dog!

01:37.420 --> 01:39.936
I mean, we bought a condo,
she's keeping it.

01:39.937 --> 01:42.766
We bought a car, she's keeping it.
What do I get to keep?

01:42.975 --> 01:45.159
Certainly not your dignity.

01:46.873 --> 01:49.074
OK, let's look at the big picture.

01:49.266 --> 01:51.990
You're a middle-aged guy,
who married a stupid woman,

01:52.026 --> 01:54.140
half his age, for no other reason
that the sex was great.

01:54.175 --> 01:55.537
You're with me so far?

01:55.904 --> 01:57.040
Yeah.

01:57.110 --> 02:01.024
Good. Then you ran out of money,
she got bored and threw you out.

02:01.574 --> 02:02.780
What's your point?

02:02.818 --> 02:07.077
Why does everything need a point,
why can't I just make fun of you.

02:07.666 --> 02:09.639
I want my dog, Charlie.

02:09.675 --> 02:13.256
There'll be other dogs...
not in my house.

02:14.914 --> 02:18.598
Just remember, the worst thing you can
do is fight over who gets what.

02:18.602 --> 02:21.048
-The trick is to give her everything.
-Everything?

02:21.049 --> 02:23.441
Whatever she wants,
because when all is said and done,

02:23.442 --> 02:27.197
you'll get the one thing that matters most,
the thing you can't put a price on.

02:27.249 --> 02:28.542
My dignity?

02:28.572 --> 02:31.036
Oh stop it,
that ship has sailed...

02:32.818 --> 02:34.233
No, no...

02:34.250 --> 02:38.810
The thing you get, is freedom,
the opportunity to start over.

02:38.949 --> 02:41.692
Maybe a little sadder,
but a whole lot wiser.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.382
And the next time you'll meet a woman,
and trust me, you will,

02:44.452 --> 02:48.488
you'll have a real shot
at true and lasting happiness.

02:49.312 --> 02:51.723
I want my dog.

02:53.808 --> 02:58.350
Well, good luck with that, because
I was lying about the other stuff.

03:27.243 --> 03:29.667
Listen,
why don't we share custody of Chester?

03:29.689 --> 03:32.780
You know, you get one week,
and I get one week.

03:32.964 --> 03:35.041
It doesn't make any difference.

03:35.348 --> 03:39.442
Dog weeks and people weeks
are the same thing.

03:41.626 --> 03:44.492
Hey dad, how come
you don't give me an allowance?

03:44.526 --> 03:47.631
Because your mother gives you an allowance.
Look, I'm just trying to be fair here.

03:47.632 --> 03:51.760
Speaking of fair, it doesn't seem fair
that mom has to pay me and you don't.

03:51.896 --> 03:54.592
Hang on, Kandi.
Let me explain something to you,

03:54.593 --> 03:57.047
every cent your mother has,
comes from me.

03:57.048 --> 04:00.051
So when she gives you an allowance,
it's really me giving you an allowance.

04:00.085 --> 04:03.788
I don't need to know how it works,
I just need more money.

04:06.498 --> 04:07.796
Take a number.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.945
-Sorry, go ahead.
-Six.

04:13.973 --> 04:14.912
Morning.

04:15.372 --> 04:16.269
Morning.

04:16.505 --> 04:19.003
Look, if Chester is gonna
live anywhere full time,

04:19.027 --> 04:22.332
-I don't see why it shouldn't be here.
-I do, I see why.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.609
When he split with your mother,

04:25.610 --> 04:27.581
did they fight like this
over your custody?

04:27.589 --> 04:31.013
They still do.
"You take him. No you take him."

04:31.669 --> 04:33.435
OK, OK, OK, fine.

04:33.464 --> 04:37.332
You want this to get ugly, you want
to play hardball, I will play hardball.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.733
How come you don't give me an allowance?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.198
What are you, drunk?

04:43.235 --> 04:47.033
Well, I am gonna get a lawyer,
I'm gonna take you to court, yeah!

04:47.098 --> 04:49.267
And then we'll just see
who gets Chester.

04:49.286 --> 04:52.725
Yeah! Yeah! Well, well,
have your lawyer call my lawyer!

05:02.198 --> 05:03.935
You know a lawyer?

05:12.820 --> 05:13.918
Oh...

05:15.005 --> 05:15.690
Hi.

05:15.718 --> 05:17.136
What do you want, Alan?

05:17.610 --> 05:19.975
Huh, OK, right to it huh?

05:21.477 --> 05:23.871
As you know,
Kandi and I are splitting up...

05:24.145 --> 05:25.957
Yeah, * quelle surprise. *

05:27.918 --> 05:29.410
* Merci. *

05:30.898 --> 05:35.706
Anyhoo, I'm gonna need a good lawyer,
and, huh... I thought, you know,

05:35.912 --> 05:40.531
who better than the rabid jackal who
ripped my lungs out in my first divorce?

05:41.031 --> 05:42.580
You want my lawyer?

05:42.589 --> 05:44.810
Well I certainly don't want mine.

05:45.533 --> 05:47.787
Gee Alan, I'm sorry but
I can't give him to you.

05:47.862 --> 05:50.810
-Why not?
-Because I already gave him to Kandi.

05:51.373 --> 05:53.133
You're joking, right?

05:53.268 --> 05:55.552
I'm smiling, but I'm not joking.

05:57.425 --> 05:58.975
Why would you do that?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.350
I don't know, kicks...

06:01.942 --> 06:05.071
Oh Judith, when did you start
hating me so much?

06:05.294 --> 06:08.759
Well let's see...
I disliked you when we were married,

06:08.835 --> 06:11.866
I resented you when we divorced,
but I don't think I hated you

06:11.867 --> 06:15.976
until you started having sex with
that gorgeous 22 year-old dumbbell.

06:16.385 --> 06:19.036
-OK, well thanks for clearing that up.
-Bye bye.

06:23.629 --> 06:25.959
Look, if you really want
to make some extra cash,

06:25.960 --> 06:28.455
I'm sure we can find
some household chores for you to do.

06:28.456 --> 06:31.131
Oh yeah, there's big money in that.

06:32.577 --> 06:34.509
What kind of chores?

06:34.546 --> 06:36.032
Well, let see...

06:36.035 --> 06:39.497
Take out the garbage,
sweep up the garage, wash my car.

06:39.511 --> 06:41.457
No, none of those sound good.

06:45.215 --> 06:46.858
I'll tell you what,

06:48.985 --> 06:51.198
I'll give you 10 bucks,

06:51.339 --> 06:54.642
if you can eat this entire tub
of ice cream in less than 20 minutes.

06:54.644 --> 06:55.677
OK...

06:55.714 --> 07:00.429
Charlie, that will shoot out of him
like Ben & Jerry on rocket skates.

07:01.227 --> 07:03.847
Here, eat these instead.

07:04.269 --> 07:08.386
By the time they get through you,
it'll be your mother's problem.

07:09.052 --> 07:11.390
-All of them in 20 minutes, right?
-Yep

07:11.756 --> 07:14.065
Then can I have the ice cream?

07:16.257 --> 07:17.976
Oh oh...

07:30.389 --> 07:32.656
Alan, you should have called.

07:32.932 --> 07:35.302
I didn't feel like calling,
I want to see my dog.

07:35.377 --> 07:37.492
Well maybe he doesn't want to see you.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.097
Why don't we let him decide?

07:39.125 --> 07:41.510
No, he's been through enough.

07:41.661 --> 07:43.736
Oh really?
Did he tell you that?

07:43.755 --> 07:45.502
How could he tell me anything?

07:45.520 --> 07:49.182
You know as well as I do
that he keeps everything bottled up.

07:49.316 --> 07:52.706
-Dammit Kandi, I want to see my dog...
-Don't you yell at me...

07:52.818 --> 07:55.494
If you have anything to say,
you can say it to my lawyer.

07:55.495 --> 07:56.663
Maybe I will.

07:56.837 --> 08:00.133
Honey, Alan has something
he wants to say to you.

08:01.274 --> 08:02.720
Hey Alan.

08:04.588 --> 08:05.950
What's up?

08:08.545 --> 08:10.710
It's you...

08:10.711 --> 08:12.188
the jackal!

08:13.549 --> 08:15.239
Oh that hurts.

08:15.596 --> 08:19.953
Listen, as long as you're here,
is your billing address still the same?

08:20.047 --> 08:21.915
-Huh huh.
-Great.

08:22.026 --> 08:24.644
Well, I guess I'll see you in court.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.930
Oh, and don't worry, I'm not
gonna bill you for this consultation,

08:28.016 --> 08:30.750
there's nothing legal billing on here.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.070
Un-freaking-believable.

08:41.124 --> 08:43.669
It's like watching a pot-smoking monkey.

08:44.460 --> 08:46.277
10 dollars, please.

08:46.497 --> 08:51.451
Serves me right, betting against a kid
who can eat a happy meal, toys and all...

08:52.310 --> 08:53.602
Thank you.

08:54.424 --> 08:55.842
what are you doing?

08:55.880 --> 08:58.039
You told me how to
always do my own count.

08:58.086 --> 09:00.027
Yeah but you can trust me.

09:00.358 --> 09:04.030
Seven, eight, nine!?

09:06.433 --> 09:09.340
It was an honest mistake.

09:09.401 --> 09:11.306
I'm sure.

09:12.911 --> 09:15.156
So what are you gonna do
with your winnings?

09:15.157 --> 09:16.369
It's a secret.

09:16.370 --> 09:18.404
-So it's a girl.
-How do you know?

09:18.439 --> 09:20.852
-I didn't
-Then it isn't.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.664
Come on, tell me about it,
maybe I can help.

09:24.683 --> 09:26.216
I don't think so.

09:26.235 --> 09:29.227
Are you kidding me? Who knows more
about girls than your uncle Charlie?

09:29.284 --> 09:32.598
Warren Beatty, Bill Clinton,
Rosie O'Donnell...

09:34.912 --> 09:39.231
Why should I talk to you? You've messed up
every relationship you've ever been in.

09:39.250 --> 09:42.859
-Well, yeah, but..
-So you're not exactly a good example.

09:42.860 --> 09:43.549
I get it.

09:43.559 --> 09:45.554
I mean, if I only wanted
to have one-night stands...

09:45.555 --> 09:48.053
Alright! Alright,
you've made your point.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.527
-So don't talk to me.
-I won't.

09:49.528 --> 09:50.476
-OK.
-OK.

09:50.477 --> 09:51.574
Good.

09:57.152 --> 09:59.067
Will you drive me to the mall?

09:59.114 --> 10:01.039
-Why?
-It's private.

10:01.124 --> 10:03.031
So is my car.

10:04.598 --> 10:07.048
Alright, I want to buy a present.

10:07.133 --> 10:09.330
-For?
-It's a secret.

10:09.465 --> 10:12.016
-I'll throw in another 10.
-Wendy Chow.

10:12.280 --> 10:15.529
Haha! A present for Wendy Chow!

10:15.811 --> 10:18.697
Now, is this an offering
to grease the wheels,

10:18.772 --> 10:22.076
or a parting gift for the wheels
having already been greased?

10:22.114 --> 10:26.541
Grease the wheels? See, that's why
I don't talk to you about this stuff.

10:28.081 --> 10:30.996
Well, he may be
as dull as a butter knife,

10:30.997 --> 10:34.160
but you gotta admit,
he's a good judge of character.

10:45.035 --> 10:48.171
Are you sure it doesn't have
anything to do with sex?

10:48.237 --> 10:51.616
-Positive.
-Huh? Sure sounds like it.

10:51.813 --> 10:54.189
Subpoenas...

11:02.818 --> 11:07.362
Hang in there Chester, Daddy is coming.
Oh please please please...

11:08.927 --> 11:11.894
Yes!
She didn't change the lock.

11:16.498 --> 11:18.973
But that's new.

11:22.427 --> 11:23.967
I like those...

11:24.651 --> 11:26.290
Skull earrings?

11:26.502 --> 11:29.253
Yeah, they're silver
and they got ruby eyes.

11:29.854 --> 11:33.297
OK first of all,
for 11.95, those aren't rubies.

11:33.441 --> 11:35.093
You don't know that.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.099
Oh but I do...

11:38.089 --> 11:41.866
And second, girls like
Wendy Chow don't wear skull earrings.

11:41.879 --> 11:43.006
How do you know?

11:43.025 --> 11:45.283
She gets straights As, right?
She plays violin?

11:45.284 --> 11:47.198
She's also the captain
of the math Team.

11:47.199 --> 11:49.170
Exactly.
So you see my point?

11:49.304 --> 11:51.316
Huhuh, OK.

11:53.094 --> 11:55.451
How about that skull belt-buckle?

11:57.217 --> 11:59.288
No skulls.

12:00.019 --> 12:03.719
Just out of curiosity,
does this Wendy Chow hate her parents?

12:04.133 --> 12:05.776
I don't think so, why?

12:05.786 --> 12:08.668
Just trying to get
a handle on the relationship.

12:08.969 --> 12:11.727
She said she likes me
'cause I'm unpretentious.

12:11.747 --> 12:12.883
You know what that means?

12:12.920 --> 12:14.966
It means she likes me.

12:16.185 --> 12:17.528
Yeah, OK...

12:18.232 --> 12:19.958
So what do you want
this gift to say?

12:20.241 --> 12:22.734
Huh... "Happy birthday"?

12:22.892 --> 12:24.939
A birthday card says "happy birthday",

12:24.940 --> 12:27.023
what are you trying to tell her
by giving her jewelry?

12:27.521 --> 12:30.518
I don't know.
I guess... that I love her.

12:31.656 --> 12:32.717
What?

12:33.534 --> 12:35.522
Nothing,
that... that's terrific.

12:35.572 --> 12:38.852
Hey, just because you don't love
any girl doesn't mean I shouldn't.

12:38.946 --> 12:42.918
Excuse me, but I have loved many girls,
and many girls have loved me.

12:42.940 --> 12:45.333
That's not love, it's just sex.

12:46.357 --> 12:48.416
Sorry, I'm not following you.

12:49.512 --> 12:52.705
If you die tomorrow, how many of
those girls will come to your funeral?

12:52.733 --> 12:54.422
A lot of them.

12:54.600 --> 12:58.309
Granted a few might show up
just to make sure I'm really dead...

12:59.100 --> 13:01.870
But, I feel confident that the...

13:02.086 --> 13:06.130
overall tone of the event
would be, one of sadness.

13:07.224 --> 13:09.919
-If you say so.
-Yeah, I say so.

13:10.780 --> 13:12.329
Let's get out here.

13:12.339 --> 13:13.963
I haven't picked up a gift yet.

13:13.973 --> 13:16.405
Then, get her the stupid skull earrings.

13:16.406 --> 13:17.999
But you said she wouldn't like 'em.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.810
What do I know? Nobody loves me,
nobody's coming to my funeral.

13:22.402 --> 13:25.129
Wow... Where did that come from?

13:28.647 --> 13:32.112
Here, what about this
gold heart necklace?

13:33.589 --> 13:35.240
It's kinda expensive...

13:35.402 --> 13:37.786
You want the best Jake,
you got to pay for it.

13:37.815 --> 13:40.643
Yeah, but $39?

13:40.823 --> 13:43.076
I mean I love her and everything...

13:43.906 --> 13:44.948
I'll tell you what,

13:44.949 --> 13:47.953
if it means we can get out of here
quicker, I'll front you the difference.

13:48.009 --> 13:49.004
I don't know...

13:49.023 --> 13:51.500
What do you mean, you don't know?!
I'm offering you a great deal!

13:51.501 --> 13:55.547
Yeah, but you always say: "If it sounds
too good to be true, it probably is."

13:55.575 --> 13:58.157
Alright, how about if I pay
for the whole thing?

13:58.335 --> 14:00.551
That sounds even better, so no.

14:02.354 --> 14:04.100
Come on, Brainiac.

14:05.368 --> 14:07.377
What do I have to do for you?

14:07.687 --> 14:09.666
Just promise to be sad at my funeral.

14:09.759 --> 14:11.459
-Do I have to cry?
-No.

14:11.609 --> 14:13.546
Will there be food?

14:14.091 --> 14:15.950
-Yes.
-Can I bring a date?

14:18.396 --> 14:20.153
You're just screwing
with me now, right?

14:20.189 --> 14:21.936
How does it feel?

14:27.474 --> 14:29.441
Still early,
want to go shoot some hoops?

14:29.446 --> 14:31.569
Nah, I'm gonna go call Wendy Chow.

14:33.753 --> 14:36.216
Hey, bros before Chows!

14:40.480 --> 14:43.212
Thanks for the ride
to the mall, Uncle Charlie.

14:44.442 --> 14:46.941
Thanks for buying me
the necklace, Uncle Charlie.

14:47.423 --> 14:48.602
Thanks for not slugging me

14:48.603 --> 14:52.334
when I started mouthing off
about your funeral, Uncle Charlie.

15:23.126 --> 15:24.215
Chester!

15:27.200 --> 15:28.355
Easy boy.

15:28.393 --> 15:30.867
-Charlie, what did you do to him?
-What did I do to him?

15:30.923 --> 15:33.736
I practically crapped my pants,
is what I did to him.

15:33.746 --> 15:36.009
-What the hell is that?
-This is Chester!

15:36.096 --> 15:39.009
Isn't he cute?
Yes you are, yes you are...

15:39.012 --> 15:40.692
He's not staying here, Alan.

15:41.236 --> 15:44.448
Well, with all do respect,
that's what you said about me.

15:44.588 --> 15:47.700
That's because no kennel
in town would take you.

15:48.168 --> 15:51.596
Oh come on, look at him,
how could you not love this face?

15:51.708 --> 15:54.244
Easy, I know where he puts it.

15:54.814 --> 15:56.814
Now take him back to Kandi's.

15:56.842 --> 15:57.875
I can't.

15:57.894 --> 15:58.882
Why not?

15:58.891 --> 16:01.361
-It's kinda complicated.
-Then simplify it.

16:01.389 --> 16:04.869
OK, well hum...
I stole him.

16:07.658 --> 16:11.572
Oh Alan... I may think with my penis,
but at least I think!

16:12.100 --> 16:13.706
Don't worry,
you won't have to do anything,

16:13.707 --> 16:15.394
I'll feed him, I'll walk him...

16:15.437 --> 16:16.756
Walk him?

16:16.774 --> 16:20.216
You could hitch a wagon to him,
and settle the West!

16:20.799 --> 16:22.804
No dogs in my house.

16:22.855 --> 16:26.949
Especially stolen dogs who are
big enough to make me their bitch!

16:27.297 --> 16:29.654
Wow, what the hell is that?

16:30.325 --> 16:31.762
That, is leaving.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.677
Oh Charlie, please.
Of my entire life,

16:33.678 --> 16:38.459
Chester is the only living thing that I ever
slept with that didn't sue me for alimony.

16:38.533 --> 16:41.105
Alan, how long do you think
you're gonna get away with this?

16:41.124 --> 16:44.770
I was very careful. I left the door
open, so when Kandi comes home,

16:44.771 --> 16:47.287
she'll think she left it
open and let Chester run away.

16:47.288 --> 16:49.879
She will never dream of
looking for him here.

16:50.870 --> 16:51.894
Probably.

16:53.866 --> 16:56.122
Just in case, hide Chester.

16:57.220 --> 16:59.163
How am I supposed to hide him?

16:59.201 --> 17:02.816
Sit under him with a pail
and pretend he's a cow.

17:03.821 --> 17:05.971
Coming!
Please.

17:08.065 --> 17:10.008
Come on, Bullwinkle.

17:19.679 --> 17:21.491
Alan Harper?

17:21.548 --> 17:23.660
Yes. How can I help you?

17:24.111 --> 17:26.336
We're investigating
a stolen dog report.

17:26.688 --> 17:28.330
A dog?

17:28.557 --> 17:30.371
Your ex-wife's dog?

17:31.082 --> 17:33.717
Chester?
Somebody stole Chester?

17:34.938 --> 17:37.895
She seems to think
you might know his whereabouts.

17:38.506 --> 17:42.986
Oh gosh... I'm sorry,
I have no idea.

17:43.583 --> 17:46.202
Although, you know
what could have happened?

17:47.235 --> 17:50.828
She could have left the door opened,
she's absent-minded.

17:51.317 --> 17:53.279
And, huh... the dog got away.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.034
Hey.

18:16.133 --> 18:18.965
Oh, look who's finally off the phone.

18:18.969 --> 18:19.983
Yeah.

18:20.943 --> 18:22.933
So when are you gonna give
Wendy Chow the necklace?

18:23.243 --> 18:24.529
I'm not.

18:25.290 --> 18:27.262
What happened?
Chickened out?

18:27.468 --> 18:28.539
No.

18:29.957 --> 18:31.457
I don't believe it.

18:32.092 --> 18:34.303
You dragged my ass
all the way down to the mall,

18:34.304 --> 18:37.525
I pony up 40 bucks
for the necklace and you chicken out.

18:37.539 --> 18:39.955
She just dumped me, old turd!

18:43.436 --> 18:44.604
Oh... 

18:44.705 --> 18:47.451
You could have told me that
before I started being a turd...

18:48.204 --> 18:51.746
I'm only twelve...
I need a time machine.

18:53.398 --> 18:56.137
Oh dude,
I'm really sorry, what happened?

18:56.356 --> 18:59.683
She decided she has a problem
with mixed relationships.

19:02.159 --> 19:04.910
What, Chinese and Caucasian?

19:05.051 --> 19:06.937
Gifted and remedial.

19:08.759 --> 19:10.402
Oooh...

19:10.928 --> 19:14.615
Yeah well, I'm done with relationships.
From now on, I'm gonna be like you.

19:15.038 --> 19:16.749
Why would you want to be like me?

19:16.963 --> 19:19.976
'Cause you never fall in love
with anybody so you never get hurt.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.703
OK, listen to me.

19:26.058 --> 19:32.633
Being hurt sucks, but love is the most
beautiful and noble of human emotions.

19:32.659 --> 19:36.204
It's what gives a man hope,
it's what gives his life meaning.

19:36.690 --> 19:41.896
Don't turn your back on love, Jake.
I did, and I regret it everyday.

19:42.815 --> 19:43.848
Really?

19:43.960 --> 19:46.499
May god strike me down if I'm lying.

19:57.906 --> 20:00.756
Alright, game's over.
Let's go.

20:00.853 --> 20:02.182
Where are we going?

20:02.506 --> 20:05.087
Might as well bail your dad out of jail.

20:07.942 --> 20:11.000
-Can we get something to eat first?
-Sure, why not...

20:14.745 --> 20:18.041
How long before Kandi and her lawyer
come back from Mexico?

20:19.431 --> 20:21.065
3 more days.

20:22.943 --> 20:25.879
Oh God...
What are you feeding that dog?

20:25.899 --> 20:27.820
It's not the dog...

20:29.093 --> 20:32.198
It smells a little like... banana bread.
