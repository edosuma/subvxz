WEBVTT

00:15.740 --> 00:17.953
- Sorry, Mike.
- You gotta fight back, baby.

00:17.953 --> 00:19.413
Fight back!
Settle down.

00:19.413 --> 00:21.877
I know, he's a bum, champ.

00:21.877 --> 00:23.421
<i>No fighter
in the history of boxing</i>

00:23.421 --> 00:25.885
<i>ever got back on top
after three years away.</i>

00:25.885 --> 00:28.724
<i>What made everyone think
that I'd be the one?</i>

00:28.724 --> 00:31.855
<i>"He must be an animal.
Mike the fucking cannibal."</i>

00:31.855 --> 00:33.943
<i>I know this is
what you're here for, right?</i>

00:33.943 --> 00:36.072
<i>The ear bite heard
'round the world.</i>

00:36.072 --> 00:37.534
<i>So why'd I do it?</i>

00:37.534 --> 00:39.453
<i>What was going through
my fucking head?</i>

00:41.834 --> 00:43.420
<i>My first press conference
after prison,</i>

00:43.420 --> 00:46.510
<i>I was fucking terrified
to face you.</i>

00:46.510 --> 00:49.223
Good afternoon.

00:49.223 --> 00:52.229
I'd like to make a st--um.

00:52.229 --> 00:54.233
Uh, excuse me.

00:54.233 --> 00:58.199
I'd like to make a statement
about my future.

00:58.199 --> 01:01.247
There's been a lot
of speculation about my plans.

01:01.247 --> 01:03.168
Here they are.

01:03.168 --> 01:04.755
I will fight again.

01:04.755 --> 01:07.384
I look forward
to seeing you all very soon.

01:07.384 --> 01:09.138
May Allah bless you all.

01:10.516 --> 01:11.935
How does it feel
to be a free man, Mike?

01:11.935 --> 01:13.271
Mike!
Over here, Mike.

01:13.271 --> 01:15.526
How does it feel
to be out of prison?

01:15.526 --> 01:18.114
Mike! Mike!

01:18.114 --> 01:19.701
Listen, Mike.

01:19.701 --> 01:21.162
If you want to delay this,

01:21.162 --> 01:24.168
take some time for yourself,
you can.

01:24.168 --> 01:26.047
You are in charge.

01:26.047 --> 01:29.470
Not Don. Not the press. Not me.

01:31.349 --> 01:32.434
You are.

01:32.434 --> 01:33.896
<i>Monica Turner.</i>

01:33.896 --> 01:36.317
<i>She was a beautiful woman
inside and out.</i>

01:36.317 --> 01:37.987
<i>You didn't wanna fuck
with her.</i>

01:37.987 --> 01:40.033
<i>She was a tough cookie.
Always was.</i>

01:40.033 --> 01:41.662
<i>From the first time I met her.</i>

01:41.662 --> 01:44.166
Mm. The data is clear.

01:44.166 --> 01:47.381
You have to acknowledge
this is a legitimate crisis.

01:47.381 --> 01:49.886
Urban kids are
severely undereducated,

01:49.886 --> 01:52.307
which perpetuates the cycle.

01:52.307 --> 01:53.853
You know?

01:53.853 --> 01:56.357
Well, in my experience...

01:56.357 --> 01:58.361
the education system
would rather incarcerate

01:58.361 --> 02:00.282
than educate young Black kids.

02:00.282 --> 02:02.954
At least you got out.

02:02.954 --> 02:06.377
Not everyone can become
world champion at 22.

02:08.089 --> 02:10.302
20.

02:10.302 --> 02:11.722
The youngest ever.

02:13.099 --> 02:15.103
You know, I, um...

02:15.103 --> 02:16.940
I like the way you think.

02:16.940 --> 02:18.569
We should get outta here.

02:18.569 --> 02:20.447
Talk in private.

02:20.447 --> 02:23.244
As flattering as that sounds,

02:23.244 --> 02:26.042
I'm not the type
to throw themselves at boxers.

02:26.042 --> 02:27.461
Then what type are you?

02:27.461 --> 02:29.800
♪ I'm gonna get me
another woman ♪

02:29.800 --> 02:33.181
I'm the type that only cares
about becoming a doctor.

02:33.181 --> 02:35.352
♪ Oh, no love ♪

02:35.352 --> 02:37.356
Nothing else.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.698
<i>Oh, she saw
right through all my bullshit.</i>

02:43.536 --> 02:45.121
I liked her already.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.125
<i>Took a little longer
to get her to like me, though.</i>

02:47.125 --> 02:49.548
<i>We kept in touch.</i>

02:51.927 --> 02:53.346
Mike?

02:57.647 --> 02:58.983
What are you doing?

02:58.983 --> 03:00.443
Got your letter.

03:00.443 --> 03:01.530
Nice photo.

03:03.199 --> 03:04.703
I wasn't sure if--

03:04.703 --> 03:06.289
I didn't hear back,
so I thought--

03:06.289 --> 03:07.792
I'm calling now.

03:07.792 --> 03:11.340
Well, so how are you
doing with everything?

03:11.340 --> 03:14.138
<i>You know, I've been reading up
about the upcoming trial.</i>

03:14.138 --> 03:16.727
I don't know how you keep
that smile on your face.

03:18.021 --> 03:20.025
It's all I got.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.528
They don't care
whether I did it or not.

03:21.528 --> 03:23.657
They just want to lock me up
and throw away the key.

03:23.657 --> 03:27.915
Yeah, the system has a way
of doing that to Black men.

03:27.915 --> 03:29.335
<i>Is there anything I can do?</i>

03:29.335 --> 03:31.757
You can open up and let me
inside so we can hang out.

03:32.884 --> 03:36.850
Mike, no. I am studying.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.937
Can I have a kiss at least?

03:42.570 --> 03:45.618
♪ Oh, bye ♪

03:45.618 --> 03:49.041
♪ Bye, bye ♪

03:49.041 --> 03:51.295
Just one.

03:51.295 --> 03:52.840
No tongue.

03:54.636 --> 03:57.600
♪ Oh, bye ♪

03:57.600 --> 03:59.521
<i>It was just one kiss.</i>

03:59.521 --> 04:01.733
<i>But I shit you not,
after that, she visited me,</i>

04:01.733 --> 04:03.612
<i>like, every two weeks
while I was in jail.</i>

04:03.612 --> 04:06.075
<i>So yeah, we fell in love.
She was my tigress.</i>

04:06.075 --> 04:08.622
You think tigers get depressed?

04:08.622 --> 04:10.375
I do.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.172
Especially ones
that are locked up in a cage.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.182
I feel like a tiger.

04:19.936 --> 04:21.105
I know.

04:22.817 --> 04:25.740
And we both know
who's making you feel that way.

04:25.740 --> 04:29.079
But what do you want, Mike?

04:29.079 --> 04:31.292
Hmm?

04:31.292 --> 04:33.463
I just wanna have the peace
I had when I was inside.

04:36.385 --> 04:38.724
You said you wanted
to fire Don.

04:40.143 --> 04:41.187
Yeah.

04:41.187 --> 04:44.193
He doesn't give
a damn about you.

04:44.193 --> 04:47.617
The only way he stays up
is by keeping you down.

04:49.913 --> 04:51.917
He's using you, Mike.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.629
And he's always gonna use you.

04:56.467 --> 04:59.014
<i>In prison,
I became a new man.</i>

04:59.014 --> 05:00.893
<i>But Don was still
the slimy fuck</i>

05:00.893 --> 05:02.270
<i>he'd always been.</i>

05:02.270 --> 05:04.108
Iron Mike, the man.

05:04.108 --> 05:05.945
We got over 200 journalists
coming in tomorrow

05:05.945 --> 05:07.322
from all over the world.

05:07.322 --> 05:10.495
I'm not doing the fucking
press conference, Don.

05:10.495 --> 05:12.583
Okay, no problem.
We can reschedule.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.253
No, I'm done with you.

05:14.253 --> 05:15.714
We're fucking done.

05:15.714 --> 05:17.092
Mike, you can't just
come in here

05:17.092 --> 05:18.929
and drop something like that
without talking about it.

05:18.929 --> 05:20.975
We got contracts.

05:20.975 --> 05:22.603
Don't do to me what
these white devils do to me

05:22.603 --> 05:24.022
all the time, Mike.

05:24.022 --> 05:25.358
We on the same side.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.947
You're on your own
fucking side, Don.

05:27.947 --> 05:29.324
Okay.

05:30.953 --> 05:32.707
You the boss,
you can fire me now.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.376
- Yeah.
- Or...

05:38.259 --> 05:40.931
You can take these two
briefcases with you,

05:40.931 --> 05:42.727
and we'll just call it a day.

05:44.898 --> 05:46.150
You could just say
it's an advance

05:46.150 --> 05:47.277
on the McNeeley fight.

05:50.116 --> 05:52.120
<i>Don knew I thought
I was a piece of shit.</i>

05:52.120 --> 05:54.124
<i>Money said
I was worth something.</i>

05:54.124 --> 05:57.047
<i>Fuck it.</i>
It's $2 million.

05:57.047 --> 05:59.426
It's stupendously staggering.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.055
Three billion people--

06:01.055 --> 06:04.520
India, Indonesia,
the Soviet Union,

06:04.520 --> 06:06.398
Ireland,
all the little leprechauns

06:06.398 --> 06:07.777
dancing in the field--

06:07.777 --> 06:10.574
are all here
to witness Mike Tyson

06:10.574 --> 06:13.287
and his return
after three years

06:13.287 --> 06:15.834
against
Hurricane Peter McNeeley.

06:15.834 --> 06:19.216
There he is,
our future, our future.

06:19.216 --> 06:20.594
Iron Mike Tyson.

06:21.596 --> 06:23.934
Iron Mike Tyson.

06:23.934 --> 06:25.854
The true champion,
after three years,

06:25.854 --> 06:27.440
ready to take on the world.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.986
He ain't playing no games.

06:30.196 --> 06:32.200
<i>The problem was,
I was ready to take the money,</i>

06:32.200 --> 06:35.833
<i>but I sure as shit wasn't
ready for the first fight.</i>

06:35.833 --> 06:37.085
My timing was shit.

06:37.085 --> 06:39.381
I was off-balance
and paranoid as fuck.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.308
Stop. Come on, champ.

06:44.308 --> 06:46.813
You're better than this.
Let's go. Reset.

06:46.813 --> 06:49.109
Mike look like he's still
on that fucking Lithium.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.571
Here we go, champ!

06:50.571 --> 06:52.490
<i>I needed help,
and I needed it fast.</i>

06:52.490 --> 06:54.537
What is this?

06:54.537 --> 06:55.748
A funeral?

06:55.748 --> 06:56.958
Wake the fuck...

06:56.958 --> 06:58.754
<i>
Steven "Crocodile" Finch.</i>

06:58.754 --> 07:00.507
<i>He was my spark.</i>
- Up!

07:00.507 --> 07:01.634
You don't fall asleep

07:01.634 --> 07:03.054
when the Crocodile around, baby,

07:03.054 --> 07:05.768
because I'ma bite all day long!

07:05.768 --> 07:07.103
Mike, you an icon...

07:07.103 --> 07:08.982
<i>See, now,
that's a fucking hype man.</i>

07:08.982 --> 07:10.276
<i>I needed someone
from the street</i>

07:10.276 --> 07:12.740
<i>to remind me who I am--
who I was.</i>

07:12.740 --> 07:14.451
Let me see it!

07:14.451 --> 07:16.371
Icon and a phenom!

07:19.419 --> 07:22.258
Loved by few, hated by many,

07:22.258 --> 07:24.597
but respected by all!

07:27.603 --> 07:29.524
Time to put on a show!

07:29.524 --> 07:30.859
<i>It was my first fight
out of prison,</i>

07:30.859 --> 07:33.657
<i>and my heart was beating
out of my chest.</i>

07:33.657 --> 07:34.909
<i>I used to knock
these fucks out</i>

07:34.909 --> 07:36.871
<i>in ten seconds.</i>

07:36.871 --> 07:38.374
<i>I was invincible.</i>

07:38.374 --> 07:40.086
<i>I was a monster.</i>

07:40.086 --> 07:43.217
<i>But now, I just didn't know...</i>

07:43.217 --> 07:44.595
<i>until I saw his face.</i>

07:44.595 --> 07:46.223
<i>He couldn't even look at me.</i>

07:46.223 --> 07:47.768
I knew I had him.

07:49.772 --> 07:51.024
<i>
They threw in the towel!</i>

07:51.024 --> 07:52.695
You're back, baby!
You're back!

07:52.695 --> 07:54.615
<i>It's all over
in the first round!</i>

07:54.615 --> 07:56.953
But I wasn't back.
Not yet.

07:59.291 --> 08:00.586
Y'all wasn't gonna let me
feel like me

08:00.586 --> 08:02.548
till I got that title back.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.176
Mike, Mike,
after paying top dollar,

08:04.176 --> 08:05.846
people were disappointed
when the McNeely fight

08:05.846 --> 08:07.683
didn't last
past the opening bell.

08:12.233 --> 08:13.653
I let you hit
the third round this time.

08:13.653 --> 08:15.741
You happy?

08:15.741 --> 08:18.454
I was winning, making money.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.291
I was trying
to let Monica love me,

08:20.291 --> 08:22.420
and I was trying
to let myself love her.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.007
Aww.

08:24.007 --> 08:26.386
Monica and I had
this beautiful baby girl,

08:26.386 --> 08:28.057
Rayna Tyson.

08:30.311 --> 08:31.522
I already had my firstborn,

08:31.522 --> 08:34.194
Mikey Lorna,
with a woman from New York.

08:34.194 --> 08:36.532
They used to visit me
in prison.

08:36.532 --> 08:40.081
But now I had a chance to be a
more present father for Rayna.

08:40.081 --> 08:42.753
I wanted to be a hero
for both of my girls.

08:42.753 --> 08:45.216
I told myself I had
to keep winning no matter what.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.628
I got the WBC belt back.

09:03.628 --> 09:04.922
Check.

09:09.974 --> 09:12.020
I won
the WBA Heavyweight title.

09:12.020 --> 09:13.898
Check.

09:13.898 --> 09:17.113
<i>I won two belts
and earned $80 million.</i>

09:17.113 --> 09:18.867
<i>I was world champion again</i>

09:18.867 --> 09:21.581
<i>in a house with a moat
next to Wayne Newton</i>

09:21.581 --> 09:23.500
<i>and a fucking tiger.</i>

09:23.500 --> 09:25.881
<i>But all those goodies
didn't do shit.</i>

09:25.881 --> 09:28.052
<i>'Cause I hated Mike Tyson,
and I kept telling myself</i>

09:28.052 --> 09:29.387
<i>I didn't give a fuck.</i>

09:29.387 --> 09:30.849
But I do.

09:30.849 --> 09:33.020
Jesus, the fuck
is wrong with me?

09:34.565 --> 09:37.863
<i>I had a future, but I didn't
think I deserved it.</i>

09:37.863 --> 09:39.742
<i>I didn't deserve a mansion.</i>

09:39.742 --> 09:42.246
<i>I should've been getting ready
for my first Holyfield fight,</i>

09:42.246 --> 09:44.250
<i>getting ready to destroy him.</i>

09:44.250 --> 09:48.175
<i>Instead, I wanted to blow
all this shit up.</i>

09:48.175 --> 09:49.469
Give me the bag.

I think I started off good,

I kinda blacked out.

11:39.188 --> 11:40.525

They cheated us.

12:42.733 --> 12:45.404
Calm down, Mike.
There's nobody there.

12:45.404 --> 12:47.491
Jesus!

12:47.491 --> 12:50.164
You have got to stop
with the drugs

12:50.164 --> 12:52.084
and the partying, Mike.
You're fucking losing it.

12:53.378 --> 12:55.967
Nobody is trying to stab you,

12:55.967 --> 12:58.765

13:00.142 --> 13:02.229
Oh, shit.

13:02.229 --> 13:04.358

13:04.358 --> 13:06.321

13:27.363 --> 13:29.075
Are you okay?

13:29.075 --> 13:31.622
Oh, I sincerely doubt it.

13:40.723 --> 13:42.434
I'm pregnant.

13:43.604 --> 13:44.606
Yeah?

13:51.286 --> 13:55.545
It's hard enough
having to navigate work

13:55.545 --> 13:57.172
and try to be a good parent.

13:59.051 --> 14:01.389
But now we're gonna have
another one.

14:01.389 --> 14:03.811
Let's get hitched.

14:03.811 --> 14:05.272
- What?
- Let's get hitched.

14:05.272 --> 14:08.153
No.
No. You're missing the point.

14:08.153 --> 14:09.405
We're having
two babies together--

14:09.405 --> 14:11.326
I didn't tell you this
so you'd marry me.

14:11.326 --> 14:12.787
I'll make an honest woman
out of you.

14:12.787 --> 14:15.000
I don't need you
to make me honest.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.089
I need you to be
more present in our lives.

14:19.801 --> 14:22.348
C'mon, baby. I love you.

14:23.726 --> 14:25.145
I love you.

14:31.825 --> 14:34.998
If I say yes...

14:34.998 --> 14:36.543
will you commit to us?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.088
- Yeah.
- To me?

14:38.088 --> 14:39.173
Yeah.

14:39.173 --> 14:42.262
Really commit.

14:42.262 --> 14:44.475
Marry me.

14:44.475 --> 14:45.895
Please.

14:53.536 --> 14:54.997
Before Allah,

14:54.997 --> 14:57.794
are you ready to pledge
yourselves to one another?

14:57.794 --> 14:59.673
Inshallah.

14:59.673 --> 15:01.719
In accordance with
Islamic law and Allah's will,

15:01.719 --> 15:03.597
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

15:05.893 --> 15:07.731
<i>So she got to marry me.</i>

15:10.611 --> 15:12.322
<i>And my demons.</i>

15:16.790 --> 15:18.586
<i>Speaking of demons,</i>

15:18.586 --> 15:20.506
<i>he was the one vice
I couldn't quit.</i>

15:20.506 --> 15:22.719
Congratulations on a soaring,

15:22.719 --> 15:25.140
spectacular achievement
of love.

15:26.894 --> 15:29.941
I hope it goes the distance.
- Me too.

15:32.822 --> 15:34.910
I just wanted to let you know

15:34.910 --> 15:36.747
that the deal closed.

15:36.747 --> 15:39.376
Holyfield verse Tyson II.

15:42.049 --> 15:44.095
I thought you wanted
to do this right away?

15:44.095 --> 15:45.807
I thought we agreed
to take some time off,

15:45.807 --> 15:47.769
see how things shake out.
- Mike, this isn't just a fight

15:47.769 --> 15:49.313
for some belt.

15:49.313 --> 15:52.654
This is a must-win
for your legacy.

15:52.654 --> 15:54.323
You never had a chance
to meet a fighter

15:54.323 --> 15:56.537
for the second time
that beat you.

15:56.537 --> 15:58.081
Douglas turned out
to be a joke,

15:58.081 --> 16:00.753
and Holyfield headbutted you
till you blacked out.

16:01.797 --> 16:03.801
You want history
to remember you that way?

16:05.220 --> 16:08.184
You're getting up in age.

16:08.184 --> 16:11.440
And the spotlight at some point
goes dark on everyone.

16:13.153 --> 16:14.865
I want what's best for you.

16:16.577 --> 16:20.125
You got a new,
beautiful wife and kids.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.920
Beat Holyfield.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.551
This is a $30 million
guaranteed payday.

16:27.306 --> 16:29.519
I don't know how many of those
you got left.

16:31.230 --> 16:34.571
Go out Heavyweight Champion
of the World, son.

16:36.365 --> 16:38.621
Otherwise, what are you?

16:44.633 --> 16:47.012
<i>
I had two fucking months.</i>

16:47.012 --> 16:49.433
<i>I had just gotten clean.</i>

16:49.433 --> 16:51.647
<i>I had the shakes.</i>

16:51.647 --> 16:54.276
<i>I was out of shape.</i>

16:54.276 --> 16:56.657
<i>But fuck...</i>

16:56.657 --> 16:58.827
<i>it was $30 million.</i>

17:06.092 --> 17:09.098
<i>So here it is.
What you paid your money for.</i>

17:09.098 --> 17:11.770
<i>97 countries tuned in
to watch the fight.</i>

17:11.770 --> 17:13.899
<i>I didn't even know
there were 97 countries.</i>

17:13.899 --> 17:18.241
<i>18,000 people in the stands.
Millions paid to watch it.</i>

17:18.241 --> 17:19.661
<i>
The waiting is over.</i>

17:19.661 --> 17:22.875
<i>The talking is done.
The rematch is here.</i>

17:25.088 --> 17:27.050
<i>Look at the look
on Tyson's face</i>

17:27.050 --> 17:29.556
<i>as he goes eye to eye
with Holyfield.</i>

17:29.556 --> 17:32.603
<i>The sense of anticipation
as before the first fight</i>

17:32.603 --> 17:34.398
<i>is almost palpable.</i>

17:34.398 --> 17:36.695
<i>
Don said this is my legacy,</i>

17:36.695 --> 17:39.743
<i>and I was not about to let
this fucker take it from me.</i>

17:39.743 --> 17:41.245
It's now or never.

17:41.245 --> 17:42.414
<i>Here we go!</i>

17:42.414 --> 17:44.878
<i>Fight two, round one.</i>

17:44.878 --> 17:48.176
<i>A ferocious Mike Tyson
bobbing and weaving.</i>

17:50.931 --> 17:53.061
<i>That motherfucker
headbutted me.</i>

17:53.061 --> 17:55.190
<i>What a first round.</i>

17:55.190 --> 17:57.277
<i>
And he fucking did it again.</i>

17:57.277 --> 17:59.239
<i>
Looks over to the referee.</i>

17:59.239 --> 18:01.995
<i>That's a cut around
the right eye of Mike Tyson</i>

18:01.995 --> 18:03.456
<i>from a clash of hands,
I believe.</i>

18:03.456 --> 18:05.210
That's a time out.
That's a butt.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.963
- What the fuck?
- It's a butt.

18:06.963 --> 18:08.550
<i>There was no way I was
gonna let this motherfucker</i>

18:08.550 --> 18:09.803
<i>take me out like that again.</i>

18:09.803 --> 18:12.182
I wasn't gonna lose.
He wants to fight dirty?

18:12.182 --> 18:13.560
Then we're gonna fight
fucking dirty.

18:15.940 --> 18:18.361
<i>There it is again. Motherfucker.</i>

18:24.916 --> 18:28.047
<i>Tyson is biting
Holyfield in the ear!</i>

18:28.047 --> 18:30.970
<i>Oh, my goodness!
He's got a bloody right ear.</i>

18:30.970 --> 18:32.765
<i>Holyfield, look out!</i>

18:32.765 --> 18:34.769
<i>He's pushed right here
above us.</i>

18:34.769 --> 18:36.940
<i>Mike Tyson.</i>

18:36.940 --> 18:39.696
<i>Listen.
They're yelling, "Tyson."</i>

18:39.696 --> 18:41.616
You bit his ear.
- He butted!

18:41.616 --> 18:44.622
Bullshit.
I'm taking two points.

18:44.622 --> 18:46.208
<i>Listen.</i>

18:46.208 --> 18:49.173
<i>Holyfield bit
by a dirty Mike Tyson.</i>

18:54.141 --> 18:55.393
<i>In that moment,
I believed he was</i>

18:55.393 --> 18:57.105
<i>headbutting me on purpose.</i>

18:57.105 --> 19:00.571
<i>In the first fight, the refs
called headbutting accidental.</i>

19:02.783 --> 19:06.290
<i>Bull-fucking-shit.</i>

19:06.290 --> 19:08.127
Can you walk us
through your mindset?

19:08.127 --> 19:09.672
Listen, he butted me
in the first round,

19:09.672 --> 19:11.050
and he butted me
in the second round.

19:11.050 --> 19:13.137
No one warned him.
No one took any points away.

19:13.137 --> 19:14.682
This is my career.
What am I supposed to do?

19:14.682 --> 19:15.851
I got kids to raise.

19:15.851 --> 19:17.395
He butted me,
I had to retaliate.

19:17.395 --> 19:19.274
When you bit him, was that
a retaliation for the eye?

19:19.274 --> 19:20.318
Regardless of what I did,

19:20.318 --> 19:21.530
he was butting me
for two fights.

19:21.530 --> 19:22.907
But you gotta
address it, Mike.

19:22.907 --> 19:24.577
I did address it!
I addressed it in the ring.

19:24.577 --> 19:25.704
Why'd you do that, though,
Mike?

19:25.704 --> 19:26.998
Look at me. I got one eye.

19:26.998 --> 19:29.671
He got two ears. Look at me.
How am I--

19:29.671 --> 19:30.756
What are you gonna do now

19:30.756 --> 19:33.135
in terms of your career, Mike?

19:33.135 --> 19:34.556
The thing I was
worried about most

19:34.556 --> 19:37.102
was that my kids were gonna be
scared of me.

19:43.991 --> 19:45.619
I don't know why I did that.

19:45.619 --> 19:47.582
You probably think
I'm a monster.

19:51.548 --> 19:52.800
No.

20:00.189 --> 20:02.110
Do you want to tell me
what happened?

20:04.824 --> 20:06.452
I'm a mess, baby.

20:11.170 --> 20:14.134
I don't know why I do
the things I do.

20:14.134 --> 20:16.013
Even with you.

20:16.013 --> 20:17.516
I hurt you,
and I know I'm doing it,

20:17.516 --> 20:18.894
and I still do it.

20:23.152 --> 20:25.281
I know.

20:27.954 --> 20:29.916
I love you,

20:29.916 --> 20:31.544
but I know.

20:37.263 --> 20:39.519
<i>
Monica really did love me,</i>

20:39.519 --> 20:42.357
<i>but I felt like
I didn't deserve her love,</i>

20:42.357 --> 20:45.321
<i>so I pushed her away.</i>

20:45.321 --> 20:46.700
<i>All this time,
I convinced myself</i>

20:46.700 --> 20:48.411
<i>that everyone was
out to hurt me.</i>

20:48.411 --> 20:51.668
But that's not what
I should've been worried about.

20:51.668 --> 20:55.007
I didn't know how to change it.
So why did I do it?

20:55.007 --> 20:57.137
<i>Maybe that's who I really am.</i>

20:57.137 --> 20:59.349
<i>I was just showing
the worst side of me.</i>

20:59.349 --> 21:02.188
<i>Maybe I was reacting to what
Holyfield was doing to me.</i>

21:02.188 --> 21:04.443
<i>Maybe I was
just putting on a show.</i>

21:04.443 --> 21:06.030
<i>Or maybe I was just trying
to kill that demon</i>

21:06.030 --> 21:07.490
<i>once and for all.</i>

21:07.490 --> 21:08.744
<i>Maybe I was just trying
to fix it</i>

21:08.744 --> 21:10.581
<i>so Mike Tyson would disappear.</i>

21:10.581 --> 21:14.421
<i>'Cause the truth is, by 2003,
I hated Mike Tyson so much...</i>

21:14.421 --> 21:16.634
I didn't want to see
his fucking face no more.
