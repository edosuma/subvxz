keep him away from

But do we include
the girls?

Kelly's in way over
her head already.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.066
I'm back.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.981
Kelly: I think we just found
where Chuck's been hiding.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.939
It means he knows how
to do magic.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.419

Chuck has our recipes.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.431
[sighs]
I don't get it.

00:40.518 --> 00:44.261
He's got
every recipe we've made
in the past few days.

that we haven't cooked.

I cooked these before.

What?
When?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.452
You were cooking
without us?

01:01.539 --> 01:03.193
Only small stuff,
like when my dad

01:03.280 --> 01:04.542
needed help
finding his keys

01:04.629 --> 01:06.066
so he wouldn't be
late for work.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.503
Anyway, practice
makes us better cooks.

this whole creepy vintage

Leave it.
We have to go.

Last week he didn't know
what an emoji was,

02:06.300 --> 02:10.042
this week he has
his own cookbook that's
stealing our spells?

why Grandma's been so scared.

We've never tried a spell

What other choice
do we have?

I mean,
he's stealing our magic.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.130
And who knows
what he'll do next.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.176
Maybe we should
talk to the OCs.

02:56.263 --> 02:59.831
No! After Grandma's whole
"let's not tell the girls"
speech,

02:59.918 --> 03:01.485
I'm not too eager
to clue her in.

03:01.572 --> 03:03.661
I agree with you there,
I just think that we should

03:03.748 --> 03:05.185
take a second,
slow down,

03:05.272 --> 03:06.795

think about this.

Um... yes.

I mean, no.

Please don't make me
the tie breaker.

We're the protectors
of the book.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.895
So let's protect it.

It's hard to argue
with that.

was automatically pulled
from this book to Chuck's book.

take away his ability

Mussels?
For breakfast?

unique choice.

It's always good to

quite that well.

make sense.

One is for class credit,

the students there
were so into music.

more academic.

were up to scale,

No need.
Just go.

21:48.219 --> 21:51.005
Uh, get yourselves
to safety.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.528
Jake: What if he
comes too soon?

21:52.615 --> 21:54.661
Better me than you.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.140
Thanks, Mama P.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.795
We couldn't have done this
without you.

21:58.882 --> 22:01.276
Just save the cookbook.
I'll handle the rest.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.133
[clattering]

22:33.743 --> 22:34.875
Kelly: Darbie's blueprints
saved me.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.355
They were
totally perfect.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.921
Uh, well, you totally
hulked out on that book.

22:38.008 --> 22:39.096
So awesome.

22:39.183 --> 22:40.881
Yeah, and when
the door locked, I--

22:40.968 --> 22:42.404
- Oh, my gosh,
you freaked out.
- I know.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.972
That sounds so cool.

22:45.059 --> 22:46.408
I wish I could have
been there to help.

22:46.495 --> 22:48.410
No worries.
The two of us got
the job done.

22:48.497 --> 22:49.846
Mm-hm.

22:49.933 --> 22:51.892
[giggles]

22:51.979 --> 22:55.156
So, how was the meeting
with your mentor?

22:55.243 --> 22:57.463
Uh, it was okay.
Nothing special.

22:57.550 --> 22:58.986
Still excited for
Fox Canyon?

22:59.073 --> 23:00.553
I guess.
I don't know.

23:02.119 --> 23:03.817
I could have
stalled Chuck, you know.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.079
I was there.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.560
It's okay.
You were busy.

23:07.647 --> 23:10.214
Besides,
it doesn't matter now.

23:10.301 --> 23:11.520
Grandma handled it.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.827
Speaking of Grandma Q,

23:13.914 --> 23:16.046
we should prepare for
a lecture from the OCs.

23:16.133 --> 23:19.180
They weren't too happy
we went to Chuck's alone.

23:19.267 --> 23:21.400
[rustling]

23:21.487 --> 23:23.619
So now what?
We have Chuck's book,

23:23.706 --> 23:25.142
but we haven't
stopped the leak.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.362
[sighs]
Darbie, any ideas?

23:27.449 --> 23:29.190
Sadly,
the spell wore off.

23:29.277 --> 23:32.411
I'm back to
indecisive Darbie.

23:32.498 --> 23:35.152
It's not like the spell
gave you the ideas.

23:35.239 --> 23:38.112
It just made you
believe in yourself.

23:38.199 --> 23:40.114
You should take the lead
more often.

23:40.201 --> 23:42.682
You saved the day today.

23:42.769 --> 23:44.031
Congrats, Darbie.

23:44.118 --> 23:45.424
Thanks.
I'll work on that.

23:45.511 --> 23:46.990
But first,
I'm hungry.

23:47.077 --> 23:48.383
Should I have an apple
or a banana?

23:48.470 --> 23:49.776
[giggling]

23:49.863 --> 23:51.386
Oh. I almost forgot.

23:53.170 --> 23:54.345
I found this in
Chuck's trailer.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.655
Chuck has
excellent penmanship.

24:02.919 --> 24:05.531
It looks like
a shopping list of spices.

24:05.618 --> 24:08.098
It's like he's
trying to create
a recipe or something.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.622
The list seems so random.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.406
I don't know.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.147
But I'm not getting
a good feeling about it.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.847

24:21.198 --> 24:22.373

24:22.461 --> 24:24.375
