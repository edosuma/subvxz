WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:04.970
This is all Aunt Pat left you?
A box of junk?

00:04.972 --> 00:06.338
This isn't junk.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.775
These are things that belonged
to your great-great-grandfather.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.411
Looks like a box of old tools.

00:12.413 --> 00:15.014
It's turn-of-the-century
mining equipment.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.983
Old, obsolete tools.

00:17.985 --> 00:21.720
Just think, Lynn.
Someday all this will be yours.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.523
Pass.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.826
Come on. This is part
of our ancestral heritage.

00:27.828 --> 00:31.497
You can't put a dollar value
on something like that.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.799
I can. Two bucks.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.536
My great-grandfather,
Silas Tanner

00:37.538 --> 00:39.738
was a pioneer,
he was an adventurer.

00:39.740 --> 00:44.009
The last four years of his life,
he prospected for gold.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.779
Doesn't look like he was
very good at it.

00:46.781 --> 00:50.115
You know, my great-uncle
Louie Louie was a prospector.

00:50.117 --> 00:54.586
He started the Great Foam Rush
of aught eight.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.688
- Foam?
- Yeah.

00:56.690 --> 01:00.392
Our whole monetary system
was based on the foam standard.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.796
Louie Louie became very stupid.

01:03.798 --> 01:06.432
So it runs in the family.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.600
Oh, ha, ha.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.136
For your information,
on Melmac

01:11.138 --> 01:15.407
"stupid" was slang
for someone who was rich.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.142
I guess we'll never know
how stupid

01:17.144 --> 01:18.844
my great-grandfather was.

01:18.846 --> 01:23.949
He died in 1897, and this is all
I have left of his legacy.

01:23.951 --> 01:26.485
Look what I found
in the canteen.

01:26.487 --> 01:30.022
What? Look. It's a map.

01:30.024 --> 01:31.757
Uh.. There's an X on it.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.093
[gasps]
It's a treasure map.

01:35.863 --> 01:38.997
Gadzooks!
We're going to be stupid.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.835
[theme music]

02:42.163 --> 02:44.796
[instrumental music]

02:47.268 --> 02:48.901
Well, according to this
old claim record

02:48.903 --> 02:52.271
this must be a map
of Waucoba Canyon

02:52.273 --> 02:54.573
that's in Death Valley.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.442
Well, that must be
where the treasure is.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.845
What makes you so sure
there's a treasure?

02:59.847 --> 03:04.349
The X on the map.
That always means treasure.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.919
Don't you watch cartoons?

03:06.921 --> 03:10.322
Life doesn't imitate cartoons.

03:10.324 --> 03:13.759
Well, other people's
lives don't.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.194
But Kate, Lynn, look at this.

03:15.196 --> 03:18.096
Silas has pinpointed
an exact location.

03:18.098 --> 03:20.299
These are very
detailed directions

03:20.301 --> 03:23.202
on how to get to a
very specific spot.

03:25.139 --> 03:27.172
Willie, I think you're making
a little bit too much

03:27.174 --> 03:29.007
out of this map.

03:29.009 --> 03:32.878
Alright. Count her out.
We'll divide the gold four ways.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.846
Unless we can get rid
of the kid.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.716
You're not getting rid
of any kid

03:37.718 --> 03:39.384
and there is no gold.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.987
I don't think we should rule
that out entirely.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.323
A-about the gold, I mean.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.558
We gotta do this, Willie.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.227
Now, I'll have to check my
calendar

03:48.229 --> 03:50.829
but I'm pretty sure
I'm free next weekend.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.800
Wait, wait, wait.
That's a three-day weekend.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.735
We were supposed to go
to San Diego.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.671
Okay. She's out too.
It's down to three.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.040
Unless we can still get
rid of the kid.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.377
What do you say?

04:05.379 --> 04:08.413
The desert, it would be
a refreshing change of pace.

04:08.415 --> 04:12.985
We've been to San Diego Zoo.
We've been to SeaWorld.

04:12.987 --> 04:15.988
Yeah. We've seen the killer
whales three times

04:15.990 --> 04:18.657
and they still haven't
killed anyone.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.125
What a gyp.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.028
What do you think, Kate?

04:23.030 --> 04:26.798
Why would Silas go back to the
desert year after year

04:26.800 --> 04:29.268
unless he had found something
valuable out there?

04:29.270 --> 04:31.770
Well, if he did find
something valuable

04:31.772 --> 04:34.039
why was he buried
in a piano crate?

04:34.041 --> 04:37.709
Maybe he was fat.
Did you ever think of that?

04:38.512 --> 04:40.112
I can't help it. I just--

04:40.114 --> 04:42.514
It's like
I hear his spirit calling me

04:42.516 --> 04:47.352
"Willie, go get it. Gold.
Give my life some worth."

04:48.422 --> 04:50.088
Okay, Willie.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.924
And-and with the money,
we'll buy a farm

04:52.926 --> 04:56.628
and we'll build a baseball
diamond in our field of corn.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.864
And maybe Shoeless Joe Jackson--

04:58.866 --> 05:00.999
Alright. Alright.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.402
But, look, wouldn't it be
educational for the kids?

05:03.404 --> 05:06.505
Wouldn't it be getting in touch
with our ancestral roots?

05:06.507 --> 05:08.440
What about it, kids?

05:08.442 --> 05:09.808
I don't know, Dad.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.377
I'd be more interested
if we had ancestors

05:12.379 --> 05:15.647
in, oh, say, Aspen.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.183
Look, if you and ALF really want
to go, then go

05:18.185 --> 05:21.353
but I'm not gonna spend three
days in the desert with a baby.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.955
You wouldn't have to. We could
book a cabin in the mountains.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.525
They're close by.
And here's the kicker

05:26.527 --> 05:29.995
you could have a weekend
without ALF.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.832
Do they rent those cabins
by the month?

05:35.369 --> 05:38.470
Was that a shot at me?
I wasn't paying attention.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.506
Okay. Alright. It's a deal.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.808
If you agree to spend

05:42.810 --> 05:44.076
the last day of the trip
with me and the kids.

05:44.078 --> 05:46.011
There's no need to waste
the entire weekend.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.780
Two days would be fine.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.483
Great. I'll order the dynamite.

05:54.822 --> 05:57.255
[instrumental music]

05:57.257 --> 06:00.225
¶ Oh my darling oh my darling ¶

06:00.227 --> 06:03.195
¶ Oh my darling Clementine ¶

06:03.197 --> 06:06.631
¶ You are lost
and gone forever ¶

06:06.633 --> 06:09.935
¶ Dreadful sorry Clementine ¶¶

06:11.705 --> 06:13.972
Willie, I don't feel right about

06:13.974 --> 06:16.108
leaving you
at the end of this dead-end road

06:16.110 --> 06:18.910
in the middle of this
godforsaken wilderness.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.345
Don't ask me why.

06:20.347 --> 06:24.015
We've got a tent, food, water.
We'll be fine.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.084
You've also got an alien.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.987
Trust me. I'm really
looking forward to this.

06:28.989 --> 06:32.023
Imagine.
The area is virtually unchanged

06:32.025 --> 06:36.962
since Silas Tanner
lived here over 90 years ago.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.530
I love what he did
with the place.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.666
Isn't it exciting?

06:41.668 --> 06:43.201
Imagine, your great-grandfather

06:43.203 --> 06:46.138
might have sat
right on that very rock.

06:46.140 --> 06:49.207
Oh, you're gonna come back
with stories.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.409
Listen, you guys.

06:50.411 --> 06:54.613
Your great-great-grandfather
lived two miles

06:54.615 --> 06:59.351
two miles...out there somewhere.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.454
That's great, Dad.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.023
Mom, does the hotel have a pool?

07:05.025 --> 07:08.193
You guys better get going
before it gets any hotter.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.795
It gets hotter?

07:11.465 --> 07:16.134
- Bye. Bye, ALF.
- Hey. Wait up. Don't.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.906
[instrumental music]

07:26.380 --> 07:29.147
Are you sure
this is the right place?

07:29.149 --> 07:32.017
According to the map,
we went through Dead Man's Gorge

07:32.019 --> 07:34.019
we climbed up Dead Man's Bluff

07:34.021 --> 07:36.788
we turned left
at Dead Man's Canyon

07:36.790 --> 07:39.057
so by process of elimination

07:39.059 --> 07:42.427
this has got to be
Dead Man's Rock.

07:42.429 --> 07:45.197
What is it about this place
that gives me the creeps?

07:46.533 --> 07:47.699
[panting]

07:47.701 --> 07:49.201
I'm exhausted.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.705
ALF.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.675
ALF, these canteens are empty.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.710
What did you do with the water?

07:58.712 --> 08:00.245
I drank it.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.581
All of it?

08:04.017 --> 08:05.684
What's the big deal?

08:05.686 --> 08:08.954
You've got a whole desert out
here, for heaven's sake.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.857
There's no water in the desert.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.393
There's no water in the desert?

08:15.395 --> 08:17.062
What was I thinking?

08:18.765 --> 08:20.198
Ocean.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.636
So you're saying this water
thing might be a problem?

08:27.007 --> 08:29.274
Only if you consider
dying a problem.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.914
Well, here's another fine mess
you've gotten us into.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.617
[ALF sighs]

08:38.619 --> 08:41.119
[instrumental music]

08:42.890 --> 08:45.290
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Save some for me.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.426
I can't believe it.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.061
I can't believe
you'd leave us stranded

08:50.063 --> 08:51.630
here in the desert
without any water.

08:51.632 --> 08:55.667
Oh, I thought we were past that.
I said I was sorry.

08:55.669 --> 08:59.037
Would it help if I pounded my
thumb with a sharp rock?

09:00.807 --> 09:03.008
Here you are.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.143
Sorry. The moment has passed.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.648
Just read me the map.
What does it say to do next?

09:09.650 --> 09:14.152
Alright. It says to stand at
the center of the rock base..

09:16.290 --> 09:20.258
'...face north
and go three paces..'

09:21.995 --> 09:24.629
'...then turn and go
three paces east.'

09:26.033 --> 09:27.599
Come on. Chop-chop.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.670
- Now what?
- Well, that's it.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.606
Whatever old Silas buried
is right there.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.777
I'd be excited
if I weren't so hot

09:38.779 --> 09:40.612
and queasy and dehydrated.

09:40.614 --> 09:44.983
Don't let that spoil it for you.
Start digging.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.251
I don't suppose
you'd like to dig

09:46.253 --> 09:47.619
since I carried the backpacks

09:47.621 --> 09:50.322
and you're retaining
most of the water.

09:50.324 --> 09:53.291
Hey, hey,
he was your great-grandfather.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.263
You mean to say you don't plan
on doing any work?

09:58.265 --> 10:00.398
Alright, alright.
I'll tell you what.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.134
I'll take every third shift.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.103
Now just start digging.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.310
[instrumental music]

10:16.817 --> 10:18.583
[ALF humming]

10:19.786 --> 10:22.053
[spits]

10:22.055 --> 10:24.422
You're not eating bugs, are you?

10:24.424 --> 10:26.658
That would be disgusting,
Willie.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.861
I'm merely sucking the moisture
out of them.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.063
You want one?

10:32.065 --> 10:34.299
- No. No.
- You sure?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.735
They taste a lot better
than Kate's meatloaf

10:36.737 --> 10:39.237
and you don't have to
drown them in ketchup.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.441
Are you sure
this is the right spot?

10:43.443 --> 10:47.746
Because I-I'm hitting nothing
but rocks here.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.781
Of course I'm sure.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.349
I'm more than sure.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.752
Uh-oh.

10:56.890 --> 11:00.291
I hope that was just a bug
that went down the wrong way.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.995
Tell me what "uh-oh?"

11:03.997 --> 11:07.599
Alright,
but first put down the shovel.

11:07.601 --> 11:09.200
Tell me.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.302
You know,
one day you're gonna laugh

11:11.304 --> 11:14.305
about the time you dragged
yourself across the desert

11:14.307 --> 11:16.508
and dug a hole
in the wrong place.

11:17.778 --> 11:21.046
Again, I must insist
that you put down the shovel.

11:23.116 --> 11:26.284
How could you make a mistake
like that?

11:26.286 --> 11:29.187
Well, I had the map upside-down.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.524
Should have gone
three paces south.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.293
You mean to say I've been
digging for 45 minutes

11:35.295 --> 11:37.495
and it's the wrong spot?

11:37.497 --> 11:40.598
Look at the upside.
Now we have a latrine.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.203
'Or better yet, a small grave.'

11:47.507 --> 11:50.075
Alright. Relax.
Look, all you have to do

11:50.077 --> 11:52.777
is move two paces to the right.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.279
- Uh, left.
- Give me that.

11:58.285 --> 12:01.086
[ALF humming "I've Been
Working On The Railroad"]

12:08.095 --> 12:10.361
Alright. That's quite enough.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.764
Fine. Music hater.

12:14.134 --> 12:17.035
Alright. Your turn.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.670
Well, hold it.
This is a new hole.

12:18.672 --> 12:20.572
We start the rotation
over again.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.707
[Willie groans]

12:22.709 --> 12:26.511
No, we haven't been through
rotation once yet.

12:26.513 --> 12:29.814
I-I'm not digging anymore.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.649
Willie, if Silas heard you now

12:31.651 --> 12:34.786
he'd be spinning
in his piano crate.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.588
If he wasn't so fat.

12:38.558 --> 12:41.760
Listen, ALF,
if you want to dig, dig.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.995
I'm through.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.564
Oh, so that's your game, huh?

12:46.566 --> 12:50.068
Work me to death and keep
the treasure to yourself.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.170
You haven't done any work yet.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.240
Well, I'm a drone alien,
not a worker alien.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.310
Alright. Alright.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.646
Just keep your hands
off my bugs.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.815
I know exactly
how many there are.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.252
I'll try to refrain.

13:09.823 --> 13:12.524
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

13:14.194 --> 13:16.761
- What now?
- I got a blister.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.398
In five seconds?

13:20.400 --> 13:23.201
Hey, I worked through the pain
as long as I could.

13:24.604 --> 13:27.272
Oh, you haven't even tried.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.009
[groans]

13:31.011 --> 13:33.978
Oh, I can't do it. I can't.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.080
I'm hot, I'm thirsty

13:36.082 --> 13:39.751
I'm a little bit country,
I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.024
ALF, you're hot.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.526
Well, my last album
didn't go platinum

13:48.528 --> 13:51.095
but Donny says not to worry.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.464
No, I mean your temperature.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.466
Of course, I should have
realized your fur

13:55.468 --> 13:57.769
would retain all this heat.

13:57.771 --> 14:01.506
Well, that's why you don't
find a lot of us in Miami Beach.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.642
Look. It's over, pal.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.278
Why don't you just
go sit in the tent?

14:07.280 --> 14:11.282
Tomorrow evening, we'll,
we'll hike out of here.

14:11.284 --> 14:15.987
Okay, but I need to use
the small grave first.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.856
Turn around and hum.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.598
[instrumental music]

14:32.072 --> 14:34.172
Hi, Mom. Hi, Eric.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.640
Hi, kids. How was your day?

14:35.642 --> 14:38.743
It was fun. I went
horseback riding in the woods.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.612
And I fed a chipmunk.

14:40.614 --> 14:44.015
That's great. Pack your bags.
We're getting out of here.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.717
Mom, they're gonna be okay.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.652
Dad knows how to
take care of himself.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.687
No, no. I haven't felt
good about this

14:49.689 --> 14:50.955
ever since we dropped them off.

14:50.957 --> 14:53.625
Something is wrong,
I just know it.

14:53.627 --> 14:55.660
He's got ALF.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.695
Pack later. Get in the car.

14:57.697 --> 15:01.132
- Way to go, Brian.
- What'd I say?

15:01.134 --> 15:03.434
Mom, it's what he wanted to do.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.303
They're having fun.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.205
They're on one of those
male-bonding things

15:07.207 --> 15:09.107
that guys think are really cool.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.541
Besides, we don't know
where they are

15:10.543 --> 15:12.477
you can't take Eric
into the desert

15:12.479 --> 15:15.146
and there's a frat party
in Cabin 12.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.949
And besides,
maybe they'll find gold.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.484
Well, alright.

15:19.486 --> 15:22.086
I'll be happy if they just find
their way back to the road.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.488
I'm sure they will.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.857
If you need me,
I'll be in Cabin 12.

15:25.859 --> 15:27.392
Me too.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.898
[instrumental music]

15:43.243 --> 15:45.310
A June bug for your thoughts.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.546
Oh.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.515
I was just marveling
at your ability

15:50.517 --> 15:53.618
to start a four-alarm fire
in the desert.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.054
Desert.

15:57.857 --> 16:00.725
I was just trying
to summon help.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.995
I saw a plane,
so I built a signal fire.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.533
By the way,
thanks for putting me out.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.537
You saw a vulture,
not an airplane.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.475
That vulture could be bringing
us help as we speak.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.411
Yeah. More vultures.

16:22.949 --> 16:26.150
I think one of us
has an attitude problem.

16:26.152 --> 16:29.620
Okay, so we don't have any food,
water or shelter.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.490
But we still have air.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.559
And each other.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.397
Well, we have air.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.165
Your point?

16:41.167 --> 16:45.403
My point is I'm sorry and
I'd like to make it up to you.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.338
I'll cook dinner.

16:47.340 --> 16:52.410
What dinner?
The food went up with the tent!

16:53.947 --> 16:55.513
While you were sulking

16:55.515 --> 16:58.783
I gathered
some miniature desert lobsters.

17:00.086 --> 17:01.252
[chuckles]

17:01.254 --> 17:02.920
Feast your eyes.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.692
[gasping]

17:09.929 --> 17:11.562
They're scorpions.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.498
They were all born
in the same month?

17:14.401 --> 17:16.067
What are the odds?

17:21.307 --> 17:24.809
I should have walked to town
while I still had the strength.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.844
No. We can't give up now.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.647
We're too close
to finding the foam.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.649
What are you talking about?

17:31.651 --> 17:36.554
Oh, were you planning on leaving
me stranded out here to die?

17:36.556 --> 17:38.589
Oh, ALF, I think
the heat's gotten to you.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.858
You're starting to babble.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.094
Au contraire.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.729
Hey, could you go ask
the lifeguard

17:44.731 --> 17:46.831
if it's safe to move closer
to the water?

17:47.867 --> 17:49.067
ALF.

17:49.069 --> 17:52.036
And I think that couple
from Ohio stole our cooler.

17:53.673 --> 17:57.809
Brian, don't go out so far
without a life preserver.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.679
Listen, ALF, tomorrow

18:01.681 --> 18:03.347
I'm gonna build a
shelter of what's left

18:03.349 --> 18:04.882
of our blankets
and sleeping bags

18:04.884 --> 18:07.118
and-and you'll have some shade.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.821
And then, uh, I'll walk
the 20 or so miles

18:09.823 --> 18:11.889
to town to get some help. Okay?

18:11.891 --> 18:15.026
I knew it. You're gonna let me
stay out here and die.

18:15.028 --> 18:17.462
No. No. You-you'll be alright.
I promise you.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.431
I'll come back for you and we'll
come back here another weekend.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.066
Now I think we should..

18:22.068 --> 18:24.035
I think we should try to get
some rest.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.904
Okay, but ring the front desk

18:26.906 --> 18:29.240
and leave a 6 o'clock
wake-up call.

18:34.581 --> 18:37.148
[wolf howls]

18:37.150 --> 18:39.750
[shovel scraping]

18:41.554 --> 18:43.154
Give up. Ha.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.589
He must be mad.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.791
Mad, I tell me, mad.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.526
No one's gonna cheat me
out of my right

18:48.528 --> 18:50.728
to someone else's legacy.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.531
[clattering]

18:53.533 --> 18:56.934
Hey, what's this?

18:56.936 --> 18:58.136
Wooden planks!

18:58.138 --> 19:01.439
Yes! Yes!
I found the treasure!

19:01.441 --> 19:04.208
I'm, I'm going to be stupid!

19:04.210 --> 19:05.943
[laughs]

19:07.347 --> 19:08.946
[screams]

19:10.316 --> 19:12.250
[water splashes]

19:12.252 --> 19:16.587
ALF. ALF, where are you?

19:18.525 --> 19:20.057
(ALF)
'Down here.'

19:21.661 --> 19:23.161
What happened?

19:23.163 --> 19:25.196
(ALF)
'I was looking for gold,
but all I found'

19:25.198 --> 19:28.466
'was this ice-cold
Jacuzzi instead.'

19:28.468 --> 19:30.935
'I'm drowning.
Get me out of here.'

19:30.937 --> 19:34.071
I-I'll go tear one of the
sleeping bags into a rope.

19:34.073 --> 19:35.907
I'll be right back.
Don't go away.

19:35.909 --> 19:38.643
(ALF)
'I'll try not to wander off.'

19:38.645 --> 19:40.778
'Just my luck,
I fall down a well'

19:40.780 --> 19:44.549
'there's no townspeople around
to fight over the movie rights.'

19:46.786 --> 19:50.154
I was worried about you.
I'm glad you're okay.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.190
Couldn't be better.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.492
I have just one question.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.961
Your grandfather buried water.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.198
Your question?

20:00.200 --> 20:02.400
Well, he was an idiot, right?

20:02.402 --> 20:05.369
Well, no. He probably buried it
to prevent anybody else

20:05.371 --> 20:07.572
from finding and using it.

20:07.574 --> 20:12.009
Oh, I'm sorry.
He was a selfish idiot.

20:12.011 --> 20:15.880
Well, lucky for us, because
now we got drinking water.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.616
Uh-oh.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.118
Oh. Not again.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.987
Afraid so.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.223
I was down there a long time,
Willie.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.892
You couldn't have drunk
all that water.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.729
No. But I did drink
a lot of water.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.631
A lot of water.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.968
You didn't.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.403
I wasn't known on Melmac
as the "whiz kid"

20:39.405 --> 20:41.872
because of my
scholastic ability.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.947
[instrumental music]

20:53.286 --> 20:55.720
Luckily, once the coyotes
got one look at ALF

20:55.722 --> 20:58.589
they marked him and ran away.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.925
Hey, I got them back, didn't I?

21:02.028 --> 21:04.595
Well, I'm just glad
I followed my instincts

21:04.597 --> 21:06.264
and came to get you early.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.332
- Ooh.
- Oh, honey.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.103
So, Dad, are you sorry
Great-great-grandpa

21:12.105 --> 21:14.405
turned out to be such a loser?

21:14.407 --> 21:15.906
He wasn't a loser.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.409
He covered up a well
to protect a piece of property

21:18.411 --> 21:22.480
that served no
useful purpose whatsoever

21:22.482 --> 21:26.417
and he felt it was important
to leave us that as his legacy.

21:26.419 --> 21:30.488
- But he wasn't a loser, right?
- No, he wasn't.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.524
He was a proud,
yet needlessly eccentric man.

21:33.526 --> 21:36.761
I say let's just leave
this nightmare behind us.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.462
Kate, why don't you..

21:38.464 --> 21:41.265
Why don't you take the kids
and go on that nature hike?

21:41.267 --> 21:44.769
- Well, are you sure, honey?
- We could stay, Dad.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.605
No, I'll be fine.
Just-just leave me the ointment.

21:47.607 --> 21:51.075
Hey, don't worry about Willie.
I'll take care of him.

21:52.145 --> 21:55.146
Maybe a long hike's
just what I need.

21:55.148 --> 21:58.149
- Aren't you in a lot of pain?
- I am. Let's go.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.891
Well, I have nothing to do.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.860
Guess I'll build a fire.
