WEBVTT

00:06.360 --> 00:09.330
Ah. Good evening, father.
You're looking sharp.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.920
Mr. Valmont, the tally.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.004
Moments away.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.725
Gentlemen.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.289
What are the standing totals?

00:34.480 --> 00:37.848
Master Tyler King, $67,800,000.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.371
All bids paid in full.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.810
Master Francis King, $67,400,000...

00:44.000 --> 00:47.891
...with one account pending
for $1.8 million.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.441
You haven't won yet.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.369
I have, and you know it.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.081
The contractual deadline has passed.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.361
The last tally stands.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.962
Mr. Cardini failed to wire funds
for his lot.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.889
I'm sorry.

01:13.480 --> 01:17.610
Well, boys, get on with it.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.651
Next time.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.247
I'm sorry. I've got nothing right for you.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.681
- If something comes in...
- I just need to go back in.

01:59.880 --> 02:04.408
- I don't care what it is. I'll take anything.
- You don't wanna do that. Sit down.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.691
You got class.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.485
You're the boyfriend.
You're the hip, young executive.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.644
That's where the top dollar is.

02:13.960 --> 02:17.328
Anything else, for you,
is a sinful waste.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.284
But I don't care.

02:19.480 --> 02:23.280
I don't care about top dollar.
I just need to go back under.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.808
Bud, please. It's me.
I can play anything.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.207
Don't tell me that girl got to you.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.371
If you need a palate-cleansing so bad,
I may have something.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.446
How's your German?

02:51.560 --> 02:54.291
I hope you're considering the apartment
at the Audrey.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.522
You must stop living like this.

02:56.720 --> 03:00.122
By all means, come right in.
Make yourself at home.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.762
Madeline Pratt has been abducted.

03:02.960 --> 03:05.361
What do you care?
She almost got us both killed.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.289
Foreplay.

03:07.480 --> 03:12.122
My relationship with Madeline
is nuanced.

03:12.880 --> 03:16.680
Confounding, yet captivating,
she's a singular woman...

03:16.920 --> 03:20.242
...and the world is far more interesting
with her in it.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.489
What's more,
her abductors meet every requisite...

03:23.720 --> 03:26.883
...that defines inclusion
on The Blacklist.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.441
The Kings.

03:28.680 --> 03:29.806
The kings? Of what?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.128
Not "king" as in "king and castle."

03:32.320 --> 03:36.166
Earl King and his two sons,
Tyler and Francis...

03:36.400 --> 03:38.721
...descendants
of a senescent dynasty.

03:38.920 --> 03:43.847
Their forefathers built a fortune
on the backs of British undesirables...

03:44.040 --> 03:47.203
...forcing them into decades
of indentured servitude.

03:47.400 --> 03:53.203
A tradition that has been passed
from generation to generation...

03:53.400 --> 03:55.323
...that still continues today.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.409
What does this have to do
with Madeline?

03:57.600 --> 04:01.605
Madeline has made a number
of well-heeled enemies over the years...

04:01.840 --> 04:04.446
...many of whom would pay
a handsome price for her head.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.441
If merely saving a woman's life...

04:07.680 --> 04:10.126
...isn't enough
to warrant the Bureau's interest...

04:10.320 --> 04:13.005
...consider
what taking down a dynasty...

04:13.200 --> 04:15.248
...like the King family would mean.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.005
Every transaction...

04:17.200 --> 04:21.762
...meticulously recorded for posterity
in the family ledger.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.531
Sometimes, years pass
between auctions.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.007
They're never held
in the same place twice.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.288
The guest lists
are constantly changing.

04:29.480 --> 04:33.087
This is your chance to solve
a century and a half's...

04:33.280 --> 04:35.681
...worth of abductions and thefts...

04:35.920 --> 04:39.083
...from the Davidoff-Morini
Stradivarius...

04:39.280 --> 04:43.729
...to the disappearance
of Raoul Wallenberg.

04:44.280 --> 04:49.525
This phone belonged to a boy in the Port
of Lisbon, where Madeline was abducted.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.000
Pictures of the kidnapping.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.688
Find the jackals who took Madeline...

04:53.880 --> 04:57.282
...and they'll inevitably lead you
to the Kings.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.530
So we're going after one Blacklister
to save another.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.405
- Tell me how that makes sense.
- Earl King and his sons...

05:04.600 --> 05:05.647
...Tyler and Francis.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.686
From intel, they appear to be an eccentric
family of trust-fund billionaires.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.645
According to Reddington,
they supplement their fortune...

05:12.840 --> 05:15.047
...with profits from
their illegal auctions.

05:15.240 --> 05:18.608
Six months ago, 22 pounds
of yellowcake uranium...

05:18.800 --> 05:22.646
...seized by MI5 disappeared
from their evidence vault in Leeds.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.680
The painting, stolen from the
Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.963
Reddington claims both these items
will fall under the gavel...

05:30.160 --> 05:32.766
...at the Kings' next auction.
- I might have something.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.645
I isolated this image from the pics...

05:35.840 --> 05:38.127
...ran it against our database,
and got a hit.

05:38.320 --> 05:42.405
Silvio Haratz, a Brazilian-born kidnapper
working the world's K&R hotspots.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.963
If the auction's gonna be held
on U.S. soil, Haratz is headed here.

05:46.160 --> 05:49.607
- We're gonna need local intel.
- The DOJ has an active file on Haratz.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.691
I can't open it
without throwing up red flags.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.484
I may know someone who can help.

05:54.680 --> 05:58.048
The rest of you,
dig up anything you can on the Kings.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.045
What do you have on Haratz?

06:00.240 --> 06:02.800
Enough to haul him in,
but not enough to make it stick.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.531
That's all I can say.
We're building a case.

06:05.760 --> 06:09.765
I have a good friend,
CEO of a med-tech company.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.928
Got himself mixed up
in a fraud scheme.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.451
The grand jury convened...

06:13.680 --> 06:16.729
...and it's looking like
there's going to be an indictment.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.365
They'll seize his assets.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.609
It would be nice if he had a chance...

06:20.800 --> 06:23.565
...to shield something
in a blind trust for his kids.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.650
- You want me to tip him off?
- He's a good friend, close friend.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.489
And I take care of my friends.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.131
How's that clinical trial?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.409
The one I got you into?

06:37.760 --> 06:39.410
You look well.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.088
Agent Keen.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.171
- Hello.
- The suspect's name is Silvio Haratz.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.125
He's using a safe house
called The Palace. We're on our way.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.526
No. I know The Palace.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.001
You people get within a mile,
you'll be made.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.690
- I'll handle it.
- Forget it.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.326
We're not on your payroll,
and you can't call us off.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.409
We're on it.

07:41.840 --> 07:45.401
- How much do you want for her?
- You can have her.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.928
Sorry, Dembe.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.923
Well-played, Madeline.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.487
Payback for my little gambit last year,
I presume.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.170
Consider us even.

07:56.920 --> 08:00.322
Raymond "Red" Reddington.

08:00.520 --> 08:01.760
Lot number 11.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.646
Beautiful.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.520
Careful there, boys.
You don't wanna bruise the merchandise.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.567
We intercepted Dembe.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.167
They used Pratt as bait,
faked the kidnapping...

08:54.360 --> 08:56.203
...to bring Red into the Kings' custody.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.722
King family auctions are about
providing criminals with items of value.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.604
What's more valuable
than Reddington?

09:01.800 --> 09:03.404
Where are we on auction locations?

09:03.640 --> 09:07.008
The Kings have real-estate holdings
all over the world.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.884
You'd have to be invited to know.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.526
Let's not focus on the Kings.
Focus on the guests.

09:11.720 --> 09:15.884
Match the items they have for sale
with people interested in buying them.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.448
Put together a list. Alert Immigration
and TSA on major points of entry.

09:19.640 --> 09:20.971
Identify and report only.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.850
Do not detain.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.442
Your insistence on not speaking, sir...

09:29.640 --> 09:33.361
...is making a tedious exercise
ever so much worse.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.166
Over here, gentlemen.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.010
Please.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.123
Someone help me.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.607
Raymond Reddington in the flesh.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.529
You must be Tyler.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.927
Hope you're not as shortsighted
as your brother.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.202
I could be one
of your most valued customers.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.249
You're one of the few prospects...

09:55.440 --> 09:59.968
...who rejected an invitation
to our auction. Nice try, though.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.521
I haven't even begun to try.

10:02.840 --> 10:06.731
There is one thing about your family
that's always intrigued me.

10:06.960 --> 10:11.170
Statistically, 65 percent
of inherited fortunes...

10:11.360 --> 10:13.806
...are frittered away
by the second generation.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.684
Ninety percent by the third.

10:15.920 --> 10:19.925
How is it that the Kings
have successfully defied that trend?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.771
You must tell me your secret.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.371
Winner takes all.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.761
And the loser?

10:25.960 --> 10:28.042
None of your business.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.169
Really, I'm all for being thorough...

10:35.400 --> 10:38.404
...but at this point,
you're just taking the nickel tour.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.009
Alexi Koskov, a Russian oligarch...

10:44.240 --> 10:47.084
...with an extensive collection
of stolen masterpieces.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.363
Art Crime Division says he's
been trying to acquire the Van Gogh...

10:50.560 --> 10:52.085
...since it disappeared in 2002.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.680
Koskov's on the no-fly list.
How can he get into the country?

10:54.760 --> 10:58.765
He can't. But his new acquisitions
emissary, Josephine Sullivan...

10:58.960 --> 11:02.567
...flew in from L.A. this morning.
She just checked into the Vanguard.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.290
Bring her in.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.851
- I presume you've been downstairs.
- I have.

11:08.160 --> 11:11.289
Reddington's a game changer.
You can't win.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.450
I have no intention of quitting now.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.043
Even if you win,
I only have a 16 percent chance of losing.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.566
One in six.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.728
We know you're working
as a representative for Alexi Koskov...

11:24.920 --> 11:28.083
...to purchase a stolen painting
from an illegal auction.

11:28.280 --> 11:31.045
As such, we can charge you
as an accessory after the fact...

11:31.240 --> 11:35.086
...not only for the Van Gogh, but for every
crime the King family has committed...

11:35.280 --> 11:37.169
...to acquire the rest of their stock...

11:37.360 --> 11:40.011
...including kidnapping
and false imprisonment.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.211
This is the Bureau's file
on you and your boss.

11:44.040 --> 11:46.611
Koskov is untouchable.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.609
But you're right here.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.691
Instructions were to introduce herself
to the concierge...

11:55.880 --> 11:58.804
...at Harleston Read Hotel.
- Owned by the King family trust.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.002
- Everyone is on their payroll.
- That's it?

12:01.240 --> 12:04.050
She's supposed to ask for a room
with a view of the Capitol.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.965
- Then what?
- Get a room. After, no idea.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.725
She's never attended the auction.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.321
Beyond the hotel and the password,
we have nothing.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.807
That's not necessarily true.

12:14.040 --> 12:17.726
They're expecting an American
named Josephine Sullivan.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.371
We can give them that.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.848
Undercover? Forget it.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.089
I know you want him back,
but there has to be another way.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.806
If you can think of one, I'm all ears.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.686
Okay. We do it.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.405
But only as far as the hotel.

12:32.640 --> 12:36.122
Go there. I'll have a TAC team
standing by to hit the auction.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.325
Keen.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.845
It's me.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.844
What are you doing calling me?

12:44.040 --> 12:46.327
Got a new assignment.
I'm going away for a while.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.727
- What's her name?
- It's not like that.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.161
- It's not...
- Me?

12:50.360 --> 12:52.886
Yeah. I mean, no. I mean... It's, uh...

12:53.520 --> 12:55.409
- How you been?
- What do you think?

12:56.120 --> 12:57.963
I'm in a lot of trouble because of you.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.407
So, what? That's it?

13:00.600 --> 13:04.810
Berlin is out of commission,
and you just get another gig?

13:06.720 --> 13:09.644
Going away for a long time,
and I thought I'd...

13:10.560 --> 13:12.642
I don't know. I just wanted to say...

13:12.840 --> 13:15.764
I think the word you're looking for
is goodbye.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.804
I gotta go. It seems like
the only thing we have in common...

13:19.000 --> 13:20.729
...is pretending to be someone else.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.605
Wait. You're going undercover?
For how long?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.889
Just a few hours.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.242
Keep your ears open.
Try not to talk too much.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.086
Somebody asks you something
that you don't know...

13:31.280 --> 13:33.089
...and it's gonna trip you up, sneeze.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.327
- Sneeze?
- Yeah.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.488
They'll say "gesundheit"
or "bless you"...

13:36.680 --> 13:39.081
...10 out of 10,
they'll forget what they asked you.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.926
I always thought you just had allergies.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.769
Goodbye, Liz.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.166
You'll need this for the elevator.
Enjoy your stay.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.845
Thank you.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.441
She should have a tracker,
comms at least.

14:06.640 --> 14:07.926
She's going in blind.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.884
She can handle it.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.761
She's in.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.607
I have a reservation. Sullivan.

14:28.840 --> 14:32.003
- Josephine Sullivan.
- Of course, Miss Sullivan.

14:32.840 --> 14:35.047
- We have you in a one-bedroom suite.
- With a view.

14:35.240 --> 14:39.211
- Excuse me?
- I requested a view of the capitol.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.523
That can be arranged.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.169
Eighteen sixty-one.
Last elevator on the left.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.766
"Eighteen sixty-one."

15:07.120 --> 15:10.727
She's in Elevator 1.
I repeat, Elevator 1.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.964
Phone, purse, jewelry.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.127
She's going down.
I repeat, she's going down.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.525
Get a visual.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.810
Welcome, Miss Sullivan.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.329
Thank you.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.571
Eighteen sixty-one.

16:35.920 --> 16:39.242
It wasn't a hotel room.
It was a parking space.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.610
Drink.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.409
- What is it?
- Drink.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.446
Good heavens, Earl.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.888
You've never had any feeling
in your heart...

18:47.080 --> 18:49.970
...now it looks like there isn't much
going on below the waist.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.491
I do all right.

18:51.920 --> 18:57.370
The wheelchair is just a little memento
of our time together in Bolivia.

18:57.560 --> 18:59.085
No hard feelings, I trust.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.971
Just a few.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.365
But this is only business, Red.

19:06.160 --> 19:09.721
Besides, you warned me.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.849
Pigs eat...

19:12.080 --> 19:13.889
Hogs get slaughtered.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.409
All you had to do was listen.

19:18.600 --> 19:22.002
But that's always been your problem,
all that money clogging your ears.

19:22.200 --> 19:25.761
I told you to come with me that night
out on the altiplano.

19:25.960 --> 19:29.567
I had millions invested.

19:29.760 --> 19:33.401
I couldn't just walk away like you.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.365
Poor choice of words
given what those soldiers did to you.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.565
I'd hate to see you
play the hog yet again, Earl.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.445
No, no, Red.

19:43.320 --> 19:47.484
You taught me an invaluable lesson.

19:48.040 --> 19:54.002
Dispassion
is the businessman's best friend.

19:54.520 --> 19:59.401
One mustn't get emotionally involved
in business.

19:59.600 --> 20:04.128
You have to listen to the market.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.330
You hear that?

20:07.000 --> 20:12.245
That's the market telling me
you are in demand.

20:13.160 --> 20:16.846
What kind of a commodity are you?

20:17.040 --> 20:21.489
A wealth of secrets and information?

20:21.840 --> 20:28.291
Or are you an impulse purchase
for a buyer to settle a score?

20:28.760 --> 20:31.843
You scare people, Red.

20:32.080 --> 20:37.564
How much would you pay
to be rid of your deepest fear?

20:37.760 --> 20:42.209
I've always found fear
to be my most valuable sense.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.289
But then again,
you Kings demonstrate...

20:44.480 --> 20:48.166
...a propensity
for having more dollars than sense.

20:49.240 --> 20:53.086
Your son Tyler was telling me,
"Winner takes all," I believe he said.

20:53.280 --> 20:57.649
I'm curious, strictly
from an estate-planning perspective...

20:57.840 --> 20:59.968
...what exactly does that mean?

21:31.760 --> 21:34.081
Good evening, Miss Sullivan.

21:41.720 --> 21:48.001
Take what you want
from the family collection.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.720
Anything you need.

21:50.920 --> 21:54.242
We want you to feel beautiful.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.649
How thoughtful.

22:30.560 --> 22:32.801
Ladies and gentlemen.

22:37.840 --> 22:41.162
Welcome to the Vicarage.

22:42.640 --> 22:48.807
I would like to thank you
for traveling many a weary mile...

22:49.000 --> 22:53.608
...to join us
on this very special evening.

22:53.800 --> 22:58.601
As is customary,
you will have 30 minutes...

22:58.800 --> 23:01.007
...to spend among the lots.

23:01.840 --> 23:05.811
A taste to whet your appetite...

23:06.600 --> 23:10.241
...and loosen your purse strings.

23:21.840 --> 23:25.003
It begins.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.125
Hello.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.524
"Vincent."

23:44.720 --> 23:47.007
See something you like?

23:48.080 --> 23:52.130
Little Vincent Peretti, Miss Sullivan,
of the Peretti family.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.847
Big Vince has turned state's evidence.

23:55.040 --> 23:58.761
There are half a dozen Serbians
and Sicilians willing to pay dearly...

23:58.960 --> 24:02.646
...for the leverage to ensure his silence.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.764
So I understand you're here
on behalf of Mr. Koskov.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.403
Yes, I am. It's rumored Van Gogh
actually painted it at the beach...

24:11.600 --> 24:13.807
...and up close...

24:14.000 --> 24:17.607
...you can see the grains of sand
bonded to the canvas.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.768
Remarkable.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.722
So which Ivy league did you attend?

24:23.920 --> 24:28.562
It's no secret
Alexi fancies a certain breed.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.322
Columbia, then Princeton.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.729
Really? I'm a Princeton man.

24:37.760 --> 24:41.162
The Dinky was such fun, wasn't it?

24:43.680 --> 24:45.364
Bless you.

24:45.600 --> 24:46.886
Oh, the Dinky.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.411
No matter the time of day...

24:48.600 --> 24:53.606
...that damn train is always full
of hungover frat boys and coeds...

24:53.840 --> 24:56.002
...in the throes of morning-after regret.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.929
Is that who I think it is?

24:59.440 --> 25:03.206
Well, I can see
that you are a woman of good taste.

25:03.400 --> 25:08.167
Tyler, I believe the sheikh has questions
about your guidance chips.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.529
The Raymond Reddington.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.326
- Impossible.
- You've changed your hair.

25:14.520 --> 25:16.488
- You know each other.
- Unfortunately.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.603
Perhaps you'd like to make a bid.

25:18.800 --> 25:22.247
I've heard he's far more trouble
than he's worth.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.727
It's probably easier
to let someone else buy him.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.849
Let him be their problem.

25:27.080 --> 25:30.641
I'm here for the Van Gogh. He's probably
out of my price range, anyway.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.849
Not mine.

25:34.520 --> 25:35.806
Yaabari.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.566
How are the boys?

25:38.800 --> 25:42.964
They still tell tales of the man in the hat
who burned down our compound.

25:43.280 --> 25:47.490
I must say, you've come up in the world,
depending on how you look at it.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.287
How did you manage
to wrangle an invitation?

25:50.520 --> 25:51.567
Who's backing you?

25:51.920 --> 25:54.651
I'll see you after the auction.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.286
Just give us the location.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.245
I don't know anything.
I'm a hotel employee.

26:03.440 --> 26:05.408
I arrange transportation.

26:05.600 --> 26:06.647
I was doing my job.

26:07.240 --> 26:10.323
Your job is to shuttle people
back and forth to the King auction.

26:10.520 --> 26:13.364
That woman you sent off in the limo?
She's a federal agent...

26:13.560 --> 26:16.291
...investigating a crime
to which you are now an accessory.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.324
If anything happens to her,
you'll be facing felony charges.

26:19.520 --> 26:22.967
I told you. I don't know anything.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.480
The indictment,
it's coming down tonight.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.524
You and I never had this conversation.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.765
Sir, we may have a problem.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.770
I was checking with DOC
on Josephine's transfer to Hazelton.

26:35.320 --> 26:38.051
- They allowed her to call her lawyer.
- I gave an order.

26:38.280 --> 26:42.205
If she gets word to her people, Keen's
cover is blown. Get DOC on the line now.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.761
Anybody to bid? Now 3.
Who'll give me 3? I've got 3.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.002
Who will give me 4?
Give me 4? I got 4 here.

26:48.200 --> 26:52.569
Anybody to bid? Now 4 and a quarter?
Four million going once, going twice.

26:52.760 --> 26:56.367
Sold for $4 million
to the gentleman from Maldives.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.769
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

27:00.960 --> 27:03.884
...one of the most exciting items
of the night...

27:04.080 --> 27:07.050
...a mainstay
on the FBI's most wanted list...

27:07.240 --> 27:10.926
...this gentleman has been on the list
longer than any other criminal.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.407
A former Naval intelligence officer...

27:13.600 --> 27:16.490
...he possesses a wealth
of classified information...

27:16.680 --> 27:22.005
...and presides over one of the world's
most prosperous extralegal empires.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.608
You may know him
as the Concierge of Crime.

27:26.200 --> 27:29.409
I present Raymond Reddington.

27:34.640 --> 27:37.450
I will commence
the bidding at $2 million.

27:38.560 --> 27:41.769
Anybody to bid? Now 2.
Who will give me 2? I've got 2 right here.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.088
Who will give 2 and a half?
Now 2 and a half.

27:44.280 --> 27:45.850
Thank you, ma'am. Anybody to bid?

27:46.040 --> 27:48.725
- Well, that's unexpected, but welcome.
- What is she doing?

27:48.920 --> 27:51.161
She's supposed to be here
for my Van Gogh.

27:51.360 --> 27:54.011
Give me 5. Anybody to bid? Now 5.
Thank you in the back.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.726
I got 5. Give me 6. Anybody to bid?
Now 6. Thank you.

27:56.920 --> 28:00.003
Anybody to bid? Now 7. Anybody to bid?
Now 7. It's only money.

28:00.240 --> 28:03.289
Anybody to bid? Now 7. I'll take it, ma'am.
Anybody to bid? Now 8.

28:03.480 --> 28:04.766
Sir, Mr. Koskov called.

28:04.960 --> 28:08.806
The woman who says she's his emissary,
Mr. Koskov said she's an impostor.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.327
I knew it.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.801
Anybody to bid? Now 9.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.929
- Bring her to me.
- Yes, sir.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.167
It's only money, folks.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.044
- Who will give me 9?
- Nine.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.688
I beg your pardon?

28:21.120 --> 28:23.600
Nine million.
I assume my money's good here.

28:24.320 --> 28:26.891
- Ten!
- Certainly as good as his. Fifteen.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.605
- Sixteen.
- Come on.

28:28.800 --> 28:32.202
I gotta be worth as much as that fake
Xuande Ming vessel was. Seventeen.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.481
Eighteen!

28:33.680 --> 28:36.206
Sorry, Santos,
those cat's eye chrysoberyls are brown.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.681
An expensive forgery,
but a forgery nonetheless.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.370
- Twenty.
- Ignore that bid!

28:40.560 --> 28:43.609
- That hardly seems fair.
- Get him off the stage now!

28:43.800 --> 28:46.167
Does the gentlemen maintain his bid
of $18 million?

28:46.360 --> 28:49.728
You're leaving money on the table.
What kind of business are you running?

28:49.920 --> 28:51.763
Eighteen million
going once, going twice.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.642
Sold for $18 million
to the gentleman from Cameroon!

29:08.880 --> 29:10.291
- Give us the room.
- Sir?

29:10.480 --> 29:12.164
Now, Agent Ressler.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.881
I don't think
you quite understand the situation.

29:44.760 --> 29:47.604
You're assuming you're
a material witness in federal custody...

29:47.840 --> 29:49.729
...and are entitled to certain rights.

29:49.920 --> 29:53.322
And while these things are true,
what you don't know...

29:53.640 --> 29:55.768
...is you don't know me.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.731
My doctors recently detected a mass...

29:58.920 --> 30:01.605
...within the left hemisphere
of my brain.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.165
An inoperable tumor.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.564
Within a matter of weeks...

30:06.520 --> 30:08.045
...it will kill me.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.610
And this has clarified a number
of priorities for me.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.484
Among those priorities...

30:13.680 --> 30:17.366
...nothing is more important to me
than the safety of my colleagues.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.006
I'm committed that no one
under my command dies...

30:20.200 --> 30:22.567
...during the remainder of my watch.

30:22.760 --> 30:28.324
And I will do anything within my power
to honor that commitment.

30:29.480 --> 30:34.008
And since I quite literally
have nothing to lose...

30:34.720 --> 30:38.486
...I suggest you think long and hard
before answering my question.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.846
Where is Elizabeth Keen?

31:06.080 --> 31:08.128
Come on. Let's go.

31:08.760 --> 31:12.242
Excuse me. I'm looking for the Van Gogh.
I paid a fortune for it.

31:12.440 --> 31:15.410
All items are held till the end
of the auction. You need to...

31:17.360 --> 31:21.285
Come on. I'm getting you out of here.
Come on. Stay with me.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.205
Okay. Stay right here, okay?

31:23.440 --> 31:24.771
Take me with you, please!

31:25.960 --> 31:27.962
We have to get these people out
of here.

31:28.160 --> 31:29.810
How do you open this thing?

31:30.920 --> 31:33.241
- Lizzy, you need to go.
- Damn it! What's the code?

31:33.440 --> 31:36.284
Listen. I was brought in
through a series of tunnels that way.

31:36.480 --> 31:39.120
If you hurry, you'll be miles away
before they realize you're gone.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.128
Take the boy and go.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.170
You could be killed.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.320
MAN 2  She's off the main
floor. Split up. Check every room.

31:48.520 --> 31:49.567
Help me!

31:51.400 --> 31:55.883
Lizzy, you did everything you could.
It's time to go.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.650
Go.

32:01.240 --> 32:04.130
Spread out!
We need to find that girl immediately.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.040
Come on.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.931
- Get in here. Get down.
- Where the hell's the Peretti boy?

32:14.920 --> 32:20.086
I'm sure your friend with the glass jaw
will enlighten you when he comes to.

32:20.360 --> 32:21.805
Nothing here.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.201
What's in this for you?

32:23.400 --> 32:25.767
You wouldn't understand.
You're not a King.

32:26.280 --> 32:30.604
Heh, heh. Funny. Your father used to say
that exact phrase...

32:30.840 --> 32:34.322
...as if it somehow excused him
from the use of logic.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.081
What's in it for me? Hmm.

32:37.720 --> 32:40.724
Legacy and the King family fortune.

32:40.920 --> 32:44.970
If this is just about the money,
that would be so banal.

32:45.160 --> 32:48.687
I bet your father would trade it all
for one more walk in the park...

32:48.880 --> 32:50.211
...with a good friend.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.723
Tell me...

32:53.560 --> 32:56.803
...where are all your good friends now,
huh?

32:57.000 --> 33:01.130
If you think there's a soul in this world
loyal to anything but your pocketbook...

33:01.320 --> 33:04.927
...then you're the one who's excused
himself from the use of logic.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.968
Your prize.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.762
Let's find that kid!

33:13.920 --> 33:16.969
Vincent, I need you to run
through that door. See it?

33:17.480 --> 33:18.891
Go as far as you can, okay?

33:19.080 --> 33:21.890
You're not coming with me?
You can't go back!

33:22.080 --> 33:24.606
Run. Go! Go!

33:28.040 --> 33:31.089
Yaabari, before you exact
your vengeance, consider this:

33:31.320 --> 33:34.529
I could easily provide you
with enough influence and firepower...

33:34.720 --> 33:36.484
...to crown yourself king.

33:36.680 --> 33:39.490
Isn't it time you stopped running
through the forest...

33:39.680 --> 33:41.762
...playing army with a bunch of kids?

33:41.960 --> 33:45.646
A generous offer, but I'm here
for more than just my vengeance.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.444
I knew it.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.085
Who's backing you?

33:49.280 --> 33:53.569
A man in Johannesburg has put
a $40 million bounty on your head.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.040
I plan to collect it.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.244
Good luck. A lot can happen
between here and Johannesburg.

33:58.440 --> 34:00.522
You will not be traveling
to Johannesburg.

34:00.760 --> 34:02.285
You are not listening.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.926
I said the bounty is on your head.

34:10.880 --> 34:14.089
We shouldn't be doing this
with that FBI agent loose on the property.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.129
She is clearly working
with Reddington.

34:16.360 --> 34:19.887
- Why else would she bid so high?
- To apprehend him.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.885
Who wants Reddington more
than the FBI?

34:23.120 --> 34:25.646
Either way, she'll be found,
so stop making excuses.

34:25.840 --> 34:29.208
- You know I've got you beaten.
- You're getting too emotionally invested.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.686
You realize who you sound like.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.168
Remember the first time I beat you
at tennis?

34:33.560 --> 34:36.370
- That was a long time ago.
- I had you at match point three times...

34:36.560 --> 34:38.960
...and all three times,
I lost in an unforced error.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.844
Then you opened your mouth...

34:41.040 --> 34:44.283
...about how Father
would never entrust the estate to a loser.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.603
I aced you on the next serve.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.564
Right here.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.926
Try not to take it personally.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.043
Business is business.

35:19.240 --> 35:20.810
In fact, Raymond...

35:21.480 --> 35:23.403
...I've always been quite fond of you.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.325
Can't tell you what a comfort that is
to me.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.005
Lizzy.

35:38.760 --> 35:40.569
Lizzy.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.449
The handcuff key's in his back pocket.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.090
Okay.

35:47.240 --> 35:50.244
Someone's gonna come back.
We gotta get out of here.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.445
This is a fiasco.

35:59.640 --> 36:02.041
That impostor took the place
of my invited guest...

36:02.240 --> 36:03.730
...she ignored the Van Gogh...

36:03.920 --> 36:06.491
...drove up the price for Reddington,
and stole the Peretti boy.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.882
How is this any different from Dubai?

36:09.080 --> 36:11.242
Smuggler from the Orient
who had to be ejected.

36:11.480 --> 36:13.448
Cost me 3 million, and I still beat you.

36:13.960 --> 36:16.008
The contractual deadline has passed.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.089
The last tally stands.

36:18.600 --> 36:21.604
Master Francis is the winner.

36:23.440 --> 36:26.569
Father, this is ridiculous.
You must call this off.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.605
You know as well as I do
there is no calling it off.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.605
Get on with it.

36:58.240 --> 37:00.368
If that hammer falls
on an empty chamber...

37:00.560 --> 37:02.608
...you'll be dead
before you hit the ground.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.651
Put it down.

37:13.800 --> 37:14.847
Earl.

37:17.800 --> 37:21.930
Someone should have put you out
of your misery generations ago.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.371
Oh, my God. What are the odds?

37:29.320 --> 37:32.005
I'll leave the three of you
to your own misery.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.490
Avoid the yard,
be nice to your cell mate...

37:36.680 --> 37:40.366
...and whatever you do,
don't eat the franks and beans.

37:45.920 --> 37:49.641
Oh, and I don't need your lousy tux.
I want my clothes back.

Agent Keen says we recovered
a ledger full of names and dates...

38:46.280 --> 38:49.727
...from the King family estate.
Bills of sale being traced back 200 years.

38:49.920 --> 38:52.924
- I'm glad something went well today.
- What do you mean?

38:53.120 --> 38:56.647
I'd been overseeing a fraud case
built against a med-tech CEO.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.330
I got word this morning he fled.

38:58.560 --> 39:01.040
It's like he knew
the indictment was coming.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.523
Nothing that should rain
on your parade.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.882
Congratulate your team for me.

39:19.160 --> 39:21.447
You can never do that again.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.128
- You're welcome.
- I'm serious.

39:24.320 --> 39:28.006
You can never do that again.

39:28.360 --> 39:29.805
Promise me.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.523
We took down dozens
of wanted criminals...

39:32.760 --> 39:36.845
...recovered millions of dollars in stolen
property, and saved innocent lives.

39:37.040 --> 39:39.611
I'm not talking about that.

39:40.480 --> 39:41.845
You.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.929
You're talking about you.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.130
Wow.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.722
You are so damaged.

39:51.360 --> 39:54.011
You can't accept help from anyone.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.840
Has anyone ever helped you?

39:59.440 --> 40:04.082
Is that why you are the way you are?
Because you don't feel deserving of it?

40:04.280 --> 40:07.966
Is that why you can't be vulnerable
for a second?

40:09.880 --> 40:14.283
I risked my life for you
because I care about you.

40:17.640 --> 40:19.802
Deal with that.

40:26.920 --> 40:31.050
When someone does something nice,
you're supposed to say "thank you."

40:34.720 --> 40:36.404
Thank you.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.730
You're welcome.

40:42.120 --> 40:44.327
But never do it again.

41:12.560 --> 41:13.891
What the hell is that?

41:14.760 --> 41:17.843
Can't help it if you're a clumsy pig.

41:47.960 --> 41:49.041
Relax, brother!

41:49.360 --> 41:51.089
I don't want to fight you.

41:51.320 --> 41:53.448
Just want to buy you a beer.

41:54.840 --> 41:56.604
What do I call you?

41:57.440 --> 41:58.521
Christof.

41:59.400 --> 42:00.526
Christof Mannheim.

42:01.080 --> 42:03.128
Good. Come on, my friend.
