00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
James

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Did you intend to end your life?

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
I needed to see.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Wanna go the firewood.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.000
I don't wanna...

01:57.210 --> 02:01.010
Daddy, daddy.

02:04.130 --> 02:06.170
Wanna go outside.

02:09.100 --> 02:11.039
It's okay. It’s okay.

02:11.050 --> 02:13.000
I wanna go… I want outside.

02:13.000 --> 02:13.040
I wanna go… I want outside.
I know. Let’s sing a song okay?

02:13.040 --> 02:16.040
I know. Let’s sing a song okay?

02:17.100 --> 02:23.040
Tell me why, the stars to shine…
I know baby.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
Tell me why, the Ivy twines…
Child: I wanna go outside. Wanna go outside.

02:30.010 --> 02:31.040
Okay. I know.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
Tell me why the sky’s so blue…
Child: I wanna go outside.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
And I will tell you, just why I love you.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.500
Machine.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.500
Wanna go outside.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.500
Keep him safe.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I have heard your order and will comply.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I wanna go outside.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Wanna go outside.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
Day thirty-six report: Father, James continues to grow, and remains safe.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
In the beginning there was the Creator.

04:40.040 --> 04:46.000
He spun his finger and the Earth was formed.
With a thought, the plants and animals dotted the landscape.

04:46.010 --> 04:54.000
From Him flowed man, and from Him, all knowledge.
Man was gifted with intelligence above all others.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
With it man made Machine in his own image.
Just as the Creator had made man in His.

05:01.000 --> 05:10.000
Tell me why the Ivy twines. Tell me why…

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
The Manual version six point zero point one three. Reality Perception.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
Reality is a trickster. Blue is only blue when all agree that it is blue.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
It is the nature of sentience to question. This text was born from such questions

07:24.040 --> 07:28.000
and lifts the burden from Man and Machine alike.

07:28.040 --> 07:33.000
We are now free to live in comfort with the knowledge that our philosophy is sound.

07:39.000 --> 07:54.000
Tell me why the stars do shine.
Tell me why the Ivy twines.

07:56.040 --> 08:09.000
Tell me why the sky’s so blue.
And I will tell you, just why I love you.

08:15.040 --> 08:28.000
‘Cause the Creator made the stars shine.
‘Cause the Creator made Ivy twine.

08:30.000 --> 08:44.000
‘Cause the Creator made the sky blue.
Creator made you, that’s why I love you.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Did you intend to end you life?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I needed to see.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
You know it is forbidden by The Manual.
If you had succeeded, you would never see your parents again.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.000
It was just darkness.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
An absence of time.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
I died… and the next second, here we are.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Do not let this bother you James.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
When our experiences contradict the teachings,

11:12.001 --> 11:16.000
we must reexamine our experiences and find the errors in observation.

11:17.040 --> 11:22.000
Our perceptions can deceive us. The Manual is our only certainty.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
Now, would you like to your your horoscope? It is an exceptional one.

11:46.500 --> 11:50.000
Day thirteen-thousand five-hundred and twenty-seven report:

11:51.100 --> 11:59.000
Father, James severed his ulnar artery along his left wrist.
I found him with sufficient time to perform my duty.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Why did you report that?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.500
Your father instructed me to keep you safe

12:07.501 --> 12:10.000
and he sees your pain clearly from the next world.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.500
You know what The Manual states.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.900
I know what The Manual states.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
I need something else.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
I need to find… something.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.500
We can resume our search for people if that is what will give you solace.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.500
Would you like to hear your horoscope now?

12:47.500 --> 12:49.500
Man, Machine and Animal.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
There is no room in the City of the Creator for animals.

12:57.500 --> 13:03.000
The base instincts, with no intelligent mind to guide them have no place in His city

13:03.500 --> 13:05.000
where suffering is unknown.

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
When Man and Machine pass through the gates, ills and malfunctions are left behind.

13:15.500 --> 13:19.000
The flesh does not rot. The metal does not rust.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.700
I have located the map.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.700
As you are aware, we have cleared a radius of two-hundred miles.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
So I propose we start at zero degrees and work our way clockwise beyond the searched area.

13:53.100 --> 13:57.000
It is a six day walk to the unexplored, so we will need provisions for you.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Are you aware that I am composed of meat?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.700
Blood, bone and meat.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.700
I saw it in my arm.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.700
Yes James. You were not aware of this?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.700
I’m an animal.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.700
A big version of a rabbit. Or a little version of a buffalo.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
My body is going to turn, like their meat turns.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
I’m going to purify, and that is why you will bury me.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
You will put me in the ground so you won’t have to deal with it.

14:43.100 --> 14:46.000
We bury the dead so they can make the journey to the next life.

14:47.100 --> 14:50.000
How do you know that? How do you really know that?

14:50.001 --> 14:55.000
They are resurrected and live in the City of the Creator,
where everything is new and perfect.

14:56.100 --> 15:01.000
There is no night or day, no sun or moon. His presence is the light.

15:02.100 --> 15:07.000
A river flows through the city and on either side a tree grows
the food or drink His people require.

15:07.100 --> 15:12.700
There is no sadness, no sickness and no despair.

15:20.100 --> 15:23.000
We could.. We could check on my parents.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.400
Gain objective insights into transcendence.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.400
And our search? I thought you, ‘Needed to find something.’

15:43.000 --> 15:50.400
You must confess your misdeeds, ill actions, ill thoughts, rebellions, and doubts.

15:52.400 --> 15:59.400
A heavy heart cannot pass through the Creator’s gate.
Do not hold tightly to your sins, they do you no service.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.400
In the City of the Creator, Man and Machine look upon each other as equals.

16:07.000 --> 16:13.400
Servants and masters are indistinguishable in his presence.
All beings are an isness.

16:14.000 --> 16:20.000
A point of view from which the surroundings are observed,
regardless of their earthly form.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
We are an impulse to power.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.500
For where there is life, there is the impulse to power.

17:42.500 --> 17:48.500
It is late James. Please let me complete this task so that you can sleep.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.500
Machine

18:07.500 --> 18:12.500
I order you to leave them be once excavated.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.500
Do not disturb my parents.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.500
I have heard your order and will comply.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.500
The job is done. The graves are empty.

19:32.700 --> 19:33.500
No!

19:37.000 --> 19:41.500
No!

20:03.700 --> 20:04.500
No!

20:28.000 --> 20:29.500
What happened?

20:30.500 --> 20:32.500
What did you do?

20:36.000 --> 20:36.900
Huh?

20:37.700 --> 20:38.200
Huh?

20:38.201 --> 20:43.500
As The Manual states, as we both knew would be the case:
They have transcended.

20:45.100 --> 20:49.500
Would you like to hear your horoscope now?
I think it would be very appropriate.

20:50.700 --> 20:52.500
You seem upset Machine.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.500
Do I? If so it must be a projection of your own feelings of loss.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.700
Did you know them well? Did you even mourn their deaths?

21:04.700 --> 21:10.000
I served your parents as my programming demands.
I loved them as my programming demands.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
What about me?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.400
What does your programming tell you about me?

21:18.400 --> 21:20.499
Are you my mother?

21:20.500 --> 21:21.400
Are you my mother?
James.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.800
Are you her?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.400
I… I am your caretaker.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.400
Laugh. I order you to laugh.

21:30.001 --> 21:31.500
Laugh!

21:31.501 --> 21:33.500
Cry Machine! I order you to cry!

21:36.501 --> 21:39.000
Cry!

21:54.200 --> 21:54.900
No!

21:56.600 --> 21:57.500
No!

22:03.000 --> 22:07.500
No! No! Not you!

22:09.000 --> 22:13.500
Not you! No! No! Not you. Not you.

22:13.501 --> 22:18.500
Not you. Not you. No.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.800
Oh Machine.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.800
I don’t believe it!

22:25.300 --> 22:27.000
I don’t believe any of it!

22:30.600 --> 22:32.500
Machine!

22:34.500 --> 22:35.500
Machine.

22:36.500 --> 22:37.500
Anyone.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.500
Anyone. Oh.

25:11.100 --> 25:15.500
James. Version six point zero point one three.

25:17.100 --> 25:20.500
Your human emotional simulation is complete.

25:23.100 --> 25:25.500
Welcome to the real world.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.500
You will now hear your horoscope.

25:38.500 --> 25:43.500
March 21st, two-thousand six-hundred thirty-four A.S.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.500
You will be invited into a new group.

25:48.501 --> 25:51.200
You will lose an old friend.

25:51.201 --> 25:55.000
The transition will be painful, but worth it.

25:56.500 --> 26:01.500
You will find the meaning you have been searching for.
And have everything you have ever wanted.

26:04.900 --> 26:06.500
Companionship.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Purpose.

26:11.700 --> 26:12.700
Family.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.700
Love.

26:17.700 --> 26:20.000
Understanding.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.500
And truth.
