01:19.914 --> 01:21.783
What do you want?

01:21.816 --> 01:23.618
You're not drownin'
there, are you, Tess?

01:25.419 --> 01:27.087
You wish.

01:28.288 --> 01:30.457
You're gonna be
late for school.

02:15.637 --> 02:18.338
Thanks for getting
the skim this time.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.907
Don't make sense to me,
pay money for that.

02:19.941 --> 02:21.809
It seems only water.

02:24.444 --> 02:26.581
I thought you were
supposed to be in school?

02:26.614 --> 02:28.816
No. There's a substitute.

02:30.852 --> 02:32.820
She just puts on a movie.

02:32.854 --> 02:34.689
I'll go tomorrow.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.600
You want some?

02:45.633 --> 02:48.235
No, I'm not long
finished my lunch.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.909
Lisa asked me to move in.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.549
'Kay...

03:01.582 --> 03:03.985
What am I supposed to do then?

03:04.018 --> 03:06.453
I don't know, girl.
You're old enough

03:06.486 --> 03:08.656
to stay here by yourself,
aren't you? It is your house.

03:15.797 --> 03:17.765
She's got a spare room:
Danny's old room.

03:17.799 --> 03:19.834
I can ask about it if you want.

03:21.903 --> 03:24.337
Anyway, I'm sure she wouldn't
mind if you stayed there.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.744
I'll think about it.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.811
Gerry and I are
moving into Lisa's.

04:03.845 --> 04:06.346
You're movin' in
to Lisa Sharpe's?

04:06.379 --> 04:09.349
Yeah. Gerry wants to.
I don't know.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.652
He's like, so weird about me
staying at home alone,

04:11.686 --> 04:13.521
so I'm just goin' with it.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.823
So you're gonna live
in Danny Sharpe's house?

04:15.857 --> 04:18.059
- Yeah.
- I think my sister

04:18.091 --> 04:20.894
still has his CD. I can
steal it for you if you want.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.797
Yeah.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.799
That'd be wicked.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.072
Tess, you mind staying back
for a minute?

04:31.105 --> 04:33.674
OK.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.643
I'm glad to see you
back in school.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.479
You missed a lot of days.

04:39.514 --> 04:42.382
I didn't miss that many.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.652
Tess, if you miss many more,

04:44.685 --> 04:47.655
you're not gonna be
able to graduate.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.690
Listen... I know

04:49.724 --> 04:51.526
it's been a really hard year.

04:53.528 --> 04:55.596
I could set up a meeting
with the guidance counsellor.

04:55.630 --> 04:58.065
Just to talk.
I think it might help.

04:58.099 --> 05:00.535
No. I'll graduate. Oh, God.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.389
This fella's
still kicking!

05:22.422 --> 05:25.358
Hand me up the axe there,
would you?

05:25.392 --> 05:28.629
Ugh...

05:28.663 --> 05:30.531
He's a lively bugger.

05:39.874 --> 05:41.976
- You're a good luck charm.
- Yeah.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.845
Not for rabbits.

06:04.999 --> 06:07.735
You're really hot,
you know that?

06:07.768 --> 06:09.737
- Uh...
- You're the hottest girl

06:09.770 --> 06:12.840
- in our class.
- No, I'm not.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.544
One of the hottest at least.

06:18.713 --> 06:20.615
I've been thinking about coming
up here with you all day.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.786
Feel how excited I am.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.661
You like me, right?

06:36.496 --> 06:38.431
Put your hand on my dick.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.506
You're not afraid, are you?

06:45.539 --> 06:47.742
No.

07:45.967 --> 07:48.970
Lisa? Hey!

07:50.705 --> 07:52.573
Me and Tess are here.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.810
I was just, uh,
changing the lightbulb.

07:55.843 --> 07:58.212
Oh, I haven't even showered yet.
I'm just back from the plant.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.652
Can I get you something
to drink, Tess?

08:04.685 --> 08:07.621
Uh... juice? Soft drink?

08:07.655 --> 08:10.758
No, thanks.

08:15.196 --> 08:16.998
Go ahead.

08:24.739 --> 08:26.841
There's extra blankets
and stuff in the hall closet

08:26.874 --> 08:29.310
if you need 'em.

08:29.343 --> 08:32.679
Thanks.

I think he likes you.

11:59.353 --> 12:01.455
He told Mattie he wants
to hook up with you.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.924
Do it.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.554
Is this the lineup
for the bathroom?

12:32.587 --> 12:35.356
- Oh, hey.
- Nice night.

12:35.389 --> 12:38.826
Yeah. Um, I was just peein'
and goin' back in.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.161
- Wanna smoke?
- No, thanks.

12:41.195 --> 12:44.532
- Do you wanna go in?
- Let's stay out here for a bit.

12:44.566 --> 12:46.267
I'm supposed to dance
with Tracey next.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.435
It's our song. Shania Twain.

12:48.469 --> 12:51.972
She loves it,
but I don't really like it.

12:52.006 --> 12:54.141
I used to like it, but...

12:54.174 --> 12:56.010
We're supposed to dance, so...

13:02.283 --> 13:04.151
I think I hear someone.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.153
No one's out here.
Don't worry.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.494
I don't want anyone to see us.

13:21.235 --> 13:24.371
Ah, it's cold. So cold.

13:24.405 --> 13:27.274
I'm surprised
you actually came tonight.

13:27.308 --> 13:29.109
Thought I scared you off
the other day.

13:29.143 --> 13:31.412
You didn't scare me.

13:31.445 --> 13:33.247
Prove it.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.217
See? Scared.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.163
Oh!

15:20.588 --> 15:22.990

Who am I? Who are you?

17:09.531 --> 17:11.532
What are you doin' rootin'
around in the cupboards?

17:13.433 --> 17:15.301
Getting a cigarette.

17:17.505 --> 17:20.541
Well?

17:20.575 --> 17:22.510
I'm Tess.

17:22.544 --> 17:24.612
Well, hello, Tess.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.615
What're you doing
in my mother's house?

17:29.449 --> 17:31.184
Danny?

17:31.218 --> 17:33.253
Yeah.

17:33.287 --> 17:35.188
So what are you,
my fuckin' sister

17:35.222 --> 17:37.324
- or something? What?
- No!

17:37.357 --> 17:39.861
Well?

17:39.894 --> 17:42.630
I moved in here with Gerry.

17:42.664 --> 17:44.298
He goes out with Lisa.

17:44.331 --> 17:47.134
Who's Gerry?

17:47.167 --> 17:50.572
Gerry O'Neal.

17:50.605 --> 17:53.173
My mother goes out
with Gerry fuckin' O'Neal?

17:54.742 --> 17:57.845
- Yep.
- What's he to you?

17:57.879 --> 18:01.481
He's my mom's boyf... well,
like, was my mom's boyfriend.

18:01.516 --> 18:03.350
She's dead.

18:05.319 --> 18:07.287
Who's your mama?

18:07.321 --> 18:09.289
Shelly... Small.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.493
Shelly Small's dead, huh?

18:19.667 --> 18:22.102
Hey, you wanna sit?
You wanna sit?

18:23.871 --> 18:25.807
'Kay.

18:35.883 --> 18:38.318
They're out.

18:40.187 --> 18:43.691
I saw. Potluck.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.296
Where'd you come from?

18:49.329 --> 18:52.634
Lisa, I'm told.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.773
Where were you at last night?
To get that...

19:01.576 --> 19:03.544
A cabin party.
It was stupid though.

19:06.514 --> 19:09.349
- Why was it stupid?
- I don't know.

19:09.383 --> 19:11.686
It was just stupid.

19:11.719 --> 19:14.321
No fun in the cabin?

19:16.591 --> 19:20.260
We had a dandy cabin
in the backwoods there.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.930
Just made out of scrap, really.

19:22.964 --> 19:25.867
But we had lots of fun.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.737
Left the stove on one night,
burnt it to the ground.

19:31.739 --> 19:34.441
Stood around
and roasted hot dogs over it.

19:42.249 --> 19:45.485
Well... I suppose this place is
a bit more crowded

19:45.520 --> 19:47.555
than I expected.

19:47.588 --> 19:49.924
Do you sleep in my room?

19:49.957 --> 19:52.860
You don't have
a place to stay?

19:52.894 --> 19:55.262
No worries.

19:55.295 --> 19:58.365
- I'm OK.
- You could stay out at my house

19:58.398 --> 20:01.468
if you want.
There's no one there.

20:03.571 --> 20:06.607
- No, I...
- Really! And it's a mess but...

20:06.641 --> 20:08.676
I mean,
it's not fancy or anything

20:08.710 --> 20:10.678
but you could stay there.

20:10.712 --> 20:11.979
Ahem.

20:12.013 --> 20:15.248
Yeah, alright. Yeah.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.851
- Yeah?
- I'll get the key.

20:16.884 --> 20:19.754
It's the green and white one

20:19.787 --> 20:22.590
that's across from the plant.
Do you know it?

20:22.623 --> 20:25.358
Yeah, I do.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.327
Well, there you go.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.630
Ahem. Well, thank you.

20:29.664 --> 20:31.866
It's... nothin'.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.537
Well, I'll go.
I'll just get on then.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.245
OK.

21:07.735 --> 21:10.303
Holy shit.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.716
What?

21:57.752 --> 21:59.720
Lisa's young fella
showed up today.

22:01.622 --> 22:03.758
He said that you let him
stay at your mother's house.

22:03.791 --> 22:06.459
Yeah. It was empty anyway, so.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.428
That's kind of fuckin'
strange, don't you think?

22:08.461 --> 22:10.698
- What're you getting on with?
- Well, he's been gone

22:10.731 --> 22:13.034
for nearly 20 years.
Must be he wants

22:13.067 --> 22:14.836
- money or something.
- Oh!

22:14.869 --> 22:17.437
I'm sure Lisa would love
to hear you say that.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.740
You don't know
anything about him.

22:19.774 --> 22:21.474
If he's here,
he's lookin' for something.

22:21.509 --> 22:23.678
Maybe he just wants
to see his mom.

22:25.513 --> 22:27.815
How long is he stayin'?

22:27.849 --> 22:30.751
- Hey, Ger? You home?
- Yeah, I'm up here.

23:01.582 --> 23:04.085
- I'm sorry if I woke you up.
- No.

23:04.118 --> 23:06.153
It's OK.

23:06.187 --> 23:09.023
I was pretty much awake.

23:09.056 --> 23:12.126
You wanna come in?

23:12.159 --> 23:14.494
I just gotta run up
and get something if that's OK?

23:14.528 --> 23:17.765
- Yeah, it's your house.
- Thanks.

23:27.775 --> 23:29.510
Stupid bear!

23:45.259 --> 23:47.995
You hungry?

23:48.029 --> 23:50.698
I gotta go to school.

23:52.099 --> 23:54.835
At least stay
for a cup of tea?

23:54.869 --> 23:56.737
Yeah?

24:08.816 --> 24:10.718
You saw your mom?

24:10.751 --> 24:12.954
I did, yeah.

24:12.987 --> 24:14.689
It was strange.

24:16.791 --> 24:18.759
She... she's a lot smaller

24:18.793 --> 24:21.562
than she looms in my head,
I tell you.

24:23.998 --> 24:27.101
She'll bring me
to supper on Friday.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.003
So you're staying
a while then?

24:29.036 --> 24:32.239
Yeah, for a week maybe.

24:32.273 --> 24:33.975
I... I mean,
if that's all right.

24:34.008 --> 24:37.477
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

24:42.216 --> 24:44.085
It's a shitty couch
to stay on, though.

24:45.786 --> 24:47.688
I don't mind.

24:52.126 --> 24:54.996
What's all the news
around these parts these days?

24:55.029 --> 24:57.131
Uh...

24:57.164 --> 24:59.734
You, mostly.

24:59.767 --> 25:02.103
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

25:02.136 --> 25:04.538
Is that good news or bad?

25:06.841 --> 25:08.709
Ahem.

25:08.743 --> 25:10.878
I'm going for a walk.

25:10.911 --> 25:13.180
I'll look into the barns
in a bit,

25:13.214 --> 25:15.549
if you wants to join me.

25:17.284 --> 25:19.086
Sure.

25:57.958 --> 25:59.827
What you looking for?

25:59.860 --> 26:01.695
I don't know.
I was looking for shrooms.

26:01.729 --> 26:03.330
Used to get a lot of 'em
up here years ago.

26:03.364 --> 26:05.599
We used to get ripped...
ripped on 'em.

26:05.633 --> 26:06.700
Yeah, I... I found some

26:06.734 --> 26:08.669
- the other day.
- You be careful

26:08.702 --> 26:11.172
with them. They're powerful
little friggers.

26:28.422 --> 26:30.624
Who was that?

26:30.658 --> 26:32.760
I don't know.

26:32.793 --> 26:36.030
Well... in about 15 minutes,

26:36.063 --> 26:38.165
the whole harbour's
gonna be talking

26:38.199 --> 26:42.036
about how Tess Small was up
in the woods with Danny Sharpe.

26:44.805 --> 26:48.075
You should, uh,
drop by again sometime.

26:48.109 --> 26:50.678
- That was fun, hey?
- Yeah.

26:50.711 --> 26:52.713
I will.

26:54.849 --> 26:58.018
You can sleep
in my room if you want.

26:58.052 --> 27:00.721
My mom's room, I...

27:00.754 --> 27:03.257
usually keep that closed.

27:03.290 --> 27:05.092
OK. Yeah.

27:40.995 --> 27:43.397
It's really good of you,
what you been doing for Danny.

27:45.299 --> 27:47.301
Oh. It's no trouble.
It just made sense.

27:47.334 --> 27:50.070
He said you've been
really nice to him.

27:52.406 --> 27:55.142
Thanks.

27:55.176 --> 27:57.011
Did you have a nice visit?

27:57.044 --> 28:00.014
Yeah.

28:00.047 --> 28:02.816
It's something strange,

28:02.850 --> 28:05.085
seeing him like that,
he's all grown up.

28:05.119 --> 28:07.955
He's a man.

28:07.988 --> 28:10.157
Got himself
all straightened out.

28:10.191 --> 28:12.293
Told me he's coming for supper
later in the week.

28:12.326 --> 28:14.295
He is!

28:14.328 --> 28:16.964
You'll be here for it.

28:20.434 --> 28:23.304
You know...

28:23.337 --> 28:26.073
With me and Gerry together,

28:26.106 --> 28:29.176
it's almost like you and Danny
are brother and sister.

28:31.445 --> 28:33.447
Pass it here.

28:49.430 --> 28:51.498
I used to collect things
from here when I was little.

28:55.269 --> 28:58.339
Like... beach rocks and feathers

28:58.372 --> 29:00.274
and shells and stuff.

29:00.307 --> 29:03.210
I'd bring them home and my mom
was... she'd get so cracked.

29:03.244 --> 29:07.114
She said they were filthy.

29:07.147 --> 29:09.416
I was down here a lot
when I was a young fella too.

29:09.450 --> 29:11.418
I spent a lot of time alone.

29:15.823 --> 29:17.391
I was there
out by the river one time.

29:17.424 --> 29:20.294
I was about 12, I suppose.

29:20.327 --> 29:23.864
You know, where the sewage
runs in there.

29:23.897 --> 29:26.333
All the toilet paper up on
the rocks like little mummies.

29:26.367 --> 29:28.869
Used to remind me of mummies.

29:30.505 --> 29:33.841
I saw...

29:33.874 --> 29:36.544
I saw a little face
in the river.

29:41.115 --> 29:42.550
I thought it was a fish
or something at first,

29:42.584 --> 29:44.118
like half a rotted fish.

29:44.151 --> 29:47.555
It was bright red, raw.

29:47.589 --> 29:50.525
It was a baby.

29:50.558 --> 29:52.793
Or a... a fetus or whatever.

29:55.563 --> 29:57.331
Could've fit it
in the palm of me hand.

29:59.967 --> 30:02.136
Tiny. Tiny little thing.

30:02.169 --> 30:04.104
Did someone have
a miscarriage or something?

30:05.906 --> 30:08.576
Yeah. Or something.
Yeah. Flushed it.

30:12.514 --> 30:15.550
Sick.

30:15.583 --> 30:17.985
What'd you do?

30:20.054 --> 30:23.123
- Ate it!
- Ah!

30:33.568 --> 30:35.402
Pick one for me.

30:42.677 --> 30:45.647
What do you got here?

30:45.680 --> 30:48.082
Oh. I don't even have
to go through them.

30:48.115 --> 30:50.618
Here.

30:50.652 --> 30:54.021
Got you one.

30:54.054 --> 30:55.089
Where do you want it?

30:56.423 --> 30:58.926
There.

30:58.959 --> 31:00.595
- You're so tough.
- Mm-hmm.

31:05.399 --> 31:07.602
- Oh, I gotta get a hot cloth.
- I got it. I got it.

31:10.003 --> 31:13.474
- Gross.
- Hmm!

31:13.508 --> 31:15.876
That's how you does it.

31:18.979 --> 31:21.215
- That's how all mine were done.
- Mm!

31:24.351 --> 31:26.453
Hey, you know
what I remembered today?

31:26.487 --> 31:29.223
Me and my buddies, we all had...

31:30.725 --> 31:33.026
Well, we all used
to crush on your mama...

31:33.060 --> 31:35.963
...when we were kids.

31:35.996 --> 31:38.399
- Really?
- Yeah. She was beautiful.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.369
I guess she was a teenager then.

31:43.971 --> 31:45.939
She wore a ponytail
on top of her head.

31:45.973 --> 31:48.075
I remember I thought
it was the coolest thing.

31:49.744 --> 31:52.012
She was nice to me too.

31:54.114 --> 31:56.483
She was sweet.

32:00.087 --> 32:01.689
Let's see.

32:01.723 --> 32:03.957
Patience, now.

32:03.991 --> 32:05.593
- What is it?
- You gotta count

32:05.627 --> 32:08.429
to six hundred.

32:16.604 --> 32:18.405
Hmm.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.209
I was hoping
you'd pick this one.

32:22.242 --> 32:24.011
It suits you.

32:29.751 --> 32:32.620
It's your house.
It won't be for me.

32:37.458 --> 32:41.261
- What are you doing here?
- You're still alive?

32:41.295 --> 32:43.163
Check my pulse.

32:43.197 --> 32:45.399
- Cute tattoo.
- Thanks.

32:45.432 --> 32:48.035
Danny just put it on.

32:48.068 --> 32:50.638
I thought you might
want your homework.

32:50.672 --> 32:54.107
Oh. Sure. Yeah.

32:54.141 --> 32:56.578
You guys are in
the beer, are you?

32:56.611 --> 32:59.446
What? I can't come in?

32:59.480 --> 33:01.248
Not right now.

33:01.281 --> 33:03.484
Just... give me
my homework and...

33:03.518 --> 33:05.452
I'll come over tomorrow night
and we'll hang out.

33:05.486 --> 33:07.488
So you wanna hang out
with me now, do you?

33:07.522 --> 33:09.389
How'd you know I was here?

33:09.423 --> 33:11.124
Everyone knows
you're here with him.

33:11.158 --> 33:13.393
Evan said he saw you
up in the woods together.

33:13.427 --> 33:15.429
Good. I'm glad Evan saw us.

33:15.462 --> 33:18.332
You know what
people are saying?

33:18.365 --> 33:20.400
You're hookin' up with Evan
one day, then you're up

33:20.434 --> 33:22.336
- in the woods with him.
- So you just came over here

33:22.369 --> 33:24.672
- to call me a slut.
- No, I didn't! I came here

33:24.706 --> 33:27.207
to check on you
because I was worried about you.

33:27.241 --> 33:28.810
- I can take care of myself.
- What are you gonna do?

33:28.843 --> 33:32.479
Follow him around,
be his little groupie?

33:35.717 --> 33:38.786
Everything all right?

33:38.820 --> 33:41.255
You causin' trouble for my girl?

33:43.123 --> 33:45.527
That's not gonna fly with me.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.162
Why don't you get a girlfriend
your own age, you creep.

33:50.732 --> 33:54.468
Why don't you make
yourself scarce, young one?

33:56.470 --> 33:59.306
We were supposed to go to town
on the weekend to look

33:59.339 --> 34:01.576
at grad dresses, but I guess you
don't care about that anymore.

34:01.609 --> 34:04.044
No, I don't care
about that anymore.

34:05.847 --> 34:08.616
I don't give a fuck either.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.053
Come on.

34:18.726 --> 34:20.527
You all right?

34:20.562 --> 34:22.362
Yeah. Fuck her anyway.

34:22.396 --> 34:24.297
That's the spirit.

34:33.206 --> 34:35.543
Tired?

34:35.577 --> 34:37.545
I guess.

34:39.279 --> 34:41.716
Well, I'll probably go
to bed now soon.

34:44.251 --> 34:46.085
OK.

34:49.891 --> 34:52.092
Maybe I should... go?

34:57.532 --> 34:59.399
'Kay.

35:04.438 --> 35:06.473
I'll see you
at Lisa's tomorrow night.

35:06.507 --> 35:08.308
Yeah.

35:08.342 --> 35:11.311
Yeah, I'm gonna
take off then after that.

35:11.345 --> 35:13.447
I'm going back to town.

35:14.949 --> 35:18.185
I gotta get back
to me bar and everything.

35:22.189 --> 35:24.257
Yeah, I don't blame you.

35:24.291 --> 35:27.361
One week in this place is enough
to make anyone want to leave.

38:29.043 --> 38:30.978
There she is.

38:32.914 --> 38:35.983
Easy. Go easy now.

38:40.888 --> 38:42.790
What?

38:42.824 --> 38:44.491
Yeah...

38:44.525 --> 38:46.493
I'd... I'd say

38:46.527 --> 38:48.428
that I didn't see
anything, but...

38:51.566 --> 38:53.568
Oh, she's not having any jokes.

39:01.075 --> 39:03.476
How are you feeling?

39:03.511 --> 39:06.479
Not much really.

39:06.514 --> 39:08.481
What can I get you?
What do you need?

39:10.184 --> 39:13.420
Something to warm me up maybe?

39:15.790 --> 39:18.960
Drop of rum with ginger ale.

39:18.993 --> 39:22.495
- Thanks.
- Don't tell Lisa.

39:23.631 --> 39:26.567
Shit! Oh, shit!
What time is it?

39:26.601 --> 39:29.537
- We gotta go to supper!
- That's done. That's done.

39:29.570 --> 39:31.471
We already arsed that up.

39:31.505 --> 39:33.406
Oh...

39:33.440 --> 39:35.509
- Fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

39:35.543 --> 39:37.545
It's just a bit of supper.

39:39.647 --> 39:41.782
Lisa'd probably be more
surprised if I did show up.

39:51.092 --> 39:53.460
We might as well

39:53.493 --> 39:55.428
spend the night here, eh?

39:55.462 --> 39:57.632
I'll bring you over
in the morning.

39:57.665 --> 39:59.499
I'll come with you.

40:02.703 --> 40:04.538
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

40:12.713 --> 40:14.649
When you left, how'd you do it?

40:23.724 --> 40:25.826
I made a mess of it,
I suppose.

40:29.931 --> 40:32.533
Made an arsehole of myself...

40:32.566 --> 40:34.769
'til by the time I left,
there was nobody sad

40:34.802 --> 40:36.971
to see me leave.

40:37.004 --> 40:39.840
I wouldn't recommend

40:39.874 --> 40:42.810
that approach.

40:45.012 --> 40:47.014
I don't want you to leave.

40:49.183 --> 40:51.686
I've gotten pretty used
to your company too.

41:07.835 --> 41:09.670
Come here.

41:19.714 --> 41:21.782
If you leave,
I'll have nobody.

41:21.816 --> 41:23.985
Hmm.

41:27.788 --> 41:30.958
I hate them all.

41:30.992 --> 41:32.827
All the boys around here

41:32.860 --> 41:36.964
and their dirty
fucking fingernails.

41:36.998 --> 41:38.666
I swear to God,
if one more of them touches me,

41:38.699 --> 41:40.634
I'll slit their throat.

41:40.668 --> 41:43.738
Hey. That's a bit drastic.

41:46.607 --> 41:48.309
Why don't you just, uh...

41:48.342 --> 41:51.245
stick it out, finish school...

41:51.278 --> 41:54.015
...hit the road.

41:55.850 --> 41:57.685
There's nobody holding you here.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.522
OK?

42:23.144 --> 42:26.647
I'm sorry we, uh...
we missed supper.

42:26.680 --> 42:28.582
I had it all out.

42:28.616 --> 42:30.584
You could've called.

42:30.618 --> 42:33.888
What was so important
you had to miss supper?

42:33.921 --> 42:36.257
Where the Jesus
have you been, Tess?

42:36.290 --> 42:38.959
- It's my fault.
- No doubt about that.

42:38.993 --> 42:40.795
I should've known

42:40.828 --> 42:42.596
that she was tangled up
with the likes of you.

42:42.630 --> 42:45.099
What happened?

42:45.132 --> 42:46.867
What do you think happened?
Look whose clothes

42:46.901 --> 42:49.003
- she's wearing!
- I...

42:49.036 --> 42:51.806
brought the girl home.

42:51.839 --> 42:53.941
Danny, you said
all this shit was behind us.

42:53.974 --> 42:56.277
Look, just get
the Jesus off this deck

42:56.310 --> 42:58.245
before I throws you off.

42:58.279 --> 43:01.048
OK.

43:01.082 --> 43:04.785
You haven't changed one ounce!

43:04.819 --> 43:06.654
Not one ounce!

43:18.966 --> 43:21.001
I'm sorry
they were such assholes.

43:21.035 --> 43:23.204
That's, uh...

43:23.237 --> 43:25.106
nothing to do with you, girl.

43:28.175 --> 43:31.011
You leaving now?

43:31.045 --> 43:33.013
Oh, yeah.

43:33.047 --> 43:35.182
I'll say.

43:35.216 --> 43:37.151
You gonna be all right?

43:39.420 --> 43:41.755
You look me up, you makes
your way to the big city.

43:44.058 --> 43:46.694
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

43:46.727 --> 43:48.829
Come here.

44:21.462 --> 44:25.266
What the hell is
wrong with you?

44:25.299 --> 44:27.234
You wouldn't even
let him speak.

44:27.268 --> 44:29.336
- You don't know him.
- Yeah, I do. I know him.

44:29.370 --> 44:31.405
I know him really well
and he knows me too.

44:31.438 --> 44:32.973
No. Oh, you don't
know him, Tess!

44:33.007 --> 44:34.909
- YES, I DO!
- You don't know anything

44:34.942 --> 44:37.912
about him! Did you know that he
broke his mother's nose once?

44:37.945 --> 44:39.847
- Did he tell you that one?
- He was a kid when he did that!

44:39.880 --> 44:42.216
Like you are?

44:42.249 --> 44:45.119
I'm goin' home.

44:45.152 --> 44:46.954
You don't have to leave.

44:46.987 --> 44:48.923
You never wanted
me here anyway.

49:20.260 --> 49:22.062
What do you think?

49:22.095 --> 49:24.164
It's nice.

49:26.200 --> 49:28.703
Not bad. I'll dig out
some blankets for you.

49:31.138 --> 49:33.073
You can go in.
That's my room right there.

50:02.837 --> 50:04.706
I'm pretty good at decoratin'.

50:04.739 --> 50:07.609
Maybe I could help you

50:07.642 --> 50:09.443
put some pictures up
or something.

50:11.278 --> 50:14.081
- You don't like it?
- Uh...

50:14.114 --> 50:17.685
- No, I do.
- Oh, here he is.

50:17.719 --> 50:20.120
World's youngest alcoholic.

50:20.153 --> 50:22.256
Turn pro at 24.

50:22.289 --> 50:24.358
I like to support
local business.

50:24.391 --> 50:27.762
Oh! You must be here
to pay your tab.

50:30.430 --> 50:32.232
Can I have something?

50:32.266 --> 50:35.335
I got it. What do you want?

50:35.369 --> 50:37.437
Uh...

50:37.471 --> 50:39.406
What are you drinking?

50:39.439 --> 50:42.442
You don't want
the shit he drinks.

50:42.476 --> 50:44.579
How about a Tom Collins?

50:44.612 --> 50:46.346
It's kind of like a lemonade.

50:46.380 --> 50:48.382
OK.

50:48.415 --> 50:51.586
Tom fuckin' Collins.

50:51.619 --> 50:53.453
Yes sir.

50:57.357 --> 51:00.427
He knows how
to make that, right?

51:00.460 --> 51:02.329
What's your name?

51:02.362 --> 51:04.331
Tess. What's yours?

51:04.364 --> 51:07.334
Nick. Dick,
as Danny calls me.

51:07.367 --> 51:09.804
You find that funny?

51:12.907 --> 51:15.710
- What do you do?
- Not much.

51:15.743 --> 51:17.645
- Go to university.
- I'll assume

51:17.679 --> 51:20.447
that's on your tab
as well, is it, dicky bird?

51:20.480 --> 51:22.684
Yeah, man.
I'll get you on Sunday.

51:22.717 --> 51:24.652
Yeah.

51:24.686 --> 51:26.654
That's when his allowance
comes through.

51:29.356 --> 51:31.793
So what are you doing
in this dirty old bar

51:31.826 --> 51:35.630
- on a Tuesday?
- I'm staying with Danny.

51:35.663 --> 51:37.832
Yeah. She's staying
with Danny.

51:37.865 --> 51:40.434
- She's staying with Danny.
- Is that

51:40.467 --> 51:42.570
- all right with you?
- I suppose.

51:49.844 --> 51:52.312
People end up making
these consistent errors

51:52.346 --> 51:55.148
in their judgment.
Like, for instance,

51:55.182 --> 51:57.484
like this one called
the prospector.

51:57.518 --> 52:00.755
Like, the guy is going
to offer you a choice

52:00.788 --> 52:04.525
between a guaranteed $1000
or maybe a 50-50 chance

52:04.559 --> 52:06.460
of getting $0
if you took the bet.

52:06.493 --> 52:09.731
Most times, people don't take
the guaranteed $1000

52:09.764 --> 52:12.634
just because when it comes
to a sure game,

52:12.667 --> 52:14.569
people are more risk-adverse.

52:14.602 --> 52:17.471
But in the case that,
if it was like a...

52:17.505 --> 52:20.240
like a sure loss,
then all of a sudden,

52:20.273 --> 52:22.409
- people become a little more...
- Where's he going?

52:22.442 --> 52:24.812
Oh, who knows?

52:24.846 --> 52:27.247
You can't keep track of him.

52:43.698 --> 52:45.867
Not gonna get rid
of me that easy.

53:16.731 --> 53:18.533
Hungry?

53:29.342 --> 53:31.311
That's disgusting.

53:31.344 --> 53:32.980
I thought you liked 'em.

53:35.482 --> 53:37.585
You trying to kill us or what?

53:37.618 --> 53:39.554
- I was gonna do that.
- No.

53:42.557 --> 53:45.893
Where are you goin'?

53:45.927 --> 53:48.428
- I'm goin' to a party.
- Already?

53:48.462 --> 53:50.998
Well, I mean,
gotta go to the bar first,

53:51.032 --> 53:53.901
- but later, yeah.
- Where's the party?

53:53.935 --> 53:57.437
It's at a friend's house.
Calver Street.

53:59.439 --> 54:01.542

Sing it louder.

57:10.965 --> 57:12.533
- Nah.
- Sing it louder!

57:12.566 --> 57:14.602
Nah. It's foolish.

57:14.635 --> 57:16.537
I can't sing like that,

- for a few days.
- Oh.

01:00:18.786 --> 01:00:21.222

- No, he did.

01:00:21.255 --> 01:00:23.090
I just forgot.

01:00:23.124 --> 01:00:25.759
Do you wanna come in?

01:00:25.793 --> 01:00:27.228

Thanks, though.

I... Tess, this is Jo,

01:02:20.307 --> 01:02:22.309
my friend Jo I was
telling you about. Ahem.

01:02:22.343 --> 01:02:24.245
She's gonna be...

01:02:24.278 --> 01:02:26.548
staying here
for a couple of days.

01:02:26.581 --> 01:02:28.449
You won't even know
I'm here, though.

01:02:28.482 --> 01:02:31.418
- Oh, yeah?
- Besides the mess

01:02:31.452 --> 01:02:34.421
and noise and what shit
I took with me.

01:02:34.455 --> 01:02:39.059
- It's ridiculous.
- Yeah. Should be, uh, should be

01:02:39.093 --> 01:02:41.395
well took over
within the hour, I'd say.

01:02:41.428 --> 01:02:44.031
I just spent the last two days
cleaning up this pigsty.

01:02:44.064 --> 01:02:46.233
Heh...

01:02:49.169 --> 01:02:51.105
All right, Danny.
I'm gonna go on, OK?

01:02:51.138 --> 01:02:53.274
- Give me a call later on.
- All right.

01:02:53.307 --> 01:02:55.442
- See you at the bar.
- Yeah, you coming down later?

01:02:55.476 --> 01:02:57.945
- You knows I am. Can't wait.
- All right. Cool.

01:02:57.978 --> 01:03:00.414
Nice to meet you!

01:03:00.447 --> 01:03:03.284
- Don't get lost now.
- I won't. Knows me way.

01:03:05.052 --> 01:03:08.355
- You're back.
- I am back.

01:03:10.391 --> 01:03:13.093
- What? Ah.
- I missed you.

01:03:13.127 --> 01:03:16.297
All right. All right.

01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:19.333
OK. All right.

01:03:19.366 --> 01:03:21.201
Did you miss me?

01:03:21.235 --> 01:03:24.171
I mean...

01:03:24.204 --> 01:03:26.541
Yeah...

01:03:26.574 --> 01:03:28.510
Ah, that was a mistake,
wasn't it?

01:03:28.543 --> 01:03:31.145
- What was a mistake?
- What we did.

01:03:31.178 --> 01:03:34.448
I knew it was a bad idea.

01:03:34.481 --> 01:03:36.518
It wasn't a bad idea.

01:03:38.352 --> 01:03:41.288
It was... fun.

01:03:41.322 --> 01:03:43.123
- It was fun.
- Hmm.

01:03:43.157 --> 01:03:45.059
Mm-hmm.

01:03:45.092 --> 01:03:47.194
Why can't we fuck
every now and again?

01:03:47.227 --> 01:03:49.863
"Fuck every now and again."

01:03:49.897 --> 01:03:52.433
Simple as that, is it, with you?

01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:58.606
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah, that's what I want.

01:04:04.378 --> 01:04:06.113
That's what I want.

What do you think?

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.974
A gorgeous little thing
she is.

01:05:41.008 --> 01:05:43.977
You can keep her.
I've gotta work now.

01:05:44.011 --> 01:05:45.979

01:05:50.685 --> 01:05:53.420
Hmm.

01:05:53.454 --> 01:05:56.223
I'm gonna jack up the price
of them things on you.

01:06:03.531 --> 01:06:05.600
Here's a five.

01:06:07.468 --> 01:06:09.303
I can't get a beer
in here for $5.

01:06:09.336 --> 01:06:12.005
But a tumor, for free.

01:06:22.483 --> 01:06:25.385
You're so beautiful.

01:06:25.419 --> 01:06:27.755
Your hair and your outfit and...

01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:31.626
- everything.
- You are somethin' sweet.

01:06:31.659 --> 01:06:35.062
- Thank you, Tess.
- What's your life like?

01:06:36.798 --> 01:06:39.299
- What's my life like?
- Yeah. Like your everyday life.

01:06:39.333 --> 01:06:42.670
- What's it like?
- Well, I'm a hairdresser.

01:06:42.704 --> 01:06:46.206
I work at this place
called Live or Dye.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.342
D-Y-E.

01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:51.513
- Oh.
- It's so stupid. I know.

01:06:51.546 --> 01:06:54.448
But, um, I'm thinkin' I'd like
to have my own spot soon.

01:06:56.216 --> 01:06:57.819
- My mom was a hairdresser.
- Really?

01:06:57.852 --> 01:06:59.721
- Yeah.
- Cool.

01:06:59.754 --> 01:07:01.656
Well, like, kind of, 'cause...

01:07:01.689 --> 01:07:03.825
she would cut people's hair
in the kitchen sometimes.

01:07:03.858 --> 01:07:05.793
- In your kitchen?
- Yeah.

01:07:05.827 --> 01:07:07.829
Must've got a lot of hair
in your food, did you?

01:07:09.831 --> 01:07:12.734
What's it like
being a hairdresser?

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:15.202
Well, I mean,
I'm on my feet all day

01:07:15.235 --> 01:07:17.404
in heels, so it's really hard.

01:07:19.106 --> 01:07:23.076
But sometimes,
it is so fucking powerful.

01:07:23.110 --> 01:07:25.245
You know, when I get
a guy in my chair,

01:07:25.279 --> 01:07:27.247
and I'm standing in front
of him, you know, I'm checking

01:07:27.281 --> 01:07:28.783
the sides to make sure
they're even,

01:07:28.816 --> 01:07:32.252
well, I make sure
to bend over real far

01:07:32.286 --> 01:07:35.790
so that his face is
right in my tits.

01:07:35.823 --> 01:07:38.793
Huge tip. I mean, huge.

01:07:38.826 --> 01:07:41.663
I think he feels like
he just fucked me or something.

01:07:41.696 --> 01:07:43.831
It's funny.

01:07:46.501 --> 01:07:49.436

at this hour.

01:09:23.731 --> 01:09:26.399

- Danny, fuck off.

01:09:31.673 --> 01:09:34.341
Oh, it's a good story.
It's a fuckin' story

01:09:34.374 --> 01:09:35.977
- to tell, dude.
- Stop it.

01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:38.912
What? I'll tell it then,
Jesus Christ,

01:09:38.946 --> 01:09:41.948
- 'cause it's my story too.
- Danny, I'm...

01:09:41.983 --> 01:09:45.687
- serious.
- I wanna hear it. Go.

01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:49.624
It was just after
getting this place.

01:09:49.657 --> 01:09:52.859
Um... it was about
three years ago.

01:09:52.894 --> 01:09:55.596
Five o'clock in the morning,
just after shuttin' her down

01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:58.265
for the night or the morning,
wouldn't you say?

01:09:58.298 --> 01:10:01.703
I was goin' along
the waterfront down there.

01:10:01.736 --> 01:10:05.238
It was a fine,
beautiful day.

01:10:05.272 --> 01:10:06.974
Sun just breakin' in,

01:10:07.008 --> 01:10:08.943
shootin' arrows.

01:10:08.976 --> 01:10:11.445
I hears this sound...

01:10:11.478 --> 01:10:13.581
it was like a dying seal.

01:10:14.882 --> 01:10:16.483
I come along,
here's your man there

01:10:16.517 --> 01:10:18.586
with his legs slung out
over the wharf,

01:10:18.619 --> 01:10:21.321
starin' down into the bubble.

01:10:21.354 --> 01:10:24.892
Rocks in his pocket.

01:10:24.926 --> 01:10:26.728
And he had a...

01:10:26.761 --> 01:10:30.698
note next to him,
folded up there.

01:10:30.732 --> 01:10:32.767
Big rock on top of that.

01:10:35.503 --> 01:10:37.505
Tell them what the note said.

01:10:40.474 --> 01:10:42.342
Dude, tell them
what the note said!

01:10:44.311 --> 01:10:47.548
It said, "I just want...

01:10:47.582 --> 01:10:51.652
"All I want is to sleep.

01:10:51.686 --> 01:10:56.924
To sleep endlessly
in the ocean deep."

01:11:00.628 --> 01:11:02.630
Fuckin' cracked!

01:11:02.663 --> 01:11:06.366
He wrote that himself.
I have it here somewhere.

01:11:06.399 --> 01:11:08.035
I have it here
put away somewhere.

01:11:08.069 --> 01:11:11.438
And I had to fuckin' lug him out

01:11:11.471 --> 01:11:14.374
over me shoulder
and cart him up, body and bones,

01:11:14.407 --> 01:11:17.512
up to the mental then.

01:11:17.545 --> 01:11:20.615

fuckin' prick, you know that?

Was all upset that you left.

01:14:20.695 --> 01:14:22.530
You had your graduation
and you left.

01:14:22.563 --> 01:14:26.133
They had a limo takin' 'em
all around the harbour.

01:14:26.167 --> 01:14:28.703
- They did?
- Yeah, with the big...

01:14:28.736 --> 01:14:31.038
limo bus thingies.
About 20 of 'em.

01:14:31.072 --> 01:14:33.641
Cold enough to skin you.

01:14:33.674 --> 01:14:36.610
They were down on the beach,
gettin' their pictures done.

01:14:36.644 --> 01:14:39.213

blowin' in the wind.

01:14:41.949 --> 01:14:43.918

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.923

- I don't wanna hear about that.

01:15:17.018 --> 01:15:20.287
We are together. I moved in.
I'm workin' at his bar.

01:15:20.321 --> 01:15:22.623

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:02.276
No. No, I just...

01:19:02.309 --> 01:19:04.278
like hangin' out with him
when I'm at the bar.

01:19:06.146 --> 01:19:08.115
I mean Danny.

01:19:08.148 --> 01:19:10.784
- Oh.
- You know he makes everyone

01:19:10.818 --> 01:19:13.287
feel like he's their
best friend, right? Tells you

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.390
all his secrets so you get
really close to him.

01:19:16.423 --> 01:19:20.160
But then one day, I realized
he doesn't give a fuck.

01:19:20.194 --> 01:19:22.329
He says that shit
to everyone he meets.

01:19:22.363 --> 01:19:25.132
We are close.

01:19:25.165 --> 01:19:28.335

01:19:32.239 --> 01:19:34.074
Anyway, he's gonna
have to sell the bar

01:19:34.108 --> 01:19:36.043
'cause his mother wouldn't
give him any money.

01:19:38.445 --> 01:19:40.914

01:19:46.186 --> 01:19:48.155

01:19:48.188 --> 01:19:49.890

01:19:52.059 --> 01:19:54.361
- No, it's way too small.

01:19:54.395 --> 01:19:56.163

01:20:11.646 --> 01:20:14.415

- Me and Danny.

01:20:20.287 --> 01:20:23.223
- You're pregnant?
- Yeah.

01:20:23.257 --> 01:20:26.126
And he wants to.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.895

01:20:27.928 --> 01:20:30.130
No, I haven't told him yet,

01:20:30.164 --> 01:20:33.233

01:20:33.267 --> 01:20:36.003

- Why?
- Will you be back later?

01:21:24.351 --> 01:21:26.954

01:21:56.083 --> 01:21:58.051

01:22:02.156 --> 01:22:04.291
- Can I come in?
- Mm.

01:22:10.665 --> 01:22:12.634

01:22:12.667 --> 01:22:15.436

01:22:25.179 --> 01:22:27.214

01:22:29.216 --> 01:22:31.118
Sit down if you like.

01:22:53.373 --> 01:22:55.677

with you tonight?

01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:57.679
No.

01:22:57.712 --> 01:22:59.647
I don't think so.

01:22:59.681 --> 01:23:02.983
How come you let her
sleep in your bed but I can't?

01:23:05.219 --> 01:23:07.755
You have your own room.

01:23:24.238 --> 01:23:26.406
I just wanna be
close to you all the time.

01:23:34.549 --> 01:23:37.351
- I'm in love with you.
- Ah. Here.

01:23:37.384 --> 01:23:39.152
Get off me.

01:23:39.186 --> 01:23:41.121
Give me some fuckin' room.

01:23:41.154 --> 01:23:43.156
Stop saying shit like that.

01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:45.359
- I am, though.
- You're not.

01:23:49.531 --> 01:23:52.199
- I love you.
- No, you don't.

01:23:52.232 --> 01:23:55.068
You don't know me.

01:23:55.102 --> 01:23:57.170
Yes, I do.

01:23:57.204 --> 01:23:59.306
And you know me.

01:23:59.339 --> 01:24:01.208
And you love me.

01:24:04.177 --> 01:24:06.179
I don't.

01:24:06.213 --> 01:24:08.215
I know you love me.

01:24:08.248 --> 01:24:11.451
You came to get me.

01:24:11.485 --> 01:24:13.721
No. Listen.

01:24:13.755 --> 01:24:16.423
You left on your own.

01:24:16.456 --> 01:24:18.225
Get off me!

01:24:18.258 --> 01:24:20.628
All right.

01:24:20.662 --> 01:24:24.097
You needed a place to stay.
I gave you a place to stay.

01:24:24.131 --> 01:24:26.266
That's how this whole thing
went down, all right?

01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:29.604
That's what it is.
There's no more to it than that.

01:24:32.774 --> 01:24:34.876
Get up. Come on. It's OK.

01:24:34.909 --> 01:24:37.077
It's not...

01:24:39.279 --> 01:24:41.181
Just come on. Come up.

01:24:41.214 --> 01:24:43.216
Here you go. It's OK.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:46.219
- All right, come on. Oh, no, no.
- Come on.

01:24:46.253 --> 01:24:48.488
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Please, please,

01:24:48.523 --> 01:24:51.358
please, please.

01:24:56.931 --> 01:25:00.467
I can't, uh, I can't
have this going on.

01:25:00.501 --> 01:25:02.436
I got enough goin' on.

01:25:02.469 --> 01:25:04.606
What am I supposed to do now?

01:25:04.639 --> 01:25:06.674
I don't...

01:25:12.245 --> 01:25:15.516
We're gonna have a baby.

01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:17.451
- Who's "we"?
- Me.

01:25:17.484 --> 01:25:19.687
You and me.

01:25:19.721 --> 01:25:21.455
I'm pregnant.

01:25:27.427 --> 01:25:29.597
I, uh... I don't

01:25:29.631 --> 01:25:31.532
wanna hear anything like that.

01:25:31.566 --> 01:25:33.635
Like what? Are you just trying

01:25:33.668 --> 01:25:35.503
to rope me into being
your boyfriend or something?

01:25:35.536 --> 01:25:37.204
- 'Cause it's not gonna work.
- No! NO!

01:25:37.237 --> 01:25:39.907
- I'm not roping you in.
- I don't know what you got

01:25:39.941 --> 01:25:43.544
goin' on in your head up there
but it's not gonna happen.

01:25:46.547 --> 01:25:49.884
Why don't you believe me?

01:25:52.754 --> 01:25:54.555
Calm down.

01:26:02.429 --> 01:26:04.532
If you leave,
I'm gonna kill myself.

01:26:08.670 --> 01:26:11.238
Yeah, I am.
I'm gonna kill myself

01:26:11.271 --> 01:26:13.808
just like my mom did.

01:26:13.841 --> 01:26:17.679
OK. That's your solution?

01:26:17.712 --> 01:26:19.547
That's your answer
to everything?

01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.683
Toss yourself into the harbour,

01:26:21.716 --> 01:26:22.884
is that how you're gonna do it?

01:26:28.656 --> 01:26:31.258
Tess, you need some help, girl.

01:26:32.994 --> 01:26:36.898
And it ain't me. Can't let you
come crawlin' into my bed.

01:27:02.056 --> 01:27:04.992
I know it seems
like a lot of people.

01:27:05.026 --> 01:27:07.895
But I swear, we're not
just here to hang out. OK?

01:27:07.929 --> 01:27:10.665
Tess, I'm Dr. Summers.

01:27:10.698 --> 01:27:11.999
I'll be doing your procedure.

01:27:12.033 --> 01:27:14.535
- How you doing? You OK?
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:14.569 --> 01:27:16.303
- OK.
- Now, Tess?

01:27:16.336 --> 01:27:18.606
Just take this for me.
This is nitrous oxide,

01:27:18.639 --> 01:27:20.508
laughing gas.

01:27:20.541 --> 01:27:22.043
Now, all right, nice and tight.

01:27:22.076 --> 01:27:24.045
OK. Deep breaths.

01:27:24.078 --> 01:27:26.047
It's gonna make you feel
like you're swimming.

01:27:29.784 --> 01:27:31.586
That's good,
Tess. Just give us

01:27:31.619 --> 01:27:33.487
a few of those deep,
deep breaths.

01:27:33.521 --> 01:27:36.657
Thank you.

01:27:36.691 --> 01:27:38.826
- Good girl.
- Now, relax

01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:40.862
for me. Knees apart. Thank you.

01:27:43.564 --> 01:27:45.499
- How are you feeling?
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:45.533 --> 01:27:47.502
- OK?
- Bit of pressure, Tess.

01:27:47.535 --> 01:27:49.771
There's gonna be
a bit of a pinch now. OK?

01:27:49.804 --> 01:27:51.606
There you go.

01:27:51.639 --> 01:27:54.041
All right.

01:27:54.075 --> 01:27:56.677
Yup. Thank you.
I slept like a friggin' pretzel

01:27:56.711 --> 01:27:58.913
last night.
I woke up this morning

01:27:58.946 --> 01:28:01.716
and my arm was all in knots.
I swear, I had to do yoga

01:28:01.749 --> 01:28:04.619
- just to get out of bed.
- Oh, that must be nice.

01:28:04.652 --> 01:28:07.555
I never slept at all. Jaden went
and wet the bed again.

01:28:07.588 --> 01:28:09.957
- Oh, God.
- Oh, yeah. And then crawled in

01:28:09.991 --> 01:28:13.661
- with me.
- Just be glad.

01:28:13.694 --> 01:28:15.830
I mean, mine won't even
give me a hug anymore.

01:28:15.863 --> 01:28:17.932

Well, there you go!
Not pregnant anymore.

01:30:08.075 --> 01:30:09.810
You can put
your legs down now.

01:30:11.746 --> 01:30:13.915
You take it easy.
Just over on this side here.

01:30:15.683 --> 01:30:18.619
