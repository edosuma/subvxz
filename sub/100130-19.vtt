00:23.689 --> 00:25.645
Piper?

00:28.129 --> 00:31.007
- Expecting company?
- You think? What are you doing here?

00:31.169 --> 00:33.558
I was supposed to have
the house to myself tonight.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.684
God, I thought that that
was tomorrow night.

00:36.849 --> 00:39.409
No, I put it on the kitchen calendar
way in advance.

00:39.569 --> 00:41.002
That's why Phoebe's at the library,

00:41.169 --> 00:42.966
and you're supposed to be
out on assignment.

00:43.169 --> 00:44.807
Yeah, well, I was all day.

00:44.969 --> 00:48.757
I was just downstairs in the basement
developing these shots that I took.

00:48.969 --> 00:50.925
Actually, I was hoping
to get your opinion on them.

00:51.089 --> 00:53.000
But I guess now wouldn't
be a good time, would it?

00:53.169 --> 00:54.682
No.

00:56.169 --> 00:58.729
- Although, Leo's not really here yet.
- All right, make it fast.

00:58.929 --> 01:00.681
Okay.

01:01.609 --> 01:05.602
All right, so the magazine asked me
to capture faces in the city.

01:05.769 --> 01:08.237
So I went to the Haight
and I took these shots,

01:08.449 --> 01:11.009
- but look at this man.
- Yeah, so?

01:11.169 --> 01:14.206
So he is in every single one
of my pictures.

01:14.409 --> 01:16.320
I mean, I didn't really focus on him.

01:16.489 --> 01:18.366
I didn't even notice him
until I got home.

01:18.529 --> 01:22.442
But, I mean, there he is
in all of them, just hanging out.

01:22.609 --> 01:26.124
- Well, maybe he's homeless.
- Handing out flyers? I don't think so.

01:26.329 --> 01:27.318
And look at his face.

01:27.489 --> 01:30.686
I mean, he looks so sad
and determined.

01:35.409 --> 01:36.637
Okay, bye-bye.

01:40.809 --> 01:45.166
All right, so I'm gonna go now,
and I'll be downstairs

01:45.369 --> 01:46.597
and work all night long.

01:46.769 --> 01:49.158
And I'll be really quiet.
You don't have to worry about me.

01:49.329 --> 01:51.763
- Okay.
- So no sex without safe sex.

01:51.969 --> 01:53.846
- Thanks.
- Okay.

01:54.729 --> 01:56.560
By the way,
on the kitchen counter,

01:56.769 --> 01:59.283
there's a birthday card for Dad
if you wanna sign it.

01:59.449 --> 02:01.599
I don't. Night, Leo.

02:01.809 --> 02:03.083
Good night.

02:04.449 --> 02:06.917
That's weird. I wonder why
she doesn't wanna sign...

02:07.089 --> 02:08.488
Hi.

02:14.089 --> 02:15.283
You wanna sit down?

02:15.809 --> 02:19.245
Why don't we go upstairs,
since she's downstairs?

02:19.449 --> 02:21.758
Okay. I know a faster way.

02:21.969 --> 02:23.960
- You do?
- Yeah.

02:44.969 --> 02:48.405
- I'm sorry.
- I won't tell if you won't.

02:50.649 --> 02:53.117
- Hey. Hi, I'm Phoebe.
- I'm Charlene.

02:53.289 --> 02:55.325
Actually, we've met,
we even carpooled.

02:55.529 --> 02:57.440
Metaphysics 301, remember?

02:57.609 --> 03:00.169
That's right. And your dad
is the professor of that class, right?

03:00.329 --> 03:02.718
Yeah, he's a dirty rat.
He gave me a C.

03:02.889 --> 03:06.040
We don't get along, in anything,
even metaphysics.

03:06.249 --> 03:07.841
But I'm hoping that will change.

03:08.009 --> 03:10.079
I'm gonna finish my thesis,
get published.

03:10.249 --> 03:12.604
He'll finally have to
take me seriously.

03:12.769 --> 03:15.488
Run quick, before I start
telling you about my mother.

03:15.689 --> 03:17.645
No, it's okay. I've been
studying here for so long,

03:17.809 --> 03:20.039
it's nice to have someone to talk to.

03:20.209 --> 03:21.528
So, what's your thesis about?

03:21.689 --> 03:23.566
It's about the existence
of demons in our world.

03:25.249 --> 03:27.240
- Demons?
- Yeah, I've been researching

03:27.409 --> 03:30.162
for five years to prove they're not
just myths, like my dad thinks.

03:30.369 --> 03:32.325
That they actually really exist.

03:32.529 --> 03:33.882
I've got proof right here.

03:35.489 --> 03:38.401
- That's very interesting.
- But you believe in them, don't you?

03:38.569 --> 03:41.208
I mean, you seemed to in class.
Certainly knew a lot about them.

03:42.249 --> 03:47.369
It's really late, and I really
gotta go. Okay.

03:49.169 --> 03:52.400
It was really nice
talking to you, Charlene.

03:52.569 --> 03:54.480
- Take care, okay?
- Okay, see you around.

03:54.649 --> 03:56.446
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

04:39.569 --> 04:41.639
I'm sorry. You scared me.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.077
Wait.

06:20.609 --> 06:22.167
Hey, Piper.

06:22.329 --> 06:24.923
Will you do me a favour
and feed the cat?

06:25.089 --> 06:28.240
I wanna get down
to the Haight, you know.

06:28.409 --> 06:30.400
I wanna see if that guy
is still on the bus bench.

06:30.609 --> 06:34.727
You know, I just could not
stop thinking about him all night.

06:34.889 --> 06:37.403
I mean, there's no guarantee
that he'll actually be there,

06:37.569 --> 06:39.366
but if he is, I wanna
get a better shot.

06:39.969 --> 06:41.243
Prue.

06:42.249 --> 06:45.446
- What...? What are you doing in here?
- Piper, can you hand me a towel?

06:45.649 --> 06:47.958
- Prue.
- Leo.

06:51.929 --> 06:53.248
Nice orbs.

06:53.689 --> 06:55.839
Okay, bye.

06:56.369 --> 06:58.678
Bye. Out.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.967
Let me help you,
let me help you. All right.

07:02.129 --> 07:04.245
Go on, sicko.

07:15.529 --> 07:17.042
Phoebe.

07:19.209 --> 07:21.564
It's 8:00. It's 8:00.
I'm late for my finals.

07:21.769 --> 07:23.646
Phoebe, relax.

07:23.809 --> 07:25.765
It's Thursday.
Your finals are tomorrow.

07:25.929 --> 07:27.760
- It's Thursday?
- Yes.

07:27.969 --> 07:30.119
Today is Thursday. You sure?

07:30.329 --> 07:32.206
Okay, that's really good news.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.325
Please tell me you didn't do
another all-nighter.

07:34.849 --> 07:36.248
- I can't.
- Phoebe.

07:36.449 --> 07:38.599
What? Piper, what am I
supposed to do?

07:38.769 --> 07:40.282
- Hi, Leo.
- Hey.

07:40.449 --> 07:42.599
If I don't ace this final,
I'm gonna flunk out of school

07:42.769 --> 07:44.839
because of all the
demon-hunting interruptions.

07:45.049 --> 07:47.609
Still, Phoebe, you have to take care
of yourself. Get some rest.

07:47.969 --> 07:51.678
After. Piper, I did not go back
to college to fail at it, okay?

07:53.409 --> 07:55.604
So, what do I have to do?
Okay, I'm gonna go change,

07:55.769 --> 07:57.521
and then I'm gonna go to the library.

07:57.689 --> 08:03.286
Now, if any demon or warlock attacks,
please, just fend them off till Saturday.

08:04.369 --> 08:05.438
I have a question for you.

08:06.089 --> 08:10.082
Is it possible for someone to find proof
that demons really do exist?

08:10.249 --> 08:12.080
I don't know, maybe.

08:12.249 --> 08:14.479
But even if anybody did,
nobody would ever know about it.

08:14.649 --> 08:16.799
- What do you mean?
- Evil doesn't want anybody to know.

08:16.969 --> 08:20.325
It has a system for covering
its tracks, protecting its identity.

08:20.489 --> 08:22.957
That's why demons disappear
when you guys vanquish them.

08:24.449 --> 08:26.519
Why do you ask?

08:26.689 --> 08:27.883
Just curious.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.961
- Okay, adÃ­os.
- Wait, Phoebe.

08:31.809 --> 08:33.527
Don't you wanna sign
Dad's birthday card?

08:33.929 --> 08:35.520
Why? He never sends me one.

08:37.328 --> 08:40.048
She's right.
He doesn't to any of us.

08:40.208 --> 08:41.528
So why do I keep trying?

08:41.688 --> 08:44.999
- I'm just a sucker for punishment?
- No.

08:45.169 --> 08:47.808
You keep trying
because you never give up hope.

08:47.969 --> 08:50.085
That's one of the things
I love about you.

08:50.249 --> 08:52.968
You never gave up on us.

08:53.129 --> 08:55.165
Were you close to your dad?

08:56.929 --> 09:00.001
Well, that was a long time ago.

09:00.169 --> 09:02.125
Different lifetime.

09:02.289 --> 09:04.849
I prefer to focus on the present.

09:05.009 --> 09:07.762
So do I, which means I have to go.
I have a dentist appointment.

09:07.929 --> 09:10.124
- How long can you stay?
- Till they call.

09:10.289 --> 09:12.962
If they don't call before lunch,
why don't you meet me at the club?

09:13.129 --> 09:14.323
- I'll buy.
- You'll have to.

09:14.529 --> 09:16.724
Whitelighter pay sucks.

09:30.209 --> 09:31.642
Hi.

09:31.809 --> 09:33.208
My name's Prue Halliwell.

09:33.369 --> 09:35.007
Cleavant Wilson.

09:35.369 --> 09:39.157
I'm a photographer
with 415 magazine.

09:39.369 --> 09:41.599
I'd like to know if it's okay
if I take your picture.

09:41.769 --> 09:43.282
- Why?
- We're doing a feature

09:43.489 --> 09:46.401
called "Faces in the City,"
and I would love to include yours.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.204
I'm not interested.

09:52.369 --> 09:56.157
Although, I would appreciate it
if you would include this one.

09:57.489 --> 09:58.888
"Tyra L. Wilson."

09:59.089 --> 10:00.522
My daughter.

10:00.689 --> 10:03.681
She was murdered six and a half
months ago here waiting for the bus.

10:05.249 --> 10:06.443
I'm looking for a witness.

10:09.689 --> 10:13.125
That's why you were sitting here
all day yesterday.

10:13.289 --> 10:14.722
That's why I'm here every day.

10:14.929 --> 10:17.887
I have been since
the police quit on us.

10:19.209 --> 10:21.598
I'm not leaving until I find somebody
who saw what happened.

10:22.969 --> 10:24.448
How can you be sure that you will?

10:25.009 --> 10:26.920
I will.

10:27.089 --> 10:29.284
I have to be sure.

10:30.969 --> 10:32.482
So are you gonna print that or not?

10:33.569 --> 10:36.720
Actually, it's not really up to me.

10:41.569 --> 10:43.161
I'm just looking for a witness.

10:43.329 --> 10:44.398
Just looking for a witness.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.885
Sir, I'm looking for a witness.

10:47.089 --> 10:49.125
You don't have to be afraid
to come forward.

10:56.929 --> 10:59.648
- What?
- You two must've been very close.

11:00.689 --> 11:03.044
She was my daughter.

11:03.209 --> 11:04.881
It doesn't get any closer.

11:08.409 --> 11:10.639
You know, I have a friend,

11:10.809 --> 11:13.926
a really good friend,
who's an inspector.

11:14.089 --> 11:17.081
You know, maybe I can call them,
see if they have any ideas who did it.

11:17.289 --> 11:19.280
I know who did it.

11:19.449 --> 11:22.566
The punk that owns that pawnshop
across the street, Gibbs.

11:26.289 --> 11:28.962
He killed my little girl.

11:29.129 --> 11:32.280
- Why?
- Wrong place, wrong time.

11:33.089 --> 11:34.886
Everybody knows he did it.

11:35.089 --> 11:37.523
Problem is, he's got everyone
too afraid to talk.

11:57.689 --> 11:59.839
Hey! Hey!

12:00.009 --> 12:02.318
Hey! Hey!

12:04.809 --> 12:06.879
All right, you first.

12:08.129 --> 12:09.608
What the hell is going on here?

12:09.769 --> 12:11.327
Don't ask me,
he came in here punching.

12:11.529 --> 12:13.406
Dan did?
Well, what did you do to him?

12:13.609 --> 12:16.442
- What did I do? Nothing.
- Come on. He had to have a reason.

12:16.769 --> 12:18.521
Like losing you isn't enough reason.

12:19.209 --> 12:21.439
All right, back
to your position. Go on.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.602
You kidding me?
He's about to clock me.

12:23.809 --> 12:26.039
I'm sorry, I can't help you
with that. Let's go.

12:27.009 --> 12:27.998
Let's go.

12:36.329 --> 12:38.206
Piper, where did you come from?

12:38.409 --> 12:40.798
I'll be asking the questions.
What the hell is going on?

12:41.009 --> 12:43.728
- I don't know, why don't you ask him?
- I did... I mean, I will.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.607
I'm asking you first.

12:46.249 --> 12:50.322
- You know what? I just gotta go.
- Dan, wait.

12:52.009 --> 12:54.159
Oh, no, you don't. They can wait.

12:54.369 --> 12:56.325
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Leo.

13:06.289 --> 13:09.964
Agent Cucushny, at this time, we need
you to return to homequarters.

13:16.689 --> 13:18.600
Excuse me.

13:18.769 --> 13:20.566
Excuse...

13:22.089 --> 13:24.284
Darryl.

13:31.929 --> 13:33.806
Don't tell me. Demons, right?

13:33.969 --> 13:35.687
Or is it warlocks this time?

13:36.289 --> 13:39.645
- What are you talking about, Darryl?
- You're not here because of this?

13:39.849 --> 13:42.044
No, Darryl, contrary
to popular belief,

13:42.209 --> 13:44.677
not every crime in the city
is demonically related.

13:44.849 --> 13:47.158
Or Halliwell-related, for that matter.

13:47.329 --> 13:48.603
I was on my way to the library.

13:48.809 --> 13:50.288
- What happened?
- College student.

13:50.489 --> 13:52.639
She was decapitated
and her body was dumped here.

13:53.129 --> 13:55.165
College student. Any idea who?

13:57.849 --> 13:59.726
Charlene Hughes.

13:59.889 --> 14:01.561
Charlene.

14:01.729 --> 14:03.447
You know her?

14:05.889 --> 14:07.800
I saw her last night in the library.

14:26.209 --> 14:28.279
Hey, Phoebe.

14:29.129 --> 14:32.439
Do you have an aspirin?
I have a splitting headache.

14:32.649 --> 14:34.128
Charlene.

14:36.169 --> 14:37.397
You're supposed to be...

14:38.329 --> 14:39.648
I'm supposed to be what?

14:54.569 --> 14:57.606
Okay, just tell Dan
that I called again, okay?

14:57.769 --> 15:00.841
No, believe me, he knows
what it's about. Thank you.

15:01.769 --> 15:04.044
- They're both ducking me.
- Who both?

15:04.249 --> 15:06.126
- What happened in here?
- Dan and Leo.

15:06.289 --> 15:08.928
I found them in here
beating the crap out of each other

15:09.089 --> 15:11.045
and neither one of them
will tell me why.

15:11.969 --> 15:14.324
Well, I hate to top that,

15:14.489 --> 15:17.083
but I am dealing with a ghost
who doesn't know she's a ghost.

15:17.289 --> 15:19.086
She thinks she's still alive.

15:19.289 --> 15:22.440
Charlene, she's a student
that I know, or knew.

15:22.609 --> 15:24.804
The police found her body
behind the library,

15:25.009 --> 15:27.079
about 20 feet away from her head.

15:27.289 --> 15:29.405
So I went back to the library,
and I saw her ghost.

15:29.609 --> 15:32.681
You know? And I tried to tell her,
but I just couldn't.

15:33.009 --> 15:35.477
You're right. Yours tops mine.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.920
I just don't get it. How could someone
not know that they're dead?

15:40.089 --> 15:44.002
Well, it takes them a while to accept it,
to get over the shock.

15:44.209 --> 15:48.168
Why today of all days?
I have got to study.

15:48.969 --> 15:51.119
Hey, I know. Maybe you could
help me out with this one,

15:51.289 --> 15:53.166
and then I could take
the next two ghosts, okay?

15:53.369 --> 15:55.200
Nice try, Pheebs,
but you know how this works.

15:55.409 --> 15:57.286
That ghost came to you
for a reason,

15:57.489 --> 16:00.561
and more than likely it's to get justice
for her murder so she can move on.

16:00.769 --> 16:03.681
The other thing, I think
a demon actually killed her.

16:03.849 --> 16:06.727
Oh, and you were gonna
pawn this off on me.

16:06.889 --> 16:10.086
Well, no, I was gonna tell you
about the demon part sooner or later.

16:10.489 --> 16:13.686
But remember what Leo said
about evil covering up its tracks?

16:13.849 --> 16:15.965
I think that's what happened
to Charlene.

16:16.129 --> 16:19.326
She was convinced that she found
proof that demons really do exist.

16:19.489 --> 16:21.957
Well, then you have to get her
to tell you what that proof was.

16:22.169 --> 16:24.444
But first you're gonna
have to tell her that she's dead.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.759
I know. That's the problem.

16:27.409 --> 16:29.604
How do you tell someone
that their life is over?

16:35.169 --> 16:36.443
Darryl.

16:36.609 --> 16:39.885
See, I knew I was right the first time.

16:40.049 --> 16:41.721
You guys don't give me
nearly enough credit.

16:41.889 --> 16:43.322
Credit?

16:43.489 --> 16:45.127
First Phoebe, now you.

16:45.289 --> 16:48.679
I've learned by now that if it walks
like a duck and it quacks like a duck...

16:48.849 --> 16:51.317
Okay, Darryl,
what are you talking about?

16:53.409 --> 16:56.242
Demons. You're here to tell me
one got Charlene, right?

16:56.409 --> 16:59.685
Okay, number one,
I have no idea who Charlene is.

16:59.849 --> 17:03.239
Number two, I'm here to talk about
Cleavant Wilson's daughter, Tyra.

17:03.849 --> 17:06.602
Tyra? She wasn't killed by demons.

17:07.049 --> 17:09.404
No, but you guys have an idea
of who killed her, right?

17:09.608 --> 17:11.520
Yeah, we got a pretty good idea.

17:11.689 --> 17:15.318
- Just a pretty good idea?
- All right, a very good idea.

17:15.489 --> 17:18.446
- Why are you so interested?
- Honestly, I'm not entirely sure.

17:18.608 --> 17:21.362
I just... I'm drawn to him
for some reason

17:21.529 --> 17:23.359
and usually that means to help.

17:23.569 --> 17:25.480
Unless you can magically
turn up a witness,

17:25.809 --> 17:27.321
I doubt there's anything you can do.

17:28.169 --> 17:31.798
- You can't, right, magically?
- No, if I could do that, Darryl,

17:31.969 --> 17:34.961
Cleavant wouldn't be out there
giving up his life trying to find one.

17:35.129 --> 17:37.324
You really wanna help?
Convince him to give up trying.

17:37.489 --> 17:40.925
Help him to move on. No one
is ever going to testify against Gibbs.

17:41.129 --> 17:44.201
- We have been down that road.
- He is never gonna give up, Darryl.

17:44.369 --> 17:46.121
His daughter was his entire life.

17:46.289 --> 17:48.644
And why are you guys
so okay with giving up?

17:48.809 --> 17:50.879
Look, Gibbs owns that street, okay?

17:51.089 --> 17:53.398
Tyra was probably gunned down
because she saw something

17:53.569 --> 17:54.604
he didn't want her to see.

17:54.809 --> 17:56.481
And short of us finding a witness

17:56.649 --> 17:59.686
or him walking up
on the street and confessing...

18:00.689 --> 18:02.839
...there's nothing I can do.

18:04.569 --> 18:07.083
Maybe there's something I can do.

18:25.609 --> 18:28.567
I got your messages.
All eight of them.

18:30.169 --> 18:32.125
So you wanna tell me
what the fight was about?

18:32.809 --> 18:36.358
Actually, I was hoping Leo would,
but I gather he hasn't.

18:36.529 --> 18:39.521
He's unreachable, apparently.

18:41.089 --> 18:43.045
You know, this is very
awkward for me.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.086
I don't wanna come across
as the jealous ex,

18:45.249 --> 18:47.604
but that's not what this is about.

18:47.769 --> 18:49.441
That's why I went to Leo first.

18:49.649 --> 18:52.038
But, see, I started it.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.802
I came at him very hard
with this, and...

18:55.969 --> 18:56.958
With what?

18:57.329 --> 18:59.718
Do you remember my brother-in-law
who works for the State Department?

18:59.889 --> 19:01.038
When I asked him about Leo?

19:01.529 --> 19:03.997
Well, he found something wasn't right
with Leo's Army records.

19:04.209 --> 19:05.528
- Dan...
- I know. I asked him

19:05.689 --> 19:07.361
not to go any deeper
about this, okay?

19:08.369 --> 19:09.688
But he did.

19:09.849 --> 19:13.398
And he sent me this anyway,
something very unusual.

19:19.089 --> 19:21.523
Leo isn't who he says he is.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.807
But what you do with this
is all up to you.

19:28.969 --> 19:30.766
You know, I'm...

19:32.249 --> 19:33.443
I'm still here for you.

19:35.289 --> 19:37.200
I'm still your friend.

19:47.009 --> 19:48.237
What? Leo's married?

19:48.409 --> 19:50.718
Yeah, there's even a picture of her

19:50.889 --> 19:54.723
in his Army file being presented
his Purple Heart after he died.

19:54.889 --> 19:57.278
She's pretty. Her name is Lillian.

19:57.449 --> 20:00.282
Prue, why didn't he tell me about her?
Why would he hide that from me?

20:00.489 --> 20:01.922
I don't know. You have to ask him.

20:02.089 --> 20:05.968
Well, I'd love to, but he's conveniently
out of the calling area at the moment.

20:06.569 --> 20:09.845
Leave it to me to fall in love with
an angel who happens to be married.

20:11.329 --> 20:13.843
Maybe he didn't tell me about her
because he's still in love with her.

20:14.329 --> 20:15.444
No, come on.

20:15.649 --> 20:18.561
How do you know
she's even still alive?

20:18.729 --> 20:21.562
Well, I sort of did
a little Internet search.

20:21.769 --> 20:23.885
I was thinking maybe I should
go have a chat with her.

20:24.049 --> 20:26.768
No, Piper, I don't really think that
that's a very good idea.

20:26.929 --> 20:30.922
But speaking of chats, I need to go
and talk to this pawnshop guy

20:31.089 --> 20:33.603
before he closes, okay?
So we'll talk later?

20:33.769 --> 20:35.760
Yeah. Okay.

20:57.409 --> 20:59.525
We're closed.

20:59.689 --> 21:01.884
- Well, it's only a quarter...
- I said, we're closed.

21:02.049 --> 21:04.005
Get the hell out of here.

21:04.169 --> 21:05.568
You know, you don't scare me.

21:06.129 --> 21:07.642
Well, then you're stupid, lady.

21:08.009 --> 21:10.682
And stupid people don't last long
in this neighbourhood.

21:10.889 --> 21:12.607
Ask around.

21:14.409 --> 21:17.765
Are you threatening me?

21:19.769 --> 21:21.600
What, are you a reporter?

21:21.769 --> 21:23.964
You work for the DA's office, what?

21:24.169 --> 21:27.605
You know, I seen you over there
talking to that dead kid's old man.

21:27.769 --> 21:29.725
- I know what you want.
- Is that right?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.242
Yeah, and you ain't getting it.

21:31.609 --> 21:34.282
Nobody's gonna mouth
on me. Nobody.

21:34.489 --> 21:36.207
You're just wasting your time.

21:37.609 --> 21:39.565
And you're trespassing.

21:44.369 --> 21:48.567
You know, it must be something
living off of other people's pain.

21:50.209 --> 21:52.006
I hope it doesn't
come back to haunt you.

22:04.089 --> 22:06.683
If you saw anything, I'd appreciate it.

22:06.889 --> 22:09.084
- Appreciate your help.
- All right.

22:33.009 --> 22:34.886
Phoebe.

22:38.129 --> 22:40.324
Sorry. I didn't mean to spook you.

22:40.689 --> 22:44.159
So to speak. Charlene,
how are you feeling?

22:44.569 --> 22:46.764
Do you feel any different?

22:48.449 --> 22:52.237
My headache. I guess. Yeah.

22:52.409 --> 22:56.118
I mean, I just feel
kind of weird in general.

22:57.329 --> 22:58.808
I think that's to be expected.

23:02.609 --> 23:04.600
I think she's mad at us.

23:04.809 --> 23:08.597
Why don't we go over here so
we can talk and not disturb anybody.

23:14.049 --> 23:16.609
Is something wrong, Phoebe?

23:17.609 --> 23:20.442
Yes, Charlene, actually,
there is something wrong.

23:20.609 --> 23:25.080
I think that the reason that you've
been feeling so weird lately

23:25.289 --> 23:28.247
is because you're...

23:29.169 --> 23:30.158
You're a ghost.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.360
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, I know that this sounds crazy,

23:33.529 --> 23:36.566
and it's probably really hard for you
to accept, but think about it, Charlene.

23:36.729 --> 23:38.321
When was the last time
you ate something?

23:38.529 --> 23:41.282
Or were hungry,
for that matter. Or slept.

23:41.449 --> 23:43.087
I mean, are you tired
right now, Charlene?

23:43.289 --> 23:45.166
- Are you even tired?
- What are you saying?

23:45.369 --> 23:47.758
I'm saying that I think
a demon killed you last night.

23:47.929 --> 23:49.760
That's what I am trying to say.

23:49.969 --> 23:52.324
And the only reason I can see you
is because I'm a witch,

23:52.489 --> 23:53.717
and I'm supposed to help you.

23:54.649 --> 23:57.209
I think you're the one
who needs help, not me.

23:57.809 --> 24:00.528
Look, you don't believe me?
Try picking something up.

24:00.809 --> 24:03.562
Now, you know as well
as I do that neophyte ghosts

24:03.729 --> 24:06.243
cannot channel their anger
into moving material objects.

24:07.609 --> 24:10.203
Try picking up a book.
See for yourself.

24:22.609 --> 24:24.201
This is ridiculous.

24:24.369 --> 24:26.963
I am not dead.
I've got a full life ahead of me,

24:27.169 --> 24:29.922
and I will finish my thesis,
and I will be published.

24:30.649 --> 24:34.005
Charlene. Charlene, wait.

25:08.729 --> 25:11.004
- Anybody here?
- In here.

25:11.849 --> 25:14.522
Hey. Good, I was looking for that.

25:14.689 --> 25:16.247
Wait, what are you doing
with the Book?

25:16.449 --> 25:18.405
I'm looking for the demon
that's gonna kill me.

25:18.609 --> 25:20.247
I just love getting
those premonitions.

25:20.409 --> 25:22.206
Okay, what premonition? When?

25:22.369 --> 25:26.248
About an hour ago, right after I was
trying to tell Charlene that she's dead.

25:27.129 --> 25:29.165
I'm lost.

25:29.849 --> 25:32.966
Oh, sorry. Wrong sister.

25:33.129 --> 25:36.121
Okay, Cliffs Notes version:
She is a student

25:36.329 --> 25:38.320
who found proof that demons
really do exist.

25:38.489 --> 25:41.401
And this demon right here, Libris,
chopped off her head

25:41.569 --> 25:44.322
and dumped her body behind
the library because of it.

25:44.529 --> 25:47.089
There are a whole bunch
of Libris demons out there.

25:47.249 --> 25:49.968
Wherever humans have the potential
to find unequivocal proof

25:50.129 --> 25:51.881
of the existence of demons.

25:52.049 --> 25:54.404
Yeah, talk about
your conspiracy theories.

25:54.609 --> 25:57.169
Well, you just have to stop doing
whatever it is you're doing.

25:57.569 --> 26:03.804
I can't. Charlene's spirit can't move on
unless I get justice for her murder.

26:03.969 --> 26:06.278
So, what, by getting
murdered yourself?

26:06.489 --> 26:08.286
Well, hopefully not.

26:08.449 --> 26:11.168
On the bright side, I won't have
to suffer through flunking college.

26:13.169 --> 26:15.478
- So how was your day?
- Not as bad as yours,

26:15.649 --> 26:18.721
but it's gonna get a hell of a lot better
as soon as I find the truth spell.

26:18.929 --> 26:19.998
What do you need that for?

26:20.169 --> 26:22.444
To catch a murderer who thinks
he can get away with it.

26:23.529 --> 26:25.759
So you're gonna use the truth spell
to make him confess?

26:26.089 --> 26:28.762
- Exactly.
- Not exactly. Prue, you can't do that.

26:28.969 --> 26:31.039
We can't use our powers
to punish the guilty.

26:31.209 --> 26:32.961
We learned that lesson
the hard way, remember?

26:33.169 --> 26:34.761
Yeah, but it's not
the same thing, Pheebs.

26:34.929 --> 26:37.238
I mean, I'm helping a father
with his grieving.

26:37.409 --> 26:38.478
I'm helping him to move on.

26:38.649 --> 26:40.844
It's more like protecting
the innocent.

26:41.449 --> 26:42.598
No, it's not, honey.

26:45.169 --> 26:47.683
Phoebe, I see this man
on the bus bench every single day,

26:47.849 --> 26:50.124
and he's just waiting there, hoping.

26:50.329 --> 26:53.799
Why was I drawn to him if I can't
help him nail his daughter's killer?

26:54.009 --> 26:58.321
- Why were you drawn to him?
- The look on his face, the pain.

26:58.489 --> 27:00.002
The pain of a father's loss?

27:00.929 --> 27:02.044
Maybe.

27:02.209 --> 27:05.246
I mean, I can't help
thinking about Dad,

27:05.409 --> 27:10.403
and wondering if it hurts him as much
not having his daughters in his life.

27:10.849 --> 27:12.965
- I think it does.
- Yeah, I wish I thought so too,

27:13.129 --> 27:16.121
but, you know, I keep on bumping up
against this whole theory

27:16.289 --> 27:18.041
that if it hurt him so much,
where is he?

27:26.089 --> 27:28.319
Phoebe.

27:28.529 --> 27:31.805
- Charlene. That's Charlene.
- You were right about me.

27:32.009 --> 27:35.524
I went home, saw the folks crying,
then I knew it was true.

27:35.729 --> 27:37.447
I've never seen my dad cry before.

27:37.609 --> 27:40.203
Not over me anyway.
Then I got pissed.

27:40.409 --> 27:43.003
If a demon did this to me,
I wanna get him.

27:43.489 --> 27:45.957
I wanna prove
he doesn't exist anymore.

27:47.769 --> 27:50.727
- Your friend, obviously?
- Yeah, the dead one.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.999
Leo's Purple Heart.

28:08.449 --> 28:09.928
He was a special man.

28:10.369 --> 28:11.848
He always went out of his way

28:12.009 --> 28:15.046
to try and help somebody,
even before he shipped out.

28:15.209 --> 28:17.279
He was studying to be
a doctor, you know.

28:17.449 --> 28:21.408
- Yes, I know.
- He'd have been a great one too.

28:22.009 --> 28:24.762
You know, he had
the most marvellous touch.

28:25.209 --> 28:29.964
It was gentle, sensitive...

28:30.689 --> 28:34.523
- Healing.
- Yes, exactly. A healing touch.

28:34.729 --> 28:38.165
That was Leo. And they said
that he was doctoring

28:38.329 --> 28:40.889
a wounded soldier
when it happened.

28:43.409 --> 28:46.526
I'll never forget when they came
to give me that news.

28:48.129 --> 28:49.608
It sounds like you still love him.

28:50.369 --> 28:54.408
I'll always love Leo, in a certain way,
for so many things,

28:54.889 --> 28:56.959
including helping me to move on.

28:58.089 --> 28:59.761
Move on. How'd he do that?

28:59.929 --> 29:04.480
Well, one night, not long after he died,
Leo came to me in a dream,

29:04.689 --> 29:10.047
and he was bathed in the most brilliant
white light that you could ever imagine.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.968
He said I was not to worry
about him,

29:13.169 --> 29:15.160
that he was in a good place.

29:16.889 --> 29:20.359
He also said that I was
to let him go,

29:20.529 --> 29:23.248
that there was another love
out there for me to find.

29:23.409 --> 29:25.001
- Another love?
- Yes.

29:25.209 --> 29:27.325
Another doctor, as it turned out.

29:27.489 --> 29:28.763
A wonderful man.

29:28.969 --> 29:35.442
He gave me two wonderful children,
grandchildren, even a great-grandchild.

29:37.289 --> 29:39.644
Leo was right.

29:43.609 --> 29:47.397
Well, I think I've taken up
enough of your time.

29:48.009 --> 29:50.648
But you haven't found
what you came for yet.

29:50.809 --> 29:52.367
Actually, I think I have.

29:52.529 --> 29:55.521
It was very nice to meet you, Lillian.

29:55.689 --> 29:56.963
You too, Piper.

30:03.409 --> 30:07.482
So I was walking down the aisle,
and I heard strange voices,

30:07.649 --> 30:11.278
whispers, sounded like Latin.

30:11.649 --> 30:15.608
And then I went
to pull out a book, and...

30:17.409 --> 30:18.524
I don't know.

30:18.969 --> 30:20.084
It all went dark,

30:20.249 --> 30:23.207
until I was back in the library again
with that terrible headache.

30:23.369 --> 30:25.803
You didn't get a chance
to see the demon?

30:25.969 --> 30:28.881
- Don't remember.
- All right, well, if it was Libris,

30:29.049 --> 30:32.803
he must've grabbed her in the aisle
and taken her somewhere to:

30:33.449 --> 30:35.963
- Sorry.
- That's okay. I'm over the shock.

30:36.409 --> 30:40.197
You know, the question is,
how did he grab her?

30:40.369 --> 30:42.246
And this vanquishing spell

30:42.409 --> 30:44.604
isn't gonna do us much good
if we can't catch him first.

30:44.809 --> 30:46.640
Well, we're gonna
have to do it in the library

30:46.809 --> 30:49.164
if we're gonna keep
that premonition from coming true.

30:49.329 --> 30:51.968
Maybe I can retrace
Charlene's steps

30:52.169 --> 30:53.966
and that'll bring him
out into the open.

30:54.169 --> 30:56.285
- Phoebe.
- And just before he grabs me,

30:56.489 --> 30:58.525
you and Piper can use
your powers to stop him,

30:58.689 --> 31:00.486
and then we can
vanquish him, easy as that.

31:00.689 --> 31:02.680
- No, that is way too risky.
- How is it risky

31:02.889 --> 31:05.244
with two witches and a ghost
to back me up?

31:06.609 --> 31:07.962
Prue, help me get my demon,

31:08.489 --> 31:11.845
and I promise I'll do everything
I can to help you get yours.

31:15.609 --> 31:18.043
- I'm home.
- Come on.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.200
- Where are we going?
- We'll explain on the way.

31:20.369 --> 31:22.041
- Who's that?
- Let's go. Let's go.

31:22.209 --> 31:24.325
That's my dead friend.

31:27.089 --> 31:29.125
Last thing I wrote
was under "Demonic Acts."

31:29.689 --> 31:32.362
- There.
- You know, this is pretty accurate.

31:32.569 --> 31:33.922
You were really
onto something here.

31:34.489 --> 31:36.161
Obviously.

31:36.329 --> 31:37.808
Sorry.

31:37.969 --> 31:40.961
- Okay, what was next?
- I went to find the encyclopaedia.

31:41.169 --> 31:42.887
This way.

32:05.209 --> 32:06.437
There's the book.

32:09.129 --> 32:11.165
I don't hear any voices.

32:14.089 --> 32:16.000
Okay, here it goes.

32:22.449 --> 32:24.440
Maybe demons can see ghosts.

32:31.729 --> 32:33.208
Phoebe!

32:34.369 --> 32:35.802
Where is she? Where did she go?

32:46.609 --> 32:48.804
No!

32:56.609 --> 32:59.646
- What, the basement?
- Worth a try.

33:08.049 --> 33:09.801
Demon, hide your evil face

33:11.289 --> 33:12.847
Libris die, and leave no trace

33:19.249 --> 33:21.126
Thank God.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.799
Okay. All right.

33:26.969 --> 33:29.039
- That was close.
- Yeah.

33:29.209 --> 33:30.608
Thank God you're a quick study.

33:30.809 --> 33:33.118
At least justice was served.

33:33.289 --> 33:34.847
So I guess that means
I'm moving on.

33:35.009 --> 33:36.124
Bye, Phoebe.

33:36.329 --> 33:38.923
Thank you for this.
Thank you for helping me.

33:39.129 --> 33:41.040
You're welcome. Take care.

33:51.609 --> 33:53.167
Why am I not moving on?

33:53.609 --> 33:54.883
I have no idea.

34:03.409 --> 34:06.287
I thought you said all we have to do
is get justice for Charlene's murder?

34:06.449 --> 34:09.043
- I said, maybe that is all you had to do.
- You did not say maybe.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.809
- Yes, I did. I absolutely did.
- I did not hear the word maybe.

34:11.969 --> 34:13.721
Yes, I did.

34:13.889 --> 34:16.197
You guys aren't helping.

34:16.369 --> 34:18.599
Are you sure that
vanquishing spell really worked?

34:18.809 --> 34:22.245
- Maybe Libris isn't really gone.
- You know, you're getting good at that.

34:23.609 --> 34:25.201
I'm just frustrated, that's all.

34:25.609 --> 34:27.360
I told you she was a quick study.

34:27.529 --> 34:29.599
Maybe Charlene's right,
maybe you didn't vanquish him,

34:29.768 --> 34:32.408
- like the Demon of Illusion.
- No, he is definitely gone.

34:32.609 --> 34:34.964
I mean, the spell was
specifically written for Libris.

34:35.168 --> 34:38.286
Yeah, and he wouldn't have left
his sickle behind if he were still alive.

34:38.449 --> 34:40.360
But the question still remains:

34:40.529 --> 34:43.089
If justice was served, then what
is she still doing here?

34:44.089 --> 34:45.761
Damn it!

34:45.969 --> 34:48.358
Sorry.

34:50.409 --> 34:52.001
Wait a minute.

34:52.168 --> 34:54.239
- That's it.
- What? What is it?

34:54.569 --> 34:57.959
Maybe she has to get justice
for somebody else.

35:38.369 --> 35:40.280
Who's there?

35:57.049 --> 35:59.324
Gibbs.

36:09.049 --> 36:11.165
You really think you're tough
with that gun, don't you?

36:15.049 --> 36:16.277
"Tyra."

36:23.889 --> 36:26.323
- What the hell's going on?
- You wanna know what's going on?

36:26.489 --> 36:29.049
- Who are you?
- Who do you think I am?

36:29.209 --> 36:31.245
So how does it feel
to be pushed around?

36:38.169 --> 36:39.807
Murderer.

36:41.729 --> 36:44.004
I'm the woman you murdered.

36:45.049 --> 36:47.085
Leave me alone!

36:51.769 --> 36:53.122
Admit it.

36:53.329 --> 36:55.399
Admit you killed me,
or I will haunt every minute

36:55.569 --> 36:57.400
of every day of the rest
of your miserable life.

36:57.569 --> 36:59.958
Okay, okay!
Okay, I did it. I killed you.

37:00.129 --> 37:03.599
- Say it. Say my name, damn it!
- Tyra Wilson! Tyra Wilson!

37:03.769 --> 37:06.522
I killed Tyra Wilson, I admit it!

37:06.689 --> 37:10.443
I've been waiting a long time
to hear you say that, Gibbs.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.526
- Did you get that?
- I got every word.

37:15.449 --> 37:17.599
- What the hell is this?
- Justice.

37:17.769 --> 37:20.329
What's the matter, Gibbs,
you look like you've seen a ghost?

37:21.609 --> 37:23.122
I hope you rot in hell.

37:27.889 --> 37:29.368
How's this connected
to Charlene again?

37:29.569 --> 37:32.037
It's a cosmic thing, Darryl.
Don't worry about it.

37:40.409 --> 37:42.445
Are you okay, Mr. Wilson?

37:45.169 --> 37:46.921
Yeah, I guess.

37:47.089 --> 37:50.764
It's an empty feeling, though.
You know, it...

37:51.209 --> 37:54.246
This doesn't bring her back,
it doesn't take away the hurt.

37:54.409 --> 37:56.365
No, but at least you can
move on with your life.

37:56.529 --> 37:58.247
Tyra would've wanted that.

37:58.409 --> 38:01.048
I wish I could tell her how much
I love her just one more time.

38:05.089 --> 38:07.045
I think she'll get the message.

38:10.049 --> 38:11.607
Thank you...

38:13.369 --> 38:16.042
...for however
you made this happen.

38:26.529 --> 38:28.406
Thank you.

38:36.449 --> 38:40.328
Well, even if I could never seem
to please my own father,

38:40.529 --> 38:42.759
at least I could please
someone else's.

38:42.969 --> 38:44.197
I know what you mean.

38:48.569 --> 38:50.560
I think it's time.

39:25.049 --> 39:27.279
Hey. Ask me how I did on my final.

39:27.489 --> 39:30.925
- How did you do on your final?
- Oh, thank you for asking.

39:31.089 --> 39:32.886
I aced it. They just
posted the grades.

39:33.089 --> 39:34.568
- Good for you.
- Thanks.

39:34.729 --> 39:37.243
Although, I did get
some perspective on the test.

39:37.409 --> 39:41.527
After what happened to Charlene,
it just didn't seem important anymore.

39:43.209 --> 39:47.248
Speaking of perspective,
I signed Dad's card.

39:47.449 --> 39:49.041
- Really?
- Yes.

39:49.249 --> 39:51.080
Just in case he thinks of us too.

39:52.569 --> 39:54.446
No, I definitely
don't need to sign that.

39:54.649 --> 39:57.766
I mean, I realize that Dad is never
gonna be the father that Cleavant is,

39:57.929 --> 40:00.841
and I just need to accept that

40:01.009 --> 40:04.319
and stop thinking that magically
he's somehow gonna change.

40:10.689 --> 40:12.441
Excuse me.

40:16.809 --> 40:19.198
How'd you get in?
I thought whitelighter pay sucked.

40:19.409 --> 40:23.766
I sort of didn't tell the bouncer
I don't work here anymore.

40:23.969 --> 40:27.120
Imagine that. Like you sort of
didn't tell me you were married?

40:29.489 --> 40:33.846
Look, Piper, I didn't tell you,
because I didn't want you to get upset.

40:34.009 --> 40:36.045
And it was literally
a different lifetime for me,

40:36.209 --> 40:40.043
one that has nothing to do
with this one, with us.

40:40.209 --> 40:43.201
I know that, and I'm not mad,

40:43.369 --> 40:46.600
but you can't not tell me stuff
because you think it might hurt.

40:46.809 --> 40:48.561
If we're gonna have
a normal relationship,

40:48.769 --> 40:51.920
at least as normal as possible,
then you need to be honest with me.

40:53.769 --> 40:56.203
You're right. I'm sorry.

40:56.409 --> 40:59.048
- Forgive me?
- I'll think about it.

41:05.409 --> 41:08.128
So how much do you think
Dan really knows?

41:08.569 --> 41:11.242
I don't know.
We'll worry about it later.
