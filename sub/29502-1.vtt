01:40.590 --> 01:42.069
Congratulations.

01:42.070 --> 01:42.903
Thank you.

01:42.904 --> 01:44.649
We were very nervous, believe me.

01:44.650 --> 01:45.483
Truly?

01:45.483 --> 01:46.316
No one noticed.

01:46.317 --> 01:47.799
You seem really happy Joan.

01:47.800 --> 01:48.800
Of course he is.

01:50.060 --> 01:52.429
And what about Miguel, the pastry cook?

01:52.430 --> 01:55.119
He makes the best
ensaimadas in Mallorca.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.309
In the world.

01:56.310 --> 01:57.899
They are delicious.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.829
Now he's making them with sobrasada,

01:59.830 --> 02:01.513
figs, and pumpkin jam.

02:02.450 --> 02:03.539
Angel hair.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.609
Yum yum.

02:04.610 --> 02:07.099
He's a very such a nice man.

02:07.100 --> 02:08.100
Do you excuse me?

02:18.780 --> 02:20.609
It's time for you to come to Mallorca.

02:20.610 --> 02:22.409
Will you promise you will?

02:22.410 --> 02:23.360
You have my word.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.360
Okay.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.339
Your spirit stays young
if you stay curious.

02:28.340 --> 02:29.717
Yes.

02:29.718 --> 02:32.199
What about going to a restaurant?

02:32.200 --> 02:34.299
You feel like something to eat?

02:34.300 --> 02:35.240
Not really.

02:35.241 --> 02:36.649
Should we just go back to Brixton?

02:36.650 --> 02:38.199
You'd prefer a quiet drink at home?

02:38.200 --> 02:39.033
- Yeah.
- Yes.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.459
Oh I can't, that's a pity.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.769
I have friends waiting
for me at High Gate.

02:42.770 --> 02:44.519
You know, Joan's a real ace.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.533
Yes.

02:45.534 --> 02:46.510
Sometimes you have to be half crazy

02:46.511 --> 02:48.398
to chart a new path like he has.

02:49.233 --> 02:50.799
Indeed.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.489
Have a nice night.

02:52.490 --> 02:54.009
People don't notice whether it's

02:54.010 --> 02:55.860
winter or summer when they are happy.

02:56.770 --> 02:58.263
Tomorrow I am back to Paris.

02:59.150 --> 03:00.199
You give me a call.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.033
Yes.

03:01.033 --> 03:02.033
For sure.

03:03.470 --> 03:04.470
Enjoy.

03:05.330 --> 03:06.330
It's free.

03:14.260 --> 03:17.993
Brixton Station.

03:28.107 --> 03:30.319
The world is divided into two classes.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.909
Those who believe they're incredible,

03:31.910 --> 03:34.009
and those who do the improbable.

03:34.010 --> 03:35.969
An idea that is not dangerous

03:35.970 --> 03:38.739
is unworthy of being
called an idea at all.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.289
Daniel didn't come?

03:40.290 --> 03:42.139
He's so busy in Barcelona

03:42.140 --> 03:44.779
we haven't seen much
of each other recently.

03:44.780 --> 03:46.169
Why?

03:46.170 --> 03:47.229
Aren't you two friends anymore?

03:47.230 --> 03:48.839
And I've got lots of work too.

03:48.840 --> 03:49.840
In Girona.

03:51.980 --> 03:55.139
All we need to learn is how
to appreciate our differences.

03:55.140 --> 03:57.739
Oh the paths of life.

03:57.740 --> 03:59.762
Man is evil by nature.

03:59.763 --> 04:02.329
Goodness is an acquired habit.

04:02.330 --> 04:04.899
Life's really simple isn't it?

04:04.900 --> 04:08.179
But why do we insist on
making it so complicated?

04:08.180 --> 04:11.329
Any man trying to travel
two paths at the same time

04:11.330 --> 04:13.759
will get nowhere fast.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.489
Where's Mika?

04:15.490 --> 04:17.649
Visiting his Suami family in Vaasa.

04:17.649 --> 04:19.009
That's in Finland?

04:19.010 --> 04:20.010
That's right.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.659
Let me play you a nice song.

04:22.660 --> 04:24.779
It's from your neck of the woods.

04:24.780 --> 04:28.620
Everything has beauty, but
not everyone can see it.

07:14.830 --> 07:16.759
It's always possible
to find the guilty one

07:16.760 --> 07:19.119
to avoid feeling guilty oneself.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.359
I guess so.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.959
Dreams often seem most profound

07:22.960 --> 07:25.533
when they're the most crazy.

07:27.340 --> 07:29.889
Maria's coming tomorrow for brunch.

07:29.890 --> 07:30.840
Maria?

07:30.841 --> 07:32.129
She's a friend.

07:32.130 --> 07:32.963
Colleague.

07:32.963 --> 07:33.820
The shrink?

07:33.821 --> 07:36.179
The most famous Freudian
psychiatrist there is.

07:36.180 --> 07:37.669
You must know her.

07:37.670 --> 07:39.299
Maria, of course.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.339
She's coming mainly because of you.

07:41.340 --> 07:43.009
She's a friend of my mothers.

07:43.010 --> 07:44.549
She's a very clever woman.

07:44.550 --> 07:46.557
And a great humane person.

07:59.550 --> 08:01.909
Can't you leave off that David?

08:01.910 --> 08:03.669
Sorry, it's a habit.

08:03.670 --> 08:05.409
Obsession more like.

08:05.410 --> 08:06.400
But great fun.

08:06.401 --> 08:08.172
Addiction you mean?

08:08.173 --> 08:09.729
Not at all.

08:09.730 --> 08:12.369
All right, let's go downstairs.

08:12.370 --> 08:14.059
A man who doesn't think for himself

08:14.060 --> 08:15.467
doesn't think at all.

11:03.548 --> 11:04.692
Surprise!

11:04.693 --> 11:06.569
Oh, oh, how lovely.

11:06.570 --> 11:07.683
Come on in.

11:15.410 --> 11:16.410
Oh.

11:17.230 --> 11:18.880
I need to take this, do you mind?

11:21.180 --> 11:22.349
Hello?

11:22.350 --> 11:23.183
Peter?

11:23.184 --> 11:24.629
Maria.

11:24.630 --> 11:26.209
Is David around?

11:26.210 --> 11:27.210
Yeah, hold on.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.629
Hi Maria, how are you?

11:30.630 --> 11:33.929
So, it was the spur of the moment trip?

11:33.930 --> 11:35.069
I fancy coming to London

11:35.070 --> 11:37.119
so I thought I'd just take a few days off.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.099
Oh I'm sorry I missed the concert.

11:39.100 --> 11:40.393
I couldn't cancel.

11:43.010 --> 11:44.649
I'm sure they'll be back.

11:44.650 --> 11:46.539
You just got to be patient my dear.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.199
And undemanding.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.809
Look, I'll come over.

11:50.810 --> 11:51.770
It won't take me long.

11:51.770 --> 11:52.630
I'll get a cab.

11:52.631 --> 11:54.359
You're such a marvelous friend.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.329
And a faithful one.

11:56.330 --> 11:57.703
That's you to a T.

12:00.530 --> 12:01.919
I am so sorry.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.829
I have to go see my best friends son.

12:04.830 --> 12:06.359
He's leaving today.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.193
Of course.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.859
Oh you're such a dear.

15:07.460 --> 15:08.649
How's Betsy?

15:08.650 --> 15:10.709
Mother is in Cadaques as ever.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.102
I envy her paradise.

15:13.103 --> 15:14.479
So do I.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.699
I'll call her soon.

15:15.700 --> 15:16.580
Hm?

15:16.581 --> 15:18.859
So David, you're on your way home?

15:18.860 --> 15:21.089
I'll call the taxi to take
you to Clapham Junction.

15:21.090 --> 15:22.669
I better go upstairs and pack.

15:22.670 --> 15:23.670
It won't take long.

15:28.740 --> 15:29.740
How's Mika?

15:30.790 --> 15:31.959
Back in Finland.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.529
Far too cold.

15:33.530 --> 15:35.219
Only for a couple of weeks.

15:35.220 --> 15:37.369
I prefer the Mediterranean.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.370
Peter.

15:39.340 --> 15:41.869
Sometimes the most
important things in life

15:41.870 --> 15:46.483
are those that don't seem
to be important at all.

15:50.220 --> 15:51.789
Hurry up!

15:51.790 --> 15:52.790
I'm ready.

15:59.509 --> 16:00.342
Goodbye.

16:00.342 --> 16:01.175
Goodbye.

16:01.175 --> 16:02.008
Bye.

16:02.008 --> 16:02.841
Take care young man.

16:02.842 --> 16:04.059
Give my love to your mother.

16:04.060 --> 16:05.986
I will, as soon as I can.

16:05.987 --> 16:09.059
Work and love, love and
work, that's all there is.

16:09.060 --> 16:12.283
Wherever you go, go
with all of your heart.

16:35.978 --> 16:37.259
Oh I'm sorry.

16:37.260 --> 16:39.723
Hope I didn't hurt you.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.569
Hi Maria.

21:54.570 --> 21:55.540
I'm well thank you.

21:55.541 --> 21:56.639
I'm back in Girona.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.259
Back working.

21:58.260 --> 22:01.409
I really enjoyed meeting
up and I'll tell mother.

22:01.410 --> 22:02.419
Hope to see you soon

22:02.420 --> 22:04.163
and give my love to Peter.

22:08.170 --> 22:10.699
If life is to mean anything,

22:10.700 --> 22:13.199
learn to live slowly.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.566
One can't open a book
without learning something.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.379
No matter what they say,

22:18.380 --> 22:21.403
words and ideas change the world.

22:28.610 --> 22:30.179
Life is short.

22:30.180 --> 22:31.980
And it's up to you to make it sweet.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.969
Oh Maria, did she go
to the show in London?

22:36.970 --> 22:38.179
No, she couldn't.

22:38.180 --> 22:39.013
Just Peter and David.

22:39.014 --> 22:40.737
Oh well, and Coco too.

22:41.670 --> 22:42.769
Coco?

22:42.770 --> 22:44.993
Ah, you mean Coco L'Amour.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.429
I have never met Maria.

22:48.430 --> 22:50.469
Oh, she's very close to Peter.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.723
Peter's lovely.

22:52.910 --> 22:54.949
I just talked to him a few weeks ago.

22:54.950 --> 22:57.939
Him and Mika are the perfect couple.

22:57.940 --> 23:02.129
- With David and...
- We couldn't talk much.

23:02.130 --> 23:05.119
Betsy told me her sons
relationship with Daniel

23:05.120 --> 23:06.849
isn't going well at all.

23:06.850 --> 23:08.069
So it was him.

23:08.070 --> 23:09.389
Sometimes.

23:09.390 --> 23:12.429
Sometimes when we make
it hard for ourselves.

23:12.430 --> 23:15.149
I generally avoid temptation.

23:15.150 --> 23:16.849
Unless I can't resist it.

23:16.850 --> 23:19.049
And men who doesn't think for himself

23:19.050 --> 23:20.389
doesn't think at all.

23:20.390 --> 23:22.145
Tell me about your success in London.

23:22.146 --> 23:24.399
I want to hear it firsthand from you.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.359
Comedy is all about
giving form to optimism.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.413
You are right.

23:29.740 --> 23:32.339
I predicted MGMC would get an

23:32.340 --> 23:34.859
amazing accept in the Cadogan Hall.

23:34.860 --> 23:38.429
Although I'm a German-Scotty,
I knew the Londoners

23:38.430 --> 23:41.076
would absolutely adore
you and I was right.

23:41.077 --> 23:42.529
You know, Courage has one,

23:42.530 --> 23:45.295
that funny Chinese guy got in touch.

23:47.820 --> 23:49.883
The Chinese are very clever.

23:51.790 --> 23:53.209
Virtue has it's own reward,

23:53.210 --> 23:55.489
but has no sell at the box office.

23:55.490 --> 23:56.609
That's a fact.

23:56.610 --> 23:58.239
The whole world is a stage

23:58.240 --> 24:01.593
and all the men and
women are merely actors.

24:02.450 --> 24:06.159
Without vanity there would be no artists.

24:06.160 --> 24:09.259
Ego is indispensable.

24:09.260 --> 24:10.683
I have to WhatsApp Betsy.

24:12.290 --> 24:14.769
Tell me all about the show in Calvia.

24:14.770 --> 24:17.219
It's going to be a big hit.

24:17.220 --> 24:18.370
Is it going to be soon?

27:17.650 --> 27:18.799
No reply.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.179
Betsy must be really worried.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.789
David is her only son.

27:21.790 --> 27:23.053
Ah, she has one else.

27:24.180 --> 27:25.587
That's not surprising.

27:26.571 --> 27:30.619
Oh to err is human,
but it feels divine.

27:30.620 --> 27:33.169
It's better to love than to cry.

27:33.170 --> 27:35.649
Ah, the mere sense of
living is joy enough.

27:35.650 --> 27:37.669
And however difficult life may seem,

27:37.670 --> 27:39.929
there's always something you can do

27:39.930 --> 27:41.113
and succeed at.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.629
I'm really hungry.

29:14.630 --> 29:15.921
Let's carry on.

29:37.089 --> 29:38.089
There we go again.

29:39.372 --> 29:40.372
Oh my.

29:53.340 --> 29:55.090
That's the way I like it.

30:25.930 --> 30:26.930
So.

30:28.740 --> 30:29.759
How was London?

30:29.760 --> 30:30.769
It was great.

30:30.770 --> 30:31.730
You should have come.

30:31.731 --> 30:34.426
Oh, too much going on
actually, it was difficult.

30:34.427 --> 30:36.499
Oh because you're so conscientious.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.699
Nonsense.

30:37.700 --> 30:38.849
You can't complain.

30:38.850 --> 30:40.259
Yeah, do the job you love

30:40.260 --> 30:41.749
and you will never have to work

30:41.750 --> 30:43.941
another day in your entire life.

30:43.942 --> 30:46.259
You should bring a
friend from India to help.

30:46.260 --> 30:48.229
I don't plan to expand that much.

30:48.230 --> 30:49.489
I think our team is enough.

30:49.490 --> 30:51.212
Oh you think so?

30:51.213 --> 30:52.629
Though I prefer the last,

30:52.630 --> 30:54.979
you could find me a nice looking one.

30:54.980 --> 30:56.839
I'm afraid I haven't got much help

30:56.840 --> 30:58.170
to offer in that quarter.

30:59.170 --> 31:00.299
I know, I know.

31:00.300 --> 31:01.749
I'm not in hurry.

31:01.750 --> 31:04.299
I'm just looking for
someone nice and audacious.

31:04.300 --> 31:05.800
Just like you.

31:05.801 --> 31:06.634
Avni.

31:06.635 --> 31:08.859
It doesn't matter how
snail paced you are,

31:08.860 --> 31:10.323
as long as you never stop.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.200
Come.

31:16.010 --> 31:18.629
You are sure to find a good man.

31:18.630 --> 31:19.463
You deserve it.

31:19.464 --> 31:22.149
Of course, I will.

31:22.150 --> 31:24.579
Always look your best.

31:24.580 --> 31:25.730
Who said love is blind?

31:27.050 --> 31:29.279
I only have yes men around me.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.033
Whoever needed a no man?

33:40.500 --> 33:42.939
You're such a darling.

33:42.940 --> 33:44.929
Look, anything worth doing,

33:44.930 --> 33:46.849
is worth doing slowly.

33:46.850 --> 33:50.033
You are only given the
tiniest spark of madness.

33:51.010 --> 33:52.143
Don't let it go.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.979
You must try to be good.

33:54.980 --> 33:56.416
Back to see Albert?

33:56.417 --> 33:57.250
Yeah.

33:57.251 --> 33:58.459
Well he needs some help.

33:58.460 --> 33:59.631
He phoned this morning.

33:59.632 --> 34:01.049
Well that's the first
I've heard about it.

34:01.050 --> 34:03.869
Yeah, he got some problem
with his computer and internet.

34:03.870 --> 34:05.409
Yet again.

34:05.410 --> 34:07.139
He lives by himself.

34:07.140 --> 34:09.998
I mean, he is a really respected novelist.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.359
I've read two of his books.

34:11.360 --> 34:12.809
They're very good actually.

34:12.810 --> 34:13.810
So here you go.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.219
Well give me a third kiss, French style.

34:20.292 --> 34:21.125
See ya.

34:21.125 --> 34:22.125
See you.

34:38.230 --> 34:39.599
That damn internet connection.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.829
Telephone company's are so
useless in this country.

34:41.830 --> 34:42.663
I understand.

34:42.663 --> 34:43.540
Look, don't worry.

34:43.541 --> 34:44.559
Spain is different.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.389
Visit Spain.

34:46.389 --> 34:47.509
Catalonia sir.

34:47.510 --> 34:48.342
Oh, of course.

34:48.342 --> 34:49.176
Excuse me.

34:49.177 --> 34:50.279
I can still remember
that Francoist ambassador

34:50.280 --> 34:52.498
in London who wore that funny bowler hat.

34:52.500 --> 34:53.998
Well that was his refrain for years.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.553
Ah, Franco Bahamonde.

34:55.554 --> 34:57.349
The man who invented the slogan.

34:57.350 --> 34:58.230
Really?

34:58.231 --> 34:59.879
Well he was an idiot.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.373
Stupidity is a big sin
on this earth David.

35:03.630 --> 35:04.980
Let me see what I can do.

35:07.340 --> 35:08.889
Hello Albert.

35:08.890 --> 35:10.369
How ya doing?

35:10.370 --> 35:11.633
Oh, not bad.

35:12.540 --> 35:15.279
It's been a long time since Martin died.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.129
And now you're in the middle
of a long period of mourning.

35:18.130 --> 35:19.729
Well, I wouldn't...

35:19.730 --> 35:22.229
Don't take it too much to heart.

35:22.230 --> 35:23.849
You know what they say.

35:23.850 --> 35:25.759
Time heals all wounds.

35:25.760 --> 35:27.039
Probably.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.040
For sure.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.823
We'll try to visit you.

35:33.230 --> 35:37.209
Memory is the diary we all carry with us.

35:37.210 --> 35:38.709
You know where I am.

35:38.710 --> 35:39.690
Thanks for calling.

35:39.691 --> 35:41.969
The easiest way to grow old quickly...

35:41.970 --> 35:43.579
One often grows old early

35:43.580 --> 35:45.289
when one is tired of living.

35:45.290 --> 35:48.403
Is to start believing
there's nothing important left.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.653
And to lose ones sense of irony Peter.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.549
You're off to Cadaques.

40:31.550 --> 40:33.179
I've never been.

40:33.180 --> 40:34.999
Albert says it's a real jewel.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.449
And Betsy's a wonderful host.

40:37.450 --> 40:40.639
In fact, Mika and I usually
stay in Vigo with Albert.

40:40.640 --> 40:43.459
Well, he needs the company.

40:43.460 --> 40:45.573
Particularly since he lost Martin.

40:46.540 --> 40:47.669
Friends must come first.

40:47.670 --> 40:49.219
You have to give them
the support they need.

40:49.220 --> 40:50.629
Oh yes of course.

40:50.630 --> 40:52.689
We're never so defenseless
against suffering

40:52.690 --> 40:53.890
than when we're in love.

44:18.010 --> 44:20.879
Life is the only truth.

44:20.880 --> 44:23.413
Death is the goal of all life.

44:24.940 --> 44:28.709
The world is divided
into two huge groups.

44:28.710 --> 44:31.639
The sensible people...
Who think like us.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.790
And the half-baked
who think differently.

44:34.730 --> 44:37.469
Life is never fair.

44:37.470 --> 44:39.639
Which is just as well for most of us.

44:39.640 --> 44:43.463
Truth is rarely pure and never simple.

44:44.850 --> 44:48.609
Laughter is never a bad
way to start a friendship

44:48.610 --> 44:51.917
and is by far the best way to finish one.

44:54.910 --> 44:58.409
It is absurd to divide
people into good and bad.

44:58.410 --> 45:01.153
People are either charming or tedious.

45:02.210 --> 45:05.309
The difference between
a saint and a sinner,

45:05.310 --> 45:08.709
saints always have a past.

45:08.710 --> 45:10.847
Sinners always have a future.

48:30.980 --> 48:33.879
Hey Avni, I'm not coming into work.

48:33.880 --> 48:35.373
I'll work from home.

48:35.374 --> 48:37.347
What happened?

48:37.348 --> 48:39.118
I can't concentrate.

48:39.119 --> 48:40.739
Oh, don't worry.

48:40.740 --> 48:42.239
See you tomorrow.

48:42.240 --> 48:44.039
Marriage is a great institution,

48:44.040 --> 48:46.527
but I'm not ready for an institution.

52:01.130 --> 52:03.536
Daniel, how are you my dear?

52:03.537 --> 52:05.027
Well.

52:05.028 --> 52:06.028
Well?

52:07.260 --> 52:09.689
It doesn't seem so to me.

52:09.690 --> 52:10.889
Yes.

52:10.890 --> 52:13.573
What are you doing in Barcelona?

52:14.870 --> 52:16.031
I'm listening to music.

52:16.032 --> 52:17.032
Music?

52:19.120 --> 52:20.120
Come on.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.839
If the mountain doesn't go to Mohammed,

52:22.840 --> 52:24.340
Mohammed goes to the mountain.

52:26.421 --> 52:28.691
Take the car and off to Banyoles.

52:28.692 --> 52:30.289
I guess you're right.

52:30.290 --> 52:31.290
Bye.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.543
No, look at this.

53:04.920 --> 53:05.753
Wonderful.

53:05.754 --> 53:07.769
Oh tell me and I'll forget.

53:07.770 --> 53:10.659
Show me and I'll remember.

53:10.660 --> 53:12.859
Involve me and I'll understand.

53:12.860 --> 53:14.633
And what about this?

53:15.920 --> 53:17.149
Too much of a good thing

53:17.150 --> 53:19.213
can be absolutely wonderful.

53:21.100 --> 53:23.759
It's hard to be funny
when you have to be clean.

53:23.760 --> 53:25.029
May West.

53:25.030 --> 53:26.749
When I'm good, I'm very good,

53:26.750 --> 53:30.221
but if I'm bad,
BOTH: I'm better!

53:32.110 --> 53:33.499
Virtue has its own reward

53:33.500 --> 53:36.053
but has no sell at the box office.

53:39.240 --> 53:42.351
How's the "Night To
Remember" show coming along?

53:43.620 --> 53:44.570
After London.

53:44.571 --> 53:46.206
Oh bullshit.

53:46.207 --> 53:48.486
"The audience is wonderfully tolerant."

53:48.487 --> 53:51.369
"It forgives everything except genius."

53:51.370 --> 53:52.330
Oscar Wilde.

53:52.331 --> 53:54.859
You know, you need a new repertoire.

53:54.860 --> 53:56.899
That's what we're discussing.

53:56.900 --> 53:59.059
I could suggest a thing or two.

53:59.060 --> 54:00.619
Go on then.

54:00.620 --> 54:03.807
How 'bout musical numbers and?

54:05.300 --> 54:06.750
I prefer music hall.

54:07.920 --> 54:10.313
Sir Dan or two could be very amusing.

54:12.740 --> 54:16.399
Talking about music hall, do
you know Pascual's wardrobe.

54:16.400 --> 54:18.689
Yes, that's a good idea.

54:18.690 --> 54:21.409
Nothing is more
aggravating than calmness.

54:21.410 --> 54:22.473
Let's give it a try.

57:35.290 --> 57:37.163
Life is like riding a bicycle.

57:38.170 --> 57:40.703
To keep your balance
you have to keep moving.

57:42.650 --> 57:44.603
You're so fortunate to live here.

57:46.150 --> 57:47.763
The winters can be long.

57:49.010 --> 57:51.059
You travel a lot Betsy.

57:51.060 --> 57:54.709
It's a paradise that I
need to escape now and then.

57:54.710 --> 57:56.423
When I come back it's always here.

57:58.618 --> 58:00.023
Oh it's so beautiful.

58:01.270 --> 58:02.853
Sea and mountains.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.543
I must drive back.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:14.189
I don't want to leave you all alone.

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:15.683
I must go to work tomorrow.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.240
Do you still love me?

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:21.570
What about you?

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.410
You didn't give me an answer.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.549
Yes I do.

01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:29.550
A lot.

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:32.083
Sometimes I do.

01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:35.113
You seem like quite the stranger.

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:38.999
There are always ups and downs,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
as the waves.

01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:42.603
But nothing to worry.

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:47.750
I must go.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.539
Each house is a world,

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:57.309
and every person a mystery.

01:01:57.310 --> 01:01:59.259
If you aren't gone too long,

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.919
I'll wait for you here as long as I live.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.320
A friend is what the
heart needs all the time.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.649
Men think that by mouthing hard words

01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:11.239
you get to understand hard things.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.999
Truth is in things, not in words.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.479
If you love life don't waste time.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.723
'Cause time is what life is made of.

01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:23.773
Some things are better than sex.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:26.363
And some are worse.

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:31.520
But there's nothing exactly like it.

01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:06.390
Daniel.

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:08.423
How was Mohammed?

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:10.839
Great.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:11.840
Mm.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.659
A bit difficult.

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:15.493
Don't worry.

01:03:15.493 --> 01:03:16.326
Keep on trying.

01:03:16.327 --> 01:03:18.069
For sure, I'll do.

01:03:18.070 --> 01:03:19.438
Thanks Coco.

01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:47.263
Seriousness is the only
refuge of the shallow.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.939
I am the only person in the world

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:53.643
I should like to know thoroughly.

01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:56.573
Imagination imitates.

01:05:57.470 --> 01:06:01.253
It is the critical
spirit that creates.

01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:06.649
Music is a fantastic

01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:08.393
peacekeeper in this planet.

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:13.859
It is the bedrock of harmony.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:17.429
And a required base for human emotion.

01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:19.639
Freud believed civilization

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.999
had been created under pressure.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.339
Brought by the requirements of life

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:30.083
at the cost of satisfaction
of the instincts.

01:06:42.752 --> 01:06:44.449
So, how did it go?

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:46.289
As usual with my family.

01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:47.290
So-so.

01:06:48.259 --> 01:06:49.949
You know what the Fins are like.

01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:52.029
You are my family.

01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:53.209
I know my love.

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:26.799
Start by doing what's
necessary and what's possible,

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.993
and before you know it,
you're doing the impossible.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:33.929
Mom.

01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:36.029
Hi David, how are you?

01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:37.079
I'm well thanks.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:40.463
Look, how about meeting
for lunch in Empuries?

01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:43.519
Pamela is here.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.663
Just the two of us Mom, please?

01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:48.409
Don't worry, I can
leave Pamela by herself.

01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:50.289
She's very happy here.

01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:52.139
And don't you have any worries?

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:53.793
Not at all my sweetheart.

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:57.719
Hey, give your mother my love.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.393
Avni sends her best.

01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:08.389
How is going everything David?

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:10.538
Well work is going extremely well.

01:12:10.539 --> 01:12:11.649
Ah.

01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:13.069
And everything else?

01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:14.979
I'm learning a lot from Avni.

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:16.309
It's amazing how Indian people are

01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:18.649
so good with modern technology.

01:12:18.650 --> 01:12:20.959
I wasn't asking about work.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.369
So what were you
asking about then mother?

01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:24.869
About Daniel.

01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:26.219
Are you happy together?

01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:27.289
I have the feeling...

01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:29.190
We're not getting on soberly lately.

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:31.773
Do you often meet up?

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:35.289
Now and then but not so much.

01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:36.413
Is it crisis time?

01:12:38.751 --> 01:12:41.129
I just want to find my own way.

01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:43.369
Life brings us these moments.

01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:45.319
You must be patient.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.533
Daniel is such a dear.

01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:49.813
And you're the best mother in the world.

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.509
A crisis is not knowing
what's happening to us

01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:56.012
and that's precisely when it happens.

01:12:56.013 --> 01:12:57.799
It's always possible
to blame someone else

01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.093
so as not to feel guilty for ones self.

01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:02.769
There comes a time in ones life

01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:06.179
when you must take the bull by the horns

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:08.243
and face the facts head on.

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.173
Start every day with a
smile and you'll survive.

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.933
Don't take life too seriously.

01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:13.103
You'll never get out alive.

01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:16.485
It's not what they call you,

01:16:16.486 --> 01:16:17.686
it's what you answer to.

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.279
There's not often that
many people are crazy.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.213
It's only a question of degree.

01:16:24.650 --> 01:16:26.429
And look your best.

01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:27.893
Who said love is blind?

01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:46.739
David, you must go and see Daniel today.

01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:49.609
If I want to be free, it
will have to be tomorrow.

01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:51.513
No, today.

01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:54.349
I'm wondering instead of living.

01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:56.739
No, now.

01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:58.099
Today?

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:01.406
Yes, leave for Barcelona this minute.

01:19:01.407 --> 01:19:02.859
What, do you really think I should?

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:04.429
Yes of course.

01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:05.263
Well...

01:19:05.264 --> 01:19:07.769
The voice in your
head is only a whisper,

01:19:07.770 --> 01:19:10.172
but it won't stop until
you have listened to it.

01:19:10.173 --> 01:19:13.603
I mean, stop fussing
and being so immature.

01:19:16.412 --> 01:19:18.929
And stop searching for
the prince in your life,

01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:20.199
he'd end up somewhere.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.393
You already have one.

01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:24.153
I mean, how can he be so blind?

01:23:38.966 --> 01:23:40.383
Shh, was it good?

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.233
What do you think?

01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:45.999
Better than ever?

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.323
Would you want me back?

01:23:48.219 --> 01:23:49.219
What do you think?

01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:52.853
I feel really good now.

01:23:54.041 --> 01:23:55.041
Oh yeah?

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.263
Some things are better
than sex and some are worse.

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:02.000
But there's nothing exactly like it.

01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:04.693
We'll try some more.

01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:08.679
Mom will be so happy to hear about this.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.680
I'm sure she will.

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:12.633
Kiss me stupid.

01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:23.799
I am so glad I followed your advice.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.189
Sometimes we don't realize

01:24:25.190 --> 01:24:27.999
that how close we are to happiness.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000
What do you mean?

01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:33.119
Ovid, the first great Roman poet

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:35.089
in the era of Augustus said

01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:37.479
that you must not desire
what you don't know.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:39.879
Well that's very wise.

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.880
Yes.

01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:43.469
Life is very straight forward.

01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:45.633
Just stop hanging on yourself so stupidly.

01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:48.393
How did you know?

01:24:49.813 --> 01:24:51.869
Women knows everything sweetheart.

01:24:51.870 --> 01:24:54.079
Now it's time to get on with some work.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.659
Let me call Gilda.

01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:57.619
She left a message.

01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:58.829
Oh just a quickie.

01:24:58.830 --> 01:24:59.830
Okay.

01:25:02.370 --> 01:25:04.913
Oh, I'm so delighted love.

01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:08.780
What's happening?

01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:12.049
I'll tell you later, private ears.

01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:12.883
This is tough time.

01:25:12.884 --> 01:25:14.119
That takeoff.

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.319
Yes.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:16.439
Wonderful, yes.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:20.143
I will phone Maria, and Betsy,
and give 'em the good news!

01:25:21.201 --> 01:25:23.599
And Mika, and Peter, and Coco too!

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.793
You must spread good news quickly.

01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:29.949
I can resist everything
except temptations.

01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:30.950
Which are?

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:35.019
Daniel and David are
back together again!

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:36.609
Let's toast to this!

01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:38.209
Okay, bravo!

01:25:38.210 --> 01:25:39.043
Whiskey!

01:25:39.044 --> 01:25:41.239
And oh, Scotch!

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:45.399
James Joyce, the light
music falling into a glass

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.539
is an agreeable interlude.

01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:51.083
And they live aloud and a love and left.

01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:54.849
Hey, tell me about the coming show

01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:57.063
of MGMC in Calvia.

01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:01.569
Experience is simply a word

01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:04.129
we give to our mistakes.

01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:05.130
Cheers.

01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:10.270
Oh it's Gilda.

01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:13.473
Gilda, how are...

01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:17.947
Really?

01:26:17.948 --> 01:26:18.781
Oh!

01:26:18.781 --> 01:26:19.614
I'm going to vanish.

01:26:19.615 --> 01:26:22.523
If you vanish it means you've
got good news from David.

01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:26.329
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:28.609
Have you got time for a
quick trip to Mallorca?

01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:29.600
What for?

01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:31.629
The great MGMC's show.

01:26:31.630 --> 01:26:34.179
Gilda says we can't miss it.

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:36.553
No, but I'll call Peter and Mika.

01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:41.233
One is very crazy when one is in love.

01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:47.349
Hello.

01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:49.089
Oh hold on Maria.

01:26:49.090 --> 01:26:50.809
Yes, yes, yes we're well.

01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:52.479
Here's Peter.

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:54.083
Hi Maria, how are you doing?

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:57.729
David and Daniel back together again?

01:26:57.730 --> 01:26:58.570
David and Daniel?

01:26:58.571 --> 01:27:00.589
Well they won't be
needing your services now.

01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:02.699
Well that's great news!

01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:04.213
Betsy will be delighted.

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.129
A weekend in Mallorca, now?

01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:08.549
Why?

01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:09.699
MGMC.

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:10.899
Oh I wanna go!

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:12.420
No excuses!

01:27:15.427 --> 01:27:17.109
What song will you choose?

01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:18.463
Irony is a difficult art.

01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:23.369
But if it's very light,
people don't get it.

01:27:23.370 --> 01:27:25.869
And if it's too heavy
it can be crushing.

01:27:25.870 --> 01:27:28.113
Ah, don't keep a man guessing too long.

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.849
He's sure to find the
answer somewhere else.

01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:34.849
The answer my friend, comes from heaven.

01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:36.409
Go to heaven for the climate

01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:38.023
and go to hell for the company.

01:30:50.929 --> 01:30:53.182
Joy is the city's business of heaven.

01:30:53.183 --> 01:30:55.903
In heaven, all the
interesting people are missing.

01:30:57.150 --> 01:31:01.328
Everybody wants to go to
heaven, but nobody wants to die.

01:31:14.139 --> 01:31:17.182
Delete.

01:31:17.183 --> 01:31:18.673
Delete, delete.

01:35:47.410 --> 01:35:50.259
So, will you be coming
to Mallorca Peter?

01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:51.529
Mika will come too.

01:35:51.530 --> 01:35:53.019
I guess he has the time.

01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:55.179
And Coco, she phoned.

01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:57.009
Oh great!

01:35:57.010 --> 01:36:00.669
I'll call Joan and tell him
to prepare something special.

01:36:00.670 --> 01:36:01.879
Something extra?

01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:02.760
Yes.

01:36:02.761 --> 01:36:04.769
Joan and his boys will offer you a tour

01:36:04.770 --> 01:36:07.032
around the north of the island.

01:36:07.033 --> 01:36:10.269
Mallorca with no K, no Germans!

01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:11.103
Oh.

01:36:11.104 --> 01:36:12.859
You just wait and see my dear.

01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:13.919
And Avni and the boys?

01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:15.239
Yes.

01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:16.629
Mama mia.

01:36:16.630 --> 01:36:18.209
It will be great fun.

01:36:18.210 --> 01:36:19.759
Comedy can be a cathartic way

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:22.179
to deal with personal trauma.

01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:25.069
I generally avoid temptation,

01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:26.919
unless I can't resist it.

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.839
Any idea that he's not dangerous

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:31.133
he's unworthy of being
called an idea at all.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Bye dear!

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:59.150
A winner is a dreamer
who never surrenders!

01:38:59.151 --> 01:39:00.417
Brilliant.

01:39:00.418 --> 01:39:02.992
I have.

01:39:02.993 --> 01:39:04.539
Gilda's great.

01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:05.768
Amazing.

01:39:05.769 --> 01:39:07.686
Look, they're crying.

01:39:08.524 --> 01:39:11.748
An actress like Gilda,
would be a huge hit in India.

01:39:11.749 --> 01:39:13.226
In Paris too.

01:39:13.227 --> 01:39:14.504
In London too.

01:39:14.505 --> 01:39:16.199
Everywhere.

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:17.200
Bravo!

01:39:20.748 --> 01:39:21.748
Bravo!

01:39:31.633 --> 01:39:33.299
What do you think of my island?

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:34.579
It's mine too.

01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:37.063
My God, what a great view!

01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:41.969
Study the past if you
want to define the future.

01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:43.869
It's the Mediterranean.

01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:45.529
It's so beautiful.

01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:47.829
There are so many places to visit.

01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:49.989
This is unique.

01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:52.469
If women ran the world,

01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:54.149
they wouldn't have wars.

01:39:54.150 --> 01:39:57.125
Just intense negotiations every 28 days.

01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:01.189
I'm sorry, if you were
right, I'd agree with you.

01:40:01.190 --> 01:40:02.693
Oh really?

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.602
This winter we're going to Sicily.

01:40:05.603 --> 01:40:08.079
Mika, we could join them.

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.409
That's a great idea.

01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:10.390
Can I come too?

01:40:10.391 --> 01:40:11.699
Of course Miss L'Amour.

01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:13.369
It's always great fun with you.

01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:15.059
Thank you, you are such a sweetie.

01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:18.229
Love isn't about how many days,

01:40:18.230 --> 01:40:21.659
weeks, or months you've been together.

01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:25.813
It's about how much you
love each other every day.

01:43:09.050 --> 01:43:14.050
