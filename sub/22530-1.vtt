02:10.977 --> 02:12.512
Come on.

02:31.330 --> 02:33.596
No, no, you're not...
Listen, you can't come through.

02:33.598 --> 02:35.333
Please, I need to say goodbye
to my friend.

02:35.335 --> 02:36.534
- Please?
- Please? Please?

02:36.536 --> 02:38.001
- Go on.
- Thank you. Sorry.

02:38.003 --> 02:40.771
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

02:40.773 --> 02:41.939
Doreen.

02:41.941 --> 02:44.441
- Lou.
- Doreen.

02:44.443 --> 02:46.910
Oh, Ivy.

02:46.912 --> 02:48.879
- Here, for the journey.
- Thank you.

02:48.881 --> 02:51.082
Have they said
where they're sending you?

02:51.084 --> 02:54.051
What, just because your old man
used to live in England?

02:54.053 --> 02:55.922
Because he was born
in England.

02:57.690 --> 02:59.589
- Is there any way round it?
- Nay.

02:59.591 --> 03:01.024
Ivy's Arthur
was born in England.

03:01.026 --> 03:02.760
Only if you're classed
an essential worker,

03:02.762 --> 03:04.394
like a farmer or a manager
or something.

03:04.396 --> 03:05.331
Take care.

03:07.934 --> 03:10.404
First the Jews, now the English.
Who's next?

03:13.038 --> 03:14.872
Lou, look.

03:14.874 --> 03:16.840
More Russians.

03:20.947 --> 03:22.912
What are we going to do?

03:22.914 --> 03:26.384
Arthur's not a farmer.
We'll be on the next boat.

03:26.386 --> 03:29.153
He's not even a manager.
We need to talk to Brian.

03:36.429 --> 03:37.931
Sorry, sir.

03:41.067 --> 03:42.799
It's not that simple, Louisa.

03:42.801 --> 03:44.501
Listen, it is.

03:44.503 --> 03:47.807
Management are exempt,
but it has to be today.

03:50.509 --> 03:54.979
A convenient promotion like that
could easily raise suspicions.

03:54.981 --> 03:57.447
Sir...

03:57.449 --> 03:58.882
if it was just me
I wouldn't ask,

03:58.884 --> 04:00.483
but it's Ivy
and the lad too.

04:00.485 --> 04:03.153
He's only 12.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.956
I hear they're sending
deportees to Germany.

04:05.958 --> 04:07.792
Look, my cousin's son
was locked up last week

04:07.794 --> 04:09.994
just for giving the V-sign
to some Jerry corporal.

04:09.996 --> 04:12.196
All the more reason
that we should stick together,

04:12.198 --> 04:13.700
help each other out.

04:16.935 --> 04:19.572
Like that rabbit I got
for Mary last month.

04:20.971 --> 04:22.973
And the eggs.

04:22.975 --> 04:25.679
And the milk from Rene.

04:27.446 --> 04:28.914
All right.

04:30.015 --> 04:31.818
Thank you, Brian.

04:43.229 --> 04:45.528
Maude. Lily.

04:46.599 --> 04:47.965
What was that?

04:47.967 --> 04:49.600
Probably dynamite
from the quarry.

04:49.602 --> 04:51.235
Jerry's working them late again.

04:51.237 --> 04:53.470
- Those poor Russians.
- What Russians?

04:53.472 --> 04:55.672
Germans are bringing them over
to build more fortifications.

04:55.674 --> 04:58.775
In case Mr. Churchill
ever sends an army to rescue us.

04:58.777 --> 05:00.210
It's not funny, Arthur.

05:00.212 --> 05:02.780
I wasn't being funny, Ivy.

05:02.782 --> 05:04.715
You could have fooled me.

05:04.717 --> 05:07.751
Oh, heaven forbid, dear.

05:07.753 --> 05:09.520
Thank you, Annie.

05:09.522 --> 05:11.222
- Margaret.
- Lou.

05:11.224 --> 05:14.225
Did you get there in time
to say goodbye, Mrs. Gould?

05:14.227 --> 05:15.759
Yes.

05:15.761 --> 05:17.795
Don't ring them up.

05:17.797 --> 05:19.763
Oh, Arthur, let him have a bit.

05:19.765 --> 05:21.165
- He's only 12.
- It's old enough.

05:21.167 --> 05:22.600
- It's only apples.
- Mainly.

05:22.602 --> 05:24.203
Mainly.

05:25.905 --> 05:27.670
Here's to the Jersey
Postal Services

05:27.672 --> 05:29.273
and our new
deputy manager.

05:29.275 --> 05:30.674
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

05:30.676 --> 05:32.542
Thank the Lord.

05:32.544 --> 05:34.210
Do you know, I might
actually sleep tonight.

05:34.212 --> 05:36.045
It's nice to see you
in a suit at last, Arthur.

05:36.047 --> 05:37.514
You've seen me
in a suit before.

05:37.516 --> 05:38.883
Boys, stop it.

05:49.294 --> 05:51.160
Right, who's for some more cake?

05:52.864 --> 05:54.598
I will, Lou, if it's going.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.066
Can I go play outside?

05:56.068 --> 05:58.602
Well, not for long.
Curfew's at 10:00.

05:58.604 --> 06:01.041
And don't you go
too far either, Rex.

06:11.217 --> 06:12.917
One more for Mr. Sweet Tooth?

06:12.919 --> 06:14.651
Don't mind if I do.

06:14.653 --> 06:16.586
How many times did Mum catch you
with the sweet jar?

06:16.588 --> 06:18.054
Oh, and walloped me every time.

06:18.056 --> 06:20.057
And then you wouldn't
stop crying

06:20.059 --> 06:21.792
until Lou took you
to the sweet shop.

06:21.794 --> 06:23.694
You had her wrapped around
your finger, Harold.

06:23.696 --> 06:26.629
Sherbet Dabs.
They were his favorite.

06:26.631 --> 06:29.935
Sherbet Dabs.
Lemon was the best.

06:31.337 --> 06:33.270
BBC was putting
an optimistic spin

06:33.272 --> 06:35.838
on everything
again last night, as usual.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.641
Though if you ask me,
that raid on the Ruhr last week

06:38.643 --> 06:40.713
was a disaster.

06:43.950 --> 06:46.783
Have you heard from either
of the boys, Lou?

06:46.785 --> 06:48.585
Nothing from Ralph.

06:48.587 --> 06:50.020
Got a Red Cross letter
from Ted.

06:50.022 --> 06:52.922
One of his Oxford pals
is on the same ship.

06:52.924 --> 06:54.658
Mind you, it was dated March,

06:54.660 --> 06:56.059
and I heard from Dinah,

06:56.061 --> 06:58.131
and she's had
no news either, so...

07:01.700 --> 07:03.266
Sorry.

07:03.268 --> 07:04.768
It's all right, my love.

07:04.770 --> 07:06.773
You know, he looks after
the good ones.

07:31.664 --> 07:32.799
Rex?

07:34.165 --> 07:35.301
Rex!

08:15.708 --> 08:17.176
Come away.

08:36.961 --> 08:38.962
♪ Who cares for bruises ♪

08:38.964 --> 08:42.799
♪ And soaking wet pants ♪

08:42.801 --> 08:47.070

08:47.072 --> 08:48.240
Lou.

08:50.008 --> 08:52.843
It's Jess Le Cornu.

08:52.845 --> 08:55.478
She's been coming in the shop
since she was a kiddie.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.381
Why these girls do this?

08:57.383 --> 08:59.482
My brother, he says
it's the same in Paris.

08:59.484 --> 09:01.885
Gifts, extra rations.
It's disgraceful.

09:01.887 --> 09:03.753
No, they're too young
to understand.

09:03.755 --> 09:05.923
They just see a handsome face.
And they're hungry.

09:05.925 --> 09:08.458
They're Jerrybags, Lou.
No excuse.

09:08.460 --> 09:12.029
It's the German lads we
should blame, taking advantage.

09:12.031 --> 09:15.198
We mustn't start
turning on our own.

09:15.200 --> 09:19.303
Anyway, we know what rations
she's getting today.

09:19.305 --> 09:20.938
What?

09:20.940 --> 09:22.839
German bratwurst.

09:24.844 --> 09:27.276

Little winkles I chase ♪

09:27.278 --> 09:31.147

- Oh!

09:33.252 --> 09:35.151
Yeah, real tea,
not that bramble stuff.

09:35.153 --> 09:36.920
Give me coffee.

09:36.922 --> 09:39.155
Coffee. Oh, and meat pie.

09:39.157 --> 09:40.790
Like Mum used to make.
Do you remember?

09:40.792 --> 09:42.291
With onion gravy.

09:42.293 --> 09:44.227
- And mash.
- Onion gravy!

09:44.229 --> 09:46.298
- Here, give us the basket.
- Here.

10:09.888 --> 10:11.056
Mrs. Gould.

10:46.124 --> 10:49.258
Our Father, which art in heaven,

10:49.260 --> 10:51.495
hallowed be Thy name.

10:51.497 --> 10:53.030
Thy kingdom come,

10:53.032 --> 10:54.131
Thy will be done

10:54.133 --> 10:57.133
in earth as it is in heaven.

10:57.135 --> 11:00.304
Give us this day our daily bread

11:00.306 --> 11:02.973
and forgive us our trespasses

11:02.975 --> 11:07.144
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

11:07.146 --> 11:10.146
And lead us not into temptation,

11:10.148 --> 11:13.016
but deliver us from evil,

11:13.018 --> 11:15.084
for thine is the kingdom,

11:15.086 --> 11:16.886
the power, and the glory

11:16.888 --> 11:18.988
forever and ever.

11:18.990 --> 11:20.225
Amen.

11:24.296 --> 11:26.496
We heard the Ginns
had been deported last week,

11:26.498 --> 11:28.298
and the Hague family.

11:28.300 --> 11:29.900
Yes, that's terrible,
isn't it?

11:29.902 --> 11:32.001
At least you've been
spared that.

11:32.003 --> 11:34.637
Of course these days,
it's who you know, isn't it?

11:34.639 --> 11:37.940
For everything.

11:37.942 --> 11:39.244
Good evening.

11:40.479 --> 11:42.411
Sylvia asked me
to give you this.

11:42.413 --> 11:45.948
I wasn't sure
you'd even be open.

11:45.950 --> 11:47.420
People still need to eat.

11:49.321 --> 11:51.288
Do you need the rent, Elena?
It's due today.

11:51.290 --> 11:53.993
Oh, don't worry about that.
I'll drop by in the week.

11:56.662 --> 11:58.628
Evening, Rene.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.497
Four and eightpence.

12:01.966 --> 12:03.299
Anything else?

12:03.301 --> 12:05.135
Well...

12:05.137 --> 12:07.237
sorry, Mrs. Gould,
to ask at such a difficult time.

12:07.239 --> 12:09.106
We were just wondering,

12:09.108 --> 12:11.275
what with the rations
being cut again last week...

12:11.277 --> 12:12.976
You want some of my eggs?

12:12.978 --> 12:15.315
Well, if it's not
too much trouble.

12:16.981 --> 12:20.183
Your sister's so kind.

12:20.185 --> 12:21.651
Always gives us eggs
from her own hens.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.487
I don't know what we'd do
without her.

12:23.489 --> 12:25.591
What?

12:34.667 --> 12:36.201
Get some apples.

12:41.205 --> 12:43.442
- Stop it!
- Here, take these.

12:46.678 --> 12:47.980
Take these.

12:52.951 --> 12:54.217
They're just apples!

12:54.219 --> 12:56.388
Back! Back!
Or you prison!

12:59.624 --> 13:01.491
You bastards!

13:01.493 --> 13:06.099
You cold-hearted,
inhuman, stinking bastards!

13:08.032 --> 13:09.601
What are we meant to do?

13:11.135 --> 13:12.969
What the hell
are we meant to do?

17:37.369 --> 17:38.303
What?

17:40.472 --> 17:41.507
Who's this?

17:45.310 --> 17:46.809
What am I to do with him?

18:04.029 --> 18:05.364
Annie.

18:07.032 --> 18:08.565
Thanks, Mattie.

18:08.567 --> 18:10.500
- Afternoon, Mrs. Gould.
- Afternoon.

18:10.502 --> 18:12.534
I'm afraid we're down again
this week.

18:12.536 --> 18:14.037
What do you mean?

18:14.039 --> 18:15.504
Butter is down to two ounces
a week each,

18:15.506 --> 18:17.374
and salt's reduced again.

18:17.376 --> 18:18.974
Mattie, this is ridiculous.

18:18.976 --> 18:21.543
I've got 40 people
registered here for rations.

18:21.545 --> 18:22.878
What am I supposed
to tell them?

18:22.880 --> 18:24.513
I don't make the rules,
Mrs. Gould.

18:24.515 --> 18:25.915
Well, I know for a fact
that Carrefour Stores

18:25.917 --> 18:27.817
had an extra barrel
of flour last week.

18:27.819 --> 18:29.586
We've got an arrangement.
That's not your business.

18:29.588 --> 18:30.753
- You make those rules.
- No.

18:30.755 --> 18:32.388
It is my business

18:32.390 --> 18:35.260
when I can't even supply
my own community.

18:44.069 --> 18:45.605
Louisa.

18:48.307 --> 18:49.873
How are you today?

18:49.875 --> 18:51.607
Your pigs all right?

18:51.609 --> 18:53.376
Yes. Look, I've something
to ask you.

18:53.378 --> 18:54.813
You know the...

18:59.318 --> 19:00.849
I get Jerries in the shop.

19:00.851 --> 19:02.685
I've got to move him
somewhere.

19:02.687 --> 19:04.620
But I'm alone in the house
half the time,

19:04.622 --> 19:06.056
and some of them
are a rough lot.

19:06.058 --> 19:07.723
We've got to stick together,
Louisa.

19:07.725 --> 19:09.826
It's just too dangerous.

19:09.828 --> 19:10.997
I'm sorry.

19:15.966 --> 19:18.403
- He seems to be very animated.
- I don't like it at all.

19:46.764 --> 19:48.365
Leave them.

19:48.367 --> 19:49.933
Let the bastards rot.

19:49.935 --> 19:52.402
They're just young lads.

19:52.404 --> 19:53.802
My brother was shot

19:53.804 --> 19:56.772
after bailing out
of his burning plane.

19:56.774 --> 19:58.540
And we're meant
to show them respect?

19:58.542 --> 20:01.478
Just common decency.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.011
Whose side you on?

20:03.013 --> 20:05.815
Don't you dare!

20:05.817 --> 20:07.149
If we're not better than them,

20:07.151 --> 20:08.717
what are we fighting for?

20:08.719 --> 20:10.153
Elena, that's enough.

20:10.155 --> 20:11.521
How would we want
our boys to be treated

20:11.523 --> 20:12.957
if that happened to them?

20:29.940 --> 20:31.076
Come in.

20:43.955 --> 20:45.925
He won't give you
any trouble.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.136
Are you hungry?

21:31.469 --> 21:32.935
Uh... hm?

21:32.937 --> 21:33.872
Hungry?

22:03.635 --> 22:06.172
Do you speak any English?

22:07.505 --> 22:09.539
English?

22:09.541 --> 22:10.676
Yes.

22:12.109 --> 22:13.545
No...

22:14.846 --> 22:16.812
good.

22:16.814 --> 22:17.949
Bad.

22:19.283 --> 22:20.619
Germans.

22:55.719 --> 22:57.889
Sorry, it's all I've got.

24:20.405 --> 24:22.206
I'll take this down.

24:26.244 --> 24:28.411
That should be addressed to
College House, not the school.

24:28.413 --> 24:31.013
So it will get delayed
a couple of days.

24:31.015 --> 24:32.817
You can always spot them.

24:35.919 --> 24:37.989
They try to disguise
their handwriting.

25:28.939 --> 25:31.339
Repellent.

25:31.341 --> 25:32.774
Why would people do it?

25:32.776 --> 25:35.011
Envy. Jealousy. Fear.

25:35.013 --> 25:37.113
Perhaps they just want
the reward.

25:37.115 --> 25:40.085
But this will get someone
sent to prison.

25:41.252 --> 25:42.788
We have to...

25:44.988 --> 25:46.321
lose it.

25:46.323 --> 25:49.492
We have to deliver the mail,
Arthur.

25:49.494 --> 25:50.960
Yeah, but not letters
like this.

25:50.962 --> 25:53.261
We have to do our job.

25:53.263 --> 25:55.098
I'm sorry, I've got kids
to think about.

25:55.100 --> 25:57.802
So have you.

26:01.371 --> 26:02.840
See it's delivered.

26:24.195 --> 26:25.464
Bed.

26:30.467 --> 26:32.201
Louisa.

26:32.203 --> 26:33.372
Lou.

26:34.773 --> 26:36.140
Lou.

26:37.975 --> 26:40.178
Feodor Polycarpovich Burryi.

26:44.549 --> 26:46.214
Feodor...

26:46.216 --> 26:50.788
No. Feodor Polycarpovich Burryi.

26:52.322 --> 26:53.556
Burryi.

26:53.558 --> 26:55.260
Burryi.

26:56.561 --> 26:57.896
Bill?

26:59.296 --> 27:00.465
Bill?

27:01.800 --> 27:03.335
Bill.

27:05.803 --> 27:06.938
Bill.

27:10.841 --> 27:12.110
Good night, Bill.

27:13.911 --> 27:15.513
Good night, Lou.

28:21.279 --> 28:23.080
Of course. Sorry.

28:37.227 --> 28:41.297
Your lad tried to escape before,
but he was caught.

28:41.299 --> 28:43.299
The guards stripped him naked,

28:43.301 --> 28:45.436
tied him to a concrete post
with barbed wire...

28:46.670 --> 28:48.105
left him all night.

28:50.174 --> 28:52.144
Every week this stuff goes on.

28:54.579 --> 28:56.481
Enough to drive
anyone crazy.

29:00.083 --> 29:01.887
Still, he's got you now.

29:08.559 --> 29:10.995
I know it's asking a lot,
but...

29:12.696 --> 29:14.299
please.

29:28.212 --> 29:30.616
Bring your shirt over tomorrow.
I'll mend it.

30:32.377 --> 30:34.111
Lou?

30:43.286 --> 30:45.087
Who in the devil are you?

30:45.089 --> 30:47.155
- What? What are you saying?
- Arthur! Stop!

30:47.157 --> 30:48.694
This is Bill.

30:51.061 --> 30:52.363
Bill?

30:54.532 --> 30:55.734
Next door.

31:06.744 --> 31:09.345
I'm Rex.

31:09.347 --> 31:10.812
Do you know how dangerous
this is?

31:10.814 --> 31:12.415
Of course.
I haven't slept a wink all week.

31:12.417 --> 31:13.715
You don't know anything
about him.

31:13.717 --> 31:15.283
Some of them
are convicted criminals.

31:15.285 --> 31:16.719
Bill was in
the Russian Air Force.

31:16.721 --> 31:18.820
And he cries at night.
I've heard him.

31:18.822 --> 31:21.690
We're still getting informants'
letters at the sorting office.

31:21.692 --> 31:23.459
Yeah, from townies.
You said so yourself.

31:23.461 --> 31:25.627
People after cash
for black-market food.

31:25.629 --> 31:27.695
Couldn't happen out here.

31:27.697 --> 31:30.433
Half the people in this parish
are related to the other half.

31:30.435 --> 31:31.767
One of the letters I read

31:31.769 --> 31:33.636
was just revenge
for some petty argument.

31:33.638 --> 31:35.303
Look, we all want to do
what we can, but this?

31:35.305 --> 31:38.139
Arthur! You know how
the Jerries treat them.

31:38.141 --> 31:40.209
It's wicked.

31:40.211 --> 31:43.181
God judge me if I can't
do this one thing.

31:53.690 --> 31:55.223
Look.

31:55.225 --> 31:56.727
Good as new.

31:58.361 --> 31:59.561
He saved you a job, Dad.

31:59.563 --> 32:00.796
Good?

32:00.798 --> 32:02.300
Yes, good.

32:05.369 --> 32:07.235
You realize you have to keep
this a total secret.

32:07.237 --> 32:08.803
- You can tell no one.
- Can I tell Derek?

32:08.805 --> 32:11.107
No one.
This stays inside the family.

32:11.109 --> 32:12.640
That applies to all of us.

32:12.642 --> 32:14.779
I'm not daft, Arthur.
Family only.

32:15.812 --> 32:17.178
Ah. Morning, everyone.

32:17.180 --> 32:19.380
Morning.

32:19.382 --> 32:22.386
Nicole is practically family.

32:23.855 --> 32:25.887
Toge...

32:25.889 --> 32:27.522
- "Ther."
- ...ther.

32:27.524 --> 32:29.224
- Together.
- "Togezzer."

32:29.226 --> 32:31.559
- Together.
- Together.

32:31.561 --> 32:32.895
Uh-huh.

32:32.897 --> 32:35.664
With an...

32:35.666 --> 32:37.133
-...effort.

32:37.135 --> 32:38.600
Very good.

32:38.602 --> 32:40.469
Your brother dropped this off,
Mrs. Gould.

32:40.471 --> 32:42.404
Said he couldn't stop.

32:42.406 --> 32:44.572
Annie, this is Bill.

32:44.574 --> 32:46.544
Bill, Annie.

32:51.815 --> 32:53.549
Thank you, my love.

32:53.551 --> 32:54.820
Thank you.

32:57.821 --> 33:00.255
It's from my brother.

33:00.257 --> 33:03.291
- Ah, Harold.
- Yeah.

33:04.896 --> 33:07.163
Thank him.

33:07.165 --> 33:08.430
I will.

33:08.432 --> 33:09.831
How do you say it
in Russian?

33:09.833 --> 33:12.434
Spasiba.

33:12.436 --> 33:14.470
- Spasiba.
- Good.

33:30.321 --> 33:31.755
- Hello, Mrs. Gould.
- We're closed.

33:32.790 --> 33:34.559
It is not as you think.

33:37.794 --> 33:39.263
I care for her.

33:40.531 --> 33:42.431
And I'm not a Nazi.

33:42.433 --> 33:44.269
We're closed.

33:46.236 --> 33:47.536
Get out.

33:47.538 --> 33:50.609
Get out! Go on. Go on.

34:12.230 --> 34:14.395
What are you doing here?

34:14.397 --> 34:16.699
Sorry. Sorry.

34:16.701 --> 34:21.237
Before war,
I go to school in Moscow.

34:21.239 --> 34:22.907
Moscow. I...

34:25.342 --> 34:26.507
Art school?

34:26.509 --> 34:27.745
Yes.

34:29.313 --> 34:30.681
Sorry.

34:32.282 --> 34:34.552
Your mother must be so worried
about you.

34:40.590 --> 34:43.491
Belonged to my husband.

34:43.493 --> 34:44.626
You can look at it
if you like.

34:44.628 --> 34:46.462
Yes.

34:46.464 --> 34:49.266
But don't come in this room,
understood?

34:50.900 --> 34:52.670
Yes. Sorry.

34:54.371 --> 34:55.706
Thank you.

35:02.013 --> 35:03.612
"'Beg your pardon, '
said the mole,

35:03.614 --> 35:07.282
pulling himself together
with an effort.

35:07.284 --> 35:09.351
'You must think me very rude,

35:09.353 --> 35:12.420
but all this is so new to me.

35:12.422 --> 35:15.858
So this is a river.'"

35:15.860 --> 35:19.460
"'The river, '
corrected the rat."

35:19.462 --> 35:21.630
I've locked up for tonight,
Mrs. Gould.

35:21.632 --> 35:23.699
- Thank you, Annie.
- Good night.

35:23.701 --> 35:25.433
Well done, Bill.

35:25.435 --> 35:27.004
Thank you.

35:30.775 --> 35:33.808
"'And you really live
by the river?

35:33.810 --> 35:36.580
What a jolly life.'"

36:23.527 --> 36:24.963
You move.

36:26.496 --> 36:28.429
I can't sit still all night.

36:28.431 --> 36:30.301
You wait till
you're my age.

36:32.502 --> 36:34.038
Can I see it yet?

36:51.589 --> 36:53.458
You like this song?

36:54.525 --> 36:56.090
I sang it with Ted.

36:56.092 --> 36:57.728
Last time he was here.

37:02.065 --> 37:03.734
You know, in this light...

37:11.641 --> 37:12.708
- Come on, let me have a look.
- No.

37:12.710 --> 37:14.913
Come on. Come on.

37:19.784 --> 37:21.550
Oh, Bill, it's wonderful.

37:21.552 --> 37:22.754
Yes?

37:24.087 --> 37:26.154
You made me look younger.

37:28.092 --> 37:29.590
Is what I see.

37:29.592 --> 37:32.494
You have a real talent.

37:32.496 --> 37:34.762
It's a gift from God.

37:34.764 --> 37:35.967
God?

37:37.567 --> 37:38.802
I don't think.

37:41.172 --> 37:42.737
You don't believe in God?

37:42.739 --> 37:46.610
If there is God,
why my friends die? Huh?

37:47.645 --> 37:49.511
Innocent people. Children.

37:49.513 --> 37:51.447
Why God do nothing?

37:51.449 --> 37:53.514
Because there's also evil.

37:53.516 --> 37:54.849
But if you believe
and if you pray...

37:54.851 --> 37:58.119
Boy in quarry, 16, he pray.

37:58.121 --> 38:01.556
He pray every night.
Now? Now dead!

38:01.558 --> 38:03.224
Where is God? Huh?

38:03.226 --> 38:05.092
When Germans beating,
where is God?

38:05.094 --> 38:06.962
- Bill, calm down.
- Men still in camp.

38:06.964 --> 38:09.730
Slaves! Where is God?
When your son die, where is God?

38:09.732 --> 38:12.634
- Don't you mention Ted.
- Maybe God not love your son?

38:12.636 --> 38:14.469
- No, don't you mention Ted.
- God not help us.

38:14.471 --> 38:15.938
- To hell with God!
- Don't blaspheme in my house.

38:15.940 --> 38:17.809
- Hell with God!
- No, that...

38:20.143 --> 38:22.045
Bill, stop it.
That's enough.

38:25.549 --> 38:26.985
Go to your room.

39:53.304 --> 39:54.639
Bill?

39:58.676 --> 40:00.011
Bill?

40:01.946 --> 40:03.081
Bill?

40:09.652 --> 40:10.788
Bill?

41:10.114 --> 41:11.913
It's only down St. Aubins.

41:11.915 --> 41:13.982
It's not far.
We won't be out long.

41:13.984 --> 41:16.784
- I'm not sure.
- We'll be fine. Don't worry.

41:16.786 --> 41:17.953
It's too dangerous.

41:17.955 --> 41:19.286
So is going crackers.

41:19.288 --> 41:21.690
Cooped up like an animal
for three months.

41:21.692 --> 41:23.058
We can't go on like this.

41:23.060 --> 41:24.893
- What if Germans stop us?
- They won't.

41:24.895 --> 41:26.962
It's not far,
and we'll take the back lanes.

41:26.964 --> 41:28.933
We'll be fine.
Really, we will.

41:44.714 --> 41:46.915
Morning, Elena.

41:46.917 --> 41:48.987
- Chilly today.
- Yeah, a bit, isn't it?

41:50.688 --> 41:51.856
Morning.

42:24.054 --> 42:25.990
It's right at the top, Bill.

42:36.833 --> 42:38.032
Come on.

43:03.326 --> 43:04.793
Where did you get these?

43:04.795 --> 43:06.128
From a friend.

43:06.130 --> 43:08.299
Must be a very good friend.

43:09.866 --> 43:11.500
Yes, he is.

43:11.502 --> 43:14.038
No, I think you bought them
illegally.

44:30.848 --> 44:32.279
Those invoices for tomorrow?

44:32.281 --> 44:35.018
They're on my desk.

44:36.886 --> 44:37.985
Want a coffee?

44:37.987 --> 44:39.322
No, thanks.

45:13.891 --> 45:15.556
Never seen you before.

45:15.558 --> 45:17.360
You a friend of Harold's?

45:23.100 --> 45:24.235
Cat got your tongue?

45:25.502 --> 45:27.404
He's got nothing
to say to you.

45:31.241 --> 45:33.308
I think the price
just went up.

45:33.310 --> 45:35.043
This is what we agreed.

45:35.045 --> 45:36.313
You haven't been honest with me.

45:38.047 --> 45:39.850
You're a teacher,
aren't you, Harold?

45:40.918 --> 45:43.918
You know I am.

45:43.920 --> 45:46.454
My daughter's got her exams
coming up.

45:46.456 --> 45:48.989
She's a bright kid,
but she's been ill a lot.

45:48.991 --> 45:50.194
She needs a little help.

45:52.228 --> 45:53.661
I'll see what I can do.

45:53.663 --> 45:55.230
You'll do better than that.

45:55.232 --> 45:57.101
You'll make sure
she does all right.

46:00.636 --> 46:01.972
Very well.

46:13.417 --> 46:15.953
Don't all leave together.

46:44.181 --> 46:46.047
Shop all shut up, Annie?

46:46.049 --> 46:47.315
Yes, Mrs. Gould.

46:47.317 --> 46:48.583
- See you tomorrow.
- See you then.

46:48.585 --> 46:50.521
- Good night.
- Good night.

46:55.458 --> 46:57.759
I've been thinking.

46:57.761 --> 46:59.994
Perhaps we should go
to St. Heliers.

46:59.996 --> 47:01.295
The town?

47:01.297 --> 47:03.030
Yes. There's a bus on Friday.

47:03.032 --> 47:04.264
Not much in the shops,

47:04.266 --> 47:06.567
but we could have
a wander round.

47:06.569 --> 47:09.204
- We might get you a book.
- Lots of soldiers in town.

47:09.206 --> 47:11.072
Well, it's all right.
You got your identity card now.

47:11.074 --> 47:12.607
Yes, but if I speak,
they know I'm Russian.

47:12.609 --> 47:14.442
- What we do?
- I'll do all the talking.

47:14.444 --> 47:17.112
We can teach you a few French
words, just in case.

47:17.114 --> 47:19.581
We can say you're my nephew
from St. Mary's.

47:19.583 --> 47:21.715
Lots of those country farmers
speak hardly any English.

47:21.717 --> 47:23.717
- No, no, no.
- Bill...

47:23.719 --> 47:25.453
Bill, it's not good for you

47:25.455 --> 47:28.391
being stuck all the time
in this house.

47:34.230 --> 47:37.400
Every Friday Ivy and I
bring the fruit down.

47:43.806 --> 47:46.174
Just relax.

47:46.176 --> 47:47.978
Everything's fine.

48:17.840 --> 48:19.340
- Good morning.
- Morning.

48:19.342 --> 48:20.842
All right if we browse a little?

48:20.844 --> 48:22.610
Of course.

48:22.612 --> 48:24.014
Go on.

48:30.853 --> 48:32.622
Ah, Kandinsky.

48:34.257 --> 48:35.426
I go ask.

48:37.194 --> 48:38.628
Please...

48:41.130 --> 48:42.366
French.

48:55.212 --> 48:56.643
How much is it?

48:56.645 --> 48:59.313
Oh, in this condition,
five shillings.

48:59.315 --> 49:00.750
We'll take it.

49:07.389 --> 49:08.759
Five shillings, Bill.

49:09.826 --> 49:11.061
In your wallet.

49:12.395 --> 49:14.165
My nephew loves art.

49:29.246 --> 49:31.182
He's just had a fight
with his girl.

49:33.315 --> 49:35.518
- Thank you, madam.
- Thank you.

49:43.192 --> 49:44.794
Two and six, please.

49:48.264 --> 49:50.364
Are they locals?

49:50.366 --> 49:53.103
Never seen them before.

50:01.210 --> 50:04.212
Bill. Bill. Slow down.

50:04.214 --> 50:06.880
Slow down. Just relax.

50:06.882 --> 50:08.382
It's all right.

50:08.384 --> 50:09.583
Nobody's chasing us.

50:09.585 --> 50:11.286
Let's go and have a look

50:11.288 --> 50:12.786
and see if there's any fish
in the market.

50:12.788 --> 50:14.188
- No.
- But we've got half an hour

50:14.190 --> 50:15.657
before the bus goes.

50:15.659 --> 50:17.759
- Just relax.
- All right.

50:29.639 --> 50:31.471
Louisa.

50:31.473 --> 50:33.373
How are you keeping?

50:33.375 --> 50:35.845
All right,
thank you, Brian.

50:36.980 --> 50:38.313
You?

50:38.315 --> 50:39.581
Oh, I mustn't grumble.

50:39.583 --> 50:42.616
I'm so sorry about Ted.

50:42.618 --> 50:44.851
Oh, yes, thank you.

50:44.853 --> 50:47.288
Yeah, very hard for you.

50:47.290 --> 50:50.491
Well, it's nice to see
you've got some company, Lou.

50:50.493 --> 50:52.626
Yes.

50:52.628 --> 50:55.232
And why not?
Good luck to you.

50:57.601 --> 50:59.366
Well, I've got to dash,

50:59.368 --> 51:00.534
so...

51:00.536 --> 51:01.705
au revoir.

51:05.808 --> 51:07.375
He think that...?

51:07.377 --> 51:09.744
Yes, he definitely think.

51:09.746 --> 51:12.512
Well, he has big oily head.

51:12.514 --> 51:13.715
What?

51:13.717 --> 51:16.384
Oily head. In here.
To think.

51:16.386 --> 51:17.985
A dirty mind?

51:19.355 --> 51:21.422
Bill. Big oily head!

51:25.295 --> 51:27.364
Okay, just start walking.

51:29.331 --> 51:31.299
Don't do that.

51:31.301 --> 51:33.400
- What I do?
- Just be normal.

51:33.402 --> 51:35.969
- No, I must run.
- No. If you run, we're finished.

51:35.971 --> 51:37.740
Hey! Stop!

51:46.750 --> 51:47.985
You.

51:49.685 --> 51:51.388
You left this.

51:53.355 --> 51:54.922
In the shop.

51:54.924 --> 51:56.824
Oh! Thank you.

51:56.826 --> 51:59.330
Thank you very much.
You're very kind.

52:02.331 --> 52:03.667
Here.

52:05.368 --> 52:06.570
Bill?

52:07.569 --> 52:08.972
Are you all right?

52:18.348 --> 52:19.681
Oh, Bill.

52:19.683 --> 52:22.317
- Oh, my love.
- Sorry.

52:23.353 --> 52:24.788
It's all right.

52:37.433 --> 52:38.901
Hello, Bill.

52:42.906 --> 52:44.440
How did it go?

52:45.507 --> 52:47.407
I could do with a cuppa.

52:47.409 --> 52:48.608
Everything all right here?

52:48.610 --> 52:49.946
Shop's been quiet all day.

52:52.614 --> 52:54.681
Thursday we should get
through the end of the month.

52:54.683 --> 52:56.516
- Lovely. Lovely.
- Just.

52:56.518 --> 52:58.386
Hey, if you're walking by,

52:58.388 --> 52:59.753
will you pick us
some bramble leaves?

52:59.755 --> 53:01.489
- Absolutely.
- Hello, Ivy.

53:01.491 --> 53:03.424
- All right, my love?
- Yes.

53:03.426 --> 53:05.561
- Sorry for before.
- That's all right.

53:11.400 --> 53:13.837
There you are.
That will warm you up.

53:22.978 --> 53:24.348
Mm.

53:27.683 --> 53:29.852
Where is Annie?
Is she sick?

53:35.725 --> 53:39.330
Annie got a job in
the Summerland factory in town.

53:42.531 --> 53:43.831
She won't be working here
anymore.

53:43.833 --> 53:45.465
Will she not come back?

53:45.467 --> 53:47.000
Well, it's better pay,
apparently.

53:47.002 --> 53:50.971
But Ivy will fill in whilst
I look for someone else.

53:50.973 --> 53:53.407
I must say goodbye.

53:53.409 --> 53:55.742
Well, actually she's moved
to her sister's at First Tower.

53:55.744 --> 53:57.878
It's more convenient.

53:57.880 --> 53:59.982
So we may not see her for a bit.

54:10.927 --> 54:12.463
Oh, dear.

54:13.596 --> 54:15.431
It's for the best, Lou.

54:40.723 --> 54:42.223
- Lou.
- What you doing here?

54:42.225 --> 54:44.224
I said I'd be back in an hour.

54:44.226 --> 54:46.429
Letter come for you.

54:47.464 --> 54:48.965
Red Cross letter.

55:08.985 --> 55:11.052
Oh, thank God.

55:11.054 --> 55:12.219
Thank God.

55:12.221 --> 55:13.753
- It's from Ralph?
- Yes.

55:15.592 --> 55:18.492
It says, "Darling Mum, all well.
Keeping busy."

55:19.728 --> 55:21.128
"Hope same there.

55:21.130 --> 55:22.829
Miss your ormer stew.

55:22.831 --> 55:25.565
Chin up.
World will sing again soon.

55:25.567 --> 55:27.768
Your ever-loving Ralph."

55:27.770 --> 55:29.603
He remember your song?

55:29.605 --> 55:31.572
- Yes.
- Is good letter.

55:31.574 --> 55:32.773
It's wonderful.

55:32.775 --> 55:34.808
It's wonderful!

55:34.810 --> 55:37.978
Oh, it's four months
out of date, but...

55:37.980 --> 55:39.980
He is fine.

55:39.982 --> 55:42.785
I know, in here.

55:46.556 --> 55:47.891
Thank you.

55:54.029 --> 55:56.600
Come. We work.
I help you.

57:43.406 --> 57:44.871
A Christmas message
from Mr. Churchill.

57:44.873 --> 57:46.944
Rather have a food parcel.

57:51.813 --> 57:53.713
Bye-bye. Merry Christmas.

57:53.715 --> 57:54.715
See you.

57:56.085 --> 57:58.119
Anything else, madam?

57:58.121 --> 58:01.021
Ah, there you are.
Give me five minutes.

58:04.293 --> 58:05.793
Have a lovely Christmas.

58:05.795 --> 58:07.161
Happy Christmas to you.

58:07.163 --> 58:08.395
And you too Bill.

58:08.397 --> 58:09.864
Take care, Elena.

58:09.866 --> 58:11.799
Merry Christmas, ladies.

58:11.801 --> 58:12.933
Goodbye, Merry Christmas,
ladies.

58:12.935 --> 58:14.402
Merry Christmas, ladies.

58:14.404 --> 58:16.005
See to Mattie, Bill.

58:17.674 --> 58:19.273
Five, yes? Five bottles?

58:19.275 --> 58:21.612
- Four.
- Four. Good.

58:22.844 --> 58:25.346
Oh, hello, Arthur.

58:25.348 --> 58:26.980
Bill.

58:26.982 --> 58:28.683
- Mattie, how are you?
- Good. Good.

58:28.685 --> 58:29.983
That cough any better?

58:29.985 --> 58:31.686
Much better, yeah,
thank you...

58:31.688 --> 58:32.786
Come on, Arthur!

58:32.788 --> 58:34.688
Christmas starts here!

58:34.690 --> 58:35.889
You too, mate.

58:35.891 --> 58:38.391
Hello, Harold, just in time.

58:38.393 --> 58:39.726
Cheer up, Arthur.

58:39.728 --> 58:42.063
It's Christmas.

58:42.065 --> 58:43.697
Rex, could you help me, please?

58:43.699 --> 58:45.301
- Yes.
- Thank you.

58:47.804 --> 58:49.369
There we go. Perfect.

58:49.371 --> 58:52.038
Come on, boys.
Let's go and cheer Arthur up.

58:52.040 --> 58:54.308
Rex, can you sing us a carol?

58:54.310 --> 58:56.744
I can play you one. I can play,
"Good King Wenceslas."

58:56.746 --> 58:58.212
Oh, that's perfect.

58:58.214 --> 58:59.846
Merry Christmas, Bill.

58:59.848 --> 59:01.449
What if the Jerries
come in the shop?

59:01.451 --> 59:03.483
He slips into the back.
There's no risk.

59:03.485 --> 59:05.453
Ivy, half the parish
know him by name,

59:05.455 --> 59:07.721
and the other half probably know
exactly where he came from.

59:07.723 --> 59:09.290
- From where they came.
- From where they came.

59:09.292 --> 59:10.858
And don't you raise
your voice to me.

59:10.860 --> 59:12.860
- Lou.
- Hello, Arthur.

59:12.862 --> 59:15.395
- Would you be Father Christmas?
- Yes, love to.

59:20.936 --> 59:23.306
You all right, my love?

59:27.243 --> 59:28.742
Yes, I am.

59:28.744 --> 59:30.411
Good.

59:30.413 --> 59:31.982
- Top up?
- Yes.

59:33.281 --> 59:34.782
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

59:34.784 --> 59:36.317
I go show Lou.

59:36.319 --> 59:38.251
Lou, look.

59:38.253 --> 59:40.757
- From Harold.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

59:42.190 --> 59:44.991
"Merry Christmas, Feodor,
from Harold."

59:44.993 --> 59:46.295
He write in Russian.

59:47.764 --> 59:49.929
Right, everybody.

59:49.931 --> 59:53.099
The king's Christmas toast.

59:53.101 --> 59:54.902
- God bless the king.
- God bless Rene's pig.

59:56.339 --> 59:58.404
And to our extended
curfew tonight.

59:58.406 --> 01:00:02.009
And to victory and liberation
in 1944.

01:00:02.011 --> 01:00:04.078
Liberation.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.478
Can Bill sing
that Russian song?

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.114
Come on, my love.
Come on.

01:00:07.116 --> 01:00:09.418
Come on.

01:00:39.982 --> 01:00:41.317
Bill.

01:00:42.884 --> 01:00:44.487
I'll hide the pork.

01:01:02.038 --> 01:01:03.773
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.373
Are you having a party?

01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:08.909
- Yes, my family.
- We hear singing.

01:01:08.911 --> 01:01:11.011
Well, of course.
It's Christmas.

01:01:11.013 --> 01:01:12.815
Russian singing.

01:01:15.183 --> 01:01:16.983
You are Jersey family, yeah?

01:01:16.985 --> 01:01:20.022
You know Russian songs?

01:01:22.458 --> 01:01:24.090
- We like them.
- We must search property.

01:01:24.092 --> 01:01:25.027
What?

01:01:26.328 --> 01:01:28.329
No, it's Christmas Eve.

01:01:28.331 --> 01:01:29.864
There's a child here.

01:01:29.866 --> 01:01:31.065
Do you want
to scare him to death?

01:01:31.067 --> 01:01:32.132
Stand aside, please.

01:01:52.388 --> 01:01:55.058
Good evening, gentlemen.
What seems to be the problem?

01:01:57.058 --> 01:01:59.626
You are family?
What's your name?

01:01:59.628 --> 01:02:02.299
Harold Le Druillenec,
Trinity Street, St. Savior.

01:02:03.398 --> 01:02:04.898
My sister.

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.335
I gather my singing
has impressed you.

01:02:07.502 --> 01:02:09.203
You know Russian?

01:02:09.205 --> 01:02:10.971
I'm a teacher.

01:02:10.973 --> 01:02:12.576
Care to join us for a rendition
of "O Tannenbaum"?

01:02:18.179 --> 01:02:20.514
We have inspections.

01:02:20.516 --> 01:02:22.215
Good night.

01:02:22.217 --> 01:02:23.650
To you, too.

01:02:23.652 --> 01:02:26.055
Merry Christmas.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.559
Harold, you're a bloody genius.

01:02:33.561 --> 01:02:36.063
Thank the Lord for
a Russian pal in college.

01:02:36.065 --> 01:02:38.998
And Calvados.

01:02:44.674 --> 01:02:46.105
It's all right, Bill.

01:02:46.107 --> 01:02:47.910
They've gone.

01:02:50.045 --> 01:02:51.945
And what if the wrong person
sees him?

01:02:51.947 --> 01:02:54.280
Six of those letters I've weeded
out in the last month.

01:02:54.282 --> 01:02:56.583
Arthur, of course there's
a few bad apples.

01:02:56.585 --> 01:02:58.552
Lou's not at risk.

01:02:58.554 --> 01:03:00.520
You realize if they find him,

01:03:00.522 --> 01:03:02.056
we could all go down.

01:03:02.058 --> 01:03:03.257
Just calm down, Arthur.

01:03:03.259 --> 01:03:05.058
And what about Ralph?

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:06.726
He's already lost his father
and his brother.

01:03:06.728 --> 01:03:09.329
I'd want any mother
to do the same for Ralph.

01:03:09.331 --> 01:03:11.331
Why do you think
I'm doing this?

01:03:11.333 --> 01:03:13.967
- Oh, I'm beginning to wonder.
- Please.

01:03:13.969 --> 01:03:15.969
I am sorry.

01:03:15.971 --> 01:03:18.040
I will not make problems
with your family.

01:03:19.741 --> 01:03:21.442
No, don't go.

01:03:21.444 --> 01:03:22.978
Oh, now look
what you've done.

01:03:24.313 --> 01:03:26.212
Congratulations, Arthur.

01:03:26.214 --> 01:03:28.081
Why did you say
those things?

01:03:28.083 --> 01:03:30.116
Because someone had to.

01:03:30.118 --> 01:03:32.353
But you've upset everyone.

01:03:32.355 --> 01:03:33.619
And for what?

01:03:33.621 --> 01:03:35.355
I mean, you heard
what Harold said.

01:03:35.357 --> 01:03:37.056
- Yeah, don't we always.
- Oh...

01:03:37.058 --> 01:03:38.525
Bill trusts us.

01:03:38.527 --> 01:03:40.194
This is the only place
he feels safe.

01:03:40.196 --> 01:03:41.695
It's all right, just calm...

01:03:41.697 --> 01:03:43.066
And you're driving him away.

01:03:46.067 --> 01:03:47.403
Well, Merry Christmas
one and all.

01:03:50.005 --> 01:03:53.306
Oh, come on, you can't take
any notice of Arthur.

01:03:53.308 --> 01:03:55.442
What if he's right?

01:03:55.444 --> 01:03:57.744
I would never let anything
happen to you.

01:03:57.746 --> 01:04:00.114
Yeah? And you? If you go
to prison because of me?

01:04:00.116 --> 01:04:01.547
Well, it couldn't be
any worse

01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:03.349
than rattling around this house
on my own.

01:04:03.351 --> 01:04:05.184
I know German prisons.
It's no joke.

01:04:05.186 --> 01:04:08.288
No one is going to prison.

01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:10.023
To take risk is stupid.

01:04:10.025 --> 01:04:12.058
I ask Rene, he know people,
other places I can stay.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.629
No, this is your home.

01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:17.199
It's our home.

01:04:20.168 --> 01:04:22.402
Here's your Christmas present.

01:04:22.404 --> 01:04:25.140
It's a Jersey penny.
It's very old and very rare.

01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:29.679
I gave it to Ted once.

01:04:31.112 --> 01:04:32.715
Now it's yours.

01:04:36.152 --> 01:04:38.088
Please stay.

01:05:01.543 --> 01:05:03.110
But, please, Mrs. Gould,

01:05:03.112 --> 01:05:04.844
we had no dinner at all
last night.

01:05:04.846 --> 01:05:06.480
But I can't help that.

01:05:06.482 --> 01:05:08.415
You had your rations
two days ago.

01:05:08.417 --> 01:05:10.183
You must have a few carrots
in the back.

01:05:10.185 --> 01:05:14.087
Well, what about coal?
We can't even boil water.

01:05:14.089 --> 01:05:16.322
No fuel was delivered last week.

01:05:16.324 --> 01:05:18.692
I wish I could help you.
I really do.

01:05:18.694 --> 01:05:20.694
But I'm afraid we are
all in the same boat.

01:05:20.696 --> 01:05:23.197
Oh, easier for some though, eh?

01:05:23.199 --> 01:05:25.331
People with friends.

01:05:25.333 --> 01:05:28.869
We've seen you with that Mattie,
getting extra bread.

01:05:28.871 --> 01:05:31.105
Now that's illegal, isn't it?

01:05:31.107 --> 01:05:32.438
Now that's enough.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.373
Lily, take your sister home,
please.

01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:36.143
- And another thing...
- Maude, come, come, come on.

01:05:36.145 --> 01:05:37.547
There's no point.

01:05:49.625 --> 01:05:53.696
If I come to church with you,
will it make you feel better?

If you want, I try to find
some driftwood.

01:06:48.551 --> 01:06:50.183
No we'll go together
this afternoon.

01:06:50.185 --> 01:06:52.552
- Yes.
- You made it. Wasn't that bad.

01:06:52.554 --> 01:06:55.288

- Yes, I like. I like singing.

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:57.257
I want you to move Bill
somewhere else.

01:06:57.259 --> 01:06:58.692
What are you talking about?

01:06:58.694 --> 01:07:00.826
Young William Dauney, last week?
Only 17.

01:07:00.828 --> 01:07:03.297
Deported just for stealing
some Jerry boots.

01:07:03.299 --> 01:07:04.764
What's that got to do with me?

01:07:04.766 --> 01:07:06.900
They arrested everyone
connected with him.

01:07:06.902 --> 01:07:09.703
La Fontaine is my property.
If anything happened...

01:07:09.705 --> 01:07:11.771
You're playing straight
into Jerry's hands.

01:07:11.773 --> 01:07:14.308
The smallest crime and you're
shipped straight off to Germany.

01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:16.375
I'm too old to go
to some foreign prison.

01:07:16.377 --> 01:07:18.881
I hear they don't even
have proper lavvies.

01:07:20.248 --> 01:07:21.581
Oh, I'll move him.

01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:23.152
It's for your own good.

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:26.320
What are you staring at,
Jerrybag?

01:07:26.322 --> 01:07:28.355
Your dad would be ashamed
of you.

01:07:28.357 --> 01:07:30.456
Don't you dare
say that to me.

01:07:30.458 --> 01:07:31.824
He was a good man.

01:07:31.826 --> 01:07:34.228
You are a disgrace
to his memory.

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:35.728
Shut up, you old cow!

01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:38.264
My Friedrich
didn't kill your son.

- Lou.
- Lou.

01:07:44.373 --> 01:07:46.306
- What happened?
- Nothing.

01:07:46.308 --> 01:07:48.976
We're just all
too bloody hungry.

01:07:48.978 --> 01:07:50.844
Need some cheering up.

01:07:57.518 --> 01:07:58.918
You'll be all right.
You're one of us.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.355
You're a Jersey boy now.

01:08:03.392 --> 01:08:04.690
I love a bit of music.

Arthur, got an officer
from Field Command here.

01:09:12.794 --> 01:09:15.764
Wants to see
our employees' register.

01:09:16.898 --> 01:09:18.863
Sorry?

01:09:18.866 --> 01:09:21.036
It's just a routine check.
Can you deal with it?

01:09:27.776 --> 01:09:29.946
Now, please.

01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:32.481
Yes, of course.

01:09:35.417 --> 01:09:36.886
Of course.

01:09:39.721 --> 01:09:43.390
"Smith, Sungold,
Richards, Taylor..."

01:09:46.627 --> 01:09:47.563
Good.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.134
I'm sorry, I don't speak...

01:09:54.136 --> 01:09:55.772
German.

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:02.645
Ah, yeah.

01:10:06.414 --> 01:10:07.783
1940.

01:10:13.755 --> 01:10:16.422
Will this take
very much longer?

01:10:24.732 --> 01:10:26.733
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:10:26.735 --> 01:10:27.904
If you'll excuse me.

01:10:31.005 --> 01:10:32.575
Ah, right.

01:10:48.022 --> 01:10:50.122
Don't worry, Arthur.

01:10:50.124 --> 01:10:52.027
It's been delivered.

01:10:56.097 --> 01:10:58.734
You have no idea
what you've just done.

01:11:06.909 --> 01:11:08.608
Hey, Nicole,

01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:11.577
the blackout needs doing
in the kitchen.

01:11:11.579 --> 01:11:13.447
Arthur, what's happened?

01:11:13.449 --> 01:11:15.015
What are you doing here?

01:11:15.017 --> 01:11:18.618
We need to get rid of everything
to do with Bill.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:21.188
And the wireless.
Everything, Lou.

01:11:21.190 --> 01:11:22.991
- Now!
- Oh, my goodness.

01:11:28.864 --> 01:11:31.096
Clear out your flat first thing
tomorrow, Nicole.

01:11:31.098 --> 01:11:34.201
And Harold. Both your names
were on that list.

01:11:34.203 --> 01:11:35.635
You'll have to warn him.

01:11:35.637 --> 01:11:37.507
Right.

01:12:58.553 --> 01:12:59.855
Hello?

01:13:12.834 --> 01:13:14.868
They're here.

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:16.235
It'll only be for a bit.

01:13:16.237 --> 01:13:17.906
The Allies will be here
any day now.

01:13:31.152 --> 01:13:32.788
Mattie.

01:13:33.621 --> 01:13:34.990
Bill.

01:13:40.195 --> 01:13:41.760
Where are you taking him?

01:13:41.762 --> 01:13:43.697
We'll look after him,
Mrs. Gould.

01:13:43.699 --> 01:13:44.997
But how will I contact him?

01:13:44.999 --> 01:13:46.966
You can't. I'm sorry.

01:13:46.968 --> 01:13:50.172
Bill, 50 yards behind, yes?

01:13:55.343 --> 01:13:56.779
Go.

01:14:04.085 --> 01:14:05.620
Thank you.

01:14:06.989 --> 01:14:08.590
Go, go, go.

01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:37.852
Over, over.

01:15:12.754 --> 01:15:13.787
Come on.

01:15:13.789 --> 01:15:15.124
Pick up the bikes.

01:15:40.481 --> 01:15:42.415
Good morning, Mrs. Gould.

01:15:42.417 --> 01:15:47.453
I'm sorry, I have to search
your property.

01:15:47.455 --> 01:15:50.122
You're wasting your time.

01:15:50.124 --> 01:15:52.261
But I suppose
you're used to that.

01:15:53.962 --> 01:15:55.231
Come with me.

01:18:04.325 --> 01:18:06.995
You are under arrest,
Mrs. Gould.

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:21.100
- Harold.
- Come.

01:19:21.102 --> 01:19:22.467
Harold. Harold.

01:19:22.469 --> 01:19:24.906
Take care, my love.

01:20:03.011 --> 01:20:04.480
I'm so sorry.

01:20:06.748 --> 01:20:09.018
I'm so sorry.

01:20:52.593 --> 01:20:55.595
Do you think
that's the start?

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:08.377
Sounds like thousands of them.

01:21:19.154 --> 01:21:21.554
They'll be here any day.

01:21:23.424 --> 01:21:25.824
We're going to be all right!

01:22:09.570 --> 01:22:11.272
Take a seat.

01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:29.190
Didn't your guest teach you
any Russian?

01:22:31.692 --> 01:22:33.262
Who knew about him?

01:22:34.428 --> 01:22:35.696
No one knew.

01:22:37.331 --> 01:22:39.067
And the radio?

01:22:40.134 --> 01:22:41.669
It was hidden.

01:22:47.875 --> 01:22:50.275
Mrs. Gould,

01:22:50.277 --> 01:22:53.815
we know people visited you
regularly to listen to the BBC.

01:22:54.781 --> 01:22:56.716
Your brother.

01:22:56.718 --> 01:22:58.917
Your friend Miss Fournier,
the owner of the property.

01:22:58.919 --> 01:23:00.418
No, no.

01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:02.220
Elena never came
into the house.

01:23:02.222 --> 01:23:03.624
She knows nothing.

01:23:20.741 --> 01:23:23.411
Don't let me keep you
from your packing.

01:23:40.661 --> 01:23:41.797
Gould.

01:23:44.231 --> 01:23:45.600
Unusual name.

01:23:47.302 --> 01:23:49.304
Jewish?

01:23:55.576 --> 01:23:58.614
Are you a Jew, Mrs. Gould?

01:24:08.423 --> 01:24:10.392
Mind your own
bloody business.

01:24:38.986 --> 01:24:39.954
Arthur.

01:24:43.624 --> 01:24:45.390
- How are they treating you?
- All right.

01:24:45.392 --> 01:24:46.826
Is there any news?

01:24:46.828 --> 01:24:48.594
Your court case
is set for tomorrow.

01:24:48.596 --> 01:24:50.028
They're trying to get
representation,

01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:51.529
but they won't allow it.

01:24:51.531 --> 01:24:53.765
Have you heard anything?
About the Allies?

01:24:53.767 --> 01:24:56.368
People are saying the priority
is to take back France.

01:24:56.370 --> 01:24:57.702
What do you mean?

01:24:57.704 --> 01:24:58.871
I'm sorry, Lou.
They're not coming.

01:24:58.873 --> 01:25:00.241
Of course they're coming.

01:25:01.609 --> 01:25:03.312
Of course they're coming.

01:25:22.062 --> 01:25:23.895
Fournier, Nicole...

01:25:29.337 --> 01:25:31.436
Fournier, Nicole!

01:25:34.441 --> 01:25:35.440
Fournier, Nicole:

01:25:35.442 --> 01:25:37.512
4 months and 15 days.

01:25:40.847 --> 01:25:44.050
Le Druillenec, Harold Osmond.

01:25:44.052 --> 01:25:45.818
Le Druillenec, Harold Osmond.

01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:46.955
Five months.

01:25:48.322 --> 01:25:50.523
Gould, Louisa Mary.

01:25:53.361 --> 01:25:55.427
Gould, Louisa Mary,

01:25:55.429 --> 01:25:57.028
née Le Druillenec.

01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:58.530
Two years.

01:26:00.968 --> 01:26:03.672
These sentences
to be served in Germany.

01:26:09.076 --> 01:26:10.579
Oh, my God.

01:26:58.526 --> 01:27:00.028
Okay, quickly.

01:27:02.062 --> 01:27:03.964
Yes, yes. Quick.

01:27:13.173 --> 01:27:14.109
Yes.

01:27:39.534 --> 01:27:41.567
From your friends.

01:27:41.569 --> 01:27:43.469
I can't see them?

01:27:43.471 --> 01:27:44.502
I'm sorry.

01:27:44.504 --> 01:27:46.007
Has she gone?

01:27:47.475 --> 01:27:48.810
Last night.

01:27:50.511 --> 01:27:52.043
She will be all right?

01:27:52.045 --> 01:27:55.079
You know Lou.
She's a tough old bird.

01:27:55.081 --> 01:27:58.016
Gave as good as she got
with them.

01:27:58.018 --> 01:27:59.752
They will find a way.
I know.

01:27:59.754 --> 01:28:01.854
They will break her.
They will break her.

01:28:01.856 --> 01:28:04.756
She will be all right, Bill.

01:28:04.758 --> 01:28:07.094
No, they will break her.

01:28:08.529 --> 01:28:10.165
They will break her, Mattie!

01:29:15.663 --> 01:29:16.831
Water!

01:29:27.909 --> 01:29:29.210
Harold.

01:29:33.013 --> 01:29:34.615
Lou?

01:29:39.553 --> 01:29:42.257
Did they say
where they're taking you?

01:29:49.262 --> 01:29:50.865
It's my birthday.

01:30:00.607 --> 01:30:01.842
My birthday, Lou.

01:30:04.277 --> 01:30:06.280
Wait. Wait.

01:30:13.654 --> 01:30:14.955
It's tobacco.

01:30:19.259 --> 01:30:21.295
Happy birthday, my love.

01:30:23.263 --> 01:30:26.698
Next year I'll give you
Sherbet Dabs.

01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.667
Lemon ones.

01:30:37.210 --> 01:30:39.580
Lou. Lou!

01:30:57.097 --> 01:30:58.232
Lou.

01:31:44.779 --> 01:31:46.811
Device located. Mark it.

01:31:46.813 --> 01:31:49.150
Watson, move forward ten yards.

01:31:50.685 --> 01:31:52.721
Stephenson,
sweep that right flank.

01:31:54.855 --> 01:31:57.855
Device located.

01:31:57.857 --> 01:32:00.292
Move forward another ten yards.

01:32:00.294 --> 01:32:01.960
Ivy!

01:32:01.962 --> 01:32:03.761
Got one here.

01:32:03.763 --> 01:32:05.797
Ivy. Ivy.

01:32:07.334 --> 01:32:10.234
What? What is it?
What's the matter?

01:32:10.236 --> 01:32:12.136
Harold's alive.

01:32:12.138 --> 01:32:13.471
They found him.

01:32:13.473 --> 01:32:15.174
Oh, thank God!

01:32:15.176 --> 01:32:17.309
He'll be arriving
at the sanatorium in St. Heliers

01:32:17.311 --> 01:32:18.844
on Friday.

01:32:18.846 --> 01:32:21.246
Where did they find him?

01:32:21.248 --> 01:32:23.652
In a place called
Bergen-Belsen.

01:32:33.259 --> 01:32:34.859
Oh, thank you.

01:32:34.861 --> 01:32:36.230
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:32:39.734 --> 01:32:41.002
We're closed.

01:32:43.103 --> 01:32:45.336
Oh, please, Mrs. Le Feuvre.

01:32:45.338 --> 01:32:46.807
You heard me.

01:33:01.288 --> 01:33:02.824
Halt!

01:33:34.254 --> 01:33:36.958
Burryi, Feodor Polycarpovich.

01:34:09.155 --> 01:34:10.889
Go in.

01:34:20.334 --> 01:34:21.770
Harold.

01:34:23.603 --> 01:34:25.069
Harold?

01:34:25.071 --> 01:34:28.042
It's me. It's Ivy.

01:34:31.611 --> 01:34:34.081
You're safe now, my love.

01:34:37.951 --> 01:34:40.053
And we're going
to get you well.

01:34:55.002 --> 01:34:59.039
Harold, do you know
where Lou is?

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:24.898
Here. Here. Elsie.
Elsie, yes, I'm here.

01:35:26.933 --> 01:35:29.536
- It's good to see you.
- Jack! Jack!

01:35:36.176 --> 01:35:38.847
Nicole. Oh, my God!

01:35:40.914 --> 01:35:42.082
Oh, God.

01:35:44.285 --> 01:35:46.554
Where's Lou? Where's Lou?
