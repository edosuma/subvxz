00:51.201 --> 00:52.367
Oh, I didn't know you did that.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.778
Yes. This was back
in New York in the '70s.

00:54.797 --> 00:59.283

How did you even find me?

02:02.531 --> 02:04.939
Your Aunt Joyce
posted about your show.

02:05.033 --> 02:06.458
It was "QAnon, QAnon,

"my nephew Max

Guys,

02:17.120 --> 02:19.096
I can see you
through the window.

02:20.307 --> 02:23.200
Look, Max, I'm not the guy
I used to be.

02:23.218 --> 02:25.202
-(sighs)
-I quit drinking.

02:25.295 --> 02:26.645
Again?

02:27.464 --> 02:30.390
Oh! Oh, look who's here.
I didn't know you were out here.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.708
I just, uh...

02:31.801 --> 02:35.654
I was at the more shops
and additional parking.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.214
Hi, I'm... I'm Kat.

02:37.307 --> 02:38.565
I'm Max's girlfriend.

02:38.642 --> 02:41.994
Hi, I'm Max's father, Dan,
and, uh, I'm...

02:42.163 --> 02:44.121
Leaving. He's leaving.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.390
Right.

02:47.168 --> 02:51.128
Look, here's my number
if you want to have dinner.

02:53.248 --> 02:54.656
Damn, these guys age well.

02:54.750 --> 02:57.918
Makes me wish I had started
wearing sunscreen years ago.

02:59.329 --> 03:01.847
You know, I'm his girlfriend,
so I'm just gonna take that.

03:01.998 --> 03:03.140
(chuckles)

03:05.911 --> 03:08.103
well, I hope to hear
from you, Max.

03:10.432 --> 03:12.082
Are you okay?

03:12.100 --> 03:13.433
Yeah, fine.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.860
Are you gonna
have dinner with him?

03:15.087 --> 03:15.861
Why would I?

03:16.088 --> 03:17.437
Aren't you curious?

03:17.589 --> 03:18.680
I-I can't deal with this
right now.

03:18.774 --> 03:20.607
I have a set to finish...
Guys,

03:20.759 --> 03:22.534
I can still see you.

03:24.763 --> 03:27.021
Tell me, what kind of vibe

03:27.115 --> 03:28.356
do you want for your kitchen?

03:28.375 --> 03:31.117
We want it to feel
very inviting.

03:31.270 --> 03:34.287
Like, like where Martha Stewart
could roll croissants

03:34.364 --> 03:36.381
and Snoop Dogg can roll a blunt.

03:36.533 --> 03:39.218
Yeah, and the countertops
need to be able to hold

03:39.369 --> 03:42.036
both of our body weights.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.639
No reason.

03:45.617 --> 03:47.133
Here you go, Sheila.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.618
Oh, you're looking clean, man.

03:48.637 --> 03:51.063
You got the second-best
haircut in the room.

03:51.214 --> 03:52.380
(chuckles) Thank you.

03:52.474 --> 03:54.066
Yeah, Max sent him
to his stylist.

03:54.217 --> 03:57.143
Oh, she washed my hair,
gave me a shoulder massage,

03:57.238 --> 03:58.737
then she used a blow-dryer,

03:58.964 --> 04:00.555
so I guess I got
my first blow...

04:00.632 --> 04:02.799
No, that's different,
that's different.

04:02.818 --> 04:03.967
Oh.

04:04.060 --> 04:06.653
This is beautiful.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.896
Have you thought
of a feature wall,

04:09.065 --> 04:10.807
maybe with reclaimed wood?

04:10.900 --> 04:14.494
I once built a whole barn
out of another barn.

04:14.646 --> 04:16.237
The circle of barns.

04:16.257 --> 04:19.332
That's actually
a very good idea.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.409
You know, I would be happy
to give you a hand

04:21.503 --> 04:22.261
with construction.

04:22.412 --> 04:24.429
I've built more than just barns.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.824
Hay lofts, horse paddocks,
a Dairy Queen.

04:27.843 --> 04:28.842
Really?

04:28.994 --> 04:30.918
Yeah.
The only thing I can't build is

04:30.938 --> 04:32.829
a family of my own.

04:32.848 --> 04:35.065
(sighs)

04:37.927 --> 04:39.278
Morning.

04:39.505 --> 04:41.929
Oh, hey there.
Did you get my email?

04:42.024 --> 04:43.690
I did.

04:43.767 --> 04:46.100
I've never gotten an Evite
to take a sexy shower before.

04:46.194 --> 04:48.102
I RSVP'd yes and commented

04:48.196 --> 04:50.514
"I would loofah to join you."

04:50.532 --> 04:53.350
I don't know if your party
is private or not,

04:53.352 --> 04:54.626
but if you want to invite me,

04:54.853 --> 04:56.461
I do now have an email.

04:56.613 --> 04:59.965
It's Gideon, Hezekiah,
Zechariah, Jebediah, Jedidiah,

05:00.150 --> 05:01.858
one, two, two, five--
that's Christmas--

05:01.951 --> 05:03.927
@aol.com.

05:04.863 --> 05:06.212
So, the same as your Instagram.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.365
Max, have you given
any more thought

05:08.383 --> 05:09.716
to having dinner with your dad?

05:09.868 --> 05:12.293
I've been thinking more about
this sexy shower...

05:12.462 --> 05:15.430
that I'm now realizing
is in three weeks.

05:15.541 --> 05:18.708
There's nothing sexier
than planning ahead.

05:18.727 --> 05:19.801
(scoffs)

05:19.820 --> 05:21.227
As far as my dad-- you're right,

05:21.322 --> 05:23.063
I should probably
hear what he has to say.

05:23.231 --> 05:24.489
But you're coming with me.

05:24.716 --> 05:25.640
I'm not sitting there
alone with him.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.217
Great.
I will set it up.

05:27.235 --> 05:28.735
Mm, more planning.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.145
I'm gonna add it
to our shared calendar.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.314
-(phone vibrates)
-Oh.

05:34.150 --> 05:37.410
Roy and Amanda just RSVP'ed
yes to the sexy shower.

05:37.563 --> 05:39.563
Roy and Amanda?

05:39.581 --> 05:41.247
Oh, no.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.324
I sent this Evite
to my book club?

05:43.344 --> 05:44.760
(groans)

05:46.496 --> 05:49.514
So after my father passed,
I thought to myself,

05:49.666 --> 05:51.925
"Is teaching mathematics
really my life's purpose?"

05:52.001 --> 05:55.169
No, so I opened a café
where you can get coffee

05:55.189 --> 05:57.097
and muffins
and snuggle with cats.

05:57.249 --> 05:58.582
I know you know all this,

05:58.600 --> 06:01.084
but I can't assume
he watches the show.

06:01.177 --> 06:02.844
So, how long have you and Max
been together?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.011
About four months.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.406
But we've been best friends
since college.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.441
We still think he's coming?

06:08.594 --> 06:10.427
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

06:10.445 --> 06:11.945
He's just...
he's just running late.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.780
You know, he-he booked
studio time,

06:13.949 --> 06:16.691
he's recording a demo,
trying to get signed by a label.

06:16.785 --> 06:18.377
He's actually really good.

06:18.528 --> 06:20.545
He's like Elton John
in Tom Brady's body. (chuckles)

06:20.697 --> 06:23.548
-Well, definitely better than
the other way around.
-(laughs)

06:23.775 --> 06:27.034
I've never been to
an Ethiopian restaurant before.

06:27.112 --> 06:28.294
And I'm loving this.

06:28.463 --> 06:30.447
Microwaves should come with
a preset button--

06:30.465 --> 06:32.891
popcorn, baked potato,
hot towel.

06:33.042 --> 06:33.892
(sniffs)

06:34.119 --> 06:35.619
You're gonna love the food.

06:35.637 --> 06:38.471
I got a taste for it
when I was working in Africa.

06:38.624 --> 06:40.882
Africa, wow.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.067
Do you miss "the rains"?

06:42.294 --> 06:43.902
(chuckles)
Toto?

06:44.129 --> 06:46.129
No? No Toto?

06:46.148 --> 06:47.964
So, Dan, what do you do
for living?

06:47.983 --> 06:50.057
Well, you know those
big oil pipelines

06:50.226 --> 06:51.076
everyone likes to protest?

06:51.227 --> 06:53.319
Get out.
You're an eco-warrior?

06:53.396 --> 06:55.138
Close.
I laid the pipes.

06:55.157 --> 06:57.416
-Oh.
-Anyway, now I volunteer
for a charity

06:57.643 --> 06:59.993
that brings fresh water
to rural villages.

07:00.145 --> 07:01.753
Oh, that's so inspiring.

07:01.905 --> 07:04.314
You're like Gandhi
in Tom Brady's body.

07:04.332 --> 07:06.983
No, please,
that guy is so overrated.

07:07.002 --> 07:08.576
-Gandhi, not Tom Brady.
-(chuckles)

07:08.595 --> 07:10.837
Yeah, I mean,
Gandhi beat the British empire,

07:10.931 --> 07:13.006
but Tom Brady beat
the 2017 Falcons

07:13.100 --> 07:14.582
after being down 28-3

07:14.676 --> 07:16.918
with two minutes left
in the third, so... GOAT.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.011
(laughs)

07:18.163 --> 07:20.180
(phone vibrates)

07:20.332 --> 07:21.440
Oh, no.

07:21.591 --> 07:22.832
Everything okay?

07:22.851 --> 07:26.260
Yeah, it's just
Max's session is running long.

07:26.354 --> 07:27.687
He's not gonna
be able to make dinner.

07:27.839 --> 07:29.689
Well, I can't say I blame him.

07:29.841 --> 07:31.616
Anyway, it was nice
meeting you,

07:31.843 --> 07:34.453
and I'm just glad Max found
someone who makes him happy.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.770
Wait, hang on.

07:35.939 --> 07:38.348
We're both here.
We're both hungry.

07:38.366 --> 07:39.683
Why don't we just have dinner?

07:39.701 --> 07:41.017
Really?
You sure?

07:41.110 --> 07:44.463
Yeah, we can talk more football
like, uh, Tom Brady.

07:44.614 --> 07:45.855
Too pretty?

07:45.874 --> 07:47.299
Okay. And yes.

07:47.450 --> 07:48.541
(laughs)

07:48.694 --> 07:50.969
All right.
What should I have to drink?

07:51.162 --> 07:54.547
They got a keribo, a cheka.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.123
A "spree-tay"?

07:56.143 --> 07:59.519
-Uh, that's just Sprite.
-Oh.

08:06.803 --> 08:09.212
This is so good.
Max would love this.

08:09.305 --> 08:10.471
Really?

08:10.565 --> 08:13.307
The Max I remember
wasn't an adventurous eater.

08:13.385 --> 08:15.309
He would only eat foods
he could draw.

08:15.403 --> 08:18.830
Well, he has certainly
broadened his horizons.

08:18.982 --> 08:20.665
He's traveled
all over the world.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.335
He can order chicken nuggets
in 12 different languages.

08:23.486 --> 08:25.337
There was a time
I could order whiskey neat

08:25.488 --> 08:26.838
-in 12 different languages.
-(chuckles)

08:26.990 --> 08:29.916
Really, you just say,
"whiskey neat."

08:30.068 --> 08:32.085
Yeah, Max told me
you stopped drinking.

08:32.237 --> 08:33.178
That's great.

08:33.997 --> 08:37.407
I've got a little over a year.
It's the longest I've ever gone.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.592
I promised myself I wouldn't
reach out to Max again

08:39.745 --> 08:41.077
until it stuck.

08:41.170 --> 08:43.580
I didn't know
you reached out to him before.

08:43.598 --> 08:45.690
Only 30, 40 times.

08:45.917 --> 08:49.194
To be fair, a lot of those
were just me drunkenly singing

08:49.421 --> 08:51.421
"Cat's in the Cradle"
on his voice mail.

08:51.439 --> 08:53.940
So that's why
he hates that song.

08:54.092 --> 08:55.700
Did you ever sing him
"Come On Eileen?"

08:55.927 --> 08:58.611
Oh, I had my moments,
but I was never that drunk.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.430
(laughs)

09:08.290 --> 09:09.789
We are gonna document

the amazing transformation
of our home.

09:12.277 --> 09:13.610
We're gonna turn

into a condo-maximum.

09:14.796 --> 09:15.945

-That's right.

09:15.964 --> 09:17.797

any sponsors out there

who want to give us free stuff,
we're open to anything.

09:19.301 --> 09:20.617

09:20.710 --> 09:23.970
Like, over here could be
the Circuit City doorway.

09:24.122 --> 09:28.215
Or around the corner we can have
the Souplantation laundry nook.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.569
(chuckles) Yeah.
Laundry and farting nook.

Well, I know y'all want
to open up this kitchen,

10:20.103 --> 10:22.770
so we need to take down
this entire wall.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.106
We just need to make sure
that there's no duct work,

10:25.125 --> 10:26.941

10:26.960 --> 10:28.534
So how do we check for all that?

10:28.687 --> 10:31.855
Well, my cousin Ernie would put
one foot in a bucket of water

10:31.948 --> 10:33.206

inside the wall

find anything.

18:55.451 --> 18:57.193
Look, um...

18:57.211 --> 18:59.378
I know you're really trying,

18:59.455 --> 19:00.529
but I think...

19:00.548 --> 19:02.640
I think that has to be
Max's decision.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.143
Yeah.

19:05.370 --> 19:07.562
No, I-I get it, uh...

19:09.056 --> 19:10.539
Well, it, uh, you know,

19:10.633 --> 19:13.893
uh, maybe we'll see
each other again someday.

19:13.969 --> 19:16.529
-You, I hope I never see again.
-(chuckles)

19:17.398 --> 19:20.032
Hey, Kat, have you seen my...

19:21.736 --> 19:22.827
Dad.

19:24.038 --> 19:27.481
Uh, she didn't know
I was coming and, uh,

19:27.500 --> 19:30.960
you know, I-I didn't know
that you were here.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.465
Take care.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.417
Hang on.

19:38.569 --> 19:40.052
Yeah?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.181
I-I... Hold on a sec.

19:43.332 --> 19:45.474
I just...
I can't, with that.

19:48.504 --> 19:50.746
Kat says she thinks
you've changed.

19:51.599 --> 19:54.600
And maybe you are
a different guy now, but...

19:54.752 --> 19:56.527
I don't care.

19:58.013 --> 19:59.864
I was ten years old

20:00.091 --> 20:01.699
when you walked out.

20:01.776 --> 20:03.075
Ten!

20:04.095 --> 20:05.828
Who the hell does that?

20:07.265 --> 20:09.782
And now you want to come back
and, what, play catch?

20:09.876 --> 20:11.542
No thanks.

20:13.104 --> 20:16.105
You taught me
one thing in life, Dad.

20:16.123 --> 20:18.257
How to get along without you.

20:19.777 --> 20:22.294
So I really do hope that
you've turned your life around,

20:22.447 --> 20:25.139
but I don't
need to be a part of it.

20:30.621 --> 20:32.563
Fair enough.

20:39.464 --> 20:40.629
(exhales)

20:40.648 --> 20:43.890
I know you think
I probably blew my one sh...

20:43.910 --> 20:46.160
(sobbing)

20:47.989 --> 20:50.498
Sorry, I...
I just... I can't...
