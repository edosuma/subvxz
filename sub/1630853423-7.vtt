09:50.549 --> 09:52.551
Why do I have to wait over here?

09:53.302 --> 09:55.137
Someone needs to watch the van.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.639
We should just call Nick.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.683
If here were here,
we wouldn't have this problem.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.852
No, we'd have a worse one.

10:05.564 --> 10:08.358
He doesn't look very dangerous.

10:08.442 --> 10:09.568
Actually, he seems nice.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.445
Looks can be deceiving.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.572
But how do you know he's bad?

10:13.655 --> 10:14.573
Because they told me.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.951
And you just believe them?

10:19.494 --> 10:21.038
I do.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.998
Do you know what that is?

10:23.081 --> 10:25.000
It's called faith.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.460
Without it, what's the point of anything?

10:38.180 --> 10:40.349
The fucking parking in this country...

10:53.779 --> 10:55.155
Look at me. Start talking.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.406
What?

10:56.490 --> 10:59.618
Just do it! Say anything!
He doesn't understand!

11:00.327 --> 11:01.828
The food in Ohio was disgusting.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.538
That's good!

11:03.914 --> 11:05.791
This is why you scare me!

11:05.874 --> 11:07.334
This is the girl that snuck a boy over!

11:07.417 --> 11:08.710
Look at the cop, he's going crazy.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.963
You're unbelievable...

11:12.881 --> 11:14.257
I'm sick and tired of your lies!

11:14.341 --> 11:15.967
You brought me here through a portal...

11:28.855 --> 11:29.773
Thank you.

11:30.899 --> 11:31.983
You're welcome.

11:33.610 --> 11:34.903
How crazy was that?

29:33.272 --> 29:35.274
So you're not coming?

29:35.941 --> 29:38.110
To drive around all day putting up fliers?

29:38.194 --> 29:39.862
No, thanks. I'd rather stay here.

29:39.945 --> 29:42.781
Besides, here there's room service,
a pool. Everything.

29:42.865 --> 29:45.534
You mean you're just going to hang out
on your phone.

29:45.618 --> 29:47.745
I'm looking at the stuff people post
in this town.

29:48.829 --> 29:51.248
They really love the high school
baseball team.

29:54.210 --> 29:55.794
No way. It's him.

30:03.177 --> 30:04.887
Look.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.139
It's the apostate. Right?

30:08.349 --> 30:09.475
Where is this from?

30:09.558 --> 30:13.354
Some bar. J... Spratts?

30:13.437 --> 30:14.438
Let's go?

30:14.522 --> 30:16.607
No. You're staying. I'm going by myself.

30:16.690 --> 30:19.693
I don't get it.
I thought you wanted me to come?

30:19.777 --> 30:21.445
How am I supposed to learn
if you make me stay?

30:21.529 --> 30:24.949
We're very close now. It's dangerous.

30:26.242 --> 30:27.618
I wanna come with you.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.787
You wanna be a part of this?

30:29.870 --> 30:30.871
Yes.

30:30.955 --> 30:32.915
You want to play a role?

30:32.998 --> 30:36.210
Okay! That means following my orders.

49:24.796 --> 49:26.214
Mom... stop him!

50:43.124 --> 50:45.126
It's gonna be okay.

50:47.795 --> 50:49.464
I promise.
