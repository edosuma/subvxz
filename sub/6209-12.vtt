HILDA:
I love this time of year.

00:03.253 --> 00:06.869
Christmas carols, sleigh rides,
gigantic electric bills.

00:07.046 --> 00:08.588
Sabrina, want to give us a hand?

00:08.755 --> 00:10.794
In a sec. I'm revising
my Christmas wish list.

00:10.963 --> 00:13.751
This year I'm hoping
for a computer, a mountain bike...

00:13.924 --> 00:15.915
Oh, and this great ski jacket
I saw at the mall.

00:16.090 --> 00:18.711
SALEM: You're not exactly
the Little Match Girl, are you?

00:18.883 --> 00:21.005
Those sound
pretty expensive, Sabrina.

00:21.176 --> 00:23.879
I know. That's why I prepared
a list of backup gift ideas

00:24.051 --> 00:28.047
in a variety of price ranges.
Gotta go.

00:28.219 --> 00:29.677
Oh, and you'll note on the bottom,

00:29.844 --> 00:31.469
I've listed the times
I won't be around,

00:31.637 --> 00:33.261
so you can wrap my presents.

00:33.428 --> 00:37.092
Don't worry. I went through
that "give me" phase. It'll pass.

00:37.263 --> 00:39.136
ZELDA:
You're right.

00:39.597 --> 00:41.637
Hey. Give me that wise man.

00:41.807 --> 00:44.474
Well, guess we're almost
finished decorating,

00:44.640 --> 00:46.597
except for the tree.

00:49.058 --> 00:51.549
You know, it's lovely.

00:51.726 --> 00:54.595
But Christmas is a mortal holiday.

00:54.769 --> 00:57.010
Shouldn't we do the tree
the mortal way?

00:57.186 --> 00:59.723
- Okay. I'll conjure up a plastic one.
- Oh, no.

00:59.894 --> 01:02.266
I meant, shouldn't we go
and buy a tree

01:02.437 --> 01:04.061
and decorate it by hand?

01:04.230 --> 01:05.771
All right.

01:09.563 --> 01:13.477
- Where do they sell trees?
- The forest?

Advertise your product or brand here

01:31.070 --> 01:33.359
Too much rouge?

01:39.405 --> 01:40.734
So I can't decide whether I shoot

01:40.906 --> 01:43.230
for A, the computer
and the mountain bike,

01:43.407 --> 01:45.150
B, the computer
and the ski jacket,

01:45.325 --> 01:46.984
or C, all of the above.

01:47.158 --> 01:48.985
I'd hate to be there
if you got a savings bond.

01:49.159 --> 01:50.700
Hey, you wanna go
to the mall with me

01:50.868 --> 01:53.026
and do some important
Christmas present research?

01:53.202 --> 01:54.481
Can't. Gotta work.

01:54.661 --> 01:56.783
Got a job at Hilmann's
as a Santa Claus.

01:56.953 --> 01:59.110
Is that just
for the holiday season?

01:59.286 --> 02:01.990
It's an okay job. What bothers me
is when the little kids go home

02:02.163 --> 02:04.321
thinking they're gonna get
everything they asked for.

02:04.497 --> 02:06.240
A lot of them are
gonna be disappointed.

02:06.414 --> 02:08.371
Aw. Poor kids.

02:09.038 --> 02:11.161
So should I ask for a helmet
with the mountain bike,

02:11.331 --> 02:13.075
or do you think
that's just implied?

02:13.249 --> 02:15.040
The Army was defeated
at Brandywine...

02:15.208 --> 02:18.492
SABRINA: <i>Should I get
the mountain bike or the jacket?</i>

02:18.667 --> 02:20.410
<i>Definitely the mountain bike.</i>

02:20.584 --> 02:24.283
George Washington relocated
to Valley Forge.

02:24.460 --> 02:26.868
SABRINA: <i>Mountain bike,
George Washington...</i>

02:29.878 --> 02:32.500
- Sabrina. Sabrina?
GLASS: Sabrina.

02:32.672 --> 02:35.243
We're talking about
a very bloody war.

02:35.422 --> 02:36.454
Why are you smiling?

02:36.631 --> 02:41.421
Because I've been desensitized
by popular culture?

02:42.924 --> 02:44.549
SALEM:
Oh, I see.

02:44.716 --> 02:47.551
First you kill the tree,
and then you humiliate it.

02:47.718 --> 02:50.883
Doing mortal things the mortal way
just feels right.

02:51.052 --> 02:52.795
My thumbs are numb.

02:52.969 --> 02:55.636
You know, I was thinking,
when we finish with the tree,

02:55.803 --> 02:57.795
that we could roast
some chestnuts the mortal way.

02:57.970 --> 03:01.752
Oh, good grief. What's next?
Driving to the store?

03:01.929 --> 03:04.764
- Hey, what did you get?
- Let's see, meat glop,

03:04.930 --> 03:08.512
fruit glop, vegetable glop
and glop glop.

03:08.682 --> 03:12.179
- Yum. Save me a seat?
- Always.

03:13.641 --> 03:15.433
Now, what sounds edible?

03:16.058 --> 03:17.683
A baked potato.

03:21.893 --> 03:24.383
[IN RUSSIAN]

03:24.936 --> 03:26.431
Excellent.

03:26.603 --> 03:28.679
Where did you get that?

03:28.855 --> 03:31.344
Um, I ordered the kosher meal.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.642
- Want a bite?
- No, thanks. It smells like vodka.

03:36.897 --> 03:38.061
[ZELDA GROANS]

03:38.232 --> 03:42.228
For the last time, when I push,
you pull. Got it?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.855
- Could you be less technical?
ZELDA: Oh!

03:45.026 --> 03:46.354
SALEM:
Keep trimming that tree,

03:46.525 --> 03:49.016
and you'll be able to use it
in your car as an air freshener.

03:51.736 --> 03:53.774
- Hi, Harvey.
- Hey, Libby.

03:53.944 --> 03:56.316
- Got any plans for the holidays?
- Like it matters.

03:56.487 --> 03:57.767
I hate Christmas.

03:57.945 --> 03:59.772
What's your take on Kwanza?

03:59.946 --> 04:01.737
Usually like all the presents,
but this year

04:01.905 --> 04:04.740
I have to be around
my bratty stepbrother, Russell.

04:04.906 --> 04:07.112
Really? Your family has
a brat in it?

04:07.282 --> 04:10.151
He colours with my lipsticks,
drips chocolate on my stuff,

04:10.325 --> 04:12.731
and he can cry on cue.

04:12.908 --> 04:14.948
What's your problem, freak?

04:15.118 --> 04:18.236
Hoping Santa will give you
a personality this year?

04:19.785 --> 04:21.743
And a crossbow!

04:21.910 --> 04:24.484
Push, push. Push! Push!

04:24.662 --> 04:27.697
I knew those Lamaze classes
would pay off.

04:28.955 --> 04:30.947
ZELDA: There.
- We have the makings

04:31.122 --> 04:34.157
- of a beautiful fire hazard.
- What do you think?

04:34.332 --> 04:35.826
That's what a mortal tree
looks like?

04:36.373 --> 04:38.496
No wonder they drink
during the holidays.

04:40.042 --> 04:42.164
I'm gonna conjure some
more asparagus. Want some?

04:42.334 --> 04:44.372
No, thanks. You put
too much ketchup on yours.

04:47.501 --> 04:49.494
Hey, somebody took a bite
out of it.

04:49.669 --> 04:53.083
I did. You didn't conjure
your own asparagus, you took mine.

04:53.253 --> 04:55.494
You think there's something wrong
with my magic?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.046
Conjure something else,
we'll see.

04:57.212 --> 04:59.667
I could use some protein.
How about a wharf rat?

04:59.838 --> 05:01.914
How about a blouse?

05:04.090 --> 05:06.757
There. I'm fine.
And I have good taste.

05:07.883 --> 05:09.162
Zelda, how was the lecture?

05:09.342 --> 05:10.540
For a six-part dissertation

05:10.716 --> 05:12.709
on the reproductive cycle
of garden snails,

05:12.884 --> 05:14.627
it was awfully dry.

05:16.135 --> 05:18.921
And, boy, it is really
getting cold outside.

05:19.094 --> 05:21.715
Here's a tip, try wearing clothes.

05:21.886 --> 05:26.012
Hey! What happened to my
blouse? It was my favourite--

05:26.180 --> 05:27.342
--Green silk one?

05:27.512 --> 05:30.134
Sabrina, how many times
do I have to tell you to ask

05:30.306 --> 05:31.503
before you borrow my clothes?

05:31.681 --> 05:33.590
Especially when
I'm already wearing them.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.259
Something's wrong with me,
Aunt Zelda.

05:35.433 --> 05:38.929
I conjured asparagus, I got Aunt Hilda's.
I tried to conjure a blouse, I got yours.

05:39.099 --> 05:43.262
Whatever you do,
don't conjure anything fur.

05:43.435 --> 05:44.715
HILDA:
What do you think it is, Zeldy?

05:44.894 --> 05:48.177
Well, from what I know,
the problem may be psychological.

05:49.895 --> 05:51.685
Now, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

05:51.853 --> 05:53.597
Dr. Bull is one of the most
highly regarded

05:53.771 --> 05:55.146

05:55.313 --> 05:57.470
She's got two doctorates
from Other Realm universities

05:57.647 --> 05:59.189
and one from Utah State.

05:59.356 --> 06:02.972
And tell me again why I had to sign
that lobotomy release form?

06:04.440 --> 06:07.060
And that about wraps it up.
Can I go now?

06:07.233 --> 06:09.521
Conjures things
from others, narcissism.

06:09.692 --> 06:12.608
Based on these symptoms,
one would conclude

06:12.776 --> 06:15.018
that you're suffering
from egotitis.

06:15.194 --> 06:17.980
Me? I'm not the one
with the wall full of diplomas.

06:18.986 --> 06:21.109
Attacks when provoked.

06:21.820 --> 06:23.480
It's a textbook case.

06:23.654 --> 06:25.445
You're behaving like a little girl.

06:25.613 --> 06:27.440
Am not!

06:27.613 --> 06:31.396
What say we have a chat
with your inner child?

06:33.281 --> 06:34.989
Hey, I recognise you.

06:35.157 --> 06:37.565
You're always encouraging me
to run with scissors.

06:37.784 --> 06:39.611
Tell me, inner child,

06:39.784 --> 06:41.907
what do you like most
about Christmas?

06:42.076 --> 06:44.318
All the presents.

06:44.493 --> 06:47.577
Do you enjoy being with
other people at Christmas?

06:47.744 --> 06:49.737
If they bring me presents.

06:49.912 --> 06:53.113
Thank you. That will be all.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.446
INNER CHILD:
Where's my presents?

06:55.622 --> 06:58.705
Sorry. I didn't know my inner child
would be so childish.

06:58.873 --> 07:02.572
Or sticky.
I see what's happening here.

07:02.749 --> 07:04.030
You're trying to recapture

07:04.208 --> 07:06.698
the excitement of Christmas
you felt as a child.

07:06.875 --> 07:10.953
So you're acting like a child.
Or, medically speaking,

07:11.126 --> 07:12.786
a spoiled brat.

07:12.961 --> 07:16.244
So do I need a shot,
or can I get away with an inhaler?

07:16.419 --> 07:17.534
It's not that easy.

07:17.711 --> 07:20.830
The cure for this malady
must come from within.

07:21.004 --> 07:24.253
You've got to rediscover
the magic of Christmas.

07:24.422 --> 07:28.003
And when you do,
your egotitis will go away.

07:28.173 --> 07:30.165

- Except for this.

was here a minute ago.

from Johnny Mathis.

still hasn't gone away.

08:14.562 --> 08:18.011
Hey, maybe if I open
some presents, I'll feel better.

08:18.187 --> 08:21.104
Oh, no, I shook that one
last night. It was good.

08:21.272 --> 08:24.521
Sabrina, when you have egotitis,
you can't get any presents.

only makes it worse.

with the steeple and the bells?

08:39.900 --> 08:42.653

you guys can do.

being the size of a grapefruit.

would be on "yes."

11:09.570 --> 11:11.443
Voilà!

11:11.612 --> 11:14.896
You know, I've got to admit it.
I'm really proud of us.

11:15.072 --> 11:19.317
We did it all by ourselves,
just like a mortal family.

11:20.448 --> 11:22.026
Do you want to zap it,
or should I?

11:22.199 --> 11:23.397
I will.

11:26.075 --> 11:28.114
Little gaudy, don't you think?

11:28.283 --> 11:31.734
SABRINA:
Help! Hurt Bob in the kitchen!

11:33.243 --> 11:35.035
You take it easy.
We'll get you an ice pack.

11:35.203 --> 11:39.329
- Everything is going to be fine.
- Absolutely.

what you've done?

11:42.788 --> 11:46.405
- What, Bob's gonna sue?
- No. He's Santa Claus.

11:46.581 --> 11:47.695
- What?
HILDA: That's right.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.414
You've just maimed
Father Christmas.

11:49.581 --> 11:53.530
So I guess I'm not the only one
not getting presents this year.

11:54.832 --> 11:57.120
So if you're Santa,
how come you're not chubby?

11:57.292 --> 11:59.498
Oh, combination of
cardiovascular exercise

11:59.668 --> 12:02.371
and a little weight-training.
Could be that tapeworm.

12:02.543 --> 12:05.496
Anyway, I've got a lot
of deliveries to make. Ha-ha.

12:05.670 --> 12:08.041
Ho, ho, ho-- Ohh! Oh!

12:08.212 --> 12:09.623
You are not going anywhere.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.373
Isn't there someone
that could fill in?

12:11.545 --> 12:13.170
Like a temp service or a cousin?

12:13.338 --> 12:16.006
Well, there's always Mrs. Claus,
but I can't call her.

12:16.173 --> 12:19.789
She works for UPS. This time
of year, they're real crazy.

12:19.965 --> 12:21.127
Well, Hilda and I can't help.

12:21.298 --> 12:22.792
We have to stay
and take care of you.

12:22.965 --> 12:24.757
There must be somebody.

12:25.842 --> 12:29.174
Me? But Bob and I were this close
to curing my egotitis.

12:29.343 --> 12:31.134
A few more hours,
I'll be back to normal.

12:32.468 --> 12:35.551
Couldn't we just order everyone
something from a catalogue?

12:37.345 --> 12:38.804
SABRINA:
Okay, I've got it.

12:38.971 --> 12:40.714
Head due north
and look for reindeer.

12:40.888 --> 12:42.927
But don't take the first
"Santa's Workshop" exit.

12:43.097 --> 12:44.888
Take the second.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.425
Okay. This is a girl
who has trouble

12:47.597 --> 12:49.591
getting to school on time,
and she's supposed to

12:49.766 --> 12:52.221
deliver millions of presents
by tomorrow morning?

12:52.391 --> 12:54.716
Am I the only one
who sees a problem?

12:54.891 --> 12:59.102
You know, Salem,
that's an excellent point.

13:09.896 --> 13:12.433
SALEM: "That's an excellent point.
That's an excellent point."

the flaw in someone's logic.

Mayday! Mayday!
Intruder on the premises!

13:19.899 --> 13:21.939
- Who are you?
- Sabrina. Don't panic.

13:22.108 --> 13:24.065
Santa's had a little accident.

13:24.234 --> 13:27.648
No. It's okay.
I'm gonna fill in for him.

13:28.567 --> 13:30.192
No, I promise it'll be fine.

13:30.778 --> 13:32.734
Who are you?

13:32.903 --> 13:34.231
We're Santa's elves.

13:34.403 --> 13:36.111
Well, I thought
Santa's elves were small.

13:36.279 --> 13:37.689
You're probably thinking of Fritz.

13:37.862 --> 13:39.357
Whenever somebody
whips out a camera,

13:39.530 --> 13:41.356
guess who always happens
to be next to Santa.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.444
What are you building?

13:44.614 --> 13:46.856
- A CD player.
- Seriously?

13:47.490 --> 13:48.819
Man. You guys are good.

13:48.991 --> 13:51.446
Yeah, perhaps you didn't know this,
but we're on a deadline!

13:51.617 --> 13:54.402
- How about wrapping? All right.
- Gotcha.

13:54.576 --> 13:56.614
How about
a palm-sized digital camera?

13:56.784 --> 13:59.275
Not for me, but a friend
who's fallen on hard times.

13:59.452 --> 14:01.409
We'll call him Salem.

14:01.619 --> 14:04.952
- Ohh. Oh, boy.
- Is there anything else, Bob?

14:05.121 --> 14:07.077
I don't want to be
an imposition, please.

14:07.246 --> 14:08.906
Oh, Bob, you could
never be an imposition.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.159
Well, if you insist.

14:10.330 --> 14:11.493
How about a couple burgers,

14:11.664 --> 14:13.490
chocolate malted
and some chips?

14:13.664 --> 14:16.747
Hey, either of you gals up
for a game of Mouse Trap?

14:17.916 --> 14:18.994

What's that gonna be?

14:19.165 --> 14:21.703
A Ferrari, if someone would stop
breathing down my neck.

14:21.875 --> 14:24.282
I will if I can have a pipe cleaner.

14:24.459 --> 14:27.210
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

14:27.377 --> 14:30.081
- Fritz is wound a little tight.
- The naughty/nice list is missing.

14:30.252 --> 14:32.790
Okay. It's almost midnight,
the list is missing,

14:32.962 --> 14:34.622
I keep running into Fritz
under the mistletoe.

14:34.796 --> 14:36.669
Calm down. Okay, everyone
retrace your steps.

14:36.838 --> 14:38.546
That would put me under
the mistletoe.

14:38.714 --> 14:40.587
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

14:40.755 --> 14:42.499

to get on my nerves.

14:42.673 --> 14:46.420

The reindeer ate it.

- You're in charge.

to grease to get on that nice list?

14:53.009 --> 14:54.208
And nobody made a copy?

14:54.384 --> 14:56.708
Oh, there is a copy
of the list on that thing,

14:56.886 --> 14:58.628
but none of us know
how to use it.

14:58.803 --> 15:00.344
Oh, I bet I can.

15:00.511 --> 15:03.178
You know, it only takes a minute
to learn how to use these things.

15:03.345 --> 15:04.509
Santa won't let us touch it.

15:04.679 --> 15:07.299
Not since somebody got
addicted to solitaire.

15:08.514 --> 15:10.092
Hilda, wait!

15:10.264 --> 15:12.303
I've got a few more things
for you to pick up.

15:12.473 --> 15:15.140
Two gallons of ice cream,
four lemon meringue pies,

15:15.307 --> 15:18.177
a box of frozen onion rings
and a case of Birch Beer.

15:18.349 --> 15:20.756

Christmas in Tokyo.

the list they ate.

Think Zelda will let us borrow
the station waggon?

15:41.148 --> 15:43.270
There's no time.
These children need presents.

Okay. We've all had
our little laugh.

something on my head?

I'd like the black-cherry
nail polish!

I clipped his ear hair.

I clipped his ear hair.
How fast does that stuff grow?

Well, that does it
for the Baltic States.

- Want another pierogi?
- No, thanks.

baklava and pad thai.

It's a little jewellery box.

the right thing to do.
