WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.001
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.001 --> 00:04.705
CAN WE START OVER?

00:04.705 --> 00:06.237
IT WAS A SURPRISING DAY FOR
THE WOMEN OF WISTERIA LANE.

00:06.237 --> 00:09.380
(cell phone rings)
 WELL, I WAS WONDERING

00:09.380 --> 00:11.382
IF YOU MIGHT WANT
TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME.
 OKAY.

00:11.382 --> 00:15.416
HE'S GIVING HER ORGASMS?!
 AH! NOT DELIBERATELY.

00:15.416 --> 00:18.349
I CAN SEE WE'RE
GOING TO BE GREAT FRIENDS.

00:18.349 --> 00:21.021
YOU ARE A VIBRANT,
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN, YOU--

00:21.021 --> 00:24.655
WHO HASN'T HAD SEX IN TWO YEARS.
THAT SPELLS "GRANDMA" TO ME.

00:24.655 --> 00:28.159
LET ME COME STAY WITH YOU
WHEN I GET OUTTA HERE.

00:28.159 --> 00:29.700
THIS GUY THINKS
I'M OUT OF COMMISSION,

00:29.700 --> 00:32.162
AND I WANT TO KEEP IT
THAT WAY.
 WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

00:32.162 --> 00:34.265
YOU'VE BEEN ANTSY ALL NIGHT.
 I THINK I LEFT THE FREEZER DOOR
AT SCAVO'S OPEN.

00:34.265 --> 00:36.237
BUT IT WAS AN EVEN MORE
SURPRISING NIGHT...

00:36.237 --> 00:39.170
CRAP! IT'S MY DAD!
 FOR THE SCAVOS.

00:39.170 --> 00:42.513
WHERE IS SHE?
 DON'T. SHE ISN'T WEARING
ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

00:42.513 --> 00:45.045
WHO IS SHE?
 JUST SOME GIRL
FROM ENGLISH CLASS.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.178
I'M GONNA
GO IN THE BATHROOM.

00:47.178 --> 00:50.181
YOU GOT 60 SECONDS
TO GET HER OUT OF HERE.

01:04.834 --> 01:07.538
(Mary Alice) THERE WAS
A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING

01:07.538 --> 01:10.070
IN THE SCAVO HOUSE
THAT NIGHT.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.843
YOU SEE,
SOMEONE IN THE FAMILY

01:12.843 --> 01:16.177
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH A MARRIED WOMAN,

01:16.177 --> 01:19.750
AND LYNETTE SCAVO
SUSPECTED HER HUSBAND.

01:21.212 --> 01:23.114
HEY.
 (door closes)

01:23.114 --> 01:25.856
FALSE ALARM.
THE FREEZER WAS SHUT TIGHT.

01:25.856 --> 01:29.260
UNFORTUNATELY FOR LYNETTE,
SHE WAS WRONG.

01:29.260 --> 01:30.661
LIAR.

01:30.661 --> 01:33.294
WHAT?
 I ALWAYS KNEW THINGS COULD
CHANGE BETWEEN US, TOM,

01:33.294 --> 01:35.166
BUT NO MATTER WHAT,

01:35.166 --> 01:38.299
THE ONE THING I ALWAYS THOUGHT
I'D GET IS YOUR RESPECT.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.100
LYNETTE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:40.100 --> 01:44.104
I FOLLOWED YOU TO THE WAREHOUSE.
I KNOW EVERYTHING.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.437
OH, BOY.

01:46.437 --> 01:48.439
(laughs)

01:48.439 --> 01:50.110
YEAH, AT THIS POINT,

01:50.110 --> 01:53.484
I THINK I'M GONNA NEED
A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT.

01:53.484 --> 01:56.187
YOU'RE RIGHT. I SHOULDN'T
HAVE KEPT THIS FROM YOU.

01:56.187 --> 01:57.488
AND...
 (fizzes)

01:57.488 --> 02:01.752
YOU KNOW, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I WANTED TO BRING YOU IN ON IT.
 HUH?

02:01.752 --> 02:04.425
BUT I WAS AFRAID
YOU'D OVERREACT.

02:06.197 --> 02:08.329
AHH.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.860
THAT'S WHAT
YOU WERE AFRAID OF?

02:10.860 --> 02:12.533
HEY, I'M UPSET, TOO.

02:12.533 --> 02:15.866
BUT LET'S FACE IT.
BOYS WILL BE BOYS.

02:15.866 --> 02:18.869
I THINK...
I HAVE TO SIT DOWN NOW.

02:18.869 --> 02:21.342
LYNETTE,
ARE YOU REALLY SURPRISED?

02:23.414 --> 02:25.916
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
THIS HAS HAPPENED.

02:25.916 --> 02:28.819
(laughs) AND IT DEFINITELY
WON'T BE THE LAST.

02:28.819 --> 02:32.383
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE TO KILL YOU NOW.
 WELL, HE'S YOUR SON, TOO.

02:32.383 --> 02:33.854
WHO?
 PORTER!

02:33.854 --> 02:36.357
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 I FOUND OUT

02:36.357 --> 02:39.560
PORTER'S BEEN HOOKING UP WITH
SOME GIRL AT OUR WAREHOUSE.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.892
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:41.892 --> 02:43.894
AND JUST LIKE THAT,

02:43.894 --> 02:46.897
THE SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING
IN THE SCAVO HOUSE HAD ENDED...

02:46.897 --> 02:49.240
(door opens)

02:51.202 --> 02:53.774
HEY. WHAT'S UP?

02:53.774 --> 02:58.779
YOU'RE HAVING SEX WITH
YOUR BEST FRIEND'S MOTHER?!

02:58.779 --> 03:01.582
AND A HUGE FAMILY CRISIS

03:01.582 --> 03:03.584
HAD BEGUN.

03:20.771 --> 03:24.705
DESIRE--IT'S AN EMOTION
DESIGNED TO LEAD US ASTRAY,

03:24.705 --> 03:30.241
CAUSING US TO BUY THINGS
WE CAN'T AFFORD...

03:30.241 --> 03:33.984
ENCOURAGING US
TO SAMPLE DESSERTS

03:33.984 --> 03:37.217
WE DON'T NEED...

03:37.217 --> 03:39.720
AND PUSHING US
INTO LOVE AFFAIRS

03:39.720 --> 03:41.992
WE'RE CLEARLY NOT READY FOR.

03:43.754 --> 03:45.756
I WANT YOU
TO CALL THAT WOMAN

03:45.756 --> 03:48.259
AND TELL HER YOU ARE
 NEVER SEEING HER AGAIN.

03:48.259 --> 03:50.661
HER NAME IS ANNE.

03:50.661 --> 03:52.663
HER NAME IS
MRS. SCHILLING.

03:52.663 --> 03:54.665
SHE WAS YOUR T-BALL COACH
WHEN YOU WERE 6.

03:54.665 --> 03:56.637
BY THE WAY,
DOES YOUR BEST FRIEND KNOW

03:56.637 --> 03:59.009
YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH HIS MOTHER?

03:59.009 --> 04:01.712
WE'RE KEEPING OUR RELATIONSHIP
FROM KIRBY FOR NOW.

04:01.712 --> 04:03.374
THIS ISN'T A RELATIONSHIP.

04:03.374 --> 04:05.646
YOU ARE BEING USED
BY THIS WOMAN.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.978
NO, I'M NOT. I LOVE HER.

04:07.978 --> 04:09.850
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
 I'M CALLING HER.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.021
NO.
 (gasps)

04:11.021 --> 04:13.554
HEY!
 WHAT IF HER HUSBAND ANSWERS?

04:13.554 --> 04:14.925
GEE, PORTER.

04:14.925 --> 04:17.928
THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE PITFALLS
OF DATING A MARRIED WOMAN.

04:17.928 --> 04:20.430
LISTEN TO ME!
MR. SCHILLING CAN'T FIND OUT.

04:20.430 --> 04:23.634
HE--HE'S TOTALLY VIOLENT.
HE--HE WOULD KILL HER.

04:23.634 --> 04:26.737
WELL, THEN YOU HAVE PUT HER
IN A VERY DANGEROUS POSITION,

04:26.737 --> 04:28.839
HAVEN'T YOU?

04:28.839 --> 04:31.842
(sighs) OKAY. I'LL CALL HER.
I'LL TELL HER IT'S OVER.

04:31.842 --> 04:34.345
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY
THAT YOU KNOW.

04:34.345 --> 04:37.348
THAT'LL JUST FREAK HER OUT.
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME

04:37.348 --> 04:39.810
THAT YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING
TO HER PSYCHO HUSBAND.

04:39.810 --> 04:42.813
I AM NOT PROMISING ANYTHING.
 SO HELP ME, IF I FIND OUT

04:42.813 --> 04:44.955
THAT YOU DO SOMETHING,
AND SHE GETS HURT,

04:44.955 --> 04:48.989
I WILL LEAVE THIS HOUSE
AND I WILL NEVER COME BACK!
 OH, PLEASE!
YOU WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.392
YEAH? WELL, I-I'VE DONE
A LOT OF THINGS

04:51.392 --> 04:53.394
YOU NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD DO.

04:55.065 --> 04:56.997
(gasps)

04:56.997 --> 04:59.029
WAIT.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.874
WE WON'T SAY ANYTHING.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.941
BUT IF YOU DON'T END THIS,
YOU WON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.

05:10.941 --> 05:12.943
WE WILL THROW YOU OUT.

05:16.787 --> 05:19.890
SO... YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

05:19.890 --> 05:21.492
SIT.

05:21.492 --> 05:24.395
TELL US, CHARLIE...

05:24.395 --> 05:27.928
HAVE YOU ENJOYED WORKING HERE
AT MRS. VAN DE KAMP'S?

05:27.928 --> 05:30.100
YEAH. IT'S GREAT.

05:30.100 --> 05:33.604
YOU DON'T FEEL
YOU'VE BEEN UNDERPAID?
 NO.

05:33.604 --> 05:35.606
WELL, THEN PERHAPS
YOU CAN EXPLAIN

05:35.606 --> 05:38.569
WHY YOU STOLE $200 FROM
THE PETTY CASH BOX YESTERDAY.

05:38.569 --> 05:40.571
WHAT? I DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING.

05:40.571 --> 05:43.544
CHARLIE, WE WOULDN'T ACCUSE YOU
UNLESS WE HAD CONCRETE EVIDENCE,

05:43.544 --> 05:46.116
AND THANKS TO
MY DILIGENT PARTNER HERE, WE DO.

05:48.579 --> 05:51.852
(sighs)

05:51.852 --> 05:54.555
SO AM I, LIKE... FIRED?

05:54.555 --> 05:57.057
(scoffs)
YOU'RE MORE THAN "LIKE" FIRED.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.090
YOU'RE FIRED. AND, OF COURSE,
WE WANT OUR MONEY BACK.

06:00.090 --> 06:03.634
UH, I DON'T HAVE HAVE IT.
I SPENT IT.

06:03.634 --> 06:05.836
WELL, THEN I SUGGEST
YOU RETURN YOUR PURCHASE.

06:05.836 --> 06:07.838
DO YOU HAVE A RECEIPT?

06:07.838 --> 06:10.471
YEAH. YEAH, LIKE POT DEALERS
GIVE RECEIPTS.

06:10.471 --> 06:14.044
WELL, YOU'VE JUST COVERED
YOURSELF IN GLORY ON THIS ONE.

06:14.044 --> 06:17.007
JUST... PLEASE,
DON'T TELL MY PARENTS.

06:17.007 --> 06:19.510
I'LL GET YOU THE MONEY.
I PROMISE.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.557
(door opens and closes)
 CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
A THIEF AND A POTHEAD!

06:26.557 --> 06:28.559
WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW NOW

06:28.559 --> 06:31.892
WHERE THE 2 POUNDS
OF COOKIE DOUGH WENT.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.724
(sighs)

06:33.724 --> 06:34.895
(Jackson laughs)

06:34.895 --> 06:36.867
(giggles)
 TOO MANY?

06:36.867 --> 06:38.869
(laughs) YEAH.
I GOTTA HAVE ONE MORE. AH!

06:38.869 --> 06:40.871
(chuckles)

06:40.871 --> 06:42.873
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS.

06:42.873 --> 06:45.876
AH, WELL... WE NEEDED
TO WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN, RIGHT?

06:45.876 --> 06:47.177
MM.
 AND HONESTLY?

06:47.177 --> 06:51.041
THIS IS THE BEST
SECOND FIRST DATE I'VE EVER HAD.

06:51.041 --> 06:52.182
ISN'T IT?

06:52.182 --> 06:53.544
MM.

06:53.544 --> 06:56.046
AND KNOWING
WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE SEX

06:56.046 --> 06:58.489
TAKES ALL THE PRESSURE OFF.

06:58.489 --> 07:01.091
THAT'S... SOMETHING WE KNOW?

07:01.091 --> 07:02.693
YES.

07:02.693 --> 07:04.655
WE'RE STARTING
COMPLETELY OVER,

07:04.655 --> 07:07.758
SO THIS TIME,
WE'RE GONNA DO THINGS RIGHT.

07:07.758 --> 07:09.960
W-WHICH MEANS WHAT?

07:09.960 --> 07:12.563
WELL, IT MEANS...

07:12.563 --> 07:15.936
NO SEX UNTIL
AT LEAST DATE FOUR.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.038
AH.
 I WANT US
TO SPEND THIS TIME

07:18.038 --> 07:20.971
REALLY GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

07:20.971 --> 07:24.114
I-I DO KNOW YOU.
 WHAT'S MY LEAST FAVORITE WORD?

07:24.114 --> 07:25.616
"PHLEGM."

07:25.616 --> 07:27.948
(laughs)
YOU'RE JUST GUESSING.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.650
IT'S "PANTIES."

07:29.650 --> 07:32.653
OHH.
 ALTHOUGH SOME DAYS
IT'S "LARVA" OR "CHUNKS."

07:32.653 --> 07:34.955
WELL, I WILL TRY
TO REMEMBER THAT.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.228
MM. NOW YOU TELL ME SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.

07:39.990 --> 07:41.662
OKAY.

07:43.794 --> 07:45.095
I'M A PAINTER.

07:45.095 --> 07:46.637
(laughs)

07:46.637 --> 07:49.670
I SORT OF GUESSED THAT
WHEN YOU PAINTED MY HOUSE.

07:49.670 --> 07:54.074
I MEAN, I PAINT... ART.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.247
LIKE... ON A CANVAS,
IN A FRAME.

07:57.247 --> 07:59.810
SERIOUSLY?

07:59.810 --> 08:02.182
I WENT TO ART SCHOOL
IN PARIS.

08:02.182 --> 08:05.916
AND MY PROFESSOR HAD A BERET,
SO YOU KNOW HE WAS GOOD.

08:05.916 --> 08:07.117
(laughs)

08:07.117 --> 08:10.591
WOW.

08:10.591 --> 08:14.494
SO NOW YOU'RE PAINTING...
MY BATHROOM?

08:14.494 --> 08:15.666
YEAH.

08:15.666 --> 08:18.098
(chuckles) IT SUCKS.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.631
BUT I'VE BEEN BLOCKED
FOR THE PAST YEAR.

08:20.631 --> 08:22.032
BLOCKED?
 YEAH.

08:22.032 --> 08:25.275
I MEAN, I KEEP TRYING
TO START NEW PIECES, BUT...

08:25.275 --> 08:30.510
NOTHING COMES.
IT'S... DRIVING ME CRAZY.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.784
WELL, I'M SORRY THINGS
AREN'T GOING WELL.

08:33.784 --> 08:36.046
BUT I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME.

08:36.046 --> 08:38.749
SEE? WE'RE GETTING TO KNOW
EACH OTHER.

08:38.749 --> 08:41.751
AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE IF WE'D
SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT IN BED.

08:41.751 --> 08:43.994
YEAH.

08:43.994 --> 08:47.027
AND NOW I'M CREATIVELY
 AND SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.099
(laughs)

08:49.099 --> 08:51.832
FIRST DATES ARE AWESOME.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.163
(laughs)

08:56.006 --> 08:59.009
JEEZ, ROBERTA, I KNOW YOU HATE
TO THROW ANYTHING AWAY,

08:59.009 --> 09:02.072
BUT DO YOU HAVE THE GARBAGEMEN
BRINGING YOU STUFF NOW?

09:02.072 --> 09:05.075
PARDON MY FRENCH, BUT WHAT'S
FRENCH FOR "KISS MY ASS"?

09:05.075 --> 09:07.077
SO YOU SAID
DAVE HAS A SECRET.

09:07.077 --> 09:09.219
NOW HOW YOU GETTIN' THAT
FROM THIS?

09:09.219 --> 09:12.883
IT'S JUST A BUNCH
OF PHONE NUMBERS.
 YEAH, IT MAY BE JUST
A BUNCH OF NUMBERS TO YOU,

09:12.883 --> 09:15.055
BUT TO A SAVVY SLEUTH
WITH A KEEN EYE

09:15.055 --> 09:18.589
AND THE NOSE
OF A BLOODHOUND--
 YEAH, YEAH, YOU'RE MISS MARPLE
WITH A BUM LIVER.

09:18.589 --> 09:20.090
SO WHAT'S HE HIDING?

09:20.090 --> 09:23.093
LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH IT.
AROUND THE 1st OF EVERY MONTH,

09:23.093 --> 09:25.596
DAVE GETS A STRING OF CALLS--
FIVE OR SIX--

09:25.596 --> 09:27.638
FROM THIS NUMBER IN BOSTON.

09:27.638 --> 09:30.200
THEY'RE ALL SHORT--
10, 15 SECONDS.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.173
MY GUESS IS
HE'S NOT PICKING UP.

09:33.173 --> 09:36.176
SOMEBODY'S LEAVING HIM MESSAGES.
YOU KNOW, BUGGIN' HIM.
 ONCE A MONTH, HUH?

09:36.176 --> 09:39.049
MY GUESS IS IT'S AN EX-WIFE
LOOKING FOR HER ALIMONY.

09:39.049 --> 09:41.051
EXCEPT IT'S NOT.
YOU SEE THIS?

09:41.051 --> 09:43.754
AFTER A FEW DAYS,
HE ALWAYS CALLS BACK.

09:43.754 --> 09:46.216
AND WHO, YOU ASK,
IS HE CALLING?

09:46.216 --> 09:48.088
A HOSPITAL IN BOSTON.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.161
IT'S THE OFFICE
OF DR. SAMUEL HELLER...

09:51.161 --> 09:52.863
PSYCHIATRIST.

09:56.126 --> 09:59.129
SO... ONCE A MONTH,

09:59.129 --> 10:01.632
DAVE WHINES ABOUT HIS LIFE

10:01.632 --> 10:06.076
TO A BEANTOWN HEADSHRINKER,
HUH?

10:06.076 --> 10:08.138
BIG WHOOP.
 (scoffs)

10:08.138 --> 10:10.310
I LOOKED UP YOUR DAVEY'S DOC
ON THE WEB.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.312
HE'S NOT
YOUR GARDEN-VARIETY SHRINK.

10:12.312 --> 10:15.285
HE'S A RENOWNED PSYCHIATRIST
AND PUBLISHED AUTHOR

10:15.285 --> 10:19.289
WITH A VERY SPECIALIZED
FIELD OF EXPERTISE.

10:19.289 --> 10:21.321
(taps keys, computer beeps)

10:21.321 --> 10:23.323
AND THAT, MY DEAR WATSON,

10:23.323 --> 10:26.697
IS YOUR NEIGHBOR'S
LITTLE SECRET.

10:43.674 --> 10:45.676
(girl)
YOU'RE RIGHT ON TOP OF ME!

10:45.676 --> 10:47.748
(girl screams and laughs)

10:47.748 --> 10:49.750
OH, LAP OF LUXURY,

10:49.750 --> 10:52.723
HOW I'VE MISSED
SITTING IN YOU.

10:52.723 --> 10:56.126
CELIA! JUANITA!

10:56.126 --> 10:59.189
CHEF IS TAKING FRESH-BAKED
COOKIES OUT OF THE OVEN.

10:59.189 --> 11:00.390
(girls laugh)

11:00.390 --> 11:02.793
(laughs)
 YOU'RE NOT GONNA CATCH ME!

11:02.793 --> 11:05.095
OH, I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW NICE IT IS

11:05.095 --> 11:08.298
TO HEAR THE SOUND OF CHILDREN'S
LAUGHTER IN THIS HOUSE.

11:08.298 --> 11:10.370
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING?

11:10.370 --> 11:12.402
WHY DON'T YOU ALL
STAY THE WEEKEND?

11:12.402 --> 11:16.176
OOH, WE'D LOVE TO.
 JEEZ, WE CAN'T.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.178
WHY NOT?
 CELIA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY
IS SUNDAY.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.310
WE'VE GOTTA GET READY
FOR IT, REMEMBER?

11:20.310 --> 11:23.153
WHAT'S TO GET READY?
YOU BUY A $9 SHEET CAKE

11:23.153 --> 11:26.156
AND FLING A PIÑATA
OVER A TREE AND BAM! PARTY TIME.

11:26.156 --> 11:28.018
BUT I DON'T HAVE
A CHANGE OF CLOTHES.

11:28.018 --> 11:30.921
MY NEPHEW LEFT A WHOLE CLOSET
FULL OF OLD CLOTHES.

11:30.921 --> 11:32.923
I'M SURE SOMETHING
WILL FIT YOU.

11:32.923 --> 11:35.926
(sighs) WELL...
 CARLOS, JUST NOD YOUR HEAD,

11:35.926 --> 11:39.099
'CAUSE I AIN'T LEAVING
THIS POOL.
 OH, GOOD. IT'S SETTLED.

11:39.099 --> 11:42.402
OH, GABY.
YOUR MARGARITA'S GETTING LOW.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.135
I'LL SEND BRANDON OUT
WITH A FRESH ONE.

11:45.135 --> 11:47.207
THANK YOU.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.140
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:50.140 --> 11:52.142
WHAT? YOU HEARD THE WOMAN.
SHE WANTS CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER.

11:52.142 --> 11:54.845
AND I WANT THE LOBSTER
THE CHEF IS SERVING FOR DINNER.

11:54.845 --> 11:57.387
IT'S A WIN-WIN.
 I JUST DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
WITH THIS.

11:57.387 --> 11:58.919
WHY NOT?

11:58.919 --> 12:01.752
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
IT'S LIKE SHANGRI-LA.

12:01.752 --> 12:04.124
WOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THE PITCH BLACK I SEE HERE

12:04.124 --> 12:06.296
IS MUCH MORE DAZZLING
THAN THE ONE AT HOME.

12:06.296 --> 12:08.328
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

12:08.328 --> 12:10.330
MY PROBLEM IS
THAT IT'S A BAD IDEA

12:10.330 --> 12:12.032
TO MIX BUSINESS AND PLEASURE.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.765
SAYS THE MAN WHO MASSAGED HER
INTO AN ORGASM.

12:14.765 --> 12:17.938
EVEN MORE REASON TO KEEP
SOME PROFESSIONAL DISTANCE.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.210
CARLOS, SHE IS JUST
A LONELY OLD WOMAN

12:20.210 --> 12:22.873
YEARNING FOR SOME FRIENDSHIP
AND HUMAN CONTACT.

12:22.873 --> 12:25.876
AND I, FOR ONE,
AM HAPPY TO BE THAT HUMAN.

12:25.876 --> 12:27.878
(footsteps approaching)

12:27.878 --> 12:30.150
MRS. SOLIS? YOUR MARGARITA.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.384
OH, SHOOT.
I CAN'T REACH IT.

12:44.194 --> 12:46.036
MMM!

12:53.373 --> 12:55.375
(Dave) HEY, GUYS.
SORRY I'M LATE.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.377
HEY.
 (Mike) YOU BRING BEER?

12:57.377 --> 12:59.880
WAS I SUPPOSED TO?
 (Orson) NO.
 TOM WAS SUPPOSED TO.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.953
GOSH. SORRY. I THOUGHT
THE TWO CASES I BOUGHT MONDAY

13:02.953 --> 13:04.955
WOULD'VE LASTED
MORE THAN ONE REHEARSAL.

13:04.955 --> 13:06.957
BOYS, WE'RE BETTER OFF
NOT DRINKING TODAY.

13:06.957 --> 13:09.960
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO
AND ONLY ONE WEEK TO DO IT.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.962
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:11.962 --> 13:13.423
WE ARE PLAYING

13:13.423 --> 13:17.567
BATTLE OF THE BANDS
AT THE WHITE HORSE! (laughs)

13:17.567 --> 13:21.201
UH, DAVE? BATTLE OF THE BANDS
ISN'T FOR AMATEURS.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.373
(Tom) YOU GOTTA AUDITION.

13:23.373 --> 13:25.075
UH, WE DON'T.

13:25.075 --> 13:27.807
EDIE'S GOT A REAL ESTATE BUDDY
WHOSE HUSBAND OWNS THE CLUB.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.981
YOU'RE KIDDING.
 WE'RE PLAYING AN ACTUAL GIG?

13:30.981 --> 13:32.943
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE
WHO AREN'T LISTENING

13:32.943 --> 13:35.846
JUST BECAUSE
I PAY THEIR ALLOWANCE?
 WELL, THIS IS FANTASTIC!

13:35.846 --> 13:38.148
YES! BUT THAT MEANS
THE PRESSURE'S ON.

13:38.148 --> 13:40.851
WE GOTTA REALLY REHEARSE
OUR COVER STUFF

13:40.851 --> 13:42.853
AND... WE NEED
AN ORIGINAL SONG.

13:42.853 --> 13:45.055
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT SONGWRITING.

13:45.055 --> 13:47.197
I-I KNOW A LITTLE BIT.
 NO, YOU DON'T.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.931
IT'S FINE. MIKE AND I
WILL WRITE SOMETHING.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.864
YOU GOT A LITTLE TIME LATER?
 NOT TONIGHT. I GOT PLANS.

13:53.864 --> 13:57.207
"PLANS"?

13:57.207 --> 13:58.869
WHAT'S HER NAME?

14:00.240 --> 14:03.213
CAN WE JUST REHEARSE,
PLEASE?

14:03.213 --> 14:07.517
YOU KNOW, I HEARD THAT
SUSAN AND JACKSON BROKE UP.
 I HEARD
THEY GOT BACK TOGETHER.

14:07.517 --> 14:09.950
IT'S NOT SUSAN.
STOP GUESSING.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.521
ALSO, GET LIVES.

14:11.521 --> 14:13.153
WHATEVER, MIKE,

14:13.153 --> 14:15.625
JUST SO LONG
AS YOU'RE HAVING FUN.

14:19.159 --> 14:23.463
(penguin) HEY! WHO SAID YOU--
TURN THE BOARD AROUND.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.436
GET BACK HERE.
 (penguin) NO! COME OUT HERE
AND SHOW ME SOME MOVES!

14:26.436 --> 14:28.438
(knock on door)
 SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

14:28.438 --> 14:31.972
JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU NEEDED
ANYTHING BEFORE I GO OFF TO BED.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.975
NO, WE'RE GOOD.
 SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO
ORDER MARGARITA NUMBER 12?

14:34.975 --> 14:37.277
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO SHUT YOUR PIEHOLE?

14:37.277 --> 14:39.980
(laughs) IT'S SO CUTE,
HOW YOU TWO BICKER.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.282
CARLOS, HOW DO THOSE PAJAMAS
FIT YOU?

14:42.282 --> 14:43.613
THEY'RE PERFECT.

14:43.613 --> 14:46.486
I-I HOPE YOUR NEPHEW DOESN'T
MIND THAT I WAS WEARING 'EM.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.189
HE'LL NEVER KNOW.
WE'RE ESTRANGED.

14:49.189 --> 14:52.392
OH. OKAY. (chuckles)

14:54.024 --> 14:57.627
ANYWAY, WE'RE GOOD.
SO HAVE A NICE NIGHT. (chuckles)

14:57.627 --> 15:01.071
(gasps) OH! WHAT'S THAT?

15:01.071 --> 15:02.902
SOME ANIMATED THING.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.204
I LOVE ANIMATED MOVIES.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.206
THE GIRLS WANTED TO WATCH IT,

15:06.206 --> 15:09.179
SO WE'RE KIND OF HAVING
A FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT.

15:09.179 --> 15:11.441
OOH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN!

15:11.441 --> 15:13.143
(laughs)

15:13.143 --> 15:15.615
MY HEAVENS,
IS THAT PENGUIN SURFING?

15:15.615 --> 15:19.549
GEE, I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T
REALLY SEE THE SCREEN ANYMORE.

15:19.549 --> 15:21.691
OH, DEAR.
I'M BEING RUDE.

15:21.691 --> 15:24.124
OH, THAT'S OKAY. (chuckles)

15:28.198 --> 15:30.400
(laughs)

15:30.400 --> 15:33.233
THERE. THAT'S BETTER.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.236
(speaking indistinctly)

15:36.236 --> 15:39.209
DID SHE JUST CRAWL UNDER...
 (whispers) OH, YEAH.

15:39.209 --> 15:43.343
(laughing)

15:43.343 --> 15:46.046
AND SO THERE I WAS
IN NINTH GRADE,

15:46.046 --> 15:48.348
AND MY BOOBS HAD NOT
MADE AN APPEARANCE.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.150
I WAS DESPERATE.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.152
HERE. LET ME REFILL THAT
FOR YOU.

15:52.152 --> 15:55.085
AND SO THAT'S WHEN
I GOT CAUGHT STUFFING

15:55.085 --> 15:57.087
AT THE PEP RALLY.

15:57.087 --> 15:59.229
AND SIX MONTHS LATER...
KABOOM.

15:59.229 --> 16:03.163
I WAS VOTED PROM QUEEN.
NICE WORK, GIRLS.

16:03.163 --> 16:06.166
(smooth jazz music playing)

16:08.268 --> 16:10.270
STOP THAT RIGHT NOW.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.141
WHAT?

16:11.141 --> 16:13.243
THE SEX MUSIC.
TURN IT OFF.

16:13.243 --> 16:15.145
THAT--THAT'S NOT SEX MUSIC.

16:15.145 --> 16:19.279
(saxophone solo playing)

16:19.279 --> 16:21.281
(turns off music)

16:21.281 --> 16:24.114
WE ARE NOT HAVING SEX
UNTIL DATE NUMBER FOUR,

16:24.114 --> 16:26.116
AND THIS IS
DATE NUMBER TWO.

16:26.116 --> 16:28.118
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

16:28.118 --> 16:31.191
IT--IT'S JUST THAT YOU
LOOK SO HOT IN THESE PANTS,

16:31.191 --> 16:33.193
AND YOUR HAIR
SMELLS SO GOOD.

16:33.193 --> 16:36.166
AND YOUR EYES...

16:36.166 --> 16:39.299
(groans) LOOK,
I MADE YOU DINNER. COME ON.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.631
JACKSON--
 I BRAISED BEEF FOR YOU.

16:41.631 --> 16:45.235
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A PAIN
IN THE ASS IT IS TO BRAISE MEAT?

16:45.235 --> 16:47.537
OKAY, DO YOU KNOW
HOW SAD IT MAKES ME

16:47.537 --> 16:50.380
TO KNOW THAT YOU ONLY
BRAISED IT TO BOINK ME?

16:50.380 --> 16:53.213
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
ASKING ME QUESTIONS.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.345
THE POINT OF ALL THIS WAS TO
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER.

16:55.345 --> 16:57.687
HOW IS IT GONNA MAKE
OUR RELATIONSHIP STRONGER

16:57.687 --> 17:00.350
FOR ME TO KNOW
THAT IN THE FIFTH GRADE,

17:00.350 --> 17:02.192
THEY SENT YOU
TO THE THERAPIST

17:02.192 --> 17:04.194
'CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T STOP
CHEWING YOUR HAIR?

17:04.194 --> 17:06.356
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS
HARD FOR ME TO SHARE,

17:06.356 --> 17:09.529
AND THE FACT THAT
YOU JUST MAKE LIGHT OF IT...

17:09.529 --> 17:13.063
NO, I'M AM CALLING
THE SECOND DATE OFFICIALLY OVER.

17:13.063 --> 17:14.534
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:14.534 --> 17:17.537
I WAS GOING TO LET YOU
FEEL ME UP OVER MY BLOUSE.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.769
BUT NOW? NADA.

17:24.574 --> 17:26.576
(door closes)

17:26.576 --> 17:29.579
(sighs)

17:46.636 --> 17:48.738
(indistinct conversations)

17:48.738 --> 17:51.271
SO BEFORE WE WRAP UP HERE,

17:51.271 --> 17:54.204
WE STILL NEED SOME CHAPERONES
FOR THE JUNIOR PROM.

17:54.204 --> 17:56.176
ANNE SCHILLING IS
COORDINATING THE VOLUNTEERS,

17:56.176 --> 17:58.178
AND SHE COULD REALLY USE
SOME HELP.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.782
NOBODY? (chuckles)

18:07.517 --> 18:09.519
I KNOW WE'RE ALL BUSY,

18:09.519 --> 18:11.521
BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT.

18:11.521 --> 18:15.325
WE WANT OUR KIDS TO HAVE FUN,
BUT LET'S FACE IT.

18:15.325 --> 18:17.527
IF WE DON'T
KEEP AN EYE ON THEM,

18:17.527 --> 18:20.530
GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT KIND
OF TROUBLE THEY'LL GET INTO.

18:20.530 --> 18:21.531
(chuckles)

18:21.531 --> 18:22.872
(scattered laughter)

18:22.872 --> 18:24.674
HELEN?

18:24.674 --> 18:27.137
MARJORIE? YOU'LL HELP?

18:27.137 --> 18:30.780
FANTASTIC. THANKS, GUYS.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.690
HEY, LYNETTE.

18:42.592 --> 18:44.594
DO THESE MEETINGS
KEEP GETTING LONGER,

18:44.594 --> 18:47.297
OR DO THEY JUST
SEEM THAT WAY?

18:48.728 --> 18:50.400
I DON'T KNOW.

18:52.262 --> 18:53.563
SO...

18:53.563 --> 18:56.306
HOW'S THE FAMILY?

18:56.306 --> 18:58.608
I HAVEN'T SEEN PENNY
IN SO LONG,

18:58.608 --> 19:01.371
AND ALL THE KIDS
ARE GETTING SO BIG NOW.

19:01.371 --> 19:04.244
I GUESS THE BOYS WILL BE
GOING OFF TO COLLEGE SOON.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.145
AAH! LYNETTE!

19:06.145 --> 19:08.147
I KNOW EVERYTHING, OKAY?

19:10.680 --> 19:13.253
LOOK...

19:13.253 --> 19:16.286
I'M SORRY, BUT...

19:16.286 --> 19:19.829
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU
TO UNDERSTAND...

19:19.829 --> 19:21.891
I LOVE PORTER.

19:21.891 --> 19:24.434
AAH! AAH! OH!

19:24.434 --> 19:26.266
(thud)
 AAH!

19:26.266 --> 19:28.238
(grunts) SO DO I.

19:28.238 --> 19:31.371
AND IF YOU EVER
LAY A HAND ON HIM AGAIN,

19:31.371 --> 19:36.276
YOU WILL FIND OUT
 JUST HOW MUCH.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.848
(grunts)

19:38.848 --> 19:41.481
(sighs)

19:49.619 --> 19:51.721
(door opens)

19:51.721 --> 19:55.565
OH, BREE.
I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS.

19:55.565 --> 19:57.627
ME, TOO. YOU GO FIRST.

19:57.627 --> 20:01.471
I HIRED A GIRL TO REPLACE
THAT THIEF CHARLIE.

20:01.471 --> 20:04.334
OH. WELL, ARE YOU SURE
SHE'S TRUSTWORTHY?

20:04.334 --> 20:06.336
WELL, SHE COMES WITH
A STRONG RECOMMENDATION

20:06.336 --> 20:09.339
FROM THE HEAD OF
THE LOCAL F.B.I. OFFICE--

20:09.339 --> 20:10.880
HER FATHER, WHO'S MORMON.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.642
WELL DONE, ORSON!

20:12.642 --> 20:14.644
THANK YOU. YOUR TURN.

20:14.644 --> 20:16.316
OOH! OH. (clears throat)

20:16.316 --> 20:18.318
"THE NEW CHRISTIAN READER"
JUST PUBLISHED

20:18.318 --> 20:20.950
AN ADVANCE REVIEW
OF MY COOKBOOK. LISTEN!

20:20.950 --> 20:23.723
"MRS. VAN DE KAMP'S COLORFUL
STORIES OF HER UPBRINGING

20:23.723 --> 20:25.725
"SHOW HER UPSTANDING VALUES,

20:25.725 --> 20:28.498
BUT HER RECIPES
ARE SINFULLY DELICIOUS."

20:28.498 --> 20:31.601
THEY GAVE ME FOUR HALOS!

20:31.601 --> 20:34.334
THEN I THINK
THIS IS APPROPRIATE--

20:34.334 --> 20:35.635
HOLY COW!

20:35.635 --> 20:37.467
(laughs)

20:37.467 --> 20:39.339
I HAVE TO ADMIT,

20:39.339 --> 20:41.641
I HAD SOME RESERVATIONS
ABOUT US WORKING TOGETHER,

20:41.641 --> 20:44.614
BUT THIS HAS SUCCEEDED
BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS.

20:44.614 --> 20:47.447
MMM. WE'RE QUITE A TEAM,
AREN'T WE?

20:47.447 --> 20:49.449
YEAH, AND THE BEST PART IS

20:49.449 --> 20:51.951
WE GET TO SEE EACH OTHER
ALL THE TIME.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.454
MM-HMM, I KNOW,
WHICH MAKES THE HARDEST PART

20:54.454 --> 20:57.627
KEEPING MY HANDS OFF YOU
ALL THE TIME.
 (glasses clatter)

20:57.627 --> 20:59.258
(gasps) ORSON!

20:59.258 --> 21:01.331
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!
HERE?

21:01.331 --> 21:03.293
MM-HMM.

21:03.293 --> 21:05.795
THIS KITCHEN IS THE BIRTHPLACE
OF OUR TRIUMPHS.

21:05.795 --> 21:09.339
WHAT BETTER PLACE
TO CELEBRATE THEM, HMM?

21:11.671 --> 21:14.844
OOH! OH, THIS COUNTER'S
HARD ON MY HEAD.

21:14.844 --> 21:16.846
DO YOU WANT ME TO STOP?

21:16.846 --> 21:18.848
NO. GET ME AN OVEN MITT.

21:18.848 --> 21:20.009
RIGHT.

21:20.009 --> 21:22.982
OH, MUCH BETTER.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.284
RISE AND SHINE, GIRLS.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.357
RISE AND SHI--

21:27.357 --> 21:29.389
OH, MY GOD!

21:29.389 --> 21:31.391
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

21:31.391 --> 21:34.394
GABY, IT'S FINE. WE'RE JUST
DOING A LITTLE ART PROJECT.

21:34.394 --> 21:37.367
I TOLD THE THE GIRLS

21:37.367 --> 21:39.699
THEY COULD DECORATE THE ROOM
ANY WAY THEY WANTED.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.471
I'M MAKING A CASTLE.

21:41.471 --> 21:42.632
IT'S STUPID.

21:42.632 --> 21:45.475
NO, YOU'RE STUPID!

21:45.475 --> 21:47.477
YOU'RE BOTH STUPID.
STOP IT!

21:47.477 --> 21:49.879
UM, MRS. HILDEBRAND,
THIS IS REALLY NICE OF YOU.

21:49.879 --> 21:52.882
BUT WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO RUIN YOUR BEAUTIFUL ROOM?

21:52.882 --> 21:56.346
OH, IT'S NOT MY ROOM ANYMORE.
IT'S THEIR ROOM.

21:56.346 --> 21:57.717
WHAT?

21:57.717 --> 22:00.390
YES. IT'S THE ROOM
THEY'LL BE STAYING IN

22:00.390 --> 22:02.452
WHENEVER YOU COME
TO VISIT.

22:02.452 --> 22:04.724
THEY'RE GETTING A NEW TV,
BUNK BEDS.

22:04.724 --> 22:07.957
I'LL HAVE IT READY BY THE TIME
YOU GET HERE NEXT WEEKEND.

22:07.957 --> 22:11.330
UH... NEXT WEEKEND, UH,

22:11.330 --> 22:13.463
CARLOS AND I HAVE PLANS.

22:13.463 --> 22:17.707
WELL, I BET THE GIRLS DON'T.
I'LL SEND A CAR FOR THEM.

22:17.707 --> 22:19.439
I... DON'T THINK

22:19.439 --> 22:21.441
THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

22:21.441 --> 22:25.545
HOW ABOUT IT, GIRLS?
WANNA SPEND NEXT WEEKEND HERE?
 (Celia) YAY!

22:25.545 --> 22:27.547
YAY!
THANK YOU. MRS. HILDEBRAND.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.919
OH! OH!
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

22:29.919 --> 22:32.081
SORRY. THANK YOU, GRANDMA.

22:32.081 --> 22:33.783
(Virginia laughs)

22:33.783 --> 22:35.425
OH, COME!

22:35.425 --> 22:36.786
OH! OH.

22:36.786 --> 22:40.460
OOH! OOH! (laughing)

22:40.460 --> 22:43.933
"GRANDMA"? SHE TOLD THEM
TO CALL HER "GRANDMA"?

22:43.933 --> 22:45.935
YEAH, AND THAT'S WHY
WE'RE LEAVING.

22:45.935 --> 22:47.937
AFTER YOU TOLD HER
YOU'D STAY ALL WEEKEND?

22:47.937 --> 22:50.940
HOW WE GONNA DO THAT?
 I DON'T KNOW. MAKE AN EXCUSE.

22:50.940 --> 22:53.943
SAY YOU HAVE SOME BLIND THING
YOU HAVE TO GO TO.

22:53.943 --> 22:55.945
(sighs) WE HAVE TO BE
VERY CAREFUL HERE.

22:55.945 --> 22:58.448
THIS WOMAN HAS A LOT OF PULL
AT THE COUNTRY CLUB.

22:58.448 --> 23:01.451
PLUS, WE'VE GOT
THAT EUROPE TRIP COMING UP.
 WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

23:01.451 --> 23:05.384
WE'RE NOT GOING TO EUROPE
WITH GRANDMA NUTJOB.
 I'M NOT WALKING AWAY
FROM $100,000.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.156
WE NEED THAT MONEY.
 CARLOS, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

23:07.156 --> 23:10.560
SHE'S REALLY STARTING
TO FREAK ME OUT.
 DAMN IT, GABY.

23:10.560 --> 23:13.563
I TOLD YOU IT WAS DANGEROUS
GETTING CHUMMY WITH THE CLIENTS.

23:13.563 --> 23:15.865
YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN. YOU HAD
TO STAY FOR THE LOBSTER.

23:15.865 --> 23:18.868
HEY, I SEEM TO REMEMBER SOME
MELTED BUTTER ON YOUR BIB, TOO.

23:18.868 --> 23:20.900
NOW HOW WE GETTING
OUT OF HERE?

23:20.900 --> 23:22.902
LOOK, SHE KNOWS WE'VE GOT
CELIA'S PARTY TOMORROW.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.905
I'LL TELL HER WE HAVE
TO GO SHOPPING FOR THAT.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.007
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

23:28.007 --> 23:30.680
(sighs deeply)

23:30.680 --> 23:33.683
(children laughing)

23:33.683 --> 23:35.144
(sighs) SORRY.

23:35.144 --> 23:37.847
I HAD TO WAIT FOR MY FOLKS
TO GO TO THE STORE

23:37.847 --> 23:40.850
BEFORE I COULD SNEAK OUT.
WHAT'S WRONG?

23:43.453 --> 23:44.894
ARE YOU OKAY?

23:44.894 --> 23:48.157
(voice breaks)
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

23:48.157 --> 23:51.461
(chuckles nervously)
ABOUT WHAT? LET ME HELP YOU.

23:51.461 --> 23:54.063
(scoffs)
IT'S JUST ALL SUCH A MESS.

23:54.063 --> 23:56.566
WAIT.
IS THIS ABOUT MY MOM?

23:56.566 --> 23:59.138
DID SHE DO SOMETHING ELSE
TO YOU?

23:59.138 --> 24:02.111
DID SHE CALL YOUR HUSBAND?
 NO.

24:02.111 --> 24:04.644
WELL, THEN WHAT? TELL ME.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.482
I'M PREGNANT.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.992
(laughing)

24:28.538 --> 24:31.671
HEY, DO YOU MIND
IF I CUT OUT EARLY TODAY?

24:31.671 --> 24:33.673
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.506
I MEAN, EVERYTHING'S, UH,
PRETTY MUCH DONE HERE.

24:36.506 --> 24:38.808
YOU CAN GO NOW IF YOU LIKE.
 THANKS.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.183
ANDREW.
DON'T YOU LOOK HANDSOME?

24:44.183 --> 24:46.085
DO I? GREAT.

24:47.587 --> 24:50.019
SOMETHING WRONG?

24:50.019 --> 24:54.063
YOU REMEMBER CHARLIE, THE KID
YOU GUYS FIRED FOR STEALING?

24:54.063 --> 24:57.166
WELL, HE CALLED AND ASKED
HOW YOU COULD PROVE IT,

24:57.166 --> 25:00.700
AND I SAID, "WE'VE GOT
A SURVEILLANCE TAPE, SCUZZBALL."

25:00.700 --> 25:02.702
WELL, UH, GUESS WHO STOLE

25:02.702 --> 25:04.704
THE SURVEILLANCE TAPE
LAST NIGHT.

25:04.704 --> 25:07.076
THAT DOES IT.
WE'RE PRESSING CHARGES.

25:07.076 --> 25:09.739
UH, YOU--YOU MIGHT WANT
TO HOLD OFF ON THAT,

25:09.739 --> 25:11.741
BECAUSE ACCORDING
TO CHARLIE,

25:11.741 --> 25:14.243
THE SURVEILLANCE TAPE
IS ALSO A SEX TAPE.

25:16.746 --> 25:19.188
WHAT?

25:19.188 --> 25:22.191
YEAH, HE SAID IT SHOWS
A COUPLE REALLY GOING AT IT.

25:22.191 --> 25:23.723
SO...

25:23.723 --> 25:26.556
ANY IDEA WHO
THOSE CRAZY KIDS MIGHT BE?

25:26.556 --> 25:28.858
OH, DEAR GOD.

25:28.858 --> 25:31.530
YEP. KINDA THOUGHT SO.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.733
HOW COULD THIS BE HAPPENING?

25:33.733 --> 25:36.065
(lowered voice)
BEFORE ANYTHING GOT SERIOUS,

25:36.065 --> 25:39.238
I MADE A POINT
OF TURNING THE CAMERA OFF.

25:39.238 --> 25:42.742
(lowered voice)
WAIT, I TURNED IT OFF, TOO.
 I DIDN'T SEE YOU DO THAT.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.214
NO, YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR THE OLIVE OIL.

25:45.214 --> 25:47.246
OBVIOUSLY,
YOU TURNED IT BACK ON.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.247
(groans softly)

25:48.247 --> 25:49.919
(chuckles nervously)

25:49.919 --> 25:52.922
(normal voice) WE NEED
TO, UM, GET THAT TAPE BACK.

25:52.922 --> 25:55.284
YEAH, WELL,
BREAK OUT YOUR CHECKBOOK,

25:55.284 --> 25:58.327
'CAUSE HE WANTS
2 GRAND FOR IT.
 $2,000?!

25:58.327 --> 26:01.130
YEAH, OR HE'S GONNA
POST IT ON YouTube.

26:01.130 --> 26:04.063
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
 WELL,
FIRST YOU NEED TO DECIDE

26:04.063 --> 26:06.065
WHAT YOUR PORN NAMES
ARE GONNA BE.

26:06.065 --> 26:09.068
OKAY, THIS IS NOT A JOKE.
MY BOOK COMES OUT NEXT MONTH--

26:09.068 --> 26:11.270
MY OLD-FASHIONED,
TRADITIONAL COOKBOOK!

26:11.270 --> 26:13.242
THIS COULD RUIN ME!

26:13.242 --> 26:16.305
ALL RIGHT, BREE.
WE'LL JUST PAY HIM.

26:16.305 --> 26:18.808
NO! I-I REFUSE TO PAY BLACKMAIL
TO SOME HOOLIGAN

26:18.808 --> 26:22.081
WHO'S STOLEN FROM US TWICE!

26:24.353 --> 26:26.015
ANDREW... (chuckles)

26:26.015 --> 26:29.659
ALL MY LIFE, I HAVE
DONE MY BEST TO TEACH YOU

26:29.659 --> 26:32.021
TO RESPECT GOD AND THE LAW

26:32.021 --> 26:34.924
AND NEVER TO HARM
ANOTHER LIVING THING.

26:36.265 --> 26:39.268
I WANT YOU TO FORGET
EVERY ONE OF THOSE LESSONS

26:39.268 --> 26:42.271
IF IT'LL HELP YOU
GET THAT TAPE BACK.

26:42.271 --> 26:43.703
WOW.

26:43.703 --> 26:46.205
SO... CARTE BLANCHE?

26:46.205 --> 26:48.207
UH... WITHIN REASON.

26:48.207 --> 26:51.881
WE ARE NOT CONDONING
ARSON OR VIOLENCE OR--

26:51.881 --> 26:55.885
ORSON, DON'T CRAMP
THE BOY'S STYLE.

27:06.956 --> 27:09.959
(cheering, shouting at once)

27:12.832 --> 27:14.664
YAY!

27:14.664 --> 27:17.166
HEY, SWEETIE. NOW DON'T
FORGET TO MAKE A WISH.

27:17.166 --> 27:18.668
(blows)

27:18.668 --> 27:20.670
(Gabrielle) YAY!

27:20.670 --> 27:22.872
(child) HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

27:22.872 --> 27:24.844
(child) HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

27:24.844 --> 27:28.247
(children speaking indistinctly)

27:32.321 --> 27:36.085
VIRGINIA! WHAT, UH,
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

27:36.085 --> 27:38.988
I CAME TO GIVE CELIA
HER BIRTHDAY GIFT.

27:38.988 --> 27:41.290
WELL, SHE'S A LITTLE BUSY
WITH HER FRIENDS RIGHT NOW,

27:41.290 --> 27:44.293
SO JUST GIVE IT TO ME,
AND I'LL MAKE SURE SHE GETS IT.

27:44.293 --> 27:46.996
(laughs) I'M AFRAID
THAT WON'T BE POSSIBLE.

27:46.996 --> 27:49.999
YOU SEE, FOR MY PRESENT,
I'M GONNA TAKE HER TO A SHOP

27:49.999 --> 27:52.071
THAT SELLS THE MOST EXQUISITE
ANTIQUE DOLLS

27:52.071 --> 27:54.373
AND LET HER PICK
WHICHEVER ONE SHE LIKES.

27:54.373 --> 27:57.977
WELL, SHE'S NOT GONNA LEAVE
HER PARTY TO GO BUY A DOLL.

27:57.977 --> 28:01.050
WELL, OF COURSE NOT. I'LL WAIT
ON THE PORCH TILL IT'S OVER.

28:01.050 --> 28:02.351
UH, LOOK, I'M SORRY,

28:02.351 --> 28:05.684
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
DRIVING OFF WITH MY DAUGHTER.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.187
WELL, YOU KNOW
SHE'LL BE SAFE WITH ME.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.790
BUT IF YOU'D
FEEL BETTER JOINING US...

28:10.790 --> 28:12.792
YOU SURE ARE
MAKING THIS HARD.

28:12.792 --> 28:15.795
I HAVE TRIED TO BE NICE, BUT I
AM RUNNING OUT OF POLITE HERE,

28:15.795 --> 28:18.127
SO I'M JUST GONNA SAY
KNOCK IT OFF.

28:18.127 --> 28:21.230
(scoffs) I'M SORRY.
KNOCK OFF WHAT?

28:21.230 --> 28:24.403
THIS WHOLE CREEPY, CLINGY
"I'M YOUR GRANDMA" ROUTINE.

28:24.403 --> 28:27.106
BUT I'VE COME TO FEEL LIKE
A GRANDMOTHER TO THE GIRLS.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.979
IN THREE DAYS.
 THAT'S THE CREEPY PART.

28:29.979 --> 28:32.141
WHAT A HURTFUL THING TO SAY,

28:32.141 --> 28:34.443
ESPECIALLY GIVEN HOW GENEROUS
I'VE BEEN TO YOUR FAMILY.

28:34.443 --> 28:36.145
YEAH, TOO GENEROUS.

28:36.145 --> 28:39.348
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE TRYING
TO BUY US OR SOMETHING.

28:39.348 --> 28:41.851
WELL, WE'RE NOT FOR SALE,
SO JUST BACK OFF!

28:41.851 --> 28:44.353
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

28:44.353 --> 28:46.395
YOU WICKED, UNGRATEFUL GIRL!

28:48.097 --> 28:50.099
YOU'RE NOT
THE FIRST GREEDY BITCH

28:50.099 --> 28:53.102
WHO'S TRIED TO BLEED ME DRY
AND THEN WASH HER HANDS OF ME.

28:53.102 --> 28:55.104
OKAY, WE'RE DONE HERE.
GOOD-BYE.

28:57.036 --> 29:00.269
AM I NOT MAKING MYSELF CLEAR?
GET OFF MY PROPERTY!

29:00.269 --> 29:02.111
(Carlos) GABY.

29:02.111 --> 29:03.773
WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:05.374 --> 29:07.877
I CAME TO BUY CELIA
A DOLL.

29:07.877 --> 29:11.080
I BELIEVE YOU'VE HEARD
GABY'S RESPONSE.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.282
VIRGINIA, PLEASE.

29:13.282 --> 29:15.184
ALLOW ME TO APOLOGIZE.

29:15.184 --> 29:17.326
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT.

29:19.388 --> 29:22.431
(car door opens and closes)

29:26.165 --> 29:27.536
THANK YOU...

29:27.536 --> 29:29.068
MM-HMM.

29:29.068 --> 29:31.140
FOR A WONDERFUL
THIRD DATE.

29:31.140 --> 29:32.271
OH.

29:32.271 --> 29:35.274
AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE
BACK ON BOARD WITH OUR PLAN.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.146
YEAH, I REALLY THINK

29:37.146 --> 29:39.148
I'M STARTING TO
GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT.

29:39.148 --> 29:40.810
MMM. OH, POP QUIZ!

29:40.810 --> 29:44.013
WHY DID KIM BEALE STOP
TALKING TO ME IN EIGHTH GRADE?

29:44.013 --> 29:47.316
WELL, YOU TOLD ERIN CONNORS
ABOUT HER NOSE JOB.
 RIGHT!

29:47.316 --> 29:49.288
WHAT TIME IS IT?

29:49.288 --> 29:50.920
UH, 10:48?

29:50.920 --> 29:52.391
NO. IT'S SEX TIME!

29:52.391 --> 29:54.393
(chuckles)

29:54.393 --> 29:57.396
(chuckles)
 HEY. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, SUSAN.

29:57.396 --> 29:58.868
WHAT?!
 STOP.

29:58.868 --> 30:01.370
WE'RE NOT HAVING SEX
TILL THE FOURTH DATE, REMEMBER?

30:01.370 --> 30:03.232
JACKSON, LOOK AT ME.

30:03.232 --> 30:04.874
I'M TIPSY. I'M HORNY.

30:04.874 --> 30:07.206
I'M EASIER THAN
A 5-YEAR-OLD'S HOMEWORK.

30:07.206 --> 30:08.878
HMM.

30:12.481 --> 30:14.583
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

30:21.250 --> 30:24.093
THE FOREHEAD?

30:25.094 --> 30:27.396
(scoffs)

30:27.396 --> 30:29.398
I HATE TO SAY ANYTHING, STAN,

30:29.398 --> 30:31.400
BUT YOU ARE PRESIDENT
OF THE COUNTRY CLUB.

30:31.400 --> 30:32.902
YOU NEED TO KNOW

30:32.902 --> 30:37.867
THAT THE WAY CARLOS TOUCHED ME
DURING MY LAST MASSAGE...

30:37.867 --> 30:41.340
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
IT WAS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.342
AND THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR

30:43.342 --> 30:46.475
IS A LIABILITY
THE CLUB CAN'T AFFORD.

30:50.019 --> 30:51.850
GOOD. (sighs)

30:51.850 --> 30:54.353
I APPRECIATE
YOUR TAKING CARE OF IT.

30:56.926 --> 30:59.858
(sets down telephone receiver)

30:59.858 --> 31:02.131
(telephone rings)

31:02.131 --> 31:05.134
HELLO?
 (woman) Uh, hello.
Is this Dr. Heller?

31:05.134 --> 31:08.137
SPEAKING. WHO'S CALLING?
 I'm Maggie Carr
at Hilltop Insurance.

31:08.137 --> 31:09.438
WE HAVE AN APPLICANT

31:09.438 --> 31:11.440
FOR A NEW TERM
LIFE INSURANCE POLICY,

31:11.440 --> 31:14.143
AND HE LISTS YOU
AS A PREVIOUS CARE PROVIDER.

31:14.143 --> 31:16.445
I WAS HOPING TO VERIFY
HIS MEDICAL HISTORY.

31:16.445 --> 31:18.277
THE NAME'S DAVE WILLIAMS.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.449
DAVE WILLIAMS?
I DON'T KNOW A DAVE WILLIAMS.

31:20.449 --> 31:22.982
WELL, SURE YOU DO.
YOU CALL HIM EVERY MONTH.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.985
(whispers) HOW WOULD MAGGIE
KNOW THAT?!
 UH, I'M GUESSING.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.987
WHO IS THIS?

31:27.987 --> 31:30.119
(normal voice)
UH, HI, DR. HELLER.

31:30.119 --> 31:33.262
I'M, UH, LINDSAY THORNE.
I'M MAGGIE'S SUPERVISOR.

31:33.262 --> 31:36.325
AND SHE'S CONFUSED
AND ABOUT TO GET FIRED.

31:36.325 --> 31:39.328
AND, UH, WE JUST NEED YOU
TO CONFIRM FOR OUR RECORDS

31:39.328 --> 31:41.630
THAT YOU'RE TREATING A MAN
NAMED DAVID WILLIAMS.

31:41.630 --> 31:45.074
WHAT IS
YOUR MEDICARE I.D. NUMBER?

31:45.074 --> 31:47.106
UM... I'M NOT SURE.

31:47.106 --> 31:50.439
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF
CONVERTING TO THE METRIC SYSTEM.

31:52.181 --> 31:54.283
I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS,

31:54.283 --> 31:57.286
BUT ARE YOU AWARE THAT
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS ILLEGAL?

31:57.286 --> 32:01.050
OKAY, LOOK. WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO GET SOME INFO ON THIS GUY.

32:01.050 --> 32:03.052
HE JUST MOVED TO FAIRVIEW,

32:03.052 --> 32:05.294
AND HE'S REALLY
CREEPING PEOPLE OUT.

32:05.294 --> 32:07.296
YOU'RE IN FAIRVIEW?

32:07.296 --> 32:09.598
YEAH. WHY? DOES THAT
MEAN SOMETHING TO YA?

32:13.662 --> 32:16.665
NO, I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
ALL THE INFO I NEED

32:16.665 --> 32:18.667
WHEN I CONTACT
THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES

32:18.667 --> 32:20.469
to let them know that--
 (beep)

32:23.612 --> 32:28.117
WELL, WE REALLY SCREWED
THE POOCH ON THAT ONE.

32:28.117 --> 32:30.119
YEAH, BACK TO
THE DRAWING BOARD.

32:30.119 --> 32:32.421
CAN I IRISH THAT UP
FOR YA?

32:32.421 --> 32:35.324
IT'S NOON SOMEWHERE.

32:35.324 --> 32:37.326
(door opens)

32:40.389 --> 32:43.462
(gasps) YOU GOT THE TAPE!
 HOW DID YOU MANAGE THAT?

32:43.462 --> 32:45.464
ORSON, WE DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.566
NO, YOU DON'T,
BUT IT'S KIND OF AMAZING

32:47.566 --> 32:50.569
WHAT YOU CAN GET A BUNCH OF
BIKERS TO DO FOR A CASE OF BEER.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.571
OH, MY.
 WELL, I BETTER DESTROY THIS.

32:52.571 --> 32:55.304
ACTUALLY, YOU MAY WANT
TO WATCH IT FIRST.

32:55.304 --> 32:57.706
WHY? I'M EMBARRASSED ENOUGH
AS IT IS.

32:57.706 --> 32:59.978
HUMOR ME. I'LL CUE IT UP.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.212
YOU WATCHED IT?!
 WELL, I HAD TO MAKE SURE
IT WAS THE RIGHT DISK.

33:03.212 --> 33:05.584
HERE, JUST WATCH
A LITTLE BIT.
 (sighs)

33:05.584 --> 33:07.756
(whirring)

33:07.756 --> 33:09.758
OH, DEAR GOD.
I CAN'T LOOK.

33:09.758 --> 33:12.061
REALLY, ANDREW.

33:14.323 --> 33:16.465
WAIT. BREE, THAT'S NOT US.

33:16.465 --> 33:18.467
WHAT? WELL, WHO IS IT THEN?

33:18.467 --> 33:20.769
WAIT, WAIT. HE FLIPS HER
IN JUST A SEC.

33:20.769 --> 33:23.402
THIS IS WHERE
IT GETS GOOD.

33:27.376 --> 33:28.737
KATHERINE!

33:28.737 --> 33:30.279
AND MIKE.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.484
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I'M--I'M NEVER EATING ANYTHING

33:35.484 --> 33:38.187
THAT COMES OUT
OF THAT KITCHEN AGAIN.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.231
(knock on door)

33:52.231 --> 33:53.532
(Susan) JACKSON?

33:59.338 --> 34:00.739
(sighs)

34:04.213 --> 34:05.344
HI.
 HI.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.045
(chuckles)

34:09.348 --> 34:11.049
(sighs)

34:14.083 --> 34:16.385
I AM DECLARING THIS

34:16.385 --> 34:18.387
OUR OFFICIAL FOURTH DATE,
OKAY?

34:18.387 --> 34:20.789
THE RULES
HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED,

34:20.789 --> 34:24.362
AND YOU MAY BEGIN
DISROBING...

34:24.362 --> 34:25.694
NOW.

34:25.694 --> 34:28.766
UH, I'M--I'M--I'M--I'M KIND OF
DOING SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.299
(laughs)

34:30.299 --> 34:33.402
OKAY, I JUST RAN
INTO YOUR HOUSE HALF-NAKED.

34:33.402 --> 34:36.375
THE ONLY THING
YOU SHOULD BE DOING IS ME.

34:36.375 --> 34:37.775
UH...

34:37.775 --> 34:40.279
WHAT IS ON YOUR FACE?

34:40.279 --> 34:42.080
IS THAT PAINT?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.552
ARE YOU PAINTING AGAIN?

34:43.552 --> 34:45.353
UH, Y-YEAH.

34:45.353 --> 34:48.317
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BLOCKED.

34:48.317 --> 34:49.788
I WAS, BUT, UH...

34:49.788 --> 34:52.491
(chuckles)
NOT HAVING SEX FOR A FEW DAYS

34:52.491 --> 34:55.594
KINDA GOT MY JUICES FLOWING
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.627
SO NOW I-I REALLY NEED
TO FINISH, SO--

34:58.627 --> 35:02.401
SO YOU'VE BROKEN THROUGH
YOUR CREATIVE LOGJAM?

35:02.401 --> 35:04.603
(giggles) CONGRATULATIONS!

35:04.603 --> 35:06.475
OOH, WHY NOT CELEBRATE

35:06.475 --> 35:08.437
BY RIPPING OFF MY CLOTHES
WITH YOUR TEETH?

35:08.437 --> 35:11.180
(chuckles)
 I... CAN'T.
I'M NOT FINISHED YET.

35:11.180 --> 35:13.612
HOW CLOSE ARE YOU?
'CAUSE I CAN WAIT.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.415
WAIT, WAIT, NO. NO, DON'T--
DON'T LOOK AT THAT... YET.

35:24.453 --> 35:26.725
THAT'S ME.

35:26.725 --> 35:30.159
YEAH. UH, IT'S...

35:30.159 --> 35:32.231
SUPPOSED TO BE.

35:34.833 --> 35:38.237
THAT LOOK ON MY FACE...

35:38.237 --> 35:40.339
I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE...

35:42.371 --> 35:46.375
IN THE MIRROR,
WHEN I'M FEELING...

35:49.748 --> 35:52.451
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT LOOK?

35:55.424 --> 35:57.426
I-I KNOW A LOT ABOUT YOU.

36:00.459 --> 36:06.695
I KNOW YOUR CHEEKS GET RED
WHEN PEOPLE SAY YOU'RE PRETTY.

36:06.695 --> 36:09.568
I KNOW THAT YOUR EYES
START TO TEAR UP

36:09.568 --> 36:11.840
WHENEVER YOU TALK ABOUT
YOUR GRANDFATHER.

36:14.703 --> 36:18.607
AND I KNOW THAT WHEN
YOU'RE REALLY SAD,

36:18.607 --> 36:23.512
YOU GET
THAT BEAUTIFUL, HAUNTED LOOK

36:23.512 --> 36:27.386
THAT YOU TRY TO SHAKE OFF
BEFORE ANYBODY CAN SEE IT.

36:30.659 --> 36:34.263
I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ME.

36:43.632 --> 36:47.406
WELL, I GUESS I SHOULD
LET YOU FINISH THIS.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.408
I'M SORT OF MISSING HANDS.

36:49.408 --> 36:50.739
MM.

36:50.739 --> 36:54.583
ACTUALLY, THAT IS ONE DETAIL
I COULD USE SOME HELP WITH.

36:54.583 --> 36:55.814
REALLY?

36:55.814 --> 36:58.747
UNLESS YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
POSING NAKED.

36:58.747 --> 37:01.620
OH. COME ON.

37:01.620 --> 37:04.323
I THINK YOU KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.761
HI.

37:12.761 --> 37:14.303
HELLO, KATHERINE.

37:14.303 --> 37:17.666
UM, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
THIS VIDEOTAPE...

37:17.666 --> 37:20.008
FROM OUR SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

37:20.008 --> 37:23.241
WE HAVE
A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA?

37:23.241 --> 37:26.275
YES, IN THE, UH,
TEST KITCHEN.

37:28.577 --> 37:30.449
(chuckles) OH, MY GOD.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.721
SO THAT MEANS YOU SAW
ME AND...

37:32.721 --> 37:35.654
MIKE. YES, INDEEDY.

37:35.654 --> 37:38.487
(laughing)
OH, I'M SO EMBARRASSED!

37:38.487 --> 37:40.989
OH, WHAT YOU MUST
THINK OF ME!

37:40.989 --> 37:43.992
LET'S NOT DWELL ON IT.
 OH! I MEAN,
HAVING SEX IN THE KITCHEN,

37:43.992 --> 37:45.664
WHERE FOOD'S PREPARED...

37:45.664 --> 37:48.337
WHAT KIND OF A DEMENTED SLUT
WOULD DO THAT?

37:48.337 --> 37:51.540
I SAID... (chuckles nervously)
LET'S NOT DWELL ON IT.

37:51.540 --> 37:54.603
(sighs)
THANKS FOR BRINGING IT BY.

37:54.603 --> 37:57.676
KATHERINE, I'M SORRY,
BUT I JUST HAVE TO ASK--

37:57.676 --> 38:01.550
ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
 MEANING WHAT?

38:01.550 --> 38:04.953
MEANING SUSAN IS YOUR
OLDEST FRIEND ON THIS STREET.

38:04.953 --> 38:08.917
SHE DIVORCED HIM, BREE,
AND SHE'S SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.

38:08.917 --> 38:10.919
WHY CAN'T MIKE DO THAT?

38:10.919 --> 38:13.992
BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR FRIEND,
AND WE'RE WOMEN.

38:13.992 --> 38:16.495
WE DON'T DO THAT
TO EACH OTHER.

38:18.727 --> 38:21.430
LOOK...

38:21.430 --> 38:24.333
I'VE BEEN ALONE
FOR FIVE YEARS.

38:24.333 --> 38:26.304
I'M FINALLY
IN A RELATIONSHIP,

38:26.304 --> 38:28.607
AND YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY?

38:28.607 --> 38:31.480
IS THAT WHAT I SAW ON THE TAPE--
A RELATIONSHIP?

38:31.480 --> 38:33.982
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

38:33.982 --> 38:35.484
ALL I KNOW IS...

38:35.484 --> 38:38.887
(whispers) I'M HAVING
THE TIME OF MY LIFE.

38:38.887 --> 38:41.590
(sighs deeply) FAIR ENOUGH.
BUT JUST BE CAREFUL,

38:41.590 --> 38:43.852
I MEAN,
THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED.

38:43.852 --> 38:46.555
I'D HATE TO SEE IT
END BADLY.

38:55.764 --> 38:57.606
(knock on door)

38:57.606 --> 39:01.039
HEY,
BREAKFAST'S ON THE TABLE.

39:06.515 --> 39:08.677
(sighs)

39:12.381 --> 39:14.923
PORTER, THIS WHOLE
HATING ME THING

39:14.923 --> 39:17.125
THAT YOU'VE GOT
GOING ON RIGHT NOW--

39:17.125 --> 39:20.128
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I GET
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.

39:20.128 --> 39:22.561
I DON'T HATE YOU.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.563
BUT ONE DAY,

39:24.563 --> 39:26.895
YOU ARE GONNA
MEET SOMEONE MORE...

39:26.895 --> 39:28.737
APPROPRIATE.

39:30.599 --> 39:34.503
SOMEONE WHO WANT THE SAME THINGS
THAT YOU DO OUT OF LIFE.

39:34.503 --> 39:38.376
THEN YOU ARE GONNA KNOW
WHAT REAL LOVE IS.

39:38.376 --> 39:41.480
AND WHEN YOU DO,
I HOPE YOU WILL FINALLY SEE

39:41.480 --> 39:43.512
WHERE I AM COMING FROM.

39:43.512 --> 39:46.485
(cell phone rings)

39:46.485 --> 39:47.986
HMM.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.488
(ring)

39:49.488 --> 39:51.159
YEAH?

39:51.159 --> 39:53.462
IT'S ME. CAN YOU TALK?

39:53.462 --> 39:56.895
HEY, GARY. I'M RUNNING KIND OF
LATE. CAN I CALL YOU LATER?

39:56.895 --> 39:58.597
JUST LISTEN.

39:58.597 --> 40:00.569
I CAN LEAVE TOWN SATURDAY.

40:00.569 --> 40:02.571
YOU HAVE THE MONEY, RIGHT?

40:02.571 --> 40:04.573
YEAH. NO PROBLEM.

40:04.573 --> 40:07.175
I LOVE YOU.

40:07.175 --> 40:09.177
(line disconnects)

40:09.177 --> 40:11.179
(sighs)

40:20.689 --> 40:23.522
I KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE COMING FROM, MOM.

40:25.594 --> 40:27.526
AND...

40:27.526 --> 40:30.028
I-I WANT
YOU AND DAD TO KNOW

40:30.028 --> 40:33.201
THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.

40:38.807 --> 40:40.709
GOOD.

40:40.709 --> 40:44.543
(sighs)
I'LL SEE YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

40:54.623 --> 40:57.085
DESIRE--

40:57.085 --> 41:01.660
IT'S AN EMOTION
DESIGNED TO LEAD US ASTRAY,

41:01.660 --> 41:07.165
PERSUADING THOSE WHO CRAVE LOVE
TO MAKE FOOLISH CHOICES...

41:09.598 --> 41:13.241
CAUSING THOSE
WHO YEARN FOR FAMILY

41:13.241 --> 41:17.205
TO ACT OUT IN ANGER...

41:18.677 --> 41:20.178
(doorbell rings)

41:20.178 --> 41:23.111
ALLOWING THOSE
WHO ARE LONELY...

41:25.483 --> 41:30.519
TO BEHAVE IN RECKLESS WAYS.

41:30.519 --> 41:34.492
AND WHEN THE PURSUIT
OF OUR HEART'S DESIRE

41:34.492 --> 41:36.625
BECOMES AN OBSESSION,

41:36.625 --> 41:39.127
THE BEST WE CAN HOPE FOR

41:39.127 --> 41:42.831
IS A CARING FRIEND
WILLING TO COME ALONG...

41:44.502 --> 41:48.176
HI. I'D LIKE TO BOOK
THE NEXT FLIGHT TO FAIRVIEW.

41:48.176 --> 41:50.679
AND STOP US.
