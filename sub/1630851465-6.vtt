00:10.927 --> 00:11.927
-Previously this season
on "Notorious Queens"...

00:11.928 --> 00:14.638
-I've been working on my line
for the next season,

00:14.639 --> 00:17.349
and I want to do, like,
a preseason fashion show.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.101
So, I've been designing
swimwear for three years,

00:19.102 --> 00:20.602
and I'm very passionate
about it.

00:20.603 --> 00:23.063
These ladies probably think
I'm just a pretty face

00:23.064 --> 00:26.233
and I have nothing to offer,
but I'm serious about what I do,

00:26.234 --> 00:27.943
and I want to show them
that there's more to me

00:27.944 --> 00:29.278
than meets the eye.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.446
-I heard you're writing a book.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.114
-Yeah, I wanted to write
about my life.

00:32.115 --> 00:36.076
I want to write my memoir
because I want people to learn

00:36.077 --> 00:38.078
that we all go through things,

00:38.079 --> 00:40.122
and we can all
have second chances.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.125
- Have you talked to your sons about it?
- No, I haven't.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.461
-Do you think the reason why
you haven't talked to them

00:45.462 --> 00:48.005
because you're afraid they're
gonna give you push-back?

00:48.006 --> 00:51.175
-[Sighs] My biggest fears
about writin' this book,

00:51.176 --> 00:53.969
it's how my family
are gonna look at me.

00:53.970 --> 00:57.222
And I'm afraid if I tell them,
they'll talk me out of it,

00:57.223 --> 01:00.559
and I'll end up
giving up on my dream.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.644
I'm just feeling
a little confused about,

01:02.645 --> 01:04.813
am I making the right
decision moving back,

01:04.814 --> 01:07.274
and is it gonna be
a comfortable transition for me?

01:07.275 --> 01:08.984
Which I'm sort of
struggling with.

01:08.985 --> 01:12.196
I know I struggle
with trust issues with people.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.614
I've been burned a few times.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.450
That pain that I remember
is still here,

01:16.451 --> 01:21.080
and I don't know if I can handle
being here in L.A. emotionally.

01:21.081 --> 01:25.417
-I have my friend Mehgan here,
and I know that you're

01:25.418 --> 01:28.212
gonna be able to find her
the man of her dreams.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.713
-Period, 'cause I got a list.

01:29.714 --> 01:33.426
-No one person ever gets
every single thing.

01:34.511 --> 01:35.594
-Where my man at?

01:35.595 --> 01:36.678
-Well, I will say,

01:36.679 --> 01:38.138
I've come across an obstacle.

01:38.139 --> 01:40.891
- "An obstacle"?
- He has a kid.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.435
-I guess I could give it a try.

01:43.436 --> 01:46.605
-My manager, she's like,
"La'Britney, I need you

01:46.606 --> 01:48.649
to have the song,
mix, and master.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.026
I need you to have
your listening party."

01:51.027 --> 01:53.445
She gave me three weeks
to do all of these things

01:53.446 --> 01:54.947
and pull all of this stuff
together.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.573
- That's a lot of pressure.
- Yeah.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.742
-If this don't go right
for that listening party,

01:58.743 --> 02:01.328
we not even gon' have
to worry about finding a place,

02:01.329 --> 02:03.747
'cause all the eggs
are in that basket.

02:03.748 --> 02:06.375
We need to make sure
that that is right.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.128
-If I have this listening party
and I don't do well,

02:09.129 --> 02:12.005
then I'll probably be
on a plane back to Detroit.

02:12.006 --> 02:15.968
-I was really surprised
that I'm the one that told you

02:15.969 --> 02:17.678
and La'Britney didn't.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.555
-Yeah. Why did you
have to tell me?

02:19.556 --> 02:23.767
I'm still in my feelings
about La'Britney not telling me

02:23.768 --> 02:25.853
that Stormey had a issue with
me.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.855
I need answers.
You should have told me.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.774
-I sensed the bullshit
when you walked in here.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.152
Everybody and they fuckin'
feelings for no reason.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.196

04:05.787 --> 04:08.580
Oh, man, y'all are
struggling today.

before a work-out.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.917

[Laughter]

04:11.918 --> 04:15.087
-My body, we had a long night.
A long night.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.713
I have, like, a slight headache.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.507

Touch of hangoverness.

And after the way everything
went down last night,

04:21.344 --> 04:23.428
I don't even know
if I feel like working out.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.097
- Ugh.
- Good work.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.848
- The struggle.
- Work.

Come on, little man!
They need some help out here!

04:28.559 --> 04:30.811
-Come on!
Chop, chop, chop, chop!

04:30.812 --> 04:33.188
- Moving like a old lady.
- Uh-oh.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.606
- Whew!
- The disrespect!

04:34.607 --> 04:36.358
- The disrespect.

I wanted to see his whole face,
but his eyebrows is perfect.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.419
Perfect skin tone.
- [Laughs]

04:55.420 --> 04:58.380
Girl, we shouldn't have been
partying like that last night.

04:58.381 --> 05:02.134
Normally, working out is, like,
a huge stress reliever,

05:02.135 --> 05:05.137
but right now,
this argument with Toni

05:05.138 --> 05:07.347
is still heavy on my mind.

05:07.348 --> 05:10.058
-I'm just saying that I thought
that you might have

05:10.059 --> 05:11.852
just came to say
something to me.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.186
-I'm not no little kid.
I'm not playing.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.604
-I'm not saying
you're a little kid.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.398
Don't say I said
you was a little kid.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.692
- I'm reminding you, though.
- You don't have to remind me about shit.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.902
-I'ma say what the fuck
I wanna say, sweetie.

05:20.903 --> 05:25.240
I'ma say what the fuck I wanna
say, so it is what it is.

05:25.241 --> 05:29.453
It is what the fuck
it iiiiiiiiiiiiis.

05:29.454 --> 05:30.787
Aaaaaah!

05:30.788 --> 05:33.832
- Well, I love this house, girl.
- Thank you. Yes, I love it, too.

05:33.833 --> 05:38.086
It was a little over my budget,
but it's worth it, though.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.921
-Yeah, the layout is beautiful.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.923
I love the space, the skylights.

05:41.924 --> 05:45.719
-Yeah, and I'll be able
to be comfortable, you know,

05:45.720 --> 05:49.598
and really be able to live
how I need to live, you know?

05:49.599 --> 05:52.601
But L.A. expensive.
- Yeah, it is.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.770
-Especially in comparison
to Detroit.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.397
The real estate
is like night and day.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.191
-Yeah, I've heard.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.817
But, girl, yeah,
about that party --

06:00.818 --> 06:03.653
Um, that conversation
kind of went left.

06:03.654 --> 06:04.905
-I came from a genuine place.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.114
Even when you came and told me

06:06.115 --> 06:07.991
that you weren't
talking down on her --

06:07.992 --> 06:09.326
- Exactly, exactly.
- It wasn't rude.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.661
You weren't disrespecting her
or anything.

06:11.662 --> 06:14.623
I know you and Toni
have a relationship.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.376
I'm sort of new to her,
but we did hang out a while,

06:17.377 --> 06:19.961
and I just felt like
I had caught a beat.

06:19.962 --> 06:22.631
And I feel like I want to
talk to her about it

06:22.632 --> 06:24.007
just to make sure that we don't

06:24.008 --> 06:25.592
have nothing there,
you know what I mean?

06:25.593 --> 06:27.010
- Yeah.
- And that it's clear.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.762
- She's pretty direct, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.223
-So if she felt
like that about you,

06:31.224 --> 06:32.766
she'll let you know.
- Yeah.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.601
-When I did tell you that
and you didn't --

06:34.602 --> 06:36.937
You wasn't messy about it,
you know what I mean?

06:36.938 --> 06:38.647
And I really appreciate that
from you.

06:38.648 --> 06:42.025
-Don't expect me to be
playing Mrs. Telephone

06:42.026 --> 06:43.568
in the middle of nobody drama.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.863
Like, I don't play these little
messy tea games, you know?

06:46.864 --> 06:48.698
Leave that shit
for the Hollywood hoes.

06:48.699 --> 06:51.118
-Well, obviously,
Mehgan is a prime example.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.994
[Laughter]
Yeah.

06:52.995 --> 06:55.205
-Okay, come on!

06:55.206 --> 06:56.373
I like that.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.583
I feel that Mehgan is messy
in her nature

06:58.584 --> 07:01.420
and how she probably was
in Toni's ear about,

07:01.421 --> 07:02.712
she can't trust La'Britney.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.089
It's messy. Hater shit.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.007
Mnh-mnh. You can see it
from a mile away.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.260
I mean, you know,
Ray Charles could see that.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.553
Girl, I ain't even got time

07:09.554 --> 07:11.972
to even be thinking
about that right now.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.224
I got the listening
party tomorrow

07:14.225 --> 07:15.892
and all the pressures of that,

07:15.893 --> 07:20.689
and this will be my first time
performing "Ducked Off" live.

07:20.690 --> 07:24.192
You know, I can't wait
to feel the energy...

07:24.193 --> 07:26.486
-Right
- from everybody in the room.

07:26.487 --> 07:27.696
-And I'm glad that I was able

07:27.697 --> 07:30.240
to give you the location
to do that.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.701
- I hope, Toni still comes.
- I hope that she do, too.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.744
-If she comes to the
listening party --

07:34.745 --> 07:36.455
I don't even know if I want
to even talk to her,

07:36.456 --> 07:40.417
'cause I'd hate for it to turn
into another yelling match.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.795
At the listening party,
I need to focus on my career.

07:43.796 --> 07:47.257
I don't have no time
to be wasting on petty fights.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.384
We're supposed to be friends.

07:49.385 --> 07:51.136
-I would hope that
it's not brought up there.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.567
Just a total vibe.
I'm feeling it.

08:47.568 --> 08:50.487
Like, makin' me even more
excited for the performance.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.030
-We have tables.
We have flowers.

08:52.031 --> 08:55.534
We got candles. We got scenery.
- It's beautiful.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.369
-We got you,
and we ready for the show.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.703
-And I'm ready to put on a show.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.665
I hope the people love the music.
- Mm-hmm.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.876
It's COVID, so we can only have
a few people safely,

09:04.877 --> 09:06.795
you know what I mean?
- And it's gon' be a good time.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.215
Good energy.
- I want you to have a really fun performance.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.133
You know, let it
just be you up there

09:12.134 --> 09:14.928
and just be without any worries
and just be sexy

09:14.929 --> 09:16.221
and just give it all you got.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.515
-And I'm gon' do just that.
[Laughter]

09:18.516 --> 09:22.477
So, usually, a listening party
is, like, a huge event

09:22.478 --> 09:24.104
where you invite out press.

09:24.105 --> 09:28.441
You will have your label
executives, other music artists.

09:28.442 --> 09:31.736
You know, you normally would go
all-out for a listening party.

09:31.737 --> 09:36.491
But because of COVID,
it's gon' be small and intimate.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.577
Just a couple of people
in attendance.

09:38.578 --> 09:42.747
So this is very different
than the usual.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.792
- La'Britney's here.
- Period. She has arriven.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.586
And we're at
the La'Britney show.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.087
I brought that part.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.547
[Laughter]

09:50.548 --> 09:53.383
-To finally be able to check
this goal off my list...

09:53.384 --> 09:55.844
This is Ashley.
- Nice to meet you.

09:55.845 --> 09:56.928
-Hey!

09:56.929 --> 10:00.181
-I feel accomplished,
and it's great.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.309
Hey! How are y'all?

10:02.310 --> 10:05.061
It's so pretty here.
- You look cute!

10:05.062 --> 10:06.396
-Thank you. How are you guys?

10:06.397 --> 10:08.315
- Oh.
- But, yeah.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.108
- Hi, friend!
- Hi, bae.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.444
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.070
Stormey did a great job,
though, right?

10:14.071 --> 10:15.947
-It's beautiful.
It is so pretty.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.907
And your outfit --
You look amazing.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.326
-Thank you so much for coming.

10:19.327 --> 10:22.579
I appreciate you for coming
out tonight -- for real.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.415
Mehgan's here,
but I'm looking around,

10:25.416 --> 10:26.916
and I don't see Toni.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.293
-What is Mehgan doing?

10:28.294 --> 10:30.712
-I'm over here trying to get
the vibes up, period.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.756
- Whoo!
- To vibes up.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.341
- Thank you.
- I did you -- you know.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.384
- Yeah, thank you.
- Got you a little --

10:36.385 --> 10:38.678
- Ooh, ooh.
- Cheers, ladies.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.221
Thank y'all for coming
out tonight.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.557
-Absolutely.
We're supporting you.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.435
-Kill it.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.020
- Uggghh.
- Love to see it.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.356
Love to see it!
- [Coughing]

10:49.357 --> 10:52.275
- Yeah, Stormey! Go hard!
- Oh!

10:52.276 --> 10:54.444
- So...
- Anybody talk to Toni?

10:54.445 --> 10:55.904
-[Sighs] I talked to Toni.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.739
She said that she was
gonna think about coming,

10:57.740 --> 11:00.241
so I think she gon' come.
- We just gon' stay optimistic.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.910
And know that
she's supporting you.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.496
Even if she's not here, she's
still always gonna support you.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.707
-Yeah. But I thank y'all
for coming out tonight.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.751
It's gon' be dope.
All right, y'all, I'll be back.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.671
I hate having
this issue with Toni

11:12.672 --> 11:14.673
just kind of lingering,
you know?

11:14.674 --> 11:18.218
But I can't dwell on it
too much right now,

11:18.219 --> 11:20.428
because this is a very
important night for me,

11:20.429 --> 11:21.763
and I have to focus.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.182
-Hey, ladies!
I want to introduce my friend.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.642
This is Charis.
- Hi, Charis!

11:25.643 --> 11:30.105
-This is Mehgan, Crystal,
Russell -- La'Britney's son.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.399
He's performing tonight.
- Oh, nice!

11:32.400 --> 11:34.859
-So, we're all here
to support La'Britney

11:34.860 --> 11:36.069
and her performance tonight.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.487
-I'm excited to check her out.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.072
Thanks for having me.
- Well, thank you for coming.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.990
You were important.
- Oh, well, hey.

11:40.991 --> 11:43.952
[Laughter]
- The music executive right here.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.912
West Coast legend.
- I am a veteran.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.414
I'm an OG, so --

11:47.415 --> 11:48.748
-So, Charis' name is gold.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.583
She's worked with so many
artists over the years.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.961
Charis' been in this game
for probably more than 30 years.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.004
She's knowledgeable
about publishing.

11:55.005 --> 11:58.466
She also has great connections
in the industry, as well.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.803
So if Charis likes La'Britney,
that would be huge for her.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.221
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.682
-Girl, it looks like
something's on your mind.

12:05.683 --> 12:09.269
-Yeah, I was just kind of bummed
because, like, I've been working

12:09.270 --> 12:10.812
so hard on my fashion show.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.857
And then, the set-up for
La'Britney's event is really nice,

12:13.858 --> 12:15.525
but when I walked in,
I was really surprised,

12:15.526 --> 12:17.360
because I thought
it was gonna be a party --

12:17.361 --> 12:19.404
Like, a listening party,

12:19.405 --> 12:21.531
With all this shit with COVID...

12:21.532 --> 12:24.033
-Yeah, we just couldn't have
that many people here.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.452
-Yeah. I did this
big casting call,

12:25.453 --> 12:26.703
and the girls were amazing.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.371
So beautiful.
- Aww, I'm sorry.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.749
- And now, I'm bummed,
because it's like, now what?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.584
-Yeah. I mean, shit.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.920
- So, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
- Yeah.

12:35.921 --> 12:39.215
-Like, I was thinking
big runway.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.301
Like, balloons.

12:41.302 --> 12:45.180
Hundreds of people,
chairs, decorations, a cake.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.223
I'm not gon' be able to do this.

-Toni invited me over today

17:38.057 --> 17:40.933
to discuss our issue
at the pole dance party.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.894
Even though she came out
and supported me

17:42.895 --> 17:44.812
at my listening party,
we still have to

17:44.813 --> 17:47.356
have a conversation
to lay our issues to rest.

17:47.357 --> 17:50.109
Thank you so much for showing up
to my listening party.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.903
I really appreciated seeing you,

17:51.904 --> 17:55.698
especially, you know,
having unresolved issues.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.742
-Right. I'm glad
you did come over,

17:57.743 --> 17:59.285
'cause I wanted to discuss that.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.329
- Yeah. Me, too.
- It got a little heated.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.623
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't mean for it to get that heated,

18:03.624 --> 18:05.833
but it was like,
you started cussing.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.669
You started moving your hands,
and to me, that was like,

18:08.670 --> 18:09.962
"Well, why is she
doing all this?"

18:09.963 --> 18:11.506
'Cause you know
what that means to us.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.550
That mean, "Shoot, it's time
to fight or something."

18:14.551 --> 18:16.260
You know, and I ain't
wantin' to do that.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.764
-You know, I felt like your
approach, it was kind of shady,

18:19.765 --> 18:22.433
and it reminded me
of, like, another time

18:22.434 --> 18:25.061
when we kind of had
a little -- you know.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.063
-And then, you brought that up,
and I was like --

18:27.064 --> 18:28.272
-And that's why, though.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.358
So, just like when we was
in Detroit, you feel me?

18:30.359 --> 18:33.486
And you ran into me, and your little
smartass comment you made to me.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.238
-That wasn't
motherfucking smart.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.322
How smart was it?

18:36.323 --> 18:38.199
-It was very smart.
It was very smart.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.494
-And you didn't say shit then,
so don't say shit now!

18:41.495 --> 18:43.204
Don't say shit now!

18:43.205 --> 18:44.580
I didn't want you
to bring that up

18:44.581 --> 18:46.207
because we'd kind of
resolved that.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.251
-We did, but the energy

18:48.252 --> 18:50.545
and then the way you were
handling the situation

18:50.546 --> 18:52.004
reminded me of that time, too.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.465
'Cause even that time,
I felt like --

18:54.466 --> 18:56.050
I wish, in that moment,

18:56.051 --> 18:58.511
you would have
approached me differently.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.389
You know, instead of
her calling me

19:01.390 --> 19:02.849
or pulling me to the side like,

19:02.850 --> 19:04.392
"Yo, La'Britney,
I want to talk to you,"

19:04.393 --> 19:08.020
she decided to kind of
call me out in front of people

19:08.021 --> 19:10.523
with this snobby,
snotty attitude,

19:10.524 --> 19:11.983
and I just didn't like that.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.693
You could have pulled me to the side.
- Right.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.737
-You know, I can understand
where you coming from,

19:16.738 --> 19:20.491
but it's shade, and it's catty,
and stuff like that.

19:20.492 --> 19:23.286
At the pole dance party,
you were coming at me like --

19:23.287 --> 19:25.329
I feel like you was
questioning my loyalty

19:25.330 --> 19:26.664
and my character as a woman.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.249
You feelin' me?
- And I was questioning.

19:28.250 --> 19:32.253
Because, like I said,
we both from the same area.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.422
You know, we were surrounded
by the same people.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.174
So you know how
we dip out, you know?

19:36.175 --> 19:40.595
The whole BMF thing --
We carry that word.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.513
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we tight.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.515
Loyalty is important to me.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.350
I'm a part of an organization

19:46.351 --> 19:49.228
where we hold loyalty
at a high standard.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.355
We base our relationships on it.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.690
We took an oath on it.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.526
And La'Britney
coming from Detroit,

19:55.527 --> 19:57.987
she knows what
those letters mean,

19:57.988 --> 19:59.947
so she should know
how we should roll.

19:59.948 --> 20:03.075
-That's just all a part
of growing with one another.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.827
-Right, 'cause we
out here together,

20:04.828 --> 20:08.372
and I'm supposed to embrace
you and make sure you good

20:08.373 --> 20:10.249
instead of, you know, attacking.

20:10.250 --> 20:14.003
And I'm gon' always show the
utmost respect to you, you know?

20:14.004 --> 20:16.839
- Yeah.
- And, you know, I apologize.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.216
I didn't ever mean to be

20:18.217 --> 20:20.176
disrespectful towards you,
you know?

20:20.177 --> 20:23.262
I appreciate having
a woman like you.

20:23.263 --> 20:26.432
I've never really had
a woman like you

20:26.433 --> 20:28.309
out here with me,
you know what I'm sayin'?

20:28.310 --> 20:30.269
-Thank you.
-My mom at home. My sister at home.

20:30.270 --> 20:33.105
I admire a lot of the things
that you have going on --

20:33.106 --> 20:34.607
Your non-profit, your book.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.943
Like, you are
a really strong woman.

20:36.944 --> 20:40.696
- Thank you.
- Like, respect -- for real.

20:40.697 --> 20:44.450
-Hearing La'Britney saying
that she looks up to me,

20:44.451 --> 20:45.701
it's really touching.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.579
It's making me realize
that I need to do better

20:48.580 --> 20:50.748
and I need to lead by example.

20:50.749 --> 20:54.669
I want her to understand
that we can have differences,

20:54.670 --> 20:58.089
but no matter what,
we have to respect one another.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.259
-I don't want us to go that way
with each other, okay?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.678
-'Cause I wanna push this.
I want to push you.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.304
I want to see you grow.

21:05.305 --> 21:08.808
I'm telling you,
you threw down at your show.

21:08.809 --> 21:11.227
I was like, "Oh, I can
bump this in the car.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.436
I can't wait to hear it.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.063
I can't wait to help promote it,

21:14.064 --> 21:16.899
so anything you need me to do,
I'm here for you.

21:16.900 --> 21:21.195
-Knowing that Toni just wants
to see me win, I'm like,

21:21.196 --> 21:22.613
"Okay, you know what?

21:22.614 --> 21:24.490
I don't have to be so guarded.

21:24.491 --> 21:25.950
I can let my guard down."

21:25.951 --> 21:29.412
So I'm glad that I was able to
have this conversation with Toni

21:29.413 --> 21:33.291
and just learn her more
and see that she really does

21:33.292 --> 21:35.293
have my best interests at heart.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.587
So, how are things
coming along with the book?

21:38.588 --> 21:40.756
-I've finished
the first few chapters.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.758
- Okay, congratulations.
- Oough. Thank you.

21:42.759 --> 21:46.178
- How you feel about it?
- My emotions are everywhere.

21:46.179 --> 21:48.014
-Has Terry read the book yet?

21:48.015 --> 21:51.017
-I sent him
the first few chapters,

21:51.018 --> 21:53.811
but I haven't had
a response yet.

21:53.812 --> 21:57.773
I mean, we talk, but he's, like,
talking all around it.

21:57.774 --> 22:02.028
Like, I know he's read it,
but I don't...

22:02.029 --> 22:04.447
- Know how he feels about it.
- Yeah.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.198
And so, I'm just waiting --

22:06.199 --> 22:08.534
When he's ready
to talk about it.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.952
Yeah, I'm not gon' push it.

22:09.953 --> 22:13.622
A little bit at a time
and see what happens.

22:13.623 --> 22:15.958
- Both: Yeah.
- I'm super nervous.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.753
Is Terry gonna tell me
not to write it?

22:18.754 --> 22:20.546
Is he gonna like it?

22:20.547 --> 22:22.631
If he tells me
not to write my book,

22:22.632 --> 22:26.510
there's gonna be a lot of
talking about this situation.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.263
I don't know.
I just don't know.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.265
But, girl, I know
you've got things to do,

22:31.266 --> 22:33.309

- Yes. Me, too.

- I don't know, girl.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.886
I'm thinking about
canceling this fashion show.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.971
-Oh, you can't do that. But why?

23:10.972 --> 23:12.556
-Because I wanted
a fashion show.

do a big fashion show

23:22.984 --> 23:24.944

because of COVID,

get a couple of emails

24:09.781 --> 24:12.324
from a few retailers, so maybe
I could just put together, like,
