Hey, you know, you're not
supposed to buy your own
birthday breakfast.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.930
That's against the rules.
(CHUCKLES)
Well, I hate birthdays.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.640
But I love you though.
Yeah.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.402
So you want some?

01:54.531 --> 01:57.238
Yeah, when | get out
of the shower, babe.
I wasn't talking about that.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.904
Oh, no? That's not
what you're talking about?
No.

02:00.037 --> 02:03.029
(CHUCKLING)
Happy birthday to me.
Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.419
That's a hot outfit.
(SCOFFS)

02:11.506 --> 02:12.871
I need to look professional.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.048
Relax, okay?
Everyone there loves you.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.751
(GROANS) Ijust...
I don't know if I can do this.

02:18.513 --> 02:21.300
Every manager at our company
has a college degree.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.759
Yeah, well, I'd argue
that 15 years' experience

02:24.853 --> 02:27.139
is worth, what, 10 degrees?

02:28.065 --> 02:29.475
Not to these people.
Oh.

02:30.859 --> 02:31.848
But thank you.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.154
I need you today, abuela.

02:45.332 --> 02:48.540
Hey, just remember that
they need you more than
you need them, okay?

02:48.627 --> 02:50.913
I'm just trying
to stay focused.
Yeah.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.369
Keep my eye on the ball.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.914
Did you just
sports metaphor me?
Oh, God.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.754
Hey, you know, just take it
one game at a time.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.209
What if Weiskopf
doesn't like me?

02:59.304 --> 03:01.420
Well, it's a game of inches.
You gotta give him 110%.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.595
I'm ignoring you, okay?

03:02.683 --> 03:05.220
Do you like, "It's an honor
to meet you, Mr. Weiskopf"?

03:05.310 --> 03:06.425
Or is that...
Too ass-kissy.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.184
Yeah, okay.
(MUTTERS)

03:09.189 --> 03:10.474
I have to get this, Trey.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.680
Hey, look.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.400
The only thing
with a prayer of stopping you

03:15.487 --> 03:16.522
is you.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.072
I'm gonna be late.
Okay.

I'm not a piece of meat...

It's a pleasure, Mr. Weiskopf,
to show you what we've been
doing at Value Shop 151.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.229
The pleasure is ours.
Take note, Arthur.

03:53.316 --> 03:57.025
Ozone Park Value Shop
outsells its nearest
competition twice over.

03:57.529 --> 03:58.735
Let me show you why.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.321
Welcome to our online store.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.982
My best friend,
Joan Volpentesta,
fellow employee,

04:04.077 --> 04:06.864
sends her son Dilly
into the store
with his cell phone

04:06.955 --> 04:10.163
to hold up every single cut of
sirloin for her beef braciole.

04:10.667 --> 04:11.656
And that's when it hit me.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.917
It's a live feed. Interesting.
Yes.

04:14.004 --> 04:17.370
From home, our subscribers can
pick a certain cut of salmon,

04:17.466 --> 04:20.378
the third lemon from the back,
anything they want.

04:20.469 --> 04:23.586
They shop before noon,
we deliver by 6:00,
20-mile radius.

Expands our volume.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.505
And expands
our profits nicely.

And this is
where it all began.

Yes. This was all Maya's idea.

04:43.158 --> 04:46.275
and l was sharing my woes
with some other moms,

04:46.369 --> 04:49.953
when Maya smartly suggested
that we start a weekly
bitch fest...

Monday Moms, or dads.

what to say,

extremely fortunate

to have you
as a first lieutenant.

So, I'm gonna leave you alone
to get to know
each other better.

can I have a minute?

05:23.698 --> 05:25.484
You can have two.
Thank you.

for weeks.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.659
And you did great.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.532
Look, I've put 15 years
of my life into this store.

05:36.127 --> 05:39.119
And after becoming
assistant manager
six years ago,

05:39.381 --> 05:41.588
sales have increased
at a record pace.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.211
Look, I mean no disrespect,
but...

05:45.053 --> 05:47.385
What do you know
about this store
or the people who shop here?

05:47.472 --> 05:49.087
I specialize
in team building.

go to college, dear?

06:03.280 --> 06:04.895
I respect that. I do.

06:05.240 --> 06:09.199
But we have
minimum job requirements
in place for a reason.

06:09.411 --> 06:10.696
And what is that reason?

06:10.787 --> 06:14.746
I want you to know how much
we value you and your loyalty.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.998
You would think
management would want someone
from sales in that position.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.579
Okay, perspective.

06:22.924 --> 06:26.792
You have a great boyfriend,
Trey, who is ring-shopping

06:28.179 --> 06:29.464
Shit!

06:31.516 --> 06:32.722
Why would you tell me that?
Okay.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.470
I said "shit,"
so obviously I know...

06:34.561 --> 06:35.926
Anyway, it shouldn't be
a surprise.

You guys have been together
for five years.

because...

this conversation right now.

say this nicely?

How about this?

get knocked up.

the ones where King...

11:58.134 --> 12:00.546
Ms. Davilla, a minute.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.388
Look, I'm aware
that you wanted this position.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.224
And what's more, I sincerely
believe that you deserved it.

Your ideas, while rough,
still have merit.

I mean... (SCOFFS)
What's rough about them?

12:17.779 --> 12:20.191
But when you roll your eyes,
Ms. Davilla,

12:20.573 --> 12:24.691
you trivialize a team-building
exercise, and that divides us.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.651
You‘re my right hand.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.112
We're all at the same table.
Yeah?

12:30.291 --> 12:34.660
As I was saying,
I'd like us to think
of ourselves as knights,

12:34.754 --> 12:37.871

12:41.386 --> 12:44.719
you will be
our knight of legumes.

12:44.931 --> 12:48.640
And, Sir Alex Gibbian,
you are the marquis of meat.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.178
What the hell is a legume?

you are the knight

12:53.940 --> 12:55.225

12:55.566 --> 12:56.726
I'm menopausal.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.191
Apparently, I deserve this.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.940
Hey, uh, some lady
called for you.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.521
Um, something about
a job interview from F&C.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.073
Franklin and Clarke?
I don't know.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.152
The ones who make
half the stuff on aisle seven,
eight, and 11.

13:09.247 --> 13:10.282
Oh. Okay.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.576
I didn't apply
for a job there.

13:13.668 --> 13:16.660
Uh, all right, you pulled it
out of me. You remember
your birthday wish?

13:18.006 --> 13:19.041
What? Dilly?

13:19.132 --> 13:23.125
He used your legal name,
don't worry. He put you up
for some jobs. He did.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.335
I didn't ask him to.
Okay, all right.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.012
Well, you know what,
you can either grow some balls

13:28.099 --> 13:31.216
or spend the rest of your life
with Lord Bag-o'-Dicks.

13:31.644 --> 13:35.011
And if customer service
comes in and they wanna fight.
Here, let's fight.

it's under Maria Vargas.
I got a call from...

14:34.248 --> 14:36.034
Your interview is
on the 59th floor.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.715
Hi. I'm...
Ms. Vargas.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.300
Yes, he‘s been expecting you.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.094
He?

14:59.440 --> 15:00.725
Ms. Vargas is here.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.099
Hi.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.064
I'm Anderson Clarke.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.688
Clarke, as in
Franklin & Clarke?
(CHUCKLES)

15:08.783 --> 15:10.899
Oh, my grandfather wanted it
to be Clarke & Franklin,

15:10.993 --> 15:12.574
but he lost the coin toss.

Well, then call me Anderson.

You come from sales?

15:31.222 --> 15:32.211
Fifteen years.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.430
I'm sorry,
what is this position for?

15:35.518 --> 15:39.511
I've often thought that sales
should have a greater voice
in product development.

15:39.856 --> 15:40.845
I couldn't agree more.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.726
I mean, the market's
only getting more competitive.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.475
And consumers are
only getting smarter.
Oh, yes, they are.

you had a meeting.

Well, indirectly. (CHUCKLES)

16:05.089 --> 16:06.875
So, what are you guys
talking about?

16:07.049 --> 16:09.631
I was thinking of
bringing Maya on
for a consultancy.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.042
You were?

16:11.345 --> 16:12.334
ZOE: Wow.

16:13.139 --> 16:16.552
Uh, you must have
a lot of experience
in product development.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.384
Oh, I'm sure
she's well-versed in
the efficacy of our products.

16:19.562 --> 16:20.893

off the top of my head, um...

Mountain Shampoo is excellent,

16:35.828 --> 16:38.114
although I only stock
the, uh, regular version.

16:38.206 --> 16:41.744
Um, your men's shaving gel
really moves.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.457
But your skin care line is...

16:43.920 --> 16:45.080

16:46.839 --> 16:48.204
A little behind
the competition.

ANDERSON: Can you
be more specific?

16:49.967 --> 16:52.629
MAYA: Well, you launched
your avocado jojoba line
last spring,

16:52.887 --> 16:55.378
and we only sold 1,353 units,

16:55.473 --> 16:57.930
which is about 70%
under the normal range.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.766
And that‘s just off the top
of your head?
Can I talk to you in private?

17:01.020 --> 17:03.306
Just a second.
Why do you think
they didn't sell, Maya?

17:03.523 --> 17:04.854

isn't really organic.

17:16.410 --> 17:20.323
I realize that my credentials
aren't typically what...

philanthropy, all the work
with the Peace Corps.

And of course, you have got to
see her Facebook page.

My Facebook page?

for Kilimanjaro for months.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.846
Is that right?

17:39.100 --> 17:41.386
Well, Zoe? What do you think?

17:41.686 --> 17:42.971
I think I've seen enough.

17:44.272 --> 17:45.557
Thank you for coming in, Maya.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.170
She doesn't look happy.
I'm not happy.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.581
They didn't like you?

18:13.676 --> 18:15.507
No, they thought
I was very accomplished,

18:15.595 --> 18:19.133
given my MBA
and my stint
in the Peace Corps.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.679
Who can blame them?

for Maya? And do not lie.

Yes.

some credit.

use your porn name,

legal name anymore, so...

because it's your real name.

I've got everything.
I've got your school records,
employment history.

so it's basically real.

their entire skin care line.

to see if you were
a straight shooter.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.861
Uh, what cycle?
It was men's grooming,

29:01.949 --> 29:04.440
but they switched it to
skin care at the last second.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.028

29:06.119 --> 29:09.111

to sound like anything
but constructive advice...

29:09.289 --> 29:11.871
We've never had a consultant
in Development before,

29:11.959 --> 29:14.871
so they‘re gonna be
looking for any excuse
to tear you apart.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.737
Maya Vargas is an extremely
accomplished consultant,

30:32.831 --> 30:36.415
and the new skin care
direction was partially
inspired by her feedback.

30:36.626 --> 30:37.832
Maya?

30:41.840 --> 30:43.171
Sir, lthink
it's a great idea.

30:43.258 --> 30:46.170
End of quarter is aggressive,
but, uh, I think we're up
to the challenge.

30:46.261 --> 30:47.421
Excellent. Thank you, Ron.

30:47.596 --> 30:49.006
We'll start brainstorming.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.884
Though it might be helpful
to hear Maya's game plan.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.090
Mmm.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.346
Sorry?
ZOE: Yes.

30:55.479 --> 30:59.688
Uh, Maya, please tell everyone
where you think the existing
skin care line falls short.

31:01.735 --> 31:02.941
Okay.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.267
Um...

31:06.114 --> 31:07.479
Respectfully, uh...

31:09.409 --> 31:12.776
F&C was skewered when
they tried to convince people
that Notralis

31:12.871 --> 31:15.954
was some new hair growth
product, when basically,
it was repackaged shampoo.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.621
They felt scammed.
So to repeat that pattern...

31:19.711 --> 31:20.746
It's not the same.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.290
You can't say "all natural"
on the front of a bottle,

31:23.382 --> 31:26.340
and then have a whole list
of chemicals on the back.

31:26.468 --> 31:29.301
All comfortably
within FDA guidelines.

31:29.596 --> 31:33.134
People don't want to
"probably not" get cancer
from a skin cream.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.887
That's ridiculous.
Launching an entirely new
product line

31:35.977 --> 31:38.093
is almost triple the cost
of evolving an existing one.

31:38.188 --> 31:40.474
I think people...
Guys, we're all
on the same team here.

31:40.565 --> 31:41.725

31:42.150 --> 31:43.890
ZOE: You know what?
Maybe we shouldn't be.

31:44.152 --> 31:47.485
How about this?
Ron and I will
thread the needle

31:47.572 --> 31:50.780
at profitably organic-ifying
the current line.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.408

can cook up something new.

You don't really, what?

35:09.482 --> 35:13.771
You know how it is.

that you guys broke up,

What do you mean?
What do you expect?
You never told him the truth.

35:24.497 --> 35:27.330
What? Me telling him the truth
was suddenly gonna make
everything okay?

35:27.417 --> 35:31.285
No, you're right.
It's better to lug your past
around like a cross.

I don't wanna do that.

As your friend, I'm gonna take
these off your hands.
Thank you.

Don‘t you dare.
No, I'm gonna take 'em,

'cause you don't seem to be
appreciative of it.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.664
So, I'm gonna go. Okay.
No.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.666
And then I'm gonna take this.
Okay. It's a two-parter.

we need to do, outline a goal
for our product.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.209
Has to be 100% organic.

37:03.304 --> 37:08.469
It has to be profitable.
It has to fill a hole
in the marketplace.

a wow factor.

really want?

37:21.531 --> 37:22.737
To be loved.

All we need to do
is invent a product

37:25.994 --> 37:30.488
that makes people feel
young, thin, lovable, and

37:31.082 --> 37:32.288

have Research put together
a data package

Looking at the sell-throughs,
the rates of return.

I mean, if we're gonna
find a hole in the market,

then we have to find
the hole in the market.

44:51.189 --> 44:52.554
WOMAN: (ON PHONE)
Edward Taylor's office.

44:52.648 --> 44:53.683
Yes, is Mr. Taylor in?

44:53.774 --> 44:56.186
l have a quick question
about a reference
on a former employee.

44:56.611 --> 44:59.648
Mr. Taylor is away
until the 21st.
I can have him return.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.234
I'd appreciate that,
thank you.

45:02.325 --> 45:05.408
I'm really proud
just to be here with them.
Be a part of it, you know?

45:05.494 --> 45:07.610
(ALL CHEERING)

45:07.830 --> 45:09.070
(LAUGHING)

45:10.416 --> 45:12.577
(WHOOPS)
That was really cold!

45:21.177 --> 45:23.133
Hello. What's this?

45:23.221 --> 45:24.210
Research.

45:25.181 --> 45:26.421
You did all this
in the field?

45:26.515 --> 45:30.508
God, no. We have wasted six
weeks talking to whackadoos
from store to store.

45:30.603 --> 45:32.059
I ordered this
from downstairs.

45:32.688 --> 45:35.725
That's not how
we're doing this.
And yet, it's how it's done.

45:35.942 --> 45:40.106
Wow. Uh, 120,000 responses,
but no real consensus.

45:40.196 --> 45:42.232
Which is exactly my point.
People are idiots.

45:42.323 --> 45:44.689
They don't know
what they want. They want us
to tell them what they want,

45:44.825 --> 45:47.237
so they can pick
the prettiest bottle
and get on with their lives.

45:47.995 --> 45:50.111
Maya, could I talk to you
for a second?

45:50.915 --> 45:52.371
Um, yeah.

45:56.837 --> 46:00.170
So, we are looking at
taking on a new
Chinese distributor.

46:00.633 --> 46:03.875
Their CEO is in town
and wants to meet me and Ron
for dinner this Thursday.

46:04.262 --> 46:06.753
His English is sketchy
at best.

46:06.847 --> 46:10.180
Dad thought
you could help us out.

46:10.768 --> 46:11.757
Okay.

46:12.228 --> 46:14.264
Our go-to translator
is on his honeymoon,

46:14.355 --> 46:18.018
and the only employee we have
who speaks Mandarin is...

46:19.944 --> 46:21.150
Me?
Yeah.

46:23.572 --> 46:25.733
Okay. Great.
Great.

46:25.825 --> 46:27.565
Thursday. Okay.
Yep.

46:29.036 --> 46:31.652
Oh, my God!
You are so butt-fricked.

46:31.747 --> 46:33.658
It's not funny, Joan.
Oh, it is.

46:33.749 --> 46:35.990
I almost killed people
in a boat race.

46:36.085 --> 46:38.667
Now I'm gonna murder Mandarin.
I don't speak Chinese.

46:38.963 --> 46:42.205
All right, so you do
a lot of nodding. I mean,
men don't listen to us anyway.

46:42.300 --> 46:43.335
I'm serious.

46:45.011 --> 46:46.342
Ijust got an idea.

46:46.762 --> 46:48.593
Our cat's veterinarian.

46:48.681 --> 46:51.172
He's the nicest guy
in the world,
and he speaks Mandarin.

46:51.267 --> 46:52.552
And how does that help me?

46:52.643 --> 46:55.806
Well, if this works,
you owe me big time.

46:56.188 --> 46:57.598
(SPEAKING MAN DARIN)

47:17.918 --> 47:21.831
(IN ENGLISH) Okay, he's asking
you if you have ever traveled
extensively in China.

47:22.506 --> 47:23.495
You say...

47:24.967 --> 47:26.127
(SPEAKING MAN DARIN)

47:29.680 --> 47:30.669
(IN ENGLISH) You say...

47:34.060 --> 47:35.721

(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
(WHINES)

47:44.612 --> 47:46.568
(IN ENGLISH)
But I feel so bad

47:46.655 --> 47:48.361
leaving everybody else
out of the conversation.

47:48.449 --> 47:51.361
I'm sure that your English
is much better
than my Mandarin.

47:51.827 --> 47:53.783
I suspect it might be.

47:53.871 --> 47:55.532
We would love
to schedule a tour

47:55.623 --> 47:58.365
for you and your colleagues
to visit our facilities
firsthand.

47:58.459 --> 48:00.825
But, of course,
we would have to wait
for the deal to be closed

48:00.920 --> 48:02.660
due to the proprietary nature
of R&D.

48:02.755 --> 48:05.667
As long as there is a signed
nondisclosure agreement,

48:05.758 --> 48:08.465
I feel perfectly comfortable
allowing Mr. Jiang to tour.

48:08.552 --> 48:11.760
You may not be aware, Zoe,
but that directly contradicts
company policy.

48:11.889 --> 48:14.130
(CLEARS THROAT)
But I'm sure
Mr. Jiang can understand that.

48:17.603 --> 48:19.434
(SPEAKING MAN DARIN)

48:22.066 --> 48:23.055
Oh...

48:23.150 --> 48:24.390
(SPEAKING MAN DARIN)

48:28.155 --> 48:29.770
(ALL LAUGHING)

48:34.161 --> 48:35.742
(IN ENGLISH) I like her.

48:36.288 --> 48:37.778
And thank you, Zoe.

48:37.873 --> 48:40.956
I will gladly sign the NDA
to tour your facilities.

48:41.836 --> 48:44.077
ZOE: Thank you. That actually
worked out great.

48:44.171 --> 48:45.707
Ron didn't seem too happy.

48:45.798 --> 48:48.710
Well, Ron is
one of the reasons
I hate this job sometimes.

48:49.885 --> 48:51.876
So, how is
your project coming?

48:52.638 --> 48:53.673
Honestly?

48:54.473 --> 48:56.805
Slow. Should have kept
my big mouth shut.
(SCOFFS)

48:56.892 --> 48:59.679
Yeah. 100% organic is tough.

49:00.020 --> 49:01.385
I took a run at it
a few years ago.

49:05.234 --> 49:09.819
You know,
I still have some research
over at my dad's place.

49:09.905 --> 49:11.816
If you don't mind
helping me search for it,

49:11.907 --> 49:13.989
it might save you
a few headaches.

49:15.661 --> 49:17.902
Thanks. I mean,
that would be really helpful.

49:18.205 --> 49:21.538
Yeah, well, it's the least
I can do for you
making Ron look like a dick.

49:21.834 --> 49:22.914
(CHUCKLES)

49:23.544 --> 49:24.784
I'll see you.

49:30.301 --> 49:33.134
What's up, Pops?
I'm heading out to meet Maya
over at the apartment.

49:33.262 --> 49:35.048
Actually, that's why
I wanted to see you.

49:35.222 --> 49:37.178
Uh-oh. Sounds serious.
(CHUCKLES)

49:37.266 --> 49:38.847
Would you close the door,
sweetheart?

49:41.061 --> 49:42.050
Okay.

49:48.319 --> 49:49.479
(INAUDIBLE)

50:05.711 --> 50:06.700
Well, when's he moving?

50:06.795 --> 50:08.080
Uh, next month.

50:08.172 --> 50:10.788
My apartment's so tiny,
he lets me keep
a lot of myjunk here.

50:12.676 --> 50:16.168
This place is huge.
You grew up here?

50:17.014 --> 50:18.220
Most of my life.

50:20.768 --> 50:22.474
MAYA: Wow.
(ZOE CHUCKLES)

50:22.561 --> 50:23.971
ZOE: Dad likes
to collect them.

50:28.734 --> 50:29.769
Is that your mom?

50:30.152 --> 50:31.141
Mmm-hmm.

50:31.237 --> 50:32.226
Pretty.

50:35.115 --> 50:36.776
She was blonde?
Yeah.

50:37.785 --> 50:38.991
l was adopted.

50:40.704 --> 50:42.285
Let‘s get you that research.

50:47.294 --> 50:48.659
Sorry about the mess.

50:48.754 --> 50:50.494
Dad saved everything.

50:51.048 --> 50:53.460
And I mean everything.
(CHUCKLES)

50:53.592 --> 50:56.254
Oh, my goodness.
Could you be any cuter?

50:56.470 --> 50:57.630
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

50:59.139 --> 51:00.800
This is all the early stuff.

51:02.309 --> 51:04.516
Yeah, the first haircut.

51:04.603 --> 51:05.763
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

51:07.439 --> 51:08.428
First tooth.

51:14.446 --> 51:15.435
(SIGHS)

51:15.531 --> 51:17.021
It‘s my first blanket.

51:18.158 --> 51:19.443
It was from my birth mother.

51:22.663 --> 51:24.028
It came with this.

51:26.041 --> 51:27.827
It says,
"Wherever you go..."

51:33.299 --> 51:34.960
"I will always love you."

51:35.092 --> 51:36.332
(SHUDDERS)

51:43.267 --> 51:44.256
Oh, my God.

51:45.561 --> 51:47.552
How? (SNIFFLES)
My dad.

51:48.147 --> 51:49.762
I'm completely pissed at him.

51:49.857 --> 51:53.691
You know, for years,
after my mom died,
I tried to find you,

51:53.986 --> 51:56.693
but it was just
a series of dead ends.

51:56.780 --> 51:58.896
So, lsort ofgave up.

52:00.326 --> 52:01.862
But apparently he didn't.

52:03.912 --> 52:05.823
That was a good decision.

52:06.624 --> 52:09.787
I used to always wonder
what your voice sounded like.

52:10.711 --> 52:11.917
Oh, my God.

52:18.218 --> 52:20.004
Did you ever search for me?

52:23.140 --> 52:26.007
You know, the adoption agency
advised me not to.

52:26.101 --> 52:30.811
They said that
you were with a good family
and that I shouldn't.

52:33.984 --> 52:36.441
But every time I saw
a little girl, I would think,

52:38.822 --> 52:40.813
"Is that what
Sarah looks like now?"

52:41.950 --> 52:43.315
You called me Sarah?

52:44.536 --> 52:45.776
So, lwould have been

52:45.871 --> 52:49.034
Sarah Rosalina
de la Santa Cruz
Davilla Vargas?

52:50.751 --> 52:51.786
You see why I shortened it.

52:52.002 --> 52:53.208
(BOTH LAUGH)

52:54.505 --> 52:55.711
Oh...

52:55.798 --> 52:57.254
(BOTH LAUGH)

53:01.178 --> 53:02.384
ZOE: Can I ask...

53:03.389 --> 53:04.970
What about my father?

53:06.558 --> 53:07.843
I met him at a party.

53:10.771 --> 53:12.557
Does he know about me?

53:14.817 --> 53:17.058
I never even
knew his last name.

53:18.278 --> 53:21.770
But he was the most beautiful
boy I had ever seen.

53:22.741 --> 53:23.730
He was?

53:24.576 --> 53:26.282
And very sweet.

53:32.292 --> 53:37.161
But I was 16 and
basically on my own, and...

53:39.758 --> 53:41.339
But I knew
you had to be born.

53:41.802 --> 53:43.542
Wasn't even a question.

53:46.223 --> 53:50.307
I'd left school. You know,
got twojobs. But I didn't
have anybody to watch you.

53:50.394 --> 53:53.682
They were gonna take you away.
You know, put you back
in the system.

53:54.398 --> 53:55.888
And Ijust couldn't
let that happen.

53:58.193 --> 54:00.684
But knowing that I was
given up for adoption...

54:01.530 --> 54:04.021
You can't help but grow up
with a sense of rejection.

54:04.825 --> 54:05.905
"Am I good enough?"

54:07.327 --> 54:08.817
"Is something wrong with me?"

54:09.705 --> 54:10.694
Exactly.

54:17.171 --> 54:18.877
I would have done
anything to keep you.

54:21.759 --> 54:24.967
You know, I know we haven't
exactly gotten along,

54:25.053 --> 54:27.544
but I really admire you.

54:28.223 --> 54:30.339
Just everything
you've accomplished.

54:31.852 --> 54:33.888
You're kind of who I wanna be
when I grow up.

54:48.160 --> 54:49.741
ZOE: I found my old research.

54:54.291 --> 54:55.280
You okay?

54:57.586 --> 55:01.454
Well, I took out the really
good stuff 'cause I am still
going to kick your ass.

55:01.548 --> 55:02.628
(CHUCKLES)

55:03.008 --> 55:06.717
By the way, I don't think
we need to tell people
at work about this.

55:07.304 --> 55:09.090
Agreed.
Cool.

55:09.181 --> 55:11.672
Then let's go,
because I am starving.

55:11.767 --> 55:12.882
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

55:15.687 --> 55:18.053
JOAN: So that's
where you've been?

55:18.148 --> 55:19.604
Jiminy crickets.

55:19.691 --> 55:21.647
Oh, for God's sakes, would you
just please start cursing?

55:21.735 --> 55:24.818
No. Whatever. Come on.
(STAMMERING)
So, what is she like?

55:26.114 --> 55:27.524
You know, it's so bizarre.

55:27.616 --> 55:29.698
Last week,
she was North Korea.

55:29.785 --> 55:32.948
And now when I think
about her, lcan't
stop smiling. (CHUCKLES)

55:33.038 --> 55:34.027
Aw.

55:34.122 --> 55:35.282
That's so nice.

55:35.374 --> 55:36.739
She wants to get to know me.

55:37.000 --> 55:37.989
Oh.

55:38.126 --> 55:39.536
Shoes.

55:39.628 --> 55:41.744
Yeah, says she wants
to make up for lost time.

55:41.839 --> 55:43.295
Well, that's great.
Mmm-mmm.

55:44.007 --> 55:46.123
Not great. She wants to
meet my friends.

55:46.218 --> 55:47.424
So? I'd be happy to.

55:47.511 --> 55:51.880
No. My "friends" from Harvard
and the Peace Corps.

55:51.974 --> 55:53.339
Who don't actually...
Yes!

55:53.433 --> 55:54.593
Oh, F-word.

55:55.602 --> 55:56.682
God, that's so annoying.

55:56.770 --> 55:57.850
What's annoying? Your face?

55:57.938 --> 55:58.927
(SIGHING) Oh, God.

55:59.940 --> 56:01.271
ANDERSON:
Thank you very much.

56:04.069 --> 56:05.980
I want to explain myself
to both of you.

56:07.072 --> 56:09.484
You don't have to, it's...
Oh, no, he does.

56:10.284 --> 56:12.570
We used to say
Zoe got her spirited streak
from her mother,

56:12.661 --> 56:14.777
but now we know
that's only half true.

56:15.581 --> 56:17.822
You know, when Zoe started
looking for you,

56:17.916 --> 56:20.077
I didn't know
if it was healthy or not.

56:20.168 --> 56:23.080
And, after a while,
you gave up.

56:24.172 --> 56:26.379
And something
went out in you.

56:26.717 --> 56:29.584
I know what your mother
would've said. She would've
said, "Fix it, Andy."

56:30.095 --> 56:32.302
So, I kept the feelers out.

56:32.389 --> 56:36.223
And then suddenly,
miraculously,
there you were online.

56:36.685 --> 56:38.050
And impressively so.

56:38.145 --> 56:40.852
I didn't know if you would
want to connect with Zoe,

56:40.939 --> 56:43.351
and I didn't wanna
take the chance
on her being rejected,

56:43.442 --> 56:47.185
so I brought you in under
the guise of a job interview
to suss you out.

56:47.279 --> 56:49.190
And you were terrific.
You were fantastic.

56:49.281 --> 56:52.068
I would've hired you
without this connection.

56:52.534 --> 56:53.944
And then Zoe walked in

56:54.036 --> 56:56.243
and seeing the two of you
butting heads together,
Ijust...

56:56.330 --> 56:57.740
You manipulated us.

56:57.831 --> 56:59.696
Well, perhaps.

57:00.417 --> 57:03.124
Although, I wasn't the one
who suggested the competition.

57:04.129 --> 57:05.209
BIG ANT: Maya?

57:05.839 --> 57:08.421
Is that Maria Maya Vargas?

57:08.508 --> 57:10.169
What are the odds?
(JOAN LAUGHS)

57:10.260 --> 57:11.375
Hello.

57:11.845 --> 57:15.804
Yes, we were just
on our way to the alumni
social for Norton.

57:15.891 --> 57:18.132
Wharton.
Norton. Wharton. Yep.

57:18.268 --> 57:21.476
Um, Zoe, Anderson,
these are my friends from...

57:21.563 --> 57:22.552
Harvard.

57:23.065 --> 57:25.852
We, uh, did some time

our men a reason to put
their tuxes on, so...

a reason to take 'em off.

You have no idea

how many times I still thought
about her every day.

"Is she okay? Is she happy?
Is she alive?"

Now I've found her,

And you know what?
I hate the lie.

that she thinks I am,

59:16.636 --> 59:17.967

ask them for more time.

01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:38.794
Well, the presentation
go good?

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:40.336
Uh... (SIGHS)

01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:42.289
Define good.
Did they like it?

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:44.340
Until PETA showed up.
DILLY: Auntie M.

01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:48.254
Dill! Oh, you're home!
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:49.338
DILLY: Hi.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:52.558
How's Stanford?
Yes. How's Stanford?
Tell her. I can't.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.432
I mean, why waste four years
on a piece of paper

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:57.262
that says I know how to do
what I already know how to do?

01:18:57.358 --> 01:18:58.347
Right.

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.058
Excuse me.

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:05.654
She's really pissed at me.

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:07.652
Yeah, she doesn't want you
to wind up like me.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:10.530
What are you talking about?
You're killing it right now.

01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:14.989
You‘re only allowed
so many bad decisions, Dill.

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:18.042
Dropping out now
handicaps your ability
to make good ones.

01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:19.243
Hey, look who's back.

01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:21.837
Hey!
Hey.

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:26.338
l... l was hoping to see you.
Yeah.

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:28.919
Yeah. You look different.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.755
Yeah.

01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:32.305
What, is that bad?
(CHUCKLES)

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:35.892
Hey, everyone. I...
lwanna thank you
all for coming

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:40.269
to celebrate
the only Christmas birthday
that actually matters.

01:19:40.359 --> 01:19:42.145
Earmuffs, Jesus,
you know you're my boo.

01:19:42.236 --> 01:19:43.351
JOAN: Cheers to me.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:46.023
Can I talk to you?

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:47.938
Yeah.

01:19:52.997 --> 01:19:54.328
Look, um...

01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:58.748
There's something
I never told you...
About your daughter.

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.660
Yeah. Joan, she told me.

01:20:02.548 --> 01:20:05.585
I mean, all that talk
about family and...

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:09.423
I thought it was me
you were hesitant about.

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:11.970
No, lwas ashamed. Ijust...

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:16.266
I thought
I didn't deserve to...

01:20:17.354 --> 01:20:18.343
(STAMMERS) Have...

01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:22.806
lshould‘ve told you.
You should've told me.

01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:25.768
You let me fall in love
with a version of you,

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:29.818
and no relationship built
on a lie can ever survive.

Well, you...

01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:37.742

What?

01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:56.382
Now?

01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:02.520
I can't believe
you're still here.

01:21:03.067 --> 01:21:04.523
Is everything okay?

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:07.397
Well, it could've
waited till Monday,

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:11.780
but then I wouldn't be able
to say this to you personally.

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:15.617
And you wouldn't
have the weekend
to prepare your speech.

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:17.778
Speech?

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:21.036
The board has
voted unanimously
to endorse your product.

01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:22.536

Oh, my God! Even after
the whole bird thing?

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:27.288
You know, I've never seen
a dove explode before.

Now, apart from the donation

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:35.129
we'll have to make
to the National Bird Society,

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:38.220
you are going to
help make this company
a lot of money.

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:40.551
And that is good for us all.
Mmm-hmm.

01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:43.183

at our Distributors Conference
this Monday.

Yeah. And, um,
there is one more thing.

We don't want you
to consult anymore.

01:21:57.162 --> 01:21:59.869
We want you to join us
at the company permanently.

(CHUCKLES)
Yes.

You should be ecstatic.

It's just been
a crazy couple of weeks,
that's all.

Yeah, for us both.

01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:38.150
You're quite the photographer.
(GROANS)

01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:41.362
Why didn't you tell me
that the photographs
in the apartment were yours?

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:45.075
I haven't
even touched a camera
in, like, five years.

01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:46.204
Do you miss it?

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.957
Sometimes,
but my dad needs me.

01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:52.755
Your dad needs you
to be happy.

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:57.298
Have you thought about
going back to school?

01:23:27.628 --> 01:23:32.338
Nothing. Just something
my ex-boyfriend said earlier.
Mmm-hmm.

I didn't know you had a...

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:40.379
You just never
talked about him.

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.382
Why'd you guys split?

01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:48.058
I wasn't completely
honest with him.

01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:49.604
Why not?

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:54.817
I guess I was afraid to be.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.356

for a reason, right?

working together.

opportunity, butjust don't...

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:14.876

something holding you back
from taking the job.

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:19.960
I am so grateful
to have you back in my life.

really good for us.

the delayed response.

the last few weeks.

That’s quite all right.

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:21.818
I got your message.
I must say,
I’m a bit confused.

01:25:21.908 --> 01:25:24.615
We never had
a Maria Vargas work here.

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:25.783
Really?

01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:27.236
I checked with personnel,

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:31.290
went through all our
records, and, as far as
Estée Lauder is concerned,

01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:32.957
that person never existed.

01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:35.202
Okay, thank you.

the other night...

Yeah?

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:55.355

that you're, um...

01:25:55.442 --> 01:25:56.602
You're kinky?

01:25:57.152 --> 01:26:00.440
Oh, that. Oh, that'sjust
something I say.

01:26:04.701 --> 01:26:05.907
Or is it?

01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:13.782

Now, my father would normally
be making this introduction,

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:29.298
but because of
special circumstances,

01:26:29.393 --> 01:26:32.635
he is, for once,
allowing someone else
to get a word in.

a fresh perspective.

what you always say, Dad?

for giving me a chance.

You know, some people
never get a chance

01:27:27.367 --> 01:27:30.279
because they can't afford
the right education,

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:33.032
or they don‘t have the degree
to get in the right doors.

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:35.871
And you're correct, Zoe.

01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:40.835

because I wasn't afraid
to tell the truth.

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:44.873
Even if it hurts.

01:27:47.888 --> 01:27:49.219
And the truth is...

The truth is...

would even look at me
if you knew the truth.

Because I thought
I wasn't good enough.

So, I gave you
a version of me.

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:40.846

The stuff
about the adoption agency.

01:30:08.278 --> 01:30:09.859
Them telling you
not to look for me.

01:30:10.614 --> 01:30:11.820
Was that a lie, too?

01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:13.522
No, of course not.

01:30:13.617 --> 01:30:15.824
Well, how can I trust
anything you say?

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:21.780
Listen, this is why
I tried calling you
last night.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:23.785
I got my wish.

01:30:24.544 --> 01:30:26.125
I got my girl back.

01:30:26.212 --> 01:30:27.748
But I realized something.

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.547
Okay? No relationship
built on a lie can...

01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:31.669
Bullshit!

01:30:32.344 --> 01:30:33.834
You know, after my mom died,

01:30:33.929 --> 01:30:37.387
I put my entire life on hold
to be there for my dad.

01:30:37.474 --> 01:30:39.430
That‘s what families do.

01:30:39.517 --> 01:30:41.053
I'm not leaving you.

01:30:42.228 --> 01:30:44.184
I'm not going anywhere.
(SCOFFS)

01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:46.472
But I am.

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:51.100
Zoe!

01:30:51.988 --> 01:30:53.273
(SOMBER SONG PLAYING)

01:31:01.957 --> 01:31:03.072
MAYA: Dear Zoe,

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:05.703
I know that many people
believe in fate.

01:31:06.419 --> 01:31:09.206
And trust me, there are times
I wish I was one of them.

01:31:11.091 --> 01:31:13.503
I believe
we create our own fate,

01:31:13.593 --> 01:31:16.300
that our lives are shaped
by a series of choices.

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:18.594
(SONG CONTINUES PLAYING)

01:31:23.228 --> 01:31:24.934
One decision
leading to another,

01:31:25.522 --> 01:31:28.810
bringing us times of great joy
or years of regret.

01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:50.123
In the end, it’s up to us.
We get to write our own story.

01:31:50.755 --> 01:31:54.543
I 've made some
spectacularly awful choices
in my life.

01:31:54.634 --> 01:31:56.170
And two good ones.

01:31:56.928 --> 01:31:59.010
Alongside giving birth to you,

01:31:59.097 --> 01:32:02.055
the best decision I ever made
was to give you up.

01:32:17.907 --> 01:32:21.115
Because you never
would’ve become you if
it weren't for your parents.

01:32:32.797 --> 01:32:35.755
And because you're exactly
the person I'd like to be

01:32:35.842 --> 01:32:37.503
when I grow up.
(INAUDIBLE)

01:32:43.892 --> 01:32:47.476
You will always be
the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:53.014
I'm sorry I messed it up.
Again.

01:32:59.783 --> 01:33:01.023
(INAUDIBLE)

01:33:20.637 --> 01:33:22.252
(SONG ENDS)

01:33:22.347 --> 01:33:25.214
REPORTER: So you did
all this in one year?
MAYA: That's right.

01:33:25.308 --> 01:33:26.718
We created
a nationwide service

01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:30.394
where consumers could shop for
groceries locally from home.

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:32.516
And all you need tojoin
is an e-mail address.

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:34.438
And 20 bucks.
(MAYA CHUCKLES)

01:33:34.526 --> 01:33:38.360
You created an online store
specifically designed
for each member?

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:40.812
Yeah. And our clients
can even use their phone

01:33:40.907 --> 01:33:43.114
to pick out
a specific cut of meat,
or a prepared salad,

01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:44.782
or the third lemon
from the back.

01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:48.703
My godson Dilly over there
created the app
in between finals.

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:50.905
He works here
when he's not at Stanford.

01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:52.741
He's a genius. (CHUCKLES)

01:33:52.836 --> 01:33:56.328
You basically said
to Value Shop, "We're gonna
build a better mousetrap."

01:33:56.422 --> 01:33:58.754
And we said,
"We'd like to partner."

01:33:58.842 --> 01:34:01.333
He's our little
angel investor.

01:34:01.427 --> 01:34:03.713
We negotiated points
on some convertible debt.

01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:05.045
It's a cute deal.

01:34:06.724 --> 01:34:09.466
MAYA: We spend half our lives
looking back, wishing.

01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:13.019
If we 'd only
done it differently,
chosen smarter.

01:34:13.815 --> 01:34:15.726
Not made so many mistakes.

01:34:15.817 --> 01:34:17.728
He eats it.
If he didn't eat it,
then lwouldn't...

01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:21.437
Hi. Hi, can we talk
fora second?

01:34:24.159 --> 01:34:25.148
Yeah.

01:34:36.838 --> 01:34:39.420
So, I got what you left
on my doorstep.

01:34:40.842 --> 01:34:42.048
You really mean all this?

01:34:44.304 --> 01:34:45.464
Ask me anything.

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:47.966
Okay.

01:34:48.725 --> 01:34:50.056
Are you... (STAMMERS)
Yes.

01:34:51.436 --> 01:34:52.801
You don't know
what I was gonna ask.

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:55.599
Whatever the question is,
the answer's yes.

01:34:57.901 --> 01:35:00.313
Did you really
lose your daughter again?

01:35:02.822 --> 01:35:03.857
Yes.

01:35:05.241 --> 01:35:07.778
Are you ever
gonna lie to me again?

01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:13.821
Yes.

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:17.450
But that was the last time.

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:19.581
Funny.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

01:35:21.507 --> 01:35:24.840
Are you ready
to have a family?

01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:38.346
You are my family.

01:35:40.652 --> 01:35:41.858
So, yes.

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.235
JOAN: Sorry.

01:35:48.326 --> 01:35:51.068
This is broken and doesn't...
Okay.

(JOAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

01:36:03.841 --> 01:36:07.208
MAYA: But the truth is,
our mistakes don't limit us.

01:36:08.054 --> 01:36:09.885
Only our fears do.

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.757
And as unpredictable
as this journey has been,

01:36:14.394 --> 01:36:16.931
I am so glad
it finally led me back to you.

01:36:18.064 --> 01:36:19.429
Congratulations.

01:36:19.524 --> 01:36:20.980
Your dad told me
you were back.

01:36:21.567 --> 01:36:23.307
Welcome home.
Thanks.

01:36:24.487 --> 01:36:25.897
You got your degree.

01:36:27.907 --> 01:36:29.363
Now what?

01:36:31.744 --> 01:36:32.984
I don't know.

01:36:40.837 --> 01:36:42.748
You think
we could start over?

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:47.206
l was thinking
of going for a run.

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:51.344
(SOFTLY) Okay.

01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:54.801
Do you wanna
come with me?

01:37:00.398 --> 01:37:01.433
Yeah.

01:37:03.901 --> 01:37:05.141
I'd like that.

01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:08.815
A lot.

01:37:20.710 --> 01:37:22.120
I'm about to cry.
(SOBS)

01:37:23.087 --> 01:37:24.998
You guys are
fricking pussies.

01:37:25.089 --> 01:37:26.078
Oh, my.

01:37:26.758 --> 01:37:28.464
What? He said "fricking."

01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:29.586
It's progress.

01:37:30.762 --> 01:37:32.423
This time I'm not gonna be
as easy on you.

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:33.502
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.

01:37:33.598 --> 01:37:35.179
All right. Bring it.
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:43.517
MAYA: Every day you wake up
and have a second chance

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:44.939
to do whatever you want,

01:37:45.526 --> 01:37:47.107
to be whoever you want.

The only thing stopping you

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:51.187
is you.
