- <i>Previously, on</i> "MacGyver"...
- Hey. Hey, Mac.

00:03.890 --> 00:05.624
Dragonfly, that's it.
Grab it, let's go.

00:05.666 --> 00:07.538
What-what is
this Dragonfly, exactly?

00:07.603 --> 00:09.482
That information
is need-to-know.

00:09.583 --> 00:10.741
My name is Ethan Reigns.

00:10.806 --> 00:12.042
I'm making this video because

00:12.107 --> 00:13.747
tomorrow I start deep cover.

00:13.922 --> 00:15.269
Code name Dragonfly.

00:15.478 --> 00:19.106
Matty, this is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

00:19.264 --> 00:20.687
I'm so sorry.

00:22.228 --> 00:23.307
I love you.

00:25.083 --> 00:26.802
I love you, too.

00:56.391 --> 00:57.452
All right, Dan.

00:57.517 --> 00:59.179
What's so important
that it was worth

00:59.244 --> 01:01.225
interrupting Christmas dinner
with your family?

01:01.290 --> 01:03.539
You should know the Agency
isn't gonna do anything.

01:03.883 --> 01:04.974
About what?

01:05.039 --> 01:06.598
You didn't get this from me.

01:26.165 --> 01:27.467
Honestly, Bozer.

01:27.532 --> 01:29.054
I don't know why
you bother anymore.

01:29.166 --> 01:32.161
How about next year we just keep
it simple, order some takeout.

01:32.244 --> 01:33.632
Yeah. Yeah, man.
That way

01:33.697 --> 01:35.140
when some dingbat terrorist

01:35.205 --> 01:37.163
tries to steal
an intercontinental missile

01:37.228 --> 01:38.593
or weaponize the weather,

01:38.658 --> 01:41.577
we're not... stuck wasting
four pounds of pastrami,

01:41.642 --> 01:42.999
trying to save the world
in slacks.

01:43.064 --> 01:45.319
Two things I never thought
I'd hear in the same sentence:

01:45.384 --> 01:48.919
"intercontinental missile"
and my Christmas pastrami.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.970
Okay, I'm still not
connecting the dots

01:51.035 --> 01:52.624
between Christmas
and cured meat.

01:52.689 --> 01:55.718
Well, the secret's in the marinade.
Please, don't get him started.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.819
Yeah, trust me, you do not want
to go down that road.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.561
Yeah, you're not gonna
want to start that conversation

01:59.626 --> 02:01.660
unless your afternoon
is clear.

02:01.741 --> 02:03.679
No, ignore the haters, Leanna.

02:03.744 --> 02:05.843
As soon as we get back from
dealing with these terrorists,

02:05.908 --> 02:07.077
I'll tell you the origin story

02:07.142 --> 02:10.107
of the greatest holiday
tradition since mistletoe.

02:10.455 --> 02:11.703
On second thought, why wait?

02:11.768 --> 02:12.850
- You know, when I was...
- Hey, guys.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.860
I don't think
this is about terrorists.

02:15.364 --> 02:17.740
When Matty asked us
to come in, it...

02:18.994 --> 02:20.521
sounded personal.

02:24.767 --> 02:25.936
Hey, Matty.
What's going on?

02:26.001 --> 02:27.287
Close the door.

02:35.883 --> 02:38.802
Yesterday a man
named Samir Verma

02:39.015 --> 02:42.277
was arrested for smuggling
half a ton of heroin into Croatia.

02:42.342 --> 02:44.328
My friend at the Agency
passed me footage

02:44.393 --> 02:45.672
of Samir's interrogation

02:45.737 --> 02:48.435
from Lepavina Prison,
where he's being held.

02:54.499 --> 02:56.731
Do we maybe want to run
some translation software?

02:56.796 --> 03:00.404
Forget the cops.
Focus on Samir's body language.

03:05.443 --> 03:06.577
This guy got caught

03:06.642 --> 03:08.615
smuggling half a ton of heroin?

03:09.195 --> 03:11.050
What's the minimum sentence
for that in Croatia?

03:11.115 --> 03:12.663
Decade. Maybe even two.

03:13.017 --> 03:15.315
Well, if that's the case,
then what is this chucklehead

03:15.380 --> 03:16.621
smiling about?

03:16.686 --> 03:18.117
This.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.543
Tell the American CIA

03:22.767 --> 03:25.833
that I know
all about Ethan Reigns.

03:25.999 --> 03:29.593
And I will start talking
in 48 hours

03:29.916 --> 03:33.083
unless they walk me
out the front door.

03:33.182 --> 03:34.451
Are we supposed to know

03:34.517 --> 03:38.685
- who Ethan Reigns...
- Ethan Reigns... is my husband.

03:43.115 --> 03:45.669
Matty, d-did you just say
your husband?

03:47.798 --> 03:49.257
Ethan and I
worked together

03:49.322 --> 03:52.072
at the CIA
until eight years ago

03:52.137 --> 03:54.212
when he accepted
an undercover assignment

03:54.501 --> 03:57.096
and was inserted into
the largest criminal syndicate

03:57.161 --> 03:59.419
in South Asia,
S-Company,

03:59.593 --> 04:00.647
a group that profits

04:00.712 --> 04:02.140
from drug trafficking,
kidnapping

04:02.205 --> 04:03.845
and politically motivated
bombings.

04:04.517 --> 04:06.357
Ethan's assignment...

04:07.119 --> 04:08.904
was code-named Dragonfly.

04:09.273 --> 04:10.742
Dragonfly?

04:10.952 --> 04:13.428
That's the name of the file you
sent us into Ghana to recover.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.833
Ethan was only supposed to be
under for a year,

04:16.003 --> 04:18.007
but as he rose up
the S-Company ranks,

04:18.072 --> 04:20.350
he kept passing back
increasingly valuable intel

04:20.415 --> 04:22.083
to the CIA, so...

04:22.611 --> 04:24.888
they kept extending
his assignment.

04:25.135 --> 04:27.655
Samir is threatening
to expose Ethan as a spy

04:27.720 --> 04:29.827
if the CIA doesn't comply
with his demands.

04:29.892 --> 04:30.927
Wouldn't take long

04:30.992 --> 04:32.225
for a rumor like that
to get

04:32.290 --> 04:34.257
from the prison population
back to S-Company.

04:34.322 --> 04:35.727
At which that point,
they would...

04:35.792 --> 04:38.256
- Kill him.
- All right, hang on, now, hang on.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.307
If the CIA sent you this video,

04:40.372 --> 04:42.213
that means they saw it
before you did.

04:42.278 --> 04:44.600
Why wouldn't they
just send Ethan a signal

04:44.845 --> 04:47.530
warning him that his cover
had been compromised?

04:47.595 --> 04:50.111
- Warning Ethan is not a possibility.
- Why not?

04:50.178 --> 04:53.843
Because two years,
three months and 11 days ago,

04:53.908 --> 04:55.981
Ethan stopped communicating
with his handler.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.624
All efforts to locate him

04:57.689 --> 04:59.709
in Mumbai, where he was
living at the time, failed.

04:59.774 --> 05:02.509
The CIA's theory
is that Ethan flipped sides.

05:02.574 --> 05:06.365
But the truth is
nobody knows why he went dark.

05:07.212 --> 05:08.658
Two years.

05:08.736 --> 05:10.585
- Matty, I'm so sorry.
- My friend at the Agency

05:10.650 --> 05:11.702
passed me the footage

05:11.767 --> 05:14.054
because Uncle Sam
is currently negotiating

05:14.119 --> 05:16.603
a new trade agreement
with the Croatian government.

05:16.668 --> 05:19.038
- What does that have to do with...
- Well, the U.S. government

05:19.103 --> 05:21.255
isn't gonna waste
the political capital

05:21.350 --> 05:23.233
to transfer Samir
to another prison.

05:23.298 --> 05:24.655
Not when they have
bigger fish to fry.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.880
And... I can't say I blame them.

05:27.154 --> 05:29.232
So no one's going
to help Ethan.

05:29.307 --> 05:31.486
No one but us.
You need us

05:31.551 --> 05:34.193
to break into that prison,
grab Samir, break back out

05:34.297 --> 05:36.880
before he has a chance to tell
anyone else what he knows.

05:37.794 --> 05:40.169
My husband's life
depends on it.

KC and The Sunshine Band?

07:23.018 --> 07:24.406
- Really?
- Who doesn't love

07:42.063 --> 07:43.663
Now, they first met

07:43.728 --> 07:46.875
when Ethan saved Matty
on an op that went belly-up.

07:46.940 --> 07:49.578
You know,
he and I had only crossed paths

07:49.643 --> 07:51.320
a couple of times
at the CIA.

07:51.385 --> 07:52.828
He had
a reputation for being

07:52.893 --> 07:54.258
an exceptional agent

07:54.323 --> 07:57.008
with a certain pizzazz for
getting under the ASAC's skin,

07:57.073 --> 07:58.695
which is something
I kind of liked about him,

07:58.760 --> 07:59.952
to be honest with you.

08:00.057 --> 08:01.558
But I was one of the only ones

08:01.623 --> 08:04.555
that knew that, uh,
those two were an item.

08:04.620 --> 08:08.703
That's not really
condoned behavior at the Agency.

08:09.112 --> 08:11.959
There were some grumblings
that he was on a deep cover op.

08:12.024 --> 08:14.358
I didn't know the details,
but, you know...

08:14.643 --> 08:16.268
I knew enough not to ask.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.664
You know what I mean?

08:17.729 --> 08:19.148
Can't believe this.

08:19.213 --> 08:21.131
- What, that Matty was married?
- No.

08:21.260 --> 08:23.686
That Jack was able
to keep a secret for that long.

08:27.573 --> 08:29.422
I'm still trying
to wrap my head around the fact

08:29.487 --> 08:32.241
that if this Samir guy
never got arrested,

08:32.370 --> 08:34.008
- we never would've found out.
- I know.

08:34.073 --> 08:36.828
I feel like, all of a sudden,
Matty's a totally different person.

08:36.894 --> 08:39.683
Nah.
Same person, Boze.

08:39.748 --> 08:42.203
You're just getting to peek
behind the curtain, that's all.

08:42.268 --> 08:44.475
Two years is a long time
to wonder what happened

08:44.540 --> 08:45.687
to someone you love.

08:45.752 --> 08:47.695
Especially since the CIA's
official position

08:47.760 --> 08:49.451
is that Ethan flipped sides.

08:49.729 --> 08:51.242
I don't buy that
for a second.

08:51.307 --> 08:53.539
Matty Webber is
a human lie detector.

08:53.604 --> 08:56.078
No way she'd get married to a
guy who'd bat for the bad guys.

08:56.143 --> 08:58.101
But nobody's immune to
what happens to your head

08:58.166 --> 08:59.311
when you go under.

08:59.376 --> 09:02.488
Y-You walk enough in the shoes
of whatever role you're playing,

09:02.553 --> 09:04.866
soon enough, you're gonna
see things their way.

09:05.701 --> 09:07.908
Guys, I hate to say this,
but...

09:08.590 --> 09:11.006
there could be another
reason Ethan went dark.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.858
If he didn't flip, I mean.

09:14.354 --> 09:17.290
He was exposed as a U.S.
operative, and executed.

09:17.355 --> 09:19.655
Yeah, there is that.

09:21.073 --> 09:22.797
She must have
so many questions.

09:22.862 --> 09:23.966
Yeah.

09:36.133 --> 09:37.248
Hey, Matty.

09:37.313 --> 09:38.617
Blondie.

09:43.469 --> 09:46.185
I've been replaying all the
conversations that we've had

09:46.250 --> 09:48.490
over the last year, while I was
searching for my dad,

09:48.555 --> 09:50.785
and all the times that you've
been there for me.

09:51.499 --> 09:53.990
And then I realized that you've
been living the same nightmare

09:54.055 --> 09:56.473
with your husband,
and I had no idea.

09:56.554 --> 09:57.918
It's okay, Mac.

09:57.983 --> 10:00.419
You didn't know, because,
I didn't tell you.

10:00.484 --> 10:03.941
How did you do your job every day,
like everything was fine?

10:06.969 --> 10:08.523
I'm in awe.

10:10.141 --> 10:12.277
But I also
wanted to tell you,

10:12.630 --> 10:14.701
I wanted you to know

10:15.102 --> 10:17.474
that I am going to do
everything that I can

10:17.539 --> 10:19.467
to make sure that you get
the answers you deserve.

10:19.532 --> 10:21.259
Just like you did for me.

10:22.133 --> 10:23.816
I know you will.

10:37.741 --> 10:39.561
Bozer and I are in position.

10:41.539 --> 10:43.534
I'm behind
the prison's firewall.

10:43.778 --> 10:45.888
Now I just need to give myself
super-user access,

10:45.953 --> 10:47.777
and we can really have
some fun.

10:52.696 --> 10:54.428
Good work, Riles.

10:55.971 --> 10:58.399
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:01.168 --> 11:03.281
Up, up and away.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.079
Oh, yeah, yeah,
that's-that's high enough, Boze.

11:13.144 --> 11:14.180
What's worse...

11:14.245 --> 11:15.274
Your fear of heights,

11:15.339 --> 11:16.705
or running into
all that razor wire?

11:16.770 --> 11:17.900
Do I have to choose?

11:17.965 --> 11:20.336
Just set me down nice,
nice and easy.

11:24.137 --> 11:26.070
No, no. No. No.

11:26.902 --> 11:27.954
No, no.

11:28.046 --> 11:29.883
No, no. No, no.

11:34.076 --> 11:35.144
Oh!

11:37.457 --> 11:39.000
He's gonna feel that
in the morning.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.867
All right, guys, I think

11:41.035 --> 11:43.297
we might want to recalibrate
the pitch on that thing.

11:43.362 --> 11:44.703
- Yeah.
- Sorry about that.

11:44.768 --> 11:46.902
You'll have to walk it off later, Mac.
We got to move.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.339
Okay.

11:55.692 --> 11:57.336
All right, I'm in.

12:00.103 --> 12:01.422
Emergency power
just kicked on.

12:01.487 --> 12:02.602
How do I find Samir,
Riley?

12:02.667 --> 12:05.477
Uh, he's in cell block D,
cell 14.

12:05.542 --> 12:07.782
All right, Mac, I'm about ready
to wipe these records.

12:07.847 --> 12:09.764
Once you confirm
you've found Samir,

12:09.902 --> 12:12.413
I'll make it like
he was never even here.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.901
Samir?

12:41.902 --> 12:44.350
We got your message.
I'm here to get you out.

12:44.814 --> 12:46.982
You are from the CIA?

12:47.120 --> 12:50.077
I need you to
swallow this.

12:50.956 --> 12:53.512
- What is it?
- The key to unlocking this door.

12:53.594 --> 12:56.428
Yeah, or it kills me before
I can tell anyone what I know. Look,

12:56.493 --> 12:57.678
you asked for help,
and here we are.

12:57.743 --> 12:59.100
You think arranging
this was easy?

12:59.165 --> 13:01.162
That pill is the only way
to get out of this cell,

13:01.227 --> 13:02.553
and time is a serious factor.

13:02.618 --> 13:04.231
Now swallow it.

13:06.993 --> 13:08.920
Samir, if we wanted you dead,

13:08.985 --> 13:10.520
you'd be dead already.

13:10.633 --> 13:12.397
I work for someone
who has questions.

13:12.462 --> 13:14.248
Questions
only you can answer.

13:14.313 --> 13:15.865
But if you want to
get out of this prison,

13:15.930 --> 13:17.480
you're gonna have to trust me.

13:17.735 --> 13:20.016
Hey. Hey!

13:20.467 --> 13:22.896
Take the pill.

13:23.497 --> 13:24.973
Swallow it.

13:26.375 --> 13:28.715
Samir took the pill,
but I've been made.

13:29.258 --> 13:30.988
Things are about
to get complicated.

13:49.399 --> 13:52.381
The guards think
Prisoner 1138 was poisoned

13:52.446 --> 13:54.084
by someone posing
as one of them.

13:54.149 --> 13:55.646
Mac, what's your status?

13:55.711 --> 13:57.576
Not great.
If we don't get Samir the injection

13:57.641 --> 14:00.215
in ten minutes, 32 seconds,
he really is gonna end up dead.

14:04.871 --> 14:07.930
Uh, guys,
we may have another problem.

14:07.995 --> 14:09.250
Samir made a phone call

14:09.315 --> 14:10.493
- five hours ago.
- Who did he call?

14:10.558 --> 14:12.290
- I don't know.
- <i>Maybe he got lonely</i>

14:12.355 --> 14:13.339
<i>and called his mom.</i>

14:13.404 --> 14:14.908
<i>Even dirtbags have mommies.</i>

14:14.973 --> 14:16.102
Maybe isn't good enough.

14:16.167 --> 14:17.946
<i>If Samir called someone
in S-Company,</i>

14:18.011 --> 14:19.274
<i>Ethan's as good as dead.</i>

14:19.339 --> 14:20.406
<i>Riley, get me a name.</i>

14:22.089 --> 14:24.446
<i>Send an ambulance.
An inmate is having...</i>

14:24.511 --> 14:27.071
Prison medics just reached out
to the local hospital.

14:27.136 --> 14:29.656
Jack, Bozer, Leanna,
that's your cue.

14:54.871 --> 14:56.640
Leanna, you got
less than one minute

14:56.705 --> 14:58.531
before we lose Samir for good.

15:05.730 --> 15:06.754
Done.

15:06.832 --> 15:09.554
All right, package is in hand.
Let's get the hell out of Dodge.

15:32.124 --> 15:34.161
That pill... what did it do?

15:37.437 --> 15:38.833
Are you even CIA?

15:38.899 --> 15:39.976
Riley.

15:43.499 --> 15:45.700
<i>Yes, hello.
This is Samir Verma.</i>

15:45.765 --> 15:47.597
<i>We know
some of the same people.</i>

15:47.717 --> 15:49.239
- What people?
- It doesn't matter.

15:49.304 --> 15:50.450
I'm calling to tell you,

15:50.515 --> 15:53.697
you have a CIA spy undercover
in your organization.

15:53.762 --> 15:55.354
He's been with you for years.

15:55.419 --> 15:56.979
I will give you his name

15:57.044 --> 15:59.485
if you help me out
of my current situation.

16:02.067 --> 16:03.471
I only made that call

16:03.536 --> 16:05.055
because I didn't know
you were coming.

16:05.122 --> 16:06.307
If someone had told me...

16:06.372 --> 16:08.845
It wasn't enough you asked
the CIA for help, was it?

16:09.706 --> 16:11.825
You had to play
both sides.

16:12.622 --> 16:15.963
Can you really blame a guy for
exploring all of his options?

16:16.028 --> 16:17.352
Besides, I didn't even
give them

16:17.417 --> 16:18.680
the agent's name,
so what's the problem?

16:18.745 --> 16:20.139
What's the problem?

16:21.034 --> 16:22.219
The problem

16:22.284 --> 16:25.408
is that now S-Company thinks
they have a mole problem,

16:25.541 --> 16:28.991
which means, Samir, that you
now have a "me" problem.

16:29.347 --> 16:31.691
Nobody knows we pulled you
out of that prison,

16:31.756 --> 16:33.606
so no one will ask
a single question

16:33.671 --> 16:36.350
if you just happen to topple out
the back of this plane.

16:36.565 --> 16:38.592
Yeah, she's
dead serious.

16:41.158 --> 16:43.065
Now I'm gonna
ask you some questions.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.744
And what happens to you next
is based entirely

16:45.809 --> 16:48.499
on how helpful I feel your
answers are, do you understand?

16:48.573 --> 16:49.729
Good.

16:50.183 --> 16:51.862
How did you learn
that Ethan Reigns was

16:51.940 --> 16:53.908
an undercover CIA agent?

16:55.948 --> 16:56.985
He recruited me

16:57.050 --> 16:59.435
to introduce him
to a business associate of mine.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.655
This was years
ago in Mumbai.

17:02.042 --> 17:05.296
I realized then
that Ethan was CIA.

17:05.444 --> 17:07.263
Did some digging,
but stayed quiet.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.299
I figured, someday,
I might be able

17:09.364 --> 17:11.818
to use the info. Ethan's
old undercover reports

17:11.883 --> 17:13.616
mention a CI
he cultivated in Mumbai.

17:17.006 --> 17:18.912
Is Reigns still alive?

17:24.762 --> 17:25.994
When's the last time
you saw him?

17:26.060 --> 17:28.096
Face-to-face?
A few years.

17:28.161 --> 17:30.590
But he's done well for himself
in S-Company.

17:30.864 --> 17:32.368
Wasn't hard to keep track of.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.924
Where is Ethan Reigns right now?

17:33.989 --> 17:36.060
Last I heard, Cyprus. Leanna,

17:36.195 --> 17:38.053
give the pilot new coordinates.

17:38.189 --> 17:40.049
You're gonna need
to be more specific.

17:40.114 --> 17:42.248
That's all I know, I swear.

17:42.505 --> 17:46.549
I heard Ethan was sent to Cyprus
to expand S-Company's territory.

17:46.614 --> 17:48.376
They're making
some big moves there.

17:48.950 --> 17:51.958
If I knew more, I'd tell you.

17:53.794 --> 17:55.075
I would.

18:13.641 --> 18:15.263
Matty?

18:16.905 --> 18:19.590
Matty, hey, hey,
hey, boss lady.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.362
Oh, hey, what's going on?

18:21.427 --> 18:23.177
Now, deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

18:23.242 --> 18:25.534
- Deep breaths now.
- The moment S-Company got that call,

18:25.599 --> 18:28.079
they would've started searching
for the undercover agent.

18:28.833 --> 18:30.071
It's only a
matter of time

18:30.136 --> 18:32.165
before they realize that Ethan
crossed paths with Samir.

18:32.230 --> 18:33.862
I know, but we're gonna
get to Cyprus,

18:33.927 --> 18:35.690
and we're gonna find him before
they connect those dots.

18:35.755 --> 18:37.743
I promise, okay?
Hey.

18:37.931 --> 18:40.259
I promise.
It's gonna be all right.

18:40.372 --> 18:41.845
You hear me?

18:42.718 --> 18:44.727
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:45.989 --> 18:49.011
There you go.
It'll be all right.

19:26.248 --> 19:29.032
Honey, I'm home!
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

19:29.146 --> 19:32.267
Nobody moves, or it's your last
day breathing. Who's Lutsky?

19:33.325 --> 19:35.159
- I said, who's Lutsky?!
- Me.

19:35.224 --> 19:37.212
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell am I?

19:38.135 --> 19:40.673
I'm the guy
who's asking the questions.

19:41.868 --> 19:43.860
We're all good in here, Mac!

19:50.128 --> 19:52.040
Nice fastball, Mac.

19:52.263 --> 19:55.870
Actually, in cricket,
it's called a... Never mind.

19:55.935 --> 19:58.095
Oh, lookie there.

19:59.005 --> 20:00.831
That's not a terrible plan,

20:00.896 --> 20:02.571
but a few minor problems,
though.

20:02.661 --> 20:03.995
This corner...

20:04.060 --> 20:05.213
They built a guard tower

20:05.278 --> 20:06.400
so this guy would be seen

20:06.465 --> 20:07.751
coming a mile away.

20:07.830 --> 20:08.887
Plus,

20:08.994 --> 20:10.440
we broke out Samir last night.

20:10.505 --> 20:11.885
You hear that?
We beat you to it.

20:11.950 --> 20:14.752
That's how we knew Samir called
you from prison, dum-dum.

20:14.817 --> 20:16.742
Samir made
a big mistake calling here.

20:16.807 --> 20:19.221
You know, we've always known
that S-Company communicates

20:19.286 --> 20:21.690
on a custom-built cellular
network, which is why

20:21.755 --> 20:24.644
it was always so impossible
to run digital surveillance

20:24.709 --> 20:26.774
on you and your scumbag pals.

20:27.271 --> 20:28.954
We never had a way in,

20:29.080 --> 20:31.138
until now.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.893
You're gonna write down the
names of everyone you spoke to

20:33.958 --> 20:35.923
after you hung up with Samir.

20:37.053 --> 20:38.743
I'm-I'm left-handed.

20:40.435 --> 20:41.635
Not today, you're not.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.595
Get to writing.

20:47.025 --> 20:49.120
Hey, good news, Matty.
The data we mined

20:49.185 --> 20:52.401
from those devices cracked
S-Company's cell network wide open.

20:52.466 --> 20:55.124
I'm looking at communications
here dating back years.

20:55.189 --> 20:57.835
Gonna take time to untangle
all this fresh intel, but...

20:58.095 --> 20:59.866
it looks like a treasure trove.

21:00.079 --> 21:02.038
Man, these guys are
into some dark stuff.

21:02.103 --> 21:03.614
What kind of dark stuff?

21:05.695 --> 21:07.200
Abductions.

21:07.315 --> 21:08.747
Murders.

21:08.972 --> 21:11.600
Looks like this S-Company's
willing to do anything

21:11.665 --> 21:13.548
to protect the expansion
of their trafficking business

21:13.613 --> 21:14.896
into Cyprus.

21:16.618 --> 21:18.217
I just got 37 mentions

21:18.282 --> 21:20.439
of Ethan's undercover name
in texts and e-mails,

21:20.504 --> 21:22.505
all pointing
to one IMEI number.

21:22.637 --> 21:24.006
Wait, you got
Ethan's phone number?

21:24.071 --> 21:26.575
<i>Yeah. But before you get
too excited,</i>

21:26.650 --> 21:28.577
as of yesterday,
S-Company's been snooping

21:28.642 --> 21:30.764
- on all their people's cell traffic.
- Well, yeah,

21:30.829 --> 21:32.212
they're looking for a mole.
If we call Ethan

21:32.277 --> 21:33.418
on his cell phone,
we'll out him.

21:33.483 --> 21:34.952
Yeah, but it's not all bad news.

21:35.017 --> 21:36.819
I can track his cell phone
in real time.

21:36.884 --> 21:39.552
Judging by his speed,
he's in a car.

21:40.213 --> 21:41.592
Great work, you two.

21:41.657 --> 21:43.060
I'll get the van.

21:48.563 --> 21:49.991
You okay, Matty?

21:52.229 --> 21:53.795
Since the day Ethan left,

21:53.860 --> 21:56.468
I've imagined what it would be
like to see him again.

21:56.533 --> 21:58.567
And now that the moment's
almost here,

21:59.002 --> 22:01.481
I don't know if I'll be able
to get a word out.

22:04.712 --> 22:05.819
Look, I don't really want

22:05.884 --> 22:07.437
to bring this up, but...

22:07.751 --> 22:09.132
we want you
to be prepared.

22:09.259 --> 22:10.265
For?

22:10.548 --> 22:12.490
Eight years undercover
is no joke.

22:12.555 --> 22:14.506
You spend all that time
looking over your shoulder.

22:14.571 --> 22:16.546
It can weigh on you.
It can affect any person.

22:16.611 --> 22:17.749
You know what I mean?

22:17.814 --> 22:19.366
What I get is that you two

22:19.431 --> 22:21.030
are trying
to dance around telling me

22:21.095 --> 22:23.356
that surviving in S-Company
this long means

22:23.421 --> 22:25.638
Ethan's seen things,
done things,

22:25.939 --> 22:28.311
things that likely turned him
into a very different man

22:28.376 --> 22:29.872
than the one
I fell in love with.

22:30.017 --> 22:32.075
That pretty much
sums it up, yeah.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.505
I've ran spies for decades.

22:34.611 --> 22:36.053
I know
what could be waiting for me.

22:36.118 --> 22:37.280
I've known
since the day he left.

22:37.345 --> 22:39.544
But I can't think
about that now.

22:40.047 --> 22:41.734
Let's save his life today.

22:41.993 --> 22:43.741
I'll figure out
the rest tomorrow.

22:56.230 --> 22:58.056
According to this,
he should be on that street

22:58.121 --> 22:59.675
over there.

23:17.926 --> 23:19.340
Ethan.

23:22.965 --> 23:24.797
All I'm saying

23:24.918 --> 23:28.469
is that there's other musical choices
out there.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.166
And if we're gonna
be sharing a life,

23:30.231 --> 23:32.252
you may want
to consider expanding

23:32.317 --> 23:33.892
your musical horizons.
That's all I'm saying.

23:33.957 --> 23:36.219
Okay.
All I'm saying is that everything,

23:36.284 --> 23:39.556
whether it's rock
or rap or house,

23:39.621 --> 23:41.580
it all comes back
to disco anyway,

23:41.645 --> 23:45.336
so why not just stay there,
at the source?

23:46.879 --> 23:48.681
How did you get like this?

23:48.746 --> 23:51.330
You were, like, six
when the '70s ended.

23:51.395 --> 23:53.392
My parents listened to disco
when I was growing up.

23:53.457 --> 23:55.375
It just reminds me of them.

23:56.932 --> 23:58.548
I'm sorry
they couldn't be here.

23:58.613 --> 23:59.762
It's okay.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.720
I don't need
a big, fancy wedding

24:01.785 --> 24:04.313
with a bunch of guests
fawning all over us.

24:04.395 --> 24:05.938
I just need you.

24:07.622 --> 24:09.580
And Padre
What's-his-name.

24:09.645 --> 24:11.025
What ishis name?

24:11.090 --> 24:13.844
I have
absolutely no idea.

24:13.960 --> 24:15.187
Aquí estás.

24:15.628 --> 24:16.881
Thank you.

24:17.378 --> 24:18.660
Gracias.

24:19.975 --> 24:21.794
- Wait, wait. Hmm?
- Um... Huh?

24:21.980 --> 24:24.005
Before we drink,
we need to talk.

24:24.164 --> 24:27.009
Oh, do we have to?
We're having such a good time.

24:27.074 --> 24:28.509
We're having such a good time

24:28.574 --> 24:30.860
because we don't know
anyone down here, Ethan.

24:30.925 --> 24:33.366
- Mm-hmm.
- Eventually, we have to go back home.

24:34.433 --> 24:36.749
So what are we
gonna tell the Agency?

24:36.972 --> 24:38.813
Well, as far as
they are concerned,

24:38.878 --> 24:40.468
we're on an op.

24:40.667 --> 24:42.110
And I don't think
they're gonna go looking

24:42.175 --> 24:45.187
for a marriage certificate
in the Osa Peninsula.

24:46.670 --> 24:48.058
Um...

24:48.136 --> 24:49.937
aren't you forgetting
about something?

24:53.152 --> 24:55.391
What if we
only wear them

24:55.456 --> 24:57.382
when we're not working?

25:00.171 --> 25:02.338
Oh, it's a good idea.

25:04.448 --> 25:06.007
- Deal.
- Deal.

25:10.058 --> 25:11.150
To you.

25:12.652 --> 25:14.199
♪ Dance

25:14.277 --> 25:16.843
Aah! Let's go dance.

25:22.799 --> 25:23.800
Let's go.

25:23.886 --> 25:25.640
All right, hang on. Matty,

25:25.831 --> 25:28.320
something tells me that
Ethan and his pals

25:28.385 --> 25:31.718
are about to break
a few major laws here.

25:32.621 --> 25:34.342
That's a lot of firepower.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.511
Do we abort?

25:38.526 --> 25:42.024
S-Company could realize
Ethan's a spy at any moment,

25:42.089 --> 25:44.179
at which point
those men will turn on him.

25:46.316 --> 25:48.374
Go. Secure the asset.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.134
Riley, you got eyes?

26:09.199 --> 26:11.554
Just got behind
the building's security system.

26:12.189 --> 26:14.595
Ethan's entering the office
of a biotech firm

26:14.660 --> 26:15.696
on the fifth floor.

26:15.761 --> 26:17.421
Patching in the van now, Matty.

26:18.222 --> 26:19.657
Any idea what they're doing?

26:19.722 --> 26:21.235
Guessing they're here
to steal something, Mac.

26:21.300 --> 26:23.016
Oh, man, I'm wearing
this peashooter

26:23.081 --> 26:24.548
and we're about to get
into a gunfight

26:24.613 --> 26:26.135
with a bunch of guys
with automatic weapons?

26:26.200 --> 26:28.391
That is not gonna go well
for us... and I'm an optimist.

26:28.456 --> 26:29.488
Clearly.

26:29.566 --> 26:30.968
So, how are we doing this?

26:31.666 --> 26:33.149
If I can separate Ethan

26:33.214 --> 26:36.241
from his guys upstairs, can you take
care of the ones guarding the exits?

26:36.411 --> 26:38.488
Yeah, yeah,
I'm pretty sure I can clear you

26:38.553 --> 26:40.071
an escape route...
But how do you

26:40.136 --> 26:42.520
propose on doing
said separating?

26:42.585 --> 26:44.876
I got a plan,
but it kinda sorta hinges

26:44.941 --> 26:46.602
on Ethan actually wanting
to come with us.

26:46.667 --> 26:48.263
Kinda sorta?
That kinda sorta sounds

26:48.328 --> 26:49.854
like a terrible plan, man.

26:49.919 --> 26:52.074
I'm not super loving it, either,
but it's what we got.

26:52.449 --> 26:54.382
- I'll get out of here.
- Yeah.

27:13.055 --> 27:14.316
Nay.

27:14.394 --> 27:16.273
Merry Christmas
and congratulations.

27:16.338 --> 27:18.945
You've just won a free cruise
to the Bahamas,

27:19.049 --> 27:23.773
courtesy of...
Dragonfly Cruises.

27:25.620 --> 27:26.633
That's right.

27:26.698 --> 27:30.524
Dragonfly Cruises think
you deserve to get away.

27:30.589 --> 27:32.040
We're offering you a chance

27:32.105 --> 27:36.126
to escape all your troubles
at the end of the hall

27:36.191 --> 27:38.746
on a luxurious upper deck.

27:43.631 --> 27:45.015
Come on, Ethan.

28:10.465 --> 28:12.712
Don't move.
Don't move.

28:12.777 --> 28:14.113
Matty Webber sent me.

28:14.355 --> 28:16.376
S-Company knows there's
an undercover CIA agent

28:16.441 --> 28:18.074
in their ranks. It doesn't
matter what you've done

28:18.139 --> 28:19.259
or where your
allegiances lie.

28:19.324 --> 28:20.719
They will kill you when
they find out it's you.

28:20.784 --> 28:22.729
Nod if you understand.

28:27.988 --> 28:29.057
Good. Then you understand

28:29.122 --> 28:30.849
you have to come with me.

28:34.515 --> 28:36.446
All right, Jack,
asset's secure.

28:36.511 --> 28:38.306
Headed your way.
How's it looking down there?

28:38.678 --> 28:40.985
Shh...

28:42.138 --> 28:43.560
All right, good work, Mac.

28:43.649 --> 28:45.243
I'll have the building
perimeter clear

28:45.308 --> 28:47.031
by the time you hit the lobby.

28:48.529 --> 28:49.766
Riley, what was that?

28:49.831 --> 28:50.792
It's bad, Mac.

28:50.857 --> 28:51.996
The janitor just
accidentally walked

28:52.061 --> 28:53.835
in the middle
of S-Company's robbery.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.468
They're talking about
killing her.

28:58.152 --> 28:59.827
Mac, they're gonna
execute this woman

28:59.892 --> 29:01.266
right now;
you can't leave.

29:01.331 --> 29:03.100
If you do,
she dies.

29:04.582 --> 29:06.074
Take the stairs to the lobby.

29:06.139 --> 29:08.179
Our van's across the street.

29:32.995 --> 29:34.135
Come with me.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.584
Riley, the elevators.

29:53.091 --> 29:55.393
Tell Matty I'm sorry.

29:55.725 --> 29:57.051
MacGYVER:
Guys, Ethan's in trouble.

29:57.116 --> 29:58.731
He outed himself to save me.

29:58.796 --> 30:00.629
I don't have him.
Do you copy?

30:00.694 --> 30:02.448
All right, I got eyes on Ethan.

30:12.149 --> 30:15.027
I can't get close. These guys
are packing too much hardware.

30:15.092 --> 30:17.092
Matty, I'm so sorry.
I couldn't save them both.

30:17.157 --> 30:19.152
- I had to choose.
- Mac, we're past that now.

30:19.217 --> 30:20.785
We have to stop them
from taking Ethan,

30:20.850 --> 30:22.338
or they will kill him.

30:54.127 --> 30:55.903
Ethan, look out.

31:09.921 --> 31:12.643
- Ethan.
- Matty.

31:15.027 --> 31:16.645
There's so much to say.

31:16.710 --> 31:18.699
I'm so sorry,
there's no time.

31:19.116 --> 31:21.417
I need your help.
They're gonna kill my family.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.239
S-Company beat us here.

31:49.304 --> 31:50.489
You know, your
family could've made it out.

31:50.554 --> 31:52.231
No. They wouldn't run.
Deena knows to go right

31:52.296 --> 31:53.825
to the panic room
if anything happens.

31:53.890 --> 31:55.966
We'll go around back,
you guys take the front door.

31:56.031 --> 31:57.157
All right.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.620
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:26.722 --> 32:28.210
Hey, Bob Villa.

32:29.725 --> 32:31.538
Home improvements are over.

33:24.371 --> 33:25.941
Huh?

34:09.069 --> 34:10.628
Safe room's over here.

34:12.271 --> 34:14.106
- It won't open.
- Yeah, it took too much damage.

34:14.170 --> 34:16.121
That's not gonna work.
Just give me a second.

34:16.187 --> 34:17.926
Hang on. We're gonna
get you out, okay?

34:17.991 --> 34:19.629
- Daddy?
- I'm here, baby.

34:19.694 --> 34:21.176
We're gonna get
you out of there.

34:22.710 --> 34:24.792
Okay, Mac, what
are we doing here?

34:25.429 --> 34:27.848
Transferring energy
from this power drill

34:27.913 --> 34:30.239
into spreaders that'll have
enough mechanical energy

34:30.304 --> 34:32.130
to pry open this door.

34:32.196 --> 34:33.232
Yeah, if you say so.

34:48.978 --> 34:50.931
Daddy.

34:51.830 --> 34:55.138
- Hey, hey.
- Mm, mm. Are you okay?

34:55.688 --> 34:57.393
You okay?

35:25.364 --> 35:27.099
How long has it been?

35:28.774 --> 35:30.334
Almost an hour.

35:30.510 --> 35:32.154
Has Matty ever been late
for anything?

35:32.221 --> 35:35.249
No. No, but she's never had a
conversation like this before.

35:35.314 --> 35:36.461
I mean, she's about
to find out whether or not

35:36.526 --> 35:37.820
she still has a husband.

35:37.885 --> 35:39.490
Know what I mean?

35:39.590 --> 35:41.170
There she is.

35:43.142 --> 35:45.482
Mac. Can I talk to you?

35:47.449 --> 35:48.706
Yeah?

35:48.846 --> 35:51.398
Flying to Croatia,
you asked me how I kept my focus

35:51.463 --> 35:52.963
while Ethan was away.

35:53.799 --> 35:55.326
Here's my answer:

35:55.422 --> 35:57.835
the only thing
that makes all the sacrifices

35:57.900 --> 36:00.093
this job requires worthwhile
is knowing

36:00.158 --> 36:01.924
that I am helping
innocent people,

36:02.057 --> 36:03.834
saving innocent lives.

36:04.096 --> 36:06.458
What you did
in that office building,

36:06.656 --> 36:09.191
choosing to save
that woman,

36:09.375 --> 36:11.771
that was the right thing to do,
and I'm sorry,

36:11.836 --> 36:14.855
because I should have
said that sooner.

36:16.601 --> 36:18.086
Thanks.

36:45.590 --> 36:48.095
The agents who debriefed you
said you never stopped

36:48.160 --> 36:50.625
stockpiling intel
against S-Company.

36:50.871 --> 36:53.367
Even after you stopped
reporting back.

36:54.151 --> 36:56.618
That intel will help us
to strike some serious blows

36:56.683 --> 36:58.437
against the organization.

36:58.910 --> 37:00.496
Maybe even
give us a map

37:00.561 --> 37:02.579
into placing
another UC agent inside.

37:02.644 --> 37:05.609
Good. I'm glad.

37:27.458 --> 37:29.312
You look good, Matty.

37:30.287 --> 37:31.523
The new job,

37:31.619 --> 37:35.031
all of this,
I'm really proud of you.

37:36.550 --> 37:38.544
I love what I do.

37:44.056 --> 37:47.094
Ethan, what happened?

37:49.879 --> 37:53.419
You need to know
that I didn't plan any of this.

37:53.484 --> 37:54.790
Things got complicated.

37:54.855 --> 37:56.066
Wow.

37:56.144 --> 37:58.138
That's vague.

37:58.494 --> 38:00.160
Try again.

38:01.199 --> 38:05.226
At first,
I was just playing the role

38:05.452 --> 38:07.694
that was required
by the assignment.

38:07.759 --> 38:10.250
I did what was needed
to fit in with those men.

38:11.012 --> 38:13.601
Eventually,
I met Deena,

38:15.285 --> 38:17.190
and then our
daughter was born

38:17.488 --> 38:18.853
two years,
three months

38:18.918 --> 38:20.618
and 12 days ago.

38:20.683 --> 38:21.754
And after that,

38:21.819 --> 38:24.629
it became too dangerous
to contact my handler,

38:24.694 --> 38:26.695
so I just stopped.

38:26.865 --> 38:29.772
And then, all of a sudden,
the role that I was playing

38:29.843 --> 38:33.289
in order to survive long enough
to get back to you,

38:34.617 --> 38:37.789
it just became my life,
just like that.

38:38.920 --> 38:40.711
But I need you to know

38:40.891 --> 38:42.189
I never stopped loving you.

38:42.254 --> 38:44.726
Not for one day,
not for one second.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.905
And I'm so, so sorry.

38:52.741 --> 38:55.304
You have nothing
to apologize for.

38:55.629 --> 38:58.156
The direction
our lives took was

38:58.549 --> 39:01.312
as much my fault
as it is yours.

39:06.961 --> 39:08.332
Ethan?

39:11.836 --> 39:13.422
E, what's wrong?

39:15.137 --> 39:17.539
Ops director is sending me
to India.

39:17.698 --> 39:20.484
Non-official cover
in Mumbai for 12 months.

39:21.019 --> 39:22.275
You want to take it.

39:22.340 --> 39:24.242
I speak Marathi.

39:24.669 --> 39:27.300
And I ran that false flag
against Lashkar-e-Taiba

39:27.365 --> 39:28.961
last year and I got
an itch for it.

39:29.026 --> 39:31.150
Any way you look at it,
this is a career maker.

39:31.543 --> 39:33.947
And I could easily get
any chief of station job

39:34.012 --> 39:35.906
if I wanted, after this.

39:36.884 --> 39:38.098
But?

39:38.378 --> 39:39.988
But...

39:41.730 --> 39:43.445
four years ago,

39:43.617 --> 39:45.187
the best thing
that ever happened to me

39:45.252 --> 39:46.750
walked into my life.

39:46.957 --> 39:48.376
And I don't
want to put off

39:48.441 --> 39:50.244
having a family anymore.

39:51.566 --> 39:54.765
So I'm gonna tell the CIA
I'm done with deep cover.

39:57.888 --> 39:59.490
You can't turn down the job.

39:59.797 --> 40:00.962
Matty...

40:01.040 --> 40:03.992
Ethan, you're exceptionally good
at what you do.

40:04.072 --> 40:05.532
Better than anyone the Agency

40:05.597 --> 40:07.726
would send to Mumbai
in your place.

40:07.962 --> 40:09.706
So you're gonna
take the assignment.

40:09.818 --> 40:11.981
You're gonna do
whatever you have to do

40:12.149 --> 40:14.045
to stay safe,
to stay alive

40:14.522 --> 40:16.495
and then to come home to me.

40:17.164 --> 40:19.190
Then we'll pick up
where we left off.

40:20.396 --> 40:22.203
Are you sure about this?

40:23.530 --> 40:25.643
We have forever together.

40:25.865 --> 40:27.464
What's one year?

40:36.772 --> 40:38.165
Hmm.

40:39.127 --> 40:40.381
One second.

40:41.171 --> 40:42.194
Just wait.

40:47.358 --> 40:49.929
KC and The Sunshine Band.

40:49.994 --> 40:51.890
- Mm-hmm.
- Really?

40:51.955 --> 40:54.209
Who doesn't love
KC and The Sunshine Band?

40:54.293 --> 40:56.093
<i>♪ Shake, shake, shake ♪</i>

40:56.158 --> 40:57.695
<i>♪ Shake,
shake, shake ♪</i>

40:57.760 --> 40:59.721
<i>♪ Shake your booty ♪</i>

40:59.786 --> 41:01.881
<i>♪ Shake your booty... ♪</i>

41:06.235 --> 41:07.744
Go.

41:09.163 --> 41:10.982
You belong with them.

41:37.882 --> 41:40.145
So?

41:41.837 --> 41:44.887
He's going back
to his family.

41:48.215 --> 41:49.646
Well,
