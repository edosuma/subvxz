00:00.034 --> 00:01.583
I'm not good with mothers.

00:01.583 --> 00:02.754
- Bella?
- Denny?

00:02.754 --> 00:04.553
- You two know each other?
- She's yours.

00:04.553 --> 00:06.788
I'm gonna have to have a paternity test.

00:06.788 --> 00:09.583
Daniel died during a lung
transplant surgery in Brazil.

00:09.583 --> 00:11.811
What did I say about
not coming on too strongly?

00:11.811 --> 00:12.887
I thought you meant just with you.

00:12.887 --> 00:16.289
We're being sued for slander
by one of Jeffrey's red herrings
in the Scott Little trial.

00:16.289 --> 00:18.728
This will be an opportunity
for the two of you to bond.

00:18.728 --> 00:19.860
I'm damaged.

00:19.860 --> 00:22.047
You appear to be
a seriously disturbed man.

00:22.047 --> 00:24.298
You wrinkly old sack!

00:24.681 --> 00:27.692
Oops! I didn't see you there, judge.

ÀÚ¸·Á¦ÀÛ - NSC ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ
(http://club.nate.com/tsm)

00:37.918 --> 00:39.797
It's a simple paternity test.

00:39.797 --> 00:42.132
Why can't you just get
the results over the phone?

00:42.132 --> 00:44.277
I don't know.
Bethany wants to know in person.

00:44.277 --> 00:46.100
So does Bella, and they thought
I should be there.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.836
Okay, but why me?
Why should I...

00:47.836 --> 00:49.181
For support!

00:49.181 --> 00:52.235
For god's sakes, Alan, the midget
I am dating could be my daughter.

00:52.235 --> 00:54.410
It's not an easy time.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.458
This is Alan Shore.

01:00.458 --> 01:02.287
Alan, it's Jerry.

01:02.287 --> 01:03.859
I have a situation.

01:04.155 --> 01:05.158
Again?

01:05.158 --> 01:06.370
This one's not my doing.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.858
It's a client, and she may be
in serious trouble.

01:08.858 --> 01:10.804
She came over to go hiking
with her girlfriend.

01:10.804 --> 01:11.995
Friend didn't feel well,

01:11.995 --> 01:14.095
said she preferred to
just hang around the house.

01:14.095 --> 01:17.364
My client proceeded to go hiking
without her, then returned.

01:17.364 --> 01:21.061
There was her friend
hanging around the house,

01:21.061 --> 01:23.801
and when I say "hanging," Alan,

01:23.801 --> 01:26.042
I mean like a pinata.

01:26.362 --> 01:29.330
She's dead, Alan!
You need to come.

01:29.330 --> 01:30.876
Did you say "dead"?

01:31.150 --> 01:33.373
Jerry, have you called the police?

01:33.373 --> 01:35.526
She doesn't want that.
There are concerns, Alan.

01:35.526 --> 01:37.214
Aside from the fact her friend is dead,

01:37.214 --> 01:39.862
she's worried she may have done it.

01:39.862 --> 01:40.816
Done what?

01:40.816 --> 01:43.098
Hung her!
You need to come!

01:43.098 --> 01:44.639
Please hurry!

02:04.095 --> 02:05.031
Oh, my.

02:05.031 --> 02:08.375
Alan, this is Erica Dolenz.
Erica, Alan Shore.

02:08.375 --> 02:11.136
- Hello.
- Thank you for coming.

02:20.466 --> 02:23.514
Jerry said you were worried
you might have done this.

02:23.514 --> 02:25.537
It wasn't suicide.

02:25.889 --> 02:27.796
Her hands were tied.

02:28.053 --> 02:31.706
I untied them when I discovered
her in the hopes that...

02:32.218 --> 02:33.887
she was already dead.

02:34.102 --> 02:35.696
Her hands were tied?

02:35.696 --> 02:37.415
Behind her back.

02:40.933 --> 02:42.136
Okay.

02:42.560 --> 02:46.157
Why do you have concerns
that you may have...

02:46.157 --> 02:47.908
You can talk to him.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.497
I experienced some kind of a blackout.

02:51.497 --> 02:54.430
I, we argued when she didn't
want to go hiking.

02:54.430 --> 02:56.914
I remember going hiking
and coming back here,

02:56.914 --> 03:01.676
but I don't remember anything
between the hours of 10 and 12.

03:01.676 --> 03:05.676
Erica and I share the same psychiatrist.
We're friends of sorts.

03:05.676 --> 03:07.312
Don't tell Patty.

03:08.192 --> 03:09.261
All right.

03:09.261 --> 03:11.418
First thing we have to do here
is call the police.

03:11.418 --> 03:12.339
Why haven't you?

03:12.339 --> 03:15.548
I thought I should consult a lawyer first,
which is why I called Jerry.

03:15.548 --> 03:17.111
I wanted backup.

03:17.111 --> 03:19.365
This is my first hanging.

03:20.962 --> 03:25.661
Erica, before I pick up the phone,
is there anything else I need to know?

03:25.661 --> 03:30.587
Like? / Anything that could be
construed as relevant.

03:32.882 --> 03:34.748
Um...

03:35.823 --> 03:37.334
we were lovers.

03:38.660 --> 03:40.347
That would be relevant.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.186
You're not the father.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.244
- Thank you, god.
- Thank you, god.

04:34.606 --> 04:37.917
Well, shall we pick up where
we left off, my little friend?

04:38.217 --> 04:39.235
Forget it!

04:39.235 --> 04:40.045
Why?

04:40.045 --> 04:43.668
Because one of the rules
I try to follow in my social life

04:43.668 --> 04:47.737
is don't date guys
who have slept with my mother.

04:48.780 --> 04:50.132
Bethany...

04:50.683 --> 04:53.917
I never want to see you again!

05:04.542 --> 05:06.017
She's tough.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.856
Denny, if Bethany's out,

05:11.856 --> 05:14.843
I am hugely available.

05:18.423 --> 05:20.206
I don't mean to second-guess, Alan,

05:20.206 --> 05:21.874
but if we don't let her
give some statement,

05:21.874 --> 05:23.705
doesn't that automatically
make her suspicious?

05:23.705 --> 05:28.111
Jerry, she can't remember what she was doing 
for two hours prior to calling you.

05:28.111 --> 05:29.910
She cut rope off the victim's hands.

05:29.910 --> 05:32.131
She's officially suspicious.

05:33.006 --> 05:35.024
Where is the rope?

05:35.483 --> 05:36.469
In the trash.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.062
Which they'll undoubtedly find.

05:38.062 --> 05:40.612
All in all, better she say nothing,

05:40.612 --> 05:44.350
in which case, you can expect
some sort of detainment.

05:44.350 --> 05:46.825
Excuse me, ma'am?
This is a crime scene.

05:46.825 --> 05:49.734
This is my lover.
I would like to say good-bye.

05:49.734 --> 05:51.885
You and the deceased were involved?

05:51.885 --> 05:54.962
Deeply.
I would like to say good-bye.

05:56.838 --> 05:58.394
Okay.

06:02.901 --> 06:04.651
Good-bye.

06:07.165 --> 06:08.623
Hello.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.670
I'm told the official statement
from authorities

06:27.670 --> 06:31.044
is naming a suspect at this point
would be premature.

06:31.044 --> 06:34.204
Oh, come on.
You've got to be kidding me.

06:34.204 --> 06:36.802
The judge kicks the case

06:36.802 --> 06:41.894
then this fruitcake Lincoln Meyer
declares right in open court,

06:41.894 --> 06:44.151
"you wrinkly old sack!"

06:44.151 --> 06:46.548
Cut to three hours later,

06:46.548 --> 06:48.967
the judge is found dead
in the parking lot

06:48.967 --> 06:50.878
with a dent in the back of his head.

06:50.878 --> 06:55.158
Are the police questioning
this sex-perv wackadoo?

06:55.158 --> 06:57.163
Hello? Anybody home?

06:57.163 --> 07:01.775
Knock, knock, it's a killer at the door,
and his name is Lincoln Meyer.

07:17.223 --> 07:20.624
I got your memo
on the abstention doctrine.

07:20.624 --> 07:23.094
It, it really stinks.

07:23.862 --> 07:26.076
Denise, do you want to take some time?

07:26.076 --> 07:28.510
No, I, I don't dare.

07:28.510 --> 07:30.298
Are you okay?

07:31.070 --> 07:34.273
It's just that
ever since Daniel died, I...

07:35.026 --> 07:37.201
- all I can think about is...
- Hmm, yeah.

07:37.201 --> 07:38.515
sex.

07:38.515 --> 07:41.050
I walk down the street,
anything I pass in pants,

07:41.050 --> 07:43.150
I want to have sex.

07:43.150 --> 07:44.586
I'm not kidding, Shirley.

07:44.586 --> 07:47.963
I want to screw anybody and everybody.

07:47.963 --> 07:51.435
Denny Crane is looking good
to me right now.

07:57.612 --> 07:58.905
I'm being arrested?

07:58.905 --> 08:00.927
I want to surrender you myself, Erica,

08:00.927 --> 08:02.780
so they can't parade you past the media

08:02.780 --> 08:05.155
as they shove you into
the back of a patrol car.

08:05.155 --> 08:06.552
I'll be dragged into court?

08:06.552 --> 08:09.065
Your arraignment's this afternoon.

08:09.065 --> 08:10.516
This is horrible.

08:10.516 --> 08:14.778
Erica, let's talk a little about your
relationship with the victim Paula Wilkes.

08:14.778 --> 08:18.065
Blessed are they who are merciful,
for they will be shown mercy.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.258
Blessed are they who mourn...

08:19.258 --> 08:21.786
With all due respect to the Beatitudes,

08:21.786 --> 08:23.851
was she your lover?

08:23.851 --> 08:24.755
Yes.

08:24.755 --> 08:27.124
Then she recently left you.

08:27.124 --> 08:30.665
Yes, for that woman.

08:30.665 --> 08:36.234
Then how is it you were still supposed
to go hiking with Paula?

08:36.234 --> 08:38.402
We were trying to be amicable.

08:38.402 --> 08:40.340
But when I came over,

08:40.340 --> 08:43.288
under the pretext of normalcy,
to continue our hiking routine,

08:43.288 --> 08:45.827
she suddenly didn't feel well and...

08:46.508 --> 08:49.927
Jerry said you take some medication for...

08:49.927 --> 08:53.631
A mild, non-bizarre delusional disorder.

08:53.631 --> 08:55.312
Sometimes I hear voices.

08:55.312 --> 08:57.971
- Have you heard any lately?
- No.

09:02.565 --> 09:06.772
Erica, your last memory
before you blacked out,

09:06.772 --> 09:11.840
it was a fight with Paula because she
didn't want to go hiking with you?

09:11.840 --> 09:13.602
Yes.

09:15.849 --> 09:18.932
I could never hang a person, Mr. Shore.

09:19.735 --> 09:21.583
I could never be violent.

09:21.583 --> 09:26.422
But the last thing you remember
was being angry at her?

09:28.363 --> 09:29.948
Very.

09:36.008 --> 09:38.845
- He wants to see me?
- Evidently.

09:38.845 --> 09:39.929
Do I know him?

09:39.929 --> 09:42.856
No, but you're going to love him.

09:43.312 --> 09:45.657
Lincoln, how are you?

09:45.657 --> 09:48.893
Truth be told, my little cup
runneth over with rancor.

09:48.893 --> 09:50.422
This judge that was killed,

09:50.422 --> 09:53.361
that Gracie Jane woman is saying
perhaps that I did it.

09:53.361 --> 09:55.382
She's damaging my good name.

09:55.382 --> 09:56.669
Add to that,

09:56.669 --> 09:59.042
the police want me to come down
and make some sort of statement,

09:59.042 --> 10:00.714
and I don't like their tenor.

10:00.714 --> 10:02.391
One week I'm their big cog.

10:02.391 --> 10:04.797
The next they're speaking to me
with a tenor.

10:04.797 --> 10:06.599
They think you killed judge Potts?

10:06.599 --> 10:10.507
That tub-of-guts reporter's got
them all bloated with suspicion.

10:10.507 --> 10:12.130
He's a fairy.

10:12.130 --> 10:13.698
What do you want, Lincoln?

10:13.698 --> 10:17.086
Why, I want Denny Crane
to be my lawyer, of course.

10:17.086 --> 10:20.854
I don't want to be implicated
in the murder of that wrinkly old sack.

10:20.854 --> 10:25.155
And I should like a name partner
to do my bidding.

10:25.510 --> 10:28.556
Seriously, he's a total fairy.

10:30.509 --> 10:32.446
We'll all go to court together?

10:32.712 --> 10:33.517
Yes.

10:33.517 --> 10:35.565
And they'll lock me up?

10:35.565 --> 10:37.901
I'm hoping that won't happen.

10:38.188 --> 10:40.411
Erica, could you give me
two minutes with Jerry,

10:40.411 --> 10:42.129
and we'll be right out?

10:42.129 --> 10:43.457
Oh, okay.

10:54.551 --> 10:56.893
I'd like you to handle the arraignment.

10:56.893 --> 10:57.722
Me?

10:57.722 --> 10:59.927
I think you can first-chair, Jerry.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.788
The client has a trust with you.
But...

11:02.788 --> 11:04.837
I can do it. I can do it.

11:04.837 --> 11:07.968
Jerry, if you can't, just say so,

11:07.968 --> 11:09.600
because this is
a first degree murder case.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.024
- I can do it. I want to.
- Look at me.

11:12.024 --> 11:14.234
We need to get bail.

11:14.234 --> 11:17.262
This woman does not strike me
as a person who will do well in custody.

11:17.262 --> 11:19.879
Okay. / Which means you have to
take charge in the courtroom.

11:19.879 --> 11:23.152
Keep the hops and squeals
to a minimum and focus.

11:23.152 --> 11:24.714
If Erica gets locked up,

11:24.714 --> 11:28.478
it will be very, very bad.

11:29.310 --> 11:32.925
Okay, I can do it.

11:41.109 --> 11:42.973
Shirley, hello.

11:42.973 --> 11:45.121
What a smart outfit.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.977
I always say it's a very good
statement for a law firm

11:47.977 --> 11:50.521
when the name partner's
a smart dresser.

11:50.521 --> 11:51.813
What are you doing here, Lincoln?

11:51.813 --> 11:53.091
Why, I'm a client.

11:53.091 --> 11:55.426
Denny Crane has decided
to be my lawyer.

11:55.426 --> 11:56.921
Denny Crane is representing you?

11:56.921 --> 11:59.483
I'm not talking to you, Mr. Dirty mouth.

11:59.483 --> 12:03.594
I expect to be on the client list
and invited to all the office parties.

12:03.594 --> 12:08.190
You and I can dance, Shirley,
get on with our special friendship.

12:08.190 --> 12:09.431
All set?

12:10.802 --> 12:13.068
Denny, are you really
reprenting this man?

12:13.068 --> 12:14.950
Potential murder case, Shirley.

12:14.950 --> 12:17.438
Denny Crane, back in the saddle.

12:17.438 --> 12:19.193
You're repping him, too?

12:19.193 --> 12:20.096
Why not?

12:20.096 --> 12:22.442
I'd love for you to join, Shirley Schmidt.

12:22.442 --> 12:23.476
Pass.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.396
That's a mistake.

12:27.718 --> 12:28.849
What the hell was that?

12:28.849 --> 12:30.054
Word is you're a serial dater.

12:30.054 --> 12:32.366
Claire's afraid her number might be up.

12:32.366 --> 12:35.660
I realize we haven't actually met,
but I don't like you.

12:35.660 --> 12:38.182
Aren't you a little pepper pot?

12:49.221 --> 12:50.777
Big murder case, I hear.

12:50.777 --> 12:53.986
Yes, I'm off to the arraignment now.

12:54.578 --> 13:00.584
Denise, I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation with Shirley.

13:00.584 --> 13:05.451
I happen to know sometimes grief
can trigger the libido.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.059
It's got something to do with death

13:08.059 --> 13:11.749
causing a biological need
to propagate the species.

13:11.749 --> 13:16.108
Evidently, after 9/11,
people were running around like rabbits.

13:16.108 --> 13:18.678
Really? I did not know that.

13:18.678 --> 13:22.344
If I could ever be of service,

13:22.344 --> 13:24.687
to help you cope...

13:34.824 --> 13:37.163
You left the courthouse
and then did what?

13:37.163 --> 13:40.379
I returned to my house,
made some notes for my appeal,

13:40.379 --> 13:43.594
had dinner and watched the ball game.

13:43.594 --> 13:46.371
- The ball game?
- Yes, the ball game,

13:46.371 --> 13:49.322
the one where one man throws a ball,

13:49.322 --> 13:53.190
and the other swats at it
with a slab of wood.

13:53.190 --> 13:54.248
Baseball.

13:54.248 --> 13:56.063
Baseball, that's it.

13:56.063 --> 13:57.969
I love baseball.

13:57.969 --> 13:58.930
Who was playing?

13:58.930 --> 14:02.286
I haven't the slightest.
I'm not into who plays or wins.

14:02.286 --> 14:04.422
I just enjoy the sport.

14:04.422 --> 14:05.777
I'm a purist.

14:05.777 --> 14:07.361
What's the infield fly rule?

14:07.361 --> 14:09.057
I haven't the slightest.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.757
Does it involve a zipper?

14:10.757 --> 14:13.357
I bet he's more familiar with a zipper
than he is with baseball.

14:13.357 --> 14:15.571
Really? / We're gonna ask you to be
a part of a lineup.

14:15.571 --> 14:16.877
Oh, how fun!

14:16.877 --> 14:18.623
What position do I get to play?

14:18.623 --> 14:20.717
Not a baseball lineup,
a police lineup.

14:20.717 --> 14:22.425
A police lineup?

14:22.425 --> 14:25.559
Do I get to hold one of those
little sticks the policemen have

14:25.559 --> 14:28.506
and swing it with great force?

14:28.798 --> 14:31.850
It's like he wants to be arrested.

14:31.850 --> 14:32.760
You should have seen him.

14:32.760 --> 14:36.591
I think he's one of those weird
liberal Democrats

14:36.591 --> 14:39.373
who's a closet Republican.

14:39.373 --> 14:41.559
Denny, can we talk?

14:41.559 --> 14:43.399
We're talking.

14:44.253 --> 14:46.031
I must admit,

14:46.031 --> 14:49.556
part of me is devastated
you're not the father.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.903
I always thought you were.

14:51.903 --> 14:55.410
You never sought child support.

14:55.679 --> 14:58.466
I didn't really want contact with you.

14:58.466 --> 15:00.134
I mean, I did,

15:00.134 --> 15:03.804
but once you married...

15:04.686 --> 15:08.417
Denny, our breakup was
very painful for me.

15:08.417 --> 15:11.026
Me, too. 12 stitches.

15:11.939 --> 15:15.403
You took six stitches when we first
got together, remember?

15:15.403 --> 15:19.253
I tackled you like a linebacker
when you refused to go out with me.

15:19.253 --> 15:20.613
You hit me from behind.

15:20.613 --> 15:22.421
You loved it.

15:22.876 --> 15:28.976
Denny, if Bethany is serious about
having nothing further to do with you,

15:29.221 --> 15:31.642
I'm serious.

15:31.855 --> 15:35.685
How out having something
to do with me again?

15:35.685 --> 15:38.568
You and I were a long time ago, Bella.

15:38.568 --> 15:42.059
I'm still the same woman
you fell in love with,

15:42.059 --> 15:45.014
the same passionate woman.

15:45.300 --> 15:48.935
Of course, I'm not looking
to steal my daughter's boyfriend,

15:48.935 --> 15:53.860
but if you and Bethany are really over,

15:54.242 --> 15:57.928
I want to do things to you...

15:58.585 --> 16:00.181
again.

16:04.267 --> 16:08.117
Case 936642,
commonwealth vs. Erica Dolenz.

16:08.117 --> 16:10.371
Charge is murder in the first degree.

16:10.371 --> 16:11.425
You can do it.

16:11.425 --> 16:12.376
You can do it.

16:12.557 --> 16:13.596
You can do it.

16:13.596 --> 16:14.824
- Jerry.
- Yes?

16:14.824 --> 16:16.322
Do it now.

16:16.322 --> 16:18.998
Jerry Espenson appearing for
the defendant Erica Dolenz.

16:18.998 --> 16:21.496
Hello? Hello?

16:21.496 --> 16:27.445
We will waive the remainder of the reading
and promptly enter a plea of not guilty.

16:27.733 --> 16:29.621
I would like to point out
to the court at this time

16:29.621 --> 16:31.787
that my client has no criminal record

16:31.787 --> 16:35.702
and she has strong roots in the community
and does not pose a flight risk.

16:35.702 --> 16:38.175
Moreover, she is under a doctor's care,

16:38.175 --> 16:42.039
for which treatment remains essential,
not only for her well being,

16:42.039 --> 16:45.656
but also to enable her to adequately
contribute to her own defense.

16:45.656 --> 16:49.622
I would therefore implore this court
to release her on her own recognizance.

16:49.622 --> 16:51.117
This is a first degree murder.

16:51.117 --> 16:53.376
For which my client is presumed innocent.

16:53.376 --> 16:55.458
I would remind the court
of my client's record,

16:55.458 --> 16:56.579
of which there is none,

16:56.579 --> 16:59.559
and her roots of which there are many.

16:59.559 --> 17:02.333
$1 million bond, $100,000 cash.

17:02.333 --> 17:04.465
Thank you very much, your honor.

17:04.465 --> 17:07.234
We'll arrange for bail.
In the meantime, speak to no one.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.440
Okay.

17:09.077 --> 17:11.310
Jerry, that was fantastic.

17:11.310 --> 17:13.233
Are you taking something?

17:20.881 --> 17:24.275
But let's take away
all the glaring evidence...

17:24.275 --> 17:26.766
You're really gonna let him
try the case?

17:26.766 --> 17:28.589
With my supervision.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.432
Don't forget, Denny,
Jerry happens to be a genius.

17:31.432 --> 17:35.342
And if he's gay,
he's guilty of something.

17:35.342 --> 17:40.542
Am I the only one with enough guts
to say these people are sickos?

17:40.542 --> 17:44.428
I mean, surely somebody else
out there figured out that.

17:44.428 --> 17:46.919
If he won't follow the laws of nature,

17:46.919 --> 17:50.277
what are the chances he'll
follow the laws of society?

17:50.277 --> 17:51.498
Bottom line,

17:51.498 --> 17:55.621
perv in the bedroom,
perv in the world at large.

17:57.206 --> 18:00.989
This is all because I didn't
satisfy her in bed.

18:04.297 --> 18:06.613
May we speak in private, please?

18:06.613 --> 18:09.449
Anything you have to say,
you can say in front of him.

18:09.449 --> 18:11.400
We're married.

18:15.066 --> 18:17.242
I can get by that you're old.

18:17.242 --> 18:20.588
I can get by that
you're old and gross.

18:20.588 --> 18:25.363
But I just can't get by that you've
had a history with my very own mother.

18:25.363 --> 18:27.988
That was a different lifetime, Bethany.

18:27.988 --> 18:29.725
Don't you see, Denny?

18:29.725 --> 18:32.427
She cultivated my attraction for you.

18:32.427 --> 18:34.894
She'd talk about you all the time,

18:34.894 --> 18:38.619
leaving out the part
that you and she were engaged.

18:38.619 --> 18:41.247
It's all very unhealthy.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.192
See, Bethany...

18:48.888 --> 18:50.683
one thing about getting old,

18:50.683 --> 18:54.679
a little wisdom has to sink in
along the way.

18:54.679 --> 18:58.185
There are a lot of reasons
not to go out with anybody,

18:58.185 --> 19:01.986
but there is only one reason
to go out with somebody.

19:05.410 --> 19:09.672
(Point to your heart)
This baby right here.

19:09.672 --> 19:12.020
What's this telling you?

19:23.108 --> 19:25.484
If they're trying to provoke a confrontation,
they're gonna get one.

19:25.484 --> 19:28.121
I am this close to laying him
out on his ass.

19:28.121 --> 19:32.243
And I'll drop Claire, too,
snide little bitch.

19:32.461 --> 19:35.435
Brad, could it be that
the hostility started with you?

19:35.435 --> 19:36.436
Brad's right, Denise.

19:36.436 --> 19:39.562
These new people haven't
shown us our propers,

19:39.562 --> 19:42.437
especially Jeffrey Coho.
He's got to go.

19:42.437 --> 19:44.388
Are you mocking me?
Because I'll deck you, too.

19:44.388 --> 19:46.361
I'm not mocking you at all.

19:46.361 --> 19:50.881
You and I, Brad, we have to find
a way to get the new guy. Are you in?

19:51.221 --> 19:53.171
Absolutely.

19:53.830 --> 19:55.769
We'll make a plan.

19:55.769 --> 19:58.196
Could I have a minute
in private with Denise?

19:58.196 --> 19:59.701
Sure.

20:04.218 --> 20:05.677
What's up, Alan?

20:05.677 --> 20:09.408
I'd just like to apologize
for my remarks earlier.

20:09.408 --> 20:11.823
Given everything you're going through,

20:11.823 --> 20:15.319
I feel I should have been
much more explicit.

20:17.390 --> 20:18.985
Good night, Alan.

20:19.256 --> 20:22.294
Denise, you've always struck me
as a woman

20:22.294 --> 20:26.788
who secretly longs to be debased.

20:26.788 --> 20:29.873
It's an awfully big job,

20:29.873 --> 20:32.837
but I feel I'm just the man to...

20:32.837 --> 20:34.733
do it.

20:34.936 --> 20:36.342
Don't stop.

20:36.342 --> 20:39.205
I'm curious to see
just how low you'll go.

20:39.205 --> 20:43.413
All the way down, again and again.

20:43.413 --> 20:48.194
I see the filthy, naughty girl
deep inside you, Denise,

20:48.194 --> 20:50.306
longing to get out.

20:50.306 --> 20:53.892
Now if you're so unwilling
to let her out,

20:53.892 --> 20:57.373
perhaps I should go in after her.

20:57.373 --> 20:59.812
I brought my snorkel.

21:05.110 --> 21:07.175
Take off your pants, Denise.

21:10.124 --> 21:11.619
Get out.

21:14.216 --> 21:16.596
Let me see you underwear, Denise.

21:22.260 --> 21:23.863
Get out.

21:37.340 --> 21:39.294
It just seems wrong, Bella.

21:39.294 --> 21:45.057
Denny, Bethany swears to me
she's not interested in you anymore.

21:45.057 --> 21:46.577
It doesn't feel right.

21:46.577 --> 21:49.755
It didn't feel right to you 35 years ago

21:49.755 --> 21:54.419
until suddenly it was love
at first tackle.

21:54.419 --> 21:57.152
The answer's no.

21:57.152 --> 21:58.966
What are you gonna do?

21:58.966 --> 22:02.053
Go back to one of
your skinny little models?

22:02.053 --> 22:07.434
Have you forgotten the joy
of a full-bodied woman?

22:08.265 --> 22:10.973
Think back to how I'd flatten you.

22:10.973 --> 22:13.846
Hello. Ready for my lineup?

22:13.846 --> 22:16.884
Hello. Lincoln Meyer.

22:16.884 --> 22:19.930
I'm a suspect in judge Potts' murder.

22:19.930 --> 22:23.514
My, aren't you a showstopper?

22:24.394 --> 22:26.677
She's drawn to me.

22:30.245 --> 22:32.703
The security camera shows you
going in at 10:27.

22:32.703 --> 22:34.475
You called Jerry at 12:14.

22:34.475 --> 22:37.722
That's almost two hours
which would be unaccounted for.

22:37.722 --> 22:39.137
That would be my blackout.

22:39.137 --> 22:42.464
It also shows her ex-husband
going into the building at 10:06,

22:42.464 --> 22:44.784
leaving at 10:10, 4 minutes later.

22:44.784 --> 22:47.352
He's also agreed to come in.
Jerry, I want you to speak with him.

22:47.352 --> 22:50.093
I'll talk to the new girlfriend,
who's also agreed to meet me here.

22:50.093 --> 22:53.381
- I can't face that woman.
- You won't have to.

22:53.381 --> 22:57.659
Erica, we'd also like to speak
with your treating psychiatrist,

22:57.659 --> 23:00.953
learn what we can about your blackouts.

23:01.287 --> 23:02.400
Excuse me.

23:03.989 --> 23:09.107
I just wanted to tell you that what you
said to me last night was truly...

23:09.107 --> 23:10.929
disgusting.

23:11.837 --> 23:15.739
And I assure you, Denise,
I'm a man of my word.

23:27.391 --> 23:28.363
Set?

23:28.363 --> 23:29.583
All set.

23:31.942 --> 23:33.433
Bring them in, please.

23:37.590 --> 23:39.823
Stand facing front, please.

23:44.496 --> 23:46.025
Turn to your left.

23:48.534 --> 23:50.797
Stand facing forward again.

23:55.155 --> 23:56.983
Turn to the right.

23:59.728 --> 24:00.629
I'm sorry.

24:00.629 --> 24:03.366
None of these are the man
I saw in the parking lot.

24:03.909 --> 24:05.466
You sure?

24:06.920 --> 24:08.493
I'm positive.

24:13.304 --> 24:14.692
He didn't pick me?

24:14.692 --> 24:16.702
What do I have to do, kill somebody?

24:16.702 --> 24:18.058
Oh, try to cope.

24:18.058 --> 24:19.454
So what happens now?

24:19.454 --> 24:21.072
You said I'd like him.

24:21.072 --> 24:24.604
He's an attention-starved wacko fairy.
He couldn't kill anyone.

24:24.604 --> 24:26.609
I heard that.

24:26.609 --> 24:30.008
I'm getting tired of you, large marge.

24:30.008 --> 24:34.277
You remind me of Mr. Dirty mouth.
That's what you do.

24:44.229 --> 24:47.808
I went to her apartment
around 10 o'clock or so.

24:47.808 --> 24:50.022
Well, I'm not sure of the exact time.

24:50.022 --> 24:52.791
May I ask why you went there?

24:52.791 --> 24:54.080
Well, if you must know,

24:54.080 --> 24:57.936
I was there to persuade her
to take me back.

24:57.936 --> 25:01.180
Anyway, she didn't come
to the door, so I left.

25:01.180 --> 25:04.755
The next thing, the police call me,
and they tell me that she's...

25:05.582 --> 25:07.457
May I ask, sir?

25:07.457 --> 25:10.466
Though the police seem
to be ruling out suicide,

25:10.466 --> 25:13.701
there's some evidence your wife...

25:13.912 --> 25:18.017
ex-wife was having some depression.

25:18.510 --> 25:21.233
The breakup of our family
caused her a lot of pain.

25:21.233 --> 25:24.297
We have children. But...

25:24.297 --> 25:28.819
Paula was not suicidal.
I mean, there is no way. I, I...

25:30.363 --> 25:34.469
I can't believe that she would do...

25:35.664 --> 25:37.266
that.

25:42.158 --> 25:43.239
Brad.

25:44.021 --> 25:45.571
Jeff.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.493
Bit of a weak stream
you've got going there.

25:49.493 --> 25:51.486
You had your prostate checked?

25:51.486 --> 25:54.027
- What did you say to me?
- Never mind.

25:58.458 --> 26:01.164
So what, you're gonna
make fun of my flow now?

26:01.164 --> 26:03.159
Oh, I'm sorry.
It just seemed a little lackluster.

26:03.159 --> 26:06.652
I would think an ex-marine would
be a little more "hup two!"

26:09.428 --> 26:10.674
You gonna hit me, Brad?

26:10.674 --> 26:12.290
Oh, you would just love that,
wouldn't you?

26:12.290 --> 26:14.310
For me to sink to your level.

26:17.465 --> 26:18.942
Impressive.

26:19.447 --> 26:21.195
- May I respond?
- Please.

26:26.649 --> 26:28.543
- Is that it?
- That's it.

26:29.430 --> 26:32.139
I take it back.
Evidently, there was more.

26:32.979 --> 26:36.250
So are we going to take this
to the next level?

26:36.250 --> 26:38.799
What's that, sex?
You'll send me flowers first.

26:38.799 --> 26:40.111
That didn't hurt.

26:41.517 --> 26:42.743
That did.

26:56.353 --> 26:58.198
Jeez! What the...

26:58.814 --> 27:00.053
Come on.

27:02.180 --> 27:04.328
No, no, stop that!

27:04.328 --> 27:05.517
Stop that now!

27:05.517 --> 27:07.460
Stop that! Stop it now!

27:15.230 --> 27:17.928
You are grown men, for god's sake!

27:17.928 --> 27:18.956
And lawyers.

27:18.956 --> 27:21.123
Ever since I got here,
he's wanted a piece of me.

27:21.123 --> 27:22.575
And I got it, too, sport.

27:22.575 --> 27:23.768
All right!

27:23.768 --> 27:26.713
What is this really about?

27:26.994 --> 27:28.410
I don't like him.

27:28.410 --> 27:31.243
Somebody needs to beat the crap
out of him and it might as well be me.

27:31.243 --> 27:32.850
- Too bad you can't.
- You don't think so?

27:32.850 --> 27:34.793
- You want to take it outside? 
- Let's go.

27:34.793 --> 27:36.213
Hey! Hey!

27:37.248 --> 27:38.511
Sit!

27:40.051 --> 27:43.704
Thank you so much for coming in
to speak with me.

27:44.685 --> 27:49.596
And please accept my condolences
for your loss.

27:49.596 --> 27:51.060
Thank you.

27:55.765 --> 27:59.350
How long were you and
Ms. Wilkes together?

27:59.350 --> 28:01.325
Three weeks.

28:01.591 --> 28:04.073
- We were in love.
- In love.

28:04.073 --> 28:06.526
I will never get over her.

28:08.144 --> 28:10.552
What did you love about her
if I may ask?

28:10.552 --> 28:14.560
She was pretty with pleasing personality.

28:18.405 --> 28:21.487
What do you think Ms. Wilkes
love most about you?

28:21.487 --> 28:23.551
I made her laugh.

28:25.313 --> 28:26.658
You made her laugh.

28:26.658 --> 28:28.343
I'm funny.

28:31.976 --> 28:38.481
Can you tell me about her mood
in the days before her death?

28:38.481 --> 28:39.899
She seemed sad.

28:39.899 --> 28:41.111
Sad. / Sad.

28:41.111 --> 28:43.735
- How sad?
- Yes.

28:44.064 --> 28:45.071
Sorry?

28:45.071 --> 28:47.540
You said, "how sad",
I agreed how sad.

28:47.540 --> 28:49.317
No, no. I was...

28:49.317 --> 28:57.164
I was inquiring as to the extent
of her sadness, how sad.

29:05.745 --> 29:08.718
Did she ever...

29:09.097 --> 29:11.818
talk of taking her life?

29:11.818 --> 29:13.631
Once.

29:14.592 --> 29:16.694
It was sad.

29:21.365 --> 29:24.213
She's very odd, Jerry.

29:24.213 --> 29:26.372
Let's do an immediate
background check on her.

29:26.372 --> 29:27.410
Okay, okay.

29:27.410 --> 29:29.842
- What about your psychiatrist?
- He's coming in.

29:29.842 --> 29:31.889
I also made an appointment
with her probate lawyer.

29:31.889 --> 29:34.097
She's agreed to let us
review Paula's will.

29:34.097 --> 29:35.314
Can I play?

29:35.314 --> 29:37.123
Denny, you have your own murder case.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.582
He didn't do it.

29:38.582 --> 29:41.285
He lied to me.
He was cleared.

29:41.485 --> 29:42.569
Can I play?

29:44.945 --> 29:46.385
I'm okay.

29:52.024 --> 29:54.274
When you came here,
I made one request, Jeffrey,

29:54.274 --> 29:56.889
one simple request,
"don't step on toes."

29:56.889 --> 29:59.188
Silly me for not adding
"don't punch jaws."

29:59.188 --> 30:01.006
You also made promises, Shirley,

30:01.006 --> 30:02.760
one being this place would accept me.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.859
I said "eventually,"

30:03.859 --> 30:05.076
- as long as you didn't piss on...
- What's eventually?

30:05.076 --> 30:07.061
Just this side of never? / Everybody's turf,
which is exactly what you did.

30:07.061 --> 30:09.003
As soon as I got here,
I was thrown into a murder trial.

30:09.003 --> 30:10.472
No, you poached that trial.

30:10.472 --> 30:11.924
There's been a massive
amount of pressure.

30:11.924 --> 30:12.944
Which you typically feed on.

30:12.944 --> 30:17.280
And no one to offer any
support whatsoever, not even you.

30:18.519 --> 30:19.772
Okay.

30:19.772 --> 30:22.425
So we all have a little healing to do.

30:22.425 --> 30:24.055
I'm not looking for your sympathy.

30:24.055 --> 30:27.024
- So much as?
- Dinner.

30:27.728 --> 30:30.350
Last time you and I had dinner,
it turned out to be a terrible idea.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.143
Not for me.

30:32.506 --> 30:34.126
I am a senior partner here.

30:34.126 --> 30:36.628
You say that as if it will get you laid.

30:36.628 --> 30:38.738
It will.

30:42.241 --> 30:45.201
I am significantly older than you.

30:45.201 --> 30:46.567
Fine.

30:47.115 --> 30:50.958
Then be my significant older other.

30:51.614 --> 30:56.376
Why do you think I came
to Boston, Shirley, the Red sox?

31:01.984 --> 31:05.916
The blackout was basically
a psychological form of amnesia.

31:05.916 --> 31:08.152
- Is this common?
- Somewhat.

31:08.152 --> 31:09.819
The sight of seeing a loved one hanging,

31:09.819 --> 31:13.291
a blackout can almost serve
as a psychological defense of sorts.

31:13.291 --> 31:16.243
Will her memory come bald?

31:16.561 --> 31:18.397
I meant to say "back."

31:18.397 --> 31:19.598
It could.

31:19.598 --> 31:21.108
But I must tell you,

31:21.108 --> 31:23.736
her memory loss could have been
triggered by something else,

31:23.736 --> 31:26.499
something I'm afraid
which is medically more common.

31:26.499 --> 31:28.040
What?

31:28.422 --> 31:31.054
Well, some people block out
things they have done

31:31.054 --> 31:35.965
because they cannot reconcile
the act with who they are.

31:35.965 --> 31:38.248
Which do you think this is?

31:38.248 --> 31:41.365
Really, I can't see Erica
hanging somebody.

31:41.365 --> 31:43.524
It's a particularly cruel way
to kill somebody.

31:43.524 --> 31:45.230
It's loaded with hate,

31:45.230 --> 31:48.081
maybe even an affinity for torture,

31:48.081 --> 31:50.491
and that simply is not
the Erica that I know.

31:50.491 --> 31:51.580
But?

31:51.580 --> 31:55.531
But one of the reasons
I first started to treat her, when...

31:56.137 --> 31:59.212
she got angry,

31:59.212 --> 32:02.657
the voices she would hear
would tell her to do things.

32:02.657 --> 32:08.278
Her voices have told her
to do violent things before?

32:09.133 --> 32:10.571
Yes.

32:15.178 --> 32:17.837
Don't tell me there's no story.

32:17.837 --> 32:23.662
There's never a story, Walter,
unless I make it one.

32:24.011 --> 32:26.834
I'm not going down to Aruba again.

32:26.834 --> 32:29.624
If there's no arrest with Lincoln Meyer,

32:29.624 --> 32:33.182
I'll focus on the dead lesbian,
for god's sake.

32:33.182 --> 32:35.548
You saying I can't sell that?

32:35.548 --> 32:37.652
Yeah, I'll do what I do.

32:37.652 --> 32:41.268
Meantime, find me a missing baby.
It's Sweeps for god's sake.

32:45.379 --> 32:46.725
Oops.

32:47.690 --> 32:49.698
I didn't see you there.

32:59.955 --> 33:05.058
Next, we go see Paula's lawyer
to see who inherits under her will.

33:05.278 --> 33:07.448
It isn't you, is it?

33:08.068 --> 33:10.526
Do I inherit under her will?

33:10.526 --> 33:12.700
I hardly think so.

33:14.485 --> 33:16.741
Is that why I'm a suspect?

33:16.741 --> 33:18.312
No, but...

33:18.312 --> 33:20.379
But what?

33:21.120 --> 33:23.125
Uh, I don't like the sound of that.

33:23.125 --> 33:26.257
The big problem, Erica,

33:27.428 --> 33:29.627
assuming somebody else did this,

33:29.627 --> 33:34.660
why would he or she leave the hands tied
for you to discover the body that way?

33:34.660 --> 33:40.152
The tied hands clearly
rule out suicide.

33:40.507 --> 33:42.181
Well...

33:42.181 --> 33:44.999
if this was such a crime of hatred,

33:44.999 --> 33:48.440
maybe the killer made no attempt
to pull it off as a suicide.

33:48.440 --> 33:53.054
Maybe he or she was making a point.

33:53.710 --> 33:55.176
What?

33:55.375 --> 33:56.494
You don't believe me?

33:56.494 --> 33:58.231
It's not that I don't
believe you so much as...

33:58.231 --> 33:59.664
Then what?

33:59.866 --> 34:02.911
Jerry, you told me everything was
gonna be all right.

34:02.911 --> 34:05.162
- Erica...
- You said it would be okay.

34:05.162 --> 34:06.882
What is this?
What is going on?

34:06.882 --> 34:09.126
What's going on is we may not
be able to win this.

34:09.126 --> 34:10.204
No, no.

34:10.204 --> 34:11.928
No, no, no, no!

34:13.947 --> 34:16.690
I, I'm not gonna go to jail, Jerry.

34:16.690 --> 34:17.844
I won't go to jail.

34:17.844 --> 34:19.074
- Erica...
- No!

34:19.074 --> 34:21.848
Erica, please stop screaming.

34:25.806 --> 34:28.637
You'll take care of me, Alan, right?

34:29.937 --> 34:32.705
You won't let me go to prison.

34:32.705 --> 34:34.534
You'll take care of me.

35:08.205 --> 35:10.769
You look like you're primping for a date.

35:10.769 --> 35:13.191
I certainly hope it's with me.

35:13.191 --> 35:15.050
Lincoln, what are you doing here?

35:15.050 --> 35:19.351
I feel our special relationship
has stalled, Shirley, don't you?

35:19.351 --> 35:22.105
I had a brief thought
of that Bella, I admit,

35:22.105 --> 35:24.422
but my mind always comes back to you.

35:24.422 --> 35:27.287
I don't know if anyone's ever
told you this before, Lincoln,

35:27.287 --> 35:30.268
but you're a pretty weird guy.

35:30.674 --> 35:32.311
Denny Crane was lovely,

35:32.311 --> 35:37.021
but I feel you and I could
sustain a deeper connection.

35:37.021 --> 35:39.786
See, the thing is,
you don't need a lawyer.

35:39.786 --> 35:42.129
The police don't consider
you a suspect.

35:42.129 --> 35:44.008
That's little comfort.

35:44.008 --> 35:47.395
What if someone else
were to turn up dead?

35:48.124 --> 35:51.647
Could I persuade you
to get a bite with me, Shirley?

35:51.647 --> 35:53.185
You could not.

35:53.185 --> 35:55.815
Would it help if I had a pistol?

35:56.076 --> 35:57.266
Oh, dear.

35:57.266 --> 35:58.648
I bet if this were a movie,

35:58.648 --> 36:02.849
we'd have one of those ominous
chords play right about now.

36:03.284 --> 36:05.059
What are you doing, Lincoln?

36:05.059 --> 36:08.544
What you're going to do
is walk out of here with me,

36:08.544 --> 36:11.196
calmly and without incident.

36:11.196 --> 36:15.904
You and I need to get on with our
special friendship, Shirley Schmidt.

36:15.904 --> 36:17.768
Lincoln, you're nuts, but

36:17.768 --> 36:19.570
you're not this nuts.

36:19.570 --> 36:24.213
Tonight's date is with me
after all, Shirley Schmidt.

36:31.998 --> 36:34.578
Thank you for seeing us, Ms. Morris.
I'm Alan Shore.

36:34.578 --> 36:36.113
This is Jerry Espenson,

36:36.113 --> 36:39.522
who you spoke to on the phone
about Paula Wilkes' will.

36:39.522 --> 36:41.019
Yes.

36:41.019 --> 36:44.446
I believe you both know Ms. Winger.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.049
Hi.

36:46.049 --> 36:49.576
Ms. Winger arrived here unannounced
ten minutes ago

36:49.576 --> 36:52.009
with a stunning new development.

36:52.009 --> 36:52.993
Which is?

36:52.993 --> 36:56.106
Basically, the will of Paula Wilkes
has been superseded.

36:56.106 --> 36:58.525
Do you know what a holographic
will is, Mr. Shore?

36:58.525 --> 37:00.560
- I'm sure I must.
- It's a handwritten will.

37:00.560 --> 37:02.093
It need not be notarized or witnessed

37:02.093 --> 37:04.001
so long as it's
in the testator's handwriting.

37:04.001 --> 37:05.052
Yes.

37:05.052 --> 37:06.998
It seems Paula Wilkes wrote out

37:06.998 --> 37:11.388
such a will in Las Vegas last weekend
on the Botticelli hotel's stationary.

37:11.388 --> 37:14.994
Ms. Winger was kind enough
to bring it to me.

37:14.994 --> 37:17.069
How does this will change the old one?

37:17.069 --> 37:18.192
Completely.

37:18.192 --> 37:22.363
It leaves all of Ms. Wilkes'
estate to Ms. Winger.

37:22.789 --> 37:23.880
She loved me.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.453
Well, you made her laugh.

37:25.453 --> 37:26.914
I'm funny.

37:26.914 --> 37:30.626
Are you telling me
this handwritten will is valid?

37:30.626 --> 37:31.803
Completely.

37:31.803 --> 37:35.573
It turns out, Ms. Winger
is also a lawyer.

37:36.404 --> 37:38.902
The plot thickens.

37:45.638 --> 37:48.744
Denny, you seen Shirley?

37:48.744 --> 37:49.656
Why?

37:49.656 --> 37:51.442
- She was gonna meet me.
- Why?

37:51.442 --> 37:53.203
We had some business to discuss.

37:53.203 --> 37:54.538
What sort of business?

37:54.538 --> 37:56.992
The kind that wasn't yours, actually.

37:56.992 --> 37:58.538
I told Alan. I'm telling you.

37:58.538 --> 38:00.122
Stay away from Shirley.

38:02.608 --> 38:04.053
I'm okay.

38:09.237 --> 38:12.402
Denny, she can't keep tackling you.
You'll end up in the hospital.

38:12.402 --> 38:14.424
I know.

38:17.334 --> 38:22.379
I must admit that the idea of
a mother-daughter menage a twaddle...

38:22.379 --> 38:24.667
I think you mean "trois."

38:26.373 --> 38:30.137
How could any mother hit on
her daughter's boyfriend?

38:30.137 --> 38:32.914
Loneliness is the hunter, my friend.

38:32.914 --> 38:35.541
Denny, that's almost profound, almost.

38:35.541 --> 38:37.010
Hi, guys.

38:38.722 --> 38:40.769
Just getting some fresh air.

38:40.769 --> 38:42.178
Why?

38:42.417 --> 38:46.698
No reason.
I just saw you out here and, uh...

38:47.363 --> 38:49.394
that's all.

38:51.146 --> 38:54.405
I should get back to work.

38:56.023 --> 38:57.407
See you.

39:01.372 --> 39:03.240
What was that all about?

39:05.323 --> 39:07.206
I wonder.

39:08.262 --> 39:12.117
This little murder case,
is she guilty?

39:12.117 --> 39:15.309
All women are guilty, Denny.
You shou know that.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.123
Yeah.

39:18.444 --> 39:20.331
Guilty of wanting me.

39:20.331 --> 39:24.183
Little ones, big ones,
girls that climb on rocks.

39:30.123 --> 39:31.805
I've got to remember,

39:31.805 --> 39:35.466
before I open my mouth,
always look both ways for midgets.

39:35.466 --> 39:37.097
That's a good rule to live by.

39:37.097 --> 39:38.789
You're damn right.

39:39.289 --> 39:44.801
So, this client of yours,
she did it, huh?

39:45.087 --> 39:46.821
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on!

39:46.821 --> 39:48.935
She made hot lesbian love to the victim.

39:48.935 --> 39:50.584
Got dumped, got even.

39:50.584 --> 39:52.307
- When's the trial?
- Tuesday.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.309
- This Tuesday?
- 10 o'clock.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.362
Can you win?

39:56.362 --> 39:58.458
If she'll let me.

39:58.458 --> 40:00.330
What does that mean?

40:00.330 --> 40:02.814
We need to change our plea.

40:03.721 --> 40:05.783
She's insane.
