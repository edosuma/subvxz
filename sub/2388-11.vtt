WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.378
Can I get you guys
anything to drink?

00:03.462 --> 00:04.505
- Scotch, neat.
- Scotch, neat.

00:04.505 --> 00:07.216
Jinx.

00:08.675 --> 00:11.887
Oh, my...

00:11.887 --> 00:13.680
God.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.141
<i>Kids, you may be
wondering why five adults</i>

00:16.225 --> 00:19.144
<i>in their 30s would take
a jinx so seriously.</i>

00:19.228 --> 00:21.897
<i>It all started one day
five years ago.</i>

00:21.897 --> 00:23.440
- Ooh, <i>Van Helsing.</i>
- Ooh, <i>Van Helsing.</i>

00:23.524 --> 00:25.776
Jinx. You're jinxed.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.486
That means that you
can't speak until someone

00:27.486 --> 00:29.947
who was present for the
jinx says your name, or else

00:29.947 --> 00:32.115
you will have
very bad luck.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.450
That's ridiculous.

00:34.785 --> 00:35.994
You broke the jinx.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.788
Marshall, I'm a grown-ass man.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.831
I'm on my building's
co-op board.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.584
When I say a Pinot Noir tastes
luxuriously earthy

00:42.668 --> 00:45.420
with a hint of rhubarb,
I'm not faking it.

00:45.504 --> 00:46.505
I've had several

00:46.505 --> 00:48.715
of the same sexual partners
as Henry Kissinger.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.677
I'm not about to stop talking
just because I was jinxed.

00:53.929 --> 00:55.264
<i>Barney broke three limbs</i>

00:55.264 --> 00:56.348
<i>and two vertebrae,</i>

00:56.348 --> 00:58.183
<i>but he never broke
another jinx.</i>

00:58.267 --> 01:01.270
<i>In fact, he started taking
jinxes way too seriously.</i>

01:01.270 --> 01:03.897
Barney, I'm on hold
with Sports Talk AM

01:03.981 --> 01:06.149
to talk to my childhood hero
from the Minnesota Twins.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.317
Who's your childhood hero?

01:07.401 --> 01:08.902
- Frank Viola.
- Frank Viola... Jinx!

01:08.986 --> 01:11.154
FRANK
<i>Hello, this is Frank.</i>

01:11.238 --> 01:12.281
<i>Anyone there?</i>

01:12.281 --> 01:14.032
<i>Hello?</i>

01:14.116 --> 01:16.034
<i>I can hear you breathing,
you coward.</i>

01:17.369 --> 01:19.454
<i>So, when someone
finally jinxed Barney</i>

01:19.538 --> 01:20.539
<i>for the first time in years,</i>

01:20.539 --> 01:21.623
<i>we were pretty psyched.</i>

01:21.707 --> 01:24.877
The reign of terror is over!

01:24.877 --> 01:26.503
I've had this cigar
in my pocket for two years,

01:26.587 --> 01:28.130
waiting for this moment.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.634
Aw, that would've been good
about two years ago.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.512
Cheers.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.598
- Huzzah!
- Huzzah.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.434
Oh, oh, oh, you want us
to say your name

01:40.434 --> 01:42.019
and un-jinx you?

01:42.019 --> 01:43.478
I don't think so, pal.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.689
This is gonna
be a long jinx.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.733
Like Yom Kippur
services long.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.152
The only difference is,
Yom Kippur's a fast

01:50.152 --> 01:52.779
and this one's
gonna be a slow.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.448
Oh!
Now, Ted,

01:54.448 --> 01:57.367
I was wondering if you could
expand upon what you were saying

01:57.451 --> 01:59.912
earlier about
antiquated currency.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.205
Ah, yes, yes.

02:01.205 --> 02:03.040
Contrary to popular belief,

02:03.040 --> 02:06.460
the buffalo nickel was modeled
on the Black Diamond bison

02:06.460 --> 02:10.130
rather than the more iconic
Western Plains bison.

02:10.214 --> 02:11.381
To wit,

02:11.465 --> 02:13.050
if President Taft
had had his way,

02:13.050 --> 02:15.385
we'd all be talking
about the egret nickel.

02:30.943 --> 02:33.487
<i>In the winter of 2012 the skyscraper</i>

02:33.487 --> 02:35.447
<i>that I designed was
about to open,</i>

02:35.531 --> 02:37.824
<i>which got me thinking
about the most influential</i>

02:37.908 --> 02:39.952
<i>architecture professor
I ever had.</i>

02:39.952 --> 02:43.080
So when the children
of our grandchildren's children

02:43.080 --> 02:47.334
ask us "Who were we,"
they'll find the answer carved

02:47.334 --> 02:52.214
into the granite poetry
of our architecture.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.007
Okay.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.468
It doesn't get any
better than that.

02:56.552 --> 02:57.803
Class dismissed.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.393
Wow, just wow.

03:04.393 --> 03:05.477
Do you need something?

03:05.561 --> 03:07.855
I have an apple I was hoping
to eat in silence.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.566
Of course,
Professor Vinick, I, um,

03:10.566 --> 03:12.150
I-I sketched out a design,

03:12.234 --> 03:15.362
and it'd be such an honor
if you took a look at it.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.781
Oh, well.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.449
It is believed

03:19.533 --> 03:23.078
that it took the pharaohs
over 100 years

03:23.078 --> 03:24.788
to build the Sphinx.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.958
So...

03:27.958 --> 03:29.418
you think

03:29.418 --> 03:31.378
I should spend more time on it?

03:31.378 --> 03:32.671
Oh, dear God, no.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.006
This is terrible.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.258
Then, why'd you mention
the Sphinx?

03:38.594 --> 03:41.430
I find my mind is
often with the Sphinx.

03:42.514 --> 03:45.142
Anyway, you'll never
be an architect.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.268
<i>You'll never be an architect.</i>

03:46.268 --> 03:47.352
<i>You'll never
be an architect.</i>

03:47.436 --> 03:49.938
<i>You'll never be an architect!</i>

03:50.022 --> 03:52.441
Well, guess what.
I sent Professor Vinick

03:52.441 --> 03:54.109
the invitation
to the opening of my building,

03:54.193 --> 03:56.195
so he'll see that
I did become an architect,

03:56.195 --> 03:59.072
and that I've moved past
his petty, hurtful words.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.533
Wow. 15 years later
and you're still this obsessed.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.076
Yeah, if Vinick ever
goes missing,

04:03.160 --> 04:05.579
the cops are gonna come looking
for him in your basement.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.040
Totally, he's Ted's pit guy.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.042
How dare you?

04:10.042 --> 04:11.251
And what is that?

04:11.335 --> 04:12.669
A pit guy is someone

04:12.753 --> 04:15.005
you've been obsessed with
for so long...

04:15.005 --> 04:16.798
<i>that it's driven you
crazy enough</i>

04:16.882 --> 04:18.884
<i>to throw them
in a pit in your basement</i>

04:18.884 --> 04:22.262
<i>like in The Silence
of the Lambs.</i>

04:26.183 --> 04:28.977
I'm not gonna
<i>Silence of the Lambs</i> him.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.688
At most,
I'd <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i> him.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.273
Though I don't see
a scenario where he agrees

04:33.357 --> 04:34.608
to play me in a pentathlon.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.778
Yeah, I'm with Ted, there
is no one I hate enough

04:37.778 --> 04:40.572
to throw into a pit.

04:40.656 --> 04:41.949
What?

04:41.949 --> 04:44.409
<i>When Robin's
most hated coworker Patrice</i>

04:44.493 --> 04:45.661
<i>started dating Barney,</i>

04:45.661 --> 04:47.412
<i>she became obsessed.</i>

04:47.496 --> 04:49.998
Patrice, Patrice goes
in your pit.

04:50.082 --> 04:53.544
Guys, I told you, I am done
obsessing about Patrice.

04:53.544 --> 04:54.878
Just drop her.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.797
- Drop her in a pit.
- Enough.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.508
We all have people that
we would throw in our pits,

04:59.508 --> 05:01.593
and I'm sure we all have people

05:01.677 --> 05:04.179
who would like to throw us
in their pits.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.181
Yeah, if Marshall
or I ever go missing,

05:06.265 --> 05:08.517
I'll tell you whose
basement to look in.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.060
Daryl LaCourte.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.144
Oh, no.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.354
It's creepy Daryl.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.647
Let's get out of here
before he sees us.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.608
Hey, hot sack
coming through.

05:16.692 --> 05:17.693
Ha... ha...

05:17.693 --> 05:18.777
- Hi, Daryl.
- Hey, Daryl.

05:18.861 --> 05:21.655
Hey! I feel like I never see
you guys anymore.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.157
Like whenever I'm getting
to a party, you're just leaving.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.785
Even that party at your place,
you guys just raced off

05:26.869 --> 05:28.453
into the night at 7:30.

05:28.537 --> 05:29.746
That's weird.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.082
But this is great,
the three hackmigos

05:32.082 --> 05:35.335
back together again.

05:35.419 --> 05:38.797
We played Hacky Sack together
once freshman year, Daryl.

05:38.881 --> 05:39.882
Once.

05:39.882 --> 05:41.466
November 14, 1996.

05:41.550 --> 05:42.718
That is the best memory ever.

05:42.718 --> 05:44.052
Sure.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.055
The three hackmigos
for life.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.142
To this day, we are
still getting e-mails

05:50.142 --> 05:51.894
and posts from Daryl.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.271
He has commented
on every photo

05:54.271 --> 05:56.648
of Baby Marvin
we have ever posted,

05:56.732 --> 05:57.733
and then

05:57.733 --> 06:01.195
he comments on his own comments.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.075
Hey, guys, look,
it's Bar...

06:07.159 --> 06:09.411
none, my favorite
non-speaking

06:09.411 --> 06:11.205
jinxed person
in the world.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.373
How was your day?

06:35.479 --> 06:37.064
Yeah, I didn't get
a word of that.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.524
Sorry, buddy.

06:38.524 --> 06:41.735
Ah, Scherbatsky, it's
my favorite time of year.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.237
Didn't know
you liked Christmas so much.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.197
No, year-end reviews.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.241
We get to fire some people.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.825
Get into the spirit.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.953
Look, Sandy, you might
enjoy firing people

06:50.953 --> 06:52.329
for petty personal differences.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.331
I'd hardly call giving
me gonorrhea

06:54.331 --> 06:55.457
a petty personal difference.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.459
But I am a professional,

06:57.543 --> 07:00.003
and I would never fire someone
for unprofessional reasons.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.880
Well, somebody's got to go.

07:01.964 --> 07:04.174
<i>Kids, the thing
about pit people,</i>

07:04.258 --> 07:05.968
<i>sometimes you don't
even know you have one</i>

07:05.968 --> 07:08.470
<i>until you have
a chance to push 'em in.</i>

07:08.554 --> 07:09.888
Hi, Robin.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.810
Not happening, bro.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.897
Not happening, bro.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.944
Hand get tired?

07:23.944 --> 07:26.446
Not happening, bro.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.240
I hold in my hand

07:28.240 --> 07:30.409
the RSVP from Professor Vinick.

07:30.409 --> 07:31.493
Uh-huh.

07:31.577 --> 07:33.453
Ah, he's checked

07:33.537 --> 07:34.913
"Will not attend,"
which is fine,

07:34.997 --> 07:37.749
because all I needed
to know was that he knows.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.419
So now I will throw this in
the trash and never look at it.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.547
What's this?

07:43.547 --> 07:45.132
"I believe you've sent this
to the wrong person.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.260
I have no idea
who Ted Mosby is."

07:48.260 --> 07:49.970
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.976
Oh, you'll remember who I am,
Professor Vinick.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.770
You'll never forget it.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.314
Not happening, bro.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.153
Ted, just because we're coming
with you to Wesleyan

08:06.153 --> 08:08.447
does not mean that we condone
your behavior.

08:08.447 --> 08:09.865
Just using it as an excuse

08:09.865 --> 08:12.576
to see the old campus...

08:12.576 --> 08:15.078
and maybe watch you have
a complete mental breakdown.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.956
What are you even gonna do
when you see Professor Vinick?

08:18.040 --> 08:20.459
Oh, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.548
Sweet merciful Franks Gehry
and Lloyd Wright,

08:26.632 --> 08:29.718
from what brilliant mind was
this work of art sired?

08:29.718 --> 08:31.678
Mosby.

08:31.762 --> 08:34.348
Ted Mosby.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.850
Architect.

08:36.934 --> 08:37.935
But that's-that's...

08:37.935 --> 08:39.978
Impossible?

08:40.062 --> 08:43.023
Looks like
you were wrong, Vinick.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.316
Dead wrong.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.866
No!

08:57.079 --> 08:58.830
Be careful, Ted.

08:58.914 --> 09:02.835
Revenge fantasies never
work out the way you want.

09:02.835 --> 09:05.045
Especially dance-
based revenge.

09:06.255 --> 09:07.631
My prom was rough, guys.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.508
Ooh! We're almost there.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.927
Oh, I can't wait
to see the old campus.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.680
I'm gonna grab one of those
giant dining hall hot dogs.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.640
Oh, I love those huge wieners.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.144
I'm not so sure you heard me.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.857
I said, "I love
those huge wieners."

09:24.857 --> 09:26.024
I love them.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.317
In my mouth.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.865
So, let me ask you a few
questions, Clarice... Patrice.

09:32.865 --> 09:35.117
How would you rate
your performance

09:35.117 --> 09:37.035
in the last six months?

09:37.119 --> 09:39.037
Well, I don't like
to talk about myself,

09:39.121 --> 09:41.540
but all my coworkers deserve
an A-double-plus,

09:41.540 --> 09:43.625
that's for suresies.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.919
Ooh, fancy lotion.

09:46.003 --> 09:49.256
It puts the lotion
in the basket.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.009
It's just, this is
really nice lotion.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.969
And what a pretty basket, Robin.

09:53.969 --> 09:56.388
I know, that's why
I bought it, Patrice!

09:58.223 --> 09:59.308
Man, it's like

09:59.308 --> 10:01.518
- nothing has changed.
- Mmm, I know.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.562
The bun, the relish.

10:09.568 --> 10:10.569
That's a knee.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.154
It's a beautifully
drawn knee, so?

10:18.535 --> 10:22.122
That's a barn.

10:22.206 --> 10:24.041
Oh, knee barn, right.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.125
That's a great idea, Lily.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.293
On the way home,
we should stop

10:26.293 --> 10:27.669
at the knee barn,

10:27.753 --> 10:30.839
pick us up some wholesale knees. Yeah.

10:30.923 --> 10:33.175
Marshall? Lily!

10:33.175 --> 10:36.720
You... you're here.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.722
- Hi, Daryl.
- Hi, Daryl.

10:38.722 --> 10:39.806
Hi.

10:39.890 --> 10:40.891
Wow,

10:40.891 --> 10:42.976
after all these years.

10:43.060 --> 10:46.355
You look just like you do
in my paintings.

10:46.355 --> 10:48.357
Come here, guys.

10:50.025 --> 10:52.569
There are men
and there are gods.

10:52.653 --> 10:55.864
Antoni Gaudí was both.

10:55.948 --> 10:58.617
<i>There are jerk faces
and there are buttholes.</i>

10:58.617 --> 11:00.953
<i>Professor Vinick was both.</i>

11:00.953 --> 11:02.871
<i>Good one, Ted.</i>

11:02.955 --> 11:05.541
<i>Come on, Vinick,
give me an opening.</i>

11:05.541 --> 11:07.918
Gaudí's architecture
gave expression

11:07.918 --> 11:12.506
to the anarchic geometric form
of nature.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.716
<i>"Gaudí's architecture..."</i>

11:14.800 --> 11:17.261
<i>Actually, that's
a really good point.</i>

11:17.261 --> 11:20.556
<i>Wow, Professor Vinick</i>

11:20.556 --> 11:23.475
<i>Man, you taught me so much</i>

11:23.559 --> 11:26.478
<i>About architecture and life</i>

11:26.562 --> 11:29.606
<i>God, your lectures
are so cool</i>

11:29.690 --> 11:33.694
<i>I'll earn your respect
and we'll be best friends</i>

11:33.694 --> 11:38.115
Okay, it doesn't get
any better than that.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.284
No, it doesn't.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.454
What are you
doing here, Daryl?

11:44.538 --> 11:46.456
Well, I live
right down the street.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.084
But I work
right here.

11:49.168 --> 11:51.211
- Whoa.
- Oh, boy.

11:53.881 --> 11:54.882
Are those...

11:54.882 --> 11:57.676
...our,
our faces up there, buddy?

11:57.676 --> 11:59.136
Hack, yeah!

11:59.136 --> 12:00.637
It was just as much
your idea as mine

12:00.721 --> 12:03.682
to open up a Hacky Sack store
here at Wesleyan.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.350
So you never left?

12:05.434 --> 12:07.686
Once. I met a girl
on Craigslist,

12:07.686 --> 12:09.688
and I flew to Boston
to meet her.

12:09.688 --> 12:12.566
She was a man, 300 pounds,
and robbed me.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.692
Still, the best
night of my life.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.360
Until now!

12:15.444 --> 12:18.697
The three hackmigos
back together again!

12:18.697 --> 12:21.325
You know, I've been waiting
forever to give you something.

12:21.325 --> 12:22.993
You're coming with me
to my house,

12:22.993 --> 12:26.538
and I'm not taking no
for an answer.

12:26.622 --> 12:28.498
<i>Dude, this is your chance.</i>

12:28.582 --> 12:30.334
<i>Set me free,
and I will lie you out</i>

12:30.334 --> 12:31.793
<i>of this creepy nightmare.</i>

12:31.877 --> 12:33.170
<i>This is a tough one.</i>

12:33.170 --> 12:35.214
<i>On the one hand, we might die.</i>

12:35.214 --> 12:37.841
<i>On the other, you're jinxed.</i>

12:37.925 --> 12:39.843
<i>Let me free, Marshall.</i>

12:39.927 --> 12:42.137
<i>This guy could be violent.</i>

12:42.221 --> 12:45.349
<i>Violent... Viola...</i>

12:45.349 --> 12:47.184
<i>Frank Viola.</i>

12:47.184 --> 12:50.229
We would love to come
to your house, Daryl!

12:51.813 --> 12:52.940
Yeah!

12:53.982 --> 12:55.275
Okay, um...

12:56.318 --> 12:58.529
how often are you
and Barney doing it?

12:58.529 --> 13:01.365
That's a strange question, Robin.

13:01.365 --> 13:02.699
You're right.

13:02.783 --> 13:04.535
Maybe I should leave.

13:04.535 --> 13:05.911
Yeah, maybe
you should.

13:05.911 --> 13:06.995
You're fired.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.707
Wow. Just wow.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.711
Uh, Ted Mosby.
I'm a former student of yours.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.965
You know, I actually became
an architect.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.341
Any chance you remember me?

13:19.341 --> 13:22.135
Oh, please excuse me, I've been
teaching for over 20 years.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.638
All the faces start
to blend together

13:24.638 --> 13:28.058
unless you have a, a weird
mustache or, or something.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.435
Junior year I tried
to grow muttonchops,

13:30.519 --> 13:34.064
but people kept saying
my face made them nauseous.

13:34.064 --> 13:36.108
Well, not people. You.

13:37.401 --> 13:39.736
Anyway, I would be honored
if you,

13:39.820 --> 13:41.572
if you took a look
at my building.

13:44.950 --> 13:45.951
This...

13:47.077 --> 13:48.662
is hideous.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.332
You'll never be an architect.

13:53.417 --> 13:54.501
<i>You'll never be an architect.</i>

13:54.585 --> 13:55.627
<i>You'll never be an architect!</i>

13:55.711 --> 13:56.962
<i>You'll never be an architect.</i>

13:56.962 --> 13:58.881
Wait. I was mistaken.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.717
You most definitely
will be an architect.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.302
Really?

14:03.302 --> 14:04.720
These are astonishing,

14:04.720 --> 14:06.805
Handlebar Pete.

14:10.058 --> 14:12.394
So, when you said
"surprise in your house,"

14:12.394 --> 14:15.731
what you really meant was
"surprise in the poorly lit

14:15.731 --> 14:18.066
windowless basement
of your house."

14:18.150 --> 14:20.360
Oh, you guys are gonna love
what I have to show you.

14:20.444 --> 14:25.115
I am so excited, I could just
cry and laugh and scream

14:25.199 --> 14:28.410
and just punch the wall over and over
and over and over and over!

14:28.410 --> 14:29.912
Could we just see it,

14:29.912 --> 14:31.079
like, up in the
living room

14:31.163 --> 14:35.334
or anywhere less...
gimp-storagey?

14:35.334 --> 14:37.544
I just realized

14:37.628 --> 14:38.921
I want to take
a picture of this.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.465
I want to put your faces
on my mantel like a trophy.

14:41.465 --> 14:42.966
Like a trophy!

14:45.052 --> 14:48.263
- Aah!
- Aah!

14:51.892 --> 14:55.646
Here I come

14:55.646 --> 15:00.567
And I've got
your surprise right here!

15:00.651 --> 15:02.986
No! We don't want
your surprise, Daryl!

15:03.070 --> 15:04.196
We're not your amigos,

15:04.196 --> 15:06.198
we're definitely
not your hackmigos.

15:06.198 --> 15:07.366
And before you murder us,

15:07.366 --> 15:09.243
you should know
that we have a child!

15:10.744 --> 15:13.163
He probably has
eight or nine!

15:13.247 --> 15:15.958
What? Murder?

15:15.958 --> 15:17.709
I wanted to give you a check.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.337
For $100,000...

15:20.337 --> 15:24.716
for coming up with the idea
of the Three Hackmigos with me.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.553
I brought you down here
to show you all my inventory.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.723
Business has really exploded.

15:33.809 --> 15:35.435
I mean, I'm sort
of the Mark Zuckerberg

15:35.519 --> 15:38.230
of jam-band concert
parking lot athletics.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.107
Well, second.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.109
But I'm coming for you,
Devil Stick Ron.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.531
Why would you fire me?

15:47.531 --> 15:50.701
Because nobody should be
as happy as you are.

15:50.701 --> 15:54.496
And also your cookies...

15:54.580 --> 15:56.456
they're only pretty good.

16:00.836 --> 16:02.671
Robin, is this really about me?

16:05.674 --> 16:06.842
No, it's not.

16:13.223 --> 16:17.019
The old "fire and bang."
Respect, Scherbatsky.

16:20.397 --> 16:24.193
Hey, Ted, I see you're holding
a little version of your building.

16:24.193 --> 16:25.736
So I assume it all worked out?

16:25.736 --> 16:28.530
I realized, since I work
in a three-dimensional medium,

16:28.614 --> 16:30.741
the only way to really stick it
to Vinick would be

16:30.741 --> 16:32.618
with a three-dimensional model.

16:32.618 --> 16:34.620
Whatever you do, um,
don't march in there

16:34.620 --> 16:36.330
thinking, "I'm
gonna do the worm.

16:36.330 --> 16:38.457
That'll show 'em!"

16:38.457 --> 16:42.127
Seriously, guys, I-I can't stress enough
how bad my prom was.

16:42.211 --> 16:44.463
Speaking of the past...

16:44.463 --> 16:48.091
Wow, we feel like idiots.
We're sorry.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.093
You know, honestly,
it's fine.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.720
Look how great I'm doing.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.430
Look at what I've built.
I don't need

16:53.514 --> 16:55.224
the validation
of some people from college

16:55.224 --> 16:56.808
to feel good about myself.

16:56.892 --> 16:58.602
My life is amazing!

16:58.602 --> 17:01.522
I own a timeshare in
St. Barts with P-Funk!

17:01.522 --> 17:03.565
The-the whole band?

17:03.649 --> 17:04.691
Yeah.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.319
Do you guys jam?

17:07.319 --> 17:09.321
That's all we do.

17:11.657 --> 17:14.201
So, you completely rejected
the guy who's been obsessing

17:14.201 --> 17:17.996
about you for 16 years,
and he was okay with it?

17:19.039 --> 17:20.165
Whoa.

17:20.249 --> 17:23.460
Is creepy Daryl more emotionally
adjusted than I am?

17:23.544 --> 17:25.170
<i>Kids, sometimes in life</i>

17:25.254 --> 17:27.714
<i>you'll make a pit
for someone in your mind.</i>

17:27.798 --> 17:31.969
<i>But ultimately the only person
in that pit is yourself.</i>

17:34.012 --> 17:35.472
I'm sorry.

17:35.556 --> 17:39.393
Just seeing you with Barney
has brought up

17:39.393 --> 17:41.603
some old feelings,
and I...

17:41.687 --> 17:43.814
I really don't like feelings.

17:43.814 --> 17:47.150
But that's not your fault
or Barney's fault.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.362
It's just really hard
seeing you with him.

17:50.362 --> 17:54.992
<i>There's been a book
on the side of the bed...</i>

17:54.992 --> 17:56.368
<i>Which means
there's only one person</i>

17:56.368 --> 17:58.245
<i>who can let you out of the pit.</i>

18:03.000 --> 18:04.960
<i>Many years from now</i>

18:07.129 --> 18:09.840
<i>I know you'll hear me somehow...</i>

18:09.840 --> 18:13.051
So you fired Patrice?

18:13.135 --> 18:15.012
No, she's staying.

18:18.182 --> 18:20.684
<i>The places we will go...</i>

18:21.935 --> 18:22.978
Let's get out of here, guys.

18:24.313 --> 18:26.690
Oh, Mr. Mosby.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.276
You built a model
of your building.

18:29.276 --> 18:32.571
- No.
- Why? To prove some sort of point?

18:32.571 --> 18:33.697
This is just sad.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.407
No, no,
I-I was just throwing it out.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.410
Sure, you were.

18:38.410 --> 18:39.703
No!

18:39.703 --> 18:42.080
No, I-I-I had a
transcendent moment

18:42.164 --> 18:44.583
where I found emotional clarity!

18:44.583 --> 18:45.834
And I realize shouting that

18:45.918 --> 18:48.504
makes it seem like
it's not true, but I did!

18:50.797 --> 18:52.007
Yeah, we're gonna grab
some snacks.

18:52.007 --> 18:53.383
You guys want anything?

18:55.385 --> 18:56.386
Spicy beef jerky.

18:56.470 --> 18:59.389
Got you loud and clear.

19:04.686 --> 19:05.938
Oh, my God!
Barney!

19:05.938 --> 19:07.231
You unjinxed me!

19:07.231 --> 19:09.191
I'm free! If the bison

19:09.191 --> 19:10.484
on the nickel could hear you
talk about them,

19:10.484 --> 19:12.819
they would diminish their population
even further on purpose.

19:12.903 --> 19:15.072
If Lily wants a big wiener in
her mouth, she's got my number.

19:15.072 --> 19:16.865
And I'm sorry that you took the
rap for all the farting on

19:16.949 --> 19:19.743
the car ride up here.
That was me!

19:19.743 --> 19:21.495
The ring!
What's-what's-what's the ring?

19:21.495 --> 19:24.289
Right, the ring. I'm gonna ask
Patrice to marry me.

19:24.373 --> 19:25.374
- Are you serious?
- Are you serious?

19:25.374 --> 19:27.334
Jinx! Good!

19:27.334 --> 19:29.878
I need to say some things
without you interrupting.

19:29.962 --> 19:32.965
Yes, I am serious.
I know that if you could talk,

19:32.965 --> 19:34.216
you'd say that I'm crazy

19:34.216 --> 19:36.301
or that I'm overcorrecting
or that I'm moving too fast.

19:36.385 --> 19:37.553
But you would be wrong.

19:37.553 --> 19:39.763
Look, I have banged my way
through every bimbo

19:39.847 --> 19:42.015
in the tristate area,
and it left me

19:42.099 --> 19:44.518
feeling nothing but, but broken.

19:44.518 --> 19:46.520
But now, with Patrice,

19:46.520 --> 19:51.316
for the first time in my life,
I feel settled and happy.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.443
I want to feel this way forever.

19:53.527 --> 19:55.362
So tomorrow night on the roof

19:55.362 --> 19:57.281
of the World Wide News building,

19:57.281 --> 19:58.740
that's Patrice's favorite spot,

19:58.824 --> 20:00.242
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.536
Ah, poot-tu-tat!
You're jinxed.

20:02.536 --> 20:05.289
I'll unjinx you if you'll follow
these two rules:

20:05.289 --> 20:07.207
one: you can't try to talk me
out of it,

20:07.291 --> 20:11.628
and two: you can't tell anybody.
Agreed?

20:15.382 --> 20:17.718
It's a jinx swear,
so if you break it,

20:17.718 --> 20:19.386
I get to hit you in the nuts
three times

20:19.386 --> 20:20.762
with a Wiffle ball bat.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.559
Thank you... Ted.

20:28.979 --> 20:30.063
Hey.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.692
Hi, guys!

20:33.692 --> 20:35.277
No. But you're jinxed!

20:35.277 --> 20:37.696
I tricked Ted
into saying my name.

20:37.696 --> 20:39.406
Aw, come on, Ted!

20:39.406 --> 20:41.158
Jinx! Jinx!
Ha-ha!

20:41.158 --> 20:45.329
The reign of terror
is back!

20:45.329 --> 20:47.539
Hey, if you guys don't want me
to smoke

20:47.623 --> 20:49.583
or fart in here, just speak up.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.168

21:04.598 --> 21:06.225

Not happening, bro.
