There I am,
minding my own business,

15:18.468 --> 15:20.135
when my arm just falls off!

15:20.136 --> 15:22.671
Clearly Megatron inflicted
more damage upon me

15:22.672 --> 15:24.206
than you realize...

15:24.207 --> 15:26.108
[ Scoffs ]
...Doctor.

15:26.109 --> 15:28.677
Well, uh,
o-on the bright side,

15:28.678 --> 15:31.447
this provides an excellent
opportunity for an upgrade.

15:31.448 --> 15:32.615
Uh, let's see.

15:32.616 --> 15:34.683
You could go
with the sonic canon.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.752
It's reliable,
low-maintenance,

15:36.753 --> 15:38.954
although it lacks
a certain flair.

15:38.955 --> 15:41.156
Personally,
I prefer the null ray.

15:41.157 --> 15:44.093
It has just the right mix
of flash and firepower.

15:44.094 --> 15:46.161
<i>I don't want a new mol!</i>

15:46.162 --> 15:49.365
I just want the same arm
I had before!

15:49.366 --> 15:53.068
Starscream, your equipment
is a bit...

15:53.069 --> 15:54.503
Uh, obsolete.

15:54.504 --> 15:57.506
I'm not sure I have another one
lying around.

15:57.507 --> 16:00.309
Of course, we could try
to salvage yours.

16:00.310 --> 16:02.044
You...Kept it, didn't you?

16:02.045 --> 16:06.815
It was [Chuckles]
Beyond recovery.

16:06.816 --> 16:08.484
[ All grunting ]

16:13.623 --> 16:15.824
Anyone know how to fire
this thing?

16:15.825 --> 16:17.459
I don't see a trigger.

16:17.460 --> 16:21.030
Starscream did something
with his fingers.

16:21.031 --> 16:22.931
[ Footsteps pounding ]

16:22.932 --> 16:25.834
[ Growling ]

16:25.835 --> 16:27.169
We have one shot.

16:27.170 --> 16:28.971
We need to make it count.

16:40.984 --> 16:43.018
<i>How do you like us now?</i>

16:43.019 --> 16:46.755
[ Growls ]

[ Gasps ]

17:06.564 --> 17:08.332
Come on! Come on!

17:09.800 --> 17:11.435
How can the zombie arm

17:11.435 --> 17:13.637
move faster
than the actual zombie?

17:18.643 --> 17:19.742
Miko's phone.

17:19.743 --> 17:20.944
[ Cellphone beeping ]

17:20.944 --> 17:22.378
It wasn't blinking before.

17:22.380 --> 17:24.448
[ Cellphone beeps ]
It's a message.

17:24.449 --> 17:27.417
"In alternate dimension
with zombie.

17:27.419 --> 17:28.419
Help."

17:28.420 --> 17:30.754
That doesn't sound possible.

17:30.755 --> 17:32.589
Ratchet, can we triangulate

17:32.590 --> 17:35.559
the geographical position
of the cellphone signal?

17:35.560 --> 17:39.229
In a parallel
dimensional plane?

17:39.230 --> 17:40.998
Let's find out.

17:45.737 --> 17:49.306
[ Warbling ]

17:49.307 --> 17:52.409
My dark Energon shard --

17:52.410 --> 17:53.911
Pulsing?

17:53.912 --> 17:56.880
My warrior lives.

17:56.881 --> 17:59.616
Ah, look what I found
in storage.

17:59.617 --> 18:01.418
What are you doing?!

18:01.419 --> 18:02.986
You were right, knockout.

18:02.987 --> 18:05.889
I'm much too attached
to my original appendage.

18:05.890 --> 18:07.157
<i>I will retrieve it.</i>

18:07.158 --> 18:10.093
Ratchet: Now, calculating
for relative time delays

18:10.094 --> 18:11.762
and ionospheric distortions,

18:11.763 --> 18:14.765
the signal emanated
from the exact location

18:14.766 --> 18:17.734
as the original
ground bridge coordinates.

18:17.735 --> 18:20.637
But we already
looked for them there.

18:20.638 --> 18:24.374
Perhaps, but not in
the correct dimensional phase,

18:24.375 --> 18:26.210
as their message stated.

18:26.211 --> 18:29.246
But if I can recreate
the feedback loop

18:29.247 --> 18:30.914
which triggered the event,

18:30.915 --> 18:33.717
I might be able to generate
a rescue portal

18:33.718 --> 18:36.386
allowing passage
from their dimension...

18:36.387 --> 18:37.855
Back to base?
No!

18:37.856 --> 18:39.223
We're talking about

18:39.224 --> 18:41.925
interdimensional travel
here, Bulkhead!

18:41.926 --> 18:44.728
Attempting to redirect
the vortex trajectory

18:44.729 --> 18:46.263
would be far too risky.

18:46.264 --> 18:47.764
[ Sarcastically ]
Everyone knows that.

18:47.765 --> 18:50.968
If the coordinates
aren't precisely the same,

18:50.969 --> 18:53.904
who knows where
the humans could wind up?

18:57.742 --> 18:58.909
Oh, come on.

18:58.910 --> 19:02.045
This place is like one big
merry-go-round!

19:02.046 --> 19:06.183
Skyquake,
your master summons you!

19:06.184 --> 19:08.418
How'd that freak
get into our dimension?

19:08.419 --> 19:11.054
He didn't.
He can't see us.

19:11.055 --> 19:13.524
Forget starscream.
We got to run...

19:13.525 --> 19:14.591
Some more.

19:20.431 --> 19:21.765
[ Growls ]

19:21.766 --> 19:23.133
A ground bridge portal?

19:23.134 --> 19:25.202
That has to be our way
out of here.

19:25.203 --> 19:26.870
The autobots saw our text.

19:26.871 --> 19:28.105
What?

19:28.106 --> 19:30.807
Mine...Or theirs?

19:32.510 --> 19:35.512
If we go through,
we run smack into starscream.

19:35.513 --> 19:36.580
If we don't...

19:36.581 --> 19:38.482
We're zombie chow.

We keep running in circles.

a couple dozen times?
