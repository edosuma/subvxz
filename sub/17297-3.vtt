00:00.901 --> 00:04.169
Previously on
"Pretty Little Liars"...

00:04.171 --> 00:06.338
IT'S TOO HARD TO SIT
IN THIS ROOM EVERY DAY

00:06.340 --> 00:07.940
AND CALL YOU MR. FITZ.

00:07.942 --> 00:10.442
OKAY, I CAN'T PRETEND
LIKE I DON'T KNOW YOU.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.611
I'M REALLY SORRY, MOM.
FOR WHAT?

00:12.613 --> 00:14.113
THE COP.

00:14.115 --> 00:16.582
WE'RE MEETING
MELISSA'S FIANCE.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.418
Wren: DOES SHE HAVE
TO KNOW EVERYTHING?

00:19.420 --> 00:21.020
STOP, STOP.
WE CAN'T.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.422
THIS IS NO LONGER
A MISSING PERSONS INVESTIGATION.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.424
IT'S A MURDER.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.760
HANNA.
IS THIS WAITING THING
SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANT,

00:27.762 --> 00:29.228
OR IS IT BECAUSE
OF YOUR DAD?

00:29.230 --> 00:32.064
NO, IT'S ME. IT'S...
IT'S MY CHOICE.

00:32.066 --> 00:34.133
SO, I'M CORRUPTING YOU.

00:34.135 --> 00:37.302
WHAT ARE YOU
SO WEIRDED OUT ABOUT?

00:37.304 --> 00:39.738
Emily:<i> I THINK THERE'S</i>
<i> SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME.</i>

00:39.740 --> 00:41.306
YOU LOST A DEAR FRIEND.

00:41.308 --> 00:44.109
YOU NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.544
( plants rustling )

00:45.546 --> 00:47.146
Hanna: WHOSE IDEA
WAS THIS, AGAIN?

00:47.148 --> 00:48.414
Spencer:
EMILY'S MOM.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.349
Emily: THE SHED WAS ME.
MY MOM JUST SAID

00:50.351 --> 00:52.117
WE SHOULD DO
<i> SOMETHING</i> FOR US.

00:52.119 --> 00:54.787
Hanna: WELL, COULDN'T
WE DO SOMETHING
WITHOUT MOSQUITOES?

00:54.789 --> 00:56.655
THEY'RE NOT MOSQUITOES;
THEY'RE GNATS.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.290
WHATEVER! THEY'RE SMALL
AND ANNOYING,

00:58.292 --> 00:59.792
AND THEY'RE FLYING
UP MY NOSE.

00:59.794 --> 01:01.693
WELL, THEY'RE ATTRACTED
TO YOUR PERFUME

01:01.695 --> 01:04.496
AND YOUR HAIR PRODUCT
AND YOUR LIP GLOSS.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.398
SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
I ATTRACT FLIES?

01:06.400 --> 01:09.301
GNATS.
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
THIS IS THE WRONG WAY?

01:09.303 --> 01:11.870
NO, THIS IS IT.
I REMEMBER THAT TREE.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.439
IT'S THE HALFWAY POINT.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.607
THERE'S 136 STEPS
LEFT TO THE SHED.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.210
HAVE YOU BEEN OUT HERE
SINCE... ALISON?

01:18.212 --> 01:21.547
ME? NO. NO WAY.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.549
BUT YOU REMEMBER
THAT TREE.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.350
YOU GUYS,
IT'S NOT THAT WEIRD.

01:25.352 --> 01:27.419
I MEAN, WE CAME OUT HERE
IN EIGHTH GRADE,

01:27.421 --> 01:28.954
LIKE, EVERY DAY--
EVEN AFTER.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.156
I THINK THIS IS TOTALLY
THE WRONG PLACE TO DO THIS

01:31.158 --> 01:32.558
WHATEVER YOU CALL IT--
SHRINE.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.093
IT'S NOT A SHRINE.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.294
IT'S JUST A PLACE
TO REMEMBER ALISON.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.229
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT?

01:37.231 --> 01:39.865
DOING IT WAY OUT HERE
MAKES IT LOOK LIKE WE
HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.567
YOU'RE WORRIED
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK?

01:41.569 --> 01:43.001
WELL, AREN'T YOU?

01:43.003 --> 01:44.803
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO GIVE
THAT CREEPY DETECTIVE

01:44.805 --> 01:46.605
MORE REASONS TO QUESTION US?

01:51.178 --> 01:53.579
HANNA, WHY ARE
YOU SO QUIET?

01:53.581 --> 01:57.049
I'M TRYING TO KEEP THE BUGS
IN MY NOSE AND OUT OF MY MOUTH.

01:57.051 --> 01:59.218
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE
AN OPINION ON THIS.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.652
YOU WANT MY OPINION?

02:00.654 --> 02:03.155
I SAY WE HOLD OFF
AND NOT REMEMBER HER

02:03.157 --> 02:05.357
TILL WE KNOW FOR SURE
SHE'S NOT STILL HERE.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.825
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:06.827 --> 02:08.360
YOU THINK SHE'S
STILL ALIVE?

02:08.362 --> 02:10.395
Spencer: HANNA,
THEY FOUND HER BODY.

02:10.397 --> 02:13.866
STOP. I'M OFFICIALLY SCARED.
CAN WE JUST NOT--

02:13.868 --> 02:16.068
YOU ASKED FOR MY OPINION.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.903
I DON'T BELIEVE
SHE'S REALLY GONE.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.038
WE WENT
TO HER FUNERAL!

02:20.040 --> 02:22.875
YEAH, AND WHEN WE LEFT
WE ALL GOT A TEXT FROM HER.

02:22.877 --> 02:24.076
IT WASN'T<i> HER.</i>

02:24.078 --> 02:25.978
SOMEONE IS
MESSING WITH US.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.847
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
AND WHAT ABOUT ALL
THOSE NASTY MESSAGES?

02:28.849 --> 02:31.683
I MEAN, HOW DOES THIS "A" PERSON
KNOW STUFF ONLY ALI KNEW?

02:31.685 --> 02:34.253
OKAY, THIS CONVERSATION
IS GIVING ME A HIVE.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.821
THAT'S A BITE.
MOSQUITO.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.390
SPENCER, HAVE YOU GOTTEN
ANY MORE MESSAGES?

02:38.392 --> 02:39.725
HAVEN'T YOU?

02:39.727 --> 02:41.860
( rustling )

02:41.862 --> 02:44.296
WHAT WAS THAT?
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

02:44.298 --> 02:45.864
YES, I HEARD THAT.

02:45.866 --> 02:49.034
I'M STANDING
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.936
HELLO?

02:50.938 --> 02:52.604
IS ANYBODY OUT THERE?

02:52.606 --> 02:55.274
IT'S PROBABLY A RABBIT.
HELLO?

02:55.276 --> 02:58.076
IT'S A RABBIT, HANNA.
IT'S NOT GONNA ANSWER YOU.

02:58.078 --> 03:00.212
CAN WE JUST
GET TO THE SHED?

03:00.214 --> 03:01.446
( rustling )

03:01.448 --> 03:04.283
OKAY, THAT IS
DEFINITELY NOT A RABBIT.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.784
SOMEONE'S OUT THERE.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.419
LET'S TURN AROUND.

03:07.421 --> 03:10.222
( message alerts ring )

03:29.743 --> 03:31.009
The Pierces:
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET ¶</i>

03:31.011 --> 03:32.511
<i> ¶ CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

03:32.513 --> 03:35.013
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

03:35.015 --> 03:37.516
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

03:37.518 --> 03:40.152
<i> ¶ TAKING THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

03:40.154 --> 03:42.821
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THEN I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

03:42.823 --> 03:45.090
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

03:45.092 --> 03:48.227
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO</i>
<i> CAN KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

03:48.229 --> 03:49.728
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD ¶</i>

03:51.865 --> 03:53.865
MORNING.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.367
WHERE'S MY MOTHER?

03:55.369 --> 03:57.202
SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
FOR SOMETHIN'.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.371
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT MAKES
THIS STUFF SPREADABLE.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.872
YOU WANT A WAFFLE
OR SOMETHIN'?

04:00.874 --> 04:02.374
NO. THANKS.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.542
THERE SHE IS.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.377
IT'S CANOLA OIL!

04:05.379 --> 04:07.512
DARREN, WHY DON'T
YOU GET DRESSED?

04:07.514 --> 04:08.880
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF BREAKFAST.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.749
YEAH.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.556
SO, WHAT,
HE LIVES HERE NOW?

04:17.558 --> 04:19.057
TAKE OUT THE MILK.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.059
IS THIS A PERMANENT THING?

04:21.061 --> 04:22.828
WOULD YOU KEEP
YOUR VOICE DOWN, PLEASE?

04:22.830 --> 04:24.496
GOD, IT WAS ONE PAIR
OF SUNGLASSES,

04:24.498 --> 04:25.731
AND THEY WERE LAST SEASON'S.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.232
HAND ME THE BOTTLES.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.034
MOM, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.969
DO WHAT?
SQUEEZE HIS GRAPEFRUIT.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.340
WE WILL TALK
AFTER BREAKFAST.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.943
I DON'T EAT BREAKFAST,
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.911
LOOK.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.781
UNTIL HE GETS THE STORE
TO DROP THE CHARGES

04:42.783 --> 04:44.416
FOR YOUR SHOPPING SPREE,

04:44.418 --> 04:46.251
WE'RE NOT KICKING
ANYONE TO THE CURB.

04:46.253 --> 04:47.519
THE LAST THING WE WANT

04:47.521 --> 04:49.021
IS AN ENEMY
ON THE POLICE FORCE.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.722
I GET IT, OKAY?

04:50.724 --> 04:52.858
BUT I DIDN'T COUNT ON
HAVING TO BUY HIM

04:52.860 --> 04:55.027
A FATHER'S DAY CARD, EITHER.
HANNA!

04:55.029 --> 04:58.130
THE SITUATION
IS DELICATE.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.132
BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE
BUYING ANYONE A CARD,

05:00.134 --> 05:01.099
IT SHOULD BE ME.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.438
Byron:<i> WELL, YOU'RE</i>
<i> PRETTY FAR INTO IT.</i>

05:06.440 --> 05:09.975
YEAH, I'VE GOT, LIKE,
60-SOME PAGES LEFT,

05:09.977 --> 05:11.677
AND I DON'T
WANT IT TO END.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.278
YOU SHOULD READ
HER BIOGRAPHY NEXT.

05:13.280 --> 05:16.214
THE FATHER-WORSHIP THING
BECOMES A LOT CLEARER.

05:16.216 --> 05:19.351
WELL, I WOULD WORSHIP
BOTH OF YOU A LOT MORE...

05:19.353 --> 05:21.320
IF YOU GOT ME
ANOTHER ONE OF THESE.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.155
THE POPPY SEED?
WE'LL SPLIT IT.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.589
MAKE SURE
YOUR FATHER DOESN'T

05:24.591 --> 05:25.824
DRINK ALL
MY COFFEE, PLEASE.

05:28.062 --> 05:29.561
( sighs ) DO YOU
LIKE YOUR TEACHER?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.697
WHAT?

05:31.699 --> 05:33.832
YOUR ENGLISH TEACHER.
DO YOU LIKE HIM?

05:33.834 --> 05:38.103
OH! YEAH. UH, HE'S OKAY.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.471
WHAT'S HIS NAME AGAIN?

05:39.473 --> 05:42.307
MR. FITZ. HEY,
MAYBE I'LL CHECK OUT

05:42.309 --> 05:43.909
THAT BIOGRAPHY AT SCHOOL.
WHAT'S IT CALLED?

05:43.911 --> 05:45.811
I'VE GOT A COPY OF IT
IN MY OFFICE.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.479
I'LL BRING IT HOME.
IT MIGHT INSPIRE YOU.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.147
TO WHAT, WRITE A NOVEL?

05:49.149 --> 05:50.582
YOU'VE GOT IT IN YOU.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.750
Woman: BYRON?

05:53.454 --> 05:57.489
HEY! HI. HOW YOU DOING?

05:57.491 --> 05:59.791
SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO INTERRUPT.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.527
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

06:10.304 --> 06:13.305
UM, ARIA, THIS IS,
UH, MEREDITH SORENSON.

06:13.307 --> 06:15.474
SHE ALSO TEACHES
IN THE DEPARTMENT,

06:15.476 --> 06:18.377
UH, MY DEPARTMENT,
AND THIS IS ARIA,

06:18.379 --> 06:19.444
MY DAUGHTER.

06:19.446 --> 06:22.714
OH, ARIA! HI.
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.883
DID YOU GET
MY MESSAGE?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.818
YES, I DID, AND I'M SORRY

06:26.820 --> 06:28.820
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO CALL YOU BACK.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.722
IT'S OKAY, THEY JUST NEED
THE REFERRAL BY MONDAY.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.091
I'LL GET TO IT AS SOON
AS I GET BACK TO CAMPUS.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.292
IS THERE AN E-MAIL, OR...

06:34.294 --> 06:35.260
HERE.

06:38.098 --> 06:41.199
SO, HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE HOME?

06:41.201 --> 06:42.868
THIS TOWN MUST SEEM
A LITTLE DULL

06:42.870 --> 06:44.536
AFTER SPENDING
A WHOLE YEAR OVERSEAS.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.471
NOT REALLY.

06:46.473 --> 06:49.841
OKAY, WELL, I'LL, UH...

06:49.843 --> 06:51.443
I'LL SEND THAT
BEFORE LUNCH.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.111
THANKS.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.613
I'M SO GLAD I RAN INTO YOU.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.784
NICE TO MEET YOU.
WELCOME HOME.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.425
WHY CAN'T SHE GRADUATE?

07:06.427 --> 07:08.360
SHE HAS. I TOLD YOU.

07:08.362 --> 07:10.495
SHE'S NOW
A TEACHING ASSISTANT.

07:10.497 --> 07:14.166
NOT MINE, BUT HER OFFICE
IS ACROSS THE HALL.

07:14.168 --> 07:17.002
I CAN'T PRETEND LIKE
SHE DOESN'T EXIST, ARIA.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.970
IT'S A SMALL COLLEGE.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.772
MM. NOT SMALL ENOUGH.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.607
( clunks coffee cup down )

07:22.609 --> 07:24.943
<i> YOU CAN'T AVOID</i>
<i> SEEING PEOPLE, SWEETIE.</i>

07:24.945 --> 07:27.145
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

07:27.147 --> 07:30.482
AND WHAT'S THAT--
SAD, HUMILIATING, PATHETIC?

07:30.484 --> 07:32.350
ALL OF THE ABOVE?

07:32.352 --> 07:35.454
JUST... TAKE SOMEONE ELSE.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.556
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO EXPLAIN A WEDDING

07:37.558 --> 07:39.257
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN
TO EVERY LAST CLUB MEMBER.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.327
MORNING.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.295
HEY.

07:48.969 --> 07:49.968
( snits ) EXCUSE ME.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.676
WHERE'S DAD?

07:57.678 --> 07:59.377
HE LEFT
FOR THE OFFICE.

07:59.379 --> 08:00.879
ALREADY?

08:00.881 --> 08:02.380
SO HE RAN
WITHOUT ME?

08:02.382 --> 08:04.216
WHY DIDN'T HE
JUST KNOCK ON MY DOOR?

08:04.218 --> 08:05.517
HE WAS BUSY.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.352
HE WAS HELPING MELISSA
DISPOSE OF SOME THINGS

08:07.354 --> 08:09.488
THAT... WREN LEFT BEHIND.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.590
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU
WEREN'T ONE OF THEM.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.192
HOW MANY TIMES AM I GOING
TO HAVE TO SAY IT?

08:14.194 --> 08:17.496
OH, GIRLS, PLEASE!
I CAN'T ARBITRATE
ON ONE CUP OF COFFEE.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.698
WHO'S CALLING THE PAPER
TO PULL THE ANNOUNCEMENT?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.733
IT WAS HARD ENOUGH CHANGING
MY STATUS ON FACEBOOK!

08:21.735 --> 08:23.235
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE NEWSPAPER.

08:23.237 --> 08:24.669
WHAT ABOUT
THE ENGAGEMENT DINNER?

08:24.671 --> 08:26.238
DO I HAVE
TO MAKE THAT CALL?

08:26.240 --> 08:27.706
NO, HONEY, OF COURSE NOT.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.274
JUST LOOK UP THE NUMBER
AND I'LL LEAVE A MESSAGE.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.911
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

08:32.913 --> 08:34.579
I'LL EAT
IN MY BEDROOM.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.748
OH, NO, YOU WON'T.
I JUST DRY-CLEANED
YOUR BEDSPREAD.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.916
SIT AT THE TABLE.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.818
I DON'T THINK
I'M WELCOME.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.219
THAT'S NEVER
STOPPED YOU BEFORE.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.222
I DID NOT INVITE
YOUR FIANCE TO KISS ME,

08:44.224 --> 08:45.891
MELISSA,
FOR THE LAST TIME!

08:45.893 --> 08:48.059
HE MADE THE MOVE ON ME!

08:48.061 --> 08:50.529
SPENCER, PLEASE.
AND YOU JUST SAT THERE
LIKE A THROW PILLOW

08:50.531 --> 08:52.097
WITH YOUR TONGUE
DOWN HIS THROAT!

08:52.099 --> 08:53.465
LOOK, I GET IT!

08:53.467 --> 08:55.534
YOU'RE UPSET
AND I FEEL FOR YOU,

08:55.536 --> 08:57.335
BUT DON'T DUMP IT
ALL ON ME.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.070
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE
ASKING YOURSELF

08:59.072 --> 09:01.006
WHY WREN FELT
THE NEED TO--

09:03.176 --> 09:04.476
I'M SORRY.

09:04.478 --> 09:06.211
OH, I'M NOT PERFECT,

09:06.213 --> 09:09.314
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE ACCUSED
OF SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T DO!

09:09.316 --> 09:10.715
OH, STOP, PLEASE,
BOTH OF YOU!

09:10.717 --> 09:12.083
GO GET DRESSED
FOR SCHOOL.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.451
YOU CAN TAKE
YOUR MUFFIN TO GO.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.898
AH! TOTALLY LOVE
THIS COLOR.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.401
WE SHOULD'VE STOCKED UP
ON A FEW MORE TUBES.

09:29.403 --> 09:32.337
WELL, I ONLY HAVE
TWO HANDS. KEEP IT.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.706
WHY, IS YOUR MOM
ASKING TO SEE RECEIPTS?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.677
SEAN!

09:38.679 --> 09:40.579
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

09:40.581 --> 09:43.481
NOTHIN'. NOEL'S JUST
OUT OF CONTROL.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.983
MM, YOU SMELL GOOD.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.484
Noel: SAVE SOMETHING
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.

09:46.486 --> 09:47.652
WHAT'S TOMORROW NIGHT?

09:47.654 --> 09:49.154
NOEL'S PARENTS
ARE LEAVING TOWN.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.989
IT MEANS THE PARTY OF THE YEAR
IS OFFICIALLY ON.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.457
THINK BIG, THINK WILD,

09:52.459 --> 09:54.326
THINK PARENTAL UNITS
IN A DIFFERENT TIME ZONE.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.661
I GOTTA GET
TO PRACTICE.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.263
SAVE THAT SMELL.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.135
SO, THE PRESSURE'S ON.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.637
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:05.639 --> 10:08.306
NOT ALL OF US HAVE A SEAN
TO WEAR TO THAT PARTY,

10:08.308 --> 10:10.475
AND I'M NOT GONNA SPEND
THE NIGHT GUARDING THE BUSHES

10:10.477 --> 10:12.143
SO YOU CAN JUMP
EACH OTHER'S BONES.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.512
OKAY, WE'RE NOT GONNA BE
DOING IT IN THE BUSHES.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.882
WHATEVER. HAVE YOU GUYS
EVEN DONE IT YET?

10:17.884 --> 10:19.718
IT'S NOT A RACE, MONA.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.120
OKAY, MOM, SERIOUSLY.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.989
NO ONE'S PUSHING YOU
TO BE NATTY HO,

10:23.991 --> 10:26.157
BUT YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
GOING OUT FOR MONTHS.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.826
IF YOU'RE NOT TOGETHER
IN THAT WAY,

10:27.828 --> 10:29.794
HOW DO YOU KNOW
YOU'RE TOGETHER-TOGETHER?

10:37.437 --> 10:39.404
I WAS GOING TO OFFER
YOU A RIDE,

10:39.406 --> 10:42.007
BUT YOUR BIKE'S FASTER
THAN MY CAR.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.142
I PASSED YOU?
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE YOU.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.212
I SAW YOU.
YOU TOOK THAT CORNER
ON ONE WHEEL.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.280
GOT YA!

10:49.282 --> 10:51.383
BEN, STOP.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.852
FINE. I CAN WAIT
ONE MORE DAY.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.720
WELL, YOU GUYS HEARD, RIGHT?

10:55.722 --> 10:57.389
NOEL'S DOING HIS CABIN PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT.

10:57.391 --> 11:00.258
IS THIS ONE
OF ROSEWOOD'S
PAGAN RITUALS?

11:00.260 --> 11:03.328
KINDA. THERE WAS DEFINITELY
SOME HOWLING LAST YEAR.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.997
WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH US?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.666
PLEASE.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.801
COME.
IT'LL BE FUN.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.381
GOOD MORNING.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.749
HI.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.632
RUSSIAN HISTORY?

11:40.634 --> 11:42.434
HOW MANY AP CLASSES
DOES IT TAKE

11:42.436 --> 11:44.102
UNTIL YOUR BRAIN
EXPLODES?

11:44.104 --> 11:45.570
I'M ALREADY DROWNING
IN THERE.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.672
WHY, WHAT'S DROWNING
FOR YOU, B+?

11:47.674 --> 11:50.942
FIRST PAPER'S DUE MONDAY,
AND I'VE WRITTEN TWO WORDS--

11:50.944 --> 11:52.744
MY NAME.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.245
WELL, WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:54.247 --> 11:55.947
HEY, YOU'RE
NOT STILL FREAKED OUT

11:55.949 --> 11:58.016
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE WOODS YESTERDAY?

11:58.018 --> 12:00.852
LOOK, WE DO NOT HAVE
TO DO THIS THING
FOR ALI UNTIL--

12:00.854 --> 12:03.288
NO, IT'S NOT
JUST THAT. IT'S...

12:03.290 --> 12:04.756
IT'S EVERYTHING.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.492
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
YOUR FAMILY WANTS TO ADOPT ME?

12:21.842 --> 12:24.042
( sirens wailing )

12:31.151 --> 12:34.052
WHO IS THAT?
TOBY CAVANAUGH.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.487
WHO'S HE?

12:35.489 --> 12:38.523
HE'S, UH, AN OLDER KID
WHO USED TO GO HERE

12:38.525 --> 12:41.626
AND GOT SENT AWAY
TO A REFORM SCHOOL
OR SOMETHING.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.294
WHY?

12:43.296 --> 12:47.432
HE HAD A...
HE SET FIRE TO A GARAGE

12:47.434 --> 12:51.002
AND HIS STEPSISTER,
SHE WAS IN IT.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.338
SHOULD I BE SCARED?

12:53.340 --> 12:54.906
WHAT?

12:54.908 --> 12:56.574
NO.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.809
SEE YOU LATER.

12:57.811 --> 12:58.743
BYE.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.046
HE'S BACK, TOO?
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

13:02.048 --> 13:04.182
MAYBE SHE NEEDS HELP
SENDING RADIOACTIVE E-MAILS.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.384
YEAH, OR HE MAY BE SENDING
A FEW OF HIS OWN.

13:06.386 --> 13:07.752
Wilden: HANNA.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.923
I JUST SPOKE
WITH YOUR PRINCIPAL,

13:11.925 --> 13:13.758
ASKED HIM IF WE
COULD HAVE A CHAT.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.060
NO, I HAVE TO
GET TO CLASS.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.395
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'VE BEEN EXCUSED.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.730
LET'S GO.

13:18.732 --> 13:20.064
( school bell rings )

13:20.066 --> 13:22.433
WHAT IS GOING ON?
WHY JUST HER?

13:22.435 --> 13:24.602
PROBABLY THINKS SHE'S
THE EASIEST TO CRACK.

13:24.604 --> 13:25.837
SHE IS.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.672
WHISPER, WHISPER, WHISPER.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.008
ALMOST FEELS LIKE
ALISON'S STILL HERE.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.753
I KEEP COMING BACK
TO THIS NINTH-GRADE SHOT

13:41.755 --> 13:43.721
OF YOU AND ALISON
ON THE STEPS.

13:43.723 --> 13:44.756
WHAT ABOUT IT?

13:44.758 --> 13:46.090
WELL, YOU MADE
A LOT OF CHANGES

13:46.092 --> 13:47.892
BETWEEN NINTH
AND TENTH GRADE,

13:47.894 --> 13:49.160
LOST SOME WEIGHT,

13:49.162 --> 13:50.895
STARTED STYLING
YOUR HAIR LIKE ALISON'S.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.063
IS THAT A CRIME?

13:52.065 --> 13:53.731
NO, JUST AN OBSERVATION.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.601
NO, SHE HELPED ME
MAKE THOSE CHANGES.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.269
DID SHE, REALLY?

13:58.271 --> 13:59.771
DID SHE EVER REGRET IT?

13:59.773 --> 14:01.506
START SEEING YOU
AS HER COMPETITION?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.441
NOBODY COMPETED
WITH ALISON.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.276
YOU'D BE STUPID
TO EVEN TRY.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.444
WHY?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.112
Alison:<i> ASK HIM.</i>

14:08.114 --> 14:10.448
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
UNLESS YOU ASK.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.884
NOW.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.488
UM, SEAN?

14:17.490 --> 14:20.458
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT
THE PARTY AT NOEL KAHN'S?

14:20.460 --> 14:21.593
I HEARD.
I DON'T KNOW.

14:21.595 --> 14:23.027
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT GOING,

14:23.029 --> 14:24.896
SO I'M JUST
WONDERING IF

14:24.898 --> 14:27.632
YOU WANT TO GO,
TOO, WITH ME.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.467
EVERYBODY'S GOING.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.536
SHE'S GOING. I'M GOING.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.939
WHY AREN'T YOU?

14:34.941 --> 14:38.309
OH, YEAH, NO, I...
I GUESS I AM.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.185
WHAT ABOUT
THIS GUY?

14:47.187 --> 14:49.320
DID SHE EVER
TALK ABOUT HIM?

14:49.322 --> 14:50.788
WHAT?

14:50.790 --> 14:53.458
STAY WITH ME, HANNA.
IT'S IMPORTANT.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.293
WHY? WHAT'S THE POINT?

14:55.295 --> 14:57.695
THE POINT IS I'M TRYING
TO FLESH OUT THE DETAILS
OF THAT SUMMER.

14:57.697 --> 15:00.999
SO YOU CAN ASK ME
HOW MUCH WEIGHT I LOST?

15:01.001 --> 15:03.101
BY MAKING IT LOOK
LIKE HEFTY HANNA

15:03.103 --> 15:05.503
WANTED ALISON DEAD
SO I COULD REPLACE HER?

15:05.505 --> 15:07.505
I'M NOT QUESTIONING YOU
AS A SUSPECT, HANNA.

15:07.507 --> 15:08.840
WE'RE JUST
HAVING A CHAT.

15:08.842 --> 15:11.209
BESIDES, ONE CAN'T
UNDERESTIMATE

15:11.211 --> 15:13.444
HOW MUCH THE PAST
INFORMS THE PRESENT.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.581
REALLY. SO, YOU'RE STILL
THAT SAME PARTY BOY

15:16.583 --> 15:18.950
YOU WERE IN THE CLASS
OF '96?

15:18.952 --> 15:21.419
DID YOU CALL ME DOWN
HERE TO DO KEG STANDS?

15:21.421 --> 15:23.855
WOW, LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
BEEN DOING THEIR OWN HOMEWORK.

15:23.857 --> 15:26.991
I LIKE TO KNOW WHO'S
JOINING US FOR BREAKFAST.

15:26.993 --> 15:29.994
AND, BY THE WAY,
MY TENTH-GRADE PICTURE

15:29.996 --> 15:31.896
ISN'T EVEN IN THAT YEARBOOK.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.232
I HAD MONO AND MISSED
THE DEADLINE.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.601
NOW, MY MAKEUP PICTURE
IS IN MY LIVING ROOM,

15:36.603 --> 15:38.036
WHICH YOU MUST'VE SEEN

15:38.038 --> 15:39.771
WHILE YOU WERE
WEARING A TOWEL.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.406
IS THAT HOW THE POLICE

15:41.408 --> 15:43.341
BUILD THEIR CASES
THESE DAYS?

15:47.914 --> 15:49.781
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IS THAT A NEW PHONE?

15:53.520 --> 15:57.155
IF SHE'S NOT ANSWERING TEXTS,
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SHE'S CHECKING FACEBOOK?

15:57.157 --> 15:58.456
IT'S WORTH A TRY.

15:59.693 --> 16:01.826
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:01.828 --> 16:03.494
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET AHOLD OF YOU.

16:03.496 --> 16:04.829
WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE?

16:04.831 --> 16:07.532
NOTHING, JUST THE SAME
OLD STUPID QUESTIONS.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.367
YOU WERE IN THERE
FOR AN HOUR, HANNA.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.969
WHAT ELSE DID HE ASK?

16:10.971 --> 16:12.637
NOTHING.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.807
HE JUST TOOK A COUPLE CALLS,
AND I JUST SAT THERE,

16:15.809 --> 16:17.275
WAITING FOR HIM
TO SHUT UP.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.610
WELL, IS HE GONNA
QUESTION ALL OF US
ALONE NOW?

16:19.612 --> 16:22.347
WHO KNOWS? LOOK, LET'S
DO THIS AT LUNCH, OKAY?

16:22.349 --> 16:24.615
I HAVE TO HIT THE LADIES'
BEFORE MY NEXT CLASS.

16:27.721 --> 16:28.886
IS SHE BEING WEIRD?

16:28.888 --> 16:30.488
SHE'S BEING WEIRD.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.090
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
AT LUNCH.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.358
BYE.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.337
HEY.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.805
HEY.

16:47.807 --> 16:51.309
ARE YOU HERE TO ASK ABOUT
THE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT?

16:51.311 --> 16:53.478
DO YOU HAVE PLANS
THIS WEEKEND?

16:53.480 --> 16:57.181
( chuckles ) I'M THINKING
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT
THE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.051
SO YOU DO HAVE PLANS?

17:00.053 --> 17:01.285
I DON'T.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.354
OKAY, WELL, THERE'S...

17:03.356 --> 17:05.823
THIS OPENING AT THE GALLERY
WHERE MY MOM WORKS,

17:05.825 --> 17:08.826
AND I PROMISED I'D HELP OUT,
SO IF YOU'RE FREE...

17:08.828 --> 17:10.294
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S WISE,

17:10.296 --> 17:11.996
HANGING WITH YOU
AND YOUR FOLKS,

17:11.998 --> 17:14.832
A PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCE
OVER FREE WINE?

17:14.834 --> 17:16.901
OKAY, FINE.
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.206
WHAT... IF WE
MET UP AFTERWARDS?

17:22.208 --> 17:26.044
I COULD TELL THEM I'M GOING
TO NOEL KAHN'S PARTY.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.512
( laughs )

17:27.514 --> 17:28.913
MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.214
GO TO THE PARTY.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.717
WHY... WOULD I
WANT TO DO THAT?

17:32.719 --> 17:34.652
SO YOUR CLASSMATES
DON'T SUSPECT

17:34.654 --> 17:36.654
YOU'VE LOST INTEREST
IN YOUR PEERS.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.657
TOO LATE.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.037
( knocking )

17:53.039 --> 17:54.906
EZRA, I WANT--

17:54.908 --> 17:56.374
OH. SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.443
NO, IT'S FINE.
COME IN, MRS. WELCH.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.913
UM. SO, ARE WE CLEAR
ABOUT THE HOMEWORK
ASSIGNMENT?

18:01.915 --> 18:05.283
YES, TOTALLY.
IF I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,
I'LL REACH OUT TO YOU.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.684
GREAT.
THANK YOU, MR. FITZ.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.927
Wren: DID YOUR SISTER
SEND YOU HERE?

18:15.929 --> 18:17.295
GOD, NO.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.964
SHE HAS NO IDEA
I EVEN CALLED YOU.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.766
THINGS WERE NEVER
GREAT BETWEEN US,

18:21.768 --> 18:25.336
BUT... NOW IT'S LIKE
THE<i> HURT LOCKER.</i>

18:25.338 --> 18:27.472
IT JUST GETS WORSE
EVERY DAY.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.307
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.642
SO, YOU'RE LIVING
HERE NOW?

18:31.644 --> 18:34.545
SQUATTING. IT'S NOT
EXACTLY THE HASTINGS MANOR,

18:34.547 --> 18:36.614
BUT I HAVE A WHOLE SOFA
TO MYSELF.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.516
WREN, I NEED YOUR HELP.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.184
WE ONLY HAVE
THE ONE SOFA.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.486
CAN YOU SLEEP
ON A PING-PONG TABLE?

18:43.756 --> 18:46.924
LOOK, I NEED YOU TO TELL
THEM WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

18:46.926 --> 18:50.495
I TRIED. THEY WON'T
RETURN MY PHONE CALLS.

18:50.497 --> 18:54.132
I KNOW I'M NOT
COMPLETELY INNOCENT
IN ALL OF THIS.

18:54.134 --> 18:57.502
I'VE DONE A LOT OF STUFF
THAT I'M NOT PROUD OF,

18:57.504 --> 18:59.871
BUT NOT THAT NIGHT.

18:59.873 --> 19:01.772
I NEVER WANTED YOU GUYS
TO BREAK UP.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.811
I DON'T THINK IT
WOULD MATTER WHAT I SAID.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.980
ONCE YOUR PARENTS
DECIDE HOW THEY'RE

19:08.982 --> 19:11.215
GONNA THINK OF SOMEONE,
IT'S ROYAL DECREE--

19:11.217 --> 19:12.583
YOU'RE BRILLIANT,
YOU'RE RUBBISH.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.318
THERE'S VERY LITTLE
IN BETWEEN.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.687
COULD YOU AT LEAST
TRY MY DAD AGAIN?

19:16.689 --> 19:19.290
SPENCER, PUT
YOUR EFFORTS ELSEWHERE.

19:19.292 --> 19:22.093
MY GUESS IS THAT
YOUR JAIL SENTENCE
WILL BE COMMUTED

19:22.095 --> 19:24.228
THE MOMENT YOU SCORE
A WINNING POINT
OR ACE A TEST.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.866
THIS MIGHT NOT BE
THAT SIMPLE.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.001
GIVE IT TIME.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.873
LOOK, I KNOW I MADE
A BLOODY MESS OF IT,

19:35.875 --> 19:38.910
AND I'M SORRY FOR PUTTING
YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

19:38.912 --> 19:40.578
BUT PERHAPS
MY REAL MISTAKE

19:40.580 --> 19:42.079
WAS FALLING
FOR THE WRONG SISTER.

19:48.454 --> 19:49.987
UM, I SHOULD GO.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.756
IT'S JUST THE 4:00 TRAIN,

19:51.758 --> 19:54.292
AND I HAVE THIS HUGE PAPER
TO WRITE THAT'S DUE MONDAY.

19:54.294 --> 19:57.195
YOU GOTTA GET BACK
TO THAT WRETCHED PLACE
CALLED HOME. RIGHT.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.948
( door opens )

20:19.219 --> 20:21.252
( locker thuds )

20:21.254 --> 20:23.087
HELLO?

20:23.089 --> 20:25.790
HELLO? ANYBODY HERE?

20:27.961 --> 20:29.360
HELLO?

20:32.031 --> 20:33.864
( gasps ) OH, GOD!

20:33.866 --> 20:35.733
DAMN! YOU'RE JUMPY.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.102
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?
WALKED.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.371
YEAH, WELL, IF SOMEBODY
CATCHES YOU...

20:40.373 --> 20:41.939
I'LL TAKE
MY CHANCES.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.976
BESIDES, WE NEED
SOME ALONE TIME.

20:44.978 --> 20:47.612
I... NEED TO GET DRESSED.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.447
DON'T BOTHER.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.116
I CAN'T DO THIS NOW.
MY MOM'S EXPECTING ME.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.618
WHAT'S UP, EM?

20:53.620 --> 20:55.920
LAST WEEK YOU WERE
ALL OVER ME IN MY CAR.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.622
THIS WEEK I'M
SOME MARCHING BAND GEEK

20:57.624 --> 21:00.224
WITH FUNYUN BREATH.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:00.226 --> 21:02.059
NOTHING. I'VE JUST...

21:02.061 --> 21:03.961
GOT A LOT
ON MY MIND, OKAY?

21:03.963 --> 21:05.796
ALL RIGHT.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.531
MAYBE YOU NEED
TO RELAX.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.636
BEN, I CAN'T
DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.105
WHAT?
SERIOUSLY, STOP IT.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.107
HEY, YOU'RE ACTING STRANGE.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.342
BEN, GET OFF ME!

21:18.344 --> 21:19.710
GET OFF!

21:21.547 --> 21:22.947
STOP IT!

21:24.984 --> 21:26.183
( blow lands )

21:26.185 --> 21:28.219
THAT'S ENOUGH!

21:28.221 --> 21:29.987
GUYS, STOP.
IS THIS CREEP
A FRIEND OF YOURS?

21:29.989 --> 21:32.023
IS HE THE REASON YOU'RE
ACTING LIKE THIS?

21:32.025 --> 21:33.891
BEN, GET OVER
YOURSELF, OKAY?

21:33.893 --> 21:35.126
GET OVER<i> MYSELF?</i>

21:35.128 --> 21:36.594
IT'S DONE. WE'RE OVER.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.010
THE OWNER REFUSES
TO USE A COMPUTER,

21:53.012 --> 21:54.679
WHICH IS ONLY
MILDLY IRRITATING,

21:54.681 --> 21:56.447
BECAUSE HALF OF
THESE CONTACTS DIED

21:56.449 --> 21:57.848
DURING THE REAGAN
ADMINISTRATION.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.050
( laughs )

22:00.586 --> 22:02.420
THAT WAS FAST.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.088
THIS IS
MY DAUGHTER, ARIA,

22:04.090 --> 22:05.289
ALSO KNOWN
AS MY SAVIOR,

22:05.291 --> 22:06.457
BECAUSE
WHEN I GOT HERE,

22:06.459 --> 22:08.092
THERE WERE
ABOUT THREE CUPS.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.327
THANK YOU, MY DEAR.

22:09.329 --> 22:10.528
UH, THIS IS MEREDITH.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.862
SHE WORKS WITH YOUR DAD.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.998
WE'VE MET, ACTUALLY.
NICE TO SEE YOU.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.666
MEREDITH JUST WANDERED IN.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.302
SHE'S LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY
WHO SHOWS ALTERNATIVE ART.

22:18.304 --> 22:20.004
OH, AND YOUR MOTHER'S
BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.372
THANK YOU SO MUCH, ELLA.

22:21.374 --> 22:22.973
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.
SO, WE'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT?

22:22.975 --> 22:24.308
MM-HMM.
OKAY.

22:24.310 --> 22:25.576
TONIGHT?

22:25.578 --> 22:27.745
YEAH, I INVITED HER
TO THE OPENING,

22:27.747 --> 22:31.048
WHICH MAY BE A SUCCESS NOW
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO EAT
COBB SALAD WITH OUR FINGERS.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.416
THANK YOU.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

22:32.418 --> 22:33.851
SURE. BYE-BYE.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.522
YOU CAN'T COME TONIGHT.

22:38.524 --> 22:39.623
WHY NOT?

22:39.625 --> 22:41.859
YOU KNOW WHY NOT,
AND SO DO I...

22:41.861 --> 22:43.361
BUT MY MOM DOESN'T.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.529
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

22:45.531 --> 22:48.899
LOOK, I SAW THE WAY
YOU WERE LOOKING
AT MY DAD YESTERDAY.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.068
I HAVE EYES, SO JUST FIND
SOMEONE WHO'S AVAILABLE.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.236
MY DAD ISN'T.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.786
HOW ARE YOU GETTING HOME?

23:08.788 --> 23:11.522
IF THERE'S ANY DRINKING,
I WILL PICK YOU UP.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.257
OR I COULD TAKE YOU,

23:13.259 --> 23:15.826
IF YOU DON'T MIND RIDING
IN THE SQUAD CAR.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.028
I WOULDN'T USE THE CUFFS.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.664
I'LL BE FINE, THANKS.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.702
WHAT? IT WAS A JOKE.

23:28.307 --> 23:30.941
SO, HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM THE STORE?

23:30.943 --> 23:33.077
ARE THEY PROSECUTING
OR--OR NOT?

23:33.079 --> 23:34.578
NO, I HAVEN'T HEARD,

23:34.580 --> 23:36.580
BUT I HAVE A CALL
INTO THEM, SO...

23:58.538 --> 24:00.438
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:00.440 --> 24:03.107
WHERE HAVE I SEEN
THIS BEFORE?

24:03.109 --> 24:04.608
IT'S NICE.
IS THAT FROM YOU?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.777
ALISON GAVE IT TO HER.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.245
THAT'S RIGHT.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.880
SHE MENTIONED THAT
AT SCHOOL TODAY.

24:09.882 --> 24:12.116
WHY WERE YOU
AT HER SCHOOL?

24:12.118 --> 24:14.151
I WAS INTERVIEWING
HANNA AGAIN.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.753
THAT'S MY DAY JOB.

24:15.755 --> 24:18.589
WHY WAS MY KID BEING
QUESTIONED A SECOND TIME?

24:18.591 --> 24:20.057
BECAUSE SHE'S CLOSE
TO THE VICTIM,

24:20.059 --> 24:21.425
AND BECAUSE KIDS
KEEP SECRETS.

24:21.427 --> 24:23.761
( scoffs ) NOT MINE.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.429
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING
SHE KNOWS MORE

24:25.431 --> 24:27.598
THAN SHE'S LETTING ON,
YOU'RE OUT OF LINE.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.300
STICKY FINGERS
IS A LONG WAY OFF

24:29.302 --> 24:30.634
FROM WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.303
EASY, MAMA BEAR.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.971
IT'S JUST A ROUTINE
INVESTIGATION.

24:33.973 --> 24:37.308
WELL, THEN YOU'RE GONNA
NEED A SEARCH WARRANT

24:37.310 --> 24:38.909
TO GO THROUGH HER PURSE.

24:49.222 --> 24:50.921
SO, CAN I HELP WITH DINNER?

24:50.923 --> 24:52.590
YEAH.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.028
HAVE IT SOMEPLACE ELSE.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.632
BREAKFAST, TOO.

25:10.243 --> 25:11.876
( music playing )

25:17.517 --> 25:18.916
OOH!

25:21.821 --> 25:23.854
( ball thunks )
OH, YEAH!

25:23.856 --> 25:25.523
AGAIN?

25:25.525 --> 25:26.924
UNREAL. LET'S GO.
SERVE UP.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.901
COME ON, LIGHTEN UP.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.636
I SHOULD'VE
STAYED HOME.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.704
WHY, 'CAUSE YOU BROKE UP
WITH SOMEBODY?

25:40.706 --> 25:42.873
WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO,
SPEND THE REST

25:42.875 --> 25:44.642
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR
HIDING UNDER YOUR BED?

25:50.583 --> 25:52.550
Emily:
THERE HE IS.

25:52.552 --> 25:55.286
Maya: DID YOU DO THAT
TO HIS FACE? DAMN.

25:55.288 --> 25:57.721
IT'S A GOOD COLOR
ON HIM.

25:57.723 --> 25:58.856
HI, EM.

26:00.359 --> 26:01.792
YO, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

26:06.232 --> 26:08.432
SO, YOU DECIDED
TO COME AFTER ALL.

26:08.434 --> 26:11.635
YEAH, I DID.

26:11.637 --> 26:13.137
JUST NOT WITH YOU.

27:09.562 --> 27:11.662
( beeps )

27:36.288 --> 27:39.023
HEY. HI, HOW
WAS THE CLUB?

27:39.025 --> 27:43.527
CHILLY. NOBODY WHO WORKS THERE
CAN FIGURE OUT A THERMOSTAT.

27:43.529 --> 27:44.995
DID YOU EAT?

27:44.997 --> 27:47.164
YEAH, I MADE SOME PASTA
IF YOU'RE HUNGRY.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.666
I'M NOT EATING PASTA.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.601
I DON'T NEED TO BE
DEPRESSED AND FAT.

27:50.603 --> 27:52.136
GOOD POINT.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.772
I'LL MAKE A SALAD.
LET ME GET OUT
OF THESE CLOTHES.

27:57.410 --> 28:00.110
WREN CALLED.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.946
HE TOLD ME YOU WENT
INTO THE CITY YESTERDAY
TO MEET HIM.

28:02.948 --> 28:06.250
IT WAS STRANGE.

28:06.252 --> 28:09.019
AT FIRST I WASN'T SURE
WHY HE WAS TELLING ME THIS,

28:09.021 --> 28:11.655
BUT THEN I REALIZED
HE'S STILL TRYING

28:11.657 --> 28:14.158
TO COVER HIS TRACKS
AND YOURS.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.560
LIKE I'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
YOU TOOK A TRAIN DOWN THERE

28:16.562 --> 28:19.096
JUST TO CLEAR YOUR NAME?

28:19.098 --> 28:20.931
YOU TWO DESERVE EACH OTHER.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.933
I THOUGHT I WAS PATHETIC.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.457
OOH! DAMN.

28:46.459 --> 28:48.559
DID YOU SEE THAT?

28:48.561 --> 28:50.227
AWESOME.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.029
LOOK, CAN THIS
BE YOUR LAST GAME?

29:10.649 --> 29:12.783
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

29:16.722 --> 29:18.922
HE TACKLED BEN?
WHAT WAS TOBY EVEN DOING

29:18.924 --> 29:20.257
IN THE GIRLS'
LOCKER ROOM?

29:20.259 --> 29:21.525
WHY ARE YOU SHOCKED?

29:21.527 --> 29:22.826
TOBY'S A PERV.

29:22.828 --> 29:24.461
WE CAUGHT HIM PEEPING
THROUGH THE WINDOWS,

29:24.463 --> 29:25.696
WATCHING US UNDRESS.

29:25.698 --> 29:27.297
ALISON'S THE ONE
WHO SAW HIM DO THAT.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.699
WE NEVER DID.

29:28.701 --> 29:30.267
WHAT'S UP?

29:30.269 --> 29:32.703
TOBY CAVANAUGH GOT
INTO A FIGHT WITH BEN
OVER EMILY.

29:32.705 --> 29:35.205
IT WASN'T OVER ME. GOD.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.608
LOOK, HE JUST... SAVED ME.

29:37.610 --> 29:38.876
FOR WHAT, HIMSELF?

29:38.878 --> 29:40.077
EW.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.745
IF WE HADN'T ASKED
YOU ABOUT BEN,

29:41.747 --> 29:44.047
WOULD YOU HAVE
TOLD US ABOUT THIS?

29:44.049 --> 29:46.383
TOBY IS NOT
A GOOD GUY, EMILY.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.552
HE COULD BE
SERIOUSLY DANGEROUS.

29:48.554 --> 29:51.355
IF HE'S SUCH A BAD GUY,
WHY'D HE TAKE THE FALL FOR US?

29:55.761 --> 29:57.795
IS THIS ANOTHER SECRET?

29:57.797 --> 29:59.396
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING
THAT WE DON'T?

29:59.398 --> 30:00.898
GUYS, WHY DON'T WE
JUST, LIKE, CHILL

30:00.900 --> 30:02.599
AND TALK ABOUT THIS
SOMEWHERE ELSE?

30:02.601 --> 30:04.168
WHEN WE'RE ALONE.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.103
I... DON'T EVEN KNOW

30:06.105 --> 30:07.871
WHAT "JUST US"
MEANS ANYMORE.

30:07.873 --> 30:10.574
YEAH, UH...

30:10.576 --> 30:12.609
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
TOMORROW, OKAY?

30:12.611 --> 30:14.778
ARE WE STILL MEETING
UP AT THE SHED?

30:14.780 --> 30:16.747
YEAH. YEAH, SURE.
WHY NOT?

30:20.152 --> 30:21.485
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

30:21.487 --> 30:23.387
THE GALLERY.
I PROMISED MY MOM.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.860
HAVE YOU CHECKED OUT
THE PHOTO BOOTH
THEY'VE GOT IN THERE?

30:29.862 --> 30:32.129
NO. SHOW ME THE BOOTH.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.630
I'LL MAKE SURE
EVERYBODY KNOWS!

31:09.301 --> 31:11.235
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
TO STAY OVER THERE

31:11.237 --> 31:12.903
AND LET ME
TAKE CARE OF THIS?

31:12.905 --> 31:14.371
WHAT DID YOU HEAR?
NOTHING. NOTHING.

31:17.443 --> 31:19.977
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED TO JENNA?

31:19.979 --> 31:23.013
IT'S DONE. WE WERE
NEVER HERE. LET'S GO.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.281
BUT...

31:24.283 --> 31:25.816
BUT WHAT?

31:25.818 --> 31:27.885
WHAT IF WE SAID
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT?

31:27.887 --> 31:30.320
NO, WE'RE NOT TELLING
ANYBODY ANYTHING.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.256
DAMN IT, HANNA.

31:32.258 --> 31:35.092
DON'T MAKE ME SORRY
I EVER INCLUDED YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

31:35.094 --> 31:37.094
I HAVE GONE
OUT OF MY WAY TO BRING

31:37.096 --> 31:38.662
YOUR BIG, WANNABE BUTT
INTO THIS GROUP.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.297
YOU BETTER KEEP
YOUR MOUTH SHUT,

31:40.299 --> 31:42.633
UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO BACK
TO SPENDING YOUR WEEKENDS ALONE,

31:42.635 --> 31:44.701
<i> DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION</i>
AND A JUMBO BAG OF CHIPS.

31:44.703 --> 31:46.503
ALI, STOP IT!

31:46.505 --> 31:47.838
JUST LEAVE HER ALONE.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.076
I'M SORRY, HANNA.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.879
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

31:55.881 --> 31:57.447
I'M JUST FREAKED OUT, GUYS.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.850
THIS IS BAD. REALLY BAD.

31:59.852 --> 32:01.385
I NEVER WOULD'VE DONE IT

32:01.387 --> 32:03.854
IF I THOUGHT SOMEONE
WAS IN THERE.

32:03.856 --> 32:07.591
I JUST-- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN...

32:07.593 --> 32:08.659
TO US.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.029
CAN WE JUST GO?

32:12.031 --> 32:12.996
COME ON.

32:17.202 --> 32:20.404
( chirping )

32:34.186 --> 32:36.019
WHAT MADE YOU
COME UP HERE?

32:36.021 --> 32:38.889
I HAD SOME TIME TO KILL
WHILE YOU WERE FOOSBALLING.

32:38.891 --> 32:41.491
HEY, I WAS ON A ROLL!

32:41.493 --> 32:43.860
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
CONTACT SPORTS.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.684
READY?
WAIT. I GOTTA PREPARE.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.586
IF THIS
COMES OUT DECENT,

33:09.588 --> 33:11.621
I'M GONNA CUT MINE OUT
AND REPLACE THE ONE

33:11.623 --> 33:12.889
ON MY DRIVER'S LICENSE.

33:12.891 --> 33:14.324
YEAH, THEY'RE
ALWAYS SCARY.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.927
NO, I SKIPPED SCARY.
I WENT STRAIGHT TO SNOOKI.

33:16.929 --> 33:19.396
( laughing )
CAN I SEE IT?

33:19.398 --> 33:21.331
COME ON, I'LL
SHOW YOU MINE.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.966
IT'S PROBABLY WORSE.

33:22.968 --> 33:24.501
NO WAY.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.670
WHAT COULD BE WRONG
WITH YOURS?

33:26.672 --> 33:28.572
YOU'RE CRAZY
BEAUTIFUL.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.710
WHICH BUTTON
IS IT AGAIN?

33:33.712 --> 33:35.078
UM, THIS ONE.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.514
OKAY.

33:59.438 --> 34:01.671
THINK THERE'S
ANY PIZZA LEFT?

34:01.673 --> 34:03.673
WHERE ARE THE PICTURES?

34:03.675 --> 34:06.476
DAMN, I TOLD YOU
I BREAK CAMERAS.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.645
NO, SERIOUSLY,
WHERE ARE THEY?

34:10.416 --> 34:13.016
PROBABLY JUST
RAN OUT OF PAPER.

34:13.018 --> 34:14.785
COME ON.
LET'S EAT SOMETHING.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.492
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

34:22.494 --> 34:23.994
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

34:27.199 --> 34:29.199
HANNA, PLEASE STOP.

34:29.201 --> 34:30.534
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

34:30.536 --> 34:32.369
I MEAN, YOU SAID YOU
WANTED IT TO BE SPECIAL.

34:32.371 --> 34:33.737
THIS IS PRETTY SPECIAL,

34:33.739 --> 34:36.073
IF YOU'RE NOT AFRAID
OF SPIDERS.

34:36.075 --> 34:37.040
MM.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.879
OH, IT'S...

34:42.881 --> 34:45.549
I DON'T WANNA DO THIS
RIGHT NOW.

34:45.551 --> 34:47.851
WELL, THEN, WHERE
DO YOU WANT TO GO?

34:47.853 --> 34:49.586
WE CAN'T EXACTLY
AFFORD A WEEKEND

34:49.588 --> 34:51.021
AT A FIVE-STAR
HOTEL.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.326
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHERE.

34:56.328 --> 34:57.694
THEN WHAT IS IT ABOUT?

35:03.368 --> 35:05.535
IS THIS ABOUT ME?

35:05.537 --> 35:08.405
TELL ME. TELL ME WHY
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING,

35:08.407 --> 35:10.640
AND DON'T START
QUOTING SCRIPTURE.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.075
WHY ARE YOU ACTING
LIKE THIS?

35:12.077 --> 35:13.243
LIKE WHAT?

35:13.245 --> 35:14.611
LIKE YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING TO PROVE.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.513
BECAUSE MAYBE I DO!

35:16.515 --> 35:17.981
MAYBE YOU STILL
THINK OF ME

35:17.983 --> 35:19.683
AS THAT DUMPY
JUNIOR HIGH GIRL

35:19.685 --> 35:21.151
WHO LAUGHED
AT ALL YOUR JOKES

35:21.153 --> 35:22.619
AND GAVE YOU
CUTS IN LINE

35:22.621 --> 35:24.421
AND FOLLOWED YOU AROUND
LIKE SOME GROUPIE.

35:24.423 --> 35:26.389
NO, I-- I LIKED THAT GIRL.

35:29.061 --> 35:32.295
BUT--BUT THIS ONE
SEEMS... DESPERATE.

35:36.101 --> 35:37.968
ANY GUY
AT THIS PARTY

35:37.970 --> 35:39.703
WOULD BE HAPPY
TO BE WITH ME.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.473
WHY AREN'T YOU?

35:43.475 --> 35:46.176
WE ALREADY TALKED
ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

35:59.791 --> 36:02.826
TAKE THIS.
IT'S COLD UP HERE.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.594
LEAVE ME ALONE.

36:04.596 --> 36:06.563
I DON'T WANT
YOUR STUPID JACKET.

36:32.157 --> 36:33.456
Ella: THANK YOU.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.724
Byron: WELL, YOU ARE.

36:34.726 --> 36:37.093
HE'S JUST SAYING THAT
'CAUSE HE HAS TO.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.215
DID YOU FORGET
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT?

36:58.217 --> 37:00.450
YOU TALKED. I LISTENED.

37:00.452 --> 37:03.787
WHAT DIDN'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOW.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.589
LISTEN, SWEETIE,
I'M NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.090
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY SAY IN THIS.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.440
( message tone beeps )

37:57.509 --> 37:58.742
HANNA!

37:58.744 --> 38:00.710
HANNA, WHAT'S UP?

38:00.712 --> 38:01.711
HANNA!

38:02.914 --> 38:05.015
WAIT, WHY ARE YOU
TAKING SEAN'S CAR?

38:05.017 --> 38:06.149
HANNA!

38:24.703 --> 38:25.835
HEY.

38:27.239 --> 38:29.039
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE HELPING OUT
AT THE GALLERY.

38:29.041 --> 38:31.608
I WAS.

38:31.610 --> 38:34.144
CAN I COME IN?

38:34.146 --> 38:37.580
I'M NOT SURE
IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

38:40.519 --> 38:43.219
I'M S... I'M SORRY.
THIS WAS...

38:43.221 --> 38:45.021
A MISTAKE.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE.

38:47.326 --> 38:49.292
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.364
I'LL SEE YOU ON MONDAY.

38:56.201 --> 38:57.200
NO, WAIT.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.238
ARE YOU-- ARE YOU OKAY?

39:02.240 --> 39:03.740
DO YOU NEED ME
TO DRIVE YOU HOME?

39:05.744 --> 39:08.078
THAT'S THE LAST PLACE
I WANT TO BE.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.879
WHY?

39:09.881 --> 39:11.147
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:14.553 --> 39:16.753
CAN-- CAN WE JUST...

39:18.390 --> 39:20.390
BE HERE FOR A MINUTE?

39:39.644 --> 39:42.779
( car alarm blaring )

39:46.585 --> 39:48.418
( steam hissing )

39:59.531 --> 40:00.797
Emily: HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.350
HI.

40:20.352 --> 40:24.087
I... I NEVER GOT
A CHANCE TO...

40:27.259 --> 40:29.926
I JUST WANTED
TO THANK YOU.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.394
I MEAN...

40:33.465 --> 40:36.733
I'M NOT SURE WHY YOU...

40:36.735 --> 40:39.068
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

40:43.408 --> 40:44.908
AGAIN, THANKS.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.819
Jenna: WHY IS SHE
THANKING YOU?

40:59.791 --> 41:01.858
WHY IS SHE
THANKING YOU?

41:01.860 --> 41:03.493
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

41:16.741 --> 41:19.476
Spencer: SO SHE COULD
HAVE IT OUT WITH TOBY.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.211
ALI HAD SOMETHING ON HIM.

41:21.213 --> 41:24.414
BESIDES BEING A TOTAL PERV
WHO PEEPED IN OUR WINDOWS?

41:24.416 --> 41:26.082
YEAH, SOMETHING
WAY BIGGER,

41:26.084 --> 41:28.251
AND SHE WAS THREATENING
TO TELL EVERYBODY.

41:28.253 --> 41:30.753
THAT'S WHY HE TOOK
THE FALL FOR US.

41:30.755 --> 41:33.356
Aria: WHY ARE YOU WAITING
UNTIL NOW TO TELL US?

41:33.358 --> 41:37.293
I DON'T KNOW.
ALI MADE ME PROMISE,

41:37.295 --> 41:40.797
AND... I GUESS
I WAS SCARED.

41:40.799 --> 41:43.199
I THOUGHT IF WE NEVER
TALKED ABOUT THAT NIGHT AGAIN,

41:43.201 --> 41:45.034
IT WOULD JUST GO AWAY.

41:45.036 --> 41:47.370
WELL, IT'S NOT
GOING AWAY.

41:47.372 --> 41:49.539
NOT UNLESS WE TOSS OUR PHONES
AND JOIN THE NAVY.

41:51.510 --> 41:53.343
LOOK, THERE'S
FOUR OF US

41:53.345 --> 41:55.378
AND ONE FREAK
SENDING MESSAGES.

41:55.380 --> 41:57.046
IF WE JUST TALK
TO EACH OTHER

41:57.048 --> 41:58.882
LIKE THIS, I FEEL
LIKE IT MAKES IT

41:58.884 --> 42:00.116
EASIER TO DEAL
WITH EVERYTHING.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.317
Aria: I THINK
EMILY'S RIGHT.

42:01.319 --> 42:02.752
THERE'S WAY
TOO MANY SECRETS.

42:02.754 --> 42:04.554
WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS IN
THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

42:04.556 --> 42:06.723
WE SHOULD DO IT WHERE
WE CAN SEE IT EVERY DAY.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.424
YOU MEAN, LIKE,
SOMEWHERE IN SCHOOL?

42:08.426 --> 42:11.027
NO. IN TOWN.
WE SHOULD ASK IF WE CAN
PUT A BENCH SOMEWHERE.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.562
WAIT, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

42:12.564 --> 42:15.899
WHOEVER DID THIS TO HER,
IF THEY'RE STILL IN ROSEWOOD,

42:15.901 --> 42:18.201
WE SHOULD MAKE THEM
LOOK AT IT EVERY DAY, TOO.

42:20.505 --> 42:21.704
WHAT, YOU HATE
THE IDEA?

42:21.706 --> 42:23.506
NO. NO, I JUST...

42:23.508 --> 42:25.108
I HAD A ROUGH NIGHT.

42:25.110 --> 42:27.410
( rustling, stick cracks )

42:44.663 --> 42:45.695
LOOK.

42:50.268 --> 42:52.302
IS THAT YOURS?

42:52.304 --> 42:53.870
ALISON'S.
