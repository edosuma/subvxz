WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.253
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.336 --> 00:06.047
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.131 --> 00:07.424
- [sighs]

00:07.507 --> 00:09.092
WELL, THANK GOD
WILBUR'S PRESENT

00:09.175 --> 00:11.970
ARRIVED FROM FRANCE IN TIME
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

00:12.053 --> 00:14.222
WHAT DID YOU ALWAYS DREAM
OF HAVING

00:14.305 --> 00:17.434
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL
GROWING UP IN POLAND?

00:17.517 --> 00:20.770
- FOOD.

00:20.854 --> 00:24.065
- BUT A CLOSE SECOND
MUST'VE BEEN

00:24.149 --> 00:27.736
AN 18TH CENTURY BEAUX ARTES
MARIONETTE THEATER.

00:27.819 --> 00:30.447
HUH?

00:30.530 --> 00:33.491
- OH, NO.
THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE IN FRENCH.

00:33.575 --> 00:37.370
- WHAT'S FRENCH
FOR "PUPPETS ARE CREEPY"?

00:38.538 --> 00:42.625
IT LOOKS
JUST LIKE YOU.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.169
- THERE IS
A RESEMBLANCE.

00:44.252 --> 00:48.798
- WELL, THIS FREAKISH CREATURE
LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ME.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.676
- HEY! WHERE'D YOU GET
THE VICTORIA PUPPET?

00:53.553 --> 00:55.096
- WHAT'S ALL THAT?

00:55.180 --> 00:56.765
- OH, ALL THESE TOYS
WERE OVER AT ELKA'S PLACE.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.308
- WE'LL, I DID A LOT
OF BABY-SITTING

00:58.391 --> 00:59.642
WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.686
- WAS IT HARD
PUSHING A STROLLER AROUND

01:01.770 --> 01:05.899
BEFORE THE INVENTION
OF THE WHEEL?

01:05.982 --> 01:07.942
- WOW, THESE TOYS
ARE REALLY VINTAGE

01:08.026 --> 01:10.028
AND KIND OF INAPPROPRIATE.

01:10.111 --> 01:13.490
"DRUNKEN IRISH POTATO HEAD"?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.992
- THEY HAD
A GREAT SLOGAN.

01:16.075 --> 01:21.790
"I-RISH
I WAS DRINKIN'."

01:21.873 --> 01:22.999
- HEY, EVERYBODY.
HOW'S THE BIRTHDAY GOIN'?

01:23.082 --> 01:26.044
- OH, WE'RE BUILDING WILBUR
HIS FIRST MARIONETTE THEATER.

01:26.127 --> 01:29.923
- AH, ON THE THEORY HE'S REALLY
A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL?

01:33.551 --> 01:34.969
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.513
WE'VE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER
AND EVERYTHING,

01:36.596 --> 01:38.389
AND WE HAVEN'T HAD THE TALK
ABOUT HAVING KIDS...

01:38.473 --> 01:40.225
- WHAT?

01:40.308 --> 01:42.852
- ALTHOUGH I GUESS THAT'S PART
OF A LONGER CONVERSATION.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.855
- IT'S ALREADY LONGER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.690
- I KNOW
YOU'VE GOT GROWN KIDS,

01:47.774 --> 01:49.275
BUT, I MEAN,
IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T HURT

01:49.359 --> 01:52.111
TO AT LEAST THINK
ABOUT IT.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.699
WHOA!
GOOD ARM, BUDDY!

01:56.783 --> 01:59.869
NICE GRAB.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.371
HONEY, LOOK AT HIM.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.665
WE JUST BROUGHT HIM HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL AN HOUR AGO.

02:03.748 --> 02:06.876
WE'RE ALREADY
PLAYING CATCH!

02:06.960 --> 02:09.211
- HE'S INCREDIBLE,
JUST LIKE HIS FATHER.

02:09.294 --> 02:10.713
WE SHOULD HAVE
A WHOLE TEAM.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.841
WHY DON'T WE GET STARTED
RIGHT NOW?

02:12.924 --> 02:13.758
- WELL, SURE.
I THINK THAT--

02:13.842 --> 02:15.051
- SHH.

02:15.134 --> 02:16.886
I KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO WAIT SIX WEEKS

02:16.970 --> 02:18.179
AFTER HAVING A BABY
TO HAVE SEX,

02:18.263 --> 02:21.975
BUT I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH
OF YOU.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.815
WOW, HE'S REALLY
PICTURING IT.

02:28.898 --> 02:32.527
I WONDER
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.612
[groans]

02:34.696 --> 02:36.030
I CAN'T REACH
THE MAIL.

02:36.114 --> 02:39.242
- BECAUSE YOU GAINED
75 POUNDS,

02:39.325 --> 02:43.454
AND YOU'RE ONLY
TWO MONTHS PREGNANT.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.415
- THAT MAKES ME SAD.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.625
I NEED BACON.

02:47.709 --> 02:51.045
OH, HERE'S SOME.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.090
- I'M GOING
TO PLAY GOLF.

02:54.173 --> 02:57.468
LET ME KNOW
WHEN WE CAN HAVE SEX AGAIN.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.807
IT'S KIND OF FUN
TO THINK ABOUT, ISN'T IT?

03:02.891 --> 03:06.811
- SURE IS.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.114
{\an8}- MELANIE, IS ALEC
STILL HERE?

03:18.197 --> 03:20.575
{\an8}WE NEED HELP.
THIS TOY IS IMPOSSIBLE.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.784
{\an8}- NO, HE'S AT
THE HARDWARE STORE.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.120
{\an8}- OH, I HATE HARDWARE STORES.
- ME TOO.

03:24.203 --> 03:25.788
{\an8}IT'S ALL JUST STUFF YOU NEED,
NOTHING YOU EVER WANT.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.498
{\an8}- YEAH.

03:27.582 --> 03:31.628
{\an8}IT'S THE LOWEST FORM
OF SHOPPING.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.630
{\an8}- WELL, I'M KIND
OF IN SHOCK RIGHT NOW.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.256
{\an8}[laughs]
ALEC JUST ASKED ME

03:35.340 --> 03:36.424
{\an8}IF I WANTED
TO HAVE KIDS.

03:36.507 --> 03:39.302
{\an8}- REALLY?
- I KNOW!

03:39.385 --> 03:41.596
{\an8}I MEAN, I SUPPOSE
IT'S STILL TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE

03:41.679 --> 03:43.181
{\an8}WITH MODERN SCIENCE
AND EVERYTHING.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.891
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, YOU COULD ALWAYS
PULL A MADONNA

03:44.974 --> 03:48.728
{\an8}AND JUST, YOU KNOW, SNAP UP
ONE OF THOSE MALAWI BABIES.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.982
{\an8}- OR GET
A FRENCH BABY.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.069
{\an8}MAYBE HE COULD READ
THOSE INSTRUCTIONS.

03:59.238 --> 04:00.448
{\an8}- MELANIE, I KNOW.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.659
{\an8}WHY DON'T YOU AND ALEC
TAKE WILBUR TODAY?

04:02.742 --> 04:03.993
{\an8}IT'LL BE A GOOD TEST RUN
FOR HIM.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.787
{\an8}- THAT'S TRUE,
AND WHO KNOWS?

04:05.870 --> 04:09.874
{\an8}MAYBE IT'LL HELP ME FIGURE OUT
IF I WANT TO HAVE A KID TOO.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.544
{\an8}- OKAY, I'M GONNA SAY
WHAT EVERYONE'S THINKING.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.466
{\an8}JOY'S TOO OLD.

04:21.386 --> 04:25.264
{\an8}PAYBACK FOR THAT WHEEL CRACK
YOU MADE EARLIER.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.520
all: HEY.
- [laughs]

04:30.603 --> 04:35.316
YEAH, THAT IS ONE CUTE BABY
MY BOYFRIEND'S HOLDING.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.988
- MAN, I NEVER REALIZED
WHAT A CHICK MAGNET BABIES ARE.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.532
- BUT YOU DO REALIZE
IF WILBUR WAS OUR BABY,

04:42.615 --> 04:44.993
HE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY SERVE
AS A CHICK MAGNET.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.536
- WELL, OF COURSE NOT.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.876
SON, THIS IS FOR YOU.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.503
IT'S THE GLOVE I USED
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.380
- WOW.
THANKS, DAD.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.673
AFTER LUNCH,
YOU WANNA PLAY CATCH?

04:58.756 --> 05:00.383
- YOU BET.
[cell phone rings]

05:00.466 --> 05:01.551
ONE SEC.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.553
HELLO?

05:03.636 --> 05:06.723
WELL, HELLO,
MR. PRESIDENT.

05:06.806 --> 05:11.602
WHY, YES, I'D LOVE TO GO
TO THE SUPER BOWL WITH YOU...

05:11.686 --> 05:13.229
BUT I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T.

05:13.312 --> 05:16.733
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT TO DO:

05:16.816 --> 05:19.569
PLAY CATCH
WITH MY SON.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.070
[laughs]
HERO?

05:21.154 --> 05:24.574
NO, MR. PRESIDENT.
I'M JUST A DAD.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.414
I GUESS YOUR LIFE REALLY CHANGES
WHEN YOU HAVE A KID, DOESN'T IT?

05:31.497 --> 05:33.249
- OH, IT SURE DOES.

05:33.332 --> 05:37.545
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF TIME
AND A WHOLE LOT OF ENERGY.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.430
SWEETIE!
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

05:47.513 --> 05:49.307
- OUT.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.641
- TODAY IS PARENT-TEACHER
CONFERENCE DAY,

05:50.725 --> 05:51.893
AND YOU NEVER
MENTIONED IT.

05:51.976 --> 05:54.937
- BECAUSE YOU EMBARRASS ME.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.898
YOU'RE WAY OLDER
THAN ALL THE OTHER MOMS.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.983
- HONEY, COME SIT
NEXT TO ME.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.110
LET'S TALK
FOR A MINUTE.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.155
- FINE, BUT CAN WE OPEN
A BOTTLE OF WINE FIRST?

06:05.615 --> 06:06.616
- WHAT?

06:06.699 --> 06:08.951
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
I SHOULDN'T DRINK

06:09.035 --> 06:12.789
NOW THAT I'M PREGNANT.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.624
- PREGNANT?
- IT'S YOUR FAULT.

06:14.707 --> 06:15.666
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
ABOUT SEX.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.044
- I MEANT TO.

06:18.127 --> 06:22.799
I WAS JUST--
I WAS SO TIRED.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.846
- YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'D MAKE
PRETTY GOOD PARENTS.

06:28.930 --> 06:32.266
- MM-HMM.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.810
- RIGHT, WILBUR?

06:33.893 --> 06:35.019
WHERE'S WILBUR?
- OH, MY GOD!

06:35.103 --> 06:36.562
WE LOST WILBUR!

06:41.109 --> 06:42.443
- LOOK, HE COULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN FAR.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.279
HE'S ONLY CRAWLING,
AND THE FLOORS ARE STICKY.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.448
- I'LL CHECK BY THE DOOR.
YOU CHECK BY THE BAR.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.493
I'LL CHECK BY THE BAR.
YOU CHECK BY THE DOOR.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.496
- WILBUR!
HEY! HERE, CHAMP!

06:53.579 --> 06:56.499
- HEY, LITTLE FELLA.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.960
- OH!
THANK GOD YOU FOUND HIM!

06:59.043 --> 07:00.670
AND, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT A BAD PERSON.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.130
I'M REALLY RESPONSIBLE.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.215
PEOPLE WOULD SAY
THAT I AM THE LAST PERSON

07:04.298 --> 07:06.134
THEY COULD IMAGINE
LOSING A BABY IN A BAR.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.095
- NO WORRIES, YOU HAVE
A VERY CUTE GRANDSON, MA'AM.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.515
- GRANDSON?
MA'AM?

07:12.598 --> 07:13.975
HOW OLD
DO YOU THINK I AM?

07:14.058 --> 07:15.810
AND DON'T YOU DARE SAY
THE FIRST THING

07:15.893 --> 07:18.187
THAT POPS
INTO YOUR HEAD.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.231
- 26?

07:20.314 --> 07:22.775
- NOW, YOU'RE JUST BEING
AN A-HOLE.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.611
GIVE ME BACK
MY DAMN BABY.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.873
- WELL, SO MUCH
FOR MY <i> MAISON DE POUPEE.</i>

07:36.956 --> 07:40.668
- LOOKS MORE LIKE A STEAMING
PILE OF <i> POUPEE.</i>

07:44.005 --> 07:45.089
WHY DON'T WE JUST GO
TO TOYS "R" US

07:45.173 --> 07:46.507
AND PICK UP
SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

07:46.591 --> 07:47.884
- WHAT, YOU MEAN GIVE UP?

07:47.967 --> 07:51.220
- WELL, THAT WOULD BE
THE FRENCH THING TO DO.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.600
- HEY.

07:55.683 --> 07:56.392
- [high-pitched voice]
HI, HOT STUFF.

07:56.475 --> 08:00.354
- [chuckles]

08:00.438 --> 08:02.023
WILBUR'S FINALLY ASLEEP.

08:02.106 --> 08:03.900
- THAT WAS FUN
TAKING CARE OF HIM TODAY.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.568
- YEAH.
- I THINK WE DID GREAT.

08:05.651 --> 08:09.113
- WE LOST HIM IN A BAR.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.865
- WE GAVE HIM HIS SPACE.
- [chuckles]

08:10.948 --> 08:12.575
- I THINK
HE APPRECIATED IT.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.369
YOU KNOW, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I'M KINDA WIPED OUT.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.579
THAT LITTLE GUY
NEVER STOPS.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.289
- OH, YEAH,
IT'S PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTING

08:18.372 --> 08:19.707
WHEN THEY'RE LITTLE,

08:19.790 --> 08:20.791
AND, THEN,
THEY GET OLDER,

08:20.875 --> 08:23.878
AND IT'S MORE
EMOTIONALLY TIRING.

08:23.961 --> 08:26.756
YOU KNOW, HELPING THEM
WITH LIFE DECISIONS.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.967
- YEAH.
I CAN SEE THAT.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.554
- DAD.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.765
CHECK IT OUT.

08:35.847 --> 08:39.268
- "CLEVELAND'S HOTTEST DAD"?

08:39.352 --> 08:40.770
WOW!

08:40.852 --> 08:43.773
WHO EVEN KNEW THIS
WAS A THING?

08:43.856 --> 08:47.777
- DAD, THE INDIANS OFFERED ME
A MINOR LEAGUE CONTRACT.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.780
- SERIOUSLY?
WELL, THAT'S FANTASTIC!

08:50.863 --> 08:53.282
WAIT.
WHAT'S WITH THAT LOOK?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.200
- DAD...
[exhales]

08:54.283 --> 08:57.662
THE TRUTH IS
I THINK WHAT I REALLY WANT

08:57.745 --> 09:01.624
IS TO GO TO COLLEGE
AND STUDY ASTRONOMY.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.626
- WELL, THEN,
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

09:03.709 --> 09:07.630
- YOU ARE
THE GREATEST FATHER EVER.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.466
- WELL, MAYBE NOT
THE GREATEST,

09:10.549 --> 09:13.970
BUT, THEN AGAIN,
MUGS DON'T LIE.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.978
- ALEC, DID YOU INHALE
TOO MUCH HELIUM?

09:22.061 --> 09:24.647
- HUH? NO.
JUST GOT LOST IN THOUGHT.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.524
YOU KNOW, IN ALL THIS DISCUSSION
ABOUT BABIES,

09:26.607 --> 09:27.692
WE HAVEN'T TALKED
ABOUT WHAT YOUR KIDS

09:27.775 --> 09:29.986
WOULD THINK ABOUT HAVING
A NEW BABY BROTHER OR SISTER.

09:30.069 --> 09:33.656
- OOH.
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.657
WOW.
[chuckles]

09:34.740 --> 09:37.660
I JUST REALIZED THAT JENNA
IS THE SAME AGE NOW

09:37.743 --> 09:39.912
AS I WAS
WHEN I HAD HER.

09:46.043 --> 09:48.963
- HEY, ELKA,
IS MY MOM HERE?

09:50.923 --> 09:52.383
- COME HERE
AND GIVE ME A HUG, JENNA,

09:52.466 --> 09:53.259
BUT BE CAREFUL.

09:53.342 --> 09:55.052
THE PREGNANCY LEACHED
ALL THE CALCIUM

09:55.136 --> 09:58.180
OUT OF MY BONES.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.644
- SO, MOM,
HOW'S THE BABY?

10:03.728 --> 10:05.104
DID YOU COME UP
WITH A NAME YET?

10:05.187 --> 10:06.397
- "TOO TIRED."
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.065
YOU'VE GOT TIME.
- NO, THAT'S HER NAME.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.234
"TOO TIRED."

10:10.318 --> 10:11.819
WHEN THE NURSE ASKED ME
WHAT TO PUT DOWN,

10:11.902 --> 10:13.404
ALL I COULD SAY WAS
"TOO TIRED,"

10:13.487 --> 10:16.866
AND I JUST DIDN'T HAVE
THE ENERGY TO CORRECT HER.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.035
- MY FRIEND'S MOM
HAD A LATE BABY TOO.

10:19.118 --> 10:22.955
HER NAME IS
"WHY, GOD, WHY?"

10:24.373 --> 10:26.542
- IS THAT FORMULA?
- NOPE, BREAST MILK.

10:26.625 --> 10:31.213
I'M SO OLD,
I LACTATE DUST.

10:31.297 --> 10:34.216
- I HAVE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.385
JOY AND I ARE GOING
TO GO DANCING AND PICK UP GUYS

10:36.469 --> 10:37.887
BECAUSE THEY THINK
WE'RE STILL HOT.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.722
YOU WANNA COME?
- YES.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.015
BUT YOU KNOW
I CAN'T.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.058
- WE WERE TALKING
TO JENNA.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.061
SHE REMINDS US OF YOU
WHEN YOU USED TO BE FUN.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.021
- OH, YES,
YOU WERE SO MUCH FUN.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.606
- I WAS FUN, WASN'T I?

10:48.689 --> 10:50.066
EVERYBODY LIKED ME.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.401
THEY DID, DIDN'T THEY?

10:52.485 --> 10:56.781
- OKAY, LET'S GO
BEFORE IT GETS EVEN SADDER.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.534
- MOM, ARE YOU OKAY?
- NO.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.912
I HAD TIME AND ENERGY
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG,

11:02.995 --> 11:04.663
AND YOU TURNED OUT GREAT.

11:04.747 --> 11:05.539
YOU SHOULD
BE THE ONE

11:05.623 --> 11:07.625
THINKING ABOUT HAVING A BABY,
NOT ME.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.418
I DON'T WANNA BE
A MOM AGAIN.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.254
I WANNA BE A GRANDMA.
THAT'S WHERE I AM IN LIFE.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.214
- DON'T WORRY, MOM.

11:13.297 --> 11:17.885
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
A WONDERFUL GRANDMOTHER.

11:17.968 --> 11:21.889
- [groans]

11:25.059 --> 11:29.355
OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY.
I LEAKED ALL OVER YOU.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.114
- YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT KIDS,
AREN'T YOU?

11:38.197 --> 11:39.615
HAVE YOU COME
TO A DECISION?

11:39.698 --> 11:41.367
- I THINK I HAVE.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.577
YOU?

11:43.661 --> 11:46.122
- YOU GO FIRST.

11:46.205 --> 11:49.667
- WELL, I ADORE KIDS,
AND I ADORE YOU...

11:49.750 --> 11:51.293
- [laughs]

11:51.377 --> 11:54.255
- BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE DONE
THE PARENTING THING.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.924
YOU KNOW, AND I DID IT
REALLY WELL,

11:57.007 --> 11:58.134
SO I HOPE
YOU UNDERSTAND

11:58.217 --> 12:02.096
THAT I DON'T WANNA HAVE
ANY MORE KIDS.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.722
- THEN, WE'RE ON
THE EXACT SAME PAGE.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.975
- AW.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.351
I LOVE YOU.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.478
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.187
- MM.

12:15.943 --> 12:18.654
- TOSS ME THE SUPERGLUE,
WILL YOU?

12:18.737 --> 12:21.490
- WELL, IT'S FINISHED...

12:21.574 --> 12:24.493
WILBUR'S FIRST HIPSTER HAT.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.454
- OH, IT'S SO CUTE.

12:26.537 --> 12:30.166
- THESE ENGLISH INSTRUCTIONS
ARE WORSE THAN THE FRENCH ONES.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.877
WHAT OR WHO
IS ALLEN WRENCH?

12:37.256 --> 12:40.634
THIS STUPID CAR HAS MORE PIECES
THAN THE PUPPET THEATER,

12:40.718 --> 12:42.636
AND IT NEEDS
TWO "D" BATTERIES.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.723
WHERE ARE WE GONNA
GET THOSE?

12:56.609 --> 12:57.985
- FINE.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.739
I'LL TAKE THEM OUT OF MY...
PERSONAL BACK MASSAGER.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.661
- WELL, AHEM,
ALEC AND I HAD THE TALK.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.205
- WHAT DID
YOU DECIDE?

13:09.288 --> 13:10.581
- WE BOTH DECIDED...

13:10.664 --> 13:12.875
NO KIDS.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.669
- AND HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- MM, BITTERSWEET.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.047
BUT... [chuckles]
RELIEVED.

13:18.130 --> 13:22.009
- I DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY NOW
TO STAFF A BABY PROPERLY.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.264
DAY NANNY,
NIGHT NANNY,

13:27.348 --> 13:30.601
I'M EXHAUSTED ALREADY.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.729
- MY HUSBAND
DIDN'T WANT KIDS.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.272
I'VE NEVER
RESENTED IT,

13:35.356 --> 13:38.692
BUT I ALWAYS WONDERED...

13:40.819 --> 13:42.279
- MOM!

13:42.363 --> 13:46.242
- [exhales]
WHAT IS IT, MELANIE?

13:46.325 --> 13:47.535
- JOY CUT THE LEGS OFF
HER TRACKSUIT,

13:47.618 --> 13:50.788
AND SHE'S
WITH A BOY.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.250
- WE'RE GOING UPSTAIRS
TO PLAY HOUSE.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.918
MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET MARRIED FIRST.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.754
- I'M OUTTA HERE.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.465
THANKS FOR THE MILK.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.758
- JOY, WHAT HAVE
I TOLD YOU

14:02.841 --> 14:07.054
ABOUT GIVING AWAY THE MILK
FOR FREE?

14:07.137 --> 14:09.473
- I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING
LIKE THAT, MOMMY,

14:09.557 --> 14:10.474
BECAUSE I'M GOOD.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.892
I'M <i> REALLY</i> GOOD.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.269
TELL ME
HOW GOOD I AM, MOMMY?

14:13.352 --> 14:17.439
- YES, MELANIE,
YOU'RE GOOD.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.942
- HOW GOOD, MOMMY?
HOW GOOD?

14:20.025 --> 14:23.821
- THE KIND OF GOOD
THAT MAKES ME WANNA DRINK.

14:26.865 --> 14:29.618
- I HAVE
A <i> MAJOR</i> ANNOUNCEMENT.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.287
- WHAT IS IT, VICTORIA?

14:31.370 --> 14:33.831
- I AUDITIONED
FOR THE LUNCHTIME ORIGINAL MOVIE

14:33.914 --> 14:37.126
<i>RECESS CONFIDENTIAL,</i>

14:37.209 --> 14:41.630
AND I LOST THE PART TO THAT
LITTLE FREAK SUZY LUCCI.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.633
LUCCI!

14:44.717 --> 14:47.803
- I LIKE SUZY LUCCI,
AND SHE LIKES ME

14:47.886 --> 14:49.179
BECAUSE EVERYBODY LIKES ME,
RIGHT, MOMMY?

14:49.263 --> 14:50.222
DON'T THEY LIKE ME?

14:50.306 --> 14:52.516
- MOMMY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO ABOUT LUCCI?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.101
- MOMMY, WHEN IS A BOY
GOING TO LIKE ME?

14:54.184 --> 14:57.521
[overlapping dialogue]

15:01.984 --> 15:05.821
- OR...MAYBE I DODGED
A BULLET.

15:09.450 --> 15:13.996
- WELL, I BETTER GET BACK
TO MY TEPEE.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.166
- OH, NO.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.834
STUPID GLUE.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.919
I CAN'T GET THIS WINE GLASS
OUT OF MY HAND.

15:21.003 --> 15:25.341
- WELL, THAT'S HOW YOU LOOK
80% OF THE DAY ANYWAY.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.343
- I'M NEVER GONNA
GET THIS OFF,

15:27.426 --> 15:28.677
AND I'M NEVER GONNA
FINISH THIS TEPEE.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.845
- OH, COME ON!

15:29.928 --> 15:32.181
WE ARE FOUR INTELLIGENT,
CAPABLE WOMEN

15:32.264 --> 15:33.182
WHO CAN DO ANYTHING.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.475
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:34.558 --> 15:35.684
I WANT WILBUR TO KNOW
THAT WOMEN

15:35.768 --> 15:37.561
CAN DO ANYTHING
MEN CAN DO.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.983
- MAGNIFICENT.
- BRILLIANT.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.818
- AND CAN YOU BELIEVE
WE DID IT OURSELVES?

15:44.902 --> 15:48.864
- ACTUALLY, I CAN.

15:48.947 --> 15:50.783
OH, HEY, I FORGOT MY PRESENT
IN THE CAR.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.618
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- [sighs]

15:52.701 --> 15:55.746
ANOTHER TRIUMPH
FOR VICTORIA CHASE.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.373
- VICTORIA, YOU DO REALIZE

15:57.456 --> 15:59.541
CRITICS DON'T REVIEW
FIRST BIRTHDAY PARTIES.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.879
- ALL THE SAME.
KUDOS TO ME.

16:03.962 --> 16:05.381
- OH, MY GOD!
WHERE'D WILBUR GO?

16:05.464 --> 16:06.882
- OH, HE WENT BACK
IN THE TUNNEL.

16:06.965 --> 16:08.384
- [sighs]
THANK GOODNESS.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.718
I WOULDN'T WANNA LOSE HIM
TWICE IN ONE DAY.

16:09.802 --> 16:10.886
- WHAT?

16:10.969 --> 16:13.013
- I'M GONNA HELP ALEC
WITH THAT GIFT.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.229
both: HEY.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.897
- HERE'S MY GIFT
FOR WILBUR.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.065
- WELL, IT'S
BEAUTIFULLY WRAPPED.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.858
- WELL, I ACTUALLY DID
SLAP A BOW ON IT,

16:24.942 --> 16:27.861
BUT IT LOOKED REALLY UNHAPPY
WEARING IT.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.571
- THIS IS REALLY SWEET
OF YOU,

16:29.655 --> 16:30.364
BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD
CLEAN IT FIRST.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.866
IT'S KIND OF DIRTY.
- WHAT? NO.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.619
NO, IT'S NOT DIRTY.
IT'S--IT'S BROKEN IN.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.454
SEE, YOU RUB IN OIL,

16:37.538 --> 16:39.081
AND, THEN, YOU TAKE A BALL,
AND YOU THROW IT IN THE POCKET,

16:39.164 --> 16:40.582
LIKE, A THOUSAND TIMES.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.667
AND, THEN, YOU LEAVE
THE BALL IN IT,

16:41.750 --> 16:43.627
YOU PUT IT UNDER YOUR PILLOW,
AND YOU SLEEP ON IT.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.920
- WOW.

16:45.003 --> 16:45.963
WERE YOU
A REALLY GOOD PLAYER?

16:46.046 --> 16:48.340
- ARE YOU GONNA CHECK?
- NO.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.510
- PSH, THEN I WAS GREAT.
- [chuckles]

16:51.593 --> 16:53.053
- AND YOU KEPT IT
ALL THESE YEARS.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.304
- YEAH, YEAH.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.764
WELL, MY DAD
GAVE IT TO ME,

16:55.848 --> 16:59.810
AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT SOMEDAY,
I'D GIVE IT TO MY...

16:59.893 --> 17:03.939
GIRLFRIEND'S FRIEND'S
GRANDSON.

17:04.021 --> 17:06.150
- OH, ALEC.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.569
YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.988
- HONEY, I AM GOOD
WITH OUR DECISION.

17:11.070 --> 17:13.741
- BUT WAS IT REALLY
OUR DECISION?

17:13.824 --> 17:16.160
- YEAH, OF COURSE
IT WAS.

17:16.242 --> 17:18.537
- SO YOU'RE 100% SURE

17:18.619 --> 17:21.582
THAT YOU DO NOT
WANT CHILDREN?

17:21.665 --> 17:25.294
THE TRUTH?

17:25.377 --> 17:26.753
- NO.

17:29.965 --> 17:32.301
[exhales]

17:34.928 --> 17:38.140
NO, I'M NOT 100% SURE.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.435
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I'M 50% SURE.

17:41.518 --> 17:44.980
BUT I AM VERY SURE
THAT I DON'T WANNA LOSE YOU.

17:45.063 --> 17:47.858
- I KNOW YOU FEEL THAT WAY
RIGHT NOW,

17:47.941 --> 17:51.195
BUT I ALSO KNOW
THAT EVERY TIME YOU SEE A FATHER

17:51.278 --> 17:53.781
PLAYING WITH HIS KID,

17:53.864 --> 17:57.076
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL A LITTLE SAD
THAT IT ISN'T YOU.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.160
- YEAH, THAT COULD HAPPEN.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.621
- IT WILL HAPPEN,

18:00.704 --> 18:02.331
AND I'M GONNA FEEL
LIKE I ROBBED YOU

18:02.414 --> 18:06.043
OF SOMETHING THAT I KNOW
IS WONDERFUL,

18:06.126 --> 18:08.128
SOMETHING THAT I'VE HAD,
BUT THAT YOU NEVER WILL.

18:08.212 --> 18:12.257
- BUT I LOVE YOU.
- AND I LOVE YOU TOO.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.011
THAT'S WHY...

18:16.095 --> 18:19.348
[sighs]

18:19.431 --> 18:22.851
THAT'S WHY I...

18:22.935 --> 18:26.188
WE...

18:29.399 --> 18:32.194
JUST GIVE THIS
TO YOUR SON.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.488
OR DAUGHTER.

18:34.571 --> 18:37.324
AND IF YOU'RE
EVER 100% SURE

18:37.407 --> 18:40.702
THAT YOU DON'T WANT THAT,
THEN FIND ME.

18:42.246 --> 18:45.916
- SO, WHAT?

18:45.999 --> 18:50.045
IS THIS GOOD-BYE?

18:50.128 --> 18:54.883
- YEAH, I GUESS IT IS.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.762
ALTHOUGH WE DO LIVE
AND WORK TOGETHER.

19:00.931 --> 19:05.102
- SO THIS IS GONNA BE SAD
<i>AND</i> AWKWARD?

19:05.185 --> 19:06.770
- HOW ABOUT WE JUST DEAL
WITH SAD TONIGHT

19:06.854 --> 19:11.316
AND AWKWARD TOMORROW?

19:11.400 --> 19:14.403
- OKAY.

19:20.784 --> 19:23.787
GOOD NIGHT, MELANIE.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.125
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DEAL

19:28.208 --> 19:30.252
WITH A LITTLE OF THE AWKWARD
RIGHT NOW.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.504
YOU HAVE THE KEYS.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.104
- [exhales]

19:51.815 --> 19:55.277
- [laughter from indoors]

19:55.360 --> 19:59.239
[excited chatter
from indoors]

19:59.323 --> 20:01.575
- [exhales]

20:09.875 --> 20:11.835
- HEY, JENNA!

20:11.919 --> 20:13.420
IT'S MOM.

20:13.503 --> 20:16.590
NO, NO,
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

20:16.673 --> 20:20.302
I JUST--JUST REALLY WANTED
TO TALK TO MY BABY.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.846
SO WHAT'S NEW?

20:22.930 --> 20:24.264
[gasps]
OH, WOW!

20:24.348 --> 20:26.642
YOU'RE KIDDING.

20:26.725 --> 20:27.935
THAT'S GREAT!

20:28.018 --> 20:29.311
IT'S JUST GREAT.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.980
NO, NO,
I GOT TIME.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.108
YEAH, I JUST
WANNA HEAR EVERYTHING.
