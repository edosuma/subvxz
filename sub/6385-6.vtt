WEBVTT

00:00.041 --> 00:01.958
Previously on Californication...

00:01.992 --> 00:02.992
Did you two come together?

00:03.043 --> 00:04.827
No! We just came in together.

00:07.781 --> 00:10.016
I've never stepped outside
of my marriage before.

00:10.050 --> 00:12.919
But I'm guessing that
you feel like you're...

00:12.953 --> 00:15.388
Owed one.

00:16.507 --> 00:17.974
Come on. You're coming in.

00:18.008 --> 00:19.392
I want to take a look at you.

00:21.628 --> 00:23.462
This is so not fair.

00:25.899 --> 00:28.318
Daisy... came to see me.

00:28.352 --> 00:30.236
What'd she say,
that little tramp?

00:30.270 --> 00:33.189
She said that she had
contracted a few stds.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.775
No, I seriously think I'm
gonna throw up right now.

00:35.809 --> 00:37.443
What could possibly be so awful

00:37.477 --> 00:38.661
about visiting the woman

00:38.696 --> 00:40.913
who pushed you through
her magnificent vagina?

00:40.948 --> 00:42.832
Chelsea has Lakers tickets.

00:42.866 --> 00:44.334
I'm so excited.

00:44.368 --> 00:46.586
I can't wait to squeeze
that little peanut.

00:46.620 --> 00:47.787
I wouldn't get too excited.

00:47.821 --> 00:49.372
She hasn't been very pleasant lately.

00:49.423 --> 00:51.591
Hey! Look who's here.

00:51.625 --> 00:53.459
Not even a hello.
Oh, good times.

00:53.493 --> 00:56.546
What? Were you just
gonna leave me behind?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:09.509 --> 01:11.343
My God.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.029
Chelsea. I need to take this.

01:13.063 --> 01:14.197
What... what do you mean?

01:14.231 --> 01:15.848
What, are you with the
organ transplant team?

01:15.866 --> 01:16.949
Shut that shit down.

01:16.984 --> 01:18.534
Tell your old man about your weekend.

01:18.569 --> 01:20.453
Start by telling me
how much you missed me.

01:20.487 --> 01:23.039
Oh, we had a grand old time.

01:23.073 --> 01:24.957
Soaked up some culture,
did you?

01:24.992 --> 01:27.210
Museums, shopping, girl talk?
Some dirty-water hot dogs maybe?

01:27.244 --> 01:28.211
What?

01:28.245 --> 01:29.712
Whoa. What? Where you going?

01:29.747 --> 01:31.714
I'm still allowed to pee,
aren't I?

01:37.537 --> 01:38.888
Remember this?

01:38.922 --> 01:40.890
- Remember when you thought...
- Yes.

01:40.924 --> 01:42.508
That was a good idea?
It's awful.

01:42.542 --> 01:44.811
I don't recognize her anymore.

01:44.845 --> 01:47.096
I told you.
She's changed, right?

01:47.147 --> 01:49.015
She's a miserable little
bitch all the time now.

01:49.049 --> 01:51.350
I guess at least we know why, right?

01:51.384 --> 01:53.603
- We do?
- Chelsea.

01:53.654 --> 01:55.154
It's all she cares about anymore.

01:55.189 --> 01:57.440
Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea.

01:57.491 --> 01:59.525
Well, i... it's better than
her caring about a boy, right?

01:59.559 --> 02:02.195
'Cause you can't get
pregnant from your bff.

02:02.229 --> 02:04.831
At least not without the
aid of a turkey baster.

02:04.865 --> 02:06.783
Oh, Hank,
this isn't working anymore.

02:06.834 --> 02:08.033
What isn't working?
Don't say that.

02:08.068 --> 02:09.252
This whole arrangement.

02:09.286 --> 02:12.205
She needs to be living
with me right now, okay?

02:12.239 --> 02:14.424
I know... I know she hates me.

02:14.458 --> 02:16.426
And I know she wants
to live here with you.

02:16.460 --> 02:18.761
But fuck it.
We're the parents, right?

02:18.796 --> 02:20.379
We get to decide.

02:20.413 --> 02:22.465
- We?
- Yes, we.

02:22.516 --> 02:24.750
So what, you're saying we
just pack up and leave L.A.?

02:24.768 --> 02:26.352
The three of us, move
back to New York together?

02:26.386 --> 02:28.054
Well, soon, yeah.

02:28.088 --> 02:30.389
End of the semester, whatever.

02:30.423 --> 02:32.442
This place is toxic.

02:32.476 --> 02:34.360
Okay?

02:34.394 --> 02:37.113
L.A. is no place to raise a daughter.

02:37.147 --> 02:38.698
- That's my line.
- I know.

02:38.732 --> 02:39.899
You're stealing my shit.

02:39.933 --> 02:42.401
All right.
To our beautiful family...

02:42.435 --> 02:44.370
I... yes.

02:44.404 --> 02:47.373
Our black President,
and my magnificent dong.

03:31.818 --> 03:33.119
What the fuck?

03:33.153 --> 03:35.505
I'm not even a part of
this fucking family anymore?

03:35.539 --> 03:36.672
Jesus Christ. Karen!

03:36.707 --> 03:38.541
She gets to decide?
How is that fair?

03:38.592 --> 03:40.259
I don't think we were shooting
for fair, honey. Karen!

03:40.294 --> 03:42.211
For the first time in my
life, I'm actually happy,

03:42.262 --> 03:43.596
and now you want me to pack up

03:43.630 --> 03:45.097
and move someplace I have no friends?

03:45.132 --> 03:46.549
New York doesn't mean shit to me.

03:46.600 --> 03:47.800
It isn't the answer to anything!

03:47.834 --> 03:49.001
Telling her together...

03:49.019 --> 03:50.770
I guess that didn't
work out so well, did it?

03:50.804 --> 03:52.271
Oh, well, you know
what? It kind of came up

03:52.306 --> 03:55.141
while the narcissist in the
family was deep-conditioning.

03:55.175 --> 03:57.443
I can't believe you didn't fight for me.

03:57.477 --> 03:59.362
There's nothing to fight about, honey.

03:59.396 --> 04:00.613
This was always the plan.

04:00.647 --> 04:02.865
Honey, you're gonna be
late to school, okay?

04:02.900 --> 04:04.951
We will talk about it later.

04:04.985 --> 04:07.119
I love you.

04:08.688 --> 04:11.657
So, well, the worst is over.

04:11.691 --> 04:12.792
Oh, yeah?

04:12.826 --> 04:14.243
You think the French revolution was over

04:14.294 --> 04:15.795
when they stormed the Bastille?

04:15.829 --> 04:17.747
No, no, no. They had a little
thing called the terror.

04:17.798 --> 04:18.748
It happened years later.

04:18.798 --> 04:20.466
She will get used to the idea.

04:20.500 --> 04:21.968
Who doesn't want to live in New York?

04:22.002 --> 04:24.554
- Mm.
- Anyway, professor...

04:24.588 --> 04:26.672
You need to get dressed.
You're gonna be late.

04:26.706 --> 04:28.925
Not that late. It's a
very progressive school.

04:28.976 --> 04:30.426
The students practically
teach themselves.

04:30.477 --> 04:31.677
- Uh-Uh, no,
stop. - Why?

04:31.711 --> 04:32.678
- Stop!
- Why?

04:32.712 --> 04:34.046
Because.

04:34.064 --> 04:36.015
Well, for a start, I don't
know where you've been.

04:36.049 --> 04:38.217
Well, I'm freshly showered, right?

04:38.235 --> 04:39.602
That should count for something.

04:39.653 --> 04:41.270
Besides, I don't know
where you've been either.

04:41.321 --> 04:43.272
- Oh, you do.
- Oh, I do?

04:43.323 --> 04:45.074
- Yeah.
- What is that, like a riddle?

04:45.108 --> 04:46.692
You getting all sphinx-like on me?

04:46.726 --> 04:50.112
- I slept with Bill.
- Ha ha-ha ha-ha.

04:50.163 --> 04:53.366
I slept with Bill.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.502
I ran into him at NYU
when he was visiting Mia.

04:56.536 --> 04:57.703
Ew! Ugh!

04:57.737 --> 04:59.622
She says hi, by the way.

04:59.673 --> 05:00.706
Um, are you okay?

05:00.740 --> 05:02.959
You look a little sick in your stomach.

05:03.010 --> 05:04.710
Oh...

05:04.744 --> 05:07.346
Shit, you're totally not
joking about this, are you?

05:07.381 --> 05:09.465
Oh...

05:09.516 --> 05:11.750
Hank.

05:11.768 --> 05:14.303
Oh, come on, honey.
It's not that big a deal.

05:14.354 --> 05:17.523
I mean, I kind of felt
like I owed him one.

05:17.557 --> 05:19.942
I did, you know,
ruin his life and all.

05:19.977 --> 05:22.061
I mean,
that night that I married him,

05:22.095 --> 05:24.697
and then I jumped in the car with you.

05:24.731 --> 05:27.950
God, it feels good to tell the truth.

05:31.238 --> 05:33.489
Come on, professor.

05:33.540 --> 05:35.458
Come out of there. Get dressed.

05:35.492 --> 05:38.160
I'm so excited to go to class with you!

05:42.549 --> 05:44.750
"Eva lifts her head from her book

05:44.784 --> 05:47.136
and regards the curious
figure striding her way.

05:47.170 --> 05:49.505
The faint hint of a
smile appears on her face.

05:49.556 --> 05:51.140
Adam slows down,
reaching her table.

05:51.174 --> 05:53.392
Their eyes meet, and it looks
like Adam is going to do it.

05:53.427 --> 05:54.760
But what do you know, folks?

05:54.794 --> 05:57.563
He averts his eyes and
keeps right on walking,

05:57.597 --> 05:59.565
jamming his hands in his pockets."

05:59.599 --> 06:03.686
Okay, so what can we learn
from this early execrable work

06:03.737 --> 06:06.522
from a major...
and I do mean major...

06:06.573 --> 06:07.523
American author?

06:07.574 --> 06:09.275
And don't be shy.

06:09.309 --> 06:11.277
Rip him a new asshole or three or four.

06:11.311 --> 06:14.246
Go. Dig in.

06:15.482 --> 06:16.648
Sir?

06:20.287 --> 06:22.254
Sir?

06:22.289 --> 06:24.540
Yes.

06:24.591 --> 06:27.093
I think "execrable" is a little harsh.

06:27.127 --> 06:29.295
I mean,
I didn't think it was so bad.

06:29.329 --> 06:31.714
And I think those that
are auditing this class

06:31.765 --> 06:32.882
really shouldn't participate.

06:32.933 --> 06:34.133
Others?

06:34.167 --> 06:35.801
Uh, I think you should
let the woman speak.

06:35.835 --> 06:37.970
Sorry, what did you
say your name was again?

06:38.004 --> 06:40.806
She didn't. Next.

06:40.840 --> 06:41.891
Well...

06:41.942 --> 06:43.509
"Their eyes meet"?

06:43.527 --> 06:45.111
That's a little hokey,
don't you think?

06:45.145 --> 06:46.862
And, uh...

06:46.897 --> 06:50.032
Eva's whole introduction,
really, is just...

06:50.067 --> 06:51.567
Stupid, you know?

06:51.618 --> 06:52.902
We know she's pretty.

06:52.953 --> 06:53.953
- We get it.
- And we're out of time.

06:53.987 --> 06:56.155
Look at that.
Class has now ended.

06:56.189 --> 06:59.458
Go in peace and love to serve the word.

07:06.083 --> 07:07.550
Well...

07:07.584 --> 07:10.970
Um, here's the papers
on last week's poetry

07:11.004 --> 07:13.389
of Jagger and Richards.

07:13.423 --> 07:14.640
Thank you.

07:14.674 --> 07:17.426
Jill.

07:17.477 --> 07:19.395
Thanks.

07:22.516 --> 07:25.184
Well, then,
I'll see you next week.

07:25.218 --> 07:27.019
Thanks, Jill.

07:30.056 --> 07:32.742
You are unbelievable.

07:32.776 --> 07:33.943
What?

07:33.994 --> 07:35.911
So, Adam...

07:35.946 --> 07:37.613
which one are you sleeping with?

07:37.664 --> 07:38.897
- Excuse me?

07:38.915 --> 07:42.535
My bets are on the
young, voluptuous student.

07:42.569 --> 07:44.336
She's a definite...

07:44.371 --> 07:46.288
Eva prototype.

07:46.339 --> 07:47.840
Please. There's only one Eva.

07:47.874 --> 07:50.259
Besides, it's against the
rules to sleep with students.

07:50.293 --> 07:53.262
Oh, of course. Yes.

07:53.296 --> 07:54.880
Though when I was in college...

07:54.914 --> 07:56.132
- Oh, Jesus.
- I slept with...

07:56.183 --> 07:57.433
"Slept with my professor."
I know!

07:57.467 --> 07:58.801
I've heard quite enough

07:58.852 --> 08:00.853
about your sexual
goings-on for one day.

08:00.887 --> 08:03.439
I can't believe you kept
this ridiculous story.

08:03.473 --> 08:05.691
I mean, you wrote this
when you were, like, 23?

08:05.725 --> 08:08.360
I save everything I write...
all parts of the buffalo.

08:08.395 --> 08:09.361
Hmm.

08:09.396 --> 08:11.313
Especially the stuff about you.

08:11.364 --> 08:14.733
Yeah, one-act plays, haikus,

08:14.767 --> 08:17.069
grocery lists.

08:17.103 --> 08:19.288
Hank. Oh, Hank.

08:19.322 --> 08:20.739
I'm sorry, I was just wondering

08:20.773 --> 08:22.041
if you were picking up...

08:22.075 --> 08:24.493
- Felicia.
- The girls from school today.

08:24.544 --> 08:26.829
K... Karen. Karen.
- Hey.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.247
Felicia.

08:28.281 --> 08:30.716
Karen. Not... not the Karen?

08:30.750 --> 08:32.585
The mamacita of my bambina.

08:32.619 --> 08:35.120
Si.
- Hey. I'm Becca's mom.

08:35.138 --> 08:36.755
It's nice to meet you.

08:36.789 --> 08:38.256
- I'm Chelsea's mum.
- Oh, yeah.

08:38.291 --> 08:40.476
Lovely to meet you finally.

08:40.510 --> 08:42.977
Becca must be delighted
to have you back.

08:43.013 --> 08:44.480
- Well, she's not back back.
- Well, no.

08:44.514 --> 08:46.015
It's just a quick visit.

08:46.066 --> 08:48.184
You know, my work keeps
me in New York, so...

08:48.235 --> 08:49.652
I know. It's so awful,
isn't it?

08:49.686 --> 08:51.987
The whole working-mum thing.

08:52.022 --> 08:54.857
I'm so lucky with my teaching schedule.

08:54.908 --> 08:57.743
Actually, I'm not
working this afternoon,

08:57.777 --> 08:59.111
so I could pick them up if you'd like.

08:59.145 --> 09:01.413
Oh, no, you know what?
That's okay.

09:01.448 --> 09:03.332
I kind of... I kind of like
it. I miss it, actually.

09:03.366 --> 09:06.836
Oh, yeah, well, who... who
doesn't love a carpool line?

09:06.870 --> 09:09.288
Well, then,
problem solved, I guess.

09:09.322 --> 09:12.341
- So, lovely to meet you.
- Yeah.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.093
And you. Yes. Yeah, bye.

09:16.346 --> 09:19.548
Oh, my God,
can you believe that woman?

09:19.599 --> 09:21.684
Yeah, she's... she's
real classy-like, right?

09:21.718 --> 09:23.602
What?

09:23.637 --> 09:25.221
No, and that ridiculous accent.

09:25.272 --> 09:26.722
I mean, what the fuck?

09:26.773 --> 09:28.107
- It's pleasant.
- She was like, you know,

09:28.141 --> 09:29.675
"So lovely to meet you.

09:29.693 --> 09:31.026
My... my schedule."

09:31.061 --> 09:32.695
But that... it's... she
taught to speak like that.

09:32.729 --> 09:35.364
She's not making it...
I think you're jealous.

09:35.398 --> 09:36.815
Are you being jealous?

09:36.849 --> 09:38.617
No.

09:38.652 --> 09:39.985
If I didn't know any
better, I'd say you were.

09:40.019 --> 09:43.405
I mean, no, she is
definitely not your type.

09:46.326 --> 09:47.993
No.

09:49.913 --> 09:51.213
There you are,

09:51.248 --> 09:53.999
you V.D.-riddled sack of shit.

09:54.033 --> 09:57.136
Ten days' worth of
antibiotics I have to take,

09:57.170 --> 09:59.054
just in case, mind you.

09:59.089 --> 10:00.506
I'm taking them too, you know,

10:00.540 --> 10:01.974
and I'm getting tested tomorrow.

10:02.008 --> 10:05.311
Yes, dear, but the delicate
balance of yeast in your vagina

10:05.345 --> 10:07.479
isn't as likely to be compromised

10:07.514 --> 10:09.348
by all this shit, now, is it?

10:09.382 --> 10:10.599
Just, you know,
eat more yogurt.

10:10.650 --> 10:13.519
Hey, I'll make you a smoothy.

10:13.553 --> 10:16.655
Do I look like I want a fucking smoothy?

10:16.690 --> 10:19.275
Whose Corvette is that
blocking the driveway?

10:19.326 --> 10:20.576
Rick Springfield.

10:20.610 --> 10:22.611
And a smoothy can be very
refreshing on a hot day.

10:22.662 --> 10:24.496
Oh, now you got to be fucking with me.

10:24.531 --> 10:25.897
What fucking with you?

10:25.916 --> 10:29.168
I said, whose car is that
blocking the driveway?

10:29.202 --> 10:30.586
And I said Rick Springfield.

10:30.620 --> 10:31.954
He's got a big audition tomorrow,

10:32.005 --> 10:33.238
and we're running lines here.

10:33.256 --> 10:34.340
Shut the fuck up.

10:34.374 --> 10:36.241
Rick Springfield is
running lines with you

10:36.259 --> 10:37.743
in my house right now?

10:37.761 --> 10:39.595
Yes, he's a new client.
I've told you this before.

10:39.629 --> 10:40.930
Now, listen to me.

10:40.964 --> 10:43.015
I'm gonna be late coming
back from his audition,

10:43.049 --> 10:45.250
so I got everything prepped for
our dinner with Hank and Karen.

10:45.268 --> 10:47.303
It's gonna be gumbo.

10:47.354 --> 10:49.271
Everything's going in
the pressure cooker.

10:49.306 --> 10:52.758
All you have to do is remember
to start the rice, please.

10:52.776 --> 10:56.779
Rick fucking Springfield
is here in my house

10:56.813 --> 10:58.597
right fucking now?

10:58.615 --> 11:00.449
Yes!

11:00.483 --> 11:03.736
He's upstairs having a nap,
sort of.

11:03.770 --> 11:05.154
- Hey, Runkle.
- Or wait.

11:05.205 --> 11:08.207
I spoke too soon.
Here's Rick now.

11:08.241 --> 11:09.875
Dude, don't you have anything raunchier

11:09.909 --> 11:12.828
than back issues of gent magazine?

11:12.879 --> 11:14.964
Well...

11:14.998 --> 11:16.465
Hello.

11:16.499 --> 11:18.450
Oh, my God.

11:18.468 --> 11:19.618
You're really...

11:19.636 --> 11:22.504
Rick Springfield in my house right now.

11:22.555 --> 11:23.806
Um...

11:23.840 --> 11:26.308
you're... you're very tall and...

11:26.343 --> 11:30.179
and dark and handsome and, uh...

11:30.230 --> 11:32.231
No. Charlie doesn't have
anything raunchier than that,

11:32.265 --> 11:33.732
because he likes to, you know,

11:33.767 --> 11:35.567
kick it old school with the pornography.

11:35.602 --> 11:37.903
- Know what I'm saying?
- Church.

11:37.937 --> 11:39.688
Hey, are these my beta-blockers?

11:39.739 --> 11:42.858
- I get real nervous before...
- Oh, no, that's just a...

11:42.909 --> 11:44.309
- Lip gloss.
- Oh.

11:44.327 --> 11:47.196
Back in the old days,
sue used to blow me.

11:47.247 --> 11:50.249
But these days, she
likes them younger...

11:50.283 --> 11:52.001
and balder.

11:52.035 --> 11:54.703
- Hey... would you...
- Okay. Okay!

11:54.754 --> 11:56.088
Don't you need to be
running along somewhere,

11:56.122 --> 11:57.206
little one, hmm?

11:57.257 --> 11:59.591
- Appointments and such?
- No, I'm okay.

11:59.626 --> 12:01.677
I just want to stay here
and talk to Rick Springfield.

12:01.711 --> 12:04.013
Not on my watch, okay?
We got work to do.

12:04.047 --> 12:05.848
Lots of it.
No time for distractions.

12:05.882 --> 12:07.933
- But come on!
- One more word out of you,

12:07.967 --> 12:09.501
and I'm gonna tell him what
those pills are really for.

12:09.519 --> 12:10.552
Shh!

12:15.642 --> 12:17.359
When I was a kid, you spoke
when you were spoken to,

12:17.394 --> 12:19.111
or else you were chased around a kitchen

12:19.145 --> 12:20.612
with a wooden spoon.

12:20.647 --> 12:23.232
Sorry, we weren't put on
this planet to entertain you.

12:23.283 --> 12:25.617
Untrue... entertainment for the poor.

12:25.652 --> 12:27.202
That's what my mother
always called children.

12:27.237 --> 12:29.238
Clearly, she was wrong.

12:29.289 --> 12:32.408
Hmm.
Well, maybe if you weren't poor...

12:32.459 --> 12:34.043
- Excuse me?
- Poor? Are we?

12:34.077 --> 12:35.411
I didn't get that memo.
Are we poor?

12:35.462 --> 12:37.746
No offense, Karen, but
Becca showed me a picture

12:37.797 --> 12:39.415
of the apartment where you live,

12:39.466 --> 12:41.583
and I've been in dorm rooms
that are bigger than that.

12:41.634 --> 12:43.502
I mean, I think that it
would be best for Becca

12:43.536 --> 12:44.720
if she could stay in L.A.

12:44.754 --> 12:48.340
and have at least some
shot at a normal life.

12:56.649 --> 12:58.734
- She did say "no offense."
- Okay.

13:01.154 --> 13:02.104
Ooh! She returns!

13:04.074 --> 13:05.223
Yes!

13:05.241 --> 13:07.693
Yes, in! On the fucking line!

13:07.727 --> 13:09.578
I'm gonna take you down, mommy.

13:09.612 --> 13:10.746
Oh, Jesus.

13:10.780 --> 13:12.564
Is there any sport for which your father

13:12.582 --> 13:15.167
does not have the proper attire?

13:15.201 --> 13:17.169
I bet he swims in a speedo.
Does he?

13:18.254 --> 13:19.922
- Oh!
- Yes!

13:19.956 --> 13:23.258
Yes! Yes! Take that,
you lazy motherfucker!

13:23.293 --> 13:24.409
Oh, hello.

13:24.427 --> 13:26.011
- Felicia.
- All right...

13:26.045 --> 13:28.079
You just caught us
getting some exercise.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.515
Hello.

13:29.549 --> 13:32.417
- Honey, game's not over.
- That was just a point?

13:32.435 --> 13:34.103
What do you do when
you win a whole match,

13:34.137 --> 13:35.420
sacrifice a calf?

13:35.438 --> 13:36.805
- He doesn't...
- Cheers.

13:36.856 --> 13:39.775
Actually mean it, all that
trash talking and such.

13:39.809 --> 13:43.312
That's just his way.
Stacy, this is Becca's mum.

13:43.363 --> 13:44.613
- Karen!
- Hi.

13:44.647 --> 13:46.865
Oh, so nice to meet you.
Heard so much about you.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.367
- Oh!
- Delighted.

13:48.401 --> 13:50.319
- Thank you.
- You should stay for dinner.

13:50.370 --> 13:52.037
Just you, not him.

13:52.071 --> 13:53.455
Okay, give me that racket.

13:53.490 --> 13:54.656
The dean has just requested

13:54.707 --> 13:57.042
a heaping helping of
my backhand for dinner.

13:57.076 --> 13:59.611
- Yes, of course, you must stay.
- Oh, well, you know,

13:59.629 --> 14:01.380
That's really kind,
but we have plans.

14:01.414 --> 14:03.665
We're meeting some friends, so...

14:03.716 --> 14:05.884
Their friends, not mine.

14:05.919 --> 14:08.670
Yes. But the point is
we're going as a family.

14:08.721 --> 14:11.140
Tout ensemble...
so that's the point.

14:11.174 --> 14:13.809
And I'd rather stay
here with this family.

14:13.843 --> 14:15.894
Oh, isn't she sweet?

14:15.929 --> 14:17.896
You know you're always
welcome here, Becca.

14:17.931 --> 14:19.314
Yes. Always.

14:19.349 --> 14:21.800
Your... your mom is
visiting from New York.

14:21.818 --> 14:23.318
Your mom...
have you met your mom?

14:23.353 --> 14:24.803
She's only gonna be
here for a little while.

14:24.821 --> 14:26.304
You want to spend time with her, no?

14:26.322 --> 14:27.406
No.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.857
Once you drag me back to New York,

14:28.908 --> 14:32.077
All I'm going to be doing is
spending time with my mother.

14:32.111 --> 14:34.329
I certainly won't have any friends.

14:34.364 --> 14:35.914
All right, Becca,
apologize to your mother.

14:35.949 --> 14:38.033
It's fine. It's really fine.

14:38.084 --> 14:39.985
You know what?
It seems like you have

14:40.003 --> 14:41.703
An open invitation here,
so it's...

14:41.754 --> 14:42.955
Of course!

14:42.989 --> 14:44.706
It's no problem if you
want to stay for dinner.

14:44.757 --> 14:46.842
And that way, you two can have
a lovely time with your friends.

14:46.876 --> 14:49.327
Yes. Thank you, Felicia.

14:55.969 --> 14:58.770
Karen couldn't make it.

14:58.805 --> 14:59.938
Not feeling well.

14:59.973 --> 15:01.440
Mm-Hmm.

15:01.474 --> 15:02.724
Yes!

15:02.775 --> 15:04.393
Oh, God!

15:04.444 --> 15:06.278
- Oh, look at you.
- Look at you.

15:06.312 --> 15:08.346
- I miss you.
- Is this for me?

15:08.364 --> 15:09.681
What, my muumuu?

15:09.699 --> 15:11.033
You look like America's next top smurf.

15:11.067 --> 15:13.368
It's just the schmata I
wear around the house. What?

15:13.403 --> 15:16.288
- In with you! -
Where's the Runkle-Ator?

15:16.322 --> 15:17.706
- Well, he's stuck in...
- Runkle!

15:17.740 --> 15:20.125
Traffic on his way over from the valley.

15:20.159 --> 15:21.860
That man is dead to me,
by the way.

15:21.878 --> 15:23.078
Do you see this?

15:23.129 --> 15:26.197
This hideous VD-type
pustule on my face?

15:26.216 --> 15:27.916
- Ooh!
- No, not really.

15:27.967 --> 15:29.218
- That is disgusting.
- Yeah.

15:29.252 --> 15:30.469
- Shut up.
- You see it, right?

15:30.503 --> 15:32.137
- Oh, yeah, it's deep in there.
- Guess what?

15:32.171 --> 15:33.889
He gave it to me. Thanks.

15:33.923 --> 15:36.391
And he tried to rape me,
by the way.

15:36.426 --> 15:37.726
But how are you?

15:37.760 --> 15:40.812
I'm good. I... I... you
know, Becca, she's...

15:40.847 --> 15:42.064
- Hello.
- I know.

15:42.098 --> 15:44.049
Hello.
Make way for the victors.

15:44.067 --> 15:46.268
- Victory.
- He got the part?

15:46.319 --> 15:49.488
You got the part? Oh, my God!

15:49.522 --> 15:51.389
Congratulations...

15:51.407 --> 15:54.243
- Is that Rick Springfield?
- I believe it is, yeah.

15:54.277 --> 15:58.614
And who are you, pretty lady?

16:03.169 --> 16:05.570
Rick Springfield and
Andy Gibb on solid gold...

16:05.588 --> 16:07.256
This means nothing to you?

16:07.290 --> 16:08.340
I remember.

16:08.374 --> 16:10.626
Everybody loved Rick Springfield, right?

16:10.677 --> 16:12.344
She just didn't have
the poster over her bed.

16:12.378 --> 16:16.014
You... I'm guessing you practiced
your she-bopping to that, huh?

16:16.049 --> 16:17.849
You know what always
used to start my motor?

16:17.884 --> 16:19.017
Mannix.

16:19.052 --> 16:20.752
That tall Armenian

16:20.770 --> 16:22.688
with a great head of hair... mmm.

16:22.722 --> 16:26.775
Just thinking of him still
gets my juices flowing.

16:28.111 --> 16:30.279
Teen fantasies are great, okay?

16:30.313 --> 16:32.197
You know,
I've had some of my own.

16:32.231 --> 16:34.149
Oh, yeah, what, you?
Duran Duran?

16:34.200 --> 16:36.768
- Ha.
- Boy George?

16:36.786 --> 16:38.287
Cheryl Tiegs,
thank you very much.

16:38.321 --> 16:40.772
My point is,
you have to remember...

16:40.790 --> 16:42.374
musicians, actors, models...

16:42.408 --> 16:44.660
these are people with flaws and such.

16:44.711 --> 16:47.162
I mean, there's no way
they could possibly live up

16:47.213 --> 16:49.280
to the excitement, the mystery

16:49.299 --> 16:51.616
that our tortured teen psyches
choose to project upon them.

16:51.634 --> 16:54.119
- That... that's my point.
- Oh, my God.

16:54.137 --> 16:55.554
I made a girl come seven times once.

16:57.173 --> 16:58.390
Oh...

16:58.424 --> 17:01.343
Over the course of an
entire relationship?

17:02.595 --> 17:04.813
All in a row?

17:04.847 --> 17:06.848
Sweet Jesus.

17:06.898 --> 17:09.351
Who's ready for dessert?
I know I am.

17:09.402 --> 17:10.969
Cheers to you,
Rick Springfield.

17:10.987 --> 17:12.154
Hold on a second.

17:20.163 --> 17:21.863
What are you doing moping in the fridge?

17:21.914 --> 17:24.983
'80s pop legend Rick Springfield
is in there stealing your girl,

17:25.001 --> 17:26.585
not Jessie's girl, your girl,

17:26.618 --> 17:28.820
- Runkle's girl.
- I'm well aware of this fact.

17:28.838 --> 17:30.339
So get in thereand make her jealous.

17:30.373 --> 17:32.374
With what?
You gonna loan me Karen?

17:32.425 --> 17:33.875
That's disgusting.
What's wrong with you?

17:33.926 --> 17:35.460
- What's wrong with you?
- Fuck you.

17:36.495 --> 17:37.929
Yello.

17:37.964 --> 17:39.214
Shit, really?

17:39.265 --> 17:42.050
Um... all right, w... w... we'll...

17:42.101 --> 17:43.301
Yeah. We'll be right over.

17:43.335 --> 17:44.386
- We got to go.
- What?

17:44.437 --> 17:45.503
Little problem with the offspring.

17:45.521 --> 17:46.888
Don't panic, no, no, no.

17:46.939 --> 17:48.690
They just...
it seems Becca and Chelsea

17:48.725 --> 17:50.675
staged a raid on the Dean's wine cellar.

17:50.693 --> 17:53.895
Oh, my God. I knew that
Chelsea was trouble.

17:53.946 --> 17:55.447
Oh... honey, I...

17:55.481 --> 17:57.449
- Okay. Call me later.
- Very nice to meet you.

17:57.483 --> 17:59.901
- I hope she's okay.
- Bye, Rick Springfield.

17:59.952 --> 18:02.454
Bye, guys.

18:02.488 --> 18:04.856
Mm. Do you want to, um...

18:04.874 --> 18:07.743
go up to my room and
listen to some records?

18:09.912 --> 18:12.547
- Only if they're mine.
- Church.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.754
So, Runkle,

18:18.805 --> 18:21.723
what are you serving for dessert?

18:21.758 --> 18:23.708
I know what I want.

18:23.726 --> 18:26.728
Tube steak. Yes, I know.

18:26.763 --> 18:29.264
Listen, Sue, this is, uh...

18:29.315 --> 18:32.434
a really difficult
time for me right now,

18:32.485 --> 18:34.886
and besides, I should
probably let you know

18:34.904 --> 18:36.321
I think I have V.D.

18:36.355 --> 18:37.739
Oh, no worries.

18:37.774 --> 18:41.576
Oh, just slap a bag on
it, and I'm good to go.

18:44.914 --> 18:46.564
Welcome.

18:46.582 --> 18:48.784
Glass of Cab?

18:48.835 --> 18:51.620
Oh, fuck, I forget what
fucking year this is.

18:51.671 --> 18:52.621
Stacy!

18:52.672 --> 18:54.005
- She's drunk.
- No.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.740
Look, she can't even
walk in a straight line.

18:55.758 --> 18:57.793
Felicia, are you drunk?

18:57.844 --> 18:59.077
Just a tiny bit.

18:59.095 --> 19:00.545
Seems such a shame

19:00.579 --> 19:02.747
to let all that perfectly
good wine go to waste.

19:02.765 --> 19:04.599
They opened about $3,000 worth.

19:04.634 --> 19:06.251
Which is the one you were saving

19:06.269 --> 19:08.019
for our 20th anniversary?

19:08.054 --> 19:10.555
Not that we're ever gonna
get there, at this point.

19:10.589 --> 19:12.641
Oh, darling, I think you
should slow down a little bit.

19:12.692 --> 19:14.693
Karen, may I get you a glass?

19:14.727 --> 19:18.363
I've got an '82 Petrus,
an '86 Chateau Margaux,

19:18.397 --> 19:20.982
and a '92 screaming eagle
Cab that'll blow your mind.

19:21.033 --> 19:22.367
What can I get you?

19:22.401 --> 19:25.454
This is not some
fucking social occasion!

19:25.488 --> 19:27.605
I have come here to collect my daughter!

19:27.623 --> 19:28.990
Okay, so where is she?

19:29.041 --> 19:30.208
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Becca!

19:30.243 --> 19:31.776
I understand your concern, but...

19:31.794 --> 19:33.328
- Becca!
- Is profanity really warranted?

19:33.379 --> 19:35.580
- Where the fuck is she?
- It's a big house.

19:35.614 --> 19:37.282
They keep the kids
chained in the basement.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.050
She's not as scary as she seems.

19:39.085 --> 19:41.119
She has some anger-management issues.

19:41.137 --> 19:42.287
- Thank you.
- Excellent.

19:42.305 --> 19:43.788
A whole family of sociopaths.

19:43.806 --> 19:45.674
Okay, in this case,
maybe she's right.

19:45.725 --> 19:47.458
We should just get Becca and leave.

19:47.477 --> 19:49.060
- Yes!
- Oh, whatever you like.

19:49.095 --> 19:51.629
I... I don't see why we can't
all just sit down as adults

19:51.647 --> 19:53.315
and talk this thing through.

19:53.349 --> 19:54.799
What?
Your idea of shitty parenting?

19:54.817 --> 19:56.651
Uh-Oh.

19:56.686 --> 19:58.520
Oh, well, I don't think
that's our place to comment,

19:58.571 --> 19:59.905
even though you're absolutely right.

19:59.939 --> 20:02.807
Let's all just try to
keep cool heads, shall we?

20:02.825 --> 20:04.743
The girls are just
testing our boundaries.

20:04.777 --> 20:06.828
It's all perfectly normal
for their age range.

20:06.863 --> 20:08.864
Normal for Chelsea, maybe.

20:08.915 --> 20:11.249
Are you implying that this
is all Chelsea's fault?

20:11.284 --> 20:12.817
Oh, no,
I'm not implying anything.

20:12.835 --> 20:15.153
- I'm just saying it flat out.
- Oh, you've got a lot of nerve.

20:15.171 --> 20:17.038
Oh, shit,
now you've angered the Dean.

20:17.089 --> 20:19.207
- Becca! Becca!
- Hank, find her.

20:19.258 --> 20:21.376
Fuck it, Stacy. She's right.

20:21.427 --> 20:23.328
This is obviously Chelsea's fault.

20:23.346 --> 20:24.796
Becca doesn't have the gumption

20:24.830 --> 20:26.548
to get in any kind of serious trouble.

20:26.599 --> 20:28.099
- She's a follower.
- Excuse me?

20:28.134 --> 20:29.885
Oh, no, no, no. I
meant it in a nice way.

20:29.936 --> 20:31.669
You know, teenagers suck.

20:31.687 --> 20:34.105
They're all bloody awful,
Chelsea in particular.

20:34.140 --> 20:36.507
I just hope she makes it to
17 without getting pregnant.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.609
Honey!

20:37.643 --> 20:39.510
That's not fair.

20:39.529 --> 20:42.564
You're all such fucking hypocrites.

20:42.615 --> 20:45.951
We are the way we are

20:45.985 --> 20:48.537
because you made us this way.

20:48.571 --> 20:51.022
Okay, sweetie,
come on. Let's go home.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.241
- I don't want to go home.
- Hank!

20:53.292 --> 20:55.994
I want you all to listen to me for once!

20:56.028 --> 20:57.963
Sweetie, we're here.

20:57.997 --> 20:59.548
All right? We're listening.

20:59.582 --> 21:01.366
We're all ears.

21:01.384 --> 21:03.468
What is it you want to say?

21:03.502 --> 21:05.554
What is it... oh, boy.

21:05.588 --> 21:06.555
Oh!

21:19.235 --> 21:21.219
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

21:24.323 --> 21:26.691
Oh, I fucking love this part!

21:26.725 --> 21:31.446
Me too, me too,
me too! Ah ah ah ah ah!

21:31.497 --> 21:33.949
Hi.
What took you so long, Runkle?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.734
You know, they've been at
it for a while over there.

21:36.752 --> 21:38.086
Sounds good too.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.505
I almost started without you.

21:40.539 --> 21:44.242
I'm just finishing up some dishes.

21:45.544 --> 21:47.429
I thought I'd let a few things soak.

21:47.463 --> 21:49.014
Runkle, are you...

21:49.048 --> 21:50.265
were you crying?

21:50.299 --> 21:52.267
Ah...

21:52.301 --> 21:54.853
Maybe, a little.

21:54.887 --> 21:56.087
Yes.

21:56.105 --> 21:57.639
Oh, please!

21:57.690 --> 21:59.057
Over that?

21:59.091 --> 22:01.309
That's kids' stuff.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.928
- Ignore it.
- Destroy me, Rick Springfield!

22:03.946 --> 22:06.231
Listen to that, will you?

22:06.265 --> 22:08.700
I don't know how to compete with that!

22:08.734 --> 22:10.935
The only time I ever made
Marcy squeal like that

22:10.953 --> 22:12.704
was when I put the ring on her finger!

22:12.738 --> 22:14.105
Harry Winston?

22:14.123 --> 22:15.940
Tiffany.

22:15.958 --> 22:17.942
Oh, Runkle.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.879
You are the saddest
sack I have ever seen!

22:20.913 --> 22:24.249
To you, the glass is
always half empty, huh?

22:24.283 --> 22:25.717
Never half full?

22:25.751 --> 22:29.137
Right now my wife is half
full of Rick Springfield!

22:29.171 --> 22:30.755
That's exactly what I mean.

22:30.789 --> 22:31.890
Men.

22:31.924 --> 22:33.725
I mean, you are the
biggest bunch of pussies

22:33.759 --> 22:34.976
there ever was.

22:35.011 --> 22:37.628
Yes, yes, yes!

22:37.647 --> 22:39.130
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

22:39.148 --> 22:41.066
Well, I'm gonna let you
off the hook this time.

22:41.100 --> 22:43.568
But before I go...

22:43.602 --> 22:44.969
I'm gonna give you a little tip

22:44.987 --> 22:47.989
on how to get your
hot little wifey back.

22:48.024 --> 22:53.028
Sex is supposed to be about joy, Runkle,

22:53.079 --> 22:55.497
pure joy.

22:57.199 --> 22:59.918
And if you've forgotten
what that sounds like...

22:59.952 --> 23:01.753
Ah!

23:01.787 --> 23:02.987
Oh!

23:03.005 --> 23:05.674
Oh! Don't stop!

23:05.708 --> 23:08.009
Runkle, no! Don't...

23:08.044 --> 23:09.177
Stop!

23:09.211 --> 23:10.845
Oh, God!

23:10.880 --> 23:12.330
You are good!

23:12.348 --> 23:14.349
Oh, oh, oh!

23:14.383 --> 23:17.936
Ah! That is perfect!

23:17.970 --> 23:18.970
Ah!

23:19.004 --> 23:20.722
Oh, that's... oh... oh...

23:20.773 --> 23:23.508
That is perfect!

23:28.013 --> 23:30.732
Ahh!

23:35.821 --> 23:38.623
Collini... out.

23:44.046 --> 23:46.414
Come on, take this.

23:46.465 --> 23:49.300
Now, you may wake up in
the middle of the night...

23:49.335 --> 23:51.202
possibly craving an egg mcmuffin.

23:51.220 --> 23:53.555
The important thing is not to
get off the ride at that point,

23:53.589 --> 23:54.923
but to remain in your seat

23:54.974 --> 23:58.393
with your seatbelt securely fastened.

23:58.427 --> 24:00.895
Okay, sweetie?

24:00.930 --> 24:03.214
Good night, sweetie.

24:03.232 --> 24:06.484
I promise, everything
will be better tomorrow.

24:06.519 --> 24:08.770
Except for your head.
That'll feel much worse.

24:08.821 --> 24:11.523
Stay.

24:18.447 --> 24:20.615
What's up, sweetie?

24:20.666 --> 24:23.451
We don't have to do
what she says, you know.

24:23.502 --> 24:26.421
- What who says?
- Her.

24:26.455 --> 24:28.757
The enemy.

24:28.791 --> 24:30.675
Your mom is not the enemy.

24:30.709 --> 24:32.910
She loves you. She wants
what's best for you.

24:32.928 --> 24:35.296
Mom doesn't understand.
She never will.

24:35.347 --> 24:38.016
This is it, okay?

24:38.050 --> 24:40.751
I'm not just gonna wake up
one day and be like her...

24:40.770 --> 24:43.354
six feet tall and beautiful.

24:44.857 --> 24:47.592
You already are beautiful.

24:47.610 --> 24:51.112
Chelsea's the only friend I've ever had,

24:51.147 --> 24:53.931
the only one who accepts
me for who I really am.

24:53.949 --> 24:56.484
- That is not true.
- It is.

24:56.535 --> 24:58.787
Do you know what it's like

24:58.821 --> 25:01.606
to have no one and nothing,

25:01.624 --> 25:04.292
how totally awful that feels?

25:06.612 --> 25:08.946
Yes, I think I do. I...

25:08.964 --> 25:13.218
once upon a time,
I felt like that.

25:13.252 --> 25:15.003
Now I have you.

25:18.007 --> 25:20.475
Yet, somehow...

25:20.509 --> 25:22.844
I still have nothing.

25:33.805 --> 25:34.823
Good night.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.292
Thanks.

25:56.462 --> 25:58.546
So...

25:58.597 --> 26:00.715
I guess you're on her side,

26:00.766 --> 26:03.000
like you guys are this team right now.

26:03.018 --> 26:05.503
We're a team, all right.

26:07.389 --> 26:10.692
Just not a very good one,

26:10.726 --> 26:12.694
not without our captain.

26:12.728 --> 26:14.229
You know, you're right.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.347
L.A. is no place to raise a daughter

26:16.365 --> 26:18.483
or a dad.

26:18.517 --> 26:20.702
We need your guidance.

26:20.736 --> 26:22.687
We need you, mommy dearest...

26:24.406 --> 26:27.709
Really...

26:27.743 --> 26:30.745
Even though sometimes we
may take you for granted

26:30.796 --> 26:33.464
and throw embarrassing
hissy fits and get drunk

26:33.499 --> 26:36.968
and generally act like we don't
give a shit about anything.

26:38.470 --> 26:39.804
So you're just both

26:39.838 --> 26:42.090
adolescent girls at heart, right?

26:42.141 --> 26:46.060
Yes, we are, the both of us.

26:47.763 --> 26:50.348
I like you like this.

26:50.382 --> 26:52.717
What, all defeated and shit?

26:52.735 --> 26:54.051
Yes.

26:54.069 --> 26:57.221
You're like... you're
like putty in my hands.

26:57.239 --> 26:59.107
- Oh, yeah?
- Really.

26:59.158 --> 27:01.892
- Do with me what you will.
- Mm.

27:05.063 --> 27:08.750
- Anything?
- Yeah, anything at all.

27:16.342 --> 27:18.459
Mm. Hank?

27:18.510 --> 27:19.627
Wha...

27:19.678 --> 27:22.580
You know what I said
about Bill this morning?

27:22.598 --> 27:23.914
Yes.

27:23.933 --> 27:25.516
Got ya.

27:29.421 --> 27:31.356
You fucker.
