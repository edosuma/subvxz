02:12.957 --> 02:14.156
State your mission.

02:14.191 --> 02:16.394
Team 1, Blue House
main building!

02:16.429 --> 02:18.027
Team 2, guard room!

02:18.062 --> 02:19.897
Team 3, secretary's office!

02:19.932 --> 02:21.697
Team 4, take out guards,

02:21.632 --> 02:24.396
<i>Seoul, night landscape
and capture vehicles.</i>

02:24.669 --> 02:26.602
For the South's liberation,

02:26.637 --> 02:30.207
our unit 124 shall
kill the South's leader,

02:30.242 --> 02:32.437
on our Great Leader's order...

03:30.067 --> 03:31.329
What the hell?

05:03.027 --> 05:05.791
Stop! We'll shoot!

05:11.469 --> 05:12.834
Stop!

05:15.439 --> 05:17.566
Freeze, you bastard!

05:29.587 --> 05:31.111
You bastard!

05:41.899 --> 05:43.867
Don't move, or we'll shoot!

05:47.538 --> 05:48.835
Throw down the knife!

06:04.255 --> 06:06.155
Throw it down, you bastard!

06:42.193 --> 06:44.260
I am KANG In-chan.

06:44.295 --> 06:46.929
I am special agent
KIM Shin-jo,

06:46.964 --> 06:50.701
from unit 124 of the
People's Republic of Korea.

06:50.736 --> 06:52.835
No home address.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.004
What was your mission?

06:55.039 --> 06:57.974
To rip out
Park Chung-hee's throat.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.478
Then what kind of soldiers

07:02.513 --> 07:05.049
were the deceased
members of the unit?

07:05.084 --> 07:08.150
Gang work was all I could do.

07:08.185 --> 07:15.292
Specialists in murder, arson,
kidnapping, military explosives...

07:15.327 --> 07:18.696
Even though the victim lived,

07:18.731 --> 07:20.561
it was a grisly crime,

07:20.831 --> 07:25.601
planned carefully in advance.

07:25.636 --> 07:29.868
As such, this court's
judgement is as follows.

07:30.241 --> 07:35.406
Defendant KANG In-chan,
sentenced to death.

07:47.591 --> 07:49.752
<i>January 1968</i>

08:11.882 --> 08:13.645
Leave us.

08:16.520 --> 08:17.748
Sit down.

08:33.537 --> 08:35.698
KANG Min-ho
was a fencing master.

08:36.106 --> 08:38.404
Arrested as a resident spy,

08:39.376 --> 08:43.335
he escaped during trial,
and was never found.

08:44.214 --> 08:47.012
Assumed to have
escaped to the North.

08:48.319 --> 08:53.484
You, KANG In-chan, were
his only son. You were 15.

08:54.124 --> 08:57.840
After middle school,
you tried to find work.

08:57.875 --> 09:01.557
You applied 12 times
in 2 years without success.

09:01.865 --> 09:06.815
At 17, you were recruited
by the Jindo gang.

09:06.850 --> 09:11.765
Now, convicted to death
for attempted murder.

09:12.776 --> 09:17.713
This knife, latched onto a life
ruined by your father.

09:18.682 --> 09:20.182
If not for your father,

09:20.217 --> 09:23.187
you wouldn't be
sentenced to death.

09:23.222 --> 09:24.950
Who the hell are you?

09:27.424 --> 09:30.127
Guilt by association.
If you could escape

09:30.162 --> 09:32.322
your father's crimes,

09:32.563 --> 09:35.862
If you could completely
start over again...

09:36.500 --> 09:41.199
...would you wield this
knife for your country?

09:45.609 --> 09:47.668
Over here!

09:50.814 --> 09:52.543
Proceed with the execution!

11:05.489 --> 11:09.653
<i>SILMIDO</i>

11:28.045 --> 11:30.240
What the fuck?

11:36.353 --> 11:38.947
Stupid moron.

11:43.627 --> 11:47.563
You think you're
a big shit, huh?

11:50.134 --> 11:54.537
Hey soldier, if you
got a smoke, give it here.

11:56.673 --> 12:02.009
I'll earn some cash
and buy you a full carton.

12:04.748 --> 12:06.716
Fuck you!

12:07.017 --> 12:10.214
Drop the gun and your badges,
and let's fight man to man!

12:10.521 --> 12:14.218
Thinking you're hot shit
in that uniform.

12:14.691 --> 12:16.852
What are you
looking at, asshole?

12:19.062 --> 12:20.791
You shithead!

12:21.765 --> 12:24.700
Little punk never shuts up.

12:25.669 --> 12:27.762
That's enough.

12:32.609 --> 12:34.474
Damned moron.

12:35.179 --> 12:36.847
What's your problem, huh?

12:36.882 --> 12:38.576
Son of a bitch.

13:09.947 --> 13:12.643
Everyone in the water,
before I count to three.

13:13.150 --> 13:14.267
Go!

13:14.302 --> 13:15.350
Hah!

13:15.385 --> 13:18.088
Why don't you jump in?

13:18.123 --> 13:19.521
One.

13:19.556 --> 13:21.925
It's goddamned freezing!

13:21.960 --> 13:22.758
Two.

13:22.793 --> 13:24.044
Two what?

13:24.079 --> 13:25.466
Three.

13:25.501 --> 13:26.853
So what?

13:58.495 --> 14:01.365
It's okay. If you
stay calm, you float.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.423
Don't panic.

14:22.953 --> 14:24.784
Loyalty!

14:25.922 --> 14:27.424
Pull out only the ones
who are drowning.

14:27.459 --> 14:28.857
Yes, sir!

15:30.287 --> 15:31.216
Loyalty!

15:31.251 --> 15:32.145
Loyalty

15:32.723 --> 15:33.690
Soldiers, in formation!

15:34.391 --> 15:35.859
Soldiers, in formation!

15:35.894 --> 15:37.156
In formation!

15:59.883 --> 16:02.943
As you can see,
I am a soldier.

16:04.354 --> 16:06.820
You are death row convicts,

16:06.855 --> 16:09.286
or men from society's gutter...

16:09.693 --> 16:11.593
...human trash.

16:12.829 --> 16:15.662
But if you
put on this uniform,

16:15.899 --> 16:18.561
our goals become one.

16:19.936 --> 16:21.870
To safeguard our nation,

16:21.905 --> 16:26.103
and to unify our homeland,
we will unite under a single task.

16:26.410 --> 16:28.662
These soldiers and I,

16:28.697 --> 16:30.879
to protect your lives

16:30.914 --> 16:34.907
and our nation's bidding,
will train you.

16:35.218 --> 16:37.836
The training will be
much harsher

16:37.871 --> 16:40.454
than the real task
awaiting you.

16:40.724 --> 16:44.751
We will make no effort
to ensure your safety.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.763
However on the day
you achieve your goal,

16:48.064 --> 16:50.912
you'll be able to
face the world

16:50.947 --> 16:53.761
as Korea's proudest soldiers.

16:54.337 --> 16:57.966
Those who are prepared,
put on these uniforms.

17:11.788 --> 17:14.356
Nowhere else to go.

17:14.391 --> 17:17.260
And no clue how to
get out of here.

17:17.295 --> 17:19.830
Shit, we're dead either way.

17:19.865 --> 17:21.296
Damn right!

17:21.331 --> 17:24.334
I spent each day risking
my life back home, too.

17:24.369 --> 17:25.733
Attention!

17:27.204 --> 17:29.104
From now, you are

17:29.139 --> 17:32.939
members of Korean
special unit 684.

17:33.410 --> 17:35.105
Our unit's mission is...

17:36.513 --> 17:40.711
...to go to Pyongyang and
slit the throat of Kim Il-sung.

18:55.625 --> 18:57.060
Run, you bastards!

18:57.095 --> 18:58.391
Hurry!

19:00.263 --> 19:01.696
Heads down!

19:06.403 --> 19:10.205
Kim Shin-jo's unit 124,

19:10.240 --> 19:12.976
in order to slit our
president's throat,

19:13.011 --> 19:15.645
sent 31 men across the border.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.272
They failed.

19:17.514 --> 19:20.817
But the 31 men in our unit 684,

19:20.852 --> 19:23.270
must be one second faster,

19:23.305 --> 19:25.654
and move one step farther,

19:25.689 --> 19:28.852
then we will surely slit
Kim Il-sung's throat!

19:30.460 --> 19:35.022
Climb faster!

19:40.003 --> 19:43.166
Faster, you bastards!

19:50.880 --> 19:52.681
Faster, I said!

19:52.716 --> 19:55.048
Faster, you bastards!

21:21.705 --> 21:23.730
Gimme a real target...

21:30.146 --> 21:32.015
What are you doing, bastard?!

21:32.050 --> 21:33.209
Yes, sir!

21:49.532 --> 21:50.750
Tired?

21:50.785 --> 21:51.910
No, sir.

21:51.945 --> 21:53.024
Tired?

21:53.059 --> 21:53.965
No, sir!

21:54.000 --> 21:55.300
Tired?

21:55.335 --> 21:56.600
No, sir!

21:57.240 --> 21:58.821
To the right!

21:58.856 --> 22:00.403
On your hands!

22:07.117 --> 22:08.982
Did you waste enough
bullets, you bastards?

22:12.555 --> 22:14.055
Are you training these men?

22:14.090 --> 22:16.581
You're wasting your
country's money.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.693
On your backs.

22:18.728 --> 22:21.561
You think we can send
those babies to Pyongyang?

22:26.703 --> 22:30.854
They'll all be killed before
reaching the border.

22:30.889 --> 22:35.006
If you are captured,
your best option is suicide.

22:35.278 --> 22:38.093
We will provide
you with tools

22:38.128 --> 22:40.909
for a quick and
precise suicide.

22:41.384 --> 22:44.217
You must learn the
methods thoroughly.

22:45.155 --> 22:47.419
But if you fail in suicide,

22:47.891 --> 22:52.760
you will face
continuous torture.

22:54.130 --> 22:58.794
If you scream
during these drills,

23:00.069 --> 23:04.529
it is the same as revealing
secrets to your enemies.

23:04.808 --> 23:07.038
Revealing this information...

23:07.310 --> 23:11.576
...puts the lives of the whole
unit in your enemies' hands.

23:12.282 --> 23:13.681
Ready!

23:14.751 --> 23:15.615
Proceed!

23:15.785 --> 23:16.877
Proceed!

23:54.424 --> 23:57.327
I burn easily, you know?

23:57.362 --> 23:58.692
Shut up!

23:59.462 --> 24:00.724
Ready!

24:01.731 --> 24:05.326
Ouch!

24:06.035 --> 24:08.401
Oh that hurts!

24:26.256 --> 24:27.223
Proceed!

24:27.423 --> 24:28.583
Proceed!

24:32.929 --> 24:36.160
Ouch!

24:53.716 --> 24:57.083
Down! Get up!

24:58.354 --> 25:02.484
On your back! Get up!

25:08.064 --> 25:11.968
It can't have been easy.
What did you think to endure it?

25:12.003 --> 25:14.960
That I must go to Pyongyang!

25:18.274 --> 25:23.576
Well... that bastard
did it, so...

25:27.317 --> 25:30.309
After leading my gang
members all those years,

25:30.687 --> 25:34.054
is there anything
I can't endure?

25:37.160 --> 25:38.728
Divide them into teams.

25:38.763 --> 25:40.286
Yes, sir!

25:47.070 --> 25:49.004
Shit!

26:07.690 --> 26:08.990
Crouch down!

26:09.025 --> 26:10.583
Down, you bastard!

26:17.066 --> 26:19.557
Shit, are you telling
me what to do?

26:27.944 --> 26:29.178
That's enough.

26:29.213 --> 26:30.230
I can fight!

26:30.766 --> 26:31.713
Open your mouth.

26:31.748 --> 26:32.781
I can fight, sergeant!

26:32.816 --> 26:35.819
- Open your mouth!
- I can fight!

26:35.854 --> 26:36.911
Go on.

26:38.788 --> 26:40.881
I'm going to tear you apart!

26:53.803 --> 26:55.668
Winner, captain of team 3!

26:58.742 --> 27:00.573
Team 1, gather your full gear.

27:03.547 --> 27:04.844
Run faster!

27:06.082 --> 27:08.267
Crouch down, huh?

27:08.302 --> 27:10.453
What the hell?!

27:10.488 --> 27:11.319
Yes, sir!

27:11.354 --> 27:12.789
You see me later.

27:12.824 --> 27:13.847
Yes!

27:25.035 --> 27:26.903
Out of the way!

27:26.938 --> 27:28.200
Yes, sir!

27:37.447 --> 27:38.573
Captain!

27:42.218 --> 27:43.932
Come on and fight, asshole.

27:43.967 --> 27:45.647
I'm gonna tear you apart.

27:45.956 --> 27:47.322
What the hell?

27:47.357 --> 27:51.526
Fuck this! Fighting
with gloves like girls.

27:51.561 --> 27:54.331
Quitting at the first sign
of blood, let's fight!

27:54.366 --> 27:56.390
I can finish you
off in a second.

27:59.369 --> 28:02.606
You're gonna be pissing
your pants, you coward.

28:02.641 --> 28:04.699
Who's the coward?

28:05.275 --> 28:07.811
Who's picking fights
after losing in the ring?

28:07.846 --> 28:09.411
Shut up, you!

28:09.446 --> 28:11.981
Your captain
just kept punching

28:12.016 --> 28:14.517
the same bruise,
didn't you see?

28:14.552 --> 28:15.717
You!

28:15.752 --> 28:17.854
That's called strategy.

28:17.889 --> 28:20.049
Shut your mouth!

28:20.323 --> 28:23.293
Because of you,
we keep getting extra drills!

28:23.328 --> 28:26.163
That's because
you got a lousy captain.

28:26.198 --> 28:28.999
Let's finish this
once and for all!

28:29.034 --> 28:31.399
Stop showing off,
let's fight!

28:33.169 --> 28:34.261
Hey!

28:39.776 --> 28:44.748
Swear now that the loser will
slit his throat with this.

28:44.783 --> 28:46.409
Then start fighting.

28:47.217 --> 28:49.117
That's better, ain't it?

28:49.786 --> 28:51.620
Or else you'll fight,

28:51.655 --> 28:55.523
and the barracks
sergeant'll nab us,

28:57.494 --> 28:59.027
and we'll be out

28:59.062 --> 29:02.297
all night getting flogged.

29:02.332 --> 29:05.392
Then later you'll
want to fight again...

29:05.835 --> 29:08.071
If you swear that one
of you will end it,

29:08.106 --> 29:10.068
then we'll put up

29:10.103 --> 29:12.031
with it this once.

29:12.442 --> 29:13.909
Got it?

29:19.182 --> 29:23.016
If you won't fight to kill,
then don't bother.

29:25.255 --> 29:27.086
Fucking bastard!

29:55.652 --> 29:56.778
What the hell?

30:00.985 --> 30:04.254
We'll take the same route
those commie bastards used.

30:04.289 --> 30:08.493
After killing Kim Il-sung,
they will take out the defense dept,

30:08.528 --> 30:10.326
and the dept of armed forces.

30:10.361 --> 30:14.229
Going by land will take
a week, that's too long.

30:14.599 --> 30:18.034
Kim Shin-jo's group
failed because of time.

30:18.069 --> 30:22.199
Our 684 can surely outperform
those Unit 124 bastards.

30:22.907 --> 30:24.607
I'll make sure they do.

30:24.642 --> 30:27.245
If they go by sea,
they can go up Daedong River,

30:27.280 --> 30:30.114
and take Yanggak Rd.
To Mt. Moran.

30:30.149 --> 30:31.581
Then they could reach

30:31.616 --> 30:34.551
Kim's residence in an hour.

30:34.586 --> 30:36.487
They must do more than
just kill Kim Il-sung.

30:36.522 --> 30:37.954
There are only 30 of them.

30:38.156 --> 30:41.092
Just concentrating on Kim
won't improve their chances.

30:41.127 --> 30:42.423
Sergeant Park!

30:42.627 --> 30:45.563
By sea they can reach
Imjin River in 22 hours.

30:45.598 --> 30:46.896
They can attack and

30:46.931 --> 30:49.764
leave Daedong River
by 5am next day.

30:50.001 --> 30:52.086
Two days will be enough

30:52.121 --> 30:54.172
for the whole operation.

30:54.207 --> 30:55.537
It's not possible.

30:56.207 --> 30:59.301
- Swimming that far will be...
- Possible.

31:02.080 --> 31:04.640
It's a course I've often taken.

32:58.262 --> 32:59.923
42 seconds!

33:00.798 --> 33:02.265
End it at 65 seconds.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.384
Not yet...

33:04.419 --> 33:05.768
Yes, sir!

33:07.405 --> 33:10.241
Each group has 65 seconds
to complete the task.

33:10.276 --> 33:12.041
One second over,

33:12.076 --> 33:14.203
and you'll be riddled with bullets.

33:31.596 --> 33:34.030
- Soldiers, take position!
- In position!

33:34.866 --> 33:36.663
What are you doing?

33:38.302 --> 33:40.600
Are you gonna
kill us all?

33:41.873 --> 33:43.431
Shut up!

33:44.408 --> 33:45.898
What the fuck?

33:46.944 --> 33:48.813
You see me later!

33:48.848 --> 33:50.405
Anytime!

34:11.636 --> 34:13.570
Hurry up, you bastards!

34:40.898 --> 34:42.798
Shit, they're fast.

34:43.067 --> 34:45.636
We're gonna be running
laps because of them.

34:45.671 --> 34:47.365
Shut your trap!

34:56.314 --> 34:57.838
What's wrong?

35:06.090 --> 35:08.957
Kim Ji-yong!
Hang from below!

35:13.064 --> 35:14.292
Hurry up!

35:34.552 --> 35:36.281
Soldiers, at ease!

36:31.409 --> 36:33.468
It was a splendid decision.

36:33.778 --> 36:36.372
If you had paused
to save one life,

36:36.814 --> 36:39.408
all of you would've died.

36:40.084 --> 36:44.987
If the same situation occurs
in the future, remember today.

36:45.356 --> 36:46.721
Understood?

36:47.291 --> 36:49.020
Yes, sir.

36:49.226 --> 36:50.659
Understood?

36:50.995 --> 36:52.758
Yes, sir.

36:52.964 --> 36:54.454
Understood?

36:54.598 --> 36:57.066
Yes, sir!

37:09.447 --> 37:11.142
- Loyalty!
- Loyalty!

37:15.419 --> 37:17.683
PARK Chan-seok, get up.

37:23.594 --> 37:25.323
Please let me stay!

37:27.999 --> 37:30.935
It's not possible to
treat you here. Get up!

37:30.970 --> 37:32.637
If you put me back in jail,

37:32.672 --> 37:34.768
I don't want
to live each day

37:34.803 --> 37:36.865
wondering if I'll be hanged.

37:37.608 --> 37:39.375
You told us

37:39.410 --> 37:43.710
if we go to Pyongyang
and kill Kim Il-sung,

37:44.015 --> 37:47.246
we could live,
we'd get money,

37:47.485 --> 37:50.821
we could even
become officers.

37:50.856 --> 37:52.254
Stop it!

37:52.790 --> 37:55.190
What can you do
with that body?

37:55.760 --> 37:57.022
Get up.

37:58.562 --> 38:00.393
I'll cook or clean,

38:01.265 --> 38:03.699
I'll clean out
the toilet.

38:03.734 --> 38:06.133
I'll do whatever you ask!

38:07.838 --> 38:11.171
Why don't you just kill me?

38:11.609 --> 38:13.076
Sergeant!

38:17.148 --> 38:19.116
If someone does all this,

38:19.884 --> 38:22.368
we can concentrate
on training.

38:22.403 --> 38:24.853
It's more efficient,
is it not?

38:26.257 --> 38:27.815
What do you all think?

38:29.226 --> 38:31.023
What is there to think?

38:31.395 --> 38:33.727
Look of it
from his position.

38:35.199 --> 38:37.415
What crazy fool would

38:37.450 --> 38:39.631
ever want to go back?

38:43.374 --> 38:44.739
Silence!

38:46.944 --> 38:50.311
Can you prepare decent
meals for your colleagues?

38:50.781 --> 38:54.501
Yes! I raised three younger
brothers on my own.

38:54.536 --> 38:58.222
Kimchi stew, bean paste stew,
whatever you want.

38:58.257 --> 38:59.690
Can you do grilled squid?

38:59.725 --> 39:02.258
You wash your hands

39:02.293 --> 39:04.824
after taking a crap,
or you're dead!

39:04.859 --> 39:07.355
So we don't have
to peel potatoes?

39:07.565 --> 39:09.499
Hey, that punk's
going to live?

39:15.005 --> 39:16.302
Loyalty!

39:18.375 --> 39:19.375
I can't believe it.

39:19.410 --> 39:22.847
It's a good opportunity.
It'll strengthen their mindset.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.348
Covering up their
hard feelings

39:24.383 --> 39:26.407
after a man was killed?

39:28.619 --> 39:30.086
What do you want to say?

39:30.121 --> 39:32.990
If we'd stopped the drill,
we could have saved him.

39:33.025 --> 39:34.924
If it were just
a drill, yes.

39:35.192 --> 39:38.753
But we don't do drills here.
Didn't you know?

39:40.564 --> 39:42.395
You're always thinking.

39:43.234 --> 39:45.431
This is right,
that's wrong...

39:45.466 --> 39:47.628
- Is thinking wrong?
- It is.

39:48.272 --> 39:49.940
This isn't a unit
where you get

39:49.975 --> 39:51.965
commended for running laps.

39:52.810 --> 39:54.675
Don't forget where you are.

39:55.412 --> 39:57.039
This is Silmido.

40:03.020 --> 40:05.750
Fuck...

43:08.639 --> 43:12.276
I've been to
Pyongyang over 20 times,

43:12.311 --> 43:15.575
but I never dreamed

43:15.813 --> 43:19.874
of killing Kim
or blowing up his palace.

43:20.351 --> 43:24.310
There was no way
I could have.

43:25.856 --> 43:29.792
I never had
colleagues like you.

43:34.264 --> 43:37.495
You depart tomorrow night.

43:52.649 --> 43:58.622
To the strongest 31 men,
including the deceased!

43:58.657 --> 44:00.317
To the 31!

44:06.964 --> 44:10.334
Stay within the grounds,
and enjoy yourself tonight.

44:10.369 --> 44:12.301
Yes, sir!

44:12.336 --> 44:14.930
Supervising soldiers
will eat separately.

44:15.139 --> 44:17.733
- In position!
- In position!

44:22.579 --> 44:26.083
This just melts in the mouth.
What's it made of?

44:26.118 --> 44:28.152
- It's made from snakes!
- Snakes?

44:28.187 --> 44:30.219
They're all over the place.

44:30.254 --> 44:33.288
This is great,
but we need women!

44:33.323 --> 44:36.727
If you drink this,
you stay hard all night, huh?

44:36.762 --> 44:38.427
Hey!

44:38.462 --> 44:39.813
Give me another cup.

44:39.848 --> 44:41.165
Give me one too.

44:41.200 --> 44:42.297
Me too!

44:42.332 --> 44:44.066
Drink slower, assholes!

44:44.101 --> 44:46.001
Just give me
the whole kettle.

44:46.036 --> 44:49.885
Don't you worry, guys.
Drink it slowly.

44:49.920 --> 44:53.734
I've been stowing this
away for months.

45:09.526 --> 45:11.076
What are you doing?

45:11.111 --> 45:12.626
You're reviewing now?

45:13.030 --> 45:14.331
Our work is done.

45:14.366 --> 45:15.130
What?

45:15.165 --> 45:16.530
It's true.

45:16.967 --> 45:20.232
It's all in their hands now.

45:52.970 --> 45:54.597
Turn!

45:56.874 --> 45:59.541
Turn, turn!

45:59.576 --> 46:01.278
Turn? What the hell?

46:01.313 --> 46:02.802
Ah, yes sir.

46:04.648 --> 46:08.379
Don't turn, don't turn!

46:15.692 --> 46:20.459
You bastards!
You've got to come back!

46:21.164 --> 46:24.190
You need to
come back alive!

46:25.168 --> 46:26.863
You have to live,

46:28.038 --> 46:37.003
I'm 684 too, so we can shout
that we re-unified the nation!

46:37.714 --> 46:40.415
We'll take the money...

46:40.450 --> 46:45.355
Shut up, you bastard!
Shut your mouth!

46:45.390 --> 46:47.789
You've got to live!

46:49.159 --> 46:52.160
Don't die!

46:52.195 --> 46:55.665
That son of a bitch.
Let me go!

46:55.700 --> 46:58.285
He's drunk.
You stop it, too!

46:58.320 --> 47:01.130
No matter how drunk he is,

47:01.165 --> 47:03.599
the moron shouldn't say that!

47:03.634 --> 47:06.034
Just come back alive, huh?

47:06.610 --> 47:10.380
We've done our best,
what more can we do?

47:10.415 --> 47:11.882
We can't die after all this...

47:11.917 --> 47:13.713
Who said we'll die?

47:13.951 --> 47:17.216
Stop talking about dying,
for Christ's sake!

47:18.522 --> 47:19.921
Who do you think we are?

47:20.290 --> 47:24.560
We're unit 684!
We're not gonna die!

47:24.595 --> 47:27.564
Who's gonna kill us?
Nobody can touch us!

47:27.599 --> 47:30.294
That's right!
We're invincible.

47:42.779 --> 47:52.189
<i>Until the East Sea dries up
and Mt. Baektu crumbles,</i>

47:52.224 --> 47:57.388
<i>God will protect us...</i>

48:02.099 --> 48:07.838
Try to understand them,
they're scared inside.

48:07.873 --> 48:09.362
Are you...?

48:12.175 --> 48:15.372
What? Is something wrong?

48:15.746 --> 48:17.543
Aren't you scared, sir?

48:19.650 --> 48:23.950
Lighten up, don't call me sir.

48:25.255 --> 48:27.314
I'm just 21 years old.

48:27.991 --> 48:33.429
All this time, it's really
pained me to yell at you so.

48:33.697 --> 48:37.360
You softie, how do
you manage it here?

48:38.935 --> 48:42.632
They'll all get back
safely, won't they?

48:45.609 --> 48:47.600
Of course.

48:47.978 --> 48:52.677
That's why we suffered
through all these hardships.

49:14.671 --> 49:16.195
Fight tooth and nail!

49:19.976 --> 49:24.470
Courage! There is
no second place!

49:38.195 --> 49:43.155
The historic re-unification
of Korea begins now.

49:43.667 --> 49:47.626
You will be writing the
first page of this history.

49:47.938 --> 49:52.500
For this day, you have staked
your lives and youth.

49:53.143 --> 49:56.772
The last thing Kim Il-sung will
see as he leaves this world...

49:57.013 --> 50:01.450
are the guns and knives
of the glorious unit 684!

50:02.152 --> 50:05.144
Pierce his throat with the
Korean flag and return home.

50:05.756 --> 50:11.820
Your bravery and sacrifice
will be remembered always.

50:12.195 --> 50:17.030
Those who return to
an undivided peninsula

50:17.234 --> 50:20.601
will live as the nation's
greatest heroes.

50:20.904 --> 50:23.338
Long live the
Republic of Korea!

50:23.540 --> 50:25.633
Long live the
Republic of Korea!

50:25.942 --> 50:28.172
Long live our
reunified nation!

50:28.345 --> 50:30.609
Long live our
reunified nation!

50:30.814 --> 50:33.544
Long live unit 684!

50:33.717 --> 50:37.278
Long live unit 684!

51:18.528 --> 51:19.995
Attention!

51:20.831 --> 51:22.280
Salute!

51:22.315 --> 51:23.729
Loyalty!

51:52.362 --> 51:53.624
Loyalty!

52:20.423 --> 52:23.017
Yes, drill captain speaking.

52:25.228 --> 52:26.661
Yes?

52:31.902 --> 52:34.996
Yes, I understand.

52:40.844 --> 52:42.141
Sergeant Jo.

54:17.974 --> 54:21.432
The operation is cancelled.
Turn back!

54:22.379 --> 54:25.678
Don't pay attention,
just row!

54:30.854 --> 54:34.290
Bastards. Turn back!

54:34.557 --> 54:38.126
Keep going!

54:38.161 --> 54:41.688
Stop! We got an order
from above to turn back.

54:41.931 --> 54:45.697
If we go back, we'll
receive the order soon.

54:45.869 --> 54:48.463
Can't we just go on
and slit his throat?

54:48.705 --> 54:50.901
You need to get permission

54:50.936 --> 54:53.097
from those bastards first!

54:53.309 --> 54:55.974
What are you doing?
Keep rowing!

54:56.009 --> 54:58.639
I don't want to
do this, either!

55:28.211 --> 55:29.546
Pull them out one at a time.

55:29.581 --> 55:30.945
I won't go!

55:31.781 --> 55:34.100
Please let us go!

55:34.135 --> 55:35.944
We can do it!

55:35.979 --> 55:38.384
We will do it!

55:38.419 --> 55:40.755
We will succeed!

55:40.790 --> 55:45.124
You assholes! Let us go!

55:58.007 --> 55:59.531
Loyalty!

56:00.243 --> 56:01.608
At ease.

56:13.389 --> 56:16.552
Please at least give us
a date for the operation.

56:16.793 --> 56:19.193
It's not for me
to decide that.

56:19.429 --> 56:22.728
They were at the sharpest state
of readiness, right on schedule.

56:23.233 --> 56:23.998
Excellent work.

56:24.033 --> 56:25.968
Keeping them
at this state is

56:26.003 --> 56:27.869
like ignoring a ticking bomb.

56:27.904 --> 56:29.806
Whether this unit is
a ticking time bomb,

56:29.841 --> 56:31.840
or crack soldiers,

56:31.875 --> 56:34.509
is a question of
your ability, isn't it?

56:34.544 --> 56:37.363
Can you at least tell us
the reason for the cancellation?

56:37.398 --> 56:40.183
The chief of intelligence who
created the unit was replaced,

56:40.218 --> 56:43.380
so there isn't even
anyone to ask, is there?

56:45.221 --> 56:48.452
You're knocking at the
wrong address here.

56:57.333 --> 56:59.062
Give me some more.

56:59.302 --> 57:01.429
Other people have
to eat, too.

57:01.771 --> 57:04.085
Okay, but give me more.

57:04.120 --> 57:06.400
I won't eat next time.

57:07.610 --> 57:09.237
Give it to him.

57:14.184 --> 57:16.948
Shit, this is embarrassing.

57:18.788 --> 57:20.290
Team 1, in position.

57:20.325 --> 57:21.917
In position.

57:22.225 --> 57:23.593
Team 2, in position.

57:23.628 --> 57:25.185
In position.

57:25.628 --> 57:27.459
Begin shooting!

57:53.990 --> 57:56.390
Where are you
shooting, asshole?

57:57.894 --> 58:03.299
Our drill captain taught us
to kill with a single shot.

58:03.334 --> 58:09.397
For that, you must hit
the head, the heart, or...

58:10.673 --> 58:12.573
his thing.

58:15.712 --> 58:17.412
You little shit!

58:17.447 --> 58:20.717
But if it just hangs
there too long,

58:20.752 --> 58:25.780
you feel dead anyway.

58:27.624 --> 58:29.090
You...!

58:29.125 --> 58:31.616
Just quit it, alright?

58:35.898 --> 58:38.162
What are you gonna do?

58:43.172 --> 58:46.300
That bastard has stood
there for 2 years, too.

58:46.943 --> 58:51.039
For two years he keeps getting
hit in the head and heart.

58:51.414 --> 58:56.613
So I'm blasting away
that useless part.

58:58.021 --> 59:00.888
Charge!

59:14.604 --> 59:16.799
Are you okay, Lt. Kim?

59:17.273 --> 59:19.774
My penis is also okay.

59:19.809 --> 59:22.644
You must look after
your penis well.

59:22.679 --> 59:27.844
Your penis does not belong
only to you, understand?

59:29.852 --> 59:31.444
Do not worry.

59:31.654 --> 59:35.090
I shall remain hard,
and return home.

59:35.758 --> 59:37.419
As you must.

59:38.194 --> 59:44.463
Return home safe and hard
to plug Young-sook.

59:44.867 --> 59:47.358
It's not Young-sook,
it's Sook-ja!

59:47.637 --> 59:52.472
Can you not plug both Young-sook
and Sook-ja, my friend?

59:55.945 --> 59:59.881
Young-sook, Sook-ja or
Hee-ja... just bring her over.

1:00:00.183 --> 1:00:03.584
I'll keep her going for
4 days and 3 nights.

1:00:03.986 --> 1:00:05.783
On their way over,

1:00:05.955 --> 1:00:09.982
tell them to bring
soup, rice and kimchi.

1:00:10.226 --> 1:00:12.177
I'm so damned hungry

1:00:12.212 --> 1:00:14.129
I can't even get it up.

1:00:27.176 --> 1:00:28.509
What is it?

1:00:28.544 --> 1:00:31.447
I need to go to the bathroom.
My stomach...

1:00:31.482 --> 1:00:32.744
Go on.

1:00:35.852 --> 1:00:37.870
I need to go, too.

1:00:37.905 --> 1:00:39.854
Give me a break!

1:00:39.889 --> 1:00:42.358
We were so hungry earlier,
and there was a tree with...

1:00:42.393 --> 1:00:43.848
Hurry up!

1:01:01.244 --> 1:01:02.210
Loyalty!

1:01:02.245 --> 1:01:05.214
Loyalty my ass, you idiots!

1:01:06.716 --> 1:01:08.581
I warned you especially.

1:01:08.751 --> 1:01:12.414
Be careful of the low tide,
when the islands are connected!

1:01:13.689 --> 1:01:15.589
Assemble on the grounds!

1:01:16.492 --> 1:01:18.084
Hurry up!

1:01:33.509 --> 1:01:35.409
Let me do it.

1:01:36.712 --> 1:01:38.441
Stop, will you?

1:01:44.954 --> 1:01:46.751
I can't believe you.

1:01:50.326 --> 1:01:52.055
I wasn't done yet!

1:01:52.228 --> 1:01:53.695
You've gone limp!

1:01:59.890 --> 1:02:03.290
We're not this way usually.

1:02:04.327 --> 1:02:09.094
We really didn't
want to do this.

1:02:44.361 --> 1:02:45.590
Hey!

1:02:48.730 --> 1:02:55.602
You bastard, we're dead!

1:02:58.173 --> 1:03:00.038
Hey you pigs!

1:03:00.208 --> 1:03:02.937
Do you think you
can escape from me?

1:03:03.077 --> 1:03:05.170
Not before you die.

1:03:05.679 --> 1:03:07.844
Run your asses
out here now!

1:03:07.881 --> 1:03:10.178
Come out before we
tear you to pieces!

1:03:17.356 --> 1:03:22.089
Keep away!
I'll kill this doctor.

1:03:22.126 --> 1:03:26.425
Go ahead. You think I'm
scared to kill one broad?

1:03:26.663 --> 1:03:29.188
I can toss a grenade
and kill you all.

1:03:29.366 --> 1:03:31.031
End it quickly.

1:03:31.066 --> 1:03:33.159
Why get her killed too?

1:03:33.402 --> 1:03:36.028
Let her go and come out.

1:03:36.905 --> 1:03:39.607
If we free her,
will you let us live?

1:03:39.641 --> 1:03:40.840
Wake up!

1:03:40.876 --> 1:03:43.810
After 2 years, don't you
know them by now?

1:03:43.845 --> 1:03:45.470
You think I don't?

1:03:45.647 --> 1:03:47.772
We'll give you three minutes.

1:03:49.347 --> 1:03:52.252
When they're scared, it's
no use trying to talk to them.

1:03:52.286 --> 1:03:54.276
First, let them calm down.

1:03:55.654 --> 1:03:57.247
Sergeants 1,2,3!

1:04:03.061 --> 1:04:06.517
Say something, huh?

1:04:16.637 --> 1:04:18.366
You know what?

1:04:18.973 --> 1:04:24.434
The officers' pistols
are to use for suicide.

1:04:25.046 --> 1:04:28.879
Stop thinking
and just come out!

1:04:44.728 --> 1:04:50.099
When you're born again,
be the son of a rich family.

1:04:51.666 --> 1:04:53.362
You too, bastard.

1:05:12.719 --> 1:05:14.584
Don't do it!

1:05:17.789 --> 1:05:19.620
Jae-yong! Jae-yong!

1:05:19.991 --> 1:05:21.719
Shut up, you!

1:05:22.626 --> 1:05:24.060
Escape.

1:05:24.261 --> 1:05:25.991
Rape of a civilian.

1:05:26.264 --> 1:05:28.164
Disobeying orders.

1:05:29.332 --> 1:05:33.996
An unthinkable incident has
threatened the honor of 684.

1:05:34.804 --> 1:05:37.796
We will re-educate you
in place of punishment.

1:05:38.074 --> 1:05:43.704
So that this
never happens again.

1:05:45.681 --> 1:05:50.275
Physical training will
restore your weakened mind.

1:05:51.417 --> 1:05:53.485
With each blow,

1:05:53.519 --> 1:05:59.217
remember that one person's
betrayal endangers all of unit 684.

1:06:00.192 --> 1:06:01.090
Proceed!

1:06:01.293 --> 1:06:02.816
Proceed!

1:06:10.067 --> 1:06:11.625
It's okay.

1:06:14.438 --> 1:06:19.806
Let's receive it from you,
rather than the drill captain.

1:06:46.798 --> 1:06:50.130
Don't lie down, your back
will get injured. Get up!

1:07:01.844 --> 1:07:05.336
What are you
looking at, assholes?

1:07:05.948 --> 1:07:07.642
Now I can die.

1:07:07.815 --> 1:07:11.718
I did it with a woman!
I did it!

1:07:11.953 --> 1:07:13.580
I sucked her breasts too.

1:07:14.320 --> 1:07:15.912
Hey, Chang-shik!

1:07:16.089 --> 1:07:19.454
I'm not jerking off
with my hand like you.

1:07:19.761 --> 1:07:25.959
Duk-young! Other guys rape you,
but you never get any yourself.

1:07:27.199 --> 1:07:29.690
Stop hitting me!

1:07:31.369 --> 1:07:33.065
Shut up!

1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:46.808
Soldiers' corpses are wrapped
in a bloody people's flag.

1:07:47.116 --> 1:07:52.955
<i>Before the bodies
turn cold and stiff,</i>

1:07:52.991 --> 1:07:58.023
<i>the blood stains the flag red.</i>

1:07:58.059 --> 1:08:03.062
<i>Raise it to the sky,
the red-stained bloody flag</i>

1:08:03.098 --> 1:08:07.764
<i>and beneath it,
make a solemn vow.</i>

1:08:07.801 --> 1:08:12.770
<i>Cowards can leave,
if they wish to go.</i>

1:08:12.806 --> 1:08:17.708
<i>We will remain
to protect our flag.</i>

1:08:17.741 --> 1:08:25.649
<i>Our red-stained company...
... military service...</i>

1:08:51.071 --> 1:08:52.264
Hey!

1:09:26.899 --> 1:09:28.333
Don't move!

1:09:35.306 --> 1:09:36.774
What's the meaning of this?

1:09:36.942 --> 1:09:38.705
I did as I was taught.

1:09:39.143 --> 1:09:43.514
You said to remove anything
that hinders our unit.

1:09:43.548 --> 1:09:47.885
This crazy fool is
no longer useful to unit 684.

1:09:47.919 --> 1:09:49.943
So I killed him.

1:09:51.186 --> 1:09:52.585
Line up the soldiers.

1:09:56.491 --> 1:09:59.927
Move to the platform.
Line up in groups!

1:10:00.527 --> 1:10:02.552
Please send us to Pyongyang.

1:10:04.397 --> 1:10:08.858
Beat us or kill us,
I don't care. Just send us.

1:10:20.677 --> 1:10:32.155
<i>Soldiers' corpses are wrapped
in a bloody people's flag.</i>

1:10:32.190 --> 1:10:37.727
<i>Before the bodies
turn cold and stiff,</i>

1:10:37.761 --> 1:10:43.362
<i>the blood stains the flag red.</i>

1:10:43.398 --> 1:10:45.499
<i>- Raise it to the sky...
- Hey!</i>

1:10:45.535 --> 1:10:47.398
Let him be.

1:10:49.435 --> 1:10:54.555
<i>...and beneath it,
make a solemn vow.</i>

1:10:54.591 --> 1:10:59.700
<i>Cowards can leave,
if they wish to go.</i>

1:10:59.735 --> 1:11:04.807
<i>We will remain
to protect our flag.</i>

1:11:05.516 --> 1:11:08.450
You! Get up.

1:11:11.189 --> 1:11:12.711
Get up!

1:11:23.198 --> 1:11:27.963
He was mine.
I should have done him in.

1:11:29.703 --> 1:11:31.864
Shit.

1:11:35.942 --> 1:11:38.570
Don't hang your shoulders.

1:11:38.777 --> 1:11:40.608
You did nothing wrong.

1:12:13.439 --> 1:12:14.872
Smarten up, will you?

1:12:19.644 --> 1:12:20.805
Get up!

1:12:22.881 --> 1:12:25.975
Why is he getting more
and more out of control?

1:12:26.250 --> 1:12:27.851
What have you
been doing, huh?

1:12:27.886 --> 1:12:29.217
I'll do better, sir!

1:12:29.452 --> 1:12:33.081
If I see one more spark
of life in that commie's eyes,

1:12:33.657 --> 1:12:35.792
I'll kill you. Got it?

1:12:35.826 --> 1:12:37.622
Yes, sir!

1:12:42.998 --> 1:12:45.023
Asshole.

1:12:49.203 --> 1:12:50.898
I will wait.

1:12:56.578 --> 1:12:59.840
I will wait.
I understand.

1:13:03.714 --> 1:13:05.875
Drill captain, unit 684.

1:13:13.024 --> 1:13:16.220
North-South relations
keep changing all the time,

1:13:16.827 --> 1:13:21.262
When unit 684 was created,
people in the streets

1:13:21.298 --> 1:13:24.630
would burn pictures of
Kim Il-sung, that was the mood.

1:13:24.899 --> 1:13:27.368
This is a unit created to
fulfill the nation's aims.

1:13:27.402 --> 1:13:31.167
If those aims vanish, the nation
must take responsibility.

1:13:31.439 --> 1:13:32.705
What sort of responsibility?

1:13:32.739 --> 1:13:35.473
Recognize unit 684 as a
formal unit of the air force.

1:13:35.508 --> 1:13:37.878
There's no reason why the
air force should be responsible.

1:13:37.911 --> 1:13:40.246
The instructors and soldiers
under me are from the air force.

1:13:40.282 --> 1:13:43.703
Look here, don't you
understand what I'm saying?

1:13:43.983 --> 1:13:46.316
We provided the training
and transportation,

1:13:46.351 --> 1:13:51.185
but central intelligence
was in charge from the start.

1:13:51.489 --> 1:13:55.426
The people who established the
unit have all been discharged,

1:13:55.460 --> 1:13:58.528
you know the situation
better than I do!

1:13:58.562 --> 1:14:00.620
The members of unit 684...

1:14:02.064 --> 1:14:04.782
are being treated
worse than prisoners.

1:14:04.818 --> 1:14:07.502
Weren't they all
prisoners to begin with?

1:14:14.975 --> 1:14:17.171
Good afternoon!

1:14:17.978 --> 1:14:20.673
I heard you had
an esteemed guest.

1:14:22.649 --> 1:14:26.744
Excellent work.
My name is Oh.

1:14:29.555 --> 1:14:32.487
Have a seat.
Let's talk while sitting.

1:14:33.891 --> 1:14:38.486
So, will we be able to put
Silmido in order?

1:14:38.694 --> 1:14:42.151
We were just discussing that.

1:14:43.100 --> 1:14:45.569
One must discard
the relics of

1:14:45.602 --> 1:14:48.036
past ages to
open a new age.

1:14:48.071 --> 1:14:51.027
Is unit 684 a relic?

1:14:54.008 --> 1:14:57.135
The nation is moving
towards peaceful reunification.

1:14:57.379 --> 1:15:00.370
The murder unit made by the
dismissed chief of intelligence...

1:15:00.580 --> 1:15:02.571
...is a relic, is it not?

1:15:03.983 --> 1:15:07.753
Ordering death row convicts
to slit Kim Il-sung?셲 throat,

1:15:07.788 --> 1:15:10.848
indulging in
dehumanizing training...

1:15:12.056 --> 1:15:16.026
If the foreign press hears,
they'll think we're savages.

1:15:16.062 --> 1:15:19.223
It's shameful, yes.

1:15:21.599 --> 1:15:25.232
Our drill captain still has
good years ahead of him.

1:15:25.267 --> 1:15:30.539
With his wide training and 20
secret missions into the North,

1:15:30.574 --> 1:15:33.029
he was placed
in charge at Silmido.

1:15:34.875 --> 1:15:41.007
If this situation is cleaned up,
his career will be looking up.

1:15:41.147 --> 1:15:42.945
Won't it, General?

1:15:43.316 --> 1:15:45.112
Yes, of course.

1:15:47.420 --> 1:15:49.010
I put my trust in you.

1:15:50.422 --> 1:15:55.018
It's all for the good
of the country, isn't it?

1:15:55.192 --> 1:15:56.955
What's with you?

1:15:57.195 --> 1:16:00.858
Politicians practice politics,
soldiers do military work,

1:16:00.892 --> 1:16:04.523
and if each side takes full
responsibility for their duties,

1:16:05.035 --> 1:16:08.093
then the nation will
surely prosper, won't it?

1:16:12.206 --> 1:16:17.801
I see our Silmido captain
is a romanticist.

1:16:18.746 --> 1:16:25.784
Or does he prefer a murderous
reunification of his own hand,

1:16:25.821 --> 1:16:29.653
as revenge for the wartime
massacre of his family?

1:16:31.690 --> 1:16:35.407
As a soldier, I have
neither learned nor taught

1:16:35.441 --> 1:16:39.125
to let personal feelings
affect one's mission.

1:16:40.565 --> 1:16:42.191
That is a relief.

1:16:43.232 --> 1:16:44.928
I'll believe in you.

1:17:03.717 --> 1:17:06.776
So you keep throwing fits
in order to see your father?

1:17:09.054 --> 1:17:12.722
- When you go to Pyongyang...
- No!

1:17:12.757 --> 1:17:15.554
I should have guessed earlier,
but I thought, "No way. "

1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:18.853
Our mission is
to kill a commie,

1:17:19.096 --> 1:17:22.326
who would have thought
we'd have a commie among us?

1:17:24.101 --> 1:17:25.624
That's not true.

1:17:26.203 --> 1:17:28.170
Or on the other hand,
this commie...

1:17:28.205 --> 1:17:30.036
I'm not a communist!

1:17:31.106 --> 1:17:34.836
Really? You're not communist?

1:17:35.309 --> 1:17:37.642
Of course you are!

1:17:38.045 --> 1:17:41.263
Someone who abandons
his wife and brat

1:17:41.300 --> 1:17:44.484
and goes up North is
a commie to the bone.

1:17:44.518 --> 1:17:45.818
If a kid raised

1:17:45.851 --> 1:17:48.718
by that bastard isn't
a commie, then who is?

1:17:48.923 --> 1:17:52.138
I know you're a commie
just by looking in your eyes.

1:17:52.172 --> 1:17:55.355
For 3 years I've been
through hell because of you.

1:17:56.393 --> 1:17:58.495
In my final year,
I keep getting beaten

1:17:58.531 --> 1:18:01.162
for your crazy glare!

1:18:01.196 --> 1:18:03.795
I'm not a commie!

1:18:03.967 --> 1:18:06.102
You're a commie, asshole.

1:18:06.137 --> 1:18:07.467
Yeah!

1:18:07.971 --> 1:18:10.204
If he weren't a commie,

1:18:10.238 --> 1:18:13.708
he couldn't leave
his wife and brat,

1:18:13.741 --> 1:18:18.046
knowing how they
would end up living here.

1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:19.982
I'll find that bastard,

1:18:20.016 --> 1:18:21.847
put a bullet in his skull,

1:18:21.881 --> 1:18:25.885
and see what commie
blood looks like.

1:18:25.918 --> 1:18:30.879
Until then, I can't die and
I can't back off. Understand?

1:18:31.123 --> 1:18:32.885
Vicious bastard.

1:18:33.991 --> 1:18:36.653
That's why I can't even die.

1:18:36.828 --> 1:18:40.819
He should have killed
me before leaving.

1:18:41.098 --> 1:18:47.035
I'll take the head of
his beloved Dear Leader

1:18:47.337 --> 1:18:52.741
and thrust it in his face.
That's why I gotta go.

1:18:52.776 --> 1:18:53.506
Got it?

1:18:53.542 --> 1:18:55.338
You goddamned fool...

1:19:08.622 --> 1:19:11.020
You goddamned fool...

1:19:26.102 --> 1:19:27.967
Forgive me!

1:19:29.138 --> 1:19:31.231
Bastard doesn't know fear!

1:19:31.442 --> 1:19:35.544
If you overlook this,
I'll do whatever you ask.

1:19:35.578 --> 1:19:38.445
I can't let it fall apart now.

1:19:38.980 --> 1:19:40.880
Please, save me!

1:19:48.488 --> 1:19:51.513
The captain told me
about your past and said,

1:19:51.824 --> 1:19:56.420
even if everyone else gives up,
you'll remain to the end.

1:19:56.795 --> 1:20:02.322
As long as my mother's alive,
I can't be free of this.

1:20:05.236 --> 1:20:12.196
Ever since he left, she
hasn't slept comfortably once.

1:20:13.043 --> 1:20:14.736
She doesn't heat the room.

1:20:15.978 --> 1:20:21.745
I was in middle school,
so it's been over ten years,

1:20:25.252 --> 1:20:29.053
she'll probably
sleep that way tonight.

1:20:30.257 --> 1:20:32.690
Curled up like a bug.

1:20:36.495 --> 1:20:42.090
She says a parent who failed
her son can't lie comfortably.

1:20:45.536 --> 1:20:49.639
If you succeed, they'll free
you of your father's crimes?

1:20:49.674 --> 1:20:51.004
Yes.

1:20:51.241 --> 1:20:52.842
The drill captain said that?

1:20:52.876 --> 1:20:54.440
Yes.

1:20:54.474 --> 1:20:56.006
Okay.

1:20:56.344 --> 1:20:58.278
I'll say I beat you,

1:20:59.114 --> 1:21:02.173
and then I fell over
and hit a rock.

1:21:21.367 --> 1:21:25.337
You asked us to send
unit 684 to Viet Nam?

1:21:25.372 --> 1:21:27.771
Send them anywhere
in the world

1:21:27.807 --> 1:21:30.068
and they will excel.

1:21:30.307 --> 1:21:34.707
They'll be a great help to our
troops in the Vietnam War.

1:21:36.912 --> 1:21:39.312
As soon as those
boys leave Silmido,

1:21:39.782 --> 1:21:41.080
the world will know

1:21:41.115 --> 1:21:44.552
of our plans
to kill Kim Il-sung.

1:21:45.319 --> 1:21:47.015
For 30 men,

1:21:47.321 --> 1:21:50.925
do we sacrifice 30 million
citizens' hopes for peace?

1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:53.224
I will ensure that everything

1:21:53.258 --> 1:21:56.193
concerning Silmido remains secret.

1:21:56.229 --> 1:21:58.564
The surest way to keep
secrets is to bury them.

1:21:58.601 --> 1:22:00.698
But we promised them...

1:22:00.734 --> 1:22:05.066
Isn't it a soldier's highest
moral duty to be obedient?

1:22:06.571 --> 1:22:11.510
The order given to you is to
completely erase unit 684.

1:22:11.544 --> 1:22:13.437
Where was this order given?

1:22:13.473 --> 1:22:15.333
It is the nation's order.

1:22:15.812 --> 1:22:18.301
Is central intelligence
the nation?

1:22:30.490 --> 1:22:34.161
Those with authority make
decisions and pass down orders.

1:22:34.196 --> 1:22:36.685
Those are the nation's orders.

1:22:37.130 --> 1:22:42.932
Now the Republic is ordering
that unit 684 be terminated.

1:22:44.903 --> 1:22:46.961
Chief, are you all right?

1:22:47.170 --> 1:22:49.401
Lead out our guest.

1:22:49.974 --> 1:22:52.498
How can I kill them
with my own hands?

1:23:04.585 --> 1:23:10.859
Sergeant Jo, Sergeant Park,
Staff Sergeants Ko and Han,

1:23:10.892 --> 1:23:15.061
and 35. young soldiers...

1:23:15.094 --> 1:23:17.997
do you wish
to sacrifice them?

1:23:18.298 --> 1:23:20.664
- What do you mean?
- I'll give you a week.

1:23:21.066 --> 1:23:26.519
After one week, we will
storm unit 684 ourselves.

1:23:26.554 --> 1:23:31.973
Everyone will be shot,
you and the soldiers included.

1:25:03.886 --> 1:25:07.284
Look at those idiots.
Did they let in another goal?

1:25:07.873 --> 1:25:11.237
Winning here doesn't get you
anything, why bother?

1:25:11.547 --> 1:25:13.983
But they run well for
people with no food.

1:25:14.017 --> 1:25:16.500
There's no beating these days,

1:25:16.534 --> 1:25:18.983
so they've got extra energy.

1:25:19.421 --> 1:25:21.386
It's so quiet,
aren't you nervous?

1:25:21.421 --> 1:25:24.879
You feel uneasy if they don't
beat you? Want me to do it?

1:25:25.126 --> 1:25:26.649
What the hell?

1:25:27.227 --> 1:25:29.821
You think we're friends now?

1:25:31.397 --> 1:25:35.629
Hey, are they
printed in America?

1:25:36.668 --> 1:25:39.536
- What?
- I know it all, you bastard.

1:25:39.572 --> 1:25:41.039
I thought I'd tell
Sergeant Dick

1:25:41.074 --> 1:25:43.139
and watch you get killed,

1:25:43.175 --> 1:25:46.905
but then they'd probably rip
it up, so I controlled myself.

1:25:47.177 --> 1:25:48.974
Let's look at it together.

1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:50.946
What are you talking about?

1:25:50.980 --> 1:25:54.143
This bastard's reading the
classics alone each night.

1:25:54.550 --> 1:25:58.212
Are they white girls
or black girls?

1:25:58.821 --> 1:26:00.755
- Really?
- No.

1:26:00.788 --> 1:26:02.154
Come on!

1:26:02.189 --> 1:26:04.053
I'm telling you the truth!

1:26:14.299 --> 1:26:16.300
Sang-pil, are you sure?

1:26:16.336 --> 1:26:18.569
They didn't let us
bring anything here.

1:26:18.604 --> 1:26:19.871
Anything's possible.

1:26:19.904 --> 1:26:22.435
In jail,
I saw a guy who lived

1:26:22.471 --> 1:26:24.968
with 20 cigarettes up his ass.

1:26:25.375 --> 1:26:27.003
Want to see?

1:26:28.178 --> 1:26:31.978
Why didn't you say earlier?

1:26:44.093 --> 1:26:45.658
What's this?

1:26:45.693 --> 1:26:47.922
That girl isn't black or white.

1:26:48.128 --> 1:26:51.131
- That's yutdong. Pink color.
- Yutdong?

1:26:51.166 --> 1:26:52.731
The name of the clothes.

1:26:52.766 --> 1:26:54.698
My mom had one just the same.

1:26:54.733 --> 1:26:58.502
When I entered middle school,
she made one and wore it.

1:26:58.539 --> 1:27:00.639
The word yutdong was so funny,

1:27:00.674 --> 1:27:03.672
we made jokes about it.

1:27:03.708 --> 1:27:06.232
My brother and I kept laughing...

1:27:15.918 --> 1:27:17.681
Hand it over

1:27:18.122 --> 1:27:19.887
Come on, hand it over!

1:27:19.922 --> 1:27:21.719
It's the last
photo of my mother.

1:27:22.091 --> 1:27:24.158
I won't take it out again.

1:27:24.193 --> 1:27:25.627
Hurry up, asshole!

1:27:25.661 --> 1:27:26.957
Stop it.

1:27:27.262 --> 1:27:28.260
Give it!

1:27:28.297 --> 1:27:30.127
It's his mother's photo.

1:27:30.998 --> 1:27:33.991
Unit 684 needs only
orders and obedience.

1:27:34.233 --> 1:27:37.400
His mother?
Who needs shit like that?

1:27:37.437 --> 1:27:40.071
What's with you? You have a
photo of your mother too.

1:27:40.108 --> 1:27:42.700
They have to
go to Pyongyang.

1:27:42.974 --> 1:27:45.290
If one of them
gets distracted,

1:27:45.326 --> 1:27:47.607
our 3 years
work will unravel.

1:27:48.013 --> 1:27:51.949
Especially him,
thinking the captain

1:27:51.984 --> 1:27:53.696
will protect him...

1:27:53.731 --> 1:27:55.406
What's going on?

1:27:57.352 --> 1:27:58.910
Loyalty!

1:28:00.623 --> 1:28:04.023
I'm disciplining team 3 captain
for carrying personal items.

1:28:04.326 --> 1:28:06.453
It's his mother's photo.

1:28:10.463 --> 1:28:11.862
He'll hand it over.

1:28:13.266 --> 1:28:14.927
Come on, man.

1:28:33.415 --> 1:28:34.850
No!

1:28:34.883 --> 1:28:36.681
- In-chan!
- No!

1:28:36.716 --> 1:28:38.478
Control yourself!

1:28:49.097 --> 1:28:50.893
Captain!

1:28:54.701 --> 1:29:00.194
If you shoot me, you can
go see your mother in person.

1:29:09.580 --> 1:29:18.044
First, I'll go to Pyongyang.

1:29:23.425 --> 1:29:27.383
KANG In-chan!
24 hours solitary confinement.

1:29:59.356 --> 1:30:00.913
Loyalty!

1:30:01.358 --> 1:30:02.585
At ease.

1:30:14.501 --> 1:30:16.526
Do you regret it?

1:30:19.603 --> 1:30:24.564
Taking my offer,
three years ago.

1:30:26.945 --> 1:30:28.912
No, sir.

1:30:29.481 --> 1:30:34.285
A lot of time you spent here
must've been worse than death.

1:30:34.320 --> 1:30:38.381
I'm paying a price to get
what I want, so no regrets.

1:30:39.022 --> 1:30:42.252
- Bring some water.
- Yes?

1:30:46.428 --> 1:30:48.896
Bring some drinking water.

1:30:50.332 --> 1:30:51.662
Yes, sir.

1:30:59.674 --> 1:31:02.608
An order has come
to terminate the unit.

1:31:04.210 --> 1:31:08.078
It says for us to
kill the boys ourselves.

1:31:10.216 --> 1:31:13.309
- Captain!
- It's an order from above.

1:31:19.489 --> 1:31:21.856
This is ridiculous!

1:31:24.794 --> 1:31:27.262
What are you doing?
Say something!

1:31:29.899 --> 1:31:32.627
What if we don't
carry out the order?

1:31:34.201 --> 1:31:38.205
Someone will come here
to do it themselves.

1:31:38.241 --> 1:31:40.228
What will happen to us?

1:31:40.674 --> 1:31:42.375
If we leave first,
then they'll terminate...

1:31:42.410 --> 1:31:44.172
What are you saying?

1:31:44.511 --> 1:31:46.605
What do you mean,
terminate?

1:31:46.946 --> 1:31:48.948
You should be saying
this can't happen,

1:31:48.981 --> 1:31:50.495
not ask who!

1:31:50.529 --> 1:31:52.009
Wait a minute!

1:31:53.152 --> 1:31:54.919
What the hell
are you thinking?

1:31:54.954 --> 1:31:56.652
Quiet!

1:31:56.687 --> 1:31:58.688
If the order is irreversible,

1:31:58.722 --> 1:32:00.858
we should obviously
ensure our safety.

1:32:00.892 --> 1:32:04.587
Obviously? What's obvious?

1:32:05.694 --> 1:32:08.863
Will there be consequences
if we disobey?

1:32:08.899 --> 1:32:11.525
Then we'll be eliminated too.

1:32:12.400 --> 1:32:15.097
If we don't
carry out the order,

1:32:15.370 --> 1:32:18.771
they'll assume we
sympathize with the soldiers,

1:32:18.806 --> 1:32:24.011
and concluding that we can't
be trusted to keep this secret,

1:32:24.045 --> 1:32:26.978
they'll kill us as well.

1:32:27.013 --> 1:32:31.349
This is absurd.
None of this makes sense!

1:32:31.385 --> 1:32:33.318
Why just kill such
competent men?

1:32:33.350 --> 1:32:35.875
- Does that make sense?
- Because they're competent.

1:32:36.755 --> 1:32:37.955
Killing them is safer.

1:32:37.990 --> 1:32:39.889
You asshole!

1:32:40.122 --> 1:32:44.060
Why do you keep taking
the higher-ups' side?

1:32:44.096 --> 1:32:46.430
How much time do we have?

1:32:46.465 --> 1:32:48.764
- Hey!
- Five days remain.

1:32:48.799 --> 1:32:50.183
Can we use any method?

1:32:50.218 --> 1:32:51.566
You son of a bitch!

1:32:51.603 --> 1:32:53.263
Sergeant Jo!

1:32:55.437 --> 1:32:57.096
You...

1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:01.535
Do you really have to...

1:33:03.375 --> 1:33:04.975
Those pathetic bastards...

1:33:05.011 --> 1:33:07.638
We can't die with them
just because they're pathetic.

1:33:08.815 --> 1:33:13.079
Would you choose them
over your mother?

1:33:13.686 --> 1:33:16.653
You want me to die,

1:33:16.687 --> 1:33:19.521
a month before
my kid is born?

1:33:20.158 --> 1:33:22.523
Even still, you bastard...

1:33:25.897 --> 1:33:28.329
Even still, you bastard!

1:33:35.337 --> 1:33:37.703
You dirty bastard.

1:33:51.551 --> 1:33:53.279
Forgive me.

1:33:58.289 --> 1:34:00.587
About the methods...

1:34:03.327 --> 1:34:08.319
I'm leaving it up
to the two of you.

1:34:08.931 --> 1:34:13.527
Whether you follow
the order or disobey it...

1:34:14.670 --> 1:34:16.103
Yes, sir.

1:35:01.142 --> 1:35:02.871
What are you doing?

1:35:05.112 --> 1:35:07.671
What? Is something wrong?

1:35:10.282 --> 1:35:12.113
No.

1:35:12.518 --> 1:35:17.722
These days, I almost feel
like settling down here.

1:35:17.758 --> 1:35:19.212
Sang-pil!

1:35:39.973 --> 1:35:41.839
Sergeant Jo!

1:35:43.544 --> 1:35:45.239
Don't be like this.

1:35:46.647 --> 1:35:48.706
It's an order, after all.

1:35:50.150 --> 1:35:51.815
An order?

1:35:51.852 --> 1:35:53.318
Were you
so nice to them

1:35:53.353 --> 1:35:56.685
all this time
only to do this?

1:35:56.988 --> 1:35:58.855
You coward.

1:35:58.890 --> 1:36:02.659
Then what can
you do about it?

1:36:02.693 --> 1:36:04.854
If you're so brave,
what will you do?

1:36:08.098 --> 1:36:10.066
Don't say another word.

1:36:10.100 --> 1:36:13.297
If you challenge me
again, I'll kill you.

1:36:21.609 --> 1:36:23.907
<i>Our creed</i>

1:36:26.547 --> 1:36:28.513
Can you do it
without Sergeant Jo?

1:36:28.548 --> 1:36:30.883
At this stage,
it's better without him.

1:36:30.918 --> 1:36:32.550
I'll take responsibility.

1:36:32.586 --> 1:36:35.389
Just send Sergeant Jo
to the mainland, please.

1:36:35.424 --> 1:36:38.515
If I send him under
these circumstances

1:36:38.823 --> 1:36:40.589
will he just go?

1:36:40.625 --> 1:36:43.628
Send him to argue once more
on the soldiers' behalf.

1:36:43.664 --> 1:36:47.393
He won't refuse such an order.

1:37:00.243 --> 1:37:02.039
Did you see a ghost?

1:37:04.579 --> 1:37:07.876
Hey...
you'll hurt someone!

1:37:09.516 --> 1:37:12.006
What's wrong, are you sick?

1:37:13.218 --> 1:37:16.287
It looks like
the heat got to him.

1:37:16.324 --> 1:37:17.988
Last night he saw spirits.

1:37:18.024 --> 1:37:21.427
He screamed out so loud,
woke us all up.

1:37:21.461 --> 1:37:22.828
Go take a rest.

1:37:22.862 --> 1:37:24.527
Thank you.

1:37:24.562 --> 1:37:26.656
Let's go. Come on.

1:37:30.801 --> 1:37:32.202
Have a good trip.

1:37:32.236 --> 1:37:33.693
Loyalty!

1:37:44.813 --> 1:37:47.716
What does it mean
if Sergeant Jo's leaving?

1:37:47.750 --> 1:37:51.116
That tonight they'll
wipe us all out?

1:38:02.160 --> 1:38:03.752
Loyalty!

1:38:09.834 --> 1:38:11.631
Sergeant Jo!

1:38:14.537 --> 1:38:15.637
What?

1:38:15.673 --> 1:38:17.072
Going on vacation?

1:38:17.107 --> 1:38:20.235
You think I'm so fortunate?
I'm on business.

1:38:20.542 --> 1:38:23.635
You'll be back today?

1:38:23.878 --> 1:38:25.847
What's with you guys?

1:38:27.448 --> 1:38:29.783
The boys were hoping you'd

1:38:29.819 --> 1:38:32.120
bring back something sweet.

1:38:32.155 --> 1:38:34.213
Don't worry about it.

1:38:34.855 --> 1:38:36.188
All right.

1:38:36.223 --> 1:38:39.192
I'll bring you back
something by tomorrow night.

1:38:39.226 --> 1:38:41.157
Attention!

1:38:43.229 --> 1:38:44.893
Salute!

1:38:44.926 --> 1:38:46.556
Loyalty!

1:39:25.164 --> 1:39:29.567
You know these soldiers'
abilities better than anyone.

1:39:29.867 --> 1:39:32.836
In order to avoid
a terrible slaughter,

1:39:33.105 --> 1:39:36.267
not one of them
should be left by daybreak.

1:40:13.671 --> 1:40:15.606
Go out quietly, in one line.

1:40:15.641 --> 1:40:17.506
Do we wipe them all out?

1:40:17.540 --> 1:40:21.009
Once it starts, it's
a fight for our lives.

1:40:21.045 --> 1:40:23.978
They started this.

1:40:24.013 --> 1:40:26.480
We can't afford to
feel guilty.

1:40:26.516 --> 1:40:30.219
If we can't finish in 20 min.
Our chances are slim.

1:40:30.254 --> 1:40:31.914
Switch with me.

1:40:32.153 --> 1:40:34.383
I can't do the
communication barracks.

1:40:34.622 --> 1:40:40.685
Park was going on holiday
in a week, he was so excited.

1:40:41.862 --> 1:40:44.063
Don't pretend you're the
only one feeling bad.

1:40:44.098 --> 1:40:45.583
Does anyone here want

1:40:45.616 --> 1:40:47.030
to kill their superior?

1:40:47.065 --> 1:40:49.635
But your guy is new, you
can't be that close to him.

1:40:49.669 --> 1:40:52.569
You bastards!

1:41:01.945 --> 1:41:03.740
It's time.

1:41:04.715 --> 1:41:06.849
We're supposed to take
our counterpart?

1:41:06.883 --> 1:41:09.434
That seems a bit risky.

1:41:09.470 --> 1:41:11.894
Is this the only way?

1:41:11.929 --> 1:41:14.318
What if someone else...

1:41:31.502 --> 1:41:33.969
- Control yourself, Sergeant!
- Stop it!

1:41:34.004 --> 1:41:36.436
What are you doing?
This isn't like you!

1:41:38.874 --> 1:41:41.010
What isn't like me?

1:41:41.047 --> 1:41:44.845
You shitheads!

1:41:47.383 --> 1:41:54.289
Kill them...
If you don't,

1:41:54.789 --> 1:41:56.780
then we're all dead.

1:41:58.192 --> 1:41:59.818
Got it?

1:42:26.617 --> 1:42:28.981
Don't make that face, huh?

1:42:34.022 --> 1:42:38.360
Go quickly now and contact
the soldiers on guard duty,

1:42:38.394 --> 1:42:41.226
so they are informed
of our plans.

1:43:18.561 --> 1:43:23.154
The operation begins
in 30 minutes.

1:43:29.869 --> 1:43:31.003
In position, all of you!

1:43:31.040 --> 1:43:32.437
In position!

1:43:36.208 --> 1:43:38.107
You assholes!

1:45:19.595 --> 1:45:22.825
You could have just sent us.

1:45:24.598 --> 1:45:28.585
My mission was to
kill you, not send you.

1:45:28.620 --> 1:45:32.571
Your mission was to
send us to Pyongyang.

1:45:32.606 --> 1:45:35.475
My mission was
not only to make

1:45:35.510 --> 1:45:39.274
unit 684 the greatest unit,

1:45:39.611 --> 1:45:43.307
but to respond at once
to the nation's call.

1:45:44.149 --> 1:45:48.251
The nation has ordered me
to dissolve unit 684.

1:45:48.286 --> 1:45:52.686
Now, my mission is to kill you.

1:45:52.722 --> 1:45:54.521
Then you should've
done it properly.

1:45:54.557 --> 1:45:58.194
Why did you set me up
to listen outside the door?

1:45:58.228 --> 1:46:00.660
Knowing all this
would happen!

1:46:04.664 --> 1:46:08.031
Now all your
subordinates will die.

1:46:08.669 --> 1:46:12.973
As soldiers, they may die
in carrying out their mission.

1:46:13.008 --> 1:46:16.540
But my sense of duty won't

1:46:16.575 --> 1:46:19.478
let me break
my promise to you.

1:46:19.512 --> 1:46:22.311
That's a cowardly excuse!

1:46:24.882 --> 1:46:29.019
Yes, so I let my
subordinates choose.

1:46:29.054 --> 1:46:31.748
I'm an incompetent coward.

1:46:35.791 --> 1:46:38.021
Shoot me before leaving.

1:46:38.928 --> 1:46:41.691
Or I'll have no choice
but to kill you.

1:47:47.852 --> 1:47:50.183
I'm sorry. Shit!

1:49:06.619 --> 1:49:08.050
Over there!

1:49:17.326 --> 1:49:18.884
Don't shoot!

1:49:29.570 --> 1:49:31.367
Don't come any closer!

1:49:36.209 --> 1:49:39.077
And you were the
first one to betray us!

1:49:39.112 --> 1:49:42.682
Even that mean bastard
Sergeant Dick was against it.

1:49:42.718 --> 1:49:44.775
You were all doomed anyway!

1:49:44.984 --> 1:49:46.651
You were gonna
die either way,

1:49:46.687 --> 1:49:48.318
why should we die too?

1:49:48.353 --> 1:49:50.854
Why were we gonna die anyway?

1:49:50.889 --> 1:49:55.592
After you came, they
destroyed your national IDs.

1:49:55.627 --> 1:49:57.226
You know what that means?

1:49:57.261 --> 1:50:00.360
You're just ghosts,
roped in on this island.

1:50:00.396 --> 1:50:03.266
Whether successful or not,
you were as good as buried...

1:50:03.300 --> 1:50:05.335
Don't lie, you asshole!

1:50:05.369 --> 1:50:07.359
He's not lying.

1:50:07.902 --> 1:50:10.604
But if you tell us
there was no other way,

1:50:10.639 --> 1:50:13.639
then it's no different
when we take aim at you.

1:50:13.675 --> 1:50:18.045
If you'd tried to find another
way, if you'd thought...

1:50:18.079 --> 1:50:19.829
even once that
our cursed lives

1:50:19.865 --> 1:50:21.591
are worth as much as yours...

1:50:21.625 --> 1:50:24.037
What do you mean, the same?

1:50:24.073 --> 1:50:26.643
You're all convicted criminals!

1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:29.215
How can a bunch of nameless...

1:50:39.329 --> 1:50:41.126
What I mean is...

1:50:43.367 --> 1:50:44.765
We...

1:50:57.745 --> 1:50:59.939
Why am I nameless?

1:51:00.146 --> 1:51:02.376
I'm HAN Sang-pil!

1:51:02.881 --> 1:51:06.682
HAN Sang-pil,
you fuckers!

1:51:15.826 --> 1:51:19.896
Was that their plan
from the beginning?

1:51:19.931 --> 1:51:21.829
Was it?

1:51:21.865 --> 1:51:24.449
To use us and then get rid

1:51:24.483 --> 1:51:27.032
of us with nobody knowing?

1:51:34.175 --> 1:51:37.613
Even if we killed
Kim Il-sung now,

1:51:37.647 --> 1:51:40.160
we'd still end up dead men.

1:51:40.196 --> 1:51:42.676
We're better off dying.

1:51:42.916 --> 1:51:48.376
But I won't even get my
name on my gravestone.

1:51:48.721 --> 1:51:50.518
Shit.

1:51:50.990 --> 1:51:54.221
I thought they'd bury us
in the National Cemetery.

1:51:56.729 --> 1:52:01.323
I was going to be the
first success in my family.

1:52:01.598 --> 1:52:05.864
If you're in Korea's best
special unit, you're a success.

1:52:06.170 --> 1:52:09.803
Best? Who will ever know?

1:52:09.838 --> 1:52:14.543
Those sons of bitches who
kill us and erase our past?

1:52:14.579 --> 1:52:19.139
We can go and
make sure that people know.

1:52:42.199 --> 1:52:43.899
Beak 501, Beak 501.

1:52:43.934 --> 1:52:46.637
DPS 351 confirm training, over.

1:52:46.670 --> 1:52:48.436
What? There's no training!

1:52:48.471 --> 1:52:50.674
- They're moving, report.
- How many of them?

1:52:50.709 --> 1:52:53.539
About 20. All armed.

1:53:15.661 --> 1:53:17.160
Even without all of you,

1:53:17.193 --> 1:53:19.664
I can tell them
all we want to say,

1:53:19.698 --> 1:53:21.530
so go wherever you like.

1:53:21.564 --> 1:53:24.467
We won't stop you.
Go if you want.

1:53:24.501 --> 1:53:27.537
If I don't see the bastards
who did this to us,

1:53:27.572 --> 1:53:30.506
it'll drive me crazy inside.

1:53:31.974 --> 1:53:35.306
If Geun-je had lived,
what would he say?

1:53:36.178 --> 1:53:38.477
"Nowhere to go,

1:53:38.513 --> 1:53:42.005
and nothing to do
once I get there. "

1:53:50.156 --> 1:53:52.020
It's time.

1:54:11.574 --> 1:54:14.858
The Blue House,
don't take any detours.

1:54:14.893 --> 1:54:18.141
We need to talk to
the president, okay?

1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:35.891
Don't cry, baby. Please!

1:54:36.228 --> 1:54:39.496
Lady, all kids cry.

1:54:39.530 --> 1:54:41.828
That's how they grow up.

1:54:43.401 --> 1:54:45.334
Yes, sir.

1:54:47.070 --> 1:54:49.838
There's no need
to be scared of us.

1:54:49.873 --> 1:54:52.242
We're just on our way
to the President's House,

1:54:52.277 --> 1:54:54.540
and we had no money,

1:54:54.577 --> 1:54:56.807
so we borrowed this bus.

1:54:57.146 --> 1:55:00.014
So you'll let us live?

1:55:00.050 --> 1:55:02.985
Don't worry. Why kill
someone for no reason?

1:55:03.019 --> 1:55:05.017
<i>Here is some breaking news...</i>

1:55:05.053 --> 1:55:08.955
<i>20 armed Northern guerillas
have landed via Incheon</i>

1:55:08.991 --> 1:55:12.322
<i>and are traveling
along Kyung-in Road.</i>

1:55:12.557 --> 1:55:17.093
<i>Heavily armed, they could
be a threat to bystanders.</i>

1:55:17.128 --> 1:55:21.565
<i>Citizens are advised to take
extra-special precautions.</i>

1:55:21.601 --> 1:55:24.335
<i>If those traveling on Kyung-in
Road see suspicious soldiers...</i>

1:55:24.371 --> 1:55:26.326
Armed communists?

1:55:28.373 --> 1:55:30.606
They're calling us
armed communists?

1:55:30.640 --> 1:55:34.474
Do they order armed
communists to kill Kim Il-sung?

1:55:41.682 --> 1:55:44.150
Those bastards!

1:55:46.086 --> 1:55:47.918
There's nothing behind us.

1:55:48.622 --> 1:55:50.215
Drive straight ahead.

1:55:50.424 --> 1:55:51.822
Straight ahead?

1:55:54.393 --> 1:55:55.985
Step on it!

1:55:57.896 --> 1:55:59.261
Step on it!

1:56:08.974 --> 1:56:10.405
Prepare to fire.

1:57:02.084 --> 1:57:03.379
Chan-seok!

1:57:03.651 --> 1:57:05.175
Chan-seok!

1:57:09.022 --> 1:57:11.081
They're not communists!

1:57:12.159 --> 1:57:14.393
Why are you saying that?

1:57:14.428 --> 1:57:17.430
They're unit 684 of
the Republic of Korea!

1:57:17.467 --> 1:57:18.897
Chan-seok!

1:57:24.702 --> 1:57:28.969
How can they
call us communists?

1:57:29.606 --> 1:57:32.006
Stay awake!

1:57:33.644 --> 1:57:37.773
If we learn tactics
on a deserted island,

1:57:40.449 --> 1:57:43.748
and suddenly appear
in stolen uniforms,

1:57:44.020 --> 1:57:46.886
we must look like
communist guerrilas.

1:57:48.022 --> 1:57:50.081
Open your eyes!

1:57:55.830 --> 1:58:01.892
I can't even remember
the national anthem.

1:58:04.569 --> 1:58:15.246
<i>Soldiers' corpses are wrapped
in a bloody people's flag.</i>

1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:20.382
<i>Before the bodies
turn cold and stiff,</i>

1:58:20.419 --> 1:58:25.486
<i>the blood
stains the flag red.</i>

1:58:25.521 --> 1:58:30.357
<i>Raise it to the sky,
the red-stained bloody flag</i>

1:58:30.393 --> 1:58:33.460
<i>and beneath it,
make a solemn vow.</i>

1:58:33.495 --> 1:58:35.527
Chan-seok!

1:58:35.562 --> 1:58:40.064
<i>Cowards can leave,
if they wish to go.</i>

1:58:40.101 --> 1:58:44.570
<i>We will remain
to protect our flag.</i>

1:58:44.604 --> 1:58:46.369
It's nothing to cry about!

1:58:46.404 --> 1:58:48.371
He's just going
a little sooner.

1:58:48.707 --> 1:58:51.504
The same will
happen to all us.

1:58:52.811 --> 1:58:54.674
Young men!

1:58:55.512 --> 1:58:58.483
You sing strange songs,
and fight with our soldiers.

1:58:58.516 --> 1:59:03.975
If you aren't communists,
then what are you?

1:59:04.219 --> 1:59:06.822
Risk your lives for
our nation and people,

1:59:06.856 --> 1:59:10.224
to kill Kim Il-sung.

1:59:10.558 --> 1:59:12.891
That is your mission.

1:59:23.601 --> 1:59:26.730
We can't hold up
any longer, chief.

1:59:27.005 --> 1:59:30.140
Each region's
soldiers and policemen

1:59:30.175 --> 1:59:32.944
have installed barricades,
but each one has fallen.

1:59:32.979 --> 1:59:36.479
Now they have
just entered Seoul.

1:59:36.512 --> 1:59:41.506
Gunfights are occurring, and
the President is very uneasy.

1:59:42.686 --> 1:59:44.520
Just give the order.

1:59:44.554 --> 1:59:47.556
The army is prepared
and standing by.

1:59:47.590 --> 1:59:50.224
Now even you are in a panic.

1:59:50.258 --> 1:59:54.342
If the situation blows up,
it will be a huge problem.

1:59:54.377 --> 1:59:58.428
You need to let the fire burn
to get the hidden mice.

1:59:58.731 --> 2:00:00.565
Now that it's
reached this stage,

2:00:00.601 --> 2:00:03.485
the air force won't be able
to deny responsibility.

2:00:03.522 --> 2:00:06.372
All those people who
praised Chief Kim's policy...

2:00:06.407 --> 2:00:09.636
They'll have to
run and hide, no?

2:00:10.309 --> 2:00:13.505
Now you can start.
Go ahead.

2:00:15.112 --> 2:00:18.774
One, two, one...

2:00:54.011 --> 2:00:55.445
What do we do?

2:00:56.013 --> 2:00:57.114
Step on it.

2:00:57.148 --> 2:00:58.183
Stop the bus.

2:00:58.217 --> 2:00:59.217
Step on it!

2:00:59.250 --> 2:01:00.844
Stop!

2:01:12.428 --> 2:01:14.588
But there are still civilians...

2:01:16.764 --> 2:01:18.459
Yes, sir.

2:01:18.699 --> 2:01:22.103
Determine the civilians'
location and ready the snipers.

2:01:22.137 --> 2:01:23.295
Yes, sir.

2:01:41.819 --> 2:01:44.945
What's wrong?
Are you scared?

2:01:50.527 --> 2:01:52.117
Sang-pil.

2:01:54.161 --> 2:01:56.427
Take everyone out.

2:01:59.199 --> 2:02:02.031
If you say the
crazy son of a commie

2:02:02.803 --> 2:02:06.430
was threatening to blow up
everyone with a grenade,

2:02:06.674 --> 2:02:08.241
so you couldn't help
but come along...

2:02:08.276 --> 2:02:09.469
Hey!

2:02:13.545 --> 2:02:16.640
Shithead, there you go again.

2:02:18.849 --> 2:02:22.687
Won-sang, lead everyone out.

2:02:22.721 --> 2:02:24.153
You want us to leave?

2:02:24.187 --> 2:02:26.315
Those bastards
have brains, too.

2:02:26.557 --> 2:02:27.888
Think they'll believe

2:02:27.924 --> 2:02:31.121
we got dragged here
by one lunatic?

2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:33.025
You need two lunatics.

2:02:33.059 --> 2:02:34.690
- Sang-pil!
- Shut up!

2:02:34.997 --> 2:02:38.799
I'm not going to watch you
be some damned hero.

2:02:38.835 --> 2:02:42.503
You couldn't drag me here.

2:02:42.538 --> 2:02:44.571
I came myself.

2:02:44.607 --> 2:02:46.571
You shut up too.

2:02:46.607 --> 2:02:49.273
What did we come here for?

2:02:49.308 --> 2:02:52.877
Other people can leave,
but I'm staying!

2:02:52.913 --> 2:02:56.414
Three lunatics
seem better than two.

2:02:56.448 --> 2:02:58.732
You think you're still
team captain here?

2:02:58.768 --> 2:03:01.019
Once a captain,
always a captain, bastard.

2:03:01.055 --> 2:03:01.953
Sure.

2:03:01.985 --> 2:03:04.286
Once an underling,
always an underling.

2:03:04.320 --> 2:03:08.382
Think you can toss us out
and play heroes yourself?

2:03:12.295 --> 2:03:13.727
Hey!

2:03:15.764 --> 2:03:19.995
What would we do if we
hadn't met those bastards?

2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:22.399
They're up to something
behind us!

2:03:33.946 --> 2:03:35.244
Are you okay?

2:03:35.381 --> 2:03:36.474
I'm okay!

2:04:18.549 --> 2:04:21.097
Stop, you bastards!

2:04:21.132 --> 2:04:23.645
There are civilians...

2:04:27.223 --> 2:04:29.088
Hold your fire!

2:04:30.193 --> 2:04:33.128
That's enough. The civilians
are by the window.

2:04:33.163 --> 2:04:34.562
Commander!

2:04:48.341 --> 2:04:51.845
Yes, sir. In 5 minutes,
we open full fire.

2:04:51.880 --> 2:04:52.695
The civilians...

2:04:52.731 --> 2:04:53.477
Forget them!

2:04:53.513 --> 2:04:54.648
Bystanders are watching us.

2:04:54.681 --> 2:04:56.206
That's an order!

2:04:57.283 --> 2:04:59.317
Loyalty! I'll go talk to them.

2:04:59.352 --> 2:05:00.518
Who the hell are you?

2:05:00.553 --> 2:05:02.955
The men in the bus
are my subordinates.

2:05:02.989 --> 2:05:03.788
Take him away!

2:05:03.821 --> 2:05:05.073
They're not communists!

2:05:05.107 --> 2:05:06.323
I can persuade them.

2:05:06.358 --> 2:05:07.380
Get out!

2:05:07.591 --> 2:05:08.590
Let go!

2:05:08.625 --> 2:05:11.593
- Get out!
- Let go of me, bastards!

2:05:39.284 --> 2:05:40.783
Are you okay?

2:05:40.818 --> 2:05:43.515
Hell, yeah. This is nothing.

2:05:44.790 --> 2:05:46.847
Shit.

2:05:52.194 --> 2:05:54.593
I forgot to give this to you...

2:05:56.531 --> 2:05:59.969
I couldn't find
a few pieces. Shit.

2:06:00.003 --> 2:06:03.271
But the skirt is all there.

2:06:03.307 --> 2:06:04.828
The yutdong!

2:06:05.306 --> 2:06:10.038
Sgt. Dick, the mean bastard,
ripped it into such tiny pieces.

2:06:11.678 --> 2:06:13.346
But I'm relieved
that at least one

2:06:13.383 --> 2:06:16.379
mean bastard got out.

2:06:16.415 --> 2:06:18.576
Sergeant Ko probably lived too!

2:06:20.519 --> 2:06:21.719
What?

2:06:21.754 --> 2:06:25.924
I probably saved one too.
He was a bit beat up, though.

2:06:25.959 --> 2:06:29.518
Why can't you obey orders, huh?

2:06:30.961 --> 2:06:33.155
We're all going to die anyway.

2:06:33.531 --> 2:06:37.192
The newspapers will write
about 19 dead communists.

2:06:50.345 --> 2:06:55.473
That'll be funny.
Fat communist 1.

2:06:57.851 --> 2:07:00.375
Short-legged communist 2.

2:07:02.520 --> 2:07:05.387
Constantly-eating communist 3.

2:07:08.359 --> 2:07:11.919
Hairless left armpit
communist 4.

2:07:16.232 --> 2:07:20.396
CHOl Jang-su, whose
name means "long life".

2:07:25.507 --> 2:07:27.098
KIM Deok-young

2:07:29.711 --> 2:07:31.337
CHOl Soo-young

2:07:34.581 --> 2:07:35.947
KIM Ki-hwan

2:07:39.619 --> 2:07:41.018
YOO Jae-seung

2:07:44.489 --> 2:07:45.820
LEE Sung-min

2:07:50.261 --> 2:07:51.751
LEE Min-ho.

2:08:18.685 --> 2:08:20.777
Your name's missing.

2:09:05.823 --> 2:09:07.485
Will this do?

2:09:11.263 --> 2:09:12.990
Sure.

2:09:17.100 --> 2:09:19.134
Hurry up and get out!

2:09:19.170 --> 2:09:22.695
Hurry, if you
don't want to die!

2:09:26.574 --> 2:09:28.236
General.

2:09:36.617 --> 2:09:37.709
Ready?

2:09:38.152 --> 2:09:40.277
Yes, ready!

2:09:42.522 --> 2:09:43.539
Ready?

2:09:43.574 --> 2:09:44.981
Yes!

2:09:45.016 --> 2:09:46.388
Ready!

2:09:47.859 --> 2:09:50.305
Are you ready?

2:09:50.341 --> 2:09:52.753
Yes, we're ready!
