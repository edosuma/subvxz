WEBVTT

00:03.925 --> 00:05.488
Daddy?
Daughter?

00:05.488 --> 00:08.626
I'm going to start a magazine-
"Hot flash."

00:08.676 --> 00:10.863
If i can't marry
into the meade family,

00:10.863 --> 00:12.974
I will give birth
to an heir.

00:12.999 --> 00:15.363
We need to find
a surrogate we can control.

00:15.430 --> 00:19.197
Do we feel pregnant yet? How
long am i trapped here for?

00:19.263 --> 00:21.030
I'm renee.
I'm daniel.

00:21.096 --> 00:22.996
Meade. I know.

00:23.063 --> 00:24.996
I see you've met
my sister.

00:25.063 --> 00:28.497
You think it's too early to start planning
family vacations? You're a fool, daniel.

00:28.564 --> 00:30.729
You have no idea what
you're getting yourself into.

00:30.796 --> 00:33.430
You just really seemed to up
your game when betty showed up.

00:33.497 --> 00:35.896
What? I don't think i'm
the suarez sister you like.

00:35.963 --> 00:38.297
Tell me who you're dating.
Henry from accounting. There.

00:38.363 --> 00:40.297
More.
He got charlie pregnant.

00:40.363 --> 00:41.925
I know you're leaving
in five months,

00:41.925 --> 00:44.394
And i know that
i'm gonna get my heart broken,

00:44.394 --> 00:45.816
But maybe it's worth it.

Good morning.

There she is...
good morning.

02:25.930 --> 02:27.729
The birthday girl.

02:27.796 --> 02:29.863
<i>Feliz cumpleaños, mi amor.</i>

02:29.930 --> 02:30.925
<i>Thank you, papi.</i>

02:30.925 --> 02:35.130
<i>Happy birthday, chica.
Oh, i got something for you.</i>

02:36.630 --> 02:38.175
What? You want 23 more?

02:38.672 --> 02:41.896
<i>Love the bag, aunt betty.
Vuitton?</i>

02:41.963 --> 02:43.613
No, it's a fake.
I got it from some guy

02:43.613 --> 02:46.878
Selling off a blanket on 6th avenue.
You know, you make it really hard for me

02:46.878 --> 02:51.163
To live vicariously through you. So i know
you didn't want anything special this year,

02:51.230 --> 02:53.630
But maybe before you head off
for the poconos,

02:53.696 --> 02:55.597
Some birthday pancakes?

02:55.664 --> 02:57.564
<i>Daddy, i love
your birthday breakfasts,</i>

02:57.630 --> 03:00.050
But henry and i want
to get an early start.

03:00.050 --> 03:03.729
Well, i hope you and henry
have a wonderful weekend. Mm.

03:03.796 --> 03:06.397
And, uh, don't forget
your cupcakes. Oh, i won't.

03:06.463 --> 03:10.128
It was nice of daniel to give you the
day off. I know. He was great about it,

03:10.128 --> 03:11.363
Except he says
now i owe him one.

03:11.430 --> 03:12.675
Someone has a short memory.

03:12.675 --> 03:15.397
<i>Okay, i know you told us
not to, but...</i>

03:17.930 --> 03:20.430
Aah! A cell phone!

03:20.497 --> 03:21.896
Justin, this is-

03:21.963 --> 03:23.896
<i>Wait,
is this my cell phone?</i>

03:23.963 --> 03:25.487
Turn it over.

03:28.297 --> 03:30.564
Aah! I love it.

03:30.630 --> 03:31.597
Fierce, huh?

03:31.664 --> 03:34.330
Very.
Don't do that.

03:34.397 --> 03:35.796
No?
No.

03:35.863 --> 03:37.297
No.
No.

03:37.363 --> 03:40.230
Okay. Uh, guys, i love you.
I'll see you sunday night.

03:40.297 --> 03:42.729
I'm so excited.
Love you.

03:42.796 --> 03:43.940
Love you, too.

03:44.930 --> 03:48.829
Aw, they are gonna have
such a good time this weekend.

03:50.430 --> 03:51.796
<i>Papi, what's wrong?</i>

03:51.863 --> 03:53.930
She forgot the cupcakes.

03:55.564 --> 03:56.706
Just a minute.

03:58.690 --> 04:01.863
Did you shave your arms?
They look bigger.

04:03.763 --> 04:05.963
Daniel, i know
we've had our issues...

04:06.030 --> 04:08.963
You tried to ruin
my magazine, destroy my family,

04:09.030 --> 04:11.930
Marry my father on his deathbed
- Some bigger than others,

04:11.996 --> 04:14.063
But i never personally
wish you any harm.

04:14.130 --> 04:16.430
That's why i'm here
to warn you about renee.

04:16.497 --> 04:18.430
Renee has
a history with men.

04:18.497 --> 04:21.529
She becomeneedy,
erratic, obsessive.

04:21.596 --> 04:24.397
It probably has something to do
with daddy withholding affection

04:24.463 --> 04:26.263
While we were growing up.

04:26.330 --> 04:28.729
I mean, i've dealt with it well,
but renee on the other hand-

04:28.796 --> 04:31.197
Stop. You don't
have to say anymore.

04:31.263 --> 04:32.972
I don't believe anything
you have to say.

04:35.237 --> 04:37.597
Stony brook.

04:39.125 --> 04:40.050
What?

04:40.050 --> 04:43.397
Ask my sister
about stony brook

04:43.463 --> 04:46.363
If you really want
to get to know her.

04:49.687 --> 04:53.030
How was i? Excellent.
Sincere, but not condescending,

04:53.096 --> 04:55.030
Just the right dash
of menace

04:55.096 --> 04:57.030
And your breasts,
of course, look amazing.

04:57.096 --> 04:59.729
You've gotten under
his pasty, hairless skin, woman.

04:59.796 --> 05:01.696
Well, i better.
Renee's a loose cannon.

05:01.763 --> 05:04.729
I can't have that,
not with what i have planned.

05:04.796 --> 05:09.096
Oh, god,
this bloody window.

05:09.163 --> 05:12.397
Oh, is a nice breeze
too much to ask for?

05:12.463 --> 05:14.996
I bet my sister
had it bolted shut.

05:15.096 --> 05:17.297
Evil robots
don't need oxygen.

05:17.363 --> 05:18.425
Oh.
Let me help you.

05:18.425 --> 05:21.263
Oh, go on, please. Ohh.

05:21.330 --> 05:25.763
Ooh. This should freshen
things up a wee bit.

05:29.930 --> 05:33.497
<i>No candles... ever.</i>

05:35.440 --> 05:36.237
Okay.

05:38.197 --> 05:40.096
Christina, okay, wait.

05:40.163 --> 05:41.550
Repeat, please,

05:41.550 --> 05:43.564
And try to enunciate.

05:43.630 --> 05:46.497
I'm sayin' there's something
goin' on with her,

05:46.564 --> 05:49.597
And i am going to
find out what it is.

05:49.664 --> 05:50.425
With who?

05:50.425 --> 05:52.863
Wilhelmi's sister-Renee.

05:52.930 --> 05:54.397
<i>She's strange.</i>

05:54.463 --> 05:56.530
Like, just now.
Like, listen,

05:56.597 --> 05:58.362
I tried to light
a candle...

05:58.362 --> 06:01.238
And she totally freaked
out. What? A-A candy?

06:01.238 --> 06:02.999
What type of candy?
Why were you lighting it?

06:02.999 --> 06:05.430
A candle.

06:05.497 --> 06:08.930
I can't hear you. Justin
bedazzled my cell phone...

06:08.996 --> 06:11.896
And i think there's glue
in the circuitry.

06:12.612 --> 06:15.030
I know.
It's a mystery...

06:15.096 --> 06:18.863
But i'm gonna find out.
Okay, i'll talk to you later.

06:22.096 --> 06:24.297
* happy birthday to me *

06:25.440 --> 06:26.030
Henry!

06:26.096 --> 06:28.230
* birthday girl in the house *

06:28.297 --> 06:32.197
I'm ready to get in the car,
go on our adventure!

06:32.263 --> 06:35.330
I love adventures.
Where are we going?

06:35.397 --> 06:37.030
Charlie.

06:51.123 --> 06:54.987
Charlie. I-I didn't even know
you were in town.

06:54.987 --> 06:56.550
Well, you know, i've been
trying for months to get

06:56.550 --> 06:58.691
Into this parenting seminar
with harvey karp.

06:58.691 --> 07:00.766
<i>He's, like,
this amazing baby doctor.</i>

07:00.766 --> 07:02.424
He's, like, a baby guru genius. Betty.

07:02.948 --> 07:04.616
Anyway, so i get
a phone call yesterday,

07:04.716 --> 07:09.262
And they have an opening in a seminar
this weekend, so... this weekend?

07:09.671 --> 07:11.759
C- Can you
just give us a minute?

07:12.191 --> 07:15.333
Oh, right.
Yeah, yeah, of course. Sure.

07:16.038 --> 07:18.753
Baby kicked.
Baby kicked.

07:18.753 --> 07:21.404
<i>He's so excited
to see his daddy.</i>

07:23.925 --> 07:26.738
Betty, listen,
she just showed up.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.738
I already told her she can go
to that seminar without me.

07:28.738 --> 07:33.105
We can still go away.
No, no, no, henry.

07:33.172 --> 07:35.071
What-What are you
supposed to do?

07:35.138 --> 07:36.571
It's for the baby.

07:36.638 --> 07:37.925
But it's
your birthday weekend.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.879
I know. I know, but-But maybe
we don't have to go away.

07:40.879 --> 07:44.999
We could just celebrate
here in new york.

07:44.999 --> 07:45.999
It's new york.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.538
There's restaurants
and nightclubs,

07:48.604 --> 07:52.038
And i will organize the ultimate
birthday extravaganza,

07:52.105 --> 07:55.005
To which you are invited.

07:55.071 --> 07:57.371
Betty, you're unbelievable.

07:57.437 --> 07:59.838
Only when i'm with you.

08:02.393 --> 08:05.504
Henry,
i can't find the toothpaste.

08:05.571 --> 08:08.038
Top left drawer!

08:08.105 --> 08:09.316
I'll see you tonight.

08:09.316 --> 08:11.394
Okay.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.112
Alexis,

08:17.112 --> 08:19.300
I got the numbers you sent me
on mom's magazine.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.504
<i>Good. 'Cause
we really need to talk.</i>

08:21.504 --> 08:23.738
Oh, my god.
What are you doing?

08:23.738 --> 08:26.144
Trying on the new domingo line.
Oh, get over it.

08:26.144 --> 08:27.999
When we were kids,
we used to bathe together.

08:27.999 --> 08:31.050
Yeah? Well, when we were kids,
you were a boy.

08:31.050 --> 08:32.984
So did you look
at mom's budget?

08:33.049 --> 08:35.451
Yeah, i did. I think
she's finally lost it.

08:35.518 --> 08:37.799
This was supposed to be
a hobby to make her feel better,

08:37.799 --> 08:39.950
Not a real magazine.
And check this out-

08:40.017 --> 08:42.441
She wants to do
an ongoing series

08:42.441 --> 08:44.878
About extreme adventure
for the over-50 set.

08:44.878 --> 08:46.551
It only adds
$50,000 an issue.

08:46.618 --> 08:49.317
You gotta talk to her. No.
You wanted to be in charge.

08:49.384 --> 08:51.284
This is your problem.

08:51.351 --> 08:54.534
Oh, amanda, hey.
So look, i know i'm not

08:54.534 --> 08:55.750
Supposed to be here,
'cause it's my birthday,

08:55.817 --> 08:57.816
And i was going away for
the weekend... to des moines?

08:57.816 --> 09:00.738
The poconos. Oh, well, anyone
who's anyone is going to des moines.

09:00.738 --> 09:03.237
My dad, gene simmons,
who's in the band kiss,

09:03.237 --> 09:05.817
Is playing there tonight.
Rock 'n' roll.

09:05.884 --> 09:07.884
I love saying that.
It totally feels right.

09:07.950 --> 09:11.050
Anyway, uh, my plans
have changedso i'm here,

09:11.050 --> 09:11.984
And i kind of have
a problem.

09:12.050 --> 09:14.251
Oh, right, 'cause you're turning 40? 24.

09:14.317 --> 09:16.925
I need to plan
a great new york birthday,

09:16.925 --> 09:19.737
And i figured,
if anyone knows, amanda knows.

09:19.737 --> 09:21.817
Where is the most romantic place
to have dinner in new york?

09:21.884 --> 09:24.950
Oh, my god. Right now
the pemberly inn is so hot.

09:25.017 --> 09:27.384
If i could sit
on the patio at sunset,

09:27.451 --> 09:29.484
I would make out with...

09:29.551 --> 09:30.984
Well...

09:31.050 --> 09:32.451
You.

09:35.128 --> 09:38.300
Okay. Pemberly inn.
Got it. Thanks.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.750
Happy 50th.

09:42.117 --> 09:43.551
Good morning, daniel.

09:43.618 --> 09:45.717
I bet you're surprised
to see me.

09:45.783 --> 09:48.441
Uh, should i be?

09:48.441 --> 09:50.925
Right. You weren't supposed
to come in today.

09:50.925 --> 09:54.084
Look, i'm sorry.
I've had a weird morning.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.783
Uh, glad
you're feeling better.

09:57.675 --> 09:59.441
I'm not sick.

09:59.441 --> 10:01.783
It's sort of
a special day today.

10:01.850 --> 10:04.783
Oh, my god. Oh, of course.
I almost forgot. It's okay.

10:04.850 --> 10:06.584
Renee's coming for lunch.

10:06.650 --> 10:09.650
Could you make sure and order us
something really special?

10:09.717 --> 10:12.550
Um, okay. All right.

10:12.550 --> 10:15.941
Uh, now, invites for tonight,
you have three options-

10:15.941 --> 10:18.941
Uh, ooh, dugout seats
to the yankees game

10:18.941 --> 10:21.384
And drinks with derek jeter-
Fun-

10:21.451 --> 10:23.984
Moby and natalie portman's
private reception

10:24.050 --> 10:26.750
For julian schnabel
at the gagosian-Cool-

10:26.817 --> 10:29.717
Mm. V.I.P. Tickets
to the new york philharmonic

10:29.783 --> 10:31.925
In central park and fireworks-
Not really up your alley.

10:31.925 --> 10:35.451
I'll just get rid of these. No,
no, wait. Concert with fireworks...

10:35.518 --> 10:39.237
I mean, that sounds kinda- Dangerous,
i know. I- I'm glad you're not going.

10:39.237 --> 10:42.518
No, no, hang on.
Maybe renee and i could...

10:44.425 --> 10:46.128
You know what? Forget it.

10:46.128 --> 10:47.315
I really don't want
to get grass stains

10:47.315 --> 10:48.690
On these pants anyway.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.175
Good point.

10:52.828 --> 10:54.862
The whole weekend is off?
What happened?

10:54.862 --> 10:56.269
Charlie happened.
Oh.

10:56.269 --> 10:58.936
She showed up
for a "surprise visit."

10:59.003 --> 11:01.236
Well, now we gotta
do something for betty.

11:01.302 --> 11:02.707
No. She already
made other plans.

11:02.707 --> 11:05.191
She's going to a concert
in the park tonight with henry.

11:05.191 --> 11:06.816
<i>Papi, you know
how much it means to her</i>

11:06.816 --> 11:09.800
<i>To be with him tonight. I know,
but it means something to me</i>

11:09.800 --> 11:15.409
To have the family together on birthdays. Hey,
what if i bring your cupcakes over to henry's,

11:15.409 --> 11:17.436
And then they can eat them
under the stars tonight

11:17.503 --> 11:20.436
And, like, we'll be there
in spirit? Getting eaten.

11:23.425 --> 11:25.999
Whoa. Oh. Sorry about the outfit.

11:25.999 --> 11:27.425
I just came
from hip-Hop class.

11:27.425 --> 11:30.436
I have big news.
I found the perfect apartment.

11:30.503 --> 11:32.569
Really? Yeah. And guess where it is?

11:32.636 --> 11:35.770
On spring, right around
the corner from your place.

11:35.836 --> 11:39.903
Huh. Uh...
sou-Sounds great.

11:39.970 --> 11:42.403
Okay, you're blinking a lot.
What-What's wrong?

11:42.469 --> 11:45.436
Oh, no, i-It's just
everything's happening so fast.

11:45.503 --> 11:47.836
You know? How well
do we really know each other?

11:47.903 --> 11:49.836
What are you saying?

11:49.903 --> 11:54.736
Uh, wilhelmina stopped by
my place this morning,

11:54.803 --> 11:57.169
And she said some things,
and, um...

11:58.238 --> 11:59.403
I'm just gonna ask you-

11:59.469 --> 12:02.137
Renee,
what is stony brook?

12:02.202 --> 12:04.003
Stony brook?
Mm-Hmm.

12:04.070 --> 12:06.202
What is stony brook?
Yeah.

12:06.269 --> 12:08.670
It's a state college
on long island.

12:08.736 --> 12:10.836
I went to school there,
daniel.

12:10.903 --> 12:13.770
Sure, i was a little wild.
I had a few boyfriends.

12:13.836 --> 12:16.566
You're not the only one who
had a life before we met. No.

12:16.566 --> 12:18.903
I- I-I'm amazed
th-That you would even care

12:18.970 --> 12:20.113
What my sister has to say

12:20.113 --> 12:22.863
After everything that's happened with
you two. Renee, i'm sorry. I just-

12:22.863 --> 12:24.565
No, i'm sorry.
Why don't you call me

12:24.565 --> 12:26.503
When you're ready
to trust me a little?

12:30.302 --> 12:34.436
Uh, yes, a table for two
on the patio.

12:36.403 --> 12:39.436
Oh, okay.
Yeah. Yeah, i understand.

12:39.503 --> 12:41.269
Um, no problem. Thanks.

12:41.336 --> 12:43.736
Uh, just-Could you
do me a favor?

12:43.803 --> 12:45.925
Could you tell your manager
that "mode" won't be needing

12:45.925 --> 12:48.425
The pemberly inn
for our big fashion week party,

12:48.425 --> 12:52.137
Where we spend many hundreds
of thousds of dollars?

12:52.202 --> 12:53.603
Oh, what's that?

12:53.670 --> 12:55.603
Something just opened up?
Great.

12:55.670 --> 12:59.803
Uh, it's suarez-
S- U-A-R-E-Z.

12:59.870 --> 13:01.436
Thank you.

13:03.703 --> 13:06.536
Gio... your hair.

13:06.603 --> 13:08.970
Summer's coming.
You gotta let the head breathe.

13:09.037 --> 13:10.936
So where have you been?

13:11.003 --> 13:12.403
Um, around.

13:12.469 --> 13:14.870
You know, just, uh, working,

13:14.936 --> 13:16.970
And, uh, living.

13:17.037 --> 13:18.703
Uh, yep, working and living.

13:18.770 --> 13:21.403
So the pemberly inn, huh?
What's the occasion?

13:21.469 --> 13:23.037
It's my birthday.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.603
Happy birthday.

13:24.670 --> 13:25.800
Thanks.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.738
So you going to dinner
with henry? Uh-Huh.

13:27.738 --> 13:30.175
Yeah, uh, we were supposed
to go away for the weekend,

13:30.175 --> 13:34.169
But, uh, charlie showed up.
Oh, the baby mama.

13:34.236 --> 13:36.169
Yeah, but, it-But, it's fine.
It's fine.

13:36.236 --> 13:37.862
Henry and i are gonna
have a perfect night

13:37.862 --> 13:40.503
Right here in manhattan-
An intimate dinner,

13:40.569 --> 13:42.137
And then a concert

13:42.202 --> 13:43.970
And fireworks in the park.

13:44.037 --> 13:47.137
You know, the only thing missing
is a carriage ride.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.670
Yeah.

13:50.169 --> 13:52.603
Wait, a-A carriage ride?

13:52.670 --> 13:54.836
Yeah.
Why'd you say that?

13:54.903 --> 13:55.425
I don't know.

13:55.425 --> 13:59.536
It just seemed like
somethin' you'd be into.

14:02.670 --> 14:04.603
It was good to see you.

14:04.670 --> 14:05.870
You, too.

14:05.936 --> 14:08.378
Sorry we don't talk
as much anymore.

14:08.378 --> 14:13.803
Yeah, well, you know,
just, uh, working and living.

14:15.703 --> 14:18.903
Yeah. Working and living...

14:24.487 --> 14:26.670
You bitch.
Well, hello to you, too.

14:26.736 --> 14:29.550
Why are you trying to break up me and daniel?
Renee, we both know what happens to you

14:29.550 --> 14:31.738
When things get
too serious with men.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.941
This is nothing
like stony brook.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.862
Good. It took a lot of work
to clean up that mess.

14:38.369 --> 14:39.803
I'm warning you-

14:39.870 --> 14:42.803
Leave us alone or you
will regret it, wilhelmina.

14:42.870 --> 14:45.836
I'm sure i'm not the only one
around here with secrets.

14:57.929 --> 15:01.697
Yes, amanda. What's your
favorite thing about getting old?

15:01.797 --> 15:02.779
Is it your hair thinning

15:02.829 --> 15:04.690
Or when kids ask you
about vietnam?

15:04.740 --> 15:07.994
Can i help you with something?
Yeah, you know that guy

15:07.994 --> 15:09.489
You're always pretending
is your boyfriend?

15:09.589 --> 15:10.640
He's on line two.

15:11.129 --> 15:16.488
Hey, birthday girl. Hi, i'm so glad you
called. I have a surprise for tonight.

15:16.488 --> 15:19.112
One word-Fireworks.

15:19.112 --> 15:21.800
That's two words. No,
technically, that's one word.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.613
Nerdapalooza.

15:23.613 --> 15:25.113
Amanda,
get off the phone.

15:25.113 --> 15:29.128
Well, i have a surprise for you,
too. Oh, henry, i have to go.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.191
My day's about
to get a lot better,

15:30.191 --> 15:32.300
But i'll call you back.
I love you. Bye.

15:34.195 --> 15:37.691
Daniel,
this is so sweet.

15:37.691 --> 15:38.988
Oh, good.
I mean, it better be,

15:38.988 --> 15:41.954
'Cause i gotta tell you,
renee is really mad at me.

15:42.021 --> 15:44.255
What is it
with me and women, betty?

15:44.321 --> 15:46.050
It's like
no matter what i do,

15:46.050 --> 15:48.188
I'm always letting 'em down,

15:48.255 --> 15:50.655
Especially the ones
i care about the most.

15:51.894 --> 15:52.737
Can you just make sure
she gets that

15:52.737 --> 15:54.925
As soon as possible?

15:55.988 --> 16:00.655
Okay, i'll send
a messenger right away.

16:05.088 --> 16:08.455
Cupcakes?
Aw, that's so sweet,

16:08.522 --> 16:09.925
But didn't you hear?

16:09.925 --> 16:12.321
There isn't gonna be
a birthday date.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.288
<i>Oh, didn't you hear?</i>

16:14.355 --> 16:16.855
Henry and betty have
a whole new plan for tonight-

16:16.921 --> 16:19.321
Fancy dinner,
romantic concert in the park,

16:19.388 --> 16:20.789
And then afterwards,

16:20.855 --> 16:23.800
Fireworks,
if you know what i mean.

16:23.879 --> 16:25.722
Well, you know what?
That's great for them.

16:25.789 --> 16:27.155
That betty, she, uh,

16:27.221 --> 16:29.655
Sure doesn't let anything
get in her way, does she?

16:29.722 --> 16:31.321
No, she doesn't,

16:31.388 --> 16:34.822
<i>But if it does,
i got her back.</i>

16:34.889 --> 16:36.822
These are not
just decorative.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.789
See ya.

16:57.191 --> 16:59.422
So what do you think?

16:59.488 --> 17:03.155
<i>Wow, mom, it's so saucy.</i>

17:03.221 --> 17:04.655
I know...

17:04.722 --> 17:08.454
And if you look closely,
you can see a nipple imprint.

17:08.521 --> 17:10.613
I've still got it.

17:11.454 --> 17:13.088
So listen, mom,

17:13.155 --> 17:14.588
We need to talk.

17:14.655 --> 17:16.588
Oh, that sounds ominous.
What is it?

17:16.655 --> 17:18.588
It's about the budget
for "hot flash."

17:18.655 --> 17:20.269
Given the current realities
of the market,

17:20.269 --> 17:24.121
I just-I can't put
any more money into the project.

17:24.188 --> 17:25.588
You're cutting me off?

17:25.655 --> 17:27.555
W- We haven't even
launched yet,

17:27.622 --> 17:29.954
A- And i still need
funding for a staff.

17:30.021 --> 17:33.822
I'm sorry. Don't do this
me. You're my daughter.

17:33.889 --> 17:36.221
I'm also your boss.

17:37.755 --> 17:40.622
Ooh. Let me help you
with that.

17:40.688 --> 17:42.588
I got it. Thank you.

17:42.655 --> 17:43.999
Wil said you'd be comin' by.

17:43.999 --> 17:46.300
She sure is working you
with all this baby stuff.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.999
I know,
but it's nothing

17:47.999 --> 17:49.737
Compared to what
she must be going through,

17:49.737 --> 17:52.925
Planning for motherhood
and all to-

17:53.362 --> 17:56.255
Where is she, anyway?
Deep tissue massage.

17:56.321 --> 17:58.688
Yeah, she skipped
the baby c.P.R. Class

17:58.755 --> 18:02.237
And made christina go alone.
Oh, oh. Of course she did.

18:02.237 --> 18:03.300
Well, maybe
the massage will help

18:03.300 --> 18:05.588
Circulate the ice
in her veins.

18:05.655 --> 18:07.425
Oh, oops.
Did i say that out loud?

18:07.425 --> 18:10.889
No, honey, please, it's okay.
I know how my sister is. Hmm.

18:10.954 --> 18:14.362
So, it is, uh, happy hour.

18:14.362 --> 18:15.988
I was just about
to make myself a drink.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.921
You like chocolatinis?

18:17.988 --> 18:20.422
Liquor and chocolate?
Oh, gee, i don't know.

18:20.488 --> 18:21.954
Bring it.

18:30.238 --> 18:31.425
Betty.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.050
Mrs. Meade.

18:33.050 --> 18:33.675
I'm so sorry.

18:33.675 --> 18:36.238
I try to keep up the appearance
that i never use the bathroom.

18:36.238 --> 18:37.800
I hope you won't
think less of me.

18:37.800 --> 18:41.999
Oh, um, no. No.
I really, really won't.

18:45.315 --> 18:46.088
Are you okay?

18:46.155 --> 18:47.550
Oh, my own daughter
just told me

18:47.550 --> 18:50.999
That she doesn't believe in
my magazine. Alexis said that?

18:50.999 --> 18:54.175
Well, not in so many words,
but it was pretty clear.

18:54.175 --> 18:57.175
She thinks the magazine
is just a fantasy, a pipe dream.

18:57.175 --> 19:02.789
So i have decided not to
move forward with "hot flash."

19:02.855 --> 19:04.522
I'm calling it quits.

19:04.588 --> 19:07.832
No. Mrs. Meade,
so what if it is a fantasy?

19:07.832 --> 19:10.021
That doesn't mean
you can't make it come true.

19:10.088 --> 19:14.021
Ju-Just today,
all of my dreams were crushed,

19:14.088 --> 19:16.522
And i-I picked myself up,

19:16.588 --> 19:18.831
I utilized my resources,

19:18.831 --> 19:21.155
And now things are gonna
be even better.

19:21.221 --> 19:23.255
Betty, what resources
do i have?

19:23.321 --> 19:25.722
Everyone i know
has turned their back on me.

19:26.488 --> 19:29.925
But you're the most resourceful
person i know.

19:30.688 --> 19:32.822
You can do anything.

19:38.755 --> 19:41.722
You're very perky,
you know that?

19:42.863 --> 19:45.175
I've heard that before.

19:45.855 --> 19:49.221
So what dreams of yours
were crushed today?

19:50.363 --> 19:53.238
Well, it's my birthday...
oh.

19:53.238 --> 19:56.655
And there was a change in plans,
but everything is fine.

19:56.722 --> 19:58.988
Henry and i
are going to dinner.

19:59.054 --> 20:00.522
How do i look?

20:06.054 --> 20:07.954
Oh, no, no. I couldn't.

20:08.021 --> 20:09.921
Yes, you can.

20:24.822 --> 20:26.255
<i>Hey, it's betty.</i>

20:26.321 --> 20:28.188
<i>Leave a message.
I'll call you back.</i>

20:28.222 --> 20:31.655
Hey, betty.
I've got some bad news.

20:31.722 --> 20:33.155
Charlie's not feeling well,

20:33.221 --> 20:36.121
So i'm gonna have
to take her to the doctor.

20:36.188 --> 20:39.655
Don't go to the restaurant.
I'll meet up with you later.

20:39.722 --> 20:41.789
Betty, i'm so sorry.

20:41.855 --> 20:44.622
Love you.

20:46.889 --> 20:48.789
<i>One unheard message.</i>

20:50.921 --> 20:53.255
<i>Betty-</i>

20:53.321 --> 20:54.722
<i>...go to the restaurant.</i>

20:56.255 --> 20:58.688
<i>I'll meet up with you-</i>

20:58.755 --> 21:00.155
<i>I love you.</i>

21:05.050 --> 21:08.548
Um, suarez.
Reservation for two.

21:14.175 --> 21:17.363
So willie really got that girl
to eat dog food?

21:17.363 --> 21:19.894
<i>Yeah, that girl
was her best friend.</i>

21:19.894 --> 21:21.558
She called it
a loyalty test.

21:22.675 --> 21:24.800
Portrait
of a mean girl, age 15.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.238
Wilhelmina's always been good
at getting people to do things

21:27.238 --> 21:30.234
They didn't want to do.
She still is.

21:30.301 --> 21:31.925
Really?
Oh, yeah.

21:31.925 --> 21:35.300
How so? Well, she practically
forced christina to carry this baby

21:35.300 --> 21:37.987
So she could get the money to
save her husband's life. No!

21:37.987 --> 21:42.701
Yes! And when chriina finds out who the sperminator
is... i thought it was an anonymous donor.

21:42.768 --> 21:44.867
It's bradford meade.
No.

21:44.933 --> 21:46.675
She stole the sperm
from his dead corpse,

21:46.675 --> 21:47.940
And when
the bastard heir is born,

21:47.940 --> 21:51.535
<i>She will finally get her hands
on a third of the meade empire.</i>

21:53.601 --> 21:56.363
Mm. Oh, i think
i'm gonna vomit. Excuse me.

21:57.050 --> 21:58.175
Thank you.

22:05.100 --> 22:10.067
<i>* quand tu dits
des mots d'amour *</i>

22:10.134 --> 22:13.567
<i>* des mots comme je t'adore *</i>

22:13.634 --> 22:16.268
* i love you more... *

22:16.268 --> 22:18.267
Are you ready to order?

22:18.334 --> 22:21.238
Um, actually, no, not yet.

22:23.175 --> 22:23.867
Or, you know what?

22:23.933 --> 22:27.668
Um, i could start
with a...

22:29.833 --> 22:32.550
The, uh...
uh, the-The cheese fondue.

22:32.550 --> 22:34.100
That dish is for two people.

22:34.167 --> 22:36.050
Oh. Yeah.
There will be two of us.

22:36.050 --> 22:39.034
Uh, my boyfriend is,
uh, on the way. He's coming.

22:39.100 --> 22:41.134
It is a lot of cheese.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.668
We're hungry.

22:42.734 --> 22:45.867
Okay, one cheese fondue
for you

22:45.933 --> 22:48.701
And your boyfriend.

22:48.768 --> 22:52.634
* la la la la la la *

22:54.200 --> 22:58.434
Okay. Okay, henry.
Thanks for calling.

23:00.878 --> 23:02.800
Henry is canceling on betty?

23:02.800 --> 23:04.867
Charlie's not feeling well.
Yeah, right.

23:04.933 --> 23:06.933
Beeyotch.

23:07.691 --> 23:09.601
What? You know you guys
were thinking it.

23:09.668 --> 23:12.925
<i>All right, familia suarez.
You know what this means.</i>

23:12.925 --> 23:15.167
Betty needs a party.
I got the piñata.

23:15.234 --> 23:19.363
I'll clear a dance floor.
And i'm making the cupcakes.

23:19.363 --> 23:21.972
And i was like,
"slow your roll, mary-Kate.

23:21.972 --> 23:25.863
You just can't call dibs
on every hot piece of... " pie.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.050
Gotta go.

23:27.050 --> 23:28.867
That is so sweet of you.
Thank you.

23:28.933 --> 23:31.034
Yeah, well, it's for betty.

23:31.100 --> 23:32.501
Ha.
What?

23:32.567 --> 23:35.100
You just reminded me
of a really funny story.

23:35.167 --> 23:37.925
See, betty's "boyfriend"
called earlier,

23:37.925 --> 23:39.267
And he is
totally blowing her off

23:39.334 --> 23:41.832
For their big birthday date
tonight. See?

23:44.144 --> 23:45.925
Did you give
her this message?

23:45.925 --> 23:49.175
I'm a receiver, not a giver.

23:49.175 --> 23:50.941
Can i have that now?

24:00.999 --> 24:03.425
How precious.

24:03.425 --> 24:04.862
Did you make it yourself?

24:04.862 --> 24:09.625
It's a gift from daniel,
"with all his love."

24:10.488 --> 24:13.862
Oh, you're not gonna ruin
this relationship, wilhelmina,

24:13.862 --> 24:16.113
Not unless you want your own
dirty laundry out in the open.

24:16.113 --> 24:19.659
Whatever are you talking about?
I know about bradford's baby,

24:19.659 --> 24:22.300
And your plan to g your claws
into the meade fortune.

24:22.300 --> 24:25.862
Oh, i know about all of it.
Mm, you know nothing.

24:30.488 --> 24:32.362
<i>She stole
the sperm from his dead corpse</i>

24:32.362 --> 24:33.999
<i>And when the bastard heir
is born,</i>

24:33.999 --> 24:35.175
<i>She will finally
get her hands</i>

24:35.175 --> 24:36.487
<i>On a third
of the meade empire.</i>

24:36.487 --> 24:38.300
<i>Oh, i think i'm gonna vomit.</i>

24:39.566 --> 24:41.965
Last time i checked,
sperm-Stealing was illegal.

24:42.862 --> 24:44.737
I think this is all
daniel's gonna need

24:44.737 --> 24:46.550
To go straight
to the police,

24:46.816 --> 24:48.813
Unless...
unless what?

24:48.863 --> 24:50.675
Less you leave
me and daniel alone.

24:50.675 --> 24:53.691
Let me have what i want,
and you can have what you want.

24:54.800 --> 24:55.987
You really want to do this?

24:55.987 --> 24:57.300
Oh, yes.

25:00.425 --> 25:01.500
Very well, then.

25:01.550 --> 25:04.300
I'm gonna go spend the night
at my boyfriend's.

25:18.675 --> 25:19.675
Madam-

25:19.675 --> 25:22.250
Mademoiselle, please.
I'm only 24.

25:22.300 --> 25:23.968
Yes, i'm so sorry.

25:24.033 --> 25:26.925
See, it has been a while,

25:26.925 --> 25:29.367
And it is friday night,

25:29.434 --> 25:31.200
And we are very booked.

25:31.267 --> 25:32.518
And?

25:32.518 --> 25:35.238
There is a couple
waiting for this table.

25:35.238 --> 25:38.300
It is their anniversary.

25:38.367 --> 25:40.100
It's my birthday,

25:40.167 --> 25:42.033
And-And my boyfriend-

25:42.100 --> 25:44.167
He's not here.

25:44.234 --> 25:45.734
We apologize.

25:45.801 --> 25:49.100
May i offer you
a doggie bag for the cheese?

25:55.434 --> 25:57.400
Cheers.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.367
Betty.

26:10.434 --> 26:12.200
Gio.
Whoa.

26:12.267 --> 26:13.734
What are you doing here?

26:13.801 --> 26:16.434
And why
are you in a carriage?

26:16.501 --> 26:18.367
Henry left a message
with amanda.

26:18.434 --> 26:20.434
He can't make it tonight.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.050
Charlie.

26:25.050 --> 26:28.234
So i'm not trying
to take his place or anything,

26:28.300 --> 26:30.050
But when i heard
you were on your own,

26:30.050 --> 26:32.238
I remembered my cousin drives
these things for tourists,

26:32.238 --> 26:35.456
And i thought, she deserves
to have a little fun.

26:36.313 --> 26:39.425
So what do you say?
Want a ride?

26:41.000 --> 26:43.175
I- I don't know, gio.

26:43.175 --> 26:47.112
Come on.
Once around the block.

26:48.844 --> 26:50.112
Fine.

26:50.613 --> 26:52.112
Once around the block.

26:52.112 --> 26:53.237
All right.

27:18.922 --> 27:20.188
Willie,
i know i screwed up,

27:20.238 --> 27:22.344
But breaking into
daniel's apartment,

27:22.394 --> 27:24.690
Isn't that a felony?
I'm too pretty for prison.

27:24.690 --> 27:25.737
They'll pass me around
like a collection plate

27:25.737 --> 27:29.050
At a catholic church.
Stop whining. You owe me.

27:29.050 --> 27:30.829
And prison is exactly
where i'll end up

27:30.896 --> 27:32.796
If they find out how this baby
was really conceived.

27:32.863 --> 27:35.929
I feel like you'd do
well in prison. I would.

27:35.996 --> 27:38.796
Hmm. Now relax. You
don't have to break in.

27:38.863 --> 27:40.425
Don'you think
i would have had

27:40.425 --> 27:43.230
An extra set of keys
made for daniel's apartment?

27:43.488 --> 27:47.909
Oh, marc, you underestimate
me. I hate myself even more.

27:48.096 --> 27:50.263
Okay, willie,
i'm going in.

27:51.268 --> 27:53.331
But if i don't
make it out alive...

27:54.535 --> 27:56.253
We'll always have bergdorf's,
darling.

28:00.263 --> 28:04.163
We all know what it's li
to be ignored,

28:04.230 --> 28:05.762
Taken for granted,

28:05.829 --> 28:08.096
Not valued.

28:08.163 --> 28:09.738
That is
never going to happen

28:09.738 --> 28:13.063
To the staff
at "hot flash" magazine

28:13.130 --> 28:16.896
Because this isn't
just a job.

28:18.396 --> 28:19.796
It's a family.

28:19.863 --> 28:21.296
Speaking of family,

28:21.363 --> 28:22.800
I'd like
to introduce you all

28:22.800 --> 28:25.263
To my beautiful daughter
alexis meade.

28:25.330 --> 28:26.754
Hello.

28:27.766 --> 28:29.362
Can i talk
to you for a sec?

28:29.362 --> 28:30.738
Mom, what's going on?

28:30.738 --> 28:32.963
I thought i told you there's
no money to hire a staff.

28:33.029 --> 28:34.929
Relax, darling,
i don't need your money

28:34.996 --> 28:37.796
Or anyonelse's.
I'm using my own resources.

28:37.863 --> 28:39.660
Turns out
there's a work program

28:39.660 --> 28:41.441
For recently released inmates.

28:41.441 --> 28:44.925
It's subsidized by the state, so my
overhead is minimal. They're prisoners?

28:44.925 --> 28:48.497
Ex-Prisoners... like me.

28:48.563 --> 28:52.363
Mom, do any of them
have any experience?

28:54.597 --> 28:56.063
They have life experience,

28:56.130 --> 28:58.563
And that's what "hot flash"
is all about-

28:58.629 --> 29:01.196
Your life just changed.
What do you do now?

29:01.263 --> 29:04.300
I can't think
of a better talent pool.

29:05.762 --> 29:07.628
All right,
let's get back to work.

29:08.050 --> 29:11.175
Whew! Anybody have a fan?
It is hot in here.

29:12.729 --> 29:14.191
And then the weekend
of my 10th birthday,

29:14.191 --> 29:15.972
There was this blizzard,

29:15.972 --> 29:17.425
So no one could
get to the party,

29:17.425 --> 29:18.238
And we couldn't leave
the house,

29:18.238 --> 29:20.800
So we had to eat
leftover cake for weeks.

29:21.200 --> 29:24.762
Hmm. Well, that's not so bad. Yeah.

29:24.829 --> 29:26.063
Whoa.
Why are we stopping?

29:26.130 --> 29:29.206
Snowflake has to take care
of some business.

29:30.996 --> 29:32.430
Oh.
Sorry.

29:32.497 --> 29:35.497
Not quite the birthday
you imagined, huh?

29:35.563 --> 29:37.497
Eh, it's my own fault.

29:37.563 --> 29:39.530
I had
thistupid fantasy-

29:39.597 --> 29:44.762
Fireworks, epic romance...
like romeo and juliet.

29:44.829 --> 29:47.696
Oh, you know those two
ended up dead in a tomb, right?

29:47.762 --> 29:49.996
Yeah, i don't like
thinking about that part.

29:50.063 --> 29:52.929
All right. Fantasies are fun,
but we live in reality.

29:52.996 --> 29:54.430
It's not perfect,

29:54.497 --> 29:56.925
But it doesn't mean
it can't be pretty good.

29:57.996 --> 29:59.430
I know.

29:59.497 --> 30:02.675
I know, i know,
and-And-And it is.

30:02.675 --> 30:03.688
I'm lucky,

30:03.738 --> 30:04.987
Except for the part
where henry's leaving me

30:04.987 --> 30:07.113
After his baby's born.

30:08.063 --> 30:10.729
It's getting late.
I should get home.

30:10.796 --> 30:13.563
No. You're not going home.

30:13.629 --> 30:14.785
I'm not?

30:14.785 --> 30:16.996
Nope. We're heading
to central park.

30:18.237 --> 30:19.829
We can still catch
the end of that show.

30:19.896 --> 30:21.729
Betty wants fireworks
for her birthday,

30:21.796 --> 30:23.425
<i>She's gettin' fireworks.</i>

30:37.296 --> 30:39.863
Hello?

30:52.530 --> 30:54.130
Hello.

31:02.963 --> 31:07.629
Oh, daniel meade,
you naughty, naughty boy.

31:07.696 --> 31:09.096
What are you doing?

31:09.163 --> 31:10.597
Oh, god.

31:10.662 --> 31:13.896
I, uh, i'm...

31:13.963 --> 31:15.263
I'm...

31:17.430 --> 31:19.029
I want you.

31:19.096 --> 31:20.296
Excuse me?

31:20.363 --> 31:24.488
<i>You, you big, sexy...
magazine editor.</i>

31:24.488 --> 31:25.530
I want you.
I love you.

31:25.597 --> 31:26.737
I've always loved you.

31:26.737 --> 31:29.497
Stop that.
This smells like wilhelmina.

31:29.563 --> 31:32.829
No. It smells like the beginning
of something beautiful.

31:32.896 --> 31:33.691
I'm calling the police.

31:33.691 --> 31:36.550
Oh! Well, we'll always have
this moment. Ciao.

31:41.497 --> 31:43.463
Have you heard from betty?

31:43.530 --> 31:45.063
Her phone's not working.

31:45.130 --> 31:47.285
<i>Ay. Here comes somebody.</i>

31:47.285 --> 31:50.441
Is it her? No, i need more time.
This banner is subpar.

31:50.441 --> 31:52.175
<i>Ay, just hang it.
Who cares?</i>

31:54.497 --> 31:55.362
It's not betty.

31:56.996 --> 31:58.963
Hi.

31:59.029 --> 32:01.130
Hi. Thought you were
at the doctor.

32:01.196 --> 32:03.096
I- I was.
Um, everything's fine.

32:03.163 --> 32:04.988
They couldn't find
anything wrong.

32:04.988 --> 32:08.300
I think charlie was just trying
to ruin my night with betty.

32:08.300 --> 32:10.696
I can't believe i fell
for it. Me, either.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.596
But this is your baby
we're talking about.

32:12.596 --> 32:14.816
What are you gonna do, right? Thanks.

32:14.816 --> 32:16.690
Just glad i didn't miss
betty's party completely.

32:16.690 --> 32:20.363
Is she here? Not yet. Thank you.

32:21.929 --> 32:24.050
I don't think
we're gonna make it.

32:24.050 --> 32:26.096
It sounds like
it's almost over.

32:26.163 --> 32:28.362
Somebody had to stop
for hot chocolate.

32:28.996 --> 32:31.430
What?
We're gonna make it, okay?

32:34.063 --> 32:35.063
What was that?

32:35.113 --> 32:37.437
Crap.
Think i busted a wheel.

32:37.487 --> 32:38.929
I'm gonna try
to rig something up.

32:38.996 --> 32:40.816
Oh, okay.
Well, here, i can help.

32:40.816 --> 32:42.300
No, no. No.
You stay in the carriage.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.300
I don't want you to
dirty your dress. Oh-Oh!

32:44.300 --> 32:46.128
Betty!
Oh, no.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.769
You okay?
I'm okay.

32:49.769 --> 32:51.800
Oh, no.

32:52.597 --> 32:53.300
Man, uh...
uhh...

32:53.300 --> 32:55.394
I think i have a, uh...

32:58.081 --> 32:59.362
Napkin.

33:01.230 --> 33:02.662
Okay.

33:02.729 --> 33:03.487
Thanks.

33:03.487 --> 33:04.659
Yeah.

33:05.312 --> 33:07.566
Uh, i'm so sorry, betty.

33:08.696 --> 33:10.597
This night sucks, huh?

33:12.078 --> 33:14.390
You're such a great girl.

33:14.440 --> 33:17.813
You're so good and nice,

33:17.863 --> 33:19.796
And you deserve to have
an amazing birthday.

33:19.863 --> 33:23.230
Gio, it's not your fault.
You did everything you could.

33:23.296 --> 33:24.696
It's fine.

33:24.762 --> 33:26.829
No. No, it's not. I'm-

33:26.896 --> 33:29.829
You know, i'm not a big believer
in this whole fantasy thing,

33:29.896 --> 33:33.063
But i at least wanted you
to have a little bit of yours.

33:33.130 --> 33:34.696
I'm sorry.

33:34.762 --> 33:36.425
I wasted your whole night.

33:37.696 --> 33:39.629
* you're not here with me *

33:39.696 --> 33:42.497
No, look. Look!

33:42.563 --> 33:45.896
* for you to stay *

33:45.963 --> 33:47.729
Fireworks.

33:47.796 --> 33:49.196
* in my arms tonight *

33:49.263 --> 33:50.729
* arms tonight, arms tonight *

33:50.796 --> 33:53.463
* i'm longing
to hold you tight *

33:53.530 --> 33:55.296
* hold you tight,
hold you tight *

33:55.363 --> 33:57.330
* need to hear you say
it'll be all right *

33:57.396 --> 33:58.996
* be all right, be all right *

33:59.063 --> 34:02.363
* i want you to say *

34:02.430 --> 34:05.196
* you'll be holding me
every night *

34:05.263 --> 34:07.130
* every night, every night *

34:07.196 --> 34:09.762
* in your arms
and out of sight *

34:10.375 --> 34:12.800
???

34:12.800 --> 34:14.297
This smells like wilhelmina.

34:14.397 --> 34:17.563
Oh, my-That is
exactly what i said.

34:17.763 --> 34:22.722
You know, look, i stupidly let
her get to me this morning.

34:22.722 --> 34:25.487
I messed up. I am sorry.

34:25.487 --> 34:27.696
No, i'm sorry, too,
daniel...

34:29.440 --> 34:31.565
Becausi haven't
told you everything.

34:31.565 --> 34:34.362
You can. Trust me.

34:36.987 --> 34:38.456
All right.

34:39.891 --> 34:41.282
Well,
it was back in college

34:41.331 --> 34:42.875
At stony brook.

34:42.925 --> 34:44.425
I had a breakdown,

34:44.425 --> 34:46.737
And i went
to a treatment facility.

34:47.237 --> 34:48.690
Still see a shrink.

34:49.998 --> 34:51.629
And, uh...

34:55.425 --> 34:58.999
I take these every day.

34:58.999 --> 35:01.366
- It was a long time ago,
you know,

35:01.431 --> 35:05.765
But i guess i'm still
a little sensitive about it.

35:05.832 --> 35:09.199
Thank you
for telling me the truth.

35:09.266 --> 35:09.879
Yeah.

35:09.879 --> 35:11.300
But if you think for a second

35:11.300 --> 35:13.988
That's gonna make me want
to be with you any less,

35:14.484 --> 35:16.988
You're wrong.
Really?

35:16.988 --> 35:22.487
Don't take that apartment.
Will you move in with me?

35:22.487 --> 35:24.238
Oh, hell, yeah.

35:26.398 --> 35:28.798
I wonder what mr. Dull
and sister crazy

35:28.865 --> 35:30.191
Are doing right now.

35:30.191 --> 35:31.832
Ugh, don't look at me.
I don't get straight people.

35:31.832 --> 35:34.534
Who ts what where?
It's all so confusing.

35:34.534 --> 35:37.175
Oh, speak of t she-Devil.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.165
Renee, what a surprise.

35:40.232 --> 35:42.165
Do you have a minute,
wilhelmina?

35:42.232 --> 35:43.925
I'd like to rub
something in your face.

35:43.925 --> 35:46.300
Well, someone's already doing
that right now, but go ahead.

35:46.300 --> 35:48.453
Daniel and i
are moving in together.

35:48.503 --> 35:51.238
Yeah, he's out getting champagne
to celebrate as we speak.

35:51.238 --> 35:53.363
Mm. Hip hip hooray.

35:53.363 --> 35:55.488
And, willie,
i know what you're up to.

35:55.488 --> 35:57.300
Did you really think
i'd be so stup

35:57.300 --> 35:59.988
As to just leave
that recording lying around?

35:59.988 --> 36:02.425
Well, you can't
blame a girl for trying.

36:02.425 --> 36:04.175
I'm not going away,

36:04.175 --> 36:07.363
So if you or marc
interfere again,

36:07.363 --> 36:09.531
I will release
that recording to everyone,

36:09.598 --> 36:12.398
And it'll be all over
for you, wilhelmina.

36:16.798 --> 36:19.932
Like i give a tinker's fart
about that recording.

36:19.999 --> 36:22.425
No one's gonna believe
the rantings of a drunken fool.

36:22.425 --> 36:24.132
Hey, feelings.

36:24.199 --> 36:26.299
Out.

36:26.366 --> 36:29.285
And no one's gonna believe
a crazy woman, either.

36:29.285 --> 36:32.798
Show me. Are you sure
those are the right pills?

36:32.865 --> 36:35.238
<i>They were the ones
in that hideous green bag.</i>

36:35.238 --> 36:38.032
What did you replace them with?
Your fat-Blockers.

36:38.099 --> 36:40.128
They were the only ones
that matched.

36:40.128 --> 36:43.232
Oh, marc, we want her crazy,
not crazy and thin.

36:43.299 --> 36:44.050
Oh, right.

36:44.050 --> 36:46.987
Well, no matter.
Those pills are all that stand

36:46.987 --> 36:49.425
Between my sister
and the nuthouse.

36:49.425 --> 36:51.800
In a few days, she'll start
losing a grip on reality,

36:51.800 --> 36:54.362
And then my plan
will be in motion.

36:56.363 --> 36:57.999
Sorry, renee.

36:57.999 --> 37:00.078
I' got
too much riding on this.

37:00.128 --> 37:01.425
In.

37:39.250 --> 37:41.703
Hey.

37:41.753 --> 37:44.688
You're home.
Hilda and justin are asleep,

37:44.738 --> 37:47.378
And, uh,
he wanted to wait for you.

37:49.596 --> 37:52.687
I can't believe you guys did
all of this and i missed it.

37:52.737 --> 37:55.170
You didn't have to do
anything special for me.

37:55.236 --> 37:58.804
You know what? I think all
of this was, um, more for me.

37:58.869 --> 38:01.570
Doing these kind of things
makes me feel good,

38:01.637 --> 38:04.070
Like i'm taking care
of my lile girl.

38:04.136 --> 38:06.570
But you're a grown-Up now.

38:06.637 --> 38:09.036
You don't need me
making cupcakes anymore.

38:09.103 --> 38:11.270
<i>Papi...</i>

38:11.337 --> 38:16.425
There will never be a day
when i don't need cupcakes...

38:18.036 --> 38:19.737
Or you.

38:27.136 --> 38:29.537
Actually, i could really use
e of those cupcakes

38:29.603 --> 38:31.036
Right about now.

38:31.103 --> 38:33.537
Well,
i may have a few... dozen

38:33.603 --> 38:35.036
Left in the kitchen.

38:35.103 --> 38:36.969
Really?
Mm-Hmm.

38:37.036 --> 38:38.925
Aah, you're the best.

38:44.070 --> 38:45.503
He willie,

38:45.570 --> 38:47.488
You know i've never been one
to second-Guess your choices,

38:47.488 --> 38:51.862
But can i ask you a question,
friend-To-Friend? Marc, you know i hate

38:51.862 --> 38:53.738
When things get personal
between the two of us.

38:53.738 --> 38:56.175
I do. I do. I know,
but it's just...

38:56.175 --> 39:00.691
What we're doing...
i mean, nee's your sister.

39:00.691 --> 39:02.936
There are things
in her past, marc-

39:03.003 --> 39:04.570
Terrible things.

39:04.637 --> 39:08.936
You have no idea what she's done
or what she's capable of.

39:11.869 --> 39:15.237
Renee and i were-

39:36.969 --> 39:40.337
I know you think i'm the
evil sister, marc... well...

39:40.403 --> 39:43.337
But at least
i stop short of murder.

39:47.570 --> 39:49.378
This is
the best birthday present

39:49.378 --> 39:50.878
I got all day.

39:51.337 --> 39:52.869
<i>Gracias, mija.</i>

39:52.936 --> 39:54.670
Oh, i almost forgot...

39:54.737 --> 39:56.050
What?

39:59.363 --> 40:02.770
I'm supposed to make sure
you get this.

40:04.675 --> 40:06.269
Daniel?
Mm-Hmm.

40:06.269 --> 40:07.470
Wh-When did he-

40:07.537 --> 40:09.550
He dropped it off
a couple of weeks ago.

40:09.550 --> 40:12.191
He just wanted to make sure
he didn't forget.

40:12.191 --> 40:14.570
He remembered he'd forget?

40:16.270 --> 40:18.770
Oh, i'm gonna
call it a night.

40:18.836 --> 40:20.303
Happy birthday, sweetie.

40:20.370 --> 40:21.936
Thank you, daddy.

40:22.003 --> 40:24.370
<i>Te quiero.
I love you, too.</i>

40:36.687 --> 40:39.140
Mm, betty.

40:40.238 --> 40:41.550
You're here.

40:41.550 --> 40:44.487
Yeah, i didn't want
to wake you.

40:44.487 --> 40:48.675
Hmm. I never got
a chance to tell you

40:49.500 --> 40:51.300
Happy birthday.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.940
Thank you.

40:56.869 --> 40:58.670
* in my dreams *

40:58.737 --> 41:00.770
I'm sorry it wasn't perfect.

41:00.836 --> 41:02.303
* i can fly *

41:02.370 --> 41:05.270
Yeah, me, too.

41:05.337 --> 41:08.303

41:08.370 --> 41:09.836
