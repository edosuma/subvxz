00:47.828 --> 00:51.389
(INDISTINCT EXCITED CHATTER)

00:51.798 --> 00:54.426
(INDISTINCT)

00:54.601 --> 00:57.069
Stand by. She's coming round.

00:58.171 --> 01:00.833
There's something out there, man.
We're clamping on.

01:01.007 --> 01:03.237
(ALL CHATTER)

01:03.443 --> 01:06.742
- Visual down! Radar down!
- We've lost the entire desk!

01:06.947 --> 01:09.074
(WHIRRING)

01:14.554 --> 01:18.046
- What are you all staring for?
- You've just unplugged the console.

01:18.258 --> 01:20.886
Right. I'm blow-drying my hair.

01:21.061 --> 01:24.519
- We're tracking a UFO.
- Oh, you're tracking a UFO,

01:24.698 --> 01:27.599
so I have to look like the Bride of Frankenstein?

01:27.801 --> 01:31.168
- Use another socket.
- This is beyond belief.

01:31.338 --> 01:35.172
A spaceship five miles long
without enough plug sockets!

01:35.375 --> 01:37.400
There's plenty of plug sockets, Cat.

01:37.577 --> 01:41.138
They're all taken up with your beauty aids.
Use a wall socket.

01:41.348 --> 01:45.614
What?! Unplug my hot wax strip
unsightly hair remover?!

01:45.819 --> 01:50.153
Yes. Unplug your hot wax strip
unsightly hair remover.

01:50.357 --> 01:52.348
I don't believe this.

01:52.526 --> 01:56.860
We finally encounter an alien species,
and I meet them with a wavery bikini line!

01:58.098 --> 02:01.397
It's back, bearing zero-niner-zero.
Adjust 1% portside.

02:01.568 --> 02:04.093
1% portside. C locked on...

02:08.908 --> 02:12.902
All right. OK. I'll use gel. Everybody happy?

02:13.547 --> 02:15.538
Stabilise pitch. Reduce correctives...

02:19.486 --> 02:22.148
- (LISTER) What is it?
- I have no idea.

02:22.322 --> 02:25.814
The craft does not appear
to be of Earth construction.

02:25.992 --> 02:28.756
Aliens. They're probably
going to return Glenn Miller.

02:28.962 --> 02:31.157
- What?
- That's what they do.

02:31.331 --> 02:33.731
People who inexplicably vanish, they return them.

02:33.900 --> 02:39.805
Ah, smeg! That's all we need. Glenn Miller
boring us with "Pennsylvania 6-5000".

02:39.973 --> 02:42.407
Kryten, open communication channels.

02:43.610 --> 02:46.545
<i>(RIMMER) We don't want himl Go awayl</i>

02:46.713 --> 02:49.876
<i>You took him. You can keep the smeggerl</i>

02:53.119 --> 02:58.580
How deliciously bizarre. The hall's molecular
structure conforms to no known element.

02:58.758 --> 03:03.855
Whoever or whatever made this thing
had access to a technology far ahead of our own.

03:04.064 --> 03:07.056
- OK, let's split up.
- Why? Why split up?

03:07.267 --> 03:09.497
- We can search quicker.
- What's the hurry?

03:09.703 --> 03:12.968
Have you got a major luncheon appointment?

03:13.173 --> 03:15.733
- What's your problem?
- I'm not going with him.

03:15.942 --> 03:19.139
- Me? What's wrong with me?
- You're totally egocentric,

03:19.312 --> 03:25.148
you flee at the first sign of trouble,
you're vain, selfish and self-obsessed.

03:25.352 --> 03:27.343
You just listed my best features.

03:28.555 --> 03:31.547
- I'm going with Kryten.
- Come on, Cat.

03:39.799 --> 03:44.759
Kryten, take point. I've seen those movies.
The guy in the lead always buys it first.

03:44.938 --> 03:50.342
Well, in my experience, the fellow
bringing up the rear gets picked off first,

03:50.510 --> 03:52.910
so the others aren't aware they're under attack.

03:53.079 --> 03:57.448
You're right. Can you take the front
and the back, so I'm in the middle?

03:57.617 --> 03:59.744
I'll do my best, sir.

04:13.166 --> 04:15.794
- Go, Kryten.
- <i>We've found something, sir.</i>

04:15.969 --> 04:18.529
- Yeah?
- <i>I think it's one of the crew.</i>

04:18.704 --> 04:23.404
<i>A hideously malformed triple-headed skeleton</i>
<i>with putrefied flesh hanging from it.</i>

04:23.577 --> 04:26.671
<i>It fell through Rimmer as we opened the lift door.</i>

04:26.846 --> 04:31.579
- Is he all right?
- <i>He's discovered what shirt tails are for.</i>

04:31.751 --> 04:36.620
<i>(RIMMER) All right. Don't make me sound</i>
<i>like a complete cowardly git. I'm fine now.</i>

04:36.790 --> 04:40.817
<i>(KRYTEN) Shall I cancel the order</i>
<i>to find your mother?</i>

04:40.994 --> 04:44.054
- <i>(RIMMER) Is that thing still on?</i>
- Hey, look at this.

04:44.264 --> 04:48.030
- Don't. We don't know what it does.
- I'm just looking.

04:48.201 --> 04:50.931
Cheers, man! Brilliant! I'm trapped!

04:51.104 --> 04:53.629
- Get me out of this thing.
- Be cool.

04:53.807 --> 04:56.401
I'm on the case. I remember the sequence.

04:56.576 --> 05:00.103
It was red-blue-yellow... No, blue-yellow-red.

05:00.313 --> 05:03.009
(GARBLED ELECTRONIC VOICE)

05:04.818 --> 05:07.286
What the smeg is that?!

05:07.721 --> 05:11.213
Curious, the skeletal form appears
to be basically humanoid in structure.

05:11.424 --> 05:13.688
He's got three heads.

05:14.527 --> 05:17.121
Wait. Here's some kind of wallet.

05:17.297 --> 05:21.290
The artefacts are human. A pilot's licence,
ID, even a video club card.

05:22.268 --> 05:26.728
This guy belonged to a video club
and needed a card so they'd recognise him?!

05:26.906 --> 05:30.307
He's got six eyes and three noses.
I'd remember him.

05:30.477 --> 05:34.743
"Aren't you the bloke who came in last week,
sneezed and caused a monsoon?"

05:34.914 --> 05:38.111
I think he started out as human
and something happened

05:38.284 --> 05:41.310
that mutated him in this unspeakable way.

05:41.721 --> 05:46.556
<i>(COMPUTER) Language trace completed.</i>
<i>Dialect English, colloquial, 23rd century.</i>

05:47.427 --> 05:49.327

05:49.529 --> 05:54.057
- Wait, I think I got it.
- <i>Transmogrification sequence initiated.</i>

05:55.368 --> 05:58.394
- Maybe not.
- Transmogrifi-what?!

<i>Gene sample accepted and cloned.</i>
<i>Please key in new genetic structure.</i>

06:03.276 --> 06:07.406
Do nothing. Press nothing. Get Kryten!

06:07.614 --> 06:13.553
Hey, you think I can't handle this? I have to
get Novelty-Condom-Head to bail you out?

06:13.720 --> 06:15.950
I got you into this, I'll get you out.

06:16.156 --> 06:19.922
- Get Kryten!
- Relax, would you? I know what I'm doing.

06:20.093 --> 06:22.823

06:23.029 --> 06:26.624
<i>Metamorphosis in ten seconds and counting.</i>

06:28.835 --> 06:31.531
I got a good idea. Why don't I get Kryten?

06:31.738 --> 06:35.674
Look, forget Kryten.
Just press the pads, any pads! Stop this!

06:35.842 --> 06:37.969
<i>Sequence complete.</i>

06:43.750 --> 06:46.378
(CLUCKS)

06:47.454 --> 06:51.788
Are you OK? We detected
a massive power surge in this sector.

06:51.958 --> 06:54.119
Where's Lister?

06:55.395 --> 06:59.764
- That's Lister?!
- What can I say, except... whoops?

07:00.967 --> 07:04.368
- What is it?
- Best guess? Some kind of DNA modifier,

07:04.537 --> 07:07.370
designed to alter organic life at its molecular level.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.872
This explains our triple-headed friend.

07:10.043 --> 07:13.945
- So what does it do?
- Every cell in your body contains DNA,

07:14.114 --> 07:17.345
a series of genetic instructions for your body.

07:17.517 --> 07:22.853
It's like a computer program that chooses
the colour of your eyes, shape of your nose,

07:23.056 --> 07:26.548
designates sex, height, even your lifespan.

07:26.726 --> 07:29.354
This machine rewrites the DNA program.

07:29.896 --> 07:35.562
So this machine can transform any living thing
into any other living thing?

07:35.769 --> 07:38.738
- Precisely.
- And it turned Lister into a chicken.

07:38.938 --> 07:42.499
- So it seems.
- Question is, can we turn him back again?

07:43.076 --> 07:45.271
The question is, do we want to?

07:45.478 --> 07:48.811
Hypothetically, it shouldn't be too difficult
to recall his original form.

07:48.982 --> 07:51.507
We simply have to decode the keypad.

07:51.718 --> 07:54.448
Listy? (CLUCKS)

07:54.854 --> 07:59.291
It's incredible. It really is him.
Look, it's even got his little beer gut.

08:00.193 --> 08:03.321
Hmm, seems a fairly straightforward
hexadecimal layout.

08:03.496 --> 08:05.987
Logically, this should be the recall sequence.

08:08.735 --> 08:11.033
(KRYTEN) That's not it, is it?

08:11.638 --> 08:15.438
Let's start from the top.
What happened here, exactly?

08:15.642 --> 08:19.578
I was pressing the pads.
I definitely pressed the yellow one first.

08:19.746 --> 08:23.204
And then this thing came down.
I'm pressing buttons,

08:23.416 --> 08:26.715
- then this voice said...
- <i>Transmogrification sequence engaged.</i>

08:26.886 --> 08:30.652
Right! So I press some more buttons,
and then it says...

08:30.857 --> 08:34.486
- <i>Please key in new genetic structure.</i>
- That's it exactly!

08:34.693 --> 08:37.958
- Cat, stop!
- No need to engage your panic chip, sir.

08:38.131 --> 08:42.260
The machine only operates on organic life.
I am mineral and therefore immune.

08:42.467 --> 08:47.167
<i>New genetic structure accepted.</i>
<i>Metamorphosis in ten seconds and counting.</i>

08:47.574 --> 08:51.510
Oh. Wait a minute. No. My brain is part organic,

08:51.678 --> 08:56.274
and therefore it is possible for the machine
to transmogrify my physical condition.

08:56.449 --> 08:59.680
Engage panic circuits... Panic circuits engaged.

08:59.853 --> 09:01.320
(WAILS)

09:02.222 --> 09:04.213
(BLEEPING)

09:07.026 --> 09:09.460
- (RIMMER) Are you OK?
- Yeah, I think so.

09:09.662 --> 09:13.758
- What was it like being a hamster?
- Better than being a chicken.

09:13.933 --> 09:17.562
You've seen the size of an egg?
You've seen a chicken's bum?

09:17.737 --> 09:22.936
That's what the clucking was about.
I was trying to say, "Give me a epidural!"

09:25.478 --> 09:29.141
Let's get Kryten back.
Press what you pressed for Lister.

09:34.454 --> 09:36.251
My heavens.

09:36.456 --> 09:38.617
I am human.

09:39.292 --> 09:41.283
Yeah, but you lost your looks.

09:44.664 --> 09:49.192
<i>I'm human</i> - <i>my greatest dream come true.</i>
<i>I can experience real feelings.</i>

09:49.369 --> 09:52.497
I'm experiencing one now. I'm in happiness mode.

09:52.672 --> 09:55.072
I've never experienced anything like it before.

09:55.241 --> 10:00.508
Except for that time I accidentally welded
my groinal socket to a washing machine.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.113
I'm alive!

10:11.090 --> 10:13.354
- How's he doing, Hol?
- Physically, he's fine.

10:13.526 --> 10:17.792
He's got the body of a perfectly normal
30-year-old human male... apparently.

10:19.532 --> 10:23.901
- Is he all right?
- He needs to adjust. Everything's a bit new.

10:27.006 --> 10:29.770
- Morning!
- Greetings, fellow human.

10:29.943 --> 10:34.937
Ah, breakfast, my very first meal.
Boiled chicken ovulations - delicious!

10:36.082 --> 10:39.449
- How you coping? Any problems?
- Just one or two.

10:39.619 --> 10:42.110
I've compiled a list, if you'll indulge me.

10:42.922 --> 10:46.983
Now, then, my optical system
doesn't appear to have a zoom function.

10:48.127 --> 10:52.791
- No, human eyes don't have a zoom.
- How do you bring a small object into focus?

10:55.034 --> 10:58.401
Well, you just move your head
closer to the object.

10:59.405 --> 11:03.933
I see. Move your head
closer... hmm... to the object.

11:04.110 --> 11:06.408
All right. What about other optical effects,

11:06.579 --> 11:08.774
like split screen, slow motion, Quantel?

11:11.651 --> 11:16.315
- No. We don't have them.
- You don't have them? Just the zoom.

11:16.889 --> 11:19.517
No, that's fine. That's great. No, that's great.

11:19.692 --> 11:22.252
Now, my nipples don't work.

11:24.897 --> 11:26.888
In what way "don't work"?

11:27.100 --> 11:32.128
Well, when I was a mechanoid,
the right nipple nut regulated body temperature,

11:32.305 --> 11:37.174
while the left was used mainly
to pick up short-wave radio transmissions.

11:37.343 --> 11:42.610
Now, no matter how hard I twiddle it,
I can't seem to pick up Jazz FM.

11:43.783 --> 11:47.150
- Human nipples don't do that, Kryt.
- I see. Fine.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.844
Ah, recharging.

11:49.022 --> 11:53.186
Now, I presume that humans recharge
much the same way mechanoids do.

11:53.359 --> 11:56.419
I have located what I presume
is the recharging socket,

11:56.596 --> 12:02.466
but for some strange reason,
it doesn't have the standard three-pin adaption.

12:04.737 --> 12:09.902
Now, do I need some kind of adaptor,
because the lead just keeps falling out?

12:14.247 --> 12:17.705
Kryten, we eat and sleep.
That's our way of recharging.

12:17.917 --> 12:19.350
Oh. Hmm...

12:19.552 --> 12:23.079
Ah, now,
I wanted to talk to you about something.

12:23.256 --> 12:26.350
Something I know we humans
get a little embarrassed about.

12:26.526 --> 12:31.725
It's a bit of a taboo subject, not the sort
of thing we discuss in polite conversation.

12:31.931 --> 12:35.731
Kryten, I'm an enlightened 23rd-century guy.
Spit it out, man.

12:35.935 --> 12:39.336
Well, I want to talk to you about my penis.

12:45.611 --> 12:49.342
I knew it. You've gone straight into smirk mode.

12:49.515 --> 12:52.916
Aren't we both adults?
Can't we discuss our reproductive system

12:53.086 --> 12:55.213
without adolescent sniggering?

12:56.122 --> 12:59.114
- Yeah, of course we can.
- Thank you.

13:05.231 --> 13:07.495
- Well?
- Well, what?

13:07.700 --> 13:11.431
- Well, what do you think?
- What am I supposed to say?

13:11.637 --> 13:13.229
Is that normal?

13:13.439 --> 13:18.706
Taking photographs of it
and showing it to your mates? No, it's not!

13:19.645 --> 13:22.273
Well, is it supposed to look like that?

13:23.583 --> 13:26.245
- Well, yeah.
- It's hideous!

13:27.353 --> 13:29.821
That's the best they could come up with?!

13:29.989 --> 13:34.085
Are you telling me there were choices,
and someone said, "Ah, that's it.

13:34.260 --> 13:38.754
"That's the shape we're looking for,
the last-chicken-in-the-shop look?"

13:38.965 --> 13:41.024
Shakespeare had one? Einstein?

13:41.200 --> 13:45.933
Perry Como sang "Memories Are Made Of This"
with one of those stashed in his slacks?

13:46.806 --> 13:50.799
- Well, yeah.
- No wonder humans don't have a zoom mode.

13:51.978 --> 13:53.969
Now, take a look at this.

13:55.948 --> 13:57.939
And this.

14:04.490 --> 14:07.152
Now, why do you suppose that happened?

14:08.361 --> 14:11.057
Wh-What were you thinking of at the time?

14:12.932 --> 14:18.063
Nothing in particular. I was just flicking
through an electrical appliance catalogue.

14:19.539 --> 14:22.531
I came across the section
on super de-luxe vacuum cleaners

14:22.708 --> 14:28.010
and suddenly my underpant elastic
was catapulted across the medical bay.

14:28.181 --> 14:32.379
You see, man,
you're neither one thing or the other.

14:32.585 --> 14:36.316
You shouldn't be getting erotic thoughts
about electrical appliances.

14:36.489 --> 14:41.859
It WAS a triple-bag easy-glide vac
with turbo suction and a self-emptying dustbag.

14:43.496 --> 14:46.090
Kryten, I don't care what model it was.

14:46.265 --> 14:50.998
No vacuum cleaner
should give a human being a double Polaroid.

14:52.071 --> 14:54.972
- Do yourself a favour, man. Change back.
- Back?

14:55.141 --> 14:59.475
Become one of those sappy,
sad-act mechanoids again? This is my dream.

14:59.679 --> 15:01.613
Hey, I've got a joke for you.

15:01.814 --> 15:04.647
How many mechanoids
does it take to change a light bulb?

15:05.484 --> 15:07.884
- I don't know.
- Twelve. You know why?

15:08.054 --> 15:11.387
- Why?
- Because they're so stupid! (LAUGHS)

15:11.557 --> 15:13.548
Isn't that the greatest joke?

15:13.726 --> 15:17.287
I've got another.
Heard about the mechanoid peeping Tom?

15:20.466 --> 15:22.661
(LAUGHS)

15:23.769 --> 15:26.863
(KRYTEN'S LAUGHTER ECHOES)

15:31.544 --> 15:34.980
Man, this is a totally whacked-out idea.
It'll never work.

15:35.147 --> 15:40.141
That DNA machine can do anything.
The hard part was finding one of my dead cells.

15:40.353 --> 15:43.584
You really think you can clone yourself
from your dandruff?

15:43.789 --> 15:48.249
Why not? Dandruff has DNA in it.
That machine has a clone facility.

15:48.461 --> 15:51.555
But a man made from dandruff? It'll never work.

15:51.731 --> 15:55.724
The first time you use medicated shampoo,
you'll disappear.

15:55.901 --> 16:01.203
I won't be made of dandruff. My body
will be recreated from the genetic pattern in it.

16:01.407 --> 16:04.103
- How's Kryten?
- Confused.

16:04.277 --> 16:09.112
If he offers to show you his photo collection,
my advice is decline politely.

16:09.315 --> 16:14.446
I bet he can't believe his luck. He's reached
the pinnacle of evolution. He's human.

16:14.654 --> 16:16.849
What's so big about being human?

16:17.056 --> 16:20.219
Listy, don't knock it till you've tried it.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.796
I just don't trust that machine.
I know it's old-fashioned,

16:24.964 --> 16:27.762
but I believe if God intended us to fly,

16:27.933 --> 16:30.731
he wouldn't have invented
Spanish air traffic control.

16:30.903 --> 16:33.394
That machine might be able to cure diseases,

16:33.572 --> 16:37.770
but you shouldn't use it
to change you into what you're not.

16:37.943 --> 16:41.379
Wasn't it Descartes who said, "I am what I am"?

16:42.348 --> 16:47.581
- No, it was Popeye the Sailor Man.
- Well, he was a hell of a philosopher.

16:47.753 --> 16:51.746
I think what he was saying
was stay true to what you are.

16:51.957 --> 16:55.825
Oh, here we go.
Typical knee-jerk techno-fear reaction.

16:55.995 --> 17:00.955
That machine is the greatest single
technological advancement mankind ever made.

17:01.133 --> 17:03.260
Greater than fire, greater than the wheel.

17:03.469 --> 17:05.800
What about the dude with three heads?

17:06.005 --> 17:08.940
- Well, he abused it.
- Someone always does.

17:09.141 --> 17:14.135
So you wouldn't use it? There's nothing
about your bodies you'd like to improve?

17:14.347 --> 17:20.479
Me?! Are you serious? Most people
leave their bodies to medical science.

17:20.653 --> 17:23.315
I'm leaving mine to the Louvre, baby!

17:23.521 --> 17:26.719
At some point,
most people wish they were someone else.

17:26.925 --> 17:29.724
This is going back years, before the accident.

17:29.929 --> 17:32.898
Kochanski had finished with me,
and I felt really pony.

17:33.065 --> 17:38.162
So I went for a walk in the botanical gardens
and saw this squirrel collecting nuts.

17:38.337 --> 17:42.330
It stopped and looked at me,
and I thought, "You lucky little sod.

17:42.508 --> 17:48.378
"You like your job. You have no woman trouble.
You'll never feel as bad as I feel."

17:48.547 --> 17:52.847
And at that moment, I would have given anything
to swap places with him.

17:53.786 --> 17:59.747
That's awful, man - when a woman screws
you up so bad you want to become a squirrel.

18:00.526 --> 18:03.689
It made me think
that being human isn't always fun.

18:03.896 --> 18:07.354
So, Lister, what are you telling us?
You're a closet squirrel?

18:07.533 --> 18:12.596
Behind closed doors, you parade around
in a strap-on bushy tail calling yourself Nutkin?

18:12.805 --> 18:18.300
I'm saying that being human
sometimes isn't all it's cracked up to be.

18:18.477 --> 18:24.643
If Kryten thinks it'll solve all his problems,
he's in for a major disappointment.

18:26.552 --> 18:28.816
(SNEEZES)

18:35.528 --> 18:39.658

We found this machine that's made me human.

18:41.066 --> 18:43.933
- You're a human now?
- That's right, Spare Head One.

18:44.103 --> 18:46.765
Our wildest,
most incredible dream has come true.

18:46.972 --> 18:49.964
- What's it like?
- It's indescribable, Spare Head Two.

18:50.142 --> 18:53.703
True, I'm having a few problems
coping with the human emotions,

18:53.879 --> 18:56.074
there's no zoom, the nipples don't work,

18:56.248 --> 19:00.685
and I could show you a snapshot
that would make your eyes spin.

19:00.853 --> 19:03.651
- That apart, it's all going well.
- What about us?

19:03.823 --> 19:08.089
- It was my turn to be main head next month.
- Obviously that's not possible.

19:08.260 --> 19:11.627
Aren't you happy for me?
I'm not second-class any more.

19:11.797 --> 19:16.325
What about Spare Head Three?
You can't just leave him. He's got droid rot.

19:16.502 --> 19:19.665
(YORKSHIRE ACCENT)
I don't need no bugger to look after me!

19:19.839 --> 19:23.707

but I don't need sympathy from 'im!

19:23.909 --> 19:26.707
Well, I'll still visit. I won't forget you.

19:26.912 --> 19:30.439

- I've been busy.

Ooh, hark at 'im! Orderin' his own heads around.

I may be 30,000 years old,

19:46.131 --> 19:49.999

but I'll tell you this for nowt -

19:50.169 --> 19:54.162
you came into this world a mechanoid,
and a mechanoid you'll always be!

19:54.373 --> 19:59.242
I don't have to take this from you.
I'm a human. Shut your stupid flat head!

19:59.979 --> 20:02.470
Kryten, I don't believe you just said that.

20:02.681 --> 20:05.445
I don't even know why I came here.

20:05.651 --> 20:09.485
I think you should leave now, Kryten.
There's nothing more to say.

20:09.655 --> 20:12.488
Aye, sling your bloody hook! Go on! Clear off!

20:13.392 --> 20:15.656

20:20.799 --> 20:22.790
Greetings, fellow human.

20:22.968 --> 20:26.233
"Fellow human."
How hollow those words sound now.

20:26.405 --> 20:28.396
What's eating you, man?

20:28.574 --> 20:33.807
I can't get the hang of these human emotions.
One moment I'm happy, the next I'm miserable.

20:33.979 --> 20:38.143
I'm up and down more
than a pair of kangaroos in the mating season.

20:38.350 --> 20:42.582
Depression's there for a reason.
It's the mind's way of saying something's wrong.

20:42.755 --> 20:45.747
What could be wrong? I've got everything I want.

20:45.958 --> 20:49.052
- Oh, yeah?
- No. I've done the most terrible thing.

20:49.228 --> 20:52.220
I've hurt my own kind, those closest to me.

20:52.531 --> 20:54.761
I've been a complete Polaroid-head.

20:54.967 --> 20:57.629
Yeah. You've had your head
up your recharge socket.

20:59.505 --> 21:01.700
Agreed. And you've known all along.

21:01.907 --> 21:06.537
Yeah, well. I did something similar once. Sold out.

21:07.980 --> 21:10.005
You sold out?

21:10.182 --> 21:14.141
Hmm. Look, this is between me and you,
OK, Kryten?

21:15.454 --> 21:17.945
Once, many years ago...

21:18.123 --> 21:20.557
I went into a wine bar.

21:23.963 --> 21:28.093
- That's it? You went into a wine bar?
- OK. Keep it down!

21:28.267 --> 21:34.263
- I don't want the whole world to know.
- What's so bad about going into a... WB?

21:34.440 --> 21:36.431
It means I was a class traitor.

21:36.609 --> 21:40.238
I could have been on that slippery slope -
hankering after pine kitchens,

21:40.412 --> 21:43.540
sleeping on futons, eating tapas.

21:43.716 --> 21:48.517
Who knows? I could have started
having "relationships" instead of "going out",

21:48.687 --> 21:52.145
got married, got on the property ladder.

21:52.324 --> 21:54.792
Who knows where it could have ended?

21:54.960 --> 21:59.761
Next thing you know, I'm playing squash
every Tuesday night with a bloke called Gerald.

21:59.932 --> 22:01.900
A lucky escape, man.

22:02.701 --> 22:07.570

It's what I always have been, always will be.

22:08.474 --> 22:11.375
And no bad thing. Let's do it.

22:11.677 --> 22:15.738
Kryten, a cartoon character called Popeye
said a really profound thing.

22:15.948 --> 22:19.111
- What did he say?
- "I am what I am."

22:19.318 --> 22:21.878
Are you sure? I thought that was Descartes.

22:22.087 --> 22:26.990
So did I, man.
It's so easy to get those two dudes mixed up.

- I've got it sussed.

22:33.098 --> 22:35.532
- We should try it first.
- What with?

- Well, anything organic.
- Hey, don't look at me.

22:39.004 --> 22:42.098
- I'm not. I'm looking at that container.
- Lister's curry?!

22:42.307 --> 22:46.334
It's organic. If we can change a mutton vindaloo
into a chicken vindaloo,

22:46.545 --> 22:48.536
we'll know it's safe for Kryten.

22:48.747 --> 22:51.409
Nice idea, Goalpost-Head.
