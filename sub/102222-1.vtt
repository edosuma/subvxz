WEBVTT

01:21.680 --> 01:22.715
<i>Xièxiè.</i>

02:46.498 --> 02:47.933
Isn't this home?

03:02.013 --> 03:04.049
For the book or the Town Car?

03:11.457 --> 03:13.692
Keep taking bets
through football season.

03:13.725 --> 03:16.061
Then I want to wash
my hands of it.

03:16.094 --> 03:18.564
We're in the basketball
business now.

03:18.596 --> 03:20.031
It's all on you, Alfred.

03:20.065 --> 03:21.734
That's right.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.736
Listen to your
Uncle Jackie, Alfred.

03:43.689 --> 03:45.725
It's for lunch money.

03:48.861 --> 03:50.495
Says "prep."

03:51.262 --> 03:53.231
They're definitely not
in the basketball business.

05:17.783 --> 05:20.986
Good morning, AP English class.

05:21.019 --> 05:22.721
Yeah.

05:22.753 --> 05:25.990
"Good morning, Mr. Richmond."

05:26.024 --> 05:27.560
Oh.

05:29.026 --> 05:31.630
Whether you know it or not,

05:31.663 --> 05:35.668
you are a coming-of-age story.

05:35.700 --> 05:39.671
That's right. This moment...
right here, right now...

05:39.704 --> 05:42.707
you are coming of age.

05:42.740 --> 05:44.810
Now, give me an example of

05:44.842 --> 05:47.546
a coming-of-age story
that you relate to.

05:52.918 --> 05:56.655
All right, Miss Eleanor.

05:56.687 --> 06:00.625
What is a coming-of-age story
that's affected you?

06:03.928 --> 06:05.597
<i>Free Willy.</i>

06:05.630 --> 06:07.599
Um, I'm not familiar.

06:07.632 --> 06:12.003
It's a movie about releasing
a killer whale into the wild.

06:12.036 --> 06:14.839
Man, free Max B.

06:14.873 --> 06:16.675
Mister... Alfred,

06:16.707 --> 06:18.344
welcome to AP English.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.212
I prefer my stripper name,
Boogie.

06:20.245 --> 06:22.114
Uh, okay. Ok...

06:22.147 --> 06:24.817
No, all right, all right,
that'll do.

06:24.849 --> 06:27.886
- Max B is in jail for murder.
- You got to hear both sides.

06:30.788 --> 06:32.257
Mr. Boogie,

06:32.289 --> 06:35.160
one day, we all meet our match.

06:36.995 --> 06:39.332
So...

06:45.404 --> 06:49.207
I present to you...

06:49.240 --> 06:51.110
Holden Caulfield.

06:52.243 --> 06:54.279
That's not what it says.

06:55.279 --> 06:57.048
Oh, Lord.

06:57.082 --> 06:58.750
I missed you.

06:58.784 --> 07:01.420
I'm gonna keep telling myself
that I missed you.

07:16.233 --> 07:18.002
- 'Ey, yo.
- Mm?

07:18.036 --> 07:21.240
Tell me this nigga ain't
staring straight into my trap.

07:21.272 --> 07:24.008
You mean this
Hunan beef on the curl machine?

07:24.041 --> 07:26.445
- Yeah.
- That's Boogie Chin.

07:26.478 --> 07:28.013
What's he doing here?

07:28.046 --> 07:30.014
- Don't he go to Bishop Molloy?
- Mm.

07:30.048 --> 07:32.151
He tested into City Prep
so he could play Monk.

07:32.183 --> 07:35.987
Personally, I think
he's wrapped like a wonton.

07:37.488 --> 07:38.923
- Fuck Monk.
- Mm-hmm.

07:38.957 --> 07:41.060
And fuck ballplayers.

07:41.092 --> 07:42.794
You know I can't quit
ballplayers.

07:44.062 --> 07:45.864
Man, it was quiet for ball

07:45.897 --> 07:47.766
till you transferred here.

07:47.798 --> 07:49.267
Now you got these little
Asian niggas

07:49.300 --> 07:51.704
pressing up your jersey
like you Jeremy Lin.

07:51.736 --> 07:53.237
Man, Jeremy Lin
can suck my dick.

07:53.271 --> 07:54.406
Man, what?

07:54.438 --> 07:56.274
I thought y'all
fucked with him.

07:56.308 --> 08:01.046
Nah, he more model minority
Jesus freak than he is Asian.

08:01.079 --> 08:03.749
- Chill, man.
- No shade, though.

08:03.781 --> 08:05.450
Yo.

08:05.483 --> 08:06.751
Who is that?

08:07.918 --> 08:08.988
Oh, that's Eleanor.

08:10.122 --> 08:13.025
He could get it
if he stopped staring.

08:13.058 --> 08:14.827
I really don't care.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.895
He could watch me suck
that sweet and sour sparerib.

08:16.928 --> 08:19.430
Girl, you just hungry talking
about all this Chinese food.

08:19.464 --> 08:20.933
Mm-hmm.

08:20.966 --> 08:22.434
Come on, man, back me up.

08:22.466 --> 08:24.870
No, bro, we got to get
to the elliptical.

08:24.902 --> 08:26.904
Shut the fuck up.

08:26.937 --> 08:28.873
- Nice pants.
- You got a staring problem.

08:28.906 --> 08:31.710
- You got a pretty vagina.
- Hey, yo.

08:34.411 --> 08:36.047
Get the fuck out of here

08:36.080 --> 08:37.281
with all that bullshit.

08:37.315 --> 08:38.850
You better respect my mind.

08:38.883 --> 08:40.084
Yo, facts, though.

08:40.118 --> 08:42.020
Hold on.

08:42.052 --> 08:44.889
I know this stew chicken
didn't say "facts" to my face.

08:46.424 --> 08:48.526
All the beef's gone bad.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.863
Mm-hmm. I'm 'bout to go vegan.

08:52.863 --> 08:55.500
- She wants it.
- My vagina?

09:05.142 --> 09:07.012
Get up.

09:09.314 --> 09:11.283
Use your eyes.

09:13.218 --> 09:15.286
Let's show 'em you can focus.

09:17.454 --> 09:19.257
I am focused.

09:19.291 --> 09:21.160
They give everybody else credit
for being passionate

09:21.193 --> 09:24.062
but look at me
like I have an illness.

09:24.094 --> 09:26.130
They're not gonna give us shit
in this country.

09:26.164 --> 09:27.866
You understand?

09:27.898 --> 09:30.835
No one believes
in an Asian basketball player.

09:30.868 --> 09:33.037
It's a joke.

09:33.070 --> 09:36.041
We can cook, clean,
count real good,

09:36.074 --> 09:39.178
but anything else,
we're picked last.

09:41.079 --> 09:43.982
But if you stick to our plans
and we beat Monk,

09:44.015 --> 09:46.151
we'll get our shot at the NBA.

09:49.454 --> 09:52.257
Well, I wish I could just beat
Memphis Houston

09:52.290 --> 09:53.925
and prove 'em wrong.

09:53.959 --> 09:55.294
Memphis?

09:55.326 --> 09:56.894
Come on.

09:56.927 --> 09:58.596
Memphis is soft.

09:58.629 --> 10:01.866
If you want to be the best,
you got to beat Monk.

10:01.900 --> 10:04.937
That's why I transferred you
to City Prep.

10:04.969 --> 10:06.470
<i>You got to show
those recruiters</i>

10:06.503 --> 10:08.339
<i>you're better than Monk.</i>

10:08.373 --> 10:10.408
<i>That you're the best
in the city.</i>

10:56.121 --> 10:57.923
What's up, Mom?

10:58.924 --> 11:00.358
Nothing.

11:00.392 --> 11:04.228
Same old fucking
ji bai bullshit, inshallah.

11:04.262 --> 11:05.998
You got to relax.

11:06.031 --> 11:07.431
Relax?

11:07.464 --> 11:11.136
Why don't you tell me
how to relax, huh?

11:11.169 --> 11:14.206
You and your father have
this crazy NBA dream...

11:18.008 --> 11:20.879
- How to relax?
- I can walk on at Georgetown.

11:28.987 --> 11:31.555
How are we gonna pay for it?
All we have are unpaid bills.

11:31.589 --> 11:33.558
Who cares?
It's my problem, not yours.

11:33.590 --> 11:35.459
You're always so miserable.

11:35.493 --> 11:37.128
I'm miserable?

11:39.296 --> 11:41.933
- Uh...
- Mm. What?

11:41.967 --> 11:44.002
I can get financial aid.

12:02.653 --> 12:04.689
Hmm?

12:33.651 --> 12:35.387
Boogie, run the play.

12:40.425 --> 12:42.127
Yo, float to the corner, fam.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.063
Boogie, use the screen.

12:45.563 --> 12:47.332
- Use the screen!
- Throw the ball, bro.

12:47.364 --> 12:49.000
Pass it.

12:49.033 --> 12:50.301
Come on.

12:52.270 --> 12:54.106
What happened?

12:56.041 --> 12:58.042
- That's selfish basketball.
- Look at this fucking cornball.

12:58.075 --> 12:59.478
What'd I tell
you about snitching, man?

12:59.511 --> 13:00.712
- All right.
- You got a wire on you?

13:00.744 --> 13:02.179
Everybody, relax.

13:02.213 --> 13:03.682
You want to borrow my phone,
call 911?

13:03.714 --> 13:04.682
Relax. Come on. He's just
doing the play you called.

13:04.715 --> 13:06.150
Come on.

13:06.184 --> 13:07.618
All right, everybody,
hit the showers.

13:07.651 --> 13:09.286
That's it for today.

13:11.422 --> 13:14.191
Think that's funny? Huh?

13:14.224 --> 13:16.094
I mean, a little bit.

13:16.127 --> 13:17.695
See next practice
if it's funny.

13:17.728 --> 13:19.564
Go take a shower.

13:19.597 --> 13:22.167
And you, I want to have
a conversation.

13:23.801 --> 13:25.637
Come on, guys, keep it moving.

13:25.670 --> 13:27.472
Nothing to see here.

13:27.504 --> 13:29.407
Chill out on the rubbernecking.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.343
Come on, speed it up.

13:31.376 --> 13:34.279
Snitches get stiches.

13:34.311 --> 13:36.714
Let's get this
Axe body spray going.

13:42.653 --> 13:44.588
We're all excited.

13:44.622 --> 13:46.391
We have a chance
to win every game

13:46.424 --> 13:48.627
with you playing on this team.

13:49.794 --> 13:52.130
But if you want to beat
Monk and Brooklyn...

13:52.162 --> 13:54.832
and let's be honest, it's
the reason why you're here...

13:54.866 --> 13:57.469
you have to start playing
team ball.

13:57.502 --> 13:59.271
This team is hot trash.

14:01.238 --> 14:03.075
You can't say that.

14:03.108 --> 14:05.577
It's a fact.
You won three games last year.

14:05.609 --> 14:07.645
You can't reduce people
to hot trash

14:07.679 --> 14:10.115
regardless of how many games
they lost last year.

14:10.147 --> 14:11.349
I'm not talking about them
as people.

14:11.382 --> 14:13.786
On the court,
team is hot trash.

14:16.854 --> 14:19.291
We didn't ask you to come here.

14:19.324 --> 14:21.726
You're here for
your own selfish reasons.

14:21.758 --> 14:24.195
You chose this family
when you transferred here.

16:48.272 --> 16:49.307
Hey!

17:25.742 --> 17:27.511
Oh, shit.

17:27.545 --> 17:29.381
- Damn.
- You always forget

17:29.413 --> 17:31.016
the south-side exit
got the fishmongers.

17:31.048 --> 17:33.550
Yo. How is Chinatown
next to SoHo?

17:33.584 --> 17:35.019
These gremlin keepers,

17:35.053 --> 17:37.055
they ain't learned
to boutique their shit.

17:37.087 --> 17:39.891
Yo, I need to see a white chick
cop a durian, for real.

17:41.459 --> 17:43.428
You been to this spot before?

17:43.460 --> 17:44.996
Nah, but my mom wrote
it up for <i>The Times,</i> though.

17:45.028 --> 17:46.698
Damn, your moms works for
<i>The New York Times?</i>

17:46.730 --> 17:48.499
Yeah. What your parents do?

17:48.533 --> 17:50.702
Man, my mom talks shit,
and my dad drives a Town Car.

17:50.735 --> 17:52.771
Hey, I mean,
my pop's Dominican,

17:52.804 --> 17:54.471
so you know I never met him.

17:54.505 --> 17:55.974
Man, you stupid.

17:56.007 --> 17:57.575
Hey, can't stop us now.

17:57.607 --> 17:59.344
Yo, that's Eleanor.

17:59.376 --> 18:00.978
Oh, shit, it is.

18:01.011 --> 18:02.746
You still want to go in?

18:02.779 --> 18:04.782
Yeah, I mean, she kind of bad

18:04.815 --> 18:06.985
when she not dressed
like Capone and Noriega.

18:16.526 --> 18:18.363
- I love this.
- Mm, I don't know.

18:18.395 --> 18:20.831
I think you're kind of
swimming in it. It's like...

18:20.864 --> 18:22.633
Yeah? I really like it.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.602
Oversize is cute, no?

18:24.634 --> 18:26.470
Oversize is cute,

18:26.504 --> 18:28.106
but you got them sleeves
looking like used condoms.

18:28.139 --> 18:30.342
- Excuse me?
- Out. Get the fuck out.

18:30.374 --> 18:31.742
- Damn.
- I'm sorry.

18:31.776 --> 18:34.446
- Get-get out.
- I'm trying to buy that.

18:34.478 --> 18:36.448
- He just gets like that sometimes.
- Sorry.

18:38.482 --> 18:39.650
Uncalled-for. Uncalled-for.

18:39.683 --> 18:42.921
So... what's good?

18:42.953 --> 18:44.555
You're a fucking asshole.

18:44.588 --> 18:46.590
Don't front.
You know that was funny.

18:46.623 --> 18:48.425
That girl and her little
influencer friends

18:48.459 --> 18:49.960
help keep the shop open.

18:49.994 --> 18:51.396
She got bread like that?

18:51.429 --> 18:52.863
She's 18 and sells Fit Tea.

18:52.896 --> 18:54.398
She don't spend money
on nothing

18:54.431 --> 18:56.034
but vintage and wet wipes.

18:56.066 --> 18:57.969
So you hate this chick
more than I do.

18:58.001 --> 18:59.603
Of course I hate this chick.

18:59.636 --> 19:01.105
I hate all these
fucking thirst traps

19:01.139 --> 19:03.007
with their spray tans
and their butt injections

19:03.039 --> 19:04.375
fucking up the game.

19:04.409 --> 19:05.977
Who doesn't hate a thirst trap?

19:06.009 --> 19:07.345
Don't front.

19:08.813 --> 19:11.016
Should come to the game
this weekend, though.

19:14.986 --> 19:17.421
I don't fuck with ballplayers.

19:19.090 --> 19:21.426
You ever huff
spray paint before?

19:21.459 --> 19:23.094
- Spray what?
- Hmm?

19:25.462 --> 19:26.964
- Go on.
- Shit, nah, but...

19:26.998 --> 19:28.499
I'm 'bout... I'm 'bout it all.

19:28.533 --> 19:30.568
This what you got to do
to get daddy mad?

19:30.601 --> 19:32.871
Ooh, shit.

19:32.903 --> 19:34.772
Damn, this is crazy.

19:34.805 --> 19:36.141
I like freaky girls like you.

19:36.173 --> 19:37.776
- All right.
- This is what I'm talking about.

19:37.808 --> 19:39.476
- Freaky like y'all do exciting stuff.
- Nah. Mm.

19:39.509 --> 19:40.944
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, you're doing good work out here.

19:40.978 --> 19:42.514
- Yeah.
- Like, you-you living life.

19:42.546 --> 19:44.181
'Ey, yo. Richie, you, too.
Get the fuck out.

19:44.215 --> 19:46.418
Okay.

19:46.450 --> 19:48.553
Damn, girl, I was actually
gonna cop something.

19:50.854 --> 19:53.424
- But now I'm not.
- Bye.

19:53.458 --> 19:54.892
Sorry.

19:55.927 --> 19:58.863
You will all present your own
coming-of-age stories,

19:58.895 --> 20:01.932
but as we see
in the literature,

20:01.966 --> 20:06.603
while you may one day stand
singular and triumphant,

20:06.636 --> 20:08.605
no one ever gets there alone.

20:08.639 --> 20:11.410
Except maybe Bilbo Baggins.

20:13.811 --> 20:15.647
John Wick?

20:17.547 --> 20:20.651
John Wick. Good.
I'm culturally relevant again.

20:20.684 --> 20:23.120
So, let's all break into pairs.

20:23.153 --> 20:26.825
I'll leave it to you
to choose your copilot.

20:26.857 --> 20:29.594
Don't be shy.

20:32.896 --> 20:35.566
Can you believe
I'm hungry again?

20:40.638 --> 20:42.674
Good day, madam.

20:44.007 --> 20:45.977
Yo, so what's up?

20:46.009 --> 20:47.912
About what?

20:49.212 --> 20:50.882
Being partners.

20:50.914 --> 20:53.584
Don't play yourself.

20:53.617 --> 20:55.052
What do you want?

20:55.085 --> 20:56.921
I-I... I want to...
I want to be partners.

20:56.953 --> 20:58.589
I want to read
the book together.

20:58.623 --> 21:01.226
We'll, like...
we'll get mad A's together.

21:02.226 --> 21:03.828
I'm spoken for.

21:03.861 --> 21:05.129
Damn, though.

21:05.161 --> 21:06.998
That was close.

21:07.030 --> 21:08.832
Good try, Arroz Con Pollo.

21:08.865 --> 21:10.567
You know,
you a little bit racist.

21:10.601 --> 21:12.737
- You know that, right?
- Nah, I'm just hungry.

21:12.769 --> 21:14.805
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

21:26.750 --> 21:29.219
I feel like the game is strong.
I don't know what it is.

21:29.253 --> 21:31.055
Is it strong?

21:31.087 --> 21:33.056
I feel like
a left-handed layup right now.

21:48.139 --> 21:49.873
What year was this again?

21:49.907 --> 21:51.743
June 5, 1989.

21:52.742 --> 21:54.278
One day after Tiananmen.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.882
Greatest moment
in Asian American history.

21:57.914 --> 21:59.983
This tennis match?

22:00.017 --> 22:01.184
Come on.

22:01.218 --> 22:03.153
Name another.

22:07.024 --> 22:08.660
Unbelievable.

22:08.692 --> 22:10.094
'08 Olympics.

22:10.126 --> 22:12.095
You cried when
Yao Ming carried the flag

22:12.129 --> 22:14.832
for the opening ceremony.

22:14.864 --> 22:19.202
8/8/08 was emotional,
but it was a ceremony.

22:19.236 --> 22:22.006
Plus, not Asian American.

22:22.038 --> 22:24.041
Linsanity.

22:24.075 --> 22:26.811
He gave the credit to Jesus.

22:26.844 --> 22:29.147
He did.

22:31.082 --> 22:33.284
What about the girl

22:33.316 --> 22:35.252
that designed
the Vietnam War Memorial?

22:35.286 --> 22:37.287
Ah. That was big.

22:37.321 --> 22:41.125
Maya Lin was only 21
when she designed that.

22:41.158 --> 22:44.762
But Michael Chang
won a Grand Slam.

22:44.795 --> 22:47.966
Mm, how old was
Michael Chang when he won this?

22:47.998 --> 22:50.969
17, same as you.

22:51.001 --> 22:52.669
I'm 18, man.

22:52.702 --> 22:54.238
You know what? Whatever.

22:54.270 --> 22:56.273
You've been watching this
old-ass tennis match from 1989

22:56.306 --> 22:58.942
over and over again.

22:58.976 --> 23:02.680
Against the number-one seed...

23:02.712 --> 23:05.882
If you were Chinese
in America in 1989,

23:05.915 --> 23:08.285
this match would matter to you.

23:08.318 --> 23:10.954
...who literally
should not be on the court.

23:10.988 --> 23:13.825
If you are just joining us,
you are joining us

23:13.857 --> 23:16.293
at one of the magic moments
in this sport.

23:16.326 --> 23:18.161
Double fault!

23:18.194 --> 23:22.265
Michael Chang
has won the match.

23:22.298 --> 23:24.267
I don't believe it.

23:26.170 --> 23:28.973
- Is the coach coming?
- He said 5:00.

23:29.006 --> 23:30.742
It's 5:10.

23:30.775 --> 23:32.811
He's gonna be here soon, okay?

23:35.813 --> 23:38.149
He's not gonna sit
in this chair, is he?

23:46.323 --> 23:48.159
What's wrong with the chair?

23:48.191 --> 23:50.694
What's wrong with this chair?
It looks like fuck.

23:53.029 --> 23:54.331
Dining room chair?

23:54.364 --> 23:56.800
We're not a Chinese restaurant.

23:56.834 --> 23:57.901
Xiao Ming?

23:57.934 --> 23:59.936
No.

23:59.969 --> 24:02.073
- It's my chair.
- No!

24:02.105 --> 24:04.941
- I like my chair.
- No, this is ridiculous.

24:04.975 --> 24:06.377
It's the best chair we have.

24:06.410 --> 24:08.647
This is not a spa.

24:10.081 --> 24:11.416
It's a great chair.

24:11.449 --> 24:14.017
Don't worry about it.

24:14.051 --> 24:16.254
Get ready.

24:16.286 --> 24:17.721
It's a good chair.

24:17.755 --> 24:18.989
It is a good chair, right?

24:19.023 --> 24:20.324
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

24:20.356 --> 24:21.191
- Welcome.
- What's happening?

24:21.225 --> 24:22.360
Thanks for coming.

24:22.392 --> 24:24.027
- Thank you for having me.
- Yeah.

24:24.061 --> 24:25.830
- Come in. Good to see you.
- How are you today?

24:25.863 --> 24:27.065
- All right.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Um, no shoes in the house.

24:27.097 --> 24:29.099
- Oh. Not a problem at all.
- Yeah.

24:29.132 --> 24:31.001
Hold on. Not a problem.

24:31.035 --> 24:32.937
- I'll put some respect on the house.
- Thank you. Thank you.

24:32.969 --> 24:34.771
- Absolutely. Boogie.
- Patrick.

24:34.805 --> 24:36.106
- What's up, my guy?
- Nice to see you.

24:36.140 --> 24:37.374
- How are you?
- Good.

24:37.408 --> 24:39.010
- The man of the house.
- Hey, Coach.

24:39.043 --> 24:40.378
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you for having me.

24:40.411 --> 24:41.978
How's the day going?

24:42.011 --> 24:44.047
Just hanging.
Uh, would you like some tea?

24:44.081 --> 24:46.384
Oh, nah, that's the official
beverage of the Sunken Place.

24:46.417 --> 24:48.151
- I'm cool on that.
- Oh, do you want some coffee, then?

24:48.184 --> 24:50.488
Uh, it's a little too late
for coffee, but thank you.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.155
- Beer? Yeah?
- Beer.

24:52.189 --> 24:53.458
A man after my own heart.

24:53.490 --> 24:54.991
I'd definitely take a beer.

24:55.025 --> 24:56.928
Everyone likes beer. All right.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.296
This chair is
very comfortable, man.

24:58.328 --> 24:59.796
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.

24:59.830 --> 25:01.165
Chinese beer.

25:01.198 --> 25:04.102
Chinese beer?
It says "Taiwan beer."

25:04.134 --> 25:07.204
- Oh, um, it's complicated.
- Oh.

25:07.238 --> 25:09.907
Okay. Well, look, man, uh,
thank y'all for having me.

25:09.940 --> 25:11.808
I know you got a big game
this weekend.

25:11.842 --> 25:13.044
Yeah, I'm-I'm looking
forward to it.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.311
Yeah, man. Hey.

25:14.344 --> 25:15.813
Dennis Thompson,
he's tough, but I know

25:15.845 --> 25:17.080
you got some tricks
up your sleeve.

25:17.113 --> 25:18.415
Yeah, we'll see.
I-I feel pretty good.

25:18.449 --> 25:20.317
Yeah, I'm not even worried
about that,

25:20.351 --> 25:21.919
but when you going against the
Dennis Thompsons of the world

25:21.951 --> 25:24.387
and the Monks, like,
you know, you just...

25:24.421 --> 25:26.824
you-you can't keep your foot
on the gas the way that you do.

25:26.856 --> 25:28.492
You know, you got to
switch up your speeds.

25:28.526 --> 25:30.862
You know, put some trust in
your teammates, stay focused.

25:30.894 --> 25:33.998
At the highest level,
it's-it's mental.

25:34.030 --> 25:35.499
- You dig?
- Mm-hmm.

25:35.533 --> 25:37.301
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

25:37.334 --> 25:38.369
- Hey, that's right.
- Thank you.

25:38.401 --> 25:39.804
Pops likes that.

25:39.836 --> 25:41.372
Okay, I'm sorry, Patrick,
but, uh...

25:41.404 --> 25:43.940
I mean, are you gonna give him
a scholarship or not?

25:45.543 --> 25:48.279
- Hey, hey.
- No, wait. I mean, this is a valid question.

25:48.312 --> 25:50.248
We've been talking
for over a year now, but...

25:50.280 --> 25:53.283
there's still
no scholarship offer.

25:53.316 --> 25:55.085
Hey, Mrs. Chin, you know, uh,

25:55.119 --> 25:57.155
like this beer,
it's complicated.

25:57.188 --> 25:59.157
But we can give Boogie

25:59.190 --> 26:02.026
a first-class education
at Georgetown

26:02.058 --> 26:04.161
and a walk-on spot on the team,

26:04.194 --> 26:05.529
and I'll connect him
with some of

26:05.563 --> 26:07.832
our financial aid advisors
and, you know,

26:07.864 --> 26:09.400
see what can happen,
but unfortunately,

26:09.432 --> 26:11.835
there are no scholarships
available right now.

26:23.346 --> 26:25.016
Welcome to the Barracks,

26:25.048 --> 26:26.249
where, if you're not
going hard,

26:26.283 --> 26:28.953
you should've stayed
on the FDR.

26:28.986 --> 26:31.122
You know how NY
gets it cracking.

26:31.154 --> 26:33.456
And by the way,
this is Monk's house,

26:33.489 --> 26:35.492
so if you trying
to be the best,

26:35.526 --> 26:37.195
you got to beat the best.

26:37.228 --> 26:39.397
And that's word to Artest.
Let's go.

26:39.430 --> 26:41.532
Oh, shit.

26:41.565 --> 26:43.500
Monk is here.

26:43.534 --> 26:46.871
The champ came
to stake his claim.

26:46.903 --> 26:48.839
Let's go, baby.

26:48.873 --> 26:50.074
- Everything good?
- No doubt.

26:50.106 --> 26:51.843
Y'all look at this nigga
right here.

26:51.875 --> 26:53.610
I see you, Chin!

27:00.049 --> 27:02.185
That nigga ain't
worth shit, man.

27:02.219 --> 27:04.588
- That ain't nothin'.
- Little cute-ass nigga.

27:04.622 --> 27:07.057
- Word. What up?
- Fire his ass up today.

27:07.091 --> 27:08.860
Let's get it poppin'.

27:11.594 --> 27:13.331
Monk, let's get it, baby.

27:20.304 --> 27:21.639
Let's go!

27:30.648 --> 27:33.184
A'ight, hit Monk.

27:33.217 --> 27:35.151
Spin on 'em. Serve it up.

27:35.184 --> 27:36.921
Banzai!

27:36.953 --> 27:38.588
Look who we have here.

27:38.622 --> 27:40.324
The Vanilla Gorilla.

27:40.356 --> 27:42.926
Memphis Houston
is in the building.

27:42.959 --> 27:44.495
The young Jedi has arrived.

27:44.527 --> 27:47.064
Try to pull a sword out
of stone on Monk's court.

27:47.096 --> 27:48.932
A'ight, what you gonna do,
Vanilla?

27:48.966 --> 27:50.435
Gotcha!

27:52.402 --> 27:53.570
A'ight, let's go, Monk.

27:53.603 --> 27:55.973
This your crib. Let's get it.

27:58.709 --> 28:00.945
Welcome to the party!

28:03.613 --> 28:05.248
Aah!

28:05.282 --> 28:07.518
Get 'em. Caught 'em.

28:07.551 --> 28:09.086
Split 'em both.

28:09.119 --> 28:10.388
Oh!

28:10.421 --> 28:12.257
What the fuck?

28:13.657 --> 28:16.360
Sure fucked this nigga, man.

28:16.392 --> 28:18.062
Somebody get this nigga
some crutches, man.

28:18.094 --> 28:19.596
Fuck it, he need a wheelchair.

28:19.630 --> 28:22.667
What the fuck is wrong
with you guys? Are you okay?

28:22.700 --> 28:24.302
Here.

28:24.334 --> 28:26.103
Patch him up.

28:27.270 --> 28:28.638
<i>That's what it means</i>

28:28.671 --> 28:30.240
<i>to you niggas, huh?</i>

28:30.274 --> 28:32.243
Who's fucking each other up?

28:32.276 --> 28:35.313
I don't enjoy doing it,
but if it's what I got to do,

28:35.345 --> 28:37.315
I'm-a do it.

28:37.347 --> 28:39.382
I wouldn't hurt someone
just to win a game,

28:39.415 --> 28:40.984
and I hope
you wouldn't, either.

28:41.017 --> 28:43.086
Why you so upset
about it, though?

28:43.120 --> 28:44.622
He's a bully.

28:44.654 --> 28:46.489
It's one thing
to cross someone.

28:46.523 --> 28:48.993
It's another to break their
ankles and then laugh at them.

28:49.026 --> 28:51.329
It's just a game.

28:51.362 --> 28:53.596
Yeah, I like talking about this
with you, though.

28:53.630 --> 28:55.733
That's just game.

28:55.766 --> 28:58.134
It's not game.
I've been consistent.

28:58.168 --> 28:59.603
Okay.

28:59.635 --> 29:01.571
I'm into you.

29:02.672 --> 29:04.709
What else are you into?

29:07.378 --> 29:08.947
Dominoes.

29:10.447 --> 29:12.116
You play dominoes?

29:12.149 --> 29:13.751
Yeah. I mean, I used to.

29:13.784 --> 29:15.652
What happened?

29:15.686 --> 29:18.456
My Uncle Jack, he don't want me
taking people's lunch money.

29:18.488 --> 29:20.458
He right, though.

29:20.490 --> 29:22.026
You nice?

29:22.058 --> 29:23.594
Not as nice as I am
at basketball,

29:23.626 --> 29:25.296
but I don't really care.

29:25.328 --> 29:27.065
I just like counting 'em up.

29:29.533 --> 29:33.004
That's the most Asian shit
you've said.

29:33.036 --> 29:34.671
- She shoots...
- Flying down.

29:34.705 --> 29:37.108
...she doesn't score.

29:40.276 --> 29:42.212
So, don't go too far left.
That make sense?

29:42.246 --> 29:43.714
Yeah, but... Yeah.

29:43.747 --> 29:45.548
So, I know you want to go,
like, down the middle

29:45.582 --> 29:47.351
and, like,
Michael Jordan airtime it.

29:47.383 --> 29:48.685
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, why not?

29:48.719 --> 29:51.154
So just go from over here,
here...

29:52.523 --> 29:54.125
You're good.

29:54.158 --> 29:55.559
Yeah.

29:55.592 --> 29:57.594
But it looks so cool
when you go fast.

29:58.728 --> 30:00.430
You know, when they're, like...

30:00.463 --> 30:02.599
- when you're, like...
- Oh, oh.

30:02.632 --> 30:04.201
Okay.

30:08.271 --> 30:09.806
- Oh!
- Oh, I got it.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.376
Get it.

30:12.342 --> 30:14.078
Shoot a couple.

30:14.111 --> 30:17.148
Feel like I need to put
some swag into it, you know?

30:17.180 --> 30:18.748
Let's go. You got it.
Put the swag in it.

30:20.484 --> 30:21.786
- Aw.
- Damn, I suck.

30:21.818 --> 30:23.453
It's like I'm going too high.

30:26.657 --> 30:29.126
- It's a miracle.
- Shut up.

30:29.159 --> 30:30.393
We out.

30:30.427 --> 30:32.530
Did you guys see that?

30:32.563 --> 30:35.366
We out. We out.

30:35.399 --> 30:37.267
That's what I'm talking about.

30:41.537 --> 30:44.776
Stay focused. Team defense.

30:47.777 --> 30:51.347
Close out! Close out!

31:01.825 --> 31:04.161
Oh, you fucked up now.

31:04.193 --> 31:05.361
You know what it is!

31:05.394 --> 31:07.097
All right, stay focused.

31:07.131 --> 31:09.300
This is our first
big test against Midtown Tech.

31:09.333 --> 31:10.868
Fuck it, we passing this test.

31:10.901 --> 31:12.635
Box, box.

31:14.604 --> 31:16.641
Clear it, clear it,
clear it, clear it.

31:27.851 --> 31:29.786
And all these scouts
that came out

31:29.819 --> 31:32.555
to see Dennis Thompson
and doubted my baby

31:32.588 --> 31:34.557
can choke on a ham bone.

31:34.591 --> 31:36.760
Listen, as a self-hating
Chinaman, I was skeptical

31:36.793 --> 31:38.863
about this Boogie character
coming to City Prep.

31:38.895 --> 31:40.897
Why? 'Cause he wasn't
playing Jenga with you

31:40.930 --> 31:42.399
in the boba spot?

31:42.431 --> 31:44.134
Perhaps.

31:44.168 --> 31:45.803
Terry, you got to stop hating.

31:45.835 --> 31:47.505
Do you see them yellow thighs?

31:47.537 --> 31:50.373
Mm, I see you, zaddy!

31:50.407 --> 31:52.409
What's "zaddy"? Is that an app?

31:52.441 --> 31:54.511
It's like
"daddy," but it's sexy.

31:54.545 --> 31:56.514
You just put some twang on it.
"Zaddy."

31:56.546 --> 31:58.281
There he goes. There he goes.

31:58.315 --> 31:59.883
All right.

31:59.917 --> 32:01.752
Boogie has busted Midtown,

32:01.785 --> 32:04.787
so now they're playing
Dennis on him mano y mano.

32:04.821 --> 32:08.292
A'ight, stay focused. Get that
zone set up on the defense.

32:11.260 --> 32:13.596
Yo, man, scouts is here
for Dennis Thompson,

32:13.630 --> 32:15.599
your man got us playing
this weak-ass zone.

32:15.632 --> 32:17.801
- He ain't my mans.
- Call the shot, nigga.

32:17.834 --> 32:18.902
One, one, one.

32:18.936 --> 32:19.837
Come on, don't go rogue.

32:19.870 --> 32:21.439
Stick to the plan.

32:22.805 --> 32:24.475
Play the zone.

32:30.581 --> 32:32.550
Time-out.

32:37.254 --> 32:38.822
Reading you like a menu, son.

32:38.854 --> 32:40.458
Come on. Too easy!

32:42.258 --> 32:43.661
Sit your ass down.

32:43.693 --> 32:45.796
- Don't play yourself.
- What?

32:45.828 --> 32:47.797
I'm the coach of this team.

32:47.831 --> 32:51.368
You respect the plays
that I call.

32:51.401 --> 32:53.437
That's a weird flex, Coach,
but a'ight.

32:53.469 --> 32:54.704
Excuse me?

32:54.738 --> 32:56.207
We're up 11.
It don't matter if I sit.

32:56.239 --> 32:58.575
You know what? Get out of here.

33:04.948 --> 33:06.650
With about three minutes left,

33:06.682 --> 33:10.353
Coach Hawkins has sent Boogie
to the locker room.

33:10.386 --> 33:12.455
Did you not agree with that?

33:22.632 --> 33:24.401
Why don't you go handle
the coach again?

33:39.315 --> 33:41.251
Shit.

33:41.285 --> 33:42.952
- Mrs. Chin.
- Huh?

33:42.986 --> 33:45.355
I'd like to introduce you
to Josh from St. John's.

33:45.389 --> 33:46.857
Mrs. Chin, Josh.
Nice to meet you.

33:46.890 --> 33:48.592
Hi. Nice to finally
meet you in person.

33:48.624 --> 33:49.959
Yeah, well,
it worked out this time

33:49.992 --> 33:51.728
because I'm here
to see Dennis Thompson.

33:51.761 --> 33:53.263
- Okay.
- Oh, I mean,

33:53.296 --> 33:54.832
Boogie put on a hell of a show,
for sure.

33:54.864 --> 33:56.566
That's, uh...
that's why I'm here now.

33:56.600 --> 33:57.968
Well, thank you.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.702
- We really appreciate that.
- Mm.

33:59.736 --> 34:01.537
Now, I'm gonna have to
confirm this with the coach,

34:01.571 --> 34:03.607
but I think we could
guarantee Boogie

34:03.640 --> 34:06.844
a non-scholarship spot
at St. John's next season.

34:09.645 --> 34:12.548
- A non-scholarship spot?
- Yeah. Yeah, exactly that.

34:12.582 --> 34:14.551
With all due respect,
Boogie could walk on

34:14.584 --> 34:16.486
- at any college and start.
- Mm-hmm.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.656
As I said inside, we're looking
for a scholarship offer.

34:18.689 --> 34:20.324
Hmm.

34:20.357 --> 34:22.960
Look, I love Boogie...
I really do... but...

34:22.993 --> 34:24.895
well, you saw him
self-destruct

34:24.928 --> 34:26.397
- at the end of the game.
- Well, I...

34:26.430 --> 34:28.031
Now, physically,
he's all there, but...

34:28.064 --> 34:30.433
mentally, he's raw.

34:32.335 --> 34:35.638
Maybe he's just passionate
about winning, Josh.

34:38.607 --> 34:41.711
Uh, let's keep in touch, okay?

34:41.745 --> 34:44.982
Mrs. Chin, it was a pleasure.

34:47.850 --> 34:49.886
Talk to you soon.

34:53.122 --> 34:55.692
Don't look at me like that.

34:55.725 --> 34:57.060
What'd he say?

35:07.437 --> 35:08.572
I don't have a problem.

35:13.944 --> 35:15.612
Meet Uncle Melvin.

35:15.645 --> 35:16.780
He can help you get
a scholarship

35:16.812 --> 35:18.114
into a Division I school.

35:18.147 --> 35:19.549
He'll clean up your mess.

35:24.587 --> 35:27.123
It's, uh,
nice to meet you, Alfred.

35:27.156 --> 35:28.992
He's your new manager.

35:44.841 --> 35:46.710
Mr. Chin, Alfred,

35:46.743 --> 35:48.712
pleasure to meet
with you both today.

35:48.745 --> 35:50.980
- Hmm.
- The pleasure is ours.

35:51.013 --> 35:53.017
And Alfred would like to begin
by saying something.

36:00.189 --> 36:01.892
Well, if Boogie's not ready,

36:01.924 --> 36:03.893
there are a few things
I want to get off my chest.

36:17.841 --> 36:20.544
I'm sorry, Coach Hawkins
and Principal Kodak.

36:20.576 --> 36:22.845
That's not necessary.

36:22.879 --> 36:24.915
This is our culture.

36:28.752 --> 36:31.788
I sincerely regret
embarrassing the school,

36:31.821 --> 36:34.825
my family and my ancestors.

36:34.857 --> 36:36.692
I'm extremely grateful
for the opportunity

36:36.725 --> 36:38.161
to play at City Prep

36:38.194 --> 36:40.564
and won't take it
for granted again.

36:40.596 --> 36:44.100
And we are happy
to have you, Alfred.

36:47.036 --> 36:49.006
I hope this is satisfactory

36:49.038 --> 36:51.575
and assures both of you
that Alfred has strong parents

36:51.607 --> 36:55.111
who value respect
and discipline.

36:55.145 --> 36:57.114
These are things
our culture is founded on,

36:57.147 --> 36:59.583
and without them,
we are nothing.

36:59.616 --> 37:01.785
It's water under the bridge.

37:01.817 --> 37:03.921
I mean, it's good to know
that Alfred values

37:03.953 --> 37:05.788
respect and discipline,

37:05.821 --> 37:07.857
and I look forward
to coaching him.

37:09.725 --> 37:11.093
Dude.

37:11.127 --> 37:12.962
Two million.

37:12.995 --> 37:15.798
Give me that back.

37:15.832 --> 37:17.468
Don't be mad.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.002
Yo, you ain't even
shuffled right, son.

37:19.035 --> 37:20.770
Oh, you're gonna blame it
on the shuffle.

37:20.803 --> 37:22.705
Clearly, bro, you got all
the money, you got all the...

37:22.739 --> 37:24.107
- This is not right.
- All right, well, you know,

37:24.140 --> 37:25.975
how about next time,
you shuffle the deck?

37:26.009 --> 37:27.811
Let's-let's just get to the
book real quick, you feel me?

37:27.843 --> 37:29.145
You really want to read this
book over playing this game?

37:29.178 --> 37:30.646
Look, I don't want
to read the book.

37:30.680 --> 37:31.982
I just kind of
have to read the book

37:32.015 --> 37:33.517
if I'm finna get into college.

37:33.549 --> 37:35.051
Like, I need to pass
this class, homey.

37:35.085 --> 37:38.188
I'm just saying, bro, like,
none of these books...

37:38.221 --> 37:41.225
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- ...that... none...

37:41.257 --> 37:43.826
the school has given me
did I connect to.

37:43.859 --> 37:45.127
Not one.
None of the characters,

37:45.160 --> 37:46.729
none of the stories, nothing.

37:46.763 --> 37:48.565
- It's fake, man.
- Man, we don't got to connect.

37:48.598 --> 37:50.200
We just got to get some grades,
you feel me, man?

37:50.232 --> 37:53.569
Have you ever connected to
anybody in a story like this?

37:53.602 --> 37:55.538
Legit, have you, in any book?

37:57.172 --> 38:01.812
I mean, my mom put me onto
this-this one dude Oscar Wao.

38:01.844 --> 38:05.047
He a Dominican cat, and, uh,

38:05.080 --> 38:08.117
he had to go back to the DR

38:08.151 --> 38:10.786
and live with his family
over there,

38:10.819 --> 38:13.990
and that shit was
pretty cool, actually, so...

38:14.024 --> 38:16.826
you know, if you keep looking,
there might be something.

38:19.828 --> 38:22.765
I need to pass
this class, homey.

38:22.799 --> 38:24.801
We'll finish
this shit after, bro.

38:24.834 --> 38:26.602
I'll take your money
afterwards.

38:26.636 --> 38:28.772
I should've bet.

38:31.875 --> 38:33.877
So, um, you don't think
it's likely

38:33.910 --> 38:35.612
that Alfred gets a scholarship

38:35.645 --> 38:37.648
to one of the top-ten schools
at this point, huh?

38:37.681 --> 38:39.249
No, I don't.

38:39.281 --> 38:41.218
The blowup in the last game
really hurt him.

38:41.250 --> 38:42.553
Oh, come on, Melvin.

38:42.585 --> 38:44.288
He's just aggravated because

38:44.321 --> 38:46.189
his father has him
on this suicide mission

38:46.221 --> 38:48.325
to beat the number-one player
in the five boroughs.

38:48.357 --> 38:50.893
- Don't think that's the issue.
- Okay.

38:50.926 --> 38:52.762
Listen.
Alfred is my only son,

38:52.796 --> 38:54.064
and I've sacrificed
everything for him,

38:54.096 --> 38:55.732
so I'm not gonna allow him

38:55.765 --> 38:57.268
to fall through the cracks
like his father did.

39:01.971 --> 39:03.640
You got to trust me.

39:04.841 --> 39:07.277
You brought me in to look out
for Boogie's best...

39:07.310 --> 39:09.880
"Alfred," please.

39:10.879 --> 39:13.616
Right. Alfred's interests.

39:17.921 --> 39:19.922
You know, it was actually
a very astute move

39:19.955 --> 39:21.123
to transfer to City Prep.

39:21.156 --> 39:22.292
Excuse me?

39:22.325 --> 39:24.127
That game against
Dennis Thompson,

39:24.160 --> 39:25.928
that's what opened
the door to China.

39:25.962 --> 39:27.998
- China?
- Yeah.

39:28.031 --> 39:30.601
See, this is actually what I
wanted to speak with you about

39:30.634 --> 39:33.036
before we got side-tracked
with scholarships.

39:33.069 --> 39:34.971
I took it upon myself

39:35.004 --> 39:38.307
to send Alfred's tape from the
game against Dennis Thompson

39:38.341 --> 39:40.844
to a few teams in the CBA.

39:40.877 --> 39:43.647
CBA is?

39:43.680 --> 39:45.382
The Chinese Basketball
Association.

39:45.415 --> 39:47.784
Okay.

39:47.817 --> 39:49.353
Alfred checks a lot of boxes
for China.

39:49.386 --> 39:51.088
- Yeah?
- He speaks Mandarin.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.956
- Mm-hmm.
- He has Chinese values.

39:53.989 --> 39:55.725
But he looks
culturally American,

39:55.759 --> 39:57.194
and he's good enough
to play here.

39:59.029 --> 40:01.131
I spun it as Alfred
bypassing the NCAA

40:01.163 --> 40:04.935
and choosing China
over America.

40:08.904 --> 40:11.075
The teams ate it up.

40:13.442 --> 40:15.011
They're going to make offers.

40:15.044 --> 40:17.813
Offers?

40:17.846 --> 40:19.850
Look, I know it's a lot
to take in,

40:19.882 --> 40:21.917
but you got to trust me.

40:24.386 --> 40:26.922
How did everyone feel

40:26.955 --> 40:28.392
about <i>Catcher in the Rye?</i>

40:30.393 --> 40:31.928
Mr. Todd.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.696
It's real. It reads like

40:33.730 --> 40:35.365
it could be written
by one of my friends.

40:35.397 --> 40:38.434
The observations he makes
about, uh, other students

40:38.468 --> 40:42.839
and adults
and just phonies in general,

40:42.872 --> 40:45.308
I can literally feel it
on my skin as I read.

40:45.341 --> 40:49.112
God, that's great that you had
such a visceral reaction.

40:49.145 --> 40:51.782
Even-even just
your description of it

40:51.814 --> 40:55.151
is-is very, um...
very touching.

40:55.185 --> 40:57.054
Thank you, Todd.

40:57.087 --> 40:59.355
Ah. Miss Eleanor.

40:59.388 --> 41:01.157
I agree with Todd.

41:01.190 --> 41:02.993
Holden questions.

41:03.026 --> 41:05.361
Questions what we're told
should matter to us,

41:05.395 --> 41:08.899
and he sees through them
as meaningless and phony.

41:08.931 --> 41:10.132
And it makes me think whether

41:10.165 --> 41:11.701
we actually have meaning
in our lives

41:11.734 --> 41:14.470
or if we're just...

41:14.504 --> 41:16.839
playing a game.

41:16.872 --> 41:18.374
Y'all crazy.

41:18.408 --> 41:20.243
Excuse me?

41:20.276 --> 41:24.181
Uh, Mr. Boogie, I am excited
to hear what you have to say,

41:24.214 --> 41:25.748
but let's honor decorum.

41:25.781 --> 41:27.084
Word.

41:27.116 --> 41:28.484
Please continue.

41:28.518 --> 41:30.454
- I can't stand Holden.
- That's interesting.

41:30.486 --> 41:32.421
I do like Mr. Antolini, though.

41:32.455 --> 41:34.458
Ah. That's weird.

41:34.491 --> 41:37.360
He's usually
the parents' favorite.

41:37.393 --> 41:39.396
- And most kids like Holden?
- Yeah.

41:39.428 --> 41:44.300
Your other classmates
look at him as a hero,

41:44.334 --> 41:47.870
or at least a...
an antihero of sorts.

41:47.904 --> 41:49.239
He's not a hero.

41:49.272 --> 41:51.074
He's just privileged.

41:51.107 --> 41:52.743
Anyone with that much free time

41:52.776 --> 41:54.411
is gonna be good
at complaining.

41:54.444 --> 41:56.980
You're a nihilist.
You think life is basketball.

41:57.013 --> 41:59.382
Playing basketball is gonna
save my broke-ass family.

41:59.415 --> 42:00.984
Okay, okay.

42:01.017 --> 42:03.754
Decorum.

42:03.786 --> 42:05.154
Mr. Boogie.

42:06.156 --> 42:09.392
Look, I'm-a just speak
for myself.

42:09.424 --> 42:13.129
There are a lot of kids like me
that have a lot of...

42:16.265 --> 42:18.401
...stuff going on at home,

42:18.433 --> 42:21.772
and they have no choice
but to grow up fast.

42:21.805 --> 42:24.341
I resent Holden
'cause he's looking for meaning

42:24.373 --> 42:26.343
and he's dying
for responsibility

42:26.375 --> 42:28.277
but doesn't have
the slightest idea

42:28.310 --> 42:30.113
of how that actually feels.

42:30.145 --> 42:31.914
Hmm.

42:31.948 --> 42:35.252
I want you
to speak up more in class

42:35.285 --> 42:37.254
like that, okay?

42:37.286 --> 42:38.788
That was really smart.

42:41.957 --> 42:43.459
You're lucky you have purpose.

42:43.493 --> 42:45.562
You don't want to know
what's going on in my house.

42:45.594 --> 42:47.430
Try me.

42:49.966 --> 42:51.468
Hello?

42:51.500 --> 42:53.803
I don't want to count it up.
Does that make sense?

42:53.837 --> 42:55.472
No.

42:55.504 --> 42:58.174
I'm not trying to play
struggle Olympics.

42:58.207 --> 42:59.942
I'm not, either,
but you the one

42:59.975 --> 43:02.111
that wanted to ask me
about my trash-ass life.

43:02.145 --> 43:03.880
Yeah, I want to know your shit,

43:03.913 --> 43:06.283
but I didn't think
you'd have to know mine.

43:10.252 --> 43:13.055
My mom,
she's a controlling psychopath

43:13.089 --> 43:15.826
that doesn't love
or believe in me,

43:15.859 --> 43:17.393
but she's responsible.

43:17.426 --> 43:18.995
My dad is irresponsible,

43:19.027 --> 43:20.964
but he loves
and believes in me.

43:20.997 --> 43:22.998
Your mom loves you.

43:23.031 --> 43:24.834
How do you know that?

43:24.868 --> 43:26.937
It's just one of them things...
parents love you.

43:27.937 --> 43:29.873
I really don't think
she fucks with me

43:29.906 --> 43:31.842
unless I succeed.

43:32.642 --> 43:35.212
Why's your life trash?

43:35.245 --> 43:37.513
My dad loves me,

43:37.547 --> 43:40.250
but it's kind of like
how a dog loves their owner.

43:40.283 --> 43:45.087
It's unconditional,
but it's unconscious.

43:45.120 --> 43:48.023
And my mom,

43:48.056 --> 43:50.861
she just wants me to be
more like my older sister.

43:50.893 --> 43:53.062
She thinks I'm
unnecessarily difficult

43:53.096 --> 43:55.265
and opinionated,

43:55.297 --> 43:57.566
and I'm just trying
to keep it real.

43:57.600 --> 44:00.036
Just want to be real.

44:00.069 --> 44:01.471
What's so funny?

44:02.471 --> 44:03.839
We sound like losers.

44:06.475 --> 44:08.878
Have you seen these docs like
<i>The Jinx</i> or <i>The Staircase?</i>

44:08.911 --> 44:10.413
Yeah, but what you
trying to say?

44:10.446 --> 44:12.082
How does someone that loves you

44:12.114 --> 44:14.017
end up throwing you
down a staircase?

44:14.049 --> 44:16.352
How does... how does O.J.
become O.J.?

44:16.386 --> 44:18.054
O.J.?

44:18.087 --> 44:20.390
How'd I get to this point
with my mom?

44:23.192 --> 44:26.029
You don't have to
smile about it.

44:26.062 --> 44:27.897
Nah, I mean, it...

44:27.931 --> 44:29.599
it's just funny.

44:29.631 --> 44:33.436
It doesn't have to be funny
if you don't find it funny.

44:35.437 --> 44:37.273
That was like a thank-you kiss.

44:37.306 --> 44:38.975
What's a thank-you kiss?

44:39.007 --> 44:41.911
Like, "Thanks
for listening, friend."

44:43.413 --> 44:46.315
I want you to kiss me
because you like me.

44:50.152 --> 44:52.355
I always liked you.

44:58.393 --> 45:00.462
You're annoying.

45:00.495 --> 45:02.631
Yeah, but I think you like it.

45:02.665 --> 45:04.433
- Just a little bit.
- I got to pee.

45:04.466 --> 45:06.568
- Again?
- What you mean, "again"?

45:06.602 --> 45:08.605
- We just... Goddamn.
- You're so rude.

45:08.638 --> 45:10.940
We got to navigate
around tai chi lady,

45:10.973 --> 45:13.242
but we out. Come on.

45:13.276 --> 45:16.478
I actually really
want to learn tai chi.

45:24.353 --> 45:27.290
<i>Oh, you think
you got me sewed up now?</i>

45:27.323 --> 45:29.658
<i>What? I'm not pump-faking you.</i>

45:29.692 --> 45:31.460
<i>I'm here with both feet
on the ground.</i>

45:31.493 --> 45:32.962
You getting gold or red?

45:32.995 --> 45:34.463
- Red.
- Done.

45:34.497 --> 45:36.466
- The gold look kind of cool.
- Don't you like the red?

45:36.498 --> 45:38.167
All right, all right.

45:38.201 --> 45:40.036
Y'all didn't want the smoke.

45:41.571 --> 45:42.639
Alissa, you...

45:44.506 --> 45:47.042
Uh-huh. Yo.

45:47.076 --> 45:48.111
You look nice from here.

45:50.712 --> 45:53.482
I didn't see you knock.

45:53.515 --> 45:55.451
A'ight.

46:06.194 --> 46:08.097
Hey, come here, come here.
Look, relax.

46:08.131 --> 46:09.466
Look at the scoreboard.

46:09.498 --> 46:11.401
We're winning.

46:11.433 --> 46:13.268
That was actually really smart.

46:13.301 --> 46:14.671
Because I can't go.

46:14.703 --> 46:17.039
That was a good move.

46:19.475 --> 46:21.444
Going into
your little fortress.

46:21.477 --> 46:22.679
Stop judging my stack.

46:24.413 --> 46:26.482
You really
think you slick, huh?

46:26.515 --> 46:28.250
You want to see the show?

46:28.283 --> 46:30.586
Aquariums are like Rikers
for dolphins.

46:30.620 --> 46:33.623
I do want to show you
my coming-of-age story, though.

46:33.656 --> 46:36.026
Okay.

46:37.326 --> 46:39.161
<i>You're not scared at all?</i>

46:39.194 --> 46:41.631
<i>I've never
been allowed to be scared.</i>

46:41.663 --> 46:44.000
<i>Why you scared, though?</i>

46:45.667 --> 46:47.069
Are you out?

46:47.102 --> 46:48.504
Cut the check!

46:48.538 --> 46:50.340
<i>Have you ever been in love?</i>

46:50.372 --> 46:53.242
Mm, nah.

46:53.276 --> 46:55.779
Mm, that's so good.

47:14.629 --> 47:16.698
<i>I want to show you something.</i>

47:16.732 --> 47:18.268
That's real romantic.

47:18.301 --> 47:19.736
I like it.

47:19.768 --> 47:22.171
That's a funny story
that I don't feel like

47:22.205 --> 47:23.672
getting into right now.

47:23.705 --> 47:25.741
Fine. My bad.

47:27.777 --> 47:30.514
I love this dolphin collection.

47:31.513 --> 47:33.450
From Trinidad.

47:34.817 --> 47:38.088
All this stuff
kind of fits, but why the cat?

47:38.120 --> 47:40.522
It was from my grandma.

47:40.556 --> 47:42.092
She passed away.

47:42.125 --> 47:43.726
This was always
on her coffee table.

47:43.759 --> 47:46.796
I don't even fuck with cats,
but I fuck with this one.

47:46.828 --> 47:48.730
It's Grandma, so I get it.

47:48.763 --> 47:50.099
It's cool.

47:50.132 --> 47:52.335
What is wrong with you?

47:52.368 --> 47:55.705
- What's wrong with me?
- Yeah.

47:55.738 --> 47:58.408
What's up with
this ice-skating music?

47:58.440 --> 48:00.877
Quit stalling
and just pull it out.

48:02.578 --> 48:04.114
Don't laugh.

48:04.147 --> 48:05.482
What?

48:05.515 --> 48:07.350
I never done this.

48:07.382 --> 48:09.618
That's cool, but you still
gonna have to pull it out

48:09.652 --> 48:11.654
if we gonna do this.

48:17.259 --> 48:19.294
You done this before?

48:19.328 --> 48:21.498
- Once.
- With who?

48:21.531 --> 48:23.399
None of your business with who.

48:23.431 --> 48:26.335
You gonna talk yourself out
of this if you keep playing.

48:28.937 --> 48:30.840
All right.

48:32.375 --> 48:36.146
I measured my shit hard,
and I'm above average,

48:36.178 --> 48:38.780
but...

48:38.814 --> 48:41.750
I'm soft right now.

48:41.783 --> 48:43.786
Let me see the wick.

48:50.426 --> 48:52.328
Damn.

48:52.361 --> 48:54.330
We might just
need to be friends.

48:54.363 --> 48:55.931
Fuck you.

48:55.964 --> 48:58.401
- I'm sensitive about this.
- I'm just playing.

48:58.433 --> 48:59.569
Why you so sensitive?

48:59.602 --> 49:01.671
You got this crazy music
pumping,

49:01.703 --> 49:03.672
and it's my first time.

49:03.705 --> 49:05.207
It's a lot of pressure.

49:05.241 --> 49:07.377
Relax.

49:12.582 --> 49:14.284
You ever fucked
with an Asian dude?

49:15.317 --> 49:16.718
Nah.

49:16.752 --> 49:18.353
I don't know why you tripping.

49:18.386 --> 49:20.622
I'm tripping 'cause
my dick might be trash.

49:34.971 --> 49:36.940
I'm good?

49:37.906 --> 49:39.942
You good, babe.

49:59.728 --> 50:01.364
Hey, Alfred.

50:02.665 --> 50:04.367
Yo, what's up?

50:04.399 --> 50:06.468
Alfred. How are you?

50:06.502 --> 50:08.772
I'm good.
Three weeks till we play Monk.

50:11.674 --> 50:13.576
Tang yuen.

50:13.609 --> 50:14.944
What's the occasion?

50:14.977 --> 50:16.745
Hmm. What's the occasion?

50:28.757 --> 50:30.660
Well...

50:32.460 --> 50:34.796
Me and Uncle Melvin
are working on a big plan

50:34.830 --> 50:37.400
to let you play basketball
in China.

50:39.968 --> 50:41.603
- China?
- Yeah.

50:41.636 --> 50:43.605
China's an amazing
opportunity, baby.

50:43.638 --> 50:45.374
It's a chance of a lifetime.
Right?

50:45.408 --> 50:47.410
Alfred, maybe we should start
at the beginning

50:47.442 --> 50:50.346
so you can get
a sense of, uh, context.

50:51.946 --> 50:53.582
Allow me.

50:53.616 --> 50:54.917
I'm the youngest.

50:54.950 --> 50:56.620
Okay.

51:08.564 --> 51:10.533
Thank you, Alfred.

51:10.565 --> 51:12.368
Cheers.

51:20.076 --> 51:22.045
So, I sent several teams
in the CBA

51:22.078 --> 51:24.614
a tape of your game
against Dennis Thompson.

51:25.614 --> 51:27.784
- Everyone was thoroughly impressed.
- Mm-hmm.

51:27.817 --> 51:29.485
And the Shanghai Sharks
came through

51:29.518 --> 51:31.721
with a one-year contract.

51:31.754 --> 51:34.591
$750,000.

51:35.623 --> 51:37.560
Guaranteed.

51:37.593 --> 51:38.960
That's a lot of money.

51:38.993 --> 51:40.629
I knew you'd be impressed.

51:41.730 --> 51:43.399
What's the catch?

51:43.431 --> 51:45.801
Vivian asked the same thing.

51:50.473 --> 51:52.442
There's no catch.

51:52.475 --> 51:55.444
Well, you'd relinquish
your college eligibility,

51:55.477 --> 51:57.646
but you can enter
the NBA Draft at 19

51:57.680 --> 52:00.049
once you satisfy your year.

52:01.850 --> 52:03.919
Mushi mushi.

52:24.105 --> 52:25.774
What's going on here?

52:25.808 --> 52:26.976
I was just in the middle

52:27.009 --> 52:27.910
of telling Alfred
some good news.

52:27.942 --> 52:31.147
You're, um, just in time.

52:31.180 --> 52:33.716
Who doesn't like good news?

52:36.951 --> 52:38.620
As I was telling Alfred,

52:38.654 --> 52:40.590
the, uh, Shanghai Sharks
have offered

52:40.622 --> 52:42.925
a one-year contract
to play in China.

52:47.797 --> 52:50.132
He's a good son.

52:50.165 --> 52:52.134
Absolutely.

52:52.167 --> 52:54.069
A great son.

53:02.111 --> 53:04.580
So, you think my son

53:04.613 --> 53:07.484
is gonna go behind my back
and sign this contract?

53:08.551 --> 53:10.520
We have our own plan.

53:10.553 --> 53:12.855
Nobody's going behind
anybody's back.

53:12.888 --> 53:15.658
We're all here
to discuss this together.

53:17.058 --> 53:19.428
Xiao Ming...

53:19.462 --> 53:21.631
did you know
we were going to discuss this?

53:27.736 --> 53:29.071
I didn't know.

53:29.103 --> 53:31.473
Melvin can save
our fucking family.

53:31.506 --> 53:33.209
Save our family?

53:33.241 --> 53:35.710
Did you hear that, Xiao Ming?
Melvin...

53:35.743 --> 53:37.212
Melvin is gonna save
our family.

53:37.245 --> 53:39.514
With all due respect,
Alfred doesn't even have

53:39.547 --> 53:41.450
a college scholarship offer
right now.

53:41.484 --> 53:43.018
The NBA is very unlikely
for him.

53:43.051 --> 53:45.654
- Knock on wood.
- Knock on wood?

53:45.687 --> 53:47.756
Lawrence, I'm not
knocking on wood.

53:50.526 --> 53:52.928
Knock on wood.

53:54.596 --> 53:56.832
Lawrence, this isn't the time
to go all Chinese

53:56.866 --> 53:58.167
and superstitious.

53:58.200 --> 54:00.102
We need to be practical.

54:03.105 --> 54:04.540
Hey! Stop!

54:04.573 --> 54:07.509
- Lawrence, no! Lawrence!
- Get off!

54:24.093 --> 54:25.761
It is my dream.

54:25.794 --> 54:27.263
You never thought I was
good enough to make it,

54:27.296 --> 54:28.797
because you weren't.

54:28.830 --> 54:31.233
All you do is talk shit
and blame Dad.

54:38.274 --> 54:40.009
Huh?

54:57.292 --> 55:00.262
Ask your dad who's
gonna pay these bills, huh?

55:00.296 --> 55:01.864
You can't walk on anywhere.

55:01.897 --> 55:03.699
- He's fucking broke.
- You don't know shit.

55:03.732 --> 55:05.869
Yeah, yeah, come.
You want to hit me, too?

55:06.868 --> 55:09.905
You have trash genes,
just like your father.

55:09.939 --> 55:11.306
He's not like his father.

55:11.339 --> 55:13.875
You assholes are gonna be
homeless without me.

55:13.908 --> 55:18.914
I got you a deal
for $750,000, cash money.

55:18.948 --> 55:21.616
Wait. Melvin, hang on a second.

55:21.649 --> 55:24.019
Melvin!

55:24.053 --> 55:26.221
I'll get the money.

55:26.254 --> 55:28.323
You just beat Monk
in three weeks.

55:28.357 --> 55:30.726
<i>If you beat Monk,</i>

55:30.759 --> 55:32.728
<i>none of this matters.</i>

55:35.029 --> 55:37.132
Let's go! Let's go!

55:50.212 --> 55:52.582
He doesn't look
anyone in the eye.

55:52.614 --> 55:54.716
Exactly.

55:54.750 --> 55:57.018
He's not playing the defenders.
He's playing the floor.

55:57.051 --> 55:58.086
Let's go!

55:59.788 --> 56:01.090
<i>I know your parents are putting</i>

56:01.122 --> 56:02.591
<i>a lot of pressure on you,</i>

56:02.625 --> 56:04.927
but it's generational.

56:04.960 --> 56:06.762
Their parents put it on them,

56:06.794 --> 56:08.363
their grandparents
put it on them,

56:08.397 --> 56:09.966
and so on and so forth.

56:09.998 --> 56:11.366
You know why
we're in this country.

56:11.399 --> 56:13.368
I know, Uncle Jackie.
We lost the war.

56:13.402 --> 56:14.971
We lost a war.

56:15.004 --> 56:16.372
That's why we're here.

56:16.404 --> 56:18.040
That's why we're
second-rate citizens

56:18.073 --> 56:19.775
in a country that resents us.

56:19.808 --> 56:21.310
You know, me and your dad,

56:21.343 --> 56:23.045
we never expected
to have freedom

56:23.078 --> 56:25.715
or independence or equality

56:25.747 --> 56:28.350
or any of these things you ABCs
expect to have in this country.

56:28.384 --> 56:29.785
I don't really have it, either.

56:29.817 --> 56:31.086
You don't.

56:31.120 --> 56:33.055
You don't have it
like these Americans,

56:33.087 --> 56:35.223
but you got more than we do.

56:35.256 --> 56:37.626
That's what we all
sacrificed for.

56:37.660 --> 56:40.696
But if I sign that deal,
I'd be giving it all back now.

56:40.728 --> 56:42.163
Back at zero.

56:42.196 --> 56:43.865
You could still play
in the NBA, right?

56:43.899 --> 56:45.901
- Yeah.
- Well...

56:45.933 --> 56:48.169
then you're still in
the basketball business.

57:04.719 --> 57:06.321
What's going on?
He didn't do anything.

57:06.355 --> 57:08.057
- Please step aside.
- We were just watching...

57:08.089 --> 57:09.924
I said step aside.

57:23.205 --> 57:24.907
Yes.

57:36.785 --> 57:38.254
I got to keep my mind clear.

57:38.286 --> 57:40.323
This shit is fucked up.

57:42.156 --> 57:44.826
I mean, can they even keep him
on these charges?

57:44.859 --> 57:48.698
It's usually not a big deal,
but my dad's on parole.

57:48.730 --> 57:49.864
For what?

57:49.897 --> 57:51.933
Assault. Twice.

57:55.236 --> 57:57.806
So, if you sign,
your dad walks?

57:57.839 --> 58:00.475
Yeah. He'll drop the charges.

58:00.509 --> 58:01.844
What's the downside?

58:01.877 --> 58:03.779
Determines where I play ball.

58:03.812 --> 58:06.114
Oh, so I ain't get
a say in this?

58:06.147 --> 58:08.149
Don't put more pressure on me.

58:08.183 --> 58:09.485
You think I want to leave you?

58:09.518 --> 58:11.087
Who said anything
about leaving?

58:12.453 --> 58:14.422
I'm not trying
to put pressure on you.

58:14.455 --> 58:16.925
I understand how difficult
this family shit is.

58:16.959 --> 58:18.127
It's not just about family.

58:18.160 --> 58:20.328
I owe like 5,000 years

58:20.361 --> 58:22.263
of fucking Chinese history.

58:22.297 --> 58:24.800
What you mean, "5,000 years
of fucking Chinese history"?

58:24.832 --> 58:26.334
You don't understand.

58:26.368 --> 58:28.270
Your parents don't hold it
over your head

58:28.303 --> 58:30.038
that they sacrificed
everything to give you

58:30.071 --> 58:31.372
- this opportunity in America.
- Okay.

58:31.406 --> 58:33.275
Not the exact same thing,
but do you know

58:33.308 --> 58:36.879
how fucking hard it was for me
to find out where I come from?

58:39.448 --> 58:43.419
My history was fucking ripped
from me.

58:43.451 --> 58:46.221
I was cut off
from my ancestors.

58:46.254 --> 58:49.758
You're not the only one
who deals with these problems.

58:54.296 --> 58:55.864
Okay.

58:55.897 --> 58:57.999
Do you like beef with broccoli?

58:58.033 --> 58:59.801
Yeah. Who doesn't?

58:59.835 --> 59:01.504
Italians... they got
broccoli rabe on the menu

59:01.536 --> 59:03.404
right next to the braciole.

59:03.437 --> 59:05.140
This motherfucker said
"beef and broccoli."

59:05.174 --> 59:06.408
Okay.

59:06.440 --> 59:08.511
The Greek...
they have garlic broccoli

59:08.544 --> 59:10.145
right next to the shell steak.

59:10.178 --> 59:13.181
So?

59:13.214 --> 59:15.017
So, anyone could have
put them together,

59:15.049 --> 59:17.419
but only the Chinese
were willing

59:17.451 --> 59:19.087
to bow their heads
and serve something

59:19.120 --> 59:21.122
as stupid and basic
as beef with broccoli.

59:21.156 --> 59:23.859
Okay, there's nothing stupid
about beef and broccoli.

59:23.892 --> 59:26.161
Beef and broccoli isn't stupid.

59:26.194 --> 59:28.797
It's fed neighborhoods,
and it's sustained us,

59:28.830 --> 59:31.033
but Chinese people
could be so much more

59:31.065 --> 59:33.435
if this country didn't reduce
us down to beef and broccoli.

59:33.468 --> 59:35.538
You can be so much more, too.

59:35.571 --> 59:36.906
It's hard.

59:36.939 --> 59:38.406
I feel like a piece of beef

59:38.439 --> 59:41.176
surrounded by sprouted greens
and MSG.

59:47.149 --> 59:50.585
I need you
to fight for yourself

59:50.618 --> 59:54.122
the same way you fight
for being Chinese.

1:00:08.437 --> 1:00:10.473
Alfred, you made it.

1:00:31.259 --> 1:00:33.296
Two signatures.

1:00:42.069 --> 1:00:44.272
You're doing
the right thing, Alfred.

1:00:52.047 --> 1:00:53.949
You should look this over.

1:00:53.982 --> 1:00:55.551
There's a bunch
of stipulations.

1:00:55.584 --> 1:00:59.288
It potentially limits your
playing time with City Prep.

1:00:59.321 --> 1:01:01.489
Just drop the charges.
Get my fucking money.

1:01:44.966 --> 1:01:48.403
What's up, little man?

1:01:48.437 --> 1:01:51.973
I seen you taking notes
at the Barracks.

1:01:52.006 --> 1:01:54.342
Now it's time for me
to take my notes.

1:01:54.375 --> 1:01:56.144
Know what I'm saying?

1:01:57.145 --> 1:01:59.248
Take it easy, man.

1:01:59.281 --> 1:02:01.549
Nice new haircut.

1:02:02.584 --> 1:02:06.154
Just got a report they say
you was an angry little dude.

1:02:06.187 --> 1:02:08.356
Come on, guys.

1:02:08.390 --> 1:02:10.692
- Guys, it's not necessary.
- We good.

1:02:10.725 --> 1:02:13.328
I ain't worried
about this little kid.

1:02:15.596 --> 1:02:17.933
Yeah, grab your backpack.

1:02:22.770 --> 1:02:25.140
Hey, tell Juicy I said,
"What's up?"

1:02:25.172 --> 1:02:26.741
Who the fuck is Juicy?

1:02:26.774 --> 1:02:30.478
Oh, your girl didn't tell you
I used to call her Juicy?

1:02:35.716 --> 1:02:38.152
Hey, well, ask her
how my dick taste, nigga.

1:02:40.388 --> 1:02:42.323
Salty!

1:04:08.843 --> 1:04:11.579
Yo. You know I don't
give a fuck if you smoke.

1:04:11.613 --> 1:04:13.448
The game's tomorrow night, B.

1:04:13.482 --> 1:04:15.317
Yeah, fuck it.
Doesn't really matter

1:04:15.350 --> 1:04:17.152
what happens in the game
tomorrow.

1:04:17.185 --> 1:04:18.620
How you figure?

1:04:18.652 --> 1:04:20.721
My dad's in jail again.

1:04:20.754 --> 1:04:22.825
My mom sold me to China.

1:04:22.857 --> 1:04:24.826
My girl's a liar.

1:04:24.859 --> 1:04:26.761
Who cares anymore?

1:04:28.129 --> 1:04:29.731
She ain't lie to you.

1:04:31.399 --> 1:04:34.536
She should've told you,
but she ain't lie to you.

1:04:34.569 --> 1:04:36.171
Word.

1:04:36.203 --> 1:04:38.841
I should've known it was
"don't ask, don't tell."

1:04:38.873 --> 1:04:41.343
So you ain't tell Eleanor
about China yet?

1:04:41.375 --> 1:04:42.710
Fuck you.

1:04:44.312 --> 1:04:48.851
My man, I'm trying to help you
pick up the pieces here.

1:04:48.884 --> 1:04:50.786
I don't give a fuck
anymore, man.

1:04:50.819 --> 1:04:52.788
I got nobody.

1:04:52.821 --> 1:04:54.757
Who am I picking up
the pieces for?

1:04:57.192 --> 1:05:00.329
Look, I know that even if
I play my best tomorrow night,

1:05:00.361 --> 1:05:02.263
I'm not touching Monk.

1:05:02.297 --> 1:05:05.167
You're the only one
who has a shot at beating him.

1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:07.169
All right, don't be
like that white boy

1:05:07.201 --> 1:05:09.671
"Colden Haulfield"
or whatever the fuck.

1:05:09.703 --> 1:05:11.339
A'ight, that's not you.

1:05:11.372 --> 1:05:13.541
Don't you want to know
if you can beat him?

1:05:13.575 --> 1:05:14.710
Fuck Monk.

1:05:15.710 --> 1:05:17.646
My man, fuck you.

1:05:19.413 --> 1:05:21.816
Everyone on that team
wishes they was you,

1:05:21.850 --> 1:05:24.419
but they not,

1:05:24.451 --> 1:05:26.187
so they give up shots,

1:05:26.221 --> 1:05:29.158
they play defense.

1:05:29.190 --> 1:05:31.493
We do the dirty work
all season long

1:05:31.526 --> 1:05:33.761
so that you get your shot.

1:05:35.330 --> 1:05:36.732
It's a team game.

1:05:36.765 --> 1:05:38.167
Ain't about me.

1:05:38.200 --> 1:05:40.669
Oh, so now you a team player.

1:05:40.701 --> 1:05:42.236
I've been a team player.

1:05:42.270 --> 1:05:44.773
My man, this has always
been about you.

1:05:46.373 --> 1:05:49.944
Your plan to beat Monk,
your shot at college,

1:05:49.977 --> 1:05:53.481
your dream to make it
into the NBA, a'ight?

1:05:53.515 --> 1:05:56.384
Everyone here is here for you.

1:05:58.620 --> 1:06:01.556
And now you're not even here
for your goddamn self.

1:06:28.350 --> 1:06:29.618
Does he realize

1:06:29.651 --> 1:06:30.953
how important this game is?

1:06:30.986 --> 1:06:32.520
Man, he's gonna get here.

1:06:32.553 --> 1:06:34.256
It's just, you know...

1:06:38.526 --> 1:06:40.928
Richie, Boogie's gonna
miss shootaround.

1:06:40.962 --> 1:06:42.698
You know where he is?

1:06:42.730 --> 1:06:45.667
Yo, you pressing on me
like a 7-Eleven Cuban, Coach.

1:06:45.700 --> 1:06:47.468
- Yo, he'll be here.
- Chill out, man.

1:06:47.502 --> 1:06:49.438
- 7-11 Cuban?
- You're making these kids nervous, man.

1:06:49.471 --> 1:06:50.706
Come on.

1:06:50.739 --> 1:06:52.608
What's a 7-Eleven Cuban?

1:06:52.640 --> 1:06:54.676
It's a sandwich.

1:07:08.756 --> 1:07:10.325
You ready?

1:07:12.893 --> 1:07:14.796
You ready? You?

1:07:15.696 --> 1:07:18.032
It's simple.

1:07:18.065 --> 1:07:20.935
This game, this moment,

1:07:20.968 --> 1:07:23.638
all the hard work,
all the sweat, all the drills,

1:07:23.672 --> 1:07:26.875
it's what we've been
working for.

1:07:26.908 --> 1:07:28.944
And we did it as a team.

1:07:28.977 --> 1:07:31.446
Not as one person; as a team.

1:07:32.747 --> 1:07:35.484
Let's go. Come on!

1:07:35.517 --> 1:07:37.285
Let's get it. Let's get it.
Let's get it.

1:07:37.319 --> 1:07:38.620
Richie, come here.

1:07:38.652 --> 1:07:40.055
We're gonna get it
rollin' and roasted.

1:07:40.087 --> 1:07:42.690
Listen, level with me.
Where's Boogie?

1:07:42.723 --> 1:07:43.859
I don't know.

1:07:43.892 --> 1:07:45.928
You told me he'll be here.

1:07:47.361 --> 1:07:49.830
Look, Coach, I'm here, a'ight?

1:07:49.864 --> 1:07:52.835
I can't speak for nobody else,
but I'm here, Coach.

1:08:08.549 --> 1:08:10.285
Get dressed.

1:08:15.723 --> 1:08:18.393
Boogie! Boogie!

1:08:18.425 --> 1:08:21.729
Boogie! Boogie! Boogie!

1:08:21.763 --> 1:08:24.099
Boogie! Boogie!

1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:33.375
Let's go.

1:08:33.407 --> 1:08:35.109
Alfred, what the hell
are you doing?

1:08:35.143 --> 1:08:36.812
Your deal with the CBA
strictly forbids you

1:08:36.845 --> 1:08:38.847
- from playing in this game.
- What deal?

1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:40.114
You should've
read the contract.

1:08:40.148 --> 1:08:41.882
He needs to play in this game.

1:08:41.916 --> 1:08:44.019
- What is he talking about?
- I just want to play ball.

1:08:44.051 --> 1:08:45.786
- He signed a deal.
- Hey, hey. Do you not speak English?

1:08:45.819 --> 1:08:47.688
- What'd he just say?
- I do. I... Wh-What's going on?

1:08:47.721 --> 1:08:49.690
- Relax. Take it easy.
- What are they talking about?

1:08:49.724 --> 1:08:50.892
Fellas,
wh-what's going on over here?

1:08:50.925 --> 1:08:52.794
Listen, we-we got
a game to play.

1:08:52.827 --> 1:08:54.563
- Listen, if you don't play on time, you forfeit.
- I know.

1:08:54.595 --> 1:08:56.063
We just need a couple
of minutes.

1:08:56.096 --> 1:08:57.799
Supposed to be in China.
That's what the problem is.

1:08:57.831 --> 1:08:59.401
- So?
- You signed the deal, right?

1:08:59.434 --> 1:09:00.802
Yo, so we playing?

1:09:00.835 --> 1:09:01.937
He can't play in this game.

1:09:01.970 --> 1:09:03.739
- Yo.
- What's going on?

1:09:03.772 --> 1:09:05.707
You here for me or Monk?

1:09:05.739 --> 1:09:07.876
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

1:09:07.908 --> 1:09:09.009
What's up, Juicy?

1:09:09.042 --> 1:09:10.612
I see you chose this egg roll.

1:09:10.644 --> 1:09:12.680
Shut the fuck up,
you big-head biscuit.

1:09:12.714 --> 1:09:14.716
Your sister give you
that busted-ass lineup?

1:09:14.748 --> 1:09:17.051
She always did talk a lot.

1:09:17.085 --> 1:09:19.388
All right, guys, come on,
back in the locker room.

1:09:22.556 --> 1:09:23.959
Let's get 'em, nigga.

1:09:30.165 --> 1:09:32.701
This game is disqualified!
Everybody!

1:09:32.733 --> 1:09:34.068
This team's supposed to be
in the locker room.

1:09:34.102 --> 1:09:36.171
I don't want to hear it.
Good. I don't care.

1:09:36.203 --> 1:09:39.073
This game is forfeited.
Let's go. Everybody out! Out!

1:09:39.107 --> 1:09:41.443
We'll settle this shit
at the Barracks.

1:09:42.777 --> 1:09:44.779
Whatever you want to do,
Wonton Soup.

1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:48.950
Xiao Ming, no! Xiao Ming!

1:09:48.983 --> 1:09:50.852
Enough.

1:09:50.885 --> 1:09:52.654
You made this always about you.

1:09:52.687 --> 1:09:55.056
You let the school down.
You let this team down.

1:09:58.026 --> 1:09:59.428
Saturday,
I'm-a be at your house.

1:10:00.662 --> 1:10:02.030
I'm-a be home.

1:10:10.938 --> 1:10:13.140
Yeah, a'ight.
Sound good. Sound good.

1:10:13.174 --> 1:10:14.643
Come on, come on.
Let's go! Let's go!

1:10:59.254 --> 1:11:00.823
<i>Xièxiè.</i>

1:12:11.893 --> 1:12:13.094
- One, two, three.
- Barracks!

1:12:13.126 --> 1:12:15.196
- Four, five, six.
- Shake it, baby.

1:12:23.004 --> 1:12:24.573
And we're off!

1:12:24.605 --> 1:12:27.175
Who will reign supreme?

1:12:27.207 --> 1:12:30.010
Who will be the king
of the Barracks?

1:12:30.044 --> 1:12:34.248
Who will be the coco bread
to Juicy's patty?

1:12:34.282 --> 1:12:35.918
Ew. Fucking pervert.

1:12:37.018 --> 1:12:38.920
A'ight, Boogie,
what are you gonna do?

1:12:41.188 --> 1:12:43.023
Oh, yeah, shorty.

1:12:43.056 --> 1:12:44.725
- That's-that's all you got?
- Yeah.

1:12:44.759 --> 1:12:46.261
Watch this. Look, look.

1:12:46.294 --> 1:12:49.131
A'ight, let's go. Bring it up.

1:12:51.698 --> 1:12:54.669
Look, look. You a baby. Look.

1:12:57.971 --> 1:12:59.107
Oh, there it is.

1:12:59.139 --> 1:13:00.642
Monk with the bucket.
Four-zip.

1:13:05.912 --> 1:13:06.880
- What you gonna do, Boogie?
- Trap, trap.

1:13:06.913 --> 1:13:09.084
- Oh, the trap.
- Richie!

1:13:09.117 --> 1:13:11.820
Bad pass. Guess who's there.

1:13:12.987 --> 1:13:14.022
Oh, Monk for two.

1:13:19.126 --> 1:13:20.761
Backdoor, Monk.

1:13:28.435 --> 1:13:30.337
Bring it up.

1:13:30.371 --> 1:13:33.075
Oh, Monk for three. Wow.

1:13:34.942 --> 1:13:36.310
That's two.

1:13:36.344 --> 1:13:37.846
Block that.

1:13:37.879 --> 1:13:39.381
Boogie on the layup.

1:13:45.086 --> 1:13:47.189
Oh, Monk for three.

1:13:48.790 --> 1:13:50.993
Hey, watch corner.

1:13:54.295 --> 1:13:57.297
Arthur looking
like food out here.

1:13:57.331 --> 1:13:58.800
Step back, cha-cha-ching!

1:14:00.334 --> 1:14:02.370
That's the first half, folks.

1:14:08.009 --> 1:14:10.111
Fuck basketball.

1:14:10.144 --> 1:14:12.914
Mm-hmm.
I might even quit ballplayers.

1:14:12.947 --> 1:14:14.716
They're exposing me.
I can't stop him.

1:14:14.748 --> 1:14:16.283
They're not exposing you.

1:14:16.317 --> 1:14:18.118
They're exposing the entire
right side of the zone.

1:14:18.152 --> 1:14:19.688
Just give us what you got.

1:14:21.456 --> 1:14:23.425
Look, let's play a box and one.

1:14:23.457 --> 1:14:25.192
You take Monk
at the top of the key.

1:14:25.225 --> 1:14:26.861
You'll have him one-on-one
like you always wanted.

1:14:26.894 --> 1:14:28.096
Coach, he's better than me.

1:14:28.129 --> 1:14:29.964
I don't want to play him
one-on-one.

1:14:29.996 --> 1:14:32.433
I want to win. You was the one
talking about team all year.

1:14:35.870 --> 1:14:38.038
I'll stop pushing buttons.

1:14:38.072 --> 1:14:39.373
Come on, man, let's go.

1:14:39.407 --> 1:14:40.875
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about!

1:14:40.907 --> 1:14:42.276
Dragons on three.

1:14:42.309 --> 1:14:44.278
- One, two, three.
- Dragons!

1:14:46.781 --> 1:14:48.116
- Oh, shit.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1:14:48.148 --> 1:14:49.817
- Let's do it. Get it.
- Let's go.

1:14:49.850 --> 1:14:51.053
You good?

1:14:52.854 --> 1:14:54.155
I'm good.

1:14:54.188 --> 1:14:55.890
Game's over.

1:14:55.922 --> 1:14:58.326
You got the game. It's over.

1:14:59.794 --> 1:15:01.095
Let's go, man.
Let's get this done.

1:15:08.301 --> 1:15:11.505
Oh! Boogie with the three.

1:15:11.538 --> 1:15:13.108
Hey, look out.

1:15:15.408 --> 1:15:18.013
Oh, Boogie off the rebound.

1:15:19.013 --> 1:15:20.247
Oh, there it is.

1:15:20.281 --> 1:15:21.882
Hey, yo, look.

1:15:22.950 --> 1:15:24.219
Lowe, throw...

1:15:24.251 --> 1:15:26.286
Give it up, bro.

1:15:26.319 --> 1:15:27.153
Look.

1:15:28.956 --> 1:15:31.059
Bro, what?
Yo, what are you doing, bro?

1:15:31.091 --> 1:15:32.426
Richie. Richie.

1:15:32.460 --> 1:15:34.196
- Oh, you want me to bring it up?
- Trust me.

1:15:37.898 --> 1:15:40.231
Hey, step up. Step up.

1:15:40.233 --> 1:15:41.935
Boom. Boogie with the bucket,

1:15:41.969 --> 1:15:44.038
pulling City Prep
within four, 50-46.

1:15:44.071 --> 1:15:45.907
They on a comeback.

1:15:47.308 --> 1:15:49.277
Richie with the bucket.

1:15:49.309 --> 1:15:50.879
Yo, you took my chair, B.

1:15:50.912 --> 1:15:52.213
You missed the whole
second half, man.

1:15:52.246 --> 1:15:53.848
I thought you ditched.

1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:55.916
I had to take a shit
in the bush. I got IBS.

1:15:55.950 --> 1:15:59.086
Harden step-back,
Cash App, cha-ching!

1:16:00.420 --> 1:16:02.923
Go, go, go, go, go.

1:16:02.956 --> 1:16:06.160
Ay! Boogie with the two,
pulling it closer.

1:16:12.465 --> 1:16:15.002
Pick up. Pick up.

1:16:15.036 --> 1:16:17.572
Richie for three. Splash!

1:16:17.604 --> 1:16:21.009
And with 57-52,
City Prep is creeping on 'em.

1:16:27.447 --> 1:16:29.316
He got one. He got one.

1:16:29.349 --> 1:16:30.384
Pick up. Pick up.

1:16:32.452 --> 1:16:33.554
I got you. I got you.

1:16:33.587 --> 1:16:35.823
Block party. Block party.

1:16:35.857 --> 1:16:37.192
That's two. A'ight.

1:16:37.224 --> 1:16:38.358
Let's go. Bring it up.

1:16:41.429 --> 1:16:43.864
Oh!

1:16:43.898 --> 1:16:45.867
Boogie on the layup.

1:16:47.934 --> 1:16:49.370
Yeah!

1:16:52.206 --> 1:16:53.975
Monk with the three.

1:16:54.007 --> 1:16:55.609
Two minutes left.

1:16:58.112 --> 1:16:59.614
Boogie with the put-back.

1:17:02.250 --> 1:17:03.451
City Prep is on a comeback.

1:17:03.483 --> 1:17:06.920
Barracks on top, 60-59.

1:17:06.953 --> 1:17:08.322
Set one. Set one.

1:17:08.355 --> 1:17:10.558
Passes it off, top of the key.

1:17:10.590 --> 1:17:12.059
Oh.

1:17:14.028 --> 1:17:16.297
Oh, long range.

1:17:16.330 --> 1:17:19.300
Chicken and Cashew Nuts
puts the Dragons up two.

1:17:19.332 --> 1:17:22.336
Good gracious. City Prep
With their first lead.

1:17:22.370 --> 1:17:23.872
Come on. Clear out. Clear out.

1:17:23.904 --> 1:17:25.206
Clear what out?

1:17:25.238 --> 1:17:27.875
- I'm going left.
- Go wherever you want.

1:17:27.908 --> 1:17:30.411
Richie taking it to the box.

1:17:30.443 --> 1:17:32.880
Oh! He just showing it off!

1:17:34.180 --> 1:17:35.884
What? Where's the foul?

1:17:35.916 --> 1:17:37.417
Where's the foul?

1:17:37.451 --> 1:17:39.220
- Where's the foul?
- He got him with the body.

1:17:39.252 --> 1:17:40.889
Stop crying, little ninja.

1:17:40.921 --> 1:17:43.190
- Well, that chain weighing you down.
- Yeah, a'ight.

1:17:45.059 --> 1:17:47.161
Still 62-60.

1:17:47.193 --> 1:17:49.062
You know that shit
ain't no foul.

1:17:49.095 --> 1:17:50.297
More like a love tap.

1:17:50.331 --> 1:17:51.565
Yeah, that soft shit.

1:17:53.367 --> 1:17:55.270
I wasn't soft
when I was in Juicy.

1:17:55.303 --> 1:17:57.639
Cut the shit out, fellas.
18 seconds left in the game.

1:17:57.671 --> 1:17:59.907
Let's go.

1:18:04.412 --> 1:18:06.581
Oh, we all get lucky.

1:18:06.613 --> 1:18:08.683
Don't worry about 'em.

1:18:08.715 --> 1:18:11.118
Cute-ass nigga. Watch this.

1:18:15.022 --> 1:18:17.492
It's all tied up, 62-62.

1:18:17.524 --> 1:18:18.625
18 seconds left in the game.

1:18:18.658 --> 1:18:20.027
Come on, come on, come on.

1:18:20.060 --> 1:18:21.328
Hey, what you gonna do?

1:18:21.362 --> 1:18:23.531
- Yo, Richie.
- What you gonna do now?

1:18:23.563 --> 1:18:25.566
What you gonna do now?

1:18:27.100 --> 1:18:29.304
You better off
taking it yourself.

1:18:29.336 --> 1:18:31.305
Do something with it.

1:18:34.075 --> 1:18:36.176
- Told you.
- Oh, don't let Boogie get it.

1:18:36.210 --> 1:18:37.979
Got him.

1:18:38.011 --> 1:18:39.246
Hey, step up.

1:18:39.279 --> 1:18:41.081
Boogie with the slam!

1:18:41.114 --> 1:18:44.719
City Prep up 64-62
with seconds left.

1:18:56.263 --> 1:18:58.366
Pick up that D!

1:19:01.068 --> 1:19:02.370
Ball game, fellas.

1:19:02.403 --> 1:19:05.139
City Prep wins, 64 to 62.

1:19:21.488 --> 1:19:23.424
That's it. The Dragons win.

1:20:15.809 --> 1:20:17.644
Yo, you good, bro?

1:20:19.279 --> 1:20:20.747
Yeah, we good.

1:20:20.781 --> 1:20:22.649
Chin, what up?

1:20:25.419 --> 1:20:28.256
- First one's for free.
- Yeah?

1:20:28.288 --> 1:20:30.724
- We gonna see you again.
- Mm-hmm.

1:21:02.523 --> 1:21:05.226
<i>So, let me get this straight.</i>

1:21:05.259 --> 1:21:08.162
- <i>You got a D1 scholarship?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1:21:08.194 --> 1:21:11.532
<i>It wasn't to a top ten,
but I got one.</i>

1:21:13.134 --> 1:21:14.702
Mm. Let me pour.

1:21:14.734 --> 1:21:16.470
I'm the youngest.

1:21:18.572 --> 1:21:22.444
My parents took it hard, too,
so I didn't say anything.

1:21:23.443 --> 1:21:24.711
Feel that.

1:21:31.719 --> 1:21:34.122
Only Holden Caulfield would
give his parents an invoice.

1:21:35.622 --> 1:21:37.357
You feel me?

1:21:39.260 --> 1:21:41.829
So, when were you gonna
tell me about China?

1:21:41.862 --> 1:21:43.898
I didn't think
you cared about China.

1:21:43.930 --> 1:21:46.468
- Don't be like that.
- Be like what?

1:21:47.701 --> 1:21:50.171
Monk happened before I met you.

1:21:50.203 --> 1:21:51.671
You can't hold that against me.

1:21:51.705 --> 1:21:53.774
- You lied to me.
- I did not lie.

1:21:53.806 --> 1:21:55.175
You knew it would hurt me.

1:21:55.209 --> 1:21:56.844
You didn't tell me about China.

1:21:56.876 --> 1:21:58.745
Fuck it, then.
We're both liars.

1:21:58.778 --> 1:22:00.680
Why are you doing this to me?

1:22:00.714 --> 1:22:02.582
People are doing it to me.

1:22:02.616 --> 1:22:04.318
I did everything
I'm supposed to,

1:22:04.350 --> 1:22:05.752
and I'm still being sent
to China.

1:22:05.786 --> 1:22:07.388
Shit happens to everybody.

1:22:07.420 --> 1:22:08.922
You can't keep feeling bad
for yourself.

1:22:08.956 --> 1:22:10.625
China could be a real blessing.

1:22:10.657 --> 1:22:12.225
A blessing without you.

1:22:12.259 --> 1:22:14.295
China is
an amazing opportunity,

1:22:14.327 --> 1:22:16.229
but it isn't shit without you.

1:22:16.263 --> 1:22:17.631
I love you.

1:22:20.701 --> 1:22:22.437
You mean it?

1:22:24.638 --> 1:22:27.475
I really mean it.

1:22:29.742 --> 1:22:32.446
You still want
to hear about dolphins?

1:22:32.479 --> 1:22:34.215
Yeah.

1:22:35.582 --> 1:22:38.685
When I was a little kid,
my parents took me to SeaWorld,

1:22:38.719 --> 1:22:41.689
and I saw these dolphins
with flawless skin,

1:22:41.721 --> 1:22:43.757
and I thought,
"Those are dolphins."

1:22:43.791 --> 1:22:46.928
But when I was 15,
we went back to Trinidad,

1:22:46.961 --> 1:22:49.463
and we saw these wild dolphins
in a pod.

1:22:49.496 --> 1:22:51.299
So I jumped off the boat,

1:22:51.331 --> 1:22:53.667
and everybody thought I was
buggin', but I didn't care.

1:22:53.701 --> 1:22:55.469
And I swim toward the pod,

1:22:55.501 --> 1:22:58.738
and there's these dolphins
around me just swirling.

1:22:58.772 --> 1:23:01.341
But they're not like
the dolphins at SeaWorld.

1:23:02.542 --> 1:23:05.279
I look down,
and they all got buck-50s.

1:23:06.647 --> 1:23:09.483
They're all scarred,
but they're...

1:23:09.515 --> 1:23:14.487
still chirping, swimming,

1:23:14.520 --> 1:23:19.359
living like the dolphins
at SeaWorld will never know.

1:23:26.267 --> 1:23:28.368
Never know.

1:23:30.703 --> 1:23:32.739
You cut me.

1:23:41.948 --> 1:23:43.984
But we wild.

1:23:45.919 --> 1:23:47.956
And we still here.
