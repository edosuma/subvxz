Titian was born in 1488

00:34.700 --> 00:39.156
and died in 1576,
living well into his eighties.

00:39.158 --> 00:41.239
He was the undisputed master

00:41.241 --> 00:44.989
of Venetian painting
for 60 years.

00:44.991 --> 00:47.656
And his contemporaries
alluded to him

00:47.658 --> 00:48.906
as the sun amidst the stars,

00:48.908 --> 00:52.073
which is the final line
in Dante's Paradiso.

00:52.075 --> 00:56.114
You can see how beautifully
he uses and applies colour,

00:56.116 --> 00:57.531
a characteristic of his work,

00:57.533 --> 01:00.781
which held him in pre-eminence
through the High Renaissance

01:00.783 --> 01:04.697
and arguably cast him
as the greatest painter

01:04.700 --> 01:05.698
in Western art.

01:05.700 --> 01:11.783
Erm, excuse me, sir. Erm,
you mustn't touch the paintings.

01:11.950 --> 01:13.698
Er, excuse me?

01:13.700 --> 01:15.073
Sir, are you OK?

01:15.075 --> 01:18.239
Erm, excuse me,
can someone help us, please?

02:09.032 --> 02:12.906
Pills, ecstasy, blow?
What do you want, fella?

02:12.908 --> 02:13.781
I'm all right, thanks.

02:13.783 --> 02:16.448
Looking for some company
tonight, darling?

02:16.450 --> 02:18.489
No, I'm looking
for a place to stay.

02:18.491 --> 02:22.198
Come on, handsome.
Don't be shy.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.531
What you doing here?

02:44.533 --> 02:45.948
I'm just sitting down
for a minute.

02:45.950 --> 02:50.283
- Why, is there a problem?
- You didn't read the sign?

02:51.408 --> 02:52.198
Sorry, mate, rules is rules.

02:52.200 --> 02:56.323
Where I come from, people are
a little bit more friendly.

02:56.325 --> 02:57.364
Do me a favour

02:57.366 --> 03:00.031
and spare me that
old chirpy Northern routine.

03:00.033 --> 03:02.823
- I've got work to do.
- I'm from Essex.

03:02.825 --> 03:07.700
Listen, wherever you're from,
you ain't from round here.

03:10.575 --> 03:11.531
Let me guess.

03:11.533 --> 03:14.448
You were brought up
in the back of beyond.

03:14.450 --> 03:17.531
In many ways,
it was an idyllic existence.

03:17.533 --> 03:19.948
Really, you were bored shitless.

03:19.950 --> 03:23.114
One fine day,
you had a brainwave.

03:23.116 --> 03:24.489
"Move to London," you said.

03:24.491 --> 03:25.323
"Make my fortune."

03:25.325 --> 03:28.323
I did say that.
I said it to my dad.

03:28.325 --> 03:29.448
You actually used those words?

03:29.450 --> 03:34.239
- Sort of, yeah.
- Fuck me. What did he say?

03:34.241 --> 03:36.989
If you ask me,
you're spending too much time

03:36.991 --> 03:38.031
on that bloody computer.

03:38.033 --> 03:39.573
Getting all these fancy ideas.

03:39.575 --> 03:41.323
No use trying to talk me
out of it, Dad.

03:41.325 --> 03:42.906
My mind's made up.
I'm leaving tonight.

03:42.908 --> 03:45.739
Tonight?

03:45.741 --> 03:47.448
Look, I've bought my ticket.

03:47.450 --> 03:48.614
Well, what about your education?

03:48.616 --> 03:52.406
Don't you see?
Thiswillbe my education.

03:52.408 --> 03:54.823
Streets of London,
full of musicians and artists.

03:54.825 --> 03:58.281
Piss artists, more like.
You'll meet plenty of those.

03:59.825 --> 04:02.281
Sometimes, as I lay in bed
at night,

04:02.283 --> 04:05.531
I imagine a world
beyond these four walls.

04:05.533 --> 04:08.073
A world full of mystery
and possibilities.

04:08.075 --> 04:11.198
Oh, never you mind
about mystery and possibilities.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.114
What are we supposed to do

04:12.116 --> 04:14.448
while you're busy
gallivanting around Soho

04:14.450 --> 04:15.739
till gawd knows what time, eh?

04:15.741 --> 04:18.947
- Your mum will be worried sick.
- He'll be all right.

04:18.950 --> 04:21.113
As long as you don't speak
to strange boys

04:21.116 --> 04:23.281
sleeping rough
in dark alleyways.

04:23.283 --> 04:26.698
And with that,
they gave me their blessing.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.906
Oh, fuck their blessing.
Did they give you any money?

04:29.908 --> 04:32.531
Of course they did.
I'm their only son.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.114
All right. Hand it over.

04:34.116 --> 04:35.531
Why should I hand it over?

04:35.533 --> 04:38.739
Right, this may come
as a surprise to you, yeah?

04:38.741 --> 04:42.406
The streets of London
ain't paved in gold.

04:42.408 --> 04:43.739
They're as cold as ice,

04:43.741 --> 04:46.239
they stink of piss,
and they're full of villains.

04:46.241 --> 04:50.366
So basically,
it's every man for himself.

04:52.408 --> 04:55.239
All right,
you've talked me into it.

04:55.241 --> 04:59.281
You should stay here,
strictly on a temporary basis.

04:59.283 --> 05:01.489
Just till I get myself sorted.

05:01.491 --> 05:03.573
Ten quid a night.

05:03.575 --> 05:05.114
You can't charge someone
ten quid

05:05.116 --> 05:07.658
to sleep in a cardboard box.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.700
Why not?

06:08.575 --> 06:10.948
I think you just met
your first villain.

06:10.950 --> 06:12.656
What the fuck am I gonna do now?

06:12.658 --> 06:15.031
Hang on.
I'm just getting to that.

06:15.033 --> 06:18.073
Right. Now, I'm as open-minded
as the next man.

06:18.075 --> 06:21.489
Your sexuality's
none of my business.

06:21.491 --> 06:23.739
If I was you...

06:23.741 --> 06:26.114
...I'd show my face
in that bar over there.

06:26.116 --> 06:30.825
Trust me, you won't be skint
for long.

06:36.033 --> 06:37.656
Thanks. I'll see you around.

06:37.658 --> 06:42.366
Yeah, sure.
That's what they all say.

06:45.366 --> 06:50.616
You mark my words. That bloke
ain't gonna last five minutes.

06:51.366 --> 06:54.073
Yes, but the thing I love
about Velázquez the most

06:54.075 --> 06:57.989
is the way he paints the spaces
in between objects.

06:57.991 --> 06:58.656
I know what you mean.

06:58.658 --> 07:02.489
Somehow he makes the object
become more real,

07:02.491 --> 07:03.989
a lot more intense.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.906
Yes. In the way, like,

07:05.908 --> 07:08.531
he illuminates
the space between them.

07:08.533 --> 07:10.073
The man was a genius.

07:10.075 --> 07:15.783
- The painter's painter.
- Hold on a minute.

07:17.783 --> 07:20.658
Do you see what I see?

07:22.533 --> 07:24.489
What are you doing here?

07:24.491 --> 07:28.156
I'm searching for a world full
of mystery and possibilities.

07:28.158 --> 07:31.156
Good. Then you've come
to the right place.

07:31.158 --> 07:32.698
You've heard of Velázquez?

07:32.700 --> 07:36.573
No, I haven't, actually.
Is he a mate of yours?

07:36.575 --> 07:38.364
He was the painter of twilights.

07:38.366 --> 07:39.531
Oh, good for him.

07:39.533 --> 07:42.364
- Of infinity.
- Even better.

07:42.366 --> 07:44.364
Of silence.

07:44.366 --> 07:46.950
I don't know what that means.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.114
You gonna tell me what you want
or do I have to guess?

08:14.116 --> 08:16.364
Good evening. Erm...

08:16.366 --> 08:19.948
I've just moved into the area
and I'm looking for a job.

08:19.950 --> 08:23.198
I'll wash pots, clean.
I'll do anything, really.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.989
Does this look like
a job centre to you?

08:25.991 --> 08:27.114
No, it doesn't but...

08:27.116 --> 08:30.031
It's a bar which serves alcohol.

08:30.033 --> 08:31.198
Don't tell me your life story,

08:31.200 --> 08:33.073
just tell me
what you want to drink.

08:33.075 --> 08:38.991
Sorry. I'll have a bottle
of beer, please.

08:51.950 --> 08:56.448
Go on, then. Ask me the question
you've been meaning to ask me

08:56.450 --> 09:00.158
ever since
you walked in the door.

09:02.200 --> 09:06.533
Why are barmaids in London
so unfriendly?

09:22.616 --> 09:24.989
Well, if I had a pound coin

09:24.991 --> 09:26.073
for every time a pretty boy

09:26.075 --> 09:28.406
came in here feeling sorry
for himself,

09:28.408 --> 09:30.989
I wouldn't be pulling pints
for a living.

09:30.991 --> 09:33.825
I can tell you that for nothing.

09:34.075 --> 09:36.575
You need to toughen up.

09:37.491 --> 09:41.156
- I do?
- Yeah, you do.

09:41.158 --> 09:44.450
You're young, you're fit.

09:44.658 --> 09:46.073
You have the face of an angel.

09:46.075 --> 09:50.200
You'll have plenty of friends
soon enough.

09:58.450 --> 10:01.033
I hope so.

10:47.408 --> 10:48.198
David.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.239
- Marcello.
- Jesus.

10:50.241 --> 10:51.864
- Victor.
- Jim.

10:51.866 --> 10:55.366
I think I just met you guys
outside.

10:56.616 --> 10:57.448
Come here often?

10:57.450 --> 11:01.116
Are you lot thinking
what I'm thinking?

11:01.533 --> 11:02.198
What are you thinking?

11:02.200 --> 11:04.698
I'm thinking about
a beautiful painting

11:04.700 --> 11:05.364
in the National Gallery.

11:05.366 --> 11:07.531
It's on the first floor.
You go up the stairs,

11:07.533 --> 11:09.323
take a sharp left
into the second room

11:09.325 --> 11:11.698
and it's the third one along
on the right.

11:11.700 --> 11:12.906
I know exactly what you mean.

11:12.908 --> 11:14.698
I wish I did.
Please stop doing that.

11:14.700 --> 11:18.614
He could have stepped out
of a Caravaggio.

11:18.616 --> 11:19.739
That name rings a bell.

11:19.741 --> 11:22.658
You ever heard
of personal space?

11:23.033 --> 11:24.698
I saw the vacancy in the window.

11:24.700 --> 11:27.114
- How old are you, Jim?
- Eighteen.

11:27.116 --> 11:30.114
Er... 21. I'm looking for a job.

11:30.116 --> 11:33.864
This is not a job.
This is a vocation.

11:35.575 --> 11:37.156
I'm not sure what that means.

11:37.158 --> 11:41.533
Excuse me for a minute
while I just run to the toilet.

11:49.825 --> 11:53.656
I think he's the one
we've been looking for.

11:53.658 --> 11:56.031
"Vocation:
A strong desire to pursue

11:56.033 --> 12:00.823
or a particular liking
for a special vocation."

12:00.825 --> 12:03.531
"Vocation:
A strong desire to pursue

12:03.533 --> 12:07.491
or a natural liking
for a particular vocation."

12:16.116 --> 12:17.156
It was great meeting you lads.

12:17.158 --> 12:20.114
I'll definitely think
about what you said.

12:20.116 --> 12:21.448
Are you trying to get me drunk?

12:21.450 --> 12:24.989
No disrespect,
but you're a small-town boy.

12:24.991 --> 12:25.948
And this is a big city.

12:25.950 --> 12:28.406
Don't worry about me.
I can look after myself.

12:28.408 --> 12:29.489
How are you gonna survive?

12:29.491 --> 12:32.906
Like I said, I'll find a job
and I've got my savings.

12:32.908 --> 12:36.031
The wallet you left on the table
looks pretty empty to me.

12:36.033 --> 12:39.406
Look, we've all sat
where you're sitting now.

12:39.408 --> 12:41.739
We understand the anxiety.

12:41.741 --> 12:42.614
I'm not anxious, I'm just...

12:42.616 --> 12:47.158
wondering what it is you lot
actually do for a living.

12:55.825 --> 12:58.908
Sexy Boys Raconteurs.

12:59.783 --> 13:02.239
Now I know what it is
you're talking about.

13:02.241 --> 13:02.906
With the right training,

13:02.908 --> 13:05.489
you could go a long way
in this business.

13:05.491 --> 13:10.406
I'll have to think about it.
If it's what I wanna do, I mean.

13:10.408 --> 13:13.781
I was hoping to find something
a little more creative.

13:13.783 --> 13:14.864
This is creative.

13:14.866 --> 13:17.531
Some of the finest actors
of their generation

13:17.533 --> 13:19.781
have played the role
you're about to play.

13:19.783 --> 13:22.489
- River Phoenix.
- Keanu Reeves.

13:22.491 --> 13:24.239
Joe Dallesandro.

13:24.241 --> 13:26.656
I need to get back in the gym.

13:26.658 --> 13:28.198
What is a Raconteur, by the way?

13:28.200 --> 13:33.575
I'll explain everything. First
I want to show you something.

13:34.991 --> 13:39.573
I love London. It's the best
city in the whole fucking world.

13:39.575 --> 13:40.656
And it belongs to us.

13:40.658 --> 13:42.948
It does look great tonight,
I must admit.

13:42.950 --> 13:44.906
All the cool people
come out at night.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.906
Writers, artists,
queers, whores.

13:46.908 --> 13:50.239
It belongs to us
and we can do whatever we want.

13:50.241 --> 13:51.156
That's why I came here.

13:51.158 --> 13:54.614
I've been dreaming of walking
these streets since I was a kid.

13:54.616 --> 13:55.698
And all of it could be yours.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.448
And forget about that
boring shit you left behind.

13:58.450 --> 14:01.406
Just dream about
who you wanna be.

14:01.408 --> 14:05.864
Come on.
Let me buy you another drink.

14:05.866 --> 14:08.781
What do you think is the most
difficult thing about sex?

14:08.783 --> 14:11.281
I dunno. What to say
to the person afterwards?

14:11.283 --> 14:13.656
You've hit the nail
on the head.

14:13.658 --> 14:14.031
Have I?

14:14.033 --> 14:17.323
In a society as atomised
as ours, people crave intimacy.

14:17.325 --> 14:19.989
And that's the service
we provide.

14:19.991 --> 14:20.614
What about the sex?

14:20.616 --> 14:22.614
The sex is the easy part.
And we enjoy it.

14:22.616 --> 14:25.364
But our speciality
is what comes afterwards.

14:25.366 --> 14:26.989
You mean smoking a cigarette?

14:26.991 --> 14:28.448
I mean post-coital conversation.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.239
I've not had
much experience in that,

14:30.241 --> 14:31.323
but I'm as horny
as the next man.

14:31.325 --> 14:34.031
Intellectual debate.
Exchange of ideas.

14:34.033 --> 14:35.781
That's what the world
is crying out for.

14:35.783 --> 14:38.948
Like, cheap hookers standing
on street corners

14:38.950 --> 14:39.823
are a thing of the past.

14:39.825 --> 14:40.906
Not where I'm from they're not.

14:40.908 --> 14:43.906
Our clients want to talk about
a novel they once read,

14:43.908 --> 14:46.198
a painting they once saw
in a gallery.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.364
People wanna be inspired by art.

14:48.366 --> 14:51.114
- They wanna be uplifted.
- I'll do it.

14:51.116 --> 14:51.948
I'll do some uplifting.

14:51.950 --> 14:55.489
I knew you were one of us
as soon as I saw you.

14:55.491 --> 14:59.656
First off, we need a profile.
We'll sort that tomorrow.

14:59.658 --> 15:01.156
And a supply of condoms.

15:01.158 --> 15:03.739
Who's your favourite artist?

15:03.741 --> 15:06.031
I saw a painting
by Caravaggio once.

15:06.033 --> 15:08.156
Caravaggio is a great place
to start.

15:08.158 --> 15:12.866
He's raw, he's sexy,
and he painted people like us.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.906
We work at the high end
of the market.

15:14.908 --> 15:17.656
Art dealers, politicians,
senior clergy.

15:17.658 --> 15:18.448
These people are educated,

15:18.450 --> 15:20.781
so you need to know your Goya
from your Gauguin,

15:20.783 --> 15:22.198
your Fritz Lang
from your Fassbinder.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.656
Rainer Werner Fassbinder,
prolific German film-maker.

15:25.658 --> 15:29.031
A genius, destroyed
by years of sex, drugs

15:29.033 --> 15:30.198
and cheap Russian vodka.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.073
Greatest achievement?

15:32.075 --> 15:33.614
Fear Eats the Soul.

15:33.616 --> 15:36.031
Social media
is a definite no-no.

15:36.033 --> 15:37.073
People wanna suck your cock.

15:37.075 --> 15:39.406
They don't care
what you had for breakfast.

15:39.408 --> 15:40.364
I'm liking the sound of this.

15:40.366 --> 15:42.364
Our clients are of
an older generation,

15:42.366 --> 15:45.823
so the less you can bang on
about technology, the better.

15:45.825 --> 15:48.406
Some of them will remember Soho
in its heyday.

15:48.408 --> 15:49.864
Bet they've got
some great stories.

15:49.866 --> 15:53.198
Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud,
The Colony Rooms.

15:53.200 --> 15:53.989
A word of warning.

15:53.991 --> 15:55.906
There's always gonna be
some fresh-faced kid

15:55.908 --> 15:57.906
trying to take your place
in the spotlight.

15:57.908 --> 16:01.114
Someone with a bigger dick
and a nicer smile.

16:01.116 --> 16:03.614
So get to bed early
on a school night

16:03.616 --> 16:05.948
and keep drug-taking
to a minimum.

16:05.950 --> 16:08.031
Am I allowed
the occasional spliff?

16:08.033 --> 16:09.364
Well, everything in moderation.

16:09.366 --> 16:12.323
But remember,
we're a bit like athletes.

16:12.325 --> 16:13.198
It's important we stay fit.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.948
Potentially we earn shitloads of
money and then we retire early.

16:16.950 --> 16:20.364
You've got five years
in this game, tops.

16:20.366 --> 16:22.864
Didn't realise being a rent boy
was so complicated.

16:22.866 --> 16:27.323
Place your hand on this packet
of condoms and repeat after me:

16:27.325 --> 16:31.573
"We're the oldest profession and
we take pride in what we do."

16:31.575 --> 16:35.781
We're the oldest profession
and we take pride in what we do.

16:35.783 --> 16:36.406
"Our sacred mission

16:36.408 --> 16:39.281
is to drag male prostitution
into the 21st century,

16:39.283 --> 16:43.906
whilst paying homage
to the artists who came before."

16:43.908 --> 16:44.489
Our sacred mission

16:44.491 --> 16:47.364
is to drag male prostitution
into the 21st century,

16:47.366 --> 16:51.406
whilst paying homage to the
artists who've gone before.

16:51.408 --> 16:53.825
"So help me God."

16:54.866 --> 16:57.325
I'm only joking.

16:57.491 --> 16:59.531
Welcome to Soho.

16:59.533 --> 17:03.114
- I do have one more question.
- Go on.

17:03.116 --> 17:04.864
So why are all
these successful blokes

17:04.866 --> 17:09.825
paying teenage prostitutes
for intellectual stimulation?

17:10.325 --> 17:11.489
I dunno.

17:11.491 --> 17:14.700
Maybe they're not getting it
at home.

17:15.407 --> 17:17.741
Hmm!

17:27.200 --> 17:30.281
We were normal teenagers once.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.364
- Obsessed by football.
- Sex.

17:31.366 --> 17:33.614
- Mobile phones.
- Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim.

17:33.616 --> 17:34.614
Hold it there for a second.

17:34.616 --> 17:37.031
- But something was missing.
- We craved the big city.

17:37.033 --> 17:40.198
- The bright lights.
- There were five of us once.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.031
What happened
to the previous lad?

17:42.033 --> 17:43.989
Hold it there for a second.

17:43.991 --> 17:46.698
He was beautiful
but he met a terrible fate.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.406
Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?
Did he die?

17:48.408 --> 17:51.281
It's worse than that.
He went to work in the City.

17:51.283 --> 17:52.989
Hold it there, Jim. Perfect.

17:52.991 --> 17:57.781
All he cared about was money.
And his politics were... dodgy.

17:57.783 --> 18:00.073
Well, beauty can't last forever,
can it?

18:00.075 --> 18:01.031
Tell that to Cleopatra.

18:01.033 --> 18:03.406
From what I've read,
Cleopatra was really fit.

18:03.408 --> 18:04.698
Hold it, Jim.

18:04.700 --> 18:08.156
Actually, according
to the latest academic reports,

18:08.158 --> 18:09.156
Cleopatra was a minger.

18:09.158 --> 18:12.323
Liz Taylor's 1963 performance
notwithstanding.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.781
Listen, Cleopatra
was no oil painting.

18:14.783 --> 18:17.656
She knew how to play
those rumours.

18:17.658 --> 18:19.698
Caesar preferred boys.

18:19.700 --> 18:20.989
How do you know all of this?

18:20.991 --> 18:22.864
While the rest of our generation

18:22.866 --> 18:25.114
was shoving drugs
down their neck,

18:25.116 --> 18:25.823
we were reading books.

18:25.825 --> 18:28.531
OK, Jim, it's time
to show me the money.

18:28.533 --> 18:30.531
The... money?
I though we agreed...

18:30.533 --> 18:32.031
The money means your cock.

18:32.033 --> 18:35.323
- Oh.
- I need a picture of your cock.

18:35.325 --> 18:38.700
Yeah, no worries.

18:45.408 --> 18:47.031
Is everything OK?

18:47.033 --> 18:50.116
Everything's more than OK.

18:53.575 --> 18:53.864
Wow.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.656
I've worked with
some handsome blokes in my time

18:56.658 --> 18:59.948
but this kid...
this kid is something special.

18:59.950 --> 19:02.700
I mean, the camera loves him.

19:06.533 --> 19:08.739
We will teach you
everything that we know.

19:08.741 --> 19:10.281
Yeah,
but where do we start?

19:10.283 --> 19:12.906
Given me a headache
just thinking about it.

19:12.908 --> 19:14.573
We'll start with Caravaggio,

19:14.575 --> 19:17.031
then work our way back
to the ancients.

19:17.033 --> 19:18.239
Art, poetry, literature.

19:18.241 --> 19:20.406
There's a lot to learn
and we don't have much time.

19:20.408 --> 19:22.573
Yeah, but for now
we'll stick to the basics.

19:22.575 --> 19:24.739
To be honest,
that's the part of the job

19:24.741 --> 19:26.073
that worries me the most.

19:26.075 --> 19:27.364
I've had some trouble
in the past.

19:27.366 --> 19:31.531
Forget about the past.
You're one of us now.

19:31.533 --> 19:35.075
And I've got a good feeling
about you.

19:40.325 --> 19:43.031
"Police records
show that in May 1606,

19:43.033 --> 19:47.198
Caravaggio killed the gangster
Ranuccio Tomassoni in a duel."

19:47.200 --> 19:51.323
"The painter fled Rome at night
and made his way to Naples,

19:51.325 --> 19:56.033
where he sought the protection
of the Colonna family."

20:07.950 --> 20:11.114
"On a grey morning
in November 1975,

20:11.116 --> 20:14.489
the cold, lifeless body
of Pier Paolo Pasolini

20:14.491 --> 20:19.073
was discovered on the beach
at Ostia, outside Rome."

20:19.075 --> 20:22.531
"The poet had been murdered,
so we lost a poet..."

20:22.533 --> 20:25.406
"As he walked along the shore
that night,

20:25.408 --> 20:27.531
looking for the company
of strangers,

20:27.533 --> 20:31.073
did Pasolini ponder
the violent life of Caravaggio?"

20:31.075 --> 20:34.906
"Did he imagine young men
lurking in the shadows..."

20:34.908 --> 20:38.239
"As a student, Oscar Wilde
saw the great painting

20:38.241 --> 20:40.406
of Saint Sebastian
by Guido Reni."

20:40.408 --> 20:43.239
"The beautiful image
overwhelmed him."

20:43.241 --> 20:45.323
"It brought tears
to his eyes..."

20:45.325 --> 20:47.406
"Did this Irish Sebastian

20:47.408 --> 20:50.073
imagine Caravaggio
in the alleyways of Rome,

20:50.075 --> 20:53.573
searching for the beggars
and prostitutes

20:53.575 --> 20:56.906
to people
his religious painting?"

20:56.908 --> 20:58.489
"Perhaps...

20:58.491 --> 21:01.823
...perhaps he imagined himself
as a beautiful work of art..."

21:01.825 --> 21:04.573
"Legend has it
that Francis Bacon

21:04.575 --> 21:06.114
and George Dyer became lovers

21:06.116 --> 21:09.948
after George,
a petty thief from the East End,

21:09.950 --> 21:15.116
broke into Bacon's studio
in the dead of night."

21:54.533 --> 21:55.198
You sure you're ready?

21:55.200 --> 21:58.323
I can't study for ever. I need
to get out there and practise.

21:58.325 --> 22:01.364
- Go on, ask me a question.
- OK.

22:01.366 --> 22:02.573
So a bloke calls up

22:02.575 --> 22:05.406
and says Caravaggio gives
him a massive hard-on.

22:05.408 --> 22:06.198
But he likes it a bit rough,

22:06.200 --> 22:09.906
so he's not so keen on all those
pretty boys he painted in Rome

22:09.908 --> 22:11.323
at the beginning of his career.

22:11.325 --> 22:16.700
He wants something...
darker, more edgy.

22:17.533 --> 22:18.239
After a couple of drinks,

22:18.241 --> 22:21.573
I'd probably introduce him
to the Flagellation of Christ,

22:21.575 --> 22:22.614
painted in Naples, 1607.

22:22.616 --> 22:24.989
Caravaggio's on the run
after committing murder.

22:24.991 --> 22:27.406
He's tired, he's sick,
he's a bit paranoid.

22:27.408 --> 22:29.031
I like where you're going
with this.

22:29.033 --> 22:31.739
It's the perfect example
of his late period.

22:31.741 --> 22:32.489
The lighting is dramatic.

22:32.491 --> 22:34.906
Christ's tortured body
is lit in a singular spotlight.

22:34.908 --> 22:39.448
The other muscular figures
appear from deep, dark shadows.

22:39.450 --> 22:41.698
Good work.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.616
I'm impressed.

22:43.825 --> 22:45.489
Thanks.

22:45.491 --> 22:48.031
I bet there are a number
of distinguished gentlemen

22:48.033 --> 22:50.614
struggling to get through
even as we speak.

22:50.616 --> 22:55.241
- You think so?
- I know so.

23:07.991 --> 23:10.989
Hello? I moved to London.

23:10.991 --> 23:13.364
I saw you
in a photograph.

23:13.366 --> 23:15.156
I've never done this before.

23:15.158 --> 23:17.156
"Fit Lad with Basket of Fruit."

23:17.158 --> 23:18.239
I can be with you tonight.

23:18.241 --> 23:21.573
- I called you straight away.
- Anything is possible.

23:21.575 --> 23:25.531
- I couldn't wait any longer.
- If you have the money.

23:25.533 --> 23:26.948
I want you...

23:26.950 --> 23:29.450
Nothing is a problem.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.408
...so badly.

23:38.450 --> 23:41.073
Sorry, I can't stop staring
at you.

23:41.075 --> 23:44.948
- I'm making you uncomfortable.
- Little bit, yeah.

23:44.950 --> 23:47.156
As I was saying,
do you prefer Goya or Gauguin?

23:47.158 --> 23:50.489
- Fritz Lang or Fassbinder?
- You've completely lost me.

23:50.491 --> 23:54.448
I'm just trying to figure out
which kind of things you prefer.

23:54.450 --> 23:55.489
Are you on drugs?

23:55.491 --> 23:58.406
I don't do drugs.
My body's a temple.

23:58.408 --> 23:59.781
Oh, I can see that.

23:59.783 --> 24:02.489
But, please, just try
and relax a little bit.

24:02.491 --> 24:03.406
You seem very tense.

24:03.408 --> 24:08.823
Sorry. You're my first client
and it's hard to relax in here.

24:08.825 --> 24:11.406
My mates tell me you're writing
a book on Caravaggio.

24:11.408 --> 24:15.739
Yes. And I saw that
you had an interest.

24:15.741 --> 24:19.698
But that's not the only reason
I invited you out, Jim.

24:19.700 --> 24:22.406
And please don't feel you need
to keep talking for my sake.

24:22.408 --> 24:28.573
I'm a Raconteur. Talking's
what I do. Amongst other things.

24:28.575 --> 24:32.656
I appreciate the irony,
I really do.

24:32.658 --> 24:36.033
But I saw your picture and...

24:36.950 --> 24:39.823
...you are probably one of
the most beautiful men

24:39.825 --> 24:41.864
I have ever seen.

24:41.866 --> 24:44.116
Thanks very much.

24:44.450 --> 24:45.448
When I first saw your picture

24:45.450 --> 24:50.406
I... was reminded of
a young man in a painting and...

24:50.408 --> 24:53.531
- I wanted to show it to you.
- Don't tell me.

24:53.533 --> 24:56.156
It's on the first floor,
up the stairs,

24:56.158 --> 24:57.531
sharp left into the second room,

24:57.533 --> 25:02.823
- and it's the third one along.
- Amazing.

25:02.825 --> 25:04.198
How did you know?

25:04.200 --> 25:08.741
Actually, it's right here.
Take a look.

25:19.575 --> 25:21.448
Are you OK, Jim?

25:21.450 --> 25:23.656
Jim, can you hear me?

25:23.658 --> 25:26.991
Perfect young lad who...

25:35.950 --> 25:38.698
Perfect young lad
who moved to Rome.

25:38.700 --> 25:41.114
Perfect young lad
who moved to Rome.

25:41.116 --> 25:41.989
He's delirious.

25:41.991 --> 25:44.531
Do you think he even knows
which century he's in?

25:44.533 --> 25:46.614
Probably not.
It was a heavy fall.

25:46.616 --> 25:49.156
- Where the fuck am I?
- Show some respect.

25:49.158 --> 25:51.531
We're posing for
a 17th-century masterpiece.

25:51.533 --> 25:54.989
Yeah. Destined to hang
in the Vatican, apparently.

25:54.991 --> 25:56.906
The Entombment of Christ,

25:56.908 --> 25:59.323
painted by Caravaggio in 1601.

25:59.325 --> 26:02.698
Considered by many
to be the finest example of...

26:02.700 --> 26:06.823
Oh, not now, George.
Isn't he supposed to be dead?

26:06.825 --> 26:09.281
I knew I should never
have let him out of my sight.

26:09.283 --> 26:12.864
Don't worry, Mum. I've met
some really interesting people.

26:12.866 --> 26:14.906
Won't be long now
till I'm resurrected.

26:14.908 --> 26:17.031
The resurrection
will look after itself.

26:17.033 --> 26:18.948
Just tell me how
your first job went.

26:18.950 --> 26:22.698
The sex was great.
The problems came after.

26:22.700 --> 26:25.989
I think I'm too serious.
I need to lighten up.

26:25.991 --> 26:27.906
That's right. He does.

26:27.908 --> 26:29.781
I offered to pay him
but he was having none of it.

26:29.783 --> 26:35.325
That's not a great start, is it?
You think we do this for fun?

26:37.616 --> 26:39.573
Where's Caravaggio, by the way?

26:40.700 --> 26:42.073
Well, there's nobody out there.

26:42.075 --> 26:45.031
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

26:45.033 --> 26:49.491
Maybe he's on the run.

27:03.366 --> 27:07.614
Was Caravaggio such a bad boy
or was half of it just made up?

27:07.616 --> 27:11.156
That's the beauty of it,
I suppose.

27:11.158 --> 27:13.325
We'll never really know.

27:13.908 --> 27:14.989
One part is true.

27:14.991 --> 27:18.989
We know he killed someone
in a duel.

27:18.991 --> 27:23.908
But parts of his life
are legend, I suspect.

27:25.825 --> 27:28.239
He's a fascinating character.

27:28.241 --> 27:30.156
And a great self-publicist.

27:30.158 --> 27:34.531
Just not the kind of man you
want to meet in a dark alley.

27:34.533 --> 27:39.241
That's exactly
where I'd like to meet him.

28:45.533 --> 28:48.448
You remind me
of someone I once knew.

28:51.700 --> 28:54.075
He's gone now.

28:57.950 --> 28:59.783
Do you miss him?

29:01.158 --> 29:03.241
I miss him terribly.

29:05.116 --> 29:06.948
He last wrote to me from Italy.

29:06.950 --> 29:10.698
He described a painting.
Beautiful.

29:10.700 --> 29:14.075
A painting that he saw
in a church.

29:14.491 --> 29:16.364
I never saw it.

29:16.366 --> 29:19.783
Except as a reproduction
in a book.

29:21.200 --> 29:24.033
I never saw him again either.

29:26.408 --> 29:29.239
Why so sad all of a sudden?

29:29.241 --> 29:33.158
I'm not sad.
Just thinking, is all.

29:36.116 --> 29:39.533
I wish you could see
that painting.

29:40.033 --> 29:42.989
I wish we could see it together.

29:42.991 --> 29:45.866
Don't be so serious.

29:50.241 --> 29:54.033
Enjoy your time
in the spotlight.

29:56.158 --> 29:58.700
I'll try.

30:24.158 --> 30:26.656
I don't think I can do
this job any more.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.406
I think I'm too sensitive.

30:28.408 --> 30:28.906
It's early days.

30:28.908 --> 30:31.864
And part of what we do is listen
to other people's problems.

30:31.866 --> 30:32.906
It comes with the territory.

30:32.908 --> 30:35.864
But I take their problems
home with me at night.

30:35.866 --> 30:36.656
It's affecting my studies.

30:36.658 --> 30:39.531
Lie back and think of England.
This is what I do.

30:39.533 --> 30:40.823
Shouldn't you think of Spain?

30:40.825 --> 30:42.906
Try not to get
emotionally involved.

30:42.908 --> 30:43.906
I wanna be emotionally involved.

30:43.908 --> 30:46.448
I see a lot of loneliness
out there, a lot of sadness.

30:46.450 --> 30:49.948
This is London. Everyone's
lonely to a certain extent.

30:49.950 --> 30:52.698
That's why we need
to stick together.

30:55.033 --> 30:57.406
Hello?

30:57.408 --> 30:58.614
Yeah.

30:58.616 --> 30:59.781
Saint Sebastian?

30:59.783 --> 31:03.116
Painted by Guido Reni in 1625.

31:03.533 --> 31:07.366
Yeah, no worries.
Be there as soon as I can.

31:08.325 --> 31:08.823
Just remember,

31:08.825 --> 31:13.325
you're a sex worker,
not a miracle worker.

31:14.158 --> 31:16.489
I'm a sex worker,
not a miracle worker.

31:16.491 --> 31:18.239
I'm a sex worker,
not a miracle worker.

31:18.241 --> 31:21.698
I'm a sex worker,
not a miracle worker.

31:21.700 --> 31:25.281
Ahh! Saint Sebastian,

31:25.283 --> 31:26.864
the most beautiful
of all the saints.

31:26.866 --> 31:30.489
Now, my own research suggests
that this particular saint

31:30.491 --> 31:33.198
was a middle-aged captain
of the Praetorian Guard,

31:33.200 --> 31:36.531
but erm... let's not spoil
the party.

31:36.533 --> 31:39.656
This is your last chance
to save your skin.

31:39.658 --> 31:41.906
Do you renounce
the Catholic faith?

31:41.908 --> 31:45.406
I'll do whatever you want.
It's your money.

31:45.408 --> 31:48.489
Christian martyrs aren't in it
for the money.

31:48.491 --> 31:49.198
Have some self-respect.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.531
Be careful where you point
that arrow, Tony.

31:51.533 --> 31:54.448
I'm not wearing any...
protection.

31:54.450 --> 31:55.781
I'm paying £100 for you

31:55.783 --> 31:59.198
to transport me back
to the glories of ancient Rome.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.781
You could at least
call me Diocletian.

32:04.783 --> 32:07.614
Ah, good evening, gentlemen.
How are you both doing today?

32:07.616 --> 32:10.031
- Perfectly fine, thank you.
- Glad to hear it.

32:10.033 --> 32:13.698
Right, I've got two
cheeseburgers with extra bacon,

32:13.700 --> 32:14.364
two portions of fries,

32:14.366 --> 32:16.323
a cheap bottle of red wine
and a bowl of fruit

32:16.325 --> 32:19.573
arranged in the style of a
17th-century Italian still life.

32:19.575 --> 32:21.364
Now, anything else
I can get for you?

32:21.366 --> 32:24.406
It's very kind of you,
but no, thank you.

32:25.408 --> 32:28.364
You gentlemen haven't
been smoking in here, have you?

32:28.366 --> 32:30.364
It's strictly against
company policy.

32:30.366 --> 32:32.448
Certainly not.
It's a disgusting habit.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.989
And now, sadly,
I must bid you good night.

32:34.991 --> 32:38.156
Sir, I can definitely smell
cigarette smoke in this room.

32:38.158 --> 32:41.406
Young man, we have
urgent business to attend to

32:41.408 --> 32:42.323
and you are clearly delusional!

32:42.325 --> 32:46.200
But, sir, I may have
to report you to my superiors!

32:48.075 --> 32:49.739
As I was saying,

32:49.741 --> 32:53.073
the year is 288...

32:53.075 --> 32:56.198
and the greatest empire
the world has ever known

32:56.200 --> 32:57.364
is on the brink of collapse.

32:57.366 --> 32:58.906
- To the north...
- I'm not being funny...

32:58.908 --> 33:03.073
To the north... the Germanic
tribes are restless.

33:03.075 --> 33:05.781
To the east,
the Huns are on the march.

33:05.783 --> 33:08.156
I'm not being funny,
but in the painting,

33:08.158 --> 33:11.073
Saint Sebastian
was a good-looking bloke.

33:11.075 --> 33:14.281
Oh... I give up.

33:14.283 --> 33:16.698
I thought we were here
to recreate

33:16.700 --> 33:17.781
a 17th-century masterpiece.

33:17.783 --> 33:19.906
No, we are,
and I'm having a great time.

33:19.908 --> 33:23.781
It's just... I've been thinking
of antiquity, is all.

33:23.783 --> 33:27.239
You Raconteurs do too much
thinking for my liking.

33:27.241 --> 33:31.031
Thinking's what we do,
amongst other things.

33:31.033 --> 33:32.739
Get to the point.

33:32.741 --> 33:34.448
The barbarians are at the gates.

33:34.450 --> 33:38.114
My point is you've got him...
you've got me.

33:38.116 --> 33:39.573
I mean, held captive in a room.

33:39.575 --> 33:42.489
Why re-enact his death
when you can just fuck him,

33:42.491 --> 33:46.156
and we can both enjoy
some post-coital conversation?

33:46.158 --> 33:49.781
First of all, I don't appreciate
the crude language.

33:49.783 --> 33:50.989
And, second, what I do

33:50.991 --> 33:54.614
in the privacy of a cheap hotel
room with a Catholic saint

33:54.616 --> 33:56.698
is my concern and not yours.

33:56.700 --> 33:59.448
Sorry.
I've done it again.

33:59.450 --> 34:00.906
I've spoilt the vibe.
You carry on.

34:00.908 --> 34:04.864
My dear boy, do you even know
the story of Saint Sebastian?

34:04.866 --> 34:07.323
I know he died a slow
and painful death

34:07.325 --> 34:08.364
at the hand of the Romans.

34:08.366 --> 34:10.072
And he was the world's first
male pin-up.

34:10.074 --> 34:13.489
Sebastian died
for the glory

34:13.491 --> 34:14.281
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

34:14.283 --> 34:18.072
Even a cursory glance at
Wikipedia could tell you that.

34:18.074 --> 34:22.989
The fact that he had a fit body
is completely beside the point.

34:22.991 --> 34:25.156
Having a fit body
is never beside the point.

34:25.158 --> 34:28.906
You know how much
a gym membership costs nowadays?

34:28.908 --> 34:33.199
Frankly, I neither know
nor care.

34:33.574 --> 34:36.449
Give us a drag, will you?

34:42.574 --> 34:46.197
Despite your
undoubted beauty,

34:46.199 --> 34:47.906
I have a sneaking suspicion

34:47.908 --> 34:51.449
I'm going to come away
from this encounter...

34:51.866 --> 34:53.531
somewhat deflated.

35:18.783 --> 35:21.739
People go crazy
for Sebastian, don't they?

35:21.741 --> 35:24.698
I mean, if he was alive today,
he would make a killing.

35:24.700 --> 35:29.739
If Sebastian was alive today,
we'd all be out of a job.

35:29.741 --> 35:31.781
He wanted me to talk dirty
to him in Latin,

35:31.783 --> 35:33.781
but I didn't have time
to practise.

35:33.783 --> 35:34.989
Was he a priest, do you think?

35:34.991 --> 35:38.989
In my experience, priests tend
to avoid classical iconography.

35:38.991 --> 35:41.364
They prefer things
more down and dirty.

35:41.366 --> 35:44.239
Tony just has a fetish
for boys of antiquity.

35:44.241 --> 35:44.781
On our next date,

35:44.783 --> 35:47.031
we're gonna recreate
the bath scene fromSpartacus.

35:47.033 --> 35:50.573
You need to charge extra
for that shit.

35:50.575 --> 35:52.658
Did you get the money?

35:52.991 --> 35:56.031
I took it. Then I gave it back.

35:56.033 --> 35:58.448
You took it,
then you gave it back?

35:58.450 --> 36:00.198
I felt bad for him.
His life's a mess.

36:00.200 --> 36:03.739
Your life's gonna be a mess
if you keep working for free.

36:03.741 --> 36:05.906
I am skint, to be honest.

36:05.908 --> 36:07.114
Listen, I think it's about time

36:07.116 --> 36:10.614
we introduced you
to a proper artist.

36:10.616 --> 36:12.198
One who's not dead.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.156
I'm well up for that.

36:13.158 --> 36:15.156
I've got a friend
who wants to meet you.

36:15.158 --> 36:16.948
He's been pestering me
for weeks.

36:16.950 --> 36:22.950
He's... He's super talented, but
he's hit a bit of a dry patch.

36:23.450 --> 36:25.950
I'm ready, let's go.

36:26.158 --> 36:27.739
It's two o'clock
in the morning.

36:27.741 --> 36:30.281
Come on.
Where's your sense of adventure?

36:30.283 --> 36:32.281
- Huh?
- All right, fuck it.

36:32.283 --> 36:34.616
Let's do it.

36:42.533 --> 36:47.698
Max, meet Jim. Jim's obsessed
with becoming a muse.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.948
I'm modelling myself
on George Dyer.

36:49.950 --> 36:51.781
Without the tragic ending,
I hope.

36:51.783 --> 36:55.489
Jim, where have you been
all my life?

36:55.491 --> 36:58.239
What I love about George
is that he inspired

36:58.241 --> 36:59.989
some of the greatest art
of the 20th century,

36:59.991 --> 37:02.114
but he could still
mash it up at the pub

37:02.116 --> 37:05.033
with his mates
on a Saturday night.

37:05.616 --> 37:08.073
Shame he was a manic depressive.

37:08.075 --> 37:10.864
Living with Francis Bacon
was no bed of roses,

37:10.866 --> 37:12.448
I can tell you that.

37:12.450 --> 37:14.406
I've read about you in a book.

37:14.408 --> 37:16.114
British Portraiture
and Introspectives.

37:16.116 --> 37:20.031
I'm told that every phone box
within a mile of Soho

37:20.033 --> 37:23.906
has become a shrine
to your beauty.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.366
Something like that, yeah.

37:42.908 --> 37:45.698
Go easy. He's not as tough
as we originally thought.

37:45.700 --> 37:48.906
What took you so long?
I've been begging you for weeks.

37:48.908 --> 37:51.073
I told you. He wasn't ready.

37:51.075 --> 37:53.198
This kid could be
the greatest thing

37:53.200 --> 37:54.156
that's happened to me in years.

37:54.158 --> 37:56.406
I've got a major retrospective
coming up.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.281
- I need new material.
- I know.

37:58.283 --> 38:00.114
I know. I'm just saying
he's sensitive.

38:00.116 --> 38:02.573
- That's all.
- You and me go back a long way.

38:02.575 --> 38:04.448
- I painted you once, remember?
- I remember.

38:04.450 --> 38:07.156
I'm hanging
in a gallery somewhere. It's...

38:07.158 --> 38:08.073
I've been stale for years

38:08.075 --> 38:10.656
and you were too polite
to tell me the truth.

38:10.658 --> 38:12.073
It's been hard. I get it.

38:12.075 --> 38:14.489
And muses are thin
on the ground these days.

38:14.491 --> 38:18.906
Just... break him in gently.
Please.

38:18.908 --> 38:20.114
If he wants to be a muse

38:20.116 --> 38:23.323
he'll have to put the work in,
simple as that.

38:23.325 --> 38:25.823
Because when it comes
to the male form,

38:25.825 --> 38:28.783
I am an incurable romantic.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.739
If being a muse was easy,
every Tom...

38:31.741 --> 38:35.281
- Tom, Dick and Harry, yes.
- Don't take the piss.

38:35.283 --> 38:36.489
Just give me six months
with him.

38:36.491 --> 38:39.156
Six months?
How much are you paying him?

38:39.158 --> 38:42.239
How much does he get
for the other stuff?

38:43.158 --> 38:46.406
How much? Jesus Christ,
I'm in the wrong game.

38:46.408 --> 38:49.448
I used to be quite a looker
in my time, you know.

38:49.450 --> 38:52.033
Well, everyone said it.

38:54.616 --> 38:56.614
Do you believe in fate, Jim?

38:56.616 --> 38:57.531
I do, actually, yeah.

38:57.533 --> 39:00.406
Then it's fate
that has brought us together.

39:00.408 --> 39:05.448
I'll expect you every day
at 8pm sharp, except Sunday.

39:05.450 --> 39:06.948
We'll work through the night.

39:06.950 --> 39:09.114
I won't tolerate
any bad timekeeping.

39:09.116 --> 39:10.281
Yes, sir.

39:10.283 --> 39:12.698
Beauty will only get you so far
in this business.

39:12.700 --> 39:16.406
You have to dedicate yourself.
You have to concentrate.

39:16.408 --> 39:17.864
I wanna do this, Max,
I really do.

39:17.866 --> 39:21.448
I'm going to request
that you do not move,

39:21.450 --> 39:22.531
that you do not speak.

39:22.533 --> 39:25.614
After we finish
you can talk all you like.

39:25.616 --> 39:27.864
I'm tired of talking,
to tell you the truth.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.281
Talking just gets me
into trouble.

39:30.283 --> 39:30.948
Good.

39:30.950 --> 39:33.575
Let's get down to work, then.

40:16.991 --> 40:18.781
I particularly like
the tension

40:18.783 --> 40:25.073
between the beauty of the image
and the violence of the pose.

40:25.075 --> 40:28.156
The taut muscles,
the clenched fists.

40:28.158 --> 40:31.531
The thickness of the paint,
the bold strokes.

40:31.533 --> 40:35.281
I can't believe I've finally
made it onto a canvas.

40:35.283 --> 40:37.114
And this is just the beginning.

40:37.116 --> 40:39.864
I imagine a whole series
of paintings,

40:39.866 --> 40:41.281
exploring every facet of...

40:41.283 --> 40:43.950
All you all right?

40:44.450 --> 40:44.948
Yeah.

40:44.950 --> 40:47.781
Yeah, no, I just... I've been
sat in here for months.

40:47.783 --> 40:49.864
I need to get some fresh air,
that's all.

40:49.866 --> 40:53.991
I wish
I had your problems.

41:27.950 --> 41:30.156
What happened to you?
You look like shit, mate.

41:30.158 --> 41:34.364
It's nice to see you, too. I've
been working a lot, that's all.

41:34.366 --> 41:35.573
What, you call that work?

41:35.575 --> 41:38.948
Sitting on your arse all day
and getting paid for it?

41:38.950 --> 41:40.906
You did all right for yourself
in the end.

41:40.908 --> 41:43.614
And you can say it was me
who discovered you.

41:43.616 --> 41:44.989
What are you talking about?

41:44.991 --> 41:48.448
I was the one who brought you to
that bar that night, remember?

41:48.450 --> 41:51.948
It was me who took you
under my wing, so to speak,

41:51.950 --> 41:54.323
on the path to fame and fortune.

41:54.325 --> 41:54.864
Hang on a minute.

41:54.866 --> 41:57.739
Weren't you the one who tried
to charge me ten quid a night

41:57.741 --> 41:59.906
- to sleep in a cardboard box?
- Listen.

41:59.908 --> 42:02.948
Why are all rent boys
so cynical these days?

42:02.950 --> 42:05.239
I'm not a rent boy, I'm a muse.

42:05.241 --> 42:05.698
Exactly!

42:05.700 --> 42:06.656
And muse ain't the type of job

42:06.658 --> 42:08.906
you see advertised
in the job centre, is it?

42:08.908 --> 42:12.741
Being in the right place
at the right time.

42:13.616 --> 42:14.114
You know what?

42:14.116 --> 42:17.073
I think I'm beginning to see
what all the fuss is about.

42:17.075 --> 42:19.239
Stop touching my face.

42:19.241 --> 42:20.364
Oh, you reckon cos I'm homeless,

42:20.366 --> 42:24.616
I can't appreciate
good bone structure?

42:25.866 --> 42:31.698
Listen, mate, are you all right?
You're acting well weird.

42:38.075 --> 42:39.073
Fuck me.

42:39.075 --> 42:41.700
Youaretired.

43:39.658 --> 43:40.531
What's going on?

43:40.533 --> 43:43.114
I was about to ask you
the same question.

43:43.116 --> 43:43.781
We're worried about you.

43:43.783 --> 43:46.031
I'm worried too. I don't know
what's wrong with me.

43:46.033 --> 43:47.448
Being sensitive
is all well and good,

43:47.450 --> 43:49.364
but you can't be fainting
every five minutes.

43:49.366 --> 43:51.906
- It makes people nervous.
- The sex I can deal with.

43:51.908 --> 43:55.114
- It's the art that fucks me up.
- Tell us what's been happening.

43:55.116 --> 43:58.614
Go from the beginning,
before you met us, I mean.

44:00.283 --> 44:01.656
OK.

44:01.658 --> 44:03.864
Er...

44:03.866 --> 44:04.823
It was my last year at school

44:04.825 --> 44:07.114
and all I could think about
was moving to London.

44:07.116 --> 44:09.948
But I had a thing for my
art teacher. And I'd do anything

44:09.950 --> 44:11.864
- to catch a glimpse of him.
- You had it bad.

44:11.866 --> 44:14.281
Really bad. I've got a thing
for educated people

44:14.283 --> 44:18.364
and this bloke had practically
swallowed a dictionary.

44:18.366 --> 44:21.948
Late one night, he lured me into
the corner of the library,

44:21.950 --> 44:24.614
and showed me
some disturbing images.

44:24.616 --> 44:26.031
- What? Porn?
- No.

44:26.033 --> 44:29.448
It was art, but like nothing
I'd ever seen before.

44:29.450 --> 44:30.198
Now I know it was Baroque,

44:30.200 --> 44:33.364
but back then, I didn't know
what the fuck was going on.

44:33.366 --> 44:34.031
Don't get me wrong,

44:34.033 --> 44:36.406
the naked bodies were a turn-on,
it's just...

44:36.408 --> 44:37.406
Did he ever touch you?

44:37.408 --> 44:40.781
No. He just stared at me
for hours.

44:40.783 --> 44:42.239
He objectified you.

44:42.241 --> 44:44.531
I was proper objectified, yeah.

44:44.533 --> 44:46.406
But that was when
it got more serious

44:46.408 --> 44:47.948
and we started going
to galleries,

44:47.950 --> 44:50.281
and whilst I stared
at the paintings,

44:50.283 --> 44:50.948
he'd be staring at me.

44:50.950 --> 44:54.364
Did you tell the police?
Social services?

44:54.366 --> 44:57.948
No, I secretly enjoyed
the attention.

44:57.950 --> 45:00.239
But that's when
I started to get sick.

45:00.241 --> 45:01.656
I saw myself in the paintings.

45:01.658 --> 45:04.114
So, let me get this straight.

45:04.116 --> 45:05.489
We have a sensitive teenage boy

45:05.491 --> 45:07.739
coming to terms
with his sexuality

45:07.741 --> 45:09.698
and a highly intelligent
older male

45:09.700 --> 45:12.364
who uses art
as a means of seduction.

45:12.366 --> 45:13.948
Correct.

45:13.950 --> 45:15.073
To complicate matters further,

45:15.075 --> 45:18.156
and for reasons we don't
yet understand, said teenage boy

45:18.158 --> 45:20.573
can't look
at a beautiful painting

45:20.575 --> 45:22.614
without feeling
emotionally overwhelmed,

45:22.616 --> 45:24.739
without imagining himself in it.

45:24.741 --> 45:26.364
Also correct.

45:26.366 --> 45:28.031
We need to get you to a doctor.

45:28.033 --> 45:30.489
Maybe I should just
avoid art galleries.

45:30.491 --> 45:33.323
That's impossible in
our line of work, you know that.

45:33.325 --> 45:35.656
I'm thinking
of changing my career.

45:35.658 --> 45:37.281
Don't be too hasty.

45:37.283 --> 45:39.698
I know the person
you should see.

45:39.700 --> 45:41.531
- You do?
- I do.

45:41.533 --> 45:45.406
She's not cheap
but she's good at what she does.

45:45.408 --> 45:46.531
What does she do?

45:46.533 --> 45:50.866
She specialises in illnesses
no one's ever heard of.

45:53.241 --> 45:55.573
Give her a call.

45:55.575 --> 45:58.573
Come on, handsome. Don't be shy.

46:00.450 --> 46:06.781
Jim, why do you think Caravaggio
has been such a problem for you?

46:06.783 --> 46:08.614
Oh, don't get me wrong,
I'm a big fan.

46:08.616 --> 46:10.448
For me,
it's where modern art started.

46:10.450 --> 46:13.489
And you feel a compulsion
to return to him,

46:13.491 --> 46:15.573
to study his work again
and again?

46:15.575 --> 46:17.198
Look, Caravaggio probably wasn't

46:17.200 --> 46:18.698
the greatest artist
who ever lived.

46:18.700 --> 46:22.864
Technically, I mean, but the way
he painted darkness and light,

46:22.866 --> 46:25.156
he was brilliant,
no one could touch him.

46:25.158 --> 46:26.906
And what about
the people he painted?

46:26.908 --> 46:30.114
The tricksters, the whores,
the undesirables?

46:30.116 --> 46:33.323
I love the fact he took
ordinary people from the street

46:33.325 --> 46:36.864
and made 'em look like saints.
He was the first one to do that.

46:36.866 --> 46:39.864
Do you identify with the people
in his paintings?

46:39.866 --> 46:42.781
I do, yeah.
I feel like I know them.

46:42.783 --> 46:45.741
They could be me or my mates.

46:45.991 --> 46:48.656
Would you consider yourself
a religious person?

46:48.658 --> 46:52.823
Not really.
I just imagine the worst.

46:52.825 --> 46:56.656
When I see Baby Jesus, I just
think about the crucifixion.

46:56.658 --> 46:59.614
All that pain and suffering
really gets to me.

46:59.616 --> 47:05.783
And the beauty of it just
draws me in and... won't let go.

47:05.991 --> 47:08.906
Jim, there are a number
of syndromes

47:08.908 --> 47:12.864
associated with these kinds
of reactions to art,

47:12.866 --> 47:15.614
from mild anxiety
to severe delusional states.

47:15.616 --> 47:19.364
Do you think I'm on
the high end of the spectrum?

47:19.366 --> 47:22.950
Well, that's what
we're about to discover.

47:23.866 --> 47:26.906
Try and stay calm.

47:26.908 --> 47:29.489
I'm going to remove
your blindfold.

47:29.491 --> 47:33.698
And when I do, we'll approach
the painting together.

47:33.700 --> 47:36.906
And I want you
to describe what you see.

47:36.908 --> 47:39.033
OK?

47:56.533 --> 47:59.075
The Musicians.

48:00.908 --> 48:02.698
It's beautiful, isn't it?

48:02.700 --> 48:06.948
Hmm. It's a beautiful painting,
yes, but what else?

48:06.950 --> 48:09.741
What else do you see?

48:10.908 --> 48:13.031
I see myself.

48:13.033 --> 48:15.575
There, look.

48:18.325 --> 48:21.116
Music. I can hear music.

48:21.575 --> 48:24.616
Like tuning of instruments.

48:38.783 --> 48:40.073
What are you lot doing here?

48:40.075 --> 48:44.531
Italian bloke. The one
with the mad glint in his eye.

48:44.533 --> 48:45.406
Caravaggio.

48:45.408 --> 48:46.698
Yeah, whatever his name is.

48:46.700 --> 48:49.948
He was wandering round Soho
looking confused.

48:49.950 --> 48:51.656
At first I thought
he was homeless,

48:51.658 --> 48:53.114
but it turns out
he's proper famous.

48:53.116 --> 48:56.156
He's famous, all right,
but he can be very tricky.

48:56.158 --> 48:58.781
Yeah. He definitely had
a few too many.

48:58.783 --> 49:00.948
You could smell it
on his breath.

49:00.950 --> 49:04.781
Anyway, he offered me a few gold
coins and a warm bed at night,

49:04.783 --> 49:08.198
if I... dressed up as Cupid.

49:08.200 --> 49:08.823
What's up with you?

49:08.825 --> 49:11.948
I'm having a check-up on the
state of my mental well-being

49:11.950 --> 49:14.364
from a doctor
who was once a prostitute.

49:14.366 --> 49:17.448
Fair enough.
Is she fit?

49:17.450 --> 49:21.783
You need to be quiet.
He looks pissed off.

49:22.950 --> 49:25.491
Oh, fuck, here he comes.

49:34.033 --> 49:34.698
Call me old-fashioned,

49:34.700 --> 49:36.739
but pretty boys are supposed
to pose for the artist

49:36.741 --> 49:39.073
- and keep their mouths shut.
- We were just saying...

49:39.075 --> 49:41.781
Have you ever tried working
with this much noise going on?

49:41.783 --> 49:45.614
- You should try it some time.
- You need to take a chill pill.

49:45.616 --> 49:47.364
It's just a bit of banter.

49:47.366 --> 49:50.989
Remember, this is one
of your lightest pieces.

49:50.991 --> 49:53.448
You boys make me want to puke.

49:53.450 --> 49:54.906
Thinking you're better
than anyone else

49:54.908 --> 49:58.114
just cos you're hanging
in a gallery somewhere.

49:58.116 --> 49:59.406
Who gives a shit?

49:59.408 --> 50:01.739
You were the one who chose us,
remember?

50:01.741 --> 50:03.864
You plucked us from obscurity.

50:03.866 --> 50:06.281
It's tough working in this town,
you know.

50:06.283 --> 50:08.156
Roman cardinals
can be very picky.

50:08.158 --> 50:11.616
And don't even get me started
on the Pope.

50:12.908 --> 50:17.864
No one ever asks Caravaggio
if he's having a nice day.

50:17.866 --> 50:18.781
What's this guy's problem?

50:18.783 --> 50:21.781
I think the problem
is he's a tortured genius.

50:21.783 --> 50:24.156
I'll tell you
what the problem is.

50:24.158 --> 50:28.656
I have boys queueing round the
block to sit where you are now.

50:28.658 --> 50:31.489
So, any more bullshit
from you...

50:31.491 --> 50:34.323
and I'll throw you back to the
gutter where you belong.

50:34.325 --> 50:36.823
- Understood?
- Understood.

50:36.825 --> 50:39.989
I make you and your boyfriends
pretty in my paintings,

50:39.991 --> 50:43.200
so don't fuck with me!

50:44.241 --> 50:46.408
OK?

50:53.158 --> 50:55.739
Caravaggio,
temperamental genius.

50:55.741 --> 50:56.739
Fugitive from the law.

50:56.741 --> 51:01.325
- Apparently a homo.
- Definitely a nutter.

51:05.200 --> 51:10.408
Jim, where did you think
you were?

51:12.200 --> 51:13.989
I imagined I was in Rome

51:13.991 --> 51:16.364
in the summer of 1595.

51:16.366 --> 51:19.323
In the home
of Cardinal del Monte,

51:19.325 --> 51:21.281
being painted by Caravaggio.

51:21.283 --> 51:22.656
I was one of the musicians.

51:22.658 --> 51:24.239
We were just tuning
our instruments,

51:24.241 --> 51:26.781
minding our own business
when it all kicked off.

51:26.783 --> 51:30.073
In what sense did it...
kick off?

51:30.075 --> 51:34.198
Look, I know Caravaggio's
got a lot on his plate:

51:34.200 --> 51:37.573
murder, illness,
exiled to Sicily.

51:37.575 --> 51:39.739
It's just...
He needs to chill out a bit.

51:39.741 --> 51:42.781
He's not been having
a great time of it lately.

51:42.783 --> 51:43.364
I understand that.

51:43.366 --> 51:45.156
He hasn't got much longer
to live and all that.

51:45.158 --> 51:48.448
But he doesn't need
to be so touchy, you know?

51:48.450 --> 51:52.239
Jim, I'm afraid
I've got some bad news.

51:52.241 --> 51:53.448
Well, I knew that was coming.

51:53.450 --> 51:55.573
You are suffering
from a rare condition

51:55.575 --> 51:56.989
called Stendhal syndrome.

51:56.991 --> 52:00.114
Not a debilitating illness,
by any means.

52:00.116 --> 52:03.364
But you'll definitely
need to make some changes

52:03.366 --> 52:03.989
in your lifestyle.

52:03.991 --> 52:06.989
Can you explain to me
what that means?

52:06.991 --> 52:09.989
I... can.

52:09.991 --> 52:11.198
But not right now.

52:11.200 --> 52:16.448
Unfortunately, I'm late
for my next appointment.

52:16.450 --> 52:17.198
What, that's it?

52:17.200 --> 52:18.906
I'm afraid so. Time is money.

52:18.908 --> 52:22.364
But if you have any questions,
please do give me a call.

52:22.366 --> 52:24.531
Well, I have lots of questions.

52:24.533 --> 52:25.031
Goodbye, Jim.

52:25.033 --> 52:27.948
Please get some rest.
And, remember,

52:27.950 --> 52:28.864
paintings of the Baroque period

52:28.866 --> 52:32.616
should be avoided
as much as possible.

52:33.866 --> 52:36.198
Oh, and one last thing.

52:36.200 --> 52:38.989
- What?
- Caravaggio can be prickly.

52:38.991 --> 52:40.989
But he's really
not such a bad person.

52:40.991 --> 52:43.531
You're talking about a bloke
who killed someone

52:43.533 --> 52:45.281
over an argument
in a tennis match.

52:59.450 --> 53:01.698
The doctor told me
to avoid Caravaggio

53:01.700 --> 53:04.406
if I want to keep my sanity.

53:04.408 --> 53:05.656
What kind of life is that?

53:05.658 --> 53:07.739
I feel sorry for you,
I really do.

53:07.741 --> 53:09.906
I know where you're coming from.

53:09.908 --> 53:12.198
But give me
the tremendous violence

53:12.200 --> 53:14.698
of Francis Bacon any days
of the week.

53:14.700 --> 53:18.448
The screaming queen
paints a screaming pope.

53:18.450 --> 53:21.281
The human mouth
as a gaping wound.

53:21.283 --> 53:22.489
If you force me to choose,

53:22.491 --> 53:24.823
I mean, if you put a gun
to my head,

53:24.825 --> 53:25.698
I'd go for Mapplethorpe.

53:25.700 --> 53:30.031
No, his work is too cold.
There is no emotion.

53:30.033 --> 53:31.948
That man knew
how to photograph beauty.

53:31.950 --> 53:34.864
Mapplethorpe didn't understand
the men he photographed.

53:34.866 --> 53:39.323
They were reduced to what hung
between their legs.

53:39.325 --> 53:39.698
Bollocks!

53:39.700 --> 53:44.991
At the end of the day...
we're all just pieces of meat.

53:52.575 --> 53:55.239
Guys...
Guys, can someone tell me

53:55.241 --> 53:56.739
what the fuck is going on?

53:56.741 --> 53:57.406
According to our friend,

53:57.408 --> 54:00.031
you have a syndrome
named after Henry Stendhal.

54:00.033 --> 54:02.781
Stendhal syndrome
is a rare illness

54:02.783 --> 54:04.698
which affects some individuals

54:04.700 --> 54:06.906
that are exposed to fine art.

54:06.908 --> 54:08.989
It can cause dizziness,

54:08.991 --> 54:11.989
hallucinations
and even blackouts.

54:11.991 --> 54:13.614
Was this Stendhal bloke
a doctor?

54:13.616 --> 54:15.614
No. No, he was
a 19th-century novelist

54:15.616 --> 54:16.823
who wrote
The Charterhouse of Parma,

54:16.825 --> 54:20.239
amongst other things. He was
a little flowery for my taste.

54:20.241 --> 54:21.364
But you know
how the French are.

54:21.366 --> 54:25.156
Hey! Your clichéd view of my
country is 50 years out of date.

54:25.158 --> 54:29.114
We have a vibrant youth culture,
the rap scene is massive,

54:29.116 --> 54:31.864
and we have tension
in the suburbs.

54:31.866 --> 54:32.489
So go fuck yourself.

54:32.491 --> 54:35.781
"Stendhal wrote about his
experience with the phenomenon

54:35.783 --> 54:40.783
after a visit to Florence
in the summer of 1817."

54:42.241 --> 54:45.906
"Absorbed in the contemplation
of divine beauty,

54:45.908 --> 54:50.239
I could perceive
its very essence close at hand."

54:50.241 --> 54:51.823
"I could, as it were,

54:51.825 --> 54:56.450
feel the stuff of it
beneath my fingertips."

54:56.908 --> 55:01.033
Wait a minute, I've never
even been to Florence.

55:04.283 --> 55:06.575
Oh, fuck!

55:39.658 --> 55:41.114
What's going on, mate?

55:41.116 --> 55:43.698
You're late.

55:43.700 --> 55:46.823
I won't tolerate
bad timekeeping.

55:46.825 --> 55:49.114
I'm sorry. What's going on?

55:49.116 --> 55:52.073
What's going on is...
you were late.

55:52.075 --> 55:55.198
And I sat here and I... began
to look at these paintings.

55:55.200 --> 55:59.073
You could hardly
call them paintings.

55:59.075 --> 56:01.406
More an attempt at painting.

56:01.408 --> 56:04.614
And I began to think
about my work.

56:04.616 --> 56:08.739
My life's work is in this room,
gathering dust.

56:08.741 --> 56:11.031
And a lot of it's fine work,
Max.

56:11.033 --> 56:13.198
I told you, no talking.

56:13.200 --> 56:17.866
No talking, no moving,
unless I tell you.

56:18.325 --> 56:20.406
You have to... concentrate.

56:20.408 --> 56:24.739
You have to concentrate and you
have to dedicate yourself.

56:24.741 --> 56:27.948
We haven't started work yet,
Max.

56:27.950 --> 56:30.323
You were late.

56:30.325 --> 56:33.823
And my life's work's
in this room.

56:33.825 --> 56:36.866
And it's a pile of crap.

56:39.241 --> 56:42.239
I'm old and I'm tired.
I...

56:42.241 --> 56:46.283
I hadn't painted anything
half decent in years.

56:47.825 --> 56:50.448
- Until you come along.
- That's not true.

56:50.450 --> 56:53.241
Oh, we both know it's true.

56:54.950 --> 56:57.783
But I'm not giving up.

56:58.158 --> 57:00.825
I'm gonna start again.

57:01.158 --> 57:03.989
You're the first piece
of true inspiration

57:03.991 --> 57:05.448
I've had in 30 years.

57:05.450 --> 57:09.156
And inspiration's
a precious gift, Jim.

57:09.158 --> 57:10.948
So I thank you for that.

57:10.950 --> 57:13.908
You're a beautiful young man.

57:14.741 --> 57:18.658
Have the day off.
You deserve it.

58:04.075 --> 58:08.573
You've come a long way.
I'm impressed.

58:08.575 --> 58:11.739
Thanks. It means a lot.

58:11.741 --> 58:15.198
It's a beautiful painting, Max.

58:15.200 --> 58:16.198
Really intense.

58:16.200 --> 58:18.448
Beauty should always be intense.

58:18.450 --> 58:20.864
Beauty should always
be dangerous.

58:20.866 --> 58:25.656
I notice that there was no
reference to your... sickness.

58:25.658 --> 58:29.823
Yeah. But we've got
another project in the pipeline,

58:29.825 --> 58:30.323
haven't we, Max?

58:30.325 --> 58:32.614
Imagine
a series of paintings

58:32.616 --> 58:34.614
with Jim
as a beautiful peasant boy

58:34.616 --> 58:39.198
travelling through Italy
in the steps of Stendhal.

58:39.200 --> 58:40.364
He's confused.

58:40.366 --> 58:43.114
His family have worked the land
for centuries,

58:43.116 --> 58:45.614
but he's a city boy at heart.

58:45.616 --> 58:47.031
He craves the bright lights.

58:47.033 --> 58:50.323
Did you really destroy
everything?

58:50.325 --> 58:51.698
Yeah, most of it's gone.

58:51.700 --> 58:55.616
Not worth the canvas
it was painted on.

59:29.575 --> 59:33.448
While you're busy contemplating
the size of my dick,

59:33.450 --> 59:34.698
consider this question.

59:34.700 --> 59:37.573
Why does life have to be so sad?

59:37.575 --> 59:38.281
I... I am sorry.

59:38.283 --> 59:40.823
I, erm... I lost myself there
for a moment.

59:40.825 --> 59:43.614
Don't worry.
Get it all the time.

59:43.616 --> 59:45.906
I'd hate to think of anyone

59:45.908 --> 59:48.908
as beautiful as you
ever be unhappy.

59:49.325 --> 59:51.364
Breaks my heart.

59:51.366 --> 59:55.364
Don't get me wrong. My mates
are a great bunch of lads.

59:55.366 --> 59:58.989
They've taught me to appreciate
the finer things in life.

59:58.991 --> 01:00:01.658
The music of Bach?

01:00:01.991 --> 01:00:04.239
The, er... poetry of Cavafy?

01:00:04.241 --> 01:00:06.906
Did you know,
Cavafy was once described as

01:00:06.908 --> 01:00:09.989
"a Greek gentleman
standing absolutely motionless

01:00:09.991 --> 01:00:13.156
at a slight angle
to the universe"?

01:00:13.158 --> 01:00:14.781
He was indeed.

01:00:14.783 --> 01:00:18.114
By, er... EM Forster.

01:00:18.116 --> 01:00:19.323
You're an intelligent young man.

01:00:19.325 --> 01:00:23.031
Whatever possessed you
to become a rent boy?

01:00:23.033 --> 01:00:25.364
We don't use those words.

01:00:25.366 --> 01:00:27.364
Which words should I use?

01:00:27.366 --> 01:00:31.448
Doesn't matter.
I'm a muse these days.

01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:33.198
I used to model myself
on George Dyer

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.281
but now I'm thinking
more Joe Dallesandro.

01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:38.698
Ah. Now, George and Francis
I remember well.

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:41.573
Er... Joe Dallesandro
I can only dream of.

01:00:41.575 --> 01:00:44.406
What I loved about Joe is that

01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:45.448
he was in all those films,

01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:48.906
yet, really, he was just playing
a version of himself.

01:00:48.908 --> 01:00:52.864
Well, aren't we all
doing just that?

01:00:52.866 --> 01:00:54.364
Playing versions of ourselves?

01:00:54.366 --> 01:00:56.739
I'll get back to you
on that one.

01:00:56.741 --> 01:00:58.864
How's your dancing skills?

01:00:58.866 --> 01:01:01.364
Oh, a bit rusty, but I...

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:03.198
I was considered
quite a mover in my day.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.906
Good. Then we'll have
a drink and a dance

01:01:05.908 --> 01:01:07.489
and you can tell me a story.

01:01:07.491 --> 01:01:11.031
What sort of story
should I tell you?

01:01:11.033 --> 01:01:14.114
A story about Soho
in the old days.

01:01:14.116 --> 01:01:16.781
About George and Francis,
Lucian Freud,

01:01:16.783 --> 01:01:19.364
and all the fucked-up nights
in The Colony Room.

01:01:19.366 --> 01:01:23.783
It will be
my pleasure.

01:01:25.741 --> 01:01:29.783
You tell me your story
and I'll tell you my story.

01:01:30.658 --> 01:01:32.614
OK.

01:01:32.616 --> 01:01:36.531
Basically,
I fell in with the wrong crowd,

01:01:36.533 --> 01:01:40.531
who turned out to be the right
crowd, and became a muse.

01:01:40.533 --> 01:01:43.489
And then I was diagnosed
with a rare sickness.

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:47.948
Well, I must say, you look
perfectly healthy to me.

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:51.073
Don't worry,
it's not a sexual disease.

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:53.948
It's more of a sickness
of the mind.

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:55.906
Now I am worried.

01:01:55.908 --> 01:01:58.531
I'm overly sensitive to art,

01:01:58.533 --> 01:01:59.864
which is a piss-take, really,

01:01:59.866 --> 01:02:01.073
cos I was raised
in a cultural desert.

01:02:01.075 --> 01:02:06.489
Are you receiving treatment?
Is anybody helping you with it?

01:02:06.491 --> 01:02:09.073
I've seen doctors...

01:02:09.075 --> 01:02:11.825
psychiatrists.

01:02:12.241 --> 01:02:14.323
I've tried everything.

01:02:14.325 --> 01:02:18.864
Pills, hypnosis,
injections up the arse.

01:02:18.866 --> 01:02:22.364
Well... I must say,
it sounds fascinating.

01:02:22.366 --> 01:02:23.281
You wouldn't be interested

01:02:23.283 --> 01:02:25.823
in joining me for a nightcap,
would you?

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:28.906
There's nothing fascinating
about me, mate.

01:02:28.908 --> 01:02:31.616
I'm just a sensitive lad...

01:02:32.491 --> 01:02:35.366
...with a big cock.

01:02:37.491 --> 01:02:40.114
It was lovely to meet you.

01:02:40.116 --> 01:02:44.616
But... I haven't told you
mystory.

01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:51.781
Mind if I join you?

01:02:51.783 --> 01:02:54.156
Be my guest.

01:02:54.158 --> 01:02:56.948
- I'm Paul.
- I know who you are.

01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:58.739
What you doing here?

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:01.823
Just... catching up
with my mates.

01:03:01.825 --> 01:03:02.906
Talking about old times.

01:03:02.908 --> 01:03:06.241
You're not here to see them?

01:03:08.283 --> 01:03:10.531
Came here to see you.

01:03:10.533 --> 01:03:13.698
I don't know what happened
between you and them,

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.739
but they've been good to me.

01:03:14.741 --> 01:03:18.448
Given me a job, place to stay.
Worked out well.

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:21.156
That's nice of them.
I mean, just think,

01:03:21.158 --> 01:03:24.156
you could have ended up
becoming a rent boy.

01:03:24.158 --> 01:03:25.489
It's not a word we like to use.

01:03:25.491 --> 01:03:27.906
So they dumped
a pile of books in your lap

01:03:27.908 --> 01:03:29.489
and said you were getting
an education,

01:03:29.491 --> 01:03:33.531
but really all you're doing
is selling your arse for cash

01:03:33.533 --> 01:03:35.448
and dressing it up as art.

01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:37.323
If you hated it so much,
why did you do it?

01:03:37.325 --> 01:03:43.908
I was young. Had fuck all money.
I didn't know anybody in London.

01:03:44.575 --> 01:03:47.075
Sound familiar?

01:03:47.658 --> 01:03:50.406
Heard you were
the best in your day.

01:03:50.408 --> 01:03:52.573
You took Soho by storm.

01:03:52.575 --> 01:03:54.698
Nobody cares about Soho
any more.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:57.533
It's the same
as everywhere else.

01:03:57.825 --> 01:04:00.698
Those guys,
they'll never change.

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.950
They'll always be
on the outside.

01:04:06.158 --> 01:04:07.364
And you?

01:04:07.366 --> 01:04:10.573
- I wanna be on the inside.
- You wanna make serious money.

01:04:10.575 --> 01:04:13.031
I love money.
And I'm not ashamed to say it.

01:04:13.033 --> 01:04:16.156
I knew nothing about art
until I met them.

01:04:16.158 --> 01:04:18.406
Knew nothing about anything,
really.

01:04:18.408 --> 01:04:20.489
You knew more than you think.

01:04:20.491 --> 01:04:24.073
And your friends?
They live in the past.

01:04:24.075 --> 01:04:25.156
They wanna live in the past.

01:04:25.158 --> 01:04:26.239
That's the best place
to be for them.

01:04:26.241 --> 01:04:29.906
The best thing about art is
the price you can sell it for.

01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:32.200
It's as simple as that.

01:04:33.158 --> 01:04:37.616
Anyway, I hear you have
a special talent.

01:04:38.533 --> 01:04:42.033
Right now it feels more
like a curse.

01:04:42.491 --> 01:04:43.989
Well, I've heard differently.

01:04:43.991 --> 01:04:46.198
That's what I came
to talk to you about.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.991
I'm tired of talking.

01:04:49.491 --> 01:04:54.200
But you're a Raconteur.
Talking's what you do.

01:04:54.825 --> 01:04:57.823
Don't worry,
I'll make it worth your while.

01:04:57.825 --> 01:05:00.114
I don't want your money.

01:05:00.116 --> 01:05:03.283
We'll see about that.

01:05:08.366 --> 01:05:11.950
Come on. Let's get outta here.

01:05:17.741 --> 01:05:20.533
You coming or what?

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:37.489
Take this.

01:05:37.491 --> 01:05:42.575
You get paid to talk.
I'm paying you to talk.

01:05:52.116 --> 01:05:53.323
OK.

01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:56.989
I can't look at art.
It makes me sick.

01:05:56.991 --> 01:06:00.781
- Proper art, I mean.
- Go on.

01:06:00.783 --> 01:06:03.448
Depending on the quality
of the work,

01:06:03.450 --> 01:06:05.948
I get dizzy spells, blackouts.

01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:08.906
If it's beautiful,
if it's a proper masterpiece,

01:06:08.908 --> 01:06:11.739
I faint
and imagine myself in it.

01:06:11.741 --> 01:06:15.575
- You taking the piss?
- No, I'm not.

01:06:16.116 --> 01:06:20.948
And if you saw a fake,
what would happen then?

01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:21.781
What do you mean, a fake?

01:06:21.783 --> 01:06:27.866
I mean, if someone tried
to pass off a fake as genuine,

01:06:28.075 --> 01:06:29.656
what would happen then?

01:06:29.658 --> 01:06:32.073
Nothing would happen, I suppose.

01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:34.614
So you wouldn't react
in the same way?

01:06:34.616 --> 01:06:37.198
You don't understand.
I'm not experienced.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.239
This is more
of an emotional reaction.

01:06:39.241 --> 01:06:41.281
It's not something
I can control.

01:06:41.283 --> 01:06:42.073
It just... happens.

01:06:42.075 --> 01:06:45.656
You realise there's serious
money to be made out of this?

01:06:45.658 --> 01:06:48.364
You can't make money
out of a sickness.

01:06:48.991 --> 01:06:54.408
You can make money out of
anything these days, believe me.

01:06:58.116 --> 01:07:00.366
Call me tomorrow night.

01:07:01.783 --> 01:07:03.573
Why? Am I leaving?

01:07:03.575 --> 01:07:06.158
I didn't say that.

01:07:14.116 --> 01:07:14.781
I used to think an image

01:07:14.783 --> 01:07:18.073
could tell you everything you
needed to know about a person.

01:07:18.075 --> 01:07:20.906
An image can tell you
everything.

01:07:20.908 --> 01:07:23.448
Or it can tell you
nothing at all.

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:29.073
An image can reveal a person
or... could hide a person.

01:07:29.075 --> 01:07:31.823
You should know that.

01:07:31.825 --> 01:07:34.281
And what does this one tell you?

01:07:34.283 --> 01:07:37.198
It tells you
to forget about him.

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.741
That person doesn't exist
any more.

01:08:24.491 --> 01:08:25.738
Thanks for coming.

01:08:25.741 --> 01:08:28.198
No worries.
What are we doing here?

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:31.156
We're gonna look
at paintings.

01:08:31.158 --> 01:08:34.363
So do you want sex before,
during or after?

01:08:34.366 --> 01:08:35.156
Very smart.

01:08:35.158 --> 01:08:37.573
I'm particularly strong
on early Baroque.

01:08:37.575 --> 01:08:39.488
Caravaggio's
a personal favourite

01:08:39.491 --> 01:08:41.448
but, you choose.
It's your money.

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:43.406
You're in a good mood.

01:08:43.408 --> 01:08:44.906
I had fun the other night.

01:08:44.908 --> 01:08:49.031
We're gonna see
just how talented you are.

01:08:49.033 --> 01:08:51.863
It's not a talent I've got,
it's a sickness.

01:08:51.866 --> 01:08:54.156
You need to stop thinking
about it as a sickness

01:08:54.158 --> 01:08:56.281
and look at it more
as a business opportunity.

01:08:56.283 --> 01:08:59.031
I've told you already.
Money doesn't interest me.

01:08:59.033 --> 01:09:01.573
Well, you may not
be interested in money

01:09:01.575 --> 01:09:04.031
but money is interested in you.

01:09:04.033 --> 01:09:06.738
The people I represent
bought this painting

01:09:06.741 --> 01:09:08.238
and it cost them a fortune.

01:09:08.241 --> 01:09:13.075
Now there's a question
about its authenticity.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:22.866
It's more beautiful
than I ever imagined.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.408
What can you tell me?

01:09:27.241 --> 01:09:28.448
Jim?

01:09:28.450 --> 01:09:31.033
Is it the real thing or not?

01:09:38.116 --> 01:09:40.533
He's fainted.

01:09:40.825 --> 01:09:42.156
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

01:09:42.158 --> 01:09:45.866
He... he's fainted.
He... he's out cold.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.698
It's a great thing.

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:52.823
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

01:09:52.825 --> 01:09:54.448
Always talking.
This boy never shuts up.

01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:56.823
It's like working with
a spoilt child. I can't listen.

01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:59.864
Just one question, then I'll
leave you alone, I promise.

01:09:59.866 --> 01:10:03.823
I'd tread very carefully,
if I were you.

01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:05.364
It's just there's been
a lot of debate

01:10:05.366 --> 01:10:07.656
about your sexuality
amongst art critics.

01:10:07.658 --> 01:10:09.323
It's the way you paint
young blokes.

01:10:09.325 --> 01:10:11.406
That's it!
I've had enough of this shit.

01:10:11.408 --> 01:10:13.156
I can't work
with this kid any more.

01:10:13.158 --> 01:10:14.531
That was a legitimate question.

01:10:14.533 --> 01:10:15.989
Your sexuality's
been hotly debated

01:10:15.991 --> 01:10:17.989
since your art's
been rediscovered

01:10:17.991 --> 01:10:18.948
in the 18th century.

01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:20.156
He is beautiful,
I give you that.

01:10:20.158 --> 01:10:24.448
Just look...
My gosh, this boy's the devil.

01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:29.406
No one calls me "frocio"
and gets away with it.

01:10:29.408 --> 01:10:30.156
I've killed men for less.

01:10:30.158 --> 01:10:33.364
I can't fight with you.
You're my favourite artist.

01:10:33.366 --> 01:10:36.364
You know nothing about art.
Nothing.

01:10:36.366 --> 01:10:40.114
All you know, you've read in
a book in a library somewhere.

01:10:40.116 --> 01:10:41.656
You can't understand art

01:10:41.658 --> 01:10:43.989
unless you know
what it's like to suffer.

01:10:43.991 --> 01:10:45.614
London...

01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:50.739
Oh, fuck London! Who gives
a shit about London?

01:10:50.741 --> 01:10:51.614
Name me one great artist

01:10:51.616 --> 01:10:55.198
that ever came out
of that stinking backwater!

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:58.781
Erm... Francis Bacon,
Lucian Freud...

01:10:58.783 --> 01:11:03.114
Never heard of them. See?
I told you. You know nothing.

01:11:03.116 --> 01:11:05.739
This is Naples now, my boy.

01:11:05.741 --> 01:11:07.489
And this is my home town.

01:11:07.491 --> 01:11:11.073
So, come on. Prove you're a man.

01:11:11.075 --> 01:11:12.906
You can't be serious.

01:11:12.908 --> 01:11:16.739
I think you'll find that if
someone from 17th-century Naples

01:11:16.741 --> 01:11:20.989
challenges you to a duel,
you are duty-bound to accept.

01:11:20.991 --> 01:11:23.948
But we're not in Naples,
we're in my dream.

01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:24.823
Try telling him that.

01:11:24.825 --> 01:11:26.698
Stop talking about him
like he's real.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.531
He's a figment
of my imagination.

01:11:28.533 --> 01:11:30.364
The sooner
you get this over with,

01:11:30.366 --> 01:11:31.614
the sooner you get out of here.

01:11:31.616 --> 01:11:33.156
Someone wake me up, please!

01:11:55.825 --> 01:11:58.408
Who's the vulture now, eh?

01:11:59.116 --> 01:12:01.156
Pretty boy.

01:12:01.158 --> 01:12:04.364
Jim, wake up.

01:12:04.366 --> 01:12:06.575
Jim.

01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:11.783
Are you OK?

01:12:12.075 --> 01:12:14.283
I think so, yeah.

01:12:14.408 --> 01:12:15.781
That was a close shave.

01:12:15.783 --> 01:12:18.908
Thought I'd lost you
for a minute.

01:12:21.866 --> 01:12:24.491
You cut yourself.

01:12:29.283 --> 01:12:32.823
I could feel the blade
on my skin.

01:12:32.825 --> 01:12:35.281
I really thought
he was gonna kill me.

01:12:35.283 --> 01:12:36.823
- Who?
- Caravaggio.

01:12:36.825 --> 01:12:38.948
I thought he was gonna kill me.

01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:42.114
This is fucking great.

01:12:42.116 --> 01:12:43.489
It's not funny.

01:12:43.491 --> 01:12:47.616
That bloke has got
serious mental health issues.

01:12:49.366 --> 01:12:52.906
Take this as a down payment.

01:12:52.908 --> 01:12:54.156
Down payment for what?

01:12:54.158 --> 01:12:56.614
Never you mind about that.

01:12:56.616 --> 01:12:59.450
You need to get some rest.

01:13:00.241 --> 01:13:02.114
We've got work to do.

01:13:08.075 --> 01:13:10.239
Been anywhere interesting?

01:13:10.241 --> 01:13:11.364
Just a regular client.

01:13:11.366 --> 01:13:14.239
Go on. Explain yourself.
We're listening.

01:13:14.241 --> 01:13:16.781
What is there to explain?
The money was for sex.

01:13:16.783 --> 01:13:19.156
Of all the fit blokes in London,
why go with him?

01:13:19.158 --> 01:13:21.156
We never exchanged a word,
I swear.

01:13:21.158 --> 01:13:23.323
You had everything
going for you.

01:13:23.325 --> 01:13:24.281
Why sell your soul to the devil?

01:13:24.283 --> 01:13:26.198
He's not the devil.
He just works in the City.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:31.948
How could you do this to us?
I thought we were friends.

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:33.991
We are friends.

01:13:40.908 --> 01:13:42.323
We warned you
that not every night

01:13:42.325 --> 01:13:43.364
will be the night
of your dreams.

01:13:43.366 --> 01:13:47.156
Patience is a virtue, my friend,
especially in the art world.

01:13:47.158 --> 01:13:51.198
Van Gogh didn't make it big
until he was dead.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.114
Is that such a good thing?

01:13:52.116 --> 01:13:54.448
Don't be too smart
for your own good.

01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:57.198
You think the boys
and Caravaggio had an easy time?

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.823
No, they didn't.
They were living on the street.

01:13:59.825 --> 01:14:01.489
But they will be
remembered forever.

01:14:01.491 --> 01:14:03.823
Don't talk about Caravaggio.
He does my head in.

01:14:03.825 --> 01:14:06.323
Some of the finest artists
in London

01:14:06.325 --> 01:14:07.448
are queueing to paint you.

01:14:07.450 --> 01:14:09.531
Isn't immortality
good enough for you?

01:14:09.533 --> 01:14:11.489
Look, I'm not knocking
immortality.

01:14:11.491 --> 01:14:15.031
Maybe it's just not for me,
is what I'm saying.

01:14:15.033 --> 01:14:18.864
Look, I know
I sound ungrateful but...

01:14:18.866 --> 01:14:20.656
I wanna do my own thing.

01:14:20.658 --> 01:14:23.575
I wanna discover my own path.

01:14:23.866 --> 01:14:28.491
I couldn't help overhearing
what you were saying.

01:14:28.908 --> 01:14:31.489
You're the bloke
that took Soho by storm

01:14:31.491 --> 01:14:34.033
and then it all went tits up.

01:14:34.908 --> 01:14:36.239
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

01:14:36.241 --> 01:14:39.031
Well, you must have heard of
The Shock of the New.

01:14:39.033 --> 01:14:41.198
- Of course, yeah.
- Just think about it.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.364
When people
first encountered modernism,

01:14:43.366 --> 01:14:47.323
a lot of them became disturbed.
Properly went mental.

01:14:47.325 --> 01:14:49.114
- Like me, you mean?
- Exactly.

01:14:49.116 --> 01:14:53.239
Your average Joe Bloggs couldn't
understand artists like Picasso.

01:14:53.241 --> 01:14:54.114
Nor do I, to tell you the truth.

01:14:54.116 --> 01:14:57.156
People had never seen
images like that before

01:14:57.158 --> 01:14:58.531
and got properly freaked out.

01:14:58.533 --> 01:14:59.656
It's as though art itself

01:14:59.658 --> 01:15:02.073
had been reinvented
for the modern world.

01:15:02.075 --> 01:15:04.031
For the new age
of mass production.

01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:07.281
When you think about the whole
sweep of human history,

01:15:07.283 --> 01:15:08.864
when you really think about it,

01:15:08.866 --> 01:15:09.781
it's only up until recently

01:15:09.783 --> 01:15:12.198
that people were living
in the Dark Ages.

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:12.906
What did they do for fun?

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:16.031
They read books, they went to
the opera, and shit like that.

01:15:16.033 --> 01:15:18.323
And they put pen to paper
and wrote letters.

01:15:18.325 --> 01:15:20.989
At the weekend
they went to the local tavern

01:15:20.991 --> 01:15:23.114
for something
called a sing-song.

01:15:23.116 --> 01:15:25.156
Most of them believed in God.

01:15:25.158 --> 01:15:26.489
It was the age of innocence.

01:15:26.491 --> 01:15:30.989
And the Raconteurs, your mates,
are part of that tradition.

01:15:30.991 --> 01:15:32.573
They might carry mobile phones

01:15:32.575 --> 01:15:36.573
but really they're still living
in the last century.

01:15:36.575 --> 01:15:37.198
I guess so.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.739
Your mates have given you
a great education,

01:15:39.741 --> 01:15:42.948
but it's time to take it
to the next level.

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:45.448
Time to embrace
the 21st century.

01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:49.656
And we'll teach you
everything we know.

01:15:49.658 --> 01:15:50.948
I like what you're saying

01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:52.698
but I can't learn any more
at this point.

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:54.531
My brain's full
and I need a rest.

01:15:54.533 --> 01:15:56.489
We understand
where you're coming from.

01:15:56.491 --> 01:15:59.739
But the point is that maybe
the shock, the rupture,

01:15:59.741 --> 01:16:01.198
could be used in a good way.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.614
- To help you.
- Like therapy?

01:16:03.616 --> 01:16:06.614
Yeah. Like therapy.

01:16:06.616 --> 01:16:09.198
Confront yourself
with modern art,

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:10.948
find some really fucked-up shit,

01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:13.989
look at it and see what happens.

01:16:13.991 --> 01:16:16.031
Hmm.

01:16:16.033 --> 01:16:18.533
Excuse me.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:19.489
Hello?

01:16:19.491 --> 01:16:25.741
No, I didn't forget. No. I'll be
with you as soon as I can. Bye.

01:16:26.366 --> 01:16:31.783
I'll think about what you said,
but right now I've gotta run.

01:16:35.033 --> 01:16:38.825
I think he's the one
we've been looking for.

01:16:39.408 --> 01:16:42.531
- Thanks for coming back.
- I need to make some money.

01:16:42.533 --> 01:16:44.948
That's a language
I can understand.

01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:46.239
It's not what you think.

01:16:46.241 --> 01:16:47.198
Hello, Jim.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:49.239
Paul was impressed
by your talent last time

01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:52.739
and so we thought we might look
at a series of paintings

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:54.656
and see what your reaction is.

01:16:54.658 --> 01:16:57.073
You mean, see if
they're worth any money?

01:16:57.075 --> 01:17:00.614
Well, that's to put it
rather crudely, but yes.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:03.114
You could see it as a service
to the community.

01:17:03.116 --> 01:17:05.156
How do you work that one out?

01:17:05.158 --> 01:17:08.156
Well, it's important that people
can distinguish

01:17:08.158 --> 01:17:13.656
between what is real
and what is fake, after all.

01:17:13.658 --> 01:17:15.406
- I really shouldn't be here.
- Look...

01:17:15.408 --> 01:17:20.075
Stop beating yourself up.
Let's just get on with it.

01:17:21.616 --> 01:17:24.366
Come here.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.823
Don't feel
you have to rush, Jim.

01:17:29.825 --> 01:17:34.950
If it comes,
it comes. Take your time.

01:17:38.575 --> 01:17:43.616
- Is this a good sign?
- It's a great sign.

01:17:47.658 --> 01:17:49.823
What does it mean?

01:17:49.825 --> 01:17:52.073
It means it's a genuine Titian.

01:17:52.075 --> 01:17:56.575
Great work.
Just a couple more to go.

01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.658
It's beautiful.

01:18:16.908 --> 01:18:19.448
It's by Giorgione. Are you sure?

01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:24.741
With a reaction like that,
it must be genuine.

01:18:40.283 --> 01:18:42.448
- I need to stop now.
- Just a couple more.

01:18:42.450 --> 01:18:46.906
- It won't take long.
- No, please, I need to stop.

01:18:46.908 --> 01:18:48.989
- Take that.
- I need to stop right now!

01:18:48.991 --> 01:18:53.491
Where are you going?
Jim! Wait! Where are you...?

01:18:59.866 --> 01:19:01.783
Sorry, mate.

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:08.239
You know nothing
about art. Nothing.

01:19:08.241 --> 01:19:14.283
Anything you know, you read in
a book in a library somewhere.

01:19:17.741 --> 01:19:18.989
Name me one great artist

01:19:18.991 --> 01:19:22.700
who came from
that stinking backwater.

01:19:25.783 --> 01:19:27.156
You can't understand art

01:19:27.158 --> 01:19:31.366
unless you know
what it's like to suffer.

01:19:55.908 --> 01:19:58.906
Stop looking
so sorry for yourself.

01:19:58.908 --> 01:20:02.366
No one said
being a muse was easy.

01:20:02.533 --> 01:20:04.281
I'm not a muse any more.

01:20:04.283 --> 01:20:08.031
Inspiring great art
isn't something you choose.

01:20:08.033 --> 01:20:09.156
It just happens.

01:20:09.158 --> 01:20:10.281
You're stuck with it.

01:20:10.283 --> 01:20:11.864
Like your looks,
until they fade,

01:20:11.866 --> 01:20:13.531
which, believe me, they will.

01:20:13.533 --> 01:20:14.156
Thanks for the tip.

01:20:14.158 --> 01:20:18.825
Look, just get back out there
and enjoy it while it lasts.

01:20:27.866 --> 01:20:30.031
Yes, there were five of us once.

01:20:30.033 --> 01:20:34.656
I was gonna ask. What happened
to the previous lad?

01:20:34.658 --> 01:20:36.739
We don't talk about him
any more.

01:20:36.741 --> 01:20:37.448
But why?

01:20:37.450 --> 01:20:42.033
He was beautiful but he craved
another kind of life.

01:21:28.491 --> 01:21:31.614
For someone's who's riding
such a huge wave of success,

01:21:31.616 --> 01:21:35.489
why do you always manage
to look like shit?

01:21:35.491 --> 01:21:37.239
I've got a lot on my mind.

01:21:37.241 --> 01:21:41.906
Has no one ever talked to you
about the work/life balance?

01:21:41.908 --> 01:21:44.950
I just need to rest, that's all.

01:21:46.616 --> 01:21:50.908
Here. Take this.

01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:52.114
What's this?

01:21:52.116 --> 01:21:55.114
- It's money.
- I know it's money.

01:21:55.116 --> 01:21:57.739
Money's what I've spent
my whole life begging for.

01:21:57.741 --> 01:22:00.781
Well, I've come to tell you
your begging days are over.

01:22:00.783 --> 01:22:02.364
Your days as an artist
have just begun.

01:22:02.366 --> 01:22:05.531
I wish I knew what the fuck
you were talking about.

01:22:05.533 --> 01:22:07.950
I'm talking about your boxes.

01:22:08.783 --> 01:22:09.948
A box, my friend,

01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:13.114
is a place for me to park my
arse whilst I sort my shit out.

01:22:13.116 --> 01:22:15.406
No, it's not.
It's more than that.

01:22:15.408 --> 01:22:16.156
It's a lot more than that.

01:22:16.158 --> 01:22:18.531
I've seen them. Trust me.
I know what I'm talking about.

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:22.406
I don't believe you do know what
the fuck you're talking about.

01:22:22.408 --> 01:22:26.031
But I ain't about to kick
a gift horse in the mouth.

01:22:26.033 --> 01:22:30.616
So I'll accept your kind offer.
All right?

01:22:36.575 --> 01:22:40.450
Anyone fancy a dance?

01:22:40.658 --> 01:22:43.741
Yeah. Why not?

01:23:26.408 --> 01:23:28.073
Amazing, these blokes.

01:23:28.075 --> 01:23:32.739
But I've been thinking,
the time for dancing is over.

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:35.156
The time for action
has arrived.

01:23:35.158 --> 01:23:38.156
I came down here
looking for adventure.

01:23:38.158 --> 01:23:40.656
And what I found was friendship

01:23:40.658 --> 01:23:42.073
and beauty.

01:23:42.075 --> 01:23:43.906
Other people's beauty.

01:23:43.908 --> 01:23:49.616
That might be enough for
some people, but not for me.

01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:53.116
I want to create my own beauty.

01:23:53.658 --> 01:23:55.614
And I think I'm ready now.
