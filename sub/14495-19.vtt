00:00.026 --> 00:01.926
Previously on Avengers...

00:02.427 --> 00:04.827
Vision, you saved all of us.

00:04.828 --> 00:05.926
Why?

00:05.927 --> 00:08.621
Ultron created me to be perfect.

00:08.622 --> 00:10.817
He thought that meant less human.

00:11.117 --> 00:12.612
I wish to be perfect.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.707
But i believe that means to be more human.

00:16.206 --> 00:18.601
I'm inventing technology for the next century.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.999
Trying to make the world a better place.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.796
The newpaper calls you a futurist.

00:21.797 --> 00:24.591
Taking on SHIELD,
giant robots, super-villains...

00:24.592 --> 00:27.584
The whole world doesn't have to rest 
on your shoulders.

00:27.585 --> 00:28.882
Yeah, it does.

00:29.581 --> 00:32.573
You really think you can fix it, Iron Man?

00:32.575 --> 00:34.570
Cap, come on, it's me.

00:35.171 --> 00:36.866
How are you feeling, Vision?

00:36.867 --> 00:39.361
It is an odd sensation.

00:39.362 --> 00:41.558
Am i being scanned as well?

00:41.559 --> 00:43.554
Yeah, sorry about that.
We need to be sure...

00:43.555 --> 00:45.550
that Ultron didn't leave
any surprises inside you.

00:45.950 --> 00:48.942
I'm not worried.
Vision is  *** now.

00:48.943 --> 00:50.440
I'll give Ultron credit.

00:50.441 --> 00:52.138
He made an amazing job designing you.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.334
I wish the world was that easy to fix.

00:54.335 --> 00:56.129
And trust me, I've been trying.

00:56.130 --> 00:59.524
JARVIS, begin auto repair sequence, now.

00:59.525 --> 01:00.822
Activating.

01:05.810 --> 01:07.407
Entering sleep mode.

01:08.406 --> 01:11.399
We'll see you in 30 days, Vision.
Rest.

01:16.089 --> 01:18.084
Resuming normal function.

01:19.882 --> 01:21.577
I am complete.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.173
Hello?

01:24.174 --> 01:27.465
Iron Man?
Captain America?

02:25.134 --> 02:28.426
Congratulations, Iron Man.
You did it.

02:28.427 --> 02:30.422
You fixed the world.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.526
Subtitles: Nakor38

02:33.527 --> 02:35.503
And there came a day, unlike any other

02:35.504 --> 02:37.197
When Earth mightiest heroes

02:37.198 --> 02:39.738
Found themselves united
against a common threat.

02:39.739 --> 02:42.846
On that day, they became the Avengers!

02:42.847 --> 02:44.825
The invincible armored Iron Man!

02:49.625 --> 02:52.730
And Captain America, the first Avenger!

02:52.731 --> 02:55.929
Assembled, we are strong!

02:55.930 --> 02:59.226
Forever fight as one!

02:59.227 --> 03:01.580
Avengers, assemble!

03:19.824 --> 03:22.319
Contact all Avengers via ID card.

03:23.417 --> 03:24.714
JARVIS?

03:26.212 --> 03:29.704
Activating artificial intelligence.
Designation: JARVIS

03:33.995 --> 03:35.591
Resuming functions.

03:35.592 --> 03:37.388
Reboot complete.

03:38.088 --> 03:40.383
Hello, Vision.
May i help you?

03:40.384 --> 03:41.880
Why were you deactivated?

03:41.881 --> 03:45.074
All artificial intelligence systems
where shut down by Iron Man.

03:45.075 --> 03:47.370
- 14 days ago.
- By Iron Man?

03:47.371 --> 03:48.967
I do not understand.

03:48.968 --> 03:51.962
JARVIS, what happened
while i was being repaired?

03:51.963 --> 03:54.057
When did everything changed?

03:56.852 --> 03:58.648
25 days ago

03:58.649 --> 04:01.941
Tony Stark created and launched
a prototype satellite he designed.

04:01.943 --> 04:04.437
To generate and transmit 
free energy to the world.

04:04.439 --> 04:06.533
The Stark Energizer.

04:06.734 --> 04:10.126
23 days ago, Tony Stark
addressed the United Nations.

04:10.127 --> 04:11.723
By the end of his speech

04:11.724 --> 04:15.416
the organization voted to disband
leaving Mr Stark in charge.

04:15.816 --> 04:17.113
Within the week

04:17.113 --> 04:19.808
Stark Industries took over 
all the funcions of the UN.

04:19.809 --> 04:21.904
And Iron Man began to send squadrons...

04:21.904 --> 04:23.801
of remotely controlled Iron Man armors.

04:23.802 --> 04:26.496
Along with members of the Avengers
all around the world.

04:26.996 --> 04:29.491
Their mission was to end war.

04:29.492 --> 04:31.487
The majority surrendered.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.982
Additionally, Stark Industries facilities...

04:33.983 --> 04:35.479
were opened across the globe.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.174
Any remaining resistance was crushed

04:38.974 --> 04:40.570
Where are the Avengers now?

04:41.569 --> 04:43.864
Yellow Jacket is presently in London.

04:43.865 --> 04:45.860
Supervising the european continent.

04:45.861 --> 04:48.156
Miss Marvel oversees South America

04:48.157 --> 04:50.053
Wasp is in Asia.
and the Black Panther...

04:50.054 --> 04:51.351
Who is in New York?

04:51.352 --> 04:53.846
Thor himself is Iron Man's bodyguard

04:53.847 --> 04:55.943
Hawkeye oversees the Iron Men.

04:55.943 --> 04:57.939
And Captain America is behind you.

05:01.930 --> 05:04.225
What are you doing here, Vision?

05:04.226 --> 05:05.823
You're supposed to be shut down!

05:05.824 --> 05:08.518
Captain...
The repair program...

05:08.519 --> 05:09.815
It finished.

05:11.314 --> 05:13.608
Access to the Mansion is against the law!

05:13.610 --> 05:16.303
Use of artificial intelligence
is against the law!

05:16.304 --> 05:19.297
I do not understand
Why are you doing this?

05:19.298 --> 05:21.494
Why is Iron Man taking these...

05:21.495 --> 05:23.490
They are *** to everything i know bout...

05:23.491 --> 05:25.287
That is not to be questionned

05:25.886 --> 05:27.383
I follow orders!

05:28.780 --> 05:30.876
And you're getting shut down,
Mister!

05:35.866 --> 05:37.661
No, this is not right.

05:37.662 --> 05:39.259
This is not what you believe

05:48.140 --> 05:50.634
JARVIS, I am transmitting audio 
and visual records..

05:50.635 --> 05:52.929
from my internal memory
project them.

05:53.929 --> 05:55.924
You think i'm fighting for me?

05:55.925 --> 05:57.920
To save my own life?

05:58.620 --> 06:00.216
That's why you'll never win!

06:00.217 --> 06:01.814
I'm not fighting for me!

06:01.815 --> 06:03.511
I fight for them!

06:03.811 --> 06:06.804
That's something you'll never understand, machine!

06:07.404 --> 06:10.097
It's the very thing that makes us human.

06:16.484 --> 06:17.781
Captain?

06:17.782 --> 06:20.077
AI designation: Vision.

06:20.078 --> 06:22.373
You are to surrender
by the order of Iron Man.

06:22.374 --> 06:25.367
I... will... not!

06:29.160 --> 06:30.756
Never surrender!

06:30.757 --> 06:33.052
Not until we stop Stark!

06:33.053 --> 06:34.450
I don't get it.

06:34.451 --> 06:36.346
This is *** from Cap's Iron Men

06:36.347 --> 06:39.141
Why would he do this
Doesn't make sense.

06:39.142 --> 06:40.738
I agree

06:41.138 --> 06:43.134
It doesn't make sense at all.

06:43.634 --> 06:46.527
You've created the perfect world,
Tony.

06:47.027 --> 06:50.719
People should just sit back and enjoy it.

07:27.427 --> 07:30.426
These things are tough
but still not the real deal.

07:30.427 --> 07:31.725
We got lucky.

07:31.726 --> 07:34.725
Attention: more Iron Men are approaching.

07:34.726 --> 07:36.424
Two of the unit... Erro.

07:36.425 --> 07:38.025
Remote shutdown in progress.

07:38.026 --> 07:39.325
It's Tony!

07:39.326 --> 07:41.624
JARVIS, begin uploading to my mainframe.

07:41.625 --> 07:42.725
Uploading.

07:42.726 --> 07:44.324
Upload complete.

07:44.325 --> 07:45.625
Hello

07:51.622 --> 07:54.522
- We have to get to the Quinjet!
- ill advised, sir.

07:54.523 --> 07:56.421
The Quinjets have been moved off site.

08:08.415 --> 08:10.114
How did this happen?

08:10.115 --> 08:12.413
It was like i was in a fog.

08:12.414 --> 08:14.714
I am detecting an unknown energy 
throughout the city.

08:14.715 --> 08:18.011
Possibly the world.
You are being affected as well.

08:18.012 --> 08:20.511
- What is it?
- Analyzing.

08:21.012 --> 08:22.310
Match found.

08:22.311 --> 08:25.310
The energy has the same effect on human biology...

08:25.311 --> 08:27.610
As the power of Zebediah Killgrave.

08:27.611 --> 08:29.609
AKA : The Purple Man.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.808
Purple Man : that name... it sounds...

08:33.208 --> 08:34.508
Oh, no!

08:34.509 --> 08:36.808
The same day Tony was fixing you, Vision...

08:36.808 --> 08:38.308
An Avengers alert came in.

08:38.710 --> 08:40.008
It was Purple Man.

08:40.009 --> 08:42.008
The Purple Man was apprehended.

08:42.009 --> 08:44.307
With Mr Stark usual flair.

08:44.308 --> 08:46.607
He was handed over to SHIELD.

08:46.608 --> 08:49.007
I think we can safely assume
that it didn't last.

08:49.008 --> 08:50.307
What happened next?

08:50.308 --> 08:51.707
Six hours later...

08:51.709 --> 08:54.406
Pepper Potts ordered all audio video recording...

08:54.407 --> 08:56.107
in Stark Tower shut down.

08:56.108 --> 08:59.106
She said that Mr Stark had a guest.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.204
Within a small radius surrounding...

09:02.205 --> 09:05.504
the Purple Man can control
the wills of other human beings.

09:05.505 --> 09:08.502
They will do anything and everything
the Purple Man says...

09:08.503 --> 09:09.803
without question.

09:09.804 --> 09:11.703
And the first thing he made Tony do...

09:11.704 --> 09:13.702
was to build a satellite
that would transmit his power...

09:13.703 --> 09:15.202
over the entire world.

09:15.904 --> 09:18.201
There is our problem.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.899
What do you mean they got away?

09:22.900 --> 09:26.299
Find them!
Hunt them down and destroy them!

09:32.296 --> 09:35.694
You're trying to resist me,
aren't you?

09:37.094 --> 09:40.093
No one can resist me at this range.

09:40.094 --> 09:41.393
Satellite or not.

09:41.893 --> 09:45.191
Look at you.
The noble hero.

09:45.192 --> 09:48.990
Don't pretend like all of this wasn't your idea 
in the first place!

09:48.991 --> 09:51.489
Everything i've made you do
in the last few weeks...

09:51.490 --> 09:53.489
It all came from you.

09:53.490 --> 09:55.989
I just gave you the push you needed.

09:56.390 --> 09:59.287
For so long i've been able to take
anything i wanted.

09:59.288 --> 10:01.087
But it wasn't enough.

10:01.088 --> 10:04.387
I should have been able to rule the world
with my power!

10:04.787 --> 10:06.786
And through you,
Stark...

10:07.086 --> 10:09.186
That's exactly what i am doing!

10:09.686 --> 10:12.684
You can have it all
anytime you want it.

10:13.384 --> 10:16.383
Everybody listens to Tony Stark.

10:16.384 --> 10:19.382
Everybody loves Iron Man.

10:19.982 --> 10:21.881
You shouldn't have mocked me.

10:21.882 --> 10:25.280
You thought it would be funny
that day in the restaurant, didn't you?

10:25.281 --> 10:26.780
To make fun of me!

10:26.781 --> 10:28.280
To make me look stupid!

10:28.281 --> 10:31.379
Do you feel smart now?

10:32.380 --> 10:35.078
We've got a visual on Captain America and The Vision.

10:35.079 --> 10:36.679
What are your orders?

10:36.680 --> 10:39.677
Eliminate Captain America and The Vision.

10:39.678 --> 10:41.278
Now.

10:46.775 --> 10:49.274
Take...them...down.

10:51.273 --> 10:53.672
We need to fight this on two fronts.

10:56.671 --> 10:57.970
Vision!

11:00.769 --> 11:02.469
That was a free ***, old man.

11:02.470 --> 11:05.568
I just wanted to make sure you knew 
it was me taking you down.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.325
Sorry, robot, you break the law
i break you.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.517
Each statement you just made is incorrect

11:17.518 --> 11:18.989
I am not a robot...

11:18.990 --> 11:21.721
And you cannot break
what you cannot touch.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.527
For your own sake, please, stop.

11:29.983 --> 11:31.846
Thanks for the concern!

11:37.695 --> 11:39.066
My apologies.

11:39.067 --> 11:41.097
But your file indicates that my laser...

11:41.098 --> 11:43.256
will not permanently harm you.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.431
Bye bye.

12:02.009 --> 12:05.425
Hawkeye! Clint!
You can fight this!

12:14.200 --> 12:16.490
It's over, Cap, you loose!

12:16.491 --> 12:19.462
You're being used, Hawkeye!
by the Purple Man!

12:19.463 --> 12:21.152
You think i'm gonna listen to you?

12:21.153 --> 12:22.700
Stark said you were a traitor.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.463
So i'm taking you down.

12:24.464 --> 12:26.241
You've never listened to anyone.

12:26.242 --> 12:28.920
Not me and sure *** Iron Man!

12:28.921 --> 12:31.838
And now you're just gonna blindly follow orders?

12:31.839 --> 12:33.979
You've never done that in your life.

12:33.980 --> 12:38.068
And now you're gonna get yourself killed
because Tony Stark told you to.

12:38.068 --> 12:40.181
No one tells Hawkeye what to do!

12:40.182 --> 12:41.968
Come on, Clint!

12:56.966 --> 12:59.372
Cap?
Hawkeye?

13:00.091 --> 13:02.396
No. No!

13:05.858 --> 13:07.236
You OK, soldier?

13:08.125 --> 13:12.255
No, not until i have Purple Man's head on my wall

13:12.256 --> 13:14.708
Even if we have to go through Dtark to do it.

13:14.709 --> 13:16.888
Cap, what are we gonna do?

13:16.889 --> 13:19.214
The Purple Man, he's taken the whole world.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.741
We take it back.

13:20.742 --> 13:23.576
I need you Hawkeye and Vision
to find a Quinjet.

13:23.577 --> 13:26.561
There's a satellite up in space
that needs to be taken down.

13:26.562 --> 13:28.373
And what of you, Captain?

13:28.373 --> 13:30.475
I'm gonna save Tony.

13:50.376 --> 13:52.479
That was the minimal difficulty.

13:52.879 --> 13:55.047
Did you just say this was easy?

13:55.048 --> 13:56.724
You never say it was easy.

13:56.725 --> 13:59.074
- Ever!
- Why?

14:03.280 --> 14:06.266
Your end has come, betrayers!

14:07.004 --> 14:08.571
That's why.

14:14.327 --> 14:17.306
Hey, Cap, i've been waiting for you.

14:21.027 --> 14:24.438
Iron Man, Tony, you can fight this.

14:24.439 --> 14:26.633
You're being controlled by the Purple Man.

14:40.968 --> 14:42.696
I'm impressed, Captain.

14:42.697 --> 14:44.958
You must have quite the will power...

14:44.959 --> 14:47.367
To keep resisting me like this.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.698
But what do you think you're going to do?

14:50.699 --> 14:52.641
Even if you're going out of here alive...

14:52.643 --> 14:56.592
I control the whole world.

15:18.929 --> 15:21.353
This is bad, what are we supposed to do?

15:21.354 --> 15:22.693
We stick to the plan.

15:22.694 --> 15:24.888
Vision, keep him busy as long as you can.

15:24.889 --> 15:26.411
Keep him right here.

15:36.017 --> 15:37.609
Forgive me, Asgardian.

15:40.994 --> 15:43.730
Vision isn't gonna last long
against blondie out there.

16:26.467 --> 16:29.275
I can't, i can't.

16:29.860 --> 16:32.422
Warning, sensors indicate
multiple Iron Men...

16:32.423 --> 16:33.830
on guard of the satellite.

16:33.831 --> 16:35.507
- That's bad.
- Warning.

16:35.508 --> 16:38.384
Long range sesors indicate
Thor is in pursuit.

16:38.385 --> 16:39.936
That's worse.

16:54.650 --> 16:57.371
JARVIS where's Thor?
how close is he?

16:57.372 --> 17:01.202
- I will deal with Thor.
- What? Vision, wait.

17:05.099 --> 17:06.421
Increasing density.

17:06.422 --> 17:09.354
Current weight, 500 tons.

17:35.289 --> 17:37.727
Now, this is entertainment.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.653
Got it.

17:47.654 --> 17:50.064
Carol, hold her steady.

17:54.723 --> 17:56.907
I don't know how you tricked me Hawkeye.

17:58.664 --> 18:00.960
But i won't betray Iron Man!

18:00.961 --> 18:02.331
Carol...

18:02.554 --> 18:05.130
You have to fight.

18:21.573 --> 18:23.122
Clint?

18:28.438 --> 18:29.757
Vision?

18:29.758 --> 18:31.497
What transpires here?

18:31.498 --> 18:34.520
It would seem that Hawkeye and Miss Marvel
were successful.

18:34.521 --> 18:37.282
You are now free of the Purple Man's influence.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.655
Purple Man?

18:39.449 --> 18:41.372
Purple Man!

18:44.821 --> 18:48.396
Tony, you have to fight!
you can beat this!

18:53.205 --> 18:54.744
Look at him, Stark.

18:54.745 --> 18:56.870
I want you to feel ***.

18:56.871 --> 19:00.700
I want you to know exactly
what i am making you do.

19:02.079 --> 19:04.627
- Cap?
- you're mine, Stark!

19:04.628 --> 19:05.937
For ever!

19:05.938 --> 19:09.080
No matter how hard you resist,
you'll never be free.

19:09.081 --> 19:12.084
The most you'll ever be able to do
is to wave your finger...

19:12.085 --> 19:13.454
when i'm next to you.

19:13.455 --> 19:15.473
Now, finish him.

19:21.576 --> 19:23.845
Artificial Intelligence reactivated.

19:24.278 --> 19:27.093
Initiating armor air filtration system.

19:46.189 --> 19:50.178
Purple Man, you have made a grave mistake.

19:52.875 --> 19:54.874
Please, please, don't

19:54.875 --> 19:57.249
I can do a lot by waving my finger.

20:06.211 --> 20:08.580
It will take some time
but i will put it right.

20:08.581 --> 20:10.539
Everything i did, i'll fix.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.147
But it will never be enough.

20:12.147 --> 20:13.913
Ever since i became Iron Man...

20:13.915 --> 20:15.725
I tried to make sure the weapons i made...

20:15.726 --> 20:17.376
didn't fall in the wrong hands.

20:17.377 --> 20:19.525
And i was turned into a weapon.

20:19.526 --> 20:21.327
No one blames you Tony.

20:21.328 --> 20:23.665
The world knows it was the Purple Man.

20:23.666 --> 20:25.698
Everyone was in the same boat as you.

20:25.699 --> 20:27.519
He was controlling all of us.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.010
No, you shoot Purple Man's control.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.372
so did the others.

20:31.373 --> 20:34.412
And everything Purple Man had me do
was all inside me

20:34.413 --> 20:36.388
They're all ideas i had.

20:36.390 --> 20:39.461
I'm supposed to be the futurist
working to build a better tomorrow.

20:39.462 --> 20:40.775
What i did?

20:40.776 --> 20:42.819
Is that the future i've been working for?

20:42.820 --> 20:44.585
I don't believe that.

20:44.586 --> 20:47.459
And i don't think it was a mistake
that you forgot about the Vision.

20:47.460 --> 20:50.150
Or that you sent me to the Mansion
the night he woke.

20:50.151 --> 20:52.913
I think you were fighting the Purple Man
the whole time.

20:52.914 --> 20:55.479
I think you hoped the Vision would free me.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.308
I know you believe in the future.

20:57.309 --> 20:59.326
But i believe in people.

20:59.327 --> 21:02.258
And i choose to believe in you Iron Man.
