But there's one last thing
I need to do.

22:58.846 --> 23:01.246
Well, I hope it's not

[ Both laugh ]
Right?

23:03.517 --> 23:05.384
You two have outdone yourselves.
-Man, how awesome is this?

23:05.386 --> 23:06.718
Look at how hot
this chick is.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.119
You're gonna be
so disappointed.

23:08.121 --> 23:09.521

of Riff Raff County, boys!

23:31.612 --> 23:33.278
Shoemaker: Wow!

23:33.280 --> 23:36.481
So, in this scenario,
a duchess was --

23:36.483 --> 23:38.083
-Shut up, Shoemaker.
-Fair enough.

23:38.085 --> 23:39.484
Welcome back,
Queen Bee.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.086
Thank you.

23:41.088 --> 23:42.955

[ Chuckles nervously ]

23:49.830 --> 23:51.430
Mistakes were made,

23:51.432 --> 23:56.435
and I guess we all did
some things we probably regret.

23:56.437 --> 23:57.436
So...

23:57.438 --> 23:58.570
I didn't.

Steven:
Yeah, just you.

23:59.907 --> 24:01.706
You acted like
an immature child, Geoffrey.

24:01.708 --> 24:02.641
Mm-hmm.

24:02.643 --> 24:03.842
And can I assume
that was your feces

24:03.844 --> 24:04.910
I found
on my doorstep?

24:04.912 --> 24:07.112
Okay, well,
you cannot prove that.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.914
It's at the lab
right now.

24:08.916 --> 24:10.381
I'm at my wits' end.

24:10.383 --> 24:11.917
I may have to speak with...

24:11.919 --> 24:13.384
district management.

24:13.386 --> 24:15.587
Okay, well, now, that
vaguely sounds like a threat.

24:15.589 --> 24:17.923
It's not vague at all.
It's a direct threat.

24:17.925 --> 24:19.658
And it -- it is
directed at me?
