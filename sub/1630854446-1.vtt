He's not tough and brawny

- Look, don't worry about me

00:56.639 --> 00:59.142
How was your Thanksgiving?
- Really good.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.019
Wait, did you guys
drive here from Arizona?

01:01.019 --> 01:02.604
Isn't that a long trip?

01:02.604 --> 01:04.939
Yeah, it's 39 hours,
and it felt like a lot more.

01:04.939 --> 01:08.568
Yup, it ended up costing
$1,500 in gas and hotels.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.862
And we got in a couple
really bad arguments.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.535
- Uh, good. We adopted a dog.
- Ooh.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.412
My mom thought it would help
her approval ratings.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.997
It did not.
She returned it.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.791

- She is an amazing woman.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.250

01:45.939 --> 01:47.690

01:47.690 --> 01:49.692
got comfortable,
made myself some snacks.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.110
My parents were, like,
obsessed with me

01:51.110 --> 01:52.487
wearing clothes at home.
- Oh, totally.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.655

- Oh, my God.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.383
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.093
When Kimberly turned
in the stolen test files,

02:15.093 --> 02:17.720
the administration started
an investigation,

02:17.720 --> 02:20.223
and a bunch of senior Thetas
got kicked out.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.642
The seniors?
But they were the hottest ones.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.102

Well, thankfully,
my dad was able to make

02:25.937 --> 02:29.107
a big donation to Cornell and
got him a spot next semester.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.901

to try and cheer him up.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.637
Oh, I couldn't find the right
time to mention it to them.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.764
What do you mean? You were
in the car for 39 hours.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.474
Yeah, don't you need,

to tell your parents.

Well, most of my family's
wealth is tied up

several racehorses.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.712

and I'll get myself out.

Wait, I've got it.
If you need extra money,

03:41.304 --> 03:42.639
you should sell feet pics
on the dark web.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.973
That's certainly

03:43.973 --> 03:45.767
an interesting idea.
- Kimberly, no.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.311
Just go to the financial aid
office and apply for a loan.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.438

You've got long toes,

03:50.438 --> 03:51.564

Everyone,
please give a warm welcome

06:32.809 --> 06:36.479
to our climate refugee, Jackson.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.480
- Hello.
- Wait,

06:37.480 --> 06:38.815
you're the climate refugee?

06:38.815 --> 06:40.024
You're white.
- Bela.

06:40.024 --> 06:42.151

- Sweetheart, um,

06:43.861 --> 06:45.780
and if you're straight

06:45.780 --> 06:48.116
I really don't

06:48.116 --> 06:50.993

06:53.412 --> 06:55.289
That's terrible.
But Frude,

06:55.289 --> 06:56.999
I think the term
"refugee" implies

06:56.999 --> 06:58.584
more of an international displacement.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.212
Uh, Kimberly,
do not offend my new friend.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.588
He's been through enough.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.590
I think climate change is real.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.926
- Yeah, are you serious?
- I didn't say it wasn't.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.886
And speaking
of climate change,

07:08.886 --> 07:11.514
tomorrow's forecast
calls for snow,

07:11.514 --> 07:15.852
which brings with it Essex's
oldest non-racist tradition,

07:15.852 --> 07:17.562
The Annual Snow Run.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.188
Oh, my God!

07:19.188 --> 07:21.190
Is that where we run
in the snow in our underwear?

07:21.190 --> 07:22.692
That is correct.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.193
Should we pregame
or wait till we get there?

07:24.193 --> 07:25.778
Oh, we should absolutely pregame.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.488
The booze in our dorm
is way better.

07:27.488 --> 07:31.325
Reminder, underage drinking
is illegal and not fun.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.870

07:52.889 --> 07:56.100
but then you didn't,
and I couldn't cancel them.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.393
Did anyone else see them?

07:57.393 --> 07:59.687
Have I outed you?
Am I bad ally?

07:59.687 --> 08:01.439
No, you're fine.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.982
I'm just disturbed
that you think I am

08:02.982 --> 08:05.359
the kind of gay person
who would like that.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.403
Got it. When you come out
to Whitney and Bela,

08:07.403 --> 08:09.030
I'll get you a classier
balloon tower.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.574
My ideal coming-out
does not involve balloons.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.242
No balloons at all, please.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.869
Are you gonna tell
Bela and Whitney?

08:14.869 --> 08:18.789
At some point, probably,
but not right now.

08:18.789 --> 08:21.083
Well, I'm here for you.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.711
Okay, I gotta go
to the financial aid office

08:23.711 --> 08:24.921
to ask for a loan.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.172
Wish me luck.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.257
Wait,
wearing your Sips uniform?

08:28.257 --> 08:30.092
Yeah, I want them
to know I have a job.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.510
It's pretty smart, right?

08:31.510 --> 08:33.846
Kimberly, banks only
give money to people

08:33.846 --> 08:37.099
who look like
they already have money.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.142
Let me help you.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.195
- Kimberly Finkle?
- Here.

08:52.281 --> 08:54.033
I'm so psyched
for the off-season.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.660
I got hit with a soccer ball
so many times,

08:55.660 --> 08:57.620
I think my titties got CTE.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.830
So what are we gonna do
with all our free time?

08:59.830 --> 09:01.165
I'm thinking sleeping till 3:00

09:01.165 --> 09:02.708
and then drinking
till the other 3:00.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.585
Mm, that's a no for me.
My schedule's packed.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.254
Already?
How?

09:06.254 --> 09:07.713
Off-season is when
we do all the stuff

09:07.713 --> 09:09.131
we can't do during soccer.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.716
I'm running
for student government.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.802
Have you seen those losers?
I'm gon' clean up.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.387
Why would you wanna do that?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.347
Pad that grad school résumé, babe.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.724
Yeah, I've got basketball.
I'm a two-season athlete.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.601
But you were just joking
about sleeping

09:20.601 --> 09:22.311
and drinking all day, right?

09:22.311 --> 09:25.314
Yes, duh, totally.

09:25.314 --> 09:28.025
I've got so much going on.
Let's go.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.033
Well, Ms. Finkle,

09:36.033 --> 09:37.743
I think we're gonna be able
to get you this loan.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.162
Oh, my God, really?
That's such a relief.

09:40.162 --> 09:42.999
I'm happy to help.
Do you, uh, have any questions?

09:42.999 --> 09:44.417
- No.
- Actually, yes.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.961
When does the loan start
accruing interest,

09:46.961 --> 09:48.754
and is it fixed or variable?

09:48.754 --> 09:50.172
Great questions.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.717
Let me just get you
this pamphlet.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.968
Oh, wow.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.845
Everyone in here
looks so happy.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.221
Kimberly,
they're print models.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.015
I've seen that girl
in a NuvaRing ad.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.600
Can you at least walk us
through the payback structure?

10:01.600 --> 10:04.603
Uh, well,
with a loan your size,

10:04.603 --> 10:08.357
you'd be paying about $900
a month for the next 30 years.

10:08.357 --> 10:11.110
But with autopay,
it's like you don't even know

10:11.110 --> 10:12.862
the money's leaving
your account.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.989
You're gonna be paying this
back until you're, like, 50.

10:14.989 --> 10:18.951
Oh, the payoff age is
actually late-60s on average.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.620
Oh.
I don't have any other options.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.414
I'd like to go ahead
with the loan.

10:23.414 --> 10:26.167
Wonderful,
let's get you that shmoney.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.668
I'm just gonna go grab
the paperwork

10:27.668 --> 10:29.211
for your parents to cosign.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.713
No!

10:30.713 --> 10:33.966
I mean, what if
that's not an option?

10:33.966 --> 10:38.804
I'm sorry, but a cosigner
is kind of a non-negotiable.

10:38.804 --> 10:42.516
Oh, then I don't think
I can do this.

10:42.516 --> 10:43.976
Thanks for your time.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.898
Welcome,
funny ladies of Essex.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.067
We're so happy
you're interested in joining

10:51.067 --> 10:55.946
our school's first ever,
female-only comedy magazine.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.741
I know what you're thinking.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.452
Will it be hard to do this
without a bunch of guys

11:01.452 --> 11:04.288
who steal all their ideas
from Conan and "SNL"?

11:04.288 --> 11:05.831
No, it will not.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.124
If you're in this room,

11:07.124 --> 11:08.751
it means you're part
of the movement--

11:08.751 --> 11:10.795
except for that guy,
who's doing homework, I think.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.255
We're still working on finding
a permanent meeting space.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.966
We're so excited
to read your submissions.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.927
Mm-hmm.
In a few short days,

11:17.927 --> 11:19.804
some of you lucky ladies
will be joining us

11:19.804 --> 11:21.889
in writing our groundbreaking
first edition

11:21.889 --> 11:24.433
as one of our newfound
comedy sisters.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.522
Holy shit,
these girls are unfunny turds.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.357
In a good way?

11:31.357 --> 11:32.983
How would that be
in a good way?

11:32.983 --> 11:34.652
Bela, you're overreacting.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.697
Some are... fine.
- Have you read these?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.615
This girl wrote a poem
about celiac disease,

11:39.615 --> 11:42.952
and this girl wrote
a phrase called "OBGY-LOL."

11:42.952 --> 11:45.871
What does that even mean?
- So they have a lot to learn.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.165
We'll teach them.
- I really need this to work.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.917
I wanna write with writers
that are funny,

11:49.917 --> 11:51.335
like you and Jo.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.212
- And me.
- Sure.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.964
Look, none of us thought
we were gonna find

11:54.964 --> 11:57.591
a bunch of amazing and
hilarious people right away.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.885
Just be patient, okay?

11:59.885 --> 12:01.053
Okay.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.806
<i>♪ Never gonna be the same ♪</i>

12:03.806 --> 12:05.474
Sorry about your loan, Kimberly.

12:05.474 --> 12:06.809
If it makes you feel
any better,

12:06.809 --> 12:08.644
my new comedy magazine's
a disaster.

12:08.644 --> 12:09.854
Really?
Why?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.313
Because they all stink.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.982
I'm worried "The Catullan"
was onto something

12:12.982 --> 12:14.984
not letting women
join until 1994.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.610
- Mmm.
- Look, I don't know anything

12:16.610 --> 12:18.028
about comedy...
- So true.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.363
So, so true.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.115
But maybe, before
you throw this all away,

12:21.115 --> 12:22.741
you should talk to someone
who's done it before.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.160
That does seem
like good advice.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.661
Ooh, well,
I have some cool news.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.121
I'm gonna be
on the water polo team.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.372
- Really?
- What?

12:28.372 --> 12:29.999
I didn't know you played
water polo.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.042
Oh, I don't--yet.
But it seems easy.

12:32.042 --> 12:33.502
Based off a video I watched,

12:33.502 --> 12:34.879
I think it's just pool soccer
with hands.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.130
And then we can hang out

12:36.130 --> 12:37.506
with the water polo guys.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.550
You know,
maybe things are looking up.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.260
Ow, my boob!

12:42.428 --> 12:43.679
What the fuck?

12:43.679 --> 12:45.681
Sorry.
Not really, though.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.490
Did you guys hear that?

13:03.574 --> 13:05.701
Oh, my God.

13:05.701 --> 13:06.994

13:06.994 --> 13:08.245
Wait,
that's the climate refugee.

13:08.245 --> 13:09.455
That's his room.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.208
Wonder who she is.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.126
Well, whoever she is, she's
having the time of her life.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.128
They are being so loud.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.838
It's literal noise pollution.
I'm gonna knock.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.215
- Don't you dare!
- Oh, ow, ow.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.466
Just let me record
a little first.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.185
Bela?
It's 8:15 in the morning.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.604
Why are you here?
- It's urgent.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.397
How did you find
my apartment?

13:35.397 --> 13:37.900
It was a very conscious choice
to not tell you where it was.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.735
Look, my new magazine
is a disaster.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.904
All the applicants suck,
which is why I've decided

13:41.904 --> 13:43.697
to immediately give up
and accept my old spot

13:43.697 --> 13:45.366
on "The Catullan."
Bela's back.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.575
You're welcome.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.869
Um, no.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.871
I don't think anyone's gonna
be excited to work with a girl

13:50.871 --> 13:52.748
who left and stole all
of our good writers.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.875
They left willingly.
"The Catullan" sucked.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.460
You just said you wanted
to come back to it.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.879
Fine then.
Will you join my magazine?

13:58.879 --> 14:02.007
What can I say that will
help you leave my apartment?

14:02.007 --> 14:04.593
What do I do?

14:04.593 --> 14:07.137
Um, okay,

14:07.137 --> 14:09.306
so you're building
a team, right?

14:09.306 --> 14:11.892
So you gotta look at this
as your LeBron moment.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.812
This is your chance to put
together a super comedy lineup.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.355
Right?
Like, LeBron didn't just wait

14:16.355 --> 14:17.731
for people
to come join the team.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.899
He went out, and he found

14:18.899 --> 14:19.984
Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.944
Uh-huh, got it.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.779
Can you put that
in not sports terms?

14:23.779 --> 14:26.282
Just find a bunch
of funny people.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.616
Cool.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.165
Good morning, ladies.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.959
Welcome to water polo tryouts.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.545
We're gonna do a scrimmage so
I can assess your skill level.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.921
This seems fun.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.464
You ever played
water polo before?

14:42.464 --> 14:44.800
Yup, I played competitively
for eight years.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.011
Yeah, I just started,
but I'm pretty sure

14:47.011 --> 14:48.554
it's gonna be my life now too.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.639
Ooh, also, real quick,
what are the rules?

14:50.639 --> 14:52.141
Up, up, up, up! Let's go!

14:52.141 --> 14:53.475
Come on, ladies!
Get in the water!

14:53.475 --> 14:54.685
Here we go, yes!

14:55.853 --> 14:58.355
All right, let's go. Pass it!

14:58.355 --> 15:01.442
How are you guys not using
your arms to swim right now?

15:01.442 --> 15:03.027
Come on, you got this!

15:03.027 --> 15:05.404
- Whoo!
- Which team am I on again?

15:05.404 --> 15:06.697
Let's go!
Quickly!

15:07.906 --> 15:08.991
Me, I got it!
I'm open--

15:10.159 --> 15:11.910
Mm.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.120
Transition! High!

15:14.788 --> 15:16.415
- Oy.
- I'm open! I'm ope--

15:21.086 --> 15:24.840
You got knocked out,
but I gave you mouth-to-mouth.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.800
Thanks.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.594
I think I get the rules now.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.179
Should I jump back in?

15:30.179 --> 15:31.180
No.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.106
- So how'd it go with the loan?
- Honestly, not great.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.442
They said they need my parents
to cosign my loan,

15:43.442 --> 15:45.319
and I can't tell them
what happened.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.237
- So what are you gonna do?
- Ooh, I have an idea.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.823
My cousin got a bunch of money
when she was hit by a city bus.

15:49.823 --> 15:51.742
Do that.
- Actually, I found

15:51.742 --> 15:55.037
a super high-paying second job
I can do from my dorm room.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.872
I'm typing up
the closed captioning

15:56.872 --> 16:00.376
for a reality show called
"Sex Paradise: Australia."

16:00.376 --> 16:02.461
- That's a job?
- It sure is.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.088
All I have to do
is watch an episode,

16:04.088 --> 16:06.715
listen very closely, and
type up what they're saying--

16:06.715 --> 16:08.425
and the noises they make
in the Pleasure Hut--

16:08.425 --> 16:12.012
for 20 freakin' bucks an hour.
- That's disgusting.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.681
How many episodes
are they paying you for?

16:13.681 --> 16:15.349
It's 300 episodes a season.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.017
So if I can
find time to transcribe

16:17.017 --> 16:19.895
for at least 50 hours a week,
on top of my school work

16:19.895 --> 16:23.065
and my Sips job, my finances
will be totally taken care of.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.483
That's too much.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.026
You should just tell
your mom what happened

16:26.026 --> 16:27.277
and have her cosign a loan.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.071
No, I'm gonna go
with my thing.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.280
Okay.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.701
<i>I don't have
any other interests.</i>

16:33.701 --> 16:38.038
Okay, what would you say
is my thing, besides soccer?

16:38.038 --> 16:39.998
That you're cool.

16:39.998 --> 16:42.751
- Mm-hmm.
- And you're pretty.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.295
And you can kind of sing
karaoke, but not really.

16:45.295 --> 16:46.755
Seriously, Canaan.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.507
I don't get what's going on.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.385
I guess I'm feeling... lost.

16:51.385 --> 16:55.556
Okay, well, what do you wanna
do with your life?

16:55.556 --> 16:58.142
I don't know.
What about you?

16:58.142 --> 17:00.436
Well, I actually have
a very detailed ten-year plan

17:00.436 --> 17:02.813
that will hopefully lead me
into starting my own hedge fund

17:02.813 --> 17:04.606
that focuses
on impact investing.

17:04.606 --> 17:05.816
So I'll basically
be helping people

17:05.816 --> 17:07.192
while getting very, very rich.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.736
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.779
I feel like I'm the only
person in college

17:10.779 --> 17:13.866
who doesn't have their whole
life already figured out.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.784
It kind of sucks.

17:15.784 --> 17:19.121
Well, I know
you're gonna figure it out,

17:19.121 --> 17:22.332
because you're smart, and
whatever you put your mind to,

17:22.332 --> 17:24.334
you're gonna kill it.

17:24.334 --> 17:27.129
- Thank you.
- Unless it's water polo.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.882
I knew you were
gonna do that.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.137
<i>Oh, my God, you guys.</i>

17:35.137 --> 17:37.681
Okay, there is
so much snow already.

17:37.681 --> 17:39.016
Are we sure this is safe?

17:39.016 --> 17:41.268
Like, do people get
boob frostbite?

17:41.268 --> 17:44.146
I don't think so, but it's
definitely worth a Google.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.149
Okay, so the snow run ends
at Frat Row,

17:47.149 --> 17:49.026
where all the frats will be
hosting big parties,

17:49.026 --> 17:50.402
and since Theta's out,

17:50.402 --> 17:52.279
I did some comprehensive
Instagram stalking

17:52.279 --> 17:54.156
to figure out
the next best option,

17:54.156 --> 17:56.200
and it is definitely Omega Pi.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.618
Their guys are
for sure the hottest

17:57.618 --> 17:58.994
if anyone wants to check.
- Is that why

17:58.994 --> 18:00.621
my printer is out of ink?
- It's 2022.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.331
Why do you even have a printer?
This is on you.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.333
As I was saying,
Omega Pi's hosting

18:04.333 --> 18:05.959
a huge Winter Underland party.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.795
It is gonna be lit,
and we're all going.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.923
Not me. I have to stay home
and do some closed captioning.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.841
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

18:12.841 --> 18:15.177
I think this is gonna be
my new normal for a while.

18:15.177 --> 18:18.013
All right.
We gotta go, ladies.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.598
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.
Can I just say

18:19.598 --> 18:21.475
that all three of us look
so fucking hot right now

18:21.475 --> 18:23.852
and that this is gonna be one
of the best days of our lives!

18:25.103 --> 18:26.688
Ah!
- Oh, my God!

18:26.688 --> 18:29.441
Aah!
- Ah, my--ow, ow!

18:29.441 --> 18:30.984
Ah!
- Bela, Bela, stop, stop.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.111
- Get up! Get up!
- Ow, ow, ow.

18:33.111 --> 18:34.530
Jessica has just made

18:34.530 --> 18:36.448
<i>the bloody agonizing decision</i>

18:36.448 --> 18:37.950
<i>to dump Braxton,</i>

18:37.950 --> 18:40.702
<i>and now she deals
with the consequences.</i>

18:40.702 --> 18:42.621
<i>You know,
it's, like, a game, right?</i>

18:42.621 --> 18:45.040
<i>But it's also, like,
finding love, you know?</i>

18:45.040 --> 18:47.417
What the fuck is she saying?

18:47.417 --> 18:49.044
<i>To dump Braxton,</i>

18:49.044 --> 18:52.005
<i>and now she deals
with the consequences.</i>

18:52.005 --> 18:53.715
<i>You know,
it's, like, a game, right?</i>

18:53.715 --> 18:55.759
<i>But it's also, like,
finding love, you know?</i>

19:12.568 --> 19:13.735
God damn it.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.404
Can you please keep it down?

19:18.907 --> 19:20.242
Shut up!

19:20.242 --> 19:21.577
Assholes!

19:28.250 --> 19:30.878
Everyone, drink up!
We run in two minutes!

19:33.422 --> 19:35.299
My eyeballs are cold.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.341
- Yeah.
- Uh, same.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.509
- Hey!
- Oh!

19:37.509 --> 19:38.760
- You're here!
- Kimberly!

19:38.760 --> 19:40.095
What--I thought
you had to work.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.763
I don't think
I can do that job.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.057
Drunk Australian people
are so hard to understand,

19:44.057 --> 19:46.268
especially with our neighbor
having sex so loud.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.312
Well, you don't have to fix
all your problems tonight,

19:48.312 --> 19:50.564
but there is one thing
you do have to do.

19:50.564 --> 19:51.940
Exactly.
Take off that coat.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.525
Let me see
those granny panties.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.568
- Ah!
- Ah.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.278
- Oh!
- God damn,

19:56.278 --> 19:59.114
underneath all those unstylish
clothes, you're, like, hot.

19:59.114 --> 20:00.449
Oh, hell yeah,

20:00.449 --> 20:02.868
congrats
on the underwear glow-up, girl.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.494
Everybody ready to run?

20:05.954 --> 20:07.873
Three, two, one,

20:07.873 --> 20:09.791
strip and go!

Ow!

20:29.686 --> 20:31.146
- Hey.
- Yeah.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.732
Fuck Theta.
Omega Pi is where it's at.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.951
I have never seen
this many hot,

20:43.951 --> 20:45.702
shirtless men in one place.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.663
I know.
I'm taking screenshots

20:47.663 --> 20:49.373
but with my brain for later.

20:49.373 --> 20:52.167
Same, except I also took
a couple pictures on my phone.

20:52.167 --> 20:54.252
Oh, see that pack
of cis daddies right there?

20:54.252 --> 20:56.129
I can see every single
one of their dick shapes.

20:56.129 --> 20:58.507
Homie on the right got
a big ol' toddler arm

20:58.507 --> 21:00.050
in his boxer briefs.

21:01.176 --> 21:02.678
- Lila?
- Hmm?

21:02.678 --> 21:04.179
Would you ever be interested
in writing a listicle

21:04.179 --> 21:05.847
about dick shapes
for my comedy magazine?

21:05.847 --> 21:07.224
Well, I don't know
what the fuck a listicle is,

21:07.224 --> 21:09.017
but hell yes, bitch,
let's do it.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.156
Hey, I'm Sara.

21:23.156 --> 21:25.033
Hey, I'm Kimberly.
This is Leighton.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.202
Cool.
You wanna dance?

21:27.202 --> 21:29.746
Um, I'm actually just dancing
with my friend right now.

21:29.746 --> 21:31.123
Okay.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.791
I was actually gonna go
to the bathroom,

21:32.791 --> 21:34.793
so I'm gonna go do that.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.964
So, uh, you want a shot?

21:38.964 --> 21:41.800
From the smell of it, I'd say
it's shockingly bad tequila.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.011
Mm, horrible.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.137
Yeah, I'm down.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.305
No, let me do it for you.

21:47.305 --> 21:49.599
Open your mouth.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.187
Um, actually, I'm good.
I'm good.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.273
Um, sorry,
but I only drink top shelf.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.899
All right.

21:57.899 --> 22:00.402
Thanks.

- No, you're good.

22:08.243 --> 22:11.496
I'm trying to make on-purpose
nip slips my signature move.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.081
Ooh.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.500
Oh, that fucking
climate refugee is here.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.420
Holy shit.
Look at him holding that beer.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.671
Dude has Marvel arms.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.256
Yeah.
Yeah, now I kind of get

22:21.256 --> 22:23.383
why that girl was
being so loud.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.888
- Hi. It's Jackson, right?
- Yeah.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.182
Well, I'm Kimberly.
My room is right next to yours.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.100
- Cool.
- It's actually not cool,

22:32.100 --> 22:34.227
because you've been
at Essex for, like, three days,

22:34.227 --> 22:35.854
and you're already having
the loudest,

22:35.854 --> 22:37.898
most performative sex
in the world.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.108
For your information, some
of the people at this school

22:40.108 --> 22:41.818
have some really
important work to do,

22:41.818 --> 22:43.445
and that's hard when you're,

22:43.445 --> 22:45.113
you know, grunting
your head off going like--

22:46.406 --> 22:47.449
On the other side of some very,

22:47.449 --> 22:49.201
very, thin drywall, okay?

22:49.201 --> 22:50.786
- You done?
- Yeah, I think so.

22:50.786 --> 22:53.580
Well, just so you know,
it actually kind of sucks

22:53.580 --> 22:55.290
sharing a wall with you too.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.042
What the hell ass TV show

22:57.042 --> 22:59.127
have you been watching
so loudly?

22:59.127 --> 23:01.296
It's called
"Sex Paradise: Australia."

23:01.296 --> 23:02.839
I didn't know
you could hear it.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.217
Oh, I can.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.135
Let me see your phone.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.888
I've already hit
my data cap for the month,

23:09.888 --> 23:11.473
so don't go on YouTube.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.974
Here.
Now you have my number.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.726
Just shoot me a text

23:14.726 --> 23:16.520
if anything on my side
of the wall gets too loud.

23:18.855 --> 23:22.651
- Yeah!
- Ah, yes, bitch!

23:30.575 --> 23:32.160
I don't know, man.

23:32.160 --> 23:35.580
Thing is, she really doesn't
have anything besides soccer,

23:35.580 --> 23:37.749
so I didn't really know
what to say, you know?

23:37.749 --> 23:40.293
Boom! Let's go.
That's mine.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.670
That's all me.
Run it back, run it back.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.514
Hey. You good?

23:52.514 --> 23:54.933
Yeah. Course I am.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.226
both: Ooh!

23:56.226 --> 23:58.854
Ah.
I just threw up in a trophy.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.522
Who wants another shot?

24:00.522 --> 24:02.566
Hey, whoa, whoa, you are
way too wasted to be here.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.025
I think I gotta take you home.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.360
No, no, no--

24:05.360 --> 24:06.736
- I'm gonna text you later.
- Uh-huh.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.113
Say goodbye, champ.
It's time to go.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.197
Time to go.
- Ugh, it tastes like

24:09.197 --> 24:10.699
someone puked in my mouth!

24:10.699 --> 24:12.409
Did you guys
have fun tonight?

24:12.409 --> 24:14.786
Yeah, we did!
Thanks for asking!

24:14.786 --> 24:16.246
Great,

24:16.246 --> 24:18.456
because it'll be the last
party you'll ever go to.

24:18.456 --> 24:20.500
- Dude, what is your problem?
- Seriously.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.669
Who died and made you
king of all the frats?

24:22.669 --> 24:23.920
You're a Theta.

24:25.589 --> 24:26.965
These are the girls
I was telling you about,

24:26.965 --> 24:28.300
the ones who narced on us.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.718
You're a liability, bro.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.220
A liability?
More like like-ability.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.889
We're a damn pleasure
to have around.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.223
Isn't that right?
both: Mm-hmm.

24:35.223 --> 24:37.058
Y'all need
to get the fuck out.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.896
- Oh, my God.
- We're gonna die.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.814
- I'm getting nipple frostbite.
- Fuck.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.238
Barring the fact that we got
banned from frats last night,

24:50.238 --> 24:51.865
I still think we had
a really fun time.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.242
Kimberly got
climate refugee's phone number.

24:54.242 --> 24:55.911
For emergencies.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.705
What about you, Leighton,
did you chat up any hotties?

24:59.915 --> 25:02.167
Fine. You're too classy
to kiss and tell.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.376
I get it.

25:09.090 --> 25:11.551
Uh, actually,
there is something

25:11.551 --> 25:13.803
that I've been meaning
to tell you guys.

25:17.390 --> 25:18.934
I'm gay.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.520
Wow, Leighton,
that's awesome.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.356
Should we hug?
I feel like we should hug.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.149
Uh, no, we don't--
we don't need to hug.

25:26.149 --> 25:29.277
Oh, Leighton, that's so cool.
And I-I'm so shocked.

25:29.277 --> 25:30.737
I mean, I had no idea.
I guess it's like

25:30.737 --> 25:32.239
my gaydar is way off
or something.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.740
Kimberly already knew,
didn't she?

25:33.740 --> 25:34.658
Uh-huh.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.826
Mm.

25:36.826 --> 25:39.496
She's been a really good
friend about it, though.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.457
She even tried to get me alone

25:42.457 --> 25:44.000
with a girl at the party
last night.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.419
Oh, my God, the girl
I saw you talking to.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.462
She was so hot.

25:47.462 --> 25:49.005
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

25:50.423 --> 25:54.010
Yeah, but then--then I, like,
freaked out and got weird,

25:54.010 --> 25:56.137
and she's probably not
interested anymore, so--

25:56.137 --> 25:58.556
No way.
If you DM'd her right now,

25:58.556 --> 26:00.976
I promise you
it would be back on.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.227
Slide into her DM.

26:02.227 --> 26:03.645
- Yeah, message her.
- Now, do it.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.814
both:
Slide in, slide in.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.524
All right, fine.
Fine, I'll do it.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.119
I said, "Hi."

26:21.830 --> 26:23.415
Yes!

How are you in here?

26:31.214 --> 26:32.799
I literally had them change
the buzzer code.

26:32.799 --> 26:34.634
I waited for someone to exit.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.679
I just wanted
to say thank you

26:37.679 --> 26:39.180
for your advice.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.557
I found another
super funny writer

26:40.557 --> 26:41.850
who I think is gonna be great,

26:41.850 --> 26:44.019
so it really helped.

26:45.103 --> 26:48.481
You came here at 7:45
just for that?

26:48.481 --> 26:50.025
Yeah, just that.
