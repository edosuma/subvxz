01:55.640 --> 01:58.712
Does this look like pink to you?

01:58.960 --> 02:01.030
I said pink!

02:01.280 --> 02:03.748
Pink, you bone top!

02:08.600 --> 02:12.149
A thousand pardons,
my little carbuncle.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.476
With this attitude, you're gonna be
working here for the rest of your life.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.756
Take a gander
into the seat next to you...

02:22.000 --> 02:24.389
...if you wanna see
what your future looks like.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.159
Come, Penelope.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.631
Let's go someplace
where they treat us with respect!

02:35.880 --> 02:39.077
Try the moon,
you'll weigh less there.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.715
What the hell happened
to my lunchbox?

02:55.760 --> 02:57.318
Mr. Bundy?

02:57.840 --> 02:59.990
I'm Dexter, the temp you ordered.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.793
Well, that can't be.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.072
No, I wanted someone
with a 44-inch chest.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.912
- D cup?
- Yeah.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.798
That's me.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.958
Have you ever sold shoes before?

03:12.200 --> 03:13.792
Nope.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.754
You?

03:17.880 --> 03:19.313
Nope.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.996
Welcome aboard. Grab a seat.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.998
Sorry I'm late, but there's a
line around the block out there.

03:25.240 --> 03:29.597
Those are for tickets for a rock group
called Burned Beyond Recognition.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.957
What kind of moron would wait in line
all day for a rock group?

03:36.400 --> 03:39.437
I gotta get back in line, Dad.
Thanks for the bathroom.

03:39.680 --> 03:44.629
Son, you and Kelly have been
waiting in line for three days.

03:44.880 --> 03:48.236
Dad, Burned Beyond Recognition
is the coolest band in the world.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.040
Burned Beyond Recognition.

03:51.280 --> 03:54.750
Why can't these rock groups have
cool names, like when we were kids?

03:55.000 --> 03:58.754
Groups like 1910 Fruitgum Company.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.995
Yeah, that was back in the '60s,
wasn't it?

04:02.240 --> 04:03.798
We learned about that in history.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.158
Yeah, you laugh.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.756
But at least we could have sex
without being wrapped in a tire.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.832
I'm sorry to bring up
that sex thing, son.

04:20.079 --> 04:21.718
What's so special about this band?

04:22.280 --> 04:26.114
Oh, the lead singer's been known to
vomit and urinate on the audience.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.749
Pee-per-view.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.273
Yeah, and if you smile up at Dung,
the lead guitarist...

04:32.520 --> 04:34.909
...he'll headbutt you
right in your teeth.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.829
There's nothing like
someone taking a running start...

04:38.040 --> 04:40.429
...and diving onto you, face first.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.398
Actually, there is.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.915
Wife calls it courting.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.237
Hey, no cutting ahead.
I've been here for three days.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.913
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.072
Say, you are one beautiful girl.

05:08.320 --> 05:11.278
Right. And the check is in my mouth.

05:12.840 --> 05:16.150
I know the guys backstage
would love to meet you.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.913
You have backstage passes?

05:18.160 --> 05:19.752
You have to get me back there.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.788
No problem. Just trade places in line
with me, and they're yours.

05:24.040 --> 05:27.271
Well, okay.

05:27.480 --> 05:30.313
Boy, Bud's gonna be so proud of me.
Where's your place in line?

05:30.560 --> 05:33.836
You know where the end of the line is?
Past that.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.349
Hello, losers.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.637
Me and my sister
are way, way, way...

05:48.880 --> 05:51.519
What the hell
are you doing back here?

05:51.960 --> 05:53.552
I got us backstage passes.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.155
All I had to do
was trade places with some guy.

05:57.520 --> 06:00.159
Kelly, these are bus transfers.

06:01.840 --> 06:06.709
Hey, not only can we get backstage,
we have a way to the concert.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.796
You can't be this dumb.

06:12.120 --> 06:15.192
I can be anything I wanna be.
It's the '90s.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.518
Never mind.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.393
I wish Mom would hurry up
with the food. I'm starving.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.670
But there's no way
I'm leaving this line again.

06:24.920 --> 06:29.152
She's probably pulling into the parking
lot right now. You can depend on Mom.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.072
Peggy. Peggy. Peggy!

06:45.880 --> 06:47.791
Quick! Turn on the radio.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.635
It's the Rick Dees show.
He is in rare form today.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.269
- What's he doing?
- Performing a public service.

06:54.520 --> 06:57.876
Humiliating and destroying men
on the air.

06:59.320 --> 07:03.108
Hi, I'm Rick Dees
and welcome to Berate Your Mate.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.117
Today, ladies,
we're gonna have fun by...

07:05.320 --> 07:08.995
...making your husbands sing
the world's most insipid love song.

07:09.240 --> 07:13.756
- Of course, that insipid love song is.
- "Wind Beneath My Wings"?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.912
"Wind Beneath My Wings."

07:17.920 --> 07:21.833
Too bad it's not "Wind Beneath
My Pants." Al would be a shoo-in.

07:23.120 --> 07:26.157
Now, if you can get your husband
to sing "Wind Beneath My Wings"...

07:26.400 --> 07:29.119
...on the air,
without telling him it's a contest...

07:29.320 --> 07:31.470
What kind of woman
would do that to her husband?

07:31.720 --> 07:36.510
- you'll win a $ 200 gift certificate
to Victoria's Secret.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.833
- Yep?
- AI, it's me.

07:41.080 --> 07:45.517
- You know what I'd lik e right now?
- A chocolate couch?

07:48.040 --> 07:52.318
Well, yeah, but right now,
I want you to sing to me.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.993
Come on, Peg, I'm working here.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.080
- Hook it! Hook it!
- Hold it.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.152
Hold it. Hold it.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.670
But, Al, I'm feeling a little lonely...

08:01.920 --> 08:04.832
...and nothing would cheer me up more
than hearing you sing:

08:05.080 --> 08:07.071
"Wind Beneath My Wings."

08:07.320 --> 08:08.673
Just a second here, Peg!

08:08.920 --> 08:12.037
God! Get this thing on there.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.759
Dexter, get the tranquilizer gun.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.599
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to tag and release this one.

08:20.840 --> 08:25.470
Come on, Al. I really wanna hear
"Wind Beneath My Wings."

08:25.880 --> 08:28.474
Well, then jump off the roof, Peg.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.874
Oh, you're hurting my baby toe!

08:36.360 --> 08:41.388
Ma'am, there ain't a damn thing
on your body that's baby.

08:50.040 --> 08:53.635
- What's keeping Mom?
- Why don't you go look for her?

08:54.080 --> 08:56.674
Leave you here,
so I can come back and hear you say:

08:56.880 --> 09:00.350
"Bud, I traded our place in line
for these magic beans."

09:06.360 --> 09:09.750
No, you go look for her. I'm gonna
stay here and guard our place.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.393
Fine.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.389
Backstage passes.
She'd fall for anything.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.315
Hi, there, cutie. Can I cut in line?

09:24.600 --> 09:26.397
Absolutely.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.950
Would you mind if
a few of my friends joined us?

09:30.760 --> 09:32.239
Are they as good-looking as you?

09:34.120 --> 09:35.439
I think so.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.191
Let the games begin.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.437
He said okay.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.919
Please, Al.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.991
Yeah, I know you, Peg.

09:58.240 --> 10:02.153
If I start singing, you'll get as horny
as the cape of the same name.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.588
Well, sing to me.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.635
Oh, all right.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.596
Help!

10:19.000 --> 10:22.913
She's fallen and I can't get up.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.711
- Gotta go, Peg.
- Sing first.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.598
Gotta go, Peg!

10:31.520 --> 10:33.431
Dexter! Are you all right?

10:33.680 --> 10:36.069
I think I'm done for.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.831
Just shoot me.

10:39.520 --> 10:42.114
And tell Laura I love her.

10:42.520 --> 10:47.469
I'll get help. Just to try to find
an air pocket in there someplace!

10:48.640 --> 10:50.790
Now, now, Mrs. Bundy,
don't give up on him.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.951
I'm gonna give you
a second chance to win.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.193
How'd you lik e dinner for two
at the best restaurant in town?

10:57.560 --> 11:00.233
Ed's Tacos and Liquor?

11:01.000 --> 11:05.790
No. We're gonna send you to a place
with a roof and tables. Umbertos.

11:06.280 --> 11:07.793
- Umbertos?
- Oh, it's great.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.356
Okay, Rick. What do I have to do?

11:14.960 --> 11:17.030
What is it now, Peg?

11:17.400 --> 11:21.109
Al, this is very, very important.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.430
You know my boobs?

11:25.160 --> 11:28.596
Yeah, they're standing in line
for concert tickets.

11:35.240 --> 11:38.676
Not those boobs. My chest.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.229
I need you to say over the phone...

11:41.480 --> 11:44.233
...that cute little nickname
that you have for them.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.548
What is it, Peg?

11:48.760 --> 11:51.911
Your One Week to a Dead Husband
kit come in?

11:52.560 --> 11:54.790
I'm trying to work here!

11:55.040 --> 11:56.439
Clear!

12:00.040 --> 12:01.359
Oh, come on, Al.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.068
You know what you call them.
Just say it.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.595
Peg, do you think Mrs. lacocca
calls Lee and says:

12:06.840 --> 12:08.910
"Lee, before you go back
into the boardroom...

12:09.160 --> 12:12.516
...what's that cute little nickname
you have for my ass?"

12:15.520 --> 12:18.830
Now, look, Al, you just don't
understand. This is extreme...

12:19.080 --> 12:20.638
Clear!

12:24.880 --> 12:27.030
Hang in there, Dexter.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.950
Mrs. Bundy,
we're gonna give you one last chance.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.557
You'll win a trip to Tahiti
and $10, 000 in cash...

12:34.800 --> 12:37.712
...if you can get your husband
to come home.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.793
- I can do that.
- I mean, in the next 60 minutes.

12:41.040 --> 12:44.350
- I can do that.
- For a nooner.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.953
Do you have any consolation prizes?

13:00.840 --> 13:02.193
Do you have anything sexy?

13:07.600 --> 13:09.431
No, do you?

13:17.840 --> 13:20.115
It's a good job.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.839
Hello.

13:26.440 --> 13:27.953
It's for you.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.709
Guess who this is.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.709
My brain on drugs?

13:37.560 --> 13:39.391
Al, it's me.

13:39.640 --> 13:43.519
I want you to come home
for a nooner.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.232
A nooner?

13:48.720 --> 13:49.948
Yeah.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.953
- Well, sure. What time?
- Now!

13:53.160 --> 13:54.149
I'll be right there!

13:55.440 --> 13:56.668
Dexter, mind the store.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.353
But I can't work the register.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.512
Well, do what I do. Pocket it.

14:05.600 --> 14:08.273
I'm getting me some nooner!

14:13.840 --> 14:16.593
- Nooner?
- Yeah. Yeah, you know, like lunch.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.990
You want me to bring you
back some?

14:21.560 --> 14:26.111
Al, nooner is when you have sex
in the middle of the day.

14:31.320 --> 14:34.630
You just agreed
to make love to your wife.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.392
Great jumping horny toads!

14:41.840 --> 14:44.593
- I did it. I did it.
- Not yet, Mrs. Bundy.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.273
We gotta k eep you on the line...

14:46.480 --> 14:49.392
...and see if your husband
really does come home before 1.00.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.073
Oh, he'll be here.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.278
And by the way,
could you define "sex"?

14:54.520 --> 14:58.593
I mean, it doesn't have to last long
or feel good or anything, right?

14:58.840 --> 15:04.312
No, Mrs. Bundy, just as in football,
all he has to do is break the plane.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.711
Oh, Marcie, I'm so excited.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.758
I'm gonna have sex and go to Tahiti.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.188
Al's never been there.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.476
I bet he's never been to Tahiti either.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.039
Kelly.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.675
Back here.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.036
Let me guess.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.356
A girl, right?

15:39.840 --> 15:41.478
Look, look.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.553
Sometimes a person's just so sexy
that you fall in love...

15:44.760 --> 15:47.320
...and if they want
to cut ahead of you, then so be it.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.272
Great. Now I owe Dad 10 bucks.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.279
Shut up, okay?

15:59.480 --> 16:02.677
If we can manage to stay right here,
we're still gonna get our tickets.

16:02.880 --> 16:06.429
The box office for Burned Beyond
Recognition is now open.

16:06.680 --> 16:09.797
Remember, no line-cutting allowed.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.871
Hey, wait a minute!

16:22.040 --> 16:23.678
I'm starving.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.514
It's obvious Mom's not gonna
bring us any food.

16:26.760 --> 16:30.514
And I can't leave you here. You'd give
away our place to anything in a skirt.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.833
Well, I'm not leaving you here.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.793
You'd give your skirt away
to anyone in the place.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.550
Who are we gonna get
to stand in line for us?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.355
Hey, Dad, you're not doing anything.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.234
I'm selling shoes.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.914
Yeah, and we're writing
a screenplay.

16:56.120 --> 16:57.758
What's it about?

17:02.200 --> 17:03.872
Come on, Dad. Please?

17:04.119 --> 17:05.598
Oh, all right.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.717
I'm not really selling shoes.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.478
- Thanks. Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

17:09.720 --> 17:13.348
- Hey, you want anything?
- Yeah, I'd like an egg sal...

17:14.480 --> 17:17.790
Hey, are they selling
Wayne Newton tickets too?

17:18.599 --> 17:22.638
Well, at least Wayne never had to pee
on his audience to gain their respect.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.318
I don't know, maybe he did.
I can't explain his popularity.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.390
Al? Al, what are you doing here?

17:31.640 --> 17:33.437
Paying the price for having kids.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.358
No, you should be home
having sex with your wife.

17:39.080 --> 17:42.675
- Why?
- Because I heard Peggy on the radio.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.150
If you get home before 1:00
for a nooner...

17:45.360 --> 17:50.150
...you win $10,000
and a trip to Tahiti.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.795
$10,000 and a trip to Tahiti,
just for sex with Peg?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.228
Yeah.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.232
Well, this is a toughie.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.795
Yeah, well, it could be worse.

18:04.080 --> 18:07.868
Look at the mountain
I gotta climb 12 times a year.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.315
Go. Go.

18:15.880 --> 18:18.758
Hey, Dad, you got
a couple of bucks we could...?

18:20.080 --> 18:23.516
He's gone. Our place.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.718
Look, we'll sneak
in right behind this guy.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.834
Hey, lemon head.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.997
You just cut right in front of me.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.073
Oh, yeah?
You got something to say?

18:41.320 --> 18:42.992
Say it to him.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.759
Don't say it to me. I didn't do...

18:54.400 --> 18:56.277
It's a good life.

18:57.040 --> 19:00.999
Well, Mrs. Bundy,
you've got less than a minute left.

19:02.760 --> 19:06.594
Listen, Mr. Dees, Al's home.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.271
Hi, honey.

19:15.440 --> 19:20.070
I may be insipid
and smell like rotting flesh...

19:20.960 --> 19:24.589
...but I'm home for sex. Burp.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.833
Let's bump uglies.

19:29.800 --> 19:33.509
- Oh, Al.
- Oh, Peg.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.990
Oh, right.

19:36.840 --> 19:40.355
Look, this isn't Oprah, ladies.
I'm sorry, your time is up.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.160
But for playing along,
you'll get a consolation prize.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.391
This is Rick Dees...

19:45.640 --> 19:47.119
Did we win? Did we win?

19:47.360 --> 19:50.432
I had to stop off at the drugstore
and get some marital aids.

19:50.680 --> 19:54.036
I got breath mints for you
and Wild Turkey for me.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.838
Let's do it! Are we too late?

20:02.080 --> 20:05.038
- Well, actually...
- Actually, no, we're not.

20:05.280 --> 20:09.558
We still have three minutes left.
We could do it six times.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.438
Great. Great, Peg. You go upstairs,
I'll put the chicken out.

20:20.120 --> 20:24.989
Al, hurry.
We only have two minutes left.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.272
I can't believe it.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.552
The guy ahead of us gets
the last ticket, and what do I get?

20:35.800 --> 20:38.314
I spend three days of my life
with you.

20:39.360 --> 20:43.638
Three days! Oh, sure,
it might be fun for the Navy, but...

20:47.200 --> 20:48.872
Like you had anything better to do...

20:49.080 --> 20:52.595
...than dunk your girlfriend in water
to see where the leak was.

20:54.400 --> 20:58.154
Hey, at least she has an excuse
for having air in her head.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.434
That is, if I had a rubber girlfriend.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.755
Which I don't.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.316
Not anymore.

21:22.520 --> 21:26.433
I just know if we had gotten in,
Dung would have bashed in my teeth.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.113
This is all Dad's fault.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.038
I'm not gonna let him
get away with it.

21:30.280 --> 21:33.556
I say we stay home tonight
and we make his life miserable.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.914
Where are you guys going?

21:48.160 --> 21:50.993
To the Burned Beyond Recognition
concert.

21:51.240 --> 21:54.789
It was our consolation prize
from the Rick Dees show.

21:55.680 --> 21:59.275
Wait, Dad's the reason we don't
have tickets. We should have them.

21:59.520 --> 22:00.919
Are you kidding?

22:01.160 --> 22:04.232
You don't know what I had to
go through to get those tickets.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.595
You don't know where I've been.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.874
And believe me, it wasn't Tahiti.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.198
You guys don't even like BBR.

22:20.680 --> 22:24.753
Well, I don't like
S-E-X with M-O-M either.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.558
But it's my J-O-B.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.595
- Let's go, Peg.
- Oh, Al, I'm so excited.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.398
- Front-row seats.
- Yeah.

22:33.640 --> 22:38.077
Just remember to smile big at the band
and show them your teeth.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.712
Honey, you think they'll really notice?

22:44.920 --> 22:47.070
Oh, I hope so, Peg.
