00:01.502 --> 00:04.638
KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:04.672 --> 00:08.276
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.178
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.211 --> 00:11.645
and by the time I got here,

00:11.679 --> 00:16.550
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.320
I hid who I really was
until one day,

00:19.353 --> 00:22.523
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:22.556 --> 00:26.094
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:26.127 --> 00:29.530
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.563 --> 00:31.432
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.465 --> 00:34.068
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.436 --> 00:38.038
I am Supergirl.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.774
Previously on Supergirl...

00:40.808 --> 00:42.410
I care about you.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.278
-Well...
-I get that you don't
care about me.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.847
-I do care about you.
-But not in the same way.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.550
That's fine. That's...
It's okay.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.385
My people,
they know where I am.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.155
They're coming.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.593
-(MUSIC PLAYING)
-(LAUGHTER)

01:12.273 --> 01:14.542
-Club soda on the rocks.
-Thank you.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.613
Uh, hey, Mon-El?

01:20.548 --> 01:21.482
Yeah.

01:21.515 --> 01:26.187
So, I know things have been
a little weird

01:26.220 --> 01:29.223
since that conversation
we had the other night.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.559
Right.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.427
You know, I've been talking
to some of the regulars

01:33.461 --> 01:35.896
and apparently Earth males
are only supposed to express

01:35.929 --> 01:40.434
their feelings about sports
and, occasionally,
monster trucks. So...

01:40.468 --> 01:44.372
No, it was great that
you were honest.

01:44.405 --> 01:47.341
That's actually a trait
women like in men.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.178
But here's the thing, um,

01:52.213 --> 01:53.547
you were right.

01:55.249 --> 01:58.118
I'm not so sure
we're a good match.

02:00.654 --> 02:04.225
Yeah. Yeah, no.
I'm just glad we're
on the same page, you know.

02:04.258 --> 02:08.262
I mean, I have
my career in journalism
that I just started out on.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.298
In the meantime,
when I'm not being Supergirl,

02:10.331 --> 02:12.266
I really need
to focus on that.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.402
And even if I did have time
to date someone,

02:14.435 --> 02:16.404
I wouldn't date
someone like...

02:17.805 --> 02:19.740
Someone who... Who...

02:19.773 --> 02:22.610
-Who is...
-An intergalactic bartender?

02:22.643 --> 02:23.711
-Yes!
-Yes.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.413
No. It's...

02:25.446 --> 02:28.416
Because it's not your job.

02:28.449 --> 02:31.419
It's... It's the way you are.

02:34.988 --> 02:38.158
I'm going to go
over there now.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.361
Okay.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.300
Oh, that looked serious.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.437
He told me he liked me
the other day.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.539
I'm so shocked.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.342
-Was it that obvious?
-Duh!

02:54.375 --> 02:57.378
Well, I don't like him,
and I had to tell him

02:57.411 --> 02:59.813
and I just shoved both feet
into my mouth.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.282
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

03:01.315 --> 03:04.285
It was, though.
It really, really was.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.954
(SIGHS) But on to more
important things.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.422
-Earth birthday!
-Yes!

03:08.456 --> 03:11.692
13 years since
I crashed here on Earth.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.827
So, I know we always
just do cupcakes,

03:13.861 --> 03:16.597
but I was thinking
we should go all out
for lucky number 13.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.499
I've always wanted to try
country line dancing,

03:18.532 --> 03:20.734
so I made us this
reservation at a club.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.570
If we get there before 7:00,

03:22.603 --> 03:25.005
they teach us
all these tutorials
and the dances!

03:25.038 --> 03:28.976
Oh, I should call them
and make sure that
we can rent cowboy boots.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.879
Uh, well, about
Earth birthday...

03:31.912 --> 03:36.016
I know we celebrate
every year, but the thing is,

03:36.049 --> 03:38.786
that, um,
Maggie surprised me

03:38.819 --> 03:43.724
with concert tickets to the
Barenaked Ladies tonight.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.394
-Oh...
-And, um,

03:46.427 --> 03:49.397
she knows that I've loved them
since college.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.832
It would be our first concert
together and so,

03:51.865 --> 03:54.435
you know, I was...
Maybe if there's...

03:54.468 --> 03:57.771
Do you think we can
celebrate another night?

03:58.839 --> 04:00.574
Oh, my God! (GASPING)

04:00.608 --> 04:02.543
You are not going
to believe this.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.612
One of the guys at my precinct
is working security
at the venue tonight

04:04.645 --> 04:07.981
and he was able to upgrade
our tickets to VIP!

04:08.015 --> 04:10.618
-Boom!
-Oh, my God! That's amazing.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.286
That's great.

04:12.786 --> 04:13.887
That's great.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.023
Is everything okay?

04:16.056 --> 04:19.460
Sounds like you guys are gonna
have a lot of fun tonight.

04:19.493 --> 04:23.531
-Are you sure?
-Go! Go! Have fun.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.333
Okay.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.800
Okay. Bye. Go.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.044
Kara, you all right?

04:37.077 --> 04:39.313
Can I get you
anything to drink?

04:39.347 --> 04:43.517
Just get me something strong.

04:43.551 --> 04:46.787
Actually, you know what,
I'll have what he's having.

04:46.820 --> 04:50.658
Oh, he's been drinking
exclusively club soda
for the last week.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.626
Really?

04:53.727 --> 04:55.729
Oh.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.766
I'll just stick with
my club soda then. Thank you.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.447
(RATTLING)

05:16.984 --> 05:18.852
I know you're there.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.930
I saw you yesterday, too.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.933
The old lady at the bus stop.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.703
And you were that little boy
in the park this morning.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.474
Yeah.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.410
Why are you following me?

05:42.443 --> 05:43.844
Do you regret letting me
out of that cell?

05:43.877 --> 05:45.479
-Of course not.
-But you still don't trust me!

05:45.513 --> 05:46.880
I do trust you.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.116
It's just what you said,
your people know
where you are,

05:49.149 --> 05:51.952
the White Martians are coming.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.389
As an agent of the DEO,
I have a duty
to protect this Earth.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.126
If any of those monsters
show up, I have to be ready.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.861
Well, like I said,
they're coming.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.431
They're not here yet.
So, you can stop...

06:03.464 --> 06:04.865
(ROARING)

06:13.941 --> 06:15.643
M'orzz!

06:18.646 --> 06:19.980
(GRUNTS)

06:33.861 --> 06:35.529
Mind if I cut in?

07:06.059 --> 07:08.195
I didn't know if we'd
see you tonight.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.797
Why wouldn't you be?

07:09.830 --> 07:13.033
Thought you might be off
Guardian-ing or whatever.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.170
You understand I'm just
worried about you.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.039
You don't have
to worry about me.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.008
You got beaten up
a few weeks ago.
You could have been killed.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.242
Hmm. Hmm.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.011
I know James thinks
he has a calling,

07:24.044 --> 07:26.013
but you have to see how crazy
this is, right?

07:26.046 --> 07:28.716
Have you ever thought that
maybe I have a calling, too?

07:30.818 --> 07:32.219
What have you found,
Agent Schott?

07:32.252 --> 07:34.955
(CLEARS THROAT) Nothing yet.
This guy is hard to track.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.925
But we're monitoring every
probable target

07:37.958 --> 07:39.493
so when he does attack...
(CLICKS TONGUE)

07:39.527 --> 07:40.694
...we'll be ready.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.496
In that case, I'll prep
our strike teams.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.965
J'onn, you should stay
here at the DEO.
For protection.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.901
It's not here for J'onn.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.136
It's here for me.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.838
Hunting me.

07:50.871 --> 07:54.041
The White Martians want me
to pay for my war crimes.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.676
They're telling me.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.878
-Psychically.
-Then you have to remain here.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.146
If you go outside,
you're vulnerable.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.714
I can't put you all in danger.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.015
That's what we do.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.151
We protect people.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.554
I don't need protection.

08:06.587 --> 08:09.557
M'gann.
You're making a big mistake.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.024
Risking yourself helps no one.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.860
This is my fight, J'onn.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.835
You're cut off after this one.

08:32.846 --> 08:33.981
Armek.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.917
(SPEAKING MARTIAN)

08:40.087 --> 08:41.855
Don't call me that.

08:41.889 --> 08:45.659
Would you prefer it in
the human tongue, wife?

08:45.693 --> 08:47.260
I am no longer bonded to you.

08:47.294 --> 08:51.264
The nest has been cold
these 300 years
without you.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.066
It was always cold.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.805
You've been impersonating
a Green.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.574
How do you live with yourself?

09:00.608 --> 09:03.611
I thought you were dead,
and I suppose it gave me
some comfort.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.847
Your parting gift.

09:06.880 --> 09:11.018
No, you didn't kill me,
but you came closer
than anyone ever will.

09:12.953 --> 09:16.089
I've come to bring you back
to Mars, k'onahr.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.125
Your treachery is legend.

09:18.158 --> 09:21.629
The Council wants to see you
dead more than J'onn J'onzz.

09:21.662 --> 09:25.032
And I will satisfy H'ronmeer,
God of Death,

09:25.065 --> 09:29.670
by watering
the desiccated plains
of T'ozz with your blood.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.672
I will never go back.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.607
Oh, but you should see it.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.643
With the eradication
of the vermin,

09:35.676 --> 09:37.645
Mars is a paradise.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.647
The way it was
intended to be.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.720
The Greens have
been silenced.

09:46.754 --> 09:49.122
The ones who thought
they were better than us.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.959
We are now one pure hive.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.894
So, who are you
going to kill next?

09:53.927 --> 09:56.096
What other species deserves
to be obliterated

09:56.129 --> 09:58.666
because you decide
you're better than them?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.034
Whichever one we choose.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.403
I'm not afraid of you.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.773
Maybe not.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.340
But I don't need to bond
with you to know

10:07.374 --> 10:11.679
that J'onn J'onzz
and the Kryptonian
are your friends.

10:11.712 --> 10:15.015
(SIGHS) This has nothing
to do with them.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.085
If you ever cared for me,
you'll leave them alone.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.189
I'm going to make
this very simple.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.694
You have two hours
to turn yourself over to me.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.096
If you do,
I may let them live.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.232
If you don't...

10:32.265 --> 10:36.837
Let's just say, I'm glad
you made friends here
on Earth, M'gann.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.740
It will be such a pleasure
to watch them burn.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.226
HANK HENSHAW:
Where are you going?

11:02.796 --> 11:03.897
I'm leaving.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.899
They'll just find you again.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.334
I've put you all in danger.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.169
I need to get out of here.
For everyone's sake.

11:09.202 --> 11:13.106
M'gann, I spent
many lifetimes running,

11:13.140 --> 11:15.776
convinced I was on
this Earth alone,

11:15.809 --> 11:18.278
no one to call family,
no one to call a friend.

11:18.311 --> 11:22.182
I refused to open my eyes
to what was right
in front of me.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.252
People who were willing to
take a chance.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.755
It's taken me
hundreds of years to learn
to trust again after...

11:27.788 --> 11:29.456
After what my people did.

11:29.489 --> 11:32.059
You are not your people.

11:32.092 --> 11:35.963
Okay? You are kind
and you are generous

11:35.996 --> 11:37.931
and willing to put yourself
before others.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.767
You are different.
I know that now.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.836
Then you know that
I can't just stay here

11:42.870 --> 11:46.306
and let these monsters
hurt you and your friends.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.076
They're not just my friends,
they're your friends, too.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.245
And they want to protect you.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.216
Please. Don't run away.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.121
Trust us.

12:09.897 --> 12:13.233
(MUSIC PLAYING)

12:13.266 --> 12:17.304
Man, the last time I saw them,
I think I was in college.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.273
-What about you?
-What?

12:21.842 --> 12:25.412
Oh, I don't remember.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.248
You know, for a super-fan,
you are not that excited.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.250
No, I am. I promise.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.119
Really? Because I've
seen your face

12:32.152 --> 12:34.087
when you defeat
a blood-thirsty alien.

12:34.121 --> 12:37.791
I know what excited
Alex Danvers looks like,
and this isn't quite it.

12:37.825 --> 12:41.428
No. This is...
It's perfect, all of it.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.763
I just... Kara...

12:44.865 --> 12:46.433
(SIGHS)
I think I hurt her feelings.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.535
That's... So... I'm sorry.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.839
I don't need you to be sorry,
I just wanted you to have fun.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.406
And right now,
something's eating at you.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.208
No. No.

12:55.242 --> 12:58.411
I'm just distracted.
So, now...

12:58.445 --> 13:01.882
I'll forget about it
for the rest of the evening.
I promise.

13:01.915 --> 13:05.986
You know, the days of you
pushing down your feelings
are officially over.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.588
So go. Go talk to your sister.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.058
-Really?
-Yeah. I'll meet you there.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.160
(KISSING)

13:13.193 --> 13:14.394
You're the best.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.531
Hey.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.067
Shouldn't you be
at your concert?

13:20.100 --> 13:22.069
Ah, well,
I wanted to check in.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.403
I was just going
to get an update,

13:23.436 --> 13:25.072
but I don't think
we've found anything yet.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.474
No. I mean I wanted
to check in about us.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.077
I'm... I'm sorry I bailed
on your Earth birthday.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.478
You made all those plans.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.848
I made them this morning,
it's not a big deal.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.049
This morning?

13:36.083 --> 13:37.918
-So last-minute of you.
-I know.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.020
I know I got
a little over-excited.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.922
But it... It's okay.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.191
We can celebrate
another night.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.593
So, you're not mad at me?

13:46.626 --> 13:49.062
(GIGGLES) No, no, no,
I am not mad.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.164
Because it really felt like
you were mad at me.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.933
And then I felt guilty
for trying to have fun.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.535
Alex, I was being immature.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.905
I want you to have fun
with your girlfriend, it's...

13:57.938 --> 13:59.472
It's not a big deal,
it's fine.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.108
-You promise?
-Absolutely.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.184
You find out anything else?

14:11.218 --> 14:12.652
All is clear on
the Martian front.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.289
We were about to game plan
some new tracking techniques.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.258
M'gann. You're here.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.028
I want to help in
any way that I can.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.096
I hate them even
more than you do.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.631
It's very brave
of you to come.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.633
We'll do everything
we can to keep you safe.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.236
Agent Schott,
let's brief M'gann
on what we know so far.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.238
-Yep, come on.
-Come on.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.145
Guys...

14:38.178 --> 14:40.948
J'onn, I thought
about what you said...

14:40.981 --> 14:42.282
Oh, my God.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.053
Wait. If she's here
and she...

14:46.086 --> 14:48.922
-Oh, no.
-No. No.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.926
You Greens never learn,
do you?

14:54.027 --> 14:55.462
(GRUNTING)

15:30.330 --> 15:32.932
COMPUTER:
Auxiliary power activated.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.270
He's gone!

15:43.443 --> 15:45.512
COMPUTER:
Lock-down mode initiated.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.549
Why are you putting us
in lock-down?

15:49.582 --> 15:51.651
The only way to catch that
thing is to trap it in here.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.054
-With us?
-We don't even know
where it went.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.489
Or where it didn't go.
It could still be here.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.992
It could be any of us.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.073
This is everyone
who was inside when
the doors shut.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.307
If one of us is
a White Martian,

16:14.341 --> 16:16.209
how do we tell who's
really themselves?

16:16.243 --> 16:18.745
Oh, that's easy, we just have
to ask personal questions.

16:18.778 --> 16:22.015
Right, like, things we only
would know the answer to.

16:22.049 --> 16:24.351
Like what's the scented
candle that I hate?

16:24.384 --> 16:27.487
-Teak wood and tobacco.
-No. They can read minds, too.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.089
They know
all your preferences,

16:29.122 --> 16:31.024
everything that makes you
who you are.

16:35.295 --> 16:38.065
-What are you looking at?
-What?

16:38.098 --> 16:39.799
-All right. Hey!
-Whoa, whoa!

16:39.832 --> 16:42.202
-Holster your sidearms!
-Yes, do that, please.

16:42.235 --> 16:45.638
-I wasn't looking at you.
-Yes, she was.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.240
She's the White Martian.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.078
Now you really
better put that away.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.646
But it could be her.
It could be any of you.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.681
Stop pointing your weapon.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.616
-Then back off!
-Come on!

16:56.649 --> 16:57.717
We're not going
to lose it here.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.352
J'onn, you can read minds.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.355
Can you scan us
to see who's who?

17:13.433 --> 17:14.834
No, I can't.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.669
There's some kind
of psychic interference.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.571
Well, that's convenient.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.773
He's after me.
I should turn myself over.
Maybe he'll let you go.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.542
Great idea.
Mission accomplished.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.112
-Absolutely not.
-That is not how we do things.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.579
It's all my fault.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.148
I'm the one who
sealed us in here.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.316
No, you don't understand.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.518
This isn't just any
White Martian.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.053
Armek was my mate.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.358
Mate, like your husband?

17:38.391 --> 17:40.227
It's not the same
for White Martians.

17:40.260 --> 17:43.663
It was an arrangement,
not a choice, but yes.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.232
We were bonded.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.533
And you all have
a right to know

17:46.566 --> 17:48.168
that he is the worst
of my kind.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.237
Oh, well, that makes me
feel so much better.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.771
-It doesn't matter who he is.
-J'onn's right.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.806
We're going to find him
and we're going to beat him.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.176
First things first.
I'm going to collect
everybody's sidearms.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.844
-Are you crazy?
-Will somebody take his gun?

17:57.877 --> 17:59.612
(CLAMORING)

17:59.646 --> 18:01.381
All right! That's enough!

18:02.849 --> 18:06.586
There is one way to determine
who is the White Martian
and who isn't.

18:06.619 --> 18:07.620
How?

18:15.728 --> 18:20.433
There was a time when
we were in hiding on Mars.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.236
Trying to build a resistance
to the White Martians.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.673
We worked out of
a network of caves,

18:26.706 --> 18:28.608
but they would infiltrate us,

18:30.310 --> 18:32.512
send in spies to wreak havoc.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.884
Anyone who came through
the mouth of the cave

18:37.917 --> 18:39.652
had to put
their hand to the fire.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.488
What did the fire do?

18:42.855 --> 18:44.257
This.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.362
Okay, that's not
creepy at all.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.164
(LAUGHS)

18:51.898 --> 18:53.300
Do Vasquez first.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.168
She was so quick to deny
that she's a Martian.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.136
Because I'm not, you moron.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.287
Now him.

19:34.607 --> 19:35.742
MEGAN: J'onn...

19:37.844 --> 19:39.312
You okay?

19:41.848 --> 19:42.849
J'onn...

19:42.882 --> 19:44.451
He's not doing it.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.593
(SPEAKING MARTIAN)

20:24.357 --> 20:25.558
-Winn?
-Hmm?

20:25.592 --> 20:26.259
You're up.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.861
Oh, wait, seriously? It's me.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.597
Everyone has to do it.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.367
Okay. Geez. (CHUCKLES)

20:40.673 --> 20:41.741
You got me.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.242
(GRUNTS)

20:44.344 --> 20:45.645
(YELLING)

20:51.618 --> 20:52.752
(CHOKES)

20:54.754 --> 20:58.525
I'm so glad you didn't turn
yourself in, my love.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.627
I would have missed
all the fun.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.531
(GRUNTING)

21:12.405 --> 21:13.773
(ZAPPING)

21:21.348 --> 21:22.549
(GRUNTS)

21:25.685 --> 21:28.421
I can't believe it was Winn
and I didn't know.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.690
None of us knew.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.826
No, thanks. I'm armed.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.798
-You okay?
-Yeah.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.802
The motion sensor is offline.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.704
Thank God the containment
cells are still locked.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.573
As Winn, he had access
to the whole system.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.441
-(ALARM BLARING)
-Now what?

21:48.475 --> 21:50.510
-It's the reactor.
-What reactor?

21:50.543 --> 21:52.812
The one that powers
the building.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.448
-It's going into overload.
-What does that mean?

21:55.482 --> 21:57.950
It means he sabotaged it.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.887
This whole building
is going to explode.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.890
And it's going to take
ten city blocks with it.

22:11.063 --> 22:12.599
Why would he wanna blow
the building up?

22:12.632 --> 22:14.434
He's inside, too, he'll die.

22:14.467 --> 22:15.835
It doesn't matter to Armek.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.837
He'd proudly give his life
to complete his mission.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.573
-Can we shut it down manually?
-No.

22:20.607 --> 22:21.974
The White Martian
who took Winn's form

22:22.008 --> 22:23.876
also took his intelligence
and re-encoded everything.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.478
We're locked out
of the entire system.

22:25.512 --> 22:26.913
So, we need the real
Winn to unlock it.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.848
How do we know that
Winn's even in the building?

22:28.881 --> 22:31.951
In order for Armek
to shape-shift into Winn
so exactly,

22:31.984 --> 22:34.821
he'd have to be close by,
to keep the telepathic link.

22:34.854 --> 22:35.988
He's in the DEO.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.658
Can't Supergirl X-ray vision
the building to find him?

22:38.691 --> 22:42.729
No. Someone lined the walls
of the building with lead.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.864
We need to search
the building.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.733
How long until
the reactor explodes?

22:46.766 --> 22:49.902
According to our calculations,
about 15 minutes.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.438
Vasquez, Demos,

22:51.471 --> 22:52.839
you take two teams
up through the north wing.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.774
Supergirl, Alex,
you hit the basement.

22:54.807 --> 22:55.942
Let's go.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.517
Psst!

23:05.051 --> 23:06.519
(INAUDIBLE)

23:07.787 --> 23:08.555
What?

23:08.588 --> 23:09.956
(WHISPERING)
Look around the corner.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.390
Oh. Oh.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.662
All clear.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.833
We're not so good
at communicating
these days, are we?

23:20.867 --> 23:22.669
I was mad before.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.937
About Earth birthday.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.473
I knew it.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.740
I owe you an apology.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.709
I shouldn't have
bailed on you.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.479
It hurt my feelings.

23:32.512 --> 23:33.780
(SIGHS) I know.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.250
It wasn't fair.

23:38.284 --> 23:41.521
Look, I don't want to feel bad
for wanting to spend
time with Maggie.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.523
You shouldn't.
It's a good thing.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.759
(SIGHS) It's just...

23:48.528 --> 23:53.232
Ever since I've been on Earth,
I don't know
what life is like,

23:53.265 --> 23:55.668
without you there
all the time.

23:55.702 --> 23:59.839
And I felt that changing
and it's just...

24:00.973 --> 24:01.974
Scary.

24:03.976 --> 24:07.714
When my parents put me on
that pod in Krypton, I...

24:09.882 --> 24:12.885
I don't think I realized
what was actually happening.

24:15.121 --> 24:19.726
I didn't know
that I was saying
goodbye to them forever.

24:21.594 --> 24:25.464
I've been abandoned before,
and I didn't wanna be
abandoned again.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.867
I will never abandon you.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.137
(CRASH)

24:31.170 --> 24:33.606
-What was that?
-Let's find out.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.982
We're not going to be able
to find him in time.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.617
I should have handled
this on my own.

24:44.651 --> 24:45.885
I'd never let you do that.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.587
I know you think
it's your duty, but...

24:47.620 --> 24:49.722
It's not just my duty, M'gann.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.560
It's more than that.

24:54.894 --> 24:59.065
You've become
dear to me in a way
no one has been since...

25:04.036 --> 25:05.237
I just had this

25:08.174 --> 25:12.745
huge hole in my heart
for so long now.
I never thought...

25:12.779 --> 25:15.582
Dreamed that anybody would
be able to fill it.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.019
When I realized you
were a White Martian,

25:20.052 --> 25:23.856
I never thought that
that person would be...

25:26.793 --> 25:27.794
You.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.799
But I was wrong.

25:34.634 --> 25:37.536
Your spirit is so
beautiful and brave.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.675
Now that I'm able
to see that,

25:45.745 --> 25:47.914
I can't imagine my life
without you.

25:49.816 --> 25:52.284
I'm brave because you
showed me how to be.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.053
I'll protect you, M'gann.

25:56.322 --> 25:57.690
Forever.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.796
J'onn...

26:04.230 --> 26:05.665
(GASPS)

26:05.698 --> 26:06.966
Be careful.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.111
HANK HENSHAW: Winn!

26:20.246 --> 26:21.614
What's that?

26:31.658 --> 26:33.960
Oh, my God.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.962
-(ON COMM) Supergirl!
-What's up, J'onn?

26:35.995 --> 26:39.131
We were wrong!
There are two White Martians
in the building.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.301
-What?
-It's Alex!

26:42.334 --> 26:45.705
The other White Martian has
shape-shifted into Alex!

26:47.073 --> 26:48.140

Maybe heat vision isn't
a good idea

27:16.703 --> 27:19.638
in a room with an unstable
nuclear reactor.

27:22.308 --> 27:25.778
Then I guess
we're gonna have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

27:29.849 --> 27:33.019
-Winn!
-Ow! Why?

27:33.052 --> 27:35.788

White Martians are here!

27:37.289 --> 27:40.392
Yes. Yes, and the building
is going to explode.

27:40.426 --> 27:41.761
We've got to get out of here!

27:41.794 --> 27:43.930
-No. No. No.
-No? Why no?

27:43.963 --> 27:45.832
The White Martians infiltrated
the reactor in the basement.

27:45.865 --> 27:49.268
And I need you to shut it
down before the whole
thing overloads.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.738
No. Damn it.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.773
No. I can't shut it
down remotely.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.775
I have to go
to the reactor room.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.243
Then let's get
to the reactor room.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.811

She's still a little
out of it.

she's okay.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.711
Thank you for saving me.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.447
I should be thanking you.

33:02.581 --> 33:05.217
I've been on my own

33:09.755 --> 33:12.058
Though I had a mother,

33:12.091 --> 33:14.260
she wasn't warm,
that's not our way,

33:14.293 --> 33:17.096
but she cared for me.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.565
I know she did.

33:19.598 --> 33:22.501
And I'd forgotten
that feeling until now...

33:22.534 --> 33:25.037
What it feels like
to have a family.

33:26.772 --> 33:29.075
Which is what makes
this so hard.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.245
I'm going back to Mars.

33:33.279 --> 33:34.480
Why?

33:34.513 --> 33:36.715
There must be other

White Martians who have
the desire and the capacity
to change,

33:41.487 --> 33:43.622
who don't want to be defined
by the hatred of our kind,

33:43.655 --> 33:48.160
but just need a push
to do the right thing.

33:49.561 --> 33:52.131
They could kill you
as soon as you land.

33:52.164 --> 33:55.667
Maybe, but if I don't try,

33:55.701 --> 33:59.205
they're never going to
stop hunting me.
You know that's true.

34:00.439 --> 34:05.211
You've shown me what it is
to stand up and fight.

34:06.312 --> 34:08.647

I'm going to do.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.584

-You're welcome.

35:02.168 --> 35:04.470
Was Maggie mad that
you missed the concert?

35:04.503 --> 35:07.206
Well, luckily,
I have a girlfriend
that understands

35:07.239 --> 35:12.478
when deadly aliens besiege
my place of work,
that takes precedence.

35:12.511 --> 35:15.381
Yeah, I'm glad
everyone is okay.

35:15.414 --> 35:17.783
That last White Martian...
Oof!

35:17.816 --> 35:21.520
First of all, boy, did it do
a good impression of you,

35:21.553 --> 35:25.357
and second,
you got there just in time.

35:25.391 --> 35:29.161
Uh, speaking of that
White Martian, um...

35:29.961 --> 35:32.298
When it was me,

35:32.331 --> 35:35.234
did you have
a conversation?

35:35.267 --> 35:38.237
Because I have these memories.
They're like a...

35:38.270 --> 35:41.240
Almost like a dream,
that we talked.

35:41.273 --> 35:45.177
But I'm not really
sure if that was real.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.347
Do you remember?

35:49.215 --> 35:51.283
Yeah. So I'm not crazy?

35:51.817 --> 35:53.151
Nope.

35:54.286 --> 35:57.856
I guess if the White Martian's
bond is strong enough,

35:57.889 --> 36:00.659
the telepathy goes both ways.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.194
Yeah. I guess so.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.297
Kara.

36:05.331 --> 36:07.733
I'm not ever going anywhere.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.536
I promise.

36:10.569 --> 36:11.937
Just because I'm with Maggie,

36:11.970 --> 36:14.373
it doesn't mean
I'm not with you...

36:14.406 --> 36:16.442
-Always.
-I know. I...

36:19.445 --> 36:22.248
I guess I made those big plans

36:22.281 --> 36:25.284
because I wanted the day
to be extra special.

36:26.485 --> 36:29.821
I felt you were slipping away.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.224
I'm not. Ever.

36:34.593 --> 36:39.197
But is that the only reason
you made such big plans?

36:39.831 --> 36:41.233
What do you mean?

36:41.267 --> 36:43.702
Look, sometimes, you know,
in our life,

36:43.735 --> 36:45.904
when one part
is really confusing,

36:45.937 --> 36:51.577
we will pour way more
attention than necessary
into another.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.812
And, you know,
you looked a bit

36:53.845 --> 36:57.549
overwhelmed when
you talked to Mon-El.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.851
So, maybe the reason
that you made
such big plans with me

36:59.885 --> 37:01.853
was so that you didn't
have to think about

37:01.887 --> 37:05.324
how you actually
feel about him.

37:05.357 --> 37:06.592
I told him how I feel.

37:06.625 --> 37:09.461
Mmm-hmm.
And you really believe that?

37:14.800 --> 37:15.867
He's complicated.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.336
Mmm-hmm.

37:18.504 --> 37:21.340
But it's not just about him,
it's about me.

37:23.442 --> 37:26.845
Every time I put myself out
there, it backfires.

37:26.878 --> 37:30.716
I don't want it to happen
again, it's too risky.

have taken a rather big

37:35.321 --> 37:36.755

I will let them know
that you're going away.

38:12.090 --> 38:13.859
J'onn, about what
you said before...

38:13.892 --> 38:15.427
I shouldn't have
said anything.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.429
It was totally inappropriate.

38:18.397 --> 38:19.698
I feel it, too.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.569
I have for a while.
I just didn't...

38:25.404 --> 38:26.838
Know what it was.

I've just had
one of the hardest

I probably won't survive,
