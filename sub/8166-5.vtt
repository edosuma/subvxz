"Flamingo position."

her last name.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.689
Virginia Ann Groves?

19:08.772 --> 19:10.315
Her monogram is VAG.

19:15.612 --> 19:19.408
I'll be right back.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.034
Hello.
- Caroline.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.244
We'd hoped we'd see you here.
- Oh, why?

19:22.327 --> 19:26.164
{\an3}So you could rub it in my face
that I'm still single?

19:26.248 --> 19:27.499
Well, guess what.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.209
{\an3}Jacob got engaged
to another woman today,

19:29.293 --> 19:30.752
and I actually helped.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.422
{\an3}And I realized I don't need
to get married.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.756
I don't need a man.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.383
I don't need anyone.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.176
I can sit at home all day

19:38.260 --> 19:38.844
{\an3}watching
"International House Hunters"

19:38.927 --> 19:41.305
if that's what I want to do.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.764
I'm a survivor.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.474
I listen to Beyoncé!

19:44.558 --> 19:47.227
So...bow down, bitches!

19:47.311 --> 19:50.105
{\an1}- Well, we were gonna
give you my brother's number.

19:50.188 --> 19:52.566
He's a surgeon.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.276
- And I'll gladly take it.
