- Don't panic.
- Too late.

01:03.787 --> 01:04.753

is bad for you.

01:08.141 --> 01:10.091
Take a break.
Go cut open a body.

01:10.143 --> 01:12.093
Okay, they said
your apartment burned down

01:12.145 --> 01:14.429
- because of faulty wiring.
- They did.

01:14.431 --> 01:17.015
- But this is arson.
- It was.

01:17.067 --> 01:18.266

<i>Somebody picked

01:20.320 --> 01:22.270
Look, if ... [sighs]
if they wanted to hurt me,

01:22.322 --> 01:23.655
they would have broken
in when I was home.

01:23.690 --> 01:26.441
And these are the thoughts
that give you comfort?

01:26.493 --> 01:29.661
- Yeah.
- So, what about the hacking?

01:29.696 --> 01:32.414
Or the ... the damage to your credit

01:32.449 --> 01:35.413
- or the accounts being closed?
- They are open again,

01:35.448 --> 01:37.836
and I have a shiny, new credit card.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.339
Maura...

01:41.374 --> 01:44.426
Jane, someone burned
down your apartment!

01:44.461 --> 01:46.678
Yes. 
And then they told me about it.

01:46.713 --> 01:48.680
Okay, so, what else are
they gonna tell you about?

01:48.715 --> 01:51.683
Well, I don't know, Maura, but
I'm sure it's gonna be worse.

01:51.718 --> 01:52.701
Isn't that what you're thinking?

01:52.702 --> 01:53.685
'Cause that's what I'm thinking.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.304
That's what I lay awake
thinking about every night!

01:56.306 --> 01:58.189
Okay, I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry, Jane.

01:58.225 --> 02:00.308
I did not ... I did
not mean to upset you.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.811
No, I'm already upset.

02:02.813 --> 02:05.697
But I'm not gonna quit my job.
Then the bad guy wins.

02:07.367 --> 02:11.619
This is just...
it's a horrible burden on you.

02:11.655 --> 02:15.490
- I... I'm sure for Angela...
- No. No, no, no, no, no,

02:15.492 --> 02:16.741
she can't know anything about this.

02:16.793 --> 02:18.409
- Well, you have to tell her.
- No, I don't.

02:18.462 --> 02:21.296
And neither do you.
And you're not going to.

02:21.331 --> 02:23.331
That's why I'm showing you
this now so you can get ready.

02:23.383 --> 02:25.717
- Well, I can't lie.
- Yes, you can.

- Well, you're not going anywhere.
- What?

03:02.205 --> 03:03.755
Start pulling files of anybody
that may have a beef with you.

03:03.790 --> 03:05.423
Okay, I can do that when we get back.

03:05.458 --> 03:08.126
You put a lot of people away.
It'll be a big pile.

Well, this is interesting and sad.

She's got track marks, but they're old.
Scars have healed.

04:04.054 --> 04:05.770
It's possible she stopped
using some months ago.

04:05.806 --> 04:07.472
What's that?

04:09.559 --> 04:14.696
A tattoo of a butterfly.
Beautiful. And it's recent.

indicates a drug overdose,

04:26.493 --> 04:28.409
probably from cocaine.

04:28.462 --> 04:31.079
Well, she had plenty
of cash for a party.

04:31.131 --> 04:33.631
There wasn't one, though.
There were no drugs, no paraphernalia.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.501
And no cocaine residue around the nose.

04:36.503 --> 04:38.219
Perhaps she was injecting someplace

04:38.255 --> 04:40.505
the supervisors of the
halfway house wouldn't notice.

04:40.507 --> 04:42.590
Hey, doc, could you give me an
estimate of the victim's shoe size?

04:42.642 --> 04:44.843

04:47.430 --> 04:50.899
- That's a man's 12.
- Maybe he brought the party.

04:50.934 --> 04:54.519
- Let's find out who was here.
- And not invite him to my party.

[Printer whirs]

- Ooh, does it end differently?
- Kind of.

05:58.752 --> 06:02.136

Okay, I'm listening.

06:02.172 --> 06:04.138
Digital cameras shoot raw images.

06:04.174 --> 06:05.673
They're high-quality,
uncompressed files,

06:05.725 --> 06:08.142

edits into a standard frame.

That's what you see in the image viewer,
but the full image still exists.

you can see outside the frame.

Yeah. That's why it's fun.

can lead us to the arsonist.

- Wait, is that Lianne Sampson? 
- What?

06:43.013 --> 06:45.847
Uh, the victim from the
scene I just came from.

06:45.882 --> 06:47.548
She died of a drug overdose.

06:47.601 --> 06:50.768
She had a tattoo of a
butterfly on her left wrist.

06:50.804 --> 06:53.888
That's my murder victim.

06:53.940 --> 06:56.836
No, that's my murder victim.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.964
This threatening pile of
e-mails is all from women.

07:04.966 --> 07:09.435
- There's no Lianne Sampson.
- Anything mention arson or hacking?

07:09.470 --> 07:10.603
Maybe she used a different name.

07:10.638 --> 07:15.308
I have a "you're dead, bitch."
"Dead" is spelled d-e-d.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.859
I feel pretty good
about eliminating her.

07:16.894 --> 07:20.313
Yeah. As a suspect or
a spelling-bee contestant.

07:20.365 --> 07:21.731
Well, you don't need
to be a good speller

07:21.783 --> 07:23.366
to burn something down.

07:23.401 --> 07:24.900
No, but you do need
some degree of competence

07:24.953 --> 07:26.452
if you're gonna hack
into all my accounts.

07:26.487 --> 07:27.620
She could have hired
somebody to do that.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.955
Yeah.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.873
Lianne Sampson was
paroled two months ago

07:30.908 --> 07:34.660
- for petty theft.
- Petty theft...

07:34.696 --> 07:37.530
Lots of petty theft.

07:37.565 --> 07:38.998
No, I've never had any
contact with this woman.

07:39.033 --> 07:43.502
Throwaway kid in and out of group homes,
becomes a drug-addicted adult.

07:43.554 --> 07:45.805
But she's been sober
for the last six months.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.556
Not so sure about that.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.675
Part of her parole was that
she was tested every week.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.260
As of last Thursday, she was clean.

07:51.312 --> 07:52.928
What's her connection to Jane?

07:52.981 --> 07:55.264
- There is none.
- She burned down my apartment?

07:55.316 --> 07:59.352
Yeah, there's that.
We'll keep looking.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.271
- Okay.
- Maybe somebody hired her.

08:02.323 --> 08:03.689
Would explain all the
cash in her apartment.

08:03.691 --> 08:07.994
- A junkie will do a lot for 5 grand.
- Yeah. Yeah, I like that thinking.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.364
- I mean, I don't like that thinking.
- I got it. [Cellphone vibrates]

08:11.416 --> 08:15.701
Okay.
Nina just cracked Lianne's phone.

08:17.839 --> 08:19.789
[Keyboard clacking]

08:19.841 --> 08:21.374
Hey.

08:21.426 --> 08:23.042
There are lots of
texts from a Tom Hobert.

08:23.044 --> 08:26.595
- Every other word is "baby."
- So he was her boyfriend.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.348
Oh, yeah. 
There are months of these.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.599
But they end four weeks ago.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.467
Oh, right before she
torched my apartment.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.520
Okay. [Cellphone vibrating]
So, we need to talk to Mr. Hobert.

08:35.556 --> 08:38.057
It's Maura. [Beep]
Hi.

08:40.028 --> 08:41.443
Okay, I'll be right down.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.946
- [Beep] We'll take care of Hobert.
- Okay, thanks.

08:44.981 --> 08:50.403
- You have an address for this Hobert?
- Working on it.

08:51.906 --> 08:55.324
You rang?
Ish.

08:55.376 --> 08:56.826
I have a surprise for you.

08:56.878 --> 08:59.628
Oh, no, Dr. Frankenstein,
you shouldn't have.

09:01.416 --> 09:05.418
The fire inspector still had
your door in the evidence locker.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.802
I was thinking about what you said

09:06.838 --> 09:09.555
about having a very good
lock, so I brought it here,

09:09.590 --> 09:11.924
and you did, and it was picked.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.592
Well, they had to get in somehow.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.980
- The teeth are even.
- They bumped my lock?

09:18.015 --> 09:20.900
They struck the lock.
They withdrew. They repeated.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.319
They struck again until all
of the tumblers were open.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.938
This is a very sophisticated
lock-picking technique.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.657
Which rules out a drug
addict with no B&E priors.

09:28.693 --> 09:32.445
Yeah, but we're dealing with
someone smart and motivated, Jane.

09:32.497 --> 09:36.526
- I'm worried about you.
- I'd worry about the person

09:36.561 --> 09:39.001
<i>- who bumped my lock when I find them.
- Jane...</i>

09:39.036 --> 09:41.620
<i>Nobody bumps my lock, Maura.</i>

09:47.678 --> 09:51.380
- Thanks for coming.
- I'm kind of curious why

09:51.432 --> 09:52.631
you didn't want Jane to know I was here.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.633
I've drawn up a psychological profile

09:54.685 --> 09:56.519
- on the person who's after her.
- The arsonist?

09:56.554 --> 09:59.522
The person who hired the arsonist
and possibly the hacker.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.524
- You've ruled out Lianne Sampson?
- Yes.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.944
So, this individual has access to money.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.812
They're very good at
manipulating people,

10:06.814 --> 10:09.064
very smart, and very unpredictable.

10:09.117 --> 10:11.650
- You think Jane's in danger?
- I think Jane needs a bodyguard,

10:11.702 --> 10:13.402
which I will pay for myself.

10:13.454 --> 10:16.405
- Have you told her that?
- No.

10:16.457 --> 10:19.125
Look, Maura...

10:19.160 --> 10:21.794
I understand your concern.
I share your concern.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.280
Excellent. So, this is
the list of bodyguards

10:24.281 --> 10:25.915
that come highly recommended.

10:27.084 --> 10:28.667
They killed Lianne Sampson.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.504
Yes, and Jane is my best
chance of finding them.

10:31.556 --> 10:32.922
I'm not taking her out of commission.

10:32.974 --> 10:37.726
That would be counterproductive.
Thank you.

10:43.017 --> 10:47.069
- How did you meet Lianne?
- We started dating in rehab.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.071
You're not supposed to
date people from rehab.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.856
You're not supposed to step on a crack

10:50.858 --> 10:53.275
'cause you'll break your
mother's break, but you do.

10:53.327 --> 10:59.665
We were good together, you know?
She was an all-right chick.

10:59.700 --> 11:03.869
- Then what?
- There was a new guy, some dick.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.705
- But with money.
- Boyfriend?

11:06.707 --> 11:09.959
- Lianne said she was working for him.
- You didn't believe her?

11:10.011 --> 11:12.094
She wouldn't tell me what
she was doing for the money.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.046
She wouldn't even tell me his name.

11:14.098 --> 11:16.966
Did she tell you what he did or
how he looked or where he lived?

11:17.018 --> 11:20.085
- No.
- Not a curious guy, are you?

11:20.121 --> 11:25.891
Doesn't matter, all the details.
She was gonna start using again.

11:25.943 --> 11:29.528
You know what you call
an ex-junkie with cash?

11:29.564 --> 11:33.566
- A junkie.
- Hobert?

11:33.618 --> 11:38.787
This was fun.
Let's not do it again. [Sighs]

11:47.715 --> 11:50.249
[Elevator bell dings]
[Telephone rings]

11:55.590 --> 11:58.641
- Hi, Ma. What's up?
- You tell me.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.093
[Sighs] I do not have
the time for this today.

12:01.095 --> 12:05.264
- Something wrong?
- No, nothing's wrong. I'm just busy.

12:05.266 --> 12:10.185
- Uh, y-you didn't call me.
- I'm sorry.

12:10.238 --> 12:12.988
Uh, I-I didn't know that you called.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.024
Oh.

12:16.827 --> 12:20.663
Jane, you know what the silver cord is?

12:20.698 --> 12:23.532
If I pull it, will you disappear
so I can go back to work?

12:23.584 --> 12:25.668
[Chuckles] 
Ah, you're funny, Jane.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.146
No, it's the connection between
a mother and her child

12:28.147 --> 12:30.956
- that's always there.
- Right.

12:30.958 --> 12:35.961
Yes, I remember seeing
something about that on a show...

12:35.963 --> 12:37.630
or a birthday card.

12:37.682 --> 12:41.717
Mm. It lets a mother know when
there's trouble ... like now.

12:41.769 --> 12:42.968
[Cellphone vibrates] 
There's no trouble.

12:42.970 --> 12:45.804
- No?
- No. [Beep]

12:45.856 --> 12:47.106
[Sighs]

12:47.141 --> 12:48.974
It's Maura.
 It's important. I gotta go.

12:49.026 --> 12:50.726
Yeah, sure.

12:50.778 --> 12:52.227
Okay, I'll just worry
for the both of us.

12:52.280 --> 12:56.815
- Okay.
- I love you.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.097
I love you, too, Ma.

13:07.628 --> 13:10.245
There were five balloons of cocaine

13:10.298 --> 13:11.830
in Lianne Sampson's stomach.

13:11.882 --> 13:14.133
- So she was a mule?
- Maybe.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.051
No room for "maybe."

13:16.087 --> 13:19.004
I took pictures of the balloons,
and I had them blown up.

13:19.006 --> 13:21.724
- Unusual.
- All five balloons had

13:21.759 --> 13:24.810
a perfectly cylindrical
puncture under the lip.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.930
- So they were supposed to leak?
- Yes.

13:27.982 --> 13:31.183
Well, there are easier,
less-expensive ways to kill someone.

13:31.235 --> 13:34.186
It appears the person who killed
her doesn't care about money.

13:34.238 --> 13:36.939
That's strange. 
Especially for drug dealers.

13:36.991 --> 13:40.859
Even stranger, there was a
sixth balloon with less cocaine,

13:40.861 --> 13:43.696
- but it made room for the watch.
- "The watch"?

13:43.698 --> 13:48.334
A small watch for a girl or a woman,
and the battery was removed.

13:48.369 --> 13:52.570
- So it could be set for a specific time.
- 5:26.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.040
Doesn't tell us much.

13:55.092 --> 13:57.676
Well, it's within a half-hour
of my estimated time of death.

13:57.712 --> 14:01.504
- It's clever, but still...
- There's also a date ... the 26th.

14:02.183 --> 14:04.183
That's tomorrow.

14:06.020 --> 14:08.993
And this is my watch.

14:14.106 --> 14:17.228
<i>Korsak: We have until
5:26 P.M. tomorrow. </i>

14:17.264 --> 14:20.348
Finding whoever killed Lianne
Sampson is your first priority.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.766
It's your only priority.

14:21.768 --> 14:25.687
- This watch is a ticking clock.
- Non-ticking clock.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.021
It's a message.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.440
Whoever put this in
Lianne Sampson's stomach

14:28.442 --> 14:31.743
wanted us to find it.
Nina?

14:31.778 --> 14:33.445
Detective Rizzoli's
apartment burned down.

14:33.497 --> 14:36.915
Then someone accessed her financials,
but they didn't steal anything.

14:36.950 --> 14:38.450
They just used that
crime to send us a video,

14:38.502 --> 14:40.201
which showed that the
apartment fire was arson.

14:40.253 --> 14:42.120
Lianne Sampson is murdered,

14:42.122 --> 14:44.422
and we're given a watch
with a time and a date.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.424
Every piece of this,
we've been one step behind.

14:46.460 --> 14:47.792
That stops right now.

14:47.844 --> 14:49.461
Nobody goes home. 
Nobody sleeps.

14:49.513 --> 14:52.797
Every lead, every thought,
every whisper comes through me.

14:52.849 --> 14:55.100
That clear? 
Is that clear?

14:55.135 --> 14:56.301
What the hell's going on?

14:58.221 --> 15:02.474
I am not gonna be pushed out of
an investigation that involves me.

15:02.476 --> 15:04.809
It's because it involves you
that you can't be involved.

15:04.811 --> 15:06.111
That doesn't even make sense.

15:06.146 --> 15:09.280
Look, I can't conduct an investigation
into whoever's targeting you

15:09.316 --> 15:11.149
and keep you safe from
them at the same time!

15:11.151 --> 15:13.318
- I never asked you to keep me safe!
- Well, you should!

15:13.320 --> 15:14.953
This guy is willing
to kill an accomplice

15:14.988 --> 15:16.488
just to leave a clue as
to what might happen next!

15:16.490 --> 15:20.742
- Which could be anything!
- It's your watch, Jane!

15:20.794 --> 15:22.494
Excuse me. We're in the middle
of something here, all right?

15:22.496 --> 15:25.456
So is he.
Detective Jane Rizzoli,

15:25.457 --> 15:26.748
this is your bodyguard.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.751
- Boris Martin.
- Oh, come on!

15:29.803 --> 15:32.420
Normally, a cop's in danger,
I put them in protective custody.

15:32.472 --> 15:35.173
Whoever's targeting you ...
they're anticipating normal.

15:35.175 --> 15:38.226
The department is
paying for a bodyguard?!

15:38.261 --> 15:40.178
You have a bodyguard.
Focus on what's important.

15:40.180 --> 15:44.265
- Nice to meet you.
- Take her home, Mr. Martin.

15:48.188 --> 15:50.271
[Telephone rings]

15:50.323 --> 15:54.025
[Thud] 
Oh, come on!

15:54.077 --> 15:57.912
[Sighs] 
Really?

15:57.948 --> 16:01.332
[Elevator bell dings]

16:01.368 --> 16:03.001
Hi, Gary.

16:11.211 --> 16:14.295
Tell me about your living arrangements.

16:14.347 --> 16:20.768
I, uh, live with my brother.
It's temporary.

16:20.804 --> 16:24.939
Well, he'll have to move
till this is over. [Sighs]

16:24.975 --> 16:26.958
Finally, some good news.

16:29.112 --> 16:31.813
[Indistinct conversations]

16:31.865 --> 16:34.365
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:34.401 --> 16:38.203
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.

16:38.238 --> 16:41.823
Look, you don't have to
save Jane by yourself.

16:41.875 --> 16:45.326
You didn't have to
pay for that bodyguard.

16:45.378 --> 16:49.964
Tell me ... Tell me how the,
um, investigation's going.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.834
Well, I-I questioned every
resident in that halfway house,

16:52.886 --> 16:54.969
and it's just like the
scummy ex-boyfriend said.

16:55.005 --> 16:57.555
Lianne Sampson had a new
guy, but no one's seen him.

16:57.591 --> 16:59.591
He's a ghost, so dead end.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.291
Oh, a-and the balloons
that you pulled out

17:02.292 --> 17:03.261
- of Lianne's stomach...
- Mm-hmm?

17:03.263 --> 17:06.232
...are from a shoe store that
closed down eight years ago.

17:07.067 --> 17:10.018
[Sighs] I-I keep running
headfirst into a wall

17:10.069 --> 17:11.352
and hoping the wall gives.

17:11.404 --> 17:13.271
Well, you're doing
the best that you can.

17:13.323 --> 17:16.941
That's not enough.
He could still get to Jane.

17:16.992 --> 17:19.160
- No, he won't.
- Yeah, but he might.

17:19.194 --> 17:21.579
I have to figure out
something else to do,

17:21.615 --> 17:23.114
but I don't know what that is yet.

17:23.116 --> 17:25.042
[Sighs]
[sighs] I don't know.

17:25.078 --> 17:29.037
Maybe, um...
Maybe he's not a he.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.089
Maybe.

17:32.959 --> 17:36.261
Wait.
Yeah.

17:36.296 --> 17:39.180
If that's true, there's one
place I haven't checked yet.

17:39.215 --> 17:40.882
Thank you.

17:40.934 --> 17:44.228
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:47.641 --> 17:49.390
[Duct tape tears]

17:52.395 --> 17:54.479
What are you doing?

17:54.531 --> 17:57.231
Uh, I was just cleaning
out the room for you.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.984
Just one more trip, I should be done.

18:02.322 --> 18:06.157
- Thank you?
- I can protect you better in there.

18:06.159 --> 18:07.875
What, from light, from air?

18:07.911 --> 18:10.378
Someone is trying to disrupt
your normal patterns of behavior ...

18:10.413 --> 18:12.547
where you live, how
you spend, how you work.

18:12.582 --> 18:14.332
In this apartment,

18:14.384 --> 18:17.001
I can create a bulwark of
stability and predictability.

18:17.003 --> 18:20.922
- Huh, just what I've always wanted.
- This will pass.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.473
I'll make sure you're around
to achieve your dreams,

18:22.509 --> 18:24.342
whatever those are.

18:24.344 --> 18:27.145
- [Beep] Thanks. I appreciate that.
- What are you doing?

18:27.180 --> 18:30.181
I'm making my dreams
of a pizza a reality.

18:30.183 --> 18:34.435
- It was thwarted earlier today.
- No deliveries.

18:34.487 --> 18:36.321
[Cellphone thuds]

18:36.356 --> 18:38.940
- But I'm hungry.
- I'll cook.

18:38.992 --> 18:42.193
- Pizza?
- Dreams die hard.

18:51.121 --> 18:53.204
Frankie!

18:53.256 --> 18:56.207
- Hiya, son.
- Hey, Ma.

18:56.259 --> 18:59.210
- Mwah!
- Hey, I, uh... I got to go.

18:59.262 --> 19:03.047
- I thought your shift was over?
- Something came up.

19:03.049 --> 19:04.215
Something with Jane?

19:05.552 --> 19:09.220
- I can't talk about it.
- Whoa.

19:09.272 --> 19:12.056
- I do have a gun.
- So?

19:12.058 --> 19:16.310
Ma... someone's after
Jane, but it's okay.

19:16.363 --> 19:17.945
I'm on it. We're all on it.

19:17.981 --> 19:24.485
- You all right?
- Uh... Yeah.

19:24.537 --> 19:28.373
- Yeah, I-I'm okay.
- I gotta go.

19:31.661 --> 19:33.544
[Door opens]

19:41.004 --> 19:42.387
[Scoffs]

19:42.422 --> 19:44.005
There's nothing good in here.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.556
Don't read the front page. 
Go to sports.

19:45.592 --> 19:49.227
I started with sports.
How's the pizza coming?

19:49.262 --> 19:51.145
It's been over 15 minutes.
It should be free.

19:51.181 --> 19:55.099
Grilled Moroccan chicken.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.020
[Sniffs]

19:59.072 --> 20:00.438
It smells like angels.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.573
I hope you like it.
It was simple, really.

20:02.609 --> 20:04.025
I found a chicken breast in the fridge

20:04.077 --> 20:06.527
and combined some
spices from the pantry.

20:06.579 --> 20:10.665
Mmm!
It tastes like...

20:10.700 --> 20:12.417
I don't want to say that
I would eat an angel.

20:12.452 --> 20:14.535
But if it tasted like this,
I could live with myself.

20:14.587 --> 20:15.753
Thank you!

20:15.789 --> 20:18.206
You're welcome.
I love to cook.

20:18.258 --> 20:21.342
This job is so unpredictable
... the hours, the personalities.

20:21.377 --> 20:23.461
I like the measured
predictability of cooking.

20:23.463 --> 20:25.713
I like it, too ... very much.

20:25.765 --> 20:27.298
<i>[Knock on door]

<i>- Jane?
- Who is it?</i>

20:33.723 --> 20:37.442
[Whispers] It's my mother.

Who are you?!</i>

I can't protect you.

<i>Open up!</i>

20:45.785 --> 20:49.487
Hi. Come on in.
I'm Boris, a work friend of Jane's.

20:49.489 --> 20:53.207
Hi. Angela Rizzoli.
Nice to meet ya.

20:53.243 --> 20:55.293
- Hi, Ma!
- Hi. [Lock turns]

20:55.328 --> 20:57.662
I know you got that work thing going on,

20:57.714 --> 21:00.164
so I just came to drop this off.

21:00.166 --> 21:03.501
- I thought you might be hungry.
- Yes! We are.

21:03.503 --> 21:06.471
- Thank you.
- It smells fantastic.

21:06.506 --> 21:08.840
Lasagna ... my mother's recipe.

21:08.892 --> 21:13.728
It'll make that six-pack into a five.
[Nervous laughter]

21:13.763 --> 21:16.597
- I'm in. I like her.
- Oh, I-I do, too.

21:19.519 --> 21:22.854
Ah, so, I-I'm sure you ...
you have a few questions.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.522
About what?

21:24.524 --> 21:27.909
Oh, about that secret
work-operation thing?

21:27.944 --> 21:31.529
N-No, I've learned
it's none of my business.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.758
R-Really?
Well, um, 'cause ...

21:34.793 --> 21:38.536
- 'cause, you know, everything's fine.
- Oh, well, I figured.

21:39.789 --> 21:42.507
Oh. Yeah, um, you good?

21:42.542 --> 21:44.425
- Good.
- She's good?

21:44.460 --> 21:46.928
- Great.
- Everything's good!

21:46.963 --> 21:51.049
Okay, so, you can put that in the fridge
and heat that up later, and

21:51.050 --> 21:52.383
- [clears throat] Jane?
- Hmm?

21:52.435 --> 21:55.386
It'll go very nicely with
a glass of red wine...

21:55.438 --> 21:58.723
- [whispers] and don't forget the napkins.
- Yes, ma'am.

- Yeah.

though, isn't she?

- Yes, she is.
- Uh-huh. [Sighs]

22:41.901 --> 22:42.850

- What was the question?

<i>How is this you staying
out of the investigation?</i>

never to come back again.

- And w-what?

35:20.519 --> 35:23.603
He's taken everything.
There's nothing left to take.

35:23.638 --> 35:26.890
You're safe here, Jane.
No one's gonna get to you.

35:32.731 --> 35:35.982
The watch.
[Beep]

35:36.034 --> 35:37.734
Uh, the watch...

35:37.736 --> 35:40.870
watch was a gift. On the back of it...

35:40.906 --> 35:43.623
Was engraved "love, Ma."

35:44.993 --> 35:47.710
- It's going to voicemail. [Beep]
- I'll call the Dirty Robber.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.079

Hey, Janie, I'm glad you called.

36:04.012 --> 36:05.979
- Ma's the target!
- What?

36:06.014 --> 36:09.933
- Get to the Dirty Robber!
- I-I'm here. She went home already.

36:09.985 --> 36:12.101
Okay, um [sighs] uh,

36:12.103 --> 36:13.820
go to Maura's house, but take
the route that she would take.

36:13.855 --> 36:17.857
<i>And if you see her, stop
her and stay with her. [Beep]</i>

36:17.909 --> 36:19.659
[Elevator bell dings] Ma, it's me.
Call me when you get this.

36:19.694 --> 36:21.244
[Beep] We got to get to Maura's.
He's after Ma.

36:21.279 --> 36:23.112
- How do you know?
- Uh, 5:26 is a ...

36:23.164 --> 36:24.998
it's a Bible verse
about taking everything.

36:25.033 --> 36:28.001
And what if you reverse it?
26-526.

36:28.036 --> 36:31.205
That's the penal code for kidnapping.

[Door opens]

37:38.907 --> 37:40.773
Ma?

37:47.848 --> 37:50.766
Ma?
[Clatter]

37:50.818 --> 37:54.820
- Oh, my!
- It's okay! It's okay! It's me!

37:54.855 --> 37:56.071
[Both breathing heavily]

37:57.775 --> 38:00.693
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

38:00.745 --> 38:02.277
You almost gave me a heart attack!

38:02.330 --> 38:05.914
- I've been calling you!
- I was running a bath!

38:05.950 --> 38:07.533
[Sighs]

38:07.535 --> 38:09.535
What is going on?

[Sighs]

38:13.290 --> 38:16.675
- Somebody's been harassing me.
- Yeah.

38:16.711 --> 38:19.428
- Yeah, I-I know.
- What do you know?

38:19.463 --> 38:21.380
- Frankie told me.
-  Okay, you know what?!

38:21.432 --> 38:24.683
- He shouldn't have done that, Ma!
- No, he had every right.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.685
He was worried, and...
[inhales deeply]

38:26.721 --> 38:29.688
well, we were worried.
[Sighs]

38:29.724 --> 38:32.891
Why are you here with a gun?
[Sighs]

38:32.893 --> 38:36.862
Okay, because the ... 
the watch that...

38:36.897 --> 38:39.331
[Voice breaking] 
that you gave me...

38:39.367 --> 38:43.068
when I made Junior Cadet [sighs]
it was [sighs]

38:43.120 --> 38:45.070

- What?

38:45.122 --> 38:46.822
It doesn't matter. I just...

38:46.874 --> 38:49.658
I just needed to see you just
to make sure that you're okay.

38:49.710 --> 38:53.462
I'm okay.
Janie, I'm okay.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.464
- Okay...
- Come on, baby.

38:55.499 --> 38:57.332
Oh!

38:57.385 --> 39:00.335
- Okay, ow.
- Okay. [Sniffles]

39:00.388 --> 39:03.472
- Ah, you just made me deaf.
- [Sighs] I'm sorry.

39:03.507 --> 39:08.394
Oh. [Sighs]
Janie, you're under a lot of stress.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.978
[Sighing] Yeah.
 [Breathes raggedly]

39:10.014 --> 39:12.731
All right. Breathe.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.983
Okay. 
[Sighs] Okay.

39:15.019 --> 39:18.232
I'm gonna go make us some tea, okay?
Come on. Come on.

39:49.437 --> 39:52.938
So, what, your new motto
now is to protect and scare?!

39:52.973 --> 39:56.525
- Sorry, Angela, I ...
- You all need to calm down!

39:56.560 --> 39:59.645
I'm gonna make a big
pot of chamomile tea!

39:59.697 --> 40:02.614
Could you make it in a scotch glass?

40:02.650 --> 40:03.982
[Sighs]

40:04.034 --> 40:05.651
Anything you want.

40:05.703 --> 40:08.654
Well, if you're already making
it in the scotch glass...

40:08.656 --> 40:09.988
[Chuckles]

40:09.990 --> 40:12.157
Okay, but I'm counting this
is on the clock.

40:12.159 --> 40:14.877
Fair enough.

[Police radio chatter]

40:22.169 --> 40:25.003

Yes, sir!

- Maura.

40:57.087 --> 40:59.705
- She was at the office, right?
- I think so.

She's not answering.
