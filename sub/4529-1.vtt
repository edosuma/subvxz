WEBVTT

01:51.028 --> 01:53.905
'It began with a storm in June.

01:55.491 --> 01:57.825
'In the days before,
German bombs had fallen

01:57.951 --> 02:00.953
'on the outskirts of Paris
for the first time.

02:02.331 --> 02:05.625
'Terrified people were fleeing the city
any way they could.

02:07.336 --> 02:11.088
'But deep in the countryside
the war still felt far away

02:11.215 --> 02:12.715
'and I remained preoccupied

02:12.841 --> 02:16.677
'with the one I was already fighting
much closer to home.'

02:17.638 --> 02:19.388
Are you not dressed yet?

02:20.307 --> 02:21.641
We'll be late.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.353
Do you really think
we should go out today?

02:26.146 --> 02:27.188
Why ever not?

02:47.376 --> 02:50.086
'My mother-in-law,
Madame Angellier,

02:50.212 --> 02:52.547
'refused to accept
the prospect of defeat,

02:53.382 --> 02:57.385
'even as the first refugees from Paris
started to arrive.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.685
'Three years before I'd married
her precious son at my father's insistence

03:05.811 --> 03:07.645
'and moved to Bussy.

03:09.565 --> 03:14.735
'With Gaston away fighting, she felt
I should learn how to run his properties.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.363
'So every month we visited our tenants,

03:17.489 --> 03:20.741
'on a Sunday because Madame knew
the farmers would be home.'

03:20.868 --> 03:25.204
Don't make any noise.
That way you see how they really live.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.498
'She liked to catch them out.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.836
'I hated every minute of it.'

03:44.600 --> 03:46.517
Have you heard anything
from your son?

03:46.643 --> 03:50.730
No, not for over a week.
And you?

03:50.856 --> 03:53.107
No, nothing from either of our boys.

03:53.233 --> 03:57.361
- People say Paris is going to fall.
- People say a lot of things.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.948
Lucile?

04:02.951 --> 04:04.201
Madame, it's...

04:04.328 --> 04:06.120
It's a big farm.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.332
And it's been difficult
without my brothers.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.959
We'll put what they owe us
down to next month.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.586
If I make any exceptions,

04:13.712 --> 04:16.464
then Gaston wouldn't have
a home of his own to return to,

04:17.048 --> 04:20.216
and then what would
he have been fighting for?

04:22.304 --> 04:24.764
Come along, Lucile.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.223
Good morning.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.186
They don't want to pay the rent
but they don't think twice

04:30.312 --> 04:32.813
about buying silk stockings
for that daughter of theirs.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.649
Did you see?

04:35.567 --> 04:38.069
I know it seems harsh,
but if you show them any weakness,

04:38.195 --> 04:39.612
they'll bleed you dry.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.199
When Gaston comes home,
he'll see he has a wife

04:43.325 --> 04:45.159
who knows what it is
to be a land...

04:45.285 --> 04:47.828
Stop! Stop the car!

04:56.505 --> 04:58.923
- We should turn back.
- No.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.221
We've got potatoes to buy
and four more rents to collect.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.974
Madman.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.983
The sack looks heavy.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.110
He can manage.

05:19.945 --> 05:23.155
- How much do we owe you?
- Four francs.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.123
Thank you.

05:32.249 --> 05:36.544
There are more cars on the road,
from Paris.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.463
My father always said,

05:39.589 --> 05:41.841
"If you want to see what people
are truly made of, you start a war."

05:58.942 --> 06:01.277
Oh, what is this?

06:33.685 --> 06:35.686
Go and see how long it goes on for.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.190
Keep up.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.735
Keep up.

06:45.489 --> 06:46.822
Excuse me, Madame.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.908
I wouldn't ask for me,
but my wife's very tired.

06:49.034 --> 06:52.453
We've walked all the way from Paris.
Could she rest in your car?

06:52.579 --> 06:54.914
Yes. Yes, yes, of course.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.207
Thanks.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.960
Oh, Lord.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.635
- Are those ours?
- Theirs, always theirs.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.115
Get down!

07:37.374 --> 07:38.666
Anna!

08:12.659 --> 08:15.077
Anna? Anna?

08:24.754 --> 08:27.673
- Thank you.
- Lucile.

08:27.799 --> 08:30.551
We need to get off the road.
Could you take us to the nearest town?

08:37.683 --> 08:39.684
Hey, you!

08:40.979 --> 08:42.938
Get away from my car!

08:50.113 --> 08:52.615
Lucile! Get in the car!

08:59.956 --> 09:03.375
When I tell you to do something,
you damn well do it.

09:11.468 --> 09:12.509
Children.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.436
'So this was war.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.981
'Paris had suddenly descended on Bussy.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.776
The whole town's been cleaned out.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.738
'Women and children escaping the bombs,
looking for food and shelter.'

09:32.864 --> 09:34.031
Can I get you some water?

09:34.157 --> 09:35.824
'But the enemy had followed them here.'

09:36.451 --> 09:38.160
Move, move!

09:38.286 --> 09:41.163
Madame Perrin,
It's Lucile Angellier, Gaston's wife.

09:41.289 --> 09:45.751
Get out of the damn way.
You've got to leave, they're coming.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.664
'Fear had seized the town.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.792
'Rumours spread that a regiment
was heading to Bussy.

11:08.918 --> 11:12.546
'I left only the bare essentials
in Gaston's office.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.174
'Madame Angellier would rather
see his things burn

11:15.300 --> 11:17.593
'than in the hands
of one of their soldiers.'

11:25.560 --> 11:28.187
Brethren of Bussy,

11:28.313 --> 11:31.815
a great tragedy
has befallen our nation.

11:31.941 --> 11:36.862
Millions have fled their homes,
many thousands have lost their lives,

11:37.030 --> 11:40.949
and the fate of a whole generation
of brave young men

11:41.076 --> 11:43.535
still remains unknown.

11:45.372 --> 11:49.124
Only God knows
what's in store for all of us

11:49.250 --> 11:54.004
and the country
that we can no longer call our own.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.632
We must hold firm together.

11:56.758 --> 12:01.261
We must put aside anything
that will divide us from our neighbour.

12:01.388 --> 12:07.267
We must unite into one being,
one family under God.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.021
They're here already.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.607
Let us pray.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.112
- Anna, stand up.
- Our Father who art in heaven,

12:18.238 --> 12:19.446
hallowed be thy name.

12:19.572 --> 12:23.492
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

12:23.618 --> 12:26.870
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

12:26.996 --> 12:29.957
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.544
Lead us not into temptation
and deliver us from evil.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.504
Amen.

13:32.395 --> 13:37.399
Under the authority
and the signature of Maréchal Pétain,

13:37.525 --> 13:40.569
a new constitution
of the French state is signed,

13:41.321 --> 13:47.659
guaranteeing the rights of labour,
of family and of the fatherland.

13:47.785 --> 13:51.538
You are defeated
and we are now in charge.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.708
All firearms must be surrendered

13:54.834 --> 13:57.794
to German headquarters
tomorrow morning.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.756
As our Führer writes,

14:00.924 --> 14:04.468
"The sword will become our plough
and from the tears of war..."

14:04.594 --> 14:06.345
- How long will they be here?
- I don't know.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.680
"...the daily bread
of future generations will grow."

14:08.806 --> 14:11.183
But I'm damned
if I'm living by German time.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.770
Those who have been billeted an officer

14:14.896 --> 14:19.691
should return home
and prepare for their arrival.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.835
We don't look at him.
We don't speak to him.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.554
Guten Tag.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.223
Madame.

14:59.190 --> 15:04.236
Madame Angellier,
I'm Oberleutnant Bruno von Falk.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.947
You have been told to expect me?

15:10.660 --> 15:12.411
Madame.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.788
I will try not to inconvenience you.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.333
I only require a room
and somewhere to work.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.546
Excuse me.

15:22.672 --> 15:25.841
I hope you don't mind,
but I can't be late.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.311
Er...

15:37.437 --> 15:39.938
They didn't say anything about a dog.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.578
May the Lord bless
these gifts we are about to receive.

15:54.704 --> 15:58.457
May he bless those who are unable
to share his bounty with us.

16:00.251 --> 16:04.546
Guide them from danger,
keep them safe.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.506
- Amen.
- Amen.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.078
Madame.

16:36.204 --> 16:41.625
May I kindly request the key
to the piano and the desk?

16:44.045 --> 16:47.756
I give you my word that they will be treated
with the utmost care.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.760
Marthe will give you the key.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.721
Good evening.

17:00.478 --> 17:03.689
He'll be playing "Deutschland Über Alles"
before we know it.

17:50.445 --> 17:52.779
Did you find somewhere to stay?

17:52.947 --> 17:55.782
Yes, thank you.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.081
Have you seen this one?

18:11.382 --> 18:15.385
We have to take German money.
We can't go out after nine.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.598
And God help you if you're found
listening to De Gaulle on the radio.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.062
Have you got anyone?

18:26.189 --> 18:28.648
- An officer.
- Oh.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.611
That's the price you pay for having
the best house in the village, I suppose.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.614
And you?

18:35.740 --> 18:38.074
Hm... nobody.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.369
The only benefit of having the worst.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.423
Why does she look at me like that?

18:53.508 --> 18:55.008
You don't know?

18:56.469 --> 19:00.972
Your mother-in-law moved her
and her parents into a barn.

19:01.098 --> 19:06.436
Then she put a refugee from Paris
into their home and doubled the rent.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.030
Nächste.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.494
Name, occupation, address?

19:22.620 --> 19:27.290
Benoit Labarie, farmer,
the Montmort estate.

19:32.755 --> 19:33.797
Nächste.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.511
Name, occupation, address?

19:46.644 --> 19:48.687
- Viscountess.
- Benoit.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.021
- Viscount.
- Excuse me.

19:50.147 --> 19:53.066
Your wife and children were
in church yesterday. Where were you?

19:53.192 --> 19:57.487
Working, not that you'd know
anything about that.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.451
Benoit, please be careful
what you say to them.

20:03.578 --> 20:07.664
We've been their tenants for generations.
They never give us anything but grief.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.990
Entschuldigung.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.161
- Bitte.
- Danke.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.086
Get inside, girls.

21:38.214 --> 21:42.300
We'll have to get used to it, I'm afraid,
along with everything else.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.761
'There had been no men
in our town for so long.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.639
'The mothers of French soldiers
looked on with disgust

21:47.765 --> 21:49.391
'and begged God to curse them.'

21:49.517 --> 21:50.558
Can I help you?

21:50.685 --> 21:52.352
'But the young women just looked.'

21:52.478 --> 21:54.229
You are beautiful.
What is your name?

21:54.355 --> 21:56.356
Celine.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.024
C-E-L-I-N-E.

21:58.150 --> 22:02.696
Celine, could I have
a word with you, please?

22:05.908 --> 22:08.118
Can I carry those bags for you?

22:09.453 --> 22:11.287
I'm going that way anyway.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.165
You can say, "No, thank you."

22:26.303 --> 22:29.305
Oh, that's not for in here.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.184
You're not going to like this.

22:36.105 --> 22:39.941
If it makes you feel any better,
everybody who can afford to is doing it.

22:44.572 --> 22:48.074
'My mother-in-law pretended
we were united in war,

22:48.200 --> 22:50.368
'but the well-off continued
to reap their own wheat

22:50.494 --> 22:54.164
'and count their own money
and to hell with everyone else.

22:54.290 --> 22:57.042
'Others, like Benoit and Madeleine,
wouldn't have hoarded

22:57.168 --> 22:58.668
'even if they'd had the chance.'

23:02.506 --> 23:04.215
This is for you.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.634
It's just, we have food to spare.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.596
If you know what I mean.

23:19.106 --> 23:22.609
You must miss Gaston,
miss having someone else to talk to.

23:22.735 --> 23:23.985
Mm.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.320
Yes, I do.

23:27.198 --> 23:29.032
Do you write to him?

23:29.909 --> 23:31.493
We don't know where he is.

23:31.619 --> 23:35.914
Well, you should write anyway.
Make you feel better.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.458
Benoit would do anything
to swap places with Gaston,

23:39.043 --> 23:41.044
to have fought like a man.

23:41.212 --> 23:42.420
Really?

23:42.546 --> 23:44.380
Yeah. If you don't believe me,
you can ask him yourself.

23:44.507 --> 23:47.175
Oh.

23:47.885 --> 23:48.968
Ssh...

24:05.069 --> 24:08.696
Ssh... Oh.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.370
- Can we help you?
- Mesdames.

24:15.496 --> 24:20.750
There has been a change of plan.
I have been billeted with you.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.545
I apologise for the inconvenience.

24:23.671 --> 24:26.756
But they said that we were too far
from the village to have anyone.

24:26.882 --> 24:30.301
I was surprised myself.
I was staying at the chateau.

24:30.427 --> 24:33.805
- You're an officer?
- A lieutenant.

24:33.931 --> 24:36.599
But this is just a farmhouse.
The rooms won't be good enough.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.644
- We haven't even got any running water.
- Ssh-ssh-ssh.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.771
You needn't worry about me.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.776
This will do nicely.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.285
Here. Ssh...

25:02.042 --> 25:07.005
'This young officer relished his power
to disrupt Benoit and Madeleine's lives,

25:07.131 --> 25:10.550
'as if their lives
weren't difficult enough already.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.805
'And what about our soldier?

25:17.558 --> 25:20.059
'Every night I heard him.

25:20.853 --> 25:24.272
'Always the same unfamiliar music.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.399
'I was meant to resent him,

25:26.525 --> 25:30.111
'yet there was relief in his presence
after months of silence.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.359
Bubi.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.615
Sorry to disturb you.

26:18.827 --> 26:22.247
The dog isn't mine.
We found him in an abandoned village.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.584
At least he's a Frenchman.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.300
May I?

26:42.184 --> 26:44.519
Your house is beautiful, Madame.

26:46.230 --> 26:49.399
It isn't mine.
It's my mother-in-law's.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.026
The piano is yours, I imagine.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.863
And what makes you say that?

26:56.782 --> 26:59.325
I don't believe
your mother-in-law is a music lover.

27:01.912 --> 27:04.747
My father gave that piano to me.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.624
Do you play?

27:06.750 --> 27:08.251
I do.

27:11.171 --> 27:13.006
But Madame doesn't want
any music in the house

27:13.132 --> 27:15.550
until my husband's home to hear it.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.059
Do you mind if I sit?

27:28.063 --> 27:30.398
The piece you keep playing...

27:32.067 --> 27:35.570
- I don't recognise it.
- You wouldn't.

27:35.696 --> 27:38.197
- I've studied music, you know.
- Not this.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.160
You wrote it.

27:44.079 --> 27:48.041
I was a composer before the war,
when I first got married.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.627
- You're married?
- I've been married four years.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.589
And a soldier four years.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.218
She must miss you.

28:00.929 --> 28:05.266
No, not really, not anymore.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.120
Hello?

28:59.655 --> 29:03.241
Schätzchen, come here.

29:24.263 --> 29:25.721
Bubi, here.

29:31.270 --> 29:35.106
- What are you doing here?
- I thought I'd left something.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.400
So you come in without asking?

29:39.236 --> 29:40.736
I can't hear you.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.323
I'm sorry.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.203
- Did you look at any of these?
- No.

29:49.329 --> 29:50.997
- No?
- No, I promise.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.082
Read one.

29:57.004 --> 29:58.504
Out loud.

30:00.632 --> 30:04.010
"To whom it may concern, Monsieur Blanc
is a married father of five children.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.554
"For several months he has had...

30:11.685 --> 30:15.771
"...sexual relations
with a young woman half his age.

30:15.898 --> 30:18.733
"He should be charged
with public indecency."

30:18.859 --> 30:21.277
"Monsieur Dubois is trading food
on the black market.

30:21.403 --> 30:24.322
"Monsieur Acar is a communist,
a liar and a homosexual.

30:24.448 --> 30:27.033
"The refugee at mass
pretends to be a Catholic

30:27.159 --> 30:29.452
"when she really is a dirty Jew."

30:29.578 --> 30:30.995
What are they?

30:31.622 --> 30:33.789
They are from your neighbours.

30:33.916 --> 30:36.000
They were waiting for us
at the town hall when we arrived.

30:36.126 --> 30:38.794
They're gossip.

30:38.921 --> 30:42.256
Nothing more.
They are just people settling old scores.

30:42.382 --> 30:46.469
- Er... they should be burned.
- If I had my way, they would.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.514
My Major has ordered me.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.352
It is my job to read them.
You can go.

31:15.958 --> 31:17.750
I don't know
why you ever married him.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.503
Was it the land?

31:20.629 --> 31:24.715
Your father lost all of his
so he sent you looking for someone else's.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.342
No.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.303
My father was dying.

31:30.597 --> 31:33.432
He wanted to... find me a... good man.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.226
A rich man.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.229
What have I done?

31:40.899 --> 31:43.609
I see everything
that goes on in this house.

31:45.529 --> 31:47.655
Please, he only asked
to go into the garden.

31:47.781 --> 31:49.532
You should have stood up and left.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.450
Do you expect me
to be confined to my bedroom?

31:51.618 --> 31:55.913
- I expect you to be a faithful wife.
- I am.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.790
Then how can you speak,
how can you even breathe,

31:57.916 --> 32:00.459
when you know that your husband
has been hunted down

32:00.586 --> 32:01.919
by these animals?

32:02.045 --> 32:06.048
When I see them,
I want to rip their eyes out.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.178
What's happened?

32:13.098 --> 32:15.349
We've just heard that...

32:16.768 --> 32:19.770
...Gaston's unit is
in a labour camp in Germany.

32:20.564 --> 32:24.650
Your husband is a prisoner of war.

32:24.776 --> 32:30.489
This German is our enemy.
Do you understand?

32:32.659 --> 32:33.701
Yes.

32:39.374 --> 32:40.875
Madame.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.961
I can't talk to you.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.635
I should have believed you.

32:50.761 --> 32:53.763
I think this is why
you came into my room.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.476
I'm sorry.

33:49.653 --> 33:52.446
Remember you're doing
the rents today, Lucile.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.032
Come on, Marthe.
We're going to be late.

34:38.452 --> 34:40.369
I'm going for a swim.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.663
Can you swim?

34:44.331 --> 34:47.208
The Viscount doesn't let the villagers
swim in the lake.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.295
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean...

34:49.420 --> 34:52.089
I meant with your infirmity,
can you...?

34:53.550 --> 34:55.259
What happened?

34:56.094 --> 35:00.097
My horse fell.
My leg was trapped.

35:02.017 --> 35:04.977
Otherwise you would have fought, huh?

35:05.103 --> 35:07.688
Yes, I would.

35:07.814 --> 35:12.485
Nietzsche said
a man is made to be a warrior.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.111
Have you read Nietzsche?

35:17.324 --> 35:19.116
He also said...

35:20.202 --> 35:23.788
...a woman is made
to please the warrior.

35:27.167 --> 35:32.338
His leg, did it happen
before or after you were married?

35:34.174 --> 35:35.216
After.

35:41.014 --> 35:43.474
Beautiful scent.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.852
Perhaps I could buy a bouquet
for my bedroom,

35:46.978 --> 35:48.562
cheer it up a little.

35:48.688 --> 35:52.107
Madeleine... we've got
to bring the animals in.

35:52.234 --> 35:57.196
Hey, a vase by my bed,
if that's no trouble.

36:32.107 --> 36:34.483
It's all there, Madame Angellier.

36:34.609 --> 36:37.361
You'll get double that next-door now.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.628
I learned that piece
when I was young.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.965
My father taught it to me.

36:59.342 --> 37:03.971
- Anna's father taught her too.
- Oh! Is he...?

37:04.097 --> 37:07.933
He and my other daughter
got separated from us.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.310
But, er...

37:09.436 --> 37:12.062
But they'll be joining us soon, hm?

37:14.065 --> 37:16.650
That's enough practice for today.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.445
Why don't you go outside and play?

37:22.407 --> 37:25.159
Stay close to the house.

37:27.621 --> 37:30.372
- She's lovely.
- Thank you.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.199
Danke schön.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.639
I'm sorry.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.644
It's just hard
with them living so close to us.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.707
Fuck you.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.796
Fuck you.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.633
Was?

40:14.704 --> 40:16.080
Benoit!

40:16.206 --> 40:17.456
Please.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.126
I thought you'd handed in your gun.

40:21.252 --> 40:24.838
I did, the one that was registered.

40:24.964 --> 40:28.634
- People have been killed for less.
- I need it.

40:28.802 --> 40:31.178
Why don't you tell her
why you're here?

40:31.304 --> 40:34.556
The German... in my home,

40:34.682 --> 40:36.767
he's chasing after Madeleine.

40:39.896 --> 40:42.231
The officer that lives here
could put pressure on him.

40:42.357 --> 40:44.775
- I don't speak to him.
- That's not what I've heard.

40:47.487 --> 40:51.657
I'm not here to criticise you.
I just want him moved.

40:53.576 --> 40:55.077
Please.

41:03.002 --> 41:05.295
You have a complaint
about a German soldier?

41:05.380 --> 41:08.465
- I apologise.
- So you'll do something?

41:09.551 --> 41:13.053
I have no influence over him.
We are of equal rank.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.680
So it's one rule for us
and another for them?

41:14.806 --> 41:16.807
That's not what I said.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.018
We lost the war. We don't have
to lose our women as well.

41:20.145 --> 41:24.815
Then perhaps you should have thought
of protecting them earlier, my friend.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.027
Please.

41:32.866 --> 41:34.283
I will try.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.078
But it might only make it worse.

41:38.204 --> 41:40.747
Tell him to leave her in peace.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.876
I won't ask again.

42:00.894 --> 42:02.728
Our regiment could leave at any time.

42:04.814 --> 42:09.484
I couldn't stand to think...
that you hated me.

42:09.611 --> 42:12.112
I don't hate you.

42:13.448 --> 42:15.699
Then invite me for tea.

42:17.452 --> 42:21.538
There's hardly any left.
Your men have taken it all.

42:21.664 --> 42:24.041
Or wine.

42:24.167 --> 42:26.335
I'll talk to Bonnet,

42:26.461 --> 42:30.797
but in return I only ask
that we be decent to one another.

42:33.176 --> 42:35.302
Where's the harm in that?

42:35.428 --> 42:38.680
My mother-in-law
would throw me out.

42:38.806 --> 42:40.474
I've got nowhere else to go.

42:40.600 --> 42:44.603
She has church tonight.
She'll be another half an hour.

42:46.314 --> 42:48.065
Just one drink.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.661
How did you become a soldier?

43:01.996 --> 43:05.540
I'm from a military family.
It was expected of us.

43:06.709 --> 43:09.753
My brothers and I signed up
on the same day.

43:09.879 --> 43:13.465
Your brothers, where are they?

43:13.591 --> 43:15.759
One was killed in Poland.

43:17.053 --> 43:18.971
Another one in Normandy.

43:19.097 --> 43:23.433
The youngest has just left for Africa.

43:23.559 --> 43:26.561
People shouldn't be sacrificed like this.

43:28.314 --> 43:31.483
- I mean none of us.
- I can't think like that.

43:33.444 --> 43:37.114
Questioning only makes things
more difficult.

43:37.240 --> 43:38.740
Do you believe in the war?

43:40.410 --> 43:43.245
Let's say I believe
in the communal spirit.

43:44.122 --> 43:46.123
None of us like to admit it,

43:46.291 --> 43:50.294
but single actions on their own
don't mean anything.

43:50.837 --> 43:53.964
So why is it that whenever I see you
you're always on your own?

43:55.675 --> 43:57.426
When do you see me?

44:24.912 --> 44:29.166
Forget all this for two minutes.
Come on.

45:11.125 --> 45:12.459
Lucile.

45:14.420 --> 45:18.215
Madame is on her way back.
Go into the garden.

45:18.341 --> 45:19.591
Quickly!

45:30.603 --> 45:34.648
I'm supposed
to be the one everyone's afraid of

45:34.774 --> 45:37.234
but she could easily scare
the plague away.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.861
Why are all these lights
left on?

45:39.987 --> 45:45.158
I just wanted to thank you.
You were very kind.

45:45.243 --> 45:49.121
It's been a long time
since I talked to anyone like this.

45:50.623 --> 45:52.124
I thank you.

45:59.340 --> 46:01.174
Gute Nacht.

47:24.050 --> 47:25.550
Lucile!

47:25.676 --> 47:28.178
Well, I suppose
you'll tell everyone now.

47:28.304 --> 47:32.224
Oh, it's all right for you.
All I do is work.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.518
If I didn't have love, I...

47:34.644 --> 47:36.811
I don't care where he was born.

47:36.938 --> 47:38.855
They're human, just like us.

47:38.981 --> 47:42.609
And they didn't throw my family
out of their home. You did that.

47:42.735 --> 47:46.488
That was my mother-in-law.
It's not me.

47:46.614 --> 47:49.115
Open your eyes, Lucile.

47:49.242 --> 47:52.786
Our men are no better than them.
Some of them are much worse.

47:52.912 --> 47:55.247
Ask your officer. He knows.

47:55.373 --> 47:58.625
Ask him what he's read
in those letters.

47:58.751 --> 48:02.087
Ask him what he's read
about your husband.

48:02.213 --> 48:04.881
You need to know.
Everybody else does.

48:54.599 --> 48:56.099
Danke.

50:03.626 --> 50:06.294
How long have you known?

50:06.420 --> 50:08.922
I didn't feel entitled to tell you.

50:09.048 --> 50:10.882
Lucile?

50:13.094 --> 50:14.761
You knew, didn't you?

50:14.887 --> 50:17.389
That your perfect son
has been having an affair

50:17.515 --> 50:19.349
that was going on
before we even met.

50:21.394 --> 50:23.478
You should see
how many of those are about you.

50:30.111 --> 50:33.613
You always say
how much you want a grandchild.

50:33.781 --> 50:36.783
Now you've got one.
Her name's Simone.

50:42.415 --> 50:47.085
You can keep your stupid little secrets.
I couldn't care less.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.441
Can I play you something?

52:32.566 --> 52:34.609
It's very beautiful.

52:40.825 --> 52:42.325
What is it?

52:44.495 --> 52:47.997
I married a man I'd only met twice.

52:48.123 --> 52:51.793
I tried to convince myself
that we were in love.

52:55.381 --> 52:57.966
I might as well have been dead.

53:15.526 --> 53:17.360
It's not possible.

53:30.499 --> 53:31.833
Lucile?

53:32.543 --> 53:33.960
I'm coming.

53:38.716 --> 53:41.134
Madame wants to see you
straight away.

53:41.719 --> 53:43.553
You remember Madame Perrin?

53:45.681 --> 53:46.931
Yes, of course.

53:50.227 --> 53:53.229
What brings you back
from the Free Zone, Madame?

53:53.355 --> 53:56.649
My son died in Normandy
as the Germans advanced.

53:56.734 --> 53:59.444
I've just received permission
to visit his grave.

53:59.570 --> 54:00.904
I'm sorry to hear.

54:01.030 --> 54:02.906
How are things in Lyon?

54:03.032 --> 54:04.073
Bad.

54:04.199 --> 54:06.242
At least you don't have a German
living in your house.

54:06.744 --> 54:08.328
Yes.

54:08.454 --> 54:11.289
I heard about your officer.
He's friendly?

54:11.457 --> 54:14.709
Well, I won't have anything to do
with him, but Lucile does, don't you?

54:15.669 --> 54:17.503
Oh, but that's good.

54:17.630 --> 54:21.799
We had to leave in such a hurry
that certain things were left behind.

54:21.926 --> 54:24.177
The Germans are using our house now.

54:24.303 --> 54:26.679
Could you go there
and get them back?

55:13.852 --> 55:17.230
So this is what it means
to be protected by the German army?

55:24.405 --> 55:25.822
Lucile.

55:27.241 --> 55:28.658
Wait.

55:28.784 --> 55:30.201
Look at me.

55:34.748 --> 55:38.042
What happens in there
is indefensible.

55:38.168 --> 55:40.503
I have nothing in common
with these people.

55:51.640 --> 55:55.309
The only person
I've something in common with...

55:58.105 --> 55:59.147
...is you.

55:59.773 --> 56:01.399
No.

56:28.886 --> 56:32.638
'A set of false teeth,
a china dinner service,

56:32.765 --> 56:37.185
'household items
of purely sentimental value.

56:37.311 --> 56:41.314
'I'd clawed back what crumbs I could
from the enemy.

56:45.027 --> 56:47.445
'The air was thick with whispers.

56:47.571 --> 56:50.364
'Some saw me as a collaborator.

56:50.491 --> 56:53.117
'Others admired my bravery.

56:53.243 --> 56:56.871
'But none knew
what I was really feeling.'

56:56.955 --> 56:58.956
Most of it is here.

56:59.875 --> 57:02.794
I apologise for any damages.

57:12.346 --> 57:13.846
Well done.

57:13.972 --> 57:17.975
At least you've got the nerve
to stand up to these scum.

58:59.411 --> 59:01.495
Marthe, can you take
these bags upstairs, please?

59:01.622 --> 59:04.582
On Thursday
she's going to visit her sister.

59:04.750 --> 59:08.002
- We'd have the house to ourselves.
- All right.

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:22.243
Come back here.
Come back here!

01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:25.705
Benoit Labarie!

01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:29.083
So you're the one
who's been stealing from us.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:30.376
You thief.

01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:36.132
What do you expect us to do?
You traitors would see us starve.

01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:38.092
How dare you speak to me like that?

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:40.886
I'll speak to you how I like.

01:00:44.433 --> 01:00:46.100
I'm not the only one who comes here.

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:50.313
We all do,
and it's only going to get worse.

01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:53.441
- Get out of here.
- Chickens.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:00.031
- Give me my fucking chickens!
- Please...

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:04.660
You'd better pray
your German friends stay a long time,

01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:07.038
because the day they leave...

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:12.585
I caught him.

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:14.170
It's Labarie.

01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:17.798
- I told you to let it lie.
- He still has a gun.

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:21.635
So does half the town,
including myself.

01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:27.975
He tried to shoot me with it.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.733
You need to do something.

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:24.824
Offizier Bonnet?

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:56.939
'For three months
we had lived alongside each other.

01:02:57.065 --> 01:03:00.317
'Now there would be
no more holding back.

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:04.947
'Let everyone else fight each other,
hate each other.

01:03:05.073 --> 01:03:07.324
'Just leave us in peace.'

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:33.851
I thought you said you were going
to take the horse in yourself.

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:36.645
What have you done?

01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:40.024
Go. I'll distract them.

01:03:42.903 --> 01:03:45.738
Boys, quick. Now!

01:03:57.250 --> 01:04:00.878
I have a warrant for the arrest
of Benoit Labarie. Where is he?

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:04.173
He's in the field.

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:17.561
I don't know what's wrong
with you farmers.

01:04:17.646 --> 01:04:20.564
Always stashing your guns
in the same places.

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:22.608
Come down.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:24.902
You won't be
in the labour camp for long.

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:28.280
The Viscount begged for leniency.
It's likely to be a year.

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:30.407
Plenty of time
for me to fuck your wife

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:33.202
while you shovel frozen shit
in Buchenwald.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.641
Get off me!

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:02.314
Fuck you.

01:05:04.985 --> 01:05:06.277
Stay there. Don't move.

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:21.250
Benoit!

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:24.795
No, no, no!

01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:33.137
No. Benoit!

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:42.688
Come here. Ssh, ssh...

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:18.265
Madeleine?

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:20.726
Is your mother-in-law at home?

01:06:20.852 --> 01:06:24.772
She's away for the night.
What's happened?

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:29.526
How do you know where he is?

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:31.487
There's an old hunting lodge
in the woods.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.281
No one's offered to take him in?

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:37.368
That's why I'm here.

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:42.998
They let me go
but they're watching me.

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:46.293
If they're watching...

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.254
...you shouldn't have come here.

01:06:49.381 --> 01:06:52.007
Look, Benoit's a good man.

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:55.177
No one else is going to help him.

01:06:55.303 --> 01:06:59.431
He can't move very fast
and they'll hunt him and find him.

01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:03.477
And when they do, they'll kill him.
Do you know that?

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:07.022
You're the only one
that can help me now. Please.

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:12.111
I...

01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:23.163
Sorry, I... I don't...

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:29.461
I thought you said Madame was away.

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:34.800
Your officer won't be coming, you know.

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:38.846
I passed him in the square.

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:42.224
He's leading the search party
for my husband.

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:47.896
Shame on you!

01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:08.125
'What was I thinking?

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:10.836
'My friends and neighbours
were being hunted like animals

01:08:10.962 --> 01:08:12.963
'while I was living out a fantasy.

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:16.341
'A disgraceful madness.'

01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:33.417
What are you doing here?

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:38.590
The dogs have got your scent.
Put these on and come with me.

01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:19.089
Yesterday an officer
of the German Wehrmacht

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.676
was killed by one Benoit Labarie,

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.554
a resident on the Montmort estate.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:31.435
Any person guilty of providing him
with shelter, aid or protection

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:36.607
or who knows his whereabouts
is required to report this information

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:41.153
to German headquarters
within 48 hours of this notice

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:47.451
or they will incur immediate execution
by firing squad.

01:13:25.193 --> 01:13:26.401
Oh.

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:27.569
How romantic.

01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:29.613
I'm going to have to talk
to his commanding officer.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:31.281
No, you won't.

01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:57.140
- Who knows?
- No one.

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:02.270
- Not even his wife?
- I couldn't risk it.

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:06.775
You should have asked me first.

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:22.499
My grandfather put this here
during the last war.

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:27.295
Get in, quickly.

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:30.382
Don't make a sound.

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:09.004
Why are you doing this?

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:14.926
Seeing him dressed in Gaston's clothes,
it made me think...

01:15:16.387 --> 01:15:17.888
...it could be my son.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:22.684
They're here.

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:31.193
Madame.

01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:33.820
We are looking for Benoit Labarie.

01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:56.885
Lucile.

01:15:58.221 --> 01:15:59.971
Lucile, I couldn't get back.

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:07.854
- No!
- Celine, stop!

01:16:08.439 --> 01:16:09.773
Gustav.

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:23.787
We were searching the woods all night.

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:25.538
I know.

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:51.982
Lucile, tell me.
Something's wrong.

01:16:55.903 --> 01:16:57.445
I made a mistake.

01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:06.079
Where's your daughter?

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:11.084
- Where's your daughter?
- She's with her father.

01:17:15.506 --> 01:17:17.590
We'll come back for her.

01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:23.096
Have your feelings changed?

01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:26.016
Yes.

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:27.892
You're lying.

01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:16.816
A wake is being held
for Offizier Bonnet,

01:18:16.984 --> 01:18:20.028
but we don't have enough table linen,
so could we borrow some of yours?

01:18:22.198 --> 01:18:24.199
It belonged to my mother.

01:18:24.325 --> 01:18:28.370
I trust you will return it
in its original state.

01:18:28.496 --> 01:18:29.537
Of course.

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:55.271
Anna?

01:19:46.699 --> 01:19:50.535
Don't fret, you mustn't.
There's still time.

01:19:52.163 --> 01:19:53.955
Somebody might give him up.

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:58.168
- You know, Benoit didn't...
- I know. I know.

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:00.545
You did the right thing.

01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:04.466
God can see into our hearts.

01:20:27.615 --> 01:20:29.115
I love you.

01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:35.205
I love you too.

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:20.852
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:22:46.253 --> 01:22:47.337
Feuer!

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:57.740
'I had told myself
they're just like us after all,

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:58.908
'but they're not.

01:24:01.537 --> 01:24:05.581
'We're a different species,
irreconcilable, enemies forever.'

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:18.386
I won't hide here
till the war's over.

01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:24.934
I'm not afraid of dying.
I just want it to be for a reason.

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:29.063
- What can you do?
- I know people, in Paris.

01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:30.231
Who?

01:24:30.357 --> 01:24:33.484
People who are getting organised,
fighting back.

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:37.613
You'll never get past the checkpoints.
They're everywhere.

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.907
What if I take him?

01:24:40.033 --> 01:24:42.118
Lucile, you can't do that.

01:24:42.244 --> 01:24:43.411
I'm taking you.

01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:48.291
What about the travel pass?

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:03.347
I know where you're going,
you fucking German whore.

01:25:13.734 --> 01:25:15.234
He's safe.

01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:29.016
What are you doing here?

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:36.357
I need a travel pass.

01:26:37.568 --> 01:26:39.610
I have to drive to Paris.

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:44.824
One of our tenants needs medicine.
His daughter's very ill.

01:26:48.745 --> 01:26:50.246
You heard about the Viscount?

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:55.042
Yes.

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:57.169
You must hate me now.

01:26:58.505 --> 01:27:00.506
I would if I were you.

01:27:04.595 --> 01:27:05.761
This tenant...

01:27:08.181 --> 01:27:10.433
Has he come to the house?

01:27:11.935 --> 01:27:15.021
- No.
- That's a shame.

01:27:19.318 --> 01:27:22.403
My orderly says he could smell
a different man's tobacco.

01:27:24.781 --> 01:27:27.199
He thinks you're hiding someone.

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:32.622
And you?

01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:43.382
If I had even the slightest suspicion,

01:27:44.384 --> 01:27:46.427
it would be my duty to act on it.

01:27:50.557 --> 01:27:51.974
I know that.

01:27:56.813 --> 01:28:01.442
I said it was mine,
a gift from my wife.

01:28:11.703 --> 01:28:15.039
I'll instruct my orderly
to issue the pass.

01:28:19.795 --> 01:28:21.295
Thank you.

01:28:40.691 --> 01:28:44.026
We will see each other again.

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:48.280
Not as a soldier.

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:53.911
You won't even recognise me.

01:29:08.051 --> 01:29:12.722
Be careful... with your life.

01:29:22.274 --> 01:29:24.525
Is it precious to you?

01:29:26.153 --> 01:29:27.570
Yes.

01:29:31.450 --> 01:29:34.118
It is precious to me.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.361
Jawohl.

01:32:03.518 --> 01:32:06.061
This is everything
you'll need.

01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:11.025
And, er... Gaston left us this.

01:32:12.402 --> 01:32:14.236
Just in case.

01:32:32.005 --> 01:32:33.422
Thank you.

01:32:48.605 --> 01:32:50.439
Gaston will come back.

01:32:51.691 --> 01:32:53.525
I'm sure of it.

01:33:42.784 --> 01:33:44.285
Thank you.

01:34:03.179 --> 01:34:04.221
Herr Leutnant.

01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:24.885
- Guten Tag.
- Hello.

01:35:25.261 --> 01:35:26.553
Wohin?

01:35:27.722 --> 01:35:30.265
- Where to?
- Paris.

01:35:30.433 --> 01:35:32.142
Papers.

01:36:13.309 --> 01:36:14.309
Out.

01:36:37.292 --> 01:36:38.792
Open.

01:36:48.845 --> 01:36:50.179
Schneller!

01:37:07.614 --> 01:37:09.281
Get down!

01:37:15.038 --> 01:37:16.288
Benoit.

01:37:20.627 --> 01:37:21.668
Hold onto me.

01:38:30.071 --> 01:38:31.113
Help me.

01:38:42.834 --> 01:38:44.334
Open it.

01:40:00.411 --> 01:40:04.665
'Hardly a word of our true feelings
had ever been spoken.

01:40:04.791 --> 01:40:07.459
'Not a single word about love.

01:40:11.506 --> 01:40:15.175
'After the war
