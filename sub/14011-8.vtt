The kid I was after,
I never got a decent look at.

03:50.464 --> 03:53.465
He was young-- 13,14.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.000
What about the one
that got away from Freddo?

03:55.002 --> 03:56.335
Him I saw.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.603
Had a blotch.

Somebody heard
that shot.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.549
In this neighborhood?

04:10.551 --> 04:13.518
You couldn't get

Freddo, go home.

Yeah... sleep.

As far as Internal Affairs is
concerned, yeah, it's closed.

We still got to do
our investigation.

I wouldn't believe

04:48.589 --> 04:51.423

the sky was blue.

You think I like

stuck in my throat.

It's not what it looked
like to that lieutenant--

04:57.598 --> 05:00.332
what's his name?-- Gowdy
from Internal Affairs.

05:00.334 --> 05:01.600

05:01.602 --> 05:02.734
You buy that?

What are you
selling, Max?

05:04.738 --> 05:07.339
No witnesses,
a dead kid.
So?

05:07.341 --> 05:10.475
If a civilian shot a kid,
no witnesses, all I'm saying is,

05:10.477 --> 05:13.478
they wouldn't wrap it up
in ten minutes.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.714
Four dollars an hour I pay him.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.616
Good money for delivery.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.623
We're canvassing
all the merchants, looking for

05:24.625 --> 05:30.028
a young man, 22-23, black,
with a birthmark on his cheek.

05:30.030 --> 05:33.532
I got five orders
waiting to deliver.

How long do you
have to wait

05:35.135 --> 05:36.735

somebody missing, huh?

05:36.737 --> 05:38.637
A birthmark?

05:38.639 --> 05:39.738
Like this?

05:39.740 --> 05:42.507
He comes in every afternoon.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.644
He buys two chocolate moon pies.
Two.

You ain't cool.

Get out of my school.

The name of the game
is finding fame.

06:04.365 --> 06:05.597
Silky's the name

06:05.599 --> 06:06.965
and he's to blame.
Silky?

06:06.967 --> 06:08.567
I wouldn't tell them nothing.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.502
Silky who?

06:10.504 --> 06:14.539
Ford. Lives over
on Vyse Avenue, 108.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.616
Silky... Silky Ford.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.385
Live around here?

06:26.387 --> 06:28.653
Don't I wish
he didn't.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.522
Hmm. One of
your favorites, huh?

06:30.524 --> 06:35.160
Some boys make trouble
'cause they got trouble.

06:35.162 --> 06:38.096
Silky? He's looking
for trouble.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.698
What'd he do, walk off
a white man?

06:39.700 --> 06:41.800
Is it this building here?

06:41.802 --> 06:45.737
You all only come up here
when a white man gets hurt.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.440
Why aren't you here
all the time?

06:48.442 --> 06:50.008
Silky Ford?

06:50.010 --> 06:52.444
Fourth floor.

06:52.446 --> 06:55.113
He just come in.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.581
Nah, man,
nobody here but me.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.716
Let's take a look.

06:57.718 --> 07:00.152
Oh, no, you're blind

birthmark on his right cheek.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.193
Birth mark, right cheek.

07:08.195 --> 07:11.062
Oh, yeah, that
sound like Silky.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.265
You seen him lately?

07:13.266 --> 07:15.467
No. He's been in
Philadelphia,
visiting his sister.

07:15.469 --> 07:19.638
She's in the
hospital. Mumps.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.173
Whoa, be gentle!

07:21.175 --> 07:23.508
You want
to tear my suits?

07:23.510 --> 07:24.743
Where you going, man?

07:24.745 --> 07:26.178
That's just the kitchen.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.813
Ain't nobody in there.

07:32.186 --> 07:34.753
Waxing the floor, Silky?

07:34.755 --> 07:38.623
Yeah, yeah,
we're cleaning up.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.825
Whoa, man!

07:39.827 --> 07:41.193
Who did you clean up
last night?

07:41.195 --> 07:43.662
I was home
all night long.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.763
Doing the floor?
Yeah.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.765
They got dirty
real fast.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.200
We had a party.

07:48.202 --> 07:49.634
Who was here?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.236
Me and Richard.
It was a private party.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.104
Let's takes a ride,
Silky, huh?

07:53.106 --> 07:55.640
I got, I got things to do,
man. I got a busy day...

07:55.642 --> 07:58.777
Your first appointment
is with us, okay?

07:58.779 --> 08:00.645
What you looking at?
Let go, man.

Take Davis out the back
before Freddo comes in.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.852
Davis?

08:06.854 --> 08:09.654
What, you think he's going
to lie for Freddo?

08:09.656 --> 08:13.124
No, they're
both choirboys.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.794
Ready?
Yeah. I even found
another black guy

08:15.796 --> 08:17.529
with a birthmark.
Go ahead.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.606
Number three.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.674
Number three,

08:29.676 --> 08:31.610
step forward, please.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.786
Yeah, more
than the others.

08:41.788 --> 08:45.223
I'm playing
elimination here.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.792
I saw him ten seconds
in the dark.

08:47.794 --> 08:50.295
You want me
to say I'm sure?

08:50.297 --> 08:51.730
I'm not.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.164
Hey, Davis.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.866
Take it easy,
all right?

08:54.868 --> 08:57.702
I'm not asking you
to lie.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.713
Could be...

09:08.715 --> 09:10.815
could be number three.

09:10.817 --> 09:15.654
Geez, I'm not sure enough
for an I.D.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.324
It was dark.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.695
What was that about,
keeping those two apart?

09:23.697 --> 09:26.231
Ten years ago,
I'm working Central Park

09:26.233 --> 09:28.700
in the fall. The whole place
smells like a sewer.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.669
The captain says
I'm imagining it.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.170
Lieutenant says
I'm imagining it.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.272
Turns out it's some tree
with flowers that rot.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.741
Lasts about a week.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.678
Hey, what... am I
missing something here?

09:39.680 --> 09:42.814
This thing smells, too.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.617
Internal Affairs
says I'm imagining it.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.252
Cragen says
I'm imagining it.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.654
And you're not
imagining it.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.723
On Silky? Two maybes?

09:51.725 --> 09:53.592
Both cops aren't sure?

09:53.594 --> 09:55.727
Max, these guys are cops.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.729
They're<i> cops.</i>

09:57.731 --> 10:01.266
90% of all police officers
forget about killing.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.867
They go 30 years,
never fire a gun.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.803
Freddo?
I heard this morning--

10:04.805 --> 10:05.804
second time.

10:05.806 --> 10:10.041
Makes you wonder,
that's all.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.711
Yeah, it also makes you wonder
how many cops died thinking

10:12.713 --> 10:15.013
"that's not a gun in his hand."

10:17.684 --> 10:20.885
Well, we can't
hold Silky.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.827
I sent the prints out.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.395
No I.D.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.696
No record?

10:31.698 --> 10:32.964
Came up blank.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.400
You see that evidence bag?

10:35.402 --> 10:36.835
What evidence bag?

10:36.837 --> 10:38.403
I sent it over.

10:38.405 --> 10:41.540
Wheel of fortune.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.676
The kid had 3,000 bucks on him
in his sock.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.713
Here's one set of prints.

10:48.715 --> 10:49.814
The dead kid?

10:49.816 --> 10:51.282
Yeah.

10:51.284 --> 10:54.786
Only one set of prints,
like somebody wiped the gun.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.688
Hey, Max, you're
drawing conclusions.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.823
Let's just say I
heard a dog bark.

10:58.825 --> 10:59.958
Serial number?

10:59.960 --> 11:00.959
It's clean.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.961
Not a file job, acid.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.396
Dog's barking
louder.

11:04.398 --> 11:05.764

11:30.090 --> 11:31.856
Beautiful piece,
that Magnum.

11:31.858 --> 11:35.727
Tender loving care
to clean it off.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.862
Has it been worked on?

11:37.864 --> 11:40.065
By someone very good.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.403
R-ten twist.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.771
Clear as a bell.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.708
Let's go back a few months.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.777
See if we can find a match.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.147
LOGAN:
The Magnum's clean.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.716

Bang.

12:07.794 --> 12:08.893

12:08.895 --> 12:10.862
They're like opinions.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.864
Everybody's got one.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.366
It's been cleaned up.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.003
Yours?

12:19.005 --> 12:21.773
Nice work,
whoever did it.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.775
New kind of lock?

12:23.777 --> 12:25.477
Double cylinder,
spring release.

12:25.479 --> 12:27.979
Yeah, illegal in this city.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.948
To install, not sell.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.116
Unpickable.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.984
Yeah,
for six months.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.352
Single cylinder?

12:34.354 --> 12:36.454
Wait a minute.

12:36.456 --> 12:37.789
This one hot?

12:37.791 --> 12:38.990
No?

12:38.992 --> 12:40.992
Bust me
for a misdemeanor.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.994
I'll be out in an hour.

12:42.996 --> 12:46.765
We keep busting you
and them hours add up.

12:46.767 --> 12:47.532
He dead?

12:47.534 --> 12:49.901
Never laid eyes on him.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.075
Lose a lot of business
when the door's locked.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.544
The Magnum's his.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.480
A month ago, six weeks.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.915
You positive?

13:03.917 --> 13:05.850
What do you want,
the name of his dog?

13:05.852 --> 13:07.452
Yeah, that's him.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.488
Great.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.956
Hey... what?!

13:11.958 --> 13:13.825
The kid,
the one the cop shot--

13:13.827 --> 13:15.393
he had your gun in his hand.

13:15.395 --> 13:18.963
Sing a song for me, Silky.
This is murder.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.565
If you're involved,
it won't be probation.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.000
The other night when you were
waxing the floor,

13:22.002 --> 13:23.501
this kid with you?

13:23.503 --> 13:26.171
I seen him around here, man,
but I don't know his name.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.472
How did he get your gun?

13:27.474 --> 13:30.041
I sold it to him.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.476
You don't know his name
and you sold him your gun?

13:31.478 --> 13:32.844
I didn't need to
know his name.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.546
A sister I know
brought him over.

13:34.548 --> 13:35.814
What's her name?

13:35.816 --> 13:37.515
Doris. She's real fresh.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.551
Turn around and put your hands
on top of your head.

13:39.553 --> 13:40.852
For what?
Turn around

13:40.854 --> 13:41.519
and put your hands
on top of your head!

13:41.521 --> 13:43.521
Felony, Silky.
Oh, man!

13:43.523 --> 13:45.523
You just confessed
to selling a weapon.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.560
You have the right
to remain silent.

13:48.562 --> 13:49.828
Anything you say...

13:49.830 --> 13:51.496
What is this,
a class D?

13:51.498 --> 13:53.498
It's a walk, mabn.
I'm out in a day.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.600
You have the right
to an attorney...

13:56.503 --> 14:00.438
Hey, youu know what this
is going to cost me?

14:00.440 --> 14:03.007
My lawyer gets
$300 an hour, man.

14:03.009 --> 14:06.010
Think about where you were
the other night, Silky.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.946
I'd like to know.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.284
You know the kid
Freddo shot?

14:13.286 --> 14:15.553
Maybe he did
have the gun.

14:15.555 --> 14:20.291
Right. Silky sold him a Magnum,
he gave him an I.O.U.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.993
and then stuck 3,000
in his shoe.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.628
Max, he could have bought
the gun a week ago.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.964
Run this by me again?

14:25.966 --> 14:28.633
Freddo and Davis
saw a guy with a birthmark

14:28.635 --> 14:32.804
but it wasn't Silky.

14:32.805 --> 14:36.974
Silky sold the dead kid a gun,
but he wasn't there that night.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.581
I don't know
any Silky,

14:43.583 --> 14:44.983
and I don't know
nothing about dope.

14:44.985 --> 14:48.086
Who said anything about dope?

14:48.088 --> 14:49.654
Well, I got nothing
to tell you.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.522
Well, how about we take you
down to the precinct?

14:51.524 --> 14:54.259
Come on, you can't take me.
You got no charge.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.994
Doris, a guy is dead.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.229
Yeah, well, like you care.
Wrong.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.565
You care so much, you probably
belong to the N.A.A.C.P.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.600
You introduced
this kid to Silky?

15:02.602 --> 15:05.336
He had Silky's gun
in his hand when he died.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.171
Silky says
you were there

15:07.173 --> 15:09.574
when he sold
the kid the piece.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.042
No way.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.577
No wah. That's a lie.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.246
Who is he, Doris?

15:17.617 --> 15:19.984
It's Tommy Richardson.

15:19.986 --> 15:21.953
Where does he live?

15:24.324 --> 15:27.992
103rd, Lexington and Park.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.063
You seen
your brother Tommy?

15:32.065 --> 15:34.065
He ain't here.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.934
Well, where is he?

15:35.936 --> 15:37.602
I don't know

15:37.604 --> 15:42.040
but you'd better come back,
when my mom gets home.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.609
Where is your mom, Abel?

15:44.611 --> 15:45.710
Working.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.712
Where does she work?

15:47.714 --> 15:49.547
In an office building.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.249
She's a cleaning lady.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.651
She doesn't get back
till late.

15:53.653 --> 15:58.323
Abel, you'd better
come with us.

15:58.325 --> 16:02.060
Hey, boy, take a chair
right here, all right?

16:02.062 --> 16:04.395
Did you call
Reverend Thayer?

16:04.397 --> 16:07.131
Yeah, we called him.

16:07.133 --> 16:10.335
So when was the last time
you saw your brother?

16:10.337 --> 16:11.602
Abel?

16:11.604 --> 16:12.737
It's all right.
It's all right.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.605
Detective Logan,
Sergeant Greevey.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.607
Bringing a boy
down here?

16:16.609 --> 16:17.709
What's the reason?

16:17.711 --> 16:19.310
What did he do?

16:19.312 --> 16:21.679
Well, eems his brother pulled
a gun on a policeman

16:21.681 --> 16:23.865
night before last.

16:23.866 --> 16:26.050
No... no, no, no,
you got the wrong boy.

16:26.052 --> 16:28.686
I don't think so.

16:52.312 --> 16:57.048
Tommy Richardson
wouldn't have a gun.

16:57.050 --> 17:00.651
Tommy Richardson
was a...

17:00.653 --> 17:04.355
an honor student
at Pinceton University.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.632
(<i> crowd chantiing angrily</i> )

17:28.615 --> 17:31.582
MAN:
Why would a Princeton honors
student shoot a policeman?

17:31.584 --> 17:33.217
WOMAN:
Did you know that
Tommy Richardson

17:33.219 --> 17:35.620
lectured at
his old high school
against drugs?

17:35.622 --> 17:38.289
Can you make some kind
of a statement?

17:38.291 --> 17:40.291
(<i> camera shutters clicking</i> )

17:40.293 --> 17:42.260
Whatever happened
that night,

17:42.262 --> 17:44.062
we just got shoved
out a plane

17:44.064 --> 17:47.231
at 30,000 feet,
no parachute.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.234
(<i> angry shouting</i> )

17:50.236 --> 17:52.637
Nice, straightforward
little case, huh?

17:52.639 --> 17:55.706
So the wrap-it-up-
no-problem boys said.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.642
Why did Freddo
and Davis

17:57.644 --> 18:00.344
go soft on Silky
at the lineup?

18:00.346 --> 18:02.230
They made
a mistake.

18:02.231 --> 18:04.115
Yeah. They thought nobody
would know they were lying.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.250
If you're wrong
and you go after cops...

18:06.252 --> 18:08.186
If I'm wrong,

18:08.187 --> 18:10.121
I'll go to the grand jury
and say I killed the kid.

18:15.862 --> 18:19.130
Yeah, I can use the time off.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.198
You heard about the kid?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.166
Princeton?

18:22.168 --> 18:24.836
Yeah, just goes to show you.

18:24.838 --> 18:28.406
Homeboys-- no matter
how fancy you dress them up,

18:28.408 --> 18:31.309
they can still gun down a cop
just like any street scum.

18:31.311 --> 18:35.313
The dude you and Davis
passed on in the lineup, Freddo,

18:35.315 --> 18:38.349
it's hard to believe
that his gun was there
and he wasn't.

18:38.351 --> 18:42.186
Now, if he happens to say
he<i> was</i> there,

18:42.188 --> 18:44.222
that contradicts you.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.823
What is this?!

18:45.825 --> 18:48.159
I got 23 years
in the force!

18:48.161 --> 18:49.894
Now, who you
going to trust

18:49.896 --> 18:51.696
me or some eggplant?!

18:51.698 --> 18:53.898
Gee, Mike, he sure sounds

18:53.900 --> 18:55.833
trustworthy to me.

18:55.835 --> 18:56.701
How about you?

18:56.703 --> 18:57.535
Hey! Hey!

19:01.374 --> 19:03.641
Easy, Freddo.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.643
Next time you want to ask me
something,

19:05.645 --> 19:07.912
talk to my P.O.B.A. Rep.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.349
The man has two decades,

19:11.351 --> 19:12.783
and where
the police officer's

19:12.785 --> 19:14.285
benevolent association
stands,

19:14.287 --> 19:15.386
that merits
a certain respect.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.688
Benevolent means
I don't investigate?

19:17.690 --> 19:21.325
Max. You know, you
arrive at his home
unannounced

19:21.327 --> 19:23.728
and you treat him like
some punk murderer.

19:23.730 --> 19:24.729
Freddo's no punk.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.397
Oh, but he is a murderer.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.366
That's what we're investigating.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.735
Look, it is Sergeant Greevey's
job to investigate,

19:30.737 --> 19:32.470
but Max, if you are
all over this officer,

19:32.472 --> 19:33.671
it's gonna have to stop.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.374
We'll talk.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.248
Rock and a hard place.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.350
My butt, Max--
mine, not yours.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.452
This is not a bad cop.

19:48.454 --> 19:51.923
Neither are you, neither am I,
but some things we don't do.

19:51.925 --> 19:53.457
If we don't fix this fast,

19:53.459 --> 19:54.892
the brotherhood
is going to crucify us.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.461
If we do, the black community
is going to crucify us.

19:57.463 --> 19:59.463
Then let's do it right.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.246
Careful.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.848
Yeah, we all
got to be careful.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.785
More careful
than Freddo was.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.521
Enough people have
already gotten hurt.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.856
Which is why
we're investigating.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.925
Detectives.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.860
You sit
behind a desk.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.463
You guys have no idea
what it's like

20:32.465 --> 20:34.332
on the streets
these days.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.267
Come on. What's that
supposed to mean?

20:36.269 --> 20:37.535
Close ranks, Logan.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.403
Hey, I have, okay?

20:39.405 --> 20:40.538
With my partner.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.772
Your partner?
Get off me!

20:41.774 --> 20:43.474
(<i> shouting angrily</i> )

20:43.476 --> 20:45.776
Tell him to join
the A.C.L.U., huh?

20:45.778 --> 20:48.779
This... this punk...

20:48.781 --> 20:51.382
okay, he went to
some fancy school.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.883
I don't care if he was
head of the class.

20:52.885 --> 20:56.854
Those three skells
were doing a drug deal.

20:58.725 --> 21:02.893
Yeah, well, we're all
on the same side, right, Davis?

21:02.895 --> 21:06.264
You could have
fooled me.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.943
This week--
not easy, is it?

21:20.480 --> 21:22.013
(<i> chuckling</i> )

21:22.015 --> 21:26.450
Well, we're out there
all alone, Max.

21:26.452 --> 21:29.420
Let me tell you something.

21:29.422 --> 21:32.023
Everybody else is wrong

21:32.025 --> 21:34.458
and I think you like that.

21:34.460 --> 21:38.562
I don't like being told
to roll over.

21:38.564 --> 21:40.564
Davis swears the kid
was doing a drug deal.

21:40.566 --> 21:41.899
He swears it.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.035
Okay. Fine.

21:44.037 --> 21:46.604
Assume everybody's
telling the truth.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.572
A Magnum on the street--
what's it go for?

21:48.574 --> 21:49.974
500.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.009
Right. Half a pound
of crack?

21:52.011 --> 21:53.477
2500.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.480
Richardson kid had 3,000 bucks
in his socks

21:56.482 --> 21:59.350
supposed to buy a gun and drugs.

21:59.352 --> 22:02.320
Drug dealers don't take credit.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.358
All right,
the deal never went down.

22:07.360 --> 22:12.029
Which means the kid
never had the gun.

22:12.031 --> 22:15.599
Freddo shot him,
put the Magnum in his hand

22:15.601 --> 22:17.535
and he gave Silky a walk.

22:17.537 --> 22:18.969
That's why nobody's talking.

22:18.971 --> 22:24.442
We still got to turn up
the third guy.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.544
GREEVEY:
If Silky's not your friend...

22:26.546 --> 22:28.412
I don't have any friends.

22:28.414 --> 22:29.547
They die too quick.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.382
How about enemies?

22:31.384 --> 22:32.917
Enemies, too.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.419
Up here, nobody gets to 40.

22:35.421 --> 22:38.089
Three people that night, Doris.

22:38.091 --> 22:40.858
You knew Tommy,
you know Silky.

22:40.860 --> 22:44.128
And I know whatever I tell you,
it only means you lock them up.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.864
Hey, hey, now,
we're trying
to find out

22:46.866 --> 22:49.533
why Tommy Richardson
is dead.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.402
The way we heart it,
he was your friend.

22:51.404 --> 22:55.139
Seems to me
you owe him
his propers.

22:55.141 --> 22:58.943
Who was
the third guy?

22:58.945 --> 23:02.046
He's just a scared little boy.

23:02.048 --> 23:06.450
Abel. Tommy's little brother.

23:06.452 --> 23:09.520
GREEVEY:
Tommy and Silky
were doing a drug deal.

23:09.522 --> 23:12.490
LOGAN:
You think Tommy
would shoot a cop?

23:12.492 --> 23:14.658
Tommy never had a gun.

23:14.660 --> 23:19.530
If your brother was here now,
what would he tell you to do?

23:23.403 --> 23:26.437
Tommy was going to buy the gun.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.072
For 500.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.942
And the dope?

23:31.944 --> 23:34.412
Crack, a half a pound.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.113
For 2500.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.181
20 extra.

23:37.183 --> 23:40.518
We were going to go
to the movies,

23:40.520 --> 23:42.987
but the cops came. We ran.

23:42.989 --> 23:45.589
Silky still had the gun.

23:52.165 --> 23:54.465
Okay.

23:54.467 --> 23:55.933
Okay what?

23:55.935 --> 23:59.904
Sometimes when I don't want
to see something,

23:59.906 --> 24:02.072
then I put blinders on.

24:02.074 --> 24:04.141
What's that, a confession?

24:05.945 --> 24:08.145
An apology.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.685
Richardson
had the money.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.954
Silky had the gun.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.223
What happened to the dope?

24:19.225 --> 24:21.225
There was no dope.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.726
Never had it.

24:22.728 --> 24:25.496
Oh, yeah, Richardson met you
to buy groceries, huh?

24:25.498 --> 24:28.666
My lawyer-- he'll have me out
of here in an hour.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.669
You could still go up
on that gun charge, Silky.

24:31.671 --> 24:35.206
I never been convicted
of no felony.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.674
Even if you prove
I sold him the gun,

24:36.676 --> 24:37.942
I still walk.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.778
Jailhouse lawyer here.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.614
A witness puts you
at the scene that night.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.750
Abel.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.622
All right.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.157
I was there.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.258
That what
you want to hear?

24:54.260 --> 24:55.793
Tommy had the gun.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.528
He drew on the cop,
the cop shot him.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.796
That's what happened.

24:58.798 --> 25:01.565
Playing this all wrong, Silky.

25:01.567 --> 25:05.536
I'm still breathing, ain't I?

25:05.538 --> 25:07.271
What did this guy do?

25:07.273 --> 25:08.706
Shoot the pope?

25:08.708 --> 25:10.674
What are you
talking about?

25:10.676 --> 25:12.009
Pretty popular.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.211
Had another cop in
this morning.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.546
Who?

25:15.548 --> 25:18.048
Parisi.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.718
Freddo Parisi.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.220
GREEVEY:
Well, the kid say, "I'm
breathing" means Freddo
threatened us.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.822
I admit,
it doesn't sound good.

25:24.824 --> 25:27.091
Silky's lying,
Freddo's lying.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.693
Davis is covering for him.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.596
Freddo's arrested--
maybe somebody breaks.

25:32.598 --> 25:34.298
D.A. says the same thing,

25:34.300 --> 25:37.568
but it's a cop, so it's got to
be an Internal Affairs collar.

25:37.570 --> 25:41.605
I.A.D. cuts a guy some slack
and his own precinct burns him.

25:41.607 --> 25:43.641
What a world.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.797
You're under arrest

26:06.799 --> 26:09.333
for the murder
of Thomas Richardson.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.236
You have the right
to remain silent.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.238
Anything you say
can and will be...

26:14.240 --> 26:16.140
Save it, wise guy.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.309
I know it by heart.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.898
You're dreaming, Counselor.

26:23.899 --> 26:25.783
And the Richardson boy--
no record and no gun.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.117
Yes, says his 13-year-old
brother.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.019
With no reason
to lie.

26:29.021 --> 26:31.322
The kid's a lousy witness.
He wasn't even there.

26:31.324 --> 26:32.957
When I get finished
with him,

26:32.959 --> 26:35.993
a jury won't take his word
on what he ate for breakfast.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.061
And Patrolman Parisi?

26:37.063 --> 26:38.228
LAWYER:
A veteran cop.

26:38.230 --> 26:41.231
His word, Davis's word,
Silky's word--

26:41.233 --> 26:42.750
all against the kid

26:42.751 --> 26:44.268
who wants to protect
his brother's reputation.

26:44.270 --> 26:47.037
And who's a jury
gonna believe?

26:47.039 --> 26:49.807
By the time we go to trial,
Patrolman,

26:49.809 --> 26:52.876
Silky will be
telling the truth.

26:52.878 --> 26:54.595
It turns out
Abel's not clean,

26:54.596 --> 26:56.313
they scuff him up
on the stand,
Freddo walks.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.182
Abel has no record.

26:58.183 --> 27:00.050
Neither did his brother. I don't
want a last-minute sandbag.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.852
Make sure, Paul.

27:03.923 --> 27:06.290
Abel's been in no trouble.

27:06.292 --> 27:09.026
Are you going to see
your brother--

27:09.028 --> 27:10.027
Tommy Richardson--

27:10.029 --> 27:11.195
gets justice?

27:11.197 --> 27:12.930
I'm an officer of the court.

27:12.932 --> 27:15.032
I'll investigate
every aspect of the case.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.066
Color has...

27:16.068 --> 27:17.868
Nothing to do with it.

27:19.939 --> 27:24.241
Well, maybe I'm mistaking
who you are.

27:24.243 --> 27:30.381
You grow up on Park Avenue,
south of 96th Street?

27:30.383 --> 27:33.017
That isn't relevant to this.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.251
No?

27:34.253 --> 27:35.886
No father?

27:35.888 --> 27:37.054
That's right.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.024
Took off?

27:40.026 --> 27:42.259
Even you, Mr. Robinette?

27:42.261 --> 27:46.196
All black fathers
leave their children?

27:46.198 --> 27:50.000
Tommy Richardson's father
was a subway motorman.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.269
Usually worked two shifts.

27:52.271 --> 27:56.774
Somebody shot him for 20 bucks
he'd won at O.T.B.

27:56.776 --> 27:59.343
Now, Tommy
Richardson
was a hero

27:59.345 --> 28:00.911
in this community.

28:00.913 --> 28:03.881
He came from
a good family.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.416
He went to a good college.

28:05.418 --> 28:08.285
He brought home money
for the church,

28:08.287 --> 28:11.021
for the children's enrichment
program,

28:11.023 --> 28:13.023
for the boy's choir.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.291
Well, how much money?

28:14.293 --> 28:15.859
From where?

28:17.163 --> 28:19.430
Family named Harriman.

28:19.432 --> 28:22.032
Tommy's college roommate.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.035
They gave $48,000 in secret.

28:27.039 --> 28:30.040
How much?

28:30.042 --> 28:32.309
$48,000.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.044
My God.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.914
Your family
didn't give the money?

28:36.916 --> 28:38.048
No.

28:38.050 --> 28:41.051
Where did he get it?

28:41.053 --> 28:45.289
Till the end of the semester,
I really liked Tommy.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.157
He was smart, funny.

28:47.159 --> 28:51.061
Exam period,
I'd come back at night and...

28:51.063 --> 28:53.964
People he was
hanging out with.

28:53.966 --> 28:54.932
Street people?

28:54.934 --> 28:55.999
Yeah...

28:56.001 --> 28:57.201
Wall Street.

28:57.203 --> 29:01.105
J. Press suits,
Fisher skis, Beamers...

29:01.107 --> 29:03.073
Trust fund babies.

29:03.075 --> 29:06.210
Tommy-- it was like
he was in China.

29:06.212 --> 29:08.078
Didn't know the language.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.947
He couldn't make friends.

29:09.949 --> 29:12.983
These guys wanted
to score some coke

29:12.985 --> 29:14.284
and Tommy's black--

29:14.286 --> 29:15.953
like he ought to know.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.088
Friendship wasn't the point.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.356
Customers.

29:19.358 --> 29:20.958
You know any of them?

29:20.960 --> 29:23.026
Wesley Parker.

29:23.028 --> 29:24.495
Have a seat.

29:24.497 --> 29:27.965
I want to talk to you
about Tommy Richardson.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.233
What about him?

29:30.369 --> 29:33.137
He sold you drugs.

29:33.139 --> 29:36.373
No, hey, man, I don't know
who you've been talking to.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.359
There's no way.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.344
I take a walk around here,
you think I'll find some dope?

29:40.346 --> 29:43.347
Whatever you want to know.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.149
Why did you hang with Tommy?

29:45.151 --> 29:48.418
I don't want to get myself
arrested here.

29:50.389 --> 29:54.224
Let's say Tommy
never got<i> me</i> any drugs.

29:54.226 --> 29:56.093
But your friends?

29:56.095 --> 29:57.528
Tommy was tough.

29:57.530 --> 30:00.130
He knew how the world worked.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.999
Know what I mean?

30:02.001 --> 30:04.501
He was going to be real major.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.937
Yeah, Wesley.

30:06.939 --> 30:09.273
A major homicide.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.974
CROWD:
<i> We want justice!</i>

30:10.976 --> 30:13.043
<i> We want justice!</i>
<i> We want justice!</i>

30:13.045 --> 30:14.111
<i> We want justice!</i>

30:14.113 --> 30:15.445
To them, he's a hero.

30:15.447 --> 30:18.081
We're going
to destroy that dream.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.184
The truth will set you free,
it won't always make you happy.

30:20.186 --> 30:22.085
But he wasn't all bad.

30:22.087 --> 30:23.053
A trial, Ben?

30:23.055 --> 30:24.488
His name's dirt.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.957
In Harlem,
kid goes away

30:26.959 --> 30:28.091
to a good school,

30:28.093 --> 30:30.561
brings back money
to the community...

30:30.563 --> 30:32.095
A candidate for sainthood?

30:32.097 --> 30:33.997
The good part
of him, yeah.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.967
Maybe he needed the bad part
to make the good part work.

30:36.969 --> 30:40.103
Maybe being the tough black kid
in college, the street kid,

30:40.105 --> 30:43.006
helped him to come home
and give away money.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.309
Robin Hood? You think
that'd play with the jury?

30:45.311 --> 30:47.044
They find out
he's a drug dealer,

30:47.046 --> 30:48.345
they'll never believe
he didn't have a gun.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.047
Then make a deal.

30:50.049 --> 30:53.183
Freddo does a couple years,
Tommy's name stays clean.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.384
Can't do it, Paul.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.320
You can't let killers walk.

30:56.322 --> 30:57.988
(<i> phone rings</i> )

30:57.990 --> 30:59.056
Stone.

30:59.058 --> 31:01.058
Yes, send them in.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.126
The Richardsons.

31:03.128 --> 31:06.330
Mrs. Richardson,
thanks for coming down.

31:06.332 --> 31:07.965
Is this Abel?

31:07.967 --> 31:09.199
Yes, it is.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.334
How you doing?
Come in.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.169
Sit right down.
Thank you.

31:16.976 --> 31:20.344
Mrs. Richardson,
when this case goes to trial,

31:20.346 --> 31:24.214
there may be unpleasant things
said about your son.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.384
I read in the papers

31:27.386 --> 31:30.153
that the policeman
could go free.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.157
Mrs. Richardson...

31:35.227 --> 31:37.361
My husband was killed.

31:37.363 --> 31:41.031
Tommy was ten years old.

31:41.033 --> 31:47.204
That boy... he started
coming home from school late.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.372
Two, three hours.

31:48.374 --> 31:49.439
I thought he was hanging out

31:49.441 --> 31:51.508
on the streets.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.510
After-school job

31:53.512 --> 31:55.279
made him late.

31:55.281 --> 31:59.549
Delivering groceries
to help me out.

31:59.551 --> 32:03.287
Tommy spent his<i> whole</i> life

32:03.289 --> 32:07.024
just taking care
of other people.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.192
He had some problems.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.497
My boy got out of Harlem.

32:13.499 --> 32:17.401
That's what white people
wanted him to do

32:17.403 --> 32:19.536
and it's what
I wanted him to do.

32:19.538 --> 32:24.541
Mr. Stone, could I talk to you
outside for a second?

32:24.543 --> 32:27.110
You're going
to kill my mom.

32:27.112 --> 32:30.514
This drug deal on the street,
Abel, this wasn't
a one-shot thing, was it?

32:30.516 --> 32:32.382
You can't do this
to my mom.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.117
It's not us doing it.

32:34.119 --> 32:37.521
Reverend Thayer, your mother--
everybody wants justice.

32:37.523 --> 32:39.256
But I have to know
what really happened.

32:39.258 --> 32:42.159
Tommy was moving
a ton of dope.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.260
At Princeton?

32:43.262 --> 32:44.428
Every two weeks.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.096
He buy it here?

32:46.098 --> 32:49.266
Um, he had this mule...

32:49.268 --> 32:52.135
moved it down on the train.

32:52.137 --> 32:54.071
This mule have a name?

32:54.073 --> 32:55.305
A girl.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.208
A girl named Doris.

32:58.210 --> 33:01.611
I don't know nothiing, okay?
He's dead and I'm still here.

33:01.613 --> 33:02.612
That's all I know.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.448
When you were
on the stroll...

33:04.450 --> 33:05.716
Yeah, well,
that's old news.

33:05.718 --> 33:07.718
Not old enough for the
statute of limitations.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.420
You jumped bail.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.121
Yeah, well, I forgot to show up
at court.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.623
You want a reminder?

33:12.624 --> 33:14.124
Okay, you want it
straight up, Oreo?

33:14.126 --> 33:16.159
Tommy asked me
to score some coke.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.661
Gave me money.
Train ticket said

33:17.663 --> 33:19.463
to bring it to down
to someplace in Jersey.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.331
Smart move,
Doris.
He paid me so much,

33:21.333 --> 33:22.599
I stopped
turning tricks.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.201
'Cause of him,
I got out of the life.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.736
Oh, great. Hooking
to drug dealing?

33:25.738 --> 33:27.537
Yeah, which would you
rather sell--

33:27.539 --> 33:30.540
drugs or your body?

33:33.445 --> 33:37.581
CROWD:
<i> We want justice!</i>
<i> We want justice!</i>

33:42.154 --> 33:46.156
<i> New york's finest!</i>
<i> New york's finest!</i>

33:55.701 --> 33:58.602
Yeah, real stupid, Stone.

33:58.604 --> 34:00.337
Grand jury's decision,
not mine.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.472
We're not gonna have
to smear that kid.

34:02.474 --> 34:03.774
He already
smeared himself.

34:03.776 --> 34:05.542
Tommy Richardson's dead.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.778
He's not on trial for
drugs or anything else.

34:07.780 --> 34:11.281
Freddo had every reason
to believe that the kid
was going to shoot him.

34:11.283 --> 34:13.583
When Freddo shoots,
what would you have done?

34:13.585 --> 34:16.386
I wouldn't put a gun
in a dead kid's hand.

34:16.388 --> 34:20.390
I hope you're prepared
to go to trial and prove that

34:20.392 --> 34:21.658
and soon.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.493
I'll see you there.
Yeah.

34:25.631 --> 34:28.165
I don't care, I want you
to try for a deal
with Freddo.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.400
Am I mistaken or did you
just take a stand

34:30.402 --> 34:31.802
about a community
having to have its laws?

34:31.804 --> 34:34.104
That is
a public position.

34:34.105 --> 34:36.405
I'm telling you right now
that you do not have enough
to convict Parisi.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.674
Then don't shut me down.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.409
The partner won't roll.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.411
You've got nothing
to offer Silky.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.280
And if Freddo's
not interested?

34:43.282 --> 34:44.414
Make it sweet.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.283
Down for four,
out in two. Convince him.

34:46.285 --> 34:48.785
Adam, really...
99% of the time,
I let you run with it.

34:48.787 --> 34:51.288
I've got to do what's best
for the office.

34:53.358 --> 34:55.792
Gentlemen, come in.

35:02.201 --> 35:06.436
FREDDO:
My lawyer, Mr. Hillery,
says I could use the company.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.239
HILLERY:
I'm sure we remember
each other.

35:10.843 --> 35:13.510
My, uh... my ex-wife cleaned up.

35:14.847 --> 35:16.713
Would you like a drink?

35:16.715 --> 35:18.448
No, thanks.

35:18.450 --> 35:22.719
No wife, no friends, no nobody.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.454
From what I've
seen, you have

35:24.456 --> 35:25.589
plenty of friends.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.591
Protecting their own, pal.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.227
Most of them,
they don't even know me.

35:30.229 --> 35:32.829
A lot of people downtown
would really prefer it

35:32.831 --> 35:34.731
if you didn't
go to trial.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.600
If you plead
to manslaughter,

35:36.602 --> 35:38.435
you can be out
in one year--

35:38.437 --> 35:39.569
two at the most.

35:39.571 --> 35:42.739
You guys
,with your jobs and your suits

35:42.741 --> 35:44.641
and your
press conferences...

35:44.643 --> 35:45.709
Freddo...

35:45.711 --> 35:47.644
You want to take from me

35:47.646 --> 35:49.713
the one thing I got left.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.848
My trial is going to prove

35:51.850 --> 35:54.885
that Ivy League<i> moulanyan</i>
was a punk!

36:00.626 --> 36:03.693
I want my day in court.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.536
Before you ran from the police,

36:12.538 --> 36:15.739
did your brother or Silky Ford
have a gun?

36:15.741 --> 36:18.575
Silky had a gun
stuck into his jeans.

36:18.577 --> 36:19.843
Did you see the gun?

36:19.845 --> 36:21.878
I could see the handle.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.915
It was a Magnum,
like Dirty Harry.

36:24.917 --> 36:27.584
You know, "make my day."

36:27.586 --> 36:29.553
On the street that night,
you had a fight.

36:29.555 --> 36:30.787
What was that about?

36:30.789 --> 36:35.525
Uh, Silky short-weighted Tommy.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.327
I said something.

36:37.329 --> 36:38.628
He pushed me.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.830
Tommy pushed him...

36:40.832 --> 36:43.400
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.801
Did you ever at any time

36:44.803 --> 36:46.870
see your brother carry
or fire a gun?

36:46.872 --> 36:49.539
No, never.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.474
No further questions.

36:53.779 --> 36:55.912
Let's start
from the beginning, Abel.

36:55.914 --> 36:59.816
Isn't it true that your brother
was planning to buy a gun

36:59.818 --> 37:01.551
from Silky Ford
that night?

37:01.553 --> 37:03.420
Yeah, but he...

37:03.422 --> 37:05.355
He was planning
on buying a .357 Magnum?

37:05.357 --> 37:06.356
Yeah, but he...

37:06.358 --> 37:07.924
Just answer
yes or no, please.

37:07.926 --> 37:12.495
Your brother was a student
at Princeton University,

37:12.497 --> 37:13.496
is that right?
Objection, Your Honor.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.649
This has all been covered.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.801
I'm trying to establish
something important here,
Your Honor.

37:17.803 --> 37:21.571
We'll let Mr. Hillery
travel this road again.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.706
Overruled.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.808
HILLERY:
He was a student
at Princeton?

37:24.810 --> 37:25.809
ABEL:
Yes.

37:25.811 --> 37:27.844
HILLERY:
Were you proud of him?

37:27.846 --> 37:29.779
Everybody was.

37:29.781 --> 37:32.549
Everybody was. And you told
people all the time

37:32.551 --> 37:33.883
how proud you were of him?

37:33.885 --> 37:36.202
Of course
I did.

37:36.203 --> 37:38.520
Please tell the jury,
if you were so proud of him

37:38.523 --> 37:39.789
whether you would honestly admit

37:39.791 --> 37:42.826
that he was capable
of shooting a policeman.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.561
Objection, hypothetical.

37:44.563 --> 37:45.562
Sustained.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.597
No more of that, Mr. Hillery.

37:47.599 --> 37:53.870
Abel, were you in the alley
the night your brother was shot?

37:53.872 --> 37:55.538
You know I wasn't.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.941
So you don't know
what went on there, do you?

38:02.581 --> 38:03.580
Had to happen, Ben.

38:03.582 --> 38:04.781
You watch the jury?

38:04.783 --> 38:06.683
They didn't believe
a word he said.

38:06.685 --> 38:07.984
Freddo's going to walk.

38:07.986 --> 38:10.920
We could get Davis to roll
if Silky does.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.623
But Silky won't roll
unless he's set up

38:13.625 --> 38:14.924
for a felony.

38:20.599 --> 38:21.931
Set him up.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.833
Is that ethical?

38:23.835 --> 38:25.769
It's legal.

38:25.770 --> 38:27.704
In the criminal justice system,
that makes it ethical.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.606
Silky was committing a felony
that night.

38:29.608 --> 38:30.607
Half a pound of crack.

38:30.609 --> 38:31.875
He's a drug dealer.

38:31.877 --> 38:34.644
What do you think
happened in that alley?

38:34.646 --> 38:39.416
Best bet?
Freddo got trigger-happy.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.784
Shot the kid.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.787
Told Silky to take
the crack and run.

38:43.789 --> 38:45.655
Call Greevey and Logan.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.891
Set Silky up for sale weight.

38:50.862 --> 38:51.861
Hello, Silky.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.697
You're looking fine, baby.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.432
I thought with Tommy gone

38:55.434 --> 38:57.534
you'd be out
of business, though.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.703
Yeah, well, I got
other customers.

38:59.705 --> 39:00.804
The wire works.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.806
Thank God for small miracles.

39:02.808 --> 39:04.074
You got my rocks?

39:04.076 --> 39:05.508
You know it.

39:05.510 --> 39:06.976
A pound of the best.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.878
Five grand, baby.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.616
Countdown...

39:13.618 --> 39:14.818
<i> three...</i>

39:14.820 --> 39:15.919
<i> two...</i>

39:15.921 --> 39:17.921
Here, babe.

39:17.923 --> 39:18.922
Later.

39:18.924 --> 39:19.923
<i> One.</i>

39:19.925 --> 39:21.524
Go!

39:21.526 --> 39:22.826
Go, go, go.

39:22.828 --> 39:23.860
Freeze, police!

39:23.862 --> 39:25.095
I ain't moving!

39:25.097 --> 39:26.096
Don't move.

39:26.098 --> 39:27.964
(<i> siren approaching</i> )

39:27.966 --> 39:31.835
So are you going to protect me
for the next 30 years?

39:31.837 --> 39:34.671
STONE:
You're a predicate felon, Silky.

39:34.673 --> 39:38.007
You can get put away
for 15 years to life.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.613
Okay, sports fans.

39:43.615 --> 39:46.549
Let's go to the videotape.

39:46.551 --> 39:51.087
Did you see Freddo Parisi
shoot Tommy Richardson?

39:51.089 --> 39:53.690
Freddo says, "Don't move."

39:53.692 --> 39:56.793
Tommy turns
to say something and...

39:56.795 --> 39:58.595
the cop shoots him.

39:58.597 --> 40:00.864
Tommy didn't have no gun.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.966
Freddo takes my gun.

40:02.968 --> 40:04.601
He wipes it on his shirt.

40:04.603 --> 40:05.602
Twice.

40:05.604 --> 40:08.605
He puts it
in Tommy's hand.

40:08.607 --> 40:11.808
Freddo tells me
to take the dope and leave.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.643
Says it's my lucky day.

40:13.645 --> 40:14.944
Did he say anything else?

40:14.946 --> 40:16.146
Oh, yeah.

40:16.148 --> 40:19.582
He says if I tell anybody,
he'll kill me.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.718
At my cell
at the tombs,

40:21.720 --> 40:23.987
he tells me again.

40:23.989 --> 40:27.624
Keep your mouth shut
or you're dead.

40:27.626 --> 40:31.895
Even if I burn him,
his partner will get me.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.563
Well?

40:33.565 --> 40:37.634
You have five kids,
a terrific wife, nice house.

40:37.636 --> 40:39.536
Massapequa, isn't it?

40:39.538 --> 40:40.637
Yeah.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.038
You've earned
five or six citations.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.840
You have
a great record.

40:43.842 --> 40:46.910
Don't let misguided loyalty
ruin your life.

40:46.912 --> 40:49.913
You stay with Freddo,
he'll take you down.

40:49.915 --> 40:53.149
He's my partner.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.885
Something
you don't know.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.887
When they brought the Richardson
boy to the morgue,

40:57.889 --> 41:02.659
he had $3,000 on him.

41:02.661 --> 41:05.628
The transaction
never took place.

41:05.630 --> 41:08.031
He never bought Silky's gun.

41:11.136 --> 41:14.704
You weren't
even there.

41:19.811 --> 41:22.612
After the incident was called in
to Internal Affairs,

41:22.614 --> 41:24.848
what did Patrolman Parisi
tell you?

41:24.850 --> 41:29.118
He said if there was
ever a lineup,

41:29.120 --> 41:32.889
he didn't want me to identify
the guy with the birthmark.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.691
STONE:
Did he tell you why?

41:34.693 --> 41:36.960
DAVIS:
He said I didn't have to worry.

41:36.962 --> 41:41.798
If they picked him up,
he would say he wasn't there.

41:41.800 --> 41:46.236
Did Patrolman Parisi tell you
why he was so certain

41:46.238 --> 41:48.004
you didn't have
to worry?

41:50.075 --> 41:55.245
He said... he let him
take the crack.

41:55.247 --> 41:58.915
The stuff he was going to sell.

42:00.986 --> 42:02.986
Were you at all concerned

42:02.988 --> 42:05.955
that Patrolman Parisi
might be wrong?

42:05.957 --> 42:09.092
That the suspect in question
might admit

42:09.094 --> 42:11.194
to being there that night?

42:11.196 --> 42:12.829
No.

42:12.831 --> 42:16.833
Freddo...

42:16.835 --> 42:20.970
Patrolman Parisi said
it was a sure thing.

42:20.972 --> 42:23.907
The guy didn't dare
open his mouth.

42:23.909 --> 42:25.141
STONE:
No more questions.

42:25.143 --> 42:27.744
No questions
of this witness.

42:27.746 --> 42:29.012
JUDGE:
You may step down.

42:30.916 --> 42:33.783
Prosecution calls
Dorian "Silky" Ford.

42:33.785 --> 42:37.086
(<i> door opening</i> )

42:43.895 --> 42:46.763
JUDGE:
Mr. Stone, is this going
to take some time?

42:46.765 --> 42:48.465
Yes, Your Honor.

42:48.466 --> 42:50.166
JUDGE:
In view of how late
in the day it is,

42:50.168 --> 42:52.902
let's continue tomorrow.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.170
Any objections?

42:54.172 --> 42:56.239
Court is adjourned.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.016
Well, I can't say

43:07.018 --> 43:09.752
I'm not glad at the way
it turned out.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.087
I don't understand cops.

43:11.089 --> 43:14.190
There is such a thing
as an honorable mistake.

43:14.192 --> 43:15.925
Okay, he shot the kid.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.994
Did he have
to plant a gun on him?

43:17.996 --> 43:19.929
If he'd just admitted it

43:19.931 --> 43:21.965
and said, "I was scared.
I panicked. I was wrong."

43:21.967 --> 43:25.068
No jury in the world
would convict him of murder.

43:25.070 --> 43:27.504
If nothing else,

43:27.505 --> 43:29.939
Freddo will never have a gun
in his hand again.

43:29.941 --> 43:32.075
And that's better for everybody.

43:32.077 --> 43:38.314
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

43:38.316 --> 43:41.951
Schiff.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.287
Thanks for calling.

43:49.094 --> 43:52.228
Well, we don't have
to worry about a verdict.

43:53.898 --> 43:55.898
Freddo just ate his gun.

43:59.104 --> 44:08.011
THAYER:
Now is the time to remember
the real Tommy Richardson

44:08.013 --> 44:12.382
and what he meant
to this community.

44:12.384 --> 44:15.184
He was a symbol

44:15.186 --> 44:24.060
of what every child
born into poverty could achieve.

44:24.062 --> 44:28.231
He gave back to his people,

44:28.233 --> 44:34.370
his time, his energy,

44:34.372 --> 44:38.274
his love.

44:38.276 --> 44:42.979
And he tried to help even more.

44:42.981 --> 44:49.385
He tried to help others
by giving money,

44:49.387 --> 44:55.892
but to get that money,
he sold drugs.

44:55.894 --> 45:02.965
And he was shot to death
in the gutter because of it.

45:02.967 --> 45:09.972
What Tommy Richardson wanted
to do for his people was right,

45:09.974 --> 45:13.209
but he did it the wrong way.

45:13.211 --> 45:18.915
And the policeman who shot him--

45:18.917 --> 45:22.051
that was wrong, too.

45:22.053 --> 45:29.258
But it would not have happened
without drugs.

45:36.034 --> 45:39.902
Wandering the halls?

45:39.904 --> 45:44.974
I wanted
to say thank you.

45:44.976 --> 45:47.376
I know this was a tough one.

45:47.378 --> 45:49.412
It's the last one.

45:49.414 --> 45:51.214
No more cops.

45:51.216 --> 45:53.282
It's too hard.

45:55.220 --> 45:58.287
Know why I wouldn't let go?

45:58.289 --> 46:02.258
Because there
but for the grace of God, go I

46:02.260 --> 46:04.026
or any cop.

46:04.028 --> 46:06.229
You get caught.

46:06.231 --> 46:09.465
You get prosecuted.

46:09.467 --> 46:13.202
Didn't know
you were a philosopher, Max.

46:13.204 --> 46:13.235
Just an ex-altar boy with a gun.
