00:01.750 --> 00:04.166
<i>Bavmorda's spirit survived.</i>

00:04.166 --> 00:06.666
In me, in your brother, and in you.

00:07.333 --> 00:08.833
<i>Be careful.</i>

00:13.833 --> 00:14.916
<i>The prince is alive.</i>

00:14.916 --> 00:16.458
<i>A prisoner of the Withered Crone,</i>

00:16.458 --> 00:20.166
<i>who dwells in the Immemorial City
that lies beyond the Shattered Sea.</i>

00:20.750 --> 00:22.916
Bone Reavers! Ride!

00:24.166 --> 00:26.625
Boorman,
you're supposed to be dead.

00:26.625 --> 00:28.750
You're thinkin' of someone else.

00:29.583 --> 00:30.916
Ha!

00:30.916 --> 00:33.166
<i>My family
was headed to the Mothers' Gate.</i>

00:33.166 --> 00:34.791
<i>I was the only one that survived.</i>

00:36.291 --> 00:38.125
JADE'S MOTHER: <i>Jade, run!</i>

00:40.458 --> 00:42.000
<i>What happened to Ballantine</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:43.625
<i>is gonna happen to me.</i>

00:44.291 --> 00:45.916
And you guys are gonna have to stop me.

00:45.916 --> 00:48.083
<i>What was Ballantine gonna do to me?</i>

00:48.083 --> 00:50.291
<i>What Bavmorda started
when you were a baby.</i>

00:50.875 --> 00:52.666
<i>The Ritual
of the Thirteenth Night.</i>

00:52.666 --> 00:55.250
<i>Banishing your soul
to a realm of perpetual suffering.</i>

00:58.458 --> 00:59.750
<i>Furrock!</i>

01:01.000 --> 01:02.916
<i>You can still save him.</i>

01:02.916 --> 01:05.125
- <i>I don't know how.</i>
- <i>Yes, you do.</i>

01:11.208 --> 01:13.000
<i>Take the girl.</i>

01:15.333 --> 01:16.458
<i>Kill the others.</i>

02:03.958 --> 02:05.125
Ah!

02:32.666 --> 02:34.375
What the hell is that?

02:34.375 --> 02:35.500
Don't worry about it.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.125
How long
can they keep this up for?

02:57.125 --> 03:00.583
The Crone won't let them rest
till they have Elora and have killed us.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.250
If only they took the time
to get to know us.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.458
Where to now, Captain?

03:03.458 --> 03:06.583
We can't outrun them,
so where can we go?

03:10.708 --> 03:12.125
Into the Wildwood.

03:12.708 --> 03:15.750
But, what about the, you know,
perils of the Wildwood?

03:15.750 --> 03:16.833
What perils?

03:16.833 --> 03:20.708
People say there's something in the air,
the trees, the water, that makes you...

03:20.708 --> 03:21.916
Never wanna leave.

03:21.916 --> 03:23.708
Lose your will to do anything.

03:23.708 --> 03:26.541
Trust me. We are not spending
any more time in there than we need to.

03:26.541 --> 03:27.625
Yeah, no way.

03:27.625 --> 03:30.791
If anybody has any better ideas,
I'm sure we'd all love to hear them.

03:34.333 --> 03:35.583
Run!

03:37.833 --> 03:39.083
Go!

04:07.291 --> 04:08.333
Key is vigilance.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.166
Stay sharp.

04:11.083 --> 04:13.250
The Wildwood is seductive,

04:13.250 --> 04:15.625
it lures you in
with its sights and sounds.

04:16.291 --> 04:17.541
The next thing you know,

04:18.125 --> 04:22.416
you're officiating weddings
and dog-sitting for casual acquaintances.

04:23.416 --> 04:25.083
Well, that's not gonna happen.

04:26.708 --> 04:29.416
Personally,
I'm still worried about the perils.

05:14.625 --> 05:17.375
The Bone Reavers that killed my family
fled into the Wildwood.

05:19.958 --> 05:21.708
Maybe they're still here...

05:23.916 --> 05:24.916
somewhere.

05:25.708 --> 05:29.166
This wand is a splinter
from the Great Tree

05:29.166 --> 05:30.791
at the center of all things.

05:31.583 --> 05:34.625
Can I just, you know, try it?

05:34.625 --> 05:37.208
To see if it even works for me.
Maybe it won't.

05:37.208 --> 05:38.375
It will.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.333
But you're not ready.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.458
There's a strict system
of magical pedagogy...

05:42.458 --> 05:43.541
Ew...

05:43.541 --> 05:45.500
It means wisdom or knowledge.

05:45.500 --> 05:49.750
Before you can wield this wand,
you must master the four pillars of...

05:49.750 --> 05:53.708
I grew the eckleberry bush,
which, apparently, was amazing.

05:54.500 --> 05:58.000
And we made that salve
and, you know, cured Graydon.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.500
Probably.

06:02.625 --> 06:05.291
Now, I just have to ace
concentration and divination.

06:05.291 --> 06:06.708
No sweat.

06:07.375 --> 06:12.166
Divination, interpreting the vibrations
of the universe, and seeing the future,

06:12.166 --> 06:14.791
nearly impossible for even
the most accomplished sorcerer.

06:15.791 --> 06:17.083
Can you divinate?

06:17.666 --> 06:20.500
On occasion, I have been known
to see visions of things to come.

06:21.291 --> 06:22.375
Was I in them?

06:25.166 --> 06:27.416
Well, let's start with concentration.

06:28.375 --> 06:31.708
With proper focus,
something you don't have...

06:31.708 --> 06:33.083
I'm trying.

06:33.083 --> 06:37.541
You can move objects with your mind,
manipulate elemental forces,

06:37.541 --> 06:39.833
even transform people.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.416
What? What are you doing?

06:45.416 --> 06:51.166
I'm using my mind
to remove that stick from your butt

06:51.166 --> 06:54.916
and transform you into someone
who will let me use the wand.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.166
- Is it working?
- No.

07:01.333 --> 07:04.708
In the wrong hands, Cherlindrea's wand is
a powerful instrument

07:04.708 --> 07:06.583
of unimaginable destruction.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.250
Got the ghoulies, huh?

07:15.250 --> 07:16.500
What?

07:16.500 --> 07:20.500
The ghoulies. You know,
little bugs buzzin' around your head,

07:20.500 --> 07:24.416
telling you to steal some flowers,
pass gas quietly, if at all,

07:24.416 --> 07:26.166
generally make a fool of yourself

07:26.166 --> 07:28.916
in front of a certain fair-haired,
doe-eyed chosen one

07:28.916 --> 07:30.875
who, maybe, thinks of you
as more of a friend.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.458
I don't have
the ghoulies.

07:32.458 --> 07:33.958
Okay. Great.

07:33.958 --> 07:36.750
Means I don't have to show you
how to get her to like you back.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.958
I mean, is that even something
you would know about?

07:39.625 --> 07:42.416
Graydon, bubby,

07:43.416 --> 07:45.875
women are
the central preoccupation of my life.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.500
And many a knee weakens and pulse quickens

07:49.500 --> 07:52.625
at the mere mention
of Thraxus "Relaxus"...

07:52.625 --> 07:55.041
Boorman, you cheddar-headed goob.

07:55.041 --> 07:58.000
If this turns out to be
another one of your side quests,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.291
so help me,
I'm going to cut out your heart.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.375
See that? Passion it evokes?

08:05.500 --> 08:09.375
Yeah, but how do you do it?
How do you get that passion?

08:12.333 --> 08:14.291
Okay, first of all,

08:14.291 --> 08:17.416
the most important thing
to understand about the fairer sex,

08:17.416 --> 08:21.000
and this is gonna sound counterintuitive,
but trust me, it's true.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.500
- Okay.
- They love it, they love it when you...

08:29.625 --> 08:31.333
When you what?

08:31.333 --> 08:34.083
Boorman, what do they love?

08:34.083 --> 08:36.708
No, no. Boorman, finish that sentence.
What do they love?

08:36.708 --> 08:38.333
- I'm not joking.
- Listen, guys.

08:39.333 --> 08:44.208
I know you all have your doubts
about my integrity, motives, whatever,

08:44.208 --> 08:46.625
but I'm begging you to trust me
when I tell you that,

08:46.625 --> 08:49.416
no matter what happens next,
I have a plan,

08:49.916 --> 08:52.625
and everything will work out
if you all just remain...

08:55.250 --> 08:56.333
...calm.

09:34.833 --> 09:36.083
Boorman.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.166
Lori.

09:37.625 --> 09:39.291
Toth's first name is Lori,

09:39.291 --> 09:41.333
but, for some reason,
he's insecure about it.

09:41.333 --> 09:44.000
Yeah, own it, Lori.
You know, make it yours.

09:44.916 --> 09:48.583
Now, now, boys. Play nice.

09:52.541 --> 09:54.041
You don't look dead.

09:54.625 --> 09:55.625
Funny story.

09:56.833 --> 09:58.000
Well, not ha-ha funny.

09:58.875 --> 10:02.375
More like a "ain't life funny"
kind of funny.

10:03.208 --> 10:06.041
You can imagine my surprise
when Toth came back

10:06.041 --> 10:08.958
and said he'd run down
a Tir Asleen cutout,

10:08.958 --> 10:14.958
four kids, and a beanpole
that looked exactly like Thraxus Boorman.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.833
You are entitled to an explanation.

10:18.833 --> 10:21.125
No one gets out of Skellin alive.

10:22.166 --> 10:23.166
Ever.

10:23.166 --> 10:25.041
- Skellin?
- Dread Mines of Skellin.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.208
In the mountains. Run by the Trolls.

10:27.208 --> 10:30.958
What can I say? I guess that makes me
the somebody who did.

10:32.041 --> 10:33.416
I'm going to enjoy this.

10:33.416 --> 10:36.000
Well, if you're thinkin'
what I'm thinkin' you're thinkin,

10:36.000 --> 10:37.083
so am I.

10:37.083 --> 10:39.041
I doubt that very much.

10:40.625 --> 10:42.875
Take him to my tent
and make sure he's well tied up.

10:44.833 --> 10:47.958
I don't know. See, that kind of
sounds like we're on the same page.

10:49.041 --> 10:50.041
And the others?

10:50.041 --> 10:51.250
Do you want 'em,

10:51.250 --> 10:54.666
or should we just fire up
the old skull-boiling cauldron?

10:57.750 --> 11:01.708
I'm Kit Tanthalos of Tir Asleen.
I'm Queen Sorsha's daughter.

11:01.708 --> 11:03.000
Scorpia.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
Well, actually, it's Her Sublime Eminence,
Mistress Magnificūs Venoma Scorpia,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.375
but Scorpia's fine.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.916
My brother was abducted from our castle.

11:13.916 --> 11:15.208
Wasn't us.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.875
- Wasn't, was it?
- Mm-mmm.

11:17.875 --> 11:19.583
It was servants of the Withered Crone.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.958
We're going beyond the Shattered Sea.

11:26.541 --> 11:28.166
To rescue him.

11:29.208 --> 11:32.750
If you could find it in your hearts
to let us go,

11:32.750 --> 11:34.708
I am sure my mother would repay the favor.

11:34.708 --> 11:39.583
And you can keep Boorman.
He's, like, the worst.

11:39.583 --> 11:41.166
You're wasting your breath.

11:41.833 --> 11:43.958
They don't have
a whit of mercy about them,

11:44.541 --> 11:47.583
and they're too stupid to realize
what you're offering them.

11:47.583 --> 11:50.750
Maybe we won't fire up
the ol' skull pot just yet.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.958
Lock the Nelwyn and the pretty fella
down in the Borough.

11:58.958 --> 12:00.333
- Gently.
- Okay.

12:00.333 --> 12:03.208
- Toss these two in the Rattler.
- Wait.

12:03.208 --> 12:04.583
But keep this one here.

12:04.583 --> 12:06.666
- What'll you do to her?
- She'll make good sport.

12:06.666 --> 12:08.583
Jade!

12:10.083 --> 12:14.041
Firstly,
can I just say, you look wowza.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.458
Haven't aged a day in...
What's it been, 80 moons?

12:17.458 --> 12:18.791
You have.

12:19.916 --> 12:24.291
I remember a lean, hungry kid,
so eager to please.

12:24.291 --> 12:25.958
Still eager to please.

12:27.541 --> 12:29.208
I thought you were dead.

12:31.916 --> 12:33.000
I wept.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.125
Like, a lot or just...

12:37.208 --> 12:38.708
Huh. Great shot!

12:38.708 --> 12:40.791
I was aiming a touch higher.

12:44.708 --> 12:46.333
What happened to you?

12:52.958 --> 12:55.125
- Alone at last, huh?
- Hmm?

12:55.125 --> 12:57.416
No, uh, you're right. I just...

12:58.166 --> 13:00.500
It's good to spend
a little one-on-one time together.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.416
Without the constant interruption
of the groupthink.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.791
We are not spending
one-on-one time together.

13:05.791 --> 13:09.833
- We're trying to find a way out of here.
- Sure, yeah, of course.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.375
It's just training, um, with Elora
takes up a lot of your time.

13:14.375 --> 13:18.625
Speakin' of which, do you think
that she's ignoring me? A little?

13:18.625 --> 13:20.625
You tried to exile her
into another dimension.

13:21.666 --> 13:23.208
In my experience, ladies tend to be

13:23.208 --> 13:25.416
a little less trusting
after that sort of thing.

13:25.416 --> 13:27.250
Right, but... but I'm not that guy.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.500
I was just briefly possessed by that guy,

13:29.500 --> 13:32.666
which is unfortunate, 'cause I feel like
we had a connection, and I...

13:32.791 --> 13:35.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold it right there, Graydon.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.041
She is Elora Danan,
Empress of the Nine Realms,

13:38.041 --> 13:39.791
destined to save the world.

13:39.791 --> 13:42.083
She doesn't have time
to connect with you or anyone else.

13:42.083 --> 13:43.833
So you're saying

13:43.833 --> 13:47.250
saving the world and having a relationship
are mutually exclusive?

13:47.250 --> 13:50.416
You've gotta find a balance
between personal and professional.

13:50.416 --> 13:51.541
Exactly.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.125
What am I saying? No. I mean, yes.

13:54.791 --> 13:57.291
You've gotta stop
thinkin' about her in that way.

13:57.875 --> 13:59.875
Well, what if I can't, Willow?

13:59.875 --> 14:03.333
Well, you have to... be kidding me.

14:11.458 --> 14:12.833
What is that?

14:12.833 --> 14:14.458
It's Brownies.

14:23.250 --> 14:26.083
Oh, what are they gonna do to her?

14:26.083 --> 14:29.500
- I'm sure she'll be okay.
- How could you possibly be sure of that?

14:29.500 --> 14:31.541
I don't know.
It's just a thing people say.

14:31.541 --> 14:33.458
They wear people's skulls as masks!

14:35.291 --> 14:37.833
And they're gonna kill her.

14:37.833 --> 14:42.083
You know, I believe that love is
the most powerful force in the universe.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.333
Wait, what?

14:44.333 --> 14:48.250
I said love is the most powerful force
in the universe.

14:48.250 --> 14:50.416
That's how I know we're gonna save Airk.

14:51.166 --> 14:53.083
- Are you kidding?
- No?

14:53.791 --> 14:58.208
My best friend is being tortured right now
and you're talking to me about love?

14:58.208 --> 15:00.458
I'm just saying,
I know what you're going through.

15:01.083 --> 15:04.916
Oh, right, 'cause you rolled around
in the grass with my brother a few times?

15:04.916 --> 15:07.291
Jade is my...

15:10.416 --> 15:12.333
We're friends.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.541
Come on. You see the way
that she looks at you,

15:14.541 --> 15:19.958
protects you, frets over you,
came with us 'cause of you.

15:19.958 --> 15:23.958
We pretend not to know, sometimes even
convince ourselves we don't know,

15:24.791 --> 15:26.416
but deep down, we know.

15:28.125 --> 15:29.916
I feel sorry for her.

15:31.375 --> 15:33.791
For loving someone
who can't love her back.

15:43.208 --> 15:47.791
You don't know
the first thing about her, or me.

15:47.791 --> 15:52.000
Maybe not. But I know how
we're gonna get out of here.

15:54.833 --> 15:56.000
With this.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.875
How did you get out of Skellin?

16:00.500 --> 16:01.708
The only way I could.

16:03.791 --> 16:05.416
I fought my way out.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.833
<i>Once I sated my bloodlust,</i>

16:12.958 --> 16:14.958
<i>I descended the face of that mountain.</i>

16:17.625 --> 16:20.208
<i>Wounded, freezing.</i>

16:21.708 --> 16:24.333
All that mattered was getting back here.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.958
And I would've made it, too,

16:41.958 --> 16:46.000
if I hadn't stopped to assist
those stranded travelers.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.958
- Hey, sugar buns.
- Hi.

16:49.458 --> 16:52.458
<i>How was I to know
they were Carcosian Death Dealers?</i>

16:52.458 --> 16:55.875
<i>And sure, they spared my life,
but they forced me to do...</i>

16:55.875 --> 16:57.083
Come on, come on!

16:57.083 --> 16:58.333
<i>...terrible things.</i>

16:58.333 --> 16:59.750
Come on! Let's go!

16:59.750 --> 17:01.208
<i>I was framed as a criminal.</i>

17:04.958 --> 17:08.458
<i>I was on the run for years
before they finally captured me.</i>

17:09.083 --> 17:13.416
Sorsha negotiated
to send me back to Tir Asleen,

17:14.041 --> 17:19.750
<i>and employing my not inconsiderable
powers of persuasion,</i>

17:20.958 --> 17:22.916
<i>I convinced her to set me free.</i>

17:23.041 --> 17:25.791
<i>You remember my powers?</i>

17:25.791 --> 17:29.125
Mmm. Not inconsiderable.

17:31.500 --> 17:34.666
The relic? You didn't find it?

17:38.083 --> 17:41.791
And the others? Allagash?

17:42.833 --> 17:44.250
Trolls got him.

17:45.500 --> 17:50.208
I only hope he suffered
as much as possible

17:50.208 --> 17:51.750
before they killed him.

17:53.541 --> 17:55.333
Long story.

18:01.625 --> 18:03.083
And Madmartigan?

18:05.958 --> 18:07.333
They got him, too?

18:10.666 --> 18:12.666
Hello, sorry to disturb you.

18:15.375 --> 18:18.625
You oughta be.
You have any idea what time it is?

18:18.625 --> 18:21.916
- Hey! Keep it down over there!
- Gordon, so help me!

18:21.916 --> 18:25.333
Uh, I'm looking for some old friends
of mine. Perhaps, you might know them.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.500
- Why would I know them?
- They're Brownies.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.583
And I suppose all Nelwyn in the world
know each other?

18:30.583 --> 18:33.166
Do you have any idea
how offensive that is?

18:35.250 --> 18:36.666
Willow!

18:36.666 --> 18:40.458
Rool! Am I glad to see you.
It's been years.

18:40.458 --> 18:42.375
I thought I would never see you again!

18:42.375 --> 18:47.958
You look... What is it? Bigger, yes?

18:48.500 --> 18:52.583
You met my daughter, Ganush.
Ganush, Willow!

18:52.958 --> 18:54.083
Huh.

18:57.291 --> 18:58.833
She's at that rude age.

18:59.375 --> 19:00.666
Where's Franjean?

19:00.666 --> 19:04.291
- Uh, sadly, no longer with us.
- Oh...

19:04.291 --> 19:06.375
Headed south. Said it was for the weather,

19:06.375 --> 19:09.333
but we know
it's because his wife left him. For me.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.666
Sadly, she's no longer with us either.

19:11.666 --> 19:13.125
- Dead.
- Further south.

19:13.708 --> 19:17.666
Now this one, she wants to move upstairs,
live with the Bone Reavers,

19:17.666 --> 19:21.208
- probably get taken in a Troll raid.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

19:21.208 --> 19:23.583
What I would like...

19:23.583 --> 19:25.708
is for you to get off your ass,
and get a job,

19:25.708 --> 19:27.166
have a hobby, do something!

19:27.166 --> 19:29.750
She just wants to be famous.
Now, they all want to be famous.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.625
- For what? I don't know.
- Decoupage!

19:32.208 --> 19:33.416
Rool, I need your help.

19:33.958 --> 19:34.958
Like old times?

19:34.958 --> 19:37.250
Well, sorta. Uh, Elora's up there.

19:37.250 --> 19:39.000
- The baby!
- Not anymore.

19:39.125 --> 19:41.125
We need to help
our friends get outta here.

19:41.125 --> 19:45.916
- We're on a very important quest.
- Well, as long as it's important.

19:45.916 --> 19:49.750
If it was a frivolous quest,
I would have to refuse to help you.

19:49.750 --> 19:52.750
- Can you help us with the Bone Reavers?
- Well, the thing is,

19:52.750 --> 19:54.833
they don't listen to us so much.

19:54.833 --> 19:56.833
They set camp right above us.

19:56.833 --> 19:58.666
- Like, very humiliating.
- Eh.

19:58.666 --> 20:02.500
But we still do great diversions.
You remember the owls and the stink bombs?

20:02.500 --> 20:03.583
Not really.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.083
Well, we can do better.

20:05.083 --> 20:09.500
With Cherlindrea's wand,
we can create far superior diversions.

20:11.958 --> 20:13.958
Oh, crap.

20:14.541 --> 20:18.375
I think it's...
Pretty sure it's...

20:20.500 --> 20:25.250
<i>Avag gahdu?</i>

20:28.625 --> 20:30.666
Are you just making that up?

20:33.083 --> 20:34.916
Maybe now.

20:34.916 --> 20:36.791
<i>Avag gahdu.</i>

20:39.375 --> 20:41.833
- Well, that can't be good.
- No, it cannot.

20:44.958 --> 20:45.958
Go!

20:49.541 --> 20:53.250
You ensorcelled me with your sarcasm
and your magnificent beard!

20:54.583 --> 20:55.583
Not intentionally!

20:57.458 --> 21:01.625
We don't wanna hurt anybody,
and nobody wants to get hurt.

21:01.625 --> 21:04.458
I will hurt you, if I have to.

21:04.458 --> 21:06.083
Hurt you bad.

21:06.083 --> 21:08.041
All we want is Jade.

21:09.375 --> 21:10.416
Where is she?

21:10.416 --> 21:11.625
I'm here.

21:17.708 --> 21:18.708
Cut her loose.

21:21.458 --> 21:23.166
Afraid we can't do that.

21:23.166 --> 21:25.666
Not without the mistress's say-so.

21:26.416 --> 21:29.083
I will melt your face off, Lori!

21:30.375 --> 21:34.250
We have a sayin'
about people who make empty threats.

21:34.875 --> 21:37.291
They make nice hats.

21:50.791 --> 21:52.833
I applaud your spirit, Princess,

21:53.375 --> 21:57.708
but you really must loosen up,
have some fun.

22:02.208 --> 22:03.333
You'd make a decent...

22:04.916 --> 22:06.500
I'm lots of fun,

22:06.500 --> 22:08.541
and I've been
waiting for this for a long time.

22:09.125 --> 22:11.791
Oh, gorgeous, I'm all yours.

22:25.833 --> 22:26.958
No, Jade, no!

22:34.041 --> 22:35.041
No!

22:35.458 --> 22:36.750
Come on!

22:42.375 --> 22:45.916
Jade! Stop! Please, please! No!

22:50.291 --> 22:51.833
Please!

22:58.375 --> 22:59.833
Take her to my tent.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.250
Finished.

23:10.041 --> 23:13.625
You see that large rock
that looks like a cow with two heads?

23:13.625 --> 23:14.791
Uh-huh.

23:14.791 --> 23:17.166
Do not go that way. That is the wrong way.

23:17.166 --> 23:20.333
But if sad-angry frown-Prince
runs that way,

23:21.041 --> 23:23.125
- they will follow him.
- Well, that's not a plan.

23:23.125 --> 23:25.916
Well, you rejected
all the giant owl ideas,

23:25.916 --> 23:27.375
so this is what you've got.

23:27.375 --> 23:30.125
No, no, it's good. Simple.

23:31.583 --> 23:34.208
All we need is a bit of luck
and a few moments to get in,

23:34.208 --> 23:37.000
set 'em free, lead them to the trees,
and meet up with you.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.458
All right, let's do this.

23:40.541 --> 23:42.666
- I know the feeling.
- Just like old times.

23:42.666 --> 23:47.458
Before we sunk into an inescapable morass
of soul-crushing domesticity.

23:47.458 --> 23:54.125
Zing, attack, running, horses, mayhem,
mayhem, happy-kissy ending.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.083
All right, hop in.

23:56.083 --> 23:58.708
Nah, I left those days behind.

23:58.708 --> 24:03.333
These days, I like to snack, reminisce,
a little more snack,

24:03.333 --> 24:06.041
- spend time with Ganush.
- You're smothering me.

24:06.041 --> 24:08.083
But, Rool, I can't do this without you.

24:08.666 --> 24:11.625
No, you can. You have him now.

24:12.166 --> 24:14.416
He is your new Franjean and Rool.

24:14.416 --> 24:18.333
And though he may look like
a sad-angry frown-Prince,

24:18.333 --> 24:22.250
he has a hero's heart, like you.

24:22.250 --> 24:26.125
To adventure is dangerous,
but if you don't die,

24:26.125 --> 24:28.375
one day you may truly live.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.625
That mark on your neck,
where'd you get it?

24:39.625 --> 24:41.791
I don't know. I've always had it.

24:47.041 --> 24:49.875
Here,
by the child's a hundredth day,

24:49.875 --> 24:51.791
they get seared with it's family's mark,

24:52.583 --> 24:54.625
so they remember where they came from.

24:55.583 --> 24:59.500
This is my father's mark.
The mark of Kael.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.166
- General Kael?
- You've heard of him?

25:04.833 --> 25:06.833
He was the first Bone Reaver.

25:07.666 --> 25:09.708
He had fifteen children.

25:10.958 --> 25:15.125
You and I are the only ones left.

25:15.708 --> 25:18.166
My father was a free man,
killed by your people.

25:18.166 --> 25:21.083
He was killed by Madmartigan
at the Battle of Nockmaar.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.458
Your mother was killed by the rangers

25:23.458 --> 25:25.583
that kidnapped you
and took you to Tir Asleen.

25:27.708 --> 25:29.375
No, I... I remember.

25:30.583 --> 25:31.875
So do I.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.500
I remember that you used to count
the stars before you went to sleep

25:38.500 --> 25:40.875
to make sure there was just as many
up there

25:40.875 --> 25:44.000
- as the night before.
- Kael served Bavmorda.

25:45.083 --> 25:46.791
Bavmorda served the Crone.

25:47.375 --> 25:50.000
Bavmorda made a pact
with the slaves of Galladoorn.

25:51.166 --> 25:54.666
She'd help them overthrow their masters
in exchange for their loyalty.

25:56.041 --> 25:58.541
People do whatever's necessary to be free.

26:00.625 --> 26:03.958
And after? When Nockmaar fell?

26:05.333 --> 26:07.375
Those who survived, fled.

26:08.541 --> 26:13.250
The armies of Tir Asleen and Galladoorn,
they pursued us. They feared us.

26:13.958 --> 26:15.250
As they should.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.916
Sooner or later, we rise up.

26:19.375 --> 26:20.750
Why take me with them?

26:20.750 --> 26:23.958
What better way to prevent an uprising
than to steal their future,

26:24.958 --> 26:28.458
raise children to believe
their captors are their saviors?

26:29.000 --> 26:32.125
Make them loyal, make them soldiers.

26:39.500 --> 26:40.791
You hear that?

26:40.916 --> 26:44.208
Mmm. Big drums. Never a good sign.

26:44.208 --> 26:46.500
Willow, we have to hurry.
We have to save Elora.

26:46.500 --> 26:50.083
And my fiancée and the other people.

26:50.083 --> 26:51.958
- Focus!
- Ow!

26:51.958 --> 26:53.750
We've no idea what we're walking into.

26:53.750 --> 26:56.000
I need you thinking with your head,
not your...

26:56.000 --> 26:58.750
- Heart?
- Exactly. Come on, this way.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.000
Okay.

27:07.541 --> 27:08.750
Grab the weapons.

27:11.875 --> 27:12.916
Got 'em.

27:16.250 --> 27:18.208
It appears we've yet to be detected.

27:18.208 --> 27:21.500
Did you cast, like, a invisibility charm
on us or something?

27:21.500 --> 27:25.041
I think what's actually happening
is that they really don't care about us.

27:25.541 --> 27:29.458
Still, don't let your guard down.
We could be set upon at any moment.

27:29.458 --> 27:31.250
Willow!

27:32.875 --> 27:35.458
Uh, Elora,
thank the Mothers you're all right.

27:36.916 --> 27:37.916
Graydon.

27:38.291 --> 27:41.708
Elora, you... you look well.

27:42.958 --> 27:45.583
- Where are the others?
- Oh, they're around somewhere.

27:45.583 --> 27:46.791
Dinner's gonna be ready.

27:46.791 --> 27:49.000
- What is going on?
- They invited you to dinner?

27:49.000 --> 27:52.833
Jade's a Bone Reaver.
I don't know what that makes her now.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.416
Conflicted, I imagine.

27:55.416 --> 27:59.208
Anyway, they're throwing a party
to celebrate her return. Come on.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.000
Elora...

28:06.791 --> 28:09.375
I feel like it's still too cumin-y.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.166
Am I crazy?

28:15.000 --> 28:18.500
No, you're not crazy, Toth. You just have
a very well-developed palate.

28:19.333 --> 28:20.750
You can call me Lori.

28:24.583 --> 28:26.500
<i>Lochtor tuatha.</i>

28:29.250 --> 28:31.750
What are you doing? Give me the wand.

28:31.875 --> 28:33.625
Ugh. You're such a dad.

28:33.625 --> 28:35.375
Lori, do you mind?

28:35.375 --> 28:37.625
No, help yourself.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.250
Oh, don't wipe it on that.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.625
It's my special party rag,
it's fine.

29:03.458 --> 29:05.125
Looks like you've done all right.

29:06.458 --> 29:10.875
I told you, everything
would be all right. I have a plan.

29:13.375 --> 29:15.208
Slaves of Galladoorn,

29:15.208 --> 29:17.166
conscripts of Nockmaar,

29:17.166 --> 29:20.000
outlaws of the Wildwood.

29:22.500 --> 29:25.375
All we have ever wanted is our freedom.

29:25.375 --> 29:27.958
That our children
would not have to live in fear.

29:27.958 --> 29:30.250
They'd serve no master...

29:30.250 --> 29:33.208
Daikini or Troll or Crone.

29:33.208 --> 29:37.583
We have no Barrier to hide behind,
no army to defend us.

29:37.583 --> 29:40.875
All we have is the fear
that our masks evoke,

29:40.875 --> 29:43.000
the determination to survive...

29:44.375 --> 29:45.958
and each other.

29:48.458 --> 29:53.458
Today, after two hundred moons,
my sister has come home.

29:56.958 --> 30:02.541
She grew up in Tir Asleen,
was fed lies about us, and about herself.

30:03.291 --> 30:07.500
But tonight, she is reborn,
bathed in the love of her family

30:07.500 --> 30:09.625
and the values that we still fight for.

30:10.125 --> 30:14.166
Freedom, rebellion, passion, and joy.

30:14.166 --> 30:16.125
Till the break of dawn!

30:24.875 --> 30:26.083
What is it?

30:26.083 --> 30:28.583
I don't know. Delicious-looking fruit.
Live a little.

30:38.583 --> 30:39.625
Ooh.

31:05.166 --> 31:07.541
Yes, yes!

31:40.208 --> 31:44.083
I missed you. My baby sister.

31:49.333 --> 31:52.666
Is it... Is it good?

31:52.666 --> 31:54.333
It's okay.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.041
You look like a boy.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.041
- Do you think she'll like it?
- Who?

31:58.041 --> 32:02.000
No one. Just this...
Uh. (CLEARS THROAT) This girl.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.916
Oh...

32:03.916 --> 32:05.625
Women like beards.

32:06.583 --> 32:09.125
Kind of wish
you'd have told us that before.

32:09.125 --> 32:11.250
Kind of wish you'd told me before.

32:12.291 --> 32:13.916
I mean, this guy doesn't have a beard.

32:13.916 --> 32:16.041
That guy doesn't have a girlfriend.

32:50.375 --> 32:52.500
I believe I left you tied up in my room.

32:53.083 --> 32:54.291
Well, I got lonely.

32:57.666 --> 32:59.916
What am I going to do with you?

33:01.166 --> 33:04.000
I could have come back, but I didn't.

33:05.583 --> 33:06.958
I was ashamed.

33:09.166 --> 33:10.458
Stay.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.750
Someday I'd like to.

33:14.958 --> 33:18.666
I could make you stay, you know?
Make you my prisoner.

33:19.250 --> 33:21.416
Scorpia, don't you know?

33:24.166 --> 33:25.500
I already am.

33:38.875 --> 33:40.083
How you feeling?

33:40.083 --> 33:44.750
Weird. But good.
What about you?

33:44.750 --> 33:47.000
Weird.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.916
That's truth plums for you, I guess.

33:48.916 --> 33:50.666
Those are what plums?

33:50.666 --> 33:52.166
The truth plums.

33:52.166 --> 33:55.125
The fruit that was handed out
when Scorpia did her speech.

33:56.083 --> 33:59.625
Once you eat them, it's impossible
to be anything but totally honest.

33:59.750 --> 34:01.500
Oh, right.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.166
I didn't know that.

34:06.750 --> 34:08.125
But now I do.

34:10.166 --> 34:11.375
So...

34:13.041 --> 34:14.125
You're a...

34:14.125 --> 34:16.125
Yeah. I guess.

34:17.208 --> 34:19.208
Still can't quite believe it.

34:20.708 --> 34:22.458
Why did Sorsha lie to me?

34:26.541 --> 34:28.625
Maybe she thought she was protecting you.

34:30.375 --> 34:31.666
Did you know?

34:32.500 --> 34:34.041
No.

34:35.458 --> 34:36.833
But I...

34:37.750 --> 34:39.083
I suspected.

34:40.208 --> 34:43.291
And you didn't tell me?

34:43.750 --> 34:45.458
Well, what was I supposed to say?

34:45.458 --> 34:48.333
That I have a funny feeling
you might, in fact, be the very thing

34:48.333 --> 34:49.500
you vowed to destroy?

34:49.958 --> 34:51.958
At best, you would've thought I was crazy.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.583
And at worst,
it would've broken your heart.

34:56.250 --> 34:59.041
Well, you're certainly the expert
on breaking my heart.

35:02.958 --> 35:04.083
Jade, wait.

35:12.125 --> 35:15.958
I, um, felt like we were making progress,
and then that thing happened.

35:15.958 --> 35:18.666
And now, you feel uncomfortable with me,
and I get it.

35:18.666 --> 35:20.791
- I tried to banish you to another realm...
- Hey.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.625
Oh, you shaved.

35:24.625 --> 35:26.291
Huh? Oh.

35:26.416 --> 35:28.500
Yeah, I guess I did.

35:29.166 --> 35:31.458
- Who were you talking to?
- No one.

35:32.333 --> 35:34.625
I was actually just about
to come and find you.

35:34.625 --> 35:36.208
I wanted to reassure you

35:37.000 --> 35:39.625
that what happened at Nockmaar,
that wasn't me.

35:39.625 --> 35:42.291
- I would never...
- I saw you kill your brother.

35:43.291 --> 35:44.375
When?

35:44.375 --> 35:47.833
When I kiss...
When I pulled it out of you.

35:50.250 --> 35:54.083
I told you I was sick as a kid. Possessed.

35:56.583 --> 36:02.833
My brother was my hero
and I loved him more than anyone.

36:02.833 --> 36:04.916
So, it wasn't you
that killed your brother.

36:04.916 --> 36:06.958
And it wasn't you at Nockmaar either.

36:06.958 --> 36:10.750
- Uh, well, yes, but neither time.
- So who are you?

36:13.375 --> 36:16.458
I guess I'm still trying to figure it out.

36:19.375 --> 36:23.125
Okay. Let me know when you do.

36:23.708 --> 36:27.416
And that's why I never leave home
without a good digestive tonic,

36:27.416 --> 36:29.416
and at least three pairs of clean socks.

36:31.333 --> 36:34.458
See, you guys are laughing,
and you probably don't even wear socks.

36:35.958 --> 36:38.166
Top me off there, will you, love?

36:38.166 --> 36:41.041
Graydon. Come over here. Sit down.

36:42.458 --> 36:45.958
Aren't these people lovely?
Not long ago, we were scared of them.

36:45.958 --> 36:48.375
- Especially this guy.
- What did I do?

36:48.375 --> 36:49.666
Here, come on, sit down.

36:50.333 --> 36:52.375
Have a drink.

37:07.458 --> 37:10.000
- I know we're not really friends...
- Hmm.

37:10.750 --> 37:12.000
Not even a little bit.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.333
But I'm pretty sure you're not evil.
You know, just sorta...

37:18.208 --> 37:19.208
mean.

37:19.208 --> 37:21.625
You're not as useless
as I thought you were.

37:22.208 --> 37:23.833
As I maybe said you were,

37:23.833 --> 37:26.916
although I don't feel like
I would've said that.

37:28.291 --> 37:29.833
No, you did.

37:30.541 --> 37:32.500
Well, I was wrong.

37:34.125 --> 37:35.208
Yet again.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.166
- I was cruel...
- I blew it with Jade.

37:50.458 --> 37:51.916
- Hmm?
- What?

37:52.958 --> 37:56.000
- Were you gonna ask for my advice?
- No. No.

37:56.625 --> 37:58.166
- Okay.
- Definitely not.

38:01.458 --> 38:03.375
Yes.

38:03.375 --> 38:04.458
What do I do?

38:06.666 --> 38:10.041
Talk to her. And apologize.

38:10.041 --> 38:12.208
- For what?
- It doesn't matter.

38:12.208 --> 38:14.875
Just say the words, "I'm sorry."

38:15.833 --> 38:18.416
Tell her that you understand.

38:18.416 --> 38:20.833
Tell her that you wanna get better.

38:22.708 --> 38:26.166
And that you'll be there, waiting for her

38:27.125 --> 38:28.666
when she's ready for you to...

38:29.208 --> 38:30.250
to prove it.

38:37.083 --> 38:38.875
Wait, could you say that all again?

38:40.125 --> 38:42.375
- I have to go and find Graydon.
- Wait, but I...

38:42.375 --> 38:44.000
I need more advice.

38:45.916 --> 38:47.583
You'll be fine.

38:48.166 --> 38:49.291
Just be honest.

38:51.208 --> 38:56.125
And with these damn truth plums,
it's impossible to be anything else.

39:04.375 --> 39:05.750
I need to talk to you.

39:06.916 --> 39:07.958
Um...

39:09.291 --> 39:12.666
I mean, I'd...
I'd really like to talk to you.

39:14.083 --> 39:16.208
You, look at me,

39:17.500 --> 39:18.958
are a good person.

39:20.291 --> 39:24.125
I don't know if I am.
I mean, I've done some bad things.

39:24.125 --> 39:28.250
Don't say that.
We all have doubts and insecurities.

39:28.250 --> 39:30.208
You've just gotta
fight through those

39:30.208 --> 39:32.125
and be bold.

39:32.125 --> 39:34.666
It's easy for you to say.
You're Willow Ufgood,

39:34.666 --> 39:38.208
the greatest sorcerer of the world.

39:38.750 --> 39:41.166
I'm not, actually. I never was.

39:41.166 --> 39:43.083
Mediocre at best.

39:43.666 --> 39:45.583
But you defeated Bavmorda.

39:47.333 --> 39:50.375
Psst, come here, come here.
Come on. Shh.

39:51.791 --> 39:53.375
It was dumb luck.

39:53.375 --> 39:56.375
I built my entire reputation
on that one success.

39:56.375 --> 39:58.875
But, no, uh, uh,
I used to stay up late at night

39:58.875 --> 40:01.291
and read all your adventures
and close calls.

40:01.291 --> 40:02.625
You were so wise.

40:02.625 --> 40:05.291
Behind all that, uh, "wisdom,"

40:06.083 --> 40:09.916
Willow Ufgood here is terrified
that one day he'll be discovered

40:09.916 --> 40:12.958
as the aging, talentless hack
that he really is.

40:13.333 --> 40:14.833
Whoa.

40:14.833 --> 40:16.000
Hey, Elora.

40:17.125 --> 40:18.125
Ooh.

40:18.708 --> 40:20.000
Oh.

40:20.375 --> 40:24.041
Truth plums, huh? Never again.

40:36.791 --> 40:39.125
You look like you belong here.

40:39.125 --> 40:40.208
I do.

40:40.208 --> 40:41.375
I know.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.666
But the thing is, I need you.

40:44.708 --> 40:46.041
Yeah. On the quest.

40:46.833 --> 40:48.166
I mean, all of it.

40:50.666 --> 40:52.166
I mean, life.

40:53.083 --> 40:55.666
And I know
my dad killed your dad.

40:57.750 --> 41:00.291
I can't even imagine
how you're feeling right now.

41:02.958 --> 41:03.958
I don't care.

41:04.708 --> 41:05.708
You don't?

41:08.791 --> 41:10.583
Not really.

41:12.875 --> 41:13.958
I'm not him.

41:15.416 --> 41:16.708
Jade...

41:18.833 --> 41:20.125
All I care about is you.

41:20.791 --> 41:23.750
And if you wanna come here,
after we find Airk, to live,

41:24.666 --> 41:27.166
I would tag along. If that's okay.

41:27.166 --> 41:31.541
'Cause I don't wanna have any adventures
unless they're with you.

41:32.583 --> 41:35.416
I should've
told you that sooner, you know?

41:35.416 --> 41:39.375
And for that, for everything,
I'm so sorry.

41:46.958 --> 41:49.750
All right, uh, what did you wanna say?

41:52.041 --> 41:53.208
Truth?

41:54.666 --> 41:55.750
Plum.

41:56.833 --> 42:01.250
I am,
and have been for some time,

42:02.708 --> 42:03.875
just...

42:05.291 --> 42:10.666
totally, ridiculously, desperately

42:11.250 --> 42:12.333
in love with you.

42:13.166 --> 42:15.791
And in about ten seconds,
I'm gonna kiss you.

42:15.791 --> 42:17.208
So, if you don't want that...

42:17.208 --> 42:18.708
Yes, I would...

42:19.500 --> 42:21.291
I mean, I would be very into that.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.125
Are you sure?

42:28.083 --> 42:29.625
Because if I do,

42:31.708 --> 42:32.958
if I kiss you,

42:35.250 --> 42:36.666
I may never stop.

42:37.541 --> 42:40.833
I suppose
there's only one way to find out.

42:48.291 --> 42:51.916
Kit! Kit! Kit! Kit!

43:09.791 --> 43:11.791
Willow! Willow!

43:11.791 --> 43:13.958
They got her!
They pulled her up into the trees!

43:13.958 --> 43:15.791
Run! Run!

43:15.791 --> 43:16.958
Willow!

43:24.375 --> 43:25.583
Trolls.
