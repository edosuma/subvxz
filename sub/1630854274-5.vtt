WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.541
Wouldn't you rather give it all at once
to something real?

00:06.291 --> 00:08.041
What would we be stealing?

00:08.125 --> 00:11.500
The quarterly payroll
for an entire Imperial sector.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.625
Blevin, this incident on Ferrix.

00:13.625 --> 00:16.333
Corporate Security, sir.
They're still in charge out there.

00:16.333 --> 00:19.500
A stolen Imperial Starpath unit
was recovered at the scene.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.583
<i>Five months in?</i>

00:20.583 --> 00:23.125
Just plug in some new person?
It'll tear the team apart.

00:23.125 --> 00:24.875
I'm buying you critical redundancy.

00:24.875 --> 00:26.916
- What do you mean "buying"?
- I'm paying him.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.083
We've been eating roots
and sleeping on rocks for this rebellion

00:30.083 --> 00:32.041
and now you've got a mercenary on board?

00:32.125 --> 00:34.250
<i>Take him or call it off.</i>

00:34.250 --> 00:37.291
- You're taking on an Imperial armory?
- Are you not joining us?

00:37.375 --> 00:39.333
<i>Us? How many of us are there?</i>

00:39.333 --> 00:40.458
<i>Now we are seven.</i>

00:40.458 --> 00:41.958
That's Skeen.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.333
Taramyn.

00:43.333 --> 00:44.416
Nemik.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.500
- Cinta. And Lieutenant Gorn.
- Who is he?

00:46.500 --> 00:48.500
He's Clem.
He's here. That's all that matters.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.541
We're wasting daylight.
Let's get on with it.

00:50.625 --> 00:56.541
As of this morning, the Morlana system
is under permanent Imperial authority.

00:56.625 --> 00:58.041
<i>Congratulations on that.</i>

00:58.625 --> 00:59.833
Mother.

01:00.708 --> 01:01.916
Senator.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.791
- If you can't deliver, I need to know.
- The money's there.

01:04.875 --> 01:07.083
It's just getting very dangerous
to move it around.

01:07.083 --> 01:09.000
You think I haven't thought this through?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.875
I'd be the first one to fall.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.083
That's a vault.

01:12.666 --> 01:14.916
We're taking crates of payroll
from that room,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.875
loading the freighter,
and escaping out of the runway tunnel.

01:17.875 --> 01:21.416
What we need to know is,
are you in all the way?

01:22.583 --> 01:23.958
Let's get to it.

02:49.375 --> 02:50.375
Syril.

02:51.333 --> 02:52.791
You're slouching.

02:59.750 --> 03:02.416
Is that how you've been
presenting yourself to the world?

03:03.583 --> 03:05.166
It would explain a great deal.

03:08.791 --> 03:13.541
Being a leader
isn't something one just turns on and off.

03:15.958 --> 03:19.416
By the time you've remembered
to sit up straight, it's too late.

03:21.083 --> 03:26.041
You might as well wear a sign that says,
"I promise to disappoint you."

03:27.875 --> 03:31.208
Shame we couldn't have seen more
of each other when you were flourishing.

03:31.208 --> 03:33.166
I'd have the memory to sustain me.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.416
Well, you could've come
any time you wanted.

03:36.500 --> 03:41.375
Any civilized being knows an open
invitation is no invitation at all.

03:41.375 --> 03:45.458
My assumption is,
you have no prospect for the future.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.625
I had a spare room.

03:48.250 --> 03:49.958
Could've visited any time you wanted.

03:49.958 --> 03:52.083
- You know that.
- I know what you tell me.

03:52.083 --> 03:53.375
I intuit the rest.

03:53.375 --> 03:57.208
I intuit you have no future prospects.

03:57.833 --> 04:00.250
I'd forgotten the precision
of your predictive powers.

04:01.208 --> 04:04.541
- Ah, you've remembered how to mock me.
- Forgotten how sensitive you can be.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.208
Perhaps you've forgotten my question.

04:06.208 --> 04:09.791
Do you have even
a single prospect before you?

04:11.541 --> 04:12.625
I'll find a way.

04:15.208 --> 04:16.541
I'm calling Uncle Harlo.

04:16.666 --> 04:18.875
I'm calling in the family favor.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.458
Haven't heard that in a while.

04:20.458 --> 04:21.791
These are desperate times.

04:21.875 --> 04:24.541
- You're assuming he'll remember you.
- That's amusing.

04:24.625 --> 04:26.250
And you think he'll talk to you?

04:26.250 --> 04:27.375
I know he will.

04:27.375 --> 04:29.125
And he'll know why I called.

04:29.125 --> 04:31.916
And he'll respect me
for having waited so long in asking

04:32.000 --> 04:34.291
and being so prudent about my request.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.958
What is it you'll be asking for?

04:37.958 --> 04:40.625
Someone who will take you on, Syril.

04:40.625 --> 04:42.375
Setting the bar high, are we?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.333
Uncle Harlo will know what's best.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.625
It's all there.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.250
Vel asked me to have a look.

05:36.583 --> 05:39.500
I think
she's having second thoughts.

05:41.625 --> 05:43.083
Go talk to her if you want.

05:43.083 --> 05:44.208
She'll be up soon.

05:47.833 --> 05:49.166
You didn't come with much.

05:50.458 --> 05:51.708
That plus the bad arm?

05:51.708 --> 05:54.250
It's pretty clear
you left wherever you were in a hurry.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.458
Corporate issue. Interesting.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.208
There's no sense bein' upset.

06:04.458 --> 06:06.208
You're lucky to be alive right now.

06:07.541 --> 06:10.291
We've been down here for months,
and the stakes are high.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.375
- How's your arm?
- I'll be fine.

06:13.375 --> 06:14.500
Uh-huh.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.708
And, uh, who... whose is this?

06:19.166 --> 06:20.208
Didn't get a name.

06:27.791 --> 06:28.791
Oh.

06:29.833 --> 06:31.666
You know what this means, don't you?

06:33.166 --> 06:35.083
Yeah, I saw your eyes go right to it.

06:36.083 --> 06:37.125
Krayt Head.

06:38.375 --> 06:39.708
See, they don't know.

06:41.416 --> 06:42.541
They got no idea.

06:44.750 --> 06:45.875
What about this?

06:47.500 --> 06:49.041
"By The Hand."

06:50.583 --> 06:51.666
So, where were you?

06:53.125 --> 06:54.375
Sipo.

06:54.375 --> 06:55.541
Youth center.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.833
Three years. I was 13 when I went in.

07:00.625 --> 07:01.750
I never heard of it.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.541
- Well, you didn't miss anything.
- Yeah.

07:06.625 --> 07:08.500
They've built a lot of cages, huh?

07:09.166 --> 07:11.416
"The axe forgets, but the tree remembers."

07:13.666 --> 07:15.500
Now it's our turn to do the chopping.

07:17.541 --> 07:18.625
So, that's it?

07:18.625 --> 07:20.041
That's why you're here?

07:20.125 --> 07:21.125
Revenge?

07:22.291 --> 07:23.833
Yeah, that's good enough for now.

07:25.416 --> 07:26.416
You?

07:29.666 --> 07:31.541
I was told I could help.

07:32.208 --> 07:34.083
Yeah, but you won't say by who.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.083
Working with other people is never easy.

07:37.916 --> 07:38.916
Yeah.

07:39.708 --> 07:41.958
I didn't mark you for a team player.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.500
It always breaks at the weakest point.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.083
Oh, you're worried about the kids.

07:48.666 --> 07:50.333
Nemik's a surprise.

07:50.333 --> 07:51.750
He's green, but he's all in.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.125
He's a true believer.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.583
Nothing but the cause for him.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.500
Then there's Cinta.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.000
Cinta Kaz.

07:59.708 --> 08:01.750
She's stone cold and fearless.

08:02.416 --> 08:04.083
Probably the toughest one here.

08:05.666 --> 08:08.875
She's already sharin' a blanket,
if that's what you're wonderin'.

08:11.125 --> 08:12.208
And the Lieutenant?

08:13.583 --> 08:15.166
Without him, there's no plan.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.583
He could be walking us right into a trap.

08:17.583 --> 08:19.750
They would've taken us down by now.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.500
Or maybe that's what you're here for.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.416
I'm here to win and walk away.

08:31.333 --> 08:32.666
Wouldn't that be lovely?

08:46.250 --> 08:47.500
The driver's here.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.500
Kloris.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.583
Yes.

08:52.458 --> 08:53.625
You know his name.

08:54.625 --> 08:55.625
Is Leida ready?

08:57.166 --> 08:58.166
I'm not sure.

08:58.791 --> 09:00.708
Where is she? Leida?

09:04.708 --> 09:06.333
Hmm. Did you eat?

09:06.333 --> 09:07.750
When would that have happened?

09:07.750 --> 09:08.875
I just came down.

09:08.875 --> 09:10.250
Take something for the ride.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.958
- What?
- We need to be going.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.916
Oh. Change in plan.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Dad's taking me.

09:15.458 --> 09:16.750
You're taking me, right?

09:17.500 --> 09:19.083
Got to clear it with her.

09:21.416 --> 09:23.083
I don't have early class today.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.125
- We planned this.
- You did.

09:26.833 --> 09:29.000
Get your coat. It's not up for discussion.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.583
Are you serious?

09:30.583 --> 09:32.083
Am I serious?

09:32.083 --> 09:34.333
Just go. You're off the hook.

09:35.625 --> 09:36.958
Enjoying this?

09:38.083 --> 09:39.208
Get your coat.

09:39.791 --> 09:42.000
It's out of your way anyway,
so what's the point?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.500
The point is, we have a schedule,
the driver's waiting,

09:44.500 --> 09:48.000
- I've planned on this, and we're going.
- You're only doing it to show off.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.500
- What?
- Just go.

09:50.625 --> 09:52.250
What would I be showing off?

09:52.250 --> 09:54.166
That you're involved somehow.

09:56.458 --> 09:57.916
What? That's just...

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Nobody cares. You can relax.

10:01.458 --> 10:03.541
That's just so hurtful.

10:04.375 --> 10:06.541
- See? There you go.
- Go where?

10:06.625 --> 10:07.791
That's my point.

10:08.666 --> 10:10.291
It's all about you, isn't it?

10:10.375 --> 10:11.458
It's always all about you.

10:11.458 --> 10:13.500
Is this really
how you'd like to start the day?

10:13.500 --> 10:15.125
I didn't choose this conversation.

10:21.958 --> 10:23.625
I so appreciate the support.

10:44.708 --> 10:45.708
Dray milk.

10:48.541 --> 10:49.708
You can live on it.

10:49.708 --> 10:52.708
You may question your existence
after a few days, but...

10:55.958 --> 10:57.375
Memorable, isn't it?

11:04.125 --> 11:05.416
That's an old one.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.958
Old and true.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.041
And sturdy.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.458
One of the best
navigational tools ever built.

11:10.958 --> 11:12.333
Can't be jammed or intercepted.

11:12.333 --> 11:14.500
Something breaks, you can fix it yourself.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.666
Hard to learn.

11:16.750 --> 11:20.125
Yes, but once you've mastered it,
you're free.

11:20.833 --> 11:24.000
We've grown reliant on Imperial tech,
and we've made ourselves vulnerable.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.166
There's a growing list
of things we've known and forgotten,

11:26.250 --> 11:27.583
things they've pushed us to forget.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.375
Things like freedom.

11:30.541 --> 11:32.333
Nemik sees oppression everywhere.

11:32.958 --> 11:36.250
Skeen pretends not to listen,
but I know the message is sinking in.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.458
He's writin' a manifesto.

11:39.458 --> 11:40.541
Did he tell you?

11:41.166 --> 11:44.375
Apparently, the only thing keepin' us
from liberty is a few more ideas.

11:44.375 --> 11:45.541
Few more ideas.

11:45.625 --> 11:46.958
It's so confusing, isn't it?

11:46.958 --> 11:50.375
So much going wrong, so much to say,
and all of it happening so quickly.

11:50.375 --> 11:53.208
The pace of repression
outstrips our ability to understand it.

11:53.208 --> 11:55.458
And that is the real trick
of the Imperial thought machine.

11:55.458 --> 11:58.916
It's easier to hide behind
40 atrocities than a single incident.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.125
But they have a fight on their hands,
don't they?

12:01.125 --> 12:03.791
Our elemental rights
are such a simple thing to hold,

12:03.875 --> 12:06.458
they will have to shake the galaxy hard
to loosen our grip.

12:06.458 --> 12:08.208
I'd like to hear what Clem believes.

12:11.291 --> 12:12.666
I know what I'm against.

12:13.791 --> 12:15.458
Everything else will have to wait.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.375
You're my ideal reader.

12:17.375 --> 12:20.375
- Now you've done it.
- Haven't titled it yet. I've been waiting.

12:20.375 --> 12:23.375
It's a work in progress, and I know
that there's a great deal left to say.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.750
I mean, look.

12:24.750 --> 12:25.833
Right here.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.375
Fresh inspiration.

12:27.375 --> 12:30.041
Two seemingly random objects,
and yet this charts an astral path,

12:30.125 --> 12:32.250
this maps the trail
of political consciousness.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.375
Both systems based on truth,

12:33.375 --> 12:35.583
both navigating toward clear
and achievable outcomes.

12:35.583 --> 12:37.166
- Basic facts expanded to...
- Clem.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.500
To be continued.

12:42.708 --> 12:44.625
Busy day, Clem. Finish your milk.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.125
You don't trust him?

13:00.416 --> 13:01.583
- I barely trust you.
- Hmm.

13:02.166 --> 13:04.291
Obviously, it's a track launch,

13:04.375 --> 13:07.208
so there's an adjusted thrust ratio
to make it up the ramp.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.250
- Okay.
- It's on an overhead rail.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.166
- Has to be, yeah.
- So calibrating the weight...

13:15.625 --> 13:17.583
- What about it?
- How would you do it?

13:17.583 --> 13:19.291
How would I know the weight?

13:20.583 --> 13:21.833
Is this a test?

13:22.708 --> 13:23.791
It's a simple question.

13:26.208 --> 13:28.583
You don't know
how to get it off the runway, do you?

13:28.583 --> 13:29.875
We know how to fly it.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.916
Yeah, but you've
got to get it up there first.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.458
Answer the question.

13:33.875 --> 13:35.333
You really don't.

13:36.291 --> 13:37.333
Do you?

13:37.750 --> 13:39.500
You don't know how to get it out of there.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.458
How do you input the weight?

13:42.708 --> 13:44.916
- You sure it's on the rail?
- Yes.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.625
It's mounted?

13:46.625 --> 13:47.958
It's ready to go?

13:47.958 --> 13:49.708
That's how they keep it,
you're sure of that?

13:49.708 --> 13:51.000
Yes, we're sure.

13:51.583 --> 13:54.666
Lieutenant Gorn is in there every day.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.333
Okay.

13:56.333 --> 13:57.958
There's a load clutch.

13:57.958 --> 14:01.916
It... It's a big ugly handle
just right next to the booster throttle.

14:02.625 --> 14:06.875
There's a gauge just below
to read out the weight.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.625
Why isn't this in the manual?

14:08.625 --> 14:10.791
Because it's a custom job.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.458
It's an add-on.

14:12.583 --> 14:15.458
What were you gonna do
if I wasn't here?

14:15.583 --> 14:18.333
Might have been ugly
but we'd have figured it out.

14:18.333 --> 14:20.083
We wanted to be sure.

14:20.250 --> 14:23.583
- Oh. Okay. I'll pilot.
- No, you'll do as you're told.

14:23.583 --> 14:24.750
Ah, I'm flying it.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.583
We can say it's your idea. I don't care.

14:26.583 --> 14:30.125
But if it's my ass on the line,
I'm pulling this thing out of there.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.750
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:52.833 --> 14:54.041
Clem.

14:59.250 --> 15:00.250
The tower yard.

15:01.416 --> 15:02.416
The dam.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.958
The garrison HQ
and the barracks up top by the east end.

15:07.041 --> 15:08.125
The Rono tunnel.

15:09.250 --> 15:10.708
The flight control tower.

15:11.458 --> 15:15.208
And objective number one,
the door at the base of the tower.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.125
The Temple Path.

15:20.166 --> 15:24.333
Now, the real thing has a downhill pitch,
but the distance is right.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.000
And down there,
where we'll be coming from,

15:29.041 --> 15:30.041
The Old Temple.

15:33.208 --> 15:34.208
Got it.

15:41.458 --> 15:42.541
What's this?

15:46.333 --> 15:47.333
Target practice?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.333
Where are they?

15:54.375 --> 15:55.916
This was to be cleaned up yesterday.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.041
- Where are they?
- They should be back soon, sir.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.416
Back from where?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.333
I believe they're in the tower, sir.

16:01.333 --> 16:04.416
The Commandant's wife needed help
moving furniture for the dinner.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.541
I'll be back in an hour.

16:09.625 --> 16:12.916
This had better be well on its way,
or I promise you,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.875
I'll be revisiting
the schedule for winter furloughs.

16:22.958 --> 16:25.458
You are Imperial Private Clem.

16:26.041 --> 16:30.541
You're a sentry from the Alkenzi Airbase
transferred for special duty.

16:31.833 --> 16:32.833
Shoulders back.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.750
- More.
- Don't touch me.

16:38.833 --> 16:40.500
You want something, you tell me.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.833
Can you walk like a soldier?

16:46.750 --> 16:48.000
I've seen it done.

16:49.250 --> 16:51.208
Let's find out
if you've been payin' attention.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.291
Form up.

17:07.708 --> 17:10.125
I don't care where it goes.
Just get it out of here.

17:10.125 --> 17:11.625
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

17:12.375 --> 17:13.666
Captain Tigo!

17:16.708 --> 17:17.916
There you are.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.666
They're still clearing out some guests.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.708
What do you think?

17:23.708 --> 17:24.791
As a hotel?

17:26.250 --> 17:27.708
Do you want it or not?

17:28.250 --> 17:29.583
The assignment?

17:29.583 --> 17:31.458
No, you're taking the assignment.

17:31.458 --> 17:33.875
I was asking if this would do
as your headquarters.

17:35.791 --> 17:37.125
Could I be made Prefect?

17:37.958 --> 17:40.416
The title.
I know it doesn't come with extra pay.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.000
You can wear a ball gown if you'd like.

17:43.708 --> 17:46.500
Just get this up and running
before my next staff meeting.

17:54.625 --> 17:56.166
It's about confidence.

17:56.250 --> 17:57.708
We belong here.

17:57.708 --> 17:59.000
We're followin' orders.

17:59.958 --> 18:01.875
The door's bein' opened as we approach.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.750
Lieutenant Gorn will be out front.
He's the leader.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.041
He's the gatekeeper.

18:06.125 --> 18:08.541
So eyes on him at all times.

18:08.625 --> 18:10.541
We're locked in. We're listenin'.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.125
We're ready to adapt.

18:12.125 --> 18:15.375
And last man in bolts the door behind him.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.250
Squad, halt.

18:21.583 --> 18:22.583
Questions?

18:23.291 --> 18:24.666
What are they doing?

18:25.750 --> 18:26.875
Never mind about them.

18:26.875 --> 18:29.041
You got enough to worry about.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.083
Let's walk it again at speed.

18:32.208 --> 18:33.375
You should switch.

18:34.541 --> 18:35.541
What?

18:36.333 --> 18:37.625
He's left-handed.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.583
Should swap sides.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.333
Why don't you get a handle
on what we're doing here

18:43.333 --> 18:45.291
before you start making suggestions.

18:46.916 --> 18:48.208
Why?

18:49.541 --> 18:50.583
Why switch sides?

18:52.125 --> 18:53.375
Skeen is left-handed.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.166
You want your weapon on the outside.

18:59.125 --> 19:01.083
- What am I?
- Right-handed.

19:01.750 --> 19:02.750
Taramyn?

19:03.333 --> 19:04.708
- Right.
- Cinta?

19:04.708 --> 19:05.791
Right.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.041
Nemik?

19:07.125 --> 19:09.833
Favors right, but shoots left.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.500
Fine.

19:15.791 --> 19:16.791
Let's switch.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.291
Any other suggestions?

19:23.250 --> 19:24.333
Wait!

19:28.666 --> 19:29.750
Cover the guns.

19:31.083 --> 19:32.333
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

19:39.916 --> 19:42.083
- He's gone.
- I don't think so.

20:07.875 --> 20:08.875
They'll soon see.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.500
Surprise from above
is never as shocking as one from below.

20:26.458 --> 20:27.791
Corporal Kimzi.

20:27.875 --> 20:28.875
Sir.

20:29.583 --> 20:30.583
Enjoying the view?

20:30.583 --> 20:31.666
Yes, sir.

20:32.708 --> 20:34.750
Gets a bit stale in there sometimes.

20:38.041 --> 20:40.166
It's always inspiring, isn't it?

20:41.666 --> 20:42.750
I suppose.

20:45.125 --> 20:47.541
Is it true they're tearing this all down?

20:48.125 --> 20:49.208
It's been discussed.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.208
Move the airbase here?

20:52.625 --> 20:53.666
That makes sense.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.208
It's a big project.

20:55.208 --> 20:57.958
Not too many Dhanis
to worry about anymore though, eh?

20:59.041 --> 21:00.875
How many do you think we'll have tomorrow?

21:01.750 --> 21:02.750
I don't know.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.583
It was less than a hundred last time.

21:06.416 --> 21:08.250
Still enough to smell 'em, right?

21:10.333 --> 21:13.083
Can you imagine this place
with a couple of thousand of them?

21:15.791 --> 21:16.833
Yes.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.541
I can.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.541
Get about your business, Corporal.

21:21.625 --> 21:24.333
I'll be making rounds tomorrow night,
and I expect you at your station.

21:24.333 --> 21:25.500
Sir. Yes, sir.

21:46.833 --> 21:48.833
- "Hello."
- <i>Nahrvai.</i>

21:48.833 --> 21:49.958
Again.

21:49.958 --> 21:51.083
<i>Nahrvai.</i>

21:52.708 --> 21:53.750
"Stop."

21:53.750 --> 21:54.875
<i>Naishe.</i>

21:55.750 --> 21:56.791
<i>Naych.</i>

21:56.875 --> 21:57.875
It's hard.

21:58.333 --> 21:59.583
<i>Naych.</i>

21:59.708 --> 22:00.708
How's your arm?

22:00.708 --> 22:02.625
It's good. You're a healer.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.375
Hey! What are you doing?

22:05.375 --> 22:07.166
I'm just moving your stuff.

22:07.250 --> 22:09.083
- Don't.
- It was in the way.

22:09.083 --> 22:10.166
Don't ever.

22:10.250 --> 22:11.833
I thought you were checking the comms.

22:18.958 --> 22:20.375
Hey.

22:20.375 --> 22:21.833
And you can dress yourself.

22:22.458 --> 22:23.708
Who packed these charges?

22:23.708 --> 22:24.875
That would be me.

22:35.625 --> 22:36.875
I can fit three more in here.

22:44.166 --> 22:45.500
Let's have a look at you.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.833
Make a soldier of you yet.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.458
So, I'll want weekly reports from Ferrix.

22:58.458 --> 23:01.083
And I want to keep
a tight hand on the budget.

23:01.083 --> 23:03.500
Now, what did I miss while I was gone?

23:03.500 --> 23:04.833
The Finkly Conference.

23:04.833 --> 23:07.083
They have agreed to move up your speech...

23:11.083 --> 23:12.208
<i>Hosnian Prime?</i>

23:12.208 --> 23:13.333
<i>It's useless.</i>

23:13.333 --> 23:15.458
They haven't broken,
misplaced, or mislabeled

23:15.458 --> 23:17.833
a single military component
in the past 12 quarters.

23:17.833 --> 23:20.958
Well, maybe there's, uh,
an unofficial ledger.

23:20.958 --> 23:23.458
I... I wouldn't trust
anything coming out of there.

23:23.458 --> 23:26.041
Imperial Navy is the only account
they have left at this point,

23:26.125 --> 23:27.958
and they'd never admit anything's wrong.

23:27.958 --> 23:29.083
You should go.

23:29.083 --> 23:30.666
I didn't realize how late it was.

23:31.916 --> 23:33.333
I'm staying if you are.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.750
I don't know what I'm doing.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.750
About any of it.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.125
Yes, you do.

23:39.125 --> 23:40.541
You're onto something.

23:41.416 --> 23:44.958
Kessel, Fondor,
targeting consoles from Jakku,

23:44.958 --> 23:48.333
proton warheads from Base Cay,
the Steergard Starpath.

23:48.333 --> 23:49.625
He's right though.

23:50.666 --> 23:52.375
It's too spread out to be organized.

23:52.375 --> 23:53.791
But you don't believe that.

23:56.541 --> 23:58.125
I know this.

23:58.125 --> 24:01.625
If I was them, this is how I'd do it.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.750
I'd spread it out.

24:04.875 --> 24:07.166
Never climb the same fence twice.

24:07.833 --> 24:10.416
It's too random to be random.

24:14.250 --> 24:15.333
Two more files each?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.083
Stay focused, Clem.

25:15.500 --> 25:16.500
To the Rebellion.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.958
To the Rebellion.

25:51.125 --> 25:55.041
I needn't tell you how wrong
you were about Uncle Harlo.

25:55.125 --> 25:56.291
But you will.

25:56.375 --> 26:01.291
He said he never felt police work
was your chosen path.

26:01.375 --> 26:02.708
'Cause he knows me so well.

26:02.708 --> 26:04.166
And whose fault is that?

26:04.250 --> 26:05.333
Can I guess?

26:06.958 --> 26:10.500
Perhaps you'll study Uncle Harlo
with more energy in the future.

26:13.291 --> 26:15.416
What field is it
he thinks I should be pursuing?

26:15.500 --> 26:18.125
He said he wanted to think about it.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.291
I struggled with how best to describe
to him the events that have led us here.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.875
I told him how sorry you were
about what happened.

26:27.458 --> 26:32.458
I stressed that it was a large enough
mistake to be deeply educational.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.875
Yes, I heard some of that.

26:33.875 --> 26:35.125
Our conversation?

26:35.125 --> 26:36.333
Your side of it.

26:36.333 --> 26:37.416
Hard to miss.

26:38.791 --> 26:41.583
Sadly, I wasn't able
to study Uncle Harlo's response.

26:42.208 --> 26:44.250
He knows how much we're counting on him.

26:50.666 --> 26:52.583
Stairs to the hangar?

26:52.583 --> 26:54.541
Four flights, four landings.

26:54.625 --> 26:56.125
Vault cage weak point?

26:56.958 --> 26:58.500
Top corners.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.041
Distance to load ramp?

27:00.125 --> 27:01.541
Twenty-eight meters.

27:01.625 --> 27:03.041
Emergency comm signal?

27:03.666 --> 27:05.041
Red-Red.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.125
Clear signal?

27:06.125 --> 27:07.458
My turn.

27:07.458 --> 27:08.666
Lieutenant Gorn.

27:09.750 --> 27:12.875
What's an Imperial lieutenant doing
getting involved with this?

27:14.250 --> 27:15.708
What difference does it make?

27:16.458 --> 27:18.125
Everyone else seems to know.

27:21.916 --> 27:24.666
He fell in love with a local woman
and lost a promotion.

27:25.958 --> 27:27.125
Then he lost the woman.

27:28.083 --> 27:29.916
Then he lost his taste for the Empire.

27:31.833 --> 27:33.625
Everyone has their own rebellion.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.958
Is the shipment secure, sir?

27:47.958 --> 27:49.166
Attention!

27:53.500 --> 27:54.750
Sir.

27:54.750 --> 27:55.958
As you were.

27:57.166 --> 27:59.875
I prepared
a reduced schedule for tomorrow.

27:59.875 --> 28:03.250
- I know you were eager for that.
- It'll mean a great deal to the men.

28:03.250 --> 28:06.500
And now,
I see the gantry's still unpainted.

28:07.125 --> 28:08.500
I've spoken to them about it, sir.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.250
And yet it remains undone

28:10.250 --> 28:13.916
with an engineering officer from Coruscant
arriving today and in our business.

28:14.416 --> 28:17.708
Let's see if painting it tomorrow night
will make the point more clearly.

28:18.625 --> 28:19.625
Sir.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.625
May I speak plainly, sir?

28:21.625 --> 28:23.083
Plainly and quickly.

28:23.083 --> 28:24.166
Aldhani, sir.

28:24.958 --> 28:27.208
It's not many people's
first-choice assignment.

28:27.208 --> 28:29.250
The thing you hear when posted to Aldhani

28:29.250 --> 28:32.125
is that perhaps you'll be lucky enough
to be there for the Eye.

28:32.125 --> 28:34.166
The idea of being this close
and not seeing it,

28:34.250 --> 28:35.958
and I know we can't all be up there,

28:35.958 --> 28:38.291
but I fear morale might be crushed
by having anything more

28:38.375 --> 28:40.500
than an essential roster
down here tomorrow night.

28:43.875 --> 28:45.666
I want it painted the day after tomorrow.

28:45.750 --> 28:48.208
I'll be here midday,
and I expect to see it shine.

28:48.208 --> 28:49.708
- Absolutely, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

28:49.708 --> 28:51.791
Make sure the men know
how close they've come.

29:25.750 --> 29:27.166
Don't move.

29:28.083 --> 29:30.625
-'Cause you know what'll happen.
- Hey, what are you doing?

29:33.333 --> 29:34.416
There we go.

29:35.958 --> 29:37.000
I knew it.

29:37.458 --> 29:39.708
I knew you were lying. I knew it.

29:40.375 --> 29:41.583
- Look.
- What is it?

29:42.333 --> 29:43.500
Kyber.

29:43.500 --> 29:44.833
Sky kyber.

29:45.625 --> 29:46.666
He's been hiding it.

29:46.750 --> 29:47.750
Skeen?

29:47.750 --> 29:49.916
- Sky kyber. Look at it glow.
- What's going on?

29:50.000 --> 29:51.125
I warned you.

29:51.125 --> 29:53.875
He comes here with nothin'
but the clothes on his back

29:53.875 --> 29:56.083
and a stone worth 30,000 credits?

29:56.083 --> 29:58.541
- You have a problem, you come to me.
- Here I am.

29:58.625 --> 30:01.583
I've topped out on questions, Vel.
I have reached my limit.

30:01.583 --> 30:03.208
He won't say why he's here,

30:03.208 --> 30:04.291
where he's from.

30:04.375 --> 30:07.291
He doesn't say what he believes in.
And now this?

30:07.375 --> 30:09.583
Who brings a treasure to a robbery?

30:09.583 --> 30:11.416
We don't have time for this.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.708
I need to know who I'm riding with.

30:13.708 --> 30:15.458
You know exactly who I am.

30:16.041 --> 30:18.208
- And you know I'll kill you for it.
- Okay.

30:18.208 --> 30:20.583
Okay, so, I guess we know
it's not a fake, huh?

30:20.583 --> 30:23.708
- It's your call.
- Let's not go too far, Clem.

30:23.708 --> 30:26.166
- I just want what's mine.
- Yeah, don't put me on the spot.

30:26.250 --> 30:27.416
Enough!

30:27.500 --> 30:28.833
Everyone stands down.

30:29.666 --> 30:30.666
Everyone!

30:30.750 --> 30:33.541
There's something coming!
There's a... There's a ship in the valley!

30:33.625 --> 30:34.666
Get your packs up.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.041
Move!

30:36.125 --> 30:37.291
Put the weapon away.

30:37.375 --> 30:39.666
Give him the stone.
You can kill each other later.

30:41.875 --> 30:43.541
You'd be right where I am.

30:45.250 --> 30:46.791
Tell yourself whatever you want.

30:46.875 --> 30:48.333
I think we're okay!

30:48.333 --> 30:50.333
It's heading towards the garrison!

30:51.333 --> 30:52.916
Get your stuff! Move!

30:55.208 --> 30:56.958
We'll talk when we're safe.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.750
I'm being paid.

31:08.666 --> 31:09.708
Paid to be here.

31:11.333 --> 31:12.500
You need to know?

31:12.500 --> 31:13.666
That's it.

31:16.458 --> 31:19.166
- What?
- Yeah, I'm here for the money.

31:20.125 --> 31:21.541
You can't live with that?

31:21.625 --> 31:22.875
I'm not worth it?

31:22.875 --> 31:24.625
I'll walk away and wish you luck.

31:25.416 --> 31:26.875
But that's what it is.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.291
I don't want to walk in
looking over my shoulder.

31:32.500 --> 31:33.541
You knew this?

31:34.750 --> 31:37.250
The choice was take him or call it off.

31:37.250 --> 31:39.500
- Call it off?
- You should've told us days ago.

31:40.166 --> 31:41.166
Maybe so.

31:41.250 --> 31:42.916
It just would've been something else.

31:44.541 --> 31:45.625
What's that mean?

31:45.625 --> 31:47.625
The day before is always hard.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.166
Too much time to worry.

31:50.250 --> 31:51.458
You think we're scared?

31:51.458 --> 31:52.875
I know you are.

31:52.875 --> 31:54.291
It's really only the money?

31:54.875 --> 31:56.333
To take a risk like this?

31:56.333 --> 31:57.458
Come on.

31:57.458 --> 31:59.333
Maybe you're the one that's afraid.

31:59.333 --> 32:00.708
Of course I'm afraid.

32:01.291 --> 32:04.208
But there's a difference
between fear and losing your nerve.

32:04.208 --> 32:05.583
You want out of this?

32:06.166 --> 32:07.166
Make a choice.

32:07.250 --> 32:09.166
Don't use me as an excuse.

32:12.916 --> 32:14.125
Cinta?

32:14.791 --> 32:15.791
No.

32:16.750 --> 32:17.791
She didn't tell me.

32:22.458 --> 32:24.666
Let's get to the camp in one piece.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.083
You can all chew on it there.

32:27.916 --> 32:28.916
All of you.

32:30.625 --> 32:31.625
Move.

32:49.375 --> 32:51.083
You saw me talking to Gar Tafeed.

32:51.083 --> 32:52.916
Mmm. You were busy tonight.

32:53.791 --> 32:55.958
He knows more about
what you're up to than I do.

32:56.833 --> 32:58.500
Must be embarrassing.

32:59.458 --> 33:02.416
When were you planning to tell me
about this new foundation?

33:03.750 --> 33:06.666
Well, I didn't think you'd be interested.

33:08.166 --> 33:09.208
Why is that?

33:10.708 --> 33:11.791
It's charitable.

33:15.083 --> 33:16.083
Hmm.

33:19.500 --> 33:20.500
What's his name?

33:21.750 --> 33:22.791
Kloris.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.541
- Kloris?
- Sir?

33:27.291 --> 33:29.291
<i>Would you mind taking the Expressway?</i>

33:29.375 --> 33:30.416
Yes, sir.

33:59.166 --> 34:01.000
Looks just like your model.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.291
Should do.

34:02.375 --> 34:04.208
I've had plenty of time to study,

34:04.208 --> 34:06.458
and we've been
sneaking up here for months.

34:08.708 --> 34:10.125
We need to signal soon.

34:10.125 --> 34:11.833
Let's get a fire up. Let's go.

34:56.583 --> 34:58.458
Okay, that should do it.

35:06.458 --> 35:07.666
Skeen.

35:24.875 --> 35:27.041
She wants me to tell you about my brother.

35:29.166 --> 35:32.791
There's a long version,
but what matters is they killed him.

35:33.666 --> 35:34.750
He was a farmer.

35:35.791 --> 35:38.500
Imperial Prefect came in,
took his land, flooded it.

35:40.458 --> 35:41.625
He couldn't fight him.

35:42.958 --> 35:47.791
He couldn't bear it, so he went a boat
and filled his pockets with stones.

35:50.041 --> 35:52.416
I always hated the Empire.

35:54.458 --> 35:56.833
I don't really know
what to call how I feel now.

36:01.583 --> 36:02.750
What kind of farm?

36:04.541 --> 36:05.916
Trees.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.208
Pepper trees.

36:08.666 --> 36:09.916
Centuries of 'em.

36:14.791 --> 36:17.250
That's as close to an apology
as you're gonna get.

36:21.625 --> 36:22.875
It's close enough.

36:32.166 --> 36:33.583
Taramyn's in charge now.

36:34.541 --> 36:35.666
Completely in charge.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.958
I need to know you understand that.

36:38.541 --> 36:39.875
Where will you be?

36:39.875 --> 36:42.458
If all goes well,
we'll see you tomorrow night.

36:44.583 --> 36:47.208
I need to hear you tell me
you can follow the plan.

36:48.166 --> 36:49.916
You won't have a problem with me.

36:53.500 --> 36:54.666
Good luck to you.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.333
No farewells tonight.

36:58.083 --> 36:59.916
Plenty of work to do together tomorrow.

37:46.166 --> 37:47.750
I thought you were turning it off.

37:48.625 --> 37:49.791
I was just going to.

37:50.625 --> 37:52.333
You said that an hour ago.

37:52.333 --> 37:53.458
Am I keeping you up?

37:55.208 --> 37:57.000
There's nothing coming through tonight.

37:57.541 --> 37:59.875
You want to be useful,
go clean some coins.

38:06.791 --> 38:07.791
Happy?

38:13.166 --> 38:15.083
Have you checked your walk-away pack?

38:15.083 --> 38:17.083
- Yes.
- And the one on the Fondor?

38:17.083 --> 38:18.875
I don't like seeing you nervous.

38:22.041 --> 38:23.875
There's nothing else you can do, Luthen.

38:23.875 --> 38:26.375
They're either gonna be okay out there
or they're not.

38:26.375 --> 38:29.000
Well, that's a daring prediction.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.916
- Vel's the only one who traces back.
- No.

38:32.500 --> 38:34.083
The thief. Andor.

38:34.083 --> 38:35.416
I wasn't careful.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.291
You wanted this to happen.

38:38.041 --> 38:39.208
This is what it took.

38:39.916 --> 38:41.416
It's never gonna be perfect.

38:42.541 --> 38:43.875
I wanted it too much.

38:46.208 --> 38:47.791
We have clients in the morning.

38:48.875 --> 38:50.208
Yeah, I'll be ready.

38:52.666 --> 38:54.583
It'll all be over this time tomorrow.

38:57.333 --> 38:58.916
Or it'll just be starting.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Or that.
