the reason?

06:43.458 --> 06:45.166
- Maybe we can test her

06:43.458 --> 06:45.166
and find out.

06:45.208 --> 06:46.959
- So, do you have any

06:45.208 --> 06:46.959
recollection of where

06:47.000 --> 06:48.959
this yodeling came from?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.458
- No.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.458
- Hmm.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.875
Or who it may have come from?

06:52.917 --> 06:54.500
- None whatsoever.

06:54.542 --> 06:56.208
- So you don't remember

06:54.542 --> 06:56.208
the three of us

06:56.250 --> 06:57.750
practicing our yodeling right

06:56.250 --> 06:57.750

07:05.834 --> 07:07.417

07:05.834 --> 07:07.417

07:14.875 --> 07:16.125
[together] We're so sorry, Dawn!

07:17.542 --> 07:19.625
- When we were seven, Mom took

07:17.542 --> 07:19.625
you to soccer,

07:19.667 --> 07:21.542
but Dad took us to yodeling.

07:21.583 --> 07:23.000
He wanted us to compete!

07:23.041 --> 07:24.750
- It was our secret shame!

07:24.792 --> 07:27.834
So we practiced at night when

07:24.792 --> 07:27.834
no one could hear us.

07:27.875 --> 07:29.792
- It must have gotten into your

07:27.875 --> 07:29.792
head while you were sleeping

07:29.834 --> 07:31.917
and that's why you yodeled.

07:31.959 --> 07:34.083
- Can I just have a taco now?

07:35.792 --> 07:37.583
- [scoffs] Seriously?

You're just making that up to

07:40.250 --> 07:43.250

07:43.291 --> 07:45.208

You and your late night yodeling

08:23.500 --> 08:24.667
You're right.

08:24.709 --> 08:26.000
I mean, it wasn't my fault.

It was your fault.
