eat at Ampersand?

a better experience than

No, he pretended like something
was really wrong with me,

02:21.720 --> 02:25.406

like I was having a hot flash.

02:25.480 --> 02:28.768

I'm so excited!

13:33.280 --> 13:36.682
And if you need us to do
anything, you just let us know.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.969
BART: Congratulations, son. I'm
sure she's a very nice lady.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.041
How old is she?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.724
Wow. Okay,
I got to go, Dad.

13:42.840 --> 13:43.841
Love you.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.443
Oh, thank God that's over.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.891
RENARD: Oregon highway State
Patrol Officer Aguilar

13:53.960 --> 13:55.405
was in high-speed pursuit
on the highway

13:55.520 --> 13:58.205
before the suspect turned
off on a frontage road.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.487
Officer Aguilar then caught
up to the suspect's vehicle

14:00.560 --> 14:02.927
approximately two minutes later.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.120
(PUNCHES THUDDING)
(GRUNTING)

14:28.440 --> 14:29.441
(SCREAMING)

14:29.520 --> 14:30.646
(VIDEO PAUSES)

14:32.440 --> 14:35.330
We received an update about 20
minutes ago from the State Police.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.767
They've linked this attack
to two other scalpings,

14:37.840 --> 14:41.287
one in San Diego of
a border patrol officer,

14:41.400 --> 14:43.767
the other attack in San
Rafael on a naval captain.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.888
We believe the suspect
entered illegally from Mexico

14:45.960 --> 14:47.928
and is now headed our way.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.810
So it seems that
we have a serial killer

14:49.880 --> 14:51.484
who's targeting men in uniform.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.120
No motive for the scalpings yet,

14:53.160 --> 14:55.242
other than he's
taking souvenirs.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.890
Now based on the pursuit video,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.571
we know the car to be
a 2011 Dodge Challenger.

14:59.640 --> 15:02.723
No plates, no registration,
but it does stand out.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.928
So look for it
but do not, I repeat,

15:05.000 --> 15:08.561
do not engage the suspect
without proper support.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.244
You got that?

15:10.320 --> 15:11.481
All right.
Let's be careful.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.081
Adalind.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.527
Sebastien?

15:30.840 --> 15:31.921
It's good you're early.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.047
Why?

15:33.760 --> 15:34.921
He's with Danilov.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.849
Am I supposed to
know who that is?

15:38.200 --> 15:39.645
You should.

15:39.720 --> 15:40.846
He's head of the Verrat.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.250
Be careful what you say.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.525
Why are you telling me this?

15:52.400 --> 15:54.050
We all need to be prudent now.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.605
Based on what I'm seeing,

15:58.680 --> 16:01.889
I doubt your man Breslau held
very much back. (EXHALES)

16:02.520 --> 16:03.806
Neither did they.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.769
Do we know who did this to him?

16:06.280 --> 16:08.567
We know these three men
were involved.

16:09.920 --> 16:14.209
Meisner, Frenay, and Tavitian.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.203
They met somewhere
outside Bratislava,

16:16.280 --> 16:18.203
which is where we believe
they killed Breslau.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.764
The Resistance is solidifying.

16:20.840 --> 16:23.241
That's distressing.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.651
And probably the reason
Sean Renard was here.

16:27.920 --> 16:31.129
Awfully annoying you didn't kill
him when you had the chance.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.489
Sir, I take full responsibility
for that failure.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.483
No need to take
responsibility, Gregor.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.289
I have bestowed it upon you.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.407
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

16:39.480 --> 16:40.811
Enter!

16:42.360 --> 16:44.442
Adalind Schade has arrived, sir.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.965
Show her in.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.321
Do you need me to
clear anything away?

16:52.400 --> 16:53.686
Not just now.

16:55.920 --> 16:59.003
Gregor Danilov, may I
present Fraulein Schade.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.201
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

17:00.280 --> 17:02.169
My pleasure.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.804
The pleasure is all mine.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.406
Don't you look lovely.
Thank you.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.608
We'd like you to take a
look at some photographs,

17:09.680 --> 17:11.329
and see if you recognize anyone.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.971
Does this have something
to do with Eric's death?

17:15.760 --> 17:17.125
Take your time.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.528
No, I don't recognize him.
This one?

17:28.200 --> 17:29.964
Nope.
How about this one?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.321
He looks familiar.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.481
VIKTOR: His name's Meisner.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.006
He's from Berlin.
Have you met him?

17:46.320 --> 17:48.971
No, I think I'd remember
if I had.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.764
We believe all three
of these gentlemen

17:50.880 --> 17:52.530
are associated with
a friend of yours.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.290
Sean Renard.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.326
That makes sense.

17:59.880 --> 18:02.042
I think Sean was
in Vienna recently.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.527
There was a note in my
room, signed by him.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.490
Did you see him?

18:10.640 --> 18:11.971
No.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.966
Mmm.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.851
Would you be so kind as to
tell me what the note said?

18:19.160 --> 18:20.207
Of course.

18:27.280 --> 18:32.525
Sean thinks that he may have
found out who killed my mother.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.126
Someone killed your mother?
How tragic.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.123
Yes. I'm still
dealing with it.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.601
Somebody here in Vienna
killed your mother?

18:39.720 --> 18:42.690
No, Portland. Sean
thinks it was the Grimm.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.570
It always comes back
to the Grimm, doesn't it?

18:45.680 --> 18:47.205
We didn't exactly get along.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.801
(GASPING)

18:50.520 --> 18:51.931
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING IN PAIN)

18:53.960 --> 18:56.486
Well, I believe we're done here.

18:56.560 --> 19:00.281
Thank you so much for coming.
Fraulein.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.324
What do you think?

19:06.400 --> 19:09.244
She did admit to getting
a note from Sean Renard.

19:09.360 --> 19:10.850
Given the threat
he's under here in Vienna,

19:10.960 --> 19:14.009
why would he chance leaving a note
for Adalind about her mother?

19:14.080 --> 19:15.923
Could he know she's pregnant?

19:16.080 --> 19:20.290
If he does, I wonder if he knows
she's carrying Eric's child.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.926
If it is Eric's child.

19:23.240 --> 19:27.040
Adalind returned to Portland
last year at Eric's request.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.851
From what I've learned
about Captain Renard,

19:29.920 --> 19:32.730
he not only had a relationship
with Fraulein Schade

19:32.800 --> 19:34.802
but with her mother as well.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.484
That's sort of impressive.

19:41.560 --> 19:44.803
Wouldn't it gum up the works if
she were carrying Sean's child

19:44.880 --> 19:46.166
rather than Eric's?

19:46.760 --> 19:50.287
Either way, the child
would be royal born.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.124
Maybe your failure to kill Sean

19:54.200 --> 19:55.929
was not such
a bad thing after all.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.250
It might behoove us to find
out who the father is.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.969
Sooner rather than later.

20:04.760 --> 20:08.242

and after every meal for seven days.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.651

20:11.400 --> 20:12.811
Thanks very much
for your business.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.530
Hey. I didn't think you
were coming in this early.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.926
Neither did I, but good news.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.286
Just wanted to let you know...

20:21.360 --> 20:22.600
What?

20:23.240 --> 20:25.527
Called my folks and told
them we're getting married.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.566
(SOFTLY) on.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.528
How'd that go?
Actually, pretty well.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.125
I have to say,
they were very excited.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.804
You know, my dad wanted
to know how old you were

20:35.920 --> 20:37.445
and how much money you make.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.010
Seriously?
Yeah.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.282
My dad's very...
Kind of old-fashioned.

20:41.360 --> 20:45.046
Sort of on the blunt side. Some people
are charmed, others are alarmed.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.004
Okay, so when am
I gonna meet them?

20:48.160 --> 20:49.685
Oh, there's no hurry.

20:50.280 --> 20:53.329
And by "no hurry" I mean
the later, the better.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.564

Hi, Mom.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.289
Oh, we're so excited
about you getting married

21:07.360 --> 21:09.124
that we're coming out tomorrow.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.680
We'll be there by 5:30. Don't
worry about picking us up.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.250
Uh, we're renting a car.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.129
Get that extra room
ready for us, though,

21:15.200 --> 21:16.440
'cause we're spending
the whole weekend...

21:16.520 --> 21:17.601
Okay, that's...
...with you.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.125
Your father and I can't wait
to meet your bride-to-be.

I'm glad...

to meet you tomorrow.

21:28.200 --> 21:32.125
Oh, wow, okay. I guess
that's good, right?

21:32.200 --> 21:34.043
They're staying with us.
In the house?

21:34.120 --> 21:36.000
In Nick's room. They always
stay in Nick's room.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.280
I mean, it was their room
before it was Nick's room.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.368
Oh, my God!
We have so much to do!

21:39.440 --> 21:42.205
Please tell me that they
know we're living together.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.044

21:51.680 --> 21:53.284
Can you talk?

21:55.960 --> 21:57.485
Where are you?

21:57.600 --> 21:58.761
In the city.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.687
Danilov was with Viktor
for several hours.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.249
When I brought Adalind
into the room,

22:04.800 --> 22:09.169
I saw photos of Frenay,
Tavitian and Meisner.

22:10.640 --> 22:13.086
Were you in the room
when they questioned her?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.928
How long did they keep her?

22:16.240 --> 22:18.004
Just a few minutes.

22:19.080 --> 22:22.243
Viktor may be getting ready
to make a move on Adalind.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.287
We can't afford
to let them get to her first.

22:25.920 --> 22:29.561
Tell Meisner,
he'll know what to do.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.406
I don't know. I crossed
everything off the list.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.363
Maybe I forgot
to put it on the list.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.204
I'm sorry.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.685
I'm stressing.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.728
Look, a little stress
is to be expected

24:32.800 --> 24:34.245
when you meet parents
for the first time.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.249
I mean, they're my parents
and I'm a little stressed.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.966
My stomach's in knots. Are you
sure they like bratwurst?

24:39.080 --> 24:41.162
Oh, my God, huge bratwurst fans.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.880
You don't even have
to cook it for my dad.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.725
You just light a match under
it and throw it on the floor.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.166
Oh, this is all
happening too fast.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.240
I just wish they would've
given us a bit more time.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.050
So what should I call them, huh?
Mom and Dad?

24:53.120 --> 24:55.805
Oh, no, I think, Bart and
Alice should be fine.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.561
Okay. Not overly formal.
Are they traditional?

25:00.240 --> 25:01.526
Traditional?

25:01.600 --> 25:04.729
Um, yeah, I guess, in some ways.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.651
What have you
told them about me?

25:08.480 --> 25:10.084
Well...

25:11.920 --> 25:13.843
Your name and...

25:13.920 --> 25:16.287
Wow, first and last?

25:17.320 --> 25:19.049
Look“.

25:21.120 --> 25:26.001
I told them you're great and
beautiful and that I love you.

25:27.080 --> 25:30.368
But have I provided
them with a complete,

25:30.440 --> 25:32.442
you know,
Rosalee history? No.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.961
It's probably better,
considering my checkered past.

25:36.080 --> 25:40.130
Believe me, their past is far
from checker-free, so...

25:40.200 --> 25:44.046
You sure they weren't hoping
to meet a nice Blutbaden girl?

25:45.800 --> 25:46.801
Oh...

25:48.440 --> 25:52.240
I think, you know, if I'm
happy, they'll be happy.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.328
You keep saying that,
but they're old-fashioned.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.129
What about us living together?

25:56.280 --> 25:57.850
Look, they're
old-fashioned, okay?

25:57.920 --> 25:59.046
They're not Neanderthals.

25:59.160 --> 26:02.323
Although my great-uncle
Wilhelm had a forehead

26:02.400 --> 26:03.811
the size of, like, Gibraltar.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.451
Here, flip those pillows.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.761
I just don't want them thinking
that I'm taking advantage of you.

26:07.840 --> 26:08.841
What?

26:09.000 --> 26:10.560
Single woman moves in
with single man...

26:10.600 --> 26:13.570
Some people might look at that
and think that I seduced you.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.120
(SCOFFS) Honey, there
is nothing in the world

26:16.200 --> 26:17.690
that would make them think that.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.001
Um...

26:26.200 --> 26:27.850
That's what I forgot.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.728

I'm in the kitchen.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.001
(OPENS BOTTLE)

26:35.000 --> 26:36.570
But not for long. Hey.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.802
So I got an email from your mom.
I just finished tracking her

26:38.880 --> 26:42.009
to Kerkira, which is on the
Greek border of Albania,

26:42.160 --> 26:43.730
but she's not there anymore.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.924
How do you know?
'Cause she's heading north.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.963
Here, will you take a look at
this and tell me what you think?

26:48.400 --> 26:50.528
Sounds like you were doing
a pretty good job yourself.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.961
No, there's more. Look.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.647
NICK: "Juliette,
good you have recovered.

26:55.720 --> 26:59.566
"Tell That would be me.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.165
Yeah, yeah, I got that.

27:01.240 --> 27:04.449
"Money not spent. Has been
deposited for safekeeping."

27:04.560 --> 27:06.403
I mean, those are the coins
you told me about, right?

27:06.560 --> 27:07.766
Yeah.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.127
That means she didn't
make it to Zakynthos.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.571
But she's hidden them
somewhere, hopefully safe.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.524
"Weather too hot now."

27:16.600 --> 27:19.524
That probably means somebody
is on to her, but who?

27:19.600 --> 27:22.206
I don't know. I mean, she's made
a lot of enemies over the years.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.761
"Returning north to find L."

27:25.840 --> 27:27.524
Yeah, who's "L"?

27:27.600 --> 27:29.762
Probably the Laufer?

27:30.400 --> 27:32.164
The Resistance,
the groups of people

27:32.240 --> 27:33.730
who are uniting
against the Royals.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.081

up to speed with this myself.

"in an unsecured

27:50.280 --> 27:52.282
I don't think that
this is a good idea.

27:52.760 --> 27:55.001
Why not? This could be a way
to protect both of you.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.320
Yeah, with you in the middle?
I'm already in the middle.

27:57.560 --> 27:59.289
And don't forget, I got in
a lot of trouble before

27:59.360 --> 28:00.964
because of things I didn't know.

28:01.240 --> 28:04.767
Look, you have to be very
careful how you deal with this.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.446
I know.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.570
The body was discovered a couple
hours ago by the street cleaner.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.802
No surveillance anywhere
on this street.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.008
Well, money's here.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.524
Name's Lee Mull.

28:17.600 --> 28:21.241
This guy's a Green Beret, so whoever
took him down had to be good.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.810
In a really bad way.

28:22.880 --> 28:25.963
Another guy in a uniform, scalped.

got an issue with authority.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.763
Well, at least we know
he's in Portland now.

HANK: No witnesses.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.641
The only thing we know for sure is
the make and the year of the car.

28:46.720 --> 28:48.131
And the pattern of victims.

28:48.200 --> 28:50.646

the Oregon highway patrol.

28:51.200 --> 28:55.046
Federales in Mexico reported two
similar killings in the last 10 days.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.329
The victims were scalped.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.403
One was an army officer
in Mazatlán.

28:59.480 --> 29:02.484
The other was identified as a
police officer in San Luis Potosí.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.722
Patrol officer spotted a car
matching the description.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.770
2011 Dodge Challenger parked
on Stark in the southwest.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.842
Make sure the officer knows
not to get near that vehicle

29:09.920 --> 29:10.921
and to stay back.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.002

five miles from our first scalping
victim, the border patrol guard.

In fact, Mr. Cervantes,
the owner of the Challenger,

may be another victim
who hasn't been found.

the original was in Latin,

What? No, I'm not ready for them.
Look at me!

38:27.880 --> 38:30.247
No, honey, you look beautiful.

38:30.320 --> 38:31.526
Just have to get rid of this.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.166
And this.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.245
Really.
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

38:36.880 --> 38:38.803
This is the first
impression I get to make.

38:38.920 --> 38:40.081
It's gonna be fine.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.321
(INHALES DEEPLY)

38:41.400 --> 38:42.845
You're beautiful.

38:43.560 --> 38:45.767
You're wonderful. You're
gonna knock 'em out.

38:47.920 --> 38:49.251
(CLOCK TICKING)
Do you hear that?

38:50.640 --> 38:52.529
His Gilbert Front
Mount's out of sync.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.768
Leave his clocks alone.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.807
I think I detect
a woman's touch.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.041
Yeah.

39:04.320 --> 39:08.041
Mom, Dad, this is my
fiancée, Rosalee.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.607
Honey, these are my parents,
Bart and Alice.

39:10.680 --> 39:11.761
Oh...

39:11.920 --> 39:15.322
Rosalee, it's so
very nice to meet you.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.323
I'm sorry I didn't have
a chance to get cleaned up.

39:17.400 --> 39:20.563
Oh, nonsense. You look just
as beautiful as he said.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.251
(LAUGHS)

39:23.640 --> 39:24.641
(GASPS)

39:26.640 --> 39:28.051
My turn.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.201
Come here.

39:31.800 --> 39:32.801
(GROANS)

39:33.200 --> 39:34.770
No, no, no, no.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.490
A Fuchsbau?

39:36.960 --> 39:39.850
What the hell is going on here?

39:40.800 --> 39:41.801
(SNARLS)

39:42.200 --> 39:43.247
Oh...

39:43.600 --> 39:44.965
(GROWLS)

39:47.320 --> 39:49.288
Monroe, are you
out of your mind?

39:49.360 --> 39:50.486
She's a Fuchsbau.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.768
You didn't tell them? You
were supposed to tell them.

39:52.840 --> 39:54.763
I was going to, but
they're, like, here now,

39:54.840 --> 39:56.569
and I didn't think
it was important.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.290
You guys don't think
it's important, do you?

39:58.360 --> 40:00.727
Well, it's just
a little unsettling.

40:00.800 --> 40:01.926
BART: (SCOFFS) More than
a little unsettling.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.525
This is never going to work.

40:03.640 --> 40:05.529
What are you talking about?
It is working.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.126
Don't be ridiculous. You can
sleep with anything, but...

40:08.200 --> 40:11.044
You have a problem because I'm a
Fuchsbau and your son is Blutbaden?

40:11.120 --> 40:12.167
Seriously?

40:12.240 --> 40:16.211
Well, dear, you can't pretend to
be blind to the situation here.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.084
BART: It's pretty
obvious they are.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.525
Wait until they start
living together.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.045
We are living together.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.763
Wait, you haven't
told them that either?

40:23.840 --> 40:25.524
It's really none of
their business, okay?

40:25.600 --> 40:26.965
I'm sorry, it's none
of your business.

40:27.080 --> 40:28.320
How can you say that?

40:28.400 --> 40:30.084
I'll tell you how
they can say that.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.364
Because they're breaking
the natural law

40:32.440 --> 40:34.681
and they don't care
about the consequences.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.525
What the hell's gonna happen
when you have children?

40:36.640 --> 40:39.291
I'm sorry. I cannot
listen to this ignorance.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.089
I'm leaving. That's
probably a good idea.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.447
What? No. Rosalee!

40:44.840 --> 40:46.126
What have you done?

40:46.200 --> 40:47.361
BART: This is outrageous!

40:47.880 --> 40:49.450
My own flesh and blood.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.090
I don't know what to say.

40:51.680 --> 40:53.967
Rosalee, you can't leave.
Yes, I can.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.326
But I don't care
what they think.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.480
I only care what you think.

40:56.520 --> 40:58.090
I think there's
a bigger problem here.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.969
This is something you have to
figure out with your parents,

41:00.040 --> 41:01.530
and you need to
do that without me.

41:04.480 --> 41:05.891
Rosalee...
No.

41:05.960 --> 41:07.564
I need some time with this.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.122
What the hell is
wrong with you two?

41:13.240 --> 41:14.651
What is wrong with us?
What is wrong with you?

41:14.720 --> 41:16.085
This is not right!

41:16.200 --> 41:18.009
You should've told us
before we came.

41:18.120 --> 41:20.851
Honestly, I didn't think this kind
of stuff still mattered to you.

41:20.920 --> 41:24.720
We've seen how these relationships
tear families apart.

41:24.840 --> 41:27.286
And look what this is...
(SNARLS) Doing to us already.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.404
Oh, Bart. Don't go there.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.130
Rosalee and I are in love,

41:31.400 --> 41:35.121
and we are getting married no
matter what you say or try to do.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.964
This is getting way out of hand.

41:37.040 --> 41:39.042
You need to listen to
what we are telling you!

41:39.120 --> 41:41.566
You touch me again, I swear to God...
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

41:42.400 --> 41:43.765
Thank God. She's back.

41:43.880 --> 41:46.850
You do not say a word
unless it's to apologize.

41:46.920 --> 41:49.366
I'm not apologizing for
what's right. Bart.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.327
Rosalee... Oh, Nick. Crap.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.686
I just saw Rosalee drive away.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.205
You okay in here?
Who is this?

41:55.280 --> 41:57.362
Rosalee left, which is what I
think you two should do now.

41:57.440 --> 41:58.726
Oh, we need to stop this.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.689
We go, we are not coming back.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.046
That's fine with me, Dad.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.125
Enough! We're done.

42:04.320 --> 42:06.163
He needs to figure out
who he is!

42:07.600 --> 42:09.170
(GROWLING)

42:09.600 --> 42:10.840
(SNARLING)

42:10.920 --> 42:12.206
A Grimm!

42:12.280 --> 42:13.770
Mom, Dad, no!

42:13.840 --> 42:14.841
(GROWLING)

42:14.960 --> 42:16.041
No!

42:16.120 --> 42:17.724
(SNARLING CONTINUES)
