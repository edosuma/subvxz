{\an1}Oh, my life is so good
right now.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.476
Actually, all of our lives are
just about perfect right now.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.811
You're happy with Dane.

Don't tempt the evil eye.

{\an3}In Poland, my mother said,
"Everything is perfect."

the Nazis invaded.

Oh, my God.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.768
He had a doll made
to look like himself?

That is the most disturbing
thing I have ever seen,

01:02.103 --> 01:05.022

Did you get my gift?

Not yet. Can't wait.

What's wrong with your head?

01:48.650 --> 01:51.361
Oh, I--I banged it real bad.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.238
Just like Little Bob.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.200
Actually,
can you hang on a second?

01:57.283 --> 01:59.202
I'm just gonna run
and get some ice.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.205
Wow, that is really weird.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.082
What if everything that happens
to Little Bob

02:04.165 --> 02:08.544
happens to slightly larger Bob?

02:08.627 --> 02:10.547
Maybe it's a voodoo doll.

to everyone around her,

"Why not make her British?"

I can think of.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.621
Who Got Cut
from Some Dopey HBO Show."

19:24.705 --> 19:26.915
{\an3}No, you're right.
That show was dopey.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.751
{\an3}I mean, why am I letting that
get me down?

19:29.835 --> 19:33.213
{\an3}I want to be that actress that
you remember from back then.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.924
Yeah, stupid and fearless.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.218
{\an3}Okay, you just give me
another chance,

19:38.302 --> 19:42.431
{\an3}and I think I could be
that stupid again.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.725
I know you can.

19:51.189 --> 19:54.151
{\an3}Dane. Hi.
What are you doing here?

19:54.234 --> 19:56.612
I came here
because you're here.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.406
{\an3}But you broke up with me
three days ago.

19:59.489 --> 20:03.118
Why was that again?

20:03.201 --> 20:04.786
Because I drugged you
with female hormones

20:04.870 --> 20:07.956
and then lied about it.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.751
Stuff happens.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.753
Don't worry.
It's out of my system now.

20:12.836 --> 20:16.298
Well, great. Great.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.841
Listen, I--I know I did wrong,

20:17.925 --> 20:19.635
{\an3}and we really should
talk about it,

20:19.718 --> 20:22.971
{\an3}because if you can't have trust
in a relationship and--

20:23.055 --> 20:24.806
- Oh, my God.
- What?

20:24.890 --> 20:26.308
{\an3}You weren't even listening
to me.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.809
You were staring at my chest.

20:27.893 --> 20:28.602
You're back!
