[woman speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

01:33.221 --> 01:34.805
[soft clanging]

01:37.933 --> 01:39.310
Hello?

01:39.394 --> 01:40.645
Hello?

01:45.108 --> 01:48.153
Where's Caputo?
I need to speak with him.

01:48.236 --> 01:49.820
-Take the tray, inmate.
-But... [sighs]

01:49.904 --> 01:51.281
Take the tray.

01:53.533 --> 01:55.493
My son's birthday's comin' up.

01:56.744 --> 01:58.037
Or... or it passed.

01:58.121 --> 01:59.414
What day is it?

02:02.125 --> 02:03.334
[sighs]

02:48.546 --> 02:50.005
I slept on it like you said.

02:50.089 --> 02:53.133
Took a nice cold shower.
Did some of those breathing exercises.

02:55.928 --> 02:56.971
And?

02:57.054 --> 02:58.681
I still think we should kill her.

02:58.764 --> 03:01.726
What? No!
No, that was, like...

03:01.809 --> 03:03.936
the opposite conclusion
you were supposed to come to.

03:04.019 --> 03:06.981
Well, clearly,
you're a sensitive Sally on this one.

03:07.064 --> 03:08.608
I'll do it myself.

03:08.691 --> 03:10.526
Now, where are my gloves?

03:10.610 --> 03:15.656
Okay, listen, Lolly is batshit bonkers.
Fine, I'll give you that.

03:15.740 --> 03:17.992
But she wasn't gonna
actually dig up everything.

03:18.075 --> 03:19.619
Oh, you think she was diggin' for gold?

03:19.702 --> 03:22.705
Who the fuck knows?
I don't know. She's weird.

03:22.788 --> 03:24.749
Maybe... maybe she was checking
on the decomposition.

03:24.832 --> 03:27.627
-Ah! Found 'em!
-[sighs]

03:27.710 --> 03:30.087
Look, I can handle Lolly.

03:30.170 --> 03:31.256
No, you can't.

03:32.172 --> 03:34.467
She's got too many loose screws.

03:34.550 --> 03:37.595
Like my cousin Arlene,
after they kidnapped her,

03:37.678 --> 03:39.889
put her in a truck,
and gave her a pickax lobotomy.

03:39.972 --> 03:41.724
-Oh, my...
-But...

03:41.807 --> 03:43.643
before she went blonde,

03:43.726 --> 03:45.811
that helped with her self-esteem a little.

03:45.895 --> 03:48.481
-She saved my life!
-Yeah.

03:49.357 --> 03:52.360
We are talking about...
[whispers] murdering someone.

03:53.110 --> 03:54.737
A human being.

03:54.820 --> 03:55.905
Again.

03:55.988 --> 03:57.990
[sighs] Oh, my God,
all the blood.

03:58.073 --> 03:59.784
Who said anything about blood?

03:59.867 --> 04:02.745
This time it's gonna be nice and clean.

04:03.663 --> 04:05.498
You ever hear of oleander?

04:08.918 --> 04:10.753
[inmates talking indistinctly]

04:10.836 --> 04:13.256
-Hey!
-Whoa! Fifteen.

04:13.339 --> 04:14.757
-In a row?
-Yup.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.134
Suffering Sappho!
You're good.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.511
You're quotin' Wonder Woman?

04:18.594 --> 04:20.596
Now, isn't that a little bit
before your time?

04:20.680 --> 04:23.558
Come on. All the comic book nerds
know the lingo.

04:23.641 --> 04:25.351
And I used to jerk off to her
when I was 12.

04:26.185 --> 04:27.312
And 27.

04:27.395 --> 04:29.397
You bad boy. [chuckles]

04:29.480 --> 04:31.023
William Moulton Marston,

04:31.106 --> 04:33.859
who created Wonder Woman,
had two wives.

04:34.652 --> 04:38.614
-See, why do you know that?
-Well, call me a polyamory expert.

04:38.698 --> 04:39.907
Yeah. I forgot.

04:39.990 --> 04:42.034
The whole boyfriend-and-husband thing.

04:42.117 --> 04:45.705
But now, those three were into bondage,
very kinky stuff.

04:45.788 --> 04:49.041
That is why Wonder Woman
was always chained up,

04:49.124 --> 04:51.544
trapped in cages, hog-tied.

04:51.627 --> 04:53.421
Kinda like how I spent my thirties.

04:53.504 --> 04:54.505
[chuckles]

04:54.589 --> 04:56.799
[humming]

05:00.470 --> 05:02.137
Hey, <i>blanco grande,</i>
you work here.

05:02.221 --> 05:04.307
-Yo, I need <i>audifonos,</i> headphones.
-And deodorant.

05:04.390 --> 05:07.393
The roll-on kind, not that spray shit.
It's bad for the environment.

05:07.477 --> 05:10.605
These look like spider bites to you?
Or you think it's shingles?

05:11.439 --> 05:13.023
They don't really itch, just hurt,

05:13.107 --> 05:14.692
you know,
like I got poison in my head.

05:14.775 --> 05:16.819
-You should go to medical.
-What about us?

05:16.902 --> 05:19.780
-We need stuff.
-You can buy stuff at commissary.

05:19.864 --> 05:21.407
With what money?
We don't got jobs.

05:21.491 --> 05:23.618
Hey, don't look at me.
If there's no work assignments,

05:23.701 --> 05:25.995
I can't very well
hand out work, now, can I?

05:26.078 --> 05:29.164
There is work,
but you only got it for the OG inmates.

05:29.248 --> 05:31.334
Hey, look at it this way.
Would you rather be scrubbing toilets?

05:31.417 --> 05:32.668
Maybe. Yeah.

05:32.752 --> 05:34.504
Better than sittin'
with our thumbs up our butt.

05:34.587 --> 05:37.548
Look, there's a lot of ways
to stay busy in prison, okay?

05:37.632 --> 05:39.925
You can read a book,
you can watch educational television.

05:40.009 --> 05:42.637
You have to learn
how to help yourselves in here.

05:44.722 --> 05:46.265
[Luschek and Judy laughing]

05:47.266 --> 05:50.310
[Luschek] Bad guy with the crazy hair...

05:50.395 --> 05:53.022
You know, there's... [chuckles]
There's nothing forbidden for you.

05:53.105 --> 05:54.482
This scoundrel bothering you?

05:54.565 --> 05:57.610
Well, uh, no, honey.
[chuckles] No, he's not.

05:57.693 --> 05:58.944
But thanks.

06:04.283 --> 06:06.661
Careful there.
You got a lot of cream there.

06:06.744 --> 06:08.287
It can cause a lot of mucus.

06:10.873 --> 06:13.000
Oh, no.
We're not drinkin' it.

06:13.083 --> 06:16.295
No, we're flippin' it.
Tryin' to pass the time.

06:22.802 --> 06:24.554
[whispers] That is one strange man.

06:24.637 --> 06:26.346
Yeah, he's basically Dr. Psycho.

06:26.431 --> 06:28.182
Oh, oh, oh.
The one who hates women.

06:28.265 --> 06:29.600
-Yes! [laughs]
-Yes!

06:29.684 --> 06:30.851
[laughing]

06:34.897 --> 06:36.231
It wasn't my fault.

06:36.315 --> 06:38.568
Michael Chinchetta
was making fun of Mom.

06:38.651 --> 06:41.195
He called her a lesbian
who howls at the Moon.

06:42.237 --> 06:43.739
He also made fun of my haircut.

06:43.823 --> 06:45.450
He said I look like Dick Van Dyke.

06:45.533 --> 06:47.618
Dick Van Dyke is an American hero

06:47.702 --> 06:49.745
and Michael Chinchetta is a bully.

06:50.705 --> 06:51.747
Dad...

06:53.207 --> 06:54.459
what's a lesbian?

06:55.710 --> 06:57.377
[stutters] Lesbianism is...

06:58.463 --> 06:59.797
a disease.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.800
-Like what Mom has?
-No, it's different.

07:02.883 --> 07:04.760
Another kind of mental illness.

07:04.844 --> 07:06.637
So what does Mom have?

07:06.721 --> 07:08.514
Mom has a highly active imagination

07:08.598 --> 07:12.142
and it makes her see
and hear things that aren't there.

07:13.603 --> 07:15.646
-Like angels?
-Yes.

07:16.230 --> 07:18.441
And little people in the walls, and...

07:18.524 --> 07:20.485
sometimes, Roy Orbison.

07:22.194 --> 07:24.697
But I think this new treatment
is gonna change things.

07:27.492 --> 07:28.576
Bring her back to us.

07:28.659 --> 07:30.745
Am I gonna get Mom's disease?

07:30.828 --> 07:31.871
No.

07:32.913 --> 07:34.248
Only women get it.

07:34.331 --> 07:36.959
[young Healy] I hope she makes
her tuna-fish casserole tonight.

07:37.042 --> 07:39.587
-Or I can make it for her.
-[Dennis] Shh. Enough.

07:39.670 --> 07:41.005
[stutters] Here she comes.

07:42.256 --> 07:43.841
Why does she look like that?

07:44.759 --> 07:47.261
It's temporary.
Go help her get in the car.

07:50.430 --> 07:51.849
[speaking indistinctly]

07:51.932 --> 07:53.726
[inmates talking indistinctly]

07:57.897 --> 07:59.982
Maria... can I talk to you?

08:00.065 --> 08:02.568
[in Spanish] How come
Fruit of the Loom never tried to hire me?

08:02.652 --> 08:04.194
[in English]
I understood most of that.

08:05.445 --> 08:08.282
And I would be happy to speak with you
if you are truly interested.

08:08.365 --> 08:09.449
[scoffs]

08:09.534 --> 08:11.827
[imitates barking]

08:12.828 --> 08:14.246
[Blanca imitates whimpering]

08:18.501 --> 08:21.170
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

08:22.713 --> 08:23.881
I wanted to give you a heads-up

08:23.964 --> 08:25.716
about that girl
you've been hanging out with.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.176
I hang out with a lot of girls.

08:27.259 --> 08:28.385
She's new.

08:29.428 --> 08:31.430
Medium height, cheeks?

08:31.514 --> 08:32.765
Cheeky-cheeks.

08:33.933 --> 08:35.809
I've been doing palace of the mind
to try and remember things.

08:35.893 --> 08:37.727
-Her name is a board game.
-Ouija.

08:37.812 --> 08:39.522
Yes. Yes.

08:40.397 --> 08:43.025
Anyway... I thought you should know,

08:43.107 --> 08:46.320
I saw your friend
stealing scraps of panties.

08:48.948 --> 08:50.032
And?

08:50.115 --> 08:51.576
And she can't do that.

08:51.659 --> 08:53.410
[chuckles]

08:53.493 --> 08:56.747
Well, you don't have a copyright
on the dirty-underwear business.

08:56.831 --> 08:58.833
Maybe other people have plans.

08:59.959 --> 09:01.460
I'm sorry. Are you...

09:05.089 --> 09:06.716
You don't even have the infrastructure.

09:06.799 --> 09:08.383
-How hard could it be?
-How hard?

09:08.467 --> 09:10.720
There's a website to maintain,
and couriers,

09:10.803 --> 09:12.638
not to mention brand identity,
client lists,

09:12.722 --> 09:14.974
payment. You can't...
I'm... I'm not...

09:15.057 --> 09:18.310
Wait... I'm not revealing
trade secrets to you.

09:18.393 --> 09:19.687
You're my competition now.

09:19.770 --> 09:21.230
We finished here?

09:21.313 --> 09:24.942
Maria, I urge you to stop
and think about this.

09:25.025 --> 09:26.944
One illegal business is dangerous.

09:27.027 --> 09:29.572
Two businesses,
particularly one that's not well-run...

09:30.489 --> 09:32.116
it could expose all of us.

09:33.826 --> 09:35.995
I better run it real good then.

09:43.002 --> 09:45.129
-Hey. [chuckles]
-Hey.

09:52.052 --> 09:53.053
Hi.

09:55.055 --> 09:56.641
Can you keep a secret?

09:57.683 --> 09:59.476
[whispering] I love secrets.

10:00.394 --> 10:02.396
No disciplinary violations.

10:02.479 --> 10:04.940
No petty or serious infractions.

10:05.024 --> 10:08.903
I see a "loafing and shirking" comment,
but that's been crossed out.

10:08.986 --> 10:12.907
No work absences,
no noted fights with other inmates.

10:12.990 --> 10:18.621
Actually, I don't see
a single shot in two years.

10:18.704 --> 10:20.539
Looks like you've been a model inmate.

10:21.707 --> 10:22.750
That's me.

10:22.833 --> 10:25.044
Well, you're eligible for early release,

10:25.127 --> 10:27.087
so let's talk about
gettin' you out of here.

10:27.171 --> 10:29.048
[breathes deeply]

10:31.759 --> 10:33.678
This is a shit secret.

10:33.761 --> 10:37.139
This is a secret that fucks
everyone who touches it.

10:37.222 --> 10:39.767
Yeah, well, tag. You're it.

10:41.435 --> 10:44.814
Are you sleeping?
How are you, psychologically?

10:44.897 --> 10:47.692
[chuckles] I'm a mess.

10:47.775 --> 10:51.070
What do you think? I've never--
I've never taken a life before.

10:51.153 --> 10:53.823
I'm just tryin' to get through the day
without vomiting every hour.

10:53.906 --> 10:56.742
You're too sensitive.
People like you shouldn't kill.

10:56.826 --> 10:58.452
Thanks for that great advice.

10:58.535 --> 10:59.912
And in my garden.

10:59.995 --> 11:01.538
Who do you think they'll blame, hmm?

11:01.621 --> 11:03.708
I'm your co-conspirator now.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.044
Is he under the tomatoes?

11:07.127 --> 11:08.921
Please, say he's not under the tomatoes.

11:09.004 --> 11:10.840
-I don't know. Maybe.
-Maybe?

11:10.923 --> 11:13.550
I was going to pickle those,
add a little sugar.

11:13.633 --> 11:16.846
[inhales sharply] I can't work
with these sacks of sludge.

11:16.929 --> 11:20.015
The only thing worse
than so-called "meat curry,"

11:20.099 --> 11:23.393
is fresh produce
fertilized with rotting flesh.

11:23.477 --> 11:24.561
You know, I didn't tell you

11:24.644 --> 11:26.063
so you could flip out
about your vegetables.

11:26.146 --> 11:28.190
So why did you leave
this flaming bag of dog shit

11:28.273 --> 11:29.441
on my doorstep, huh?

11:29.524 --> 11:30.776
You're not my daughter.

11:30.860 --> 11:32.444
You've never come to me for anything.

11:32.527 --> 11:33.779
You're right.

11:35.614 --> 11:37.783
You are the last person
I wanna trust

11:37.867 --> 11:40.494
with this fucking
albatross of a secret...

11:41.245 --> 11:42.747
but I need your help.

11:44.331 --> 11:46.500
Frieda wants to... kill Lolly.

11:46.583 --> 11:50.254
Literally... kill her,
and she won't listen to me.

11:51.713 --> 11:54.716
You're the resident Frieda-whisperer,
so... whisper.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.763
-Work your magic.
-[sighs]

12:02.682 --> 12:04.559
Has she tried anything yet?

12:04.643 --> 12:07.312
No, but she's making this poisonous tea

12:07.396 --> 12:09.648
out of these oleander leaves
she found out by the fence.

12:09.731 --> 12:11.191
Oh, those fucking leaves.

12:11.275 --> 12:14.820
She's been dying to use those.
Shit!

12:15.905 --> 12:18.740
Hello?
Uh, Litchfield Public Library?

12:19.741 --> 12:24.371
I'm calling from Jefferson,
um... Chemical.

12:24.454 --> 12:28.083
Our Internet is broken.
It is such a buzzkill.

12:28.167 --> 12:33.255
Would you mind looking up
a few urgent things for us?

12:35.424 --> 12:38.427
Great. Thank you so much.

12:39.219 --> 12:41.346
Yes. First question.

12:42.264 --> 12:44.349
Is Beyoncé really getting divorced?

12:44.433 --> 12:48.687
Because we read a real suspicious-sounding
article in <i>US Weekly,</i> and--

12:48.770 --> 12:49.939
Mr. Healy! [chuckles]

12:50.022 --> 12:52.482
-[woman] <i>Hello? Are you still--</i>
-Uh...

12:52.566 --> 12:55.777
how may I, uh, assist you
this fine afternoon?

12:55.861 --> 12:57.905
I wanna see Caputo.

12:57.988 --> 13:01.951
Well, his next availability,

13:02.034 --> 13:04.619
mmm-hmm, one second...

13:04.703 --> 13:07.747
is, mmm, in two weeks.

13:07.832 --> 13:09.374
You're kiddin' me, right?

13:09.458 --> 13:15.297
You know, Mr. Healy,
back in the day, it was real good...

13:16.340 --> 13:21.303
when we had plenty of time
to see you,

13:21.386 --> 13:23.848
but now, I...
[chuckles] I don't know.

13:23.931 --> 13:25.057
[exhales sharply]

13:25.140 --> 13:26.725
-[sighs]
-Really, huh?

13:26.808 --> 13:30.229
How about, uh...
two boxes of Good and Plenty?

13:30.312 --> 13:32.522
-Five.
-Three.

13:35.901 --> 13:36.944
[phone rings]

13:37.862 --> 13:39.529
[Taystee] Mr. Healy's here to see you.

13:39.613 --> 13:42.199
[sighs] Fuck.

13:43.075 --> 13:45.744
Outside, he's in Side Boob.

13:45.827 --> 13:47.872
In here, he's the head boob.

13:47.955 --> 13:49.248
If you want something,

13:49.331 --> 13:51.583
you might wanna start out
by not insulting me.

13:52.376 --> 13:54.753
[sighs] I'd like to talk to you
about inmate King.

13:54.836 --> 13:57.339
[exhales sharply] Good.

13:57.422 --> 13:58.423
What's the update?

13:58.507 --> 14:01.135
Well, unfortunately,
she's been hangin' out

14:01.218 --> 14:03.220
with some unsavory types.

14:03.303 --> 14:05.055
Hard to avoid in prison.

14:05.139 --> 14:07.724
I think it would be good
for her to stay busy. [sighs]

14:08.642 --> 14:09.643
I got an idea.

14:11.311 --> 14:12.729
Cooking class.

14:12.812 --> 14:14.940
We can't afford new equipment.

14:15.024 --> 14:16.901
Hey, she's very resourceful.

14:16.984 --> 14:18.527
I'm telling you,
I've seen the videos.

14:18.610 --> 14:21.363
She can take an olive jar
and turn it into a snow globe.

14:21.446 --> 14:23.740
And what about food?
And ingredients?

14:23.823 --> 14:25.200
Well, we got the garden.

14:25.284 --> 14:28.328
We got a bunch of those canned goods
in the expired earthquake kits.

14:28.412 --> 14:32.207
Ah, and if one inmate gets salmonella
from a ten-year-old sardine,

14:32.291 --> 14:33.708
it's my neck on the line.

14:33.792 --> 14:35.794
Hey, look, you gave Berdie
an improv troupe.

14:35.878 --> 14:39.464
I'm talkin' about a culinary-skills class
taught by a world-class chef.

14:39.548 --> 14:42.384
Everybody in here would want in.
You know that, Joe.

14:42.467 --> 14:43.552
Mmm-hmm.

14:44.469 --> 14:45.554
So what you're sayin' is

14:45.637 --> 14:47.973
you're gonna take
a bunch of restless inmates...

14:49.641 --> 14:51.643
keep them occupied
a couple of times a week.

14:51.726 --> 14:53.020
Correct-a-mundo.

14:54.897 --> 14:57.357
Fine then.
Yes, you have my blessing.

14:58.317 --> 15:00.110
Talk to Piscatella first.

15:00.694 --> 15:02.404
Aye, aye, el Caputano.

15:03.655 --> 15:04.823
Healy!

15:06.325 --> 15:07.326
Yeah?

15:08.118 --> 15:09.203
No knives.

15:09.286 --> 15:11.163
Obviously.

15:17.794 --> 15:19.046
What are you doing?

15:20.005 --> 15:21.256
I'm making breakfast.

15:21.340 --> 15:23.258
But it's the middle of the night.

15:23.342 --> 15:25.385
I couldn't sleep
and I wanted to keep my hands busy.

15:26.303 --> 15:27.387
Take a seat, kiddo.

15:31.808 --> 15:35.395
Deviled eggs and a side of tomato.

15:43.862 --> 15:45.864
Are you feeling better now?

15:45.948 --> 15:49.368
I am, especially now
that I'm with my little man.

15:51.620 --> 15:52.955
You're not hungry?

15:53.956 --> 15:55.332
I'm allergic to eggs.

15:56.041 --> 15:58.460
-What are you talking about?
-They make me itchy.

15:58.543 --> 16:00.129
I get a rash.

16:02.339 --> 16:03.465
Sorry.

16:04.883 --> 16:08.053
This new therapy...
it makes my brain a little skippy.

16:14.018 --> 16:15.102
[sighs]

16:16.561 --> 16:21.608
Actually... I was thinking about
stopping the treatments.

16:21.691 --> 16:23.693
They're very traumatic,

16:23.777 --> 16:26.571
the way they put these metal plates
on my head,

16:26.655 --> 16:28.782
and then, afterwards...

16:28.865 --> 16:31.368
it's like I've been erased.

16:31.451 --> 16:32.995
Does Dad know?

16:33.078 --> 16:34.413
I'm only telling you...

16:35.414 --> 16:37.749
because you understand me.

16:37.832 --> 16:39.543
You always have.

16:40.294 --> 16:42.879
Don't you want Mommy
to hear the angels again,

16:42.962 --> 16:44.131
to be happy?

16:44.214 --> 16:45.424
No.

16:45.507 --> 16:47.926
I think it's better
when you do the plates.

16:48.010 --> 16:49.761
I don't like it when you're crazy.

16:55.100 --> 16:57.936
Of course. You're right.

17:00.272 --> 17:01.690
[sprinkler hissing]

17:03.525 --> 17:04.526
You hear that?

17:05.402 --> 17:07.862
Oh, it's the sprinkler.

17:07.945 --> 17:10.115
Your father will be angry
if we leave it on all night.

17:11.241 --> 17:14.411
Finish your juice.
I'll go shut it off.

17:18.290 --> 17:20.416
[door opens and closes]

17:24.921 --> 17:26.631
[sprinkler continues hissing]

17:35.599 --> 17:36.683
Mom!

17:48.528 --> 17:49.863
Mom!

17:52.866 --> 17:54.076
Mom!

17:57.371 --> 17:59.998
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

18:08.340 --> 18:10.300
[guard] All right, ladies.
Shift's over.

18:10.384 --> 18:11.801
That's it. Let's go.

19:19.911 --> 19:20.954
[gags]

19:25.459 --> 19:26.501
Ugh!

19:28.002 --> 19:29.213
[retches]

19:34.759 --> 19:35.885
[sighs]

19:42.267 --> 19:43.477
[exhales]

19:52.444 --> 19:53.445
[grunts]

19:54.070 --> 19:55.489
What the fuck, Red?

19:55.572 --> 19:58.116
I know all about your plan
to poison the crazy girl.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.909
[scoffs]

19:59.993 --> 20:02.161
You think I'm that stupid?

20:02.246 --> 20:05.039
I'd carry a cup of death juice
in plain sight?

20:05.123 --> 20:06.666
-[sighs]
-That was coffee!

20:06.750 --> 20:07.751
Sure it was,

20:07.834 --> 20:10.837
and Rasputin had a sea cucumber
instead of a penis.

20:15.759 --> 20:16.760
Trust me!

20:17.427 --> 20:21.931
When I'm ready to make my move,
it's gonna be a lot less conspicuous.

20:22.682 --> 20:26.895
Can't mind your own business
for five goddamn minutes, can you, Red?

20:26.978 --> 20:28.230
Oh, I'll mind my own business

20:28.313 --> 20:31.316
when people stop
burying bodies in my garden.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.068
Now come... walk with me.

20:35.529 --> 20:38.031
Poison is beneath you, Frieda, huh?

20:38.114 --> 20:40.367
It's for witches and bored housewives,

20:40.450 --> 20:44.037
not badass biker chicks
with octopus tattoos.

20:44.954 --> 20:46.831
What can I say?
I'm gettin' old.

20:46.915 --> 20:48.583
Oh, you are. So am I.

20:48.667 --> 20:49.918
What's your point?

20:51.044 --> 20:53.046
I know where all the bodies are buried...

20:53.963 --> 20:56.508
not just the literal ones.

20:57.967 --> 20:59.636
I can't go back to Max.

21:00.554 --> 21:01.763
I'll die down there.

21:02.639 --> 21:05.767
If you poison that girl,
it'll get back to you,

21:05.850 --> 21:08.853
and you'll be lucky
if they give you Max.

21:10.021 --> 21:11.105
[Lolly yelling] Go! Get out of here!

21:11.189 --> 21:13.107
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

21:13.191 --> 21:15.777
Take cover right now!
Don't you come over here!

21:15.860 --> 21:18.237
-Go!
-Hey, don't shove me!

21:18.322 --> 21:19.781
I am not shoving.
I'm saving.

21:19.864 --> 21:21.950
There's a Hellfire missile
up there with your name on it.

21:22.033 --> 21:24.411
[Pidge] There's a Hellfire missile
that says "Ramona"?

21:24.494 --> 21:27.456
Yeah. Read about the Patriot Act.
It's all in there, girl.

21:27.539 --> 21:31.167
She's a broken cuckoo clock.
So? We already knew that.

21:31.250 --> 21:34.796
She can run her mouth off
to random inmates...

21:34.879 --> 21:38.007
but if she blabs to anyone
in real power,

21:38.091 --> 21:39.468
we're all dead.

21:40.802 --> 21:42.679
She's a problem, Red.

21:42.762 --> 21:45.349
I know it and you know it.

21:45.432 --> 21:47.309
-[knocking on door]
-Yes?

21:48.852 --> 21:52.564
-You rang?
-Oh, come in. Come in.

21:53.690 --> 21:56.234
I was just watching
a documentary on a sushi chef

21:56.318 --> 21:58.445
that works in a subway station.

22:00.364 --> 22:03.367
I don't eat sushi
and I don't take subways,

22:03.450 --> 22:05.619
but it's interesting to me.

22:06.745 --> 22:08.037
Oh, thank you.

22:10.374 --> 22:12.376
The pride he took in his work, you know?

22:14.919 --> 22:17.756
Anyways... I have some good news.

22:17.839 --> 22:19.674
My sentence has been commuted.

22:19.758 --> 22:21.217
[laughs]

22:22.218 --> 22:23.387
You're a funny criminal.

22:23.470 --> 22:25.304
-[chuckles]
-But no.

22:25.389 --> 22:27.724
[opens drawer]

22:27.807 --> 22:29.350
I pulled some strings...

22:31.144 --> 22:33.480
and I've arranged for you

22:33.563 --> 22:35.565
to lead a cooking class.

22:37.901 --> 22:39.027
I see.

22:41.946 --> 22:45.659
Thinking of calling it, the...
King of the Kitchen...

22:45.742 --> 22:49.245
-Ah.
-...or, um, "Le Cordon King." [chuckles]

22:49.328 --> 22:50.455
[laughs]

22:50.539 --> 22:52.957
Well, I hope this doesn't sound impolite,

22:53.041 --> 22:56.670
but I'd like to decline
your considerate offer.

22:57.921 --> 22:59.005
Is that so?

22:59.088 --> 23:00.549
No, I mean, by all means,
put me to work.

23:00.632 --> 23:02.551
I would love to learn a new trade,

23:02.634 --> 23:05.554
maybe plumbing
or... or electricals.

23:05.637 --> 23:10.684
Mmm, well, electrical is, uh...
poorly managed.

23:10.767 --> 23:13.687
Well, you choose.
You're the expert.

23:15.647 --> 23:17.231
You know, I've chosen.

23:18.357 --> 23:19.943
You know, these girls,
a lot of them,

23:20.026 --> 23:22.737
come from poor,
disadvantaged communities...

23:23.362 --> 23:26.407
and this class could make
a big difference for them.

23:26.491 --> 23:28.326
But I guess
you don't care about that, huh?

23:28.409 --> 23:29.410
Helping others?

23:30.244 --> 23:32.747
Oh, I do. I do.

23:34.123 --> 23:36.501
That's why I set up a scholarship fund

23:36.585 --> 23:39.128
for young chefs in rural Tennessee.

23:39.212 --> 23:43.049
It's why I do everything I can
to diversify all my kitchens.

23:43.132 --> 23:46.511
I sit on numerous boards,
volunteer, do PBS.

23:46.595 --> 23:49.889
So, forgive me if I want a respite.

23:51.641 --> 23:53.142
I'm sorry.

23:53.226 --> 23:56.062
This is what MCC
has decided is best for you.

24:00.066 --> 24:01.192
Of course.

24:02.443 --> 24:04.738
[sighs] Happy to oblige.

24:05.739 --> 24:06.740
Thank you.

24:14.288 --> 24:17.416
I liked the part, uh,
with the puppets...

24:17.501 --> 24:20.545
and when the woman
set the bishop on fire.

24:20.629 --> 24:22.756
Yeah, I didn't really get a lot of it.

24:22.839 --> 24:25.174
I didn't either,
but I think that's kinda, like,

24:25.258 --> 24:27.844
what this cultural thing is about,
you know?

24:27.927 --> 24:29.513
It's like AA.

24:29.596 --> 24:31.723
[stutters] Half the job
is just showin' up.

24:32.932 --> 24:35.852
Well, it's, um, it's late.
I should go home.

24:35.935 --> 24:37.812
Well, I... I got a car.
Let me give you a ride.

24:37.896 --> 24:39.063
It's okay. I'll get a cab.

24:40.398 --> 24:41.440
You didn't have fun?

24:42.692 --> 24:44.694
-I did.
-So?

24:45.403 --> 24:46.530
So...

24:47.947 --> 24:49.240
you're my therapist.

24:49.323 --> 24:51.284
Social worker, not therapist.

24:51.367 --> 24:53.161
It feels wrong.

24:53.244 --> 24:56.122
Hey, we're just two people,
trying to figure it out, you know?

24:57.373 --> 24:59.543
-I'm gonna go.
-Okay.

25:32.576 --> 25:33.577
Mom?

25:36.120 --> 25:38.497
It's me... Sam.

25:41.084 --> 25:42.168
Sam?

25:47.340 --> 25:48.675
[Taystee grunts]

25:49.801 --> 25:52.804
[sighs and blows raspberries]

25:52.887 --> 25:54.180
[grunts]

25:56.015 --> 25:57.141
Long day at the office?

25:57.225 --> 26:01.270
[sighs] First, I had to photocopy,
and alphabetize,

26:01.354 --> 26:03.231
all of the W2s for the new guards,

26:03.314 --> 26:06.525
which I then had to fax to
some chick named Heather at MCC

26:06.610 --> 26:08.612
and then some other chick
named Tonya at the BOP,

26:08.695 --> 26:11.906
so now I know
all the guards' middle names.

26:11.990 --> 26:14.200
Then, when I was supposed
to take my lunch break,

26:14.283 --> 26:17.203
Mr. Caputo needed help downloading
the latest version of Excel.

26:17.286 --> 26:19.080
Why? Because he's like a hundred years old

26:19.163 --> 26:21.708
and doesn't know how to use a computer,
which I don't either,

26:21.791 --> 26:23.251
but it's really not that hard, like...

26:23.334 --> 26:25.336
-[snaps fingers] common sense, people.
-Mmm.

26:25.419 --> 26:29.716
Oh, and then I had to fill out
an order form for order forms.

26:29.799 --> 26:31.300
So weird, right?

26:31.384 --> 26:34.137
Oh, and I got to eat this bar
that Caputo eats sometimes

26:34.220 --> 26:38.016
instead of food when he's really busy,
and it wasn't that bad.

26:38.099 --> 26:41.645
Had this weird color, and he said
I would probably have trouble poopin'.

26:41.728 --> 26:45.189
I need to get myself a yoga ball.

26:45.273 --> 26:47.566
Did you call the public library
like I asked?

26:48.652 --> 26:51.487
-I... I did.
-Oh! And?

26:52.405 --> 26:54.323
Go! Come on.
What'd they say?

26:54.407 --> 26:56.993
Are dragons covered in feathers,
like the dinosaurs,

26:57.076 --> 27:00.163
or are they covered in scales
like the Gorgons?

27:00.246 --> 27:02.791
You know...
they weren't quite sure.

27:02.874 --> 27:04.125
[grunts]

27:05.960 --> 27:08.880
With responsibility comes great power.

27:08.963 --> 27:10.548
Isn't it the other way around?

27:10.631 --> 27:13.301
No. Think about it.

27:13.927 --> 27:17.096
I will call the library people tomorrow,
Suzanne.

27:19.724 --> 27:21.475
[smacks lips] I promise.

27:27.691 --> 27:28.942
You got power now, right?

27:29.025 --> 27:30.068
-[whistles]
-[Taystee] Mmm-mmm.

27:30.151 --> 27:33.780
I got a desk. That's it.
And, like, a phone.

27:33.863 --> 27:36.115
And, like, the ear of the warden,
but that's it.

27:36.199 --> 27:38.785
So, if I needed something--

27:38.868 --> 27:41.162
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, no.

27:41.245 --> 27:43.957
Don't get me involved
in your Middle East bullshit.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.209
Hey, you got to share the love, homie.

27:46.292 --> 27:48.920
I mean, that's how black people
be gettin' ahead.

27:49.003 --> 27:50.296
-[Crazy Eyes] Mmm-hmm.
-Look at Obama.

27:50.379 --> 27:52.716
-Change.
-He got to be president,

27:52.799 --> 27:56.010
-so now the rest of us get to be--
-In prison.

27:56.094 --> 27:58.554
Oh! I forgot to tell y'all.

27:58.637 --> 28:01.474
I've got hella big news on Judy King.

28:01.557 --> 28:06.020
Yo, Poussey will lose her shit.
Where she at? [laughs]

28:06.562 --> 28:08.147
She busy.

28:09.148 --> 28:10.649
[Poussey] Well, you can't really do that.

28:10.734 --> 28:12.986
[chuckling] You can't control
what goes on in your dreams.

28:13.069 --> 28:14.821
-Uh, yeah, you can.
-What?

28:14.904 --> 28:16.697
It's called lucid dreaming.

28:16.781 --> 28:20.451
No. No, no, no. Lucid dreaming is
when you talk to yourself in your dreams.

28:20.534 --> 28:24.205
Like, "Hey, you. Wake up.
You didn't actually go to school naked."

28:24.288 --> 28:25.790
[giggles]

28:25.874 --> 28:27.250
Well, whatever it's called,

28:27.333 --> 28:32.338
you can totally curate pictures and themes
that go into your brain.

28:32.421 --> 28:35.299
Like your own private film festival.

28:35.383 --> 28:38.094
Doesn't that, sort of,
defeat the purpose of a dream?

28:38.177 --> 28:39.345
-Hmm.
-Like,

28:39.428 --> 28:41.347
it's supposed to be about surprises.

28:41.430 --> 28:43.892
Ugh! I don't like surprises.

28:43.975 --> 28:46.978
I like to be... in control.

28:47.061 --> 28:49.313
-That's funny 'cause...
-[chuckles]

28:49.397 --> 28:52.066
...I sort of like it
when you lose control.

28:52.150 --> 28:56.154
Like... when I do this.

28:58.364 --> 28:59.407
[moans]

28:59.490 --> 29:00.867
[chuckling]

29:01.785 --> 29:03.036
[both chuckling]

29:04.578 --> 29:06.039
[moaning]

29:07.791 --> 29:09.125
[moaning continues]

29:12.128 --> 29:13.671
[sighs]

29:13.755 --> 29:15.339
You got a problem down here with kites?

29:15.423 --> 29:16.925
No, sir.

29:18.301 --> 29:19.302
[toilet flushing]

29:24.348 --> 29:25.349
Burset.

29:25.433 --> 29:26.810
[water sloshing]

29:28.978 --> 29:31.815
I never thought I'd be happy
to see that mustache.

29:31.898 --> 29:33.024
You gotta get me out of here.

29:33.107 --> 29:36.986
Well, turning your cell into
a Russian bath is not helping your case.

29:37.070 --> 29:39.948
Flooding is a punishable offense.
You should know that.

29:40.031 --> 29:42.491
How else was I supposed to
get your attention?

29:42.575 --> 29:43.659
Well, you can ask for me.

29:43.742 --> 29:45.536
Are you kiddin' me?

29:45.619 --> 29:47.371
I've been shoutin' your name for months.

29:47.455 --> 29:49.332
Well, you have not been
down here that long.

29:49.415 --> 29:52.085
[scoffs] Easy for you to say.

29:52.168 --> 29:55.964
You haven't been thrown in a dungeon,
forgotten about.

29:56.923 --> 29:58.632
No one has forgotten about you.

29:58.716 --> 30:01.803
Sophia, you're a smart girl.

30:01.886 --> 30:04.848
You have to know
you're not helping yourself.

30:04.931 --> 30:06.850
You need to meet me halfway

30:06.933 --> 30:09.352
if we have any chance
of gettin' you out of here.

30:10.394 --> 30:12.230
I wanna talk to my wife.

30:12.313 --> 30:13.940
Tell her where I am.

30:16.234 --> 30:18.069
I've already spoken with Crystal.

30:18.152 --> 30:19.653
What?

30:19.737 --> 30:21.697
What... What'd she say?

30:22.406 --> 30:24.700
Well, she agrees with me.

30:24.783 --> 30:28.579
We need to wait for the right time
to return you to gen pop.

30:28.662 --> 30:30.206
She would never say that.

30:31.124 --> 30:32.666
You lyin'.

30:32.750 --> 30:34.085
Think about it.

30:35.003 --> 30:36.545
You're still in here,
aren't you?

30:43.136 --> 30:44.220
What are you doin'?

30:44.303 --> 30:45.972
Put your shirt back on!

30:47.098 --> 30:48.766
[Caputo] I advise you not--

30:51.019 --> 30:52.561
[flushing]

30:54.898 --> 30:57.150
[toilet gargling]

30:59.777 --> 31:01.946
Either you let me out of here,

31:02.030 --> 31:05.824
or I'm gonna keep flushin' this toilet
till I drown myself!

31:05.909 --> 31:07.826
You're doin' this to yourself.

31:08.744 --> 31:10.288
Remember that.

31:11.205 --> 31:12.665
[sighs]

31:16.961 --> 31:19.130
CO Schmuck-a-Fuck,
get over here.

31:19.213 --> 31:21.090
[inmate laughing] Schmuck-a-Fuck.

31:21.174 --> 31:23.801
Move Burset to a dry cell
before she gets hypothermia.

31:23.885 --> 31:25.219
Oh, but it's late.

31:25.303 --> 31:28.139
Uh, most of the COs are already gone.
It takes three for a move.

31:28.222 --> 31:29.682
I don't fucking care!

31:29.765 --> 31:31.350
You find people.

31:32.268 --> 31:35.438
This isn't Guantanamo.
Get her a fucking shirt!

31:36.355 --> 31:38.274
[inmate 1 snoring]

31:40.234 --> 31:41.485
[whispering] Hey.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.321
[whispering] What the fuck?

31:43.404 --> 31:45.031
Shh. It's me.

31:45.114 --> 31:46.407
Alex?

31:46.490 --> 31:47.992
-Shh.
-What are you doing?

31:48.076 --> 31:49.743
Come talk to me in the bathroom.

31:49.827 --> 31:54.332
You haven't said more than
"hi" to me... in days,

31:54.415 --> 31:57.126
and now you want some kind of
a middle-of-the-night confab?

31:57.210 --> 31:58.794
I don't wanna talk.

31:58.877 --> 32:00.964
Is this a booty call?

32:01.047 --> 32:03.091
-Come find out.
-Why?

32:03.174 --> 32:04.883
Why are you doing this now?

32:04.968 --> 32:06.970
God, you really know how to dry a girl up.

32:07.053 --> 32:09.055
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

32:09.973 --> 32:11.140
I thought that you hated me.

32:11.224 --> 32:12.766
I do.

32:13.601 --> 32:15.353
What's going on?

32:15.436 --> 32:16.980
Nothing.

32:17.646 --> 32:19.773
I just... I have insomnia.

32:20.649 --> 32:23.277
If something's up,
you can tell me.

32:25.321 --> 32:26.447
It's cool.

32:28.449 --> 32:29.783
Good night, Pipes.

32:40.294 --> 32:41.587
[inmate 2 sobbing]

32:43.006 --> 32:44.673
[indistinct chatter]

32:45.549 --> 32:48.136
I can't believe they're letting her
teach a class,

32:48.219 --> 32:50.679
as if she weren't entitled enough.

32:50.763 --> 32:53.016
-You get to teach a class.
-It's different.

32:53.099 --> 32:54.392
Don't seem so different.

32:54.475 --> 32:56.019
Well, it is.

32:56.102 --> 32:59.772
Yoga is a democratic practice.
Anyone can do it.

32:59.855 --> 33:02.483
Learning to curl zucchini ribbons
is rarified.

33:02.566 --> 33:07.321
You do realize that only rich,
white people do yoga, right?

33:07.405 --> 33:08.572
[laughs]

33:08.656 --> 33:10.408
And the billions of Indian people

33:10.491 --> 33:13.327
who have been practicing it
for over 5,000 years?

33:13.411 --> 33:14.787
How about them?

33:15.704 --> 33:17.540
I'm working through some issues.

33:17.623 --> 33:19.250
-Question.
-[Crazy Eyes] Mmm.

33:20.126 --> 33:23.171
Do we still think Judy King a racist
or is she just Southern?

33:23.254 --> 33:26.299
-Mmm, I don't know.
-Speaking of racist.

33:28.884 --> 33:30.011
Can you guys make room?

33:30.094 --> 33:31.262
[Crazy Eyes sighs]

33:32.221 --> 33:35.349
-Yeah. Uh...
-[Crazy Eyes chuckles]

33:37.393 --> 33:38.394
[sighs]

33:39.353 --> 33:41.064
-Hi. I'm Alison.
-[Poussey] Hmm.

33:45.901 --> 33:46.902
[whispers] Suzanne.

33:46.985 --> 33:51.199
Uh... it's not
Bring Your Stranger to Work Day.

33:51.282 --> 33:54.077
-Poussey got Oriental Trading over there.
-[inmates chuckling]

33:54.160 --> 33:56.037
Yeah, I think <i>Final Call</i> here
is a little different.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.289
Come on, man. Chill.

33:58.372 --> 34:02.501
Uh, Alison... do you have hair?

34:02.585 --> 34:05.629
I do. I cover it for modesty.

34:05.713 --> 34:08.757
I got a cousin who lives in Modesto.

34:08.841 --> 34:10.967
That's, like, modest with an "O."

34:11.052 --> 34:16.224
We were just conversing about Judy
and how sick her class gonna be.

34:16.306 --> 34:17.516
-[all laughing]
-[Black Cindy] Yeah, yo!

34:17.600 --> 34:19.476
You guys are a bunch of suckers.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.355
I mean, come on. You really think
that class is gonna change stuff?

34:22.438 --> 34:23.647
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-No, man.

34:23.731 --> 34:26.775
We still gonna be bussin' tables and
flippin' burgers when we get out of here.

34:26.859 --> 34:28.069
-[Black Cindy] Fuck that.
-[whispering] Yeah!

34:28.735 --> 34:30.696
I don't do food service.

34:31.989 --> 34:34.658
Unless it's White Castle, you know,
'cause their burgers be so itty-bitty.

34:34.742 --> 34:36.409
So, you gonna go?

34:36.494 --> 34:38.411
I don't know.
I hate celebrities.

34:38.496 --> 34:41.248
They're all hoity-toity.
They have people watchin' 'em.

34:41.331 --> 34:42.875
They got all those adopted kids,

34:42.958 --> 34:45.002
-in general.
-[scoffs]

34:45.085 --> 34:47.463
I did once get to see
the real Lassie

34:47.545 --> 34:49.797
at the Dutchess County Sheep
and Wool Festival.

34:49.882 --> 34:52.050
-Like, the dog?
-Yeah.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.012
All right, inmates, forks down!

34:55.096 --> 34:57.054
First breakfast shift is now over.

34:57.139 --> 34:59.183
I need you to clear out,
so we can start the second shift.

34:59.267 --> 35:01.894
-[inmates groaning]
-Uh, but we didn't even get our food yet.

35:01.977 --> 35:04.021
Yeah, when I get too skinny,
my ass gets flat.

35:04.105 --> 35:07.108
Them's the rules.
You wanna eat, get here earlier next time.

35:07.191 --> 35:08.901
-[scoffs]
-[all exclaiming]

35:10.444 --> 35:11.862
[inmates clamoring]

35:11.945 --> 35:14.240
[Dixon] Did you hear me?
Let's move!

35:14.323 --> 35:16.909
'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!
'Scuse me!

35:16.992 --> 35:18.452
-'Scuse me!
-All right. All right.

35:21.205 --> 35:23.249
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

35:25.168 --> 35:28.837
Hey, rub-a-dub-dub, you've been scrubbin'
that same pan for 20 minutes.

35:28.921 --> 35:31.674
So what?
You a scrub expert now?

35:32.841 --> 35:34.843
You know what? Have at it.

35:35.761 --> 35:38.431
This got anything to do
with that meeting you had yesterday?

35:39.515 --> 35:40.849
Yeah, that's right.
I know about it.

35:40.933 --> 35:43.811
I'm like Columbo,
but with two real eyes and a better ass.

35:46.772 --> 35:48.149
I'm being evicted.

35:48.732 --> 35:50.151
You getting out?

35:50.234 --> 35:52.570
Not, like, this afternoon,
but yeah, real soon.

35:53.487 --> 35:55.656
How did you not know
your date was coming up?

35:55.739 --> 35:57.158
It's early.

35:57.241 --> 35:59.368
I guess I was good or some shit.
I don't know.

35:59.452 --> 36:01.329
[whispering] Holy shit.

36:02.371 --> 36:03.706
Wow.

36:04.957 --> 36:09.378
-Well, hey, congratulations.
-Yeah, no, not congratulations.

36:09.462 --> 36:12.089
More like con-fuck-ulations...

36:12.173 --> 36:14.842
or whatever the opposite
of congratulations is.

36:14.925 --> 36:16.635
Why? You get to go find your kids.

36:16.719 --> 36:19.763
You get to fuck 'em up yourself
instead of having someone do it for you.

36:19.847 --> 36:22.015
Even I find them,
I'm not gonna get 'em.

36:22.099 --> 36:24.685
The state won't give them over
unless I got an apartment.

36:24.768 --> 36:26.729
So you work a little bit,
you get an apartment.

36:26.812 --> 36:30.065
Sure. People love to hire ex-cons.

36:30.148 --> 36:33.319
And in skills, I'll write,
"Packed heroin real good,"

36:33.402 --> 36:36.239
and "Fucked people who pack heroin."

36:36.322 --> 36:37.531
[sighs]

36:38.699 --> 36:41.869
Why even try? I'm fucked.

36:41.952 --> 36:44.079
Ay, okay. Enough.

36:44.162 --> 36:46.582
You gotta bust your ass now, mama.

36:46.665 --> 36:49.752
Make some moves.
Work your contacts.

36:49.835 --> 36:51.920
Work your relatives.
Work the system.

36:52.004 --> 36:53.547
Get educated, if you have to.

36:53.631 --> 36:56.925
Get your GED.
Do whatever you gotta do.

36:57.009 --> 36:59.177
You got a goal now.

36:59.262 --> 37:01.555
You can't shrivel up into a ball.

37:01.639 --> 37:04.099
<i>Mira,</i> you gotta save your kids.

37:05.434 --> 37:06.477
You're Puerto Rican.

37:06.560 --> 37:09.230
You know somebody with an apartment.
You know somebody with a job.

37:09.313 --> 37:10.314
<i>Qué?</i>

37:11.148 --> 37:15.444
You gonna roll over like a <i>pendeja?</i> Huh?

37:16.862 --> 37:19.197
-No!
-No, that's right.

37:20.032 --> 37:24.245
<i>Mira,</i> clean that fucking pan,
'cause I got a life, too, you know?

37:24.328 --> 37:25.454
[chuckles]

37:28.416 --> 37:29.583
You told Daya yet?

37:29.667 --> 37:31.335
[sighs] No.

37:31.419 --> 37:33.546
Con-fuck-ulations on that one.

37:33.629 --> 37:34.880
No shit.

37:36.173 --> 37:38.175
[inmates talking indistinctly]

37:39.968 --> 37:41.554
[guard] You, get off the fence.

37:42.471 --> 37:44.222
I feel you creepin' over there.

37:51.564 --> 37:54.149
For the record, I'm a pacifist.

37:55.401 --> 37:57.361
-Huh?
-[both grunting]

37:59.905 --> 38:02.240
Lookie here.
A secret fuck spot.

38:02.325 --> 38:04.368
-Well, not anymore.
-[both grunting]

38:04.452 --> 38:08.205
Break it up. Come on.
Let's go. Keep movin'.

38:09.582 --> 38:11.334
[indistinct talking]

38:14.962 --> 38:18.924
Man, when you see them all together
like this, there are a lot of inmates.

38:19.007 --> 38:21.677
I know.
Like, if they ever banded together,

38:21.760 --> 38:24.638
they could totally overpower us.
[softly] We're done.

38:24.722 --> 38:27.475
At least we got the new guards.
They're, like, trained in combat.

38:27.558 --> 38:31.395
Yeah... but I'm kind of scared
of the new guards.

38:32.104 --> 38:34.315
-Yeah, me too.
-[chuckles lightly]

38:46.159 --> 38:48.787
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

38:50.914 --> 38:53.667
Hey, you think they'll give us leftovers?

38:53.751 --> 38:55.210
I don't know. Maybe.

38:56.337 --> 39:00.341
Ladies... I'd like to welcome you
to Food for Thought.

39:01.342 --> 39:03.844
This is an exclusive opportunity.

39:03.927 --> 39:06.514
People at Yale University
couldn't take this class...

39:06.597 --> 39:08.223
-[inmates laughing]
-...only you.

39:08.306 --> 39:09.350
Judy King!

39:09.433 --> 39:11.018
-Yes.
-[all laughing]

39:11.101 --> 39:15.105
So I'm gonna turn it over to,
uh, inmate King now.

39:18.859 --> 39:20.694
Uh, all right, how about this?

39:21.695 --> 39:25.574
I want you to raise your hand
if you've ever made sunchoke velouté.

39:26.450 --> 39:27.451
Never heard of it.

39:27.535 --> 39:31.163
-[Judy] How about cuttlefish ravioli?
-[panting]

39:31.246 --> 39:32.289
Never mind.

39:32.373 --> 39:34.500
What about anything with foam?

39:34.583 --> 39:36.251
"Foam," did she say?

39:36.334 --> 39:39.254
Good. Neither have I.

39:39.337 --> 39:40.756
-[inmates exclaiming]
-[Judy] All right.

39:40.839 --> 39:42.257
I don't make anything highfalutin.

39:42.340 --> 39:47.137
I cook real food for real people to eat,
and I don't do it alone.

39:47.220 --> 39:51.559
I mean, any good chef will tell you
that cookin' is a team sport.

39:51.642 --> 39:53.894
So you're gonna learn
some practical skills here

39:53.977 --> 39:56.980
that are gonna make you
a better team player.

39:57.064 --> 40:00.275
So, today, I'm gonna do a demonstration,
but I'm hopin' that,

40:00.358 --> 40:03.195
in the future,
we're gonna set up some work stations

40:03.278 --> 40:05.489
so everybody can get their hands dirty.

40:05.573 --> 40:07.533
-[inmates exclaim]
-Yes, with the makeup.

40:07.616 --> 40:09.076
Uh, Muccio.

40:09.159 --> 40:12.120
Uh, I was just wonderin',
do you think we'll do a casserole?

40:12.204 --> 40:14.039
Because I know that my Vinnie,

40:14.122 --> 40:17.125
he really likes
the traditional-type stuff.

40:17.209 --> 40:19.377
Well, no, darlin', we're not.

40:19.462 --> 40:20.921
We're gonna have to do
somethin' much simpler,

40:21.004 --> 40:25.468
since we don't have very much
in the way of ingredients or knives,

40:25.551 --> 40:30.431
but it's a dish that I think
some of you, in particular,

40:30.514 --> 40:32.182
are really gonna enjoy.

40:32.265 --> 40:33.476
Cornbread!

40:33.559 --> 40:35.436
-Yup. See? You called it. Racist.
-[scoffs]

40:35.519 --> 40:37.730
But Filipino style.

40:37.813 --> 40:39.857
-Yeah, I'm not sure about that.
-[Black Cindy] Mmm.

40:39.940 --> 40:44.027
I got this recipe
from a coconut farmer in Manila.

40:44.111 --> 40:45.863
Now, I need a volunteer.

40:45.946 --> 40:49.116
-[inmate] Me! How about me?
-Oh, yes, Ms. Washington. Come on.

40:49.199 --> 40:52.453
-[grunts]
-Teacher's pet, man.

40:54.747 --> 40:56.665
Now, I'm gonna need your help.

40:56.749 --> 40:58.333
-Oh, look, I meant to-- Look at that.
-[giggles]

40:58.416 --> 41:01.629
-What on earth does that say, I wonder?
<i>-Lait de coco.</i>

41:01.712 --> 41:03.797
-That's it, I knew you'd know it.
-It's coconut milk.

41:03.881 --> 41:06.550
Now, the first step is easy.

41:07.551 --> 41:11.013
-Locate a shit-ton of butter.
-[inmates murmuring]

41:11.096 --> 41:12.139
All right?

41:15.518 --> 41:20.898
So, after that, I got my master's degree
in social work from Iona.

41:24.234 --> 41:26.236
Hey, you're not hungry?

41:26.319 --> 41:27.821
No. [chuckles]

41:28.989 --> 41:30.658
No, my teeth...

41:30.741 --> 41:32.325
Oh, we'll get you something softer.

41:32.409 --> 41:36.622
We'll get you some, uh, cottage cheese
or deviled eggs or something like that.

41:36.705 --> 41:38.624
-Sam...
-Yeah.

41:40.458 --> 41:41.502
It's me.

41:43.378 --> 41:45.047
It's your boy.

41:46.549 --> 41:47.841
I've missed you, Mom.

41:48.759 --> 41:49.927
[whimpers]

41:51.136 --> 41:55.098
Mom, I want you to know
I'm not angry with you for disappearing.

41:56.224 --> 42:00.646
I know that you reached out to me
that night... and I didn't listen.

42:01.855 --> 42:03.607
I wasn't there for you.

42:05.025 --> 42:08.111
But I'm...
I'm hopin' to change all that now.

42:09.780 --> 42:11.364
Okay?

42:13.200 --> 42:16.870
What? Is that your... name?

42:17.955 --> 42:19.623
[stuttering] Ellen?

42:21.333 --> 42:23.877
Ellen. Ellen.

42:25.087 --> 42:26.714
Yes, I'm Ellen.

42:27.590 --> 42:29.091
Not Margaret?

42:30.133 --> 42:33.637
No... I'm Ellen.

42:39.351 --> 42:41.519
Okay, well...
you know what?

42:41.604 --> 42:45.023
We'll... We'll have a nice meal together.

42:45.107 --> 42:46.734
I'm not gonna send it back.

42:47.610 --> 42:50.738
No, I gotta go.

42:50.821 --> 42:52.239
I gotta go find my blanket.

42:52.322 --> 42:53.991
No, no. Stay.

42:54.074 --> 42:57.035
[chuckles] Stay and talk to me.
Uh, I'm havin' a bad night.

42:57.119 --> 43:00.080
From the looks of it,
you're not in such a great place yourself.

43:00.163 --> 43:01.915
No, I gotta go now!

43:01.999 --> 43:03.333
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

43:03.416 --> 43:06.419
You think somebody else
is gonna help you now? Huh?

43:06.503 --> 43:07.713
-[Ellen whimpers]
-Huh?

43:15.053 --> 43:16.764
Doggett. Hey.

43:16.847 --> 43:18.306
Will you wait up?

43:20.726 --> 43:22.269
You avoiding me or somethin'?

43:22.352 --> 43:25.731
I just don't really like cookin'.
I was just curious, but I changed my mind.

43:25.814 --> 43:28.525
Not just now, but, like,
all the time.

43:28.609 --> 43:31.486
No. Just been busy workin' really hard.

43:33.989 --> 43:36.491
Hey, you can talk to me.

43:37.618 --> 43:40.203
What's goin' on? You got one of those
seizures comin' or somethin'?

43:47.002 --> 43:49.838
-Are you doin' it with her?
-What?

43:51.757 --> 43:56.011
Are you doin' it with that Spanish girl,
that lil' pixie one that drives the van?

43:56.094 --> 43:58.471
What are you talkin' about? Ramos?

43:59.514 --> 44:01.308
She's not even my type.

44:02.392 --> 44:03.977
-Why? You jealous?
-No.

44:05.353 --> 44:07.397
No, I'm not jealous.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.692
-Why would you even ask me that?
-'Cause...

44:16.114 --> 44:18.826
I just wanna make sure
you're not rapin' her, is all.

44:34.132 --> 44:37.761
You think... I raped you?

44:46.519 --> 44:49.314
Yeah. I mean,
what else do you call that?

44:52.985 --> 44:55.320
But I love you.
I told you that.

44:57.155 --> 44:59.491
And I said it when... When...

45:01.451 --> 45:03.078
I said it.

45:03.161 --> 45:04.162
So?

45:05.122 --> 45:07.124
So, that makes it different.

45:15.799 --> 45:18.051
But that didn't feel any different.

45:35.693 --> 45:37.404
I've called this summit...

45:37.487 --> 45:41.283
because all three of you
need to communicate better.

45:41.366 --> 45:43.201
You're operating out of fear,

45:43.285 --> 45:47.080
which is causing certain people
to make bad decisions.

45:48.165 --> 45:50.708
Oh, well, uh--
I'm sorry. Who are you?

45:50.793 --> 45:54.296
-You know who I am!
-No, I mean, who sent you?

45:54.379 --> 45:57.215
Relax. I asked her for help.
She's here as a consultant.

45:57.299 --> 45:59.176
And how do you know she is not bugged?

45:59.259 --> 46:01.636
She could be recordin' this whole thing.

46:01.719 --> 46:04.264
She is Russian, for God's sake.

46:04.347 --> 46:08.518
Lolly... how can you assure
your partners over here...

46:09.561 --> 46:13.690
that you are not going to go digging
for buried treasure again?

46:14.774 --> 46:17.735
'Cause I don't have a shovel.

46:17.820 --> 46:19.362
Good point.

46:19.446 --> 46:22.240
Maybe we should strategize
how to get her kicked off grounds' crew.

46:22.324 --> 46:25.452
All right, could we just move on
and just put this in the past?

46:25.535 --> 46:27.287
I can.

46:27.370 --> 46:30.290
Then again...
I'm not our problem.

46:32.876 --> 46:34.377
Oh... [stutters]

46:34.461 --> 46:36.171
Why is everybody lookin' at me?

46:36.254 --> 46:38.966
Because your little <i>Tell-Tale Heart</i> stunt
freaked everybody out.

46:39.049 --> 46:40.258
And now nobody here trusts you.

46:40.342 --> 46:42.970
Fine. I got two words for you guys.

46:43.053 --> 46:44.387
Las Vegas.

46:44.471 --> 46:48.934
-Oh, here we go.
-There is a bunker in Las Vegas

46:49.017 --> 46:52.270
filled with these dudes who work
for the United States government,

46:52.354 --> 46:56.942
and they sit on these little
video-game consoles and they... they...

46:57.025 --> 47:00.653
they fly drones over Afghanistan and Iraq.

47:00.737 --> 47:02.155
You know that--
Okay, you know the drone

47:02.239 --> 47:04.241
that's been hoverin' over
the... the garden?

47:04.324 --> 47:07.160
That is just a camera drone,

47:07.244 --> 47:09.371
but if you listen really good,

47:09.454 --> 47:13.125
you could hear the second drone
above that drone.

47:13.208 --> 47:16.128
That is the Predator drone,
and that is the drone that kills people!

47:16.211 --> 47:18.755
-From Las Vegas.
-Exactly!

47:19.589 --> 47:22.675
-See? She gets it.
-Barely.

47:22.759 --> 47:26.263
I have it under very good information

47:26.346 --> 47:30.142
that that killer drone was sent
by the United States government

47:30.225 --> 47:34.146
in response to our attack
on one of their agents.

47:34.229 --> 47:38.608
And since the Freedom of Information Act
does not apply to privatized prisons...

47:39.859 --> 47:41.569
they could just wipe us out!

47:41.653 --> 47:44.281
Boom, boom, boom,
and nobody would ever even know.

47:44.364 --> 47:48.201
But... [clicks tongue] see,
unless we shoot that drone down...

47:49.577 --> 47:52.539
I guess we'd have to use a gun
or somethin' like that and...

47:52.622 --> 47:54.624
we'd have to probably steal it
from a guard.

47:54.707 --> 47:58.878
Or we sneak on to a computer
and just leak the information

47:58.962 --> 48:02.966
to that dude, um, Julian Assage.
Assange...

48:03.967 --> 48:05.385
if I could still find his e-mail.

48:05.468 --> 48:09.097
All right, you guys keep talkin',

48:09.181 --> 48:12.850
and I'm gonna go out to the garden
and check on that drone.

48:22.027 --> 48:24.904
Frieda's right.
We have to kill her.

48:27.199 --> 48:30.077
[woman on PA]
<i>Group therapy is starting in five minutes.</i>

48:34.039 --> 48:35.873
Missed quite a show.

48:35.958 --> 48:38.376
-Good.
-Big success.

48:38.460 --> 48:39.711
Good.

48:39.794 --> 48:44.132
Listen, uh, Ms. King has asked me
to remove you as her counselor.

48:44.216 --> 48:46.843
[chuckling] What?
That's ridiculous.

48:46.926 --> 48:48.511
She says you make her uncomfortable...

48:49.429 --> 48:51.139
and that you have power issues.

48:54.351 --> 48:57.145
[stuttering] That's how women talk.

48:57.229 --> 49:00.523
Well... MCC is
already up my ass about her.

49:01.441 --> 49:02.775
I gotta comply.

49:05.320 --> 49:08.031
She's an inmate,
for Christ's sakes, Joe.

49:08.115 --> 49:09.574
Yeah, for now.

49:09.657 --> 49:13.495
But in half a year...
she'll be a rich celebrity again

49:13.578 --> 49:17.040
with the power and means to sue us
for whatever the fuck she wants.

49:18.250 --> 49:20.960
[stutters] What about Food for Thought?

49:21.711 --> 49:24.047
Someone else will supervise the class.

49:25.048 --> 49:28.468
Hey... on the bright side,

49:28.551 --> 49:31.846
this class had the highest attendance
out of any activity to date.

49:32.805 --> 49:35.558
It was a hit.
You were right. Good job.

49:51.533 --> 49:54.161
Why you hiding in here?
It's creepy.

49:56.079 --> 49:57.914
It's quiet. I like it.

50:04.046 --> 50:05.297
That's nice.

50:07.715 --> 50:10.093
If I spend time... [sighs]

50:10.177 --> 50:12.679
reading law books
or reading up on foster care,

50:12.762 --> 50:17.642
maybe, instead of drawing these
stupid pictures, I'd be prepared.

50:17.725 --> 50:19.644
I'd maybe know how to get Armaria back.

50:19.727 --> 50:21.771
[both sigh]

50:21.854 --> 50:23.315
Daya, look at me.

50:25.650 --> 50:27.277
I'm getting out of here soon.

50:30.822 --> 50:32.782
Soon? How soon?

50:32.865 --> 50:34.117
Real soon.

50:34.201 --> 50:38.330
And I'm gonna get Christina and Eva
and Lucy and Emiliano

50:38.413 --> 50:40.623
and your little Armaria back.

50:41.666 --> 50:44.169
So stop all this moping shit.

50:46.296 --> 50:47.380
Are you kidding me?

50:48.131 --> 50:49.549
Why would I mess with you like that?

50:49.632 --> 50:50.842
[scoffs]

50:50.925 --> 50:53.761
I don't know, 'cause you play
some fucked-up head games sometimes?

50:53.845 --> 50:55.138
[sighs]

50:59.058 --> 51:00.935
Why ain't you saying nothing?

51:02.187 --> 51:03.605
[sighs]

51:09.819 --> 51:11.404
I'm gonna miss you.

51:14.073 --> 51:17.494
-And you're probably gonna fuck up my kid.
-[chuckles]

51:18.995 --> 51:20.580
[inmates talking indistinctly]

51:21.581 --> 51:25.084
[chuckles] So, um...
yeah, we quit.

51:25.168 --> 51:27.295
-Sorry.
-[chuckling] But, like, not really.

51:27.379 --> 51:28.963
[Maritza chuckles lightly]

51:29.046 --> 51:30.798
Let me guess.
You're working for Maria now.

51:30.882 --> 51:32.550
She gave us free slipper socks.

51:34.969 --> 51:37.096
She is paying you in slipper socks

51:37.180 --> 51:40.099
'cause she can't pay you
in actual money yet.

51:40.183 --> 51:42.894
-Flaca, what about your sick mother?
-[scoffs]

51:42.977 --> 51:44.812
Don't you wanna send her cash?

51:44.896 --> 51:47.857
Don't you go pretendin' like
you actually care about me.

51:47.940 --> 51:50.943
Soon, I'll be making twice
as much cash with Maria,

51:51.027 --> 51:55.031
'cause she's all about, like,
upward mobility and <i>la raza.</i>

51:55.114 --> 51:57.950
And you know what?
She's just plain nicer.

51:58.034 --> 52:00.162
-And slipper socks.
-You said that already.

52:00.245 --> 52:01.288
I really like them.

52:07.794 --> 52:10.380
Should I go over there
and pull her hair or something?

52:10.463 --> 52:13.466
-I give a mean Indian burn.
-No, I got this.

52:17.845 --> 52:19.472
You're jacking my girls now?

52:19.556 --> 52:21.266
You jacked my panties,
I jack your girls.

52:21.349 --> 52:22.850
You jacked my idea.

52:22.934 --> 52:24.602
-[scoffs]
-You are the original jacker.

52:24.686 --> 52:27.772
Look, Maria...
this is getting out of hand.

52:27.855 --> 52:28.856
[chuckles]

52:28.940 --> 52:30.525
I do not wanna start a war with you.

52:30.608 --> 52:33.528
This isn't war. It's business.

52:34.612 --> 52:36.448
Have a nice day.

52:38.157 --> 52:42.454
Hey! Hey! How you gonna identify me
without this?

52:42.537 --> 52:45.248
Hmm? How you gonna do it?
How you gonna kill me then?

52:45.332 --> 52:47.875
You're not gonna do it.
You're not gonna do it.

52:47.959 --> 52:49.168
-[guards laughing]
-How do you think you're gonna

52:49.252 --> 52:52.839
identify me without this? Hmm?
How you gonna do it?

52:52.922 --> 52:54.341
The fuck's happening here?

52:54.424 --> 52:58.010
I, um, I don't know.
But it is highly entertaining.

52:58.094 --> 52:59.136
[Lolly] Homemade camouflage, bitches!

52:59.221 --> 53:00.722
[Piscatella] How long has she been
like this?

53:00.805 --> 53:02.056
-[Dixon] Ten, fifteen minutes.
-[grunting]

53:02.139 --> 53:05.435
Yeah. She was yelling about the NSA,
um, and body parts. [laughs]

53:05.518 --> 53:07.562
The prisoner is having a psychotic break

53:07.645 --> 53:10.273
and you're standing here
giggling like women.

53:10.357 --> 53:11.608
Let's get her to Psych. Now.

53:11.691 --> 53:12.775
You stay here.

53:12.859 --> 53:16.070
[Lolly] You can't see me!
You can't shoot me! I'm invisible!

53:16.153 --> 53:18.030
-I'm invisible!
-Lolly! Lolly, get up!

53:18.114 --> 53:20.867
-No! Don't shoot me!
-Lolly, please get up.

53:20.950 --> 53:24.496
Can't see me, can't see me,
can't see me, can't see me.

53:24.579 --> 53:25.580
On your feet.

53:29.709 --> 53:31.002
[glass shattering]

53:44.140 --> 53:46.559
[inmate 1 shouting] Rose, you smell that?

53:47.810 --> 53:49.145
[inmate 2] What is that?

53:49.228 --> 53:51.523
[inmate 3] Smoke, girl! Guards!

53:51.606 --> 53:54.484
Sound the alarm!
Get out of here!

53:55.192 --> 53:56.193
[alarm ringing]

53:56.278 --> 53:58.613
Get everybody out! Come on! Now!
Let's go! Let's go!

53:58.696 --> 53:59.697
-[alarm continues]
-[panicked yelling]

54:03.034 --> 54:07.497
Tell Caputo to go fuck himself.
I'm just gettin' started.

54:09.040 --> 54:10.542
Jesus Christ.

54:15.880 --> 54:19.634
[screaming] No! No!
They're gonna electrocute me!

54:19.717 --> 54:21.303
Hey, what the hell's goin' on here?

54:21.386 --> 54:23.220
We got a live one.
Takin' her to Psych.

54:23.305 --> 54:26.265
This woman needs a certified counselor.

54:26.349 --> 54:27.559
Come here.

54:29.018 --> 54:30.269
-Come on.
-[panting]

54:31.187 --> 54:34.857
Come. We'll have a talk in my office.
Okay?

54:36.275 --> 54:37.276
[sighs]

54:37.360 --> 54:38.611
Show's over.

54:42.407 --> 54:44.409
People are trying to kill me.

54:45.327 --> 54:46.494
Who?

54:46.578 --> 54:49.581
[sniffles] The NSA, the military,

54:49.664 --> 54:52.500
whoever's operating...
[stutters] that drone

54:52.584 --> 54:54.919
that's hidin' in the clouds
above the garden.

54:55.002 --> 54:59.048
Why is the NSA or the military
interested in our garden?

55:00.091 --> 55:01.884
'Cause I... [stutters]

55:01.968 --> 55:03.177
[sighs]

55:06.138 --> 55:10.101
I killed a guy and chopped him up
and buried him in there. [sighs]

55:12.895 --> 55:14.897
-You killed a guy?
-Yep.

55:15.857 --> 55:17.734
He was a hit man.

55:19.026 --> 55:22.321
He worked for an international drug cartel
that was backed by the United States,

55:22.405 --> 55:23.615
probably the CIA.

55:23.698 --> 55:26.158
[gasps] Oh, it could've been FEMA.

55:27.452 --> 55:29.746
They've been targeting me for a long time.

55:30.705 --> 55:32.790
Have you ever heard of,
uh, of Rex 84?

55:33.708 --> 55:36.252
No, of course you haven't heard of it.
It's classified.

55:37.837 --> 55:41.883
Do you sometimes see
or hear things that aren't there?

55:43.385 --> 55:45.261
Sure, I hear voices.

55:45.344 --> 55:46.763
Like angels?
That sorta thing?

55:46.846 --> 55:49.516
Not angels. I told you.
Voices, I hear voices.

55:52.935 --> 55:55.980
I think you might be
suffering from delusions.

55:57.732 --> 55:58.983
I am not.

56:01.277 --> 56:03.362
I hear that all the time.

56:03.446 --> 56:05.281
"Lolly, you're crazy."

56:06.991 --> 56:11.663
"Lolly, you got conspiracy-theory-itis."
That is not it!

56:11.746 --> 56:13.748
This is different this time.
This is real.

56:14.582 --> 56:18.085
What if these voices that you're hearing
are manipulating you?

56:19.295 --> 56:21.423
Trying to convince you that they're real?

56:23.090 --> 56:26.844
That you did a bad thing,
when in reality, you didn't do anything?

56:28.971 --> 56:30.056
Why would they do that?

56:30.139 --> 56:31.683
You tell me.

56:34.393 --> 56:35.687
Um...

56:35.770 --> 56:38.272
[gasps] Ooh, to frame me.

56:39.732 --> 56:43.570
Ooh, to, um... [clicking tongue]
They could do research on me.

56:44.654 --> 56:48.282
As a counselor...
I know everything that goes on here.

56:48.365 --> 56:49.576
[sniffles]

56:49.659 --> 56:51.453
So, if someone...

56:52.912 --> 56:54.205
anyone...

56:55.540 --> 56:57.917
was killed here on campus...

56:59.376 --> 57:00.670
I'd know about it.

57:02.296 --> 57:05.550
[sniffles] So, you're saying
I didn't kill anybody?

57:05.633 --> 57:09.095
No... I don't believe you did.

57:09.178 --> 57:10.847
[sniffles]

57:14.809 --> 57:17.562
Lucky for you, I got a lot of experience
dealing with this kinda thing.

57:19.522 --> 57:22.108
Let's get a treatment plan
goin' for you, Whitehill.

57:23.109 --> 57:25.820
Get those voices of yours under control.

57:27.822 --> 57:29.574
You don't have to worry.

57:30.575 --> 57:31.868
I'm gonna help you.

57:35.580 --> 57:37.164
What the fuck did you say in there?

57:37.248 --> 57:39.751
Okay, okay, okay, wait.
Hold up. Hold up.

57:39.834 --> 57:41.085
I gotta apologize.

57:41.168 --> 57:44.547
See, I was under the impression that I...

57:44.631 --> 57:46.716
we, killed some dude.

57:46.799 --> 57:49.051
No, my bad.
My bad. My bad.

57:49.135 --> 57:52.722
Turns out Rex 84 was manipulating my brain

57:52.805 --> 57:54.431
to make me think that.

57:55.475 --> 57:59.812
Or maybe that Aydin guy was really,
like, a hologram?

58:01.481 --> 58:03.858
Also, great counseling here.

58:03.941 --> 58:06.402
I am continually impressed.

58:10.406 --> 58:11.741
[chuckles]

58:11.824 --> 58:14.201
