WEBVTT

00:02.599 --> 00:04.599
You and I are officially together.

00:04.600 --> 00:05.692
What are you talking about?

00:05.692 --> 00:06.976
The sex tape.

00:07.043 --> 00:08.677
I don't look as bad as if
I made it with my boyfriend.

00:08.745 --> 00:10.262
I'm being deported.

00:10.313 --> 00:12.131
Marrying me fixes everything.

00:12.199 --> 00:13.782
I can't marry you.

00:13.867 --> 00:16.235
Remember the tennis player that
wouldn't take no for an answer?

00:16.286 --> 00:17.386
That Katie girl?

00:17.454 --> 00:18.954
Why do you have a photo with her?

00:19.039 --> 00:19.805
Because it's not her.

00:19.873 --> 00:21.006
It's Sara.

00:21.074 --> 00:22.508
You'll never be Sara.

00:22.576 --> 00:23.826
Neither will you.

00:23.910 --> 00:25.327
We'll see about that.

00:25.412 --> 00:28.230
Her behavior gets a little unpredictable.

00:28.298 --> 00:29.431
How unpredictable?

00:29.499 --> 00:31.250
Let's just say you should be careful.

00:32.469 --> 00:33.669
Oh, cool!

00:33.737 --> 00:35.287
- Jamie!
- I didn't mean to!

00:35.372 --> 00:37.223
Look what you did! Go to your room!

00:37.290 --> 00:39.325
Even though she doesn't
show it all the time,

00:39.392 --> 00:43.596
deep down inside, your mom is still
very sad that your grandma died.

00:43.595 --> 00:45.116
Mom's gonna be okay, right?

00:53.024 --> 00:58.544
Someone once said that death is
not the greatest loss in life.

00:58.612 --> 01:02.698
The greatest loss is what dies
inside of us while we live.

01:02.783 --> 01:07.953
I could tell you who said it,
but who the hell really cares?

01:15.100 --> 01:15.616
Mama?

01:16.728 --> 01:17.761
Mama?

01:17.812 --> 01:19.296
Mama?

01:19.347 --> 01:22.750
I made my own breakfast
and cleaned everything up.

01:24.302 --> 01:27.187
What do you want, a gold star?

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:11.445 --> 03:14.337
I mean, obviously, the
closing title song goes here,

03:14.337 --> 03:18.248
and the credits, and
it's all temp track sound,

03:18.299 --> 03:19.883
but...

03:19.951 --> 03:21.087
Is it okay?

03:21.087 --> 03:22.671
It's so good.

03:22.739 --> 03:25.173
I loved the scenes
with them on the balcony

03:25.241 --> 03:29.177
and the way he looked at
her when she slept and...

03:29.228 --> 03:30.696
It's really good!

03:30.763 --> 03:34.466
Alex and Josh actually
have amazing chemistry.

03:34.534 --> 03:36.985
Seriously, with the douchey
puka shells and the sunglasses?

03:37.053 --> 03:40.272
Seriously, with the annoying voice and
the worse than annoying rest of you?

03:40.356 --> 03:42.524
Well, our next guests are
not only starring together

03:42.575 --> 03:44.893
in a new independent
film, they're also starring

03:44.944 --> 03:47.813
together online as you may have heard...

03:47.880 --> 03:51.717
I can't believe I have to pretend
to be with you... you... you...

03:51.784 --> 03:53.001
You hear that?

03:53.069 --> 03:55.470
That's the echo coming from your crotch.

03:55.538 --> 03:58.090
Oh, great. Add a nice batch
of ass breath to the mix.

03:58.174 --> 04:00.926
Please welcome actors
and real-life lovebirds,

04:01.010 --> 04:03.295
Josh Avery and Alex DuprÃ©.

04:04.914 --> 04:05.864
Dick.

04:05.932 --> 04:06.765
Whore.

04:09.319 --> 04:10.469
Just a little ass breath for my baby.

04:16.358 --> 04:18.427
It all just seems so fake...

04:18.494 --> 04:22.514
this idea that good things
happen to good people

04:22.582 --> 04:24.800
and there's magic in the world

04:24.867 --> 04:27.936
and the meek and the
righteous will inherit it.

04:27.987 --> 04:30.322
There's too many good people who suffer

04:30.390 --> 04:31.773
for something like that to be true.

04:31.824 --> 04:35.110
There are too many prayers
that get unanswered.

04:37.046 --> 04:41.883
Every day we ignore how
completely broken this world is,

04:41.968 --> 04:45.087
and we tell ourselves
it's all gonna be okay.

04:45.138 --> 04:46.988
"You're gonna be okay."

04:48.725 --> 04:51.292
But it's not okay.

04:52.762 --> 04:54.546
And once you know that...

04:57.133 --> 04:59.017
there's no going back.

05:00.737 --> 05:03.304
There's no magic in the world.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.775
Least, not today there isn't.

05:32.151 --> 05:33.768
You've only been going two weeks,

05:33.853 --> 05:35.437
and you're already skipping sessions?

05:38.007 --> 05:40.992
I don't blame you. It's a nice day.

05:41.060 --> 05:43.862
Who'd want to waste an hour
in a therapist's office?

05:43.913 --> 05:46.114
It's 50 minutes, actually.

05:46.199 --> 05:48.416
Somehow their hour
works out to 50 minutes.

05:48.501 --> 05:52.287
If I told you that a half-hour was
20 minutes, you'd call me crazy.

05:52.371 --> 05:53.889
We're all crazy, Hales.

05:53.956 --> 05:56.758
Some of us just hide
it better than others.

05:56.826 --> 06:00.212
How'd you like to spend
the day, just you and me?

06:00.279 --> 06:01.796
Quinn's watching Jamie.

06:01.881 --> 06:03.315
Let's go for a drive.

06:03.382 --> 06:05.183
Whatever.

06:05.251 --> 06:07.435
You say the sweetest
things to me, Haley James.

06:11.991 --> 06:15.076
There's my man!

06:15.144 --> 06:17.095
Hi, Aunt Quinn.

06:17.146 --> 06:18.513
Oh, come on, now.

06:18.581 --> 06:22.033
Don't make me find a cake and
stuff your face in it again.

06:22.101 --> 06:23.818
I'm just worried about mom.

06:23.903 --> 06:26.071
I know.

06:26.138 --> 06:27.822
But, hey, she's gonna be okay.

06:27.890 --> 06:29.274
I promise.

06:29.325 --> 06:31.409
I hope so.

06:31.477 --> 06:33.962
I miss her... the way she used to be.

06:34.030 --> 06:36.998
Me too.

06:41.387 --> 06:43.405
What's that movie?

06:43.472 --> 06:45.056
"The Goonies"!

06:45.124 --> 06:46.458
Ever seen it?

06:46.525 --> 06:47.976
- No.
- What?!

06:48.060 --> 06:51.462
This was like my favorite
movie when I was your age.

06:51.514 --> 06:53.548
You, uh, you want to watch it with me?

06:53.616 --> 06:55.050
Sure. Can Chester watch, too?

06:55.117 --> 06:56.151
Yeah!

06:56.235 --> 06:57.969
It's totally bunny approved.

06:58.037 --> 06:59.020
Come on.

07:03.281 --> 07:04.109
You ready?

07:04.109 --> 07:06.100
Yeah.

07:09.334 --> 07:12.084
Maybe the movie sucks.

07:12.084 --> 07:13.952
- Julian...
- No, I'm serious.

07:14.003 --> 07:16.204
Why did I ever get involved with
film-making in the first place?

07:16.289 --> 07:17.989
Because you watched "The Thin Red Line"

07:18.040 --> 07:19.541
with your father when you were a boy,

07:19.625 --> 07:22.043
and it was the best day you ever had.

07:22.128 --> 07:23.795
You don't know me, Brooke Davis.

07:23.846 --> 07:25.513
Oh, I think I do, Julian Baker.

07:25.631 --> 07:27.048
And you know what else I know?

07:27.133 --> 07:28.717
You'll get in.

07:28.801 --> 07:30.201
It's a big deal.

07:30.269 --> 07:32.420
The Wasatch Valley Film
Festival is a first look for...

07:32.488 --> 07:33.888
A first look for a ton
of prestigious films.

07:33.956 --> 07:34.856
I know.

07:34.941 --> 07:36.524
Today is the deadline.

07:36.609 --> 07:38.810
You gave them your cell,
my cell, and Paul's cell,

07:38.861 --> 07:41.146
and if you don't get in,
you're taking me to Cabo.

07:41.197 --> 07:43.398
Wait, when did I say the Cabo part?

07:43.482 --> 07:45.183
You didn't, I just did.

07:46.619 --> 07:48.370
I had to send them a rough cut.

07:48.437 --> 07:49.788
Maybe they hated it.

07:49.855 --> 07:53.425
Maybe they loved it, and they'll
tell you that when you get in.

07:53.492 --> 07:56.645
Maybe I love you, and
I'll love you forever.

07:59.832 --> 08:00.966
What's your day like?

08:01.033 --> 08:02.917
Well, I have to go to the store

08:03.002 --> 08:06.471
and deal with my mother and
Alexander and that madness.

08:07.266 --> 08:07.922
I have to fix the toe
that you are massacring.

08:11.978 --> 08:15.930
And then I'm gonna go
spend some time with Haley.

08:16.015 --> 08:17.115
Sorry.

08:17.183 --> 08:18.433
How's Haley doing?

08:18.501 --> 08:20.986
Not good.

08:21.053 --> 08:24.339
She's just sad and depressed and angry.

08:24.407 --> 08:26.558
Well, send her my best, okay?

08:26.625 --> 08:28.777
I will.

08:28.861 --> 08:31.780
And send Julian my best and
tell him I love him, okay?

08:31.864 --> 08:33.448
I will.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.335
It's a great film.

08:37.403 --> 08:39.070
They'll call.

08:39.121 --> 08:40.238
You'll get in.

08:46.012 --> 08:47.846
My first week in Tree Hill,

08:47.913 --> 08:50.682
I told Haley I was gonna close this place.

08:50.749 --> 08:52.917
Couldn't wait to get out of here.

08:52.968 --> 08:54.402
And now I'm gonna miss it.

08:54.470 --> 08:57.305
Why, after last night, you're
still not ready to marry me?

08:59.358 --> 09:01.443
Last night was amazing.

09:01.527 --> 09:02.811
Every night has been.

09:02.895 --> 09:04.429
But, no...

09:04.497 --> 09:05.880
I still can't marry you.

09:05.948 --> 09:09.901
I need you to promise me something.

09:09.969 --> 09:13.655
Promise me that when I'm gone,
you'll still finish the record.

09:13.723 --> 09:15.724
I will.

09:15.791 --> 09:17.275
For you.

09:17.326 --> 09:19.244
No. For you.

09:19.295 --> 09:20.345
For us.

09:21.997 --> 09:24.332
But we are not that far off.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.485
We might just finish this thing
by the time you have to leave.

09:27.553 --> 09:29.387
No. We won't.

09:31.424 --> 09:33.675
Because I leave tonight.

09:33.759 --> 09:35.627
What?

09:35.694 --> 09:37.095
Why didn't you tell me?

09:37.163 --> 09:38.629
Because last night was amazing.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.935
But now I have to go...

09:43.986 --> 09:45.303
tonight.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.589
Relationships suck.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.591
Okay, but I'm supposed to be the
one with relationship problems,

10:02.659 --> 10:03.976
and you are supposed to be

10:04.060 --> 10:06.011
the "sweet but kind of rough
around the edges" bartender

10:06.096 --> 10:07.396
who listens and offers sage advice.

10:07.463 --> 10:09.464
You don't have relationship problems.

10:09.516 --> 10:10.516
How would you know?

10:14.638 --> 10:15.771
Right.

10:15.822 --> 10:17.690
Now I definitely need a drink.

10:17.774 --> 10:19.358
Shot of Tequila.

10:19.442 --> 10:20.492
But you have to drink it.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.061
Perfect.

10:33.497 --> 10:34.343
Quinn?

10:34.991 --> 10:35.874
In here, honey.

10:38.728 --> 10:39.678
What are you doing here?

10:39.746 --> 10:42.231
What do you mean, baby?

10:42.299 --> 10:43.515
Don't call me that.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.090
All right, the song,
the grape Kool-Aid...

10:46.090 --> 10:48.559
how do you know about
that? How do you know?

10:48.559 --> 10:50.472
What do you mean, how do I know?

10:50.523 --> 10:52.858
Clay, it's me, honey. It's Sara.

10:52.926 --> 10:54.960
- Don't say that.
- Clay...

10:55.028 --> 10:56.395
Sara's dead.

10:56.463 --> 10:58.113
Don't you remember when
we first heard this song?

10:58.181 --> 11:01.116
We flew to Austin for
that weekend in October

11:01.184 --> 11:03.402
- and stayed in that little house.
- Stop it.

11:03.470 --> 11:04.653
The day we first met.

11:04.721 --> 11:06.071
I said I'd rather streak on the quad,

11:06.156 --> 11:07.823
and you said you picked the wrong school.

11:07.874 --> 11:10.125
I don't know how you know these things,

11:10.193 --> 11:13.045
but I do know that my wife is dead,

11:13.129 --> 11:14.797
and she's not coming back.

11:14.864 --> 11:16.498
And neither are you. All right?

11:16.549 --> 11:17.800
Do you understand me?

11:17.867 --> 11:19.852
Don't ever come back here. Out.

11:22.105 --> 11:24.006
I'm here, Clay.

11:24.057 --> 11:25.874
It's me.

11:25.925 --> 11:28.043
We could be together again.

11:28.094 --> 11:30.095
No. We can't be together.

11:30.180 --> 11:32.097
And we won't be together, ever.

11:32.165 --> 11:33.198
Now get out.

11:33.266 --> 11:35.934
Go. Out.

11:48.152 --> 11:50.570
That movie...

11:50.638 --> 11:51.451
was so awesome.

11:51.451 --> 11:52.522
I know.

11:52.522 --> 11:56.468
Wouldn't it be cool if there actually
was a secret treasure somewhere?

11:56.468 --> 11:59.587
Well, funny you should say that,

11:59.655 --> 12:02.273
because a long time ago I found this...

12:02.341 --> 12:04.342
But I've never been able to figure it out.

12:04.409 --> 12:05.760
Maybe you can help me.

12:07.379 --> 12:09.163
Let's see.

12:09.214 --> 12:11.549
"If the treasure you do seek,

12:11.633 --> 12:14.051
no one tell and no word speak.

12:14.119 --> 12:17.221
Commit no crime but go to court,

12:17.306 --> 12:20.308
not for law, instead for sport."

12:20.375 --> 12:22.193
What does it mean?

12:22.277 --> 12:23.477
I don't know.

12:23.529 --> 12:26.564
I mean, what kind of
court doesn't have lawyers?

12:28.400 --> 12:29.867
A courtyard?

12:29.952 --> 12:31.953
No.

12:32.020 --> 12:33.504
Ooh, a tennis court...

12:33.572 --> 12:37.408
"Not for law, instead for sport."

12:38.877 --> 12:41.279
Court... for sport.

12:42.180 --> 12:43.080
The Rivercourt!

12:43.165 --> 12:44.865
Yes!

12:44.917 --> 12:47.301
Ah, you are such a genius!

12:47.369 --> 12:49.654
- Maybe the next clue is there.
- Yeah.

12:49.721 --> 12:51.422
- Oh, man. I gotta get some stuff.
- Okay.

12:51.490 --> 12:53.441
A shovel... a flashlight...

12:53.508 --> 12:55.092
We're totally going on a treasure hunt!

13:01.049 --> 13:04.118
Well, this isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

13:04.186 --> 13:06.020
You feel like talking?

13:06.088 --> 13:08.055
Why, is that what the doctors told you?

13:08.106 --> 13:09.523
To try and get me to talk?

13:09.575 --> 13:12.193
I just thought you
might want to talk to me.

13:13.929 --> 13:16.430
Tell me about something you still love...

13:16.498 --> 13:18.950
Or about something you hate... anything.

13:21.620 --> 13:23.588
I hate traffic.

13:30.462 --> 13:33.464
You know what? You're right.

13:33.581 --> 13:35.416
It is a perfect day for a walk.

13:42.057 --> 13:44.942
Victoria? Alexander? Millicent?

13:48.096 --> 13:50.548
Really?!

13:50.616 --> 13:54.085
Please tell me Millicent
is not in there, too.

13:54.152 --> 13:56.103
Nope. She's in New York.

13:56.154 --> 13:57.538
And unfortunately, honey,

13:57.605 --> 14:00.441
I think I need to start thinking
about going back, as well.

14:00.509 --> 14:01.809
Why?

14:01.877 --> 14:03.911
Well, because the men's line is finished,

14:03.962 --> 14:07.665
and, uh, the offices to our
multimillion-dollar company are in New York.

14:07.749 --> 14:09.133
Well, what about your cub?

14:09.217 --> 14:10.985
I want to run Clothes For Bros.

14:11.053 --> 14:12.653
I designed it, and...

14:12.721 --> 14:15.890
We designed it, and... and no
one can sell it better than me.

14:15.957 --> 14:17.842
You want to run Clothes For Bros.

14:17.926 --> 14:19.293
That's right.

14:19.361 --> 14:21.312
And, um...

14:21.396 --> 14:23.014
I want to run it from New York.

14:24.266 --> 14:25.333
With Victoria.

14:30.072 --> 14:31.656
It's all a lie.

14:31.723 --> 14:34.275
Me and Josh, our relationship.

14:34.343 --> 14:37.094
See, he kind of made this sex tape of us,

14:37.162 --> 14:38.663
and I thought if we were together,

14:38.747 --> 14:40.014
maybe it wouldn't look so bad.

14:40.082 --> 14:41.949
Yeah, I've seen it.

14:42.017 --> 14:43.367
You're prettier in person.

14:45.003 --> 14:47.505
Well, I just... I want
someone stable, you know?

14:47.589 --> 14:52.293
Someone who's normal and reliable
and has, like, a regular job.

14:52.344 --> 14:53.511
Like a bartender?

14:54.713 --> 14:56.597
You're flirty like me. I like that.

14:56.664 --> 14:58.549
But you have a girlfriend.

14:58.617 --> 15:01.268
A famous, gorgeous, rock-star girlfriend.

15:01.336 --> 15:02.937
Had...

15:03.004 --> 15:04.805
as in not anymore.

15:04.856 --> 15:07.358
Cheers.

15:14.100 --> 15:19.520
Oh, I was thinking about
the finality of it all.

15:19.588 --> 15:22.907
How somebody can leave your
world in the blink of an eye

15:22.991 --> 15:25.493
and be gone forever.

15:25.544 --> 15:28.512
It's...

15:28.580 --> 15:31.365
it's too enormous to think about.

15:32.918 --> 15:34.785
It's too hard.

15:36.371 --> 15:37.888
And then we're just
supposed to go on, right?

15:37.973 --> 15:39.607
Like, just...

15:39.674 --> 15:41.175
Deal with it.

15:41.226 --> 15:43.561
I mean, really you're supposed to be sad

15:43.645 --> 15:45.262
for about as long as the flowers last,

15:45.347 --> 15:47.748
and then, oh, time to
go back to telling jokes

15:47.816 --> 15:50.735
and reminiscing about the old days.

15:52.766 --> 15:54.238
I don't have any jokes to tell.

15:58.059 --> 15:59.660
As a matter of fact,

15:59.727 --> 16:03.464
I hope I never hear another
joke as long as I live.

16:03.532 --> 16:06.500
And the old days are just... that.

16:06.568 --> 16:09.003
They're old days that are...

16:09.070 --> 16:11.005
gone.

16:11.072 --> 16:12.840
Check it out.

16:12.907 --> 16:15.209
"You can just score your
touchdowns, Mr. big shot,

16:15.260 --> 16:17.962
because math don't care and neither do I."

16:18.046 --> 16:20.714
It's not gonna change anything, Nathan.

16:20.766 --> 16:23.868
Whatever prize you find in
that box is not gonna fix me.

16:23.935 --> 16:25.352
Why not?

16:25.420 --> 16:26.887
It fixed me.

16:55.907 --> 16:57.241
What's going on?

16:57.309 --> 16:58.826
Just doing laundry.

16:58.894 --> 17:00.077
Car got towed.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.429
Car got towed?

17:01.496 --> 17:04.080
Yeah, it's a long story. I got it back.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.782
Check it out.

17:07.368 --> 17:09.403
These are my son's pants.

17:09.471 --> 17:11.238
The guy sees the world from down here.

17:11.306 --> 17:12.873
I haven't had the heart to tell him

17:12.924 --> 17:14.759
that the NBA's probably not in his future.

17:14.826 --> 17:18.295
Oh, I don't know, dude.
Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues.

17:18.380 --> 17:21.298
I love it when you talk
diminutive NBA point guards.

17:21.383 --> 17:23.916
So has Julian heard about Wasatch yet?

17:23.969 --> 17:26.854
No. And how do you know about that?

17:26.921 --> 17:28.088
I ran into him yesterday.

17:28.140 --> 17:29.440
That's all he could talk about.

17:29.508 --> 17:30.558
Well, he hasn't heard,

17:30.609 --> 17:33.160
but I did see a rough cut of
the movie and it's really good.

17:33.228 --> 17:34.412
Nice.

17:34.479 --> 17:35.312
How's Haley?

17:36.715 --> 17:39.266
Oh, she's pretty much
the same as last week.

17:39.317 --> 17:42.436
The doctors say that depression
is different for everybody,

17:42.487 --> 17:46.240
but... one day she might
just... feel better.

17:46.308 --> 17:48.292
They just don't know
when that day will be.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.027
Well, let's hope that day's today.

17:50.095 --> 17:51.679
Yeah.

17:51.747 --> 17:53.380
How are you and Jamie?

17:53.448 --> 17:54.632
I'm doing okay.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.567
I mean, I know she's not herself,

17:56.635 --> 17:59.403
but Jamie's struggling with it.

17:59.471 --> 18:02.506
He doesn't understand why his
mom is not his mom anymore.

18:02.591 --> 18:05.676
His whole life, she's been
nothing but consistent and sweet.

18:05.761 --> 18:07.628
And he can't be too thrilled about his dad

18:07.679 --> 18:09.013
turning all of his socks pink.

18:10.632 --> 18:13.267
You got to separate the
colors from the whites, buddy.

18:13.318 --> 18:14.819
Yeah.

18:14.903 --> 18:16.937
Other than that, I'm proud of you.

18:16.988 --> 18:19.123
You're exactly what Haley needs right now.

18:19.191 --> 18:22.426
Well, she's always been everything to us.

18:22.494 --> 18:25.579
Now it's time for us to be her everything.

18:27.666 --> 18:29.416
In sickness and in health, right?

18:29.484 --> 18:30.785
For better or worse.

18:30.852 --> 18:32.953
For better or for worse,

18:33.021 --> 18:34.622
to have and to hold,

18:34.673 --> 18:37.074
to love and to cherish,

18:37.142 --> 18:39.810
until death do you part?

18:39.878 --> 18:41.462
I do.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.202
Where do you think we should look?

18:51.203 --> 18:52.420
I don't know.

18:52.504 --> 18:54.338
You check the bleachers,
I'll look over here.

18:54.406 --> 18:55.256
Okay!

18:58.544 --> 18:59.927
You find anything yet?

19:00.012 --> 19:01.512
Not yet! You?

19:01.580 --> 19:02.964
No...

19:03.031 --> 19:04.849
Wait! Over here!

19:04.916 --> 19:05.850
I found another one!

19:10.022 --> 19:12.106
"Another clue is waiting near.

19:12.190 --> 19:14.525
First you must get past the fear.

19:14.593 --> 19:16.677
Not on a hill or up a mountain,

19:16.745 --> 19:18.312
make a wish into the... "

19:18.397 --> 19:19.814
the what?

19:19.882 --> 19:21.315
It doesn't say.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.118
"Not on a hill or up a mountain,

19:24.202 --> 19:27.188
make a wish into the... "

19:27.256 --> 19:29.523
Fountain! People make
wishes in the fountain!

19:29.591 --> 19:30.658
Yes!

19:30.726 --> 19:32.076
But which one?

19:32.127 --> 19:34.729
"First you must get past the fear... "

19:34.796 --> 19:36.130
Fear."

19:36.214 --> 19:38.015
The river! It's the cape fear river!

19:39.332 --> 19:41.161
The fountain!

19:41.253 --> 19:43.487
Come on, Aunt Quinn! Hurry!

19:46.100 --> 19:48.009
Hey. Tell me you're here to celebrate.

19:48.093 --> 19:49.226
Nope.

19:49.294 --> 19:50.628
At this point,

19:50.679 --> 19:53.014
more people are gonna see
your sex tape than this movie.

19:53.098 --> 19:54.382
First of all, don't be mean.

19:54.449 --> 19:56.050
Second of all, shouldn't you be editing?

19:56.118 --> 19:57.301
I'm taking a break.

19:57.352 --> 19:58.903
No, you're pouting, is what you're doing.

19:58.970 --> 20:00.488
Just like good old chase here.

20:00.572 --> 20:01.522
What are you pouting about?

20:01.607 --> 20:02.640
And I'll take a beer.

20:02.691 --> 20:03.858
I've heard about your mixed drinks.

20:03.942 --> 20:05.576
First of all, don't be mean.

20:05.644 --> 20:07.411
Second, I'm pouting because of this.

20:09.414 --> 20:10.581
"I don't think it's fair to you

20:10.649 --> 20:12.283
that I'm on the road most of the year

20:12.351 --> 20:14.151
and that my schedule
changes all the time.

20:14.202 --> 20:15.503
It's not fair to either of us.

20:15.587 --> 20:17.371
I wish things were
different, but they aren't.

20:17.456 --> 20:18.973
I'm sorry."

20:19.041 --> 20:21.108
Mia broke up with you by text message?

20:21.176 --> 20:24.595
Mia broke up with me over
a series of text messages.

20:24.663 --> 20:25.630
Texting's evil, man.

20:25.681 --> 20:28.916
I got this theory that if the
phone was invented after texting,

20:28.984 --> 20:30.851
we'd all be like, "this is amazing!

20:30.936 --> 20:32.670
You can actually hear their voice!"

20:32.738 --> 20:33.854
And nobody would text.

20:33.939 --> 20:35.806
Yeah, it's not so much the texting part,

20:35.857 --> 20:37.642
but the break-up part that bothers me.

20:37.693 --> 20:39.009
I'm sorry.

20:39.061 --> 20:40.695
That's too bad. Mia's a rock star.

20:42.047 --> 20:43.397
Literally.

20:43.482 --> 20:44.932
A really fine rock star.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.651
I'd totally sleep with her.

20:46.702 --> 20:48.619
Can you guys just drink
your drinks and go?

20:48.687 --> 20:50.137
I'm sorry.

20:50.205 --> 20:52.123
It's hard to date someone in
the entertainment industry.

20:52.190 --> 20:54.325
I mean, we're mostly gypsies, you know?

20:54.376 --> 20:56.360
We're never home. We're all needy as hell.

20:56.428 --> 20:58.112
Where is she right now, anyway?

20:58.180 --> 20:59.313
I don't even know.

20:59.381 --> 21:00.865
Paris... Spain.

21:00.932 --> 21:02.383
Tric.

21:05.310 --> 21:06.230
Hi.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.579
- Do you see it?
- Not yet.

21:17.794 --> 21:19.528
Maybe this is the treasure.

21:19.529 --> 21:22.081
That's other people's wishes! Put it back!

21:22.149 --> 21:23.182
Sorry.

21:23.250 --> 21:26.085
Look! There!

21:26.153 --> 21:28.037
Ah, yes!

21:28.105 --> 21:29.789
Oh, man, we're gonna get soaked!

21:29.856 --> 21:31.657
No, you're gonna get soaked.

21:33.700 --> 21:34.823
Maybe not.

21:39.100 --> 21:40.285
Nice.

21:40.684 --> 21:42.518
You are a genius.

21:50.429 --> 21:51.818
- You ready?
- Yeah.

22:01.399 --> 22:02.902
Hey! Get out of that fountain!

22:03.569 --> 22:05.771
Hurry! Come on!

22:05.838 --> 22:08.323
I got it! It's a clue!

22:08.408 --> 22:10.826
Come on!

22:17.600 --> 22:20.322
I have to tell myself to just be happy,

22:20.322 --> 22:22.949
but... I don't feel happy.

22:22.949 --> 22:24.950
And when I try to change it,

22:25.001 --> 22:28.304
when I try to remember
what being happy felt like,

22:28.371 --> 22:30.473
I... can't.

22:30.540 --> 22:32.558
I...

22:32.626 --> 22:35.761
Don't feel joy, I don't feel inspired.

22:35.829 --> 22:38.047
I feel numb.

22:42.886 --> 22:46.105
- Hi.
- Hi, darling.

22:47.674 --> 22:49.007
Hello, Haley.

22:49.059 --> 22:50.175
The last time I saw you,

22:50.227 --> 22:51.677
you were ruining my sister's exhibit.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.229
Oh, look at you go.

22:53.313 --> 22:55.364
But you know you're talking
to the queen of mean, sister.

22:55.448 --> 22:56.899
So you're gonna have
to do better than that.

22:56.983 --> 22:58.134
Mom.

22:58.201 --> 22:59.468
I'm gonna be outside.

22:59.536 --> 23:00.786
Haley.

23:00.854 --> 23:02.204
Haley, listen to me.

23:02.289 --> 23:04.290
I know you're in a great
deal of pain right now,

23:04.357 --> 23:05.791
but I also know that you're aware

23:05.859 --> 23:07.126
of the choices you're making.

23:07.193 --> 23:08.694
So I want you to listen to me,

23:08.745 --> 23:11.580
and then you can say something snarky
or dismissive and be on your way.

23:11.665 --> 23:13.315
But, please, sit. Please.

23:13.383 --> 23:15.417
Come on.

23:15.502 --> 23:16.535
Please.

23:18.588 --> 23:20.706
Your mother was proud of you.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.141
And it would break her heart

23:22.208 --> 23:26.328
to know that her beautiful,
kind, inspiring daughter

23:26.396 --> 23:27.813
was suffering like this.

23:27.881 --> 23:30.266
I know that because I'm a mother.

23:30.333 --> 23:31.867
And so are you.

23:31.935 --> 23:35.888
Now, our lives are difficult,

23:35.939 --> 23:39.191
and our loss unbearable sometimes.

23:39.242 --> 23:41.026
So grieve...

23:41.077 --> 23:42.561
and struggle,

23:42.612 --> 23:44.446
and you find your way
back on your own terms

23:44.531 --> 23:45.664
and in your own way.

23:45.732 --> 23:47.616
But remember this...

23:47.684 --> 23:50.119
your mother would want you
to be vibrant and inspiring

23:50.187 --> 23:51.570
in the face of her losing her.

23:51.621 --> 23:54.573
She'd want you to fight your
pain with all you've got.

23:54.624 --> 23:58.844
Because that's the
daughter that she raised.

23:58.912 --> 24:01.247
That's the daughter that she loved.

24:08.274 --> 24:10.843
"Every castle has a moat,

24:10.910 --> 24:13.762
every pirate has a boat.

24:13.830 --> 24:16.582
Find the clue near tugboats red,

24:16.666 --> 24:19.852
in the ship that's sleeping dead."

24:19.919 --> 24:21.637
"Sleeping dead."

24:24.774 --> 24:27.676
I'd say that boat is sleeping dead.

24:27.743 --> 24:29.128
Oh, yeah.

24:30.613 --> 24:31.913
Be careful!

24:31.965 --> 24:33.182
Goof.

24:39.422 --> 24:41.407
When'd you get back?

24:41.474 --> 24:42.624
About an hour ago.

24:42.692 --> 24:46.261
Miranda needs help running the
label while Haley's not feeling well.

24:46.329 --> 24:48.730
And I wouldn't have a career
if it weren't for Red Bedroom,

24:48.798 --> 24:51.183
so I told them I wanted to help out.

24:51.251 --> 24:53.869
I'm sure they appreciate it.

24:53.937 --> 24:56.605
So, you'll be around here for a while.

24:56.656 --> 24:59.475
I think so. Yeah.

24:59.542 --> 25:01.827
That's good.

25:01.911 --> 25:04.797
You got to delete those texts.

25:04.881 --> 25:06.632
Yeah. I did.

25:06.716 --> 25:07.633
No, you didn't.

25:07.717 --> 25:08.667
How do you know?

25:08.735 --> 25:10.085
Because I know you.

25:10.153 --> 25:12.604
You've been sitting around
reading the same words

25:12.672 --> 25:15.174
over and over, and it's not good for you.

25:15.258 --> 25:16.809
I don't know how it happened,

25:16.893 --> 25:18.127
so I keep reading what we said...

25:18.194 --> 25:20.462
well, what we wrote...

25:20.513 --> 25:22.297
Hoping that when I get to the end,

25:22.365 --> 25:24.983
maybe the ending will be different. But...

25:25.068 --> 25:26.801
It's always the same.

25:26.853 --> 25:30.322
Does it help if I say I care
about you and I always will?

25:30.406 --> 25:33.392
Nope.

25:33.460 --> 25:36.161
It just reminds me how beautiful you are.

25:36.229 --> 25:38.697
And that just kind of makes it worse.

25:44.225 --> 25:46.511
It'll be okay.

25:49.848 --> 25:51.315
By the way, who's
running the bar right now?

25:52.345 --> 25:55.731
I could totally get used
to this bartending thing.

25:56.657 --> 25:57.624
Check it out.

26:01.584 --> 26:04.269
Nice. Nice.

26:05.005 --> 26:07.841
So, what's the big deal about
this film festival anyway?

26:07.892 --> 26:09.559
It'll help us sell the film.

26:09.643 --> 26:11.261
Which you're gonna do because it's good,

26:11.345 --> 26:13.146
but let's play "worst case scenario."

26:13.213 --> 26:16.349
What happens if the film
doesn't sell? Then what?

26:16.400 --> 26:18.268
I get some rope and a ladder.

26:18.352 --> 26:19.986
Okay, normally not funny,

26:20.053 --> 26:22.772
but considering you're talking to a person

26:22.857 --> 26:25.692
who actually attempted
suicide, really not funny.

26:25.743 --> 26:27.444
Right. Sorry.

26:27.528 --> 26:32.332
If the film doesn't sell, then all
that work will amount to nothing.

26:32.332 --> 26:33.616
Nothing.

26:33.617 --> 26:35.618
You mean like "working with your father,

26:35.686 --> 26:39.572
getting Brooke back, and
saving my life" nothing?

26:39.640 --> 26:44.144
Whatever happens, this movie
will always be the greatest thing

26:44.211 --> 26:45.545
that ever happened to me.

26:45.596 --> 26:47.130
It saved my life.

26:47.198 --> 26:49.132
You saved my life.

26:49.200 --> 26:55.638
And I got to watch a truly amazing
director direct his first film.

26:55.706 --> 26:58.408
I'd say that amounts to a
little bit more than nothing.

26:59.794 --> 27:01.478
Wow.

27:01.562 --> 27:04.330
You know what? You're absolutely right.

27:04.398 --> 27:05.315
Thank you, Alex.

27:07.434 --> 27:11.254
All right. I got to go work on our movie.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.157
I found it!

27:14.241 --> 27:15.658
What?!

27:15.726 --> 27:17.460
It's in this bottle.

27:17.545 --> 27:19.045
Nice work, buddy!

27:19.112 --> 27:20.764
Stand back while I break it.

27:20.831 --> 27:22.132
Watch your eyes.

27:22.199 --> 27:23.133
Okay.

27:26.286 --> 27:27.654
Okay, let me get it. Here.

27:30.508 --> 27:33.143
"In your hands this final clue,

27:33.227 --> 27:34.627
if you know just what to do.

27:34.678 --> 27:36.796
Place it with the other three,

27:36.847 --> 27:39.465
and the treasure you will see."

27:40.684 --> 27:41.818
I don't get it.

27:43.220 --> 27:46.739
Well, remember the design on the back?

27:48.242 --> 27:50.243
- It's a map!
- Mm-hmm.

27:50.311 --> 27:51.477
There's the Rivercourt,

27:51.529 --> 27:53.079
the fountain, and the sleeping boat.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.371
I know where the treasure is. Come on!

28:17.137 --> 28:18.805
Hello?

28:36.290 --> 28:37.874
Do you know this woman?

28:39.243 --> 28:41.361
Yeah, she's my wife.

28:56.850 --> 28:58.559
- What's this?
- I'm going with you.

28:59.227 --> 29:01.629
- Michael...
- I know it's only been a few weeks.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.230
I feel like you could love me,

29:03.298 --> 29:04.832
and I know that I could love you.

29:04.900 --> 29:06.100
Michael, listen to me.

29:06.168 --> 29:07.635
You have a record to finish,

29:07.702 --> 29:09.820
and I have a life to
live, and that's okay.

29:09.871 --> 29:11.172
I have to leave, and you have to stay.

29:11.239 --> 29:12.573
You're wrong.

29:12.657 --> 29:14.525
You have to go. I don't have to stay.

29:14.576 --> 29:15.993
I want to go with you.

29:16.044 --> 29:18.429
But you don't understand!
I don't want you to come!

29:21.299 --> 29:23.467
I'm sorry, Grubbs.

29:25.654 --> 29:27.054
Goodbye.

29:32.561 --> 29:35.479
It's got to be around here somewhere.

29:35.547 --> 29:37.348
I don't know, Jame.

29:37.399 --> 29:40.100
Maybe we're in the wrong spot.

29:40.185 --> 29:41.218
Look!

29:42.487 --> 29:43.370
Treasure!

29:45.824 --> 29:47.408
Yes!

29:47.492 --> 29:48.609
Come on.

30:13.969 --> 30:16.136
You told me to never come back.

30:16.204 --> 30:18.272
I know I did.

30:18.356 --> 30:19.923
But I was wrong.

30:19.975 --> 30:23.110
I'm... I'm just gonna be here, okay?

30:23.178 --> 30:25.029
I'll jump. I mean it.

30:25.096 --> 30:27.781
No, you won't.

30:27.866 --> 30:30.150
You wouldn't have jumped
off that bridge in college

30:30.235 --> 30:31.952
if I hadn't been there to hold your hand.

30:32.020 --> 30:34.171
You said you didn't believe me.

30:34.239 --> 30:36.824
I was just afraid of loving you again.

30:36.892 --> 30:41.378
The way that I used to and
the way that I still do.

30:41.446 --> 30:44.999
Tell me you love me, Clay.

30:45.066 --> 30:49.587
Tell me you love me
and that you believe me.

30:49.654 --> 30:51.722
Please.

30:51.789 --> 30:53.474
Or I'll jump.

30:53.558 --> 30:54.508
Don't. Okay?

30:56.111 --> 30:57.895
Sara, don't leave me again.

31:00.115 --> 31:02.366
I love you.

31:04.753 --> 31:06.520
Just take my hand...

31:06.605 --> 31:08.572
and we can be together.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.691
Please?

31:10.775 --> 31:13.360
On the count of two?

31:13.428 --> 31:15.396
One...

31:15.463 --> 31:16.730
two.

31:16.798 --> 31:19.767
It's okay. You're okay. See?

31:19.834 --> 31:22.002
I finally have you back.

31:23.905 --> 31:26.624
No! Stop it! Clay!

31:26.675 --> 31:28.259
It's okay, Katie. They're gonna help you.

31:28.326 --> 31:30.811
Wait. You called me Katie.

31:30.879 --> 31:33.764
But I'm Sara! You said you loved me!

31:33.831 --> 31:36.884
No, Katie. I love Quinn.

31:36.968 --> 31:38.535
Sara's gone.

31:45.627 --> 31:46.627
Yes!

31:46.695 --> 31:47.945
Oh, yeah!

31:48.012 --> 31:49.029
We found it!

31:49.097 --> 31:50.314
No, you found it.

31:50.382 --> 31:51.582
It's all yours.

31:51.650 --> 31:53.150
Really?

31:53.201 --> 31:54.151
Open it up.

31:54.202 --> 31:56.036
Oh, I wish mom was here.

31:56.121 --> 31:57.087
Me too.

31:57.155 --> 31:58.906
Oh.

31:59.024 --> 31:59.740
Treasure!

32:00.825 --> 32:02.526
Oh, it's so cool!

32:02.577 --> 32:05.829
Look at all those
dimes. Oh, this is crazy!

32:05.880 --> 32:07.998
- Sweet!
- Cool.

32:08.066 --> 32:09.566
Look at this one.

32:09.634 --> 32:11.251
Yeah!

32:14.205 --> 32:15.255
I don't think we should keep it.

32:15.340 --> 32:16.757
Why not?

32:16.825 --> 32:18.809
Well

32:18.876 --> 32:20.561
I was thinking...

32:20.629 --> 32:23.380
The Goonies wanted to save their homes.

32:23.431 --> 32:25.949
That's why they needed the treasure.

32:26.017 --> 32:28.902
So, maybe someone needs
this more than I do.

32:28.987 --> 32:30.704
Having a home is important.

32:30.772 --> 32:33.490
I think that's wonderful.

32:33.558 --> 32:37.645
But are you sure there's not
anything you want to keep?

32:37.712 --> 32:41.415
Um... maybe just one thing.

32:49.407 --> 32:50.958
I just want mama to be okay.

32:51.042 --> 32:52.076
That's all I want.

32:52.143 --> 32:54.144
Me too.

32:54.212 --> 32:56.547
Come on, let's get this buried again.

33:12.100 --> 33:15.211
It's nice, isn't it?

33:15.211 --> 33:18.252
I remember when you found
out I was opening this store.

33:18.319 --> 33:19.820
You were not very happy.

33:19.904 --> 33:21.572
And you like it here.

33:21.623 --> 33:24.375
In Tree Hill? Please.

33:24.442 --> 33:27.911
I like being near my daughter.

33:27.962 --> 33:29.747
Yeah, if that's your story.

33:29.798 --> 33:31.248
So, be honest with me.

33:31.299 --> 33:34.117
Should I let Alexander
run Clothes For Bros?

33:34.169 --> 33:37.237
No, you should let Millicent
run Clothes For Bros.

33:37.305 --> 33:39.973
Alexander's a designer.
He should be designing.

33:40.058 --> 33:41.759
Have you told him that?

33:41.810 --> 33:44.812
I thought I'd tell him
in the next few days.

33:44.896 --> 33:46.563
Why spoil the next few nights?

33:48.750 --> 33:52.519
Maybe you're afraid of committing to him.

33:52.604 --> 33:56.023
Of having him in New York
and in your world every day.

33:56.107 --> 33:57.808
Of falling in love.

33:59.477 --> 34:02.529
He's a boy, Brooke. No
one's falling in love.

34:02.597 --> 34:04.114
He is.

34:06.918 --> 34:08.819
I'm gonna miss this.

34:08.870 --> 34:12.822
The best part about this company
has been building it with you.

34:12.873 --> 34:15.542
Spending time with you.
I used to dream about it.

34:16.928 --> 34:18.594
Thank you, mom.

34:18.663 --> 34:20.496
Thank you.

34:23.100 --> 34:25.886
My beautiful daughter.

34:32.286 --> 34:34.983
This mascara is defective!

34:35.396 --> 34:36.897
They're called tears, mother.

34:36.981 --> 34:39.516
You can feel them because
the botox is wearing off.

34:39.567 --> 34:41.952
You're such a little bitch!

34:42.018 --> 34:43.904
And I mean it in a good way.

34:43.987 --> 34:46.456
Alexander's a good guy...

34:46.524 --> 34:49.126
And he is a good designer,

34:49.194 --> 34:51.043
and the line wouldn't
be the same without him,

34:51.129 --> 34:52.429
so I'm gonna give him the job.

34:52.496 --> 34:54.831
He'll report to you, of course,

34:54.899 --> 34:56.583
and Millicent will be the vice president.

34:56.668 --> 34:58.552
You're the boss.

35:00.054 --> 35:02.840
So you really think
he's... falling in love?

35:02.891 --> 35:04.141
I do.

35:04.208 --> 35:06.593
That would be kind of nice.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.806
I'm a...

35:13.601 --> 35:16.603
I'm so proud of you.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.447
And I love you.

35:22.994 --> 35:24.561
And I love you, too.

35:28.833 --> 35:30.784
See you soon. Okay.

36:05.436 --> 36:06.653
There you go.

36:06.738 --> 36:08.271
Thank you, Aunt Quinn.

36:08.323 --> 36:10.207
For what, handsome?

36:10.275 --> 36:11.375
For all of this.

36:11.442 --> 36:13.277
I know you did it all for me,

36:13.344 --> 36:15.896
and it was one of the
best days I ever had.

36:15.964 --> 36:17.664
Thank you. I love you.

36:17.749 --> 36:19.750
Mm, I love you, too.

36:20.952 --> 36:22.452
We all do.

36:22.503 --> 36:24.221
Okay, you ready?

36:46.527 --> 36:49.329
There's a journal that
my wife used to keep.

36:49.414 --> 36:51.198
It pretty much documents
our life together,

36:51.282 --> 36:52.833
and it's missing.

36:52.917 --> 36:54.701
I'd like to have it back.

37:13.504 --> 37:15.171
Hi.

37:15.223 --> 37:16.607
I'm Mia.

37:16.674 --> 37:18.875
I'm gonna be around for a
while helping to run the label.

37:20.278 --> 37:22.162
Miranda told me.

37:24.032 --> 37:27.167
Why don't we start by, um,
listening to your record?

37:27.235 --> 37:29.453
Sure.

37:30.855 --> 37:32.255
But I'm gonna need a second.

37:32.323 --> 37:35.409
I... just had my heart broken.

37:35.476 --> 37:37.744
Yeah, me too.

38:28.850 --> 38:32.185
Jamie's asleep, and I think Haley is, too.

38:32.270 --> 38:33.603
You okay?

38:34.772 --> 38:36.940
Your mom had a cellphone.

38:37.008 --> 38:38.442
Do you know where it is?

38:38.493 --> 38:41.094
Yeah, it's in a box of
stuff at the gallery. Why?

38:53.758 --> 38:55.592
You were out late.

38:55.659 --> 38:57.644
I was watching the movie again.

38:57.712 --> 38:58.645
And?

39:00.214 --> 39:03.183
It's a good film. I like it.

39:03.267 --> 39:07.354
And the wardrobe is unbelievable.

39:07.438 --> 39:08.305
Really?

39:13.027 --> 39:14.844
Imagine that.

39:14.896 --> 39:19.199
The Wasatch Valley Film Festival.

39:24.622 --> 39:25.956
Hello?

39:27.031 --> 39:28.475
You have 27 messages.

39:34.699 --> 39:36.983
First message.

39:37.051 --> 39:39.319
Hi, mom. It's me.

39:47.408 --> 39:48.617
I know you're gone...

39:49.100 --> 39:53.567
and you're not coming back, but...

39:54.018 --> 39:56.286
I was just thinking, maybe...

39:56.354 --> 39:58.321
somehow I could see you again

39:58.389 --> 40:01.441
or be able to talk to
you or hear your voice.

40:04.278 --> 40:07.414
I snapped at Jamie today again.

40:07.498 --> 40:10.033
And he didn't deserve it,
and I don't know why I did it.

40:10.101 --> 40:11.101
I just did.

40:16.541 --> 40:19.759
He deserves better
than who I am right now.

40:19.827 --> 40:21.628
And so does Nathan.

40:24.015 --> 40:28.885
Every day we ignore how
truly broken this world is,

40:28.936 --> 40:33.590
and we tell ourselves
it's all going to be okay.

40:38.279 --> 40:41.898
But it's not gonna be
okay. I know that now.

40:42.305 --> 40:48.217
