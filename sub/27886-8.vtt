09:59.640 --> 10:02.268
The wild one caught again.

10:02.351 --> 10:03.436
Feral motherfucker.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.187
Sweet as can be.

10:05.771 --> 10:06.606
Here. Come here.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.858
-How are you? I missed you.
-[door chimes]

10:10.067 --> 10:12.278
-[Nadia] Hey, Ferran.
-Nadia.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.071
Show us some of your best condoms.

10:17.158 --> 10:17.992
Alan.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.872
Alan, are you okay?

10:23.623 --> 10:27.501
Hey. So happy to see you.
I'm so glad you're alive. [chuckles]

10:28.002 --> 10:29.920
You know what?
Give me a little space, hippie.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.547
-Nice scarf.
-[Mike laughs]

10:36.761 --> 10:37.928
[both] Oh, fuck.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.807
[both] Oh, fuck.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.269
Nadia, you seriously don't remember me?

10:46.812 --> 10:49.649
I'm sorry, man. I think I just have
one of those faces, you know?

10:50.274 --> 10:51.317
No.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.819
No, no, no, Nadia, you do know me. We...

10:53.903 --> 10:54.862
We die, we come back,

10:54.945 --> 10:57.073
and now we're trying to figure out
how to make it stop.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.951
Oh, my God. All right, man, you're
starting to give me the heebie-jeebies.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.244
[Alan breathes shakily]

11:02.828 --> 11:05.247
If you're not the Nadia who remembers me,

11:05.831 --> 11:07.208
you could die permanently.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.252
I need you to remember me.
I need you to.

11:10.336 --> 11:13.714
-Look, dude, dude, hold on, hold on.
-Man, I need you to back the fuck up.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.424
-Do you know this guy?
-No.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.968
-I know her better than you do, Mike.
-Do we know each other?

11:18.052 --> 11:20.179
-You're fucking my girlfriend.
-I didn't fuck her yet.

11:20.262 --> 11:22.390
-Well, I'm not your girlfriend.
-Not her.

11:22.473 --> 11:23.599
One of your grad students.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.684
Oh, Jenny?

11:25.309 --> 11:28.187
Oh, my God, you are
seriously a fucking dick.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.022
It's not a deal breaker for me.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.107
-Okay.
-All right, come on.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.693
-We didn't get the condoms.
-Also not a deal breaker.

11:34.610 --> 11:35.736
[Nadia] Eh.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.655
-Okay.
-Raw dog!

11:37.738 --> 11:38.948
[Mike laughs]

11:39.031 --> 11:39.865
[Nadia] This way.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.535
Oh, fuck me. Oh, God.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.788
Alan! Alan! Be careful, dude.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.083
What the hell?

11:50.918 --> 11:54.338
Alan, you're just drunk, all right?
Let's go get you sobered up.

11:54.922 --> 11:55.756
No.

11:56.632 --> 11:59.135
No, n-- nothing even matters anymore.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.723
My failure is a failure is a failure.

12:03.806 --> 12:07.017
Hey, look, man. I know you're wasted,
but I don't give a fuck.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.686
No, no, no, no. Beatrice!

12:08.769 --> 12:10.855
Man, fuck, fuck, fuck Beatrice, okay?

12:10.938 --> 12:12.940
-You're the person I care about.
-Don't touch me.

12:13.023 --> 12:14.859
-Don't!
-Hey. Hey, man.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.737
-I'm trying to save your life.
-[man] Hey, Little Red Riding Hood.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.739
Is this sad man messing with you?

12:19.822 --> 12:22.116
You know, like, take a left at Disneyland.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.242
Are you all right?

12:23.325 --> 12:25.578
-I just broke it, man.
-That's okay. We'll take care of it.

12:25.661 --> 12:26.746
-I'm sorry.
-Just-- Just...

12:26.829 --> 12:28.372
-[Nadia] Not you fucking guys.
-But I'll fix it.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.792
Are we gonna play this game all night
or are we leaving together?

12:31.876 --> 12:32.835
Ah...

12:33.335 --> 12:37.840
You are making me want to throw up,
Daffy Dick. Get the fuck out of here.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.885
-She says that like it's a problem.
-Okay, that's it. Everybody out.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.970
I gotta help my friend.
I'm sorry, you too, Nadia.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.931
No, no, no. I don't think you understand.
He's my friend too. I know him.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.725
-Look, you don't know him like I do.
-Alan.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.810
He's in a bad way. Inner circle only.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.520
Dude, I am inner circle.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.355
No, you're not. Come on.
Give me five minutes.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.441
-You're fucking up, man.
-I'm fucking up?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.737
Alan, come on, man.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.162
[door opens]

13:21.717 --> 13:23.594
Nadia, I know.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.805
I know. You're--
you're a skeptical person.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.307
I respect that, but you are
making decisions tonight

13:28.390 --> 13:30.434
that are putting your life in danger.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.978
-My God, this guy doesn't give up.
-[Mike] I know.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.523
Nadia, you're gonna get hit by a car
and die tonight.

13:35.898 --> 13:39.819
Oh, my God, I'm sorry. Is this some kind
of a creepy <i>Dead Zone</i> scenario?

13:39.902 --> 13:42.822
-You're actually harassing us, okay?
-[Nadia] Yes, you're harassing.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.365
He's fucking with you to fuck with me

13:44.448 --> 13:46.784
because I made his girlfriend
see God or something.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.661
-Let's go.
-Wait, you make people see God?

13:48.744 --> 13:50.496
-[Mike] Yeah.
-[Nadia] I'll take it.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.666
What I do with my time
is my business, my choice, baby.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.709
No, no, he is not a choice.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.962
He is the hole where the choice should be.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.466
You need to back the fuck off, all right?

14:02.550 --> 14:06.303
Ten feet or I'm not responsible
for what I might do.

14:08.138 --> 14:08.973
[Nadia] Yeah.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.684
-Yeah.
-I'm just trying to...

14:11.767 --> 14:14.311
consensually screw
this young lady in peace.

14:14.812 --> 14:18.816
Okay, looks like somebody's trying
to consensually screw

14:18.899 --> 14:21.068
this young lady in peace.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.533
No. No.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.244
Now do guys like blow jobs
or that's a rumor?

14:30.327 --> 14:31.787
Love 'em, love 'em, love 'em.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.122
-Oh, yeah?
-Big fans.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.707
I'll tell you what else too...

14:37.418 --> 14:38.586
[camera shutter clicks]

14:42.756 --> 14:43.757
[smooching]

14:43.841 --> 14:45.593
-[Mike] I fucking want you.
-[Nadia] Oh, okay.

14:45.676 --> 14:46.677
[Mike] Fucking right here.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.846
-I'll get at it right now.
-[Nadia laughs]

14:48.929 --> 14:51.891
-[cell phone vibrating]
-Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.481
[scoffs] I'm just too busy. I can't.

15:19.919 --> 15:20.753
Hi.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.504
Hey, uh, I'm just gonna grab this two-top.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.298
I'm trying to keep an eye
on that gentleman.

15:24.381 --> 15:27.384
I'm worried he might kill himself,
but I got to keep it on the QT, cool?

15:27.968 --> 15:30.679
-What you having?
-Cup of coffee. Thanks.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.642
Hey, Alan.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.227
Hey, Alan, are you awake?

15:37.311 --> 15:38.520
-Mmm.
-[cell phone vibrates]

15:38.604 --> 15:39.438
Oh.

15:39.521 --> 15:41.649
Fuck, uh... I gotta take this.
It's my girlfriend.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.943
Just give me two minutes, all right?
You stay put.
Hey, just grabbing some food with Alan.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.115
-Yeah.
-[fork clatters]

16:01.460 --> 16:02.461
[spoon clatters]

16:19.228 --> 16:20.479
[spoon clatters]

16:29.822 --> 16:30.906
Oh, yeah, thanks.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.161
Fucking God damn it.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.248
[sighs]

16:41.458 --> 16:42.376
[door chimes]

16:42.459 --> 16:44.628
-Do you have Nadia's number?
-Yeah.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.714
-Can you call her for me?
-Why?

16:46.797 --> 16:49.466
-Tell her I found her cat.
-I can't lie about Oatmeal.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.343
Why don't you have her number?
I thought you knew her.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.388
I do know her. I know her better
than she knows herself right now.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.141
I do have her number.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.268
Oh.
Yeah.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.991
-[Mike breathing heavily]
-[jazz music playing]

17:30.090 --> 17:30.924
Ah...

17:31.508 --> 17:34.219
-We really skipped the condoms, huh?
-Yeah, we did.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.180
[Nadia] Don't worry about it.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.390
[cell phone vibrating]

17:44.063 --> 17:45.939
Hey. Did Oatmeal show up?

17:46.607 --> 17:49.193
No, but Alan's here
and he wanted me to tell you--

17:49.276 --> 17:51.361
Who? <i>Dead Zone?</i> Nice fucking guy.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.697
You tell
this Cronenberg-looking motherfucker

17:53.781 --> 17:55.240
that I don't like stalkers.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.700
Mostly.

17:56.784 --> 18:02.539
He said that you owe him $152,780.86.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.418
All right, uh...

18:07.211 --> 18:09.004
[sighs] I need cigarettes anyway.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.589
[sighs]

18:11.340 --> 18:12.633
[softly] What the fuck?

18:16.011 --> 18:16.970
She's on her way.

18:17.054 --> 18:17.888
Ah.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.269
[exhales]

18:25.479 --> 18:27.147
-Hey.
-[Mike] Want me to go with you?

18:27.231 --> 18:28.732
No, you lazy fuck.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.068
And you don't get points
for offering, either.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.987
Listen, don't touch my stuff
while I'm gone.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.531
-I'll know.
-[Mike] All right.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.326
Oh, Jesus. Fuck.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.247
-[breathing heavily]
-[messages chiming]

18:43.330 --> 18:44.915
That's a lot of messages.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.801
Hey, man, can you spare some change?

18:56.260 --> 18:57.177
Spare some change?

18:57.261 --> 18:59.263
-I can do better than that.
-Yeah?

19:04.893 --> 19:07.479
You're supposed
to get down on one knee, aren't you?

19:08.814 --> 19:09.982
[Alan laughs]

19:10.774 --> 19:12.651
Let's-- Let's-- Oh, uh...

19:12.734 --> 19:14.945
-[Alan laughs]
-[Horse] I thought you'd never ask.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.238
-Yes!
-Yeah?

19:16.321 --> 19:18.115
-Yes! Yes!
-Yes!

19:18.198 --> 19:19.408
A hundred times yes!
[both laugh]

19:20.784 --> 19:22.619
-[Horse] Whoo!
-[Alan laughs]

19:22.703 --> 19:24.121
-Let me see this.
-[Alan laughs]

19:24.204 --> 19:25.080
Wow.

19:25.789 --> 19:27.416
-Here. Come with me.
-Yeah?

19:27.791 --> 19:28.834
Uh, this way.

19:28.917 --> 19:29.751
[Alan laughs]

19:30.169 --> 19:32.045
[Horse] No funny business, okay?

19:32.129 --> 19:34.882
-[Alan] I'm a married man.
-[Horse] Yeah.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.633
We're, uh-- We're true.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.765
[woman] Hey, Horsey. [laughs]

19:44.349 --> 19:45.559
We got one.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.396
I bet you want a hit.

19:49.855 --> 19:50.731
Yeah.

19:52.816 --> 19:53.984
You gonna pay for that?

19:54.568 --> 19:56.069
Yeah, of course.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.196
Yeah, of course.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.076
[woman] What's in that wallet?

20:07.331 --> 20:09.708
You know what? Take-- Take it all.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.669
Take everything. I don't need any of it.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.297
I don't need any of it anymore. No. Here.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.091
Yeah. Take it.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.053
All right. All right, enough.
Let's get out of here.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.888
[Horse] Hey, haircut, is he with you?

20:22.971 --> 20:24.598
-Yeah, man.
-[woman] Fucking loser.

20:24.681 --> 20:27.893
-Okay, we're gonna keep his things.
-All right, good for you, man.

20:41.823 --> 20:42.950
[door chimes]

20:43.492 --> 20:44.326
Uh-huh.

20:44.409 --> 20:49.289
Okay, man, you have got exactly as long
as it takes me to buy these cigarettes

20:49.373 --> 20:51.166
to tell me what the hell is happening.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.335
You told me that time is relative.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.879
Actually, your buddy Einstein said that.

20:56.296 --> 21:00.384
Metaphysically speaking, you and I
are intrinsically and inexplicably linked.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.343
Mm-hmm.

21:01.426 --> 21:04.179
And I'm convinced our true purpose
is to to connect with each other,

21:04.263 --> 21:06.390
if not help save each other's lives.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.768
In another world, hopefully
you are doing the same for me.

21:10.310 --> 21:11.144
Time's up.

21:15.732 --> 21:16.775
I know where Oatmeal is.

21:18.151 --> 21:19.945
-Where?
-In the park.

21:21.613 --> 21:22.447
Hmm.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.658
Let's go get him.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.079
[door chimes]

21:34.501 --> 21:36.753
I mean, this is
a very particular challenge.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.630
What's wrong?

21:38.714 --> 21:40.716
Alan, I am worried about you

21:40.799 --> 21:42.676
and I'd like to keep you
from hurting yourself.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.470
Mmm-mmm. I feel terrific.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.098
All right, Alan,
I-- I know what you're up to, okay?

21:48.181 --> 21:49.683
And I'm sure that you do feel fantastic

21:49.766 --> 21:53.228
'cause that's how a lot of people feel
when they've decided to kill themselves.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.272
The emotional buoyancy,
giving things to strangers,

21:55.355 --> 21:57.232
proposing to gutter punks, et cetera.

21:57.649 --> 21:58.567
[Nadia sighs]

21:58.984 --> 22:01.903
I'm sorry. Can I lay down? Uh...
I just-- My heart's palpitating.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.662
Are you gonna put me to sleep?

22:12.789 --> 22:13.623
Mmm.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.502
Yes. Yes, I am.

22:17.961 --> 22:18.795
Oh.

22:20.630 --> 22:21.506
Mmm.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.175
Would you like to hear a story?

22:24.384 --> 22:25.302
Sure.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.595
Okay.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.180
There we go.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.727
[Alan groans]

22:33.810 --> 22:35.103
Did you ever hear the one

22:35.187 --> 22:39.691
about the broken man
and the lady with a death wish

22:39.775 --> 22:40.901
who got stuck in a loop?

22:41.568 --> 22:42.444
Tell me.

22:45.405 --> 22:46.698
Once upon a time...

22:47.115 --> 22:50.660
there was a very special boy named Alan.

22:51.745 --> 22:52.829
And one day...

22:53.747 --> 22:55.415
life got to be too much for him.

22:55.916 --> 22:59.294
So he decided to take a walk
off the side of the roof.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.838
But on his way down,

23:02.297 --> 23:03.673
a very tough lady,

23:04.257 --> 23:06.134
who looked like if Andrew Dice Clay

23:06.218 --> 23:08.637
and the little girl from <i>Brave</i>
made a baby,

23:08.720 --> 23:11.014
she caught him in her crazy hair...

23:11.640 --> 23:13.308
like it was a dolphins' net.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.519
I love <i>Brave.</i>

23:16.645 --> 23:17.646
And I love Dice...

23:18.188 --> 23:21.191
which I'm sure
will eventually become problematic.

23:22.859 --> 23:23.860
Anyway...

23:23.944 --> 23:27.656
uh, even though the girl caught him...

23:27.739 --> 23:31.284
well, now, you see,
she wasn't in such hot shape either.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.288
You see, life was too painful.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.583
Or they were too fragile.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.587
But either way you slice it,
they just couldn't hack it.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.549
And then one night...

23:46.466 --> 23:48.593
something miraculous happened.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.638
They made it through alive.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.519
Yeah, he's-- he's around here somewhere.

23:57.894 --> 23:58.728
Yeah.

23:59.354 --> 24:01.982
All right, man,
how'd you know about my college fund?

24:03.400 --> 24:04.651
-You told me.
-Mmm.

24:05.235 --> 24:07.446
Well, I never talk about shit from then,
so it seems weird

24:07.529 --> 24:09.948
that I would've told somebody
that I don't know that.

24:10.031 --> 24:11.658
I'm telling you we know each other.

24:11.741 --> 24:13.660
Okay, great,
what else do you know about me?

24:15.120 --> 24:16.079
It's your birthday.

24:18.915 --> 24:21.793
That's why it's weird
that you said I would die tonight.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.422
I've always been superstitious
about this particular birthday.

24:25.505 --> 24:26.423
'Cause of your mother.

24:33.680 --> 24:34.848
[Alan groans]

24:35.390 --> 24:37.100
Fuck. Nadia!

24:37.767 --> 24:39.811
Nadia, wait. Look, I'm-- I'm sorry.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.855
I'm not trying to freak you out
or anything.

24:41.938 --> 24:43.773
Oh, shit, look who it is.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.192
No, I know that guy.

24:45.775 --> 24:49.154
He's self-destructive
and he's fucking dangerous.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.406
He does not seem to like you, huh?

24:51.490 --> 24:55.619
Hey, he's mentally unstable. I'm serious.
Get away from him. The guy's crazy.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.412
-Okay, then.
-[vehicle approaching]

24:57.496 --> 24:59.039
-Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Wait!
-[horn honks]

24:59.122 --> 25:02.292
-[Nadia gasps]
-Jesus Christ.

25:04.419 --> 25:06.254
-Did you just save my life?
-Yeah.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.297
Why?

25:07.380 --> 25:08.715
I told you I know you.

25:12.886 --> 25:15.680
I can't handle this shit, man.
This is just too much for me.

25:15.764 --> 25:16.681
No.

25:17.766 --> 25:18.600
[sighs]

25:27.776 --> 25:29.361
[sirens wailing]

25:43.041 --> 25:44.042
No.

25:44.876 --> 25:45.752
[exhales]

25:56.555 --> 25:58.014
[breathing heavily]

26:03.645 --> 26:07.440
You damn dumb, dumb fucking cunt.

26:08.483 --> 26:09.317
Fuck.

26:10.652 --> 26:11.611
[exhales]

26:11.695 --> 26:13.196
[breathing heavily]

26:27.961 --> 26:29.254
Fuck.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.096
[cries softly]

26:44.144 --> 26:45.186
What's wrong?

26:47.814 --> 26:49.983
I am so fucking happy
that you did not jump.
You promise
if I don't jump, I'll be happy?

26:56.698 --> 26:57.782
I don't know, man.

26:58.491 --> 26:59.951
Absolutely not.

27:01.411 --> 27:05.248
But I can promise you
that you will not be alone.

27:09.044 --> 27:09.919
Okay.
What now?

27:14.049 --> 27:17.344
Now we get the fuck off of this roof
before you change your mind.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.805
["Alone Again Or" playing]

27:28.605 --> 27:30.523
I'm sorry. This is all about me.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.317
Uh, I was seeing this girl, right?

27:32.400 --> 27:36.112
And, uh, it's early days,
but it could be something, you know?

27:36.196 --> 27:38.531
And she told me she's got
this crazy boyfriend.

27:39.157 --> 27:43.870
And I took that to be hyperbolic, but I
never imagined that it would... you know?

27:43.953 --> 27:46.247
-What? What's the matter?
-Come on.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.876
[Mike] Hey.

27:49.959 --> 27:51.086
Whoa.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.545
Nadia, where are you going?

27:53.338 --> 27:54.172
Hey!

27:59.344 --> 28:02.430
It's wild how they don't hit you
when you look both ways, huh?

28:12.941 --> 28:15.527

28:15.902 --> 28:17.737
