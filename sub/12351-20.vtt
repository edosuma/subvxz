WEBVTT

00:07.700 --> 00:08.634
I brought it up with Cappie.

00:08.669 --> 00:09.769
Well, you have to
live your own life.

00:09.803 --> 00:11.837
You have to go after what you want

00:11.872 --> 00:12.939
and not worry about him.

00:12.973 --> 00:14.607
I'm just not sure I'm
ready to graduate.

00:14.641 --> 00:16.042
So what about you and Casey?

00:16.076 --> 00:17.977
If she gets into CRU Law,
then it won't be an issue.

00:18.011 --> 00:19.812
- And if she doesn't?
- I don't really know.

00:19.846 --> 00:21.380
I'm sorry I tried to change you.

00:21.415 --> 00:24.116
- What about graduation?
- We'll worry about that in May.

00:24.151 --> 00:25.551
[Rusty] Dana inspires me.

00:25.586 --> 00:27.954
Do you need to talk to
me about anything else?

00:27.988 --> 00:29.822
I've been thinking.
I enjoy our time together,

00:29.856 --> 00:30.990
but I don'twant.

00:31.925 --> 00:34.026
No. Sorry.

00:34.061 --> 00:35.561
[Rusty] Why won't you tell
me your plan for revenge?

00:35.596 --> 00:37.997
- Because there isn't one.
- You didn't think I could help you.

00:38.031 --> 00:40.666
But I also know if I have a problem,
I can come to you.

00:40.701 --> 00:42.201
I just wish you felt the same.

00:42.236 --> 00:46.072
Ladies and gentlemen,
as president, it is my job

00:46.106 --> 00:48.841
to nominate the one man who
can lead us to victory.

00:48.875 --> 00:51.944
And our new Revenge Chair:
Rusty Cartwright!

00:53.480 --> 00:58.417
Phase One is complete.
Phase Two: Myrtle Beach.

00:59.186 --> 01:00.987
[exhaling]

01:01.021 --> 01:04.523
After years of pranks and brawls
and pledge paddles, this is it.

01:04.558 --> 01:08.361
Revenge on Omega Chi has
never looked so sweet.

01:11.131 --> 01:12.298
And fun!

01:12.332 --> 01:15.368
The first phase of Mission:
Probable is complete.

01:15.402 --> 01:18.738
The next three are ready and
waiting in Myrtle Beach.

01:18.772 --> 01:20.640
You might have to do
some of this without me.

01:20.674 --> 01:23.342
I have a secret mission of
my own involving your sister.

01:23.377 --> 01:26.312
- [chuckling]
- Beav!

01:26.346 --> 01:28.781
And put Evan Chambers down.
What are you doing?

01:30.017 --> 01:31.951
Are you talking about
Casey's birthday?

01:31.985 --> 01:34.186
I thought you were cc'ed
on her gift wish list.

01:34.221 --> 01:37.056
No, I'm pretty sure this is
something she won't be expecting.

01:39.226 --> 01:41.327
No way!

01:43.830 --> 01:46.132
Wait, is that the same
lavaliere that Beaver...

01:46.166 --> 01:48.401
Don't ask questions.
You don't want to know.

01:48.435 --> 01:51.504
This is Casey's last spring break.
I'm gonna get this right.

01:51.538 --> 01:54.140
Find the perfect moment.

01:55.776 --> 01:58.511
Cap... you know, if this works,

01:58.545 --> 02:01.280
we're never gonna have to worry
about the Omega Chis again.

02:01.315 --> 02:03.182
That's the plan.

02:03.216 --> 02:06.485
[Beaver simulating
explosion] Mini-car!

02:07.587 --> 02:09.855
You're going down,
little Omega Chi pony!

02:09.890 --> 02:11.057
B Team, rappel!

02:12.759 --> 02:14.860
Boot stomps!

02:20.500 --> 02:23.936
Well, that makes my sixth
interview this week!

02:23.970 --> 02:27.573
After graduation, I'm just gonna
have to live off the land.

02:27.607 --> 02:30.042
- Whatever thameans.
- It went well?

02:30.077 --> 02:32.345
If you ask me what
my weaknesses are,

02:32.379 --> 02:33.512
I'm gonna tell you!

02:33.547 --> 02:35.915
Punctuality's overrated anyway.

02:35.949 --> 02:39.585
Fortunately, we have spring break to
delight and maybe even surprise us.

02:39.619 --> 02:42.655
And take our minds off of all
this post-grad craziness.

02:42.689 --> 02:44.590
By post-grad craziness,
are you referring to the fact

02:44.624 --> 02:46.625
that you're both insanely
checking your e-mail

02:46.660 --> 02:48.694
for law school responses?

02:48.729 --> 02:53.332
So f f far I've been rejected m Stanford,
Georgetown and Texas.

02:53.367 --> 02:55.401
I feel like Laura at a mixer.

02:55.435 --> 02:57.002
Well, you still have
George Washington...

02:57.037 --> 02:58.304
And CRU.

02:58.338 --> 03:00.339
I just want to know already.

03:01.475 --> 03:03.909
You know, we did get
some mail earlier today.

03:03.944 --> 03:06.712
What? Where is it? Where is it at?

03:06.747 --> 03:10.316
They say you can tell a lot about
whether you were accepted or not

03:10.350 --> 03:12.852
- by the size of the envelope.
- Oh, my gosh, I can't look!

03:12.886 --> 03:14.387
Like what they say about
guys and their feet.

03:14.421 --> 03:16.288
That's a myth!
And where's the damn mail?

03:17.657 --> 03:19.458
- Oh, it's big.
- [gasping]

03:19.493 --> 03:22.294
It's big. It's really big.

03:22.329 --> 03:23.429
- [laughing]
- [Cappie] Read it.

03:23.463 --> 03:24.497
Open it! Open it!

03:27.534 --> 03:31.570
Oh, my God, I got into GW Law
School in Washington, DC!

03:31.605 --> 03:35.007
- [both laughing]
- Yay! That's awesome!

03:35.041 --> 03:37.543
I know! Oh, my God.

03:37.577 --> 03:40.045
Oh, my God,
this is really happening.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.380
Yeah, it's really happening.

03:41.415 --> 03:43.115
And you know they
really did admit you

03:43.150 --> 03:46.018
because George Washington
University cannot tell a lie.

03:46.787 --> 03:47.787
Um...

03:49.723 --> 03:51.891
Ash, did you get any mail from CRU?

03:51.925 --> 03:54.293
- No.
- Not yet, right?

03:55.162 --> 03:56.228
Right.

03:59.366 --> 04:01.400
[computer keys clacking]

04:09.076 --> 04:11.344
...and since the KTs
were gracious enough

04:11.378 --> 04:14.480
to suck at golf last week,
I'm proud to say we have

04:14.514 --> 04:16.249
a si party house in Myrtle Beach!

04:16.283 --> 04:18.684
[all cheering]

04:18.719 --> 04:21.887
It's on the Strand, wet bar, hot tub.
It's gonna be awesome!

04:21.922 --> 04:25.024
All right, all right,
but not too awesome, guys.

04:25.058 --> 04:28.194
I got a letter from Nationals,
they're seriously cracking down this year.

04:28.228 --> 04:31.697
"Given several incidents involving
illegal or untoward behavior

04:31.732 --> 04:33.566
by some chapters last spring break,

04:33.600 --> 04:35.401
members involved in
any illegal activity

04:35.435 --> 04:39.405
will risk immediate suspension and
the revocation of their charter."

04:39.439 --> 04:42.775
Well, there goes our South
Carolinian prostitution ring.

04:42.809 --> 04:43.909
[all laughing]

04:43.944 --> 04:46.279
All right, next up, house elections

04:46.313 --> 04:48.047
are after we return
from spring break,

04:48.081 --> 04:51.217
so I'll now open the floor
to presidential nominations.

04:51.251 --> 04:54.320
- JP?
- I nominate Trip Sutcliffe.

04:54.354 --> 04:56.555
[all applauding]

04:56.590 --> 05:00.326
Well, I graciously and humbly
accept this nomination.

05:01.762 --> 05:03.863
I would like to
nominate Calvin Owens.

05:05.432 --> 05:07.733
- Me?
- Shocker.

05:07.768 --> 05:10.770
Even though we broke up,
I still appreciate his integrity

05:10.804 --> 05:13.539
and I would love to see
him lead this house.

05:13.573 --> 05:15.641
Thanks, Grant.

05:15.676 --> 05:18.110
[Evan] Uh, great.
Any other nominations?

05:19.479 --> 05:22.348
All right, campaign
season will commence

05:22.382 --> 05:25.885
after Spring Break for
Sutcliffe versus Owens.

05:25.919 --> 05:27.153
Meeting adjourned.

05:28.822 --> 05:30.823
So that was pretty
cool of Grant, huh?

05:30.857 --> 05:33.192
Yeah, I'm glad to see you
guys are staying friends.

05:34.695 --> 05:37.930
I'm not sure he did you a favor,
though. - What do you mean?

05:37.964 --> 05:40.933
You know what I've been through
with this house, these guys.

05:40.967 --> 05:42.501
How much of a jerk I've had to be.

05:42.536 --> 05:46.505
I'm just no sure this is a
job you're wired to handle.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.074
Or even really want.

05:50.010 --> 05:52.445
[Dana] Wow, I've never been
to Myrtle Beach before.

05:52.479 --> 05:55.014
It's so great.
There's this club, Paradox.

05:55.048 --> 05:57.616
Are they gonna stamp our hands or
give us one of those wristband things?

05:57.651 --> 06:00.186
Oh, I couldn't get in.
But the beach is so great.

06:00.220 --> 06:03.522
Provided you wear sun block,
which I didn't.

06:03.557 --> 06:06.992
Sounds... dangerous.

06:07.027 --> 06:10.096
Well, the truth is, I was
actually only there for one night.

06:10.130 --> 06:12.932
I ended up coming back
with Calvin and Dale.

06:12.966 --> 06:16.969
See, Calvin and I were kind of in a fight
because of the feud between our houses.

06:17.003 --> 06:19.305
Your houses sure fight a lot.

06:19.339 --> 06:21.807
Well, this spring break's
going to be different, right?

06:21.842 --> 06:24.210
There are a few things
I have to do for KT

06:24.244 --> 06:26.045
while I'm there,
but outside of that,

06:26.079 --> 06:28.347
it's gonna be all Dana-Rusty,
all the time.

06:28.382 --> 06:31.617
I can't wait. I was lucky to
get a room so last minute.

06:31.651 --> 06:36.455
Well... I know we've only been
going out a couple of weeks.

06:36.490 --> 06:38.858
And the way the economy is...

06:39.993 --> 06:41.327
We could share a room.

06:42.262 --> 06:43.729
To save money.

06:45.265 --> 06:47.600
Only if you want!
Because of the economy.

06:47.634 --> 06:48.934
And stuff.

06:51.004 --> 06:54.907
Um, I wouldn't mind...
saving a little money.

06:56.042 --> 06:59.912
That's great! 'Cause the
economy sucks, so...

07:01.081 --> 07:06.685
- ...we can be frugal. Together.
- [chuckling]

07:09.489 --> 07:12.124
Yes, sir. I completely see
the irony of asking you

07:12.159 --> 07:14.326
to do something illegal
regarding admissions to a school

07:14.361 --> 07:16.829
that teaches the law,
but if I did get into CRU Law,

07:16.863 --> 07:19.598
could you just, like,
cough or sniff or something?

07:19.633 --> 07:22.568
One cough yes,
two coughs no? Hello?

07:22.602 --> 07:24.770
[groans] Stupid laws.

07:24.805 --> 07:27.440
I have some good news.
I just got off the phone with Nationals

07:27.474 --> 07:29.608
and next year they're
requiring all houses employ

07:29.643 --> 07:32.111
- a full-time house mother.
- How's that good news?

07:32.145 --> 07:34.246
Well, I meant for us,
'cause we're graduating.

07:34.281 --> 07:36.415
- Mmm-hmm.
- I wish I was graduating.

07:36.450 --> 07:38.751
Trust me, little sis, you don't.

07:40.487 --> 07:41.921
[sighs] Oh, Abby...

07:41.955 --> 07:44.256
Where are we on Casey's
surprise birthday party?

07:44.291 --> 07:47.126
We're set! I reserved a
section at Tijuana Tony's.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.894
Big banner, lots of balloons,
pink ones.

07:48.929 --> 07:50.996
And make sure they have a
lemon drop waiting for her.

07:51.031 --> 07:53.699
- Then keep them coming.
- Right!

07:53.733 --> 07:57.970
What? Casey's as predictable
as a Katherine Heigl movie.

07:58.004 --> 08:00.239
So what's all this graduation talk?

08:00.273 --> 08:03.209
Just the thought of going
to spring break single?

08:03.243 --> 08:04.643
It's kinda sad.

08:04.678 --> 08:07.279
And kinda my second year doing it.

08:07.314 --> 08:08.614
Sorry.

08:08.648 --> 08:11.884
No, don't be. We can find
fun new guys together!

08:11.918 --> 08:13.819
I'm kinda missing my lame old one.

08:13.854 --> 08:16.489
OK, we need to shake
this Evan Chambers thing.

08:16.523 --> 08:18.224
You know what we could do?

08:18.258 --> 08:20.559
We could take a
vacation from ourselves.

08:20.594 --> 08:22.628
Can we go somewhere
better than Myrtle Beach?

08:22.662 --> 08:25.097
No, but we can lie
about who we are.

08:25.131 --> 08:26.932
I used to do it all the
time on family vacations.

08:26.967 --> 08:28.567
On one trip to San Francisco,

08:28.602 --> 08:30.870
I told this waiter I was
a teen prodigy in town

08:30.904 --> 08:33.172
to play the cello for
Tony Blair and Oprah.

08:33.206 --> 08:35.975
And I got free dessert.
It was awesome.

08:37.811 --> 08:38.878
Trust me.

08:41.982 --> 08:44.383
Hey, you heading back down
to Sin in the Sand Land?

08:44.417 --> 08:46.819
Yeah. I thought you were
going turkey-hunting again.

08:46.853 --> 08:50.356
I thought I'd do something a little
different. Maybe hang out by the pool, get
some sun.

08:50.390 --> 08:53.826
It's too bad you don't want
to go to Sin in the Sand Land.

08:55.161 --> 08:56.829
I wouldn't say no.

08:58.265 --> 09:00.466
You just called it "
Sin in the Sand Land."

09:00.500 --> 09:01.500
Why would you want to go?

09:01.535 --> 09:03.569
For the sand. If I were invited.

09:03.603 --> 09:07.172
Well, my room is
going to be occupied.

09:08.909 --> 09:11.944
But I do know someone else
who has an extra room.

09:11.978 --> 09:15.147
- I can call her and see if...
- Is that an invitation?

09:15.181 --> 09:18.217
Dale, do you want to go to
Myrtle Beach with me and Dana?

09:18.251 --> 09:20.319
- Dana's going?
- I'm sure she won't mind.

09:20.353 --> 09:22.555
No, I just find her really grating.

09:23.390 --> 09:24.690
Let me think about it.

09:26.326 --> 09:28.494
All right, yeah,
I'll pack my floaties.

09:28.528 --> 09:32.197
[rock music plays]

09:32.232 --> 09:34.066
<i>* Show me the sun *</i>

09:34.100 --> 09:37.603
Hey! You're wasting valuable
party time, Case! Let's go!

09:37.637 --> 09:39.905
Hold on, guys. Hi, um... Hi.

09:39.940 --> 09:41.507
Do you have any mail
for Casey Cartwright?

09:41.541 --> 09:45.110
I'm her. I mean, I'm she.
She's me. I'm me. Hi.

09:45.145 --> 09:47.513
Hi. I can't deliver
mail to strangers.

09:47.547 --> 09:49.415
You're going to have to wait
until I get to your house.

09:49.449 --> 09:52.051
This might be my last spring break.
With my boyfriend.

09:52.085 --> 09:53.919
Because we're going down
two different life paths.

09:53.954 --> 09:55.554
Unless I get into CRU Law School.

09:55.589 --> 09:58.157
Law school? So you
know it's illegal...

09:58.191 --> 10:00.593
Yeah, irony, got it.

10:00.627 --> 10:03.262
Regardless, if I get into CRU,
that'd buy us a few more years.

10:03.296 --> 10:05.564
If I don't, then have to accept
that this is a college thing,

10:05.599 --> 10:06.732
and we'll have to go
our separate ways.

10:06.766 --> 10:09.401
- I deliver mail for a living.
- I'll pay you.

10:09.436 --> 10:13.839
Also illegal. You know what?
Never mind, here.

10:13.873 --> 10:15.674
I'll give you a trick of the trade.

10:15.709 --> 10:17.676
You can tell whether you
were accepted or not

10:17.711 --> 10:19.645
by the size of the envelope.

10:19.679 --> 10:25.618
- Oh, CRU Law, right? Sorry.
- Thanks.

[bus engine turning over]

10:41.935 --> 10:46.772
- Oh, so... anything from CRU?
- Just this underwear catalog.

10:46.806 --> 10:49.908
- Oh, can I have it?
- We've talked about this, Beav.

10:51.277 --> 10:53.012
Casey Cartwright,
this is gonna be a spring break

10:53.046 --> 10:55.314
- you'll never forget.
- I think so.

10:57.350 --> 11:02.721
- [engine starts]
- [cheering]

11:12.924 --> 11:16.493
<i>* Young scholars young lovers *</i>

11:16.527 --> 11:18.196
Wow, it's as God-awful
as I'd imagined.

11:19.230 --> 11:21.966
You know, Dale, I really wish
I hadn't cancelled that room.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.201
Oh, I don't mind
staying with you two.

11:28.606 --> 11:32.443
Hmm. There's gotta be a
Hide-A-Bed or something.

11:32.477 --> 11:33.877
Where's it hiding?

11:39.250 --> 11:41.051
Sorry, Dana.

11:41.085 --> 11:44.054
It's OK. I just thought
we were gonna...

11:44.088 --> 11:45.622
...save a little money.

11:45.657 --> 11:47.991
We are. We're doing
this three ways, right?

11:48.026 --> 11:50.694
No! Not in the way you're thinking.

11:51.996 --> 11:54.131
But there can still
be some savings.

11:54.165 --> 11:56.733
We can save some money elsewhere.

11:56.768 --> 11:59.570
I brought coupons,
for your pleasure.

11:59.604 --> 12:01.638
Stone Phillips says a black
light is the best way

12:01.673 --> 12:04.241
to check for residual...
protein matter.

12:07.979 --> 12:09.680
- Oh!
- There it is.

12:09.714 --> 12:12.683
Looks like someone saved
money all over the room.

12:12.717 --> 12:13.984
On the phone?

12:18.256 --> 12:21.658
- I call the floor.
- Guess we get the bed.

12:27.065 --> 12:28.632
Did you guys see the
hot tub out back?

12:28.666 --> 12:31.468
<i>This place is better than the
house on Jersey Shore.</i>

12:31.503 --> 12:33.904
And with fewer
hair-gelled fame-whores.

12:33.938 --> 12:36.039
Yeah. I can't believe we
lucked out with this place.

12:36.074 --> 12:38.342
I can't believe the KTs
lucked into this place.

12:38.376 --> 12:42.179
Hey. What the hell
are you doing here?

12:42.213 --> 12:44.014
This is my boss's house.

12:44.048 --> 12:47.017
Uh, I think there's
been a misunderstanding.

12:47.051 --> 12:48.652
No, freakin' kidding!

12:48.686 --> 12:50.921
This is our house, actually.
We rented it for the week.

12:50.955 --> 12:52.656
No, these guys we know rented it.

12:52.690 --> 12:55.125
What are you, stupid or something?

12:55.159 --> 12:58.028
You got exactly ten seconds
to get off this property.

12:58.062 --> 12:59.796
Or what?

13:02.300 --> 13:07.771
Oh! OK. Um, sir,
we apologize to you.

13:07.805 --> 13:10.641
And we don't want any trouble
so we will be leaving now.

13:10.675 --> 13:13.277
Take these items, please,
as a gift, and uh...

13:14.078 --> 13:15.512
Sorry.

13:18.716 --> 13:21.585
It's a set-up. Kappa Taus wanted
us to win that tournament.

13:21.619 --> 13:24.421
- Well, now we're homeless.
- Guess we kinda had it coming.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.423
Had it coming? Let's serve it back.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.692
Let's find a place
to stay first, Trip.

13:34.699 --> 13:35.999
Phase two is complete.

13:36.935 --> 13:39.703
[dance music playing]

13:42.574 --> 13:47.277
So that's it. I guess I'm leaving
Cyprus and leaving Cappie.

13:48.780 --> 13:50.414
I'm sorry.

13:50.448 --> 13:53.216
But I thought you'd
accepted your relationship

13:53.251 --> 13:55.519
with Cappie would end
after graduation.

13:55.553 --> 13:59.056
I did, but that's when
everything was... theoretical.

13:59.090 --> 14:03.093
- And now it's retical.
- Exactly. I'm gonna be 22!

14:03.127 --> 14:05.562
Do you know who's 22? Old people.

14:05.597 --> 14:09.700
But do old people
bungee jump? [giggles]

14:09.734 --> 14:11.668
Come on, it's our last spring break

14:11.703 --> 14:13.637
and I'm not going to let you
angst your way through it.

14:15.173 --> 14:20.110
- I am gonna miss you, though.
- I'm gonna miss you, too!

14:21.179 --> 14:23.714
[both laughing]

14:26.050 --> 14:29.152
How could I not have
gotten into CRU?

14:29.187 --> 14:30.520
I mean, that was my safety school!

14:30.555 --> 14:32.889
GW Law was sort of a long shot.

14:32.924 --> 14:36.893
You got into law school?
Congrats! I went to Georgetown.

14:36.928 --> 14:39.630
Really? Any advice?

14:39.664 --> 14:42.165
Yeah, it's, uh... It's really hard.

14:43.801 --> 14:45.302
Don't flunk out.

14:50.408 --> 14:53.377
Who wants shots from
the Margarito Bandito?

14:53.945 --> 14:55.779
[all cheering]

14:57.482 --> 15:00.917
- You want a shot?
- Uh, God, yes! Please!

15:03.888 --> 15:05.922
- Here, here, here!
- [laughing]

15:05.957 --> 15:08.125
- OK...
- [yelling]

15:08.159 --> 15:09.593

15:09.627 --> 15:12.629
Wow, my first fake ID.
I can't believe it worked.

15:12.664 --> 15:14.031
Thank you, "Chad Stewart."

15:14.065 --> 15:16.533
Don't thank me, "Penelope Holmes."

15:16.567 --> 15:17.801
Thank Kappa Tau.

15:17.835 --> 15:22.673
What's the matter, Francis Domingo?

15:22.707 --> 15:24.708
[rap music plays]

15:24.742 --> 15:27.010
Well, I might try the bar. Um...

15:27.045 --> 15:28.145
What should get?

15:28.179 --> 15:31.915
"Sex on the Beach.
Sex in the Water.

15:31.949 --> 15:34.885
Sex Wading in the Water but
Planning to Come Back to the Beach."

15:34.919 --> 15:36.119
What do you think, Rusty?

15:37.288 --> 15:40.390
Just get anything you want.

15:40.425 --> 15:42.059
You know, with drink
names like that,

15:42.093 --> 15:44.995
they're practically promoting
unwanted pregnancies.

15:45.029 --> 15:48.131
You won't have to worry about that.

15:48.166 --> 15:49.599
You won't have to worry about that.

15:49.634 --> 15:51.968
- Now that I'm sharing the room.
- Thanks, Francis.

15:52.003 --> 15:53.203
Thank you.

15:56.074 --> 15:58.208
Hey, I'm Taylor.

15:58.242 --> 16:00.444
I'm a dancer from
Portland who loves pugs,

16:00.478 --> 16:03.680
moody floral prints and the
music of Muse. And you are?

16:03.715 --> 16:07.451
- Julia.
- OK, well that's a start.

16:07.485 --> 16:12.556
So who are Julia and
Taylor going to meet first?

16:15.259 --> 16:16.893
I think you got one, Taylor.

16:21.599 --> 16:23.600
I'm gonna go in for a closer look.

16:27.438 --> 16:31.074
Hi! I'm Taylor.
I'm a dancer from Portland.

16:31.109 --> 16:32.709
I love your top.

16:32.744 --> 16:35.679
It seems leopard print's
really making a comeback.

16:35.713 --> 16:38.148
OK... thanks.

16:38.182 --> 16:41.685
You know, I have this friend who
just broke up with his boyfriend.

16:41.719 --> 16:43.920
- I could call him.
- Ooh.

16:43.955 --> 16:44.921
Um, hi?

16:44.956 --> 16:47.591
Sorry, cutie.
This is just business.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.726
We come down here every
year to observe trends,

16:49.761 --> 16:51.194
check out the young people.

16:51.229 --> 16:54.131
I like your look.
I'm Faith Flowers.

16:54.165 --> 16:56.666
Well, Faith Flowers,
let me be clear.

16:56.701 --> 16:59.035
I'm not interested in porn,

16:59.070 --> 17:01.872
or lifting my top or
making out with a girl.

17:01.906 --> 17:03.640
Shame on you.

17:08.646 --> 17:10.213
Was that Faith Flowers?

17:10.248 --> 17:12.249
I didn't know you watched porn.

17:12.283 --> 17:14.718
No, Faith Flowers is
a trend forecaster.

17:14.752 --> 17:17.420
My father hired her as a
consultant back in the day.

17:17.455 --> 17:19.556
Companies pay her to tell them
what the latest trends are.

17:19.590 --> 17:22.259
Wait, that's a real job?

17:22.293 --> 17:25.395
I'd be so good at that!
It's like being cool and psychic!

17:25.429 --> 17:27.330
Do something about it.

17:27.365 --> 17:29.232
What? Just go up to her
and beg her for a job?

17:29.267 --> 17:34.704
- She's right there...
- Oh, no! She was right there.

17:35.506 --> 17:37.274
It's like she's magic.

17:38.476 --> 17:41.678
No. She's the Fairy Job Mother.

17:44.649 --> 17:47.017
OK, look, we already
have a hotel, all right?

17:47.051 --> 17:49.319
So let's put everything
behind us and have some fun.

17:49.353 --> 17:51.555
Hi, guys. How's the house?

17:51.589 --> 17:53.690
We sure are pissed
we lost it. [groans]

17:53.724 --> 17:57.294
Yeah. That house belongs to
someone else. Someone armed.

17:57.328 --> 17:59.930
And since it's spring break,
now we're stuck in a crap hotel.

18:01.299 --> 18:04.034
- Sorry to hear about that, Cal.
- Thanks, Heath.

18:04.068 --> 18:06.269
Heath meant that sarcastically,
by the way.

18:08.005 --> 18:11.208
When you guys are trying to
sleep in your crappy hotel,

18:11.242 --> 18:14.344
I hope you dream of Jeremy,
Ferret and Wade.

18:14.378 --> 18:16.079
Aw, you're still
whining about that?

18:16.113 --> 18:18.782
For the last time, we didn't
mean for them to get expelled.

18:18.816 --> 18:22.419
Then I didn't mean to sleep
with your girlfriend, Bing.

18:22.453 --> 18:25.488
- Oh, wait, yes I did.
- Ooh!

18:27.191 --> 18:29.259
Everyone remember
what Nationals said.

18:29.293 --> 18:33.964
All right, hey, hey...
Happy spring break, Evan Pompeo!

18:33.998 --> 18:36.333
<i>Of Grey's Anatomy fame!</i>

18:47.011 --> 18:50.680
Abby! How's your first
college spring break so far?

18:50.715 --> 18:52.349
I never want to leave!

18:52.383 --> 18:55.285
I heard about GW,
that's so exciting!

18:55.319 --> 18:58.588
- Yeah, really exciting.
- Where are you going to live?

18:58.623 --> 19:00.857
I haven't thought about it.

19:00.892 --> 19:02.292
Are you going to get a roommate?

19:02.326 --> 19:03.994
I'm not sure.

19:04.028 --> 19:06.296
- Do you even know anyone there?
- No.

19:06.330 --> 19:09.366
You're probably not going to have
a whole lot of time to socialize.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.167
I bet law school is super hard.

19:11.202 --> 19:12.669
Are you ready for it?

19:18.376 --> 19:21.344
You know what, Abby? Um,
I don't know.

19:21.379 --> 19:24.080
I'm not even 100
percent sure I'm going.

19:24.115 --> 19:28.518
I mean, I could just stay
in Cyprus for another year.

19:28.552 --> 19:31.054
Maybe take that
housemother job at ZBZ.

19:31.088 --> 19:33.056
You should totally stay!

19:33.858 --> 19:34.858
Yeah...

19:37.862 --> 19:38.929
Right?

19:49.632 --> 19:50.899
My parents say hi.

19:50.933 --> 19:52.968
They can't sleep at night
knowing I'm down here.

19:53.802 --> 19:57.538
Their only comfort is knowing
I'm below the Mason-Dixon line.

19:57.573 --> 19:58.973
So what should we do today?

19:59.007 --> 20:00.775
I was thinking you could
do your own thing today.

20:00.809 --> 20:03.578
But I'm not sure how
much fun I can have alone

20:03.612 --> 20:06.113
on a plantation tour.
Why don't you guys come with me?

20:06.148 --> 20:08.583
Dana and I had kinda had
some romantic time planned.

20:08.617 --> 20:11.285
What's more romantic than taking
in the architectural detail

20:11.320 --> 20:13.087
of two-century-old
slaves' quarters?

20:13.121 --> 20:15.323
I read online that girls love them.

20:15.357 --> 20:18.926
Listen, I appreciate you coming
all this way to spend spring break

20:18.961 --> 20:20.528
because you wanted to
spend time with me...

20:20.562 --> 20:21.662
I didn't come for you.

20:21.697 --> 20:24.165
Do you think I enjoy
being your third wheel!?

20:25.601 --> 20:26.667
Then why are you here?

20:27.970 --> 20:30.104
Forget it, have fun
with your girlfriend.

20:36.445 --> 20:40.181
- Is Francis OK?
- I have no idea.

20:40.215 --> 20:44.685
You know, we're alone.
Do you want to save some money?

20:45.520 --> 20:47.221
Oh!

20:48.423 --> 20:50.491
Crap! I've got this
KT stuff I gotta do.

20:50.525 --> 20:52.393
It's Phase Three,
but I'll be right back.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.329
I will wait here.

20:55.364 --> 21:00.668
- [muffled vomiting]
- Or I'll go to the beach.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.333
Uh, Casey, wake up.

21:32.367 --> 21:34.302
Wake up, Casey,
hurry! Hurry, wake up!

21:34.336 --> 21:36.771
Casey... Aww!

21:38.240 --> 21:40.841
- Happy birthday!
- Oh...

21:40.876 --> 21:42.476
That's so nice.

21:44.079 --> 21:48.749
Oh, ow! Oh, my gosh,
I am so hung over.

21:48.784 --> 21:50.551
Yeah.

21:50.585 --> 21:52.920
- How are you not?
- Practice.

21:52.955 --> 21:56.223
You were the life of the
party last night. - [groaning]

21:56.258 --> 21:59.360
I think, at one point,
you put a lamp shade on your head.

22:00.495 --> 22:04.999
- You were so cute and cliche.
- It was fun.

22:05.033 --> 22:07.468
Thanks for the... cruller.

22:07.502 --> 22:09.570
Um, I actually had
something else...

22:09.604 --> 22:11.706
I didn't get into CRU.

22:12.808 --> 22:13.941
Oh.

22:15.143 --> 22:18.212
Oh, I'm sorry, Case.

22:18.246 --> 22:22.249
But, I've been thinking. About us.

22:22.284 --> 22:26.354
And my life in Cyprus
and the sorority.

22:26.388 --> 22:29.290
And I have decided... to stay.

22:29.324 --> 22:33.294
I can defer GW for a year.
Maybe even two.

22:33.328 --> 22:34.862
You're not still drunk, are you?

22:34.896 --> 22:37.398
I've even been thinking about

22:37.432 --> 22:40.668
taking up the house
mother position at ZBZ.

22:43.772 --> 22:48.776
I love my life at ZBZ,
and I love you.

22:48.810 --> 22:50.344
Why would I leave?

22:54.816 --> 22:57.251
Yay!

22:57.285 --> 22:59.320
So, do you know what I
feel like doing right now?

22:59.354 --> 23:01.222
Oh, I hope so.

23:01.256 --> 23:03.524
Stop it. I'm gonna
get some clothes on.

23:03.558 --> 23:04.625
- Let's go.
- OK.

23:08.030 --> 23:10.731
[Ashleigh] Well, nothing on
the Fairy Job Mother so far.

23:10.766 --> 23:13.300
How are you doing on
boy patrol, "Julia?"

23:13.335 --> 23:14.935
[Rebecca] None so far.

23:14.970 --> 23:18.806
Ugh! You're on vacation from
yourself! Look for boys.

23:18.840 --> 23:22.309
I can't vacate. I miss Evan, OK?

23:22.344 --> 23:25.413
[sighs] So are you going
to do something about it?

23:25.447 --> 23:28.916
Right. Just pour my heart out and
plead for him to take me back.

23:31.053 --> 23:33.320
He's right over there.

23:36.792 --> 23:40.161
Just open up myself to him and
possibly have him shut me down?

23:40.195 --> 23:42.463
You and I have had
our set of issues.

23:42.497 --> 23:46.233
If I can forgive you,
maybe he can too.

23:49.037 --> 23:51.872
Can you give me a minute?
Guys? I'll meet up with you.

23:58.880 --> 24:02.283
- [laughs nervously] Hi.
- Hi.

24:04.920 --> 24:08.856
Wow, um... Here's the thing.

24:08.890 --> 24:10.858
I'm just gonna get to the point.

24:12.294 --> 24:15.296
I screwed up... big time.

24:15.330 --> 24:18.265
I hurt you. And I'm sorry for that.

24:19.367 --> 24:20.868
I still care about you.

24:22.637 --> 24:24.572
A lot, actually.

24:27.709 --> 24:28.909
And I miss you.

24:31.713 --> 24:33.581
And I would appreciate
a second chance.

24:39.221 --> 24:40.321
I can't.

24:42.290 --> 24:45.292
I appreciate your apology, Rebecca.

24:45.327 --> 24:49.663
And I can forgive, but I'm
honestly not sure I can forget.

24:49.698 --> 24:51.532
Or if I even really want to.

24:51.566 --> 24:53.701
I'm still pissed.

24:55.437 --> 24:57.238
I'm sorry.

24:58.373 --> 24:59.573
So then...

25:01.209 --> 25:02.476
...there it is.

25:18.960 --> 25:22.930
Wow. You can see a lot up here.

25:22.964 --> 25:24.832
You can practically see forever.

25:24.866 --> 25:27.301
- Speaking of forever...
- [whimpering]

25:28.570 --> 25:31.372
- Case...
- [gasping]

25:31.406 --> 25:33.807
If you're gonna puke I'd
throw it more that direction.

25:33.842 --> 25:36.343
I think I see some
Omega Chis down there.

25:36.378 --> 25:40.080
I'm... I'm OK,
um... Why don't you go first?

25:40.115 --> 25:42.449
I thought you wanted to do this.
Are you scared?

25:42.484 --> 25:45.352
I'm not scared. It's just...

25:45.387 --> 25:49.890
- What if the cord breaks?
- That never happens. Does it?

25:49.925 --> 25:52.193
- Nah.
- Nah, never happens.

25:52.227 --> 25:55.296
OK, well, what if it's calibrated
wrong and I hit the ground

25:55.330 --> 25:56.697
and I bounce back up
and hit the platform

25:56.731 --> 25:57.898
and then I hit the ground again?

25:57.933 --> 25:59.433
Seems a little Wile E Coyote.

25:59.467 --> 26:02.036
There's some basis in
real physics there.

26:02.070 --> 26:04.572
I think that's just the
fear talking, Case.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.607
So what if it is fear?
Fear's natural.

26:06.641 --> 26:09.610
It's good. It keeps you
from making mistakes.

26:09.644 --> 26:12.279
Doing things that
you're not ready for.

26:12.314 --> 26:15.182
Not when it keeps you
from living your life.

26:15.217 --> 26:18.786
- Having fun.
- I just don't want to do it.

26:18.820 --> 26:21.989
So I'm going to crawl back down.
I'll see you on the ground.

26:22.023 --> 26:24.124
Not if I see you first.

26:24.759 --> 26:27.795
[whooping]

26:27.829 --> 26:31.599
So, I ran into Rebecca earlier.
She apologized.

26:31.633 --> 26:35.236
- Wanted to get back together.
- And?

26:35.270 --> 26:38.172
I said no. I mean, are you kidding?

26:38.206 --> 26:40.107
You know you still like her, Evan.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.642
Why don't you give
her another chance?

26:41.676 --> 26:45.479
Because then if I get burned again,
I'm the fool.

26:45.513 --> 26:48.282
No thank you.
See, Cal, you're too nice.

26:48.316 --> 26:51.218
Uh, guys What the hell?

26:55.156 --> 26:56.457
Is that the guy from the house?

26:56.491 --> 26:59.526
And isn't that your little
KT buddy paying him, Owens?

27:06.568 --> 27:12.940
- Buying some guns, Cartwright?
- Who? What?

27:12.974 --> 27:15.643
That guy? I've never
seen that guy before.

27:15.677 --> 27:19.246
You hired that guy to kick
us out of that beach house.

27:21.483 --> 27:24.685
Joke's over. You got me.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.455
- I must be going now.
- Hey, hey...

27:29.457 --> 27:30.491
No problems.

27:31.793 --> 27:35.029
So, if that wasn't his house,
who's staying there now?

27:35.063 --> 27:38.632
- Uh... nobody?
- Nobody? All right.

27:38.667 --> 27:40.668
Then we're taking back our house.

27:51.515 --> 27:54.116
OK, all right! Everybody listen up!

27:54.151 --> 27:56.219
We should toast the Omega Chis

27:56.354 --> 27:58.588
for making this spring
break memorable.

27:58.623 --> 28:02.525
- Cheers!
- [all cheering]

28:06.030 --> 28:09.933
Uh, Spitter. We said you could
invite one friend from school.

28:09.967 --> 28:12.602
Cap, I'm sorry,
they caught me paying off Roy.

28:12.637 --> 28:16.339
Listen, we're taking back this house.
We won it fair and square. So get out.

28:16.374 --> 28:18.441
We're not leaving, Chambers.
You lied to me.

28:18.476 --> 28:20.176
You got three of our
brothers expelled.

28:20.211 --> 28:22.579
Leave us the house,
we'll call it even. - No way, Cap.

28:22.613 --> 28:25.949
If you want us gone,
then you're going to have to kill us.

28:25.983 --> 28:30.854
"Kill"? What am I
walking into here, boys?

28:32.256 --> 28:35.925
Officer. Everything's fine.
We're gonna turn the music down.

28:35.960 --> 28:38.094
And, uh... these guys
were just leaving.

28:38.129 --> 28:40.930
- Who's house is this?
- It's ours.

28:40.965 --> 28:43.233
Yep. It's theirs.

28:43.267 --> 28:45.568
You heard the man.
We were just leaving.

28:45.603 --> 28:47.003
Come on, KTs! Let's go!

28:51.609 --> 28:53.877
[donkey braying]

28:56.947 --> 28:59.449
Cheese and crackers!
Is this your donkey, too?

28:59.483 --> 29:01.251
No, we've never seen that before.

29:01.285 --> 29:03.620
What else here isn't yours?

29:06.691 --> 29:10.060
Hey, who ordered the fat,
ugly strippers? - Dale?

29:10.094 --> 29:12.996
- What happened to the party?
- That's not ours either.

29:13.030 --> 29:15.932
Have you been drinking?
How old are you, son?

29:15.966 --> 29:20.670
- I am 21, you jackass.
- [donkey braying]

29:20.705 --> 29:24.741
<i>I got a card to prove it.
And that's Senor Domingo to you, jefe.</i>

29:24.775 --> 29:28.945
Yeah, uh, that's right.
You just look so young, Francis.

29:28.979 --> 29:30.747
Let's get you outta here.

29:30.781 --> 29:34.951
I'm shutting this party down!
Everyone go home!

29:34.985 --> 29:37.587
Except for you guys. It's your place.
I need to see your IDs.

29:37.621 --> 29:42.092
Officer, listen...
The fact is we just arrived.

29:42.126 --> 29:44.928
Any illegal activity has
nothing to do with us.

29:44.962 --> 29:47.230
And we're in a fraternity.

29:47.264 --> 29:50.400
If we get in any trouble like this,
we could lose our charter.

29:50.434 --> 29:53.837
Should've thought of that before
you involved that innocent donkey.

29:55.206 --> 29:56.806
All right, Cap.

29:58.943 --> 30:01.344
Come on, man, we could
lose our house. For real.

30:01.379 --> 30:04.347
Well, that's not what
we intended but, uh...

30:04.382 --> 30:06.149
Seems fitting, don't you think?

30:18.863 --> 30:24.667
- Hey, are you OK?
- What? Oh, yeah. Hi.

30:24.702 --> 30:28.371
- Do you want some company?
- Um... Why not?

30:28.406 --> 30:31.174
I guess I've already lost...

30:31.208 --> 30:33.777
Faith? Faith Flowers!

30:35.179 --> 30:38.982
Hi, It's... It's me! Ash... Taylor.

30:39.016 --> 30:41.284
Ashed Aylor? What a delicious name.

30:41.318 --> 30:44.521
Thank you! You can call
me Ashleigh for short.

30:44.555 --> 30:48.992
I just wanted to say I'm really
sorry about the porn thing.

30:49.026 --> 30:51.928
- What are you talking about?
- I'm the...

30:53.097 --> 30:56.332
...someone you don't know.
But you should.

30:56.367 --> 30:59.436
Um, I'm graduating from
CRU in about a month.

30:59.470 --> 31:02.739
I've interview for jobs ranging from
the assistant to the regional manager

31:02.773 --> 31:05.375
of blah, blah, blah to the junior
exec to the head of "Who Cares."

31:05.409 --> 31:08.578
I don't love any of that.
So I started to accept

31:08.612 --> 31:11.815
that I was gonna get a job I didn't love
because that's what people do, right?

31:11.849 --> 31:13.650
Until I met you.
Look at this dress.

31:13.684 --> 31:16.553
I made it out of a couple of really
old T-shirts and dresses I had,

31:16.587 --> 31:19.522
because, one, I'm in
college and poor, and, two,

31:19.557 --> 31:23.092
I didn't want to throw them out
and have them sit in a landfill.

31:23.127 --> 31:24.861
So deconstructed fashion, right?

31:24.895 --> 31:26.996
It's totally on the rise
because of the economy,

31:27.031 --> 31:30.066
and because of how green everyone's getting.
And I love realizing that.

31:30.100 --> 31:32.235
I love being able to imagine
what the next thing will be,

31:32.269 --> 31:34.537
not just in fashion,
but in everything.

31:34.572 --> 31:38.174
And the idea of being able to do that,
what I love, and get paid?

31:38.209 --> 31:41.511
That probably has to be the most
amazing thing anyone can do, right?

31:41.545 --> 31:44.981
So I guess, what I'm trying to say,
Fairy Job Mother,

31:45.015 --> 31:47.584
- is that I love you.
- I beg your pardon?

31:47.618 --> 31:50.153
I mean, I love what you do.

31:50.187 --> 31:54.324
And I would love to do what you do.
Or learn from you.

31:54.358 --> 31:57.627
Or get you coffee or whatever.

31:57.661 --> 32:00.663
So... what do you say?

32:02.333 --> 32:06.536
Did you guys witness any
activity with the donkey?

32:06.570 --> 32:10.340
Do something, Chambers.
They're going to shut our house down.

32:10.374 --> 32:12.709
What the hell do you
expect me to do, Trip?

32:12.743 --> 32:14.077
They caught us with
a freakin' donkey.

32:14.111 --> 32:16.312
Some president.

32:17.515 --> 32:18.715
Uh, officer?

32:18.749 --> 32:21.017
Uh, hey, Trip,
why don't you let it alone?

32:21.051 --> 32:22.585
At least he's doing something.

32:22.620 --> 32:26.723
Officer Nixon, we'd be happy
to make a sizable donation

32:26.757 --> 32:30.093
to your department if you were to look
the other way on this whole thing.

32:30.127 --> 32:33.563
Bribery, too?
Against the wall, Big Red!

32:33.597 --> 32:36.499
You boys are screwed.

32:37.935 --> 32:39.869
Um... Officer Nixon?

32:39.904 --> 32:42.672
Hi, uh, can we talk in private?

32:46.810 --> 32:49.679
[indistinct murmuring]

32:49.713 --> 32:51.114
I hope he doesn't screw this up.

32:51.148 --> 32:53.816
After Trip,
it can't get much worse.

32:55.586 --> 32:57.954
We're going to lose our
charter, aren't we?

33:02.326 --> 33:05.361
Thank you. Thank you so much.

33:07.598 --> 33:09.732
All right, guys. We're good here.

33:11.669 --> 33:13.770
Let's go get some pancakes.

33:17.508 --> 33:20.610
- What the hell did you do?
- I handled it. So let's get

33:20.644 --> 33:23.713
our stuff back in here and
resume our spring break!

33:23.747 --> 33:29.052
- [all cheering]
- Dude, you got my vote, Owens.

33:33.457 --> 33:36.793
Way to go, little bro.
Maybe you do have what it takes

33:36.827 --> 33:38.127
to become president of Omega Chi.

33:38.162 --> 33:40.830
Yeah, well, I learned from
the best. - Thanks, man.

33:40.864 --> 33:44.233
You've shown me how loyal
and generous someone can be.

33:46.136 --> 33:48.137
But you've also shown me how pride

33:48.172 --> 33:50.640
can really threaten to ruin a guy.

33:50.674 --> 33:55.144
It's not your family or your money,
Evan. It's your pride.

33:57.514 --> 33:59.682
You're gonna lose
Rebecca because of that.

34:04.555 --> 34:06.356
- [knocking on door]
- Hey.

34:06.390 --> 34:08.992
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

34:09.026 --> 34:13.429
I am getting ready for my
surprise birthday party.

34:13.464 --> 34:15.932
- How about you?
- Did Abby tell you?

34:15.966 --> 34:19.369
It's a sorority, Ash. Not the CIA.

34:19.403 --> 34:21.871
OK, good, because I have a
secret that I can't keep!

34:21.905 --> 34:24.641
I... got a job!

34:24.675 --> 34:27.543
It's not a job-job,
more of an unpaid internship

34:27.578 --> 34:31.447
with this woman, Faith Flowers.
She's a trend forecaster.

34:31.482 --> 34:33.282
What? That's perfect for you.

34:33.317 --> 34:36.953
I know! I'm going to New York!

34:36.987 --> 34:39.322
[both giggling]

34:39.356 --> 34:41.024
Oh, my God!

34:42.693 --> 34:45.128
It's really happening.

34:45.162 --> 34:47.497
Aren't you a little freaked out?

34:48.932 --> 34:51.100
No. I'm ready.

34:53.671 --> 34:57.473
Case, when I started CRU,
I thought I'd just get a degree,

34:57.508 --> 34:59.375
maybe get married.

34:59.410 --> 35:03.746
I never really thought I
wanted that much for myself.

35:04.982 --> 35:07.450
But then I met you,

35:07.484 --> 35:09.952
and because of you and
because of our friendship...

35:12.089 --> 35:15.525
...I've come to want more for myself
than I ever could've imagined.

35:17.695 --> 35:20.363
You always go after what you want,

35:20.397 --> 35:22.365
and I'll never forget that.

35:23.934 --> 35:26.969
You're my best friend
and you always will be.

35:28.605 --> 35:31.774
Even if I'm in New York
and you stay in Cyprus.

35:32.943 --> 35:33.876
Wait, you knew?

35:33.911 --> 35:36.779
Yeah, it's a sorority. Not the CIA.

35:36.814 --> 35:40.516
Maybe I'm not as strong
as you think I am.

35:40.551 --> 35:42.151
Yes, you are.

35:43.787 --> 35:46.489
Maybe you've just taken a
vacation from yourself.

35:51.729 --> 35:55.264
Oh, spinning! Stop the spinning!

35:55.299 --> 35:59.268
I'm so sorry. This is not
what I wanted it to be for us.

35:59.303 --> 36:02.605
It's OK. We can save
money back in Cyprus.

36:02.639 --> 36:06.375
Just say sex. Good lord,
I'm from the South, not France.

36:06.410 --> 36:08.211
Dale, where were you all day?

36:08.245 --> 36:10.980
This is your fault!
You're like weed.

36:11.014 --> 36:12.715
You're my gateway,
Rusty Cartwright!

36:12.750 --> 36:16.552
My fault? I didn't get you wasted.

36:16.587 --> 36:18.154
Why'd you really want to come here?

36:18.188 --> 36:20.490
[Dale] Well, not for the sand, OK?

36:21.992 --> 36:25.294
I wanted a girl.
And not a landlady.

36:25.329 --> 36:28.798
Or some sorority girl that's
too insecure to stick by me.

36:28.832 --> 36:32.502
I wanted to have a real college
experience like you did.

36:32.536 --> 36:34.570
And have fun.

36:36.473 --> 36:38.207
'Cause I only got two
years left to do it.

36:41.411 --> 36:44.647
Should we go get him some coffee,
or something?

36:46.416 --> 36:51.654
<i>You look like Aliens vs.
Predator, but all in one human form.</i>

36:51.688 --> 36:53.356
[knocking on door]

36:54.825 --> 36:58.094
- I need you.
- I need you, Casey.

37:00.164 --> 37:01.697
What's up?

37:01.732 --> 37:05.134
Uh6.. I got into law
school in Washington.

37:05.169 --> 37:06.536
That's great!

37:06.570 --> 37:08.204
It's not, because I'm not going.

37:08.238 --> 37:10.940
I now see why Cappie
doesn't want to graduate.

37:10.974 --> 37:13.810
What if I'm not ready,
Rusty? What if I fail?

37:13.844 --> 37:17.380
You're ready. There are bigger
things out there for you now.

37:19.149 --> 37:20.550
I'll be alone.

37:20.584 --> 37:22.418
Casey, remember when
I first came to CRU?

37:22.452 --> 37:24.620
I was terrified. I was lonely.

37:24.655 --> 37:26.122
I didn't have a world.

37:26.156 --> 37:27.857
But if I had never came here,

37:27.891 --> 37:31.460
I never would've
joined a fraternity.

37:31.495 --> 37:35.998
Met Cappie and all those guys.
Calvin and Dale.

37:36.033 --> 37:40.002
I never would've had the relationship
that I have with you now.

37:40.037 --> 37:42.271
Now I have a whole universe.

37:43.774 --> 37:45.074
<i>Did you ever read Peter Pan?</i>

37:45.108 --> 37:48.644
<i>No. See? I've never even
read Peter Pan!</i>

37:48.679 --> 37:50.413
I have no business leaving school.

37:50.447 --> 37:53.249
<i>- I have to stay.
- The first line of Peter Pan</i>

37:53.283 --> 37:56.352
is "All children,
except one, grow up."

37:56.386 --> 37:58.554
Wendy knew that at two years old.

37:58.589 --> 38:00.056
You're learning it at 22.

38:00.090 --> 38:02.859
Everyone has to grow up.
Nobody's Peter Pan.

38:04.228 --> 38:05.394
Not even Cappie.

38:07.464 --> 38:08.664
Dale just threw up.

38:10.334 --> 38:12.702
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:12.736 --> 38:15.504
Oh, Dana. This is my sister, Casey.

38:17.975 --> 38:19.976
I didn't know you have a sister.

38:36.584 --> 38:39.452
Oh, my God, you should've seen your face!
You were so surprised.

38:39.487 --> 38:41.988
I... Yes, I was. Thanks, Abby.

38:46.260 --> 38:48.428
OK, there are a lot of
really cute guys here.

38:48.462 --> 38:49.762
You're still on vacation.

38:50.931 --> 38:52.832
Not sure my vacation
worked out, Ash.

38:52.867 --> 38:54.834
So I'm calling it a night.

38:56.770 --> 38:59.672
Despite Dale's vomit,
I'm really enjoying Myrtle Beach.

39:01.242 --> 39:02.709
Uh-oh, here comes Calvin.

39:02.743 --> 39:05.445
No fighting, OK? We need
some BattleBots or something.

39:07.648 --> 39:11.885
- So?
- Phase four is complete.

39:11.919 --> 39:13.553
Even Trip said he'd vote for me.

39:13.587 --> 39:17.457
Then may Iongratulate the
future president of Omega Chi.

39:17.491 --> 39:21.060
What? - As president,
I think my first order of business will be

39:21.095 --> 39:23.630
to declare a truce between
Kappa Tau and Omega Chi.

39:23.664 --> 39:25.365
Wait, what? It was all a joke?

39:26.399 --> 39:30.170
A series of phases, to be exact,
concocted by our Revenge Chair.

39:30.704 --> 39:33.740
The entire plot was brought to you
by the brotherhood of Kappa Tau.

39:33.774 --> 39:37.844
The mob guy was actually Brother
Rubik's Cube, Class of '85.

39:37.878 --> 39:41.814
The Myrtle Beach cops were Brothers Pez,
Paisley, Tricky Dick and Disco Dan.

39:41.849 --> 39:45.018
All KT Brothers from the University
of South Carolina, class of '79.

39:45.052 --> 39:46.986
- Brothers for life.
- Mmm-hmm.

39:47.021 --> 39:49.989
What are you gonna do now that you don't
have Omega Chi to kick around anymore?

39:50.024 --> 39:52.659
Enjoy life? - [Cappie] I don't know,
I saw Lambda Sig

39:52.693 --> 39:54.961
looking at me funny last week.
I didn't care for that.

39:54.995 --> 39:57.664
I'm gonna get to the
bottom of it. - Hey...

39:57.698 --> 40:00.233
- How about we go on that walk now?
- Oh, OK. Yeah.

40:00.267 --> 40:02.702
- Sure.
- Beav...

40:10.544 --> 40:12.512
Rebecca! Wait, wait, listen!

40:12.546 --> 40:15.214
I'm... [exhales]

40:17.017 --> 40:20.954
- You're what?
- I'm not the good guy.

40:20.988 --> 40:23.456
I don't always do the
right thing all the time.

40:23.490 --> 40:26.659
And I'm always blaming
my parents or the money.

40:26.694 --> 40:29.529
But the only person
to blame is myself.

40:29.563 --> 40:33.433
I let my pride get in the way,
d I don't want to lose you.

40:36.670 --> 40:38.871
You can forget what a mess I am?

40:40.040 --> 40:42.609
You cheated on me because
you don't believe

40:42.643 --> 40:44.477
you deserve happiness, but you do.

40:46.580 --> 40:49.983
I do. And we can
find that together.

40:51.185 --> 40:52.652
I'd like to try.

40:58.826 --> 41:02.762
So, uh, I've been waiting
for the perfect moment

41:02.796 --> 41:04.697
to give you something, and, um...

41:06.233 --> 41:08.635
Well, I think now's
as good a time as any.

41:08.669 --> 41:10.169
Oh? What is it?

41:18.278 --> 41:20.046
I want you to wear my lavaliere.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.781
I love you, Casey.

41:22.816 --> 41:24.050
I love you, too.

41:24.084 --> 41:26.319
You're not as excited
as I thought you'd be.

41:26.353 --> 41:27.754
Is it because of where it's been?

41:27.788 --> 41:32.125
What? No, it's just, um...

41:32.159 --> 41:34.761
I didn't bungee jump today
because I was scared.

41:34.795 --> 41:39.132
And if I stay in Cyprus,
I'd be staying because I'm scared.

41:43.504 --> 41:45.505
You're going to Washington,
aren't you?

41:45.539 --> 41:49.275
I have to do what's best for me,
and that's law school.

41:49.309 --> 41:51.678
Don't you want me
to go and succeed?

41:51.712 --> 41:54.480
I do. I guess I'm being selfish

41:54.515 --> 41:56.683
because I know that means
I'm gonna lose you.

41:58.686 --> 42:00.687
Cap, you can come with me!
To Washington!

42:00.721 --> 42:03.256
- You could transfer...
- I'm not sure I can leave.

42:03.290 --> 42:04.824
And I can't stay.

42:04.858 --> 42:07.860
But, Cap, I totally understand
why you're scared to go.

42:08.829 --> 42:11.531
- I'm not scared.
- That's OK.

42:11.565 --> 42:13.466
Leaving something
can be terrifying...

42:13.500 --> 42:15.334
Is that what you're doing?
Are you leaving me behind?

42:15.369 --> 42:17.003
No, I want us to move
forward, together!

42:17.037 --> 42:18.171
I don't want to move forward!

42:18.205 --> 42:19.405
Because you don't want to grow up!

42:19.440 --> 42:21.074
Then what other choice do we have?

42:26.480 --> 42:29.882
We are two different people
who love each other very much.

42:29.917 --> 42:32.185
It seems like the only
place where our differences

42:32.219 --> 42:33.619
don't matter is in college.

42:35.422 --> 42:37.890
Maybe this is just one of those
college relationships, huh?

42:37.925 --> 42:41.894
If it is, it's the
best one of all time.

42:44.098 --> 42:47.433
Look, let's just finish the
year out together, and...

42:47.468 --> 42:49.869
No, screw it.
You know what? Why wait?

42:49.903 --> 42:52.105
If you don't have more
faith in us than that?

42:52.139 --> 42:55.041
- Then we should break up now.
- No, I don't want to.

42:55.075 --> 42:56.642
Well, too late.
It's done. All right?

42:56.677 --> 42:59.679
I can't believe I was gonna
give this to you tonight.

42:59.713 --> 43:02.148
I would've felt pretty college
doing something like that.

43:02.182 --> 43:03.583
Cappie, please... Cappie...

43:06.854 --> 43:08.387
Cappie...
