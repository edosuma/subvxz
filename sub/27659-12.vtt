WEBVTT

00:03.940 --> 00:06.030
Hey, what's up?
I came as fast as I could.

00:06.080 --> 00:07.380
Title of your sex tape.
Nailed it.

00:07.430 --> 00:09.470
So have you ever heard of a guy
named Bruno Rojas?

00:09.520 --> 00:10.990
Yeah, big guy
in the Colombian cartel, right?

00:11.040 --> 00:12.910
He was, until he got shot
in the chest yesterday

00:12.950 --> 00:14.390
by his top lieutenant.

00:14.430 --> 00:16.040
Apparently, the bullet went
straight through his nipple.

00:16.090 --> 00:17.480
Whoa.
Nature's bull's-eye.

00:17.520 --> 00:18.870
Oh, my God, I love the way
your brain works.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.870
Anyway, he's in a coma now,
and Captain Holt thinks

00:20.920 --> 00:22.920
if I'm here when he wakes up,
I can get him to talk.

00:22.960 --> 00:24.970
- So what'd you call me for?
- Because I need a partner.

00:25.010 --> 00:27.230
- What about them?
- Oh, we're not here for work.

00:27.270 --> 00:29.360
I brought Scully in because
he needs some medical tests.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.930
Yeah, I'm here all the time.

00:30.970 --> 00:32.580
I'm kind of the mayor
of this place.

00:32.630 --> 00:34.840
Cheryl, baby,
you got a fresh bag for me?

00:34.890 --> 00:36.460
Saving you the biggest one,
Scully.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.500
You're too good to me.

00:37.540 --> 00:39.240
Anyway, I'll see you guys
around.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.680
Dan, Dan, the enema man.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.815
Well, guess it's kind of nice
to see Scully in his element.

00:43.816 --> 00:44.445
Whoo!

00:44.446 --> 00:47.919
Jake, I can't stay here with you.
I have so much on my plate at work.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.300
Yeah, so do I. I mean, I've been
pulling double shifts nonstop,

00:51.340 --> 00:53.932
but we haven't really gotten
to hang out in almost a month.

00:53.935 --> 00:56.579
Our anniversary is coming up, and
we don't even have anything planned.

00:56.580 --> 00:58.445
I know,
but we talked about this.

00:58.450 --> 01:00.415
We're gonna take a trip
as soon as we have time.

01:00.416 --> 01:01.979
- I promise.
- Just like you promised

01:01.980 --> 01:03.050
we would see
the "Bumblebee" movie?

01:03.051 --> 01:05.144
I didn't promise that.
I believe what I said was,

01:05.144 --> 01:06.259
"Isn't that a kids' movie?"

01:06.260 --> 01:08.019
Yeah, and I believe
what I said was,

01:08.020 --> 01:10.510
"It's for teens."

01:10.511 --> 01:12.957
Look, I get that you can't
take any time off from work,

01:12.960 --> 01:15.300
but this is a loophole.
It's still work.

01:15.340 --> 01:18.365
You know, we can hang out here
and chat and catch up and laugh,

01:18.366 --> 01:23.194
and technically, we'll be doing our jobs.
I call it a "casecation."

01:23.200 --> 01:25.987
<i>♪ Casecation,
all I ever wanted ♪</i>

01:25.990 --> 01:26.510
Ooh.

01:26.511 --> 01:28.894
<i>♪ Casecation,
had to get away ♪</i>

01:28.895 --> 01:30.285
Babe, this is so sweet,

01:30.335 --> 01:32.505
but do you honestly think
that Holt's gonna let me

01:32.545 --> 01:34.297
just hang out here
with you indefinitely?

01:34.298 --> 01:35.599
Yes. Just tell him
I need supervision.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.485
I've spent the last six years
building up a reputation

01:37.486 --> 01:39.373
as an irresponsible goof
for this very moment.

01:39.375 --> 01:41.450
That is ridiculous.
Holt respects you.

01:41.451 --> 01:42.244
Does he, though?

01:43.851 --> 01:46.257
Hello, you've reached
the office of Raymond Holt.

01:46.258 --> 01:47.717
I can come to the phone
right now.

01:47.718 --> 01:49.793
Hey, sir, I'm just here
at the hospital with Jake,

01:49.795 --> 01:50.994
and I think he could use some...

01:50.995 --> 01:52.901
Oversight?
Agreed.

01:54.175 --> 01:57.405
- So?

Prepare to be romanced.

02:19.605 --> 02:20.745
Voilà.

02:20.746 --> 02:22.475
Bienvenue à Paris.

02:22.515 --> 02:24.650
Bonjour, madame. Fromage?

02:24.651 --> 02:25.991
Don't worry,
Charles is leaving in a second.

02:25.992 --> 02:26.440
I am?

02:26.441 --> 02:27.663
Yeah, you were just
helping me set up.

02:27.665 --> 02:29.487
Fine. Enjoy your weird anniversary

02:29.488 --> 02:31.725
- with just the couple.
- You selfish jerks.

02:31.750 --> 02:34.100
Thank you for your help!

02:34.150 --> 02:37.370
- So what do you think?
- I love it.

02:37.410 --> 02:39.200
- It's really romantic.
- Aww.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.590
I mean,
except for the comatose body

02:40.637 --> 02:41.385
in the middle of the room.

02:41.386 --> 02:43.110
Oh, yeah, just pretend
he's part of Paris.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.290
Imagine we're on a walking tour

02:44.330 --> 02:46.330
of the Louvre,
and he's a statue.

02:46.380 --> 02:48.380
- Oh.
- Yeah. Shall we, ma chérie?

02:48.420 --> 02:50.820
I asked the lady at the store
what her favorite cheeses were,

02:50.860 --> 02:52.300
and those were all
super expensive,

02:52.340 --> 02:54.860
so I got us a budget-conscious
selection of local cheddars.

02:54.910 --> 02:58.820
So, a full year of marriage.
What was your favorite part?

02:58.870 --> 03:01.040
Are you asking me
to do a marriage highlight reel

03:01.090 --> 03:02.480
countdown
à la "NBA Inside Stuff"?

03:02.520 --> 03:04.117
I mean, that's not exactly
what I was...

03:04.118 --> 03:05.480
Number five!

03:05.485 --> 03:07.394
Ahmad Rashad.
It's my best impression.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.392
Number five was the time

03:08.393 --> 03:10.890
that we accidentally got
our contact lenses switched.

03:10.930 --> 03:12.060
I got to see the world
through your eyes.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.405
But our prescriptions are different,

03:13.406 --> 03:15.288
- and the world was so blurry.
- Yeah, it was crazy.

03:15.290 --> 03:16.309
I thought I was having a stroke.

03:16.310 --> 03:18.126
- Okay, your turn.
- Number four!

03:18.128 --> 03:20.273
Oh, is an old witch
introducing this highlight?

03:20.274 --> 03:21.810
That was exactly
what you sounded like.

03:21.850 --> 03:22.433
- No.
- Yes.

03:22.435 --> 03:23.435
- Agree to disagree.
- Fine.

03:23.436 --> 03:25.765
Number four was
when we played laser tag

03:25.766 --> 03:27.300
and we shot all those
little kids.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.600
Oh, yeah. We really messed up
little Mason's birthday party.

03:29.650 --> 03:30.610
- Mm-hmm.
- Deservedly so.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.650
- He was a jerk.
- Ugh.

03:31.690 --> 03:32.870
Okay, what should
number three be?

03:32.910 --> 03:33.536
Ooh, I know.

03:33.537 --> 03:36.270
It was that time we shared
an UberPool with Michael Caine.

03:36.271 --> 03:36.899
Oh!

03:42.377 --> 03:43.640
I mean, obviously, Michael Caine

03:43.665 --> 03:45.660
was shooting a movie in London
at that time, and also,

03:45.670 --> 03:47.240
why would Michael Caine be
in an UberPool?

03:47.280 --> 03:48.958
- But it was still so cool.
- It really was.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.635
- We shared a car with Alfred.
- We did!

03:50.690 --> 03:52.562
Okay, number two.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.221
This might be my favorite moment

03:54.261 --> 03:56.820
of our entire time as a couple:
January 6th.

03:56.821 --> 03:58.791
- Eddie Redmayne's birthday.
- Why do you know that?

03:58.792 --> 04:00.001
'Cause he was weird
in "Jupiter Ascending."

04:00.051 --> 04:01.531
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm just a fan.

04:01.578 --> 04:02.548
Yeah, that's not what
I'm talking about.

04:02.549 --> 04:03.061
Okay.

04:05.805 --> 04:07.065
It was the coldest night
of the year,

04:07.105 --> 04:09.675
and you put socks on my feet
while I slept.

04:09.715 --> 04:11.635
You never even took credit
for it.

04:11.675 --> 04:12.855
But now I'm getting credit
for that

04:12.895 --> 04:14.545
and for not taking credit.

04:14.595 --> 04:16.115
That's double credit, you fool.

04:16.165 --> 04:18.065
You two are just the cutest.

04:18.065 --> 04:20.035
I can't wait for number one!

04:20.045 --> 04:21.774
Oh, it's Ahmad Rashad.

04:21.815 --> 04:23.645
I'm Pam.
I'm from next door.

04:23.685 --> 04:26.735
I was listening to the two of you
talk and just had to get a look.

04:26.775 --> 04:30.215
You're both very attractive.

04:30.216 --> 04:34.006
- Aren't they?
- Boyle, go home!

04:34.046 --> 04:35.486
Oh, Pam can stay but not me?

04:35.526 --> 04:36.796
Yeah, because
she's a patient here.

04:36.836 --> 04:38.276
I'm assuming,
because of your gown.

04:38.316 --> 04:39.706
I am.
I have a twisted bowel.

04:39.756 --> 04:42.846
I have a tube; I have a bag.
Do you want to see?

04:42.886 --> 04:44.496
Oh, no, no, no.
But thank you, Pam.

04:44.536 --> 04:46.546
Let me know
if you smell anything.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.246
I don't even notice it anymore.

04:48.247 --> 04:50.486
Well, I'm pretty sure I actually
already smell something.

04:50.496 --> 04:52.326
- No, you'll know.
- Oh.

04:52.327 --> 04:53.654
Do you two have kids?

04:53.655 --> 04:56.830
Mixed race babies are always
so adorable.

04:56.831 --> 04:58.999
Oh, you said words.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.789
Yeah, we don't have kids yet,

05:00.829 --> 05:02.269
but we're gonna start trying
soon.

05:02.309 --> 05:04.269
I just have the one, my Bobby.

05:04.309 --> 05:07.929
He was such a cute little kid,
until he discovered his wiener.

05:07.969 --> 05:11.449
Pam, there you are.
It's time for your IV.

05:11.499 --> 05:13.849
You're playing music in here?
You can't do that.

05:13.889 --> 05:15.279
Why not, Nurse Janet?

05:15.329 --> 05:17.279
Is it gonna distract
the doctors?

05:17.329 --> 05:19.289
Yes, that's exactly
what it'll do.

05:19.329 --> 05:20.809
Okay, fine,
I'll turn it off immediately.

05:23.329 --> 05:25.509
- Are we the bad guys here?
- Yeah, it seems very likely.

05:25.549 --> 05:27.328
Hey, by the way, we don't have
to pretend we're undercover here.

05:27.329 --> 05:28.539
The hospital staff knows
we're cops.

05:28.589 --> 05:29.719
Oh, I wasn't setting up cover.

05:29.759 --> 05:30.939
- Was I?
- Well, just the kids thing.

05:30.979 --> 05:32.329
Saying that we were gonna
start trying soon.

05:32.369 --> 05:34.639
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean right away.

05:34.679 --> 05:36.989
I just meant in the near future.

05:37.029 --> 05:38.989
Oh.
Okay.

05:39.029 --> 05:40.249
Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool.

05:40.299 --> 05:41.599
Cool, cool, cool, cool,

05:41.639 --> 05:42.989
except for that there's
one little problem there,

05:43.039 --> 05:44.869
which is that I don't know
that I totally know

05:44.909 --> 05:46.855
that I for sure
want to have kids,

05:48.059 --> 05:49.569
so...

05:49.609 --> 05:51.649
- You don't?
- No.

05:51.699 --> 05:54.219
- Do you?
- Uhhuh.

05:54.269 --> 05:56.619
Oh.

05:57.761 --> 05:58.801
I don't understand.
I thought we were

05:58.841 --> 06:00.170
on the same page about kids.

06:00.171 --> 06:01.981
- We talked about this.
- We did?

06:02.021 --> 06:04.981
Aw, look at these pictures
my brother sent of Matthew.

06:05.021 --> 06:06.746
- Mm.
- We should do this someday.

06:06.747 --> 06:07.747
What do you think?

06:07.797 --> 06:08.967
Are you kidding me?
Of course.

06:09.017 --> 06:10.627
I was talking about going
to the water park.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.277
You were talking about
having kids?

06:12.317 --> 06:14.887
Yeah! I said, "Do you think
we can afford it?"

06:14.937 --> 06:17.457
And you said, "We'll start
saving right away."

06:17.497 --> 06:18.677
So let me get this straight.

06:18.717 --> 06:20.547
All that water park money
I've been saving,

06:20.587 --> 06:21.937
you want to spend it
on kids now?

06:21.987 --> 06:23.807
Yeah. Why would you want
to spend that much money

06:23.857 --> 06:24.911
on a water park?

06:24.912 --> 06:26.794
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say here.

06:26.799 --> 06:28.979
I just...
I never wanted children.

06:29.019 --> 06:30.329
Well, I always have.

06:30.369 --> 06:32.679
All right,
so how do we handle this?

06:32.719 --> 06:34.939
I mean, there's only one
thing to do when two people

06:34.989 --> 06:36.954
have diametrically opposing
views on a subject.

06:36.955 --> 06:38.875
Talk about it lovingly
and decide how to move forward?

06:38.876 --> 06:40.634
- Structured debate.
- Oh. Fun.

06:40.635 --> 06:42.595
High school format.
Modified Lincoln-Douglas.

06:42.645 --> 06:45.425
Let's take one hour apart
for research and prep. Yeah.

06:45.465 --> 06:47.735
Great, I'll just do
a Lincoln-Douglas.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.605
I'd be careful if I were you.
Relationships are like bowels.

06:50.645 --> 06:53.215
Once you get them twisted,
they can never untwist.

06:53.265 --> 06:55.045
Pam, you're in here again.

07:03.445 --> 07:04.160
That's all you prepped?

07:04.162 --> 07:05.202
Yeah, I just searched my heart

07:05.252 --> 07:06.952
and then wrote down
how I was feeling.

07:06.992 --> 07:09.172
I'm gonna eat you alive,
you dumb son of a bitch.

07:09.212 --> 07:11.472
Cool. And then
we'll have kids together?

07:11.522 --> 07:12.782
Yeah. It's gonna be great.

07:12.822 --> 07:14.082
Okay, the topic today

07:14.132 --> 07:16.002
is whether or not
we should have children.

07:16.042 --> 07:17.132
I will be taking
the affirmative.

07:17.172 --> 07:18.302
You will be taking the negative.

07:18.352 --> 07:21.302
Each round will be individually
scored by our judge, Captain Holt.

07:21.303 --> 07:22.733
Do you need to hear
my credentials?

07:22.783 --> 07:25.873
Debate moderator license
D as in delta, 8-1-0...

07:25.913 --> 07:27.833
- I believe you.
- Y as in Yankee, 4-1.

07:27.873 --> 07:30.263
J as in Juliet,
J as in Juliet, 6.

07:30.313 --> 07:31.815
- Great.
- I have a variety of timers.

07:31.817 --> 07:33.427
- Do you prefer a buzz or a ding?
- Don't care.

07:33.467 --> 07:34.295
- Ding.
- Okay.

07:34.296 --> 07:37.036
Peralta, you can present the
first argument from your, uh...

07:37.086 --> 07:39.160
Scribbled list of feelings.

07:39.161 --> 07:40.096
I'll have you know

07:40.097 --> 07:42.290
that I have some
data-driven arguments as well.

07:42.291 --> 07:45.480
According to a study I read,
people with kids

07:45.481 --> 07:47.781
were less likely to report that
they were happy in their lives

07:47.831 --> 07:49.056
than people without kids.

07:49.057 --> 07:52.187
Now, call me crazy, but being
happy tends to make me feel,

07:52.237 --> 07:53.367
uh, pretty happy.

07:53.407 --> 07:54.300
Where did you read this study?

07:54.301 --> 07:57.651
Well, it wasn't something I read
so much as told about.

07:57.701 --> 07:58.831
And who told you about it?

08:01.441 --> 08:03.001
- Hitchcock.
- Hitchcock?

08:03.006 --> 08:03.788
- Yeah.
- That seems like

08:03.789 --> 08:05.930
a pretty intellectual thing
for him to mention.

08:05.934 --> 08:06.864
What was the context?

08:06.865 --> 08:10.135
He had invested in a NuvaRing
competitor called Vag-a-Plug

08:10.136 --> 08:11.777
and was practicing
his sales pitch on me.

08:11.827 --> 08:13.827
This is your first argument?
Your opening statement?

08:13.867 --> 08:14.626
Point to Amy.

08:14.627 --> 08:16.017
All right, fine.
Forget the study.

08:16.057 --> 08:17.797
I just don't want to lose
what we already have.

08:17.847 --> 08:20.017
Ask anyone with children
and they'll tell you

08:20.067 --> 08:23.107
children bring meaning and love
into your life.

08:23.157 --> 08:25.377
Yes, there may be some moments
that you lose,

08:25.417 --> 08:27.377
but there will also be
new moments.

08:27.417 --> 08:28.535
Take the water park.

08:28.536 --> 08:32.535
I would never go with you,
but you know who would?

08:32.586 --> 08:35.068
- Your kid.
- Point to Amy.

08:35.075 --> 08:36.645
That's not your call to make,
Peralta.

08:36.684 --> 08:37.945
Point to Amy.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.905
Okay, fine.
New Subject: work.

08:39.945 --> 08:41.775
We both work way too much.

08:41.815 --> 08:44.385
Why bother having kids if you
never get to spend time with them?

08:44.435 --> 08:46.785
I mean, I love my job,
and I know you love yours,

08:46.825 --> 08:49.062
and I don't think it's fair for either
of us to have to sacrifice that.

08:49.063 --> 08:51.023
Do you know why I want to
become lieutenant so badly?

08:51.025 --> 08:52.685
To prove your worth to
your hyper judgmental parents.

08:52.725 --> 08:53.945
Yes, obviously that.

08:53.985 --> 08:57.075
But also, the higher your rank,
the more control over your hours.

08:57.115 --> 09:00.139
Plenty of people have jobs and
kids, Jake, and they find a way.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.302
This has become more about
your employment status.

09:02.303 --> 09:05.040
As your supervisor, I feel
I have a conflict of interest

09:05.041 --> 09:08.181
- and should abstain from judging.
- Okay, so do we both get a point?

09:08.221 --> 09:09.974
No. Kevin has been
on the phone all this time.

09:09.975 --> 09:11.975
He's also a licensed
debate moderator.

09:12.015 --> 09:14.625
License number
J as in Juliet, 2-5-9...

09:14.675 --> 09:16.415
- This means nothing to me.
- H as in hotel.

09:16.455 --> 09:18.155
- Z as in Zulu.
- Oh, thank God he stopped.

09:18.195 --> 09:19.455
3-6-9.

09:19.505 --> 09:21.335
- Point to Amy.
- Okay, fine.

09:21.375 --> 09:24.945
You want to know why I really
don't want to have children?

09:24.985 --> 09:27.115
I had a crappy dad.

09:27.165 --> 09:28.995
I know what happens
when you mess up as a parent.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.515
It's not great.

09:30.555 --> 09:33.345
And this may come as a shock
to you, but...

09:33.385 --> 09:35.414
I kind of have some dad issues
with certain people.

09:35.415 --> 09:35.975
- Holt.
- Me.

09:35.977 --> 09:37.417
- Raymond.
- Yeah, but not just him.

09:37.457 --> 09:39.937
It's every male authority
figure from my entire life.

09:39.987 --> 09:41.727
Hey, Jake, can you move
"Legends of the Fall"

09:41.767 --> 09:42.817
from new releases into drama?

09:42.857 --> 09:43.897
You got it, Dad.

09:43.947 --> 09:45.907
Craig was only six weeks older
than me.

09:45.947 --> 09:47.257
Since this has become about me,

09:47.297 --> 09:49.127
I'm gonna have to abstain
from this round as well,

09:49.167 --> 09:50.737
but Kevin is still standing by.

09:50.777 --> 09:52.387
Actually, I feel as though
your personal relationship

09:52.427 --> 09:54.087
with Peralta affects me too.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.917
Luckily, I had Gail
standing by as well.

09:55.957 --> 09:57.527
Oh, my God, you guys know Gail?

09:57.567 --> 09:58.334
Who's Gail?

09:58.335 --> 09:59.885
Vice president
of the Debaters Club.

09:59.886 --> 10:01.456
This is a very big deal.

10:01.496 --> 10:02.636
Do you need to hear
my credentials?

10:02.676 --> 10:04.554
License number
U as in uniform, 7...

10:04.555 --> 10:06.735
No!
No more credentials, please.

10:06.775 --> 10:08.125
I don't want to have
a structured debate.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.785
It's an idiotic way
to decide something.

10:09.825 --> 10:11.125
- What?
- How dare you?

10:11.126 --> 10:13.586
- Is he insane?
- Raymond, Kevin, I'll be reporting this.

10:13.588 --> 10:14.758
Okay, look.

10:14.808 --> 10:17.978
Amy, I'm scared, okay?

10:18.028 --> 10:20.572
I'm scared that we're gonna have a
child and I won't be able to handle it,

10:20.573 --> 10:22.053
I'm scared that
I'm not gonna be a good father,

10:22.093 --> 10:25.223
and I'm scared that I'll make
a mistake I can't take back.

10:25.273 --> 10:27.923
Jake, I get it.
I'm scared too.

10:27.963 --> 10:29.843
Every other big decision
I've made in my life

10:29.883 --> 10:30.973
I was sure about:

10:31.013 --> 10:32.793
becoming a cop,
asking you to marry me,

10:32.843 --> 10:34.933
buying those Jordan 1s for $500.

10:34.973 --> 10:36.673
Wait, you spent $500
on sneakers?

10:36.713 --> 10:38.503
Yeah, they were so cool,
and if I had never worn them,

10:38.543 --> 10:39.548
they would have kept
their value.

10:39.549 --> 10:41.159
- So they lost their value?
- Yes, all of it.

10:41.199 --> 10:42.769
I stepped in a puddle
as soon as I left the store.

10:42.809 --> 10:43.939
But this isn't about
the Jordans.

10:43.979 --> 10:45.419
This is about the fact

10:45.459 --> 10:47.859
that I don't want to bring
a human being into this world

10:47.899 --> 10:51.689
unless I'm 100% sure that
I'm ready to take care of it.

10:51.729 --> 10:53.469
Okay?

10:53.519 --> 10:55.129
Too emotional.
Point to Amy.

10:55.169 --> 10:56.559
Okay, Gail is clearly biased.

10:56.609 --> 10:58.129
I think we need a new moderator.

10:58.169 --> 10:59.429
Bob Templeman here.

10:59.479 --> 11:01.519
What? How many people
are on this phone call?

11:03.286 --> 11:05.908
Hey, so Holt went to go
smooth things over with Gail.

11:05.909 --> 11:08.259
He thinks we may just have to pay
the Debaters Guild a small fine.

11:08.309 --> 11:10.349
Cool. And as you can see,
Pam is here.

11:10.399 --> 11:11.619
She has some thoughts.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.582
I was saying to Jake,
before Bobby,

11:13.583 --> 11:15.493
I didn't think I wanted
to have kids either.

11:15.495 --> 11:17.801
But he's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.722
Hey, Pam, could you give us
a minute?

11:19.762 --> 11:22.032
Oh, of course.
I'm gonna call my friend JoAnn.

11:22.072 --> 11:24.902
She's been waiting for
a big update on all of this.

11:24.942 --> 11:25.808
Great.

11:30.122 --> 11:32.602
I'm sorry.
The debate was a bad idea.

11:32.652 --> 11:34.132
I just...

11:34.172 --> 11:36.432
I felt ambushed by the fact
that you didn't want kids,

11:36.482 --> 11:38.092
and I thought I could fix it
with logic.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.612
I mean,
what if I had won the debate?

11:39.652 --> 11:40.962
Jake, I'm trying so hard
to be nice,

11:41.002 --> 11:42.482
but I don't know how to respond
to that.

11:42.522 --> 11:43.662
- Cold-blooded but fair.
- I get it.

11:43.702 --> 11:46.189
You're scared.
I can't change that.

11:46.192 --> 11:48.792
Yeah, but that doesn't mean I'll
never change how I feel about it.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.492
I mean, I used to be scared of
sushi, and now it's my favorite food.

11:51.532 --> 11:53.622
I got tuna sashimi
from a pharmacy the other day.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.282
- You shouldn't have.
- Yeah, it was very warm.

11:55.322 --> 11:56.672
I got so sick.

11:56.712 --> 11:58.852
Look, can we just press pause
on this conversation?

11:58.892 --> 12:00.762
I mean, let's enjoy our lives
for a little bit,

12:00.802 --> 12:02.462
and then maybe the next time
it comes up,

12:02.502 --> 12:04.682
I'll feel differently, okay?

12:07.422 --> 12:08.772
- No.
- What?

12:08.812 --> 12:10.122
I need an answer from you now.

12:10.162 --> 12:11.642
Like right this minute?

12:11.682 --> 12:13.642
You can take a day or a week,

12:13.692 --> 12:14.992
or maybe a month.

12:15.042 --> 12:17.822
That's not a lot of time, Ames.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.042
I mean, that doesn't seem
totally fair.

12:20.082 --> 12:21.482
Well, now you know how I feel.

12:21.522 --> 12:24.092
Women don't have the luxury
of waiting till we're 60

12:24.132 --> 12:26.262
and then changing our minds
and getting remarried

12:26.312 --> 12:28.612
and having a baby
with some dumb 28-year-old.

12:28.662 --> 12:29.702
Oh, come on.

12:29.752 --> 12:31.012
There's no way
I'm gonna be rich enough

12:31.052 --> 12:33.972
that a 28-year-old
is gonna want to be with me.

12:34.012 --> 12:35.232
Did that help?

12:35.272 --> 12:36.802
Look, I don't understand
what the big deal is.

12:36.842 --> 12:38.492
You're still young.
We have plenty of time.

12:38.542 --> 12:40.932
I know, but I don't want
to wait around for two years

12:40.972 --> 12:42.802
and then have you decide
you don't want kids,

12:42.852 --> 12:45.592
'cause I don't want
to start over at 38.

12:45.632 --> 12:48.592
Start over?

12:48.632 --> 12:49.772
Like, with someone else?

12:49.812 --> 12:53.332
<i>♪ Casecation,
all I ever wanted ♪</i>

12:53.382 --> 12:56.252
<i>♪ Casecation, had to get away ♪</i>

12:56.292 --> 12:57.562
<i>♪ Casecation ♪</i>

12:57.602 --> 12:59.692
<i>♪ The vibe in here
is really weird ♪</i>

12:59.732 --> 13:02.002
- I think they're having a fight.
- No, it's not a fight,

13:02.042 --> 13:04.482
it's just a devastatingly sad
conversation

13:04.522 --> 13:06.962
about whether or not we should
have kids or just start over,

13:07.002 --> 13:08.792
so you were totally wrong, Rosa.

13:08.832 --> 13:11.792
What? You got married without
talking about if you want children?

13:11.832 --> 13:13.458
Yeah, and we also got
married without discussing

13:13.459 --> 13:14.182
whether or not we like water parks.

13:14.232 --> 13:15.702
A lot of new stuff has come up,
okay, Terry?

13:15.752 --> 13:17.322
- Why are you guys here?
- A CI came in.

13:17.362 --> 13:18.842
There's a lot of chatter that
whoever tried to kill Rojas

13:18.882 --> 13:19.842
is coming to finish the job.

13:19.882 --> 13:20.932
- At the hospital?
- Yeah.

13:20.972 --> 13:22.452
Holt wanted extra manpower here.

13:22.492 --> 13:24.502
Okay, why don't you two
lock down the nurses' station

13:24.542 --> 13:25.852
while Amy and I secure the room?

13:25.892 --> 13:27.462
Actually,
I'd rather be with Rosa.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.502
- Uh-oh.
- Damn, Jake.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.202
Thanks a lot, Sarge.

13:30.242 --> 13:31.072
You told me to sing!

13:31.112 --> 13:32.552
Yeah, but what was all this?

13:32.592 --> 13:34.382
That's just Terry being Terry.

13:34.422 --> 13:37.292
Okay, from this vantage we can
see the elevator and the stairs.

13:37.342 --> 13:39.552
No one should be able to get
to Rojas without us noticing.

13:39.602 --> 13:41.382
- Cool.
- Hey, look, um...

13:41.432 --> 13:43.382
I don't want you to get caught
in the middle of this stuff

13:43.432 --> 13:44.392
between me and Jake.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.602
I don't want you
to choose sides.

13:45.652 --> 13:47.002
- Already chose. I'm with you.
- Really?

13:47.042 --> 13:48.092
I didn't know you wanted kids.

13:48.132 --> 13:49.262
I don't know
if I'll ever want kids,

13:49.302 --> 13:50.652
but you should have them.
They're so cute.

13:50.702 --> 13:52.572
It's f****** up.
Aw, it is f****** up.

13:52.612 --> 13:53.742
Anyway, do you want me
to talk to Jake?

13:53.792 --> 13:55.482
- I'm a pretty good bully.
- Thanks, but no.

13:55.532 --> 13:58.102
I've got this covered.
I left him alone with Terry.

13:58.142 --> 13:59.662
That guy is
a walking advertisement

13:59.712 --> 14:00.972
for the joys of fatherhood.

14:01.012 --> 14:04.062
- Do not do it.
- What?

14:04.102 --> 14:05.892
- Don't you love your girls?
- So much.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.152
You should have seen Cagney
this morning

14:07.192 --> 14:09.022
- with her little braids in.
- Oh.

14:09.062 --> 14:10.932
But they are a ton of work, man.

14:10.982 --> 14:13.892
If you are not totally,
100% sure you want them,

14:13.942 --> 14:14.892
you won't survive.

14:14.942 --> 14:16.902
- Is it really that hard?
- Yes.

14:16.942 --> 14:19.252
I never get any sleep.
I'm always sick.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.602
I never get to watch anything
I want on TV.

14:21.642 --> 14:23.252
I still haven't finished
"Breaking Bad,"

14:23.292 --> 14:25.082
but I can recite "Moana"
from memory?

14:25.122 --> 14:28.172
"Maui, shape-shifter,
demigod of the wind and sea.

14:28.212 --> 14:30.782
I am Moana."
Why do I know that?

14:30.822 --> 14:32.002
I don't want to watch
kids' movies.

14:32.042 --> 14:33.522
I want to watch movies
for adults.

14:33.572 --> 14:34.612
Adults and teens.

14:34.652 --> 14:36.262
And they are getting
so manipulative.

14:36.312 --> 14:38.612
Yesterday,
Cagney pretended to be hurt,

14:38.662 --> 14:40.012
I went in to help her,

14:40.052 --> 14:42.272
and Lacey snuck in the kitchen
and stole two cookies.

14:42.312 --> 14:44.102
Oh, my God.
Your children are monsters.

14:44.142 --> 14:45.532
Hey, those are my kids, man.

14:45.582 --> 14:46.712
- Back off.
- Right.

14:46.752 --> 14:49.672
And the crazy part is, I really do
want to go to the water park,

14:49.712 --> 14:51.932
but I can't give that to him
because it's the only card I hold.

14:51.982 --> 14:53.112
Mm.

14:53.152 --> 14:54.592
Elevator.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.852
Excuse me, NYPD.
Can I see your ID?

14:58.502 --> 14:59.772
Amy, behind the wheelchair.

14:59.812 --> 15:01.592
NYPD! Stop!

15:05.862 --> 15:07.952
- Diaz for Jeffords.
- This is Terry.

15:07.992 --> 15:09.212
I think we got our guy.
Colombian man,

15:09.252 --> 15:10.652
unarmed, but he tried to run

15:10.692 --> 15:12.002
as soon as we identified
ourselves.

15:12.042 --> 15:13.652
And he's got a picture of Rojas
on his phone.

15:13.692 --> 15:15.822
We'll be right there.

15:15.872 --> 15:17.652
No one in or out
of this hallway.

15:17.702 --> 15:19.962
Why do you think that guy
is unarmed?

15:20.002 --> 15:21.832
Who knows? Maybe he was
trying to smother Rojas

15:21.872 --> 15:23.142
or unplug his life support.

15:23.182 --> 15:25.922
Or maybe he's a distraction,

15:25.972 --> 15:28.192
and someone else is going
for the cookie jar.

15:28.232 --> 15:29.232
What?

15:33.632 --> 15:36.672
- Hi, Pam.
- Hi, Jake.

15:36.722 --> 15:39.372
Don't come any closer,
or I'll blow us both up!

15:42.811 --> 15:43.621
I'm sorry.

15:43.749 --> 15:45.049
You weren't supposed to be here.

15:45.099 --> 15:46.709
- This wasn't part of the plan.
- It's okay, Pam.

15:46.749 --> 15:48.059
No need to panic.
We're just talking.

15:48.099 --> 15:51.279
Look, I'm just gonna
put this away.

15:51.319 --> 15:53.209
No, Terry,
don't open that, please.

15:53.210 --> 15:54.189
What's going on in there?

15:54.239 --> 15:56.109
There is a woman in here
with an explosive device.

15:56.149 --> 15:58.239
- What? You okay?
- Yep. Everyone is fine.

15:58.279 --> 16:00.239
I just need you to evacuate
this entire floor,

16:00.289 --> 16:02.329
call ESU and the bomb squad
right away,

16:02.369 --> 16:04.379
and jam all cellular
and Wi-Fi signals.

16:04.419 --> 16:05.989
On it.

16:06.029 --> 16:08.819
Okay, Pam, so we're just
gonna stay calm here

16:08.859 --> 16:10.209
and talk this thing through
as friends.

16:10.249 --> 16:12.039
This isn't supposed to be
happening.

16:12.079 --> 16:15.350
The man said that I'd be able
to sneak in here unnoticed.

16:15.351 --> 16:16.581
What man?
Who asked you to do this?

16:16.582 --> 16:18.622
I didn't get his name,
but he was very attractive.

16:18.662 --> 16:20.452
Antonio Banderas could play him
in a movie.

16:20.492 --> 16:21.972
What has he been doing lately?

16:22.022 --> 16:23.892
You know what?
He should be on "Outlander."

16:23.932 --> 16:25.062
Okay, Pam,
I'm gonna cut you off,

16:25.112 --> 16:25.982
but it's not because
I'm not interested.

16:26.022 --> 16:27.112
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.202
I get chatty when I get nervous.

16:28.242 --> 16:29.682
This man who gave you the bomb,

16:29.722 --> 16:31.982
did he happen to mention
whether or not it's on a timer

16:32.032 --> 16:33.372
or if there's
a remote detonator?

16:33.422 --> 16:35.682
I don't know.
I'm terrible with electronics.

16:35.722 --> 16:39.162
I wish my son Bobby were here.
He taught me how to iPad.

16:39.212 --> 16:41.172
Okay, I also know how to iPad,

16:41.212 --> 16:42.862
so maybe I could take a look.

16:42.912 --> 16:44.122
Stay where you are!

16:44.172 --> 16:46.002
The man told me
that when I got the bomb set,

16:46.042 --> 16:48.042
I should text him
with this phone

16:48.092 --> 16:49.432
and if anything went wrong,

16:49.482 --> 16:50.782
I should push this button.

16:50.832 --> 16:52.442
No, no, no, no!
You don't want to do that.

16:52.482 --> 16:53.922
Yes, I do.
I have to.

16:53.962 --> 16:55.442
Well, there's only one thing
to do when two people

16:55.482 --> 16:58.012
have diametrically opposing
opinions on a subject.

16:58.052 --> 17:00.012
- Structured debate.
- What?

17:00.052 --> 17:01.192
Yeah, I just learned about it.

17:01.232 --> 17:02.712
All right, I will argue
the negative:

17:02.752 --> 17:03.752
I don't want to blow up.

17:03.802 --> 17:05.192
And you can argue
the affirmative:

17:05.232 --> 17:07.061
you do want to blow up,
which I have to say, Pam,

17:07.102 --> 17:08.452
is a very tough stance to take.

17:08.502 --> 17:09.541
I don't want to blow up,

17:09.582 --> 17:11.852
but the man said
he'd give me $500,000.

17:11.892 --> 17:14.551
This is so Bobby can take care
of my granddaughter.

17:14.592 --> 17:16.462
That girl means the world to me.

17:16.502 --> 17:17.512
Fine, fine.
Point to Pam.

17:17.551 --> 17:19.031
But if you care about her
so much,

17:19.071 --> 17:20.162
how can you just
blow yourself up?

17:20.202 --> 17:21.162
You'll never get to see her again.

17:21.212 --> 17:23.992
Well, at least I know she'll be
financially well taken care of.

17:24.031 --> 17:27.041
Sure, but is this really how
you want her to remember you?

17:27.082 --> 17:28.602
- As a murderer?
- I'd rather be remembered

17:28.652 --> 17:31.132
as a woman who blew up
a mobster to help her family

17:31.172 --> 17:34.782
rather than a librarian whose bowels
are tied up like a sailor's knot!

17:34.832 --> 17:37.702
Okay, that's a very strong argument.
Very strong.

17:37.742 --> 17:38.922
But you're forgetting one thing.

17:38.962 --> 17:40.492
You're not just gonna be
killing a mobster.

17:40.532 --> 17:41.922
You're also gonna be killing me.

17:41.972 --> 17:44.142
He said the blast would only
hurt people in the room.

17:44.182 --> 17:45.582
You could just walk right out of here.

17:45.622 --> 17:48.322
Pam, you know I can't do that.

17:48.362 --> 17:51.412
- Now, please, just give me the bomb.
- And then what?

17:51.452 --> 17:53.282
Bobby doesn't get any money
and I go to jail?

17:53.322 --> 17:54.592
I can't go to jail.

17:54.632 --> 17:56.762
Every roommate I've ever had
has hated me.

17:56.812 --> 17:58.942
In college, I had a roommate
named Mary-Ellen,

17:58.982 --> 18:01.422
and she was dating the brother
of Steve Guttenberg...

18:01.462 --> 18:02.512
Pam, what are we talking
about here?

18:02.552 --> 18:04.072
I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous.

18:04.122 --> 18:05.422
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I know it probably feels like

18:05.472 --> 18:06.902
you don't have a lot of options
right now.

18:06.952 --> 18:09.472
In fact, this whole situation
probably feels like...

18:09.512 --> 18:11.432
Like a twisted bowel,
but it's not.

18:11.472 --> 18:14.082
There's still one end
of this bowel that's open.

18:14.132 --> 18:16.262
Which end?

18:16.302 --> 18:19.702
- The butt end.
- I'm listening.

18:19.742 --> 18:21.962
Okay, if you hand me
that bomb right now,

18:22.012 --> 18:25.182
nothing bad will have happened,
and that'll be because of you,

18:25.232 --> 18:26.662
because you cooperated.

18:26.712 --> 18:29.402
Also, I'm sure a judge
would understand

18:29.452 --> 18:30.582
how you got into this situation.

18:30.622 --> 18:32.062
I mean, you were asked
to do this

18:32.102 --> 18:34.372
by an Antonio Banderas type.
Who could say no to that?

18:34.412 --> 18:36.412
And even if you do go to prison,

18:36.452 --> 18:38.672
it is gonna be
such a fancy prison.

18:38.722 --> 18:42.372
- With a lot of crafts?
- Yes, with tons of crafts.

18:42.422 --> 18:45.462
Pam, listen to me.

18:45.512 --> 18:48.342
Let's untwist this bowel together.

18:48.382 --> 18:52.172
Let's clear everything out.

18:56.262 --> 18:58.352
Okay.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.572
You did great, Pam.
Thank you.

19:02.612 --> 19:05.222
Now that it's out of my hands,
I can see it really is a bomb.

19:05.272 --> 19:06.352
Yes. Yes, it is.

19:06.402 --> 19:08.972
- Oh, my God, get some help!
- Okay.

19:11.972 --> 19:15.062
- You okay?
- Hey. Yeah, I'm okay.

19:17.152 --> 19:18.322
Really surprised by Pam.

19:18.372 --> 19:20.322
- I did not see that coming.
- Right?

19:20.372 --> 19:22.852
You should have seen the look on
my face when I saw it was her.

19:22.892 --> 19:24.682
Your jaw just dropped.

19:24.722 --> 19:25.942
- Oh, she's right there.
- Mm-hmm.

19:25.982 --> 19:28.552
Good-bye, Pam.
Good luck with everything.

19:28.592 --> 19:30.552
- Kind of liked her in the end.
- Yeah.

19:30.602 --> 19:34.082
- So did they defuse the bomb?
- Yeah, one of 'em.

19:34.122 --> 19:37.042
Oh, you didn't hear?
There was a second bomb.

19:37.082 --> 19:38.342
Ya butt.

19:38.392 --> 19:40.392
- Ya butt is da bomb.
- Aww.

19:40.432 --> 19:42.692
On our anniversary.

19:42.742 --> 19:44.612
Speaking of which,
I requested next week off

19:44.652 --> 19:48.702
so we can take an actual vacation...
to the water park.

19:48.742 --> 19:51.442
I've never been more in love
with you in my entire life.

19:51.492 --> 19:58.282
And hey, I've been thinking,
and I do want to have kids.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.932
With you.

20:00.972 --> 20:04.062
- You're not scared anymore?
- Oh, no, I am so scared.

20:04.112 --> 20:05.332
Maybe even more so than before,

20:05.372 --> 20:07.502
but I was scared in there
with Pam too,

20:07.552 --> 20:10.592
and you know, I didn't panic
or mess anything up there.

20:10.642 --> 20:13.292
If anything, I was sharper.
I was a freakin' debate genius.

20:13.332 --> 20:15.732
Debate genius?
Oh, that's very hot.

20:15.772 --> 20:18.772
Oh, that's an added bonus.
Okay, keep that energy up.

20:18.822 --> 20:22.132
But the point that I was
actually trying to make is,

20:22.172 --> 20:24.742
maybe it's a good thing
that I'm scared of fatherhood.

20:24.782 --> 20:28.172
You know? Maybe it'll turn me
into a freakin' dad genius.

20:31.482 --> 20:33.092
But we don't have to start
trying right away, right?

20:33.142 --> 20:35.962
I mean, I don't know
that I'm all the way there yet.

20:36.012 --> 20:37.922
No, of course not.

20:37.972 --> 20:40.842
Whenever we're both ready.
How do you know when that is?

20:40.882 --> 20:42.542
I guess we'll just
have to have another one

20:42.582 --> 20:45.282
of these really fun,
casual conversations.

20:45.322 --> 20:46.932
Cool. Love that.
Can't wait.

20:48.192 --> 20:50.892
- Can we go home now?
- Yes, please.

20:50.942 --> 20:54.112
Maybe we can grab some Thai food
and brainstorm baby names?

20:54.162 --> 20:55.592
Ooh, I like that.

20:55.642 --> 20:57.992
Now, I am a fan of the show
"American Gladiators."

20:58.032 --> 21:01.992
How do you feel about the name
Blaze Peralta?

21:02.032 --> 21:03.122
Not great.

21:03.172 --> 21:05.042
- What about Laser?
- No.

21:05.082 --> 21:06.042
- Nitro?
- No.

21:06.082 --> 21:07.042
- Viper?
- No.

21:07.082 --> 21:09.302
- Atlas?
- Ooh, I do love atlases.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.522
Mm, common ground.
