00:05.290 --> 00:06.630
My name is Bridget.

00:06.670 --> 00:07.920
I witnessed a murder.

00:07.960 --> 00:09.750
Just get up on the stand

00:09.800 --> 00:11.550
and tell the judge what you saw,
and we'll protect you.

00:11.590 --> 00:12.760
You don't get it.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.140
Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:15.180 --> 00:18.300
BRIDGET: I ran to my sister
Siobhan for help.

00:18.350 --> 00:20.810
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:20.850 --> 00:22.230
It was so easy.

00:22.270 --> 00:23.770
I saw a way out,
and I took it.

00:23.810 --> 00:25.900
They all think that I'm her.

00:25.940 --> 00:27.900
I did kill Tyler.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.770
We have a witness that puts
you in Tyler Barrett's room

00:29.820 --> 00:31.650
just before his death.

00:31.690 --> 00:34.360
I thought this might help
you see things more clearly.

I hated her,

00:44.870 --> 00:47.920
and I wanted to take everything
that mattered to her.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.880
Are you all right?

00:49.920 --> 00:52.380
Uhh. That was weird.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.920
I, um...head rush.

01:01.310 --> 01:02.930
[exhales sharply]

01:12.070 --> 01:14.990
That's not mine.

01:24.540 --> 01:25.830
BRIDGET:
I want you to know

01:25.870 --> 01:27.960
that if anything
happens to me

01:28.000 --> 01:29.960
or if your friend's
body is ever found,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.960
that FBI agent back
there gets this phone,

01:33.000 --> 01:35.260
which leads to you.

01:43.310 --> 01:45.980
Find what you're
looking for?

01:46.020 --> 01:47.850

01:47.890 --> 01:49.810
It's you.

I can't
believe it.

03:07.220 --> 03:10.060
Oh, I can't believe it.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.520
She and Andrew
seemed so happy.

03:26.990 --> 03:30.370
You're putting the house
in Miami on the market?

03:30.410 --> 03:32.080
I'm living there.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.460
Well, we'll give you
30 days to vacate
the premises.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.840
I'm glad you could
make it tonight.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.380
I definitely wanted
to be able to tell
you in person.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.510
You can't do
this to me.

03:41.550 --> 03:43.090
Andrew won't let you.

03:43.130 --> 03:44.640
Andrew
the ex-husband won't,

03:44.680 --> 03:46.970
but Andrew
the businessman will.

03:47.010 --> 03:49.020
This is my home.

03:49.060 --> 03:50.680
OK, where the hell
am I supposed to live?

03:50.730 --> 03:52.440
Spare me
the drama, Catherine.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.100
We both know that
you're never more

03:54.150 --> 03:56.150
than one disgusting sex act
away from shacking up

03:56.190 --> 03:58.690
with a new
sugar daddy.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.800
We'd love that--we were just
talking about going there.

04:21.840 --> 04:24.260
You must be so pleased
with yourself.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.050
Andrew just told me

04:26.090 --> 04:28.100
that you're sending Juliet
to boarding school.

04:28.140 --> 04:29.640
My apologies.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.390
Catherine, I think you've
had too much to drink.

04:31.430 --> 04:33.060
It's time
we call you a cab.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.140
I make the decisions
about Juliet, not you.

04:35.190 --> 04:36.810
She is my kid.

04:36.850 --> 04:39.190
Catherine, the last thing
that Juliet needs

04:39.230 --> 04:42.610
is a chemically dependent,
promiscuous part-time parent.

04:42.650 --> 04:45.610
You're not fit
to make decisions.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.830
I never want
to see you again,

04:51.870 --> 04:53.830

Siobhan was my mother.

Mrs. Martin,
Agent Machado.

06:05.110 --> 06:06.530

06:06.570 --> 06:08.650
I'm on my way to

Good afternoon, Kenny.

Right back at you,
Mrs. M.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.300
The phone.

06:26.670 --> 06:29.880
Uh, Kenny, I'm sorry.
I forgot something.

Agent Machado for Andrew Martin.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.680
SECRETARY: I'm sorry,
Agent Machado,

06:35.720 --> 06:37.180
but Mr. Martin left for lunch.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.730
-You try him on his cell?
-I can try right away.

06:38.770 --> 06:40.350
Is there a message?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.980
Yeah, just have him call me
as soon as he can.

06:42.020 --> 06:43.690
-It's urgent.
-OK.

didn't go as planned.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.880
What are you
talking about?

07:07.920 --> 07:10.300
-She eliminated my man.
-What?

07:10.340 --> 07:11.880
How the hell?

07:11.930 --> 07:13.890
I think we
underestimated her.

07:13.930 --> 07:16.060
Then send someone else.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.140
Finish the job
that I paid you to do.

07:18.180 --> 07:20.480
I can't. She recovered
his cell phone.

07:20.520 --> 07:21.980
If anything happens to her,

07:22.020 --> 07:24.190
she'll turn it over
to the Feds,

07:24.230 --> 07:27.190
and that would be bad
for both of us.

Oh, hi, Catherine. Do you
know where Siobhan is?

07:45.380 --> 07:47.000
Uh, yeah, she went out

07:47.040 --> 07:49.210
to pick up
a prescription for me.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.010
Did she say how long
she'd be gone?

07:51.050 --> 07:53.380
No, but I know that
she had other errands.

07:53.430 --> 07:55.640
Do you want me to give
her a message for you?

07:55.680 --> 07:57.220
No. No, this is important.

07:57.260 --> 07:58.970
I'll wait.
Maybe I'll catch her.

Hey, Siobh,
we need to talk.

08:07.860 --> 08:09.530
Tim Arbogast made me

08:09.570 --> 08:11.110
a rather curious
offer today.

08:11.150 --> 08:13.400
I think you'll be
interested.

08:13.450 --> 08:16.120
Please give me a ring.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.660
So are you sure you

08:17.700 --> 08:19.240
don't want me to give
her a message for you?

08:19.290 --> 08:21.500
I mean, if you have to
go back to the office.

08:21.540 --> 08:24.670
Maybe. But I need to
change my tie first.

08:24.710 --> 08:26.710

on it this morning.

08:26.750 --> 08:30.050
Well, let me
pick one out for you.

pick out my own tie.

Andrew. Wait.

08:40.140 --> 08:43.430
Catherine, why are you

out of my bedroom?

was off limits.

I-I'm sorry, Andrew.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.450
I just...

09:01.490 --> 09:03.450
It's OK.
I won't tell her.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.750
-You won't?
-No. But...

09:05.790 --> 09:07.460
please try to remember,

09:07.500 --> 09:09.420
Siobhan opened her heart
and her home to you.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.460
Don't abuse
her hospitality.

09:15.170 --> 09:17.430
You are too good
to me, Andrew.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.310
Let me be clear.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.440
I'm not siding
with you over Siobhan

09:31.480 --> 09:33.360
because I'm unhappy
in my marriage.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.700
Nor am I showing you
any special attention

09:36.740 --> 09:39.120
as a sign of my
feelings for you.

09:39.160 --> 09:42.200
This is a one-time courtesy.
Do you understand?

09:53.250 --> 09:55.460
Say you understand,
Catherine.

09:55.510 --> 09:57.510
I-I understand.

09:57.550 --> 09:59.220
Thank you.

10:02.010 --> 10:04.470
This is a tricky situation
with all of us living

10:04.520 --> 10:06.230
under the same roof, and...

10:10.770 --> 10:12.150
What the hell?

That's it. Siobh.

CATHERINE:
Oh, Andrew.

10:40.590 --> 10:44.060
I really wish
you wouldn't
have done that.

What?

10:53.440 --> 10:54.940
HENRY: But it's just
a few hours a week.

10:54.980 --> 10:56.900
I mean, why can't the judge
be reasonable?

10:59.700 --> 11:00.860
I-I have
my OB appointment.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.570
OK, fine, yeah.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.200
I'll-I'll wait to hear
from you.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.540
Well, my petition
for supervised visits

11:07.580 --> 11:09.410
with my twins was denied.

11:10.830 --> 11:12.830
Henry, I'm sorry.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.800
This is all gonna
be over soon,

11:15.840 --> 11:17.300
I promise.

11:17.340 --> 11:19.630
Siobhan...

11:19.670 --> 11:21.590
I haven't
done anything...

11:21.630 --> 11:23.680
except believe in you.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.010
Let's keep it that way.

11:25.050 --> 11:28.220
I don't need any
more trouble right now.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.230
What exactly did
the attorneys say?

11:30.270 --> 11:32.020
Well, outside
of the maid's testimony

11:32.060 --> 11:33.600
that she let me
into Tyler's room,

11:33.650 --> 11:36.230
there is no evidence
tying me to the murder.

11:36.270 --> 11:39.030
At least not yet.

11:39.070 --> 11:41.490
What?

11:41.530 --> 11:43.610
It's just people
have been convicted

11:43.660 --> 11:46.080
with far less evidence
than that.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.080
Henry, I don't
think we can leave
everything to chance.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.450
I mean, our future
together depends
on this.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.210
Just let my lawyers
do their job.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.800
ANDREW: Come on, Catherine.
This is insane.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.260
You're not gonna
get away with this.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.630
It was supposed
to look like a suicide.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.590
And it would
have worked, too,

12:05.640 --> 12:07.890
because everyone knows that
Siobhan Martin loves money

12:07.930 --> 12:09.930
more than life itself.

12:09.970 --> 12:11.980
And now I have
to try something different!

12:12.020 --> 12:14.810
And all because you had to come
home and ruin everything!

12:14.850 --> 12:16.730
Catherine, it's not
too late to put
the gun down.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.360
It was too late

12:18.400 --> 12:20.440
the minute you took queen
bitch here out of the tub!

12:20.480 --> 12:21.990
Think about Juliet.

12:22.030 --> 12:24.030
You don't want her
to come home to this.

12:24.070 --> 12:25.950
Oh, you think
that I don't know that?

12:25.990 --> 12:27.990
You know what?
I ought kill you right now

12:28.030 --> 12:30.040
for even pretending
to care about my daughter.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.500
I do care
about Juliet.

12:31.540 --> 12:33.250
Liar!

12:33.290 --> 12:35.420
I am the one who loves her!

12:35.460 --> 12:37.630
And that is why I have kept
her busy with errands all day,

12:37.670 --> 12:39.300
so she wouldn't have
to find your corpse!

12:39.340 --> 12:40.670
Catherine...

12:40.710 --> 12:43.880
Andrew, sit down.
Sit down!

12:43.920 --> 12:47.010
Or Juliet will be the least
of your worries.

12:56.350 --> 12:57.520
Hello?

12:57.560 --> 12:58.900
CATHERINE:
Angel, I need you to run

12:58.940 --> 13:00.520
a few more errands
before you come home.

13:00.570 --> 13:02.780
No, but I'm supposed to meet
Holland for gelato.

13:02.820 --> 13:05.200
-Do it afterwards, sweetheart.
-Really?

13:05.240 --> 13:06.410
Of course.

13:11.370 --> 13:14.040
Oh, come on. These fakes are
better than the real things.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.540
That's the problem.

13:15.580 --> 13:17.170
I need three passports

13:17.210 --> 13:19.130
that'll get flagged
by INS as counterfeit.

13:19.170 --> 13:21.090
You want me
to make you three passports

13:21.130 --> 13:23.210
that's gonna get your ass
thrown in jail?

13:23.260 --> 13:25.840
That's exactly
what I want.

13:31.140 --> 13:33.020
Could you just
send someone over to
the apartment, Torrance?

13:33.060 --> 13:34.230
Her life could be
in danger.

13:34.270 --> 13:35.600
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.100
You're like a human IED.

13:37.140 --> 13:38.730
Everywhere you go,
there's collateral damage.

13:38.770 --> 13:41.980
Look, let's talk about
why I had you picked up.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.610
What were you doing
in Rex Barton's house?

13:44.650 --> 13:45.990
My job.

13:46.030 --> 13:47.450
But you don't have a job.

13:47.490 --> 13:48.860
Just send someone over,
Torrance.

13:48.910 --> 13:50.120
You're suspended.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.330
The Bureau doesn't
take kindly

13:52.370 --> 13:54.700
to cowboy agents running
their own investigations,

13:54.750 --> 13:56.370
especially when
your illegal search makes

13:56.410 --> 13:57.710
any evidence inadmissible.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.580
What do you want
from me?

13:59.630 --> 14:01.170
You want me to say
I screwed up, Torrance?
I screwed up again.

14:01.210 --> 14:02.380
But I didn't go
in there expecting

14:02.420 --> 14:04.260
to find a body
in a freezer.

14:04.300 --> 14:08.720
Everyone is tired
of your interference,

14:08.760 --> 14:10.430
especially
the Regional Director.

14:10.470 --> 14:11.720
Which is why
she had me book you on

14:11.760 --> 14:13.600
the next flight back
to Wyoming.

14:13.640 --> 14:16.730
Best part is, if you
don't show up tomorrow,

14:16.770 --> 14:19.520
guess who gets
to arrest you.

14:21.610 --> 14:24.150
OK, fine. Just
promise me you'll
send someone over

14:24.190 --> 14:27.360
to Siobhan Martin's
apartment, I'll be
on that plane, I swear.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.200
What is it with you
and those sisters?

14:29.240 --> 14:31.200
Siobhan Martin
isn't safe

14:31.240 --> 14:33.700
anywhere near her
husband's ex-wife.

14:37.580 --> 14:39.160
Please.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.220
No sweaters!

14:49.260 --> 14:50.430
What is the matter
with you?!

14:50.470 --> 14:52.300
You are going to Cancun,
not Chicago.

14:52.340 --> 14:54.010
You need beach attire!

14:54.050 --> 14:55.850
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

14:55.890 --> 14:57.850
It needs to look
like you are.

14:57.890 --> 15:00.270
What are you
talking about?

15:00.310 --> 15:03.770
It's called
improvising, bitch!

15:03.810 --> 15:06.230
So, Siobhan comes home
unexpectedly

15:06.280 --> 15:08.820
and finds her husband
and ex-wife

15:08.860 --> 15:11.660
in bed, planning
to go away to Mexico.

15:11.700 --> 15:14.700
Gunplay ensues,
Andrew is shot dead,

15:14.740 --> 15:16.660
I am wounded,

15:16.700 --> 15:19.580
and sadly, Siobhan takes
her own life.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.870
And it is all so tragic.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.250
Just keep packing!

15:24.290 --> 15:25.960
You're not a killer,
Catherine.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.880
Though you have
left me no choice!

15:27.920 --> 15:29.260
BRIDGET: But you do
have a choice.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.720
You just need help.
We can get it for you.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.590
Just think about
doing it for Juliet.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.640
ANDREW: You just have
to put the gun down.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.470
[phone ringing]

15:47.690 --> 15:49.400
Answer it.

15:51.860 --> 15:54.620
Hello?

15:54.660 --> 15:56.910
Mr. Martin, there are
two federal agents
in the lobby

15:56.950 --> 15:58.830
asking to see you.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.620
I'm sending them up.

16:03.710 --> 16:05.290
OK, fine. Thanks.

16:07.630 --> 16:10.460
As I said, this comes
as quite a shock.

16:10.510 --> 16:12.340
I wish I could be
of more help,

16:12.380 --> 16:14.090
but Catherine bought
a plane ticket and left
for the airport.

16:14.130 --> 16:15.390
Mexico, you said?

16:15.430 --> 16:17.390
Yes, departing at 4:00.

16:17.430 --> 16:20.220
We'll have someone
intercept her
at the airport.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.850
In the meantime,
how do we contact
your wife?

16:21.890 --> 16:24.140
We'd like to make sure
she's OK.

16:24.190 --> 16:25.900
Yes, of course.

16:28.820 --> 16:30.690
-There you go.
-Thank you.

16:30.730 --> 16:31.900
[line ringing]

16:31.940 --> 16:33.320
BRIDGET: Hello?

16:33.360 --> 16:35.740
Mrs. Martin,
this is Agent Roy
with the FBI.

16:35.780 --> 16:38.080
I'm sitting in
your apartment
with your husband.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.450
Is everything OK?

16:39.490 --> 16:40.660
Yeah, everything's
fine.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.910
I'll let him
explain later.

16:41.950 --> 16:43.410
In the meanwhile,
can you confirm for me

16:43.460 --> 16:45.210
that you're not in
any immediate danger?

16:49.040 --> 16:51.710
No, I'm not
in any danger.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.670
OK, just
bear with me,
Mrs. Martin.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.130
The following is
Bureau protocol.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.930
If you're in danger
and can't say so,

16:56.970 --> 16:59.890
please signal it
by using a day of
the week in a sentence.

17:01.470 --> 17:04.180
This is silly.
I'm at Pilates.

17:04.230 --> 17:05.980
Thank you,
Mrs. Martin.

17:06.020 --> 17:07.860
Thank you.

17:12.940 --> 17:14.530
If Catherine Martin returns

17:14.570 --> 17:16.860
or calls you,
contact us immediately.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.160
ANDREW: I will. In fact,

17:18.200 --> 17:19.910
let me give you
my private office number

17:19.950 --> 17:22.950
just in case you have
any more questions.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.050
I tell you what.
Forget it.

17:34.090 --> 17:35.590
My cell's probably best.

17:35.630 --> 17:37.090
Thank you, sir.
We'll call you
as soon

17:37.130 --> 17:38.390
as she's apprehended
at the gate.

17:38.430 --> 17:39.600
Thank you.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.770
[elevator bell dings]

17:47.270 --> 17:49.400
[Siobhan gasps]

17:49.440 --> 17:51.940
You told them
about Mexico?

17:51.980 --> 17:53.360
Better that than think
you were in the bedroom

17:53.400 --> 17:54.570
with a gun to her head.

17:54.610 --> 17:58.610
Show me that card.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.120
[door buzzer sounds]

18:08.710 --> 18:10.920
You need to leave.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.840
Well, no wonder
my previous offer

18:12.880 --> 18:14.840
didn't persuade
you to recant.

18:14.880 --> 18:18.010
I based my generosity on
the salary of a hotel maid,

18:18.050 --> 18:19.590
not a high-priced call girl

18:19.640 --> 18:21.390
with a taste
for Fabergé eggs.

18:21.430 --> 18:23.060
I'm calling the police.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.970
Oh, good.
That would be perfect.

18:25.020 --> 18:28.020
I wonder what they'll
think of these.

18:28.060 --> 18:30.310
How many names
do you have?

18:37.070 --> 18:38.570
These aren't mine.

18:38.610 --> 18:40.450
So said the sad little
Russian call girl

18:40.490 --> 18:42.280
as she was deported
for identity fraud.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.490
That's right.
I did my digging.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.620
I know you've petitioned
for citizenship.

18:46.660 --> 18:48.540
I have every right
to apply.

18:48.580 --> 18:50.250
And what do
you think is gonna
happen to that right

18:50.290 --> 18:52.420
when those get turned
over to your caseworker?

18:52.460 --> 18:55.460
I'm guessing
your citizenship
will be denied

18:55.500 --> 18:57.460
and your green card
revoked.

18:57.510 --> 18:59.260
I bet you'll be
back in Leningrad

18:59.300 --> 19:00.840
for Tatiana Day

19:00.880 --> 19:03.510
unless you withdraw
your testimony

19:03.550 --> 19:05.220
against Henry Butler.

19:07.140 --> 19:08.600
ANDREW: The card
doesn't matter.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.390
They didn't see anything,

19:10.440 --> 19:12.480
because I couldn't risk
you hurting my wife.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.230
You can't keep this up.

19:14.270 --> 19:15.860
I said, show me
the card.

19:15.900 --> 19:17.570
JULIET: Mom?

19:17.610 --> 19:18.860
OK, what is going on?

19:18.900 --> 19:20.860
I know you hate
my friend Holland...

19:22.360 --> 19:23.910
[sighs]

19:23.950 --> 19:25.330
Dad, Siobhan,
what...?

19:25.370 --> 19:26.660
[Juliet gasps]

19:26.700 --> 19:30.120
Angel, I'm sorry.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.210
Give me the phone.

19:45.550 --> 19:48.060
CATHERINE:
Lock the elevator, Angel.

19:48.100 --> 19:51.520
ANDREW: Catherine, this
is enough! Think of Juliet.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.650
No more surprises.

19:57.650 --> 19:59.530
You're crazy.

19:59.570 --> 20:01.950
No, Juliet. Siobhan
deserves this.

20:01.990 --> 20:03.740
She destroyed
our family.

20:03.780 --> 20:06.530
You destroyed our family.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.740
Honey, that is
not true!

20:07.780 --> 20:09.540
The hell it's not!

20:09.580 --> 20:13.080
You never cared
about me or Dad!

20:13.120 --> 20:15.380
You only cared about
yourself!

20:15.420 --> 20:17.130
Don't say that!

20:17.170 --> 20:18.630
Catherine, enough!

20:21.380 --> 20:23.300
Oh, angel, I am sorry.

20:23.340 --> 20:25.090
Do not touch me!

20:35.850 --> 20:39.110
[dialing]

20:39.150 --> 20:42.150
[line ringing]

20:42.190 --> 20:44.280
Baby, it's me.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.450
You have to help me.

20:46.490 --> 20:50.330
I've made a mess
of everything.

20:57.130 --> 21:00.170
But I did it for you and me.
It's what we wanted.

21:00.210 --> 21:03.130
Why would you try and kill
Siobhan by yourself?

21:03.170 --> 21:05.630
It was one thing
someone else getting
their hands dirty,

21:05.680 --> 21:07.800
but now this is
traceable to us!

21:07.840 --> 21:09.390
After the second hit
attempt,

21:09.430 --> 21:11.390
you said, "Sit tight,"
so I did.

21:11.430 --> 21:14.140
But I didn't think
that meant you were
gonna take hostages!

21:14.180 --> 21:16.020
I know, I know.
We can fix this.

21:16.060 --> 21:18.770
How?! You've lost
your mind!

21:18.810 --> 21:20.570
Stop yelling at me!

21:20.610 --> 21:22.030
That was Olivia.

21:22.070 --> 21:24.530
Your Olivia
and Mama?

21:24.570 --> 21:26.530
CATHERINE: Please!

21:26.570 --> 21:30.160
[sobbing]:
Please...

21:30.200 --> 21:33.080
[phone ringing]

21:35.290 --> 21:37.170
Yeah.

21:37.210 --> 21:39.080
TORRANCE: Good news.
The Martins are fine.

21:39.130 --> 21:42.210
I had someone sent over, spoke
to Andrew and Siobhan directly.

21:42.250 --> 21:44.670
What about
the ex-wife?

21:44.720 --> 21:46.430
Turns out she's trying
to leave the country.

21:46.470 --> 21:48.010
We've dispatched agents
to all the airports.

21:48.050 --> 21:49.220
She won't get far.

21:49.260 --> 21:50.760
Where's she headed?

21:50.800 --> 21:52.220
Mexico.
Funny thing is,

21:52.260 --> 21:55.180
she booked a seat
for her ex-husband, too.

21:55.230 --> 21:58.190
What? When did she
buy the tickets?

21:58.230 --> 22:01.980
Machado, walk away.
We're on top of it.

22:04.110 --> 22:06.860
All right, I'll,
uh, I'll see you
in the morning.

22:06.900 --> 22:09.070
CATHERINE: That is not true.

22:09.110 --> 22:12.080
And I need you
to stop yelling at me.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.700
OLIVIA: Oh, spare me.

22:13.740 --> 22:15.750
Don't talk to
me like that.

22:15.790 --> 22:18.290
And you are blowing
everything out of proportion!

22:18.330 --> 22:19.960
Listen, you leave me
out of this.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.170
You're on your own now.

22:21.210 --> 22:23.170
How can you say that to me?

22:23.210 --> 22:26.550
I thought that we
understood each other.

22:26.590 --> 22:27.920
Come on, you're out!

22:27.970 --> 22:29.380
Hey, get your hand--
You're hurting me!

22:29.430 --> 22:30.590
In your state,

22:30.640 --> 22:32.050
I doubt you'll
feel a thing!

22:32.100 --> 22:33.890
You have no right to
treat Juliet like that!

22:33.930 --> 22:35.270
-I am her mother!
-No, not in this house!

22:35.310 --> 22:36.480
ANDREW: I want you out.

22:36.520 --> 22:37.770
And here.

22:37.810 --> 22:39.060
Here's some money
for a hotel.

22:39.100 --> 22:41.100
You'll get your bags
in the morning.

22:42.310 --> 22:45.070
[knocking]

22:47.440 --> 22:50.280
Andrew threw me out.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.530
I have nowhere else to go.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.660
Come on.

23:00.580 --> 23:03.920
[jazzy pop music playing]

23:03.960 --> 23:07.340
He humiliated me
in front of my daughter.

23:07.380 --> 23:09.260
Yeah, told me
that I wasn't welcome,

23:09.300 --> 23:11.430
like I am the problem,
when he is the bastard

23:11.470 --> 23:13.300
who cheated on me
with that whore.

23:13.350 --> 23:16.260
Well, he's an ass.

23:16.310 --> 23:17.470
[chuckles]

23:17.520 --> 23:18.850
He's a pompous douche bag.

23:18.890 --> 23:20.480
You know, he's...

23:20.520 --> 23:21.690
Your typical man.

23:26.860 --> 23:28.360
[whispers]

23:28.400 --> 23:31.110
Ha ha ha! Oh!

23:31.150 --> 23:33.320
No, it isn't.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.950
I'll never be able
to look Andrew

23:34.990 --> 23:37.330
in the face again.

23:37.370 --> 23:39.910
Ah, hell, it's not true.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.420
I wish it were.

23:41.460 --> 23:43.170
It would serve him right.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.750
I'm just tired of being
treated like a doormat

23:47.800 --> 23:49.760
by every guy that I meet.

23:51.510 --> 23:53.340
I get it.

23:53.390 --> 23:56.300
You want them to stop
trying to turn you

23:56.350 --> 23:58.680
into something
you're not.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.020
Ah, you see?

24:03.060 --> 24:06.020
No man can understand me
like a woman can.

24:10.030 --> 24:13.740
You know I always had
a crush on you, right?

24:16.830 --> 24:19.160
Yeah.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.120
[both laugh]

24:23.250 --> 24:25.750
Cheeky.

24:25.790 --> 24:28.750
I'm serious.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.130
When Andrew left you,
I thought he was making

24:32.170 --> 24:35.140
the biggest mistake
of his life.

24:35.180 --> 24:37.010
You're sweet.

24:38.890 --> 24:42.350
Too bad I have never
been into girls.

24:55.860 --> 24:59.030
This is not how you treat
someone you love.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.490
"Love"?

25:00.540 --> 25:01.830
JULIET:
Is Mom saying

25:01.870 --> 25:03.370
she and Olivia were
girlfriend-girlfriends?

25:03.410 --> 25:05.460
Juliet,
underneath the chair,

25:05.500 --> 25:06.880
there's a cell phone.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.630
Can you get to it
without your mom seeing you?

25:08.670 --> 25:10.670
-It's OK. She's not out.
-OK.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.590
CATHERINE: Well, I expected
more from you.

25:12.630 --> 25:15.430
And you promised
me more.

25:15.470 --> 25:17.390
You're just
like the rest.

25:17.430 --> 25:20.390
All you care about
is yourself.

25:20.430 --> 25:21.600
[sniffles]

25:21.640 --> 25:23.390
I'm nothing to you.

25:23.430 --> 25:25.270
Just another doormat.

25:25.310 --> 25:26.850
OLIVIA: Oh, you're
so dramatic.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.770
Oh, no, don't you dare.
Don't you dare.

25:28.810 --> 25:31.690
'Cause you want drama,
I will give you drama.

25:33.150 --> 25:34.320
[phone beeps off]

25:36.450 --> 25:39.410
Hello? Hello?

25:39.450 --> 25:40.620
[sniffles]

25:48.120 --> 25:50.500
It's OK, Mama. It's OK.

25:50.540 --> 25:52.420
Everything's gonna be fine.

25:52.460 --> 25:56.380
[cell phone ringing]

25:56.420 --> 25:58.590
BRIDGET: Catherine, why
don't you put that gun down.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.430
You can't keep us
here forever.

26:00.470 --> 26:02.310
Someone's going to figure
out we're being held

26:02.350 --> 26:04.390
against our will
in our own apartment.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.390
BRIDGET: I can't believe
you're being so oblivious.

26:09.770 --> 26:12.440
Olivia Charles
doesn't care about
anyone but herself.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.440
You know, you don't
even know what you're
talking about.

26:14.480 --> 26:15.990
Olivia has nothing
to do with this.

26:16.030 --> 26:18.200
ANDREW: That was her
voice on your phone.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.950
I'd recognize it anywhere.

26:19.990 --> 26:22.910
So what if it was?
You'll be dead soon.

26:22.950 --> 26:24.740
Mama, please.

26:24.790 --> 26:26.500
You don't even know
where Olivia is.

26:26.540 --> 26:29.670
-Of course I do.
-You're lying.

26:29.710 --> 26:32.380
Olivia would never
trust her wellbeing
to someone like you.

26:32.420 --> 26:36.050
You know, the only
reason that Olivia is
safe is because of me.

26:36.090 --> 26:38.470
I put her up at my sister's
rental property.

26:38.510 --> 26:40.050
In Saddle Rock?

26:40.090 --> 26:41.600
CATHERINE:
Yeah, so what does that matter?

26:41.640 --> 26:43.180
BRIDGET:
She's manipulating you.

26:43.220 --> 26:44.970
I bet she's been doing it
from the beginning.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.940
That is one of
the things that I hate
about you, Siobhan.

26:51.980 --> 26:54.400
You are such
a know-it-all.

26:54.440 --> 26:57.440
You don't know the first
thing about us.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.360
-A Ponzi scheme?
-Yeah.

26:59.400 --> 27:00.860
You could go to jail.

27:00.910 --> 27:03.070
Yeah, I know.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.950
It was only supposed to be
a temporary measure,

27:04.990 --> 27:06.540
but then Siobhan found out

27:06.580 --> 27:09.540
and threatened
to expose Andrew.

27:13.540 --> 27:16.760
I wish I could just blink
and make her disappear.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.970
I know it's
a horrible thing to say,

27:19.010 --> 27:20.970
but I'd pay good money

27:21.010 --> 27:23.680
to see her eaten
by a pack of wolves.

27:23.720 --> 27:25.760
I know how you feel.

27:28.140 --> 27:30.520
So you should.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.400
The woman stole
your husband.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.730
[sighs]

27:34.770 --> 27:37.730
So I did something
about it.

27:39.690 --> 27:41.400
What do you mean?

27:43.660 --> 27:46.870
I paid a guy...

27:46.910 --> 27:48.580
to kill her.

27:57.460 --> 27:59.510
Are you serious?

28:02.840 --> 28:05.220
I hired a guy.

28:05.260 --> 28:07.430
And then the bitch
killed him.

28:10.270 --> 28:11.890
Siobhan Martin

28:11.940 --> 28:15.310
offed a hit man?

28:15.360 --> 28:16.900
Yeah, and then she

28:16.940 --> 28:18.480
got her hands
on his cell phone.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.860
And she threatened
to give it to the Feds

28:20.900 --> 28:23.030
if anyone tried
to finish the job.

28:27.280 --> 28:31.160
I, um, I don't know
what to say.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.040
Look, I know
it is crazy.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.420
But Siobhan took
everything from me.

28:36.460 --> 28:37.920
She ruined my life.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.590
I mean,
how was I supposed

28:39.630 --> 28:41.260
to let her
get away with that?

28:43.300 --> 28:45.680
Thank God
it didn't go down.

28:45.720 --> 28:49.600
It was
an awful mistake.

28:54.390 --> 28:56.860
The only mistake
you made

28:56.900 --> 28:59.940
was not getting
that cell phone back.

29:04.700 --> 29:06.660
You don't
have a clue.

29:08.660 --> 29:11.240
If I change my story now,
there might be questions.

29:11.290 --> 29:13.000
Questions about my life.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.750
Questions
I can't answer.

29:14.790 --> 29:16.370
You're making a very big
mistake, little girl.

29:16.420 --> 29:18.330
[knocking]
Chyort.

29:18.380 --> 29:19.540
-Excuse me...
-Come.

29:19.590 --> 29:20.920
SIOBHAN: Where?
MAN: Oksana?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.130
Stop talking.
[speaks Russian]

29:22.170 --> 29:23.920
Are you joking?

29:23.970 --> 29:26.260
Are you... you're
joking, aren't you?

29:26.300 --> 29:29.720
Don't make a sound.

29:33.850 --> 29:37.520
Ah, I found you.

29:37.560 --> 29:39.060
[chuckles]

29:39.110 --> 29:40.270
And now...

29:40.320 --> 29:42.530
I want you.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.950
Slow down, baby.

29:47.990 --> 29:51.490
Let's go upstairs,

29:51.530 --> 29:54.330
have a glass of wine.

29:54.370 --> 29:56.960
You know what?

29:57.000 --> 29:59.670
[grunts]

29:59.710 --> 30:03.130
I think I have
something...

30:03.170 --> 30:05.380
a little better.

30:05.420 --> 30:06.590
Hmm?

30:08.510 --> 30:10.390
[sniffs sharply, sighs]

30:10.430 --> 30:11.600
[clears throat]

30:11.640 --> 30:13.930
There you go.

30:13.970 --> 30:16.270
Your turn.

30:16.310 --> 30:17.940
[sniffs sharply]

30:21.770 --> 30:22.940
[sighs]

30:22.980 --> 30:24.900
Where were we?

30:33.620 --> 30:34.950
[man grunts]

30:45.300 --> 30:47.420
[panting]

30:53.760 --> 30:55.520
[panting]

31:01.020 --> 31:04.610
[sighs]

31:04.650 --> 31:06.360
[man sniffs sharply]

31:06.400 --> 31:07.990
[sighs]

31:10.570 --> 31:12.780
Here you go, baby.
Come on.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.370
[sniffs sharply]

31:17.410 --> 31:19.000
[gasps]

31:19.040 --> 31:20.870
Hey, you OK?

31:20.920 --> 31:23.000
Wait. Wait, wait.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.920
Hey.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.550
Oksana, are you
all right?!

31:26.590 --> 31:27.800
Hey! Hey.

31:27.840 --> 31:30.170
Come on. Oksana!

31:30.220 --> 31:31.760
Come on. Don't do
this to me!

31:31.800 --> 31:33.010
Oksana!

31:33.050 --> 31:34.930
Hey! Hey!
Don't do this to me!

31:34.970 --> 31:37.720
Oksana!

31:37.770 --> 31:40.140
Come on. Come on.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.900
[panting]

32:10.760 --> 32:11.930
I'm in labor.

32:11.970 --> 32:14.640
I need to get
to the hospital.

32:14.680 --> 32:15.850
OLIVIA [recorded]:
...Olivia Charles.

32:15.890 --> 32:17.430
Please leave a message.

32:17.470 --> 32:19.470
Pick up the phone.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.940
I don't know
what to do anymore.

32:22.980 --> 32:25.100
The FBI are watching
the airports

32:25.150 --> 32:27.270
and the train stations.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.690
I can't just leave.

32:29.730 --> 32:32.950
Not without
hearing your voice.

32:32.990 --> 32:35.320
Please pick up.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.080
ANDREW:
We have to act now.

32:40.120 --> 32:43.080
We have no way of knowing if
Machado heard any of this.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.250
Don't make me end it all.

32:45.290 --> 32:46.580
Because I will.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.210
ANDREW:
I love you both...

32:50.250 --> 32:51.420
very much.

32:53.050 --> 32:55.760
-What are you doing?
-I want to cut a deal.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.010
Take me into the other room,
and we can talk in private.

32:58.050 --> 32:59.640
Andrew, no!

32:59.680 --> 33:02.140
[cell phone ringing]

33:02.180 --> 33:03.810
Sit down, Andrew.

33:03.850 --> 33:05.140
-Sit down!
-Mom!

33:05.190 --> 33:07.520
-Sit down!
-Mom!

33:09.440 --> 33:11.030
[phone beeps on]

33:11.070 --> 33:12.820
Hi. Where have you been?

33:12.860 --> 33:15.110
Listen, I'm sorry for
the way I reacted earlier.

33:15.150 --> 33:18.830
I... I just don't want you
to hurt yourself.

33:18.870 --> 33:20.120
I love you.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.160
Oh, I love you, too, baby.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.870
OLIVIA: I need you to
come to me directly.

33:24.910 --> 33:26.120
Leave now.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.880
CATHERINE: I will.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.920
But I have something
that I have to do first.

33:32.590 --> 33:34.550
Remember what I promised you
that night?

33:34.590 --> 33:35.760
You're not listening!

33:35.800 --> 33:37.340
CATHERINE:
Olivia, please.

33:37.390 --> 33:38.850
Siobhan's going to blow
the lid off everything.

33:38.890 --> 33:40.680
CATHERINE: It'll be fine.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.930
I need to get out
of town while there's
still a chance.

33:42.970 --> 33:44.890
CATHERINE: I promise you,
I can take care of this.

33:44.930 --> 33:47.150
It's over
for Martin/Charles.

33:47.190 --> 33:49.190
There's nothing you can do.

33:49.230 --> 33:51.150
CATHERINE: I have
the hit man's cell phone.

33:51.190 --> 33:52.860
Siobhan will be dead
by tonight.

33:52.900 --> 33:55.740
[phone beeps off]

33:55.780 --> 33:58.700
I am going to kill Siobhan.

33:58.740 --> 33:59.910
[gasps]

34:01.620 --> 34:03.830
Mommy, please,
just-just-just leave!

34:03.870 --> 34:05.370
OLIVIA: She's
right, Catherine.

34:05.410 --> 34:06.870
It's too late
to kill Siobhan now.

34:06.910 --> 34:08.420
Your only choice is to run.

34:08.460 --> 34:09.920
CATHERINE: I can't run!

34:09.960 --> 34:11.540
The police are looking
for me everywhere.

34:11.590 --> 34:12.750
Then take me
with you.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.800
I'll be
your hostage.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.010
Siobhan...

34:16.050 --> 34:17.720
It's the only way
I know

34:17.760 --> 34:20.010
that you and Juliet
will be safe.

34:20.050 --> 34:21.220
CATHERINE: Juliet...
JULIET: No.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.850
-Cut her loose.
-No.

34:22.890 --> 34:24.390
-Cut her loose!
-No!

34:24.430 --> 34:26.100
You're not doing this,
Siobhan, I forbid it.

34:26.140 --> 34:27.730
If you're going to take
anyone, you take me.

34:27.770 --> 34:29.600
You? I don't
want you, Andrew.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.560
Or that paperweight
that you're planning
to bludgeon me with.

34:31.610 --> 34:32.770
Cut her loose!

34:32.820 --> 34:33.980
JULIET: Stop!

34:34.030 --> 34:35.820
If anything
happens to Siobhan,

34:35.860 --> 34:37.360
I swear I will
hunt you down.

34:37.400 --> 34:40.240
Oh, save it for
someone who cares.

34:42.030 --> 34:43.950
Baby, we're
on our way.

34:43.990 --> 34:46.200
OK. I'll see you soon.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.290
[phone beeps off]

34:51.330 --> 34:53.130
That's good.

34:53.170 --> 34:55.130
You're doing
the right thing.

35:03.260 --> 35:05.770
Watch your back.

35:05.810 --> 35:07.890
Doctor! Wait!

35:07.930 --> 35:09.230
You can't go any further.

35:09.270 --> 35:10.940
-But I'm the father.
-I understand.

35:10.980 --> 35:13.230
But we're prepping for an
emergency C-section right now.

35:13.270 --> 35:14.650
Are they going to be
all right?

35:14.690 --> 35:16.320
I'll let you know how
everyone's doing

35:16.360 --> 35:17.530
as soon as I can.

35:17.570 --> 35:19.740
[breathing hard]

35:19.780 --> 35:22.490
Why didn't you just send
the Feds to the apartment?

35:25.950 --> 35:30.410
Well, 31% of all
multiple hostage situations

35:30.460 --> 35:32.250
ends with at least one of
the hostages being shot.

35:32.290 --> 35:33.880
And that number doubles

35:33.920 --> 35:35.710
when there's a juvenile
involved, so...

35:35.750 --> 35:37.460
I think doing it this way

35:37.510 --> 35:39.090
just puts the odds back
in my favor.

35:39.130 --> 35:40.340
Why, what do you think?

35:40.380 --> 35:41.930
[car pulls up]

35:41.970 --> 35:43.930
There we go.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.890
I think you don't know
Catherine Martin very well.

35:49.930 --> 35:52.690
Go on.
Just act natural.

35:55.150 --> 35:56.480
Let me state the obvious.

35:56.520 --> 35:59.070
You give me a reason
to shoot you, I will.

35:59.110 --> 36:00.440
BRIDGET:
Catherine, there's a better
way we can solve this...

36:00.490 --> 36:01.900
CATHERINE: Olivia.

36:01.950 --> 36:03.160
You made it!

36:03.200 --> 36:05.660
Baby, I missed you.

36:05.700 --> 36:07.830
I missed you, too, honey.

36:07.870 --> 36:09.580

Hey!

36:09.620 --> 36:13.080
Hey! Olivia!
Grab her!

36:15.330 --> 36:17.670
FBI! Drop it!
Drop it!

36:17.710 --> 36:19.460
Ah...

36:19.510 --> 36:20.970
I gave you everything!

36:21.010 --> 36:22.590
No!

36:28.600 --> 36:29.930
Don't move!

36:35.190 --> 36:36.730
Catherine, stop!

36:38.150 --> 36:40.860
I mean it. It's over.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.490
You don't have it
in you.

36:52.910 --> 36:55.830
She might not,
but I do. Hands up.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.500
Up. Behind
your head.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.890
[handcuffs clicking]

37:05.930 --> 37:07.260
Hey, uh...any news?

37:07.300 --> 37:09.220
Not yet.
They're still in surgery.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.600
Hi.

37:14.350 --> 37:15.850
[phone beeps on]

37:33.580 --> 37:35.210
-Hi.
-Hi.

37:37.420 --> 37:40.420
You did great.

37:40.460 --> 37:42.170
The girls are so beautiful.

37:42.210 --> 37:44.090
The doctor said...

37:44.130 --> 37:46.260
That they're going to
be OK.

37:46.300 --> 37:49.300
We're all going
to be OK.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.640
The maid that was
going to testify...

37:51.680 --> 37:55.100
she... she was found dead.

37:57.140 --> 37:59.270
Do you know anything
about that?

38:01.520 --> 38:04.440
No. What happened?

38:06.650 --> 38:08.200
Never mind.

38:08.240 --> 38:10.070
It's not important.

38:10.120 --> 38:11.830
You need to get some rest.

38:11.870 --> 38:13.200
Mr. Butler?

38:13.240 --> 38:14.620
-I'll be right back.
-Wait. Henry...

38:17.960 --> 38:19.420
I love you.

38:22.710 --> 38:24.210
I love you, too.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.010
You asked to see me.

38:31.050 --> 38:33.390
Yeah.

38:33.430 --> 38:35.640
I want
a paternity test.

38:42.730 --> 38:44.360
Sorry.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.860
I thought I could
shoot her, but I...

38:46.900 --> 38:48.400
couldn't do it to Juliet.

38:48.450 --> 38:50.030
Got nothing to
apologize for.

38:50.070 --> 38:51.660
When you can
kill somebody
and not care?

38:51.700 --> 38:53.120
That's when you got
something to be
sorry about.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.580
CATHERINE:
You make me sick.

38:54.620 --> 38:56.040
What, you really think
that you're a saint

38:56.080 --> 38:57.250
'cause you couldn't
pull the trigger?

38:57.290 --> 38:58.460
-That's enough.
-You know what?

38:58.500 --> 38:59.670
You stole my husband.

38:59.710 --> 39:01.250
You turned my daughter
against me.

39:01.290 --> 39:02.460
You even tried to sell
my house out from under me.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.090
I mean, whose life
is so pathetic

39:04.130 --> 39:06.340
that they have to live
someone else's to be happy?

39:06.380 --> 39:08.590
That's it.
It's over.
