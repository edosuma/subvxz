WEBVTT

00:31.156 --> 00:32.615
Come on, boys! Let's go. Hike!

00:35.785 --> 00:37.912
Let's go! Hike!

00:48.631 --> 00:50.258
Let's go! Hike!

00:57.849 --> 00:58.892
Let's go, Curly.

00:58.975 --> 00:59.976
Attaboy!

01:09.527 --> 01:11.112
That's it, Curly. Hike!

01:15.075 --> 01:17.077
Yeah!

01:28.296 --> 01:30.048
That's a good boy.

01:31.883 --> 01:34.552
Yeah!

01:34.636 --> 01:36.513
Okay, let's go, boy!

01:37.680 --> 01:40.058
Come on, now! We gotta race now!

01:43.728 --> 01:45.271
We gotta race!

01:45.772 --> 01:46.898
Let's catch 'em.

01:46.981 --> 01:49.651
Come on, boys! Yeah!

01:56.533 --> 01:57.617
That's it.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.910
Come on, Curly!

02:19.097 --> 02:21.182
Come on, Curly! Let's get there first!

02:21.474 --> 02:22.642
Let's beat 'em!

02:25.395 --> 02:29.232
Let's go! Come on, boys! Come on!

02:31.109 --> 02:33.653
Come on! We gotta beat this train!

02:39.159 --> 02:41.536
All right, we got 'im, now! We got 'im!

02:41.619 --> 02:44.747
Come on! Almost there! Come on!

02:45.874 --> 02:49.502
Yeah! All right!

02:49.752 --> 02:50.795
Here you go.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.637
Watch it! Look out!

02:59.721 --> 03:01.180
Curly...

03:11.316 --> 03:13.484
-Will, that was incredible!
-Incredibly foolish.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.403
You could have been killed, Will Stoneman.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.323
Well, how many times is there an
army truck in the middle of the street?

03:18.406 --> 03:20.074
I've been comin' around this corner
my whole life.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.410
Has there ever been an army truck
in the middle of the street?

03:23.578 --> 03:25.038
Nice piece of runnin' there.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.957
-So, how old are you, pal?
-Seventeen.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.667
Think you'll be ready to
fight a war in a year?

03:29.751 --> 03:31.002
I'm ready now.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.463
War with who?

03:36.466 --> 03:39.302
Stay alive, buddy.
Your country might need ya.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.900
-Comin' on the run tomorrow?
-I ain't comin'.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.069
What? We planned it. You gotta come.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.320
I can't.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.404
You know my father.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.615
Yeah. Tell me something, Ward,
you gonna do something

04:00.698 --> 04:02.909
besides work for your father
your whole life?

04:03.117 --> 04:04.410
Please, Will.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.537
Just 'cause you want some thing
doesn't mean it's gonna happen.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.539
I know, but you can try, can't you?

04:08.623 --> 04:11.626
Ward! Get back to the dock.

04:13.878 --> 04:17.298
The train is on time, Mr. Stoneman,
and you are once again late.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.423
Yeah, I got... It was a--

04:18.507 --> 04:20.134
If you're late again, you're fired.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.268
-What are you so riled about?
-Old man Burton.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.477
He's always got something to say.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.771
Next time he opens his mouth,
I swear, I'll knock his teeth in.

04:31.854 --> 04:35.191
Don't waste your time worrying about
the Burtons in this world, son.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.278
They're too scared of living
to see past their own faces.

04:38.528 --> 04:42.073
Besides, there's too damn many
of them anyway.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.951
One day you'll make him eat his own words.

04:45.034 --> 04:48.329
-You think?
-Not a doubt in my mind.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.497
There you go.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.166
Come on. I'll help you sort the mail.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.924
Let's see. Milkson, Sorrenson...

05:00.008 --> 05:03.303
Jensen, Wilkerson and Zeider.

05:03.386 --> 05:06.014
Yep. That's it for...

05:06.097 --> 05:08.641
-What have you got there?
-It's just a letter.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.876
Is that the college?

05:37.420 --> 05:40.339
Well, did you get in?

05:41.215 --> 05:42.425
Yes, sir.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.095
You got in! I'm so proud of you!

05:46.179 --> 05:47.263
I'm not goin', Dad.

05:47.346 --> 05:49.891
-What?
-I'm not goin'.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.184
What are you talking about? Of course--

05:51.267 --> 05:55.563
Listen. I know how bad you and Mom
want this for me, but it's just dreams.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.316
-My place is here.
-Listen, listen. Listen to me.

05:58.399 --> 06:02.236
Your place is where your dreams are.
Now, you never forget that. Never.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.113
The money, Dad? What about the money?

06:04.197 --> 06:06.908
Don't worry about the money!
Look. When you need it, it'll be there.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.201
That's a promise.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.205
Come on. Let's go tell your mom.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.289
All right.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.257
-Come on, Will.
-I'm here.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.301
Let's go, boy!

06:29.388 --> 06:32.100
Come on, Will. Whoa, boy.

06:32.183 --> 06:35.186
-Tika.
-Easy, now. Easy.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.563
Slow up, now. Slow up.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.693
-Good boy.
-Good dog!

06:42.777 --> 06:45.321
Hey, Ned. Good dog, yes.

06:45.404 --> 06:47.323
Come here, Gus. How ya doin'?

06:47.406 --> 06:50.660
You're my dog, aren't ya? You're my dog.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.956
Hey, Gus, good dog. Good dog. You a good--

06:55.706 --> 06:57.750
What? What is so funny?

06:57.834 --> 06:59.418
-He bit me!
-Bite him back.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.546
-Bite him back?
-He knows one master.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.631
When he respects you as he does
your father, then he'll like you.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.929
Good dog, Curly. Good dog.

07:10.012 --> 07:12.056
Such a good dog.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.391
Yes, you are.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.688
That's a good dog.

07:19.021 --> 07:21.858
"Winnipeg to St. Paul Carnival Dog Derby."

07:21.941 --> 07:24.861
Listen to this, Ned. "JW Harper announces

07:24.944 --> 07:27.029
the longest, toughest, richest race

07:27.113 --> 07:29.073
in the history of dog sledding

07:29.157 --> 07:32.827
-with a first prize of $10,000."
-Ten thousand dollars?

07:32.910 --> 07:35.163
Yeah. "The race will run
from Winnipeg, Canada,

07:35.246 --> 07:38.249
to St. Paul, Minnesota, 500 miles."

07:39.125 --> 07:41.377
Ten thousand dollars for 500 miles.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.171
Not thinking of doing that, are you, Jack?

07:43.254 --> 07:45.465
-No, of course not.
-You should do it, Dad.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.300
-He'd never make it.
-Why do you say that?

07:47.383 --> 07:48.426
He's too old.

07:48.509 --> 07:49.510
He smokes too much.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.929
No, now, Ned. It's just because
I don't want it bad enough.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.892
Besides, everything I want is right here.

07:56.767 --> 07:57.727
Dad?

07:58.769 --> 08:00.146
That's the way I feel, too.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.816
Look, son...

08:04.901 --> 08:07.111
if you want something real bad...

08:07.195 --> 08:09.614
I mean, you really want it...

08:09.697 --> 08:12.325
You've gotta go out where
you can find it and grab it.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.080
Everybody's probably thinking
I'm just a big talker anyway.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.125
You know, wouldn't last
ten minutes away from the farm.

08:21.459 --> 08:27.006
Actually, we were wondering
how the farm would last without you.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.846
Don't let fear stand
in the way of your dream, son.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.810
Attaboy! Come on.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.441
-Go! Pull, Gus! Pull!
-That's it, Curly.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.263
Pull, Gus! Will!

09:58.973 --> 10:00.433
Will, I'm caught!

10:01.684 --> 10:05.605
Pull, Gus! Pull! Will!

10:08.065 --> 10:11.027
Dad! No, Dad! Don't let go!

10:11.110 --> 10:13.279
Dad, no, no, no, no! I'm here!

10:13.613 --> 10:15.573
-Dad, don't let go!
-Will, get back!

10:15.656 --> 10:17.491
-Gus, pull!
-You're being pulled in!

10:17.908 --> 10:20.703
No! Dad, hold on!

10:20.911 --> 10:21.912
Dad!

10:23.331 --> 10:24.707
Get back! You're coming in!

10:24.790 --> 10:26.417
No, no, no! Don't cut it, Dad!

10:26.500 --> 10:29.211
No! Dad!

10:29.879 --> 10:32.840
No!

11:46.539 --> 11:48.791
He's not coming back, Gus.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.211
He left us both.

11:55.589 --> 11:58.050
Damn you, Dad.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.603
I guess it's you and me now, Gus.

12:10.104 --> 12:14.525
What? Why didn't you pull him out? Why?

12:14.608 --> 12:17.027
You're his dog.
There was a whole team of you.

12:17.361 --> 12:20.156
You wanna fight, huh? You wanna fight?
You think I'm scared?

12:20.239 --> 12:21.532
-You think I'm--
-Don't!

12:28.706 --> 12:29.790
It's not his fault.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.042
It's not your fault either.

12:33.335 --> 12:37.298
The river called his name.
No other reason.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.884
The river called his name.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.845
-He's gone, Ned.
-No.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.097
No, he's with you forever.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.911
I've contacted most of the customers.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.205
-His dogs?
-Yeah.

13:10.039 --> 13:14.585
Listen. I'll help you work out
a plan, but, Mrs. Stoneman...

13:15.211 --> 13:17.087
You're going to have to
think about the farm.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.310
What you whistlin'?

13:33.312 --> 13:35.022
I wasn't whistling anything.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.233
It was your father's tune.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.903
'Cept I can't do it like he did.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.489
Maybe you'll find your own way.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.705
I'm sorry, Will.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.765
I've watched him, Mom.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.978
I've worked with him.
I can fill these orders.

14:16.855 --> 14:20.401
It's furniture, Mom.
It's tables and chairs and couches.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.778
It wasn't only that.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.780
It was your father's touch.

14:25.030 --> 14:28.367
Ned can help. He watches everything.
He knows Dad's work.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.452
Will...

14:31.745 --> 14:34.164
I'm arranging to sell the dogs.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.834
We'll be able to pay off
most of our debts...

14:36.917 --> 14:39.420
-The immediate ones anyway.
-You can't do that, Mom.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.171
The money we could get for Gus alone--

14:41.255 --> 14:44.633
-Gus? Gus is Dad's dog!
-And you're his son!

14:46.552 --> 14:50.556
And he wanted to pay for college
because it was important to you.

14:50.639 --> 14:52.308
Well, maybe it's not so important anymore.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.184
Maybe it never should have been important.

14:57.479 --> 15:00.149
Maybe I wasn't meant to go.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.933
Down, Gus.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.338
Mom!

16:50.300 --> 16:52.886
-Mom, he was gonna enter the race.
-What?

16:52.970 --> 16:55.097
Winnipeg to St. Paul, 500 miles, Mom.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.225
Will, he was thinking of entering
the race. There's a difference.

16:58.308 --> 17:02.396
Yeah, but this was his solution,
and it still can be, Mom. $10,000!

17:02.479 --> 17:04.940
That pays for the farm and college.
And people to help while I'm gone, Mom.

17:05.023 --> 17:05.858
Will, those men entering the race...

17:05.941 --> 17:07.483
They're younger than your father was
and stronger.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.111
He couldn't possibly have won,

17:09.194 --> 17:11.613
-and neither can you.
-But I can, Mom. I can!

17:11.696 --> 17:14.825
I just lost a husband. I won't lose a son!

17:17.243 --> 17:20.204
But who said anything about losing, Mom?

17:20.539 --> 17:22.750
Ned. Ned, you've seen me race.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.084
Tell her I can do it.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.377
I taught Jack for years.
Even he couldn't run this race.

17:26.462 --> 17:29.089
-You heard him say it.
-Well, he didn't want it bad enough!

17:29.381 --> 17:31.592
Listen to me, Ned. Since Dad died,

17:31.675 --> 17:34.845
I felt my whole life was finished,
you know, no more dreams.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.098
We're barely making enough to survive,
with no hope for anything better.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.434
I couldn't dream anymore about school.

17:40.517 --> 17:44.104
But when I saw this flier,
I felt life getting back into me.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.565
The race is in a month. You're not ready.

17:46.648 --> 17:49.026
-Yeah, but you can get me ready!
-Not in a month.

17:51.195 --> 17:54.406
Mom. Mom?

17:55.949 --> 17:59.536
I wanna feel alive.
I wanna feel like Dad's alive...

17:59.620 --> 18:00.913
Right here.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.082
And I don't.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.626
I don't.

18:08.837 --> 18:12.174
Mom, he was gonna do this for me.

18:12.382 --> 18:14.551
Now, let me do it for him.

18:53.924 --> 18:57.594
Just tell me one thing...

18:57.678 --> 18:59.471
Is it possible?

19:02.099 --> 19:03.225
Let's go, Will.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.769
What are you doing?

19:06.186 --> 19:09.773
Ned, what are you... Ned!

19:09.857 --> 19:12.276
What are you doing? Ned!

19:15.821 --> 19:18.782
-Ned!
-Training begins now.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.827
Ned? Ned, it's cold!

19:21.910 --> 19:24.079
Ned!

19:25.372 --> 19:27.875
Mom!

19:28.584 --> 19:30.711
Mom! Mom, please, it's cold!

19:30.794 --> 19:34.923
Mom! Mom, it's cold! Mom!

19:45.601 --> 19:46.685
Hi, guys.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.229
Fellas.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.910
The first few days, you sleep five hours.

20:02.993 --> 20:08.081
Then four, then three, then two.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.876
The last day you don't sleep.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.669
You just run.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.630
Run to the end.

20:17.841 --> 20:21.470
You have to be strong.
You have to learn focus,

20:21.553 --> 20:24.848
stamina and balance.

20:24.932 --> 20:28.602
Only the smart ones will finish.
You have to run longer and sleep less.

20:28.685 --> 20:29.645
It's your only chance.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.812
-Run longer!
-Yeah!

20:30.896 --> 20:32.105
-Sleep less!
-Sleep less!

20:32.189 --> 20:33.482
You'll make friends who aren't friends.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.775
You'll make enemies who wanna hurt you.

20:34.858 --> 20:35.692
Be careful who you trust.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.612
-How do I know who to trust?
-Trust the dogs.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.447
Get... Hey!

20:42.115 --> 20:43.450
Can't I just use Curly?

20:43.533 --> 20:45.953
-Gus is a champion.
-Yeah, but Gus doesn't respect me.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.215
You have one chance. You must run
at night when the others have stopped.

20:58.298 --> 21:01.009
Run with the moon. Embrace the darkness.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.219
Grow hard with the cold.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.638
Put pain from your mind.
And on the last day,

21:04.721 --> 21:08.100
when all will run at night, you alone
will be friendly with the dark.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.063
<i>You will need these medicines.</i>

21:13.480 --> 21:17.818
If you are ill,
this will give you strength.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.904
If you are hurt,

21:20.988 --> 21:25.033
this will heal you.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.853
Ten thousand dollars, Will.

22:36.354 --> 22:39.066
You don't have to die for it.
If we lose the farm--

22:39.149 --> 22:40.400
We'll lose it fighting.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.862
But we're not gonna lose it.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.823
Just come back alive.

23:02.005 --> 23:03.215
Will!

23:06.551 --> 23:07.719
Here.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.807
It's supposed to be from me.

23:18.313 --> 23:19.815
I think you're both crazy.

23:25.987 --> 23:28.990
Will, I'm your best friend.

23:29.074 --> 23:34.121
Don't matter what crazy things you do.
I just wish you could win.

23:34.412 --> 23:37.749
I'll win. You can bet
all your money on that.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.260
What's this?

23:57.477 --> 24:00.730
-What?
-It's just...

24:02.899 --> 24:06.111
Being alone out there.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.991
-Do you think I can do this?
-Matters most what you think.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.493
I think you should come, is what I think.

24:18.290 --> 24:21.001
Be strong, boy. Be brave.

24:21.501 --> 24:24.212
Your father will be with you always.
He lives in your dreams.

24:25.463 --> 24:29.342
Trust the dogs. Trust yourself.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.261
I will.

24:31.469 --> 24:34.556
When you come to face
the thing you fear...

24:34.639 --> 24:36.057
Let the Creator guide you.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.398
Ned...

24:44.774 --> 24:46.318
take care of my mom.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.113
Run longer.

24:51.114 --> 24:52.365
Sleep less.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.440
Wake up, son. You're in Winnipeg.

26:49.482 --> 26:52.193
Come on out of there. I'll show you
where you can put up your dogs.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.695
Thanks, mister.

26:57.907 --> 27:02.037
Somethin', ain't it?
Belongs to Mr. JW Harper...

27:02.120 --> 27:03.997
Sponsor of the dog derby.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.207
His personal steam locomotive.

27:21.765 --> 27:24.392
Well, that's what I hear. Now...

28:10.980 --> 28:15.110
Ladies and gentlemen,
from the great Clyde shipyards,

28:15.193 --> 28:16.820
Angus McTeague.

28:21.574 --> 28:25.161
Since the bankers control all the money,
I think it only right and proper

28:25.245 --> 28:27.872
that Louis De Fontaine
introduce his teams first.

28:30.125 --> 28:34.421
My team consists of two racers
from our mother Canada,

28:34.504 --> 28:36.881
from Quebec City, Jacques Devereaux,

28:36.965 --> 28:39.426
and from Montreal, Jean-Paul Remy.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.472
Angus, your teams, if you please.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.559
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to present

28:47.642 --> 28:52.147
Hyurtur Groven and Thordur Thorenson
from far-off Iceland.

28:56.484 --> 29:00.488
And the great Norwegian champion
Gunnar Tveit.

29:03.616 --> 29:06.453
And racing independently,

29:06.536 --> 29:09.914
Joe McPherson from Butte, Montana.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.292
The only American in the race.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.502
And from Sweden,

29:14.586 --> 29:17.380
the old Scandinavian champion,

29:17.464 --> 29:19.340
Borg Guillarson.

29:23.261 --> 29:26.139
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

29:26.222 --> 29:28.641
the president
of the Great Northern Railroad

29:28.725 --> 29:32.729
and sponsor of this derby, JW Harper!

29:35.023 --> 29:38.276
Thank you, Louis.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

29:38.359 --> 29:40.779
Racing for the Great Northern Railroad,

29:40.862 --> 29:43.907
I'm proud to introduce
Mike Riley from Calgary.

29:44.115 --> 29:47.786
-Take a bow, Mike.
-Take it to 'em, Mike!

29:47.994 --> 29:52.290
And the Canadian champion
Indian sledders, Gabriel and Albert.

29:52.540 --> 29:54.334
The legendary Carey brothers.

29:58.296 --> 30:00.298
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:02.717 --> 30:05.637
we are here about a race!

30:07.263 --> 30:08.765
Yeah!

30:13.478 --> 30:15.271
The race will commence tomorrow noon

30:15.355 --> 30:18.107
from the great clock tower
in the heart of Winnipeg.

30:18.191 --> 30:21.694
It will cover 522 miles.

30:21.778 --> 30:25.114
Starting order for all teams
will be luck of the draw.

30:25.365 --> 30:28.827
It will cover the following route.

30:28.910 --> 30:33.081
The first man to arrive at
Como Park Depot in St. Paul

30:33.164 --> 30:34.165
will be the winner.

30:34.332 --> 30:38.545
-Any questions about the--
-Mr. Harper! Sir! Mr. Harper! Sir!

30:38.628 --> 30:41.172
I'm Will Stoneman from South Dakota.

30:41.256 --> 30:44.259
-I'm here to enter the race.
-All right, lad. Let's go. Come on.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.386
Let him alone. Let him talk.

30:47.345 --> 30:51.349
You say you're registered to race?

30:51.975 --> 30:55.436
You're Will Stoneman? You're a boy!

30:55.520 --> 30:58.231
Well, I sent in my entrance form
and my $50.

30:58.314 --> 31:01.776
-So, I wanna run the race.
-You do, do you?

31:01.860 --> 31:04.863
Might I ask, what for?

31:05.363 --> 31:08.533
What for? For $10,000, that's what for.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.328
Hey, that sounds good to me!

31:14.706 --> 31:18.835
-How much money you got, son?
-Two dollars. Why?

31:19.002 --> 31:23.590
Well, I'm afraid the penalty
for late registration is $10.

31:25.633 --> 31:27.927
Well, I'll give you the $2 I got now...

31:28.011 --> 31:29.971
And the rest I'll pay from my winnings.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.974
I know what you're doing,
Mr. Harper, and I don't like it.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.143
-It's just 'cause I'm a kid!
-Wait!

31:36.603 --> 31:39.981
The Kane Newspaper Syndicate will
cover the boy's registration fee.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.233
Now, Mr. Kingsley--

31:42.317 --> 31:47.322
Sir, if this young man
is not allowed to compete,

31:47.405 --> 31:50.408
twenty million Americans
who daily read Kane papers

31:50.491 --> 31:52.827
-will loudly cry, "Foul!"
-Hear, hear!

31:52.994 --> 31:56.205
You're prepared to risk this young man's
life to sell some newspapers?

31:56.289 --> 31:58.708
If it gets me back
the warm office in Chicago, I am.

31:58.791 --> 32:01.127
-Son, how old are you?
-Almost eighteen.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.967
This young man may be fighting
Germans in a trench soon, Harper.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.595
A lot farther from home
than he is right now.

32:10.678 --> 32:14.349
And you're saying he's not
man enough to run a dog race!

32:14.432 --> 32:17.310
-Let the kid race.
-Yeah, let him race. He won't last

32:17.393 --> 32:18.394
through the first day.

32:18.478 --> 32:21.481
I'll last as long as any man here,
including you, mister.

32:22.148 --> 32:24.525
So, what's it gonna be, Mr. Harper?

32:24.609 --> 32:26.444
One more racer...

32:26.861 --> 32:30.531
-Or 20 million angry readers?
-Let him race!

32:33.451 --> 32:35.828
-Let him race!
-Let him race!

32:43.378 --> 32:47.298
Take a seat, lad.
Someone get him a packet.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.550
-And get the kid a cigar too.
-Music!

32:49.759 --> 32:53.846
<i>My name is Kaiser Bill</i>
<i>I'm the fella you want to kill</i>

32:53.930 --> 32:57.433
<i>And I must take off to Europe today</i>

32:57.517 --> 32:59.519
Son, look, have a cigar.

32:59.602 --> 33:02.605
<i>But I hear a voice of freedom calling</i>

33:02.689 --> 33:04.774
<i>Far across the sea</i>

33:04.857 --> 33:05.733
Hi.

33:05.817 --> 33:11.030
<i>And this is what they say to our men</i>

33:11.114 --> 33:13.199
<i>Go home, Kaiser Bill</i>

33:13.282 --> 33:14.117
Hey.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.910
<i>Pack up your guns and beer</i>

33:15.994 --> 33:19.998
<i>Pack up your guns and beer</i>
<i>Get yourself on out of here</i>

33:20.081 --> 33:24.836
<i>Go home, Kaiser Bill</i>
<i>Better not test our will</i>

33:24.919 --> 33:29.132
<i>We've almost had our fill</i>

33:29.215 --> 33:31.467
<i>Go home, Kaiser Bill</i>

33:31.551 --> 33:34.053
<i>Go home, Kaiser Bill</i>
<i>Pack up your guns and beer</i>

33:34.137 --> 33:37.849
<i>You're all my heart can bring</i>

33:38.016 --> 33:41.102
Not another word to these parasites, kid.
You're Kane property now.

33:41.185 --> 33:42.103
I'm nobody's property.

33:42.186 --> 33:43.938
No, of course not, kid. It's just
a figure of speech, that's all.

33:44.022 --> 33:47.525
Just make sure you talk to me before
them. Harry Kingsley, at your service.

33:47.608 --> 33:49.235
Sorry, I gave 'em away to all the ladies.

33:49.318 --> 33:52.238
You sure you want to sell
your soul to this devil, kid?

33:52.321 --> 33:54.240
Look. All I know is he put up my fee.

33:54.323 --> 33:55.450
I'm not here to sell anything.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.285
Of course you're not. Boy's got integrity.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.162
Yeah, but you'll cure him
of that in no time, right, Harry?

33:59.245 --> 34:00.455
That's cute.

34:03.958 --> 34:06.044
Drink it. Can't trust a man
that doesn't drink.

34:07.086 --> 34:09.755
To the best $8 investment I ever made.

34:14.635 --> 34:17.346
-Can't die on me now, kid.
-I never drank before.

34:17.429 --> 34:19.264
Yeah, you never raced before either.

34:20.766 --> 34:22.518
Can I ask you something?

34:22.976 --> 34:24.353
Why'd you help me?

34:24.853 --> 34:26.397
Helping you is helping myself.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.775
Having you in the race gives me
something to write about.

34:28.858 --> 34:30.860
Gotta sell newspapers, kid.

34:33.279 --> 34:36.449
I see it's the first time
for a lot of things, huh?

34:36.532 --> 34:38.534
Well, get an eyeful, kid,
'cause you won't be seeing anything

34:38.618 --> 34:40.703
but the butts on your dogs for some time.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.830
My dogs!

35:13.444 --> 35:16.948
-Back off!
-Hey, don't kick my dog, mister!

35:17.031 --> 35:19.075
Well, then you shut your dog up, boy!

35:19.158 --> 35:21.494
Well, it was your dog
that started the trouble.

35:21.702 --> 35:24.831
-You okay, Gus? You okay?
-So...

35:24.914 --> 35:27.917
you think you gonna last
as long as me, huh?

35:34.507 --> 35:36.551
You ever had frostbite?

35:36.884 --> 35:38.970
You will, you run this race.

35:41.139 --> 35:45.143
Yeah, the mercury drop to 30 below.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.186
Forty below sometime.

35:47.687 --> 35:52.150
Your fingers and toes,
they gonna look like this.

35:53.776 --> 35:55.194
Yeah.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.489
This race, boy...

35:58.573 --> 36:01.993
This is the meanest stretch
of land that God ever put together.

36:03.035 --> 36:05.538
Good men have died out there.

36:07.456 --> 36:10.418
When you get the frostbite, you call me.

36:10.501 --> 36:12.628
I cut off anything you want.

36:13.045 --> 36:17.175
-No charge.
-Don't give me an excuse, Borg.

36:17.258 --> 36:20.219
You got a little frostbite
on the brain, don't you?

36:21.345 --> 36:22.889
What you say to me?

36:23.890 --> 36:26.225
I said, don't let me catch you
irritating my countryman again.

36:26.309 --> 36:29.604
-Now, git!
-Come on, Joe.

36:29.896 --> 36:32.899
I was just having fun with the boy.

36:32.982 --> 36:35.860
Remember to call me
if you need anything cut off.

36:44.076 --> 36:46.120
Stay away from him. Mean.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.790
Got a little timber wolf not far down
the family tree. You all right?

36:49.874 --> 36:52.293
Yeah. Yeah, we're okay.

36:52.376 --> 36:55.004
-All right. Take care.
-Thanks.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.559
I require a gentleman's promise
from each of you.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.562
You will not try to steal my chef.
He is world class.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.689
Although, at the end of the journey...

37:13.773 --> 37:17.526
Since I've laid in some excellent
vintages... Thank you, Abdul.

37:17.610 --> 37:20.279
I'll make a gift of them to you
if we have anything left over.

37:20.947 --> 37:25.117
But, in the meantime, I think you'll find
this cognac more than satisfactory.

37:25.201 --> 37:28.496
Elevated only by the taste
of my imported Havana cigars.

37:28.579 --> 37:32.333
You should not have let him enter,
JW, reporter or not.

37:32.416 --> 37:35.336
I was not about to let Kingsley
ruin the reputation of the race!

37:35.419 --> 37:39.257
Whatever he might have done, it'll be
nothing compared to what you'll face

37:39.340 --> 37:41.384
if that boy gets himself killed.

37:41.467 --> 37:45.721
Louis, we'll let the boy race for a day,
then find some reason to disqualify him.

37:45.805 --> 37:48.474
Gentlemen, didn't you want to
take on the world at that age?

37:48.557 --> 37:51.394
-Let the boy have a day!
-If he lasts that long.

37:51.477 --> 37:52.770
I'll bet $500 he does.

37:52.853 --> 37:56.065
You two have already bet
over $5,000, Jonah.

37:56.148 --> 37:58.401
Well, then you're not gonna miss
another $500, are you, Angus?

37:58.484 --> 37:59.485
Right!

37:59.777 --> 38:02.989
It's $1,000,
says he won't make Heartbreak Hill.

38:03.072 --> 38:05.616
-No.
-Yes. You're on.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.874
I couldn't have dreamed all this.

38:16.085 --> 38:17.712
Can't wait to tell Ward.

38:21.048 --> 38:22.425
Tell you something, though, Gus.

38:23.384 --> 38:27.388
Ned's right. Gotta stay away
from those racers.

38:31.183 --> 38:33.185
Hey, how 'bout acting like
I'm the boss tomorrow, huh?

38:33.519 --> 38:35.563
Not embarrass me in front of 1,000 people?

39:35.915 --> 39:37.708
I noticed your article, Harry.

39:38.292 --> 39:41.545
-All the way on page 14.
-Yeah, that's cute.

39:43.172 --> 39:46.967
And so we send you brave men
off in competition

39:47.051 --> 39:51.013
with the pride of many nations
at your shoulders.

39:51.097 --> 39:54.600
Good luck and Godspeed.

39:55.142 --> 39:57.770
Racing teams, are you ready?

40:06.070 --> 40:09.740
Come on, dog team. Come on!

40:31.470 --> 40:33.472
Hut, hut, hut!

40:42.398 --> 40:45.317
Come on, boy! Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

40:51.490 --> 40:55.744
Good boy. Come on, Gus. Let's go!
Come on, Gus! Let's go!

40:55.828 --> 40:57.538
Go, Will!

41:00.207 --> 41:02.209
Let's go! Come on, now.

41:43.459 --> 41:46.545
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on, Gus! Come on, boy!

41:47.171 --> 41:49.548
Come on! Come on! Let's move!

41:50.216 --> 41:51.592
Let's go, Gus! Come on!

41:51.675 --> 41:55.471
Keep up that pace, you'll be burying
them dogs in Canadian ground.

41:55.554 --> 41:56.555
Come on!

41:56.639 --> 41:58.224
Hey, kid, where you goin' in such a hurry?

41:58.307 --> 42:02.353
St. Paul, Minnesota.
Come on, let's go! We got 'em!

42:12.738 --> 42:14.323
We're coming up on the racers, sir!

42:14.406 --> 42:16.951
Well, slow the train down, then, man.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.078
-Jonah! Here.
-Thank you.

42:19.161 --> 42:20.704
Wonder how that young man's faring.

42:20.788 --> 42:23.249
He's probably dropped
out of the race already.

42:23.415 --> 42:26.418
If I was you, Jonah,
I'd get my $1,000 out now

42:26.502 --> 42:32.883
because there's my boys coming up
according to plan. One, two and three!

42:36.887 --> 42:40.140
Make that nine, ten and 11, Angus.
Look up there.

42:40.224 --> 42:44.812
-What?
-Where are Remy and Devereaux?

42:47.481 --> 42:50.192
Good Lord! That young man's in the lead!

42:51.694 --> 42:53.821
Hey, the kid's in the lead.

42:53.904 --> 42:55.823
You think your boy's got a chance, Harry?

42:55.906 --> 42:57.324
Doesn't matter what I think, Lambert.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.368
If I convince 20 million Americans he can,

42:59.451 --> 43:01.412
I may be back in the good graces
of my editor.

43:01.495 --> 43:02.705
Well, Heartbreak Hill's comin' up.

43:02.788 --> 43:04.582
If he can make it through
that and Devil's Run,

43:04.665 --> 43:07.084
you might get that desk after all.

43:10.754 --> 43:14.174
Attaboy, Gus! We'll give 'em something
to talk about back home!

44:13.192 --> 44:15.235
Come on, boys. Come on!

44:39.968 --> 44:41.178
Wanna thank ya!

44:56.402 --> 45:01.573
Hey, you cut a good trail, boy!
Hut! He's a trailblazer.

45:02.157 --> 45:04.451
I cut the trail for them. I cut the trail!

45:04.535 --> 45:07.037
Move up, Adrian, move up!

45:07.121 --> 45:10.207
Hey, Will! Let's go!

45:12.084 --> 45:13.627
-On, Adrian.
-Okay.

45:13.794 --> 45:15.796
Let's go now, move.

45:17.214 --> 45:19.716
Okay.

45:21.176 --> 45:23.720
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go!

45:57.588 --> 45:59.506
Beautiful, no?

45:59.798 --> 46:01.842
This is as far as you go, kid.

46:04.011 --> 46:05.679
Leave him alone, Borg.

46:05.804 --> 46:08.932
How 'bout $25 to the man
who reaches bottom first?

46:09.391 --> 46:11.185
You're out of your mind, Guillarson.

46:11.643 --> 46:13.562
What, are you scared, Riley?

46:13.645 --> 46:18.567
Maybe you should slide down on your rump
along with the <i>boyka</i> here, huh?

46:18.650 --> 46:20.360
Better yet, make it good.

46:21.111 --> 46:23.030
One hundred dollars?

46:23.780 --> 46:25.616
One hundred dollars!

46:48.889 --> 46:51.350
Faster!

47:06.406 --> 47:07.533
Come on, Gus!

47:32.099 --> 47:33.559
Hey, Borg!

47:39.856 --> 47:41.650
Come on!

47:42.109 --> 47:44.945
Come on, Adrian! Comin' by.

47:46.363 --> 47:47.364
Let me through!

47:50.534 --> 47:52.035
Hey, what are you doin'?

47:52.119 --> 47:54.788
Borg! Borg!

48:01.837 --> 48:03.964
Adrian!

48:29.406 --> 48:33.243
-Joe!
-Go on! I'm all right!

48:35.245 --> 48:36.747
Joe!

48:44.212 --> 48:46.965
Gus! No, no, Gus!

48:47.132 --> 48:49.092
Hey, Gus!

48:49.718 --> 48:53.972
Hey, we wanna finish this race,
we gotta make some kind of peace. Hear?

48:55.891 --> 48:58.644
Gus! Gus!

49:14.368 --> 49:16.078
We're on the southern side?

49:16.161 --> 49:18.205
Yeah, right over there.

49:18.538 --> 49:22.334
Wire just came.
The Icelanders are in Morris.

49:22.417 --> 49:24.920
-McTeague's boys.
-That's 12 miles ahead.

49:25.003 --> 49:27.464
Ahead of the Carey brothers.
Boy, Harper's gonna be fuming

49:27.547 --> 49:29.174
when he hears that, huh, Kingsley?

49:29.966 --> 49:32.469
Don't look so concerned, Harry.
Your boy's out there somewhere.

49:33.136 --> 49:36.390
-No news is good news.
-No news is unemployment.

49:36.765 --> 49:38.558
Wait, wait. Groven's lost two dogs.

49:38.642 --> 49:42.729
Devereaux, the Frenchman, is out,
and one of the Americans.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.106
Not your American.

49:47.442 --> 49:50.362
Seems to me a man who really wanted
to win this race would keep on goin'

49:50.445 --> 49:54.282
instead of pullin' up every night
to have supper with his competitors.

49:54.366 --> 49:57.494
Smart fella, huh?
You go out there, why don't ya, huh?

49:57.661 --> 50:00.580
Go on out there.
Take a leak while you're at it.

50:00.664 --> 50:03.667
Watch it freeze before it hits the ground.

50:05.627 --> 50:07.129
He wants us to race at night.

50:08.630 --> 50:10.674
He wants us to race at night!

50:12.217 --> 50:14.511
Well, look who's here.

50:14.594 --> 50:16.805
That little lost Yankee.

50:16.888 --> 50:18.890
I think for sure I'd never see you again.

50:19.224 --> 50:20.767
We made it, didn't we?

50:23.311 --> 50:25.230
You be careful now.

50:25.522 --> 50:28.525
The cowboy ain't here
to protect you no more.

50:55.886 --> 50:57.596
Good boy.

51:04.394 --> 51:06.354
Leavin' awful early, aren't you, kid?

51:06.605 --> 51:08.982
Yeah, bad weather's comin'.

51:09.065 --> 51:10.650
I'd like to get out in front if I can.

51:17.699 --> 51:20.702
-What's that?
-Fruitcake.

51:22.537 --> 51:25.040
You're gonna run 40 miles on fruitcake?

51:25.123 --> 51:27.667
It's a special fruit cake, Mr. Kingsley.

51:28.043 --> 51:29.711
Well, I wouldn't go around
talkin' about it.

51:29.795 --> 51:31.546
People think you're crazy enough as it is.

51:31.630 --> 51:32.923
Well, they can think what they want.

51:33.006 --> 51:35.217
It saves time not havin'
to build fires or cook,

51:35.300 --> 51:37.969
and it cuts down on the weight
I gotta carry.

51:38.136 --> 51:39.387
Okay, let's go!

51:47.354 --> 51:48.563
Fruitcake?

51:49.898 --> 51:52.234
Geez, this kid's a gift from God.

51:57.656 --> 52:00.242
<i>"Date line, the Canadian wilderness.</i>

52:00.325 --> 52:03.829
<i>At a time when the hearts of</i>
<i>this nation cry out for heroes,</i>

52:03.912 --> 52:07.666
<i>remember that there's a boy</i>
<i>out there, an American boy,</i>

52:07.749 --> 52:11.294
<i>racing against man,</i>
<i>against nature, against time</i>

52:11.378 --> 52:14.130
<i>with his mother's fruitcake</i>
<i>and a homemade whistle</i>

52:14.214 --> 52:17.425
and a spirit that speaks
of the truest American ideals.

52:17.717 --> 52:20.345
<i>So when you read this name, remember it.</i>

52:20.428 --> 52:23.849
Remember the name 'Will Stoneman.'"

52:28.019 --> 52:30.647
Gus! Gus...

52:36.152 --> 52:39.489
Dad! Dad, no!

52:39.573 --> 52:41.783
Dad, no!

52:41.867 --> 52:44.744
Gus, get back up here. Get up here now!

52:46.371 --> 52:48.206
No, we're not crossing the lake, Gus.

52:48.999 --> 52:50.458
Come on!

53:15.275 --> 53:16.860
Page nine.

53:19.070 --> 53:20.572
I need something else.

53:21.281 --> 53:22.949
Can you hear me?

53:23.909 --> 53:27.120
Can you hear me? It's Kingsley.

53:27.203 --> 53:29.247
Listen. Get a hold of Potter.

53:29.331 --> 53:32.626
Send him right away
to Birch Ridge, South Dakota.

53:32.918 --> 53:34.753
South Dakota!

53:34.836 --> 53:38.590
Tell him to get everything he can
on Will Stoneman and his family.

53:40.425 --> 53:41.801
Well, find out where it is.

53:41.885 --> 53:44.262
I don't care if you have to drop him
down there from a balloon.

53:44.346 --> 53:46.056
Just get me that story!

54:06.326 --> 54:07.827
Come on, boys.

54:18.630 --> 54:20.632
I just need a rest.

54:54.874 --> 54:58.586
We'll be comin' up
on Pembina in 30 minutes.

54:58.670 --> 55:01.381
Thirty minutes, Pembina.

55:01.881 --> 55:03.758
Thirty minutes.

55:06.678 --> 55:08.596
What if something happens to him, Harry?

55:09.139 --> 55:10.515
What do you mean?

55:10.598 --> 55:12.809
Don't you feel somewhat responsible?
He's missing.

55:12.892 --> 55:15.395
What for? For tryin' to get him
on the front page?

55:15.478 --> 55:17.981
This kid'll have bigger headlines than
the war when I get through with him.

55:18.064 --> 55:21.192
-All of America will hear about him.
-You got it wrong, Harry.

55:21.276 --> 55:22.902
He'll make you. If it wasn't for him,

55:22.986 --> 55:26.114
you'd still be on the back page.
The canine section.

55:26.197 --> 55:29.367
I just hope he lasts long enough for me
to get that big promotion, that's all.

55:29.701 --> 55:34.956
-And if he dies?
-Then he'll die a hero, a somebody.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.625
And I'll write
one hell of an obituary for him,

55:37.709 --> 55:39.627
lauding his courage, his idealism.

55:39.711 --> 55:43.256
You know enough about such things
to write about them, Harry?

55:44.132 --> 55:47.802
I know plenty, Lambert. Plenty.

55:59.981 --> 56:01.274
There's one coming in!

56:01.900 --> 56:03.318
There he is! We found him.

56:03.401 --> 56:06.029
-We need some help over here.
-Come on! Make way!

56:06.112 --> 56:08.406
It's Remy! Remy!

56:08.490 --> 56:10.116
He's frozen to the sled.

56:10.200 --> 56:11.743
Cut him loose! Cut him loose!

56:13.161 --> 56:14.579
Hurry up.

56:14.871 --> 56:17.207
Get him inside, quickly! Hurry.

56:17.290 --> 56:18.583
Come on.

56:28.259 --> 56:29.886
You're crazy, Groven!

56:30.345 --> 56:32.764
You'll never make the next checkpoint!

56:32.847 --> 56:35.391
You'll die out there!

57:18.935 --> 57:20.645
Gus?

57:21.771 --> 57:24.399
I fell asleep, didn't I?

57:27.735 --> 57:29.654
I would've died if it wasn't for you.

57:36.411 --> 57:38.913
Holy Chicago!

57:40.415 --> 57:42.792
-Hey.
-Come on, wake up!

57:42.876 --> 57:44.335
What's goin' on?

57:45.003 --> 57:46.004
He's in!

57:46.421 --> 57:49.466
Get the door! Get the door!
Get the flash! Get the flash!

57:49.549 --> 57:50.550
Let's go.

57:58.433 --> 58:00.602
Step aside. Let a man through.

58:00.685 --> 58:02.479
Let a man through. Hiya, kid!

58:03.605 --> 58:05.773
-What? What was that?
-That was me, kid,

58:05.857 --> 58:06.774
lighting the way for you.

58:06.858 --> 58:07.984
-Here. Get this out yesterday!
-Got it!

58:08.067 --> 58:10.361
-How ya doin', kid?
-A little tired.

58:10.695 --> 58:12.572
Okay, come on, come on. Let him through.

58:12.655 --> 58:13.698
Take care of my dogs, please.

58:13.781 --> 58:15.074
The boy's been through enough.

58:15.158 --> 58:16.743
Will, do you plan to continue
with the race?

58:16.826 --> 58:17.702
Not tonight.

58:20.872 --> 58:24.667
My brother says you run too hard.
You must rest.

58:40.850 --> 58:43.228
You owe me $100, Riley.

58:43.686 --> 58:45.563
I'll pay ya out of my winnings.

58:46.272 --> 58:49.776
You will pay when it's time.

58:54.697 --> 58:56.366
Yeah.

59:05.041 --> 59:06.834
It's cold out there, huh?

59:09.254 --> 59:12.590
Your mama, she must worry for you, boy?

59:14.842 --> 59:18.012
You miss your mama...

59:18.096 --> 59:20.265
And your papa?

59:20.515 --> 59:22.392
Leave me alone.

59:24.811 --> 59:26.563
Go home, boy.

59:29.440 --> 59:33.027
Before when it's too late, you go home.

01:00:47.685 --> 01:00:49.354
Why don't you have some coffee?

01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:01.908
Buried again.

01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:21.052
Easy.

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:27.308
Looks like one of the Icelanders, boys.
We're closin' the gap.

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:28.601
Okay, let's go.

01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:49.706
Groven?

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.167
Groven!

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:02.468
Gunther. He not old.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:07.223
-Good dog.
-No, I...

01:02:07.598 --> 01:02:11.185
-My good dogs.
-You're burning up.

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:18.860
Go.

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:24.866
Go!

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.844
Okay, hup, hup!

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.333
Come on, boy!

01:03:17.376 --> 01:03:20.379
Borg! Come on, boys!

01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:26.010
Hey! Come on! What are you doing?

01:03:26.844 --> 01:03:28.137
Hey!

01:03:31.557 --> 01:03:34.852
See you in St. Paul, Riley!

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:41.275
See you in St. Paul someday.

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:55.456
-Excuse me. Watch it.
-Influenza. It's bad.

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:59.544
-You're lucky somebody found ya!
-Boy.

01:04:00.461 --> 01:04:03.256
Boy? What boy?

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:08.135
-The American?
-Stoneman?

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:10.555
Stoneman.

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:17.895
-Stoneman?
-Stoneman.

01:04:28.155 --> 01:04:31.659
Well, Angus, this boy cost you $1,000,

01:04:31.742 --> 01:04:34.036
but he did save your man's life.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.748
And if he's kept going,
then he's ahead of them all.

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:39.667
Boy has the heart of a bear.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.628
He lost a lot of strength
saving your man like that.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.505
He could've died out there himself,
you know.

01:04:44.922 --> 01:04:47.800
I'll wager $5,000
he doesn't reach St. Paul.

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:50.761
I'll take that bet.

01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:26.464
Okay, let's go.

01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:28.007
Let's go!

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.183
Come on.

01:05:47.234 --> 01:05:49.946
Heroic! Unbelievable!
Over the last four days and nights,

01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:52.573
in a dog sled race running
between Winnipeg and St. Paul--

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:55.576
Selfless, courageous sacrifice.
Racked by incapacitating influenza--

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:58.496
Will Stoneman, the plucky 17-year-old
hailing from South Dakota--

01:05:58.579 --> 01:06:00.039
He saved someone's life.

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:02.708
He's the last American hope in this race.

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:06.337
Racing through the night, driven by
his own iron will with a courageous--

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:09.173
Wait a minute. Hold it.

01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:12.468
Iron Will. That's great!

01:06:12.551 --> 01:06:13.970
Kingsley, you're a genius.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:15.596
Iron Will Stoneman, American hero--

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.806
-Iron Will Stoneman--

01:06:16.889 --> 01:06:18.891
-Iron Will Stoneman--
-Iron Will Stoneman--

01:06:23.187 --> 01:06:26.816
<i>Homegrown hero left Birch Ridge a boy,</i>
<i>but he'll return a man.</i>

01:06:26.899 --> 01:06:27.900
<i>He's in the lead.</i>

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:29.527
<i>He saved someone's life.</i>

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:33.030
<i>He's the last American hope in this race.</i>

01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:37.994
<i>The nation holds its breath in awe as</i>
<i>its newest champion, Iron Will Stoneman</i>

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:39.954
<i>forges on with little rest,</i>

01:06:40.037 --> 01:06:43.541
<i>barely holding his fragile lead</i>
<i>as the dog derby continues.</i>

01:06:43.624 --> 01:06:45.710
<i>So, as war looms over Europe,</i>

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:48.921
<i>the nation roots for a new symbol</i>
<i>of hope and determination.</i>

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:52.800
<i>This heroic tale of a young man's</i>
<i>bravery spreads across the land,</i>

01:06:52.883 --> 01:06:56.721
<i>and America rallies</i>
<i>behind Iron Will Stoneman.</i>

01:06:58.055 --> 01:07:00.266
Up, up, up, A little right, little right.
That's great, Harry, that's great.

01:07:01.767 --> 01:07:06.439
Okay, here we go, everybody.
One, two, three, cheese!

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:30.421
Watch your step.

01:07:32.673 --> 01:07:34.508
There you are.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:52.443
-Can I help you, sir?
-Excuse me.

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:55.613
Could you tell me where I might find
the kin of Will Stoneman?

01:07:57.823 --> 01:07:59.992
-Where's the box?
-Box of what?

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:02.036
The boy's remains.

01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:03.454
The boy's...

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:07.458
Mister, don't you people
get the papers out here?

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:10.753
"Nourished only by his mother's fruitcake,

01:08:10.836 --> 01:08:13.422
he carries a hand-carved whistle

01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:17.843
from which emanates a melody
people have taken to calling

01:08:18.844 --> 01:08:20.011
Will's tune."

01:08:20.304 --> 01:08:22.890
What is the significance
of this whistling?

01:08:22.973 --> 01:08:27.144
-It must be some magic tune, huh?
-It's his father's tune.

01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:31.439
I see. Well, charming.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:35.361
And how does Mr. Stoneman feel
about young Will racing?

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:39.823
His father's very proud of him.

01:08:51.042 --> 01:08:52.752
Tell Kingsley I've got an angle for him.

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:57.466
Iron Will races to save
mother's farm and go to college.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:09:01.511
I'm not making it up. His father's dead.

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:04.305
I'm putting the mother and the Indian
on a train to St. Paul.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:07.268
They'll be there for the finish.
Don't tell the kid.

01:09:09.603 --> 01:09:11.229
Anyone know where the kid is?

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:13.983
The kid's been runnin' for a week,
and we still can't track him.

01:09:14.191 --> 01:09:16.277
Well, I know he's running!
But how far did he get?

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:19.196
-Where did he stop?
-He didn't stop.

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:21.657
He's still out there somewhere.

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:27.412
Angus.

01:09:28.538 --> 01:09:32.334
That $10,000 we bet, maybe...

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:34.461
Maybe we should send
some of it to the boy's mother.

01:09:34.795 --> 01:09:36.755
You do what you like
with your money, Jonah,

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.756
but don't tell me what to do with mine.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:44.180
Jonah! Jonah, I still can't understand

01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:47.433
why you allowed that boy
to stay in the race.

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:49.560
I'll tell you why.

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:54.565
Because when I looked in that boy's eyes,

01:09:54.648 --> 01:09:57.902
I saw myself 35 years ago.

01:09:59.111 --> 01:10:02.656
Have we come so far that
we've forgotten what it's like

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:07.620
to start out with nothing but
a dim chance and a bright hope?

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:13.709
I will not be the one to snuff out
that hope, gentlemen.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:16.545
Not I.

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:10.808
-There's no sign of Stoneman.
-Doesn't matter.

01:11:11.141 --> 01:11:12.309
He's crazy out of his mind.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:13.852
You never sleep, you go crazy.

01:11:14.186 --> 01:11:16.438
So crazy he's beatin' the lot of you.

01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:22.486
He'll never make the finish line.
Nobody can last at his pace.

01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:25.406
That's what you said on the first day,

01:11:25.489 --> 01:11:27.366
and he's still runnin'.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:32.830
Can you catch 'im?

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:37.710
You know I've personally wagered
$10,000 my men would beat him.

01:11:38.585 --> 01:11:39.795
Ten thousand?

01:11:40.546 --> 01:11:41.755
Catch him.

01:11:42.339 --> 01:11:43.757
Stop him.

01:11:43.882 --> 01:11:48.554
And you might find yourself
the beneficiary of a handsome sum.

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:50.973
Half.

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:31.073
No, no!

01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:37.746
Gus! No!

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:40.833
No, no! Gus! Gus!

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:42.000
Gus!

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:32.509
Boil water.

01:14:33.594 --> 01:14:37.639
Mix herbs. Cook down.

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:42.436
Make a paste.

01:14:47.107 --> 01:14:50.110
Don't die on me now, boy.

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:53.572
We were just startin' to get along.

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:03.582
Now's when we need each other most.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.507
It's okay, Gus.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:54.049
-You tried to kill my dog!
-Come on! Come on!

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:09.439
You want to fight, huh, kid?
You want to fight?

01:16:09.982 --> 01:16:11.191
So you want to fight?

01:16:14.861 --> 01:16:17.489
What's the matter, kid, you scared?

01:16:20.325 --> 01:16:22.661
I'm beyond being scared of you, mister.

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:27.040
Will, no matter what he's done,
you tell us about it.

01:16:27.124 --> 01:16:28.667
We'll take care of it.

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:29.751
I oughta kill you.

01:16:30.836 --> 01:16:35.048
If you ever come near me
or my team again, I'll kill you outright.

01:16:35.716 --> 01:16:37.968
So help me, God, I will.

01:16:50.814 --> 01:16:52.566
Will, it's good to see you.
I was gettin' worried--

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:57.821
That's for using me and my family
to sell your damn newspapers

01:16:57.904 --> 01:17:00.574
and printing pictures that are
gonna make my mother worry.

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:03.493
You okay? You all right, Harry?

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:08.665
Never figured him to threaten
a man with a gun.

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:12.669
What's tomorrow's headline, Mr. Kingsley?

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:24.514
I should have never made you do this, Gus.

01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:27.768
I'm sorry.

01:17:30.354 --> 01:17:32.189
I'm so sorry.

01:17:37.152 --> 01:17:38.987
How are you, Will?

01:17:39.237 --> 01:17:42.032
Iit's a fine, fine race you're runnin'.

01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:46.244
Angus McTeague,
official sponsor of the race.

01:17:46.578 --> 01:17:50.123
I know who you are, sir.
Where are the others?

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:52.918
The others? No, I came alone.

01:17:53.543 --> 01:17:57.255
I wanted to thank ya
for savin' the life of my driver.

01:17:57.547 --> 01:17:59.466
It was very noble of ya.

01:17:59.549 --> 01:18:03.303
You came all the way here
to thank me, Mr. McTeague?

01:18:03.387 --> 01:18:05.305
I may be young, but I'm not dumb.

01:18:07.974 --> 01:18:10.602
I was compelled to come

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:14.940
when I saw the terrible condition
of you and your team.

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:20.070
You've put up a brave fight, lad.

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:23.782
And there's not a man amongst us
that doesn't admire your effort.

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:27.327
But I do feel very strongly

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:31.123
that for you to continue
would be risking your life.

01:18:31.915 --> 01:18:35.293
I'm not quitting
if that's what you're driving at.

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.587
Withdrawing

01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:42.676
with $3,000 in your pocket
isn't exactly quitting.

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:45.512
What $3,000?

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:48.598
I am prepared to offer you a reward

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:52.394
of $3,000.

01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:57.691
That's a lot of money, Mr. McTeague.

01:18:59.025 --> 01:19:01.236
It is, son. It is.

01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:09.119
Well, you sleep on it.

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.372
And ask yourself

01:19:12.456 --> 01:19:16.501
If you haven't already achieved the goals
you had starting out.

01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:19.629
How do I know you'll pay?

01:19:20.464 --> 01:19:22.632
I'm not saying I'm gonna do it.

01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:27.095
Well, when you say you are gonna do it,

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:30.390
I'll personally hand ya $3,000.

01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:36.354
Now, you take care
of that wee doggy there.

01:19:37.063 --> 01:19:39.107
He'd be a real beaut to lose.

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:52.871
What? What, I didn't take it, did I?

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:56.500
Will!

01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:01.922
Come on. This is crazy.
You need more sleep than this.

01:20:02.005 --> 01:20:05.175
You oughta be happy, Mr. Kingsley.
It'll give you another headline.

01:20:05.258 --> 01:20:07.260
You'd probably love
to see me die, wouldn't you?

01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:08.345
You've got my obituary

01:20:08.428 --> 01:20:09.721
-written up already, I bet, huh?
-Will.

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:14.518
I wouldn't spend another minute with you
no-good bunch of backstabbing liars!

01:20:15.852 --> 01:20:17.896
Get outta my way! Let's go.

01:20:37.415 --> 01:20:40.168
Easy, easy.

01:20:46.883 --> 01:20:49.594
Gus, you hear something?
You hear something, Gus?

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:51.012
What is that?

01:20:52.013 --> 01:20:54.224
Okay, let's go, Curly. Come on!

01:21:05.777 --> 01:21:06.945
Hi.

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:10.240
Attaboy, son!
The whole town's waitin' on ya!

01:21:10.323 --> 01:21:12.284
-There he is!
-It's Will!

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:23.253
Will!

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.761
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:34.639
Iron Will! Iron Will, my father
said to give these to you.

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:36.349
Said there's a few
hundred miles left in 'em.

01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:39.978
Thanks. My name's Will Stoneman.
I think you might be confusing me--

01:21:40.061 --> 01:21:42.689
To us, you're Iron Will, American hero.

01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:44.316
That's what all the papers call you.

01:21:44.399 --> 01:21:48.028
You're on the front page every day.
Every paper from here to New York City.

01:21:48.111 --> 01:21:50.614
Wait till you see.
The whole country's rootin' for you!

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:54.034
Look at this, "Iron Will saves
the Icelander and takes the lead."

01:21:54.117 --> 01:21:56.578
"Iron Will races to save mother's farm."

01:21:56.661 --> 01:21:59.789
"Iron Will vows to realize
father's dream."

01:22:00.373 --> 01:22:02.876
-We love ya!
-"Iron Will...

01:22:02.959 --> 01:22:04.878
America's hope."

01:22:05.128 --> 01:22:08.506
-America's hope!
-Yeah, for Iron Will!

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:12.844
Thank you. Thank you.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:15.639
Thank you all for everything.

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:17.974
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:20.727
God be with you!

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.953
Well, Gus, they're sayin' we're heroes.

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:39.996
We better start racing like heroes, huh?

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:45.001
-Iron Will, can we run with ya?
-We know a shortcut.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:57.681
-Come on, she's frozen, okay?
-Is there a...

01:22:57.764 --> 01:22:59.766
-Is there a bridge around?
-Well, sure.

01:22:59.849 --> 01:23:02.394
The train bridge. But it'll take us
two miles out of the way.

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:04.062
That's where we'll cross.

01:23:04.145 --> 01:23:06.189
But that's an awful waste of time, Will.

01:23:06.272 --> 01:23:08.108
That's where we'll cross, all right?

01:23:37.387 --> 01:23:40.473
Will! Train's coming!

01:23:40.807 --> 01:23:42.434
Unhook the dogs!

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:45.520
No, forget it! There's not enough time.
Let's go! Let's go!

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:54.487
Hurry!

01:24:03.997 --> 01:24:06.875
No! No, no, no, Gus.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:19.012
It's okay, it's okay!

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:21.222
Okay, let's move it!

01:24:24.476 --> 01:24:26.352
Run, Will, run!

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:56.800
-Will!
-You look like death, boy.

01:24:56.883 --> 01:24:59.094
Well, grab a chair, kid.
I'll get you a drink.

01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:00.386
No.

01:25:02.555 --> 01:25:04.182
I need a blacksmith.

01:25:06.226 --> 01:25:08.561
My sled's busted.

01:25:47.934 --> 01:25:50.019
Now, tell me if this is too hot.

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:52.981
-Thank you.
-That's fine?

01:25:53.064 --> 01:25:54.399
-Yeah.
-All right.

01:25:59.028 --> 01:26:00.613
See how rested they were?

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:05.160
I should have listened to those boys
and crossed the river.

01:26:05.243 --> 01:26:06.661
Oh, my God.

01:26:08.454 --> 01:26:12.417
Good evening. If it's not too much bother,

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:16.588
I'd like to talk to the lad alone.

01:26:28.308 --> 01:26:31.853
I'm prepared to raise the sum
considerably, Will.

01:26:32.145 --> 01:26:36.524
-Let's say $5,000.
-Keep your money, McTeague.

01:26:37.317 --> 01:26:40.695
I'm finishing this race
no matter how sick I am.

01:26:41.988 --> 01:26:43.281
Son...

01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:47.076
I don't think you realize who I am.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.870
But I do, McTeague.

01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:51.873
In fact, I'd recognize you
from a pretty good distance.

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:55.251
Kingsley! How long
have you been hidin' there?

01:26:55.335 --> 01:26:57.003
Long enough, McTeague.

01:26:57.086 --> 01:27:00.924
Now, I suggest you get out of here
before I make you tomorrow's headline.

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:03.426
Look, we should talk about this.

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:05.720
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

01:27:05.803 --> 01:27:09.682
If you bother the boy again,
trust me, the world will know it.

01:27:17.273 --> 01:27:18.483
That felt good.

01:27:26.157 --> 01:27:29.077
Can you wake me in three hours?

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:38.211
Listen, kid, this is crazy.
You're gonna kill yourself.

01:27:38.294 --> 01:27:40.588
You've gotta sleep longer than that.

01:27:41.381 --> 01:27:44.968
Make it two hours. Okay?

01:27:49.472 --> 01:27:50.765
Two hours.

01:27:53.476 --> 01:27:55.436
You got it, kid.

01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:06.281
Mr. Kingsley? Thanks.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.367
You're not so bad after all.

01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:13.955
Don't get soft on me now, kid.

01:28:34.684 --> 01:28:36.894
Relax. The boy sleeps.

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.439
On the last day,

01:28:39.522 --> 01:28:42.900
when one leads, the rest must follow.

01:28:51.451 --> 01:28:55.997
Which fool will start the day?

01:29:01.294 --> 01:29:02.545
Will.

01:29:07.675 --> 01:29:09.052
Come on.

01:29:10.428 --> 01:29:11.804
It's time.

01:29:17.935 --> 01:29:19.145
What is it?

01:29:19.228 --> 01:29:22.023
I can't get up. I can't move
my arms and my legs.

01:29:22.106 --> 01:29:23.316
That's it. I'm getting a doctor.

01:29:23.399 --> 01:29:25.401
No, no, no.
I just gotta get my blood going.

01:29:25.485 --> 01:29:26.652
Just help me.

01:29:32.325 --> 01:29:35.661
-No!
-Will, you can't go on now.

01:29:35.745 --> 01:29:37.413
Enough is enough. I'm gonna get a doctor.

01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:39.874
No. I am one day short of the finish line

01:29:39.957 --> 01:29:42.293
and not you or anyone else
is gonna stop me.

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:44.420
So help me, or leave me alone.

01:29:46.839 --> 01:29:49.634
It's not about me anymore, Mr. Kingsley.

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:53.638
It's about all those people,
all the people pulling for me.

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:57.850
It's about those boys. They came out
and cut trails. It's about--

01:29:57.934 --> 01:29:59.936
It's about you, Will, huh?

01:30:00.853 --> 01:30:03.856
-What about you?
-Just help me.

01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:16.369
Hey, Gus. Hey.

01:30:18.621 --> 01:30:23.626
Now, you gotta stay here
if I'm gonna have a chance at this thing.

01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:27.755
Hey, you want to wake somebody,
mess everything up?

01:30:39.642 --> 01:30:41.644
Okay.

01:30:44.188 --> 01:30:47.525
We started this together,
we'll finish it together.

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:51.654
That's the way it oughta be.
You stay down.

01:30:52.697 --> 01:30:55.825
Okay, we're gonna get goin'.

01:30:56.075 --> 01:30:57.785
Stay there, Gus.

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:02.790
Let's go.

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:29.192
What?

01:31:29.775 --> 01:31:31.611
The boy's gone!

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:35.072
Wake up! Get off the train!

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:38.534
Get off the train! The boy's gone!

01:31:38.784 --> 01:31:41.287
The boy just left! Wake Thorenson!

01:31:41.370 --> 01:31:42.747
Get up!

01:31:47.043 --> 01:31:50.546
Get up! Hook up the teams!

01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:53.799
Angus! Angus, have you lost your mind?

01:31:53.925 --> 01:31:58.137
A thousand dollars to the man
that beats that boy!

01:31:58.971 --> 01:32:01.599
Come on! I wanna get this shot lit!
Let's go!

01:32:02.642 --> 01:32:07.855
Open up the gate! Open the gate!
Get my teams out! Do you hear?

01:32:08.147 --> 01:32:09.649
Go, laddies!

01:32:13.903 --> 01:32:17.990
A thousand dollars! Do you hear me?
A thousand dollars

01:32:18.074 --> 01:32:20.576
to the man that catches that boy!

01:33:14.672 --> 01:33:19.593
"Once in a generation an athlete pits
himself against such overwhelming odds

01:33:19.677 --> 01:33:24.640
that even the most jaded spectator
finds himself cheering breathlessly."

01:33:24.849 --> 01:33:28.728
Harry, you're writing from the heart.
Didn't know you had one.

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:32.648
This kid's the genuine article, Lambert.
He's A-1.

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:35.901
He sure gained your respect
with one solid hook.

01:33:36.902 --> 01:33:37.903
You know something, Lambert?

01:33:37.987 --> 01:33:40.865
Last night for the first time since
I've been in the newspaper business,

01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:45.536
I actually felt excited
by what I do for a living.

01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:02.029
That's the finish line right there.

01:35:06.659 --> 01:35:08.661
-Are you Mrs. Stoneman?
-Yes.

01:35:08.744 --> 01:35:10.996
Mrs. Stoneman, Harry Kingsley,
Kane Newspaper Syndicate.

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.873
I've been covering the race.

01:35:13.082 --> 01:35:15.084
Mrs. Stoneman, this is one
of the few times in my life

01:35:15.167 --> 01:35:17.294
that I mean it when I say
it's truly an honor.

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:20.631
-Do you know where Will is?
-That's hard to say exactly.

01:35:20.714 --> 01:35:22.258
Is he all right?

01:35:23.092 --> 01:35:25.094
Mrs. Stoneman, if I know
anything about your son,

01:35:25.177 --> 01:35:27.430
I'll guarantee you he's all right.

01:35:47.783 --> 01:35:50.369
Now it's down to you and me, <i>boyka.</i>

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:53.789
And there's only one chance
left if you want to win.

01:35:53.873 --> 01:35:56.625
There's a shorter trail
down there to St. Paul.

01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:59.420
It's the only way you get there
before the others.

01:36:00.546 --> 01:36:05.342
-Why didn't they go that way?
-You follow me and you'll find out.

01:36:07.928 --> 01:36:10.890
I didn't think you was man enough!

01:36:56.685 --> 01:36:59.563
<i>When you come to face the thing you fear,</i>

01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:01.732
<i>let the Creator guide you.</i>

01:37:11.825 --> 01:37:13.536
<i>Trust the dogs.</i>

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:16.830
<i>Trust yourself.</i>

01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:19.375
Damn you, river.

01:37:20.834 --> 01:37:22.586
I'll beat you.

01:37:23.963 --> 01:37:25.339
You took my father.

01:37:40.062 --> 01:37:41.730
Come on!

01:38:07.756 --> 01:38:10.050
Why you stop? Hey!

01:38:10.134 --> 01:38:12.511
Go on!

01:39:10.194 --> 01:39:12.154
Buster, come back!

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:25.352
First man out is Albert Carey.

01:40:31.316 --> 01:40:32.693
It's Albert Carey.

01:40:48.917 --> 01:40:52.463
Wait a minute. It's Stoneman.

01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:54.798
He's coming out of the woods
a half a mile ahead of the Careys.

01:40:55.299 --> 01:40:56.633
It's Stoneman!

01:41:04.183 --> 01:41:06.018
It's not possible! I don't believe it!

01:41:06.101 --> 01:41:07.978
-Get out your checkbook, you skinflint!

01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:11.315
-Is that my Will?
-The one and only, Iron Will.

01:41:29.792 --> 01:41:31.752
Come on, Will!

01:41:31.835 --> 01:41:34.713
Will, go! Go!

01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:05.035
Will.

01:42:18.549 --> 01:42:20.551
-Oh, God.
-Will.

01:42:33.772 --> 01:42:35.440
Get up.

01:42:58.714 --> 01:43:01.049
Come on, boy! You're almost home!

01:43:02.885 --> 01:43:06.597
-Come on, Will!
-Come on, Will!

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:51.642
Come on, boy, go! Go!

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:44.861
Go!

01:44:47.614 --> 01:44:49.908
-Come on, Will! Go!
-Come on!

01:45:38.248 --> 01:45:40.083
Iron Will!
