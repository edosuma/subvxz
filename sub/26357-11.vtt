the war don't bother me none.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.695
I had a job to do, and I did it.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.865
What secretly helped me was
I enjoyed killing strangers.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.400
Well, tell me
what you think about...

06:40.434 --> 06:42.269
-this!

I brought out the army men.

Stop shooting!

for these army men.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.705

have to start charging you.

And we're done.

Why would being a toy model

07:44.998 --> 07:46.534
be so traumatizing?

07:46.567 --> 07:48.969
Think back, Dad.
Think back.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.204
Mm, I'll do my best.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.206
You know how I hate
to reminisce.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.542

07:59.479 --> 08:02.282
Please, Grampa, back to reality.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.652
Focus on the little green men.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.955

World War had ended

You're talking to a hard-boiled
fighting man.

for every one we sell.

burned down your house,

Don't put me back in!

09:19.392 --> 09:21.929
Uh-huh.
And then what happened?

09:21.962 --> 09:24.598
I... I can't remember.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.899
Did they pay you?

09:25.933 --> 09:28.235
(gasps)
They never did!

09:28.268 --> 09:31.104
Well, that's what's
torturing you.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.706

09:32.740 --> 09:35.442
You could be owed
millions of dollars.

09:35.475 --> 09:39.312
Dad, when was the last time
I said I love you?

09:39.346 --> 09:40.881
I don't have the money yet.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.951

09:53.360 --> 09:56.296
plus savings bonds
that still pay 37%,

09:56.329 --> 09:58.632

forgotten hero no more,
gets tonight's Last Word.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.951
No, you just got the last word.

10:17.985 --> 10:21.855
No, no. You get the last word,
then I say, "Last Word."

10:21.889 --> 10:23.691
You did it again.
Last Word.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.592
It doesn't
work that way. Last Word.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.994
Yes, it does. Last Word.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.362
Don't mess with me, I'm from
Dorchester. Last Word.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.799
I'm from Poorchester.
Last Word.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.200
Turn off the camera
and cut his mic.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.201
Last Wo...

10:34.234 --> 10:36.804
You, sir, are banned
from MSNBC,

10:36.837 --> 10:38.305
CNBC, NBC,

10:38.338 --> 10:41.374
and forbidden from using
the letters N, B, and C.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.642
Last Word.

10:42.676 --> 10:45.645
I'm calling Bret Baier.
Last Word.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.614
He's unlisted. Last Word.

10:47.647 --> 10:51.284
Grampa, you got an e-mail
from the toy company.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.821
They want you to visit them
in New York City,

10:53.854 --> 10:55.723
all expenses paid.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.658
(laughs)
Pay day!

10:58.692 --> 11:00.460
Ooh, I'm gonna be rich!

11:00.493 --> 11:03.196
(gasps) That means I'm gonna
be a trust fund baby.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.632
I'm not paying
for your trip to Aspen.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.969
But it's almost spring break,
and I'm bored.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.005
PILOT: Uh, we are making
our descent into New York,

11:12.039 --> 11:15.976
where there's a happy heart
for every light on Broadway.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.645
Enjoy your fabulous success.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.680
And don't worry
about buckling up

11:20.714 --> 11:24.151
or putting your chairs back--
you're on a roll.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.087
(whispers):
Leave the cart.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.585
-(gasps)
-(groans)

11:58.618 --> 12:01.288
You never called him out
for his bad behavior?

12:01.321 --> 12:04.591
No. But I put mercury
in his coffee.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.626
Oh, don't worry,
he can't hear me.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.096
What are you two doing?
Swapping recipes?

12:09.129 --> 12:11.364
(chuckles)
Sort of.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.400
Let me get you some coffee.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.939
Mister, you owe
my dad a fortune.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.809
'Fraid not. Your Dad
never signed his contract.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.945
You think I left millions
on the table?

12:24.978 --> 12:26.579
That doesn't sound like me.

12:26.613 --> 12:30.117
-Hundreds of millions.
-That sounds like me.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.718
Everything was going great.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.653
Then you ran out
of the photo session.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.789
I didn't even know your name
till this week.

12:35.823 --> 12:39.726
Run away from a fake battle?
Oh, I would never do that.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.062
Oh, yeah? Our photographer,
Philip Hefflin,

12:42.095 --> 12:43.730
could barely finish the session.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.799
Philip Hefflin?

12:45.833 --> 12:48.635
Yes. The finest war
and fashion photographer

12:48.668 --> 12:51.571
-I ever knew.
-(Grampa gasps)

12:51.604 --> 12:53.306
I remember Philip.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.275
He smelled of developing fluid

12:55.308 --> 12:57.610
and Aqua Velva.

12:57.644 --> 13:00.147
We have flashback, people.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.985
("Blue Rondo à la Turk" by the
Dave Brubeck Quartet playing)

13:12.492 --> 13:14.794
Thank you. This is
the most fun I've had

13:14.828 --> 13:16.796
since not dying in the war.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.001
You're my kind of man,

13:21.034 --> 13:22.836
if you know what I mean.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.505
That's not what I meant!

13:25.538 --> 13:27.774
I'm sorry. I thought
you wanted me to...

13:27.807 --> 13:30.777
This is the '40s.
Guys like you don't exist.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.946
We'll just finish the session.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.115
Aah! No!

13:35.148 --> 13:37.284
Stop shooting!

13:37.317 --> 13:40.220
-(panting)
-Where are you going, Soldier?

13:40.253 --> 13:42.489
I got to remind myself
what a real man is.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.726
(sighs)

13:46.759 --> 13:49.462
We found out what happened
and we fired Philip.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.565
-For kissing an employee?
-No, for being gay.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.634
That's just what you did
in the good old days.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.803
Grampa, is that true--

13:56.836 --> 13:59.206
you ruined a man's career?

13:59.239 --> 14:01.808
(cries)
And all he was doing

14:01.841 --> 14:04.344
was expressing his love for me.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.879
Oh, who could blame him?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.052
PILOT: Welcome to
Shattered Dreams Airlines,

14:12.085 --> 14:14.821
where our motto is "What's
the point of going anywhere?"

14:14.854 --> 14:18.425
That poor man. I'll never know
what happened to him.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.161
According to Cyber Stalker.com,

14:21.194 --> 14:23.663
he now lives
in a small town in Texas.

14:23.696 --> 14:27.167
Texas? That's where my friend
Louisiana Joe is from.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.002
MARGE:
Marfa, Texas.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.738
Why don't you go see him
and clear your conscience?

14:31.771 --> 14:35.008
Plus, I always wanted to visit
Texas. It's open carry.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.876
Oh, what do I do?

14:36.910 --> 14:39.846
If I go see him, he might
punch me in the kisser,

14:39.879 --> 14:42.215
or kiss me in the puncher.

14:42.249 --> 14:45.085
-(gunfire)
-Our manhood is
under assault, Sergeant.

14:45.118 --> 14:48.688
-Incoming gay panic!
-(groaning)

14:48.721 --> 14:51.558
(panting)

14:51.591 --> 14:54.527
Abe, promise me one thing.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.264
Go see Philip.
Tell him you're sorry.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.533
Then find my girl
and tell her I loved her.

15:00.567 --> 15:04.304
Find the milkman
and tell him one less milk.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.773
Then find Branch Rickey
and tell him

15:06.806 --> 15:09.943
to integrate baseball.

15:09.977 --> 15:13.113
I have to go to Texas.

15:13.146 --> 15:16.783
-Well, you're not going alone.
-We're all going to Texas.

15:16.816 --> 15:19.419
The plant can get by without me
for a little longer.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.459
WOMAN'S VOICE (on GPS):

It's an art installation.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.807
Marfa is the art capital
of Texas.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.310
Over there are the Marfa lights.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.779
Oh, how magical.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.715
I know, they seem that way,
but there's an explanation.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.951
-It turns out reflected light...
-Don't ruin it.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.119
(humming)

16:26.153 --> 16:28.121
Why are you going
behind the installation?

16:28.155 --> 16:30.457
It's by the side of the road,
so, by definition,

16:30.490 --> 16:32.292
it's a bathroom.

Hello, Abe.

17:59.112 --> 18:02.081
You've aged well,
like a fine onion.

18:02.115 --> 18:05.084
I hope you can forgive
what I did to you.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.254
I'm sorry I ruined your life.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.922
Ruined my life?
You saved it.

18:09.956 --> 18:12.592
-I saved it?
-Let me explain.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.594
After I lost my job,

18:14.627 --> 18:18.097
I decided I'd never live
anything but my truth again.

18:19.132 --> 18:22.135
My wife took it well.

18:22.169 --> 18:25.104
I hit the road and drove
as far as I could.

18:25.138 --> 18:29.041
I landed here and I've never had
a day of regret since.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.112
What's the matter?

18:33.146 --> 18:35.782
You're such a wonderful guy.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.751
Maybe it was my life
that was ruined that day.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.120
It's never too late, Abe.

18:41.154 --> 18:44.857
Never too late to find out
what your true self is.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.194
A paper at Cornell University

18:47.227 --> 18:51.164
has showed that no one
is 100% straight or gay.

18:51.198 --> 18:53.966
-Is it peer reviewed?
-Does it matter?

18:54.000 --> 18:57.103
Ah, I'm afraid I'm too old
to try anything new.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.939
I miss the days
when circuses had elephants

18:59.972 --> 19:01.808
and they stomped on people.

19:01.841 --> 19:05.111
And don't get me started
on Young Sheldon.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.714
Understood, but before you go,

19:07.747 --> 19:10.717
we never did finish
that photo session.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.985
("Blue Rondo à la Turk" by the
Dave Brubeck Quartet playing)

19:20.026 --> 19:23.129
It's a shot I always wanted
and never got:

19:23.162 --> 19:25.131
your beautiful smile.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.666
Why didn't you say so?

19:26.699 --> 19:29.969

I'm gonna remember.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.719
Well?

19:46.753 --> 19:48.888
Sorry, my friend, this army man

19:48.921 --> 19:51.157
is as straight as Gomer Pyle.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.859
(laughs)

19:57.764 --> 19:59.165
Good for you, soldier.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.734
You learned that army men
come in all orientations,

20:01.768 --> 20:05.137
but we're all molded
from the same crappy plastic.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.907
