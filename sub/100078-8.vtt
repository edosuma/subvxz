MAN: Punk bitch.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.678
-They were jumping me in.
-APRIL: Gang initiation.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.972
NOAH: What if you found
somewhere else to stay?

00:13.055 --> 00:14.223
Thank you.

Is this what I think it is?

00:16.392 --> 00:17.393
Fertility chart.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.937
Just seeing the chart is like...

00:20.020 --> 00:21.522
APRIL: You can get a little overzealous.

00:22.106 --> 00:24.442
Okay, my lips are still tingling.

00:30.614 --> 00:32.867
-I'm Ben.
-Maggie.

00:33.159 --> 00:35.161
You know, I should probably eat
an actual lunch after this.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.580
I don't like to eat alone.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.583
This is Ben, my date.

00:43.753 --> 00:45.880
-MAGGIE: What're you doing here?
-Hey.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.507
A patient told me about a peppermint
and ginger aromatherapy,

00:49.258 --> 00:50.509
it's supposed to help with the nausea.

00:50.593 --> 00:52.720
Oh, thank you.

00:53.304 --> 00:55.723
I'm sorry you're having such
a hard time with the chemo.

00:56.307 --> 00:59.894
I'd say it's been a bit more tolerable
now that I have my sidekick.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.353
(LAUGHS)

01:01.437 --> 01:03.939
So, you're the one who's been
stealing my lunch companion?

01:04.523 --> 01:07.735
Guilty as charged. I'm Ben.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.945
-Natalie. Nice to...
-(GRUNTS)

01:10.029 --> 01:12.114
-Ben?
-You all right?

01:13.157 --> 01:15.409
I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:16.619 --> 01:19.371
You look flushed. Maybe you're
coming down with something.

01:19.455 --> 01:21.457
They got me on a new chemo regimen.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.501
I'm always coming down with something.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.628
You know, why don't you pop into the ED
once you're done here?

01:25.711 --> 01:29.840
-I'll just give you a quick exam.
-Thanks, but I'm fine, really.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.593
Don't be stubborn.
I'll make sure he gets there.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.345
All right. See you soon.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.846
Thanks, Nat.

01:39.892 --> 01:41.185
Dr. Sexton.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.687
Wait for me outside.
Hey, Dr. Marcel.

01:44.522 --> 01:46.398
Our distended belly in Two
is non-surgical.

01:46.482 --> 01:47.817
-Sign her over to GI.
-Yeah.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.946
You know, I hate to ask,
but you mind putting in the order?

01:52.029 --> 01:54.073
I just... I gotta run a quick errand.

01:54.156 --> 01:56.826
Oh, is she your errand?
Looks familiar.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.329
Wasn't she here a few weeks ago
with those gang guys?

02:00.412 --> 02:01.580
Uh, she's not with them anymore.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.251
It's true. She's turning her life around.

02:05.334 --> 02:08.504
Oh. Is that why she's wearing
your Blackhawks jacket?

02:10.881 --> 02:13.467
Please tell me that she's not
shacking up with you.

02:13.551 --> 02:14.593
No. No, no, no.

02:14.677 --> 02:17.263
It's not what you think. It's, um...

02:17.346 --> 02:20.015
She's crashing in my guest room
for a couple of days

02:20.099 --> 02:22.059
just until she can get back on her feet.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.395
If you say so.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.814
Okay. I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna take her home.

02:28.190 --> 02:31.986
Would you do me a solid
and just keep this between us?

02:32.069 --> 02:33.153
I don't want April to...

02:33.237 --> 02:34.905
Kick your ass, maybe?

02:35.489 --> 02:36.490
Yeah.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.707
-Measles?
-Nat, are you sure?

02:45.291 --> 02:48.586
The lesions in your mouth,
the elevated fever, the conjunctivitis,

02:48.669 --> 02:50.796
these are all very strong indicators.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.923
I don't understand.
I was vaccinated as a kid.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.718
You've also been on chemo
for six months now.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.595
It's likely wiped out
your vaccine antibodies

02:57.678 --> 02:59.889
and left your immune system
too weak to protect itself.

03:00.598 --> 03:03.642
So, do I need to suspend chemo
while we treat this?

03:03.726 --> 03:05.102
(INHALES)

03:05.185 --> 03:06.770
I'd like to speak with your oncologist.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.356
But my guess is yes.

03:10.024 --> 03:13.527
Will I be okay? I mean, people
get over measles all the time.

03:13.611 --> 03:15.738
Yes, they do. I mean,
we can manage this, right?

03:15.821 --> 03:16.864
Put him on bedrest,

03:16.947 --> 03:19.992
make sure he doesn't develop
any secondary infections.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.118
Ideally, yes.

03:22.244 --> 03:23.245
But?

03:24.163 --> 03:26.707
I did hear congestion in your lungs.

03:26.790 --> 03:31.128
Which means that, most likely,
you've already developed pneumonia.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.380
So, what happens next?

03:34.423 --> 03:36.091
With your weakened immune system,

03:36.175 --> 03:37.718
I'm afraid it's only a matter of time

03:37.801 --> 03:39.929
before the virus starts
attacking your other organs.

03:40.012 --> 03:43.766
Wait, are you saying
this is gonna kill me?

03:43.849 --> 03:45.559
Measles are gonna kill me?

03:50.397 --> 03:51.440
I'm so sorry, Ben.

03:52.691 --> 03:57.196
Nat, there has to be something...

04:00.866 --> 04:02.409
How long am I looking at?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.244
Months?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.790
Weeks?

04:09.208 --> 04:10.292
Days?

04:11.251 --> 04:14.755
If what I suspect is true, I'm afraid so.

-Morning, Daniel.
-Morning.

04:31.772 --> 04:35.150
I haven't seen CeCe in a couple of days,
how's she doing?

04:36.193 --> 04:38.612
You know, not too thrilled that I keep on
leaving my dishes in the sink

04:38.696 --> 04:40.531
but other than that, hanging in there.

04:40.614 --> 04:44.660
You think she'd be up for a drink tonight?
Just the four of us?

04:44.743 --> 04:46.578
-The four of us?
-Yeah.

04:46.662 --> 04:50.124
Turns out, Bert and I met a few times.

04:50.207 --> 04:53.252
Just for a couple of drinks,
don't get too excited.

04:53.335 --> 04:56.672
-He still has a lot of explaining to do.
-Okay.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.632
And I just figured that maybe

04:58.716 --> 05:01.552
CeCe would get a kick out
of all of us getting together.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.512
Are you kidding me? She'd love it.

05:03.595 --> 05:06.181
I'm just warning you, you're gonna get
a big "I told you so."

05:06.265 --> 05:09.977
Yeah, well. I'm looking
forward to that. (CHUCKLES)

05:12.146 --> 05:13.272

all her questions.

-Nice to meet you.

why don't you start there?

-Maggie, go be with Ben.
-Thank you.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.093
-He stepped out.
-Where?

Said something about an errand.
I got him covered.

about six weeks ago.

at your incision site?

No edema in the lower extremities.

Great.

Lori, you had any fever, night sweats,
chills over the past few days?

07:06.093 --> 07:08.303
No. Since I got the kidney, I feel great.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.973
Okay. I did hear a little congestion.

-Honey, them about your cough.
-Dad, I'm fine.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.479
Well, it is possible
you developed an infection in your lungs.

07:17.563 --> 07:20.524
-An infection?
-Yeah, it's a common post-op complication.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.485
-Curry, what do you think?
-We should probably start with a CBC,

07:23.569 --> 07:27.656
BMP, chest X-ray, and give 500 milligrams
empiric azithromycin.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.492

make sure her kidney's okay.

the source of the bleed.

Can I have a word with you
and Dr. Choi, please?

I'll call the OR, tell them
we're bringing him up.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.481
They write all of their songs
using Fibonacci's sequence,

so, every note is the sum total
of the two notes before it.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.350
WILL: We're gonna find out.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.064
There's a clot blocking
blood flow out of the kidney,

14:16.147 --> 14:18.149
that's likely what made her
collapse this morning.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.359
I thought it was an infection.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.736
Kidney dysfunction can mimic
signs of an infection.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.280
So, what do we do?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.574
There's a drug called tPA
that should break up the clot,

14:25.657 --> 14:28.868
but we'll need a CT first
to pinpoint its location.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.662
-Tell radiology we're bringing her up.
-No, wait.

14:30.745 --> 14:34.583
You cannot give her a CT scan,
she's allergic to the contrast.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.001
You're sure she's allergic?

14:36.084 --> 14:39.296
She had a CT scan before her transplant
and had a really bad reaction.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.589
-It almost killed her.
-(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)

14:40.672 --> 14:42.716
The transplant center must have not put
that in her chart.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.260
You have the ultrasound,
can't you use that to locate the clot?

14:45.343 --> 14:47.387
Ultrasound doesn't
give us it detailed enough.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.473
We can't inject the medication
without a precise location on CT.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.975
Please, make it stop.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.852
Isn't there something else you can do?

14:53.935 --> 14:56.104
We could try to get a CT
by using a high dose of steroids

14:56.187 --> 14:57.981
to suppress her allergy.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.733
Yeah, but she could go
into anaphylactic shock.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.277
No. I'm not putting her
through that again.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.862
Do we have an alternative?

15:07.616 --> 15:08.617
All right. We'll put her on heparin,

15:08.700 --> 15:10.619
wait to see if the clot
resolves on its own.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.412
At this point, it's our best option.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.873
Bolus 1,000 units of heparin,
50 mics of fentanyl for the pain

15:14.956 --> 15:17.083

17:01.521 --> 17:02.772
What do you mean?

17:02.856 --> 17:05.275
We need to keep Ben here,
under quarantine.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.987
Why? Hospital protocol
is if a patient has measles,

17:09.070 --> 17:12.031
that they can self-quarantine as long as
they don't take public transportation.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.117
Yes. Under normal circumstances.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.119
But there's a citywide outbreak.

17:16.202 --> 17:20.331
The county health officer has
issued a mandatory quarantine

17:20.415 --> 17:22.333
for all hospitalized patients.

17:22.417 --> 17:26.296
Ben will have to remain here until he's
no longer contagious.

17:26.379 --> 17:30.049

all the time he has left.

that you are putting your life in danger.

the decision he's making.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.488
Yeah. But he's not making the decision.

19:15.572 --> 19:18.533
True, but, he's willingly
allowing other people to do that for him.

19:18.616 --> 19:20.577
He's denying surgery
to boost his online following,

19:20.660 --> 19:22.328
how can we say he doesn't
pose a risk to himself?

19:22.412 --> 19:25.623
Well, just 'cause he's reckless,
doesn't mean he's suicidal. You know?

but I can't discharge him.

23:15.103 --> 23:17.355
We just got Lori's
latest set of labs back.

23:19.065 --> 23:21.109
Her creatinine has risen dramatically.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.653
What does that mean?

23:23.736 --> 23:25.530
The heparin isn't working.

23:26.239 --> 23:29.408
Lori, I'm sorry, your kidney
is in serious distress.

23:29.492 --> 23:30.535
No.

23:31.202 --> 23:34.789
Since we're unable to get the CT needed
to inject the tPA,

23:35.957 --> 23:37.625
I'm afraid there's not much more we can do
to save your kidney.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.127
Oh, God...

23:39.710 --> 23:42.839
There's still dialysis and you can go back
on the transplant list...

23:42.922 --> 23:44.882
No, I can't go through that again.

23:44.966 --> 23:46.634
Please, there has to be another way.

23:46.717 --> 23:47.969
I wish there was, but...

23:48.052 --> 23:49.345
What about the thing
you were saying earlier?

23:49.428 --> 23:50.972
About suppressing my allergy?

23:51.848 --> 23:53.474
Well, there is a chance
we could prevent

23:53.558 --> 23:55.518
an allergic reaction to the CT contrast

23:55.601 --> 23:57.854
by loading you up with a high enough
dose of steroids.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.106
-That would be extremely risky.
-I wanna do it.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.693
You could... You could go
into anaphylactic shock.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.154
I spent too much time
on the transplant list.

24:06.237 --> 24:09.907
The pain, and the fever,
and the sleepless nights.

24:09.991 --> 24:11.159
I can't go through that again.

24:11.242 --> 24:14.203
-But honey...
-I can't go back on dialysis.

24:18.416 --> 24:20.501
Lori, I would need your parents' consent.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.881
Please, I... I can't lose this kidney.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.799
Lori.

24:28.009 --> 24:29.093
Okay.

24:29.802 --> 24:30.887
Dad?

24:34.056 --> 24:35.183
You have our consent.

24:37.935 --> 24:38.936
All right.

24:41.230 --> 24:44.192
Hey. You can't do this.
She could die in the scanner.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.987
Elsa, I understand the risk,
but we have to try.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.781
Why? I mean, even if she loses her kidney,

24:50.865 --> 24:53.784
she can still survive on dialysis
until a new organ is available.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.703
She could also spend years
suffering on dialysis

24:55.786 --> 24:58.039
and still die before getting
another transplant.

24:59.457 --> 25:02.126
This is what Lori wants,
we have parental consent.

25:13.387 --> 25:14.847
Two, maybe three minutes ago.

25:15.598 --> 25:18.059
We need to get him to the OR now.
He's gonna crash.

What are you talking about?
His vitals are stable.

25:19.977 --> 25:22.146
Not for long. Pulse pressure's narrowing,

25:22.230 --> 25:24.273
heart rate's climbing
and his lips are turning blue.

25:24.357 --> 25:25.900
I've seen this before.
Means a crash is coming.

25:25.983 --> 25:28.653
No. We almost have control of the bleed.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.863
If we wait until his pressure drops,
it'll be too late.

We gotta stop this. I'm almost there.

25:42.458 --> 25:43.626
Dr. Marcel, you need to back off.

When that happens,
it may be too late to save you.

we'll get you a nice warm bath,

35:05.020 --> 35:06.939
and a neb treatment.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.692
There you go.

35:13.362 --> 35:15.197
(CHILDREN SCREAMING PLAYFULLY)

35:27.334 --> 35:28.877
Maggie.

35:31.839 --> 35:33.090
It's okay.

35:35.592 --> 35:36.927
Let's go back.

35:46.895 --> 35:47.896
I found it.

35:49.439 --> 35:50.983
The short gastrics are still bleeding.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.486
I don't have the angle,
can you clamp them from your side?

35:54.570 --> 35:56.280
Yes, sir. Hemostat.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.407
Better hustle,
I can't keep his pressure up.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.616
Don't rush me, Marty.

36:04.538 --> 36:06.582
Got it. Two-oh silk stitch.

36:07.916 --> 36:11.253
Pressure's improving.
Nice work, Crockett.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.467
MARCEL: Let's tie this off and close.

36:18.260 --> 36:20.345
(WHIRRING)

36:26.268 --> 36:27.811
Get him quarantined, now.

36:31.315 --> 36:33.400
You forged my signature?

36:34.401 --> 36:35.444
I'm sorry, Nat.

36:36.445 --> 36:38.614
I didn't know what else to do. I...

36:39.656 --> 36:40.741
I couldn't turn my back on him.

36:40.824 --> 36:43.410
That doesn't give you
the right to endanger the public.

36:43.493 --> 36:45.871
(SOBBING) I realized that as soon
as I stepped outside but...

36:49.416 --> 36:52.336
I can't believe you did this, Maggie.

36:52.419 --> 36:53.629
(SIGHS)

36:56.423 --> 36:58.050
I'm sorry.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.469
-Go, be with him.
-(SNIFFLES)

37:11.063 --> 37:13.398
-How's he doing?
-The appendectomy went well.

37:13.982 --> 37:15.984
The surgeon expects him
to make a full recovery.

37:16.068 --> 37:17.110
Great.

37:18.779 --> 37:20.280
Daniel, what's going on?

37:20.364 --> 37:24.076
Can you please explain to me
why there's a video showing

37:24.159 --> 37:28.080
my chief of psychiatry asking a patient
to jump off the roof?

37:28.163 --> 37:30.832
I realize that the optics aren't good.

37:30.916 --> 37:34.878
You're supposed to be mitigating
psychiatric crises, not creating them.

37:34.962 --> 37:36.254
What if he had tried to jump?

37:36.838 --> 37:39.132
First of all, Sharon, there was never
any danger of that happening.

37:39.216 --> 37:42.219
But if it had, I would've put him
on a psych hold and mandated the surgery.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.262
This video's going viral.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.265
What happens if the Tribune picks it up?

37:47.849 --> 37:48.850
Wouldn't be good.

37:48.934 --> 37:49.935
No.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.980
I'll see you tonight.

37:56.817 --> 37:58.485
Hey, you're Elsa, right?

37:58.568 --> 38:00.195
Uh, these concert tickets
just came off the printer.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.363
Your name is on 'em.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.365
Thanks. I was just about to grab 'em.

38:04.408 --> 38:05.409
How was your first day?

38:06.284 --> 38:07.327
Um...

38:07.411 --> 38:09.496
Great. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Everyone was so helpful.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.456
Uh, excuse me.

38:11.540 --> 38:14.167
Um, Will... Sorry. Dr. Halstead,

38:14.251 --> 38:16.336
-I was just wondering if maybe you...
-There you are!

38:16.420 --> 38:18.463
Somebody promised me
a Stoli Up, extra dirty.

38:19.756 --> 38:21.425
-Ready to go?
-Definitely.

38:22.259 --> 38:24.386
WILL: Juliette, this is Elsa,
fourth year med student.

38:24.469 --> 38:27.431
-Juliette's one of our new paramedics.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

38:27.514 --> 38:28.557
Mmm-hmm.

38:29.808 --> 38:33.186
-Yeah, did you need something?
-No, no, no. Uh, it's nothing important.

38:33.854 --> 38:34.855
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:35.647 --> 38:36.732
-All right, you bet. Good night.
-Good night.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.483
-Let's go.
-All right.

38:43.947 --> 38:44.990
(SIGHS)

38:48.618 --> 38:52.497
Hank, do you call this a decent pillow?

38:53.331 --> 38:54.875
It's all that was left in central supply.

38:54.958 --> 38:57.627
Then you go to plastics
and you find me some silicone.

38:57.711 --> 38:58.962
I don't care how you do it.

38:59.046 --> 39:01.131
Let's make this patient comfortable.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.729
Hey, Daniel.

39:15.812 --> 39:18.648
Hey. Where's CeCe?

39:19.316 --> 39:24.029
You cannot imagine how excited she was
when I told her about tonight.

39:24.112 --> 39:28.033
But she just wasn't up to it.

39:29.910 --> 39:34.081
Did, however, absolutely insist
that I join you.

39:34.164 --> 39:36.666
So, how about a quick drink?

39:36.750 --> 39:38.293
Sounds good.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.628
Good to see you.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.714
Please get this young man
whatever he's drinking.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.891
Hey, hey. You're gonna be okay.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.521
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)

39:58.355 --> 40:00.232
Hey, April?

40:02.734 --> 40:03.944
I'm here.

40:06.321 --> 40:07.322
I'm right here.

40:08.323 --> 40:10.033
Just get some rest, okay?

40:20.544 --> 40:22.087
I'll check back in a while.

40:32.514 --> 40:33.723
Hey, Crockett.

40:37.561 --> 40:38.603
Thank you.

I'm just glad he's okay.
