WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.240
That was horrible.

00:04.280 --> 00:08.440
You should be able to handcuff
your kids to the airplane seat.

00:08.480 --> 00:11.720
They'd be all "waaah" for a
minute, and then they'd be fine.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.320
Have a super trip to Vermont!

00:14.780 --> 00:16.960
Hope you get trampled by a moose.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.440
- What a monster.
- I know! I mean, what was her problem?

00:20.480 --> 00:22.600
Frankie only threw up on
her two or three times.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.640
If she didn't want kids talking to her,

00:24.680 --> 00:26.680
she shouldn't have worn
a fucking Shrek jumper.

00:27.289 --> 00:29.480
Oh, God, I need to stop for a second.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.510
I'm so tired I could cry.

00:33.550 --> 00:35.680
Well, put on your sunglasses and cry!

00:35.720 --> 00:38.440
I can't. Muireann popped
one of the lenses out.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.640
Oh, honey!

00:41.840 --> 00:44.560
- Sir?
- Hm?

00:45.260 --> 00:47.360
Oh, shit. Thanks.

00:49.980 --> 00:52.440
We'll get it in a minute!

00:57.600 --> 00:58.720
Hey!

00:58.760 --> 01:00.440
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:01.240 --> 01:03.320
Get over here.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.920
Hey!

01:05.920 --> 01:08.040
Hi!

01:10.160 --> 01:12.600
- What is that smell?
- It's us.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.460
Oh. Well, it's at least...
great to see you.

01:16.500 --> 01:17.960
OK. Let's go.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.400
- Let's hit the beach!
- Yes!

01:21.440 --> 01:22.820
OK.

01:30.684 --> 01:31.800
Is that the radio?

01:33.650 --> 01:35.360
Mom's dead!

01:35.400 --> 01:37.960
- She died!
- What?

01:40.080 --> 01:42.480
- Come on!
- No!

01:43.080 --> 01:46.200
- What? No. What? I don't...
- What?

01:46.240 --> 01:49.200
I talked to her right
before we got on the plane!

01:49.240 --> 01:52.000
She asked me to bring
her Colman's Mustard!

01:52.040 --> 01:55.240
I... I found her in her
bedroom this morning!

01:55.280 --> 01:57.520
- What happened?
- I don't know yet.

01:57.560 --> 02:00.080
We think it's probably a heart attack.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074

02:09.080 --> 02:11.400
- Do you want me to drive?
- No.

02:11.440 --> 02:14.720
OK. All good.

02:19.320 --> 02:22.000
Did the paramedics try
to resuscitate her?

02:22.040 --> 02:26.560
They did not. She was
cold when they got here.

02:26.600 --> 02:30.080
Did they try everything? I
mean, should I go up there

02:30.120 --> 02:32.320
- and try to...
- No!

02:33.480 --> 02:35.120
Hey.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.602
- Oh!
- Mm.

02:38.642 --> 02:40.160
Are you OK?

02:40.200 --> 02:41.720
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.120
- You know.
- Yeah.

02:43.160 --> 02:46.200
Um, Pat, this is my brother Rob.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.240
- Oh!
- And this is my Sharon.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.280
This is Rob's Sharon. This is Sharon.

02:51.320 --> 02:56.000
Rob... I am so sorry for your loss.

02:56.940 --> 02:58.560
Thank you.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.501
- It's terrible.
- Yeah.

03:00.541 --> 03:02.320
It's just... terrible.

03:02.820 --> 03:04.800
Did you tell 'em about last night?

03:04.840 --> 03:08.160
She just... She didn't
seem herself to me.

03:08.200 --> 03:11.840
- She didn't seem herself... to you?
- Not to me.

03:11.880 --> 03:16.160
No. We were... having
soup from Five Corners.

03:16.200 --> 03:20.760
She loves their soup. And so
we were just in the kitchen,

03:20.800 --> 03:23.440
- slurping on that.
- Oh!

03:23.480 --> 03:26.240
But her eyes seemed cloudy to me.

03:26.780 --> 03:29.120
And she said...

03:29.940 --> 03:32.800
She... She said a couple of
times how tired she was.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.560
Oh!

03:36.600 --> 03:39.400
All right. I'm gonna
go get us some lunch.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.733
Thank you.

03:40.773 --> 03:45.140
Mia said you were a big corned-beef
guy when you were a kid.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.160
- You still like corned beef?
- I'm gonna go see my mom now.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.920
All right. Well, I'll just get
a few different meats, then,

03:52.960 --> 03:55.243
- just to be safe.
- Yes.

03:55.283 --> 03:56.925
All right.

04:08.740 --> 04:11.000
People die when we visit.

04:11.380 --> 04:14.120
Your dad died when we went to Ireland,

04:14.160 --> 04:16.160
and now my mom.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.399
I mean, we can Skype or
write letters to your mom,

04:19.440 --> 04:23.240
but if we visit her... she'll die.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.520
We have a dark power.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.880
What?

04:28.920 --> 04:31.400
I was just wondering if there
was anyone we SHOULD visit.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.400
Maybe we should visit Fergal.

04:36.893 --> 04:38.014
That's not funny.

04:40.154 --> 04:41.960
It's nice seeing you laugh.

04:43.840 --> 04:47.920
She looked kind of beautiful,
didn't she, lying there.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.440
She really did.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.720
Do you think Pat went up there
and did her hair and makeup?

04:56.060 --> 04:57.840
Huh?

04:57.880 --> 04:59.040
No.

04:59.080 --> 05:02.600
I dunno. Sounds like they
had a pretty great rapport.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.360
I don't like that he was
here when she died.

05:06.980 --> 05:09.440
Fuckin' grief vampire.

05:09.480 --> 05:11.880
What do you think his problem is?

05:11.920 --> 05:14.560
What do I think his problem is?!

05:14.600 --> 05:17.640
What, that he loves your sister
and he seems really kind,

05:17.680 --> 05:19.680
and he made us that great lunch?

05:19.720 --> 05:21.840
He put meat on a tray.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.840
Yeah, but I think he
smoked that meat himself.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.280
I'll fuckin' smoke HIS meat.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.760
When do you think the service will be?

05:34.800 --> 05:36.560
We're aiming for Friday.

05:37.580 --> 05:40.240
We might need to stick around
for a few days afterwards,

05:40.280 --> 05:43.480
- just to help sort out her affairs.
- OK.

05:44.140 --> 05:45.960
How long do you think that will take?

05:46.340 --> 05:47.680
I dunno.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.760
- But approximately?
- I dunno!

05:51.800 --> 05:55.120
- So I should cancel the hotel?
- Yup.

05:56.460 --> 05:58.890
Do you think you still might
want to go down to the beach?

05:58.930 --> 06:01.600
- I don't know!
- OK, honey. I was just... you know.

06:01.640 --> 06:04.920
- It might be good for the kids.
- Yeah, well, I tell you what.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.040
Why don't you go to the beach,

06:08.065 --> 06:11.585
and I'll stay here and
go to my mom's funeral.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.080
I'm gonna go to your mom's funeral!

06:15.120 --> 06:18.160
Just after that, maybe we
should go to the beach.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.960
You'll still be sad. Just...
why not be sad on the beach?

06:22.000 --> 06:25.340
- I'll still be sad?
- I'll be sad too...

06:26.380 --> 06:27.880
...at the beach.

06:39.320 --> 06:40.510
Looks great!

06:40.550 --> 06:43.522
Oh! It's for my mother-in-law's funeral.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.067
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:00.107 --> 07:01.280
How'd you get on?

07:01.320 --> 07:04.080
- You get a nice suit?
- Probably four sizes too big,

07:04.120 --> 07:07.320
but it was 75 bucks, so...
Did you get that dress?

07:07.360 --> 07:11.360
Yeah. I got the blue bikini as
well, because it was so cheap.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.440
Also, you never know.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.080
There's another swimsuit
store up here I saw.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.377
- I wanted to have a look. Do you mind?
- Rob! Rob Norris?

07:19.417 --> 07:20.545
Tim?

07:21.520 --> 07:23.800
- How you doing, man?
- What's up?

07:23.840 --> 07:26.480
Oh, wow! Hey, Sharon,

07:26.520 --> 07:29.320
this is Tim Cabot. We worked
together for years at Frye and Loeb.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.560
- Tim, this is my wife Sharon.
- Hi, Tim.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.880
Sharon! I had a little girlfriend
in fat camp called Sharon.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.640
- You're not from Toronto, are you?
- Er, no!

07:38.680 --> 07:39.902
I'll take your word for it.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.520
- How you doing, man?
- Pretty good, you know?

07:44.560 --> 07:48.193
Started my own business. Got tired
of making those donkeys rich.

07:48.233 --> 07:49.720
What the hell are you doing back here?

07:49.760 --> 07:52.349
Did London kick you out once they
found out you were a bigamist?

07:53.570 --> 07:57.040
N... No. Um, my mom died yesterday.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.960
Holy shit! I am sorry to hear that.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.200
Yeah, my mom died 11 years ago.
It sucks not having a mom.

08:04.240 --> 08:07.800
I don't care that I'm 56.
I still want my mommy!

08:09.440 --> 08:12.363
Listen, let's get together
when it's a better time.

08:12.403 --> 08:14.122
- OK.
- Maybe Sharon could

08:14.162 --> 08:15.560
fall in love with Boston,

08:15.600 --> 08:17.920
and I could entice you
to come work for me.

08:18.960 --> 08:22.800
Unless you don't like box seats
at Fenway or lobster Fridays!

08:22.840 --> 08:24.523
I like those things.

08:24.563 --> 08:26.454
Oh! Got ya.

08:26.494 --> 08:28.360
- All right, man.
- Listen, I gotta roll. Gimme a call.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.995
- OK.
- Sharon.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.440
Oh, man! Wow!

08:35.179 --> 08:38.000
Still mourning after 11 years. Wow!

08:38.625 --> 08:41.000
Yeah, looks that way. Guess
you better not ask HIM

08:41.039 --> 08:43.159
to go bikini shopping with you.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.440
What's that supposed to
mean? Is that a dig at me?

08:46.480 --> 08:48.258
I'm devastated too, you know.

08:48.298 --> 08:50.240
And, worse, you're inconvenienced.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.920
Honey!

08:52.340 --> 08:55.424
I feel awful for you. Of course I do.

08:55.464 --> 08:57.960
And for me. Really awful, but...

08:58.000 --> 09:02.084
Am I sad for us, that it
happened on our family holiday?

09:02.124 --> 09:05.760
Yeah! I'm sorry, but I am.
We've had a really tough year,

09:05.800 --> 09:08.200
and it's just horrible luck.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.440
Yeah. I hear what you're saying.
It is sad about the holiday.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.600
Why don't you take that
feeling and put it in a box,

09:14.640 --> 09:17.960
and then try and kick it up your
own asshole while I bury my mom?

09:30.200 --> 09:31.880
Oh, sweetheart!

09:34.080 --> 09:36.720
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you, Jan.

09:36.760 --> 09:40.960
I know Mia was looking forward to
seeing Frankie and, er, the girl.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.400
- Muireann.
- Moo... Yes. Of course. Mm-hm.

09:44.440 --> 09:48.240
Hi. I'm Sharon. Very sad.

09:49.560 --> 09:52.063
Bobby, can I talk to you for a second?

09:52.103 --> 09:53.246
Yeah?

09:53.286 --> 09:55.640
- Your dad's here.
- Oh!

09:55.680 --> 09:58.123
- Wow!
- Sydney won't come out of her room.

09:58.163 --> 09:59.181
She doesn't wanna see him.

09:59.221 --> 10:00.888
- Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

10:00.928 --> 10:04.840
He's been in there for 20 minutes.
I think he's taking a shower.

10:04.880 --> 10:09.080
But when he gets out, probably
best we ask him to leave.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.120
Let's just hit the brakes
there for a second.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.680
There's the big guy!

10:16.560 --> 10:20.520
I know who YOU are.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.760
Welcome to New England.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.760
So, is Rob showing you a good time?

10:26.800 --> 10:28.840
Well, we've been getting
ready for the funeral.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.633
Make sure he takes you to
Woodman's for some fried clams.

10:31.673 --> 10:32.739
OK.

10:32.779 --> 10:35.120
Hey! Who's this little guy?

10:35.160 --> 10:37.920
Er, that's your grandson.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.160
Well, how about that?

10:40.200 --> 10:44.840
Hey, are you OK? I mean,
you look a little yellow.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.520
Oh, yeah. It's a little cirrhosis.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.880
- I'm on some list for a new liver.
- Jesus!

10:50.920 --> 10:53.697
I wanna be honest, I'm not
priority, but why should I be?

10:53.737 --> 10:56.520
I always rode it hard
and put it away wet.

10:56.560 --> 10:59.960
Anyways, good news about Brexit, huh?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.436
Oh, I forgot. You're a bigot.

11:02.476 --> 11:04.360
Oh, come on. It's just about borders.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.520
What, you gonna build a
house without walls?

11:06.560 --> 11:07.651
It'd be nuts!

11:08.180 --> 11:10.960
Plus it'll give your cousins
in the IRA something to do.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.180
What?!

11:14.520 --> 11:17.600
We don't owe him anything. He wasn't
even there when you were born.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.440
He met you when you were four days old.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.480
Fuckin' asshole. You know who WAS there?

11:22.520 --> 11:24.560
I was there! I was five.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.524
I'm not telling you what to do,

11:26.564 --> 11:29.000
but if you told him you forgive him,

11:29.040 --> 11:31.680
even if you don't mean
it, you'll feel better,

11:31.720 --> 11:33.210
cos he's gonna die soon.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.240
You can forgive someone
when they're dead.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.560
Yeah, exactly! I'm not on his timeline.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.040
He chose to live that way.
You reap what you sow.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.880
Oh, God. My uncle had cirrhosis.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.420
It was disgusting. It was a bad end.

11:50.780 --> 11:52.040
Thank you.

11:54.320 --> 11:57.560
I'm right here. Whatever you need.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.840
In a lot of ways she was a great mom.

12:13.380 --> 12:16.347
She used to cook us
casseroles in the morning.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.587
She'd read somewhere that breakfast

12:18.612 --> 12:20.892
was the most important meal of the day,

12:20.947 --> 12:23.427
so she used to get up at 5:00 AM

12:23.452 --> 12:26.532
and prep a big pot of
meat and vegetables,

12:26.587 --> 12:28.987
and we'd just sit there
and sweat and eat it.

12:29.027 --> 12:31.107
And she did good deeds, too.

12:31.147 --> 12:33.867
We found that out when we
were going through her stuff.

12:33.907 --> 12:36.222
She raised money for spinal surgeries

12:36.262 --> 12:38.625
for kids through her eBay sales.

12:39.172 --> 12:41.707
There's just a button on
eBay where you can donate,

12:41.747 --> 12:46.507
and that's what she did. Her
friend Sally gave me an email

12:46.547 --> 12:50.307
that she sent her. I'll read it.

13:01.347 --> 13:05.747
"I heard about these babies. Their
spines are like corkscrews,

13:05.787 --> 13:08.667
but once they have these
surgeries, it's beautiful."

13:08.707 --> 13:11.107
"They can play hockey or rollerblade."

13:11.147 --> 13:12.987
"I mean, I wouldn't have to do it at all

13:13.027 --> 13:16.505
if this government gave a rat's
ass about disabled kids."

13:16.705 --> 13:19.027
"They'd be happy to just
throw 'em out the window."

13:19.540 --> 13:21.587
"I bet Mike Pence spends his Sundays

13:21.627 --> 13:23.547
throwing disabled kids out of windows."

13:23.587 --> 13:24.874
"Looks like he would,

13:24.914 --> 13:28.107
that fuckin' microwaved-apple
lookin' ass motherfucker."

13:31.467 --> 13:34.827
I'd go on, but it gets worse.

13:36.427 --> 13:41.627
Please join us at Archie's
for fried stuff and drinks.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.220
Thank you.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.628
Oh, honey!

13:52.907 --> 13:54.065
I dunno why I'm...

13:54.105 --> 13:56.027
- You miss her.
- Oh, no.

13:56.067 --> 13:57.747
Yeah.

14:11.067 --> 14:14.987
I hated Obama, but I respect him.
You'd think after eight years,

14:15.027 --> 14:17.707
he'd wanna put his feet up,
instead of spending all that time

14:17.747 --> 14:21.187
- organising fake school shootings.
- Jesus!

14:21.227 --> 14:23.987
Why are you here, outside of
looking for a donor liver?

14:24.027 --> 14:26.747
I'm here to pay my respects to your mom.

14:26.787 --> 14:28.157
- Oh, really?
- Really.

14:28.197 --> 14:29.257
Really?

14:29.297 --> 14:32.827
- You look like a fuckin' Minion.
- I don't even know what that is.

14:32.867 --> 14:34.907
Is that bad?

14:34.947 --> 14:36.667
Is it?

14:38.747 --> 14:40.067
What?

14:40.107 --> 14:42.427
Oh, for God's sake!

14:42.467 --> 14:45.427
Oh, God!

14:45.906 --> 14:47.506
Oh!

14:49.806 --> 14:51.610
Did you see my dad fuckin'
followed us here?

14:51.650 --> 14:53.147
Yeah.

14:54.620 --> 14:57.692
He's probably filling his
pockets with chowder crackers.

14:59.545 --> 15:00.667
Are you OK?

15:00.707 --> 15:04.187
- Yeah. Sorry. I'm just...
- Oh!

15:04.227 --> 15:06.267
I didn't realise you loved her so much.

15:06.307 --> 15:09.427
No, I didn't. I'm just... Sorry!

15:09.467 --> 15:11.747
You just keep talking,
cos I gotta take a whiz.

15:11.787 --> 15:14.347
Ugh! I think maybe it's...

15:14.780 --> 15:17.467
I think maybe it's jetlag
or something, you know?

15:17.507 --> 15:19.507
- Oh...
- Shit!

15:19.940 --> 15:21.947
Do you have a tampon?

15:21.987 --> 15:25.507
Um, no. I don't think so.
I haven't had my, um...

15:34.874 --> 15:37.394
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

15:37.434 --> 15:41.114
My period's four days late.
Hang on. Is today Wednesday?

15:41.154 --> 15:44.474
- No. It's Friday.
- It's six days late!

15:51.434 --> 15:54.514
I haven't been to a funeral in
quite a while. I usually skip 'em.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.634
Really? Is this the first
funeral you've been to

15:57.674 --> 16:00.714
where you broke the jar of
the deceased while drunk?

16:01.260 --> 16:02.874
She told you about that?

16:02.914 --> 16:04.034
Yeah.

16:04.780 --> 16:06.994
Well, I thought about that a lot, and...

16:07.034 --> 16:11.540
all's I can say is, I hit her way
less than my dad hit my mom.

16:12.074 --> 16:15.274
And I spoke to Sharon, and she
says you don't hit her at all,

16:15.314 --> 16:18.274
so... it's all going in
the right direction.

16:19.874 --> 16:21.500
And look at that little guy.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.434
He's gonna be even better than you.

16:28.234 --> 16:31.594
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

16:36.274 --> 16:40.354
Er... what do you wanna
do about your dad?

16:40.394 --> 16:44.394
He upsets Sydney, and...
he's quite yellow.

16:44.434 --> 16:46.241
Are we taking his word for it

16:46.281 --> 16:48.275
that he's not contagious with all that?

16:49.194 --> 16:52.914
Look, Pat, you seem like a great guy,

16:52.954 --> 16:55.994
or at least Sydney thinks that you are.

16:56.034 --> 16:57.637
But as far as I'm concerned,

16:57.677 --> 17:00.154
you're just some guy
that I met yesterday,

17:00.194 --> 17:02.874
who's sticking his nose
into my family's asshole.

17:03.460 --> 17:06.434
- I know you're upset.
- That's some insight there, Dr Phil.

17:06.473 --> 17:08.753
So I'm not gonna take offence to that.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.914
Would you rather take
offence to me telling you

17:10.954 --> 17:13.434
to shut your Guy Smiley muppet-hole

17:13.473 --> 17:15.794
and fuck off behind
that plant over there?

17:16.260 --> 17:17.502
- Rob...
- All right, man.

17:17.542 --> 17:18.569
Agh!

17:18.609 --> 17:20.674
Oh, great! Good work, Pat!

17:20.714 --> 17:23.273
Oh, my God... Oh, what? Shit!

17:23.314 --> 17:25.753
You know, you should probably
get HER contact info

17:25.794 --> 17:27.553
so you can be there when she dies.

17:27.593 --> 17:29.860
Share a cup of soup with
her on her deathbed

17:29.900 --> 17:32.207
while her kids are banging
on the window to be let in.

17:32.247 --> 17:34.200
OK. Maybe you should go
outside and get some air.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.035
- I'd like that!
- Great.

17:36.060 --> 17:37.794
I'm very sorry.

17:39.035 --> 17:40.258
Hello?

17:43.154 --> 17:44.295
Are you OK?

17:44.335 --> 17:47.554
Yeah. It's just been a long day.

17:48.060 --> 17:49.976
Tim Cabot called me earlier.

17:50.016 --> 17:51.544
Who?

17:51.584 --> 17:53.634
The guy you went to fat
camp with in Toronto.

17:53.674 --> 17:55.674
Oh, Tim!

17:55.714 --> 17:58.754
- What did he want?
- He offered me a job.

17:59.220 --> 18:00.954
A really good one.

18:00.994 --> 18:04.234
- Wow! That's gotta feel nice.
- Yeah, it does.

18:04.274 --> 18:06.714
- And frustrating.
- Why?

18:07.714 --> 18:11.634
- Well, since you can't take it.
- Why? Why can't I take it?

18:11.674 --> 18:13.954
Because we don't live here.

18:13.994 --> 18:17.554
But we could. I mean, why not?
It'd be like a new adventure.

18:17.594 --> 18:21.834
The kids'd love it, you know, and
if we sold our place in London,

18:21.874 --> 18:24.834
we could pay cash for a house
in Swampscott, Massachusetts.

18:24.874 --> 18:27.274
I don't wanna live somewhere
called Swampscott.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.714
All right, then. Saugus!

18:29.754 --> 18:34.154
Jesus, who names these places?
I just wanna get home, OK?

18:34.194 --> 18:35.785
I just wanna get back to normal.

18:35.825 --> 18:37.954
Look, I uprooted my life for you

18:37.994 --> 18:41.354
and moved away from my family,
and now my mom is dead.

18:41.394 --> 18:45.714
My dad's old, and the biggest organ
in his body is shutting off.

18:45.754 --> 18:49.474
And my sister seems
strong, but she needs me.

18:49.514 --> 18:53.154
Yeah, but they know you have a
family in London that needs you too,

18:53.194 --> 18:55.434
and also... they've got Pat now.

18:57.594 --> 19:00.034
OK. We could argue about this all night,

19:00.074 --> 19:02.314
but I'm taking the job,
and we're staying.

19:02.354 --> 19:04.714
You can't just tell me what I'm doing.

19:04.754 --> 19:07.914
- I'm not a fuckin' handmaid.
- Whoa, whoa. When I said "we",

19:07.954 --> 19:09.955
I meant me and the kids.

19:09.995 --> 19:11.388
What?

19:11.428 --> 19:13.142
I mean, you could be a part of our "we",

19:13.182 --> 19:15.195
or you could just as easily fuck off,

19:15.235 --> 19:16.954
but I'm staying here with the kids.

19:16.994 --> 19:18.386
OK, I know you're grieving,

19:18.426 --> 19:21.475
and in a little while you'll
feel really bad and apologise,

19:21.515 --> 19:24.385
but even suggesting I live in a
different country from my kids

19:24.425 --> 19:26.874
is a good way to get the ball
rolling on your own funeral.

19:26.914 --> 19:29.714
And I don't mean to sound
psychopathic, but I will kill you.

19:29.754 --> 19:32.154
I fuckin' dare you to kill me.

19:32.194 --> 19:35.234
You wouldn't last a minute, trying
to raise these kids on your own.

19:35.274 --> 19:37.460
Do you know how hard I would
laugh if you killed me?

19:37.500 --> 19:41.514
- Ha! Not as hard as me.
- Oh, it'd be a welcome relief.

19:41.554 --> 19:44.274
From the day I met you, I've
struggled to make you happy,

19:44.314 --> 19:46.754
and it never works. Have
you ever done one thing,

19:46.794 --> 19:48.794
I mean, one thing, just for me?

19:48.834 --> 19:52.994
What, other than grow and feed
and raise all of your babies?

19:53.034 --> 19:55.170
- Other than that.
- Countless blow jobs.

19:55.210 --> 20:00.531
Countless?! I'm pretty sure I can
count to 23 over four years.

20:00.571 --> 20:03.463
- I get claustrophobic!
- Well, you know what?

20:03.503 --> 20:05.914
You're mean and you're selfish
and nobody likes you.

20:05.954 --> 20:08.114
Oh, is that so? Well,
I don't really care.

20:08.154 --> 20:10.314
More importantly, I don't like you.

20:26.514 --> 20:29.994
"Hi, this is Fergal.
Please leave a message."

20:45.074 --> 20:47.354
Is everything OK with you guys?

20:47.394 --> 20:50.914
Well, I'm not sure I have
a short answer for that.

20:58.994 --> 21:00.674
Listen.

21:00.714 --> 21:04.034
I called Dad, and we're
gonna have lunch next week,

21:04.074 --> 21:06.634
so... Yeah.

21:06.674 --> 21:08.208
If I can do that,

21:08.248 --> 21:10.954
I think you can sort things
out with Sharon, right?

21:10.994 --> 21:14.747
Oh! Er, I have something
for you, before you leave.

21:14.787 --> 21:16.100
OK, wait.

21:17.274 --> 21:20.074
Listen, er...

21:20.114 --> 21:22.234
I don't wanna bother Rob with this,

21:22.274 --> 21:24.274
but can you let him know that...

21:24.314 --> 21:26.994
I'm sorry if I tried to
take the wheel too much.

21:27.034 --> 21:30.394
Yeah. I might have to mail
it to him in a letter,

21:30.434 --> 21:32.954
cos he's not talking to
me right now, but sure.

21:32.994 --> 21:34.789
And anyway, don't worry about it.

21:34.829 --> 21:36.161
- You've been great.
- Ahh.

21:36.201 --> 21:39.474
- You're a real rock for Sydney.
- Well, I try to be.

21:40.434 --> 21:42.470
I think that's what Rob needs, too.

21:43.280 --> 21:44.440
A rock.

21:45.234 --> 21:48.074
Huh? I'm a rock.

21:48.960 --> 21:52.129
- I'm his rock.
- Oh! Okey-dokey.

21:52.154 --> 21:54.874
- Yeah.
- Yeah! Of course.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.154
Hey!

21:59.194 --> 22:01.954
So, this came last night. I
thought you'd wanna have it,

22:01.994 --> 22:04.234
cos she bought it before she died.

22:04.274 --> 22:07.034
She's been falling asleep in the
middle of her eBay auctions.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.834
She bought a ceramic banana
last week for $1,500

22:10.874 --> 22:12.994
cos she conked out on the re-bid button.

22:33.674 --> 22:36.274
- I'm sorry, Pat.
- Nn-nn.

22:36.314 --> 22:37.954
Aww!

22:58.794 --> 23:02.074
- Can you pull over?
- Yeah. Are you OK?

23:02.114 --> 23:04.794
Yeah. Just wanna tell you something.

23:11.354 --> 23:13.394
It's weird, you know. When you're here,

23:13.434 --> 23:16.954
you don't feel like you're in a
white-nationalist ethno-state

23:16.994 --> 23:19.674
run by a fake pee-cratic dictator.

23:21.194 --> 23:23.172
You just feel like you're
on a pretty beach.

23:23.212 --> 23:24.274
Yeah.

23:24.314 --> 23:25.900
You'd never know.

23:28.314 --> 23:32.154
I'm sorry that you find it a
struggle to make me happy.

23:33.514 --> 23:35.954
Because really, you make
me happy every day.

23:37.394 --> 23:39.274
I mean most days.

23:39.314 --> 23:43.274
Honey, I seriously didn't mean
those awful things that I said.

23:43.314 --> 23:47.114
I just thought, you know,
"What would be meanest?"

23:47.154 --> 23:48.940
Yeah, but I get why you said it.

23:49.434 --> 23:52.114
So let's do it, you know?

23:52.900 --> 23:54.354
Let's move here.

23:55.354 --> 23:57.434
We could have a good life here.

23:57.474 --> 24:01.634
Look, I'm a husk of a man.

24:01.674 --> 24:04.234
And if you wanna be with this,

24:04.274 --> 24:06.674
then, I don't care where we do it.

24:06.714 --> 24:11.154
It could be London or
Boston or fuckin' Cairo.

24:11.194 --> 24:15.554
Just tell me where to be
and when, and I'll do it.

24:17.660 --> 24:19.594
I'm pregnant.

24:21.554 --> 24:25.674
I know. I saw the test in the trash can.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.834
You left it, like, on top
of the pile of trash,

24:28.874 --> 24:32.114
and I figured it wasn't
Sydney's or my mom's.

24:32.154 --> 24:33.540
Oh, God!

24:34.434 --> 24:36.020
What do you think?

24:36.474 --> 24:39.034
- I threw up when I saw it.
- Yeah. Me, too.

24:41.140 --> 24:43.234
But then I thought...

24:43.740 --> 24:45.274
why not?

24:45.314 --> 24:48.514
I mean, it could be fun.
What do you think?

24:50.594 --> 24:53.954
Yesterday I definitely didn't wanna
have any more of your children,

24:53.994 --> 24:57.034
but... I mean, now, sitting here,

24:57.940 --> 24:59.940
and you look so handsome...

25:00.394 --> 25:02.354
I really wanna have it.

25:02.394 --> 25:05.754
I really wanna push out
a tiny little baby

25:05.794 --> 25:08.220
and just kiss it and smell it.

25:12.900 --> 25:15.994
- Can I ask you something?
- I didn't fart.

25:16.034 --> 25:19.794
There's an algae here that smells
like... It smells like my farts.

25:19.834 --> 25:21.140
No. Just...

25:22.834 --> 25:25.074
...do you think we would've
ended up together?

25:25.114 --> 25:28.260
I mean, if you hadn't've got
me pregnant the first time.

25:29.674 --> 25:31.674
If I met you right now,

25:32.100 --> 25:34.514
I'd still wanna fuck you for a week,
