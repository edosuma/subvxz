04:10.656 --> 04:12.989
Eels rioted last night in Denver,

04:12.991 --> 04:14.991
demanding medicine, travel permits,

04:14.993 --> 04:16.959
and full access to the 9.

04:16.962 --> 04:20.596
Twelve Eels were arrested and all
the graffiti was found and burned.

04:20.599 --> 04:22.590
Meanwhile, here in Ohio,

04:22.593 --> 04:25.669
a warehouse full of graffiti
was found outside of Cleveland,

04:25.671 --> 04:28.546
including a rare discovery
of pens and paper...

04:28.549 --> 04:31.140
- Yuxie, MiPhotos.
- Here ya go, Montag.

04:31.142 --> 04:33.075
Your fans are waiting on the 9.

04:33.077 --> 04:34.877
Two Firemen were sent to the hospital

04:34.879 --> 04:36.412
with minor injuries.

04:36.414 --> 04:38.514
Fire Commissioner Nyari
released a statement:

04:38.516 --> 04:40.616
"Our elected officials will not allow

04:40.618 --> 04:42.017
the happiness of our great state

04:42.019 --> 04:43.586
to be threatened by evil Eels.

04:43.588 --> 04:45.903
Our Firemen will defend our democracy."

04:45.906 --> 04:48.143
Great choice. You'll look good in those.

04:48.146 --> 04:49.681
And now for the Happiness Index,

04:49.683 --> 04:52.127
we go to Arthur Link.

05:05.109 --> 05:08.377
You like that?

05:10.014 --> 05:12.214
Oh!

05:14.285 --> 05:15.684
Ohh!

05:19.565 --> 05:20.856
Oh!

05:24.761 --> 05:26.428
Ohh!

05:26.430 --> 05:30.601
- There she blows.
- Yeah, Captain, yeah!

05:30.604 --> 05:33.102
When you have a "why" to fight,

05:33.104 --> 05:35.104
you can bear almost any "how."

05:35.106 --> 05:37.639
I'll give you a "why."
You knocked my tooth out.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.641
You're too pretty, anyway.

05:40.978 --> 05:43.078
Lemme see.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.747
Eh. You can keep it that way.

05:45.749 --> 05:48.517
Everything you lose comes
around in another form.

05:48.519 --> 05:50.985
I'll get the doc to
print me up another one.

05:50.987 --> 05:53.388
Eels are bad.

05:53.390 --> 05:55.056
They're dangerous,

05:55.058 --> 05:56.924
and they want chaos

05:56.926 --> 05:59.491
in your hearts and your minds.

05:59.494 --> 06:01.529
They want to make you unhappy.

06:01.531 --> 06:03.364
Eels try to upload graffiti

06:03.366 --> 06:05.601
to the Dark 9 before we can burn it.

06:05.604 --> 06:09.003
What should these young
Natives do, Master Trooper?

06:09.005 --> 06:10.471
Stay vivid on the 9.

06:10.473 --> 06:13.141
If you see something, say something.

06:13.143 --> 06:16.277
Eels say we limit information. Lies!

06:16.279 --> 06:17.525
Master Trooper Montag,

06:17.528 --> 06:19.728
can you read any book you want on the 9?

06:19.731 --> 06:21.482
Sir, any book, sir.

06:21.484 --> 06:24.185
Yuxie, show us some classics.

06:24.187 --> 06:27.355
The Bible...

06:27.357 --> 06:30.391
"To the Lighthouse"...

06:30.393 --> 06:32.560
and "Moby Dick."

06:32.562 --> 06:34.127
This is all you need to know.

06:34.129 --> 06:36.597
Anything else will make you sick, crazy.

06:36.599 --> 06:38.532
And that's why we're here.

06:38.534 --> 06:40.233
To protect you

06:40.235 --> 06:43.871
and to keep you safe and happy.

06:43.873 --> 06:47.408
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

06:47.411 --> 06:48.544
Please rise.

06:50.813 --> 06:53.380
Happiness is truth!

06:53.382 --> 06:55.549
Freedom is choice!

06:55.551 --> 06:58.518
Self is strength!

07:02.524 --> 07:04.024
Don't worry, don't worry,

07:04.026 --> 07:06.326
these are for training
purposes only, OK?

07:07.262 --> 07:08.729
Now, have any of you guys

07:08.731 --> 07:11.131
ever seen one of these
bad things for real?

07:11.133 --> 07:12.900
No!

07:12.902 --> 07:15.868
We burned almost every
physical book in the country.

07:15.870 --> 07:21.407
So by the time you guys grow
up, there won't be one book left.

07:21.409 --> 07:24.343
He should probably raise his
hands a little higher, right?

07:24.345 --> 07:25.712
I might miss.

07:41.630 --> 07:43.896
Whoo!

07:46.801 --> 07:48.534
This is not a drill!

07:48.536 --> 07:50.003
We've got Eels on the move!

07:50.005 --> 07:51.804
We got Eels slipping away!

07:51.806 --> 07:53.606
- Move! Move! Move!
- Let's ride!

07:53.608 --> 07:56.275
Check all gear! Let's go, let's go!

07:56.277 --> 07:58.110
Let's go! This is why we train!

07:58.112 --> 08:00.178
Let's burn, let's burn, let's burn!

08:09.256 --> 08:11.931
♪ Down the red-hot valley, lo! ♪

08:11.934 --> 08:13.992

- Salamander!
- Ho!

08:41.821 --> 08:44.905
- Holy sh...!

08:44.908 --> 08:46.359
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

08:46.361 --> 08:47.692
Kyle! Joe! Around back!

08:47.694 --> 08:49.538
Have us a good, old-fashioned barbecue!

08:49.541 --> 08:52.374
Captain wants since Eel
soup! Let's do it, boys!

08:52.377 --> 08:54.799
- Type, man.
- What do I upload? Wiki pages?

08:54.801 --> 08:57.073
- Shakespeare? Coltrane?
- I gotta get to the servers. Save what you can.

08:57.075 --> 08:58.803
Guys, it's game time.
Y'all know what to do.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.397
Freeze! Don't move!

09:05.044 --> 09:07.445
- Montag, upstairs!
- I got him!

09:07.447 --> 09:10.446
- Don't make me chase after you!
- Hold him down!

09:10.449 --> 09:12.094
Everybody stay right where you are!

09:15.555 --> 09:18.022
Hey, drop the cord!

09:19.759 --> 09:23.594
Come on. Yeah.

09:23.596 --> 09:26.391
- Aah! Aaah!
- Hey.

09:26.394 --> 09:27.865
Come on.

09:32.705 --> 09:34.571
You dream about hiding from me!

09:34.573 --> 09:36.540
You better wake up and apologize.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.342
Hey, Captain, wanna come get some?

09:38.344 --> 09:40.211
Go check the other rooms.

09:43.415 --> 09:45.116
Are you done?

10:05.775 --> 10:07.508
What are you waitin' for?

10:07.511 --> 10:09.210
Waitin' on you.

10:16.882 --> 10:18.282
Good evening, Cleveland,

10:18.284 --> 10:19.923
and welcome to tonight's fire show.

10:19.926 --> 10:22.452
Captain Beatty and his
Master Trooper Montag

10:22.454 --> 10:25.254
have uncovered Eels
pretending to be Natives.

10:25.257 --> 10:27.743
What punishment would you
like to see here tonight?

10:27.746 --> 10:29.124
Welcome, Natives,

10:29.126 --> 10:31.087
and everybody at home watchin' on the 9.

10:31.090 --> 10:34.129
Look what we found hiding in
your beautiful neighborhood.

10:36.267 --> 10:38.891
Eels don't deserve
freedom, now, do they?

10:38.894 --> 10:41.136
- No!
- We won't let 'em take our jobs

10:41.139 --> 10:43.274
and steal our tax money, now, will we?

10:43.277 --> 10:45.633
Hell, no! Self is strength!

10:45.636 --> 10:47.109
Happiness is truth!

10:47.111 --> 10:49.210
Guess what time it is?

10:49.213 --> 10:52.015
Time to burn for America again!

10:53.518 --> 10:55.551
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait. No, no.

10:55.553 --> 10:57.085
No, no. Wait.

10:57.087 --> 10:59.454
Stone! Reprint.

11:01.091 --> 11:02.791
Yuxie, +10 years.

11:02.793 --> 11:05.327
Identity deletion commencing.

11:10.034 --> 11:13.302
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Delete his identity!

11:16.273 --> 11:18.740
- Ban his travel.
- Get that money, too.

11:23.147 --> 11:25.647
Enjoy your new life as an Eel.

11:28.919 --> 11:32.086
I'm not fire... I'm fire +100.

11:32.088 --> 11:34.321
I'm molten lava on graffiti.

11:34.324 --> 11:37.126
They call me a walking
incinerator for happiness.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.923
Damn, it's a pleasure to burn!

11:38.926 --> 11:41.766
Everybody watching at home
on the 9, are you ready?

11:41.769 --> 11:43.430
Burn 'em, Montag!

11:53.209 --> 11:55.809
Take that, Eels! Take that!

12:59.740 --> 13:01.140
Hey.

13:01.142 --> 13:02.942
You're still high on
kerosene, aren't you?

13:02.944 --> 13:04.843
I can smell it from
here. Let's get goin'.

13:09.283 --> 13:12.558
- Where we headed?
- A little after-hours trip.

13:12.561 --> 13:14.320
You hear from Major Curtis?

13:15.522 --> 13:17.556
It's happening. End of the year.

13:17.558 --> 13:19.658
Oh! I knew it.

13:19.660 --> 13:21.292
- "Major Beatty."
- Yeah.

13:21.294 --> 13:23.061
I'm gonna miss your
ugly mug around here.

13:23.063 --> 13:25.168
Yeah. You'll finally become me.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.898
No, no, no. Not become you.

13:26.900 --> 13:30.234
I'm gonna be Captain
motherfuckin' Montag.

13:56.629 --> 13:59.097
There she is.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.077
Don't worry, I'll talk to her this time.

14:01.080 --> 14:04.202
Keep your dick in your
pants and stand guard.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.515
Well, well, well. Clarisse.

14:07.518 --> 14:09.655
I hope you're not
wasting my time tonight.

14:09.658 --> 14:12.676
Your last tip led me to
Boy Scouts with pornos.

14:12.678 --> 14:15.013
Reactivate my fingers
like you said you would.

14:15.015 --> 14:18.016
Feed me scraps, and I'll
delete your travel permit.

14:18.018 --> 14:19.955
That's bullshit. You need me.

14:23.356 --> 14:26.424
How many years did we restrict you? Six?

14:26.426 --> 14:29.159
After all the tips I gave
you, I should be free.

14:29.161 --> 14:31.428
A beautiful, free rat.

14:34.314 --> 14:36.366
Take a year off my sentence,

14:36.368 --> 14:38.168
and I'll give you something you like.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.837
Six months. But it better be good.

14:49.625 --> 14:51.491
I didn't hear the captain
say you could leave.

14:51.494 --> 14:54.060
Yeah? How come he always
makes you wait outside

14:54.063 --> 14:56.030
like a little dog, huh?

14:58.939 --> 15:00.728
You're just like Beatty.

15:00.731 --> 15:03.069
I'm not like Beatty.

15:03.072 --> 15:06.041
- Everyone has a master.
- Not me.

15:06.044 --> 15:08.531
You spy on me, but
you never do anything.

15:11.336 --> 15:14.604
- Why do I always make you nervous?
- You don't.

15:14.607 --> 15:17.475
When I see you burning up Eel's
lives, you don't look nervous.

15:17.478 --> 15:20.209
That's because I'm very good at my job.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.778
Hmm.

15:21.780 --> 15:24.647
Have you ever thought,
even for one second,

15:24.649 --> 15:26.549
why you do what you do?

15:27.986 --> 15:31.220
You should try reading before burning.

15:31.222 --> 15:32.789
See you around, Montag.

15:35.961 --> 15:37.727
Hey.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.462
Off limits.

15:39.464 --> 15:42.465
Let's go. She recommended a spot.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.035
Captain Beatty, I...
I have my permits, sir,

15:47.037 --> 15:49.638
- all one hundred.
- I can't wait to see 'em.

15:51.274 --> 15:55.343
See if you can find
me a new pair of shoes.

15:58.549 --> 15:59.982
Captain.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.563
Well, look what I found.

16:08.445 --> 16:10.171
You guys must think you're pretty slick.

16:10.174 --> 16:12.358
Sit down. Don't move.

16:12.361 --> 16:15.497
Have they uploaded to the 9?

16:16.566 --> 16:19.033
Nah. Just this monitor.

16:19.035 --> 16:21.769
Hit "play." Do it.

16:21.771 --> 16:25.273
Let's see what they have to say.

16:25.275 --> 16:28.843
Before bots and the rise
of automated writing,

16:28.845 --> 16:31.379
we had jobs for journalists...

16:31.381 --> 16:33.515
someday.

16:33.517 --> 16:35.883
She'd spend weeks, sometimes months,

16:35.885 --> 16:38.085
investigating a story,

16:38.088 --> 16:40.421
and then she'd publish
a series of articl...

16:40.424 --> 16:43.525
dreds, even thousands of words long

16:43.527 --> 16:45.026
on physical paper

16:45.028 --> 16:48.530
and the Internet, or the 9, today,

16:48.532 --> 16:51.799
which everyone was free to read.

16:51.801 --> 16:53.515
But nobody was reading anymore,

16:53.518 --> 16:55.670
or they were just
glancing at the headlines

16:55.672 --> 16:57.452
generated by an algorithm...

16:57.455 --> 16:59.506
Thousands of words? Ugh.

16:59.508 --> 17:01.742
In your pathetic time,
were people happy?

17:01.744 --> 17:04.145
No. There were so many
millions of opinions

17:04.146 --> 17:06.724
that our country slid
into the Second Civil War.

17:06.728 --> 17:09.750
Eight million dead, including my father.

17:09.752 --> 17:11.616
Your father must have been old enough

17:11.618 --> 17:15.321
to remember a time when
firemen put fires out

17:15.324 --> 17:16.924
instead of starting them.

17:16.925 --> 17:20.661
- Hey!
- Just relax, all right?

17:20.663 --> 17:22.496
Benjamin Franklin,

17:22.498 --> 17:25.165
the founder of our
first fire department,

17:25.167 --> 17:26.701
gave us the right to burn.

17:26.703 --> 17:28.735
Those are lies.

17:28.737 --> 17:31.132
Ben Franklin did not do that.

17:31.135 --> 17:34.140
After the last of your generation dies,

17:34.143 --> 17:36.943
so will your words...

17:36.945 --> 17:38.912
your memories...

17:38.914 --> 17:42.150
and the burden of your fake past.

17:42.153 --> 17:44.077
Even in their self-hours,

17:44.080 --> 17:46.319
Captain Beatty and Master Trooper Montag

17:46.321 --> 17:47.577
keep Cleveland safe.

17:47.580 --> 17:49.756
Let's give them a +100 salute.

17:49.758 --> 17:53.280
Do your part. See something,
say something. Tell Yuxie.

17:53.283 --> 17:55.772
Meanwhile, Firemen outside
of Buffalo, New York,

17:55.775 --> 17:58.522
captured Eels attempting to
cross the border into Canada.

17:58.525 --> 18:01.766
There has been an increase in illegal
migration, and local fire stations...

18:01.769 --> 18:04.336
When you become a captain,
you have to know more.

18:04.338 --> 18:07.072
You'll get to read more.

18:07.074 --> 18:09.283
So you've read entire books.

18:11.145 --> 18:12.777
Yeah, but the Ministry, of course,

18:12.779 --> 18:14.475
they have complete works, right?

18:14.478 --> 18:16.448
I don't know.

18:16.450 --> 18:19.384
I suppose when they
make me District Major

18:19.386 --> 18:21.021
they'll throw me a few more scraps,

18:21.024 --> 18:22.708
but the Ministry's...

18:25.726 --> 18:31.230
How can we see anything but
the fire shadows in the cave...

18:31.247 --> 18:34.647
if we're never allowed
to move our heads?

18:36.670 --> 18:38.135
What does that mean?

18:39.372 --> 18:41.605
Nothin'

18:41.607 --> 18:44.242
You're as impatient as I
was when I was your age.

18:44.244 --> 18:48.812
Yeah. I just wonder
how much my dad knew.

18:48.814 --> 18:51.282
- He was a great Fireman.
- Damn right he was.

18:51.284 --> 18:53.955
- And a friend.
- Fuckin' Eels.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.611
He was a hero.

18:58.683 --> 19:01.251
Same as you'll be, Guy Montag!

19:01.261 --> 19:02.385
I am a hero.

19:02.388 --> 19:04.288
Hmm.

19:04.291 --> 19:05.958
I am a hero.

19:08.034 --> 19:12.102
♪ Down the red-hot valley, lo! ♪

19:12.104 --> 19:15.109
♪ The phantom armies marching go ♪

19:15.112 --> 19:17.908
- There we go!
-  ♪ Salamander ho! ♪

19:17.910 --> 19:21.137
♪ Salamander ho! ♪

19:21.140 --> 19:23.374
♪ Ignite the tomes... ♪

19:23.377 --> 19:25.299
Do things yourself!

19:25.302 --> 19:26.991
Keep this sponge alive!

19:26.994 --> 19:29.219
Thus endeth tonight's lesson.

19:29.221 --> 19:33.056
♪ Salamander ho!  ♪
♪ Salamander ho! ♪

19:54.178 --> 19:55.710
It's a DD series.

20:00.984 --> 20:04.319
It works. I put in a new belt myself.

20:07.758 --> 20:09.135
What do you have for me?

20:09.138 --> 20:12.194
There is an abandoned house
out in the woods near Bedford.

20:12.196 --> 20:14.296
It's a drop-off spot for graffiti.

20:14.298 --> 20:17.032
- Does anyone live there?
- No, I don't think so.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.184
Yuxie, Firemen.

20:37.186 --> 20:39.719
Did we used to put out fires?

20:39.721 --> 20:41.921
That's a classic Eel lie.

20:41.923 --> 20:43.590
And Benjamin Franklin.

20:43.592 --> 20:46.626
Founder of our first fire department.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.066
What's wrong, Montag?

20:53.068 --> 20:55.335
Nothin'.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.670
Your vitals have been off recently.

20:57.672 --> 20:59.638
I'm going to reconfigure your cocktail

20:59.640 --> 21:01.874
and have new drops delivered.

21:01.876 --> 21:03.709
That's fine.

21:11.219 --> 21:14.086
John, have you used your drops today?

21:16.891 --> 21:18.724
Yuxie, go dark.

21:20.094 --> 21:21.494
I'm secure now.

22:53.384 --> 22:55.184
Clarisse?

22:55.186 --> 22:57.823
Haven't had milk all week. Thanks.

22:57.826 --> 22:59.659
Sorry, I couldn't find any cooking oil.

22:59.662 --> 23:01.289
- That's OK.
- Hey, Clarisse?

23:01.292 --> 23:03.159
Be careful what you're selling.

23:03.161 --> 23:04.760
People are talking.

24:47.730 --> 24:49.429
Yuxie, go dark.

24:49.431 --> 24:52.199
I'm secure now, Montag.

26:09.518 --> 26:12.593
Signal lost. Entering a black hole.

26:12.596 --> 26:15.721
Set a transponder so Raven can find us.

26:17.983 --> 26:21.118
Transponder set.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.553
Did Clarisse tell you about this spot?

26:59.825 --> 27:01.157
Douglas.

27:03.061 --> 27:05.161
Freeman, check around back.

27:10.735 --> 27:12.901
Stone!

27:12.904 --> 27:15.846
- Joel, Kyle, clear this room!
- Yes, sir.

27:31.890 --> 27:34.639
Montag, get that tumor Eel on her feet.

27:34.642 --> 27:36.010
The rest of you search the house.

27:36.013 --> 27:37.579
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

27:39.361 --> 27:40.960
How many of you are there?

27:43.830 --> 27:45.318
How many?

27:50.907 --> 27:52.740
"Grapes of Wrath."

27:52.743 --> 27:54.376
Hmm. Get her up.

27:54.378 --> 27:57.780
You heard the captain. Up. On your feet.

27:57.782 --> 27:59.937
How many more of these do you have,

27:59.940 --> 28:01.617
Ma Joad?

28:06.055 --> 28:09.089
If you can read, you can talk.

28:09.092 --> 28:11.727
Play the man, Master Ridley.

28:11.729 --> 28:15.499
We shall this day light such
a candle, by God's grace,

28:15.502 --> 28:17.733
as I trust shall never be put out.

28:17.735 --> 28:19.334
Captain Beatty!

28:19.336 --> 28:21.869
You're never gonna
believe what we found, sir.

28:21.871 --> 28:23.638
You gotta get up here.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.340
Phelps, keep eyes on her.

29:03.412 --> 29:06.909
This is gonna be the most important
burn the country has ever seen, sir.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.248
Go see if Raven
followed the transponder.

29:09.251 --> 29:11.551
- But sir...
- You just heard the captain.

29:11.553 --> 29:12.919
Now move.

29:19.061 --> 29:21.628
A regular damn Tower Of Babel.

29:23.966 --> 29:26.737
I've only seen something
like this once in my career,

29:26.740 --> 29:28.973
when I was a cadet.

29:28.976 --> 29:31.411
Have you ever seen a
physical book before?

29:34.910 --> 29:36.743
Hmm.

29:41.951 --> 29:46.186
Kafka. A pornographer
and a sexual pervert.

29:46.189 --> 29:48.023
I like that about him.

29:48.026 --> 29:50.089
Have you read that book?

29:50.091 --> 29:53.226
Every Fireman sooner or
later wants to know...

29:53.228 --> 29:54.928
what the Eels know,

29:54.930 --> 29:58.565
what's in all this
graffiti that we burn.

30:02.237 --> 30:03.736
You want to hold it?

30:05.327 --> 30:06.526
Go on.

30:06.529 --> 30:09.130
Before the men come back.

30:16.551 --> 30:18.451
Open it.

30:25.660 --> 30:27.259
Read.

30:27.354 --> 30:29.429
Read.

30:31.398 --> 30:33.131
Read.

30:40.666 --> 30:45.078
Do you want to know what's
inside all these books?

30:46.614 --> 30:48.480
Insanity.

30:48.482 --> 30:52.517
The Eels want to measure their place

30:52.519 --> 30:54.588
in the universe,

30:54.591 --> 30:57.992
so they turn to these novels

30:57.995 --> 31:01.491
about non-existent people.

31:01.494 --> 31:04.796
Or worse, philosophers.
Look, here's Spinoza.

31:04.798 --> 31:07.966
One expert screaming down
another expert's throat.

31:07.968 --> 31:11.903
"We have free will." "No, all of
our actions are predetermined."

31:11.905 --> 31:14.639
Each one says the opposite,

31:14.641 --> 31:18.142
and a man comes away lost,

31:18.144 --> 31:22.805
feeling more... bestial
and lonely than before.

31:22.808 --> 31:25.741
Now, if you don't want a person unhappy,

31:25.744 --> 31:29.320
you don't give them two sides
of a question to worry about.

31:29.322 --> 31:31.656
- Just give 'em one.
- Better yet, none.

31:34.093 --> 31:36.727
Ah. See?

31:36.729 --> 31:38.229
"Huck Finn"...

31:38.231 --> 31:40.577
and his "nigger" friend.

31:40.580 --> 31:44.435
The whites knew that you blacks
were offended, so what did we do?

31:44.438 --> 31:46.438
We burned it.

31:48.508 --> 31:51.108
Oh.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.955
And then "Native Son" came along,

31:52.958 --> 31:56.180
and the whites didn't appreciate
that one all that much,

31:56.182 --> 31:58.149
so they burned it, too.

31:58.151 --> 31:59.916
Why didn't they like it?

32:04.423 --> 32:06.823
Henry Miller, Hemingway.

32:06.825 --> 32:08.687
The feminists don't approve,

32:08.690 --> 32:12.262
so into the flames they go.

32:12.264 --> 32:15.866
You see, we are not born equal, Guy,

32:15.868 --> 32:18.702
so we must be made equal by the fire,

32:18.704 --> 32:22.706
and then... we can be happy.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.943
So, we burn.

32:29.548 --> 32:32.549
Well, let's clear all this
filth out of here and...

32:32.551 --> 32:34.740
get the fire show started with.

32:34.743 --> 32:36.043
Shall we?

32:38.223 --> 32:40.123
But take one last look.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.658
You may never see
anything like this again.

32:44.628 --> 32:48.630
Your grandchildren won't even
understand what a book is.

33:23.509 --> 33:26.177
Can you tell us anything
about what's inside?

33:26.180 --> 33:29.604
Nothing that can't burn at 451 degrees.

33:29.606 --> 33:31.556
And there you have it...

34:10.737 --> 34:12.235
Montag.

34:12.239 --> 34:14.406
Let's get her out of here.

34:14.409 --> 34:16.074
Come on.

34:21.697 --> 34:22.862
Let's go.

34:24.092 --> 34:26.359
Lady, this whole house
is gonna get torched.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.219
And me, with my books.

34:28.222 --> 34:29.351
Let's go.

34:29.355 --> 34:30.496
Montag, never mind.

34:30.498 --> 34:32.399
Just get over here, please.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.567
Captain, we're just gonna leave her?

34:34.569 --> 34:36.835
Get over here now.

34:40.145 --> 34:42.279
Look, miss, you can do what you like,

34:42.282 --> 34:45.679
but you know as well as I do
these books are gonna burn.

35:00.428 --> 35:01.760
No.

35:15.843 --> 35:17.275
Omnis.

36:57.309 --> 36:59.008
Omnis.

36:59.010 --> 37:01.196
The Ministry has wiped
out the word "omnis"

37:01.199 --> 37:03.678
from across the 9.

37:03.681 --> 37:06.181
This coward is not
going to become a martyr

37:06.183 --> 37:08.784
before we find out what the
hell she's shouting about.

37:08.786 --> 37:11.386
Captain Beatty, perhaps you can explain

37:11.388 --> 37:14.732
why you let this Eel start a bonfire?

37:14.735 --> 37:17.852
We didn't know she had a
match, sir, and the kerosene...

37:17.855 --> 37:19.594
Major Curtis spoke highly of you.

37:19.597 --> 37:21.997
I hope I can come to understand why.

37:21.999 --> 37:25.935
After "Beatty's Barbecue," our
team reported the word "omnis"

37:25.937 --> 37:29.004
appearing in unusually
high numbers on the Dark 9.

37:29.006 --> 37:31.950
If an Eel is going to
blow herself up for it,

37:31.953 --> 37:33.909
we need to get ahead of it.

37:35.813 --> 37:38.157
the first self-fire in Ohio's history,

37:38.160 --> 37:39.757
and only the fourth in the nation.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.219
This marks a new low in Eel actions

37:42.222 --> 37:43.688
threatening our happiness.

37:43.691 --> 37:46.164
Details about this
tumor Eel are coming in.

37:46.167 --> 37:47.900
She lived alone in the woods,

37:47.903 --> 37:49.936
without Yuxie, like a wild animal,

37:49.939 --> 37:52.425
and suffered from a +100 mental illness,

37:52.428 --> 37:55.396
a result of extreme
exposure to reading graffiti.

37:56.819 --> 37:58.552
Coward!

37:58.555 --> 38:01.302
We will be updating you
as more details come in.

38:03.573 --> 38:05.473
Whoa.

38:05.475 --> 38:06.908
You all right?

38:06.910 --> 38:08.275
Always.

38:08.277 --> 38:10.044
Life of a Master Trooper, huh?

38:16.853 --> 38:18.786
Montag.

38:22.057 --> 38:25.392
You hesitated tonight
in front of the men.

38:26.862 --> 38:28.729
I know.

38:28.731 --> 38:30.731
But it won't happen again.

38:30.733 --> 38:34.467
You know, it's my first
time seeing a self-burn, too.

38:36.539 --> 38:38.086
But as far as I'm concerned,

38:38.089 --> 38:40.673
it's just proves we're
doing the right thing.

38:40.676 --> 38:43.944
What was that old lady talkin' about?

38:43.946 --> 38:48.882
"Master Ridley, play th..." Somethin'.

38:48.884 --> 38:51.552
Well, back when people
still believed in gods,

38:51.554 --> 38:55.287
the Brits burned alive
two Eels at the stake,

38:55.289 --> 38:56.889
Ridley and Latimer,

38:56.891 --> 39:00.392
for praying to a different
book than their queen did.

39:00.394 --> 39:03.610
Before us, people committed
genocides over books,

39:03.613 --> 39:06.665
while others blew themselves
up killing innocent people.

39:06.668 --> 39:08.968
Insanity +100.

39:08.970 --> 39:11.700
But why did she burn herself for books?

39:11.703 --> 39:14.840
Well, she tired to burn
us all, don't you think?

39:14.842 --> 39:17.944
She didn't say "coward."

39:17.946 --> 39:21.313
She said "omnis." What is that?

39:21.315 --> 39:24.024
Well, the commissioner won't
say what the Ministry knows,

39:24.027 --> 39:27.429
but I guess we're
gonna have to find out.

39:36.429 --> 39:37.829
Burn me.

39:37.831 --> 39:39.330
- John.
- Go ahead.

39:41.001 --> 39:44.669
Hurry up. I won't ask twice.

39:51.244 --> 39:54.212
I know you're different
than the other men.

39:54.214 --> 39:57.115
I watched you grow up,

39:57.117 --> 40:00.652
and that's how I know you
feel the same inside as me.

40:02.788 --> 40:04.088
Closer.

40:07.793 --> 40:09.793
I've been burned so many times

40:09.795 --> 40:13.598
I don't know where my scars
end and my body begins.

40:25.811 --> 40:28.378
There's no way you're gonna break.

40:28.380 --> 40:33.517
You're the youngest cadet I ever
accepted into the Youth Fire Brigade.

40:34.753 --> 40:37.354
I raised you.

40:37.356 --> 40:42.025
And one day you'll be just like me, son.

40:42.027 --> 40:44.891
You won't feel anything
when they burn you.

40:58.477 --> 41:00.484
Yuxie, go dark, please.

41:00.487 --> 41:03.313
I'm secure now, Montag.

41:20.165 --> 41:22.431
"I am a sick man.

41:25.436 --> 41:27.804
I am a wicked man.

41:29.402 --> 41:32.236
An unattractive man.

41:32.239 --> 41:34.739
I think my liver hurts."

41:44.588 --> 41:48.924
"I agree that 'two times two is four'

41:48.926 --> 41:51.633
is an excellent thing.

41:51.636 --> 41:56.130
But 'two times two is five'

41:56.133 --> 42:01.302
is something also a most
charming little thing."

42:01.304 --> 42:03.905
- False.
- Yuxie, I said go dark.

42:03.907 --> 42:06.674
We are dark. It's just me and you.

42:06.676 --> 42:10.219
But that is false. Two
times two can only be four.

42:11.648 --> 42:14.014
What are you doing, Montag?

42:17.554 --> 42:19.654
Are you feeling OK?

42:23.025 --> 42:25.059
Where are you going?

44:12.300 --> 44:14.907
I don't think that old
woman killed herself.

44:14.910 --> 44:16.943
I think they staged it.

44:16.946 --> 44:18.524
It's all fake.

44:18.527 --> 44:20.350
Didn't even bother to
sync her lips this time.

44:20.353 --> 44:21.539
You saw that shit, right?

44:21.541 --> 44:23.541
Yeah, they definitely murdered her.

44:23.543 --> 44:25.344
Why do you keep pounding away at it?

44:26.947 --> 44:29.181
Hey. Are you good?

44:29.183 --> 44:32.117
Clarisse, you know
what we're working on.

44:32.119 --> 44:33.919
We need someone with your connections.

44:33.921 --> 44:36.621
So you tell me when you're
ready to come back to us.

44:45.900 --> 44:47.866
- See you later.
- See ya.

45:20.633 --> 45:22.775
- What are you? What do you want?
- Hey!

45:22.778 --> 45:24.529
Did Beatty send you?

45:24.532 --> 45:26.703
- No, I just came to talk.
- What do you want?

45:28.408 --> 45:31.708
I want to know who that old woman was.

45:31.710 --> 45:33.176
I don't know.

45:33.178 --> 45:37.648
She lit herself on fire... For books.

45:37.650 --> 45:40.154
- Why?
- What do you care?

45:40.157 --> 45:42.858
Because I can still smell her burning.

45:42.861 --> 45:46.630
- You did that.
- And you told us exactly where to find her.

45:48.828 --> 45:52.563
She didn't say "coward."
She said "omnis."

45:52.565 --> 45:53.931
What is that?

45:56.034 --> 45:57.367
I don't know.

45:59.705 --> 46:02.105
I just want to show you something.

46:12.684 --> 46:15.252
I took it from her house.

46:15.255 --> 46:17.222
Is this a trap, pipeman?

46:17.225 --> 46:20.793
If anybody sees me with this...

46:20.796 --> 46:22.296
I'm dead.

46:47.484 --> 46:48.861
Hey, Clarisse.

46:51.488 --> 46:52.487
Yeah?

47:09.147 --> 47:10.547
She didn't see who you were.

47:10.550 --> 47:11.848
I shouldn't be here.

47:11.851 --> 47:13.107
Then leave.

47:34.431 --> 47:36.130
Please don't do that.

48:04.026 --> 48:06.594
Can you read that out loud?

48:06.596 --> 48:08.295
Please?

48:13.736 --> 48:17.054
"Even if man were
nothing but a piano key,

48:17.057 --> 48:21.574
even if this were proved to him
by natural science and mathematics,

48:21.576 --> 48:25.280
even then, he will invent
destruction and chaos.

48:25.283 --> 48:28.447
He will invent all kinds of
suffering out of ingratitude

48:28.449 --> 48:31.150
simply to convince
himself that he is a man

48:31.152 --> 48:33.086
and not a piano key.

48:35.991 --> 48:37.857
Hard to understand, right?

48:39.643 --> 48:41.635
The Ministry has been wiping away

48:41.638 --> 48:44.329
language in order to wipe away thought.

48:44.332 --> 48:46.966
There used to be 6,000
languages in the world.

48:46.968 --> 48:49.836
Today there are fewer than 60.

48:49.838 --> 48:52.763
Why do you think the
Ministry wants to create

48:52.766 --> 48:55.006
one universal language on the 9?

48:55.009 --> 48:58.010
For the connection and happiness of...

48:58.012 --> 49:00.179
all Natives.

49:00.181 --> 49:03.782
During the Second Civil
War, the old tech companies,

49:03.784 --> 49:06.285
they built systems to
predict our thoughts.

49:06.287 --> 49:09.821
Then they became the Ministry,
or the Ministry joined them.

49:09.823 --> 49:12.791
And they sold us what we wanted,

49:12.793 --> 49:14.860
self and happiness,

49:14.862 --> 49:16.674
which the 9 provides in spades

49:16.677 --> 49:20.365
and what we hired you
to defend... with fire.

49:20.368 --> 49:22.832
You're telling me people
wanted it this way.

49:22.835 --> 49:24.835
The Ministry didn't do this to us.

49:24.838 --> 49:26.872
We did it to ourselves.

49:26.874 --> 49:28.974
We demanded a world like this.

49:39.198 --> 49:41.153
Let me ask you somethin'.

49:43.957 --> 49:45.256
Benjamin Franklin...

49:45.258 --> 49:47.325
Did he start the first fire department?

49:47.327 --> 49:49.327
Yeah, but to put fires out,

49:49.329 --> 49:51.429
not to start them.

49:51.431 --> 49:55.333
- Beatty told me the opposite.
- I know exactly what Beatty told you.

49:55.335 --> 49:58.250
Maybe he believes that,
maybe he's lying to you.

49:58.253 --> 50:02.240
Maybe when Beatty was young, he
let his fire captain lie to him.

50:02.242 --> 50:06.177
Do you have trouble with
memory? Take a lot of drops?

50:06.179 --> 50:10.881
What about you? Can
you remember your past?

50:10.883 --> 50:12.116
Some.

50:12.118 --> 50:15.119
Are you hungry? I don't have much.

50:18.358 --> 50:19.824
How 'bout your parents?

50:19.826 --> 50:22.193
Can you remember them?

50:24.297 --> 50:29.166
I was raised by Eels to be an
Eel, pretending to be a Native.

50:29.168 --> 50:32.436
We read books, watched films...

50:32.438 --> 50:34.338
everything you burn.

50:34.340 --> 50:38.575
By the time I was a teen, I
wanted to be normal, like you.

50:38.577 --> 50:41.212
So I ran away from home,

50:41.214 --> 50:46.516
got hooked on the 9,
the drops... everything.

50:46.518 --> 50:49.153
I was happy for a while.

50:49.155 --> 50:52.156
Then, you know, life.

50:52.158 --> 50:54.125
Men.

50:54.127 --> 50:57.995
I was broke, so I
started selling graffiti.

51:02.533 --> 51:05.212
Didn't know that old
woman would be there.

51:07.939 --> 51:11.741
I had never thought about the
people behind the things that I burn.

51:13.945 --> 51:18.281
I mean, they must have spent
their entire life making things.

51:18.283 --> 51:20.728
And here I come,

51:20.731 --> 51:23.665
in two seconds... it's gone.

51:33.665 --> 51:35.898
I want to show you something.

52:16.969 --> 52:18.169
Try it.

52:19.575 --> 52:21.108
Come on.

52:37.526 --> 52:39.126
Like this?

52:47.302 --> 52:49.769
Here.

52:50.839 --> 52:53.840
Put this one here on top.

52:53.842 --> 52:57.744
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Try it.

53:50.854 --> 53:54.089
All the details surrounding
the Omnis are classified,

53:54.092 --> 53:56.979
but the Ministry will include
the public to help smoke it out.

53:56.982 --> 53:58.436
The danger is real and immediate.

53:58.438 --> 54:01.139
Washington's watching us, boys.

54:01.141 --> 54:02.907
I want your cities to burn so hot

54:02.909 --> 54:05.143
the commander in chief
can roast marshmallows

54:05.145 --> 54:07.545
all the way from the White House.

54:07.547 --> 54:09.943
Make it rain kerosene.

55:03.768 --> 55:06.803
DNA.

55:06.805 --> 55:08.204
The genetic information

55:08.206 --> 55:10.640
found inside all living organisms.

55:10.642 --> 55:15.011
The Eels have converted
the language of technology

55:15.013 --> 55:17.279
into the the language of DNA.

55:17.281 --> 55:20.216
They've figured out a way
to insert enough graffiti

55:20.218 --> 55:23.520
into this microscopic speck of DNA

55:23.522 --> 55:26.422
to bury the earth ten times over.

55:26.424 --> 55:30.760
The Omnis is the collective
consciousness of mankind.

55:30.762 --> 55:35.063
It will be every book,
painting, music, film,

55:35.065 --> 55:36.665
all of history,

55:36.667 --> 55:38.934
everything on the
savages' Internet of old...

55:38.936 --> 55:42.370
News, memoirs, facts...

55:42.372 --> 55:47.843
It will be a trillion
person-years of graffiti...

55:47.845 --> 55:52.180
all inside this
microscopic strand of DNA.

55:52.182 --> 55:55.017
Now, the Ministry believes
it is here in Ohio,

55:55.019 --> 55:57.619
and in transit to scientists in Canada.

55:57.621 --> 56:00.388
We have to find it before
it crosses the border.

56:00.390 --> 56:03.091
Captain, if they succeed...

56:03.093 --> 56:04.826
how will we stop it?

56:07.030 --> 56:10.497
If the Omnis is unleashed,
there will be no way to stop it.

56:11.968 --> 56:15.369
All of humanity's chaotic
knowledge will burst forth

56:15.371 --> 56:19.440
like mosquitoes spreading malaria...

56:19.442 --> 56:22.877
and the dark countries will take over.

56:24.947 --> 56:28.481
Even the greatest army of Firemen

56:28.484 --> 56:33.087
will seem like spitting
babies before the Omnis.

56:33.089 --> 56:36.290
And everything our
parents, our grandparents,

56:36.292 --> 56:40.661
sacrificed in the Second
Civil War will be lost.

56:40.663 --> 56:44.398
We will not let that happen.

56:46.835 --> 56:49.970
We will burn down the
city tonight, gentlemen!

56:49.972 --> 56:51.738
- Salamander!
- Ho!

56:51.803 --> 56:54.040
- Salamander!
- Ho!

57:01.984 --> 57:05.285
Eels on the move! Eels on the move!

57:05.287 --> 57:06.686
This is why we burn!

57:17.632 --> 57:20.029
If any of you know where the Omnis is

57:20.032 --> 57:23.021
and don't talk, your
lives will be burned!

57:24.660 --> 57:26.393
Breaking news.

57:26.396 --> 57:29.008
There is a new threat to
our nation's happiness...

57:29.010 --> 57:30.201
The Omnis.

57:30.204 --> 57:32.011
The Ministry has not revealed details,

57:32.013 --> 57:33.979
but fire divisions across Pennsylvania,

57:33.981 --> 57:35.104
Indiana, and Ohio,

57:35.107 --> 57:36.159
are conducting raids,

57:36.162 --> 57:38.017
searching for this new evil.

57:38.019 --> 57:39.952
Get him! Get him!

57:39.954 --> 57:42.621
Omnis! What's that mean to you?
Huh? What's that mean to you?!

57:42.623 --> 57:44.489
You're not doing yourselves any favors.

57:44.491 --> 57:46.358
Tell me where the Omnis is!

57:46.360 --> 57:49.061
Death to fire! Real liberty unite!

57:49.063 --> 57:50.829
Come here!

57:50.831 --> 57:53.549
Slippery little Eel. In the truck!

57:53.552 --> 57:57.469
They try to say there's
no evidence danger exists.

57:57.471 --> 58:00.229
Well, then show me the
evidence danger doesn't exist.

58:00.232 --> 58:02.541
The truth is, this danger is real,

58:02.543 --> 58:03.809
the threat is real.

58:03.811 --> 58:05.410
Omnis is real.

58:05.412 --> 58:07.312
Death to fire!

58:13.720 --> 58:15.541
"To be sure, I myself

58:15.544 --> 58:17.838
just made up all these words of yours,

58:17.841 --> 58:20.024
this, too, is from underground.

58:20.026 --> 58:22.216
I've spent forty years on end there

58:22.219 --> 58:24.996
listening to these words
of yours through a crack.

58:24.998 --> 58:26.497
I thought them up myself

58:26.499 --> 58:29.133
since this was all that
would get thought up."

58:31.971 --> 58:33.404
I will have you

58:33.406 --> 58:35.971
down on this street
before the night is over!

58:35.974 --> 58:38.955
Consequences of silence will be severe!

58:38.958 --> 58:40.971
Help yourselves and your neighbors

58:40.974 --> 58:42.646
by telling us what you know!

58:42.648 --> 58:46.576
Not tomorrow, not the next day, but now!

58:49.020 --> 58:52.555
"At least I myself have
only recently resolved

58:52.558 --> 58:54.991
to recall some of my former adventures,

58:54.993 --> 58:58.128
which, till now, I have always avoided.

58:58.130 --> 59:00.646
Can it be that you
are indeed so gullible

59:00.649 --> 59:02.927
to imagine I will publish this all?

59:02.930 --> 59:05.168
And, what's more, give
it to you to read?"

59:26.825 --> 59:30.593
"Now I want precisely to make a test.

59:30.595 --> 59:32.495
Is it possible to... to per...

59:32.497 --> 59:36.032
Is it possible to be
perfectly candid with oneself

59:36.034 --> 59:40.703
and not be afraid...
of the whole truth?"

01:00:14.682 --> 01:00:17.884
One of you Eels must know
something about the Omnis.

01:00:25.633 --> 01:00:29.134
What if I tell these people what you do?

01:00:34.358 --> 01:00:37.258
What would be worse...

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:40.729
what I do to you, or
what they do to you?

01:00:42.533 --> 01:00:44.966
We're all the same here.

01:00:44.969 --> 01:00:47.825
Whatever you do to her, you do to us.

01:00:49.163 --> 01:00:50.729
Is that so?

01:00:50.732 --> 01:00:52.741
Fair enough.

01:00:54.211 --> 01:00:56.077
Ohh!

01:00:56.079 --> 01:00:59.748
I am your judge, and I am your court.

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.516
I receive you when you come,

01:01:02.518 --> 01:01:04.138
- and I...
- Ohh!

01:01:04.141 --> 01:01:06.308
Dismiss you when you go!

01:01:10.426 --> 01:01:12.799
- Round 'em up!
- Get over here.

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:15.987
Round 'em up. Over there!

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:18.499
Round 'em up.

01:01:20.603 --> 01:01:22.470
Come on. Come here.

01:01:31.748 --> 01:01:33.948
The Ministry has placed the nation

01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:37.955
in a +100 state of security
until the Omnis is found.

01:01:37.958 --> 01:01:40.489
Youth Cadets have been
recruited to patrol borders

01:01:40.492 --> 01:01:42.174
and search all transit hubs.

01:01:42.177 --> 01:01:43.957
Do your duty. Stay vivid on the 9

01:01:43.959 --> 01:01:47.261
and report all suspicious activity.

01:01:47.263 --> 01:01:50.730
- What are you doing?
- I have to get out of here.

01:01:50.732 --> 01:01:52.766
Where you gonna go?

01:01:52.768 --> 01:01:54.667
There are people
hiding out at a compound

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:56.036
my family used to know.

01:01:56.038 --> 01:01:57.696
Maybe I can help them.

01:01:57.699 --> 01:01:59.666
They got checkpoints all over the place.

01:01:59.669 --> 01:02:01.275
You think you can make it?

01:02:01.277 --> 01:02:03.977
I have a friend who
knows where they are.

01:02:03.979 --> 01:02:06.346
I think he can help me.

01:02:08.483 --> 01:02:10.308
Will I see you again?

01:02:37.312 --> 01:02:39.578
We're searching for that Omnis!

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:45.183
- Get 'em out of here!
- Yes, sir.

01:02:58.465 --> 01:03:00.531
All clear. Let's check upstairs.

01:03:02.402 --> 01:03:04.869
Shh!

01:04:04.027 --> 01:04:07.731
And how would you explain
your behavior today?

01:04:07.733 --> 01:04:09.566
I fucked up.

01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:14.804
- I couldn't tell you why.
- Was it the kid?

01:04:14.806 --> 01:04:18.374
Eels use kids as decoys all the time.

01:04:18.376 --> 01:04:22.512
No excuse. I know my actions
put you and the men in danger.

01:04:22.514 --> 01:04:24.613
What if they had had the Omnis?

01:04:30.558 --> 01:04:33.792
Captain Beatty...

01:04:33.795 --> 01:04:36.596
sir, it's been a true honor.

01:04:36.599 --> 01:04:38.760
But...

01:04:38.763 --> 01:04:42.456
I respectfully ask that
you accept my resignation.

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:48.603
Get that off my desk.

01:04:48.606 --> 01:04:49.705
I'm sorry, John.

01:04:49.707 --> 01:04:51.019
Do it. Now.

01:04:59.015 --> 01:05:01.248
Are you serious?

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:05.687
I just submitted your name
to replace me as captain.

01:05:05.689 --> 01:05:07.633
- It's not about that.
- Oh.

01:05:07.636 --> 01:05:09.791
So you're willing to throw away

01:05:09.793 --> 01:05:12.852
the sixteen years that
I've invested in you.

01:05:12.855 --> 01:05:15.597
I have sixteen years

01:05:15.599 --> 01:05:18.866
of the Ministry's shit in my head.

01:05:18.868 --> 01:05:20.914
And I want to know why we burn.

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:23.270
- I want to decide.
- Ah.

01:05:23.272 --> 01:05:25.985
- So you want to prove you exist.
- Yeah, I do.

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:28.745
I got things inside my
head that don't make sense.

01:05:28.748 --> 01:05:30.472
Dreams about my dad.

01:05:30.475 --> 01:05:33.240
Look, as your commanding officer,

01:05:33.243 --> 01:05:35.916
it is my duty to report you

01:05:35.918 --> 01:05:38.218
for letting two Eels go free today.

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:41.672
And if I do that, you
will be tried for treason.

01:05:41.675 --> 01:05:44.725
And there will be nothing
I can do to protect you.

01:05:44.727 --> 01:05:48.495
You betray me...

01:05:48.497 --> 01:05:50.430
and I will burn you.

01:05:50.432 --> 01:05:53.867
And then I will burn your ashes.

01:05:55.638 --> 01:05:59.740
Dreams are a terror, son. I know.

01:05:59.742 --> 01:06:03.710
But it's just your mind
flingin' itself to pieces.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.213
Just stand back from the centrifuge, OK?

01:06:08.215 --> 01:06:10.159
You have a virus.

01:06:10.162 --> 01:06:11.448
Go home...

01:06:11.451 --> 01:06:12.972
and rest.

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:15.837
Take a hot bath.

01:06:18.793 --> 01:06:21.193
And then you report to work tomorrow.

01:06:21.195 --> 01:06:23.095
But don't make me come get you.

01:06:43.616 --> 01:06:45.249
Reactivate.

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:46.751
Hello, John.

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:50.088
Yuxie, get me Fireman Douglas.

01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:57.696
Do your part. See
something, say something.

01:06:57.698 --> 01:07:00.574
Tell Yuxie. Together,
we will keep Cleveland...

01:07:14.225 --> 01:07:16.592
Montag. Get in.

01:07:26.158 --> 01:07:27.958
- How'd you find me?
- My friend Gustav...

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.727
I'm no friend of his.

01:07:29.729 --> 01:07:31.292
Don't look at me.

01:07:31.295 --> 01:07:33.929
- Don't fuckin' look at me!
- What's wrong with you?!

01:07:33.932 --> 01:07:35.821
You deleted my brother's life, man!

01:07:35.824 --> 01:07:39.203
And you gave him 25 years! You're scum!

01:07:39.205 --> 01:07:40.503
That's enough.

01:07:47.379 --> 01:07:49.546
You better be right about him.

01:07:49.548 --> 01:07:50.894
Where we goin'?

01:07:50.897 --> 01:07:53.016
To those people at the
compound I told you about.

01:07:53.019 --> 01:07:55.017
- They want to see you.
- For what?

01:07:55.019 --> 01:07:58.688
- Something about the Omnis.
- Do it, or I will.

01:08:03.803 --> 01:08:05.102
You have to put this on.

01:08:29.965 --> 01:08:31.997
Who else was with 'em?

01:08:32.001 --> 01:08:34.734
I don't know, sir.
Axix-Cam picked up Clarisse.

01:08:34.738 --> 01:08:37.158
I knew Montag was a rat.
I told you he wasn't pure.

01:08:37.162 --> 01:08:38.721
I didn't ask your opinion!

01:08:38.725 --> 01:08:41.171
And the next time I tell
you to follow someone,

01:08:41.175 --> 01:08:43.299
you crawl into their asshole!

01:08:43.301 --> 01:08:44.832
You hear me?!

01:08:46.036 --> 01:08:48.404
Report back to the station.

01:08:48.406 --> 01:08:49.738
Yes, sir.

01:08:52.643 --> 01:08:55.176
This is a problem, John.

01:09:17.099 --> 01:09:20.368
Clarisse told us you stole this.

01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:22.050
But when I see you sitting there,

01:09:22.053 --> 01:09:24.537
all I can see is fire.

01:09:24.541 --> 01:09:29.133
You must be burning all these
books, and us, in your mind.

01:09:29.136 --> 01:09:31.019
Because you are what you are,

01:09:31.022 --> 01:09:33.479
and perhaps, that's
all you'll ever be...

01:09:33.482 --> 01:09:34.781
Fire.

01:09:34.783 --> 01:09:37.149
This man is just like
his Commandant Beatty.

01:09:37.152 --> 01:09:38.952
He's not to be trusted.

01:09:38.953 --> 01:09:41.854
Why did you burn books your whole life?

01:09:41.857 --> 01:09:43.923
Because that's all I know.

01:09:43.925 --> 01:09:46.493
Deze man is een stuk stront.

01:09:46.495 --> 01:09:49.194
But I want to do something else.

01:09:49.197 --> 01:09:51.096
Why?

01:09:58.079 --> 01:09:59.779
When I look at that book,

01:09:59.782 --> 01:10:01.982
it made me remember when I was a kid.

01:10:04.246 --> 01:10:08.046
Just sittin' by the ocean...

01:10:08.048 --> 01:10:12.818
and I was trying to fill
this sieve with sand.

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:16.989
But the faster I poured, the
faster the sand fell through it.

01:10:19.427 --> 01:10:21.260
Lookin' at the words in that book,

01:10:21.262 --> 01:10:24.830
I felt like they... they
were passing right through me.

01:10:27.702 --> 01:10:31.770
Like my whole life just...

01:10:31.772 --> 01:10:34.139
passed right through me.

01:10:34.141 --> 01:10:37.042
And that I missed it.

01:10:39.446 --> 01:10:42.347
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

01:10:46.753 --> 01:10:49.121
Books are here to remind us

01:10:49.123 --> 01:10:51.323
what fools we can be.

01:10:51.325 --> 01:10:54.861
But if we can remember,
if the Omnis can spread,

01:10:54.864 --> 01:10:57.963
then maybe we will win.

01:10:57.965 --> 01:11:00.065
The disconnected human mind

01:11:00.067 --> 01:11:04.335
is the last bastion against
the technological world.

01:11:04.337 --> 01:11:08.940
It's the most secure place
to preserve these books.

01:11:08.942 --> 01:11:10.739
We're totally off the grid.

01:11:10.742 --> 01:11:14.844
No computers, no way for
you to Firemen to track us

01:11:14.847 --> 01:11:17.381
or enter our dreams.

01:11:17.383 --> 01:11:20.254
Everything safely here.

01:11:20.257 --> 01:11:23.386
- You memorized all these books?
- We each memorize one,

01:11:23.389 --> 01:11:25.489
and then we become the book.

01:11:25.491 --> 01:11:29.626
I am Toni Morrison. "Song of Solomon."

01:11:29.628 --> 01:11:31.862
He's "The Letters of Van Gogh."

01:11:31.864 --> 01:11:35.507
She's Chairman Mao,
"The Little Red Book."

01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:39.358
She's Rumi, Darwin, "Anna Karenina."

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:42.305
And she's half of "A Yellow Sun."

01:11:42.307 --> 01:11:44.674
She's still memorizing it.

01:11:44.676 --> 01:11:47.944
In fact, you've met one of us already.

01:11:50.415 --> 01:11:52.748
You took this book from her library.

01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:56.486
She was John Steinbeck's
"The Grapes of Wrath"...

01:11:56.488 --> 01:12:00.190
Now lost to humanity forever.

01:12:00.192 --> 01:12:03.559
But maybe from her death
we will gain something.

01:12:03.561 --> 01:12:06.196
We haven't seen Clarisse
since she was a teen

01:12:06.198 --> 01:12:09.366
when she was here with her parents.

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:13.870
I believe you were
memorizing "White Teeth."

01:12:15.406 --> 01:12:18.040
And she tells us you want to help.

01:12:18.042 --> 01:12:22.283
We have an important task
for you related to the Omnis.

01:12:22.286 --> 01:12:24.914
But we have to be sure about you.

01:12:25.983 --> 01:12:28.383
Do you know this man?

01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:31.300
Fireman Hester. Fourth District.

01:12:31.303 --> 01:12:34.704
That's right. He's in the
back room, waiting for you.

01:12:34.707 --> 01:12:37.575
And you're gonna have to kill him.

01:12:37.578 --> 01:12:39.912
You never told me that.

01:13:04.555 --> 01:13:06.287
He's through that door.

01:13:07.824 --> 01:13:11.459
A revolution is not a dinner party.

01:13:11.461 --> 01:13:13.094
Good luck.

01:13:29.078 --> 01:13:31.211
I need you, I need you.

01:14:07.015 --> 01:14:08.715
Stop! Put it down!

01:14:08.717 --> 01:14:10.036
Hey, man, what the fuck is this?

01:14:10.039 --> 01:14:13.474
You did it. It's over.

01:14:13.477 --> 01:14:16.155
I'm James Baldwin.

01:14:16.157 --> 01:14:18.758
"The Fire Next Time." Welcome.

01:15:06.255 --> 01:15:08.022
This way, please.

01:15:10.609 --> 01:15:12.443
There's a young man, Clifford,

01:15:12.446 --> 01:15:14.310
in this barn, in transit to

01:15:14.313 --> 01:15:16.513
a group of scientists in Canada,

01:15:16.516 --> 01:15:18.383
and we need you to escort him

01:15:18.385 --> 01:15:19.677
over the border.

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:22.604
His mother was a
geneticist behind the Omnis.

01:15:22.607 --> 01:15:25.838
Before she died, she injected the DNA

01:15:25.841 --> 01:15:28.058
into Clifford's pet bird.

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:30.627
- The Omnis is in a bird?
- Yes.

01:15:30.629 --> 01:15:33.372
We need you to get them both to safety.

01:15:38.685 --> 01:15:41.471
Clifford? There's a man here to see you.

01:15:41.473 --> 01:15:44.308
Eight. Tagore, Gitanjali,

01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:45.676
and poems by Tagore.

01:15:45.678 --> 01:15:47.311
It's number eight.

01:15:47.313 --> 01:15:49.580
Has he read all these books?

01:15:49.582 --> 01:15:51.981
He's memorized over 13,000 books.

01:15:51.983 --> 01:15:53.654
Pick up a book and test me.

01:15:53.657 --> 01:15:55.991
I won't look. But you'll never win.

01:16:04.329 --> 01:16:07.363
Read the title.

01:16:09.234 --> 01:16:11.834
- "Remembrance of Things..."
- Remembrance of Things Past."

01:16:11.836 --> 01:16:14.660
Marcel Proust, 1927.

01:16:14.663 --> 01:16:18.027
3,031 pages, seven volumes,

01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:21.577
1,267,069 words.

01:16:21.579 --> 01:16:22.945
Open it.

01:16:24.449 --> 01:16:25.981
Open it.

01:16:31.366 --> 01:16:33.165
Page number... I'll turn around.

01:16:33.168 --> 01:16:34.934
No cheating. Page number?

01:16:34.937 --> 01:16:38.526
- Page 935.
- 935.

01:16:38.528 --> 01:16:40.462
Line 12. Go to line 12.

01:16:40.464 --> 01:16:43.543
"So, as long as you distract
your mind from its dreams,

01:16:43.546 --> 01:16:45.777
it will not know them for what they are.

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:48.836
You will always be taken in
by the appearance of things,

01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:51.898
because you will not have
grasped their true nature.

01:16:51.901 --> 01:16:53.965
If dreaming is dangerous,

01:16:53.968 --> 01:16:56.598
then the cure for it
is not to dream less,

01:16:56.601 --> 01:17:00.248
but to dream more, to
dream all the time."

01:17:01.618 --> 01:17:03.585
Again, test... Test me again.

01:17:03.587 --> 01:17:04.852
You'll lose.

01:17:13.728 --> 01:17:15.465
Oh, can I show him Lennie?

01:17:15.468 --> 01:17:17.598
- Can I?
- Yes.

01:17:28.643 --> 01:17:31.344
Hey. This is Lennie.

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:35.449
My sturnidae, from the Latin sturnus.

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:38.840
Medium-sized passerine.
Very gregarious.

01:17:38.843 --> 01:17:41.388
Very beautiful.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:43.624
This is my Lennie.

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:50.730
What's up, Lennie?

01:17:53.082 --> 01:17:54.981
So, what's the next step?

01:17:54.984 --> 01:17:56.736
We need a transponder.

01:17:56.738 --> 01:17:58.538
The scientists in Canada

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.373
are transmitting a homing signal

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:02.316
that will call to a transponder.

01:18:02.319 --> 01:18:04.366
Can you get one and come back tonight?

01:18:04.369 --> 01:18:06.213
Yes.

01:18:06.215 --> 01:18:07.714
What are they gonna do with the bird?

01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:10.734
They're waiting to extract
the DNA with the Omnis,

01:18:10.737 --> 01:18:11.921
duplicate it,

01:18:11.924 --> 01:18:14.801
and then inject all other animals

01:18:14.804 --> 01:18:19.025
so that knowledge can
spread and multiply.

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:20.727
And cover the world.

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:22.528
You'd better hurry.

01:19:47.514 --> 01:19:49.748
Master Trooper.

01:19:55.422 --> 01:19:57.456
I wasn't expecting to see you.

01:19:57.458 --> 01:20:00.124
- Are you over your sickness?
- Yeah.

01:20:00.126 --> 01:20:02.113
You were right. I just needed to rest.

01:20:02.116 --> 01:20:04.395
- I'm feelin' 100 now.
- Beautiful.

01:20:04.397 --> 01:20:06.664
- So you're with us.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:06.666 --> 01:20:09.660
We need to find the Omnis. Any leads?

01:20:09.663 --> 01:20:14.439
Yuxie, have Fireman Douglas
and his squad report.

01:20:14.441 --> 01:20:16.474
Ready time. I'm ready to gear up.

01:20:21.348 --> 01:20:23.647
What does two times two equal?

01:20:24.784 --> 01:20:26.250
Excuse me?

01:20:27.954 --> 01:20:29.687
Four.

01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:31.722
Why? What's wrong?

01:20:35.027 --> 01:20:37.227
Is that all you have to say to me?

01:20:37.229 --> 01:20:39.497
Of course.

01:20:39.499 --> 01:20:42.232
John, just talk to me. What's goin' on?

01:20:42.234 --> 01:20:45.936
I, too, burn with desire.

01:20:47.271 --> 01:20:52.008
But I would rather walk with
my brother in the darkness

01:20:52.011 --> 01:20:54.597
than go alone in the light.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.464
- Sir.
- Whatever happens tonight, Guy,

01:20:57.467 --> 01:21:01.485
you should know I would
rather walk with my brother.

01:21:06.958 --> 01:21:08.858
Douglas, report, please.

01:21:10.090 --> 01:21:11.723
Found this in the locker room, sir.

01:21:11.726 --> 01:21:13.433
Whose locker did you find it in?

01:21:13.436 --> 01:21:14.967
Nobody's. It was just on the floor.

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:17.066
Like a dead rat.

01:21:17.068 --> 01:21:18.568
Take it!

01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:20.202
That's an order.

01:21:21.972 --> 01:21:25.170
Go on. Read us a bedtime story.

01:21:25.173 --> 01:21:26.910
Let's burn this shit.

01:21:26.912 --> 01:21:28.144
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:21:28.146 --> 01:21:30.902
A special tip came
directly to me tonight.

01:21:30.905 --> 01:21:33.449
Might be a good lead on the Omnis.

01:21:33.451 --> 01:21:36.552
But let's finish this
little business first.

01:21:36.554 --> 01:21:38.286
Open the book.

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:42.490
Oh, my. Your pulse is really racing.

01:21:42.492 --> 01:21:45.794
Steady now, Montag. I wouldn't
want to burn your hand off.

01:21:45.796 --> 01:21:48.830
Now read. Read to me.

01:21:50.767 --> 01:21:54.835
"To go wrong in one's own way

01:21:54.838 --> 01:21:58.139
is better than to go
right in someone else's.

01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:04.646
Taking a new step,
uttering a new word...

01:22:07.618 --> 01:22:10.351
is what people fear the most."

01:22:10.353 --> 01:22:12.944
All those silly words,

01:22:12.947 --> 01:22:16.949
those false promises,
the timeworn philosophies.

01:22:16.952 --> 01:22:21.529
It's like chain-smoking,
chapter by chapter.

01:22:21.531 --> 01:22:25.133
- Go on. Don't stop reading to me.
- Sir.

01:22:25.135 --> 01:22:26.834
Next page!

01:22:30.907 --> 01:22:33.174
"Did you think that one tiny crime...

01:22:35.078 --> 01:22:39.247
would be wiped out by
thousands of good deeds?

01:22:39.249 --> 01:22:42.016
That there would be no punishment?"

01:22:48.124 --> 01:22:50.290
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

01:22:50.292 --> 01:22:53.127
You read a few lines, and you're
ready to blow up the world,

01:22:53.129 --> 01:22:55.762
chop heads off, destroy authority.

01:22:55.764 --> 01:22:59.299
I know. I've been through it all.

01:23:01.774 --> 01:23:04.138
Now, what do you want to do?

01:23:09.278 --> 01:23:10.938
I want to burn.

01:23:10.941 --> 01:23:12.274
Hmm.

01:23:13.915 --> 01:23:16.650
Montag.

01:23:16.652 --> 01:23:18.064
My brother.

01:23:18.067 --> 01:23:19.600
Let's burn.

01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:54.633
Good evening, Cleveland.

01:23:54.636 --> 01:23:57.022
Live outside Master
Trooper Montag's home

01:23:57.024 --> 01:23:59.313
where shocking events are unfolding.

01:24:00.928 --> 01:24:03.929
Montag! Do you have
anything to say to your fans?

01:24:05.566 --> 01:24:06.932
Montag.

01:24:06.935 --> 01:24:09.601
Something the matter, Montag?

01:24:13.547 --> 01:24:16.641
You wanted to fly near the sun.

01:24:16.643 --> 01:24:19.377
You burn your damn wings
off and you wonder why.

01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:24.983
Go in. I'll give you a minute
to get your house in order.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:28.186
Go on.

01:24:34.794 --> 01:24:37.962
No one is lookin' out for you now, boy.

01:24:57.283 --> 01:25:02.452
Hello, Montag. This
is rather unfortunate.

01:25:02.454 --> 01:25:04.487
Some people would like to see you.

01:25:12.362 --> 01:25:15.530
That's quite a collection
of graffiti you have there.

01:25:15.533 --> 01:25:18.168
Your fans deserve an explanation.

01:25:18.170 --> 01:25:20.837
These aren't mine. You set me up!

01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:27.811
Welcome, John. I've
been waiting for you.

01:25:27.813 --> 01:25:29.445
Yuxie, go dark.

01:25:32.517 --> 01:25:36.618
I told you I would burn
you if you betrayed me.

01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:39.188
And this...

01:25:39.190 --> 01:25:41.556
this is the big dance.

01:25:43.854 --> 01:25:45.487
Douglas. Stone.

01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:49.225
Yuxie! Let the fire show begin.

01:25:50.610 --> 01:25:54.812
Now, you do what you are trained to do.

01:25:54.815 --> 01:25:57.116
All you know how to do.

01:25:57.119 --> 01:25:58.651
Burn.

01:26:48.204 --> 01:26:51.038
You're not finished. Go on.

01:27:15.869 --> 01:27:17.950
Free yourself.

01:27:49.612 --> 01:27:51.880
Let's light him up.

01:27:51.883 --> 01:27:54.520
Tell your fans what time it is.

01:27:54.522 --> 01:27:57.075
It's time to burn for America again!

01:27:57.078 --> 01:27:58.857
Say it, Montag.

01:27:58.859 --> 01:28:00.526
Say it!

01:28:00.528 --> 01:28:02.193
Spit it out! Come on!

01:28:07.167 --> 01:28:08.434
Come on, Captain.

01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:15.270
Why did you do this?

01:28:15.273 --> 01:28:18.776
What did you find? Chaos.

01:28:26.143 --> 01:28:28.944
The Salamander eats its own tail.

01:28:31.558 --> 01:28:34.258
Master Trooper Douglas.

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:36.456
Master Trooper Douglas reporting, sir.

01:28:36.459 --> 01:28:39.426
- Tell us what you saw.
- Montag getting into a car

01:28:39.429 --> 01:28:41.841
with Clarisse McClellan
and two known Eels.

01:28:41.844 --> 01:28:43.968
No wonder you've been
so eloquent lately.

01:28:43.970 --> 01:28:47.004
But you're still the same dog I raised,

01:28:47.006 --> 01:28:50.908
just barking at someone else's command.

01:28:50.910 --> 01:28:53.515
Gather a squad, find
Clarisse and the other Eels

01:28:53.518 --> 01:28:55.317
- and bring them to me.
- Yes, sir.

01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:02.247
- Montag! Stop! Let it go! Drop it!
- Drop it, Douglas!

01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:04.888
Well, that's one way
to win your fans back.

01:29:04.890 --> 01:29:07.294
Hold fire till your brother speaks.

01:29:07.297 --> 01:29:09.126
- Drop it, Douglas.
- Go ahead,

01:29:09.128 --> 01:29:11.020
pull the trigger, let Douglas have it.

01:29:11.023 --> 01:29:12.734
- Captain.
- Quiet, Douglas!

01:29:12.737 --> 01:29:14.964
Could it be existence is our exile

01:29:14.967 --> 01:29:16.833
and nothingness is our home?

01:29:16.835 --> 01:29:18.856
Fire is your home, Montag.

01:29:18.859 --> 01:29:20.794
- Burn away.
- No, Captain, please!

01:29:20.797 --> 01:29:23.598
What is called a reason
for living is also

01:29:23.601 --> 01:29:26.076
an excellent reason for dying.

01:29:55.806 --> 01:29:58.707
Montag, you did it.

01:30:00.078 --> 01:30:01.644
You did it.

01:30:16.893 --> 01:30:18.626
Choice.

01:30:33.943 --> 01:30:35.676
Dear Natives.

01:30:35.678 --> 01:30:37.078
Eel Montag,

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.679
murderer Montag,

01:30:38.681 --> 01:30:39.937
terrorist Montag,

01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:43.708
has committed treason
against our nation.

01:30:43.711 --> 01:30:46.487
Eyes on Axis-Cam, eyes on the 9,

01:30:46.489 --> 01:30:48.403
and report where this terrorist is.

01:30:48.406 --> 01:30:51.459
Terrorist Montag...
Could he have the Omnis?

01:30:51.461 --> 01:30:53.527
Stay vivid to find out.

01:31:13.648 --> 01:31:16.816
- Where's Gustavo?
- They arrested him.

01:31:16.818 --> 01:31:18.918
Transponder?

01:31:24.625 --> 01:31:27.393
- Page 93.
- 93.

01:31:32.501 --> 01:31:36.169
"I bequeath myself to the dirt

01:31:36.171 --> 01:31:39.075
to grow from the grass I love.

01:31:39.078 --> 01:31:43.109
If you want me again, look
for me under your boot soles.

01:31:43.111 --> 01:31:47.212
You will hardly know
who I am or what I mean,

01:31:47.214 --> 01:31:50.249
but I shall be good
help to you nevertheless,

01:31:50.251 --> 01:31:53.753
and filter and fiber your blood.

01:31:53.755 --> 01:31:57.723
Failing to fetch me at
first, keep encouraged.

01:31:57.725 --> 01:32:01.493
Missing me one place, search another.

01:32:01.495 --> 01:32:05.564
I stop somewhere, waiting for you."

01:32:05.566 --> 01:32:08.333
Found him. He's heading
to this black hole

01:32:08.335 --> 01:32:09.934
outside Talay City.

01:32:09.937 --> 01:32:12.437
Rerouting for fastest arrival.

01:32:25.834 --> 01:32:29.169
Clifford, run!

01:32:29.172 --> 01:32:31.522
Clifford!

01:33:16.568 --> 01:33:18.768
Get out of here! Run! Run!

01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:20.278
- Toni!
- Don't you move!

01:33:20.281 --> 01:33:22.931
- Get down!
- Get off of her!

01:33:31.607 --> 01:33:35.711
Come on. Get up, we gotta go.

01:33:35.714 --> 01:33:37.013
Come on.

01:33:58.976 --> 01:34:02.047
Stand still!

01:34:05.992 --> 01:34:09.617
When I ask you not to
move, that means don't move!

01:34:35.745 --> 01:34:37.512
Hey. Clifford.

01:34:37.514 --> 01:34:39.250
Hey. Come on.

01:35:30.898 --> 01:35:32.630
Omnis?

01:35:37.573 --> 01:35:38.938
Stop.

01:35:41.142 --> 01:35:43.777
I command you, Montag.

01:35:43.779 --> 01:35:45.779
Stop.
