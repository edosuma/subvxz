WEBVTT

00:20.729 --> 00:23.023
[whispers] I'll be waiting for you, baby.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.842
[heart rate monitor beeping]

02:38.324 --> 02:39.325
[baby coughs]

02:40.326 --> 02:43.246
[baby gurgles softly]

02:49.711 --> 02:51.170
Meet your son.

03:00.930 --> 03:01.848
Uh...

03:05.727 --> 03:07.437
I'm sorry I wasn't here for you.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.150
I should've been here. I'm...

03:13.860 --> 03:14.861
You're here now.

03:20.325 --> 03:23.912
[both chuckling]

03:26.956 --> 03:30.543
-[soft rock music plays over speakers]
-[indistinct PA chatter]

03:31.044 --> 03:34.047
[man] I've seen that white girl
in the store a couple times.

03:34.130 --> 03:37.508
When I caught her,
she had hand sanitizing gel,

03:37.592 --> 03:39.093
wet-naps and whatnot in her backpack.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.429
Not one of the usual project bunnies
you get around here.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.514
A clean freak heroin junkie.
That's a first, huh?

03:43.598 --> 03:44.849
-Yeah, right.
-[chuckles]

03:44.933 --> 03:47.727
[man] Stood out too
because of that purple streak in her hair.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.233
Yep. Here's her file.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.655
[KJ] Nadine Elaine MacAllister.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.281
St. Mary's Girls Academy.

04:00.531 --> 04:03.660
That's in Short Hills.
It's quite a walk from the projects.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.204
I called the school, told them
we had one of their best and brightest.

04:06.537 --> 04:09.165
Not an hour later, her mother shows up
in a 6 Series Benz.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.167
This is a store incident report.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.337
You didn't call the police?
She wasn't arrested?

04:14.420 --> 04:16.214
Her mother paid for the stuff
and then some.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.341
From a good home.
Figured I'd give her a break.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.301
Of course you did.

04:20.843 --> 04:22.387
-Can we keep this?
-Sure.

04:25.056 --> 04:28.059
That Short Hills whatever fancy hoo-ha,
you seemed familiar.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.521
-I grew up the next town over.
-Okay. [laughing]

04:32.230 --> 04:34.565
Yes, there are well-off black people
in America.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.568
What would your well-off folks think
about your boyfriend from last night?

04:37.652 --> 04:40.822
Wanna get a Plan B while we're here?
I'm just saying. Just to be safe.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.365
We should take karaoke guy

04:42.448 --> 04:45.118
-and introduce him to Mr. and Mrs. KJ.
-[cell phone ringing]

04:45.201 --> 04:48.037
Don't you think? I'm sure they'd get
a kick out of him. Rinaldi.

04:50.039 --> 04:50.915
When?

04:52.917 --> 04:54.919
Yeah, all right. I got it. Thanks. Bye.

04:58.047 --> 04:58.923
What?

05:02.593 --> 05:04.262
Brenton Butler died last night.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.482
Uh, you should go to the Butlers',
give an update on Dorsey,

05:16.566 --> 05:19.110
let them know the job's still open.
I'll try to find this girl.

05:19.193 --> 05:21.321
Well, shouldn't you speak with the family?

05:23.031 --> 05:24.615
You're the detective, so...

05:25.158 --> 05:27.160
-You should--
-I got court in-- in...

05:29.287 --> 05:31.164
-In 15 minutes. So...
-So, talk to them after.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.791
-I'll give you a ride.
-I'll take the bus. It'll be faster.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.001
I've got other cases.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.069
Trice?

06:45.530 --> 06:47.532
They told me he'd come back to me.

06:56.332 --> 06:59.544
Whatever decision was gonna be made
wasn't up to no doctor.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.339
He's got us.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.300
The Lord.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.430
He's gonna keep us up through this.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.851
You find comfort in that?

07:28.114 --> 07:29.574
I'm gonna start making calls.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.585
-[slams window shut]
-I want it open.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.715
[slides window open]

08:22.084 --> 08:23.044
Mrs. MacAllister?

08:25.213 --> 08:28.132
-Hi. It is MacAllister, right?
-Can I help you?

08:28.216 --> 08:30.927
Yeah, Detective Rinaldi.
Jersey City Police Department.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.387
What do you want?

08:33.471 --> 08:35.598
I just want to have a word
with your daughter, Nadine.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.767
She's not here.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.603
Okay. Um, do you know when she'll be back?

08:42.188 --> 08:45.274
Yeah, yeah, you know, I mean,
it is fucking cold out here, um...

08:45.775 --> 08:48.653
Uh, yeah, I don't mind talking inside,
if that works best for you.

08:49.904 --> 08:50.905
Hm?

08:54.909 --> 08:57.203
-[rap music playing]
-[girls giggling]

08:57.578 --> 09:00.164
-No.
-Oh, my God.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.374
[indistinct chatter]

09:10.424 --> 09:12.593
[girls giggling]

09:17.974 --> 09:19.684
-[girl] Oh, my God.
-Come here.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.312
-Don't.
-Don't you dare.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.605
-No.
-Nadine, don't. Stop.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.523
Nadine, no.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.608
-[girl scoffs]
-[music stops]

09:31.946 --> 09:32.863
Is that for me?

09:33.906 --> 09:35.199
Depends on if you earn it.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.036
I'm totally bare down there.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.080
Like a little girl.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.334
You like little girls.
Yeah, you do. I can tell.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.213
[Fish] Looking to score some tar?

09:51.340 --> 09:52.383
Why, you holding?

09:52.466 --> 09:54.885
What do you know about
some Timberland boots taken off a kid

09:54.969 --> 09:56.262
in Liberty State Park?

09:57.054 --> 09:57.972
Huh?

09:59.807 --> 10:01.309
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.686
Don't know about boots
or anybody at Liberty State Park.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.855
-You got the wrong girl.
-I got the right girl.

10:07.064 --> 10:10.067
Maybe the wrong time,
but I got the right girl.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.239
[girls murmuring indistinctly]

10:15.323 --> 10:16.907
[Nadine] Come on. Let's go!

10:22.204 --> 10:23.414
[Marie giggles]

10:26.500 --> 10:29.503
-Be careful.
-No, I got him. Don't worry.

10:29.587 --> 10:30.921
-[baby grunts]
-Shh.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.965
[chuckles] He's so little.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.301
I hope we don't break him.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.011
No, we won't.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.890
It's okay. Shh...

10:41.307 --> 10:43.476
Little Michael. It's all right.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.269
[Pete chuckles]

10:45.936 --> 10:47.146
[Pete] Shh...

10:47.438 --> 10:49.273
[all shout] Surprise!

10:51.400 --> 10:52.860
[baby crying]

10:56.656 --> 10:59.158
[Marie]
Oh, my God, no. Felix, take this, please.

10:59.784 --> 11:00.910
Right now.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.078
[baby crying]

11:03.954 --> 11:06.082
-This one here. I love this.
-Yeah? Do you like it?

11:06.165 --> 11:06.999
It's so cute.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.085
-["Pop! Goes the Weasel" plays]
-Oh!

11:09.168 --> 11:10.544
[laughing]

11:10.628 --> 11:13.130
-[R&B music plays softly]
-This is from your boys.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.132
Osorio and Manny.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.717
It's all you.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.431
-[woman] Just a couple of things.
-Buy him something nice.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.017
[woman] Are you kidding me?
Whatever you need. Just let me know.

11:26.894 --> 11:30.272
-[Marie] Oh, my gosh! That's adorable.
-That is really cute.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.316
-It's good. Yeah. We had it made special.
-Petey.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.776
-It's so cute, right?
-[laughing]

11:33.859 --> 11:35.319
Well, listen up. Guys! Guys!

11:35.736 --> 11:37.321
Listen up! Gather around!

11:40.074 --> 11:44.328
So, we all know that Pete's been on loan
to my unit for the last month.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.123
And I got to say...

11:48.582 --> 11:50.960
it crossed my mind more
than a few times to kick his ass out.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.504
Di. Language. There's a baby here.
Come on.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.590
[chuckles]
All right, Crys, I'll keep it clean.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.430
So, here's the deal.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.518
He's proven himself to be
one hell of a cop.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.438
One of us.

12:12.273 --> 12:16.777
I want to welcome you, officially,
to South District's Narcotics Unit.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.405
-[woman] Yeah!
-[applause]

12:19.864 --> 12:20.698
[DiAngelo] Huh?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.743
[DiAngelo] You good? You good?

12:26.662 --> 12:28.497
[rock music plays over speakers]

12:32.293 --> 12:35.755
Your official transfer orders will take
at least a month to process.

12:35.838 --> 12:39.508
These fucking bureaucrats upstairs,
they do everything at a snail's pace.

12:40.426 --> 12:44.263
In the meantime, we're going to figure out
a way to get you properly compensated.

12:46.348 --> 12:47.183
Yeah.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.978
New baby, promotion, raise.
What's with the face?

12:52.646 --> 12:54.064
What's with Dorsey?

12:54.940 --> 12:56.567
You said you had it handled.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.779
Well, I see you got a lot to learn.

13:00.404 --> 13:01.572
I said I'm handling it.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.159
And when we are gonna tell me
they released the guy?

13:10.206 --> 13:11.791
That Butler kid is dead.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.459
So relax.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.755
Because now I got a murder on my hands?

13:19.798 --> 13:21.634
Oh, yeah, I'll fucking relax.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.803
You watch your tone with me.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.438
I suggest in the very near future
you get rid of that truck.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.066
But right now, why don't you just
get me another beer, all right?

13:39.068 --> 13:40.569
You can get your own fucking beer.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.774
[man] Hey, there, Petey-Boy.
I was in the neighborhood.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.067
[laughs]

14:20.150 --> 14:21.360
How's the runt doing?

14:22.319 --> 14:23.904
Yeah, your wife told me.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.281
Marie.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.408
That's her name, right?

14:27.825 --> 14:29.034
[laughs]

14:30.202 --> 14:32.830
This is a very nice house you have.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.500
-Me? I got a room over in Newark.
-What do you want?

14:38.294 --> 14:41.922
I sure would love to meet
my first grandson, Petey-Boy.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.345
I got to go. I, uh...

14:50.639 --> 14:52.683
I'll see you around, okay?

14:53.183 --> 14:54.476
Well, yeah. Hey, listen.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.271
You think you could let me hold
a few bucks

14:57.354 --> 14:59.315
until I get on my feet, Petey?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.984
-Bridge the gap--
-[laughs]

15:05.946 --> 15:08.198
-I should've known that was coming.
-What?

15:08.991 --> 15:11.869
Your old man can't ask for a little help
once in a while?

15:11.952 --> 15:14.121
You don't got it to give, don't give it.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.422
Here's 200 dollars, Pop.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.721
That'll get you back to Newark.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.734
Hey! [chuckles]

15:44.860 --> 15:45.861
Petey-Boy.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.614
[chuckles] Petey-Boy!

15:48.697 --> 15:49.907
[laughing]

16:02.252 --> 16:03.212
[paint splatters]

16:09.760 --> 16:10.928
[sighs]

16:14.890 --> 16:16.141
[can clattering]

16:16.225 --> 16:18.060
[front door opens and closes]

16:22.314 --> 16:25.317
Uh... got the invoice
from the funeral director.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.277
It's gonna cost a grip.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.614
They got bills just like everybody else.

16:31.907 --> 16:36.620
Mortgage, water, power...
they ain't gonna pay themselves.

16:36.704 --> 16:37.663
Yeah, I-- I get that,

16:37.746 --> 16:41.208
but then your people at the church house
hit me with a bill for...

16:41.709 --> 16:43.961
something they call, "Bereavement Care."

16:44.712 --> 16:48.424
I mean, how much money you and Tricey
give them people every Sunday

16:48.507 --> 16:50.676
and they're gonna give you a bill
to bury your own son?

16:50.759 --> 16:52.428
Just tell them I'll take care of it.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.055
Whatever it is, I'll pay it.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.725
Niggas on the block selling dope,
church is slanging hope.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.519
-That's scripture, right?
-Don't blaspheme in my house, you hear?

17:00.894 --> 17:01.812
Don't do it.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.165
If I could carry it for you, 'Saiah...

17:23.459 --> 17:24.418
I would.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.466
No, I ain't going to put this on nobody.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.847
Take some of that food up to Latrice.
She need to eat. She ain't eating.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.478
[door opens]

17:55.282 --> 17:56.909
Good afternoon, Counselor.

17:58.035 --> 17:58.911
Afternoon.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.706
-I've got a B&E on Reginald Dukes, 16.
-Uh-huh.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.084
He's a sophomore
at The Alternative School.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.419
No prior felonies or misdemeanors.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.005
I'd like the State to go with us
on two years' probation,

18:10.089 --> 18:11.548
right to expunge after three.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.383
The family is struggling financially

18:13.467 --> 18:15.677
and can't afford to miss work
attending trial.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.264
My boss would never go for probation.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.351
Thirty days in juvie with restitution.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.062
[gavel banging]

18:25.687 --> 18:32.069
[bailiff] The State of New Jersey v.
Reginald Dukes, case number 12041906.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.029
Counsel is present, Your Honor.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.408
[judge] Ms. Harper,
are we ready to proceed?

18:39.743 --> 18:40.953
Uh... yes, Your Honor.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.706
In the matter of Reginald Dukes...

18:48.544 --> 18:50.295
I recommend Pretrial Intervention,

18:50.838 --> 18:54.007
contingent upon completion
of 60 hours of community service...

18:54.091 --> 18:54.925
This is good.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.344
...and immediate enrollment
in a program for at-risk youth.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.556
Pending State progress review
after six months,

19:00.639 --> 19:02.349
dismissal and release to his parents.

19:02.432 --> 19:06.061
Ms. Harper, on what grounds are you basing
the State's recommendation?

19:08.564 --> 19:12.442
This is the defendant's first offense,
Your Honor, and it's a nonviolent one.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.863
While the offer of the State
is very generous, Ms. Harper,

19:16.488 --> 19:19.658
I believe this is a teachable moment
for young Master Reginald.

19:21.743 --> 19:25.247
Ninety days Juvenile Correctional,
one year probation.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.500
I'm not being generous, Your Honor,
I'm trying to be fair.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.252
I'll determine what's fair.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.712
By making him a criminal?

19:34.047 --> 19:34.882
Next case.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.511
[bailiff] The State of New Jersey
v. Alfred Jenkins,

19:39.595 --> 19:43.599

19:44.057 --> 19:45.559

19:48.937 --> 19:52.149

19:52.441 --> 19:54.443
[in English]
Way above my pay grade, bro. Sorry.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.612
Yo, Osorio, got a second?
I've been looking for you.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.906
-Gotta get back on the clock.
-Make your money, man.

19:58.989 --> 20:02.034
-Just looking for a heads-up. We cool?
-Yeah, we're good, man.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.619
-All right.
-Yeah.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.289
Was that your boyfriend?

20:07.414 --> 20:08.415
Fucking reporter.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.501
Gave him the time of day once,
now he thinks we're<i> puro sangre brahs.</i>

20:11.585 --> 20:12.419
Fuck that.

20:13.128 --> 20:15.297
Ugh, like I need this shit,
but fuck it, right?

20:15.380 --> 20:18.592
One of the team just had a kid.
We get the leftovers. What you gonna do?

20:18.675 --> 20:22.930
Hey, listen, I need to know all the spots
in JC where dopers cop their heroin.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.349
-Want dope? I can get you dope.
-[laughs]

20:25.432 --> 20:28.602

Being a cop is a great cover.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.188
I'm tracking a witness
in that hit-and-run.

20:31.271 --> 20:34.024
The kid fucking died, man.
It's officially in my queue now.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.653
Yeah? Um...

20:39.404 --> 20:41.990
That skate park on Garfield,
that's got dope traffic.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.951

20:44.034 --> 20:44.910
So what?

20:45.577 --> 20:48.205
This witness actually see it?
The hit-and-run?

20:48.330 --> 20:51.041
I don't know. Spoiled rich girl.
Wrong place, wrong time.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.502
Sooner you get me that list,
I get eyes on those spots

20:53.585 --> 20:55.587
-round the clock.
-Yeah, sure.

20:55.712 --> 20:58.382
If you want, I can get her 411
circulated myself.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.341
What's her name?

20:59.716 --> 21:04.346
She's probably going by a street alias,
but I got her pic right here.

21:06.181 --> 21:08.183
-Anything? [sniffs]
-Mm-mm.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.394
Yeah, well look,
I'm just trying to run up some OT,

21:10.477 --> 21:13.480
so if you get me that list,
I'll make copies of this and um...

21:13.563 --> 21:16.817
you know, I'll file a worker's comp
if my wrist goes out, yeah?

21:17.442 --> 21:18.360
Yeah, all right.

21:18.485 --> 21:21.863
Detective, there's an Alison Royster
out front. Says she knows you.

21:23.115 --> 21:23.991
Fuck me.

21:25.575 --> 21:26.994
That's why I need the OT.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.078
[scoffing chuckle]

21:33.542 --> 21:35.711
Crossing the bridge
for booty calls now, Alison?

21:36.753 --> 21:38.130
Can we talk in private?

21:38.380 --> 21:40.340
No. No I'm good right here.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.259
Our last one-on-one didn't go
so well for me.

21:42.342 --> 21:45.721
It's costing me $1100 a month
plus custody of my kid.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.848
Is acting like a child

21:47.931 --> 21:49.474

-Excuse me.

21:49.641 --> 21:50.475
Hi.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.729
Yeah, well, it's always
about what works for you, isn't it?

21:54.354 --> 21:57.649
Sixty hours a week plus a part-time
and you think this was about me?

21:57.733 --> 21:59.401
If you didn't want us,
why didn't you leave?

21:59.484 --> 22:01.987
Ah. That's what I like,
that passion, right there.

22:02.070 --> 22:05.073
Pretty convincing. You saving that for
court or later with your new boyfriend?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.284
-[chuckles] Joe is not a boy.
-That's cute.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.245
You're not keeping my kid from me.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.205
I don't want to keep Maggie from you.

22:12.998 --> 22:16.043
But we don't gotta drag her into
a courtroom just 'cause we fucked up.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.172
Whatever. I'll see you in court.
Don't fucking come back here.

the Powerball than finding this vehicle.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.333
I don't have any sugar.

23:41.169 --> 23:43.964
What other good tidings
did you come here to share?

23:44.589 --> 23:47.134
-I found our girl, Nadine.
-Yeah?

23:47.300 --> 23:48.176
Yeah.

She ain't saying shit,
but she's got a habit to feed.

So, I got units on every dope corner
for when she shows up. And she will.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.517
They always come crawling back eventually.

23:58.186 --> 23:59.688

They've already been through so much.
I just...

24:04.901 --> 24:06.987
I think they need time
before they can help us.

24:08.321 --> 24:11.324

-Yes. I said I did.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.287
Do you disappoint people much?

24:16.580 --> 24:17.789
What?

24:17.873 --> 24:20.500
I mean, I don't meant to pry or nothing.

We haven't had the pleasure
of each other's company...

24:23.837 --> 24:25.881
for too long, but it occurs to me...

24:27.340 --> 24:30.135
that you might be the black sheep
of your family.

People don't like old dogs.

People get sick of old Fido
when he can't play fetch anymore,

25:15.514 --> 25:17.307
and then they dump him in some shelter.

They feed themselves all this bullshit,
like he's gonna find a new home.

Twenty-five years of service and
he ends up in a gas chamber. Fuck that.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.484
They don't save him 'cause they can't
see him, but I see him.

32:23.191 --> 32:24.025
[plate smashes]

32:26.527 --> 32:29.072
[chatter continues]

33:19.497 --> 33:21.958
[soft music playing over speakers]

33:27.505 --> 33:28.464
[music stops]

33:29.048 --> 33:30.174
You know, he would...

33:32.093 --> 33:33.511
sit right where you are...

33:34.721 --> 33:39.183
and just come alive,
listening to his music.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.936
We would drive, talk...

33:43.021 --> 33:44.063
and laugh.

33:44.605 --> 33:45.606
Sing.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.362
And he just felt...

33:52.405 --> 33:54.574
safe in here with me.

33:58.494 --> 33:59.579
He was free.

34:01.748 --> 34:04.375
I left the window to his bedroom open.

34:07.545 --> 34:08.963
I prayed to God to...

34:11.841 --> 34:13.426
let him come back to me,

34:14.886 --> 34:16.679
but he didn't hear my prayers.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.348
Not before...

34:20.683 --> 34:21.726
not now.

34:24.729 --> 34:27.440
-You should come on back inside, Tricey.
-Mm-mm.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.567
-It's cold out here.
-Mm-mm.

34:30.693 --> 34:32.987
Mmm. Mm-mm...

34:33.529 --> 34:35.114
No one understands in there.

34:35.948 --> 34:38.451
Laughing, carrying on in that house.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.746
He barely had a chance to make it his...

34:42.955 --> 34:45.124
own and a life

34:45.583 --> 34:49.087
in the house that 'Saiah said
would be our home.

34:53.633 --> 34:54.759
But in here...

34:55.718 --> 34:57.595
this is where I have Brenton.

35:00.681 --> 35:03.434
This is the only place where my baby's at.
[gasps]

35:06.187 --> 35:07.230
[sobbing]

35:07.897 --> 35:11.651
This is the only place. [gasping sobs]

35:27.083 --> 35:28.960
This is the only place.

35:30.336 --> 35:31.462
Mmm.

35:32.421 --> 35:34.632
[resumes music]

36:03.619 --> 36:06.914
[Manny] Yo, Osorio, you must be shitting
yourself now that Trump's at the wheel.

36:07.665 --> 36:10.084
Cousins need papers?
I can set 'em straight with a guy I know.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.753
-You fucking idiot, I'm Puerto Rican.
-Yeah, so?

36:12.920 --> 36:15.006
[Osorio] A US citizen,
you inbred Appalachian fuck.

36:15.089 --> 36:16.924
[Manny] Still had to swim
across the ocean--

36:17.008 --> 36:19.510
Could you shut the fuck up
for five fucking seconds?

36:27.059 --> 36:29.061
[DiAngelo] Osorio, you're coming with me.

36:29.645 --> 36:31.230
You and the rookie hold it down.

36:31.939 --> 36:33.316
And what are we doing here?

36:33.691 --> 36:37.612
You're gonna sit here and you're gonna
keep eyes out. You understand?

36:42.074 --> 36:43.075
[Di Angelo] Come on.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.871
That prick from New York says
he's got a witness.

36:47.830 --> 36:48.664
What?

36:49.415 --> 36:50.333
A witness.

36:50.958 --> 36:53.544
There's a witness, a junkie,
some white girl from the burbs.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.173
What'd she see exactly?

36:58.257 --> 36:59.133
He wasn't sure.

37:00.343 --> 37:01.928
So it's a nonissue. Don't worry.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.055
You fucking kidding?
We gotta find out who she is.

37:04.472 --> 37:05.765
And stir up more shit?

37:07.600 --> 37:08.643
You keep your mouth shut.

37:08.726 --> 37:11.812
Anyone asks what you were doing
in the park, you tell them your job.

37:14.857 --> 37:15.858
[DiAngelo] Let's go.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.444
[door buzzes]

37:23.157 --> 37:25.326
[indistinct game show chatter]

37:30.289 --> 37:31.624
What did the doctors say?

37:32.458 --> 37:33.626
Stage four.

37:34.752 --> 37:37.004
She's supposed to go real fast from here.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.841
They say all I could do
is keep her comfortable.

37:45.221 --> 37:47.932
So, I know this not a social call.

37:48.474 --> 37:50.017
The landscape is shifting.

37:51.811 --> 37:53.729
Your monthly is kicking up 12 percent.

37:55.648 --> 37:58.609
My overhead's growing,
I gotta pass the cost on.

38:01.153 --> 38:02.405
I'll render under Caesar.

38:03.322 --> 38:05.533
But I expect representation for my taxes.

38:06.575 --> 38:09.453
Now there's some renegades
trapping over on Aisles and Grand.

38:09.537 --> 38:12.039
That's cutting into the 12 percent
I got to give you.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.916
-I need that shut down.
-I can't shut down

38:14.000 --> 38:15.918
every small-time start-up in the city.

38:16.002 --> 38:18.879
You gotta at least pretend the Kings
have got some competition.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.382
[Messiah] But they're not gonna be
small-time for long, right?

38:22.466 --> 38:24.844
Now watch your ass going in there
because...

38:25.344 --> 38:26.387
shorty at the door?

38:27.138 --> 38:29.056
Ooh, he's nice with a sawed-off.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.275
What kind of heat we talking?

38:41.444 --> 38:43.654
We talking 12-gauge Remi kind of heat.

38:44.363 --> 38:48.159
First through the front door...
likely to get his head blown off.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.874
Got a lot of fucking questions,
don't you, rook?

38:56.625 --> 38:57.501
Jeez.

39:00.963 --> 39:03.090
You know, you're fucking lucky to be here.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.348
When I joined up...

39:11.849 --> 39:13.142
I kept my head down...

39:14.060 --> 39:15.061
my mouth shut...

39:16.187 --> 39:18.356
and did whatever the fuck
Di told me to do.

39:21.734 --> 39:22.651
Yeah?

39:24.487 --> 39:26.697
Is that why he left you out here
in the car?

39:27.865 --> 39:31.077
You're the liability, rook... not me.

39:43.422 --> 39:44.548
[sighs]

40:05.986 --> 40:06.904
Hi.

40:08.072 --> 40:08.989
Hi.

40:11.992 --> 40:14.078
Do you remember me, Tasha?

40:15.037 --> 40:17.498
Aunty, a lady's here!

40:17.790 --> 40:20.751
You don't have to call her.
I'm gonna... [sighs]

40:21.752 --> 40:22.670
Can I help you?

40:24.171 --> 40:25.256
Tasha, get inside.

40:25.798 --> 40:27.133
Get inside the house right now!

40:28.426 --> 40:30.386
You got no business being here!

40:31.595 --> 40:32.930
Ain't you done enough?

40:35.724 --> 40:37.143
[cell phone buzzing]

40:37.810 --> 40:40.771
Yo, where you been? I've been calling.
I've got some 411 on the uncle.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.816
He's got a juvie record, small-time
dealing back when he was a young'un.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.026
We have to talk to the Butlers.

40:47.695 --> 40:48.529
On my way.

40:50.489 --> 40:51.991
[door bell rings]

41:04.753 --> 41:07.923
I don't understand.
You said you got the man who did this.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.759
I was mistaken and I'm sorry.

41:10.885 --> 41:13.262
We both got some bad information,

41:13.345 --> 41:15.431
and had no other option
but to release him.

41:16.849 --> 41:19.018
So, you have no idea who killed my son?

41:20.936 --> 41:24.940
Nothing about the way this has been
handled should bring you any comfort.

41:27.193 --> 41:29.278
We haven't found the person responsible.

41:29.820 --> 41:30.821
But we will.

41:31.572 --> 41:32.490
I will.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.410
That means no, right?

41:38.120 --> 41:41.373
Right? Because I...
I just want to be clear,

41:41.707 --> 41:44.251
and I don't want to leave
any room to be misled

41:44.710 --> 41:47.338
or misinterpret what's going on here.

41:48.380 --> 41:51.425
Because everything you guys have said
so far has been wrong.

41:53.177 --> 41:55.930
Wrong man arrested,
wrong about my son being in a gang.

41:56.013 --> 41:59.141
We had no right to imply
that Brenton was gang-affiliated.

42:04.688 --> 42:08.692
I know that we offended your family,
and I am deeply sorry.

42:09.818 --> 42:10.861
No, so am I.

42:16.033 --> 42:18.494
With your permission,
we'd like to search your son's room.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.165
He's not there.

42:26.585 --> 42:28.045
The man who killed my son.

42:31.465 --> 42:32.883
Look all you like.

42:34.885 --> 42:35.761
[Fish] Upstairs?

42:38.597 --> 42:39.431
Thank you.

42:43.102 --> 42:45.062
[Fish]
You didn't have to apologize to her.

42:46.230 --> 42:49.066
It didn't cost me anything
and it meant something to her.

42:49.149 --> 42:52.987
When did we get in the business
of making people feel warm and fuzzy, hmm?

42:56.865 --> 43:00.160
You don't have to worry
about having that effect on anyone.

43:03.914 --> 43:06.250
People don't know their families
like they think they do.

43:08.377 --> 43:09.712
[Fish] Brenton Butler's uncle...

43:10.504 --> 43:13.924
used to run around with a guy named
Vontrell Odoms back in the day,

43:14.300 --> 43:15.426
AKA Messiah.

43:16.510 --> 43:18.637
This Messiah kid today...

43:19.972 --> 43:22.808
just happens to be JC's ruling drug king.

43:31.984 --> 43:33.068
Look at this.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.114
A burner.

43:38.741 --> 43:39.950
Rolled up in a sock.

43:40.951 --> 43:42.411
Thug life runs in the family.

43:44.788 --> 43:45.706
It's dead.

43:47.541 --> 43:49.752
So, maybe it was something
he had years ago.

43:50.586 --> 43:52.880
Could be.
Let's get a charger and find out.

44:04.558 --> 44:06.560
[distant siren wailing]

44:08.145 --> 44:11.649
[Pete] I wanted to join this unit to bust
dealers, not fucking roll with them.

44:11.732 --> 44:15.277
But whatever you got going on the side,
I don't want any part of it.

44:16.779 --> 44:19.031
I didn't become a cop to break the rules.

44:19.281 --> 44:22.242
So, what happened in the park,
that's not breaking the rules?

44:23.577 --> 44:24.828
I was following orders.

44:27.373 --> 44:28.624
Is that what you call it?

44:33.629 --> 44:34.463
Get out.

44:35.464 --> 44:36.632
[Pete] Hey, where are we?

44:36.715 --> 44:39.218
-[Manny] Took you long enough.
-[Osorio] We got to go.

44:40.636 --> 44:41.929
Welcome to Narco, rook.

44:47.601 --> 44:48.602
[DiAngelo] Osorio.

44:52.648 --> 44:53.565
Jablonski.

44:55.150 --> 44:57.277
-[Pete] Hey, who are we busting?
-Wilcox.

44:58.237 --> 45:01.115
When we get the call it's bad guys,
we get to go to work.

45:03.784 --> 45:05.035
Don't get none on you.

45:05.702 --> 45:06.620
[DiAngelo] Here you go.

45:07.037 --> 45:08.288
Aren't we calling backup?

45:08.497 --> 45:10.833
No time for that. We gotta do this now.

45:11.041 --> 45:13.085
Osorio, Wilcox,
you take the back entrance.

45:13.168 --> 45:16.797
Jablonski, you're first
through the front door.

45:34.565 --> 45:35.816
On the blast, gentlemen.

45:36.358 --> 45:37.860
You'll know when you hear it.

45:38.152 --> 45:39.153
Jablonski.

45:43.157 --> 45:44.158
Go.

46:05.679 --> 46:06.722
One.

46:07.848 --> 46:08.932
Two.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.144
Watch behind that door.
There's a guy with a sawed-off.

46:12.352 --> 46:13.437
Three. Go.

46:16.023 --> 46:18.317
Police! Down on the ground,
hands behind your head!

46:18.400 --> 46:19.443
[glass shatters]

46:19.526 --> 46:21.361
[chaotic shouting]

46:21.445 --> 46:23.697
[DiAngelo] Upstairs clear. Upstairs clear.

46:24.072 --> 46:26.867
Come on. On the ground,
on the ground. Don't you fucking move.

46:26.950 --> 46:29.703
Show me your hands!
Show me your fucking hands!

46:29.786 --> 46:30.954
[Pete] All right, everybody!

46:31.038 --> 46:34.333
Show me your fucking hands!
Wake the fuck up! Wake up!

46:35.209 --> 46:38.003
-Wake up! Show me your fucking hands!
-Don't shoot. Don't shoot!

46:38.086 --> 46:40.714
-[man] I didn't do anything.
-[overlapping shouts]

46:40.839 --> 46:44.343
-You didn't do it? You don't fucking know?
-I don't know, man!

46:44.426 --> 46:47.012
-Don't fucking know? Don't fucking know?
-I don't know.

46:47.095 --> 46:50.224
-Fuck!
-[man] I don't know! [wailing]

46:50.808 --> 46:53.894
-God--
-He's done! All right? Done!

46:53.977 --> 46:55.145
[man sobbing]

46:58.190 --> 47:00.192
-[indistinct chatter]
-[DiAngelo gasping]

47:01.151 --> 47:03.570
[panting]

47:09.201 --> 47:12.663
Get me a fucking EMT
at 22 Grand Avenue.

47:15.832 --> 47:18.585
This is Sergeant Mike DiAngelo,
Badge 3499.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.671
Get me a fucking ambulance here
right now.

47:21.672 --> 47:22.506
Come on.

47:23.799 --> 47:24.758
Fuck.

47:24.841 --> 47:25.676
Come on.

47:26.677 --> 47:28.512
-Come on.
-Oh, shit.

47:31.181 --> 47:32.224
Mike.

47:35.894 --> 47:36.937
Come on, Mike.

47:37.020 --> 47:39.273
Di, come on, man,
that's not gonna do nothing.

47:39.773 --> 47:40.816
Come on.

47:40.941 --> 47:41.775
Come on, come on.

47:42.609 --> 47:44.695
He's dead, you can't help him.

47:44.861 --> 47:46.071
Come on, bro. Come on.

47:46.363 --> 47:48.323
-Come on, come on.
-Don't fucking touch me!

47:56.748 --> 47:58.125
-[grunts]
-[man cries out]

47:59.918 --> 48:02.045
-[man groans, sobs]
-[Osorio] Di.

48:30.949 --> 48:33.827
Tricey, I stopped off,
got those éclairs you like.

48:56.642 --> 48:57.768
Latrice...

48:59.936 --> 49:01.396
you can't keep on like this.

49:05.609 --> 49:07.319
The man who did this is free.

49:10.489 --> 49:11.740
They didn't catch him.

49:13.659 --> 49:16.953
Brenton is dead
and whoever did this is free.

49:35.889 --> 49:38.517
-[low chatter]
-[sirens wail in distance]

49:43.522 --> 49:46.566
I need to talk to the detective
who's overseeing my son's case.

49:46.650 --> 49:47.818
You got a name?

49:48.068 --> 49:51.321
-Butler. Brenton Butler.
-I meant the detective's name.

49:51.738 --> 49:53.782
I don't know his name,
but I need to talk to him now.

49:53.865 --> 49:55.909
He just left my house.
Get him down here right now.

49:55.992 --> 49:58.537
Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen
without a name. Sorry, sir.

49:58.620 --> 49:59.913
I just put my boy in the ground,

49:59.997 --> 50:03.500
and the man responsible is walking around
right now living his life.

50:03.875 --> 50:05.794
-[officer] Sir--
-He's free and my boy is gone.

50:05.877 --> 50:07.254
Sir, I need you to calm down.

50:07.337 --> 50:09.923
