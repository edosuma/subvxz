WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.840
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:31.720 --> 00:32.720
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.320
Fine.

00:45.160 --> 00:48.360
JANITOR

00:56.880 --> 00:59.560
Come on, let's hurry!
We don't have all night.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.800
Is this the Queen's Necklace?

01:51.480 --> 01:52.320
Yeah.

01:58.800 --> 02:02.040
It'll be up for auction next week.
For over 20 million.

02:02.760 --> 02:03.600
Shit.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.880
You can afford it. It's…
A thousand years of minimum wage?

02:19.400 --> 02:22.040
THE QUEEN'S NECKLACE

02:44.360 --> 02:45.800
-That's for you.
-Thanks.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.440
You look like crap, Assane.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.320
You're handsome, but you look like crap.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.800
-Can't afford a razor?
-I can.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.240
-I'll have you know I have a job.
-A job?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.320
Why, that's wonderful.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.720
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

03:14.880 --> 03:15.840
What is it?

03:17.120 --> 03:18.720
I have to guess? It's…

03:19.320 --> 03:21.520
It's complicated and it won't last?

03:24.600 --> 03:25.440
As usual.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.240
Stop hiding things.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.040
For you, for me. For our son.

03:32.720 --> 03:36.120
-Can I see Raoul this weekend?
-Of course you can.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.800
Is he going to want to see you?

03:40.680 --> 03:43.400
-You stood him up three times.
-I'm not the perfect dad.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.960
Well, Saturday at eight?

03:54.280 --> 03:55.360
Saturday at eight.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.480
-Things are going to change, Claire.
-Yeah, we'll see.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.480
I'm going to change.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.320
Tell your son that.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.000
Here. I'm a bit late.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.240
Alimony.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.680
Keep your money.
Buy Raoul a present instead.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.200
See you Saturday.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.200
Don't be late.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.600
-Who is it?
-It's Perenna.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.880
Come in. You got the money?

05:30.360 --> 05:32.080
Actually, something came up.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.920
I don't have the cash,
and I wanted to know--

05:35.000 --> 05:37.080
Come here. Let's get some air.

05:37.160 --> 05:40.120
-What are you doing?
-Move, asshole, dammit!

05:40.200 --> 05:42.360
Wait, listen to me! Vincent!

05:42.440 --> 05:43.400
Listen to me!

05:44.040 --> 05:45.200
Oh shit!

05:46.240 --> 05:47.240
Where's my money?

05:47.760 --> 05:49.840
I don't have it.
I gave it to my son's mother.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.840
Give me more time, please.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.480
We'll pay your son's mother a visit.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.320
No! You won't go anywhere, understood?

05:58.400 --> 05:59.440
Pull me up

05:59.520 --> 06:02.240
and I'll tell you
how to make a lot of dough.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.520
More than you could ever spend.

06:04.600 --> 06:08.160
Or just toss me over.
Don't leave me hanging. I'm scared.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.920
-Kevin, pull him up.
-I'm scared.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.280
I'm a cleaner.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.040
At the Louvre.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.760
-What a shitty job.
-Depends.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.480
What I clean is worth millions.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.760
All within my reach.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.720
-Every evening.
-I still don't see my cash.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.400
It's coming.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.840
Next Friday,
a necklace will be up for auction.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.840
It belonged to Marie-Antoinette.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.440
It's worth millions.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.160
It won't happen, because this necklace…

06:43.240 --> 06:44.240
we'll steal it.

06:46.720 --> 06:47.680
Send him flying.

06:51.080 --> 06:54.000
-Dammit, really?
-You underestimated me.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.840
You didn't look at me.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.040
You saw me…
but you didn't look at me.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.080
-Just like they don't look at us.
-Who?

07:03.160 --> 07:06.240
Those I work for, who live there,
while we live here.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.600
Those at the top
don't look at the bottom.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.040
Thanks to that, we'll be rich.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.520
I need someone
who can make good decisions fast.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.320
A strong guy.

07:19.960 --> 07:21.200
I know the museum.

07:23.760 --> 07:24.800
What do I do?

07:30.160 --> 07:31.040
Right.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.840
The auctions will be here.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.920
Careful, there are cameras everywhere.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.080
This is the only place without cameras.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.720
The janitors' locker room.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.360
Nothing valuable there.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.680
Separate hallway.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.200
Separate entrance. Separate elevator.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.000
They can't have people seeing us.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.880
That means they won't see you.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.400
-What do you mean, you?
-The three of you.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.720
Enter as janitors,
leave as millionaires.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.160
Do we rely on our good looks to get in?

08:00.240 --> 08:01.960
I'll get you in, don't worry.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.200
Where is that pass?

08:03.800 --> 08:06.680
What are you going in with?
They scan everything.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.960
Except the outgoing trash bags…

08:11.080 --> 08:13.160
and the incoming cleaning products.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.160
Fill it up as you wish.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.200
Bleach, window cleaner…

08:19.000 --> 08:20.160
or chloroform.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.920
Be in the locker room
when the auction starts.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.040
There, Vincent and Kevin,

08:25.120 --> 08:27.880
you steal the guards' uniforms, for later.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.120
Rudy, run to the surveillance room.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.600
There's one guy there. Always spaced out.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.320
No worries.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.840
Then, you deactivate the cameras.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.560
After two minutes, the cops are notified.

08:44.640 --> 08:48.120
They rush out.
It takes them three minutes to arrive.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.920
Two plus two plus three.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.960
Seven minutes to get out.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.520
-What?
-It's intense.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.280
You'll be where they keep the necklace
after the auction.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.800
Steal it and get out.

08:58.880 --> 09:03.640
Rudy'll be waiting with the fastest,
most discreet car he can find.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.160
And we're rich.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.600
You can observe pure gold

09:07.680 --> 09:09.880
suspending a river of diamonds.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.240
-Any questions?
-Questions?

09:11.880 --> 09:14.360
-What will you be doing in the meantime?
-Me?

09:15.920 --> 09:17.440
I'm buying the necklace.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.440
Please follow me
for the rest of the tour. Thanks.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.120
You work here?

09:31.560 --> 09:33.880
It's different! Are your bosses cool?

09:34.800 --> 09:37.320
Let's just say that they are presumptuous.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.640
-Presumptuous, Assane.
-Dad, seriously?

09:41.240 --> 09:42.080
Presumptuous.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.680
P-R-E

09:45.160 --> 09:46.840
S-U-M

09:47.360 --> 09:49.600
P-T-U-O

09:49.680 --> 09:50.880
U-S.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.320
Well done, my son.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.440
Mrs. Pellegrini?

10:12.520 --> 10:14.000
-Do you need help?
-No.

10:15.920 --> 10:16.920
Thank you.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.560
It's me, madam.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.320
It's Babakar.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.120
Your husband's new chauffeur.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.600
I'm sorry, excuse me.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.640
I didn't recognize you. I have a problem.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.160
-The hood, please.
-Yes, OK.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.200
Get in!

10:48.760 --> 10:50.680
Where are you and your dad from?

10:51.240 --> 10:53.640
Senegal, madam. Not far from Thies.

10:53.720 --> 10:54.800
Where is your mom?

11:00.640 --> 11:01.760
Try it now.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.880
Yeah, it's fine!

11:06.880 --> 11:08.360
Thank you very much!

11:08.960 --> 11:11.400
-I will drive you, madam.
-No, thank you.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
No, I insist.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.680
Well, then, all right.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.360
Do you know what your dad is?

11:23.080 --> 11:24.080
A gentleman.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.400
It's true.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.080
Yes, it's true.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.360
Gentleman.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.120
Good evening.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.400
Thank you.

12:26.520 --> 12:27.680
Good evening.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.240
Thank you.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.560
-Welcome, Mr. Paul…
-Sernine.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.280
Thanks.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.560
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.840
Our auction will begin soon.

13:22.440 --> 13:23.680
JANITOR

13:25.280 --> 13:27.280
JANITOR

13:32.400 --> 13:33.760
JANITOR

13:36.840 --> 13:38.320
Here. Good luck.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.760
The legendary Queen's Necklace.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.880
The necklace whose history
is intertwined with that of France.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.880
Louis XVI gave it to Marie-Antoinette.

13:49.960 --> 13:53.000
It vanished during the Revolution,
but resurfaced

13:53.080 --> 13:57.200
two decades later in the hands of Napoleon
who gave it to Joséphine.

13:58.160 --> 14:01.440
Then began an incredible journey
across all of Europe,

14:01.520 --> 14:04.320
from tsarist Russia to Constantinople.

14:04.400 --> 14:08.000
It finally ended up in the secret treasure
of the Third Reich.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.840
It was purchased by the Pellegrinis,

14:11.760 --> 14:14.600
from whom it was stolen 25 years ago.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.800
After you, sir.

14:42.120 --> 14:42.960
The door.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.760
Put the car in the garage.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.040
-I don't want it to get rained on.
-Yes, sir.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.760
Thought to be lost.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.480
In fact, it had been taken apart

15:11.560 --> 15:14.960
and its seven gemstones
were scattered across the world.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.880
They hadn't counted on
Mr. Pellegrini's tenacity,

15:17.960 --> 15:19.960
who tracked down every gemstone.

15:20.680 --> 15:24.000
Today, the reconstituted necklace 
is finally back home,

15:24.080 --> 15:25.160
here in Paris.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.360
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:27.440 --> 15:30.160
please welcome
the daughter of its owner,

15:30.240 --> 15:32.880
the delightful Juliette Pellegrini.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.160
Good evening.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.400
Mrs. Pellegrini said I could use the pool.

16:29.160 --> 16:31.320
Are you the chauffeur's son?

16:34.120 --> 16:35.120
I'm Juliette.

16:38.720 --> 16:41.720
You're supposed to answer.
It's a conversation.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.240
-My name is Assane.
-How old are you, Assane?

16:46.320 --> 16:47.320
I'm 14.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.200
Next week.

16:52.760 --> 16:53.760
Tell me, Assane.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.680
Is what I hear about Black people true?

16:57.560 --> 16:58.520
What?

16:59.240 --> 17:00.440
What are you saying?

17:01.880 --> 17:03.480
Black people can't swim?

17:04.160 --> 17:05.640
-I can swim.
-Yeah?

17:08.400 --> 17:09.240
Show me.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.240
Swim to me and I'll kiss you.

17:14.840 --> 17:15.840
A real kiss.

17:16.520 --> 17:17.880
Not like your mother's.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.560
Thank you. Good evening.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.640
When my father reconstituted
this necklace,

18:01.720 --> 18:05.000
he promised himself
he'd do something exceptional with it.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.800
That is why tonight,

18:06.880 --> 18:10.840
the sale will help create
a Hubert &amp; Juliette Pellegrini foundation.

18:11.880 --> 18:15.280
The foundation will support cultural
and artistic projects…

18:25.640 --> 18:26.640
Thank you.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.200
All right.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.280
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will now begin the auction

18:48.760 --> 18:53.560
with, for the Queen's Necklace,
a starting price of 17 million euros.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.880
Central, we're checking the locker room.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.600
Perhaps a starting bid of 18 million,

19:19.680 --> 19:22.000
as a warm-up, if I may.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.040
Who wants to bid 18 million? 18 million?

19:25.120 --> 19:27.600
Eighteen million for Herr Kruger.
Danke schoen.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.880
I have 19 million here. Thank you.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.240
Twenty million for the lady.
Thank you, madam.

19:33.080 --> 19:36.120
Twenty-one million for Herr Kruger.
Wunderbar.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.200
They're coming!

19:46.520 --> 19:47.360
Hi.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.960
Guys, it's not instantaneous!

19:59.480 --> 20:02.240
We have 29 million on the phone.
Do I see 30?

20:05.240 --> 20:06.440
Kevin!

20:09.320 --> 20:11.080
Central!

20:12.960 --> 20:15.960
Thirty-two million for Herr Kruger.
Do I see 33?

20:16.040 --> 20:18.360
We are at 32 million
for the Queen's Necklace.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.960
Central, you OK in the locker room?

20:25.160 --> 20:26.360
Central, you OK?

20:31.600 --> 20:33.160
Yes. False alarm.

20:38.120 --> 20:38.960
Copy that.

20:42.520 --> 20:46.560
Thirty-two million going once,
32 million euros going twice…

20:47.240 --> 20:50.600
I have a 33 million bid
from the gentleman over there.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.240
Thirty-three million? I…

20:55.320 --> 20:56.720
Excuse me. Thank you.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.040
PERSONAL WEALTH 576 MILLION EUROS

21:03.200 --> 21:04.040
Very good.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.360
We're at 33 million euros

21:07.440 --> 21:09.480
for this gentleman.
Welcome to the bidding!

21:10.440 --> 21:11.720
Thirty-three million.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.160
How can you say such a thing?

21:14.840 --> 21:17.280
Do you have any idea
of the situation I'm in?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.680
You've got me by the throat, dammit!

21:21.640 --> 21:25.240
Please, do go ahead.
I don't pay you to read.

21:30.760 --> 21:34.520
Excuse my husband.
He's worried about his business.

21:35.480 --> 21:36.320
Yeah.

21:37.720 --> 21:38.560
I understand.

21:38.640 --> 21:39.960
Take a book for your son.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.600
Yes. Pick one.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.400
Well?

21:58.480 --> 22:00.880
Arsène Lupin, Gentleman Burglar.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.320
Great choice.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.440
Do I have 36?
Thirty-six for Herr Kruger. Thank you.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.920
Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven million.

22:09.000 --> 22:09.840
Thirty-eight?

22:10.360 --> 22:12.120
Thirty-nine million euros.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.960
Do I see 40 million euros?

22:15.040 --> 22:17.240
I don't have 40?

22:17.880 --> 22:19.520
Thirty-nine million going once…

22:23.280 --> 22:25.600
Thirty-nine million euros going twice…

22:26.120 --> 22:29.400
Thirty-nine… 40 million for Herr Kruger.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.560
I'm at 40 million from our first bidder,

22:32.640 --> 22:35.840
We would've saved some time
if we had started off at this price.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.120
Never mind. That's OK.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.760
Shit. He's good!

23:02.080 --> 23:02.920
Excuse me?

23:05.880 --> 23:06.760
Shit.

23:24.600 --> 23:25.440
Come on.

23:27.720 --> 23:28.600
Come on.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.160
-Seven minutes.
-Forty million euros.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.760
Do I have a bid for 41 million euros?
41 million, sir.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.200
Cameras… off.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.480
LET ME KNOW WHEN IT'S DONE

23:42.560 --> 23:44.040
Forty-one million euros.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.600
Do I see 42? Forty-one million euros…

23:47.800 --> 23:52.280
Do I have 42 million euros anywhere?

23:53.080 --> 23:55.600
Sir,
you're already holding the highest bid.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.400
Indeed.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.280
But I think this auction
is dragging on a bit.

24:03.480 --> 24:06.080
Let's save some time.
I bid 60 million euros.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.880
-Did I hear 60 million euros?
-Correct.

24:10.480 --> 24:14.040
Sixty million euros! Listen…

24:14.120 --> 24:15.520
Ladies and gentlemen,

24:15.600 --> 24:18.280
the moment of truth. Sixty million euros.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.400
I can't breathe in this.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.400
Any other bidders
for the Queen's Necklace?

24:25.160 --> 24:26.120
No?

24:26.920 --> 24:29.200
60 million euros for the gentleman

24:29.280 --> 24:32.000
going once, 60 million euros going twice,

24:32.080 --> 24:33.880
60 million euros going thrice.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.920
Sold to the gentleman. Well done!

24:49.400 --> 24:50.880
He could double-cross us.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.280
Don't worry. We'll double-cross him first.

25:00.760 --> 25:01.600
Thank you.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.440
Five minutes!

25:07.200 --> 25:08.360
Five minutes!

25:12.760 --> 25:15.240
Everything seems to be in order.
Thank you.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.120
I must admit, Mr. Sernine,
I wasn't expecting a buyer like you.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.120
Like me?

25:22.520 --> 25:23.640
Meaning?

25:23.720 --> 25:25.040
Well…

25:26.560 --> 25:27.600
So young!

25:29.920 --> 25:32.200
Here is your necklace!

25:32.280 --> 25:36.040
Just as soon as your money transfer
is validated, of course.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.280
Of course.

25:37.360 --> 25:40.280
Mr. Pellegrini is very strict
about procedure.

25:40.360 --> 25:41.400
Actually,

25:41.480 --> 25:44.400
his daughter would like to meet you.
In case…

25:45.480 --> 25:46.840
No, I would rather not.

25:49.640 --> 25:50.640
Can I see it?

25:54.320 --> 25:56.720
For that price. Just a peek.

25:57.360 --> 26:00.240
-This necklace is my baby now.
-Of course.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.160
All right!

26:03.040 --> 26:04.040
Thank you.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.440
The necklace is always inside!

26:19.360 --> 26:21.120
Can you access my study?

26:22.520 --> 26:24.840
-Yes, but--
-You know the safe is here.

26:25.480 --> 26:26.600
-No!
-Of course not.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.200
I saw you lurking around the other day.

26:34.520 --> 26:36.120
I was dusting the bookcase.

26:36.640 --> 26:39.120
-Madam was here!
-Don't involve her!

26:40.120 --> 26:41.840
The truth, Lieutenant Dumont,

26:41.920 --> 26:45.520
is that he's in a precarious situation,
an injustice, he says.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.120
He stole the necklace from me
as revenge.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.520
On my son's life, I never touched it!

26:50.600 --> 26:52.440
-Then who else?
-I don't know!

26:52.520 --> 26:55.480
Calm down.
We'll clear this up at the station.

26:55.560 --> 26:58.000
-All right?
-Take out this…

26:58.080 --> 26:59.400
This what? Huh?

26:59.480 --> 27:00.520
This what?

27:01.200 --> 27:03.560
-Calm down! Let's go.
-Let go of me!

27:03.640 --> 27:07.000
-Help me, Mrs. Pellegrini!
-Let's go!

27:07.080 --> 27:09.440
-Let's go!
-Tell my son!

27:09.520 --> 27:12.640
I'm innocent! Let go of me!

27:20.280 --> 27:21.240
There.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.720
Stop!

27:33.760 --> 27:35.480
You really don't mess around.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.600
-Evening. National police.
-Good evening.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.880
Turn it off if you're not driving.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.720
Yes, of course.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.000
-Think about the planet.
-Exactly.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.800
-Have a good evening.
-You too.

28:01.840 --> 28:02.760
Come on, guys.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.080
I didn't do anything. I'll say--

28:31.400 --> 28:33.360
Hey! What are you playing at? Get out!

28:40.160 --> 28:41.000
Let's go!

28:43.200 --> 28:44.040
Help!

28:44.600 --> 28:45.440
Thief!

28:46.200 --> 28:47.040
Thief!

29:12.480 --> 29:14.320
There was a robbery. No one can leave.

29:14.400 --> 29:15.960
Let me check with Central.

29:16.560 --> 29:20.160
Central! Two men are escaping
through the janitors' hallway!

29:24.880 --> 29:26.440
Damn. Come on!

29:30.480 --> 29:31.720
What's with this car?

29:33.800 --> 29:35.720
There was nothing more discreet?

29:35.800 --> 29:38.160
-What were you thinking?
-It's all there was!

29:38.240 --> 29:39.320
Come on! Get in!

29:40.560 --> 29:41.880
I'm gonna kill you!

30:21.280 --> 30:23.520
-Your father is on the way.
-Thank you.

30:47.040 --> 30:47.880
D3!

30:54.240 --> 30:55.960
Diop. Visitor.

30:56.920 --> 30:57.760
Diop?

30:58.320 --> 30:59.160
Shit.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.880
Call a doctor, fast! Suicide in D3!

31:25.360 --> 31:26.400
Hello, Assane.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.240
I'm sorry.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.440
Can I do anything?

31:39.600 --> 31:40.600
Yes, madam.

31:42.600 --> 31:43.600
Thank you, madam.

31:46.440 --> 31:47.280
Sorry, madam.

31:51.600 --> 31:52.680
Go to hell, madam.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.920
Rudy, I'm gonna kill you!

32:13.000 --> 32:14.560
I swear it's not my fault!

32:20.320 --> 32:22.400
It's that shitty car you got!

32:22.480 --> 32:24.040
More power than I thought.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.400
Let me go!

32:26.480 --> 32:28.120
Kevin, don't move!

32:29.200 --> 32:30.680
It doesn't even have ABS!

32:33.880 --> 32:37.920
Nobody touch anything.
I want statements from everyone.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.600
You must be joking?
He's the victim! He was roughed up!

32:42.360 --> 32:44.160
Even though we fought back.

32:44.240 --> 32:47.600
Leave it, Thibault.
I'm at the captain's disposal.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.520
Never heard of your company, Nanobay.

32:51.200 --> 32:54.160
-What is it?
-You used your cell phone today?

32:54.960 --> 32:57.400
-Yes.
-I've made money thanks to you.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.560
-Hello?
-Captain, it's Guédira.

33:04.640 --> 33:07.240
We're at the station.
Questioning the suspects

33:07.320 --> 33:09.440
about accomplices inside the museum.

33:09.520 --> 33:12.040
-You checked the necklace?
-We got it back.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.560
-It'll be analyzed at the lab.
-Great.

33:14.640 --> 33:17.960
Captain, I have a question.
Are you familiar with Arsène Lupin?

33:19.520 --> 33:21.360
What are you talking about?

33:21.440 --> 33:23.200
This necklace story is reminding me of

33:23.280 --> 33:26.120
the adventures of Arsène Lupin.
I've read them…

33:26.200 --> 33:29.000
-Not now. Wait for the results.
-OK.

33:29.640 --> 33:31.360
-I'm going.
-OK, thanks.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.400
We have the necklace and the thieves.

33:35.480 --> 33:38.200
-Go home. We'll call you if necessary.
-Are you sure?

33:38.280 --> 33:40.560
-Yes, it's fine. Go ahead.
-Thank you.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.120
-Thibault.
-Mr. Sernine.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.760
-We'll meet again for the necklace.
-Thanks.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.240
Mr. Sernine?

34:01.320 --> 34:02.240
Would you mind?

34:03.640 --> 34:04.640
You want to search me?

34:17.640 --> 34:18.720
It was a souvenir.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.520
Am I under arrest?

34:26.840 --> 34:28.080
Thank you, Inspector.

34:40.600 --> 34:44.520
We've learned tonight that
the alleged thief of the Queen's Necklace

34:44.600 --> 34:47.920
killed himself
in a prison in the Parisian area.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.720
The man, a father originally from Senegal,

34:50.800 --> 34:54.000
was the main suspect
in the disappearance of the jewelry.

34:54.520 --> 34:57.640
His death leaves investigators
with no credible lead

34:57.720 --> 35:01.360
to solve the theft
of this priceless artifact,

35:01.440 --> 35:04.040
purchased by the Pellegrini family
years ago.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.200
A staff member of the main house

35:07.280 --> 35:09.200
allegedly stole the necklace…

35:15.560 --> 35:16.400
What?

35:17.000 --> 35:18.480
You remind me of your mother.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.560
Happy birthday.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.920
Arsène Lupin, Gentleman Burglar.

36:10.240 --> 36:13.520
"This is the story of a thief.
But not just any thief."

36:16.160 --> 36:20.080
"The first thing you need to know
is that no one knows who he is."

36:22.160 --> 36:24.000
"You may have come across him."

36:26.040 --> 36:27.440
"Let's not get carried away."

36:28.280 --> 36:29.960
"Let's start from the beginning."

36:40.520 --> 36:44.640
2 WEEKS EARLIER

36:55.000 --> 36:57.080
Good morning to all our viewers.

36:57.160 --> 36:59.280
Welcome to our morning edition.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.840
We're starting off with some history

37:01.920 --> 37:03.960
and this breaking news
we have just received:

37:04.040 --> 37:07.640
the Queen's Necklace,
which once belonged to Marie-Antoinette,

37:07.720 --> 37:10.040
was found last week.

37:10.120 --> 37:11.800
The priceless necklace

37:11.880 --> 37:14.560
had vanished
following a theft 25 years ago.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.560
It'll be exhibited at the Louvre

37:16.640 --> 37:19.120
before being put up for auction
by its owners,

37:19.200 --> 37:21.600
the Pellegrini family. This auction…

37:21.680 --> 37:25.240
THE AUCTION WILL BE HELD AT THE LOUVRE

37:25.320 --> 37:27.640
"Arsène Lupin is a man of many talents."

37:28.280 --> 37:31.560
"He is a master of disguise.
He can change his identity

37:31.680 --> 37:32.840
in an instant."

37:34.640 --> 37:35.880
I have no openings.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.800
But the agency told me that…

37:37.880 --> 37:39.120
The agency was wrong.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.200
-Where in Senegal are you from?
-Bakel. Know it?

37:46.280 --> 37:47.440
My dad's town!

37:48.760 --> 37:52.320
We'd go grocery shopping at this guy's,
near the gas station.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.040
You know Abdoulaye?

37:54.120 --> 37:55.640
Yeah, I know Abdoulaye!

37:57.640 --> 38:00.200
Let's hurry! We don't have all night.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.520
"You should never trust Arsène Lupin."

38:04.600 --> 38:06.560
"His name might not even be Lupin."

38:07.160 --> 38:08.920
"In reality, he has countless names."

38:09.880 --> 38:12.000
Luis Perenna, there's a shitty name!

38:12.880 --> 38:14.960
-You want cash?
-Yeah.

38:15.720 --> 38:18.720
I'll give you 1,000.
Interest is 10% a week.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.520
-Ten per week?
-Yeah.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.240
-Not good?
-Fine.

38:23.280 --> 38:25.640
You get me. Ever try to screw me over…

38:28.080 --> 38:30.080
-Thanks.
-Don't come back without the money.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.840
"Lupin uses his talents
to commit his larcenies."

38:36.120 --> 38:38.200
"No obstacle can thwart his plans."

38:41.040 --> 38:42.680
"His greatest talent…"

38:45.360 --> 38:46.720
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.

38:46.800 --> 38:48.800
"…is to always be one step ahead."

38:59.040 --> 39:00.240
Very good.

39:01.720 --> 39:03.760
"Arsène Lupin is a lone wolf…

39:06.200 --> 39:08.240
who occasionally calls upon his friends…

39:09.600 --> 39:11.320
with questionable morals

39:11.400 --> 39:13.320
but also unyielding loyalty."

39:17.520 --> 39:19.520
Here is the copy.

39:21.960 --> 39:22.960
Ah, yeah.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.800
You've surpassed yourself.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.480
I did what I could in a week.

39:28.560 --> 39:32.200
-Next time, give me more time.
-There won't be a next time.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.440
It's time to move on.

39:36.520 --> 39:38.520
It was just important to me
to get it back.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.280
Thanks, man.

39:57.800 --> 39:58.840
Let's go!

40:00.840 --> 40:02.160
Help!

40:02.240 --> 40:03.400
Thief!

40:39.120 --> 40:40.920
-Thanks.
-They scan everything.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.400
Except the outgoing trash bags

40:44.040 --> 40:46.560
and the incoming cleaning products.

40:46.640 --> 40:49.320
-That stuff stinks!
-We both agree on that.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.880
Who comes here
to change their kids' diapers?

40:52.960 --> 40:53.960
At the Louvre!

41:00.120 --> 41:01.360
Enter as janitors…

41:04.440 --> 41:05.880
leave as millionaires.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.400
Hello? Yes, Lieutenant?

41:47.680 --> 41:48.680
We just got back.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.240
Great, thank you.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.240
Hey, Guédira.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.200
According to the lab,
the necklace is fake.

41:56.800 --> 41:59.040
Let the buyer know. Paul Sernine.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.760
-How is it spelled?
-Paul. P-A-U-L.

42:01.840 --> 42:03.360
Sernine with an S.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.160
Yes, Lieutenant.

42:08.680 --> 42:11.280
Small-time thugs.
Convictions for minor offenses.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.200
Three, yeah.

42:15.080 --> 42:16.560
I'll send you their statements.

42:17.920 --> 42:19.920
No worries. Thanks. See you later.

42:21.360 --> 42:23.920
ARSÈNE LUPIN, GENTLEMAN BURGLAR

42:43.560 --> 42:45.280
-See you.
-Yeah, see you.

42:56.160 --> 42:57.600
Huh, you're early.

42:58.080 --> 43:00.080
I told you. I've changed.

43:01.600 --> 43:03.160
Raoul! Dad's here!

43:03.240 --> 43:05.840
-He's not late?
-Thanks for your faith in me!

43:06.760 --> 43:09.400
I won't ask you what you did last night.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.680
-Honestly, nothing special.
-Yeah?

43:12.760 --> 43:13.920
-Chilled.
-Sure.

43:21.480 --> 43:23.240
-Better, right?
-Thank you.

43:26.960 --> 43:28.400
So? Don't I look classy?

43:30.200 --> 43:31.240
Are you kidding me?

43:32.960 --> 43:34.640
-You OK?
-You're crushing me.

43:34.720 --> 43:36.800
I'm your father.
I'm supposed to crush you.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.840
-Not too late, OK?
-Bye, Mom!

43:43.160 --> 43:44.000
Bye.

43:44.680 --> 43:45.520
Bye.

44:03.440 --> 44:05.640
I hear you're glued to your phone.

44:06.480 --> 44:07.480
That's a shame.

44:08.640 --> 44:10.360
At your age, I liked to read.

44:10.440 --> 44:12.440
There were no phones in your day.

44:14.760 --> 44:15.600
Low blow.

44:17.400 --> 44:18.760
No present for you.

44:20.040 --> 44:21.120
What present?

44:24.120 --> 44:25.080
Here.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.320
You'll like it.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.080
Your granddad gave it to me.

44:32.280 --> 44:33.760
I wish you had known him.

44:35.800 --> 44:37.760
Arsène Lupin is more than a book.

44:38.520 --> 44:40.840
He's my heritage. My method.

44:42.200 --> 44:43.040
My path.

44:45.160 --> 44:46.160
I am Lupin.
