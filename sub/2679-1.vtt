01:00.396 --> 01:01.251
You know,

01:02.171 --> 01:05.147
I do a shitload of reading
and studying and praying,

01:05.167 --> 01:07.382
and I've come to a few
conclusions I want to share.

01:08.312 --> 01:11.779
People look at politicians and celebrities
on the TV and the newspapers,

01:11.863 --> 01:13.977
glossy magazines.
What do they see?

01:14.887 --> 01:18.410
"I'm just like them.
" That's what they say. "I'm special.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.261
I'm different.
I could be any one of them."

01:20.281 --> 01:22.974
Well, guess what?
You can't. You know why?

01:23.331 --> 01:26.418
'Cause in reality, mediocrity's
where most people live.

01:26.503 --> 01:30.297
Mediocrity is the elephant in the room.
It's ubiquitous.

01:30.381 --> 01:33.213
Mediocrity in your schools.
It's in your dreams.

01:33.326 --> 01:34.781
It's in your family.

01:35.655 --> 01:37.262
And those of us who know this,

01:37.347 --> 01:41.642
those of us who understand the disease
of the dull, we do something about it.

01:41.662 --> 01:43.977
We do more because we have to.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.081
The deck was always
stacked against us.

01:46.325 --> 01:52.069
You're either a big leaguer, or you're a
slave clawing your way onto the "C" train.

01:52.089 --> 01:55.572
Some people say Jack ?bramoff moves
too fast, Jack Abramoff cuts corners.

01:55.657 --> 01:59.576
Well, I say to them, if that's the difference
between me and my family having a good life...

01:59.661 --> 02:02.759
and walkin' and using the subway
every day, then so be it.

02:03.172 --> 02:06.375
I will not allow my
family to be slaves.

02:06.459 --> 02:10.838
I will not allow the world
I touch to be vanilla.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.840
You say I'm selfish? Fuck you!

02:12.924 --> 02:14.842
I give back. I give back plenty.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.761
You say I... I got a big ego?
Fuck you twice!

02:17.846 --> 02:22.099
I'm humbly grateful for the wonderful
gifts that I've received here in America,

02:22.183 --> 02:24.893
the greatest country
on this planet.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.980
I'm Jack Abramoff.

02:28.064 --> 02:31.942
And oh, yeah,
I work out every day.

02:58.636 --> 03:02.431
Mr. Sprague.
Susan Schmidt of the Washington Post.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.476
Find it all right? Yeah.
Thanks for seeing me.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.729
I got a lot of questions for you.
Ah.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.731
Jack Abramoff, right?

03:10.815 --> 03:13.358
I hear he was charging your
tribe an exorbitant fee.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.861
Thirty million or more.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.113
So I guess you met his
partner, Mike Scanlon, too?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.657
Oh, yeah. He's a real cowboy.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.535
Looks like they might
be in some trouble.

03:32.212 --> 03:32.913
Jack?

03:33.064 --> 03:34.713
Honey. Jack. Dad!

03:34.797 --> 03:35.447
Mikey.

03:35.467 --> 03:37.716
Hey, I've been calling you all day, dude.
Where are you?

03:37.800 --> 03:39.968
I'm in L.A.
What the fuck are you doing in L.A.?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.595
Our world is collapsing here.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.680
Wait. What have you heard?
Are you gonna be indicted?

03:43.765 --> 03:46.934
Well, I got federal marshals looking for me, okay?
I've had a hundred media calls today.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.770
We're under horrific assault from
the worst forces in our culture.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.022
I know. I know. You're the only
one that's returned my calls.

03:52.106 --> 03:54.983
The president's probably destroying
every picture he ever took with you.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.736
Well, you're no one in this
town until you haven't met us.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.446
That isn't funny, Jack.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.823
Don't fucking mess
with my chi, dude.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.243
I'm serious.
We are super-fucked here, okay?

04:04.327 --> 04:06.411
They're calling us the
new Watergate, Jack.

04:06.496 --> 04:10.332
We're about to be on the Nightly News.
You need to get back to D.C., now.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.836
Step up to the line.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.298
Dear Mr. President,

04:19.841 --> 04:22.552
I write you this petition
with hope and prayers.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.391
As a man of faith, I have come to
see God move in mysterious ways.

04:29.185 --> 04:31.478
After we're born, he gives
us the choice of two paths.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.563
Please don't smile.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.024
I'm not smiling.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.611
Accept the world
for the way it is,

04:39.696 --> 04:41.863
or see it for how we
might want it to be.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.991
Turn to your right.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.702
Your right.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.999
To me, the choice was obvious.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.627
How long are you gonna
be holding me here?

04:55.712 --> 04:57.713
You can get that information
from your lawyer.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.132
I do get my own cell, right?

05:00.216 --> 05:03.051
And I only eat kosher, okay?

05:03.136 --> 05:04.970
You do serve kosher, don't you?

05:06.556 --> 05:09.599
Mr. Abramoff, this is a
federal holding facility.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.643
It's not kosher.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.631
Jack Abramoff.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.760
Snake.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.888
What are you in for, Snake?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.265
Assault and battery,

05:51.059 --> 05:52.726
resisting arrest.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.978
Chickenshit beef like that.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.189
How about you?

05:57.273 --> 06:00.525
Oh, me? I'm...

06:00.610 --> 06:04.404
I work in D.C.
I'm a... I'm a lobbyist.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.657
Lobbyist. That against the law?

06:29.972 --> 06:32.474
Next to God, faith and country,

06:32.558 --> 06:34.518
nothing is more important
than influence.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.686
Political influence.

06:38.564 --> 06:42.067
Influence with the powerful
is like influence with God.

06:42.151 --> 06:46.905
Without it, there's only eternal hellfire,
damnation and congressional logjam.

06:46.989 --> 06:51.868
Here the influence we wield is more
important than the air you breathe.

06:51.953 --> 06:56.206
As a licensed lobbyist, I am legally allowed
to accept money from special interests...

06:56.290 --> 06:59.418
in order to influence
Congress on their behalf.

06:59.502 --> 07:03.422
I'm essentially a conduit to
motivating sleepy lawmakers...

07:03.506 --> 07:05.590
into getting bills passed
and legislation done.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.969
Well, our client is extremely anxious
to know what's in your bill.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.971
The reality is,
without lobbyists,

07:11.055 --> 07:13.306
the wheels of Washington would
come to a grinding halt.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.600
About how much are you looking
to raise with the event?

07:15.685 --> 07:17.602
Can you tell me that
in dollar terms?

07:17.687 --> 07:20.439
Why? Because the most powerful
members of Congress...

07:20.523 --> 07:24.568
rely on lobbyists like me for information
to guide them on how to vote.

07:24.652 --> 07:29.364
And how they vote sometimes requires
taking them on fact-finding missions.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.617
Like House majority
leader Tom DeLay,

07:32.702 --> 07:35.871
who we brought to the Northern Mariana
Islands in the South Pacific...

07:35.955 --> 07:38.373
a U.S. territory where
my textile clients...

07:38.458 --> 07:40.792
produce American-made
designer clothes...

07:40.877 --> 07:43.170
without having to
pay minimum wage.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.714
Well, these folks seem happy.
How are you?

07:45.798 --> 07:47.591
Hello. Thank you. Uh-huh.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.760
I think we should be able to
vote favorably on this, Jack.

07:50.845 --> 07:54.347
For example, your top-of-the-line
stonewashed jeans...

07:54.432 --> 07:56.725
can stay on sale for 19.95...

07:56.809 --> 08:00.270
simply because labor costs in the
Marianas remain low. Morning.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.272
Jack is pushing Mr.
DeLay hard...

08:02.356 --> 08:05.108
to make sure the minimum wage legislation
stays off Congress's schedule.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.110
Hey, you troglodytes,
will you make sure...

08:07.195 --> 08:09.112
that DeLay gets the latest
export numbers from Willie...

08:09.197 --> 08:10.989
in case the Senate tries
to kill this thing?

08:11.073 --> 08:12.949
Oui, mon capitaine.

08:13.034 --> 08:17.579
Lobbying is nothing more than
American-style democracy in action.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.207
And the more influence we have,

08:20.291 --> 08:22.250
the bigger the smiles
on our kids' faces.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.543
Oh, my God!

08:25.505 --> 08:28.590
Good morning, gentlemen.
Grover, what brings you to the locker room?

08:28.674 --> 08:30.592
Don't even bother trying to
pitch him on our new clients.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.428
He has issues with helping
our native people.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.514
Just with Native
Americans, Jack.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.807
What do they have to do with
Americans for Tax Reform?

08:37.892 --> 08:39.433
I need your help on
this one, Grover.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.937
I need the congressional friends
in your organization...

08:42.020 --> 08:45.065
to understand that there are certain
American Indian tribes that need help.

08:45.149 --> 08:47.359
Jack, the United
States, from day one,

08:47.443 --> 08:50.862
was founded on the basis that you
could be or do anything you want to.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.864
You're in charge of
your own future.

08:52.949 --> 08:56.284
There's no ceiling. There's no floor.
You want to be a bum, you can be a bum.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.287
You want to accomplish great
things, you can do that too.

08:59.372 --> 09:03.041
So, if some Native Americans choose
to live in third world conditions,

09:03.125 --> 09:05.627
why is that my problem, hmm?

09:05.711 --> 09:07.379
Are those pistachios?

09:07.463 --> 09:09.714
- Yeah.
- Genius.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.634
- He's here, Jack.
- Listen. This is perfect for you, Grover.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.719
It's philanthropic.
I mean, the money we're saving them...

09:14.804 --> 09:17.013
is essentially paying for their
health clinics and schools.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.807
Help them help themselves.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.476
Yeah. Come on. There's no one in
this town as persuasive as you are.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.396
- You're a Harvard man, dude.
- Yeah, yeah. The man with the crimson tongue.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.608
Grover, all we're trying to do is
help these people empower themselves.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.945
Jack, I've known
you for 25 years.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.989
Why do I think your
social gravitas...

09:34.073 --> 09:38.034
is more than just about
health clinics and schools?

09:52.883 --> 09:54.884
Veuve Clicquot, sir.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.137
Thank you. You're welcome.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.433
Iced tea. Thank you.

10:01.517 --> 10:04.519
Merlot with three ice cubes.
Thank you.

10:04.604 --> 10:08.148
Dude, seriously, I think I once got
a lap dance from her at Nexus Gold.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.150
I wouldn't know, Mikey.
I'm married.

10:10.234 --> 10:13.570
I thought I recognized her too.
See? I knew it.

10:13.654 --> 10:17.574
I think the good Lord would prefer I
have deaf ears on this one, boys.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.117
We all set? Check.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.494
Eighteen holes, St.
Andrews, five-star hotel.

10:21.579 --> 10:24.956
Hugh Fraser, British Open champ, on hand
to give a lesson. La-di-fucking-da.

10:25.041 --> 10:29.127
Restaurant tour of Edinburgh and a two-day
stopover at the Hyde Park Oriental in London.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.963
Oh. V.l.P.
tickets to The Lion King for Tom.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.798
Great.

10:38.929 --> 10:43.141
Okay.
Nice soft grip, soft hands.

10:43.225 --> 10:46.269
Take a whack at her. Go on.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.356
You made contact. Great.
Now I gotta sandbag my drive...

10:49.440 --> 10:52.400
so Poncho doesn't spew in his shoes with envy?
Poncho's been primed.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.861
I've arranged to have his picture
taken with Bush when we get back.

10:54.945 --> 10:58.823
Three years ago, his tribe is weaving
pine needles and selling key chains.

10:58.908 --> 11:02.160
Now all he wants to do is drive a
Hummer and buy condos in Hawaii.

11:02.244 --> 11:06.331
Can you tell me why these clowns get
to own casinos and make 20 mil a year?

11:06.415 --> 11:08.166
Well, I don't know.
Maybe 300 years of genocide.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.169
That not a good enough reason for you, champ?
Oh. Are you part Mohawk now?

11:11.253 --> 11:12.962
Yes, indeed.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.090
Kemosabe.
One of the lost tribes of Israel.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.133
Yeah, yeah.
You're practically an Indian, dude.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.718
Probably why they
like you so much.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.929
That's what I'm talking about.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.014
You know what blows my mind?

11:23.099 --> 11:26.768
All these Indians are so damn rich, and
they're still acting like Wal-Mart shoppers.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.521
He's a multimillionaire,
Jack, with a $10 watch.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.023
Just think. If you and I could
access some of that liquid,

11:32.108 --> 11:34.234
we would be running D.C. in no time.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.236
What are you suggesting?

11:36.320 --> 11:40.407
I'm suggesting that they pay us a
ridiculous amount of money, okay?

11:40.491 --> 11:43.743
And then you and I can split
the fee 50-50 under the table.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.371
It's a little tough
on the Chippewa.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.707
Not to mention, is it legal?

11:48.791 --> 11:51.543
What are they gonna do?
Cancel my membership at the ACLU? Come on.

11:51.627 --> 11:54.546
Well, you know, I got a
limit on what I can charge.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.798
That sucks for you, but
I'm freelance, Jack.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.175
I'm grassroots, baby.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.011
You're always complaining
about living hand to mouth.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.432
You know what?
You deserve better.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.517
Okay?
And Chief Shanks-a-Lot there...

12:07.601 --> 12:10.687
is our ticket out
of hourly fee hell.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.731
That's it, Chief.

12:12.815 --> 12:16.651
Okay. Put together a pitch for Tonto.
Let's see what he says.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.903
Looks good.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.865
Now, Chief, it's a simple thing.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.867
Look.
I've handled the Coushattas,

12:23.951 --> 12:26.411
the Tiguas, the Aguas Calientes,

12:26.495 --> 12:28.413
and I tell them all the
same thing, Chief:

12:28.497 --> 12:30.832
I know what it feels like to
be a persecuted minority.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.959
Yeah? Well, it's about time
you guys in Washington...

12:33.043 --> 12:35.253
finally did something
good for Indian people.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.756
Like give America back?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.675
You got a real sense of humor, Jack.
I like that.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.887
Look. The casino is a
plus if it's profitable.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.598
But in reality, the gaming
industry is very competitive.

12:46.682 --> 12:49.851
You know, the Jena tribe, they want
to open up their own casino now.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.770
They're just one state away.

12:51.854 --> 12:55.148
Yeah, and I know those guys.
They can be brutal.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.777
They can shut you
down mega-fast.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.404
No more Chippewa casino.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.490
You need our help, Chief.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.574
Hmm.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.493
You heard Mike's proposal?

13:06.577 --> 13:10.163
It's a tough call.
It's a hell of a fee you're asking for.

13:10.247 --> 13:14.125
Kind of a record, isn't it?
But think of the billions that you're gonna save.

13:14.210 --> 13:19.005
I can guarantee you that goddamn
Jena tribe casino will never open.

13:19.089 --> 13:22.425
And before you know it, the Jena tribe's
gonna be back selling moccasins.

13:23.844 --> 13:27.180
You know, Mr. Abramoff, we
can't afford to lose this one.

13:27.264 --> 13:29.933
You won't. Swear to God.

13:33.229 --> 13:36.022
Give me five!

13:36.106 --> 13:39.400
- A toast to Team Abramoff!
- Whoo!

13:39.485 --> 13:42.320
- To Team Abramoff.
- To giving America back to the Indians.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.405
All hail to Washington's
biggest retainers.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.741
Fuckin'-A!
You are no one in this town...

13:46.826 --> 13:49.202
unless you haven't met
Jack fuckin' Abramoff.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.787
Take it easy, Bill.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.081
- Jack, you know Emily, my fiancee. Everybody.
- Oh, sure.

13:53.165 --> 13:56.209
- From the, uh, Bush inaugural.
- I'll never forget that night.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.628
McCain was in his office
pounding Bushmills. "We lost!"

13:58.712 --> 14:02.090
It's nice to see the moderates
bleed from every orifice.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.217
Amen to that.

14:04.301 --> 14:07.428
Hey, Jack.
Those Polynesian factories you rep,

14:07.513 --> 14:09.639
uh, that make the blue jeans
on the Mariana Islands.

14:09.723 --> 14:11.349
Yeah? What about them?

14:11.433 --> 14:14.018
Word on the street is they're
goddamn sweatshops and rape camps.

14:14.103 --> 14:17.772
Oh, all you guys from the Washington
Post want to be Woodward and Bernstein.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.357
- Fuckin' pathetic.
- That so?

14:19.441 --> 14:22.110
The Labor Department just fined
your client nine million dollars.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.737
- Must be for something.
- Hey, listen, Ben Bradlee.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.323
Mistakes will happen, but the truth is
you can't tell me those immigrants...

14:27.408 --> 14:30.243
aren't making more money than they would in
China and sending it back to their families.

14:30.327 --> 14:33.246
That's right, Scotty. We're just greasing
the wheel with American dollars, baby.

14:33.330 --> 14:36.124
- Capitalism at its finest.
- Doing the Lord's work.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.835
Doesn't sound much like
American democracy to me.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.546
Don't be stupid.
No democracy, no fucking capitalism.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.756
No capitalism, no
fucking democracy.

14:43.841 --> 14:47.385
Only goddamn communistic
slave-driven bolshevism.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.054
- Thank you, Joe McCarthy.
- Fuckin' elitist!

14:50.139 --> 14:51.389
What?

14:51.473 --> 14:53.182
What is wrong with you? God.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.559
Calm down!

14:54.643 --> 14:57.395
Someone call 911.
Scott is a hemophiliac.

14:57.479 --> 15:00.106
You just hit a hemophiliac
reporter from the Washington Post!

15:00.190 --> 15:02.942
Come on! Oh, great.
Another bleeding heart liberal.

15:03.027 --> 15:06.321
It's okay. It's okay. Jesus.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.157
This isn't good.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.340
Enid, get DeLay for me, will ya?

15:25.424 --> 15:28.509
Should I remind him of Bible
class Thursday afternoon?

15:28.594 --> 15:30.595
- Bible class Thursday?
- Yeah.

15:30.679 --> 15:33.222
Jack, remember, I switched
it with your golf game.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.309
Well, Enid,

15:36.393 --> 15:40.271
you know, sometimes, even those of
us who occupy the Oval Office...

15:40.356 --> 15:42.523
can have our senior moments.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.734
Yes, Mr. President.

15:44.818 --> 15:48.571
Oh, Jack, Mr. Rouvelas is here.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.657
Make sure I see it before
it goes out, okay?

15:50.741 --> 15:52.992
- Manny.
- Let's grab a coffee.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.119
Hey, listen. If it's about the
Delail incident, no worries.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.288
I fired him yesterday.
The guy was a loose cannon.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.624
It's not like the Post is an
important paper in this town.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.709
Yeah.
Can we save this for later?

16:01.794 --> 16:04.337
Bear with me. It's important.

16:04.421 --> 16:07.715
All right, Manny.
So, where's the fire?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.759
We hired you because
the partners felt...

16:09.843 --> 16:12.512
we needed someone who had friends
in the Bush administration.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.514
It's not about friends, Manny.
It's about ideas.

16:14.598 --> 16:17.141
And you guys on the Right
used to have ideas.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.269
But now that communism is gone,
all you think about is money.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.480
So, did you invite me out
for an iced vanilla chai...

16:22.564 --> 16:24.524
just to remind me that I'm
a right-wing fascist?

16:24.608 --> 16:26.526
That's kind of beneath
you, isn't it, Manny?

16:26.610 --> 16:29.946
What's beneath me, Jack, are the
clients you drag into my shop.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.490
Those bottom-feeders in the rag
trade in the Mariana Islands.

16:32.574 --> 16:35.743
You know, there is an upside
for the poor Chinese.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.246
They get to send money back to
their families in the mainland.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.957
And look at all the great work we're
doing for the Choctaw, the Chippewa.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.251
That all sounds nice and
philanthropic, Jack,

16:43.335 --> 16:45.545
but you're buddies
with the White House.

16:45.629 --> 16:49.340
Hell, you're a good reason that idiot
cinched the Republican nomination.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.467
That's 'cause we destroyed
McCain in the South.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.302
Bush still owes you.

16:53.387 --> 16:57.765
Why not use that? Aim a little
higher when bringing in clients.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.767
Such as?

16:59.852 --> 17:03.521
Such as a Fortune
500 company or two.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.940
You mean rich, white people.

17:07.859 --> 17:11.237
Listen. I've got a situation
in Florida with a client...

17:11.320 --> 17:13.196
a very important client.

17:13.281 --> 17:16.659
Your background in gaming
might help us stickhandle it.

17:19.371 --> 17:23.124
So, Indians?

17:23.208 --> 17:25.001
No. Greeks.

17:25.085 --> 17:28.337
A guy in Florida
named Gus Boulis.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.090
Bankruptcy's just the
tip of his iceberg.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.759
He needs a buyer fast.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.470
It's a very lucrative casino op.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.847
Anybody who can afford
to get in will get rich.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.810
Anyway, Manny said you'd
have some clients...

17:42.895 --> 17:45.438
who might be interested
under the circumstances.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.109
Yeah. Okay, Art.
I'll look into it.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.620
Have you done your davening yet?
Mm-hmm.

18:42.704 --> 18:45.873
Then come to bed.
Kids are asleep. It's late.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.252
What?

18:49.336 --> 18:52.213
What are you thinking? About us.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.049
Seems like only yesterday...

18:55.134 --> 18:57.635
we were kicking around with
the College Republicans.

18:57.719 --> 19:02.056
Remember that time you brought
Pavarotti to Brandeis?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.058
Nobody thought you
could pull it off.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.227
All them lefties
listening to The Clash.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.312
Hey. I like Joe Strummer.

19:08.397 --> 19:12.567
Mmm. Maybe I should have asked him to do a duet
with Pavarotti. That would have been something.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.738
I still love your
dorkiness, hon.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.616
Always thinking out of the box.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.703
Oh, Adrian...

19:23.787 --> 19:27.957
Nobody ever went the
distance with Creed.

19:28.041 --> 19:31.919
If they ring that bell
and I'm still standin',

19:32.004 --> 19:35.923
then I'll know I weren't just
another bum from the neighborhood.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.972
Come to bed.

19:44.516 --> 19:47.685
So this character Gus Boulis
comes down from Canada,

19:47.769 --> 19:50.688
opens up a chain of
sandwich shops in Miami.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.690
Then he cashes out,

19:52.774 --> 19:55.026
and he goes into the
cruise business,

19:55.110 --> 19:57.028
buys a fleet full of yachts.

19:57.112 --> 20:01.741
So, Boulis turns them into floating
casinos, runs out of nine ports.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.993
Tourists, retirees,
some high rollers.

20:04.077 --> 20:06.454
They call it "The
Cruise to Nowhere."

20:06.538 --> 20:09.582
But there's this Florida attorney general
who's got a hard-on for gamblers,

20:09.666 --> 20:11.918
looking for a technicality
to nail this guy.

20:12.002 --> 20:15.213
Problem is Boulis isn't a U.
S. citizen,

20:15.297 --> 20:19.926
which turns out to be a violation
of the Shipping Act of 1916.

20:20.010 --> 20:23.262
And then this idiot gets sloppy
about how he runs the casinos.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.640
He plays fast and
loose with the bets.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.600
He thinks he's still fooling
around with cold cuts.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.185
Blackjack. House wins.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.229
The customers start to complain.

20:31.313 --> 20:34.774
Pretty soon Boulis is catching heavy
grief with his gambling license.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.401
The gist of it is the feds
are forcing him to sell.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.904
He's got months to divest.
Gives me a window.

20:39.988 --> 20:42.198
Gives you a window?
What, are you serious?

20:42.282 --> 20:44.450
No. We're serious.

20:44.534 --> 20:47.745
145 million, dude?
How we gonna swing that?

20:47.829 --> 20:51.249
We're gonna use our most powerful
resource, Mikey: my imagination.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.960
Well, you better imagine us
as rich as the Chippewa then.

20:54.044 --> 20:57.463
So, what do you think of SunSail?
How do you think we should handle it?

20:57.547 --> 20:59.465
We need a front man.

20:59.549 --> 21:03.594
You know, someone strong enough to run a business,
but not so strong we can't control him.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.763
He needs to have his own money...

21:05.847 --> 21:08.724
so he can invest, keep
him loyal, honest.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.686
You know anybody like that?

21:17.109 --> 21:20.403
Kwikee-Mattress.
The last "S" is for "savings"!

21:22.864 --> 21:25.116
The lowest prices in
greater Bethesda,

21:25.200 --> 21:27.493
plus same-day delivery.

21:27.577 --> 21:31.289
The principles of the
Republican Party...

21:31.373 --> 21:35.376
more closely parallel the moral vision
of the God of Abraham than anyone else.

21:36.336 --> 21:39.630
So, the question: Does God...

21:39.715 --> 21:43.175
want people to be... liquid?

21:44.970 --> 21:48.097
And the answer is yes.
The answer is yes.

21:48.181 --> 21:52.143
Prosperity enables us
to do the right thing...

21:52.227 --> 21:54.687
to be able to help
our fellow man,

21:54.771 --> 21:58.024
to be stewards of civilization.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.526
ln biblical times,

22:00.610 --> 22:03.362
taxes never rose above 20%,

22:03.447 --> 22:06.657
which is a lesson we
could learn today.

22:06.742 --> 22:10.828
Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican
Party lights the way for America...

22:10.912 --> 22:14.123
and, may I say, the
rest of the globe.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.169
Ralph.

22:18.253 --> 22:20.171
Really good stuff.
Thanks for coming.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.882
Inspirational, Jack.
Thanks, Congressman.

22:22.966 --> 22:23.758
Jack. Grover.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.176
We need to talk.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.302
Sure thing, Grover.

22:29.639 --> 22:33.100
"Stewards of civilization"?
Beautiful words, Jack.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.228
Well, I only take my cue from the
most powerful man in Congress.

22:36.313 --> 22:40.107
You remember Reverend Mueller from my
home district in Texas, don't you?

22:40.192 --> 22:42.109
Pleased to see you again, Mr.
Abramoff.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.487
You know, it's refreshing to see
both Jews and Christians...

22:44.571 --> 22:46.864
working together to make
this a better world.

22:46.948 --> 22:48.407
I'm inspired, Reverend.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.993
Karl. Nice to see you, Jack.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.329
The president asked me to
tell you to come by soon.

22:53.413 --> 22:56.123
Needs a little help with his golf swing.
Happy to. Thanks, Karl.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.625
Senator. Yeah.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.836
My, uh, clients have a, uh,
substantial check for your campaign.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.381
Really?
I can't thank you enough, Jack.

23:03.465 --> 23:06.258
You know, we're really
lucky to have you.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.846
Hey, hey, hey.
Slow down, you monkeys.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.808
Thank you. Be careful with that.
See you in the car.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.769
Watch your brother, okay, honey?
What did you think of my talk?

23:16.853 --> 23:21.482
Well, except for the part where God
wants us to be financially liquid.

23:21.566 --> 23:24.068
Sounded weird. Oh.

23:24.152 --> 23:27.113
I meant abundant.
It's... It means power.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.657
Remember Exodus 32,
the golden calf?

23:29.741 --> 23:31.659
The worship of the false idol?

23:31.743 --> 23:35.246
Hold the horses.
She's quoting scripture to me.

23:35.330 --> 23:39.500
Why, Pam Abramoff, when we met,
you were reading Cosmo magazine,

23:39.584 --> 23:42.586
mispronouncing all
them Yiddish words.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.588
Kvetch. Schlemiel.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.799
I think I'm getting
the hang of it.

23:46.883 --> 23:49.802
- Jack, nice speech.
- Hey, Adam. Thanks for showing up.

23:49.886 --> 23:53.848
Wow. Really gone for
the whole Jew package.

23:53.932 --> 23:57.726
Oh, I thought it made me look
more like, uh, Don Corleone.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.855
More like Fiddler on the Roof. Hey.
Don't knock Fiddler on the Roof.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.982
lt was transformational for
me when I was a teenager.

24:03.066 --> 24:04.692
Made you want to be a milkman?

24:04.776 --> 24:06.902
No. Made me want
to be a real Jew.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.654
Hmm.

24:08.738 --> 24:11.282
Good-looking family you have.

24:11.366 --> 24:13.576
A big family you have.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.287
Pam, you remember Adam from
the College Republicans?

24:16.371 --> 24:17.746
Hello.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.874
Well, you've done an excellent
job raising the youngsters.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.626
I'm single again.
Swinging bachelor, I guess.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.879
Good luck with that.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.547
Listen. We need to talk.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.883
Can you swing by my house on Sunday?
We'll have dinner.

24:28.967 --> 24:31.343
You mean like a kind of date?

24:33.096 --> 24:36.265
What business could you possibly
have with a man like that?

24:36.349 --> 24:38.476
Honey, he's got a law degree
from Brooklyn College.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.644
He looks like a defendant
on Judge Judy.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.022
Honey.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.400
Have a little compassion.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.819
He's a partner in a
casino in Saint Martin.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.989
He's a respectable guy who knows a lot.
He could be a very useful partner.

24:52.073 --> 24:54.909
Useful for what?

24:54.993 --> 24:59.288
ln five years, our family will
be completely legitimate.

24:59.372 --> 25:02.708
Would you please stop it with that, quoting
movies all the time. It's irritating.

25:02.792 --> 25:05.169
Oh, come on, honey.
You know I love the movies.

25:05.253 --> 25:07.171
And I am a Hollywood producer.

25:09.883 --> 25:13.177
You produced two Dolph
Lundgren movies, okay?

25:13.261 --> 25:15.513
You work in Washington now.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.724
Babe, Washington is
Hollywood with ugly faces.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.726
I'm serious, Jack.

25:20.810 --> 25:23.479
He makes me nervous.

25:23.563 --> 25:28.442
And another thing. I mean, how is that
we're late with the mortgage payment?

25:29.945 --> 25:31.987
We're okay, aren't we?

25:32.072 --> 25:35.199
Oh, yeah. No. This just must
be some accounting thing.

25:35.283 --> 25:37.284
I'll look into it
in the morning.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.664
Don't worry.
Put this on my desk.

25:44.292 --> 25:46.418
I'm watching you walk away.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.338
Still watching you walk away.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.298
Walk away some more.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.934
Everybody wins.

26:04.854 --> 26:09.733
As we all know, the gaming industry
has blown up across America.

26:09.818 --> 26:12.069
This phenomenon has
given great fortune,

26:12.153 --> 26:15.489
not only to our tribe... to
our people in general.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.117
But now we're at risk
of losing everything...

26:18.201 --> 26:20.452
to the competition of
our neighboring tribes.

26:20.537 --> 26:24.790
The point is we need help in
Washington, and we need help now.

26:24.874 --> 26:27.042
And as I said in my
written statement,

26:27.127 --> 26:29.211
Mr. Abramoff here has
my full support...

26:29.296 --> 26:33.841
in recommending that he have only the
best interests of our casinos at heart.

26:38.597 --> 26:42.933
Mr. Abramoff, I've, uh,
read your proposal.

26:43.018 --> 26:47.479
I see you want one million dollars
just as a retainer to start.

26:47.564 --> 26:51.442
Well, you're asking for the best, Mr. Sprague.
We are the best. We can get it done.

26:51.526 --> 26:54.069
You want to kick some ass
on the Hill, we can do it.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.156
Let's kick some ass.

27:00.660 --> 27:03.954
That was Dolph Lundgren, not
Schwarzenegger, in case you were confused.

27:04.039 --> 27:07.750
All right. Look. Here's my advice.
It's free today.

27:07.834 --> 27:11.086
You fellas hire Michael Scanlon and
Capitol Strategies and Ralph Reed here,

27:11.171 --> 27:12.963
who, as some of you may know,

27:13.048 --> 27:16.342
at one time was the very famous right
hand of the Reverend Pat Robertson.

27:16.426 --> 27:19.887
He can organize some high-wattage
Christian opposition...

27:19.971 --> 27:21.889
to this proposed casino
by the Jena tribe...

27:21.973 --> 27:25.476
and do to them what we did to
McCain in 2000... wipe 'em out.

27:25.560 --> 27:30.439
You want $30 million in
fees over three years.

27:30.523 --> 27:32.900
I could be president
myself for that.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.073
It's just too much money.

27:39.157 --> 27:42.242
The money's worth it.
Jack will lobby for us in Washington.

27:42.327 --> 27:45.537
He can help make us one of the most
powerful tribes in the region.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.706
Our people need
more health care.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.959
We need more education,
not influence.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.921
Mr. Sprague, you may not think you
need influence in Washington,

27:54.005 --> 27:57.424
but I'm telling you, to have direct
access to members of Congress...

27:57.509 --> 28:00.886
is gonna influence how
they vote on the very...

28:01.888 --> 28:03.555
Oh. Speak of the devil.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.808
It's the congressional
offices calling.

28:05.892 --> 28:07.810
It's, uh, House majority
leader Tom DeLay.

28:07.894 --> 28:10.104
Excuse me for a
moment, everyone.

28:10.188 --> 28:13.857
Tom, how's it going?
Jack, am I on time?

28:13.942 --> 28:17.361
Everything is terrific here.
In fact, I'm with the Chippewa now.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.905
Remind me not to order the
tuna from the cafeteria again.

28:19.989 --> 28:23.992
Yes. I will, uh, remind them of
what they're up against, sir.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.580
Yeah. And absolutely that they
can count on your full support.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.208
Great, Jack. I'll see you.

28:32.961 --> 28:36.338
Great, Tom. Say hi to the president for me.
I'll call you when I get back.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.925
I'm not bragging...

28:40.009 --> 28:42.636
when I tell you that we can have
effective and direct access...

28:42.721 --> 28:45.472
to members of Congress on behalf
of Screaming Eagle Resort.

28:46.975 --> 28:50.269
Otherwise, this beautiful
casino that you have here...

28:50.353 --> 28:52.938
is gonna shut down tight
and very quickly.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.191
ln the current climate,

28:56.276 --> 28:58.736
we are barely breaking even now.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.155
I say the council votes no.

29:02.031 --> 29:03.782
Sorry, Mr. Abramoff.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.872
I'm going to have to agree.

29:09.956 --> 29:12.708
The council votes at 3:00 today, Mr.
Abramoff.

29:12.792 --> 29:14.752
But, uh,

29:14.836 --> 29:16.795
thanks for coming all this way.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.470
He's seriously messing with
the chi we had flowing.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.972
So Sprague is a subchief
on the council?

29:27.056 --> 29:30.350
It's an elected position.
Poncho has zero juice. Okay?

29:30.435 --> 29:32.478
What the hell is a
ceremonial chief anyway?

29:32.562 --> 29:35.272
Why didn't we know this before we wasted
a hundred grand taking him golfing?

29:35.356 --> 29:39.359
How the hell was I supposed to know
Poncho was the fucking queen of England?

29:42.197 --> 29:44.031
Well, Sprague's gotta go.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.283
When's the next
council election?

29:46.367 --> 29:48.827
You're not talking about messing
with the council election, are you?

29:48.912 --> 29:52.331
Because, you know, you're gonna be in
contravention of the Indian Act of 1968, mister.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.958
Well, let me tell you something.
They're fucking with our bread and butter, Mikey.

29:55.043 --> 29:58.670
I was gonna use that money as the down payment
on the SunSail opportunity with the Greek.

29:58.755 --> 30:01.882
Tell me about it. I just put a huge down
payment on this new house I'm buying.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.635
- What?
- The Du Pont mansion in Rehoboth Beach.

30:04.719 --> 30:06.428
I told you about it.
It's badass.

30:06.513 --> 30:09.473
And I've got a lease on a suite at the
Ritz-Carlton with this killer pool table.

30:09.557 --> 30:11.433
My overhead is insane right now.

30:11.518 --> 30:15.979
You haven't paid off your student loans.
What do you need with a mansion and a pool table?

30:16.064 --> 30:17.981
What? You're buying stuff.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.525
Worthwhile stuff.

30:19.609 --> 30:23.195
All right. Look. Just have Grover
keep Poncho entertained...

30:23.279 --> 30:26.907
and let him tell us mega-fast
when the next election is.

30:26.991 --> 30:30.577
Hey. I was in Florida 2000, dude.
Hanging chads, state troopers.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.913
This is gonna be a cakewalk.
All right?

30:32.997 --> 30:35.249
Tiptoe through the tulips.

30:37.126 --> 30:38.627
Hi there.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.924
Thank you.

30:48.471 --> 30:52.266
Be careful there, Mikey. She probably still
eats her Girl Scout cookies with milk.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.942
Thank you.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.863
Hey, baby doll.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.447
Hi. Whoo!

31:08.533 --> 31:10.450
Who the hell was that girl?

31:10.535 --> 31:12.661
You are so cute.

31:12.745 --> 31:16.039
She's an employee.
You gotta be nice to the help.

31:28.803 --> 31:31.430
For a Jew, I bet you get a
lot of cool Christmas cards.

31:31.514 --> 31:33.557
Oh, we see our share
of Nativity scenes.

31:33.641 --> 31:35.726
Hey. Look at you. Macho man.

31:35.810 --> 31:38.186
Oh, you didn't know I was a
guard at Beverly Hills High?

31:38.271 --> 31:41.189
Once knocked a kid ice-cold out from Inglewood.
Made the papers.

31:41.274 --> 31:44.860
I bet a lot of guys from Beverly
Hills went to the NFL, huh?

31:44.944 --> 31:47.988
Know what I majored in
in high school? Pool?

31:48.072 --> 31:50.115
No. Fuckin'.

31:50.199 --> 31:52.576
Really? How does it feel to
get a "C" in that class?

31:54.537 --> 31:58.457
All right. So you've gone from pool to selling mattresses?
That's quite an upgrade, Adam.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.834
I'm a very successful
mattress businessman.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.587
Really? 'Cause I hear
Kwikee-Mattress is in Chapter 11.

32:03.671 --> 32:07.966
Hey. I sold my franchise for
over seven figures and got out.

32:08.051 --> 32:11.428
Excellent. Because I've got a
new fantastic offer for you.

32:11.512 --> 32:13.221
Like what?

32:13.306 --> 32:15.432
SunSail Casinos.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.602
Offshore gambling?

32:18.686 --> 32:21.521
You know who you're dealing with?
Greenpeace?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.652
Trust me. I know.

32:26.736 --> 32:29.821
Adam, think of the fund-raising
possibilities, all right?

32:29.906 --> 32:32.866
It's like Vegas on crack.
The boats go out beyond the 12-mile limit.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.868
It's an all-cash business.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.329
Use your imagination, Adam.
'Cause I got plans.

32:37.413 --> 32:39.331
Yeah. Plans like Bugsy Malone.

32:39.415 --> 32:42.292
No. Plans like to open up my
own private Hebrew school.

32:42.377 --> 32:45.545
Public education sucks. You have no idea
what my kids have to deal with these days.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.673
Your own school? Yeah.

32:47.757 --> 32:49.800
Plus there's my foundation.
All the charity work I'm doing.

32:49.884 --> 32:53.220
Look. I'm trying to do important
stuff that matters for people.

32:54.555 --> 32:56.974
I...

32:57.058 --> 32:58.976
I...I don't know, Jack.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.979
I'm starting to see Charlie Manson as
my roommate for the next 10 years.

33:02.063 --> 33:05.440
This isn't a bunch of native people.
You're dealing with sharks here.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.901
I'm gonna say no.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.278
But thanks for the $65 steak.
It's delicious.

33:10.363 --> 33:13.657
Adam, just go down to Florida with my
business partner, Michael Scanlon,

33:13.741 --> 33:16.493
and you guys talk to
this Gus Boulis fellow.

33:16.577 --> 33:19.454
You're always asking me to give you something.
"Give me something. Give me something."

33:19.539 --> 33:21.289
Well, now I'm giving you
something, you schmuck.

33:21.374 --> 33:24.793
I was thinking something maybe a
little less hazardous to my person.

33:24.877 --> 33:27.504
I dealt with commies in Nicaragua,
generals in Pakistan.

33:27.588 --> 33:29.756
I've even dealt with
fucking Imelda Marcos.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.134
Why should I be afraid of a
Greek who makes sandwiches?

33:34.053 --> 33:35.762
What's Imelda like?

33:38.016 --> 33:40.225
She likes to play the piano
and sing show tunes.

33:40.309 --> 33:41.643
Really?

33:41.728 --> 33:44.229
Yeah. She's got a
pretty decent voice.

34:07.920 --> 34:11.422
Has all the subtlety
of a Thai whorehouse.

34:11.507 --> 34:13.632
Not that you would know what a
Thai whorehouse looks like, right?

34:15.803 --> 34:18.638
Looks like Boulis is
into family values.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.099
Looks like he hired
his whole family.

34:21.184 --> 34:24.478
Hey, guys.
I'm Chris, Gus's nephew.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.480
Gus is running a little late.

34:26.563 --> 34:29.065
You guys hungry?
You want something to drink?

34:29.150 --> 34:33.152
No, we're fine. I'll have a shot
of Cuervo and two Heinekens.

34:46.833 --> 34:50.295
I told Jack to forget about this place.
It's a fucking reptile cage.

34:50.379 --> 34:53.047
Boulis is doing mega
business here, dude.

34:56.344 --> 35:00.097
This blows. Whatever.
He's just trying to make a statement.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.849
This is how he operates?
We've been waiting an hour.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.727
I don't like it. I'm going back to Miami.
This is nuts. Whoa, whoa.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.938
Hang on. Adam, sit down.

35:08.022 --> 35:10.440
Sit down, okay?
Konstantinos Boulis.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.151
- Sorry to keep you.
- Hey. Mike Scanlon. Pleasure to meet you.

35:13.236 --> 35:14.736
Adam Kidan.

35:14.821 --> 35:18.657
Sorry Jack couldn't be here.
He sends his regards.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.953
You've done well for yourself, Gus.
Nice fleet of boats like this,

35:23.037 --> 35:24.704
dude, you gotta
be a content man.

35:24.789 --> 35:27.666
Yeah. Except for the
fuckin' attorney general.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.502
Because of him, I need to keep
what's left of my sanity.

35:32.171 --> 35:34.131
So, let's cut the crap.

35:35.049 --> 35:36.967
You and Jack plan
to pay my price?

35:37.051 --> 35:38.969
All right. Look.

35:39.053 --> 35:40.846
We can give you 20
cents on the dollar.

35:40.930 --> 35:43.306
That's the best we
can offer, dude.

35:43.391 --> 35:46.017
There's no negotiation.
You pay my price. That's it.

35:46.102 --> 35:50.063
Oh, yes. I keep a 10% interest.
I run the business.

35:51.107 --> 35:52.858
And don't call me "dude."

35:56.654 --> 35:59.197
You talkin' to me? Ah?

35:59.282 --> 36:01.074
Are you talkin' to me?

36:01.159 --> 36:03.410
Ah, it's your move. What the fu...

36:03.494 --> 36:05.996
You make the move. Huh?

36:06.080 --> 36:09.416
Sorry. Jack and his boys
watch too many movies.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.627
Movies? I didn't invite you
here to listen to comedians.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.921
- No, no. No. I was-
- What? You joke with me? Movies?

36:15.006 --> 36:16.464
Fairy tales? Get out!
Whoa, whoa.

36:16.549 --> 36:17.757
Fellas. Hey, hey.
You come back...

36:17.842 --> 36:19.551
when you can show my uncle
some respect, okay?

36:19.635 --> 36:21.344
No. I was just trying
to lighten the mood.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.180
Christos.

36:24.515 --> 36:27.350
Come on. Who doesn't
like impressions, right?

36:28.811 --> 36:30.896
What the fuck?

36:33.649 --> 36:36.193
Well, that went well.

36:36.277 --> 36:39.696
Fuckin' idiot.
Who doesn't negotiate?

36:39.780 --> 36:41.865
I know. I'm telling you.
He's a hard-ass, dude.

36:41.949 --> 36:45.702
You watch me put some hot sauce
in this fucker's tabbouleh.

36:45.786 --> 36:49.456
He's not gonna scare easy. I don't know how
the hell you're gonna get him to negotiate.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.250
Yeah. Well, you know what?
Try the Congress of the United States.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.377
Boulis will turn around, Mikey.
Trust me.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.880
- Hang on. Bob?
- Yeah, Jack.

36:56.964 --> 36:59.883
- Listen. I need a favor for a client.
- Sure. Name it.

36:59.967 --> 37:03.053
- Which tribe are we talking about?
- No. Not Indians. Greeks.

37:03.137 --> 37:05.138
Casino gambling
in South Florida.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.475
I represent the 18th
District of Ohio, Jack.

37:08.559 --> 37:11.394
It's a bit of a hot potato.
Can you deal me a pass on this one?

37:11.479 --> 37:15.065
After the money I've funneled to you this
year, Bob, no, I don't think you get a pass.

37:15.149 --> 37:18.610
All right? I need your help. I need it now.
Mike will send you the details.

37:18.694 --> 37:20.445
Thanks.

37:23.449 --> 37:24.991
So, here's the casino file.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.744
Jack expects to see you on
C-SPAN no later than Thursday.

37:27.828 --> 37:29.746
Tell him he's pushing it.

37:29.830 --> 37:32.123
Bob, he knows how busy you are
with the upcoming fall elections.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.959
ln fact, if I'm not mistaken,

37:34.043 --> 37:37.003
he's organizing a huge fund-raiser
for you next Tuesday.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.507
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

37:40.591 --> 37:43.385
I am an ardent supporter
of consumer rights.

37:43.469 --> 37:45.387
At the heart of my
comments today...

37:45.471 --> 37:48.139
is how certain gaming companies
treat their patrons.

37:48.224 --> 37:51.726
There are a few bad apples out there
who don't play by the rules...

37:51.811 --> 37:55.689
and who must be, uh,
weeded... weeded out.

37:55.773 --> 37:59.317
One such example is the
case of SunSail Casinos...

37:59.402 --> 38:01.111
and its proprietor, Gus Boulis.

38:01.195 --> 38:02.988
Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!

38:03.072 --> 38:05.073
You is the man. You is the man!

38:06.867 --> 38:08.576
What's all the
noise about, kids?

38:08.661 --> 38:12.080
Oh, hey, Manny. We're just working
hard finding a buyer for your client.

38:12.164 --> 38:14.332
Hey. Good. Glad to hear it.
Any live ones?

38:14.417 --> 38:16.334
Oh, yeah.
We're all over it, Manny.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.795
No shady ones from
the Marianas, okay?

38:18.879 --> 38:21.047
Absolutely.

38:22.091 --> 38:24.718
I serve this country
and no other.

38:31.726 --> 38:35.145
Listen. We need to get everything
we can on this Boulis, all right?

38:35.229 --> 38:37.272
I want you to call our
friends at Fox News...

38:37.356 --> 38:39.774
- and have DeLay hammer Jeb Bush down in Florida.
- Okay.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.860
No. Never mind.
I'll call DeLay myself.

38:41.944 --> 38:44.279
He wants me to hook him up with
the Harvard College Republicans.

38:44.363 --> 38:47.324
Thinks I can make him look good in
front of all those Ivy League monkeys.

38:47.408 --> 38:49.034
Yeah. Good luck with that.
You know what?

38:49.118 --> 38:51.328
He was a pest exterminator
in Laredo, Texas, dude.

38:51.412 --> 38:53.330
That's gonna be a huge
challenge in Cambridge.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.583
Hey, man. He clawed his way up to majority leader.
Now he's got his eyes on the White House.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.294
DeLay? Are we talking
about the same guy here?

38:59.378 --> 39:03.465
He was an alcoholic with famous hot
tub parties before he met God.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.429
What the hell, dude?

39:09.513 --> 39:12.015
What the hell was that?

39:12.099 --> 39:15.018
Never before has an individual...

39:15.102 --> 39:17.062
who's been steadfast
to our principles...

39:17.146 --> 39:20.523
risen as high as House
majority leader Tom DeLay.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.567
Tom DeLay is the most effective...

39:22.651 --> 39:25.070
I would say he was the most
effective whip in the House,

39:25.154 --> 39:27.155
and I would say he's the most
effective majority leader,

39:27.239 --> 39:31.326
and thank God Tom DeLay is the majority
leader in the House of Representatives.

39:36.999 --> 39:39.542
And I would just like to
add one thing to that,

39:39.627 --> 39:42.879
because I'm sure we all want
to hear from Mr. DeLay.

39:42.963 --> 39:47.717
But Tom DeLay is who all of us
hope to be when we grow up.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.260
Tom.

39:53.808 --> 39:57.143
Thanks, Jack.
You truly are my dearest friend.

40:02.316 --> 40:05.402
Senator Jarvis, I have a check for
you from the Choctaw Indians.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.278
Oh.
Press my "easy button," Jack.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.280
And they want to wish you the
best with your campaign.

40:09.365 --> 40:11.658
I want to, uh, congratulate
and thank each of you...

40:11.742 --> 40:15.078
for getting involved in politics
through Young Republicans.

40:15.162 --> 40:17.914
What you're doing is commendable
and important because,

40:17.998 --> 40:21.292
as goes politics, so
goes our country.

40:21.377 --> 40:24.587
Grover. And a weak country
cannot provide the world...

40:24.672 --> 40:26.589
Glad you're on the team.

40:27.883 --> 40:31.553
Jack, you know how I
feel about freebies.

40:31.637 --> 40:35.557
Poncho is the third Indian you've
made me babysit this month.

40:35.641 --> 40:38.643
There is only so much congressmen
at Americans for Tax Reform...

40:38.727 --> 40:42.063
want to be educated about the
benefits of Indian gaming.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.232
Grover.

40:46.193 --> 40:49.279
Well, Grover, how about we fatten
Poncho's donation to A.T.R.,

40:49.363 --> 40:51.281
help you out with your
operational costs?

40:51.365 --> 40:55.118
That'd be a start.
I have a hole in my budget of 75K.

40:55.202 --> 40:57.370
Ouch. All right.
I'll look into it, champ.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.747
Meanwhile, where the
fuck is your evil elf?

40:59.832 --> 41:03.918
Mikey boy? He was supposed to take
Poncho off my hands three hours ago.

41:11.051 --> 41:14.137
You guys want to see
something crazy? Bam!

41:14.221 --> 41:17.015
A million smackeroos, baby.
Give me five.

41:17.099 --> 41:20.101
How sexy am I to you
right now, huh?

41:20.186 --> 41:21.811
Very sexy. Right?

41:21.896 --> 41:24.898
- Sure you're not a drug dealer or something, baby?
- Drug dealer, my ass.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.691
Oh. Your lackey's defending you.

41:26.775 --> 41:29.444
Jack and I are doing
God's work, baby.

41:29.528 --> 41:31.488
And you don't think the
Indian Affairs Committee...

41:31.572 --> 41:34.032
is gonna take issue with all the
high fees you've been charging?

41:34.116 --> 41:36.618
Since when have you become
an expert on Indian affairs?

41:36.702 --> 41:39.162
You're not the only one who knows a thing
or two about Washington, you know.

41:39.246 --> 41:42.749
Those bitches are doing the exact same
thing we are... trying to open casinos.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.751
They're just jealous...

41:44.835 --> 41:47.295
'cause they don't
make as much as you.

41:47.379 --> 41:49.088
You are so right.

41:55.679 --> 41:58.097
Here it is, baby.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.725
Shangri-la, Kubla Khan, Xanadu.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.442
Ooh. Hey. Sorry, babe.

42:10.819 --> 42:13.154
Ah? Oh, my God.

42:13.239 --> 42:16.658
What? You don't like?
This is high-end?

42:16.742 --> 42:18.660
This is like something you'd
find in Southampton, right?

42:18.744 --> 42:20.912
Southampton.
Have you ever been to Southampton?

42:20.996 --> 42:22.914
This is great for
Delaware, dude.

42:22.998 --> 42:25.375
Right? A little bit of
paint here and there.

42:25.459 --> 42:27.460
Come on.
Mike, have you lost your mind?

42:27.545 --> 42:29.963
It's a what?

42:30.047 --> 42:32.715
A Zamboni.

42:32.800 --> 42:36.052
A Zamboni machine for smoothing
out the surface of the ice.

42:36.136 --> 42:37.679
What ice?

42:37.763 --> 42:40.265
The ice for the hockey rink.
A hockey rink?

42:40.349 --> 42:42.392
I don't see a hockey rink.
Well, no. Not here.

42:42.476 --> 42:44.561
It's being built somewhere else.
Honey.

42:44.645 --> 42:46.604
Look. These are all
temporary facilities.

42:46.689 --> 42:50.066
It's all part of the new Eshkol
Academy and Sports Center...

42:50.150 --> 42:52.318
that I'm building for all
these kids... for our kids.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.320
You were serious about
building a school?

42:54.405 --> 42:57.782
Well, of course. You know how I feel about
the education that these kids are getting.

42:57.866 --> 42:59.367
A hockey rink?

42:59.451 --> 43:00.910
Baby, I thought you'd be happy.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.871
I just bought us the biggest
house in the whole damn state.

43:03.956 --> 43:05.707
It's astonishing, dude. Right?

43:05.791 --> 43:07.584
For the Addams Family maybe.

43:09.086 --> 43:11.421
4.5 million?

43:11.505 --> 43:14.549
I can't even believe that you
would pay money for this...

43:14.633 --> 43:16.551
this dump.

43:16.635 --> 43:19.887
Are you kidding me? This place could be
like the Playboy Mansion or something, huh?

43:19.972 --> 43:22.056
It's all part of the
bigger picture, Pam.

43:22.141 --> 43:25.935
Philanthropy. The academy,
the library, my foundation.

43:26.020 --> 43:29.439
The restaurants, the boats, the
hotel... it's all gonna pay for it.

43:29.523 --> 43:31.357
Hotel? Yeah.
I'm looking at a property right now.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.401
The Chitimachas want
to invest with me.

43:33.485 --> 43:36.029
Jack, what are you doing?

43:36.113 --> 43:38.573
Is this why we aren't keeping
up with our house payments?

43:38.657 --> 43:41.784
Honey, think what you want about me, but
this is for our kids and their kids.

43:41.869 --> 43:45.079
They're our priorities here.
Is this even aboveboard?

43:45.164 --> 43:48.333
Joseph Kennedy built up his
entire business empire...

43:48.417 --> 43:50.001
with the help of
the Chicago mob.

43:50.085 --> 43:51.961
Jack, honey, I love you,

43:52.046 --> 43:55.340
and don't take this the wrong way,
but you are completely insane.

43:58.177 --> 44:01.638
Dude, we're gonna rip this crap
out, throw in a sound system.

44:01.722 --> 44:03.890
They will hear us
for miles, right?

44:03.974 --> 44:06.184
A sound system?

44:06.268 --> 44:08.645
What about furniture?
Knock yourself out, baby.

44:08.729 --> 44:10.396
Scanlon.

44:10.481 --> 44:11.981
Mike Scanlon? Yo.

44:12.066 --> 44:14.317
Susan Schmidt with
the Washington Post.

44:19.782 --> 44:21.991
Hi.
What can I do for you, Susan?

44:22.076 --> 44:26.245
Well, I wanted to see if you would
comment on that new minimum wage bill...

44:26.330 --> 44:30.833
the Senate's about to pass with respect to
your textile clients in the Northern Marianas.

44:30.918 --> 44:34.796
Oh. You know, I... I... I don't believe
they have all the votes on that, so...

44:34.880 --> 44:37.298
I don't think that bill's
gonna make it, actually.

44:37.383 --> 44:40.635
Uh, I'm also curious about the
work Preston Gates does...

44:40.719 --> 44:43.429
on behalf of Native Americans.

44:43.514 --> 44:46.599
We're thinking of doing a
report on Indian gaming.

44:46.684 --> 44:49.102
Oh, yeah?
Well, good luck with that.

44:49.186 --> 44:51.479
That should bore your
readers to death.

44:52.564 --> 44:53.773
Really?

44:55.859 --> 44:57.777
Looks like your Mariana
Islands are fucked.

44:57.861 --> 45:01.197
Senate passed the bill.
Minimum wage is on the way.

45:01.281 --> 45:02.990
I'm fucked.

45:03.075 --> 45:05.493
Jack said he'd can me if we didn't
reach the end zone on this one.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.249
Well, I'd better man
up, go break the news.

45:11.333 --> 45:13.626
Try to do that again.

45:17.715 --> 45:19.215
Whoo! Whoo!

45:19.299 --> 45:21.217
Nice.

45:21.301 --> 45:23.594
What's wrong, Ring Ding?
Somebody die?

45:23.679 --> 45:25.179
You guys didn't watch.

45:25.264 --> 45:27.181
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

45:29.393 --> 45:31.602
The Senate passed the bill.
The Marianas are fucked.

45:31.687 --> 45:34.147
So, why the long face?
This is great.

45:34.231 --> 45:36.482
Okay. Ye...

45:36.567 --> 45:39.402
Look. Let me... Let me run it down for you, boy.
This is how it works:

45:39.486 --> 45:41.362
Do you have any idea
how much more money...

45:41.447 --> 45:43.948
our clients are gonna have to pay us
to get that bill killed in the House?

45:44.032 --> 45:47.160
ln fact, I'm gonna call them right now,
tell them they gotta double their retainer.

45:47.244 --> 45:48.494
Enid.

45:48.579 --> 45:52.039
Sorry to interrupt you
all so hard at work.

45:52.124 --> 45:54.167
Jack, I need you to see
me for dinner tonight.

45:54.251 --> 45:55.793
Okay.

46:06.847 --> 46:09.599
Here's your menus, gentlemen.
Enjoy your dinner.

46:10.684 --> 46:12.977
The sashimi toro
is excellent here.

46:13.061 --> 46:16.105
No kidding. Not as good as it's gonna
be at my new restaurant though.

46:16.190 --> 46:18.858
I just hired a
top-dollar Tokyo chef.

46:18.942 --> 46:20.693
Five stars.

46:22.613 --> 46:25.364
New restaurant, Tokyo
chef, five stars.

46:25.449 --> 46:27.992
- How you feeling, Jack?
- Perfect. Why do you ask?

46:28.076 --> 46:32.038
No reason, other than I think you may be
suffering from delusions of fuckin' grandeur.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.417
I'm gonna have to let you go.

46:37.586 --> 46:39.587
You violated the
firm's ethics policy.

46:39.671 --> 46:41.631
We asked you to help Gus
Boulis sell his business,

46:41.715 --> 46:44.759
not elbow your way in and
try to buy it yourself.

46:44.843 --> 46:48.137
Your client is difficult. Do you think any
buyer out there is gonna agree to his terms?

46:48.222 --> 46:50.681
- I'm trying to help you out.
- Help us out?

46:50.766 --> 46:52.683
Using Adam Kidan as a front man?

46:52.768 --> 46:55.186
He's a good guy.
He's a respectable businessman.

46:55.270 --> 46:58.856
He's bankrupt, he's been disbarred,
he's a mob-connected sleazeball.

46:58.941 --> 47:02.276
- He's told me he has a clean bill of health.
- Clean bill of health?

47:02.361 --> 47:04.779
I'd say he was a cheap,
fat whore with the clap.

47:04.863 --> 47:06.614
My God, his own
mother was whacked.

47:06.698 --> 47:08.908
What the hell are
you talking about?

47:08.992 --> 47:11.744
If you're doing business with
this guy, then so are we.

47:11.829 --> 47:14.539
You think I want my firm connected
with someone like that?

47:14.623 --> 47:17.458
And, Jack, you know
what's even worse?

47:17.543 --> 47:19.252
You lied to us.

47:21.171 --> 47:24.257
I need you to clean out your
office by the end of the month.

47:24.341 --> 47:27.552
You're done.
You don't think, do you, Manny?

47:28.929 --> 47:31.472
You never got me.
You never have, you never will.

47:31.557 --> 47:34.433
Am I missing some nuance here?

47:34.518 --> 47:36.644
Uh, yeah, I'd say you're
missing some nuance.

47:36.728 --> 47:39.647
You're missing a big
fucking nuance.

47:39.731 --> 47:42.441
The Wall Street Journal is coming out
with a piece called "The Superlobbyist."

47:42.526 --> 47:44.986
Do you know who that is? That's me.
I'm the superlobbyist!

47:45.070 --> 47:49.198
I get paid higher retainer fees than anybody
else in this town, and you goddamn well know it.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.200
And I'm gonna have a new
restaurant, five stars.

47:51.285 --> 47:53.119
Five goddamn stars.

47:56.665 --> 47:58.624
- Anything else?
- I love my kids.

47:58.709 --> 48:00.626
I work out every single day.

48:02.004 --> 48:04.046
You're gonna come out the
losing end of this one, Manny.

48:04.131 --> 48:06.841
You're gonna lose every single one
of those Indian tribes as clients.

48:06.925 --> 48:08.467
And you know what I'm gonna do?

48:08.552 --> 48:10.219
Tomorrow morning, I'm
gonna go outside,

48:10.304 --> 48:12.221
and when "K" Street finds
out that I'm available,

48:12.306 --> 48:15.933
there's gonna be five fuckin' law firms...
top-drawer... who are gonna be dying to hire me.

48:16.018 --> 48:18.853
They're gonna be jumping up and down like
little kids who need to go to the can.

48:18.937 --> 48:20.938
"Let's hire Jack Abramoff!"

48:24.151 --> 48:26.819
Then you should have no
reason to be unhappy.

48:28.447 --> 48:30.573
Absolutely.

48:50.052 --> 48:52.053
Nice piece.

48:52.137 --> 48:55.014
You playing cowboy now
with those Indians?

48:55.098 --> 48:56.891
You've kept me waiting.

48:56.975 --> 48:59.644
Wh...Why'd you get the shooter?

48:59.728 --> 49:01.604
You didn't tell me
about your disbarment.

49:01.688 --> 49:04.065
Not to mention your
fucking bankruptcy.

49:04.149 --> 49:06.943
Not to mention the fucking mobbed-up
connections in Saint Martin.

49:07.027 --> 49:10.821
Not to mention the fucking murder
of your own fucking mother!

49:10.906 --> 49:13.866
- Well, I was gonna tell you.
- When? 2020?

49:13.951 --> 49:16.577
You're a dangerous man, Adam.
That's why I've got the fucking gun.

49:17.579 --> 49:20.414
Okay! So go ahead! Shoot me!

49:20.499 --> 49:23.125
Get in my house. Get in my house.
You're a fuckin' menace.

49:23.210 --> 49:24.919
You know that?

49:26.421 --> 49:29.465
You ought to wear a sign around
your neck as a public service.

49:29.549 --> 49:32.218
"Beware.
Adam Kidan, Fucking Menace."

49:34.554 --> 49:38.474
Where's Pam? With the kids.
I sent her to see her folks.

49:38.558 --> 49:42.144
So you're the married dude, and I'm
like the hot, underage mistress?

49:48.110 --> 49:50.778
Jack, you gotta relax.

49:50.862 --> 49:53.239
Maybe even psychologize, okay?

49:53.323 --> 49:58.411
You gotta ask yourself,
what does Gus Boulis want?

49:58.495 --> 50:02.248
He wants to make millions of dollars and keep
his fucking business. That's what he wants.

50:02.332 --> 50:06.585
What Boulis wants is to keep his
company and sell it at the same time.

50:06.670 --> 50:09.046
He wants both.

50:09.131 --> 50:11.090
So how do we give him both?

50:17.514 --> 50:22.184
What if we quietly kick back Boulis's
10%, call it a consulting fee.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.895
How does that get us the missing
piece of finance? Adam, I'm already...

50:24.980 --> 50:27.773
Look. Jack, we're just a
few deal points away now.

50:27.858 --> 50:30.401
Boulis wants to keep his piece
of the business under the table.

50:30.485 --> 50:33.237
That's against the law.
He'll have to take our I.O.U.s.

50:33.321 --> 50:35.865
For 20 million?
That's a hell of a lot of I.O.U.s, Adam.

50:35.949 --> 50:38.034
No. You're gonna have to
find another way to pay him.

50:38.118 --> 50:41.454
Trust me to handle the formalities.
Sweetheart.

50:43.248 --> 50:47.793
Jack, the boats can be ours after the
weekend, and your money problems are over.

50:48.795 --> 50:50.921
Just keep it legal, okay?

50:51.006 --> 50:55.009
I have a better idea.
Why don't you show me your pussy?

50:57.262 --> 51:00.473
Okay. That's great, Jack.

51:12.986 --> 51:15.321
- Welcome to Greenberg.
- Okay. Down there.

51:15.405 --> 51:16.781
Whoo! All right.

51:16.865 --> 51:18.783
That's the one.

51:24.790 --> 51:28.501
- Now you're getting serious.
- Loving the feng shui in here, buddy.

51:28.585 --> 51:30.211
Here. One thing missing.

51:33.548 --> 51:35.049
Shit.

51:38.887 --> 51:41.680
Looking good, sir.
Looking very good.

51:42.307 --> 51:44.141
Yeah.

51:44.226 --> 51:47.436
Yeah, well, just hang on a sec.
Let me see if I can find him.

51:49.523 --> 51:52.691
Congressman. Listen. Yes, sir.
We need your vote.

51:52.776 --> 51:54.568
Tickets?

51:54.653 --> 51:57.154
Redskins, Sunday? Absolutely.
Not a problem.

51:58.490 --> 52:00.658
I've had the honor
to know Tom DeLay,

52:00.742 --> 52:02.743
the best majority
leader that, uh,

52:02.828 --> 52:05.913
we've had in Congress in the
history of the United States.

52:14.047 --> 52:17.758
All right, daddy-o.
How much if I drain this gonad left-handed?

52:17.843 --> 52:19.885
Oh. Come on.

52:19.970 --> 52:22.304
Twenty-five "K.
" You are a cheap whore.

52:22.389 --> 52:25.349
Come on. It's 50 at least. Look at it.
It's halfway across the tarmac.

52:25.433 --> 52:27.977
All right. Fifty "K.
" You'll never make it.

52:28.061 --> 52:30.104
All right. Here we go.

52:31.898 --> 52:34.733
Daddy needs a new pair of shoes.

52:37.237 --> 52:41.574
Booyah! Whoo! Fifty g's, G!

52:41.658 --> 52:44.493
- Oh, Mikey.
- What's the matter, brother?

52:44.578 --> 52:47.371
I'm hemorrhaging money like
Niagara Falls out of my ass.

52:47.455 --> 52:51.292
SunSail, the restaurant, the school...
they've all got me strapped.

52:51.376 --> 52:53.294
I'm bouncing checks
all over the place.

52:53.378 --> 52:55.629
And now I'm really out on a limb
with the second restaurant.

52:55.714 --> 52:57.590
What the hell do you need
with a second restaurant?

52:57.674 --> 52:59.758
- Well, one of them's gotta be kosher, right?
- Oh, come on.

52:59.843 --> 53:02.303
There isn't a decent kosher
restaurant anywhere near "K" Street.

53:02.387 --> 53:06.015
- So?
- We need more clients.

53:06.099 --> 53:09.226
You need to chill out, dude.

53:09.311 --> 53:13.564
I got a phone call this morning from
Chief Nokoaht of the Texas Kickapoo.

53:13.648 --> 53:16.275
Nokoaht of the Kickapoo?
You're kidding. We're golden, baby.

53:16.359 --> 53:18.444
He wants to meet with Bush
about oil drilling rights.

53:18.528 --> 53:22.448
I told him he wants to get her done, it's
gonna cost him a million-a-month retainer.

53:22.532 --> 53:24.325
Can you get that
in the end zone?

53:24.409 --> 53:27.870
He loves what we've done with the
Chippewa, baby. Oh, awesome!

53:27.954 --> 53:31.123
If that's true, man, you make
him show you the money fast!

53:31.208 --> 53:33.042
Show me the money! The money!

53:33.126 --> 53:34.585
Whoo!

53:34.669 --> 53:36.545
You do that.

53:36.630 --> 53:38.797
Give me five.
Keep it under the radar.

53:38.882 --> 53:43.636
Congressman, I was on the phone this
very day with the governor of Texas,

53:43.720 --> 53:45.846
who told me personally...

53:45.931 --> 53:47.640
that all of his
congressional districts...

53:47.724 --> 53:49.558
are gonna vote no on the bill.

53:49.643 --> 53:51.477
That is correct.

53:57.484 --> 54:00.361
Uh, Congressman, look.
My, uh... My mother's very ill.

54:00.445 --> 54:03.697
She's on the other line.
Could I call you back? Yes. Thank you, sir.

54:03.782 --> 54:05.491
We did it. We're in. We're in.

54:05.575 --> 54:07.243
We're in like Flynn.

54:07.327 --> 54:09.662
Look at that. Who's Vegas?
Who's Vegas?

54:09.746 --> 54:11.080
You did it, Jack.

54:11.164 --> 54:13.374
Vegas, baby!

54:13.458 --> 54:15.209
Glad to see you're
enjoying the new digs.

54:15.293 --> 54:17.127
You is the man, Oscar.

54:17.212 --> 54:19.463
Glad to have you at
Greenberg, Jack.

54:19.547 --> 54:22.841
Along with the Coushattas, the
Choctaw and the Chippewa.

54:22.926 --> 54:24.885
And don't forget
the Kickapoo too.

54:24.970 --> 54:27.805
Mikey, baby.

54:27.889 --> 54:32.184
Chippewa election central, dude,
in beautiful Saginaw, Michigan.

54:32.269 --> 54:34.520
Oh, man. ¿Qué pasa, "Mike-ito"?

54:34.604 --> 54:36.981
It is perfect timing,
because you know why?

54:37.065 --> 54:40.067
We just closed SunSail.
We own it.

54:40.151 --> 54:42.945
Oh-ho! Sweet!

54:43.029 --> 54:46.824
Dude! Our kwong is
so flowing, daddy-o!

54:46.908 --> 54:49.827
- How goes it down there with all the troglodytes?
- The what?

54:49.911 --> 54:51.328
Troglodyte.

54:51.413 --> 54:54.206
It's... Fuckin' look it up.
What am I, a dictionary?

54:54.291 --> 54:58.085
Dude, listen, listen.
The slate of eight rocked it today. We're in.

54:58.169 --> 55:00.504
Wh...What are you saying?
We won? We did it.

55:00.588 --> 55:03.173
We did it.
Bernie Sprague is out, Poncho is in.

55:03.258 --> 55:07.303
Consider us hired by the Chippewa, dude.
You are gold, you dog!

55:07.387 --> 55:08.929
When it rains, it pours!

55:09.014 --> 55:11.015
All right. We gotta start
talking about billing figures.

55:11.099 --> 55:13.809
I want 20 million from
these monkeys right away.

55:13.893 --> 55:15.811
Yes, Big Chief Rainmaker.

55:15.895 --> 55:19.815
Oh, dude, you have to know Sprague is
super pissed about this whole deal. Okay?

55:19.899 --> 55:22.818
- He took it really hard.
- Oh, yeah. What is that job he's got?

55:22.902 --> 55:24.653
Uh, parks and recreation
commissioner.

55:24.738 --> 55:27.197
Yeah, well, doesn't the
council control it?

55:27.282 --> 55:30.492
- Why don't you just tell Poncho to eliminate the position?
- You got it, man.

55:30.577 --> 55:33.620
Trim unnecessary fat from the budget,
fiscal discipline, yada, yada, yada.

55:33.705 --> 55:36.832
Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's bad
karma to kick a guy when he's down.

55:36.916 --> 55:38.959
Uh, yeah, right.

55:39.044 --> 55:41.962
Not only are we gonna kick him when he's down,
we're gonna kick him till he passes out.

55:42.047 --> 55:45.215
Then we're gonna beat him over the head with a
baseball bat, roll him up into an old rug...

55:45.300 --> 55:48.093
and kick him off a cliff into
the pounding surf below.

55:51.056 --> 55:53.265
Go take a jog, buddy.

55:58.938 --> 56:01.065
Mr. Abramoff's office.

56:02.192 --> 56:03.776
Yeah, run and get Jack.

56:03.860 --> 56:06.070
Excuse me. Who's calling?

56:06.154 --> 56:08.072
Bernie. Bernie.

56:08.156 --> 56:10.240
Bernie who?

56:10.325 --> 56:13.327
Tell him I'm a rabbi on
the synagogue board.

56:14.621 --> 56:16.997
Uh, Mr. Abramoff's in a meeting.

56:17.082 --> 56:19.416
Uh, can he return?

56:19.501 --> 56:22.419
Tell him he's gonna
have company soon.

56:22.504 --> 56:24.171
Excuse me. Who is this?

56:33.181 --> 56:35.015
Black 22. Black 22.

56:42.107 --> 56:45.067
Are all these bastards
related to Gus?

56:45.151 --> 56:48.112
How do you mean? There's enough staff
in here to run an aircraft carrier.

56:48.196 --> 56:50.614
They're all family. Really?

56:50.698 --> 56:53.200
This isn't the old country.
We're in America.

56:53.284 --> 56:55.661
Wait in my cabin.

57:08.466 --> 57:10.175
Here it is.

57:15.014 --> 57:17.349
This is just today's take? Yep.

57:17.434 --> 57:19.351
Ka-ching.

57:19.436 --> 57:22.980
? Over the valley
voices are singing ?

57:23.064 --> 57:25.983
? Bells are a-ringing
Dance, everyone, dance ?

57:26.067 --> 57:29.069
? Come to the valley Run
through the clover ?

57:29.154 --> 57:32.364
? Harvest is over Dance,
everyone, dance ?

57:32.449 --> 57:34.783
- ? Dance where the corn is high ?
- More corned beef.

57:34.868 --> 57:37.953
We want to make sure all our kosher friends
in Washington are well taken care of.

57:38.037 --> 57:40.956
And they will be here. Right?

57:41.040 --> 57:43.834
? Join hands, skip along
Dance, everyone, dance ?

57:43.918 --> 57:47.212
? Turn left, turn
right Hold tight ?

57:47.297 --> 57:49.173
? Lift your feet The
heart will follow ?

57:49.257 --> 57:52.551
Pam, honey, I promise, only
two restaurants. Oh, Jack.

57:52.635 --> 57:54.303
? Spread your wings
like the swallow ?

57:54.387 --> 57:55.929
? Fly away ?

57:56.014 --> 57:58.140
? Greet the day ?

57:58.224 --> 58:00.434
? Dance, dance
Everybody dance ??

58:04.647 --> 58:06.815
Mike. Mike!

58:06.900 --> 58:09.234
Why is Susan Schmidt
trying to reach you?

58:09.319 --> 58:12.446
She just left a message for you
on my cell phone. Ignore her.

58:12.530 --> 58:15.157
She's a nosy reporter
from the Post.

58:15.241 --> 58:16.992
You know Susan's a friend.

58:17.076 --> 58:20.078
Babe, I don't care how many white
wine spritzers you drink with her.

58:20.163 --> 58:22.998
This is business, so fuck her.
I'm not calling her back.

58:23.082 --> 58:26.418
Did you see the electrician up there?
He said he would be here at 4:00.

58:26.503 --> 58:28.295
What do I look like, the help?

58:29.839 --> 58:32.090
You're so useless.
Where the hell do you think you're going?

58:32.175 --> 58:34.593
I'm pretty sure I told you I
have a business meeting, hon.

58:34.677 --> 58:36.136
A business meeting.

58:36.221 --> 58:39.139
What, in your flip-flops?
How dumb do you think I am?

58:39.224 --> 58:41.141
What? I have business
to discuss with Brian.

58:41.226 --> 58:43.143
You have business with Brian?

58:43.228 --> 58:46.230
I love you, but you're getting kinda nuts.
You know that?

58:46.314 --> 58:48.899
I gotta send Brian to Michigan to
help out with the Chippewa deal.

58:48.983 --> 58:52.486
And what part of your dubious dealings
with the Chippewa is Brian a party to?

58:52.570 --> 58:54.988
Baby, Brian is helping us
fight the good fight, okay?

58:55.073 --> 58:58.617
Oh, God, why do l waste my time here
with you and these Delaware weenies?

58:58.701 --> 59:01.828
Yeah, because you'd rather be at some gay
elitist dinner party in Georgetown, right?

59:02.622 --> 59:04.915
- You bet I would.
- Later.

59:04.999 --> 59:06.500
Mike!

59:12.090 --> 59:14.508
Forty-two hundred square feet?

59:14.592 --> 59:17.302
Isn't that just overdoing
it a little bit, Adam?

59:17.387 --> 59:19.096
Hey, how big is your place?

59:19.180 --> 59:22.766
- Yeah, well, I got a family of seven.
- Well, I got people too.

59:22.850 --> 59:25.936
It's a real beauty deal here.
Why shouldn't I have a few perks?

59:26.020 --> 59:29.273
Just try to use a modicum of self-control.
Is that possible?

59:29.357 --> 59:32.568
This isn't exactly Manhattan.
I'm dying of boredom here.

59:32.652 --> 59:35.070
Yeah. Adam, listen to me.
I just spoke to the money people.

59:35.154 --> 59:37.531
The last financials you sent over
don't make any goddamn sense.

59:37.615 --> 59:40.617
I think that's maybe my pizza.

59:40.702 --> 59:42.619
Adam.

59:44.163 --> 59:46.957
I kick your ass, okay?

59:47.041 --> 59:48.959
I'm gonna have to call you back.

59:49.043 --> 59:50.961
Adam, don't hang...

59:51.045 --> 59:53.380
No, go. Go, go, go.

59:53.464 --> 59:55.924
Hey, hey.
See you back at the boat.

59:56.009 --> 59:57.509
Bye.

59:58.511 --> 01:00:00.012
Oh. Oh.

01:00:04.892 --> 01:00:07.311
Twelve people here...
Tanya, Nick, Dimitri.

01:00:07.395 --> 01:00:09.605
I'm not the welfare
department, okay?

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:12.190
Finding your relatives
new jobs is not my gig.

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:16.778
My family... they all move here
to Florida because of me.

01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:19.281
What happens to them now?
They starve?

01:00:19.365 --> 01:00:22.242
You know what? I'm really not having as
much fun here as it might look like.

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:25.329
Okay? And I don't need your
family around skimming the take.

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:27.080
Listen to me, you
dumb Jew bastard!

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:31.543
That wire transfer was a phony!

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:35.380
My nephew, my sister-in-law, all of them,
they all go back on the payroll tomorrow!

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:38.050
Now, you listen to me!
You're out, Gus!

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:40.636
You don't like it, sue me!
I'm not gonna sue you!

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.387
I'm gonna kill you!

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:47.309
Since my previous statement, I have
come to learn that SunSail Casinos...

01:00:47.393 --> 01:00:50.479
now finds itself
under new ownership.

01:00:50.563 --> 01:00:54.608
The new owner has a reputation
for honesty and integrity.

01:00:57.445 --> 01:00:59.821
Adam Kidan is most well known...

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:03.283
for his successful
enterprise, Kwikee-Mattress.

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:07.496
But he also well known as a
respected member of his community.

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.748
While Mr. Kidan certainly
has his hands full...

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:12.876
in his efforts to clean
up SunSail's reputation,

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.379
his track record in business
leads me to believe...

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:18.173
that he will easily
transform SunSail...

01:01:18.257 --> 01:01:19.966
from a questionable enterprise...

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:21.468
into an outstanding
establishment...

01:01:21.552 --> 01:01:25.931
that the ga... the, uh, gaming
community can be proud of.

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:29.643
- I can't hear you!
- Please stop.

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:32.479
Please...

01:01:32.563 --> 01:01:36.608
Please stop. Please.

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:40.153
Please stop.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.864
Please... stop.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:44.366
Please.

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:47.369
You have reached
the voice mail of...

01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:49.037
Mike Scanlon.

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:52.416
This mailbox is full.
Please try again later.

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:01.091
Is Mike in his room?
I haven't seen him this morning.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.260
Oh.

01:02:03.344 --> 01:02:06.388
I have some dry cleaning for him to pick up.
Oh, I'll take it.

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:10.809
Mike? Mike!

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:15.981
Mike?

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:44.259
Excuse me.
Does Abramoff know I'm here?

01:02:44.343 --> 01:02:47.304
Sir, I already told you Mr.
Abramoff is unavailable.

01:02:47.388 --> 01:02:50.515
So if I were you, I
wouldn't waste my time.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.017
Huh.

01:02:53.352 --> 01:02:55.854
Dude, seriously, I'm
worried about Emily.

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:58.315
She hasn't returned my
call since yesterday.

01:02:58.399 --> 01:03:00.650
Well, you sleep in the
bed you make, my friend.

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:03.111
Oh, thanks for the empathy.
I really appreciate it.

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:06.239
Yeah, well, listen.

01:03:06.324 --> 01:03:08.241
You can win anyone over.

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:09.785
Sensible people
always negotiate.

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:11.870
All you have to do is just
make Boulis sensible.

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:13.955
Oh, yeah? Great. Thanks, Jack.
You know what?

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.000
I'm sure he's gonna be thrilled
about the bogus wire transfer.

01:03:17.084 --> 01:03:20.378
I'm serious, Jack. What am I gonna say
about Kidan's phony wire transfer?

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:25.425
Gus, just let me personally
apologize for Adam Kidan.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.093
He is a social menace.

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:30.388
You gonna apologize for that
phony wire transfer too?

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:33.558
What... What... What
phony wire transfer?

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.813
Holy shit!

01:03:39.857 --> 01:03:42.359
Gus, that was
Kidan's department.

01:03:42.443 --> 01:03:44.236
Had nothing to do with us, okay?

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.447
There is nothing that I detest more
than the stench of lies, okay?

01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:51.535
He is a... is an errand boy sent by
grocery clerks to collect the bill.

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:54.371
Jack and I have your cash and I
can give it to you right now.

01:03:54.455 --> 01:03:57.290
You're all out of SunSail.
As far as I'm concerned, that's it.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.835
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Gus.
We're reasonable people here.

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:02.128
Let's... Let's... Let's... Talk
to my lawyers, all right?

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:05.841
Well, listen, Jack and l would like
to settle this without lawyers, okay?

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:07.342
How would that happen?

01:04:07.426 --> 01:04:10.345
Gus, our new clients, the
Chippewa tribe of Michigan,

01:04:10.429 --> 01:04:13.557
just made me the highest paid
lobbyist in our nation's history.

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:16.184
Okay? You know why?
Because we help them, Gus.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:19.563
And they help us, and we help you.
You help us, you help them, they help you.

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:21.565
That's how it works.
Help who? What?

01:04:21.649 --> 01:04:25.819
Listen, the bottom line is we have
serious financial liquidity now,

01:04:25.903 --> 01:04:28.530
and we want the opportunity
to prove to you, Gus,

01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:32.158
that we can take your 11 boats and turn
them into a fleet of 30 around the world.

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:34.077
Okay?
We're talking about tripling,

01:04:34.161 --> 01:04:37.038
possibly even quadrupling
our income in six months.

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:39.749
A floating casino
empire here, dude.

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:42.627
And we want you to be
a major part of that.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.379
All right.
We can make this happen.

01:04:44.463 --> 01:04:45.964
I don't want Kidan.

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:49.175
He's a disgusting, fat asshole.
The man groped me in front of Gus.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.928
So Kidan just disappeared
from SunSail.

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:55.056
- How?
- Jack works him like a monkey on a stick.

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:57.142
All right?
You let us handle that.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:05:00.186
Your pen face makes
me want to puke!

01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:03.899
This is the second time I've been
a victim of family violence.

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:06.359
I had to hire a gorilla...

01:05:06.444 --> 01:05:09.571
Oh. Oh. No offense. None taken.

01:05:09.655 --> 01:05:11.031
I got a court order.

01:05:11.115 --> 01:05:13.867
Gus Boulis can't
come near the boats.

01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:17.037
I've rented an armor-plated
car 'cause of that psychotic.

01:05:17.121 --> 01:05:21.458
Did you ever think that he might be mad at you
for giving him a check for $23 million...

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:23.209
that's absolutely
fucking worthless?

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:25.879
I'm talking about
my physical safety!

01:05:25.963 --> 01:05:28.757
His people are moving our
slots off our boats!

01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:31.593
He's capable of all manner
of strong-arm shit!

01:05:31.677 --> 01:05:33.720
Well, just don't do
anything stupid.

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:38.350
Hey, I think you
broke something.

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:43.146
Well, Adam, we break
something, we fix it, right?

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:48.318
He is the all-time champ bastard
motherfucker of all time!

01:05:48.402 --> 01:05:53.490
And I think you'll agree it's time
Gus Boulis was gone from SunSail!

01:05:53.574 --> 01:05:55.784
- Ow!
- Let us go talk to him.

01:05:55.868 --> 01:05:59.245
I know how you talk to people.
You're as subtle as a fucking chain saw.

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:00.789
Look at you!

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:07.379
Go all right?

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:10.340
Couldn't even get
through the front door.

01:06:10.424 --> 01:06:13.551
Something interesting happened
with Walter over at the casino.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:16.638
- He did an annual audit.
- Oh, yeah?

01:06:16.722 --> 01:06:21.309
Nothing matched. The accountant said
that none of Abramoff's figures add up.

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:24.521
We're paying for hundreds of thousands
worth of lunches at his restaurant.

01:06:24.605 --> 01:06:28.191
$200,000 for his
Redskins skybox.

01:06:28.275 --> 01:06:31.653
But it's well known he helped other
tribes save billions of dollars in taxes.

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:38.743
And that so-called grassroots
campaign against the Jena?

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:42.247
lt was made up of three people handing
out a few dozen Kinko's flyers.

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:45.166
The guy took us for
a bunch of suckers.

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:48.211
Son of a bitch is no good.

01:06:48.295 --> 01:06:50.880
He's now preying on the
Kickapoo and the Choctaw.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:02.017
Look, you tell me it's about
taking care of things.

01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:05.103
So l...I'll even give you a
financial piece of the casino.

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:08.565
I just don't want to take any
more chances with this guy.

01:07:09.608 --> 01:07:10.942
I don't know, Adam.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.903
Tony, we're old friends.
Don't make me beg.

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:19.784
You know, I had an uncle
who was half-Jewish.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.120
He used to relax me.

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:23.872
Give me your hand.

01:07:23.956 --> 01:07:25.707
Give me your hand, palm up.

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:27.292
Palm up. He used to go...

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:34.549
Ow!

01:07:34.633 --> 01:07:36.217
Fuck.

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:40.055
He scared me and relaxed
me at the same time.

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:45.060
Anyway, from what you tell me,
this goof, this fucking Greek...

01:07:45.144 --> 01:07:46.936
deserves a broken leg at least.

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:49.731
No, no, no. Violence sickens me.

01:07:49.815 --> 01:07:52.025
I can hit him in
the fucking head.

01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:54.527
No! No! No shooting, please.

01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:58.198
Look, you'll come down
there and you'll be a...

01:07:59.867 --> 01:08:02.535
What?
The ship's catering director?

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.162
What do I know about cooking?

01:08:05.998 --> 01:08:08.917
So you'll learn to make gyros.
Can it be that difficult?

01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:11.544
- Gyros? What's a "gyros"?
- "Heroes."

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:16.256
Listen to me. I'm telling you now
like I would tell my own son.

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:19.803
I've been in this
business 50 years.

01:08:19.886 --> 01:08:21.805
The correct move...

01:08:22.973 --> 01:08:24.224
is to whack him.

01:08:24.308 --> 01:08:26.810
No. Tony, listen.

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:29.229
You should know there's
important people involved.

01:08:29.313 --> 01:08:33.108
Political people.
High up. Way high up.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:36.236
And there's a lot of money involved.
Hundreds of millions of dollars.

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:38.988
Everything is very,
very, very sensitive.

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:45.245
Okay. I got it covered.

01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:47.080
Got it covered.

01:08:47.163 --> 01:08:49.541
What about Abramoff?
Is he okay with this?

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:52.460
Jack? He'll never come down.
He's in D.C.

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:54.170
Besides, I got the guy baffled.

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:55.337
Okay.

01:08:55.421 --> 01:08:57.423
I need 40 grand right away.

01:08:57.508 --> 01:09:01.301
I just want you to make sure Gus Boulis never
attacks me again with a fucking ballpoint.

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:05.055
It's not funny.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.183
- A fucking pen.
- It's not funny.

01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:10.435
All right. Hey, listen.

01:09:12.606 --> 01:09:15.024
Why don't you go on a vacation?

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:19.654
Don't worry. I'll be nice.

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:34.502
Jack, the I.M.F.
is never going to allow the Russians in...

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:37.505
until Putin deals with
the human rights issues.

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.674
Come on. You don't think we
have influence in Moscow?

01:09:39.758 --> 01:09:42.510
I don't care! I'm sick and tired of waiting!
I've come from Michigan!

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:45.388
- I know the son of a bitch is back here someplace.
- Excuse me! Excuse me!

01:09:45.471 --> 01:09:47.599
- Get your hands off me!
- You cannot come in here!

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:49.600
You have no right to go
by reception like that!

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:53.520
Hey, let's talk about the 20 million you
took off my people, you and Scanlon.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:55.815
- Never mind hiding in
your goddamn office.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.693
- Yeah.
- Look, I came all the way from Michigan to talk to you!

01:09:58.777 --> 01:10:02.947
From today on, Jack, I'm
gonna make you my hobby.

01:10:04.116 --> 01:10:05.867
Who was that guy?

01:10:05.951 --> 01:10:09.287
Bad karma. Anyway, I know
people who know Putin.

01:10:17.004 --> 01:10:18.504
Ms. Miller?

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.841
I'm Agent Hanley.
Please, come in.

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:28.473
Uh, you have something you
wish to report? I do.

01:10:36.774 --> 01:10:39.317
Ms. Miller, is this
a federal issue?

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:42.987
You bet.

01:10:44.156 --> 01:10:46.074
It's a little
embarrassing, Jack.

01:10:46.158 --> 01:10:48.076
Look, he's a Jewish kid
from the West Bank...

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.079
who's tired of having ?amas lob
rockets into his neighborhood.

01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:53.081
He wanted to build a sniper
school, I helped him out.

01:10:53.165 --> 01:10:55.583
With a shipment of a thousand
night-vision goggles?

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:58.753
Okay. We make a lot of money, right?
Don't you think it's our obligation to help too?

01:10:58.837 --> 01:11:01.464
It's good karma.
You bought them from the Russians, Jack.

01:11:01.548 --> 01:11:03.591
I got a lot of good
contacts in Moscow now.

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:06.469
Jack, Newsweek is calling
you a Zionist thug.

01:11:06.553 --> 01:11:08.471
You got that Time
magazine article?

01:11:08.555 --> 01:11:12.141
The same week that Newsweek
calls me a Zionist thug,

01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:15.603
Time magazine accuses me of
supporting Islamic terrorism...

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:20.149
because I gave money to Grover to help
him mobilize Republican Muslims in Ohio.

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:22.402
The press are maniacs.
You know that.

01:11:22.486 --> 01:11:26.114
A lot of people are talking, Jack.
You're drawing too much attention to our profession.

01:11:26.198 --> 01:11:27.865
Bunch of wusses.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:31.953
Jack, this isn't the '90s anymore.
Look around. It's post 9/11.

01:11:32.037 --> 01:11:34.664
Bill Clinton isn't running around
boasting about budget surpluses...

01:11:34.748 --> 01:11:37.500
and drinking Krug out
of crystal flutes.

01:11:37.584 --> 01:11:40.295
Bill Clinton is the best thing
that ever happened to Washington,

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:42.213
and I say that as a Republican.

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:45.675
Let me spell it out for you.

01:11:47.094 --> 01:11:49.220
"K" Street doesn't like
the limelight, Jack.

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:53.933
The partners and l are
giving you a warning.

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:56.019
You're wrong on this.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:07.530
Susan Schmidt, Washington Post.

01:12:07.614 --> 01:12:09.824
Susan, Emily Miller.

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:12.243
I'd like to talk to you
about Mike Scanlon...

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.329
and the Chippewa Indians.

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:18.249
270 "P" Street, please.

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:39.062
Hey. Who the hell asked
you to sit down, pop?

01:12:39.146 --> 01:12:41.939
Mr. Boulis,

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.275
you don't return phone calls.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.944
Yeah, well, I work for a living.
I'm busy.

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:51.574
Well, I mean, you got a
nice operation here.

01:12:51.658 --> 01:12:54.327
But it's rude, see?

01:12:54.411 --> 01:12:56.996
Could I have a cracker?
I'm starving.

01:12:57.081 --> 01:13:00.041
Who the fuck are you, I
should return your calls?

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:02.877
I'm looking after Mr. Kidan now.

01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:06.672
His interests are my interests.
He's with me.

01:13:06.757 --> 01:13:08.925
Adam fuckin' Kidan
can suck my prick.

01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:13.388
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:16.474
And no goombah wop is
gonna waste my time.

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:19.143
Oh.

01:13:22.981 --> 01:13:27.652
Well, maybe I should explain to you
who I am before this goes too far.

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:30.571
I know who you are.

01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:32.990
You're the senior citizen
fucking Al Capone.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:36.119
I'll cut your fucking throat.
Okay, gramps?

01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:37.829
Oh, okay.

01:13:40.457 --> 01:13:42.667
All right, fine. I'll go.

01:13:45.712 --> 01:13:47.839
I don't bother you no more.

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:07.859
Listen, trust me, Chief.
Bernie Sprague is becoming a problem.

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:11.112
Yeah? Can you help me
out with this guy?

01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:13.489
Your guy Scallion
told me to fire him.

01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:17.243
Scanlon. Look, can you just
give him his job back?

01:14:17.327 --> 01:14:20.329
lt doesn't exist anymore.
Scanlon eliminated it.

01:14:20.414 --> 01:14:21.706
Right?

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:24.125
Well, look, you know, I can't...

01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:27.962
Musharraf. I've met Musharraf, okay?
Newt Gingrich knows my name.

01:14:28.046 --> 01:14:32.216
I don't need this guy. Can you just give
him some job and get him off my back?

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.885
Hey, Jack, guess what.

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:35.011
What?

01:14:35.095 --> 01:14:37.430
I got the new H2
in metallic red.

01:14:37.514 --> 01:14:40.558
It's fully loaded and it
is fucking beautiful!

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:42.560
Great. Hope you enjoy it.

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:44.061
Enid!

01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:46.564
There he is.

01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:50.109
He ain't such a tough
guy now, is he?

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:53.654
Gyro.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:56.574
You know, this oughta make that
fat Jew happy for a change.

01:14:56.658 --> 01:15:00.912
Forget Kidan. If he doesn't do what we
say with SunSail, it'll be him next.

01:15:11.715 --> 01:15:13.925
Go!

01:15:27.272 --> 01:15:30.399
Emily? Baby?

01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:33.027
Em?

01:15:33.111 --> 01:15:34.820
You here, baby?

01:15:40.744 --> 01:15:42.495
Baby.

01:15:48.001 --> 01:15:52.463
And over here we have a beautiful
portrait by Aaron Shikler...

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:56.342
of our 35th president,
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

01:15:56.426 --> 01:16:00.221
Adam, Adam, what are you talking about?
Are you nuts?

01:16:00.305 --> 01:16:02.807
You said you wanted Gus
Boulis gone from SunSail.

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:04.809
Five shots in the head.
Five shots in the head.

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:07.019
That's what you think I was
suggesting, you fucking moron?

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:10.231
Well, I asked him to be my
caterer, not whack the guy.

01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:13.401
Anyway, you were over a thousand miles away.
They can't connect us to it.

01:16:13.485 --> 01:16:15.027
Are you serious?

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:17.697
Do you have any idea that the grand
jury is sitting right now...

01:16:17.781 --> 01:16:19.323
discussing fraud on
the wire transfer?

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:22.994
God, why did I even get involved in SunSail?
What was I thinking?

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:24.287
Oy vey.

01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:26.414
So now we got blood
on our hands?

01:16:26.498 --> 01:16:30.126
Oh, no. No, no, no. They're not coming after me.
They're coming after you, Adam. You know why?

01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:33.838
Because I know those guys at Justice and
they jerk off thinking about guys like you.

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.340
My right hand to God, Jack,
I wish I'd never met you!

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:40.386
Fuck you! Fuck you, you
stupid, goddamn fatty!

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:42.179
What? You're the one who's fat!

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:45.141
You fat, fat, fake Jew fuck fat!

01:16:45.225 --> 01:16:48.477
Eat me, you goddamn
fat cocksucker!

01:16:49.329 --> 01:16:51.047
Sorry. Little issue on the Hill.

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:55.610
Presidential
portrait collection...

01:16:57.903 --> 01:16:58.589
What?

01:16:58.692 --> 01:17:01.823
Mr. Abramoff, Congressman DeLay
needs you to come to his office.

01:17:02.858 --> 01:17:04.548
Yes, well, if you'll tell Tom...

01:17:04.568 --> 01:17:08.595
that I'm currently in the White House about
to see the president of the United States.

01:17:08.615 --> 01:17:11.000
I have Chief Nokoaht of
the Kickapoo with me.

01:17:11.084 --> 01:17:13.479
Congressman DeLay says you should
drop whatever you're doing...

01:17:13.499 --> 01:17:15.277
and come to his
office immediately.

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:18.235
- The president will see you now.
- I have to call you back.

01:17:18.723 --> 01:17:20.268
Mr. President.

01:17:21.178 --> 01:17:24.889
How you doing there, buff guy?
Looks like you been working out.

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:27.248
Mike!
Mike, listen to me, all right?

01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:30.186
Why... Listen.
This could be very serious.

01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:32.772
Why is the Washington Post calling
DeLay about the Chippewa?

01:17:32.856 --> 01:17:36.275
His secretary says he's freaking out
about a story they're running tomorrow.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:39.487
Jack... me and Emily broke up.

01:17:39.571 --> 01:17:42.031
Oh, well, you know, buddy,
you got my condolences.

01:17:42.115 --> 01:17:44.283
But, you know, he's about
to rip my head off.

01:17:44.368 --> 01:17:47.703
No, no, no! Listen!
Emily found out about the stewardess Crystal.

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:49.914
But this could be serious, Mike.
Pay attention.

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:51.707
No, Jack, you're not listening!

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:54.126
She found Crystal's panties
in my dry cleaning,

01:17:54.211 --> 01:17:58.047
and she got super-fucking pissed
and went to the F.B.l., dude!

01:17:58.131 --> 01:18:01.258
She knew everything about "give me five," Jack.
She had no mercy!

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:05.054
You told Emily Miller
about "give me five"?

01:18:05.138 --> 01:18:07.390
How could you be
so fucking stupid?

01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:11.185
We were getting married!
She wanted us to share everything, Jack!

01:18:11.269 --> 01:18:14.355
You're married! You know what it's like!
Come on, man!

01:18:14.439 --> 01:18:17.775
Mike, what the fuck
were you thinking?

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:20.695
Hey! Hey! Hey!
I have my priorities too, man!

01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:23.906
You should have been thinking of me!
I'm your fucking priority!

01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:25.533
Oh, right! Right!

01:18:25.617 --> 01:18:29.495
So when I'm in the pen catching it
from some big black dude named Busta,

01:18:29.579 --> 01:18:31.872
I'll be thinking of
Jack fucking Abramoff!

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:36.210
We're fucked, dude!
It's totally over!

01:18:36.294 --> 01:18:39.422
Jack!

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.812
He's waiting for you.

01:18:59.025 --> 01:19:00.484
Hey, Tom.

01:19:02.028 --> 01:19:04.488
Come on in here, Jack.

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:09.869
My, uh, secretary told you about
how concerned I am about this, uh...

01:19:09.953 --> 01:19:12.872
this story coming out in
tomorrow's Washington Post.

01:19:12.956 --> 01:19:15.374
Look, they're probably gonna
bury it in the National section.

01:19:15.459 --> 01:19:18.294
Indian gambling is a very dull subject.
Trust me.

01:19:18.378 --> 01:19:20.379
What in the hell were
you thinking, boy?

01:19:20.464 --> 01:19:23.090
Tom, I don't know what this
story is about. I haven't...

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:25.801
You listen to me!

01:19:25.886 --> 01:19:30.055
I did not claw my way out of the
mosquito-infested flatlands of Laredo, Texas,

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:33.100
to become majority leader of
the United States Congress...

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:36.270
only to be brought down
by a no-good lying J...

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:43.986
Jack, you remember
Reverend Mueller...

01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:45.529
from my home
district, don't you?

01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:48.407
Yes.

01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:55.414
Take a seat, Mr. Abramoff.

01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:08.427
You got a lot to
answer for, Jack.

01:20:09.596 --> 01:20:12.223
And there's just so much
I don't understand.

01:20:15.101 --> 01:20:18.229
But first, I think it's
important that we, uh,

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:21.315
sit here together as
men of faith and pray.

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:25.945
Reverend.

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:29.198
Jack.

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:38.666
ln the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ.

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:43.879
Dear Lord, as we sit here under
the shadow of a gathering storm...

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.959
You know, I think
my life is over.

01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:29.133
Honey, I don't mean to change the subject,
but when did you start smoking?

01:21:30.802 --> 01:21:33.721
lt is the Sabbath, you know.

01:21:33.805 --> 01:21:38.559
Jack, have I not always
been straight with you?

01:21:38.643 --> 01:21:42.229
Not always the good
mother and devoted wife?

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:43.606
Of course you have.

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:47.443
Then I think you should just,
you know, go to whoever,

01:21:47.527 --> 01:21:50.654
confess and, like,
get it over with.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.156
Confess?

01:21:53.491 --> 01:21:55.784
I have no idea who
killed Boulis.

01:21:55.869 --> 01:21:57.786
Who's gonna believe you, Jack?

01:21:57.871 --> 01:22:00.789
And what about all of
this Indian gaming stuff?

01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:04.877
Honey, I haven't done anything that every
other lobbyist in Washington does.

01:22:04.961 --> 01:22:08.881
Charging high fees... Everybody knows I save
those Indian tribes billions of dollars.

01:22:08.965 --> 01:22:12.259
Jack, they're saying that you were
hiding the money you were making...

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:15.054
by splitting it with
Scanlon under the table.

01:22:18.683 --> 01:22:21.185
Honey, that's no different
than what Ralph...

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.231
Look, that's just a
technicality, really.

01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:28.442
Look, I'm gonna sell
the restaurants.

01:22:28.526 --> 01:22:30.736
I'm gonna hire the most
aggressive lawyer I can find.

01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:33.447
Those assholes out there are
accusing me of selling access?

01:22:33.531 --> 01:22:37.284
What the fuck do you think everybody on
"K" Street does? We all sell access!

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:39.787
That doesn't make
it right, Jack.

01:22:39.871 --> 01:22:42.581
Goddamn it! Stop justifying it!

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:44.375
It's all bullshit!

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:04.228
Maybe you're right, honey.

01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:12.569
I just got caught
up in all of it.

01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:18.534
I should have never gotten in
business with someone like Kidan.

01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.955
And I got greedy
with the tribes.

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:25.749
And I worry now...

01:23:29.504 --> 01:23:33.215
I worry so much that
I've let down God.

01:23:40.932 --> 01:23:43.392
How about me and your kids?

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:54.778
What about letting
down me and the kids?

01:24:00.076 --> 01:24:02.911
That's okay. It's okay.

01:24:02.996 --> 01:24:06.040
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:09.168
I got lots of friends
on the Hill.

01:24:09.252 --> 01:24:11.879
We have no friends, Jack.

01:24:11.963 --> 01:24:13.630
None.

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:19.178
All we have are people
you do business with.

01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:22.890
I have a statement I'd
like to make at this time.

01:24:22.974 --> 01:24:27.186
The good Lord has always told me the
difference between right and wrong.

01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:31.356
All I can tell you now is that if
someone is trading on my good name...

01:24:31.441 --> 01:24:33.609
to get clients or make money,

01:24:33.693 --> 01:24:37.946
it is unconscionable, it is illegal
and he should stop immediately.

01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:42.242
I am absolutely outraged by the dishonest
and duplicitous words and actions...

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:44.703
of Jack Abramoff.

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:49.249
NBC News ln-Depth tonight, a former
super lobbyist in Washington...

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:50.834
A lobbyist named Jack Abramoff...

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.503
Abramoff and his friends...

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.505
are some of the biggest players
in the conservative revolution.

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:57.341
They believe corruption and
illegal activities are a problem.

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:59.426
Mushroomed into multiple
investigations.

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:02.679
Exploiting Indian tribes,
buying members of Congress...

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:05.099
Potentially bad news for
leading members of Congress...

01:25:05.183 --> 01:25:08.894
Could prove to be the... the biggest
congressional scandal of the century.

01:25:08.978 --> 01:25:12.189
Could spell big trouble for
some big-time lawmakers.

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:14.233
Well, there are a lot
of people scared.

01:25:14.317 --> 01:25:17.236
This whole thing's turning
into the Enron of lobbying.

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.946
How the hell are we
gonna cope with that?

01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:21.240
Look what happened with those
accountants for Enron.

01:25:21.324 --> 01:25:25.202
They failed to cooperate and the government
took away their license to do business.

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:29.706
I figure we make reparations
to the Tiguas, Choctaws,

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:32.918
the Chippewas and
the Agua Caliente.

01:25:35.004 --> 01:25:36.964
- That ain't hay.
- Hey, guys, you're...

01:25:37.048 --> 01:25:39.424
You're costing us
70 million, Jack.

01:25:39.509 --> 01:25:42.136
Oh, that much? Do you know how
much money I saved those Indians?

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:46.056
Look, Jack, they're saying that you and Scanlon
defrauded those tribes of the 70 million.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:48.642
That money's gotta
come from somewhere.

01:25:48.726 --> 01:25:51.770
Who the hell do you think's gonna pay for this?
We are sitting in shit here, Jack.

01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:55.524
Do you have any idea, any of you, how
much money I give away every day?

01:26:00.864 --> 01:26:03.615
How soon can you be
out of your office?

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.535
Jack!

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.956
Uh...

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.876
- I need a couple of weeks.
- You have 30 minutes.

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:18.714
For God's sake, you're on the front
page of the Washington Post.

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:21.925
Again?

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:26.263
Is it above the fold?

01:27:03.593 --> 01:27:06.386
Enid. Enid?

01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:08.013
Would you put a call in...

01:27:08.097 --> 01:27:10.349
to my old friend Simon
Bowler at Paramount?

01:27:13.811 --> 01:27:17.731
Paramount Pictures.
It's a movie studio in Hollywood.

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:21.235
Call him, and tell him I
want to set up a meeting...

01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:23.487
because I've got a great movie
idea I want to pitch to him.

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:27.824
Do you want to hear it?

01:27:28.952 --> 01:27:30.702
Oh, Jack.

01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:39.127
Jack, how are you? I didn't think
you still had the film bug in you.

01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:41.546
Ah, you never lose it.
And you know what?

01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:44.883
The folks in Washington... they love movies,
even if they pretend that they don't.

01:27:44.968 --> 01:27:49.054
I mean, every week George Bush calls me to
ask me, "What movie should I be screening?"

01:27:49.138 --> 01:27:50.847
At the White House?

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:52.557
You're damn right.

01:27:56.354 --> 01:27:59.356
You've been getting a
lot of press lately.

01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:02.109
Feeling the heat?

01:28:02.193 --> 01:28:05.821
Oh, no, no, not at all. It'll all blow over.
It's par for the course.

01:28:05.905 --> 01:28:09.366
So you're here to pitch
us an idea for a movie.

01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:12.452
Based on the Old Testament.
A biblical epic.

01:28:12.537 --> 01:28:15.580
A kind of retelling of
the Ten Commandments,

01:28:15.665 --> 01:28:18.333
only this time, it's
called Pharaoh's Thorn.

01:28:18.418 --> 01:28:21.128
All right?
Now, here's the great modern twist.

01:28:21.212 --> 01:28:25.507
It's kind of a Bourne ldentity, action...like
Moses leading his people out of Egypt.

01:28:25.591 --> 01:28:27.342
Russell Crowe,
perfect for Moses.

01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:29.594
I think we can get
Ridley to direct it.

01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:32.597
Now, listen, man, this
film is epic in scale.

01:28:32.682 --> 01:28:34.558
CinemaScope. Big story.

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:38.228
Russell Crowe leading his people
out of Egypt to the promised land.

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:40.105
Happy ending!

01:28:46.404 --> 01:28:48.447
Excuse me. Yes?

01:28:48.531 --> 01:28:52.909
Jack Abramoff?
This is Agent Patterson with the F.B.I.

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.077
Yes?

01:28:58.416 --> 01:28:59.958
Michael Scanlon?

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:02.586
Yeah.

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:11.345
Oh, hey, guys. Come on in.

01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:16.933
Hey!

01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:20.562
Let me call my wife.

01:29:20.646 --> 01:29:24.107
What about my phone call?
Let me call my wife.

01:29:36.245 --> 01:29:37.871
I'm sorry.

01:29:37.955 --> 01:29:42.584
The right of individuals, groups and
corporations to lobby the federal government...

01:29:42.668 --> 01:29:45.587
is protected by the
right to petition...

01:29:45.671 --> 01:29:48.382
in the First Amendment of the
United States Constitution.

01:29:48.466 --> 01:29:51.551
Huh? So, what's the problem?

01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:54.930
Honestly, I don't know.

01:29:56.599 --> 01:29:58.266
I don't know.

01:30:17.495 --> 01:30:19.579
Very nice that you finally
have decided to cooperate.

01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:22.582
Look, I know you wanted me to do it for a while,
but we finally talked about it as a family...

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:24.418
and that's the decision
we've reached.

01:30:24.502 --> 01:30:26.420
Right. There's one tiny problem.
What's that?

01:30:26.504 --> 01:30:29.423
You're a little late.
Michael Scanlon has beat you to the punch.

01:30:29.507 --> 01:30:32.592
He negotiated a signed deal
with Justice on Tuesday.

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:35.053
Does that mean Jack
can't make a deal?

01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:37.347
I'm sorry, Pam.
They don't need him.

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:38.682
They don't need you.

01:30:40.393 --> 01:30:44.604
He kept track of everything... e-mails,
phone conversations, the lot.

01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:49.276
He was saying how the two of you scammed
the tribe of almost $20 million,

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.528
how the two of you
conspired to bribe Ney.

01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:54.739
The trip to Scotland and
meals at your restaurants...

01:30:54.824 --> 01:30:56.950
It's all out there.

01:30:57.034 --> 01:31:00.328
They're calling it the stream of things of value.
Well, that is bullshit.

01:31:00.413 --> 01:31:02.747
- It's a technicality. He knows it.
- Well, it's all out there.

01:31:02.832 --> 01:31:04.666
He's given all this
shit to Justice?

01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:08.044
Well, you know what? Your good buddy used
you as his "Get Out of Jail Free" card.

01:31:09.672 --> 01:31:13.341
Now, I'm afraid I got more
good news for you folks.

01:31:13.426 --> 01:31:16.094
The Indian Affairs Committee has
asked to make formal inquiries.

01:31:16.179 --> 01:31:18.972
They're gonna subpoena you
before a Senate hearing.

01:31:19.056 --> 01:31:20.891
A Senate hearing?

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:24.644
Jack has helped half of the Senate get
reelected, and now they're gonna...

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:26.813
Isn't there someone we can call?

01:31:26.898 --> 01:31:29.816
Who's the head of the
Indian Affairs Committee?

01:31:36.282 --> 01:31:37.949
John McCain.

01:31:39.952 --> 01:31:42.078
What are you gonna do?

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:46.291
I'm... I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

01:31:46.375 --> 01:31:49.544
I'm gonna tell them I was doing my goddamn job.
That's what I was doing. My job.

01:31:49.629 --> 01:31:52.005
Jack!
They are not gonna play nice.

01:31:52.089 --> 01:31:55.800
Do you understand that? I strongly suggest
that you go in there and plead the Fifth.

01:31:55.885 --> 01:31:58.970
The Fifth?
I might as well say I'm guilty.

01:31:59.055 --> 01:32:01.264
I will not plead the Fifth!

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:04.851
I'd like to thank Senator McCain.
Thank you, Senator Jarvis.

01:32:04.936 --> 01:32:07.270
I want to thank you and the
vice chairman and staff...

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:10.857
for your tremendous effort on
behalf of this investigation...

01:32:10.942 --> 01:32:14.486
and your continued dedication
and effort of many years...

01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:17.489
on behalf of Native Americans.

01:32:17.573 --> 01:32:20.158
Mr. Chairman, etched in the
history of our great nation...

01:32:20.243 --> 01:32:25.163
is a long and lamentable chapter about
the exploitation of Native Americans.

01:32:25.248 --> 01:32:29.125
lt began with the sale of Manhattan
and has continued ever since.

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:31.253
Mr. Abramoff,

01:32:31.337 --> 01:32:35.131
you had a relationship with a number
of native tribes, did you not?

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:39.344
Is it fair to say you felt these
tribes were gullible and naive?

01:32:39.428 --> 01:32:42.305
Senator, on the basis
of the Fifth Amendment,

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:45.517
I respectfully decline
to answer the question.

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:49.437
This tribe was never told...

01:32:49.522 --> 01:32:53.149
about the secret scheme that allowed
Jack Abramoff and Michael Scanlon...

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:57.654
to take over $40 million for
services dubiously rendered.

01:33:00.783 --> 01:33:03.910
Senator, I respectfully invoke
the privileges as stated.

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:07.247
You can continue dodging questions, Mr.
Abramoff,

01:33:07.331 --> 01:33:10.625
yet you rip off my
fellow Native Americans,

01:33:10.710 --> 01:33:14.921
you refer to them as
"monkeys" and "troglodytes"?

01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:18.425
Senator, I respectfully invoke
the privileges as stated.

01:33:18.509 --> 01:33:22.554
This is the most extraordinary pattern
of abuse and criminal conduct...

01:33:22.638 --> 01:33:26.099
that has been before this committee the
entire 18 years I have served here.

01:33:26.183 --> 01:33:29.686
Mr. Abramoff, you've proven
yourself to be callous...

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:33.148
and to only have been...
all about the money.

01:33:34.984 --> 01:33:36.693
Do you not feel any shame?

01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:40.113
Senator, I respectfully invoke
the privileges as stated.

01:33:40.197 --> 01:33:44.242
While these accounts of unscrupulous
men are sadly familiar,

01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:46.494
the tale we hear today is not.

01:33:46.579 --> 01:33:49.581
What sets this tale apart, what
makes it truly extraordinary...

01:33:49.665 --> 01:33:54.252
is the extent and degree of the
apparent exploitation and deceit.

01:33:54.337 --> 01:33:59.341
Mr. Abramoff, have you
nothing to say for yourself?

01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:06.514
Senator, I respectfully
invoke the privileges as...

01:34:15.733 --> 01:34:18.068
No.

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:19.402
Jack.

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:22.030
No. I no longer wish to
invoke the privileges.

01:34:22.114 --> 01:34:24.199
- Jack...
- I have something to say, and I'm gonna say it.

01:34:24.283 --> 01:34:25.575
Just be quiet. No, no, no.

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:28.328
ln fact, if we want to talk
"all about the money,"

01:34:28.412 --> 01:34:31.873
why don't we start with
the four $5,000 checks...

01:34:31.957 --> 01:34:35.669
I personally handed to Senator
Jarvis for his reelection campaign.

01:34:35.753 --> 01:34:38.588
And we know what that money was
all about, don't we, Senator?

01:34:38.673 --> 01:34:40.674
Or how about you,
Senator Burman?

01:34:40.758 --> 01:34:43.718
I donated $30,000...

01:34:43.803 --> 01:34:47.931
to influence your vote to keep
the Marianas open for business.

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:49.933
Remember?

01:34:50.017 --> 01:34:52.060
And what about you,
Senator McCain?

01:34:52.144 --> 01:34:55.438
You should be sitting in the seat
that I'm sitting in right now.

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:59.109
For years you've taken tens
of thousands of dollars...

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:02.028
from lobbyists just like me,

01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:04.864
representing competing
Indian tribes...

01:35:04.949 --> 01:35:09.285
who wanted to open up their own casinos
that would have shut my clients down.

01:35:10.079 --> 01:35:12.205
Sir, you're out of order!

01:35:12.289 --> 01:35:14.916
This man, this son of
a bitch is guilty.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.001
And if he's allowed to go free,

01:35:17.086 --> 01:35:20.422
then there's something
really wrong going on here.

01:35:20.506 --> 01:35:23.049
- Sir, you are out of order!
- Out of order?

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:25.552
You're out of order!
You're out of order!

01:35:25.636 --> 01:35:27.387
You're all out of order!

01:35:27.471 --> 01:35:30.890
This whole Senate hearing
is out of order!

01:35:30.975 --> 01:35:32.559
- Seize him!
- Remove that man!

01:35:32.643 --> 01:35:34.561
I've got a whole panel of senators
who love to take money...

01:35:34.645 --> 01:35:37.063
from anybody who's got a
fucking bank account!

01:35:37.148 --> 01:35:39.941
And you call me a fraud?

01:35:40.025 --> 01:35:44.320
You fucking hypocrites!
You fucking hypocrites!

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:46.448
You ought to stand
for something!

01:35:46.532 --> 01:35:48.324
You should protect the people!

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:50.076
Hold on! Hold on!

01:35:50.161 --> 01:35:53.788
I have just completed
my opening statement.

01:35:56.333 --> 01:35:57.834
Mr. Abramoff.

01:36:00.337 --> 01:36:02.422
Mr. Abramoff.

01:36:02.506 --> 01:36:04.174
Jack.

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:12.098
Senator, I respectfully invoke
the privileges as stated.

01:36:12.183 --> 01:36:15.935
And I'd say to you, Mr.
Abramoff, shame on you.

01:36:20.566 --> 01:36:23.610
Who the hell are you trying to look like?
Look, it's Michael Corleone!

01:36:23.694 --> 01:36:26.946
Hey, John Gotti!
You're a thief and a racist bum!

01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:29.824
We pray for you, Jack Abramoff!

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:38.708
Mr. President, at the
end of the day...

01:36:38.793 --> 01:36:40.710
I was vilified as Satan...

01:36:40.795 --> 01:36:44.672
and ordered to pay restitution of more
than $21 million to the Indian tribes...

01:36:44.757 --> 01:36:47.926
as well as 1.7 million to the I.
R.S.

01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:50.970
Adam Kidan was sentenced
in Florida in March, 2006,

01:36:51.055 --> 01:36:53.765
to six years in prison for
conspiracy and fraud...

01:36:53.849 --> 01:36:57.435
in the purchase of the SunSail
Casinos gambling fleet.

01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:01.022
Bob Ney was sentenced
in January, 2008...

01:37:01.106 --> 01:37:05.777
to two and a half years in prison for
allegedly taking bribes from me.

01:37:05.861 --> 01:37:09.280
In 2005, Anthony Moscatiello
and Anthony Ferrari...

01:37:09.365 --> 01:37:12.283
were charged with the
murder of Gus Boulis.

01:37:12.368 --> 01:37:16.037
In 2006, Tom DeLay stepped
down as majority leader...

01:37:16.121 --> 01:37:20.333
and resigned his seat in Congress after
being indicted by a Texas grand jury.

01:37:20.417 --> 01:37:25.713
In 2009, he appeared on the ABC
hit show Dancing with the Stars.

01:37:25.798 --> 01:37:28.466
My two old buds,
Grover and Ralph...

01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:31.511
they never faced charges
of any kind. Fuck.

01:37:31.595 --> 01:37:35.265
And poor Kevin Ring, well, he's looking
at five years in federal prison.

01:37:37.142 --> 01:37:39.644
As for Mike,

01:37:39.728 --> 01:37:43.314
well, he's still free and has taken up
work as a Rehoboth Beach lifeguard...

01:37:43.399 --> 01:37:47.443
as he continues to stay out of jail
while cooperating with investigators.

01:37:56.161 --> 01:37:58.872
Is President Bush involved, Mr.
Abramoff?

01:37:58.956 --> 01:38:00.874
Mr. Abramoff! Here! Here!

01:38:00.958 --> 01:38:03.710
Is the White House involved?

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:11.634
It's like we're starring
in our own movie.

01:38:13.429 --> 01:38:16.097
Sorry, honey.
Just trying to lighten the mood.

01:38:20.352 --> 01:38:22.312
Get it, get it, get it.

01:38:47.087 --> 01:38:48.504
Hey.

01:38:50.174 --> 01:38:52.091
Made bail, huh?

01:38:52.176 --> 01:38:54.677
Yeah, so far.

01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:56.596
Looks like.

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:59.015
Thanks for coming, Jack.

01:38:59.099 --> 01:39:02.352
Pam would be furious with me if she
knew I was even talking to you.

01:39:03.395 --> 01:39:05.313
We're still friends, right?

01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:15.031
"I know it was you, Fredo.

01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:19.577
You broke my heart."

01:39:19.662 --> 01:39:21.746
Right? You broke my heart.

01:39:23.999 --> 01:39:27.043
Or as Harry Truman once said,

01:39:27.127 --> 01:39:30.129
"If you want a friend
in Washington, D.C.,

01:39:31.715 --> 01:39:33.549
get a dog."

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.556
Jack, you have no idea...

01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:44.143
how much pressure they
put on me at Justice.

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:47.897
I'm sorry, bro.

01:39:48.691 --> 01:39:50.149
That's okay.

01:39:50.234 --> 01:39:52.819
My lawyer tells me you only beat
me to it by about two minutes.

01:39:58.117 --> 01:40:00.451
The student becomes the master.

01:40:02.371 --> 01:40:03.746
Your serve.

01:40:10.254 --> 01:40:12.255
You're a good kid, Mikey.

01:40:15.634 --> 01:40:17.844
I'll miss you.

01:40:17.928 --> 01:40:19.762
I was sentenced to six years...

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:22.849
at a federal correctional institution
in Cumberland, Maryland.

01:40:22.933 --> 01:40:26.060
Pam and the kids visit
me on weekends.

01:40:26.145 --> 01:40:29.355
I spend the rest of my time
leading a Jewish prayer group...

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.482
Now, guys, you all
have a story, right?

01:40:31.567 --> 01:40:34.193
And teaching a screenwriting
class to my fellow inmates.

01:40:34.278 --> 01:40:36.195
Act Two, a reversal
of that incident.

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.197
That's why if you look
at movies like Psycho...

01:40:38.282 --> 01:40:42.577
Occasionally, I'll find time to throw
darts at a photograph of George W. Bush.

01:40:42.661 --> 01:40:45.204
If it wasn't for all the money
I helped pour into Florida,

01:40:45.289 --> 01:40:47.331
that idiot would never
have left Texas...

01:40:47.416 --> 01:40:50.293
and I think you'd agree
we'd all be better for it.

01:40:50.377 --> 01:40:52.503
And despite the fact that
the Justice Department...

01:40:52.588 --> 01:40:54.797
recommended my sentence be
reduced by two years...

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:57.467
for fully cooperating
with investigators,

01:40:59.303 --> 01:41:02.055
on his last day in office...

01:41:03.515 --> 01:41:06.017
Bush refused to
even consider it.

01:41:10.606 --> 01:41:12.273
You see, to this day...

01:41:12.357 --> 01:41:15.026
I remain the Republicans'
worst nightmare.

01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:18.029
Not because I'm an icon to an era
most people would prefer to forget,

01:41:18.113 --> 01:41:21.657
but because once
I'm out of here...

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:23.868
God has given me a new mission...

01:41:23.952 --> 01:41:27.538
to remind the world what a bunch
of hypocrites they all are.

01:41:27.623 --> 01:41:30.625
You see, Mr. President, it's
time to think out of the box.

01:41:31.668 --> 01:41:33.669
- I know it's a moon shot,
- Thank you.

01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:36.839
but in writing you this letter
to a former president...

01:41:36.924 --> 01:41:39.133
who understands very well
how the game is played,

01:41:39.218 --> 01:41:42.053
I hope you might see
my point of view...

01:41:42.137 --> 01:41:44.972
and consider making an appeal
to the right Democrats...

01:41:45.057 --> 01:41:47.892
who might find it
useful to help me...

01:41:47.976 --> 01:41:50.394
so in turn I can
help all of you.

01:41:50.479 --> 01:41:53.356
Time's up, Jack. Why?

01:41:54.358 --> 01:41:57.110
Because my name
is Jack Abramoff,

01:41:57.194 --> 01:41:59.403
and I work out every day.

01:44:35.811 --> 01:44:38.479
Never before has an individual...

01:44:38.563 --> 01:44:41.607
who has been steadfast
to our principles...

01:44:41.692 --> 01:44:45.027
risen as high as Tom DeLay.

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:48.489
Tom DeLay is the most effective...

01:44:48.573 --> 01:44:51.450
He was the most effective whip
in the House of Representatives,

01:44:51.535 --> 01:44:53.953
and I would say he is the most
effective majority leader.

01:44:54.037 --> 01:44:57.456
And thank God Tom DeLay is the
majority leader in the House.

01:44:57.541 --> 01:44:59.959
Hear! Hear!

01:45:09.219 --> 01:45:12.471
I'll just, uh... just add one
more... one more piece to it,

01:45:12.556 --> 01:45:16.475
'cause I think, uh, w...we really
need to hear from Mr. DeLay.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:20.771
But Tom DeLay is who all of us
want to be when we grow up.

01:45:20.856 --> 01:45:24.150
- Hear! Hear!
- Congressman DeLay.
