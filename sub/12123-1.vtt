02:32.698 --> 02:37.119
BOY: This is one of my favorite
stories of all time,

02:37.202 --> 02:39.913
even though it begins in a basement.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.083
I'm gonna tell it
the way it was written

02:43.167 --> 02:45.502
by this guy- Bellini-

02:45.586 --> 02:48.715
who lives underneath
the amazing, the remarkable...

02:48.798 --> 02:52.218
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

02:52.343 --> 02:54.012
And, yes...

02:54.137 --> 02:56.181
he sleeps with a dolly.

03:07.317 --> 03:10.570
BOY: Bellini's job
is to build all the books

03:10.695 --> 03:12.614
for all the kids
who come to the Emporium.

03:12.739 --> 03:18.204
But it is also to chronicle the
life of Mr. Magorium himself.

03:18.329 --> 03:21.749
Mr. Magorium once made toys
for NapolÃ©on,

03:21.832 --> 03:24.418
beat Abraham Lincoln
at hopscotch

03:24.543 --> 03:29.215
and holds the current record
for time spent upside down.

03:29.298 --> 03:32.051
There were those
who called Magorium a genius.

03:32.176 --> 03:34.053
My mom called him an eccentric.

03:34.178 --> 03:35.721
And this one guy from Detroit

03:35.846 --> 03:38.974
inexplicably called him "Steve."

03:39.100 --> 03:40.893
But Magorium's story

03:41.018 --> 03:43.145
was reaching its final chapters.

03:43.270 --> 03:46.733
That's okay- all stories,
even the ones we love,

03:46.858 --> 03:49.027
must eventually come to an end...

03:50.737 --> 03:52.489
...and when they do,

03:52.572 --> 03:55.784
it's only an opportunity
for another story to begin.

03:55.992 --> 03:59.830
So the beginning of the end
begins with a chapter called,

03:59.955 --> 04:02.124
"Molly Mahoney's First."

04:04.000 --> 04:07.045
Molly Mahoney was the manager
of the Emporium,

04:07.170 --> 04:11.216
Mr. Magorium's apprentice,
and my only friend.

04:11.299 --> 04:14.679
In the mornings,
Mahoney would play her piano,

04:14.804 --> 04:17.223
attempting to finish
her very first concerto,

04:17.348 --> 04:20.976
but she never could find
the right notes.

04:31.237 --> 04:32.363
When she was younger,

04:32.488 --> 04:34.824
everyone thought
she was a musical genius,

04:34.907 --> 04:37.034
a brilliant pianist,

04:37.160 --> 04:39.078
and she believed them.

04:39.120 --> 04:42.458
But now,
as she became a grown-up,

04:42.583 --> 04:44.501
she wasn't so sure.

04:50.299 --> 04:52.509
I don't know why grown-ups
don't believe what they did

04:52.593 --> 04:54.011
when they were kids.

04:54.136 --> 04:57.347
I mean, aren't they supposed
to be smarter?

05:02.603 --> 05:05.230
What Mahoney needed was the
opportunity to prove to herself

05:05.355 --> 05:09.026
that she was something more
than she believed.

05:13.698 --> 05:17.327
And that opportunity
was about to appear.

05:17.452 --> 05:20.997
And so that's how
this chapter begins...

05:21.081 --> 05:24.042
with my hat getting stuck.

05:27.921 --> 05:29.380
MAHONEY: Eric.

05:29.506 --> 05:31.466
Hi, Mahoney.

05:32.550 --> 05:34.010
You're back.

05:34.135 --> 05:35.261
Yeah.

05:35.386 --> 05:37.347
I thought camp was four weeks.

05:37.430 --> 05:39.892
No, no... just the one.

05:40.017 --> 05:40.810
Uh-huh.

05:40.935 --> 05:42.186
My hat's stuck.

05:42.269 --> 05:43.354
Huh.

05:43.479 --> 05:44.939
Looks like you're
gonna need a ladder.

05:45.064 --> 05:46.023
Nah.

05:46.107 --> 05:48.651
I just need to jump higher.

05:48.776 --> 05:51.654
Eric, that's seven feet, at least.

05:52.696 --> 05:54.615
Seven feet?

05:54.740 --> 05:56.242
- Really?
- At least.

05:58.452 --> 05:59.870
You think I should get
a running start?

05:59.954 --> 06:02.581
Yeah.

06:02.706 --> 06:04.417
So, did you make any friends
at camp?

06:04.542 --> 06:05.543
Yeah.

06:05.668 --> 06:06.753
Uh...Jeff.

06:06.837 --> 06:08.380
Is Jeff real?

06:08.505 --> 06:10.215
Yeah. Sure.

06:10.340 --> 06:12.592
Is he an animal?

06:13.635 --> 06:15.929
He was a squirrel.

06:50.757 --> 06:52.216
Good morning.

06:57.722 --> 07:00.183
ERIC: Gotcha.

07:07.566 --> 07:08.817
Uh-oh.

07:10.486 --> 07:12.905
That's a good way to lose a train.

07:27.377 --> 07:29.296
MAN:
# I love to sing. #

07:29.379 --> 07:31.340
Mahoney.

07:31.465 --> 07:32.467
Morning, sir.

07:32.592 --> 07:33.676
Already?

07:33.760 --> 07:35.762
Drat. Come in, come in.

07:35.845 --> 07:38.056
How did you sleep?

07:38.139 --> 07:40.100
Upside down.
Made my feet tingly.

07:40.183 --> 07:41.309
Mortimer, get off the couch.

07:43.228 --> 07:44.521
Do you like turnips?

07:44.604 --> 07:46.731
Nobody likes turnips.

07:46.856 --> 07:48.274
So you probably wouldn't
like turnip pudding.

07:48.399 --> 07:49.484
Probably not.

07:49.567 --> 07:50.944
It's a shame because I made some.

07:51.027 --> 07:53.530
Sir, I was hoping to talk again

07:53.613 --> 07:54.864
about what we spoke about last week.

07:54.989 --> 07:56.991
About how paper
really shouldn't beat rock?

07:57.117 --> 07:58.409
No, sir.

07:58.535 --> 08:00.371
About me possibly finding a new job.

08:00.496 --> 08:01.497
That's what I was saying.

08:01.622 --> 08:02.706
What?

08:02.832 --> 08:04.375
I stayed up all night
making turnip pudding,

08:04.500 --> 08:06.043
and thinking, and
it occurred to me

08:06.127 --> 08:09.505
that I've owned the Emporium
for over 113 years.

08:11.590 --> 08:13.300
That's a very long time, Mahoney.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.760
Yes, it is.

08:14.844 --> 08:16.137
It's almost 114 years.

08:16.262 --> 08:18.180
And not once
have I even

08:18.264 --> 08:20.808
looked at a receipt,
so I have absolutely no idea

08:20.933 --> 08:23.060
what the store is worth.

08:23.185 --> 08:24.228
Well, that's probably not very good.

08:24.353 --> 08:25.396
Exactly.

08:25.521 --> 08:27.523
Mortimer... fetch.

08:31.736 --> 08:33.363
Stupid zebra.

08:33.488 --> 08:35.282
I'm hiring an accountant.

08:35.365 --> 08:36.408
- A what?
- An accountant.

08:36.491 --> 08:37.784
According to the word,

08:37.909 --> 08:39.828
it must be a cross between
a "counter" and a "mutant."

08:39.910 --> 08:42.080
And that may be precisely
what we need.

08:42.164 --> 08:43.331
That's great, but...

08:43.457 --> 08:44.541
I'm pretty sure that word
is pronounced...

08:44.666 --> 08:46.418
I placed a call
into one of those agencies

08:46.543 --> 08:49.004
and they said they'd send over
one of their best mutants

08:49.087 --> 08:50.088
sometime today, hmm?

08:50.172 --> 08:51.715
So consider the matter settled.

08:52.841 --> 08:53.842
How is the matter settled?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.093
Quite perfectly in my opinion.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.472
- Come with me.
- Sir?

08:57.597 --> 08:58.723
- Hmm?
- I'm serious.

08:58.848 --> 08:59.849
What?

08:59.932 --> 09:00.975
I'm stuck.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.810
Ooh! To my floor?

09:02.935 --> 09:03.853
No, sir.

09:03.936 --> 09:04.854
Then what?

09:04.937 --> 09:08.232
Like as a person.

09:08.316 --> 09:10.443
You remember
when I was a little girl,

09:10.526 --> 09:12.278
and I could play Rachmaninoff's
2nd Piano Concerto

09:12.361 --> 09:14.781
and everyone was talking
about my potential?

09:14.906 --> 09:16.449
Mm-hmm.

09:16.532 --> 09:18.117
Well, I am 23 now,

09:18.201 --> 09:21.621
and everyone's still talking
about my potential,

09:21.746 --> 09:26.251
but if you ask me to play
the song I know best...

09:26.376 --> 09:29.046
I'll still play Rachmaninoff's 2nd.

09:29.129 --> 09:31.924
May I suggest
you stun the world

09:32.049 --> 09:34.426
with Molly Mahoney's First?

09:34.510 --> 09:35.969
I want to.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.097
But I am stuck.

09:40.349 --> 09:41.683
Come with me.

09:50.943 --> 09:53.112
This, my lovely, is for you.

09:53.195 --> 09:54.531
Thank you.

09:57.617 --> 09:58.993
What is it?

09:59.119 --> 10:00.495
It's the Congreve Cube.

10:00.578 --> 10:02.747
It looks like a big block of wood.

10:02.831 --> 10:04.707
It is a big block of wood.

10:04.833 --> 10:06.793
But now, it's your
big block of wood.

10:06.918 --> 10:08.711
Thank you.

10:08.837 --> 10:10.630
I was just saying
last night

10:10.755 --> 10:12.841
I don't have enough
big blocks of wood.

10:14.384 --> 10:18.179
Unlikely adventures
require unlikely tools.

10:18.304 --> 10:20.098
Are we going on an adventure?

10:20.181 --> 10:24.270
Well, my dear, we're already on one.

10:24.353 --> 10:26.856
All I will say is this:

10:26.939 --> 10:30.860
With faith... Iove...

10:30.985 --> 10:34.947
this block... and
a counting mutant,

10:35.072 --> 10:38.492
you may find yourself somewhere
you've never imagined.

10:41.579 --> 10:44.665
And with that...
let's open the store.

10:44.790 --> 10:45.666
Wait, sir...?

10:45.791 --> 10:46.834
Mortimer, I'm way ahead of you.

10:46.917 --> 10:48.085
Stay out of the refrigerator.

10:48.210 --> 10:49.086
Sir...

10:49.211 --> 10:50.087
Yes, my honeycomb?

10:50.212 --> 10:51.173
You're wearing your pajamas.

10:53.175 --> 10:54.217
Flapdoodle.

11:06.396 --> 11:07.522
BOY: Fore!

11:13.028 --> 11:15.030
Whoa!

11:16.114 --> 11:17.491
Whoo-whee!

11:26.501 --> 11:28.294
BOY: Whoosh!

11:30.838 --> 11:33.341
Eric, may I borrow your hat?

11:33.466 --> 11:34.467
Sure!

11:42.391 --> 11:44.685
WOMAN: Oh, excuse me. Hello.

11:44.811 --> 11:46.771
Uh, how much are you asking
for that fish mobile up there?

11:46.854 --> 11:47.981
- Oh, that one.
- Yeah.

11:48.065 --> 11:49.024
Well, that's $50.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.609
- Fifty!
- Mm-hmm.

11:50.734 --> 11:53.028
50- don't you think that's a
little high,just for a mobile?

11:53.112 --> 11:55.614
Well, if you'll notice,
they're fresh fish.

11:58.617 --> 11:59.868
Uh...

11:59.993 --> 12:01.662
If you don't want
to spend that much,

12:01.745 --> 12:05.207
we do have that fish mobile
over there for only $17.

12:05.332 --> 12:07.334
But those are not fresh.

12:07.376 --> 12:10.170
And they're high in cholesterol.

12:16.218 --> 12:17.971
Molly? Molly Mahoney?

12:18.054 --> 12:18.972
Yeah.

12:19.055 --> 12:21.182
It's Dave. Dave Wolf.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.226
I was in your physics
class in college.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.352
Oh, hey!

12:24.477 --> 12:26.855
Hey! Holy... cow.
You still work here?

12:26.896 --> 12:27.856
Yeah!

12:27.939 --> 12:29.983
I mean, well... yeah.

12:30.108 --> 12:33.069
So, uh, what about you?
What are you up to?

12:33.153 --> 12:34.446
I'm an engineer.

12:34.529 --> 12:36.072
Congratulations.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.323
You know, it's funny.

12:37.449 --> 12:38.825
I would never have
recognized you

12:38.950 --> 12:40.618
if it wasn't for that finger thing.

12:40.743 --> 12:43.204
Hah- comes in handy
on the cash register.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.166
Do you still play the piano?

12:45.249 --> 12:46.584
I do. Every day.

12:46.709 --> 12:49.336
Well, I'm here for a week.
Where are you playing?

12:49.420 --> 12:50.963
My apartment.

12:51.046 --> 12:52.465
Oh, I-I thought...

12:52.590 --> 12:55.176
Yeah- do you want me to wrap
any of these for you?

12:55.259 --> 12:56.427
Oh, no. Thanks.

12:56.510 --> 12:59.138
Uh... you know, it was
really nice to see you.

12:59.263 --> 13:01.098
I always wondered
what happened to you.

13:01.223 --> 13:02.016
It's good to see you.

13:02.099 --> 13:03.017
Yeah, you too.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.852
Wait, I'm... I'm sorry.

13:04.935 --> 13:07.188
Bouncy Balls-
always trying to escape.

13:07.313 --> 13:09.523
Okay, out.

13:11.150 --> 13:12.151
Out.

13:12.276 --> 13:14.321
And you.

13:14.404 --> 13:15.739
You, too.

13:15.781 --> 13:17.365
Sorry about that.

13:17.491 --> 13:18.784
Take care.

13:18.909 --> 13:20.869
Okay.

13:23.622 --> 13:25.707
Ooh!

13:25.832 --> 13:26.958
Aha...

13:28.126 --> 13:29.377
Hiya.

13:29.461 --> 13:31.630
Just, uh... uh, shopping.

13:31.755 --> 13:33.298
Shopping.

13:33.423 --> 13:35.884
Just, uh... shopping.

13:36.009 --> 13:37.219
No matter what they tell you,

13:37.302 --> 13:39.054
you don't have to stay in the lines.

13:39.137 --> 13:40.180
WOMAN: Pardon me, miss.

13:40.305 --> 13:41.389
Could you help me, please?

13:41.515 --> 13:43.142
I can certainly try.

13:43.267 --> 13:46.813
My grandson wants a fire engine
for his birthday,

13:46.938 --> 13:48.648
with a ladder
that goes up

13:48.773 --> 13:50.775
and a hose that squirts water.

13:50.858 --> 13:52.193
And I can't find one.

13:52.318 --> 13:54.612
This sounds like a job
for the Big Book.

13:57.865 --> 14:02.578
This has all the toys
we have in stock.

14:02.662 --> 14:08.000
Now, "E" for engine
or "F" for fire...?

14:08.126 --> 14:10.963
Let's try "F."

14:17.845 --> 14:19.054
Wow!

14:19.179 --> 14:21.014
How did you do that?

14:21.140 --> 14:22.433
I didn't do it.

14:22.558 --> 14:24.726
You must have done something.

14:24.810 --> 14:26.145
Surprisingly, no.

14:26.228 --> 14:28.063
It's the Book.

14:28.188 --> 14:30.732
It's magic.

14:30.858 --> 14:32.568
Come on, guys.
Bring it up higher!

14:32.651 --> 14:33.610
Higher!
That's it!

14:33.694 --> 14:35.696
Hey, get that bird
out of here, will ya?

14:35.779 --> 14:37.489
Hey. Whoa.
Okay, that's right.

14:37.614 --> 14:39.742
All right, bring it up,
bring it up, bring it up.

14:42.704 --> 14:44.497
MAN: Hello, excuse me, miss. Hi.

14:44.581 --> 14:46.291
Oh, hi.

14:46.374 --> 14:48.460
Um... hi.

14:48.543 --> 14:50.044
Um...

14:50.170 --> 14:51.796
Hello.

14:51.921 --> 14:54.299
Um... I believe Mr. Magorium
sent for me.

14:54.340 --> 14:56.718
Oh. Wow.

14:56.801 --> 14:59.888
You're really well-dressed
for a shadow puppeteer.

15:01.389 --> 15:04.392
No, no... I'm Henry Weston,
the accountant.

15:04.517 --> 15:05.602
Here for an interview.

15:05.685 --> 15:07.605
Ah... hello.

15:07.688 --> 15:09.023
My name is Mahoney.

15:09.064 --> 15:10.608
I am the store manager.

15:10.733 --> 15:12.693
Pleasure to meet you.

15:12.777 --> 15:15.029
I have to admit,
when the agency sent me,

15:15.112 --> 15:17.656
I had no idea
that this was a toy store.

15:17.740 --> 15:19.492
Shh!

15:21.368 --> 15:23.287
If these kids found out
this was a toy store,

15:23.370 --> 15:24.830
we'd have a madhouse on our hands.

15:27.917 --> 15:30.586
That was a joke.

15:30.711 --> 15:33.005
I know.

15:33.130 --> 15:34.590
Okay.

15:34.715 --> 15:37.010
Uh... you probably want to speak

15:37.135 --> 15:39.054
to Mr. Magorium.

15:39.137 --> 15:41.014
Why don't you give me a second.

15:43.350 --> 15:45.310
BOY: Hi.

15:49.189 --> 15:51.274
What is it?

15:55.362 --> 15:57.364
What?

16:05.915 --> 16:09.168
It's not real nice
to stare at people, you know?

16:09.252 --> 16:10.419
Why don't you just

16:10.545 --> 16:12.130
go ahead and...

16:12.255 --> 16:13.798
This happens every time.

16:13.881 --> 16:15.424
Ah, greetings.
Edward Magorium-

16:15.550 --> 16:17.135
toy impresario,
wonder aficionado,

16:17.260 --> 16:18.427
avid shoe-wearer.

16:18.553 --> 16:20.304
You're here for the
accounting position.

16:20.388 --> 16:21.431
Yes. Henry Weston.

16:21.556 --> 16:23.141
Mm-hmm. Name the
Fibonacci series

16:23.224 --> 16:25.101
from its 11 th to its 16th integer.

16:25.184 --> 16:26.269
Hello? Grandma?

16:26.352 --> 16:27.937
Uh... 89,

16:28.062 --> 16:30.565
144, 233,

16:30.690 --> 16:32.066
377, 610?

16:32.150 --> 16:33.193
Perfect.

16:33.318 --> 16:35.237
The number four-
do we really need it?

16:35.362 --> 16:37.197
If you like squares, you do.

16:37.322 --> 16:38.740
Oh, I like squares.

16:38.824 --> 16:40.033
Good. Now,

16:40.159 --> 16:42.411
the hot dog to
hot dog bun ratio-

16:42.536 --> 16:45.747
why, for the love of mustard,
are there never enough buns?

16:46.832 --> 16:48.584
Extra hot dogs.

16:48.667 --> 16:49.585
Yes, but why?

16:49.668 --> 16:51.712
In case you drop a couple.

16:51.837 --> 16:55.257
What kind of insufferable
fool drops a hot dog?

16:55.340 --> 16:57.009
Anything can happen, sir.

17:01.473 --> 17:03.600
Anything can happen, hmm?

17:04.976 --> 17:07.020
How absolutely true.

17:08.313 --> 17:12.066
You're exactly the mutant
I'm looking for.

17:12.150 --> 17:13.401
You're hired.

17:13.526 --> 17:14.569
What?

17:14.694 --> 17:16.362
- You're hired!
- That's it, huh?

17:16.445 --> 17:18.031
- That's all I need.
- Uh, sir...

17:18.156 --> 17:19.907
- Don't you agree, Mahoney?
- No, not exactly.

17:20.032 --> 17:22.452
Perfect. I've heard
great things about you.

17:22.535 --> 17:23.494
Really?

17:23.619 --> 17:25.747
No, not yet,
but I'm sure I will. Oh!

17:25.872 --> 17:27.790
I see you've brought
your abacus along. Top-notch.

17:27.915 --> 17:28.875
Come along.

17:28.958 --> 17:31.587
I'll show you the store.

17:31.712 --> 17:33.047
# Bum, bum, bum #

17:33.130 --> 17:35.758
#The store and then I'll
show you my office... #

17:35.883 --> 17:37.760
GIRL: Duck, duck, duck...

17:37.885 --> 17:39.220
goose!

17:44.850 --> 17:47.770
We sell almost every kind
of whatnot imaginable, Mutant,

17:47.853 --> 17:49.396
from ant farms to zeppelins.

17:49.522 --> 17:51.607
I've owned this store
for 113 years,

17:51.732 --> 17:53.734
ever since I came
to this country,

17:53.859 --> 17:57.780
although I've been inventing
toys since the mid-1770s.

17:57.905 --> 17:59.616
- Wha... Excuse me, sir?
- Yes?

17:59.699 --> 18:01.952
Did you say 1770s?

18:02.077 --> 18:04.162
Yes, sir. So, as you
can imagine, accounting

18:04.287 --> 18:05.664
is a brand-new concept to me.

18:05.747 --> 18:08.708
You know, that would make you
at least 240 years old, sir.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.253
You're already hired, Mutant.
There's no need to show off.

18:11.378 --> 18:13.755
Now, follow me.

18:25.434 --> 18:27.395
Here we are.

18:29.105 --> 18:31.441
I haven't thrown anything away.

18:31.524 --> 18:33.484
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

18:33.568 --> 18:35.862
Are-are all these receipts?

18:35.945 --> 18:38.281
Mostly. Some are
important documents.

18:38.406 --> 18:40.324
Others might be doodles
I never framed.

18:40.450 --> 18:41.868
I can't tell the difference.

18:41.951 --> 18:46.539
So you've obviously never kept
an account of your income.

18:46.622 --> 18:47.582
No.

18:47.707 --> 18:49.041
Or filed a tax return?

18:49.167 --> 18:50.042
No.

18:50.168 --> 18:51.335
Renewed your city business license?

18:51.419 --> 18:52.712
Renewed my...?

18:52.795 --> 18:54.338
Renewed your...
Eh, forget it.

18:54.422 --> 18:56.842
You realize to
determine the worth

18:56.967 --> 19:01.180
of this store out of this,
um... fire hazard, really,

19:01.263 --> 19:04.850
is an insurmountable task,
and if you have...

19:04.933 --> 19:07.811
somehow managed to keep
from going bankrupt

19:07.936 --> 19:09.855
or being evicted,

19:09.938 --> 19:11.774
sent to prison for
tax evasion, uh...

19:11.899 --> 19:12.983
Oh-ho.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.735
...why do you want to do this now?

19:14.860 --> 19:16.236
Ah, yes.
Can you keep a secret?

19:16.361 --> 19:18.739
The firm holds a very strict
exclusivity policy.

19:18.822 --> 19:19.990
Don't worry.

19:20.115 --> 19:23.035
But can you keep a secret?

19:23.160 --> 19:24.496
Yes, sir.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.164
I'm leaving.

19:26.247 --> 19:27.624
The store?

19:27.707 --> 19:29.834
The world.

19:31.294 --> 19:32.670
You see these shoes?

19:32.754 --> 19:35.215
I found these
in a tiny little shop

19:35.298 --> 19:37.133
in Tuscany

19:37.258 --> 19:39.344
and fell in love with them
so entirely,

19:39.469 --> 19:42.889
I bought enough
to last my whole life.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.231
These are my last pair.

19:58.823 --> 20:02.827
So, if you'll excuse me,
I have a pressing marbles match,

20:02.952 --> 20:04.328
and I must warm up

20:04.453 --> 20:05.871
my thumbs.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.939
MAGORIUM:
Eric! Are you ready

20:31.022 --> 20:32.941
for our marbles match?

20:33.024 --> 20:34.901
- Mr. Magorium?
- Yes?

20:35.026 --> 20:37.446
- Does that seem right to you?
- Does what...?

20:43.577 --> 20:46.413
MAGORIUM:
No, this doesn't seem right at all.

20:46.496 --> 20:50.251
We must keep a watchful
eye on this, Eric, hmm?

21:40.886 --> 21:44.681
Don't worry, I'm...
fine up here, guys.

21:54.901 --> 21:56.861
ERIC:
This chapter is called

21:56.986 --> 21:59.364
"No, Seriously, Watch. "

22:02.909 --> 22:04.619
No, seriously,

22:04.744 --> 22:06.538
watch.

22:10.792 --> 22:12.585
No way!

22:12.669 --> 22:13.628
Come on.

22:13.711 --> 22:14.630
Whoa!

22:14.755 --> 22:18.050
This is so cool.

22:21.887 --> 22:23.848
- Come on!
- Let's go!

22:52.878 --> 22:54.379
Wow!

23:14.984 --> 23:15.902
Uh-oh.

23:23.201 --> 23:25.036
It's so good.

23:26.412 --> 23:27.997
Somebody!

23:28.039 --> 23:30.416
Help! Help!

23:37.173 --> 23:39.091
Pretty impressive ball, isn't it?

23:39.175 --> 23:41.136
Impossible to dodge.

23:46.850 --> 23:48.936
This boy's weird.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.377
HENRY:
Mahoney,

24:12.502 --> 24:13.962
have you seen Mister...

24:14.087 --> 24:15.046
Good night!

24:15.171 --> 24:16.548
Have you seen Mr. Magorium?

24:16.631 --> 24:19.551
Yeah. He's, um,
he's about this tall.

24:19.634 --> 24:21.594
He's got crazy eyebrows...

24:24.222 --> 24:25.765
He's upstairs.

24:25.890 --> 24:27.142
Thank you.

24:27.267 --> 24:29.936
You really got to get better
with the jokes, Mutant.

24:30.061 --> 24:32.063
I'm laughing on the inside.

24:41.031 --> 24:44.076
- HENRY: Mr. Magorium.
- Mutant.

24:44.201 --> 24:45.411
Mr. Magorium...

24:45.536 --> 24:47.997
Come to accept
my hula hoop challenge?

24:48.122 --> 24:49.582
We have a few serious problems.

24:49.665 --> 24:50.958
Ooh, serious problems.

24:51.041 --> 24:52.793
I don't have any serious problems.

24:52.918 --> 24:53.961
You do, actually.

24:54.044 --> 24:55.171
I don't think so.

24:55.296 --> 24:56.839
What about this, uh, invoice

24:56.922 --> 24:58.132
from this company in Brazil?

24:58.215 --> 24:59.258
They say that

24:59.383 --> 25:01.802
you owe them $300,000
for a magic

25:01.927 --> 25:03.637
doorknob?

25:03.762 --> 25:05.223
Oh, that's ridiculous.

25:05.307 --> 25:06.516
Thank you.

25:06.641 --> 25:09.811
$300,000 for a doorknob?

25:09.895 --> 25:12.063
I've never paid over $200,000.

25:12.147 --> 25:13.440
Here, catch.

25:15.358 --> 25:17.319
What about Bellini?

25:17.402 --> 25:18.361
Bellini's the
book builder

25:18.445 --> 25:19.446
born in the basement.

25:19.529 --> 25:20.947
You have a tenant in the basement?

25:21.072 --> 25:22.407
He was born there.

25:22.532 --> 25:24.201
I certainly can't ask him to leave.

25:24.284 --> 25:25.285
Okay.

25:25.368 --> 25:27.204
According to your
employment records,

25:27.287 --> 25:29.623
you've had several fictional
characters on the books.

25:29.748 --> 25:32.209
- Like whom?
- The King of Planet Yaweh.

25:32.292 --> 25:33.126
Oh, he's not fictional.

25:33.210 --> 25:34.212
Sir, there are people...

25:34.295 --> 25:35.296
He's not really
the king,

25:35.421 --> 25:37.089
and the planet Yaweh
doesn't exist,

25:37.215 --> 25:38.925
but he's not fictional.

25:39.008 --> 25:40.468
Well, that's the thing.

25:40.551 --> 25:41.469
If there's no planet...

25:41.594 --> 25:42.678
- Mr. Weston,
- Yes, sir?

25:42.804 --> 25:46.057
you can't blame people
for having aspirations, hmm?

25:58.903 --> 26:01.030
Oh.

26:01.155 --> 26:02.574
Sorry.

26:02.658 --> 26:05.828
I just sort of took over.

26:05.953 --> 26:08.747
I thought it was
funny, but I guess...

26:08.872 --> 26:10.999
Sorry.

26:16.046 --> 26:17.881
Hey, who did that?

26:17.965 --> 26:19.258
I did that.

26:19.341 --> 26:21.426
No, seriously, who helped?

26:21.510 --> 26:23.137
No one.

26:24.513 --> 26:26.890
Mahoney? Hello.
Got a quick question.

26:26.974 --> 26:28.308
Quick one. Quickie. Hey.

26:28.392 --> 26:29.518
Okay, Mutant.

26:29.601 --> 26:31.813
I need your help
explaining this history

26:31.938 --> 26:33.648
that Mr. Magorium has fabricated.

26:33.773 --> 26:35.358
What history he's fabricated?

26:35.441 --> 26:37.360
This one I've got
here- for instance,

26:37.443 --> 26:39.988
got a signed I.O.U.
from Thomas Edison.

26:40.071 --> 26:41.156
Really?!.

26:41.239 --> 26:42.907
"P.S. Thanks for the idea."

26:43.032 --> 26:45.452
With a picture of the
light bulb next to it.

26:45.577 --> 26:47.287
Is that for real?

26:47.412 --> 26:49.038
No. No, it's...
it's not for real.

26:49.164 --> 26:50.707
It's a signed I.O.U.
from Thomas Edison.

26:50.832 --> 26:51.916
Does that seem
like something

26:52.041 --> 26:54.085
that would exist in
the real world to you?

26:54.127 --> 26:56.504
Well, it does have
his signature on it.

26:58.965 --> 27:00.634
Hello? Please?

27:00.759 --> 27:02.136
Give me one second, please?

27:02.219 --> 27:03.262
Mahoney, wait.

27:03.387 --> 27:04.680
I just need...

27:04.805 --> 27:07.600
a simple explanation.

27:07.725 --> 27:10.227
Sure. It's a magical toy store.

27:10.352 --> 27:13.189
There's no such thing
as a magical toy store.

27:13.272 --> 27:14.607
Of course there is.

27:14.732 --> 27:16.859
When you say "magical,"
do you mean "special"?

27:16.984 --> 27:18.652
- No, I mean "magical."
- "Unique"?

27:18.777 --> 27:20.237
- "Magical."
- How about...

27:21.864 --> 27:23.282
"Really, really cool"?

27:25.117 --> 27:26.368
Okay.

27:26.494 --> 27:29.706
What's behind me, all right...

27:29.831 --> 27:30.832
is a toy store.

27:30.957 --> 27:33.502
It is a big one,
it is a weird one,

27:33.627 --> 27:36.087
but it is just...

27:36.129 --> 27:38.048
a toy store.

27:38.131 --> 27:39.424
I knew it

27:39.549 --> 27:41.259
as soon as I saw that suit.

27:41.384 --> 27:42.344
Knew what?

27:42.427 --> 27:44.054
You're a "just" guy.

27:44.179 --> 27:45.138
What's a "just" guy?

27:45.263 --> 27:46.515
A guy just like you.

27:46.640 --> 27:49.559
Same hair, same suit, same shoes.

27:49.684 --> 27:51.019
Walks around.

27:51.102 --> 27:53.688
No matter what,
he thinks, "Oh,

27:53.814 --> 27:55.023
"it's just a store.

27:55.148 --> 27:57.401
"This is just a bench.

27:57.527 --> 27:59.570
"It's just a tree."

27:59.695 --> 28:02.281
It's just what it is, nothing more.

28:02.365 --> 28:04.534
Okay, but-but this...

28:04.659 --> 28:06.661
is just a store.

28:08.412 --> 28:11.249
I'm sure toyou... it is.

29:43.594 --> 29:46.680
I must say...

29:46.764 --> 29:50.018
I am very disappointed in you.

29:54.105 --> 29:57.651
I understand feeling sad
or scared or even suspicious,

29:57.734 --> 30:01.404
but that is no reason
to turn gray and start pouting.

30:05.325 --> 30:08.078
I would expect
such behavior, perhaps,

30:08.161 --> 30:11.373
from a brand-new store,
or even a store a few years old,

30:11.498 --> 30:12.666
but a store

30:12.791 --> 30:14.543
your age...

30:14.668 --> 30:16.753
sulking?

30:18.756 --> 30:20.550
It is simply

30:20.675 --> 30:23.219
atrocious.

30:25.304 --> 30:29.100
The immutable truth is,
I am leaving tomorrow,

30:29.183 --> 30:31.477
and Mahoney,
bless her timid heart,

30:31.602 --> 30:34.605
will be given care of you.

30:34.689 --> 30:37.608
I'm sorry, my sweet,
but it's a perfect fact,

30:37.692 --> 30:40.778
and no amount of misbehavior
will change it.

30:43.698 --> 30:45.575
She loves you,

30:45.700 --> 30:47.911
as do I,

30:48.036 --> 30:51.623
and we must face tomorrow,
whatever it may hold,

30:51.748 --> 30:55.210
with determination, joy and bravery.

30:57.004 --> 31:00.132
So I suggest
you stop this petulance.

31:01.175 --> 31:03.010
Hmm?

31:03.135 --> 31:05.929
I expect you
to pull yourself together...

31:08.015 --> 31:12.269
...and put your best face on
by the time of my departure.

31:13.395 --> 31:15.273
ERIC:
This chapter is called

31:15.398 --> 31:19.360
"Fun and Mental
Is Fundamental. "

31:19.486 --> 31:22.489
And there's also this
new guy, the Mutant,

31:22.614 --> 31:24.240
who's a little uptight.

31:24.365 --> 31:27.410
Sweetheart, did you spend
the whole day at the store?

31:27.535 --> 31:28.953
I did lots of stuff.

31:29.078 --> 31:30.330
Like what?

31:30.413 --> 31:32.165
I built a sculpture,

31:32.248 --> 31:34.751
I got 20,000 paddles
on a paddleball...

31:34.834 --> 31:37.670
and I figured out
how to win at solitaire

31:37.796 --> 31:39.047
every time without cheating.

31:39.172 --> 31:41.424
Eric, those are all things
you do by yourself.

31:41.508 --> 31:42.592
There were...

31:42.675 --> 31:44.595
people... around.

31:44.678 --> 31:47.431
We agreed you could come
back from camp early

31:47.515 --> 31:49.683
if you made an effort
to make some friends.

31:49.809 --> 31:52.937
It's not my fault
people don't like me.

31:53.020 --> 31:55.773
People love you-once they
get the chance to know you.

31:55.856 --> 31:57.525
No, they don't.

31:57.650 --> 31:59.485
They think I'm weird.

32:00.569 --> 32:03.864
Because you build sculptures
by yourself.

32:03.989 --> 32:06.158
Because nobody wants
to play with me.

32:06.242 --> 32:08.994
Have you asked anyone
to play with you?

32:09.078 --> 32:11.038
Not really.

32:11.121 --> 32:13.792
Well, Eric, you have
to give people a chance.

32:13.917 --> 32:15.544
I know what'll happen.

32:15.669 --> 32:17.462
You don't, sweetheart.

32:17.587 --> 32:21.424
Trust me, people are
always full of surprises.

32:21.508 --> 32:24.594
Just...

32:24.719 --> 32:26.263
just pick someone.

32:26.388 --> 32:28.473
Anyone. Pick someone
you don't know,

32:28.598 --> 32:30.517
and try to make friends with them.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.018
See what happens.

32:32.102 --> 32:34.020
I don't even know how to start.

32:34.146 --> 32:35.188
Easy.

32:35.313 --> 32:37.065
Start by saying hi.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.685
# Don't be shy #

33:11.810 --> 33:13.520
# Just let your feelings #

33:13.604 --> 33:16.356
# Roll on by #

33:16.440 --> 33:18.400
# Don't wear fear #

33:18.484 --> 33:20.819
# Or nobody will know #

33:20.903 --> 33:23.739
# You're there #

33:23.822 --> 33:26.241
# Just lift your head #

33:26.325 --> 33:28.243
# And let your feelings out #

33:28.327 --> 33:31.163
# Instead #

33:31.288 --> 33:32.998
# Now, don't be shy #

33:33.123 --> 33:36.084
# Just let your feelings
roll on by #

33:37.461 --> 33:40.256
# On by, by #

33:40.381 --> 33:43.092
# You know love #

33:43.218 --> 33:46.429
# Is better than a song #

33:48.723 --> 33:51.351
# Love is where #

33:51.434 --> 33:54.062
# All of us belong #

33:55.480 --> 33:57.398
# So don't be shy #

33:57.482 --> 33:59.234
# Just let your feelings #

33:59.317 --> 34:02.445
# Roll on by #

34:02.570 --> 34:04.656
# Don't wear fear #

34:04.739 --> 34:06.116
# Or nobody #

34:06.200 --> 34:09.161
# Will know you're there #

34:09.286 --> 34:12.665
# You're there, you're there #

34:12.748 --> 34:16.502
# You're there,
you're there, there #

34:16.585 --> 34:19.045
# You're there, you're there #

34:19.170 --> 34:20.297
# You're there #

34:20.422 --> 34:22.632
# You're there... #

34:30.724 --> 34:33.060
# No, don't be shy #

34:33.143 --> 34:37.649
# Just let your feelings
roll on by #

34:37.774 --> 34:41.110
# On by, on by #

34:41.235 --> 34:43.905
# On by, on by, on by #

34:44.030 --> 34:47.701
# On by, on by #

34:47.742 --> 34:49.202
# On by #

34:49.327 --> 34:51.955
# On by... #

35:18.566 --> 35:20.234
MAGORIUM: Mahoney?

35:22.278 --> 35:23.863
Mahoney baloney?

35:23.946 --> 35:24.864
Sir...

35:24.947 --> 35:26.324
I have a riddle for you.

35:26.407 --> 35:27.408
Maybe not now, sir.

35:27.492 --> 35:28.451
Don't worry. It's easy.

35:28.576 --> 35:31.120
What's short, amazing,
and says "ouch"?

35:31.245 --> 35:32.456
I have no idea.

35:32.581 --> 35:33.499
Ouch!

35:34.666 --> 35:35.918
Very funny.

35:36.043 --> 35:37.836
Sir, what's wrong with this corner?

35:41.423 --> 35:43.926
MAGORIUM:
Apparently, despite my efforts,

35:44.051 --> 35:45.385
the store is not taking

35:45.469 --> 35:48.305
- my departure very well.
- What?!.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.140
Wait, what departure?

35:50.224 --> 35:52.726
It was intended to be
a spectacular surprise,

35:52.810 --> 35:55.312
but it appears the store
has other intents.

35:55.437 --> 35:58.273
That's one of my favorites,
Kristine!

35:58.398 --> 36:00.443
Wait, what was meant as a surprise?

36:02.654 --> 36:04.989
I'm giving you the store.

36:05.114 --> 36:07.033
You're giving me the store?!.

36:07.158 --> 36:08.368
Surprise!

36:08.451 --> 36:10.286
- Surprise, surprise.
- BOY: Excuse me?

36:10.411 --> 36:11.663
Yes, sir?

36:11.746 --> 36:13.540
Do you have Curious George
Goes to the Hospital?

36:13.665 --> 36:16.167
Hmm. Mahoney?

36:17.293 --> 36:18.294
I'll-I'll ask.

36:18.419 --> 36:19.420
An excellent piece

36:19.546 --> 36:21.506
of literature
and a fine choice indeed.

36:21.589 --> 36:22.966
BOY: Have you read it?

36:23.091 --> 36:24.217
Read it?

36:24.342 --> 36:27.387
I had brunch with the Man
in the Yellow Hat himself!.

36:27.470 --> 36:29.682
Okay, seriously, sir.

36:29.765 --> 36:31.016
What, Mahoney?

36:31.142 --> 36:32.810
I can't take the Emporium.

36:32.935 --> 36:35.229
But you told me you needed
a new occupation.

36:35.354 --> 36:37.857
I meant writing music,
not running the Emporium.

36:37.982 --> 36:40.860
Why not? You'd do
a splendid job of it.

36:40.985 --> 36:42.027
Mr. Magorium...

36:42.069 --> 36:43.779
Yes? Oh.

36:43.904 --> 36:45.197
Oh, thank you, Bellini.

36:45.281 --> 36:47.700
It's for the gentleman
with the blazing red hair.

36:49.702 --> 36:51.537
- Mr. Magorium...
- Yes?

36:51.662 --> 36:52.705
why didn't you tell me any of this?

36:52.788 --> 36:53.998
Well, apparently,
you misunderstand

36:54.123 --> 36:56.083
the rules of a surprise.

36:56.208 --> 36:57.878
But what if I don't want
the Emporium?

37:01.381 --> 37:02.883
Why would you not want the Emporium?

37:03.008 --> 37:04.634
Because I can't run it.

37:04.759 --> 37:05.635
Why not?

37:05.760 --> 37:08.096
Because... you have to run it.

37:08.221 --> 37:09.264
That's not a good reason.

37:09.347 --> 37:12.267
It's called "Mr. Magorium's
Wonder Emporium."

37:12.350 --> 37:13.810
It rhymes!

37:13.894 --> 37:15.270
- Oh!
- Not to mention the fact

37:15.395 --> 37:18.982
that... you're magic, and I'm not.

37:19.107 --> 37:21.651
Besides, what are you
supposed to do

37:21.776 --> 37:23.737
if I'm running the Emporium?

37:25.740 --> 37:27.408
I'm leaving.

37:27.533 --> 37:28.576
You're leaving?

37:33.164 --> 37:34.749
- BOY: Excuse me?
- Yes, sir?

37:34.832 --> 37:36.834
There's something wrong
with this book you gave me.

37:36.959 --> 37:38.294
Wrong?

37:38.419 --> 37:42.131
Well, this is incomprehensible.

37:42.215 --> 37:43.966
Hmm.

37:44.050 --> 37:46.803
The b... the book's just kidding around.

37:46.886 --> 37:48.846
I'll notify Bellini
immediately. Thank you.

37:48.971 --> 37:50.848
Mr. Magorium!
Mr. Magorium!

37:50.932 --> 37:52.350
-Y-Yes, Mark?
- Follow me.

37:52.433 --> 37:55.062
It's strangely weird
and weirdly strange.

37:55.145 --> 37:57.314
- What is it?
- We were finger painting,

37:57.439 --> 38:00.526
- Yes.
- as usual, and Katie looked up,

38:00.651 --> 38:01.944
and... see?

38:04.154 --> 38:06.949
- All the colors faded.
- We must check

38:07.032 --> 38:08.116
the Door of Rooms.

38:22.799 --> 38:24.592
Rats!

38:26.469 --> 38:28.888
Cheerleaders?!.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.976
Confound it!
Mahoney, check the Big Book.

38:39.858 --> 38:41.734
I would like...

38:41.818 --> 38:43.319
a lollipop.

38:48.658 --> 38:50.326
MAHONEY: Sir.

38:50.451 --> 38:52.997
Mahoney, the laws of gravity
have begun to apply.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.874
Sir, I asked the Big Book
for a lollipop.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.250
I got a lemur!

38:56.375 --> 38:58.502
A lemur?
We don't even carry lemurs!

38:58.627 --> 39:00.254
I'm not even sure
I know what a lemur is.

39:00.337 --> 39:01.422
Wait, is it
that primate thing

39:01.505 --> 39:02.631
looks kind of like a raccoon?

39:02.715 --> 39:03.841
Sir, we don't have time...

39:03.924 --> 39:05.843
Mahoney, we don't have
time to discuss lemurs!

39:05.926 --> 39:07.470
You're right!
Where's Eric?

39:07.511 --> 39:08.596
Uh...

39:08.721 --> 39:10.514
I should do something, too!

39:16.020 --> 39:17.730
MAHONEY: Eric?

39:17.813 --> 39:20.025
We need you.
There's a problem.

39:24.821 --> 39:28.033
Get off me! Aah!

39:28.116 --> 39:32.871
Somebody... give me a hand! Aah!

39:57.063 --> 39:58.731
Whoo!

40:00.191 --> 40:01.901
BOY: Help!

40:14.580 --> 40:16.333
Time to go.

40:21.839 --> 40:26.134
The store is undergoing
a little difficulty right now.

40:26.218 --> 40:29.179
Please leave
through the front door,

40:29.263 --> 40:31.223
calm and orderly.

40:31.306 --> 40:33.559
Ew! Ew! Ew!

40:33.642 --> 40:36.895
And maybe try to avoid
the slimy girl.

40:37.020 --> 40:39.231
ROBOT: Three, two, one, liftoff!.

40:39.314 --> 40:40.399
Sir?

40:40.482 --> 40:41.859
Close the store.

40:41.942 --> 40:43.443
Let us all reconvene upstairs

40:43.527 --> 40:44.611
immediately.

40:44.737 --> 40:46.698
ROBOT: Lift... ah, crap.

40:49.159 --> 40:50.160
What's going on?

40:50.243 --> 40:51.452
I don't know,
but could you

40:51.578 --> 40:53.872
do us a favor and try
to catch the lemur?

40:53.997 --> 40:56.374
I don't know how to catch
a lemur. I'm a dentist.

40:56.457 --> 40:59.127
Well, I don't know how to catch
a lemur. I'm nine.

40:59.210 --> 41:01.171
WOMAN: Excuse me?

41:02.213 --> 41:05.800
I am very disappointed
with this book

41:05.925 --> 41:08.178
I just opened.

41:11.431 --> 41:12.932
MAHONEY: The store's shut down.

41:13.057 --> 41:14.143
You're here?

41:14.268 --> 41:15.978
- Apparently.
- But not actually?

41:16.103 --> 41:17.313
MAGORIUM: Please sit down, Mahoney.

41:17.438 --> 41:19.982
We must commence
our conference contiguously.

41:20.107 --> 41:21.567
I must apologize.

41:21.692 --> 41:25.029
Mortimer and I had
an appetizer spread prepared,

41:25.154 --> 41:27.740
but... he ate the pancakes.

41:27.865 --> 41:29.533
- Who's Mortimer?
- ERIC: He's the zebra.

41:29.617 --> 41:31.535
- What?
- The... zebra.

41:31.619 --> 41:32.912
- MAHONEY: Forget it, Eric.
- MAGORIUM: Order, order.

41:34.413 --> 41:36.415
Now, first order of business: Eric.

41:36.540 --> 41:37.416
Yes, sir?

41:37.541 --> 41:39.001
Ingenious hat.

41:39.126 --> 41:40.377
Thank you, sir.

41:40.461 --> 41:41.963
Second order of business.

41:42.047 --> 41:44.174
The store is stunningly upset,

41:44.299 --> 41:46.259
as indicated by its temper tantrum.

41:46.343 --> 41:47.677
Temper tantrum?

41:47.761 --> 41:50.680
You didn't see it?
How could you not see it?

41:50.764 --> 41:52.516
- He misses a lot, sir.
- Didn't miss

41:52.557 --> 41:53.683
the relapse notification from

41:53.767 --> 41:55.352
the County Zoning Commission-
got that one.

41:55.477 --> 41:56.937
Thankfully. Or else
you'd run the risk

41:57.062 --> 41:58.355
of having to submit
an SP-435

41:58.438 --> 42:00.315
and a letter of notary.

42:04.444 --> 42:06.571
He was in the office.

42:06.655 --> 42:09.366
Aha, I see.

42:09.491 --> 42:10.409
Well,

42:10.493 --> 42:12.119
it is my belief that the store

42:12.203 --> 42:13.538
has been growing
increasingly sad,

42:13.663 --> 42:16.207
and today threw a fit
in fear of my egress.

42:16.290 --> 42:18.751
You see, I've tried

42:18.876 --> 42:21.587
to imbue this store
with the same attitude,

42:21.712 --> 42:24.090
imagination and emotion

42:24.173 --> 42:26.759
as the children who
come to play in it,

42:26.884 --> 42:29.637
and as such, it is prone
to the same outbursts

42:29.720 --> 42:32.473
as its sometimes puerile clientele.

42:32.598 --> 42:34.392
Like a temper tantrum.

42:34.517 --> 42:35.893
Precisely, Mahoney.

42:36.018 --> 42:38.271
- Maybe it needs a time-out.
- Hmm.

42:38.396 --> 42:40.816
I'm sorry. How can a store
throw a temper tantrum?

42:43.235 --> 42:45.612
Did no one explain
to the Mutant that it's

42:45.737 --> 42:48.240
- a magical toy store?
- I tried.

42:48.365 --> 42:49.616
It's a magical toy store, Mutant.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.118
It can do all sorts of things.

42:51.201 --> 42:52.995
ERIC:
But it didn't start turning gray

42:53.120 --> 42:54.454
until Henry showed up.

42:54.538 --> 42:55.539
Me?

42:55.664 --> 42:57.416
MAGORIUM: I realize that, Eric.

42:57.541 --> 42:58.125
Wh-What?

42:58.250 --> 42:59.501
Oh, Mutant!

42:59.585 --> 43:01.545
I'm sorry, if I'm making
your magical playland

43:01.670 --> 43:03.547
go on the fritz,
I can just submit

43:03.672 --> 43:05.132
a form and get another agent.

43:05.257 --> 43:07.260
MAHONEY: Does your whole job
consist of submitting forms?

43:07.385 --> 43:08.928
No, Mahoney, sometimes
I receive them.

43:09.053 --> 43:10.763
- Kind of half and half.
- Order. Order, order.

43:10.889 --> 43:11.848
Receive some, submit some.

43:11.973 --> 43:13.141
- But... this underscores
- Order, order.

43:13.224 --> 43:15.393
the fact that I'm in no way
responsible for anything

43:15.518 --> 43:16.936
that may have happened
in the Emporium today.

43:17.061 --> 43:18.521
I was just in the office working.

43:18.605 --> 43:19.564
There's that "just" word again.

43:19.647 --> 43:21.107
Give it a rest for
"just" a second, please,

43:21.232 --> 43:22.484
on the "just" word-
just the adults'll talk.

43:22.609 --> 43:24.319
- Okay? So it's just...
- Eee...

43:24.402 --> 43:25.403
nough!

43:26.488 --> 43:27.989
Although
Mr. Weston's presence

43:28.114 --> 43:31.117
has coincided with the store's
dismay, it is not the cause.

43:31.201 --> 43:32.911
The only reason

43:33.036 --> 43:34.496
Mr. Weston is here

43:34.621 --> 43:36.832
is to determine
my legacy to Mahoney.

43:36.957 --> 43:39.168
- Your legacy?
- Mm-hmm.

43:39.293 --> 43:41.462
You mean, Mahoney gets
to run the store?

43:42.213 --> 43:43.005
How cool!

43:43.130 --> 43:45.174
What do you mean, your legacy?

43:45.299 --> 43:47.510
You're his heir; you're in his will.

43:47.635 --> 43:49.011
Why is there a will?

43:49.136 --> 43:50.846
Why do you know there's a will?

43:50.971 --> 43:52.139
MAGORIUM:
I told you,

43:52.264 --> 43:53.641
my sweet.

43:53.682 --> 43:54.642
I'm leaving.

43:54.767 --> 43:56.227
But... I thought you meant,

43:56.310 --> 43:59.188
like, retirement or... vacation.

43:59.313 --> 44:01.690
What kind of leaving
you talking about?

44:01.774 --> 44:04.110
Mahoney.

44:04.236 --> 44:07.906
I think he means
he's going to heaven.

44:08.031 --> 44:12.202
- Right?
- Heaven, Elysium, Shangri-la.

44:13.537 --> 44:15.038
I may return as a bumblebee.

44:16.122 --> 44:18.041
Are you dying?

44:18.083 --> 44:21.086
Light bulbs die, my sweet;
I will depart.

44:21.211 --> 44:22.379
- Wait...
- HENRY: Mahoney.

44:22.504 --> 44:23.880
Wait.

44:23.964 --> 44:25.423
Are you sick?

44:25.507 --> 44:26.341
No.

44:26.466 --> 44:27.634
No?

44:27.717 --> 44:29.761
Well, then when exactly
were you planning to depart?

44:29.845 --> 44:32.974
Around 4:30.

44:33.140 --> 44:34.934
MAHONEY:
This morning he was talking gibberish.

44:35.059 --> 44:36.811
- MAGORIUM: Gibberish?!.
- And then he grew feverish

44:36.894 --> 44:37.937
and he collapsed.

44:38.062 --> 44:39.230
I did no such thing!

44:39.355 --> 44:40.731
Uh, for at least five minutes.

44:40.815 --> 44:43.734
And then when he came to,
he was... he was like this.

44:43.860 --> 44:45.111
- Delusional?
- Delusional?!.

44:45.194 --> 44:46.237
I'm not delusional!

44:46.362 --> 44:47.780
He hasn't been making any sense.

44:47.864 --> 44:49.323
Oh, bunkum!
Hogwash!

44:49.407 --> 44:50.533
Pure horseradish!

44:50.616 --> 44:52.535
He claims he owns
a magical toy store.

44:52.618 --> 44:53.828
I do. You work there.

44:53.953 --> 44:56.414
And that he's 242 years old
and an inventor.

44:56.497 --> 44:58.791
I am not 242 years old!

44:58.875 --> 45:01.879
I'm 243. You were at
my birthday party.

45:01.962 --> 45:03.255
You brought me balloons.

45:03.338 --> 45:04.423
Yeah, he's delusional.

45:04.548 --> 45:06.258
He may have had a stroke.

45:06.383 --> 45:08.468
A stroke?!.
You unbrookable ninny!

45:08.552 --> 45:11.680
The only stroke I have ever had
is one of genius!

45:11.763 --> 45:13.724
Okay. Nurse, can we
get him a sedative?

45:13.765 --> 45:15.726
Why are you lying like this?

45:15.767 --> 45:17.102
Because I have to.

45:17.186 --> 45:18.896
But your pants will catch fire.

45:18.979 --> 45:20.147
I don't care, sir.

45:20.272 --> 45:22.191
You have to live.

45:26.695 --> 45:29.156
Darling...

45:29.239 --> 45:31.242
I have.

45:42.212 --> 45:43.171
Hi.

45:43.296 --> 45:44.255
Hi.

45:44.339 --> 45:46.925
Uh, this is really hard.

45:46.966 --> 45:49.761
Yeah. It is.

45:49.886 --> 45:51.846
Because I got to tell you,
I'm really worried.

45:51.971 --> 45:53.056
Me, too.

45:53.181 --> 45:55.433
I can't track down
any insurance documents

45:55.558 --> 45:56.851
for the life of me.

45:58.812 --> 46:00.022
What?

46:00.147 --> 46:01.524
Hospital bills are astronomical
these days.

46:01.607 --> 46:03.317
- Mutant.
- Yeah?

46:03.442 --> 46:04.777
He might be dying.

46:04.860 --> 46:06.946
That means that we should be
even more prepared.

46:07.071 --> 46:09.865
Prepared? I found out
about this an hour ago.

46:09.990 --> 46:12.451
You know, I'm trying to be helpful.

46:12.535 --> 46:14.078
Well, you're being
positively dreadful!

46:14.203 --> 46:15.579
- Hey, it's just that...
-Just what?

46:15.704 --> 46:16.664
Well, nothing.

46:16.747 --> 46:18.332
Maybe you should "just" go home.

46:18.457 --> 46:21.335
- I can stay...
- Mutant.

46:21.418 --> 46:23.796
Go home.

46:23.921 --> 46:25.506
All right.

46:41.231 --> 46:46.319
Will any algae specialist
call extension 4324 stat?

46:49.239 --> 46:51.241
- You know...
- Hi.

46:51.366 --> 46:53.702
you shouldn't be
so hard on the Mutant.

46:53.785 --> 46:55.872
He wants to talk about insurance.

46:55.955 --> 46:57.123
I know, but...

46:57.248 --> 46:59.709
it's the only thing
he knows how to talk about.

47:05.631 --> 47:07.508
What are we gonna do?

47:07.633 --> 47:09.010
I don't know.

47:09.093 --> 47:11.846
But there's kind of another problem.

47:11.929 --> 47:12.972
What?

47:13.097 --> 47:14.182
Mr. Magorium...

47:14.265 --> 47:15.349
Yeah?

47:15.474 --> 47:18.436
He... doesn't have any pajamas.

47:21.689 --> 47:23.901
The doctors can't find
anything wrong with you.

47:23.984 --> 47:26.069
Of course not.
I'm perfectly healthy.

47:26.153 --> 47:27.571
Then why are you leaving?

47:27.696 --> 47:29.490
It's my time to go.

47:29.531 --> 47:30.908
That's it?

47:30.991 --> 47:32.367
What else could there be?

47:32.451 --> 47:34.286
What are we gonna do without you?

47:34.369 --> 47:36.538
Run the store.

47:36.663 --> 47:38.624
Sir, I don't know how.

47:38.707 --> 47:40.542
That's why I gave you
the Congreve Cube.

47:40.626 --> 47:42.169
But it just sits there.

47:42.211 --> 47:43.420
What have you done with it?

47:43.545 --> 47:45.422
I don't know what to do with it.

47:45.506 --> 47:46.632
It's a block of wood.

47:46.757 --> 47:48.217
Can you think of nothing?

47:48.300 --> 47:51.595
Well, I'm sure I could think of
a million things to do with it.

47:51.720 --> 47:52.764
There are a million things

47:52.889 --> 47:54.599
one might do with
a block of wood,

47:54.724 --> 47:57.101
but, Mahoney, what do
you think might happen

47:57.227 --> 48:00.104
if someone just once...

48:01.564 --> 48:03.149
...believed in it?

48:06.277 --> 48:08.279
Sir, I don't understand.

48:11.241 --> 48:12.450
Eric!

48:12.534 --> 48:14.994
What task delivers
such a wee and hale

48:15.078 --> 48:16.996
stripling
to this chamber for the ill

48:17.080 --> 48:19.249
and barely insured?
Hello, Doctor.

48:19.332 --> 48:21.961
I brought you some stuff
I thought you might need

48:22.086 --> 48:23.087
from the gift shop.

48:23.212 --> 48:24.171
Super!

48:24.255 --> 48:25.422
Eric, would
you mind

48:25.506 --> 48:26.924
keeping Mr. Magorium
company while I go

48:27.049 --> 48:27.967
speak to the doctor?

48:28.092 --> 48:29.134
Sure.

48:29.260 --> 48:31.095
MAGORIUM:
Mahoney, why do you need the doctor?

48:31.178 --> 48:32.054
Are you sick?

48:34.390 --> 48:36.308
What you got, Eric?

48:36.392 --> 48:37.476
Okay.

48:37.601 --> 48:39.103
- Okay.
- Here we go.

48:39.228 --> 48:40.271
Here we go.

48:41.355 --> 48:42.773
PJs.

48:42.898 --> 48:43.440
Yes!

48:43.566 --> 48:45.150
A toothbrush.

48:45.276 --> 48:47.903
Ah, morning becomes electric!

48:48.028 --> 48:50.448
And...

48:50.574 --> 48:51.825
A microscope.

48:51.908 --> 48:52.576
Oh...

48:52.659 --> 48:54.119
A water hose.

48:55.078 --> 48:56.621
And a nozzle.

48:56.746 --> 48:57.706
Ooh!

48:58.790 --> 49:01.042
A plank of wood.

49:01.126 --> 49:03.962
Well, plank you.

49:04.087 --> 49:06.256
And... this.

49:07.299 --> 49:08.300
Whoa!

49:08.425 --> 49:10.343
Eric, what is that?

49:10.427 --> 49:11.469
It's a euphonium.

49:11.595 --> 49:15.557
Magnificent! Hand it here.

49:17.476 --> 49:20.229
If there's nothing wrong with
him, we have to discharge him.

49:20.354 --> 49:22.857
We can't be responsible
for men of perfect health,

49:22.982 --> 49:25.860
no matter how old or magic
they claim to be.

49:25.985 --> 49:28.613
So the fact is,
you have to take him home.

49:28.654 --> 49:29.780
MAHONEY: No.

49:29.864 --> 49:32.116
You have to understand,

49:32.241 --> 49:34.619
he's decided it's his time to go.

49:34.702 --> 49:36.412
Then the best thing you can do

49:36.496 --> 49:38.664
is make sure
he has plenty to live for.

49:40.374 --> 49:41.417
What in God's name...?

49:43.377 --> 49:44.587
What on earth are you doing?

49:44.712 --> 49:47.257
Practicing the euphonium.

49:47.382 --> 49:48.258
The-the what?

49:48.383 --> 49:50.093
I thought I might give a concert

49:50.177 --> 49:52.262
in the psych ward tomorrow.

49:54.389 --> 49:56.266
There are people trying to sleep.

49:57.893 --> 50:00.437
Doesn't this hospital
need a signature

50:00.562 --> 50:02.397
to remove a patient's euphonium?

50:02.481 --> 50:04.024
Where the heck
did you even find this?

50:04.149 --> 50:05.442
ERIC: I found it.

50:05.526 --> 50:07.027
In a supply closet.

50:07.152 --> 50:08.320
We don't keep
musical instruments

50:08.445 --> 50:09.530
in our supply closets.

50:09.655 --> 50:12.616
Well, where else
could I have found it?

50:14.702 --> 50:16.329
What are you doing up there?

50:16.454 --> 50:18.832
Standing on a chair.

50:20.375 --> 50:21.918
Okay, that's it,
both of you,

50:22.001 --> 50:23.169
out of here -come on, let's go.

50:23.294 --> 50:24.587
You can come and see him tomorrow.

50:24.671 --> 50:26.923
Bye.

50:27.048 --> 50:29.092
MAGORIUM: Good-bye, Eric.

50:29.175 --> 50:31.803
Good-bye, Mahoney.

50:31.886 --> 50:34.681
Don't leave before tomorrow.

50:34.806 --> 50:36.850
Agreed.

50:39.853 --> 50:40.979
As for you,

50:41.104 --> 50:43.566
young man, you need your rest.

50:43.691 --> 50:46.026
I agree.
This has been exhausting.

50:49.446 --> 50:51.282
What was that boy doing
on the chair?

50:51.407 --> 50:52.575
Making sure

50:52.658 --> 50:55.286
I have enough space to sleep in.

51:08.841 --> 51:11.386
MAHONEY:
All right, if you're supposed to help me,

51:11.511 --> 51:14.222
if you're supposed
to impart some great wisdom

51:14.306 --> 51:17.058
that's gonna help me
fix everything...

51:21.146 --> 51:23.273
...please...

51:25.483 --> 51:27.569
...do it now.

51:34.451 --> 51:37.871
All right, I'll do it myself.

51:40.374 --> 51:43.294

51:55.515 --> 51:57.141
Hmm...

52:06.067 --> 52:08.403
ERIC:
This chapter is called

52:08.487 --> 52:12.991
"A Change of Heart...
of Mind... of Pants. "

52:21.625 --> 52:22.543
MAHONEY: Morning.

52:22.668 --> 52:24.753
Hi. Morning.
How's he doing?

52:27.172 --> 52:30.050
Look, Mutant, I'm just grabbing
a few of Mr. Magorium's things,

52:30.175 --> 52:31.969
and then I'm leaving for the day.

52:32.094 --> 52:34.471
Yeah, yeah. Just here
to work in the office.

52:34.596 --> 52:36.014
Unless...

52:36.098 --> 52:37.809
you want me to work out here.

52:37.934 --> 52:39.185
You can work
wherever you like, Mutant.

52:39.310 --> 52:40.186
No, no, I mean,

52:40.311 --> 52:42.021
in case there's, you know,

52:42.063 --> 52:44.440
a toy emergency, somebody
really needs something,

52:44.524 --> 52:45.817
you know, tiddlywinks.

52:45.900 --> 52:47.026
I could help 'em.

52:47.151 --> 52:48.611
- You could help.
- Yeah, you know,

52:48.695 --> 52:50.196
in case it's little
Timmy's birthday,

52:50.280 --> 52:52.323
and somebody's a handful
of Legos short,

52:52.448 --> 52:53.491
or whatever.

52:53.616 --> 52:55.326
Do you want to run the store
for the day?

52:55.451 --> 52:57.162
- Well, I'm here already...
- Mutant.

52:57.287 --> 52:59.122
Okay, I-I'd like to run the store.

52:59.247 --> 53:01.541
I've been waiting for two hours
on a very uncomfortable bench

53:01.666 --> 53:03.543
to offer to run the store
for the day.

53:03.626 --> 53:04.627
Why?

53:04.752 --> 53:05.713
Because...

53:05.838 --> 53:08.048
uh, because I'm a jerk.

53:08.174 --> 53:11.802
I just, I felt awful because I
didn't want you to think that

53:11.927 --> 53:15.014
I didn't care, and-and I do care.

53:15.139 --> 53:18.142
It's just...
some people bring flowers

53:18.267 --> 53:21.812
or send a card or hug people.

53:21.896 --> 53:23.439
You know, I make sure

53:23.522 --> 53:25.441
that people's paperwork
is all filled out properly,

53:25.524 --> 53:29.653
and... so... today, I thought
I'd try something different.

53:29.737 --> 53:31.280
'Cause I like you.

53:31.405 --> 53:34.367
You know, I do want to help.

53:37.037 --> 53:40.165
Mutant...

53:40.248 --> 53:42.375
when you look at me,

53:42.501 --> 53:44.628
what do you see?

53:47.631 --> 53:49.633
Really pretty eyes.

53:49.758 --> 53:53.386
No. I mean...

53:53.470 --> 53:56.848
like, do you see a sparkle?

53:59.184 --> 54:00.435
You mean, now?

54:00.519 --> 54:03.314
Like, glitter on your face?

54:03.397 --> 54:06.025
No, like, you know, a sparkle.

54:06.150 --> 54:08.069
I... What kind of sparkle?

54:09.779 --> 54:12.448
Like... something reflective

54:12.573 --> 54:15.660
of something bigger
that's trying to get out.

54:15.785 --> 54:17.620
You know what, never mind.

54:17.703 --> 54:20.206
It might not
be so much

54:20.331 --> 54:21.332
a sparkle.

54:21.457 --> 54:22.875
Maybe, uh, more of a twinkle?

54:23.000 --> 54:23.960
Forget it.

54:24.043 --> 54:25.002
Or a glint?

54:25.086 --> 54:26.254
It's okay.

54:26.379 --> 54:28.089
Uh, you've got the thing
that you do with your hands.

54:28.214 --> 54:29.507
That's a quirk.

54:29.632 --> 54:30.551
Quirk's not a sparkle?

54:30.676 --> 54:31.844
Mm-mm.

54:31.927 --> 54:33.470
Oh.

54:33.595 --> 54:35.097
Yeah.

54:47.985 --> 54:49.820
Good morning, Bluebell.

54:49.945 --> 54:52.573
- Good morning, sir.
- Look. Pants!

54:52.656 --> 54:53.824
What about them?

54:53.907 --> 54:56.994
Nothing.Just... pants.

54:58.245 --> 54:59.664
Me, too.

54:59.706 --> 55:01.958
Awesome! To the store?

55:02.083 --> 55:04.210
Actually, you are coming with me.

55:05.920 --> 55:07.922
I'm a little nervous about this.

55:08.006 --> 55:09.215
Why?

55:09.340 --> 55:11.134
Because it's mischievous
and childish.

55:11.217 --> 55:13.136
I can hardly wait.

55:13.219 --> 55:14.512
All right.

55:15.597 --> 55:16.514
MAHONEY: Ready?

55:16.598 --> 55:18.016
On "go."

55:18.141 --> 55:20.768
Not on "go."
It's always on "go."

55:20.852 --> 55:21.895
All right.

55:22.020 --> 55:22.979
Hmm?

55:23.062 --> 55:24.189
On "triskaidekaphobia."

55:24.314 --> 55:25.773
Oh, that's a good one!

55:25.857 --> 55:27.192
- All right, ready?
- Mm-hmm.

55:27.275 --> 55:28.360
- Set?
- Mm-hmm.

55:28.444 --> 55:30.112
Triskaidekaphobia!

55:31.197 --> 55:32.865
Triskaidekaphobia!

55:48.797 --> 55:51.717
MAGORIUM:
May I speak with your manager, please?

55:51.800 --> 55:53.052
Tim?

55:53.177 --> 55:55.179
This guy wants to talk to you.

55:56.848 --> 55:58.934
May I help you?

56:00.018 --> 56:02.604
It's an absolute honor.

56:03.939 --> 56:05.065
Now, I do have

56:05.148 --> 56:06.983
a question about the hot dog buns.

56:07.108 --> 56:09.653
MAGORIUM: That's the last of 'em.

56:10.946 --> 56:12.864
37 seconds.

56:12.948 --> 56:14.491
Great. Well done.

56:14.616 --> 56:15.867
Now we wait.

56:15.909 --> 56:20.121
No. We breathe.
We pulse. We regenerate.

56:20.205 --> 56:22.791
Our hearts beat.
Our minds create.

56:22.916 --> 56:25.461
Our souls ingest.

56:25.586 --> 56:28.965
37 seconds, well used,
is a lifetime.

56:44.272 --> 56:46.524
What mystifies me is
that no one knows, Mahoney.

56:46.649 --> 56:49.151
You would think that someone
in the hot dog industry

56:49.277 --> 56:52.071
would have some clue
about this obvious anomaly.

56:52.154 --> 56:55.117
- Here is good.
- Here is good?

56:56.618 --> 56:58.579
Mahoney...

56:58.662 --> 57:00.581
I'm very confused.

57:00.664 --> 57:01.582
Now what?

57:01.665 --> 57:02.875
Dance.

57:26.900 --> 57:29.068
# #

57:42.040 --> 57:44.250
MAGORIUM: You are brilliant!

57:54.720 --> 57:56.472
What a great last day!

57:56.514 --> 57:58.766
Hmm?

58:00.059 --> 58:01.810
Don't stop!

58:01.936 --> 58:03.145
Dance longer!

58:03.270 --> 58:05.314
No, it's okay, sir.

58:05.397 --> 58:07.191
Mahoney, why have you done all this?

58:07.233 --> 58:09.235
I wanted you to see
all the little things

58:09.360 --> 58:10.653
you're gonna miss if you leave.

58:10.778 --> 58:12.446
I see.

58:12.571 --> 58:13.989
I thought

58:14.073 --> 58:17.159
this was to be the best last day
of anyone who ever lived.

58:17.243 --> 58:18.828
Sir, this can't be your last day.

58:18.912 --> 58:20.956
Ah... but it is.

58:21.081 --> 58:21.873
No.

58:21.998 --> 58:23.208
And now,
thanks to you,

58:23.333 --> 58:25.043
it looks to be a remarkable one.

58:25.126 --> 58:28.421
All I have left to do
is use a public phone

58:28.547 --> 58:30.006
and my life will be complete.

58:37.430 --> 58:39.599
What?

58:39.724 --> 58:41.601
Right here?

58:41.726 --> 58:43.186
Oh, you're right.

58:44.938 --> 58:46.941
You're a genius.

58:47.066 --> 58:48.609
Very good with numbers.

58:48.693 --> 58:50.027
You should teach.

58:50.111 --> 58:52.947
- Morning.
- Hi. Yes. Morning.

58:53.072 --> 58:54.740
Wow, it's quiet today.

58:54.866 --> 58:56.576
Yeah, yeah.

58:56.701 --> 58:57.785
No one's been in.

58:57.910 --> 58:59.704
Mahoney left.
Just been me thus far.

58:59.787 --> 59:01.914
You've been here
all by yourself all morning?

59:01.998 --> 59:03.082
Yeah.

59:03.207 --> 59:05.001
And the store didn't collapse

59:05.126 --> 59:06.711
around you?

59:12.758 --> 59:14.802
- Yes.
- What are you doing?

59:14.927 --> 59:17.806
I am taking down merchandise codes.

59:17.890 --> 59:19.975
No. With Einstein.

59:20.100 --> 59:21.435
With...?

59:21.518 --> 59:24.021
With Einstein?

59:24.146 --> 59:25.439
Einst... Oh.

59:25.564 --> 59:28.275
Just, I was fiddling.

59:28.358 --> 59:29.818
Occupying my time.

59:29.902 --> 59:31.069
You mean, pretending?

59:31.153 --> 59:33.614
Wha... No, that's not...

59:33.739 --> 59:35.908
Just keeping my mind active,

59:35.991 --> 59:39.119
you know, when there wasn't
much else to think about.

59:39.244 --> 59:40.495
Do you know what I mean?

59:40.579 --> 59:41.538
Yeah.

59:41.622 --> 59:42.623
Good.

59:42.748 --> 59:44.042
That's called pretending.

59:47.212 --> 59:48.463
It's okay.

59:48.588 --> 59:51.424
You can stay out here
and play with the toys, Mutant.

59:51.549 --> 59:53.218
I won't tell anyone.

59:56.429 --> 59:57.430
Here you go.

59:57.514 --> 59:59.682
Great. Let's go.

01:00:01.601 --> 01:00:03.561
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

01:00:03.686 --> 01:00:06.481
We sell toys.
We do not fix car transmissions.

01:00:06.564 --> 01:00:08.274
Eric, I am calling

01:00:08.316 --> 01:00:11.236
from a public phone!

01:00:11.361 --> 01:00:13.197
Good for you, sir.

01:00:13.322 --> 01:00:15.991
Now, I have two things
I must tell you.

01:00:16.116 --> 01:00:18.077
Firstly, capital hat!

01:00:20.037 --> 01:00:21.664
Thank you, sir.

01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:22.998
And secondly,

01:00:23.123 --> 01:00:25.626
I do wish you'd find some friends.

01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:27.169
Okay?

01:00:27.294 --> 01:00:28.837
Okay.

01:00:28.963 --> 01:00:31.090
I love you.

01:00:32.633 --> 01:00:34.385
Now, put the Mutant

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:35.636
on the phone.

01:00:35.678 --> 01:00:38.597
Henry, the phone's for you.

01:00:40.349 --> 01:00:41.518
Hello?

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.936
Mutant, I have something

01:00:43.019 --> 01:00:45.105
very, very supremely important
to tell you.

01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:47.232
OPERATOR:
Please deposit an additional

01:00:47.357 --> 01:00:48.233
35 cents.

01:00:48.358 --> 01:00:49.317
Hello?

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:52.904
- Please deposit an additional
- Hello?

01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:55.031
- 35 cents.
- Hello?

01:00:55.156 --> 01:00:57.826
- Please deposit an additional
- Hello?

01:00:57.909 --> 01:00:59.035
35 cents.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.127
Oh, well, he'll figure it out.

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:17.638
Okay, try again.

01:01:17.722 --> 01:01:19.307
Come on!

01:01:21.559 --> 01:01:24.395
Come on, you're being ridiculous.

01:01:24.478 --> 01:01:28.274
You're gonna have to do it sometime.

01:01:32.278 --> 01:01:33.863
Try again.

01:01:37.033 --> 01:01:38.243
What are you doing?

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:39.411
We got a nervous Slinky.

01:01:41.872 --> 01:01:43.040
We handled ourselves pretty well.

01:01:43.165 --> 01:01:45.083
I think we make a good team.

01:01:45.209 --> 01:01:46.585
Yeah, I think so.

01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:48.962
The toys are still upset, though.

01:01:49.087 --> 01:01:50.964
Yeah.

01:01:51.089 --> 01:01:53.592
- Yeah.
- Should we call it a day?

01:01:54.635 --> 01:01:56.136
Yes, it looks like it.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.763
Good. Checkers.

01:01:57.888 --> 01:01:58.889
What?

01:01:59.014 --> 01:02:00.766
Checkers.

01:02:00.891 --> 01:02:03.519
Uh, no, I got to get
back to the agency.

01:02:03.602 --> 01:02:04.811
Come on, Henry.

01:02:04.937 --> 01:02:06.481
One game.

01:02:06.606 --> 01:02:08.483
Sorry. Some other time.

01:02:08.608 --> 01:02:10.652
ERIC: Just one?

01:02:27.377 --> 01:02:28.670
Henry.

01:02:28.795 --> 01:02:30.547
Yes, Eric?

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.549
Hey, um...

01:02:32.632 --> 01:02:34.175
do you mind...

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.469
Yes?

01:02:35.594 --> 01:02:36.595
Well,

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.764
Mahoney usually
walks me home, and...

01:02:38.889 --> 01:02:40.099
it's getting dark.

01:02:40.224 --> 01:02:42.059
Do you want me to walk you home?

01:02:42.142 --> 01:02:43.394
Thanks.

01:02:44.937 --> 01:02:48.482
I got to ask you where
you get those hats from.

01:02:48.607 --> 01:02:49.859
From my room.

01:02:49.942 --> 01:02:52.945
Yeah? Every day I see you
in a different hat.

01:02:53.028 --> 01:02:55.155
Yeah. I collect them.

01:02:55.281 --> 01:02:57.283
You collect them, huh?

01:02:57.408 --> 01:03:00.911
Mr. Magorium says I have
the neatest hat collection

01:03:01.036 --> 01:03:02.162
he's ever seen.

01:03:02.288 --> 01:03:05.083
I know people who,
you know, own several hats,

01:03:05.208 --> 01:03:07.127
but I don't think
I've ever heard

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:10.881
of a hat collector before.

01:03:12.757 --> 01:03:16.052
Do you want to see 'em?

01:03:16.178 --> 01:03:18.680
Just try not to get too overwhelmed.

01:03:18.763 --> 01:03:20.307
Got it.

01:03:30.442 --> 01:03:33.321
Oh, my.

01:03:33.404 --> 01:03:35.948
Pretty neat, huh?

01:03:36.073 --> 01:03:40.203
Eric, when you said a lot,
I was expecting, like, 20.

01:03:40.286 --> 01:03:42.288
Oh, no- I have more than that.

01:03:42.413 --> 01:03:43.748
You wear all these?

01:03:43.831 --> 01:03:45.041
Sure.

01:03:45.124 --> 01:03:46.709
What good would they be
if I didn't wear 'em?

01:03:46.834 --> 01:03:48.002
Wow.

01:03:50.421 --> 01:03:51.881
You want to try one on?

01:03:51.964 --> 01:03:54.634
No. Thank you. I'm fine.

01:03:54.717 --> 01:03:56.469
- Henry.
- Yes?

01:03:56.552 --> 01:03:59.764
I think we both know
you want to try a hat on.

01:03:59.848 --> 01:04:01.767
I don't know where to begin!

01:04:01.892 --> 01:04:04.144
I don't know where to start! Oh...!

01:04:04.228 --> 01:04:08.482
We have got to buy the dragon
a toothbrush, Your Excellency.

01:04:08.565 --> 01:04:10.734
After devouring most
of the township,

01:04:10.859 --> 01:04:12.486
his breath is just awful!

01:04:12.611 --> 01:04:15.155
He ate the town?!.

01:04:15.239 --> 01:04:16.865
He ate the baker and his wife,

01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:20.160
he ate... the woodsmith
and his three sons,

01:04:20.285 --> 01:04:22.246
and then for sweets-
come closer-

01:04:22.371 --> 01:04:23.789
he ate the cobbler.

01:04:23.872 --> 01:04:25.624
Good idea, Fool!

01:04:25.707 --> 01:04:27.417
Go brush the dragon's teeth!

01:04:27.501 --> 01:04:29.504
Me? He doesn't like me.

01:04:29.629 --> 01:04:30.505
And...

01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:31.881
What do you mean, "and"?

01:04:31.965 --> 01:04:33.091
And he's quite large.

01:04:33.174 --> 01:04:34.926
And...

01:04:34.968 --> 01:04:37.554
I look surprisingly like...

01:04:37.679 --> 01:04:39.389
a toothpick from afar.

01:04:39.514 --> 01:04:41.057
NANCY: Eric?

01:04:42.767 --> 01:04:44.310
Do you have someone...

01:04:45.728 --> 01:04:46.813
Who's this?

01:04:46.938 --> 01:04:48.356
The Mutant.

01:04:48.439 --> 01:04:49.190
The what?

01:04:49.315 --> 01:04:50.441
Uh, Henry.

01:04:50.567 --> 01:04:52.694
Henry. Sorry. Henry.

01:04:52.819 --> 01:04:54.195
Henry. Henry who?

01:04:54.279 --> 01:04:56.949
Henry Weston.
I-I work at the...

01:04:57.074 --> 01:04:59.034
What are you doing in my house?

01:04:59.159 --> 01:05:01.871
Uh... I-I was pretending.

01:05:01.954 --> 01:05:03.622
ERIC: Don't be mean to him.

01:05:03.706 --> 01:05:05.207
Henry's my friend.

01:05:07.126 --> 01:05:08.544
I am?

01:05:10.087 --> 01:05:11.380
Yeah.

01:05:11.505 --> 01:05:13.173
Cool.

01:05:13.299 --> 01:05:15.342
NANCY:
A little old, don't you think,

01:05:15.467 --> 01:05:16.552
to be playing dress-up?

01:05:16.677 --> 01:05:18.387
Yes, yes. Absolutely.

01:05:18.512 --> 01:05:19.638
Sorry. And it is late.

01:05:19.763 --> 01:05:21.640
I have some work
I needed to do,

01:05:21.765 --> 01:05:23.976
I should be doing,
I will be doing now.

01:05:24.059 --> 01:05:25.604
- See you later.
- Don't you have chores, Eric?

01:05:25.687 --> 01:05:28.690
You know, actually, he worked
all day at the store...

01:05:28.815 --> 01:05:30.650
I thought you said you were leaving.

01:05:30.734 --> 01:05:33.570
Certainly.
Excuse me. See ya.

01:06:10.858 --> 01:06:12.777
Well, Mahoney...

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.403
Don't go.

01:06:14.529 --> 01:06:17.114
My darling.

01:06:17.198 --> 01:06:18.824
I'm not ready.

01:06:20.034 --> 01:06:22.746
I'm not ready for it to end.

01:06:22.871 --> 01:06:25.541
I'm sorry.

01:06:37.511 --> 01:06:39.805
When King Lear dies in Act 5,

01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:42.057
do you know what Shakespeare
has written?

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:46.103
He's written, "He dies."

01:06:46.186 --> 01:06:48.188
That's all, nothing more.

01:06:48.313 --> 01:06:52.610
No fanfare, no metaphor,
no brilliant final words.

01:06:52.735 --> 01:06:55.572
The culmination
of the most influential work

01:06:55.697 --> 01:06:59.868
of dramatic literature is:
"He dies."

01:07:02.328 --> 01:07:05.039
It takes Shakespeare, a genius,
to come up with "He dies."

01:07:08.251 --> 01:07:11.421
And yet every time
I read those two words,

01:07:11.504 --> 01:07:15.466
I find myself overwhelmed
with dysphoria.

01:07:15.592 --> 01:07:18.261
And I know it's only
natural to be sad,

01:07:18.344 --> 01:07:20.681
but not because
of the words "He dies,"

01:07:20.764 --> 01:07:24.852
but because of the life we saw
prior to the words.

01:07:30.441 --> 01:07:34.320
I've lived all five
of my acts, Mahoney,

01:07:34.445 --> 01:07:38.240
and I am not asking you
to be happy that I must go.

01:07:38.324 --> 01:07:39.992
I'm only asking
that you

01:07:40.075 --> 01:07:41.952
turn the page,

01:07:42.077 --> 01:07:44.580
continue reading...

01:07:44.705 --> 01:07:47.041
and let the next story begin.

01:07:47.124 --> 01:07:51.796
And if anyone ever asks
what became of me,

01:07:51.922 --> 01:07:53.882
you relate my life

01:07:54.007 --> 01:07:55.842
in all its wonder,

01:07:55.967 --> 01:08:01.890
and end it with
a simple and modest "He died."

01:08:03.808 --> 01:08:05.852
I love you.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.777
I love you, too.

01:08:22.995 --> 01:08:26.916
Your life is an occasion.

01:08:26.999 --> 01:08:28.834
Rise to it.

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:11.775
Good-bye, my love.

01:11:41.367 --> 01:11:44.329
I-It's... not that bad.

01:11:44.454 --> 01:11:47.498
We can bring it back.

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:48.875
Right, Mahoney?

01:11:48.958 --> 01:11:51.461
Mahoney?

01:11:51.544 --> 01:11:53.296
Let's just run the store and...

01:11:53.421 --> 01:11:54.547
see if it picks up.

01:11:54.672 --> 01:11:57.008
- I'm sorry, Eric.
- I'll help you.

01:11:57.133 --> 01:11:58.426
Just don't leave.

01:11:58.551 --> 01:12:00.887
- Eric...
- Mahoney, don't leave.

01:12:01.012 --> 01:12:02.430
I'm sorry.

01:12:02.513 --> 01:12:05.017
It just needs a little magic.

01:12:05.142 --> 01:12:07.186
I know.

01:12:07.269 --> 01:12:09.313
I don't have any.

01:12:58.572 --> 01:13:00.783
ERIC:
This chapter is called

01:13:00.825 --> 01:13:02.869
"A New Beginning. "

01:13:38.530 --> 01:13:39.573
Eric?

01:13:39.698 --> 01:13:40.991
What are you doing?

01:13:41.074 --> 01:13:43.160
I'm playing "Jennifer Juniper."

01:13:43.243 --> 01:13:44.328
Why?

01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:46.455
Because someone requested it.

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.415
No, why are you here?

01:13:48.498 --> 01:13:50.626
Because I have to make money, Eric.

01:13:50.667 --> 01:13:51.960
Then run the store.

01:13:52.085 --> 01:13:53.587
I can't.

01:13:53.712 --> 01:13:54.880
Look.

01:13:55.005 --> 01:13:57.341
I would love to run the store,
but I can't.

01:13:57.424 --> 01:13:58.468
I'm not Mr. Magorium.

01:13:58.551 --> 01:14:00.094
Is that why it's for sale?

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:01.387
Yeah.

01:14:01.512 --> 01:14:02.680
Look, I'm sorry.

01:14:02.764 --> 01:14:04.974
I didn't mean to let you down.

01:14:05.099 --> 01:14:06.100
Is this what you want?

01:14:06.226 --> 01:14:07.685
No...

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:10.647
No, but I don't know
how to do anything else.

01:14:10.772 --> 01:14:12.148
Stop saying that.

01:14:12.232 --> 01:14:15.360
Eric, I understand
this is hard for you.

01:14:15.443 --> 01:14:17.987
This is really hard for me, too.

01:14:19.614 --> 01:14:22.367
But I cannot be a kid anymore.

01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:25.078
That's why Mr. Magorium
gave you the store.

01:14:45.057 --> 01:14:46.642
My Lord...

01:14:46.767 --> 01:14:48.477
no wonder you're
going out of business.

01:14:48.602 --> 01:14:49.728
It's... depressing.

01:14:49.853 --> 01:14:50.980
BOY:
Can I play over there?

01:14:51.063 --> 01:14:52.106
- Sure.
- What? No...

01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:53.232
Jack, please don't touch anything.

01:14:53.357 --> 01:14:55.819
Actually, ma'am, it's okay.

01:14:55.902 --> 01:14:57.445
He can play with anything he likes.

01:14:57.571 --> 01:15:00.282
Let me show you the
spiral staircases here.

01:15:00.407 --> 01:15:01.741
Do you know how it works?

01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:05.245
Okay, I'll show you.

01:15:07.455 --> 01:15:09.249
Cool. That's neat.

01:15:09.374 --> 01:15:11.626
Yeah...
It's a magnet.

01:15:11.710 --> 01:15:13.295
How does a magnet work?

01:15:13.378 --> 01:15:14.838
I don't know.

01:15:14.963 --> 01:15:16.131
It's, uh...

01:15:16.214 --> 01:15:18.383
Is it magic?

01:15:21.845 --> 01:15:23.848
Well...

01:15:23.973 --> 01:15:27.435
I believe it is.

01:15:30.354 --> 01:15:32.064
MAN:
...leads to the apartments upstairs.

01:15:32.148 --> 01:15:33.858
They're an excellent
source of income.

01:15:33.941 --> 01:15:36.068
Those planets and the rocket...

01:15:36.193 --> 01:15:37.612
I have to say-

01:15:37.737 --> 01:15:40.072
the use of this space is
completely impractical.

01:15:40.156 --> 01:15:42.200
It...

01:15:42.325 --> 01:15:44.535
it wasn't built for practicality.

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:46.245
Oh.

01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:49.540
Well, it certainly is a large
enough space for the price.

01:15:49.624 --> 01:15:51.417
Are the fixtures included?

01:15:51.542 --> 01:15:55.172
Yeah- the cash register...

01:15:55.297 --> 01:15:58.383
the slide, the tree,
the planets,

01:15:58.467 --> 01:16:02.137
the rocket ship,
the Door of Rooms...

01:16:02.262 --> 01:16:03.472
Okay!

01:16:03.597 --> 01:16:05.098
Great.

01:16:05.182 --> 01:16:06.850
Well, I'll let you know.

01:16:06.975 --> 01:16:08.894
Okay, Jack, honey?

01:16:09.019 --> 01:16:10.854
- Come on, we're leaving.
- Mom, you gotta see this!

01:16:10.938 --> 01:16:13.190
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

01:16:13.273 --> 01:16:15.567
Mommy's got a lot of
other properties to see.

01:16:15.692 --> 01:16:17.694
Rub that in.
Okay.

01:16:17.778 --> 01:16:19.112
We'll be in touch.

01:16:19.238 --> 01:16:21.533
JACK: Mommy, it's magic!

01:16:47.976 --> 01:16:49.270
Eric?

01:16:49.353 --> 01:16:52.147
I'm here to make you a
substantial offer for the store.

01:16:52.231 --> 01:16:53.691
What?

01:16:53.816 --> 01:16:57.278
Although I am unable to offer
the full amount and I'm nine,

01:16:57.403 --> 01:17:00.155
I think you may be interested
in my proposal.

01:17:02.241 --> 01:17:03.784
The following simply states

01:17:03.909 --> 01:17:07.413
that I can offer Mahoney
a down payment

01:17:07.538 --> 01:17:10.249
of $237 in pennies,

01:17:10.374 --> 01:17:13.294
nickels, dimes and a Christmas
check from my grandma.

01:17:13.419 --> 01:17:16.463
And then I am willing
to pay you

01:17:16.547 --> 01:17:18.049
my allowance
and a hefty percentage

01:17:18.174 --> 01:17:20.719
of the store's profit
on a weekly basis.

01:17:20.844 --> 01:17:22.762
Keep in mind that my age
works as a benefit,

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:25.432
as it means that I have
more weeks left

01:17:25.515 --> 01:17:27.642
in my life than
the typical buyer,

01:17:27.767 --> 01:17:29.686
which means more allowances.

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:30.979
Why are you doing this?

01:17:31.104 --> 01:17:32.647
I...

01:17:32.772 --> 01:17:34.441
want to get into
the real estate game.

01:17:34.566 --> 01:17:36.568
Flip a few properties,

01:17:36.693 --> 01:17:38.445
make my mark on the city.

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:39.946
Eric...

01:17:40.071 --> 01:17:41.907
The only thing we can invest in

01:17:42.032 --> 01:17:43.283
- is the future.
- Buddy...

01:17:43.408 --> 01:17:44.326
- I want to...
- Eric.

01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:47.246
Stop.

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:52.293
I don't want someone else
to have the store, all right?

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:54.503
I don't want it to change.

01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:56.130
Okay. All right.

01:17:56.255 --> 01:17:58.132
I'll throw in my hat collection.

01:17:58.216 --> 01:17:59.800
Don't throw in your hat collection.

01:17:59.926 --> 01:18:01.469
But there has to be something.

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:04.180
Please.

01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:07.642
She's about to make
a terrible mistake, Mutant.

01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:11.479
We can't let her do that.

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:13.982
As my friend...

01:18:15.943 --> 01:18:20.739
...help me... please.

01:18:51.104 --> 01:18:53.648
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:18:55.441 --> 01:18:56.943
Wow.

01:18:57.026 --> 01:18:59.070
What happened in here?

01:18:59.153 --> 01:19:03.199
I don't think you'd understand.

01:19:03.324 --> 01:19:05.994
Well, I've got news.

01:19:06.077 --> 01:19:07.453
Yeah?

01:19:07.579 --> 01:19:09.372
You've got an offer on the store.

01:19:09.497 --> 01:19:13.085
It's a good offer.
Cash offer.

01:19:13.210 --> 01:19:15.754
From the lady earlier today.

01:19:15.838 --> 01:19:17.965
Wow.

01:19:18.048 --> 01:19:19.216
I know it's late,

01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:20.426
but the woman's very aggressive.

01:19:20.551 --> 01:19:22.344
I thought you should
look it over tonight

01:19:22.469 --> 01:19:24.513
and come up with a decision
by tomorrow morning.

01:19:24.597 --> 01:19:26.557
Okay.

01:19:29.393 --> 01:19:30.769
Do you think I should take it?

01:19:30.895 --> 01:19:33.022
Well...

01:19:33.147 --> 01:19:34.899
Do you think I should take it?

01:19:34.982 --> 01:19:38.152
In my professional opinion,

01:19:38.277 --> 01:19:40.322
it is a very unique offer

01:19:40.447 --> 01:19:42.657
and it's a lot more
than we expected.

01:19:42.782 --> 01:19:44.492
I-I... I think
you'd be a fool

01:19:44.618 --> 01:19:47.370
not to take it.

01:19:49.206 --> 01:19:52.792
But I am not here as a professional.

01:19:54.878 --> 01:19:57.130
I'm here as your friend.

01:19:57.255 --> 01:19:59.424
And I think
you should keep the store.

01:19:59.507 --> 01:20:01.301
You don't even believe
in this store.

01:20:01.384 --> 01:20:03.053
- No, but...
- I... I can't.

01:20:03.136 --> 01:20:06.473
I want to, but I just can't.

01:20:06.556 --> 01:20:07.934
You "just" can't.

01:20:08.017 --> 01:20:11.812
Yeah. I guess not.

01:20:11.938 --> 01:20:13.773
What do you got there?

01:20:13.856 --> 01:20:15.399
Oh, it's the Congreve Cube.

01:20:15.524 --> 01:20:19.445
It's supposed to help me unlock
some great mystery or something.

01:20:19.570 --> 01:20:22.657
- Looks like a block of wood.
- It is.

01:20:22.782 --> 01:20:25.117
Are you supposed to unlock
a mystery with a block of wood?

01:20:25.201 --> 01:20:26.827
It's a magical
block of wood, Mutant.

01:20:26.911 --> 01:20:29.205
It's a block of wood that
probably, in the right hands,

01:20:29.288 --> 01:20:31.874
would reveal some greatness that...

01:20:31.999 --> 01:20:33.751
we can't even imagine.

01:20:33.876 --> 01:20:35.336
That's impossible.

01:20:35.461 --> 01:20:37.673
This is what you don't understand.

01:20:37.756 --> 01:20:39.258
What you have somehow missed.

01:20:39.341 --> 01:20:40.801
Every minute

01:20:40.884 --> 01:20:43.720
of every day in every corner
of this store,

01:20:43.804 --> 01:20:45.722
what happened was the impossible.

01:20:45.806 --> 01:20:47.307
Do you honestly
believe all that stuff?

01:20:47.432 --> 01:20:48.934
- Yes!
- That this store was magic?

01:20:49.059 --> 01:20:50.394
You never saw it.

01:20:50.519 --> 01:20:52.187
That that block of wood is more
than just a block of wood?

01:20:52.271 --> 01:20:53.230
Absolutely.

01:20:53.355 --> 01:20:55.357
I believe it with my entire heart.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:57.985
But the disheartening truth

01:20:58.068 --> 01:21:00.404
is that only Mr. Magorium
could make it so.

01:21:00.487 --> 01:21:03.156
- Um...
- It was his Emporium, not mine.

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.909
- J-Just, uh...
- Look, I appreciate

01:21:05.034 --> 01:21:08.413
- you coming here, but it's over.
- Say that thing

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:10.623
about that block of wood
that's not magic.

01:21:10.748 --> 01:21:12.458
It is magic.

01:21:12.542 --> 01:21:15.253
- What is wrong with you, Mutant?
- Say it one more time,

01:21:15.336 --> 01:21:16.921
that that's more
than just a block of wood.

01:21:17.046 --> 01:21:21.134
It is absolutely more
than just a block of woo...

01:21:21.259 --> 01:21:23.177
Well, it moves, for one thing.

01:21:25.597 --> 01:21:27.640
Move.

01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:32.145
Come on, you can
do better than that.

01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:33.439
Move!

01:21:36.483 --> 01:21:38.110
All right.
Don't worry.

01:21:38.235 --> 01:21:41.363
If you fall, I'll just
pick you right back up.

01:21:41.488 --> 01:21:42.656
Move.

01:22:33.417 --> 01:22:35.336
No way.

01:22:40.091 --> 01:22:41.884
ERIC:
This chapter is called

01:22:42.009 --> 01:22:44.470
"You Have to Believe It to See It...

01:22:44.554 --> 01:22:47.056
Or Messing with the Mutant. "

01:22:51.727 --> 01:22:53.646
MAHONEY Mutant.

01:22:53.729 --> 01:22:55.314
Mutant.

01:22:55.398 --> 01:22:56.774
You gotta wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

01:22:56.899 --> 01:22:58.986
There are people here.

01:22:59.111 --> 01:23:00.779
Mm... What?

01:23:00.904 --> 01:23:04.241
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.

01:23:04.324 --> 01:23:05.576
Hi.

01:23:05.659 --> 01:23:06.952
Morning.

01:23:07.035 --> 01:23:08.287
I'm sorry
to wake you up,

01:23:08.412 --> 01:23:09.663
but you've slept long enough.

01:23:09.788 --> 01:23:11.248
What's wrong with your head?

01:23:11.331 --> 01:23:12.874
It hurts.
I hit it pretty hard.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.084
You did?

01:23:14.167 --> 01:23:15.711
Yeah, it must've been
when I passed out.

01:23:15.836 --> 01:23:17.170
What do you mean?

01:23:17.296 --> 01:23:19.089
When I keeled over.

01:23:19.214 --> 01:23:20.465
I didn't see that.

01:23:20.591 --> 01:23:22.092
Yes, you did.
Last night.

01:23:22.217 --> 01:23:23.802
Last night?
I went home.

01:23:23.886 --> 01:23:26.054
No, no, before...

01:23:26.138 --> 01:23:27.932
I passed out.

01:23:28.016 --> 01:23:30.351
I think you must be confused.

01:23:30.435 --> 01:23:31.644
No, no.

01:23:31.728 --> 01:23:33.646
I passed out.
I remember.

01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:35.064
It was after the cube flew.

01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:37.567
- What cube?
- "What cube?"

01:23:41.362 --> 01:23:43.406
Mahoney.
The Congreve Cube.

01:23:43.531 --> 01:23:45.658
You made it fly all around the room.

01:23:45.783 --> 01:23:47.493
I think you must
have dreamt all that.

01:23:47.619 --> 01:23:49.954
I left you here to finalize
the real estate paperwork.

01:23:50.079 --> 01:23:51.831
- Maybe you got sleepy.
- No, no, no, no.

01:23:51.915 --> 01:23:53.666
I-I-I didn't.
Positively not.

01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:56.170
I passed out
after you made that cube fly.

01:23:56.295 --> 01:23:57.713
It doesn't matter.

01:23:57.796 --> 01:24:00.216
- I'm selling the store.
- What?

01:24:00.341 --> 01:24:02.092
Yeah, remember the offer?

01:24:02.176 --> 01:24:03.719
We're signing the deal this morning.

01:24:03.802 --> 01:24:04.929
No, no. Hey, hey.
You can't.

01:24:05.012 --> 01:24:06.055
Why can't I?

01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:08.349
Because this, it's...
it's magic!

01:24:08.432 --> 01:24:09.683
You really think
this store is magic?

01:24:09.767 --> 01:24:11.310
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:24:11.435 --> 01:24:13.812
Isn't that just a little
difficult to believe?

01:24:13.896 --> 01:24:15.814
No, no, I don't...
I don't think so.

01:24:15.898 --> 01:24:16.815
No, not at all.

01:24:16.941 --> 01:24:18.400
Now...

01:24:18.484 --> 01:24:22.488
I believe that you can make it
be anything that you want.

01:24:23.864 --> 01:24:25.283
It's you.

01:24:25.367 --> 01:24:27.077
You...

01:24:27.202 --> 01:24:28.411
are a block of wood.

01:24:28.495 --> 01:24:30.413
I'm a block of wood?

01:24:30.538 --> 01:24:32.040
Yeah, Mahoney. It's you.

01:24:32.165 --> 01:24:34.960
And what you need to
believe in is not the cube,

01:24:35.043 --> 01:24:38.004
and it's not the store,
and it's not me.

01:24:38.088 --> 01:24:41.091
What you need to believe in is you.

01:24:44.678 --> 01:24:47.389
Holy cow.

01:24:47.514 --> 01:24:49.808
What is it?

01:24:49.849 --> 01:24:52.018
A sparkle.

01:25:29.433 --> 01:25:31.810
- Wow!
- Cool.

01:26:06.179 --> 01:26:08.890
Whoa...

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.312
Whoa!

01:27:24.176 --> 01:27:26.470
- I can't believe it.
- Incredible.

01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:33.185
ERIC: And that's how
Molly Mahoney's story began.

01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:49.703
# You don't know
what you're becoming #

01:27:51.705 --> 01:27:54.791
# Who knows what
you're gonna be #

01:27:56.501 --> 01:27:59.630
# We don't know
where we're going #

01:28:01.256 --> 01:28:04.134
# We don't know
'cause we can't see #

01:28:06.303 --> 01:28:09.056
# If I could tell your future #

01:28:10.974 --> 01:28:13.895
# I'd say love
the world you find #

01:28:16.147 --> 01:28:19.317
# In the dark times
and the hard questions #

01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:23.738
# Let some sunshine
in your mind #

01:28:26.324 --> 01:28:28.534
# Sun is rising #

01:28:30.995 --> 01:28:33.456
# And I think that's good #

01:28:36.209 --> 01:28:38.920
# Just now realizing #

01:28:42.258 --> 01:28:47.596
# Some things you never
thought you were #

01:33:00.608 --> 01:33:02.610
What do you think, Milo?

01:33:02.694 --> 01:33:03.570
Not bad.

01:33:03.653 --> 01:33:04.612
Thank you.
