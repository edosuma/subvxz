Screenplay by Nam Nai-choi

03:16.739 --> 03:18.282
Here we are.

04:09.459 --> 04:12.587
You, step out,
report your name and make it loud.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.632
My name's Yip Ming.

04:16.716 --> 04:18.760
Yip Ming, 37 years old,

04:18.843 --> 04:22.847
sentenced to serve seven years
for robbery and assault.

04:24.015 --> 04:25.475
Go on!

04:30.271 --> 04:32.482
Go over there!

04:32.565 --> 04:34.609
Next! Hurry up.

04:37.862 --> 04:39.572
My name is Lee Shan.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.699
Lee Shan, 2S years old,

04:41.783 --> 04:45.912
sentenced to serve five years
for stealing from his company.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.538
Go on.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.250
Stand over there!

04:52.210 --> 04:53.836
Next!

04:53.920 --> 04:55.797
Ricky Ho.

04:59.175 --> 05:00.635
Come forward.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.766
Ricky Ho, 21 years old,

05:06.849 --> 05:10.895
sentenced to serve ten years
for manslaughter and assault.

05:13.815 --> 05:16.359
Hey! I didn't say you could go.

05:16.442 --> 05:18.194
He's carrying a weapon!

05:54.897 --> 05:56.732
Release him.

06:01.737 --> 06:04.949
Why didn't you let the doctors
take the bullets out?

06:05.032 --> 06:08.411
- They're souvenirs.
- Take those three away first.

06:17.879 --> 06:21.048
The warden is the most
powerful person here.

06:21.132 --> 06:24.010
After him it's the assistant warden.

06:25.052 --> 06:30.308
The prison is divided into four
wings - north, south, east and west.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.352
They're controlled
by the Gang of Four.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.230
You've only just arrived,

06:36.314 --> 06:40.526
so none <i>of</i> you can meet
the warden or assistant warden yet.

06:40.610 --> 06:44.739
But you must know the rules here.

06:46.073 --> 06:49.035
Goddammit! why do I have
to get up so early?

06:54.874 --> 06:57.168
Captain, that's my towel.

07:12.725 --> 07:15.811
- Do you want to fight?!
- Samuel's bullying people again.

07:15.895 --> 07:18.022
He's the captain of the cell block.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.400
- He's friends with the guards, too.
- What can you do?

07:23.277 --> 07:25.363
On your knees and apologise!

07:31.619 --> 07:33.704
This little train is very cute!

07:38.000 --> 07:41.379
I made that out of wood.
It's for my kid.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.423
It's for your kid.

07:44.507 --> 07:49.053
That's right. I hear your probation's
coming through.

07:51.347 --> 07:52.556
Really?

07:55.601 --> 07:57.979
Without my approval, there's no
probation.

07:58.062 --> 08:02.066
You better watch yourself if you know
what's good for you.

08:04.986 --> 08:07.613
Samuel, you bastard!

08:21.460 --> 08:22.712
What's going on?

08:22.795 --> 08:26.298
Sir, the clumsy old fool fell down on
the floor.

08:26.382 --> 08:29.635
He just fell over right on top of that
plane.

08:30.845 --> 08:33.681
He's groaning like a pig. What a
nuisance!

08:36.225 --> 08:39.270
Stop screaming and watch your step.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.814
What's your hurry, old fool?

08:45.317 --> 08:46.694
Captain, are we leaving?

08:46.777 --> 08:49.739
- We haven't brushed our teeth yet.
- Who cares?

08:53.826 --> 08:55.244
Captain!

08:57.288 --> 08:59.457
What do we do now?

09:00.207 --> 09:02.710
Bastard, you're asking for it!

09:03.878 --> 09:05.755
Are you talking to me?

09:21.103 --> 09:23.939
Breakfast. Here's breakfast.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.942
Captain, drink some milk.

09:35.409 --> 09:39.371
How am I supposed to drink it? There's
no straw. Stupid fool!

09:41.540 --> 09:45.753
Goddammit! Bastard! How dare he pick on
me!

09:45.836 --> 09:49.340
I'll let him know why I'm called the
North-wing Killer!

09:49.423 --> 09:53.094
Captain, why don't we get Mad Dragon to
take care of him?

09:53.177 --> 09:55.930
- Mad Dragon?!
- That's a good idea.

09:56.013 --> 09:58.557
Other day.
Mad Dragon ate the warden's horse the

09:58.641 --> 10:00.643
He's still in isolation.

10:05.689 --> 10:08.067
When will Mad Dragon be let out?

10:09.110 --> 10:10.694
What about tomorrow?

10:11.695 --> 10:15.324
You can have my allowance for this
month as a reward.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.743
All right! I happen to be broke.

10:20.538 --> 10:25.126
Watch out, Mad Dragon makes trouble
every time he's out.

10:25.209 --> 10:28.003
If he's real bad, I won't take the
blame.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.174
Don't worry.

11:11.172 --> 11:12.298
Me?

11:22.266 --> 11:26.312
What's that? They rejected my
probation?!

11:26.395 --> 11:27.897
The captain told me...

11:27.980 --> 11:30.231
Did you send a letter home secretly?

11:30.232 --> 11:32.776
No, I didn't. I didn't do that.

11:33.194 --> 11:36.238
- I didn't, sir.
- You didn't, my ass!

11:37.531 --> 11:39.491
You're lying!

11:40.492 --> 11:43.454
Sir, believe me, I'm not lying.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.915
I want to go home to see my wife and
kids.

11:46.916 --> 11:50.628
I haven't stopped dreaming about them
since my first day here.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.965
- That's enough.
- Please stop!

11:55.591 --> 11:57.259
You're unlucky.

11:59.178 --> 12:00.930
Sir, wait!

12:02.431 --> 12:06.518
Please! Wait, sir!

12:30.000 --> 12:32.628
Old man Ma hanged himself!

12:35.714 --> 12:40.386
One of Samuel's men grassed him up. So
the warden rejected his probation.

12:40.469 --> 12:45.349
- He's really unlucky.
- He was a model citizen.

12:45.432 --> 12:50.104
When he was rushing his pregnant wife
to hospital, he ran someone over.

12:50.187 --> 12:54.984
It should have been a traffic offence,
but the guy was a cop,

12:55.067 --> 12:58.696
so they gave him a long sentence and
sent him here.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.848
Ricky, why are you here?

13:42.990 --> 13:46.201
He's dead already. Take his handcuffs
off!

13:48.203 --> 13:50.080
Ricky, take it easy.

14:54.353 --> 14:57.231
Time's up. Come on, come on.

14:58.399 --> 14:59.858
Hurry up!

15:00.692 --> 15:02.653
All right, next batch!

15:04.279 --> 15:07.950
You have 15 minutes to do your laundry
or take a shit.

15:27.428 --> 15:28.762
Ricky.

15:34.726 --> 15:40.190
Someone gave me 30 pounds of rice to
turn you into mincemeat.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.988
Do you think you can do it?

15:46.071 --> 15:49.074
Go on, get him. Of course you'll beat
him.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.406
Stop fighting!

16:32.534 --> 16:34.328
He killed both of them!

16:34.411 --> 16:37.915
Me.
Another move and I'll hit you. Follow

16:42.127 --> 16:44.755
- Can't you take a shower in peace?
- Sir!

16:44.838 --> 16:47.674
I want to talk to that kid, all right?

16:55.349 --> 16:56.600
You're not bad.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.394
- I don't think we've met.
- Me neither.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.361
I'm head <i>of</i> the North Wing Gang of Four.

17:07.444 --> 17:11.740
As your leader, after the assistant
warden's punished you,

17:11.823 --> 17:14.201
I'll see you are disciplined here.

17:34.763 --> 17:38.183
We'll take you to see the assistant
warden tomorrow.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.907
"Here Lies Ho Do-wong"

18:39.870 --> 18:42.080
You are Mr Ho's son, Ricky.

18:42.914 --> 18:44.374
You are...?

18:46.835 --> 18:48.754
I'm Uncle Ghost.

18:49.671 --> 18:56.345
Even when you were a child, you had
superhuman strength.

18:56.428 --> 18:59.431
I've been keeping an eye on you since
then.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.860
You're no longer a child, do you still
have your super strength?

19:11.943 --> 19:13.445
I'm much stronger now.

19:15.697 --> 19:18.116
Why don't you show me just how strong?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.701
All right.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.768
Uncle Ghost, watch out!

19:48.480 --> 19:52.734
- That hurt!
- You're still as clumsy as always.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.162
You know chi gung!

20:04.705 --> 20:08.625
Uncle, I want to learn chi gung so I
can help poor people.

20:18.885 --> 20:22.472
Chi gung requires strong emotional
control.

20:37.863 --> 20:41.992
Remember, chi gung accumulates energy
in the body

20:42.075 --> 20:46.121
and turns the body into a natural
shield against all attack.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.969
When you have energy, you should be
able to use it.

21:01.052 --> 21:05.348
Call forth your energy and break this
headstone with your arms and legs.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.350
Watch this first.

21:13.815 --> 21:17.527
Now I want you to practise using your
strength.

21:41.343 --> 21:45.430
Ricky, take advantage of your strength.

21:46.807 --> 21:50.894
Now you'll become stronger when your
enemy is stronger than you.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.854
Give it a try.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.118
Good.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.504
The assistant warden wants you.

22:57.085 --> 22:58.587
The prisoner's here.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.340
Bring him in.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.522
Hold it.

23:22.944 --> 23:24.446
Read me his report.

23:27.240 --> 23:33.121
Ricky Ho, aged 21, blood type AB,
parents unknown,

23:33.204 --> 23:35.123
brought up in an orphanage.

23:35.206 --> 23:38.168
He didn't do well in either primary or
high school.

23:38.251 --> 23:41.713
He joined a music school to learn the
flute

23:41.796 --> 23:44.633
and then disappeared for two years.

23:48.511 --> 23:52.057
During those two years he was seen
fighting on the streets.

23:52.140 --> 23:56.269
He murdered a man and was sentenced for
the crime.

23:56.353 --> 23:59.606
The report also says he is extremely
dangerous.

24:03.026 --> 24:04.569
That's it.

24:18.708 --> 24:22.504
Where were you for those two years?
What did you do?

24:30.095 --> 24:32.222
Come on. Tell me!

24:37.811 --> 24:40.313
Why do you have bullets in your chest?

24:47.070 --> 24:50.824
You still have a while to go, you'll
tell me eventually.

24:54.202 --> 24:57.372
We got a letter for you this morning.

24:57.455 --> 24:59.749
There's a photograph inside.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.670
Come here and take a look.

25:15.473 --> 25:20.895
Don't you ever play me for a dummy.
I'll show you what I'm made of.

25:24.065 --> 25:25.525
I want to see how tough

25:25.608 --> 25:29.070
the man who killed Mad Dragon and
Samuel really is.

25:32.991 --> 25:36.326
You're used to this. Are you a trained
killer?

25:36.327 --> 25:37.495
Tell me!

25:39.914 --> 25:43.500
Ricky, don't tell me you're a special
agent.

25:43.501 --> 25:46.838
But if that is the case, I can help
you out.

25:46.921 --> 25:49.174
I arranged an accidental death once

25:49.257 --> 25:51.760
for a prisoner suspected <i>of</i> espionage.

25:57.807 --> 26:01.227
You asshole! You messed it all up. I
tried to be nice.

26:01.311 --> 26:02.812
I can kill you right now!

26:04.397 --> 26:06.941
Or I'll have fun with your girlfriend.

26:07.525 --> 26:11.738
She's very pretty. Let me bring her
back here, and then I'll...

26:40.391 --> 26:43.686
You want me to fight back, don't you?!

26:44.479 --> 26:47.398
Look, don't be stupid.

26:47.482 --> 26:50.567
The warden isn't around, so I'm in
charge here.

26:50.568 --> 26:53.571
If you touch me, you're a dead man.

27:14.968 --> 27:16.511
Ricky!

27:20.098 --> 27:22.809
How dare you! I won't forget this.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.980
Keep your nose out <i>of</i> my affairs.

27:30.608 --> 27:33.486
He can hurt people without even
touching them.

27:33.570 --> 27:36.281
What kind <i>of</i> a demon is he?

28:30.376 --> 28:33.504
- Let me try!
- OK, come on.

28:36.049 --> 28:38.384
Let me do it myself.

28:52.565 --> 28:54.275
Ying, look.

29:01.282 --> 29:05.536
"Ying is Like a Firefly Lighting Up
the Night"

29:12.710 --> 29:14.170
Come on.

29:25.431 --> 29:28.518
What time do you think it is?! Stop
that noise!

29:53.209 --> 29:56.795
'He's a real playboy, he's got lots of
lovers

29:56.796 --> 30:00.925
'But he doesn't know if he needs to go
to the toilet'

30:23.781 --> 30:26.783
- Hold it! What's this about?
- Stop acting dumb.

30:26.784 --> 30:31.164
- How many guys have you grassed on?
- No way, I'm no grass.

30:31.789 --> 30:34.459
You had old Ma killed, you
son-of-a-bitch!

30:34.542 --> 30:37.420
I swear to God, I didn't do anything!

30:37.503 --> 30:39.839
Kuang, the asshole's lying.

30:41.507 --> 30:46.262
Listen, I know you're pissed off. I'll
do anything.

30:52.018 --> 30:55.688
- Right, you asshole, listen up.
- First, eat shit.

30:55.772 --> 30:58.107
And then lick our shoes clean.

30:58.316 --> 31:01.361
And... Kuang, what do you want?

31:02.278 --> 31:06.199
And then I cut you into little pieces
and feed you to the dogs!

31:06.282 --> 31:08.451
Kuang, are you serious?

31:09.660 --> 31:12.955
No! I beg you, please!

31:14.499 --> 31:16.084
Kuang!

31:25.510 --> 31:27.053
Hai.

31:27.845 --> 31:30.348
- Please help me.
- Piss off!

31:31.099 --> 31:33.559
Kuang, don't go too far.

31:33.643 --> 31:37.146
<i>If</i> you kill him, what do we say to
Cyclops?

31:38.731 --> 31:43.110
Him, we won't take it any more.
Hai, lots of men have died because of

31:43.111 --> 31:46.739
Don't tell me you've forgotten who
does the punishing here.

31:46.823 --> 31:48.408
You should know that.

31:49.033 --> 31:53.162
Kuang, I want you to tell everyone the
rules of the North Wing

31:53.246 --> 31:55.498
just one more time.

31:56.958 --> 32:01.212
In the North Wing, only you, Hai, can
punish people.

32:02.672 --> 32:06.551
Let Ba Chu go and forget about the old
man, all right?

32:09.846 --> 32:11.305
Hai.

32:11.389 --> 32:13.808
Why let him walk away like the others?

32:13.891 --> 32:17.437
You don't punish them either. what's
the point of rules?

32:17.812 --> 32:21.190
If you're not fair, how can we respect
you?

32:35.204 --> 32:38.332
You disrespect me, that's against the
rules.

32:43.921 --> 32:45.756
Hai, well done!

32:53.514 --> 32:55.766
I'll take care <i>of</i> him now.

33:00.938 --> 33:03.357
You asked for it, bastard!

33:13.367 --> 33:14.702
What about Kuang?

33:20.082 --> 33:22.627
I'll use him as bait to get Ricky.

33:24.462 --> 33:26.339
I don't follow you.

33:29.217 --> 33:32.428
You must teach the prisoners in your
wing a lesson!

33:33.304 --> 33:36.057
<i>If</i> they all act like Ricky, I'll be
damned!

33:40.436 --> 33:42.063
Hai!

33:49.904 --> 33:53.533
I'll let you use the knife to enforce
the rules.

34:03.501 --> 34:05.753
Do you want some mints?

34:09.382 --> 34:10.841
Hai!

34:11.509 --> 34:14.136
I want a good show, all right?

34:40.621 --> 34:44.792
You're pretty good, it's too bad you
don't follow the rules.

34:45.626 --> 34:49.880
You may be tough, but I must protect
the Gang of Four's reputation,

34:49.964 --> 34:52.341
so I'm going to finish you off today!

35:04.645 --> 35:07.898
- Why don't you fight back?
- I want you to be fair.

35:07.982 --> 35:10.610
Let Kuang go. Then I'll fight.

35:14.822 --> 35:17.241
I make the rules, you got that?

35:19.827 --> 35:22.913
When Hai shows his tattoo, he has to
kill! You must fight.

35:22.997 --> 35:26.500
Ricky! If you don't, Kuang will die
for sure. Go on!

35:26.584 --> 35:29.503
- Go on, Ricky!
- You can do it!

35:29.587 --> 35:31.672
- Go on!
- Go on!

35:46.562 --> 35:48.939
That's a present from Cyclops.

35:49.023 --> 35:52.526
Let's see <i>if</i> you're as strong when
you're blind!

36:06.707 --> 36:10.169
Well, blind man, your arm's gone now.

36:10.252 --> 36:13.631
Ricky, you're finished.

36:20.346 --> 36:23.808
- Ricky! How are you?
- Are you all right?

36:31.857 --> 36:34.068
There's a fight in the North Wing.

36:34.151 --> 36:36.612
I hear Hai's fighting Ricky.

36:36.696 --> 36:39.323
- Has anyone been killed yet?
- Let's go!

36:41.075 --> 36:42.660
- Well done!
- Come on!

36:48.541 --> 36:51.669
So you can still see,
but your right arm's crippled.

36:51.752 --> 36:53.462
You've had it.

37:09.812 --> 37:11.522
What's he doing?

37:25.703 --> 37:27.788
He just fixed his right arm!

37:30.666 --> 37:32.668
Ricky, you're the best.

37:36.130 --> 37:37.798
Hai, don't be stupid.

37:39.717 --> 37:41.844
We'll die together.

37:49.059 --> 37:51.812
Hai, you really live up
to your reputation.

37:52.980 --> 37:54.857
Do I have to kill you, Hai?

38:10.790 --> 38:12.792
- Well done!
- He's dead.

38:16.003 --> 38:18.631
- Ricky, well done!
- Ricky, well done!

38:31.393 --> 38:33.521
That's unbelievable!

38:46.700 --> 38:49.829
- Kuang! Kuang!
- He's dead!

38:49.912 --> 38:51.997
- He's dead.
- Look at him.

38:52.081 --> 38:54.750
- Kuang.
- Kuang!

38:58.128 --> 38:59.672
They taste awful today!

39:00.256 --> 39:02.675
Cyclops! You're behind all this!

39:02.758 --> 39:05.302
Let's kill the bastard!
Avenge Kuang's death!

39:05.386 --> 39:06.929
Get him!

39:09.056 --> 39:11.642
- Get him!
- What are you doing?

39:11.725 --> 39:14.979
Stop that!
Have you forgotten the Gang of Four?

39:15.563 --> 39:18.858
We have Ricky on our side.
We fear no one, not even you.

39:18.941 --> 39:20.484
We want to kill you!

39:33.455 --> 39:35.916
Ricky, I'd like you to meet
some people.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.669
This is the head <i>of</i> the West Wing,
Wong Chun...

39:39.837 --> 39:44.508
head of the East Wing, Tarzan,
and from the South Wing, White God.

39:45.509 --> 39:49.221
<i>If</i> you're really tough,
let's see you take on these three.

39:49.305 --> 39:52.850
Come on, Ricky.
We can help you. Get him!

39:52.933 --> 39:54.268
Ricky, come on!

39:55.352 --> 39:57.563
- Where are you going?
- Ricky!

39:58.355 --> 39:59.982
- Ricky!
- Ricky.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.191
Ricky, let's kill those swines!

40:02.192 --> 40:05.404
Let's avenge Kuang's death
and finish those suckers.

40:05.487 --> 40:09.533
Go back to your wings. Kuang and Hai
are both dead. Isn't that enough?

40:18.959 --> 40:23.631
Ricky, do you want to join
the Gang <i>of</i> Four?

40:31.388 --> 40:36.518
- It's Sa. He's Hai's godson.
- Hai's dead. He must feel terrible.

41:29.071 --> 41:33.075
Not like that. Blow a little lighter
and roll your tongue back.

41:54.722 --> 41:57.099
Hai's dead, you must be very sad.

42:05.482 --> 42:07.568
Someone cut off your tongue?!

42:32.968 --> 42:38.015
Hey! Try playing this.
It has a better sound.

43:45.791 --> 43:48.252
Where did you get these poppy leaves?

43:55.968 --> 43:57.970
That's the West Wing.

44:10.149 --> 44:11.900
What's the matter?

44:19.032 --> 44:20.909
Sa told Ricky about the poppies.

44:23.036 --> 44:25.330
What? But Sa is a mute.

44:26.373 --> 44:30.377
You think I'm lying? Sa's with Ricky,
he's working against us now.

44:30.460 --> 44:32.629
- Don't you know that?
- That's enough.

44:32.713 --> 44:34.256
Do you have evidence?

44:34.339 --> 44:38.635
If he's really betrayed us,
nobody will be able to save him.

44:42.639 --> 44:46.018
- Sa!
- Take it easy.

45:03.118 --> 45:05.495
Sa, this knife belonged to Hai.

45:05.579 --> 45:08.874
The rules state
that kin must avenge the deceased.

45:08.957 --> 45:11.210
Take this and get rid of Ricky.

45:25.641 --> 45:31.480
Look what Ricky did to Hai. Don't you
think you should avenge his death?

45:42.074 --> 45:43.533
Traitor!

45:48.121 --> 45:50.707
This time we won't
just cut off your tongue.

46:06.390 --> 46:08.934
Isn't that Sa?
What happened to him?

46:09.017 --> 46:10.894
- Is that him?
- Yes.

46:11.561 --> 46:14.356
His skin's been peeled off.

46:14.439 --> 46:18.068
It must have been Wong Chun.

46:20.028 --> 46:21.697
Sa's really unlucky.

46:21.780 --> 46:24.700
When he saw something
he shouldn't have,

46:24.783 --> 46:26.618
Wong Chun cut off his tongue.

46:27.744 --> 46:31.039
- Now look what's happened to him.
- What did Sa see?

46:31.915 --> 46:35.877
Forget it, Ricky, you don't want to
mess with Wong Chun, do you?

46:38.588 --> 46:40.632
But Sa knew what would happen.

46:40.716 --> 46:45.429
After Hai's death, it was only
a matter <i>of</i> time before they got him.

47:26.386 --> 47:28.430
Bastard!

47:33.602 --> 47:37.439
What?! Ricky knows about the poppies?

47:37.773 --> 47:41.360
Wong Chun, don't you know how
to do your job?!

47:55.791 --> 47:57.626
West Wing's on fire!

48:04.925 --> 48:08.970
Goddammit! How could this be?!
Who lit the fire?

48:13.850 --> 48:16.103
Shit! They're burning everything.

48:22.484 --> 48:24.694
Bastard! Why are you growing opium?

48:25.487 --> 48:27.571
So it was you who started the fire.

48:27.572 --> 48:30.700
I'm going to kill you
to avenge Sa's death.

48:37.999 --> 48:41.503
- The West Wing is on fire.
- what's burning?

48:44.631 --> 48:46.425
What's that strange smell?

48:46.508 --> 48:49.719
That bastard Wong Chun
is growing opium in his cell.

48:52.389 --> 48:56.685
Squeeze the juice from the poppy,
dry it and you get opium...

48:57.477 --> 48:59.563
which claims so many innocent lives!

48:59.646 --> 49:03.483
Damn you! You destroyed my hard work.
I'll kill you for that.

49:09.906 --> 49:12.409
His kung fu is unorthodox.

49:31.011 --> 49:34.848
I've hit your death spot,
you'll soon be a dead man.

49:57.162 --> 50:00.332
Let's burn down the prison,
then we can escape.

50:16.473 --> 50:19.643
I want you to go
and lock them up in their cells.

50:19.726 --> 50:21.269
Yes, sir.

50:22.187 --> 50:24.648
You... Just go!

50:24.731 --> 50:28.151
Sir, the fire department called
to see what's happening.

50:28.235 --> 50:31.238
Just tell them
that we're busy burning rubbish.

50:36.785 --> 50:39.079
Is the police department
on the phone now?

50:39.162 --> 50:41.915
It's the warden,
he's back from Hawaii tomorrow.

50:41.998 --> 50:44.334
What?! He's coming back?

50:46.962 --> 50:49.256
Damn! Why is he coming back so soon?

50:50.549 --> 50:52.259
Sound the Zero Alarm!

50:52.342 --> 50:56.096
I can't, sir. Ricky and Wong Chun
are still outside.

50:57.556 --> 50:59.099
Just follow my orders.

51:03.019 --> 51:07.774
A man looks his best just before
dying, especially a man like you.

51:07.857 --> 51:13.405
You pissed a lot of people off
by burning my work.

51:13.863 --> 51:16.908
The warden for one
will never forgive you.

51:26.251 --> 51:30.505
Ricky, try harder now.
You can defeat them.

51:53.278 --> 51:56.448
No wonder everyone's
been saying you're a demon,

51:56.531 --> 51:59.576
you can even overcome
my deadly strike.

51:59.659 --> 52:02.537
But even if you're safe right now,

52:02.621 --> 52:05.248
you'll never make it
through the night.

52:26.603 --> 52:28.813
Wong Chun, catch!

52:36.112 --> 52:38.406
All right, we'll cremate you.

52:43.662 --> 52:47.123
Ricky can't die yet.
I still haven't fought the bastard.

52:47.916 --> 52:50.001
Tarzan, are you out of your mind?

52:52.671 --> 52:56.174
'Zero Alarm warning, anyone
not in their cells in one minute

52:56.257 --> 52:57.550
'will be shot on sight.'

52:58.134 --> 53:01.513
Tarzan, we must kill Ricky now
and go back to the cells.

53:03.306 --> 53:07.018
Damn it, get out of my way
or I'll kill you as well.

53:11.231 --> 53:14.317
Bastard, you're really
pissing me off today.

53:27.831 --> 53:30.417
Ricky, let's have a duel right here.

54:00.697 --> 54:02.782
You're real lucky.

54:02.866 --> 54:05.285
I still have to show everyone
the opium.

54:12.417 --> 54:15.628
Once the cement dries off,
he won't be able to move.

54:38.485 --> 54:40.361
There goes the evidence.

54:41.070 --> 54:43.031
Clean the cement off Tarzan.

54:43.406 --> 54:48.453
As for Ricky Ho, after I deal with
the warden, I'll take care of him.

55:12.894 --> 55:16.940
Hey, I'm right here. No problem, OK.

55:46.219 --> 55:51.266
The warden's back, open the gate!
Open the gate!

55:51.349 --> 55:54.853
Get the gate, the warden's here!

55:55.979 --> 55:57.480
The warden's here.

56:00.024 --> 56:01.943
Get up! Get up!

56:03.653 --> 56:05.530
Stand up straight.

56:23.631 --> 56:25.717
Warden, welcome back.

56:41.524 --> 56:44.527
Well, how was Hawaii?

57:02.086 --> 57:03.421
Oh, my God!

57:04.380 --> 57:07.967
Are you hurt? Are you all right?

57:11.971 --> 57:13.473
Don't cry. It's OK.

57:18.603 --> 57:20.438
Who rolled out the carpet?

57:21.439 --> 57:23.900
Not me. Not me.

57:24.192 --> 57:27.320
- Sir, this man rolled it out.
- You?!

57:29.113 --> 57:31.741
It's not my fault. Let me go, please!

57:32.867 --> 57:36.829
Hey, why didn't you check the carpet
before we arrived?

57:37.330 --> 57:38.998
Where are your eyes?

57:46.255 --> 57:49.425
If you don't open your eyes,
what use are they?

58:04.440 --> 58:05.984
Come on.

58:09.904 --> 58:12.281
Anything happen while I was away?

58:14.617 --> 58:18.037
Some prisoners rebelled
and some prisoners died.

58:18.121 --> 58:21.541
They're dying every month.
What's wrong with you?

58:21.624 --> 58:23.501
Since the prison was privatised,

58:23.584 --> 58:28.089
the prisoners have become the
cheapest and the best labour force.

58:28.172 --> 58:32.968
You take good care of them now. Don't
let them die from hunger or illness.

58:32.969 --> 58:36.472
- He's eating a candle.
- Keep an eye on the prisoners!

58:40.184 --> 58:41.894
It's only candy.

58:46.649 --> 58:48.526
Is there anything else?

58:51.237 --> 58:56.909
Yes, sir. The opium stock...
a fire burnt it all.

58:57.493 --> 59:00.621
What? What happened? What happened?

59:05.209 --> 59:08.254
- Get my pills! Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.

59:10.548 --> 59:11.924
Here, sir.

59:45.875 --> 59:48.169
Warden, that's him.

59:59.680 --> 1:00:01.557
It's OK. Don't be scared.

1:00:19.826 --> 1:00:22.120
I've waited for you all night.

1:00:22.203 --> 1:00:26.791
- Kill him! Kill him, quick!
- Ricky, do you want to die?

1:00:27.416 --> 1:00:29.210
Is the opium stock yours?!

1:00:44.934 --> 1:00:46.853
Ricky, I want to fight you.

1:00:49.564 --> 1:00:51.482
Warden, have a seat.

1:00:52.400 --> 1:00:56.237
Tarzan is considered the best fighter
in the Gang <i>of</i> Four.

1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:58.656
Ricky's finished for sure now.

1:00:59.699 --> 1:01:02.618
He doesn't have my permission
to die yet.

1:01:02.702 --> 1:01:05.788
Warden, whatever you want.

1:01:24.140 --> 1:01:27.059
How dare you scare the warden?

1:01:29.562 --> 1:01:31.355
Good work!

1:01:33.900 --> 1:01:37.570
One, two, three, four...

1:01:37.653 --> 1:01:39.864
five...six!

1:01:42.617 --> 1:01:44.827
Well, how do you like that?

1:01:45.244 --> 1:01:48.915
- You hit like a girl.
- So you want some more, do you?!

1:01:53.794 --> 1:01:56.672
Warden, Tarzan used
to open coconuts this way.

1:01:56.756 --> 1:01:59.133
Ricky's head will explode any minute.

1:02:37.213 --> 1:02:42.009
Get up! You're really useless.
How could you just die like that?

1:02:42.093 --> 1:02:47.098
Shut up!
We're human beings, human beings!

1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:03.531
Looks like you're a real tough guy.

1:03:03.614 --> 1:03:06.534
No wonder you got into so much trouble
here.

1:03:07.326 --> 1:03:10.871
Bastard! You're growing opium and
killing innocent men!

1:03:10.955 --> 1:03:15.001
Ricky, what are you trying to find out
here? What do you want?

1:03:15.626 --> 1:03:19.880
He won't talk just yet. But when the
panel comes down...

1:03:39.191 --> 1:03:41.777
Not bad. Not bad.

1:03:42.403 --> 1:03:47.366
Ricky, you're putting up a pretty good
show, I'll join in for the fun.

1:03:48.659 --> 1:03:52.413
This is the latest stun gun with
100,000 volts.

1:04:09.972 --> 1:04:11.807
Soon you'll be a meat patty.

1:04:22.193 --> 1:04:24.111
You're still alive?!

1:04:25.321 --> 1:04:29.325
Warden, can't you see that I'm still
in here?

1:04:29.617 --> 1:04:33.704
- You're no good to me now.
I've been nothing but loyal to you.

1:04:33.788 --> 1:04:37.458
So what? You're no use to us now.
Give it up.

1:04:41.629 --> 1:04:43.172
Tarzan, come on out!

1:04:46.592 --> 1:04:49.345
Ricky, I can't make it.

1:04:50.054 --> 1:04:53.557
Mum, I'll be the first to go after all!

1:05:17.248 --> 1:05:20.251
They all have relatives
awaiting their release.

1:05:20.334 --> 1:05:23.295
You use them
then discard them like dirty rags!

1:05:25.047 --> 1:05:28.884
You asked for it.
There's no way you can escape.

1:05:31.220 --> 1:05:32.513
- Cyclops.
- Yes, sir.

1:05:32.596 --> 1:05:36.142
Tomorrow, summon all the prisoners
to the compound.

1:05:53.284 --> 1:05:55.202
Warden, please.

1:05:59.165 --> 1:06:03.419
Ricky Ho has caused lots <i>of</i> trouble
here. He'll be punished severely.

1:06:03.878 --> 1:06:07.214
I want everybody
to shovel some dirt into the pit.

1:06:11.844 --> 1:06:13.721
He wants us to bury Ricky alive.

1:06:13.804 --> 1:06:18.058
If we get involved, we'll be doing
their dirty work. That's not right.

1:06:19.185 --> 1:06:21.020
- Tell them to start.
- Yes, sir.

1:06:21.437 --> 1:06:26.317
Big Boy, Brain Cell, you two first.
The rest of you better follow.

1:06:41.665 --> 1:06:43.083
Go on.

1:06:49.757 --> 1:06:51.550
Ricky, what shall we do?

1:06:51.634 --> 1:06:54.053
Follow orders,
you're no match for him.

1:06:55.179 --> 1:06:56.931
But then you'll be dead!

1:06:57.932 --> 1:06:59.308
Shut up!

1:06:59.391 --> 1:07:02.603
Save your words for when
you visit his grave. Here!

1:07:06.857 --> 1:07:09.235
Ricky, I have no choice.

1:07:16.283 --> 1:07:19.078
- Ricky, I'm sorry.
- Next!

1:07:23.499 --> 1:07:25.417
Ricky, I'm sorry.

1:07:25.501 --> 1:07:27.086
Go on!

1:07:30.297 --> 1:07:33.259
Ricky, real sorry about this.

1:07:40.474 --> 1:07:42.393
Listen up, men.

1:07:45.020 --> 1:07:49.358
If Ricky Ho survives the next seven
days, I'll consider him a free man!

1:07:49.441 --> 1:07:51.318
Great!

1:07:54.697 --> 1:07:57.199
Good luck. Good luck.

1:07:57.866 --> 1:07:59.285
Good luck.

1:08:02.621 --> 1:08:06.750
This is the oxygen tube.
Let's see if you can make it, huh?

1:08:08.961 --> 1:08:12.506
Get your ass over here!
Let's get on with it.

1:08:26.228 --> 1:08:28.063
I wonder if Ricky will make it.

1:08:30.274 --> 1:08:31.734
I sure hope he does.

1:08:32.818 --> 1:08:35.863
If he dies, it's because of us.

1:08:45.831 --> 1:08:49.084
- It's Ricky!
- Ricky?

1:08:50.586 --> 1:08:52.004
He's still alive!

1:08:53.631 --> 1:08:55.132
It's him.

1:08:56.050 --> 1:09:00.137
- He really is alive.
- He can survive that, yeah!

1:09:22.618 --> 1:09:24.620
Wong Chun, that was a great shot.

1:09:30.501 --> 1:09:32.586
Looks like he'll need a plumber.

1:10:54.126 --> 1:10:58.464
Boss, this chick saw us dealing. I
brought her back for you.

1:10:58.547 --> 1:11:00.007
What do we do with her?

1:11:01.592 --> 1:11:03.010
I told you to be careful!

1:11:03.093 --> 1:11:06.013
If an old lady sees you, am I to deal
with her, too?

1:11:06.096 --> 1:11:08.182
Right, boss. Excuse us.

1:12:06.114 --> 1:12:08.116
Hold it right there!

1:12:09.159 --> 1:12:12.830
Goddammit, what the hell's your
problem?

1:13:01.003 --> 1:13:02.963
- Move!
- Move it!

1:13:03.255 --> 1:13:06.133
Do you hear me? Move it!
Move, stand aside.

1:13:06.216 --> 1:13:07.843
- Go on.
- Move!

1:13:38.165 --> 1:13:41.793
It's been raining for seven days.
The ground's wet and cold.

1:13:41.877 --> 1:13:45.422
<i>If</i> he's still alive,
he must be superman.

1:13:58.143 --> 1:13:59.895
- Ricky!
- Ricky!

1:14:00.646 --> 1:14:02.481
- Ricky!
- He's dead.

1:14:02.564 --> 1:14:04.149
Poor guy!

1:14:04.566 --> 1:14:07.736
- Ricky.
- He's moving. He's not dead.

1:14:07.819 --> 1:14:09.655
He's only sleeping.

1:14:09.738 --> 1:14:12.115
What the hell? He's still alive.

1:14:13.116 --> 1:14:14.785
Release him! Release him!

1:14:21.833 --> 1:14:24.920
- Good work! What a hero!
- It's a miracle!

1:14:51.822 --> 1:14:54.116
- Take him away. Quick!
- Yes, sir.

1:14:54.199 --> 1:14:55.575
Here!

1:15:07.671 --> 1:15:12.384
I don't think I've ever
seen anyone as tough as yourself.

1:15:12.467 --> 1:15:14.553
I think we can be friends.

1:15:15.387 --> 1:15:18.015
A wolf and a pig can never be friends.

1:15:18.098 --> 1:15:21.727
You're growing opium here.
You're all killers!

1:15:21.810 --> 1:15:23.145
I'll settle this...

1:15:24.354 --> 1:15:27.774
- Shut up!
- You lousy bastard!

1:15:31.820 --> 1:15:33.530
I see you'd rather be my enemy.

1:15:33.613 --> 1:15:36.658
Apart from the opium,
what else do you want?

1:15:38.744 --> 1:15:41.705
- Go on, hit him.
- Right.

1:15:45.834 --> 1:15:49.921
The report says you disappeared
for two years. Where did you go?

1:15:52.382 --> 1:15:56.011
As long as you're still alive,
I can make you talk.

1:15:59.139 --> 1:16:00.807
Let me do it.

1:16:24.039 --> 1:16:28.627
You lit the fire to lure me into
the open. What did you have in mind?

1:16:35.258 --> 1:16:39.721
Even <i>if</i> you want to die,
you must still answer my questions.

1:16:43.934 --> 1:16:45.435
Warden, are you all right?

1:16:46.061 --> 1:16:49.523
The day I reveal my secrets
will be the day you die!

1:16:52.692 --> 1:16:54.236
Cyclops!

1:16:54.319 --> 1:16:55.487
Sir?

1:16:55.570 --> 1:16:57.447
Bring me my pills!

1:17:18.260 --> 1:17:20.846
Ricky, Ricky.

1:17:23.223 --> 1:17:24.599
Ricky.

1:17:25.767 --> 1:17:27.853
I brought some food for you.

1:17:28.728 --> 1:17:32.691
You haven't eaten for a week.
Don't forget you're our only hope.

1:17:32.983 --> 1:17:35.735
Ricky, come on, eat.

1:17:55.714 --> 1:18:00.552
The warden's a tough guy.
Ricky, you must be careful.

1:18:02.053 --> 1:18:03.722
"Don't Give Up"

1:18:10.061 --> 1:18:11.313
See you tomorrow.

1:18:31.625 --> 1:18:33.835
What the hell's he doing here?

1:18:38.006 --> 1:18:39.424
That's Fa.

1:18:39.507 --> 1:18:42.010
Bu Chu must have grassed him up.

1:18:54.064 --> 1:18:57.067
Ricky, I got a present for you.

1:19:15.335 --> 1:19:18.129
I'll tear both <i>of</i> you
into pieces right here!

1:19:22.634 --> 1:19:24.177
Now it's your turn.

1:19:25.971 --> 1:19:27.514
Ricky, hold it!

1:19:31.059 --> 1:19:34.145
Emergency! Send in a SWAT team
immediately. Over!

1:19:34.229 --> 1:19:36.147
'They're on the way. Over.'

1:19:36.231 --> 1:19:40.068
Fa! Ricky, Fa's not going to make it!

1:19:43.113 --> 1:19:44.614
Fa!

1:19:45.573 --> 1:19:48.910
Ricky...are...you...OK?

1:19:48.994 --> 1:19:51.037
Thanks for the food.

1:19:52.998 --> 1:19:54.040
Fa!

1:19:58.378 --> 1:19:59.462
Cyclops!

1:19:59.546 --> 1:20:03.717
You're responsible for
Fa's death! Stop running!

1:20:04.426 --> 1:20:06.052
Cyclops!

1:20:08.847 --> 1:20:11.725
Bastard, you killed Fa!
You're a murderer!

1:20:23.278 --> 1:20:25.071
You're a dead man!

1:20:26.990 --> 1:20:28.199
Good work!

1:20:33.997 --> 1:20:35.498
Bastard!

1:20:35.582 --> 1:20:37.792
Don't you want to live, or what?!

1:20:38.752 --> 1:20:41.629
You hit me! Son-of-a-bitch!

1:20:44.674 --> 1:20:47.802
- Let's help him.
- Get them!

1:21:01.274 --> 1:21:03.193
Take me to see the warden.

1:21:15.246 --> 1:21:18.124
Sir, the prisoner's menu
for tomorrow is ready.

1:21:18.208 --> 1:21:19.667
Please have a look.

1:21:20.627 --> 1:21:24.589
They'll have some beans,
vegetables and meat for lunch.

1:21:26.341 --> 1:21:28.510
Don't you think that's too much?

1:21:28.593 --> 1:21:33.431
Here, we'll halve the vegetables
and the beans.

1:21:34.849 --> 1:21:36.935
We'll save the meat for dinner.

1:21:38.144 --> 1:21:41.856
Behave. Good boy.

1:21:42.982 --> 1:21:46.069
- Make sure no one starves to death.
- Yes, sir.

1:21:53.410 --> 1:21:57.705
You eat like a lousy king.
Even your dog gets a big steak.

1:21:59.499 --> 1:22:02.919
Not enough to eat?
Right, I'll give you some more then.

1:22:14.055 --> 1:22:15.640
That enough?

1:22:22.439 --> 1:22:24.441
We're not animals!

1:22:25.692 --> 1:22:29.320
So you think you're human beings?
To me you're lower than a fly.

1:22:37.495 --> 1:22:38.538
Ricky!

1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:42.500
What happened?

1:22:45.044 --> 1:22:46.421
Warden, there's a riot.

1:22:46.504 --> 1:22:50.049
Central control has been disrupted.
All the alarms are out.

1:22:51.593 --> 1:22:53.553
You assholes, I'll kill you all.

1:23:00.393 --> 1:23:02.437
Warden... No!

1:23:07.775 --> 1:23:11.112
You couldn't control the situation,
so there's the riot.

1:23:11.196 --> 1:23:12.572
You're better off dead.

1:23:12.655 --> 1:23:14.616
Warden, no!

1:23:15.074 --> 1:23:18.369
These guns are made for shooting
elephants.

1:23:26.920 --> 1:23:29.422
Ricky, it's your turn.

1:23:29.506 --> 1:23:30.715
While you still live,

1:23:30.798 --> 1:23:34.802
- they'll never go to their cells.
- Bastard, you can't kill Ricky.

1:23:34.886 --> 1:23:36.387
Who wants to die first?

1:23:47.232 --> 1:23:48.816
Are you turning against us?

1:23:59.827 --> 1:24:03.414
- Warden, I'll go get more men.
- Go on.

1:24:10.755 --> 1:24:12.757
Bastard, we'll kill you!

1:24:14.968 --> 1:24:16.678
Go on, get out of here.

1:24:32.569 --> 1:24:35.321
Come on. Push that button, it's fun.

1:24:39.617 --> 1:24:40.994
Hey...

1:24:41.869 --> 1:24:43.871
Get rid of Ricky!

1:25:11.774 --> 1:25:14.777
Wong Chun! No more fooling around.
Kill the bastard.

1:25:35.798 --> 1:25:38.843
Now you'll never
be able to kill again!

1:25:38.926 --> 1:25:40.386
No!

1:25:45.933 --> 1:25:48.728
Don't kill me, don't kill me!

1:26:02.742 --> 1:26:05.703
I almost forgot,
you're not afraid of bullets.

1:26:06.579 --> 1:26:07.997
Come here.

1:26:08.081 --> 1:26:11.876
Take my son away. If any prisoners
try to get in your way, kill them.

1:26:11.959 --> 1:26:13.336
Yes, sir.

1:26:16.923 --> 1:26:20.677
- Ricky, may the best man win.
- You think you're real tough.

1:26:21.302 --> 1:26:23.346
I'm a lot tougher than you think.

1:26:23.429 --> 1:26:27.558
The warden is usually the best
kung fu fighter in a private prison.

1:26:27.642 --> 1:26:29.477
Now see for yourself.

1:27:11.060 --> 1:27:14.981
Ricky, come and show me
what you've got.

1:27:59.108 --> 1:28:03.029
Your strength doesn't even
come close to mine.

1:28:04.781 --> 1:28:08.409
We've got the same kung fu style.
Didn't you know?

1:28:10.203 --> 1:28:13.873
, 'If your opponent is strong,
use your wits to beat him.'

1:29:31.325 --> 1:29:35.580
- Back to your cells, assholes!
- You bastards! Let's get them!

1:29:38.457 --> 1:29:40.001
Bastards!

1:29:42.837 --> 1:29:44.797
Stop fighting!

1:30:14.201 --> 1:30:17.622
You're all free now!
