WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:04.375
Justin Russo for
Student Body President.

00:04.375 --> 00:06.083
Justin Russo.

00:06.083 --> 00:09.208
And remember, Justin's
"Just-in time!"

00:09.208 --> 00:11.375
You see what I did there.
That's a compound word.

00:11.375 --> 00:12.875
Yes.

00:12.875 --> 00:16.000
I can't believe we're
running against each other.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.250
Zeke for president.
Zeke the "Beek-erman"!

00:20.625 --> 00:24.583
Ah, it's time I stood up
and became my own man.

00:24.583 --> 00:27.291
But if you give me
a good reason,
I may vote for you.

00:27.291 --> 00:28.416
Ah.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.625
It's a chicken dress.
A goose dress would
just be stupid.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.291
Vote for me for
Speaker of the Assembly.

00:39.291 --> 00:43.250
Speaker of the Assembly?
Why do you want to run for that?

00:43.250 --> 00:46.583
Because all I have to do
is introduce the assembly,

00:46.583 --> 00:49.083
and I have the rest of the time
to just do whatever I want

00:49.083 --> 00:50.750
and pull pranks
around the school.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.708
Alex, aren't you tired of
pulling all these pranks?

00:53.708 --> 00:56.000
I mean, come on, dodge balls
filled with jelly?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.583
That was a good one.

01:03.875 --> 01:06.750
Good enough to land you...

01:06.750 --> 01:10.125
...in Saturday detention.

01:13.625 --> 01:16.708

doesn't mean you're not here.

02:09.458 --> 02:12.583
OK, people of the kitchen
perimeter, let's go.

02:12.583 --> 02:16.708
Alex has detention today,
so we can go to all the places
where she's been banned.

02:16.708 --> 02:18.708
Where is she
not allowed to go?

02:18.708 --> 02:21.083
Coney Island, Ellis Island,
and Roosevelt Island.

02:21.083 --> 02:24.291
Alex thinks if you're on
an island there are no rules.

02:24.291 --> 02:26.875
But she lives on
Manhattan Island.

02:27.875 --> 02:30.291
Doesn't that explain a lot?

02:41.833 --> 02:44.500
Mr. Laritate,
in your casual weekend wear.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.708
What are you doing here?

02:46.750 --> 02:49.708
I'm here to take
Mr. Russo to detention.

02:49.708 --> 02:52.500
- All right.
- No.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.500
Justin.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.875
- Excuse me?
- What?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.958
I'm as surprised as anybody.

02:56.958 --> 03:02.250
But you know the giddy-up,
and go-go world of politics
can change people.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.833
You're coming with me.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.833
But I didn't do anything.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.250
Tell it to the judge.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.333
But you are the judge.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.000
In that case,
I don't want to hear it.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.833
Eddie, how many hours ahead?
Two or four?

03:27.500 --> 03:29.583
Oh, Mr. Laritate.

03:29.583 --> 03:31.708
I was just fixing the time,
cause...

03:31.708 --> 03:34.458
Who has the right time?
Because this is...

03:34.458 --> 03:36.583
This is all wrong.

03:37.958 --> 03:39.583
Mr. Laritate,
what did I do?

03:39.583 --> 03:41.708
You can't leave me in a
room full of these people.

03:41.708 --> 03:43.583
I hear they can smell fear.

03:43.583 --> 03:44.708
And right now...

03:44.708 --> 03:46.583
...I'm stinking of it.

03:47.958 --> 03:50.416
Nah, that smell
was in here already.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.625
What are you
doing here?

03:53.625 --> 03:56.833
Did the teachers finally get
annoyed by you turning in
your homework early?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.583
You're doing
my math homework.

04:11.583 --> 04:13.750
Oh, and you smell like fear.

04:15.083 --> 04:17.416
Mr. Laritate, you gotta
get me out of here.

04:17.416 --> 04:19.125
I'm sorry, son.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.625
But somebody has
vandalized my office.

04:21.625 --> 04:25.708
And every clue's
got your face all over it.

04:27.958 --> 04:31.208
Wagons, ho!

04:32.708 --> 04:33.708
Hey.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.000
I've seen this idiot
around school.

04:38.083 --> 04:40.000
That's me.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.291
Shut up. I'm trying to figure
out where I've seen this guy.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.583
Mr. Laritate,

04:47.583 --> 04:50.416
I never defend my brother
in anything, trust me,

04:50.416 --> 04:52.291
but this is a pranking
masterpiece.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.291
There's no way that
he could have done this.

04:54.291 --> 04:56.458
Are you saying it was you?

04:56.458 --> 04:59.291
Maybe it was you.

04:59.291 --> 05:01.458
He is your favorite student.

05:03.375 --> 05:04.875
All right everybody.

05:04.875 --> 05:05.875
Take your seats.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.208
Detention begins...

05:10.375 --> 05:11.375
Now.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.291
Hello, prisoners.

05:19.291 --> 05:20.291
Warden.

05:22.416 --> 05:24.000
Sorry I'm late.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.458
I had a phone call,

05:25.458 --> 05:27.083
with your mom.

05:27.083 --> 05:29.291
She said, "Get out of my chair."

05:36.750 --> 05:38.166
Who are you?

05:38.166 --> 05:39.708
I'm Stevie.

05:39.708 --> 05:41.083
Last name...

05:41.083 --> 05:43.833
I don't want to know yours,
so why do you want to know mine?

05:45.500 --> 05:48.000
She makes you look like him.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.625
All right.

05:51.875 --> 05:56.333
I'll be back to let you
out of the cage at 3.

05:56.333 --> 05:57.708
If you need anything,

05:57.708 --> 06:00.000
you should have thought
of that before you acted up.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.708
Hey, Stevie.

06:07.708 --> 06:09.416
Why don't you tell me
a bedtime story

06:09.416 --> 06:11.708
about how you ended up
in detention so fast?

06:11.708 --> 06:14.833
I got caught for some
stuff at my old school,

06:14.833 --> 06:16.750
so they're making me
make up detention here.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.458
But, it's cool.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.708
It's the quickest way
to meet my people.

06:23.708 --> 06:25.750
Your people?

06:25.750 --> 06:28.750
Oh, you mean, like me.
Aw! Thank you. That's so sweet.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.125
Now,

06:32.125 --> 06:33.958
if you'll excuse me...

06:35.708 --> 06:38.125
I need a couple more
hours shut eye

06:38.125 --> 06:40.125
under a gentle rain.

06:44.291 --> 06:45.875
You're gonna have
to turn that down.

06:45.875 --> 06:47.708
It makes me gotta go
numero uno.

06:49.416 --> 06:52.083
Yeah, that's right,
I speak French.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.333
Well...

06:58.333 --> 06:59.750
Wee, wee.

07:16.458 --> 07:17.458
Oh, no!

07:17.458 --> 07:20.083
It stopped. Nobody panic.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.416
No way.
I love to panic.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.625
Relax. It's OK.

07:24.625 --> 07:27.958
I'm sure it has nothing
to do with the fact that
we've overloaded this cart.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.875
Ah, they're gonna
fix it soon.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.416
Let's just, uh...

07:33.416 --> 07:35.000
take in the view,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.458
and enjoy this beautiful day
while it lasts.

07:41.458 --> 07:44.583
Well, that didn't last long.

07:44.583 --> 07:46.000
Man, it's freezing.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.250
This is why I can't wait
to get hair all over my body.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.750
Don't worry.

07:51.750 --> 07:54.250
Who wants the strawberry
patch sweater?

07:54.250 --> 07:56.625
And who wants
the butterfly scarf?

07:56.625 --> 07:59.000
Can I please use my wand
to get us out of here?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.458
- Go for it, son.
- Thank you so much.

08:05.416 --> 08:06.416
OK.

08:06.416 --> 08:08.958
- Whoa! No!
- Oh!

08:08.958 --> 08:12.083
That happened a lot quicker
than I thought it would.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.750
I'll take the butterfly scarf.

08:25.416 --> 08:26.416
Morning.

08:26.416 --> 08:28.375
Oh! Gosh.

08:31.333 --> 08:32.458
So, loser.

08:33.458 --> 08:35.166
You're the one that
pulled this prank?

08:35.166 --> 08:37.083
It wasn't me.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.416
Relax, dork.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.291
I think it's cool.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.458
Then...

08:44.458 --> 08:46.291
...yes.

08:46.291 --> 08:48.208
This was all me. Mm-hm.

08:50.083 --> 08:52.583
Are you guys gonna vote for
me for Speaker of the Assembly?

08:52.583 --> 08:54.166
Yeah, uh...

08:54.166 --> 08:55.708
We don't vote.

08:55.708 --> 08:58.166
Because you can't read.

08:58.166 --> 08:59.458
You know,

08:59.458 --> 09:04.208
there's a difference between
being bad and being stupid.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.250
Well, if I was gonna vote

09:06.250 --> 09:08.250
I'd vote for the one
that pulled all this off.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.875
My man right here.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.625
You?

09:18.500 --> 09:19.875
You didn't do this prank.

09:19.875 --> 09:23.583
I'll admit to robbing a bank
if it gets me out of here.

09:23.583 --> 09:26.000
But pranking is
my campaign promise.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.875
I can't let you take
credit for this.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.458
I'm gonna find out
who really did this,

09:29.458 --> 09:31.291
so they can help me
with my campaign.

09:31.291 --> 09:34.750
They have to have left
some clues here or something.

09:34.750 --> 09:37.291
I'm not leaving here until
I figure out who did this.

09:37.291 --> 09:39.500
All right, everybody.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.875
- Detention's over. Get out.
- Yes!

09:41.875 --> 09:43.458
Yah!

09:51.708 --> 09:53.416
Miss Russo,

09:53.416 --> 09:55.458
even though you're frozen,

09:55.458 --> 09:57.708
I can see you.

10:01.625 --> 10:03.250
What about now?

10:04.083 --> 10:05.083
Yah!

10:09.208 --> 10:10.375
Hey.

10:10.375 --> 10:14.458
Today is your lucky day.
You can hang with us.

10:14.458 --> 10:17.583
But, you're definitely gonna
have to make a few changes.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.208
Yes! I mean, yeah!

10:20.208 --> 10:22.166
Like what?

10:23.500 --> 10:26.458
For starters, we gotta lower
your pants a little bit.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.750
Why?

10:28.750 --> 10:31.625
Am I getting a shot?

10:31.625 --> 10:33.333
I'm not good with needles.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.125
No, no, no.

10:36.375 --> 10:39.000
Just wear 'em
a little lower.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.291
Oh.

10:52.708 --> 10:54.166
Why are your shoes tied?

10:54.166 --> 10:56.000
Untie them.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.416
Oh, yeah.

10:57.416 --> 10:59.083
Yeah, yeah.
Let's untie them.

10:59.083 --> 11:01.125
Right. Yeah.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.208
I like it.

11:12.208 --> 11:15.375
Everything's all loose,

11:15.375 --> 11:18.083
and jangly.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.083
It's relaxing.

11:19.083 --> 11:20.708
Wow.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.291
What up? Nada mucho.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.875
- I think you're ready.
- Yeah.

11:32.875 --> 11:35.083
To throw a rock
at that nerd right there.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.958
Giant dog on water skis.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.166
Hi-larious!

11:40.166 --> 11:42.166
Zeke's my friend.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Hey, Justin.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.500
Listen, I heard
about what happened

11:47.500 --> 11:49.000
and I know you're innocent.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.875
Whoa, what happened
to your pants, dude?

11:50.875 --> 11:51.875
Pull them up.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.000
You don't want to look
like Eddie and them.

11:58.416 --> 12:01.416
Zeke. Detention
has changed me.

12:01.416 --> 12:05.166
Eddie and them
are my crew.

12:05.166 --> 12:07.458
I guess is what
they'd say. "Crew."

12:09.958 --> 12:11.625
I don't buy it.

12:11.625 --> 12:14.375
If he's forcing you
to say this blink twice.

12:16.833 --> 12:21.250
I don't think I have a chance
of winning the election now
that I'm a street tough.

12:26.250 --> 12:30.000
I can't believe I lost you
to Eddie and them.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.166
Goodbye, old friend.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.250
OK.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.375
Now, I'm going to pretend

12:38.375 --> 12:39.625
to throw a rock at you.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.583
OK. OK.

12:41.583 --> 12:44.583
- And I want you to pretend
- All right.

12:44.583 --> 12:47.333
- that it hits you.
- OK. All right.

12:48.750 --> 12:49.875
Now scram!

12:49.875 --> 12:53.500
You nerd, dork, geek, loser!

12:53.500 --> 12:55.125
Yeah.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.291
Oh, my spine!

13:05.291 --> 13:08.125
Oh, that's so painful!

13:11.458 --> 13:14.708
Dad, is this a
survival situation?

13:14.708 --> 13:16.000
All right.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.291
I'm gonna slow
my heart rate down

13:18.291 --> 13:21.083
and then I'm gonna go into
hibernation just like a bear.

13:27.708 --> 13:29.708
Oh! I'm starving.

13:31.333 --> 13:34.250
Does anyone smell
salami and crackers?

13:34.250 --> 13:36.500
My nose is starting
to hallucinate.

13:36.500 --> 13:40.708
Oh, no. That's just my
salami and cracker earrings.

13:40.708 --> 13:42.166
We're saved.

13:46.291 --> 13:47.291
Harper.

13:47.291 --> 13:48.875
Harper.

13:49.875 --> 13:51.958
I need your help.
I've got to find out

13:51.958 --> 13:54.333
who pulled off one of the
best pranks I've ever seen.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.708
There's no better person
to help me win than
a fellow prankster.

13:56.708 --> 13:58.000
Where have you been?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.250
I was stuck on top of the
Coney Island Ferris wheel

14:00.250 --> 14:01.708
with your dad and Max.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.708
Coney Island?
We're banned from there.

14:03.708 --> 14:05.875
No. You are.

14:07.583 --> 14:11.083
Oh. So, you all
went without me?

14:13.583 --> 14:14.875
Yeah.

14:14.875 --> 14:17.500
It was kind of
an Alex-free day.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.500
Sorry. So, come on, do a little
of your bibbity-bobbity-boo

14:20.500 --> 14:23.708
and rescue your dad
and brother. Just...

14:23.708 --> 14:25.708
Bibbity-bobbity-no!

14:26.833 --> 14:29.166
I'm gonna let them enjoy
their Alex-free day.

14:29.166 --> 14:31.875
Because I'm that nice.

14:33.333 --> 14:34.416
Freeze!

14:43.708 --> 14:45.416
Finally.

14:52.583 --> 14:54.458
Wow.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.833
Either this is
a really great prank,

14:56.833 --> 15:00.458
or a new design idea
for my bedroom.

15:00.458 --> 15:02.833
Harper, focus.
We're looking for clues.

15:06.416 --> 15:09.500
Even the stapler is wrapped.

15:09.500 --> 15:13.875
By someone with nimble fingers
and lots of down time.

15:13.875 --> 15:15.208
That's me.

15:16.708 --> 15:17.875
It's not you, Harper.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.291
If only these posters
of Justin could talk.

15:24.708 --> 15:26.125
Oh my gosh. You're right.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.958
Because all of them
saw who did this.

15:27.958 --> 15:31.166
No, because I like
talking to Justin.

15:31.166 --> 15:32.708
Harper.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.875
Posters, posters on the wall.
Now it's time to tell us all.

15:39.375 --> 15:41.500
- Hello, voters.
- Vote for Justin Russo.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.583
- My favorite colors are...
- Justin's just-in time.

15:43.583 --> 15:46.375
Justin, he's the best choice!

15:46.375 --> 15:48.708
OK, OK!
Everybody hush up.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.166
Now,

15:50.166 --> 15:52.583
who did all of this to
Mr. Laritate's office?

15:52.583 --> 15:54.625
No!

15:54.625 --> 15:58.125
You, only you. Talk.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.000
I can't tell you.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.375
I promised her
I wouldn't say.

16:02.375 --> 16:04.375
Her? It's a girl.

16:04.375 --> 16:06.000
It is a girl.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.708
With nimble fingers
and lots of down time.

16:08.708 --> 16:11.250
Are you sure it's not me?

16:11.250 --> 16:13.166
Her who?

16:13.166 --> 16:16.083
I can't say, because
she's gonna vote for me

16:16.083 --> 16:19.000
and every vote counts,
as you know.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.458
And she's gonna vote
for him. It's me.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.500
It's not you, Harper.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.333
And I'm not gonna say who it is.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.625
Because this election is too
important to my senior year.

16:29.625 --> 16:32.375
I'm done talking to you guys.

16:32.375 --> 16:34.458
Posters, posters,
that didn't squeal at all.

16:34.458 --> 16:38.583
Zip it up.
Stay on this wall.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.416
I hate it when Justin
cares about stuff.

16:43.416 --> 16:45.375
It gets in my way.

16:45.375 --> 16:46.375
Come on.

16:49.458 --> 16:52.708
It's 197 for Justin.

16:52.708 --> 16:55.583
One ninety-seven for Zeke.

16:55.583 --> 16:58.333
OK. So it's a girl.

16:58.333 --> 17:03.875
That narrows it down to like
207 minus one 'cause we're
pretty sure it's not me.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.625
Harper...

17:05.625 --> 17:08.333
Forget it. It's over.
People have already voted.

17:08.333 --> 17:11.458
Now, we just have to wait
to see who the winner is,

17:11.458 --> 17:13.750
plant cheat sheets
in their locker,

17:13.750 --> 17:16.708
and you're looking at your
new Speaker of the Assembly.

17:16.708 --> 17:19.083
Where are we gonna get
cheat sheets?

17:19.083 --> 17:20.416
Come on.

17:23.875 --> 17:26.208
Eddie and them?

17:26.208 --> 17:28.250
What are you guys doing here?
You don't vote.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.458
We did this time.

17:30.458 --> 17:33.291
Them convinced me.
Them was all like,

17:33.291 --> 17:35.583
"We should vote and stuff."

17:37.291 --> 17:39.875
Justin, it looks like
you're pulling ahead.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.875
Two hundred for Zeke.

17:41.875 --> 17:44.000
Two hundred and six for Justin.

17:45.250 --> 17:46.583
I'm good with it.

17:46.583 --> 17:49.000
I did some soul searching,
and...

17:49.000 --> 17:50.333
I voted for you.

17:51.875 --> 17:53.000
And if I had voted,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.708
I would've voted
for you too, buddy.

17:57.166 --> 17:59.583
- You didn't vote?
- Mm-mm.

17:59.583 --> 18:02.083
What kind of citizen are you?

18:02.750 --> 18:03.875
And...

18:03.875 --> 18:07.416
Justin Russo wins
by a total of six votes.

18:08.625 --> 18:11.583
Mr. Laritate,
I'd like to withdraw my vote.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.375
OK.

18:15.708 --> 18:18.291
Justin wins
by five votes.

18:21.875 --> 18:24.625
This is amazing.
Your votes put me over the top.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.458
Thank you, Eddie and them.

18:26.458 --> 18:27.583
However,

18:27.583 --> 18:30.291
since Justin pranked my office,

18:30.291 --> 18:32.500
I'm afraid he's disqualified.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.500
What?

18:33.500 --> 18:35.875
Wait. No! No, no, no.

18:35.875 --> 18:37.875
Justin should be President.
He didn't do it.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.875
If he didn't do it, who did?

18:42.208 --> 18:43.833
I did. It was all me.

18:43.833 --> 18:45.458
Alex.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.625
What are you talking about?
How did you do it?

18:47.625 --> 18:48.833
It wasn't me.

18:48.833 --> 18:50.833
I know this is
important to you.

18:52.500 --> 18:55.083
- And I was on a roll here.
- You should get back up. Go.

18:57.458 --> 19:02.208
Everybody here knows that Justin
and I don't like each other.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.500
Now, that is correct.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.583
Well, then we have a confession.

19:07.583 --> 19:10.708
Justin Russo is your new
Student Body President.

19:12.875 --> 19:15.708
And Alex Russo is disqualified

19:15.708 --> 19:17.583
from running for
Speaker of the Assembly.

19:18.416 --> 19:19.416
Hold on!

19:19.416 --> 19:21.208
Hold on.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.458
Everybody stop pointing
your fingers at her

19:25.458 --> 19:27.625
and start pointing
your fingers at me.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.000
I did it.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.875
These nimble fingers wrapped
your office in Justin's posters.

19:32.875 --> 19:34.291
Even the stapler.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.208
Looks like we have
a double confession.

19:38.208 --> 19:39.208
Ooh!

19:39.208 --> 19:42.166
In the Old West,
there'd be a duel.

19:42.166 --> 19:44.125
Which is why I wait
with bated breath

19:44.125 --> 19:46.958
for the invention of the
time machine. Till then,

19:46.958 --> 19:50.083
new girl Stevie,
Alex Russo...

19:50.083 --> 19:53.166
Who can prove they're
the baddest girl at school?

19:59.625 --> 20:02.458
Does Alex Russo have
this in her locker?

20:05.708 --> 20:08.208
I knew it wasn't me.

20:11.208 --> 20:13.708
You are in a wagonload
of trouble.

20:13.708 --> 20:17.000
Eh. Bring it on,
Wild Bill Laritate.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.250
Very well.

20:20.250 --> 20:23.083
I'll see you at the next
three Saturday detentions.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.625
Hey, I'm not busy on
the fourth Saturday.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.458
Maybe we can do something?

20:30.958 --> 20:32.458
All right.
What's going on?

20:32.458 --> 20:34.250
Why'd you do it?

20:34.250 --> 20:37.083
I figured if Justin
got into detention,

20:37.083 --> 20:39.416
Eddie and them would vote
for him and he'd win.

20:40.250 --> 20:42.958
I was wrong about you, Stevie.

20:42.958 --> 20:44.750
And I was wrong about you, Alex.

20:44.750 --> 20:46.708
You knew how much
I cared about this

20:46.708 --> 20:49.083
and you were willing
to take the fall for me.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.250
Well, you're my brother.

20:53.250 --> 20:57.125
And that 20 bucks I stole from
you earlier, well, we're even.

20:58.583 --> 21:00.208
And I was wrong about you.

21:00.208 --> 21:01.875
'Cause you didn't do the prank.

21:01.875 --> 21:04.708
So, he's no longer a them, boys.

21:04.708 --> 21:05.708
He's a "get him!"

21:05.708 --> 21:06.708
Wait!

21:09.166 --> 21:10.833
Mom!

21:12.958 --> 21:15.250
All right, so what's the
real reason you did it?

21:15.250 --> 21:17.875
The second biggest
troublemaker of the school

21:17.875 --> 21:21.208
is the sister of the President.

21:21.208 --> 21:24.458
There's a lot of ways
to go with that.

21:25.708 --> 21:27.833
You're right.

21:27.833 --> 21:31.416
Another masterful plan.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.708
All we gotta do is
work on your evil laugh

21:33.708 --> 21:35.125
and we could be
good friends.

21:43.166 --> 21:45.000
Tell her her dress is pretty.

21:46.083 --> 21:47.458
Your dress is pretty.

21:47.458 --> 21:49.500
Aw, thank you.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.583
We can all be friends.

21:55.166 --> 21:58.000
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much!

21:58.000 --> 22:00.583
You are very kind people.

22:00.583 --> 22:01.875
Oh!

22:06.583 --> 22:09.416
Oh, I didn't dream this away.

22:09.416 --> 22:11.375
I'm going back in.

22:12.625 --> 22:14.833
Well, Alex is still
mad at all of us,

22:14.833 --> 22:17.166
so when she was done with me,
she zapped me back here.

22:17.166 --> 22:20.625
But, I grabbed my jerky
jacket before she noticed.

22:20.625 --> 22:22.125
Spicy?

22:22.125 --> 22:23.458
Or teriyaki?

22:23.458 --> 22:25.750
Oh, I'll have the spicy.

22:25.750 --> 22:26.875
Good choice.
