36:49.123 --> 36:50.498
Yeah, news to me.
Huh...

36:50.625 --> 36:51.833
How could you not hear it, Frank?

36:51.959 --> 36:53.084
That's all
they been talking about.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.669
This crazy motherfucker
dressed like Superman

36:54.795 --> 36:55.837
is whacking people
with a pipe wrench

36:55.963 --> 36:56.838
all over the city.

36:56.964 --> 36:59.007
Just boom!
You're down.

36:59.133 --> 37:01.176
Maybe they deserve to get whacked.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.469
Deserve it?

37:02.595 --> 37:04.638
Yeah, I heard that the people he's hitting,

37:04.764 --> 37:07.933
they're the real criminals.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.768
You just said
you never heard of him, Frank.

37:09.894 --> 37:13.605
I didn't.
I haven't.

37:13.731 --> 37:14.606
He just said it.

37:14.732 --> 37:15.732
No, he didn't.

37:15.858 --> 37:18.735
I just watched the whole thing with you.

37:18.861 --> 37:19.861
He...

37:19.987 --> 37:21.029
I thought
I heard him say that.

37:21.155 --> 37:22.030
You're like a monkey.

37:22.156 --> 37:23.740
[Laughs]

37:23.866 --> 37:25.033
I'm not like a monkey.

37:25.159 --> 37:26.868
Hey, me and Tish
going to the movies tomorrow.

37:26.994 --> 37:27.869
You wanna meet us there?

37:27.995 --> 37:29.371
No, I got stuff to do.

37:29.497 --> 37:30.872
What, Frank?
What?

37:30.998 --> 37:32.707
What do you gotta do?

37:32.833 --> 37:33.875
Nothing.

37:34.001 --> 37:36.211
Good, then you can get there early,

37:36.337 --> 37:38.046
hold a place for us in line, okay?

37:38.172 --> 37:39.547
[Sighs]

37:39.674 --> 37:42.384
Come on. Come on.

37:42.510 --> 37:43.551
Okay.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.095
I'll take you to the movies,
all right?

37:45.221 --> 37:46.429
My treat.
Shake it off, all right?

37:46.555 --> 37:47.430
Got to get out more, baby.

37:47.556 --> 37:49.266
Always kissing me.

37:49.392 --> 37:50.433
Weird.

37:50.559 --> 37:51.851
Order up.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.979
Three, please.

38:12.748 --> 38:14.457
I beg...
If I could just...

38:14.583 --> 38:16.459
Oh, come on!
- Hey...

38:16.585 --> 38:18.128
Oh, no, he didn't.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.630
Why do people have to do that?

38:20.756 --> 38:22.632
We've been waiting here forever.

38:22.758 --> 38:24.926
[Women murmuring angrily]

38:25.052 --> 38:26.761
I mean, it's important
that you realize that

38:26.887 --> 38:28.763
there's, like,
a sailor's hat involved.

38:28.889 --> 38:29.931
Hey!
- Like an actual-

38:30.057 --> 38:31.141
Sailor's hat?

38:31.267 --> 38:34.311
Hey, excuse me.

38:34.437 --> 38:35.437
Hey.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.772
Hey!
No butts.

38:37.898 --> 38:39.274
What difference does it make to you?

38:39.400 --> 38:40.275
Yeah, man.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.776
No butting in line.

38:41.902 --> 38:43.945
Go to the back of the line now.

38:44.071 --> 38:45.280
Yeah.

38:45.406 --> 38:48.116
Go fuck yourself.

38:48.242 --> 38:49.117
Fuck yourself.

38:49.243 --> 38:50.452
[Woman giggles]

38:50.578 --> 38:51.578
Yeah.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.455
Like, you know,
this big handsome guy back here,

38:53.581 --> 38:54.789
he looks like fucking shit.

38:54.915 --> 38:56.458
Literally, what's wrong
with his face?

38:56.584 --> 38:59.502
I don't know
if it's flat or wide or-

38:59.628 --> 39:01.629
Anyway...

39:06.344 --> 39:07.886
Mommy.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.263
Annie, come on.

39:12.099 --> 39:13.850
Hey!

39:13.976 --> 39:15.143
Don't butt!

39:15.269 --> 39:16.478
Who do you think you're fooling?

39:16.604 --> 39:17.479
I just saw you...

39:17.605 --> 39:18.480
crunch!

39:18.606 --> 39:19.981
Oh, my God!
- Oh, God!

39:20.107 --> 39:21.149
Oh, no!
- Wait...

39:21.275 --> 39:22.484
[grunts]

39:22.610 --> 39:23.485
Oh, God!
Get off him!

39:23.611 --> 39:24.819
What the hell
are you doing, you...

39:24.945 --> 39:26.821
You butted too!

39:26.947 --> 39:30.617
Oh, oh!
Oh, God!

39:32.536 --> 39:35.163
Oh, God, Stop him!
Someone stop him!

39:35.289 --> 39:36.456
Oh!

39:39.919 --> 39:42.796
Hey.
Have you seen this?

39:42.922 --> 39:43.880
It's weird.

39:44.006 --> 39:45.382
What?

39:45.508 --> 39:47.175
It's just what we talked about last week.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.886
I mean, you have to admit,
remember?

39:50.012 --> 39:50.887
No.

39:51.013 --> 39:53.848
A guy who...
can I just...

39:53.974 --> 39:55.558
Can I come back there?

39:55.684 --> 39:56.726
What?

39:56.852 --> 39:58.228
Can I just come back there with you?

39:58.354 --> 39:59.396
We're friends, so...

39:59.522 --> 40:00.563
No.

40:00.689 --> 40:02.357
I'll wear those plastic gloves.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.484
Kitchen door's right there,
sweetheart.

40:06.862 --> 40:09.197
Maybe she's fixing
to ask you to prom, Frank.

40:09.323 --> 40:11.199
I don't know her.

40:11.325 --> 40:12.617
I mean, come on.
Remember?

40:12.743 --> 40:14.369
No.

40:14.495 --> 40:16.037
His name is The Crimson Bolt.

40:16.163 --> 40:17.205
And he just...

40:17.331 --> 40:19.874
like, he just uses a wrench
as a weapon.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.209
I mean, somebody did it.

40:21.335 --> 40:22.919
Somebody became a real one.

40:23.045 --> 40:27.715
That sounds like a crazy man.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.384
I'm Libby, by the way.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.010
Hello.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.638
Don't go making some joke
about "Libby's on your label,"

40:33.764 --> 40:37.142
'cause it just...
it pisses me off.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.351

40:40.896 --> 40:41.771
Oh, man.

40:41.897 --> 40:44.107
I hope you'll be frank with me.

40:44.233 --> 40:45.775
I hope you'll continue to be frank

40:45.901 --> 40:47.110
in all of our future discussions.

40:47.236 --> 40:48.403
Wait.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.155
You just asked me
to not make fun of your name,

40:50.281 --> 40:51.656
and then you just
made fun of my name.

40:51.782 --> 40:52.991
I got something for you.

40:53.117 --> 40:54.159
What is it?

40:54.285 --> 40:55.827
You should come.

40:55.953 --> 40:56.995
It's gonna be rad.

40:57.121 --> 41:00.081
Lots of really awesome people.

[Whispers]
Are you him?

41:06.964 --> 41:07.839
What?

41:07.965 --> 41:09.674
Are you the guy?

41:09.800 --> 41:11.342
Are you this guy?

41:11.469 --> 41:13.303
No.

41:15.639 --> 41:16.764
It's okay if you are.

41:16.891 --> 41:17.932
No, I'm not him.

41:18.058 --> 41:21.936
No.

41:22.062 --> 41:23.605
It's cool.

41:23.731 --> 41:26.774
I hate when people butt.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.527
I got a lot of work to do.

41:29.653 --> 41:31.654
We're really busy right now.

behind your head, you freak!

Frank Darbo.

42:22.957 --> 42:24.332
Detective John Felkner.

42:24.458 --> 42:25.833
Hello.

42:25.960 --> 42:29.337
You filed a report with me a couple weeks ago.

42:29.463 --> 42:31.506
You mind if I come inside for a sec?

42:31.632 --> 42:32.840
Inside the house?

42:32.967 --> 42:37.637
Uh, it's just a bit chilly.
Yeah.

42:43.394 --> 42:46.271
Thanks.

42:46.397 --> 42:49.107
Oh, thanks.

42:49.233 --> 42:53.778
So you filed that report.

42:53.904 --> 42:56.781
Now, you and I came together
to the conclusion

42:56.907 --> 43:02.453
that your wife wasn't kidnapped,
and she left you.

43:02.580 --> 43:03.788
Uh...

43:03.914 --> 43:07.417
Is there something in there?

43:07.543 --> 43:08.418
What?

43:08.544 --> 43:10.712
Is that a basement?

43:10.838 --> 43:12.547
That's a closet.

43:12.673 --> 43:15.049
You just keep looking over there.

43:15.175 --> 43:16.634
No, I...
No, I don't.

43:16.760 --> 43:17.969
Yeah, you do.

43:18.095 --> 43:20.388
No.
There's nothing in there.

43:20.514 --> 43:22.724
All right.

43:22.850 --> 43:25.727
There's a dog in there.

43:25.853 --> 43:27.061
A dog?

43:27.187 --> 43:29.439
Yeah.

43:29.565 --> 43:30.898
You keep him in the closet?

43:31.025 --> 43:32.942
I'm afraid he'll bite someone.

43:33.068 --> 43:34.944
Oh, no, you don't have
to worry about that with me.

43:35.070 --> 43:36.195
I'm a dog person.

43:36.322 --> 43:38.489
That's who he likes to bite the most.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.075
Dog people.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.245
Okay.
- Okay?

43:44.371 --> 43:45.496
Thank you for coming.

43:45.623 --> 43:49.292
You're quite an intense fellow, there, Frank.

43:49.418 --> 43:51.002
If you wouldn't mind
signing this...

43:51.128 --> 43:54.339
It basically just cancels out the charges.

43:54.465 --> 43:56.674
I forgot to do it last time.

43:56.800 --> 43:59.177
Captain is going through
the change of life.

43:59.303 --> 44:01.012
She had a conniption fit.

44:01.138 --> 44:03.640

44:07.478 --> 44:09.187

Thank you, Frank.

44:09.313 --> 44:13.191
I'll let you get back to...

44:13.317 --> 44:15.818
whatever it was you were doing.

44:32.044 --> 44:34.087
God...

44:34.213 --> 44:37.256
Did you really call me
to be The Crimson Bolt,

44:37.383 --> 44:40.927
or was that just in my head?

44:41.053 --> 44:43.429
I don't want to go to prison

44:43.555 --> 44:46.766
and be butt-raped
and work in the library,

44:46.892 --> 44:48.267
rolling those carts around

44:48.394 --> 44:53.940
and handing out magazines
for the rest of my life.

44:54.066 --> 44:57.610
Isn't violence
against the Bible?

44:57.736 --> 45:00.780
God, please...

45:00.906 --> 45:05.493
Give me a sign that I should
continue being The Crimson Bolt.

45:05.619 --> 45:07.161
Or if I should
just throw everything away

45:07.287 --> 45:08.329
before it's too late.

45:08.455 --> 45:09.497
I'll even turn myself in,

45:09.623 --> 45:11.165
if that's what
you want me to do.

45:11.291 --> 45:14.127
But please,
don't want me to do that.

45:20.175 --> 45:22.719
Okay, did you just say
throw it all away,

45:22.845 --> 45:25.179
or was that just me thinking
throw it all away?

45:30.978 --> 45:33.521
Okay, I'm gonna
throw it all away.

45:33.647 --> 45:39.026
If you don't want me to,
please, give me a sign.

45:39.153 --> 45:43.948
Maybe you could
make something float.

45:44.074 --> 45:45.074
Okay.

45:59.006 --> 46:02.675
Easy turns with minimal effort...

46:02.801 --> 46:04.010
That's right, Holly.

46:04.136 --> 46:05.928
This is the gun that Demonswill used

46:06.054 --> 46:07.930
to spread his lust dust
over the school,

46:08.056 --> 46:10.600
the very same lust dust
that caused you and Jimmy

46:10.726 --> 46:12.435
to dress in these provocative outfits

46:12.561 --> 46:15.438
and download those pornographic
images on your computer.

46:15.564 --> 46:16.773
I'm so stupid.

46:16.899 --> 46:18.441
Sex is a sacred act

46:18.567 --> 46:21.110
that should only take place
within a loving marriage.

46:21.236 --> 46:22.612
No doubt.

46:22.738 --> 46:25.323
My virginity is something
to be proud of.

46:25.449 --> 46:26.657
I'm gonna have
these nipple rings

46:26.784 --> 46:28.409
taken out tomorrow.

46:28.535 --> 46:30.411
And to think I missed
the field hockey game

46:30.537 --> 46:33.289
all because Jim and I
were heavy-petting.

46:33.415 --> 46:35.124
Thank goodness we didn't do more.

46:35.250 --> 46:36.626
If only the two of you

46:36.752 --> 46:38.544
would have had
premarital sexual intercourse,

46:38.670 --> 46:39.879
then I would have won,

46:40.005 --> 46:42.590
and you would be
damned to hell forever.

46:42.716 --> 46:45.593
But they didn't have
intercourse, Demonswill.

46:45.719 --> 46:47.762
You see, no matter
how much peer pressure

46:47.888 --> 46:49.096
Holly and Jimmy were under

46:49.223 --> 46:50.848
to do what society
said was right,

46:50.974 --> 46:52.683
they knew in their hearts,

46:52.810 --> 46:54.018
they couldn't throw away

46:54.144 --> 46:57.146
what Jesus
had called on them to do.

58:45.772 --> 58:47.814
What's a toro?

58:47.941 --> 58:49.441
What the fuck is a robin?

58:49.567 --> 58:50.817
A robin is bird.

58:50.944 --> 58:52.319
Why is he named after a bird?

58:52.445 --> 58:54.821
Because he...

58:54.948 --> 58:57.449
he's loyal.

58:57.575 --> 59:01.453
Frank, The Creeping Bam
is just this, like,

59:01.579 --> 59:04.456
fantastic phrase,
you know?

59:04.582 --> 59:05.958
And I wasn't gonna tell you before,

59:06.084 --> 59:07.042
but it's my favorite.

59:07.168 --> 59:08.252
Oh, it's very good.

59:08.378 --> 59:10.003
You're lying.

59:10.129 --> 59:11.588
I don't need a kid sidekick.

59:11.714 --> 59:13.048
Are you kidding me?

59:13.174 --> 59:14.049
No.

59:14.175 --> 59:15.175
Look what happens to you

59:15.301 --> 59:17.344
when you don't have a kid sidekick.

59:17.470 --> 59:20.180
You get shot by people.

59:20.306 --> 59:22.849
Frank, you team up with me,

59:22.976 --> 59:24.518
and I swear to fucking God

59:24.644 --> 59:27.187
that we will take those cocksuckers down

59:27.313 --> 59:28.564
that stole your wife.

59:34.070 --> 59:35.445
Frank?

59:35.572 --> 59:37.614
Yeah?

59:37.740 --> 59:39.575
Are you ready?

59:39.701 --> 59:40.576
Yeah.

59:40.702 --> 59:42.578
May I present to you...

[Suit squeaking]

01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:07.686
That's inappropriate.

01:00:10.189 --> 01:00:12.065
How do I look?

01:00:12.191 --> 01:00:13.233
It's good.

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:17.029
All right, Frank.
Let's do this.

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:18.530
Let's go get
this Jock fucker.

01:00:18.656 --> 01:00:20.157
No.
They have guns.

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.158
We're not ready yet.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:24.494
Oh. Okay.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:25.996
Well, we can fight some other crime.

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:27.497
You know, you can show me how to do it.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.499
You can give me the one-two.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.460
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:33.003
No, my leg isn't healed yet.

01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:34.921
- Frank, don't be a pussy!

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:38.091
Come on!

01:00:38.217 --> 01:00:39.926
I should do something about this.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:41.762
You know what?
I'm gonna get some snacks.

01:00:45.266 --> 01:00:47.934
So this is what you do?

01:00:49.937 --> 01:00:52.314
Yeah.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.318
You just sit here
and wait for crime to happen?

01:00:56.444 --> 01:00:58.153
That's right.

01:00:58.279 --> 01:01:01.281

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:15.837
This is so boring.

01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:17.839
We gotta find a criminal,
you know?

01:01:17.965 --> 01:01:20.509
We gotta go out there,
and we gotta find a criminal.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:22.636
We gotta teach them a lesson
that they'll never forget.

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:24.262
Like who?

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:28.475
Well, like this guy Jerry.

01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:30.310
He keyed my friend's car.

01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:31.978
I mean, he completely just...

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:34.189
he just fucked the side of it right up.

01:01:34.315 --> 01:01:36.566
Whoa.
That's not cool.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:37.734
No, it is not.

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.236
And it is illegal.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:41.738
And he never paid the price.

01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:47.786

You're not supposed to kill him!

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:38.378

key a car again, would he?

I wasn't supposed to kill him.

You have to teach me these things.

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:05.989

was a one-time thing.

I wasn't thinking.

It was a complete mistake.

My head just ran away
with my mind,

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:29.419
and I lost control,

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:31.755
and there I was
with that rodeo statue,

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:32.922
and it wasn't my fault.

Maybe you just need to be bored sometimes.

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:48.605
Yeah, but you don't see them
getting bored in comic books.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:51.232
