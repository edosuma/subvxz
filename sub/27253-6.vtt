01:05.400 --> 01:11.000
Medici! Medici! Medici!

01:16.360 --> 01:18.320
--Cosimo! Cosimo!

01:21.800 --> 01:24.160
- Piero!
- Lucrezia!

01:24.240 --> 01:25.760
A hero's welcome!

01:25.840 --> 01:27.960
The Medici name's
never been more popular.

01:28.040 --> 01:31.480
We couldn't be in a better position
to reclaim what's ours.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.400
There is the small matter
of Rinaldo Albizzi.

01:35.480 --> 01:37.640
It seems the Signoria
are baying for blood.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.680
Then he will be hanging from a yardarm
by the week's out.

01:40.760 --> 01:43.240
In fact, his tailor
is just across the square.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.440
- We can inquire about his neck size.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.960
Medici! Medici! Medici!

02:05.280 --> 02:08.000
Your luggage is getting more attention
than you, brother.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.240
Of course it doesn't hurt
that she is Helen of Troy.

02:17.320 --> 02:18.520
What's your point?

02:18.600 --> 02:22.600
I'm just wondering how you intend
to explain the presence of Maddalena.

02:22.680 --> 02:25.640
She's likely to attract an eye or two.

02:25.720 --> 02:29.560
-Both of them belonging to Contessina.
-I don't intend to explain a thing.

02:29.640 --> 02:33.920
-So she'll be a normal slave then?
-She'll have her duties.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.040
I bet she will.

02:37.360 --> 02:42.000
-It's a little early for bells.
-It must mean Cosimo's returned.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.000
-We must speed up our preparations.
-Yes.

02:45.080 --> 02:48.920
- Aw.
- Sorry, Monna.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.240
Not this dress.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.320
Great to see you.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.720
- How's your father?
- Very well.

03:07.720 --> 03:08.720
Lovely.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.080
Cosimo.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.680
Contessina.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.360
How was your journey?

03:20.520 --> 03:23.680
Long and dusty,
with little of importance worth sharing.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.040
Of course.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.920
Donatello's sculpture
you've commissioned has arrived.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.280
Cosimo? Come and look at this.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.280
Monna.

03:43.360 --> 03:47.160
-I've missed you.
-You look so well. You really do.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.240
-Do I?
-Yes.

03:48.320 --> 03:51.000
You should have seen the crowds
in the square. There were so many.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.560
There were hundreds of them
all chanting our names.

03:53.640 --> 03:56.440
I couldn't believe it. It was amazing.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.880
-You should go and unpack.
-Yes. I miss my room so much.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.080
-It'll certainly be a talking point.
-It's beautiful.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.880
And a sign of things to come.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.000
It should be in the courtyard
for everyone to see.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.520
Now that I am back, art will once again
be the language of Florence.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.200
Here.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.000
Welcome into the Medici home.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.560
I know that look.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.920
Don't worry. I'll watch out for you.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.720
Signor Guadagni, have a seat.

04:51.200 --> 04:55.080
The Signoria were ecstatic
you heeded their call for your return.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.760
Trade is already on the up.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.280
The moment they heard the Medici
were back in Florence,

05:00.360 --> 05:03.320
shipments of wool
and silk began pouring in.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.080
What of Albizzi?

05:05.160 --> 05:07.280
He brought the republic
to the brink of ruin.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.760
Tried to overthrow democratic rule.

05:09.840 --> 05:10.840
Where is he now?

05:10.920 --> 05:13.480
In the same tower
where he once had you imprisoned.

05:14.880 --> 05:19.240
You should know the call
for his execution is unanimous.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.440
Even his friend Pazzi has changed sides.

05:25.880 --> 05:31.440
The Signoria are greatly looking forward
to your return. Ballot willing, of course.

05:32.640 --> 05:36.080
Thank you, Signor Guadagni.
Your support means a great deal.

05:36.160 --> 05:40.560
Thank you. And... welcome back.

05:43.360 --> 05:47.120
--Oh. One more thing.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.240
The mercenaries...

05:50.200 --> 05:52.600
They've ruined this city.

05:52.680 --> 05:56.200
The few that remain refuse to leave.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.600
Father.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.560
Perhaps the Medici name
could convince them to go.

06:09.640 --> 06:13.640
So, if you would allow,
I'd like to speak to them myself.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.200
And leave with a sword in your belly?
I think not.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.480
There were so many lovely materials
in Venice.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.920
You should have seen the silks.

06:32.720 --> 06:36.600
Although, cloth isn't the only
beautiful thing we returned with.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.840
-A gift for you, mama.
-Thank you.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.040
It seems you brought
many beautiful things back.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.400
With the Signoria calling
for Albizzi's head,

06:54.720 --> 06:57.040
it seems his death is inevitable.

06:58.560 --> 06:59.640
The man murdered my father.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.760
Now Florence seeks vengeance
for what he's done to her.

07:03.840 --> 07:08.480
Our paths entwine in this justice,
as they shall in rebuilding our fortunes.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.080
Speak freely, my friend.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.480
It's just...

07:20.040 --> 07:24.040
might it be possible
that another took your father's life?

07:27.000 --> 07:30.920
-You know something?
-Only that poison is a coward's mistress.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.080
Say what you will of Rinaldo.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.120
The man's no coward.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.920
It is imperative Lorenzo and I
know for certain.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.320
-Time is running short.
-Save a confession from the man's lips.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.120
I fear solid evidence
will be hard to find.

07:52.040 --> 07:55.200
Find what you can. And report back.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.640
- I said I'm not hungry.
- Eat.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.960
You should keep your strength up.

08:41.040 --> 08:43.120
I know how cold
this cell can get at night.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.680
If you've come to gloat,
take your fill and leave.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.480
I take no pleasure in seeing you here.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.840
-Why would you care?
-We were friends once.

08:54.920 --> 08:58.320
You sacrificed our friendship
many years ago, Cosimo.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.120
I have the scars to prove it.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.880
It's not like you haven't had
your revenge.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.640
Have I?

09:23.040 --> 09:25.360
What do you want, Medici?

09:25.440 --> 09:28.280
You want me to call off the mercenaries?

09:28.360 --> 09:29.640
They take no orders from me.

09:29.720 --> 09:33.160
On the contrary,
they'll be first in line for my head.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.240
I owe them wages.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.080
Leave.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.880
There can be no peace between us.

09:55.440 --> 09:56.840
Then it is settled.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.440
It appears so.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.320
How am I doing?

11:01.800 --> 11:03.080
Fine.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.640
I can't shade.

11:10.760 --> 11:13.120
Can't I draw something more interesting?

11:16.320 --> 11:20.720
If an apple doesn't delight you,
find something that does.

11:20.800 --> 11:21.920
Just not me.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.040
Emilia, leave us.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.320
--You lied to me.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.840
I'm sorry, mama.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.760
It's not that I didn't want to tell you.

12:02.440 --> 12:05.240
But you must understand
it was a difficult situation.

12:05.320 --> 12:09.840
A difficult situation?
Oh, well, my apologies.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.320
I am humiliated in my own home
and you stand by and say nothing?

12:13.400 --> 12:17.800
-It wasn't my place to tell you.
-And whose place was it?

12:17.880 --> 12:20.760
My husband's? Please...

12:31.480 --> 12:34.800
How is it that my whole family
has returned,

12:34.880 --> 12:36.560
yet I feel more alone than ever?

12:38.320 --> 12:40.760
She's just a distraction, nothing more.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.800
My husband takes no interest
in distractions.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.840
I heard that you visited our old friend.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.080
How is he enjoying his time in the tower?

13:03.160 --> 13:05.360
I'm sure the lamps burning
in the Medici palazzo

13:05.440 --> 13:07.040
have spoiled the view.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.800
Being jailed for treason
and facing execution

13:09.880 --> 13:12.400
hasn't lessened
the man's stubborn sense of pride.

13:12.480 --> 13:15.840
So put him out of your head.
The Signoria will take his soon enough.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.360
He is a reminder of the
constant battle we Medici need to fight.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.640
Lorenzo!

13:22.240 --> 13:25.560
You must find a wife of noble blood soon.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.240
I know your heart still aches for Rosa,

13:27.320 --> 13:31.760
but our enemies continue to circle us
even with Albizzi gone.

13:31.840 --> 13:35.160
Fortifying our family is a necessity
you can no longer ignore.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.040
This is a little bit sudden.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.400
Perhaps you'd like to wait
another decade or two?

13:41.640 --> 13:44.720
I have taken the liberty of scouting
a suitable bride.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.840
Her name is Ginevra Cavalcanti,
a known beauty.

13:47.920 --> 13:51.600
Her family is not a wealthy one,
but their noble lineage is impeccable.

13:51.680 --> 13:55.120
Hmm. Well, it sounds like
I have little say in the matter,

13:55.200 --> 13:57.240
just as you did in yours, Cosimo.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.440
Contessina has invited
the Cavalcanti family

13:59.520 --> 14:01.920
to the banquet tonight.
You will have your say.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.840
Has it been lost on you
how much you sound like our late father

14:09.920 --> 14:11.000
with each passing day?

14:29.040 --> 14:30.360
Bless me, Father.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.400
When was your last confession?

14:40.520 --> 14:43.960
-I'm here for advice, not for confession.
-But you have sinned.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.840
Many times.
But this is not for what I have done.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.920
Rather what I have not.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.320
I have uncovered a great sin.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.160
Yet, if I speak openly,

15:04.240 --> 15:06.120
it will set two brothers
against each other.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.400
Are you certain of this sin?

15:08.480 --> 15:10.480
I have searched for another answer

15:10.560 --> 15:13.840
and have nothing
but blistered feet to show for it.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.720
You must be cautious.

15:15.800 --> 15:21.000
To take on one man's sin
against another is no small thing.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.880
In the end,
it's God who rights every wrong.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.320
-Ormanno!
-You must come with me.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.520
Your Holiness.

15:57.360 --> 16:00.080
Arise, please.

16:05.080 --> 16:08.520
So it is true?
Duke Visconti has marched upon Rome?

16:10.600 --> 16:12.280
I had to flee the city.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.560
Thank the Lord, word came to us,
and we could save you in time.

16:16.640 --> 16:21.680
And I shall be eternally grateful
to your family.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.520
Yet now I must impose upon another.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.760
May I presume upon your hospitality?

16:30.840 --> 16:33.520
Would you accept me
as a guest in your home?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.840
-I can think of no greater honor.
-Your Holiness...

16:35.920 --> 16:40.920
Ormanno, I cannot stay in the house
of a man on trial for treason.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.280
At least not until he is acquitted.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.080
My father's reverence for you
knows no bounds, Your Holiness.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.680
He will be most upset when I tell him.

16:50.160 --> 16:54.080
Then he shall hear it from me personally.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.680
As if I don't have enough to deal with,
with tonight's dinner.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.360
I wish you would give me some warning

17:02.440 --> 17:04.080
when God's representative
on Earth comes to stay.

17:04.160 --> 17:05.760
I wish God would give me
some warning,

17:05.840 --> 17:08.200
but it seems
this was unexpected for us both.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.640
Surprises seem to be your forte
at the moment.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.640
You haven't spoken to me at all
about the year we've spent apart.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.480
Is your next grand reveal
letting your wife into the specifics,

17:16.560 --> 17:18.440
or do you intend
to hold your peace forever?

17:18.520 --> 17:21.800
- Contessina, I have been busy.
- So have I!

17:25.000 --> 17:28.960
Running this household.
Our affairs for an entire year.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.920
Oh, I took the liberty of removing
the more ostentatious artwork

17:33.000 --> 17:34.520
from His Holiness' rooms.

17:34.600 --> 17:39.080
You know his reputation for austerity.
And his condemnation of slavery.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.560
Which wouldn't have been a problem
until recently, would it?

17:41.640 --> 17:44.080
What would possess you to bring
a slave girl back from Venice?

17:44.160 --> 17:46.960
What would possess you
to send me into exile?

17:54.760 --> 17:59.480
I risked everything in saving you.
And this is how you repay me.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.880
You thought you were a martyr.

18:03.960 --> 18:06.920
But you were nothing
but a child with a paper sword.

18:08.720 --> 18:13.320
Have I not done enough now to prove
that I put this family first?

18:13.400 --> 18:15.960
Had I the choice again,
perhaps I would let you die.

18:30.840 --> 18:34.360
Excellent. I'll send for some more hens.

18:34.440 --> 18:37.160
Lay out some clean robes
for the Pope to change into.

18:37.240 --> 18:40.320
-Of course.
-Actually, Emilia, wait a moment.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.480
You there.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.320
What's your name?

18:45.400 --> 18:49.120
-It's Maddalena, Madonna.
-I have a job for you.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.200
Emilia, on second thoughts,

18:51.280 --> 18:54.120
you can go to the market
and procure the items on this list.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.960
Maddalena. Go to my husband's room.

19:02.920 --> 19:06.040
Gather some plain robes,
and then lay them out for His Holiness.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.440
I assume you already know the way.

19:16.360 --> 19:19.600
Staying with the Medici would send
the wrong message, Your Grace.

19:21.280 --> 19:25.320
He corrupts God's order with money,
raising the unworthy to power,

19:25.400 --> 19:27.680
all to the aid of his own fame and wealth.

19:27.760 --> 19:31.320
And you are accused of attempting
to overthrow the city of Florence.

19:32.440 --> 19:36.080
Tell me how that is different
to what is happening in Rome?

19:36.160 --> 19:38.640
The fate of the city hangs in the balance.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.800
As we speak, all that stands between
the Colonna family and the Curia

19:43.880 --> 19:45.040
is Bishop Vitelleschi.

19:52.160 --> 19:56.880
I thank you for Ormanno rescuing me,
and I value our friendship.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.520
But surely you can appreciate
one cannot be particular

20:02.600 --> 20:04.880
in gathering one's allies
at a time like this.

20:06.640 --> 20:11.040
Cosimo de' Medici
and Florence stand against my enemies.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.960
And so I stand with them.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.640
I do understand your position,
Your Holiness.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.080
But heed my words:

20:24.160 --> 20:29.400
Cosimo will act as a friend,
until you find his knife in your back.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.240
Thank you, Maddalena.

21:14.080 --> 21:17.320
I'd like to thank Cosimo
for this wonderful meal,

21:18.560 --> 21:21.120
and for recognizing these present families

21:21.200 --> 21:24.160
for their support of the Medici
during their time in exile.

21:29.520 --> 21:33.520
- Long, long to the life Medici!
- Thank you.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.720
I see you are getting acquainted
with the lovely Ginevra.

21:41.800 --> 21:46.760
Am I to assume she is
a good conversationalist after all?

21:46.840 --> 21:51.360
-Her bust is particularly articulate.
-Well, her father is...

21:54.000 --> 21:56.320
keen to see it in a safe pair of hands.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.240
For the Medici, brother.

22:10.520 --> 22:13.000
My daughter seems quite taken
with Lorenzo.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.960
- And Lorenzo with her.

22:15.040 --> 22:18.560
But what of this special guest
I've been hearing about?

22:18.640 --> 22:20.160
I see none worthy of such--

22:26.880 --> 22:29.520
Stand. Please.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.840
Your Holiness, my apologies.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.960
Fresh robes were meant to be
laid out for you.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.480
No apologies necessary, my dear.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.560
Robes were laid out,
and most fine they were.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.440
But I prefer simpler garb.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.840
Your Holiness.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.080
Your Holiness.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.280
I came to inquire
as to how you are settling in.

23:02.360 --> 23:03.800
Very well.

23:03.880 --> 23:07.200
And I must thank you for your hospitality.

23:08.200 --> 23:13.400
I can see that banking has been kind.
Your home is palatial.

23:13.480 --> 23:17.200
We try to steward our wealth
in a godly manner.

23:17.280 --> 23:21.640
-Forgive me, you were in prayer.
-Yes. For the life of a friend.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.800
Rinaldo Albizzi.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.640
I thought you might be praying
for your swift return to Rome.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.240
I've known Rinaldo for years.

23:31.320 --> 23:34.160
He may be hot-headed,
but he is a good man.

23:34.240 --> 23:38.040
With respect, it wasn't long ago
he was calling for my head.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.560
Now the Signoria demands his.

23:40.600 --> 23:45.040
The mandate for us to rule among ourselves
is a gift from God.

23:46.640 --> 23:51.480
Yet man has a tendency to mistake
God's justice for revenge.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.120
You believe he should be shown mercy?

23:53.200 --> 23:56.680
You must implore the Signoria
to grant him exile.

23:56.760 --> 23:59.920
It is impossible.
They will fear he will only bide his time,

24:00.000 --> 24:01.600
simply to rise up and take the city.

24:01.680 --> 24:06.240
Not if you draw up a contract
for Albizzi to sign,

24:06.320 --> 24:09.880
swearing to remain in peaceful exile.

24:12.160 --> 24:16.200
The Signoria will never trust Albizzi
to hold to such a contract.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.880
Least of all Andrea Pazzi.

24:17.960 --> 24:21.720
-He seeks Rinaldo's seat on the council?
-He's a natural politician.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.560
Pazzi was once Rinaldo's closest ally.

24:23.640 --> 24:26.760
Now he demands his execution
to send a strong message.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.760
Then a contract will do little good.

24:31.720 --> 24:37.080
-At least feign dismay.
-It is not I baying for Albizzi's blood.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.960
-Nor do you intercede on his behalf.
-You ask too much.

24:40.040 --> 24:42.800
This church has made
your family's wealth possible!

24:45.200 --> 24:48.640
I expect you to behave
in the same godly manner

24:50.280 --> 24:52.960
in which you decorate your homes.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.920
You could put your name to the contract.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.360
-Mine?
-If you were to countersign,

25:09.440 --> 25:14.120
then I believe the Signoria would trust
Albizzi to hold to the agreement.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.720
It is a noble thought.

25:16.800 --> 25:20.440
But I cannot sign such a letter
whilst blood is spilt in Rome

25:20.520 --> 25:23.520
by the same sort of tyranny
of which Rinaldo is accused.

25:28.760 --> 25:31.920
There must be another way
to save his life.

25:53.640 --> 25:55.520
Signor Cavalcanti.

26:07.320 --> 26:08.920
-Good to see you,.
-Thanks.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.720
Gentlemen!

26:13.160 --> 26:16.480
Gentlemen,
we're here today to set the date

26:16.560 --> 26:20.080
of Rinaldo Albizzi's sentencing.

26:26.640 --> 26:29.360
- If I may speak...

26:29.440 --> 26:32.440
If anyone has a right
to demand Rinaldo's death, it is me.

26:33.600 --> 26:34.800
And yet I say otherwise.

26:35.840 --> 26:39.000
Our great republic
was on the verge of tyranny.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.640
So why not make our next act one of mercy?

26:41.720 --> 26:47.320
A statement of intent?
I say we grant exile, not death.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.560
Coward!

26:59.880 --> 27:01.080
Albizzi...

27:02.920 --> 27:04.240
was a tyrant.

27:06.200 --> 27:10.040
A tyrant that brought the sword
to this city.

27:11.440 --> 27:15.120
And now Medici, Medici asks for mercy.

27:17.320 --> 27:21.200
I say we show no mercy.

27:21.280 --> 27:24.840
I say we bring the sword to his neck.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.600
Yeah!

28:13.120 --> 28:17.040
Messer Cosimo will tire of you
soon enough, you know?

28:17.120 --> 28:21.000
Give it a few weeks.
Then you'll just be a slave.

28:22.480 --> 28:27.040
Your knees will be covered in hard skin.
Your hands will lose their softness.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.040
And your beauty will fade within weeks.

28:31.400 --> 28:34.640
-Trust me.
-Just like you?

28:56.080 --> 28:57.280
Maddalena.

28:58.600 --> 28:59.720
What are you doing?

29:01.320 --> 29:05.200
-You've been sitting out there for hours.
-My art studies.

29:07.040 --> 29:10.000
No, you can't see them.
They're not finished yet.

29:10.080 --> 29:13.000
-Is it of me?
-No.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.920
Drawing the elderly
is next week's assignment.

29:28.120 --> 29:32.720
Isn't the cathedral beautiful?
Even in its unfinished state.

29:32.800 --> 29:37.200
Is art ever finished
or is it merely abandoned?

29:39.720 --> 29:42.440
I feel it is not time
to abandon this one just yet.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.640
And I'm planning to resume construction.

29:48.360 --> 29:51.760
I would be in your debt
if you were to anoint the works.

29:51.840 --> 29:55.520
With your blessing, someone like Albizzi
would not be able to stop it again.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.440
Tomorrow a man will lose his life.

29:59.200 --> 30:03.800
And yet foremost in your mind
is the completion of a building.

30:03.880 --> 30:04.920
What can I do?

30:06.120 --> 30:09.920
The Signoria spat in my face,
Rinaldo slapped my hand away.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.720
All I can do is let nature
take its course.

30:12.800 --> 30:15.200
A man determined to die
should be allowed to run headlong

30:15.280 --> 30:16.760
into his own sword.

30:16.840 --> 30:20.760
Standing aside and washing your hands
does not remove culpability.

30:20.840 --> 30:24.800
Then with respect, Your Holiness,
we have our hands in the same basin.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.520
For the speck in your eye,

30:36.280 --> 30:39.960
I miss the plank in my own. You're right.

30:43.360 --> 30:44.520
It is a risk.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.040
And there are those
that would use it against me.

30:51.480 --> 30:54.560
But I will put my name to the contract.

30:59.520 --> 31:00.600
Your Holiness.

31:01.880 --> 31:05.920
You carried this here with your own hand?
Under no threat of harm?

31:08.520 --> 31:10.560
It is a fair offer.

31:12.640 --> 31:18.920
Cosimo assures me that this could sway
the Signoria in favor of exile.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.400
An assurance
from the great Cosimo de' Medici.

31:22.600 --> 31:25.880
-Find me a quill.
-I want to help.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.360
Your Grace.

31:29.440 --> 31:32.560
The leash you think is in your hand
is around your neck.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.040
Can't you see his game?

31:35.120 --> 31:39.560
I'll wager this contract was his idea
from the start, poured into your ear.

31:39.640 --> 31:42.920
I think anger is clouding your judgment.

31:44.720 --> 31:47.720
Remember to whom you speak.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.880
Forgive me, Your Holiness.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.360
I will say no more.

32:01.560 --> 32:05.440
Save that the Medici lie.
It's in their blood.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.680
Like his father before him,

32:08.760 --> 32:13.200
Cosimo will destroy as many lives
as necessary to climb into power.

32:15.520 --> 32:18.480
I will never sign this contract.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.480
Rinaldo Albizzi has shown his true colors.

32:22.720 --> 32:28.680
His refusal to sign this generous offer
proves that he is a threat to our liberty.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.320
Yes!

32:31.400 --> 32:34.840
Exile would be nothing more
than a gift of time

32:34.920 --> 32:38.080
to raise an army
and lay siege to Florence.

32:38.160 --> 32:42.120
Death to Albizzi! Death to Albizzi!

32:42.200 --> 32:45.600
Death to Albizzi! Death to Albizzi!

32:59.880 --> 33:02.240
Death to Albizzi! Death to Albizzi!

33:08.760 --> 33:10.920
How did that contract get into your hands?

33:11.000 --> 33:13.560
-The Signoria have a right to know.
-How?

33:36.000 --> 33:39.200
Son... Ormanno.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.720
Our home will still be here when I'm gone.

33:46.520 --> 33:48.600
Keep your mother safe. Hm?

34:07.280 --> 34:08.720
All I wish...

34:11.440 --> 34:13.560
is to see you grow old, Father.

34:13.640 --> 34:16.240
To see you hold your first grandchild.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.440
To see me make you proud.

34:26.520 --> 34:28.800
That day passed long ago.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.360
Get off me!

35:00.120 --> 35:02.440
-- Unhand her! Now!

35:02.520 --> 35:04.560
- In the name of the Medici!
- Medici?

35:04.640 --> 35:08.560
--Well, why didn't you say?

35:09.560 --> 35:12.800
Your name carries no weight here.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.160
-Medici.
-And that of Albizzi does?

35:16.240 --> 35:18.360
Your paymaster is ruined and powerless.

35:18.440 --> 35:22.800
We are staying here
until we get what we deserve.

35:22.880 --> 35:26.080
Which is a hell of a lot more
than Albizzi was offering.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.440
Why don't you take that back
to your father?

35:32.960 --> 35:36.400
And we won't gut you yet.

35:43.720 --> 35:47.440
You went behind my back
and confronted them alone?

35:51.600 --> 35:52.600
Yes.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.240
Good.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.000
Now let's face them together.

36:02.520 --> 36:03.720
It seems simple to me.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.720
My paymaster is locked up in jail,
soon to be executed.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.800
And so you see,
as de facto leader of this city,

36:12.880 --> 36:15.320
you shoulder the burden of his debt to us.

36:16.680 --> 36:19.960
Plus a little extra for our trouble.

36:20.040 --> 36:24.080
Otherwise,
who can say what my men might do?

36:24.160 --> 36:28.160
Get us 1000 florins.
And we'll be gone by eve tomorrow.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.080
That's a lot of money.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.400
Leave us.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.320
And you.

36:58.840 --> 37:03.160
Swapping charcoal for a needle?
It doesn't seem a good trade.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.040
I do what's necessary.

37:06.880 --> 37:10.960
-You're very good with that.
-Have you come to make fun of me?

37:11.040 --> 37:12.360
Not at all.

37:17.240 --> 37:21.040
That's not bad.
Although I think I look better than that.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.640
Where is this going, Marco?

37:31.360 --> 37:32.880
You and me, we are the same.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.960
I just want you to know
that you are not alone.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.400
Thank you.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.120
You have a friend here.

37:45.720 --> 37:48.040
Even if the Medici tire of you.

38:14.160 --> 38:18.360
I'm paying the mercenaries
a thousand florins. To leave.

38:18.440 --> 38:21.880
I hear you are attempting
to pardon our enemy.

38:21.960 --> 38:25.000
If it's blood you're after,
you'll be pleased to know that

38:25.080 --> 38:29.600
despite my very best efforts,
it is likely Rinaldo will die.

38:30.920 --> 38:33.160
And you will let
the Signoria rule over you?

38:34.640 --> 38:36.360
Why are you shutting me out?

38:36.440 --> 38:40.320
Was it such an unforgivable treason
to have saved your life?

38:43.680 --> 38:46.680
I was alone here,
at the mercy of Albizzi's thugs.

38:46.760 --> 38:49.800
And yet I still did everything I could
to secure your return.

38:49.880 --> 38:52.800
My God, I even spied for you.

38:52.880 --> 38:55.760
While you were away delighting
in all that Venice has to offer.

38:57.280 --> 39:00.480
You're in no position to judge me, woman.

39:00.560 --> 39:03.280
Considering your flirtation
with Ezio Contarini.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.040
Yes, I flirted with him.
He even asked me to go away, but I didn't.

39:12.120 --> 39:15.160
I stayed for our family. I stayed for you!

39:16.320 --> 39:19.400
You want me to thank you?
That was your duty as my wife!

39:19.480 --> 39:22.240
What of your duty as my husband?

42:10.800 --> 42:14.600
Order! Order!

42:14.680 --> 42:18.440
Silence! I said order!

42:19.720 --> 42:21.160
The hour is here.

42:22.200 --> 42:25.080
We must weigh Rinaldo Albizzi

42:25.160 --> 42:29.840
with the scales of justice
and decide his punishment.

42:29.920 --> 42:30.920
Signor Guadagni.

42:32.360 --> 42:33.520
May I address the chamber?

42:43.960 --> 42:46.200
I have had the honor of spending
the last few days

42:46.280 --> 42:49.040
with the first true holy man
I have ever met.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.520
Pope Eugenius.

42:52.680 --> 42:56.200
Driven from Rome,
seeking protection here in Florence,

42:57.680 --> 43:02.920
knowing that we are a city
that prides itself on mercy and grace.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.080
And yet since his arrival here,

43:06.320 --> 43:09.760
I has been forced to ask myself
whether that reputation is deserved.

43:09.840 --> 43:12.000
Or whether we have lost something.

43:13.600 --> 43:15.200
Despite fleeing for his life,

43:16.720 --> 43:18.480
dressed in rags,

43:18.560 --> 43:22.120
his first concern upon arriving
in this city was not himself,

43:22.200 --> 43:23.480
but of his friend,

43:25.440 --> 43:27.000
Rinaldo Albizzi.

43:29.360 --> 43:32.440
That we show this man mercy.

43:35.840 --> 43:39.840
The very same mercy that Christ showed us.

43:39.920 --> 43:41.560
As Jesus said:

43:43.320 --> 43:47.960
"Let he who is without sin,
cast the first stone." So I ask...

43:51.200 --> 43:52.760
Who are you to cast that stone?

43:57.560 --> 43:59.720
Who are we to take this man's life?

44:57.120 --> 44:59.280
- Exile!

45:15.320 --> 45:18.160
This doesn't erase the past, Medici.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.920
You think that by saving me,
you've saved your soul?

45:25.520 --> 45:27.840
If you were wise, you will not return.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.960
Do not force my hand.

45:33.840 --> 45:34.920
Cosimo.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.360
There's something else I need to tell you.

45:47.880 --> 45:49.520
We are gathered here today

45:51.440 --> 45:56.080
to bless the continued work
on this holy place.

45:56.160 --> 46:01.200
A fragrant offering to our Lord
by his humble servant,

46:02.680 --> 46:04.240
Cosimo de' Medici.

46:05.680 --> 46:10.240
Its glory will stand through the ages.

46:11.640 --> 46:16.120
An eternal monument
to the majesty of our creator,

46:16.200 --> 46:17.440
Almighty God.

46:47.640 --> 46:51.120
Let us lift our thoughts
to the Lord above,

46:51.200 --> 46:53.960
he who breathed upon dust,

46:54.040 --> 46:58.240
giving us the precious gift of life,
trusting us to rule

46:58.320 --> 47:01.960
-his creation with fairness and mercy.
-Cosimo...

47:02.040 --> 47:04.040
There's something else I need to tell you.

47:13.920 --> 47:18.480
Ormanno! This way! Follow me!
Follow me, follow me!

47:24.080 --> 47:26.800
I hear your father died a painful death.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.040
Poison's like that...

47:32.280 --> 47:34.480
Tends to stick in the throat.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.920
-You know.
-Of course I know.

47:38.440 --> 47:40.040
And now I'm freed by your hand,

47:41.560 --> 47:43.920
it will worm its way into your mind.

47:45.400 --> 47:49.800
A maggot crawling its way
through your flesh.

47:52.000 --> 47:57.280
Maybe I killed your father.

49:31.840 --> 49:33.320
Oh, God Almighty,

49:34.720 --> 49:36.600
bless our generous benefactor,

49:38.880 --> 49:40.560
Cosimo de' Medici.

49:44.160 --> 49:50.360
A man who chose the hard and narrow path.
