WEBVTT

00:07.178 --> 00:09.130
Here you go, guys.

00:09.130 --> 00:10.931
Protein recovery bars.

00:10.931 --> 00:12.723
Ugh! Again?

00:12.723 --> 00:14.595
Yes, again.

00:14.595 --> 00:17.188
Would you like to complain
more about the free food, Bob?

00:18.939 --> 00:22.813
Mr. Davenport made them
to maximize our workouts.

00:22.813 --> 00:24.405
They have everything
the body needs.

00:24.405 --> 00:26.197
Yeah, and they
make you puke.

00:26.197 --> 00:28.819
I'm gonna hold out
until the 3:00 peanuts.

00:31.362 --> 00:33.704
Luckily for me,
I'm bionic,

00:33.704 --> 00:35.706
so I don't have
a gag reflex.

00:35.706 --> 00:38.329
We're all bionic,
and yes, you do.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.870
No, I don't.

00:43.124 --> 00:46.167
Oh! Yes, I do.

00:48.129 --> 00:49.880
What's that?

00:49.880 --> 00:52.303
Oh, this? It's just
a little CARE package

00:52.303 --> 00:54.135
my mom sent down
for all of us.

00:54.135 --> 00:57.808
Oh, wait. Nope,
it's just for me.

00:58.639 --> 01:01.522
[loud squirting sound]

01:01.522 --> 01:03.944
Oh, it's easier for me
to swallow

01:03.944 --> 01:05.986
if I pretend
it's a hamburger.

01:05.986 --> 01:07.488
Which is tough,
because I don't even know

01:07.488 --> 01:09.069
what a hamburger is.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.112
Wait, you've never
had a hamburger?

01:11.112 --> 01:13.244
That's so sad.

01:13.244 --> 01:15.456
You wanna cheer me up
by giving me a hug?

01:15.456 --> 01:17.828
That's so sad.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.750
Guys.

01:19.750 --> 01:21.832
These kids
have no social skills

01:21.832 --> 01:25.206
because they've been
completely isolated
from the real world.

01:25.206 --> 01:27.628
They have no idea
what it's like to be normal.

01:27.628 --> 01:28.969
Ah, yes.

01:28.969 --> 01:32.343
I remember your first
days out of the lab.

01:32.343 --> 01:34.805
So young, so naive.

01:34.805 --> 01:36.557
You needed
a strong hand
to guide you.

01:36.557 --> 01:39.180
Yeah. All we got
was you.

01:40.721 --> 01:43.354
These kids deserve
a taste of the real world.

01:43.354 --> 01:45.486
Well, I just got
some food from
the real world.

01:45.486 --> 01:47.608
You guys are welcome to...

01:47.608 --> 01:48.819
No, it's just for me.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.113
What was that?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.995
No idea.

02:00.201 --> 02:02.373
Mm. Better.

02:04.545 --> 02:07.708
The world's first
bionic superhumans.

02:07.708 --> 02:09.419
They're stronger
than us.

02:09.419 --> 02:10.841
Faster.

02:10.841 --> 02:12.303
Smarter.

02:12.303 --> 02:14.715
The next generation
of the human race is...

02:14.715 --> 02:16.677
living on a bionic island.

02:52.843 --> 02:55.556
Hey, Mr. Davenport.
We've been talking,

02:55.556 --> 02:58.679
and we wanna take
the students on a field trip.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.641
Great. Where you wanna
take 'em?

03:00.641 --> 03:02.683
Uh, living quarters?
The kitchen?

03:02.683 --> 03:05.686
That rock on the other
side of the island?

03:05.686 --> 03:07.808
Come on,
you know what we mean.

03:07.808 --> 03:09.570
Forget it.
They're not ready

03:09.570 --> 03:11.732
to socialize with
the general population yet.

03:11.732 --> 03:13.614
Well, yeah, but
neither is Adam,

03:13.614 --> 03:15.155
but we still let him
out of his cage.

03:15.155 --> 03:18.369
Stop talking about me
like I'm an animal.

03:18.369 --> 03:20.621
Hey, I'm hungry.
Is it almost feeding time?

03:21.872 --> 03:23.784
What is the big deal?

03:23.784 --> 03:25.376
It's not like
these kids are a secret.

03:25.376 --> 03:26.997
The whole world
knows they exist.

03:26.997 --> 03:29.670
I told the president
we would turn them into

03:29.670 --> 03:31.962
the next generation
of bionic heroes.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.385
We can't take any chances until
their training is complete.

03:34.385 --> 03:36.387
But shouldn't
their training include

03:36.387 --> 03:37.968
real-world experiences?

03:37.968 --> 03:40.391
If you hadn't let us
go to Mission Creek High,

03:40.391 --> 03:42.643
we'd still be
clueless shut-ins.

03:42.643 --> 03:44.144
Look at us now,
living isolated

03:44.144 --> 03:47.648
on a remote island;
we've come so far.

03:47.648 --> 03:50.230
Look, I built
this academy

03:50.230 --> 03:52.813
to be a protected
environment.

03:52.813 --> 03:54.154
They make mistakes here,

03:54.154 --> 03:55.616
there's no serious
consequences.

03:55.616 --> 03:57.618
What are you so worried
is gonna happen?

03:57.618 --> 03:59.740
I seem to remember
a few incidents

03:59.740 --> 04:01.121
when you three
hit the real world.

04:01.121 --> 04:02.863
You set
a dingo on fire,

04:02.863 --> 04:05.035
you got in a wrestling
match with your principal,

04:05.035 --> 04:07.998
and you showed up
in the yearbook as
the bearded lady.

04:07.998 --> 04:13.003
Exactly. And they should
be able to do those things, too.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.296
Mr. Davenport,
I know these kids.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.797
They can handle it,
they're ready.

04:16.797 --> 04:18.589
Are you sure
this is safe?

04:18.589 --> 04:21.180
- Absolutely.
- [yelling]

04:22.883 --> 04:24.725
Live and learn.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.769
I rest my case.

04:30.481 --> 04:32.443
Guys, this isn't fair.

04:32.443 --> 04:34.395
They've been working hard.
They deserve a night out.

04:34.395 --> 04:36.697
So let's sneak 'em
off the island.

04:36.697 --> 04:38.819
Adam, Mr. Davenport
said no.

04:38.819 --> 04:40.781
But think about it.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.573
When Leo took
us to school,

04:42.573 --> 04:44.204
it was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

04:44.204 --> 04:46.617
You're right, I'm in.

04:46.617 --> 04:48.709
Aw, come on, Chase.

04:48.709 --> 04:51.462
Break the rules
for once in your life.

04:51.462 --> 04:54.084
I just said I'm in.

04:54.084 --> 04:55.756
Oh.

04:55.756 --> 04:57.798
Sorry. I just assumed
you'd say no.

04:58.839 --> 05:01.301
- Why?
- No offense,

05:01.301 --> 05:03.724
- but you're kind of a--
- Fun killer.

05:03.724 --> 05:06.807
You talking about Chase?

05:06.807 --> 05:09.309
Leo, can you
cover for us
with Mr. Davenport?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.771
We wanna sneak
some of the kids

05:10.771 --> 05:11.892
out to the mainland
for the night.

05:11.892 --> 05:13.734
Perhaps.

05:13.734 --> 05:15.696
But what can I expect
in return for this arrangement?

05:15.696 --> 05:18.278
Well, I could always
tell Mr. Davenport

05:18.278 --> 05:21.321
about that time
you snuck out
in his speedboat.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.825
You kids have
a wonderful evening, okay?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.787
Okay?

05:30.791 --> 05:32.663
Where are Adam,
Bree and Chase?

05:32.663 --> 05:36.046
They're, uh...
snorkeling.

05:36.046 --> 05:38.669
Believe it or not,
there's a little coral reef

05:38.669 --> 05:41.802
you didn't destroy when
you built this monstrosity.

05:41.802 --> 05:43.804
Leo, why are you
wearing that suit?

05:43.804 --> 05:45.726
You know you're only
supposed to wear that
on missions.

05:45.726 --> 05:47.968
I can't help it.

05:47.968 --> 05:50.561
It makes me feel like
the most important person
in the world.

05:50.561 --> 05:52.182
I know how you feel.

05:52.182 --> 05:55.065
I have a three-piece suit
made out of money.

05:55.065 --> 05:57.357
Yes. We've all seen it.

05:59.149 --> 06:00.901
Look, Big D.,

06:00.901 --> 06:02.693
you may have
all the money
in the world,

06:02.693 --> 06:04.985
and the suit made
out of some of it,

06:04.985 --> 06:08.118
but you'll never know
what it's like to
wear one of these.

06:11.452 --> 06:14.795
Leo, when exactly
did the guys say
they'd be back?

06:14.795 --> 06:16.797
I don't know.

06:16.797 --> 06:18.839
3:00, 4:00,
5:00, 6:00, 7:00-ish.

06:18.839 --> 06:21.552
- Why?
- No reason.

06:21.552 --> 06:24.765
Hey, how would you
like to take my speedboat

06:24.765 --> 06:26.637
for a spin?

06:26.637 --> 06:28.769
I'd love to.

06:28.769 --> 06:31.221
Because I've never
done that before.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.617
Oh, wow,
that's slimming.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.621
Not that I needed it.

06:56.206 --> 06:57.628
This is awesome.

06:57.628 --> 07:00.170
First we go to the mall
for new clothes,

07:00.170 --> 07:03.594
and now, we get to eat
real food and play video games.

07:04.845 --> 07:07.758
Hey, Adam, who paid
for all that anyway?

07:07.758 --> 07:10.310
We were supposed
to pay for it?

07:11.512 --> 07:12.723
Be right back.

07:15.015 --> 07:18.108
Bree, this has been
the best night of my life.

07:18.108 --> 07:20.270
Wanna make it better
with a hug?

07:20.270 --> 07:23.153
Uh, no, that's not
one of the games.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.012
Wait.

07:52.012 --> 07:53.473
Gotta be healthy.

07:55.856 --> 07:57.858
Isn't this great?

07:57.858 --> 07:59.650
I don't know what
Mr. Davenport was
so worried about.

07:59.650 --> 08:01.151
The kids are having
a great time,

08:01.151 --> 08:02.863
and everybody
loves 'em.

08:02.863 --> 08:06.276
Yeah, no one can ever
accuse me of being
a fun killer again.

08:06.276 --> 08:08.068
[slurping]

08:08.068 --> 08:10.871
Okay, you've had enough
sugar for today.

08:15.165 --> 08:16.917
Ha, take that!

08:16.917 --> 08:18.378
[imitating laser fire]

08:22.793 --> 08:25.085
- Ahem!
- [shrieks]

08:25.085 --> 08:27.838
How long have you
been standing there?

08:27.838 --> 08:29.760
Long enough
to be horrified.

08:31.682 --> 08:33.724
The suit feels
good, doesn't it?

08:33.724 --> 08:35.635
Incredible.

08:35.635 --> 08:37.397
You were right.
I feel amazing.

08:37.397 --> 08:39.730
Makes me love me
even more.

08:39.730 --> 08:44.775
You realize Chase spent weeks
customizing his suit, right?

08:44.775 --> 08:46.526
He's gonna freak
when he finds out
you wore it.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.780
Oh, Chase is never
gonna find out.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.321
I don't know.

08:51.321 --> 08:53.323
I do like to talk.

08:53.323 --> 08:56.827
And I do like to
disable bionics.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.789
Don't just stand there.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.581
Work it, Don.
Show me what you got.

09:02.663 --> 09:04.715
You're probably right.

09:04.715 --> 09:06.627
I should change out of it
before they come back.

09:09.630 --> 09:11.632
[alarm sounding]

09:13.013 --> 09:15.636
Oh, no. It's stuck.

09:15.636 --> 09:18.639
I'm obviously
too muscular for the suit.

09:18.639 --> 09:21.061
Yes, that must be
the problem.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.774
Just help me
get it off. Here, pull.

09:23.774 --> 09:25.856
Just... yeah.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.649
[both muttering]

09:30.400 --> 09:33.153
This is a fun
father-son activity.

09:35.495 --> 09:37.868
You broke the zipper.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.160
Now you're gonna have to
pull it with your teeth.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.873
You know what,
just disable my bionics.

09:50.510 --> 09:52.012
Can you stop that?

09:52.012 --> 09:54.174
Oh, I can, but, uh,

09:54.174 --> 09:56.306
Lester the Unicorn can't.

09:58.679 --> 10:00.180
Right, Bob?

10:01.982 --> 10:03.724
Bob?

10:03.724 --> 10:05.275
Hey, Spin,
have you seen Bob?

10:06.647 --> 10:09.690
Don't worry.

10:09.690 --> 10:12.612
Bob, have you
seen Spin?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.284
They're not here.

10:14.284 --> 10:15.786
I thought you did
a head count.

10:15.786 --> 10:18.789
- I did.
There were 18.
- We brought 20.

10:18.789 --> 10:22.663
Hey, you told me to count.
You didn't tell me to how many.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.204
Well, where are they?

10:32.803 --> 10:34.634
Man, that game was fun.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.637
I like the big light
that flashes in your eyes.

10:39.469 --> 10:41.261
Oh, no.

10:41.261 --> 10:43.433
Everybody's gone.

10:43.433 --> 10:44.895
We don't know
how to get home.

10:44.895 --> 10:47.437
Relax. Adam would
never leave us.

10:47.437 --> 10:49.029
Right, Adam?

10:50.731 --> 10:53.233
Chase, have you
seen Adam?

10:53.233 --> 10:56.737
- Adam, have you--
- They're not here, Bob!

11:04.244 --> 11:06.707
How could you forget
Spin and Bob?

11:06.707 --> 11:09.129
How could you forget
Bob and Spin?

11:09.129 --> 11:10.711
Guys, stop.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.552
It doesn't matter that
you both messed up,

11:12.552 --> 11:14.965
and I am
completely innocent.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.967
We need to find them
before Mr. Davenport figures out

11:16.967 --> 11:18.348
that they're gone.

11:18.348 --> 11:19.970
She's right.

11:19.970 --> 11:23.143
We better tell Leo
to keep covering for us.

11:23.143 --> 11:26.396
And how are you innocent?

11:26.396 --> 11:28.769
[crying]

11:28.769 --> 11:31.441
Mr. Davenport,
I'm so sorry.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.653
I tried to stop them.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.617
[sighs]
Girl tears.

11:37.617 --> 11:39.950
More powerful than
any bionic ability.

11:39.950 --> 11:42.162
That's not fair.

11:42.162 --> 11:44.664
I thought only Chase
had that ability.

11:52.793 --> 11:55.886
Whatever you call that dance,
I am not doing it.

11:55.886 --> 11:57.798
I'm not doing a dance.

11:57.798 --> 11:59.469
I poured olive oil
down the suit,

11:59.469 --> 12:01.261
and I'm trying to slide
my way out of it.

12:03.513 --> 12:05.685
Could you watch the floor?
You're leaking.

12:05.685 --> 12:08.148
You got any better ideas?

12:10.480 --> 12:12.442
[screaming]

12:15.115 --> 12:17.818
How is this gonna help me
get out of the suit?

12:17.818 --> 12:19.780
Oh, it's not. I just
really enjoy doing it.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.781
What?!

12:20.781 --> 12:22.622
Leo?

12:22.622 --> 12:24.324
Leo?

12:24.324 --> 12:25.786
That's Chase.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.417
[thud]

12:28.829 --> 12:30.460
He can't see me
in this thing.

12:30.460 --> 12:32.793
- Good point.
- [shrieks]

12:34.634 --> 12:36.797
Hey, what's up?

12:36.797 --> 12:38.678
We left Spin and Bob
on the mainland.

12:38.678 --> 12:39.930
Can you keep
covering for us?

12:39.930 --> 12:42.592
Yeah, no problem.
Get out!

12:42.592 --> 12:44.805
[sniffing]

12:44.805 --> 12:47.848
Are you wearing
olive oil?

12:47.848 --> 12:50.560
What a man does
with his imported oils

12:50.560 --> 12:52.352
is his own business.

12:52.352 --> 12:53.814
[sniffs]

12:53.814 --> 12:56.396
Whatever you're doing,
man, it's working.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.404
Bob, what are you doing?

13:04.404 --> 13:08.288
I'm loading up.
They ran out of
the little cups.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.121
Knock it off and help me
figure out how to get home.

13:11.121 --> 13:12.913
Why don't you just
call Chase?

13:12.913 --> 13:14.504
Because my phone's dead.

13:14.504 --> 13:16.466
Well, let's just
walk back.

13:16.466 --> 13:18.758
We live in the middle
of the ocean, Bob.

13:18.758 --> 13:20.680
Oh, you've got
an answer for everything.

13:22.132 --> 13:24.134
- [crashing sound]
- What was that?

13:24.134 --> 13:26.306
Sh! Someone's
breaking in.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.888
Quick, hide!

13:30.770 --> 13:32.772
[siren blaring]

13:34.694 --> 13:36.857
We were this close
to getting away with

13:36.857 --> 13:38.778
a bank vault of cash,

13:38.778 --> 13:41.821
and now, we're stuck
in here, surrounded by cops.

13:44.614 --> 13:46.706
Go check the back doors.

13:51.791 --> 13:53.663
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

13:53.663 --> 13:56.917
Yeah. Let's see if they have
a charger for the phone.

14:04.424 --> 14:07.597
The GPS locators
on their chips
say they're 20 feet away.

14:07.597 --> 14:08.969
They're still inside
the burger joint.

14:08.969 --> 14:11.231
But look at all those
police cars.

14:11.231 --> 14:13.603
What did Bob do now?

14:13.603 --> 14:16.186
Why do you always
assume it's Bob?

14:16.186 --> 14:18.688
Uh, because he is
a mini version of you.

14:18.688 --> 14:21.982
You're just jealous
because nobody wants
to be like you.

14:23.783 --> 14:25.485
That's the police radio.

14:25.485 --> 14:27.617
I'll use my bionic hearing
to listen in.

14:30.790 --> 14:32.832
[dispatcher]
 Attention, all units.

14:32.832 --> 14:35.295
Bank robbers are barricaded
in the Game and Grub Arcade.

14:35.295 --> 14:37.797
Oh, no. Spin and Bob
must be stuck in there

14:37.797 --> 14:40.500
with the four
ex-convicts that
just robbed the bank.

14:40.500 --> 14:43.343
Man! I hope they didn't
rob Federal Financial.

14:43.343 --> 14:45.715
That's where I keep
my retirement fund.

14:49.349 --> 14:51.891
[both straining]

14:51.891 --> 14:53.353
Suck in your gut.

14:53.353 --> 14:55.105
I'm sucking,
I'm sucking.

14:55.105 --> 14:57.978
Suck harder!

14:59.940 --> 15:01.691
It's not working.

15:01.691 --> 15:03.823
I know.

15:03.823 --> 15:05.785
I'll get your new
laser cutters.

15:05.785 --> 15:08.288
That'll rip you open.

15:09.289 --> 15:11.291
[ringtone plays]

15:11.291 --> 15:12.662
Leo, your phone.

15:14.624 --> 15:16.586
Hello.

15:16.586 --> 15:18.588
Hey, it's Adam.
Adam Davenport.

15:18.588 --> 15:20.880
Adam, you don't have
to say your last name.

15:20.880 --> 15:25.465
Uh, you do if you believe
in proper phone etiquette.

15:25.465 --> 15:28.098
Listen, Leo, you gotta
cover for us a little longer.

15:28.098 --> 15:30.390
Spin and Bob are trapped
with a gang of bank robbers.

15:30.390 --> 15:32.052
What?!

15:32.052 --> 15:34.724
You do realize this is
Mr. Davenport, right?

15:34.724 --> 15:37.517
Uh, I do now.
Bye.

15:40.150 --> 15:41.561
All right, Big D.

15:41.561 --> 15:44.774
Assume the position.

15:44.774 --> 15:48.028
You have been covering for
Adam, Bree and Chase.

15:48.028 --> 15:50.870
And you have been letting
a kid play with

15:50.870 --> 15:52.662
very dangerous tools.

15:52.662 --> 15:54.244
Are we good here?

15:57.707 --> 15:59.959
We gotta get outta here.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.382
Okay, here's the plan.

16:02.382 --> 16:04.964
You distract them by
tossing this near them.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.757
- Then I'll spin us
outta here.
- Great idea.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.681
[toy squeaks]

16:12.972 --> 16:16.516
Wait. Did you say near them
or at them?

16:18.148 --> 16:21.361
Looks like we just found
our ticket outta here, fellas.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.655
Sorry, kids, but you're
not goin' anywhere.

16:25.655 --> 16:29.159
Oh. Well, in that case,
I'll go fire up the grill.

16:32.372 --> 16:34.164
What's going on?

16:34.164 --> 16:36.456
The police are trying
to negotiate with
the bank robbers.

16:36.456 --> 16:38.668
They have Spin and Bob,
and they're using them
as leverage to escape.

16:38.668 --> 16:42.082
Oh, good. At least they're
being supervised by adults.

16:44.964 --> 16:46.676
Don't worry. I'm sure
Adam, Bree and Chase

16:46.676 --> 16:48.888
will be here any minute
to rescue us.

16:48.888 --> 16:50.630
No. You know what?

16:50.630 --> 16:53.263
It's up to us.
We have to save the day.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.305
We're bionic heroes.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.397
Uh-uh-uh. In training.

16:58.978 --> 17:00.770
Okay, freeze.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.352
You have exactly
five seconds

17:02.352 --> 17:04.444
to hand yourselves over
to the police,

17:04.444 --> 17:06.695
or face the wrath
of two bionic heroes.

17:06.695 --> 17:08.948
In training.

17:08.948 --> 17:10.950
Would you stop that?

17:10.950 --> 17:14.574
Enough. I told you two
to stay outta the way.

17:14.574 --> 17:16.955
Now go play your little
superhero game over there.

17:16.955 --> 17:18.788
Ready, Bob?

17:18.788 --> 17:21.751
Ready.

17:21.751 --> 17:23.213
You said you were ready.

17:23.213 --> 17:25.585
Oh, I'm ready.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.718
Then do something.

17:28.718 --> 17:30.009
If you want me
to do something,

17:30.009 --> 17:31.761
then say do something,

17:31.761 --> 17:34.174
and stop asking me
if I'm ready.

17:51.691 --> 17:53.193
Spin, watch out!

17:58.828 --> 18:01.621
Game over.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.003
Guys!

18:05.835 --> 18:07.547
Don't worry.
We're here to save you.

18:07.547 --> 18:09.799
Too late.
We already took care of it.

18:09.799 --> 18:12.051
Criminals have
been apprehended

18:12.051 --> 18:14.053
by two bionic heroes.

18:14.053 --> 18:15.765
In training.

18:17.717 --> 18:20.019
You're killin' me, man.

18:23.223 --> 18:25.815
Guys, what were
you thinking?

18:25.815 --> 18:28.688
You can't just stay
behind because you're
having a good time.

18:28.688 --> 18:30.900
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back up.

18:30.900 --> 18:32.692
We didn't stay here.

18:32.692 --> 18:34.444
You left us behind.

18:34.444 --> 18:36.786
That is not true...

18:36.786 --> 18:39.789
We'll talk about this later.

18:39.789 --> 18:42.702
Right now, we need
to get back home

18:42.702 --> 18:44.624
before Mr. Davenport
realizes we're gone.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.626
Too late.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.748
Hey, everybody.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.130
I specifically told you

18:51.130 --> 18:53.213
not to take the students
off the island,

18:53.213 --> 18:54.674
and what did you do?

18:54.674 --> 18:56.556
Um...

18:56.556 --> 18:58.718
He doesn't even know.
We're in the clear.

19:00.560 --> 19:03.062
They were stuck here
with no idea how to get home.

19:03.062 --> 19:05.895
Not to mention, someone
could've gotten seriously hurt.

19:07.106 --> 19:09.359
So maybe tonight
didn't go great,

19:09.359 --> 19:11.361
but we had the best time.

19:11.361 --> 19:13.653
We played cool games,
hung out like real kids,

19:13.653 --> 19:15.735
and we learned a ton.

19:15.735 --> 19:19.619
Yeah, I learned that chipotle
mayo is my favorite flavor,

19:19.619 --> 19:22.832
and hand sanitizer
is not a flavor.

19:24.284 --> 19:27.747
Plus we finally got to
put our bionics to use,

19:27.747 --> 19:30.880
and not just for some
lame academy training exercise.

19:33.132 --> 19:35.795
Which I love as much
as your protein bars.

19:37.557 --> 19:39.559
Okay. I get it.

19:39.559 --> 19:42.432
Just next time,
don't sneak out to do it.

19:42.432 --> 19:44.684
All right? Now go
fill the police in

19:44.684 --> 19:47.567
on what happened,
and we'll be out in a second.

19:49.399 --> 19:53.152
Well, all's well
that ends well, so...

19:53.152 --> 19:54.814
Oh, no.

19:54.814 --> 19:56.986
You are still in trouble.

20:00.490 --> 20:03.373
I'm sorry.
I tried to stop them.

20:03.373 --> 20:06.586
[crying]
I did, too.

20:08.668 --> 20:12.632
Okay, okay,
not working.

20:12.632 --> 20:15.965
Hey, why are you wearing
your snowsuit?

20:15.965 --> 20:18.428
Uh...

20:18.428 --> 20:19.799
it... well...

20:19.799 --> 20:22.762
It, um...
It's funny.

20:22.762 --> 20:25.685
I don't have to justify
myself to you.

20:26.686 --> 20:28.187
Wait a second.

20:28.187 --> 20:29.899
Is that...

20:36.115 --> 20:38.408
My mission suit?!

20:39.989 --> 20:42.702
[imitates laser fire]

20:43.663 --> 20:45.995
Force field.
Super speed.

20:54.964 --> 20:57.677
Okay, guys,
I'm off to the mainland.

20:57.677 --> 21:00.680
Wait. So everything's
okay with my suit?

21:00.680 --> 21:03.513
Yep. See ya soon.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.765
And you cleaned it?

21:05.765 --> 21:08.227
Good as new.
Toodles.

21:08.227 --> 21:10.730
[alarm sounds]

21:10.730 --> 21:13.733
- We got a mission alert.
- Let's go.

21:13.733 --> 21:16.696
Oh, boy.
Good luck with that.

21:26.706 --> 21:28.998
[screams]

21:28.998 --> 21:30.830
Something's different.

21:30.830 --> 21:32.712
Did you get a haircut?
