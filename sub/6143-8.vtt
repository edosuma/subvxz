00:03.633 --> 00:06.100
-Hello, this is Josh.
I am unavailable.

00:06.133 --> 00:07.700
I am too busy.
I am too busy for you.

00:07.733 --> 00:08.733
(beeps)

00:08.767 --> 00:10.333
-Yeah, hi, Josh.

00:10.367 --> 00:11.767
Um...

00:11.800 --> 00:14.633
I am aware that I agreed we
wouldn't see each other again,

00:14.667 --> 00:16.767
so this is
slightly embarrassing.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.233
Um...

00:18.267 --> 00:22.233
What seems to be happening
now though is I've had
this little thought

00:22.267 --> 00:29.500
that what might be
just wonderful is if I could
in fact actually see you again.

00:29.533 --> 00:34.167
Knowing full well that you
have a boyfriend, so this is
a selfish call.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.833
I guess I've weighed up how
selfish I'm comfortable being

00:36.867 --> 00:39.767
versus how much I do in fact
want to talk to you.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.267
And I think what we're seeing
now is I want to talk to you
quite a bit.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.233
Full disclosure.

00:45.267 --> 00:50.667
I've had a pretty
full-on headache all week
and it's not looking optimistic.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.133
I'm in hospital.

00:52.167 --> 00:56.100
It's a glass half-empty
and the glass half-full part
is my mum's tears.

00:56.133 --> 00:58.333
I realize that makes me
a far less attractive prospect

00:58.367 --> 01:01.633
than your boyfriend
and would advise
against seeing me.

01:03.567 --> 01:04.767
-I have chlamydia.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.667
-Again?
-Again.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.800
-Okay. So we're
doing this today.

01:09.833 --> 01:11.400
-Yes.

01:11.433 --> 01:12.767
-Have you been to the doctor?

01:12.800 --> 01:14.633
-No.
-How do you know?

01:14.667 --> 01:16.267
-I just know, okay?

01:16.300 --> 01:18.533
-Okay. Have you told Ella?

01:18.567 --> 01:20.433
-No.
-How will you tell Ella?

01:20.467 --> 01:22.200
-Okay, so here's the thing--

01:22.233 --> 01:24.233
-Here we go!
-Here we go.

01:24.267 --> 01:26.100
-(laughing) Here we go!

01:26.133 --> 01:28.133
-So, before we had sex,

01:28.167 --> 01:30.233
Ella did a very
responsible thing

01:30.267 --> 01:33.267
where she asked me when
the last time I'd had
a sexual health test was.

01:33.300 --> 01:36.400
As you know, I've never
had a sexual health test,

01:36.433 --> 01:38.600
so I said, "Last week."

01:38.633 --> 01:41.567
-Here we go!

01:41.600 --> 01:43.633
-(sighs) So here's what
we're gonna do.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.267
-We?
-Yes, we're a team.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.767
-Like Siegfried and Roy.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.833
-No, not that type of team.

01:47.867 --> 01:49.433
-Like Milo and Otis.

01:49.467 --> 01:51.567
-You only have to take
one pill, right?

01:51.600 --> 01:52.600
-Right.

01:52.633 --> 01:54.267
-So I go to the doctor,

01:54.300 --> 01:55.733
I get the medicine,

01:55.767 --> 01:57.133
but I do not take it.

01:57.167 --> 01:59.133
-Like Simon and Garfunkel!

01:59.167 --> 02:00.700
-I go to another doctor,

02:00.733 --> 02:02.433
I get the second dose,

02:02.467 --> 02:05.067
I take one, and then
we sneak the other one

02:05.100 --> 02:06.800
into Ella's food
and disinfect her.

02:06.833 --> 02:08.733
-Tom, that is crazy.

02:08.767 --> 02:10.367
-(chuckles) Okay.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.267
I admit as it came out of
my mouth it did sound crazier
than it did in my head.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.433
-All right. I'm in.

02:16.467 --> 02:17.500
-Thank you.

02:17.533 --> 02:20.100
* One, two,
one, two, three, four *

02:20.133 --> 02:22.067
* Ooh, ooh, ooh,

02:22.100 --> 02:24.400
-* Yeah, I'll be fine, yeah
-* Ooh, ooh, ooh,

02:25.533 --> 02:27.367
* Ooh, ooh, ooh,

02:27.400 --> 02:29.133
-* Okay, yeah
-* Ooh, ooh, ooh,

02:29.167 --> 02:31.600
-* Oh, the good Lord knows it
-* Ooh, ooh, ooh,

02:31.633 --> 02:33.833
-* Oh, the good Lord knows it
-* Ooh, ooh, ooh,

02:33.867 --> 02:37.500
* I left better behind
to be fine *

02:37.533 --> 02:39.167
* Yeah, yeah

02:39.200 --> 02:41.800
* Make my momma turn another
blind eye *

02:41.833 --> 02:44.333
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

02:44.367 --> 02:47.067
* I left better behind
to be fine *

02:48.800 --> 02:51.067
-Ben: Ben...
-Voicemail: ...is not available.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.800
At the tone, please leave
your message.

02:52.833 --> 02:53.833
-(beep)

02:53.867 --> 02:55.767
-Ben, hi. This is Josh.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.800
Yeah, I'm a little bit offended

02:57.833 --> 03:00.567
that you're so surprised
that you want to see me again.

03:00.600 --> 03:05.333
Uh, and a little bit not sure
what you're asking me,

03:05.367 --> 03:07.633
'cause you're saying
you want to see me again,

03:07.667 --> 03:09.800
but then you're saying
that you're in a hospital.

03:09.833 --> 03:13.733
-Are you asking me
to see you again in hospital?
-(call waiting beeps)

03:13.767 --> 03:15.400
Mae!

03:15.433 --> 03:17.167
-You never call me.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.567
-Yeah, well, also
you never call me.
So whatever.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.667
-I need you to babysit
Grace tonight.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.567
-Yes! Grace wants to come visit!

03:24.600 --> 03:26.700
-No, I'm making dinner
for your dad.

03:26.733 --> 03:29.400
I'm going to try
and convince him to forgive me.

03:29.433 --> 03:31.067
-Yeah, I don't want
your life story, Mae.

03:31.100 --> 03:35.633
Just bring little Grace
and whatever hilarious, tiny
outfits you have after 5:00 p.m.

03:35.667 --> 03:38.267
-Okay. Thank you.

03:40.767 --> 03:43.167
-You need to drink more water.
I'm always telling you that.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.633
-I have nowhere to put it.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.533
Why would they put it
in a clear bag?

03:46.567 --> 03:48.233
-Are you ready
for a blood test?

03:48.267 --> 03:50.000
-Yes. Again?
-Yes.

03:51.133 --> 03:53.100
-The last doctor
penetrated my penis.

03:53.133 --> 03:56.333
He went inside my penis.

03:56.367 --> 03:58.300
And then this doctor didn't
penetrate my penis,

03:58.333 --> 04:00.667
so I know that wasn't
entirely necessary and
I'm a little bit confused...

04:00.700 --> 04:02.800
-(shushes)
-...about what
I've been through.

04:04.267 --> 04:06.267
I'm going to sneak Ella's pill
into her tagine.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.233
I've thought about it
and I've decided it's fine.

04:08.267 --> 04:09.767
-We're having tagine?

04:09.800 --> 04:11.100
-Yeah.

04:11.133 --> 04:12.300
-Hm.

04:12.333 --> 04:15.433
-Well, can I at least pick
the prettiest piece of parsley?

04:15.467 --> 04:16.600
-Um, okay.

04:16.633 --> 04:18.000
-Do you know what I'm done with?

04:18.033 --> 04:21.400
I'm done with feeling insecure
when cool kids make me
an espresso.

04:21.433 --> 04:23.433
Screw them. They don't get to
make me feel insecure

04:23.467 --> 04:25.133
just because they've got
asymmetrical hair!

04:25.167 --> 04:27.000
-Ladies, ladies!

04:28.133 --> 04:29.467
-Hello, Mae!
-Josh!

04:29.500 --> 04:30.833
I've been thinking
about it and I'm sorry.

04:30.867 --> 04:32.333
You're right.
I should have called. Okay?

04:32.367 --> 04:34.467
-Oh, it's okay. I'm in a hurry.
I have to go.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.833
-No, no. First, tell me
how you are.

04:35.867 --> 04:37.633
-Oh, I'm such a mess.
Just so bad.

04:37.667 --> 04:39.400
Josh, your Dad is really
punishing me.

04:39.433 --> 04:41.233
-Yes. Let's have a dance.
-(upbeat dance music plays)

04:41.267 --> 04:44.067
-What? Oh. No.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.533
-Ah, okay. (laughs)
-(Josh vocalizes)

04:46.567 --> 04:49.500
Okay. What do you think,
Gracie, huh?

04:49.533 --> 04:51.233
Oh, okay.

04:51.267 --> 04:53.333
Ah! (laughing)

04:54.667 --> 04:56.033
Okay.

04:56.067 --> 04:58.067
-Okay, you can go.
'Kay, come on. Go, go, go.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.500
Give me the baby.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.333
-Okay. Okay, Gracie.
-Okay.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.333
Bye-bye. Bye, Gracie.

05:03.367 --> 05:07.100
-Oh, Gracie, actually,
you love me. Actually,
you love me, okay?

05:07.133 --> 05:08.300
-How's it going?

05:08.333 --> 05:09.500
-Not well, is it?
She's settled in.

05:09.533 --> 05:11.433
She won't leave the kitchen.
She's so fuckin' delightful.

05:11.467 --> 05:12.800
-Well, what do we do?
I don't want to have

05:12.833 --> 05:14.267
to talk about it
like mature adults.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.433
-Okay, I'll think of something.
-Ella: Josh! The water's
boiling over.

05:16.467 --> 05:17.633
-Well, take it
off the heat.
-Hi!

05:17.667 --> 05:19.300
You told me not to interfere.

05:25.067 --> 05:26.067
-Mm.

05:27.233 --> 05:30.400
So, today I met this lady

05:30.433 --> 05:34.067
who reckons that she kept
a goldfish alive for 16 years.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.767
-Well, that just
can't be possible.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.600
-Either it's bullshit,
or she's a witch.

05:37.633 --> 05:39.433
-Oh, no. She was a witch.

05:39.467 --> 05:41.100
I met a witch
and I fucked up.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.433
-How did you fuck up? What were
you supposed to do with a witch?

05:43.467 --> 05:45.067
-Magic.

05:48.433 --> 05:51.600
-So, guys, I have something
to tell you that I've just been
a bit too awkward

05:51.633 --> 05:53.133
to tell you about.

05:53.167 --> 05:54.267
-What?

05:54.300 --> 05:55.500
-Um...

05:55.533 --> 05:57.367
So it's not a big deal, okay?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.433
It's disgusting, but
it's not a big deal.

05:59.467 --> 06:01.300
-Yeah, what is it?
-I have worms.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.700
-Worms?

06:02.733 --> 06:04.167
-Worms?

06:04.200 --> 06:05.333
-Yes.

06:05.367 --> 06:06.700
-Why are you telling us this?

06:06.733 --> 06:08.600
You don't have to
tell us everything.

06:08.633 --> 06:12.067
-Because if I have worms,

06:12.100 --> 06:14.800
then maybe they're in the house,
their eggs are in the house,

06:14.833 --> 06:17.067
and we all have to
take medication.

06:17.100 --> 06:20.633
-How the fuck did
you get worms?

06:20.667 --> 06:23.333
-Yeah, I don't know.
Okay, I don't know
how I got them.

06:23.367 --> 06:25.633
-How do you know?
Like, what does it
feel like to have worms?

06:25.667 --> 06:27.167
-(Claire laughs)
-I just...

06:27.200 --> 06:28.467
I just know.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.300
-You are fucking disgusting.

06:30.333 --> 06:31.800
You are fucking disgusting.

06:31.833 --> 06:34.233
-No, it's normal.
Things like this happen.

06:34.267 --> 06:35.833
There's no shame.

06:35.867 --> 06:37.433
-Yeah, really normal.

06:37.467 --> 06:39.700
-Tom, why are you
okay with this?

06:39.733 --> 06:43.133
Why don't you have the decency
to at least act as though
you're grossed out?

06:43.167 --> 06:45.033
Arnold's being really quiet.

06:45.067 --> 06:46.600
-No. No, it's fine. I'm fine.

06:46.633 --> 06:49.200
What do we have to do?
Just tell me what I have to do
to get rid of the worms.

06:49.233 --> 06:53.300
-Yes, we just all have to
get treated 'cause otherwise
they'll keep on living.

06:53.333 --> 06:55.533
-Oh, my...
-They live in the sheets.
We need to wash all the sheets.

06:55.567 --> 06:57.133
-We don't have to wash
all the sheets, do we?

06:57.167 --> 06:58.300
-Oh, I just changed
all my sheets!

06:58.333 --> 07:00.633
-Won't they be in the food?
-They're not in the food.

07:00.667 --> 07:02.567
-Why did you wait
until the middle of dinner?

07:02.600 --> 07:04.200
-You've held onto this all day?

07:04.233 --> 07:06.400
-Yeah, sorry, Josh. I just
don't think we can eat it.

07:06.433 --> 07:08.167
-Yeah, Arnold's right.
We just can't eat it.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.500
-We can eat the food
because we're gonna take
the medication later.

07:10.533 --> 07:11.967
-Oh, do you have
the medication?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.733
-Okay, yeah. Tom, I need you
to stop knowingly eating
worm eggs. Mm-hmm.

07:16.833 --> 07:18.233
-I don't have the medication.

07:18.267 --> 07:22.200
You are right, I probably
should have the medication,
but I don't.

07:22.233 --> 07:25.400
I will go and get the medication
as soon as Grace leaves.

07:25.433 --> 07:28.067
-Oh, no, Grace. What are
we gonna do about Grace?
-Grace is fine.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.800
-No, you have to tell your dad
that you gave her worms!

07:29.833 --> 07:32.100
-I'll Google what to do.
-Great.

07:32.133 --> 07:34.167
-I will go and get
the medication after dinner.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.200
-No! We're not gonna just
incubate worm eggs

07:36.233 --> 07:38.200
for another few hours
just so that you can
have dessert.

07:41.333 --> 07:42.600
-Fine.

07:42.633 --> 07:44.367
-I'll go get you some
cash for mine.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.800
-No, no. No, no.
Tom, take this. My shout.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.733
Special treat.

07:51.433 --> 07:53.567
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

07:55.700 --> 07:58.633
-Oh, Josh, could I please
talk to you for a moment?

07:59.767 --> 08:01.433
Claire, too, actually.

08:16.067 --> 08:18.100
-Are you eating off
the microwave plate?

08:18.133 --> 08:20.233
-Aren't you impressed
I found a clean plate?

08:20.267 --> 08:22.800
-(sighs) We really need
to wash some dishes.

08:22.833 --> 08:25.400
-I keep waiting for
one of your manic episodes.

08:25.433 --> 08:27.800
I put those moldy pots
in the freezer.

08:27.833 --> 08:29.633
That should hold them
at bay for a couple of days.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.500
-Looks like you guys
need a hand.

08:31.533 --> 08:34.400
-Stuart! Oh!
What are you doing here?

08:35.533 --> 08:37.367
-I wanted to come
and apologize.

08:39.233 --> 08:40.667
-Uh... apologize?

08:40.700 --> 08:42.300
-I just want to say my piece.

08:42.333 --> 08:43.433
-Okay.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.433
-I'd offer you a cup of tea,
but we're all out of cups.

08:48.467 --> 08:50.467
And solid bowls.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.200
And enthusiasm.

08:58.567 --> 08:59.700
-You fucking dogs!

08:59.733 --> 09:02.333
-Look, guys, okay,
I hear you.

09:02.367 --> 09:05.533
I do. I just really think
everything's gonna be fine.

09:05.567 --> 09:07.733
-All you had to do
was put it in her food.

09:07.767 --> 09:10.267
-Yeah... No, that's the problem.

09:10.300 --> 09:15.333
The method. The method
he is using to drug
your girlfriend.

09:15.367 --> 09:18.133
-I'm a hero, okay?
I've taken the most incredible
fall for you.

09:18.167 --> 09:19.333
-You're enabling him!

09:19.367 --> 09:21.567
-You just couldn't handle
the fact that I had the idea.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.067
So you had to change
the idea to suit you.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.700
-No, it's a good plan.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.700
-Worms is worse than chlamydia.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.600
-Is it? Is it?
-No.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.733
Please, just tell her the truth!

09:32.767 --> 09:34.367
-No, not now that
I've lied for Tom.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.267
Because then Arnold will
find out and he'll realize
what kind of people we are.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.400
-Do you actually have worms?

09:39.433 --> 09:41.300
Is this your sneaky little way

09:41.333 --> 09:43.033
of putting your worms
on my shoulders?

09:43.067 --> 09:44.667
-I don't know why
you two don't just
date each other.

09:44.700 --> 09:47.167
-You make a beautiful couple.
-16 years for a goldfish! Wow!

09:47.200 --> 09:49.733
-Well, it's very obvious
you guys are talking about me.

09:49.767 --> 09:50.900
-We weren't.
-No.

09:50.933 --> 09:52.333
-Are you blaming the worms
on me because I'm new here?

09:52.367 --> 09:55.433
-Definitely not.
-Because I really don't think
that I gave you worms.

09:55.467 --> 09:56.700
-Neither do we.

09:56.733 --> 09:58.367
-I'm sorry if I did, though.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.667
-No, I still think
it's a good plan.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.333
-Me and Hazel did split up,

10:05.367 --> 10:07.667
but then her mum died.
She was so upset,

10:07.700 --> 10:09.800
and, you know, I'm all
that she has so I took her back.

10:09.833 --> 10:12.567
I know that was a mistake.
I know it was unfair to you.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.833
But I just couldn't bear
to see her that upset.

10:15.867 --> 10:17.800
-It's very sad for Hazel.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.633
-Yeah, it was very sad.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.733
-So, have you got
anything else to say?

10:25.733 --> 10:27.200
-Just that I'm sorry.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.433
-Well, that's done then.

10:30.467 --> 10:33.167
-No! Sit down.

10:34.233 --> 10:36.267
Sit down. I'm not a bad guy.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.067
-No. (stammers)
I think you're fine.

10:38.100 --> 10:39.333
We're finished.

10:39.367 --> 10:41.133
You probably should go.

10:41.167 --> 10:43.367
-No, I'm not done.
I'm not going anywhere.

10:46.367 --> 10:48.333
-Stuart, you have to go.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.367
-How long are you
gonna do this for?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.000
-Until you forgive me.

11:04.433 --> 11:05.767
-All right.

11:08.233 --> 11:10.067
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.567
-I'm not going.
-No, come on!

11:11.600 --> 11:13.433
-I'm not done, Rose.
-Come on!

11:13.467 --> 11:15.000
Oh!

11:16.367 --> 11:17.800
-I just want you
to forgive me, Rose.

11:17.833 --> 11:19.267
-I forgive you.

11:19.300 --> 11:20.533
-That was insincere.

11:20.567 --> 11:22.233
-Oh, I forgive you!

11:22.267 --> 11:24.567
-(sighs) You're really starting
to bother me now, Rose.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.767
I'm not a well man, you need
to be very careful here.

11:28.733 --> 11:30.300
-(phone rings)

11:30.333 --> 11:32.400
-Hello, this is Josh.

11:32.433 --> 11:34.767
I am unavailable. I am too busy.
I am too busy for you.

11:34.800 --> 11:35.800
-(beeps)

11:35.833 --> 11:39.133
-Josh, uh... at the point--

11:39.167 --> 11:41.400
(sighs) To be honest,
at the point when I was accosted

11:41.433 --> 11:43.567
by your awful
voicemail greeting,

11:43.600 --> 11:46.767
I hadn't resolved my intentions
as well as you might have liked.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.667
Now it seems I've made
the same mistake twice.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.667
I don't know what I'm saying.

11:53.267 --> 11:55.300
I suggest forgetting
I ever called

11:55.333 --> 11:58.033
and maybe having
a chocolate biscuit
or something.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.567
-(sighs)

12:02.833 --> 12:04.533
-(phone rings)

12:04.567 --> 12:06.833
-Ben: Ben...
-Voicemail: ...is not available.

12:06.867 --> 12:09.000
At the tone,
please leave your message.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.767
-So...

12:11.800 --> 12:14.467
So I think what
you're trying to say--
either you're too scared

12:14.500 --> 12:18.800
or perhaps just too exhausted
because of the way you speak--

12:18.833 --> 12:22.800
uh, is that you're not sure
whether it's worth
seeing me again,

12:22.833 --> 12:25.433
but you're worried that

12:25.467 --> 12:28.800
you might never get
an opportunity to find out
in the light of day

12:28.833 --> 12:31.600
how disappointing
my face actually is.

12:31.633 --> 12:34.767
Does that, uh--
Does that sound about right?

12:44.267 --> 12:46.433
-Where have you been?
Grace won't stop crying.

12:46.467 --> 12:48.033
I was just putting the bins out.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.367
-Hi.
-(sighs)

12:51.600 --> 12:52.800
-She's fine, babe.

12:52.833 --> 12:55.200
-Yeah, she was crying so much.
I promise, she just stopped.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.200
-Okay. I mean,
I wish she was crying.

12:57.233 --> 12:59.633
Then I get to pick her up
and have a little bit
of Grace time.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.200
-I'm really very worried
about Grace.

13:01.233 --> 13:02.600
Worms love babies.

13:02.633 --> 13:04.333
-Really? Is that a thing?

13:04.367 --> 13:06.700
-Everyone loves babies.
-Maybe your dad should
come get her.

13:06.733 --> 13:08.833
-No, no. We don't want to ruin
his special night, okay?

13:08.867 --> 13:10.233
We'll tell him when he comes
to pick her up.

13:10.267 --> 13:13.233
-If she's got worms,
then your dad probably
has worms too, you know.

13:13.267 --> 13:15.833
-Sometimes I wonder how there
is anyone in the world
that doesn't have worms.

13:15.867 --> 13:19.000
-You should call Tom
and make sure that he talks
to the pharmacist about Grace.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.800
-Okay, yep.

13:21.833 --> 13:24.133
Yeah, no, that is a good idea.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.367
Be silly not to.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.533
-Yeah.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.833
-(phone rings)

13:32.867 --> 13:34.233
-(Josh sighs)

13:34.267 --> 13:36.433
(whispers) It's just ringing.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.133
Hey, buddy. Hi.

13:43.167 --> 13:44.567
-Tom:
I'm properly scared
at this point.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.667
Am I going to jail?

13:45.700 --> 13:48.200
I feel like at least some part
of today means jail.

13:48.233 --> 13:50.400
I've accepted the fact that
she's going to break up with me.

13:50.433 --> 13:52.833
That's done. Now I'm trying
to decide how I can explain
to my parents

13:52.867 --> 13:54.467
that I'm not going
to see them for a while.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.267
Yeah, we were just thinking
that it might be a good idea
for you to pick up some

13:57.300 --> 13:59.333
some baby worming
medication for Grace.

13:59.367 --> 14:00.833
-It doesn't exist.

14:00.867 --> 14:03.433
-Yeah, no, no, no.
We don't need a treat,
thank you for offering though.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.333
Gosh, what a generous guy.
What a good guy.

14:05.367 --> 14:07.333
-I can't handle this!

14:07.367 --> 14:08.767
-I love you too.

14:10.233 --> 14:12.500
-Oh, why'd you say no
to the treat?

14:13.533 --> 14:15.067
I'm starving.

14:17.467 --> 14:19.300
-Well, fine then.
I'll just go then, will I?

14:19.333 --> 14:20.567
-Okay.

14:22.467 --> 14:24.767
-Okay? That's it then,
is it? Okay.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.467
Nice knowing you.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.167
Is there something wrong
with you, Rose?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.433
There's something
wrong with your head.

14:29.467 --> 14:31.267
-Yeah, there is.

14:31.300 --> 14:33.067
That's how you guys met.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.767
-Why can't you see
that I'm a good man?

14:36.333 --> 14:38.200
-What do you think
we should do?

14:38.233 --> 14:39.700
-He'll wear himself out.

14:42.633 --> 14:45.067
-I'm seconds away
from blowing my top here.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.500
Seconds away!

14:46.533 --> 14:47.833
-Do you think
we should call the police?

14:47.867 --> 14:49.633
-No, he doesn't need
to go to prison.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.233
-(phone rings)

15:03.267 --> 15:05.033
-(phone chimes)

15:05.067 --> 15:06.300
-It's Rose.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.000
-You better answer it.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.667
-Hello, Rose.

15:11.700 --> 15:16.167
-Alan, Stuart's broken into
my house and he won't leave.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.333
-What? Well, have you
called the police?

15:18.367 --> 15:20.400
-No, no, I don't want
to get him arrested.

15:20.433 --> 15:21.567
-What's happening?

15:21.600 --> 15:23.367
-Stuart's broken into
Rose's house.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.667
She sounds scared.
She doesn't want
to call the police.

15:25.700 --> 15:28.733
-No, I'm not scared.
I just want him to leave.

15:28.767 --> 15:30.767
-Okay, okay. Let's go.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.533
-Do-- Do you think--

15:32.567 --> 15:33.800
Okay, yeah.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.400
We're coming, Rose.
We're coming.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.700
Do we need this?

15:39.733 --> 15:41.300
-What-- No, Alan!

15:41.333 --> 15:43.033
-I won't use it.
-Well, then don't bring it!

15:43.067 --> 15:44.333
-Eh, we might need it.

15:44.367 --> 15:46.433
-Okay, you are
not allowed to use this.
-No, I won't, I won't.

15:46.467 --> 15:49.333
Oh! (sighs)

15:50.867 --> 15:52.467
-(phone rings)
-(Grace babbles)

15:52.500 --> 15:53.767
-Hi, Dad.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.033
-Hi, Josh, it's Dad.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.767
-And Mae. How is Grace going?

15:56.800 --> 15:58.233
-I mean, she is an angel.

15:58.267 --> 16:02.333
-Look, Josh, Stuart's having
some sort of sit-in at
your mum's place.

16:02.367 --> 16:04.067
She and Hannah are
stuck there with him.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.767
-Oh, ok-- Okay.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.400
-Josh, is that your dad?

16:07.433 --> 16:09.200
-Yeah.
-You have to tell him
about Grace.

16:09.233 --> 16:11.267
-What? Tell him
what about Grace?

16:13.633 --> 16:17.467
-Okay, um, I have worms
and maybe Grace has worms.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.567
-Why are you telling us this?

16:20.600 --> 16:23.667
-Just, maybe Grace has worms,
and you're gonna have to
get her checked.

16:24.767 --> 16:26.267
-How did you get worms?

16:26.300 --> 16:27.600
-I don't know, who knows?

16:27.633 --> 16:29.167
It's not like they were invited.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.300
-Okay, fine.
We worm her. Okay?

16:31.333 --> 16:33.267
-(Claire laughs)
-Great.

16:33.300 --> 16:35.100
-Alan: You have to wash
all the sheets.

16:35.133 --> 16:36.267
-Yes, I know.

16:36.300 --> 16:37.733
Okay.

16:37.767 --> 16:40.200
There's no worms.
Practical joke.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.500
-What?

16:41.533 --> 16:43.433
-That's not funny, Josh.

16:43.467 --> 16:44.733
-Wait, what? There are no worms?

16:44.767 --> 16:47.033
-No, no, no, Arnold,
there are no worms.
Tom has chlamydia.

16:47.067 --> 16:48.533
-Again?
-Yeah.

16:48.567 --> 16:50.300
-How are the two related?

16:50.333 --> 16:52.667
-Does he always lie?
I thought he never lies.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.467
Maybe that's
the biggest lie of all.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.067
-Okay, well what do you want
me to do about Mum?

16:56.100 --> 16:59.467
-I'm just ringing to tell you
to make sure that you keep
you and Grace safe.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.800
-From the man at Mum's house
who's not here at my house?

17:02.833 --> 17:05.300
-Your dad is just calling

17:05.333 --> 17:07.767
because he is so excited
he might get to be a hero.

17:07.800 --> 17:08.900
-No, No, I--

17:08.933 --> 17:10.800
-You know, guys, it was
probably John who gave us worms.

17:10.833 --> 17:13.667
I'm sorry to say it,
but let's be real.
Hi, Grace.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.800
-Why is he doing this?

17:15.833 --> 17:19.200
Do I get no say on whether
my boyfriend tells people
he has worms?

17:19.233 --> 17:21.233
-This is the nicest thing
I've ever seen Josh
do for someone.

17:21.267 --> 17:23.533
-I'm calling to tell you
where we are

17:23.567 --> 17:25.700
so that if anything goes wrong,
you can call the police.

17:25.733 --> 17:28.300
-Or maybe you could
just call the police now.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.633
-Your mom doesn't want
to send him to prison.

17:30.667 --> 17:32.700
Your dad brought
a cricket bat, Josh.

17:32.733 --> 17:33.800
(laughs)
-Oh.

17:33.833 --> 17:36.033
-I'm not gonna use it.

17:36.067 --> 17:37.700
-Bye, Joshie!

17:37.733 --> 17:39.100
-(phone beeps)

17:39.133 --> 17:41.433
-Mwah! (giggles)

17:41.467 --> 17:44.300
-It was definitely John.
I've seen him licking
Josh's face.

17:44.333 --> 17:45.600
He's licked all of our faces.

17:45.633 --> 17:47.267
-What? It wasn't John,
was it, buddy?

17:47.300 --> 17:48.800
-I can see it in his eyes.

17:48.833 --> 17:50.700
Dead giveaway, John.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.167
Dead giveaway.

17:58.233 --> 17:59.500
-Tell you what,

17:59.533 --> 18:00.700
Stuart,

18:00.733 --> 18:03.300
I'll forgive you
very sincerely...

18:04.567 --> 18:06.033
if you clean the kitchen.

18:10.833 --> 18:12.300
These pills couldn't look
any less alike.

18:12.333 --> 18:13.567
How is this supposed
to trick her?

18:13.600 --> 18:15.367
-Just tell her we
took ours already.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.833
Then what was the point of me
going to the pharmacy again

18:17.867 --> 18:19.433
if she's not even
gonna see them.

18:19.467 --> 18:20.733
I had to get them
to check out the back.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.067
-I want to take them.
-If you take them,

18:22.100 --> 18:24.300
you have to pay for them.
Josh didn't give me
enough money.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.333
-Did you guys take
them without me?

18:27.367 --> 18:28.467
-Yeah.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.333
-I thought we'd
do it together, no?

18:30.367 --> 18:32.500
-Yeah, you're right. Sorry,
we should have waited.

18:34.767 --> 18:36.667
-Josh, can I have a little sip
of your beer, please?

18:36.700 --> 18:38.067
-Mm-hmm.

18:39.867 --> 18:42.100
-"Only the dead have seen
the end of war."

18:46.633 --> 18:48.000
It's a Plato quote.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.000
-(phone rings)

18:54.600 --> 18:55.833
-Alan:
Hi, Rose.

18:55.867 --> 18:58.400
-He won't budge.
I don't know what to do.

18:58.433 --> 18:59.733
-We're ten seconds away.

18:59.767 --> 19:01.033
-Stuart:
Who's that?

19:01.067 --> 19:03.400
-Rose:
It's Alan, my ex-husband.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.600
-Oh, no, it isn't.
I told you not to push me!

19:05.633 --> 19:07.333
So what now?

19:08.733 --> 19:10.467
-What are you doing?
You wanna have a go?

19:10.500 --> 19:11.700
-He's running.
-Oh, god.

19:11.733 --> 19:14.233
Get out of your car
and protect your wife
like a man!

19:14.267 --> 19:15.500
-Oh, what do we do?

19:15.533 --> 19:17.167
-Get out of the fucking car!
-Ah!

19:17.200 --> 19:18.200
-Out!

19:18.233 --> 19:19.467
-I don't think I should get out.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.400
-No, don't get out
of the car, Alan.
-Out!

19:21.433 --> 19:23.367
I suppose this is
the first time they've met.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.500
-Stuart: Fucking come on!
-It's going really well.

19:25.533 --> 19:27.067
-Get out!

19:28.067 --> 19:29.733
-Oh, Jesus.
-Out!

19:29.767 --> 19:31.333
-Um, what do we do?
-Ah!

19:31.367 --> 19:32.367
-Fucking get out!

19:32.400 --> 19:33.767
-Oh, ask him to get off?

19:33.800 --> 19:35.267
-Um...

19:36.467 --> 19:38.300
-Stuart, mate, can you--
Can you get off the car?

19:38.333 --> 19:40.100
-Not until Rose comes
and talks to me.

19:40.133 --> 19:41.533
-Get off the car!
-You shut up!

19:41.567 --> 19:42.767
-Shh! Don't talk to him.
-What?

19:42.800 --> 19:44.367
-Okay, okay.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.367
Uh, I'm just gonna take him
down the street.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.367
Rose, meet me at the curb.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.267
-Alan, you are not
a stunt driver!

19:51.300 --> 19:52.700
-No, we can do this.
-Stuart: Oi!

19:53.767 --> 19:55.200
What are you doing?

19:55.233 --> 19:56.467
Alan.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.100
Alan, don't mess around. Alan!

20:00.567 --> 20:01.700
Oy!

20:03.100 --> 20:04.500
What are you doing?

20:07.167 --> 20:10.233
Just stop there.
Just-- Just stop.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.300
I want to talk to Rose!

20:16.333 --> 20:17.767
Alan, ya prick!

20:20.233 --> 20:22.033
I just want to talk to Rose!

20:23.367 --> 20:24.600
Hey!

20:27.133 --> 20:28.200
(grunts)

20:30.067 --> 20:32.367
Slow down, you fucking lunatic!

20:32.400 --> 20:33.800
-Mae: Oh!

20:33.833 --> 20:35.500
(squealing)

20:42.733 --> 20:45.533
-Thanks for this, Alan. Hi, Mae.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.100
-Oh!
-Oh!

20:49.100 --> 20:50.533
-Tossers!

20:50.567 --> 20:52.100
Poxy tossers!

20:52.133 --> 20:55.833
-Hello, this is Josh.
I am unavailable. I am too busy.
I am too busy for you.

20:55.867 --> 20:56.800
-(beep)

20:56.833 --> 21:00.133
-Josh. Hey, I think
you might be spot on.

21:01.267 --> 21:02.767
I, uh...

21:02.800 --> 21:06.500
I'm tempted to say you don't
have to, but now you've
backed me into a corner,

21:06.533 --> 21:09.067
and I don't have much to lose.
I'm just gonna say it.

21:10.533 --> 21:11.933
Come see me at the hospital,

21:11.967 --> 21:15.233
before my aneurysm operation,
or you'll look like
a proper douche.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.033
-Ben: Ben...
-Voicemail: ...is not available.

21:19.067 --> 21:21.167
At the tone,
please leave your message.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.533
-(beep)

21:22.567 --> 21:24.400
-Um...

21:24.433 --> 21:26.433
Okay. Okay, yeah, I'll come.

21:38.533 --> 21:41.133
-Sex time.
It's sex time.

21:41.167 --> 21:46.333
-No. No, no, not tonight.
I'm just-- I'm really spent.

21:46.367 --> 21:48.500
-You're spent?

21:48.533 --> 21:51.167
-No, Ella. I'm too tired.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.267
-You're too tired for sex time?

21:53.300 --> 21:55.267
-I just--
-I'm offering you sex here.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.133
-Ella, I just don't
feel like it.

21:57.167 --> 21:58.667
-Okay, um...

21:58.700 --> 22:02.033
well, how about I'm going
to break Harold's legs if
you don't sex time me.

22:02.067 --> 22:04.133
-Don't. Don't.

22:06.500 --> 22:09.267
-Oh, Tom, why would you
do that to Harold?

22:09.300 --> 22:10.567
-I loved Harold.
-Well, now you know

22:10.600 --> 22:11.733
this isn't a game.

22:11.767 --> 22:12.800
-Ella. Stop.
-Three...

22:12.833 --> 22:14.833
two...
-Ella, just listen.

22:14.867 --> 22:18.033
I have chlamydia.

22:18.067 --> 22:20.733
Oh. Then why didn't
you just tell me?

22:20.767 --> 22:23.467
-'Cause now you're gonna
break up with me.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.167
-No, I'm not.
-Yeah, you are.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.667
-Why?
-Because of the time

22:26.700 --> 22:29.467
I lied about having
a sexual health test because
I couldn't be bothered

22:29.500 --> 22:31.533
going across the road
to buy condoms.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.133
-Oh.

22:35.400 --> 22:36.833
-Damn it!

22:36.867 --> 22:38.400
Now I have to get angry at you,

22:38.433 --> 22:41.600
and I don't want to get angry,
but I have to as a way
of respecting myself.

22:41.633 --> 22:44.033
And the frustrating
thing is that

22:44.067 --> 22:45.833
I don't know what to say,
because I can tell that you

22:45.867 --> 22:48.667
already know how bad
what you did was.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.033
Did you get symptoms?

22:51.133 --> 22:52.267
Did it hurt?

22:53.667 --> 22:55.233
Were you really scared?

22:56.400 --> 22:57.567
Okay, good.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.433
Well, if you're
in pain and fear,

22:59.467 --> 23:01.233
then I don't have to be
as angry at you.

23:01.267 --> 23:03.067
-It felt really bad.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.433
-I'm not gonna
break up with you,

23:06.467 --> 23:08.333
but I need to make sure
that you know

23:08.367 --> 23:10.567
that that doesn't mean that
I don't value myself.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.433
I value myself, okay?

23:13.467 --> 23:15.333
The reason that I'm not
going to break up with you

23:15.367 --> 23:18.633
is that I too have lied
to people for my own
selfish reasons.

23:18.667 --> 23:22.100
I'm just a better liar
than you so I got away
with it, okay?

23:22.133 --> 23:23.767
I understand why you lied,

23:23.800 --> 23:25.267
but I don't like it.

23:25.300 --> 23:28.233
And if I was the type
of person to get angry,

23:28.267 --> 23:33.200
then this is a situation where
I might slap you or maybe
scratch your neck, okay?

23:33.233 --> 23:34.467
-Okay.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.800
-Okay? Good.

23:35.833 --> 23:37.667
-I'm really sorry.
-Mm-hmm.

23:37.700 --> 23:39.433
I do have good news.

23:39.467 --> 23:40.567
What's that?

23:40.600 --> 23:43.167
I already disinfected you
and you don't have worms.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.533
That pill was
chlamydia medication?

23:44.567 --> 23:46.267
-Yes.
-That's clever.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.667
-It wasn't my idea.

23:51.833 --> 23:55.267
-I need you to know
that while I am touched
by the gesture,

23:55.300 --> 23:57.100
what you did today

23:57.133 --> 23:58.500
was very, very sneaky.

23:58.533 --> 24:00.600
-Oh, no.
-And I will get my revenge.

24:00.633 --> 24:02.267
-No.
-How did Tom ruin it?

24:02.300 --> 24:05.100
-I wanted to have sex
and there's a seven day window
where he's still contagious.

24:05.133 --> 24:08.100
I mean, we did not think
this through at all.

24:08.133 --> 24:09.300
-Nope.

24:09.333 --> 24:10.400
-Hey, Josh.

24:10.433 --> 24:11.433
-Yes, Ella?

24:11.467 --> 24:15.433
-Um, can you feel my
possibly contagious vagina

24:15.467 --> 24:17.667
pressing against
your homosexual thigh?

24:17.700 --> 24:19.100
-Yes.

24:19.133 --> 24:21.267
(groans)

24:21.300 --> 24:22.800
-I have exacted
my revenge.

24:24.467 --> 24:25.633
Good night!

24:25.667 --> 24:27.033
-Good night.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.533
-Aw!

24:34.233 --> 24:37.033
-* When, when you smiled

24:37.067 --> 24:39.300
* When you smiled at me

24:39.333 --> 24:42.067
* Well, well, I know

24:42.100 --> 24:44.633
* Our love will always be

24:44.667 --> 24:47.167
* When, when you kissed

24:47.200 --> 24:49.300
* When you kissed me right

24:49.333 --> 24:52.233
* I-- I don't want

24:52.267 --> 24:54.300
* To ever say good night
