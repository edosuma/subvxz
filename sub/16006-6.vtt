00:01.299 --> 00:04.147
That beach house
doesn't belong to Alex Moreno.

00:04.155 --> 00:07.519
No.26 is owned by a company
called Blue and White Holdings.

00:07.564 --> 00:10.328
The director of that company
is Steven Blakely.

00:10.340 --> 00:11.538
Steve Blakely knew Moreno?

00:11.592 --> 00:14.568
I've found dozens of photos of naked
children taken in the same house.

00:14.584 --> 00:17.584
The question is, did he know
what Moreno was doing there?

00:17.600 --> 00:19.548
We're going to be great parents.

00:19.564 --> 00:22.588
Isn't that what everybody thinks?
Probably.

00:23.504 --> 00:25.588
Some of us have got to be right,
statistically.

00:26.504 --> 00:30.532
Unfortunate when our private desires
conflict with our public duties.

00:30.548 --> 00:34.536
I'd tread very carefully
if I were you, Miss King.

00:35.572 --> 00:38.504
Thank you for the warning,
Judge Renmark.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.544
Miss King?

02:00.516 --> 02:02.588
Constable Payne.
We met last night.

02:02.943 --> 02:04.923
You OK?

02:04.935 --> 02:06.923
I'm fine.

02:13.240 --> 02:17.312
Sorry. You're meant
to be at Crime Command by 8:30.

02:20.272 --> 02:22.244
Yeah, right.

02:22.256 --> 02:23.292
Can you just...

02:23.304 --> 02:25.264
Yep, we'll be outside.

02:35.260 --> 02:39.256
We've compiled a list of people
who might hold a grudge against you.

02:39.268 --> 02:41.256
Mostly crooks you've prosecuted.

02:41.272 --> 02:44.033
If you could help us narrow it down,
or maybe add anyone we've missed.

02:44.228 --> 02:46.248
I don't need this.
I know who did it - Alex Moreno.

02:46.264 --> 02:49.296
You've secured a conviction
against...

02:49.308 --> 02:52.248
He was acquitted.

02:52.260 --> 02:53.312
What of?

02:53.324 --> 02:56.296
He's a photographer. Grooming kids.

02:58.272 --> 03:00.256
A photographer?

03:00.268 --> 03:01.308
Bombings like this,

03:01.324 --> 03:04.244
our first guess is always going to
be gang-related.

03:04.260 --> 03:06.272
Do you have anything to suggest
gang involvement?

03:06.288 --> 03:09.316
It's early days. Forensics will
come back with the preliminaries.

03:10.228 --> 03:11.309
I have a name now - Moreno.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.308
He was questioned about
his connection

03:13.324 --> 03:15.308
with Steven Blakely,
at my prompting.

03:15.324 --> 03:17.320
Within 48 hours,
this came back at me.

03:18.236 --> 03:20.312
Miss King,
we appreciate your frustration...

03:20.324 --> 03:22.260
No, you don't, otherwise

03:22.276 --> 03:26.240
you wouldn't be patronising me,
you'd be out, now, arresting Moreno.

03:26.256 --> 03:27.936
Janet, we have nothing
to link him to this.

03:28.228 --> 03:30.268
Then find a link.
I want you to do something!

03:30.284 --> 03:32.292
I know it's hard, but you have to
trust us here, OK?

03:32.304 --> 03:35.260
We know how to do our jobs.

03:35.272 --> 03:37.320
I will put Moreno on our list.

03:37.864 --> 03:40.304
What I need you to do is go through
all the potential suspects

03:40.316 --> 03:43.236
and start eliminating people.

03:43.248 --> 03:45.280
Then you leave the rest to us, OK?

03:55.320 --> 03:59.244
All your bank accounts have been
frozen, ATM cards stopped.

03:59.256 --> 04:01.236
If you need cash, just ask us.

04:01.252 --> 04:03.268
Your old mobile phone's been
deactivated.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.232
You can use the pre-pays we supply.

04:05.248 --> 04:07.272
Otherwise, we're going to leave you
alone here at work.

04:07.284 --> 04:09.248
It's a very secure building.

04:12.256 --> 04:15.256
Not much to say at times like this.

04:15.268 --> 04:16.303
Not really.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.308
Bastards.
Yeah.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.308
Look, are you up for a chat?

04:21.324 --> 04:25.272
You're suggesting she go
into hiding, that's your solution?

04:25.288 --> 04:27.264
If you want her
to be completely safe...

04:27.280 --> 04:29.260
I want you to do your job
and protect her.

04:29.276 --> 04:31.304
Which is why we're here
and not in your office.

04:31.320 --> 04:35.260
If you want to be extra-safe,
we can always move her interstate.

04:38.232 --> 04:41.280
..someone tried to kill Janet
with a bomb.

04:45.268 --> 04:47.292
There's no danger
to the rest of your staff.

04:47.308 --> 04:49.256
Jack will provide watertight
security.

04:49.268 --> 04:50.320
Not on my budget, I won't.

04:51.236 --> 04:53.260
Fine! I'll formalise that
with the Police Minister.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.236
Right now, getting Miss King back
to work should be our first priority.

04:56.248 --> 04:57.312
We will not be intimidated!

04:57.324 --> 05:00.228
Assuming Ms King agrees.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.276
Janet?

05:04.324 --> 05:07.304
Yeah, sure, I'll go back to work.

05:07.320 --> 05:11.244
How long before I can be with Ash
and the kids?

05:13.312 --> 05:18.228
We've got to complete
a full risk assessment.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.320
Couple of weeks,
a month at the most.

05:38.316 --> 05:40.320
Something's wrong.

05:41.236 --> 05:43.248
Let it go.
No. Can't.

05:48.316 --> 05:51.240
You ran the Blakely murder
trial.

05:51.256 --> 05:53.260
Someone's making porn
at our beach house?

05:53.276 --> 05:56.228
Yes.
Why should the automatic assumption

05:56.244 --> 05:59.324
be that my father had something to
do with this? It could be anyone.

06:06.256 --> 06:09.284
We believe the photo was taken
with a hidden camera.

06:09.296 --> 06:11.256
The girl is Alex Moreno's daughter.

06:11.272 --> 06:15.236
Her father was the child groomer,
the one Renmark acquitted.

06:15.248 --> 06:16.324
The photographer?

06:31.256 --> 06:33.304
Do you think our father
is a child pornographer?

06:33.316 --> 06:36.240
It might not be your father.

06:36.256 --> 06:38.272
It might be someone
associated with him.

06:38.288 --> 06:41.268
This is what we're trying to
establish.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.236
Renmark's judgements.

06:54.252 --> 06:56.276
Can you look at them for me?
I've got to head out.

06:56.288 --> 06:57.308
How are you?

06:57.324 --> 07:00.232
Look specifically at
sexual offences against minors,

07:00.248 --> 07:02.252
whether Renmark treats them
any differently.

07:02.272 --> 07:05.296
I was going to pop my head in before, but
Tony said we should give you some space.

07:05.312 --> 07:07.308
Richard.
How's Ash? Is she...

07:07.324 --> 07:09.308
I'm just keeping track
of who's in and who's out.

07:09.324 --> 07:12.276
Can you let me know when you'll be
going over to see Justice Renmark?

07:12.292 --> 07:13.812
I wasn't planning
on seeing him at all.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.320
Well, that is
a courageous decision.

07:17.232 --> 07:18.284
Sorry, courageous?

07:18.300 --> 07:21.276
We all know silence can
be interpreted as a sign

07:21.288 --> 07:23.272
that one has something to hide.

07:23.288 --> 07:25.304
I don't have anything to hide
about Janet and Erin.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.236
I respect a man who's
willing to take that chance,

07:28.252 --> 07:32.248
regardless of what his friends
and colleagues may think.

07:35.264 --> 07:36.312
Alright? OK.

07:40.312 --> 07:44.232
Can you stay on your man please,
Jack? Stay on your man.

07:44.244 --> 07:46.264
Beautiful pass there, Connor.

07:52.296 --> 07:54.244
Can you...

07:55.304 --> 07:58.232
Um, I appreciate you seeing me.

07:58.248 --> 08:00.260
Yeah. How are you?
Did you find out who did it?

08:00.272 --> 08:02.320
Not for sure. Look, Maya, I just...

08:05.268 --> 08:07.240
We're both involved in this somehow.

08:07.256 --> 08:09.292
There's some sort of a connection,
so I need your help.

08:09.308 --> 08:11.320
I've told you everything
that I know.

08:12.148 --> 08:14.228
Have you? Because we had a
conversation in my office,

08:14.244 --> 08:17.288
and I saw something in you,
some sort of a shift.

08:17.308 --> 08:21.236
Was that the conversation when you
accused my father of being a
paedophile?

08:21.256 --> 08:24.696
I know it's hard to come to terms
with the idea of your father doing
that sort of thing.

08:25.232 --> 08:29.288
Do you think? I'm just trying to
make sense of this.

08:29.304 --> 08:34.232
How can you be so on our side one
day, and then just so against us?

08:34.248 --> 08:36.292
It's not a matter of being
for or against.

08:36.304 --> 08:38.251
There are people trying to kill me.

08:38.264 --> 08:40.251
And that's my dad's fault?

08:40.268 --> 08:43.240
Oh, no, wait, he's dead,
so that makes it hard.

08:43.251 --> 08:44.288
There's still a connection.

08:44.300 --> 08:47.240
That is bullshit. It's bullshit.

08:47.252 --> 08:50.248
I know I've asked you this before,

08:50.264 --> 08:53.296
but please, if you know anything
at all about Alex Moreno,

08:53.308 --> 08:56.228
you need to tell me.

08:57.316 --> 09:00.264
Both our families are being attacked
by someone,

09:00.280 --> 09:02.276
and I'm sure he has something
to do with it,

09:02.292 --> 09:05.300
I just don't know what
his involvement is.

09:10.236 --> 09:12.280
I can't help you. I can't help you.

09:15.324 --> 09:18.280
Push him left, Jack, please.

09:25.276 --> 09:27.308
OK, stay on your man, Connor.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.324
This is not a good day for you.

09:49.324 --> 09:51.288
I'll leave you to it.

09:55.308 --> 09:58.228
Hello?
Hello?

09:59.260 --> 10:00.320
Hi.

10:01.236 --> 10:03.288
God, it's so good
to hear your voice.

10:05.276 --> 10:07.244
You too.

10:07.256 --> 10:08.292
Are you OK, safe?

10:10.244 --> 10:11.292
Yeah, yeah, fine.

10:16.252 --> 10:17.316
How are the kids?

10:18.232 --> 10:23.232
Good. I mean, they're a bit ratty,
but they miss you.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.292
So, where are you staying?

10:30.292 --> 10:32.272
I'm not supposed to say.

10:32.284 --> 10:34.312
No, me neither. I forgot.

10:36.324 --> 10:40.288
Do they have any ideas yet
about who might have done this?

10:40.304 --> 10:43.240
Not yet.
Do you have any ideas?

10:45.252 --> 10:48.256
I thought I did, but I don't know.

10:48.268 --> 10:50.228
So, what's the plan?

10:50.244 --> 10:52.304
I mean, how long do we have to stay
in these places?

10:52.316 --> 10:55.288
I don't know, Ash. I just...

10:55.300 --> 10:57.256
I don't know.

11:00.308 --> 11:02.260
Have you had dinner?

11:03.268 --> 11:05.304
My minder bought me some Thai.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.260
Nice?

11:07.272 --> 11:08.308
Looks oily.

11:22.276 --> 11:24.260
You should go to them.

11:24.272 --> 11:26.264
They'll keep for a moment.

11:29.284 --> 11:31.284
Ash, I'm so sorry about your job.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.260
Oh God, Janet...
About everything.

11:33.276 --> 11:35.320
About the way this has come out.
It'll be alright.

11:36.232 --> 11:38.260
In the end, it will be alright.

11:40.228 --> 11:43.288
I'd put the kids on, but the last
thing you need right now
is a burst eardrum.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.312
I love you.

11:49.304 --> 11:51.288
Me too.

11:51.300 --> 11:54.268
And you'll see, it won't be long.

12:11.236 --> 12:13.316
Terrific. Now to each other.

12:14.228 --> 12:15.264
Big smiles. Yep.

12:18.268 --> 12:20.248
Just relax for a second.

12:20.264 --> 12:23.236
There's a champagne in the car.
I'll just be a couple of minutes.

12:24.300 --> 12:27.276
The artist at work.
Yes.

12:27.292 --> 12:31.284
So those details I gave you
about the real-estate agent

12:31.300 --> 12:34.264
that handled the rental for the
beach house,

12:34.280 --> 12:36.268
that all check out OK?
As far as I know.

12:37.292 --> 12:42.232
So I rented a house and some creep
photographed my daughter.

12:42.244 --> 12:44.260
We're the victims here, right?

12:44.272 --> 12:46.248
That's the theory, yeah.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.341
So what are you doing here?

12:48.228 --> 12:50.248
You said,
on the night Steve Blakely died,

12:50.264 --> 12:53.292
you drove down to Coogee,
walked your dog all by yourself.

12:53.304 --> 12:55.244
Yeah, that's right.

12:55.260 --> 12:59.284
Toll tags show us that
you do that trip pretty regularly.

12:59.296 --> 13:01.256
When I can.

13:01.272 --> 13:05.244
But on the night Blakely was
murdered, you didn't use the tollway.

13:05.256 --> 13:07.324
I probably went a different way.

13:08.324 --> 13:11.276
Yesterday, between 7 and 9pm,
where were you?

13:11.292 --> 13:14.300
Why?
Just a straightforward question.

13:14.316 --> 13:19.308
I've got an exhibition on at the
North Sydney Gallery of Modern Art.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.320
It was my opening night yesterday.

13:22.236 --> 13:25.232
I was doing a Q and A
in front of about 100 guests.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.288
So can I get back to work now?

13:30.264 --> 13:33.324
You have a think about which way
you drove down to Coogee.

13:33.707 --> 13:35.308
You'd be amazed
what we can do these days

13:35.324 --> 13:40.236
to prove which way a vehicle
travelled... or didn't travel.

13:48.284 --> 13:51.292
I'm sorry about my behaviour
yesterday.

13:53.260 --> 13:57.272
After I went home, I kept thinking
about what you said.

13:57.284 --> 13:58.320
I appreciate that.

14:03.248 --> 14:04.324
There you go.

14:05.240 --> 14:12.248
You think my father was cooperating
with this Moreno person?

14:13.312 --> 14:15.308
In some way, yes.

14:18.280 --> 14:23.292
So if that's right,
there could be more people involved.

14:23.304 --> 14:25.240
It's possible.

14:31.308 --> 14:33.256
Maya?

14:37.240 --> 14:41.324
There are some things that
happened to me when I was little.

14:45.256 --> 14:47.296
There was a couple...

14:47.308 --> 14:49.244
..the Nelsons.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.244
They used to babysit us.

14:52.260 --> 14:55.296
My mum and dad did
the same for their kids

14:55.308 --> 14:58.256
when the Nelsons had something on.

14:58.268 --> 15:00.288
Mr Nelson, Keith...

15:04.256 --> 15:06.228
..did things to me.

15:07.260 --> 15:08.324
How long ago was this?

15:10.240 --> 15:12.288
I remember, the first time it
happened,

15:12.304 --> 15:15.244
I was wearing my fairy-penguin
pyjamas.

15:15.256 --> 15:18.240
They were still really new.

15:18.256 --> 15:21.260
I got them for my seventh birthday,
so...

15:25.240 --> 15:28.232
Mr Nelson, he was a friend of your
father's or...

15:28.248 --> 15:30.316
I went to preschool with Becky,
his daughter.

15:31.228 --> 15:33.260
Mum and Dad, they met them there,

15:33.276 --> 15:37.284
and yeah, we were all really close
for a while.

15:37.296 --> 15:40.288
I even called him Uncle Keith.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.300
And you've never told anybody
about this?

15:48.288 --> 15:50.276
I just wanted to forget it.

15:50.292 --> 15:54.240
I mean, what point is there,
really, in...

15:55.296 --> 15:58.264
..in digging all of these things up?

16:00.240 --> 16:03.236
And then you said that stuff
about my dad...

16:05.256 --> 16:10.300
..and I started wondering
about whether maybe he knew...

16:12.248 --> 16:18.256
..because later, in my teens, Dad,
he looked after me a lot

16:18.272 --> 16:21.316
and he taught me to be
really strong.

16:22.228 --> 16:24.232
And now I just don't know...

16:27.256 --> 16:29.288
..if that was 'cause he knew...

16:31.248 --> 16:35.316
..or if it's just that he sensed
that I was really struggling.

16:41.308 --> 16:43.256
I don't know.

16:48.248 --> 16:50.284
Moreno rents Steven Blakely's
holiday house.

16:50.300 --> 16:54.252
Moreno's daughter gets photographed
there by hidden cameras

16:54.264 --> 16:55.464
probably installed by Blakely.

16:56.228 --> 16:59.268
Now it turns out that Blakely's
daughter has been sexually assaulted
for years

16:59.280 --> 17:01.248
by one of his best mates,

17:01.264 --> 17:03.288
who is now a senior executive
in the public service.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.240
It could be a coincidence.

17:05.256 --> 17:07.256
Bullshit. We've got a
child-pornography ring

17:07.276 --> 17:11.252
involving a prominent group
of people, with Steven Blakely
in the centre.

17:11.268 --> 17:15.243
Things go wrong with his dying wife.
Suddenly he's facing jail.

17:15.260 --> 17:17.260
His associates get nervous
that he might talk.

17:17.271 --> 17:19.288
They try and shut him up. Possible?

17:19.304 --> 17:22.276
It's possible.
I start wondering where Moreno was

17:22.291 --> 17:25.268
on the night Blakely was killed,
and our car gets bombed.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.316
There's your conspiracy.

17:27.228 --> 17:28.628
Moreno has an alibi for that night.

17:29.236 --> 17:31.236
And Moreno, Nelson -
no histories of violence.

17:31.252 --> 17:32.732
God knows where
they'd get explosives.

17:33.236 --> 17:35.320
They hired someone.
It's bloody hard to see how.

17:36.240 --> 17:39.284
There's nothing in Moreno's phone
records or bank records
to back that up.

17:39.296 --> 17:41.268
Nelson arranged it.

17:41.284 --> 17:45.248
Janet, if I go to Terry Renner
with this, without any evidence,

17:45.264 --> 17:47.316
he is going to call me crazy
and laugh in my face.

17:48.183 --> 17:49.264
Then go over Renner's head.

17:49.280 --> 17:54.272
Where I'll get the exact same
reaction, only without the laughter.

17:54.288 --> 17:59.236
Keith Nelson is a highly respected
public servant.

18:01.300 --> 18:03.284
Who's got a lot to lose.

18:03.300 --> 18:08.228
Once he's charged, comes under
pressure, he'll want to make a deal.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.228
He will have to name names.

18:10.244 --> 18:13.240
But Janet's conspiracy theory does
sound far-fetched,

18:13.256 --> 18:16.260
and Nelson does have friends
and contacts in the media.

18:16.280 --> 18:20.280
Until we have some concrete
evidence, I suggest
it's just a sex crime

18:20.296 --> 18:23.316
and we keep this discussion
to ourselves.

18:57.292 --> 18:59.240
What?

19:01.288 --> 19:03.236
How dare you.

19:03.252 --> 19:05.240
Mr Nelson...
You're accusing me of things

19:05.256 --> 19:08.256
that supposedly happened
15 years ago, without any evidence,

19:08.272 --> 19:10.244
and you expect me
to take them seriously?

19:10.260 --> 19:12.244
They're serious allegations.
15 years.

19:12.260 --> 19:15.268
Maya Blakely was a child
at the time, a small child.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.264
I understand.
It's a bloody witch-hunt.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.292
The Blakelys are both dead.
You expect me to what?

19:19.308 --> 19:22.232
Mr Nelson!
You leave me hanging.

19:22.248 --> 19:25.276
Mr Nelson, are you refusing to
cooperate with this investigation?

19:28.240 --> 19:31.260
I'm going to put the question
to you again.

19:31.280 --> 19:35.320
Did you engage in sexual activity
with Maya Blakely when she was a
minor?

19:36.236 --> 19:39.280
Never! Anybody who says I did
is a fucking liar.

19:41.264 --> 19:43.312
Forensics are still
trawling through his computers,

19:43.324 --> 19:45.260
but it's not looking promising.

19:45.276 --> 19:47.312
However, we did find this
in his desk in a locked drawer -

19:47.324 --> 19:49.260
a 32-GB USB stick.

19:49.272 --> 19:50.308
Full of child porn?

19:50.320 --> 19:52.296
Completely empty.

19:52.312 --> 19:55.276
When I say empty,
I mean really empty.

19:55.296 --> 19:58.304
Forensics can usually retrieve
images even when they've been
deleted,

19:58.320 --> 20:01.292
but this has been scrubbed
using very sophisticated software.

20:01.308 --> 20:04.244
So it's Nelson's word against Maya's.
Not quite.

20:04.264 --> 20:07.284
In her statement, Maya described
an identifying mark on Nelson's
penis,

20:07.300 --> 20:10.272
a birthmark
shaped like a map of England.

20:10.284 --> 20:11.324
'I know it sounds strange,

20:11.991 --> 20:14.272
but I remember thinking of the map
on the wall at school.'

20:14.288 --> 20:17.260
That's your case. If Maya's right,
and he has a mark like that...

20:17.276 --> 20:19.296
How do I find that out,
pants him in front of the jury?

20:19.312 --> 20:21.308
Maybe you should get a search
warrant.

20:21.324 --> 20:23.324
Can you get a warrant
for a man's undies?

20:24.240 --> 20:26.232
It's got to be a court order,
I suppose.

20:26.248 --> 20:28.256
Still 15 years old.
It makes it extremely difficult.

20:28.268 --> 20:29.304
It's winnable.

20:29.320 --> 20:33.284
If you're so passionate about it,
why aren't you running it?

20:33.300 --> 20:36.324
Janet was the first one
to hear Maya's story.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.304
Oh, so you're a witness.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.292
I told her we'd put our second-best
person on it.

20:41.304 --> 20:43.296
I'm flattered.

20:43.312 --> 20:48.296
I hope you can stick around so I can
pick your brain as this evolves.

20:48.308 --> 20:50.256
Now I'm flattered.

20:50.276 --> 20:54.312
I might be just looking for someone
to share the blame
if it doesn't get up.

20:55.228 --> 21:00.280
Now we just sit back and allow
things to take their course. Agreed?

21:00.292 --> 21:02.228
Agreed.

21:08.324 --> 21:12.312
Things only get to my desk
when the damage is done.

21:13.228 --> 21:17.280
I can't make any difference at all.
I'm completely impotent.

21:29.272 --> 21:32.312
Get away from her.
Get the fuck away from her!

21:32.668 --> 21:34.308
That's what you did in Adelaide,
isn't it?

21:34.320 --> 21:37.252
You're a filthy fucking rapist!

21:52.308 --> 21:54.256
Here.

21:56.236 --> 21:58.288
My letter of resignation.

21:58.304 --> 22:01.288
I thought
I should make it easy for you.

22:02.324 --> 22:06.316
Well, a perfectly honourable
course of action.

22:07.228 --> 22:08.284
I thought so too.

22:11.252 --> 22:13.308
I've made us all look terrible.

22:14.308 --> 22:17.320
Well, you're barely an apprentice
at that pastime.

22:18.236 --> 22:22.300
Janet's had a crack, Tracey's month
in court was a standout

22:22.316 --> 22:25.284
and my performance
in the Vasilich appeal

22:25.296 --> 22:28.264
was definitely a podium finish.

22:28.276 --> 22:31.276
You made a mistake. We all do.

22:32.276 --> 22:34.312
Learn from it.

22:34.324 --> 22:37.280
I don't trust myself anymore.

22:38.304 --> 22:41.284
Well, I trust you,
and I outrank you.

22:42.284 --> 22:46.260
Consequently,
I decline to accept this.

22:46.276 --> 22:50.284
In fact, a brief's just come in -
sexual assault, minor, 15 years old.

22:50.304 --> 22:55.240
Please, Tony, if I'm staying,
at least transfer me out
of Sex Crimes.

22:55.256 --> 22:57.252
To what, Homicide? First grisly
murder that comes in,

22:57.268 --> 22:59.240
you'll be begging
to get out of that, too.

22:59.252 --> 23:01.304
Next thing, you're a wasted talent

23:01.320 --> 23:05.292
doing drink-driving
and contested speed fines.

23:05.308 --> 23:09.268
What you did,
you did out of passion.

23:10.268 --> 23:14.232
We need more of that around here,
not less.

23:20.292 --> 23:23.316
You'll hear from Tracey
about that brief.

23:25.236 --> 23:27.260
You make sure it goes to trial.

23:54.312 --> 23:56.280
Ah, Richard.

23:56.292 --> 23:58.228
You going in?

23:58.240 --> 23:59.276
Yeah.

23:59.288 --> 24:01.272
What did you, um...

24:01.288 --> 24:04.268
Oh, nothing.
One hug, that's all I saw.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.316
Completely innocent.

24:06.232 --> 24:09.248
Be careful, though,
he's a tricky bastard.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.304
So, Mr Stirling.

24:15.320 --> 24:18.264
You've worked with Miss King
and Miss O'Shaughnessy

24:18.276 --> 24:20.236
a number of times, is that correct?

24:20.252 --> 24:23.232
I suppose so.
Is it a matter of supposition?

24:23.244 --> 24:24.280
No, it's a fact.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.320
And how would you describe
their relationship?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.280
Professional, very professional.

24:29.296 --> 24:32.300
Others I've spoken to have said
they're extremely close.

24:32.316 --> 24:36.296
Well yes, extremely close
in a professional sort of way.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.232
I mean, friendly, you know?

24:39.244 --> 24:40.280
Just friendly?

24:40.292 --> 24:42.264
No, I guess...

24:42.280 --> 24:44.316
Erin virtually delivered
Janet's babies,

24:45.228 --> 24:47.268
so maybe more than just friendly.

24:47.284 --> 24:51.280
Delivering someone's babies,
I'd call that intimate.

24:53.252 --> 24:54.300
I suppose so.

24:54.316 --> 24:58.280
Obviously, at one level,
it's extremely intimate.

24:58.296 --> 25:00.308
It's an intimate experience,
birthing babies.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.312
If you do that with someone,

25:03.228 --> 25:07.264
it inevitably gives rise to
a kind of intimacy, obviously.

25:07.280 --> 25:11.272
So initially you described their
relationship as professional,

25:11.288 --> 25:15.292
but now you'd like to revise that
to 'extremely intimate.'

25:17.248 --> 25:19.264
You went and talked to Renmark
So what?

25:19.280 --> 25:22.292
As long as you told him the truth,
there's no need to apologise.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.256
Is there?
Of course I told the truth,

25:26.272 --> 25:29.304
but it's all about emphasis,
and my emphasis was less than ideal.

25:29.320 --> 25:34.228
You worry too much. Anyway, on the
subject of Renmark...

25:34.244 --> 25:37.280
Yes. I went through all
his old judgements,

25:37.296 --> 25:40.296
everything since he went to the
bench. My office? OK.

25:43.300 --> 25:46.316
I didn't find anything unusual
in the sexual assaults,

25:47.232 --> 25:49.248
in that they conform
to the overall trends.

25:49.264 --> 25:51.288
But it's the trends themselves
that are bizarre.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.236
I've graphed it all by year.

25:53.252 --> 25:56.248
In his first few years at the bench,
there's no strong trend.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.300
Acquittal-to-conviction ratio
is about average.

26:00.732 --> 26:04.760
But then, the Criminal Procedure Act
is amended,

26:05.676 --> 26:08.700
massively increasing the number
of judge-only trials,

26:08.716 --> 26:10.744
and suddenly, he's acquitting just
about everyone.

26:10.756 --> 26:12.700
I thought he was pro-prosecution.

26:12.716 --> 26:15.716
That came later. In the first few
years after the Act was amended,

26:15.728 --> 26:18.712
- he was the exact opposite.
- Your interpretation?

26:18.728 --> 26:20.569
For a lazy judge hearing a case
without a jury,

26:20.617 --> 26:22.577
the easiest option is to acquit.

26:22.593 --> 26:25.613
There's no appeal, so the decision's
less likely to come under scrutiny.

26:25.629 --> 26:27.621
You don't spend hours
drafting a judgement.

26:27.992 --> 26:29.593
You're home for an early dinner.
Exactly.

26:29.609 --> 26:32.577
What's interesting is that then,
his record changes again.

26:32.593 --> 26:35.553
Suddenly he's convicting everyone
that comes before him.

26:35.569 --> 26:37.545
So there's nearly a 100%
conviction rate

26:37.561 --> 26:39.537
for the last 18 months
until Moreno.

26:39.553 --> 26:41.589
It could be explained away as
a statistical variation.

26:41.605 --> 26:44.545
It's more than that. It has to be.
What do you mean by weird?

26:44.561 --> 26:47.613
How can we know it's weird unless
we compare judgements with evidence?

26:47.629 --> 26:50.553
You want me to trawl through the
trial transcripts in detail,

26:50.569 --> 26:51.617
look for any specific
irregularities?

26:51.629 --> 26:53.617
I know it's a huge and tedious job.

26:54.533 --> 26:58.601
Tedious? I already made a start,
just out of personal interest.

26:58.621 --> 27:02.605
At the very least, it suggests a
judge who's pursuing a personal
agenda.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.617
That's not an agenda, that's
corruption.

27:05.629 --> 27:08.545
How'd you get onto this, Janet?

27:10.545 --> 27:13.605
Danny Novak made a comment
about Renmark's decision in Moreno.

27:13.617 --> 27:15.629
What is it that Mr Novak had to say?

27:16.545 --> 27:19.549
It was extremely vague, but he implie
the result in the case was dodgy.

27:21.565 --> 27:22.613
Why tell you?

27:22.629 --> 27:26.589
He knew you had him in the frame
for Steven Blakely's murder.

27:26.601 --> 27:28.589
He said he had nothing to do with it,

27:28.605 --> 27:31.617
and suggested I find out
how Moreno was acquitted.

27:31.629 --> 27:33.589
And you just believed him?

27:33.601 --> 27:35.561
I wasn't sure at first,

27:35.577 --> 27:37.549
then I asked you guys
to look into Moreno,

27:37.565 --> 27:39.601
next thing I know, my car blows up
outside my fucking house

27:39.613 --> 27:41.617
and nearly kills my entire family.

27:42.505 --> 27:44.585
So yes, funnily enough,
I am inclined to believe him.

27:44.597 --> 27:46.565
Let's just assume for a moment

27:46.581 --> 27:50.553
that Renmark's decisions weren't
based on the evidence in front of him

27:50.565 --> 27:52.557
but to please someone else.

27:52.573 --> 27:54.597
Was someone paying him
or blackmailing him?

27:54.613 --> 27:57.617
A senior New South Wales
public official corrupted?

27:57.629 --> 27:59.601
Not entirely without precedent.

27:59.617 --> 28:02.593
Who gains by having all these idiots
convicted?

28:02.609 --> 28:04.577
I'm sure the police are
on top of the list.

28:04.589 --> 28:05.625
Or a policeman.

28:06.541 --> 28:08.549
Since we're playing hypotheticals,
sure.

28:08.565 --> 28:11.605
Back in the '80s, we would have
been the number-one suspects,

28:11.625 --> 28:15.561
but if anyone in Crime Command
had a judge in their pockets
these days,

28:15.573 --> 28:16.609
even Steve Blakely,

28:16.625 --> 28:20.533
I would have heard a whisper about
it somewhere down the line.

28:20.549 --> 28:21.629
Fair point.
So forget us.

28:22.545 --> 28:26.537
Let's ask the important question -
who are the really good corrupters?

28:26.553 --> 28:29.609
Organised crime. But wouldn't they
want their mates acquitted?

28:29.625 --> 28:32.625
Mates? They dog each other
all the time.

28:33.541 --> 28:36.561
The Danny Novaks of this world
want to eliminate enemies,

28:36.573 --> 28:37.625
get rid of competition.

28:38.541 --> 28:41.561
Well, politically sensitive
business, going after a judge.

28:41.577 --> 28:43.937
Sure is, which is why I'm gonna need
something very concrete

28:44.533 --> 28:46.549
before I launch into
a formal investigation.

28:46.561 --> 28:48.549
When I get it, I'll be back.

28:48.565 --> 28:51.609
Janet,
thanks for coming to me with this.

28:57.621 --> 29:02.621
See? You're walking into court, just
like you've done a million times.

29:03.537 --> 29:06.577
No-one's giving you a second glance.
You'll be fine.

29:06.593 --> 29:10.549
I feel like a kid going back to clas
after detention.

29:10.561 --> 29:12.541
You can handle it.

29:12.557 --> 29:16.585
When it gets down to the
nitty-gritty, just stay detached.

29:16.601 --> 29:19.569
Just deal with the facts of the
case, that's all.

29:19.585 --> 29:21.549
If you think your job's bad,
remember,

29:21.561 --> 29:22.761
when you win this court order,

29:23.545 --> 29:26.537
I've got to watch a guy
get his dick photographed.

29:26.553 --> 29:29.601
I think we know who's got second
prize in this one today.

29:29.617 --> 29:31.617
Given Miss Blakely's clear
recollection

29:31.629 --> 29:34.533
of such an identifying mark,

29:34.549 --> 29:36.557
we make application to the court
to grant an order

29:36.573 --> 29:39.553
under the Forensic Procedures Act,
requiring Mr Nelson

29:39.573 --> 29:42.553
to undergo an intimate bodily
examination, specifically
of his penis.

29:42.569 --> 29:45.573
Your Honour, Mr Nelson is an
upstanding citizen and family man

29:45.589 --> 29:47.549
whose reputation has already been
severely damaged

29:47.561 --> 29:48.621
by these allegations.

29:49.533 --> 29:50.621
Now he's expected to submit

29:51.537 --> 29:53.297
to an unnecessary and humiliating
bodily exam

29:53.437 --> 29:54.597
without any reasonable basis.

29:54.613 --> 29:57.581
It'll be carried out by a qualified
forensic medical officer,

29:57.597 --> 30:00.609
no more humiliating than
an ordinary trip to the doctor.

30:00.625 --> 30:04.545
I'm not sure what relationship my
learned friend has with his doctor,

30:04.561 --> 30:06.601
but mine does not take photographs
of my genitalia.

30:06.621 --> 30:10.561
The complaints Miss Blakely made
relate to events which took place a
long time ago.

30:10.577 --> 30:13.589
It is simply impossible to assess
the veracity of her account

30:13.601 --> 30:15.589
without the examination we request,

30:15.605 --> 30:18.609
something which Mr Nelson should
also welcome

30:18.625 --> 30:21.573
if he is indeed innocent of the
charges.

30:21.585 --> 30:23.601
Yes, point taken, Mr Crown.

30:23.613 --> 30:26.537
These allegations are serious.

30:26.553 --> 30:30.609
And consequently, I grant the order,
as specified in the Act.

30:37.573 --> 30:39.565
Hey. Can I sit?

30:42.581 --> 30:44.573
Does your mate want to join us?

30:44.585 --> 30:46.557
No, he likes standing.

30:46.573 --> 30:49.625
Hey, well done. They wheeled out
the big guns and you didn't flinch.

30:50.537 --> 30:52.577
Come on. Sinclair or no Sinclair,

30:52.593 --> 30:54.601
if I couldn't handle
a warrant application,

30:54.617 --> 30:57.533
we'd really be in the shit,
wouldn't we?

30:59.617 --> 31:01.573
Andy.

31:01.585 --> 31:02.621
Yes, mate?

31:03.537 --> 31:07.561
Fresh off the press -
medical officer's report on Nelson.

31:08.617 --> 31:10.565
Yeah. Um...

31:10.581 --> 31:15.541
'The left side of the penis
presents with a 28- by 13-...'

31:15.553 --> 31:18.549
'28- by 13-millimetre...

31:18.565 --> 31:22.561
..laterally oriented
capillary vascular malformation,

31:22.577 --> 31:24.581
commonly called a strawberry
birthmark.'

31:24.593 --> 31:26.533
What about the rest?

31:26.549 --> 31:28.593
What about the shape?
If I hung this next to my desk,

31:28.609 --> 31:31.565
people would think I was
planning a trip to the old country.

31:31.577 --> 31:32.613
We're on.

31:32.625 --> 31:35.545
Yeah. No, great. Thanks, mate.

31:35.557 --> 31:36.593
Yep.

31:37.593 --> 31:41.573
Hey, can we get a copy of this
sent straight over to the DPP?

31:41.589 --> 31:43.601
Mark it, 'Attention
of Owen Mitchell.'

31:43.617 --> 31:46.581
Ando. Got your mate
Alex Morino here.

31:46.593 --> 31:48.585
Moreno.

31:48.601 --> 31:51.625
Says he wants to make a statement
about Steven Blakely's murder.

31:52.537 --> 31:53.573
Alright.

31:57.577 --> 31:59.629
That night, I didn't go to Coogee.

32:01.549 --> 32:03.601
So you are retracting
your previous statement?

32:03.613 --> 32:05.549
Yeah.

32:05.565 --> 32:11.541
But if I tell you the truth,
and I can back it up,

32:11.553 --> 32:13.569
no-one needs to know, do they?

32:21.541 --> 32:22.597
Where were you, Alex?

32:25.545 --> 32:27.905
A brothel? Bullshit. At exactly the
time Blakely was killed.

32:28.533 --> 32:30.565
So he was previously too coy
to bring this up,

32:30.581 --> 32:32.625
preferred to be a suspect
in a murder investigation?

32:33.292 --> 32:34.613
The place is called Barely Legal.

32:34.629 --> 32:37.565
It specialises in Asian girls
that look under-age.

32:37.577 --> 32:39.561
Not a venue one attends with pride.

32:39.577 --> 32:41.537
His story checks out
a hundred per cent?

32:41.553 --> 32:44.553
The girl he was with remembers him,
and there's credit-card records,

32:44.569 --> 32:46.597
a secret card he uses
for special occasions.

32:46.609 --> 32:48.545
So where does this leave us?

32:48.557 --> 32:50.541
I think the expression is, buggered.

32:50.557 --> 32:52.597
His story on the rental
of Blakely's house is solid.

32:52.613 --> 32:54.605
It's rubbish.
But it's solid rubbish

32:54.621 --> 32:56.561
now that he's got an alibi
for the murder.

32:56.577 --> 32:59.557
He could have hired someone,
a co-conspirator may have done it.

32:59.573 --> 33:02.545
We have been all over this guy,
and there is no evidence of that.

33:02.561 --> 33:04.597
On the attempted murder of my family,
no evidence there either?

33:04.613 --> 33:07.561
Terry Renner is looking into the
organised-crime angle.

33:07.577 --> 33:10.609
This has nothing to do with a drug
dealer I put away five years ago!

33:10.625 --> 33:13.605
I started scratching at Moreno,
and they came straight back at me.

33:13.621 --> 33:16.617
There is not one scrap of proof,
Janet, that there is any they.

33:17.356 --> 33:19.557
It's because your people are too
incompetent to find it.

33:19.573 --> 33:23.553
Janet, none of these theories
are any use unless we have proof,

33:23.569 --> 33:25.545
and the best way to do that
is still with

33:25.561 --> 33:30.537
getting Keith Nelson committed
to trial and getting him to talk.

33:30.553 --> 33:36.549
Now, step back and allow that trial
to take its course.

33:50.545 --> 33:53.549
Miss King,
could I bend your ear for a sec?

33:53.565 --> 33:56.589
I was wondering, my brother's got a
small legal problem

33:56.601 --> 33:58.581
with a job contract at the moment.

33:58.597 --> 34:02.557
I thought, if you wanted a bit of a
break from the big stuff,

34:02.573 --> 34:04.621
and you didn't mind helping,
of course...

34:05.537 --> 34:08.621
Can't, sorry. I don't know that much
about commercial law.

34:09.536 --> 34:10.592
No problem.
Sorry.

34:10.609 --> 34:14.533
I don't get why you want to do this.
Thanks for your support.

34:14.545 --> 34:15.605
I'm saying this for your sake.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.609
I don't think
you want me to get over all this.

34:17.629 --> 34:20.605
If you want to get over it,
go to a psychiatrist, don't go to
court.

34:20.621 --> 34:23.612
Lawyers always bully you
into going to court, and then what?

34:23.625 --> 34:25.561
They're going to call you a liar,

34:25.577 --> 34:27.597
they'll pick apart every mistake
that you make,

34:27.612 --> 34:30.545
go through everything that happened,
whatever did happen.

34:30.561 --> 34:32.592
Well, it happened!
OK, you know what? It happened.

34:32.609 --> 34:35.581
You don't think it happened?
I don't know. I didn't see it!

34:35.592 --> 34:37.561
It happened! Don't touch me!

34:37.577 --> 34:39.585
Going to court isn't going to help
you get over it.

34:39.597 --> 34:41.556
Hey, are we OK here?

34:41.569 --> 34:42.605
Yeah, we're fine.

34:44.565 --> 34:45.612
Are you alright?

34:47.553 --> 34:49.609
He thinks that you're making me
do this

34:49.621 --> 34:52.561
so that you can have a big win.

34:52.572 --> 34:53.621
What do you think?

34:58.625 --> 35:00.573
Come on.

35:02.553 --> 35:04.613
Miss Blakely,
have you read your statement?

35:04.629 --> 35:07.533
I have.
Is it true and correct?

35:07.545 --> 35:08.581
Yes.

35:08.597 --> 35:11.609
I tender the statement of Miss
Blakely in evidence.

35:11.621 --> 35:14.577
No further questions, Your Honour.

35:22.609 --> 35:26.553
The statement of Miss Maya Blakely
will be Exhibit A.

35:28.625 --> 35:32.601
Miss Blakely, the events
you describe in your statement

35:32.617 --> 35:36.541
allegedly took place
between 1998 and 2001.

35:38.593 --> 35:40.541
That's right.

35:40.557 --> 35:43.541
At that time, how would you describe
the relationship

35:43.557 --> 35:46.553
between Mr Keith Nelson
and your family?

35:53.541 --> 35:55.581
He was a family friend.

35:56.581 --> 35:58.609
Your parents trusted him,
didn't they?

35:58.625 --> 36:02.601
Objection. Your Honour, Miss
Blakely's parents are deceased.

36:02.617 --> 36:05.597
She can't be expected to say what
their precise attitude

36:05.609 --> 36:07.613
towards Mr Nelson was,

36:07.629 --> 36:10.585
given she was only seven years old
at the time.

36:10.597 --> 36:12.589
I'll restate the question.

36:16.561 --> 36:20.573
Your parents regularly
relied upon Mr and Mrs Nelson

36:20.589 --> 36:24.565
to babysit yourself and
your brother, didn't they?

36:24.577 --> 36:25.625
That's right.

36:26.113 --> 36:27.593
And they wouldn't have kept doing
that

36:27.609 --> 36:29.577
if they had the slightest reason
to think

36:29.593 --> 36:33.565
that there was anything untoward
going on, would they?

36:33.577 --> 36:34.621
No, no.

36:35.537 --> 36:37.629
They wouldn't have done it
if you or your brother

36:38.545 --> 36:40.106
had ever expressed any qualms
whatsoever

36:40.537 --> 36:41.737
about the Nelsons, would they?

36:46.553 --> 36:47.601
Probably not.

36:47.617 --> 36:51.549
Yet the arrangement lasted
for three years,

36:51.565 --> 36:53.597
only ending when the Nelsons moved
interstate for a time,

36:53.609 --> 36:55.581
isn't that right?

36:55.593 --> 36:56.629
Yes.

36:57.545 --> 36:59.589
You know the reason why,
don't you?

37:01.625 --> 37:04.557
Because I never said anything.

37:04.569 --> 37:06.601
And you are now 23.

37:06.617 --> 37:11.593
Yet even as an adult,
an educated, professional woman,

37:11.609 --> 37:15.609
you never said anything,
not for 15 years,

37:15.625 --> 37:19.565
because nothing ever happened,
did it?

37:21.593 --> 37:24.589
When I was a child,
I was really scared.

37:24.601 --> 37:27.533
You were scared, of Mr Nelson?

37:27.545 --> 37:29.557
Yes.

37:29.569 --> 37:31.569
Marion Nelson, Mr Nelson's wife,

37:31.585 --> 37:35.553
also submitted a statement
regarding her recollections,

37:35.569 --> 37:39.593
and she says she thought
you were very fond of her husband.

37:39.609 --> 37:42.581
She says, in fact,
and I will quote her. She says -

37:42.597 --> 37:46.545
'I rather thought Maya
had a crush on Keith.'

37:52.545 --> 37:54.629
Is that the way
you usually show fear?

38:01.569 --> 38:07.569
I was nice to him because I thought
that I had done something wrong.

38:08.613 --> 38:12.609
And I thought that that was his way
of punishing me.

38:15.561 --> 38:16.609
OK?

38:25.549 --> 38:27.613
I'm told you did
a wonderful job in there.

38:27.629 --> 38:31.621
He was staring at me the whole
time, just like he used to.

38:32.537 --> 38:34.621
Now he's been committed to trial,
thanks to you.

38:35.537 --> 38:39.621
I think Drew might have been right,
because I feel a lot worse now.

38:40.537 --> 38:44.621
I was happy. I'd packed all this
away and I'd gotten on with my life.

38:45.537 --> 38:48.593
Everything they say that you're
supposed to do, I had done it.

38:48.605 --> 38:50.541
Had you?

38:51.565 --> 38:54.577
It will help, Maya,
when he's convicted.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.561
I can't do that again.
Yes, you can.

38:56.577 --> 38:59.549
You haven't stopped him yet.
There's still the trial.

38:59.561 --> 39:00.605
I can't do that again.

39:00.621 --> 39:03.533
Please, you can't back out now,
for your sake.

39:03.549 --> 39:06.541
I can't.
Don't let him beat you again.

39:11.545 --> 39:13.581
What else can I do?
I'm going to have to nolle it.

39:13.597 --> 39:15.569
No.
Our case is built on Maya's account.

39:15.581 --> 39:16.981
Without her, I'm dead in the water.

39:17.541 --> 39:18.605
We can't let Nelson
just walk out of remand.

39:18.617 --> 39:20.557
Let's load him up, then.

39:20.573 --> 39:22.814
I'll make a call, get a kilo of dope
found in his pocket.

39:23.533 --> 39:24.589
That should fix the prick.

39:24.605 --> 39:27.565
We think he's got
some other information,

39:27.577 --> 39:29.537
about me and the car bomb.

39:29.549 --> 39:30.613
That explains a bit.

39:30.629 --> 39:33.613
You spoke to Maya. Do you think
she's going to change her mind?

39:33.629 --> 39:36.597
No, but Nelson's been committed for
trial.

39:36.613 --> 39:38.617
We can buy some time,
police can put pressure on him.

39:38.629 --> 39:40.565
Maybe he'll give something up.

39:40.585 --> 39:43.605
How are we going to buy some time?
The case against him has fallen
down.

39:43.621 --> 39:46.545
The minute Nelson finds out...
What if he doesn't?

39:46.561 --> 39:48.201
You mean what if we don't
notify the court

39:48.541 --> 39:49.577
that Maya's withdrawn from the case?

39:49.593 --> 39:52.573
We have to, don't we? So far, we're
the only ones who know about it.

39:52.589 --> 39:55.577
As far as I'm concerned, it's just
a hiccup, witness with cold feet.

39:55.593 --> 39:57.613
Nothing to bother the court with.
Oh, God, Janet.

39:57.629 --> 40:00.609
If Maya doesn't change her mind,
fine, we'll let them know...

40:00.621 --> 40:03.585
..a few days before the trial date.

40:03.601 --> 40:07.549
You weren't here, right?
You didn't hear a thing.

40:07.561 --> 40:08.609
Going now.

40:13.617 --> 40:17.621
I'm just asking for a bit
more time - a week, maybe two.

40:20.557 --> 40:21.605
Yep, you got it.

40:30.593 --> 40:32.565
You're leaving early?

40:32.581 --> 40:34.581
I'm off to get
my fertility results.

40:34.597 --> 40:36.625
Oh. They wouldn't tell you on the
phone?

40:37.537 --> 40:38.618
They said I had to come in.

40:38.625 --> 40:40.613
What's the worst it can be?

40:40.629 --> 40:44.609
Even if I can't have kids,
I'll always have my job, hey?

40:44.621 --> 40:46.557
Has Andy done his?

40:46.573 --> 40:49.561
Mm-hm. 48 million sperm per
millilitre,

40:49.577 --> 40:53.565
with 90% classed as Grade-A, showing
highly progressive motility.

40:53.581 --> 40:55.021
I bet he's learned that off
by heart.

40:55.541 --> 40:57.181
Plans on getting a tattoo of it
next week.

40:57.537 --> 40:59.593
Listen, Tracey spoke to me today.

40:59.609 --> 41:01.625
Considering you helped me out
with Collard,

41:02.541 --> 41:04.569
she asked if I wanted to take Clarke
off you.

41:04.585 --> 41:06.549
Oh.
Is that OK?

41:06.561 --> 41:08.565
I guess someone's got to finish it.

41:08.577 --> 41:09.737
Looks like that someone's me.

41:10.533 --> 41:11.933
It's completely revolting.
I'll bet.

41:12.537 --> 41:14.561
Don't look at the photos.
You don't have to.

41:14.577 --> 41:16.597
The whole thing's pretty much
wound up anyway.

41:16.613 --> 41:19.553
Just got to wait for Mrs Moreno
to get back from overseas,

41:19.569 --> 41:21.629
get her into court
to prove that Ruby's under-age.

41:22.424 --> 41:24.585
Tracey's exact words were,
'I'm only giving you matters

41:24.597 --> 41:26.549
that will be quickly resolved,

41:26.565 --> 41:27.613
because I doubt you'll be around
long'.

41:27.629 --> 41:30.557
She's the absolute master
of genteel malice.

41:30.569 --> 41:32.609
Years of practice. I've got to go.

41:32.621 --> 41:34.617
You'll be fine. Ring me.

41:37.601 --> 41:40.577
The good news is,

41:40.593 --> 41:43.573
there's no sign of any
physiological fertility issue.

41:43.589 --> 41:46.621
Thanks. You hear about this
sort of thing dragging on for years.

41:47.212 --> 41:48.573
I can't rule that out, I'm afraid.

41:48.585 --> 41:49.621
Sorry?

41:50.541 --> 41:53.573
Given that you've been trying for
so long and the efforts you've gone
to,

41:53.589 --> 41:57.549
we would class you as
having a fertility problem.

41:57.561 --> 41:58.597
But you just said...

41:58.613 --> 42:01.573
I said we'd found
no physiological symptoms.

42:01.589 --> 42:04.609
My diagnosis for you is
idiopathic infertility.

42:04.625 --> 42:07.617
It's infertility with no obvious
physical cause.

42:10.549 --> 42:12.577
So, what can you do for that?

42:12.589 --> 42:14.605
Unfortunately, very little.

42:16.585 --> 42:20.545
Even so, I would encourage you to
keep trying.

43:15.609 --> 43:17.557
Hi.

43:19.617 --> 43:21.605
We haven't really talked, since...

43:21.617 --> 43:23.593
No.

43:23.605 --> 43:25.585
So, how's it going?

43:25.601 --> 43:28.553
I mean, Ash and the kids,
are they...

43:28.569 --> 43:31.561
As well as can be expected.
And you?

43:32.589 --> 43:35.613
I stopped watching the news.
That helped.

43:35.629 --> 43:37.629
As long as I don't google 'DPP sex
scandal',

43:38.541 --> 43:39.741
life is almost back to normal.

43:43.597 --> 43:46.601
I don't suppose you've heard
anything

43:46.617 --> 43:49.601
about when Renmark's going
to decide it?

43:51.621 --> 43:55.561
No. I've had other things
on my mind.

43:55.573 --> 43:56.609
Of course.

44:00.561 --> 44:02.581
My minder has to knock off
in an hour

44:02.597 --> 44:04.577
and I have to be safely
locked away.

44:04.589 --> 44:07.561
You bet. I should go home too.

44:07.573 --> 44:08.609
OK.

44:19.593 --> 44:21.613
Ready to roll?

44:21.629 --> 44:24.593
I can't go back to that place
tonight.

44:24.609 --> 44:27.625
Not a lot of choice, I'm afraid.
I just want to see my kids and Ash.

44:28.052 --> 44:29.613
I don't even know where
you've got them.

44:29.625 --> 44:31.561
Somewhere safe,

44:31.577 --> 44:34.533
and if you want to keep them safe,
we need to follow the rules.

44:34.549 --> 44:36.621
I haven't seen them
since it happened.

44:37.537 --> 44:40.549
Maybe I can arrange for a visit
tomorrow night after work, OK?

44:40.565 --> 44:42.597
If you feel like company,
you can have a friend over,

44:42.613 --> 44:45.533
as long as they check out with
security. Tonight.

44:45.545 --> 44:47.581
Thanks.

44:54.573 --> 44:57.573
There's only one thing worse than
being talked about,

44:57.585 --> 45:00.533
and that's not being talked about.

45:00.549 --> 45:02.629
Didn't do Oscar Wilde much good,
did it?

45:03.545 --> 45:06.569
You know, this place isn't as bad
as you said.

45:07.617 --> 45:09.609
OK, it's worse.

45:09.625 --> 45:14.549
Still, it's safe, I guess.
Hence the name, safe house.

45:14.561 --> 45:16.553
It's a prison.

45:16.569 --> 45:20.573
Every minute of the day, I have
this escort that ferries me around

45:20.585 --> 45:22.617
from here to work and back again.

45:25.597 --> 45:30.577
Ash asked me
when I thought it might end,

45:30.593 --> 45:32.613
as if there was some
obvious end point, but...

45:32.629 --> 45:36.573
There is. They'll catch the guy
who did this.

45:36.585 --> 45:38.541
Will they?

45:40.541 --> 45:41.585
What if they don't?

45:43.553 --> 45:44.605
How does it end then?

45:48.629 --> 45:51.561
I mean, we have small children.

45:52.589 --> 45:56.593
When do we decide that
it's 100 per cent safe for them?

45:56.605 --> 45:58.545
A month?

45:58.557 --> 45:59.593
A year?

46:02.569 --> 46:03.617
Ten years?

46:13.609 --> 46:17.621
When I was seven, my family
moved to Sydney from Perth.

46:19.561 --> 46:22.561
My dad gave us this lecture

46:22.577 --> 46:26.569
about how we had to treat it
as an adventure,

46:26.585 --> 46:31.625
and how he knew us kids would
make the most of the opportunities.

46:32.541 --> 46:34.625
My sister did fine,
but I don't know.

46:35.541 --> 46:38.561
I just got off on the wrong foot
at school.

46:38.573 --> 46:41.565
I didn't make any friends.

46:41.577 --> 46:43.605
Every lunchtime,

46:43.621 --> 46:46.565
I would wander around the playground
by myself.

46:51.629 --> 46:56.569
But all I could think about was
how I had let my parents down...

46:57.621 --> 47:01.581
..and wasted the opportunity
they'd given me.

47:05.625 --> 47:09.593
Loneliness and shame.

47:12.585 --> 47:15.593
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
No?

47:17.557 --> 47:20.581
I have been blessed
with this perfect family,

47:20.593 --> 47:23.577
and I put them all in danger.

47:23.589 --> 47:26.577
Janet, that's not your fault.

47:26.589 --> 47:29.545
It doesn't matter whose fault it is.

47:30.557 --> 47:33.553
They nearly died because of me.

47:33.565 --> 47:35.541
That's all that matters.

47:38.609 --> 47:40.625
You don't have to feel alone.

47:42.625 --> 47:44.573
I'm here.

47:45.629 --> 47:47.577
You're not alone.

47:52.585 --> 47:54.533
Erin.

47:56.569 --> 47:58.533
Sorry. I...

48:01.573 --> 48:03.625
I think it'd be better if you go.

48:05.589 --> 48:08.609
I'll call you a taxi, yeah?

48:11.541 --> 48:12.589
No, no, no.

48:12.601 --> 48:14.537
I'm fine.

48:15.625 --> 48:17.577
I'll see you later.

48:38.541 --> 48:39.589
Excuse me, Owen?

48:41.557 --> 48:43.605
You prosecuted
Crown against Gianopolous, 2011.

48:43.617 --> 48:45.553
Yeah, murder case.

48:45.569 --> 48:47.130
Small-time drug dealer fired
into a car,

48:47.545 --> 48:49.106
claimed he didn't know anyone
was in it.

48:49.285 --> 48:51.605
In Judge Renmark's judgement,
he cites Crown against Sharp,

48:51.621 --> 48:53.581
implies the defence relied
on the case.

48:53.597 --> 48:57.541
No. The rule in Sharp
didn't apply to the facts.

48:57.553 --> 48:58.621
No, it doesn't.

48:59.533 --> 49:00.597
Hey, Richard?

49:03.541 --> 49:06.549
I'm going for silk right now.

49:06.565 --> 49:08.617
I certainly hope
no-one's appealing the decision.

49:08.629 --> 49:11.569
No, no, it's not that.

49:11.581 --> 49:12.617
Something about Renmark?

49:13.533 --> 49:16.593
Yes, I'm just doing some research
for Janet. Thanks for your help.

49:19.545 --> 49:23.537
I can't wait to see you, Ash.
I'm leaving right now.

49:23.549 --> 49:24.585
OK, bye.

49:31.549 --> 49:33.617
Sorry, Janet,
I need to speak to you.

49:33.629 --> 49:36.561
OK. Deep breaths, deep breaths.

49:36.577 --> 49:39.553
He's clever. He chooses his
opportunities carefully,

49:39.569 --> 49:41.553
twists things
just as much as he needs to.

49:41.569 --> 49:43.565
Renmark?
Unless you're really looking,

49:43.581 --> 49:45.601
you wouldn't bat an eyelid.
That's the clever part.

49:45.617 --> 49:48.589
He's cooking his judgements?
Like a judicial souffle.

49:48.605 --> 49:51.565
Can you prove this?
It's all here, the concrete stuff -

49:51.581 --> 49:53.565
quoting obiter dicta that don't
exist,

49:53.581 --> 49:55.565
distorting facts in old cases that
no-one's read.

49:55.577 --> 49:56.613
Except you.

49:56.625 --> 49:58.597
You could put it down to sloppiness,

49:58.613 --> 50:00.581
but there's this case
Owen appeared in

50:00.601 --> 50:03.569
where Renmark has completely
misrepresented
the defence's argument.

50:03.585 --> 50:05.605
There's only one way to interpret
it,

50:05.621 --> 50:08.585
and that's as an attempt
to subvert justice.

50:12.561 --> 50:13.609
Thank you.

50:13.625 --> 50:18.549
One way or another, they're all
connected - Blakely, Nelson, Moreno.

50:18.565 --> 50:20.541
And Renmark?
Especially Renmark.

50:20.557 --> 50:22.581
Now you've got the evidence.
Yes.

50:22.597 --> 50:25.621
All those dodgy statements,
they relate to sexual assault?

50:27.601 --> 50:30.545
No, they're all sorts of things.

50:30.561 --> 50:32.577
Look, I don't claim to know exactly
what's going on,

50:32.593 --> 50:34.794
but you needed something concrete
before you could start

50:35.541 --> 50:37.601
a formal investigation,
and here it is.

50:40.541 --> 50:42.533
Thanks.

50:43.605 --> 50:45.605
Who else knows about this?

50:45.621 --> 50:48.549
Andy and one of our solicitors,
Richard Stirling.

50:48.565 --> 50:50.597
You trust him?
Absolutely.

50:50.613 --> 50:52.589
That's it, no-one else?
No-one.

50:52.601 --> 50:54.537
And the file?

50:54.553 --> 50:58.565
Two copies. This one,
and there's one back in my office.

50:58.581 --> 51:01.577
OK. I want you to go back to your
office and I want you to lock it up.

51:01.597 --> 51:04.625
I'll talk to Andy. I want you to
talk to this Stirling, tell him to
shut up.

51:05.541 --> 51:07.565
If we're going to go after
a district-court judge,

51:07.581 --> 51:10.609
no-one else can know anything,
otherwise we won't get anywhere.

51:10.621 --> 51:12.557
OK.

51:13.581 --> 51:16.549
You realise this could sink us both?

51:17.605 --> 51:22.577
I can't go much deeper. Sorry if I'm
dragging you down with me.

51:27.581 --> 51:28.629
Thanks, Jack.

51:34.553 --> 51:36.569
I need to go back to the DPP
for a moment.

51:36.585 --> 51:39.609
We're already 30 minutes late.
I'll be quick.

52:09.569 --> 52:10.617
Miss King?

52:10.629 --> 52:14.549
What dedication, working so late.

52:16.557 --> 52:17.605
And you, I presume.

52:17.621 --> 52:22.553
I was just congratulating Tony
on how cooperative everyone's been.

52:22.565 --> 52:24.617
I've finished taking evidence.

52:25.533 --> 52:27.581
Now I just have to write my
recommendation.

52:27.593 --> 52:29.597
Well, I look forward to reading it.

52:29.613 --> 52:33.601
I heard you've been reviewing
some of my judgements.

52:35.541 --> 52:36.581
Did you?

52:36.597 --> 52:39.553
I finished my career with an
impeccable reputation,

52:39.565 --> 52:41.601
and I stand by my record.

52:41.617 --> 52:44.613
I wonder if you'll be able
to say the same.

52:44.625 --> 52:46.629
Is that supposed to intimidate me?

52:47.545 --> 52:49.589
It's supposed to put you
on notice.

52:49.601 --> 52:51.537
Of what?

52:51.549 --> 52:54.569
My findings could be very damning,

52:54.585 --> 52:57.601
but I'm offering you
one last chance.

52:57.617 --> 53:03.549
Resign now
and go back to private practice,

53:03.561 --> 53:05.577
and I will tone down my report,

53:05.593 --> 53:09.617
and you might be able
to salvage something of your career.

53:13.569 --> 53:16.553
I'm not going anywhere.

53:16.569 --> 53:21.577
Then we should await the decision
of the Bar Association.

53:21.589 --> 53:23.561
Goodnight, Miss King.

53:23.573 --> 53:24.609
Pleasant dreams.

54:07.553 --> 54:08.601
Hey.

54:10.625 --> 54:12.617
On the right. Up top.

55:44.545 --> 55:47.609
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
I don't even know your first name.

55:47.621 --> 55:49.557
Robert.

55:49.569 --> 55:50.609
Friends call me Bob.

55:52.565 --> 55:53.613
Thank you, Bob.

56:13.545 --> 56:15.573
Where was it? Taped up,
underneath the desk.

56:15.589 --> 56:18.617
We found this.
Over 84,000 photos.

56:18.629 --> 56:20.561
Fucking hell.

56:20.577 --> 56:22.617
You are days away from facing a
criminal record

56:23.533 --> 56:26.549
and you have the gall to stand there
and tell me what's appropriate?

56:26.565 --> 56:29.533
Can't you make it lunchtime?
That won't be nearly so obvious.

56:29.545 --> 56:30.557
Alright, yep, 9am.

56:30.569 --> 56:31.609
No, not on the phone.

56:31.625 --> 56:35.545
Can you talk to him? You used to
work with him, please. Please!

56:36.609 --> 56:40.561
Please just give him a day or two
I know it'll work out better!

56:40.577 --> 56:43.533
I'm not running this prosecution to
find out who bombed your car!

56:43.545 --> 56:44.561
What if it was blackmail?

56:44.577 --> 56:46.573
That would mean that Owen was the one
controlling everything.

56:46.589 --> 56:49.026
Exactly.
What have we got?

56:49.027 --> 56:50.549
Not sure.

56:51.302 --> 56:52.436
Shit.
