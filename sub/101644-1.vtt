WEBVTT

00:03.462 --> 00:04.564
Look at that.

00:04.597 --> 00:06.064
Oh, no! He's running it.

00:06.098 --> 00:07.834
Oh, watch out
for the flea flicker.

00:07.867 --> 00:09.501
Run, run, run, run.

00:09.536 --> 00:11.771
You got it, Dad!

00:11.804 --> 00:16.275
Go line stands! Defense!
Come on.

00:16.308 --> 00:17.577
- Boom!
- Shit!

00:19.779 --> 00:21.280
- Nice run, nice run.
- Nice run.

00:21.313 --> 00:24.483
Alright that's it for me.
See you later, fellas.

00:24.516 --> 00:25.517
Let's go, Jackie.

00:27.352 --> 00:28.788
It's gonna be late.
Your mom's gonna kill me.

00:28.821 --> 00:30.623
Give me my watch.

00:30.657 --> 00:32.324
- Come on.
- Your watch, alright.

00:33.593 --> 00:34.459
Jesus.

00:40.365 --> 00:41.801
Why'd you let him score?

00:41.834 --> 00:43.536
I would have ripped
his head off.

00:43.570 --> 00:46.471
Oh, yeah?
Is that right, smartass?

00:46.505 --> 00:49.207
You know that's the guy
who got me in the local.

00:49.241 --> 00:51.476
I wouldn't have a job
if it wasn't for him.

00:51.510 --> 00:54.814
If you're lucky knucklehead,
he'll get you in the unions, too.

00:54.847 --> 00:57.382
I ain't ever working
construction.

00:57.416 --> 00:58.250
Well, is that right?

00:58.283 --> 01:00.352
You're too good to work
with your dad?

01:00.385 --> 01:03.188
- I never said that.
- Sure, you did.

01:03.221 --> 01:05.357
Look around.
See this neighborhood?

01:05.390 --> 01:07.560
This is as good
as it's gonna get for us, kid.

01:07.594 --> 01:10.797
Yeah, right.
I am getting out of this dump.

01:10.830 --> 01:14.299
Oh, really?
What's your plan? Enlighten me.

01:14.333 --> 01:15.167
I don't know.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.402
I'm gonna be in Point
or something.

01:17.436 --> 01:20.840
Yeah, you're gonna join
the circus?

01:20.873 --> 01:22.875
- You're gonna be a clown?
- No.

01:22.909 --> 01:26.144
You're gonna grind it out just
like the rest of us, you hear me?

01:29.549 --> 01:30.817
Put down the pumpkin, Jackie.

01:30.850 --> 01:32.184
Shoot it.

01:34.286 --> 01:35.287
Don't do it.

01:41.861 --> 01:43.730
- Great shot.
- Thanks.

01:43.763 --> 01:45.531
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

01:45.565 --> 01:47.332
Has Randy been teaching you
basketball?

01:48.233 --> 01:50.335
You know I hate
that monkey ball.

01:50.369 --> 01:52.170
I don't know.

01:52.204 --> 01:54.406
I want to be a football player
like you.

01:54.439 --> 01:56.876
Yeah, sure you do.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

01:56.909 --> 02:00.947
Listen, why don't you guys get out of here.
This isn't the brothers' court.

02:00.980 --> 02:03.916
So why don't you guys just go back
to your neighborhood, alright?

02:03.950 --> 02:05.350
Dad!

02:05.384 --> 02:08.186
Jackie, get your ass back here.

02:08.220 --> 02:09.856
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.

02:10.823 --> 02:11.691
Jackie!

02:13.392 --> 02:14.259
Jackie!

02:24.570 --> 02:28.273
...called the white Michael
Jordan and he's not even in the NBA.

02:28.306 --> 02:31.410
Instead, New Yorker Jack Ryan has
developed his skills while playing...

02:31.443 --> 02:34.346
Like, I am just amazed. He's one
of the best white players I've ever seen.

02:34.379 --> 02:36.515
He was a show-off.
He was an entertainer.

02:36.549 --> 02:38.918
If the three-point shot
were in effect,

02:38.951 --> 02:43.589
he probably would have averaged
between 35 and 40 points a game.

02:43.623 --> 02:46.358
He's the only white boy
other than Chris Mullin

02:46.391 --> 02:50.730
that has the type of respect
universally from borough to borough.

02:50.763 --> 02:52.165
Seen them all.

02:52.197 --> 02:55.333
He's one of the best shooters I've
ever seen in my life, bar none.

02:56.334 --> 03:01.607
Jackie Ryan is one of the biggest
wastes of talent in the history of basketball.

03:35.575 --> 03:37.710
Two, two, two, two.

03:44.584 --> 03:48.721
Oh, God! Motherfucker!

03:57.730 --> 04:00.499
Coach! Coach! Coach!

04:03.569 --> 04:05.337
You alright, Jackie?

04:20.753 --> 04:22.555
- Come on, Jack, flub up.
- Come on, Jackie.

04:22.588 --> 04:24.791
Come on, Jackie.
I got money on this game. Let's go.

04:24.824 --> 04:25.792
Like a fucking D.

04:28.493 --> 04:31.363
See this fuckin' dude right there?
See this fuckin' white boy?

04:31.396 --> 04:32.598
We got to get this dude
off the fucking court.

04:34.767 --> 04:36.903
Come on, man. Yeah.

04:36.936 --> 04:38.638
Yeah.

04:42.575 --> 04:44.577
- Yeah.
- Come on, man.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.045
You fucking kidding me?

04:47.046 --> 04:48.413
Are you fucking kidding me?

04:50.550 --> 04:52.685
- Hey, bro.
- Hey, my man.

04:52.718 --> 04:53.653
Let's fucking go.

04:59.692 --> 05:01.594
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:01.627 --> 05:03.029
- That's enough.
- Yo, what are you doing?

05:03.062 --> 05:04.530
No more fucking playing!

05:04.564 --> 05:07.800
Not you, not you, all you fucking
white boys get the fuck out of here.

05:07.834 --> 05:09.802
You look half white yourself,
bro.

05:09.836 --> 05:11.771
Get the fuck outta here.
You and your men, it's over.

05:13.639 --> 05:15.975
- Shut the fuck up, man. What?
- I've been playing on this court since I was 13 years old, man.

05:16.008 --> 05:17.810
Man, Yusef Hawkins was playing
at this court at 13.

05:17.844 --> 05:19.212
- See what happened to him.
- That had nothing to do with us, bro.

05:19.245 --> 05:21.113
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Why you act
like a knucklehead, bro? What's up?

05:21.147 --> 05:22.181
Get the fuck off of me.

05:22.215 --> 05:23.149
So, has he been playing
on this court since 13...

05:23.182 --> 05:24.584
I'm not on you,
you'll know when I'm on you.

05:24.617 --> 05:27.485
Yeah, you want the fucking ball?
No one's fucking playing anymore, man.

05:27.519 --> 05:28.821
Go get the fucking ball.

05:28.855 --> 05:30.623
- What the fuck, man?
- Go get the fucking ball, okay?

05:30.656 --> 05:32.024
No one's playing over here
anymore.

05:32.058 --> 05:33.391
- Fuck off this court.
- ...ass, whipping your ass.

05:33.425 --> 05:36.028
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go whip your ass over.
Get the fuck off here.

05:36.062 --> 05:40.900
Yusef Hawkins, Yusef Hawkins,
Yusef Hawkins.

05:40.933 --> 05:44.871
- That had nothing to do with us.
- Shut up. Get the fuck out of here.

05:44.904 --> 05:47.139
Take your fucking bike
and get off my court.

05:47.173 --> 05:49.809
Grab my chair, bro.
Get my fucking chair.

05:56.015 --> 05:57.283
Here you go, Marty.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.552
Good man, Farrell. Just keep them coming.
Put them on my tab.

05:59.585 --> 06:01.754
- You're good, Jackie?
- I'm good, Farrell. Thank you.

06:03.923 --> 06:05.591
Wow, what's with all
the wool today?

06:07.660 --> 06:09.996
Is that Jenny, your Jenny?

06:13.099 --> 06:15.034
Holy Christ,
she looks beautiful.

06:15.067 --> 06:16.168
She looks great.

06:17.803 --> 06:19.639
What's she doing here?

06:19.672 --> 06:22.174
I think she is visiting
her mother.

06:22.208 --> 06:24.744
- I thought she has left here from the divorce?
- No, no.

06:24.777 --> 06:27.113
- Really?
- She's back for a little bit.

06:27.146 --> 06:29.048
- Well, let's say...
- No, no.

06:29.081 --> 06:30.016
Come on.

06:35.955 --> 06:37.089
Hey, ladies.

06:37.123 --> 06:38.624
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:40.159 --> 06:43.829
Jenny Burke, the only person in high
school to average more points than me.

06:43.863 --> 06:46.666
Yeah. Well, the only reason
I scored more points than you

06:46.699 --> 06:48.534
is because my teammates
actually liked me.

06:48.567 --> 06:51.570
I mean I would have passed
the ball more if they were open.

06:53.639 --> 06:55.541
- Hi, Marty.
- Hey.

06:55.574 --> 06:57.910
I mean, look, look, I...
I've heard college does wonders,

06:57.944 --> 07:01.681
but wow, you obviously have
grown out of your awkward stage.

07:01.714 --> 07:04.550
I see you two clowns
haven't grown up at all.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.218
What are you doing back?

07:07.286 --> 07:09.188
- I'm coaching at Pace.
- That's cool.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.190
Yeah, I'm staying with my
parents for a while

07:11.223 --> 07:13.025
trying to get some money
for a place in the city.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.062
- What about you?
- I'm... - Oh, him?

07:16.095 --> 07:17.029
He ain't doing shit.

07:17.063 --> 07:20.099
I'm doing great.
Thank you very much, Marty.

07:20.132 --> 07:22.601
I'm, uh, I'm doing construction
with my old man.

07:22.635 --> 07:24.236
- Well, that's nice.
- Yeah.

07:25.738 --> 07:28.641
Um, can I buy you a drink?

07:30.843 --> 07:34.880
Uh, I don't think
that's a good idea.

07:34.914 --> 07:37.049
You know,
you might scare these girls off.

07:37.083 --> 07:39.151
They're not used
to the Brooklyn dogs like I am.

07:39.185 --> 07:42.121
What do you mean Brooklyn dogs?
We don't bite.

07:42.154 --> 07:43.990
- We'll get out of here.
- No, no. Hold on.

07:44.023 --> 07:45.925
- I want to know.
- See you around. - No, wait.

07:45.958 --> 07:47.259
It was good seeing you, Jenny.

07:47.293 --> 07:48.194
You, too.

07:51.797 --> 07:53.232
I take offense to that, Jack.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.534
I've never been a Brooklyn dog.

07:55.568 --> 07:58.137
- Farrell, I look like a Brooklyn dog to you?
- No.

07:58.170 --> 08:01.040
Thank you so much.
Man, she looks fantastic.

08:02.008 --> 08:04.643
You still got that fucking
rat tail, you little midget?

08:05.745 --> 08:08.114
Dildo. I mean, Dino.

08:08.147 --> 08:09.782
Still talking shit
outta your ass?

08:09.815 --> 08:11.017
What about you, tough guy?

08:11.050 --> 08:12.618
You still playing ball with the
grannies on Tuesday nights?

08:12.651 --> 08:17.123
I don't know, is your mother still
giving free hand jobs on Wednesday, Dino?

08:17.156 --> 08:20.092
You give him a hand job
when he gets cold at night?

08:20.126 --> 08:21.560
Oh, speaking of hand jobs,

08:21.594 --> 08:25.798
maybe I'll grab a couple of shots
and go see your little skirt Jenny?

08:25.831 --> 08:27.233
No, no Jackie. No, no.

08:27.266 --> 08:28.801
- Jackie, no.
- Come on.

08:28.834 --> 08:30.736
Who's the fucking bitch now,
bitch.

08:30.770 --> 08:32.138
Call me, alright?

08:32.171 --> 08:34.273
Mm-hmm.
I see not much has changed.

08:39.011 --> 08:42.081
Hey, Pete Vecsey.

08:42.114 --> 08:44.150
What are you doing in Brooklyn, huh?
You missed your stop?

08:44.183 --> 08:45.584
I was looking for you.

08:45.618 --> 08:47.620
Huh, my address isn't listed.

08:47.653 --> 08:51.123
Well, it wasn't hard. I mean,
you're a very popular guy Blackjack.

08:52.024 --> 08:53.325
Alright, Sherman told me.

08:53.359 --> 08:54.226
Ah.

08:55.094 --> 08:57.329
So, what's going on?
How's the writing?

08:57.363 --> 08:59.165
Slow, slow, you know.

08:59.198 --> 09:00.534
Summer pro-am games
here and there,

09:00.566 --> 09:03.769
but I did catch that game down
on West 4th Street the other day.

09:03.803 --> 09:05.204
Let me ask you something.

09:05.237 --> 09:07.873
Why are you working on your game
if you're not playing for anything?

09:08.941 --> 09:10.476
Well, reputation, I guess.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.679
What if I told you that I could get you
to try out with the New Jersey Nets?

09:13.712 --> 09:16.015
- I'd say you're full of shit.
- Why not?

09:16.048 --> 09:18.350
I mean, I see, I see you running
circles around these kids.

09:18.384 --> 09:19.785
No thanks.

09:19.819 --> 09:23.889
You know, I'm working on a piece for
Sports Illustrated on Gill Turner.

09:23.923 --> 09:27.359
He's a real big free agent now.

09:27.393 --> 09:29.128
Yeah? So am I.

09:30.062 --> 09:32.064
He says he wants to,
you know, stick around home.

09:32.098 --> 09:36.168
A lot to say about, uh,
how important basketball was in the city.

09:36.202 --> 09:38.904
- Maybe I can get a quote from you.
- Fuck that. Not happening.

09:38.938 --> 09:42.374
Jackie, you and I both know
there is no reason

09:42.408 --> 09:44.176
that you should not be playing
in the league.

09:44.210 --> 09:45.811
You know,
you come all the way down here

09:45.845 --> 09:47.847
to ask me for a quote
about Gill Turner.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.282
Go fuck yourself, Pete.
Get the fuck out of the way.

09:54.820 --> 09:57.690
<i>But the gang armed
with a gun and baseball bats</i>

09:57.723 --> 10:01.393
<i>allegedly mistook Hawkins for the boyfriend
of a white girl in the neighborhood.</i>

10:01.427 --> 10:04.130
So, what,
now all white people are bad?

10:04.163 --> 10:08.767
Yeah, I remember this. It's like they forgot
white people built the Brooklyn Bridge.

10:10.002 --> 10:13.305
Hey, jerk-off. What did I tell
you about that bike in the house?

10:13.339 --> 10:14.440
It's gonna rain. Ma!

10:14.473 --> 10:16.408
Leave it outside, please.

10:16.442 --> 10:19.445
Hey, how did today go
by the way?

10:19.478 --> 10:20.547
Don't encourage him.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.681
You know your brother worked
a double shift today.

10:22.715 --> 10:24.917
Oh, that's wonderful.
Where's your girl?

10:24.950 --> 10:26.318
With her mom.

10:26.352 --> 10:27.253
Sorry, bro.

10:27.286 --> 10:29.388
Will you pipe down?
I can't hear the TV.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.423
- Chrissy, how you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

10:31.457 --> 10:32.491
Good, good.

10:32.525 --> 10:35.227
Hey, Suzie, shouldn't you be
with your boyfriend?

10:35.261 --> 10:37.229
We're fighting,
but it's for real this time.

10:37.263 --> 10:39.398
You'd know more about
your family

10:39.431 --> 10:42.034
if you spent less time
with the brothers and the booze.

10:42.067 --> 10:44.703
- Okay, Pop. Ma, can I clean up?
- Mm-hmm.

10:44.737 --> 10:46.438
What, you got a hot date?
Look at him,

10:46.472 --> 10:50.709
28-year-old playboy living at
home with his parents, rent-free.

10:50.743 --> 10:52.111
Pa, you remember Jenny Burke.

10:52.144 --> 10:53.979
I just seen her at Faros,
you believe that?

10:54.013 --> 10:57.016
You got no
shot with Jenny Burke.

10:57.049 --> 10:57.883
Fuck you, Billy.

10:57.917 --> 11:00.186
I'm glad you saw her,
very nice girl.

11:00.219 --> 11:01.453
Right?

11:01.487 --> 11:02.888
Hmm, go take a shower,
I'll... I'll get dinner going.

11:02.922 --> 11:04.957
The bike, fucko.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.225
And there was some guy
looking for you.

11:06.258 --> 11:10.429
Yeah, it's a big-time reporter,
thinks I can play in the NBA.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.931
How do you like them apples?

11:12.898 --> 11:15.401
And I could be the starting
quarterback to the Jets.

11:19.271 --> 11:21.707
Yo, Pete! Wait up.

11:23.442 --> 11:25.344
- What? You're agreeing to that quote now?
- No.

11:25.377 --> 11:27.446
Look, they don't sound
interested, don't beg.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.181
I don't want it to sound
like I'm begging for a favor.

11:29.215 --> 11:30.816
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

11:30.849 --> 11:33.819
Hey, uh, do you want to know what Gill
Turner said when I asked him about you?

11:33.852 --> 11:36.055
No, it doesn't matter.
I'll ask him when I'm in the NBA.

11:36.088 --> 11:37.189
Thank you, Pete.

11:45.798 --> 11:48.367
- Yeah, take your lunch now, Jackie.
- I got you, Pop.

11:48.400 --> 11:52.171
Hey, Jack, did you hear about
Jackie boy here playing for the NBA?

11:52.204 --> 11:54.373
- Pipe dreams, Nick.
- Pop, you know about that.

11:54.406 --> 11:57.209
I was wondering if I could get some
shifts off, you know, so I could train?

11:57.243 --> 12:01.380
Come on, this construction site
puts food on your table, not Dr. J.

12:03.349 --> 12:05.050
Yeah,
I guess I'll catch up to you.

12:05.084 --> 12:07.152
How are you going to go? Twenty.

12:09.288 --> 12:12.258
- Marty. It's lunch, let's go.
- Okay.

12:13.459 --> 12:15.294
- What's up?
- What the fuck is the matter with you?

12:15.327 --> 12:17.396
If my dad catches you selling
that shit, you're gone.

12:17.429 --> 12:19.832
Bro, your dad's been pissed off
since Munsen died.

12:19.865 --> 12:22.067
I owe some guys some money
from an advance, no big deal.

12:22.101 --> 12:23.402
Don't say I didn't warn you.

12:23.435 --> 12:25.838
- Help me make some money.
- No fucking way.

12:25.871 --> 12:28.140
Just drop me up at the Y
on 14th after work, alright.

12:28.173 --> 12:31.043
And Marty,
use your fucking head for once.

12:31.076 --> 12:31.944
Alright.

12:33.145 --> 12:35.481
We gotta figure a way
out of this thing.

12:35.514 --> 12:37.049
We gotta make some money, Jack.

12:39.852 --> 12:41.954
- What?
- Fucking unbelievable.

12:41.987 --> 12:44.957
I'll figure something out,
but I can make...

12:44.990 --> 12:47.459
Hey, what's up jerk-off?

12:47.493 --> 12:50.530
- What's up, fellas?
- What's up?

12:50.563 --> 12:53.832
Joey tells me you ain't been
paying your fucking taxes.

12:53.866 --> 12:55.234
It's news to me.

12:55.267 --> 12:58.170
Yeah, I'll give you
some more fucking news, okay.

12:58.203 --> 12:59.606
One of our trucks got lifted.

12:59.639 --> 13:04.977
Cashmere sweaters and I heard they
ended up in your fucking pocket.

13:05.010 --> 13:07.880
If I knew anything like that,
you'd be the first to know.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.348
Scout's honor.

13:09.381 --> 13:12.017
Hey, Jackie, what are you doing
still hanging out with this jerk off?

13:12.051 --> 13:13.419
He's gonna get you fucking hurt.

13:13.452 --> 13:14.953
It's a good question.

13:14.987 --> 13:19.458
I can't wait to bust your fucking
head, you little scumbag cockeyed fuck.

13:19.491 --> 13:21.460
Little fucking ass face.

13:24.229 --> 13:25.297
Fucking ass face.

13:25.331 --> 13:27.166
You see what they look like?

13:27.199 --> 13:29.435
Fucking half-assed gangsters.

13:29.468 --> 13:31.103
Call them
football street gangsters.

13:31.136 --> 13:32.739
You know what the joke's on them

13:32.772 --> 13:36.643
because I got a whole box of cashmere
sweaters right here in this fucking trunk.

13:36.676 --> 13:37.811
You fucking idiot.

13:37.843 --> 13:40.212
- You trying to get yourself killed, Marty?
- Come on.

13:40.245 --> 13:42.081
- Fucking...
- You want to see 'em?

13:42.114 --> 13:43.550
Come on, give 'em to your family.
Check 'em out.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.484
I guess I can give one
to my mother, alright.

13:45.517 --> 13:46.452
Here, grab your shit.

13:52.358 --> 13:54.326
Fucking nice. Hey, dickheads.

13:56.696 --> 13:59.131
Don't take any action on the Mets.
They're on a hot streak.

13:59.164 --> 14:01.300
I'm not taking the Mets.
Benny took the Mets.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.001
- Where is he?
- Benny's a fucking idiot.

14:05.104 --> 14:08.507
Damn, I don't think I'll ever
marry her, so she's done.

14:08.541 --> 14:10.409
She's bluffing, Billy.
Let me talk to her.

14:10.442 --> 14:13.078
No, Jackie. Just don't.

14:13.112 --> 14:15.114
You'll make it so much worse.

14:15.147 --> 14:17.383
And my baby girl's
getting married.

14:17.416 --> 14:20.553
I don't know what lie
she told him, but it worked.

14:20.587 --> 14:22.689
Drinks are on the Ryan boys.

14:27.159 --> 14:29.228
- Barrels.
- <i>Hello. Yeah, I'm looking for a guy</i>

14:29.261 --> 14:30.129
<i>named Jackie Ryan.</i>

14:30.162 --> 14:31.964
- Hello?
- <i>Okay, can you hear me?</i>

14:31.997 --> 14:33.232
- <i>I'm looking for a guy named Jackie...</i>
- Who?

14:33.265 --> 14:35.434
- <i>Jackie Ryan.</i>
- Hold on.

14:35.467 --> 14:36.569
Jackie, it's for you.

14:40.372 --> 14:41.775
- Yeah.
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>

14:41.808 --> 14:44.009
- Who's this?
- <i>It's Peter Vecsey, you idiot.</i>

14:44.042 --> 14:46.311
<i>I finally spoke to Willis Reed,
you know, with the Nets.</i>

14:46.345 --> 14:48.013
- Okay.
- <i>I gave them your number.</i>

14:48.046 --> 14:49.816
- <i>You got a tryout.</i>
- Alright, yeah.

14:49.849 --> 14:52.585
- Yeah, sounds good.
- <i>You understand that? They're gonna call you.</i>

14:52.619 --> 14:53.485
Alright.

14:55.622 --> 14:59.626
Yo, next round is on me.
I'm going to the fucking NBA, baby.

15:02.327 --> 15:05.464
Uncle Jackie, mom said you're
taking us out to get ice cream.

15:05.497 --> 15:08.300
I am. I'm gonna get you two scoops
each, I promise, okay.

15:08.333 --> 15:11.236
I told you
that he's a liar just like dad.

15:11.270 --> 15:13.673
- Dad is not a liar.
- Yes, he is.

15:13.706 --> 15:16.475
Look, I just need you guys right now.
I'm begging you, okay.

15:16.508 --> 15:19.144
Two scoops with sprinkles.

15:20.145 --> 15:23.248
Oh, my God! Just like that.
You got that? You got that?

15:23.282 --> 15:25.317
Okay, let's go.
Come on, just like that.

15:26.485 --> 15:28.655
Right there, right there,
stay right there.

15:36.428 --> 15:38.430
Mrs. Burke. How you doing?
Uh, is Jen home?

15:38.464 --> 15:42.167
Hi, Jackie.
Look at these adorable girls.

15:42.201 --> 15:44.036
Oh, my God!
I love my nieces, you know.

15:44.069 --> 15:46.071
Well, she's at Saint Cecilia's.

15:46.104 --> 15:49.374
Hey, congratulations
on Suzie getting engaged.

15:49.408 --> 15:50.309
Thank you. We're very excited.

15:50.342 --> 15:52.444
We're gonna go.
You have a good day, okay?

15:52.478 --> 15:53.378
Let's go.

15:53.412 --> 15:54.714
We're going to church. Come on.

15:56.281 --> 15:57.650
Yo, Jenny.

15:57.684 --> 15:59.218
J... hey, ball.

16:00.219 --> 16:01.253
Jenny.

16:01.286 --> 16:02.755
Her mom said she was here, huh?

16:02.789 --> 16:06.626
- I want to go home. I am bored.
- Hey, hey, look at the magic basketball.

16:06.659 --> 16:08.661
- Ready?
- I just want my ice cream, Uncle Jackie.

16:08.695 --> 16:10.429
I know. She said she'd be here.
Jenny!

16:11.463 --> 16:12.632
Well, what's with all
the ruckus here?

16:12.665 --> 16:13.999
Jackie, what are you doing here?

16:14.032 --> 16:17.135
I come here all the time.
I teach Chrissy's kids how to shoot.

16:17.169 --> 16:19.104
No, we don't.

16:19.137 --> 16:21.139
It's a good girl.
You tell the truth all the time.

16:21.173 --> 16:22.174
Go give the father a hug.

16:22.207 --> 16:23.442
Hey, guys.

16:23.475 --> 16:25.712
- Hi, Father Brennan.
- Good to see you girls.

16:25.745 --> 16:26.746
Alright.

16:26.779 --> 16:28.815
- Who's this guy?
- Who is this?

16:28.848 --> 16:30.683
He's just an old friend
from the neighborhood.

16:30.717 --> 16:32.384
Some might say a local legend.

16:32.417 --> 16:34.654
Well, notorious is more like it.

16:34.687 --> 16:36.221
I got a tryout with the Nets.

16:36.255 --> 16:37.289
Really?

16:37.322 --> 16:38.423
- New Jersey Nets.
- Well, congratulations.

16:38.457 --> 16:40.760
- Thank you. Alright.
- Your dad will be happy.

16:40.793 --> 16:42.427
Yeah, I hope so.

16:45.430 --> 16:47.499
I'll go get the car.

16:47.534 --> 16:49.702
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

16:51.203 --> 16:52.605
I'll be right out, Travis.

16:54.339 --> 16:56.074
So, what do you say?

16:56.108 --> 16:58.143
Catch up like old times?
It's been a while.

17:00.245 --> 17:05.552
Um, you know what,
congratulations on the Nets, but um...

17:05.585 --> 17:08.153
I can't and I already got plans.

17:08.186 --> 17:09.789
- With the yuppie?
- No, no.

17:09.822 --> 17:11.423
- Come on.
- Come... he's a yuppie, Father. Come on.

17:11.456 --> 17:16.295
That is my father's lawyer and he's donating
uniforms to the parish's boys club.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.565
Did you hear her say boyfriend?

17:18.598 --> 17:21.333
I... I didn't hear it, no.

17:21.366 --> 17:22.635
Father, I got a confession.

17:22.669 --> 17:24.236
- No, do not... stop, don't do that.
- Get down, Jack.

17:24.269 --> 17:27.272
I've been waiting for this girl for six
years to come back to the neighborhood.

17:27.306 --> 17:28.808
She just got back home.

17:28.841 --> 17:32.679
She's the most beautiful thing in
Brooklyn and she won't go out with me.

17:32.712 --> 17:36.248
I'm about to be in the NBA.
I want to celebrate her.

17:36.281 --> 17:37.617
Take her out
to a nice steak dinner

17:37.650 --> 17:41.386
and I'm wondering if your, you know,
professional opinion and all...

17:41.420 --> 17:43.556
that'd be something
the good Lord would favor.

17:43.590 --> 17:48.628
Well, that I... I mean, it's up to the
young lady not the Lord, in my opinion.

17:48.661 --> 17:50.563
I mean... come on,
get down Jackie.

17:50.597 --> 17:52.799
So, you're saying she should give
me a chance like Friday night?

17:52.832 --> 17:54.701
No, no, no. Don't go putting
words in my mouth, now.

17:54.734 --> 17:56.736
Okay. Alright, fine.
Just get down.

17:56.769 --> 17:57.537
Friday night?

17:57.570 --> 18:01.874
- Yes.
- Phew! Father, thank you.

18:01.908 --> 18:03.208
Friday night.

18:03.241 --> 18:04.577
Friday night.

18:04.611 --> 18:05.745
Do not be late.

18:05.778 --> 18:07.814
I'm gonna be there
with bells on.

18:07.847 --> 18:09.448
Well, you caved in pretty quick,
didn't you?

18:09.481 --> 18:11.851
- What...
- There you go, boys.

18:14.319 --> 18:15.454
God Bless you.

18:15.487 --> 18:16.388
Bless you.

18:16.421 --> 18:18.223
Bless you, Jackie.

18:18.256 --> 18:21.460
Hey girls, uh,
give your mom and dad my love.

18:21.493 --> 18:23.395
Okay? Alright, bye.

18:23.428 --> 18:24.831
Thank you, Father.

18:24.864 --> 18:27.265
Hey, we got a date.

18:27.299 --> 18:28.768
Ice cream time.

18:28.801 --> 18:30.402
Ice cream time.

18:31.771 --> 18:33.573
Come on, Jackie.
It's easy money.

18:33.606 --> 18:34.807
I'm not doing it.

18:34.841 --> 18:37.376
I'm training, alright.
No more boozing, no more partying.

18:37.409 --> 18:38.745
I'm focused.

18:38.778 --> 18:40.947
Oh, you're banging Jenny, huh?
Good.

18:40.980 --> 18:43.415
Hey, don't talk about her
like that, alright?

18:43.448 --> 18:45.283
Oh, Mr. Sensitive.

18:45.317 --> 18:47.185
Excuse me for trying
to get ahead for once.

18:47.219 --> 18:51.724
Yeah, well, I'm trying. I just got
to pay back these guys their money.

18:51.758 --> 18:53.458
You think Gill knows
I'm trying out?

18:53.492 --> 18:54.426
Hmm.

18:54.459 --> 18:56.395
Yeah, Gill's shaking
in his boots right now.

18:57.295 --> 18:58.631
Hey, you know,
you're gonna need an agent.

18:58.665 --> 19:01.199
- I could be your agent.
- No fucking way. You're crazy.

19:01.233 --> 19:02.068
Oh, come on, man.

19:02.101 --> 19:03.670
I'll go get myself
like a nice suit.

19:03.703 --> 19:05.203
I'll do my hair up real high.

19:05.237 --> 19:07.540
I'll be like the little
miniature white Don King.

19:07.573 --> 19:09.776
Why do you owe these guys?

19:09.809 --> 19:12.277
- You're not supposed to be fucking with the Italians.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

19:12.310 --> 19:13.846
- Remember the sweaters?
- Yeah.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.983
I got a guy in the garment world who's
been cutting me in on these irregulars.

19:17.016 --> 19:19.852
Turns out they're fucking stolen,
now the Italians want their cut.

19:19.886 --> 19:22.555
- So, give it back to them.
- I can't, Jackie. I already spent it.

19:22.588 --> 19:24.322
- Of course, you did.
- Yeah, well.

19:24.356 --> 19:26.592
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey, kid. How you doing?

19:26.626 --> 19:28.193
- What's up, Billy?
- Where you been?

19:30.362 --> 19:31.664
I clocked out early, sue me.

19:31.698 --> 19:34.299
You shouldn't be operating.
I could smell the liquor from here.

19:35.768 --> 19:37.537
- What about from here?
- Fuck off.

19:37.570 --> 19:39.504
Fucking.
You fucking lay a finger...

19:39.539 --> 19:40.740
Hey, hey, hey!

19:40.773 --> 19:42.008
Hey! Hey!

19:42.041 --> 19:43.910
- Back the fuck up, motherfucker.
- Hey, hey.

19:43.943 --> 19:45.611
What the hell... Hey, hey!

19:45.645 --> 19:48.715
- Walk it off! Walk it off!
- Step back.

19:49.882 --> 19:51.283
What's going on?

19:51.316 --> 19:53.318
Eggplant here forgot
his fucking manners.

19:53.351 --> 19:55.454
- I can fucking take him...
- Fuck that.

19:55.487 --> 19:57.557
- Fuck that.
- Jackie. Jackie, Jackie, what happened?

19:58.457 --> 20:00.593
Obviously, Billy had
a little too much too early.

20:00.626 --> 20:02.929
It's no biggie. It's hot out.
You know, it could happen to any of us.

20:02.962 --> 20:05.865
- Is that a fact?
- Alright, everyone's going home. Billy, I'm driving.

20:05.898 --> 20:09.434
Will, come by the office tomorrow if
you want to file a formal complaint.

20:09.468 --> 20:11.369
I mean, come on.
What the fuck is that?

20:11.403 --> 20:12.705
- Watch your ass, Will.
- Look at him.

20:14.073 --> 20:18.611
Listen, you heard Jackie. It's hot out.
It's against the rules.

20:18.644 --> 20:20.046
You know that.

20:20.079 --> 20:21.180
It's gonna go on Billy's record.

20:21.214 --> 20:24.349
- Come on, it doesn't have to...
- Come on. Ah, come on.

20:26.853 --> 20:28.420
Happy?

20:28.453 --> 20:30.089
Fucking asshole.

20:30.123 --> 20:35.327
Way to stick up for your family, but you
don't ever throw your brother under the bus.

20:38.564 --> 20:40.465
So, you ready for the best pizza
in Brooklyn?

20:40.499 --> 20:42.668
- Best pizza in Brooklyn?
- Best. Best pizza in the fucking world.

20:42.702 --> 20:44.670
That's a bold statement.

20:46.005 --> 20:47.673
- I am starving though.
- Yeah?

20:47.707 --> 20:49.776
- You?
- Yeah, I'm starved.

20:49.809 --> 20:53.713
- This is it, huh?
- This is it. Right here. I'm gonna go see Louie.

20:53.746 --> 20:55.480
- Getting to meet Louie.
- Okay.

20:55.514 --> 20:57.717
Oh, my God! Rude.

20:59.986 --> 21:01.419
Okay.

21:01.453 --> 21:04.322
- We made it.
- We did.

21:04.356 --> 21:07.359
- Jackie boy, what's going on fella?
- Louie, how you doing, brother?

21:07.392 --> 21:08.628
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

21:08.661 --> 21:10.663
- Who's the pretty girl?
- Pretty girl's Jenny.

21:10.696 --> 21:12.698
- Hey, Jenny. Pleasure to meet you, Jenny.
- Jenny, nice to meet you.

21:12.732 --> 21:13.933
How you doing?
How's a little Joey?

21:13.966 --> 21:15.701
Little Joey's a fuck up.
What can I tell you?

21:16.702 --> 21:18.370
I mean, he's like you
when you were a kid,

21:18.403 --> 21:19.806
but now you're all grown up
and good.

21:19.839 --> 21:20.940
Thank you. Thank you.

21:20.973 --> 21:23.408
- What do you want? You want pepperoni?
- Uh, yes.

21:23.441 --> 21:25.111
- Pepperoni, please.
- Pepperoni for her and cheese for me.

21:25.144 --> 21:26.846
Can you throw in a cold one,
spot me?

21:26.879 --> 21:28.781
You spot me some Net tickets;
I'll take care of that.

21:28.815 --> 21:30.016
All season, baby.

21:30.049 --> 21:31.651
- Good seeing you.
- Good seeing you, kiddo.

21:31.684 --> 21:33.586
- Wow.
- What?

21:33.619 --> 21:34.987
Did you put out
a local press release?

21:35.021 --> 21:37.623
I got clout in this neighborhood,
you know, they take care of me.

21:37.657 --> 21:38.691
Mm-hmm.

21:39.659 --> 21:40.726
Why'd you leave?

21:40.760 --> 21:42.728
Uh, because I could.

21:42.762 --> 21:44.630
Excuse me, here you go.

21:44.664 --> 21:46.532
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.366
- Enjoy. - Thank you.
- Thanks, Louie.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.671
- Pepperoni for you.
- Um, I don't know.

21:51.704 --> 21:55.541
I, uh, I just needed to get out
of New York for a while, you know.

21:55.575 --> 21:56.776
Open my mind.

21:56.809 --> 21:58.678
Huh, you sound like a hippie.

21:58.711 --> 22:01.981
No, no. My dad would kill me.

22:02.014 --> 22:03.916
So, am I doing good so far?

22:03.950 --> 22:06.052
I mean, this place is beautiful,
right?

22:06.085 --> 22:10.089
Yeah, you know, it is by far the
cheapest date that I've ever been on.

22:10.122 --> 22:11.824
But it's not going
to be the last.

22:11.858 --> 22:12.825
I'm gonna tell you that
right now.

22:12.859 --> 22:14.894
Did any of your
basketball coaches ever tell you

22:14.927 --> 22:16.829
maybe you're just a tiny bit
too cocky?

22:16.863 --> 22:18.030
Oh, every single one of them.

22:18.064 --> 22:22.101
Yeah, and I bet your Wall
Street boyfriend can't do this.

22:22.134 --> 22:24.402
It's probably
'cause he doesn't want to.

22:24.436 --> 22:25.137
That's disgusting.

22:36.182 --> 22:37.750
I've been waiting six years
to do that.

22:37.783 --> 22:39.752
- Mm-hmm, really?
- Mm-hmm.

22:40.653 --> 22:42.588
So, how'd it stand up?

22:42.622 --> 22:43.623
Yeah, it was worth the wait.

22:44.891 --> 22:47.093
Alright, munch up. Enough of that.

22:47.126 --> 22:49.695
Let's test out
this world-famous pizza.

22:49.729 --> 22:51.097
It's the best in New York.

22:52.198 --> 22:53.933
- Mm. It's the best.
- Mm.

22:53.966 --> 22:54.867
Mm-hmm.

22:54.901 --> 22:56.602
- Told you.
- That stands up.

22:57.837 --> 22:59.105
Jenny Burke.

23:00.006 --> 23:02.208
Come on, Jackie.

23:02.241 --> 23:05.611
Let's go, bud. Hustle.

23:05.645 --> 23:07.013
Alright, come on. Pick it up.

23:07.046 --> 23:10.149
You want to play with the big
boys, you gotta hustle.

23:10.182 --> 23:11.784
Let's go.

23:11.817 --> 23:13.719
Go, Uncle Jackie.

23:13.753 --> 23:15.788
Go, Jackie.

23:15.821 --> 23:17.657
Fuck!

23:18.624 --> 23:21.160
You need to get it
under a six-minute mile.

23:21.193 --> 23:23.663
You know I do a lot better when
there's, you know, people watching.

23:23.696 --> 23:25.932
Mm-hmm.
What you need to do is focus.

23:25.965 --> 23:28.067
Uncle Jackie's too fat.

23:28.100 --> 23:29.635
I am not.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.837
- He's chicken.
- It's true.

23:31.871 --> 23:32.972
You gotta listen to them,
Jackie.

23:33.005 --> 23:35.473
Why don't you get out here
and run with me, you bum?

23:35.507 --> 23:37.109
- 'Cause I'd burn you, you Irish donkey.
- Yeah, okay.

23:37.143 --> 23:38.911
Why don't you stop yapping
and start running?

23:38.945 --> 23:41.080
- Yeah, exactly.
- Why don't you stop being so beautiful?

23:41.113 --> 23:42.214
Alright, you ready?

23:42.248 --> 23:44.216
- Okay.
- Go get 'em.

23:47.219 --> 23:49.822
Alright, pick it up, pick it up.

23:52.925 --> 23:55.728
- He's doing better.
- He is doing better.

24:02.601 --> 24:04.670
Alright, alright, I see you.

24:06.038 --> 24:07.540
He's trash.

24:12.244 --> 24:13.112
Yeah.

24:16.949 --> 24:19.719
Now, get it Jackie.

24:40.139 --> 24:41.574
Alright,
you get ten more seconds.

24:41.607 --> 24:44.243
- We're a team, baby.
- Alright, you can do it. It's all mental.

24:44.276 --> 24:45.144
Come on, dig deep.

24:45.177 --> 24:50.983
Four, three, two,
last one, last one.

24:51.017 --> 24:55.621
Oh, push, push, push, push. Come on, pick
it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up.

24:55.654 --> 24:58.858
- Come on. Come on. Pick it up.
- Ah!

24:58.891 --> 25:01.060
Push through, push through. Time.

25:01.093 --> 25:02.194
Push, push, push.

25:02.228 --> 25:04.030
Pop, pop, move your legs.

25:06.599 --> 25:07.867
Alright, alright pass it.

25:10.803 --> 25:12.605
- That's all I need to do, right there.
- There you go.

25:12.638 --> 25:14.340
No, that's not all.
You need to work on your defense.

25:14.373 --> 25:16.942
Everyone knows you can shoot,
everyone's gonna be looking for that.

25:31.023 --> 25:31.891
Thank you.

25:47.673 --> 25:48.774
Excuse me, ladies.

25:51.310 --> 25:53.012
Don't say it,
I already know, alright.

25:53.045 --> 25:54.880
Just tell me that you brought
the ID and the paper.

25:54.914 --> 25:56.015
The what?

25:56.048 --> 25:58.617
- The ID...
- I'm just kidding. Come on.

25:58.651 --> 26:00.052
You are such a pain.

26:09.895 --> 26:10.996
Hi.

26:11.030 --> 26:12.198
- Hey, how you doing? Come on in.
- Yeah.

26:12.231 --> 26:15.835
- Um...
- How can I help you guys? Take a seat.

26:15.868 --> 26:19.071
We, um, sent over an inquiry
about opening an account.

26:19.105 --> 26:21.807
Okay and, uh,
what was the last name?

26:21.841 --> 26:23.943
Uh, Ryan.
It's Jackie Ryan.

26:24.977 --> 26:27.179
Okay, Mr. Ryan.

26:27.213 --> 26:30.082
Oh, yeah. Oh, Ryan. Okay.

26:33.285 --> 26:36.655
So, Mr. Ryan, it says here
you have, uh, no banking history

26:36.689 --> 26:38.824
and you graduated high school
about 10 years ago?

26:38.858 --> 26:41.393
Yeah, I guess I never got around
to opening up a bank account.

26:41.427 --> 26:44.697
Okay. Well, in order for us
to issue you a credit card,

26:44.730 --> 26:46.165
we're gonna have to open
an account.

26:46.198 --> 26:50.035
Oh, well, he brought his ID and, uh,
a letter with proof of residency.

26:50.069 --> 26:52.304
Yeah, here you go.

26:52.338 --> 26:53.839
That's the ID.

26:55.808 --> 26:57.643
That info right there for you.

27:02.381 --> 27:03.349
Good, good.

27:04.250 --> 27:05.684
Well, that's good stuff,

27:05.718 --> 27:09.054
but, um, we're actually gonna have
to ask for a 250 minimum guarantee

27:09.088 --> 27:10.823
because lack of credit history.

27:10.856 --> 27:13.392
See, I'm about to come up
on a lot of money.

27:13.425 --> 27:15.227
You ever heard
of the New Jersey Nets?

27:15.261 --> 27:17.029
Yeah, yeah.
So did a lot of people,

27:17.062 --> 27:19.698
but, uh, I don't see how
that helps us here in the bank.

27:20.766 --> 27:22.168
How old are you?

27:22.201 --> 27:24.370
I'm old enough
to have a bank account myself.

27:24.403 --> 27:25.804
So how can I help you?

27:25.838 --> 27:28.107
Wow, look at this fucking guy.

27:28.140 --> 27:29.775
Forget it, alright, let's go.

27:30.943 --> 27:33.112
Anytime you guys want to come
back, I'm still here.

27:36.949 --> 27:38.918
Absolute waste of time.

27:38.951 --> 27:40.886
Okay, well maybe if you wore
a suit like I asked you to,

27:40.920 --> 27:42.421
he would have given you
some leeway.

27:42.454 --> 27:44.023
These things matter, okay?

27:44.056 --> 27:46.292
I'm not wearing a damn suit,
alright?

27:46.325 --> 27:47.860
And who needs a credit card,
anyways?

27:47.893 --> 27:52.298
Jesus! Because, I don't know, I figured
maybe a guy your age might want one.

27:52.331 --> 27:55.834
Oh, okay. Sorry I'm not
no fancy pants lawyer.

27:55.868 --> 27:58.237
Look, your dad doesn't like me.
He ain't never gonna like me.

27:58.270 --> 28:00.005
That is not what I meant
and you know it.

28:00.039 --> 28:02.174
Look, I'm a ball player, right.

28:02.208 --> 28:05.511
If I want money, Marty gets it for me.
It's just the way I like things.

28:05.545 --> 28:08.480
Okay, you know what, fine.
I will not bring it up again.

28:08.514 --> 28:11.217
Jesus Christ!
You are pain in the ass, you know that?

28:11.250 --> 28:13.953
Look, you just gotta understand,
I'm not gonna let you down, alright.

28:13.986 --> 28:16.755
And all of my problems are gonna
go away when I make this team.

28:16.789 --> 28:18.390
Mm. You say so.

28:18.424 --> 28:20.226
I'm gonna go work out
with Marty, alright?

28:20.259 --> 28:21.994
I'll call you after?

28:22.027 --> 28:22.895
Mm.

28:24.230 --> 28:27.032
You know you're still gonna need a suit, right?

28:27.066 --> 28:29.536
They make you travel
on one in the NBA.

28:29.569 --> 28:31.303
Now you're coming around.

28:31.337 --> 28:32.972
Now you're coming around.

28:37.876 --> 28:39.845
Those credit cards
will do you in, Jackie.

28:39.878 --> 28:41.180
That's what they're fucking
saying.

28:41.213 --> 28:43.949
Yeah, well the government
can track you and shit.

28:43.983 --> 28:47.253
Listen, I promise,
once you make it big,

28:47.286 --> 28:48.954
you don't gotta do this shit,
you understand?

28:48.988 --> 28:50.522
'Cause you're gonna make
that fucking team.

28:50.557 --> 28:51.691
Yeah,
if we don't get arrested first.

28:51.725 --> 28:54.561
- In and out, Marty, right?
- Yeah, in and out. In and out.

28:54.594 --> 28:56.495
Alright,
you watch the fucking door.

28:56.529 --> 28:58.964
I just want that cash register.

28:58.998 --> 28:59.898
Alright?

29:01.900 --> 29:03.369
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

29:33.966 --> 29:35.000
Hey, you two.

29:35.034 --> 29:36.502
- Stop right there.
- Ah, my knee.

29:36.536 --> 29:38.538
- Stop right there. Stop right there.
- Fuck!

29:38.571 --> 29:41.206
Stop right there.
Stop right there.

29:44.243 --> 29:47.279
- Get out of my house, fucko!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

29:47.313 --> 29:48.881
- What's wrong with me?
- Fuck!

29:48.914 --> 29:53.452
I get a call late last night from a
friend of mine at precinct 77 near Utica.

29:53.485 --> 29:55.254
He tells me that his son
who's a beat cop

29:55.287 --> 29:58.524
just chased your monkey ass
through Brooklyn.

29:58.558 --> 30:02.261
You know what I did for your
mother, you miserable fuck?

30:02.294 --> 30:03.663
I lied to him.

30:03.697 --> 30:07.634
Yeah, I told him Jackie was here
all night and God bless your mother,

30:07.667 --> 30:10.135
or I'd be taking your ass
to the slammer myself.

30:10.169 --> 30:12.137
- Mom...
- Well, did you do it? Is it true?

30:12.171 --> 30:15.174
No, no, no. You can't go crying
to your Ma now, you loser.

30:15.207 --> 30:16.408
You cut your shifts.

30:16.442 --> 30:18.010
You call out your brother.

30:18.043 --> 30:20.580
Then you go drinking
with your loser friend

30:20.613 --> 30:23.515
who sells drugs
at my construction site.

30:23.550 --> 30:25.184
You don't think
I know about that?

30:27.386 --> 30:29.988
Oh, he is fired, believe me.

30:30.022 --> 30:33.660
- Fuck this.
- Oh, you don't pay rent!

30:33.693 --> 30:37.963
You come and go as you please.
You got no responsibility left in you.

30:37.996 --> 30:39.465
- Fuck you, yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

30:39.498 --> 30:41.500
- Yeah, fuck you.
- Oh, yeah, fuck me...

30:41.534 --> 30:44.403
I was never fucking good enough for
you since I stopped playing football.

30:44.436 --> 30:46.305
- Oh, yeah.
- I haven't done a fucking thing right.

30:46.338 --> 30:48.641
- So, fuck you!
- Ah, ever since you got this tryout...

30:48.675 --> 30:51.176
Ever since you got this tryout,

30:51.210 --> 30:54.279
- you've been walking around like you're too good for this.
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

30:54.313 --> 30:56.115
- Fuck you.
- Hey, stop cursing in front of your mother.

30:56.148 --> 30:57.584
- Stop it.
- Fuck you!

30:57.617 --> 30:59.518
- Both of you just stop... ah!
- Get the fuck out of here!

30:59.552 --> 31:03.255
Fuck you, man. What did you do to her?
You piece of shit, fuck you.

31:03.288 --> 31:06.191
Oh, yeah. You're an embarrassment.
You're an embarrassment to me,

31:06.225 --> 31:08.927
you're an embarrassment to your
mother and this whole neighborhood.

31:08.961 --> 31:10.996
I also got a call
from Robert Burke.

31:11.029 --> 31:12.398
Don't go there.
Don't fucking go there.

31:12.431 --> 31:13.265
You're not going to ruin that
for me.

31:13.298 --> 31:14.066
- Yeah, you know what...
- Just stop it.

31:14.099 --> 31:15.134
You're not gonna fucking
ruin that.

31:15.167 --> 31:17.503
It's the one thing
I got going in my fucking life.

31:17.537 --> 31:18.605
- You're not gonna ruin it.
- Let him be now.

31:18.638 --> 31:21.306
You know what I told him?
I told him you're a bum.

31:21.340 --> 31:25.110
You're a no-good bum, so take
your shit and get out of here.

31:27.079 --> 31:29.415
- Just go, baby.
- I hope you rot in fucking hell, Pop.

31:33.620 --> 31:35.387
I'll see you there.

31:37.022 --> 31:41.160
Take your shit
and get the fuck out.

31:41.193 --> 31:43.563
And you forgot this.

31:43.596 --> 31:46.165
- I don't even fucking like you.
- Here you go.

31:46.198 --> 31:47.534
Here you go.

31:47.567 --> 31:51.270
Oh, you forget
your cowboy boots, cowboy.

31:51.303 --> 31:54.641
Here you go, those will look
nice walking the streets.

31:57.376 --> 32:01.146
Jesus fucking Christ, Pop, that
almost hit me in a fucking head.

32:02.514 --> 32:04.651
Susan, lock the door.

32:04.684 --> 32:07.152
Miss O'Brien, I love you to
death, but the show's over, okay?

32:07.186 --> 32:08.520
Go, go inside.

32:08.555 --> 32:11.658
Get out of here, fucko,
maybe the brothers will help you out now.

32:12.625 --> 32:17.196
Fuck, mother... that's it.
That's it.

32:17.229 --> 32:18.731
Alright, there you go.

32:18.765 --> 32:20.165
- Go spinning...
- You can pick those up.

32:20.199 --> 32:23.068
Go spinning your ball
and do your tricks.

32:23.101 --> 32:24.403
Fucko.

32:24.436 --> 32:27.139
I didn't know what
Marty was up to. I swear to God.

32:27.172 --> 32:30.476
Yeah, well if Marty goes to jump
off a bridge, are you gonna go too?

32:30.509 --> 32:32.478
Doc, can you take an x-ray
of my head,

32:32.511 --> 32:34.413
so my girl knows I got a brain,
please?

32:34.446 --> 32:36.482
Oh, my God!
Can you take anything seriously?

32:36.515 --> 32:39.586
Look, you are very lucky
you didn't tear anything.

32:41.286 --> 32:44.724
But that being said,
there's a lot of inflammation,

32:44.757 --> 32:46.391
you're gonna have to ice it
for a bit.

32:46.425 --> 32:49.729
I gotta play though.
I gotta tryout with the Nets.

32:49.762 --> 32:51.330
New Jersey Nets,
you heard of them?

32:51.363 --> 32:54.233
I know,
you told the receptionist.

32:54.266 --> 32:56.669
In fact, you told everyone
on the entire floor, Mr. Ryan.

32:56.703 --> 32:59.304
- Unbelievable.
- I'm excited.

32:59.338 --> 33:01.641
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

33:01.674 --> 33:02.609
Thanks, Doc.

33:05.377 --> 33:09.381
Hey, there he is.
Jackie boy, how are you, man?

33:09.414 --> 33:12.251
Alright, this is my buddy Jackie.
Jackie, this is Isabella.

33:12.284 --> 33:13.485
- Hi.
- How are you doing, Isabella?

33:13.519 --> 33:14.353
- This is Jackie. This is my girl.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

33:14.386 --> 33:15.420
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

33:15.454 --> 33:17.991
- Yeah, Isabel. Do me a favor...
- Nice to meet you.

33:18.023 --> 33:21.493
Get me, uh, two packs of Parliament and
get me some... get me some quarters.

33:21.528 --> 33:23.395
- I'll see you at the party later.
- Laundry day. Thank you.

33:23.428 --> 33:24.797
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

33:24.831 --> 33:28.568
Alrighty,
it's my Dominican girl, okay?

33:28.601 --> 33:30.670
She's gonna bring a couple
of hot models around here.

33:30.703 --> 33:32.471
We're gonna have a nice
little party here.

33:32.504 --> 33:34.473
- Hey!
- Yes.

33:34.506 --> 33:37.075
- You know I can hear you, right?
- Uh-huh.

33:37.109 --> 33:40.212
Jesus Christ, Marty. You got to
clean this place up. It's disgusting.

33:40.245 --> 33:42.314
And can you get rid of the booze
'cause there's no more booze for him

33:42.347 --> 33:43.983
and, you know what,
no more booze for you either.

33:44.017 --> 33:46.619
What are you talking about? I'm not the
one that's in training hopping the ball.

33:46.653 --> 33:49.556
Yeah, well, you're a bad influence
and if you're gonna be his agent,

33:49.589 --> 33:51.490
- you need to get your shit together.
- She's got a point there.

33:51.523 --> 33:53.860
You know, there's fat agents out there.
I've seen them.

33:56.896 --> 33:58.330
Alright.

33:58.363 --> 33:59.732
- You like the place?
- I love it.

33:59.766 --> 34:02.100
- Okay, those two top drawers are yours...
- Uh, I'm gonna go, okay?

34:02.134 --> 34:03.736
- But I'll see you tonight.
- Alright.

34:03.770 --> 34:06.438
- Thank you for everything.
- Bye, Jenny. Where's my kiss?

34:06.471 --> 34:07.540
Awesome.

34:08.841 --> 34:11.243
She's looking good.
Uh, those two top drawers are yours.

34:11.276 --> 34:13.713
Just do me a favor,
stay away from this shit, okay?

34:13.746 --> 34:15.782
'Cause people got dibs on that.

34:15.815 --> 34:19.418
And that's your bed. Good, you're gonna
fit perfect. Watch it. Alright, listen.

34:19.451 --> 34:25.490
- What?
- Here's what we owe, alright?

34:25.524 --> 34:26.626
Jesus!

34:26.659 --> 34:28.528
That's for you from your agent.

34:46.913 --> 34:49.849
Yo, I shouldn't be mad that Jenny
wants to go to law school, right?

34:49.882 --> 34:52.184
The most important thing is
she loves her job, right?

34:52.217 --> 34:53.318
Absolutely.

34:53.352 --> 34:56.221
And this freaking Travis guy
or whatever his name is,

34:56.254 --> 34:58.691
he's just a family friend,
you know?

34:58.725 --> 34:59.892
He's just trying
to help her out.

34:59.926 --> 35:02.795
Yeah. You know what they say
about family friends, right?

35:06.566 --> 35:08.200
Yo, you think her mother's
ever gonna like me?

35:08.901 --> 35:10.402
Nah, it ain't happening.

35:13.372 --> 35:14.774
- I haven't missed yet.
- Nice.

35:14.807 --> 35:15.742
I know.

35:18.343 --> 35:20.212
- That's your boy, Gill Turner.
- Yeah.

35:21.714 --> 35:23.348
He's in better shape
than you are.

35:23.382 --> 35:24.316
Yeah, I noticed.

35:24.349 --> 35:25.785
You gonna say something to him?

35:25.818 --> 35:27.252
Of course,
I'm gonna say something to him.

35:27.285 --> 35:30.188
Hey yo, Gill. What up?

35:30.222 --> 35:31.557
Yeah, I know you, right?

35:31.591 --> 35:33.593
Yes, it's Blackjack
from John Jay.

35:33.626 --> 35:36.294
Oh, Blackjack from John Jay.

35:36.328 --> 35:37.630
Long time, man. How you doing?

35:37.664 --> 35:39.132
I'm doing good.

35:39.164 --> 35:41.868
You know, killing it at The Cage,
leading scorer two summers in a row.

35:41.901 --> 35:44.503
Oh, I didn't know
they keep statistics.

35:44.537 --> 35:45.605
Hell yeah, they do.

35:45.638 --> 35:47.472
Yo, you should come down
some time, it's a good run.

35:47.506 --> 35:49.508
I'll think about it.

35:49.542 --> 35:53.680
Yo, Gill. No offense, but uh, I wanted
to tell you I was a little surprised

35:53.713 --> 35:55.748
you only averaged six assists
a game last season.

35:55.782 --> 35:58.517
Scorekeeper had it out for me.
Cost me two of my games at least.

35:58.551 --> 36:00.553
See, I told you
they do that shit.

36:00.586 --> 36:01.888
Yeah, I've been watching you
since your rookie years,

36:01.921 --> 36:05.290
still getting away with that stutter
step, huh? That hesitation?

36:05.323 --> 36:06.291
Seems to be working.

36:06.324 --> 36:07.727
Not if I was guarding you.

36:07.760 --> 36:10.663
- Yo, listen. I'm gonna get back to my workout.
- Yo, yo, Gill.

36:10.697 --> 36:13.498
Yo, I said that stuff 'cause
I respect your game, you know.

36:13.533 --> 36:15.068
We used to go hard
at each other back in the day.

36:15.101 --> 36:19.872
But that was a long time ago and a lot
has changed, if you know what I mean.

36:19.906 --> 36:23.843
Yeah, but, look,
I got a tryout with your Nets,

36:23.876 --> 36:25.578
Fitch wants to take a look.

36:25.611 --> 36:27.580
I'm wondering
if you can put in a word.

36:27.613 --> 36:29.649
Look, what motor mouth here
is saying is you're a local guy.

36:29.682 --> 36:31.551
You know how it is.
Put in a good word for him.

36:31.584 --> 36:34.419
Sure, yeah, yeah.
I'll see what I could do.

36:35.722 --> 36:37.355
We could always use a backup.

36:38.658 --> 36:40.492
This motherfucker said it.
Alright.

36:42.294 --> 36:42.962
Let's go.

36:45.464 --> 36:46.866
Jackie, don't let him
get in your head.

36:46.899 --> 36:50.335
Yeah, well, I'm not in his head.
See the way he fucking looked at me?

36:50.368 --> 36:53.405
Fuck him. You know,
you're the star and by the way,

36:53.438 --> 36:54.907
I got a pair of sneakers in there for you.
They're brand-new.

36:54.941 --> 36:55.975
Check them out.

37:04.650 --> 37:06.351
You mind taking me
to Jen's after this?

37:06.384 --> 37:08.453
Are you kidding? We got plans.

37:09.655 --> 37:10.857
What do you think
of the sneakers?

37:10.890 --> 37:12.324
Any good?

37:12.357 --> 37:14.894
- Yeah, you fucking good?
- What are you doing?

37:14.927 --> 37:16.996
What do you mean what am I doing?
What are you doing?

37:17.029 --> 37:18.531
Hey, look. Let's go out
and have a little fun.

37:18.564 --> 37:21.466
You've been training like a fucking animal.
Let's go blow off some steam.

37:21.500 --> 37:22.769
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:22.802 --> 37:24.402
Do a little blow?
Ride that white lightning? What the fuck?

37:24.436 --> 37:25.671
This is for the Dominican girl.

37:25.705 --> 37:26.739
It's not a good look, Marty.

37:26.773 --> 37:28.674
Jack, you don't break
my fucking balls, alright?

37:30.442 --> 37:32.812
- Like the sneakers or what?
- I like...

37:32.845 --> 37:34.080
Alright, good.

37:34.113 --> 37:36.983
You know what fuck it. Alright?
I've been working my ass off.

37:37.016 --> 37:38.450
- Yeah.
- Let's go out tonight.

37:38.483 --> 37:39.585
- Yeah.
- Huh?

37:39.619 --> 37:41.754
- Absolutely.
- see what we can get into.

37:41.788 --> 37:44.891
Let's have a good time. Let's go.
I'm gonna hit the showers.

37:44.924 --> 37:46.025
Alright, go ahead.

37:56.068 --> 37:57.870
- Some what?
- Some art on the walls.

37:57.904 --> 38:00.740
- I like these walls. Fucking...
- No.

38:00.773 --> 38:02.542
- Get off...
- Give me a kiss.

38:02.575 --> 38:04.911
- Where's my cigarettes?
- Yeah, you...

38:11.383 --> 38:14.554
Baby, I'm thirsty.
Can you make me a drink?

38:14.587 --> 38:16.122
- What does she want?
- Some sort of drink.

38:16.155 --> 38:17.355
Dude, you know where they are.

38:17.389 --> 38:18.057
The other one.

38:19.091 --> 38:21.794
- Grab her somethin'. What's your name?
- Liz.

38:21.828 --> 38:24.831
Liz, Liz.
Where you from, Liz?

38:24.864 --> 38:26.732
- Bronx.
- Everyone...

38:34.607 --> 38:36.441
You can get
the best pizza in Bronx.

38:37.877 --> 38:41.413
- Yo, baby.
- I think I need like... it's just a siesta time.

38:41.446 --> 38:42.715
Yeah, I think so too.

38:42.748 --> 38:44.784
- This is like...
- Take a bigger, bigger sip.

38:44.817 --> 38:47.987
One more big sip
and we'll go to bed in a bit.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.055
There you go.

38:54.426 --> 38:55.094
Hmm.

38:57.462 --> 38:58.865
I'm so happy right now.

39:56.255 --> 39:57.757
Excuse me.

39:57.790 --> 39:59.725
Come on, Jack. Let's go.

39:59.759 --> 40:01.227
What do you want to do?

40:01.260 --> 40:04.096
- What do you want to do?
- We got to get it. We got to get into the water.

40:04.130 --> 40:06.065
Yeah, we got to get
into the fucking blue.

40:06.098 --> 40:08.466
Get in. Go, go.

40:11.037 --> 40:13.471
Oh, yeah baby.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

40:13.505 --> 40:15.174
First time's a charm.

40:16.575 --> 40:18.044
- Let's get boosters.
- Let's go.

40:19.979 --> 40:23.816
- Hey.
- You should wear the hat.

40:23.849 --> 40:25.251
Heehaw, motherfucker.

40:25.284 --> 40:26.152
Let's go.

40:27.253 --> 40:29.588
Marty.

40:29.622 --> 40:30.790
Alright, where are we headed?

40:30.823 --> 40:32.892
Fucking car
smells like a turtle.

40:32.925 --> 40:35.061
What was her name?
What was her name?

40:36.162 --> 40:37.630
Oh, fuck!

40:37.663 --> 40:39.832
- Motherfucker.
- Mother...

40:39.865 --> 40:41.634
- No, it's not. It's not.
- It's not?

40:41.667 --> 40:42.835
- No, it's not.
- Are you sure?

40:42.868 --> 40:45.237
Where you going?
What? Where you going?

40:45.271 --> 40:47.139
You wanted me to go
by Jenny's house, right?

40:47.173 --> 40:48.774
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:49.675 --> 40:51.577
Which one is her house?

40:51.610 --> 40:54.246
Slow down. Right here.
Right here. Right here. Right here.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.513
Slow down.

40:56.248 --> 40:57.515
- Move.
- Hey, Jenny.

40:57.550 --> 41:00.553
Go, go, go, go, go.
Get the fucking light. Go, Marty.

41:00.586 --> 41:02.088
Fuck, go.

41:02.121 --> 41:05.624
Old big Jackie Ryan,
you're scared chicken shit.

41:08.761 --> 41:10.629
I knew you wasn't
going to do it.

41:24.610 --> 41:28.547
<i>In sports, free agent
Gill Turner is in talks to re-sign</i>

41:28.581 --> 41:30.616
- <i>with the New Jersey Nets.</i>
- Turn that fucking shit off, man.

41:30.649 --> 41:33.019
- Not gonna hear it.
- No, keep it on. I'm listening to it.

41:33.052 --> 41:36.055
<i>...with the NBA Championships
throughout the next few seasons.</i>

41:36.088 --> 41:39.859
<i>His agent on Friday confirmed the
agreement which was first reported by...</i>

41:39.892 --> 41:41.127
Don't I have something
to do today?

41:41.160 --> 41:42.228
Yeah, dumbass.

41:43.195 --> 41:44.296
You got your sister's
wedding today.

41:46.732 --> 41:49.068
Oh, my fucking God, bro!

41:50.603 --> 41:53.272
Oh, my fucking... My mother's
gonna kill me. What time is it?

41:54.940 --> 41:56.142
Seven o'clock.

41:56.175 --> 41:59.779
Jenny's never gonna fucking
talk to me again. We gotta go.

41:59.812 --> 42:02.214
- Now?
- Gotta go. I gotta change.

42:10.990 --> 42:13.125
Oh, man, it's not starting.

42:13.159 --> 42:14.593
What do you mean
it's not starting?

42:14.627 --> 42:16.729
I'm going to tell you, if it's not
starting, then the battery's dead.

42:18.064 --> 42:20.699
What do you fucking mean the
battery's dead? Marty, let's go.

42:20.733 --> 42:23.202
Jackie, I'm telling you, we must
have had the radio running all night,

42:23.235 --> 42:24.870
or had a light on or some shit.

42:24.904 --> 42:27.239
Oh, my God! Oh, I gotta change.

42:27.273 --> 42:29.108
Come on, let's walk.

42:29.141 --> 42:31.043
- We got to go.
- Alright.

42:35.247 --> 42:36.682
I'm getting a bit old.

42:39.952 --> 42:43.722
Oh, you got my lighter?

42:43.756 --> 42:45.057
Where the fuck are we?

42:47.726 --> 42:49.728
You got my lighter?
Oh, I got it here.

42:50.963 --> 42:52.098
Come on, let's go this way.

42:55.034 --> 42:56.335
Holy shit!

42:58.003 --> 42:59.772
What are you wearing
to this thing?

42:59.805 --> 43:01.107
- Huh?
- What are you wearing?

43:01.140 --> 43:02.174
- What am I wearing?
- Yeah.

43:02.208 --> 43:03.342
Not fucking this.

43:06.245 --> 43:08.047
- Right here, right here, right here.
- Pull up.

43:08.080 --> 43:09.949
Holy shit!

43:15.020 --> 43:17.123
- Pay him.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

43:17.156 --> 43:19.225
You don't want to get
fucking paid, bro?

43:21.727 --> 43:23.362
- Here you go.
- Who the fuck put cans on the floor?

43:23.395 --> 43:25.131
This fucking guy
doesn't want to get paid.

43:26.365 --> 43:27.900
Ah, fuck!

43:27.933 --> 43:33.772
Suzanne Ryan, do you take Dave Roylance
to be your lawful wedded husband,

43:33.806 --> 43:37.910
to have and to hold from this day forward...

43:37.943 --> 43:42.815
...for better or worse, for richer
or poorer, in sickness and in health,

43:42.848 --> 43:47.319
to love and to cherish
till death do you part?

43:47.353 --> 43:48.287
I do.

43:49.455 --> 43:54.126
I take this ring as a sign
of my love and faithfulness

43:54.160 --> 43:57.396
s in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

43:59.965 --> 44:05.838
Dave Roylance, do you take
this woman Suzanne Ryan

44:05.871 --> 44:08.240
to be your lawful wedded wife,

44:08.274 --> 44:10.476
to have and to hold
from this day forward,

44:10.509 --> 44:13.412
for better, for worse,
sickness and in health, rich or poorer,

44:13.445 --> 44:18.384
to love and to cherish,
till death do you part?

44:18.417 --> 44:19.818
I do.

44:20.953 --> 44:26.458
I take this ring as a sign
my love and faithfulness,

44:26.492 --> 44:28.427
in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

44:29.328 --> 44:31.163
Put your hands on the Bible.

44:36.202 --> 44:40.739
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

44:46.345 --> 44:49.048
Kiss the bride now.

44:57.489 --> 44:58.357
Thank you, Father.

45:01.193 --> 45:03.896
I can't see.
I have no idea.

45:08.834 --> 45:12.004
Oh, yes.

45:12.037 --> 45:13.305
Take your glasses off.

45:14.907 --> 45:17.142
I do not want to talk to you
about this right now.

45:17.176 --> 45:20.112
Well, Gill didn't even know who the
hell I was, you believe that shit?

45:21.581 --> 45:22.414
What do you want me to say?

45:22.448 --> 45:25.184
Nothing.
That is what I want you to say.

45:25.217 --> 45:27.386
God, I can't even look at you
right now.

45:27.419 --> 45:29.121
I mean,
first you don't call me back

45:29.154 --> 45:31.558
and then you show at my house,
drunk.

45:31.591 --> 45:34.193
I wasn't drunk, yet.

45:34.226 --> 45:37.830
You know all that training,
it's the nice Jackie Ryan.

45:37.863 --> 45:40.266
- That's where you're on.
- You're starting to sound like my father.

45:42.034 --> 45:47.106
If you do anything to ruin your baby sister's
wedding, I'll break your Irish kneecaps.

45:48.173 --> 45:51.510
Not cool Jackie, not cool.

45:53.879 --> 45:57.149
Jackie Ryan, I have never
been more upset with you.

45:57.182 --> 45:59.051
Ma. Ma.

45:59.084 --> 46:00.352
This is your sister's wedding.

46:01.320 --> 46:02.187
Look at you.

46:03.289 --> 46:06.258
Pull yourself together, now.

46:10.929 --> 46:14.534
I thought this was a
celebration, for crying out loud.

46:14.567 --> 46:17.236
I don't know, but your mom
is sure hot when she's angry.

46:17.269 --> 46:18.304
Oh!

46:18.337 --> 46:21.173
Jackie, Jackie. No, no, no, no.

46:50.202 --> 46:52.905
- Oh so... the day...
- Marty!

46:52.938 --> 46:54.641
- Oh, fuck me.
- Marty!

46:54.674 --> 46:56.475
- Hey, baby.
- You son of a bitch!

46:56.508 --> 46:58.877
- What?
- Where's my credit card?

46:58.911 --> 47:00.279
- What do you mean your credit card?
- You took my car.

47:00.312 --> 47:01.513
How am I supposed
to get to work?

47:01.548 --> 47:03.650
I didn't... I didn't... stop...
Will you hold on for a second?

47:03.683 --> 47:06.185
- I'm getting your car detailed, sweetie.
- That's bullshit.

47:06.218 --> 47:08.588
- You're such a liar.
- Oh, no, no. I'm giving you details.

47:08.621 --> 47:10.189
- You're always lying.
- It's gonna look beautiful.

47:10.222 --> 47:12.224
- It's gonna...
- Get it for me right now.

47:12.257 --> 47:13.492
I'm gonna get it.
You don't even mean that.

47:13.525 --> 47:15.662
- Marty, hurry the fuck up, please.
- Give me a kiss.

47:15.695 --> 47:17.062
- My credit card.
- I know. I know.

47:17.096 --> 47:18.665
Listen, I got your car
nice and detailed.

47:18.698 --> 47:19.532
- You needed a new battery. - Marty, I need you.
- That better not be a lie.

47:19.566 --> 47:20.667
- You needed a new battery.
- Go get it.

47:20.700 --> 47:23.570
- You didn't tell me how fly I look.
- You look drunk.

47:23.603 --> 47:26.238
- I'm not drunk. Give me a kiss.
- No. Get out. Go get it.

47:26.271 --> 47:27.540
- Alright, I'm getting it.
- Go. I'm waiting.

47:27.574 --> 47:28.575
- You waiting?
- I'm waiting. I'm waiting.

47:28.608 --> 47:30.543
Oh, fuck me.

47:30.577 --> 47:31.678
Fucking Dominican girls are f...

47:31.711 --> 47:34.046
Hey, you forget about
the fucking money you owe me?

47:34.079 --> 47:35.147
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Did you forget...

47:35.180 --> 47:36.915
Marty, for God's sakes,
give him the fucking money.

47:36.949 --> 47:38.517
I got your money.
I said, I got your money.

47:38.551 --> 47:40.085
- Alright, Eddie. It's coming.
- I want my money.

47:40.119 --> 47:42.187
Please don't hit me. No more. Alright,
it's right down here. Can I get it?

47:42.221 --> 47:43.623
- Give me a second.
- I fucking don't like you.

47:43.656 --> 47:46.358
Okay, alright, alright. Eddie.
One second. Here you go. Here you go.

47:46.392 --> 47:48.695
Alright? Okay, good.
Okay, buddy is it good now? No, don't.

47:48.728 --> 47:51.564
Give me
motherfucking money interest.

47:51.598 --> 47:52.931
- I'm not a jerk-off.
- Alright, Eddie.

47:52.965 --> 47:54.433
- Alright.
- You called me a fucking football?

47:54.466 --> 47:55.735
I didn't call you anything.

47:55.769 --> 47:56.736
- Just give me a fucking second, Eddie.
- You little cocksucker.

47:56.770 --> 47:58.103
Just give me a second.
There's your interest.

47:58.137 --> 48:00.973
- There's your fucking interest. Please.
- I don't fucking like you.

48:01.006 --> 48:02.508
No, no, no.

48:02.542 --> 48:04.577
- No, buddy. Help me.
- Dirty little fucking...

48:04.611 --> 48:06.445
- You fucking rat, don't move.
- No.

48:06.478 --> 48:10.249
Hey, Eddie. Don't, please don't.
Don't do this, Eddie.

48:10.282 --> 48:14.319
Dude, don't. Eddie, don't...
Fuck it, hit me in my nose.

48:14.353 --> 48:16.955
Come on, Eddie.
Please don't, Eddie.

48:19.291 --> 48:20.993
Eddie, please.

48:21.026 --> 48:22.995
Hey, Jackie. You think you're
gonna make this team or what?

48:25.130 --> 48:26.666
I don't know.

48:29.168 --> 48:32.137
I told you not to hang out
with that fucking thief bum.

48:35.073 --> 48:36.942
Fuck me, man.

48:37.777 --> 48:38.711
Ah.

49:09.576 --> 49:11.443
Okay, uh, I think that's enough.

49:13.580 --> 49:15.047
Jackie, come on.

49:15.080 --> 49:16.348
No, Jackie.

49:16.381 --> 49:18.116
Come on, let's save some of that
for the fourth quarter, huh?

49:19.051 --> 49:22.020
Can you please do
some of your basketball tricks?

49:22.054 --> 49:24.256
Can I do some
of my basketball tricks?

49:24.289 --> 49:26.024
Of course.
What do you want to see?

49:26.058 --> 49:27.059
Spin it?

49:30.630 --> 49:32.599
- Oh, well.
- Well, I'll make you another one.

49:34.500 --> 49:38.337
Listen, I'm... I'm trying to be real
classy here with the tie and coat,

49:38.370 --> 49:39.739
so I'll keep it short,

49:39.772 --> 49:44.677
but I just want to say a few words
about my... my beautiful family.

49:44.711 --> 49:46.613
Well, as long as you're paying
for dinner, huh, Pop?

49:46.646 --> 49:49.782
Actually, it's on me.
So, don't remind me.

49:49.816 --> 49:52.150
Good time.

49:52.184 --> 49:54.253
But I want to share this
one story.

49:54.286 --> 49:57.322
You know, Susan, she...
she made lunches for the kids every day

49:57.356 --> 49:59.191
and everyone was picky.

49:59.224 --> 50:01.159
I mean Billy wanted baloney.

50:01.193 --> 50:03.596
Suzie and Chrissy,
they wanted their PB&J's

50:03.630 --> 50:05.832
and Jackie just loved
his fried chicken.

50:10.502 --> 50:15.507
But my sweet Susan,
she didn't complain once, not once.

50:15.542 --> 50:20.212
She never complained about those
late hours or raising the kids.

50:20.245 --> 50:25.785
You are the most generous,
grateful, kind person I know.

50:25.818 --> 50:27.687
I love you with all my heart,
pearl.

50:27.720 --> 50:30.088
I love you, too.

50:31.658 --> 50:33.325
I tell you my mom's drunk.

50:33.358 --> 50:34.694
But it didn't stop there.

50:34.727 --> 50:37.764
As soon as Suzie and Chrissy
were old enough,

50:37.797 --> 50:39.032
they started helping out.

50:39.064 --> 50:43.836
When it was time for Billy to...
to come alongside his old man

50:43.870 --> 50:46.806
and work right next to me,
he didn't bat an eye.

50:49.609 --> 50:50.710
I'm a very lucky man.

50:51.711 --> 50:54.313
So, here's to my...
my wife and kids.

51:01.286 --> 51:03.322
I'm gonna go congratulate him.

51:03.355 --> 51:04.624
- I'll be right back.
- I think you can have some water.

51:04.657 --> 51:07.125
Pop, congratulations.

51:07.159 --> 51:09.494
- Sit down, Jackie.
- No, no. I'm so proud of you and mom.

51:09.529 --> 51:11.564
I just feel bad for her,
you know.

51:11.598 --> 51:14.132
She's got to spend every day
with his miserable ass now, huh?

51:14.166 --> 51:15.334
Jackie, come on.
Let's go, buddy.

51:15.367 --> 51:16.636
- Get the fuck off me.
- Jackie, don't.

51:16.669 --> 51:18.738
You didn't waste one opportunity
to take a shot at me, huh?

51:18.771 --> 51:20.006
Not one.

51:20.039 --> 51:21.406
- You piece of shit.
- Come on, Jackie. Let's go.

51:21.440 --> 51:23.375
Get the fuck off of me.

51:23.408 --> 51:25.578
Floor seats. Floor seats.

51:25.612 --> 51:26.546
- That's what I'm going to give you one day.
- Come on. Come on.

51:26.579 --> 51:29.514
- Keep dreaming.
- Let's go. Come on.

51:31.216 --> 51:33.352
Look, he just hasn't been
drinking in a while, okay?

51:33.385 --> 51:35.354
He's just dehydrated, okay?
It's okay.

51:54.373 --> 51:55.407
Pizza's here.

51:55.440 --> 51:56.341
Pizza!

52:00.813 --> 52:02.214
Wait, you're not the delivery.

52:02.247 --> 52:03.950
Do I look like
a delivery person?

52:03.983 --> 52:07.185
Well, Jackie made it to the NFL,
so you have to wear these beads.

52:07.219 --> 52:09.254
You touch me with those beads, I will
break your fucking wrist. Do you hear me?

52:09.287 --> 52:11.557
Jenny. Baby.

52:11.591 --> 52:13.492
Baby?
Now you want to call me baby?

52:13.525 --> 52:14.493
Did you call me baby
five minutes ago?

52:14.526 --> 52:16.796
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- What?

52:16.829 --> 52:18.931
You're such a piece of shit,
you know that? I'm done.

52:24.604 --> 52:28.675
Jenny, wait.
Just wait, just wait.

52:28.708 --> 52:29.909
Let me talk to you
for one second.

52:29.942 --> 52:31.911
Jeez, please, please, please,
please, please.

52:31.944 --> 52:34.246
- Jackie, I don't want to talk to you right now.
- I'm fucking sorry.

52:34.279 --> 52:37.282
I know you're sorry, but you know what,
I'm so fucking pissed at you right now,

52:37.315 --> 52:38.450
but let me give you
a piece of advice.

52:38.483 --> 52:40.753
Tell these people to leave
and go to sleep.

52:40.787 --> 52:42.220
I can't tell them
to fucking leave.

52:42.254 --> 52:43.388
I don't even know
who the fuck they are.

52:43.422 --> 52:44.791
- People...
- Why can't you fucking tell them to leave?

52:44.824 --> 52:45.992
Of course,
you can't tell them to leave

52:46.025 --> 52:47.292
because you're the fucking life
of the party, aren't you?

52:47.325 --> 52:48.360
And that fucking girl was
grinding on me all fucking night.

52:48.393 --> 52:50.697
- I don't even know her fucking name.
- Oh, my God!

52:50.730 --> 52:51.396
- The girl.
- Don't even get me started with the girls.

52:51.430 --> 52:52.865
It's so fucking disrespectful.

52:52.899 --> 52:55.001
I sacrificed so much to help you out
and you're throwing it all away...

52:55.034 --> 52:56.301
I'm a fucking idiot.
I'm a fucking idiot.

52:56.334 --> 52:58.370
Why do you always
fucking do this?

52:58.403 --> 53:01.541
I'm a fuck up. Again, I'm sorry.
I love you. Please. Please.

53:01.574 --> 53:03.910
That's all I ever hear.
Is you're so sorry. You're so sorry.

53:03.943 --> 53:04.811
You know what?

53:05.778 --> 53:07.512
I wish you the best
of luck tomorrow, okay.

53:15.855 --> 53:16.723
Jenny.

53:20.760 --> 53:22.929
I'm sorry. Jenny, please.

53:33.573 --> 53:36.843
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, sorry.
Fuck.

53:36.876 --> 53:38.578
Fucking idiot.

53:51.591 --> 53:54.761
Marty. Marty, I got to go.
I got the fucking tryout.

53:54.794 --> 53:55.828
Get the fuck up.

53:55.862 --> 53:57.096
We're late.

53:57.130 --> 53:58.698
- Give me like 15 minutes.
- Marty, get the fuck up.

53:58.731 --> 54:00.967
Stop, Jackie,
my face is killing me.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.636
- We gotta go.
- Oh, fuck!

54:04.537 --> 54:05.772
Just give me like 15 minutes.

54:05.805 --> 54:09.474
Marty, get the fuck up.
We have to go. I'm late.

54:09.508 --> 54:11.010
Biggest day of my fucking life.

54:11.043 --> 54:13.378
- Come on, let's go.
- When do you gotta go?

54:13.411 --> 54:14.379
Fuck you.

54:14.412 --> 54:17.583
Yeah, Pete. Uh,
I'm not gonna make that tryout.

54:17.617 --> 54:19.752
Listen, I really appreciate
everything you've been doing, okay.

54:19.786 --> 54:22.088
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Jackie, where are you?</i>

54:22.121 --> 54:25.024
- I'm at the motel.
- <i>Stay where you are. I'll be right there.</i>

54:39.437 --> 54:41.040
Get in.

54:41.073 --> 54:45.611
- Pete, I can't. I'm sorry. I...
- Jackie, we got half an hour to get to Hackensack

54:45.645 --> 54:47.146
and I swear to God, if you
blow this and embarrass me,

54:47.180 --> 54:50.750
I'll make sure the only place you
ball will be your fucking living room.

54:50.783 --> 54:52.450
Get in, you degenerate.

54:58.958 --> 55:00.760
Nice day for a tryout.

55:02.295 --> 55:05.665
I... I know you're nervous. You've been
running your mouth the whole month.

55:05.698 --> 55:08.000
Look at this fucking guy.

55:09.467 --> 55:11.704
He's a good ball player though,
so are you.

55:11.737 --> 55:12.905
I mean I've been
in this business a long time.

55:12.939 --> 55:16.474
You've got one of the purest
jump shots I have ever seen.

55:16.508 --> 55:17.677
I don't know about that.

55:18.878 --> 55:20.079
Hey, you know what,
you're lucky.

55:20.112 --> 55:22.480
You got a chance
to fix a lot of wrongs.

55:22.514 --> 55:26.052
It's something most people from
our neighborhood never get to do.

55:26.085 --> 55:28.855
You know, like, like me, right. Most of
the guys of my age went off to Vietnam.

55:28.888 --> 55:30.890
I was in the Airborne
Special Forces,

55:30.923 --> 55:32.490
but I never even left
the country.

55:33.425 --> 55:35.828
Now, I get to write
about basketball.

55:37.830 --> 55:39.565
You know,
when I started at <i>The Post</i>,

55:39.599 --> 55:41.100
they said the NBA
would never last.

55:41.133 --> 55:45.538
Now, look what here we are.
Here you are.

55:45.571 --> 55:47.540
Hey, you know, you didn't have
to give me this shot?

55:48.574 --> 55:50.009
I appreciate it.

55:50.042 --> 55:52.879
Ah, what can I say?
I like an underdog.

55:52.912 --> 55:54.479
Come on, let's go.

56:18.771 --> 56:20.973
Hey, you got to sign in there.

56:26.245 --> 56:28.114
- They're asking for representation?
- It's your agent.

56:30.482 --> 56:31.951
Look at that.
Marty was right. Huh?

57:21.901 --> 57:23.102
Welcome to the big leagues.

57:24.670 --> 57:28.107
Alright, good morning fellas. Uh,
I'm Coach Carlyle. This is Coach Johnson.

57:28.140 --> 57:30.609
Coach, uh, Fitch is on his way
down shortly.

57:30.643 --> 57:34.512
In the meantime, I want to welcome you
to open tryouts for the New Jersey Nets.

57:34.547 --> 57:36.282
Thanks so much
for taking some time.

57:36.315 --> 57:39.819
Now, we're not expecting much, but we've been
known to find a few diamonds in the rough,

57:39.852 --> 57:43.089
so I want to get you guys through
some basic conditioning drills.

57:43.122 --> 57:45.858
I want to see what you do
with our motion offense

57:45.891 --> 57:47.860
and then we're going to let you
run up and down in scrimmage.

57:47.893 --> 57:50.796
We want to see you working hard
and we want to see who can play.

57:50.830 --> 57:53.165
Now, it's one of those days,
fellas.

57:53.199 --> 57:55.901
One of those days that could be the
first day of the rest of your life.

57:55.935 --> 57:59.171
So, I'm gonna have half you
on this side put on red jerseys,

57:59.205 --> 58:01.140
the other half
put on blue jerseys,

58:01.173 --> 58:03.709
hit the locker rooms and we'll see you
out here in five minutes for lay-ups.

58:03.743 --> 58:06.045
Two claps. Go.

58:29.769 --> 58:30.636
Hey.

58:32.004 --> 58:34.640
Well, Willis Reed says,
"I remember playing with you, old man."

58:34.673 --> 58:35.908
- Oh, that's very funny.
- Huh.

58:35.941 --> 58:37.209
Hey, who are those guys
over there?

58:37.243 --> 58:39.779
Oh, just some European scouts.

58:39.812 --> 58:42.281
Guys looking to fill up
their roster with professionals.

58:42.314 --> 58:43.282
Uh, I better impress them.

58:43.315 --> 58:47.219
From your lips to God's ears.
Don't fuck up.

58:54.393 --> 58:55.261
Hey.

59:18.050 --> 59:18.984
Push everyone.

59:22.288 --> 59:24.623
That's it. That's it.
That's easy. That's easy.

59:24.657 --> 59:26.125
Easy work.

59:26.158 --> 59:28.661
Come on, man.
I've seen this match every time, baby.

59:28.694 --> 59:29.795
Come on, man.

59:29.829 --> 59:31.797
Light work, light work..

59:31.831 --> 59:33.666
Okay, let me see that.
Let me see that.

59:47.346 --> 59:49.682
- Come on. Let's go.
- Where's the fucking offense?

59:49.715 --> 59:51.750
Play some defense.

59:56.956 --> 59:58.057
What's up, J, baby?

59:59.758 --> 1:00:01.427
If you guys
don't run the offense,

1:00:01.460 --> 1:00:02.695
we're gonna be running
fucking laps.

1:00:02.728 --> 1:00:06.832
If I say pass the ball in the
post, pass the ball in the post.

1:00:06.866 --> 1:00:08.300
Move the fucking ball.

1:00:08.334 --> 1:00:09.902
And what the fuck are you doing?

1:00:10.936 --> 1:00:11.971
You understand me?

1:00:12.905 --> 1:00:14.907
Now, run the offense, Jackie.

1:00:19.445 --> 1:00:22.381
Jack Ryan, you want to play
point guard in the NBA?

1:00:22.414 --> 1:00:23.816
I'm here.

1:00:23.849 --> 1:00:24.717
I'm here.

1:00:24.750 --> 1:00:26.418
Yeah, there's no fucking.

1:00:26.452 --> 1:00:27.386
Keep going.

1:00:27.419 --> 1:00:29.388
Give me the fucking ball.

1:00:33.325 --> 1:00:38.164
Hey, hey, hey.
You, shut up. You're just happy to be here.

1:00:38.197 --> 1:00:40.166
Ryan, what the fuck
are you doing?

1:00:42.134 --> 1:00:44.136
Motherfucker.
Everybody, line up.

1:00:45.271 --> 1:00:46.405
Stay away from him.

1:00:46.438 --> 1:00:48.841
Hey, Malibu. Stay away from him.

1:00:48.874 --> 1:00:53.746
Alright, that's it, guys.
Hit the showers. Except for you two.

1:00:53.779 --> 1:00:55.080
Baseline.

1:00:56.415 --> 1:00:57.816
How many, Coach?

1:00:58.918 --> 1:01:00.786
Until I say so.

1:01:04.023 --> 1:01:05.858
You kept the Irish kid
around?

1:01:05.891 --> 1:01:08.093
Yeah, what can I say?
I have a soft spot for him.

1:01:08.127 --> 1:01:10.429
They make an introduction.
I like what I see.

1:01:10.462 --> 1:01:11.897
Yeah, our crowds would love him.

1:01:11.931 --> 1:01:15.768
Yeah, I'm sure, but he's, uh,
he's not popping balloons for you yet.

1:01:15.801 --> 1:01:16.902
He's still mine.

1:01:18.170 --> 1:01:19.271
Let's go.

1:01:22.508 --> 1:01:24.176
Now hit the showers.

1:01:26.879 --> 1:01:27.913
I'll talk to you later.

1:01:31.016 --> 1:01:33.352
Alright, man. Let's...

1:01:43.530 --> 1:01:44.396
Oh, God!

1:01:49.301 --> 1:01:51.937
Ah! Motherfucker!

1:02:01.180 --> 1:02:07.419
- Coach! Coach! Coach!
- You alright, Jackie?

1:02:10.322 --> 1:02:12.491
- Yeah.
- Get the fuck off the floor. Let's go.

1:02:18.831 --> 1:02:19.832
Alright, Jackie.

1:02:48.527 --> 1:02:51.130
Motherfucker.

1:02:51.163 --> 1:02:54.433
Fuck you, motherfucker.
Fuck you.

1:02:54.466 --> 1:02:58.170
You bullshit ass motherfucker,
fouls every fucking time.

1:02:58.203 --> 1:02:59.271
Fuck you, Gill.

1:02:59.305 --> 1:03:02.007
You little bitch ass
come back to the neighborhood.

1:03:02.041 --> 1:03:04.209
You little bitch. Fuck.

1:03:04.243 --> 1:03:07.413
Alright, Ryan that's it. You're done. Goodbye.

1:03:07.446 --> 1:03:08.380
Day's over.

1:03:09.281 --> 1:03:10.583
Hit the showers, dude.

1:03:18.357 --> 1:03:20.893
Okay, everybody else,
let's get back to work. Let's go.

1:03:20.926 --> 1:03:22.428
Red ball coming down this way.

1:03:22.461 --> 1:03:26.932
Stay up all night drink beer,
wake up,

1:03:26.965 --> 1:03:29.401
score 40 points
like it was nothing.

1:03:29.435 --> 1:03:32.471
- Ryan, how's the knee?
- It's alright.

1:03:32.504 --> 1:03:36.108
Good. Listen, I want to introduce you to
Todd Davis. He owns a professional team.

1:03:36.141 --> 1:03:37.943
Harlem Wizards. Heard of 'em?

1:03:37.976 --> 1:03:39.978
Yeah, I know Speedy and Tojo.

1:03:40.012 --> 1:03:41.080
You guys entertain kids?

1:03:41.113 --> 1:03:44.651
Well, that's part of it.
We are a professional team.

1:03:44.684 --> 1:03:46.985
We travel and we offer
guaranteed contracts.

1:03:50.022 --> 1:03:54.026
Yeah, I appreciate that, but my, uh,
my head's with the Nets right now.

1:03:54.059 --> 1:03:55.260
Yeah, I understand.

1:03:55.294 --> 1:03:58.297
But you hang on to that card
and you think about it, okay?

1:03:58.330 --> 1:04:01.400
And, uh, Jack, when you're
open, shoot the ball.

1:04:05.104 --> 1:04:06.505
Yeah, you got it, Coach.

1:04:11.944 --> 1:04:13.646
You know, I told the coach
to take it easy on you.

1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:16.382
Yeah, I told them the same thing about you.

1:04:16.415 --> 1:04:17.249
Heads up!

1:04:17.282 --> 1:04:19.084
Don't think I forgot
about yesterday?

1:04:21.588 --> 1:04:24.957
You know you're a disgrace to the
fucking neighborhood, you know that?

1:04:24.990 --> 1:04:26.659
You got it easy, you know that?

1:04:26.693 --> 1:04:28.628
- I got it easy?
- Yeah, you got... How do I got it fucking easy?

1:04:28.661 --> 1:04:30.996
You got it easy with your
little bitch ass Rolls Royce.

1:04:31.029 --> 1:04:32.699
How the fuck you get
a Rolls Royce?

1:04:32.732 --> 1:04:34.032
Look at your skin.

1:04:34.734 --> 1:04:35.602
Yeah.

1:04:50.249 --> 1:04:51.350
Coach.

1:04:51.383 --> 1:04:53.285
Listen, I... uh,
I know you're hurt,

1:04:53.318 --> 1:04:56.088
but you don't seem like the type of
guy that likes a lot of bullshit.

1:04:56.121 --> 1:04:59.592
I'm not gonna lie to you. I could use a
little smoke blown up my ass right about now.

1:04:59.626 --> 1:05:01.093
Uh, well,
you ever play in Europe?

1:05:01.126 --> 1:05:03.530
No, no.
This was my first tryout ever.

1:05:03.563 --> 1:05:06.031
Alright, well,
you didn't make it this year.

1:05:06.064 --> 1:05:09.234
Okay, but you don't need, uh,
Vecsey to come back next year.

1:05:09.268 --> 1:05:10.436
I'm inviting you.

1:05:11.538 --> 1:05:13.205
Thanks, Coach.

1:05:13.238 --> 1:05:15.140
- Alright and good luck to you.
- Thanks.

1:05:15.174 --> 1:05:18.210
And stay in shape
and, uh, keep shooting.

1:05:18.243 --> 1:05:19.546
Always.

1:05:43.335 --> 1:05:45.605
Whoa! How'd it go?

1:05:47.506 --> 1:05:49.508
You look like a bag of shit.

1:05:49.542 --> 1:05:52.077
You look like
an orphaned raccoon.

1:05:52.110 --> 1:05:54.379
Yeah, I tried to get you a limousine,
but I'm not that type of agent.

1:05:54.413 --> 1:05:57.015
Yo, you missed the show I put on in there, man.

1:05:57.049 --> 1:05:58.618
Uh-huh.

1:05:58.651 --> 1:06:00.352
I see they left you
with a fishing pole.

1:06:00.385 --> 1:06:01.721
Yeah, a cheap one.

1:06:03.455 --> 1:06:05.491
The guys at Faros
want to throw you a big party.

1:06:05.524 --> 1:06:07.426
I'm good. I feel like a bum.

1:06:07.459 --> 1:06:10.095
Ah, come on. Stop it.
Then we'll buy you a drink.

1:06:11.096 --> 1:06:12.532
I just want to see Jenny, bro.

1:06:12.565 --> 1:06:15.167
Ah, shit.

1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:18.370
Listen, do me a favor.
Don't act like a jackass, alright?

1:06:18.403 --> 1:06:19.806
Why are you acting so nervous?

1:06:19.839 --> 1:06:22.542
I'm not acting nervous. I got seven
pounds of weed in the car, okay?

1:06:22.575 --> 1:06:24.009
Just play it cool.

1:06:33.853 --> 1:06:35.053
Gentlemen.

1:06:35.087 --> 1:06:35.788
Hey, Officer.

1:06:37.322 --> 1:06:39.157
You know why I pulled you over?

1:06:39.191 --> 1:06:41.159
Yeah, I... I blew the stop sign.
I'm sorry.

1:06:41.193 --> 1:06:42.528
I was just talking
to my friend here.

1:06:42.562 --> 1:06:44.263
How you doing?

1:06:44.296 --> 1:06:45.430
You guys been drinking?

1:06:45.464 --> 1:06:47.499
No, absolutely not.

1:06:47.534 --> 1:06:50.135
What's going on with you two?
What's with the face and the crutches?

1:06:50.168 --> 1:06:54.273
Oh, no. I... I got hit in the face with a
basketball and, uh, he, he hurt his knee.

1:06:54.306 --> 1:06:55.340
He's a ball player.

1:06:57.142 --> 1:06:58.778
Let me see your license
and registration.

1:07:00.178 --> 1:07:01.446
Hey, Jackie, do me a favor?
Get my registration.

1:07:05.618 --> 1:07:06.753
Sit tight.
I'll be right back.

1:07:09.822 --> 1:07:12.625
- Stop acting nervous.
- Stop acting nervous?

1:07:15.828 --> 1:07:17.062
I'm gonna write you boys
a ticket.

1:07:18.531 --> 1:07:20.265
Pay attention, alright. There's kids
running around the neighborhood.

1:07:20.299 --> 1:07:21.233
- Right.
- Alright?

1:07:21.266 --> 1:07:22.467
Alright, sorry, Officer.

1:07:34.681 --> 1:07:35.982
What?

1:07:36.015 --> 1:07:38.517
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Relax, nothing happened.

1:07:38.551 --> 1:07:39.418
Are you a fucking idiot?

1:07:39.451 --> 1:07:41.086
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

1:07:41.119 --> 1:07:45.324
Jackie, relax. Okay? I was holding the
weed to pay back the Dominican, remember?

1:07:45.357 --> 1:07:47.594
Oh, probably not because, you
know, you became such a big shot.

1:07:47.627 --> 1:07:50.763
It had nothing to do with me.
The Dominican shit was you, remember?

1:07:50.797 --> 1:07:51.598
Do you remember?

1:07:51.631 --> 1:07:53.398
Dragging me
into that shit again!

1:07:53.432 --> 1:07:54.834
Wait, so this is all on me?

1:07:54.867 --> 1:07:57.904
It's always fucking you, taking me
away from training, my fucking girl,

1:07:57.937 --> 1:08:01.741
anything positive in my life just
to make your miserable ass happy.

1:08:01.774 --> 1:08:04.276
- Oh, wait so I'm the reason that you didn't make the team?
- I didn't say that.

1:08:04.309 --> 1:08:05.712
Yeah, well,
it sounded like that, Jackie.

1:08:05.745 --> 1:08:08.347
You know what, now that we're being
so fucking honest with each other,

1:08:08.380 --> 1:08:09.649
you know what you are?

1:08:09.682 --> 1:08:11.751
You're a selfish piece of shit.

1:08:11.784 --> 1:08:12.885
Your old man
was right about you.

1:08:12.919 --> 1:08:14.821
Don't fucking...
Take that back, Marty, right now.

1:08:14.854 --> 1:08:16.856
Take that back right now
before I beat your fucking ass.

1:08:16.889 --> 1:08:18.791
Take what back?
What are you fucking fifth-grade?

1:08:18.825 --> 1:08:20.593
- I ain't taking nothing back.
- Let me out of this fucking car.

1:08:20.627 --> 1:08:21.794
- I'm getting the fuck out of here.
- You gonna walk?

1:08:21.828 --> 1:08:22.762
- Yeah.
- Well...

1:08:22.795 --> 1:08:25.297
- Fuck you. Motherfucking...
- With one leg?

1:08:25.330 --> 1:08:27.567
- Fuck you!
- Well, good. Fucking walk. Fuck you!

1:08:28.500 --> 1:08:29.602
Fuck you.

1:08:29.636 --> 1:08:31.904
You're lucky I got one
fucking leg, you little bitch.

1:08:31.938 --> 1:08:34.139
Fuck you.

1:08:38.945 --> 1:08:39.912
I got it.

1:08:50.890 --> 1:08:52.190
What's going on, Jackie?

1:08:53.225 --> 1:08:53.893
Hey, Pop.

1:08:55.895 --> 1:08:59.264
I got nowhere to go.

1:09:00.767 --> 1:09:03.603
Alright, well, you're gonna have
to start paying rent now.

1:09:04.904 --> 1:09:05.772
Yeah.

1:09:06.773 --> 1:09:07.807
Come on in.

1:09:09.709 --> 1:09:12.177
He didn't make the team.
Don't say anything.

1:09:19.451 --> 1:09:23.388
- I'm so sorry, Jackie.
- Me, too, buddy.

1:09:23.422 --> 1:09:24.791
Their loss.

1:09:24.824 --> 1:09:25.958
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1:09:28.460 --> 1:09:30.429
- Hey, you alright?
- Yeah.

1:09:31.798 --> 1:09:32.899
I'll talk to you about it later.

1:09:34.901 --> 1:09:36.268
I'm gonna go upstairs.

1:09:38.805 --> 1:09:41.506
He doesn't need your pity,
alright?

1:09:41.541 --> 1:09:42.742
Don't start with me.

1:09:42.775 --> 1:09:44.342
I'm just getting him ice
for his knee.

1:09:52.350 --> 1:09:54.687
Farrell, one more.

1:09:54.721 --> 1:09:55.655
Give me one more drink.

1:09:59.659 --> 1:10:01.961
Jackie. Hey.

1:10:01.994 --> 1:10:04.797
You done. I gotta cut you off.

1:10:04.831 --> 1:10:06.933
I need one fucking drink.

1:10:06.966 --> 1:10:08.868
Give me one more fucking drink.
One more fucking drink.

1:10:08.901 --> 1:10:10.536
One more. Just give me...

1:10:10.570 --> 1:10:13.371
Hey, we're closing up shop.
Come on, you gotta go.

1:10:14.874 --> 1:10:15.742
You're done.

1:10:44.070 --> 1:10:46.639
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hey, Chrissy, how you doing?

1:10:46.672 --> 1:10:48.775
<i>So,
you don't know what time it is?</i>

1:10:48.808 --> 1:10:52.712
No, no, no, no.
I know it's late. I'm sorry.

1:10:52.745 --> 1:10:55.413
I just wanted to talk to you
for a sec, you know.

1:10:55.447 --> 1:10:56.883
<i>What is it, Jackie?</i>

1:10:59.719 --> 1:11:01.587
I want out, Chrissy.

1:11:02.521 --> 1:11:04.557
You know,
I just want fucking out.

1:11:04.590 --> 1:11:06.225
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1:11:06.259 --> 1:11:10.328
If I had any fucking balls, I'd put a bullet
in my fucking head but I fucking care.

1:11:10.362 --> 1:11:13.065
<i>Call Father Brennan.
You should talk to him.</i>

1:11:13.099 --> 1:11:15.535
I don't want to call Father Brennan.
I want to talk to you.

1:11:15.568 --> 1:11:18.838
I want to talk to you right now. You're
family, I want to fucking talk to you.

1:11:18.871 --> 1:11:20.673
<i>I can't do this
right now, Jackie.</i>

1:11:20.706 --> 1:11:22.575
- Chrissy!
- <i>You're going to wake up the girls.</i>

1:11:22.608 --> 1:11:23.943
Chrissy!

1:11:23.976 --> 1:11:25.912
Fuck!

1:11:28.581 --> 1:11:29.682
Fucking bitch!

1:11:32.417 --> 1:11:33.085
Shit!

1:11:36.622 --> 1:11:38.925
<i>It's Father Brennan.
Leave a message. God bless.</i>

1:11:40.626 --> 1:11:42.829
Father, it's...
it's Jackie Ryan.

1:11:42.862 --> 1:11:46.833
I could really, really talk
to you right now, you know.

1:11:46.866 --> 1:11:51.871
So, if you could call me back,
you know, the number and, uh...

1:12:09.989 --> 1:12:11.356
Alright, Brian, we're good.

1:12:12.091 --> 1:12:13.793
Oh, man.

1:12:24.904 --> 1:12:26.105
Oh, shit!

1:12:30.676 --> 1:12:32.578
Yo, Jackie.
Show us some of them tricks, man?

1:12:32.612 --> 1:12:33.746
No. Not today, man.

1:12:34.914 --> 1:12:36.649
Yo, get over yourself, man.

1:12:36.682 --> 1:12:38.951
Yo, listen, Brian.
This guy think he too good for us now.

1:12:38.985 --> 1:12:40.820
Did I fucking say that?

1:12:40.853 --> 1:12:42.755
- What the fuck's the matter with you?
- Hey, what you so angry for?

1:12:42.788 --> 1:12:44.489
I thought your father
don't want you around no more.

1:12:44.522 --> 1:12:46.058
Why you gotta bring up
my fucking father, man?

1:12:46.092 --> 1:12:47.593
You know I don't fucking play
no more.

1:12:47.627 --> 1:12:49.494
Come on, man. Come on.
Here you go. Here you go.

1:12:49.527 --> 1:12:50.763
Come on, you got it in you.

1:12:50.796 --> 1:12:52.632
- You want to see your fucking trick, huh?
- Yeah.

1:12:52.665 --> 1:12:53.866
- You like that? Huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:12:53.900 --> 1:12:55.835
Does that get you off, huh?
Motherfucker.

1:12:57.637 --> 1:12:59.939
That's what I'm talking about
and that's the Jackie I know.

1:12:59.972 --> 1:13:02.174
Right there, all pro, baby.

1:13:03.508 --> 1:13:04.911
Yo, don't hurt yourself, man.

1:13:04.944 --> 1:13:06.712
This guy is crazy.

1:13:06.746 --> 1:13:09.514
Piece of fucking shit.

1:13:11.751 --> 1:13:12.818
Motherfucker.

1:13:14.854 --> 1:13:17.056
Yo, don't hurt yourself, man.
Don't hurt yourself.

1:13:24.964 --> 1:13:26.966
Perfect timing. I just fixed it.

1:13:31.871 --> 1:13:33.139
Did anyone call for me?

1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:35.141
No, Jackie.

1:13:37.509 --> 1:13:39.912
- Baby, could you get some groceries for me?
- Yeah.

1:13:39.946 --> 1:13:42.748
Don't you see he just got home
from a hard day's work?

1:13:42.782 --> 1:13:43.683
Dad, I got it. I'm fine.

1:13:43.716 --> 1:13:46.218
I forgot to get salt
and I need potatoes.

1:13:46.252 --> 1:13:47.485
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:13:47.519 --> 1:13:50.823
- Jackie.
- What?

1:13:50.856 --> 1:13:54.026
If you... if you want to talk
to someone, my friend Annie,

1:13:54.060 --> 1:13:56.762
her sister is a therapist,
it might be good to talk it out.

1:13:56.796 --> 1:14:00.066
Ma, I'm good. Alright. I... I shouldn't
have called Chrissy the other night.

1:14:00.099 --> 1:14:02.635
I was a little fucked up in the head.
I'm... I'm good.

1:14:02.668 --> 1:14:03.769
Alright? I love you.

1:14:03.803 --> 1:14:05.271
I promise you.

1:14:05.304 --> 1:14:07.173
Alright, he doesn't need
a head doctor.

1:14:13.279 --> 1:14:15.281
He's gonna be fine
once he gets his paychecks,

1:14:15.314 --> 1:14:17.750
money in his pocket,
he'll feel great.

1:14:24.557 --> 1:14:25.791
- Get in the car.
- Huh?

1:14:25.825 --> 1:14:28.594
- Get in the car.
- I'm gonna drop these off to Ma.

1:14:28.627 --> 1:14:30.029
- I'm almost home.
- Shh!

1:14:30.062 --> 1:14:31.496
Don't make me
get out of this car.

1:14:36.802 --> 1:14:37.937
Okay, put on this tie.

1:14:37.970 --> 1:14:39.739
- What's this?
- It's a tie.

1:14:39.772 --> 1:14:40.673
Do you know how to tie it?

1:14:40.706 --> 1:14:43.142
- Absolutely fucking not.
- I'll show you.

1:14:47.813 --> 1:14:48.914
Is that him?

1:14:48.948 --> 1:14:50.816
- Yeah.
- Alright, come on.

1:14:55.821 --> 1:14:57.123
You know my son Jackie?

1:14:57.156 --> 1:14:58.924
Hey, gentlemen,
how you doing today?

1:14:58.958 --> 1:15:01.627
Uh, unfortunately,
Jackie already knows what he needs to do

1:15:01.660 --> 1:15:03.195
in order to open an account
with us here.

1:15:03.229 --> 1:15:05.865
Told you, Pops.
It's always the same shit with this guy.

1:15:06.932 --> 1:15:08.167
Well, listen here,
you little shit!

1:15:08.200 --> 1:15:10.936
I've been coming to this bank
for over 40 years. You hear me?

1:15:10.970 --> 1:15:13.072
Long before you were even
a glint in your daddy's eye,

1:15:13.105 --> 1:15:14.974
so don't talk to me
about credit history.

1:15:15.007 --> 1:15:16.709
We're the Ryan family, okay?

1:15:16.742 --> 1:15:18.144
- Sir.
- Do you understand that?

1:15:18.177 --> 1:15:20.913
Maybe, if you don't understand that,
I should go talk to your manager

1:15:20.946 --> 1:15:25.818
- whose brother I've been working alongside for the past 20 years.
- Sir, that's not necessary.

1:15:25.851 --> 1:15:29.722
That will not be necessary. Jackie,
welcome to the banking family over here.

1:15:29.755 --> 1:15:31.991
Stephanie will get you
taken care of on Sunday.

1:15:32.024 --> 1:15:32.892
Appreciate it.

1:15:33.726 --> 1:15:34.994
Does this mean
I got a credit card?

1:15:35.928 --> 1:15:37.897
- Holy shit!
- Thank you.

1:15:37.930 --> 1:15:39.198
Have a great day, Mr. Ryan.

1:15:39.231 --> 1:15:41.367
- Sorry, I get a little heated.
- Yeah, it happens.

1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:43.202
Yeah, alright.
Let's go talk to Stephanie.

1:15:43.235 --> 1:15:44.303
Stephanie.

1:15:44.336 --> 1:15:46.605
Farrell, you had me put it in.

1:15:46.639 --> 1:15:48.774
Are you fucking kidding me?
The guy's down at half a hundred.

1:15:48.808 --> 1:15:51.377
Don't give him any more fucking action.
We're gonna lose money here.

1:15:51.410 --> 1:15:54.313
You had me put it in and you don't like me to tell you.

1:15:54.346 --> 1:15:56.749
Hold on. Hello, Faros.

1:15:56.782 --> 1:15:58.617
<i>Hi, is there a Marty there?</i>

1:15:58.651 --> 1:16:00.286
Yeah. Who's this?

1:16:00.319 --> 1:16:01.854
<i>It's Todd Davis.</i>

1:16:01.887 --> 1:16:03.622
Yeah, hold on.

1:16:04.390 --> 1:16:08.661
What? You're fucking taking phone
calls here now? It's for you.

1:16:08.694 --> 1:16:10.062
- Me?
- Yeah.

1:16:12.298 --> 1:16:13.567
It's Marty.

1:16:13.599 --> 1:16:16.068
<i>This is Todd Davis,
owner of the Harlem Wizards.</i>

1:16:16.102 --> 1:16:17.703
- Who?
- <i>Todd Davis.</i>

1:16:17.736 --> 1:16:20.106
- <i>I understand you're Jackie's agent.</i>
- Yeah.

1:16:20.139 --> 1:16:21.841
Yeah, I'm his agent.

1:16:21.874 --> 1:16:24.043
<i>I'd love to have you guys here
and come to speak to us about a tryout.</i>

1:16:24.076 --> 1:16:26.112
- Sure.
- <i>We're here on 34th and 7th.</i>

1:16:26.145 --> 1:16:27.847
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
I'm down there.

1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:29.648
- <i>Tuesday night, 6 p.m.</i>
- Thanks.

1:16:31.150 --> 1:16:34.386
Farrell, do me a favor. I'll, uh,
I'll settle up with you when I get back.

1:16:44.330 --> 1:16:45.264
Come on, baby.

1:16:46.432 --> 1:16:47.466
Ma, wait.

1:16:47.500 --> 1:16:49.735
How come there's no potato chips
in the casserole?

1:16:49.768 --> 1:16:51.704
Oh, 'cause Chrissy's counting
her calories.

1:16:51.737 --> 1:16:52.972
- Yeah, Billy.
- What?

1:16:53.005 --> 1:16:54.707
What are calories?

1:16:54.740 --> 1:16:55.841
That's what make your mom
look fat.

1:16:55.875 --> 1:16:57.977
- Hey.
- Am I gonna be fat?

1:16:58.010 --> 1:16:59.311
I mean,
you're not getting any skinnier.

1:16:59.345 --> 1:17:00.045
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- You see what you start?

1:17:00.079 --> 1:17:01.680
- Seriously...
- I don't care.

1:17:01.714 --> 1:17:04.183
- I just want the potato chips in the casserole.
- Will you two stop?

1:17:04.216 --> 1:17:08.988
Nobody's getting fat, especially not
your grandmother, magical princess.

1:17:11.891 --> 1:17:12.992
Easy, that's enough dear.

1:17:13.025 --> 1:17:14.193
Yeah. Hey, Dad.

1:17:14.226 --> 1:17:15.528
The doc told you
you got to cut that out.

1:17:15.562 --> 1:17:18.998
Jesus, that's salt. And who made
you Dr. Quinn all of a sudden?

1:17:20.166 --> 1:17:24.203
You know, Billy mentioned the guys down at
work were asking when you're gonna come back.

1:17:25.337 --> 1:17:27.072
That's great.

1:17:27.106 --> 1:17:30.442
Jackie, it's true. I mean, the guys at the
site don't care that you didn't make the team

1:17:30.476 --> 1:17:31.777
and we could really use
your help.

1:17:33.078 --> 1:17:36.482
- Okay.
- Well, come on, Jackie. Just say Grace so we can eat.

1:17:36.515 --> 1:17:38.050
Alright, thank God. Let's eat.

1:17:38.083 --> 1:17:39.852
Hello, hello,
Ryan family.

1:17:39.885 --> 1:17:41.854
Oh, are you hungry?

1:17:41.887 --> 1:17:43.355
No, no thank you.
I'm good.

1:17:43.389 --> 1:17:45.925
- What are you dressed like that... for someone?
- You look like a clown.

1:17:45.958 --> 1:17:49.295
Oh, look. I'm selling insurance
with my uncle. Uh, can we talk?

1:17:49.328 --> 1:17:51.063
Yeah, go ahead.
It's a free country.

1:17:51.096 --> 1:17:52.932
Uh, I mean, you guys are eating.
In private.

1:17:52.965 --> 1:17:55.501
Did you close the backdoor
'cause I got the AC on?

1:17:55.535 --> 1:17:56.670
I always shut the back door,
Big Jack.

1:17:56.702 --> 1:17:59.872
- Come on, it's about business.
- What kind of business?

1:17:59.905 --> 1:18:02.074
I'm not buying anything you're selling
looking like a car salesman over here.

1:18:02.107 --> 1:18:04.076
Yo, fuck off, Marty.

1:18:04.109 --> 1:18:07.346
No, it's a business of me
being your agent, Jackie.

1:18:09.415 --> 1:18:11.750
You're funny, Marty.
You're really funny.

1:18:11.784 --> 1:18:13.118
Jackie,
I'm serious on my mother.

1:18:13.152 --> 1:18:15.888
I got a call today from the owner
of a professional basketball team.

1:18:15.921 --> 1:18:16.889
They want you
to try out for them.

1:18:19.992 --> 1:18:20.859
Yeah.

1:18:21.561 --> 1:18:22.528
I got to work tomorrow.

1:18:22.562 --> 1:18:25.831
Jackie, go, come on.

1:18:25.864 --> 1:18:26.999
Come on, Jackie.

1:18:27.032 --> 1:18:28.467
Just go. I'll save your plate.

1:18:28.500 --> 1:18:30.537
Yeah, look.
The past is the past between us.

1:18:30.570 --> 1:18:32.404
- You should do it.
- Yeah.

1:18:33.305 --> 1:18:36.342
Hey, go ahead.
Come on, thank God.

1:18:36.375 --> 1:18:39.011
The monk's gonna finally leave
the monastery.

1:18:39.044 --> 1:18:40.412
I'll be at Faros, alright?

1:18:42.314 --> 1:18:46.051
- Thank you. Mwah!
- Love you, Ma.

1:18:46.085 --> 1:18:47.920
Yo, so who called?
What's going on?

1:18:48.821 --> 1:18:50.389
The owner of the Harlem Wizards.

1:18:50.422 --> 1:18:52.191
So, you think
he's the real deal?

1:18:52.224 --> 1:18:53.892
Is he blowing smoke up your ass
or what?

1:18:53.926 --> 1:18:55.294
You met him at the tryouts.

1:18:55.327 --> 1:18:57.263
Of course, he's the real deal, Jackie.
Why else would I be here?

1:18:58.964 --> 1:18:59.865
Excuse me.

1:18:59.898 --> 1:19:01.233
Hey, hey, hey, hey. No.

1:19:01.267 --> 1:19:03.502
Not if I don't get my potato chips,
you calorie count motherfucker.

1:19:03.536 --> 1:19:04.937
Are you kidding me
with that right now?

1:19:04.970 --> 1:19:06.839
- Don't curse in front of the children.
- I don't... it's not my fault.

1:19:06.872 --> 1:19:07.973
Ear muffs, baby,
earmuffs.

1:19:08.007 --> 1:19:09.408
Don't you fucking curse
in front of the fucking kids.

1:19:09.441 --> 1:19:10.776
What, you want to be healthy,
huh, huh?

1:19:10.809 --> 1:19:12.144
- Here's some fucking green beans.
- Oh, wow, are you kidding me?

1:19:12.177 --> 1:19:13.145
Mom!

1:19:13.178 --> 1:19:14.581
I just want the potato chips
in the casserole.

1:19:14.614 --> 1:19:16.515
- What... how...
- I want your napkin off the table.

1:19:16.549 --> 1:19:18.150
I can't believe I still live...

1:19:22.121 --> 1:19:25.224
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, they think maybe...
maybe a heart attack.

1:19:25.257 --> 1:19:26.292
He's gonna be fine.

1:19:26.325 --> 1:19:27.293
Hey, go get the car.

1:19:27.326 --> 1:19:29.562
- Okay. Go, go.
- I... I need you to go with him.

1:19:29.596 --> 1:19:31.297
Go with him.
I have to get the girls up.

1:19:31.330 --> 1:19:33.299
Baby, I'm gonna meet you
at the hospital with the girls.

1:19:42.341 --> 1:19:43.442
Come in.

1:19:45.177 --> 1:19:50.082
- Hey, Pop.
- Hey, Saint Peter ain't cashing my checks,

1:19:50.115 --> 1:19:51.551
so you girls can relax.

1:19:53.118 --> 1:19:55.220
Did the bank send you
your credit card yet?

1:19:55.254 --> 1:19:57.923
- Yeah, yeah. I ran it up already.
- Jackie.

1:19:59.358 --> 1:20:03.062
Yeah, can... can you go find your...
your mother and your sisters.

1:20:03.095 --> 1:20:05.264
I... Someone stole my lighter

1:20:06.566 --> 1:20:09.902
and get the number of the
cute nurse while you're at it.

1:20:09.935 --> 1:20:10.936
Sure, Pops.

1:20:13.205 --> 1:20:15.074
You know, they're putting
warning labels on these things.

1:20:15.107 --> 1:20:17.109
Yeah. You can be a real asshole
sometimes, too.

1:20:18.911 --> 1:20:20.479
Yeah, newsflash.

1:20:20.512 --> 1:20:22.915
You trying to give me
a real heart attack?

1:20:22.948 --> 1:20:23.949
How do you feel?

1:20:25.618 --> 1:20:26.885
Damn, right.

1:20:33.192 --> 1:20:36.095
You know, when I was a kid,
I dreamed of being a football player.

1:20:37.597 --> 1:20:42.434
And out of high school, I got drafted
in the Navy. They sent me off to Korea.

1:20:42.468 --> 1:20:45.504
I was lucky enough to come back
with two good knees.

1:20:45.538 --> 1:20:47.574
But my old man
had other plans for me.

1:20:47.607 --> 1:20:52.111
No football, handed me a union
card, drove me down to the piers.

1:20:54.179 --> 1:20:57.617
I had just served my country and
he said, "They did you a favor."

1:20:58.585 --> 1:21:00.486
But that's the way
he looked at life.

1:21:01.987 --> 1:21:05.057
I was gonna go to work just like he
did, just like his father.

1:21:06.392 --> 1:21:09.962
Dad, I don't want that life.

1:21:09.995 --> 1:21:12.231
Well, what do you want to do,
Jackie?

1:21:13.700 --> 1:21:15.267
I'm gonna stop being a fuck up.

1:21:16.536 --> 1:21:19.972
I want to make this
basketball thing work for real.

1:21:20.005 --> 1:21:23.041
Well, sometimes what
we want isn't a God-given right

1:21:23.075 --> 1:21:26.445
and you gotta make
accommodations for reality.

1:21:28.748 --> 1:21:31.283
You gotta do something you love.

1:21:32.619 --> 1:21:38.323
And God must have given you
this ability for some reason.

1:21:38.357 --> 1:21:41.226
You haven't seen me play in years.
What the fuck are you talking about?

1:21:41.260 --> 1:21:44.664
Well, all I've been seeing is you walking
around like a zombie and I hate it.

1:21:51.003 --> 1:21:52.938
Go make a man out of yourself.

1:22:03.683 --> 1:22:05.017
Come in.

1:22:06.218 --> 1:22:08.287
- Hey, Pop.
- Hey.

1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:10.088
I found that cute nurse
you were talking about.

1:22:11.356 --> 1:22:15.060
Ah, yeah. I was joking.
It was for you.

1:22:15.093 --> 1:22:17.229
- Yeah, yeah. Come on, girls. Say hi to him.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:22:17.262 --> 1:22:18.565
Hey, girls. How are you?
Give me a kiss.

1:22:18.598 --> 1:22:20.299
Mwah!

1:22:20.332 --> 1:22:21.568
Are you okay?

1:22:21.601 --> 1:22:23.770
Yeah, I'm alright.
Were you guys scared?

1:22:23.803 --> 1:22:26.706
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, I wasn't scared.

1:22:27.607 --> 1:22:30.610
- I told them that you are going to be fine, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

1:22:30.643 --> 1:22:31.544
I'm gonna be fine.

1:22:31.578 --> 1:22:33.445
That you are going to look
after yourself.

1:22:33.479 --> 1:22:36.248
- Yeah. Right?
- Yeah. That's right.

1:22:37.449 --> 1:22:39.284
I'm feeling better already.

1:22:39.318 --> 1:22:40.219
What are you doing?

1:22:41.386 --> 1:22:42.454
It's my hair, huh?

1:22:42.488 --> 1:22:44.389
Jackie, get those
smokes out of your nose.

1:22:44.423 --> 1:22:46.191
Look at Uncle Jackie.

1:22:47.259 --> 1:22:48.795
- Hey, hey, where's my lighter?
- Hey!

1:22:48.828 --> 1:22:50.195
Where's my lighter?

1:22:50.229 --> 1:22:53.766
Jen, how you doing?

1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:55.467
I'm great. You?

1:22:55.501 --> 1:22:57.537
Yeah, I'm playing again.

1:22:57.570 --> 1:22:59.772
Yeah, you belong on the court.

1:22:59.806 --> 1:23:01.073
You're still seeing that guy?

1:23:02.809 --> 1:23:05.444
- How's your dad?
- I'm just saying, if you weren't seeing that guy,

1:23:05.477 --> 1:23:07.714
- we could grab a slice...
- You know what? Tell your family I said hello, okay?

1:23:07.747 --> 1:23:11.450
Wait, wait. I'm sorry, okay?
I... I fucked up.

1:23:11.483 --> 1:23:13.352
I'm sorry.

1:23:13.385 --> 1:23:15.187
- You did.
- I'm sorry.

1:23:19.659 --> 1:23:21.093
You should get back
to your game.

1:23:21.126 --> 1:23:23.295
Hold up, hold up.
Just hear me out.

1:23:23.328 --> 1:23:25.765
I regret most things
in my life, okay?

1:23:25.798 --> 1:23:28.400
Mainly because I can't keep my
mouth shut or my ego in check.

1:23:29.501 --> 1:23:32.104
But the thing I regret the most
is the things I didn't say to you.

1:23:34.172 --> 1:23:37.744
You are the most important thing
in my life and I miss you to bits.

1:23:41.313 --> 1:23:42.414
Guess what?

1:23:46.753 --> 1:23:48.053
I got a credit card.

1:23:49.822 --> 1:23:50.757
That's disgusting.

1:23:51.758 --> 1:23:52.825
Get a wallet.

1:23:54.192 --> 1:23:55.127
You look good.

1:23:56.629 --> 1:23:58.330
Yeah, I know.

1:24:01.534 --> 1:24:02.501
Yo, ball up.

1:24:03.803 --> 1:24:05.270
Oh, shit!

1:24:05.304 --> 1:24:07.239
I'm glad to see
you're so relaxed.

1:24:07.272 --> 1:24:09.374
You got this in the bag, right?

1:24:11.376 --> 1:24:14.847
Yeah, well that's what dad said and
he didn't fucking get the job, so...

1:24:14.881 --> 1:24:18.417
Hey, you've been on this site
since you were 18 years old.

1:24:18.450 --> 1:24:21.721
They'd be lucky to have you
as a foreman, remember that.

1:24:24.791 --> 1:24:26.726
I think I'm gonna ask Tammy
to marry me.

1:24:27.927 --> 1:24:29.562
What?

1:24:29.596 --> 1:24:35.735
Yeah, we talked about it and I just think
it's what's best for my girl, you know,

1:24:35.768 --> 1:24:37.670
and I just want to do good
for her, you know.

1:24:39.739 --> 1:24:41.173
I really need this promotion,
Jackie.

1:24:41.206 --> 1:24:45.878
Have you told mom and pops yet?
I mean, mom will be doing cartwheels.

1:24:45.912 --> 1:24:47.312
I ain't told nobody yet.

1:24:52.384 --> 1:24:53.786
But I could really use
a best man now.

1:24:56.956 --> 1:24:58.256
Are you serious?

1:24:58.290 --> 1:25:00.192
Yeah.

1:25:04.329 --> 1:25:05.898
I'm too nervous right now,
Jackie.

1:25:05.932 --> 1:25:08.166
- I need to go smoke a cigarette, okay.
- Go ahead.

1:25:16.208 --> 1:25:18.878
You know my brother's got this in the
bag, you might as well go home.

1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:30.489
Mr. Olson. How you doing?

1:25:30.522 --> 1:25:31.758
What are you doing here, Jackie?

1:25:31.791 --> 1:25:34.326
I... Sorry to barge in like that.
Do you mind if I sit down?

1:25:34.359 --> 1:25:36.528
- Yeah. Go right ahead.
- Thanks.

1:25:36.562 --> 1:25:38.765
I know Billy's coming in next.

1:25:38.798 --> 1:25:40.265
That's true. Is something wrong?

1:25:40.298 --> 1:25:44.469
No, no. I just wanted to say that I
really think he deserves this job.

1:25:44.503 --> 1:25:47.774
Well, you and I both know
that he's a strong candidate,

1:25:47.807 --> 1:25:50.877
but, uh, he has some marks
against him.

1:25:50.910 --> 1:25:52.277
I understand that.

1:25:52.310 --> 1:25:54.346
Uh, you see in my family,

1:25:54.379 --> 1:25:56.749
my dad says we're not
management material

1:25:56.783 --> 1:26:01.688
and that's probably true for me and my
dad, but Billy's different.

1:26:01.721 --> 1:26:05.692
You know, he's not perfect, but he's got
the respect of the guys like no other,

1:26:05.725 --> 1:26:09.261
always been by my dad's side,
he knows the business soup to nuts

1:26:10.295 --> 1:26:13.633
and I think your boss would be
lucky to have him as a foreman.

1:26:13.666 --> 1:26:15.300
That's all I wanted to say.

1:26:15.333 --> 1:26:16.836
- Thank you, Mr. Olson.
- Thank you.

1:26:16.869 --> 1:26:17.737
Appreciate it.

1:26:18.971 --> 1:26:19.939
Huh.

1:26:21.506 --> 1:26:24.242
We got a foreman in the car.

1:26:24.276 --> 1:26:27.647
- I can't believe he offered me the job in the room.
- You deserve it, Billy.

1:26:29.414 --> 1:26:31.751
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

1:26:31.784 --> 1:26:33.619
Looks like I'm gonna be
bossing people around now, Ma.

1:26:33.653 --> 1:26:34.954
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

1:26:34.987 --> 1:26:37.757
I'm gonna make you casserole
with chips.

1:26:37.790 --> 1:26:39.324
Tell me, tell me everything.

1:26:40.325 --> 1:26:42.662
Olson called me
after you left the room.

1:26:42.695 --> 1:26:44.463
He told me what you did.

1:26:44.496 --> 1:26:45.998
You're a good brother.

1:26:46.032 --> 1:26:47.399
You would have done
the same thing, Pop.

1:26:47.432 --> 1:26:48.701
Not like that.

1:26:50.469 --> 1:26:55.507
Ah, that was touching. I mean, that was
like a really, true Ryan "feeling me" moment.

1:26:55.541 --> 1:26:57.610
- I think, I think my...
- Yo, what's going on over here?

1:26:57.643 --> 1:27:00.012
What are these guys doing?
Where are they going?

1:27:00.046 --> 1:27:02.314
- You see this shit, Marty?
- Well, they're in a hurry.

1:27:04.382 --> 1:27:06.418
Yo, where you guys going?

1:27:06.451 --> 1:27:08.621
Something going down
at the park?

1:27:08.654 --> 1:27:10.288
Huh?

1:27:10.322 --> 1:27:11.891
What the fuck? You got the box?

1:27:11.924 --> 1:27:13.559
- Yeah, I got the box.
- Let's go.

1:27:13.593 --> 1:27:14.827
Some shit's going down.

1:27:14.861 --> 1:27:16.562
Yo, Pop, we're going
to the park, alright?

1:27:16.596 --> 1:27:17.997
- Alright.
- Alright.

1:27:18.030 --> 1:27:20.365
- Thanks for the ride, Big Jack.
- What the fuck? Yo, hit me. Let's go.

1:27:21.701 --> 1:27:23.770
What do you think about
being back in this city, Gill?

1:27:23.803 --> 1:27:26.505
Man, I love the city, man,
and I love the kids.

1:27:26.539 --> 1:27:28.975
Yeah? You looking forward
to this season?

1:27:29.008 --> 1:27:30.576
Of course, man.

1:27:30.610 --> 1:27:33.345
- We winning everything.
- Yeah.

1:27:33.378 --> 1:27:34.412
Get that.

1:27:36.082 --> 1:27:38.517
- Yo, where are you from kid?
- Brooklyn, East 5th Street.

1:27:38.551 --> 1:27:40.887
- You on a team or something?
- Not yet.

1:27:40.920 --> 1:27:43.055
- Gonna make it to the NBA?
- Hopefully, I'll make it.

1:27:43.089 --> 1:27:45.091
Hopefully? Come on, man.

1:27:45.124 --> 1:27:46.726
Are they gonna let you run
the floor?

1:27:47.727 --> 1:27:49.829
- Peter, let me run the floor?
- Yeah.

1:27:49.862 --> 1:27:51.831
Of course, nigga. You know me.

1:27:51.864 --> 1:27:54.600
Starting point guard, baby.
You know that, easy work.

1:27:54.634 --> 1:27:56.501
- You're gonna run that floor?
- I'm running everything.

1:27:56.536 --> 1:27:57.570
I do everything, man.

1:27:57.603 --> 1:27:58.771
Can I quote you on that?

1:27:58.805 --> 1:28:01.607
Quote me on everything.
Everything.

1:28:01.641 --> 1:28:04.342
I'm tired of being fucking
the underdog, you feel me?

1:28:04.376 --> 1:28:05.611
Boy, that's Gill!

1:28:06.746 --> 1:28:08.748
Comes back to the neighborhood,
what, once a decade?

1:28:12.785 --> 1:28:14.787
- Hey, yo, Pete. What's up?
- Oh, hey.

1:28:14.821 --> 1:28:15.822
How are you?

1:28:15.855 --> 1:28:16.823
- Good to see you, man.
- What's going on?

1:28:16.856 --> 1:28:19.659
Oh, we're just, uh, finishing up
a piece on Gill.

1:28:19.692 --> 1:28:21.661
Thought it'd be a good idea to bring
him back to the old neighborhood.

1:28:21.694 --> 1:28:24.597
You gotta be kidding me, this guy
never comes back to the neighborhood.

1:28:24.630 --> 1:28:26.464
Hey, what up, Blackjack?

1:28:26.498 --> 1:28:28.366
Yo, Peter, you should get
some quotes on him.

1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:29.501
No, thanks. I'm good.

1:28:29.535 --> 1:28:31.637
Hey, you know, Finch said
you turned a lot of heads.

1:28:31.671 --> 1:28:33.940
Yeah, sorry about your tryout, man.
You seem kind of shook.

1:28:33.973 --> 1:28:34.907
Is that right?

1:28:34.941 --> 1:28:36.943
'Cause all I remember
is busting your ass.

1:28:36.976 --> 1:28:39.444
We all know why you keep
getting second chances, man?

1:28:39.477 --> 1:28:40.213
Easy, alright?

1:28:40.246 --> 1:28:41.948
- I put in the call.
- Oh, yeah?

1:28:41.981 --> 1:28:45.852
We both know lots of black ass that'll bust
Jackie's ass, but never get a second chance.

1:28:45.885 --> 1:28:46.953
Write about that, Peter.

1:28:46.986 --> 1:28:48.486
Well, I earned that tryout,
alright?

1:28:48.520 --> 1:28:49.789
You ask anyone
in this neighborhood.

1:28:49.822 --> 1:28:51.057
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1:28:51.090 --> 1:28:53.059
And I'm down here trying to be
a good example to these kids.

1:28:53.092 --> 1:28:55.895
- Come on Jack, let's go. Don't even worry about it.
- Jackie, we...

1:28:55.928 --> 1:28:58.664
- Come on, man. Was that necessary?
- Yeah, it was necessary.

1:29:05.571 --> 1:29:06.438
Go, get 'em.

1:29:08.473 --> 1:29:09.976
Hey. Yo, Gill.

1:29:10.009 --> 1:29:11.844
One-on-one, baby. Me and you.

1:29:11.878 --> 1:29:13.411
I don't play for free.

1:29:13.445 --> 1:29:15.513
Yo, this is your neighborhood.
Everyone plays for free around here, right?

1:29:15.548 --> 1:29:16.481
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1:29:16.514 --> 1:29:17.515
I will bust your ass
in front of everybody.

1:29:17.550 --> 1:29:18.516
Ball up.
Make them proud then, baby.

1:29:18.551 --> 1:29:20.753
- One on one.
- Check, let's go.

1:29:20.786 --> 1:29:22.088
- One on one...
- Ball up.

1:29:22.121 --> 1:29:22.889
- Go back there. Go ahead.
- What you're waiting for?

1:29:22.922 --> 1:29:24.123
- One on one.
- One on one.

1:29:24.156 --> 1:29:26.759
You might want to tell those
camera guys to quit, you know,

1:29:26.792 --> 1:29:28.861
you're about to get embarrassed
in front of everybody.

1:29:28.895 --> 1:29:30.196
- Come on.
- Let's fucking...

1:29:30.229 --> 1:29:31.731
- Let's go, baby.
- One on one.

1:29:36.636 --> 1:29:38.104
Hey, what's going on?

1:29:38.137 --> 1:29:41.841
Hey, your brother Jackie is playing
Gill Turner at East 5th Street Park.

1:29:41.874 --> 1:29:43.943
- What, right now?
- Yeah, right now.

1:29:43.976 --> 1:29:45.177
What the...

1:29:45.211 --> 1:29:47.813
- Are we going to finish our beers?
- No. Let's go. Come on.

1:29:47.847 --> 1:29:49.715
You ready? Alright, good.

1:29:49.749 --> 1:29:52.450
Let's go, baby.
Let's go. Come on.

1:29:52.484 --> 1:29:53.286
This is what you'll want to see?

1:29:54.820 --> 1:29:56.188
I'm about to bust
this boy ass, boy.

1:29:56.222 --> 1:29:58.724
Ball up, motherfucking asshole.
Come on, man.

1:29:58.758 --> 1:30:01.493
Come on, Gill.
Everyone's watching.

1:30:01.526 --> 1:30:02.194
Game up.

1:30:08.134 --> 1:30:09.135
That's how we do it.

1:30:14.740 --> 1:30:15.708
Let's go, Jackie.

1:30:16.943 --> 1:30:21.180
Whoa, baby!
Don't forget that ball, baby! Huh?

1:30:25.251 --> 1:30:28.220
Come on, hurry up.
That's why you are having the lead, boy.

1:30:28.254 --> 1:30:31.190
What's happening? Come on, come on.
Let's go, Jackie.

1:30:32.591 --> 1:30:36.729
all here, Jackie.
Come on, Jackie. Come on.

1:30:40.533 --> 1:30:42.168
Come on, Jackie. Come on.

1:30:42.201 --> 1:30:44.837
Come on, Jackie. Move your feet.

1:30:55.581 --> 1:30:56.782
Everybody's watching.

1:30:56.816 --> 1:30:58.985
Let's go. Come on, boy.
You got this. You got this.

1:31:01.153 --> 1:31:03.556
Come on, come on, come on.
Play fucking basketball, man.

1:31:03.589 --> 1:31:05.992
Shut the fuck up.
Come on.

1:31:18.137 --> 1:31:21.907
That's hot, baby.
That's hot right there, huh? Let's go.

1:31:23.009 --> 1:31:23.876
Let's go.

1:31:25.077 --> 1:31:25.978
Let's go.

1:31:38.257 --> 1:31:39.892
Moving out, moving out, Gill.

1:31:41.060 --> 1:31:42.561
- Whoa!
- Very nice.

1:31:44.663 --> 1:31:47.166
Jackie, you gotta play a little defense.
Come on, Jackie.

1:31:47.199 --> 1:31:49.635
Come on, show him what it's
like to be in New York. Come on.

1:31:49.668 --> 1:31:51.103
- Okay.
- It's okay, Jackie.

1:31:51.137 --> 1:31:53.072
- Come on, Jackie.
- It's okay.

1:31:57.676 --> 1:32:00.546
Let's go, baby. Let's go.

1:32:01.380 --> 1:32:03.082
What is that?
What is that?

1:32:06.952 --> 1:32:08.187
That's a foul...

1:32:08.220 --> 1:32:10.890
There's no fouls out here, guys.
We don't call fouls out here.

1:32:10.923 --> 1:32:13.692
- Give me the fucking ball, bro.
- We don't call fouls out here, baby.

1:32:13.726 --> 1:32:15.027
- Give me the ball, bro.
- We don't call fouls.

1:32:15.061 --> 1:32:16.495
Yo, you fouled me.

1:32:16.529 --> 1:32:19.632
- Do we call fouls out here?
- Yeah, fucker, we do call fouls.

1:32:19.665 --> 1:32:20.599
You gotta be bleeding, baby.

1:32:20.633 --> 1:32:22.701
So, what's up, bro?
What you trying to do?

1:32:22.735 --> 1:32:24.937
What you trying to fucking do, man?
Get the fuck outta here, man.

1:32:24.970 --> 1:32:26.305
Get the fuck outta here, man.

1:32:30.242 --> 1:32:32.311
You can't hold me, man.
You can't hold me.

1:32:32.344 --> 1:32:35.081
Too many weapons, baby.
Too many weapons. Let's just go.

1:32:35.114 --> 1:32:36.148
Come on, Jackie.

1:32:49.862 --> 1:32:51.730
Right, Jackie. Come on.

1:33:02.842 --> 1:33:05.077
- Check the ball, baby. Let's go.
- Give me the fucking ball.

1:33:14.120 --> 1:33:15.654
Okay.

1:33:20.059 --> 1:33:21.861
- Ooh.
- Okay.

1:33:26.699 --> 1:33:29.168
Yeah, I know.
I know you going to do that.

1:33:31.470 --> 1:33:34.640
Quit playing on me, man.
Come on.

1:33:41.080 --> 1:33:41.947
Point game.

1:33:48.487 --> 1:33:51.257
All that talk. You can't hit it, huh?
All that talk.

1:33:51.290 --> 1:33:54.426
Score, 10-9. I'm up, baby.
I see what you trying to do.

1:33:54.460 --> 1:33:55.728
Guard the fuck up.

1:34:08.207 --> 1:34:10.409
Jackie, game point.
You got this.

1:34:10.442 --> 1:34:12.144
Game point, baby.

1:34:12.178 --> 1:34:13.245
This is it.

1:34:41.006 --> 1:34:42.241
I would have gone more left.

1:34:42.274 --> 1:34:44.176
Of course, you would have.

1:34:44.210 --> 1:34:45.077
Mm-hm.

1:34:47.246 --> 1:34:48.247
I love you.

1:34:50.449 --> 1:34:52.051
Hmm, I love you.

1:34:59.792 --> 1:35:01.894
- You wanna get outta here?
- Yeah.
