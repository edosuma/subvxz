WEBVTT

00:00.019 --> 00:04.258
What do you reckon? Yeah. It's good.
It's pretty hardcore?

00:04.259 --> 00:05.999
It is hardcore but it's also classy.

00:06.065 --> 00:08.345
Classy. Yeah.

00:08.385 --> 00:10.545
- Is that a gangbang?
- No, that's a threesome.

00:10.585 --> 00:13.985
Two guys can't be a gang? They're
definitely ganging up on her.

00:14.025 --> 00:16.985
Yeah, but she's cool with it.
She's smiling. Look. Oh, yeah.

00:17.025 --> 00:19.745
Grumio, how many times do I have to
ask you to empty the bin?

00:19.785 --> 00:23.185
- I squashed it down instead.
- Oh. Fine then!

00:23.225 --> 00:26.145
And now you're looking at porn.
First class slaving!

00:26.185 --> 00:29.945
Er, this is not porn. This is
vintage erotica. For his birthday.

00:29.985 --> 00:31.945
Of course. One of those
thoughtful gifts

00:31.985 --> 00:33.865
that was clearly bought
for yourself.

00:33.905 --> 00:37.505
No. It's for him. What? Even though
he's never expressed any interest

00:37.545 --> 00:39.465
in pottery, porn or, well, anything.

00:39.505 --> 00:42.305
Oh, ay'up. Look at her.
Who does that remind you of?

00:42.345 --> 00:44.865
Erm... Give me a clue. Cynthia.

00:44.905 --> 00:47.345
- OK. That's quite a big clue.
- What? Let me see.

00:48.225 --> 00:51.185
Nope. I can't see how
you're getting Cynthia from...

00:51.225 --> 00:53.105
Oh, wait. Hang on. Oh, wow. Yeah!
Got it.

00:53.145 --> 00:56.109
- This gift just keeps on giving.
- Looks nothing like her.

00:56.235 --> 00:59.090
- It does from a certain angle.
- Where? What angle?

00:59.585 --> 01:02.585
Hey. What you up to? Not much.
Nothing. Just got a new vase.

01:02.625 --> 01:04.305
OK.

01:04.345 --> 01:07.145
What are you doing later?
Um, can't quite hear you.

01:07.185 --> 01:09.785
No, don't come in.
We've just mopped. Oh, sorry.

01:09.825 --> 01:12.785
No, we haven't. What are you -
Just lean. Oh, come on.

01:12.825 --> 01:16.425
Lean in. Stop it. I was just seeing
if - Still can't hear you. Sorry.

01:16.465 --> 01:18.825
Just lean in a tiny bit more,
like, an inch.

01:18.865 --> 01:20.905
Just a tiny bit... There! Stop there.

01:21.825 --> 01:24.705
Now we can hear you. I was wondering
if you had plans tonight.

01:24.745 --> 01:27.025
His cousin's in town.
We're meeting at the bar.

01:27.065 --> 01:29.585
You should definitely come.
Coolio. See you there.

01:29.625 --> 01:32.065
You saw that, right?
I take it back. It's a great gift.

01:49.905 --> 01:52.105
So, how old
are you going to be tomorrow?

01:52.145 --> 01:54.385
Dunno. You don't know?

01:54.425 --> 01:58.625
When his parents got me, no-one knew
my age, so I just started again.

01:58.665 --> 02:01.105
I could be anywhere
between 18 and 45.

02:01.145 --> 02:04.985
Wow. You have incredible skin
for a 45-year-old. Cheers.

02:05.025 --> 02:07.025
Right. Everyone grab one of these.

02:07.065 --> 02:09.465
Top shelf challenge?
Top shelf challenge.

02:09.505 --> 02:11.425
What's that? Family tradition.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.385
One shot from each bottle on
the top shelf

02:13.425 --> 02:16.185
which, in this place, includes
vinegar and brass polish.

02:16.225 --> 02:17.985
So, pick wisely.

02:18.025 --> 02:20.265
I want a drink.
I don't want a challenge.

02:20.305 --> 02:22.025
You need to loosen up, Marky boy.

02:22.065 --> 02:25.105
Starting with this tunic.
Oi, don't touch it. It's expensive.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.705
How? There's hardly any material.
It's deliberately skinny.

02:28.745 --> 02:31.065
It's anorexic, mate.
I can see the lot.

02:31.105 --> 02:33.465
That look is very in right now.

02:33.505 --> 02:36.065
I think it suits you.
Thanks very much.

02:36.185 --> 02:38.065
Got you a birthday cocktail, Gru.

02:38.105 --> 02:39.785
Happy birthday.

02:39.825 --> 02:42.145
What have you got him
for his birthday, Marcus?

02:42.185 --> 02:44.185
Ah. Erm - He's not got me anything.

02:44.225 --> 02:46.105
What? Why? Seriously?

02:46.145 --> 02:47.865
Well, no -
He says I don't deserve it.

02:47.905 --> 02:51.545
That's cold. I didn't say that.
That was a joke, Grumio.

02:51.585 --> 02:54.705
Course he deserves it.
Being a slave is really hard work.

02:54.745 --> 02:56.585
I know. I'd like to see you do that.

02:56.625 --> 02:59.585
Well, that is exactly why
I have got him what I've got him.

02:59.625 --> 03:01.625
What have you got him?

03:01.665 --> 03:06.105
Well, erm, tomorrow,
I'm gonna... er...

03:06.145 --> 03:08.265
I'm gonna be his slave.

03:08.305 --> 03:10.465
For the day.
And you'll be my master.

03:10.505 --> 03:13.345
Because, as you say,
they work so hard.

03:13.385 --> 03:15.385
And it is very easy to forget that.

03:16.345 --> 03:19.265
Wow. What a truly amazing gift. Yeah.

03:19.305 --> 03:21.945
I'd rather have a cake.
I think that is so impressive.

03:21.985 --> 03:25.825
Yeah, it is. In fact, everyone,
I would like to propose a toast.

03:25.865 --> 03:29.265
To my tireless slave,
but above all... friend.

03:30.145 --> 03:33.065
Grumio! Me.

03:35.985 --> 03:37.705
OK, that's the polish.

04:14.705 --> 04:16.704
Happy birthday. Cheers.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.505
Is that my vase?
Yea - Mmm?

04:21.144 --> 04:24.065
Why were you in the bog with it?
Er... I was just trying it out.

04:24.105 --> 04:27.465
Seeing what it would look like
in there. Did it look like Cynthia?

04:27.505 --> 04:29.505
I didn't check.

04:32.585 --> 04:34.905
Morning, all. Happy birthday, G-man.

04:34.945 --> 04:37.305
Yeah. Ta.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.825
Hang on. Is this a walk of shame?
Walk of pride, mate.

04:39.865 --> 04:41.745
Who was it?
Agentleman never tells.

04:41.785 --> 04:43.825
Was it a gentleman?
Which gentleman was it?

04:43.865 --> 04:45.745
OK, piss off. It was a girl.
What girl?

04:45.785 --> 04:48.625
Was she in the bar?
Yes, she was with us... Sort of.

04:48.665 --> 04:50.585
You shagged Cynthia?
You couldn't not.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.585
Whoa, calm down.
I didn't shag Cynthia.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.905
Right, so - Metella?
Bloody hell. That's brave.

04:54.945 --> 04:56.945
Not Metella.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.585
Totally nailed Lucretia. Yeow.

04:59.625 --> 05:01.905
Go get em, tiger. Boom.

05:01.945 --> 05:04.185
Sorry. No, hang on.
You shagged your cousin?

05:04.225 --> 05:07.065
Yeah. It's no biggie.
I'm pretty sure it is a biggie.

05:07.105 --> 05:08.945
Incest is one of
the biggest biggies.

05:08.985 --> 05:11.625
Does that count? You're related.
Your mums are sisters.

05:11.665 --> 05:14.505
But they're not close.
Oh, well, if they're not close...

05:14.545 --> 05:17.305
I mean, this is so big
I have no idea where to even start.

05:17.345 --> 05:19.705
That's what she said.
Did she? Did she say that?

05:19.745 --> 05:22.625
Or did she say, 'What the hell
are you doing? We're related?

05:22.665 --> 05:24.705
She's never had a problem with it.

05:24.745 --> 05:26.905
You've done this before?
Yeah. On occasion.

05:26.945 --> 05:29.785
How many occasions?
I don't know. 10? 12?

05:30.665 --> 05:33.745
A dozen? You've shagged your cousin
a dozen times?

05:33.785 --> 05:35.785
A cousin's dozen.
A cousin's dozen.

05:36.305 --> 05:38.745
When was the first?
Er... Her mum's 50th.

05:38.785 --> 05:41.385
We got wasted. It was really boring
and, you know...

05:41.425 --> 05:43.625
No! No, I do not know.

05:43.665 --> 05:46.105
When my family get together
they get drunk and argue.

05:46.145 --> 05:49.025
Last summer, I helped my cousin
Antonia pick up seashells.

05:49.065 --> 05:51.185
What I did not do was fuck her.

05:51.225 --> 05:53.825
I mean... this is depraved.
Even for you.

05:53.865 --> 05:56.585
Bullshit. It's not depraved.
The royal family always do it.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.505
The royal family are mental.

05:58.545 --> 06:01.465
In fact, that's why they're mental.
They're incest-y sickos.

06:01.505 --> 06:03.345
You've got this one wrong, mate.

06:03.385 --> 06:06.865
As the tight tunic proves, you're
out of touch with what people think.

06:06.905 --> 06:08.745
What about you, Grumio?
Yeah, it's OK.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.505
Don't ask him. He won't know.
He once put his dick in a melon.

06:11.545 --> 06:14.465
Yeah, why did you do that?
I weren't hungry.

06:14.505 --> 06:16.945
Ask around.
You will find this is not cool.

06:16.985 --> 06:19.345
OK, Captain high horse.
I'll ask around.

06:19.385 --> 06:22.065
But answer me this -
which one of us got laid last night?

06:22.105 --> 06:25.065
Well, my family
were all out of town, so - I did.

06:25.105 --> 06:27.025
So, I win, baby. I win.

06:27.065 --> 06:29.065
Argh. Not on the tunic.

06:32.785 --> 06:35.065
Oh, hey! Great night last night.

06:35.105 --> 06:37.705
I love your cousin.
Yeah, I know. Me, too.

06:41.865 --> 06:44.985
That's amazing. I made it myself.
Ah, cheers.

06:45.025 --> 06:47.785
Sort of.
Well, Metella did the baking bit.

06:47.825 --> 06:49.785
What did you do? I did the icing.

06:49.825 --> 06:51.825
I meant to put Grumio
but I ran out of space.

06:51.865 --> 06:54.425
My fault for not making a big enough
cake, apparently.

06:54.465 --> 06:56.865
Let's not get into that again.
We're both to blame.

06:56.905 --> 06:59.465
So, how's the swap going?

06:59.505 --> 07:01.345
Yes. It's going well.
Isn't it, Grumio?

07:01.385 --> 07:03.345
What? What is? The job swap.

07:03.385 --> 07:06.145
That we've done.
With you being the master.

07:06.185 --> 07:08.145
Oh, no. Can't be arsed with that.

07:08.185 --> 07:09.825
That's a shame.

07:09.865 --> 07:13.945
You don't have to do anything.
Just sit there with your feet up.

07:13.985 --> 07:16.985
He's doing that already.
Exactly. It's pointless, innit?

07:17.025 --> 07:19.905
He's not quite got the hang
of it yet. Who wants some cake?

07:19.945 --> 07:22.065
Master? Some cake for you?

07:22.105 --> 07:25.585
I will, please. Just a slither.
Right you are. A tiny slither.

07:25.625 --> 07:27.865
Also, Marcus.
Not a criticism but acting wise,

07:27.905 --> 07:29.665
it might be a bit more realistic

07:29.705 --> 07:32.825
if your slave character
is a bit more sad and hunchy.

07:32.865 --> 07:35.265
Sad and hunchy? Erm... Hmm?

07:36.665 --> 07:38.545
Yeah, nailed it.

07:38.585 --> 07:41.705
And if you want to be imperious,
Grumio. Can you be imperious?

07:41.745 --> 07:45.665
No, I can't. One - I don't know what
it means. Two - I'm not playing.

07:45.705 --> 07:47.825
Come on, Grumio. It's fun, mate.

07:47.865 --> 07:51.305
Why not get your slave
to clean the toilet, Grumio?

07:51.345 --> 07:55.065
Nah, toilet's fine.
Blokes can just piss it clean.

07:55.105 --> 07:56.785
Oh, dear. I'll give it a wipe later.

07:56.825 --> 07:58.985
So, there's nothing you want?
Nothing at all?

07:59.025 --> 08:01.705
Go on, Grumio.
He'll do anything you say.

08:01.745 --> 08:04.505
- Anything?
- Er... Well...

08:06.065 --> 08:08.505
- ...yeah.
- Fine.

08:08.545 --> 08:10.145
Game on.

08:10.185 --> 08:12.185
Oh... Fantastic!

08:17.545 --> 08:19.545
Oi! Put that back.

08:20.065 --> 08:24.265
H-How do I do that? Don't move
and keep dripping. That's mine.

08:24.305 --> 08:26.465
It's rainwater.
I don't give a shit, mate.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.425
It's my bucket. You owe me for that.

08:28.465 --> 08:30.465
Fine.

08:30.905 --> 08:33.745
Landlord? Can I ask you
a personal question? Go on.

08:33.784 --> 08:37.065
Right. Do you think it's OK
to make love to your cousin?

08:38.025 --> 08:40.145
Good question.

08:40.184 --> 08:42.424
What level of cousin are we talking?
First.

08:42.465 --> 08:46.345
The top floor. OK. Now, see,
this is not a problem I have

08:46.385 --> 08:50.065
because my cousin Nigella's been
very much beaten with the ugly club.

08:50.105 --> 08:53.225
It's an ugly stick.
In her case it was a club.

08:53.265 --> 08:56.225
I shouldn't really joke.
She is genuinely very unhappy.

08:56.265 --> 08:58.305
On the flip side,
I've got a mate Hector

08:58.345 --> 09:00.345
whose cousin is an absolute stunner.

09:00.385 --> 09:02.905
If I was him, I would be in there
like a rat up a drainpipe.

09:02.945 --> 09:06.865
So, what you're basically saying is
it depends on what she looks like?

09:06.905 --> 09:09.265
Very much so. Does that help?

09:09.305 --> 09:11.665
Er... Sort of. Yeah, cheers.

09:15.705 --> 09:17.485
No. That is not part of the game.

09:17.525 --> 09:18.918
You said anything.

09:19.144 --> 09:22.224
Yeah, I meant anything in terms of abstract tasks.
Not personal accouchements.

09:23.705 --> 09:27.625
I'm giving you my time and energy.
Not my actual belongings.

09:27.665 --> 09:31.265
What the fuck you talking about?
You'll get it dirty. You're dirty.

09:31.305 --> 09:34.105
Oh, I see. And, you know, Cynthia
kind of likes me in it, so...

09:34.145 --> 09:35.905
I'm not bothered.

09:35.945 --> 09:38.625
You're my slave, you do as I say.
That's the game, innit?

09:38.665 --> 09:40.505
You're just trying to annoy me.

09:40.545 --> 09:43.705
Should've thought about that when
you give me this shitty gift.

09:43.745 --> 09:45.385
Now take off your bastard tunic.

09:45.425 --> 09:47.425
Please, Grumio. I'll buy you a hat.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.865
- What kind of hat?
- Pointy.

09:50.505 --> 09:54.065
- No, not pointy. Smooth. Any hat.
- I want your tunic.

09:54.105 --> 09:56.425
No! Categorically, no.

09:56.465 --> 10:00.305
Or, I'll tell Cynthia what you've
been getting up to in the bog.

10:00.345 --> 10:02.065
With the vase.

10:02.105 --> 10:04.305
At a certain angle.

10:04.345 --> 10:06.545
I'm sure she'll be
very impressed with that.

10:06.585 --> 10:09.225
- You wouldn't dare.
- Just you try me.

10:19.505 --> 10:21.865
Oh, yes. That's much more slave-y.

10:21.905 --> 10:24.025
Ha ha. Yeah, thanks. I thought so.

10:24.745 --> 10:26.745
Keep up the hunching.

10:31.985 --> 10:34.985
Eurgh, no. 1000% no. Gross.

10:36.163 --> 10:38.763
Hang on. Has one of you
humped your cousin?

10:38.796 --> 10:41.556
- Well, no. In theory.
- Oh, my God. Who was it?

10:41.596 --> 10:44.756
- Well, who knows?
- OK. I do. It was clearly you.

10:44.796 --> 10:46.036
- Yeah, it was him.
- You weren't meant to say!

10:46.076 --> 10:48.356
Marcus would never do
something like that. Correct.

10:48.396 --> 10:51.036
- Like he ever has sex with anyone.
- Er, no. That's not why.

10:51.076 --> 10:53.736
You're a dirty perv.
So, it's right up your horrid alley.

10:53.828 --> 10:55.508
I don't care what you think, mate.

10:55.548 --> 10:57.388
She's hot as shit, so it's fine.

10:57.428 --> 11:00.068
- Really? What does she look like?
- Tall, dark, curly.

11:00.108 --> 11:02.828
- Exactly like him, basically.
- Oh, wow. This gets better.

11:02.868 --> 11:04.588
You're knobbing your cousin

11:04.628 --> 11:07.508
cos it's the closest you can get
to having sex with yourself.

11:07.548 --> 11:11.108
You may as well bore a hole in a
mirror and shag that. That'll do.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.595
Shall I take the piss out of that
sack you're wearing instead, Marcus?

11:13.621 --> 11:15.788
Oh, no. Go back to him.

11:15.828 --> 11:19.028
Dirty, dirty, dirty dick.
You've got a dirty dick.

11:19.068 --> 11:21.308
Eurgh! Gross. Dirty cousin fucker.

11:23.268 --> 11:25.788
You've got a dirty dick
on the end of your dick.

11:32.348 --> 11:34.308
Yeow. Great night.

11:34.348 --> 11:37.108
Ah, man. It got proper messy
in the end there.

11:37.148 --> 11:40.388
We've gotta stop doing that.
Yeah, really? You think? Hell yeah.

11:40.428 --> 11:43.348
Who dances on bars? We're such dicks.

11:43.388 --> 11:46.748
Oh, yeah. I thought you were talking
about the whole us shagging thing.

11:46.788 --> 11:48.548
What? Hey, we were on fire, cous.

11:48.588 --> 11:51.668
If there'd been an audience,
we would've got a standing ovation.

11:51.708 --> 11:54.548
You see, I'm not sure we would.
OK, normal ovation.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.588
Or maybe even booing.

11:57.068 --> 11:59.868
What? What are you talking about?

11:59.908 --> 12:03.588
I've told a few people about what
we do and they reckon it's... iffy.

12:03.628 --> 12:06.588
That is horse shit.
What is iffy about it?

12:06.628 --> 12:09.908
I'm a girl. You're a boy.
Yeah, but also... cousins.

12:09.948 --> 12:12.148
We're close. So what?
There's close...

12:12.188 --> 12:15.308
and then there's so close that
you're kind of inside each other.

12:15.348 --> 12:17.508
Who cares what other people say, Sty?

12:17.548 --> 12:20.388
It's private and it's awesome,
so chill the fuck out.

12:20.428 --> 12:23.108
It's not like we're getting married
or anything.

12:23.148 --> 12:25.468
Yeah. Fair point.

12:25.508 --> 12:28.228
Although, meeting your family
would be a breeze.

12:45.668 --> 12:47.748
Salve, Grumio. All right, Landlord.

12:47.788 --> 12:50.788
That's a snazzy tunic.
Is your master in? He owes me money?

12:50.828 --> 12:53.708
No, he's at work,
but I'm master today as it goes.

12:53.748 --> 12:57.628
Oh, well. In that case,
you owe me money. Fair dos.

12:57.668 --> 13:00.348
Do you want some cake, by the way?
It's my birthday.

13:00.388 --> 13:03.628
Oh, really? Well, many happy returns.
Whatever that means.

13:03.668 --> 13:05.508
Yeah, I could murder some cake.

13:05.548 --> 13:07.668
Whoa! What is this?

13:07.708 --> 13:11.148
This is not part of the original
furnishings, as I recall.

13:11.188 --> 13:13.588
That's vintage erotica. Lovely.

13:13.628 --> 13:17.348
Oh, look at them go.
That really is fabulous.

13:17.388 --> 13:20.268
Yep. Yeah, I actually
make that face as it goes.

13:20.788 --> 13:25.988
That very much is the face I make
when I'm doing... what he's doing.

13:26.028 --> 13:27.868
There's a girl on the other side

13:27.908 --> 13:31.668
that looks like Cynthia from next
door. From a certain angle.

13:31.708 --> 13:34.788
Really?
How'd you get - Ohhh, yep. Got it.

13:34.828 --> 13:37.388
OK, yeah. Ohhh, can I borrow this?

13:37.428 --> 13:41.548
Borrow? Yeah. I'm just toying with
the idea of getting a vase myself.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.628
So, I could really do with seeing
what it looks like in my place.

13:44.668 --> 13:48.268
How long's that gonna take?
Oh, 10, 15 minutes should be fine.

13:53.148 --> 13:55.348
OK. Fire away.

13:55.388 --> 13:58.108
I hereby call the first meeting

13:58.148 --> 14:00.228
of the office Incest Society.

14:00.268 --> 14:02.988
Oh, fantastic. Count me in. Really?

14:03.028 --> 14:05.628
Of course. I've been hooked
since I was a wee lad.

14:05.668 --> 14:07.548
I used to collect butterflies.

14:07.588 --> 14:10.228
I once owned a purple emperor,
if you can believe that.

14:10.268 --> 14:12.148
Oh, no. Sorry.

14:12.188 --> 14:14.548
Incest. Ah.

14:14.588 --> 14:17.588
Right. No, I didn't do that.

14:18.188 --> 14:24.348
So, if you just put down 'anyone who
enjoys relations with relations

14:24.388 --> 14:26.988
should come for a drink
and a chat after work.'

14:27.028 --> 14:28.908
Got it. Can I still count you in?

14:28.948 --> 14:32.468
I'm meant to be meeting my mother
this evening. Bring her along.

14:37.708 --> 14:40.708
♪ My name is Stylax,
I'm into weird sex

14:40.748 --> 14:43.788
♪ I shag my granny in her fanny

14:43.828 --> 14:46.988
♪ I kiss my brother,
I fuck my mother

14:47.028 --> 14:49.628
♪ And all my uncles, in the... ♪

14:52.468 --> 14:55.028
What a life you lead, Waterboy.
Waterman.

14:55.068 --> 14:57.508
I was doing him.
Sounds like you were doing everyone.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.308
You missed the beginning. Lucky me.

14:59.348 --> 15:02.308
Change your tunic, Copier?
Sorry. It's just for today.

15:02.348 --> 15:05.788
No, no. It's very you.
It's functional and drab.

15:05.828 --> 15:08.188
Shredder, darling?
Quick word in my office. Yep.

15:14.908 --> 15:17.868
Sorry if it's inappropriate
or something. Don't be.

15:17.908 --> 15:20.148
I fully approve. Really?

15:20.188 --> 15:23.228
As you might suspect, my family are
both gorgeous and liberal.

15:23.268 --> 15:25.708
So, I have, of course,
climbed the family tree,

15:25.748 --> 15:30.028
swung from its branches
and sampled its fruit and/or nuts.

15:30.068 --> 15:32.308
Right. So, you're pro...

15:32.348 --> 15:34.108
An old pro, yeah.

15:34.148 --> 15:37.148
And I believe that society
has no right to judge.

15:37.708 --> 15:39.588
Each to their own, I say.

15:39.628 --> 15:42.388
Mmm, I guess
that's how incest works.

15:42.428 --> 15:47.788
Was your one with a cousin? My
one... was more of a three, actually.

15:47.828 --> 15:50.188
My first affair
was with an uncle when I was 17.

15:50.228 --> 15:54.948
He was extremely generous
as a lover, teacher and chef.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.908
The second was with a first cousin

15:56.948 --> 15:59.068
and the third was with
a second cousin.

16:00.868 --> 16:04.068
I salute you, Shredder.
You're doing a noble thing.

16:05.948 --> 16:10.068
I'm doing a terrible thing. Yes,
I know. I've been telling you that.

16:10.108 --> 16:11.988
What changed your mind? Flavia.

16:12.028 --> 16:14.868
What? She told you off?
No, she told me on. She loves it.

16:14.908 --> 16:16.988
And she's a bloody deviant.

16:17.028 --> 16:20.108
I mean, she takes baths in arse milk,
for fuck's sake.

16:20.148 --> 16:23.028
Pretty sure that's ass's milk
rather than arse milk.

16:23.068 --> 16:26.068
Yeah, that makes sense.
I was wondering how you milk an arse.

16:26.108 --> 16:29.428
What you gonna do? I'm gonna
have to dump my cousin, aren't I?

16:29.468 --> 16:32.548
Brilliant. As if family holidays
weren't awkward enough.

16:40.868 --> 16:43.868
Hey, Marcus.
Give this back to your master.

16:43.908 --> 16:46.988
Erm, sorry. Why have you got it?
Just having a go on it.

16:47.028 --> 16:51.028
What? From a certain angle, one of the girls
looks I know. I know about the angle.

16:51.068 --> 16:53.948
All right, chill out. Tell Grumio
I meant to return it earlier,

16:53.988 --> 16:56.308
only I was trying
it out in different rooms.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.308
Yeah, I bet you were. Oh, look...

16:58.348 --> 17:00.348
missed a spot.

17:02.028 --> 17:07.068
Grumio? Do not lend Landlord the vase
to wank over. Hey! Hello!

17:07.108 --> 17:10.428
What are you doing here?
Come and have a look at Grumio. OK.

17:10.468 --> 17:12.468
I mean, I have seen him before but...

17:14.828 --> 17:16.948
All right? Doesn't he look amazing?

17:18.468 --> 17:20.228
Yeah, that is... great.

17:20.268 --> 17:22.828
Just stop a sec, please, mate.
How much is this costing?

17:22.867 --> 17:25.708
Oh. Don't worry about that, slave.
It's my money now.

17:25.748 --> 17:27.548
And Franco's worth every penny.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.508
Glad to hear it. Carry on, Franco.

17:30.548 --> 17:33.388
Just watch the tunic
would you, please, Franco?

17:33.428 --> 17:35.428
What's for my tea?

17:35.468 --> 17:38.948
Well, we've got potatoes
and eggs and - I want a goose.

17:40.108 --> 17:42.628
We're not having a goose.
Master's asked for a goose.

17:42.668 --> 17:45.748
Yes, but - What were that you said
about lending Landlord the vase?

17:45.788 --> 17:48.508
Let's have a goose, in fact! Why not?

17:48.548 --> 17:50.388
Groovy. Do you wanna goose, Cynth?

17:50.428 --> 17:53.788
Do you? No, thanks. There's still
some cake left.

17:53.828 --> 17:56.668
Franco? Goose? OK.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.348
Two gooses.

17:58.388 --> 18:00.388
Hmmm.

18:01.108 --> 18:03.108
It's not you. It's me.

18:03.148 --> 18:05.308
In fact, it's not me. It's us.

18:06.428 --> 18:08.348
It's our grandparents being the same.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.028
I know. It's so weird.

18:10.068 --> 18:13.748
People were properly judge-y when I
spoke to them about it. I know, right.

18:13.788 --> 18:15.748
Maybe we're just ahead of our time.

18:15.788 --> 18:19.268
Or behind our time.
Mmm. So, are we ending it then?

18:19.308 --> 18:20.908
The incest bit? Yeah.

18:20.948 --> 18:25.108
But we're still going to be friends,
right? Hell yeah. More than friends.

18:25.148 --> 18:27.548
Exactly. It's not like
we won't see each other again.

18:27.588 --> 18:30.028
We're all going
to Auntie Augustus this summer

18:30.068 --> 18:33.228
which is now going to be boring as
shit without the shagging.

18:33.268 --> 18:37.228
Yeah, we'll have to do a
crappy treasure hunt, eh? Yeah.

18:37.268 --> 18:39.268
Come here, Cous.

18:43.988 --> 18:46.068
And release.

19:01.108 --> 19:04.748
Dinner time then, you curly twat.
Hurry up. I'm starving.

19:04.788 --> 19:06.908
Where's Franco?
Oh, he couldn't wait for you.

19:06.948 --> 19:09.908
So, what do I do with this goose?
Whatever. Release it.

19:09.948 --> 19:11.948
Release it? OK, brilliant.

19:12.668 --> 19:16.468
Off you go then, mate. You're free.
Oi, that's not a goose.

19:16.508 --> 19:19.788
Yes, it is. Goose have got long
bendy necks. That's a shit goose.

19:19.828 --> 19:21.628
No it's not a - Do you mean a swan?

19:21.668 --> 19:23.988
That's it. I want one of them
arrogant pricks.

19:24.028 --> 19:26.268
- They don't sell swans.
- Go and catch one then.

19:26.308 --> 19:28.508
What...? Hang on.
What's that on my tunic?

19:28.548 --> 19:30.348
Is that dye? Have you dyed my tunic?

19:30.388 --> 19:33.988
- That's from where I got my highlights done.
- That's it. Game over. Take it off.

19:34.028 --> 19:36.268
No, I'm the boss.
Not any more you're not.

19:36.308 --> 19:38.948
We're stopping this.
I'll tell her about the vase.

19:38.988 --> 19:40.988
Cynthia!
Get that bloody tunic off, now!

19:41.028 --> 19:43.068
Maybe I'll show her the angle.
Cynthia!

19:43.108 --> 19:45.108
You can't prove anything.

19:46.748 --> 19:48.788
Give it back. Give it back. Cynthia!

19:51.468 --> 19:53.548
You... big bastard.

19:53.588 --> 19:57.308
- Oops.
- You want oops? I'll give you oops.

19:58.748 --> 20:00.748
No, no, no.

20:01.148 --> 20:03.268
Sto - I'm eating the cake all wrong.

20:03.308 --> 20:05.788
Oh, no. Stop, stop it!
That's worth more than you are.

20:05.828 --> 20:09.788
You couldn't be arsed to get me a birthday
present, so I know you think that.

20:09.828 --> 20:12.668
Right. It's mess you want, is it?
I'll give you mess.

20:16.708 --> 20:19.268
You pissing yourself?
It's your tunic.

20:19.308 --> 20:22.388
So, technically,
I'm pissing yourself. Ahhh.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.108
It's like that, is it?
It is, actually.

20:26.948 --> 20:29.708
What are you doing?

20:29.748 --> 20:32.108
I'm upping the ante.
Grumio, stop it. Seriously.

20:32.788 --> 20:35.108
And touchdown.

20:35.148 --> 20:38.188
Have I got any more where that came
from? No, don't. Yep, we do.

20:38.228 --> 20:40.708
Stop it!

20:44.188 --> 20:47.148
Have you pissed and shitted
yourself?

20:47.548 --> 20:49.548
Shat? Yeah.

20:52.028 --> 20:54.028
And Stylax had sex with his cousin.

21:05.748 --> 21:07.748
Ah, thanks for fixing it.

21:08.508 --> 21:10.948
Can't quite find the angle
anymore, though. Ah, well.

21:10.988 --> 21:13.668
I got stains out your tunic,
by the way. Oh. Thanks, man.

21:13.708 --> 21:15.708
It took ages. It were dead soiled.

21:16.708 --> 21:18.708
Sorry about the soil. It's fine.

21:21.348 --> 21:24.388
Shrunk a bit.
Yeah. Might be too skinny now.

21:24.428 --> 21:26.988
Yeah. And it stinks of shit.

21:40.588 --> 21:42.588
Go on, go on. You can do it!
