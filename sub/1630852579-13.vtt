NARRATOR: Prehistoric
rock art depicting astronauts.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.258
Oh, look at that.

00:06.381 --> 00:07.721
-LUCA GIARELLI: The spaceman?
-The spaceman!

00:07.799 --> 00:09.219
Exactly! Look at the helmet.

00:09.301 --> 00:10.891
NARRATOR:
An ancient temple

00:11.011 --> 00:13.431
covered
in otherworldly writings.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.015
It’s all here,
in this sanctuary,

00:16.099 --> 00:19.639
the whole story of
humanity’s place in the stars.

00:19.728 --> 00:24.318
NARRATOR:
Incredible petroglyphs
of mysterious flying objects.

00:24.399 --> 00:27.319
So this one here
looks like a UFO.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.452
NARRATOR:
For more than a decade,

00:29.571 --> 00:31.361
<i>Ancient Aliens</i> has examined

00:31.448 --> 00:34.908
the oldest and most
mysterious carvings on Earth

00:34.993 --> 00:37.413
up close and in person.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.908
Now we take a look back

00:40.040 --> 00:42.630
at some of
the most extraordinary glyphs.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.921
Glyphs, that according to
ancient astronaut theorists,

00:46.046 --> 00:50.836
tell a worldwide
story of alien visitation.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.718
♪ ♪

01:06.942 --> 01:10.612
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i> we have
traveled across the world

01:10.737 --> 01:13.817
examining some of the most
mysterious stone carvings,

01:13.949 --> 01:16.239
often referred to as glyphs.

01:16.326 --> 01:20.996
Our ancestors spent countless
hours carving images and symbols

01:21.123 --> 01:23.833
as a record
of what they thought were

01:23.959 --> 01:26.839
the most important
pieces of their history.

01:26.962 --> 01:30.972
Many glyphs depict strange,
humanoid figures,

01:31.049 --> 01:35.299
and tell stories of visitors
coming down from the sky.

01:36.305 --> 01:39.565
William Henry got to see
some of these incredible glyphs

01:39.641 --> 01:43.271
up close in
the mountains of northern Italy.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.311
NARRATOR:
Val Camonica, Italy.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.730
June 13, 2019.

01:49.818 --> 01:53.358
Ancient astronaut
theorist William Henry

01:53.488 --> 01:56.278
has traveled to this
UNESCO world heritage site

01:56.366 --> 01:58.826
to investigate what he believes

01:58.910 --> 02:02.160
could be forensic evidence
that the early civilizations

02:02.289 --> 02:06.169
of this region came into
contact with extraterrestrials.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.673
Hi, I’m William.
Nice to meet you.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.625
NARRATOR:
Joining him is Luca Giarelli,

02:11.715 --> 02:14.555
the head
of the Val Camonica Historical

02:14.676 --> 02:16.546
and Anthropological Society.

02:16.678 --> 02:20.008
Luca has spent years
studying this mysterious region

02:20.098 --> 02:24.188
of northern Italy and wants to
show William the rock carvings

02:24.269 --> 02:27.149
for which this
alpine valley is famous.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.320
This place is massive.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.657
I’m ready, let’s go.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.408
HENRY:
I’m here at
Val Camonica because it is

02:42.537 --> 02:45.867
a treasure trove of images
from the ancient world that have

02:45.999 --> 02:48.209
been well-documented
and studied by scholars.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.675
They don’t agree on the meaning
of the images but some of them

02:51.755 --> 02:54.975
are very openminded
to the ancient astronaut theory.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.476
Footprints. Wow!

03:08.188 --> 03:09.808
Look like deer.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.401
Look at this, incredible.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.084
Wow.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.924
HENRY:
Oh, look at that.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.462
The spaceman, exactly.
Look at the helmet!

03:33.588 --> 03:36.218
Right. It’s like he’s glowing.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.219
The Camunian Rose.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.945
Wow.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.858
19 Camunian Roses?

03:57.946 --> 04:00.946
NARRATOR:
Archaeologists call this

04:01.032 --> 04:03.452
mysterious symbol
the Camunian Rose

04:03.535 --> 04:06.005
because of
its flower-like shape.

04:06.121 --> 04:09.211
While its exact meaning
is lost to history,

04:09.291 --> 04:11.421
some believe
it to be a religious symbol

04:11.501 --> 04:15.671
or a representation of
the movement of the stars.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.927
But ancient astronaut
theorists suggest it might

04:19.009 --> 04:21.179
also depict something else...

04:21.303 --> 04:23.393
the vessel
that brought these helmeted

04:23.472 --> 04:26.642
figures to Val Camonica.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.387
Look at that.
That looks like a spaceship.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.727
It’s like you’d look up
in the sky,

04:29.811 --> 04:31.521
and you would see this kind of

04:31.646 --> 04:34.566
twirling,
spinning ship in the sky.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.529
It seems to me, just looking
at it, they are trying to talk

04:40.655 --> 04:45.325
about beings coming from other
worlds, maybe to this place.

04:47.162 --> 04:49.372
Tell me about
that five-pointed star.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.795
HENRY:
Mm-hmm.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.846
Sometimes
the-the stars mean energy,

05:03.970 --> 05:07.060
like energy from the stars
would come to this place

05:07.182 --> 05:09.022
or star beings
would come to this place.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.232
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.742
Okay, so this is
like a newspaper then.

05:25.867 --> 05:29.037
It says, this was in
the sky above us

05:29.120 --> 05:31.750
at some point,
and this spaceman came down

05:31.873 --> 05:34.463
and maybe met
the Camunian people.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.757
NARRATOR: According
to the ancient stories,

05:40.882 --> 05:45.892
the city of Turin, just
155 miles from Val Camonica,

05:45.971 --> 05:49.351
was founded by a character
from Greek mythology called

05:49.432 --> 05:53.562
Phaeton who came
to Earth from the stars.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.567
Legend states that Turin
was founded by the god Phaeton,

05:57.691 --> 06:01.441
who is a son of the sun god
Helios and in the myth

06:01.570 --> 06:03.570
of Phaeton,
we learn the story of how

06:03.655 --> 06:06.995
he descended
to Earth in a fiery chariot.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.997
Perhaps crashing
into Mount Musinè.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.635
This also led
to something fortuitous

06:15.750 --> 06:18.170
because he brought gifts
to this place.

06:18.253 --> 06:21.133
He had great skills,
was a metallurgist.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.762
And taught this
to the local people.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.097
DAVID CHILDRESS:
When we look at myths
such as the myth of Phaeton,

06:30.181 --> 06:34.351
here is
really the story of a UFO

06:34.436 --> 06:38.606
landing on a mountain
and interacting with the locals.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.322
HENRY:
Given the-the
connection with the spacemen

06:42.444 --> 06:45.074
that are etched into the rock,
that we have to be open

06:45.155 --> 06:47.915
to the possibility that what
the ancient artist is trying

06:47.991 --> 06:51.331
to portray is something
that he actually saw in the sky,

06:51.453 --> 06:53.963
something
coming out of the heavens.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.789
NARRATOR:
Is there a connection
between the stone carvings found

06:56.917 --> 07:01.497
at Val Camonica and the story of
Phaeton’s descent from the sky?

07:01.630 --> 07:03.970
And do other clues exist here

07:04.049 --> 07:07.009
that point
to ancient alien contact?

07:08.136 --> 07:09.426
Were there any other cultures

07:09.512 --> 07:10.892
that were
connected with the valley?

07:18.688 --> 07:20.898
-What sort of engravings?
-Uh...

07:22.317 --> 07:26.067
Mm-hmm. Oh, the horned god,
yeah. Right.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.703
HENRY:
That means the Celts were here.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.870
So is the only location
where we see the spaceman?

07:43.755 --> 07:45.385
-Even deeper into the woods?
-Yeah.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.090
I’d love to go. All right.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.564
NARRATOR:
Luca guides William up
a steep portion of the valley

07:55.684 --> 07:58.234
for a rare look
at another carving

07:58.353 --> 08:00.193
hidden from public view.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.436
HENRY:
I’m all right, thanks.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.362
Wow.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.118
We’re-we’re like on
the edge of a cliff here.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.709
Wait a minute, that-that’s one
of them, isn’t it right there?

08:21.835 --> 08:24.635
Yeah. How cool!

08:24.713 --> 08:26.803
Wow!

08:30.051 --> 08:32.721
-Like the other one.
-HENRY: Yeah, these are
just like the other guys.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.256
Exactly.

08:35.390 --> 08:39.230
-HENRY: The detail is amazing.
-Yeah.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.652
Mm-hmm.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.364
There’s clearly
some kind of an exchange

08:48.445 --> 08:50.535
that’s happening here.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.703
It’s like they’re
making a photograph

08:52.782 --> 08:54.782
of what happened at this place.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.579
They’re trying to say,
"At this spot,

08:56.703 --> 08:58.413
this is what we saw here."

09:08.506 --> 09:11.796
HENRY:
Of-of all places to
find a rock like this.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.756
This is a very secretive,
almost initiatory place

09:14.846 --> 09:17.426
where select people would be
brought here to be told

09:17.557 --> 09:21.057
-this story
about these extraterrestrials.
-Yeah.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.154
NARRATOR:
Do the so-called "spacemen"

09:28.276 --> 09:32.236
of Val Camonica commemorate
an extraterrestrial visitation,

09:32.322 --> 09:36.622
as ancient astronaut theorists
suggest?

09:36.701 --> 09:38.951
Perhaps
further clues can be found

09:39.037 --> 09:43.037
by examining an Egyptian
temple covered in hieroglyphs...

09:43.124 --> 09:47.504
that tell the story
of the creation of humankind.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.011
Of all the mysterious
glyphs we’ve examined

09:56.137 --> 09:58.927
on <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
some of the most astounding

09:59.015 --> 10:00.345
can be found in Egypt, where
they’re known as hieroglyphs.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.056
One the most extensive
collections of hieroglyphs

10:04.145 --> 10:07.605
is at the Temple of Edfu,
and in 2018,

10:07.690 --> 10:10.320
Ramy Romany gave us
a rare opportunity

10:10.401 --> 10:12.901
to see them for ourselves.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.200
NARRATOR:
Edfu, Egypt. April 2018.

10:20.161 --> 10:24.291
Egyptologist Ramy Romany has
invited author and researcher

10:24.374 --> 10:26.634
Andrew Collins
to join him on a visit

10:26.709 --> 10:30.209
to one of the most impressive
and best-preserved shrines

10:30.338 --> 10:34.718
in Egypt, the Temple of Edfu,
located on the west bank

10:34.843 --> 10:39.513
of the Nile,
465 miles south of Cairo.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.637
Look at this temple.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.515
This is, like,
my most favorite façade

10:44.644 --> 10:46.854
in all of
the temples of ancient Egypt.

10:46.938 --> 10:50.778
NARRATOR:
According to mainstream
archaeologists, Edfu is believed

10:50.859 --> 10:56.319
to have been built
sometime between 237 and 57 BC.

10:56.406 --> 10:59.906
It is dedicated to
the falcon-headed god, Horus--

11:00.034 --> 11:03.044
the son of Osiris and Isis.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.673
This temple was one of
the last temples that was ever

11:05.748 --> 11:08.748
built in ancient Egypt,
during the Roman times.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.167
When they built
that temple, they were like,

11:11.254 --> 11:13.214
"We want
to preserve the stories.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.718
"So let’s
gather all the mythology

11:15.842 --> 11:19.352
of ancient Egypt and
try to put it in one temple."

11:19.429 --> 11:23.139
It took 150 years
to make this happen.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.694
And then finally,
we have the book

11:25.768 --> 11:27.398
of ancient Egyptian mythology.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.808
It’s right in front of us
on all these walls.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.111
Every wall
is absolutely covered,

11:34.235 --> 11:38.605
uh, in hieroglyphs and images,
not only of the foundation

11:38.740 --> 11:40.780
of ancient Egypt
and the first temple,

11:40.909 --> 11:43.739
but also how
the world came into being.

11:43.870 --> 11:48.460
How Egypt came into being,
how the universe

11:48.583 --> 11:50.923
was essentially
founded in the first place.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.252
I mean,
there’s just so much here.

11:54.255 --> 11:58.465
NARRATOR:
The most sacred part
of Edfu is its inner sanctum,

11:58.593 --> 12:01.683
featuring a 12-foot-tall
granite stone.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.177
This is it, right here.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.477
This is how it all began.

12:08.603 --> 12:11.193
Every symbol, every text,
every little drawing in here

12:11.272 --> 12:14.532
represents the most sacred thing
for ancient Egyptians.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.319
The question that humans now

12:17.445 --> 12:20.655
still ask themselves,
"How did it all began?

12:20.782 --> 12:22.992
What created us?"
Every religion talks about it.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.447
Scientist tries to figure out.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.958
Ancient Egyptians had an answer,
and it was right there.

12:31.459 --> 12:34.839
Right on top
of this is the pyramidion.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.303
That pyramidion is
the primeval mound

12:37.423 --> 12:41.843
that appeared in the middle of
marshes where all the gods came

12:41.970 --> 12:46.140
and landed on for the first
time to start creating humanity.

12:46.224 --> 12:50.104
This is
the beginning of humanity.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.936
And the pyramidion is
almost like a miniature

12:53.022 --> 12:56.032
of what we see at Giza,
with the Great Pyramid,

12:56.150 --> 13:00.150
uh, which is so fascinating,
because what we have here is

13:00.238 --> 13:03.778
a focus of all of
these chapels finishing

13:03.866 --> 13:08.076
with this incredible structure
pointing towards the stars.

13:09.831 --> 13:12.041
It’s actually pointing towards

13:12.166 --> 13:14.586
the origins
of the gods themselves.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.249
There’s another piece
of evidence here

13:16.337 --> 13:17.507
that you might like.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.760
This is the boat

13:20.842 --> 13:22.552
or a symbol of the boat

13:22.677 --> 13:26.347
that they believed
the gods came on to the first

13:26.431 --> 13:28.391
primeval stone.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.346
-Oh, that’s quite extraordinary.
-The first primeval mound.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.556
The gods would have arrived
on this ship.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.364
So it’s all here, in this
sanctuary, the whole story

13:38.484 --> 13:42.114
of humanity’s beginning,
you know, its place

13:42.196 --> 13:44.656
in the stars,
and how it arrived here

13:44.741 --> 13:46.411
in the first place. This to me

13:46.534 --> 13:49.204
strongly suggests
that they were aware

13:49.329 --> 13:52.079
that our origins are
found amongst the stars.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.626
Or could it just simply be

13:54.709 --> 13:57.039
humans trying to make religions

13:57.128 --> 13:59.918
explain what
science can’t explain?

14:00.048 --> 14:01.918
But I don’t think
it’s about religion.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.550
This is about cosmology.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.716
An ancient cosmology
that we’re now beginning

14:06.846 --> 14:09.266
to understand for the first
time, within science.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.600
We can now essentially
say that the idea that

14:12.727 --> 14:17.147
life came from the stars
is almost certainly a reality.

14:17.231 --> 14:20.691
Whether it came here
on a meteorite, or whatever,

14:20.777 --> 14:24.567
somehow
the ancient Egyptians knew this.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.777
NARRATOR:
Are the ancient hieroglyphs
carefully inscribed

14:28.910 --> 14:32.370
on the granite
stone at the Temple of Edfu

14:32.455 --> 14:35.835
merely the fanciful notions
of ancient Egyptian priests,

14:35.917 --> 14:39.417
or could they be based
on actual historical events?

14:39.545 --> 14:42.415
Perhaps the answers
can be found

14:42.548 --> 14:45.838
by examining an ancient glyph
that can only be seen

14:45.927 --> 14:48.007
from the sky.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.604
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
we have traveled

14:55.728 --> 14:57.898
around the world investigating
incredible glyphs that,

14:57.980 --> 15:02.030
for me, prove we are
not alone in the universe.

15:02.110 --> 15:07.240
Some of the most dramatic
examples of this are geoglyphs--

15:07.323 --> 15:09.703
enormous symbols
that have been carved

15:09.784 --> 15:14.374
into the Earth and can
only be seen from the sky.

15:14.455 --> 15:18.995
In 2018, David Childress
got a bird’s-eye view of one

15:19.127 --> 15:22.877
of the most amazing
geoglyphs we’ve ever examined.

15:26.968 --> 15:31.678
NARRATOR:
Located in the desert just
west of the Arizona border,

15:31.806 --> 15:35.056
an estimated
300 gigantic figures

15:35.143 --> 15:37.813
can be seen
etched in the arid ground.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.516
Known as the Blythe Intaglios,

15:41.649 --> 15:45.149
these ancient carvings
depict animals, spirals,

15:45.278 --> 15:50.198
and perhaps most significantly,
gigantic humanoid figures.

15:50.324 --> 15:53.244
These intaglios are unique

15:53.327 --> 15:57.537
in that they’re always found on
the shorelines of ancient lakes

15:57.665 --> 16:01.995
that existed
12,500 years ago and prior.

16:03.171 --> 16:07.841
NARRATOR: In April 2018,
ancient astronaut theorist

16:07.925 --> 16:11.385
David Childress
traveled to Blythe to meet

16:11.512 --> 16:14.312
with historian Patricia Robles
and Alfredo Figueroa,

16:14.390 --> 16:17.350
an elder of
the local Chemehuevi tribe.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.355
He is also known
to many in the region as

16:20.438 --> 16:21.978
"The Guardian of the Glyphs."

16:22.064 --> 16:24.234
David was eager to see

16:24.358 --> 16:26.568
firsthand whether
the legends surrounding

16:26.694 --> 16:28.574
these unique
geoglyphs could be true.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.856
They can only be seen
from the air, really, right?

16:30.948 --> 16:32.158
Well, they can be
seen from the ground

16:32.241 --> 16:34.411
but you can see it all intact.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.405
If you’re walking on it,
you really don’t know what

16:36.537 --> 16:38.957
-you’re walking on.
-Exactly. Yeah, right.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.710
We’ll be able to see it
with the drone, I think.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.381
Oh, that’s excellent,
you got a drone?

16:42.502 --> 16:43.882
-Excellent, excellent.
-Yes, we got-- Let me get...

16:44.003 --> 16:45.633
-Oh, that’s wonderful.
-It’s the best way.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.383
-Okay, let me get it.
-Thank you.

16:49.050 --> 16:51.090
Who builds this and-and why?

16:51.219 --> 16:53.259
The original tribes
here were the Aztecas.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.557
-The Aztecs.
-Right.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.430
-Okay.
-How about...

16:56.557 --> 16:58.347
There he goes.

17:03.773 --> 17:06.323
Wow, that’s pretty interesting.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.820
NARRATOR:
With the drone camera, David,
Patricia and Alfredo

17:10.905 --> 17:14.415
are able to see the Blythe
Intaglios from a vantage point

17:14.492 --> 17:16.582
that their creators
never could have--

17:16.661 --> 17:21.211
at least, not without the
aid of some form of aircraft.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.960
But if this is true,
then why were they created?

17:25.086 --> 17:26.836
And for whom?

17:26.921 --> 17:29.511
-CHILDRESS:
All right, this is...
-FIGUEROA: Is Omecihuatl.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.720
"Cihuatl" means "woman."

17:32.802 --> 17:35.642
And she is pregnant,
right here, see.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.353
CHILDRESS:
She’s like having a baby then.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.061
-Aw, okay.
-And right next to her,

17:40.142 --> 17:42.062
is the Ocelot.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.274
Ocelot is the jaguar.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.647
Okay, so you can see it’s a cat
because it has a very long tail.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.444
-Uh, is that...?
-Well, the tail is
supposed to be

17:49.569 --> 17:51.699
-like a "U."
-A loop.

17:51.779 --> 17:56.529
And in the cosmos, it represents
the-the Big Dipper.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.157
ROBLES: Here in this place,
they came down.

17:59.287 --> 18:02.457
And because they descended from
the cosmos,

18:02.582 --> 18:05.752
our ancestors created
these images

18:05.835 --> 18:09.765
and aligned them
with the constellations.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.969
So that we would
understand that story.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.640
NARRATOR:
But of all the Blythe Intaglios,

18:15.720 --> 18:18.970
the ones Alfredo is
most eager to show David are

18:19.098 --> 18:22.768
those that are the largest
and arguably the most dramatic.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.442
CHILDRESS:
This is big. This thing is huge.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.610
FIGUEROA:
That’s right.

18:27.898 --> 18:31.318
NARRATOR:
They are the ones representing
the Aztec gods Kokopelli--

18:31.402 --> 18:33.402
better known as Quetzalcoatl--

18:33.487 --> 18:36.907
and Cicimitl,
the Aztec star god.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.581
Which glyph is this one?

18:38.659 --> 18:40.659
What we’re seeing here
is Kokopelli.

18:40.745 --> 18:43.085
And he represents Quetzalcoatl.

18:43.164 --> 18:46.584
CHILDRESS:
The Aztec, uh,
god of Quetzalcoatl.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.587
-So this one is...
-ROBLES: Cicimitl.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.670
CHILDRESS:
Cicimitl.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.934
His face there.
You see his nose.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.430
He’s not like
a normal person, is he?

18:58.512 --> 19:01.472
No, he looks just like a...
an E.T.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.017
He looks like an
extraterrestrial, uh-huh, yeah.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.435
NARRATOR:
An extraterrestrial?

19:07.521 --> 19:11.731
Is it possible that these
incredible geoglyphs represent

19:11.859 --> 19:15.649
not just mythological gods,
but actual alien beings

19:15.738 --> 19:20.328
whose arrival on Earth was
witnessed by the Azteca people?

19:20.409 --> 19:23.909
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

19:24.038 --> 19:27.748
and Alfredo Figueroa is
convinced that it was here,

19:27.875 --> 19:30.665
the location of
the Aztecs’ legendary home

19:30.753 --> 19:36.303
of Aztlan where extraterrestrial
visitors came down from the sky.

19:36.384 --> 19:40.304
CHILDRESS:
Aztlan is very
important in Aztec mythology.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.558
It was a place
where the gods came down

19:42.682 --> 19:46.062
to give them
the information and prophecies

19:46.143 --> 19:49.103
that the Aztecs had.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.730
I mean, you’re maintaining
that this whole area here,

19:51.816 --> 19:53.976
around Blythe
and the Colorado River

19:54.068 --> 19:56.698
is an ancient homeland
of-of the Aztecs

19:56.779 --> 19:59.239
-and-and the gods, too?
-Yes.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.493
The geoglyphs were made by...

20:01.575 --> 20:03.615
the Nahuatl people.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.664
The Nahuatl are the origin

20:05.746 --> 20:07.656
of the Aztecas and the Mexicas.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.248
So, they’re the ones
that made ’em at-at first.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.004
And then the Nahuatl
people made these geoglyphs

20:13.087 --> 20:16.667
to-to honor...
the-the creator gods.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.427
Right, and to not
forget where we came from.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.642
Where we came from,
that’s right.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.392
NARRATOR:
Could it be
that Blythe, California

20:24.473 --> 20:27.603
really was the ancestral
home of the Aztec people,

20:27.727 --> 20:30.687
and that more
than 1,000 years ago

20:30.771 --> 20:34.941
the area was visited
by extraterrestrial beings?

20:35.025 --> 20:39.025
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that the answers may be

20:39.113 --> 20:42.703
found by examining the most
mysterious glyphs of all.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.663
Incredible images of visitors

20:45.786 --> 20:47.866
from the sky.

20:53.961 --> 20:58.091
Any discussion ofd
mysterious glyphs has to include

20:58.174 --> 20:59.684
the incredible ancient rock
art of the Native Americans.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.140
In 2013,
I got the rare opportunity

21:03.220 --> 21:05.470
to examine
a remarkable collection

21:05.598 --> 21:08.678
of petroglyphs in the Zuni
territory of New Mexico

21:08.809 --> 21:12.189
with tribal elder,
Clifford Mahooty.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.740
NARRATOR: Located at an
elevation of over 6,000 feet,

21:19.820 --> 21:23.490
this barren desert land
has been home to the Zuni

21:23.616 --> 21:26.366
for at least 1,300 years.

21:26.494 --> 21:29.504
Stretching
roughly 700 square miles,

21:29.622 --> 21:32.922
it contains literally
thousands of ancient carvings

21:33.000 --> 21:36.670
that most outsiders
have never laid eyes on.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.885
And the Zuni
claim that some of these

21:40.007 --> 21:43.677
petroglyphs depict
visitations from star beings.

21:44.887 --> 21:47.637
CLIFFORD MAHOOTY:
To the Zuni people
and other tribes,

21:47.723 --> 21:51.273
there’s a spiritual
connection with the star beings.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.108
They’re the ones that actually
rule the-the universe

21:55.189 --> 21:57.399
or the world that we’re on.

21:57.525 --> 22:00.405
If you look at the petroglyphs,
there’s a lot of references

22:00.528 --> 22:03.568
to those type of, uh, entities.

22:03.697 --> 22:06.577
There’s definitely
evidence that aliens visited

22:06.700 --> 22:08.740
North America
in the distant past.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.039
And there are petroglyphs
throughout this part

22:11.163 --> 22:13.583
of the country carved
by ancient Americans

22:13.707 --> 22:16.077
that depict just that.

22:19.213 --> 22:23.053
In 2013,
ancient astronaut theorist

22:23.175 --> 22:25.715
Giorgio Tsoukalos,
traveled to New Mexico

22:25.803 --> 22:28.933
to meet with Zuni elder
Clifford Mahooty,

22:29.056 --> 22:32.766
and get an exclusive look
at this mysterious rock art.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.943
What can you tell me about
this petroglyph right here?

22:36.063 --> 22:39.443
Well, you know, if you can
see on top of that

22:39.567 --> 22:42.567
where maybe a head would be,
it’s kind of eroded off.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.955
But on the next part of it
there’s four compartments

22:45.072 --> 22:47.782
look like extension
of something sticking out.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.618
TSOUKALOS:
Yeah, almost like legs.

22:49.743 --> 22:53.213
It could be something
that they saw in the air.

22:54.999 --> 22:59.629
Isn’t there a legend that beings
visited on top of this mountain?

22:59.753 --> 23:03.133
Oh, yes.
Uh, on all of the mesas.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.930
Look at that triangle up there.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.641
TSOUKALOS:
And you’ve got the dots
around it that have been carved

23:09.763 --> 23:12.023
into the rock that remind me
of, like, stars.

23:12.099 --> 23:15.229
In conjunction with all
the stories of star people

23:15.311 --> 23:19.691
descending from the sky in fiery
shields and things like this,

23:19.773 --> 23:22.863
when I see a pattern like that,

23:22.943 --> 23:26.823
I always think, what if this
is something that they saw,

23:26.947 --> 23:30.657
and then
they carved onto a rock?

23:30.784 --> 23:33.664
For something like this
that they saw maybe in the sky

23:33.787 --> 23:35.827
or had an encounter,
they would come over here

23:35.956 --> 23:38.536
and say, "Well, it, um,
it looked like this."

23:38.626 --> 23:41.956
So they were put on there
and say, "Well, the best

23:42.087 --> 23:44.797
of my-my recollection,
here’s what it looked like."

23:44.924 --> 23:47.634
So they would put it on there.
So this is a permanent record.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.850
-Right. Oh, no.
That is why stone was used.
-Yeah. Yeah.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.681
-It is the only
permanent record that we have.
-Mm-hmm.

23:53.807 --> 23:57.517
MAHOOTY:
Yes. And-and
the thing about it is that...

23:57.645 --> 24:00.815
how does
it connect to present day?

24:00.898 --> 24:03.228
I mean, there
are certain things out here

24:03.317 --> 24:04.687
where you can look at it.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.698
Okay, for example, the UFO.

24:06.820 --> 24:09.990
We didn’t know anything about
UFOs until the last century.

24:10.074 --> 24:12.374
But all those years,
they knew about them.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.663
They saw them,
and somebody says, "Okay,

24:14.745 --> 24:17.215
I’m going to put this
down here for longevity."

24:17.331 --> 24:19.501
And they say,
"Grandson, I want to show you

24:19.583 --> 24:21.253
what I saw
when I was a young man."

24:21.335 --> 24:23.045
And they’ll come over
and show you,

24:23.170 --> 24:26.260
that’s exactly what I saw
and here’s what it looked like.

24:27.424 --> 24:30.264
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that these ancient rock carvings

24:30.344 --> 24:32.724
in remote areas
of the Zuni territory

24:32.846 --> 24:37.806
provide a historical record
of extraterrestrial contact?

24:39.853 --> 24:42.733
You can find petroglyphs
that are similar to those

24:42.856 --> 24:46.356
in the Zuni territory all
throughout North America.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.453
And surprisingly,
nearly identical drawings

24:49.530 --> 24:52.990
can be found on
the other side of the planet.

24:58.622 --> 25:01.082
New South Wales, Australia.

25:03.877 --> 25:05.837
The Bulgandry preservation site

25:05.921 --> 25:08.801
is one of numerous
sacred Indigenous locations

25:08.882 --> 25:12.642
where ancient rock art
and engravings can be found.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.760
Many are believed to
date back thousands of years.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.269
Wow.

25:19.393 --> 25:22.603
NARRATOR:
In February 2016, researcher

25:22.730 --> 25:24.770
and publisher Giorgio Tsoukalos

25:24.898 --> 25:26.568
traveled to Australia to meet

25:26.692 --> 25:29.572
with Aboriginal Elder
Kevin Gavi Duncan

25:29.653 --> 25:33.703
to learn about one of the oldest
carvings that can be found here.

25:38.287 --> 25:40.367
So what are we looking at here?

25:40.456 --> 25:43.996
So this image is
an actual image of what we say

25:44.084 --> 25:48.304
is our Godfather
creator being, Baiame.

25:48.422 --> 25:51.132
-That’s what our people believe.
-Okay.

25:51.258 --> 25:54.968
Baiame came from a place
that we call the Morning Star

25:55.095 --> 25:57.135
-within the Mirrabooka.
-Mm-hmm.

25:57.264 --> 26:00.434
"Mirra" means "stars"
and "booka" means "river."

26:00.559 --> 26:02.979
That is the Milky Way
that flows across the night sky.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.853
-No kidding? Okay.
-Yes.

26:06.774 --> 26:09.484
And so he is one
of those Sky-Heroes

26:09.610 --> 26:11.610
that has descended
from the Milky Way?

26:11.737 --> 26:13.907
Yes.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.697
He’s a Sky-Hero.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.704
And Baiame is carved

26:18.786 --> 26:22.576
in the manner that you see,
he has his arms out.

26:22.664 --> 26:26.084
And he holds
the Moon in one hand...

26:27.920 --> 26:30.510
...and the Morning Star
in the other...

26:30.631 --> 26:34.681
which is a bit like
what we call planet Earth.

26:34.802 --> 26:37.392
And these are the two moons

26:37.471 --> 26:40.061
which exist
around the Morning Star

26:40.140 --> 26:43.350
and the Mirrabooka
that Baiame came from.

26:43.477 --> 26:44.937
TSOUKALOS:
Mm-hmm.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.690
And this is the canoe.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.859
He sailed
through the river of life,

26:51.985 --> 26:54.235
um, in the Mirrabooka across
the sky world.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.951
TSOUKALOS:
So he sailed
through the Milky Way?

26:56.031 --> 26:58.241
DUNCAN:
Yes, he sailed
through the Milky Way.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.044
And this was his vessel

27:01.161 --> 27:04.251
that he sailed,
and he landed, to the Earth.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.881
And he crushed the top
of the mountain which is

27:08.001 --> 27:11.381
the sacred mountain of
Mount Yengo not far from here.

27:13.841 --> 27:15.971
And when he landed,
they said the fire

27:16.051 --> 27:18.511
came from his feet and it burnt
the mount-- the top

27:18.595 --> 27:21.305
of the mountain and all
around it every time he landed.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.140
So the landings
were always associated

27:23.225 --> 27:25.855
-with a lot of noise,
smoke and fire?
-Yes!

27:27.604 --> 27:29.314
The fire trail that was

27:29.398 --> 27:31.858
left when Baiame was
leaving the top of the mountain

27:31.942 --> 27:36.072
into the sky world, when
Baiame had left was so bright...

27:36.196 --> 27:38.696
people interpret
that as a spaceship

27:38.782 --> 27:41.202
-of some kind
as coming and going.
-Yeah.

27:41.326 --> 27:46.666
But this is the way we simply
interpret Baiame’s spaceship.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.878
Right. But it’s
because the vocabulary

27:49.001 --> 27:50.671
didn’t exist at the time.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.922
-Yes.
-So, to me, those are all

27:53.046 --> 27:57.426
wonderfully poetic ways to
describe eyewitness accounts

27:57.551 --> 28:00.391
of things that were incredible.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.890
Yes. This site is considered

28:03.015 --> 28:05.565
around 8,000
to 10,000 years old.

28:05.642 --> 28:07.102
Wow!

28:08.061 --> 28:11.731
These carvings. These rock
paintings, these are our books.

28:11.815 --> 28:14.475
They are considered to be

28:14.568 --> 28:16.948
basically our truth.

28:19.281 --> 28:23.241
NARRATOR:
Do the petroglyphs found
in Australia and North America

28:23.368 --> 28:26.538
tell the same
story of alien visitation?

28:26.622 --> 28:30.132
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

28:30.250 --> 28:33.130
and suggest that another series
of rock carvings

28:33.253 --> 28:35.263
found in Australia

28:35.339 --> 28:39.049
may reveal the truth about
how these otherworldly visitors

28:39.134 --> 28:41.934
arrived on planet Earth.

28:46.433 --> 28:49.893
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
we’ve examined glyphs all over

28:49.978 --> 28:53.268
the world and we find strikingly
similar imagery again and again.

28:53.398 --> 28:56.108
But what
was completely unexpected

28:56.235 --> 28:58.785
was the discovery of
what are clearly Egyptian

28:58.904 --> 29:02.664
hieroglyphs not in Egypt,
but in Australia.

29:03.784 --> 29:07.704
NARRATOR:
Central Coast,
New South Wales, Australia.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.004
Deep in
the Brisbane Water National Park

29:12.125 --> 29:15.375
is a mysterious site
known as the Gosford Glyphs.

29:17.130 --> 29:20.630
The site consists of two
massive, eight-foot-high walls

29:20.717 --> 29:24.217
engraved with
over 300 ancient carvings.

29:24.304 --> 29:30.144
Carvings that experts say do
not resemble Indigenous artwork,

29:30.269 --> 29:32.309
but Egyptian hieroglyphs.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.653
After deciphering the texts,

29:38.777 --> 29:41.527
21st century
Egyptologist Ray Johnson

29:41.655 --> 29:43.625
believed them to
reveal the burial site

29:43.699 --> 29:46.329
of Lord Nefer-Ti-Ru,

29:46.451 --> 29:48.581
a member of the Egyptian
royal family

29:48.662 --> 29:51.162
who died while visiting
the area with his brother

29:51.248 --> 29:55.998
sometime
between 2637 and 2614 BC.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.970
Absolutely beautiful out here.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.385
Oh, I know.

30:08.515 --> 30:11.845
NARRATOR:
While visiting the area in 2016,

30:11.935 --> 30:13.595
Giorgio Tsoukalos

30:13.687 --> 30:16.307
met with local
ancient astronaut theorist

30:16.398 --> 30:19.028
Evan Strong
to get a firsthand look

30:19.109 --> 30:21.189
at these enigmatic carvings.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.700
-And here we are.
-Wow!

30:24.364 --> 30:26.454
TSOUKALOS:
That’s incredible.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.907
I had no idea.
I mean, this looks totally

30:31.038 --> 30:32.748
different than on pictures.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.839
So what do
these hieroglyphs say?

30:36.918 --> 30:39.838
Well, at least one
panel talks about two brothers,

30:39.921 --> 30:42.091
two princes,
coming here from Egypt.

30:42.215 --> 30:43.795
They were shipwrecked.

30:43.884 --> 30:46.804
One of ’em ended up getting
bitten by a snake. He then died.

30:46.887 --> 30:49.137
The theory is
then he was interred here

30:49.222 --> 30:51.392
and that’s why you’ve
got hieroglyphs here.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.355
-Mm-hmm.
-Because he died here.

30:53.435 --> 30:56.865
But there’s these other
walls with a mixture of symbols.

30:56.938 --> 31:00.438
This one over here,
it’s more of a philosophical

31:00.567 --> 31:04.397
astrophysics style
thing with symbols meaning

31:04.488 --> 31:07.778
all sorts
of esoteric stuff so...

31:07.908 --> 31:10.198
Now, have-have
these symbols at all been

31:10.285 --> 31:12.115
interpreted by Egyptologists?

31:12.245 --> 31:15.365
-There’ve been a few actually.
-Mm-hmm.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.577
A few different
people have done that.

31:17.667 --> 31:20.377
-And what was their reaction?
-Well, Raymond Johnson was one

31:20.462 --> 31:22.552
of the first people
to come here and-and translate.

31:23.590 --> 31:26.430
He actually sent some
of his translations off

31:26.510 --> 31:30.760
to the Cairo library
and Dr. Abu Dhia Ghazi,

31:30.889 --> 31:33.389
ended up saying, "Yep,
you’re on the right track."

31:33.475 --> 31:35.605
It’s something
called proto-Egyptian.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.937
And how old
do you reckon these are?

31:38.021 --> 31:40.571
We’re thinking
because of the prevalence,

31:40.649 --> 31:43.859
at least in one
panel of proto-Egyptian,

31:43.944 --> 31:46.204
that it’s about 4,600 years old.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.989
Wow. Are there any hieroglyphs

31:49.116 --> 31:50.486
that stand out to you?

31:50.617 --> 31:52.117
Yeah, definitely.
Follow me down here,

31:52.202 --> 31:54.912
and I’ll show you
this other one.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.170
So this one here, um, we call

31:59.292 --> 32:01.292
the UFO glyph and people have
called it that since they’ve

32:01.420 --> 32:04.130
been coming here because
it kind of looks like a UFO.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.514
TSOUKALOS:
Yeah, it definitely
has the classic UFO shape.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.593
It’s got the-the rays

32:08.677 --> 32:11.137
or whatever you want to call it.

32:11.221 --> 32:13.511
What would you suggest
if anyone says, "Well,

32:13.640 --> 32:16.060
"this is not a UFO.
It’s some other symbol,

32:16.143 --> 32:17.693
but certainly not that"?

32:17.811 --> 32:20.021
I think someone
suggested that it’s jewelry

32:20.147 --> 32:21.807
but it’s a completely
different symbol that’s

32:21.898 --> 32:24.108
upside down and
it really doesn’t quite fit in.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.532
It’s one of
those symbols here that,

32:26.653 --> 32:28.363
that doesn’t fit into the canon.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.158
In your opinion,
why do you think the Egyptians

32:31.241 --> 32:33.031
made it all the way
to Australia?

32:33.160 --> 32:36.870
I think they were looking
for esoteric wisdom, definitely.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.537
-From the Aboriginals?
-Yes.

32:42.502 --> 32:46.512
DUNCAN:
The ancient Egyptians, we have
stories, and Aboriginal stories,

32:46.631 --> 32:49.181
about their arrival,
and about their visits

32:49.301 --> 32:51.721
long before
Europeans had arrived here.

32:53.180 --> 32:55.890
Naturally we would
have shared ceremony

32:56.016 --> 32:59.516
with these people, because they
have the same similar beliefs

32:59.644 --> 33:01.404
as our people.

33:01.521 --> 33:03.901
Egyptians have that same

33:04.024 --> 33:06.944
spiritual connection
to the sky world.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.025
NARRATOR:
Hieroglyphs found in Australia?

33:13.158 --> 33:16.198
Might the continent
have actually served

33:16.328 --> 33:18.908
as a pilgrimage site
for visitors seeking

33:19.039 --> 33:22.249
a direct connection
to the so-called gods?

33:22.375 --> 33:25.245
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

33:25.378 --> 33:30.218
and suggest further evidence
of this otherworldly link can be

33:30.342 --> 33:33.892
found in one of the most
remote places in the world.

33:41.311 --> 33:43.981
What’s fascinating
about many of the glyphs

33:44.064 --> 33:45.944
we’ve examined on <i>Ancient Aliens</i>
is that they depict

33:46.066 --> 33:50.146
the natural world of our
ancestors with extreme accuracy.

33:50.237 --> 33:53.157
But every now and then
we find a bird that looks

33:53.240 --> 33:57.040
more like an airplane
or a serpent with wings...

33:57.118 --> 34:00.788
or even a turtle
descending from the sky.

34:00.914 --> 34:03.794
And this is exactly
what I found at one

34:03.917 --> 34:06.417
of the most remote locations
in the world,

34:06.503 --> 34:08.173
the Marquesas Islands.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.430
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorists

34:16.513 --> 34:19.103
Giorgio Tsoukalos
and David Childress

34:19.182 --> 34:22.312
set out to explore
the remote Marquesas Islands,

34:22.435 --> 34:25.185
in search of evidence
that extraterrestrial contact

34:25.272 --> 34:27.942
took place here
in the remote past.

34:29.025 --> 34:32.025
-Hello. I’m Giorgio.
-ANIATA KIMITETE: Hello.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.952
-Pleasure to meet you.
-I’m Aniata.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.322
Hi, I’m David.

34:35.448 --> 34:37.368
NARRATOR: Arriving on
the island of Nuku Hiva,

34:37.450 --> 34:41.120
they are met by local guide,
Aniata Kimitete.

34:41.204 --> 34:42.754
-Let’s go explore.
-Great.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.461
All right.

34:46.876 --> 34:48.626
NARRATOR:
She has brought them
to an area known

34:48.712 --> 34:50.212
as Kamuihei,

34:50.297 --> 34:52.297
a sacred place
believed to be rich

34:52.424 --> 34:56.894
in what the natives call
"mana" or "spiritual power."

34:57.929 --> 35:01.349
So we are arriving at
this spot where I really

35:01.474 --> 35:03.814
-wanted to
show you about this site.
-Oh, look at this.

35:05.228 --> 35:08.228
KIMITETE:
What we see here,
it’s what we call petroglyphs.

35:08.315 --> 35:09.575
TSOUKALOS:
Yeah.

35:09.649 --> 35:12.489
So you have three turtles.
So one,

35:12.569 --> 35:14.529
two, three.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.114
Here.

35:16.197 --> 35:20.577
And also on the rock
you can see a canoe.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.370
-Okay.
-So you have
the head of the canoe here

35:23.496 --> 35:25.666
that looks
a little bit like a bird.

35:25.749 --> 35:28.329
Their canoes had
a bird head at the front.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.420
TSOUKALOS:
You see the beak.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.593
-CHILDRESS: Yeah, that looks
like a bird head.
-KIMITETE: Yeah.

35:32.672 --> 35:35.222
And what is the significance
of the turtles?

35:35.342 --> 35:37.642
KIMITETE:
The turtle is actually

35:37.719 --> 35:42.559
the messenger from the gods.
He was a very sacred animal.

35:42.682 --> 35:45.272
People were
not allowed to eat them.

35:45.352 --> 35:47.602
TSOUKALOS:
You know, I think this is
really interesting what you said

35:47.687 --> 35:50.437
that the turtle is regarded
here as messenger of the gods,

35:50.523 --> 35:53.113
because
this is not something new.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.953
It’s not something
native to this area.

35:56.029 --> 35:58.659
There are other
parts of the world where...

35:58.740 --> 36:02.660
the turtle is described by
having descended from the sky.

36:02.744 --> 36:06.414
And the idea that this
is here too considered

36:06.539 --> 36:10.129
a messenger of the gods,
that to me is a connection

36:10.210 --> 36:13.050
to potential extraterrestrials.

36:15.674 --> 36:16.924
NARRATOR:
Throughout the planet,

36:17.050 --> 36:19.760
numerous ancient cultures
have origin stories

36:19.886 --> 36:23.056
that involve some sort
of divine or cosmic turtle.

36:24.724 --> 36:28.234
Followers of Japanese Shinto
venerate the Kame-ishi.

36:28.353 --> 36:32.273
A stone turtle that portends
the end of the world.

36:32.399 --> 36:36.899
In Guatemala, there are
legends of giant flying turtles

36:37.028 --> 36:40.698
and even artifacts that feature
the image of a man wearing what

36:40.782 --> 36:44.742
appears to be a helmet
lying inside a turtle shell.

36:45.912 --> 36:49.422
In North America,
the Iroquois Indians tell tales

36:49.541 --> 36:53.131
of a "sky goddess" who falls
to Earth from the heavens,

36:53.253 --> 36:57.763
whereupon a giant turtle rises
up from the ocean to catch her.

36:59.592 --> 37:03.142
I think it’s interesting
here this canoe which would

37:03.263 --> 37:06.433
have been very large,
has the bird head on it.

37:06.516 --> 37:08.476
And you have the birdmen

37:08.601 --> 37:10.901
of Easter Island that are
so famous.

37:11.771 --> 37:14.441
NARRATOR: One of Easter Island’s
ancient traditions

37:14.566 --> 37:18.816
involves Tangata manu,
or the Birdman cult.

37:18.945 --> 37:23.115
According to legend,
the creator god Make-Make

37:23.199 --> 37:27.159
was looking in a mirror and
saw a bird land on his shoulder.

37:27.287 --> 37:29.997
Seeing his image
combined with the bird,

37:30.123 --> 37:34.213
he decided to make a son
who was half man, half bird.

37:34.294 --> 37:37.804
In turn, the Rapa Nui
people of Easter Island

37:37.922 --> 37:42.592
worshiped the birdman as
the predecessor of all humans.

37:44.387 --> 37:47.427
One of the central
focuses of the rituals,

37:47.515 --> 37:51.225
the annual
rituals at Easter Island...

37:52.228 --> 37:56.898
...was that of Tangata manu,
the birdman.

37:56.983 --> 38:00.533
And the birdman is
a universal symbol that we find

38:00.653 --> 38:05.123
in many parts of the globe
that relates to ancestry

38:05.200 --> 38:07.830
associated with figures,

38:07.952 --> 38:10.912
characters in
feather coats who were seen

38:10.997 --> 38:15.667
to be able to go between
this world and the next.

38:15.794 --> 38:20.054
And here we have
the same ideas on Easter Island.

38:20.173 --> 38:22.723
CHILDRESS:
Is there more
to see on the island?

38:22.842 --> 38:25.932
-We have a lot more to see
on the island.
-Okay.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.182
-So let’s go.
-CHILDRESS: Okay.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.965
NARRATOR:
After showing Giorgio

38:29.057 --> 38:31.267
and David
the ancient petroglyphs,

38:31.351 --> 38:34.061
Aniata takes them
to a site that has

38:34.187 --> 38:36.937
some of the most striking
statuary in the Marquesas.

38:37.857 --> 38:40.777
Right now we are
at the Tohua of Temehea.

38:40.860 --> 38:43.240
So the Tohua
is the gathering place.

38:43.363 --> 38:47.493
And so this sculpture
here is a modern sculpture.

38:47.575 --> 38:50.615
But, is this
based on something old?

38:50.703 --> 38:54.713
KIMITETE:
Yes. Because the site
that we are on was rebuilt.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.381
Even though it’s modern,
it’s really based

38:57.502 --> 38:59.382
on the original statue.

38:59.504 --> 39:02.094
TSOUKALOS:
Oh, wow. Okay.
Is this considered a Tiki?

39:02.215 --> 39:05.895
Yes, this Tiki
represents the population.

39:06.010 --> 39:09.060
So to the Marquesan
people, what is a Tiki?

39:09.138 --> 39:11.848
A Tiki at first
was the representation

39:11.933 --> 39:14.943
of our god of magic and sorcery.

39:15.061 --> 39:17.811
He was one of
the only god in French Polynesia

39:17.897 --> 39:20.397
that has the face of a man.

39:21.568 --> 39:26.448
He became our protector,
because when you have a Tiki

39:26.573 --> 39:29.373
by your side, then you are
protected from your enemy.

39:30.493 --> 39:34.003
NARRATOR:
In the Marquesas, the word
"Tiki" can be used to refer

39:34.080 --> 39:35.580
both to an ancestral figure

39:35.665 --> 39:38.135
that came
to the islands in ancient times,

39:38.251 --> 39:41.341
as well as the statues
that represent him.

39:41.421 --> 39:45.171
They are variously
carved in both wood and stone,

39:45.258 --> 39:49.008
and often depict a being
with large, goggle-like eyes.

39:50.096 --> 39:53.306
And this is what Tiki looks
like... as a god?

39:53.433 --> 39:57.403
Yes, because they say
in the legend that when Tiki

39:57.478 --> 39:59.558
left the Earth,
they made the sculpture

39:59.647 --> 40:01.937
of how he looked like, just...

40:02.066 --> 40:04.686
to have something
to remember from Tiki.

40:04.777 --> 40:07.237
So that’s how
he looked like actually.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.952
It looks very strange to me.

40:10.074 --> 40:12.454
If this is
a representation of what

40:12.577 --> 40:16.537
your ancestors thought
this figure looked like,

40:16.623 --> 40:20.333
it doesn’t look like a man,
it looks weird.

40:20.460 --> 40:23.130
Yeah. I mean, he-he sort
of looks like a man,

40:23.254 --> 40:27.054
but with these big goggle eyes
and the elongated head

40:27.133 --> 40:30.303
and everything, he looks
like an extraterrestrial.

40:31.471 --> 40:33.971
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
glyphs found on nearly

40:34.057 --> 40:36.137
every continent reveal

40:36.225 --> 40:38.225
that ancient people
all over the world

40:38.311 --> 40:42.231
encountered
extraterrestrial visitors?

40:42.315 --> 40:45.035
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that some

40:45.151 --> 40:47.071
rock art provides a record

40:47.153 --> 40:50.573
not only of alien contact,
but even

40:50.657 --> 40:53.157
of how they got here.

40:54.077 --> 40:56.747
Could these
mysterious petroglyphs

40:56.829 --> 41:00.669
provide the best evidence
yet of ancient alien contact?

41:00.792 --> 41:04.632
To me, the ultimate proof
lies in the fact that

41:04.712 --> 41:07.262
all over the world,
cultures that were separated

41:07.340 --> 41:09.130
by thousands of miles

41:09.217 --> 41:13.757
carved the same strange figures
and symbols again and again,

41:13.846 --> 41:15.926
leaving us with
a record of extraterrestrial

41:16.015 --> 41:18.095
intervention on Earth.

41:18.184 --> 41:22.404
Our alien origins are in
plain sight for anyone to see.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.944
You only need to read
the writing on the wall.
