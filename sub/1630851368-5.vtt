06:16.744 --> 06:18.510

understand it.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.846
He thinks because, like,
I looked out for myself,

06:20.914 --> 06:22.748
that's a direct shot at him.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.751
- Fessy made the first shot.
He took a shot at Amber.

06:25.819 --> 06:29.821
Amber's technically a vet,

06:29.890 --> 06:31.857

When in reality, that's not
what's best for your game.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.730

looking out for me,

06:38.799 --> 06:40.198

You know, whoop, whoop, boom.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.006
<i> - ♪ Move for me,</i>
<i> move for me, move for me ♪</i>

31:16.075 --> 31:18.475
<i> - I'm definitely happy</i>
<i> being partnered up with Ed.</i>

31:18.544 --> 31:20.878
He's just got one of those
personalities that you're like,

31:20.946 --> 31:22.746
"Are you even a real person?"

31:22.815 --> 31:24.348
- He's just going.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.016
<i> - I'm a professional dancer.</i>

31:26.085 --> 31:28.919
And Ed needs
some dancing lessons.

31:28.988 --> 31:32.990
<i> - ♪ And when you're done I'll</i>

31:33.058 --> 31:35.425
<i> ♪ All again ♪</i>

31:37.696 --> 31:40.564
But we are not good
as partners.

31:40.633 --> 31:42.699
<i> - This partnership</i>
<i> is not good,</i>

31:42.768 --> 31:47.304
and we just have to switch
partners as fast as we can.

31:47.373 --> 31:48.805
I had a partner, Nany.

31:48.874 --> 31:53.310
And I had a really
good connection with her.

31:53.379 --> 31:56.146
- Gabo wants to go in
because he wants to get

31:56.215 --> 31:57.481
<i> his baby Nany back.</i>

31:57.549 --> 31:59.416
<i> I don't take it personal.</i>

31:59.485 --> 32:01.752
I can't wait for him
to leave me.

32:01.820 --> 32:07.291
Honestly, just please go
and fly like a butterfly.

32:10.996 --> 32:13.463
...making it better.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.371
It's gonna be
a guy elimination.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.806
- We don't know that.

32:22.875 --> 32:25.642
But based on how everything's
going with Aneesa

32:25.711 --> 32:28.445
being sent home, that's
probably what's gonna happen.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.881
- And if it's gonna be
physical,

32:30.950 --> 32:34.418
there is a chance
that I can stay in the house.

32:35.721 --> 32:38.622
- Yeah.

32:38.691 --> 32:41.725
- I am 1,000% okay
working with you again.

32:41.794 --> 32:44.127
- Trust is very important
in this game.

32:44.196 --> 32:47.864
And I would go battle for Nany.
She's a good person.

32:47.933 --> 32:50.500
And I like these
kind of people around me.

32:50.569 --> 32:54.972
The thing is that I have
no experience in these games.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.907
I'm not an athlete.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.777
Do you see how good you've done
in every single challenge.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.879
You underestimate yourself
and your abilities.

33:02.948 --> 33:04.614
And that's not okay 'cause...

33:06.785 --> 33:10.454
I have been underestimated
my entire "Challenge" career.

33:10.522 --> 33:13.390
<i> So when I see other people,</i>
<i> especially rookies,</i>

33:13.459 --> 33:14.891
doubt themselves,

33:14.960 --> 33:16.593
I feel like they just need
somebody there to be like,

33:16.662 --> 33:18.261
"No, no, no.
Like, you can do it."

33:18.330 --> 33:20.530
Whatever you do tomorrow,

33:20.599 --> 33:22.366
just know that
I will be rooting for you.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.634
And if you choose me back...

33:28.407 --> 33:31.208
- I heard that you wanted
to go in.

33:31.276 --> 33:33.643
- I prefer to play alone.

33:33.712 --> 33:37.247
But Josh told me,
"Don't go in."

33:37.316 --> 33:40.717
- So I do like you go
in tomorrow,

33:40.786 --> 33:44.388
likely against Gabo,
you got to be ready,

33:44.456 --> 33:47.157
you run the risk,
you come back--

33:47.226 --> 33:49.793
- You pick somebody strong,
and we run this [bleep].

33:49.862 --> 33:51.261
The best thing for me

33:51.330 --> 33:53.230
is for you to have
a strong partner.

33:53.298 --> 33:55.532
- I think it's good
to go against Gabo

33:55.601 --> 33:59.069
because Gabo is not good
in a lot of things.

33:59.138 --> 34:02.539
So I have a lot of
possibilities to win that.

34:02.608 --> 34:05.809
- That's the plan.
- Yeah.

34:05.878 --> 34:09.112
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

34:09.181 --> 34:12.949
- So Logan's thinking about it
because he then

34:13.018 --> 34:15.052
gets to pick his partner.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.586
It's essentially--

34:16.655 --> 34:18.288
- He's gonna go in
sooner or later.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.023
- And he says,
"I prefer to play alone."

34:20.092 --> 34:24.027
- If Logan wants to go in,
I'm not stopping him.

34:24.096 --> 34:27.431
Go on, Logan.
Better you than me, buddy.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.568
'Cause he wants to go in.
Boom, my hands are clean.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.503

Well done, veterans.
Well done.

34:45.084 --> 34:46.583
- This is great
how it's working out.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.418
- They're starting to
nominate themselves.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.754
- Yeah.
- Okay, which is great.

34:50.823 --> 34:52.823
- Do they realize
there's no skull twist?

34:52.891 --> 34:54.458
[laughter]

34:59.731 --> 35:01.865

- Whoo!

35:01.934 --> 35:03.433
[laughs]

35:03.502 --> 35:06.036
- Best party of the year.

35:06.105 --> 35:09.573
- Yeah!

35:12.911 --> 35:14.744
- Ahh.

35:17.182 --> 35:18.748
<i> - Logan is a good kisser.</i>

35:18.817 --> 35:21.885
Logan is a very talented man.

35:21.954 --> 35:24.688
He's very good
at using his hands.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.823
Oh, my God.
I said too much now.

35:28.994 --> 35:30.527
Can we scrap that?

35:30.596 --> 35:35.432
- Big T is like
an octopus in the bed.

35:35.501 --> 35:39.069
But I said that
she used the tentacles.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.470
- [chuckles]

35:49.081 --> 35:52.182
- You're quite the chef.
That salad's quite good.

35:57.122 --> 35:59.956
- Mmm, it's not bad.
- It's healthy.

36:00.025 --> 36:02.526
- Mm-hmm.

36:02.594 --> 36:04.528
- What's going on
with you guys then?

36:04.596 --> 36:07.597
Is it like a relationship?
Is it sexual?

36:07.666 --> 36:09.766
Is it--what's going on?

36:09.835 --> 36:13.470
Them two together
are hilarious.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.939
Big T's like,
"Hey, Logan,

36:16.008 --> 36:18.909
I would love to get
in your undergarments."

36:18.977 --> 36:20.143
And Logan's like,

36:20.212 --> 36:22.679
"Hey, Big T, I just want
to play puzzles all day.

36:22.748 --> 36:26.216
I don't want to get
in your undergarments."

36:26.285 --> 36:28.952
- You're such a dick, Kyle.

36:29.021 --> 36:31.621
- Do you like Logan?
- I like everyone.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.123
- Obviously.
- Wow.

36:33.192 --> 36:34.724
- I mean, he is pretty sexy,
isn't he?

36:34.793 --> 36:37.561
- I like everyone
apart from you.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.633
<i> - Why are you mad at me?</i>

36:43.702 --> 36:45.869
- Because it's the same thing.
I'm immature.

36:45.938 --> 36:48.138
I'm acting like a child.
- Are you not? Are you not?

36:48.207 --> 36:49.973
- So you guys discredit
everything that I say,

36:50.042 --> 36:52.075
you and Fess have constantly
discredited in this game...

36:52.144 --> 36:54.511
- That is not true.
- When all I do is play for us.

36:54.580 --> 36:55.912
I don't play for me.

36:55.981 --> 36:58.014
It would be much easier
if I played for Josh.

36:58.083 --> 37:00.250
I don't play for Josh, I play
for you, for the three of us.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.785
- Are you kidding me?

37:01.853 --> 37:03.620
Dude, you're taking this way
too [bleep] personally.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.021
Your thing is just all
about you, you, you.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.856
- It's not about me.
- Yes.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.858
As much as you say
it's not, it is.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.493
- It's not about me.
- You're right, you're right.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.761
So you know you what,

37:11.830 --> 37:13.330
you can do your own thing
this game, fine.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.865
You do your own thing in this
game and best of luck to you.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.767
Best of luck to you.
I love you. I care about you.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.636
But it's--I'm done.
I'm over it.

37:19.705 --> 37:20.937
- So am I.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.439
- I'm over it.
So good luck to you.

37:22.507 --> 37:23.540
- Good luck to you too.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.041
<i> - Josh is my brother.</i>

37:25.110 --> 37:28.345
But damn, like, he really
cannot control his emotions.

37:28.413 --> 37:32.315
And so when he's going off and
throwing this tantrum, look,

37:32.384 --> 37:34.184
I'm not gonna sit here
and keep wasting my breath

37:34.253 --> 37:36.119
and my energy trying
to calm you down, dude.

37:36.188 --> 37:37.854
We're done. We're done.
We're done.

37:37.923 --> 37:38.922
No more conversation
the rest of the season.

37:38.991 --> 37:40.357
- I don't need to talk to you.

37:40.425 --> 37:41.958
- Hey, you tell me
that one time, it's good to go.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.994
<i> - It's about time I stopped</i>
<i> putting people before me</i>

37:44.062 --> 37:45.829
<i> in this game</i>
<i> and I start playing for me</i>

37:45.897 --> 37:47.497
<i> and I start playing</i>
<i> for my family</i>

37:47.566 --> 37:48.999
<i> and focus on why I'm here.</i>

37:49.067 --> 37:51.368
I have the strongest
support team back home.

37:51.436 --> 37:54.671
I think that no matter
how many people are against me,

37:54.740 --> 37:56.273
I feel like
the luckiest person

37:56.341 --> 37:59.075
because my family

We're gonna try to keep the

For one, we have one person

Ideally, if the moon and the
stars were to align with us.

38:49.594 --> 38:51.561
If Logan, from
what I understand,

38:51.630 --> 38:53.063
if he was the house vote

38:53.131 --> 38:55.098
and he wanted to go down

38:56.935 --> 38:58.868
So any girl,
no girl is going down with him.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.271

around headquarters

39:01.340 --> 39:04.641
that there's probably only
gonna be a male elimination

- I really don't want to
see Logan go down to the Lair

39:15.520 --> 39:18.988
because, historically,
when you send yourself down,

39:19.057 --> 39:21.291
you do tend to go home.

39:21.360 --> 39:24.060
- I want to go down, yes,
it is the truth

39:24.129 --> 39:25.862

to pick my partner,

39:25.931 --> 39:27.330

39:27.399 --> 39:30.333
But I don't want
to be the house vote

39:30.402 --> 39:33.503
because if I am
the house vote,

39:33.572 --> 39:37.841
then I don't know
if you are gonna send Gabo.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.147
- I'm sending Gabo.
- We're sending Gabo.

39:44.216 --> 39:47.083
- He wants to go in,
so absolutely.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.952
- No, but when we say
your name here right now,

39:49.020 --> 39:50.420
we will not change it.

39:50.489 --> 39:52.956
- We have no reason
to screw anybody over.

39:53.024 --> 39:55.024
I'm not gonna do that
to myself or my partner.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.260
- But it's safer--it's safer
for me to do it the other way.

39:57.329 --> 39:59.462
- This is as good
as it's gonna get, Logan.

39:59.531 --> 40:00.630
You know you're going in,

40:00.699 --> 40:01.965
you know who you're
going against,

40:02.033 --> 40:03.867
you know
it's gonna be one on one.

40:03.935 --> 40:05.702
- This is the best you can--
- I mean, that's--

40:05.771 --> 40:07.771
- I also think
we're making this

40:07.839 --> 40:10.039
harder than it should be
because CT is literally

40:10.108 --> 40:12.175
telling us he wants the path
of least resistance.

40:12.244 --> 40:14.177
He's putting this out
in the open.

40:14.246 --> 40:17.113
So if he goes against that,
that's gonna [bleep] his game,

40:17.182 --> 40:19.849
which I don't think
he wants to do

40:19.918 --> 40:22.485
because everybody
has been playing such a, like,

40:22.554 --> 40:24.220
straightforward game,
for the most part so far--

40:24.289 --> 40:26.055
- Really? [scoffs]

40:26.124 --> 40:28.057
- Really?
A straightforward game?

40:28.126 --> 40:29.325
[laughs]
Really?

40:29.394 --> 40:30.827

- Really?

40:30.896 --> 40:32.262
- We're gonna talk about
this again right now?

40:32.330 --> 40:33.797
- No, we'll talk later.
- Okay. Okay.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.965
- But I just want
to make that clear.

40:36.034 --> 40:38.301
Did that really just come
out of your mouth, Fessy?

40:38.370 --> 40:39.969
<i> A clean game?</i>

40:40.038 --> 40:42.439
You out of all people
are the last person

40:42.507 --> 40:46.042
that needs to speak
about a clean game.

40:48.079 --> 40:49.712
- Gabo, I have a question
for you, if that's okay.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.214
- Sure.

40:51.283 --> 40:53.583
- As somebody who has
voted themselves in in the past

40:53.652 --> 40:56.186
and lost, like, there's a risk
that comes with going in.

40:56.254 --> 40:58.121
Like, why do you
want to go in?

40:58.190 --> 41:00.857
- Right now,
my position is not easy.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.660
I have a partner Emy.
She's an amazing partner.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.728
But she's a rookie too.

41:05.797 --> 41:09.132
So this partnership
is dangerous.

41:09.201 --> 41:11.100
- You don't want to be
in a rookie-rookie pair.

41:11.169 --> 41:12.435
