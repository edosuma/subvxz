01:55.088 --> 01:56.220
Don't forget a
journalist's job is to

01:56.222 --> 01:57.424
uncover the truth.

01:58.157 --> 02:01.628
Not to give his damn opinion!

02:03.196 --> 02:04.564
Always remember that!

02:09.634 --> 02:10.470
Class dismissed.

02:24.517 --> 02:26.016
Why does he do that
with the yelling?

02:26.018 --> 02:28.019
Doesn't he know he scares
the shit out of people?

02:28.021 --> 02:30.087
I think that's why he does it.

02:30.089 --> 02:31.990
He's good, but he's out there.

02:31.992 --> 02:33.491
Well, when you're
the next Lisa Ling

02:33.493 --> 02:34.125
I guess he'll take it.

02:34.127 --> 02:35.627
Yeah, right.

02:35.629 --> 02:36.861
Maybe.

02:36.863 --> 02:38.729
So do we know what
story we're doin'?

02:38.731 --> 02:40.565
No, but I'll figure it out.

02:40.567 --> 02:42.067
Shouldn't we know by now?

02:42.069 --> 02:45.503
Listen, have I ever let
you down in four years?

02:45.505 --> 02:46.537
You have not.

02:46.539 --> 02:47.174
Hmm.

02:48.808 --> 02:50.275
Ah, all right, I gotta go.

02:50.277 --> 02:52.176
I'm running late
for my yoga class.

02:52.178 --> 02:53.678
Doin' yoga now?

02:53.680 --> 02:54.812
[Samantha] Yeah,
you're always telling me

02:54.814 --> 02:55.883
I need to relax more.

02:57.818 --> 02:58.653
Namaste.

03:00.254 --> 03:03.925
(soft instrumental music)

03:31.083 --> 03:34.686
(camera clicking)

03:34.688 --> 03:35.990
So how's Georgia?

03:38.124 --> 03:39.223
Good.

03:39.225 --> 03:41.062
And how's the little princess?

03:41.928 --> 03:44.265
Oh, pre-K, how is that possible?

03:46.732 --> 03:49.003
I should be there
right after graduation.

03:51.237 --> 03:53.508
I know, it's CNN.

03:54.775 --> 03:56.711
I don't think it gets any
more exciting than that.

03:59.913 --> 04:03.250
No, I don't think I'll be working
with Anderson right away.

04:06.218 --> 04:07.686
Yeah, well I won't be
going anywhere until

04:07.688 --> 04:09.654
I figure out what I'm
doing this damn story

04:09.656 --> 04:10.758
on for my thesis.

04:12.325 --> 04:15.025
(sighing)

04:15.027 --> 04:16.760
I know.

04:16.762 --> 04:18.031
I miss you too, Aunt Deb.

04:20.099 --> 04:21.999
Yeah, soon I will
see you and Miss Ava

04:22.000 --> 04:23.537
on a regular basis.

04:25.171 --> 04:25.972
I love you, too.

04:34.181 --> 04:36.784
They should just go ahead
and cut it down already.

04:37.784 --> 04:39.017
Where is this?

04:39.019 --> 04:41.318
Oak Hammock Park,
right over there.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.054
Oh yeah, I know
where that park is.

04:43.056 --> 04:45.390
Deep in the woods
there's this devil's tree.

04:45.392 --> 04:47.224
Lot of people have died there.

04:47.226 --> 04:48.328
Sounds ominous.

04:49.895 --> 04:51.261
Why are they deciding
whether to cut it down now?

04:51.263 --> 04:53.297
Damn kids keep goin'
there and killin'

04:53.299 --> 04:55.232
rabbits or some shit.

04:55.234 --> 04:56.570
It's just not a good place.

04:59.640 --> 05:00.274
Huh.

05:01.407 --> 05:03.274
Interesting.

05:14.154 --> 05:15.186
(kitten meowing)

05:15.188 --> 05:16.022
Oh.

05:18.190 --> 05:19.726
Hello.

05:20.661 --> 05:21.362
Hey.

05:22.796 --> 05:24.231
Where's your mommy?

05:25.298 --> 05:26.334
Hey.

05:27.299 --> 05:30.236
(kitten meowing)

05:31.438 --> 05:34.108
(ominous music)

05:48.688 --> 05:50.321
(kitten meowing)

05:50.323 --> 05:52.123
Hey, listen.

05:52.125 --> 05:53.691
You stay here, okay?

05:53.693 --> 05:56.126
I'm gonna leave
the car on for you.

05:56.128 --> 05:57.297
Be right back.

06:18.484 --> 06:22.657
(ominous music)
(wind howling)

06:33.166 --> 06:36.170
(crickets chirping)

06:40.507 --> 06:43.210
(bird cawing)

06:45.145 --> 06:49.315
(ominous music)
(wind howling)

07:17.811 --> 07:20.815
(crickets chirping)

07:39.532 --> 07:42.333
(birds cawing)

07:42.335 --> 07:45.339
(creepy whispering)

07:58.484 --> 08:00.518
(ominous music)

08:00.520 --> 08:02.890
(gasping)

08:04.825 --> 08:05.590
(twig snapping)

08:05.592 --> 08:07.491
Excuse me, miss.

08:07.493 --> 08:10.227
You left your car running
and there's a kitten inside.

08:10.229 --> 08:11.429
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

08:11.431 --> 08:13.200
I just wanted to
check this tree out.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.900
Yeah, you and every kid.

08:16.902 --> 08:17.938
What happened here?

08:19.371 --> 08:21.407
Well, some people died here.

08:22.575 --> 08:24.075
I don't know why the
city allows people

08:24.077 --> 08:25.342
to come to a tree.

08:25.344 --> 08:27.511
Personally I'd like
to see it cut down.

08:27.513 --> 08:30.148
Has anyone died
since you worked here?

08:30.150 --> 08:31.519
What, are you a reporter?

08:32.485 --> 08:35.320
Well, yeah, actually
I'm studying to be.

08:35.322 --> 08:36.354
Look, I don't
mean to sound rude.

08:36.356 --> 08:39.323
I just don't want anything
else happening here.

08:39.326 --> 08:40.394
So then you have.

08:42.562 --> 08:44.561
Just don't come here alone.

08:44.563 --> 08:46.065
Always come with a friend.

08:48.034 --> 08:49.202
I always have mine.

08:53.139 --> 08:54.140
Thank you.

08:56.009 --> 08:57.207
Bye.

08:57.209 --> 08:58.044
Bye.

09:04.516 --> 09:07.887
(soft dramatic music)

09:44.591 --> 09:48.426
(muffled screaming)

09:48.428 --> 09:50.130
All right, my
little bimbolinas.

09:51.597 --> 09:52.433
Tell me.

09:54.100 --> 09:57.271
Which one of you has a date
with the skinning knife first?

09:58.138 --> 10:00.271
[Girl] Not me.

10:00.273 --> 10:02.941
Oh, then it's you.

10:02.943 --> 10:03.877
Lucky girl.

10:08.548 --> 10:10.681
(clothes ripping)

10:10.683 --> 10:14.418
(muffled screaming)

10:14.420 --> 10:15.255
It's okay.

10:17.590 --> 10:20.594
(muffled screaming)

10:22.661 --> 10:23.897
It's okay.

10:25.698 --> 10:27.133
You're allowed to scream.

10:28.201 --> 10:30.067
I'm sure this hurts.

10:30.069 --> 10:31.702
(muffled screaming)

10:31.704 --> 10:33.073
You, on the other hand,

10:35.342 --> 10:37.642
haven't any reason to cry yet.

10:37.644 --> 10:38.611
I haven't even touched you.

10:41.146 --> 10:44.681
(muffled screaming)

10:44.683 --> 10:47.553
(knife slicing)

10:51.624 --> 10:52.623
There.

10:52.625 --> 10:54.124
Now you can cry.

10:54.126 --> 10:56.994
(laughing)

10:56.996 --> 10:57.931
Oh, wait.

10:58.999 --> 10:59.633
You can't.

11:01.067 --> 11:03.871
(muffled screaming)

11:07.741 --> 11:11.111
(soft dramatic music)

11:41.341 --> 11:43.043
I was accused of
killing 34 women.

11:44.376 --> 11:45.712
Come up with 34 names.

11:47.112 --> 11:49.781
[Interviewer] What
were you convicted of?

11:49.783 --> 11:51.284
Was convicted of killing two.

11:52.117 --> 11:53.020
Fort Pierce.

11:58.757 --> 12:02.159
[Newswoman] We're standing
here with Officer John Harris.

12:02.161 --> 12:04.362
Officer, you were
one of the first to

12:04.364 --> 12:07.065
investigate this gruesome scene.

12:07.067 --> 12:10.133
Can you tell us anything
about what happened here?

12:10.135 --> 12:12.269
[John] Well, all
I can say is that

12:12.271 --> 12:14.504
we're fortunate we were
able to catch this guy,

12:14.506 --> 12:16.441
but I'm gonna urge
people not to come out

12:16.443 --> 12:18.676
here under any circumstances.

12:18.678 --> 12:20.077
[Newswoman] I assume
that's because this is

12:20.079 --> 12:22.180
an active crime scene?

12:22.182 --> 12:25.052
[John] Well,
it's just not safe.

12:26.586 --> 12:29.757
(soft dramatic music)

12:34.526 --> 12:37.597
(machine sputtering)

12:38.731 --> 12:40.864
I mean, it's not bad.

12:40.866 --> 12:42.800
I remember hearing something
about this when I was a kid,

12:42.802 --> 12:45.503
but I didn't know this
shit really happened.

12:45.505 --> 12:47.104
Well, I've lived
here for 15 years

12:47.106 --> 12:48.275
and I've never heard of it.

12:49.375 --> 12:50.575
How'd you find the officer?

12:50.577 --> 12:51.645
I found him online.

12:53.313 --> 12:54.845
I have his address.

12:54.847 --> 12:56.346
Now I just need to figure
out how to get ahold of him.

12:56.348 --> 12:57.550
[Rob] No phone number?

12:59.419 --> 13:00.685
Should we just go
by there tomorrow

13:00.687 --> 13:02.056
and see if he'll talk to us?

13:03.122 --> 13:03.790
Yeah, we could try.

13:06.292 --> 13:08.893
(knocking)

13:08.895 --> 13:09.994
If this guy answers the door,

13:09.996 --> 13:11.765
are we really gonna ask
him to film his interview?

13:12.866 --> 13:15.733
(dog barking)
(sirens wailing)

13:15.735 --> 13:17.268
(dramatic music)

13:17.270 --> 13:18.768
[John] Yeah, who are you?

13:18.770 --> 13:21.339
Hello, Mr. Harris?

13:21.341 --> 13:23.141
My name is Samantha
and this is Rob,

13:23.143 --> 13:24.774
and we're journalism
students doing

13:24.776 --> 13:27.814
a story on something you
investigated over 40 years ago.

13:30.850 --> 13:33.216
The devil's tree.

13:33.218 --> 13:33.853
Yes.

13:35.521 --> 13:36.888
No way.

13:36.890 --> 13:37.790
Forget it.

13:42.194 --> 13:43.594
I didn't think he
was gonna let us.

13:43.596 --> 13:44.762
I mean, call it a hunch,

13:44.764 --> 13:46.200
but he doesn't
seem very friendly.

13:49.302 --> 13:51.335
Look, I know everyone
called you crazy,

13:51.337 --> 13:53.303
and maybe you thought you were.

13:53.305 --> 13:54.307
I don't think so.

13:56.775 --> 13:57.611
Come on, Sam.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.850
What do you know
about the tree?

14:05.184 --> 14:06.786
No cameras.

14:08.254 --> 14:08.889
It's fine.

14:09.856 --> 14:10.857
All right.

14:12.925 --> 14:15.695
I thank you for talking
to us, Mr. Harris.

14:17.496 --> 14:18.799
You can call me John.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.699
I haven't talked about the tree

14:21.701 --> 14:23.670
in a very long time.

14:24.871 --> 14:26.369
Well, it means a lot.

14:26.371 --> 14:27.738
And who better than
one of the officers

14:27.740 --> 14:29.342
who investigated what happened.

14:30.577 --> 14:32.479
I'm not a cop anymore.

14:33.579 --> 14:34.747
It made sure of that.

14:36.982 --> 14:38.217
What did?

14:39.986 --> 14:42.789
Nobody knows the
truth about that tree.

14:44.691 --> 14:45.690
Do you?

14:45.692 --> 14:47.258
Help me understand.

14:47.260 --> 14:48.462
I felt something there.

14:50.963 --> 14:52.565
You've been to the tree?

14:54.634 --> 14:55.999
I have.

14:56.001 --> 14:57.303
You didn't tell me that.

14:58.337 --> 14:59.737
Tell me.

14:59.739 --> 15:01.575
What did you feel
when you were there?

15:05.010 --> 15:05.877
I don't really know.

15:05.879 --> 15:09.547
I felt like I heard
voices talking,

15:09.549 --> 15:12.685
like I felt someone there.

15:13.720 --> 15:14.555
Mmm.

15:15.688 --> 15:17.758
Someone or something?

15:19.759 --> 15:21.327
What do you mean something?

15:23.895 --> 15:24.829
If you've been to the tree,

15:24.831 --> 15:26.696
you shouldn't even be here.

15:26.698 --> 15:28.965
Listen, tell me what
you're talking about.

15:28.967 --> 15:29.937
Maybe I can help.

15:34.539 --> 15:37.211
(door creaking)

15:40.446 --> 15:42.549
He better not come
out there with a gun.

15:45.385 --> 15:49.320
(soft dramatic music)

15:49.322 --> 15:49.954
Maybe we should go.

15:49.956 --> 15:50.955
Hold on.

15:50.957 --> 15:53.891
(clattering)

15:53.893 --> 15:54.728
Mr. Harris?

15:56.428 --> 15:58.796
(door creaking)

15:58.798 --> 16:01.500
(dramatic music)

16:06.005 --> 16:06.840
What's this?

16:07.973 --> 16:10.340
You said you wanted to
know about the investigation

16:10.342 --> 16:11.344
out at the tree.

16:12.944 --> 16:16.479
That's the film footage I
took of the crime scene.

16:16.481 --> 16:17.317
Take it.

16:18.617 --> 16:20.450
I'm officially off the case.

16:20.452 --> 16:21.255
Go on.

16:23.755 --> 16:24.857
Come on, let's go.

16:28.995 --> 16:31.561
Holy shit, did that
dude creep me out.

16:31.563 --> 16:34.668
What do you think he
was even talkin' about?

16:36.336 --> 16:37.468
[Samantha] I don't
know, but I'm interested

16:37.470 --> 16:39.273
in finding out, that's for sure.

16:40.372 --> 16:42.008
It's cool he
gave you the film.

16:44.110 --> 16:44.978
[Samantha] It was.

16:47.079 --> 16:48.648
What, what's the matter?

16:50.717 --> 16:51.882
Nothing.

16:51.884 --> 16:53.520
I'm just thinking about
something he said.

16:56.555 --> 16:57.888
Let's go to the park.

16:57.890 --> 16:59.389
You got your camera?

16:59.391 --> 17:00.660
Let's go get some footage.

17:03.962 --> 17:06.967
(suspenseful music)

17:20.380 --> 17:22.012
[Man] You are most prompt.

17:22.013 --> 17:22.848
Mom, mop up.

17:24.516 --> 17:26.117
We will speak in
one of the languages

17:26.118 --> 17:28.017
of the earth people.

17:28.019 --> 17:30.454
I have orders to send
you on a special mission

17:30.456 --> 17:31.558
to the planet Earth.

17:34.659 --> 17:37.596
(static crackling)

17:41.167 --> 17:44.036
(skin sizzling)

17:53.780 --> 17:56.450
(ominous music)

18:02.755 --> 18:05.058
(gun cocking)

18:08.060 --> 18:10.464
(gun firing)

18:11.430 --> 18:14.367
(dramatic music)

18:17.469 --> 18:19.905
(gun firing)

18:21.541 --> 18:24.378
(blood trickling)

18:27.746 --> 18:30.917
(soft dramatic music)

19:00.580 --> 19:01.811
[Rob] Honestly, Sam.

19:01.813 --> 19:03.214
What do you think is
going on at this tree?

19:03.216 --> 19:04.349
[Samantha] I don't know.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.516
But when I was here the
other day, I felt something.

19:06.518 --> 19:08.619
Like someone was watching me.

19:08.621 --> 19:10.157
And you know me,
I'm not like that.

19:11.490 --> 19:12.956
And I thought I heard
people whispering.

19:12.958 --> 19:15.725
Like they were talking
about me being here.

19:15.727 --> 19:18.061
What do you mean
talking about you?

19:18.063 --> 19:19.263
Like ghosts?

19:19.265 --> 19:21.031
Like what are we
talking about here?

19:21.033 --> 19:23.203
In the sound of
bugs I heard whispers.

19:25.571 --> 19:27.071
Listen, I'll admit
this is interesting,

19:27.073 --> 19:31.007
but this kind of
stuff freaks me out.

19:31.009 --> 19:32.642
Well, can you
imagine if we're able

19:32.644 --> 19:35.212
to really find out
what's going on here?

19:35.214 --> 19:37.117
Isn't that how
horror movies begin?

19:41.120 --> 19:41.955
Whoa.

19:43.121 --> 19:44.655
Just want me to get
some B roll of the tree?

19:44.657 --> 19:46.256
Yeah, grab some
shots of the tree alone

19:46.258 --> 19:48.058
and then some with
me standing near it.

19:48.060 --> 19:49.062
All right.

19:54.734 --> 19:56.266
(leaves rustling)

19:56.268 --> 19:57.100
What?

19:57.102 --> 19:57.938
What is it?

19:59.138 --> 20:01.073
Nothing, I thought
I heard something.

20:04.274 --> 20:05.943
All right, go
stand by the tree.

20:05.945 --> 20:07.011
If you're brave enough.

20:07.013 --> 20:07.848
Stop.

20:09.215 --> 20:10.080
I think all these horrific
acts happened here,

20:10.082 --> 20:12.182
but all the folklore
around the tree

20:12.184 --> 20:13.783
has been blown
out of proportion.

20:13.785 --> 20:14.717
Yeah?

20:14.719 --> 20:15.588
Tell that to old man Harris.

20:18.224 --> 20:20.057
Uh.

20:20.059 --> 20:20.957
Damn it.

20:20.959 --> 20:22.225
That fuckin' hurt.

20:22.227 --> 20:22.760
[Samantha] Oh my
God, are you okay?

20:22.762 --> 20:23.694
Yeah.

20:23.696 --> 20:25.165
Just hope the camera's okay.

20:26.998 --> 20:28.165
Oh, thank God.

20:28.167 --> 20:29.233
How did you fall?

20:29.235 --> 20:30.270
I don't know.

20:31.637 --> 20:33.803
I couldn't see
where I was goin'.

20:33.805 --> 20:34.605
Look, can we get out of here?

20:34.607 --> 20:35.238
It's gettin' dark.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.274
Yeah, we can go.

20:38.578 --> 20:40.077
You sure you're okay?

20:40.079 --> 20:41.244
Yeah, I'm fine.

20:41.246 --> 20:43.216
I just wanna get
out of these woods.

20:44.850 --> 20:47.521
(ominous music)

20:50.922 --> 20:53.592
(water running)

21:20.352 --> 21:24.323
(clock ticking)
(dramatic music)

21:32.931 --> 21:37.102
(door creaking)
(dramatic music)

21:46.978 --> 21:47.813
Denzel?

21:49.281 --> 21:51.217
Can you do me a huge favor
and convert this for me?

21:53.252 --> 21:54.087
Thank you.

21:57.723 --> 22:00.694
(suspenseful music)

22:10.669 --> 22:11.668
[Samantha] I believe
all these horrific

22:11.670 --> 22:13.837
acts happened here, but
I think all the folklore

22:13.839 --> 22:16.072
around the tree has been
blown out of proportion.

22:16.074 --> 22:16.909
Yeah?

22:17.842 --> 22:20.846
(suspenseful music)

22:32.957 --> 22:33.890
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:33.892 --> 22:36.025
I just hope the camera's okay.

22:36.027 --> 22:37.197
Oh, thank God.

22:40.099 --> 22:43.102
(suspenseful music)

22:55.346 --> 22:56.382
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:58.383 --> 22:59.218
Wait.

23:00.386 --> 23:03.419
(suspenseful music)

23:03.421 --> 23:04.757
Wait a minute.

23:05.757 --> 23:08.761
(suspenseful music)

23:13.998 --> 23:15.334
What the fuck?

23:19.371 --> 23:21.373
Oh my God, this can't be.

23:28.980 --> 23:31.817
(camera clicking)

23:36.287 --> 23:37.723
Show me yours first.

23:39.492 --> 23:40.389
(gasping)

23:40.391 --> 23:42.326
Oh my God, look!

23:42.328 --> 23:43.761
It's him!

23:43.763 --> 23:44.762
And you can't see
it in this picture,

23:44.764 --> 23:47.063
but it even has the same
black spot on the tree.

23:47.065 --> 23:48.331
How is this possible?

23:48.333 --> 23:49.766
I mean, look at the detail.

23:49.768 --> 23:51.769
You can see his face,
his clothes, everything.

23:51.771 --> 23:53.904
Looks like he's from the
'40s or '50s or something.

23:53.906 --> 23:56.874
I mean clearly it's
the same kid, but how?

23:56.876 --> 23:59.408
And what is that black
spot on the tree?

23:59.410 --> 24:00.343
I don't know.

24:00.345 --> 24:02.111
Maybe the tree is cursed?

24:02.113 --> 24:04.148
The kid's a ghost
probably trapped there?

24:04.150 --> 24:05.549
I mean, what other
explanation is there?

24:05.551 --> 24:07.150
Like Professor Simon says,

24:07.152 --> 24:09.485
it's our job to find the
truth, not our opinion.

24:09.487 --> 24:11.388
Well, it's my
opinion that the truth

24:11.390 --> 24:14.124
is that there's something
evil at that tree.

24:14.126 --> 24:15.559
I mean, look at my arm.

24:15.561 --> 24:16.959
Can you explain this?

24:16.961 --> 24:18.861
What happened to your arm?

24:18.863 --> 24:20.263
From when you fell?

24:20.265 --> 24:21.868
What does it look like to you?

24:22.901 --> 24:23.870
A bullseye.

24:24.536 --> 24:26.369
Does it hurt?

24:26.371 --> 24:29.473
Not really, but
it's getting worse.

24:29.475 --> 24:31.375
And I think old man
Harris has a scar

24:31.377 --> 24:32.876
on his arm, too.

24:32.878 --> 24:35.115
What, now you have
the same scar as him?

24:37.448 --> 24:38.881
I can't believe
I'm sayin' this,

24:38.883 --> 24:42.855
but I think we need to
go back and talk to him.

24:43.455 --> 24:44.321
I agree.

24:44.323 --> 24:45.958
None of this is
making sense to me.

24:51.496 --> 24:53.296
He died?

24:53.298 --> 24:54.298
What?

24:54.300 --> 24:55.933
You've got to be kidding me.

24:55.935 --> 24:56.770
Does it say how?

24:58.102 --> 24:59.505
No, no it doesn't.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.413
Excuse me, ma'am.

25:09.415 --> 25:11.615
Do you know what
happened to Mr. Harris?

25:11.617 --> 25:12.983
Yeah.

25:12.985 --> 25:14.917
He blew his head off.

25:14.919 --> 25:16.890
Cops have been
here for two days.

25:18.023 --> 25:20.092
Weren't you guys
here the other day?

25:21.861 --> 25:22.827
Yeah.

25:22.829 --> 25:24.297
We're just journalists
working on a story.

25:25.496 --> 25:26.332
Thank you.

25:32.504 --> 25:33.469
[Samantha] There has
to be something here

25:33.471 --> 25:35.574
about a missing boy
from the '40s or '50s

25:36.507 --> 25:38.207
in this area.

25:38.209 --> 25:40.476
You think you're gonna
find out who this boy is?

25:40.478 --> 25:41.878
This is crazy.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.013
If you want to
look something up,

25:43.015 --> 25:45.415
look up what this mark means.

25:45.417 --> 25:47.149
Look, there has
to be an explanation

25:47.151 --> 25:48.651
for all of this.

25:48.653 --> 25:51.890
Even your bullseye, which
I'll admit is pretty weird.

25:55.393 --> 25:56.428
Wait, look at this.

25:58.429 --> 26:00.563
The bullseye symbol has
appeared on people in the past

26:00.565 --> 26:02.901
and has been associated
with the devil.

26:03.902 --> 26:04.836
Some have received the mark

26:04.838 --> 26:07.140
and not too shortly
died or were killed?

26:10.074 --> 26:10.974
Oh my God, Rob.

26:10.976 --> 26:11.608
Look!

26:11.610 --> 26:12.846
It's him!

26:14.380 --> 26:15.380
Holy shit!

26:16.547 --> 26:18.215
How?

26:18.217 --> 26:20.082
Told you I'd find something.

26:20.084 --> 26:21.551
Benjamin Munson, age eight,

26:21.553 --> 26:24.620
disappeared walking home
from school on October 15th.

26:24.622 --> 26:26.356
A neighborhood
search was conducted

26:26.358 --> 26:28.358
in the area for three
days before the search

26:28.360 --> 26:30.359
was called off.

26:30.361 --> 26:32.396
Fears that something
more sinister happened,

26:32.398 --> 26:34.932
as his body was never recovered.

26:34.934 --> 26:36.198
But certain items
of his were found

26:36.200 --> 26:37.501
along the road where
he was believed

26:37.503 --> 26:38.605
to have been abducted.

26:40.339 --> 26:43.909
Rob, I think he was
killed at the tree.

26:45.678 --> 26:46.510
I don't know what to say.

26:46.512 --> 26:47.347
I think you're right.

26:48.281 --> 26:49.713
What if you're right
and something evil

26:49.715 --> 26:51.580
is there and has
trapped all the victims

26:51.582 --> 26:53.085
of those who've been murdered?

26:55.720 --> 26:56.686
I need to eat.

26:56.688 --> 26:57.923
You hungry?

27:01.192 --> 27:02.391
You have to see this.

27:02.393 --> 27:03.560
All these kids and
other people have gone

27:03.562 --> 27:05.329
to the tree and filmed it.

27:05.331 --> 27:06.495
[Rob] Yeah?

27:06.497 --> 27:08.365
What are they doing
in the videos?

27:08.367 --> 27:11.100
[Samantha] Mostly
just playing around.

27:11.102 --> 27:14.236
Where there was a
double homicide in 1971

27:14.238 --> 27:15.440
from Gerard Shaefer.

27:16.574 --> 27:18.975
We've been dared to spend
the night here, the night.

27:18.977 --> 27:20.243
(laughing)

27:20.245 --> 27:21.978
The girl was tied
up right here, man.

27:21.980 --> 27:23.213
Right here.

27:23.215 --> 27:24.680
Hey, now that we
know who the kid is,

27:24.682 --> 27:27.250
I'd like to try and
communicate with him.

27:27.252 --> 27:29.656
I feel like that's what
I felt when I was there.

27:31.422 --> 27:32.621
You know, Sam.

27:32.623 --> 27:35.559
When I chose to become
a cameraman journalist,

27:35.561 --> 27:37.727
I kind of pictured
myself scalin' a volcano

27:37.729 --> 27:41.764
with Nat Geo or possibly
covering a third world country.

27:41.766 --> 27:43.532
I didn't think I'd
be summoning spirits

27:43.534 --> 27:45.401
and playing Shaggy and Scooby.

27:45.403 --> 27:46.436
Oh, nice.

27:46.438 --> 27:48.671
Are you calling me a dog now?

27:48.673 --> 27:49.507
No, I just,

27:51.075 --> 27:52.141
I don't know how I
feel about all this.

27:52.143 --> 27:53.409
That's all.

27:53.411 --> 27:57.546
Well, think of it as
uncovering the truth.

27:57.548 --> 27:58.682
When I was at my yoga
studio the other day,

27:58.684 --> 28:01.051
there was a sign up that
said learn to speak spirit.

28:01.053 --> 28:02.551
(ominous music)

28:02.553 --> 28:04.323
Like those people could maybe
help us with that, you know?

28:05.591 --> 28:06.726
Hey, are you listening?

28:10.228 --> 28:11.229
Yeah, I heard you.

28:13.665 --> 28:15.799
Ooh, this looks good.

28:15.801 --> 28:16.733
[Rob] Uh-huh.

28:16.735 --> 28:17.533
Maybe you should become a chef

28:17.535 --> 28:18.801
instead of a cameraman.

28:18.803 --> 28:19.735
You know, stick with
what you're good at.

28:19.737 --> 28:21.103
Screw you.

28:21.105 --> 28:22.074
What else you find?

28:22.807 --> 28:25.141
Well, it looks
like in the '90s

28:25.143 --> 28:28.311
there was a girl who was abducted
along with her boyfriend.

28:28.313 --> 28:29.780
Yeah, and?

28:29.782 --> 28:31.180
Seems that they
were apparently used

28:31.182 --> 28:33.382
in some type of satanic ritual

28:33.384 --> 28:34.751
and somehow she
was forced to watch

28:34.753 --> 28:36.621
her boyfriend get
brutally murdered.

28:39.624 --> 28:41.124
What are you doin'?

28:41.126 --> 28:42.626
I'm looking her up.

28:42.628 --> 28:45.227
See if I can find her like
I found Officer Harris.

28:45.229 --> 28:48.264
(ominous music)

28:48.266 --> 28:49.698
Found her!

28:49.700 --> 28:50.702
Damn, I'm good.

28:51.836 --> 28:54.206
(sighing)

28:55.640 --> 28:58.074
Hey, maybe you should go
talk to her by yourself.

28:58.076 --> 29:01.211
You probably won't need
a cameraman for this one.

29:01.213 --> 29:02.478
You okay?

29:02.480 --> 29:03.715
You're not givin'
up on me, are you?

29:05.217 --> 29:07.053
No, just tired.

29:08.086 --> 29:08.717
I'm gonna get some rest.

29:08.719 --> 29:09.619
You go.

29:09.621 --> 29:10.456
Okay.

29:11.723 --> 29:13.059
Hey, thanks for lunch.

29:14.092 --> 29:15.859
Next time I'll make it.

29:15.861 --> 29:17.359
You make lunch?

29:17.361 --> 29:18.695
I don't know.

29:18.697 --> 29:19.732
Wow, really?

29:21.233 --> 29:22.698
Call me when you're done.

29:22.700 --> 29:23.535
Okay.

29:29.740 --> 29:32.110
(sighing)

29:33.445 --> 29:37.116
(dog barking in background)

29:50.361 --> 29:52.598
(knocking)

29:58.504 --> 29:59.336
Who are you?

29:59.338 --> 30:00.904
And what do you want?

30:00.906 --> 30:01.771
Hello, ma'am.

30:01.773 --> 30:03.240
My name is Samantha.

30:03.242 --> 30:04.808
I'm an investigative
reporter looking to

30:04.810 --> 30:05.641
talk to Natalie.

30:05.643 --> 30:06.478
About what?

30:07.912 --> 30:10.348
About what happened in
those woods 20 years ago.

30:11.717 --> 30:14.751
We talked to all the
people we needed to talk to.

30:14.753 --> 30:16.418
That was a long time ago.

30:16.420 --> 30:17.320
You're right, you're right.

30:17.322 --> 30:18.487
I'm sorry.

30:18.489 --> 30:19.724
What was your name again?

30:21.826 --> 30:23.894
(sighing)

30:23.896 --> 30:24.730
Darcy.

30:27.498 --> 30:28.598
She's not right, either,

30:28.600 --> 30:30.900
so I'm afraid talkin' to
her won't do you any good.

30:30.902 --> 30:32.869
Well, if I understand
it correctly,

30:32.871 --> 30:36.205
many of the people
involved were never caught.

30:36.207 --> 30:37.807
This report could
lead to closure,

30:37.809 --> 30:39.245
possibly arrests.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.915
You got five minutes.

30:44.917 --> 30:45.849
That's it.

30:45.851 --> 30:47.184
Five minutes.

30:47.186 --> 30:47.951
Thank you.

30:47.953 --> 30:48.754
I think it will really help.

30:50.354 --> 30:51.256
[Darcy] Natalie?

30:52.291 --> 30:53.525
We got company.

30:54.525 --> 30:55.361
Come on in.

30:59.965 --> 31:02.334
(groaning)

31:03.334 --> 31:04.504
[Samantha] Oh, sorry.

31:15.613 --> 31:16.481
Natalie?

31:17.381 --> 31:18.548
This is someone who wants...

31:18.550 --> 31:19.485
Samantha.

31:25.923 --> 31:27.492
This is Samantha.

31:29.361 --> 31:31.597
She wanted to come by
and visit with you.

31:35.867 --> 31:37.904
She's never been the same since.

31:40.005 --> 31:43.572
I hate asking, but
would you be okay

31:43.574 --> 31:45.378
telling me what
happened that night?

31:48.647 --> 31:51.284
She was 17.

31:52.950 --> 31:55.520
Seeing this boy down the street.

31:58.724 --> 32:00.657
To me she was still my baby,

32:00.659 --> 32:04.796
but can't tell a
17-year-old nothin'.

32:07.431 --> 32:10.736
They had went to
the park that night,

32:12.004 --> 32:14.573
where they sat in his truck.

32:15.806 --> 32:17.439
(chuckles)

32:17.441 --> 32:19.878
I'm sure you can figure
out what they were doin'.

32:24.015 --> 32:25.951
That was the moment
everything changed.

32:27.552 --> 32:29.822
When are we gonna be
able to go to your house?

32:31.023 --> 32:32.455
Why do you want
to go to my house?

32:32.457 --> 32:33.689
We always talk about it.

32:33.691 --> 32:34.724
We always talk about
meeting your parents,

32:34.726 --> 32:35.628
always talk ab...

32:36.561 --> 32:38.494
(gasping)
(dramatic music)

32:38.496 --> 32:41.734
They dragged him to that tree

32:43.067 --> 32:44.803
where more of 'em were waitin'.

32:46.405 --> 32:48.638
All in black.

32:48.640 --> 32:49.472
(whimpering)

32:49.474 --> 32:52.544
Like real-life demons.

32:55.447 --> 32:58.316
She was stripped down.

32:59.851 --> 33:02.551
They tied her to
stakes in the ground.

33:02.553 --> 33:03.688
Can you imagine?

33:05.390 --> 33:06.990
(crying)

33:06.992 --> 33:09.725
Apparently they tied
her boyfriend to

33:09.727 --> 33:13.730
some sort of a rack

33:13.732 --> 33:15.301
directly on top of her.

33:17.968 --> 33:20.005
What they did to that poor kid.

33:20.971 --> 33:22.007
Oh my God.

33:23.975 --> 33:28.347
They cut him open
like some animal.

33:30.782 --> 33:34.551
Let him bleed out
onto my baby girl.

33:34.553 --> 33:36.889
(screaming)

33:40.859 --> 33:43.428
What kind of monsters
would do such a thing?

33:46.497 --> 33:47.766
What they did next to her

33:49.368 --> 33:51.337
is nothing short of horrific.

33:54.005 --> 33:57.310
As she lay covered in
this poor kid's blood,

33:58.944 --> 33:59.779
naked,

34:01.713 --> 34:02.915
tied to the ground.

34:04.850 --> 34:06.014
She was then...

34:06.016 --> 34:08.553
(screaming)

34:11.655 --> 34:13.722
Can't even say.

34:13.724 --> 34:16.061
(screaming)

34:19.063 --> 34:23.034
They left her with this
wonderful reminder.

34:26.036 --> 34:27.106
How was she found?

34:30.608 --> 34:32.377
They wrapped her
in a blanket and

34:33.177 --> 34:35.045
dumped her near the parkin' lot.

34:36.847 --> 34:39.951
The park ranger found
her in the mornin'.

34:42.186 --> 34:46.358
When the police went back
to the tree to investigate,

34:48.626 --> 34:50.527
there were no
traces of anything.

34:52.530 --> 34:55.063
Was she immediately like this?

34:55.065 --> 34:57.069
Unable to talk or interact?

34:58.702 --> 34:59.871
No, not immediately.

35:02.039 --> 35:05.707
Slowly over time,

35:05.709 --> 35:08.581
she became more despondent.

35:10.481 --> 35:13.749
She went through all
types of therapies,

35:13.751 --> 35:17.456
but nothin' worked.

35:19.457 --> 35:21.459
I have to ask
you this question,

35:22.093 --> 35:24.430
and it may sound weird but,

35:25.130 --> 35:27.099
did she ever mention
a little boy?

35:29.066 --> 35:29.869
No.

35:30.968 --> 35:31.800
No, she didn't.

35:31.802 --> 35:32.637
Why?

35:33.939 --> 35:35.174
He needed help.

35:38.209 --> 35:40.146
But nobody could help 'em.

35:42.881 --> 35:43.749
Who did, honey?

35:45.249 --> 35:47.485
This boy she's askin' about?

35:48.787 --> 35:50.790
Nobody could help 'em.

35:53.224 --> 35:56.594
(soft dramatic music)

36:04.602 --> 36:08.070
(kitten meowing)

36:08.072 --> 36:08.907
Hey.

36:13.878 --> 36:14.712
Hi.

36:16.581 --> 36:17.650
Watcha doin'?

36:26.291 --> 36:30.463
(water running)
(dramatic music)

37:05.664 --> 37:08.934
(creepy ominous music)

37:40.231 --> 37:42.601
(gasping)

37:50.608 --> 37:53.778
(soft dramatic music)

38:03.887 --> 38:06.791
(metal clattering)

38:13.764 --> 38:16.334
(dramatic music)

38:27.979 --> 38:28.814
Natalie?

38:30.648 --> 38:32.284
What are you doin' up?

38:33.284 --> 38:35.350
What is that?

38:35.352 --> 38:36.852
(knife slicing)

38:36.854 --> 38:41.025
(blood gurgling)
(gasping)

38:52.037 --> 38:56.207
(knife slicing)
(dramatic music)

39:07.151 --> 39:09.251
(body thudding)

39:09.253 --> 39:11.990
(dramatic music)

39:16.360 --> 39:19.297
(blood gurgling)

39:23.968 --> 39:27.206
(soft dramatic music)

39:59.838 --> 40:00.673
Hey!

40:02.372 --> 40:05.744
(soft dramatic music)

40:24.896 --> 40:25.731
Hey!

40:35.472 --> 40:37.709
(growling)

40:38.409 --> 40:41.380
(dramatic music)

40:47.785 --> 40:50.255
(phone ringing)

40:57.796 --> 40:58.827
[Samantha] Hey,
how you feelin'?

40:58.829 --> 41:00.863
You get any rest last night?

41:00.865 --> 41:02.164
[Rob] Not exactly.

41:02.166 --> 41:03.267
[Samantha] What's the matter?

41:04.269 --> 41:06.035
[Rob] I can't work on
the story anymore, Sam.

41:06.037 --> 41:06.869
Why?

41:06.871 --> 41:08.137
What happened?

41:08.139 --> 41:09.305
[Rob] Last night I
had a terrible dream

41:09.307 --> 41:11.506
and I think it was
whatever's at that tree.

41:11.508 --> 41:13.575
I saw the boy and
some kind of demon.

41:13.577 --> 41:15.945
[Samantha] In your dream?

41:15.947 --> 41:17.079
[Rob] Like I knew
it was a dream,

41:17.081 --> 41:18.314
but somethin' was different,

41:18.316 --> 41:20.816
like it was real
at the same time.

41:20.818 --> 41:23.051
Regardless, I can't
do this story anymore.

41:23.053 --> 41:24.153
It's affecting me too much.

41:24.155 --> 41:25.791
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

41:27.925 --> 41:30.193
Wait, I know some weird
shit has been happening,

41:30.195 --> 41:32.928
but don't you think it
was just a bad dream?

41:32.930 --> 41:34.564
I have bad dreams all the time.

41:34.566 --> 41:36.131
[Rob] Not like this.

41:36.133 --> 41:37.135
Sam, listen.

41:38.570 --> 41:40.001
I'm sorry.

41:40.003 --> 41:40.938
I gotta go.

41:41.606 --> 41:44.476
(phone beeping)

41:47.177 --> 41:50.348
(soft dramatic music)

42:04.494 --> 42:07.365
Well, the professor says
it's my job to find the truth.

42:15.606 --> 42:17.472
[Man] Hello,
this is Paranormal.

42:17.474 --> 42:18.341
Hi, yes.

42:18.343 --> 42:19.575
My name is Samantha.

42:19.577 --> 42:21.644
Where are you guys located?

42:21.646 --> 42:23.879
[Man] We're
based out of Miami.

42:23.881 --> 42:26.249
Is Port St. Lucie too far?

42:26.251 --> 42:28.651
[Man] Yeah, it just
depends on the case, though.

42:28.653 --> 42:30.189
What's goin' on?

42:37.896 --> 42:39.294
You Samantha?

42:39.296 --> 42:40.595
Jason?

42:40.597 --> 42:42.631
Well, duh, of course it's you.

42:42.633 --> 42:44.066
You ready?

42:44.068 --> 42:44.903
I am.

42:51.108 --> 42:52.341
Just want to thank
you again for coming

42:52.343 --> 42:53.642
on such short notice.

42:53.644 --> 42:55.510
I feel like that was a
really far drive for you.

42:55.512 --> 42:57.079
[Jason] No, it wasn't too bad.

42:57.081 --> 42:58.648
[Samantha] Now you don't
charge people to do this?

42:58.650 --> 43:00.216
[Jason] Nope.

43:00.218 --> 43:01.651
So how are you able
to do this type of work

43:01.653 --> 43:03.318
if you don't get paid?

43:03.320 --> 43:04.553
We all have regular jobs.

43:04.555 --> 43:06.187
We just do this
because we love it

43:06.189 --> 43:07.390
and we want to know the truth.

43:07.392 --> 43:10.126
And we love to help people.

43:10.128 --> 43:11.394
Huh.

43:11.396 --> 43:12.231
Interesting.

43:19.070 --> 43:20.702
Well, this is it.

43:20.704 --> 43:21.637
What do we do now?

43:21.639 --> 43:23.004
[Jason] I'm gonna pull
out one of my meters

43:23.006 --> 43:24.372
and see if there are any spikes,

43:24.374 --> 43:25.573
and I'll also run one
of the ghost boxes

43:25.575 --> 43:29.345
at the same time and see if
anyone can tell us anything.

43:29.347 --> 43:30.249
[Samantha] Okay.

43:31.648 --> 43:32.648
Now you said that you've
captured a little boy

43:32.650 --> 43:34.283
here on camera, right?

43:34.285 --> 43:35.517
Yes, twice.

43:35.519 --> 43:38.187
And also some sort of
black mist on the tree.

43:38.189 --> 43:40.455
Yeah, I'm gonna wanna
take a look at that footage,

43:40.457 --> 43:41.957
if that's possible.

43:41.959 --> 43:43.392
Yeah, sure.

43:43.394 --> 43:45.628
I mean, what do you
think is happening here

43:45.630 --> 43:48.396
based on what I've told you
we've been able to find?

43:48.398 --> 43:49.731
Honestly, I don't know.

43:49.733 --> 43:51.367
But based on what
you've told me,

43:51.369 --> 43:54.403
I'd say some very bad
stuff has happened here.

43:54.405 --> 43:56.037
Over the years with
each happening,

43:56.039 --> 43:59.075
the air's just accumulated
more and more bad energy.

43:59.077 --> 44:02.745
It's almost as if
something or someone

44:02.747 --> 44:05.284
is holding the spirits here
and it's very possible.

44:07.985 --> 44:08.619
Hello.

44:10.253 --> 44:11.086
My name is Jason.

44:11.088 --> 44:13.055
I come as a friend.

44:13.057 --> 44:15.992
Is there anyone who's here
that would like to speak to me?

44:15.994 --> 44:18.697
(static crackling)

44:20.664 --> 44:23.164
I come out of respect and love.

44:23.166 --> 44:24.001
Who's here?

44:25.102 --> 44:28.005
(static crackling)

44:33.543 --> 44:35.343
It may help if you say
something, Samantha.

44:35.345 --> 44:37.481
Sometimes they respond
to different people.

44:38.515 --> 44:39.715
What should I say?

44:39.717 --> 44:41.684
Just ask for someone
to come through.

44:41.686 --> 44:43.486
You said you know
this boy, right?

44:43.488 --> 44:44.323
Ask for him.

44:45.756 --> 44:49.660
Um, there's a boy here
named Benjamin, I believe?

44:50.595 --> 44:50.996
Can I speak to him?

44:53.764 --> 44:56.399
(child talking indiscernibly)

44:56.401 --> 44:58.233
Oh my God, that
sounded like a child.

44:58.235 --> 44:59.434
Yeah, yeah.

44:59.436 --> 45:00.236
And the closer I'm
getting to this tree,

45:00.238 --> 45:00.672
this meter is going up.

45:02.340 --> 45:04.039
That means there's a lot of
electromagnetic energy here.

45:04.041 --> 45:04.675
Look.

45:06.410 --> 45:07.475
Keep going, keep going.

45:07.477 --> 45:08.410
Keep talking.

45:08.412 --> 45:09.345
I think we can hear you.

45:09.347 --> 45:10.282
Can you say something else?

45:12.082 --> 45:13.749
[Benjamin] Samantha.

45:13.751 --> 45:15.684
Yes, I'm here.

45:15.686 --> 45:16.521
I can hear you.

45:19.057 --> 45:21.325
(growling)

45:22.727 --> 45:24.325
Sounds like the boy is here,

45:24.327 --> 45:27.495
but there's definitely something
very nasty here as well.

45:27.497 --> 45:29.330
Did you hear that?

45:29.332 --> 45:31.135
Yeah, let's head
back to the cars.

45:37.340 --> 45:39.575
So I'll head back and talk
to the rest of my team.

45:39.577 --> 45:40.675
I'll give you a call
later and let you know

45:40.677 --> 45:42.544
what night we can come back.

45:42.546 --> 45:44.648
Well, do you think
it's some kind of demon?

45:45.816 --> 45:47.816
I don't like to say
until I know more.

45:47.818 --> 45:49.718
When I come back I'll have
a very powerful medium

45:49.720 --> 45:51.320
and more of my gear.

45:51.322 --> 45:54.793
But yes, it very well
could be a demonic entity.

45:56.427 --> 45:58.794
Let me ask you, what else has
happened regarding this tree

45:58.796 --> 46:00.765
and why are you so
attached to this?

46:02.233 --> 46:03.068
I don't know.

46:03.867 --> 46:05.334
Huh, okay.

46:05.336 --> 46:06.171
Honest answer.

46:07.137 --> 46:09.204
All right, we'll talk soon.

46:09.206 --> 46:10.041
Okay.

46:12.209 --> 46:13.044
Hey, listen.

46:14.278 --> 46:15.678
Whatever it is, I'm
sure it's not something

46:15.680 --> 46:17.115
we haven't dealt with before.

46:18.249 --> 46:19.084
Okay.

46:25.490 --> 46:28.325
(engine starting)

46:32.463 --> 46:35.200
(dramatic music)

46:44.608 --> 46:47.078
(knocking)

46:52.249 --> 46:53.883
[Rob] What, Sam?

46:53.885 --> 46:55.818
You're not
answering your phone.

46:55.820 --> 46:56.854
Let me in.

47:10.867 --> 47:12.837
(sighing)

47:16.240 --> 47:17.876
Hey, man, talk to me.

47:20.244 --> 47:21.813
I really don't
know what to say.

47:23.680 --> 47:26.150
I'm questioning everything
in my life right now.

47:28.818 --> 47:30.721
This tree thing has
been really weird.

47:31.889 --> 47:34.222
I have no idea what
that dream was about.

47:34.224 --> 47:36.827
And why the hell do I
have this mark on my arm?

47:38.461 --> 47:39.827
Listen, I don't blame you.

47:39.829 --> 47:41.863
This whole thing is nuts.

47:41.865 --> 47:43.966
Not to mention the
story's pretty much fucked

47:43.968 --> 47:45.200
and all I want to
know is what the hell

47:45.202 --> 47:47.503
is happening at that damn tree.

47:47.505 --> 47:49.838
(sighing)

47:49.840 --> 47:52.774
I just feel terrible I got
you involved in all this.

47:52.776 --> 47:54.776
No, don't.

47:54.778 --> 47:55.780
It's just (sighing),

47:58.316 --> 48:00.216
last night was so real.

48:00.218 --> 48:01.620
It was like I was there.

48:02.852 --> 48:04.687
And honestly, do you think
that old man killing himself

48:04.689 --> 48:06.158
was just a coincidence?

48:07.691 --> 48:09.858
(sighing)

48:09.860 --> 48:12.363
Did you go see that survivor
of that satanic shit?

48:13.831 --> 48:15.231
Yeah.

48:15.233 --> 48:16.631
Her mom told me the
story of what happened.

48:16.633 --> 48:18.533
The girl really couldn't talk.

48:18.535 --> 48:20.369
It was horrifying.

48:20.371 --> 48:22.238
This just keeps gettin' worse.

48:22.240 --> 48:23.472
I mean, what?

48:23.474 --> 48:24.340
Did Satan plant
the tree himself?

48:24.342 --> 48:25.477
What the fuck?

48:26.577 --> 48:27.508
Hey, listen.

48:27.510 --> 48:28.676
Today after talking to you,

48:28.678 --> 48:30.745
I contacted this paranormal team

48:30.747 --> 48:33.552
and this guy drove up from
Miami and met me at the tree.

48:35.952 --> 48:36.919
Today?

48:36.921 --> 48:38.820
[Samantha] Yeah.

48:38.822 --> 48:40.856
Well, what happened?

48:40.858 --> 48:42.691
It was just me and him

48:42.693 --> 48:44.260
and he brought a few
pieces of equipment

48:44.262 --> 48:47.198
and we tried communicating
with whatever's there.

48:48.265 --> 48:49.367
I can't believe you.

48:50.434 --> 48:53.438
Did anything communicate
with you guys?

48:54.438 --> 48:55.840
We think we heard the boy.

48:58.342 --> 48:59.908
Anything else?

48:59.910 --> 49:00.908
Not really.

49:00.910 --> 49:02.044
What's not really?

49:02.046 --> 49:03.646
Either you did or you didn't.

49:03.648 --> 49:05.013
Well, I mean there was
a sound that came through,

49:05.015 --> 49:07.283
but we really couldn't
make out what it was.

49:07.285 --> 49:07.983
What kind of sound?

49:07.985 --> 49:09.517
A grumble.

49:09.519 --> 49:10.588
You mean a growl!

49:12.923 --> 49:15.760
Probably the same one I
heard in my dream last night.

49:17.294 --> 49:18.963
What did the paranormal guy say?

49:20.398 --> 49:22.930
He agreed to talk to his
team and come back and help.

49:22.932 --> 49:26.035
He said he'd probably be
up in the next day or so.

49:26.037 --> 49:28.070
Listen, you don't have
to do anything anymore.

49:28.072 --> 49:30.372
I'm sorry I got you
mixed up in all this.

49:30.374 --> 49:31.307
The town is right.

49:31.309 --> 49:33.541
They need to cut down that tree!

49:33.543 --> 49:34.545
Maybe they should.

49:35.746 --> 49:38.414
Just not before I
go back there again.

49:38.416 --> 49:39.851
I hope these guys can help.

49:42.653 --> 49:44.586
Anyways, I'm gonna go home.

49:44.588 --> 49:45.590
I, ah...

49:46.890 --> 49:49.091
I need to pack and stuff.

49:49.093 --> 49:50.262
Call me if you need me.

49:52.028 --> 49:53.829
Hey.

49:53.831 --> 49:54.733
[Samantha] Yeah?

49:57.068 --> 49:59.033
Just let me know when
those guys call you back.

49:59.035 --> 50:00.736
No, Rob, you don't have to.

50:00.738 --> 50:02.070
It's fine.

50:02.072 --> 50:02.906
No, I want to.

50:04.008 --> 50:06.044
Just let me know
when they're comin'.

50:07.610 --> 50:08.445
I will.

50:16.686 --> 50:18.489
How do you explain the
rise in the alternate press?

50:19.590 --> 50:20.858
Who are they speaking to?

50:21.925 --> 50:23.425
You?

50:23.427 --> 50:24.762
Someone in Oklahoma?

50:26.030 --> 50:26.997
Someone you trust?

50:28.698 --> 50:31.369
(phone ringing)

50:34.572 --> 50:35.407
Hey, Jason.

50:39.043 --> 50:40.008
Okay, yeah.

50:40.010 --> 50:41.046
Tomorrow, 6:00pm?

50:43.514 --> 50:44.879
Okay, thanks.

50:44.881 --> 50:45.717
Bye.

50:48.586 --> 50:51.055
(phone ringing)

50:54.624 --> 50:55.626
[Rob] Hey.

50:56.494 --> 50:57.725
[Samantha] He called.

50:57.727 --> 50:58.861
He and his team
will be at the park

50:58.863 --> 51:00.432
tomorrow at 6:00pm.

51:02.932 --> 51:04.635
Okay, I'll be there.

51:07.137 --> 51:10.074
(dramatic music)

51:36.133 --> 51:37.166
[Jason] All right, we're here.

51:37.168 --> 51:38.033
Ready to do this?

51:38.035 --> 51:38.901
I think so.

51:38.903 --> 51:40.436
We're all set, right?

51:40.438 --> 51:41.072
We are.

51:42.506 --> 51:43.738
Hey, I'm Jason.

51:43.740 --> 51:44.573
[Rob] Hey man, Rob.

51:44.575 --> 51:45.207
Good to meet you.

51:45.209 --> 51:46.175
[Rob] Yeah.

51:46.177 --> 51:47.209
Guys, this is Gloria.

51:47.211 --> 51:48.109
She's our medium.

51:48.111 --> 51:49.445
She'll be hopefully
communicating with

51:49.447 --> 51:50.077
whoever's at this location.

51:50.079 --> 51:51.446
And this is Kevin.

51:51.448 --> 51:52.213
He's our tech specialist.

51:52.215 --> 51:53.215
Pretty much our gear expert.

51:53.217 --> 51:54.682
Hi.

51:54.684 --> 51:56.751
Guys, this is
Samantha and Rob.

51:56.753 --> 51:58.187
All right, we ready go in?

51:58.189 --> 51:59.220
[Samantha] Let's do it.

51:59.222 --> 52:00.057
Shall we?

52:08.231 --> 52:09.198
All right, Kevin, when
we get to the tree,

52:09.200 --> 52:11.066
let's set up the full
spectrum along with

52:11.068 --> 52:12.600
the SLSX cam, okay?

52:12.602 --> 52:14.102
And let's see if we can
capture anything visually.

52:14.104 --> 52:16.472
Was getting full EMS
spikes off the tree.

52:16.474 --> 52:17.638
You got it.

52:17.640 --> 52:18.606
Should I set up a thermal?

52:18.608 --> 52:20.075
Yeah, I think you should.

52:20.077 --> 52:22.044
And Gloria, see what
you feel at first,

52:22.046 --> 52:23.178
but keep it to yourself, okay?

52:23.180 --> 52:25.613
I want to try to use some
of the equipment to start.

52:25.615 --> 52:27.048
No problem.

52:27.050 --> 52:29.218
I can tell you right now
there are a lot of eyes on us.

52:29.220 --> 52:31.053
What, right now?

52:31.055 --> 52:33.555
Yeah, I can't tell
who they are yet,

52:33.557 --> 52:35.160
but they're watching us.

52:36.793 --> 52:39.227
I think it's just up
this way a little bit.

52:39.229 --> 52:40.195
Right, Samantha?

52:40.197 --> 52:42.199
Yeah, up the path
just a little further.

52:43.601 --> 52:45.503
Where did you find
these guys again?

52:48.137 --> 52:51.508
(soft dramatic music)

52:57.847 --> 52:58.682
Sam.

53:01.519 --> 53:03.218
Remember what we heard
through the box the other day?

53:03.220 --> 53:04.253
The growl?

53:04.255 --> 53:05.086
[Samantha] Yeah.

53:05.088 --> 53:06.921
I know that was
alarming to you,

53:06.923 --> 53:09.557
but try and check your
fear when we're doing this.

53:09.559 --> 53:11.929
So if you are scared,
which is normal,

53:13.097 --> 53:14.662
negative entities
feed off of it.

53:14.664 --> 53:15.566
Gives them power.

53:16.834 --> 53:18.566
[Samantha] Makes sense.

53:18.568 --> 53:20.635
I think that's a little
easier said than done, though.

53:20.637 --> 53:22.539
I, I know it is,
but it's important.

53:23.840 --> 53:25.039
All right, I got my handheld

53:25.041 --> 53:26.510
and sticks over there
in case I need it.

53:27.811 --> 53:28.644
Oh, that's pretty cool.

53:28.646 --> 53:29.878
Let me see.

53:29.880 --> 53:32.180
Wonder if I can get
that in night vision.

53:32.182 --> 53:33.615
Nice.

53:33.617 --> 53:35.249
All right, we're
all set here, Jason.

53:35.251 --> 53:36.952
Just need to format
one of the SD cards,

53:36.954 --> 53:39.187
but that should only
take a few minutes.

53:39.189 --> 53:41.122
Okay, well let's all have
a seat around the lantern

53:41.124 --> 53:42.927
and we'll get ready to begin.

53:45.296 --> 53:47.963
It's scary as fuck
out here at night.

53:47.965 --> 53:50.200
I know, but try
and not be scared.

53:52.202 --> 53:53.872
Can't believe I'm out here.

53:55.805 --> 53:56.807
I'm glad you came.

53:57.974 --> 53:59.743
Okay, so let's just
do a quick prayer.

54:01.644 --> 54:03.678
Great spirit in the sky,

54:03.680 --> 54:06.347
we ask for your
care and protection,

54:06.349 --> 54:08.950
and for you to allow us
to be effective tonight

54:08.952 --> 54:11.653
in finding out whatever
it is we need to.

54:11.655 --> 54:12.687
Amen.

54:12.689 --> 54:13.821
[All] Amen.

54:13.823 --> 54:14.756
Jason, I'm just curious.

54:14.758 --> 54:16.124
I never asked you.

54:16.126 --> 54:18.894
What's the craziest
case you've ever had?

54:18.896 --> 54:21.064
There's always one
that sticks out to me.

54:21.898 --> 54:22.965
The Marine.

54:22.967 --> 54:24.265
Absolutely.

54:24.267 --> 54:25.802
What happened with the Marine?

54:27.236 --> 54:29.541
Ah, we still have a few
minutes on that SD card?

54:31.307 --> 54:34.276
We were called to the
home of a US Marine sniper

54:34.278 --> 54:36.278
who had just gotten
back from Afghanistan,

54:36.280 --> 54:39.180
something like his
third tour or something.

54:39.182 --> 54:41.883
And he couldn't have
been a nicer guy,

54:41.885 --> 54:44.753
but when we got
there he told us why

54:44.755 --> 54:45.923
he was so freaked out.

54:47.057 --> 54:48.624
The night before he woke up,

54:48.626 --> 54:50.191
went to his kitchen
to get a drink,

54:50.193 --> 54:51.693
he noticed all of his
dining room chairs

54:51.695 --> 54:54.566
just stacked up one by
one by the front door.

54:55.798 --> 54:59.033
So I asked him if he
suffered from PTSD

54:59.035 --> 55:01.336
or was taking any medications.

55:01.338 --> 55:03.104
I mean, I wasn't trying
to be disrespectful,

55:03.106 --> 55:06.274
but these kinds of
things we need to know.

55:06.644 --> 55:09.647
So he said he wasn't, so
we decided to proceed.

55:10.814 --> 55:12.747
We conducted a walkthrough

55:12.749 --> 55:15.652
and had Gloria tap in to
see what she could pick up.

55:17.287 --> 55:19.854
A foreign man came through.

55:19.856 --> 55:20.858
His name was Abdul.

55:22.358 --> 55:23.758
He proceeded to tell
us that there were

55:23.760 --> 55:26.128
six other spirits there,

55:26.130 --> 55:29.300
all Afghan soldiers that
were killed by our Marine.

55:30.800 --> 55:32.903
I asked them what their
purpose there was.

55:34.037 --> 55:36.671
They said they intended
on exacting revenge

55:36.673 --> 55:38.675
from the soldier for
taking their lives.

55:40.077 --> 55:42.013
I asked them how they
planned to do it.

55:43.180 --> 55:44.412
And they said that
they're gonna drive

55:44.414 --> 55:46.080
the soldier insane
to the point that he

55:46.082 --> 55:47.285
would commit suicide.

55:49.852 --> 55:53.387
It was at that point a loud
voice came over the box

55:53.389 --> 55:56.793
and screamed,
"Death to you all."

55:59.063 --> 56:00.829
From there we decided
to do a full cleanse,

56:00.831 --> 56:03.698
but ah, it wasn't easy.

56:03.700 --> 56:05.399
And we were there all night.

56:05.401 --> 56:07.202
We had our bodies scratched.

56:07.204 --> 56:09.336
Gloria got unbelievably sick.

56:09.338 --> 56:10.872
And all of our equipment
was malfunctioning,

56:10.874 --> 56:13.774
but somehow we pulled through

56:13.776 --> 56:17.948
and hours later we were
able to cleanse the home.

56:18.481 --> 56:20.184
Wow, that is insane.

56:21.485 --> 56:23.151
Was the Marine okay?

56:23.153 --> 56:25.053
Okay? (chuckles)

56:25.055 --> 56:26.658
He slept like a baby that night.

56:28.291 --> 56:29.725
I mean, don't get me wrong.

56:29.727 --> 56:30.626
We've dealt with
pure evil before,

56:30.628 --> 56:32.928
and some people
change from one minute

56:32.930 --> 56:34.729
to the next, almost possessed,

56:34.731 --> 56:37.399
but the spirits of these six men

56:37.401 --> 56:40.371
were so determined
to kill this man that

56:41.305 --> 56:42.707
they might've succeeded.

56:43.807 --> 56:44.909
Okay, we're all set.

56:46.910 --> 56:48.477
Looks like we already
got something.

56:48.479 --> 56:50.979
[Jason] What's showin' up?

56:50.981 --> 56:54.416
It's gone already,
but looked almost like

56:54.418 --> 56:57.084
a small figure behind the tree.

56:57.086 --> 56:59.387
What, like hiding behind it?

56:59.389 --> 57:01.059
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

57:03.760 --> 57:04.695
And according to this,

57:06.063 --> 57:08.396
we seem to be surrounded
by multiple entities.

57:08.398 --> 57:09.901
Turn on the geobox, Kev.

57:11.535 --> 57:13.468
Gloria, are you
feelin' anything?

57:13.470 --> 57:14.468
I feel something.

57:14.470 --> 57:16.239
I'm just not sure what.

57:17.407 --> 57:20.144
It's almost as if it
doesn't want me to see it.

57:22.979 --> 57:24.247
Who's out here with us?

57:25.548 --> 57:27.784
We see you coming
through the camera.

57:29.119 --> 57:30.184
You say anything
through the box,

57:30.186 --> 57:31.955
just to identify yourself.

57:34.457 --> 57:36.860
(whispering)

57:37.827 --> 57:39.861
I'm hearing noises out there.

57:39.863 --> 57:40.498
Me, too.

57:41.430 --> 57:42.967
Talk to me, it's okay.

57:44.101 --> 57:45.470
We're here to find
out the truth.

57:46.936 --> 57:47.771
Who are you?

57:49.139 --> 57:53.311
(people talking)
(static crackling)

58:00.316 --> 58:01.416
[Boy] Benjamin.

58:01.418 --> 58:02.483
Did you hear that?

58:02.485 --> 58:03.584
He said Benjamin.

58:03.586 --> 58:04.419
That's the boy.

58:04.421 --> 58:05.256
Right, Sam?

58:06.222 --> 58:08.825
There's still multiple
entities on that radar?

58:10.093 --> 58:11.796
They're disappearing
one by one.

58:12.896 --> 58:15.497
And their apparently
is a red dot.

58:15.499 --> 58:16.932
What's a red dot.

58:16.934 --> 58:19.102
A lower vibrational entity.

58:20.503 --> 58:23.440
Something more
powerful and sinister,

58:24.441 --> 58:25.276
like a demon.

58:26.610 --> 58:28.542
Gloria, can you try to
connect with the boy?

58:28.544 --> 58:29.780
Absolutely.

58:33.015 --> 58:34.615
What was his name again?

58:34.617 --> 58:35.852
Benjamin.

58:39.122 --> 58:41.325
We'd like to talk
to Benjamin if we can.

58:48.432 --> 58:49.267
He's here.

58:51.101 --> 58:51.968
He's adorable.

58:53.604 --> 58:56.271
He's seven or eight.

58:56.273 --> 58:57.275
He was eight, yes.

58:59.876 --> 59:01.642
Well, Sam, would you
like to talk to him?

59:01.644 --> 59:02.947
I'm sure he'll answer you.

59:03.981 --> 59:04.816
Yes, I can.

59:08.584 --> 59:10.454
Benjamin, can you hear me?

59:12.622 --> 59:14.992
So I'm just, I'm
just gonna go deeper.

59:15.959 --> 59:17.428
Just let him talk through me.

59:20.631 --> 59:22.300
Yes, I'm here.

59:23.666 --> 59:24.901
I can hear you.

59:26.336 --> 59:27.371
Hello, Samantha.

59:29.305 --> 59:31.071
Hello, Benjamin.

59:31.073 --> 59:33.441
Can I ask you a
question, Benjamin?

59:33.443 --> 59:34.946
Who else is out here with you?

59:37.014 --> 59:40.282
I'd like to talk to
Samantha, if you don't mind.

59:40.284 --> 59:41.349
(chuckles)

59:41.351 --> 59:42.517
No problem.

59:42.519 --> 59:43.421
I don't blame you.

59:47.657 --> 59:50.093
Benjamin, are you out
here all by yourself?

59:51.595 --> 59:53.397
No, there are others.

59:54.697 --> 59:57.000
Is there anything
we can do to help you?

59:58.035 --> 01:00:00.872
No, no one can help me now.

01:00:03.506 --> 01:00:06.608
I'm, I'm losing the connection.

01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:08.242
Keep talking to him.

01:00:08.244 --> 01:00:09.646
Benjamin, can you hear me?

01:00:11.081 --> 01:00:12.249
Yes, I'm here.

01:00:15.285 --> 01:00:16.184
It's happening again.

01:00:16.186 --> 01:00:18.218
I, I feel a disconnect.

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.954
It can happen if there's
something else here

01:00:19.956 --> 01:00:21.958
restricting the energy.

01:00:23.593 --> 01:00:25.260
Benjamin, I don't
know if you heard me,

01:00:25.262 --> 01:00:27.227
but I was wondering
if you could share

01:00:27.229 --> 01:00:28.298
what happened to you.

01:00:29.666 --> 01:00:32.102
Yes, Samantha,
I will tell you.

01:00:34.236 --> 01:00:35.939
I was the first one here.

01:00:37.673 --> 01:00:39.110
I was a child.

01:00:41.177 --> 01:00:43.179
I was the first
victim at this tree.

01:00:46.182 --> 01:00:48.385
I was not brought
here by choice.

01:00:49.519 --> 01:00:51.289
A man took me from my school.

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:53.624
I was tricked.

01:00:56.226 --> 01:00:58.061
He pulled me into the woods.

01:01:01.631 --> 01:01:04.001
He told me to act like a dog.

01:01:06.602 --> 01:01:08.102
I couldn't defend myself

01:01:08.104 --> 01:01:10.373
and no one was here to help me.

01:01:15.611 --> 01:01:17.615
I died of a heart
attack eventually.

01:01:19.782 --> 01:01:21.551
I could not bear anymore pain.

01:01:27.624 --> 01:01:29.193
Did they ever find your body?

01:01:30.494 --> 01:01:34.030
My body was destroyed
and thrown elsewhere.

01:01:35.798 --> 01:01:39.570
I came back here because
this is where I died.

01:01:41.604 --> 01:01:43.240
Now I am here with many.

01:01:45.776 --> 01:01:48.746
I am not the oldest by far.

01:01:51.113 --> 01:01:52.749
But I am the most powerful.

01:01:53.682 --> 01:01:56.417
(whispering)

01:01:56.419 --> 01:01:57.220
That's why

01:01:59.189 --> 01:02:00.157
I'm the leader.

01:02:02.559 --> 01:02:03.995
You see, Samantha.

01:02:06.063 --> 01:02:07.030
It isn't the tree.

01:02:09.231 --> 01:02:10.066
It's me.

01:02:11.133 --> 01:02:12.100
What are we doing, Sam?

01:02:12.102 --> 01:02:12.834
I don't know.

01:02:12.836 --> 01:02:14.068
What the hell is happening?

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:15.070
Look, man.

01:02:15.072 --> 01:02:16.273
What is that all around her?

01:02:20.709 --> 01:02:22.679
[Samantha] Why
would you do this?

01:02:24.481 --> 01:02:25.683
I was wronged.

01:02:26.582 --> 01:02:28.251
And I will get God back.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.055
He is a heartless God.

01:02:32.822 --> 01:02:35.823
And I will bring
pain and suffering

01:02:35.825 --> 01:02:38.061
to as many people as I can.

01:02:41.697 --> 01:02:43.497
And I'm good at it.

01:02:43.499 --> 01:02:44.698
(dramatic music)

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.334
(gasping)

01:02:47.336 --> 01:02:48.338
Oh my God.

01:02:51.173 --> 01:02:52.140
Pack up the stuff quick.

01:02:52.142 --> 01:02:53.108
We're gettin' out of here.

01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:54.512
We gotta get her to a hospital.

01:02:56.113 --> 01:02:59.082
(soft dramatic music)

01:03:02.352 --> 01:03:03.184
Guys, let's go.

01:03:03.186 --> 01:03:04.151
We can't wait for you.

01:03:04.153 --> 01:03:05.622
Be right there, believe me!

01:03:06.856 --> 01:03:07.823
All right, Sam.

01:03:07.825 --> 01:03:09.727
They're halfway to the
parking lot by now.

01:03:13.697 --> 01:03:15.762
[Samantha] This
wasn't your fault.

01:03:15.764 --> 01:03:17.267
Sam, what are you doing?

01:03:19.769 --> 01:03:20.869
I know you were a good kid.

01:03:20.871 --> 01:03:23.303
You have to let this go.

01:03:23.305 --> 01:03:24.905
What the hell are you doing?

01:03:24.907 --> 01:03:25.606
It's demonic!

01:03:25.608 --> 01:03:27.577
You're trying to reason with it?

01:03:28.744 --> 01:03:30.711
I can feel his pain.

01:03:30.713 --> 01:03:31.815
I want to help him.

01:03:32.916 --> 01:03:33.914
I know I can help him.

01:03:33.916 --> 01:03:34.883
This is nuts!

01:03:34.885 --> 01:03:35.718
Benjamin.

01:03:36.887 --> 01:03:38.686
Listen to me.

01:03:38.688 --> 01:03:39.756
I know you can hear me.

01:03:41.925 --> 01:03:45.229
You're hurting innocent
people like you and I were.

01:03:49.698 --> 01:03:51.399
My father used to
come into my room

01:03:51.401 --> 01:03:52.770
when my mother worked late.

01:04:01.443 --> 01:04:03.880
I would run and hide and
he would make it a game.

01:04:04.881 --> 01:04:06.117
Hide and seek.

01:04:11.887 --> 01:04:13.854
I would hide in the closet,

01:04:13.856 --> 01:04:15.458
but I knew he would find me.

01:04:17.394 --> 01:04:18.760
But I was young
and I didn't know

01:04:18.762 --> 01:04:22.166
where I could go,
what I could do.

01:04:24.901 --> 01:04:26.867
And when he'd find me,
he would toy with me

01:04:26.869 --> 01:04:28.572
and not open the
door right away.

01:04:30.539 --> 01:04:32.909
And I would just try
to escape that place.

01:04:34.276 --> 01:04:37.845
Try to escape into
another moment.

01:04:37.847 --> 01:04:39.847
Samantha, I can't
say this again.

01:04:39.849 --> 01:04:42.283
We have to go now.

01:04:42.285 --> 01:04:45.890
Benjamin, you don't
have to do this anymore.

01:04:46.889 --> 01:04:49.289
You can let this go
and forgive the man

01:04:49.291 --> 01:04:50.527
that did this to you.

01:04:51.727 --> 01:04:53.327
I know that God has
already forgiven you

01:04:53.329 --> 01:04:54.564
for what you've done.

01:04:55.465 --> 01:04:56.930
(dramatic music)

01:04:56.932 --> 01:04:59.700
[Benjamin] I don't
need God's forgiveness.

01:04:59.702 --> 01:05:00.637
He needs mine.

01:05:04.907 --> 01:05:05.942
Benjamin.

01:05:08.345 --> 01:05:09.547
I just want to help you.

01:05:10.713 --> 01:05:12.715
I told you no one
can help you now.

01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:15.783
Rob, what are you doing?

01:05:15.785 --> 01:05:16.950
Rob's no longer
here, Samantha.

01:05:16.952 --> 01:05:20.021
(slap smacking)

01:05:20.023 --> 01:05:21.555
I bring bad things here.

01:05:21.557 --> 01:05:23.258
This is my intention.

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.925
I was not powerful
when I was alive,

01:05:24.927 --> 01:05:26.727
but here, I am powerful.

01:05:26.729 --> 01:05:28.629
Not over me you don't!

01:05:28.631 --> 01:05:31.265
(grunting)

01:05:31.267 --> 01:05:32.800
Let's change that.

01:05:32.802 --> 01:05:34.001
No! Stop!

01:05:34.003 --> 01:05:35.403
[Rob/Benjamin] Let's
expose you for who

01:05:35.405 --> 01:05:36.870
you really are, Samantha.

01:05:36.872 --> 01:05:37.939
You liked it when
your father did

01:05:37.941 --> 01:05:39.006
those things to you, didn't you?

01:05:39.008 --> 01:05:40.041
Rob!

01:05:40.043 --> 01:05:40.975
Can you hear me?

01:05:40.977 --> 01:05:41.943
You are stronger than this!

01:05:41.945 --> 01:05:42.811
Rob!

01:05:42.813 --> 01:05:44.912
That's the word
of a little girl.

01:05:44.914 --> 01:05:47.481
I told you Rob is gone.

01:05:47.483 --> 01:05:50.917
I think it's time for you
to join me here at the tree.

01:05:50.919 --> 01:05:52.754
I liked you.

01:05:52.756 --> 01:05:56.927
(grunting)
(gasping)

01:05:57.526 --> 01:05:59.662
(screaming)

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:05.869
(dramatic music)

01:06:08.537 --> 01:06:11.307
(blood spurting)

01:06:15.945 --> 01:06:18.015
(crying)

01:06:19.715 --> 01:06:22.252
(screaming)

01:06:25.689 --> 01:06:27.387
Oh my God!

01:06:27.389 --> 01:06:28.990
Oh my God, Rob!

01:06:28.992 --> 01:06:30.260
I'm so sorry!

01:06:31.061 --> 01:06:33.430
(sobbing)

01:06:35.064 --> 01:06:38.302
(blood trickling)

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:45.675
I'm sorry.

01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:49.280
(sobbing)

01:06:59.356 --> 01:07:02.090
You have the power to
do all these bad things?

01:07:02.092 --> 01:07:03.894
Do them to me yourself!

01:07:06.863 --> 01:07:09.633
(dramatic music)

01:07:13.369 --> 01:07:14.371
Oh my God.

01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:17.807
(dramatic music)

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:25.146
Boy, I order you
right now to release her

01:07:25.148 --> 01:07:26.749
in the name of Jesus Christ.

01:07:28.017 --> 01:07:29.419
You know you can't touch me!

01:07:30.653 --> 01:07:32.956
Release her now!

01:07:40.729 --> 01:07:43.900
(soft dramatic music)

01:08:41.624 --> 01:08:43.024
Here you go, sweetie.

01:08:43.026 --> 01:08:43.861
Thank you.

01:08:48.697 --> 01:08:50.465
Can't believe how
big she's gotten.

01:08:50.466 --> 01:08:51.966
I know!

01:08:51.968 --> 01:08:53.700
I don't know where
the time goes.

01:08:53.702 --> 01:08:55.136
It seems like it
was just last year

01:08:55.138 --> 01:08:56.169
we were living in Florida,

01:08:56.171 --> 01:08:58.872
Steven was looking for a job.

01:08:58.875 --> 01:09:00.844
I blink my eyes and here we are.

01:09:02.478 --> 01:09:04.814
You just never know where
life is gonna take you.

01:09:06.883 --> 01:09:07.917
You're not kidding.

01:09:12.254 --> 01:09:14.490
How are you doing
with everything, Sam?

01:09:21.598 --> 01:09:24.435
I just can't believe
that I'm alive.

01:09:26.169 --> 01:09:29.606
And I think that it should've
been me instead of him.

01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:35.140
I'm learning to
live with the guilt.

01:09:35.143 --> 01:09:36.209
I know there was
nothing I could do.

01:09:36.211 --> 01:09:38.514
I just don't understand it.

01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:41.952
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

01:09:43.519 --> 01:09:47.457
But I do know that you
are one strong woman.

01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:49.992
Don't you forget that.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:51.995
Thank you.

01:09:53.196 --> 01:09:55.762
I just don't feel
that strong sometimes.

01:09:55.764 --> 01:09:58.164
Well, you are.

01:09:58.166 --> 01:10:00.036
I've always known
that about you.

01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:03.169
So?

01:10:03.171 --> 01:10:04.140
How's the job?

01:10:06.009 --> 01:10:09.543
It just started and it's hard.

01:10:09.545 --> 01:10:10.877
(laughing)

01:10:10.879 --> 01:10:12.181
But it's amazing.

01:10:13.081 --> 01:10:14.882
That is so great.

01:10:14.884 --> 01:10:16.784
I'm so happy you're here.

01:10:16.786 --> 01:10:19.523
And now you're closer so
we'll get to see you more.

01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:23.724
How are you doin'
over there, sweetie?

01:10:23.726 --> 01:10:24.728
[Ava] Good, Mommy.

01:10:25.762 --> 01:10:27.627
Are you thirsty?

01:10:27.629 --> 01:10:28.430
[Ava] No, Mommy.

01:10:29.999 --> 01:10:31.802
Let me go play
with her for a bit.

01:10:36.171 --> 01:10:39.543
(soft dramatic music)

01:10:42.111 --> 01:10:44.177
Gotcha! (laughing)

01:10:44.179 --> 01:10:46.580
Watcha doin'?

01:10:46.582 --> 01:10:47.213
Playing.

01:10:47.215 --> 01:10:48.248
Oh yeah?

01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:49.085
Can I play too?

01:10:49.952 --> 01:10:51.522
Sure, sit down.

01:10:53.656 --> 01:10:56.593
(dramatic music)

01:10:59.762 --> 01:11:01.697
Why did you draw
that design, sweetie?

01:11:02.365 --> 01:11:04.230
I didn't draw that, silly.

01:11:04.232 --> 01:11:05.601
My friend did.

01:11:07.269 --> 01:11:08.871
What's your friend's name?

01:11:10.272 --> 01:11:11.707
[Ava] Benjamin.

01:11:12.741 --> 01:11:15.745
(crickets chirping)

01:11:37.834 --> 01:11:40.304
(ominous music)

01:12:05.228 --> 01:12:08.599
(soft dramatic music)

01:12:16.839 --> 01:12:17.908
I am

01:12:19.207 --> 01:12:20.975
the first one here

01:12:20.977 --> 01:12:23.280
that got

01:12:26.148 --> 01:12:28.017
abused here.

01:12:29.184 --> 01:12:31.918
And I was here

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.320
not by choice.

01:12:34.322 --> 01:12:35.455
[Woman] Right.

01:12:35.457 --> 01:12:36.356
Someone brought you here.

01:12:36.358 --> 01:12:37.391
Yes.

01:12:37.393 --> 01:12:39.392
I was tricked

01:12:39.394 --> 01:12:40.731
and he

01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:43.066
was

01:12:45.034 --> 01:12:47.034
extremely sick.

01:12:47.036 --> 01:12:50.404
We are able to influence
people that come here

01:12:50.406 --> 01:12:53.774
to do bad things

01:12:53.776 --> 01:12:56.810
and this is what we want.

01:12:56.812 --> 01:13:00.916
A lot of us are coming
after you right now.

01:13:02.818 --> 01:13:05.688
We are fierce.
