00:20.841 --> 00:25.510
Good Hulk.
Next we'll try fetch and play smash.

00:25.512 --> 00:26.778
Stay with me, Stark!

00:26.780 --> 00:31.183
How's a guy supposed to pass out
in peace with you yelling like that?

00:33.619 --> 00:35.087
How's he holding up, Falcon?

00:35.089 --> 00:36.254
[beeps]

00:37.490 --> 00:40.792
- Falcon: If he was a car, he'd be...
- A really cool sports car.

00:41.794 --> 00:43.495
...running on fumes.

00:43.497 --> 00:46.332
He needs medical and tech, now.
Where's the Quinjet?

00:46.532 --> 00:50.669
There, there,
and, yeah, there.

00:50.671 --> 00:55.340
M.O.D.O.K. and the Red Skull
met our arrival enthusiastically.

00:55.342 --> 00:57.876
<i>Widow: [on speakers]
I brought my own ride.</i>

00:57.878 --> 01:00.412
<i>Just promise not to rip the leather.</i>

01:04.250 --> 01:06.518
<i>Hawkeye: [grunts]
Crowded in here.</i>

01:06.520 --> 01:10.722
Shouldn't those who can jump
be outside? Jumping? Hulk?

01:10.724 --> 01:13.725
Deal with it. There's a
NATO hospital in Reykjavik.

01:13.727 --> 01:15.520
<i>Twenty minutes if there's no traffic.</i>

01:15.555 --> 01:17.329
A hospital won't cut it.

01:17.331 --> 01:19.264
Tony's armor was the only
thing keeping him alive,

01:19.266 --> 01:20.899
<i>specifically the ARC reactor.</i>

01:20.901 --> 01:23.902
- Without it...
- Get me to the mansion.

01:23.904 --> 01:26.538
You sure?
I don't know if that'll be possible...

01:26.540 --> 01:31.143
Welcome to the big leagues, Falcon.
Impossible is what we do.

01:31.145 --> 01:32.310
<i>Thor: A wind tunnel?</i>

01:33.913 --> 01:35.647
<i>Aye, follow me!</i>

[whimpering]

01:41.688 --> 01:45.824
Hey, do I know
how to pick a team or what?

01:46.292 --> 01:48.226
[groans]

01:48.228 --> 01:51.930
Tony. Tony!
Iron Man!

[grunts]

02:19.860 --> 02:21.493
The lab! Go!

02:25.548 --> 02:29.467
Twice in one day?
Thought I was done with this dump.

02:29.469 --> 02:31.099
Dump? Like you've seen nicer.

02:31.134 --> 02:32.704
[grunts]

02:33.839 --> 02:37.042
Try not to die on my first
day as an Avenger, Tony.

02:40.314 --> 02:42.781
<i>Come on, Tony.</i>

02:43.849 --> 02:47.018
<i>Come on!
[Tony groaning]</i>

02:50.089 --> 02:53.525
That was something I would
never want to do again.

02:54.327 --> 02:57.996
Thanks for not electrocuting me
on your first day as an Avenger, Sam!

02:57.998 --> 03:01.833
He's not good with "thank yous."
Great work, Falcon.

03:01.835 --> 03:06.738
Could you say that again into my phone?
I... I want to make it my ring tone.

03:06.740 --> 03:09.507
[chuckles]
Rookies.

03:09.509 --> 03:12.377
Jarvis?
The Mark 50, if you please.

03:12.379 --> 03:13.978
<i>Jarvis:  Sir, the Mark 50 is not ready.</i>

03:13.980 --> 03:16.614
Jarvis, the Mark 50!

03:16.616 --> 03:18.683
[mechanical whirring]

03:24.557 --> 03:26.858
And Sam?
Thank you.

03:28.327 --> 03:31.863
See? I can be nice.
When I almost die.

03:31.865 --> 03:35.734
Does that mean I get an
Avengers membership card?

03:35.736 --> 03:37.569
Just what we needed.

03:37.571 --> 03:40.505
A Stark fan boy with
delusions of grandeur.

03:44.143 --> 03:49.547
<i>Iron Skull: Stark's armor is an even
greater prize than the Captain's body.</i>

03:49.549 --> 03:51.649
<i>Wearing it not only keeps me alive,</i>

03:51.651 --> 03:54.768
<i>it has made me beyond flesh and bone!</i>

03:54.803 --> 03:57.722
Indeed. Iron Man is gone.

03:57.990 --> 04:01.726
<i>Iron Man?
Have you learned nothing, M.O.D.O.K.?</i>

04:01.728 --> 04:04.429
It isn't enough to beat one Avenger.

04:04.431 --> 04:08.833
To fully triumph, we must
destroy all they represent.

04:08.835 --> 04:14.072
While they lick their wounds, we shall
strike the Avengers where they live.

04:14.074 --> 04:19.444
It would be unfortunate if they
made it home with time to plan, yes.

04:19.446 --> 04:23.548
<i>Then it's good that I sent them
off with companions, isn't it?</i>

04:25.785 --> 04:27.852
<i>Cap: Any idea what Stark's up to?</i>

04:27.854 --> 04:30.889
Falcon: Nothing I ever worked on.
Which makes me totally jealous.

04:30.891 --> 04:34.492
Iron Man: The Mark 50.
Prototype modular system.

04:34.494 --> 04:36.494
New armor smell and everything.

04:36.496 --> 04:39.931
In theory, more efficient, more powerful

04:39.933 --> 04:42.133
than any of my ARC reactor models.

04:42.735 --> 04:44.669
[grunts]

04:44.671 --> 04:48.740
- Oops.
- "In theory" equals "untested." Classic.

04:48.742 --> 04:50.975
Details. I'll work it out.

04:50.977 --> 04:53.978
Soon as I do, I'll be smacking
the red off of the Red Skull.

04:53.980 --> 04:56.848
- You mean "we."
- I didn't say "we."

04:56.850 --> 05:00.652
I know that look. It comes right
before "it's not you, it's me."

05:00.654 --> 05:05.156
Look, I activated the Avengers protocol
because I thought you were gone, Cap.

05:05.158 --> 05:09.694
You're back. I didn't croak.  {*corr}
Wins all around, so back to the grind, right?

05:09.696 --> 05:13.498
Seriously? You rebooted
the Avengers just to break us up again?

05:13.500 --> 05:18.603
- Unbelievable.
- And people wonder why I hate people.

05:18.605 --> 05:22.974
<i>Mortals... fun but too complicated.</i>

05:22.976 --> 05:27.111
You're serious?
After what we just survived?

05:28.147 --> 05:28.847
Looks that way.

05:32.785 --> 05:34.085
You missed this team, didn't you?

05:34.087 --> 05:38.022
Me? No.
I like doing my own thing.

05:38.024 --> 05:40.792
<i>Yo soy solo. You?</i>

05:40.794 --> 05:43.027
S.H.I.E.L.D. sent me to
keep an eye on you maniacs

05:43.029 --> 05:45.263
- and make sure you don't blow up Manhattan.
- Fair enough.

05:45.265 --> 05:48.633
Did you really believe that
Tony Stark could play quarterback

05:48.635 --> 05:53.738
- on a team of more than one?
- For a minute, kind of did.

05:56.675 --> 05:59.978
<i>Thor: We had some grand battles
in this training room, you and I...</i>

05:59.980 --> 06:04.649
You kept thinking you
could knock me down.

06:04.651 --> 06:06.885
Did more than think, I think.

06:06.887 --> 06:09.575
What do you say?
For old times?

06:12.825 --> 06:15.760
<i>Hulk: Wouldn't wanna mess

That's not like you!

Hmm?

06:57.069 --> 06:58.036
[growls]

07:00.039 --> 07:02.874
Explain. And if you give
me any of that Stark talk,

07:02.876 --> 07:05.043
I'll knock you out of that armor myself.

07:05.045 --> 07:09.180
I led the Avengers for a day,
and I almost lost everyone.

07:09.182 --> 07:12.617
So you're scared. We all get
scared, and we push through.

07:12.619 --> 07:15.053
Cap, I'm not afraid of
what could happen to me.

07:15.055 --> 07:18.590
The Skull and M.O.D.O.K.
almost got all of you.

07:18.592 --> 07:22.860
What if I lead you somewhere,
and I can't bring you back?

07:22.862 --> 07:24.829
That's our choice, isn't it?

07:24.831 --> 07:26.831
[rumbling]
Hmm?

07:28.934 --> 07:30.368

Guys, enough! He's strongest,
you're prettiest, whatever!

07:38.479 --> 07:40.760
No, something's wrong.

07:41.113 --> 07:45.614
You dare touch the Son of Odin?
I'll tear you apart, monster!

You are not better than me!

08:20.387 --> 08:23.087
When did they invent
Hulk-buster arrows?

08:23.089 --> 08:24.555
<i>They didn't.</i>

- Oh, please.
- You make me sick.

08:35.443 --> 08:40.484

- Better than being Fury's watchdog.

- You lead. I'll follow.

13:36.852 --> 13:38.886
Hawkeye. Short out his armor.

13:41.623 --> 13:44.992
Nice, Cap.
Widow, your turn!

13:44.994 --> 13:48.128
For someone who sent us packing,
you're awfully liberal with the orders.

13:49.864 --> 13:51.965
[Iron Skull groans]

13:51.967 --> 13:53.600
Else was gonna save you from yourselves?

13:53.802 --> 13:57.104
Thor, he's wide open!
Hammer time.

13:57.106 --> 13:57.704
[grunts]

13:59.841 --> 14:02.909
Falcon, these are Skull's armor specs.

14:02.911 --> 14:05.249
<i>Show him what a rookie can do.</i>

14:12.654 --> 14:16.857
Careful. Keep leading like that and
we might actually stick together.

14:16.859 --> 14:22.195
Iron Skull: Yes, let Stark lead you
through your final glorious moment.

14:22.197 --> 14:23.964
[grunts]

14:23.966 --> 14:27.801
This game is over
before it has even begun.

14:27.803 --> 14:32.906
<i>I took your armor.
I will take your lives.</i>

14:32.908 --> 14:37.344
<i>And take your honor
by leaving a scar on this nation</i>

14:37.346 --> 14:40.981
that will forever be
blamed on the Avengers!

14:46.120 --> 14:49.122
[explosion]

14:50.185 --> 14:52.185
What was that?

14:52.186 --> 14:56.263
That was the mansion's
reactor, not a good boom.

15:01.336 --> 15:02.336
[explosion]

15:02.337 --> 15:05.906
<i>Falcon: The Skull and M.O.D.O.K. disabled
all of the reactor's safety systems.</i>

15:05.908 --> 15:08.609
<i>Energy discharges have
escaped the shields,</i>

15:08.611 --> 15:11.412
<i>multi-phase generators are
falling out of synchronicity.</i>

15:11.414 --> 15:12.646
<i>Hawkeye: Less geek speak, please, buddy?</i>

15:12.648 --> 15:15.749
Ninety seconds, the reactor blows.

15:15.751 --> 15:18.085
Manhattan goes world's
biggest skate bowl,

15:18.087 --> 15:20.354
and we have a serious P.R. problem.

15:20.356 --> 15:22.323
Really? Now?

15:22.325 --> 15:25.592
Joking in the face of certain
death is part of my charm.

15:25.594 --> 15:29.396
So is being a super genius.
Think, Einstein.

15:29.398 --> 15:30.965
<i>Eighty seconds.</i>

15:34.236 --> 15:38.472
Falcon, we need a coil gun
that can fire a small sun.

15:38.474 --> 15:42.609
You and lightning rod are the pair.  {*corr}
Lots of speed, lots of electricity.

15:42.611 --> 15:45.512
Try to keep up and get
ready to bring the thunder.

15:45.947 --> 15:50.351
He has your spark.
I like him.

15:52.687 --> 15:55.989
Anyone not shielded by armor
or gamma-irradiated skin

15:55.991 --> 15:57.558
should probably clear
the area of civilians.

16:01.396 --> 16:07.034
- Hulk, it's time to get angry.
- My favorite time of day.

16:07.036 --> 16:09.370
It's physics, risky physics.

16:09.372 --> 16:11.939
Tony's betting we can contain
the force of the explosion

16:11.941 --> 16:15.676
and direct it into space like a bullet
from a gun at 3,000 miles per minute.

16:15.678 --> 16:17.010
Does that sound crazy?

16:17.012 --> 16:21.849
- Yes. And also like great fun.
- Let's do it, then.

16:26.454 --> 16:29.656
- Good and angry?
- I'm always angry!

16:29.658 --> 16:31.525
[grunts]

16:31.527 --> 16:35.162
Hard as you can throw it, straight
into the vortex, green guy.

16:35.164 --> 16:38.465
[roars]

16:54.582 --> 16:59.853
Saving New York with science is cool.

16:59.855 --> 17:05.759
Having songs sung about your
bravery is even cooler. Falcon?

17:05.761 --> 17:07.627
The songs shall wait till you wake.

17:16.838 --> 17:20.808
I had stuff in there, you know,
really, really expensive stuff.

17:21.476 --> 17:22.843
Your comic books?

17:24.012 --> 17:25.579
I had them moved to
storage three months ago.

17:25.580 --> 17:29.049
Oh. Okay. We're...
we're cool then.

17:30.452 --> 17:33.120
- Pass out?
- A little.

17:33.122 --> 17:38.625
So, that's it?
Mansion's gone, bad guys gone.

17:38.627 --> 17:40.093
Avengers gone?

17:43.498 --> 17:44.898
Let's talk.

17:48.169 --> 17:49.503
<i>M.O.D.O.K.: We have collected more data.</i>

17:49.505 --> 17:52.707
No more of their weaknesses. {*corr}
We should strike again soon,

17:52.708 --> 17:55.909
<i>before they have time
to regroup and attack us.</i>

17:55.911 --> 17:57.644
Enough!

17:57.646 --> 17:59.513
[screams]

17:59.515 --> 18:04.785
Stark stands with giants!
I must do the same if I am to succeed.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.722
<i>Iron Skull:  If you are
receiving this signal,</i>

18:08.724 --> 18:13.794
<i>consider it a sign of my
respect and a call to arms.</i>

18:13.796 --> 18:16.997
<i>Time and again, we have been
kept from our rightful place</i>

18:16.999 --> 18:19.099
<i>by these so-called Avengers</i>

18:19.101 --> 18:22.769
<i>because we are unable to
put aside petty differences.</i>

18:22.771 --> 18:24.738
<i>If you want your fates to change,</i>

18:24.740 --> 18:28.075
<i>if you want the world
to tremble before you,</i>

18:28.077 --> 18:32.579
<i>stand at my side.
Join my cabal.</i>

18:32.581 --> 18:37.718
And we will destroy
the Avengers, together!

18:41.823 --> 18:45.192
<i>The Skull almost took us out
by teaming with M.O.D.O.K.,</i>

18:45.194 --> 18:47.194
which means he's gonna try again,

18:47.196 --> 18:50.531
but with bigger and badder allies.

18:50.533 --> 18:54.968
- Your robo-butler tell you this?
- No, the Skull did.

18:54.970 --> 18:58.205
S.H.I.E.L.D. intercepted one of these
love letters and passed along the message.

18:58.207 --> 19:03.944
The Skull's building a cabal of
equals to do what he can't do alone.

19:03.946 --> 19:05.761
Just like you guys...
us guys.

19:05.796 --> 19:09.159
Only, you know, evil.
Hmm.

19:10.052 --> 19:11.985
Thanks for clarifying, Sam.

19:11.987 --> 19:14.788
<i>Point is, if the who's who of bad guys</i>

19:14.790 --> 19:17.190
<i>R.S.V.P. to the Skull's revenge party,</i>

19:17.192 --> 19:20.861
the world will be facing
threats of a whole new magnitude.

19:20.863 --> 19:25.198
Threats that only we
can face, the Avengers.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.067
And your way to keep us together

19:27.069 --> 19:29.903
is a super-hero
sleep-over boot camp?

19:29.905 --> 19:33.674
In the army we worked together,
trained together, lived together.

19:33.676 --> 19:36.977
Right, only this isn't the army.

19:38.930 --> 19:42.833
This is our new home,
courtesy of Stark Industries!

19:42.835 --> 19:47.971
Tony, I was thinking something
more Spartan, bare essentials.

19:47.973 --> 19:49.573
Beats my quarters at S.H.I.E.L.D.,

19:49.575 --> 19:51.075
which I lost when I
got fired, by the way.

19:51.077 --> 19:54.545
I have all of Asgard as my home,

19:54.547 --> 19:58.415
you would confine me to this... shack?

19:58.417 --> 20:00.384
Well, I'm going to the ladies room.

20:00.386 --> 20:03.053
Wait, there is no ladies room.
Problem.

20:03.305 --> 20:05.939
Guys, big picture.

20:05.941 --> 20:08.275
If you believe that a small
group of us working together

20:08.277 --> 20:12.346
- can make a difference...
- We just proved that saving New York.

20:12.348 --> 20:16.342
The real question is, if
we follow, will you lead?

20:16.459 --> 20:19.620
You have my word, no backsies this time.

20:19.622 --> 20:21.188
[rumbling]

20:23.124 --> 20:27.961
I'm in. Oh, by the way,
something's wrong with your fridge.

20:29.964 --> 20:33.333
At least S.H.I.E.L.D. has
indestructible doors. Right, Widow?

20:34.769 --> 20:36.737
<i>The disappearing Black Widow, everyone.</i>

20:36.739 --> 20:39.773
Here, then not.
This is gonna be a disaster.

20:39.775 --> 20:42.142
[alarm blaring]

20:42.144 --> 20:44.745
<i>Jarvis:  Gentlemen, the great
wall of China just stood up</i>

20:44.747 --> 20:47.748
<i>and is smashing towards Beijing.
Interested?</i>

20:49.651 --> 20:51.818
Avengers, assemble!

20:51.819 --> 20:53.819
[theme music playing]

21:00.862 --> 21:03.363
[roars]

21:09.671 --> 21:12.673
Jarvis, engage Avenjet Prime.

21:12.675 --> 21:15.676
- What's an "Avenjet Prime"?
- You're standing in it.

21:21.683 --> 21:26.686
This is the best day of my life.
Whoo!

21:26.721 --> 21:28.455
Show off.

21:28.457 --> 21:31.124
What?
Your house doesn't do this?

21:32.276 --> 21:35.254
