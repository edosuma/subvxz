TARA (VOICEOVER): Previously
on "Dance Academy--"

00:04.519 --> 00:06.320
-Are we ever going public?

00:06.360 --> 00:09.640
-What, like holding hands
and swapping chewing gum

00:09.679 --> 00:11.119
under the monkey bars public.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.199
-I don't get it.

00:12.240 --> 00:15.320
You're the best dancer here.

00:15.359 --> 00:19.199
Why do you hate me so much?

00:19.239 --> 00:19.559
-Now!

00:26.440 --> 00:27.199
-Thanks, mate.

00:27.239 --> 00:28.480
-I'm not your mate.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.640
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

00:46.679 --> 00:50.159
Close you eyes.

00:50.200 --> 00:58.119
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.119
This is my chance.

01:00.159 --> 01:05.239
This is my chance, my
chance to feel alive.

01:18.359 --> 01:19.799
TARA (VOICEOVER):
Back in Patchy,

01:19.840 --> 01:23.599
every boy played football, even
though the local team hadn't

01:23.640 --> 01:26.120
won since color TV was invented.

01:26.159 --> 01:29.239
Every Saturday,
people drove 500 Ks

01:29.280 --> 01:34.159
to watch them lose, except me.

01:34.200 --> 01:38.480
I was too busy dancing.

01:38.519 --> 01:43.079
It made no sense, everyone
fighting over a ball.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.599
Why didn't they
just get their own?

01:49.840 --> 01:52.719
ZACH: I know you'll make our
guests from the Sport Institute

01:52.760 --> 01:54.319
feel welcome this week.

01:54.359 --> 01:58.359
The forward squad is here to
work on agility, flexibility,

01:58.400 --> 02:01.319
and balance, which
is a good opportunity

02:01.359 --> 02:03.799
for us to go back to basics.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.200
You'll all benefit
from this exchange,

02:06.239 --> 02:09.680
if you keep an open mind.

02:09.719 --> 02:12.319
En dehors, think out the door.

02:12.360 --> 02:16.800
En dedans, think in they come.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.319
-This just feels wrong.

02:18.360 --> 02:21.680
-I know. [laughing] This
is one seriously gruesome

02:21.719 --> 02:23.159
in they come.

02:23.199 --> 02:25.439
[clearing throat]

02:25.479 --> 02:33.479
-And stay aware of your
position on the floor.

02:44.680 --> 02:45.719
Good.

02:45.759 --> 02:48.800
OK, guys, come
and watch Abigail.

02:48.840 --> 02:51.199
This time, take
it get super slow.

02:55.599 --> 02:59.319
Look at that-- absolute
concentration on technique.

03:03.159 --> 03:07.400
Interesting, quited turned
in a the hips, aren't you?

03:07.439 --> 03:11.599
This is why it's good to slow it
down, helps you spot the flaws.

03:11.639 --> 03:12.840
-I'm Ollie.

03:12.879 --> 03:15.080
What am I supposed to
be doing with my hips?

03:15.120 --> 03:17.599
-Uh, avoid using
them as a weapon.

03:17.639 --> 03:19.319
-Easy for you to say--

03:19.360 --> 03:20.719
-Kat.

03:20.759 --> 03:22.120
-Easy for you to say, Kat.

03:29.199 --> 03:29.840
-I saw teeth action.

03:29.879 --> 03:30.639
-No.

03:30.680 --> 03:31.800
No, you didn't.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.199
I am a guy-free zone these days.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.560
-Uh-huh

03:35.599 --> 03:38.639
-And sometimes, a
smile is just a smile.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.599
Yeah, because that smile
showed absolute concentration

03:41.639 --> 03:43.080
on techniques.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.800
-Tara, you and Abigail
are doing private classes

03:45.840 --> 03:47.439
with me, every night this week.

03:47.479 --> 03:50.479
-But I'm already
doing extra classes.

03:50.520 --> 03:51.599
-You're right.

03:51.639 --> 03:52.639
We wouldn't want you
to feel overworked.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.759
-Really?

03:54.800 --> 03:56.759
-How can you be OK with this?

03:56.800 --> 03:58.319
-You still don't get it.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.599
Only favorites get
this kind of attention.

04:00.639 --> 04:05.400
If you didn't have
potential, you'd be ignored.

04:05.439 --> 04:06.159
I know.

04:06.199 --> 04:09.520
I can't believe it either.

04:09.560 --> 04:14.639
-This is dance of manly
men, men of the passion

04:14.680 --> 04:16.160
and the strength.

04:16.199 --> 04:22.160
Give me strong
eyes, strong jaws.

04:22.199 --> 04:33.680
[russian] Like men,
dance like men!

04:33.720 --> 04:35.639
Where is man?

04:35.680 --> 04:38.319
More with the focusing.

04:38.360 --> 04:42.480
[russian]

04:42.519 --> 04:49.480
[cheering and laughing]

04:49.519 --> 04:54.480
-(IMITATING TEACHER) Is the
dance for ze men, like men,

04:54.519 --> 04:55.720
dance like men.

04:58.480 --> 05:01.360
-Hey, ballet boy, can I
borrow your puffy shirt?

05:01.399 --> 05:02.800
-Sorry, uh I missed that.

05:02.839 --> 05:04.120
I don't speak meat head.

05:06.439 --> 05:07.600
-Who you calling a meat head?

05:07.639 --> 05:09.600
-Yeah, if you had
brains, you'd back off.

05:09.639 --> 05:10.800
-What are you going to do?

05:10.839 --> 05:13.240
You gonna sparkly
fingers me to death?

05:13.279 --> 05:15.480
-Yeah, um it's--
it's spirit fingers.

05:15.519 --> 05:17.279
-Yeah, well your
little friend there, he

05:17.319 --> 05:18.439
seems to like that dance.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.639
The girl part suits him.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.560
-You better watch yourself
there, pretty boy.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.800
-That's enough!

05:23.839 --> 05:25.240
What's the issue?

05:25.279 --> 05:27.519
Ethan?

05:27.560 --> 05:29.560
-They get all the
funding, all the press.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.279
They wouldn't know hard work
if it hit them in the face.

05:31.319 --> 05:33.600
-Hey, two minutes on a footie
field, and you'd be dead.

05:33.639 --> 05:34.600
-Yeah.

05:34.639 --> 05:35.600
Try dancing on your [inaudible].

05:35.639 --> 05:36.600
-Dancing is a sport for girls.

05:36.639 --> 05:37.800
-Seem like you didn't hear me.

05:37.839 --> 05:39.240
These guys are our
guests for the week.

05:39.279 --> 05:41.319
That's not going to change.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.399
I don't care how you
do it, but you're all

05:43.439 --> 05:45.160
going to find a
way to sort it out.

05:50.199 --> 05:55.680
-Toughest sport,
footballers versus dancers.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.120
Except, there's not competition.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.439
We're fitter, faster--

05:59.480 --> 06:01.319
-And stronger.

06:01.360 --> 06:06.600
This Friday, the gypsy dance the
whole way through, no mistakes.

06:06.639 --> 06:11.480
-Friday, here, touch
football, not even their code.

06:11.519 --> 06:13.360
They can score as
many times they like.

06:13.399 --> 06:14.759
But if we score once, we win.

06:20.519 --> 06:22.160
-It's just a dance.

06:22.199 --> 06:25.480
I mean, any moron can dance.

06:28.519 --> 06:30.720
-Hello, you.

06:30.759 --> 06:33.240
-Hello.

06:33.279 --> 06:34.319
-I don't have time.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.800
-Me either, I'm very busy.

06:37.839 --> 06:39.800
-I'm doing privates
with Ms. Raine.

06:39.839 --> 06:43.160
-Hey, that's awesome.

06:43.199 --> 06:46.839
-It feels like everything
is finally coming together,

06:46.879 --> 06:50.560
which is why there's not going
to be anymore sneaking around.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.079
-Brilliant, I'm not
naturally stealth.

06:58.319 --> 07:00.160
-Look, Sammy,
there are two types

07:00.199 --> 07:02.600
of girls at the
academy-- girls who

07:02.639 --> 07:06.560
are serious about ballet and
girls who have boyfriends.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.800
-I'm not gonna interfere
with your dancing.

07:08.839 --> 07:11.360
-Obviously, that's my point.

07:32.639 --> 07:34.399
MS. RAINE: Prepare for get jete.

07:37.439 --> 07:39.800
Yes, Tara.

07:39.839 --> 07:41.199
Focus, Abigail.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.399
Eyes off the mirror.

07:43.439 --> 07:44.720
Yes, that's it.

07:44.759 --> 07:45.720
Good, Tara.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.639
Thank you.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.240
Tara, watch your line coming
out of the grand jete.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.720
-What should I
work on, Ms. Raine?

08:08.480 --> 08:11.560
-I find it easier, if I
focus on my supporting leg.

08:14.480 --> 08:18.839
-It's obvious what she's
doing, creating competition,

08:18.879 --> 08:21.319
using me to make me work harder.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.720
-Really?

08:22.759 --> 08:24.439
What was it about favorites
getting all the attention.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.399
And everybody else
being ignored?

08:32.080 --> 08:34.519
So footie grudge match--

08:34.558 --> 08:35.799
-Mm-hm.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.200
-Yeah.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.080
I'm so not a team
sport person, you know,

08:39.120 --> 08:40.639
the whole hand-eye coordination.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.120
-Look, I gotta go.

08:42.159 --> 08:43.200
-Yeah, me too.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.600
-I think he's interesting.

08:50.639 --> 08:52.399
-Who, Christian?

08:52.440 --> 08:55.679
-Ah, Ollie, he's
hot, kind of quirky.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.480
-Soft hands.

08:58.519 --> 08:59.639
-Uh--

08:59.679 --> 09:02.039
-In passing the ball,
keep you hands soft.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.720
--[clearing throat] So uh
was it love, you and Ms.

09:04.759 --> 09:06.039
Raine's special private time?

09:06.080 --> 09:07.480
-It was weird.

09:07.519 --> 09:10.320
I don't know how I'm gonna
cope with Abigail five nights

09:10.360 --> 09:11.320
a week.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.360
-You?

09:12.399 --> 09:13.279
You're doing privates
with Abigail?

09:13.320 --> 09:13.639
-Yeah.

09:20.840 --> 09:24.120
-Hm, soft hands, hey?

09:29.240 --> 09:30.840
-Enough with the stealth.

09:30.879 --> 09:32.399
-Could you maybe
keep your voice down?

09:32.440 --> 09:34.639
-Tara just told me she's
doing privates with you.

09:34.679 --> 09:35.679
-So?

09:35.720 --> 09:36.639
-So love here as
I do, the girl's

09:36.679 --> 09:38.240
a relationship train wreck.

09:38.279 --> 09:41.039
And Ms. Raine's still taking
here seriously as a dancer.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.759
If Tara can be a
favorite with her.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.159
Then you going
out with me is not

09:44.200 --> 09:46.720
going to ruin your reputation.

09:46.759 --> 09:53.600
-But don't you think all
this secrecy is kind of hot?

09:53.639 --> 09:57.159
-Really, hot?

09:57.200 --> 09:59.320
-No no, not hot.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.600
I feel used and violated.

10:00.639 --> 10:03.440
You can't kiss someone and
pretend it's irrelevant.

10:03.480 --> 10:04.759
It means something.

10:04.799 --> 10:06.639
-It's just lips on other lips

10:06.679 --> 10:08.399
-I know you don't mean that.

10:10.759 --> 10:14.559
-Hey, you, sports person--

10:14.600 --> 10:15.559
-Me?

10:15.600 --> 10:16.480
Can you wait there a second?

10:32.480 --> 10:34.080
[laughing]

11:30.200 --> 11:31.799
-We should talk.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.639
-We should pretend the
other doesn't exist.

11:37.639 --> 11:41.200
-Yeah, we could do that.

11:41.240 --> 11:45.159
-For the love of
all things human.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.799
-How's the coffee here?

11:46.840 --> 11:49.679
-Brown and wet.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.799
-Right.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.159
-I should probably
get going my uh rond

11:54.200 --> 11:55.639
de jambe's crying
out for attention.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.799
-See?

12:02.840 --> 12:05.840
You kissed him, and now
he's fallen for you.

12:05.879 --> 12:06.679
I'm right.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.399
I means something.

12:09.440 --> 12:13.799
Look, you might hide it, but
you have feelings for me.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.759
-Haven't you figured
it out by now?

12:15.799 --> 12:16.759
I don't do feelings.

12:22.399 --> 12:32.399
[music playing]

12:32.440 --> 12:42.399
[music playing]

12:42.440 --> 12:52.399
[music playing]

12:52.440 --> 13:00.679
[music playing]

13:00.720 --> 13:02.840
CHRISTIAN: Yeah, yeah, Ethan.

13:02.879 --> 13:03.480
Ethan!

13:07.799 --> 13:09.720
-What was that?

13:09.759 --> 13:10.720
Score line was open.

13:10.759 --> 13:12.039
-No, you were hogging the ball.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.559
-Oh, so you didn't
get to be the hero.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.720
-You know, you've
always held on too long.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.799
-Don't bash it out.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.559
Are you trying to
make it look ugly?

13:25.600 --> 13:27.679
Tara, show her.

13:35.399 --> 13:41.440
This is what it's supposed to
look like, clean technique.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.200
Um, I can do it better.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.480
-I mean, just-- just
think about like you're

13:48.519 --> 13:50.639
going up for a mark.

13:50.679 --> 13:51.519
Let's try it again.

13:58.679 --> 13:59.639
Maybe not.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.440
Kat, help.

14:06.480 --> 14:09.080
-Oh, no can do.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.120
You guys are the enemy.

14:10.159 --> 14:13.639
-Yeah, we're also terrible.

14:13.679 --> 14:15.399
-Yeah.

14:15.440 --> 14:15.759
-Please.

14:19.559 --> 14:20.480
-Oh.

14:20.519 --> 14:22.519
-We can do the, right.

14:22.559 --> 14:23.639
Right?

14:23.679 --> 14:25.200
-Right.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.360
-Go, I got it, I got it.

14:36.200 --> 14:41.679
-Pose arabesque-- (YELLING)
hips, Abigail, turn them out.

14:41.720 --> 14:44.600
Abigail, this is
ballet, not gymnastics.

14:44.639 --> 14:45.759
Square your hips.

14:45.799 --> 14:48.320
Do you even know
where they're facing?

14:48.360 --> 14:50.519
Will you stop looking
in the mirror?

14:50.559 --> 14:52.080
Turn out your legs.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.480
How long have you been dancing?

14:54.519 --> 14:57.159
Stop!

14:57.200 --> 14:58.399
Can you not hear me, Abigail?

14:58.440 --> 15:00.639
Am I not speaking
clearly enough.

15:00.679 --> 15:01.720
-It makes it harder.

15:04.679 --> 15:07.440
-Excuse me?

15:07.480 --> 15:12.200
-What you're doing, when you do
it to me, it makes it harder.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.360
-Really?

15:13.399 --> 15:15.399
You were quite happy
to show her up earlier.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.200
-Uh I didn't--

15:16.240 --> 15:18.480
-Don't look so shocked.

15:18.519 --> 15:21.120
To be a professional, you
have to be a competitor.

15:21.159 --> 15:24.679
I'm relieved you finally
figured that out.

15:24.720 --> 15:28.080
If you object to my teaching,
you are free to leave.

15:37.759 --> 15:38.480
Again, Abigail.

15:41.360 --> 15:54.559
[crying]

15:54.600 --> 15:55.200
-Company?

16:02.840 --> 16:05.559
-That thing yesterday
was a social experiment,

16:05.600 --> 16:07.120
just so you know.

16:07.159 --> 16:12.120
-Ooh, I picked out a
ring and everything.

16:12.159 --> 16:14.240
Rough day?

16:14.279 --> 16:16.279
-You wouldn't get it.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.399
-Cause I'm a meat head?

16:18.440 --> 16:20.759
-Because you're not a dancer.

16:20.799 --> 16:22.720
You don't have
physical limitations

16:22.759 --> 16:24.720
that can't be overcome.

16:24.759 --> 16:29.320
-Someone taller, faster, jumps
a bit higher, hits a bit harder.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.600
-The naturals.

16:33.639 --> 16:36.120
-Is it wrong to hate them?

16:36.159 --> 16:39.360
-Not if you ask me.

16:39.399 --> 16:44.720
What I want to know is
how you compete with them.

16:44.759 --> 16:46.480
-I work harder.

16:46.519 --> 16:47.519
I train for longer.

16:47.559 --> 16:49.639
You know, and I
don't beat myself up,

16:49.679 --> 16:50.799
when I can't do what they do.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.159
And that's enough.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.320
-For you maybe.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.799
-So you and that Sammy guy--

17:01.840 --> 17:03.559
-There is no me and Sammy.

17:16.839 --> 17:20.039
-How am I doing?

17:20.079 --> 17:21.759
-[laughing] That's great.

17:24.358 --> 17:31.240
-Um what would happen if I were
to ask you out, hypothetically?

17:31.279 --> 17:33.519
-Um on a date thing?

17:33.559 --> 17:35.720
-On a date thing.

17:35.759 --> 17:37.519
-Hypothetically--

17:37.559 --> 17:40.480
-The Rooftop Cinema has a Three
Stooges marathon on tonight.

17:40.519 --> 17:43.680
It could be fun.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.640
-I might say yes,
hypothetically.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.599
-No way.

17:48.640 --> 17:49.759
-You've been helping them out.

17:49.799 --> 17:51.160
-Oh, relax, Ethan.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.480
They're still terrible.

17:52.519 --> 17:54.799
-It's good to see where
your loyalties lie, Kat.

17:54.839 --> 17:55.440
Nice.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.400
-Boyfriend or ex?

18:00.440 --> 18:02.119
-Yuck um ew no.

18:02.160 --> 18:05.599
Brother, and I do
have to go after him.

18:05.640 --> 18:09.319
So Stooges rain check?

18:09.359 --> 18:10.559
-Yeah.

18:10.599 --> 18:11.200
-Cool.

18:28.839 --> 18:30.240
-What, you're so
good now you can

18:30.279 --> 18:31.799
afford to be late for class?

18:31.839 --> 18:33.359
-No, I'm not going.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.160
You win.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.200
You get to be the favorite.

18:37.599 --> 18:40.640
-You can't even competing
with nature on your side.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.359
You don't deserve what you have.

18:48.799 --> 18:50.240
-OK.

18:50.279 --> 18:51.680
To win their part
of the challenge,

18:51.720 --> 18:55.839
the guys have to get through
the whole dance, every step.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.160
Start and finish together.

18:57.200 --> 18:57.680
Are we ready?

19:29.839 --> 19:31.599
-Well, their technique sucks.

19:31.640 --> 19:34.319
They've got zero rhythm.

19:34.359 --> 19:35.720
-Doing all the steps though.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.640
-Hey!

19:41.680 --> 19:42.640
-Yow!

19:42.680 --> 19:43.319
Yeah!

20:15.759 --> 20:18.319
-This is what we trained for.

20:18.359 --> 20:23.200
Now is when the sweat and
dirt and pain pay off.

20:23.240 --> 20:28.599
We're elite athletes competing
in a tough physical sport.

20:28.640 --> 20:29.799
I know you guys have it in you.

20:29.839 --> 20:30.480
-We're toast.

20:53.799 --> 21:00.400
[cheering]

21:00.440 --> 21:01.400
-Hold him!

21:01.440 --> 21:02.240
Get him!

21:02.279 --> 21:03.720
Mates, where are you?

21:03.759 --> 21:05.400
-Woo!

21:05.440 --> 21:07.359
Woohoo!

21:07.400 --> 21:07.720
Yeah!

21:10.200 --> 21:11.279
-Sammy, where were you?

21:26.839 --> 21:31.759
[cheering]

21:31.799 --> 21:32.480
-All right.

21:32.519 --> 21:34.440
All good.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.200
-It's all right.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.599
-You guys are doing well.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.039
ETHAN: Time out.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.799
Hey, time out.

21:39.839 --> 21:43.799
Kat, Kat-- guys, walk away.

21:43.839 --> 21:45.359
What was that?

21:45.400 --> 21:48.400
-He's poking me.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.200
-You know them.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.680
We only need one try to win.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.279
I'm not your spy.

21:54.319 --> 21:56.480
And you guys are
all way beyond help.

21:56.519 --> 21:58.200
-Hey, how about
you pass the ball.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.759
-Yeah well, if you
provided a lead.

21:59.799 --> 22:00.640
-Come on.

22:00.680 --> 22:01.759
It's not rocket science.

22:01.799 --> 22:02.839
They work together,
help each other.

22:02.880 --> 22:06.640
You know, like an actual team?

22:06.680 --> 22:08.119
Come on, guys, team work.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.200
ETHAN: Thanks for your help.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.200
Last chance, it's almost time.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.680
CHRISTIAN: Ethan, Ethan!

22:27.680 --> 22:28.640
-Go Sammy!

22:33.160 --> 22:33.720
[cheering]

22:33.759 --> 22:36.599
KAT: Go Sammy!

22:36.640 --> 22:38.599
[cheering]

22:38.640 --> 22:39.200
-Sammy!

22:42.119 --> 22:44.440
TARA (VOICEOVER): In ballet,
there is not scoreboard.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.720
But we are competing,
every single day,

22:47.759 --> 22:49.799
even if we prefer
not to admit it.

22:49.839 --> 22:51.759
-Who knew they had it in them?

22:51.799 --> 22:54.839
-Must have been that inspiring
rev up you gave them.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.039
-So uh I saw that
the Three Stooges

22:57.079 --> 22:58.440
thing is on tonight too.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.160
-Is that right?

23:00.200 --> 23:01.720
TARA (VOICEOVER):
At some point, we'll

23:01.759 --> 23:04.599
stop training and
have to go on stage,

23:04.640 --> 23:09.319
figure out how to
work together, let go.

23:09.359 --> 23:10.160
-Nice pass.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.160
-Yeah, pretty good, wasn't it?

23:17.480 --> 23:18.079
-OK.

23:23.759 --> 23:26.279
-Can I have your
phone number too?

23:26.319 --> 23:27.480
-Why?

23:27.519 --> 23:28.920
-I don't know.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.559
I though we could hang out,
watch a movie or something.

23:32.519 --> 23:35.480
-Oh, right.

23:35.519 --> 23:36.599
Uh--

23:36.640 --> 23:38.599
-You're not interested?

23:38.640 --> 23:41.240
-I'm not available.

23:41.279 --> 23:41.799
-Sorry.

23:41.839 --> 23:43.559
-Good game.

23:43.599 --> 23:46.559
TARA (VOICEOVER): It's then
that it stops being a sport

23:46.599 --> 23:47.400
and becomes an art.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.400
-Oh, whoa!

23:49.440 --> 23:52.400
Oh!

23:52.440 --> 23:54.359
-Um what--

23:54.400 --> 24:00.160
[cheering]

24:00.200 --> 24:03.079
TARA (VOICEOVER): And maybe
we'll surprise ourselves.

24:05.599 --> 24:05.720
[theme music]
