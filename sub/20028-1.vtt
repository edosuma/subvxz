03:33.297 --> 03:34.089
Hello.

03:38.636 --> 03:39.762
Hi, Coach.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.972
In class, it's Mr. Sullivan.

03:46.435 --> 03:47.436
Hello, everyone.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.148
Welcome to Grade 11 Chemistry.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.360
I can tell what you're thinking:

03:54.485 --> 03:57.154
another boring class.

03:58.656 --> 03:59.865
You're wrong.

04:00.658 --> 04:02.368
What's fascinating about chemistry,

04:02.493 --> 04:04.119
what makes it wonderful,

04:05.120 --> 04:07.498
is we can put its theory into practice.

04:10.501 --> 04:14.338
These are metal salts combusting with methanol.

04:14.672 --> 04:17.675
They're used to make fireworks.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.678
This looks tame,

04:20.803 --> 04:22.053
harmless.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.055
But...

04:28.811 --> 04:32.356
what if I set fire to this liquid? Anyone?

04:40.030 --> 04:41.699
It's more violent.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.870
Anyone interested in a demonstration next week?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.376
Take out your books.

04:57.506 --> 04:58.257
Excuse us, sir.

04:58.382 --> 04:59.049
Yes?

04:59.174 --> 05:01.427
Francis and I would like to do an experiment

05:01.552 --> 05:03.137
during your demo.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.431
There's not much time to prepare.

05:05.556 --> 05:06.557
No problem.

05:06.682 --> 05:08.100
Need any help?

05:08.225 --> 05:09.727
All good. Thanks.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.562
So cool he said yes.

05:11.687 --> 05:14.064
Let's make something unreal!

05:15.190 --> 05:17.276
We could combine a few things?

05:17.401 --> 05:20.070
Yeah! It'll be sick!

05:21.572 --> 05:22.740
Later.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.410
Hi!

05:26.952 --> 05:27.786
How are you?

05:27.911 --> 05:28.912
Good, you?

05:36.462 --> 05:37.421
Dad?

05:38.714 --> 05:40.466
I'll eat later!

05:40.883 --> 05:41.884
Why?

05:43.761 --> 05:46.430
Gotta test something out for Chemistry.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.101
Be careful.

05:51.226 --> 05:51.852
Sure.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.103
Don't be late.

05:53.228 --> 05:53.979
I won't.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.863
Mr. Sullivan isn't ready for our project.

06:02.988 --> 06:03.739
I know.

06:04.448 --> 06:06.992
He is not ready for it!

06:08.786 --> 06:10.454
I read up online

06:10.579 --> 06:12.623
to improve it.

06:12.998 --> 06:13.999
A lot of options,

06:14.124 --> 06:16.126
but the only thing we can pull off

06:16.251 --> 06:19.046
is adding fireworks

06:19.171 --> 06:20.881
and a G.I. Joe.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.341
Found one, by the way.

06:22.466 --> 06:23.258
Show me.

06:29.348 --> 06:30.808
Film this.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.144
Tim's experiment, number...

06:34.269 --> 06:35.020
52.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.021
52.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.148
Dry ice...

06:38.482 --> 06:40.609
when mixed with water, what do you get?

07:09.054 --> 07:10.806
Did you see that?!

07:21.316 --> 07:24.069
The bottle was disintegrated!

07:25.028 --> 07:26.738
Don't try this at home.

07:26.864 --> 07:27.698
Again!

07:39.209 --> 07:40.252
Like that?

07:40.377 --> 07:41.211
A little surprise package.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.464
5? For all that?

07:43.589 --> 07:45.174
Including that?

07:53.015 --> 07:54.099
Oh my God!

07:54.224 --> 07:56.226
Experiment 103.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.644
When meatballs hit your face,

07:57.769 --> 07:58.896
what do you get?

08:01.064 --> 08:03.609
Tim! It's just a joke, man!

08:06.695 --> 08:08.989
That was sick!

08:09.114 --> 08:10.908
Let me see that!

08:17.748 --> 08:19.625
One week and they're already at it.

08:19.750 --> 08:20.792
Forget them.

08:20.918 --> 08:23.295
Did that for 4 years, hasn't changed jack shit.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.880
Check this out, bro.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.760
Just focus on your own things.

08:33.639 --> 08:36.767
Can you do anything other than backflips?

08:37.100 --> 08:39.520
You guys gonna make out with Jen?

08:39.645 --> 08:40.479
Shut up, Syd.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.272
What? Got your balls chopped off?

08:42.397 --> 08:43.440
What's your problem?

08:47.819 --> 08:49.279
I'm sure you've got balls.

08:49.613 --> 08:50.656
He won't stop.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.407
Big ones too.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.247
<i>You've been tagged in a video</i>

09:00.290 --> 09:01.416
Look at this!

09:02.793 --> 09:04.461
<i>This is just for you.</i>

09:14.304 --> 09:15.430
Francine!

09:15.764 --> 09:17.808
Go wipe Timmy's tears.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.842
What does your dad think of us coming here?

09:56.680 --> 09:57.472
Nothing.

10:01.476 --> 10:02.686
He doesn't mind?

10:08.692 --> 10:11.737
He suggested I find a place

10:11.862 --> 10:13.030
to do my experiments.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.205
Does he wonder?

10:28.503 --> 10:29.504
About what?

10:34.176 --> 10:36.845
Us being here, alone, hidden.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.061
We're not hiding.

10:48.899 --> 10:49.900
We're not?

10:58.909 --> 11:00.285
He doesn't know you're here.

11:03.914 --> 11:04.748
Why not?

11:09.920 --> 11:11.922
He doesn't need to know everything.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.928
Know what?

11:18.595 --> 11:20.639
Nothing, just drop it.

11:20.764 --> 11:21.765
Gotta piss.

13:58.713 --> 13:59.714
Hi, guys.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.886
Tell me when you're ready.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.764
It's a one shot deal. We'll wait for everyone.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.141
What do you mean?

14:10.267 --> 14:12.811
Grade 11 students said they'd come.

14:12.936 --> 14:15.146
I don't want to burst your bubble,

14:15.272 --> 14:17.482
but Grade 11's are quite forgetful.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.151
They might come.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.820
Hurry up, we're about to start.

14:21.945 --> 14:22.988
Same experiment?

14:23.113 --> 14:25.365
Yeah, but we vamped it up.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.908
Can't wait to see.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.834
Sullivan's demo started.

14:42.632 --> 14:43.592
Check this out.

14:44.134 --> 14:46.136
Sullivan's doing some really cool stuff.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.513
Let me see!

14:51.975 --> 14:54.144
You should really be more careful.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.869
Girls, come in, put on some glasses.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.163
Everyone against the wall.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.790
No one else will show up.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.667
They're just kids.

15:20.795 --> 15:21.671
They won't come.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.006
Let's start.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.191
Block your ears.

15:50.909 --> 15:54.412
In 3, 2, 1.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.553
Time to go back to class.

16:10.679 --> 16:11.763
Thank you for coming.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.431
Leave the glasses.

16:14.724 --> 16:15.600
Thank you.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.397
Have a good afternoon.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.775
We're fucking losers.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.861
Screw you man.

16:29.572 --> 16:30.865
You're on your own.

16:35.912 --> 16:36.871
You filming?

16:43.795 --> 16:45.505
Will you shut the fuck up!

16:45.630 --> 16:46.798
What? You a sissy?

16:46.923 --> 16:47.799
Yes, I am!

16:47.924 --> 16:49.259
Want me to say I'm a fag?

16:49.384 --> 16:50.885
Yes, I'm a fucking fag!

16:55.640 --> 16:57.267
You must be too.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.646
No way. I didn't know shit.

17:01.771 --> 17:02.981
Shut up! You knew.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.941
You shut up! I had no fucking clue!

17:06.401 --> 17:07.484
Francis, you're a fag?

17:07.609 --> 17:09.445
Why didn't you ever tell me?

17:16.118 --> 17:17.328
<i>Want me to say I'm a fag?</i>

17:17.454 --> 17:18.872
<i>Yes, I'm a fucking fag!</i>

17:18.997 --> 17:20.498
<i>You must be too.</i>

17:36.806 --> 17:38.516
Why did you say that in front of everyone?

17:38.641 --> 17:40.018
They're sharing your fucking video!

17:40.143 --> 17:41.978
They'll think I'm also...

17:42.812 --> 17:43.646
What?

17:44.439 --> 17:45.523
That you're what?

17:45.648 --> 17:46.691
Shut up.

17:46.816 --> 17:47.984
Fuck, say it!

17:48.359 --> 17:50.028
You're a fucking faggot! Say it!
- Shut up!

17:50.153 --> 17:51.821
You're a fag too! You know it!

17:51.946 --> 17:54.324
Shut up! It's not true!

18:44.541 --> 18:45.917
What are you doing?

18:46.543 --> 18:47.544
Stop that!

18:48.044 --> 18:48.920
Give me the marker.

18:49.504 --> 18:50.505
Marker!

18:51.381 --> 18:52.549
Principal's office.

19:12.902 --> 19:13.570
Sir.

19:13.903 --> 19:14.737
He didn't do anything.

19:14.863 --> 19:15.780
Get back there.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.740
He was trying to cover up a drawing.

19:18.575 --> 19:19.409
What drawing?

19:21.911 --> 19:22.954
There was nothing.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.934
Hey Francine.

19:45.476 --> 19:48.605
The girl's locker room is next door.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.482
Move it along guys!

19:51.941 --> 19:52.942
Hurry up.

19:53.276 --> 19:54.611
It's an endurance test today.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.946
Francis, hurry up.

19:57.906 --> 19:58.990
Let's go, Tim.

19:59.490 --> 20:00.783
Hurry up, everyone!

20:08.499 --> 20:09.751
<i>Level 5!</i>

20:21.095 --> 20:22.013
Careful, Francis.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.848
You miss the next beep, you're out.

20:24.474 --> 20:25.308
You can do it.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.773
Level 7, don't stop now!

20:37.987 --> 20:38.988
Good job, Francis.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.406
Already out, Cinderella?

20:40.531 --> 20:41.532
Pat!

20:41.866 --> 20:43.326
Focus on running.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.501
Let's go, everyone!

20:57.173 --> 20:58.383
Sorry, you were so slow,

20:58.508 --> 20:59.842
I thought you were stopping.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.726
Level 12!

21:10.728 --> 21:12.021
Level 13, guys!

21:14.023 --> 21:15.733
Keep going, Jen. Excellent!

21:17.485 --> 21:19.028
Level 14.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.863
Keep it up!

21:21.823 --> 21:23.908
Good job! Don't stop, Jen!

21:28.204 --> 21:31.040
Tim, follow the beeps, don't tire yourself.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.418
You're nearing the school record!

21:33.543 --> 21:34.919
Don't give up!

21:35.044 --> 21:37.005
Come on, Pat!

21:39.716 --> 21:41.676
Great job, Pat.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.304
You're the last one standing!

21:44.429 --> 21:45.888
Go hard!

22:02.405 --> 22:03.614
Don't give up! Go!

22:21.215 --> 22:23.092
You just beat the school record!

22:36.898 --> 22:37.648
Hey!

22:40.443 --> 22:42.445
You're a running machine!

22:43.112 --> 22:45.448
You really showed Pat.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.453
I'm Jennifer, by the way.

22:53.289 --> 22:56.000
Usually the guy says, "Hi Jen, I'm..."

22:56.125 --> 22:56.918
Tim!

22:58.002 --> 22:59.462
Can we talk?

23:00.129 --> 23:01.005
Let's go to my office.

23:12.934 --> 23:15.686
I saw you win provincials when you were 12.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.484
I understand why you stopped, but...

23:22.944 --> 23:24.320
it's good to see you running again.

23:25.363 --> 23:27.115
Actually, I'm not.

23:28.825 --> 23:29.826
You should.

23:31.285 --> 23:32.453
Don't you miss it?

23:32.829 --> 23:35.164
Training, the competition rush...

23:40.169 --> 23:43.631
I'll never be as good a coach as your mom,
but...

23:45.508 --> 23:47.301
Come train with us?

23:48.886 --> 23:50.179
I don't run anymore.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.181
It's a shame.

24:13.995 --> 24:15.997
What's the rush? Relax.

24:17.248 --> 24:19.000
Just want to say congrats.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.378
Heard you beat my record.

24:23.546 --> 24:24.422
Good job.

24:27.341 --> 24:29.010
Pretty fucked up, huh?

24:30.344 --> 24:32.763
That record went unbroken for 13 years.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.933
Then, bang, I beat it last year.

24:38.269 --> 24:39.770
And this year, it's you.

24:42.899 --> 24:45.026
Anyway, congrats.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.238
Whoa!

24:51.908 --> 24:53.993
Little party in the lockers.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.912
Come check it out.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.585
Let me out!

25:02.919 --> 25:03.794
Help me!

25:04.754 --> 25:07.423
Get me the fuck out!

25:16.807 --> 25:17.808
Let him out!

25:17.934 --> 25:18.976
Get out of the way!

25:19.101 --> 25:20.269
Get the fuck off!

25:22.605 --> 25:23.940
Let me out!

25:25.816 --> 25:26.943
Out of the way!

25:27.318 --> 25:29.237
Move over!

25:31.447 --> 25:32.323
Alright!

25:33.449 --> 25:34.158
You're okay.

25:34.283 --> 25:34.951
We got you.

25:35.076 --> 25:35.952
You okay?

25:36.953 --> 25:38.120
Who did this?

25:41.123 --> 25:42.625
Go with him.

25:43.459 --> 25:44.627
Who did this?

25:52.510 --> 25:54.011
Bathroom's closed.

25:54.136 --> 25:55.096
Who did it?

25:56.097 --> 25:57.181
I don't know.

25:57.306 --> 25:58.975
You serious? Who was it?

25:59.308 --> 26:00.184
I'm no snitch.

26:00.309 --> 26:01.310
Really?

26:01.852 --> 26:04.522
They stuck your friend in a locker.

26:04.647 --> 26:07.191
Now, he's terrified. Why protect them?

26:07.316 --> 26:08.985
None of your business.

26:09.110 --> 26:11.737
It's my business when students get bullied.

26:11.862 --> 26:13.489
Yeah but then,

26:13.614 --> 26:15.741
I'm next on their list,

26:15.866 --> 26:17.493
and it'll be so much worse!

26:27.670 --> 26:28.838
<i>You okay?</i>

26:50.359 --> 26:52.653
<i>Lunch together?</i>

27:00.202 --> 27:02.538
<i>You've reached: Francis Gagnon.</i>

27:03.164 --> 27:05.166
It's me. Where are you?

27:05.875 --> 27:06.751
Call me.

28:13.109 --> 28:14.235
Stop!

28:16.153 --> 28:17.238
Don't do it!

28:18.989 --> 28:19.740
Go away!

28:31.293 --> 28:32.795
Don't do it!
- Go away.

28:33.337 --> 28:34.922
Please get down!

28:35.256 --> 28:36.465
Leave me alone.

28:37.258 --> 28:38.175
Get down from there!

28:38.300 --> 28:39.677
It won't stop. It's everywhere.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.595
It's not worth it! Don't do it!

28:44.265 --> 28:46.183
Get the fuck down!

28:46.809 --> 28:47.685
I love you.

29:33.522 --> 29:34.523
Tim, come.

29:35.858 --> 29:36.692
Come on.

29:46.869 --> 29:48.871
We're gathered here

29:51.165 --> 29:53.709
because I have some bad news.

29:54.335 --> 29:55.920
Yesterday, Francis Gagnon,

29:56.045 --> 29:57.713
a grade 11 student,

29:58.214 --> 30:00.216
took his own life.

30:08.098 --> 30:10.017
If you need...

30:10.559 --> 30:12.061
to talk...

30:15.898 --> 30:19.610
Carol, our psychotherapist...

30:19.735 --> 30:21.737
is available.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.743
We're not here to blame anyone.

30:28.577 --> 30:32.581
We want to understand why he did it.

30:33.123 --> 30:34.083
Okay?

30:46.595 --> 30:48.138
They're all hypocrites.

30:48.931 --> 30:51.392
They're all hypocrites, but who?

30:51.934 --> 30:52.810
Tell me more.

30:52.935 --> 30:55.396
Tell you more? I can't.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.481
You might be the king here,

30:57.606 --> 30:59.775
yet you don't get how a school works!

31:00.317 --> 31:02.820
There are 2 ways to solve one's problems:

31:03.654 --> 31:05.990
either shut up and do nothing,

31:06.323 --> 31:07.825
or shut up and deal with it yourself.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.034
I pick the 2nd one.

31:09.159 --> 31:11.620
There are other solutions. We're here for that.

31:11.745 --> 31:12.788
You're not!

31:12.913 --> 31:14.915
We all failed Francis!

31:15.833 --> 31:17.126
I failed him.

32:12.056 --> 32:14.475
<i>In memory of Francis Gagnon - 16</i>

32:47.174 --> 32:48.217
Are you okay?

32:51.261 --> 32:52.888
Sorry about Francis.

32:56.517 --> 32:58.018
Can I do anything?

33:38.934 --> 33:39.810
<i>Jeff, congratulations.</i>

33:39.935 --> 33:40.644
<i>Thanks.</i>

33:40.769 --> 33:42.312
<i>Provincial champ once again.</i>

33:42.438 --> 33:43.313
<i>That's right!</i>

33:43.772 --> 33:44.606
<i>What's next?</i>

33:45.315 --> 33:47.151
<i>Hopefully, the Olympics one day!</i>

33:47.276 --> 33:49.695
<i>For now, the Nationals next summer.</i>

33:49.820 --> 33:52.281
<i>Only one spot per province and it's mine.</i>

33:53.574 --> 33:54.658
<i>What time are you going for?</i>

33:54.783 --> 33:55.951
<i>1:54.</i>

33:56.910 --> 33:58.120
<i>1:54?</i>

33:58.579 --> 34:01.957
<i>I'm training to win, not to chill.</i>

34:18.474 --> 34:21.685
<i>Jeff Roy - Provincial Champion 201 1
Tim Fortin 2nd</i>

34:21.810 --> 34:24.980
<i>Tim Fortin - Provincial Champion 2012
Jeff Roy 2nd</i>

34:42.371 --> 34:43.540
Glad you came.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.042
Come on.

34:47.835 --> 34:48.879
Everyone.

34:49.838 --> 34:51.632
Tim's your new teammate.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.509
You know everyone?

34:53.634 --> 34:54.717
Put your bag down.

34:55.844 --> 34:56.719
Warm up everyone.

34:57.179 --> 34:58.514
Welcome to the team, buddy.

34:58.639 --> 35:00.849
Stop chatting, let's go!

35:01.850 --> 35:03.018
What will you run?

35:05.729 --> 35:07.189
800m, like I used to.

35:08.023 --> 35:09.024
Really?

35:12.653 --> 35:14.863
Took you long to decide!

35:15.697 --> 35:18.033
Hope you run faster than you make decisions.

35:18.534 --> 35:19.201
Come on.

35:25.874 --> 35:28.085
What are your goals for this season?

35:28.877 --> 35:30.212
24.30 for 200m.

35:32.047 --> 35:34.341
Under 19 min for 5000m.

35:36.426 --> 35:38.178
Nationals, 800m.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.516
Nationals, 800m.

35:51.942 --> 35:53.694
24.25 for 200m.

36:03.245 --> 36:04.246
See you tomorrow?

36:22.097 --> 36:23.265
Really going for it...

36:25.392 --> 36:27.394
There's only one spot for the Nationals.

36:28.645 --> 36:29.396
Yeah.

36:34.401 --> 36:35.903
You're dumb or what?

36:38.947 --> 36:41.909
I'll win in 1:54, you can't even break 2 min.

36:44.995 --> 36:46.496
Just saying.

36:48.790 --> 36:51.335
Hard enough with your boyfriend's suicide.

36:52.586 --> 36:54.254
Sorry, he wasn't your boyfriend.

36:56.423 --> 36:57.132
Anyway...

37:04.306 --> 37:05.307
Good luck.

37:17.486 --> 37:18.695
On your mark...

37:59.361 --> 38:00.529
1:57.

38:02.364 --> 38:03.365
2:02.

38:57.127 --> 38:59.755
Looking good, my little Princess!

39:01.590 --> 39:02.591
Thirsty?

39:15.270 --> 39:16.813
Call me Princess one more time!

39:17.939 --> 39:18.940
Tim, stop!

39:19.775 --> 39:21.151
It's just a fucking joke!

39:21.276 --> 39:22.819
Stop! Leave him alone!

39:23.445 --> 39:25.155
Stop it, guys!

39:26.490 --> 39:27.616
Stop that!

39:29.159 --> 39:30.452
Calm down!

39:32.287 --> 39:33.622
Calm down.

39:36.458 --> 39:37.334
Relax!

39:37.459 --> 39:38.293
You too!

39:39.086 --> 39:40.962
You two, in my office, now!

39:42.506 --> 39:43.507
Get in there!

39:50.847 --> 39:52.099
Tim, move it!

40:05.153 --> 40:06.113
Sit down.

40:11.535 --> 40:12.869
You don't have to like each other

40:12.994 --> 40:14.830
but you're on the same team.

40:16.123 --> 40:17.999
I know Tim's meddling in your things,

40:18.125 --> 40:19.209
so just run faster.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.211
You, take a chill pill, I saw you attack Jeff.

40:21.336 --> 40:22.337
I'm talking!

40:24.005 --> 40:25.048
Whatever he said,

40:25.173 --> 40:27.551
I won't tolerate disrespect in my team.

40:27.676 --> 40:28.677
Is that clear?

40:30.470 --> 40:31.638
Is that clear?

40:48.029 --> 40:49.322
Put your hands on me.

40:51.158 --> 40:51.908
What?

40:53.160 --> 40:54.703
Put your hands on me.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.539
Come on! Make out with me.

40:57.664 --> 40:58.748
Isn't that what you want?!

41:03.920 --> 41:05.380
Why'd you kiss me?

41:06.548 --> 41:09.843
You thought you could kiss me without asking?

41:11.052 --> 41:13.430
You're just like those guys even if you're a
fag.

41:17.392 --> 41:18.894
It's not what you think. Stop!

41:19.019 --> 41:20.103
It's not what you think.

41:20.562 --> 41:21.563
Please!

41:22.731 --> 41:24.191
It's not what you think.

41:25.066 --> 41:25.984
Wait.

41:26.109 --> 41:27.110
Just listen.

41:27.235 --> 41:28.904
You think I'm stupid?

41:29.446 --> 41:30.989
I know you kissed me

41:31.114 --> 41:32.949
to prove to everyone you're not gay!

41:34.951 --> 41:36.578
You used me.

41:54.262 --> 41:55.263
Let me go!

42:05.899 --> 42:07.275
You let me down.

42:23.333 --> 42:26.628
5km warm-up today.

42:26.753 --> 42:30.006
Acceleration drills, then sprints.

42:30.131 --> 42:31.675
Finish up with 2 tempo runs

42:31.800 --> 42:33.468
and a nice cool down.

43:26.521 --> 43:29.065
1:57 Tim. 1:58 Jeff.

43:29.691 --> 43:31.860
If you ever do that again...

43:32.694 --> 43:34.321
Don't touch me!

43:35.530 --> 43:36.531
Guys, stop it!

43:44.873 --> 43:46.082
Sorry, Jen...

44:22.077 --> 44:24.371
Your times are starting to get to Jeff.

44:25.372 --> 44:27.374
Be careful, he won't go down without a fight.

44:28.124 --> 44:29.918
No hanky-panky, lovers!

44:30.752 --> 44:32.921
Party at my house tonight. It'll be sick.

44:38.593 --> 44:40.220
Pick me up at 8pm.

44:42.597 --> 44:45.016
You leave me no choice with your kiss.

44:45.141 --> 44:46.643
If we don't look like a couple,

44:46.768 --> 44:48.144
your plan won't work.

44:59.614 --> 45:02.409
Jeff asked me out one time.

45:03.159 --> 45:03.993
What did you say?

45:06.413 --> 45:08.164
Wasn't as lucky as you.

45:12.419 --> 45:13.169
Come on.

45:36.276 --> 45:36.901
How are you?

45:37.026 --> 45:37.694
Good. You?

45:47.829 --> 45:50.248
So glad you made it!

45:50.373 --> 45:51.708
Pretty sick party, huh?

45:51.833 --> 45:53.460
Did you see all the hot girls?

45:54.169 --> 45:56.087
We saw it's your birthday tomorrow!

45:56.212 --> 45:57.672
Let's celebrate. What do you drink?

45:58.214 --> 45:59.215
I don't really drink.

45:59.674 --> 46:01.468
Yeah, right!

46:06.473 --> 46:08.308
Who is it?
- It's Jeff.

46:10.310 --> 46:11.853
Let's get this party started.

46:15.356 --> 46:16.399
Cheers!

46:21.362 --> 46:23.698
Hits hard, right?

46:26.242 --> 46:28.369
Happy you're here. Want a beer?

46:28.495 --> 46:29.537
I'll take one.

46:31.498 --> 46:32.791
We're going downstairs, okay?

46:32.916 --> 46:34.250
Sure!

46:35.543 --> 46:37.796
Don't forget! No latex, no sex!

46:37.921 --> 46:39.172
Shut up!

47:35.770 --> 47:37.939
3, 2, 1!

47:50.243 --> 47:52.453
9 seconds!

47:58.960 --> 48:00.128
I'll do it!

48:06.134 --> 48:08.595
Tim is on fire!

48:10.138 --> 48:11.347
Get ready!

48:14.809 --> 48:17.353
3, 2, 1!

48:23.818 --> 48:25.320
8 seconds!

48:49.010 --> 48:50.386
Check out his face!

50:32.113 --> 50:34.282
I know I fucked up, Francis.

50:37.952 --> 50:39.495
Stop. Not here.

51:59.575 --> 52:00.910
Hello, Timmy.

53:14.942 --> 53:16.527
<i>Great party last night, huh!?</i>

53:16.652 --> 53:18.946
<i>What will I do with this nice video.</i>

53:27.288 --> 53:28.748
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

53:35.755 --> 53:37.465
<i>Jeff is now disconnected.</i>

53:48.142 --> 53:49.644
<i>Delete your account</i>

54:03.658 --> 54:04.825
You coming?

54:05.284 --> 54:07.036
Just changing. Be right there.

54:12.291 --> 54:14.252
<i>Happy birthday Tim</i>

54:14.377 --> 54:16.170
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

54:21.300 --> 54:22.301
Make a wish.

54:27.515 --> 54:28.516
Now your gift.

54:32.728 --> 54:35.356
<i>9 new messages from Jeff</i>

54:37.066 --> 54:37.984
Here.

54:39.402 --> 54:40.569
Birthday messages?

54:40.903 --> 54:41.904
Yeah.

54:46.701 --> 54:48.077
This watch tracks everything.

54:48.202 --> 54:51.747
Splits, laps, pulse...

54:52.373 --> 54:54.208
All you gotta do now is run fast.

54:54.542 --> 54:55.376
Thanks.

54:56.544 --> 54:58.045
I'll get the plates.

57:21.689 --> 57:22.565
What's wrong?

57:24.024 --> 57:25.025
Pulled something.

57:26.235 --> 57:27.111
Sucks!

57:27.236 --> 57:28.737
Are you out for long?

57:29.196 --> 57:30.489
Not sure.

57:31.073 --> 57:33.534
You deactivated your Facebook.

57:33.993 --> 57:35.077
Too bad.

57:36.537 --> 57:38.205
It was a waste of time.

57:53.888 --> 57:56.056
Wake up guys! Hurry up!

57:56.557 --> 57:58.225
I forgot my watch. I'll be back.

57:58.684 --> 58:00.811
Distance running today:

58:00.936 --> 58:03.022
5km warm-up followed by

58:03.147 --> 58:05.274
3 times 200m at 80%,

58:05.399 --> 58:06.400
2 recovery laps,

58:06.525 --> 58:08.736
and an 8-lap tempo run at 90%.

58:10.446 --> 58:11.572
Hurry up!

58:17.119 --> 58:19.121
You have to slowly start running again.

58:19.580 --> 58:21.749
Get ready, I'll adjust your training.

58:22.416 --> 58:24.835
I tried running yesterday, it got worse.

58:24.960 --> 58:27.755
If you don't heal quickly, your season's over.

58:28.255 --> 58:29.715
It's not my fault.

58:32.885 --> 58:34.637
Ice it and see me in 3 days.

58:54.990 --> 58:56.283
Going somewhere?

58:56.408 --> 58:57.284
Screw off.

58:57.409 --> 58:59.411
Healed all of a sudden?

59:01.914 --> 59:02.957
What did I do to you?

59:03.082 --> 59:03.791
What?

59:04.792 --> 59:06.627
You're really asking me that?

59:07.628 --> 59:09.296
You join the team,

59:09.421 --> 59:11.632
try to beat me and steal my spot?

59:11.757 --> 59:12.633
Look at me!

59:13.175 --> 59:14.802
Thought I'd let it go?

59:15.302 --> 59:16.762
Thought I'd let it go?

59:18.806 --> 59:20.140
I was always told

59:20.266 --> 59:21.976
whoever works the hardest wins.

59:22.810 --> 59:25.980
I haven't trained my ass off for 4 years

59:26.105 --> 59:29.191
to have a fucking faggot ruin it all!

59:31.110 --> 59:33.445
Lay low until the season ends

59:35.030 --> 59:36.699
or the entire school finds out

59:36.824 --> 59:38.659
you suck big motherfucking cocks.

59:40.661 --> 59:42.830
We all know how it went down for your ex.

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:13.902
You're home early.

01:00:14.028 --> 01:00:15.362
Practice was cancelled.

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:17.906
Too cold for you guys?

01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:19.241
Weaklings!

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:20.743
Why would you say that?

01:00:20.868 --> 01:00:22.244
Just kidding.

01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:24.705
You'll be ready for the track meet?

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:25.914
I'll be ready.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.124
You'll make a good time?

01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:29.001
Stop the interrogation!

01:00:37.718 --> 01:00:40.387
You're not allowed in my room!

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:42.598
No locked doors in this house!

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:44.767
Your mom and I always made that clear.

01:00:44.892 --> 01:00:46.268
Mom isn't here anymore!

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:48.520
Come out!

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:01.950
Dinner's almost ready.

01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:03.160
I have to study.

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.036
That can wait.

01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:05.162
That's enough!

01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:06.080
Don't touch me!

01:01:06.205 --> 01:01:08.540
I'm not your obedient little bitch.

01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:31.563
Come in.

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:37.778
Hey, you're better!

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.988
I'm quitting the team.

01:01:40.114 --> 01:01:40.989
Why?

01:01:41.115 --> 01:01:41.949
Not interested anymore.

01:01:42.074 --> 01:01:43.075
I don't buy it.

01:01:43.575 --> 01:01:44.660
I don't care.

01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:46.453
Hey, hold on! What's the matter?

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:48.664
If I say I'm not interested, it's 'cause I'm
not.

01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:50.332
So leave me the fuck alone!

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:04.596
Wait for me. Just going to the bathroom.

01:03:03.864 --> 01:03:05.532
Why won't you come back on the team?

01:03:08.202 --> 01:03:10.746
You Sullivan's messenger now?

01:03:10.871 --> 01:03:12.664
No one understands what happened.

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:15.876
You just went off the grid.

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:19.880
Why are you avoiding me?

01:03:24.218 --> 01:03:25.385
Come back.

01:03:27.054 --> 01:03:28.013
I can't.

01:03:31.225 --> 01:03:32.017
Why not?

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.068
I'm screwed.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:45.906
Someone's found out about me.

01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:50.452
And?

01:03:51.078 --> 01:03:52.246
Is he threatening you?

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:56.250
What kind of threats?

01:03:58.919 --> 01:03:59.795
Who is it?

01:04:01.255 --> 01:04:02.464
Tim! Who is it?

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:06.635
It's Jeff, right?

01:04:07.261 --> 01:04:08.095
Don't.

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.472
If you can't, I'll deal with him!

01:04:12.266 --> 01:04:13.475
Don't...

01:04:15.477 --> 01:04:17.479
or everyone will find out.

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:51.179
What are you doing here?

01:04:51.597 --> 01:04:52.806
Came to talk.

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.224
Can't we do it at school?

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:55.684
Is your father home?

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.148
Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:05:02.149 --> 01:05:03.609
Can we talk?

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:05.152
Of course.

01:05:07.988 --> 01:05:09.489
<i>You quit the team,</i>

01:05:09.615 --> 01:05:10.991
<i>you bullshit your coach</i>

01:05:11.783 --> 01:05:13.994
<i>and you lie to me?</i>

01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:20.959
I don't know what to do anymore.

01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:25.172
It's been like this for 5 years.

01:05:28.008 --> 01:05:29.509
How can I get through to you?

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:33.305
What's going on?

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:39.811
Listen...

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:42.397
You have a week left to think about it.

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:45.651
After that, it'll be too late for the
Nationals.

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:49.196
I know you can do it.

01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:53.367
Now, it's up to you.

01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:04.169
Keep me posted.

01:06:09.174 --> 01:06:10.217
How are you?

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.094
What's up!

01:06:16.056 --> 01:06:16.974
Happy to see you!

01:06:17.099 --> 01:06:18.433
Us too, man!

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:20.435
Glad you came.

01:06:20.936 --> 01:06:22.437
Time to run!

01:06:26.358 --> 01:06:27.901
Scared to lose?

01:06:43.709 --> 01:06:44.835
You're good!

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.336
I couldn't catch up.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:47.671
How many seconds apart?

01:06:47.796 --> 01:06:49.381
3 seconds.
- At least.

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:52.300
Congrats.

01:06:52.426 --> 01:06:54.136
Despite Jen's lead.

01:06:54.261 --> 01:06:57.139
I know! I gave you a head start!

01:06:57.264 --> 01:06:59.933
I'd love to see you two race.

01:07:00.726 --> 01:07:01.977
I gave you such a lead!

01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:04.604
I just couldn't use it!

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:28.747
On your mark...

01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:50.060
I won't pry, but you need to do as I say.

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:53.064
We have a month to get you ready.

01:09:54.316 --> 01:09:57.319
We'll focus on only one thing: your guts.

01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:00.071
We'll push your limits.

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:03.617
When you've gone all out, run even faster.

01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:04.993
You're at 1:56.

01:10:05.118 --> 01:10:07.996
You need 1:54 for the Nationals.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.498
Those 2 seconds are crucial.

01:10:10.624 --> 01:10:13.627
They'll be the hardest 2 seconds of your life.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.128
Are you ready for that?

01:10:16.463 --> 01:10:17.339
Go.

01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:29.601
You're hurting?

01:10:31.186 --> 01:10:33.480
I don't believe you. Again!

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:36.233
Go, go, go!

01:10:36.358 --> 01:10:37.442
On your mark...

01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:40.737
No time to rest.

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:42.280
On your mark...

01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:49.788
1:56.70. Recovery lap, then one more.

01:10:52.374 --> 01:10:53.875
Going for a little run.

01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:09.683
Ready?

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:13.311
You've got company today.

01:11:14.896 --> 01:11:15.605
Hi!

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:16.690
Hi, Jen.

01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:19.234
One lap at top speed.

01:11:19.359 --> 01:11:20.026
Go for it.

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:41.047
Catch up to her.

01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:45.719
On your mark...

01:11:47.387 --> 01:11:48.763
get set...

01:11:58.606 --> 01:11:59.566
You coming?

01:12:08.116 --> 01:12:09.117
Push!

01:12:27.427 --> 01:12:28.762
Good job!

01:12:30.764 --> 01:12:32.390
Let's go, recovery lap.

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:35.977
You're champs!

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:43.109
<i>Goal 800m 1:54</i>

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:10.804
At your age, I would've beaten you...

01:13:10.929 --> 01:13:11.805
hands down!

01:13:12.639 --> 01:13:14.015
I'm proud of you, son.

01:13:18.478 --> 01:13:21.147
I know it's been rough since your mom passed.

01:13:22.649 --> 01:13:24.025
I'm so proud of you.

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:25.318
Come on! Hungry?

01:13:33.493 --> 01:13:35.078
<i>Welcome to the Provincial Championships</i>

01:13:35.203 --> 01:13:37.205
<i>at the Richard Garneau stadium.</i>

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:39.499
<i>Many different events today:</i>

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:42.877
<i>the hammer throw,
featuring the defending champion,</i>

01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:45.713
<i>the high jump, the discus throw</i>

01:13:45.839 --> 01:13:48.007
<i>and many running events...</i>

01:14:03.398 --> 01:14:05.817
<i>And they're off!</i>

01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:17.370
Is Jeff here?

01:14:17.704 --> 01:14:19.164
He's warming up.

01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:21.708
He won't do anything.

01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:24.127
You're gonna run,

01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:25.712
beat him

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:27.547
and move on to the Nationals.

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:30.550
Trust me.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.177
He won't do anything.

01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:44.063
Back from the dead!

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:46.274
What are you doing here? Competing?

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:47.609
Nice, man!

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:51.613
You knew?

01:14:51.738 --> 01:14:52.906
Yeah.

01:14:53.907 --> 01:14:55.533
You really doing this?

01:14:56.201 --> 01:14:57.076
Are you racing?

01:14:59.621 --> 01:15:00.580
You ready?

01:15:01.122 --> 01:15:02.207
Welcome!

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:04.250
Drop your bag.

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:08.755
Light jog to warm up.

01:15:10.924 --> 01:15:12.800
Great day coming up. Have fun!

01:15:24.771 --> 01:15:27.941
<i>The qualification races are about to start.</i>

01:15:28.066 --> 01:15:29.275
<i>In the Juvenile category,</i>

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.487
<i>the highly anticipated boys 800m.</i>

01:15:32.612 --> 01:15:34.113
<i>The wind is blowing strong.</i>

01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:36.783
<i>We should expect excellent results.</i>

01:15:37.242 --> 01:15:38.451
Are you ready?

01:15:39.619 --> 01:15:41.538
There are 8 qualifying heats.

01:15:41.663 --> 01:15:43.790
Each heat's winner goes on to the final.

01:15:43.915 --> 01:15:45.959
Go hard, but don't go all out.

01:15:46.084 --> 01:15:47.961
1:56, 1:57.

01:15:50.338 --> 01:15:51.089
You can do it.

01:15:52.507 --> 01:15:53.341
You okay?

01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:55.260
You've got this.

01:15:55.927 --> 01:15:56.928
Good luck.

01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:04.561
<i>1st 800m qualification heat.</i>

01:16:04.686 --> 01:16:07.981
<i>Now getting ready, Joël Rousseau...</i>

01:16:09.649 --> 01:16:11.734
<i>Dominic Raymond who finished</i>

01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:15.196
<i>with an excellent 1:57 this season...</i>

01:16:17.699 --> 01:16:19.576
<i>Tim Fortin is returning to the competition.</i>

01:16:19.701 --> 01:16:21.828
<i>He was the Provincial Champion at 12.</i>

01:16:21.953 --> 01:16:24.122
<i>It's his first race of the season...</i>

01:16:42.682 --> 01:16:44.601
<i>It's a great start!</i>

01:16:44.726 --> 01:16:49.564
<i>800m Juvenile, 2 laps.</i>

01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:03.536
Shit, he's boxed in.

01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:08.207
Come on Tim! Don't stop!

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:10.585
You can do it!

01:17:15.673 --> 01:17:17.342
Get out of there, Tim!

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:23.640
<i>Tim Fortin gets out of the pack</i>

01:17:23.765 --> 01:17:26.392
<i>now in 3rd position.</i>

01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:37.153
59. His pace is too slow.

01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:38.488
Faster!

01:17:38.613 --> 01:17:40.239
Go, Tim!

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:52.585
Harder!

01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:55.213
1:26.

01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:56.798
He shifted into overdrive!

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:07.600
Go, go, go!

01:18:12.105 --> 01:18:13.940
<i>Last meters of the race.</i>

01:18:14.065 --> 01:18:15.441
<i>At the finish line, it's...</i>

<i>Tim Fortin for the win!</i>

01:18:31.833 --> 01:18:34.085
Crazy finishing kick!

01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:38.089
Got juice left for finals?

01:18:38.464 --> 01:18:40.341
Recovery jog

01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:42.009
and then get some rest.

01:18:49.684 --> 01:18:51.227
<i>8th heat, 800m.</i>

01:18:53.646 --> 01:18:56.190
<i>Jeff Roy is in the lead,</i>

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:58.526
<i>running at an excellent pace...</i>

01:19:15.126 --> 01:19:18.045
<i>800m final, Juvenile...</i>

01:19:20.506 --> 01:19:22.300
<i>Look out for...</i>

01:19:37.398 --> 01:19:40.318
<i>Who will win this eagerly awaited final?</i>

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:45.698
It's now or never.

01:20:06.928 --> 01:20:08.387
On your mark...

01:20:19.524 --> 01:20:20.566
<i>It's a good start!</i>

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:25.696
<i>Tim Fortin and Jeff Roy in the lead...</i>

01:20:38.918 --> 01:20:39.752
Good!

01:20:40.211 --> 01:20:41.963
Great!

01:20:48.261 --> 01:20:49.804
28 seconds! Perfect!

01:20:51.264 --> 01:20:52.598
Look at Pat over there.

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:20.084
<i>One lap to go!</i>

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:22.795
56 seconds! He's on fire!

01:21:23.337 --> 01:21:24.755
Jeff won't keep up.

01:21:49.864 --> 01:21:51.324

01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:12.053

<i>Last meters of the race.</i>

01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:21.646
<i>At the finish line...</i>

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:24.982
<i>Great win for Jeff Roy!</i>

01:22:35.368 --> 01:22:36.535
Good job, Tim.

What's going on, you're gay?

01:23:35.386 --> 01:23:37.763
We see you getting blown by a dude.

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:40.433
Knew you were a little princess!

01:23:40.558 --> 01:23:41.475
Tim, wait.

01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:40.618
Hey, buddy...

01:25:04.725 --> 01:25:05.893

Look at me.

01:25:31.544 --> 01:25:33.045
I love you.

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:36.090
I'll always love you more.

01:25:37.216 --> 01:25:38.384
Never less.

Never less.

<i>Next season, all records are yours.</i>

01:26:41.488 --> 01:26:42.823

<i>Hello, Timmy!</i>

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:26.093
<i>He crashed his car.</i>

01:28:26.218 --> 01:28:28.804

<i>I love cocks!</i>

01:29:24.443 --> 01:29:25.444
Enough!

01:31:04.168 --> 01:31:06.920
There must've been a mistake.

01:31:10.174 --> 01:31:11.550
Did you arrest Jeff?

01:31:13.552 --> 01:31:16.013
What?! This is absurd!

01:31:17.556 --> 01:31:20.184
2634 people saw my son getting a...

01:31:20.559 --> 01:31:22.019
There's nothing we can do?!

01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:20.953
I'll be home late.

01:32:22.079 --> 01:32:24.873
Your coach and I are meeting the school board

01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:27.251
so you can finish the year at home.

01:32:33.507 --> 01:32:35.926
Don't know how, but we'll make it through.

01:32:39.346 --> 01:32:40.347
We're a team.

01:32:41.139 --> 01:32:42.766
We've got each other's back.

01:33:00.784 --> 01:33:02.035
It'll be okay, son.

01:33:04.955 --> 01:33:05.831
See you later.

01:33:44.077 --> 01:33:44.870
I'm home!

01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:47.706
Good news!

01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:50.542

<i>Sorry about everything. I love you.</i>

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:24.910
Is Tim home?

01:34:25.035 --> 01:34:26.244
No. What's going on?

01:34:26.370 --> 01:34:27.621
Where's his computer?

01:34:27.746 --> 01:34:28.580
Come in.

01:34:32.918 --> 01:34:33.752
Here.

01:34:41.051 --> 01:34:42.427
He just posted this.

01:34:47.265 --> 01:34:48.767
<i>What did I do to all of you?</i>

01:34:54.106 --> 01:34:56.441
<i>You've been on my case for 5 years.</i>

01:35:01.113 --> 01:35:03.240
<i>You come at me from all sides...</i>

01:35:03.907 --> 01:35:05.117
<i>at school...</i>

01:35:05.951 --> 01:35:07.285

01:35:10.997 --> 01:35:13.125
<i>And I don't even know why.</i>

01:35:15.127 --> 01:35:17.337
<i>You even kick me when I'm down.</i>

01:35:19.089 --> 01:35:20.590
<i>I can't bear this anymore.</i>

01:35:24.302 --> 01:35:25.512
<i>This has to stop.</i>

01:35:28.098 --> 01:35:29.474
<i>It'll stop right now.</i>

01:35:33.603 --> 01:35:34.479
That's it?

01:35:45.657 --> 01:35:46.533
He's not answering.

01:35:47.325 --> 01:35:49.202
I'll run by the park where he used to go.

01:35:49.327 --> 01:35:51.538
There's a party for Jeff, I'll check it out.

01:36:15.479 --> 01:36:16.104
<i>Hello?</i>

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:18.064
He's not here. You?

01:36:18.190 --> 01:36:21.193
<i>I'm almost there.</i>

01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:25.906
I'll go back home, in case I missed something.

01:38:11.803 --> 01:38:12.512
I'm sorry for...

01:38:15.307 --> 01:38:17.475
You won't bother anyone ever again.

01:39:32.050 --> 01:39:34.594
<i>Potassium nitrate</i>

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:56.282
What are you doing here?

01:39:57.242 --> 01:39:58.618
Pat and Syd are looking for you.

01:40:01.037 --> 01:40:02.414
I screwed up. There's a bomb.

01:40:02.914 --> 01:40:04.165
Get out! There's a bomb!

01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:05.959
Everybody out! There's a bomb!

01:41:49.354 --> 01:41:50.355
I wasn't able to...

01:41:52.857 --> 01:41:54.692
I wasn't able to protect him.

01:42:00.907 --> 01:42:02.242
I wasn't there...

01:42:05.995 --> 01:42:08.581
His intentions weren't necessarily good...

01:42:11.042 --> 01:42:12.752
but when he realized...

01:42:14.379 --> 01:42:17.924
the harm he would cause, he chose...

01:42:18.925 --> 01:42:20.760
to save us all.

01:42:23.596 --> 01:42:25.598
He was a really good guy.

01:42:29.185 --> 01:42:30.937
It was only a joke.

01:42:40.113 --> 01:42:41.781
Just a joke.
