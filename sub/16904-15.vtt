WEBVTT

00:03.963 --> 00:05.794
Listen up, everyone.

00:05.914 --> 00:07.518
I have an announcement to make.

00:07.638 --> 00:09.074
As you may have heard,

00:09.194 --> 00:11.245
Carol and I broke up last week.

00:11.313 --> 00:13.780
Hang on.
Why do you have a cat?

00:13.847 --> 00:14.847
And a fanny pack?

00:14.915 --> 00:16.149
And your ponytail,

00:16.216 --> 00:18.016
it's being held up
by a chip clip.

00:18.084 --> 00:19.318
Because I'm giving up, Jenna.

00:19.385 --> 00:20.652
I did the math.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.688
How many times does
a woman meet Mr. Right?

00:22.755 --> 00:24.188
I've had three chances...

00:24.256 --> 00:25.539
Floyd, then Carol,

00:25.624 --> 00:27.692
and I was once in an elevator
with Tom Brokaw,

00:27.759 --> 00:29.260
and I blew all three...

00:29.328 --> 00:30.493
Opportunities!

00:30.544 --> 00:32.679
So I am making
my graceful transition

00:32.762 --> 00:33.763
into spinsterhood.

00:33.831 --> 00:35.698
I have adopted this cat,

00:35.765 --> 00:37.599
named her Emily Dickinson...

00:37.667 --> 00:38.600
Oh, come on!

00:38.668 --> 00:41.069
Named her Emily Dickinson.

00:41.136 --> 00:43.738
Lemon, a word.

00:43.806 --> 00:45.390
Hang on.

00:45.474 --> 00:47.524
Recent breakup, fanny pack, cat?

00:47.608 --> 00:50.177
<i>Quick. Who is
the lead character on NCIS?</i>

00:50.244 --> 00:51.378
Special agent Jethro Gibbs.

00:51.446 --> 00:53.179
In your office, now.

00:53.246 --> 00:54.947
What's the point, Jack?
I'm done.

00:55.015 --> 00:56.749
I took the money I was
saving for my honeymoon,

00:56.817 --> 00:58.117
and I bought a cemetery plot.

00:58.185 --> 00:59.217
I also joined a book club

00:59.285 --> 01:01.152
at the senior center
near my home.

01:01.220 --> 01:03.621
<i>We're reading
Murder on the Orient Express.</i>

01:03.689 --> 01:05.089
You know there's a movie
of that, right?

01:05.156 --> 01:06.373
I did not.

01:06.458 --> 01:09.192
I want to help you, Lemon,

01:09.244 --> 01:10.426
but this is not the week.

01:10.494 --> 01:11.694
Avery's maternity leave
was cut short,

01:11.762 --> 01:13.162
so she could go cover
the collapse

01:13.213 --> 01:14.580
of Greece's banking system.

01:14.665 --> 01:16.531
Since inventing democracy,

01:16.599 --> 01:18.800
those guys have been coasting.

01:18.868 --> 01:20.702
So you're all alone
with baby Liz?

01:20.753 --> 01:22.837
We're calling her Liddy,
after Liddy Dole,

01:22.888 --> 01:24.005
G. Gordon Liddy,

01:24.072 --> 01:25.873
and my martial arts
instructor Li Di.

01:25.941 --> 01:28.641
In addition, I have
a huge presentation coming up.

01:28.709 --> 01:30.477
<i>Meeting magazine
is already calling it</i>

01:30.544 --> 01:32.112
"the first great meeting
of the decade."

01:32.179 --> 01:33.579
I have to be at my best.

01:33.646 --> 01:35.748
I'm negotiating NBC's
licensing fees with Kabletown.

01:35.815 --> 01:37.983
But aren't NBC and Kabletown
the same company now?

01:38.051 --> 01:40.051
That seems like a pretty
big conflict of interest.

01:40.119 --> 01:41.986
Why would the government
even allow that merger?

01:42.054 --> 01:43.321
It's okay. Don't worry.

01:43.388 --> 01:45.255
<i>You just keep watching
Bridalplasty.</i>

01:45.323 --> 01:47.074
Alysinna died last week.

01:50.161 --> 01:51.577
Oh, damn it, I didn't leave

01:51.661 --> 01:53.462
my baby nurse her check
this morning.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.131
I have to go back home
and pay her.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.765
- Right now?
- It's complicated.

01:56.832 --> 01:58.900
These women run your household,

01:58.968 --> 02:00.251
so you have to keep them happy,

02:00.336 --> 02:01.669
which means not saying anything

02:01.737 --> 02:04.238
as your DVR fills up
with Trinidadian soap operas.

02:04.305 --> 02:06.256
But as soon as
I'm out of the woods, Lemon,

02:06.341 --> 02:09.675
I'll take care
of this latest dysfunction.

02:09.743 --> 02:11.210
There's nothing
to take care of, Jack.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.578
Watch this.

02:12.629 --> 02:14.346
I can fit Emily Dickinson's
whole head in my mouth.

02:14.413 --> 02:15.614
No.

Oh, hey, Pete, what's up?

02:35.231 --> 02:36.697
Well, nobody told
the musical guest

02:36.765 --> 02:37.815
that Tracy's in Africa,

02:37.900 --> 02:39.167
so all their instruments
got delivered

02:39.234 --> 02:40.434
even though there's no show.

02:40.486 --> 02:42.936
Rock stars, man.

02:42.987 --> 02:44.604
People screaming your name,

02:44.672 --> 02:47.207
hot women throwing
themselves at you.

02:47.275 --> 02:48.507
Living on a bus.

02:48.575 --> 02:49.542
Ha.

02:49.609 --> 02:52.945
I had all that once...

02:52.996 --> 02:55.013
For three months
back in the early '80s.

02:55.081 --> 02:57.882
Really?
What band were you in?

02:57.950 --> 03:01.802
♪ Everybody's workin'
for the weekend ♪

03:01.886 --> 03:04.822
♪
♪

03:04.889 --> 03:05.822
What?

03:05.889 --> 03:07.290
Yep.
I was in Loverboy.

03:07.357 --> 03:08.291
But then I had to choose

03:08.358 --> 03:09.459
between staying in the band

03:09.526 --> 03:10.927
or taking
that college scholarship

03:10.978 --> 03:12.327
to study TV budgeting.

03:12.395 --> 03:14.513
- Mmm.
- I made my choice.

03:14.597 --> 03:16.665
That part of my life is over.

03:16.732 --> 03:18.699
Hey, it's never too late.

03:18.767 --> 03:21.368
What did you just say?

03:21.436 --> 03:24.187
♪ It's never too late ♪

03:24.271 --> 03:28.274

We need to start a band.

03:44.655 --> 03:46.222
I think we just did.

03:46.289 --> 03:49.658
I'm sorry you had
to wait for this, Sherry.

03:49.726 --> 03:51.327
I hope there was
enough shark meat

03:51.394 --> 03:53.228
in the refrigerator
for one of your sandwiches.

03:54.663 --> 03:57.132
Hold on, this is the same amount

03:57.199 --> 03:59.099
I was paying you
when you worked full time,

03:59.167 --> 04:01.001
and now you're
just working nights.

04:01.069 --> 04:02.569
It's my hourly rate.

04:02.637 --> 04:04.837
You understand my confusion.

04:04.905 --> 04:06.906
I'm actually paying you
more money

04:06.974 --> 04:08.341
to be here half the time.

04:09.809 --> 04:12.894
I'm not saying that
what you do isn't important.

04:12.979 --> 04:14.346
Avery and I appreciate you,

04:14.413 --> 04:16.180
and Liddy just adores you.

04:16.248 --> 04:18.182
But let's just say
you're at the market,

04:18.250 --> 04:19.983
buying potatoes.

04:20.051 --> 04:23.219
And that ten-pound bag
of potatoes costs...

04:23.287 --> 04:24.587
$400.

04:24.655 --> 04:28.023
But then
the, uh, grocery concierge

04:28.091 --> 04:30.425
tells you that
a five-pound bag of potatoes

04:30.493 --> 04:31.493
costs $400.

04:31.561 --> 04:32.960
Well, that would
be shocking, right?

04:33.028 --> 04:36.964
Because a five-pound bag
should only cost $200.

04:37.032 --> 04:39.799
What I'm saying is that
we value what you do,

04:39.867 --> 04:43.836
but this rate is, uh,
unreasonable.

04:47.574 --> 04:49.974
So, what you wan' do?

04:50.042 --> 04:55.812
I want to resolve
this fairly and amicably.

04:55.880 --> 05:02.185
And I don't want
any bad blood, so...

05:02.252 --> 05:03.853
It was nice negotiating with you,

05:03.904 --> 05:05.922
and, uh, here is
all of your money.

05:14.414 --> 05:17.584
An impulsive murderer

05:17.704 --> 05:20.736
has been murdered.

05:20.787 --> 05:23.954
But in which of the two ways

05:24.038 --> 05:25.437
that I have suggested?

05:25.505 --> 05:28.121
In the simpler way by the mafioso

05:28.205 --> 05:30.455
disguised
as a wagon-lit conductor?

05:32.873 --> 05:35.572
Or in the more complex way...

05:35.623 --> 05:36.756
Liz, enough!

05:36.840 --> 05:38.239
I am not gonna just sit
and watch you

05:38.306 --> 05:39.422
plummet into spinsterhood.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.606
Why are you talking so fast?

05:40.673 --> 05:41.589
Because I'm upset!

05:41.673 --> 05:42.939
Also I've been taking

05:43.007 --> 05:44.507
these new Czechoslovakian
organ-slimming pills.

05:44.574 --> 05:45.840
They contain
a little bit of meth,

05:45.908 --> 05:47.423
which is something
my body needs anyway.

05:47.508 --> 05:49.541
Listen, I'm not gonna
let you wallow like this.

05:49.609 --> 05:52.641
I am taking you out
so you can rebound...Sexually.

05:52.709 --> 05:53.841
What? No.

05:53.909 --> 05:54.958
Now, when I'm rebounding,

05:55.042 --> 05:56.609
I like to do it
with an NBA player,

05:56.675 --> 05:59.275
because it's fun wordplay
and they're mean.

05:59.343 --> 06:01.759
Well, thank you
for that disgusting offer,

06:01.827 --> 06:03.209
but I will be in editing
all night,

06:03.277 --> 06:04.760
putting together
"The Best of Tracy Jordan"

06:04.843 --> 06:06.075
to replace this week's show,

06:06.127 --> 06:07.593
so can't go out.
Too bad.

06:07.677 --> 06:08.676
Well, I'm not giving up.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.043
I didn't give up
when Eric Roberts

06:10.111 --> 06:12.411
abandoned me in the desert,
and I won't now.

06:12.478 --> 06:13.511
No judgment, Liz.

06:13.578 --> 06:16.178
Mr. Roberts
thought I was dead.

06:16.246 --> 06:17.462
Oh.

06:17.546 --> 06:20.512
♪ It's never too late for now ♪

06:20.579 --> 06:21.795
Two, three...

06:21.880 --> 06:23.129
♪ It's never too late... ♪

06:23.213 --> 06:24.578
- There you are.
- Great.

06:24.629 --> 06:26.279
You just ruined
a really boss take.

06:26.347 --> 06:27.546
We're recording a song called

06:27.597 --> 06:29.013
<i>It's Never Too Late For Now.</i>

06:29.080 --> 06:32.113
It's about that delicious
little mystery I call life.

06:32.181 --> 06:33.714
Oh, my God, that sucks.

06:33.782 --> 06:34.914
Come on.
We gotta go to editing.

06:34.982 --> 06:36.280
No, I'm not going to editing.

06:36.348 --> 06:39.348
I'm in here shredding
away like a righteous ax master,

06:39.415 --> 06:40.848
and my arthritis is acting up.

06:40.915 --> 06:42.014
Do you have any ibuprofen?

06:42.082 --> 06:44.315
Uh, my fanny pack is in my office

06:44.382 --> 06:46.182
in my mini-fridge.

06:46.250 --> 06:47.965
I like my tampons to be cold.

06:48.049 --> 06:50.016
I'll be downstairs.

06:50.083 --> 06:51.933
Wait. "Hornberger-Rossitano"?

06:52.017 --> 06:53.783
Why is your name first?

06:53.850 --> 06:54.800
It's alphabetical.
So what?

06:54.884 --> 06:56.049
So I'm the one who said,

06:56.101 --> 06:57.316
"it's never too late."

06:57.384 --> 06:58.517
I invented that.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.084
When we get up
at the Grammys, I talk!

07:00.152 --> 07:01.117
Not you!

07:03.051 --> 07:04.102
Welcome to Brokeblack Mountain.

07:05.186 --> 07:06.551
You need to go black, Marty!

07:06.619 --> 07:08.752
This is Loz... Liz.
This is Liz.

07:08.802 --> 07:10.752
Lemon, I am supposed
to represent NBC

07:10.820 --> 07:12.952
in a negotiation that Rex Belcher

07:13.020 --> 07:15.586
<i>the American Journal
of meetings rated four chairs.</i>

07:15.654 --> 07:16.936
Four.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.453
I'm sorry. Is that
another magazine about meetings?

07:17.020 --> 07:19.453
I'm sorry. Is that
another magazine about meetings?

07:19.521 --> 07:21.053
Meanwhile, I just got worked over

07:19.521 --> 07:21.053
Meanwhile, I just got worked over

07:21.121 --> 07:22.987
by my Trinidadian night nurse.

07:21.121 --> 07:22.987
by my Trinidadian night nurse.

07:23.054 --> 07:25.287
I made every mistake you can
in a negotiation.

07:23.054 --> 07:25.287
I made every mistake you can
in a negotiation.

07:25.355 --> 07:27.221
I spoke first, I smiled,

07:25.355 --> 07:27.221
I spoke first, I smiled,

07:27.289 --> 07:29.021
I negotiated with myself.

07:27.289 --> 07:29.021
I negotiated with myself.

07:29.089 --> 07:30.805
If I had done that during
a mock negotiation

07:29.089 --> 07:30.805
If I had done that during
a mock negotiation

07:30.889 --> 07:32.221
in business school,

07:30.889 --> 07:32.221
in business school,

07:32.289 --> 07:33.805
professor Widmer
would have spanked me

07:32.289 --> 07:33.805
professor Widmer
would have spanked me

07:33.890 --> 07:36.439
in front of the whole class,
bare bottom.

07:33.890 --> 07:36.439
in front of the whole class,
bare bottom.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.689
Okay, but it's harder with
someone like a nanny, right?

07:36.524 --> 07:38.689
Okay, but it's harder with
someone like a nanny, right?

07:38.757 --> 07:40.489
There's an emotional component.

07:38.757 --> 07:40.489
There's an emotional component.

07:40.557 --> 07:41.856
She takes care of your baby.

07:40.557 --> 07:41.856
She takes care of your baby.

07:41.924 --> 07:44.823
Lemon, you just had
a structural, analytic insight.

07:41.924 --> 07:44.823
Lemon, you just had
a structural, analytic insight.

07:44.891 --> 07:46.690
Professor Widmer
would have given you

07:44.891 --> 07:46.690
Professor Widmer
would have given you

07:46.758 --> 07:47.924
a "good job" spanking.

07:46.758 --> 07:47.924
a "good job" spanking.

07:47.975 --> 07:49.590
What is business school?

07:47.975 --> 07:49.590
What is business school?

07:49.658 --> 07:51.425
The reason Sherry
can manipulate me

07:49.658 --> 07:51.425
The reason Sherry
can manipulate me

07:51.492 --> 07:53.525
is because she has leverage.

07:51.492 --> 07:53.525
is because she has leverage.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.759
What pushed me out of the club

18:10.623 --> 18:12.759
What pushed me out of the club

18:12.826 --> 18:15.364
when I was wavering
about leaving with Anders?

18:12.826 --> 18:15.364
when I was wavering
about leaving with Anders?

18:15.431 --> 18:18.370
Yeah, I came here with my friend,

18:15.431 --> 18:18.370
Yeah, I came here with my friend,

18:18.436 --> 18:20.440
so I'm just gonna stay here.

18:18.436 --> 18:20.440
so I'm just gonna stay here.

18:22.444 --> 18:25.364
Aah!

18:22.444 --> 18:25.364
Aah!

18:25.449 --> 18:28.120
Yah!

18:25.449 --> 18:28.120
Yah!

18:29.655 --> 18:31.825
Get off of me!
My eye!

18:29.655 --> 18:31.825
Get off of me!
My eye!

18:43.446 --> 18:44.731
What, this?

18:43.446 --> 18:44.731
What, this?

18:44.816 --> 18:47.319
I got hit by a bird
on a roller coaster.

18:44.816 --> 18:47.319
I got hit by a bird
on a roller coaster.

18:47.387 --> 18:50.826
Even the club was strange.

18:47.387 --> 18:50.826
Even the club was strange.

18:50.892 --> 18:53.663
Almost as if it had been
designed specifically for me,

18:50.892 --> 18:53.663
Almost as if it had been
designed specifically for me,

18:53.731 --> 18:56.001
but who has the resources
and the connections

18:53.731 --> 18:56.001
but who has the resources
and the connections

18:56.069 --> 18:59.808
to create a Liz Lemon-themed
club in one day?

18:56.069 --> 18:59.808
to create a Liz Lemon-themed
club in one day?

19:07.589 --> 19:09.925
You had to sign
your crime, didn't you?

19:07.589 --> 19:09.925
You had to sign
your crime, didn't you?

19:09.977 --> 19:12.529
<i>You're the one who gave me
those moDVDs.</i>

19:09.977 --> 19:12.529
<i>You're the one who gave me
those moDVDs.</i>

19:12.597 --> 19:14.266
And what was the final straw?

19:12.597 --> 19:14.266
And what was the final straw?

19:14.334 --> 19:16.203
It was Anders saying,

19:14.334 --> 19:16.203
It was Anders saying,

19:16.270 --> 19:18.991
"it's never too late for now,"

19:16.270 --> 19:18.991
"it's never too late for now,"

19:19.075 --> 19:22.279
a coincidence that I took
as a sign from the universe.

19:19.075 --> 19:22.279
a coincidence that I took
as a sign from the universe.

19:22.347 --> 19:24.617
Also, it's just a great song...

19:22.347 --> 19:24.617
Also, it's just a great song...

19:24.685 --> 19:26.453
that Pete wrote.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.453
that Pete wrote.

19:26.521 --> 19:28.558
Thanks, man.

19:26.521 --> 19:28.558
Thanks, man.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.727
Sound mound rocks the town.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.727
Sound mound rocks the town.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.231
Shut up, both of you.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.231
Shut up, both of you.

19:32.299 --> 19:35.369
So how did Anders
even know that phrase?

19:32.299 --> 19:35.369
So how did Anders
even know that phrase?

19:35.437 --> 19:39.142
How did Anders seem to know
everything about me?

19:35.437 --> 19:39.142
How did Anders seem to know
everything about me?

19:39.194 --> 19:43.016
It's white wine,
ice cubes, and sprite.

19:39.194 --> 19:43.016
It's white wine,
ice cubes, and sprite.

19:43.084 --> 19:44.418
She calls it...

19:43.084 --> 19:44.418
She calls it...

19:44.486 --> 19:46.004
Funky juice.

19:44.486 --> 19:46.004
Funky juice.

19:46.090 --> 19:48.259
I don't know
if I want to do this.

19:46.090 --> 19:48.259
I don't know
if I want to do this.

19:48.326 --> 19:50.696
There's only one question
I can't answer.

19:48.326 --> 19:50.696
There's only one question
I can't answer.

19:50.764 --> 19:53.000
Who was Anders?

19:50.764 --> 19:53.000
Who was Anders?

19:53.052 --> 19:55.404
An old Harvard chum of Toofer's?

19:53.052 --> 19:55.404
An old Harvard chum of Toofer's?

19:55.472 --> 19:57.692
The son of one
of Jack's senator friends?

19:55.472 --> 19:57.692
The son of one
of Jack's senator friends?

19:57.776 --> 19:59.878
He certainly wasn't
a Swiss prostitute

19:57.776 --> 19:59.878
He certainly wasn't
a Swiss prostitute

19:59.946 --> 20:01.865
that Martha Stewart
recommended to me.

19:59.946 --> 20:01.865
that Martha Stewart
recommended to me.

20:04.187 --> 20:07.860
And that is
the complex explanation.

20:04.187 --> 20:07.860
And that is
the complex explanation.

20:07.928 --> 20:11.866
Of course, such a conspiracy
would require a group of people

20:07.928 --> 20:11.866
Of course, such a conspiracy
would require a group of people

20:11.918 --> 20:16.841
who knew me so well and cared
about my happiness so much

20:11.918 --> 20:16.841
who knew me so well and cared
about my happiness so much

20:16.909 --> 20:19.948
that it's impossible to believe.

20:16.909 --> 20:19.948
that it's impossible to believe.

20:20.014 --> 20:23.820
No one could ever be that lucky.

20:20.014 --> 20:23.820
No one could ever be that lucky.

20:23.888 --> 20:27.460
Which is why I choose
the simple explanation.

20:23.888 --> 20:27.460
Which is why I choose
the simple explanation.

20:27.528 --> 20:29.731
I choose to believe
that last night

20:27.528 --> 20:29.731
I choose to believe
that last night

20:29.782 --> 20:32.034
Liz Lemon went out, got some,

20:29.782 --> 20:32.034
Liz Lemon went out, got some,

20:32.102 --> 20:33.254
and felt good about it.

20:32.102 --> 20:33.254
and felt good about it.

20:33.339 --> 20:37.410
And so I say good-bye
to spinsterhood.

20:33.339 --> 20:37.410
And so I say good-bye
to spinsterhood.

20:37.478 --> 20:40.433
Good-bye to giving up
and to...

20:37.478 --> 20:40.433
Good-bye to giving up
and to...

20:40.517 --> 20:42.353
Oh, God, a hawk got her!

20:40.517 --> 20:42.353
Oh, God, a hawk got her!

20:42.420 --> 20:43.555
Emily Dickinson!

20:42.420 --> 20:43.555
