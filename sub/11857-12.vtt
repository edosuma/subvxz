(Darren)
'Don't forget grade
point average.'

00:12.959 --> 00:16.291
While maintaining a 4.0
GPA at Hanford prep.

00:16.375 --> 00:18.917
Extracurriculars, James,
come on.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.750
You're totally
throwing me off, dad.

00:20.834 --> 00:22.166
President of

00:31.250 --> 00:33.250
Come on, let's keep
on point, James.

00:33.333 --> 00:36.667
Alright, next on your
list is your college essay.

00:36.750 --> 00:37.959
Describe your passion.

00:38.041 --> 00:39.792
Passion?

00:39.875 --> 00:41.500
Um..

00:41.583 --> 00:43.792
...a dedication
to a special endeavor.

00:43.875 --> 00:45.792
The college counselors
say this is where they look

00:45.875 --> 00:49.333
for the exceptional,
like founding a charity

00:49.417 --> 00:53.250
or producing a play or
publishing a novella.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.875
He's 17, dad.

00:54.959 --> 00:56.291
Look, if he doesn't
get a scholarship

00:56.375 --> 00:58.125
I can't afford to
send him to college.

00:58.208 --> 01:01.709
No worries, dad
I'll find my passion.

01:01.792 --> 01:03.667
The good news is we still
have plenty of time.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.625
Great, let's watch
"The Naked Chef".

01:05.709 --> 01:08.291
He's off to buy fresh
herbs on his scooter.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.041
Let's go through the
checklist one last time.

01:10.125 --> 01:13.375
Oh, okay. Um, got it, dad.

01:13.458 --> 01:16.208
Find a cure for cancer,
open up a hedge fund

01:16.291 --> 01:19.125
clone some sort of mammal,
perform emergency surgery

01:19.208 --> 01:20.667
then write
"The Great American Novel"

01:20.750 --> 01:22.208
or just put an end
to world hunger

01:22.291 --> 01:24.500
terrorism or male
pattern baldness.

01:24.583 --> 01:25.834
Then write my memoirs.

01:30.417 --> 01:32.834
We'll get her done, dad.

01:32.917 --> 01:34.542
We're right there, James.

01:34.625 --> 01:37.000
We work hard,
we package this right

01:37.083 --> 01:40.667
you'll be able to do
whatever you want.

02:07.125 --> 02:09.500
(Miller)
High school kid, Alexa
Hoffman.

02:09.583 --> 02:11.542
Older brother James
went missing last
year.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.041
What part of town
was that?

02:13.125 --> 02:16.250
Family's from Narberth,
Mainline police handled
it.

02:16.333 --> 02:17.875
So what's she
doing down here?

02:17.959 --> 02:21.542
Said she found some messed
up video clip online.

02:21.625 --> 02:25.875
Alexa, this is
Detective Rush.

02:25.959 --> 02:27.750
You got something
to show us, Alexa?

02:27.834 --> 02:32.208
I was messing around on this
clip site when I found this.

02:38.083 --> 02:39.500
(Miller)
'This for real?'

02:39.583 --> 02:40.750
Yeah.

02:42.166 --> 02:43.625
'How do you know?'

02:43.709 --> 02:46.208
'Cause that's my brother.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.417
Look.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.917
They said he ran away

02:50.000 --> 02:52.041
but James was going away
to college in a year.

02:52.125 --> 02:53.542
It doesn't make sense.

02:55.583 --> 02:56.458
Who posted this?

02:56.542 --> 02:58.458
User name is "rawfodog".

02:58.542 --> 03:00.250
We can track it.

03:01.834 --> 03:03.709
'The assailant's hand..'

03:03.792 --> 03:05.000
'Some kind of tattoo.'

03:05.083 --> 03:06.667
Any idea what
this might be, Alexa?

03:06.750 --> 03:10.083
My brother didn't exactly hang
out with the tattoo crowd.

03:10.166 --> 03:12.000
- He have any enemies?
- No way.

03:12.083 --> 03:16.125
He was top of his class at
Hanford prep, a total geek.

03:17.208 --> 03:19.083
Was your brother using, Alexa?

03:19.166 --> 03:22.750
Drugs? No. Not a chance.

03:22.834 --> 03:24.583
James would never
do that to my dad.

03:24.667 --> 03:27.000
Maybe he had some problems
you didn't know about.

03:27.083 --> 03:29.792
No, you don't understand.
We got really close.

03:29.875 --> 03:32.667
After my mom left, we told
each other everything.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.917
See that mural
in the background?
