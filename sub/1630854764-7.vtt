SOPHIE'S SON (on phone):
<i>Mom? Mom? Mom! Mom!</i>

00:25.275 --> 00:27.235
<i>Will you turn that thing off?
I don't know how much longer</i>

00:27.235 --> 00:29.279
<i>I can watch you sensually dance
with a teddy bear!</i>

00:29.279 --> 00:31.281
Ooh, what's that, Teddy?

00:31.281 --> 00:33.450
You think <i>he</i> should pay
for his own college?

00:33.450 --> 00:35.035
Oh, good idea.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.956
You know, your dad got me one of these

00:39.956 --> 00:42.876
on our very first
Valentine's Day as a couple.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.253
Even before he and I got together,

00:45.253 --> 00:47.922
he had a soft spot for Valentine's Day.

00:47.922 --> 00:50.800
I'm just saying,
Valentine's Day is the worst.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.637
Wait, <i>you're</i> grumpy about Valentine's Day?

00:54.637 --> 00:56.347
What a total curveball!

00:56.347 --> 00:58.683
Do you think it's a "Hallmark holiday"?

00:58.683 --> 01:00.226
Yeah! I do. It's just an excuse

01:00.226 --> 01:01.728
for the greeting card
and chocolate companies--

01:01.728 --> 01:03.521
Alright! Alright.

01:03.521 --> 01:05.356
Not exactly a hot take, man.

01:05.523 --> 01:06.775
Yeah, next, you're
gonna say that TikTok is

01:06.775 --> 01:08.318
shortening our attention span.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.487
It is! Our generation can't even focus--

01:10.487 --> 01:12.864
I don't care what you think, Love Grinch!

01:14.532 --> 01:15.700
Hannah's en route to the city,

01:15.700 --> 01:17.702
and we are gonna Valentine the crap

01:17.702 --> 01:19.329
out of each other all night long.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.789
I love Valentine's Day, too.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.541
Every year, I spend it
with the hottest piece in the city.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.627
This little smoke show right here.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.420
Damn right, she does.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.881
Valentine's Day is our day. We call it...

01:29.881 --> 01:31.800
Svalentine's Day!

01:31.800 --> 01:34.552
Sorry, isn't that what we all call it,
but with less spitting?

01:34.552 --> 01:36.805
No! It's Svalentine's.

01:36.805 --> 01:40.183
Like, Sophie and Valentina's
Valentine's Day.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.893
Svalentine's.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.896
Is it a fresher take
if I hate Svalentine's Day?

01:46.147 --> 01:48.149
I hate this stupid holiday.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.237
Hey, bud. What the hell is this?

01:52.237 --> 01:55.365
It's supposed to be
Rachel's Valentine's Day gift.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.158
Because nothing says, "I love you"

01:57.158 --> 01:59.661
like a romantic candlelight dinner

01:59.661 --> 02:02.664
under a nude frozen likeness
of the woman you love.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.207
But Rachel's aunt broke her hip,

02:04.207 --> 02:05.583
so she went to Florida to help.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.835
Oh, what a sweetheart.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.545
I know! She's extremely caring!

02:09.879 --> 02:12.799
Sorry. Sorry. I was really excited for

02:12.924 --> 02:15.135
our first Valentine's Day
together, and now it's ruined.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.928
Does it make you feel better
to know that I've had

02:17.053 --> 02:20.598
a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad
Valentine's Day before, too?

02:20.598 --> 02:22.851
Aw, sweetie, no.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.687
Why would hearing about your misfortune
make me feel any better?

02:25.687 --> 02:27.188
Aw.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.107
Just kidding. It totally would.
Tell me, tell me, tell me!

02:30.692 --> 02:32.694
Okay. I was 8 years old.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.989
<i>I was making cards
for all the important people in my life.</i>

02:35.989 --> 02:38.241
<i>My mom, my mom's boyfriend, Steve,</i>

02:38.241 --> 02:40.285
<i>my favorite NSYNC member,
Chris Kirkpatrick,</i>

02:40.285 --> 02:42.787
<i>Ruthie and Teck from</i>
The Real World: Hawaii.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.164
Stop right there.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.874
A pre-puberty story doesn't count.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.792
I mean, heartbreak
before your period isn't real.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.545
Oh, okay. Uh, I'm gonna think
of a different one.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.797
Ooh! When I was 13...

02:52.964 --> 02:54.799
Uh, no. You hang up first.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.301
I'm not hanging up first!

02:57.302 --> 02:59.345
It's <i>your</i> turn to hang up first.
<i>You</i> go first.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.430
Next!

03:00.430 --> 03:01.347
Okay, uh, I'll go.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.557
Alright. Um...

03:03.308 --> 03:05.143
My worst St. Valentine's.

03:05.143 --> 03:09.480
Uh, the year was 2012,
and I was a besotted young lad

03:09.480 --> 03:12.609
on a hunting trip in Norfolk
with my family

03:12.609 --> 03:15.153
and my girlfriend, Jacinda Astley.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.946
<i>We were staying</i>

03:16.946 --> 03:18.114
<i>at Houghton Hall,</i>

03:18.114 --> 03:20.783
<i>the estate of my family's dear friends,</i>

03:20.783 --> 03:24.204
<i>David and Rose, the Marquess
and Marchioness of Cholmondeley.</i>

03:24.204 --> 03:26.539
<i>There was a crisp breeze that afternoon,</i>

03:26.539 --> 03:28.416
<i>so I went to close the window.</i>

03:28.416 --> 03:32.045
<i>But the curtains, well,
were fluttering so playfully in the draft</i>

03:32.045 --> 03:34.505
<i>that in the end, I couldn't bear to end</i>

03:34.505 --> 03:37.467
<i>their delightful curtain dance.</i>

03:37.467 --> 03:40.803
Oh, my God! We are telling
Valentine's stories in a bar,

03:40.803 --> 03:43.014
not doing set dec for soft-core porn.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.268
Well, if you're such
a masterful storyteller,

03:47.268 --> 03:48.519
please, regale us.

03:48.519 --> 03:51.564
I would, but all my V-Days
have been straight-up bangers.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.066
Ooh, what about Brendan?

03:53.066 --> 03:55.109
Who's Brendan? Did he suck?

03:55.109 --> 03:57.153
Ooh. Did he call women, "females"?

03:57.362 --> 03:58.238
Well,

03:58.238 --> 03:59.697
it was freshman year of college.

03:59.697 --> 04:01.074
Sophie and I hadn't met yet,

04:01.074 --> 04:03.785
and I thought I was gonna
be the next Lady Gaga.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.703
<i>Brendan was a graphic design major</i>

04:05.703 --> 04:07.372
<i>I'd been dating for a couple of months.</i>

04:08.831 --> 04:11.292
Hi! I'm Valentina.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.378
Sophie Tompkins.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.297
Is today your favorite holiday
because of your name?

04:16.297 --> 04:19.175
That would be like if I was... Halloweena!

04:20.843 --> 04:22.762
Not sure exactly what you're on,

04:22.762 --> 04:24.681
but you should have some water.

04:25.848 --> 04:28.101
Great tip. Thanks.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.979
Are you surprising your boyfriend with
a Valentine's Day gift, too?

04:30.979 --> 04:33.356
Yeah.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.441
It's pictures of my butt.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.777
Like, you sat on a copy machine?

04:37.777 --> 04:39.112
No...

04:39.779 --> 04:41.197
Can I be honest with you?

04:41.197 --> 04:44.117
You could do so much better than Todd.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.787
Todd? Ew! He's legit
the grossest man I've ever met.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.665
Harsh.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.459
Did you ladies come here
just to insult me?

04:53.459 --> 04:54.794
'Cause if you did...

04:56.462 --> 04:59.132
you mind putting these on
and letting me turn my webcam on first?

05:00.675 --> 05:02.302
Turns out, Todd was developing

05:02.302 --> 05:05.138
a glam rock musical version
of <i>Charlotte's Web.</i>

05:05.138 --> 05:06.389
It was actually pretty good.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.433
So, if you aren't here for Todd...

05:08.433 --> 05:10.518
And <i>you're</i> not here for Todd...

05:11.894 --> 05:14.230
- We kissed the same guy?!
- We slept with the same guy?!

05:14.230 --> 05:16.482
Brendan! Legend!

05:16.482 --> 05:18.359
Shut up, Todd!

05:23.323 --> 05:26.743
That lying sack of crap!

05:26.743 --> 05:28.870
That smarmy little ass-clown!

05:28.870 --> 05:30.955
Oh, that sleazy dick-nosed bastard!

05:30.955 --> 05:32.498
Oh, that butthead!

05:32.498 --> 05:34.459
Are you the Amish
exchange student I heard about?

05:34.459 --> 05:36.794
What? No. I could do better.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.963
That jerk! Oh!

05:38.963 --> 05:40.798
And his hair looks so dumb.

05:40.798 --> 05:43.217
No. His hair looks cool.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.471
He was bald by junior year. Hm.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.848
Sometimes, God is good.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.685
Brendan sucks, and we have got to
break up with him.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.772
Oh, we are going to do <i>way</i> more
than break up with him.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.565
We're gonna get revenge.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.650
God, I find being around you exhilarating.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.278
<i>So we grabbed our bats</i>

06:02.278 --> 06:04.864
<i>and went to town on Brendan's bike.</i>

06:05.323 --> 06:08.326
<i>♪ I dug my key into the side ♪</i>

06:08.326 --> 06:11.746
<i>♪ Of his pretty little
souped-up four-wheel-drive ♪</i>

06:11.746 --> 06:14.123
<i>♪ Carved my name into--♪</i>

06:14.123 --> 06:15.833
Hey! What are you guys doing?

06:16.459 --> 06:19.253
You cheat on me, your ride pays the price!

06:19.253 --> 06:23.049
Yeah! Exactly what she said,
but from my perspective!

06:23.883 --> 06:25.593
Uh...

06:25.593 --> 06:26.928
that's not my bike.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.891
So, maybe we tanked our revenge plan,

06:31.891 --> 06:35.561
but that's the night
I met my B-F-F-T-L-A-T-N.

06:35.561 --> 06:39.148
- What?
- Best friends for this life <i>and</i> the next.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.900
We both believe in reincarnation.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.902
Yes, we're coming back
as treasured house cats.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.113
- Same house?
- Same estate.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.533
Are you two serious?

06:48.533 --> 06:51.244
How is a story of your adorable
Valentine's Day meet-cute

06:51.244 --> 06:52.829
supposed to make me feel any better?

06:53.621 --> 06:55.206
- It's not.
- Our bad.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.667
I need something gut-wrenchingly pathetic.

06:57.875 --> 06:58.793
Jesse?

07:00.211 --> 07:01.796
Fine.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.589
I was 10 years old.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.675
Hang on, Ellen said
no pre-puberty stories.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.177
Actually, Jesse went
through puberty in third grade.

07:08.177 --> 07:11.139
Whenever he took me to the playground,
all the kids called him, "sir."

07:11.806 --> 07:14.892
Today's lunch is fish sticks,
tater tots, fruit cup,

07:14.892 --> 07:17.311
and your choice of regular
or chocolate milk.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.355
Okay, guys, I'll let you in
on a little secret.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.565
One girl's advice?

07:20.565 --> 07:22.358
You're gonna wanna go with chocolate.

07:22.358 --> 07:25.361
<i>Mariah Moore
was the first girl I ever liked.</i>

07:25.361 --> 07:26.612
<i>We'd never actually talked,</i>

07:26.612 --> 07:28.072
<i>but I knew all I needed to know.</i>

07:28.072 --> 07:29.323
<i>She was super cute,</i>

07:29.323 --> 07:31.242
<i>she'd read all the</i> Animorphs <i>books,</i>

07:31.242 --> 07:34.162
<i>and her parents had a trampoline. No net.</i>

07:35.079 --> 07:36.747
I love you, Mariah Moore.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.499
I'm at work.

07:40.001 --> 07:43.212
You told a girl you were
in love with her way too soon?

07:43.212 --> 07:45.298
Why does that sound so familiar?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.800
Because he did it to Sophie.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.471
He also did it in middle school.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.764
Oh, yeah, yeah, right. Fine.
There was <i>one</i> other time.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.692
I love you, Olivia DeMarco.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.778
Um, Jerry, is it?

08:09.572 --> 08:11.115
And then, in college.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.536
<i>These Wall Street fat cats</i>

08:15.536 --> 08:18.581
<i>have stolen from America's working class!</i>

08:18.581 --> 08:19.624
Yes!

08:20.124 --> 08:22.376
<i>But do you know who
really belongs behind bars?</i>

08:22.376 --> 08:24.253
<i>Clarissa Yang.</i>

08:25.338 --> 08:27.381
<i>Because you stole my heart, Clarissa.</i>

08:27.381 --> 08:28.591
<i>I love you!</i>

08:28.591 --> 08:31.385
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

08:31.385 --> 08:32.678
Oh!

08:32.929 --> 08:36.182
So you say, "I love you"
early on to, like, everyone.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.518
Well, you'll be happy to know
that all those people hated it

08:38.518 --> 08:40.561
just as much as you did.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.814
Cool. Noted.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.066
Wait, are you actually upset about this?

08:45.066 --> 08:46.859
No. I don't care.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.444
- Great.
- Great.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.570
Great.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.491
Sorry. When I get uncomfortable,

08:53.491 --> 08:55.117
I get Scottish.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.375
Stop glaring at me!

09:02.542 --> 09:03.626
Oh, you don't love that

09:03.751 --> 09:06.087
like you love every woman you lay eyes on?

09:06.629 --> 09:09.131
Alright! Back to me then. Um...

09:10.007 --> 09:11.842
I have processed your critiques,

09:11.842 --> 09:14.303
and I am ready to tell
my story succinctly.

09:15.012 --> 09:18.057
So, we're at Houghton Hall,
awaiting the arrival

09:18.057 --> 09:21.978
of my beloved girlfriend, Jacinda Astley.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.272
And, uh, I wanted things
to be extra special

09:24.272 --> 09:26.816
because, well,
I'd always had a bit of a thing

09:26.816 --> 09:28.734
for old St Valentine's.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.654
And, Jacinda Astley...

09:31.654 --> 09:33.322
was a <i>lady.</i>

09:33.322 --> 09:36.075
<i>And though the Astleys
were incredibly well-esteemed,</i>

09:36.075 --> 09:39.829
<i>their family name had not
gone unmarred by scandal.</i>

09:39.829 --> 09:44.000
<i>Rumor has it, her great-aunt was sired
not by Lord Phillip Astley,</i>

09:44.000 --> 09:46.502
<i>but by a mere stable boy,</i>

09:46.502 --> 09:48.796
of Wolverhampton!

09:48.796 --> 09:51.340
- No!
- Yes! And it gets even better--

09:51.340 --> 09:53.259
Dude, I'm not "no-ing" you.
Nobody's listening to you.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.303
- Mean.
- True.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.597
They're diverting
Hannah's flight to Houston

09:57.597 --> 09:59.140
'cause someone said they were
having a heart attack.

09:59.348 --> 10:02.560
Like, dude, how hard is it to just ignore
your body's signals

10:02.560 --> 10:04.395
until it's too late like the rest of us?

10:04.395 --> 10:07.356
So, Hannah will get in tomorrow.
Is that such a big deal?

10:07.356 --> 10:08.691
Yes.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.151
Spending Valentine's
Day together is, like,

10:10.151 --> 10:12.194
super important to us.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.113
'Cause of <i>our</i> worst one ever.

10:14.113 --> 10:17.199
That sounds awful. Tell us everything.

10:17.658 --> 10:20.453
Okay, so Hannah and I
are still in med school,

10:20.453 --> 10:22.788
and we just started dating,
so we weren't exclusive yet.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.749
Come on, man! Just have one drink with me

10:24.749 --> 10:26.292
at the McLarens' place downstairs.

10:26.709 --> 10:27.752
Hey...

10:27.752 --> 10:28.961
<i>We can mack on</i>

10:28.961 --> 10:30.713
<i>some sweet Valentine's Day honeys.</i>

10:30.713 --> 10:34.675
Sid, you're not a virgin.
Why are you talking like one?

10:34.675 --> 10:36.052
Also, you <i>have</i> a girlfriend.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.179
Hannah is not my girlfriend, okay?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.890
I'm a playboy. I can't be tied down.

10:41.682 --> 10:42.683
What the...

10:44.060 --> 10:45.811
Look at this photo Hannah just posted.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.313
Why is she all up on this dude?

10:47.313 --> 10:51.067
Whoa. Looks like she's out
being a play<i>girl</i>, huh?

10:51.484 --> 10:52.610
Oh, my God, I'm an idiot.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.986
Dude, I am done playing games.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.030
I gotta go tell Hannah
she's the only one for me,

10:56.030 --> 10:57.990
and <i>you</i> are coming, too!

10:57.990 --> 10:59.617
Alright, fine, I'll go with you,

10:59.617 --> 11:01.494
but I'm not putting on real pants, okay?

11:01.494 --> 11:04.288
Because Valentine's Day is a stupid--

11:08.834 --> 11:10.461
Now, focus. If <i>you</i>

11:10.461 --> 11:12.213
were a gorgeous young med student

11:12.213 --> 11:14.048
about to throw away the love of your life,

11:14.048 --> 11:15.800
- where would you--
- It's a very small apartment, okay?

11:15.800 --> 11:16.967
They're right there.

11:20.096 --> 11:23.057
Okay. Come on. Jesse, dance.
Act like we're having fun.

11:23.057 --> 11:25.017
What? Why? I thought we were here
so you could tell Hannah

11:25.017 --> 11:26.894
- how you feel about her.
- Yeah, I was,

11:26.894 --> 11:28.854
but I'm pissed she's having
so much fun without me.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.107
I want her to see that I have fun
without her, too, you know?

11:31.107 --> 11:33.526
By dancing with me?

11:33.526 --> 11:36.112
Come on, Jesse! We didn't
practice Dougie-ing for nothing, okay?

11:42.243 --> 11:43.536
Ha! Ha!

11:47.748 --> 11:50.501
- Jesse! Running man! Now!
- Are we in a dance-off?

11:50.501 --> 11:52.795
Oh, I am! I don't know
what the hell you're doing!

11:53.587 --> 11:56.298
What's up? What's up? Wh-- Ow! Oh! Cramp!

11:56.298 --> 11:58.551
Are you okay?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.429
That is enough! Can you stop
massaging him right now, please?

12:02.638 --> 12:04.974
Hannah, I want to be your boyfriend.
I want you to be my girlfriend.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.892
I want this guy to just go away.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.728
Ha! I knew it.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.730
- Thanks for your help, Drew-shi.
- Of course.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.982
Drew-shi is a dish best served cold.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.900
Wait, what?

12:15.359 --> 12:16.485
Did you set me up?

12:16.485 --> 12:18.070
Hell yeah, I did.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.613
Look, Hannah knew if we made you jelly,

12:19.613 --> 12:20.865
you'd make things official.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.283
That's why I brought out the big guns.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.325
What's up?

12:23.325 --> 12:24.910
I can do that, too.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.079
Am I doing it?

12:27.079 --> 12:28.539
No...

12:30.040 --> 12:32.126
Look, glad I could help cupid you guys.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.795
The way she talks about you,
I knew you got something special.

12:34.795 --> 12:38.007
And people who love each other
should be together on Valentine's Day.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.885
That's why I'm gonna go hang out
with my mom. Later.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.389
I can't believe you tricked me.
That's, like, supes immature.

12:45.389 --> 12:48.726
- Seriously? You're mad?
- Yeah.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.020
You've been acting for weeks
like you don't want to be my boyfriend.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.396
<i>That's</i> immature.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.814
We proceeded to have

12:53.814 --> 12:56.358
the kind of awful, horrible,
screaming, crying fight

12:56.358 --> 12:57.818
that you only have in your 20s.

12:57.818 --> 13:00.321
- I hate you.
- I hate you, too!

13:04.909 --> 13:07.912
I love you... Sweatpants Girl.

13:10.539 --> 13:11.540
Seriously?

13:11.749 --> 13:13.459
That one doesn't count!

13:14.251 --> 13:16.253
Have... you met molly?

13:19.089 --> 13:21.634
I also said, "I love you"
to my cab driver,

13:21.634 --> 13:24.178
a fat pigeon, a-and a trash can

13:24.178 --> 13:26.180
I could "feel" had a soul.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.892
Anyway, um,
that night, neither of us slept,

13:29.892 --> 13:31.185
and when the sun came up,

13:31.185 --> 13:34.063
we both realized why. Um...

13:34.563 --> 13:36.774
the only thing we really wanted
was each other.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.237
Hi.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.323
- Hi.
- I, uh,

13:44.323 --> 13:45.908
I made you this.

13:46.700 --> 13:50.120
You arranged a bunch of bagels
in the shape of balls?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.705
Huh? No. Oh!

13:51.705 --> 13:53.874
It's supposed to be a heart.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.584
Made of everything bagels 'cause--

13:57.127 --> 13:58.629
'cause you're my everything.

13:59.588 --> 14:02.633
And you used cream cheese for the glue!

14:02.633 --> 14:03.759
Mm-hmm.

14:06.178 --> 14:09.557
And we haven't spent
Valentine's Day apart since.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.475
- Until now.
- Aw...

14:11.475 --> 14:14.103
Oh, Jesse, those two
old ladies are leaving.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.021
Don't forget to tell 'em both
you love 'em.

14:16.021 --> 14:19.024
I really don't get it.
How are you actually pissed about this?

14:19.024 --> 14:22.278
I'm not pissed. I'm... irked.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.322
You guys get why, right?

14:26.115 --> 14:27.950
No. No. Not really.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.785
Oh, my God. Fine.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.707
When you told me you loved me
on our <i>first</i> date,

14:34.707 --> 14:36.333
yes, that freaked me out.

14:36.333 --> 14:39.420
But it also made me feel... special.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.048
And then hearing that
you've said those same words

14:43.048 --> 14:45.885
to roughly one in four American women,

14:45.885 --> 14:47.469
that makes me feel...

14:49.680 --> 14:51.849
Less special?

14:53.601 --> 14:56.812
This was way too intimate
to say in front of everyone.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.857
I'm gonna get
a very strong drink.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.026
Oh! Why am I doing it?

15:07.197 --> 15:10.326
S-so, Ellen? We were thinking--

15:10.326 --> 15:12.953
No, you can't use Ice Rachel
as a vodka luge.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.289
Surprise!

15:15.831 --> 15:16.999
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

15:16.999 --> 15:18.250
- You're here!
- I am!

15:18.250 --> 15:21.253
Oh, I pulled a full "mom from <i>Home Alone</i>"

15:21.253 --> 15:23.631
and cried my way onto a new flight.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.050
My favorite girl
referencing my favorite movie

15:26.050 --> 15:27.801
on my favorite day of the year?

15:27.801 --> 15:29.887
I love this holiday!

15:31.096 --> 15:34.391
I have an announcement!
Hello, Hannah. Welcome back.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.226
I have taken your collective feedback

15:36.226 --> 15:39.063
and distilled my story
into four sentences.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.900
My girlfriend was coming to visit me
in the country for Valentine's Day.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.070
I decided to surprise her
by wearing nothing but whipped cream.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.207
Are the cherries too much?

15:58.207 --> 16:01.377
No. You look scrumptious, sir.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.886
I lay there all night waiting,

16:12.012 --> 16:12.972
and she stood me up.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.890
I wound up with a broken heart...

16:16.141 --> 16:17.643
and a yeast infection.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.270
Which I didn't even know men could get.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.190
That's a pretty good story!

16:23.190 --> 16:25.901
I got a double cheese pizza
from Little Caesar's

16:25.901 --> 16:27.528
for... Ellen Gilbert.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.828
<i>Happy Valentine's Day, baby.</i>

16:35.828 --> 16:38.914
<i>I figured if we ate
the same thing together on FaceTime,</i>

16:38.914 --> 16:40.582
<i>it'd almost be like we were together.</i>

16:40.582 --> 16:42.251
This is perfect.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.670
I should have known
you would make today amazing.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.171
Aw...

16:46.171 --> 16:48.257
This is a private moment
between me and my girlfriend!

16:50.175 --> 16:51.510
Just kidding.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.304
We're cute as hell,
and I accept your "aw's."

16:55.764 --> 16:57.850
Hey. Look.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.476
Yes, when I was younger, I threw out

16:59.476 --> 17:01.854
a lot of, "I love you's"
with reckless abandon.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.815
Okay? But then, I stopped. For many years.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.775
- You did?
- I did.

17:07.735 --> 17:10.070
And, you know, after Meredith left me,

17:10.070 --> 17:12.948
I-I-I thought I'd never say it again, and...

17:13.949 --> 17:14.992
then I met you.

17:17.578 --> 17:18.620
Got it.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.875
Thank you for... clearing that up for me.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.127
I feel less irked.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.253
Good.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.546
Okay, so finish your story.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.672
Wh-what happened to you

17:28.672 --> 17:30.340
on Valentine's Day in third grade?

17:30.340 --> 17:32.801
There was a father-daughter
dance at school,

17:32.801 --> 17:36.638
and I put fliers
with my picture up all over town

17:36.638 --> 17:39.016
in hopes that my dad would see it

17:39.016 --> 17:40.434
and come and surprise me.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.519
Did your dad live in your town?

17:42.519 --> 17:47.649
No idea. My mom only told me
that they slept together one time

17:47.649 --> 17:49.151
at the first Lollapalooza.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.528
- Wow.
- Yeah. She actually said "Did the nasty,"

17:51.528 --> 17:52.988
but I was trying to spare you.

17:52.988 --> 17:56.742
Thank you. Okay, so-so-so what happened?

17:57.367 --> 17:59.661
I stood in the middle of the dance floor,

18:00.162 --> 18:02.039
hoping my long-lost father

18:02.039 --> 18:03.499
would walk through the door
and surprise me.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.585
And after a while, a guy
I'd never seen before showed up.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.670
- Someone else's dad.
- I wish.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.715
Just a-- a neighborhood pervert.

18:11.715 --> 18:14.384
- Oh.
- Security tackled him pretty fast.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.553
But, in retrospect,

18:16.553 --> 18:20.390
putting up pictures of a little girl
with the caption

18:20.390 --> 18:23.393
"Daddy, come dance with me,"
was not a good idea.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.896
Oh, my God.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.982
The police said I saved
a lot of lives in the end.

18:28.982 --> 18:31.401
- Huh...
- What?

18:31.401 --> 18:36.156
Well, it's just you have
a real reason to <i>hate</i> this day.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.535
But you just throw on a smile
and spend it with Val

18:39.535 --> 18:41.954
and have a ridiculously
good attitude about it.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.956
H-how do you do that?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.333
What is my other option? To act like you?

18:46.333 --> 18:48.168
I-I'm serious.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.170
Chocolate helps.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.673
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.763
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

18:59.763 --> 19:02.391
You know, maybe
Valentine's Day is not that bad.

19:04.476 --> 19:07.521
You see, son, love just feels good.

19:07.896 --> 19:10.107
Especially on Valentine's Day.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.818
Just ask your dad.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.069
And people who love each other

19:14.069 --> 19:15.946
should be together on Valentine's Day.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.657
I'd always had a bit of a thing
for old Saint Valentine's.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.159
Oh, my God, I love this holiday.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.744
You know, maybe
Valentine's Day is not that bad.

19:22.744 --> 19:24.454
I freaking love Valentine's Day.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.748
SOPHIE'S SON:
<i>He wasn't even in this story.</i>

19:26.748 --> 19:29.418
<i>Wait, did I miss something?</i>

19:29.418 --> 19:31.211
Different Valentine's Day.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.963
We'll get there.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.134
I'm sure she'll be here <i>any</i> minute.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.096
- Right, Rupert?
- Of course, she will, sir.
