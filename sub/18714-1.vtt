00:18.962 --> 00:20.498
Okay, now what?

00:20.598 --> 00:23.003
Now you say the phrase that starts the game.

00:23.805 --> 00:26.639
I'm not gonna say it. You say it.

00:27.605 --> 00:29.877
You say it, it was your idea.

00:38.450 --> 00:41.419
Hey! Can you help us with something?

00:41.519 --> 00:43.384
It'll just take a second.

00:43.484 --> 00:46.579
- Okay. Hang on.
- Okay.

00:58.035 --> 01:00.906
- You guys, I don't have time for this.
- Come on.

01:01.006 --> 01:04.394
I have mid-terms next week,
and I'm so far behind!

01:04.495 --> 01:06.311
Please?

01:06.411 --> 01:08.033
Please?

01:08.612 --> 01:10.136
Fine.

01:11.682 --> 01:14.753
Charlie Charlie, can we play?
There, I said it.

01:14.853 --> 01:17.857
No wait, say it again, it didn't hear you.

01:19.107 --> 01:21.518
Charlie Charlie, can we play?

01:26.697 --> 01:30.357
Charlie Charlie, can these two idiots
play your stupid game?

01:45.583 --> 01:47.778
Whatever, stop it.

01:50.088 --> 01:52.791
Rachel, what's going on? Rachel, breathe!

01:52.891 --> 01:55.499
Oh, God, what do we do? Rachel, what do we...

02:42.172 --> 02:43.996
Oh, God.

02:53.950 --> 02:55.774
Oh, God.

02:55.986 --> 02:57.288
Gwen!

02:57.388 --> 02:58.811
Gwen!

03:11.635 --> 03:13.059
Gwen?

03:15.138 --> 03:16.562
Gwen?

03:27.551 --> 03:29.375
Oh, God.

05:46.557 --> 05:48.159
It's not like we get paid.

05:48.259 --> 05:50.884
You and I could go do something after.

06:03.240 --> 06:06.344
Hey, hey, I heard there was
a wreck on the highway.

06:06.444 --> 06:10.228
Heard some little smart car ran over
a blade of grass or something...

06:10.328 --> 06:12.250
...and it flipped like 20 times.

06:12.350 --> 06:14.774
But there was a lot of blood.

06:15.819 --> 06:20.324
Anyway, hey, what I'm sayin' is,
maybe that's why nobody's here?

06:20.424 --> 06:22.668
Maybe they're all stuck on the highway.

06:23.161 --> 06:27.131
Alice, we've been open for five hours now.

06:27.231 --> 06:30.080
A smart car that's been
in a tiny little fender bender...

06:30.180 --> 06:34.772
...wouldn't explain why there's
nobody here lining up to get tickets.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.275
So if you're not busy selling anything...

06:37.375 --> 06:42.266
...could you just keep your mouth shut?

06:45.982 --> 06:48.432
I'm just saying it was ironic, is all.

06:48.532 --> 06:51.934
I mean, it's a smart car, right?
It's supposed to be smart and it's...

07:26.506 --> 07:28.911
Let's just close up for the night.

07:30.861 --> 07:34.999
I'm gonna go to my office,
why don't you tell the other actors?

07:35.099 --> 07:37.368
Well, hey, wait, but you said I can't...

07:37.468 --> 07:41.726
...I should keep my mouth shut
if I'm not selling tickets. Can I...

07:42.384 --> 07:46.110
- What do I... I don't...
- <i>Hi, I'm Karen Arnold for Tiptop News.</i>

07:46.210 --> 07:50.047
<i>Have you been to a haunted house this year?
Well, neither has anyone else.</i>

07:51.688 --> 07:53.525
Gene, you in there?

07:54.085 --> 07:55.639
No!

07:56.586 --> 07:59.357
Gene, open up!
We need to talk to you right now!

07:59.457 --> 08:00.970
We?

08:03.293 --> 08:05.963
Listen, man.
I'm tryin' to be cool about this.

08:06.063 --> 08:09.935
We have been working for you for
three weeks and haven't been paid.

08:10.635 --> 08:14.105
Now we demand tonight that you pay us.

08:14.705 --> 08:16.974
Well, actually, he's demanding.

08:17.074 --> 08:19.801
- I'm just asking.
- Shut up.

08:19.901 --> 08:23.359
Right, paychecks. Let me see.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.065
Let me check here.

08:28.718 --> 08:30.600
Not there.

08:33.323 --> 08:36.894
Oh, that's right,
they're around back on the money tree.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.183
While you're back there,
why don't you grab mine too?

08:39.283 --> 08:40.809
Sweet!

08:41.563 --> 08:44.101
- Okay.
- Look, man.

08:44.201 --> 08:45.770
No more jokes.

08:45.870 --> 08:49.540
Now I need my money,
and I need it tonight. Or else.

08:49.640 --> 08:51.642
- Or else?
- Yeah.

08:51.742 --> 08:56.381
Or else what? I don't have any money, fellas.

08:56.681 --> 08:59.250
We don't have any customers.

08:59.350 --> 09:03.388
No customers equals no money,
do you understand?

09:03.888 --> 09:07.194
I would love to pay you two.
Because there's a lot of other things...

09:07.294 --> 09:10.508
...I'd rather be doing right now
than dealing with this!

09:12.697 --> 09:16.667
Here's a thought. Why don't you two
geniuses put your brains together...

09:16.767 --> 09:19.620
...and come up with some amazing
new way to draw in some business?

09:19.720 --> 09:22.900
Because I don't have any ideas left!

09:23.000 --> 09:24.821
We could...

09:26.142 --> 09:29.424
That's not our problem, it's yours!

09:29.947 --> 09:32.383
- You figure it out.
- <i>Move over ouija board...</i>

09:32.483 --> 09:37.088
<i>...there's a new game in town and his name
is Charlie. Charlie Charlie, actually.</i>

09:37.188 --> 09:41.425
<i>It's the Internet sensation that has
all of America's youth trembling with fear.</i>

09:41.525 --> 09:43.794
<i>The game seems to have gotten
out of hand a little.</i>

09:43.894 --> 09:47.523
<i>21-year-old Ryder Allen was charged
several months ago with multiple counts...</i>

09:47.623 --> 09:50.568
<i>...of first-degree murder
after playing the game with friends.</i>

09:50.668 --> 09:53.271
<i>The charges were later dropped
due to lack of evidence.</i>

09:53.371 --> 09:56.360
<i>Allen insisted on her innocence,
saying her friends were killed...</i>

09:56.460 --> 09:58.976
<i>...by a demon summoned by the game.</i>

09:59.076 --> 10:01.960
<i>That footage of Karen Arnold
was recorded previously today...</i>

10:02.060 --> 10:05.483
<i>...from the front lawn
of the double-homicide sorority house.</i>

10:05.583 --> 10:08.152
<i>And continuing breaking news
about that murder case</i>

10:08.252 --> 10:10.488
<i>...involving local
college student Ryder Allen.</i>

10:10.588 --> 10:12.513
Guys...

10:12.613 --> 10:15.299
...I think I actually have a new idea.

10:16.057 --> 10:19.344
All right, we need something
to draw in new interest, right?

10:19.864 --> 10:22.533
We need something
to really strike terror and fear...

10:22.633 --> 10:25.836
...in the minds of those little bastards!

10:25.936 --> 10:27.637
Like what?

10:27.737 --> 10:29.540
Like Lizzie Borden.

10:29.640 --> 10:32.576
Bloody Mary. The stuff of legends!

10:32.676 --> 10:34.723
Except new!

10:36.012 --> 10:37.883
What are you gettin' at?

10:39.082 --> 10:42.119
I'm thinking we have kids
over here after hours.

10:42.219 --> 10:44.822
You see, we could come up
with a new challenge for 'em.

10:44.922 --> 10:47.170
A challenge based on...

10:47.757 --> 10:51.956
- ...based on that!
- <i>A game she's calling Charlie Charlie.</i>

10:52.396 --> 10:54.465
<i>A new team of investigators
have been hired...</i>

10:54.565 --> 10:57.468
So we invite kids in here...

10:57.568 --> 11:00.772
...and we have 'em play a game or something?

11:01.172 --> 11:03.220
And then we scare 'em!

11:04.240 --> 11:07.790
Yeah, but don't hurt yourselves.

11:08.745 --> 11:12.360
And then we scare them.

11:13.983 --> 11:15.565
Better.

11:18.555 --> 11:23.423
All right, so the plan is we're gonna
have kids here after hours...

11:23.523 --> 11:27.744
...we're just gonna let 'em run around
for a while and scare the hell out of 'em!

11:30.301 --> 11:33.934
If I do this, you better pay me overtime.

11:34.608 --> 11:36.440
Paulie, my boy...

11:36.540 --> 11:38.843
...when news about this story gets out...

11:38.943 --> 11:40.745
...and what we're about to do
with this house...

11:40.845 --> 11:44.928
...teens will be lining up from across
the state just to get in here!

11:45.816 --> 11:49.186
<i>Thanks for watching the nightly
Channel Six Tiptop News.</i>

11:49.286 --> 11:52.723
<i>I'm Peter Hanes, with one final question.</i>

11:52.823 --> 11:55.259
<i>If miss Allen did not kill her roommates...</i>

11:55.359 --> 11:58.241
<i>...then who, or what did?</i>

12:17.747 --> 12:19.295
Now.

12:20.583 --> 12:22.432
For the flier.

12:24.754 --> 12:26.636
I need the big pen.

12:27.624 --> 12:29.176
Yes.

12:32.095 --> 12:33.743
Charlie...

12:35.331 --> 12:36.979
...Charlie...

12:39.736 --> 12:41.384
...challenge.

12:42.672 --> 12:44.524
Is that with two l's?

13:00.957 --> 13:02.505
Yes.

13:12.369 --> 13:15.406
Okay, so you're gonna be careful, right?
You're gonna call me when you're done.

13:15.506 --> 13:18.542
And you're gonna keep your hands off
my sister and you're gonna take care of her.

13:18.642 --> 13:21.079
Yeah, dude, it's fine, it's no problem.

13:21.879 --> 13:24.896
Hey, man, it's all right,
we'll watch after her.

13:29.819 --> 13:31.834
We're gonna be fine.

13:55.812 --> 13:58.864
I've been expecting you!

14:07.190 --> 14:10.594
Seriously, guys, I've been waiting here
since midnight, where ya been?

14:10.694 --> 14:12.563
Well, this...

14:12.663 --> 14:14.677
Midnight, sharp.

14:15.932 --> 14:19.404
Great. No big deal,
the point is you're here now.

14:20.304 --> 14:23.240
So welcome to Hangman's House Of Horrors...

14:23.340 --> 14:25.822
...Charlie Charlie Challenge!

14:26.276 --> 14:29.358
Came up with that myself,
has a certain ring to it.

14:30.381 --> 14:34.060
Before we begin,
it's time to lay a little ground rules.

14:35.219 --> 14:37.888
Fine. But can we go inside?

14:37.988 --> 14:42.293
These are real designer shoes
and I try not to wear 'em on concrete.

14:42.393 --> 14:44.742
Try not to wear them on concrete?

14:45.553 --> 14:47.799
They're real designer shoes.

14:48.299 --> 14:51.769
So... let's get down to it, shall we?

14:51.869 --> 14:54.371
The challenge begins when the game does.

14:54.471 --> 14:58.126
I will be escorting you
to a specific location in this house...

14:58.226 --> 15:01.111
...which I've already
laid out the game for you.

15:01.437 --> 15:03.247
What's your name?

15:03.847 --> 15:08.931
It's Gene, but everyone here
calls me The Ringmaster!

15:09.552 --> 15:12.636
Okay, Gene, where is everybody?

15:15.091 --> 15:18.464
They're off for tonight, I thought
it would be a hell of a lot scarier...

15:18.564 --> 15:20.613
...if they weren't kinda hangin' around.

15:20.713 --> 15:24.168
Which means you will all be here
overnight by yourselves.

15:24.268 --> 15:26.637
So please be careful.

15:26.737 --> 15:30.876
Which reminds me, my attorney prepared...

15:31.174 --> 15:34.391
...these tiny little contracts
for you to sign.

15:35.712 --> 15:38.949
Hopefully this will stop you from...

15:39.049 --> 15:43.515
...suing on the slight chance
of any kind of accident.

15:43.888 --> 15:46.007
Here's some pens, pass 'em around.

15:46.357 --> 15:50.018
I'm also told I'm required to say that
playing the Charlie Charlie Challenge...

15:50.118 --> 15:53.131
...is strictly for entertainment
purposes only.

15:54.031 --> 15:58.302
You cannot actually summon a demon
and the game is just that, a game.

15:58.402 --> 16:00.283
Yes, you can.

16:02.140 --> 16:05.071
It says on this website that not
too long ago a group of friends...

16:05.171 --> 16:08.846
...were playing and all
and one person died. Ryder Allen?

16:08.946 --> 16:11.816
She said that they actually summoned
a demon or something.

16:12.316 --> 16:14.943
Yeah, that's when the game became popular.

16:15.602 --> 16:19.407
Most people that knew the sorority girls
said that Ryder killed 'em.

16:20.657 --> 16:24.262
Some people say that the demon
made her kill 'em.

16:24.862 --> 16:28.144
Others say... she was crazy.

16:29.032 --> 16:30.847
Probably just mid-terms.

16:32.869 --> 16:36.607
Well, I guess if it was on the Internet,
it must be true!

16:36.707 --> 16:38.942
And it says that she wasn't
charged with anything.

16:39.042 --> 16:41.491
Like, lack of evidence or something.

16:42.446 --> 16:46.083
Well, that's sad. And it's very terrible.

16:46.183 --> 16:51.010
So if you would just please
pass forward your... contracts.

16:51.588 --> 16:53.470
Thank you very much.

16:56.893 --> 16:59.708
Now, if you will all follow me, please.

17:01.964 --> 17:05.578
There is one little thing I forgot to do.

17:06.069 --> 17:08.317
Collect the admission price.

17:09.673 --> 17:11.474
Is it the price of our souls?

17:13.025 --> 17:15.888
Really? But we all won a ticket to play.

17:16.279 --> 17:20.451
Actually, you just won a chance to come
here after hours and play the game.

17:20.550 --> 17:23.020
I still have rent and electricity to pay for.

17:23.119 --> 17:26.402
Besides, I already gave both of 'em...

17:27.490 --> 17:31.340
...I mean, all of you have five dollars off!

17:33.363 --> 17:35.241
It's 20 dollars each.

17:37.233 --> 17:38.848
Whatever, man.

17:44.607 --> 17:46.621
All appears to be there.

17:47.211 --> 17:51.694
Don't be afraid, or do be afraid,
as long as you come on in.

18:09.933 --> 18:12.569
Now, before I go any further...

18:12.669 --> 18:18.154
...I must insist that all cellular phones
and mobile devices be placed in...

18:19.709 --> 18:21.212
..my...

18:23.680 --> 18:25.078
...hat.

18:27.518 --> 18:29.820
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm sorry...

18:29.920 --> 18:33.657
...but isn't that like,
against the constitution or something?

18:33.757 --> 18:36.290
Like denying our right to speech?

18:37.949 --> 18:39.331
No...

18:39.529 --> 18:42.075
...I don't think so.

18:42.175 --> 18:45.903
Please understand
that this challenge has rules.

18:46.003 --> 18:51.053
And in order to win the grand prize
at the end of it, you must cooperate!

19:12.729 --> 19:14.230
Yes.

19:16.266 --> 19:19.236
Now this is no ordinary challenge.

19:19.336 --> 19:22.339
You see, Charlie Charlie was an evil spirit.

19:22.439 --> 19:25.409
His very soul was vanquished
from the netherworlds...

19:25.509 --> 19:28.312
...and rooted right in this very house.

19:28.612 --> 19:30.159
Tonight...

19:31.047 --> 19:34.518
...if you are brave enough,
you will summon him.

19:35.018 --> 19:39.922
And we dare for you to ask him
just a few random questions.

19:40.022 --> 19:42.659
And if you make it out alive...

19:42.759 --> 19:46.207
...your grand prize awaits you!

19:46.530 --> 19:48.692
Our grand prize that we paid for?

19:50.133 --> 19:52.585
- Wait, what was that?
- Never mind.

19:53.469 --> 19:55.386
Right this way!

20:07.116 --> 20:09.165
And here we are!

20:09.652 --> 20:11.467
What do you think?

20:12.088 --> 20:14.132
Please, everyone grab a chair.

20:14.558 --> 20:17.373
Sorry, I didn't expect a fifth wheel.

20:21.130 --> 20:24.614
Here you are. Make room, make room.

20:28.771 --> 20:32.176
Now, the history of the spirit is unknown.

20:32.476 --> 20:35.779
Most speculate that it was
a young boy in a border town.

20:35.879 --> 20:39.562
A bastard child raised by Mexican satanists!

20:41.317 --> 20:43.620
When that young boy died...

20:43.720 --> 20:46.769
...his dear mother couldn't stand it.

20:48.457 --> 20:51.676
So she cast a devil spell on his soul!

20:52.628 --> 20:55.712
She wanted to make sure her little boy lived.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.382
He lived, all right.

20:59.769 --> 21:01.851
He lived to kill!

21:07.148 --> 21:10.890
At least, that's what some people say.

21:10.990 --> 21:12.795
Nothing confirmed.

21:13.716 --> 21:16.031
So why pencils?

21:17.053 --> 21:18.923
Good question.

21:19.723 --> 21:23.407
You see, they believed
they needed something called...

21:23.927 --> 21:28.944
...pardon the pronunciation,
<i>cupressus lusitanica...</i>

21:29.398 --> 21:32.289
...otherwise known as Mexican cypress.

21:32.970 --> 21:37.263
They thought it was grown naturally
in the same small town as the boy.

21:38.778 --> 21:40.806
To start, you would...

21:44.814 --> 21:48.019
...place the pencils in the form of a cross.

21:48.919 --> 21:52.546
One balanced perfectly on top of the other.

21:53.423 --> 21:56.434
Then it could be used
as a dial to communicate.

21:58.328 --> 22:01.337
All you'd have to do now is ask a question.

22:03.832 --> 22:05.835
As you can see...

22:05.935 --> 22:08.879
I did not balance these pencils.

22:08.979 --> 22:12.388
Nor did I ask any questions, so...

22:12.488 --> 22:14.974
...no harm no foul, right?

22:19.015 --> 22:21.752
God, this is so stupid.

22:21.852 --> 22:25.188
Okay, so basically we have
to pretend like we're scared...

22:25.288 --> 22:29.392
...and I'm sure you have all your people
positioned all around to scare us...

22:29.492 --> 22:32.775
...and we finish and we win a prize?

22:32.875 --> 22:35.444
So, what's the prize?

22:36.232 --> 22:40.204
The prize, right, well, I assure you
that the prize is grand!

22:40.304 --> 22:44.041
And I also assure you that you
will be alone here for the night.

22:44.141 --> 22:49.079
So, I will be leaving now,
and be kind to the house...

22:49.179 --> 22:51.815
...because we are open again tomorrow night.

22:51.915 --> 22:54.430
Hope you all will live,
I'd hate to come here in the morning...

22:54.530 --> 22:56.787
...and have to mop up a lot of blood.

22:56.887 --> 23:00.524
Because that sort of thing
attracts a lot of negative attention.

23:00.624 --> 23:04.063
And reporters. And who needs publicity?

23:06.663 --> 23:11.146
Right. So... I'll be leaving now.

23:13.069 --> 23:14.951
So enjoy the house.

23:18.107 --> 23:19.955
Seriously though...

23:21.978 --> 23:23.826
...be careful.

23:33.357 --> 23:35.637
- Gene!
- God.

23:37.460 --> 23:39.896
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be getting ready.

23:39.996 --> 23:42.633
Well, I just wanted to know
when we can start.

23:43.233 --> 23:47.604
- What are you doing in costume?
- So I can scare 'em, duh!

23:47.704 --> 23:49.272
Damn it, Jerry.

23:49.372 --> 23:53.510
Charlie Charlie is a Mexican demon,
not some clown.

23:53.610 --> 23:56.959
And not some fat clown in his 40s!

23:57.580 --> 24:00.028
I'm 39, Gene.

24:01.183 --> 24:03.654
Stanley is playing the demon.

24:03.754 --> 24:06.489
Why don't you go out there
and help Paulie make some racket?

24:06.589 --> 24:09.493
Grab a rake and drag it up
and down the hallway or something...

24:09.593 --> 24:12.397
...just don't let 'em see you wearing this.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.248
A clown.

24:32.181 --> 24:34.251
What the hell are you wearing?

24:34.951 --> 24:37.766
This is my Charlie Charlie outfit.

24:38.555 --> 24:40.558
It's pretty cool?

24:41.158 --> 24:43.260
No, no, no, are you kidding me?

24:43.360 --> 24:46.763
I told you he was
a terrifying Mexican demon...

24:46.863 --> 24:49.934
...you look like you're part
of a mariachi band.

24:51.434 --> 24:55.940
Well, this sombrero is from a mariachi
band that my cousin's in...

24:56.040 --> 24:58.375
...so that's probably
what you're thinking of.

24:58.475 --> 25:03.079
And then this, I...
well, I borrowed it from a latino family...

25:03.179 --> 25:07.217
...that was at a picnic or something,
I was just like, "can I borrow that?"

25:07.317 --> 25:10.854
And then, but my makeup
is pretty scary, right?

25:10.954 --> 25:14.291
It's like scary ghost makeup.

25:14.391 --> 25:18.074
No, you look like a sugar-powdered jalapeno.

25:19.195 --> 25:20.330
Okay, cool.

25:20.430 --> 25:22.966
You know what, why don't you just stalk them?

25:23.066 --> 25:27.115
How about you just stay in the shadows.

25:28.637 --> 25:30.685
Oh, my God.

25:31.974 --> 25:36.191
Hey, were you serious about
that powdered-sugar jalapeno thing?

25:36.912 --> 25:38.928
That sounds really good.

25:41.550 --> 25:43.552
What was I supposed to be doing?

25:48.327 --> 25:50.310
You have a spare phone?

25:50.860 --> 25:53.409
Yeah. Who doesn't?

25:54.930 --> 25:56.767
Time to play, guys.

25:56.867 --> 25:58.414
Yes.

26:08.978 --> 26:11.308
Oh, my God, this is so idiotic.

26:11.748 --> 26:14.084
It's obviously the force of gravity.

26:14.184 --> 26:18.967
They placed the pencils in a position
that if you barely breathe they'll move.

26:19.067 --> 26:20.373
Oh, that's right!

26:20.473 --> 26:23.560
Time dilation which we all know
is the cause of gravity...

26:23.660 --> 26:25.595
...would keep
the gravitational mass centered...

26:25.695 --> 26:28.198
...causing the friction
of the two pencils to balance out.

26:28.298 --> 26:31.334
Any minimal force, such as a breeze
or the mere breath of a subject...

26:31.434 --> 26:33.516
...could easily move the pencils.

26:35.906 --> 26:37.753
I'm just sayin'.

26:40.276 --> 26:42.113
Well, let's try it out, guys.

26:42.913 --> 26:44.781
You first, Charlie.

26:45.454 --> 26:47.718
Okay, here goes nothin'.

26:48.118 --> 26:52.756
Guys... this is exactly
how all bad horror movies start.

26:52.856 --> 26:56.126
Rational decisions to play a game that
we all know could end up going badly...

26:56.226 --> 27:00.330
- ...but we do it anyway.
- Oh, brother, please.

27:00.630 --> 27:02.177
Okay.

27:02.791 --> 27:05.847
Charlie Charlie, are you here?

27:09.472 --> 27:12.627
You know, I think I want my 20 bucks back.
This is stupid.

27:12.727 --> 27:14.611
Ask it again, man.

27:14.711 --> 27:16.746
What, you want me to ask it again, sure.

27:16.846 --> 27:20.896
Yo, Carlos Carlos, you here, man, what's up?

27:21.552 --> 27:24.788
I think he'd appreciate it
if you were more serious.

27:24.888 --> 27:27.423
I think he'd take us all more seriously.

27:27.523 --> 27:30.172
Whatever, man. Okay.

27:31.794 --> 27:33.863
Charlie Charlie...

27:33.963 --> 27:35.844
...are you here?

27:38.267 --> 27:40.082
Did you see that?

27:40.836 --> 27:42.873
Please, it's all bullshit.

27:43.373 --> 27:45.253
Shut up.

27:45.608 --> 27:47.811
Are you gonna let him talk to me like that?

27:48.311 --> 27:50.315
I think that's enough, guys.

28:30.619 --> 28:32.188
You scared, Sarah?

28:32.288 --> 28:36.705
Scared? Please, I'm bored and I want a drink.

28:40.729 --> 28:42.277
So?

28:42.698 --> 28:45.313
Well, no one was there.

28:46.001 --> 28:48.839
It was obviously that perv, Gene.

28:49.209 --> 28:52.876
- Why is he a perv?
- He was so looking down Sarah's blouse.

28:52.976 --> 28:57.147
You know, I have to admit,
the whole pencils thing is pretty impressive.

28:57.247 --> 28:58.748
Obviously it's set up, but...

28:58.848 --> 29:01.551
Maybe we should call it a night,
and head to that party.

29:01.661 --> 29:04.955
- I agree.
- Let's keep it up.

29:05.655 --> 29:09.471
Charlie Charlie, if you're here,
give us another sign.

29:26.542 --> 29:30.301
Charlie Charlie,
is it true you were a satanist?

29:33.315 --> 29:36.517
See, I knew that Gene guy was full of shit.

29:37.387 --> 29:39.322
Charlie Charlie...

29:39.422 --> 29:41.447
...have you ever killed anyone?

29:45.094 --> 29:50.180
Charlie Charlie, is it true you will hurt
one of us if we continue to play?

29:57.072 --> 30:00.210
See, guys, he's probably
just some harmless ghost.

30:00.310 --> 30:02.791
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

30:05.314 --> 30:06.895
Shit.

30:07.516 --> 30:09.364
Is he messing with us?

30:09.953 --> 30:11.787
This is cool.

30:12.466 --> 30:16.092
Look, guys, I don't think you
should be asking it anything else.

30:16.192 --> 30:18.461
I mean, this is just stupid now.

30:18.561 --> 30:21.430
Especially with that story
about the girls and everything.

30:21.530 --> 30:24.300
It just seems foolish
to keep messing with this stuff.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.603
They can keep their grand prize.

30:27.403 --> 30:30.106
Jeez, dude, get ahold of yourself.

30:30.206 --> 30:32.875
Yeah, it's just a set up.

30:32.975 --> 30:35.212
How could they make the pencils do that?

30:35.912 --> 30:39.015
They were spinning in circles.
The top one would've fallen off.

30:39.115 --> 30:41.296
It's not theoretically possible.

30:42.618 --> 30:45.288
Wow, you are such a pussy.

30:45.992 --> 30:49.225
Look, Charlie Charlie,
if you're going to hurt us...

30:49.325 --> 30:53.142
...then show us or you're gonna be
a pussy like Skeeter over here.

31:21.623 --> 31:23.526
Hey, what are you doing?

31:23.626 --> 31:27.330
Yeah, put the phone away,
you're ruining the ambiance.

31:27.430 --> 31:30.466
Like, no, I'm calling my boyfriend.

31:30.566 --> 31:32.702
You don't have a boyfriend.

31:32.802 --> 31:35.438
We literally started
going out like a second ago.

31:35.538 --> 31:38.554
He just texted me now. And I said yes.

31:43.078 --> 31:46.905
Oh, my God, there's like no service in here.

31:47.816 --> 31:49.664
This is so lame!

31:50.852 --> 31:54.757
I have to go, guys.
I'm sorry, but I have to talk to him.

31:54.857 --> 31:56.259
Fine by me.

31:56.359 --> 32:00.029
This was fun and all, but...
I think I'd rather go drink now.

32:00.621 --> 32:02.565
Finally you say it.

32:02.665 --> 32:04.467
You guys suck.

32:04.567 --> 32:06.615
Look, whatever, man.

32:18.914 --> 32:20.716
Hey, Jerry!

32:22.276 --> 32:23.765
Stanley!

32:26.955 --> 32:28.770
Is that you?

32:31.693 --> 32:33.696
Where the hell are you guys?

33:21.109 --> 33:22.991
You guys feel that?

33:23.745 --> 33:25.561
Yeah, it's cold.

33:37.526 --> 33:39.376
The hell's going on out there?

33:57.078 --> 33:59.489
So I guess this is part of it?

34:02.184 --> 34:04.266
This is pretty awesome.

34:05.487 --> 34:09.184
Okay, okay, this was fun
but let's go back now, guys.

34:31.045 --> 34:32.947
Far out.

34:33.047 --> 34:35.784
Well, we paid 20 bucks,
might as well just do it.

34:35.885 --> 34:37.934
And there's a prize at the end.

35:16.491 --> 35:18.729
Everyone stick together, all right?

35:36.078 --> 35:37.905
What the hell was that?

35:54.829 --> 35:58.815
Oh, my God, there is a weird white-faced
guy with a sombrero chasing us around...

35:58.915 --> 36:01.971
...and it's cold as hell. I wanna go home.

36:02.071 --> 36:04.724
All right, well,
what do you want me to do about it?

36:06.742 --> 36:08.289
Here.

36:33.501 --> 36:35.350
Guys, wait up!

36:48.750 --> 36:51.366
See, Gene doesn't know shit!

36:52.421 --> 36:54.837
Scared the hell out of those kids.

37:17.410 --> 37:18.946
Hello?

37:25.186 --> 37:27.723
- Oh, shit.
- Where did they go?

37:27.823 --> 37:29.704
I don't know.

37:30.592 --> 37:34.000
Pete, Gina! We're over here!

37:35.998 --> 37:37.845
The hell?

37:40.335 --> 37:41.904
Did they get ahead of us?

37:42.004 --> 37:45.020
Seriously, man, this is messed up.

37:45.774 --> 37:47.588
Come on.

38:13.368 --> 38:14.916
Paul?

38:15.403 --> 38:16.951
Stanley?

38:18.373 --> 38:21.243
You guys better not be messing with me again.

39:14.796 --> 39:17.478
No, no!

40:20.929 --> 40:22.810
Oh, it's you.

40:23.865 --> 40:25.413
Hi.

40:27.636 --> 40:29.183
Yeah.

40:30.004 --> 40:31.808
What are you doing here?

40:32.508 --> 40:37.392
Oh, God, please tell me that you didn't
let anybody see you wearing this.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.284
Oh, no.

40:41.584 --> 40:43.319
'Cause I'm a ghost, man.

40:44.019 --> 40:47.251
But I did scare the hell
out of those kids in the maze.

40:48.190 --> 40:50.671
- Really?
- Yep.

40:53.261 --> 40:56.866
Then why don't you get back out there
and keep up the good work!

40:56.966 --> 40:58.813
Good job.

40:59.668 --> 41:03.478
No, wait, I remembered what I was
gonna talk to you about. Okay.

41:03.578 --> 41:07.642
So I haven't seen and heard from Paulie.

41:07.742 --> 41:11.392
And I haven't heard and seen from Jerry.

41:12.747 --> 41:16.419
Yeah, and somebody's messing
with some of the special effects.

41:16.919 --> 41:20.524
Someone's messing
with some of the special effects?

41:21.824 --> 41:23.225
Oh, really?

41:23.325 --> 41:27.168
I told none of them to mess
with that stuff, those idiots!

41:29.497 --> 41:32.334
- Well, thanks for the information.
- Are we gonna eat after this?

41:32.434 --> 41:36.251
Because that sounds really good right now.

41:38.573 --> 41:40.121
No.

42:00.062 --> 42:02.048
Skeet, calm down, man.

42:02.698 --> 42:06.068
Calm down? This thing just shut by itself!

42:06.168 --> 42:08.571
And we don't know where Pete and Gina are.

42:08.771 --> 42:12.820
Please, man, this is all just a set up.
It's what we signed up for.

42:15.177 --> 42:17.582
Well, I don't like being closed up in here.

42:23.184 --> 42:25.032
That was fun.

42:25.320 --> 42:29.371
This game sucks, okay?
Now I can't see anything.

42:31.125 --> 42:32.962
Let's go exploring.

42:33.362 --> 42:35.231
What about everyone else?

42:36.131 --> 42:37.979
You wanna go back in there?

42:38.968 --> 42:40.514
No.

42:40.935 --> 42:43.038
Wait, no, no, no, where are we going?

42:43.138 --> 42:45.754
Come on, they'll be fine, let's go.

43:15.036 --> 43:17.172
Let's take this off course, shall we?

43:17.272 --> 43:20.922
Whatever, I'm still trying
to find service in this shithole.

43:22.710 --> 43:25.618
- Let me see your phone.
- No.

43:25.718 --> 43:28.197
Come on, I just need it for the light.

43:36.591 --> 43:38.260
What are you doing?

43:38.360 --> 43:40.546
I'm gonna see some behind-the-scenes shit.

43:40.646 --> 43:43.112
Turn the tables, try to scare these guys?

43:57.145 --> 43:59.081
Hey, buddy!

43:59.181 --> 44:01.619
Are you messing with me right now?

44:11.159 --> 44:13.407
Oh, shit!

44:15.663 --> 44:18.276
This looks so good right now.

44:28.810 --> 44:30.657
Want some?

44:32.914 --> 44:34.762
Oh, shit.

44:48.996 --> 44:50.544
No!

45:07.982 --> 45:12.354
- All right, this is a little weird.
- I told you. No one listens to me.

45:12.454 --> 45:14.302
Keep your panties on.

46:07.975 --> 46:10.211
I think it's safe to say we're lost.

46:10.439 --> 46:13.048
Don't freak out! We'll find our way back.

46:13.148 --> 46:14.916
Oh, my God!

46:15.016 --> 46:17.298
My battery's about to die!

46:27.628 --> 46:29.644
Gina, check this out.

46:42.343 --> 46:44.191
This is awesome.

47:22.483 --> 47:24.102
This is sick, man!

47:55.299 --> 47:56.847
Pete?

47:57.852 --> 47:59.400
Pete?

48:01.155 --> 48:03.003
Such an asshole!

48:06.661 --> 48:09.498
- You freakin' blew it.
- I blew it?

48:09.598 --> 48:11.300
Yeah, what is this place?

48:11.400 --> 48:13.835
It is the perfect place
where no one's gonna bother us.

48:13.935 --> 48:16.071
You couldn't even take me to the Wyndham?

48:16.171 --> 48:17.940
- Baby.
- Whatever.

48:18.040 --> 48:19.186
The Wyndham?

48:19.286 --> 48:22.945
- Anywhere besides this hole.
- This isn't a hole, honey.

48:23.045 --> 48:25.981
I don't wanna get murdered
while I'm having sex with you.

48:26.081 --> 48:27.962
But I like holes.

48:37.491 --> 48:38.927
Hello?

48:39.027 --> 48:40.829
Hey, I don't like this.

48:45.200 --> 48:46.435
Who the hell are you?

48:46.535 --> 48:48.721
Yeah, are you here
with the haunted house people?

48:54.709 --> 48:57.101
Hey, I've seen you before.

48:57.350 --> 49:00.816
- Where are the others?
- I don't know, we all got separated.

49:00.916 --> 49:05.153
And then we've been locked in this room.
Excuse me, but who are you?

49:05.253 --> 49:07.489
Yeah, what are you doing here?

49:07.589 --> 49:09.324
I heard about the challenge that you won...

49:09.424 --> 49:12.661
...about how you get to play
this game, Charlie Charlie.

49:13.161 --> 49:15.768
And how is that any of your business?

49:16.264 --> 49:19.868
I'm here so you don't play.
Have you started it yet?

49:19.968 --> 49:24.193
Yeah. We played a little while ago.
And then we left and we got lost.

49:24.293 --> 49:27.309
Oh, please, she's just all
a part of this bullshit.

49:27.409 --> 49:30.812
Look, you tell that demented perv Gene
that I want my money back.

49:30.912 --> 49:33.215
Actually, Charlie paid for your ticket.

49:33.815 --> 49:37.126
- This is stupid!
- Where are your friends?

49:37.786 --> 49:39.554
Really, we don't know.

49:39.654 --> 49:42.824
We all just started playing the game
and then we ended up here.

49:45.694 --> 49:50.344
God. What you're playing with, it's deadly.

49:53.201 --> 49:56.839
No, this is just a big prank.
It's all a set up.

49:57.339 --> 50:01.276
And you're a shitty actress.
Is this the only job that you could get?

50:01.376 --> 50:04.246
That's it! Now I remember.

50:04.346 --> 50:06.628
You're the girl from the news report.

50:09.083 --> 50:13.247
- The one that killed those girls?
- I didn't kill anyone!

50:13.888 --> 50:15.937
Those were my friends.

50:16.824 --> 50:20.481
So if you didn't kill them, who did?

50:21.029 --> 50:22.576
Him!

50:23.764 --> 50:27.669
You see? I told you we shouldn't
be messing with this stuff!

50:27.769 --> 50:32.040
Wait, hold on. So you're
telling me that some evil spirit...

50:32.140 --> 50:34.141
...killed your friends?

50:34.241 --> 50:37.925
Yeah, and if so, then why didn't it kill you?

50:39.647 --> 50:42.063
Because I finished the game.

50:44.251 --> 50:46.656
Okay, so what are we supposed to do now?

50:47.756 --> 50:49.992
Like... please, like she knows?

50:50.092 --> 50:52.940
Take me to the game, now.

51:01.669 --> 51:05.688
Hey, sorry what happened to your friends.
That must've been really hard on you.

51:14.381 --> 51:16.418
So how do you finish the game?

51:17.118 --> 51:19.000
You just ask him to stop.

51:22.389 --> 51:24.238
Is that a joke?

51:33.167 --> 51:34.715
Paulie!

51:45.946 --> 51:47.494
Paulie!

52:14.308 --> 52:16.123
That's a new trick.

52:36.231 --> 52:38.312
Sleepin' on the job.

52:38.766 --> 52:41.969
Paulie, you're supposed to be out there
making noises and stuff...

52:42.069 --> 52:44.919
...not laying down, I'm already understaffed!

52:46.640 --> 52:48.188
Paulie!

52:54.848 --> 52:56.396
Paulie!

53:15.202 --> 53:17.004
Think, Gene.

53:17.104 --> 53:18.919
Phone, phone.

53:36.691 --> 53:38.901
- <i>911, state your emergency.</i>
- Hello!

53:39.001 --> 53:41.396
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Yes, I need someone out here immediately!

53:41.496 --> 53:43.865
- <i>Okay, tell me what...</i>
- Someone's been killed!

53:43.965 --> 53:44.895
<i>What's your name?</i>

53:44.995 --> 53:48.603
My name's Gene, but everyone
calls me The Ringmaster.

53:48.703 --> 53:50.973
- Gene's fine.
- <i>Can you tell me where you are right now?</i>

53:51.073 --> 53:54.876
Yes, it's Hangman's House Of Horror,
666 Red Mountain Lane!

53:54.976 --> 53:57.461
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello?

54:21.068 --> 54:24.729
- Daddy.
- Come to Daddy.

54:27.975 --> 54:32.994
<i>Sheriff Anderson? We have a possible
homicide at 666 Red Mountain Lane.</i>

54:36.483 --> 54:39.132
Yeah, yeah, unit 42.

54:39.753 --> 54:41.601
1076.

54:42.122 --> 54:43.970
1076.

54:56.370 --> 54:57.939
Guys!

54:58.039 --> 55:01.242
- Shit!
- Charlie.

55:01.342 --> 55:04.824
- Sarah!
- Charlie.

55:05.879 --> 55:07.895
Come in here.

55:15.622 --> 55:17.792
Oh, shit, hey.

55:17.892 --> 55:19.907
What took you so long?

55:23.631 --> 55:27.068
No, wait, wait, wait. Babe, come on,
stop, this is serious, all right?

55:27.168 --> 55:29.571
- We need to get out of here.
- Oh, please.

55:29.671 --> 55:32.107
The only thing scary in this place is Ryder.

55:32.707 --> 55:34.555
Murderess psycho.

55:35.009 --> 55:37.279
And I saw the way she was looking at you.

55:37.779 --> 55:41.483
Come on, she's just trying to help us out.
You don't gotta be so mean.

55:41.583 --> 55:44.654
- What's your problem?
- What is that supposed to mean?

55:45.954 --> 55:48.256
- You like her, don't you?
- Oh, my God, here we go.

55:48.356 --> 55:50.592
You know what, I'm out of here.
I don't need this shit, bye.

55:50.692 --> 55:53.095
Oh, yeah, now you don't wanna talk.

55:53.595 --> 55:56.865
I swear if that girl
comes anywhere near me...

55:56.965 --> 55:59.789
...I'll show her what possessed
really looks like!

56:01.903 --> 56:03.450
Charlie!

56:04.204 --> 56:08.680
Charlie, hold on, babe!
My feet hurt in these heels when I run!

56:10.178 --> 56:14.449
Like I said, I have X
in my purse and you blew it.

56:14.549 --> 56:18.053
You know what,
I've got rubbers in my wallet...

56:18.153 --> 56:19.921
- ...that have expired!
- Rubbers?

56:20.021 --> 56:22.223
They have expired!

56:22.323 --> 56:25.593
- You think this is funny?
- Yeah, I bet your wife doesn't like that.

56:25.693 --> 56:28.663
- I haven't had sex in three years!
- I believe it!

56:28.763 --> 56:32.840
If you're gonna pull this crap.
Bring me to a place like this?

56:34.118 --> 56:37.164
Lost in a spooky haunted house...

56:37.264 --> 56:40.711
...and can't see a thing.

56:42.176 --> 56:43.823
Hashtag...

56:44.778 --> 56:46.626
...blind intuition.

56:51.053 --> 56:53.214
'Bout time you text me back, Bill.

56:56.557 --> 56:58.572
You horndog, okay.

57:08.403 --> 57:10.250
Oh, my God.

57:10.971 --> 57:13.053
I look so fat.

57:14.942 --> 57:17.198
There is no way I'm sending that.

57:40.801 --> 57:43.417
Okay, not fun anymore.

57:53.380 --> 57:55.229
We need to run.

58:00.220 --> 58:02.090
I can't see it.

58:02.190 --> 58:04.792
I mean, I know it's there, but...

58:04.892 --> 58:06.473
Run!

58:25.078 --> 58:27.728
I don't see it anymore,
do you think we lost it?

58:30.184 --> 58:33.321
- We need to find the game.
- Where do we go?

58:33.421 --> 58:35.490
You mean you don't know where it is?

58:35.590 --> 58:39.263
We've never been here before.
We're just as lost as you.

58:42.896 --> 58:45.148
We need to find it, let's go!

59:20.033 --> 59:21.882
He's messing with us.

59:30.961 --> 59:32.740
Shit, run!

59:40.020 --> 59:41.735
Hey, wait up!

59:44.008 --> 59:46.022
Sarah, come on!

59:48.929 --> 59:51.379
Guys, hurry up, come on!

59:53.400 --> 59:55.281
Stay close!

01:00:04.711 --> 01:00:06.259
Charlie!

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.628
Oh, God.

01:00:10.884 --> 01:00:13.367
Charlie, can you not leave me?

01:00:34.452 --> 01:00:35.962
Sarah!

01:00:37.411 --> 01:00:39.626
Charlie... oh, God!

01:00:44.051 --> 01:00:45.866
We gotta go.

01:00:50.424 --> 01:00:52.272
No, no!

01:00:58.265 --> 01:00:59.813
Stanley!

01:01:01.168 --> 01:01:04.192
Jerry! Just so you know...

01:01:04.292 --> 01:01:06.386
...I found Paulie, he's dead!

01:01:10.243 --> 01:01:12.091
Oh, no.

01:01:14.281 --> 01:01:16.296
This game is over.

01:01:36.303 --> 01:01:40.108
Where are we going? The classroom's on
the first floor, we just keep going up.

01:01:40.208 --> 01:01:43.612
You got a better idea?
You wanna go back that way?

01:01:44.112 --> 01:01:45.992
Then let's go!

01:01:54.788 --> 01:01:56.601
What's wrong?

01:01:56.701 --> 01:02:00.333
- What's wrong with him?
- He has a little fear of heights.

01:02:01.262 --> 01:02:03.697
Skeeter, you all right, dude?

01:02:04.397 --> 01:02:06.868
Yeah. Yeah.

01:02:07.068 --> 01:02:09.549
- All right, come on.
- Okay.

01:02:17.677 --> 01:02:19.025
Yeah.

01:02:21.007 --> 01:02:23.254
We need to find the game.
We have to finish it.

01:02:23.354 --> 01:02:26.087
Yeah, let's go. Skeeter, come on, buddy.

01:02:26.187 --> 01:02:29.215
We gotta get out of here, all right?
Come on. Let's do this.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.772
Daddy.

01:02:35.459 --> 01:02:37.057
Stanley?

01:02:38.498 --> 01:02:40.046
Hello?

01:02:43.737 --> 01:02:46.408
All right, I just felt something
on my shoulder.

01:02:47.508 --> 01:02:50.178
- I think I'm going crazy.
- Daddy.

01:02:50.578 --> 01:02:54.415
Of course I'm going crazy.
Hey, we need some publicity!

01:02:54.515 --> 01:02:57.105
You know what, why don't we
invite a bunch of teenage kids...

01:02:57.205 --> 01:03:00.121
...to come into the haunted house
and run around wild all night long?

01:03:00.221 --> 01:03:02.624
Yeah, that'll draw some attention!

01:03:03.024 --> 01:03:06.360
Stupid. Like that's ever
gonna get me any money.

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.111
I'll never be able to pay these people back.

01:03:20.658 --> 01:03:22.205
No!

01:03:26.013 --> 01:03:27.827
It's stuck!

01:03:29.909 --> 01:03:31.519
It's not gonna be that easy.

01:03:31.619 --> 01:03:35.475
He's gonna kill you before he lets you
leave without finishing the game.

01:03:36.524 --> 01:03:38.539
Oh, how would you know?

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:46.882
Hey, I'm so sorry,
I completely forgot about your incident.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.987
Incident.

01:03:55.609 --> 01:03:57.824
Wasn't an incident!

01:03:58.345 --> 01:04:00.390
It was a massacre!

01:04:01.948 --> 01:04:06.721
My two best friends were tortured and killed
by this seemingly-innocent game!

01:04:06.821 --> 01:04:09.471
And I couldn't do a damn thing about it!

01:04:11.725 --> 01:04:16.430
They said I was crazy. That I had
to be killed for what I had done!

01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:21.102
But I didn't care, because I knew
the truth, I knew what happened!

01:04:21.202 --> 01:04:24.344
And I promised myself that I would
dedicate the rest of my life...

01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:27.654
...to making sure that this
never happened ever again!

01:04:46.891 --> 01:04:48.408
Stanley?

01:04:52.165 --> 01:04:54.769
- Daddy.
- Right.

01:04:55.269 --> 01:04:57.922
Stanley, I don't know
how you just did that...

01:04:59.173 --> 01:05:02.789
...but I'm telling you,
you scared me for once.

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:06.359
All right?

01:05:06.613 --> 01:05:08.302
Daddy!

01:05:11.752 --> 01:05:13.600
Or is that you, Jerry?

01:05:15.054 --> 01:05:16.895
Either way...

01:05:18.192 --> 01:05:22.463
...I'm really scared right now, guys,
so you got me, all right? I said it!

01:05:22.563 --> 01:05:24.444
Are you happy?

01:05:27.634 --> 01:05:29.449
Just so you know...

01:05:30.703 --> 01:05:34.509
...I think one of those kids has lost
his mind and they killed Paulie!

01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:37.645
I'm tellin' you, I found his body
in the meat locker room!

01:05:37.745 --> 01:05:41.361
He's dead, I tell ya, D-E-D, dead!

01:05:44.518 --> 01:05:47.121
Don't worry, the sheriff
should be here any moment...

01:05:47.221 --> 01:05:51.324
...so stop whatever it is that you're doing,
trying to scare people and everything...

01:05:51.424 --> 01:05:54.699
...and go ahead and come on out.

01:05:59.165 --> 01:06:02.382
Guys? Knock it off, come on out!

01:06:05.905 --> 01:06:07.353
All right.

01:06:07.907 --> 01:06:09.789
Then just stay here!

01:06:10.877 --> 01:06:14.516
Yeah, go ahead and stay here,
stay here and die, see if I care!

01:06:15.716 --> 01:06:18.200
One less person I have to pay back.

01:06:20.587 --> 01:06:22.436
I'm leaving!

01:06:45.713 --> 01:06:47.368
Daddy.

01:07:00.026 --> 01:07:02.396
Oh, my God, Gene, are you okay?

01:07:02.496 --> 01:07:04.920
You stay back! You stay back.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.314
Don't come any closer,
you sick sons of bitches!

01:07:09.369 --> 01:07:11.205
You all did this!

01:07:11.305 --> 01:07:14.809
- Now all my actors are dead!
- What actors?

01:07:14.909 --> 01:07:17.468
Told you, man, they were trying to scare us.

01:07:17.568 --> 01:07:19.512
They were...

01:07:19.612 --> 01:07:22.061
...until you killed 'em!

01:07:23.616 --> 01:07:26.087
Look, Gene, we didn't do anything.

01:07:26.487 --> 01:07:28.189
It's Charlie.

01:07:28.289 --> 01:07:31.325
Charlie Charlie, not Charlie.

01:07:31.425 --> 01:07:37.006
I don't care how many times you say
his name, you're gonna fry for this, pal!

01:07:37.297 --> 01:07:41.977
And you, I don't recall
inviting you to this little fiesta!

01:07:43.436 --> 01:07:46.140
- I'm Ryder.
- No, it's okay.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.541
She's played the game before.

01:07:47.641 --> 01:07:51.071
She's been all over the news for all
those grisly Charlie Charlie murders.

01:07:52.446 --> 01:07:54.214
No, no, no!

01:07:55.482 --> 01:07:57.130
Help!

01:07:58.351 --> 01:08:00.866
Help, I'm in here!

01:08:02.522 --> 01:08:03.774
I don't wanna get murdered...

01:08:03.874 --> 01:08:06.088
- ...while I'm having sex.
- I gotta finish!

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.700
Oh, please! Start the car!

01:08:19.037 --> 01:08:21.908
- You're worthless!
- You are worthless.

01:08:22.009 --> 01:08:24.917
Oh, what was I thinking? Oh, my God.

01:08:25.411 --> 01:08:27.682
- I'm gonna get blue balls!
- Fine!

01:08:27.782 --> 01:08:31.185
- I have blue balls right now!
- Your little penis.

01:08:31.285 --> 01:08:33.906
My little penis and my giant blue balls!

01:08:34.921 --> 01:08:37.871
Don't go, I'm still in here!

01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:40.260
Don't go!

01:08:41.861 --> 01:08:45.310
- You blew it!
- I blew it? You didn't blow me!

01:08:47.767 --> 01:08:49.615
No, don't go!

01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:52.006
Don't go!

01:08:52.106 --> 01:08:55.188
Don't leave me in here with these lunatics!

01:09:00.446 --> 01:09:04.529
You stay back. You stay back, you savages.

01:09:05.518 --> 01:09:09.002
Look, we need to find the pencils
so we can finish the game.

01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:19.712
- You mean these?
- Yes!

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.904
Hey! What did you do that for?

01:09:24.004 --> 01:09:26.359
You have no idea what you've just done!

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:28.675
Oh, yes, I do.

01:09:28.774 --> 01:09:32.658
I just stopped you all from playing
your evil little game.

01:09:33.613 --> 01:09:38.430
Because I refuse to join your
pencil-worshiping murder cult!

01:09:39.752 --> 01:09:42.956
And now there are dead bodies
all over my haunted house!

01:09:59.439 --> 01:10:01.287
Elevator shaft.

01:10:19.459 --> 01:10:22.070
I'll go out the fire escape exit on the roof!

01:10:32.872 --> 01:10:34.420
Jerry?

01:10:34.941 --> 01:10:36.635
Is that you?

01:10:37.644 --> 01:10:39.499
Are you bleeding?

01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:45.698
Daddy.

01:11:05.972 --> 01:11:08.007
Smells like weed.

01:11:09.842 --> 01:11:11.490
Stanley?

01:11:20.219 --> 01:11:22.379
What happened to your neck?

01:11:22.479 --> 01:11:25.772
Oh, man, I'm so dead right now!

01:11:34.734 --> 01:11:37.035
Are you guys here to kill me?

01:11:38.474 --> 01:11:40.287
Oh, no.

01:11:44.844 --> 01:11:46.689
He probably will, though.

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:50.329
Paulie?

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:52.952
Paulie.

01:11:53.052 --> 01:11:54.934
Where's our money?

01:11:55.638 --> 01:11:57.336
Oh, no!

01:12:06.766 --> 01:12:09.103
Do you know our chances
of finding those pencils?

01:12:09.203 --> 01:12:12.038
Of course I do, man,
but we have to find them!

01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:16.877
Change of plans. We're gonna get
the hell out of here before he kills us too.

01:12:16.977 --> 01:12:19.252
Gene's hearse is parked outside.

01:12:25.885 --> 01:12:27.733
Let's go!

01:12:58.367 --> 01:12:59.727
Charlie?

01:13:00.587 --> 01:13:03.069
How could you just leave me?

01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:06.138
You're alive?

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:10.276
Does it look like I'm alive?

01:13:13.399 --> 01:13:14.947
Yes?

01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:20.019
I've gotta get him.

01:13:30.583 --> 01:13:32.465
I found her.

01:13:32.985 --> 01:13:35.188
There you are.

01:13:35.288 --> 01:13:39.906
- We've been looking everywhere for you.
- You gave us quite a scare.

01:13:40.907 --> 01:13:44.574
I wanted to spend the rest
of my life with you, Charlie.

01:13:45.699 --> 01:13:47.900
You meant everything to me.

01:13:49.268 --> 01:13:51.953
How could you just leave me like that?

01:13:53.173 --> 01:13:55.998
So what's the verdict, doc?

01:13:58.533 --> 01:14:01.390
Well, the test results show that...

01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:06.286
...her violent behaviors are brought on
by dissociative identity disorder.

01:14:06.386 --> 01:14:08.622
Multiple personalities.

01:14:08.722 --> 01:14:12.626
- Well, I could've told you that.
- Well, why didn't you?

01:14:12.726 --> 01:14:17.543
This is probably why it all happened,
you killed me, Charlie!

01:14:18.965 --> 01:14:21.013
Sarah, please.

01:14:21.817 --> 01:14:23.654
I didn't mean to.

01:14:24.004 --> 01:14:25.806
I didn't want you to die.

01:14:26.306 --> 01:14:30.277
Anyway, one or several
of the personalities...

01:14:30.377 --> 01:14:33.292
...have a marked lack of empathy.

01:14:33.946 --> 01:14:35.795
True sociopath.

01:14:36.949 --> 01:14:40.375
So that's how you got away
with those murders, wasn't it?

01:14:42.556 --> 01:14:43.957
Take my hand.

01:14:44.057 --> 01:14:47.494
What about Skeeter? What about Ryder?

01:14:47.594 --> 01:14:51.410
Bring them along, we have room for more.

01:14:56.002 --> 01:14:59.003
Hey, what are you doing? Come on!

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:08.153
You actually believed you were innocent.

01:15:09.248 --> 01:15:12.386
This one is not for the outside world.

01:15:12.486 --> 01:15:14.567
What do we do with her?

01:15:16.890 --> 01:15:18.722
Put her with the others.

01:15:19.893 --> 01:15:21.407
Ryder!

01:15:22.528 --> 01:15:24.732
It's all right, he's just trying to scare us!

01:15:25.332 --> 01:15:26.700
We need to go!

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.011
- Let's go.
- Now!

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.488
Come on!

01:15:46.485 --> 01:15:48.728
Does anyone wanna switch seats?

01:15:48.956 --> 01:15:51.443
Come on, Ryder, drive!

01:15:52.091 --> 01:15:53.972
What's wrong?

01:15:54.862 --> 01:15:56.830
- What happened?
- No!

01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:58.745
What's going on?

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:04.517
- It's the parking break!
- It's released!

01:16:08.307 --> 01:16:10.123
Leave us alone!

01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:14.560
- Screw this, let's get out of here!
- It's gonna blow!

01:16:23.089 --> 01:16:25.311
You guys, let's go!

01:16:27.143 --> 01:16:29.759
- Dude, where did she go?
- I don't know!

01:16:33.566 --> 01:16:34.635
- Charlie!
- What?

01:16:34.735 --> 01:16:37.170
- I found the pencils!
- Awesome, dude!

01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:39.920
- We can finish the game!
- You guys!

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:42.963
- Ryder, look, we found the pencils!
- Thank God.

01:16:47.146 --> 01:16:49.616
Dude, we gotta go and save her, man.

01:16:49.716 --> 01:16:52.344
- Dude, come on, come on!
- Okay.

01:16:55.021 --> 01:16:56.589
Which way?

01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:58.571
I don't know.

01:17:04.329 --> 01:17:06.144
This way.

01:17:26.619 --> 01:17:29.702
- This isn't possible.
- I know.

01:17:30.156 --> 01:17:32.559
This is completely ridiculous, man.

01:17:32.659 --> 01:17:36.663
- I feel like we're walking around in circles.
- We're never gonna find her.

01:17:36.763 --> 01:17:39.719
We'll find her, man, we'll find her.
We just gotta get the hell out of here...

01:17:39.819 --> 01:17:42.316
...so we can finish
this damn game already, dude.

01:17:50.276 --> 01:17:51.824
Charlie?

01:18:16.001 --> 01:18:17.549
Skeeter?

01:18:18.704 --> 01:18:20.206
Skeeter!

01:18:20.306 --> 01:18:22.188
Where'd you go, man?

01:18:28.114 --> 01:18:29.702
Charlie?

01:18:30.517 --> 01:18:33.120
Ryder. What are you doing?
We gotta get out of here.

01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:35.100
Hey, Charlie.

01:18:43.379 --> 01:18:45.215
What's wrong, Charlie?

01:18:45.765 --> 01:18:48.602
What's wrong? All my friends are dead!

01:18:49.302 --> 01:18:51.584
All because of this stupid game!

01:18:55.274 --> 01:18:57.127
And I couldn't do anything.

01:18:57.627 --> 01:18:59.679
I couldn't save any of them.

01:19:01.347 --> 01:19:04.584
It's okay, you did your best.

01:19:04.684 --> 01:19:08.889
But let's be honest.
Your friends were stupid anyways.

01:19:08.989 --> 01:19:12.292
If you asked me,
I think they deserved to die.

01:19:12.392 --> 01:19:13.927
What?

01:19:14.027 --> 01:19:15.875
Why would you say that?

01:19:16.823 --> 01:19:18.468
Charlie?

01:19:19.365 --> 01:19:21.247
Who were you talking to?

01:19:34.281 --> 01:19:36.928
No, please, no!

01:19:56.502 --> 01:19:59.730
Charlie Charlie,
can we please finish the game?

01:20:15.154 --> 01:20:17.824
Ryder. Ryder.

01:20:17.924 --> 01:20:19.471
Hey.

01:20:21.694 --> 01:20:23.296
You okay?

01:20:23.396 --> 01:20:26.015
Oh, yeah, I been better though.

01:20:27.767 --> 01:20:29.581
It's over.

01:20:31.804 --> 01:20:34.854
- We did it.
- We did.

01:20:53.042 --> 01:20:54.870
<i>Sheriff Anderson?</i>

01:20:56.670 --> 01:20:58.932
<i>Sheriff Anderson,
I just got back from my break...</i>

01:20:59.032 --> 01:21:01.902
<i>...did you respond
to the possible homicide call?</i>

01:21:02.502 --> 01:21:05.505
Yeah, Sheriff Anderson,
you got him, go ahead.

01:21:05.705 --> 01:21:09.910
<i>Did you respond to the possible
homicide at 666 Red Mountain Lane?</i>

01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:12.676
Yeah, 10-4, I'm on my way.

01:21:27.092 --> 01:21:28.640
Hello?

01:21:29.628 --> 01:21:32.698
Okay, this is totally
not funny anymore, guys.

01:21:34.768 --> 01:21:36.315
Sarah?

01:21:37.636 --> 01:21:39.184
Scooter?

01:21:40.739 --> 01:21:42.321
Charlie?

01:21:43.210 --> 01:21:45.258
Charlie, are you here?

01:24:41.119 --> 01:24:44.336
Okay. I'm okay, yeah.

01:24:44.690 --> 01:24:48.507
I'm alive, are you kidding me? I'm alive.
