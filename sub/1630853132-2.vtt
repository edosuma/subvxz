Previously on
<i>"The Girl from Plainville"...</i>

00:03.795 --> 00:04.838
You called in
a missing person?

00:04.838 --> 00:06.715
Name's Conrad Roy III.

00:06.715 --> 00:09.968
<i>What's your son driving?</i>
Ford F250, black.

00:09.968 --> 00:13.055
- There's yellow tape
around our son's truck.

00:13.055 --> 00:14.431
Michelle, what is it?

00:14.431 --> 00:15.724
- Conrad's dead.

00:15.724 --> 00:16.934
- Who's Conrad?

00:16.934 --> 00:18.727

<i>Michelle Carter. Know her?</i>

00:18.727 --> 00:19.895
<i>Not really.</i>

00:19.895 --> 00:21.146
- They were dating?

00:21.146 --> 00:22.981
- They only met up, like,
once or twice.

00:22.981 --> 00:24.566
- Florida?
That's where you guys met?

00:24.566 --> 00:28.987
I remember that trip.
He came back happy.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.530
He left you a note, sweetheart.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.116
- He did?
Well, can I read it?

00:33.116 --> 00:35.327
- I was thinking of putting
something together for Coco,

00:35.327 --> 00:36.870
for, like, mental health
or something.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.747
- I would be honored.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.719
Dinner is at 5:00 sharp
every night,

01:33.719 --> 01:35.554
and don't be late,
or you'll be eating crumbs.

01:35.554 --> 01:36.597
- Okay.
- Come on!

01:38.140 --> 01:40.309
Coco, come on, help me.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.187
Bags aren't gonna grow legs.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.689
Move it.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.525
Getting really
good grades,

02:30.525 --> 02:31.943
doing really, really well.
They're both doing great.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.195
- Yeah, but no,
she's bad at it.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.488
- All right.
- Shut up.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.614
- What?
You suck.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.449
- Sydney!
- Hey, he does too.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.077
- All right, that's enough.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.870
Math wasn't my thing
either.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.749
- Hey, put it down.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.961
There's a new girlfriend.
She's from...

02:51.755 --> 02:53.048
- Ohio.
- Ohio.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.508
- How nice.
Is she pretty?

02:54.508 --> 02:56.093
- We don't know.
They met on the computer.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.302
- Dad.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.553
- Hey, listen, by the way,
your mom says

02:58.553 --> 02:59.930
you can't go visit her.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.264
- What?

03:01.264 --> 03:03.183
- Yeah, Coco, her dad
doesn't even know you.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.434
- Mom said
she would talk to him.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.145
- And she did talk to him,
and he said no.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.857
You've got a problem with it,
talk to your mom, all right?

03:10.857 --> 03:12.818
I'm just the messenger
this time.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.366
- Is baseball good?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.702
- It's off-season,
so it's in the spring.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.079
- How do you like
your new school?

03:24.079 --> 03:25.247
- He dropped out.
- What?

03:25.247 --> 03:26.790
- Oh, my gosh.
- You dropped out?

03:26.790 --> 03:28.291
- Will you put something
in your mouth?

03:28.291 --> 03:32.295
- I--I didn't drop out.
I'm just doing online classes.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.673
- Yeah, he does everything from
the computer right from home.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.133
So it's still school.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.968
I just don't have to deal
with stupid people.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.261
- That's nice.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.887
- And I've been taking him
to work with me too.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.722
Yeah, he's doing great.
We go out, you know,

03:42.722 --> 03:45.225
three weeks out,
a couple days in.

03:45.225 --> 03:49.104
- Is this the famous Roy clan?
- Indeed, it is.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.939
- All she does
is gush about you.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.607
Ruth lives a few houses down.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.526
This is my nephew, Conrad Jr.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.236
- Hi, call me Co.

03:56.987 --> 04:00.157
Your tugboat towed Sully
in off the Hudson.

04:00.157 --> 04:03.285
- Oh, that was just, you know,
right place, right time.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.662
And this is
his beautiful wife, Carolyn.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.122
- She's--
- Actually, we're not--

04:07.122 --> 04:10.459
- And these are the kids,
Paige and Sydney and Coco,

04:10.459 --> 04:12.836
who is quite
the baseball player.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.088
My granddaughter
plays softball.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.423
Oh.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.925
- He's also working
in the family business.

04:18.925 --> 04:22.220
- Such a beautiful
and talented family.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.264
Right to be proud.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.600
- Nice to meet you.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.437
She's nice.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.688
You guys are lucky.

04:31.688 --> 04:35.525
I mean, this food
is incredible.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.024
Hey, it's Lily.
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

05:16.024 --> 05:17.818
- Are you ghosting me?

05:18.902 --> 05:20.403
I don't care
what your dad thinks.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.197
Call me back.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.169
Hey, it's Lily,
<i>leave me a message.</i>

05:39.589 --> 05:44.427
- I'm sorry.
I'm just pissed off...

05:44.427 --> 05:47.806
not at you.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.015
Just call me, please.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.152
Coco.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.571
Come here.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.792
This is my granddaughter,
Michelle.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.211
Michelle, this is Coco.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.255
- Conrad.
- What?

06:21.631 --> 06:23.925
- Conrad Henri Roy III.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.220
This is the young man
I was telling you about.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.055
Lives in Mattapoisett.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.892
- Hi.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.144
Michelle lives
in Plainville.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.395
What are the chances?

06:36.855 --> 06:38.189
- Cool.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.358
She's here
for a couple more days.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.819
Thought you two could hang.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.530
I'm gonna go wrangle the gear.
Be right back.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.413
- Grandma.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.376
Where's Mattapoisett?

06:59.544 --> 07:01.171
- South Coast.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.841
- I've heard stuff about it.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.509
- Stuff?

07:07.135 --> 07:08.970
- That's it's rough.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.848
- Hmm.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.689
I gotta go.

07:19.689 --> 07:20.899
Hey.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.692

<i>This is Lily's dad.</i>

07:22.692 --> 07:24.986
<i>I thought I was very clear</i>
<i>with your mom.</i>

07:27.030 --> 07:28.365
- Can I just please--

07:28.365 --> 07:30.283
Stop calling
<i>or we'll have a problem.</i>

07:48.802 --> 07:50.345
- What do you think?

07:50.345 --> 07:53.348
- They're just texts,
a lot of goddamn texts.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.059
- Due respect,
those are fucked-up texts.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.522
- Was there
a missing person's report?

08:00.522 --> 08:01.564
- Yeah.
Put out a BOLO

08:01.564 --> 08:03.608
even though it was just
12 hours.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.027
Did he deal
with depression at all?

08:06.027 --> 08:07.237
- Yeah.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.781
Was this
his first suicide attempt?

08:09.781 --> 08:11.241
- No.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.035
So how's this girl
responsible this time?

08:15.245 --> 08:20.917
- Look, her texts to him get
even more insistent

08:20.917 --> 08:22.377
in the final 24 hours.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.671
And according to the records,
they spoke on the phone

08:24.671 --> 08:26.965
for 42 minutes before he died.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.383
Last person to talk to him.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.927
- Her statement?

08:30.927 --> 08:32.512
- Haven't gotten one yet.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.306
- So what do you want?

08:35.306 --> 08:37.517
- A warrant for her phone.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.273
Okay, look.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.780
She says,
"You keep pushing it off,

08:50.780 --> 08:52.449
"and you say you'll do it,
but you never do.

08:52.449 --> 08:56.619
"It's always gonna be that way
if you don't take action.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.539
"You're just making it harder
on yourself by pushing it off.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.833
You just have to do it."

09:04.753 --> 09:08.089
- Bring me something that can
prove intent, contradiction,

09:08.089 --> 09:10.717
even a cover-up,
and we'll talk.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.385
You haven't got it yet.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.235
Cass, I saw your Insta.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.070
You went
to the Keith Urban concert?

10:12.070 --> 10:14.364
- Yeah, it was amazing.
- It was so fun.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.698
We were, like, five rows back--

10:15.698 --> 10:18.660
- So it's my birthday
this weekend.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.496
I was thinking we could go
maybe into Boston,

10:21.496 --> 10:24.332
do dinner.
It could be really fun.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.959
Maybe we could get
matching tattoos.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.044
I'll be 18,
so I could get one.

10:28.044 --> 10:31.589
- Yeah.
Um, that sounds so fun,

10:31.589 --> 10:33.675
uh, but I think
I'm working that night.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.635
Yeah, I have to check
with my parents.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.220
- Mm-hmm. Same.

10:38.429 --> 10:39.597
- Sure.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.019
I was thinking
we could've talked

10:45.019 --> 10:48.148
about the fundraiser.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.316
I'm gonna call it
"Homers for Conrad."

10:51.025 --> 10:52.610
You guys said
that you would help me,

10:52.610 --> 10:54.404
but if you're too busy,
it's totally fine.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.448
I--I can plan it on my own.
It's not really a big deal.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.701
- That's what you want to do
for your birthday?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.705
- Yeah.
Is that weird?

11:03.705 --> 11:08.168
- No, no, it's just,
you should be celebrating.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.798
- I just really want
to get it right for Conrad.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.802
Sometimes I feel
like he's here with me.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.471
I don't want to let him down.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.768
- You know what?

11:25.768 --> 11:29.314
I could probably get someone
to cover my shift, right?

11:29.314 --> 11:31.232
Yeah, oh yeah,
for sure.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.068
- Thanks.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.184
- Hi.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.769
Sorry, I didn't--

12:49.769 --> 12:52.105
- It's okay.
Just wasn't expecting anyone.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.275
Conrad, right?

12:57.568 --> 12:58.820
- Sorry, you are, um...

12:58.820 --> 13:00.863
- Michelle.
- Right, right.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.616
See you later.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.451
- Oh, okay, cool.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.293
- I know a trick
that helps me sleep.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.671
- Works great.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.468
- I could teach it to you
if you want.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.388
- Sure.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.767
- Turtle.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.437
- What?

13:32.437 --> 13:33.896
You have to say
the first thing

13:33.896 --> 13:34.939
that pops into your head.
- Oh.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.232
- It's a word game.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.483
Eventually,
your brain just drifts,

13:37.483 --> 13:39.444
trying to think
of a random word.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.904
- So basically, you're
boring yourself to sleep.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.785
- Turtle.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.497
- Ninja.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.666
- Ninja turtles?
Really?

13:53.666 --> 13:56.586
- It's the first thing
that came to my mind.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.964
What would you have said?

13:59.964 --> 14:02.008
- Like, pizza.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.844
- Dude, that--
that is ninja turtles.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.557
Okay, bread.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.476
- Cheese.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.311
- Mouse.

14:13.311 --> 14:16.439
- Ratatouille.
- Chef.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.857
- Ratatouille.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.026
- No, you can't say
the same word.

14:20.026 --> 14:23.154
- So many rules.
Um...

14:23.154 --> 14:24.530
Disney.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.658
- Princess.

14:28.743 --> 14:29.827
- Prince.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.415
- Romance.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.003
- Kiss.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.759
- Girl.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.138
- Pretty.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.102
Ten, nine...

17:51.404 --> 17:52.613
- How you holding up?

17:54.407 --> 17:57.535
- People ask me that like
there's gonna be a good answer.

17:58.202 --> 18:01.038
- I guess maybe people
don't know what to say.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.708
- You can say nothing.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.921
- Yeah.
Um, okay.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.592
Uh, look, I--I just have,
um, a--a couple questions

18:12.592 --> 18:14.385
to close the case.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.596
Um, just routine.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.724
Did your son have, um,
a computer?

18:19.724 --> 18:22.768
- Yeah.
It's at his dad's.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.520
- Can I get it?

18:24.520 --> 18:28.149
It would be helpful,
tie up some loose ends.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.568
Like I said, it's--it's just
something we do.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.403
- Are your loose ends
gonna tell me

18:32.403 --> 18:33.863
why what happened happened?

18:39.785 --> 18:44.665
- Do you have--do you have
any sense, any--any idea?

18:44.665 --> 18:46.292
- I mean, how many kids
you know spend a day

18:46.292 --> 18:48.711
on the beach with their moms
and then go kill themselves?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.926
Mine did.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.685
I--I gotta swing by there
to drop the girls off.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.646
I can--I can get the laptop.

19:07.355 --> 19:08.356
Um, okay.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.649
I, um--I don't want to cause

19:09.649 --> 19:11.942
any, you know, strife.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.195
- It's all fucking strife.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.446
- Better for me to go?

19:15.446 --> 19:17.448
- A cop
showing up unannounced?

19:18.616 --> 19:19.992
Definitely not better.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.789
Okay, well,
the brisket looks good.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.290
It looks amazing.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.458
Oh, look.

19:27.458 --> 19:28.417
Did you bring me my beers?

19:28.417 --> 19:29.627
Yes.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.054
Here they are.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.305
- Hi, Grandma.
- Hi.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.891
Hey.
Come here, you guys.

19:43.891 --> 19:47.103
Ah!
Sydney.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.355
Hi.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.191
Uh, you better be hungry.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.442
Grab a plate.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.860
- Yeah, what about you, Lynn?
You hungry?

19:54.860 --> 19:56.195
- I'm not staying.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.780
- Conrad, get her a plate.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.407
- She said she ain't staying.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.534
- Well, look at her.
She needs to eat.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.285
- Well, we'll have to do
some rationing.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.037
I didn't plan
for an extra body.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.414
Look, it's fine.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.040
I'd hate
for y'all to go hungry.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.377
- See?
It all works out.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.670
- Hey.

20:12.670 --> 20:13.671
Hey.

20:13.671 --> 20:16.006
- How you doing?

20:16.006 --> 20:18.300
You saw they brought
Coco's truck back?

20:18.300 --> 20:19.677
- Yeah.
Can I--

20:19.677 --> 20:23.305
- They also brought that, um--
that water pump too.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.516
I didn't know
what to do with it.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.101
I put it in the garage.
It's like--

20:27.101 --> 20:28.477
- Can we not talk
about that now?

20:28.477 --> 20:29.770
- Yeah.
Sorry.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.231
- Look, I--I need
your house key.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.941
How come?

20:33.941 --> 20:36.026
- The detective wants
Coco's laptop,

20:36.026 --> 20:39.655
something about closing up
the investigation.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.615
- Why didn't he just call me?

20:41.615 --> 20:43.075
- Well, you can call
and ask him,

20:43.075 --> 20:45.035
or you can just give me
the key.

20:45.035 --> 20:46.662
- Don't you think
that's a little weird?

20:46.662 --> 20:47.955
- No, I don't.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.374
Come on, Lynn.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.168
I can't just give you
my house key.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.627
- It'll take two minutes.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.297
- Put yourself in my shoes.
- In your shoes?

20:56.297 --> 20:57.882
You're in my house
all the goddamn time.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.383
- Not by myself, I'm not
in your house all the time.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.551
- Jesus Christ,
what, do you think

21:00.551 --> 21:01.635
I'm gonna snoop around?
- All right.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.179
Keep it down.
Just calm down.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.472
- I divorced you.
- Co, Co,

21:04.472 --> 21:05.806
just get her the keys.

21:05.806 --> 21:06.974
Have you guys seen this?

21:07.558 --> 21:10.352
Michelle's hosting
a baseball tournament for Coco.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.229
Michelle?
Who's Michelle?

21:12.938 --> 21:15.232
- Coco's friend
from Plainville, that girl.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.401
- Oh, right.
- I think it's weird.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.653
She's just trying to do
something nice for Coco

21:19.653 --> 21:20.905
and for us.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.073
- So what?
Are you gonna go to this?

21:23.073 --> 21:25.868
- What, you're not?
- I don't know.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.912
Dad, you want to go?

21:28.579 --> 21:29.872
Huh?

21:29.872 --> 21:31.373
They're having
a baseball tournament

21:31.373 --> 21:32.833
in Plainville for Coco.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.210
- Plainville?

21:34.210 --> 21:35.836
- Yeah, Coco's friend.
She lives up there.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.797
- It's
a little fundraiser thing.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.216
- A fundraiser?
Who do you think we are?

21:40.216 --> 21:41.926
We're like we need
a goddamn handout?

21:41.926 --> 21:43.636
- Dad.
- It's not a fundraiser for us.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.095
They're...

21:45.095 --> 21:47.890
they're donating the money
to mental health awareness.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.433
- The hell's that mean?

21:51.018 --> 21:52.353
- Like, suicide awareness.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.940
- You fucking kidding me?
- All right, Dad--

21:55.940 --> 21:57.358
This is how you
want to honor your son,

21:57.358 --> 21:58.442
by saying he was crazy?

21:58.442 --> 21:59.860
- How is this about me?

21:59.860 --> 22:01.153
- Dad, she didn't have anything
to do with this.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.072
- Mental health awareness.
- Co?

22:03.072 --> 22:04.073
You got some nerve, Lynn.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.241
All right, Conrad--

22:05.241 --> 22:06.283
- Dad, come on--
- You've got some nerve.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.743
You never even took Coco
to church.

22:07.743 --> 22:08.911
- All right, that's enough.
Mom, you gotta do something.

22:08.911 --> 22:10.246
- Your kids wouldn't know
the Lord's Prayer

22:10.246 --> 22:12.748
from their ass or elbow
if it weren't for us.

22:12.748 --> 22:15.584
And then you go, and you
desecrate Coco's body...

22:15.584 --> 22:17.253
- All right, Pop.
- By dumping it in the water

22:17.253 --> 22:18.754
like, uh, some heathen,

22:18.754 --> 22:20.881
and Co just goes along with it,
right like he always does.

22:20.881 --> 22:21.924
Along with it, right?

22:21.924 --> 22:23.425
- It's enough.
It's enough.

22:23.425 --> 22:24.677
- Co, gimme the goddamn key.
- Leave it, leave it.

22:24.677 --> 22:25.803
Come on, let's go.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.513
- I'm sorry.
Go.

22:34.478 --> 22:35.729
- Hey, Rob.

22:35.729 --> 22:38.232
- Hey, Michelle.
I got the Facebook invite.

22:38.232 --> 22:39.859
Um, why is it in Plainville?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.527
- I live here.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.696
<i>Yeah, but Coco didn't.</i>

22:43.696 --> 22:45.239
- Yeah, I know.

22:45.239 --> 22:46.615
I just didn't know
how to organize it in a town

22:46.615 --> 22:48.200
where I didn't know anyone.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.452
- me.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.496
That's why I thought
we were doing this together.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.876
- Are you mad at me?

22:56.876 --> 23:00.880
- No.
I'm--I'm just saying

23:00.880 --> 23:03.215
it might be tough for
everyone to make it up there.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.675
<i>You know, if--</i>
<i>if we have it down here,</i>

23:04.675 --> 23:06.176
<i>there's a better chance</i>
<i>his whole family can come,</i>

23:06.176 --> 23:07.386
<i>you know?</i>

23:09.221 --> 23:12.808
- I mean, we can change it,

23:12.808 --> 23:14.393
but then, like,
my friends and family

23:14.393 --> 23:16.312
are gonna have a hard time
making it down there too.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.439
- But Coco didn't know
any of them.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.361
- Oh, my God, wait.
I just realized

23:24.361 --> 23:26.071
this would be
such a nice getaway

23:26.071 --> 23:27.865
for Lynn and the girls,
don't you think?

23:27.865 --> 23:29.283
<i>I guess.</i>

23:29.283 --> 23:31.577
A fun adventure
to take their mind off things.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.332
<i>Are you still there?</i>

23:36.332 --> 23:38.334
- Yeah.

23:38.334 --> 23:41.003
- I already paid the deposit
for the field.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.796
It's non-refundable.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.966
But I could change it
if you want.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.885
I don't want this
to be a thing.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.512
- No, no, it's fine.

23:52.598 --> 23:55.434
I'll call Coco's league and see
who wants to make the drive.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.854
- That would be amazing.
Conrad would've loved that.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.649
- Yeah.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.150
You're such
<i>an amazing friend, Rob.</i>

24:03.150 --> 24:06.695
We're gonna make this event
perfect for him.

24:06.695 --> 24:10.199
You can be my co-captain
to finalize organizing.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.533
- Co-captain?

24:11.533 --> 24:12.910
I'm so excited.
<i>I got to go,</i>

24:12.910 --> 24:15.371
but, uh, let's--let's talk
about it later, okay?

24:15.371 --> 24:17.206
Bye.
Thank you, bye.

24:25.422 --> 24:28.050
- Michelle, everything okay?
- I'm fine.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.844
Can we put the deposit
down now?

24:31.470 --> 24:33.222
Sure.

24:43.649 --> 24:46.360
Gotta do something fun
for your last day.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.070
- Cute.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.743
Hey, wait for me.

24:54.743 --> 24:55.953
- Why?

24:55.953 --> 24:57.246
- Dad said I could come.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.372
- Are you fucking--

24:58.372 --> 25:00.207
- Hi, I'm Sydney.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.458
- Michelle.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.377
- You Coco's girlfriend?

25:04.169 --> 25:05.546
- Mm-mm.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.381
- Where are we going?

25:10.426 --> 25:11.844
You're prettier than the girls
Coco usually likes.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.262
- Seriously, Sydney, shut up.

25:13.262 --> 25:14.930
- You shut up.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.390
- I have a sister
about your age.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.183
- She an asshole?

25:18.183 --> 25:19.810
- Sometimes, yeah.

25:19.810 --> 25:20.936
- Can you go hang out
with Paige?

25:20.936 --> 25:21.937
- No.
- Please?

25:21.937 --> 25:23.772
- No.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.858
- Are the girls
in high school mean?

25:25.858 --> 25:28.777
- No, everybody's super nice.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.362
- Yeah, I--
I bet you're popular.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.622
- I'm hungry.
Do you want something?

25:40.622 --> 25:43.667
- I'm good.
- Hey, get in line.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.253
We'll, uh, guard the bikes.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.172
- No way.
- I'll pay for your slice.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.515
- Hey, let's go.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.142
- What?

27:20.973 --> 27:22.099
Found one.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.644
Not bad, not bad.
I can do better.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.939
- Hmm, ugly.

27:30.148 --> 27:33.360
It's gone.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.196
Okay, what about this one?

27:36.196 --> 27:37.489
- Better.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.288
So where do you go
to school down there?

27:45.038 --> 27:47.499
- Uh, Old Rochester.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.377
- You like it?

27:50.377 --> 27:52.421
- I actually didn't go there
all last year.

27:52.421 --> 27:56.091
Um, I worked with my dad
on his boats.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.093
He owns tugboats.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.386
- Hmm, that's cool.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.929
- Yeah, it's whatever.

28:04.683 --> 28:05.684
My parents pulled me out.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.477
I, um--I wasn't feeling...

28:10.689 --> 28:12.733
Very good.
I was...

28:22.409 --> 28:26.330
- Is that why you can't sleep?
You don't feel good?

28:28.332 --> 28:29.917
- I'm a thinker.

28:32.461 --> 28:33.712
Me too.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.716
- Yeah?
What you think about?

28:39.885 --> 28:43.263
- I don't know...

28:43.263 --> 28:46.808
Me?

28:46.808 --> 28:51.146
I don't always like me.
Is that weird?

28:52.981 --> 28:56.109
- I was weird enough that I had
to talk to a bunch of doctors.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.696
- I'm weird enough I have to...

29:03.784 --> 29:05.285
- I have to, like...

29:19.299 --> 29:20.759
- That's the one.

29:20.759 --> 29:24.471
- So you remember me
when you go back to Lameville.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.600
- It's not lame.

29:29.309 --> 29:32.312
You should come,
see for yourself.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.648
- What will your boyfriend
think about that?

29:36.066 --> 29:37.943
- I don't have a boyfriend.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.737
- Oh.
Me neither.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.280
- Ha ha.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.452
I've never had a boyfriend.

29:49.997 --> 29:51.331
- That's okay.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.793
I'm not really
dating anybody either.

29:57.963 --> 30:02.050
I'm too much trouble.
- Ooh.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.552
- It's charming, right?

30:04.720 --> 30:06.054
- Kind of.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.517
- Kind of cute?

30:13.478 --> 30:15.439
- You said that already.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.027
- Are you okay?

31:02.027 --> 31:05.697
- Yeah, no, of course.
It's just--it's a lot.

31:05.697 --> 31:09.242
- Okay.

31:09.242 --> 31:10.619
- I like it.

31:11.745 --> 31:12.913
- Me too.

31:14.456 --> 31:17.167
- Gotta go.

31:17.167 --> 31:20.003
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to, like--

31:20.003 --> 31:22.756
- No, it's not--

31:22.756 --> 31:24.549
My grandma.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.510
- Yeah, definitely.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.233
- Do you want my number?

31:41.233 --> 31:43.026
- Yeah, if you'll give it.

31:57.582 --> 31:58.959
What time are you
leaving tomorrow?

32:00.085 --> 32:02.003
- 9:00.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.797
I'll come say bye.

32:05.298 --> 32:06.716
- Okay.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.458
You all right?

32:40.458 --> 32:41.710
- Yeah.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.378
You sure?

32:44.296 --> 32:47.883
You--you look all right.
No broken bones, no blood.

32:50.051 --> 32:53.388
- Yeah, I'm fine.
What?

32:53.388 --> 32:54.514
- No, I just thought something

32:54.514 --> 32:55.807
really terrible
must have happened,

32:55.807 --> 32:57.809
since you left your sister
at a pizza shop.

33:09.362 --> 33:10.822
- I went out with a friend.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.658
- Mm-hmm.
You have fun?

33:15.994 --> 33:17.287
- Yeah.
- Good.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.625
- Listen, Dad--
- Shut your mouth.

33:21.625 --> 33:22.959
Take off
those stupid fucking ears.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.252
Take 'em off.

33:25.128 --> 33:29.090
What kind of a man abandons
his little sister?

33:29.090 --> 33:30.300
- I didn't abandon her.
She was fine.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.760
- She had to ask a stranger
to get her here.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.179
D'you know that?
Came home in tears.

33:36.640 --> 33:37.849
You gotta apologize.

33:38.683 --> 33:39.893
- Sorry.

33:39.893 --> 33:41.186
- To your sister, Coco!

33:42.771 --> 33:45.273
Get that look off
your face right now.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.358
Get it off.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.364
Go upstairs,

33:52.364 --> 33:54.491
make it right with Sydney,
and go to bed.

33:57.494 --> 33:58.787
- I'm hungry.

33:58.787 --> 34:00.163
Too bad dinner was at 5:00.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.623
- Dick.

34:01.623 --> 34:05.001
What?
What did you say to me?

34:08.129 --> 34:10.423
What the fuck did you
just say to me?

34:10.423 --> 34:13.343
Say it again.
Say it again, come on.

34:13.343 --> 34:14.636
What?
- I didn't--

34:20.141 --> 34:21.601
- Fuck.

34:36.533 --> 34:39.369
Get the hell out of here,
you fucking narc.

34:42.831 --> 34:45.208
I said get out!

35:01.057 --> 35:03.852
Come on, Michelle.
Let's go.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.012
- Thank you all for coming.

35:40.388 --> 35:43.475
It means so much to see you
all here for Conrad.

35:45.101 --> 35:48.980
These past few weeks
have been very hard.

35:50.649 --> 35:55.278
He was my best friend,
the love of my life.

35:56.905 --> 36:00.158
But I know, with your support,
we will all get through this.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.704
I miss you so much, Conrad.

36:04.704 --> 36:05.955
We love you, Michelle.

36:05.955 --> 36:08.416
Yeah, whoo!

36:12.712 --> 36:14.589
- Conrad was such
a bright light.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.759
He loved baseball.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.053
And I know he'll be
looking down on us

36:20.053 --> 36:23.181
with a smile on his face
as we honor him today.

36:24.057 --> 36:27.894
Now let's go hit
some homers for Conrad.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.239
- Hey, I was gonna
give a speech.

36:39.239 --> 36:42.659
- Oh, I didn't know
you wanted to say anything.

36:43.785 --> 36:45.537
- He was my best friend.

36:46.579 --> 36:49.416
- I'm sorry.
I just--I wasn't thinking.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.670
I just want everything
to go perfect today.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.883
- It's okay.
Never mind.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.180
- That was weird.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.974
- Be nice.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.274
Whoo!

37:17.610 --> 37:19.112
- Yeah.
- Come on, Michelle.

37:29.164 --> 37:30.498
Take your time.
Take your time.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.127
- Ah!

37:38.798 --> 37:40.300
Yes!

38:04.783 --> 38:06.534
Whoo!

38:06.534 --> 38:08.203
Great job, Joey.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.000
- I feel like my heart
is missing.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.752
- I know.

38:15.752 --> 38:19.756
- Lynn, hi.
I'm so glad you made the drive.

38:19.756 --> 38:21.341
- I wouldn't have missed it.

38:21.341 --> 38:25.178
It's so nice for Michelle
to put all this together.

38:25.178 --> 38:26.387
Means a lot.

38:26.387 --> 38:30.141
- Thank you.
I wanted to give you this.

38:30.141 --> 38:33.645
If you need something,
you want to talk.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.188
- What's a staging company?

38:35.188 --> 38:36.898
- Basically,
an interior designer for homes

38:36.898 --> 38:38.441
that are about to go
in the market.

38:38.441 --> 38:40.568
It makes it more appealing
to buyers.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.153
If you ever want to put
your house on the market,

38:42.153 --> 38:44.280
I'd be happy to help.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.115
- I rent.
- Oh.

38:46.115 --> 38:49.619
Well, homeownership
is not for everyone.

38:56.459 --> 39:00.505
Out of curiosity, has Michelle
been in contact with you?

39:01.756 --> 39:05.468
- Yeah, a bit.
Is everything okay?

39:05.468 --> 39:09.180
- She's just so young
to be dealing with all...

39:11.099 --> 39:14.686
I worry about her.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.522
I got our Verizon bill
a couple of days ago,

39:17.522 --> 39:21.943
and she's been texting
your son's phone.

39:23.236 --> 39:25.113
Maybe it's
her grieving process,

39:25.113 --> 39:27.907
but sometimes I worry
that maybe she's hopeful

39:27.907 --> 39:31.452
that he's somehow
going to respond.

39:34.247 --> 39:36.124
I'm--I'm so sorry.
This is a lot.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.625
I shouldn't be
telling you all this.

39:37.625 --> 39:40.211
- Lynn!

39:40.211 --> 39:42.171
Sorry
I didn't say hello earlier.

39:42.171 --> 39:43.548
I've been running around,

39:43.548 --> 39:45.258
trying to make everything
perfect.

39:45.258 --> 39:47.427
- This is
the famous Michelle Carter.

39:48.469 --> 39:50.680
You've done a great job.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.891
- I would do anything
for Conrad.

39:54.934 --> 39:57.103
I'll be over there
if you need me, okay?

39:57.103 --> 39:58.813
- Yeah, thanks, Mom.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.482
Is there anything
I can get you?

40:01.482 --> 40:03.860
- No, I'm just--I'm glad

40:03.860 --> 40:05.820
the kids
are having fun out there.

40:18.207 --> 40:20.793
- That weekend in Florida,

40:20.793 --> 40:23.296
he brought me flowers
the morning I left.

40:24.923 --> 40:28.927
- Coco?
My Coco?

40:28.927 --> 40:31.262
- Flowers?

40:31.262 --> 40:33.723
- Purple lilies.
They were beautiful.

40:33.723 --> 40:35.850
- Huh.

40:35.850 --> 40:39.270
I didn't even know he had
a romantic bone in him.

40:39.270 --> 40:42.315
Guess that skipped
a generation or two.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.572
- We had such deep
conversations, you know,

40:49.572 --> 40:51.532
about our lives, about you.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.542
I was wondering
if you brought that note.

41:02.877 --> 41:04.754
- What?

41:04.754 --> 41:06.339
- The note Conrad left for me.

41:06.339 --> 41:08.800
I texted you about it
a couple of times.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.386
- Oh, no.
I--I don't have it.

41:11.386 --> 41:13.346
- It's totally fine, of course.

41:17.266 --> 41:21.688
- What did he say about me?

41:24.649 --> 41:27.360
You said he talked about me?

41:27.360 --> 41:29.696
- Oh, yeah, he said that--

41:29.696 --> 41:31.406
Dogs!

41:31.406 --> 41:32.991
- Sorry, one second.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.003
YOLO.

41:51.259 --> 41:53.511
- What is that?
- Is it bad?

41:56.180 --> 41:58.808
- So you friends
with Conrad or Michelle?

41:58.808 --> 42:01.519
- Michelle.

42:01.519 --> 42:02.937
She's lucky
to have you.

42:04.564 --> 42:06.107
Did--did you know Conrad?

42:06.107 --> 42:07.442
- Only what she told us.

42:07.442 --> 42:09.193
- Never met him?

42:12.905 --> 42:15.074
I can't imagine what
she's going through right now.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.743
- I know.
It's--it's been brutal.

42:16.743 --> 42:20.288
- Yeah, when he went missing,
she was, like, freaking out.

42:21.581 --> 42:22.915
- Missing?

42:22.915 --> 42:26.210
- Yeah, he was missing
for, like, three days.

42:26.210 --> 42:28.504
- Three days?
You're sure about that?

42:28.504 --> 42:30.506
She was texting us
the whole time.

42:30.506 --> 42:33.885
Said when he wasn't responding,
she knew something was wrong.

42:33.885 --> 42:37.263
She said the family was out
looking for him all weekend.

42:37.263 --> 42:39.891
Even you guys.

42:39.891 --> 42:42.018
- The police?

42:42.018 --> 42:44.812
- Isn't this, like,
something you should know?

42:47.273 --> 42:50.651
- Yeah, yeah, it is.

42:52.361 --> 42:54.030
- Nat! Cass!

42:58.493 --> 43:00.328
- Nice talking to you.
- Yeah.

43:05.958 --> 43:09.295
- Um...

43:09.295 --> 43:11.005
Let's do our own.
Yeah?

43:16.260 --> 43:17.553
- Yeah.

43:17.553 --> 43:19.764
Coming in.
Think I got some good ones.

43:20.640 --> 43:24.977
- Thank you.
- Oh, that's good.

43:24.977 --> 43:26.896
- Cute.

43:29.524 --> 43:33.444
- Hey, so, um,

43:33.444 --> 43:36.572
Conrad was missing
for three days, right?

43:36.572 --> 43:39.408
- Yeah, why?
- Some guy was asking.

43:39.408 --> 43:43.996
- What guy?

43:43.996 --> 43:46.374
- I think he's a cop.

44:06.060 --> 44:10.314
- Michelle?
You okay?

44:10.314 --> 44:12.150
- It's fine.
Yeah, I'm fine.

44:55.610 --> 44:57.486
I'm really proud
of you, Michelle.

44:58.613 --> 45:01.699
- Yeah.

45:01.699 --> 45:04.869
I just have to run in.
I'll be a minute.
