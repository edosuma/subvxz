00:53.387 --> 00:55.264
Christ, it's almost midnight.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.892
Nothing like putting in some overtime
to save a miserable serial killer.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.978
Alleged serial killer.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.272
Right.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.830
- Well...

01:19.997 --> 01:23.037
maybe one of these days we'll actually
defend somebody who's really innocent.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.270
- A man is innocent until proven guilty.
- Until proven guilty.

01:25.294 --> 01:29.882
Look, you and I both know that son of
a bitch killed 14 people in cold blood.

01:29.965 --> 01:33.468
- I just hope there's nothing to this karma thing.
- Oh, please.

01:35.762 --> 01:40.392
- Ah, come on. What the hell?

01:40.475 --> 01:42.978
And I don't want to hear
anything about any karma.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.359
- What's going on?
- I'm gonna find out.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.135
I'm gonna check out the elevator shaft.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.888
- Yeah, okay.
- Maybe there's a way out.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.153
- Oh, Jesus.

02:33.278 --> 02:37.991
- What's happening? Are they bats?

02:38.075 --> 02:40.160
- Danny?

02:44.623 --> 02:49.545
Oh, God! Oh, God! Somebody help me!
Please! Please! Somebody help me!

02:49.670 --> 02:51.797
Please!
Oh, God! Please!

03:03.183 --> 03:05.185
No! No! No! No!

04:22.971 --> 04:26.391
Ah, come on. Just when it was
getting to the good part.

04:26.475 --> 04:30.562
- Christ, not again.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.235
Hey, take a little breather, honey.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.570
I lost my concentration.

04:46.078 --> 04:49.873
Goddamn piece of crap.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.085
Looks like the only thing
working around here is me.

04:53.168 --> 04:56.046
- Sons of bitches.
- That's what you get...

04:56.171 --> 04:58.131
for stealing cable, Buck.

05:01.134 --> 05:05.264
The first full solar eclipse to be seen
locally in over 35 years...

05:05.389 --> 05:07.266
while transporting
Luther Heggs...

05:07.391 --> 05:11.478
from the Kern County Jail
to the Huntsville State Penitentiary.

05:11.562 --> 05:14.898
Heggs, you may remember,
was convicted for armed robbery.

05:14.982 --> 05:18.652
An unscheduled stop was made
at a gas station rest room.

05:18.694 --> 05:23.490
When Heggs persuaded the deputy to remove one
of the cuffs so he could use the toilet...

05:23.574 --> 05:25.868
Heggs severely beat the deputy...

05:25.993 --> 05:29.288
wrestled away the key
to the cuffs and fled the scene.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.474
- Looks like Luther beat the dog shit...
- In a moment we'll be speaking...

05:31.498 --> 05:34.168
- out of that boy.
- To legendary Texas Ranger Otis Lawson.

05:34.293 --> 05:38.881
Officer Lawson, could we have the latest
developments concerning Luther Heggs?

05:38.964 --> 05:41.592
Yes. Uh, we have
all available...

05:41.675 --> 05:45.679
Hey, ain't that the old boy who put you
away in that Lubbock bank job?

05:45.762 --> 05:48.599
Rotten bastard.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.684
I'd like to say that...

05:50.767 --> 05:55.564
I-I-I will personally
track down Luther Heggs...

05:55.689 --> 05:58.066
and drag his ass back
to the penitentiary...

05:58.192 --> 06:00.569
where the sorry son of a bitch belongs.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.369
All right, asshole.
Start talking.

06:09.494 --> 06:13.498
- You got a warrant, Otis?
- Did I give you that?

06:13.582 --> 06:16.168
Damn, Sheriff. I thought I...
Let's see, did you...

06:16.293 --> 06:21.298
- There is it. ls that warrant
enough for you? Huh?

06:21.381 --> 06:24.468
- Forget about the warrant, Otis.
- Okay.

06:24.593 --> 06:28.889
- Thank you for cooperating.

06:28.972 --> 06:32.768
Now, where is he?
Don't say, "Who?"

06:32.893 --> 06:34.978
I ain't heard a peep from him.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.983
Oh, shit. Goddamn.

06:40.067 --> 06:44.780
Luther and me...
We ain't as tight as we once was.

06:44.863 --> 06:48.492
Ever since l went straight.
I don't run in them circles.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.786
Bullshit, Buck.
Goddamn it.

06:50.869 --> 06:54.790
You're a criminal.
You always were, and you always will be.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.876
- Just like your daddy.
- No, I swear to God, Otis.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.878
- I'm selling them Swifty products.
- Shut up.

07:00.087 --> 07:04.299
- Show her the picture.
- You seen this man?

07:04.383 --> 07:07.386
- Yes, I have.
- When and where?

07:07.469 --> 07:10.264
About an hour ago, on the TV.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.978
Do you think we're just wasting
our time coming over here...

07:16.103 --> 07:18.188
like we suck farts out of a dead chicken?

07:18.272 --> 07:22.192
- She don't know nothing about it.
- She might not, but you sure do.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.403
'Cause you and Luther
are butt-buddies...

07:24.486 --> 07:26.989
from way back.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.199
And sooner or later, he's
gonna contact you...

07:29.283 --> 07:32.202
and when he does, we'll be waiting.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.663
Don't forget that, slick.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.084
Ma'am.

07:40.586 --> 07:44.173
- Yeah?

07:45.591 --> 07:49.887
- Well, hey, Mama.
- Shit.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.448
Yeah, well, listen, Mama. I'm gonna have to
call you back a little bit later, all right?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.892
- All right. I love you too.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.896
- Buck... your mama's dead.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.689
- Yeah?
- You clear?

08:00.772 --> 08:03.775
- It is now. Are you okay?
- Yeah. l've been better.

08:03.901 --> 08:06.069
Listen up, man.
That Mexican bank deal is back on.

08:06.195 --> 08:08.071
We gotta move double fast, though.

08:08.197 --> 08:11.283
- Are you sure the money's still there?
- Yeah, it's still there.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.285
Five million in freshly-laundered...

08:13.368 --> 08:15.704
gringo drug money.

08:15.787 --> 08:19.142
Round up a crew and meet me at that El Coyote
Motel across the border tomorrow night.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.084
All right, Luther.

08:21.168 --> 08:25.380
Shit. I gotta get out
of here, man.

08:25.464 --> 08:29.384
I'll be in around 7:30,
run the whole thing down to everybody.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.097
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

08:35.682 --> 08:37.392
- the champion of champions...

08:37.476 --> 08:40.270
Roddy Pugh!

08:43.065 --> 08:46.068
All right! Yeah!

08:46.193 --> 08:48.987
Hang on, cowboy,
I'm coming. Come here, bull! Come to me!

08:49.071 --> 08:51.198
Come to me, baby!
Come here!

08:51.281 --> 08:53.492
Watch out for that there bull!

08:53.575 --> 08:57.871
Come on! Better run, better run!

09:00.874 --> 09:04.378
There goes Widow Maker!

09:09.800 --> 09:11.802
Howdy, C.W.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.804
Did you see it?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.764
Yep.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.475
I reckon I've lost a step.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.978
I reckon.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.564
So how the hell
are things, C.W.?

09:24.773 --> 09:27.484
Well, I fractured my ass bone...

09:27.568 --> 09:29.486
Fay left me...

09:29.570 --> 09:31.780
I'm three months behind on my note...

09:31.864 --> 09:33.991
and I had to hock my horse and trailer.

09:34.032 --> 09:38.078
Goddamn, man. lf your dog was dead,
we'd have us a country song.

09:38.203 --> 09:41.999
Scooter got hit by a car
and killed last month.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.377
Jesus, C.W., I'm sorry.
I was just joking, man.

09:45.502 --> 09:50.382
Oh, hell, Buck. You know me and
good luck was always strangers.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.676
So what's the pitch?

09:52.801 --> 09:56.388
I'm guessing you didn't come here
to scout my clowning skills.

09:56.471 --> 09:59.183
Nah, there's no clowning involved here.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.186
Luther's got a deal going.
Looks like a good one.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.479
We need you to open the box.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.191
- Is my end more than a hundred thou?
- Way more.

10:49.066 --> 10:54.196
Jesus, it's Buck. Don't shoot,
you paranoid son of a bitch.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.282
Didn't you see the signs?

10:57.366 --> 11:01.745
The only thing I gotta beware of
is your crazy ass. Got a beer?

11:25.894 --> 11:30.065
- Jaws is looking pretty strong.
- Jaws is dead.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.776
I lost him in a fight a while back.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.070
This is Jaws 2.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.573
I got him on the juice.

11:37.698 --> 11:41.702
You're pumping steroids into a pooch?
Damn, Jesus.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.787
That's immoral.

11:43.871 --> 11:48.792
Hey, it ain't the fuckin' Olympics,
Buck. I mean, this is dog fighting.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.295
He's got a big match coming up.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.801
Hey, go, Jaws, go!

12:12.566 --> 12:15.694
I got a deal you might want to get in on.

12:15.777 --> 12:18.280
Who's setting up the deal?

12:18.405 --> 12:21.366
- Luther.
- Besides you and Luther...

12:21.491 --> 12:24.286
who else is on the crew?

12:24.369 --> 12:27.497
C.W. Niles and Ray Bob.

12:27.581 --> 12:31.585
Ray Bob?
He's an idiot.

12:31.793 --> 12:34.796
I don't work with idiots.
They get you killed.

12:34.880 --> 12:38.383
Yeah, well, you don't pick the crew, l do.

12:38.467 --> 12:43.096
And I say he's in.
You don't like it, fuck you.

12:53.482 --> 12:56.193
- What would my end be?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.987
- Figure 600 grand, give or take.

13:00.781 --> 13:04.785
- How's that Lincoln running?
- Like a burnt dead dog.

13:08.497 --> 13:11.500
Good boy!
That's a good boy!

13:11.583 --> 13:14.378
Go, Jaws! Go!
Yeah, that's a good boy.

13:57.171 --> 14:00.007
Bucky!
What the hell!

14:00.090 --> 14:02.885
What do you want to sneak up
on me like that for, huh, Bucky?

14:02.968 --> 14:05.071
That's some tight-ass security
you got going here, Ray Bob.

14:05.095 --> 14:08.390
I thought you was the damn supervisor.

14:08.599 --> 14:11.476
Oh, hell, Bucky.

14:11.602 --> 14:13.979
There ain't nothing here to guard anyway.

14:14.104 --> 14:17.274
- So what's up?
- A job's what's up.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.568
Set us up for a good long time.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.570
Yeah?
I don't know, Bucky.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.907
- I mean, Alma's got me on such a short leash and all.
- Knock it off...

14:24.990 --> 14:27.701
you pussy-whipped son of a bitch.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.870
I'm going out on the line for you here.

14:29.995 --> 14:31.997
You ain't exactly everybody's first choice.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.291
Really?

14:34.374 --> 14:37.085
Wh-When-When's this
supposed to happen?

14:37.169 --> 14:40.088
- We hit the road tomorrow.
Going to Mexico.

14:40.172 --> 14:43.675
- What am I gonna tell Alma?
- I don't care what you tell her.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.887
You just pack a bag, bring your .45
and be ready to roll at high noon.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.475
Get some sleep.

15:23.799 --> 15:26.301
- Twice a day.
- Si, senor.

15:30.097 --> 15:34.184
Hey, Buck, C.W.
Nice ride, Jesus.

16:05.007 --> 16:08.594
- Well, l had to tell her something.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.893
Ray Bob, we don't need this shit.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.367
Ready.

16:58.477 --> 17:02.397
El Coyote?
What's that mean in American, Jesus?

17:02.481 --> 17:04.608
The coyote.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.902
- It ideal.
- Come in with me, Jesus.

17:06.984 --> 17:10.989
Just in case I gotta talk Mexican.

17:11.073 --> 17:14.867
C.W., take the car down to number seven,
start unloading the gear.

17:29.591 --> 17:32.469
Howdy.
You speak English, lady?

17:32.594 --> 17:35.472
English, Spanish and a
little bit of Japanese.

17:35.681 --> 17:39.101
We need a room.
Number seven will do.

17:53.407 --> 17:55.492
Hey, baby.

17:55.576 --> 17:59.371
El fucko?

17:59.496 --> 18:01.582
Sweet Jesus.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.592
Come on, Jesus.

18:11.675 --> 18:15.429
- Now ain't the time.

18:15.596 --> 18:17.890
Let's get this crap inside quick.

18:17.973 --> 18:19.850
Yowza, boss.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.503
- This movie is very low quality.

18:47.586 --> 18:49.671
Don't look that bad to me.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.966
- There's no story.
- It's a fuck movie.

18:53.091 --> 18:56.303
I don't watch a fuck movie for the story.

18:56.345 --> 18:58.972
I watch a fuck movie to see fuckin'.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.391
I got to side with Jesus on this one.

19:01.475 --> 19:05.229
I personally appreciate
an attempt at telling a story.

19:05.395 --> 19:10.275
When I care more about the characters,
I care more about the fucking.

19:10.400 --> 19:14.196
Now, my main complaint
about this movie here...

19:14.279 --> 19:17.991
is we've been watching it
for something like a half hour,

19:18.075 --> 19:20.702
- and there ain't been no ass fuckin'.

20:38.906 --> 20:42.784
- Fuck me runnin'.

21:40.509 --> 21:44.972
This is my kind of place.

22:08.495 --> 22:11.081
Christ.

22:16.211 --> 22:19.006
- Howdy.

22:19.089 --> 22:22.676
Give me a shot of tequila, man.

22:22.801 --> 22:24.636
Here you go.

22:27.890 --> 22:31.810
Goddamn, man!

22:33.478 --> 22:38.692
Give me a... shot of whiskey
or something.

22:38.734 --> 22:42.988
Say, what would be the odds
of gettin' a cab out here?

22:43.071 --> 22:46.783
Odds of getting a cab
are about zero to none.

22:46.909 --> 22:49.703
- No cabs come out here.
- Shit.

22:49.786 --> 22:52.998
- You got car trouble?
- Yeah. Weirdest thing, man.

22:53.081 --> 22:55.375
I hit a fuckin' bat.

22:55.501 --> 22:57.586
Messed up my vehicle real good.

22:57.711 --> 23:00.506
Hell, you say.
Where you headed?

23:00.589 --> 23:04.593
- That El Coyote Motel.
- I get off in about half hour.

23:04.676 --> 23:07.304
Would you like a lift?

23:15.187 --> 23:17.981
- Yep?
- Hey, Buck. Broke down, man.

23:18.106 --> 23:20.400
Luther, we were starting
to worry about you, boy.

23:20.484 --> 23:22.778
- Want us to come and get you?
- No, y'all stay put.

23:22.903 --> 23:24.780
This old boy here is gonna give me a lift.

23:27.574 --> 23:30.494
Mighty decent of you, man.
I appreciate it.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.496
No problem.

23:34.498 --> 23:36.792
What kind of bat did you hit?

23:36.875 --> 23:39.586
I don't know, man.
A fuckin' bat. A big one.

23:39.711 --> 23:43.298
- You know, there's many varieties of bats.
- Yeah?

23:43.382 --> 23:45.801
I didn't know that.

23:45.884 --> 23:49.012
Damn thing scared the
shit out of me, though.

23:49.096 --> 23:52.307
I pumped a bullet in the bastard.

24:05.904 --> 24:09.199
Aren't we going the wrong
direction here, man?

24:14.788 --> 24:17.583
Is that your jeep?

24:17.708 --> 24:19.710
Yeah.

24:19.793 --> 24:23.505
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry here.
You know what I mean?

24:23.589 --> 24:25.507
Just take a second.
Come on.

24:40.189 --> 24:44.610
You said you hit a big, old fuckin' bat.
Where is it?

24:44.693 --> 24:48.906
Well, man, I imagine it
crawled off somewhere to die.

24:48.989 --> 24:52.409
I don't see no point in all of this.

24:52.492 --> 24:55.704
Oh, there's a point, all right.

25:01.502 --> 25:04.087
Victor.

25:04.213 --> 25:06.882
Victor.

25:07.007 --> 25:09.593
Victor.

25:20.187 --> 25:22.105
How bad is it?

25:22.189 --> 25:24.608
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

25:32.199 --> 25:35.285
Damn, man. You need to get
to a hospital, quick like.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.788
Is this him?

25:37.913 --> 25:41.583
Yeah, that's him.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.794
What the fuck you talkin' about, man?

25:43.877 --> 25:46.004
I ain't never seen this guy in my life.

25:53.804 --> 25:56.974
I think this belongs to you.

26:03.313 --> 26:05.399
Victor.

26:05.482 --> 26:08.610
- Fuck.

27:14.510 --> 27:18.597
Oh, God!

27:23.894 --> 27:26.980
Come on, fuckin' bat!

27:27.105 --> 27:30.692
Come on!
Look out for the gun!

27:45.999 --> 27:47.876
Adios.

27:49.503 --> 27:52.798
Fuck.

29:11.084 --> 29:13.212
Boy, I'd sure like to do me...

29:13.295 --> 29:16.215
one of them porno star bitches.

29:16.298 --> 29:20.385
I did me one of them
porno star bitches once.

29:20.511 --> 29:23.180
She had a small part in
Splendor in the Ass 2.

29:23.305 --> 29:25.516
- You ever see that?
- No, I never saw it.

29:25.599 --> 29:28.602
But I'd sure go rent it.
Which one is she?

29:28.685 --> 29:32.397
She's in the scene
where Wendy West goes to the dentist.

29:32.481 --> 29:35.609
There's this black female dentist...

29:35.692 --> 29:38.695
and a red-haired
dentist's helper.

29:38.779 --> 29:40.781
I hammered the redhead.

29:40.906 --> 29:42.699
What happened at the dentist's?

29:42.908 --> 29:46.203
They all fuck each other.
What do you think? lt's a porno movie.

29:47.913 --> 29:52.292
- I know this Mexican guy, Carlos.

29:52.376 --> 29:55.879
He found out his sister
was doing porno in L.A.

29:56.004 --> 29:59.299
So he waited till she was
doing another porno film...

29:59.383 --> 30:01.301
and he went down to the set...

30:01.385 --> 30:03.387
with a shotgun.

30:03.512 --> 30:06.098
And he went completely crazy.

30:13.188 --> 30:15.107
Carlos!

30:15.190 --> 30:17.484
He shot the director.

30:19.278 --> 30:23.407
- He shot the cameraman.

30:23.490 --> 30:26.285
- No! No!

30:26.410 --> 30:29.788
He shot the guy who was drilling her.

30:33.292 --> 30:35.586
And then...

30:35.711 --> 30:38.005
he even shot the guy...

30:38.088 --> 30:40.090
who brings the doughnuts.

30:40.215 --> 30:42.885
Huh?

30:48.682 --> 30:51.476
Man, this is just so cool, guys.

30:51.602 --> 30:54.605
I mean, I'm gettin' to do
a big job with all my buddies.

30:54.688 --> 30:57.691
- I mean, this is so great.
- Hey, Ray Bob.

30:57.816 --> 30:59.610
Do you know who was asking about you?

30:59.693 --> 31:02.779
- No, who?
- No one.

31:02.905 --> 31:07.576
- Get off his ass, Jesus.

31:07.701 --> 31:10.579
I ain't on his ass yet.

31:10.704 --> 31:13.290
I ain't gonna have internal
squabbling on this deal.

31:17.586 --> 31:21.006
- Where the hell you goin'?
- For a walk.

31:21.089 --> 31:26.595
Yeah, well, don't stray too far.
Luther's due any time.

31:29.681 --> 31:32.601
I bet you my ass he's going over
to that little senorita's room...

31:32.684 --> 31:36.813
- to get his dick wet.
- Kind of figured Luther'd be here by now.

35:20.787 --> 35:23.415
Luther.

35:23.498 --> 35:25.584
What are you doing here?

35:25.709 --> 35:28.212
I just dropped in for a quick bite.

35:33.383 --> 35:37.679
- What the fuck!

37:01.138 --> 37:03.265
Take that, bitch!

38:19.091 --> 38:23.512
No. No. No. No.

38:55.294 --> 38:59.381
- Who is it?
- It's room service.

38:59.464 --> 39:01.383
Open up, you idiots.

39:05.095 --> 39:07.014
Look who l found.

39:10.809 --> 39:12.811
Hot damn, Luther.

39:12.895 --> 39:15.647
- I ain't seen you in a coon's age.
- C.W.

39:15.814 --> 39:19.985
God Almighty, Luther. We thought
you was never even gonna show up.

39:20.110 --> 39:23.197
I got dropped off up the
road a piece there.

39:24.781 --> 39:27.659
Hoofed it the last mile or so.

39:29.203 --> 39:31.705
Damn, Jesus.

39:31.788 --> 39:33.874
That little split tail
drain the life out of you?

39:33.999 --> 39:36.084
You look like a damn ghost.

39:36.210 --> 39:38.212
She sucked me dry.

39:38.295 --> 39:40.881
Damn.

39:42.090 --> 39:43.717
Hey, Luther.

39:45.511 --> 39:50.015
I just wanted to say I appreciate
you bringing me on this job and all.

39:50.182 --> 39:53.602
All right, girls.
Gather 'round.

39:57.314 --> 40:00.484
The bank's in Bravos,
right here near the border.

40:00.609 --> 40:03.403
When you planning on
pulling this thing off?

40:03.487 --> 40:07.699
- We'll be going on this little expedition tonight.
- "Tonight"?

40:07.783 --> 40:10.494
God dog, you gotta be kiddin' me.

40:10.619 --> 40:13.413
We got to work things out.

40:13.497 --> 40:15.499
Case the joint, shit like that.

40:15.582 --> 40:18.919
Yeah, Luther, I never knowed you
to go into a deal half-cocked.

40:19.002 --> 40:21.213
We're gonna do this thing my way...

40:21.296 --> 40:23.715
which means we're gonna do it tonight.

40:23.799 --> 40:26.301
Or all of you are gonna
walk away with nothin'.

40:26.510 --> 40:29.012
Are you homos in or are you out?

40:29.096 --> 40:31.181
I'm in.

40:31.265 --> 40:35.978
Well, I sure as hell ain't walkin' away
from 600 grand and change.

40:36.103 --> 40:38.188
What's the big hurry, Luther?

40:38.313 --> 40:40.148
What the hell are you?
Cinderella?

40:40.315 --> 40:42.901
For one thing, that motel clerk
got a good look at me.

40:42.985 --> 40:45.320
I think she might have made me.

40:45.362 --> 40:48.949
Well, now, you might ought to have
mentioned that to me before.

40:49.116 --> 40:51.410
Well, I'll fill you in
on a need-to-know basis.

40:51.493 --> 40:53.412
Well, I need to know everything.

40:53.495 --> 40:55.414
All right then.

40:55.497 --> 40:58.083
From now on, Buck, I'll
tell you everything.

40:58.208 --> 41:00.961
- Fair enough?
- Yeah.

41:01.086 --> 41:02.921
Are you in or not?

41:09.011 --> 41:11.305
I reckon I'm in.

41:11.388 --> 41:13.390
All right then.

41:13.473 --> 41:15.893
Let's head 'em up and move 'em out!

41:21.982 --> 41:24.401
What the hell we need this stuff for?

41:24.610 --> 41:26.486
I think it looks cool.

41:28.197 --> 41:30.115
Just a precaution.

42:19.581 --> 42:22.292
Looks like a goddamn bloodbath.

42:22.417 --> 42:24.378
You tryin' to be funny?

42:24.503 --> 42:27.506
No, sir.

42:27.548 --> 42:30.676
Why don't you go on
outside and get some air?

42:30.801 --> 42:32.719
Yeah.

42:35.806 --> 42:38.392
What's his problem?

42:38.475 --> 42:42.896
My boy's suffering from some serious hurt.

42:43.021 --> 42:46.400
Them Gecko brothers killed his daddy.

42:46.483 --> 42:49.444
- You remember old McGraw, don't you?
- Sure.

42:49.611 --> 42:53.699
Sons of bitches shot old
Earl dead in the head.

42:53.782 --> 42:56.910
What the hell you figure happened here?

42:56.994 --> 42:59.997
God only knows, and He ain't talkin'.

43:35.782 --> 43:38.785
Jesus, when you guys are done unloading...

43:38.911 --> 43:40.787
pull the car out in front
of the bank there.

43:40.913 --> 43:42.915
In just a minute...

43:42.998 --> 43:45.083
I'm gonna open this here door.

43:45.167 --> 43:48.086
How the hell are you gonna do that?

43:48.212 --> 43:50.380
I done told you.

43:50.506 --> 43:53.300
I got this thing all worked out, man.

44:45.811 --> 44:47.688
God Almighty, Luther.

44:47.771 --> 44:50.607
You'd think somebody had done and gone
give you the keys to the place.

45:21.096 --> 45:23.515
What did you have to kill the guard for?

45:24.600 --> 45:26.685
It was him or me, Buck.

45:34.109 --> 45:36.486
What about the other alarms?

45:36.612 --> 45:38.965
There are a couple of motion detectors
back here by the safe.

45:38.989 --> 45:40.991
You guys won't have to worry about that.

45:41.116 --> 45:43.994
C.W., crack this box.

45:55.797 --> 45:58.300
Jesus Christ.

46:33.210 --> 46:35.420
- All right, C.W.

46:35.504 --> 46:38.924
Do your magic.
Don't touch nothin' you don't have to.

46:57.484 --> 46:59.403
What's wrong, Luth?

46:59.486 --> 47:02.823
A little asthma attack.
That's all. Let's go.

47:16.712 --> 47:19.089
Yee-ha!

47:27.598 --> 47:31.018
So far, so good, huh, Bucky?

47:31.101 --> 47:33.604
I don't think so, Ray Bob.

47:33.812 --> 47:35.814
We got us a dead guard here.

47:35.898 --> 47:40.485
When them Mexicans catch us, they're
gonna fry our asses or hang us... one.

47:40.611 --> 47:42.487
Oh, man.

48:00.589 --> 48:03.008
You're a goddamn artist, C.W.

48:03.091 --> 48:06.303
- lt's an honor just watching you work.

48:06.512 --> 48:08.514
Just let me know when you need
the lubricating oil.

48:08.597 --> 48:11.808
What are you tryin' to do, cornhole me?

48:11.892 --> 48:15.020
Back off a little bit, Luther.
Give me a little room to work here.

48:15.103 --> 48:17.689
And get this goddamn thing out of the way.

48:17.814 --> 48:21.401
- Luther, you all right?

48:23.612 --> 48:25.614
Asthma, my ass.

48:46.301 --> 48:49.721
I vote we get out of here
while we've still got a chance.

48:52.391 --> 48:55.686
- Cops are on the way.
Let's get out of here.

48:55.811 --> 48:59.690
- Damn it. All right,
time is still on our side.

48:59.815 --> 49:02.001
Now, all those cops can do
is slow us down a little bit.

49:02.025 --> 49:05.112
- "Slow us down"?
Hell, they'll kill our asses.
- We ain't goin' anywhere.

49:05.195 --> 49:08.407
C.W. has almost got this thing licked
now. You just settle your ass down.

49:08.490 --> 49:12.119
- What are you, retarded?
Let's get out of here!
- Back off, man!

49:12.202 --> 49:14.705
We're about to be millionaires.

49:16.415 --> 49:19.293
We're gonna be dead millionaires,
we don't move it.

49:19.418 --> 49:22.421
Get out of here
if you want to. l don't care.

49:22.504 --> 49:24.298
Just leave more for us.

49:33.807 --> 49:35.893
Come on, Ray Bob,
let's get the hell out of here.

49:36.018 --> 49:38.812
- What about the money, Bucky?
- It's over, Ray Bob.

49:38.896 --> 49:41.315
There ain't gonna be no money.
Now, let's go.

49:43.192 --> 49:45.319
You comin' with us?

49:45.402 --> 49:47.321
I'll take my chances.

49:47.404 --> 49:49.823
Well, you're as crazy as they are.

49:55.913 --> 49:58.624
- What do we do now, Bucky?

49:58.707 --> 50:02.503
- Run!

50:02.586 --> 50:05.088
- Man, they're everywhere.
- Shit!

50:09.009 --> 50:12.387
- They're shootin' at us, Buck!
- Get back inside!

50:12.513 --> 50:17.726
- You said we was gonna make it, Bucky.
- Shut up, Ray Bob!

50:25.609 --> 50:29.905
Hey, I was just starting to miss you guys.

50:48.423 --> 50:51.009
Listen up, you idiots!

50:51.093 --> 50:54.012
Get out of there and come out
with your hands up...

50:54.096 --> 50:56.014
and we will not kill you.

50:56.098 --> 50:58.725
I give you my word.

50:58.809 --> 51:00.811
Take your time and think it over.

51:00.894 --> 51:03.021
You've got two minutes.

51:03.105 --> 51:05.399
Ah, Jesus Christ!

51:05.524 --> 51:08.026
Oh, God Almighty.

51:27.004 --> 51:28.922
I don't know how many
of them are in there...

51:29.006 --> 51:31.008
but your boy, Buck, is one of them.

51:31.216 --> 51:33.594
Well, I'll tell you one thing, Chief.

51:33.719 --> 51:35.387
You work pretty damn fast.

51:42.519 --> 51:45.898
Hey, baby. I thought I told you
never to call me at work.

51:46.023 --> 51:50.027
- This is Lawson here.
- Otis. Hey, how's your wife tasting?

51:50.110 --> 51:52.821
None of your business, you son of a bitch.

51:52.905 --> 51:56.116
First off, who the hell are you,
and is Luther Heggs in there?

51:56.200 --> 51:59.411
I'm Jesus, and, yeah, Luther's here.

51:59.494 --> 52:03.790
And Buck Bowers, who you know intimately.

52:03.916 --> 52:06.293
Then, goddamn it, put Buck on.

52:07.503 --> 52:09.421
You stupid bastard.

52:09.505 --> 52:12.424
You're lucky I ain't done
put a bullet in your head.

52:18.222 --> 52:20.599
Yeah?

52:20.724 --> 52:24.228
Well, you cornholed the
pooch this time, boy.

52:24.311 --> 52:27.189
Oh, I'd have to agree with you
on that one, Otis.

52:27.314 --> 52:31.109
There is a bank guard in there
by the name of Reuben Salto Guitierrez.

52:31.193 --> 52:33.111
We want to speak to him.

52:33.195 --> 52:37.616
You got a bank guard in there by
the name of Reuben ""Salsa Goudaresm... ""

52:37.699 --> 52:40.994
H-H-How the hell you pronounce it?
Put him on the phone.

52:41.119 --> 52:43.914
- I want to speak to him.
- Uh...

52:43.997 --> 52:46.291
Well, he's still alive, isn't he?

52:46.416 --> 52:48.502
Sure, he's fine.

52:48.627 --> 52:50.295
Well, then put him on the phone.

52:50.420 --> 52:52.798
Give me a minute.

52:52.923 --> 52:57.928
Jesus... tell him
everything's okay in Mexican.

53:05.102 --> 53:08.105
There you go.
Told you he's okay.

53:15.612 --> 53:19.116
Now, listen up, Buck.
Let the guard go.

53:19.199 --> 53:22.202
You guys come out with
your hands up high...

53:22.327 --> 53:25.414
and we promise that we
ain't gonna kill you.

53:25.497 --> 53:28.417
Well, now, Otis, l think
I'm gonna have to pass on that offer.

53:28.500 --> 53:32.588
What about this:
We take the guard with us.

53:32.713 --> 53:35.424
You give us a ten-minute head start,
and then we'll let him go.

53:35.507 --> 53:39.720
- Ain't gonna happen, Bucko.
- Come on, Otis. Work with me here.

53:39.803 --> 53:43.098
Now, the way l figure...

53:43.223 --> 53:45.100
- Hello?
- What the hell are you doin', man?

53:45.225 --> 53:48.604
- That was our last chance to make a deal!
- There ain't gonna be no deals.

53:48.729 --> 53:50.649
Besides, I'm tired of
listening to your chatter!

53:58.405 --> 54:01.491
My pit ain't the only one on the juice.

54:01.617 --> 54:05.412
Come on, guys.
Hey, we ain't gotta fight, man.

54:15.422 --> 54:18.217
- Yeah. End of the line, assholes!

54:18.300 --> 54:20.219
- Goddamn it.

54:59.091 --> 55:01.009
That's got it.

55:01.093 --> 55:03.095
You the man, C.W.
You the man!

55:04.805 --> 55:07.724
Good God, Gerty!
What a gorge!

55:09.309 --> 55:11.520
We're right on schedule, buddy.

55:11.603 --> 55:14.189
Got a half hour before sunrise.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.902
- It's the fattest one l ever cracked.

55:35.502 --> 55:39.506
I'll take care of that.
Get one of the guys back here
and bag up the rest of this cash.

56:11.330 --> 56:14.291
What in God's name is going on up there?

56:27.221 --> 56:30.098
Get out of there!
Get out of there now, damn it!

56:49.409 --> 56:52.913
- What the hell was that all about?
- God Almighty.

57:00.504 --> 57:03.507
I think we're gonna have to make
a radical move here, Ray Bob.

57:03.715 --> 57:06.218
Now, I know this sounds totally insane...

57:06.301 --> 57:09.930
but I think Luther, C.W.
and Jesus...

57:10.013 --> 57:13.517
- What?
- Hey, look, if I don't go take a leak right now...

57:13.600 --> 57:15.519
I'm gonna piss in my pants.

57:32.619 --> 57:35.622
Sal, can you see anything
on top of that bank?

57:37.708 --> 57:40.294
I can't see anything up there.
Tear gas everywhere.

57:40.419 --> 57:44.798
Sal? Come in, Sal.

57:50.721 --> 57:53.891
- Sal?

57:54.016 --> 57:57.019
- Sal?

58:05.819 --> 58:10.616
Ray Bob, give me a hand
loading this green stuff.

58:15.913 --> 58:17.915
Shit.

58:19.416 --> 58:22.628
God Almighty.

58:22.711 --> 58:24.630
Where did Luther get off to?

58:24.713 --> 58:26.590
Uh, he's in the can.

58:26.715 --> 58:28.800
Let's get this stuff loaded.

58:39.394 --> 58:41.605
Let's get moving.
Cutting it pretty close.

59:17.808 --> 59:19.810
All right, you assholes.

59:19.893 --> 59:22.229
Get back here and give us
a hand loading this cash up.

59:22.312 --> 59:24.898
Hell, yeah.

59:38.620 --> 59:43.417
Jesus, I do believe you're the greediest
son of a bitch l ever knowed.

59:43.500 --> 59:46.628
- Where's Buck at?

59:46.795 --> 59:50.299
- Breathing down your neck.
- Take it back, Jesus.

59:50.424 --> 59:53.093
You're the second greediest
son of a bitch l ever knowed.

59:53.218 --> 59:55.512
It's not about the money,
you stupid bastard.

59:55.596 --> 59:58.432
Ray Bob, get over here.
You get away from them.

59:58.515 --> 01:00:01.310
Don't you cocksuckers move a muscle.

01:00:01.393 --> 01:00:06.523
I want you to drop your guns on the floor,
and l want you to kick 'em towards me.

01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:12.404
Oh, Bucky, what are you doing?

01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:16.408
They're vampires, Ray Bob. I know that
sounds fucked-up, but that's what they are.

01:00:16.491 --> 01:00:18.702
And we're getting the hell
out of here, Ray Bob.

01:00:18.827 --> 01:00:22.206
Even going to the pen's better than getting
killed by one of these bloodsuckers.

01:00:22.331 --> 01:00:25.626
Buck, you paranoid son of a bitch.

01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:30.214
Now, Ray Bob, even you, dumb fuck that
you are, ain't buying into this, right?

01:00:30.297 --> 01:00:33.926
Ray Bob, l wouldn't be willing to go out
there, if l didn't know what was in here...

01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:16.718
- Gettin' to you, boys. Get in there!

01:01:20.222 --> 01:01:23.517
- Now!

01:01:50.419 --> 01:01:53.297
Fuck.

01:02:03.724 --> 01:02:06.226
Hey!

01:02:06.310 --> 01:02:08.228
- Hey!

01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:13.692
Bucky.

01:02:13.817 --> 01:02:17.404
- Bucky.

01:02:27.206 --> 01:02:30.334
Bucky.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:41.011
- The doors!

01:02:50.729 --> 01:02:55.526
I never thought
I'd be happy to see you bastards.

01:02:57.819 --> 01:03:00.405
Do me a favor.

01:03:00.531 --> 01:03:02.699
Take that knife out of my leg.

01:03:07.704 --> 01:03:10.123
Hold it.
You gotta listen to me.

01:03:10.207 --> 01:03:12.626
You don't know what you're
dealing with in there.

01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:14.771
- Get this piece of shit out of my sight.
- Otis, listen to me!

01:03:14.795 --> 01:03:17.506
No, you listen to me! You had
your chance to talk, and you blew it.

01:03:17.631 --> 01:03:19.925
Now, goddamn it, the game's over!
Get him in there.

01:03:20.008 --> 01:03:22.928
I guarantee you it ain't over!
Otis, it ain't over!

01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:28.433
- Otis, listen to me! Otis!

01:03:28.517 --> 01:03:31.228
Otis, you gotta listen to me!
Otis!

01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:33.397
- Let's do it.
- Otis!

01:03:33.522 --> 01:03:35.899
- You don't know what it is in there!
- Go!

01:03:36.024 --> 01:03:37.901
You don't know what's in there!

01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:11.602
Goddamn it, Otis.
Now will you listen to me?

01:04:11.727 --> 01:04:14.396
Let me out of the fucking car, you asshole!

01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:40.506
Ah, shit!
We're toast!

01:04:46.094 --> 01:04:48.222
Otis, you got the sun!

01:04:48.305 --> 01:04:50.724
What are you waitin' on, man?
Go in there and kill 'em!

01:04:50.807 --> 01:04:53.894
I'm not sending any more men in there
to get slaughtered until l figure out...

01:04:54.019 --> 01:04:55.896
what the hell it is we're
dealing with here.

01:05:01.318 --> 01:05:05.322
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me!

01:05:39.606 --> 01:05:41.733
- Oh, shit!

01:08:47.211 --> 01:08:49.921
- Come here, you sexy bitch.

01:09:34.716 --> 01:09:37.135
You son of a bitch.
What the hell's going on here?

01:09:37.219 --> 01:09:42.015
- They're making happy meals out of our ass.
- They're goddamn vampires, Otis!

01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:48.313
All right, suppose they are.
What can we do about it?

01:09:48.397 --> 01:09:51.233
- I think l know a way we can take 'em out.
- Tell me.

01:09:51.316 --> 01:09:54.903
- You gotta uncuff me first.
- Well, you tell me, and we'll take 'em out.

01:09:55.028 --> 01:09:56.822
Get these cuffs off me now!

01:09:56.905 --> 01:09:59.199
- Fuck you. Come on, kid.
- Otis!

01:09:59.324 --> 01:10:02.035
- Fuck you.
- You take these cuffs off me, Otis!

01:10:02.119 --> 01:10:04.913
Otis!
Get these cuffs off me!

01:10:37.237 --> 01:10:39.698
No!

01:10:44.119 --> 01:10:47.706
All right, let's hear it.
And this better be good.

01:10:47.831 --> 01:10:52.127
You ain't hearing nothin'
until you get these cuffs off of me.

01:12:30.726 --> 01:12:33.770
Looks like it's just about over, Otis.

01:12:33.937 --> 01:12:36.315
Looks like you might be right, Luther.

01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:26.323
- Take that, you cocksucker.

01:14:26.717 --> 01:14:29.303
We'll take care of these pussies.

01:14:29.386 --> 01:14:31.722
Get the car loaded up.

01:14:55.329 --> 01:14:58.540
I was just gettin' the car ready.

01:15:00.417 --> 01:15:04.213
If you weren't already
dead, I'd kill your ass.

01:15:15.224 --> 01:15:19.102
- That's for the kid.

01:15:38.705 --> 01:15:41.917
Time to come with us, Buck.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.837
- The bite ain't that bad.
- Bite my ass.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.423
This is no time
for long good-byes, asshole.

01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:02.437
- Yeah!

01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:36.013
- Oh, man!

01:16:38.432 --> 01:16:40.893
- Boo!
- Shit!

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.400
Otis!

01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:10.506
- Fuck, your luck's done run out, Luther.

01:17:18.305 --> 01:17:21.225
Let's get the hell out of here
while we still got some dark left.

01:18:09.398 --> 01:18:13.402
You just don't ever give up,
do you, Bucky? l admire that.

01:18:19.241 --> 01:18:23.704
- Couldn't just go along
with the program, could you?

01:18:23.829 --> 01:18:27.916
- You had to be a hero!

01:18:28.041 --> 01:18:30.502
Had to play the old, tough cowboy, huh?

01:18:30.627 --> 01:18:34.131
- You had to fuck
everything up, didn't you?

01:18:34.214 --> 01:18:36.925
- What's wrong, tough guy?

01:18:40.304 --> 01:18:42.431
Happy trails!

01:18:47.227 --> 01:18:51.023
- How you feeling now, Bucky?
- Fuck.

01:19:54.795 --> 01:19:58.215
Jesus!

01:20:02.219 --> 01:20:05.138
You about gave me a heart attack, Otis.

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:08.141
Yeah.

01:20:16.692 --> 01:20:19.111
Nice shades.

01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:27.911
We're the goddamn fearless
vampire killers, ain't we, Otis?

01:20:31.206 --> 01:20:35.627
Yeah, too bad there ain't much call
for that kind of work.

01:20:35.711 --> 01:20:38.589
Yeah, l don't imagine.

01:20:43.719 --> 01:20:46.889
Tell me something, Buck.

01:20:46.972 --> 01:20:51.935
What in the hell are vampires
doing robbing a bank?

01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:55.731
You got me.

01:20:55.939 --> 01:20:59.401
I suppose vampires need money
just like anybody else.

01:21:02.237 --> 01:21:04.323
I guess.

01:21:06.617 --> 01:21:08.869
Nope.
Gave 'em up.

01:21:09.036 --> 01:21:11.538
Use one of those patches?

01:21:11.622 --> 01:21:15.417
- No. Cold turkey.
- Goddamn.

01:21:15.542 --> 01:21:17.711
- You ever miss 'em?
- Aw...

01:21:17.836 --> 01:21:21.298
every once in a while.

01:21:21.381 --> 01:21:25.010
After a good, hot cup of coffee...

01:21:25.135 --> 01:21:29.014
after a good meal and...
a good, hard fuck...

01:21:29.139 --> 01:21:32.142
but... not too often.

01:21:40.817 --> 01:21:44.196
Well, I think l might have
to make a run for it, Otis.

01:21:44.279 --> 01:21:47.741
I ain't never done too good
locked up in one of them cages.

01:21:47.824 --> 01:21:50.577
Spent too much of my
life like that already.

01:21:50.744 --> 01:21:54.414
Well, I suppose l ought
to try and stop you.

01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:58.335
I don't think you're in
no shape to stop nobody.

01:22:05.342 --> 01:22:09.513
- I don't imagine you're gonna make it.

01:22:09.638 --> 01:22:13.475
Maybe.
Maybe not
