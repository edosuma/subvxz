Don't ever say
that to me again.

08:54.066 --> 08:55.533

in the Bahamas.

strength, and that's admirable.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.533
You've never been to my home.
- No! I love it.

09:14.567 --> 09:16.467
- I'll give you a quick tour,
and then we'll...

09:16.500 --> 09:18.000
- So great.
- Go hang out.

09:18.033 --> 09:19.567
I won't take you outside,
'cause it's hot

09:19.600 --> 09:21.533
and dusty, but...
- Oh, but I love it out there.

09:21.567 --> 09:23.467
- It's very pretty.
It's a couple acres.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.066
So we'll have to have you
over some other time.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.467
- Oh, it's so much space.
It's amazing.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.567
- It's really nice.
This is the living room.

but whatever.

a whole bunch of sugar.

a good excuse.

09:56.633 --> 09:59.233
- Well, the director said
he can probably

09:59.266 --> 10:01.500

- Wow.

10:01.533 --> 10:03.500

I know you go to church,
so welcome to my chapel.

10:09.166 --> 10:11.166

Yeah.

10:19.367 --> 10:21.667
So tell me.
What's been going on?

10:21.700 --> 10:23.233
Did you have fun
in the Bahamas?

10:23.266 --> 10:25.033
Be honest.
- When you and I said, like,

10:25.066 --> 10:26.367
"Okay,
we're gonna let things go,"

10:26.400 --> 10:28.166
I was like, "Okay, we're gonna
let things go,"

10:28.200 --> 10:30.166
but I didn't think that you
and I were really gonna...

10:30.200 --> 10:32.133
- Let things go?
- But once we were there,

10:32.166 --> 10:33.700
we were having fun,
and I was like,

10:33.734 --> 10:36.300
"Okay,"
and then all this happened.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.100
- [snickering]

10:38.133 --> 10:40.533
Okay.
Where are you with everything?

10:40.567 --> 10:43.233
- Dorit and I were not in
a good place a month ago,

10:43.266 --> 10:46.266
because we have seen each other
at a couple public functions,

10:46.300 --> 10:48.266
and she ignored me,
which is fine.

10:48.300 --> 10:49.767
Whatever.
But Lisa Vanderpump

10:50.000 --> 10:51.567
knew there was tension
between Dorit and I.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.100
- Okay.
- So I get the call

10:54.133 --> 10:55.500
from Vanderpump Dogs.

10:55.533 --> 10:57.633
They said, "This thing happened
with Dorit and the dog.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.567
Can you believe it? It's crazy.
Lisa wanted you to know."

11:00.600 --> 11:02.767
- Lisa wanted you to know.
- Right.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.033
And I had
a very dramatic response,

11:05.066 --> 11:08.133
and I was kind of in it,

11:08.166 --> 11:10.266
texting with them,
being catty back and, like,

11:10.300 --> 11:11.767
"All right, well,
give me more deets."

11:12.000 --> 11:13.266
- I understand.
- "Show me the tea."

11:13.300 --> 11:17.300
Not being the most above-board
human being. Yes.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.767
- I knew that Teddi and Dorit
weren't best friends,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.567
but I didn't know that Teddi
really had it in for Dorit.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.233
- She fed me information.
I bit.

11:26.266 --> 11:27.767
- We should get the truth.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.133
What'd you do?
What'd you say?

11:30.166 --> 11:32.066
What were you almost gonna do?

11:32.100 --> 11:34.233
- Kyle might get invited
by Lisa Vanderpump

11:34.266 --> 11:36.567
to go to Vanderpump Dogs...
- For?

11:36.600 --> 11:38.000
- They wanted me to say it.

11:38.033 --> 11:40.633
I already know this going
into Vanderpump Dogs,

11:40.667 --> 11:43.000
and I couldn't
go through with it.

11:43.033 --> 11:45.166
- What did she want you
to go through with, baby?

11:45.200 --> 11:47.367
- Telling everybody
what Dorit did.

"I don't think you are
as innocent as you portray,"

I was proven right.

14:10.734 --> 14:13.367
that's what
she's doing right now.

- Somehow, some things
got misconstrued.

Now, there was a big argument
between Ken and John Cesar.

14:19.266 --> 14:20.700

14:24.333 --> 14:26.266

14:26.300 --> 14:29.233

doesn't matter. Tell whoever."

- Okay. Right. You told her.
But then you implicate me.

to them to tell me.

- From John Blizzard.

14:58.367 --> 14:59.734
that were not true.

14:59.767 --> 15:01.266

and I'm sorry for that.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.133

the (BLEEP) up.

15:09.133 --> 15:10.600
She doesn't work
for the center.

15:10.633 --> 15:13.233
- She doesn't, but she is very
involved with what we do, so...

15:13.266 --> 15:15.000
- Well, she might not be
anymore.

15:15.033 --> 15:16.367
I mean, she gave me
a really hard time,

15:16.400 --> 15:17.767
and that's really not fair.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.567

15:19.600 --> 15:22.166
is how this is being
all flipped onto you.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.233

unless you're sure

15:24.266 --> 15:25.633
I've said it...
- Exactly.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.567
- And I really mean that.
- I completely understand that.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.200

15:33.567 --> 15:35.200

Teddi was involved.

her favorite word.

25:22.767 --> 25:24.066

- Oh.

25:24.100 --> 25:25.233
- I literally never
go shopping.

25:25.266 --> 25:26.633

all your beauty routines.

- Yeah. I spend money on,

all your clothes?

just come out of your mouth.

28:19.233 --> 28:21.333
"I think the reason
I ended up with Teddi

28:21.367 --> 28:23.734
is because she's
trained horses for a living,

that to him,

take that as,

with my kids too."

- Whatever. Whatever.

Soft, slow, and sweet.

new adjustment.

to make the change.

he married was really sweet,

that he's married to now

42:20.667 --> 42:21.700
- Yes.

42:21.734 --> 42:23.200
- Sorry, well done!
[clapping]

42:23.233 --> 42:26.200
It's actually seeing
the light that Teddi

42:26.233 --> 42:28.166
has her little paw
in the cookie jar.

42:28.200 --> 42:30.000
Yes. Thank you, Dorit.

42:30.033 --> 42:31.367
- It's disgusting, by the way.
- Right--

42:31.400 --> 42:32.700
- It's all disgusting.
- It's disgusting.

42:32.734 --> 42:33.767
- Okay.
- So Teddi's hands

42:34.000 --> 42:35.166
are definitely
not clean in this.

42:35.200 --> 42:36.367
- I think that's the first time

42:36.400 --> 42:38.633
you've ever listened to me.

42:38.667 --> 42:41.033
- I'm getting one bit
of information

42:41.066 --> 42:42.367
and another bit
of information,

42:42.400 --> 42:44.367
and it's hard
to digest and process.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.700
- Well, you certainly didn't
get this bit of information,

42:46.734 --> 42:48.333
did you, Dorit?
- No, I didn't. No.

42:48.367 --> 42:52.166
- So somebody was guilty
by omission, right?

42:52.200 --> 42:54.233
- Teddi has led me to believe

42:54.266 --> 42:56.333
that it is Lisa Vanderpump
and only

42:56.367 --> 43:00.000
Lisa Vanderpump that
has any hand in all of this.

43:00.033 --> 43:04.633
- I did nothing wrong.
I am an honest person.

43:04.667 --> 43:06.667
Never once have I told a lie,

43:06.700 --> 43:09.333
and never will you ever
heard me tell one.

43:09.367 --> 43:12.734
- She's not as innocent
as she's claiming to be.

43:12.767 --> 43:14.333
- You thought you found it
a good home.

43:14.367 --> 43:16.100
The dog is safe now.

43:16.133 --> 43:18.333
Let's just
move forward from this.

43:24.066 --> 43:27.166
- Next on "The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"...

43:27.200 --> 43:31.433
- We're selling ass.
We're not selling cookies.

43:31.467 --> 43:34.700
- When you met him, was there,
like, instant attraction?

43:34.734 --> 43:36.667
- Well,
he has a very big penis.

43:36.700 --> 43:39.000
- [laughs] Okay, then.

43:39.033 --> 43:41.200
- I feel like I've got
two friends

43:41.233 --> 43:44.367
that were trying
to set me up to hurt me.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.433
- Don't trust anybody.

43:46.467 --> 43:48.734
- I was set up,
and I took the bait,

43:48.767 --> 43:50.734
but I could not
go through with it.

43:50.767 --> 43:53.233
- So you don't feel
any kind of guilt?

43:53.266 --> 43:55.033
- No. I feel betrayed by you.
- Okay.

43:55.066 --> 43:56.400
Well, I feel betrayed
by you too.

43:56.433 --> 43:58.233
- Oh, 'cause I couldn't carry
out your plan?

43:58.266 --> 43:59.700
- No.
- Sorry.

43:59.734 --> 44:02.233
[dramatic music]

44:02.266 --> 44:04.200
