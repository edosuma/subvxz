WEBVTT

00:13.514 --> 00:16.308
You see these seismic epicenters here?

00:16.308 --> 00:19.770
If we overlay the alien activity...

00:22.648 --> 00:25.400
The seismic activity took place
in the alien-free zones.

00:27.069 --> 00:28.570
Doctor Castillo's on the line.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.988
Let her wait.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.156
In the Amazon,

00:32.156 --> 00:35.035
the earthquakes emanated
from the alien activity.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.830
At the Idabel Projects,
the earthquakes emanated from the crater.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.249
Dear God.

00:40.999 --> 00:45.003
So, the alien-free zones
are most likely not free of aliens.

00:45.587 --> 00:50.217
We believe that each of these epicenters
is evidence of an active alien entity.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.261
But how?

00:52.886 --> 00:54.221
How is that possible?

00:54.805 --> 00:56.223
We would have seen them, no?

00:56.223 --> 00:59.309
Well, they can cloak their ships.
Our working theory is that they--

00:59.309 --> 01:00.894
They can cloak themselves?

01:02.354 --> 01:03.689
They could be anywhere.

01:06.024 --> 01:09.862
<i>Madam President, we wanted to make sure
you received our message about the entity.</i>

01:10.571 --> 01:12.656
<i>Prior to it being destroyed,
it revealed itself to be--</i>

01:12.656 --> 01:13.740
A portal.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.576
Yes, I received the report.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.287
From the scientist responsible
for destroying the asset.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.747
Mitsuki saved us, Madam President.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.000
She stopped the earthquakes.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.459
I need to speak to her.

01:24.459 --> 01:27.254
She's not... available.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.006
She's not available?

01:30.215 --> 01:33.719
We have aliens surrounding us.
People are dying. Food is running out.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.721
And Miss Yamato is not available?

01:35.721 --> 01:37.639
Not to talk, no.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.977
That's two of our best minds
lost on your watch.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.979
Plus the scientist that went in
before them.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.480
<i>Is that correct?</i>

01:56.283 --> 01:57.492
I need data from...

02:00.787 --> 02:02.414
Where did it go?

02:03.040 --> 02:05.584
The report. It was just here.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.338
There has to be a signature.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.423
A pattern.

02:11.423 --> 02:14.092
They're a network, a hive structure.

02:14.259 --> 02:17.179
They're a network, a hive structure.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.431
There's a signal somewhere.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.062
I can map it.

02:25.062 --> 02:28.732
If I can find a signal, I can track it...

02:48.877 --> 02:50.504
Are you okay?

02:52.965 --> 02:54.341
What do you want?

02:55.926 --> 02:57.386
I spoke to the president.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.765
They're not going to give us the data
from the other portals.

03:01.765 --> 03:05.143
Why? The entities are portals.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.355
An interconnected network
across the globe. We can map it.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.983
Their scientists are working on it.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.735
We all agree that you need to rest.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.904
And since we no longer have an asset...

03:18.532 --> 03:19.658
Mitsuki.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.536
I'm close to something. I can feel it.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.333
Sometimes a breakdown
can feel like a breakthrough.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.173
Rest.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.009
Please.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.277
Follow me.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.454
Rest.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.081
Okay.

04:08.707 --> 04:09.791
Rest.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.216
Follow me.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.676
Why?

04:23.722 --> 04:25.307
Follow me.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.991
Nothing...

04:43.534 --> 04:48.121
Nothing here... waste of time...

04:49.081 --> 04:51.625
A breakdown, just a...

04:58.757 --> 05:01.844
<i>Birds are attuned
to our planet's magnetic field.</i>

05:02.553 --> 05:05.264
I think the aliens
are connected to that field.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.809
<i>It's all interconnected.</i>

05:08.809 --> 05:11.019
Everything's connected, Mitsuki.

05:11.687 --> 05:12.771
<i>Even you.</i>

05:23.240 --> 05:24.533
Ground yourself.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.910
Ground yourself.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.663
...connected...

05:29.663 --> 05:33.333
...connected, all connected...

05:34.710 --> 05:35.836
To what?

05:41.049 --> 05:43.468
Connected to what?

05:43.719 --> 05:45.387
<i>Hello. Can you hear me?</i>

05:45.387 --> 05:47.181
<i>Everything's connected, Mitsuki.</i>

05:48.891 --> 05:50.517
<i>Someone there?</i>

05:55.105 --> 05:57.816
The boy... on the other side...

05:58.650 --> 06:00.903
He's the key.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.280
I have to find him.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.465
- Can you check this please?
- Okay, I'll check it now.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.675
I don't understand. We're losing him.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.427
- It's fine, damn it.
- I don't understand.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.221
We are losing him.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.098
- Try Epinephrine.
- Wake him up.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.099
Stand back.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.609
Hey. Look at me.

08:04.443 --> 08:06.445
- What's your name?
- Caspar Morrow.

08:06.445 --> 08:08.280
- Where are you?
- France.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.033
Okay. Stay with us. Stay with us.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.701
What happened?

08:16.622 --> 08:17.706
I saw a light.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.793
I saw a light
brighter than I've ever seen before.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.213
They attacked me this time, the aliens.

08:24.213 --> 08:27.674
And it was like the closer I got
to that light, they fought back.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.343
Must be something they want to protect?

08:29.343 --> 08:32.721
Can you find out what that place is?
What that light means?

08:32.721 --> 08:34.806
- I don't know.
- The WDC wants a map.

08:34.806 --> 08:35.890
It's not ready.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.894
Don't pressure them, Gabriel.

08:38.894 --> 08:41.563
I need to get back in there.
I need to find out what this place is.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.107
But what if you go into a coma
you can't wake up from?

08:44.107 --> 08:48.695
If that's what happens, then hopefully
I've hurt them as much as they hurt me.

08:48.695 --> 08:53.784
No. No one does anything
until I consult with the WDC. Understood?

09:26.775 --> 09:27.776
Hey.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.033
Thank you.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.541
What?

09:42.541 --> 09:46.170
If you don't find Sarah at the next place,
I will keep looking for her.

09:46.670 --> 09:47.754
We.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.674
We will keep looking for her.

09:51.341 --> 09:56.180
But I can't keep dragging you
all over the place, losing people.

09:58.265 --> 10:03.812
If something happens and I can't take Luke
with me, you would take care of him?

10:03.812 --> 10:05.981
- You don't have to ask.
- I have to.

10:06.690 --> 10:07.941
For myself.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.361
I would do the same with Ryder.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.779
I know you would.

10:14.948 --> 10:15.949
What?

10:19.453 --> 10:21.330
It's one of the best parts about you.

10:24.333 --> 10:27.503
Your strength, your will.

10:29.213 --> 10:31.048
The way you fight for what you love.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.010
I wish we had more time.

10:37.554 --> 10:38.972
Maybe we will, someday.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.353
Everyone, up and at 'em!

10:44.353 --> 10:46.313
Fifteen minutes to get our shit together

10:46.313 --> 10:48.607
and get this dog and pony show
on the road.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.401
Let's go find Sarah.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.535
It's okay, sweetie.

10:59.535 --> 11:02.079
The doctor just wants
to run a few more tests.

11:05.374 --> 11:06.625
Hey, Sarah.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.710
I want my mom.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.088
I know, sweetheart. I know.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.466
I wanna talk to you again about the shard.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.760
I already told you everything.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.887
Maybe there's something you forgot.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.098
It's really important
that we know everything.

11:21.098 --> 11:23.225
Why don't you try to remember?

11:23.225 --> 11:24.434
Anything at all.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.945
I think my brother knows
how to talk to it.

11:36.822 --> 11:41.076
- What do you mean, "talk to it"?
- Not talk but feel things.

11:42.077 --> 11:43.370
Feel things?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.330
When can I see my mom?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.001
We are trying our best to find her.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.799
We just wanna make sure that artifact
didn't have an effect on you.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.426
It won't take long.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.721
Up you go. Okay.

12:08.353 --> 12:11.815
There's like ten different tube stations
and no tracks in between 'em.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.193
And you all went to the same place?

12:15.444 --> 12:16.862
What about his drawings?

12:16.862 --> 12:18.030
Is that the light?

12:18.030 --> 12:19.323
Yeah.

12:20.532 --> 12:23.493
These are all bits and pieces
of that place.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.371
I mean, it won't mean anything to anyone
that hasn't been there.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.082
I need to get back there.
I need to figure out what this is.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.584
Put the pieces together.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.961
Are you sure the enfants can't help you
while you're in there?

12:32.961 --> 12:34.463
Ten different tube stations.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.051
And Prisha's been hearing another voice.

12:39.051 --> 12:40.219
Right, Prisha?

12:40.219 --> 12:43.305
Yes, we can all hear the other.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.182
Wait. What other?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.101
There's someone else out there.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.479
Someone they've been communicating with.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.231
We need to find out who that is.

12:52.231 --> 12:53.565
Maybe they can help.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.735
Anything from the WDC?

12:56.735 --> 12:58.195
We have a meeting now.

12:58.862 --> 13:02.032
You know how I feel about this, Caspar,
but it'll be up to them.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.496
<i>She doesn't want me to go back in.</i>

13:07.496 --> 13:10.499
But, I mean, she is a doctor, bro.
Maybe she knows what she's talking about.

13:10.499 --> 13:13.252
Yeah, but how is taking care of me
gonna help anyone else?

13:13.252 --> 13:14.920
It's helping you, innit?

13:14.920 --> 13:17.881
What if I go with you
the next time you go under?

13:17.881 --> 13:20.008
That way I can keep you tethered
to our world.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.426
Hold up. What do you mean?

13:21.426 --> 13:23.136
I mean, how would you even do that?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.721
The doctors can put me under.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.891
I saw Casp in my dreams.
That's how we found him.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.935
He was there with me
and with the aliens too.

13:29.935 --> 13:32.479
- And what if you never wake up?
- I will.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.773
It's just dreams.

13:34.773 --> 13:38.652
And, anyway, Casp said that seeing me
in his mind is what kept him in our world.

13:38.652 --> 13:41.530
So maybe that's our best weapon
against the aliens.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.409
- And you're all right with that, mate?
- Hey! It's my decision.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.828
Not his or anyone else's.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.414
Maybe that's what they want.
What he wants.

13:50.414 --> 13:52.541
- You on the other side with them.
- Hey!

13:53.250 --> 13:55.294
- I'm not on their side!
- You know he's not.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.921
Do I? We all know Caspar is not the same.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.174
I'm sorry, mate, but it's true.
And you know it as well.

14:00.174 --> 14:02.718
We've all had
our little side conversations about it.

14:03.302 --> 14:06.763
I know that you're risking your life
every time you go...

14:06.763 --> 14:08.390
well, wherever it is you go.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.601
But there's no reason
to drag another person into this.

14:10.601 --> 14:12.311
I know what this is about, mate.

14:12.978 --> 14:15.772
It's not about me being an alien,
or me being with them.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.441
It's about you being with her.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.569
Because you love Jamila,
and that's all right.

14:20.569 --> 14:24.323
But you don't have to take it out on me
just because she doesn't love you back!

14:32.039 --> 14:34.208
The WDC says you can do it.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.337
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, Pen.

14:38.337 --> 14:39.463
We're all good.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.115
This Project Idabel?

15:07.115 --> 15:10.202
We're not expecting anyone here today.
Who's the POC?

15:10.202 --> 15:11.453
General Mitchell.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.872
We're from Camp Pierce in Colorado.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.374
We got raided by Movement members.

15:15.374 --> 15:18.961
They took all of our weapons, ammo.
They killed half my company.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.129
Then we heard the hunter-killers
were coming from Wyoming.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.506
I decided to get us out of there.

15:22.506 --> 15:24.842
It's the closest live military base
I could find.

15:24.842 --> 15:27.719
We're completely exposed in that area.
Dead meat, if you will.

15:28.804 --> 15:30.556
I need everyone's IDs.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.058
Theirs were stolen.

15:34.142 --> 15:37.229
I still have mine because it wasn't on me
when they raided us.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.111
Security breach. Security breach.
Section F.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.029
Again.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.200
The hell's that?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.536
Front One, Front Nine, can you hear me?

15:52.536 --> 15:56.081
Copy, over. I need backup
on the southeast side. Now. Now.

15:56.081 --> 15:58.250
- How many soldiers in the back?
- I've got about ten.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.586
Head over to the base.
Center of town, you can't miss it.

16:00.586 --> 16:03.338
Get them all checked in, prepped,
in case we need 'em.

16:14.099 --> 16:15.726
How much further to the facility?

16:15.726 --> 16:18.729
Four miles.
Unless this bozo is leading us astray.

16:18.729 --> 16:21.231
Look, I saw the plans.
If they've changed, I wouldn't know.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.774
What if Sarah's not there?

16:23.859 --> 16:25.694
- She's there.
- How you know that?

16:26.278 --> 16:27.446
The shard.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.199
I can feel it.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.659
If it's there, she's there.

16:35.996 --> 16:40.292
We've got two of the assailants
in the field, both in uniform. DOA.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.794
Can't find anyone else, yet.

16:43.295 --> 16:44.379
Keep everyone at home.

16:44.379 --> 16:47.132
Leave the civil defense system on
until further notice.

16:47.132 --> 16:49.009
Secure all assets.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.427
Sir.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.499
<i>This boy, did you know him?</i>

17:20.499 --> 17:21.875
<i>He wasn't a memory?</i>

17:21.875 --> 17:24.461
If you hadn't seen him before,

17:25.170 --> 17:27.923
what do you think happened
if it wasn't in your mind?

17:29.049 --> 17:31.051
It was in theirs.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.637
I was in theirs.

17:35.681 --> 17:37.599
Open your mind...

17:39.059 --> 17:41.270
Break through...

17:41.270 --> 17:43.772
Break... through...

17:43.772 --> 17:46.191
Let it all in.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.134
I'm sorry.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.471
For what I said.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.016
How I said what I said.

18:19.892 --> 18:22.394
I owe you more than that.
I owe you a "thank you."

18:23.312 --> 18:25.939
You traveled a fucking continent.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.275
And you risked...

18:31.612 --> 18:32.613
for me. And--

18:33.322 --> 18:34.489
I'm sorry.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.242
- I'm gratef--
- I didn't do it for you.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.577
So no thanks needed.

18:39.620 --> 18:40.954
And no apology either.

18:41.830 --> 18:43.123
You were right.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.543
About my feelings.

18:49.421 --> 18:52.758
Look, if you wanna keep risking your life,
go ahead. I don't care.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.636
But I care about hers.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.554
I care about her.

18:59.056 --> 19:01.391
And listen, this whole world?
It's all shite.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.268
And to be honest,

19:03.268 --> 19:06.730
I don't even know what's left
to fight for anymore, except her.

19:06.730 --> 19:10.275
So if you care,
I mean, even just a little,

19:10.275 --> 19:14.196
then you'll know I'm right, and you'll do
the only thing you can for her right now.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.326
Let go.

19:42.516 --> 19:44.017
Hey. We'll be back.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.644
Take you to your family.

19:46.728 --> 19:47.729
Let's go!

20:03.328 --> 20:04.329
Hi.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.166
There's something out there.

20:09.501 --> 20:10.836
I don't know what it is.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.174
It feels different.

20:15.883 --> 20:20.012
Tired of always prepping to fight
but not allowed to. What is the point?

20:21.263 --> 20:22.681
When are you gonna trust me?

20:24.308 --> 20:27.186
You're his backup.
That's your role in this fight.

20:28.604 --> 20:29.605
You up for it?

20:31.690 --> 20:34.193
There's no one in this group
I trust more than you.

20:34.902 --> 20:35.986
Okay.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.113
We head down in V-formation.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.949
Looking for a water pump
on the outer ring of the base.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.702
If the corporal's right,
we're pretty close.

20:43.702 --> 20:45.954
Stay low and stick with your partner.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.249
They're your lifeline.

20:51.752 --> 20:52.753
Here.

20:53.587 --> 20:54.713
Stay with Ryder.

20:57.049 --> 20:58.050
I love you.

20:59.593 --> 21:00.677
I love you too.

21:25.285 --> 21:28.956
<i>All units mobilize.
Repeat. All units mobilize.</i>

21:32.209 --> 21:34.795
All right, the rest of you. Go, go, go!

22:35.439 --> 22:36.773
We need more men.

22:46.783 --> 22:49.119
Easy. Good choice.

23:01.757 --> 23:02.758
Keep watch.

23:12.184 --> 23:15.020
...stand by. We'll give you a status report.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.522
<i>Roger that, Bravo Two.</i>

23:18.023 --> 23:20.025
<i>Do we have contact topside?</i>

23:24.071 --> 23:26.156
Topside, we're on the move right now.

23:26.156 --> 23:28.242
We'll give you a sitrep
as soon as we get there.

23:28.242 --> 23:29.493
<i>Copy that, Bravo Two.</i>

24:09.408 --> 24:12.160
Sarah. Sarah, honey.

24:14.663 --> 24:16.290
- Hey.
- Hello?

24:16.290 --> 24:17.749
Hey.

24:19.001 --> 24:20.002
Who are you?

24:20.002 --> 24:22.212
Two citizens looking for their loved ones.

24:25.424 --> 24:26.758
You're not military.

24:29.303 --> 24:31.221
Your boots are bloused too low.

24:31.930 --> 24:33.015
Who are you?

24:35.017 --> 24:37.853
Who's that you were calling for? Sarah?

24:39.229 --> 24:40.606
Long brown hair?

24:41.315 --> 24:43.108
About this tall? Eight or nine?

24:49.823 --> 24:52.784
- You know where she is?
- They brought her here yesterday.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.329
I can help you find her. Who are you with?

24:56.330 --> 24:58.123
- The Movement.
- Okay.

24:58.123 --> 25:02.419
Let us out, 'cause we're fighting
the same fight, okay?

25:05.005 --> 25:06.507
Hey, hey, hey.

25:06.507 --> 25:09.384
What do you think we're doing on this side
of a military lockup? Come on.

25:18.268 --> 25:20.896
Stand back, both of you.

25:22.439 --> 25:23.482
Don't move.

25:42.084 --> 25:44.586
I think she's in the medical wing,
your girl.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.129
And I can show you, okay?

25:50.717 --> 25:51.760
Come on.

26:00.143 --> 26:01.854
- Oh, shit.
- Hey!

26:04.982 --> 26:06.233
Fuck. Shit!

26:09.945 --> 26:12.197
- I want my mom! I want my mom!
- We have to go.

26:14.491 --> 26:15.993
Give me the gun. I'm a better shot.

26:21.498 --> 26:24.209
Hey, listen. If you wanna find her,
you have to give me the gun.

26:24.209 --> 26:27.504
I was a Navy SEAL.
Four tours, sniper trained.

26:27.504 --> 26:28.755
I'm the best shot you've got.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.132
Intruder, sector 3!

26:36.096 --> 26:39.057
When I give the word, you're gonna run.
They'll have your daughter on the move.

26:39.057 --> 26:41.685
We'll stay here,
hold them off as long as we can.

26:42.352 --> 26:43.353
Good?

26:55.240 --> 26:57.242
Careful, careful. Stay with me.

26:57.242 --> 26:59.119
Transporting subject to safe area.

26:59.119 --> 27:00.454
<i>Copy that.</i>

27:05.042 --> 27:06.043
Sarah.

27:07.211 --> 27:09.296
Stay with me. Stay with me.

27:27.773 --> 27:29.483
Don't shoot! Please!

27:31.818 --> 27:33.612
Where is my daughter?

27:37.366 --> 27:38.825
Time to go! Go, go, go!

28:24.663 --> 28:28.584
Sarah, it's Mommy!
Don't move! I'll get you!

28:28.834 --> 28:30.419
Get back!

28:40.387 --> 28:43.056
Drop the gun and step away from the girl.

29:27.267 --> 29:28.268
Billy.

29:42.741 --> 29:44.493
I apologized to Monty.

29:46.995 --> 29:48.872
He was right about you going with me.

29:53.919 --> 29:54.920
Casp,

29:55.712 --> 29:58.715
I keep making this choice.

29:59.967 --> 30:04.179
In the bus, before we crashed,
before we even knew they were here.

30:05.180 --> 30:09.101
Back home, when I left my family
in the Channel.

30:09.101 --> 30:13.063
When I convinced our friends
to press on looking for you.

30:15.357 --> 30:16.567
In the hospital

30:18.026 --> 30:19.027
where we found you.

30:22.739 --> 30:23.866
And Monty's right.

30:25.868 --> 30:27.995
There is something different
about you now.

30:28.787 --> 30:30.789
And it's not that I don't recognize you.

30:31.915 --> 30:35.961
It's that you don't recognize
parts of yourself and it terrifies me.

30:36.795 --> 30:42.050
'Cause I can see the in-between
like it's reflected in your eyes.

30:45.053 --> 30:49.057
But I keep making the same choice
to stick with you.

30:50.392 --> 30:51.977
Then I'm the wrong choice, Jam.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.940
I don't know where it all begins
and where it ends,

30:56.940 --> 30:59.234
but I don't want you to get hurt.

30:59.234 --> 31:03.030
I didn't come looking for you
so you could disappear again.

31:05.449 --> 31:07.576
I didn't ask you to come looking for me.

31:11.455 --> 31:12.873
So, that's it then?

31:14.249 --> 31:17.252
You just want me to let you go?

31:19.755 --> 31:20.756
Would you?

32:13.809 --> 32:14.810
Mitsuki?

32:20.691 --> 32:22.109
Have you seen Mitsuki?

32:22.776 --> 32:24.945
Been hours since I saw her.

32:28.782 --> 32:30.701
- Shit!
- Where's Mitsuki?

32:30.701 --> 32:32.911
I don't know, we haven't seen her.
But, Maya, look.

32:32.911 --> 32:36.373
The ship. It's activated
like it's communicating again.

32:36.373 --> 32:40.377
- It's not coming from there.
- Maybe the sky? Another ship?

33:19.416 --> 33:21.043
Connected...

33:21.043 --> 33:23.212
It's all connected...

33:23.212 --> 33:27.382
If I can let them into my head,
I can get into theirs...

33:28.717 --> 33:31.553
Be one with the hive...

33:41.730 --> 33:44.274
Be one with the hive...

33:44.858 --> 33:47.152
One with them.

33:47.986 --> 33:50.280
One with them...

33:57.496 --> 33:59.164
The light...

33:59.164 --> 34:00.999
Follow the light...

34:00.999 --> 34:03.335
To the other side.

34:23.730 --> 34:26.358
The other side.

35:23.081 --> 35:24.082
Hello?

35:43.018 --> 35:44.144
Hello?

35:46.188 --> 35:47.189
Hello?

35:49.358 --> 35:50.442
Can you hear me?

35:52.694 --> 35:53.779
Where are you?

35:56.990 --> 35:58.116
You're him.

35:59.743 --> 36:00.827
The boy.

36:03.664 --> 36:04.706
Who are you?

36:04.706 --> 36:05.791
I saw you.

36:07.668 --> 36:08.836
Through the portal.

36:10.170 --> 36:11.338
David Bowie.

36:14.007 --> 36:15.676
Someone called me that once.

36:25.185 --> 36:26.186
Are you--

36:29.231 --> 36:30.566
Are you real?

36:32.317 --> 36:33.569
What else would I be?

36:34.278 --> 36:35.279
One of them?

36:39.825 --> 36:40.868
I'm real.

36:52.546 --> 36:53.714
What is this place?

36:55.591 --> 36:56.800
It's where my mind goes...

36:58.719 --> 36:59.803
when I'm connected.

37:03.473 --> 37:04.641
To them?

37:05.601 --> 37:08.395
Today, I heard they're a hive.

37:09.771 --> 37:10.856
All one.

37:11.857 --> 37:12.858
One mind.

37:13.650 --> 37:14.651
So, this is...

37:16.820 --> 37:18.071
Where they connect.

37:39.635 --> 37:40.677
I know where we've been.

37:40.677 --> 37:41.762
Mitsuki!

37:44.306 --> 37:46.308
I know where the portals go.

37:46.308 --> 37:47.768
The mother ship.
