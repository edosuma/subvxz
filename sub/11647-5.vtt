38:20.520 --> 38:22.113
It's a dead end!

38:41.520 --> 38:42.669
(SCRAPING)

38:42.720 --> 38:45.678
(THUDDING ON WALL)

39:09.960 --> 39:12.998
(DOOR RATTLES)

39:33.120 --> 39:35.236
I think he's gone. Argh!

39:35.280 --> 39:38.591
(NAIL GUN FIRES REPEATEDLY)

39:38.640 --> 39:41.075
(NAIL GUN SHOTS ECHO)

40:12.800 --> 40:13.835
Well...

40:13.880 --> 40:15.314
nailed to the floor.

40:15.360 --> 40:17.920
- That's a first.
- Speak for yourself.

40:17.960 --> 40:21.590
School play, Crucifixion re-enactment
gone badly awry.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.074
(CHUCKLES)

40:44.360 --> 40:45.953
Hi.

40:49.560 --> 40:50.834
Hi.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.159
Help!

41:01.200 --> 41:02.235
Hi!

41:02.280 --> 41:04.157
Hello? Hi!

41:08.320 --> 41:09.719
Oh!

41:09.760 --> 41:11.990
You're electro girl,
me doppelgänger's looking for you.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.077
He wants to speak to you
about a jumper or something.

41:14.120 --> 41:16.589
What are you doing?

41:16.640 --> 41:17.835
<i>I...</i> I know it's a big ask,

41:17.880 --> 41:22.078
but is there any chance at all that
you could pull these nails out of us?

41:22.120 --> 41:23.269
I'm...

41:23.320 --> 41:25.596
on my way to a job, <i>so...</i>

41:25.640 --> 41:27.950
"I'm on my way to a job."

41:28.000 --> 41:30.435
That's what the Good Samaritan said
to Jesus when he found him

41:30.480 --> 41:32.073
nailed to the Cross, but do you know what?

41:32.120 --> 41:33.349
He friggin' un-nailed him

41:33.400 --> 41:35.960
and then he said, "Do you want to kip
in me stable with that donkey

41:36.000 --> 41:38.196
"from... Bethlehem?"

41:38.240 --> 41:40.516
And Jesus said...
Do you know what he said? He went,

41:40.560 --> 41:43.120
"Oh, cheers, mate.
See that water over there?

41:43.160 --> 41:44.639
"I'm gonna turn that into wine.

41:46.160 --> 41:47.195
"And fish."

41:47.240 --> 41:48.833
You really know your Bible, don't you?

41:48.880 --> 41:50.314
Me faith's very important to me.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.351
For fuck's sake.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.232
Whoa, careful, careful, careful.

41:56.280 --> 41:57.953
Come with me.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.877
- Don't.
- You can do this!

42:01.320 --> 42:03.072
I'll be with you.

42:17.040 --> 42:18.189
Come on.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.830
Don't worry,
there's nothing to be scared of.

42:24.880 --> 42:26.632
Nobody's going to hurt you.

42:26.680 --> 42:28.591
Get off my monkey, you crazy bitch!

42:28.640 --> 42:31.598
- Leave her alone!
- What happened?

42:31.640 --> 42:36.032
She has been inserting herself into you,
dude, and not in a fucking "I'm not gay,

42:36.080 --> 42:38.799
"I just want to know how it feels"
kind of way, neither.

42:38.840 --> 42:40.239
I'll handle this.

42:40.280 --> 42:43.193
I think you'll find
she's already been handled.

42:43.240 --> 42:44.230
By me.

42:46.680 --> 42:48.193
In there.

43:05.760 --> 43:08.195
Can I just say in my defence...
Just don't, just stop!

43:08.240 --> 43:10.595
Jess! Please, just...
There are things

43:10.640 --> 43:12.438
I need to tell you and I just...

43:12.480 --> 43:13.914
You need to listen.

43:13.960 --> 43:16.270
The business with the defecation,

43:16.320 --> 43:18.391
perhaps that was an error <i>of...</i>
No, it was,

43:18.440 --> 43:20.511
it was an error of judgment on my part,

43:20.560 --> 43:25.077
but my motives,
they were true and bloody noble.

43:27.240 --> 43:29.595
Watching you defecate your guts out,

43:29.640 --> 43:31.392
it didn't put me off you at all.

43:31.440 --> 43:32.589
At all!

43:32.640 --> 43:35.393
There is no greater test
of a man's feelings.

43:35.440 --> 43:38.193
I have seen you turn shit-ugly.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.315
But...

43:42.320 --> 43:43.754
But to me, it was shit beautiful.

43:43.800 --> 43:45.074
You are...

43:45.120 --> 43:47.270
You're a beautiful shitter.

43:57.000 --> 43:57.990
What?

44:16.720 --> 44:18.119
Hang on, hang on.

44:19.440 --> 44:21.716
It's not just a one-off thing, is it?
I mean...

44:23.840 --> 44:26.912
You are going to be my girlfriend,
aren't you?

44:28.440 --> 44:29.953
I'll be your girlfriend.

44:31.480 --> 44:32.754
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45:02.240 --> 45:03.435
<i>Oh...</i>

45:03.480 --> 45:04.675
<i>Um...</i>

45:04.720 --> 45:06.996
I... I'm sorry... Urn...

45:07.040 --> 45:10.920
Last week, you shocked me
and you restarted my heart.

45:10.960 --> 45:13.759
I didn't look like this,
I was an 80-year-old man,

45:13.800 --> 45:15.120
I had senile dementia.

45:15.160 --> 45:17.151
That was you?

45:17.200 --> 45:19.874
Yeah, I just... I didn't get chance
to say thank you or anything and...

45:22.960 --> 45:24.359
Thank you.

45:32.200 --> 45:34.237
Ooh! No, can I just?

45:34.280 --> 45:36.840
I'm sorry to bother you,
it's about a jumper.

45:36.880 --> 45:39.269
Are you some kind of knitwear salesman?

45:40.320 --> 45:41.799
I've seen the future.

45:42.960 --> 45:45.873
And I think it might be your future.

45:50.320 --> 45:51.469
So what happens to me?

45:53.160 --> 45:55.276
I think you become a proper superhero.

45:59.240 --> 46:01.754
It's a support group for terminally ill
young people.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.791
I'm one of their care assistants.

46:03.840 --> 46:05.274
It's not fucking fair.

46:06.320 --> 46:07.310
What can you do?

46:07.360 --> 46:09.033
Yes!

46:09.080 --> 46:11.435
Fuck you, you fucking loser!

46:12.720 --> 46:14.154
Holding someone, <i>it...</i>

46:14.200 --> 46:15.952
It makes me feel alive.

46:16.000 --> 46:16.990
(GASPS FOR AIR)

46:17.040 --> 46:18.553
What's going on?

46:18.600 --> 46:20.830
I don't know what's going on with him.

46:20.880 --> 46:22.678
I've got something for you.

46:22.720 --> 46:24.836
Yeah?

46:26.160 --> 46:28.071
This has been a good day.

46:28.120 --> 46:29.394
Yeah, it has been a good day.
