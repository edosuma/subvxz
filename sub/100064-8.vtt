WEBVTT

00:08.408 --> 00:09.510
Dad's one of them.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.411
I think he always was.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.013
We were created
from eggs.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.481
We came from you.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.516
And that makes you...

00:15.549 --> 00:16.683
Your mother.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.019
Abraham Van Helsing.

00:19.052 --> 00:20.621
Some pages, they're gone.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.256
Find the pages,
open the portal.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.291
Only then you can kill
the Dark One.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.493
Dracula.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.694
Run when you can.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.096
Find the pages.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.330
Take my hand.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.634
Nobody with my family!

00:34.468 --> 00:48.649
[screaming]

00:48.682 --> 00:49.750
Run.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.419
Find those pages and go!

00:54.388 --> 00:56.223
Go! Run!

00:56.256 --> 00:57.224
Come on, Jack!

00:57.257 --> 00:58.225
I need you to go!

00:58.258 --> 00:59.526
Now!

00:59.560 --> 01:01.094
Run, Violet. Run.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.433
What has become of you?

01:07.200 --> 01:10.704
So many years hiding
amongst their kind.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.273
You have taken
on their weakness.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.678
You've seen what
I've seen.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.479
I've sensed it.

01:19.513 --> 01:20.714
Bathory.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.349
Her betrayal.

01:22.382 --> 01:24.351
Her failure.

01:26.620 --> 01:35.162
All our plans... just...
gone to the wind.

01:35.195 --> 01:37.364
If you know where
they are...

01:38.732 --> 01:41.034
My children?

01:41.068 --> 01:44.504
If I did, don't you think
I would have been there?

01:47.074 --> 01:49.343
You cannot waver now,
Willem.

01:49.376 --> 01:55.515
Our hope, our destiny, it is all
still within our grasp.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.050
How?

01:57.084 --> 01:59.353
We're back to where we began.

01:59.386 --> 02:02.189
The portal is sealed,
the Dark One with it,

02:02.222 --> 02:04.725
the fourth elder wasted, yes.

02:04.758 --> 02:09.463
But we will create another one.

02:09.496 --> 02:13.567
Or find a different way.

02:15.435 --> 02:19.706
For hundreds of years
I've waited for this chance

02:19.740 --> 02:21.708
and now it's lost.

02:21.742 --> 02:26.813
Do not forget who you are
and why you were made.

02:26.847 --> 02:30.617
The Dark One chose you
to be strong like us.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.720
We must never lose faith
in the darkness.

02:33.754 --> 02:37.891
Only together now can we make
right what has been done.

02:37.924 --> 02:40.160
Together?

02:40.193 --> 02:41.161
She's betrayed you twice.

02:41.194 --> 02:44.665
How do you know
she won't do it again?

02:44.698 --> 02:46.433
Bathory.

02:46.466 --> 02:49.169
She is a means to an end.

02:49.202 --> 02:52.906
A blunt tool that I will use
and then discard.

02:52.939 --> 02:55.842
When she returns,
the Dark One will know

02:55.876 --> 02:58.645
who has been faithful
and who has not.

02:58.679 --> 03:02.315
She will pluck the weak
and disloyal from her breast

03:02.349 --> 03:05.752
and drown them
in their own blood.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.855
Bathory's fate
is all but sealed.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.792
But yours.

03:11.825 --> 03:15.829
Yours rests in your own hands.

03:27.307 --> 03:36.149
[speaking Latin]

03:37.217 --> 03:40.153
Whatever plan you and
my father had, it's over.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.888
Not over.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.757
Never over.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.631
How does it feel to know
the truth?

03:51.665 --> 03:57.804
That the man who raised you
only did so to sacrifice you?

03:57.838 --> 04:00.474
He's dead to me.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.477
Such dark emotion.

04:03.510 --> 04:09.182
That hatred could prove useful.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.918
I'm never gonna help you
find Violet.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.321
You might as well
just kill me now.

04:14.354 --> 04:15.922
Why do something so reckless

04:15.956 --> 04:20.494
when you still have
so much potential?

04:30.403 --> 04:31.605
[pleading]
Please.

04:31.638 --> 04:37.778
If I cannot bend you to my will,
perhaps your father can.

04:37.811 --> 04:38.678
No, no!

04:38.712 --> 04:39.513
No!

04:39.546 --> 04:40.680
No!

04:40.714 --> 04:44.651
[screaming]

04:45.385 --> 04:55.328
[screaming]

05:09.843 --> 05:12.646
What was it like?

05:12.679 --> 05:13.880
Hawaii?

05:13.914 --> 05:15.549
Mmmhmm.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.751
Everything people said.

05:17.784 --> 05:20.720
Paradise.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.589
Why'd you leave?

05:22.622 --> 05:24.958
Dad was in the air force.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.328
If he got posted at a base
for more than a few years,

05:28.361 --> 05:33.300
Philippines, Dakota, Germany...

05:33.333 --> 05:36.403
happiest time of my life
is when we were stationed
at Hickam.

05:39.339 --> 05:43.276
There was a beach half a mile
from our billet.

05:43.310 --> 05:46.880
Waves like I'd never seen.

05:46.913 --> 05:52.686
My friends and I, we'd surf
until the sun went down.

05:52.719 --> 05:56.423
Burned skin, jellyfish stings.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.425
It didn't matter.

05:58.458 --> 06:02.629
The biggest worry I had
was being late for dinner.

06:02.662 --> 06:04.998
Then you ended up
at Fort Collins.

06:05.031 --> 06:05.765
Yeah.

06:05.799 --> 06:10.036
Right before the rising.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.939
The day the vampires happened

06:12.973 --> 06:17.344
mom was visiting family
down south.

06:17.377 --> 06:21.314
Dad couldn't reach her
so he took a Jeep

06:21.348 --> 06:25.785
and went out after her.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.922
That was the last time
I ever saw him.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.630
The guy who owned this place
took me in.

06:36.663 --> 06:44.638
Gave me a job, handed me the
keys right before he passed.

06:44.671 --> 06:48.341
There's a world out there
that's still okay.

06:48.375 --> 06:52.512
My dad keeps it all a secret
but at the base

06:52.545 --> 06:55.715
people come and go
from somewhere.

06:55.749 --> 07:02.989
Maybe your dad found your mom
and they got to where it's safe.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.525
My sister, too.

07:06.893 --> 07:09.362
You never know, right?

07:10.530 --> 07:12.032
Lee?

07:16.636 --> 07:18.838
Hey.

07:18.872 --> 07:23.743
I didn't mean to upset you.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.513
One day maybe you
and me can sneak off.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.450
What're you talking about?

07:30.483 --> 07:33.053
Well, I've heard there's
a coyote that takes people

07:33.086 --> 07:36.423
out to some place safe.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.459
Hell, maybe we can make it all
the way back to my beach.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.094
Teach you how to hang ten.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.430
How do we find this coyote?

07:43.463 --> 07:46.466
Talk around the bar is that
they pick people up

07:46.499 --> 07:51.037
from an old bus station out on
Highway 12, near Pennington.

07:51.071 --> 07:56.109
Could all be bullshit but
if you don't have a dream...

07:58.078 --> 07:59.546
Hey.

07:59.579 --> 08:00.780
What's your rush?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.148
I've got work.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.651
And you've got a dad
that will kill me

08:04.684 --> 08:07.087
if he finds out about us.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.057
And you still haven't
settled your tab.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.092
Mmm.

08:12.125 --> 08:17.464
Maybe I settle up by buying
our way to Hawaii?

08:20.600 --> 08:21.868
Yeah.

08:22.902 --> 08:24.738

would have wanted.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.286
Why don't you just tell me?

Because if I tell you
they'll pull it out of you.

15:56.489 --> 15:57.623

16:17.243 --> 16:19.245
‐Hey!
‐Shh!

16:19.278 --> 16:20.580
Hey!

16:23.483 --> 16:25.418
You wanna know the truth?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.988
Here it is.

16:29.021 --> 16:32.692
He's a lying sack of shit
that never loved us.

16:34.427 --> 16:37.396
I'd rather die than give
you anything.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.298
One day my sister's gonna
find you

16:39.332 --> 16:42.902
and I hope she doesn't flinch
when she takes your head.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.371
I just wish I could be there
to see it.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.411
You okay?

16:52.445 --> 16:57.950
I... it's a lot to take in,
you know?

16:57.984 --> 17:01.587
You and your sister being what
you say you are.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.322
Your dad.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.526
This mother you never knew
you had is gone?

17:06.559 --> 17:08.494
How do you think it is for me?

17:08.528 --> 17:10.129
I didn't seek this out.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.465
Any of it.

17:12.498 --> 17:16.168
Everything just...
landed on me.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.704
All at once.

17:18.738 --> 17:22.174
I'm sorry, Vi.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.276
Not your fault.

17:23.309 --> 17:27.346
No, I mean... you wanted me
to run away with you,

17:27.380 --> 17:30.182
to get away from Fort Collins.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.152
I didn't know what
you were up against.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.621
Why'd you come after me?

17:35.655 --> 17:39.559
All we said about Hawaii?

17:39.592 --> 17:44.297
It wasn't just pillow talk.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.500
I was afraid to take a risk.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.435
To commit to something.

17:49.468 --> 17:51.504
To us.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.779
I don't wanna hide anymore.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.494
This was my mother's.

18:15.528 --> 18:20.399
I would give it to you
but you're never gonna
settle your tab,

18:20.433 --> 18:27.406
so this could pay for both of us
to get to the coast.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.976
Catch a boat to the big island.

18:31.210 --> 18:34.847
Lee, I love that.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.350
I do.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.385
But shit got real for me

18:42.221 --> 18:45.358
There's no running away
from it now.

18:47.627 --> 18:51.464
Then what're we doing here?

18:51.497 --> 18:53.532
It's just for a while.

18:53.566 --> 18:57.236
I needed to get some place safer
than that in the wilderness.

18:59.438 --> 19:03.142
Then I can figure out
these three pages.

19:03.175 --> 19:04.577
They could be anywhere.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.412
Or they could be long gone.

19:06.445 --> 19:10.149
No, they're out there.

19:10.182 --> 19:12.418
I can feel it.

19:15.855 --> 19:19.792
Well, from what I've heard
that coyote shows up

19:19.825 --> 19:22.161
once every few weeks.

19:22.194 --> 19:23.129
We hunker down here,

19:23.162 --> 19:25.665
maybe we get lucky and
it's only a day or two.

19:25.698 --> 19:29.335
No, I'm not sure I can wait
that long.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.838
Not safe.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.273
Vi? What is it?

19:34.306 --> 19:35.041
What's wrong?

19:37.610 --> 19:40.746
I got‐ I need to sit down.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.281
I'll get you some water.

19:48.821 --> 19:49.822
Vi?

19:52.525 --> 19:53.826
Vi?

19:53.859 --> 19:56.295
Vi? Vi?

19:57.329 --> 19:59.031
[gasping]

19:59.065 --> 20:00.399
What the hell just happened
to you?!

20:00.433 --> 20:03.102
Your eyes they were all white!

20:03.135 --> 20:03.969
We gotta leave.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.472
Woah, woah, woah.
Slow down, Violet.

20:06.505 --> 20:07.473
Talk to me.

20:07.506 --> 20:08.474
No.

20:08.507 --> 20:09.608
Let's move.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.143
Right now.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.920
We should go back to that
bus station and wait there.

20:20.953 --> 20:21.921
It's safer.

20:21.954 --> 20:22.788
No.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.957
Something tells me
that's a bad idea.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.792
The answers I need
aren't back there.

20:26.826 --> 20:27.593
Answers?

20:27.626 --> 20:28.794
You mean the three pages?

20:28.828 --> 20:29.595
Yeah.

20:29.628 --> 20:30.663
What're they for, exactly?

20:30.696 --> 20:32.998
Something to do with the portal
between our world

20:33.032 --> 20:35.468
and the place where Vanessa
and the Dark One are trapped.

20:35.501 --> 20:36.469
A means of opening it?

20:36.502 --> 20:37.536
Yeah.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.771
I think.

20:38.804 --> 20:41.107
Seriously Violet, we should
just go back to where we were.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.208
We can talk it all through.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.809
What else is there
to talk about?

20:43.843 --> 20:45.678
Lee, you know I've gotta
do this.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.152
Okay.

20:53.185 --> 20:56.989
Uh, well, these three pages.

20:57.022 --> 20:58.224
Have you ever seen
them before?

20:58.257 --> 21:00.993
Maybe someone
in your family?

21:01.026 --> 21:01.994
That's Van Helsing shit.

21:02.027 --> 21:04.630
I told you, I grew up
as Hansen's kid.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.632
I never knew about
any of this‐

21:07.233 --> 21:10.169
[clock ticking]

21:10.202 --> 21:12.104
What is it?

21:12.738 --> 21:14.774
The weirdest thing.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.181
I've seen this stuff before.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.750
What stuff?

21:24.784 --> 21:25.584
Don't lose focus, Violet.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.186
We have to get back
to the station.

21:27.219 --> 21:28.554
The pages.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.991
You don't understand.

21:32.024 --> 21:35.161
None of this stuff is supposed
to be out here.

21:35.194 --> 21:36.362
Listen to me.

21:36.395 --> 21:38.030
Focus on my voice.

21:38.063 --> 21:38.831
We have to go back.

21:38.864 --> 21:41.033
No! Get the hell off me!

21:41.066 --> 21:42.635
I'm not going back.

21:43.869 --> 21:46.238
[gasping]

21:46.906 --> 21:47.873
Violet.

21:47.907 --> 21:48.841
Violet!

21:48.874 --> 21:49.942
Focus on my voice.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.377
Wake up.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.045
[gasps]

21:55.915 --> 21:58.250
No. No, no, no.

21:58.284 --> 22:00.252
It can't be.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.261
I'm telling you,
I had a dream.

22:09.295 --> 22:11.297
More like a nightmare.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.132
You tried to kill me.

22:13.165 --> 22:13.933
What?

22:13.966 --> 22:15.201
That‐ that doesn't make
any sense.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.369
Why would I do that?

22:17.403 --> 22:20.072
See? You imagined it.

22:20.105 --> 22:21.006
Let me get you some water.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.375
No, but I swear I saw
this dream, okay?

22:23.409 --> 22:25.244
Look, you're upset.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.279
We should just stay here
and talk this through.

22:27.313 --> 22:29.882
Maybe it has something to do
with the pages.

22:29.915 --> 22:32.184
No. I have to go find them.

22:32.218 --> 22:33.352
That's the point.

22:33.385 --> 22:36.655
But you don't know where
they are or what they're for.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.924
Or‐ or do you?

22:38.958 --> 22:40.960
You think I'm lying to you?

22:40.993 --> 22:42.895
I'm trying to help, Violet.

22:42.928 --> 22:44.630
Just try to remember
for a second.

22:44.663 --> 22:46.398
Maybe Vanessa told you
where they were?

22:46.432 --> 22:47.967
Don't you think if I knew
how to find them

22:48.000 --> 22:48.734
I'd just go and do that?

22:48.767 --> 22:50.302
Then we should stay here.

22:50.336 --> 22:51.437
And what?

22:51.470 --> 22:54.106
Wait for the coyote?

22:54.139 --> 22:56.141
The coyote.

22:56.175 --> 22:59.111
You told me this was the place
to get to Hawaii.

22:59.144 --> 23:01.814
Yeah‐ well, of...
of course it is.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.284
I need to keep moving.

23:05.317 --> 23:06.652
Get this amulet away
from danger

23:06.685 --> 23:08.854
while I figure out this
three pages thing.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.923
Why don't we just leave
the amulet here?

23:10.956 --> 23:12.758
Hide it somewhere
if it's so much trouble.

23:12.791 --> 23:15.694
Lee, seriously, if you're gonna
make stupid suggestions.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.763
Violet, don't leave.

23:23.802 --> 23:26.105
We should go back to that
bus station and wait there.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.007
Would you just give up
on that?

23:28.040 --> 23:30.175
Something tells me...

23:30.209 --> 23:31.844
Tells you what?

23:31.877 --> 23:33.779
Nothing.

23:33.812 --> 23:36.682
You must know more about those
three pages than you realize.

23:36.715 --> 23:38.150
Like what?

23:38.183 --> 23:40.219
Vanessa must have known
something about them.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.820
Or her sister, Scarlett?

23:41.854 --> 23:43.923
Maybe the pages got passed
to her.

23:46.425 --> 23:56.435
[clock ticking sound]

24:05.344 --> 24:08.013
That painting.

24:08.047 --> 24:10.516
Something is very wrong
with you, Violet.

24:10.549 --> 24:13.052
We should go back.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.422
Since when do you use
my full name?

24:16.455 --> 24:18.490
You only ever call me Vi.

24:20.426 --> 24:21.860
I made a mistake.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.262
Not just one.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.364
How did you know about Scarlett?

24:25.397 --> 24:27.533
I never told you about her.

24:27.566 --> 24:28.734
Ever.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.503
[gasps]

24:31.937 --> 24:33.205
Violet! Violet!

24:33.238 --> 24:34.440
Focus on my voice.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.908
Wake up!

24:35.941 --> 24:38.043
[gasps]

24:38.077 --> 24:39.511
You stay the hell away from me!

24:39.545 --> 24:41.413
Don't touch me!

24:57.563 --> 24:59.431
(Michaela) This should
be working.

24:59.465 --> 25:01.433
Why is she questioning it?

25:01.467 --> 25:03.535
Why is she seeing things
we are not?

25:03.569 --> 25:04.603
(Bathory) Something's wrong.

25:04.636 --> 25:07.973
Maybe she has an immunity
to the enchantment.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.242
Or a stronger mind
than we realized.

25:10.275 --> 25:11.877
(Michaela) Keep trying.

25:11.910 --> 25:14.913
We must buy time for Ivory
to catch her.

25:14.947 --> 25:17.950
(Lee's voice) ...You're sister,
Scarlett...

25:30.195 --> 25:31.563
Violet.

25:31.597 --> 25:33.432
Vi, talk to me.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.679
Oh, shit!

25:47.713 --> 25:49.748
But why?

25:49.782 --> 25:52.017
And why here?

25:52.051 --> 25:53.052
What is it?

25:53.085 --> 25:55.120
Did you remember something?

26:01.126 --> 26:03.062
Using my full name?

26:03.095 --> 26:05.164
Forgetting what the coyote
was all about?

26:05.197 --> 26:07.099
Scarlett?

26:07.132 --> 26:08.567
What're you saying?

26:08.600 --> 26:09.701
You wanna know so bad?

26:09.735 --> 26:10.836
Then answer me this.

26:10.869 --> 26:13.705
I told you once how I was going
to pay off my bar tab.

26:13.739 --> 26:14.940
Remember?

26:14.973 --> 26:16.875
Of course. Come on.

26:16.909 --> 26:17.943
Then what is it?

26:17.976 --> 26:19.011
Huh?

26:19.044 --> 26:20.679
Tell me.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.482
Uh...

26:24.750 --> 26:26.952
This isn't actually happening.

26:26.985 --> 26:28.554
Vi.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.489
And you're not really Lee.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.192
You cannot escape your fate.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.760
It's only a matter of time.

26:34.793 --> 26:35.894
[gunshot]

26:38.163 --> 26:40.065
What happened?

26:40.099 --> 26:42.701
She saw through the illusion.

26:42.734 --> 26:43.836
That's impossible.

26:43.869 --> 26:45.804
And yet she did.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.774
But not before she
remembered something.

26:48.807 --> 26:50.542
(Michaela) We will know
soon enough.

26:50.576 --> 26:52.578
They are almost upon her.

26:58.817 --> 27:01.487
Come on, Vi.
Wake up.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.654
Come on, come on.

27:02.688 --> 27:04.056
[gasps]

27:04.089 --> 27:05.257
Whoa, whoa!

27:05.691 --> 27:07.259
How did I say I'd settle
my bar tab?

27:07.292 --> 27:08.727
Vi, what‐ what're you doing?

27:08.760 --> 27:10.662
Answer the damn question!

27:10.696 --> 27:11.997
By paying our way to Hawaii!

27:12.030 --> 27:12.998
You know, the coyote‐ you‐

27:13.031 --> 27:15.567
I was gonna teach you
how to surf, remember?

27:16.635 --> 27:18.103
Yeah.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.646
How long have I been out?

27:27.679 --> 27:28.947
I don't know.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.117
Long enough to scare
the shit out of me.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.753
I think I know
where those pages are.

27:34.786 --> 27:35.988
But we gotta move.

27:36.021 --> 27:37.089
Right now.

27:37.122 --> 27:38.757
Grab your bag.

27:39.191 --> 27:40.759
[snarling]

27:43.829 --> 27:44.663
Stand behind me.

27:44.696 --> 27:47.132
Don't let them get between us,
got it?

27:47.166 --> 27:49.768
You frightened little rabbit
that ran away?

27:49.801 --> 27:51.303
It's time to come back.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.872
Yeah. How about I kick
your ass instead?

27:53.906 --> 27:55.974
[laughing]

27:56.008 --> 28:01.046
We don't fear you,
Van Helsing.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.314
First mistake.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.982
Maybe your last.
