01:33.960 --> 01:37.510
Oh, good. Excuse me.

01:37.510 --> 01:39.520
Lift up my side.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.020
That's pain.

01:45.020 --> 01:46.360

All right, now,
Doris, come here.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.700
You are a terrific driver.
You dig it? Terrific.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.710
Next time, just keep
your hands on the wheel.

02:02.710 --> 02:05.210
That ain't too much
to ask, you know?

02:05.210 --> 02:06.710
Hey, all right.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.710
Excuse me, Fonzie.
I need your advice.

02:08.710 --> 02:09.710
Yeah?

02:09.710 --> 02:11.630
Do you think the TV
set there is okay?

02:11.920 --> 02:14.000
Al, I got other
problems on my mind.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.840
My bike is busted--
can you dig it?

02:16.090 --> 02:18.670
I mean, I got 50 chicks here
dying to drive me home.

02:18.670 --> 02:20.170
Well, what we're
going to do

02:20.170 --> 02:22.180
is we're going
to have all the
football games now

02:22.180 --> 02:24.010
and in color.
Whoopee, Al.

02:24.260 --> 02:25.850
Yeah, well, it's going
to be a big thing,

02:25.850 --> 02:27.850
I mean, since Ralph
started gambling

02:27.850 --> 02:29.150
with those
football cards.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.400
Yeah, I'll
tell you something.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.900
That bubblegum king
is getting out of hand, huh?

02:32.270 --> 02:34.190
What do you think
of the new Ralph?

02:34.440 --> 02:37.020
I think I like
the old one better.

02:37.020 --> 02:39.030
All right, all right,
all right.

02:39.030 --> 02:40.030
Now, girls... girls,
when I get back,

02:40.030 --> 02:41.030
I'm going to
have the answer

02:41.030 --> 02:43.030
to who can drive
me home, all right?

02:43.030 --> 02:44.450
So just...
just keep calm.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.330
Have your driver's license
ready.

02:46.330 --> 02:48.840
No learner's permits.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.340
This is private, girls.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.550
All right, all right,
step right up!

02:59.550 --> 03:01.050
The big game is about to start.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.550
Put your bets down.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.050
College or pro.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.390
All you need
is three teams to win.

03:06.690 --> 03:09.060
Taking candy from a baby,
right, doll face?

03:09.310 --> 03:10.890
Right, sugar lips.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.890
Sugar lips. Thank you.

03:13.890 --> 03:15.860
Okay, check off
your three teams.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.810
Malph, get your
hockey stuff together.

03:17.810 --> 03:19.820
Game starts in 30 minutes.

03:19.820 --> 03:21.820
Sheila, I don't believe
you've met the boys.

03:21.820 --> 03:23.120
Richie and Potsie,

03:23.370 --> 03:25.910
my very close friend Sheila.
Charmed.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.370
Nice to meet you.

03:27.870 --> 03:29.210
Hey, Ralph, come on.
You got to help us out,

03:29.460 --> 03:30.540
We got a game.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.550
Okay, okay.
Will you excuse me, baby?

03:32.550 --> 03:34.050
Ooh! Anything

03:34.050 --> 03:35.420
you say, sugar lips.

03:35.670 --> 03:37.050
Boys.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.300
Sugar lips, huh?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.300
How about that Sheila?

03:41.300 --> 03:44.720
There's one manicurist
who can curl your cuticles!

03:45.010 --> 03:46.980
We're talking about
hockey, not cuticles.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.350
Gentlemen, I have a business
to run here.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.680
Yeah, but... but
you're our goalie.

03:51.980 --> 03:53.070
Without you,
what chance do we have

03:53.070 --> 03:54.850
against
the Shotz Hot Shots?

03:55.070 --> 03:56.650
Very little.

03:56.650 --> 03:58.150
What's with you, Malph?

03:58.150 --> 03:59.660
Ever since you took
over this football pool,

03:59.660 --> 04:00.940
we haven't been able
to talk to you.

04:01.190 --> 04:02.280
You can still
talk to me.

04:02.780 --> 04:03.780
The only difference
is now it costs money.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.110
All right,

04:05.360 --> 04:06.950
any three teams to win,

04:06.950 --> 04:08.280
college or pro,
dollar minimum,

04:08.500 --> 04:10.080
dollar gets you ten.
Forget it.

04:10.580 --> 04:11.580
Like my rings, guys?

04:11.580 --> 04:13.090
Wait a minute.
You're giving ten to one?

04:13.090 --> 04:14.090
Uh-huh.

04:14.090 --> 04:15.590
All right, I'll
take one of those.

04:15.590 --> 04:16.420
Here you go.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.260
Rich, I'll
need a dollar.

04:18.260 --> 04:19.760
I'm good for it.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.760
Oh, yeah.
You're my friend.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.680
Okay, I'll give
you till tonight.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.680
Malph, are you
playing hockey or not?

04:27.680 --> 04:30.190
One second, Pots.

04:30.190 --> 04:31.640
Wake Forest?

04:32.020 --> 04:34.110
You're picking Wake Forest
to beat Notre Dame?

04:34.110 --> 04:36.640
(stifling laughter)

04:36.890 --> 04:37.980
I like the points.

04:37.980 --> 04:40.400
Some guys will do anything
to throw away their money.

04:40.730 --> 04:42.320
See you, Pots.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.820
Keep going for those
long shots, Richie.

04:44.820 --> 04:48.320
Okay, okay, one hour
till game time!

04:48.320 --> 04:49.820
Put down your bets.

04:49.820 --> 04:51.320
Bruiser!

04:51.320 --> 04:53.240
Take a card.

04:53.630 --> 04:56.210
He's even taking
a bet from Bruiser.

04:56.210 --> 04:57.130
He's sick.

04:57.410 --> 04:59.500
Oh, yeah,
but he's rich.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.000
Hey, sugar lips!

05:01.000 --> 05:01.880
Hey, baby.

05:02.220 --> 05:03.300
Girls!

05:03.300 --> 05:05.310
Hey. Fonz,
Fonz, Fonz.

05:06.310 --> 05:08.310
Wait a minute,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

05:08.310 --> 05:09.730
I said girls,
not candy canes.

05:11.140 --> 05:12.980
Yeah, but we got to talk
to you about something.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.180
Yeah? What about?

05:14.480 --> 05:15.520
We haven't got a goalie, Fonz.

05:15.900 --> 05:16.480
What happened to Ralph?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.940
Well, he... he's
gotten carried away

05:18.940 --> 05:20.940
with these football
betting cards.

05:20.940 --> 05:21.940
Yeah, I noticed.
I noticed.

05:21.940 --> 05:23.940
He's a big boy.
It's his funeral.

05:23.940 --> 05:26.330
Hey, Fonz, you want
to be our goalie?

05:26.580 --> 05:28.910
You want to be a puck?

05:30.700 --> 05:33.200
No, thanks.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.000
Come on, Pots.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.280
Yeah.
Thanks anyway, Fonz.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.290
Yeah, Fonz.

05:38.290 --> 05:39.790
All right, now,
girls, let's get
down to business.

05:39.790 --> 05:41.290
Let's get down
to business.

05:41.290 --> 05:43.090
Whoever catches
this comb,

05:43.290 --> 05:44.260
gets to drive me home, huh?

05:45.760 --> 05:48.630
Ooh, you lucky girls.
Here you go.

05:48.850 --> 05:50.270
All right,
all right!

05:50.550 --> 05:51.630
Congratulations,
Cicely.

05:51.630 --> 05:53.020
Now go out there
and warm up the car.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.440
Oh, you know,
I'll tell you something.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.940
My heart is
like Mount Rushmore.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.440
I understand it's cold.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.280
I understand it's cold, all
right? You can all ride along.

06:01.480 --> 06:02.560
(gasping)
That's right.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.650

that don't fit,
run along the sides.

Oh, Mom, why did you have
to get succotash again?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.880
That's your
father's favorite,

06:23.880 --> 06:25.890
and besides,
it's very healthy for you.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.760
Well, it may be healthy,
but it makes me sick.

06:29.010 --> 06:30.590
Will you just
put away the groceries?

06:30.590 --> 06:32.590
Your father will be home
from his Leopard meeting,

06:32.590 --> 06:33.930
and he'll be hungry
as a bear.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.680
Oh, good one, Mom.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.480
What? What did I say?

06:37.480 --> 06:38.820
You know--
leopard, bear.
What?

06:39.100 --> 06:41.680
Forget it.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.190
Look, Rich, if you could
just give me the dollar.

06:44.190 --> 06:46.610
Oh, Ralph, don't
you look spiffy?

06:46.940 --> 06:48.910
Thank you. Thank you.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.740
So, how are things
on the riverboat?

06:51.110 --> 06:52.660
Sit on it.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.530
How was the hockey game?

06:55.920 --> 06:57.200
We lost, 12 to nothing.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.450
Oh. Is that bad?

06:59.790 --> 07:04.260
Not when you consider we had
a German Shepherd for a goalie.

07:04.540 --> 07:07.130
Hey, Rich, wait a minute.

07:07.130 --> 07:08.590
Where are you going?

07:08.590 --> 07:09.630
I'm going upstairs
to change my clothes.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.100
Why? Do you want
to make a bet

07:11.100 --> 07:13.130
on what color
socks I put on?

07:13.130 --> 07:14.100
Aw, come on Rich.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.130
Football's my specialty.

07:15.130 --> 07:16.640
Pick a pro team.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.140
No. No, I lost a dollar
today, and that's it.

07:18.140 --> 07:18.940
I'm not betting anymore.

07:19.110 --> 07:20.690
Oh, Rich,
what's a buck

07:20.690 --> 07:22.190
to an ambitious
kid like you?

07:22.190 --> 07:23.980
Green Bay Packers
are a cinch to win.

07:24.140 --> 07:25.230
Don't hand me that.

07:25.230 --> 07:27.030
Everybody knows
Paul Hornung's got a bad leg.

07:27.230 --> 07:28.820
He'll play
in a wheelchair.

07:28.820 --> 07:30.320
What's the difference?

07:30.320 --> 07:32.290
Everybody in Milwaukee
bets Green Bay.

07:32.620 --> 07:33.570
That could be
a pretty good game.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.400
A great game.
Here. Green Bay's
the third one down.

07:35.790 --> 07:37.370
I see it.
I see Green Bay.

07:37.370 --> 07:40.380
What does your dad
think of this?

07:40.380 --> 07:41.380
Are you kidding?

07:41.380 --> 07:42.880
He doesn't know.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.160
He'd crack up.
He'd go ding-dong.

07:45.410 --> 07:47.500
I think you're getting a little
carried away here, Ralph.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.800
I mean, at ten to one,
what happens if you lose?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.050
The odds never go
against the house.

07:52.050 --> 07:54.010
Okay, house,
here's your card.

07:54.010 --> 07:55.060
Thanks.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.060
I liked it better when
you were a comic, Ralph.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.070
Why are you following
me up to my room?

08:03.070 --> 08:05.070
Hey, a buck's a buck.

08:05.070 --> 08:07.940
Hey, Rich, you think
Rockefeller got rich
trusting people?

08:08.190 --> 08:11.770
It's always a pleasure
to drive you home, Howie.

08:11.770 --> 08:13.280
You're such a sweet guy.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.280
Mickey, you don't have
to butter me up.

08:15.280 --> 08:16.780
If the lodge thinks
that Ralph should

08:16.780 --> 08:18.780
be Junior Leopard
of the Year, then he will.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.780
Hello, Howard.

08:20.780 --> 08:21.780
Oh, hi, sweetheart.

08:21.780 --> 08:23.700
Did you get
the succotash?
Oh.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.090
Hello, Mickey,

08:25.090 --> 08:27.040
Ralph is
right upstairs.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.590
Oh, good.
We can drive home together.

08:28.590 --> 08:29.590
We'll have some laughs.

08:29.590 --> 08:31.010
The kid's got
a great personality.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.380
Right, Howie?

08:32.760 --> 08:35.850
I wish you'd please
stop calling me Howie.

08:35.850 --> 08:37.850
Oh, Howie, the
kid's a natural.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.640
He's cute and witty.

08:39.850 --> 08:40.940
You know, when
they made Ralph,

08:40.940 --> 08:41.940
they broke the mold.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.860
I can see why.

08:45.190 --> 08:47.780
Do you have
a teenage daughter, Mickey?

08:47.780 --> 08:49.780
No.
Would you like one?

08:50.200 --> 08:53.650
(laughing)
Good one, Howie.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.480
RALPH:
So, Rich, look.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.490
I took the odds
from all the papers,

08:57.490 --> 08:59.490
and then I figured out
the averages.

08:59.490 --> 09:02.490
Oh, hi, Dad.
I was just explaining averages,

09:02.490 --> 09:03.960
helping Richie with some math.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.500
Oh, what
a kid, huh?

09:06.500 --> 09:08.380
Helps his friends, huh?

09:08.660 --> 09:10.170
Hey, my boy, Ralphie.
Right, Pop. Right.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.920
Well, we better

09:12.130 --> 09:13.220
hit the road, Ralphie.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.220
Okay, Dad.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.720
Uh! Let's give them one.

09:16.220 --> 09:17.220
Okay, Dad.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.680
Hey, Dad,

09:20.060 --> 09:21.140
you know, I just came
back from Africa,

09:21.140 --> 09:23.150
and I played cards
with the natives.

09:23.150 --> 09:24.650
Zulus?

09:24.650 --> 09:25.650
No. I won.

09:25.650 --> 09:26.980
Ha-cha-cha!
Ha-cha-cha!

09:33.520 --> 09:35.110
Come and get it.

09:35.110 --> 09:40.110
Well, thank goodness we still
have Abbott and Costello.

09:40.530 --> 09:43.580
Oh, good!
I'm hungry as a bear.

09:43.580 --> 09:45.250
(dog barking)

09:45.750 --> 09:49.210
Oh, Mom, uh, could you save
the bone for our goalie?

09:49.590 --> 09:51.620
Yes, dear.

09:54.540 --> 09:56.960
You have a dog for a goalie?

09:57.350 --> 09:59.720
Yeah. He played today.

10:01.970 --> 10:06.390
♪ Wa, wa, wa-wa, wa-wa, wa ♪

10:06.390 --> 10:09.280
♪ Wa-wa, wa-wa, wa. ♪

10:09.560 --> 10:12.140
RICHIE:
Can't you fix the color, Al?

10:12.140 --> 10:14.150
AL:
What do you want from me?
I can't.

10:14.150 --> 10:17.120
Bruiser broke the antenna off.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.990
Such a boring game.

10:20.990 --> 10:22.740
He dropped it
again. Look.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.050
Aw, come on.

10:30.050 --> 10:33.000
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

10:35.550 --> 10:36.970
Green Bay's down by 11 points.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.310
They'll catch up.
You know the Packers.

10:39.310 --> 10:41.260
(softly):
They haven't got a prayer.

10:41.260 --> 10:42.810
There's two
minutes to go.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.230
Let's have a soda,
you beautiful thing.

10:45.560 --> 10:46.560
Come on.
Put in Hornung!

10:46.900 --> 10:48.480
Don't worry, Pots.
They'll put him in.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.980
(softly):
They'll never put him in.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.980
The man should be
in a wheelchair.

10:51.980 --> 10:54.770
Okay, service! May we
have service, Alfred?

10:55.020 --> 10:58.610
Ralph, I'm trying
to watch a football game.

10:58.610 --> 11:01.110
Al, I'm buying sodas
for the house.

11:01.610 --> 11:03.410
Oh. Well, I can
read about it
in the newspaper.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.000
Could you turn up
the sound?

11:05.250 --> 11:06.830
There isn't any sound.

11:06.830 --> 11:09.250
After the Wake Forest game,
Bruiser bit off the knob.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.920
(laughing)

11:14.870 --> 11:16.710
Look at that. Come on!

11:17.090 --> 11:18.960
Come on!

11:19.180 --> 11:22.260
MAN: We're gonna
lose our shirts.

11:22.260 --> 11:24.270
Hi, Fonz.

11:24.270 --> 11:25.770
I'm buying
everybody sodas,

11:25.770 --> 11:27.270
but I want you to
have a cheeseburger.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.550
How does that sound?

11:28.800 --> 11:30.390
Let me tell
you something, Malph.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.890
I got my own problems,
all right?

11:31.890 --> 11:33.810
I got to find a piston,
and they ain't cheap.

11:34.190 --> 11:36.700
You need money,
and I can use an associate.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.610
Hey! Hey!
All right! Yeah!

11:39.120 --> 11:39.620
Interception!

11:39.620 --> 11:42.070
Green Bay just
intercepted a pass!

11:42.450 --> 11:43.490
POTSIE:
They're going all the way
for the touchdown!

11:43.870 --> 11:45.740
(all cheering)

11:45.960 --> 11:48.540
I told you guys
they'd catch up.

11:48.540 --> 11:49.540
Thank you, my dear.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.710
(all cheering)

11:54.080 --> 11:57.170
I could use a tough cookie
like you to help me collect.

11:59.670 --> 12:04.170
First of all,
the Fonz is not a cookie.

12:04.170 --> 12:07.180
See, a cookie is something
you put in your mouth.

12:07.180 --> 12:09.680
Like this.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.680
Bad choice of words.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.680
Let... let me rephrase.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.190
Yeah, do that. Rephrase.

12:18.690 --> 12:20.070
Fonzie,

12:20.360 --> 12:23.240
I am prepared to offer you
ten percent of my business.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.490
Malph, do you have any idea

12:25.490 --> 12:26.950
what a dirty business
you're getting into?

12:28.780 --> 12:30.370
All right,
all right, 50-50.

12:30.870 --> 12:31.870
Malph...

12:31.870 --> 12:32.870
Don't say it.

12:33.370 --> 12:34.870
You're moved,
I can see it.

12:34.870 --> 12:36.370
Yeah, I'm moved.

12:36.370 --> 12:39.880
Outside-- there's
too much hot air in here.

12:40.290 --> 12:42.880
(all shouting, cheering)

12:42.880 --> 12:44.880
Hey, listen, Ralph,
you better get over here,

12:45.260 --> 12:46.350
because everybody
bet on Green Bay

12:46.350 --> 12:48.350
and you could lose
a lot of money--

12:48.350 --> 12:49.350
you could lose
your shirt.

12:49.350 --> 12:50.850
Hey wait,
fumble.

12:50.850 --> 12:51.850
Green Bay
recovered it!

12:51.850 --> 12:53.310
Look, look, look!

12:53.720 --> 12:55.640
They're putting in Hornung!

12:55.860 --> 12:58.360
They won't put in Hornung--
the man can't even walk.

13:00.860 --> 13:02.450
What's he doing?

13:02.450 --> 13:04.870
Get out of there--
you got a bad leg!

13:05.230 --> 13:06.620
It looks like
he's recovered to me.

13:06.790 --> 13:08.650
What do <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">you know!
The man's not fit to play{\r}.</font></font></i>

13:08.870 --> 13:10.960
Look at him run!
There he goes!

13:10.960 --> 13:12.960
Okay, okay, look, we all
know who's gonna win.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.960
(indistinct shouting)
I'm gonna turn this off.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.380
35! He's at the 35!
30!

13:17.710 --> 13:19.300
ALL:
The 25... 20...

13:19.800 --> 13:21.300
15... ten...

13:21.300 --> 13:23.750
the five... touchdown!

13:24.170 --> 13:25.590
(shouting, whooping)

13:27.000 --> 13:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:34.230 --> 13:36.230
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Where's Ralph?

13:44.690 --> 13:46.660
Come on, Ralph, you
owe us a lot of money.

13:47.110 --> 13:48.110
You better pay up.

13:48.440 --> 13:52.030
Don't worry, you're
gonna get every penny of it,

13:52.030 --> 13:54.030
in due time.

13:54.030 --> 13:55.420
It's time.

13:56.790 --> 13:58.290
Hiya, Bruiser.

13:58.290 --> 13:59.790
Don't go run off.

13:59.790 --> 14:01.790
I got a winner--
I got Green Bay.

14:01.790 --> 14:04.790
You sure do, Bruiser--
you did real good.

14:06.260 --> 14:07.760
I want my 80 bucks!

14:07.760 --> 14:10.770
Look, Bruiser, I'm a
little short right now.

14:10.770 --> 14:12.270
How about a camel's hair?

14:12.270 --> 14:14.270
I want my 80 bucks!

14:14.270 --> 14:15.270
Okay, Bruiser, look,

14:15.270 --> 14:17.770
now, you're gonna
have to trust me.

14:17.770 --> 14:20.030
I sense a lack
of trust here.

14:20.310 --> 14:22.860
Wait! Bruiser,
wait a second, wait a second.

14:22.860 --> 14:25.400
Don't try anything--
I got to tell you something!
What?

14:25.400 --> 14:26.900
I can't stand pain!

14:27.400 --> 14:28.900
Please don't hurt me.
Please.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.400
Pain makes me cry.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.410
Look, I'll give you
the money, I promise.

14:33.410 --> 14:34.410
When?

14:34.410 --> 14:36.410
Very soon-- just tell me,
how soon do you want it?

14:36.410 --> 14:37.240
I want it now.

14:37.540 --> 14:38.630
That soon?

14:38.630 --> 14:39.580
How about tomorrow?

14:40.000 --> 14:40.580
Too late!

14:41.050 --> 14:42.080
Wait! Wait!
There's Fonzie!

14:42.580 --> 14:43.580
There's Fonzie!
It's Fonz!

14:44.080 --> 14:45.420
Like I said, Bruiser,

14:45.720 --> 14:47.800
you'll get your money
when you get it.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.810
Right, Fonz?

14:49.810 --> 14:50.810
Pal?

14:50.810 --> 14:53.310
I hear Malph
owes you some money.

14:53.310 --> 14:54.310
Yeah, 80 bucks.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.810
Richie said
you had a big problem.

14:56.810 --> 14:59.820
Worse than a problem,
Fonz, he was gonna
rearrange my face.

14:59.820 --> 15:03.320
Nothing less than I would do
had you welched on me.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.820
(whimpering)

15:04.820 --> 15:06.820
He's kidding,
he's kidding!
Good one, Fonz.

15:06.820 --> 15:08.320
He's a kidder.
Put him straight, Fonz.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.830
Hey, listen, I just came
in here to check my hair.

15:10.830 --> 15:12.830
Perfect, as usual.
Wait a minute!

15:12.830 --> 15:15.330
Hold it!
Hold it!
Fonzie!

15:15.330 --> 15:16.830
Bruiser.

15:16.830 --> 15:18.330
Yeah?

15:18.330 --> 15:19.840
I don't think
there's any sport

15:19.840 --> 15:22.840
in beating up a guy who's
groveling at your feet?

15:22.840 --> 15:24.760
I bet you could
give him 24 hours.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.090
I don't think
I want to wait.

15:26.460 --> 15:27.430
I think you do.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.460
I do?
Yeah.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.970
Yeah, I think I can wait.

15:32.970 --> 15:34.470
Okay, Malph.

15:34.470 --> 15:37.470
But I think I ought to get
some kind of insurance.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.390
What do you got
that's worth 80 bucks?

15:39.720 --> 15:41.810
(whimpers, pants)

15:41.810 --> 15:43.310
Nothing.
I'm all cleaned out.

15:43.310 --> 15:46.150
All I got left are
the fillings in my teeth.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.900
FONZIE:
Uh, Bruiser...

15:51.120 --> 15:52.200
I think he was kidding.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.120
He fancies himself
like a comedian, you know?

15:54.450 --> 15:56.040
Bruiser ain't one of
your fun-loving audiences.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.540
I can tell that right away.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.380
Hey, uh, you interested
in that chick out
there, uh, Sheila?

16:01.660 --> 16:03.750
The brainy chick?

16:03.750 --> 16:06.080
Yeah. Yeah, that's the one.

16:06.330 --> 16:07.920
You can have her, Bruiser.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.920
She's outside,
and she'll do your nails.

16:10.920 --> 16:11.920
The manicurist?

16:11.920 --> 16:13.920
Yeah, the
brainy one.

16:13.920 --> 16:14.920
Okay!

16:14.920 --> 16:17.930
Well, you got 24 hours.

16:17.930 --> 16:20.430
Wonder what
we'll talk about.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.440
Fonz, you saved my life.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.440
Yeah.

16:33.440 --> 16:36.950
Oh, man, was that
a close one!

16:36.950 --> 16:38.830
Fonzie...

16:39.160 --> 16:41.750
what am I gonna do?
Well, you're either
gonna pay him back,

16:41.750 --> 16:44.590
or you're gonna learn to live
very comfortably in pain.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.960
Come on, Fonz.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.960
You were gonna lend it to me
all the time, weren't you, pal?

16:48.960 --> 16:51.960
Never entered
my mind, pal.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.460
(whimpers)

16:53.960 --> 16:55.430
Hey, like Fred Astaire said:

16:55.960 --> 16:58.300
"You want to dance,
you got to pay the fiddler."

16:58.600 --> 17:00.190
Oh, but, Fonz, you saw Bruiser--

17:00.190 --> 17:02.050
he ain't Fred Astaire.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.390
You'll find the money somewhere.

17:05.770 --> 17:06.780
But what if I don't?

17:07.060 --> 17:09.140
Hey...

17:09.140 --> 17:12.109
how much damage can the,
uh, Bruiser do to you?

17:12.480 --> 17:13.530
A lot, Fonz, a lot.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.869
Yeah, well, you're
young, you'll recover.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.700
(whimpers)

17:18.200 --> 17:19.710
(girls shrieking, squealing)

17:20.210 --> 17:22.710
And you think
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">you've got a problem{\r}.</font></font></i>

17:27.210 --> 17:28.660
Come on, Malph,

17:29.080 --> 17:31.670
get a grip on yourself,
will ya?

17:31.670 --> 17:33.670
There you go, Ralphie boy.

17:33.670 --> 17:36.170
Now, look, you're
gonna have to grow up.

17:36.170 --> 17:39.170
Just talk to your father, okay?

17:40.680 --> 17:42.680
Better, you get Richie to do it.

17:42.680 --> 17:44.060
(chuckles)

17:44.350 --> 17:46.930
I still got it.

17:52.190 --> 17:55.270
Richie, I really appreciate
you helping me,

17:55.270 --> 17:58.280
but I don't understand
why your dad is coming.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.280
D-Don't play with the
equipment, come on.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.780
He's coming because
I-I explained it to him, and...

18:04.280 --> 18:05.280
Look, don't you understand?

18:05.700 --> 18:08.170
Old people have a way
of talking to each other.

18:10.170 --> 18:12.760
J-Just trust me,
all right?
All right.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.260
Okay, guys,
I'm here.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.760
Oh, thanks for
coming, Howie.

18:18.210 --> 18:20.220
Like father, like son.

18:20.220 --> 18:23.220
You know, this neighborhood
is getting real weird.

18:23.220 --> 18:26.110
There's a girl downstairs
giving some rough-looking
guy a manicure.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.940
(whimpers)

18:28.940 --> 18:30.940
Oh, I... I guess
that's Bruiser.

18:30.940 --> 18:32.900
I'll go down
and get him.
Richie...

18:33.230 --> 18:35.150
Just a joke.
Ha-cha-cha!

18:39.030 --> 18:40.540
Will you guys quit
clowning around!

18:41.040 --> 18:43.460
I got to get back to
work in a half hour.

18:43.740 --> 18:45.320
Where's your dad?
He's in the lab.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.330
Come on, Rich, let's wait
in the reception room.

18:47.330 --> 18:49.330
Don't try and run off
on me, Ralph.

18:49.330 --> 18:51.330
Where would I go?
Bruiser's downstairs.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.330
I may sleep here.

18:55.330 --> 18:58.750
Mickey, come on out--
I haven't got all day.

19:05.090 --> 19:06.600
Hi, Howie.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.770
Gotcha!
(laughing)

19:09.770 --> 19:11.270
You scared me, Mickey!

19:11.770 --> 19:12.770
Well, how could that be?

19:12.770 --> 19:14.770
You haven't seen
the bill yet.

19:14.770 --> 19:16.270
(laughing)

19:16.270 --> 19:18.270
I didn't come here
for an examination--

19:18.770 --> 19:20.280
I got to get back to work.

19:20.780 --> 19:21.660
Listen, I, uh,

19:21.940 --> 19:24.360
I came here to talk
to you about Ralph.

19:24.610 --> 19:26.030
He won!

19:26.280 --> 19:28.370
My little Ralphie--
he's Leopard of the Year!

19:28.370 --> 19:29.870
Oh-ho, sit back, sit back!

19:29.870 --> 19:31.870
Oh, I knew you'd
come through, Howie.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.870
I'm gonna give you
a free checkup.

19:33.870 --> 19:36.760
Cover your eye and read
the chart. All right.
No... Mickey,

19:37.090 --> 19:38.680
it is nothing like that.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.510
Now, will you please
let me finish?

19:42.050 --> 19:44.630
Now, listen to me.

19:44.630 --> 19:47.470
Your son Ralph
is in trouble.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.770
Some girl got
my Ralph in trouble?

19:55.690 --> 19:57.980
No, Mickey, it's not that.

19:58.150 --> 19:59.730
You see, your son Ralph

19:59.730 --> 20:02.990
has been running
a gambling operation,

20:03.200 --> 20:05.120
and he's got some
real problems.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.240
My Ralph?
Mm-hmm.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.120
Gambling?

20:09.120 --> 20:10.630
It's true.

20:10.630 --> 20:13.130
But I think maybe he'd better
tell you the rest himself.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.130
He's waiting outside.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.330
Okay, come on, Ralph,
he's all yours.

20:22.670 --> 20:24.170
Ralph.

20:24.170 --> 20:26.680
Hi, Dad.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.640
Howard here has been
trying to tell me

20:29.180 --> 20:31.680
that you're
in some kind of a mess.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.680
Now, I want you to
tell me, Ralphie,

20:33.680 --> 20:36.180
who it is that
got you in trouble.

20:36.180 --> 20:37.650
Was it Potsie?

20:37.650 --> 20:38.490
Fonzie! Fonzie.

20:38.820 --> 20:39.910
Dad, it wasn't anyone.

20:40.410 --> 20:41.410
It was me.

20:41.410 --> 20:43.190
I got myself in trouble.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.940
Aw, Ralphie, you're too good.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.450
You're too good.

20:47.450 --> 20:49.450
You're always
protecting your friends.

20:49.450 --> 20:51.420
Now, I want you
to tell your pop,

20:51.780 --> 20:53.370
who are you
covering up for?

20:53.370 --> 20:55.750
Dad, I'm not covering
for anybody.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.370
I don't get it.
What's the punch line?

21:00.180 --> 21:01.680
What's the matter
with us, Dad?

21:01.680 --> 21:03.680
We can't even talk
to each other.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.430
All we do is tell jokes!

21:05.430 --> 21:07.380
Don't yell at me--
I'm your father.

21:07.380 --> 21:08.970
Well, then why don't
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">you yell at me{\r}?</font></font></i>

21:08.970 --> 21:10.970
It was my fault, Dad,
only my fault!

21:10.970 --> 21:14.220
I'm a teenage bookie!

21:18.480 --> 21:20.530
Sit down, Ralphie.

21:28.070 --> 21:29.990
What you said just now,
that's true.

21:32.490 --> 21:34.410
I never yell at you.

21:34.410 --> 21:37.000
Dad...
That's because
you're an only child.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I don't know.

21:44.550 --> 21:47.140
Maybe I've been
too worried about...

21:47.140 --> 21:49.640
being a pal instead of a father.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.260
We always had such fun together.

21:58.770 --> 22:00.270
Dad?

22:08.530 --> 22:10.610
Dad...

22:10.610 --> 22:12.610
I'm-I'm sorry
I let you down.

22:12.610 --> 22:17.120
I know you always thought
I was Mr. Perfect.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.960
Well, not really <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">perfect{\r}.</font></font></i>

22:19.960 --> 22:21.540
Dad!

22:21.540 --> 22:23.040
Almost perfect.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.630
Almost perfect.

22:24.630 --> 22:25.930
(laughs)

22:25.930 --> 22:28.260
(laughs)

22:28.260 --> 22:29.850
Hey, Ralphie...

22:29.850 --> 22:32.350
what are we gonna do about
this gambling business?

22:33.850 --> 22:35.350
Oh, well, Dad...

22:35.350 --> 22:38.690
you know, I know
what I did was wrong,

22:38.690 --> 22:41.230
and I promise, I'll never
do it again, I promise.

22:41.230 --> 22:43.060
But I owe a lot of money.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.950
How much?

22:47.950 --> 22:50.320
Dad, sit down.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.660
Dad...

22:56.660 --> 22:58.660
I owe $80.

23:00.910 --> 23:03.330
Eighty dollars?!

23:05.000 --> 23:06.500
Come here.

23:10.470 --> 23:12.970
Ralphie, I'm gonna
give it to you.

23:12.970 --> 23:15.980
But you're gonna work it
off of your allowance

23:15.980 --> 23:20.480
two nights a week
right here in this office!

23:20.480 --> 23:24.990
It'll help you out later
when you become an optometrist.

23:24.990 --> 23:26.740
Dad, I don't want

23:26.740 --> 23:29.570
to be an optometrist,
I want to be a comedian.

23:29.570 --> 23:31.610
You're joking.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.500
Dad, Dad,
I'm-I'm serious.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.580
Comedian?

23:39.080 --> 23:40.090
(chuckles)

23:40.090 --> 23:43.090
Ralphie, all
kidding aside, huh,

23:43.090 --> 23:45.040
you're not that funny.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.380
I'm not?

23:49.710 --> 23:50.760
Gotcha.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.350
(laughing)

23:52.350 --> 23:54.850
Hey, Dad, we
still got it.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.850
We still got it.

23:56.850 --> 23:58.850
I'm not that funny?

24:08.780 --> 24:10.870
Howie...

24:10.870 --> 24:13.700
let's us do a
father-and-son thing.

24:13.700 --> 24:16.240
I can't-- my father
lives in Florida.

24:17.710 --> 24:20.080
Oh, no, no, no,
I mean us.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.490
Us.

24:21.490 --> 24:23.330
Oh! Gotcha!

24:24.830 --> 24:26.160
How'd it go?

24:26.160 --> 24:28.250
Well, all right, I guess.

24:28.250 --> 24:31.750
But Ralphie told me he doesn't
want to be an optometrist.

24:31.750 --> 24:33.720
he wants to be a comedian.

24:35.670 --> 24:39.090
I'll tell you, Mickey,
it's tough being a parent.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.930
Come on, guys.

24:41.930 --> 24:45.020
Seems like he
took it pretty well.

24:45.020 --> 24:48.020
Well, I told him
a lot of things, Rich.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.020
It wasn't easy.

24:49.020 --> 24:51.490
It's tough
being a kid.
