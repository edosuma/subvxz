00:10.643 --> 00:13.146
You're traveling
through another dimension-

00:13.181 --> 00:16.282
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

00:16.317 --> 00:18.151
a journey into a wondrous land

00:18.186 --> 00:20.653
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.156
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

00:50.683 --> 00:53.820
Rachel,
open up in there.

00:53.855 --> 00:55.688
Got my arms full.

01:03.196 --> 01:05.698
Well, old man, what are
you hollering about?

01:05.733 --> 01:07.584
You going to
suffocate in there

01:07.619 --> 01:08.835
from lack of air.

01:08.870 --> 01:11.337
Why don't you leave
the door open?

01:11.372 --> 01:12.589
I got to keep that dog

01:12.624 --> 01:14.457
out of the house
somehow-

01:14.492 --> 01:16.709
coming in here
with his fleas

01:16.744 --> 01:17.961
and with
his ticks.

01:17.996 --> 01:21.714
Aw, old woman, don't start
that commotion up again.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.600
When i go in the house,

01:23.635 --> 01:24.968
rip goes, too.

01:25.003 --> 01:26.352
That dog saved my life.

01:28.104 --> 01:29.472
Well...

01:29.507 --> 01:30.974
let the ornery
thing come in.

01:31.009 --> 01:32.725
And another thing-

01:32.760 --> 01:35.228
don't talk about him
like that

01:35.263 --> 01:37.113
when he can hear you.

01:37.148 --> 01:38.364
Rip's got feelings.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.233
I don't want them hurt.

01:42.118 --> 01:44.621
I'll let him
in the house,

01:44.656 --> 01:47.740
and i'll feed him,
but i'll be switched

01:47.775 --> 01:51.494
if i'm going to start
sweet-talking him.

01:51.529 --> 01:53.997
Old woman,
you tickle me sometimes.

01:54.032 --> 01:58.384
Uh, when's the last time
you got yourself kissed?

01:59.636 --> 02:01.504
Well, the way
i figure it,

02:01.539 --> 02:05.258
it was in the spring of
nineteen and twenty-four.

02:05.892 --> 02:08.394
Well, i figure
you got one coming.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.263
Don't you come
near me, old man.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.148
Yes, sir,
i've been thinking

02:12.183 --> 02:14.017
about giving you a kiss

02:14.052 --> 02:15.268
for the last
month or two.

02:15.303 --> 02:18.404
Oh, hyder, you sit down
and eat your supper

02:18.439 --> 02:20.273
and stop talking silly.

02:22.775 --> 02:25.278
I'll have my supper
now, old woman.

02:28.414 --> 02:29.666
There you are.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.288
Old man...

02:35.323 --> 02:37.790
i never said
this to you...

02:39.676 --> 02:43.429
...but we have
endured powerful well

02:43.464 --> 02:45.932
over the years together.

02:45.967 --> 02:47.183
Hmm?

02:47.218 --> 02:50.303
Nearly 50 years
we've been married, eh?

02:50.338 --> 02:51.554
Come october 16.

02:51.589 --> 02:55.058
Long time to travel together.

02:55.093 --> 02:57.810
Well, i wouldn't have had it
any other way.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.196
Thank you, old woman.

03:00.231 --> 03:01.447
Me neither.

03:02.699 --> 03:04.567
Here, rip.

03:05.201 --> 03:07.070
I'll feed that dog
after supper.

03:07.704 --> 03:10.206
He ain't going to be
here after supper.

03:10.241 --> 03:12.075
Where's he going?

03:12.110 --> 03:13.576
Where i'm going-
coon hunting.

03:13.611 --> 03:16.462
Oh, hyder.

03:17.964 --> 03:20.466
I wish you wouldn't
go hunting tonight.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.718
Why not?

03:21.753 --> 03:22.969
Well, three
nights ago,

03:23.004 --> 03:24.837
i saw blood
on the moon.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.340
You ought to have been
in bed sleeping.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.225
You wouldn't have seen it.

03:29.260 --> 03:31.344
And two days ago,
a bird flew in the house

03:31.978 --> 03:35.732
and lit on your side of the bed
and nearly scared me to death.

03:35.767 --> 03:40.353
There you go,
trying to spoil a good hunt.

03:40.388 --> 03:43.239
Well,
i'm a-going anyways.

03:43.274 --> 03:45.358
Them signs
don't bother me at all.

03:45.393 --> 03:49.112
Well, they bother me.

03:54.152 --> 03:56.002
Now, you be careful,
old man.

03:56.619 --> 03:59.122
Don't you worry
about me, old woman.

03:59.157 --> 04:02.875
I'll be back even before
midnight, more'n likely.

04:02.910 --> 04:06.512
An old man
and a hound dog named rip

04:06.547 --> 04:09.515
off for an evening's pleasure
in quest of raccoon.

04:10.133 --> 04:11.384
Usually, these evenings end

04:11.419 --> 04:15.138
with one tired old man,
one battle-scarred hound dog

04:15.173 --> 04:17.640
and one or more
extremely dead raccoons,

04:18.274 --> 04:22.028
but as you may suspect, that
will not be the case tonight.

04:22.063 --> 04:25.782
These hunters won't be
coming home from the hill.

04:25.817 --> 04:29.535
They're headed for the backwoods
of the twilight zone.

04:59.732 --> 05:01.601
Smell him out there, boy.

05:01.636 --> 05:03.486
He's around here somewheres.

05:03.521 --> 05:05.355
You can get him.

05:38.521 --> 05:41.641
Tree'd him, didn't you, boy?

05:49.899 --> 05:52.402
Rip,
don't want to doubt your word,

05:52.437 --> 05:54.654
but there ain't
no coon up there.

06:00.043 --> 06:02.412
Trick ya, didn't he, boy?

06:23.433 --> 06:25.435
Hold it back
there, rip.

06:25.470 --> 06:27.320
Come back
here, rip!

06:27.355 --> 06:29.572
Don't go
in there!

06:29.607 --> 06:31.441
I'll pull you out, rip!

06:31.476 --> 06:32.692
Come back here, rip!

06:32.727 --> 06:34.577
Hold on, hold on there, rip.

06:34.612 --> 06:35.828
Come back here!

06:35.863 --> 06:37.697
That coon'll drown you, rip.

06:38.948 --> 06:40.700
That coon's got him down.

06:40.735 --> 06:41.951
Huh! I'm coming, rip.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.841
I'm coming, rip, hold it!

06:53.212 --> 06:54.714
I'm coming!

07:56.776 --> 07:58.027
Rip...

07:58.062 --> 08:01.781
we must have trailed
that coon half the night.

08:01.816 --> 08:03.666
Hungry, ain't you, boy?

08:03.701 --> 08:05.535
Yeah, me, too.

08:05.570 --> 08:08.037
So let's mosey along home

08:08.072 --> 08:11.174
and see what rachel's got
for breakfast.

08:13.676 --> 08:17.430
That old woman gives us
"hail, columbia"

08:17.465 --> 08:19.298
for staying out all night.

08:38.951 --> 08:41.453
I figure that's
about deep enough.

08:41.489 --> 08:43.322
That ain't more
than three feet.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.825
Three feet's deep
enough for a dog.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.460
Any ordinary dog, maybe,

08:47.495 --> 08:49.328
but according
to old man simpson,

08:49.363 --> 08:51.214
rip ain't no ordinary dog.

08:51.249 --> 08:52.832
Then you dig it.

08:58.838 --> 09:02.592
It'll be kind of lonesome around
here without old man simpson.

09:08.481 --> 09:11.484
Morning, boys.

09:11.519 --> 09:15.738
Reckon them miller boys
gotten hard of hearing.

09:24.997 --> 09:26.866
What you old boys up to?

09:28.618 --> 09:30.119
Say, what you doing?

09:31.754 --> 09:34.123
All right,
don't answer me, then.

09:34.158 --> 09:37.260
I don't give a hoot
what you're doing.

09:37.295 --> 09:38.878
If i ain't mistaken,

09:38.913 --> 09:42.014
you're digging this hole
on my land.

09:42.049 --> 09:46.385
Now, if you want to dig,
dig on your side of the fence.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.638
Get moving.

09:49.639 --> 09:51.524
I say get moving!

09:53.142 --> 09:56.279
I ain't talking
just to move the wind around.

09:56.314 --> 09:57.530
You get a move on

09:58.147 --> 10:01.284
or i'm going to fill your
britches full of lead!

10:01.319 --> 10:04.036
I figure that's just
about deep enough.

10:07.790 --> 10:08.791
Have a little care.

10:08.826 --> 10:10.660
It's just a dog.

10:10.695 --> 10:11.544
Not to some folks.

10:14.914 --> 10:18.167
Why didn't you tell me
you'd lost a dog?

10:18.202 --> 10:19.418
How'd it happen?

10:25.675 --> 10:28.811
Don't reckon i blame you
for not talking.

10:28.846 --> 10:31.931
I don't reckon i would myself.

10:31.966 --> 10:35.935
Well, rip, we're butting in
on other folks' troubles.

10:35.970 --> 10:38.187
They're just
too heartbroke to talk.

10:40.690 --> 10:42.575
And speaking of trouble,

10:42.610 --> 10:46.329
that old woman's going to have
plenty of that for us.

10:46.364 --> 10:47.330
Come on.

10:55.489 --> 10:59.208
Looks to me like, rip, maybe
we got us a stroke of luck.

10:59.243 --> 11:01.711
Could be the old woman's
still sleeping.

11:09.468 --> 11:11.971
Morning.

11:19.612 --> 11:22.732
All dressed up
like the fourth of july.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.485
Old woman,
if you're figuring

11:26.520 --> 11:29.622
on leaving me on account
on i stayed out all night,

11:29.657 --> 11:32.124
you got another thing coming.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.993
Lord be with
you, sister.

11:35.244 --> 11:37.129
Amen, brother.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.632
I appreciate your coming,

11:39.667 --> 11:41.500
even though he
didn't belong

11:41.535 --> 11:42.134
to the church.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.637
I just never could
get him to go.

11:44.672 --> 11:47.139
I realize
brother simpson

11:47.174 --> 11:48.391
wasn't a
religious man,

11:48.426 --> 11:50.259
but i figure he's
still entitled

11:50.294 --> 11:52.144
to a christian
burial.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.013
Now, just...
just hold everything.

11:54.048 --> 11:57.767
Anybody's going to give
brother simpson a burial

11:57.802 --> 12:00.903
you'd better ask brother simpson
how he feels about it.

12:00.938 --> 12:03.522
I just been sitting here...

12:03.557 --> 12:06.025
trying to figure it out.

12:08.277 --> 12:10.780
It was just
last night.

12:10.815 --> 12:14.417
He was sitting there
at the supper table.

12:14.452 --> 12:16.285
I begged him not to go.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.173
There's
been omens.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.676
I've seen signs.

12:25.044 --> 12:26.295
But he went.

12:26.330 --> 12:29.799
The lord works in
mysterious ways.

12:29.834 --> 12:32.301
Rachel,
listen to me-

12:32.336 --> 12:36.055
there's been
a misunderstanding.

12:38.941 --> 12:40.192
Miss rachel,

12:40.227 --> 12:42.061
if you're ready, ma'am.

12:44.563 --> 12:46.449
Well, he's in there.

12:56.459 --> 12:57.710
Oh...

13:01.330 --> 13:03.833
don't take on,
old woman.

13:03.868 --> 13:05.718
It's just a dream.

13:05.753 --> 13:07.586
We'll wake up in a little

13:07.621 --> 13:11.340
and everything'll be
like it ought to be.

13:14.226 --> 13:16.729
What you old boys
got in there?

13:19.849 --> 13:22.351
What you old boys
taking out of there?

13:22.985 --> 13:24.236
Oh!

13:24.271 --> 13:26.105
Who's in that box?

14:06.245 --> 14:08.497
We'll find out
what all this is about

14:08.532 --> 14:09.748
in a minute or two, rip.

14:09.783 --> 14:12.885
The graveyard's just over
the top of the hill there.

14:45.284 --> 14:52.174
Now, who in the tarnation
built this fence up here?

14:52.209 --> 14:54.043
Rip, we must have taken
a wrong turn.

14:54.078 --> 14:58.430
I don't memorize
ever seeing this fence before.

14:59.682 --> 15:02.801
Well, we're bound
to come out somewhere.

15:19.702 --> 15:20.953
Hello!

15:20.988 --> 15:22.204
Anybody home in there?

15:24.707 --> 15:25.958
Howdy, neighbor.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.209
Howdy.

15:27.244 --> 15:29.712
I wasn't expecting
nobody this morning.

15:29.747 --> 15:32.831
Don't want to put you
to no trouble, friend,

15:32.866 --> 15:34.717
but it seems like
i lost my way.

15:34.752 --> 15:37.219
That's what everybody
says at first.

15:37.254 --> 15:39.088
Now, what's
your name, friend?

15:39.123 --> 15:41.340
Simpson- hyder simpson.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.726
I belong to that
bunch of simpsons

15:43.761 --> 15:46.228
lives over on
whale's mountain.

15:46.263 --> 15:47.479
Rip and me here-

15:47.514 --> 15:49.848
we never have traveled
this far before.

15:50.482 --> 15:51.850
Never have
traveled so far

15:51.885 --> 15:54.353
we couldn't see the top
of whale's mountain.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.855
How old are you,
neighbor simpson?

15:56.890 --> 15:59.358
Well, sir, i been
walking the earth

15:59.393 --> 16:01.243
for something
like 70 year now.

16:01.278 --> 16:03.112
Arrived at the gate,
uh, 10:45...

16:03.147 --> 16:05.614
i know it's none
of my business,

16:05.649 --> 16:06.865
but would you tell me

16:06.900 --> 16:09.368
what you're writing
down in that book?

16:09.403 --> 16:11.620
One more thing,
neighbor simpson-

16:11.655 --> 16:12.871
how'd you die?

16:12.906 --> 16:16.625
I was born
with a cheap set of ears.

16:16.660 --> 16:19.762
I'm not sure i heard you right.

16:19.797 --> 16:21.630
I said, "how did you die?"

16:22.264 --> 16:23.515
Who claims i'm dead?

16:23.632 --> 16:26.769
You wouldn't be here
if you wasn't dead.

16:26.804 --> 16:28.771
Man, that's solid
flesh and bone there.

16:28.806 --> 16:30.639
You feel that.

16:30.674 --> 16:31.890
Think back, neighbor.

16:31.925 --> 16:33.525
What did you do last night?

16:33.560 --> 16:37.146
Well, sir, i'll tell you
exactly what i done.

16:37.181 --> 16:40.282
Me and rip, we left the house
long about suppertime,

16:40.899 --> 16:42.785
and rip,
he picked up

16:42.820 --> 16:45.287
a coon trail
right away,

16:45.322 --> 16:48.157
and like a coon will,
it headed for the water

16:48.192 --> 16:50.042
and rip didn't do nothing

16:50.409 --> 16:51.660
but go in
after him.

16:51.794 --> 16:53.662
About that time, i got there,

16:53.697 --> 16:57.416
and i was running out
on this log and i...

17:06.925 --> 17:10.679
hey, friend, what's
on the other side

17:10.714 --> 17:12.564
of that gate there?

17:12.598 --> 17:14.316
Well, that pasture
right up there

17:14.351 --> 17:16.185
they call
the elysian field.

17:16.220 --> 17:17.819
Cross that and you come
to the golden street

17:18.436 --> 17:20.321
that takes you right
to the celestial palace

17:20.357 --> 17:22.191
where the old master
has his headquarters.

17:22.226 --> 17:25.327
Then i take you would aim
to be st. Peter.

17:25.362 --> 17:27.695
I keep the gate, that's a fact.

17:27.731 --> 17:30.582
Well, i'm mighty proud
to have met up with you.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.835
Just as proud to have you here.

17:34.953 --> 17:36.205
I always thought

17:36.240 --> 17:39.341
there was a lot of singing
and dancing in heaven.

17:39.958 --> 17:41.844
How come i don't hear no music?

17:41.879 --> 17:43.462
You're on the outside.

17:43.497 --> 17:46.598
Once inside, you'll hear
your favorite hymn.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.968
Well, i don't care much
for hymn singing.

17:50.003 --> 17:51.854
I favor guitar music myself.

17:51.889 --> 17:54.356
Don't stand out here
in the cold, cold world.

17:54.391 --> 17:56.225
Reap your
heavenly reward.

17:56.260 --> 17:57.476
Come on, rip.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.228
Hold on, neighbor.

17:59.263 --> 17:59.862
You can't take
that dog in there.

17:59.897 --> 18:01.730
There ain't no fleas
on that dog.

18:01.765 --> 18:04.233
That don't make no nevermind.
He can't come in.

18:04.268 --> 18:05.234
How come?

18:05.269 --> 18:06.485
This is
folks' heaven.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.488
There's a place we can put him,
though, up the road.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.373
You just tie him
to the fence,

18:11.408 --> 18:13.242
and i'll walk
him up later on.

18:13.277 --> 18:14.493
Come on, rip.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.378
Hold on,
neighbor simpson.

18:16.413 --> 18:18.247
Where do you think
you're going?

18:18.282 --> 18:22.000
Thank you, but i don't reckon
in there is any place for me.

18:22.035 --> 18:23.001
Why not?

18:23.036 --> 18:24.753
Well, any place

18:24.788 --> 18:27.890
that's too highfalutin for rip
is too fancy for me.

18:27.925 --> 18:30.392
How thoroughbred
does a dog have to be

18:30.427 --> 18:32.895
before you let him
in there, anyway?

18:32.930 --> 18:35.397
Ain't no dogs allowed at all.

18:35.432 --> 18:38.016
What kind of outfit
don't allow no dogs?

18:38.051 --> 18:40.652
They got that special place
for dogs.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.905
Me and rip will go on
down there, then.

18:42.940 --> 18:44.156
You won't get in.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.908
The dog, maybe, but not you.

18:45.943 --> 18:49.027
What kind of heaven would it be
with just dogs?

18:49.062 --> 18:52.164
A dog's got a right
to have a man around

18:52.199 --> 18:55.918
just the same as a man's got
a right to have a dog around,

18:55.953 --> 18:57.786
if he wants to be happy.

18:57.821 --> 18:59.171
Neighbor, let me make you
a little proposition.

18:59.206 --> 19:02.291
Why don't you go on in the gate,
and a little later on,

19:02.326 --> 19:04.176
i'll slip the dog
through the fence to you.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.044
It's breaking the rules,
but i'll do it.

19:06.079 --> 19:08.180
Friend peter,
if i go in that front gate,

19:08.797 --> 19:11.300
rip's going in
that front gate likewise.

19:11.335 --> 19:15.053
I don't want him to get to
feeling that he ain't welcome.

19:15.088 --> 19:16.555
I got another idea.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.056
What are you doing there,
mister?

19:18.091 --> 19:19.942
I'll hold on
to your dog

19:19.977 --> 19:21.810
and let you see
how you like it.

19:21.845 --> 19:24.813
I don't have to go inside
to make up my mind.

19:24.848 --> 19:27.316
Let me ask you
a practical question:

19:27.351 --> 19:31.703
What kind of coon hunting would
i have in there without rip?

19:31.738 --> 19:34.072
Man, they don't allow
no coon hunting.

19:34.107 --> 19:36.575
Oh, you don't say.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.460
Where do you think
you're going?

19:38.495 --> 19:39.711
Me and rip's
going somewhere.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.580
There ain't no
place else to go.

19:41.615 --> 19:44.082
We'll go wherever
that road takes us.

19:44.117 --> 19:45.968
Oh, that road
don't lead nowhere.

19:46.003 --> 19:47.586
This is eternity road.

19:47.621 --> 19:50.722
It just keeps on,
never stops, leads nowhere.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.341
Me and rip'll do all right.

19:52.376 --> 19:56.094
Neighbor, this
is a right serious
step you're taking.

19:56.129 --> 19:57.346
I'd say the best thing

19:57.381 --> 19:59.848
is to sit out there
and think it over.

19:59.883 --> 20:02.351
You've got all eternity
to make up your mind.

20:02.386 --> 20:03.352
Good day to you, sir.

20:03.986 --> 20:06.488
If you change your mind,
just let me know.

20:06.523 --> 20:07.739
Much obliged.

20:07.774 --> 20:08.991
I'll do that.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.769
Eternity's a powerful
long spell to go

20:37.804 --> 20:40.272
without a coon hunt,
ain't it, rip?

20:40.307 --> 20:44.142
Don't you go off your feed
or nothing over this thing.

20:44.177 --> 20:47.279
Wouldn't surprise me none
if i don't sneak in there

20:47.314 --> 20:49.781
and talk to the judge,
or somebody.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.284
Might be able to get you in.

20:52.319 --> 20:56.788
Wonder what kind of a tea party
they keep in there, anyways.

20:56.823 --> 21:00.542
Must be city folks, mostly.

21:00.577 --> 21:04.296
They'd be the ones most likely
to outlaw coon hunting.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.415
Let them sit in there

21:06.450 --> 21:07.916
tootin' on their harps

21:07.951 --> 21:11.053
or whatever they do
for relaxation,

21:11.088 --> 21:12.921
me and youse stays together.

21:12.956 --> 21:17.809
Just like we was when
we was traveling down below.

21:17.844 --> 21:21.430
Hmm...

21:21.465 --> 21:22.814
least we ain't
the only ones

21:22.849 --> 21:24.066
wandering
around

21:24.101 --> 21:26.568
by ourselves
on the eternity road.

21:27.569 --> 21:28.820
Howdy, son.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.072
Howdy.

21:31.940 --> 21:33.191
Ah...

21:33.226 --> 21:35.077
i'm looking for
a mr. Hyder simpson

21:35.694 --> 21:37.579
and a hound dog
name of rip.

21:37.614 --> 21:38.830
Well, that's us.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.699
Well, i figured it was.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.584
Well, if you
and rip's all set,

21:42.619 --> 21:44.453
we might as well
mosey along.

21:44.488 --> 21:46.204
Mosey along where?

21:46.239 --> 21:48.090
Heaven, mr. Simpson.

21:48.125 --> 21:50.959
Well, now, like i told
that other fellow,

21:50.994 --> 21:54.096
i ain't going to set foot
in heaven without rip.

21:54.131 --> 21:56.715
You didn't get messed up
with nobody in there, did you?

21:56.750 --> 21:58.600
That fellow at the gate.

21:58.635 --> 22:01.720
He wouldn't let rip in,
so i didn't go.

22:01.755 --> 22:02.971
Son...

22:03.006 --> 22:05.474
that'd be a hell of a place
without rip.

22:05.509 --> 22:07.359
Mr. Simpson...

22:07.394 --> 22:09.227
you ain't far wrong.

22:09.262 --> 22:11.613
Thatishell.

22:11.648 --> 22:14.116
Heaven's up
yonder apiece.

22:14.151 --> 22:15.367
Well, i'll
be jiggered.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.235
Now, how come
that fellow

22:17.270 --> 22:19.121
would want
to lie to me?

22:19.156 --> 22:20.989
Well, they don't
never give up.

22:21.024 --> 22:23.492
Always trying to get
folks in there

22:23.527 --> 22:25.377
right down
to the last minute.

22:25.412 --> 22:27.879
Well, what reason
would they have

22:27.914 --> 22:29.748
for wanting
to keep rip out?

22:29.783 --> 22:32.501
They was a-feared
rip would have warned you.

22:32.536 --> 22:36.254
And he would have, time he got
a whiff of that brimstone.

22:36.289 --> 22:38.507
You see, mr. Simpson,

22:38.542 --> 22:43.261
a man- well, he'll walk right
into hell with both eyes open,

22:43.296 --> 22:46.398
but even the devil
can't fool a dog.

22:48.266 --> 22:50.402
You wouldn't be st. Peter,
would you?

22:50.437 --> 22:54.656
Oh, no, no, i... i'm just
a regular angel here.

22:54.691 --> 22:57.159
Well, where's your wings, son?

22:57.194 --> 23:01.029
Shucks, i don't use
them half the time.

23:01.064 --> 23:03.532
I appreciate
walking myself.

23:03.567 --> 23:04.783
You, uh...

23:04.818 --> 23:06.668
about ready to go,
mr. Simpson?

23:06.703 --> 23:09.171
Uh... uh, rip.

23:12.924 --> 23:14.793
How's the coon hunting
up here, boy?

23:14.828 --> 23:16.678
Oh, just fine,
mr. Simpson.

23:16.713 --> 23:17.929
There's one tonight

23:17.964 --> 23:19.798
right after
the square dance.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.049
Want to come along?

23:21.084 --> 23:22.934
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

23:24.803 --> 23:27.305
Welcome to heaven,
mr. Simpson.

23:29.057 --> 23:30.942
Thank you, son.

23:30.977 --> 23:33.445
Right proud to be here.

23:35.313 --> 23:37.816
Uh, rachel-
that's my old woman-

23:37.851 --> 23:39.701
she won't have any trouble

23:39.736 --> 23:43.455
getting past that fellow
up the road, will she?

23:43.490 --> 23:45.207
Rachel? No, not her.

23:45.242 --> 23:48.960
And she'll be along
directly, too, i'm told.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.079
Well, glad to hear it.

23:52.464 --> 23:54.332
Come along, rip.

23:54.367 --> 23:58.086
Travelers to unknown regions
would be well advised

23:58.121 --> 24:00.589
to take along the family dog.

24:00.624 --> 24:04.342
He could just save you
from entering the wrong gate.

24:04.377 --> 24:06.845
At least,
it happened that way once

24:06.880 --> 24:09.981
in a mountainous area
of the twilight zone.

24:13.685 --> 24:16.438
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

24:16.473 --> 24:18.940
will tell you
about next week's story

24:18.975 --> 24:22.027
after this message.

24:22.577 --> 24:24.079
And now, mr. Serling.

24:24.114 --> 24:26.581
Next week we offer you
a hollywood television cowboy

24:26.616 --> 24:29.701
who takes in several bills
a week for killing off bad men.

24:29.736 --> 24:32.204
Mr. Larry blyden portrays
one of these phony balonies

24:32.838 --> 24:34.089
who always wins in the end.

24:34.124 --> 24:36.591
But in this little item
he draws from the hip

24:36.626 --> 24:39.711
and realizes his opponent
is smack-dab out of this world.

24:39.746 --> 24:42.214
We invite your attention to
"showdown with rance mcgrew,"

24:42.848 --> 24:47.219
next week's stagecoach sojourn
in the twilight zone.

25:16.731 --> 25:19.217
This is an age
of amazing feats,

25:19.252 --> 25:22.837
and the fuel
that has kept us going is faith.

25:22.872 --> 25:24.973
Worship together this week.
