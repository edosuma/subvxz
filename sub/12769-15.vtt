A PLANE RIDE AWAY?

00:19.000 --> 00:21.583
WELL, SHE SAID THAT THE DEAN
OF ADMISSIONS CALLED HER

00:21.625 --> 00:24.208
"PERFECT COLUMBIA MATERIAL."
WHICH MAKES ME PROUD,

00:24.250 --> 00:26.959
BUT DO--DO YOU WANT OLIVIA
A PLANE RIDE AWAY?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.041

SHE'S GONNA STAY
A FEW MORE DAYS

GET READY TO MOVE OUT.
SHE HOLDIN' UP?

00:40.083 --> 00:42.125
SOUNDS LIKE IT, YEAH.

00:42.166 --> 00:43.959
HOW ABOUT YOU?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.959
WELL, THINGS HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE CRAZY

FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF,

00:59.625 --> 01:01.792
YOU KEEP HER UP LATER
THAN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO.
(laughs)

01:01.834 --> 01:03.917
YOU DO. YOU KNOW YOU DO.

01:03.959 --> 01:07.041

NEEDS SOME COMPANY...

01:14.083 --> 01:17.875
(laughs)
WHY DON'T WE PICK A NIGHT,
AND I'LL COME BACK,

01:17.917 --> 01:21.458
AND WE'LL PUT HER DOWN ON TIME,
AND THEN I'LL COOK DINNER?

01:21.500 --> 01:23.458
WHAT IF WE KEEP HER UP
A LITTLE LATER

01:23.500 --> 01:25.792

YOU KNOW I HAD TO REWRITE
THE MANUSCRIPT.

01:48.083 --> 01:50.959
THE PUBLISHER ASKED ME
TO GO DEEPER, AND TO DO THAT,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.500
I HAD TO SHARE ALL MY STORIES
AND--AND THE PEOPLE IN THEM.

01:53.542 --> 01:55.208
GOING DEEPER INTO YOUR LIFE
IS FINE.

01:55.250 --> 01:57.458

IS NOT.
BUT YOU'RE A PART

02:30.625 --> 02:33.834
SHE GOT QUIET
AND SHE SEEMED CONFUSED,

02:33.875 --> 02:35.834

02:35.875 --> 02:38.750

MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER

02:57.083 --> 03:00.041
WE WERE, UH, DRIVING TO DINNER
WITH MY PARENTS.

03:00.083 --> 03:01.917
IT WAS RAINING.

03:01.959 --> 03:04.041
A CAR BARRELED THROUGH
THE INTERSECTION.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.041
OUR PARENTS DIED.
WE SURVIVED.

03:06.083 --> 03:09.041
AND IT TOOK
A LOT OF THERAPY,

03:09.083 --> 03:11.041
BUT I'M--
I'M WITH HER EVERYDAY.

03:11.083 --> 03:13.875
I HAVEN'T SEEN
ANOTHER PERSONALITY IN...

03:13.917 --> 03:16.000
ALMOST TEN YEARS.

03:21.083 --> 03:23.041
I HAD ALREADY
TUCKED TANYA IN

03:23.083 --> 03:25.041
AND WAS GETTING READY
FOR BED MYSELF

03:25.083 --> 03:27.041
WHEN I HEARD THESE NOISES
COMING FROM HER ROOM.

03:27.083 --> 03:29.041
SOMETIMES
SHE LIKES TO STAY UP,

03:29.083 --> 03:31.667
PLAYING WITH HER STUFFED
ANIMALS, BUT WHEN I WENT IN...
IT WAS JUST RICKY.

03:31.709 --> 03:34.750
WHO'S RICKY?
MY FRIEND.
WE GO TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.

03:34.792 --> 03:37.041
YEAH.
(whispers) THEY WERE
HAVING SEX, DR. BENNETT.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.417

03:38.458 --> 03:41.250
(normal voice) APPARENTLY,
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE.

03:41.291 --> 03:43.500
DON'T TELL YOUR MOM.
OH.

03:43.542 --> 03:46.208
(laughs)
SHE'D BEEN COMPLAINING
OF STOMACH PAINS.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.875
I DIDN'T KNOW WHY,
AND NOW...

03:48.917 --> 03:50.875
(whispers) I THINK SHE NEEDS
A PREGNANCY TEST.

03:50.917 --> 03:52.875
OH, WELL, STOMACH PAINS
COULD MEAN ANYTHING.

03:52.917 --> 03:54.875
IT COULD BE THE FLU,
IT COULD BE APPENDICITIS.

03:54.917 --> 03:56.041
PLEASE.

03:56.083 --> 03:57.291

LIE BACK FOR ME, OKAY?

03:59.333 --> 04:01.041
I'M GONNA CHECK YOUR BELLY.

04:01.083 --> 04:03.041
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CHECK
MY HEART?

04:03.083 --> 04:05.041
I KNOW I NORMALLY DO
CHECK YOUR HEART,

04:05.083 --> 04:07.417
BUT TODAY, I'M GONNA LOOK
INSIDE YOUR BELLY

04:07.458 --> 04:09.041
WITH A SPECIAL MACHINE.

04:09.083 --> 04:13.291
THIS MAY BE A LITTLE CHILLY.
YOU READY? MM.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.208
YUCK.
I KNOW.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.125
YOU KNOW HOW CLOSELY
I WATCH HER.

04:17.166 --> 04:19.458
ERIN, YOU ARE A GREAT MOTHER,
AND OF A TEENAGER,

04:19.500 --> 04:22.917
WHICH MEANS HORMONES AND...

04:22.959 --> 04:25.542
WHAT'S IN MY BELLY?

04:25.583 --> 04:27.667
OH, GOD.

04:40.083 --> 04:44.041
LARA'S BEEN TAKING CARE OF ME
SINCE OUR PARENTS DIED.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.041
SHE HAD JUST TURNED 18,
AND SUDDENLY,

04:46.083 --> 04:49.041
SHE WAS LOOKING AFTER
A 7 YEAR OLD FULL-TIME.

04:49.083 --> 04:51.041
WHICH IS HOW
SHE STILL TREATS ME.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.542
SHE'S A BIG SISTER.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.166
YEAH, BUT IT'S
ALMOST 20 YEARS LATER.

04:55.208 --> 04:57.959
I HAVE A JOB.
I PAY MY BILLS.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.041
SHE CAN'T
WORRY ABOUT ME FOREVER.

05:01.083 --> 05:04.000
LOSING YOUR PARENTS
AT SUCH AN EARLY AGE

05:04.041 --> 05:05.750
IS A SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA.

05:05.792 --> 05:09.792
AND I THINK SHE'S WORRIED
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE COPING.

05:09.834 --> 05:12.000
MEANING, SHE'S WORRIED
ABOUT MY OTHERS.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.375
SHE MENTIONED THEM.

05:13.417 --> 05:15.041
BUT SHE ALSO SAID

05:15.083 --> 05:17.667
THAT THEY HAD GONE AWAY
FOR A LONG TIME.

05:17.709 --> 05:19.542
YEAH.

05:19.583 --> 05:22.041
IT'S OKAY, ANDI.

05:22.083 --> 05:24.000
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

05:26.083 --> 05:28.041
LARA SAID
THAT YOU WERE HAVING DINNER

05:28.083 --> 05:30.750
WHEN ONE
OF YOUR OTHERS APPEARED.

05:30.792 --> 05:32.750
DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT?

05:32.792 --> 05:34.041
(sighs) NO. I BLACK OUT.

05:34.083 --> 05:37.000
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY OR DO.

05:37.041 --> 05:39.041
IT'S AWFUL.

05:39.083 --> 05:41.375
SO YOU
CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING?

05:41.417 --> 05:43.417
NOT REALLY.

05:43.458 --> 05:45.583
NOTHING AT ALL?

05:47.834 --> 05:49.583
ANDI?

05:52.458 --> 05:56.041
SHE ANSWERED THE QUESTION,
JACKASS.

05:56.083 --> 05:58.000
MY NAME IS GINA.

05:58.041 --> 06:01.875
AND YOU NEED
TO BACK THE HELL OFF!

06:01.917 --> 06:03.875
(Cooper)
I THINK SHRINKS ARE GOOD.

06:03.917 --> 06:05.917
I THINK TALKING IS GOOD,

06:05.959 --> 06:08.000
AND CHARLOTTE AND I
AS A COUPLE, WE'RE...

06:08.041 --> 06:09.208
(woman) GOOD.

06:09.250 --> 06:12.208
BUT HERE YOU ARE, SO I HAVE TO
ASSUME THERE ARE SOME ISSUES.

06:12.250 --> 06:13.959
WE DON'T HAVE ISSUES.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.208
WELL, NO BIG ONES.

06:19.083 --> 06:21.041
UH...

06:21.083 --> 06:23.041
SHE WON'T WEAR
HER ENGAGEMENT RING.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.000
IT WAS BROKEN, AND I HAD IT
FIXED AND POLISHED.

06:26.041 --> 06:27.500
HOW DID IT BREAK?

06:27.542 --> 06:29.041
I WAS RAPED.

06:29.083 --> 06:31.041
THE ATTACKER
BROKE MY LEFT HAND.

06:31.083 --> 06:33.041
THEY HAD TO CUT IT OFF
AT THE HOSPITAL.

06:33.083 --> 06:36.041
WELL, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU.

06:36.083 --> 06:37.709
THE RING'S A REMINDER.

06:39.083 --> 06:41.041
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

06:41.083 --> 06:43.041
I'LL BUY YOU ANOTHER ONE.
I DON'T WANT ANOTHER ONE.

06:43.083 --> 06:45.834
YOU CAN'T WEAR THE ONE YOU HAVE,
BUT YOU DON'T WANT ANOTHER ONE?

06:45.875 --> 06:47.500
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

06:47.542 --> 06:51.041
WELL, IT SEEMS WE DO HAVE
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.875
(exhales)
(Sheldon) I MEAN, ONE MINUTE,
SHE'S TALKING CALMLY,

06:53.917 --> 06:56.709
AND THEN BAM. SHE'S YELLING
OBSCENITIES AT ME.
ANDI?

06:56.750 --> 06:59.041
GINA. HER ALTER.

06:59.083 --> 07:00.417
WHAT WAS SHE MAD AT?

07:00.458 --> 07:02.750
ME. SHE THOUGHT I WAS ATTACKING
LARA AND HER FIANCé.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.250
I MEAN,
GINA'S VERY PROTECTIVE.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.917
AND HOW DID YOU KNOW
IT WASN'T ANDI?

07:06.959 --> 07:08.125
THE TRANSFORMATION
WAS REMARKABLE--

07:08.166 --> 07:10.959
THE--THE INFLECTION,
THE--THE CHANGE IN HER POSTURE.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.750
AND YOU'RE SURE
SHE WASN'T FAKING IT?
EVERY WOMAN DOES.

07:13.792 --> 07:15.417
NO, THAT'S... WE'RE TALKING

07:15.458 --> 07:17.959
ABOUT A PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE
PERSONALITY DISORDER, NOT, UH...

07:18.041 --> 07:20.917
ORGASMS. GOTCHA.

07:20.959 --> 07:24.959
IS THAT EVEN REAL--
THE WHOLE SYBIL THING?
GINA'S VERY CONVINCING,
AND SHE WAS NOT HAPPY

07:25.000 --> 07:27.959
THAT I WAS POKING AROUND
IN ANDI'S HEAD.
WELL, CAN'T BLAME HER
FOR THAT.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.917
OH, SAYS THE GIRL WHO DELIGHTS
IN DRILLING HOLES IN SKULLS.

07:29.959 --> 07:32.083
WELL, AT LEAST WHAT I DO
IS ROOTED IN SCIENCE.

07:32.125 --> 07:35.041
THERE IS PET-SCAN DATA
EVIDENCING NEUROLOGICAL CHANGES

07:35.083 --> 07:36.959
IN THE BRAINS OF PATIENTS
WITH M.P.D.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.917
ONE. ONE STUDY, AND IT IS
RIGHT UP THERE WITH THAT WACKO

07:39.959 --> 07:42.125
WHO SAID THAT VACCINATING
YOUR KID CAUSES AUTISM.

07:42.166 --> 07:45.041
I AM NOT SAYING I DON'T BELIEVE
IN DISSOCIATED BEHAVIOR.

07:45.083 --> 07:48.333
I-I-I'VE HAD PATIENTS WITH
BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDERS

07:48.375 --> 07:50.333
WHO--WHO ACT OUT,
WHO--WHO TRY TO MANIPULATE.

07:50.375 --> 07:55.041
BUT IT'S USUALLY
FOR, UH, FOR PERSONAL GAIN.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.041
YOU... (laughs) OKAY, NO.

07:57.083 --> 08:00.333
I'M SORRY. I KNOW THIS IS
TOTALLY UNCOOL OF ME TO ASK,

08:00.375 --> 08:03.000
BUT, UM...
(inhales and exhales deeply)

08:03.041 --> 08:05.041
HAVE EITHER OF YOU
READ MY MANUSCRIPT?

08:05.083 --> 08:07.834
THE ONE WHERE YOU BASICALLY
CALL ME A WHORE?

08:07.875 --> 08:10.208
YEP, I READ IT.

08:10.250 --> 08:13.041
THAT'S NOT WHAT I-I--NO.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.041
Y-YOU HAVE A CERTAIN
SEXUAL CONFIDENCE,

08:15.083 --> 08:17.041
WHICH--WHICH IS GREAT.

08:17.083 --> 08:19.291
AND I WAS TRYING TO
CONTRAST THAT WITH THE FACT

08:19.333 --> 08:22.709
THAT I HAD SOME, UH, ISSUES
WITH INTIMACY AFTER THE ATTACK.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.041
AH.
WELL, Y-YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT,
DIDN'T YOU?

08:25.083 --> 08:27.041
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
TO THAT PART.

08:27.083 --> 08:29.542
I'M STILL ENJOYING THE SECTION
WHERE YOU'RE DISCUSSING

08:29.583 --> 08:32.750
CHEATING ON PETE WITH ME
AND THEN CHUCKING ME OVERBOARD.

08:32.792 --> 08:35.709
NOT THAT I DON'T ENJOY BEING
DESCRIBED AS "REBOUND SEX."

08:35.750 --> 08:38.333
SHELDON, I NEVER SAID--
I BELIEVE "SEXUAL LEFTOVERS"
WAS YOUR PHRASE.

08:38.375 --> 08:41.542
I MEAN, HONESTLY, VIOLET, IF
YOU'RE GONNA GO DOWN THAT ROAD,

08:41.583 --> 08:43.041
THE LEAST YOU COULD HAVE DONE

08:43.083 --> 08:45.208
IS DISCUSS
MY MORE POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES.

08:45.250 --> 08:48.041
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE BOOKS
IN YOU, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT

08:48.083 --> 08:49.417
IF YOU'D REFRAIN

08:49.458 --> 08:51.959
FROM ANY AND ALL DISCUSSION
OF OUR SEXUAL HISTORY

08:52.000 --> 08:53.458
AS WELL AS ANY FAILURE

08:53.500 --> 08:55.667
I MIGHT HAVE HAD
IN PURSUING YOU ROMANTICALLY.

08:55.709 --> 08:58.000
WHAT HE'S REALLY SAYING--
"FILTER."

09:00.500 --> 09:03.041
TANYA CAN'T
SAFELY CARRY A BABY

09:03.083 --> 09:05.041
LET ALONE DELIVER ONE,
CAN SHE?

09:05.083 --> 09:07.041
WELL, BECAUSE OF
THE CARDIAC ISSUES

09:07.083 --> 09:08.417
THAT ARE SECONDARY
TO DOWN'S,

09:08.458 --> 09:10.417
IT WOULD BE
A HIGH-RISK PREGNANCY.

09:10.458 --> 09:13.166
BUT WITH PROPER MONITORING,
YES, SHE COULD DO IT.

09:13.208 --> 09:15.166
YEAH.

09:15.208 --> 09:18.041
(sighs)
I MEAN, TANYA HAS DOWN'S,

09:18.083 --> 09:20.041
RICKY HAS
SEVERE LEARNING DISABILITIES.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.625
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW HOW
THEY COULD RAISE A CHILD.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.083
WELL, THEY'D NEED YOUR HELP.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.041
AND IF THE BABY HAS
SPECIAL NEEDS, TOO?

09:26.083 --> 09:28.667
WELL, I-IT MAY NOT.
YES, THERE'S A 50% CHANCE

09:28.709 --> 09:31.417
THAT THE BABY COULD BE BORN
WITH DOWN'S AND COULD BE

09:31.458 --> 09:34.041
AT GREATER RISK FOR OTHER KINDS
OF COMPLICATIONS, BUT--

09:34.083 --> 09:35.667
PLEASE, DR. BENNETT.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.000
I APPRECIATE HOW SUPPORTIVE
YOU'RE TRYING TO BE.

09:38.041 --> 09:40.041
I-I LOVE TANYA

09:40.083 --> 09:42.834
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

09:42.875 --> 09:46.125
BUT AFTER I HAD HER,
I COULDN'T HAVE ANOTHER CHILD.

09:46.166 --> 09:49.125
I WANTED TO KEEP HER AT HOME,
RAISE HER MYSELF,

09:49.166 --> 09:52.291
AND IT WAS SO MUCH WORK.

09:52.333 --> 09:55.709
TANYA COULDN'T DO IT,
AND I'M...

09:55.750 --> 09:59.625
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO IT AGAIN.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.834
SO YOU'RE PREPARED...

10:02.875 --> 10:05.208
TO ABORT THE BABY?

10:05.250 --> 10:08.333
I'M NOT SURE
I HAVE ANOTHER OPTION.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.041
WELL, HOW WOULD TANYA FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

10:11.083 --> 10:13.875
ERIN HAS POWER OF ATTORNEY
FOR TANYA,

10:13.917 --> 10:16.041
SO IT WOULD BE HER DECISION.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.792
OKAY, WELL, AT THIS POINT,
IT'S--IT'S A PROCEDURE.

10:18.834 --> 10:21.166
IT'S NOT A PILL.
SO WHAT WOULD YOU TELL TANYA?

10:21.208 --> 10:24.041
WELL, I WOULDN'T WANT
TO LIE TO HER.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.291
BUT...

10:25.333 --> 10:27.041
(groans)

10:27.083 --> 10:30.041
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE SOME TIME
TO REALLY THINK THIS OVER?

10:30.083 --> 10:32.041
AND, UH, IN THE INTERIM,
WE CAN DO C.V.S.

10:32.083 --> 10:34.083
GENETIC SCREENING?

10:34.125 --> 10:36.500
IF YOU ARE SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS ABORTION,

10:36.542 --> 10:38.792
TANYA IS ALREADY 11 WEEKS.

10:38.834 --> 10:40.959
A COUPLE MORE DAYS,
IT BECOMES A BIGGER PROCEDURE.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.667
BUT IF WE DO THE C.V.S.,
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO KNOW

10:43.709 --> 10:45.542
WHETHER OR NOT THE BABY
HAS DOWN'S

10:45.583 --> 10:48.375
OR ANY OTHER ABNORMALITIES
OR IF THE BABY IS FINE.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.542
WELL, THEN...

10:52.583 --> 10:54.583
(sighs) LET'S--
LET'S DO THE TEST.

10:54.625 --> 10:56.750
GREAT.

11:02.208 --> 11:04.166
YOU KNOW
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND?

11:04.208 --> 11:06.750
WHY CAN'T PEOPLE
JUST BE HAPPY FOR ME?

11:06.792 --> 11:09.041
I WROTE A BOOK.
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

11:09.083 --> 11:12.333
WHEN SAM PUBLISHED A BOOK,
WE THREW HIM A DAMN PARTY.

11:12.375 --> 11:15.959
WHY AREN'T YOU
LOOKING UP AT ME?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.917
OH, NOT YOU, TOO.

11:17.959 --> 11:20.000
"MAN-CHILD"?

11:22.667 --> 11:25.041
OKAY. UH, YES.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.333
I DID CALL YOU THAT ONCE.

11:27.375 --> 11:29.083
MAYBE TWICE.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.375
BUT--BUT THAT ISN'T
ALL THAT I SAID ABOUT YOU.

11:31.417 --> 11:33.875
I-I-I REPEATEDLY REFER TO YOU
AS MY BEST FRIEND.

11:33.917 --> 11:35.625
MAN... CHILD.

11:35.667 --> 11:38.667
OH, COME ON, COOP.
I NEED SOMEONE ON MY SIDE.

11:38.709 --> 11:40.166
MAN-CHILD!

11:42.208 --> 11:44.166
YOU GUILTED ERIN
INTO TAKING THAT TEST.

11:44.208 --> 11:46.166
NO, I AM JUST TRYING
TO MAKE SURE

11:46.208 --> 11:47.875
THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS
THE SITUATION

11:47.917 --> 11:50.875
BEFORE SHE MAKES A DECISION
THAT SHE AND TANYA MIGHT REGRET.

11:50.917 --> 11:53.166
YOU JUST DIDN'T WANT HER
TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

11:53.208 --> 11:55.166
NO. NO, I DON'T WANT HER
TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

11:55.208 --> 11:57.166
BUT YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
THAT'S GONNA HAVE TO RAISE

11:57.208 --> 11:58.917
THAT CHILD--HER GRANDCHILD.

11:58.959 --> 12:01.041
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HELP RAISE A GRANDCHILD.

12:01.083 --> 12:03.041
WHAT ARE YOU
HOPING FOR HERE, NAI--

12:03.083 --> 12:06.041
A HEALTHY BABY AND FOR ERIN TO
DECIDE THAT TANYA CAN KEEP IT?

12:06.083 --> 12:08.792
YES.
AND IF THAT BABY HAS DOWN'S,
THEN WHAT?

12:08.834 --> 12:10.709
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA ADVISE
HER TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.917
THE CATHOLIC IN YOU
COULDN'T TOLERATE THE SIN

12:12.959 --> 12:15.458
WHILE THE DOCTOR WOULD WORRY
IT FEELS LIKE EUGENICS.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.458
LOOK, IF ERIN HAS
THE RESPONSIBILITY

12:17.500 --> 12:19.458
OF RAISING TWO CHILDREN
WITH DOWN'S, HOW GOOD

12:19.500 --> 12:22.041
DO YOU THINK THAT'S GONNA BE
FOR TANYA AND THE BABY?

12:22.083 --> 12:24.166
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
WHEN ERIN'S GONE?

12:24.208 --> 12:27.792
THE LONGER THIS GOES ON,
THE MORE AWARE TANYA'S GONNA BE,

12:27.834 --> 12:30.208
AND THE HARDER
IT'S GONNA BE FOR ERIN

12:30.250 --> 12:32.250
TO EXPLAIN TO HER DAUGHTER
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT

12:32.291 --> 12:35.041
TO HAVE ANOTHER BABY
THAT'S LIKE HER.
MAYBE THE BABY
WON'T HAVE DOWN'S.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.041
MAYBE THE BABY
WON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

12:37.083 --> 12:39.291
THAT'S THE HOPE YOU'RE SELLING
HER--OF HAVING THE BABY

12:39.333 --> 12:42.041
SHE DIDN'T GET
THE FIRST TIME AROUND.
I NEVER SAID THAT.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.333
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

12:47.291 --> 12:49.250
SHE DOES SEEM
TO BE DISSOCIATING.

12:49.291 --> 12:51.542
(man) I'VE KNOWN ANDI
FOR FIVE YEARS, DR. WALLACE--

12:51.583 --> 12:53.542
ALMOST AS LONG
AS I'VE KNOWN LARA.

12:53.583 --> 12:57.041
NOT ONCE HAVE I SEEN ANY OF
THESE SO-CALLED PERSONALITIES.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.917
I KNOW THIS DISORDER CAN BE
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND.

12:59.959 --> 13:02.291
DISORDER? IS THAT WHAT WE CALL
IT WHEN MY FUTURE SISTER-IN-LAW

13:02.333 --> 13:05.291
DECIDES TO GO CRAZY CAKES
A WEEK BEFORE WE MOVE?

13:05.333 --> 13:08.500
CALLING HER CRAZY
IS NOT HELPING THE SITUATION.

13:10.375 --> 13:13.166
I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:15.375 --> 13:18.041
SO... (sighs)
WHERE ARE YOU MOVING?

13:18.083 --> 13:19.333
ARIZONA.
JACK GOT PROMOTED.

13:19.375 --> 13:21.333
I'LL BE MANAGING
A NEW PLANT IN PHOENIX.

13:21.375 --> 13:23.333
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO DOWN
THIS WEEKEND

13:23.375 --> 13:26.041
AND LOOK FOR HOUSES.
NO, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO
WITHOUT ME.

13:26.083 --> 13:28.041
I'M GONNA HAVE TO STAY HERE.

13:28.083 --> 13:30.917
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AT DINNER,
BEFORE YOUR SISTER STARTED--
STOP IT.

13:30.959 --> 13:33.041
LOOK...

13:33.083 --> 13:34.875
I'M NOT GOING WITHOUT YOU.

13:34.917 --> 13:37.792
I CAN'T LEAVE ANDI.
I'M SORRY.

13:37.834 --> 13:40.250
(sighs)

13:43.083 --> 13:44.709
THANK YOU.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.417
HEY.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.417
YOU CAN STOP BEING
ALL MOODY MOOSE NOW.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.542
I'M WEARING IT.

13:50.583 --> 13:53.375
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WEAR IT.

13:53.417 --> 13:54.834
YES, YOU DO.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.375
NO, I...

13:56.417 --> 13:58.375
YOU WERE WEARING IT
WHEN HE RAPED YOU.

13:58.417 --> 14:01.417
I WAS ALSO WEARING
MY SKIN THAT DAY.

14:01.458 --> 14:04.375
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
ABOUT IT.

14:04.417 --> 14:06.291
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO WEAR THE RING,

14:06.333 --> 14:07.834
YOU SHOULDN'T WEAR IT.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.834
WHY CAN'T I GET YOU
ANOTHER ONE?

14:09.875 --> 14:11.875
IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY.
IT'S JUST A RING.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.875
IT'S AN ENGAGEMENT RING.
IT SAYS YOU'RE MINE.

14:13.917 --> 14:15.375
IT MAKES IT OFFICIAL.

14:15.417 --> 14:18.041
WE'RE OFFICIAL BECAUSE WE'RE
COMMITTED TO EACH OTHER.

14:18.083 --> 14:20.333
THERE ARE STEPS IN PEOPLE'S
LIVES TOGETHER, CHARLOTTE--

14:20.375 --> 14:22.875
SEX, MOVING IN,
RING, MARRIAGE.

14:22.917 --> 14:24.417
WE'RE ON THE RING.

14:24.458 --> 14:26.375
WHICH I'M WEARING.

14:28.083 --> 14:31.041
"AND THEN THE WOMAN I THOUGHT
WAS MY FRIEND AND CONFIDANT

14:31.083 --> 14:35.041
TOLD A JUDGE I SHOULDN'T BE
GIVEN CUSTODY OF MY OWN CHILD."

14:35.083 --> 14:37.792
(singsongy)
PAGING ADDISON MONTGOMERY.

14:37.834 --> 14:40.333
(normal voice) "IT WAS HARDLY
AN IMPARTIAL OPINION

14:40.375 --> 14:42.041
"SINCE AT THE TIME,

14:42.083 --> 14:44.417
SHE WAS BASICALLY
LIVING WITH MY SON'S FATHER."

14:44.458 --> 14:47.291
OH, MAN. I BETTER HIDE ADDISON'S
COPY OF THIS MANUSCRIPT

14:47.333 --> 14:50.041
BEFORE SHE GETS BACK.
ANYTHING CAN BE MADE
TO SOUND BAD

14:50.083 --> 14:52.041
WHEN IT'S TAKEN
OUT OF CONTEXT.

14:52.083 --> 14:55.041
LIKE THE PART WHERE VIOLET
SAYS SHE RECONSIDERED

14:55.083 --> 14:57.917
ALL OF THE PARENTING ADVICE
YOU GAVE HER

14:57.959 --> 15:01.041
ONCE YOUR 16-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
GOT KNOCKED UP?
SHE DID NOT DRAG MAYA
INTO THIS.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.291
MM-HMM.
YOU KNOW WHAT PART
I THOUGHT WAS A HOOT?

15:03.333 --> 15:06.041
THE SECTION WHERE SHE HINTED
THAT I DON'T KNOW MY FIANCé

15:06.083 --> 15:08.208
AS WELL AS SHE DOES.
THAT'S NO HINT.

15:08.250 --> 15:11.000
SHE DRAGGED MAYA
INTO THIS.

15:15.208 --> 15:18.750
(sighs) DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I DIDN'T WRITE THE DAMN BOOK.

15:18.792 --> 15:21.875
YOU NEED
TO SIT HER DOWN, PETE.
AND SAY WHAT?

15:21.917 --> 15:24.667
THAT SHE NEEDS TO TAKE US
OUT OF THE BOOK.
(Amelia)
TELL HER OWN STORY.

15:24.709 --> 15:27.750
DON'T DRAG THE REST OF US
THROUGH THE MUD.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SHE'S GONNA LISTEN TO ME?

15:27.792 --> 15:29.750
SHE HAS TO,
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

15:29.792 --> 15:33.000
WHO'S STILL TALKING TO HER.

15:41.959 --> 15:44.250
OKAY, WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

15:44.291 --> 15:47.041
THIS FEELS FUNNY.
HANG IN THERE, TANYA.

15:47.083 --> 15:48.709
AND...

15:48.750 --> 15:51.041
WE... ARE DONE.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.041
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
(Sam) RIGHT.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.917
ARE YOU OKAY?

15:54.959 --> 15:59.125
I'M OKAY, MOM. DID YOU GET RID
OF THE DOT WE SAW IN MY BELLY?

15:59.166 --> 16:02.709
UH, THAT'S NOT
WHAT THIS WAS, HONEY.

16:02.750 --> 16:05.041
I DIDN'T LIKE IT.
(knock on door)

16:05.083 --> 16:08.709
I-I-IS TANYA HERE?
I-I'M RICKY.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.166
RICKY!
(Sam) RICKY, COULD YOU
GIVE US JUST A MINUTE?

16:11.208 --> 16:13.041
UH, TANYA'S ALMOST DONE.

16:13.083 --> 16:15.166
NO, COME IN.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.709
A-A-ARE YOU OKAY?
I'M OKAY.

16:17.750 --> 16:22.333
UH, WH-WH-WH-WHAT--
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

16:25.250 --> 16:27.834
WE WERE DOING A TEST.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.709
IT WAS A TEST
ON A BABY.

16:35.750 --> 16:38.750
YOU AND TANYA MADE A BABY,

16:38.792 --> 16:40.917
AND IT'S IN HER BELLY.

16:40.959 --> 16:43.083
WE--WE--WE MADE A BABY!

16:43.125 --> 16:45.583
WE MADE A BABY?!

16:45.625 --> 16:48.917
(laughs)

16:48.959 --> 16:51.625
I REMEMBER ART THERAPY.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.709
MY LAST SHRINK
WAS A BIG FAN.

16:53.750 --> 16:56.375
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY
OF EXPRESSING YOURSELF.

17:04.834 --> 17:07.333
I MET YOUR SISTER'S FIANCé
YESTERDAY.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.792
JACK?
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

17:09.834 --> 17:11.792
SO YOU TWO GET ALONG?

17:11.834 --> 17:14.041
WHY WOULDN'T WE?

17:14.083 --> 17:17.750
HE TOLD ME ABOUT
HIS NEW JOB IN ARIZONA.

17:17.792 --> 17:20.041
ARE YOU PLANNING
ON MOVING THERE WITH THEM?

17:20.083 --> 17:24.000
NO. IT'S JUST GONNA BE
THE TWO OF THEM.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.667
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

17:25.709 --> 17:28.041
SURE.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.667
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE JACK?

17:29.709 --> 17:32.000
(chuckles) YEAH.

17:34.542 --> 17:36.500
YOU'LL BE ALONE
FOR THE FIRST TIME

17:36.542 --> 17:38.250
SINCE YOUR PARENTS DIED.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.834
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

17:40.875 --> 17:43.625
I THINK
I CAN MANAGE WITHOUT...
