01:40.560 --> 01:43.950
I never gave my name.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.030
I have a message
from Pipenko.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.718
I knew you...

01:53.200 --> 01:55.555
I-I knew you were...

01:57.360 --> 01:58.509
Sorry. Hold on.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.992
Gun!
I knew you had rocks!

02:03.120 --> 02:05.315
Dagnabit.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.436
"I knew I'd find you
hiding under a rock."

02:11.520 --> 02:13.909
Well that makes
a lot more sense.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.514

is like a predator fish, right?

03:00.720 --> 03:03.075
So for a lure, I'll use, like,
a bladed spinner bait

03:03.200 --> 03:05.509
or, like, a crank bait
with a rattle in it, you know?

03:05.600 --> 03:07.830
Is that
Harold Trunlow's boat?

03:07.920 --> 03:11.754
That investment banker that embezzled,
like, over $200 million from his clients?

03:21.360 --> 03:23.715
Kaboom!

04:42.080 --> 04:43.832
Anything you want.
Really, anything?

04:43.920 --> 04:45.592
Mm-hmm.

04:45.720 --> 04:49.872
Why did you ask us to film you?
Proof.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.712
Proof?
Proof of what?

04:51.800 --> 04:54.314
All right, I'll start
at the beginning.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.992
Gunther.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.992
Gunther is maybe
the most feared hitman

04:59.080 --> 05:00.911
working in the industry today.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.877
He's a fucking asshole.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.712
You know, it's nothing
personal, right?

05:04.800 --> 05:06.074
It's all business.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.616
You want to be king,
you have to kill the king.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.278
And right now,
Gunther is king.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.799
But very soon,

05:10.880 --> 05:12.950
I will be the guy

05:13.080 --> 05:15.230
who killed Gunther.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.072
And you're gonna
help me prove it.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.355
Why are you
gonna succeed

05:19.440 --> 05:21.351
when so many
others have failed?

05:21.440 --> 05:23.749
'Cause I put together
an unstoppable team.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.353
Oh, I got a key up here.
Oh! That's just spiders.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.955
Anyway, this is
my childhood home.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.871
Hi. I'm Donald Piznowski.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.918
Uh, no one calls me Donald.
Everyone calls me Donnie.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.355
Or Boom-Boom.
I'm trying to get that started.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.910
My first job was working at the Belfax
Coal Mines right down the road.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.877
They assigned me
to dynamite.

05:46.960 --> 05:50.555
There was this one guy, Jim Shumpansky.
He's just a bully.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.756
Just always picking at ya.
"Did you finish your work?

05:52.840 --> 05:54.353
"Did you finish your work,
Donnie?"

05:54.440 --> 05:55.616
And I would say,
"No, I did not, Jim.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.039
Leave me alone.
I'm a grown man."

05:57.120 --> 06:00.078
So one day, tunnel three's
rigged to explode,

06:00.160 --> 06:04.517
and, um...
someone forgot to tell him.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.831
It was me.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.036
I didn't tell him,
so he died in there.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.361
I blew him up. That's when...
That was the day I was like,

06:17.400 --> 06:19.056
"I think I want to blow
people up for a living."

06:19.080 --> 06:21.992
It's a lonely life,
you know, killer for hire.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.152
I think Blake is the closest
thing I have to a best friend.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.216
Would you kill
him if someone paid you to?

06:27.240 --> 06:29.071
Yes, I would kill him.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.920
Sometimes I think about what it would
be like to have, like, a family

06:32.000 --> 06:36.516
and kids and stuff,
but then I go like...

06:36.600 --> 06:38.750
I don't know
if I'd be good at it.

06:41.320 --> 06:45.279
My name is Sanaa
Mastourch Fairouza.

06:45.360 --> 06:48.033
My first professional kill
was at the age of eight.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.872
Why did
you start so young?

06:49.960 --> 06:53.999
I am the only child
of Rahmat Noushzad Fairouza,

06:54.080 --> 06:56.640
one of the world's
most feared assassins.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.910
They call him
"The Nightmare."

06:59.000 --> 07:01.878
People automatically assume
that I benefit

07:01.960 --> 07:06.636
from sharing my father's name,
but I don't feel that that's true.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.115
I just want to be
recognized for my skill.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.152
Killing Gunther's my chance
to make a name for myself

07:12.240 --> 07:15.437
and prove I am more than
just my father's daughter.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.717
Holy shit!

07:18.800 --> 07:20.791
Did you see that shot?!
Huh?!

07:20.880 --> 07:22.598
That's my little girl!

07:22.680 --> 07:25.592
Representing!
Representing!

07:26.680 --> 07:28.113
Gimme some!
Gimme some!

07:30.880 --> 07:32.950
Hi. My name is Gabe Beales.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.996
I run tech ops and intel,

07:35.080 --> 07:37.150
technology operations
and intelligence.

07:37.240 --> 07:40.550
I'm sort of new to
the professional killer game,

07:40.640 --> 07:43.234
just, like, assassins
and killing people,

07:43.320 --> 07:46.676
but there's just way more money
in it than standard hacking,

07:46.760 --> 07:49.672
and I'm fascinated
by the culture.

07:49.760 --> 07:53.594
My nickname is "The Human Computer."

07:53.680 --> 07:55.750
There's no system
I can't crack.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.912
Oh, crap!
That's not good.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.156
I'm kind of like
a Gunther superfan.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.037
I'm obsessed with him.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.599
He's the greatest hitman ever.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.558
Everyone knows who he is,
but no one does.

08:07.640 --> 08:08.914
He's the boogeyman.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.558
I'm just excited
to meet him.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.393
Just, you know,
walk up and shake his hand.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.311
And then,

08:15.400 --> 08:18.198
you know,
watch everyone kill him.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.714
And then there's
our secret weapon.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.234
Ashley.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.708
I'm Ashley.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.831
Ashley is my mentor,
sort of father figure.

08:32.919 --> 08:35.480
Took me under his wing,
guided me, trained me.

08:35.559 --> 08:38.198
Made me the man
I am today.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.416
He taught me everything
he knows about the killing game,

08:40.440 --> 08:43.830
which is a lot, because he's
been at it for a very, very,

08:43.960 --> 08:46.110
very long time.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.237
But the old man's just as deadly as ever.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.275
Go home to your family, child.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.989
With Ashley onboard,
there's no way we can fail.

09:01.880 --> 09:05.919
That Gunther,
he double-crossed me.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.516
I swear,
if I ever see him...

09:10.600 --> 09:12.875
if I ever see him again...

09:15.640 --> 09:18.996
So, Ashley has had
a heart attack.

09:19.120 --> 09:22.635
The doctors say that he will...

09:22.720 --> 09:24.358
he will be okay,

09:24.440 --> 09:27.637
but that he needs to be off of
his feet for at least a month.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.870
Hey, Gabe.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.951
Kind of trying
to talk here, bud.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.776
Now that you've
lost your secret weapon... Sorry.

09:33.800 --> 09:34.994
are you gonna call it off?
No.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.788
No, we're fine.
We're just going to need...

09:40.920 --> 09:43.480
Gabe, Gabe, come away from the
water fountain. Come away.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.511
Come back here.
Read a magazine.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.670
Sorry. I'm not mad
at you, okay?

09:47.760 --> 09:50.752
I just...
It's okay.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.400
We're gonna need to find
a little more help.

09:53.480 --> 09:56.711
We reached out to all the,
uh, hitmen, contract killers

09:56.800 --> 09:58.552
that we knew
and trusted.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.709
Got a lot of noes.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.472
Almost all noes.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.709
But a few bites,

10:02.800 --> 10:05.598
and they're pretty raw, but...

10:05.680 --> 10:07.360
They're all loose cannons.
They're maniacs.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.198
They're descent-ish, and we
need all the help we can get.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.793
They're average.
Who's coming first?

10:11.960 --> 10:15.111
Izzat.
"Crusher"? Nice!

10:16.840 --> 10:18.751
Izzat Bukhari
is a former extremist

10:18.840 --> 10:20.956
who's gone into business
for himself.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.996
He's still building
his portfolio as a hitman,

10:23.080 --> 10:25.036
so he agreed to
a secret meeting with us.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.953
Normally, you want to meet in
a discreet place like this, so...

10:28.040 --> 10:29.976
Who the fuck is this, Blake?!

10:30.000 --> 10:32.096
- Why is there a goddamn camera on me?!
- Put the camera down!

10:32.120 --> 10:35.317
Blake, you got two seconds to explain
this shit! Okay! Put the camera down!

10:35.400 --> 10:37.496
- Sorry, they're with us.
- What do you mean, "They're with us"?

10:37.520 --> 10:39.033
I mean that's our crew.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.714
Why the fuck do we
have a camera crew?

10:41.800 --> 10:44.155
I did not explain that, and
that is completely my fault.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.514
I apologize.
Damn it!

10:45.600 --> 10:47.909
Crusher!
All right.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.632
Name's Iz.
Izzat.

10:49.720 --> 10:53.190
People call me Crusher
'cause of this.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.872
I crush things.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.632
I just don't really
like that name.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.349
Sort of reminds me of the frat
guys I went to school with.

11:00.440 --> 11:03.193
I lost the arm, uh,
in a suicide, um, bomb.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.999
Not my suicide bomb,
someone else's suicide bomb.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.798
I was helping him
put it on,

11:07.880 --> 11:12.510
and he was fidgeting, and, uh...
yada, yada, yada.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.194
I would lose an arm for that.
So cool.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.236
Oh, man.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.430
Yeah, it clenches when
I run out of battery.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.988
Either of you have a Android
or a LG charger or something?

11:22.080 --> 11:24.310
Um... I have
an 6S charger.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.994
Yeah, no, it's not
Apple-compatible.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.998
We've also set
a meeting with Pak Yong Qi,

11:30.080 --> 11:32.469
who is a unique
kind of killer.

11:32.560 --> 11:35.154
But I knew Yong would be
excited to join up,

11:35.240 --> 11:37.356
because he has a personal
beef with Gunther.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.034
It's Blake! It's Blake!
They're with us! It's okay.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.519
I almost threw this
in your face.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.510
I'm glad
you did not.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.999
This is acid.
Yeah.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.520
You would've...
It'd a-been a bummer.

11:45.560 --> 11:50.156
Gunther killed my best friend,
Mr. Slick.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.832
And I will have
my revenge.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.456
Your best friend
was also a hitman?

11:53.480 --> 11:56.278
He was a snake.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.391
Oh, like a con man?

11:58.480 --> 12:00.550
No. A literal snake.

12:00.640 --> 12:04.553
My pet snake. The only
thing I ever truly loved.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.791
Gunther found out I used
Mr. Slick to make my poisons,

12:07.880 --> 12:09.518
so he executed him.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.113
I'm sorry.
Your poisons?

12:11.200 --> 12:14.033
I only kill with poison.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.395
You see, it's more elegant,

12:16.480 --> 12:17.959
sophisticated.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.957
And I don't use guns.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.840
The sight of blood
makes me violently ill.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.069
Really?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.879
I can't
even say the word...

12:26.960 --> 12:29.428
You don't have to say it. Don't...

12:29.560 --> 12:31.596
- Stop trying to say it!
- No way!

12:31.680 --> 12:33.456
Absolutely not! If they
are in, man, I am out!

12:33.480 --> 12:35.216
Then you're out.
They're already flying here.

12:35.240 --> 12:37.071
Fine. Who?
Who's flying here?

12:37.160 --> 12:39.515
The friggin'
Bellakalakova twins!

12:39.600 --> 12:42.194
Oh, crap.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.352
I've never heard
of 'em.

12:45.440 --> 12:48.318
Brother and sister
out of southern Russia.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.834
Remember
the Porsinka Blaze?

12:50.920 --> 12:53.070
No.
Stadium fire.

12:53.160 --> 12:56.357
Fourteen thousand
people burned alive.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.271
That was them.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.191
They're monsters.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.872
It's just a meeting.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.155
Well, I'm gonna
go with you, then. Fine.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.878
You better do it
in a public place.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.758
I mean, I'm a maniac,
but those guys are psychopaths.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.839
Why is
this so good?!

13:17.560 --> 13:19.596
Freeze frame.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.352
I am Mia,
and this is Barold.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.158
What's up?
What's up?

13:23.280 --> 13:26.272
And we have never been
to United States before,

13:26.360 --> 13:27.679
but we
love it here.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.752
We love it. We want to see
New York, apple pie,

13:30.840 --> 13:32.717
Hollywood stars...

13:32.800 --> 13:35.519
Barold. Barold!
All right!

13:35.600 --> 13:40.151
Coming to visit, we
are treating like a workcation.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.869
Workcation when we go...
We kill...

13:43.960 --> 13:45.188
somewhere else...

13:45.280 --> 13:46.315
somewhere else
and kill.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.311
and then kill.
And kill there.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.039
Workcation.
Workcation.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.110
Okay, guys,
we got some snacks,

13:56.200 --> 13:57.997
some healthy ones,
some not so healthy.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.560
Donnie brought Ho-Hos.
You're welcome.

13:59.640 --> 14:01.256
So you have him to thank.
I just want to say

14:01.280 --> 14:04.158
how much I appreciate everyone
rallying behind this project.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.919
We're about to do
something incredible.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.638
We're about
to change the game.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.438
They say there's no
honor among thieves,

14:10.520 --> 14:12.351
but clearly there's
a lot among hitmen.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.079
And, uh, I'm very
proud to say that.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.236
Is there
an outlet?

14:17.320 --> 14:19.550
I was literally right in
the middle of a speech.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.756
I have no idea.
If I had to guess,

14:21.880 --> 14:24.136
I'd say that big one right there
where all the electrical stuff are.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.200
- Oh, that one?
- Blake?

14:25.280 --> 14:27.430
Yes, Yong?
Do we have a plan?

14:27.520 --> 14:28.999
Uh, a wonderful
question.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.976
I was just getting to that
before I was interrupted.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.629
We do have a plan. Our plan is
we're going to put out a fake hit.

14:34.720 --> 14:35.869
We're gonna lure
Gunther out.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.416
- We're gonna be waiting for him.
- No.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.078
Gunther will smell a trap.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.869
What we need to do is
figure out where he lives.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.154
Fuck, yeah,
what she said.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.515
I take a picture.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.830
It is a great point,
but I assure you,

14:48.920 --> 14:50.816
the hit will look authentic.
you're embarrassing me.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.056
- Gabe is working on it...
- No!

14:52.080 --> 14:55.117
Hey, no, this doesn't
have any power.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.416
What do you want me to do about it, Gabe?
Figure it out.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.016
That's your department.
Please stop interrupting.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.837
When is visit Hollywood?

15:00.960 --> 15:03.190
You promised me
picture of Scott Wolf house.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.640
He want see
Scott Wolf house, or...

15:04.680 --> 15:05.976
We talked about
this, didn't we?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.831
Kill Gunther first,
then visit Scott Wolf.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.638
That was always the deal.
What, Gabe?!

15:09.760 --> 15:12.115
I'm gonna have to go get a
portable source from my van.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.176
You don't need my permission.
You're a grown man.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.838
Whoa!

15:15.920 --> 15:18.115
We got an arm
power-down, guys.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.680
- And we got glass. Okay! That did it.
- Oopsie. Bloody finger.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.116
- What just happened?
- Blood.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.519
Because of the blood?

15:25.600 --> 15:27.376
You're like a baby!
That is disgusting!

15:34.320 --> 15:35.639
I surrender.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.679
It's Max!
It's Max!

15:41.760 --> 15:44.513
So, this is awesome. I
didn't expect him to be here,

15:44.600 --> 15:47.160
but Max and I used to be
partners back in the day.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.515
We were a two-man duo. Uh-oh!
Blakey.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.751
Here comes trouble!
Here comes trouble!

15:52.840 --> 15:55.308
What are you doing here, man?
I heard about Ashley.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.356
Yeah, yeah.
Ashley trained both of us.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.351
You're going to be dead in a week.
Yeah, right.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.256
Yeah, you're here to steal our glory.
That's what you're doing.

16:01.280 --> 16:04.317
Glory? Is that what you're
calling it, your virginity? No!

16:04.440 --> 16:06.237
You're calling virginity Glory?
Hello, Glory!

16:06.360 --> 16:08.157
You would want it.
You would want it.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.798
I don't want it.
Yeah, you would.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.760
It's good to see you, man.
It's good to see you.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.496
Listen up. You're all
at a big disadvantage,

16:13.520 --> 16:16.512
because none of you
know who Gunther is.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.636
Therefore, how are
you gonna find him?

16:18.720 --> 16:21.075
You can't find him.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.355
Till now.

16:23.440 --> 16:27.513
I'd heard rumors that Gunther has
a safe house in the Balkans.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.398
I got an old buddy of mine
who's a dropper out there.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.630
Sieppa Abachi,
just a fantastic guy.

16:32.760 --> 16:33.829
He makes
a mean cevapi.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.148
It's pork, it's beef,

16:35.240 --> 16:36.878
bunch of spices,
delicious.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.394
Anyway, I said,
"Look into it."

16:39.480 --> 16:42.040
Turns out, our friend
Gunther lives...

16:45.080 --> 16:47.150
Oh, my God!

16:47.240 --> 16:49.595
Get down!

16:52.560 --> 16:54.232
Where's it coming from?

16:56.920 --> 16:58.797
He's on the roof!

17:02.400 --> 17:04.435
Cover me!

17:05.280 --> 17:07.589
Did it get there?

17:08.599 --> 17:10.271
Incoming!

17:12.119 --> 17:15.351
...camera on. Turn it on, and leave
it on, and never turn it off!

17:15.440 --> 17:16.736
We were almost killed!

17:16.760 --> 17:18.478
I don't care.
You're here to film.

17:18.560 --> 17:19.959
We are just
here to observe.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.758
You said we'd be safe.
We're done.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.115
You are done when the job is done.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.713
That's what you
agreed to.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.315
And if you ever stop recording again,
I will kill you.

17:29.440 --> 17:33.911
Do you understand?
Never stop recording.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.719
When did you
actually stop?

17:36.800 --> 17:38.995
When the rocket
was coming.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.991
Show me
that footage.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.678
Clear!

17:44.920 --> 17:47.275
Yeah, he's gone.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.358
Okay, and
there's the playback.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.192
He's on the roof!

17:53.960 --> 17:55.678
There.
Stop there.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.950
We got him.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.634
I give you Gunther.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.638
Enhance image.
What?

18:04.720 --> 18:08.076
Enhance that image.
I can't do that.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.513
Why not?

18:09.600 --> 18:10.640
Because that's
not a thing.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.438
That's not how
technology works.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.829
Yes, it is. I've seen it a bunch.
That's exactly how.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.718
Minority Report. Person of lnterest.
I don't know. I'm with Gabe.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.313
Not in real life.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.136
Keep the sharpness
of when it's small,

18:21.160 --> 18:22.680
and bring it like
they do all the time.

18:22.720 --> 18:25.029
That's technologically
impossible.

18:25.120 --> 18:27.509
What about this?
Can you get the data off of this?

18:27.600 --> 18:31.195
I can try, but
it looks pretty busted.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.191
You look
pretty busted.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.874
Damn it!

18:37.040 --> 18:39.349
He's really mad.

18:39.440 --> 18:44.230
Okay, all right. Gabe, come on.
It's not Zelda.

18:46.760 --> 18:47.875
It was him.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.677
It had to be him.

18:50.760 --> 18:53.911
I don't know how, but Gunther
knows we're after him.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.831
Are you scared?

18:55.920 --> 18:57.751
No.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.478
No, now it's personal.

18:59.560 --> 19:03.269
Wasn't it already
a little bit personal?

19:03.360 --> 19:05.191
How do you mean?

19:05.280 --> 19:08.477
Isn't part of this
about... Lisa?

19:09.720 --> 19:11.358
About who?

19:11.440 --> 19:13.351
Lisa McCalla.

19:13.440 --> 19:14.873
She's your ex, right?

19:14.960 --> 19:16.632
No, I, um...

19:16.720 --> 19:17.948
I don't... Uh...

19:18.040 --> 19:19.155
A Lisa? I don't...

19:19.240 --> 19:21.834
I don't...

19:21.920 --> 19:23.876
No, I don't know her.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.193
What was the name?

19:26.280 --> 19:28.953
My name
is Lisa McCalla.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.871
I am
a retired hitwoman.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.679
Blake and I were
together for four years.

19:33.760 --> 19:37.309
How did it end?
Not well. Um...

19:37.400 --> 19:39.868
I had been unhappy
for a while,

19:39.960 --> 19:44.272
and, um... I ended up leaving
him for somebody else.

19:44.360 --> 19:46.396
Anybody in particular?

19:46.520 --> 19:48.670
Well, I didn't know
this at the time,

19:48.760 --> 19:52.753
but later found out that
the gentleman I was with

19:52.840 --> 19:54.592
is the man
known as Gunther.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.989
So his real name
is not Gunther.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.354
No.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.919
What is
his real name?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.399
Nice try.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.160
Where did you
get this information?

20:03.240 --> 20:05.336
'Cause I've never heard of this
woman before in my life,

20:05.360 --> 20:08.158
so you got some
misinformation, my friend.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.834
I have the last
message that Blake left me.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.512
Would you like to hear it?
Yes.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.600
Sure.

20:15.240 --> 20:18.118
Lisa, please pick up.

20:18.200 --> 20:21.272
Please pick up
the phone, Lisa.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.510
Please...

20:23.600 --> 20:26.672
- That doesn't sound like me.
- Don't leave me!

20:26.760 --> 20:30.435
Does that sound like me to you?
I, Blake, love you!

20:30.520 --> 20:32.256
We have the same name,
but that doesn't mean anything.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.838
I need you!

20:33.960 --> 20:35.200
It's not even
the same register.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.949
I want you to be
Mrs. Blake Hammon!

20:39.040 --> 20:40.216
Okay, I don't remember
that part.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.470
I want to die!

20:46.160 --> 20:47.559
You've seen her recently?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.070
How is she?

20:51.160 --> 20:53.116
Life is good. Yeah.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.679
Um...

20:54.760 --> 20:57.672
I'm not killing people anymore,
so I sleep better.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.990
I started my own business,

21:00.080 --> 21:01.195
Hey Claydies.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.630
We do erotic
ceramics parties.

21:04.720 --> 21:07.359
Mostly bachelorettes, um,
girls' night out.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.715
...inner sexuality
connecting to the clay.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.109
I had this realization,
like, "Here I am

21:12.200 --> 21:16.671
ending people's lives, and I'm
not even enjoying my own."

21:16.760 --> 21:19.194
Does this remind
you of your fiancé?

21:19.280 --> 21:20.952
I wish.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.634
Let's be honest.
I'm settling.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.830
Oh.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.592
Why did you decide
to leave Blake?

21:27.720 --> 21:31.349
Oh, well, I-I couldn't
compete with his ambition.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.317
How do you mean?

21:33.400 --> 21:36.198
Well, when Blake and I
first started,

21:36.280 --> 21:39.317
he was... very romantic.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.635
We used to write these
letters back and forth.

21:41.720 --> 21:45.599
And sometimes he would send
pictures from wherever he was.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.513
After a while, I'd write to
him, but I wouldn't hear back.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.517
And I asked him to take some
time off of work

21:50.600 --> 21:53.160
so we could travel and
spend some time together,

21:53.240 --> 21:55.913
but he couldn't
say no to a job.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.395
Blake loves his work.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.675
And I respect that, but...

22:02.280 --> 22:03.793
I wanted him
to love me more.

22:03.880 --> 22:06.314
And Gunther did?
No, that was a mistake.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.595
I want that to be clear.
We're not together anymore,

22:08.720 --> 22:13.032
and I don't want any part of...
what's going on.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.714
Do you still love Blake?

22:18.560 --> 22:21.028
I think a part of me
always will,

22:21.120 --> 22:24.157
but we need
different things.

22:24.240 --> 22:27.391
And I just want him
to be happy.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.392
If killing Gunther brings him
happiness, well...

22:30.480 --> 22:32.596
you know,
good luck to him.

22:39.080 --> 22:42.038
So great news.
Ashley's getting out of the hospital.

22:42.120 --> 22:45.317
Classic Ashley.
You can't keep a good man down.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.152
Gabe, you barely
know him.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.629
Yeah, that's true, but...

22:49.760 --> 22:51.159
You look great!

22:51.240 --> 22:53.708
I just needed a tune-up.
Yeah.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.155
Hey, you gave us a scare,
old-timer.

22:56.240 --> 22:59.516
Who the fuck is he?
It's just Gabe. He drove us.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.830
It's just Gabe.
But you're feeling good, right?

23:01.920 --> 23:04.229
I'm all right, baby doll.
All right.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.430
That Gunther
got to go.

23:06.520 --> 23:09.080
That Gunther
got to be put down.

23:09.160 --> 23:11.435
Yeah.
Ashley? Ashley!

23:11.520 --> 23:14.273
Ashley is back
in the hospital.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.793
Uh, fooled us all.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.394
And the doctors say
he's definitely gonna be

23:18.480 --> 23:20.436
out of commission
for a while now.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.112
So, what now?

23:22.200 --> 23:24.077
Well... needless to say,

23:24.160 --> 23:26.515
it's been a bit
of a rocky start,

23:26.600 --> 23:29.512
but we're gonna go ahead and move
forward with our initial plan,

23:29.600 --> 23:33.479
and we're gonna use a fake
hit to draw Gunther out.

23:33.560 --> 23:36.393
Our fake target
is Schneider Feizmark.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.631
Black-market arms dealer,
one of the biggest in the world.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.837
Feizmark's base of operations
in the U.S. is Miami.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.558
Does Feizmark
know you're doing this?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.551
No, but he has
a lot of enemies,

23:46.640 --> 23:50.155
so it's realistic that someone would
put out a six-figure hit on him.

23:50.280 --> 23:53.875
We're posing as a sheik that
Feizmark screwed over, so...

23:53.960 --> 23:55.393
Do not film him.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.631
Do not film him, please.
Thank you.

23:58.760 --> 23:59.988
You're good.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.548
That was
our travel agent.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.198
Vamos a Miami!

24:15.920 --> 24:18.559
Welcome to Miami.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.278
You guys get in all right?

24:20.360 --> 24:22.157
Uh, the others should be
landing shortly.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.872
What's up, guys?

24:37.920 --> 24:39.273
He refused to change.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.749
I'm wearing the beard.
It's my disguise.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.070
She's just pissed, because
she wouldn't hold my hand.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.559
We're supposed
to be married, okay?

24:45.640 --> 24:47.456
In what world are
we supposed to be married?

24:47.480 --> 24:49.835
We just happened to be
on the same flight,

24:49.920 --> 24:51.656
and he made people move
so he could sit next to me.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.272
'Cause I need
to protect my wife.

24:54.880 --> 24:56.393
You will take
us now?

24:56.480 --> 24:58.789
We see Mickey Mouse
and his world.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.136
You mean Disney World?

25:00.160 --> 25:01.354
Oh, we're in Miami.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.953
That's in Orlando.
Is different?

25:03.040 --> 25:04.268
Yeah, it's
a different city

25:04.360 --> 25:05.816
different part of the state, even.
No.

25:05.840 --> 25:08.195
Far?
A four-hour drive, or so.

25:08.280 --> 25:11.352
Oh, Jesus.

25:12.440 --> 25:15.273
You did this.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.315
Oh, hey.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.517
Hey! Hey, guys, hey.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.114
It's Gabe.
Like my disguise?

25:30.200 --> 25:31.918
The point
was to blend in.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.312
Oh. I thought the point
was to be unrecognizable.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.630
No, that was never the point.
Oh.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.711
Could we stop
at a drugstore?

25:40.800 --> 25:42.995
I forgot to pack
makeup remover.

25:43.080 --> 25:46.152
Why don't you take
care of that yourself?

25:46.240 --> 25:47.719
Okay. You just meet
us at the hotel.

25:47.800 --> 25:51.076
The hotel. Okay.
All right, cool.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.912
See ya, Blake.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.759
Gunther confirmed
the job,

25:57.880 --> 26:01.395
so we start surveillance
first thing in the morning.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.516
All right, boys,
he's open.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.192
It's time
to go shopping.

26:05.280 --> 26:08.078
Regulators!

26:08.160 --> 26:09.513
What?

26:09.600 --> 26:11.556
Let's go.
Yeah, let's go.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.316
What up... bitches?

26:27.400 --> 26:29.630
You Cheyenne?

26:30.640 --> 26:31.993
No.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.798
I'm Mickey fuckin' Mouse.

26:33.880 --> 26:36.599
- Hey.
- You are not Mickey Mouse, motherfucker.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.470
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
I was just fucking with you.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.790
I'm Cheyenne.
Hey, come on in.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.353
Oh, thanks.
Come on in.

26:44.440 --> 26:46.376
Sorry about him.
Hey, welcome aboard. Hey.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.674
That's, uh...

26:47.760 --> 26:49.637
I'm really sorry
about the Mickey.

26:49.720 --> 26:52.234
Don't be shy.
Take a look around.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.469
Welcome to my
world of

26:53.560 --> 26:56.472
♪ Pure ammunition ♪

26:56.560 --> 26:59.552
Willy Wonka.
I love that shit.

26:59.640 --> 27:01.437
Cool.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.875
Caldwell said your
stuff was clean?

27:04.920 --> 27:06.717
Got no complaints.
Oh, boy.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.392
He's laughing...

27:08.520 --> 27:10.416
Seriously, I can file the serial
numbers off whatever you want.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.078
That's fantastic.
I got you, baby!

27:12.160 --> 27:14.799
Okay, great. Yeah, all right.
This is the guy.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.633
Go on!
Shop till you drop.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.790
Anyone want
a latte?

27:19.880 --> 27:21.552
I'm good.
No?

27:29.680 --> 27:30.976
You're not
shopping either?

27:31.000 --> 27:33.116
Oh, yeah. I just
ran out of juice.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.350
I fucked up
this Beretta.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.351
Which actually sucks,
'cause he's got

27:37.440 --> 27:38.536
a "You break it,
you buy it" policy.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.312
'Member? 'Member?
Yes.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.550
He was like, "Hey, motherfucker."
Don't...

27:44.440 --> 27:46.616
Don't do that, though.
Oh, fuck. I need to find a window.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.016
- You're not shopping?
- No.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.508
They don't have any
tiny glass bottles here.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.795
Yeah, well,
it's a gun store.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.075
With the right ingredients,

27:55.160 --> 27:58.675
even a tiny glass bottle can
be the deadliest of weapons.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.752
Yeah, I wanted to ask you
about the whole poison thing.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.990
It feels really
impractical, right?

28:04.080 --> 28:07.436
'Cause you got to get right
up next to the person...

28:10.600 --> 28:12.318
Touché.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.118
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

28:14.200 --> 28:17.158
If I'm in the way, you
can just push me, or...

28:17.240 --> 28:18.514
You're fine.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.272
My therapist
would disagree.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.353
Um, you need
a hand with that?

28:23.440 --> 28:25.635
No.
Mm-hmm.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.271
She is very pretty.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.517
Gabe, ladies
and gentlemen.

28:33.760 --> 28:35.671
Ah! I like this.

28:35.760 --> 28:39.070
Guy hands
me a fat stack.

28:39.160 --> 28:45.679
- USA. USA. USA!
- USA! USA! USA!

28:45.760 --> 28:47.352
Can we not?
Can we not?

28:47.440 --> 28:51.149
Why you so grumpy?
Here, on the house.

28:51.240 --> 28:53.800
Oh, thank you.
No problemo.

28:53.880 --> 28:55.313
You know, we got
to hang sometime.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.595
Yeah, I can't promise anything.
Hmm.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.193
Hate the game,
right?

28:59.280 --> 29:01.475
Yeah, well, good luck.
I hope you do what you gotta do.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.152
You know, it was rad
meeting you guys.

29:03.240 --> 29:05.276
And if you ever,
ever want to find...

29:05.760 --> 29:10.117
All right, all right, all right!
That's what I'm talking about.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.509
I want everyone
to get a lot of rest tonight,

29:12.600 --> 29:15.876
um, 'cause tomorrow's
kind of a big day for me.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.952
I know, tomorrow we're doing what?
Yes, Izzat.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.674
- We're killing Gunther?
- Yeah, we are!

29:21.760 --> 29:23.079
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Good time!

29:23.160 --> 29:25.515
Oh, I have to kill Gunther
tomorrow. Hi, Mom!

29:25.600 --> 29:27.591
We're gonna kill you,
Gunther!

29:27.680 --> 29:29.750
Kill that motherfucker.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.717
We're coming
for you, Gunther.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.639
So we set
up surveillance.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.438
We're going to
shadow Feizmark,

29:38.520 --> 29:40.431
wait for Gunther to make his move.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.720
How long do you
think we 'll have to wait?

29:42.840 --> 29:46.594
It could take anywhere from 24,
72 hours to carry out a hit.

29:46.720 --> 29:49.678
So... we got to be
on our toes.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.395
I'll play.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.797
I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.

30:06.360 --> 30:08.669
Whoa. Whoa!

30:08.760 --> 30:12.833
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys, look.

30:13.840 --> 30:16.229
What is that?
Is that us?

30:17.520 --> 30:19.238
No, it's not
the connection here.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.914
Guys, there's somebody
in the building. Who is that?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.592
Guys, I need a report.

30:23.680 --> 30:25.910
- I'm on it.
- Nobody on our side.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.390
That's him.
That's him. He's here.

30:32.240 --> 30:35.198
All farmers,
the fox is in the henhouse.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.874
I repeat, the fox
is in the henhouse.

30:37.960 --> 30:38.976
Just say he's here.
He's here.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.194
Copy that.

30:40.280 --> 30:41.920
Donnie and I are heading
to the lobby now.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.235
Sanaa, Izzat,
meet us there.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.717
Excuse me.
You can't film in here.

30:48.800 --> 30:52.031
I'm gonna need you to leave the
building immediately, please.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.912
Ow, my keys!
Yong is on the roof.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.136
Mia and Barold are on the floor.
Seen him?

30:55.160 --> 30:57.071
He did.
Sort of.

30:57.160 --> 30:59.336
- You guys take the stairs. We'll meet you up there.
- Got it.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.256
- What do you mean, "sort of"?
- The place is crawling with people with guns.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.456
There's all sorts of people
leaving without signing out!

31:04.480 --> 31:06.216
You and I will take point
at Feizmark's office.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.992
Mia and Barold,
sweep the north side.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.355
Sanaa and Izzat,
cover all emergency exits.

31:10.440 --> 31:12.376
Gabe, get ready to shut down
the elevators on my mark.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.056
Shutting down on your cue.
This is it, man. We're gonna do it.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.832
Here. All right,
say, "Cheese."

31:16.920 --> 31:19.593
Duck face?
Yeah, fine.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.033
Let's go.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.758
We're coming,
Gunther.

31:35.120 --> 31:38.510
Have you seen him?
We might already be too late.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.429
Mr. Feizmark, we are
not here to hurt you.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.590
Where is the man
who was just here?

31:50.720 --> 31:51.869
Help...

31:51.960 --> 31:54.155
He's in the ceiling!

32:06.280 --> 32:08.919
Sanaa, he's headed
towards you, southeast corner.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.309
Roger.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.830
Sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

32:18.920 --> 32:21.639
You okay?
Your hands are very soft.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.913
Barold, it's so loud
in my eye!

32:57.200 --> 32:58.952
Are you okay?
Just get him!

33:07.080 --> 33:08.149
You...

33:14.440 --> 33:17.238
I've seen his face!

33:38.040 --> 33:40.315
No, no,
no, please!

33:45.840 --> 33:47.159
Izzat!

33:47.240 --> 33:49.800
Izzat!
Where is he?! Where is he?!

33:49.920 --> 33:51.831
Did he run past you?

33:53.160 --> 33:55.799
No. No,
no, no, no!

33:55.880 --> 33:58.235
Oh, man,
look at his face!

33:58.360 --> 33:59.475
He's dead.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.949
Where is Gunther?
Where is Gunther!

34:02.040 --> 34:03.758
He can't just disappear!

34:05.640 --> 34:07.517
We should leave.

34:07.600 --> 34:08.600
Oh, man.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.237
Should we take
the arm?

34:10.320 --> 34:12.840
Abort! Everyone
meet at the rendezvous point.

34:17.360 --> 34:19.078
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.433
Where is Izzat?
He's dead.

34:22.520 --> 34:25.512
Why is the van
not waiting? Gabe!

34:28.679 --> 34:30.237
Wait. Where
are the others?

34:30.320 --> 34:32.056
Wait. Where's Sanaa?
We can't leave without Sanaa.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.274
Izzat's dead.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.277
What?
What!

34:35.400 --> 34:37.072
No!
He's dead?!

34:37.159 --> 34:39.958
Oh, God, no!
Someone's coming.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.110
Oh, no!

34:42.199 --> 34:44.270
- Hurry. Get in.
- Where did you go?

34:44.400 --> 34:45.760
I wiped
the security tapes.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.273
Okay, Gabe, go. Go.
Drive. Drive.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.994
Stop crying, and drive.
Stop crying, Gabe.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.114
I shot him.

34:52.199 --> 34:54.315
Who?
Gunther.

34:54.440 --> 34:58.035
You're sure?
Oh, I'm positive.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.896
Okay, great. Great. That's great.
Way to go, Sanaa.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.592
All right, yeah,
that's a good thing.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.856
We'll watch the footage when
we get back to the safe house,

35:03.880 --> 35:07.998
but that is a good thing.
That's a very good thing.

35:08.080 --> 35:10.435
- Oh, God!
- Gabe!

35:15.000 --> 35:18.037
I'll be honest, I'm a little...
Is there any more...?

35:18.120 --> 35:19.520
Oh, I'm still rolling.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.431
Your middle name is Ramis?
Yes. Barold Ramis.

35:22.520 --> 35:23.976
His middle name is Ramis.
Hey, guys, guys.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.673
Quiet, quiet. Here it is.
That's insane.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.596
She's got him. You got him.
She did it.

35:30.680 --> 35:31.976
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa what?

35:32.000 --> 35:34.036
Yep, I see, too.

35:34.120 --> 35:35.120
Gabe, can you go back?

35:35.200 --> 35:38.749
- Looking.
- Going back.

35:38.840 --> 35:41.354
- There. Did you see it?
- I didn't see anything.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.471
Rewind it again,
but play it slow.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.630
- In slow motion.
- In slo-mo. Here it is.

35:45.720 --> 35:48.871
Hold on. Hold on.
Pause there!

35:51.800 --> 35:53.313
Holy shit.
That's you face.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.356
Blake, he's got your face.
He's using your face.

35:55.480 --> 35:58.313
That's not me face.
That looks nothing like me.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.755
No, that's not me.

36:00.840 --> 36:01.955
That face
is that face.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.712
Exactly like you.
It's not!

36:03.800 --> 36:07.190
It's got thin lips. It's got
a very round, small chin.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.872
It wasn't me.
We know!

36:08.960 --> 36:11.235
We know
it wasn't you, okay?

36:11.320 --> 36:12.878
Obviously, Gunther
knew we were coming,

36:12.960 --> 36:16.635
and so now
he's playing with us.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.915
Um, what worries
me is not

36:19.000 --> 36:20.877
that he can look
like me.

36:20.960 --> 36:25.750
What worries me is that clearly
he can look like anybody.

36:25.840 --> 36:28.149
A lot like anybody.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.117
Exactly.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.395
But he's hurt...

36:34.720 --> 36:38.030
and that's going
to help us.

36:38.120 --> 36:40.016
...a facility that can
access all cellular data.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.160
So I asked my contact to monitor
their phone activity.

36:42.240 --> 36:46.836
She just got back to me with
a confirmed Dr. Julian Serbek.

36:46.920 --> 36:50.230
Phone call about a bullet wound
to the right quad.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.833
Yes!
Nice work, Yong!

36:51.920 --> 36:54.912
- 7:30 at Serbek's office.
- 7:30 a.m.?

36:55.000 --> 36:56.399
Yeah.
That's in 45 minutes.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.456
Guys, we gotta move now!
Pack up! No time to waste!

36:58.480 --> 37:00.056
- I need my coat!
- Barold, wake up!

37:00.080 --> 37:01.991
Which one is it exactly?

37:02.080 --> 37:03.672
Second floor.
The one with the chimney.

37:03.760 --> 37:05.432
You're sure
they're in there?

37:05.560 --> 37:08.256
Infrared sensors picking up two
men matching height and weight.

37:08.280 --> 37:11.192
Definitely a doctor-patient
scenario.

37:13.040 --> 37:15.190
There comes Donnie.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.272
Okay, just erase that.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.112
All right,
it's all rigged up.

37:21.200 --> 37:23.270
See that red car
across the street there?

37:23.360 --> 37:25.316
Rigged it with
a piñata bomb.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.391
The second we see Gunther
come out that door,

37:27.480 --> 37:28.833
we're gonna cut
him up real good.

37:30.200 --> 37:33.237
We got Mia and Barold
across the street...

37:33.320 --> 37:35.151
and Sanaa
in the alley.

37:35.240 --> 37:38.437
And I...
have my poisons.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.919
Exactly.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.638
There's no escape.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.871
This time, we're gonna get him.
We're gonna get him!

37:44.960 --> 37:47.713
Let's get him.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.916
Someone's coming.
Someone's coming.

37:52.680 --> 37:54.716
There he is. That's him.
Donnie, blow it.

37:54.800 --> 37:57.633
Boom goes
the dynamite.

38:00.560 --> 38:02.357
Boom goes
the dynamite.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.238
Boom goes the dynamite.
Donnie, hit it!

38:05.320 --> 38:08.312
I did. I did. Obviously you didn't.
Nothing happened.

38:10.760 --> 38:11.988
Donnie, what the hell?

38:12.080 --> 38:13.399
I didn't touch
that car, man.

38:13.480 --> 38:14.993
Then why did
it just explode?

38:15.080 --> 38:17.230
You told me
to rig the red car...

38:26.120 --> 38:28.680
He knew. He knew
we were coming.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.839
Where's Sanaa?!

38:42.920 --> 38:45.115
She pinned down
cross street.

39:13.360 --> 39:14.588
Okay.

39:18.240 --> 39:20.834
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.318
Okay, I think
it's done.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.236
Gunther's
a fucking dick.

39:55.400 --> 39:58.676
Jesus Christ,
what a waste of cars.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.438
I don't know
what happened, man.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.480
I don't make mistakes when
it comes to explosives.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.238
This is a Gunther move.
I'm telling you.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.276
You okay? Are you okay?
No. No!

40:19.360 --> 40:22.079
I pissed myself, man!
Come on!

40:22.160 --> 40:23.912
Oh, Donnie.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.877
Yong, what is the name
of your contact?

40:25.960 --> 40:29.032
This wasn't her fault.
I want the name!

40:29.120 --> 40:31.315
Somebody told Gunther we were coming!
It wasn't her!

40:31.400 --> 40:33.277
Give me the name.
Give me the name.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.616
Guys, guys, what's that sound?

40:37.560 --> 40:39.312
Wait. I hear it too.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.991
I know
that s-s-s-sound.

40:51.800 --> 40:52.994
What the...

41:10.920 --> 41:13.036
Is it dead?

41:18.160 --> 41:21.118
Is this what poison
feels like?

41:22.400 --> 41:24.231
This sucks.

41:28.680 --> 41:31.672
- Friend now!
- No, no, no! Don't let him do it!

41:42.400 --> 41:43.833
She got him!

41:43.920 --> 41:46.434
Yeah, way to go, Sanaa!

42:06.200 --> 42:08.555
For Yong,
you piece of shit!

42:13.840 --> 42:16.479
Please tell me
there's two bodies.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.312
We got two!
We got two!

42:28.160 --> 42:31.391
To, officially,
the best killers in the biz.

42:31.480 --> 42:32.480
And why are we
the best?

42:32.560 --> 42:34.630
Because we beat the best.
Yeah.

42:34.720 --> 42:35.994
We killed Gunther!

42:39.640 --> 42:41.676
Too bad
Yong died.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.751
Mmm...
Yeah.

42:43.880 --> 42:45.154
Got bit
by a snake.

42:45.240 --> 42:46.753
That's right.
But we won!

42:46.880 --> 42:48.632
Yeah, we did!
We won!

42:48.720 --> 42:50.472
Yes, we certainly did!

42:50.560 --> 42:52.152
Whoa-oh!

42:55.560 --> 42:56.920
Blake,
I was just wondering.

42:56.960 --> 42:58.056
Now that w're done here...
Hey, hold on.

42:58.080 --> 43:00.355
Excuse me? Miss?
Excuse me, hello.

43:00.440 --> 43:02.396
You can't film here.
Oh, no.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.199
It's my buddy's bachelor party.
We're filming the whole thing.

43:05.280 --> 43:06.679
Um...

43:06.760 --> 43:10.753
Can I please get a beer
for my friend and I

43:10.840 --> 43:15.675
and a pitcher
of Mai Tais.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.990
Awesome. Now
that we are done,

43:18.080 --> 43:19.274
are we allowed
to go home?

43:19.360 --> 43:20.713
Karaoke!

43:20.800 --> 43:23.633
Hey, Blake, they got karaoke.
I surprised Donnie!

43:23.720 --> 43:27.474
They have karaoke, baby.
Uh-oh.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.949
Yes! You did it!

43:30.040 --> 43:33.350
- Um, so are we allowed to go home now?
- Mmm! Mm-mmm! Mm-mmm!

43:33.440 --> 43:35.376
- Is it okay if we...
- Job well done, yes.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.391
First thing in the morning,
I promise.

43:37.480 --> 43:41.314
But right now, a toast,
to dead Gunther.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.994
To dead Gunther!

43:44.080 --> 43:46.719
To dead Gunther!

My parents left me.
Yes, I was an orphan.

44:08.320 --> 44:10.629
Lisa left me.
She didn't love me anymore.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.950
Max left me, moved to
South America,

44:13.040 --> 44:14.632
and then I got him
shot in the head.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.638
Why do they
leave? Is it me?

Does that make sense?

I did something that
confirms that I'm good.

44:31.360 --> 44:35.194
Killing Gunther means I'm
good and they're wrong.

Oh, now
we're in trouble.

44:46.360 --> 44:50.751
That's just a fact, but he also...
also has a beautiful mind.

44:50.840 --> 44:54.992
No. No. Which makes him...
Wait for it!

44:55.080 --> 44:57.640
A Criminal Mind.
Okay, it happened.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.995

45:11.280 --> 45:13.350
but we will forever
know about it.

45:13.480 --> 45:14.913
We changed the game.
Whoo!

Don't let him kill me!
Who? Who?

47:27.880 --> 47:30.030
You will die! I will never
speak to you again!

47:30.120 --> 47:33.351
He touched my daughter!
I will murder him! I don't care!

47:33.440 --> 47:35.396
No, no, no! Dad!

47:35.480 --> 47:36.879
Whoa, whoa!
What happened!

47:36.960 --> 47:38.234
He slept
with my little girl!

47:38.320 --> 47:39.816
Donnie and I were just
a little drunk. Okay?

47:39.840 --> 47:41.239
Oh, shit.
I am a grown woman!

47:41.320 --> 47:43.197
I am my own woman, Dad!
Defiler!

47:43.280 --> 47:45.919
Rahmat, Rahmat!
Let's solve this with words, okay?

47:46.000 --> 47:48.160
But right now, all of us have
to get out of here, okay?

47:48.240 --> 47:50.629
I'm sorry, Blake!
I am so enraged!

47:50.760 --> 47:52.591
It's okay.
I understand, I understand.

47:52.720 --> 47:53.976
Please forgive me.
I've gotten you in trouble.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.496
Of course, no,
you're already forgiven.

47:55.520 --> 47:57.750
But listen, you can't go
shooting my team, Rahmat.

47:57.840 --> 47:59.876
You can't do that.
You can't fire at us.

47:59.960 --> 48:01.075
And why
are you even here?

48:01.160 --> 48:02.513
I don't understand.

48:02.600 --> 48:05.831
You called me to inform
me of their indiscretion.

48:05.920 --> 48:07.592
Blake!
What? I did not.

48:07.680 --> 48:09.511
Blake! No, I didn't.
I wouldn't do that.

48:09.600 --> 48:10.736
Yes, you did.
How would I know?

48:10.760 --> 48:12.716
I received your text
one hour ago!

48:12.800 --> 48:16.349
That's impossible. That's not possible.
Why would you do that?!

48:16.440 --> 48:19.318
Exactly! Why would I?
I've been asleep the whole time!

48:19.400 --> 48:22.039
I walked in to find that
pig on top of my angel!

48:22.120 --> 48:24.509
That is a lie, because
I was the one on top!

48:25.960 --> 48:28.190
No, no!
I am going to kill him!

48:28.280 --> 48:30.396
What have you done to my life?!
I didn't do it!

48:30.480 --> 48:32.096
Why would you send that text?!
I didn't send it.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.873
Why would you send it?
He showed me the text!

48:34.960 --> 48:37.428
I can prove I didn't send it.
Gabe. Get Gabe.

48:37.520 --> 48:39.590
Get Gabe.
Oh!

48:39.680 --> 48:41.272
Gabe?

48:41.360 --> 48:43.555
Gabe? Gabe!

48:43.640 --> 48:45.756
I'll break it in.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.478
What is it?

48:47.560 --> 48:48.834
What took you
so long?

48:48.920 --> 48:50.672
And what the hell
are you wearing?

48:50.760 --> 48:52.990
It's a breathing mask
for my sleep apnea.

48:53.080 --> 48:55.674
What's going on?
Mia and Barold.

48:55.760 --> 48:57.637
What do Mia and
Barold have to do

48:57.720 --> 48:59.358
with the text you sent?
Mia and Barold!

48:59.440 --> 49:01.476
Blake, you... Jesus!

49:01.560 --> 49:03.152
- Fuck!
- What!

49:03.240 --> 49:06.471
- Oh, God. Oh, my God.
- What does "EWW" mean?

49:06.560 --> 49:08.357
- Oh, I see.
- Who did this?

49:08.440 --> 49:09.839
Who do you think
did this?

49:09.920 --> 49:13.515
Hey! No, no, no.
We... We killed him.

49:13.600 --> 49:16.034
Obviously, we did not.
Shit.

49:16.120 --> 49:19.396
Why did he have to
place 'em like that?

49:20.640 --> 49:22.153
We have to go.
Gather all your things.

49:22.280 --> 49:24.919
Come on. We have to hurry.
Okay, come on. Gabe, go.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.833
Get out of here. Get out of here.
Come on, move, Gabe!

49:29.920 --> 49:31.478
Gunther's alive.

49:31.560 --> 49:33.312
How is that possible?

49:33.400 --> 49:34.753
I don't know.

49:34.840 --> 49:37.957
Can we still go home?
No.

49:38.040 --> 49:40.349
No, I need you
more than ever now.

49:40.440 --> 49:42.670
You're all I have left.

49:42.760 --> 49:44.876
You still have me.

49:46.440 --> 49:49.398
Donnie is gone, because
Rahmat is trying to kill him.

49:49.480 --> 49:52.995
Sanaa is gone, 'cause she's
trying to stop Rahmat.

49:53.080 --> 49:54.399
Everybody else
is dead.

49:54.480 --> 49:55.629
There is no team.

49:55.760 --> 49:58.069
The mission is
a complete failure,

49:58.160 --> 50:01.755
and things literally
could not be worse.

50:01.840 --> 50:04.718
So I'm going
to go home

50:04.800 --> 50:09.396
and, uh...
reassess the situation.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.356
Stay low. Stay low.

50:16.440 --> 50:19.512
What's going on?
I don't know.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.591
They're in my apartment.

50:23.480 --> 50:26.313
- Who is it?
- I'm not sure.

50:27.680 --> 50:30.194
Let's go. Let's go.
Go, go, go, go.

50:30.280 --> 50:33.192
Uh-oh. Yeah, it's the FBI.
What?

50:33.280 --> 50:34.952
Yeah, you're all over
their system.

50:35.040 --> 50:37.395
He ratted me out to the FBI?
Yes.

50:37.480 --> 50:40.199
You don't do that.
You never do that.

50:40.280 --> 50:41.508
That's, like,
rule number one.

50:41.640 --> 50:43.278
You never rat
another hitman out

50:43.360 --> 50:45.715
to the FBI, to any authority.
I know.

50:45.800 --> 50:47.870
I am going
to kill him.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.438
Is something
funny to you?

50:52.520 --> 50:55.557
No, you're... Well, you're
gonna try to kill him again.

50:55.640 --> 50:57.153
Thank you, Gabe.

50:57.280 --> 51:01.193
Well, now I'm going
to need a place to stay.

51:08.120 --> 51:10.998
Okay, come
on in, guys.

51:11.080 --> 51:13.878
Welcome to
the casa de Gabe.

51:13.960 --> 51:15.951
Couch here
does not fold out.

51:16.040 --> 51:18.554
So, Blake, I think
that's just for you.

51:18.640 --> 51:21.108
You guys...

51:21.200 --> 51:23.395
uh... I guess
just the floor.

51:25.080 --> 51:27.913
Um... I'm just trying
to wrap my head around

51:28.000 --> 51:30.036
what my life
has become.

51:30.120 --> 51:32.680
I can't travel
for the time being.

51:32.760 --> 51:35.832
Gabe ran an I.D. wipe
for me, so that helps,

51:35.920 --> 51:38.514
but I still have to be
careful and lay low.

51:40.800 --> 51:42.836
Frizzy!
Hey, what up?

51:42.920 --> 51:45.753
Yeah, I just got back
from a gig.

51:46.920 --> 51:49.309
Not well.

51:49.400 --> 51:53.632
I just wish I could get in
touch with Donnie or Sanaa.

51:53.720 --> 51:56.917
A bunch of people got killed,
like, right out of the gate.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.319
You know,
boom, boom, boom.

51:58.440 --> 52:00.192
Hey, Donnie, it's me.

52:00.280 --> 52:02.953
Give me a call when you can.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.080
I hope you're still alive.

52:04.160 --> 52:06.196
Sanaa, it's Blaker Caker.

52:06.280 --> 52:09.317
I know you're busy keeping
your dad from murdering Donnie.

52:09.400 --> 52:10.469
Hope that's going well.

52:10.560 --> 52:12.755
Gunther ratted me out
to the Feds.

52:12.840 --> 52:14.273
Pretty much sucks.

52:14.400 --> 52:16.516
Anyway, hit me back
when you can.

52:16.600 --> 52:18.670
Byezees.

52:18.760 --> 52:20.716
I'm so exhausted.

52:20.800 --> 52:24.156
I can't wait to just sleep.

52:24.240 --> 52:27.357
Oh, hey, bro.
This is Jewel.

52:27.440 --> 52:28.759
Hey.

52:28.840 --> 52:31.274
I just need the place
for a little while, okay?

52:31.360 --> 52:34.113
Just, like, a couple
of hours. Is that cool?

52:34.200 --> 52:36.555
I literally have
no place to go.

52:36.640 --> 52:38.870
And on top of that,
I'm hiding from the FBI.

52:38.960 --> 52:40.598
Yeah.

52:40.680 --> 52:43.136
And you want me to wander the
streets of New York City? Mm-hmm.

52:43.160 --> 52:46.470
Uh, Jewel and I will be
having some intimate...

52:46.600 --> 52:48.238
I don't...
sex.

52:48.320 --> 52:50.038
I don't want...
Yeah.

52:50.120 --> 52:51.439
Hey.
Hey, hey.

52:51.560 --> 52:52.993
Um, are you gonna
be much longer?

52:53.080 --> 52:54.798
No, I'll just get
rid of him.

52:54.880 --> 52:57.678
It's just the energy in your apartment is,
like, really affecting me.

52:57.760 --> 53:00.320
Okay. I will be
right in there.

53:00.400 --> 53:02.675
So sorry to have
inconvenienced you, Jewel.

53:02.760 --> 53:03.795
Oh, it's fine.

53:03.880 --> 53:06.440
Yeah, no, don't worry.
Okay.

53:07.680 --> 53:09.079
Yeah, so...

53:10.560 --> 53:13.028
How are
you feeling right now?

53:13.120 --> 53:15.839
Bad. Abandoned.

53:15.960 --> 53:18.758
It's like anyone
who gets close to me

53:18.880 --> 53:20.632
either runs away

53:20.720 --> 53:24.190
or... gets murdered,

53:24.280 --> 53:27.829
and that doesn't
feel great.

53:27.920 --> 53:30.115
Do you think trying to kill
Gunther was a bad idea?

53:30.200 --> 53:31.599
No.

53:31.680 --> 53:36.754
No, if anything, I want
to kill him even more now.

53:39.240 --> 53:40.593
Sorry.

53:40.680 --> 53:43.148
It's Donnie.

53:43.280 --> 53:44.508
Hey.

53:44.600 --> 53:45.953
Yes, where?

53:49.200 --> 53:51.714
- Donnie.
- Hey.

53:51.800 --> 53:53.791
Hey.

53:56.240 --> 53:58.037
Come on.
What are you doing?

53:58.120 --> 53:59.189
Just sit down.

53:59.280 --> 54:02.795
Not next to me.
What are you doing?

54:04.280 --> 54:06.271
Donnie, why are you
in a dress?

54:06.360 --> 54:09.432
I'm in hiding.
It's a disguise, okay?

54:09.560 --> 54:13.030
I shouldn't even be
meeting with you.

54:13.120 --> 54:15.031
You look nice.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.633
Thank you.

54:16.720 --> 54:18.153
It was on sale.

54:18.240 --> 54:20.336
Is this because of Rahmat?
Are things really that bad?

54:20.360 --> 54:23.909
Yeah. Her dad's like an
Iranian bloodhound, man.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.399
Donnie, I need your help.

54:25.480 --> 54:27.471
I can't do it, man.
No. Yes, you can, okay?

54:27.600 --> 54:30.114
Yes, you can. Please. You're
the only one I have, all right?

54:30.200 --> 54:32.256
You don't understand, Blake.
No, you don't understand.

54:32.280 --> 54:35.352
No, you don't understand.
No, you don't understand. I'm out.

54:35.440 --> 54:37.829
For good.
I'm done killing.

54:37.960 --> 54:39.188
What are you talking about?

54:39.280 --> 54:41.555
I'm in love, Blake.

54:41.640 --> 54:45.394
For the first time in my life,
I'm afraid to die.

54:47.640 --> 54:50.074
You're in love with Sanaa?
Yeah.

54:50.160 --> 54:51.816
And it's great, and I
have you to thank for it,

54:51.840 --> 54:53.800
and I'm sorry that I'm
leaving you hanging, but...

54:53.840 --> 54:55.159
Then don't leave
me hanging.

54:55.240 --> 54:57.629
Please. Donnie, please,
I am begging.

54:57.720 --> 55:00.712
Gunther has taken
everything from me.

55:00.800 --> 55:02.233
Except for your life.

55:02.360 --> 55:04.351
When are you gonna admit
it to yourself, Blake?

55:04.440 --> 55:06.158
Gunther's the best.
No.

55:06.280 --> 55:08.510
We are in
way over our heads.

55:08.600 --> 55:11.910
We got so many
of our friends killed.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.672
And honestly...

55:13.760 --> 55:16.228
I don't even know if our hearts
were ever even really in it.

55:16.320 --> 55:18.072
Mine was! Mine still is!
Really? Really?

55:18.160 --> 55:19.752
What do you mean, really?
Yes, really.

55:19.840 --> 55:21.296
So you've done everything in
your power to find Gunther?

55:21.320 --> 55:22.880
You know for a fact
that I have, Donnie.

55:22.960 --> 55:24.616
You walked up to Lisa,
and you said, "Tell me where he is"?

55:24.640 --> 55:26.232
Okay.
You held a gun to her head

55:26.320 --> 55:28.296
and you said, "Tell me where he is"?
That is not fair,

55:28.320 --> 55:29.896
and you know I can't do that.
Oh, screw you.

55:29.920 --> 55:30.936
You know exactly why
I cannot do that.

55:30.960 --> 55:33.110
Because
you're bullshit.

55:33.200 --> 55:35.936
'Cause you're fucking bullshit, and
you're peacocking around this place.

55:35.960 --> 55:37.757
It was never
about Gunther.

55:37.840 --> 55:40.354
It's about you.

55:40.480 --> 55:43.040
You got a lot of
people killed, Blake.

55:43.120 --> 55:44.838
Okay, well,
you are a quitter.

55:44.920 --> 55:47.514
So enjoy your quitter life,
and screw... Oh, jeez. I will.

55:47.600 --> 55:50.319
I'm sorry.

55:50.400 --> 55:52.789
Oh, shit.

55:52.880 --> 55:56.190
Dad! Dad, you have
to stop this!

55:56.280 --> 55:59.317
Hey, Blake,
I'm so sorry.

55:59.400 --> 56:00.833
Dad!

56:02.360 --> 56:03.793
He's right.

56:05.600 --> 56:07.238
Maybe this
was a mistake.

56:07.320 --> 56:09.550
I think I had fooled
myself into thinking

56:09.680 --> 56:13.468
this was some kind of
grand romantic gesture.

56:13.560 --> 56:17.189
I would kill him, and she'd come
running back. I don't know.

56:17.280 --> 56:19.316
But, uh, in reality,

56:19.400 --> 56:21.595
I think
I was being petty,

56:21.680 --> 56:24.672
and I just couldn't
handle being dumped.

57:16.720 --> 57:19.314
They're his letters.

57:19.400 --> 57:23.188
Responses to every letter
I wrote to him.

57:24.600 --> 57:28.309
I had stopped
sending them,

57:28.400 --> 57:30.470
'cause I didn't want
someone to find them

57:30.560 --> 57:32.949
and use her
against me.

57:33.040 --> 57:35.759
Do you know
that she gave me this?

57:35.840 --> 57:37.956
He still has the case?

57:38.040 --> 57:41.669
He carries it
with him everywhere.

57:41.760 --> 57:43.193
It was a gift.

57:43.280 --> 57:46.033
She had it engraved.
Here.

57:48.920 --> 57:50.911
I never stopped
thinking about her.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.436
And when I found out
about her and Gunther,

57:54.520 --> 57:57.478
I got mad. And, and...

57:57.560 --> 57:59.278
Sorry.

58:00.400 --> 58:02.231
Hello.

58:02.320 --> 58:03.719
Yes.

58:04.720 --> 58:07.518
Yes. Wonderful.

58:07.600 --> 58:08.669
Yes, I will.

58:08.800 --> 58:10.392
Thank you.

58:11.400 --> 58:12.469
Ashley.

58:12.560 --> 58:15.597
There he is!

58:15.720 --> 58:17.711
The man of the hour!

58:17.840 --> 58:19.876
Your timing
could not be better.

58:19.960 --> 58:23.953
I can't tell you how
happy I am to see you.

58:24.040 --> 58:25.917
Thank you so much.
I have him. Thank you.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.672
You look like shit.

58:27.760 --> 58:28.988
Yeah. Yeah.

58:29.080 --> 58:33.517
Well, it's been a rough
couple weeks.

58:33.600 --> 58:35.989
Ashley, I messed
up. Bad.

58:36.080 --> 58:39.993
Gunther has killed
everybody.

58:40.080 --> 58:43.959
And... And it's all
my fault.

58:44.080 --> 58:45.440
And I don't
know what to do.

58:45.480 --> 58:48.836
I don't know
what to do, Ashley.

58:48.960 --> 58:51.269
But you're here now.

58:51.360 --> 58:53.510
You're here now, and you
can tell me what to do.

58:53.600 --> 58:55.431
So tell me what to do.

58:56.480 --> 58:57.799
Ashley?

58:58.840 --> 59:00.432
Ashley?

59:02.800 --> 59:04.631
Ashley was a great man.

59:05.680 --> 59:07.750
He was my mentor,

59:07.840 --> 59:10.912
closest thing
I ever had to a father.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.639
His last words were...

59:13.720 --> 59:16.518
"You look like shit."

59:16.600 --> 59:19.751
To me. About me.

59:19.840 --> 59:23.674
But I like to think that that was
just Ashley's way of saying,

59:23.760 --> 59:26.513
"I love you."

59:26.600 --> 59:28.955
I know that it wasn't...

59:29.040 --> 59:32.237
but I need
to believe that,

59:32.320 --> 59:37.758
because I am barely hanging
on by a thread here.

59:39.880 --> 59:41.438
Love you, Ashley.

59:43.720 --> 59:44.994
Thank you
for coming.

59:45.080 --> 59:47.275
Enjoy the cruise.

59:49.120 --> 59:51.793
I'm so sorry, man.

59:51.920 --> 59:53.114
Thank you, Gabe.

59:53.200 --> 59:55.953
I see you brought Jewel.
Yeah.

59:56.040 --> 59:58.349
That was
a little inappropriate.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.716
Hey, at least you got to
be with him when he went.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.358
Yes, that's true.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.876
We're gonna lower the casket.
Okay, thank you.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.910
Hey, buddy.
Donnie.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.029
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.395
I'm so sorry.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.835
I'm so sorry.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.952
It's been really hard.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.758
I didn't expect
to see you here.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.798
Come on, man. It's Ashley.
I couldn't miss it.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.838
Plus, uh, I don't think Rahmat
will kill me at a funeral, so...

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.558
Donnie, run!
He's coming!

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.755
His time has come!

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.990
Enough! Enough, Rahmat!
Blake!

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.718
Not today! Not today!
Blake! Blake!

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.189
I have too much going on!
Blake, no! Please stop!

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.669
Blake, where's the reception
gonna be?

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.558
Go away, Gabe!

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.471
Do what you must,
but I will kill him!

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:56.872
Father, please, for once just listen
to me, okay! You cannot kill him!

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.838
He's not worthy
of you.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.911
I'm pregnant.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.790
Wait. You're pregnant?

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.512
No!

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.828
No!

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.150
No, no,
no, no, no!

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.754
Fuck you, Gunther!

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.831
Fuck you!

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.434
No!

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.109
Gabe? Gabe?

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.158
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.719
Not Gabe.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.189
Oh, my poor sweet Gabe.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.510
My poor sweet Gabe.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.192
You were useless...

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.431
but you're the only one who
stood by me in the end.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.193
And now you're dead,
and it's all my fault.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:04.159
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Gabe.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.589
Take me with you!

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.113
I'm gonna need
a ride home.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.039
Drink it.
Drink it. drink it.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.156
And now
we're having fun!

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.834
Gonna miss your place, Gabe.
Whoo!

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.036
All of this! Never stop.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.473
All of this!

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.073
Okay.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.070
I suck!

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.833
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-buh!

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.309
It's over.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.953
You can turn
the camera off.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.315
Are you sure?

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.960
Yeah. Go home.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.998
I'm sorry that
I threatened to kill you.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.952
Are you
gonna be okay?

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.270
Nope.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:58.593
♪ I'm worthless
and I'm a fool ♪

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.912
♪ And I'm gonna die
a failure ♪

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.672
All right.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.358
I'm sorry, Blake.
It's, um...

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.271
It's been interesting.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:12.592
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.557
Noise complaint.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.312
I'm sorry, neighbors.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:20.791
I'm sorry it's so loud.
It was a bad day.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.232
Lisa?

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.191
How are you here?
Donnie told me.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.391
I'm sorry
about Ashley.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.114
Yeah.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.909
Take care
of yourself, Blake.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.716
Lisa, do you want...

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.760
It's Gunther's address.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.229
No, Blake, no,
okay, don't do this.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.032
I have to do this,
I don't have a choice.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.880
Oh, my God, but he's
going to kill you, man!

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.633
Maybe. But there's
only one way to find out.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:12.600
You can't do
this alone!

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.790
I'm not doing this alone.
You're coming with me.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.313
Absolutely not.
We refuse.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.595
Under no circumstance...

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.035
Okay, we 're coming.
We 're coming.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.991
Donnie, it's Blake.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.548
I got Gunther's
home address.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:35.315
He lives
in Mammoth, California.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.152
Who lives
in Mammoth?!

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.232
I just thought
you deserved to know.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.673
I'm going after him.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.479
Anyway, if anything
should happen to me,

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.152
I just want you to know,
I love you.

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.936
Excuse me, sir, put
your phone on airplane mode.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.336
I'm finishing my call.
Do it right now.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.078
We haven 't left
the gate.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.056
Yeah, and we can't until
you put the phone away.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.056
Okay, fine, I'm putting
it away. Can I say goodbye?

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.640
Donnie, I have to go.
Wish me luck.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.551
I'm gonna go
kill this asshole.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.835
Uh, excuse me?
I wasn't even talking about you.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.512
I was trying
to finish my call!

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:14.040
Ridiculous.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.190
Someone's trying to prove
something, huh?

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.829
I don't even think it's that
nice a house. Do you?

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.749
Fuck you.
Come on.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.279
Gunther?

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.989
Gunther?

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.776
Donnie, what
are you doing here!

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.189
We got your message.
"We"?

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.274
Blake, Donnie, go.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.360
Clear.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.679
C lear.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.632
It's an elevator.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.075
Are you kidding me? Who has
an elevator in their house?

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.760
Let's go. Come on.
All right, come on.

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.711
We're too late.
He's already down here.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.996
Gunther is the greatest...

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.150
- What the fuck?
- Blake?

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:22.152
I don't know what's happening.
What is going on here? What is going on?

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.834
Blake, I never said that you
smelled like a dirty butt.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.776
I think somebody edited this.
Yeah, you think so?

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.109
I do. What is happening?!
Who are you?!

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.953
Why is the footage from that
camera on that screen!

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.474
- Are you fucking with us?!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.039
Who are you?!
What is happening?!

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.111
Get on the ground, now!

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.834
What the fuck is going on?!
Get on the ground!

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.876
What is going on here?
Get down!

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.393
Put your weapons down.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.232
I suck. I suck.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:51.836
Got my friends
killed-killed-killed.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.598
Hello, my friends.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.995
I heard you've been
looking for me.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.558
Well, welcome
to my home.

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.278
How do you
like it so far?

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.516
Hmm? Isn't it cool?

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.552
Hi. My name is...

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.832
and I'm a hitman.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.055
Now, when I found out that there
were a bunch of assassins

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.755
trying to kill me
and film the whole thing,

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.308
I was kind of confused.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:28.317
I mean,
I didn't even know the guys.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:29.992
Why do they want me dead?

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:34.631
But nevertheless,
I got pissed off.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.473
Then, I got inspired.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:40.836
I decided to film
my own documentary

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.956
about their documentary.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:49.229
Now, at first, I wanted
to make a fool of them.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:50.639
Oh, my God!

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.278
Bull's-eye.

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:56.194
Teach them kind of a lesson,
if you know what I mean.

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:58.999
Did he just try
to throw poison at me?

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.671
Give me the bazooka,
will you?

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.911
But quickly,
I became fascinated with them.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.787
This is Ashley,
my old teacher.

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:12.113
Oh, he does not look good.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.192
And... he's down again.

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:18.555
I followed them everywhere.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.598
And when I say everywhere,
I mean everywhere.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.310
Shit! It bit him
right in the neck.

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:26.549
Did you see that?

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.113
I even started
to care for them.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.430
I didn't mean
for that to happen.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.118
I mean, this is wild.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.519
No!

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:39.639
Did they just blow up
my assistant and my driver?

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.069
Those fucking
dick-holes.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.671
- Hello?
- Hello.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.671
FBI?
Yes, we're FBI.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.035
Yes, I would like
to report a hitman.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.872
Wonderful.
Thank you very much.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.351
You have no idea
how great this is

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.034
to finally meet you all
face to face.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.192
- Just in time for us to murder you...
- B-b-b-bup.

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.836
Can we just put our
weapons down and talk?

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.518
What do you say?

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.358
Cappuccino, anyone?

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.876
I mean,
my cappuccino's to die for.

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.599
Come on.
Let's go to the kitchen.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.918
Here we are.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.672
Careful.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.990
It's hot.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.509
Thank you.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:38.195
So you were just screwing
with us this whole time.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.679
No.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.557
Studying you.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.949
Testing you.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.439
Infiltrating you.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:50.069
- Infiltrating?
- Yeah.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.759
Remember this?

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.592
That face is that face.
It's the same.

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.240
It's not that face.
It's not even a good likeness.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.074
Hey, how about this one?

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.596
I hope you do
what you gotta do.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:09.309
It was rad meeting you guys, and
if you ever, ever want to find...

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.119
Gunther, I'm right here!

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.113
Can you believe those guys?
They hated me.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.430
And Blake,
you will love this one.

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.600
Huh?

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.470
Hey, come on in.
He's passed out.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.074
He's a horrible kisser.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.868
This is so fucking
messed up, guys.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.791
Eww!

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:45.792
That's a good shot right there.
I don't know if we can do this.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:47.920
But what the fuck?
It's a joke. Hey, let's leave it.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.030
Hey, take
this shot here.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:55.353
I told you it's hot.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.749
You're fucking sick.
Is this a game to you,

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.273
murdering our friends?

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.430
Oh, you're gonna blame me
for this whole thing?

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.875
Blake, this all happened
because of you.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.279
You planned this.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.511
You got your friends killed.
And why?

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.397
Your generation
is so entitled.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:14.879
You want immediacy.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.633
"I want to be the best,
and I want it right now."

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:19.039
Well, that's bullshit.

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.554
You know how
I became the best?

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.471
I did it
the old-fashioned way.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.710
I earned it.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.997
How do you think I learned to ram
my fist into someone's stomach

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.196
and to break
their goddamn spine?

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:34.670
Or to rip out their heart
and to eat it

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.830
before they even
know they're dead?

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.514
I've been doing this for
almost 50 fucking years,

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.512
so I deserve
to be the best.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.309
And you deserve
what you got.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.073
So what
happens now?

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.039
My documentary
needs an ending.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.120
So the question is,

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:57.158
will it be
a happy ending?

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.832
What does
that even mean?

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.876
Well, as I've said,

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.996
I became quite fond
of all of you.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.834
The thought of killing you
all almost makes me sad.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.989
Almost.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.229
Now here's my offer.

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.713
And you get to choose.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.349
Option one, you go and make
your own happy ending.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.351
You get
a second chance at life.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:19.830
Retire from killing, obviously,
and I'll let you be.

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.753
I'll let bygones be bygones
and the like.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.671
What's the other option?

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:26.512
That I kill you right now.

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:29.319
That's not as enticing.

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.958
We'll go.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.314
What?
No, Donnie, no.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.628
Yes, Sanaa.
No.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.073
You should go.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.355
You know
why you should.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.829
Oh, that's right.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.399
Congratulations.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:51.349
Oh, by the way, Gunther is
a wonderful name for a boy.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.991
How rude.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.470
- You let my crew go, too.
- Of course.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.710
Hey, guys, it's a wrap.

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.308
Nate, Kimmy,
you get out of here.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.310
Are you sure?

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.868
Yes. We're done.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:20.110
Thank you.

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.558
- Holy shit, that was intense.
- Yeah.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.075
I guess you
can turn that off now.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.111
Oh. Okay.

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.957
And then
there were two.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.273
What is it, Blake?

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.592
Can we just be friends?

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.150
I don't think either of us
really want that.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.151
Exactly.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.470
Wouldn't be satisfying, huh?

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.318
Well, maybe this will be.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.755
Bring in our guest.

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.835
Now here is your
second chance, Blake.

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:19.399
This superb creature
that you pushed away.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.040
I hope you believe me
when I tell you

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.832
that I knew nothing
of your relationship

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.150
when she and I
hooked up.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.600
It never would have worked out
between the two of us anyway,

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.316
because she's too wild
of an animal in the sack.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.719
Like pow, pow, pow!

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.108
All night long.

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.192
I mean, fuck,
I'm too old for this shit.

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.274
Besides, I believe that
she's still in love with you.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:48.751
So, as you
can see, you win.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:52.077
The two of you could walk out of
here and live happily ever after.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.151
Or I could shoot
you dead right now

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:57.550
and live even more
happily ever after.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.119
You could.

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:02.471
Just want you to know I gave
explicit orders to my team

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.791
to shoot her to death
if you kill me.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.118
So what is it gonna be?

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.270
The girl...

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.998
or the glory?

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:25.519
Lisa, I am so sorry.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.154
No!

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.719
What a fucking idiot.

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.240
I mean, he fucked up
the whole thing.

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.748
How am I gonna finish
my fucking documentary now?

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.919
Thank you.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.513
Now go.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.635
Go, go!
Hurry! Run!

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.677
You are fucked now!

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:06.909
Oh, no.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.998
So you want to kill me,
huh, you bitch?

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.672
Go ahead. Kill me.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.238
Kill me. Do it.
I'm right here.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.393
You son of a bitch.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.313
Have you changed your mind
now all of a sudden? Huh?

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.600
You know
why you can't kill me?

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.154
Because you're
a fucking loser.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.835
Gunther?
Gunther!

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.070
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.513
No, no, no, no, no!

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.318
No! No!

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:39.079
No! No!

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.512
No!

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.556
Ahh!

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.629
He got
to the chopper.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.512
Who's this?

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:11.592
Oh, this? I don't know.
No, I'm kidding. This is Ava.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.875
She's four-months-old.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.758
She's been holding on to this
finger for about two days.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.717
We have to show the camera.
Watch this.

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:23.396
Ava, whose toes
are these?

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.392
Ava, whose toes are these?
She's not going to answer you.

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.994
They're hers. They're her toes.
Yeah.

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.958
Yeah, Sanaa
and I got married.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.553
Mm-hmm.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.710
I converted to lslam.
My choice.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:38.519
It wasn't because Rahmat
threatened to kill me if I didn't.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:39.600
But did he, though?

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.915
Yes.
Yeah.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.917
You are
my son now. Hmm?

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:53.915
I've killed many people.
I've taken many lives.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.753
Is Daddy being silly?
Is he being silly?

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:01.118
But A va is the first life
that I've ever given.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.239
And, you know, in a way
she's given me life, too.

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.555
Because my dad
now has someone else

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.119
to focus all that
affection on.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:14.109
Okay, there she is!
There she is! Okay! Okay!

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.794
- Who knew he had more to give?
- Come here!

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:20.190
Where is my little goddess!
Where's my little goddess?

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.510
Yes. That face! I would...

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.512
She fell from the sky,
into my arms!

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.830
Oh, my God! I can't get enough.
I really can't.

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.434
Blake? No, I haven't
heard from Blake at all.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:33.796
No, the only thing I heard about that
night was what you guys told me.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:38.635
I feel like I betrayed Blake.
I have a lot of guilt about that.

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:41.518
Not only because I...

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.033
failed him...

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:49.476
but because I've actually never
been happier in my entire life.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.120
And I owe that to Blake.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:57.473
When I got the wedding invitation
from Lisa, I was like... finally.

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:01.439
But... it wasn't him.

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.317
It was some other guy.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:11.759
I met David through
one of our regular clients.

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:15.310
He's great.
He's smart and funny.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.400
He sells time shares.

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:18.277
And he wants a family.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.998
He loves me.

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:22.036
When I got Blake's letters,

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.439
I thought that he had changed,

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.432
but that night proved
that he hadn't.

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.795
I'm not mad. Um...

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.998
it's good to have some closure,
actually.

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:34.456
And I don't know
what happened to him.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.072
I don't really care.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.550
For all I know, him and Gunther
killed one another,

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:47.872
because Gunther certainly
hasn't come after me.

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.311
Guess who.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.637
Well, I retired
from the killing game.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:03.952
As a matter of fact, Blake was
going to be my one last kill,

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:07.476
but I just couldn't find
that son of a bitch.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.790
I planned on killing Lisa, too.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.872
But then I came up
with a better plan.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.033
I said to myself, what would
hurt Blake more than death?

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.151
She doesn't know it yet,

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:23.558
but I was the one that introduced
Lisa to her new husband.

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.313
And a very special
thank-you to Sue,

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.630
who set us up
on our first date.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:34.072
But life is great.

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.594
I mean, I kind of took
my own advice,

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.948
and I started over.

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.150
I moved back to my
home country, Austria,

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:43.152
and I bought a beautiful chalet.
Look at this.

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.753
And it's still
under construction,

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:47.149
because it's two months
late with the remodeling.

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:49.071
But don't get me going
on that one.

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.118
Now, if I ever change my mind
and want to whack someone,

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.016
that fucking contractor
is gonna get terminated.

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.439
That I can tell you.

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.920
Now the great thing is,

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.993
I'm now running a garden co-op
for retirees.

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.194
It's called "Reifes Alter,"

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:09.630
which basically means,
"ripe old age."

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.915
We 're growing
organic vegetables

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.718
and selling it
at the farmers market,

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:17.833
and all the proceeds go to the
Pleasant Eve Retirement Home.

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.478
Ow!

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:23.030
And I'm also coaching
a girls' field hockey team.

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.676
And we ranked number one
in the district,

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:29.911
but we did lose
the state championships.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.119
But of course, we don't listen
to the naysayers.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.713
We never give up.

my first love.

I even built a recording studio
in my own house,

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.833
and I just released
my first single online

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.832

Oh, you never
found Blake, huh?

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.837
No, he disappeared
completely without a trace.

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.480
Hmm. Of course.

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:45.154
Well, I'm actually impressed
that you found me.

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.356
Because I had to move
out of my house that night.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.908
I mean, there were cops
all over the fucking place.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.673
I was so fucking angry.
It was such a huge mess.

I was pissed off.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.472
And Blake better spend
the rest of his life running.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.994
Because if I ever
see him again...

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.313
I did it! I did it! I killed him.
Did you see it?

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.868
Yeah, I saw it. You saw it, right?
You saw me do it?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.797
