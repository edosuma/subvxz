00:01.527 --> 00:03.040
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis :</i>

00:03.207 --> 00:05.402
Currently, Stargate Command
has no vessels...

00:05.607 --> 00:08.440
... capable of engaging the hive ships
before they reach Earth.

00:08.647 --> 00:11.286
Even if we could catch up,
l don’t know how long we’d last.

00:11.487 --> 00:16.117
The lingering stench of what they
transformed you into will never fade.

00:16.327 --> 00:19.637
<i>Wouldn’t it have been prudent
to send a ZPM to Earth on the Daedalus ?</i>

00:19.847 --> 00:21.838
- Colonel Sheppard, is that you ?
- Who’s this ?

00:22.047 --> 00:24.402
Targeting the generators
will be most effective.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.518
This ship has been seriously damaged.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.321
- It’s hard to find something to overload.
- Let Mikey try.

00:31.127 --> 00:32.116
He’s helping us.

00:32.327 --> 00:35.922
- l’ve just opened fire on the transport.
- Beam them directly to the bridge.

00:36.087 --> 00:38.647
It took out our life support.
Backups aren’t responding.

00:38.807 --> 00:41.799
The only breathable air within light-years
is on the Wraith ship.

00:41.967 --> 00:44.322
- There’s also Wraith.
- Unless we send over the gas.

00:44.487 --> 00:47.445
- We finish the plan we started.
- Start sending people over, sir.

00:47.607 --> 00:49.279
They’re all human, the air is good.

00:49.447 --> 00:50.960
l think we’re out of the woods.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.557
<i>Incoming wormhole.</i>

00:56.647 --> 00:58.763
Opening the iris.

01:00.247 --> 01:02.636
Receiving video transmission.

01:03.367 --> 01:06.996
<i>- Stargate Command, this is Atlantis.
- l’m here, Teyla.</i>

01:07.207 --> 01:08.959
Any word about our people ?

01:09.167 --> 01:11.727
<i>Unfortunately, no.</i>

01:13.087 --> 01:16.602
<i>But the hive ship we have been tracking
is still on course for Atlantis.</i>

01:16.807 --> 01:19.560
<i>- We expect its arrival shortly.
- Activate the cloak.</i>

01:20.407 --> 01:22.125
Proceed.

01:29.407 --> 01:31.967
<i>- Cloak is engaged.
- What about our defenses ?</i>

01:32.167 --> 01:34.635
All rail gun positions
are manned and operational...

01:34.847 --> 01:37.680
... and Dr. Beckett
is in the drone control chair.

01:38.567 --> 01:39.920
<i>Patch me through to him.</i>

01:40.447 --> 01:42.483
<i>- Carson ?
- Élizabeth ?</i>

01:42.647 --> 01:43.716
<i>How are you doing ?</i>

01:43.887 --> 01:47.243
- Oh, just peachy, thanks. You ?
- l’m sorry to put you in this position...

01:47.407 --> 01:50.285
... but you’re the only person
besides Sheppard and O’Neill...

01:50.447 --> 01:52.881
... who have actually fired
a drone from that chair.

01:53.167 --> 01:55.840
They’re the two people
l nearly killed when l did that.

01:56.047 --> 01:58.356
<i>- You’Il do fine.
- Is this even necessary ? I mean...</i>

01:58.567 --> 02:01.479
... we’ve got the cloak up,
chances are they won’t find us.

02:01.647 --> 02:04.241
<i>I would agree with you,
but this ship is moving faster...</i>

02:04.447 --> 02:06.756
<i>... than we’ve seen a hive ship move,
which means...</i>

02:06.927 --> 02:09.316
<i>... either it’s a ship
the Daedalus is chasing...</i>

02:09.526 --> 02:12.803
... or they shared the information
they stole from us with other Wraith.

02:13.007 --> 02:15.396
Either way, the cloak
might not do us much good.

02:15.967 --> 02:17.605
Great.

02:24.687 --> 02:26.518
Hive ship just dropped out
of hyperspace.

02:26.687 --> 02:28.200
Dr. Beckett, stand by.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.967 --> 02:43.165
<i>-Receiving a signal.
-Atlantis, this is Sheppard. Come in.</i>

02:43.367 --> 02:46.245
<i>- John ?
- They made it ?</i>

02:46.447 --> 02:50.076
<i>We’re out of food, water, and we haven’t
slept in days, but, yeah, we made it.</i>

02:50.287 --> 02:52.755
<i>So now would not be a good time
to fire on us.</i>

02:53.087 --> 02:57.558
After all, wouldn’t wanna damage
your new hive ship.

04:10.687 --> 04:12.006
<i>This is Daedalus.
We’re clear.</i>

04:13.607 --> 04:16.757
Sorry to sneak up on you, doc.
Subspace communications were down.

04:16.966 --> 04:20.164
- l came this close to blasting you.
- You showed remarkable restraint.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.158
Makes me all the more
confident in you.

04:22.367 --> 04:25.404
- Next time ? Oh, no, no--
- Oh, yeah, the retrovirus worked great.

04:25.607 --> 04:27.325
Really ? How many are there ?

04:27.527 --> 04:33.079
The ship didn’t have a full complement
to begin with, but still, there are a few.

04:46.527 --> 04:48.882
This is a few ?

04:49.087 --> 04:51.362
The official count is just under 200.

04:51.567 --> 04:54.286
A lot were killed in battle,
a lot more killed each other...

04:54.447 --> 04:57.917
... when the gas started changing them.
We should consider ourselves lucky.

04:58.127 --> 05:01.199
A hive ship like this
could carry thousands.

05:01.567 --> 05:02.556
Aye.

05:03.647 --> 05:05.478
<i>Don’t misunderstand me, Dr. Weir.</i>

05:05.687 --> 05:08.997
l’m not here to lecture you on the moral
complexities of your situation.

05:09.207 --> 05:12.836
The IOA has no official position
on the matter one way or the other.

05:13.007 --> 05:15.316
Because when there’s
a tough decision to be made...

05:15.487 --> 05:17.000
... they suddenly have no opinion.

05:17.767 --> 05:21.282
The lives of 200 former Wraith are not
high up on their list of priorities.

05:21.847 --> 05:23.963
But the way you dealt
with the recent crisis...

05:24.127 --> 05:26.880
... and the manner in which
you responded to their authority...

05:27.047 --> 05:31.279
And there’s the issue of whether the
intelligence that allowed these hives...

05:31.487 --> 05:34.877
... to get as far as they did
was passed to any other Wraith colonies.

05:35.087 --> 05:37.317
According to Michael, it was not.

05:37.527 --> 05:41.122
l don’t have to tell you that
your willingness to trust this Wraith...

05:41.327 --> 05:43.477
... is not going to make
for a strong defense.

05:44.047 --> 05:46.641
l didn’t know l was on trial.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.000
Look...

05:50.167 --> 05:53.682
... Pegasus is so far away they never
thought the Wraith would be a threat...

05:53.847 --> 05:56.919
... to anyone outside the members
of the expedition itself.

05:57.127 --> 05:59.197
It was their objection
to having Atlantis...

05:59.367 --> 06:02.757
... under military control that put me
in this position in the first place.

06:03.207 --> 06:05.641
Nothing renews your appreciation
for the military...

06:05.847 --> 06:09.522
... like the threat of invasion
from life-sucking aliens.

06:20.567 --> 06:21.761
Michael ?

06:30.647 --> 06:33.480
Even though l saved
Colonel Sheppard’s life...

06:33.687 --> 06:37.475
... and helped him stop the hives
from reaching Earth...

06:38.007 --> 06:40.077
... you still place me under guard.

06:40.287 --> 06:42.357
You have betrayed
our trust in the past.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.279
Trust ?

06:44.447 --> 06:46.199
l was your prisoner then.

06:46.687 --> 06:48.439
And despite what l’ve done for you...

06:51.207 --> 06:54.165
... here l am once again.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.239
l can’t say l’m surprised.

07:00.247 --> 07:03.444
l wasn’t welcome among my own kind,
why should l be welcome here ?

07:03.767 --> 07:05.166
What are you talking about ?

07:07.247 --> 07:10.762
She looked at me
as if l was some kind of unclean thing.

07:10.967 --> 07:13.162
l may appear as a Wraith again
on the outside...

07:13.327 --> 07:15.921
... but as far
as they’re concerned, l’m--

07:20.207 --> 07:22.198
That is why l need your help.

07:24.007 --> 07:26.282
- What do you want ?
- l can’t stay here...

07:26.487 --> 07:28.921
... and l can’t return to the Wraith...

07:29.087 --> 07:32.124
... which means l need to make
my own way...

07:33.047 --> 07:34.321
... and to do that...

07:40.527 --> 07:44.122
... l need supplies and a ship.

07:45.887 --> 07:49.402
We are grateful for your help,
but we can never release you...

07:49.607 --> 07:53.236
- ... not with the information you possess.
- Then kill me now.

07:54.607 --> 07:55.926
There is another way.

07:56.487 --> 07:59.923
- Take the treatment again ?
- Yes.

08:00.127 --> 08:04.279
What l am is not a disease
you can cure.

08:04.487 --> 08:07.047
Your life as a human
could be long and full.

08:07.247 --> 08:11.843
And if l remember
nothing of what or who l am...

08:12.367 --> 08:16.758
... if this consciousness is erased...

08:17.687 --> 08:19.917
... what is the difference
between that and death ?

08:20.927 --> 08:25.398
And if l do remember
and revert back to my true nature...

08:27.607 --> 08:29.040
... what will happen then ?

08:30.287 --> 08:32.881
Dr. Beckett has made
significant advances.

08:33.087 --> 08:34.804
The treatments
are more effective now.

08:34.967 --> 08:37.162
Eventually, he may find
a permanent solution.

08:37.647 --> 08:40.480
If you really believed that...

08:40.687 --> 08:45.602
... those Wraith you transformed
wouldn’t be in stasis on the ship.

08:47.007 --> 08:49.043
They’d be here...

08:49.247 --> 08:52.444
... reveling in your hospitality.

09:04.087 --> 09:05.361
Come in.

09:05.567 --> 09:07.239
Dr. Weir ?

09:07.887 --> 09:09.764
Mr. Woolsey.

09:10.167 --> 09:13.523
The IOA has decided that,
for the time being...

09:13.727 --> 09:16.764
... you should continue to head
the Atlantis expedition.

09:17.447 --> 09:19.358
You’re surprised ?

09:20.047 --> 09:22.436
Yes, l am.

09:22.647 --> 09:25.878
l guess this means that international
mistrust of the U.S. military...

09:26.087 --> 09:30.638
... is far more powerful
than their fear of life-sucking aliens.

09:30.887 --> 09:34.163
The truth is, the delegates are split.

09:34.367 --> 09:37.962
In order to avoid a deadlock, they
decided on a temporary reinstatement...

09:38.167 --> 09:42.957
... pending a detailed report
on the situation in Pegasus.

09:43.167 --> 09:46.125
- Written by ?
- Me.

09:47.047 --> 09:49.242
l’Il be going back
to Atlantis with you.

09:49.927 --> 09:52.157
Have you ever been
off-world before, Mr. Woolsey ?

09:52.367 --> 09:54.801
Sure. Once.

09:55.007 --> 09:58.124
- And how did that go for you ?
- l was nearly killed.

09:59.007 --> 10:02.602
Well, we will do our best to make sure
that doesn’t happen this time.

10:05.487 --> 10:09.241
Stargate Command has put in a request
to the Asgard for transportation ?

10:09.407 --> 10:11.443
They don’t have
a lot of ships to spare...

10:12.087 --> 10:15.284
... but that will shave almost two weeks
off our travel time.

10:16.727 --> 10:18.922
l’ve never met an Asgard.

10:19.767 --> 10:23.362
You, l think, will love them.
They got a great sense of humor.

10:23.567 --> 10:25.046
Really ?

10:25.967 --> 10:27.195
No.

10:39.087 --> 10:40.679
You figure out how to fly this yet ?

10:40.887 --> 10:44.163
Yeah. Fly, shimmy, spin like a top.
You didn’t think it’d be hard ?

10:44.367 --> 10:46.642
Just proves my confidence in you
wasn’t misplaced.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.680
We can’t get the ship to respond
to anything but the basics.

10:49.887 --> 10:51.206
That doesn’t do us much good.

10:51.367 --> 10:54.598
Really ? Look, all the more
sophisticated systems, like navigation...

10:54.767 --> 10:58.077
... respond to Wraith neural interface,
in the same way Puddle Jumpers...

10:58.287 --> 11:00.596
... can only be controlled by people
with ATA genes.

11:00.767 --> 11:04.601
- So we still need a Wraith to fly it.
- l’m working on a manual override.

11:05.167 --> 11:07.362
Just haven’t had much luck yet.

11:07.647 --> 11:11.083
What about Teyla ? Teyla’s got the
Wraith gene thing. Maybe she can fly it.

11:11.287 --> 11:13.676
That’s worth a try,
but that’s not the only problem.

11:13.887 --> 11:16.765
At least half of the ship’s
power generating capacity is gone.

11:16.967 --> 11:20.516
Even if l had access to spare parts,
which l don’t, l doubt l could fix it.

11:20.727 --> 11:23.525
Now, if we’re gonna fly this thing
and hope for weapons...

11:23.727 --> 11:26.287
... we need to cut back
on our current power consumption.

11:26.487 --> 11:28.523
- Meaning what ?
- Meaning the 200 prisoners...

11:28.687 --> 11:31.520
... we’ve got in stasis,
we can’t keep them in there forever.

11:39.367 --> 11:42.200
- Are you my executioner ?
- l wish.

11:50.847 --> 11:53.839
l’m just glad
he’s not gonna remember this.

12:03.567 --> 12:06.001
All right, this is weird.

12:06.207 --> 12:10.325
- Why ? It’s just a bunch of guys.
- l know what they really are.

12:11.047 --> 12:13.686
Keep that to yourself
and try to act normal.

12:14.287 --> 12:17.723
Colonel Sheppard,
l need to speak with you.

12:18.007 --> 12:19.201
l’m sorry...

12:19.407 --> 12:22.683
Oh, my name is Lathan.
At least that’s what l’ve been told.

12:22.887 --> 12:25.276
- Okay.
- Many of us have questions, colonel.

12:25.487 --> 12:27.398
Like how long
we’re going to be kept here.

12:27.607 --> 12:30.519
- That’s up to Dr. Beckett.
- He said he doesn’t know.

12:30.727 --> 12:32.957
Which means he doesn’t know
the exact date.

12:33.167 --> 12:36.762
Sorry, this is a medical situation,
and he has medical reasons.

12:36.967 --> 12:39.197
You people are under quarantine.

12:39.407 --> 12:40.601
Why only the men ?

12:40.807 --> 12:44.482
Your women are immune to the strain,
so are most of my people.

12:44.687 --> 12:46.678
- We’ve been over this a few times.
- l know--

12:46.887 --> 12:51.517
Until Dr. Beckett can clear you,
there’s nothing l can do.

13:04.687 --> 13:06.962
- How’s it coming ?
- l’m gonna need more time.

13:07.167 --> 13:10.477
You’d be better off conducting
this research back on Atlantis.

13:10.687 --> 13:13.440
And what, just leave them here ?

13:13.647 --> 13:16.320
That was the plan,
you remember that, Carson ?

13:16.527 --> 13:17.721
But they’re not ready yet.

13:17.927 --> 13:20.964
You were supposed to teach them
to administer the drug themselves.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.283
l have trained several to act
as my assistants.

13:23.447 --> 13:24.960
Then there should be no problem.

13:25.967 --> 13:29.801
There’s more here to what l’m doing
than just sticking needles in their arms.

13:29.967 --> 13:32.686
For one, l have to make sure
there’s no signs of reversion.

13:32.927 --> 13:35.361
This planet has no gate.
They’ve got no way off.

13:35.527 --> 13:37.085
Whatever happens, we’re covered.

13:37.287 --> 13:40.199
- That’s not what l meant.
- Have any of them started to remember ?

13:40.407 --> 13:44.161
l don’t think so. The drug keeps them
stable as long as they get a daily dose.

13:44.487 --> 13:47.763
We don’t have the manpower
or the resources to babysit them forever.

13:47.967 --> 13:51.084
If l can’t come up with a solution,
we’Il have to abandon them ?

13:51.287 --> 13:53.357
- Eventually.
- Then what ?

13:53.527 --> 13:55.199
They’Il turn back into the Wraith...

13:55.407 --> 13:59.036
... and without any other food supply,
they’Il start feeding on each other.

13:59.247 --> 14:01.238
Well, l’m not ready
to give up just yet.

14:01.407 --> 14:04.046
And like it or not,
for the moment, they are human...

14:04.207 --> 14:05.720
... and they’re my responsibility.

14:05.887 --> 14:09.436
- l’Il stay until the first resupply mission.
- That won’t be for another week.

14:09.647 --> 14:13.037
They’Il bring enough food to last them
until they can harvest their own.

14:13.327 --> 14:15.522
l’Il be perfectly safe.

14:17.887 --> 14:20.242
We’re leaving a security team
with you.

14:38.767 --> 14:40.246
What did he say ?

14:40.447 --> 14:43.644
Nothing. He won’t tell us anything.

14:43.887 --> 14:45.923
He’s hiding something.

14:47.007 --> 14:48.235
Like what ?

14:48.447 --> 14:50.438
l only know
that something’s not right.

14:50.927 --> 14:53.157
Everything they’ve told us
about our homeworld...

14:53.367 --> 14:56.325
... the plague, how they rescued us...

14:56.607 --> 14:58.518
... l don’t remember a single part.

14:59.647 --> 15:01.956
Because memory loss
is one of the symptoms.

15:02.607 --> 15:04.518
How do you know that’s true ?

15:04.727 --> 15:06.763
We don’t know them.

15:06.967 --> 15:08.923
We don’t even know ourselves.

15:10.607 --> 15:11.596
They’re helping us.

15:11.807 --> 15:14.275
By keeping us trapped here
with barely enough food...

15:14.487 --> 15:17.320
... and no idea when
or if we’Il ever be allowed to leave ?

15:17.527 --> 15:19.165
l say that’s not good enough.

15:20.407 --> 15:21.601
What are you suggesting ?

15:23.047 --> 15:27.723
They only have a handful of soldiers.
We outnumber them 10-to-1.

15:28.327 --> 15:30.397
- And then what ?
- They have some sort of ship.

15:30.607 --> 15:33.280
It’s how we got here.
If we have hostages--

15:33.487 --> 15:35.443
What if they’re telling the truth...

15:35.647 --> 15:38.241
... and we are really carrying
some kind of deadly plague ?

15:39.247 --> 15:42.205
Even if we somehow survive
and get away...

15:42.407 --> 15:46.036
... all we’Il be doing is spreading
this disease wherever we go.

15:46.767 --> 15:48.723
Do you really wanna risk that ?

15:48.927 --> 15:51.999
If we don’t act before that ship leaves,
we’Il be stranded forever.

15:52.207 --> 15:55.404
Michael’s right, Lathan. It’s too risky.

16:11.527 --> 16:13.279
Colonel Caldwell ?

16:13.927 --> 16:15.519
- Woolsey.
- Mind if l join you ?

16:15.727 --> 16:17.365
Of course.

16:17.607 --> 16:20.326
- How are you settling in ?
- l’m not sure about this uniform.

16:20.527 --> 16:22.677
You stand out more in a suit and tie.

16:23.327 --> 16:26.399
Believe me, l’ve done enough
of these investigations to realize...

16:26.607 --> 16:29.599
... that no amount of camouflage
is going to disguise who l am...

16:29.807 --> 16:31.035
... or what l’m doing here.

16:31.247 --> 16:34.319
Are you expecting
something less than full cooperation ?

16:34.687 --> 16:36.803
We’re just having a conversation.

16:37.967 --> 16:41.039
<i>As commander of the Daedalus,
l have standing orders to help out...</i>

16:41.207 --> 16:46.156
... whenever possible,
but l’m not a member of this expedition.

16:46.367 --> 16:48.198
l don’t answer to the IOA...

16:48.407 --> 16:52.366
... and unless otherwise
directed by my superiors...

16:53.087 --> 16:54.998
... l don’t have to answer
your questions.

16:58.207 --> 17:01.643
The only reason you’re not the
commander of Atlantis is that Dr. Weir...

17:01.847 --> 17:04.680
... insisted that post
go to Colonel Sheppard.

17:04.887 --> 17:07.002
If she were to leave...

17:07.686 --> 17:10.645
... you would be the most likely
candidate to take over.

17:11.807 --> 17:13.035
That’s not why you’re here.

17:13.926 --> 17:16.441
The IOA doesn’t really want
militarization.

17:16.646 --> 17:19.400
They’re just afraid they may have
no other choice.

17:21.446 --> 17:24.007
l think you’ve already spoken
to Dr. Weir.

17:24.207 --> 17:25.685
No.

17:26.367 --> 17:29.006
l’ve just been around long enough
to know what’s going on.

17:31.207 --> 17:34.404
It sounds like you’re saying
you won’t come out against Dr. Weir...

17:34.607 --> 17:37.440
... only because you’re not confident
of the outcome.

17:38.367 --> 17:41.120
No, what l’m saying, Mr. Woolsey...

17:42.127 --> 17:44.197
... is have a pleasant evening.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.598
You guys head back to the ship.

17:50.247 --> 17:52.966
Okay, doc, last chance.
We’re packed up and ready to roll.

17:53.167 --> 17:55.442
Colonel, we’ve got a problem.
Lathan’s missing.

17:55.647 --> 17:59.037
He didn’t turn up for his last treatment
and nobody’s seen him. Have they ?

17:59.247 --> 18:01.442
No, but...

18:01.647 --> 18:03.399
But what ?

18:04.047 --> 18:06.561
It’s all right, Michael.
Tell him what you told me.

18:07.007 --> 18:09.680
Lathan’s convinced
this is some kind of elaborate lie.

18:09.887 --> 18:12.003
l told him you were doing
your best to help us.

18:12.167 --> 18:16.445
That maybe the sickness was playing
with his mind, but he wouldn’t listen.

18:16.847 --> 18:19.725
- You’re saying he’s not lost, he’s hiding.
- It’s possible.

18:19.927 --> 18:22.043
It’s best if we find him
as soon as possible...

18:22.207 --> 18:24.437
... before any symptoms
of the plague reoccur.

18:26.327 --> 18:29.239
- Okay, let’s get a search party going.
- We’d like to help.

18:30.527 --> 18:31.960
He is one of us.

18:43.927 --> 18:46.646
- Anything ?
- Nothing.

18:46.847 --> 18:47.882
Morrison, report.

18:48.087 --> 18:50.885
<i>We’re just coming up on the river.
Still no sign of him, sir.</i>

18:51.087 --> 18:53.078
All right, keep me posted.

19:08.007 --> 19:09.486
Michael.

19:10.447 --> 19:12.324
Lathan.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.358
What are you doing out here ?

19:14.567 --> 19:17.001
- l’m proving a point.
- You missed a treatment.

19:17.207 --> 19:19.801
l know, but l’m starting to remember.

19:19.967 --> 19:22.640
It’s just flashes, images in my head...

19:22.807 --> 19:25.526
... but something’s
definitely coming back to me.

19:25.727 --> 19:27.126
Don’t you see what this means ?

19:27.327 --> 19:29.636
They’re not curing us,
they’re keeping us this way.

19:30.047 --> 19:32.277
We must make our move, and quickly.

19:33.967 --> 19:37.323
l’m sorry, but you should have stayed
at the camp.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.921
<i>- Colonel Sheppard.
- Go ahead.</i>

19:47.127 --> 19:48.719
<i>We found him, sir.</i>

19:48.927 --> 19:49.996
What’s your location ?

19:50.767 --> 19:53.440
We’re halfway up the ridge
that runs south of the camp.

19:53.647 --> 19:56.161
He must have been climbing down
and lost his footing.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.125
Are you saying he’s injured ?

19:58.567 --> 19:59.966
No, sir.

20:00.167 --> 20:01.839
He’s dead.

20:18.207 --> 20:20.926
l’ve prepared the injections
for this morning’s first group.

20:21.127 --> 20:22.560
On you go.

20:26.487 --> 20:28.762
You’Il be fine.
l’ve seen you do it a dozen times.

20:28.967 --> 20:30.685
Besides, l’ve got work to do here.

20:30.887 --> 20:33.117
You’re going to examine the body ?

20:33.367 --> 20:36.598
The cause of death is quite obvious.
His neck was broken.

20:36.767 --> 20:39.600
But there are tests l can perform
that could help my research.

20:39.767 --> 20:42.361
At least that way
something good might come of this.

20:55.727 --> 21:00.039
We’ve all logged more than a few miles
these past few weeks.

21:00.447 --> 21:03.519
l’d just like to say that seeing you now,
sitting across from me...

21:04.847 --> 21:07.122
... looking at your faces...

21:10.927 --> 21:13.077
... it makes me feel very...

21:15.807 --> 21:17.320
You don’t have to say it.

21:17.527 --> 21:20.678
- We feel the same way you do.
- Oh, she feels hungry too ?

21:23.407 --> 21:26.080
Now, Teyla, l understand
navigating the hive ship...

21:26.287 --> 21:28.960
... wasn’t a particularly
pleasant experience.

21:29.167 --> 21:32.682
The neural interface
was quite exhausting.

21:32.887 --> 21:36.243
That was just flying straight.
She’Il never pull off anything complex...

21:36.447 --> 21:38.756
... like combat maneuverability,
weapons control...

21:38.967 --> 21:40.923
How many maneuvers
can you pull off ?

21:41.087 --> 21:44.318
Well, does standing still
count as a maneuver ?

21:44.487 --> 21:46.045
No.

21:46.807 --> 21:51.005
Sorry l’m late. My interviews
are running a little longer than expected.

21:51.767 --> 21:53.678
And you are. . ?

21:54.207 --> 21:57.438
Richard Woolsey. He is chief liaison
to the international committee...

21:57.647 --> 21:59.478
... that oversees
the Atlantis expedition.

21:59.687 --> 22:02.645
He will be conducting
individual interviews with each of you.

22:02.847 --> 22:06.556
As well as observing
all senior staff meetings.

22:06.767 --> 22:08.120
Right.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.761
So, what did l miss ?

22:10.967 --> 22:14.596
Rodney was about to run down the
progress made adapting the hive controls.

22:14.807 --> 22:16.206
Excellent. Please continue.

22:18.487 --> 22:19.920
Thanks.

22:31.607 --> 22:35.236
<i>Dr. Beckett, this is Lieutenant morrison.
What’s your location ?</i>

22:35.447 --> 22:37.563
l’m on the ridge
where Lathan’s body was found.

22:37.927 --> 22:40.361
If you don’t mind my asking,
what are you doing there ?

22:40.767 --> 22:43.839
l wanted to check on something.
l think we may have a problem.

22:44.287 --> 22:45.925
What kind of problem ?

22:46.127 --> 22:50.837
<i>I was so caught up running tests on
Lathan’s tissues, I almost didn’t notice.</i>

22:51.047 --> 22:52.082
Notice what ?

22:52.447 --> 22:54.244
There isn’t enough blood on the ground.

22:54.407 --> 22:56.477
Meaning his heart
wasn’t pumping when he fell.

22:56.967 --> 22:59.083
<i>He definitely died
when his neck was snapped...</i>

22:59.287 --> 23:02.120
<i>... but I think the rest of his injuries
occurred postmortem...</i>

23:02.727 --> 23:04.957
... presumably to make it
look like an accident.

23:06.887 --> 23:08.445
Look, it’s gonna be dark soon.

23:08.647 --> 23:11.719
You’d better start back now.
We’Il talk about it when you get here.

23:11.927 --> 23:13.406
All right.

23:23.367 --> 23:28.839
It would appear from this incident
that the lies you’re telling these people...

23:29.047 --> 23:31.277
... are beginning to wear a bit thin.

23:32.007 --> 23:34.567
One adverse reaction out of 200.

23:34.767 --> 23:36.280
Do you hold out much hope...

23:36.487 --> 23:39.684
... for the long-term success
of this little science project ?

23:39.887 --> 23:41.639
That’s not what this is.

23:41.847 --> 23:46.477
You may have never set out to create
this community, but you did create it.

23:47.207 --> 23:51.325
We did what we had to do
in order to survive.

23:51.527 --> 23:54.166
l’m sure it seemed like a good idea
at the time.

23:56.167 --> 24:00.524
Even if Dr. Beckett comes up with what
appears to be a long-term solution...

24:01.287 --> 24:04.199
... would we ever trust them enough
to integrate them into any...

24:04.367 --> 24:06.323
... society of humans ?

24:08.087 --> 24:10.476
- Probably not.
- Which brings me to my first question.

24:10.647 --> 24:11.796
What do you want me
to say ?

24:11.967 --> 24:15.164
l supported Élizabeth’s decision
to form an alliance with Michael...

24:15.327 --> 24:20.481
... and l supported her decision
to put all those people on the planet.

24:20.767 --> 24:25.204
That support hardly shines through
when you hesitate to call them people.

25:04.447 --> 25:07.166
Out of curiosity, how much trouble
is it gonna cause you...

25:07.367 --> 25:09.278
... if l knock this Woolsey guy
in the head ?

25:09.487 --> 25:12.320
- May l ask why you’d like to do that ?
- Just an impulse l had.

25:12.527 --> 25:15.087
One l suspect l’m gonna have again
next time l see him.

25:15.287 --> 25:17.118
He may not even have
to say anything.

25:17.807 --> 25:20.605
l’ve never seen you like this.
What did Woolsey say to you ?

25:21.207 --> 25:23.767
Besides judging every damn decision
you’ve ever made ?

25:24.647 --> 25:27.400
John Sheppard,
are you defending my honor ?

25:28.567 --> 25:31.525
And judging me for agreeing with you.

25:32.727 --> 25:33.876
Don’t be too hard on him.

25:34.087 --> 25:38.444
l think, of all the circling wolves,
he’s the least likely to actually bite.

25:38.647 --> 25:41.605
In fact, he might even convince
the others to leave us alone.

25:42.927 --> 25:45.157
All right, so...

25:46.207 --> 25:48.118
... no head-knocking.

25:49.487 --> 25:51.921
It’s the thought that counts.

26:13.567 --> 26:18.687
Lieutenant Morrison,
this is Dr. Beckett. Come in.

26:20.167 --> 26:21.919
Morrison.

26:24.647 --> 26:28.276
l’m afraid the lieutenant and his men
are indisposed.

26:31.087 --> 26:34.204
Listen to me. You’re sick.
You need to take your medication now.

26:34.407 --> 26:36.398
It’s too late for that, doctor.

26:36.607 --> 26:39.883
l’ve regained enough memory to know
you’ve done this to me not once...

26:40.087 --> 26:41.805
... but twice.

26:42.047 --> 26:45.642
You witnessed how hurt,
how betrayed l felt the first time.

26:46.287 --> 26:49.120
Well, try to imagine how l feel now.

26:49.327 --> 26:52.205
- Why’d you have to kill Lathan ?
- He was stirring up trouble.

26:52.407 --> 26:55.763
l knew our only chance was to wait
until Sheppard left with the soldiers.

26:55.927 --> 26:58.725
- Most of them anyway.
- With the ship gone, what’s the point ?

26:58.887 --> 27:01.560
- You’ve got no hope of escape.
- That’s where you’re wrong.

27:05.367 --> 27:06.482
What have we got, Rodney ?

27:06.687 --> 27:08.643
Long-range sensors
picked up a hive ship.

27:08.847 --> 27:10.075
Coming this way ?

27:10.287 --> 27:12.005
No. Wait a minute.

27:12.167 --> 27:15.876
- This doesn’t make any sense.
- What ?

27:17.127 --> 27:21.598
It’s headed straight for the planet
where we left Beckett and the prisoners.

27:28.927 --> 27:31.919
There’s no reason for the Wraith
to be interested in that planet.

27:32.127 --> 27:35.278
No stargate, and no indication
it ever supported a human population.

27:35.447 --> 27:37.597
It is completely off the grid.

27:37.807 --> 27:40.719
l think we have to consider
the possibility that we have a leak.

27:40.927 --> 27:44.317
- You mean a spy ?
- Not necessarily in the city itself.

27:44.527 --> 27:47.325
l would begin by focusing
on our contacts...

27:47.487 --> 27:49.876
... within the various
indigenous populations, including--

27:50.087 --> 27:53.397
- If you believe any Athosians--
- Let’s not jump to any conclusions here.

27:53.567 --> 27:56.764
Isn’t it true there are humans
in this galaxy who serve the Wraith...

27:56.967 --> 27:57.956
... even worship them ?

27:58.167 --> 28:01.000
How hard would it be
to infiltrate one of our allied groups ?

28:01.207 --> 28:04.279
Do you think we post this
information on the city bulletin board ?

28:04.487 --> 28:08.162
If the Wraith had that information,
they’d be on their way to Atlantis...

28:08.367 --> 28:11.086
... not some nameless planet
with a couple of hundred people.

28:11.287 --> 28:14.359
We need to focus on getting
those people out of there.

28:14.567 --> 28:17.127
If the Wraith find them
and figure out what they are...

28:17.327 --> 28:19.238
We’ve got a problem, again.

28:19.447 --> 28:21.403
- How much time do we have ?
- Two days.

28:21.607 --> 28:24.405
<i>We could... Well, you could
beat them there in the Daedalus.</i>

28:24.567 --> 28:28.162
The hyperdrive is still offline.
Hermiod needs at least another 24 hours.

28:28.367 --> 28:32.758
- We should light a fire under his bony--
- That still might not be good enough.

28:34.847 --> 28:38.203
- If we leave right now in the hive ship. . ?
- We’d be cutting it close.

28:39.407 --> 28:42.558
What are our chances of surviving
a ship-to-ship encounter ?

28:42.767 --> 28:46.680
If l can get the manual interface
working, l’d say less than slim.

28:51.447 --> 28:52.800
Do what you can on the way.

29:06.527 --> 29:08.358
How many have reverted ?

29:08.567 --> 29:12.242
Those you saw in the forest,
plus a few more.

29:12.447 --> 29:14.278
And the others ?

29:14.527 --> 29:17.963
They’Il serve as an offering to the hive
that’s coming for us.

29:18.167 --> 29:22.080
- That’s hardly bloody fair.
- The strong survive, doctor.

29:23.207 --> 29:26.005
The few of us who began to realize
something was wrong...

29:26.207 --> 29:28.926
... got together and formed a plan...

29:29.087 --> 29:30.998
... even while on the medication.

29:32.127 --> 29:34.561
The weaker minds among us
will stay that way...

29:34.967 --> 29:38.721
... thanks to your drugs
and the training you gave us.

29:38.927 --> 29:41.646
If your memory’s coming back,
remember what happened...

29:41.807 --> 29:43.798
... last time you tried
to rejoin the Wraith.

29:44.007 --> 29:45.838
It will be enough to escape this rock.

29:46.047 --> 29:49.642
What do you need me for ? There must
be a reason you’re keeping me alive.

29:49.967 --> 29:52.242
l need to know
what secondary security measures...

29:52.447 --> 29:55.598
... Colonel Sheppard
put in place before he left.

29:58.207 --> 30:00.198
What are you talking about ?

30:00.647 --> 30:03.207
The more my memory returns,
the more l begin to doubt...

30:03.407 --> 30:06.922
... that he would have left us here
without setting up some kind of fail-safe.

30:07.127 --> 30:10.244
There’s no way off this planet.
That was the fail-safe.

30:10.447 --> 30:14.884
How many years will l have to take away
before you tell me what l want to know ?

30:15.367 --> 30:19.280
That’s hardly a threat, since you’re
obviously gonna kill me anyway.

30:19.607 --> 30:23.236
You underestimate
your own value, doctor.

30:23.447 --> 30:26.519
Look, they don’t tell me
this sort of thing. l’m just a doctor.

30:28.847 --> 30:32.237
Maybe you shouldn’t have been
so quick to kill Lieutenant Morrison.

30:33.127 --> 30:38.281
l don’t like to question military men.
They’re like our own Wraith warriors.

30:38.487 --> 30:40.239
Unimaginative...

30:40.447 --> 30:42.836
... rigid thought patterns.

30:43.687 --> 30:46.724
But you, on the other hand...

30:47.047 --> 30:50.198
... are trained to have an open mind...

30:51.047 --> 30:55.279
... and you have a strong sense
of empathy toward others.

30:55.487 --> 30:59.036
It’s not as strong
as it used to be, believe me.

31:02.367 --> 31:05.484
You’re exactly what l need.

31:06.367 --> 31:08.244
Now...

31:09.207 --> 31:11.163
... let’s begin.

31:33.007 --> 31:34.679
- Do we have weapons yet ?
- Sort of.

31:34.847 --> 31:35.882
What does that mean ?

31:36.047 --> 31:38.277
We can fire,
but not in any particular direction.

31:38.487 --> 31:39.681
You’Il have to do better.

31:39.887 --> 31:42.321
No one wants to survive this mission
more than l do.

31:42.527 --> 31:44.882
We’re using up a lot of power
to maintain speed.

31:45.087 --> 31:48.284
- We’re not gonna have a lot left.
- We’re going fast to avoid fighting.

31:48.487 --> 31:50.159
Theoretically.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.517
Just keep working.

31:58.807 --> 32:00.877
<i>Atlantis, this is Daedalus.
We’re ready to go.</i>

32:01.087 --> 32:04.363
Are you sure you wanna do this ?
l understand Hermiod isn’t too happy...

32:04.567 --> 32:07.127
... about having the hyperdrive
in service so soon.

32:07.327 --> 32:11.036
He’s cleared us to fly. Whether or not
he’s happy about it is beside the point.

32:11.247 --> 32:14.000
Anyway, l’m sure Colonel Sheppard
would appreciate the help.

32:14.207 --> 32:15.196
<i>Thank you.</i>

32:15.407 --> 32:18.683
<i>- Daedalus out. Set a course.
- Yes, sir.</i>

32:34.367 --> 32:37.484
That’s it. We’re out of hyperspace.

32:38.847 --> 32:40.280
You all right ?

32:40.487 --> 32:43.081
l believe l have been able to establish
a stable orbit.

32:43.287 --> 32:45.801
All right, nice work.
Any sign of the other hive ship ?

32:46.007 --> 32:46.996
No, we’re clear.

32:47.207 --> 32:50.517
- All right, patch me through to camp.
- All right, just give me a second.

32:52.527 --> 32:54.165
That’s weird.

32:54.807 --> 32:57.799
A bunch of secondary systems
just came online.

32:58.007 --> 32:59.486
You’re a genius, Rodney.

33:00.247 --> 33:02.238
True, but l didn’t do it.

33:02.447 --> 33:04.358
It’s like they just woke up
by themselves.

33:06.167 --> 33:07.646
They’re keyed into the sensors.

33:07.807 --> 33:11.197
- The ship must have detected something.
- Detected what ?

33:13.527 --> 33:15.757
- Wraith life signs.
- From the planet ?

33:15.967 --> 33:18.356
- How many ?
- There’s 20 or 30.

33:18.567 --> 33:21.081
- What about human ?
- Still well over 100.

33:21.247 --> 33:23.636
- So some reverted.
- They’Il be feeding on each other.

33:23.807 --> 33:25.684
What about Beckett
and Morrison’s team ?

33:25.887 --> 33:28.447
l have no way to distinguish them
from other life signs.

33:28.647 --> 33:30.444
l can’t say for sure either way.

33:33.887 --> 33:36.037
How did they contact
the ship so far out ?

33:36.207 --> 33:38.437
l have no idea.
Teyla, what do you think ?

33:38.607 --> 33:43.158
It is possible that a group acting together
could communicate over larger distances.

33:43.327 --> 33:44.396
Live and learn.

33:44.767 --> 33:48.157
- l’Il live some more, hopefully.
- What about the fail-safe device ?

33:48.327 --> 33:52.320
<i>- What kind of kill zone are we looking at ?
-Everything in a three-mile radius is toast.</i>

33:52.487 --> 33:54.284
You sure ?
We’ve got no margin for error.

33:54.447 --> 33:56.722
<i>The blast radius
doesn’t just stop at three miles.</i>

33:56.887 --> 33:59.162
What about the ones
that are still human ?

34:01.207 --> 34:02.879
There’s nothing we can do for them.

34:03.087 --> 34:05.726
Well, l suppose
we could not incinerate them.

34:06.607 --> 34:08.199
If Michael got his memory back...

34:08.367 --> 34:11.085
... they could all know about Atlantis
and how to find Earth.

34:11.286 --> 34:12.639
We can’t take that chance.

34:13.246 --> 34:15.806
<i>Once we get our people out,
we’Il give you the signal...</i>

34:16.607 --> 34:18.677
... you set off the nuke.

34:59.207 --> 35:00.845
Carson.

35:03.447 --> 35:05.483
He’s barely conscious.

35:06.807 --> 35:08.798
- Did you find the others ?
- They were fed on.

35:08.967 --> 35:12.198
- There’s not much of them left.
- Help me get him up.

35:15.807 --> 35:17.160
Come on.

35:17.367 --> 35:19.927
<i>- Rodney, come in.
- What’s happening ?</i>

35:20.127 --> 35:23.836
We’ve got Carson. Morrison and his team
are dead. We’re heading back.

35:24.607 --> 35:26.802
<i>We’re clear. Light it up.</i>

35:27.007 --> 35:28.645
Understood.

35:31.447 --> 35:33.358
Fail-safe detonation in...

35:33.567 --> 35:36.161
<i>... three, two...</i>

35:36.367 --> 35:38.005
... one.

35:40.847 --> 35:43.759
Now you see
what they really think of us.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.958
l don’t understand.

35:46.607 --> 35:49.519
The bomb is receiving
a detonation signal.

35:49.727 --> 35:52.195
If l hadn’t deactivated it...

35:52.647 --> 35:54.558
... we’d all be dead.

35:55.167 --> 35:57.044
Rodney ?

35:57.247 --> 35:59.238
<i>- l don’t understand it.
- What happened ?</i>

35:59.407 --> 36:02.604
<i>- You mean what didn’t happen.
-You telling me the bomb didn’t go off ?</i>

36:02.807 --> 36:03.956
They got to it.

36:04.167 --> 36:06.965
We cannot leave the Wraith here
to be found by the hive.

36:07.167 --> 36:10.796
Get back to work on those weapons,
Rodney. We’re not going anywhere.

36:20.887 --> 36:23.959
- Should we search for the prisoner ?
- There’s no point.

36:24.167 --> 36:27.079
He’s been taken up
to their ship by now.

36:27.847 --> 36:29.280
In any case...

36:30.167 --> 36:32.601
... he’s served his purpose.

36:34.687 --> 36:39.124
There’s nothing left for us to do but
wait for our brothers to rescue us soon.

37:02.447 --> 37:05.644
- How you doing with the weapons ?
- We couldn’t hit the side of a barn.

37:05.847 --> 37:09.920
- Hive ships are a hundred times--
- A giant flying barn, we couldn’t hit that.

37:10.127 --> 37:13.085
- What about a stationary target ?
- Motion in space is relative.

37:13.287 --> 37:16.404
- l’m talking about on the planet.
- Well, that l might be able to do.

37:17.607 --> 37:18.596
Target the camp.

37:18.927 --> 37:21.521
- Wait just a minute.
- We’ve had this discussion before.

37:21.687 --> 37:23.564
- There’s no choice.
- We could go down...

37:23.727 --> 37:25.843
- ... take as many as possible.
- We have no time.

37:26.007 --> 37:30.364
The other hive ship’s gonna be here,
we won’t survive a battle. It’s my call.

37:30.527 --> 37:33.599
There’s over 100 men down there
that believe we are their saviors.

37:33.767 --> 37:35.803
They’re about to become
casualties of war.

37:36.167 --> 37:37.919
It has to be done.

37:43.727 --> 37:45.365
Fire.

37:59.487 --> 38:01.876
It’s the other hive.
We’re taking multiple hits.

38:02.087 --> 38:03.406
- The target ?
- Hard to say...

38:03.607 --> 38:05.518
... how accurate our fire has been.

38:05.727 --> 38:08.799
Blanket the entire area.
We can’t afford a mistake.

38:09.287 --> 38:13.439
Engines are offline. We’re venting
atmosphere. Power’s about to fail.

38:26.847 --> 38:30.044
- Report.
- We’ve just about reached the planet.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.997
Drop us out of hyperspace.

38:50.647 --> 38:53.115
It’s debris from a hive ship, sir.

38:53.407 --> 38:56.319
- Life signs ?
- No, sir.

38:57.447 --> 38:58.596
What about the planet ?

38:59.167 --> 39:00.486
l’m not getting anything.

39:04.087 --> 39:05.725
l see.

39:06.127 --> 39:08.595
<i>Daedalus, this is Sheppard. Come in.</i>

39:09.487 --> 39:11.045
Sheppard, where the hell are you ?

39:14.287 --> 39:16.517
Oh, right, sorry.

39:20.927 --> 39:23.964
We’re picking up a Jumper, sir.
Five life signs.

39:24.127 --> 39:27.437
<i>You got here in good time, colonel.
We were looking at a long ride home.</i>

39:34.487 --> 39:38.162
You’re still not certain if any
of the Wraith on the planet survived ?

39:38.367 --> 39:40.085
Not certain, no.

39:40.287 --> 39:43.563
My people were concerned
about their own survival at that time.

39:43.767 --> 39:44.961
Understandably.

39:45.647 --> 39:49.162
But, of course, it’s my fault they were
in that position in the first place.

39:49.327 --> 39:53.366
If l had just disposed of those prisoners,
none of this would have happened.

39:54.127 --> 39:57.358
Isn’t that what you’re gonna write
in your report ?

39:58.247 --> 40:00.681
Quite the contrary, in fact.

40:00.887 --> 40:05.403
It was your decision to fire on the camp
from orbit that eliminated the threat--

40:05.607 --> 40:07.438
At least we hope it was eliminated.

40:07.647 --> 40:09.638
- -and allowed your team to escape.

40:11.087 --> 40:13.521
l didn’t make that decision.

40:14.047 --> 40:15.400
But you would have.

40:15.807 --> 40:19.686
If, hypothetically, Dr. McKay had
managed to get the hive subspace...

40:19.847 --> 40:22.919
... communicator working,
and you’d been apprised of the situation.

40:23.127 --> 40:24.685
Well, l...

40:25.207 --> 40:26.196
l might have.

40:26.367 --> 40:28.403
- Close enough.
- But that’s not what happened.

40:28.607 --> 40:30.518
The IOA doesn’t need to know that.

40:31.207 --> 40:34.882
In fact, they don’t wanna know that.

40:35.407 --> 40:39.195
In my business, sometimes it’s more
important not to let inconvenient facts...

40:39.407 --> 40:41.602
... get in the way of the greater truth.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.763
And the truth is...

40:43.967 --> 40:47.198
... you should remain here,
in charge of this expedition.

40:50.847 --> 40:52.565
For the moment.

40:55.967 --> 40:58.197
Dial Earth, please.
