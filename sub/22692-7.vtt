WEBVTT

00:58.120 --> 00:59.560
-Here we go.
-Hello!

00:59.600 --> 01:02.440
Greetings, everybody!
Thank you.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.440
-Thanks very much.
-Hello.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.640
JEREMY: Hello. Hello.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.280
-Hello, everybody.
-Hello.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.680
RICHARD:
Thank you. Thank you.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.480
-JEREMY: Loud!
-That's a big one.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.760
JEREMY: Thank you so much!

01:17.800 --> 01:22.240
Welcome. And in this edition
of the world's most exciting
motoring show...

01:23.720 --> 01:26.040
..a maroon Skoda...

01:26.080 --> 01:29.080
..a silver car
of some sort...

01:29.120 --> 01:32.800
..and an elderly German man
says, "I don't like jumps."

01:32.840 --> 01:34.360
I-I don't like jumps.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.640
-There's a lot.
-It's a good one. Good one.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.640
And there's that
diarrhoea-coloured Audi
as well, isn't there?

01:43.680 --> 01:45.240
Yeah. Yeah, there's that.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.440
-And you kill
a Chinese person.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.840
But we start with
Lamborghini.

01:50.880 --> 01:53.120
They've just launched
a more hard-core,

01:53.160 --> 01:55.720
more exciting version
of the Huracán,

01:55.760 --> 01:58.920
and Richard Hammond
was very keen to try it out.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.400
-I was.
-Yeah, he was.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.680
So we put the air ambulance
on standby...

02:03.840 --> 02:04.960
..and off he went.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.920
RICHARD: Here it is.

02:18.960 --> 02:22.200
It's called
the Huracán Performante.

02:22.240 --> 02:27.560
And whereas the standard
Huracán costs £155,000,

02:27.600 --> 02:32.240
this version comes in
at £208,000.

02:32.280 --> 02:35.680
So what do you get
for the extra £50,000?

02:45.520 --> 02:49.160
Well, to be honest, on paper,
not a lot.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.360
You only get
29 more horsepower,

02:51.400 --> 02:55.160
up from 602 to 631.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.640
And 30 more torques.

02:57.680 --> 02:58.560
Hm.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.160
So, while the original

03:03.200 --> 03:06.320
tops out
at 202 miles an hour,

03:06.360 --> 03:08.880
this can do, erm, the same.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.520
And the 0-60 time

03:12.560 --> 03:16.560
goes down by a whopping
two tenths of a second,

03:16.600 --> 03:20.680
from 3.1 to 2.9.

03:20.720 --> 03:24.160
Now, admittedly,
we are starting
from a very high baseline,

03:24.200 --> 03:28.640
and you have probably
just seen some pictures
of a car going very fast.

03:28.680 --> 03:32.640
But... 55 grand more?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.560
When do you start seeing
something for your money?

03:38.480 --> 03:42.480
Fortunately,
in quite a few places.

03:42.520 --> 03:46.280
For starters,
some proper work has gone
into making the Performante

03:46.320 --> 03:49.760
look more dramatic
than a normal Huracán.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.240
This car has much more of
the get-your-camera-phone-out
appeal

03:53.280 --> 03:55.280
you expect
from a Lamborghini.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.640
I particularly like
the material
this wing's made from.

04:01.680 --> 04:05.000
It's actually
chopped-up carbon fibre
bonded in a resin.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.920
So not only
does it look rather good,
it's also very light.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.400
And because they've
used it all over the place,

04:10.440 --> 04:13.440
they've shaved 40kg off
the weight of the car.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.000
And you would notice that
on a mountain road.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.400
And then we come
to the soundtrack.

04:22.440 --> 04:27.000
Again, if we compare it to
the standard car, the Huracán
makes an OK noise.

04:27.040 --> 04:30.600
But the Performante
comes with a new exhaust,
and that...

04:32.480 --> 04:33.680
Oh-ho!

04:35.320 --> 04:36.480
That is awesome, that is!

04:39.600 --> 04:41.360
Love the sound of a V10.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.480
Like having 10,000 wolves
at your back.

04:56.320 --> 05:01.360
But there's more
to the Performante than
just animalistic howling.

05:01.400 --> 05:06.000
The car is also equipped with
something called Aerodinamica
Lamborghini Attiva,

05:06.040 --> 05:07.720
or ALA for short.

05:07.760 --> 05:11.760
And what it claims to be
is a very clever
aerodynamic system.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.920
Basically, you have moving
flaps in the front spoiler,

05:16.960 --> 05:23.000
and moving air ducts
at the back that control
the airflow to the rear wing.

05:23.040 --> 05:27.160
Now, if you want to go fast
in a straight line, you need
less downforce,

05:27.200 --> 05:31.320
so the ducts open
so they direct more air
under the wing.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.200
Right, so,
fast in a straight line.

05:34.240 --> 05:37.640
That's as good an excuse
for a gratuitous drag race
as we've ever had.

05:39.240 --> 05:42.160
Just a shame there isn't
some local motorist

05:42.200 --> 05:45.840
out for a drive
in a Ferrari 458 Speciale,

05:45.880 --> 05:48.760
or... something...
something that...

05:48.800 --> 05:50.040
Oh, what a stroke of luck!

05:54.960 --> 05:57.040
-Morning.
-Fancy seeing you here.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.320
Yeah. To be honest,
I was just out for a drive

05:59.360 --> 06:01.400
and I stopped to sort of,
you know,

06:01.440 --> 06:03.840
marvel at the mystery
and wonder of God's creation.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.160
Yeah. Well,
I don't know if you're aware,

06:06.200 --> 06:09.840
but you happen to have
pulled up on the start line
of a drag race.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.120
-Yeah.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.320
RICHARD: Seeing as
our cars are so similar,

06:15.360 --> 06:18.920
would you mind
accompanying me to
the other end of this runway

06:18.960 --> 06:21.760
in a drag

06:21.800 --> 06:23.120
-Yeah, all right.
-Excellent.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.640
Good.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.360
It's just worked out
that way today.

06:27.400 --> 06:32.040
That's blind luck that
that man happened to be in...

06:32.080 --> 06:35.360
in... in the logical
competitor for this car.

06:58.880 --> 06:59.960
And we are away!

07:01.120 --> 07:04.080
Avanti!

07:04.120 --> 07:08.560
That aero now doing
its business to make this
thing as fast as possible...

07:08.600 --> 07:10.160
in a straight line.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.240
And, dear God!

07:16.880 --> 07:19.080
-Ha!
-Oh, no!

07:19.120 --> 07:24.560
I beat the local man
in his 458 Speciale,
by some considerable margin.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.760
But the Lambo's clever aero
system is equally impressive

07:31.800 --> 07:35.760
when you get
to the end of a straight
and arrive at a corner.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.240
Oh!

07:43.280 --> 07:46.000
As I go into a corner,
I need more downforce
to give me more grip.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.760
So the flaps and ducts are
adjusting to do just that.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.160
It's pressing down,
it's giving it grip.

08:04.640 --> 08:07.520
More than that, it can
operate individual sides

08:07.560 --> 08:12.480
so it can work individual
wheels mid-corner
to dial up the grip.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.440
That's clever.
Very, very clever.

08:20.440 --> 08:25.000
And let me give you some hard
evidence of just how clever.

08:25.040 --> 08:29.360
The Porsche 918, my favourite
out-of-this-world hypercar,

08:29.400 --> 08:33.200
went round the Nurburgring in
six minutes and 57 seconds.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.840
This thing,
five seconds quicker.

08:43.040 --> 08:48.960
As a driving machine,
the Performante
is one hell of an experience.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.200
But there's
even more to it than that.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.360
What Lamborghini
have done with this
is hit a real sweet spot.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.800
It can corner like a race car

08:57.840 --> 09:00.640
and shatter trees
with its engine noise,

09:00.680 --> 09:04.160
but it hasn't been turned
into some hard-core
track-day abomination.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.040
I've got air-con and Apple
connecty stuff in here.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.880
In the comfort sense,
it's very much like driving
a standard Huracán.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.920
And that last point is why
this car is so special.

09:17.960 --> 09:22.840
A lifetime ago, on a car show
in a galaxy far, far away,

09:22.880 --> 09:27.880
I reviewed the original
Huracán and was left
feeling a bit sad

09:27.920 --> 09:31.760
because it lacked that drama,
that thrill-delivery system

09:31.800 --> 09:34.560
that a Lamborghini
should have and be.

09:36.520 --> 09:39.680
Well, finally it's here.
The whole package
is complete.

09:39.720 --> 09:43.280
This is what the Huracán
should have been
from the start.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.040
It's brilliant.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.040
RICHARD: That was
a really... amazing thing.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.880
I don't see how Ferrari
always lose a race...

10:08.920 --> 10:12.200
when it's some punter's
car, and when they provide
the car, they win.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.440
RICHARD: Amazing, isn't it?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.280
I actually, erm...

10:15.320 --> 10:17.400
I drove a Performante
the other day,

10:17.440 --> 10:19.640
and I pulled out
to overtake a Peugeot,

10:19.680 --> 10:22.640
put my foot down,
and the noise was so enormous

10:22.680 --> 10:26.520
I genuinely believed the
engine had actually exploded.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.720
-I've never heard
a sound like it.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.400
It is pretty loud.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.120
But it's not pretty loud,
it's incredibly loud.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.520
It can't possibly pass any,
you know, regulations.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.200
-It doesn't need to be,
it's Italian.
-It is Italian, that's true.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.080
It's also...
It's also fantastic.

10:40.120 --> 10:43.000
I think I'm right in...
No, I know I'm right
in saying

10:43.040 --> 10:45.960
it's currently my favourite
supercar of the moment.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.200
Oh, it's definitely mine.
Supercar.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.920
Absolutely adorable,
it really is.

10:48.960 --> 10:53.560
Anyway, we must now find
how fast it goes round
the Eboladrome.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.520
-Come on, let's have it!

10:57.840 --> 10:59.480
JEREMY: And she's off!

10:59.520 --> 11:02.240
A searing start,
and a ferocious howl

11:02.280 --> 11:06.120
as the Huracán powers
onto the Isn't Straight.

11:06.160 --> 11:10.160
Grabbing at the gears to keep
that amazing V10 on song.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.120
And carrying some serious
speed through there.

11:13.160 --> 11:17.400
No let-up as she drives down
towards Your Name Here.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.280
Despite being
the hard-core model,

11:21.320 --> 11:24.760
the Performante
is still four-wheel-drive
like the standard Huracán.

11:24.800 --> 11:29.080
And that clearly translates
into serious mechanical grip.

11:29.120 --> 11:35.080
Now, unleashing all
631 horsepower for the blast
back down the Isn't.

11:35.120 --> 11:39.920
You really can't beat
a normally-aspirated engine
for sheer visceral wailing.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.960
It's superb.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.080
Old Lady's House.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.800
Grip, and that
active aero trickery
staving off understeer.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.960
On the bumpy run down
to Substation.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Is it going to be OK
through there?

11:53.040 --> 11:57.360
Yep, absolutely
no problem working
the carbon-ceramic brakes.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.760
Flies round Field of Sheep
and across the line!

12:01.560 --> 12:03.920
-That looked good.
That looked fast.
-It looks quick.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.800
-Yeah, that's it.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.680
-That was properly...
darting.
-It looked it.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.240
Anyway,

12:11.280 --> 12:13.280
we must now find out

12:13.320 --> 12:15.200
how far up the board

12:15.240 --> 12:16.680
the Huracán goes.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.600
RICHARD: Oh, hello.
Oh, hang on. Oh-ho!

12:19.640 --> 12:22.520
-JEREMY: Bloody hell.

12:22.560 --> 12:27.440
One sixteen-eight - that's
the fastest road-legal car
we've ever had round there.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.920
-It's not road-legal.
-It's Italian.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.200
-Same thing.
-Everything in Italian's
road-legal.

12:32.240 --> 12:36.560
Anyway, it is now time
for us to plant
some daffodils of opinion

12:36.600 --> 12:41.320
on the roundabout of chat
at the end of
Conversation Street.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.160
Sorry.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.560
-So sorry.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.080
That's the best thing
that's going to come
out of your mouth

12:56.120 --> 12:57.440
for the next seven minutes.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.040
Ouch!

13:00.080 --> 13:03.520
So erm, conversation,
sticking with supercars.

13:03.560 --> 13:07.440
Many new ones
have arrived recently,
and we have one here.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.360
If you have a look,
that is the Devel Sixteen.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.600
Now, that's a 12.3-litre
V16 quad-turbo engine.

13:14.640 --> 13:17.080
It's two Chevy engines
glued together.

13:17.120 --> 13:22.560
And it has a top speed,
according to the makers,
of 320 miles an hour.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.040
Really?

13:24.080 --> 13:25.600
-Three hundred and--
-That's what they say.

13:25.640 --> 13:26.840
You can test that one,
Hammond.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.200
-That's what they say.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.160
Anyway, if you don't fancy
the Devel Sixteen,

13:33.200 --> 13:37.800
you could try the
Ikeya Formula IF-02RDS,

13:37.840 --> 13:41.200
the Apollo Intensa Emozione,

13:41.240 --> 13:44.160
the er, Dallara Stradale,

13:44.200 --> 13:46.920
the er, Aspark Owl.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.880
What Owl?

13:48.920 --> 13:51.800
-The Aspark Owl, yes.
-You can't call a car an Owl.

13:51.840 --> 13:54.480
-JAMES: The Vencer Sarthe,

13:54.520 --> 13:56.640
the Arrinera Hussarya,

13:56.680 --> 13:59.600
the Mazzanti
Evantra Millecavalli,

13:59.640 --> 14:02.040
and the Hennessey Venom.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.520
No, I'm sorry, this is just
ridiculous. Seriously,
they're all new supercars?

14:04.560 --> 14:06.680
-They're all new supercars.
-That's absurd!

14:06.720 --> 14:08.720
-And then, from America...
-Oh, God!

14:08.760 --> 14:13.520
..there's the Glickenhaus
SCG 004S.

14:13.560 --> 14:17.080
And from Denmark,
the Zenvo TS1 GT.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.400
Right, we've got the idea.
Every single person in the
world has suddenly decided,

14:20.440 --> 14:22.400
"You know, I can make
a supercar myself."

14:22.440 --> 14:23.840
Yeah, it looks that way.
Yeah.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.800
The problem I've got
with all of this is

14:25.840 --> 14:27.720
it's not like we're
spoiled for choice already.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.680
I mean, you've got Ferrari,
Lamborghini,

14:29.720 --> 14:33.600
you've got Bugatti,
McLaren, Ford, even Audi.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.680
Yeah, but what if you want
a supercar with no heritage

14:36.720 --> 14:38.120
that's built
in someone's shed?

14:38.160 --> 14:40.120
If that's
what you really want.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.480
-And that you can't
get serviced anywhere.
-RICHARD: Exactly.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.400
Did any car there
appeal to anyone here?

14:47.600 --> 14:50.160
You'd all rather have
a Lamborghini Performante
than anything there?

14:50.200 --> 14:52.440
So that's total failure
for all those people.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.600
What you've just
looked at there
is 27 future bankruptcies.

14:57.480 --> 15:01.640
Now, we have always
argued that women,
whatever they say,

15:01.680 --> 15:06.440
are impressed when a man
performs a perfectly executed
handbrake turn.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.960
Oh, it's absolutely true.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.120
We've all been watching
Sir Attenborough's fish
programme, haven't we, yeah?

15:11.160 --> 15:13.200
Yeah, Blue Planet .
Unbelievable, OK?

15:13.240 --> 15:15.680
Now, the thing is, every
single week you see, OK,

15:15.720 --> 15:17.880
man fish comes along
with his lady fish there.

15:17.920 --> 15:22.040
Man fish can make his face
swell up - it's huge -
like a satellite dish.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.200
Lady fish: "I'm not bothered.
I'm not bothered."

15:24.240 --> 15:26.440
-But she is. She is.
-RICHARD: Yeah.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.840
And then she's going,
"I like his huge face,"

15:28.880 --> 15:32.480
and then they do sex,
or whatever it is fish do,
and then they have babies.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.920
Now, that massive face
that a fish can do,

15:34.960 --> 15:37.200
that's basically the same
as the handbrake turn.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.440
-All those birds
that dance about.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.720
We've got the handbrake,
birds can dance about.

15:41.760 --> 15:45.080
-It's all part of nature's
dance of love.
-Exactly.

15:45.120 --> 15:49.040
But the problem has been, of
course, most modern cars now
have electronic handbrakes.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.280
You can't do a handbrake turn
with one of those.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.000
That's why Tinder's
become so big.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.000
-Yeah, you have to...

15:55.040 --> 15:57.680
You have to swipe right
because you can't
slide left any more.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.240
-That's what's going on.
-Well, so that's been
the problem.

16:00.280 --> 16:03.080
With electronic handbrakes
we can't conduct
this mating ritual.

16:03.120 --> 16:06.920
Ford have noticed this,
given it some thought, and
they've come up with this.

16:06.960 --> 16:09.600
It's an after-market part
that you fit to your car.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.880
They call it the drift stick.

16:11.920 --> 16:14.400
-Oh, they ought to call it
the love handle.
-Yeah.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.040
But the point is, what it
does, it overrides the ABS,

16:18.080 --> 16:20.880
and you can actually
perform proper
handbrake turns in that.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.560
Girls are going to say,
if you pull that,

16:22.600 --> 16:24.280
"That was ridiculous
and you frightened me."

16:24.320 --> 16:26.360
-What they actually
mean is, "I'm hot."
-Yeah.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.760
-Come on. Yeah, admit it.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.280
-You're impressed by
a handbrake turn, aren't you?
-Just the thought of it.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.320
If you say no,
that's just part of it.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.560
I've never been
in a car with...

16:35.600 --> 16:37.880
You've never been in a car
with someone who's done
a handbrake turn?

16:37.920 --> 16:39.760
-Oh, hello!

16:39.800 --> 16:40.960
JEREMY: Ooh!

16:42.240 --> 16:44.080
Are you together?

16:44.120 --> 16:48.000
RICHARD: What are you doing,
man

16:48.040 --> 16:50.720
What is wrong with you?
How do you...?

16:54.720 --> 16:57.280
You drove here today,
huge fields everywhere.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.240
You didn't think,
"I'll give it some of that"?

16:59.280 --> 17:01.000
RICHARD: Get out there
and impress her.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.720
On the way out...
Just mind the sheep.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.880
Right, listen.
Bentley has announced

17:06.920 --> 17:09.640
a new version
of their big four-by-four,
the Bentayga, OK?

17:09.680 --> 17:11.960
Er... Which they say
is for shooting enthusiasts.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
We've got a picture here,
look. It's got this
kind of chest in the back

17:15.040 --> 17:18.240
which has, you know,
space for your guns
and refreshments, and so on.

17:18.280 --> 17:24.080
However, I know that whoever
designed that has never been
shooting in their lives.

17:24.120 --> 17:26.360
How do you know?

17:26.400 --> 17:28.880
Well, because if we examine
the refreshments that have
been photographed here,

17:28.920 --> 17:31.720
you will find that they
have fitted it with...

17:31.760 --> 17:34.840
rose lemonade
and elderflower juice.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.120
-Now, I'm sorry to say...

17:37.160 --> 17:40.520
No, I'm sorry to have to say
this, but has anyone here
been shooting ever?

17:42.280 --> 17:45.760
As you will know, a shooting
day is an armed drinks party.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.560
-There's no place
for shit like that.

17:48.600 --> 17:52.280
You turn up with elderflower
juice at a shoot
and the host will shoot you.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.640
-WOMAN: Middle East market.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.040
-Oh, she might have
a point with that.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.000
Could be.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.720
Don't come here with
your bloody sensible,
rational views.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.160
No, actually it's funny
you should mention
the Middle Eastern market,

18:05.200 --> 18:07.920
because they've also done one
for fly-fishing,
which happens in the Yemen.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.400
-Yeah.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.480
-JAMES: It does.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.680
JEREMY: And it gets better.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.360
And falconry.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.600
And falconry's really big
in the Middle East.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.200
What about dogging?

18:23.520 --> 18:26.320
-Well, why don't they do one
for dogging?

18:26.360 --> 18:31.040
It's a countryside pursuit,
and more people do that
than do falconry, don't they?

18:31.080 --> 18:34.080
-Well, yeah, you're prob...
probably right.
-Yeah.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.080
-From what I've heard.
-RICHARD: Well, they should.

18:36.120 --> 18:39.200
-But what would you have
in a dogging Bentayga, then?

18:39.240 --> 18:40.880
Well, you'd open the drawers
and there'd be like--

18:40.920 --> 18:42.800
-MAN: Wet wipes.
-Wet wipes!

18:42.840 --> 18:45.200
-Wet wipes. Good one.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.720
RICHARD: Straight away.
JEREMY: Yeah, wet wipes.
Good one.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.800
-Condoms.
-JEREMY: Yeah.

18:49.840 --> 18:53.080
Condoms. Maybe like a camera
and a whip, or something.

18:53.120 --> 18:58.120
No, on the... I reckon, on
the basis of Bentley thinking
that's a shooting, er, chest,

18:58.160 --> 19:00.640
that a Bentley
dogging Bentayga,

19:00.680 --> 19:04.520
they would literally have
a blanket, a bowl and a lead.

19:06.600 --> 19:10.520
Now, two US Navy aircrew
people have been in trouble,

19:10.560 --> 19:15.440
er... for using
the vapour trail from
the back of their fighter jet

19:15.480 --> 19:17.480
to paint pictures in the sky.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.160
We've got a shot
of their work here.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.120
JEREMY: Erm...
RICHARD: Oh, it's...

19:21.160 --> 19:23.320
That's good work. It's
very neat. It's neatly done.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.840
JEREMY:
It is neatly done. Now...

19:25.880 --> 19:29.960
Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker -
obviously from the US Navy -
he's not happy about this.

19:30.000 --> 19:36.080
He says, "Immature acts
of a sexual nature have
no place in naval aviation."

19:36.120 --> 19:39.600
Well, I'm sorry,
but the plane they were
flying when they did that

19:39.640 --> 19:42.160
is called the F-18 Growler.

19:45.640 --> 19:49.680
If the US Navy is going
to call its plane a Growler,

19:49.720 --> 19:51.160
they can't really complain

19:51.200 --> 19:52.840
when the pilots go and make

19:52.880 --> 19:55.360
pictures like that
in the sky, can they?

19:55.400 --> 19:58.720
No. And to be clear, if
you're American and you don't
know why we're laughing,

19:58.760 --> 20:02.480
it's the same as, erm,
US troops in Iraq laughed

20:02.520 --> 20:05.120
when British soldiers
were being transported around

20:05.160 --> 20:07.640
in what we call
a Snatch Land Rover.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.480
-RICHARD: It's the same joke.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.200
"Hey, you're in a Snatch!"

20:11.240 --> 20:13.400
"Yeah, and you're flying
around in a Growler,
so shut up."

20:13.440 --> 20:17.240
Anyway, if those
two US aircrew
do get fired and are bored,

20:17.280 --> 20:20.280
you are more than welcome
to come on this show anytime.
We'd love to see you.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.000
Yes, you are.
We like immature acts
of a sexual nature.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.560
-We do, yeah. Yeah.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.640
And that's it
for Conversation Street
this week.

20:27.680 --> 20:28.720
JAMES: Thank you.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.640
Thank you so much.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.600
Thank you.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.280
Now, there are many
unpleasant aspects
to modern motoring,

20:38.320 --> 20:42.880
such as Peugeots,
speed cameras,
drive-by shootings.

20:42.920 --> 20:47.360
But by far the worst of them,
we think, is having to stop
to fill up with fuel.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.680
No, it is.
It is the worst thing.

20:49.720 --> 20:52.440
It's particularly annoying
if the person at the pump
in front of you fills

20:52.480 --> 20:56.280
and then goes inside
to do a weekly shop
for a family of seven.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.880
Yes. Now, we did some
scientific research on this,

20:58.920 --> 21:01.600
and we discovered
that the average motorist

21:01.640 --> 21:05.960
spends 36 days of their life
filling up with fuel.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.920
And that got us thinking.

21:07.960 --> 21:11.240
What if you didn't have
to stop for petrol at all?

21:14.160 --> 21:19.000
JAMES: In order
to crack this problem,
we've come here...

21:19.040 --> 21:23.160
..to the Grand Tour special
high-intensity test track.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.800
And it's here
that we've come up
with our ingenious solution

21:28.840 --> 21:32.760
to ending the misery
of fuel stop fill-ups.

21:32.800 --> 21:33.680
Allow me.

21:37.240 --> 21:39.320
Yes, welcome, everybody,

21:39.360 --> 21:43.160
to the world's first
vehicle-to-vehicle
refuelling vehicle.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.280
To create
this incredible machine,

21:48.320 --> 21:54.560
we've taken our inspiration
from the world
of air-to-air refuelling.

21:54.600 --> 21:59.000
And it will, quite simply,
make petrol stations
obsolete.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.400
Now, the driver
sits up here as normal,

22:04.440 --> 22:07.080
but this is where
the fuel pump attendant -

22:07.120 --> 22:09.840
which in this case is me -
sits with all the controls,

22:09.880 --> 22:13.200
everything you need,
for a spot
of car-to-car refuelling.

22:13.240 --> 22:16.000
Absolutely. And we are so
pleased with our creation

22:16.040 --> 22:18.960
that we are going to let
the machine itself
do the talking

22:19.000 --> 22:23.880
with a real-world,
world-first, first ever...

22:23.920 --> 22:26.840
-Yeah, we got that.
-...inaugural demonstration.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.320
OK, so, here I am
on the motorway.

22:39.360 --> 22:41.160
Oh, no. I need petrol.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.600
And I make contact with
James's refuelling vehicle,

22:43.640 --> 22:45.600
probably via an app
or something.

22:45.640 --> 22:48.120
There's always an app.
We'll get a kid to do that.

22:50.280 --> 22:53.000
And there he is now.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.360
Here comes my first customer
now, down the motorway.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.440
I'm going to know it's him
who needs my services.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.440
There'll be an app
or something for that.

22:59.480 --> 23:03.120
I've got a range of fuels:
unleaded, super unleaded,
diesel.

23:03.160 --> 23:04.280
Here we go.

23:07.120 --> 23:11.480
Bringing down
the fuel-o-meter arm.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.160
Now, this tells
Richard Hammond how much
fuel he's taking on board

23:14.200 --> 23:18.480
and how much it's costing,
and just as importantly
it gives him a marker

23:18.520 --> 23:22.440
where to pull up
in relation to the van.

23:22.480 --> 23:26.640
It's all been
carefully calculated
using science... and stuff.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.800
JAMES: Pivoting. Pivoting.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.320
Coming in
to open filler flap.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.600
Already the heady fumes
of success are filling
my nostrils.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.960
Think about it. You're on
your way to that meeting.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.160
You're not stuck in a petrol
station queue - oh, no -
because you are a winner.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.120
You are going to make
that meeting.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.480
This is the key
to your success.

24:00.200 --> 24:03.480
JAMES: Sorry! Think of it
as a business opportunity.

24:03.520 --> 24:06.240
-Car-to-car
window replacement.
-Oh, brilliant!

24:08.760 --> 24:11.080
Hold steady.
Finger extending again.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.360
I've got it.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.720
Oh! Cocking Nora.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.680
Yeah, we're... nearly there.

24:25.720 --> 24:28.200
RICHARD: Having successfully
opened the filler flap,

24:28.240 --> 24:32.600
it was time for phase two:
unscrewing the fuel cap.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.120
Passengers would love this.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.240
Think of the kids.
I mean, they would
love watching this.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.200
JAMES: Fuel cap is removed.

24:44.240 --> 24:47.160
Extending fuel nozzle.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.320
I'll be as steady as I can.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.520
Back a little bit.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.200
Yeah, there it is!

25:04.760 --> 25:06.960
-We are pumping!

25:07.000 --> 25:11.280
Yeah, we are pumping gas!
Oh, yeah!

25:11.320 --> 25:12.360
It works!

25:14.640 --> 25:15.640
Oh, shit!

25:18.800 --> 25:21.200
What's happened?

25:21.240 --> 25:22.680
Hammond, right,
you're on fire!

25:23.840 --> 25:25.480
-Bail out!
-Oh, no.

25:29.760 --> 25:33.160
James, you bloody idiot!

25:33.200 --> 25:36.920
RICHARD: Clearly, this system
had a couple of issues.

25:36.960 --> 25:40.840
So we reconvened a few days
later with a new solution.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.520
OK, second time lucky.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.800
We think the problem with
the car-to-car refueller

25:49.840 --> 25:53.760
was there was a bit too much
tech, too much to go wrong.

25:53.800 --> 25:56.400
So we've scaled back
on that front.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.960
And there's James now.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.560
-Red light, on.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.080
Activating door release.

26:10.560 --> 26:14.840
Now, what we're using here
is Chinese acrobats
from the circus.

26:14.880 --> 26:18.320
Circuses get a lot
of downtime, so that's
a win-win all around.

26:18.360 --> 26:21.240
They are going to refuel
Hammond's car.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.440
-Watch this. Green light.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.080
He's on.

26:36.920 --> 26:40.680
I'm not stopped.
I just carry on.

26:40.720 --> 26:44.480
Look at that. It's like being
refuelled by Spider-Man.

26:44.520 --> 26:48.560
The genius of this is we've
made the petrol pump
attendant mobile,

26:48.600 --> 26:51.040
rather than
the petrol pump itself.

26:51.080 --> 26:54.280
It's much cheaper,
it's safer.

26:54.320 --> 26:57.480
Right, that chap's pretty
much exhausted his supply.

26:57.520 --> 27:01.720
-Time to send the second man.

27:01.760 --> 27:05.760
-OK, Hammond, pull up for
acrobat number two, please.
Right-o.

27:12.880 --> 27:13.800
Oh...

27:19.320 --> 27:23.560
RICHARD: Clearly,
there were also some
flaws in this method.

27:23.600 --> 27:27.120
So we went back
to the drawing board,
and a few days later...

27:32.760 --> 27:36.680
OK, we have had
a total grass-roots rethink.

27:36.720 --> 27:40.520
And, well, fingers crossed
for third time lucky.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.160
Check this out, viewers!

27:48.200 --> 27:52.240
What this is is one of those
specialist airport vehicles

27:52.280 --> 27:56.280
that normally goes around
doing, you know,
airporty-type stuff.

27:56.320 --> 28:01.440
But it also, as you can see,
makes a perfect platform
for a mobile fuel station.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.720
This really is genius.
This time.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.360
Here we go.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.120
Oh, yeah. Ramp's going down.

28:20.240 --> 28:23.000
Ready to commence docking.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.600
Right. I've never done this.
I don't know if it's going
to work. I'm hoping it does.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.840
I'm on!
I haven't been killed!

28:36.880 --> 28:39.680
There you go. You see,
no exploding acrobats,

28:39.720 --> 28:42.680
no cars having to keep
perfect station or anything.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.560
Hammond
can refuel at leisure.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.360
He can even have
a cup of coffee.

28:49.360 --> 28:52.680
So, that's it.
My car is refuelled and I
haven't stopped my journey.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.680
I'm still on my way.

28:54.720 --> 28:57.000
Thank you
for using Fuel Port.

28:57.040 --> 28:59.880
Please continue
to enjoy your journey.

29:01.520 --> 29:04.360
Ready for disembarkation.
Now, this is a bit tricky.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.040
This is precision stuff.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.960
Oh, God.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.040
It's a good job Hammond's
not the sort of person
who has accidents.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.320
OK, here I go.

29:25.080 --> 29:27.400
And we're off!

29:27.440 --> 29:28.880
It only works!

29:28.920 --> 29:29.880
Yes!

29:32.680 --> 29:36.440
We did something,
and we did it well!

29:36.480 --> 29:39.360
Motorists of the world,
you may have your lives back.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.240
-Very, very impressed.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.120
RICHARD:
Yep, saved the world.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.360
Oh, yeah.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.280
-Credit where it's due.
-It worked.

29:54.320 --> 29:57.720
And I have to say,
what staggers me

29:57.760 --> 29:59.880
is that
even without me helping -

29:59.920 --> 30:02.080
because I was in hospital
at the time -

30:02.120 --> 30:04.840
you managed to get
something that worked.

30:04.880 --> 30:07.880
No, it worked because
you were in hospital.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.560
-RICHARD: It's connected,
yeah.
-Whatever.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.360
You've gifted everybody here
another 36 days of life,

30:12.400 --> 30:14.800
and not even the Baby Jesus
could manage that.

30:14.840 --> 30:16.280
So well done, you.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.680
But we did
kill a Chinese man. Sorry.

30:18.720 --> 30:22.440
Yes, and I think we should
take a moment now
to remember his sacrifice.

30:35.320 --> 30:40.200
-Hammond, if you killed a
man, you can't be impatient.
-I'm sorry! I-I did it.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.800
-We'll gloss over it.
-It was a short sacrifice,
wasn't it?

30:42.840 --> 30:46.120
Anyway, listen, it's time now
for Celebrity Face Off!

30:59.880 --> 31:02.640
Once again,
we are asking a big question.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.520
And it's this:

31:05.560 --> 31:07.480
who is the fastest person
in the world

31:07.520 --> 31:11.640
who earns a living
from punching
and strangling other men?

31:11.680 --> 31:13.200
-To help us find out,

31:13.240 --> 31:16.640
please welcome Anthony Joshua
and Bill Goldberg!

31:23.480 --> 31:24.960
Bloody hell.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.920
They're getting nearer!

31:31.160 --> 31:33.520
I'm very well. Do...

31:33.560 --> 31:35.320
It's the land of the giants!

31:40.400 --> 31:43.600
-Ah, look at that!
-JEREMY: You can feel
the oestrogen, can't you?

31:43.640 --> 31:45.800
This...
It's like Loose Women .

31:47.840 --> 31:50.800
And for the first time
in my life I actually
feel like a midget.

31:50.840 --> 31:52.760
-Yeah.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.360
No, I mean, this guy, he's...
Well, you're... But he's...

31:55.400 --> 31:57.440
-Massive. He's a unit.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.560
-"A unit"! Thank you.
-He's a unit.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.200
Yeah, he is,
but you're, what, six...

32:01.240 --> 32:03.120
Six-six.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.000
Yeah, I think that's
just ridiculous, personally.
Erm...

32:05.040 --> 32:07.600
See, I've been hit
in the head with chairs
too many times.

32:07.640 --> 32:09.880
I used to be 6'6".
I'm only 6'3" now.

32:09.920 --> 32:13.680
The make-up girl was saying
she's never seen a head
with more scars on it.

32:13.720 --> 32:16.440
-I'll take that
as a compliment.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.480
I'm slightly out of my
comfort zone here, chaps,

32:18.520 --> 32:20.840
because boxing
and wrestling are not...

32:20.880 --> 32:22.480
I'm not really an expert
in either,

32:22.520 --> 32:25.600
so I hope you can guide me
through some of the things.

32:25.640 --> 32:29.560
-Er... You're obviously
the boxist. We do know that.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.560
One thing that really
interests me is you get hit,
obviously.

32:32.600 --> 32:35.960
-Yeah, yeah.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.280
Do you know what it is, what
I've learned? I was thinking
about this the other day.

32:39.320 --> 32:42.840
It's like, you know, as an
athlete you can look amazing,

32:42.880 --> 32:46.040
be in the best shape,
you can be the tallest,
the strongest.

32:46.080 --> 32:49.240
But it's when you start
getting hit you question, "Do
I really want to do this?"

32:49.280 --> 32:51.760
You've fought on with
a broken nose, though,
haven't you?

32:51.800 --> 32:54.800
Yeah, my last fight.
My last fight, strong guy.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.920
Erm... But it wasn't planned.
It's never happened before.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.920
-Well, I do.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.560
-Not what he does!
-Yeah.

33:01.600 --> 33:03.920
-"Can you break my nose
in the second round?"

33:03.960 --> 33:07.200
I thought the ref was going
to give me five minutes to
get myself together, but no.

33:07.240 --> 33:09.560
"You all right?" "Yeah."
"Carry on." And that was it.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.520
And if I don't carry on, then
I lose my titles and so on.

33:12.560 --> 33:15.280
You went on and won the fight
with a broken nose? Yeah.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.880
-Just say yes.
-Yes, I won. I battered him.

33:23.080 --> 33:25.680
JEREMY: Now, Bill...

33:25.720 --> 33:29.120
We had wrestling here - and
anyone in the audience who's
my age will remember it -

33:29.160 --> 33:32.520
and it was largely a sort of
fat woman called Shirley

33:32.560 --> 33:36.720
would sit on another man's
face, and the old women would
jump up and down and shout.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.880
-Hasn't changed a bit.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.480
Is it pre

33:40.520 --> 33:43.400
-It's predetermined.
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.640
-Well, I said that on. Hey...

33:45.680 --> 33:47.000
Hey, I said that on...

33:48.480 --> 33:51.160
I said that on Leno
20 years ago.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.160
ANTHONY: OK, OK.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.800
But, you know, I like to tell
people it's predetermined,
OK.

33:55.840 --> 33:59.480
You know who's going to win,
who's going to lose, how long
the match is supposed to be.

33:59.520 --> 34:03.400
But when I wrestled
The Giant, the Big Show...

34:03.440 --> 34:06.000
-Wow.
-...he weighed 525lb.

34:06.040 --> 34:08.160
And when I picked him
upside down,

34:08.200 --> 34:11.120
it didn't mean,
since it was predetermined,
that he was any lighter.

34:11.160 --> 34:13.240
-ANTHONY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.640
It didn't mean when he
picked me up and threw me
through the ground

34:15.680 --> 34:18.000
that it was going
to be softer.

34:18.040 --> 34:20.920
You know? You know
it's going to happen, but it
doesn't decrease the pain.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.120
So you can strangle people,
can't you?

34:23.160 --> 34:25.720
-You can do anything
you like in wrestling.
-Yeah, that's the best part.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.440
I can actually do that
in public, too,
and get away with it.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.560
-Not with you. You're my...

34:30.600 --> 34:32.680
You can only hit and bite.

34:32.720 --> 34:34.760
No, I can't bite.
Because Tyson bit,
I can't bite.

34:34.800 --> 34:38.200
Tyson bit.
He was a bitey person.
The Luis Suárez.

34:38.240 --> 34:40.560
He was an exception -
in a league of his own,
Mike Tyson.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.880
-BILL: He was an animal.
-He was an animal.

34:42.920 --> 34:46.080
Now, one of the things
that fascinates me about both
your disciplines of fighting

34:46.120 --> 34:49.040
is the amount you eat -
the calories you have
to bung in every day.

34:49.080 --> 34:50.720
When I got
the phone call last year

34:50.760 --> 34:53.480
to go back to wrestling for
the first time in 12 years,

34:53.520 --> 34:56.200
I had to cover
a lot of ground very quickly.

34:56.240 --> 34:59.360
So I had to eat
as much as humanly possible,

34:59.400 --> 35:01.680
um, and I had to train as
much as humanly possible.

35:01.720 --> 35:05.000
I'd eat 15,000-20,000
calories a day and I'd train
three times a day.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.760
I mean, that...
-Seriously, that's a lot.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.840
-I can't compete with that.
That's amazing.

35:10.880 --> 35:13.600
-That's dedication in itself.
-We got a request from
the girls in the office

35:13.640 --> 35:16.520
for photographs of you
without clothes on,
basically - there.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.240
I eat a lot,
but I don't look like that.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.720
I was explaining to the girls
in the office, though,

35:24.760 --> 35:27.400
that you've both got penises
like button mushrooms, so...

35:32.160 --> 35:34.120
I just... Really.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.840
Can we talk about cars?
This being a car show.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.720
-Yes.
-Please.

35:38.760 --> 35:41.720
Now you both started
with General Motors.

35:41.760 --> 35:45.080
You - I think we've got
a picture of it - with
a Pontiac Trans Am.

35:45.120 --> 35:47.760
-ANTHONY: Is that
what you started with?
-That's what he started with.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.880
And you started with
a General Motors car,
which was a Vauxhall Astra.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.720
-Nice!

35:53.760 --> 35:56.280
It's almost like
if somebody said,

35:56.320 --> 35:59.160
"What's the difference, then,
between America and Britain?
You speak the same language."

35:59.200 --> 36:02.640
-Well, there it is:
the Astra and the Trans Am.
-ANTHONY: There it is.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.560
Er... And you both
modified cars.

36:04.600 --> 36:07.040
-To a certain degree.
-To a certain degree.

36:07.080 --> 36:08.880
To an extreme degree.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.960
One of yours,
you put an 800-horsepower
NASCAR motor in.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.600
Anthony, you modified
your Astra because you put
a DVD player in it.

36:17.160 --> 36:19.320
-Which is slightly different.
-ANTHONY: Yeah!

36:19.360 --> 36:21.760
I told you.
-And then after that--

36:21.800 --> 36:25.040
All I can say is
if he beats me on the lap
I'm killing myself

36:25.080 --> 36:26.400
by jumping through
that window.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.360
Yeah.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.760
After that, you really
haven't got anything in
common with cars at all.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.960
I mean, it's just...
It's extraordinary.
It really is.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.480
Have either of you
ever crashed?

36:34.520 --> 36:36.600
-Oh, yes, absolutely.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.360
-Maybe, yeah.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.320
What's your best crash?

36:40.360 --> 36:42.760
There is an old story about -
since we drove
a Jaguar today...

36:42.800 --> 36:45.320
Erm... My brother
is a car collector,

36:45.360 --> 36:48.000
and he had a XK-E
that I just absolutely loved,

36:48.040 --> 36:50.680
but he wouldn't let me drive
the XK-E a lot.

36:50.720 --> 36:54.440
And... back in '85 when
Fort Lauderdale, Florida,

36:54.480 --> 36:56.960
was the place to go
for spring break,

36:57.000 --> 37:00.720
he leaves one night and says,
"Whatever you do, don't take
the Jag to Fort Lauderdale."

37:00.760 --> 37:05.120
Well... what do you think
I did, ladies and gentlemen?

37:05.160 --> 37:07.160
Fast forward a little bit,
we're looking
for a parking space,

37:07.200 --> 37:10.600
and the buddy in the backseat
proceeds to open the door

37:10.640 --> 37:12.920
to jump out
and find a parking space,

37:12.960 --> 37:15.280
and simultaneously
a motorcyclist came by

37:15.320 --> 37:18.440
and flipped over the door and
bent it backwards, and so...

37:18.480 --> 37:20.240
That serves them right
for being on a motorcycle.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.440
So, have you
ever crashed one?

37:23.480 --> 37:26.200
It's not as crazy as that.
Just me and my cousin.

37:26.240 --> 37:29.040
You know, I went and got
my little DVD player
from Wembley Market,

37:29.080 --> 37:30.800
if anyone knows there,
you know?

37:30.840 --> 37:34.080
A little £50 DVD player,
but it was...
it was life to me.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.760
So we bought the CDs
that you just...

37:35.800 --> 37:38.720
You can watch
your little hip-hop
music videos and stuff.

37:38.760 --> 37:40.920
So, we're cruising.

37:40.960 --> 37:44.320
And, mysteriously,
someone placed a car in front
of me at a traffic light.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.840
-So er...

37:46.880 --> 37:48.200
How did that happen?

37:48.240 --> 37:50.240
I've looked down
for a split second.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.480
-Yeah.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.640
Bang! Straight into the back.

37:54.680 --> 37:57.800
Yeah, but the DVD player
on the insurance form
wasn't on, was it?

37:57.840 --> 38:00.000
-It wasn't on. That was fine.
-No, it definitely wasn't on.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.320
But we lived
to tell the story.

38:02.360 --> 38:05.120
Now, I'm afraid,
we're going to park you,
Anthony, just for a second,

38:05.160 --> 38:08.960
because your collection
of cars now, Bill,
is simply unbelievable.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.680
-I mean, I've got the list.
-Let me see.

38:11.720 --> 38:14.760
We're not talking about...
You know, we're not talking
about Mini Metros here.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.120
I mean, we start back in '46
with a Willys Jeep,

38:18.160 --> 38:19.600
the Chevy Biscayne,
the Ford Thunderbird,

38:19.640 --> 38:23.000
Dodge 330, the Cobra Replica,

38:23.040 --> 38:25.920
Mercury truck, Plymouth GTX,
Plymouth GTX Convertible,

38:25.960 --> 38:28.600
Dodge Hemi Charger,
Chevy Blazer, GTO,

38:28.640 --> 38:30.880
Pontiac Trans Am
Pro Touring racing car,

38:30.920 --> 38:32.840
Dodge Ram, Cadillac Escalade,

38:32.880 --> 38:36.080
F250, Dodge Challenger
Hellcat, Charger Hellcat.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.960
Why haven't you got
any European cars,
which are vastly superior?

38:39.000 --> 38:42.160
-I do. There's
a Porsche 911 Turbo.
-Yes, there is, you're right.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.320
'92 Turbo. I've had
a couple of Ferraris.

38:44.360 --> 38:48.440
So you've got
a Volkswagen Beetle
and no other European cars?

38:48.480 --> 38:51.480
Bill, I think you're just
being racist, frankly, with
your choice of cars here,

38:51.520 --> 38:53.720
because
this is just so American.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.680
Right, we're going
to talk about your laps.

38:55.720 --> 38:58.840
-It's not easy.
It was fun, though.

38:58.880 --> 39:03.440
You say it's not easy. Would
anyone like to see a clip of
Anthony finding it not easy?

39:03.480 --> 39:05.080
AUDIENCE: Yes.

39:05.120 --> 39:07.760
OK, this is the last corner.
It's a 90

39:07.800 --> 39:10.440
-And here comes Anthony...
-Oh, great.
-...not making it look easy.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.440
JEREMY: That is a wide line
through there, Anthony.

39:19.480 --> 39:23.240
So you saw what I did and
tried to copy me, right? Ah!

39:23.280 --> 39:25.960
-Well, it's funny
you should say that.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.040
Because you know they say
everything is bigger and more
impressive

39:31.080 --> 39:32.920
when it's American
than if it's British?

39:32.960 --> 39:34.480
-Would you like--
-Play the clip!

39:34.520 --> 39:37.520
-JEREMY: Exactly.

39:37.560 --> 39:40.320
JEREMY: That is some
serious speed.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.480
Oh, no!

39:42.520 --> 39:44.360
-Yes!

39:47.640 --> 39:51.000
JEREMY: That is, erm...

39:51.040 --> 39:53.560
-If you're going to screw up,
screw up big time.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.520
It's interesting that
both of you went off on that.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.680
Nobody's had trouble with
that corner before.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.080
I don't believe you.
-No. Then both of you.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.120
It's that, "I'm going to..."

40:01.160 --> 40:04.320
Yeah, it was the last corner
to make up time
for all our screw-ups.

40:04.360 --> 40:07.760
I'm trying to work out whose
lap we're going to see first.
Let's start off with...

40:07.800 --> 40:10.880
-Let's see Bill's. Let's have
a look at Bill's lap.
-BILL: Eurgh!

40:10.920 --> 40:13.600
Anthony Joshua,
you're next, mother.

40:18.800 --> 40:22.840
JEREMY: And there he goes!
He is underway.

40:22.880 --> 40:25.040
Looking good. Oh,
cutting the corner nicely.

40:25.080 --> 40:27.640
Now, you should slow
through here a little bit.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.640
BILL: First time I've ever
been on the right-hand side.
JEREMY: The correct side.

40:30.680 --> 40:34.160
And now, as we go onto
the gravel, starts to get
very loose here.

40:34.200 --> 40:37.720
BILL: First time I've ever
been on the gravel, also.
JEREMY: Yeah. Yeah.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.920
That's actually
very tightly done.

40:39.960 --> 40:42.680
I drive like a
old lady around here.

40:44.880 --> 40:46.800
JEREMY: Oh, actually,
that is not particularly
quick through there.

40:46.840 --> 40:49.520
I was told you were
very fast on the Tarmac,

40:49.560 --> 40:51.600
but not brilliantly quick
on the gravel.

40:51.640 --> 40:54.520
-Well, I could have
told you that!

40:54.560 --> 40:58.200
JEREMY: Now it gets
really slippery when you
rejoin the Tarmac.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.520
That is an amazing line
through there.

41:00.560 --> 41:02.960
-It's actually probably
quite sensible.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.600
JEREMY: No, that's a good
idea, because you get more
speed into that corner.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.320
Now we're on the straight.

41:07.360 --> 41:10.600
Let's see if I've got
some balls and stay in this.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.760
JEREMY: Oh, that's quick.
Are we quick...

41:12.800 --> 41:15.000
That does look flat
through there.

41:15.040 --> 41:18.360
And now coming up
to the tricky last corner.
Well, tricky for you two.

41:18.400 --> 41:22.160
And... Yeah, there he is. And
across the line, everybody!

41:22.200 --> 41:24.240
-They were nice moves.

41:24.280 --> 41:25.640
Nice moves.

41:29.080 --> 41:32.160
-Who'd like to see
Anthony's lap?

41:32.200 --> 41:33.560
Let's have a look.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.400
BILL: Was there any
ice out there?
JEREMY: Like that sound.

41:39.440 --> 41:41.920
Come on! Give me some power.

41:41.960 --> 41:44.920
JEREMY: They've all
been dry pretty much so far.
You see, that's--

41:44.960 --> 41:47.920
ANTHONY: It looks nice
and smooth round there.
JEREMY: With you driving.

41:47.960 --> 41:50.120
ANTHONY:
You're going fast
round there.

41:50.160 --> 41:53.320
JEREMY:
Right, now, we're about
to head onto the gravel.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.760
Now, you see, you pick up
speed here all of a sudden,

41:55.800 --> 41:57.840
for no reason
that anyone can understand.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.080
Exuberant through there.

41:59.120 --> 42:02.080
Oh! No, don't do this! Yes!

42:04.680 --> 42:06.800
JEREMY: You look like
you're enjoying yourself.
BILL: That's what matters!

42:06.840 --> 42:09.320
JEREMY: Yeah,
and he's enjoying himself
through there as well.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.800
Kicking the tail out
to go into Difficult Bit Two.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.400
And again! God,
this is impressive stuff.

42:14.440 --> 42:17.200
Car's looking very tidy,
got to be honest.

42:17.240 --> 42:18.680
And now...

42:18.720 --> 42:20.280
Yep.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.720
Tighter line. No,
a tighter line through there.

42:22.760 --> 42:25.000
Now on the left, and then
we're back on the straight.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.640
And it's supposed
to be flat all the way
to the last corner.

42:27.680 --> 42:31.320
Now let's go!

42:31.360 --> 42:33.800
JEREMY: Looking quick.
Looking very... Oh, my God!

42:33.840 --> 42:36.600
That was leaning on it.
That was leaning on it there.

42:36.640 --> 42:39.480
And now we're coming up
to the last corner.

42:39.520 --> 42:43.280
Yes. And there we are,
everyone. He's made it, too.

42:49.080 --> 42:50.560
That's brilliant.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.160
Right, I have the times.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.400
-Act like you don't care.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.760
-I'm in anticipation.
-Bill Goldberg...

43:00.480 --> 43:01.600
One...

43:02.760 --> 43:03.640
..twenty...

43:05.040 --> 43:06.840
..point-four.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.520
So that's... Yeah.
No, that's worthy
of a round of applause.

43:09.560 --> 43:11.760
-It's not the fastest
we've ever seen.

43:11.800 --> 43:13.040
One minute, 20.4.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.080
Good. Good time.
That's a good time.

43:17.120 --> 43:19.480
Good thing about you two
is you're not competitive.

43:21.320 --> 43:23.720
Anthony Joshua: One...

43:25.200 --> 43:27.480
..eighteen-point-seven.

43:29.560 --> 43:30.880
BILL: Good time, yeah!

43:33.000 --> 43:34.840
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

43:34.880 --> 43:40.160
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bill Goldberg and -
I better read this out -

43:40.200 --> 43:42.520
the world's fastest person
who makes a living

43:42.560 --> 43:45.600
by punching or strangling
other men, Anthony Joshua!

43:47.400 --> 43:49.040
BILL: Way to go, man!
ANTHONY: Thank you.

43:49.080 --> 43:52.000
Way to go.

43:52.040 --> 43:56.160
Right, now,
over the years there have
been many titanic battles

43:56.200 --> 43:58.600
in the world of motorsport -
many great duels.

43:58.640 --> 44:01.400
You've had Hunt versus Lauda,

44:01.440 --> 44:03.080
you've had Prost
versus Senna,

44:03.120 --> 44:06.640
you've had the Ford GT40
versus the Ferraris
at Le Mans.

44:06.680 --> 44:10.400
But my favourite battle
of them all is this one.

44:21.800 --> 44:24.760
JEREMY: Back in 1977...

44:24.800 --> 44:28.880
Audi was developing
this four-wheel-drive vehicle
for the German military,

44:28.920 --> 44:30.920
when they had
a bit of a thought.

44:32.640 --> 44:35.200
They wondered if its
four-wheel-drive system

44:35.240 --> 44:38.840
could be made to work
in an ordinary family car.

44:42.200 --> 44:47.440
And so, under the cover
of darkness at a quarry in
a remote corner of Germany,

44:47.480 --> 44:51.640
they began secret tests.

44:51.680 --> 44:55.240
And straight away
it was obvious that with
all four wheels being driven,

44:55.280 --> 45:00.480
the family car had an
enormous amount of grip.

45:00.520 --> 45:06.000
This meant it could go around
corners on loose surfaces
like that much faster.

45:07.160 --> 45:09.200
And that, they reckoned,

45:09.240 --> 45:10.600
would make it
good at rallying.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.920
But there was a problem.

45:17.960 --> 45:22.520
What I've got here is the
1979 Motor Racing Rule Book.

45:22.560 --> 45:25.360
It's the most boring book
in the world, but whatever.

45:25.400 --> 45:27.160
Here on page eight million,

45:27.200 --> 45:30.080
article two says
that in rallying

45:30.120 --> 45:34.120
"Four-wheel-drive cars...
will not be admitted."

45:36.400 --> 45:38.680
Audi, however,
had thought about that,

45:38.720 --> 45:42.880
and dispatched a man to Paris
to a meeting
of the sport's governing body

45:42.920 --> 45:45.680
to try and get the rule
changed.

45:47.400 --> 45:48.920
He was very clever,

45:48.960 --> 45:50.520
because he waited for
the meeting to be finished -

45:50.560 --> 45:52.680
everyone pulling on
their hats and coats -

45:52.720 --> 45:55.720
and then he went, "Oh, God.
Sorry, one more thing. Erm...

45:55.760 --> 45:59.280
This rule about, erm,
four-wheel-drive being banned
in rallying,

45:59.320 --> 46:01.960
is it OK if we, er...
we get rid of that?"

46:02.000 --> 46:04.080
And everyone said, "Well,
obviously he wants to enter

46:04.120 --> 46:06.360
his silly little army lorry
in something or other,"

46:06.400 --> 46:10.440
so they all went, "Yes, yes.
Whatever," and went home.

46:10.480 --> 46:14.280
Three years later,
this is what happened.

46:18.840 --> 46:21.400
COMMENTATOR:
The four-wheel-drive Quattro
is all-conquering,

46:21.440 --> 46:24.720
and the Audi has been proved
master of all conditions.

46:24.760 --> 46:26.480
Superior power and traction

46:26.520 --> 46:29.800
with the turbo-charged,
four-wheel-drive Audi
is too much.

46:29.840 --> 46:31.640
Bjorn Waldegard
has wasted no time

46:31.680 --> 46:34.760
in proving the dominance of
the four-wheel-drive Quattro.

46:34.800 --> 46:37.000
Hannu Mikkola has scored
a tremendous victory.

46:39.200 --> 46:44.000
COMMENTATOR: The Quattros
hold all the aces:
first, second and third.

46:44.040 --> 46:48.880
Audi won the World
Championship in 1982
with this very car, actually.

46:48.920 --> 46:51.040
And from that moment on,

46:51.080 --> 46:55.160
everyone knew that to win
in rallying you had to have
four-wheel-drive.

46:55.200 --> 46:58.480
Well, when I say everyone...

47:08.360 --> 47:11.320
This was Lancia's answer
to the Quattro:

47:11.360 --> 47:14.360
the two-wheel-drive 037.

47:21.200 --> 47:24.600
I've got a bit of a soft spot
for all old Lancias,

47:24.640 --> 47:27.960
but in this... it's not soft.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.520
This is everything
I was expecting it to be.

47:46.560 --> 47:50.040
-Pops, bangs, lumpy petrol.

47:50.080 --> 47:54.920
A dashboard dominated
by this enormous
and very well used ashtray.

47:56.600 --> 47:58.440
Completely Italian.

48:01.360 --> 48:06.520
Honestly, it is dainty
as a dandelion seed
caught in a summer breeze...

48:08.360 --> 48:12.160
..and as agile
as a water boatman.
I mean, that was...

48:12.200 --> 48:15.920
That was just
glorious through there.

48:15.960 --> 48:17.120
Glorious!

48:20.640 --> 48:24.560
It feels highly strung.
Feels like a thoroughbred.

48:25.880 --> 48:27.840
It's fast as well.

48:29.400 --> 48:32.120
Oh, wow!
What a thing this is.

48:34.640 --> 48:37.240
On a dry track, then,
or in a beauty contest,

48:37.280 --> 48:41.840
the 037 would thrash the
Quattro any day of the week.

48:41.880 --> 48:44.320
But in the rough-and-tumble,

48:44.360 --> 48:50.280
crash-bang-wallop world
of rallying, not a chance.

48:50.320 --> 48:55.280
What's more, Audi was
backed by the industrial
might of Volkswagen.

48:55.320 --> 48:57.800
It was efficient
and organised.

48:57.840 --> 49:01.320
This was the team boss,
Roland Gumpert.

49:01.360 --> 49:06.000
Look at him!
A hands-on, bearded German
doctor of engineering.

49:08.960 --> 49:12.440
Lancia's team boss,
meanwhile, well,
he was a bit different.

49:15.360 --> 49:17.640
His name was Cesare Fiorio,

49:17.680 --> 49:20.800
and he liked girls
and power-boat racing.

49:20.840 --> 49:24.360
Also, he was running
a team staffed by Italians,

49:24.400 --> 49:26.080
on a shoestring.

49:26.120 --> 49:29.800
And then there were
the drivers.

49:29.840 --> 49:34.520
Audi had Hannu Mikkola,
and Stig Blomqvist,
and Michèle Mouton...

49:36.560 --> 49:39.640
..who had won 21 rallies
between them.

49:39.680 --> 49:42.720
Quattro was the car
on everybody's lips,

49:42.760 --> 49:45.240
you know, in rally business.

49:45.280 --> 49:47.840
And, of course,
we were developing the car
all the time.

49:47.880 --> 49:50.200
It was getting better
and better.

49:50.240 --> 49:53.240
We were well funded,
you know?

49:53.280 --> 49:55.640
And er, that time
it was a big team.

49:58.080 --> 50:01.280
JEREMY: Lancia, meanwhile,
had Markku Alén
and Walter Rohrl,

50:01.320 --> 50:05.440
who was brilliant,
but said he didn't want
to compete in every event,

50:05.480 --> 50:08.920
and didn't want to be
world champion.

50:08.960 --> 50:15.800
I told them, "Listen,
I want to win Monte Carlo."

50:15.840 --> 50:18.600
I like Corsica,
I like Acropolis,

50:18.640 --> 50:23.240
I like New Zealand,
I like er, San Remo.

50:23.280 --> 50:28.440
I only do these five or six
beautiful rallies,
and nothing more.

50:28.480 --> 50:32.680
I am not interested
to win any more
the World Championship title.

50:32.720 --> 50:35.880
I want to be a normal man,
not something special.

50:35.920 --> 50:40.280
And if we are always
in the newspaper
and everywhere,

50:40.320 --> 50:42.600
of course you're never...
you're never alone,

50:42.640 --> 50:46.120
because people standing
in front of your house,
and... and I don't like.

50:48.080 --> 50:52.160
So, Audi had
four-wheel-drive,
a proven car,

50:52.200 --> 50:55.840
a team staffed by Germans,
a hands-on boss,

50:55.880 --> 51:01.280
and a squad
of world-class drivers
who were motivated and on it.

51:01.320 --> 51:05.080
Lancia, meanwhile,
had a budget of £3.75,

51:05.120 --> 51:08.440
two-wheel-drive,
a power-boating playboy
at their helm,

51:08.480 --> 51:12.840
and a part-time driver
who didn't want to be
world champion.

51:15.840 --> 51:17.200
However, Lancia did have

51:17.240 --> 51:19.640
one ace up its sleeve.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.760
They'd been
in rallying for ages.

51:21.800 --> 51:24.040
They'd won the championship
four times,

51:24.080 --> 51:25.720
with cars like the Fulvia

51:25.760 --> 51:27.960
and then the Stratos.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.840
So although their
power-boating team boss

51:29.880 --> 51:31.720
looked like a playboy,

51:31.760 --> 51:35.360
he knew all the tricks.

51:35.400 --> 51:39.440
For example, the rules said
that before you could enter
a car in a rally,

51:39.480 --> 51:42.400
you had to build
at least 400 examples

51:42.440 --> 51:45.440
which could be sold
as road cars to customers.

51:48.560 --> 51:52.480
Now, obviously, when
officials from the sport's
governing body turn up

51:52.520 --> 51:58.200
to check you've done that,
they are going to notice
if you've only made 200.

52:01.640 --> 52:03.560
So you say, "Yes, mm.

52:03.600 --> 52:06.800
But, you see,
this car park was full,

52:06.840 --> 52:11.800
so the other 200
are in a car park
on the other side of town."

52:11.840 --> 52:14.480
And then you say, "Let's go
and count those now,

52:14.520 --> 52:20.760
and on the way,
why don't we stop off
for a spot of lunch?"

52:20.800 --> 52:25.040
You then make sure the lunch
goes on for a very long time.

52:25.080 --> 52:27.760
You have a starter,
a main course...

52:27.800 --> 52:30.520
So I turned it
into candles for three days,
got it into port.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.600
..pudding, cheese...

52:32.640 --> 52:35.440
Well, when I say "reverse,"
careered backwards.

52:35.480 --> 52:37.720
..mints, more cheese...

52:37.760 --> 52:41.040
Shame to waste the bottle.

52:41.080 --> 52:43.800
And then, afterwards, you
take them to another car park

52:43.840 --> 52:48.320
which contains, miraculously,
the other 200 cars.

52:50.480 --> 52:54.160
Then you had
the cars themselves.

52:54.200 --> 52:57.960
The rules say they must
be fitted with roll cages.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.920
But roll cages are heavy,
they'll slow you down.

53:00.960 --> 53:04.160
So why not use something
like this instead?
It looks like a roll cage.

53:04.200 --> 53:08.080
It would pass
a visual inspection
every day of the week.

53:08.120 --> 53:12.000
But, actually, it's made...
from cardboard. Look.

53:16.440 --> 53:20.000
I'm not saying
Lancia actually did that.

53:20.040 --> 53:22.760
But if you examine
these crashed 037s,

53:22.800 --> 53:26.280
you can see they weren't
exactly... strong.

53:29.320 --> 53:33.840
My family and my friends
around me said, "Listen.

53:33.880 --> 53:37.280
Why are you signed
for Lancia? This car
is so dangerous.

53:37.320 --> 53:41.360
If you see these thin tubes
and these plastic things,

53:41.400 --> 53:46.120
if you... if you went off,
then it's maybe the last
accident you have."

53:46.160 --> 53:51.160
And I answer,
"Listen, I am not planning
to have an accident."

53:51.200 --> 53:55.160
JEREMY: However,
despite Lancia's experience
and Cesare's cunning,

53:55.200 --> 54:00.560
no-one expected them
to do well in the first round
of the 1983 Championship,

54:00.600 --> 54:04.640
which was held
in the freezing mountains
above Monte Carlo.

54:07.480 --> 54:12.640
We were very much afraid
about this rally, because
you can find a lot of snow,

54:12.680 --> 54:15.640
ice, er, slippery conditions,

54:15.680 --> 54:20.880
where,
of course, a mid-engine car
with rear-wheel traction

54:20.920 --> 54:24.040
is not the... the best idea.

54:24.080 --> 54:28.160
JEREMY: So,
whilst Audi prepared for the
event by fettling its cars,

54:28.200 --> 54:31.520
Lancia got ready by going
to the supermarket.

54:33.720 --> 54:37.000
Here they bought
all the salt they could
lay their hands on.

54:39.800 --> 54:42.480
They then sprinkled this
on the difficult corners

54:42.520 --> 54:46.480
so that by the time their car
came along the ice was gone.

54:49.800 --> 54:52.080
And they weren't
finished there.

54:52.120 --> 54:58.000
We have been also pushing
local authorities, taking
care of the French roads.

54:58.040 --> 55:00.480
Say, "Oh, there's a lot
of ice on that road.

55:00.520 --> 55:04.240
It's very dangerous for
spectators and for the
drivers with all this ice."

55:04.280 --> 55:05.680
"Oh, oh, oh, yes."

55:05.720 --> 55:08.000
And so they went and they...

55:08.040 --> 55:12.080
and they cleaned up
the... the roads,
and that was fantastic.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.360
JEREMY: They also had another
trick up their sleeve.

55:18.400 --> 55:22.960
After the icy stages were
over, the Lancia stopped
in the middle of the stage,

55:23.000 --> 55:25.760
so the winter tyres
could be changed.

55:27.880 --> 55:30.520
Now, there was nothing
in the rules that said
you could do this.

55:30.560 --> 55:34.160
But critically...
there was nothing
that said you couldn't.

55:36.520 --> 55:39.080
If you want to compete in
motorsport, you must know
the rules you have to face.

55:40.240 --> 55:43.000
The grey zones of the rules.

55:43.040 --> 55:49.600
And it's always a big fight,
but er... you must try
to be a bit clever.

55:49.640 --> 55:51.400
JEREMY: The result
in Monte Carlo, then,

55:51.440 --> 55:55.440
was the exact opposite
of what everyone
had been expecting.

55:55.480 --> 55:59.520
COMMENTATOR: Four-wheel-drive
and 340 turbo-charged
horsepower

55:59.560 --> 56:00.880
are just not enough.

56:00.920 --> 56:03.840
It's Audi sadness,
Lancia joy.

56:03.880 --> 56:08.200
JEREMY: The two-wheel-drive
Lancias, on a rally famed
for its slippery conditions,

56:08.240 --> 56:10.720
finished first and second.

56:14.800 --> 56:18.760
For the next event
of the year, in Sweden,

56:18.800 --> 56:22.840
there wasn't enough salt
in the world

56:22.880 --> 56:25.040
to get rid of all
the snow and ice.

56:25.080 --> 56:27.840
So Lancia
solved the problem...

56:29.520 --> 56:31.160
..by simply
not turning up at all.

56:35.160 --> 56:38.760
Audi therefore scored
a one-two here.

56:38.800 --> 56:43.720
And three weeks later
they did the same thing again
in Portugal.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.840
And after more successes
in East Africa,

56:47.880 --> 56:50.480
it looked like Audi
were running away with it.

56:52.560 --> 56:55.320
But then the whole circus
moved to Corsica,

56:55.360 --> 57:00.120
where almost all
of the stages are held
on dry, smooth Tarmac.

57:00.160 --> 57:03.320
Everyone expected the nimble
two-wheel-drive Lancias

57:03.360 --> 57:06.280
to pick up
a load of points here.

57:06.320 --> 57:10.640
But nobody could have
predicted how many
they were going to pick up.

57:13.560 --> 57:17.280
Usually, Lancia
turned up at an event
with two or three cars,

57:17.320 --> 57:20.280
but here
they arrived with four.

57:20.320 --> 57:23.320
Which meant that
if they ran faultlessly,
which they did,

57:23.360 --> 57:26.680
the best Audi
could hope for was fifth.

57:26.720 --> 57:29.240
And thanks
to mechanical failures...

57:29.280 --> 57:30.520
they didn't even get that.

57:35.840 --> 57:39.040
With our speed,
it's just like holiday.

57:39.080 --> 57:42.600
So, Lancia, with its salt
and its tyre-changing antics,

57:42.640 --> 57:46.520
and its... flexible approach
to how many cars
were in the team,

57:46.560 --> 57:49.520
was back on top
of the leader board.

57:49.560 --> 57:52.480
But then the whole circus
moved to the roughest

57:52.520 --> 57:55.480
and toughest event
on the European calendar.

57:57.280 --> 58:00.400
Greece.

58:00.440 --> 58:04.800
Here, everyone knew
the rough roads would
cause mechanical issues.

58:04.840 --> 58:07.840
There would be breakdowns,
and there were.

58:07.880 --> 58:10.440
But amazingly,
they were all Audis.

58:14.320 --> 58:16.640
COMMENTATOR: For Lancia,
it's an impressive victory.

58:16.680 --> 58:18.760
Rohrl has again
driven superbly.

58:20.640 --> 58:23.680
And I won Acropolis
in a... in a Lancia.

58:23.720 --> 58:27.160
Er... It was a result
I never expected,

58:27.200 --> 58:29.760
that we even
can come to the finish,

58:29.800 --> 58:32.760
because I was thinking,
"Maybe the Lancia
is too light

58:32.800 --> 58:35.440
to stay in one piece for...
for Greece."

58:37.280 --> 58:39.440
JEREMY: The year wore on
with both teams

58:39.480 --> 58:42.360
always in contention
for the championship.

58:45.040 --> 58:49.880
But then it was time for
everyone to head for
the bumpy hell of Finland,

58:49.920 --> 58:51.800
and Lancia had a problem:

58:51.840 --> 58:54.160
Walter Rohrl refused to go.

58:55.840 --> 58:57.920
I didn't like
to go to Finland,

58:57.960 --> 59:01.840
because I...
I don't like jumps.

59:01.880 --> 59:06.760
Because, you know, if I want
to fly, I would be a pilot.

59:06.800 --> 59:09.120
But not sitting in a car.
That's no way.

59:20.720 --> 59:24.480
JEREMY: Because of his
no-show, Audi won, easily.

59:29.600 --> 59:33.720
However, with only three
rounds left, it was
mathematically possible

59:33.760 --> 59:37.080
for Lancia to win the World
Championship in San Remo.

59:39.760 --> 59:42.080
And that's something
they really wanted to do,

59:42.120 --> 59:45.280
because San Remo...
well, that's Italy.

59:45.320 --> 59:48.960
They'd be winning it
in front of their home crowd.

59:49.000 --> 59:53.280
To do that, they'd have
to deal with the main feature
of the San Remo Rally.

59:54.520 --> 59:56.920
Dust.

59:56.960 --> 1:00:00.120
It's thrown up by a car,
and a minute later when
the next one comes along,

1:00:00.160 --> 1:00:01.840
it's still there.

1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:06.560
Which makes seeing where
you're going a bit tricky.

1:00:06.600 --> 1:00:08.600
To try and make
everything better,

1:00:08.640 --> 1:00:11.760
they fitted a team van
with brushes
and sent it up the course.

1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:15.280
But this didn't really work,

1:00:15.320 --> 1:00:18.880
so the drivers came up
with a cunning alternative.

1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:25.600
On one stage, a minute after
the German car had set off

1:00:25.640 --> 1:00:28.400
and the Lancia
was supposed to go...

1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:29.880
it didn't move.

1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:35.720
So the starter went over
to see what was wrong.

1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:37.520
I'm really sorry.
My belt, it's...

1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:39.760
I don't know how it's
happened. It's come undone.

1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:43.240
I know I should... I should
have done this before
we came to the start line.

1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:46.280
It's my bad, really. Oh,
now they've all come undone!

1:00:46.320 --> 1:00:48.880
I feel like such an idiot.
I just need to...

1:00:48.920 --> 1:00:53.520
By the time the problem
had been solved, the dust,
luckily, had all gone.

1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:54.920
Right, we're good to go now.

1:00:56.280 --> 1:01:00.640
Oh, no! The door!
Oh, there it is.

1:01:00.680 --> 1:01:04.480
Annoyingly, the officials
quickly put a stop to this
Boss Hoggery.

1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:09.760
So if Lancia was going
to win here on gravel,

1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:14.000
it would all be down
to the skill of the driver.

1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:19.120
And, boy, did Walter Rohrl
rise to the occasion.

1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:22.880
Looking back in my career,
it was maybe my best rally
in my life I have done.

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:26.320
It was just like...
like a dream.

1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:29.320
I mean, I was just thinking,

1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:31.720
"I want to...
to cut this corner.

1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:35.120
Don't lose 10cm of road."

1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:38.240
The car was going
exactly on this point,

1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:40.200
and it was flowing.

1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:41.680
It was just...

1:01:43.840 --> 1:01:46.000
"Nobody can beat me."

1:01:46.040 --> 1:01:50.880
And then there was
the magnificent 037 itself.

1:01:50.920 --> 1:01:54.320
ROHRL: Driving a Lancia,
it's a perfect thing,

1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:58.120
because it... it doing
exactly what you want.

1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:01.280
It's like my...
like my... my shoe.

1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:04.680
It fits so perfectly.

1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:08.320
If I just think it should
do this one, it has done it.

1:02:11.520 --> 1:02:14.760
JEREMY: With man and machine
in such perfect harmony,

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:18.920
Rohrl won a staggering
33 of the 58 stages.

1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:22.480
The team scored
a one-two-three,
and as a result,

1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:24.240
they won
the World Championship.

1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:31.040
David had beaten
the four-wheel-drive Goliath.

1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:34.920
And no two-wheel-drive car...
would ever do that again.

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.480
Yeah, I do, definitely.
I want one.

1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:00.440
Great story.
A really good story.

1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:02.880
Yeah, it is. What?

1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:05.840
I'm just wondering,
though. Did...

1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:09.520
Did a Lancia driver win
the Drivers' World
Championship that year?

1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:12.200
-No, because Walter Rohrl
didn't want to.
-No, the other bloke.

1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:15.360
Markku Alén? Mathematically,
he could have won
the Drivers' Championship.

1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:19.960
But after they won the
Constructors' Championship
in San Remo there,

1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.800
Lancia then,
they didn't bother going
to the last two events.

1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:25.040
They just didn't go,
so he couldn't win.

1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:27.960
That must be pretty
frustrating if you're
a professional racing driver.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.480
It would be the same as
Mercedes' Formula 1 Team

1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:32.960
winning the Constructors'
Championship last year
in Texas,

1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.040
then saying,
"We're not going to go
to the last three races.

1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:37.360
Got Lewis Hamilton going,
"But I can't..."

1:03:37.400 --> 1:03:39.040
"I'm sorry, we've won,
and that's all
we're bothered about."

1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:41.240
-But I tell you
what makes me sad...
-JEREMY: Mm.

1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:44.160
..is the way that Lancia
has pretty much vanished
these days.

1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:47.560
Oh, I know.
Audi is now enormous,
and Lancia's shrivelled up

1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:51.200
to the point where it only
makes one pretty terrible
car, if we're honest,

1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:53.240
and it only sells it
in Italy.

1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:55.560
It is, it's heartbreaking.
And on that terrible
disappointment -

1:03:55.600 --> 1:03:58.400
and for once it really is
a terrible disappointment -
it's time to end.

1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:00.320
Thank you so much
for watching. Goodbye.
