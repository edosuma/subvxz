02:14.426 --> 02:17.137
That's right. Move it along.
Come on. Gather 'em up.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.921
Hurry up now.

03:01.807 --> 03:05.686
"Give thanks to God, for he is good…

03:07.855 --> 03:10.274
His love endures forever."

03:13.360 --> 03:17.447
"The Lord is with me.
I will not be afraid…

03:19.867 --> 03:21.702
What can a mere man do to me?"

03:25.122 --> 03:26.373
"The Lord is my helper…

03:29.001 --> 03:31.920
I will look in triumph at my enemies."

03:35.090 --> 03:36.383
"The Lord is with me…

03:38.886 --> 03:40.053
He is my strength…

03:42.931 --> 03:43.849
and my defense…

03:46.518 --> 03:49.062
He has become my salvation."

04:03.994 --> 04:05.370
"The Lord is God."

04:06.997 --> 04:09.708
"He will shine upon those
who trust in him."

04:17.298 --> 04:19.384
You are the last drop of water…

04:20.844 --> 04:23.180
…in my mouth.

04:30.062 --> 04:35.943
You are the sun
that warms me in the morning.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.616
No.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.703
Come on, boy. Let's go.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.128
Peter.

04:56.547 --> 04:57.965
Stay together.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.633
I said now, boy.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.844
Do not touch me. I will walk.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.971
-What the hell?
-Boy, you'll get-- Come on.

05:04.054 --> 05:04.972
Get out of there.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.265
Papa!

05:07.224 --> 05:08.350
Get back, boy!

05:09.017 --> 05:12.688
-Come on. Damn it, let go.
-Help! Come on!

05:16.942 --> 05:18.026
Get here, boy.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.657
Peter!

05:23.740 --> 05:25.325
Hey. Get back.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.330
Damn animal bit me!

05:30.831 --> 05:32.082
Hey!

05:32.165 --> 05:34.001
-No!
-Papa.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.545
-That's enough.
-No!

05:36.628 --> 05:38.714
Captain Lyons. Please, sir.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.054
I will walk.

05:55.022 --> 05:58.025
Please don't fight.

05:59.443 --> 06:02.196
-Peter!
-No!

06:03.197 --> 06:04.198
Come on.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.618
Oh, Peter.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.662
Got him in.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.790
-Move over.
-You get back to work. All of you.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.418
All right now. Get on with your work.

06:28.138 --> 06:32.518
You tell General Beall, should he
impress any more of my property,

06:34.102 --> 06:36.480
I will take it up with
Jefferson Davis himself.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.026
Gonna ruin my business, this taxation.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.238
The nigger's my best blacksmith.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.995
Papa, come back!

06:52.079 --> 06:55.707
Stay together.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.918
Papa!

06:58.001 --> 06:59.336
-Scipion!
-Get back here, boy.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.381
-Papa!
-Get back! Get back here.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.758
-Scipion!
-I will come back to you!

07:04.842 --> 07:06.176
Papa!

07:07.886 --> 07:10.389
-Papa!
-I will come back to you!

07:10.472 --> 07:13.809
-Check your boy. Control him.
-Papa!

08:50.239 --> 08:53.242
Go back to your work!

09:57.222 --> 09:59.975
Keep it moving. Move.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.000
Everybody out!

10:29.379 --> 10:32.174
Eyes down.

10:48.190 --> 10:53.487
Man said, "Eyes down."
Down. Keep 'em there.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.574
Come on now, don't slack. You hear?

10:57.658 --> 10:59.535
-Move!
-Move.

11:00.244 --> 11:01.703
Get away from him.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.834
Get away from him, I said.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.050
That's right, keep it spinning.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.301
Get it all out.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.220
Let's go! Keep moving!

11:18.303 --> 11:19.429
Hurry up.

11:19.513 --> 11:23.767
Eyes down, boy. Come on. Go!

11:25.727 --> 11:27.354
Don't make me yell again.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.231
We got a runner.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.358
Come on.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.280
Come on! Get to work!

11:36.363 --> 11:40.242
The Bible says,
"Slaves, be obedient to your masters.

11:41.243 --> 11:46.081
Not with eye-service or men-pleasers,
but as the servants of Christ,

11:46.164 --> 11:47.916
doing the will of God.

11:49.376 --> 11:54.423
Though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I shall fear no evil"

11:55.549 --> 12:00.387
"for thou art with me;
thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."

12:04.975 --> 12:06.977
Good dog. Get that scent.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.480
What the hell are you doing?

12:10.564 --> 12:12.524
You stop when I say stop.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.029
You, get him outta here.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.949
Inside! All you!

12:22.326 --> 12:23.702
Keep moving, nigger.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.787
Let's go, y'all.

12:32.711 --> 12:33.962
Let's go.

12:38.509 --> 12:41.887
I wanna see full scoops.
I wanna see a full shovelful.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.765
The railroad ain't gonna build itself.

12:46.225 --> 12:48.060
What's the matter?

12:48.143 --> 12:52.397
Big ape like you can't carry it?
Come on, boy.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.820
Move, boy. Move!

13:01.865 --> 13:03.408
What are you doing, boy?

13:03.492 --> 13:04.660
This man needs help.

13:05.577 --> 13:06.912
You hard of hearing?

13:10.624 --> 13:13.293
I say when someone needs help.

13:27.140 --> 13:31.019
Come on now. Get about it.
Get back to work over there.

13:31.103 --> 13:32.813
You a cold one, ain't ya?

13:37.526 --> 13:38.694
Easy. Come on.

13:38.777 --> 13:39.945
Where'd you catch him?

13:42.072 --> 13:43.448
Get up, goddamn it.

13:43.532 --> 13:47.744
No. Easy.

13:52.958 --> 13:53.959
Thank you.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.807
See there, that Black man?

14:52.100 --> 14:56.396
He was sold with me in Opelousas,
ran away.

15:00.609 --> 15:03.362
Looks like he works for Jim Fassel now.

15:04.655 --> 15:09.284
Biggest man hunter around these parts.
Hunts day and night.

15:20.337 --> 15:21.964
That's it. Get him down.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.924
Wounded coming in.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.218
All right. Here we go.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.637
Get him to a nurse if he can't…

15:28.720 --> 15:30.347
Make some room for you guys…

15:33.016 --> 15:34.226
This one too.

15:36.562 --> 15:39.064
Right through here.
You can chain him on the floor.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.776
Medical said they'd take him.

16:36.830 --> 16:37.998
What do they call you?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.211
Tomas.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.342
Do you have a family, Tomas?

16:51.553 --> 16:52.554
A wife?

16:55.974 --> 16:57.768
Someone to think about?

17:01.605 --> 17:02.689
A mama?

17:05.983 --> 17:07.319
Then remember…

17:09.988 --> 17:12.281
This is just work.

17:13.534 --> 17:17.746
Same as you always done. Just work.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.626
God is with us.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.174
How can you say that to him?

17:31.301 --> 17:33.136
"God is with us."

17:36.807 --> 17:39.351
Where is he?

17:43.105 --> 17:45.399
And why has he not set you free?

17:48.569 --> 17:49.987
Or has he?

17:52.239 --> 17:56.201
So you are not in these?

17:58.829 --> 17:59.872
Well, then stand up…

18:02.040 --> 18:04.418
Stand up. Go. Stand up.

18:04.501 --> 18:08.881
Stand up, and praise your God
for all he has done for you,

18:08.964 --> 18:10.966
for all of us.

18:19.975 --> 18:20.976
You.

18:23.562 --> 18:25.397
God is not with you.

18:26.815 --> 18:27.983
He is nowhere.

18:30.986 --> 18:35.032
And he sends that fool
to tell us about his word.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.577
To be a good slave.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.539
To be obedient to your masters.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.589
Is that what God says to you?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.635
God says many things…

18:56.803 --> 18:58.180
I do not know why…

19:00.140 --> 19:06.813
God shows himself to some people
and not to others…

19:10.275 --> 19:12.361
But if you do not know him…

19:20.577 --> 19:21.787
I will pray for you.

19:26.875 --> 19:30.170
Matthew 17:20 says
that you can move a mountain.

19:30.921 --> 19:34.049
But faith without work is dead. Faith!

19:34.550 --> 19:36.718
It's okay to work and die for your master.

19:37.511 --> 19:42.766
-Faith is obedience. Be obedient.
-Come on down. Hold it.

19:43.976 --> 19:45.811
Bring it down. All right. Yeah.

19:45.894 --> 19:49.523
-Faith. Give unto the Lord…
-All right. Keep moving.

19:50.065 --> 19:51.608
There we go. Up.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.945
…Give unto the Lord the glory…

19:55.028 --> 19:58.115
Look alive. Okay. All right.

20:05.539 --> 20:08.458
Steady yourself. Long day out here.

20:11.420 --> 20:12.546
Water break!

20:18.385 --> 20:19.928
Not you.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.101
Not you.

20:27.895 --> 20:29.438
Book of Timothy teaches us,

20:30.898 --> 20:36.570
"All who's under the yoke of slavery
should consider their masters worthy,

20:37.446 --> 20:38.989
worthy of respect."

20:39.072 --> 20:41.408
You, you. Water.

20:42.910 --> 20:44.536
Book of Timothy teaches us,

20:45.204 --> 20:50.626
"All who's under the yoke of slavery,
should consider your master worthy,

20:52.002 --> 20:53.962
worthy of respect"

20:56.423 --> 20:57.424
Worthy.

21:00.344 --> 21:01.470
Worthy.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.973
Clear!

21:05.057 --> 21:07.684
Clear! Let's go! Let's move! Move!

21:12.856 --> 21:13.982
Back to work.

21:21.573 --> 21:24.535
"And God has revealed his very will to me.

21:26.245 --> 21:29.081
And so, I issue Proclamation 95."

21:30.582 --> 21:31.792
What the hell's that mean?

21:32.292 --> 21:33.836
Lincoln freed the slaves.

21:34.336 --> 21:35.420
What?

21:37.339 --> 21:39.174
Lincoln freed the slaves.

21:40.676 --> 21:43.178
Get on, boy.
Fetch us a couple tins of water.

21:47.766 --> 21:48.934
Desperate man, Lincoln.

21:49.685 --> 21:53.063
You know, according to one of these other
papers from a couple weeks back,

21:53.146 --> 21:56.024
slaves are running to Baton Rouge
from every direction

21:56.108 --> 21:57.526
now that Grant holds the town.

21:58.777 --> 22:01.405
Fixing for liberty. One and all.

22:05.409 --> 22:06.493
Matter with you?

22:10.497 --> 22:12.291
Nigger put something in my stew.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.170
And the damn corn pone's rotted out!

22:17.129 --> 22:20.090
Damn you, son of a bitch.
You put something in my stew, nigger?

22:22.926 --> 22:25.804
What y'all looking at? Get back to work.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.850
What you put in my stew?

22:32.269 --> 22:37.733
What, now you gonna eyeball me again, boy?
Get over here!

22:45.490 --> 22:47.367
You gone crazy from the heat, boy?

22:50.037 --> 22:51.330
He is just a child.

23:06.428 --> 23:09.181
Boy must have a death wish.

23:14.228 --> 23:15.229
What?

23:23.028 --> 23:24.112
Back to work.

23:25.239 --> 23:26.240
Go!

24:09.950 --> 24:11.118
I'm your God.

24:20.252 --> 24:22.421
You walk the Earth because I let you.

24:25.424 --> 24:26.758
You're my dog now.

24:30.721 --> 24:36.101
Perhaps you will give me some of that
fine meat you give your other dog.

24:45.485 --> 24:46.987
You're funny now, big stick.

24:49.156 --> 24:50.157
You'll see.

25:12.804 --> 25:13.847
Come on. Hurry up.

25:15.224 --> 25:16.225
Go! Let's go!

25:16.308 --> 25:19.478
One, two, three, four! One!

25:19.561 --> 25:20.979
Hey, keep moving.

25:21.772 --> 25:24.274
-One, two, three, four!
-He's a dead man.

25:27.903 --> 25:28.987
No.

25:31.156 --> 25:32.574
You miss your family?

25:35.619 --> 25:39.289
The dog's got your scent. So do I.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.718
Yeah, well, move it now.

25:52.928 --> 25:55.013
-I heard it myself.
-Back it up!

25:55.514 --> 25:56.932
Slaves are free.

25:58.433 --> 25:59.476
Free?

26:02.980 --> 26:03.981
Says who?

26:04.898 --> 26:09.570
Lincoln. We must get to Baton Rouge.
Lincoln's army is there.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.950
It's true. I heard it also.

26:17.035 --> 26:18.912
Bring it up! Let's go.

26:18.996 --> 26:21.999
So, where is Baton Rouge?

26:23.750 --> 26:25.460
Five days through the swamp.

26:27.421 --> 26:30.340
There are many ways to die in a swamp.

26:30.424 --> 26:32.384
There are many ways to die here.

26:33.927 --> 26:36.180
If you go, I'll follow.

27:47.668 --> 27:51.046
Hey. Get it outta here.

28:05.727 --> 28:06.728
Get it outta here.

28:08.856 --> 28:09.857
Up the pit.

28:12.025 --> 28:13.026
Go!

29:00.657 --> 29:01.992
Get it in.

29:21.553 --> 29:26.183
Should get that lime in there,
you cowards! Whole damn camp stinks.

29:26.266 --> 29:27.643
The hell we will.

29:28.352 --> 29:31.063
Not when there's a perfectly good nigger
to do it.

29:38.695 --> 29:42.783
You gonna hang, damn deserter.

29:44.743 --> 29:46.995
Here. Dig.

29:51.708 --> 29:52.876
Get that lime in there.

30:26.660 --> 30:27.953
Damn you, nigger.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.960
Whoever bemoans the master's will…

30:47.472 --> 30:49.391
Runner!

30:51.602 --> 30:52.978
We've got a runner!

31:10.037 --> 31:11.455
Let's go! Run!

31:28.514 --> 31:29.515
Deserter!

31:40.317 --> 31:42.152
They're going for the swamp!

31:44.905 --> 31:45.906
We got work.

33:37.184 --> 33:38.560
Swamp. This way.

35:24.750 --> 35:26.376
Tomas. Come, Tomas.

36:04.957 --> 36:06.708
Come on.

36:12.089 --> 36:13.423
Get out of there.

36:19.346 --> 36:20.347
Enough!

36:21.348 --> 36:22.683
Where are we going?

36:23.851 --> 36:25.102
Do you know where you're going,

36:25.185 --> 36:27.563
-or are you just running?
-Damn it.

36:32.693 --> 36:36.780
I take you back to that camp,
they're gonna grind you up like meat.

36:37.281 --> 36:41.368
You tell me where your friends
are heading, though… and I'll let you go.

36:45.372 --> 36:47.082
You ain't worth chasing.

36:52.337 --> 36:54.339
-Swamp.
-Swamp's everywhere.

36:56.049 --> 36:59.845
Which direction? North? East?

37:04.558 --> 37:08.312
Had an idea to get to Lincoln's army.

37:09.313 --> 37:10.981
Down Baton Rouge, southwest.

37:12.524 --> 37:13.984
All right. Go on, then.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.321
Go on.

37:19.448 --> 37:20.449
Go on, then.

37:22.701 --> 37:24.453
Give my regards to old Abe.

37:41.094 --> 37:43.805
Look here, boss. We got a runner.

37:58.946 --> 38:01.782
See a nigger with an idea,
best put him underground.

38:04.159 --> 38:05.285
Split up.

38:18.173 --> 38:19.174
Which way?

38:20.467 --> 38:21.468
Swamp.

38:21.969 --> 38:23.637
Horse trail. It's faster.

38:23.720 --> 38:25.180
No, too dangerous.

38:25.848 --> 38:26.849
I have a gun.

38:26.932 --> 38:28.767
-They have more.
-I am going.

38:28.851 --> 38:30.769
-Do not.
-You are not my master.

38:37.192 --> 38:39.862
He is too brave. I follow you.

38:40.863 --> 38:44.408
No, we must go our own way.

38:45.534 --> 38:46.702
Harder to track.

38:48.537 --> 38:49.580
You abandon me?

38:50.747 --> 38:51.748
Never.

38:52.457 --> 38:53.667
Go through the swamp.

38:54.585 --> 38:56.962
Follow the sound of Lincoln's cannons.

38:58.797 --> 38:59.798
Go.

40:15.082 --> 40:16.458
Go on, take the horse trail.

40:59.376 --> 41:00.627
…we understand

41:22.649 --> 41:24.526
Come, let us bow our heads…

41:50.052 --> 41:52.346
The Father, the Son

41:52.429 --> 41:53.805
and the Holy Spirit.

41:55.307 --> 41:56.767
Bless us, oh, Lord.

41:56.850 --> 41:57.809
It is thy gifts,

41:58.435 --> 42:00.103
which we are about to receive

42:00.187 --> 42:01.688
from thy bounty.

42:01.772 --> 42:03.815
Through Christ, our Lord.

42:04.900 --> 42:05.901
Amen.

42:06.485 --> 42:08.403
Runner!

42:10.239 --> 42:11.573
Runner!

42:12.324 --> 42:13.659
Runner!

42:17.329 --> 42:19.206
Runner!

42:19.790 --> 42:21.166
Runner!

42:21.750 --> 42:24.419
Runner!

42:38.517 --> 42:39.518
Runner!

42:41.228 --> 42:42.604
Runner!

42:42.688 --> 42:44.523
It went that way, towards the swamp.

44:00.849 --> 44:02.893
These guys are not letting him out.

44:57.406 --> 44:59.032
That's a clever son bitch.

45:01.076 --> 45:02.870
Looks like he went through that swamp.

47:01.697 --> 47:04.324
Mama, you all right?

47:07.160 --> 47:08.203
Saw your papa.

47:10.706 --> 47:11.915
You think he's alive?

47:14.084 --> 47:15.169
I know it.

47:18.422 --> 47:19.965
What if he don't come back?

47:21.425 --> 47:23.260
Your papa is going to be back.

47:25.012 --> 47:27.264
Do not ever stop believing that.

47:28.724 --> 47:29.725
Hey?

47:37.191 --> 47:38.692
Your papa is going to be back.

47:40.027 --> 47:43.322
Do not ever stop believing that.

47:45.199 --> 47:49.077
I've seen your papa survive things
most men can't.

47:49.995 --> 47:55.000
When we came here,
they insisted that we change.

47:55.918 --> 47:58.003
Change our names…

47:58.921 --> 48:00.714
…our language.

48:02.049 --> 48:05.177
They even tried to change who we are.

48:08.597 --> 48:11.725
Your papa taught us to hold on.

48:14.186 --> 48:17.648
Now it is our turn to do the same for him.

48:19.650 --> 48:20.651
Hold on.

48:23.111 --> 48:26.114
Hold on to each other.

48:27.824 --> 48:28.992
Hold on.

48:29.493 --> 48:30.494
Hey?

48:31.078 --> 48:32.621
Hold on.

48:35.249 --> 48:36.750
Come.

50:02.669 --> 50:04.087
Papa!

50:40.749 --> 50:42.584
Look like he knew
right where to do him, too.

50:43.836 --> 50:46.171
Ain't no way that boy
got away from this thing.

50:53.178 --> 50:54.179
Open her up.

51:19.288 --> 51:20.455
Ain't nothin' in him.

51:36.722 --> 51:39.433
Yeah. Look at that.

51:40.225 --> 51:42.102
Our boy fixed a gator.

51:53.030 --> 51:56.575
How in the hell does an ignorant nigger
got knowledge like that?

51:56.658 --> 51:58.827
You're the ignorant one
thinking like that.

52:02.831 --> 52:05.626
My father was a corn husker…

52:07.920 --> 52:10.589
My mother passed when I was young, so…

52:12.508 --> 52:16.261
the job of raising me
fell on our nigger house girl.

52:16.762 --> 52:18.138
She took care of me.

52:19.473 --> 52:24.728
She fed me. She washed me.
She taught me things…

52:26.688 --> 52:27.773
She was my friend.

52:32.986 --> 52:34.071
One evening…

52:37.282 --> 52:41.787
I asked my father
if she could join us for supper,

52:44.623 --> 52:48.043
and he looked at me in a funny way
and said, "Then what?"

52:49.127 --> 52:54.258
I said, "So we could eat together,"
to which he asked, "Then what?"

52:57.845 --> 53:01.640
I didn't know, I was just a boy.
But he did.

53:04.393 --> 53:05.394
He said…

53:11.233 --> 53:12.734
"First, they eat our food,

53:14.152 --> 53:18.240
then they'll take our jobs
and then they'll steal our land.

53:20.200 --> 53:21.952
We give the nigger so much as a crumb,

53:22.035 --> 53:24.329
they're going to take over
the whole damn country."

53:28.959 --> 53:30.878
I was so ashamed. I…

53:33.297 --> 53:38.051
I told him I'd been sneaking her food
when she was hungry.

53:41.847 --> 53:43.223
He got real quiet…

53:44.975 --> 53:50.272
Called her into the dining room,
picked up a dinner knife and…

53:52.524 --> 53:53.650
fixed her right there.

53:56.653 --> 53:58.155
Left her in the field to rot.

53:59.781 --> 54:01.325
Took her three days to die.

54:02.117 --> 54:06.205
Last thing she said was, "Why?"

54:10.167 --> 54:12.920
Hopped a train to St. Louis,
made my way down to Mississippi,

54:13.003 --> 54:15.047
found myself in this here swamp.

54:18.175 --> 54:19.218
And know what I saw?

54:22.179 --> 54:25.891
I saw niggers, just like her…

54:26.934 --> 54:32.189
running, hiding… surviving.

54:34.358 --> 54:37.903
People make 'em out to be ignorant,
but far from it.

54:40.322 --> 54:46.411
In fact, what's worse
is they tend to be persistent.

54:48.956 --> 54:49.957
See, one gets free…

54:51.333 --> 54:57.506
then another.

54:58.131 --> 55:02.469
And someday,
they may return the favor on us.

55:05.722 --> 55:06.807
Can you imagine?

57:05.926 --> 57:09.638
The Lord is my salvation.

57:12.933 --> 57:14.059
He is salvation.

57:24.111 --> 57:25.279
Peter.

58:17.247 --> 58:19.166
I shall fear no enemy.

58:21.210 --> 58:22.836
I shall fear no enemy.

58:51.907 --> 58:53.408
Boy must be dead by now.

58:55.077 --> 58:56.078
Find him.

1:05:26.301 --> 1:05:27.553
Mssr. Hurley?

1:05:31.348 --> 1:05:33.016
Everything good, sir?

1:05:36.436 --> 1:05:37.479
Morning after next,

1:05:37.563 --> 1:05:43.527
man named Mr. Fabian gonna cart in up
from Atchafalaya, way of Simmesport.

1:05:43.610 --> 1:05:44.653
Yes, sir.

1:05:47.656 --> 1:05:50.701
You come around the barn,
go off with him when he leaves.

1:05:53.787 --> 1:05:57.708
-Sir?
-Captain Lyons sold you.

1:06:00.377 --> 1:06:01.545
There a problem?

1:06:04.923 --> 1:06:08.385
Have I displeased Captain Lyons?

1:06:08.468 --> 1:06:10.012
Not that I'm aware of.

1:06:13.724 --> 1:06:17.102
Betsy sure has gotten big, hasn't she?

1:06:18.729 --> 1:06:20.898
She's almost as tall as you are now.

1:06:26.069 --> 1:06:27.237
Betsy.

1:06:34.369 --> 1:06:38.790
Then my children and I look forward
to serving Mr. Fabian.

1:06:38.874 --> 1:06:40.209
Yeah, children ain't going.

1:06:43.962 --> 1:06:45.255
Sir?

1:06:45.339 --> 1:06:48.300
Well, Mr. Fabian said
he has you a new husband,

1:06:49.259 --> 1:06:51.303
now that yours has been put to war.

1:06:56.767 --> 1:06:59.478
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

1:07:02.856 --> 1:07:03.982
We clear?

1:07:05.943 --> 1:07:07.236
Please, sir.

1:07:07.319 --> 1:07:09.988
I said, are we clear?

1:07:13.325 --> 1:07:14.493
Yes, sir.

1:07:16.995 --> 1:07:17.996
Good.

1:07:20.249 --> 1:07:21.667
Now go on, get back to work.

1:07:28.423 --> 1:07:29.424
Mama?

1:07:34.054 --> 1:07:35.055
Scipion.

1:07:37.140 --> 1:07:38.183
Go inside.

1:11:07.267 --> 1:11:08.977
You have led dogs to me.

1:11:09.645 --> 1:11:10.812
I have done nothing.

1:11:10.896 --> 1:11:12.064
I will shoot you.

1:11:12.564 --> 1:11:14.608
No.

1:11:15.943 --> 1:11:16.985
Look.

1:11:17.069 --> 1:11:19.488
Onion. Rub.

1:11:20.614 --> 1:11:23.784
Dogs cannot smell. Take it.

1:11:26.995 --> 1:11:27.996
Look.

1:11:33.836 --> 1:11:35.003
You are mad.

1:11:36.839 --> 1:11:37.840
To hell with you.

1:12:25.012 --> 1:12:26.722
There's something there.

1:12:50.078 --> 1:12:51.163
Bitch got a scent.

1:12:57.753 --> 1:12:59.046
Come on down, boy!

1:13:01.215 --> 1:13:03.342
Goddamn it, get your ass down from there!

1:13:04.885 --> 1:13:07.262
-Get back.
-Don't point that goddamn gun at me.

1:13:07.346 --> 1:13:08.805
-Get back!
-Get your ass down here!

1:13:09.389 --> 1:13:10.516
You do not own me!

1:13:10.599 --> 1:13:12.309
I am not going back!

1:13:12.893 --> 1:13:14.603
I am not a slave.

1:13:15.729 --> 1:13:17.147
I am a man.

1:13:17.856 --> 1:13:18.857
I am a man!

1:13:19.942 --> 1:13:22.945
I am a man! I--

1:13:40.879 --> 1:13:42.548
There you go. Come on.

1:13:57.312 --> 1:13:58.605
Where's your friend?

1:14:07.948 --> 1:14:09.199
Where's your friend?

1:14:18.667 --> 1:14:19.835
No more running.

1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:35.684
Where's your friend?

1:14:42.649 --> 1:14:44.026
Where's your friend?

1:15:22.773 --> 1:15:24.066
Bring this back to camp.

1:15:53.637 --> 1:15:54.638
Come on.

1:16:17.578 --> 1:16:18.579
Sent away?

1:16:19.746 --> 1:16:20.956
Sent where?

1:16:21.039 --> 1:16:22.165
Up Atchafalaya.

1:16:24.751 --> 1:16:25.752
Mama, you can't.

1:16:27.296 --> 1:16:28.630
Man sold me off.

1:16:31.175 --> 1:16:32.426
We need to run.

1:16:32.509 --> 1:16:34.970
Hey. Do you know what happens to runners?

1:16:40.017 --> 1:16:41.518
We can't do nothing.

1:16:44.188 --> 1:16:45.856
You're getting sent away, Mama.

1:16:46.523 --> 1:16:50.194
-We can't do nothing.
-I know. Don't you know? I know, Betsy.

1:16:51.236 --> 1:16:52.237
Yes.

1:16:55.490 --> 1:16:57.242
Did I say I'm doing nothing?

1:17:00.537 --> 1:17:01.371
No.

1:17:03.957 --> 1:17:08.045
-Then damn it, stop running your mouth.
-I'm sorry, Mama.

1:17:12.841 --> 1:17:16.470
End of the workday,
come see me by the gin barn.

1:17:18.972 --> 1:17:20.140
Don't be late.

1:18:19.950 --> 1:18:21.159
You keep pace there.

1:18:22.661 --> 1:18:24.955
-Keep it coming.
-Yes, sir.

1:18:25.038 --> 1:18:26.373
Nice and steady.

1:18:34.715 --> 1:18:37.092
Watch them sides!
Don't leave 'em hanging.

1:18:46.018 --> 1:18:48.145
Don't leave so much.
You can fit more in there.

1:18:48.228 --> 1:18:49.229
Let's go!

1:18:51.440 --> 1:18:52.441
Steady.

1:18:52.524 --> 1:18:55.944
Get it before the damn sun goes down.

1:18:56.445 --> 1:18:57.905
We need to stay together.

1:18:59.990 --> 1:19:01.325
There ain't no other way?

1:19:01.408 --> 1:19:03.452
It's the only way. Okay.

1:19:04.494 --> 1:19:07.581
Do it… Now!

1:23:37.434 --> 1:23:39.603
Come.

1:24:14.638 --> 1:24:17.140
I will get you water. Water.

1:24:22.479 --> 1:24:23.981
I want to get you water.

1:24:43.417 --> 1:24:46.670
God loves you.

1:24:53.260 --> 1:24:54.386
God loves you.

1:24:55.929 --> 1:24:56.930
God loves you.

1:24:57.514 --> 1:24:58.557
Don't you move.

1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:01.351
Do not shoot. Don't-- Do not shoot.

1:25:04.229 --> 1:25:05.522
I got you now, boy.

1:25:09.484 --> 1:25:10.903
Take that knife out your belt.

1:25:10.986 --> 1:25:13.322
Okay. Please, do-- Please.

1:25:13.405 --> 1:25:15.282
-Do it!
-Okay.

1:25:18.202 --> 1:25:19.203
Right there.

1:25:20.245 --> 1:25:21.830
Do not shoot.

1:25:23.081 --> 1:25:25.751
-She alive?
-She's just a child.

1:25:25.834 --> 1:25:27.419
I asked if she's alive!

1:25:27.503 --> 1:25:30.422
Yes. She's in a bad way.

1:25:32.174 --> 1:25:33.342
So leave it then.

1:25:36.220 --> 1:25:39.431
-Let me get her water. I--
-I said leave it!

1:25:44.645 --> 1:25:46.730
No.

1:25:48.732 --> 1:25:51.318
Now get up, boy. She gone.

1:25:54.988 --> 1:25:55.989
Up!

1:26:01.453 --> 1:26:02.454
That's it.

1:26:05.415 --> 1:26:06.542
Now walk, boy--

1:26:07.584 --> 1:26:08.627
Fucking nigger!

1:26:20.055 --> 1:26:21.056
You.

1:26:22.391 --> 1:26:24.017
You fought that gator.

1:26:25.561 --> 1:26:28.480
You fought that gator and survived.

1:26:32.442 --> 1:26:33.944
You are the worst kind.

1:26:36.196 --> 1:26:37.823
The worst kind.

1:26:39.074 --> 1:26:40.576
Well, you got a family.

1:26:44.872 --> 1:26:47.624
My boss can help you. Come on--

1:27:16.987 --> 1:27:23.202
The same boy. He ran to the field--

1:31:06.758 --> 1:31:07.759
Lincoln.

1:31:09.678 --> 1:31:10.679
Lincoln.

1:31:11.597 --> 1:31:12.598
Lincoln.

1:31:47.716 --> 1:31:48.717
Humble down.

1:31:50.344 --> 1:31:51.470
Humble down.

1:32:25.629 --> 1:32:26.630
Here's your meat.

1:32:29.967 --> 1:32:30.968
Beg.

1:32:32.344 --> 1:32:33.345
Beg.

1:32:34.137 --> 1:32:35.472
Beg, dog.

1:32:36.139 --> 1:32:37.140
Beg.

1:32:37.683 --> 1:32:38.517
Beg!

1:32:47.568 --> 1:32:48.819
Beg.

1:32:52.072 --> 1:32:54.116
I told you I was your God.

1:33:21.476 --> 1:33:22.978
You are not my God.

1:33:48.545 --> 1:33:49.880
Captain Andre Cailloux.

1:33:50.839 --> 1:33:52.257
1st Louisiana Native Guard.

1:33:54.676 --> 1:33:55.677
You are with Lincoln?

1:33:56.261 --> 1:33:57.095
Yes, we are.

1:33:57.179 --> 1:33:58.597
-Give the man some water.
-Yes, sir.

1:34:01.183 --> 1:34:02.184
Water.

1:34:11.318 --> 1:34:12.277
You alone?

1:34:18.158 --> 1:34:20.077
Can you take me to my family?

1:34:21.537 --> 1:34:22.579
-Help this man.
-Yes, sir.

1:34:22.663 --> 1:34:24.289
Get him shoes. Take his shoes!

1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:28.961
Come on.

1:34:51.692 --> 1:34:53.110
What are they, Papa?

1:34:54.611 --> 1:34:56.697
God's little angels.

1:34:58.115 --> 1:34:59.533
Why are they here?

1:35:00.742 --> 1:35:01.952
They guide our way.

1:36:09.102 --> 1:36:12.272
Didn't think you
would make it. Your leg was so infected.

1:36:13.565 --> 1:36:14.566
Where is this?

1:36:15.901 --> 1:36:17.027
Baton Rouge.

1:36:22.199 --> 1:36:23.909
I must get to my family.

1:36:25.744 --> 1:36:27.079
You must rest.

1:38:00.255 --> 1:38:01.298
Your name?

1:38:02.591 --> 1:38:03.800
Peter.

1:38:03.884 --> 1:38:04.885
Age?

1:38:07.387 --> 1:38:08.764
I don't know.

1:38:08.847 --> 1:38:09.848
Well, pick something.

1:38:12.267 --> 1:38:13.393
You pick something.

1:38:22.361 --> 1:38:23.362
Forty-eight.

1:38:25.531 --> 1:38:26.990
Did you know your parents?

1:38:29.451 --> 1:38:30.410
Yes.

1:38:30.494 --> 1:38:31.495
Where were they from?

1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:33.288
Haiti.

1:38:33.872 --> 1:38:36.583
Haiti. Is that where you were born?

1:38:37.835 --> 1:38:38.836
Yes.

1:38:39.461 --> 1:38:40.504
Former owner?

1:38:42.005 --> 1:38:45.092
Lyons. Captain John Lyons.

1:38:46.051 --> 1:38:50.222
Cotton planter. The Atchafalaya River.

1:38:50.848 --> 1:38:52.850
Atchafalaya. Is that where you ran from?

1:38:54.935 --> 1:38:59.523
No. The Army men come, take me to Clinton.
I run from there.

1:39:00.148 --> 1:39:01.149
Clinton.

1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:04.361
See.

1:39:09.074 --> 1:39:10.659
Did you see a railway in Clinton?

1:39:13.078 --> 1:39:14.788
Train cars carrying big guns?

1:39:15.664 --> 1:39:18.417
Yes, I built the tracks.

1:39:20.544 --> 1:39:21.628
Am I not free?

1:39:21.712 --> 1:39:23.088
Just keep yourself steady.

1:39:25.632 --> 1:39:28.010
Technically, while you're here,
you're contraband.

1:39:28.886 --> 1:39:29.887
Stolen property.

1:39:31.305 --> 1:39:32.764
I must get to my family.

1:39:34.266 --> 1:39:38.061
-Dodienne, Betsy, Scipion…
-No.

1:39:38.145 --> 1:39:39.646
-…Laurette.
-No.

1:39:39.730 --> 1:39:41.773
-Write their names down.
-No, that is not how this is.

1:39:41.857 --> 1:39:44.860
You write down their names.
Lincoln say I am free.

1:39:44.943 --> 1:39:46.737
He did? Well, that's a good thing.

1:39:48.655 --> 1:39:50.908
Next time you see Lincoln,
please give him my compliments.

1:39:52.117 --> 1:39:55.662
Right now you're in an army camp,
during a time of war.

1:39:57.080 --> 1:39:58.415
Understand?

1:39:58.498 --> 1:40:00.709
So you and everyone else who ran here
has a choice.

1:40:02.002 --> 1:40:03.545
You'll work on one of the Federal farms…

1:40:03.629 --> 1:40:05.005
-governed by this here…
-I will not.

1:40:05.088 --> 1:40:07.049
-…set of rules and regulations…
-I will not.

1:40:08.133 --> 1:40:10.594
Or you will join the army.

1:40:12.846 --> 1:40:16.683
You help us beat these godforsaken devils,
my good man,

1:40:16.767 --> 1:40:18.769
and you will not just
get back with your family.

1:40:20.562 --> 1:40:21.980
You will help free your family.

1:40:25.567 --> 1:40:28.445
And I'm sure your good friend Lincoln
will be mighty proud of you…

1:40:30.739 --> 1:40:32.032
Mr. Peter.

1:40:33.325 --> 1:40:35.077
Show this man to the Native Guard.

1:40:36.119 --> 1:40:37.120
You're dismissed, soldier.

1:40:39.665 --> 1:40:40.499
Next.

1:40:49.341 --> 1:40:51.718
Gordon! Please.

1:40:51.802 --> 1:40:54.137
Gordon. Gordon, my friend.

1:40:54.221 --> 1:40:55.264
Good to see you, my friend.

1:40:55.347 --> 1:40:58.600
-Good to see you. How are you?
-We made it.

1:40:58.684 --> 1:41:00.853
Yes, we have.

1:41:00.936 --> 1:41:02.145
John?

1:41:02.229 --> 1:41:04.231
No, he did not make it.

1:41:04.815 --> 1:41:05.816
I will come see you.

1:41:07.067 --> 1:41:08.068
Thank you.

1:41:14.116 --> 1:41:16.493
Squad, attention!

1:41:20.706 --> 1:41:22.291
Squad, at rest.

1:41:23.917 --> 1:41:28.589
New recruits, eyes forward.
One arm-length from the next man.

1:41:29.464 --> 1:41:30.465
Move up.

1:41:32.009 --> 1:41:33.010
Welcome, Brother.

1:41:33.635 --> 1:41:34.970
You pick up your uniform up there.

1:41:43.103 --> 1:41:44.021
Bonsoir, Peter.

1:41:44.104 --> 1:41:46.982
Bonsoir. They're going to let us fight.

1:41:47.524 --> 1:41:48.734
They may not have a choice.

1:41:49.860 --> 1:41:50.861
Be ready.

1:41:51.445 --> 1:41:52.696
There he is, there.

1:41:54.698 --> 1:41:57.576
My leg is fine. You will not take it.

1:41:58.285 --> 1:42:01.538
Your-- Oh, no. We're not doctors, sir.

1:42:01.622 --> 1:42:04.458
No. We were alerted to your condition.

1:42:06.877 --> 1:42:09.171
Well, with your permission,
we were wondering

1:42:09.254 --> 1:42:11.465
if you wouldn't like to join us
for a few moments.

1:42:12.716 --> 1:42:14.718
It's okay. They're good people.

1:42:16.261 --> 1:42:19.014
A uniform will be waiting
when you get back. Yeah? Go on.

1:42:22.142 --> 1:42:23.894
-Right this way, sir.
-Thank you, Sister.

1:42:33.445 --> 1:42:34.446
All right.

1:42:35.155 --> 1:42:36.156
It's called a camera.

1:42:38.242 --> 1:42:39.201
What does it do?

1:42:39.284 --> 1:42:40.285
Well…

1:42:43.080 --> 1:42:44.081
See, it…

1:42:45.874 --> 1:42:47.000
makes a likeness of you.

1:42:49.002 --> 1:42:51.797
Peter, we're gonna make sure
that every person in the world

1:42:52.464 --> 1:42:54.466
knows exactly
what slavery truly looks like.

1:42:57.469 --> 1:42:58.470
All right?

1:43:02.140 --> 1:43:05.978
Now, if you could just
turn your back toward--

1:43:06.061 --> 1:43:07.062
Do not touch me.

1:43:10.691 --> 1:43:11.692
I'm sorry.

1:43:13.068 --> 1:43:18.073
If you could turn your back
towards the camera, please.

1:43:24.204 --> 1:43:25.205
And

1:43:26.039 --> 1:43:28.000
maybe put your arm out--

1:43:28.083 --> 1:43:30.544
Your hand on your hip, like so.

1:43:34.965 --> 1:43:36.216
And turn your head.

1:43:36.842 --> 1:43:37.843
A little more. Yeah.

1:43:39.428 --> 1:43:40.429
Is that comfortable?

1:44:11.335 --> 1:44:12.336
Thank you.

1:44:12.419 --> 1:44:14.338
You were born a free man?

1:44:14.421 --> 1:44:16.548
Yeah, that's right.
Bunch of us in this company.

1:44:17.466 --> 1:44:19.259
Allowed to read and to write?

1:44:19.927 --> 1:44:21.303
Allowed to do a lot of things.

1:44:22.721 --> 1:44:26.600
If someone must allow you to do something,
then you are not really free, are you?

1:44:28.352 --> 1:44:29.520
No.

1:44:31.647 --> 1:44:32.648
Sir?

1:44:37.361 --> 1:44:41.365
Captain Cailloux
and Private Peter reporting, sir.

1:44:43.283 --> 1:44:47.120
We know Johnny Reb has big guns
all along the ridge here.

1:44:47.955 --> 1:44:50.916
It seems they're putting new ones
down here, along the river,

1:44:50.999 --> 1:44:52.626
just south of Port Hudson.

1:44:53.710 --> 1:44:56.505
Now if we don't open up this bend here
along the Mississippi,

1:44:57.172 --> 1:44:58.841
we'll never control the South.

1:45:02.845 --> 1:45:05.264
Is this the Negro here
that was running from Clinton?

1:45:05.347 --> 1:45:06.348
Yes, sir.

1:45:08.058 --> 1:45:09.601
What were you doing there?

1:45:09.685 --> 1:45:11.353
We built the railroad.

1:45:12.604 --> 1:45:13.939
What did you see?

1:45:14.982 --> 1:45:15.983
It's okay.

1:45:16.066 --> 1:45:17.109
Cannons.

1:45:17.693 --> 1:45:18.694
Cannons?

1:45:19.361 --> 1:45:20.195
Like them?

1:45:22.865 --> 1:45:24.157
No, not like those.

1:45:25.367 --> 1:45:26.451
Big cannons.

1:45:28.203 --> 1:45:29.538
Did you see troops?

1:45:30.247 --> 1:45:31.582
Many soldiers.

1:45:34.209 --> 1:45:38.672
We've got to take Port Hudson
before those reinforcements arrive.

1:45:40.132 --> 1:45:41.675
General, permission to speak?

1:45:43.886 --> 1:45:45.596
Johnny Reb is dug in there real deep.

1:45:46.388 --> 1:45:47.639
There's only one way in.

1:45:49.308 --> 1:45:50.809
It's a killing field, sir.

1:45:50.893 --> 1:45:52.519
I know what it is.

1:45:54.938 --> 1:45:56.815
But somebody has to mount that attack.

1:46:06.783 --> 1:46:09.828
How the hell did you survive
all those days in the swamp?

1:46:10.329 --> 1:46:11.663
I know the swamp.

1:46:12.539 --> 1:46:13.665
Yes, well…

1:46:15.667 --> 1:46:17.252
doesn't mean you're fit for combat.

1:46:19.671 --> 1:46:23.759
In closed circles,
there's the great Negro question…

1:46:25.969 --> 1:46:29.056
Are you fighters, or are you runners?

1:46:32.726 --> 1:46:33.852
You know what I see here?

1:46:36.146 --> 1:46:37.147
Disobedience.

1:46:40.651 --> 1:46:41.652
Dismissed.

1:46:47.032 --> 1:46:48.033
Come on, now.

1:46:50.077 --> 1:46:52.788
Come on, boy. This ain't the time.
Come on, let's go.

1:46:53.956 --> 1:46:55.541
I fight them.

1:46:59.127 --> 1:47:00.003
And they beat me.

1:47:01.630 --> 1:47:02.631
They whip me.

1:47:04.091 --> 1:47:05.676
They string me up.

1:47:05.759 --> 1:47:06.760
They sell me.

1:47:08.262 --> 1:47:09.638
They throw me down a well.

1:47:11.056 --> 1:47:13.684
They pull me out and beat me again.

1:47:14.685 --> 1:47:16.395
And I fight them again.

1:47:18.021 --> 1:47:19.022
They cut me.

1:47:19.731 --> 1:47:23.735
They burn me.
They burn my neck. They burn my feet.

1:47:25.737 --> 1:47:29.199
They break the bones in my body…

1:47:31.076 --> 1:47:32.744
more times than I can count,

1:47:34.079 --> 1:47:35.414
but they never…

1:47:37.624 --> 1:47:39.001
never break me.

1:47:44.631 --> 1:47:45.966
We'll test that mettle.

1:47:49.219 --> 1:47:50.220
Captain,

1:47:50.971 --> 1:47:52.639
your men attack at dawn.

1:47:54.391 --> 1:47:55.392
Dismissed.

1:48:02.316 --> 1:48:04.776
You know, I used to run around New Orleans

1:48:04.860 --> 1:48:07.154
calling myself
the blackest man in America.

1:48:07.779 --> 1:48:08.864
You might got me beat.

1:48:10.532 --> 1:48:13.076
Tomorrow on the battlefield,
you're with me.

1:48:21.502 --> 1:48:24.004
-Go first.
-Yep.

1:48:40.020 --> 1:48:43.440
Left, left, left, right, left.

1:48:44.107 --> 1:48:47.361
Left, left, left, right, left.

1:48:47.861 --> 1:48:51.365
Left, left, left, right, left.

1:48:52.032 --> 1:48:55.327
Left, left, left, right, left.

1:48:55.953 --> 1:48:59.706
Left, left, left, right, left.

1:48:59.790 --> 1:49:03.252
Left, left, left, right, left.

1:49:03.877 --> 1:49:07.381
Left, left, left, right, left.

1:49:07.464 --> 1:49:08.465
Halt!

1:49:13.679 --> 1:49:14.888
All of us ran here…

1:49:19.434 --> 1:49:22.104
But as of now, no more running.

1:49:25.190 --> 1:49:29.570
Billy Yank and Johnny Reb,
they fight for money and power.

1:49:31.697 --> 1:49:33.073
We fight for something bigger…

1:49:35.993 --> 1:49:37.244
We fight for freedom.

1:49:38.745 --> 1:49:40.539
Not to prove something to some General.

1:49:41.748 --> 1:49:43.041
Freedom!
