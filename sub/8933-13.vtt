This is the Evergreen

00:02.102 --> 00:04.070
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:04.070 --> 00:06.573
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:08.108 --> 00:10.477
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.477 --> 00:12.145
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.680 --> 00:15.582
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.216 --> 00:17.450
Yikes!

00:18.118 --> 00:19.652
Yaaaah...

00:22.222 --> 00:23.623
Yeaaaah!

00:23.623 --> 00:26.826
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.967 --> 00:36.703
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:38.071 --> 00:39.406
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.909 --> 00:45.378
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.079 --> 00:47.714
the Raccoons!!

00:47.714 --> 00:48.114
♪ (show theme music) ♪

00:59.325 --> 00:59.893
Night in the Evergreen

00:59.893 --> 01:01.594
Night in the
Evergreen forest

01:01.594 --> 01:04.631
is the time when
mysteries unfold.

01:04.631 --> 01:07.867
And everyone knows,
when the game's afoot,

01:07.867 --> 01:10.837
Bert Raccoon is there to play.

01:10.837 --> 01:13.073
♪ (suspenseful music) ♪

01:20.246 --> 01:23.016
All set for operation
Spotlight, Cedric?

01:23.016 --> 01:25.118
Ooo, I sure am, Bert.

01:25.118 --> 01:28.088
Tax assessor arriving,

01:28.088 --> 01:29.722
eight o'clock tonight.

01:29.722 --> 01:32.692
Please make sure you are
available to take delivery

01:32.692 --> 01:35.095
of important tax document.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.131
There's only one way to deal
with the tax department.

01:38.131 --> 01:39.799
I'll skip town!

01:39.799 --> 01:43.236
Maybe I can find a nice
tax shelter and move in.

01:43.236 --> 01:44.804
All right,
everything's ready.

01:44.804 --> 01:47.707
Just make sure Cyril
doesn't catch on.

01:47.707 --> 01:50.477
And don't let Pop
out before you get there!

01:50.477 --> 01:52.612
O-kay!

01:54.614 --> 01:57.250
Uh, Pop,
we were wondering if...

01:57.250 --> 01:59.285
Don't bother me.
I've got to get to the car!

01:59.285 --> 02:02.122
But don't worry, Cedric.
I'll send for you.

02:02.122 --> 02:06.092
Pig 1: If operation Spotlight
is going according to plan,

02:06.092 --> 02:10.063
the boss should be arriving
right.. about...

02:10.063 --> 02:12.332
Ugh. Get me
out of here.. now!!

02:12.332 --> 02:13.600
Pig 1: Yes, sir!

02:19.072 --> 02:21.641
This is as good
a place to hide as any.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.809
Where are we, anyway?

02:22.809 --> 02:25.178
Cyril Sneer?
Huh?

02:25.178 --> 02:27.647
Surprise, Cyril Sneer.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.849
Because it's your
turn to answer...

02:29.849 --> 02:33.786
The Question of Your Life!

02:36.289 --> 02:36.890
Hey uh, here's potato chips

02:36.890 --> 02:39.392
Hey uh, here's potato
chips for anybody who wants'em.

02:39.392 --> 02:42.328
I see operation
Spotlight was a success.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.931
Ha, I have to admit, it's a...

02:44.931 --> 02:47.467
novel idea for a
Father's Day gift.

02:47.467 --> 02:50.470
Well, you know how
hard it is to buy something

02:50.470 --> 02:52.372
for the man who has everything?

02:52.372 --> 02:56.209
Well, Mr. Sneer,
I'm Dirk Dassie,

02:56.209 --> 02:58.611
and I'll bet you're surprised!

02:58.611 --> 02:59.712
Well, I.. umm.

02:59.712 --> 03:01.881
I'm sure you know
the rules of the game,

03:01.881 --> 03:05.718
but we'll have a quick review
for our studio audience.

03:05.718 --> 03:09.889
We're going to surprise you
with voices from your past.

03:09.889 --> 03:12.225
You must identify these voices,

03:12.225 --> 03:15.795
listen to their stories
about your life,

03:15.795 --> 03:17.864
and answer their questions.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.365
You're ready, Cyril?

03:19.365 --> 03:21.901
I'm ready all right!
I'm ready to leave!

03:21.901 --> 03:24.504
This is the dumbest
idea for a game show

03:24.504 --> 03:25.838
that I've ever heard of!
...and

03:25.838 --> 03:28.007
each correct answer earns you

03:28.007 --> 03:30.176
ten thousand dollars!

03:30.176 --> 03:32.445
Oooo!
Huh? What
are you waiting for?

03:32.445 --> 03:34.013
Alright Cyril,

03:34.013 --> 03:36.249
do you recognize

03:36.249 --> 03:38.117
this voice?

03:38.117 --> 03:41.588
Mystery Guest: Oooo, Mr. Sneer!

03:41.588 --> 03:43.523
Lady Baden-Baden.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.925
Oo, bang on, Cyril!

03:45.925 --> 03:48.027
Lady Baden-Baden:
Do you remember, Cyril?

03:48.027 --> 03:50.463
That golden moment when I asked,

03:50.463 --> 03:54.167
'Now..who would like to dance?'

03:54.167 --> 03:57.937
You made Knoxy so jealous!

03:57.937 --> 04:00.106
I always knew Cyril was a

04:00.106 --> 04:02.909
dashing and romantic figure.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.346
Cyril Sneer?

04:06.346 --> 04:09.148
Gettin' married?...Cyril?

04:09.148 --> 04:11.251
Naaaah, couldn't be!

04:11.251 --> 04:13.086
Ha ha, he ain't the type.

04:15.488 --> 04:16.923
Poor man.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.859
You're playing with fire, Sneer.

04:19.859 --> 04:23.196
And you're gonna get burned!

04:23.896 --> 04:26.733
Lady Baden-Baden: Yes, he
always had a strong sense

04:26.733 --> 04:29.102
of drama and romance,

04:29.102 --> 04:31.738
and he never demonstrated it
more clearly

04:31.738 --> 04:35.241
than on that foggy, foggy
morning of the duel,

04:35.241 --> 04:39.212
when he and Mr. Knox met
on the field of honour

04:39.212 --> 04:42.415
for my hand in marriage.

04:42.415 --> 04:43.950
According to the rules,

04:43.950 --> 04:47.820
the first challenger to find a
rare Evergreen lake clam pearl,

04:47.820 --> 04:50.556
and return, is the winner.

04:50.556 --> 04:51.824
Good luck, gentlemen.

04:51.824 --> 04:52.992
Good luck, Pop!

04:55.795 --> 04:57.830
Pop must really be in love

04:57.830 --> 04:59.332
with Lady Baden-Baden.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.501
He doesn't even
know how to swim.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.863
Pig 2: Oh no!
The boss is in trouble!

05:30.863 --> 05:34.300
Ooo, quick! Turn up
the air pressure!

05:43.910 --> 05:45.878
Uaaaaah!

05:45.878 --> 05:47.313
Pig 1: It's a bird!

05:47.313 --> 05:49.082
Pig 2: It's a plane!

05:49.082 --> 05:53.052
Pig 3: No.. It's ..super clam!

05:53.052 --> 05:55.054
Aaaaaaaa!

05:57.056 --> 06:00.093
Uuuh! Oooh!

06:01.027 --> 06:03.162
The winner!

06:03.162 --> 06:05.465
Lady Baden-Baden: Oo yes,

06:05.465 --> 06:08.568
it was so romantic!

06:08.568 --> 06:11.170
Dear Cyril may have
won the contest,

06:11.170 --> 06:14.173
but Knoxy won my heart.

06:14.173 --> 06:17.977
Now, my question of
your life, Cyril, is...

06:17.977 --> 06:20.580
'On the afternoon we danced,

06:20.580 --> 06:23.249
what was the colour of my gown?'

06:23.249 --> 06:26.552
Um.. I know it was big.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.755
Five seconds, Cyril.

06:28.755 --> 06:30.189
Bur.
Burp...

06:30.189 --> 06:33.259
ah..bur..purple...

06:33.259 --> 06:35.261
Her gown was purple!

06:35.261 --> 06:36.929
Uuuh, purple?

06:36.929 --> 06:41.000
Lady Baden-Baden's
dress was actually mauve,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.403
but the judges will
accept purple!

06:43.403 --> 06:46.606
You just won $10,000 !

06:48.608 --> 06:51.210
Before we break for
our commercial message,

06:51.210 --> 06:55.348
tell me, Cyril, do you
want to keep the $10,000 ,

06:55.348 --> 06:59.318
or try for the next big round?

06:59.318 --> 07:01.120
$10,000 ?

07:01.120 --> 07:03.523
Of course I'll go
for the next round!

07:03.523 --> 07:06.492
Oh, way to go, Cyril!

07:06.492 --> 07:10.997
Stay tuned for more
Question's of Your Life!

07:14.233 --> 07:14.333
Well...

07:14.333 --> 07:16.102
Well.. All right, Cyril.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.705
It's time for the
next thrilling round of

07:19.705 --> 07:22.742
the Question of Your Life!

07:22.742 --> 07:25.978
Does this voice ring a bell?

07:25.978 --> 07:27.447
Howdy, Mr. Sneer!

07:27.447 --> 07:30.283
That's Herman the hound,
who cheated me out

07:30.283 --> 07:32.752
of a billion barrel
big buck oil deal.

07:32.752 --> 07:34.086
Bingo!

07:34.086 --> 07:37.323
Yes, sir...
Cyril Sneer wanted my swamp.

07:37.323 --> 07:39.225
He was gonna drill for oil.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.360
I thought there was
nothing I can do.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.597
Pig 2: Five more minutes and
you'll be an oil maggot,

07:44.597 --> 07:46.132
er, magnate, sir.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.301
I don't see
why we have to wait.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.669
Gimme those scissors!

07:49.669 --> 07:54.874
Mr. Sneer, we must wait
until 5 o'clock sharp.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.743
Rules are not made to be broken.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.345
I hate rules.

07:59.345 --> 08:02.315
If there is another
person who claims this swamp,

08:02.315 --> 08:04.083
we must be fair.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.986
Look out! Oh no!!

08:06.986 --> 08:10.122
Don't worry.
This is a shortcut! Follow me!

08:10.356 --> 08:16.362
♪ (frantic music) ♪

08:16.362 --> 08:17.363
Uaaaah!

08:18.865 --> 08:21.467
Yeeoow!

08:22.602 --> 08:23.870
Whaaaahoooo!

08:23.870 --> 08:27.540
Ten, nine, eight...
Hold everything!

08:32.578 --> 08:35.982
Cedric!
Oh! Hi Pop.. Heh heh.

08:35.982 --> 08:39.018
What do you Raccoons
think you're doing in my swamp?!

08:39.018 --> 08:41.821
Ha. Your swamp?

08:41.821 --> 08:44.490
Yes, my swamp!

08:44.490 --> 08:46.893
You Raccoons get
out of here, pronto!

08:46.893 --> 08:49.328
I think you'll
find this in order.

08:49.328 --> 08:52.031
It's my deed to the swamp.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.867
It's a fake!
It's got to be!

08:54.867 --> 08:58.738
It looks perfectly
genuine to me, Mr. Sneer.

08:58.738 --> 09:01.240
Oh my. I'm afraid
you're trespassing

09:01.240 --> 09:06.512
on, uh, Herman Zachariah
Stroll's swamp.

09:06.512 --> 09:09.649
And that's the law, Mr. Sneer!

09:12.285 --> 09:14.186
If not for him,
I'd have been

09:14.186 --> 09:16.188
a one-man oil cartel!

09:16.188 --> 09:19.525
My question
for your life, Cyril is:

09:19.525 --> 09:23.095
'By how many seconds,
did you miss owning

09:23.095 --> 09:25.031
Beaver Bite Swamp?'

09:25.031 --> 09:27.700
That's easy!
How could I ever forget?

09:27.700 --> 09:30.136
Well, we all
hope you haven't, Cyril.

09:30.136 --> 09:32.705
Because the correct
answer is worth

09:32.705 --> 09:35.341
$10,000 !

09:35.341 --> 09:37.777
And if you get this wrong,

09:37.777 --> 09:40.580
you lose... everything!

09:40.580 --> 09:42.715
What? Now you tell me!

09:42.715 --> 09:47.186
I missed owning Beaver Bite
Swamp by..well, it was, uh...

09:47.186 --> 09:49.989
Food. Chewing. Eating.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.424
Eating.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.925
Eight seconds!

09:52.925 --> 09:56.329
You've got $20,000 Cyril!

09:56.329 --> 09:59.465
Do you want to go
for another ten?

09:59.465 --> 10:01.434
Go! Go! Go! Go!

10:01.434 --> 10:03.169
Go for it, Cyril!

10:03.169 --> 10:04.770
I think,
I'll go for it, Dirk.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.806
Oh way to go, Cyril!

10:06.806 --> 10:10.276
And now for our
next mystery guests.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.511
Guess whoooo??

10:12.511 --> 10:13.746
Pigs?!
Oohoohoo!

10:13.746 --> 10:15.781
On the money, Cyril!

10:15.781 --> 10:19.452
Pig 1: The boss has always
encouraged us to do our best...

10:19.452 --> 10:22.655
he uses a hands on approach.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.957
Oink!...ooh!

10:26.425 --> 10:28.828
Pig 1: Am I correct in
assuming that this medicine

10:28.828 --> 10:31.797
didn't make you feel
any better, sir?

10:31.797 --> 10:35.301
Pig 3: He's always
been fair, but firm.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.337
Pig 2: But sir, he's,
he's..scary!

10:38.337 --> 10:42.675
Scary? What does that
make me? Mr. Nice guy?

10:42.675 --> 10:44.777
Pig 2: N-n-no, sir.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.646
Then get going
before I turn you into

10:46.646 --> 10:48.447
a set of matched luggage!

10:48.447 --> 10:51.217
And the boss is always
quick with a compliment.

10:51.617 --> 10:54.253
Go take as shower.
You smell like pigs!

10:54.253 --> 10:56.422
You look, smell and are pigs!

10:57.690 --> 10:59.291
Pig 3: He makes sure
we get plenty of

10:59.291 --> 11:02.261
quality recreational time.

11:03.462 --> 11:05.798
Pig 2: This is it guys...
The jig is up.

11:05.798 --> 11:07.867
Pig 1: What are
you talking about?

11:07.867 --> 11:11.904
Pig 2: This! It's a bill from
the Mammoth Power Company!

11:11.904 --> 11:13.005
Pig 3: So what?

11:13.973 --> 11:15.675
We have hundreds of those.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.878
Pig 2: But, but this
is a, Final Notice.

11:18.878 --> 11:21.480
If this bill is not paid now,

11:21.480 --> 11:24.684
your power will be
cut off immediately!

11:24.684 --> 11:28.954
P.S. You owe 800% in interest.

11:28.954 --> 11:31.323
Pig 1: 800% ?

11:31.323 --> 11:34.627
Pig 2: I told you! We should
have paid the first bill!

11:34.627 --> 11:37.229
Pig 3: Well, the boss found out.

11:37.229 --> 11:40.700
Faster! Who needs
a power company anyway?

11:40.700 --> 11:43.235
Pig 2: You and your big ideas!

11:43.235 --> 11:44.737
Hiding the bills!

11:45.971 --> 11:49.008
It's not always easy
working for Cyril Sneer...

11:49.008 --> 11:50.509
but, it's never dull!

11:50.509 --> 11:53.879
And we'd like to do
our next reminiscence...

11:53.879 --> 11:55.881
to music!

11:55.881 --> 11:57.183
Pig 1: Hit it, boys!

going to get a raise?

Never!

From all
available reports,

13:24.837 --> 13:27.807
you're absolutely right, Cyril!

13:42.021 --> 13:44.423
you could walk away with

13:44.423 --> 13:47.426
$50,000 !!

13:47.426 --> 13:50.129
Are you going for it, Cyril?

13:50.129 --> 13:53.098
You bet your pearly
whites I am, Dirk!

13:53.098 --> 13:56.202

14:03.776 --> 14:06.846
Coming to you live,
from Evergreen studios.

14:12.451 --> 14:12.651
Well...

14:12.651 --> 14:14.220
Well.. Cyril,

14:14.220 --> 14:17.823
are you ready to carry
on to the final round of

14:17.823 --> 14:20.726
The Question of Your Life?

14:20.726 --> 14:21.994
Piece of cake!

14:21.994 --> 14:26.765
Let's have our
next mystery guest.

14:26.765 --> 14:28.200
Hiya Pop!
Cedric?

14:28.200 --> 14:30.202
Way to go, Cyril!

14:30.202 --> 14:34.173
Alright Cyril, let's see
if you know the next

14:34.173 --> 14:37.243
Question of Your Life!

14:37.243 --> 14:38.577
Everyone
thinks they know

14:38.577 --> 14:40.646
what Cyril Sneer is all about.

14:40.646 --> 14:44.416
The big money, Cedric,
goes only to the big players!

14:44.416 --> 14:46.752
Gee Pop, I don't know.

14:46.752 --> 14:50.756
Cedric, you do want to be
in the majors don't you?

14:50.756 --> 14:51.957
Sure.

14:51.957 --> 14:54.360
You do want to sign
your name at the bottom

14:54.360 --> 14:57.863
of a big fat
contract, don't you?

14:57.863 --> 15:00.900
Gee Pop, I don't
care about the money,

15:00.900 --> 15:03.535
I just want to be
a Mammoth Mudhen.

15:03.535 --> 15:06.805
You will be
a Mammoth Mudhen,

15:06.805 --> 15:09.942
with a Mammoth contract! Ha ha!

15:09.942 --> 15:12.444
I'll get you the
finest equipment

15:12.444 --> 15:13.879
money can buy.

15:14.680 --> 15:18.517
Well? Don't just
stand there, Cedric,

15:18.517 --> 15:19.785
get to work!

15:19.785 --> 15:22.121
Uh..sure Pop.
Right away!

15:22.121 --> 15:25.357
He always tries his best
to look out for me.

15:25.357 --> 15:27.860
The lead-off hitter
for the Evergreen Giants

15:27.860 --> 15:29.328
is Cedric Sneer.

15:29.328 --> 15:31.597
Wait'll you see
my son at bat, Mammoth,

15:31.597 --> 15:34.400
you'll be naming
a candy bar after him!

15:34.400 --> 15:37.536
That baseball
game was important to you.

15:37.536 --> 15:40.406
Admit it Pop, it
wasn't just the money!

15:40.406 --> 15:42.942
And as we head
to the top of the 9th,

15:42.942 --> 15:45.577
the Evergreen Giants
come to bat,

15:45.577 --> 15:47.746
down 5 to nothin',

15:47.746 --> 15:51.417
and this is their
last chance folks!

16:00.259 --> 16:02.928
This team has come to life!

16:02.928 --> 16:06.632
Two runs and the bases
are still loaded!

16:06.632 --> 16:07.933
Pig 2: Look at the boss!

16:07.933 --> 16:09.969
He's giving you the
secret sign to steal.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.137
No, wait! Now he
wants you to stay.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.973
No..it's steal again.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.308
Huh? Traded?

16:16.308 --> 16:20.346
Pig 3: Aaaaahhh!!

16:21.280 --> 16:23.682
Safe!
What a steal!

16:23.682 --> 16:27.353
And the Evergreen Giants
now are only down by 2!

16:32.858 --> 16:36.195
Thinking signing
bonus yet, Mammoth? Haha!

16:36.195 --> 16:39.064
But you know, there's
another side to my Pop.

16:39.064 --> 16:41.000
Remember the time
you were frightened

16:41.000 --> 16:43.969
by the return of Carl Snarl?

16:43.969 --> 16:46.305
And we ended up
hanging from the roof?

16:46.305 --> 16:48.640
Ohh! Aahh! Help!
I'm slipping!

16:48.640 --> 16:51.110
Do you hear
something, Cedric?

16:51.110 --> 16:54.346
Look! It's Ralph! We're saved!

16:54.346 --> 16:55.681
Maybe not.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.783
There's no stabilizer!

16:57.783 --> 17:00.319
Land, before it's too late!

17:00.319 --> 17:01.720
Just hold on!

17:01.720 --> 17:03.389
Cedric/Bert: Melissa?!

17:03.389 --> 17:05.224
He's a madman I tell you!

17:05.224 --> 17:07.159
He'll stop at nothing to get me!

17:07.159 --> 17:08.660
Pig 1: Have no fear, sir.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.562
I'll activate the fans.

17:10.562 --> 17:13.665
Fear? Fear?!
I'm afraid of nothing!!

17:13.665 --> 17:14.967
Look at my hand...

17:14.967 --> 17:17.002
Steady as the economy!

17:17.002 --> 17:18.871
I won't be taken alive,
I tell you!

That's my son out
there and his security...

17:41.927 --> 17:43.195
That was nice, Pop.

17:43.195 --> 17:46.265
You've always wanted
what's best for me.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.600
Cedric. What do
you think you're doing?

17:48.600 --> 17:51.236
Oh hi, Pop.
I'm baking a cake.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.606
It's for the Young
Aardvarks' Society bake sale.

17:55.207 --> 17:58.710
Hmm. To all mothers
of young aardvarks.

17:58.710 --> 18:02.347
Once again, we ask you to
contribute baked goods

18:02.347 --> 18:04.149
for our annual sale.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.452
Do you want me to... help?

18:06.452 --> 18:09.054
Nah, Pop.
I'm doing alright.

18:09.054 --> 18:12.224
Maybe I-I could,
uh, hire someone to do

18:12.224 --> 18:13.392
this sort of thing.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.194
Nah... I like doing it.

18:15.194 --> 18:18.764
Why don't you go
out and buy a nice cake?

18:18.764 --> 18:21.100
Nah, it just
wouldn't be the same.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.735
Well, do you want me to,

18:23.735 --> 18:25.604
come along to the bake sale?

18:25.604 --> 18:27.539
Oh no,
that's all right, Pop.

18:27.539 --> 18:29.775
I know you don't
like those things.

18:29.775 --> 18:34.213
Uh..well, buy me
your cake, at the bake sale.

18:34.746 --> 18:38.484
Oops..see, if you can
get a good deal.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.085
Sure, Pop!

18:40.085 --> 18:41.787
Yes. Mm.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.790
Well as soon as you're finished,

18:44.790 --> 18:47.726
come on up stairs
and cook some books.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.262
Will do, Pop.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.300
I'm... only a father.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.302
Whether you
admit it or not, Pop,

18:57.302 --> 19:00.072
sometimes you're
a pretty nice guy.

19:00.072 --> 19:04.309
Anyway Pop, my question
of your life is...

19:04.309 --> 19:07.312
'In the game with
the Mammoth Mudhens,

19:07.312 --> 19:10.983
what was the score at the
top of the ninth inning?'

19:10.983 --> 19:13.685
And remember
those rules, Cyril.

19:13.685 --> 19:16.755
We must have the correct answer,

19:16.755 --> 19:19.858
or you lose... everything!

19:19.858 --> 19:21.793
I know that one. Umm...

19:21.793 --> 19:23.996
Uh, 5-nothing.
What was that Cyril?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.531
Wait. It was...

19:25.531 --> 19:27.166
It was..golf..clubs..no...

19:27.166 --> 19:28.800
Oh, what's the matter..?

19:28.800 --> 19:31.703
What's that, Cyril?
We must have your answer.

19:31.703 --> 19:34.506
4!
4-nothing for the Mudhens!

19:34.506 --> 19:36.375
Oh Cyril...

19:36.375 --> 19:38.644
Wrrrong!

19:38.644 --> 19:41.380
Awwwww.
I'm sorry, but you lost.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.183
All that easy money! Gone!

19:44.183 --> 19:46.852
Pig 1: Maybe the boss'll
look on the bright side.

19:46.852 --> 19:50.489
I mean, after all, he
still has his health.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.057
Well, because you've been

19:52.057 --> 19:54.159
one heck of a contestant,

19:54.159 --> 19:56.962
we're going to give
you one more chance.

19:56.962 --> 19:59.498
For a consolation prize, Cyril.

19:59.498 --> 20:01.400
All you've got to do is

20:01.400 --> 20:04.469
identify... this person.

20:04.469 --> 20:07.339
Does this number
mean anything to you?

20:07.339 --> 20:11.343
2-4-6-B/LD

20:11.343 --> 20:13.245
My tax form number!!

20:13.245 --> 20:14.913
The tax man!

20:14.913 --> 20:16.848
Oh that's right, Cyril!

20:16.848 --> 20:19.218
It is the tax man!

20:19.218 --> 20:22.588
And here's your
consolation trophy.

20:22.588 --> 20:25.857
Gosh, that'll look
nice on the mantelpiece.

20:25.857 --> 20:29.595
Mr. Sneer,
it's my very great pleasure

20:29.595 --> 20:32.931
to present you with this
official communication

20:32.931 --> 20:34.700
from the tax department.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.368
No! No! I don't want it!

20:36.368 --> 20:37.936
I don't deserve it!

20:37.936 --> 20:39.671
You don't want it?

20:39.671 --> 20:41.506
Of course
I don't want it.

20:41.506 --> 20:43.942
Can you think of anybody
that would want it?

20:43.942 --> 20:45.611
Certainly I can.

20:45.611 --> 20:50.015
Might I suggest the
Evergreen Orphans Fund?

20:50.015 --> 20:51.550
Fine. Give it to them.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.386
The Evergreen Orphans Fund?!

20:54.386 --> 20:56.455
You saw it here,
ladies and gentlemen.

20:56.455 --> 21:01.426
Cyril Sneer is
turning over his $50,000

21:01.426 --> 21:05.364
tax refund to the
Evergreen Orphans Fund!

21:05.364 --> 21:07.032
What a guy!

21:07.032 --> 21:08.133
Yay!

21:08.133 --> 21:09.935
Did you say.. refund?

21:16.908 --> 21:17.542
I'm real sorry you lost the

21:17.542 --> 21:20.112
I'm real sorry you lost
the grand prize, Cyril.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.447
And giving that $50,000

21:22.447 --> 21:24.583
tax refund to the orphans?

21:24.583 --> 21:26.685
That was beautiful, Pop.

21:26.685 --> 21:29.554
It was...
the least I could do.

21:29.554 --> 21:32.524
Why don't you boys
run along now?

21:34.426 --> 21:36.728
Your Pop has
really changed, Cedric.

21:36.728 --> 21:39.164
I can remember when
this sort of thing

21:39.164 --> 21:40.766
would have driven him nuts!

21:41.933 --> 21:45.137
It was just
a game, that's all...

21:45.137 --> 21:47.372
Just a game!
