- Welcome, Henry.

00:45.100 --> 00:47.860

- We're hugging more.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.480
- Yeah.
- Hey!
- And now there's five of us.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.230
Look, I know.
She said it was gonna be a week,

09:42.430 --> 09:44.860
it's been two months.
But you guys have been amazing.

09:45.060 --> 09:46.920
We get that
she's in a tough spot.

09:48.420 --> 09:50.670
I'm enabling her, aren't I?

09:55.220 --> 09:56.700
Do you want the truth,
or do you want me to smile

09:56.900 --> 09:58.490
and nod
and tell you you're pretty?

09:58.690 --> 10:00.700
[sighs]
All right, fine, I know.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.540
It's one thing for me
to deal with my sister.

10:02.740 --> 10:04.750
It's quite another to have the
two of you deal with her, but...

10:04.950 --> 10:06.250
she's looking for a sign.

10:06.450 --> 10:07.630
And you know what,
I'm gonna give it to her.

10:07.830 --> 10:09.210
I'm gonna kick her out today.

10:09.410 --> 10:12.090
Whoa, no, no, no, no. You cannot
kick someone out on Christmas.

10:12.290 --> 10:15.760
Okay, either I do it today
or you two do it.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.530
- Today works for me.
- Today's great, yeah.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.770
Okay, here's one,
if you could go back in time

10:21.970 --> 10:23.690
and live in any period
of history,

10:23.890 --> 10:25.230
which one would you want
to live in?

10:25.430 --> 10:27.610
Uh, well, I'm Black and trans.

10:27.810 --> 10:29.440
Not a ton of good options.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.280
You are not wrong.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.780
But from a pure
fashion perspective,

10:33.980 --> 10:36.240
I do admire the simplicity
of the Roman Empire.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.950
Oh, I bet
the Romans would still be

10:38.150 --> 10:39.370
thriving if they saw you
in a toga.

10:39.570 --> 10:40.910
Mm.

10:41.110 --> 10:42.710
And avoided lead poisoning.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.330
And fought off the Goths.

10:44.530 --> 10:46.670
And not suffered under
the weight of their own empire.

10:46.870 --> 10:48.880
[laughs]
You are such a nerd.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.460
What about you? What era?

10:51.660 --> 10:54.970
You know, I used to say
the Age of Enlightenment, but...

10:55.170 --> 10:57.760
actually, now I think
I'd say present times.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.680
- The present time?
- Mm-hmm.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.310
- The world right now
is a dumpster fire.
- It is.

11:02.510 --> 11:04.410
But the world right now
has you in it.

11:05.450 --> 11:07.400
- You are so cheesy.
- [chuckles]

11:07.600 --> 11:09.570
And I love it.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.940
But I would like to see you

11:12.140 --> 11:13.780
in some white tights
and buckled shoes.

11:13.980 --> 11:15.530
Oh, hello, roleplay.

11:15.730 --> 11:17.360
- [laughs]
- So...

11:17.560 --> 11:19.450
we usually get back
from church at around 6:30.

11:19.650 --> 11:21.490
What time are you
and Charlie gonna come over?

11:21.690 --> 11:23.910
Well, actually,
uh, Charlie's mom

11:24.110 --> 11:26.290
will be dropping them off
at the house because...

11:26.490 --> 11:28.380
I'm gonna go to church with you.

11:28.580 --> 11:29.840
Hold up.

11:30.030 --> 11:31.670
You said you'd never go back.

11:31.870 --> 11:32.960
You're coming to church?

11:33.160 --> 11:35.010
[chuckles] If that's okay.

11:35.210 --> 11:37.550
So you're really trying
to make all my dreams

11:37.750 --> 11:39.300
come true, then?

11:39.500 --> 11:41.610
It's kind of become
my life's mission.

11:45.660 --> 11:47.580
[chuckles]

11:48.660 --> 11:50.980
Okay, if you won't allow me
to cook...

11:51.180 --> 11:53.650
Ah, ah, ah. I am not the one
not allowing you to cook.

11:53.850 --> 11:55.360
Your doctor,
who doesn't want you

11:55.560 --> 11:56.700
to have another heart attack,

11:56.900 --> 11:58.530
is the one
not allowing you to cook.

11:58.730 --> 12:01.280
Okay, fine. Please.
Don't under-salt the masa.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.080
[gasps] I will have you know
that my salt-to-masa ratio

12:04.280 --> 12:06.120
is so perfect,
it should be featured

12:06.320 --> 12:07.790
in <i>Better Homes</i>
<i>and Tamales Magazine.</i>

12:07.990 --> 12:10.330
Thank you for doing all of this.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.960
It smells wonderful.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.670
You're welcome.

12:13.870 --> 12:16.510
You know, I may not be cleared

12:16.710 --> 12:18.590
for the stresses of the kitchen,

12:18.790 --> 12:21.220
but as of today, it's eight
weeks since my heart attack,

12:21.420 --> 12:23.260
which means...

12:23.460 --> 12:25.720
I'm officially cleared
for something else.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.350
Oh, and what might that be?

12:28.550 --> 12:30.730
Sex. I'm talking about sex.

12:30.930 --> 12:32.650
I know, Jorge.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.400
I was trying to be flirty.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.440
- [laughing]
- Oh, sorry.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.780
It's been such a long time. And
I feel like a 15-year-old boy

12:38.980 --> 12:41.320
- about to see his first boob.
- Oh. [laughs]

12:41.520 --> 12:43.280
And the way you look
in that dress, <i>mujer,</i>

12:43.480 --> 12:45.160
you got me all distracted.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.370
- Ah.
- Have I told you today

12:47.570 --> 12:49.210
that you... [smooches]

12:49.410 --> 12:51.500
are the most beautiful woman...
[smooches]

12:51.700 --> 12:53.090
...on Earth?

12:53.280 --> 12:54.880
Hmm.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.840
Oh, okay, okay, food can wait.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.420
Bedroom, now.

12:58.620 --> 13:00.090
Yeah? Who needs a bedroom?

13:00.290 --> 13:02.640
[gasps] Hmm.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.970
[moaning]

13:05.170 --> 13:06.850
[both laughing]

13:07.050 --> 13:08.350
- Okay. Oh!
- [door opens]

13:08.550 --> 13:09.770
[Beatriz clears throat]

13:09.970 --> 13:11.560
You kids making out in there?

13:11.760 --> 13:13.710
"Kids"? Dad, I'm 53.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.500
Oh, you want to try the masa?

13:20.420 --> 13:22.410
Masa needs more salt.

13:22.610 --> 13:24.050
<i>Papi,</i> out!

13:25.680 --> 13:28.550
- Don't say a word.
- Okay.

13:29.760 --> 13:32.290
- [laughter]
- [clamoring]

13:32.490 --> 13:34.480
Hey.

13:36.310 --> 13:38.340
What just happened?

13:38.540 --> 13:41.550
Why was it fun
and now it's weird?

13:41.750 --> 13:43.390
I think my phone is...

13:43.590 --> 13:45.010
about to ring.

13:45.210 --> 13:47.060
Oh, my God,
you guys are the worst.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.620
Just get out, just get out!

13:51.490 --> 13:53.020
Chin up, kiddo.

13:53.220 --> 13:54.860
Okay...

13:55.050 --> 13:56.610
What's going on?

13:56.810 --> 13:59.280
Um, Lil, why don't you
just take a seat?

13:59.480 --> 14:01.280
Why does it feel
like my brother's about

14:01.480 --> 14:02.910
- to break up with me?
- Well...

14:03.100 --> 14:05.660
that's very astute of you,
because I actually am.

14:05.860 --> 14:07.660
Uh, you know, the past few
months, they've been amazing.

14:07.860 --> 14:09.160
So much fun.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.250
But something's shifted
and sometimes, you know, people,

14:11.450 --> 14:13.920
they-they move in different
directions without wanting to.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.790
And I would say
that it's me and not you,

14:15.990 --> 14:17.670
but it's, like, 100% you.

14:17.870 --> 14:20.130
Wait. Are you kicking me out?

14:20.330 --> 14:21.420
Yeah. Was that not clear?

14:21.620 --> 14:22.930
Jorgito, no! Why?

14:23.120 --> 14:25.090
Because you said a week,
it's been eight.

14:25.290 --> 14:27.510
Okay? I live with other people.

14:27.710 --> 14:29.390
- It's just not cool anymore.
- But I'm such a good guest!

14:29.590 --> 14:31.350
Lily, Lily, Lily! A good guest?

14:31.550 --> 14:34.600
A good guest?
Underwear is not a bath mat.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.060
You never clean out the jars

14:36.260 --> 14:37.770
before you take them
to recycling.

14:37.970 --> 14:39.190
That goes straight
to landfill, Lil.

14:39.390 --> 14:40.860
And I know you've been using
my Crème de la Mer.

14:41.060 --> 14:42.860
- No, I have not.
- Are you gonna
actually stand here

14:43.060 --> 14:44.950
and lie about it right now?
You're literally glowing

14:45.150 --> 14:46.570
from within. How do you think
I wouldn't notice that?

14:46.770 --> 14:49.080
And the dishes
in the sink, okay?

14:49.280 --> 14:51.120
Everything is in there to soak.
You know what doesn't need

14:51.320 --> 14:53.210
to soak, Lil?
A plate that salad was on.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.500
- Yes, well, sometimes it does.
- No!

14:54.700 --> 14:56.210
- Okay.
- It doesn't, it doesn't!

14:56.410 --> 14:58.340
[exhales]

14:58.530 --> 15:00.710
Okay, I love you

15:00.910 --> 15:03.840
so much,
which is why you have to go.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.130
Where am I gonna go?

15:05.330 --> 15:06.890
- I don't know,
go home, go home!
- Where? Where?

15:07.090 --> 15:08.430
- Mom and Dad would love
to have you home.
- Oh, a 29-year...

15:08.630 --> 15:09.890
No, a 29-year-old woman

15:10.090 --> 15:11.640
moving back in with her parents?
I can't!

15:11.840 --> 15:15.230
Okay, fair, pick from the one of
a million other family members.

15:15.430 --> 15:17.310
- Okay, like who?
- <i>Tía</i> Nene, five-bedroom,

15:17.510 --> 15:19.110
- all alone.
- It's so spooky there.

15:19.310 --> 15:22.110
Okay, well, you just stay out
of the porcelain doll room.

15:22.310 --> 15:24.740
Henry, a little help here?

15:24.940 --> 15:27.530
[Henry] Lil, you never
use a coaster

15:27.730 --> 15:29.170
no matter how much I beg!

15:30.510 --> 15:32.370
Nick?

15:32.570 --> 15:34.160
[Nick] I could make a full wig
with the amount

15:34.360 --> 15:36.540
- of hair that you leave
in the shower.
- Fine.

15:36.740 --> 15:39.210
- I'll leave.
- [Jorge] Yes.

15:39.410 --> 15:42.650
Thank you, thank you.
I love you so much.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.340
I love you, too.

15:45.540 --> 15:48.150
[clucks tongue]
Miss you already.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.560
[Andre] So, you and Lily,
what's the latest?

15:52.760 --> 15:54.310
Tell me all your dirty secrets.

15:54.510 --> 15:55.850
I'm gonna act like

15:56.050 --> 15:57.560
- you didn't just say that.
- Sorry, man.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.350
Sorry. You're my best friend.

15:59.550 --> 16:01.060
You're the one
who has to hear this.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.150
Like, I tell you Annie things.

16:03.350 --> 16:05.360
You don't really tell me
Lily things.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.610
But you could. Like,
what's up with you two?

16:08.810 --> 16:11.620
Well, uh, oh, she was so sweet.

16:11.820 --> 16:14.870
She, uh, brought me sunflowers
in memory of my mom.

16:15.070 --> 16:16.710
Oh, shit, man. That's right.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.120
It's been a year.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.920
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm really sorry.

16:20.120 --> 16:22.590
Hey, you know I love you, right?

16:22.790 --> 16:24.210
Love you, too, man.

16:24.410 --> 16:26.510
Yeah, that's right.
I love this man!

16:26.710 --> 16:28.260
- [patrons shushing]
- Hey, we in a book store.

16:28.460 --> 16:30.970
So Lily, sunflowers, continue.

16:31.170 --> 16:33.810
Right, right, right.
You know, actually,

16:34.010 --> 16:36.730
I'm the happiest I've ever
been in a relationship.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.310
We don't argue anymore.

16:38.510 --> 16:40.520
It kind of feels
like we're on the same page.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.400
But do you think it's weird
that she hasn't moved

16:42.600 --> 16:44.650
- back in with me yet?
- Have you asked her?

16:44.850 --> 16:46.570
I mean, not officially.

16:46.770 --> 16:48.280
Or casually.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.320
Considering that the first time
she moved in

16:50.520 --> 16:53.410
you two turned my Halloween
party into the <i>Maury Show,</i>

16:53.610 --> 16:56.120
I'd say taking it slow

16:56.320 --> 16:58.180
sounds smart.

16:58.380 --> 16:59.620
[Santiago chuckles]

16:59.820 --> 17:01.670
Look, I know, I'm just saying...

17:01.870 --> 17:04.090
since we've been back together,
it just...

17:04.290 --> 17:06.630
I don't know, it feels
like things are better now.

17:06.830 --> 17:08.630
Well, "better" is great,

17:08.830 --> 17:11.180
but sometimes you got
to have the tough conversations.

17:11.380 --> 17:13.050
Hey, look.

17:13.250 --> 17:15.010
If it feels good to you,

17:15.210 --> 17:17.160
I'm sure she feels the same.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.770
Thanks. Wow.

17:20.970 --> 17:23.270
That might be the first helpful
thing you said to me today.

17:23.470 --> 17:25.400
Yeah, well, I'm about
to say another one.

17:25.600 --> 17:28.860
Bruh, you need
to lock this down.

17:29.060 --> 17:31.490
This woman is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

17:31.690 --> 17:33.700
Look at you, all happy.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.660
- Hmm.
- You've come a long way.

17:35.860 --> 17:38.580
Yeah.
Yeah, she is special, huh?

17:38.780 --> 17:41.330
Special enough
for your mama's ring?

17:41.530 --> 17:43.790
Gonna let that marinate.

17:43.990 --> 17:45.210
Oh! Oh! Oh!

17:45.410 --> 17:47.400
How about this one?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.090
You know what?

17:50.290 --> 17:52.340
- Henry and Jorge would
actually love this.
- Yeah.

17:52.540 --> 17:54.800
But you bring it to the front,
all right? I'll pay for it.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.060
Good plan.

17:57.260 --> 17:59.730
- [bell dings]
- Okay.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.390
The naughty cookies are ready.
We've got schlongs,

18:02.590 --> 18:05.310
we've got titties,
and making, their grand debut...

18:05.510 --> 18:07.570
- Huh?
- Wow.

18:07.770 --> 18:09.780
What is that, artichokes?

18:09.980 --> 18:12.030
- It's a clitoris.
- Oh, I see it now.

18:12.230 --> 18:13.410
