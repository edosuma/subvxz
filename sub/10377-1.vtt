00:51.701 --> 00:52.800
Throw it here.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.035
Come on, Nelson,
throw it in here!

00:55.037 --> 00:57.705
Yeah! You almost had it!
I get one more?

00:57.707 --> 00:58.840
Strike three!

01:01.309 --> 01:03.478
Here comes Gretchen with the...

01:07.483 --> 01:09.450
Come on, Gretchen.
Over here.

01:14.274 --> 01:16.474
Here you go.
There it is.

01:16.476 --> 01:18.142
Gretchen, you almost had it.

01:27.687 --> 01:30.321
Dang it.
Nice throw.

01:30.323 --> 01:32.023
It's all right.
I got a ladder. I'll get it.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.425
Actually, just tell
Mrs. Donnelly it's on the roof.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.377
And she can get it
whenever she wants.

01:36.379 --> 01:37.628
Oh, That's good thinking, Clark.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.429
I'll just have 80-year-old
Mrs. Donnelly

01:39.431 --> 01:41.049
climb on her roof
to get her paper.

01:41.051 --> 01:42.800
Okay, cool. Thanks.

01:43.836 --> 01:45.837
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Clark. Hey.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.006
Y... I was kidding.
You can't do that.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.307
All right, fine.

01:49.309 --> 01:50.725
Here, give her one of these.

01:52.561 --> 01:53.895
This is yesterday's paper.

01:53.897 --> 01:55.897
Well, at least it's
not on the roof.

01:55.899 --> 01:58.733
Clark, don't pick your nose
in front of me, please.

01:58.735 --> 02:00.902
I'm not picking,
I'm scratching.

02:00.904 --> 02:02.520
What are you scratching,
your brain?

02:02.522 --> 02:03.921
Yeah, because it's huge.

02:06.659 --> 02:08.860
Aw! Chain break!
Not now.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.862
I have 86 houses left.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.530
Can you fix it?

02:14.099 --> 02:15.667
Gus, what should I do
with this?

02:15.669 --> 02:16.951
Uh, I'd flick it.

02:22.207 --> 02:24.759
Nelson leans
in and gets his sign.

02:24.761 --> 02:27.428
Here comes a fastball.

02:27.430 --> 02:29.097
Swing and a huge miss

02:29.099 --> 02:31.349
by Gretchen Peterson.

02:31.351 --> 02:32.650
Hey, losers.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.152
We have a practice
scheduled here.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.470
You gotta go.

02:35.472 --> 02:37.722
I thought your practice
was at 4:30.

02:37.724 --> 02:40.007
It is. But we wanna have
a practice <i>before</i> our practice.

02:40.009 --> 02:41.142
Oh, okay.

02:41.144 --> 02:42.110
Can we hit with you?

02:42.112 --> 02:43.611
No, you suck.

02:43.613 --> 02:44.962
Why don't you go home and

02:44.964 --> 02:46.464
build your <i>science</i> projects.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.601
Look, there's room
for all of us.

02:50.603 --> 02:52.620
W-we'll just play catch
off to the side.

02:52.622 --> 02:53.654
Listen.

02:53.656 --> 02:55.155
We have a game tomorrow,

02:55.157 --> 02:57.408
and there's only one field
to practice on.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.160
So... beat it!

03:01.414 --> 03:03.664
Maybe this is a sign
you should get a car.

03:03.666 --> 03:04.932
My mother said
I should hold off

03:04.934 --> 03:06.633
getting my license
for one more year.

03:06.635 --> 03:07.868
You know...

03:07.870 --> 03:11.238
just to make sure my reflexes
are fully developed.

03:11.240 --> 03:12.423
Stop it!
Hold him, Kyle.

03:12.425 --> 03:14.508
Troy, I think he wants some of
your famous beef stew.

03:14.510 --> 03:16.594
- Beef stew! Beef stew!
- Stop it!

03:16.596 --> 03:20.098
Beef stew! Beef stew!
Beef stew! Beef stew!

03:20.100 --> 03:21.032
No, no, no, no.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.019
No. Stop it.

03:25.021 --> 03:25.970
Oh!

03:30.160 --> 03:31.609
Hey!
Get off him!

03:31.611 --> 03:32.876
Later, fart face.

03:33.812 --> 03:35.129
Yeah, you'd better run.

03:41.754 --> 03:42.987
You all right?

03:42.989 --> 03:44.455
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:44.457 --> 03:46.624
Do you need us to call
your parents or something?

03:46.626 --> 03:48.759
It actually...

03:48.761 --> 03:50.861
didn't taste as bad
as you'd think.

03:55.801 --> 03:58.219
Nelson, wait!
Let's just go to my house!

03:58.221 --> 04:00.888
Oh, I love beef stew.

04:00.890 --> 04:03.790
Why do kids have to be
so fricking cruel?

04:10.683 --> 04:12.483
You know, I haven't been
on an actual field

04:12.485 --> 04:14.819
in almost 20 years.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.487
I've never even been on a field.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.387
If I tried, the kids
in my neighborhood

04:18.390 --> 04:20.708
would spit loogies
on my forehead.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.443
That's awful, Clark.

04:22.445 --> 04:24.495
Baseball's America's pastime.

04:24.497 --> 04:26.897
That's like saying
you've never had apple pie.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.134
You've never had apple pie?

04:30.136 --> 04:32.837
Well, my mom said
it would give me diarrhea.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.005
That's ridiculous.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.590
You have to try it
at least once.

04:35.592 --> 04:37.508
Diarrhea?

04:37.510 --> 04:40.544
No. Baseball.
It's the best.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.980
Hey. Let's come back here
later and hit some balls.

04:42.982 --> 04:45.132
Uh. Can I bring
Richie?

04:45.134 --> 04:46.400
He's never played either.

04:46.402 --> 04:48.686
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
bring Richie. Let's say 4:00.

04:48.688 --> 04:49.854
All right.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.189
Hold on.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.873
My mom's sending me
a text message.

04:54.476 --> 04:56.077
No way!

04:56.079 --> 04:57.428
We're having macaroni tonight!

04:57.430 --> 04:59.630
That means garlic bread.
Yes!

04:59.632 --> 05:01.833
Awesome.

05:04.670 --> 05:05.819
Excuse me.

05:05.821 --> 05:06.921
Yeah?

05:06.923 --> 05:08.772
I rented this movie
on your recommendation,

05:08.774 --> 05:11.759
and it's nothing but a <i>lame</i>
story with lesbian sex scenes.

05:11.761 --> 05:13.427
And you <i>didn't</i> like it?

05:13.429 --> 05:16.013
I watched it with my parents.
It was very uncomfortable.

05:16.015 --> 05:17.682
Come on. It's kind of hot.

05:17.684 --> 05:18.599
No, it's not.

05:18.601 --> 05:20.852
All right, I'm sorry.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.487
I'm gonna recommend this:
<i>Haunted Slumber Party.</i>

05:23.489 --> 05:25.139
It's actually
a pretty decent film.

05:25.141 --> 05:26.974
No lesbian sex scenes?

05:26.976 --> 05:29.060
I think there's two.
You're a pig.

05:30.929 --> 05:32.496
Hey, Richie, are you off yet?

05:32.498 --> 05:35.266
Uh, easy. I can't leave
this second, Clark, all right.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.734
I don't get to work
for an hour a day

05:36.736 --> 05:38.286
like you, paperboy.

05:38.288 --> 05:40.504
Gus wants us to hit
some baseballs with him.

05:41.406 --> 05:43.658
Clark, we don't play baseball.

05:43.660 --> 05:45.960
I told Gus we'd
be there, Richie.

05:45.962 --> 05:48.462
And if we don't go,
that makes me a liar.

05:48.464 --> 05:50.130
And that's not what I'm about.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.416
Not now, not <i>ever.</i>

05:52.418 --> 05:55.303
All right, Daytime Emmy.

05:55.305 --> 05:57.188
Hey, Marty, I'm gonna
split early, all right?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.690
I don't even know who you are.

06:00.542 --> 06:02.659
Bros before ho's, dude.

06:05.715 --> 06:06.830
Hey, Liz, honey,

06:06.832 --> 06:08.882
do you know where I packed
my baseball mitt?

06:08.884 --> 06:10.101
No idea.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.203
Hey, Gus, if we conceive
this month,

06:12.205 --> 06:13.670
we would have the baby
in January.

06:13.672 --> 06:15.907
Wouldn't it be fun to have
a New Year's baby?

06:15.909 --> 06:17.291
I can't find it.

06:17.293 --> 06:20.511
January also has a higher
percentage of it being a girl.

06:21.229 --> 06:23.047
I found it.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.365
I found it.

06:24.367 --> 06:27.084
I found my mitt, Liz.
It was in the old trunk.

06:27.086 --> 06:28.602
Be serious.
This is important.

06:28.604 --> 06:30.755
My ovulation peaks
at 6:00 tonight.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.689
All right, honey. I love you.
I'll see you later.

06:32.691 --> 06:35.426
I gotta run.
Remember, Gus, 6:00.

06:35.428 --> 06:36.643
Ahh.

06:38.214 --> 06:40.047
You gotta keep your eye
on the ball.

06:40.049 --> 06:42.216
Oh, you just think of that?
You're an amazing coach.

06:43.686 --> 06:44.969
Just focus.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.237
You'll be fine.
Just watch me.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.440
With this vest,
it's hard to swing.

06:49.442 --> 06:50.858
It's tight, you know.

06:50.860 --> 06:52.442
Quit picking your nose, Clark.

06:52.444 --> 06:53.611
Let's go.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.413
Look alive!
Coming to you.

07:01.803 --> 07:03.037
Ow.

07:04.707 --> 07:07.041
You just lost your membership
at Video Spot!

07:07.043 --> 07:08.826
Dang it.

07:08.828 --> 07:11.078
Hey, mister. We have
this field reserved.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.396
You and your friend
were the ones

07:12.398 --> 07:13.663
picking on that kid today.

07:13.665 --> 07:15.833
So? You douche bags
have to get off this field.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.501
Where's your coach?

07:17.503 --> 07:18.586
None of your business.

07:18.588 --> 07:20.171
We have practice here,

07:20.173 --> 07:21.472
so go, ho!

07:21.474 --> 07:24.258
Hey, well, no coach,
no field. Sorry.

07:24.260 --> 07:26.844
Leave our field, or you'll
pay the consequences!

07:26.846 --> 07:28.679
What is this,
<i>Children of the Corn?</i>

07:28.681 --> 07:30.931
I... I'm gonna call the cops.

07:30.933 --> 07:33.684
We are cops.
We're Navy SEALs.

07:33.686 --> 07:36.369
Navy SEALs aren't cops.
Aren't you our paperboy?

07:37.222 --> 07:38.855
I'm undercover.

07:38.857 --> 07:41.625
All right, you cocky jerks,
you want the field so bad?

07:41.627 --> 07:42.910
We'll play you for it.

07:42.912 --> 07:43.694
But there are nine of us

07:43.696 --> 07:46.030
and three of you.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.748
So you should beat us
no problem.

07:47.750 --> 07:49.449
What are you, scared?
No.

07:49.451 --> 07:50.368
Yeah, chicken.

07:51.537 --> 07:53.821
I'm gonna go ask our team.

07:54.923 --> 07:56.624
This is a bad idea.
They look tough.

07:56.626 --> 07:58.542
I saw that demon boy laying beef

07:58.544 --> 08:00.795
in some nice kid's
mouth earlier today.

08:00.797 --> 08:02.563
Heh-heh. Clark used to
get beef

08:02.565 --> 08:04.098
laid in his face all the time.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.432
Oh, and you didn't?

08:05.434 --> 08:07.568
I got wedgies.
That's different.

08:08.570 --> 08:10.054
It's cooler.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.022
We'll do it.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.890
Time to meet your makers.

08:12.892 --> 08:15.526
Makers of what?
Poop?

08:18.096 --> 08:19.430
Coming down!

08:20.265 --> 08:21.399
Ball's in.

08:21.401 --> 08:23.734
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

08:23.736 --> 08:25.102
Get your position down.

08:25.104 --> 08:26.753
Troy, strike this loser out.

08:31.126 --> 08:33.244
- Strike!
- Nice one, Troy.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.246
Don't swing if it's not
in the strike zone.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.746
Where's the strike zone?

08:36.749 --> 08:37.948
Strike two!

08:37.950 --> 08:39.448
- Right there.
- Nice. Two strikes.

08:42.169 --> 08:43.186
Strike.
Three, you're out!

08:43.188 --> 08:45.756
- Three.
- What did you expect? Yeah.

08:45.758 --> 08:47.141
- Pfft.
- What a loser.

08:47.143 --> 08:48.592
Sit down, spaz.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.127
That kid's throwing heat.

08:50.129 --> 08:51.562
Heat, schmeat.

08:53.516 --> 08:54.899
One out!
Gonna be two outs!

08:54.901 --> 08:56.600
Hey, I bet you're
a real good catcher.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.702
Of doughnuts, in your mouth.

09:00.421 --> 09:01.906
Strike!

09:01.908 --> 09:03.657
Don't chop at it.
It's not a sword.

09:03.659 --> 09:04.924
You're not a sword.

09:05.910 --> 09:07.445
Come on. Heave.
Strike two.

09:07.447 --> 09:08.779
Oh, that's ugly, man.

09:08.781 --> 09:10.531
Strike out, video boy.

09:10.533 --> 09:11.715
Come on now.

09:14.302 --> 09:15.919
Strike three!

09:15.921 --> 09:16.620
What?

09:16.622 --> 09:17.855
I caught it.
You're out.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.540
But I ticked it.
It hit the bat.

09:19.542 --> 09:20.791
You're still out.

09:20.793 --> 09:23.677
You're still fat.
I ticked it!

09:23.679 --> 09:25.045
Whoa, I ticked it.
Gus, you see that?

09:25.047 --> 09:26.413
Way to make contact
on that one.

09:26.415 --> 09:27.715
Oh, yeah.
You know what?

09:27.717 --> 09:30.684
I was trying to get under it
to rip it into left

09:30.686 --> 09:31.685
and to throw them off,

09:31.687 --> 09:33.554
but the dog barking threw me.

09:33.556 --> 09:35.705
What dog?
He's gone. He ran into the bushes.

09:35.707 --> 09:37.808
It's cool now. All right,
go, go, Gus. Come on!

09:37.810 --> 09:39.176
Let's get rid of these dogs.

09:39.178 --> 09:41.278
- Strike him out quick.
- Get this guy out.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.446
Move in.

09:42.448 --> 09:44.615
You're going down, shorty.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.657
- Guy's got nothing.
- Give him a fast one.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.524
Ho!
All right, Gus! Awesome!

09:54.860 --> 09:56.409
All right!
Yeah!

09:56.411 --> 09:57.578
Whoa.

09:57.580 --> 09:58.445
Way to stretch him.

09:58.447 --> 10:00.080
Woo! Yeah!

10:00.082 --> 10:02.733
He just did that steroid-free.
What's steroids?

10:02.735 --> 10:05.602
Something that makes
your pee-pee smaller.

10:05.604 --> 10:07.504
There must be steroids
in macaroni.

10:08.406 --> 10:09.640
Let's go.

10:11.961 --> 10:13.310
Nice!

10:14.180 --> 10:16.746
He got a lucky hit.

10:20.902 --> 10:22.770
- Here we go.
- Batter up.

10:22.772 --> 10:24.137
Batter up!

10:30.962 --> 10:32.595
Ah.

10:32.597 --> 10:33.614
Ho-ho.
- Strike!

10:33.616 --> 10:36.500
Ow! Not so fast.

10:36.502 --> 10:39.253
You're supposed to catch it
with your glove, not your face.

10:39.255 --> 10:40.621
Ya-yeah!

10:40.623 --> 10:42.756
I don't need lip from you,
son of Satan.

10:42.758 --> 10:45.325
- We're still in the thing.
- It's okay. Next time.

10:45.327 --> 10:46.543
Yeah.

10:48.447 --> 10:49.596
You're out!

10:49.598 --> 10:50.664
You're out!

10:52.101 --> 10:53.700
Strike three, you're out!

10:55.037 --> 10:57.104
Come on, Troy, he can't hit you.
Come on.

10:58.641 --> 11:01.275
Yes!
Yeah, Gu...! Are you okay?

11:03.613 --> 11:04.612
No way!

11:08.650 --> 11:10.183
- It's over!
- Yes!

11:11.152 --> 11:12.870
Yah!
Three, you're out!

11:12.872 --> 11:15.038
Gus. Sorry.
Shoot.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.573
Get another homer for us, Gus.

11:16.575 --> 11:17.807
Yeah, smack it in the butt.

11:17.809 --> 11:19.126
Whatever that means.

11:19.128 --> 11:21.362
Nah, I'm gonna keep
this one in play.

11:21.364 --> 11:23.964
Give the infield a workout.
It's 17-0.

11:23.966 --> 11:24.915
What an idiot.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.334
Come on, Troy.
Destroy him!

11:27.336 --> 11:29.253
Strike him out.
Strike this loser...

11:31.823 --> 11:33.690
Come on, Kyle, are you okay?

11:33.692 --> 11:35.408
- What happened?
- Get up.

11:35.410 --> 11:37.177
Hey, get him up.

11:38.430 --> 11:39.646
Ball's still alive, chumps.

11:40.932 --> 11:42.099
Dude, he's gonna score.

11:43.602 --> 11:44.802
Should somebody call 411?

11:44.804 --> 11:45.869
No, he's fine.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.404
He got the wind
knocked out of him.

11:47.406 --> 11:49.289
What's that noise?

11:54.112 --> 11:55.479
Get him!

11:56.831 --> 11:57.931
I think he just got the wind

11:57.933 --> 11:59.617
knocked back into him.

12:04.423 --> 12:06.323
Gus, why didn't you play
in high school?

12:06.325 --> 12:07.857
You're incredible.

12:07.859 --> 12:09.692
Um, the whole bully thing,
and jocks.

12:09.694 --> 12:11.094
I just didn't
wanna deal with it.

12:11.096 --> 12:12.229
Those butts!

12:12.231 --> 12:13.897
You could've gone
to the Super Bowl.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.465
Yeah, that's the past.

12:15.467 --> 12:17.217
Hey, Richie,
where's your brother?

12:17.219 --> 12:19.603
Howie! Come out here.
The guys are here.

12:19.605 --> 12:21.555
Is he still dealing
with that agoraphobia?

12:21.557 --> 12:24.190
Yeah, dude. He hasn't left
the house in six months.

12:25.326 --> 12:26.694
Hey. There he is.

12:26.696 --> 12:29.429
- Hey, Howie.
- How's it going, buddy?

12:29.431 --> 12:31.649
Hey, guys. How did
hitting the balls go?

12:31.651 --> 12:33.550
We played an actual game
against real people.

12:33.552 --> 12:35.903
You should have
been there. It was <i>classic.</i>

12:35.905 --> 12:38.421
All these punk teenagers
are like, "Get off our field."

12:38.423 --> 12:40.340
And we're like,
"We'll play you for it."

12:40.342 --> 12:41.875
And we did.
And we beat 'em.

12:41.877 --> 12:43.243
I hit a foul, dude.
It was sweet.

12:43.245 --> 12:45.045
Ha-ha.
It was awesome.

12:45.047 --> 12:47.498
You gotta videotape it
next time, so I can see.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.249
Buddy, just come with us.

12:49.251 --> 12:50.450
Huh. No. No.

12:50.452 --> 12:51.835
It's not that scary.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.887
And you could use
a little sun. Trust me.

12:53.889 --> 12:56.173
Outside, bad.
The sun, scary.

12:56.175 --> 12:57.541
It's not...
He's not my friend.

12:57.543 --> 13:00.311
He wants to hurt me.
He wants... Safe room.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.062
I know. Sun, bad.

13:02.064 --> 13:03.814
Is you cuckoo.
All right.

13:03.816 --> 13:06.517
You know the best part about
winning a baseball game?

13:06.519 --> 13:08.936
What's that?
Going to Pizza Hut to celebrate.

13:08.938 --> 13:10.203
Richie?

13:12.490 --> 13:14.224
Oh, yeah.
Okay, buddy.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.995
Ooh, is that apple juice?
No.

13:20.366 --> 13:23.434
Honestly, you have, uh,
real natural athletic skills.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.369
You could be a terrific
ballplayer, buddy.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.538
You know, when you throw it
to me, and I catch it...

13:27.540 --> 13:29.573
not with my face,
but with the glove

13:29.575 --> 13:30.708
Mm-hm.
...I like it.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.960
I am starting to get the fever.

13:34.846 --> 13:37.280
Dude, this chick is so hot.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.051
What's going on?

13:41.053 --> 13:43.186
Nothing. Just
refilling the bar.

13:44.121 --> 13:46.056
I love salad.

13:46.058 --> 13:47.624
Yeah, it's...

13:47.626 --> 13:49.359
good, and good for you.

13:51.529 --> 13:53.430
I love salad.

13:58.204 --> 13:59.486
That was some Barry White shit.

13:59.488 --> 14:00.487
Very smooth.

14:00.489 --> 14:02.422
Yeah, I work it when I have to.

14:02.424 --> 14:03.991
How's "Ms. Pac-Man"
treating you?

14:03.993 --> 14:06.093
That red ghost
is kicking my balls.

14:07.229 --> 14:09.580
Yeah, that's them, Uncle Jerry.

14:09.582 --> 14:12.082
Richie Goodman

14:12.084 --> 14:13.550
and Clark Reedy?

14:13.552 --> 14:16.253
What were you losers doing
on my ball field today?

14:16.255 --> 14:18.255
- Clark was. I was at home.
- They were with me.

14:18.257 --> 14:19.989
We were just hitting balls
and having fun.

14:19.991 --> 14:22.009
These kids showed up,
and we scrimmaged them.

14:22.011 --> 14:23.944
That is priceless.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.011
Clork the Dork

14:25.013 --> 14:27.815
and Richie Bitchy
playing baseball.

14:27.817 --> 14:28.982
Why is that so funny?

14:28.984 --> 14:30.516
Because they're retards.

14:30.518 --> 14:32.319
They should stick
to what they know best:

14:32.321 --> 14:34.738
boogers and dingleberries.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.341
<i>You</i> stay away from my field,

14:38.343 --> 14:40.828
or I'll have my 12-year-old
nephew kick your ass.

14:42.748 --> 14:44.447
Nice meeting you, Fairy Jerry.

14:45.867 --> 14:47.167
What was that?

14:47.169 --> 14:49.369
Well, you gave Clark
and Richie nicknames.

14:49.371 --> 14:50.821
I thought I'd give you one.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.256
Fairy Jerry.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.458
Oh, really?

14:54.460 --> 14:55.559
Really.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.494
Okay, Gus.

14:58.229 --> 14:59.712
Gus...

14:59.714 --> 15:01.381
Gus <i>Bus.</i>

15:01.383 --> 15:02.633
What?

15:02.635 --> 15:05.302
That's you. Gus Bus.

15:06.605 --> 15:08.104
Wow, that was
a brutal comeback.

15:08.106 --> 15:09.189
Let's go, guys.

15:09.191 --> 15:11.475
I don't think I'll ever
recover from that.

15:11.477 --> 15:12.810
Man. Whoo!

15:12.812 --> 15:14.695
You stay off my field.

15:14.697 --> 15:17.214
Heh. Stay away
from the fairy dust, Jerry.

15:17.216 --> 15:18.899
Oh.

15:18.901 --> 15:20.834
"Gus Bus"?
Shut up, Troy.

15:22.453 --> 15:24.154
It was the coolest, Gus.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.339
I've never seen anybody
stand up to Jerry like that.

15:26.341 --> 15:27.908
I knew guys like that
where I grew up.

15:27.910 --> 15:29.910
They think they can do
whatever they want.

15:29.912 --> 15:32.529
I just wanted to say
that was great,

15:32.531 --> 15:35.082
the way you put Jerry McDowell
in his place.

15:35.084 --> 15:36.700
That was no big deal.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.285
Well, unfortunately
for all of us...

15:38.287 --> 15:40.053
Jerry's in charge
of the baseball league

15:40.055 --> 15:41.121
for the entire county.

15:41.589 --> 15:43.056
Hey.

15:43.058 --> 15:44.892
Are you the kid that
got farted on earlier?

15:44.894 --> 15:47.261
Yes. This is
my son, Nelson.

15:47.263 --> 15:48.678
He's become quite
the fart magnet

15:48.680 --> 15:50.097
for the neighborhood bullies.

15:50.099 --> 15:54.017
I also get a healthy smear
of animal turds twice daily.

15:54.019 --> 15:55.168
When I was your age,

15:55.170 --> 15:57.738
Fairy Jerry dumped a bucket
of dog poop on me.

15:57.740 --> 16:00.407
His son just did that
to me last week.

16:00.409 --> 16:01.641
I tried to talk to
Jerry about it.

16:01.643 --> 16:03.660
He just laughed
and gave me a titty twister.

16:03.662 --> 16:06.497
Guys like that don't realize
the damage they're causing.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.699
I couldn't agree more.

16:11.285 --> 16:12.202
Yeah.

16:12.204 --> 16:13.453
Eww!

16:17.058 --> 16:18.058
Uh, by the way,

16:18.060 --> 16:19.426
thanks for hitting Kyle Wilson

16:19.428 --> 16:20.910
in the chest with the ball,

16:20.912 --> 16:23.496
and then letting me rip one
right in his mouth earlier.

16:23.498 --> 16:25.766
I-It was one of
the best days of my life.

16:25.768 --> 16:28.534
This car is so radical.

16:28.536 --> 16:29.452
Looks just
like K.I.T.T.

16:29.454 --> 16:31.722
from the show <i>Knight Rider.</i>

16:31.724 --> 16:33.440
It is K.I.T.T.
from <i>Knight Rider.</i>

16:33.442 --> 16:34.608
Wh...

16:34.610 --> 16:36.776
Watch this.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.511
<i>Allow me
to introduce myself.</i>

16:38.513 --> 16:39.646
<i>I'm K.I.T.T.</i>

16:40.949 --> 16:42.449
Who are you?

16:42.451 --> 16:43.883
Oh...

16:43.885 --> 16:46.052
I'm just one of those nerds
who grew up...

16:47.488 --> 16:49.573
to make billions.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.008
Maybe I'll see you guys around sometime.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.161
<i>It was a pleasure</i>
<i>to meet you all.</i>

16:54.762 --> 16:56.463
<i>Easy, Mel.</i>

16:57.800 --> 16:59.098
Whoa.
Whoa.

17:03.487 --> 17:06.557
I have yet to perfect
the peel-out.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.324
It was fine.
No, no, no.
That was cool.

17:08.326 --> 17:10.143
Bad.
Chicks were checking you out.

17:10.145 --> 17:12.796
<i>Try not to destroy me</i>
<i>completely, Mel.</i>

17:15.233 --> 17:16.449
<i>Ah! Ow!</i>

17:18.836 --> 17:20.637
Hey, honey, I'm home.

17:22.006 --> 17:23.656
Where have you been?

17:23.659 --> 17:25.492
I... I was with
Clark and Richie.

17:25.493 --> 17:27.660
I am on an ovulating schedule.

17:27.662 --> 17:30.280
You were supposed to be here
at 6:00. Remember?

17:30.282 --> 17:32.582
I thought you meant
Central Mountain Time.

17:32.584 --> 17:34.501
Did you mean
Pacific Standard Time?

17:34.503 --> 17:36.203
Why would you think
I meant that?

17:36.205 --> 17:37.837
Because you're from Colorado.

17:37.839 --> 17:40.424
Don't you, um, ovulate
according to where you're born?

17:40.426 --> 17:41.792
Gus, that's just weird.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.043
So from now on,

17:43.045 --> 17:45.579
it's Pacific Standard Time.

17:45.581 --> 17:46.629
Pacific Standard Time. Okay.

17:46.631 --> 17:48.765
I'm all over that, baby.
I'm sorry. I love you.

17:51.301 --> 17:53.086
Check out this mitt.
It's all black.

17:54.655 --> 17:55.855
I look like a Borack warrior

17:55.857 --> 17:57.857
from the <i>Captain Mighty</i> series.

18:01.430 --> 18:03.380
Well, get a load of Mega Mitt.

18:08.453 --> 18:09.870
Hey! Hey! What the...?

18:09.872 --> 18:11.021
Watch it.

18:12.156 --> 18:13.973
Clark? Richie?

18:13.975 --> 18:15.425
I hardly recognize you clowns

18:15.427 --> 18:16.994
without the underwear
on your head.

18:16.996 --> 18:19.062
Brad. Wow,
you have really

18:19.064 --> 18:20.914
not slimmed down.

18:20.916 --> 18:22.432
Oh. Eat me.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.636
So I heard from Jerry you tools
think you're athletes now.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.504
I didn't know "athlete"
had three syllables.

18:27.506 --> 18:28.538
"A-tha-lete."

18:28.540 --> 18:30.974
That's "ama-za-zing."

18:30.976 --> 18:34.311
You think you're hot shit
because you know words.

18:34.313 --> 18:35.712
Hey, Brad, why don't you
be a stud

18:35.714 --> 18:37.180
and point us toward
the register.

18:37.182 --> 18:40.100
Or "register-er."

18:40.102 --> 18:41.951
My team practices today at 5.

18:41.953 --> 18:44.187
<i>Swingby</i> if you she-men
wanna lose.

18:45.774 --> 18:48.358
Ho-ho-ho. You can't
handle the truth!

18:48.360 --> 18:49.693
Bring it!
Suck it!

18:49.695 --> 18:50.977
Oh.

18:57.201 --> 18:58.434
Gus!

18:59.136 --> 19:00.203
Gus!

19:01.589 --> 19:02.873
He can't hear us.

19:06.777 --> 19:08.311
Oh! Gah!

19:08.796 --> 19:10.229
Ow. Ah.

19:10.231 --> 19:11.230
Hey, fellas.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.200
You okay, Richie?

19:14.202 --> 19:15.201
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:15.203 --> 19:17.137
Just... purple nuts.

19:17.139 --> 19:19.355
Gus. we just had a run-in
with one of our old bullies

19:19.357 --> 19:20.941
over at the sporting
goods store.

19:20.943 --> 19:23.110
What happened?
He said we're still wussies,

19:23.112 --> 19:24.995
and he challenged
the three of us to a game.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.212
Don't know if
you can leave work.

19:26.214 --> 19:27.880
Course I can leave work.

19:27.882 --> 19:29.983
I'll mow this lawn later.
Let's take this guy down.

19:29.985 --> 19:32.118
I think I'm gonna puke.
Grab my arm.

19:33.822 --> 19:35.222
Bobby, this one's
coming for you.

19:35.224 --> 19:37.407
Focus and give us
a double play now.

19:37.409 --> 19:38.724
Let's go.
Turn two.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.895
Thattaway. Good job.

19:42.897 --> 19:44.564
Well, looks like
the Three Muske-queers

19:44.566 --> 19:46.049
decided to show up.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.884
Everybody, get your
butts in here.

19:47.886 --> 19:49.720
It's time for us
to scrimmage some losers.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.103
Yeah, we got
a "scrim-im-age ."

19:51.105 --> 19:52.104
Come on.

19:53.509 --> 19:54.474
Durrr.

19:54.476 --> 19:56.343
How the hell will this work
with three guys?

19:56.345 --> 19:58.445
We got a pitcher,
a catcher and a fielder.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.496
No, you've got
a retarded paperboy,

20:00.498 --> 20:02.099
a gay video clerk

20:02.101 --> 20:03.850
and a smelly midget.

20:03.852 --> 20:05.869
You wanna dance?
I'll dance on your face.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.105
Dance? We'll beat
your ass.

20:08.107 --> 20:10.256
Death to you.
Titty twister!

20:13.828 --> 20:16.579
My wife's the only one who'll
get to twist these man-titties.

20:18.015 --> 20:19.316
I just know you guys better...

20:19.318 --> 20:20.751
Better come ready to play!

20:23.320 --> 20:25.589
Gus is the new Jet Li.

20:25.591 --> 20:26.990
Bring it on!

20:26.992 --> 20:29.358
Hey, Dad, come down
to the field, quick.

20:31.246 --> 20:32.963
Ow!
Strike one!

20:32.965 --> 20:34.631
Ow!
Strike two!

20:35.934 --> 20:37.050
Strike three!

20:37.052 --> 20:38.885
Hey!
What? It slipped.

20:40.722 --> 20:41.972
Strike three!

20:41.974 --> 20:44.391
Hey!
What are you laughing at?

20:44.393 --> 20:46.059
He told me a joke.

20:49.231 --> 20:50.763
Let's go, Richie!
Oh, yeah.

20:51.882 --> 20:52.966
Hey, Dad,
come here. Look.

20:54.703 --> 20:55.852
You might wanna throw a fielder

20:55.854 --> 20:58.588
up in those mountains,
in case...

20:58.590 --> 21:00.190
ka-bang.

21:00.941 --> 21:02.542
What you got?
Strike!

21:02.544 --> 21:05.161
Pulled something.
Used to run track.

21:05.163 --> 21:05.962
Come on, Richie.

21:05.964 --> 21:07.948
Strike two!

21:07.950 --> 21:09.816
Nah, I didn't swing at that.

21:09.818 --> 21:11.551
Can't count it.

21:11.553 --> 21:13.386
Strike three!

21:15.723 --> 21:17.390
Could you tell him
to slow it down?

21:19.178 --> 21:20.543
Did you tell him?

21:23.732 --> 21:25.682
Ah!

21:25.684 --> 21:27.400
Here you go, Clark.
Thanks, Nelson.

21:27.402 --> 21:28.985
You're welcome.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.023
Whoa!

21:33.025 --> 21:34.324
Home run!

21:34.326 --> 21:35.859
Yeah!

21:35.861 --> 21:37.026
Yeah!

21:37.028 --> 21:39.362
Yeah! Did you see that?

21:39.364 --> 21:41.564
All right, you hit another homer!
Oh, yeah!

21:42.750 --> 21:44.267
<i>Howie! He just hit</i>
<i>a home run!</i>

21:44.269 --> 21:45.601
Whoo! Whoa!

21:55.429 --> 21:58.098
Strike one! Strike two!
Strike three!

21:58.100 --> 21:59.599
Can I get you a tennis racket?!

22:01.869 --> 22:03.770
No!

22:11.395 --> 22:13.563
Bravo, gentlemen. Bravo.

22:13.565 --> 22:14.397
Great game.

22:14.399 --> 22:15.732
Hey, thanks, Mel.

22:15.734 --> 22:16.816
Say, guys,

22:16.818 --> 22:19.385
I have this sensational idea
I wanna run by you.

22:19.387 --> 22:21.071
Ar-are you free
for lunch tomorrow?

22:21.073 --> 22:22.038
Uh, you know,

22:22.040 --> 22:24.607
I usually take lunch
from 12 to 4:30,

22:24.609 --> 22:26.543
so if it's in there
I could handle it.

22:26.545 --> 22:28.661
Tomorrow is egg salad day,

22:28.663 --> 22:31.047
but... I guess I could
double up on lunch.

22:31.049 --> 22:32.332
Gus, what do you think?

22:32.334 --> 22:34.217
One sounds good.
Great.

22:34.219 --> 22:37.637
I'm at 501 Shmegmer Street.

22:37.639 --> 22:38.671
See you then.

22:38.673 --> 22:39.555
See you, Nelson.
Bye.

22:39.557 --> 22:40.924
See you, Nelson.
Bye, guys.

22:40.926 --> 22:42.508
What do you think it's about?

22:42.510 --> 22:43.609
Dude, you're in trouble.

22:43.611 --> 22:44.677
Hey.
No way.

22:44.679 --> 22:46.646
You're definitely busted.

22:46.648 --> 22:49.182
I didn't do anything.
I swear!

22:50.151 --> 22:51.150
Huh. Ugh!

22:55.155 --> 22:57.274
- Whoa!
- This is it?

22:57.276 --> 22:58.658
I always wondered
who lived here.

22:58.660 --> 23:01.111
I just thought it was
Clay Aiken or something.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.279
<i>Who goes there?</i>

23:02.281 --> 23:03.879
Ha!
That is so cool!

23:03.881 --> 23:06.449
Hey, it's Gus, Clark and Richie.
We're here to see Mel.

23:06.451 --> 23:07.701
<i>You may enter.</i>

23:07.703 --> 23:08.618
Thanks, Darth.

23:08.620 --> 23:10.119
"Thanks, Darth."

23:10.121 --> 23:11.671
This place is sick, yo.

23:11.673 --> 23:14.708
This house must cost
a zillion dollars.

23:14.710 --> 23:16.809
Two zillion, actually.

23:16.811 --> 23:17.961
Hey, Mel.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.262
This place is incredible.

23:19.264 --> 23:20.229
Thank you, Gus.

23:20.231 --> 23:22.599
Gentlemen, welcome to
Chateau Shmegmer.

23:22.601 --> 23:25.184
Shall we adjourn to
the food quarters?

23:26.553 --> 23:27.937
Gentlemen...

23:27.939 --> 23:30.640
make yourselves at home.
Whoa.

23:30.642 --> 23:32.842
Yoda. R2!

23:34.780 --> 23:35.561
Number 7.

23:40.167 --> 23:42.201
<i>Lunch is ready when you are,</i>
<i>Mr. Carmichael.</i>

23:42.203 --> 23:43.369
Hey, Number 7.

23:43.371 --> 23:44.370
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

23:45.556 --> 23:46.639
Gentlemen, let's eat.

23:46.641 --> 23:47.824
Sit wherever you please.

23:51.045 --> 23:53.713
Gentlemen, order any
kind of sandwich you'd like.

23:53.715 --> 23:55.448
Number 7, thank you.

23:55.450 --> 23:57.183
I'll have
a peanut-butter-and-jelly

23:57.185 --> 23:59.652
sandwich...
with mayonnaise.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.490
Ta-da!

24:04.492 --> 24:06.226
Whoa.

24:06.228 --> 24:09.346
Can I have tuna fish
and Skittles...

24:09.348 --> 24:11.781
and pudding skin on wheat,

24:11.783 --> 24:12.899
with the crust cut off?

24:12.901 --> 24:14.684
<i>I guess so.</i>

24:19.458 --> 24:22.108
That was radical.

24:22.110 --> 24:24.777
All right, I got a crazy one
for you, Number 7.

24:24.779 --> 24:26.545
I'd like a turkey on white...

24:26.547 --> 24:27.580
Oh.

24:27.582 --> 24:29.449
He's good.

24:29.451 --> 24:31.668
So, what's on your mind, Mel?

24:31.670 --> 24:33.602
Gentlemen, it is time

24:33.604 --> 24:35.505
we brought this cause
into the public eye.

24:35.507 --> 24:36.790
What cause?

24:36.792 --> 24:39.075
The cause of the benchwarmers.

24:39.077 --> 24:41.044
The kids who warm the bench,

24:41.046 --> 24:42.128
while the others get to play

24:42.130 --> 24:43.346
and have all the fun.

24:43.348 --> 24:45.281
Now, all of us here
in this room

24:45.283 --> 24:48.084
have been excluded
from athletic activities.

24:48.086 --> 24:51.387
And now our kids are going
through the same tomfoolery.

24:51.389 --> 24:53.189
N-now, Richie,
do you have any kids?

24:53.191 --> 24:54.974
Never had a date.

24:54.976 --> 24:56.109
Clark?

24:56.111 --> 24:57.310
Never spoke to a girl.

24:57.312 --> 24:58.194
Gu...

25:01.081 --> 25:02.399
Gus?

25:02.401 --> 25:05.035
Uh, my wife and I are
kind of working on it.

25:05.037 --> 25:06.119
Well...

25:06.121 --> 25:07.586
when you do have them...

25:07.588 --> 25:11.124
you will know how painful
it is to see them sad.

25:11.126 --> 25:12.742
<i>Bonjour,</i> dudes.

25:12.744 --> 25:13.909
Hey, Nelson.
Hey, Nelson.

25:13.911 --> 25:15.478
How's it going?
There's my man.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.762
Son.
Yes.

25:16.764 --> 25:18.431
You, uh... You have
a little smear

25:18.433 --> 25:19.599
of something on your cheek.

25:21.802 --> 25:22.985
From a dog or a cat?

25:25.006 --> 25:26.739
I think it's a goat.

25:27.925 --> 25:30.126
Number 7,
some assistance, please.

25:36.083 --> 25:38.318
Thanks, Number 7.
You're my best friend.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.437
<i>As you are mine, Nelson.</i>

25:40.439 --> 25:41.487
That's so cool.

25:42.706 --> 25:44.607
<i>Ha, ha, ha.</i>

25:45.527 --> 25:46.826
Now, this is why I wanna start

25:46.828 --> 25:48.093
a round-robin
tournament

25:48.095 --> 25:50.863
with you three incredible men
playing against all

25:50.865 --> 25:53.833
the notoriously mean-spirited
teams of the state.

25:53.835 --> 25:55.535
But why us three?

25:55.537 --> 25:59.622
Because you know what it
feels like to be left out.

25:59.624 --> 26:02.158
You're three grown men who never
got to play baseball

26:02.160 --> 26:05.695
because you were weird and
smelled, and sat when you peed.

26:07.298 --> 26:09.182
Okay, the last one was just me.

26:09.184 --> 26:10.633
But you get my point.

26:10.635 --> 26:12.735
But why would any of these teams
agree to play

26:12.737 --> 26:14.036
in this tournament?

26:14.654 --> 26:16.105
Ah...

26:17.274 --> 26:18.775
For the prize.

26:25.599 --> 26:26.833
Whoa.

26:26.835 --> 26:27.667
Whoa.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.152
It's incredible.

26:29.154 --> 26:31.470
An official-size
stadium, modeled to scale,

26:31.472 --> 26:34.524
after all the greatest
ballparks in America.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.526
It's like Wrigley, Fenway
and Yankee Stadium.

26:36.528 --> 26:37.960
Nelson and his buddies

26:37.962 --> 26:40.380
have set up several
websites devoted to your team.

26:40.382 --> 26:43.866
You can go on Nerdly.net,
TheBenchwarmers.org,

26:43.868 --> 26:47.470
or Please-stop-with-the-shit-
tossing-it's-getting-old.com.

26:47.472 --> 26:49.088
Mel, w-why don't you
just build a stadium

26:49.090 --> 26:50.289
for Nelson and his buddies,

26:50.291 --> 26:51.758
and keep everybody else out?

26:51.760 --> 26:53.860
Because, Richie,
that won't solve anything.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.395
Yeah, Clark.

26:55.397 --> 26:57.463
If we can beat them
at their own game,

26:57.465 --> 27:00.199
then kids like Nelson and
his buddies will get respect.

27:02.102 --> 27:03.486
We'll do it.

27:03.488 --> 27:04.737
Come on.

27:04.739 --> 27:06.489
Benchwarmers on three.

27:06.491 --> 27:07.857
One, two, three.

27:07.859 --> 27:09.325
Benchwarmers!

27:09.327 --> 27:10.710
Excuse me, can I get a napkin?

27:10.712 --> 27:11.927
I spilled my ice cream.

27:11.929 --> 27:12.711
On the counter.

27:14.581 --> 27:16.533
Excuse me, sir.

27:16.535 --> 27:18.034
Are you Gus Matthews?
Eh. Ooh. Uh.

27:18.036 --> 27:20.520
Sorry. I spit a lot
when I speak.

27:20.522 --> 27:22.021
The people despise me for it.

27:22.023 --> 27:23.606
Uh, people spit.

27:23.608 --> 27:26.442
I mean, I... I spit
when I talk sometimes too, you know?

27:27.828 --> 27:30.496
My name is Sammy.
They call me Sammy Sprinkler.

27:30.498 --> 27:31.714
Pleased to meet you, Sammy.

27:31.716 --> 27:34.684
I'm Gus.
Gus Bus.

27:34.686 --> 27:36.436
Hey, if I come to a game,

27:36.438 --> 27:38.604
can I be your scorekeeper
and statistician?

27:38.606 --> 27:39.439
Certainly.

27:39.441 --> 27:41.224
Yes!

27:41.226 --> 27:43.292
All right.
See you later, Sammy.

27:43.294 --> 27:44.827
You're the man, Gus.
Peace out.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.863
All right.

27:46.865 --> 27:47.863
Who was that boy?

27:47.865 --> 27:49.299
Oh, I'm just seeing

27:49.301 --> 27:50.500
if he might be interested

27:50.502 --> 27:52.368
in babysitting our triplets
in a year or so.

27:52.370 --> 27:54.821
Why are you spitting on me?

27:54.823 --> 27:56.589
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

27:58.159 --> 27:59.792
This is idiotic.

27:59.794 --> 28:02.461
Are these guys serious about
this benchwarmer crap?

28:02.463 --> 28:03.746
It sounds like it.

28:03.748 --> 28:05.949
I'm not playing
in this stinking thing.

28:05.951 --> 28:07.750
Guys, if there weren't
nerds in the world,

28:07.752 --> 28:09.552
who would we throw crap at?

28:09.554 --> 28:10.853
No doubt.

28:10.855 --> 28:11.820
But what if we don't play,

28:11.822 --> 28:13.122
and they win it?

28:13.124 --> 28:15.725
They'll probably build
some weird nerd spaceship

28:15.727 --> 28:18.026
and fly it to...
To Planet Booger or something.

28:18.028 --> 28:19.027
I don't know.

28:21.049 --> 28:22.181
Now, guys,

28:22.183 --> 28:23.850
it's one-game
elimination.

28:23.852 --> 28:25.251
They're as good as done.

28:25.253 --> 28:27.319
You know what?
You're right.

28:27.321 --> 28:29.689
Let's strap it on,
and beat these three geeks,

28:29.691 --> 28:31.658
and win us a new stadium.

28:31.660 --> 28:32.659
Let's get it on!

28:36.314 --> 28:38.831
Dude, this green one is sweet.

28:38.833 --> 28:39.949
Oh, all right.
Okay.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.117
Whoa.

28:41.119 --> 28:42.952
We have a crowd, you guys.

28:42.954 --> 28:44.370
Excellent!

28:44.372 --> 28:45.954
Holy crap. What is
she doing here?

28:45.956 --> 28:47.206
Who is it?

28:47.208 --> 28:48.725
It's that salad chick
from Pizza Hut.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.960
She's so hot, it's sick.

28:50.962 --> 28:51.794
Hey, she's with me.

28:51.796 --> 28:52.795
You wish.

28:52.797 --> 28:54.062
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

28:54.064 --> 28:55.181
How you feeling?

28:55.183 --> 28:57.133
I just destroyed
that Porta-Potty,

28:57.135 --> 28:58.935
but I'm feeling better.

28:58.937 --> 28:59.852
Who did this?

29:01.690 --> 29:03.389
Ew.
Ew.

29:03.391 --> 29:04.857
Sorry!

29:04.859 --> 29:05.808
Oh.
Listen.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.060
I got a gift for you.

29:07.062 --> 29:08.361
Whoa!

29:08.363 --> 29:10.730
Never had my own
uniform before.

29:10.732 --> 29:12.982
Well, we can't have a team
without uniforms, right?

29:12.984 --> 29:14.317
I'm never taking this off.

29:14.319 --> 29:16.085
This is the coolest thing ever.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.737
This is the first game
of the tournament.

29:17.739 --> 29:19.371
Now, let's go
out there styling.

29:19.373 --> 29:20.039
Yeah!

29:20.041 --> 29:21.124
Nelson, you showed

29:21.126 --> 29:22.424
some serious
bat-retrieving

29:22.426 --> 29:23.425
skills last game.

29:23.427 --> 29:24.593
What do you say about being

29:24.595 --> 29:26.379
"the Benchwarmer"
official batboy?

29:26.381 --> 29:27.747
Uh... I...

29:27.749 --> 29:28.965
I...

29:28.967 --> 29:30.515
That means yes!

29:30.517 --> 29:31.433
All right!
All right.

29:31.435 --> 29:32.584
What are we waiting for?

29:32.586 --> 29:34.253
Let's kick some hairless ass!

29:36.257 --> 29:38.958
I had hair on my ass
before I could walk.

29:39.811 --> 29:41.060
This is it, kids.

29:41.062 --> 29:42.728
The Benchwarmers' quest
for a stadium

29:42.730 --> 29:43.829
is about to begin.

29:43.831 --> 29:45.281
Karl's!

29:45.283 --> 29:47.266
Karl's Auto
Body, the bad guys,

<i>have just taken the field</i>

29:48.603 --> 29:50.103

29:50.105 --> 29:52.155
<i>of Benchwarmers baseball.</i>

29:52.157 --> 29:54.357
<i>First to bat, Richie Goodman.</i>

29:54.359 --> 29:55.942
Fingers crossed.

29:55.944 --> 29:56.859
Come on, Richie.

29:56.861 --> 29:59.028
Easy out here.
Let's go.

29:59.030 --> 30:00.512
The pitcher pitches...

30:00.514 --> 30:01.748
Strike!

30:01.750 --> 30:03.015
I ticked it.

30:06.637 --> 30:08.037
I ticked it again.

30:10.207 --> 30:11.307
Strike!

30:11.309 --> 30:12.474
Ha-ha.

30:12.476 --> 30:13.909
Nice try, son.

30:13.911 --> 30:16.528
Whoo! Just fouled two in a row
in front of salad girl.

30:16.530 --> 30:17.630
Nice.

30:17.632 --> 30:18.831
Next up to bat...

30:18.833 --> 30:19.899
Clark Reedy.

30:21.201 --> 30:23.436
All right, Clark.
Here we go. You're the man.

30:28.142 --> 30:30.292
Those squirrels
are definitely out.

30:35.298 --> 30:36.232
Oh!

30:36.234 --> 30:37.416
Oh.

30:37.418 --> 30:39.801
That's my Miata!
Kill him!

30:42.791 --> 30:43.606
Hey, break it up!

30:44.875 --> 30:46.091
Why is this happening?

30:47.077 --> 30:48.995
Come on! Snap his femur!

30:48.997 --> 30:50.529
Richie! Help me!

30:51.481 --> 30:53.633
Help me!

30:53.635 --> 30:55.451
Mommy! Uh-huh-huh!

30:55.453 --> 30:56.118
Come on, Gus.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.119
We need it.

30:57.121 --> 30:58.271
You can do it.

30:58.273 --> 30:59.822
Big hitter.
Big hitter.

31:02.343 --> 31:03.325
Ho, ho! Ho!

31:07.348 --> 31:08.648
Home run!

31:08.650 --> 31:09.782
Yeah!
Yahoo!

31:17.024 --> 31:18.391
Strike!

31:23.081 --> 31:24.914
Strike!

31:32.088 --> 31:34.189
Another one!

31:34.191 --> 31:36.893
Oh, my God!

31:36.895 --> 31:38.227
Strike!

31:39.797 --> 31:40.963
Strike!

31:44.718 --> 31:45.668
Oh.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.237
Gus Bus! Gus Bus! Gus Bus!

31:49.239 --> 31:51.290
Gus Bus! Gus Bus!
Gus bus!

31:51.292 --> 31:52.859
This can't just be about me.

31:52.861 --> 31:55.228
I gotta get these guys
more involved.

31:55.230 --> 31:56.178
Look alive, Clark!

31:56.180 --> 31:58.114
I wanna go home.

31:58.116 --> 31:59.982
No. We need you,
buddy.

31:59.984 --> 32:02.235
No, you don't.
I'm awful.

32:02.237 --> 32:03.953
Come on, now.

32:03.955 --> 32:05.621
Let's go, Tommy!

32:05.623 --> 32:08.140
<i>This one's coming
right to you, Clark.</i>

32:11.995 --> 32:14.213
It's up! Clark!
Clark!

32:14.215 --> 32:15.264
Clark, look out!

32:20.704 --> 32:22.088
Attaboy! Good job!

32:22.090 --> 32:24.340
All right.
Good throw!

32:24.342 --> 32:25.958
Use your mitt, son,
not your head!

32:26.844 --> 32:28.077
Hm?

32:32.832 --> 32:34.851
Get it in here, pal!
Get it in here.

32:34.853 --> 32:37.453
Hold, hold, hold, hold.
Good job.

32:38.772 --> 32:40.872
Hey, Gus. Come on.
Let's end this.

32:40.874 --> 32:43.008
Two outs. Strike this kid out,
like before.

32:44.495 --> 32:46.195
A home run
here would tie it up,

32:46.197 --> 32:49.264
and could knock the Benchwarmers
out of the tournament.

32:51.035 --> 32:53.369
There we go! Nice!
Go! Run!

32:53.371 --> 32:54.437
Make the play, Clark!

32:55.388 --> 32:56.388
Clark, go!

32:58.343 --> 32:59.508
Ah!

33:00.578 --> 33:01.577
Pick up the ball!

33:02.862 --> 33:04.046
Run! Go!

33:04.048 --> 33:05.464
Go! Go! Go!

33:05.466 --> 33:06.799
Hey.

33:07.601 --> 33:09.852
Richie! Incoming!

33:09.854 --> 33:11.721
What did you say?
Ho!

33:11.723 --> 33:13.139
There we go! Nice! Go!

33:13.141 --> 33:14.524
Richie, get the ball!

33:14.526 --> 33:15.540
The ball?

33:16.893 --> 33:17.727
Ho!

33:19.563 --> 33:20.946
Behind you!

33:34.662 --> 33:35.760
You're out!

33:35.762 --> 33:36.579
Yeah!

33:39.333 --> 33:40.883
What are you doing?!

33:40.885 --> 33:42.685
Yes!

33:56.517 --> 33:57.717
Hey.

34:00.254 --> 34:01.954
Ah!

34:01.956 --> 34:04.056
I'm sorry, honey.
We had another game today,

34:04.058 --> 34:06.692
And I... I pulled a muscle
sliding into second base.

34:06.694 --> 34:07.910
You gotta be kidding me.

34:07.912 --> 34:09.110
It's all right, I was safe.

34:09.112 --> 34:12.164
Gus. We're trying
to start a family.

34:12.166 --> 34:14.033
I can't do it by myself.

34:14.034 --> 34:15.234
Well, I would hope not, uh,

34:15.235 --> 34:17.202
because that would make you
a hermaphrodite.

34:17.204 --> 34:18.504
We don't want that.

34:18.505 --> 34:21.257
I'm glad this is a big joke to you.
What?

34:21.259 --> 34:23.759
Honey, I was just
having a little fun.

34:23.761 --> 34:25.027
Come on. Don't go.

34:26.630 --> 34:30.032
Gentlemen, yesterday's
performance was phenomenal.

34:30.034 --> 34:31.132
All the online chat rooms

34:31.135 --> 34:33.601
are <i>exploding</i> with enthusiasm.

34:34.871 --> 34:35.971
Hey, Mel.

34:35.973 --> 34:37.773
Why aren't we out
practicing on the field?

34:37.775 --> 34:39.275
Well...

34:39.277 --> 34:41.226
I thought we could have
kind of a secret practice.

34:41.228 --> 34:43.612
Maybe become more
well-rounded as a unit.

34:43.614 --> 34:44.580
Nothing much.

34:44.581 --> 34:47.366
Hitting, running,
throwing, catching.

34:47.368 --> 34:48.333
Yeah, Clark.

34:48.335 --> 34:50.768
<i>Ha, ha, ha.</i>
<i>I heard you stunk.</i>

34:50.771 --> 34:52.071
Shut up, Number 7.

34:52.072 --> 34:53.322
You <i>shut up.</i>

34:53.324 --> 34:54.623
I'll kill you.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.859
I want you guys to meet
an old friend of mine,

34:56.860 --> 34:58.911
who knows a thing or two
about baseball.

34:58.913 --> 35:00.195
Ready when you are, buddy!

35:01.465 --> 35:02.614
Is that Mr. T?

35:02.616 --> 35:04.550
Dude, it's
Dr. Dre.

35:04.552 --> 35:05.885
No, no.

35:05.887 --> 35:08.170
That's <i>ReggieJackson.</i>

35:08.172 --> 35:10.306
Yeah, no. I don't know.

35:10.308 --> 35:13.408
Mr. October! Five hundred
and sixty-three home runs.

35:13.410 --> 35:15.044
Twice World Series MVP,

35:15.046 --> 35:17.112
where he spanked
four consecutive home runs.

35:17.114 --> 35:18.981
Three of them on three pitches.

35:18.983 --> 35:21.199
Reggie bar and I met at
tuba camp when we were kids.

35:24.221 --> 35:25.538
Ho-ho. Look at that.

35:25.540 --> 35:26.772
No. No way.

35:26.774 --> 35:27.990
That's you, Reggie?

35:27.992 --> 35:28.957
Why is that so funny?

35:28.959 --> 35:30.192
I was a cute kid.

35:30.194 --> 35:31.260
Oh. Absolutely.

35:31.262 --> 35:33.863
Uh... You're like
a young Denzel. I mean...

35:33.865 --> 35:36.165
I didn't know Denzel played Urkel.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.600
Reginator and I went through
some tough times together

35:38.602 --> 35:41.037
with bullies and
being picked on, and whatnot.

35:41.039 --> 35:42.838
I can't stand that stuff.

35:42.840 --> 35:43.906
Drives me crazy!

35:43.908 --> 35:44.874
Oh.
Crazy!

35:44.876 --> 35:46.258
Easy, buddy.
Easy.

35:49.162 --> 35:51.513
Anyway, I told
Reggie-Reggie-Oxen-Free

35:51.515 --> 35:53.515
we're having problems
with our fundamentals,

35:53.517 --> 35:55.985
and he agreed to come
and help us run some drills.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.219
Isn't that great?

35:57.221 --> 35:58.954
We'll do the same drills
that I did

35:58.956 --> 36:00.906
when I was a kid
learning to play baseball.

36:00.908 --> 36:02.624
<i>All right.</i>

36:02.626 --> 36:04.126
Hey, so whose house is this?

36:04.128 --> 36:05.161
Shh.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.495
This is to teach you speed.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.447
How is standing here
gonna teach us speed?

36:08.449 --> 36:09.915
What are you doing?
Where's he going?

36:09.917 --> 36:11.249
Hey. Run.
Why? Wh... Oh!

36:11.251 --> 36:12.318
Don't go.

36:12.320 --> 36:13.885
- Reggie, you're nuts!
- Guys?

36:13.887 --> 36:14.987
Go, go.
Go!

36:14.989 --> 36:16.554
Who in the hell is it?!

36:16.556 --> 36:18.623
I was freaking sleeping!

36:19.943 --> 36:22.044
<i>Nobody</i> messes with me.

36:22.046 --> 36:23.679
I will rip your throat out!

36:23.681 --> 36:25.748
Do you hear me?!

36:25.750 --> 36:28.751
And I <i>will find you!</i>

36:29.937 --> 36:32.304
You're in the bushes!

36:32.306 --> 36:33.139
Yah!

36:34.575 --> 36:36.424
I'm sorry!

36:36.426 --> 36:38.210
I'm sorry!
Go back to sleep!

36:38.212 --> 36:39.545
Ow. Ow!

36:46.454 --> 36:47.837
Come on, guys, let's go.
Come on. Run.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.254
Run, run.

36:55.162 --> 36:57.562
Whoo!

36:58.748 --> 37:00.282
Who's there?

37:00.284 --> 37:02.585
You'd better run,
you smart alecks!

37:02.587 --> 37:03.819
Who is it, Brad?

37:03.821 --> 37:05.320
Ah, just a bunch of punks...

37:05.322 --> 37:07.339
who better watch their backs!

37:07.341 --> 37:09.258
Relax, smarty pants.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.177
Let's finish the massage.

37:11.179 --> 37:12.595
Brad have a pool?

37:12.597 --> 37:14.063
I don't think so.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.066
Yeah, I... I guess
you're right.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.901
Oh, you little devil.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.970
I'm gonna get you.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.138
Nightmares.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.889
This next drill, boys,

37:23.891 --> 37:26.341
is for your catch-
and-quick-release skills.

37:26.343 --> 37:27.476
All right.
Hah.

37:28.928 --> 37:29.911
Hot potato!

37:29.913 --> 37:31.647
Ooh! Ow, oh, oh, oh.

37:31.649 --> 37:33.932
No! Ah, ah,
ah, ah!

37:33.934 --> 37:36.068
Excellent, Clark.

37:36.070 --> 37:37.169
Clark, let it go!

37:41.124 --> 37:42.491
Throw it!
Get rid of it!

37:42.493 --> 37:43.609
Come on, let it go!

37:43.611 --> 37:44.743
Release!

37:44.745 --> 37:46.011
Release! Release!

37:47.514 --> 37:48.764
<i>Ooh. Ow.</i>

37:51.183 --> 37:52.184
<i>Ooh. W-wha...?</i>

37:52.186 --> 37:53.502
Uh... Ooh.

37:55.173 --> 37:56.305
<i>Um, sorry.</i>

37:57.091 --> 37:58.290
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

37:58.758 --> 38:01.026
<i>Ah. Well...</i>

38:01.028 --> 38:03.628
The final drill is
for hand-eye coordination.

38:03.630 --> 38:04.897
Hit it, Mel!

38:04.899 --> 38:06.098
Oogaty-boogaty-boogaty!

38:06.100 --> 38:07.850
Let's go racing!

38:09.320 --> 38:10.653
Ohh!

38:10.655 --> 38:12.020
Look at that!

38:12.022 --> 38:13.421
Excellent!
That's insane.

38:14.374 --> 38:15.540
Yeah, baby!

38:15.542 --> 38:17.243
You got it, buddy. Oh!

38:17.245 --> 38:18.360
That's my friend!

38:20.697 --> 38:22.948
Whoa!
Oh, Reggie.

38:22.950 --> 38:23.782
Give me the bat.

38:23.784 --> 38:25.701
Gus Bus! Gus Bus!

38:25.703 --> 38:28.037
Gus Bus! Gus Bus!
Gus Bus!

38:30.324 --> 38:32.174
Thattaway to go.

38:32.176 --> 38:33.425
Don't fall.
Come on!

38:33.427 --> 38:34.877
You got it. You can do it.

38:34.879 --> 38:35.761
Hit it, baby!

38:38.132 --> 38:39.097
Man, you can do it.

38:39.099 --> 38:40.082
You can do it.

38:40.084 --> 38:41.767
Let me see it.

38:41.769 --> 38:42.918
Ahh!

38:42.920 --> 38:45.638
Clark, you're lucky
I'm a billionaire.

38:47.208 --> 38:48.891
<i>The score is all tied up.</i>

38:48.893 --> 38:49.992
The bottom of the sixth.

38:49.994 --> 38:53.011
This is the Benchwarmers
closest battle yet.

38:53.013 --> 38:54.647
Ow!
Strike.

38:54.649 --> 38:55.948
All right, Clark.

38:55.950 --> 38:57.382
See the ball, be the ball.

38:58.968 --> 39:00.653
- Oh!
- Strike two!

39:00.655 --> 39:01.637
Clark just made contact.

39:01.639 --> 39:03.388
With his own head.

39:03.390 --> 39:04.830
Grab real tight and concen...

39:05.492 --> 39:06.825
Whoa!

39:06.827 --> 39:09.394
Hey! Shee.

39:10.580 --> 39:11.847
Better distance that time.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.382
Thanks.
Yeah.

39:13.384 --> 39:14.800
Richie's coming up.

39:14.802 --> 39:16.468
The Benchwarmers really
need a hit here.

39:16.470 --> 39:18.520
All right, Richie, here we go.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.556
She's way out of your league.

39:20.558 --> 39:21.690
What's that?

39:21.692 --> 39:23.391
You're probably
a 39-year-old virgin.

39:23.393 --> 39:24.893
Women don't think
that's too cute.

39:26.147 --> 39:27.112
Shouldn't you be at home,

39:27.114 --> 39:28.947
like, combing your doll's hair?

39:28.949 --> 39:30.765
Shouldn't you be at home
blowing a doll up?

39:30.767 --> 39:32.134
Because that's the only action

39:32.136 --> 39:33.819
a tool like you
is ever gonna get.

39:33.821 --> 39:34.737
Ugh.

39:37.173 --> 39:40.259
Take it out on the ball,
not his head.

39:40.261 --> 39:41.527
Mm!

39:46.583 --> 39:47.666
Ho!
Yeah!

39:47.668 --> 39:49.668
Run! Run!

39:50.755 --> 39:52.288
Move your ass, Richie!

39:52.290 --> 39:53.872
Huh. Ahh.

39:53.874 --> 39:54.807
Run, Richie, run!

39:54.809 --> 39:56.308
You got it! Way to run!

39:56.310 --> 39:57.876
Come on. Go!

39:57.878 --> 39:59.194
Go! Go! Go!

39:59.196 --> 40:01.380
Go! Go! Go!

40:01.382 --> 40:03.799
Slide if you have to!

40:03.801 --> 40:06.117
He's rounding
third and heading for home!

40:06.119 --> 40:07.503
Bring it, dork.

40:12.643 --> 40:14.143
Oh.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.277
Oh!
Ha-ho!

40:18.699 --> 40:20.532
Touch home plate!
Touch home plate!

40:20.534 --> 40:21.433
Richie, touch home!

40:23.871 --> 40:25.170
Safe!

40:25.172 --> 40:27.155
He scores! Benchwarmers win!

40:27.157 --> 40:29.191
It's a miracle!
It's a miracle!

40:29.193 --> 40:30.960
Whoo! I ain't
no virgin now.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.996
To home runs, beyotch!

40:41.254 --> 40:42.654
<i>Benchwarmers win a close one</i>

40:42.656 --> 40:43.822
<i>on Richie's first home run</i>

40:43.824 --> 40:45.624
<i>in the history of the universe.</i>

40:45.626 --> 40:47.793
<i>We'll see you in game three.</i>

40:47.795 --> 40:48.710
Excuse me.
I never hit it.

40:48.712 --> 40:50.045
Can we have your autographs?

40:50.047 --> 40:51.329
Are you serious?

40:51.331 --> 40:53.231
- What?
- Yeah, you can.

40:53.233 --> 40:54.015
All right.

40:54.017 --> 40:55.684
Write my name
right here on the ball?

40:55.686 --> 40:58.520
Uh, you see that home run?
Tell your sister about it.

40:58.522 --> 41:01.240
Wait. Do you need
my address too?

41:01.242 --> 41:03.025
Oh, you guys are
making some noise.

41:03.027 --> 41:05.911
This is music to my ear hair.

41:05.913 --> 41:08.747
My dad has ear hair.
It's pretty scary.

41:08.749 --> 41:11.033
Wait. Is "badass"
one or two words?

41:11.035 --> 41:12.917
- That's pretty good.
- Just the beginning.

41:14.203 --> 41:15.320
How do they keep winning?!

41:15.322 --> 41:17.839
These guys are a bunch of
turd nuggets!

41:17.841 --> 41:18.840
Who wants to wrestle?

41:18.842 --> 41:20.008
I'm in.

41:20.010 --> 41:21.009
All right.

41:21.011 --> 41:22.477
I'm good.
I'm good.

41:22.479 --> 41:23.478
Gotcha.

41:24.598 --> 41:26.097
Howie, listen to me.

41:26.099 --> 41:27.399
They're not gonna kill you.

41:27.401 --> 41:29.551
They're dropping off
the cookies I ordered.

41:29.553 --> 41:31.136
They look very aggressive.

41:32.939 --> 41:34.556
Think they want to beat me up.

41:34.558 --> 41:35.558
Trust me, you'll be fine.

41:35.559 --> 41:38.793
Just take the Thin Mints
back into the apartment.

41:38.795 --> 41:40.295
That's our food for the week.

41:40.297 --> 41:42.264
Fine. You can eat
the Thin Mints

41:42.266 --> 41:43.832
at my funeral, Richie.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.328
Hot. Hot.

41:56.330 --> 41:57.679
Hot sun.

42:03.435 --> 42:04.502
Huh. Cookie.

42:07.573 --> 42:09.892
Sun, bad. Sun, bad!

42:14.380 --> 42:15.631
Excuse me?

42:17.184 --> 42:18.200
Hey.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.468
Are you okay?

42:19.470 --> 42:21.336
How you doing? Yeah.
It's, uh... Wrong pipe.

42:21.338 --> 42:23.405
No biggie.
Um, what's going on?

42:23.407 --> 42:25.157
Um... Just returning
these movies.

42:25.159 --> 42:27.642
Oh. Hey. Well,
I'm the management.

42:27.644 --> 42:29.478
So I'm gonna waive
the late fee.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.029
Oh. They're
not late.

42:31.031 --> 42:32.831
But thank you.

42:32.833 --> 42:34.616
Oh. Well, anything
you want

42:34.618 --> 42:36.952
in the store is free too, so...

42:36.954 --> 42:39.821
I'm Sarah, and this is
my brother, Jarrett.

42:39.823 --> 42:42.091
He's a huge fan of yours
and the Benchwarmers.

42:42.093 --> 42:44.343
Oh, wow. Cool.

42:44.345 --> 42:45.878
Thanks for cheering
us on. Uh...

42:45.880 --> 42:47.763
Hey, what does "beyotch" mean?

42:47.765 --> 42:50.098
Oh. Uh...
That's, uh...

42:50.100 --> 42:52.800
That means, uh,
"good game" in Swedlandia.

42:52.802 --> 42:54.252
Well, we'll let you
get back to work.

42:54.254 --> 42:55.453
Oh. Okay.
But, uh...

42:55.455 --> 42:57.940
Eh, maybe I'll see you
at another game, hopefully?

42:57.942 --> 43:00.058
Yeah.
Definitely.

43:00.060 --> 43:01.159
All right.
See you, Jarrett.

43:01.161 --> 43:02.594
Beyotch yesterday.

43:05.181 --> 43:07.866
Marty, what do you think
of my future wife?

43:07.868 --> 43:11.069
I smell cinnamon rolls.

43:11.071 --> 43:13.605
Oh, I smell cinnamon rolls too.

43:15.058 --> 43:17.576
Gentlemen, check it out.

43:17.578 --> 43:19.310
Whoa. Nerd
headquarters.

43:19.312 --> 43:21.580
Never felt more comfortable
in my life.

43:21.582 --> 43:23.347
Hey, guys. Take
a gander at these.

43:23.349 --> 43:24.967
We made your own
baseball cards.

43:24.969 --> 43:26.919
- Get out of here.
- Oh! Give me that.

43:26.921 --> 43:27.986
Cool.
Let me see this.

43:27.988 --> 43:28.887
What?

43:28.889 --> 43:30.405
They got statistics.

43:30.407 --> 43:32.341
I hit 30 home runs.

43:32.343 --> 43:33.474
Ha-ha. I got
11 foul ticks.

43:33.476 --> 43:34.943
I have 20 eyes-closed
strikeouts,

43:34.945 --> 43:37.412
five broken windshields
and six dead birds.

43:37.414 --> 43:39.181
I'm freaking awesome.

43:39.183 --> 43:40.298
Now, listen up.

43:40.300 --> 43:42.851
Brookdale and Candia
both advanced today.

43:42.853 --> 43:45.187
So we have to beat them
to make it to the semifinals.

43:45.189 --> 43:48.023
Unfortunately, it is
on their own home turf.

43:48.025 --> 43:50.159
So we're gonna have to hit
the road for a few days.

43:50.161 --> 43:51.660
Did you say Brookdale?

43:51.662 --> 43:53.228
Yeah, aren't you
<i>from</i> Brookdale?

43:53.230 --> 43:54.179
Yeah.

43:54.181 --> 43:55.430
Oh, that's great.
All right.

43:55.432 --> 43:57.532
We'll have a big
welcome-home party for you, Gus.

43:57.534 --> 43:58.951
No!

43:58.953 --> 44:01.519
I mean, um,
i-it's all right. I...

44:01.521 --> 44:03.422
I lost contact
with everybody there.

44:03.424 --> 44:05.474
Wait, so we're
staying overnight?

44:05.476 --> 44:07.793
Does my mother have to sign
a permission slip?

44:07.795 --> 44:09.944
Uh, no. But we will
have to change your diaper.

44:11.197 --> 44:13.048
Seriously, it's been
three days.

44:13.050 --> 44:14.883
Sweetheart, I just found out

44:14.885 --> 44:16.150
I have to leave town this week

44:16.152 --> 44:17.952
for a landscaping convention.

44:17.954 --> 44:20.522
You never mentioned
a landscaping convention before.

44:20.524 --> 44:22.641
I know. This is
the first one.

44:22.643 --> 44:24.592
My ovulation schedule
has been delayed three days

44:24.594 --> 44:25.994
because of
the full moon anyway,

44:25.996 --> 44:28.330
so... it's okay.

44:28.332 --> 44:29.448
Hey, Gussie.

44:29.450 --> 44:31.817
Imagine if we had a boy first,

44:31.819 --> 44:32.834
and he grew up to be smart

44:32.836 --> 44:35.537
and sweet and handsome.

44:35.539 --> 44:38.072
Or imagine he's only
3 feet tall.

44:38.074 --> 44:40.742
And everybody in the school
calls him Midget Boy or Yoda.

44:40.744 --> 44:41.876
And then, just for fun,

44:41.878 --> 44:43.745
they throw him into
a bunch of bowling pins

44:43.747 --> 44:46.414
and laugh until they pee
all over themselves.

44:48.084 --> 44:50.335
Were you Midget Boy or Yoda?

44:50.337 --> 44:51.886
I don't wanna talk about it.

44:51.888 --> 44:54.022
Just make some room, honey.
I gotta take a leak.

44:57.695 --> 45:00.178
Oh, my God, you're not kidding!
Gus, stop it!

45:10.189 --> 45:12.056
Mel is officially insane.

45:13.910 --> 45:16.194
Oh, my God.

45:17.764 --> 45:19.831
Right?

45:19.833 --> 45:20.899
Gus, how sick is this?

45:20.901 --> 45:23.534
It sleeps five, and
it's got Playstation.

45:23.536 --> 45:25.704
Yeah, and check out the fridge.
It's full of sweets.

45:25.706 --> 45:27.338
I'm already on
my third candy bar.

45:27.340 --> 45:28.673
Oh, man.

45:28.675 --> 45:30.542
Mm. Mother would not
approve of this.

45:30.544 --> 45:31.627
That's creepy.

45:31.629 --> 45:32.627
Ow!

45:32.629 --> 45:34.046
What the hell is that?

45:34.048 --> 45:35.213
That's just Howie.

45:35.215 --> 45:36.348
Howie?

45:36.350 --> 45:38.383
You left the house.
Good for you.

45:38.385 --> 45:40.535
Richie told me about the killer
in the neighborhood.

45:40.537 --> 45:42.203
He's killing anyone
named Howie.

45:42.205 --> 45:45.607
That's my name.
That's <i>my</i> name.

45:45.609 --> 45:46.489
We'll just go with it.

45:47.393 --> 45:49.194
Nelson!
Hey, there he is.

45:49.196 --> 45:51.513
Let's go, boys. We gotta
be in Candia by 2:00.

45:51.515 --> 45:52.864
Oh, FYI:

45:52.866 --> 45:54.048
This team we're playing today

45:54.050 --> 45:56.568
is notorious for egging
comic-book conventions.

45:56.570 --> 45:58.153
Destroy them!

45:58.155 --> 45:59.905
Oh, Howie. You're a freak.

45:59.907 --> 46:02.407
Edgar, let's get
this Gus Bus on the road.

46:02.409 --> 46:04.309
<i>It's Game three.</i>

46:04.311 --> 46:06.878
<i>Benchwarmers vs. Standard Fence</i>
<i>at Candia City Park.</i>

46:08.598 --> 46:09.347
Are we here?
Losers!

46:10.433 --> 46:11.833
I think we are.

46:11.835 --> 46:13.351
It's the sixth inning,

46:13.353 --> 46:15.036
and the Benchwarmers
are down by one run,

46:15.038 --> 46:16.505
with Clark Reedy up on deck.

46:19.310 --> 46:20.592
Clark... hold the bat.

46:20.594 --> 46:22.427
Wait. Why?

46:22.429 --> 46:24.146
Good. Really good.
What are you doing?

46:24.148 --> 46:25.630
Oh. I see.
It's gonna be great.

46:27.100 --> 46:29.167
Hey, Richie.
I look like a mummy.

46:32.106 --> 46:34.239
God, it worked!
Clark got a hit!

46:34.241 --> 46:35.524
Awesome!

46:35.526 --> 46:36.325
The other way!

46:36.327 --> 46:37.326
Come on, run it out!

46:39.946 --> 46:42.030
Let's go! Yeah!

46:42.032 --> 46:45.367
And Richie scores!
That ties it up, four to four!

46:45.369 --> 46:47.085
Whoo! I made it!
I made it! Yeah! Yeah!

46:47.087 --> 46:49.121
Clark...
bend down.

47:02.553 --> 47:04.269
What the heck was that?

47:04.271 --> 47:05.554
Excellent.
I mean, come on!

47:05.556 --> 47:06.805
What a moron!

47:06.807 --> 47:08.440
Huh? Ahh!

47:08.442 --> 47:09.541
Ha... Ho!

47:12.245 --> 47:14.730
The ball gets
away from the catcher!

47:14.732 --> 47:16.064
Gus goes to second!

47:17.401 --> 47:18.900
Go! He missed it!

47:18.902 --> 47:20.569
Hey! What the...?

47:20.571 --> 47:21.903
Let go!

47:23.707 --> 47:24.740
Go, Gus, go!

47:24.742 --> 47:27.325
You got it!
Come on, over here! Third!

47:27.327 --> 47:29.007
I got it. I got it.
You got it. You got it.

47:30.079 --> 47:31.980
Get the ball!
Get the ball! Home!

47:31.982 --> 47:32.880
Get up!
Get up!

47:32.882 --> 47:34.666
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Yeah!

47:37.538 --> 47:38.870
Ooh, it burns.

47:38.872 --> 47:40.055
Oh. It burns.

47:40.057 --> 47:40.922
Hot.

47:40.924 --> 47:43.725
Hot. It burns.
It burns.

47:43.727 --> 47:45.910
<i>And the Benchwarmers</i>
<i>win it, 5-4.</i>

47:54.187 --> 47:56.270
Look at all these people.
We're like the Beatles.

47:56.272 --> 47:57.823
Or Wham!

47:57.825 --> 47:59.791
Get your
Benchwarmers' souvenirs.

47:59.793 --> 48:01.776
Slide rules,
pocket protectors, pennants.

48:01.778 --> 48:03.161
Everything you need.

48:03.163 --> 48:05.530
Welcome to
Brookdale for game four.

48:05.532 --> 48:07.782
Benchwarmers baseball
is on the internet.

48:09.185 --> 48:11.453
Coach Bellows, Gus Matthews
from the Benchwarmers.

48:11.455 --> 48:12.854
Shake hands
and have a good game.

48:12.856 --> 48:14.823
All right.
Gus Matthews. Sounds familiar.

48:14.825 --> 48:15.957
You from around here?

48:15.959 --> 48:18.059
Uh, no.

48:18.061 --> 48:20.361
I grew up on, uh,
the North Pole.

48:20.363 --> 48:22.230
Uh, not even close to here.

48:23.466 --> 48:25.216
And here's the pitch.

48:26.018 --> 48:27.969
It's a high fly ball!

48:35.611 --> 48:37.278
Oh.

48:41.118 --> 48:44.402
Bad news.
The Benchwarmers are behind, 2-0.

48:44.404 --> 48:47.122
Gus is up. Clark's on third.

48:47.124 --> 48:48.924
Gus! Gus! Gus!
Gus! Gus! Gus!

48:50.660 --> 48:52.410
And he smacked that one.

48:52.412 --> 48:54.212
Oh.

48:54.214 --> 48:56.330
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

48:56.332 --> 48:58.049
No.
Relax.

48:58.051 --> 49:00.418
This game is all tied up.

49:11.097 --> 49:12.347
Yeah.

49:12.349 --> 49:13.682
Richie hit
a four-footer.

49:13.684 --> 49:15.016
Let's go, Richie!

49:15.018 --> 49:16.685
Run it out! Run! Run it out!

49:16.687 --> 49:17.986
Get there! Run it out!

49:17.988 --> 49:19.254
Get there! He's safe!

49:19.256 --> 49:20.555
He's safe! He's safe!

49:29.198 --> 49:30.499
Way to go!
Run it out!

49:30.501 --> 49:31.783
He's rounding third.

49:33.586 --> 49:35.186
Richie scores!

49:35.188 --> 49:37.705
Uh-oh. Clark overran
third base.

49:39.425 --> 49:40.542
Safe!

49:40.544 --> 49:41.793
Yeah!

49:41.795 --> 49:43.512
Richie! Richie! Richie!

49:43.514 --> 49:44.763
Too high.

49:44.765 --> 49:47.048
Bad idea. Call 911!

49:47.050 --> 49:49.534
That was a close one.
Benchwarmers, 3-2.

49:49.536 --> 49:52.220
Brookdale Glass is shattered.

49:52.222 --> 49:53.371
Hey, could we
please leave, Mel?

49:53.373 --> 49:54.973
What? Oh.
Yeah, sure.

49:54.975 --> 49:56.574
Gus!

49:59.278 --> 50:01.062
Gus. Maybe this'll
relax you.

50:01.064 --> 50:02.964
Fresh off the presses
of <i>The Daily Shmegmer.</i>

50:02.966 --> 50:04.649
Oh, we're on the front page.
No way.

50:04.651 --> 50:06.568
"Benchwarmers Get Hizzot

50:06.570 --> 50:08.987
and Rizoll
Into Semi-Fizinals."

50:08.989 --> 50:11.289
Mel, if my wife sees this,
I'm totally busted.

50:11.291 --> 50:12.991
Do not fret, my good man.

50:12.993 --> 50:16.244
Number 7 is covering
Clark's paper route.

50:22.718 --> 50:24.519
Problem solved, Gus.

50:28.058 --> 50:30.525
Welcome to the semifinals
of Mel's tournament.

50:30.527 --> 50:33.728
Only Wayne's Hardware stands
between the Benchwarmers

50:33.730 --> 50:34.512
and the final game.

50:34.514 --> 50:36.014
Meanwhile, the nerd fans

50:36.016 --> 50:37.581
are attempting
their first wave ever.

50:39.269 --> 50:40.918
Hey, Jerry, what's going on?

50:40.920 --> 50:42.554
Who's this?

50:42.556 --> 50:44.656
I wanted you guys
to have a little edge today,

50:44.658 --> 50:46.407
so I brought my friend, Carlos.

50:46.409 --> 50:48.442
He is from
the Dominican Republic,

50:48.444 --> 50:50.912
and he is one incredible
ballplayer.

50:50.914 --> 50:51.829
Carlos. That's great.

50:51.831 --> 50:53.531
Uh... how old are you?

50:53.533 --> 50:54.783
I am 12.

50:54.785 --> 50:57.002
More like 1200.

50:57.004 --> 50:59.670
Check my birth certificate.

50:59.672 --> 51:01.306
He's legit.

51:04.611 --> 51:06.411
You're kidding.
This is green crayon.

51:06.413 --> 51:08.546
<i>Papi. Papi.</i>

51:08.548 --> 51:10.548
<i>Silencio, mijo.</i>

51:10.550 --> 51:11.833
That's your kid?

51:13.185 --> 51:14.986
Well, anyways, look,
thanks a lot, Jerry,

51:14.988 --> 51:15.987
but my team kicks ass.

51:15.989 --> 51:17.639
I think we'll be fine.

51:17.641 --> 51:19.040
Well, he's here
if you need him.

51:20.410 --> 51:22.444
I need a refill.

51:22.446 --> 51:24.028
You need to go to
an AA meeting.

51:25.314 --> 51:27.649
No, really.
I need a refill.

51:30.988 --> 51:32.270
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

51:35.042 --> 51:36.324
Here. Hold this.

51:40.497 --> 51:42.029
Look, a vampire.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.750
Whoo!

51:45.752 --> 51:48.369
Whoo!

51:49.772 --> 51:51.489
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

51:57.397 --> 51:58.312
Strike three!

52:02.985 --> 52:04.602
It's a hit parade!

52:11.694 --> 52:13.928
Time out!

52:13.930 --> 52:16.197
It's about time. Go. You're in,
you're in. Give me that.

52:20.402 --> 52:23.254
Come on, <i>hombre.</i>
We need <i>mucho</i> home run-o's.

52:30.780 --> 52:32.097
Ohh!

52:32.099 --> 52:34.215
Whoa. Dude,
you smell like beer.

52:34.217 --> 52:35.850
You look like beer.

52:35.852 --> 52:37.552
Hey. Who the hell's
this guy?

52:37.554 --> 52:38.470
Sorry.

52:38.472 --> 52:39.537
Is he on your roster?

52:39.539 --> 52:41.005
Uh, yeah, of course.

52:41.007 --> 52:43.324
He wasn't feeling well earlier,
so I couldn't play him.

52:43.326 --> 52:45.694
<i>Mi</i> tummy <i>es</i> sick-o.

52:45.696 --> 52:48.480
This guy's 50.
He's got a mustache.

52:48.482 --> 52:50.231
Not according to birth
"certifico."

52:56.972 --> 52:59.023
He's got documentation. Come on.

52:59.025 --> 53:00.208
Play ball!

53:09.836 --> 53:12.220
Get out of here, baby!
Get out of here, baby!

53:12.222 --> 53:13.471
Yeah!

53:19.661 --> 53:21.513
Oh, shit.

53:21.515 --> 53:24.181
Howie. Listen.
Take this money,

53:24.183 --> 53:26.735
go buy beer and tequila,
and come right back.

53:26.737 --> 53:29.104
He'll go. Don't be scared.
I don't wanna do that.

53:29.106 --> 53:30.404
No, no.
Go, go, go. Go, go, go.

53:30.406 --> 53:31.639
Nelson.

53:31.641 --> 53:32.874
You're all right.

53:35.377 --> 53:37.362
Strike three!

53:42.701 --> 53:44.953
You gotta step in
the batter's box.

53:45.871 --> 53:47.738
I'm gonna kill your family.

53:51.461 --> 53:52.460
Yes!

53:54.696 --> 53:56.097
Ohh!

53:56.099 --> 53:57.482
Yeah!
Gone!

53:58.467 --> 54:01.151
Looks like the Gus Bus
is out of gas.

54:02.304 --> 54:03.254
I got it!
I got it!

54:07.359 --> 54:09.560
Let's go! That's what
I'm talking about! Like that!

54:16.653 --> 54:18.219
It's the third inning,

54:18.221 --> 54:20.822
and the Benchwarmers
cling to a one-run lead.

54:20.824 --> 54:22.757
Your hair is like a waterfall.

54:22.759 --> 54:24.191
Mm. Thank you.
Mm.

54:24.193 --> 54:25.426
Carlos.

54:25.428 --> 54:27.095
Who say my name?

54:28.680 --> 54:30.798
This is a present
from the Benchwarmers.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.251
You're really good
at baseball. Awesome.

54:33.253 --> 54:35.920
<i>Gracias,</i> albino.
Now get lost!

54:39.676 --> 54:42.493
Two outs and the
Benchwarmers hanging on, 6-5.

54:51.354 --> 54:52.320
<i>Qué!</i>

54:52.322 --> 54:53.321
Go, go, go!
Gus, go!

55:09.071 --> 55:10.037
Safe!

55:10.039 --> 55:11.256
Yes!
Yes! He did it!

55:11.258 --> 55:12.407
He did it!
He did it!

55:12.409 --> 55:13.224
No way! God!

55:15.544 --> 55:16.594
What?

55:16.596 --> 55:19.180
He was out!

55:19.182 --> 55:21.516
Ow. My hand. Agh.

55:21.518 --> 55:24.969
Top of the sixth.
Benchwarmers leading, 7-5.

55:24.971 --> 55:27.972
That looks rough, dude.
Is it broken?

55:27.974 --> 55:28.973
It's not broken,

55:28.975 --> 55:30.441
but I definitely can't pitch.

55:30.443 --> 55:31.609
Richie, can you pitch?

55:31.611 --> 55:33.244
Hell, no, dude.
I can't even catch.

55:33.246 --> 55:35.230
My vote is to have Clark
the new pitcher.

55:35.232 --> 55:37.899
Wait. Why me?
Because you throw newspapers.

55:37.901 --> 55:39.567
You have to have
some kind of arm.

55:39.569 --> 55:41.402
Come on, come on.
Let's go, guys.

55:41.404 --> 55:42.737
Clark, we have no other choice.

55:42.739 --> 55:45.156
Wh... What are you gonna do?

55:45.158 --> 55:46.274
I'll play the outfield.

55:46.276 --> 55:47.942
I can still catch pop flies.

55:48.810 --> 55:50.261
I'll try.

55:52.299 --> 55:53.998
I wonder if Clark
ever pitched before.

55:56.535 --> 55:57.802
Nope.

55:57.804 --> 55:59.470
Come on, really burn it in.

55:59.472 --> 56:00.738
Yeah.

56:01.790 --> 56:03.024
Ball three.

56:03.809 --> 56:05.392
Come on.

56:05.394 --> 56:07.145
Ball four. Take your base.

56:07.147 --> 56:09.514
Two-run lead.
Bases are loaded.

56:09.516 --> 56:11.382
And Carlos is coming up.

56:15.739 --> 56:17.405
One run scores.

56:19.993 --> 56:21.959
The tying run scores.

56:26.415 --> 56:29.567
Here comes the lead run.
And he is...

56:30.335 --> 56:31.502
Out!

56:31.504 --> 56:33.705
Oh, my God!
What a play!

56:35.375 --> 56:38.176
We go to the
bottom of the last inning,

56:38.178 --> 56:39.844
and it's all tied up.

56:39.846 --> 56:42.180
Carlos...
we need <i>tres</i> more outs

56:42.182 --> 56:43.681
to go into extra innings.
Mm-hm.

56:43.683 --> 56:45.183
Is that beer?

56:45.185 --> 56:47.418
No, it's Gatorade, honky.
Just give me the ball.

56:49.588 --> 56:52.239
The Benchwarmers
need to get something going

56:52.241 --> 56:54.976
against Carlos,
because he's unhittable.

56:57.447 --> 57:00.398
It's a live ball! Run it out!
Clark, run it out!

57:05.204 --> 57:06.103
Yes!

57:06.105 --> 57:08.255
Cheap-o hit-o,
<i>bicicleta.</i>

57:09.041 --> 57:10.574
Maria...

57:10.576 --> 57:12.209
why did you leave me, uh?

57:13.796 --> 57:16.965
Letting a 12-year-old drink
like that is disgusting.

57:16.967 --> 57:19.584
Here we go,
Richie, here we go!

57:19.586 --> 57:21.169
Ball!

57:21.171 --> 57:23.254
Come on, ump.
He's ducking the ball.

57:23.256 --> 57:27.008
Here we go,
Richie, here we go!

57:27.010 --> 57:28.225
Take your base.

57:33.350 --> 57:35.650
Gus is up.
And here's the pitch.

57:40.556 --> 57:41.556
Safe!

57:42.524 --> 57:44.375
Who...?
Hey. Who's on deck?

57:46.662 --> 57:47.862
Oh. Damn!

57:47.864 --> 57:49.614
Oh, no. They don't have
anyone else.

57:49.616 --> 57:51.532
They have to forfeit.
What?

57:51.534 --> 57:53.951
You have any reserve players?
No.

57:53.953 --> 57:56.421
What about that guy over there
eating sun block?

58:00.843 --> 58:02.076
He's never played before.

58:02.078 --> 58:04.545
That's not my problem.
He's got a uniform on.

58:04.547 --> 58:05.930
Hey.

58:05.932 --> 58:08.666
Either he plays,
or you forfeit the game.

58:08.668 --> 58:10.184
Play ball!

58:10.186 --> 58:12.353
Last inning,

58:12.355 --> 58:14.739
the winning run's on third,
and it's all up to Howie.

58:20.946 --> 58:22.647
Look at this freak.

58:22.649 --> 58:25.400
Son, son. You have to get
in the batter's box.

58:25.402 --> 58:26.534
Someone get his sword.

58:28.321 --> 58:29.704
Here you go, Howie.

58:29.706 --> 58:31.439
Take this.
Nelson. Nelson.

58:31.441 --> 58:32.907
Get up there and take a swing.

58:36.745 --> 58:38.913
Look at all those albinos.

58:40.800 --> 58:43.167
Wait till he pitches
the ball, retard.

58:44.586 --> 58:45.970
Strike!

58:45.972 --> 58:48.155
They should let him
use his sword.

58:49.674 --> 58:51.926
Maria!

58:51.928 --> 58:53.144
No.

58:53.146 --> 58:54.444
Come on, weird guy!

58:54.446 --> 58:55.930
Whoo!

58:55.932 --> 58:57.698
Weird guy!
Weird guy! Weird guy!

58:57.700 --> 58:58.699
Weird guy!

58:58.701 --> 58:59.950
Oh.

59:06.993 --> 59:07.775
Oh!

59:10.613 --> 59:11.995
Take your base.

59:11.997 --> 59:14.198
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!

59:14.200 --> 59:15.783
No way! We win! We win!

59:15.785 --> 59:16.951
<i>Amazing!</i>

59:16.953 --> 59:19.003
Hey, you have to
touch first base, kid.

59:19.005 --> 59:20.638
Come on. Come on,
come on. Come on.

59:20.640 --> 59:23.924
Howie, hit by the
pitch, forces in the winning run

59:23.926 --> 59:26.461
and sends the Benchwarmers
to the finals.

59:26.463 --> 59:27.628
That's game.

59:29.265 --> 59:30.964
<i>Hey, hey.</i>
Whoo-hoo!

59:32.801 --> 59:34.484
Carlos, you're drunk!

59:38.107 --> 59:39.524
Hey, hey.

59:39.526 --> 59:41.025
We're here with Richie Goodman

59:41.027 --> 59:42.092
of the Benchwarmers.

59:42.094 --> 59:43.811
How do you feel
after that big win?

59:43.813 --> 59:46.063
Hey, what can I say?
Baseball's in my blood.

59:46.065 --> 59:47.281
<i>Hey, could I, uh,</i>

59:47.283 --> 59:49.784
<i>give a shout-out</i>
<i>to my main salad girl</i>

59:49.786 --> 59:50.985
<i>at Pizza Hut?</i>

59:50.987 --> 59:53.821
<i>I like... salad.</i>

59:55.492 --> 59:57.208
Guys, can you believe this crap?

59:57.210 --> 59:58.493
I'd like to beat his ass,

59:58.495 --> 01:00:00.461
just like I did
back in the diz-ay.

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:01.996
Are they any good?

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:03.714
The only guy that's good
is that guy there.

01:00:03.716 --> 01:00:05.866
<i>This is Gus Matthews,</i>

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:07.668
<i>the heart and soul</i>
<i>of the Benchwarmers.</i>

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.470
Gus Matthews?

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:10.805
<i>So were you bullied as a kid?</i>

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:13.540
<i>Ah, the bully thing</i>
<i>affected my life pretty huge.</i>

01:00:13.542 --> 01:00:15.342
<i>And I just wanna tell</i>
<i>all you kids</i>

01:00:15.344 --> 01:00:18.312
<i>that messing with other kids</i>
<i>can really do a lot of damage.</i>

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:20.447
What? That guy
damaged

01:00:20.449 --> 01:00:22.233
more kids than anybody I knew.

01:00:22.235 --> 01:00:24.068
He made my life hell
growing up.

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:25.119
But you're twice his size.

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:26.904
You could crush
that little puke.

01:00:26.906 --> 01:00:28.989
He didn't do
the physical warfare.

01:00:28.991 --> 01:00:30.624
He played
the psychological card,

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:32.226
by attacking your weaknesses.

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:34.695
I started losing my hair
when I was 9 years old.

01:00:34.697 --> 01:00:37.298
He jumped all over it
with the mean nicknames.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.266
Eight Ball, Bowling Ball...

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:42.203
uh, Kojak, Mr. Clean,
Cream of Wheat Guy,

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:44.455
Scatman Crothers.

01:00:44.457 --> 01:00:46.290
The Black Uncle Fester.

01:00:46.292 --> 01:00:49.176
How about the Black Bodybuilding
Charlie Brown?

01:00:49.178 --> 01:00:50.711
That's a good one.

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:52.146
He used that too!

01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:56.834
Oh, don't cry, buddy.

01:00:56.836 --> 01:00:59.003
I think your hair's
the bomb, yo.

01:00:59.005 --> 01:01:01.105
It looks great.
Doesn't it, guys?

01:01:01.107 --> 01:01:02.356
Yeah.

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:03.724
Really, brothers?
Yeah.

01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:04.925
Sure, Daddy Warbucks.

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:06.794
I would've never have thought
that was a wig.

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:09.063
If I was blindfolded.

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:10.314
Whoa.

01:01:10.316 --> 01:01:11.566
We got a problem?

01:01:11.568 --> 01:01:13.967
Why don't you punch me
in the face as hard as you can.

01:01:13.969 --> 01:01:15.369
Pour some honey on me.

01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:17.471
Let me see you get really mad.

01:01:19.824 --> 01:01:21.075
Anyway,

01:01:21.077 --> 01:01:23.778
uh, at least I left there
with my sanity.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.913
He actually teased
this one midget boy

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:27.648
in our neighborhood
league so bad,

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:29.383
the little fella
up and quit baseball

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.219
and went into the loony bin.

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:33.371
Guys, we gotta tell Jerry.
He's gonna love this.

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:35.906
- Definitely.
- Yeah.

01:01:37.258 --> 01:01:39.293
Really?
Well, thanks, Cassandra.

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:40.461
What's the score now, Mel?

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:42.597
Well, Jerry's Lumber
just won, 5-2.

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:44.899
That means our town
gets the stadium!

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:46.383
You mean,
Nelson and his buddies will,

01:01:46.385 --> 01:01:47.935
because we'll kill those guys!

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:49.604
Wicked!

01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:51.054
Number 7, shakes all around!

01:01:51.056 --> 01:01:52.273
Yes!

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:53.457
I gotta take a leak.

01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:55.459
Down the hall,
12th door on the right.

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:02.116
<i>Last night, we did a story</i>
<i>about the Benchwarmers...</i>

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:04.418
Hey, check it out.
<i>...a team of three grown men</i>

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.087
<i>who were excluded</i>
<i>from baseball as kids,</i>

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:07.755
<i>and who are now making up</i>
<i>for lost time.</i>

01:02:09.357 --> 01:02:12.059
<i>Hello, Gus.
This is the urinal speaking.</i>

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:14.712
<i>A chemical analysis</i>
<i>of your pee shows you'd better</i>

01:02:14.714 --> 01:02:17.447
<i>stop eating all that fast food,</i>
<i>or you're going to die.</i>

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:21.802
<i>We have just been given</i>
<i>evidence that one of the men,</i>

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:25.056
<i>Gus Matthews, is not the man</i>
<i>he's been saying he is.</i>

01:02:25.058 --> 01:02:26.023
Hey, no shake for me.

01:02:26.025 --> 01:02:27.475
The toilet said so.
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:30.278
<i>Gus Matthews was easily</i>
<i>the biggest bully in Brookdale.</i>

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:33.581
<i>Well, you weren't the nicest</i>
<i>kid in school either, Steven.</i>

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:36.883
<i>I hate everybody!</i>

01:02:36.885 --> 01:02:38.486
<i>What a baby.</i>

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.654
<i>But he's right. I was</i>
<i>their principal back then,</i>

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:42.657
<i>and Gus was</i>
<i>in my office constantly.</i>

01:02:42.659 --> 01:02:44.942
<i>I remember he especially</i>
<i>picked so hard on one kid,</i>

01:02:44.944 --> 01:02:47.161
<i>that the poor boy</i>
<i>had to be institutionalized.</i>

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:48.612
<i>That's really too bad.</i>

01:02:48.614 --> 01:02:51.398
<i>Those guys inspired</i>
<i>a lot of really nice kids.</i>

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.534
<i>This is Kathy Dobson</i>
<i>from Channel 9 news.</i>

01:02:55.486 --> 01:02:56.753
You were a jerk

01:02:56.755 --> 01:02:59.307
just like the rest
of the kids who mess with me?

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:01.842
I made a mistake, Nelson.

01:03:03.245 --> 01:03:06.480
I wish I could
take it all back.

01:03:06.482 --> 01:03:08.899
I can't believe
I looked up to you.

01:03:15.573 --> 01:03:17.474
I don't know what to say, guys.

01:03:18.777 --> 01:03:20.678
I'm sorry.

01:03:27.518 --> 01:03:29.620
<i>Let's party.</i>

01:03:29.622 --> 01:03:31.372
<i>Not now,</i> Number 7.

01:03:36.761 --> 01:03:39.563
Is that why you don't
wanna have kids, Gus?

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:44.301
Do you feel you don't
deserve a happy family

01:03:44.303 --> 01:03:46.436
because of what you did
in your past?

01:03:47.405 --> 01:03:49.807
I'm afraid that
if we have kids,

01:03:49.809 --> 01:03:51.574
they're gonna get picked on
without mercy

01:03:51.576 --> 01:03:54.711
because karma will be
catching up with me.

01:03:54.713 --> 01:03:56.781
Sweetheart, you are wrong.

01:03:56.783 --> 01:03:59.650
Life's about learning lessons.

01:03:59.652 --> 01:04:01.952
I can't just learn
a lesson and move on.

01:04:01.954 --> 01:04:03.371
Look, that little boy

01:04:03.373 --> 01:04:04.688
that I picked on
when I was a kid,

01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:06.123
he didn't ever move on.

01:04:06.125 --> 01:04:08.258
I bet he'd be able to move on

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:10.294
if you said you were sorry.

01:04:22.123 --> 01:04:23.890
Can I help you?

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:26.727
Marcus, honey.

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:27.928
What is it, Mother?

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:30.514
I just finished another
peanut butter sculpture.

01:04:30.516 --> 01:04:32.316
It's a pterodactyl.

01:04:32.318 --> 01:04:34.318
Oh, that's nice.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.321
Uh, you have a visitor, dear.

01:04:37.323 --> 01:04:38.956
But I don't know anyone.

01:04:41.926 --> 01:04:44.027
It's Gus from grade school.

01:04:44.946 --> 01:04:46.864
No!

01:04:46.866 --> 01:04:48.765
Don't come down here!

01:04:49.802 --> 01:04:51.452
No. No!

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:53.120
Marcus.
No, don't come down!

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:54.087
Take it easy.

01:04:54.089 --> 01:04:55.589
Take it easy.

01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:56.856
No. Don't touch me!

01:04:56.858 --> 01:04:57.875
Please, hear me out.

01:04:57.877 --> 01:04:59.393
Just give me a chance.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.435
Marcus, stop trying to
cast spells.

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:08.636
Marcus...

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:09.719
Stay away!

01:05:13.975 --> 01:05:16.243
Look. Marcus,
I want to apologize

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:19.313
for all the nasty things I did
to you when we were kids.

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:20.898
I'm not here to mess with...

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:24.584
No! You're lying to me
like all the other times.

01:05:24.586 --> 01:05:26.620
You are denied entry.

01:05:26.622 --> 01:05:28.989
I'm sorry, from
the bottom of my heart.

01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:30.908
I was stupid, Marcus.

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:32.209
Get out of my basement!

01:05:32.211 --> 01:05:34.394
You're a bad, bad man!

01:05:34.396 --> 01:05:35.663
Go! Get out!

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:38.299
Look, I didn't expect you
to forgive me. I mean...

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:39.600
Look, I know because of me

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:40.834
you were never able to feel

01:05:40.836 --> 01:05:42.869
what it was like to play ball

01:05:42.871 --> 01:05:45.089
or be part of a team.

01:05:45.091 --> 01:05:46.490
So...

01:05:47.559 --> 01:05:48.992
I wanna give you
my hat, Marcus.

01:05:50.228 --> 01:05:52.729
Because even though
you didn't know it...

01:05:52.731 --> 01:05:55.365
you are the heart and soul
of this squad.

01:05:58.269 --> 01:06:00.070
I'll see you around, buddy.

01:06:12.784 --> 01:06:14.451
Start here.

01:06:14.453 --> 01:06:16.620
You've got 24 hours.

01:06:16.622 --> 01:06:17.988
What, are you serious?

01:06:18.807 --> 01:06:19.890
If you build it...

01:06:19.892 --> 01:06:22.692
nerds will come.

01:06:22.694 --> 01:06:24.261
And keep it under a billion.

01:06:24.263 --> 01:06:26.013
It's all I've got...

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:27.915
on me.

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:30.483
Excellent!

01:06:30.485 --> 01:06:32.353
Okay, people!

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:35.038
We got 24 hours
to build us a ballpark!

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.473
Can we do it?!

01:06:36.475 --> 01:06:38.208
Yeah!

01:06:56.177 --> 01:06:57.594
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:06:57.596 --> 01:06:58.995
Oh, cool.

01:06:58.997 --> 01:07:00.331
Are you kidding me?

01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:01.332
Look at this.

01:07:01.334 --> 01:07:03.250
Dude, this place is huge!
Oh, wow.

01:07:03.252 --> 01:07:04.234
Swings!

01:07:04.236 --> 01:07:05.835
We'll go on the swings later.

01:07:05.837 --> 01:07:07.588
Slide.

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.256
That's right, there's a pool.

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:10.291
We'll all go in after.

01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:11.725
Oh. I forgot my floaties.

01:07:11.727 --> 01:07:13.961
We're here live in Greenfield
for the big game

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:16.730
between the Benchwarmers
and Jerry's Lumber.

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:19.433
The Benchwarmers were
recently rocked by scandal.

01:07:19.435 --> 01:07:21.084
Let's see what the fans
have to say.

01:07:21.086 --> 01:07:22.502
Excuse me. Sir.

01:07:22.504 --> 01:07:24.605
What do you think of
the accusations against Gus?

01:07:24.607 --> 01:07:26.206
His soul will perish
in the fire pit

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:27.207
of the underworld.

01:07:29.194 --> 01:07:30.293
<i>I love it!</i>

01:07:30.295 --> 01:07:32.195
<i>There you have it.</i>
<i>The fire pits.</i>

01:07:32.197 --> 01:07:34.197
<i>Not a good time.</i>

01:07:35.367 --> 01:07:36.800
Around the horn.

01:07:38.003 --> 01:07:40.220
We could still win this thing.

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:41.672
Wha...? How?

01:07:41.674 --> 01:07:43.040
If we use the Force.

01:07:43.042 --> 01:07:45.909
Let's try not to be
<i>too</i> geeky, Clark.

01:07:45.911 --> 01:07:48.778
The Force is powerful,
my young Padawan.

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.814
He's right.
It is.

01:07:50.816 --> 01:07:52.649
Hey, guys.

01:07:55.937 --> 01:07:58.271
I know I'm not
on the team anymore...

01:07:58.273 --> 01:08:00.224
but I just wanted you
to know that

01:08:00.226 --> 01:08:01.859
I'm here to support you.

01:08:01.861 --> 01:08:04.461
Because you'll always be
my best friends.

01:08:05.397 --> 01:08:06.814
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:09.984
welcome to Shmegmer Park,

01:08:09.986 --> 01:08:13.153
and the final game
of Mel's Tournament

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:14.905
of Little Baseballers

01:08:14.907 --> 01:08:17.157
and Three Older Guys.

01:08:18.577 --> 01:08:19.841
Homo!

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:23.712
Hey. Check out
the little gnome.

01:08:26.751 --> 01:08:28.501
Play ball!

01:08:31.924 --> 01:08:33.173
Can I say something?

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:35.408
Yeah, I guess so.

01:08:37.145 --> 01:08:38.595
Hand me the mike, please.

01:08:38.596 --> 01:08:39.912
I can't reach it.

01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:44.051
Hello, everyone.

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:46.252
My name is Marcus Ellwood.

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:49.823
Or better known
as Dragonmaster784.

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:51.774
Or Yoda! Or Midget Boy!

01:08:54.795 --> 01:08:56.029
It is true...

01:08:56.032 --> 01:08:59.066
I ended up in an institution
as a child from...

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:02.569
From Gus bullying me
all the time.

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:05.506
And he made my life
miserable for years.

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:06.640
To be honest...

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:10.377
I thought I would
never stop hating him.

01:09:12.131 --> 01:09:14.147
But then yesterday...

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.316
he came to visit me
in my basement.

01:09:17.201 --> 01:09:19.368
And as I cowered
in my peanut butter fort,

01:09:19.371 --> 01:09:21.970
he apologized to me.

01:09:21.973 --> 01:09:25.442
And I could hear the sadness
in his voice.

01:09:25.444 --> 01:09:27.577
This nerd makes <i>me</i>
seem like Rambo.

01:09:27.578 --> 01:09:28.912
I don't think so.

01:09:28.913 --> 01:09:30.113
John Stamos?

01:09:30.115 --> 01:09:32.282
Warmer.

01:09:32.283 --> 01:09:35.886
And then moments
after my old nemesis left...

01:09:35.888 --> 01:09:38.854
I saw a hat
on my stuffed moose.

01:09:38.857 --> 01:09:41.158
The hat of a Benchwarmer.

01:09:42.426 --> 01:09:46.345
A Benchwarmer begging
for a new start, just like me.

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:48.298
And so many of you.

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:49.649
He shouldn't get a new start!

01:09:49.651 --> 01:09:52.502
I'll never forgive
the kids who picked on me!

01:09:53.654 --> 01:09:54.955
Young one...

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:57.224
life is too short
to harbor hatred.

01:09:58.592 --> 01:10:01.645
Do you remember episode
number 38 of <i>Dungeon Wars?</i>

01:10:01.647 --> 01:10:02.779
Yeah.

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:03.931
Yeah.

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:06.966
The golden elves forgive
the great giants

01:10:06.968 --> 01:10:08.769
for destroying their village,

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:12.206
even though the giants
made the elves' life hell.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:15.909
The elves realized
the giants were tortured too.

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:17.561
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

01:10:20.699 --> 01:10:22.565
He's a modern-day Yoda.
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:22.567 --> 01:10:24.134
I mean, not his looks,

01:10:24.136 --> 01:10:25.435
but his philosophy stuff.

01:10:26.737 --> 01:10:29.039
Actually, his looks too...
His looks a little bit too.

01:10:29.041 --> 01:10:30.457
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:33.527
And so, I forgive
my new friend, Gus,

01:10:33.529 --> 01:10:35.212
as all of you should.

01:10:35.214 --> 01:10:37.280
Look at all the joy and hope

01:10:37.282 --> 01:10:38.581
he's brought to all of us.

01:10:39.717 --> 01:10:42.302
He has more than paid his dues.

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:44.972
Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:46.189
Go, Gus.

01:10:46.191 --> 01:10:47.891
Come on, Marcus!

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:51.145
Thank you, Marcus.

01:10:51.147 --> 01:10:52.445
Get up here.

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:54.881
Hey.
Thanks.

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:56.617
Buddies for life.
Thanks.

01:10:56.619 --> 01:10:57.985
Aww...

01:10:57.987 --> 01:10:59.836
I want a little man too.

01:10:59.838 --> 01:11:01.337
Here you go.

01:11:02.006 --> 01:11:03.006
- Oh!
- Aw.

01:11:06.844 --> 01:11:08.445
Aww...

01:11:08.447 --> 01:11:09.913
You know, me and the guys
have been

01:11:09.915 --> 01:11:11.080
playing all these games,

01:11:11.082 --> 01:11:13.249
not for revenge.

01:11:13.251 --> 01:11:15.318
We did it to show that <i>everyone</i>

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.186
should be allowed
to play baseball

01:11:17.188 --> 01:11:18.522
<i>and have fun.</i>

01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:19.473
All right!

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:21.425
Right on!

01:11:21.427 --> 01:11:22.825
And that is why...

01:11:22.827 --> 01:11:24.094
Clark, Richie and I

01:11:24.096 --> 01:11:26.313
will <i>not</i> be playing
in the game today.

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:28.182
What?

01:11:28.184 --> 01:11:29.816
Instead, our team will consist

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:30.884
of a bunch of kids

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:32.452
who've never known
what it's like

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:33.553
to play in front of a crowd

01:11:33.555 --> 01:11:34.921
or to be cheered on.

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:37.323
Let me tell you,
it's an awesome feeling.

01:11:37.325 --> 01:11:39.793
So, please, put your nerd

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:41.194
and jock hands together,

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:43.196
and welcome to the field
the new <i>Benchwarmers!</i>

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:46.048
Woo! Yeah!

01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:48.085
Hey!
Hi!

01:11:48.087 --> 01:11:50.170
All right.

01:11:50.172 --> 01:11:51.972
Now, lastly, let's
make some noise

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.974
for your new
third-base coach...

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:55.759
Marcus Ellwood!

01:11:55.761 --> 01:11:57.577
Yeah!

01:11:59.163 --> 01:12:01.130
Is he all right?

01:12:01.132 --> 01:12:04.434
For years I thought
the sun was a monster.

01:12:04.436 --> 01:12:06.719
I'm here to tell you
that it's not a monster.

01:12:06.721 --> 01:12:08.054
Okay.
It's not a monster!

01:12:08.056 --> 01:12:09.389
Yeah.
You're all right.

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:10.690
Hey. Take him
in the shade.

01:12:10.692 --> 01:12:12.625
All right.
Let's have some fun!

01:12:12.627 --> 01:12:15.128
<i>Hey, everybody,
it's Clark and Richie, and we're...</i>

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:17.197
<i>We're standing in</i>
<i>for Gretchen and Mitchell.</i>

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:19.066
And we're gonna get
things going right now.

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.066
Big deck.

01:12:20.068 --> 01:12:21.084
Whoa! He got it.

01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:22.819
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

01:12:23.956 --> 01:12:25.072
Oh.

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:26.874
Ah... A-and he's okay.

01:12:26.876 --> 01:12:27.990
Oh, hey!
That's my helmet!

01:12:27.992 --> 01:12:29.576
That's my helmet!

01:12:29.578 --> 01:12:31.328
It's all right, buddy!

01:12:31.330 --> 01:12:33.062
Nice try, Sammy!

01:12:33.064 --> 01:12:35.132
Oh, my God. I just saw
your head for the first time.

01:12:35.134 --> 01:12:36.500
Ee.

01:12:36.502 --> 01:12:38.185
<i>Let's give a round of applause</i>

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.753
<i>for little Sammy Sprinkler.</i>

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:41.922
He missed it,
and people are cheering.

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:43.907
Yeah, and his coach
didn't even yell at him.

01:12:43.909 --> 01:12:45.592
That's pretty cool.

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:47.410
And here comes
our leadoff hitter

01:12:47.412 --> 01:12:49.479
with a familiar tape job.

01:12:49.481 --> 01:12:51.982
Gretchen, I know why
you're taping your hands.

01:12:51.984 --> 01:12:53.916
I also know why there's...

01:12:53.918 --> 01:12:56.319
three squirrels that won't be
attending this game today.

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:01.358
Strike! Strike!
Strike!

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.776
Well, there's a strikeout.

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:05.112
That's okay!
Good try! Good try!

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.747
Good going, Gretchen.
Yeah!

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:08.398
All right,
next up it's Jarrett.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.951
If you know Jarrett, you know
his sister works at Pizza Hut.

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:12.285
She's right over there.

01:13:13.404 --> 01:13:14.220
Hi.

01:13:16.374 --> 01:13:17.774
Another strikeout.

01:13:19.677 --> 01:13:20.860
And a strikeout.

01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:22.879
Strikeout.

01:13:22.881 --> 01:13:24.848
Strikeout. Strikeout.
Strikeout.

01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:27.100
And a strikeout.
Whoa. Yeah!

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:29.219
I think we got a free stadium!

01:13:29.221 --> 01:13:31.121
We're beating
them in strikeouts.

01:13:31.123 --> 01:13:32.372
And you're also beating them

01:13:32.374 --> 01:13:33.974
in boogers picked,
so we got that.

01:13:37.395 --> 01:13:39.496
Good game.
Drive home safe tonight.

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:41.365
On the yellow brick road.

01:13:41.367 --> 01:13:43.183
God, he's a dick.

01:13:45.486 --> 01:13:47.070
Oh, he got all of that one.

01:13:47.072 --> 01:13:48.422
Back, back, back, back, back...

01:13:50.291 --> 01:13:51.208
Spaloosh!

01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:52.993
In the pool!

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:54.711
Good hit, Kyle.

01:13:54.713 --> 01:13:55.996
Yeah.

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:57.680
Nice one, Kyle.

01:13:58.916 --> 01:14:00.183
Go, Kyle.

01:14:01.502 --> 01:14:03.453
Well, it's 42 to nothing

01:14:03.455 --> 01:14:04.755
as we head into the last inning.

01:14:04.757 --> 01:14:06.356
And it looks like
the Benchwarmers

01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:08.725
will go down without a fight.

01:14:08.727 --> 01:14:10.726
Hey. What are you
smiling at?

01:14:10.728 --> 01:14:12.929
I-I don't know. I guess
how much fun they're having.

01:14:12.931 --> 01:14:14.531
Wipe the smile off your face,

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:15.849
or I'll wipe it off for you.

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:16.849
You got three more outs.

01:14:16.851 --> 01:14:18.084
You blow this shutout,

01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:20.070
you won't play on a team
next year, you got it?

01:14:20.072 --> 01:14:22.439
Get out there and annihilate
those stinkweeds!

01:14:23.409 --> 01:14:24.825
Let's go!

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:26.710
Come on, let's do this!

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:28.211
Woo!

01:14:29.447 --> 01:14:30.831
Strike one!

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:32.165
Hang in there, son!

01:14:32.167 --> 01:14:33.232
Come on, Nelson!

01:14:35.203 --> 01:14:36.920
Strike two!

01:14:36.922 --> 01:14:38.705
Come on, strike out this loser!

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:40.607
You know what?

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:43.476
You're the loser.

01:14:44.128 --> 01:14:45.879
Time!

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:46.946
What's up, buddy?

01:14:47.397 --> 01:14:48.732
Hey, Nelson.

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:50.366
I'm gonna throw you one
down the middle.

01:14:50.368 --> 01:14:51.268
What does that mean?

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:52.886
It means choke up
on the bat a little

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:54.221
and swing away.

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:56.089
The ball's gonna be right there.

01:14:56.091 --> 01:14:57.340
Hey, thanks.

01:14:57.342 --> 01:14:59.542
I can help with your
social studies homework later,

01:14:59.544 --> 01:15:00.777
if you need it.

01:15:00.779 --> 01:15:03.980
Sounds good.
I <i>suck</i> at social studies.

01:15:03.982 --> 01:15:06.066
Okay, guys, follow my lead.

01:15:11.323 --> 01:15:13.156
Whoops! Butterfingers.

01:15:13.158 --> 01:15:14.157
He got a hit!

01:15:14.159 --> 01:15:15.575
Come on! Go, go!

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:17.411
Oh, my God!

01:15:17.413 --> 01:15:19.079
Why are you kicking it?!

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:20.046
Go, go!

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:27.320
Keep going!

01:15:29.007 --> 01:15:30.123
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:31.425
Run!

01:15:31.427 --> 01:15:32.292
Come... Come on!

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:34.678
Go! Go! Go home!
Go! Go! Go home!

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.096
Go, go, go!
Go, Nelson!

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:38.348
Nelson, get at the plate!

01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:39.516
Yes! Woo!

01:15:39.518 --> 01:15:40.583
Slide! Slide!

01:15:41.736 --> 01:15:43.103
Safe!

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:44.271
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:45.605
We did not get shut out!

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:47.574
Woo!

01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:52.062
Yes! Woo!

01:15:52.064 --> 01:15:54.697
Yes! Oooh!

01:15:54.699 --> 01:15:56.666
Yes! Woo!

01:16:02.507 --> 01:16:04.391
What is going on?!
What is going on?

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.626
Let go of me!
Nerds!

01:16:07.929 --> 01:16:09.746
You put me down!
What is going on?

01:16:09.748 --> 01:16:11.081
Ahh! Ahh!

01:16:11.083 --> 01:16:13.433
Ahh!

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:24.577
<i>Ta-da!</i>

01:16:34.439 --> 01:16:35.872
Can I let you in on a secret?

01:16:35.874 --> 01:16:37.657
Sure.

01:16:37.659 --> 01:16:40.327
I've never actually, like...

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:42.379
totally 100 percent
kissed a girl before.

01:16:42.381 --> 01:16:44.297
And, uh, I was wondering if...

01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:46.582
you would be my first one.

01:16:47.918 --> 01:16:49.669
I would like
nothing more than that.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.973
Rea...?

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:54.207
Clark!

01:16:55.259 --> 01:16:57.144
You kissed a girl before I did?

01:16:57.146 --> 01:17:00.063
This is way better
than macaroni.

01:17:02.901 --> 01:17:05.485
Oh. Mm.

01:17:05.487 --> 01:17:07.503
I'm not afraid
of the sun anymore.

01:17:07.505 --> 01:17:08.922
That's good, buddy.

01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:10.556
How's the moon treating you?

01:17:10.558 --> 01:17:12.125
Not a fan.

01:17:14.094 --> 01:17:15.095
Hey, Gus.

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:16.112
The new Benchwarmers

01:17:16.114 --> 01:17:17.346
are gonna need a
coach next year.

01:17:17.348 --> 01:17:18.532
What do you say?

01:17:18.534 --> 01:17:21.167
I'd be honored, Mel, but...

01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:23.636
I might be a little busy
getting my family started.

01:17:24.254 --> 01:17:26.039
Actually, honey, it's...

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.791
already been started.

01:17:29.878 --> 01:17:31.595
Really?
Mm-hm.

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:34.931
Hey, everybody!

01:17:34.933 --> 01:17:36.716
I'm gonna be a dad!

01:17:40.021 --> 01:17:41.021
Way to go, man!

01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:45.558
That's quite an ovation.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.093
You wanna hear
an even bigger one?

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.728
The reason she's pregnant

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:51.448
is because I went
all the way with her!

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:56.820
Ahh!

01:17:58.657 --> 01:17:59.889
That's so great.

01:17:59.891 --> 01:18:01.491
What does "all the way" mean?

01:18:02.305 --> 01:18:08.431
