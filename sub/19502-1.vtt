00:55.168 --> 00:59.298
<i> Since the dawn of time,</i>
<i>space flight has been a dream.</i>

00:59.373 --> 01:02.007
<i>The rocket made
it a reality.</i>

01:02.476 --> 01:05.968
<i>But before man braved</i>
<i>that first giant step...</i>

01:06.046 --> 01:08.947
<i>the brave stepped into the rocket...</i>

01:09.015 --> 01:11.483
<i>and the brave were chimps.</i>

01:14.254 --> 01:17.246
<i>Ham 1 was the first American</i>
<i>to boldly go...</i>

01:17.324 --> 01:20.487
<i>where no man, or chimp,</i>
<i>had gone before.</i>

01:20.560 --> 01:24.394
<i>And tonight his brave legacy lives on.</i>

01:24.464 --> 01:29.299
<i>Introducing Ham the Third...</i>

01:29.369 --> 01:31.997
Ham's one and only grandson.

01:32.072 --> 01:35.269
Thank you. Thank you.
No autographs. No flash photos.

01:35.342 --> 01:37.674
- Okay, fine. Photos. I'll sign that later.

01:40.180 --> 01:44.947
Ladies and gentlemen, strap yourselves in
as we embark on a mission to the stars!

01:45.018 --> 01:46.883
Space, stars, blah, blah, blah.

01:46.953 --> 01:50.218
- Enough with the lecture. Let's get to the action.
- Aim high, buckle up.

01:50.290 --> 01:52.224
Chin down, opposable thumbs in.

01:52.292 --> 01:55.090
When you gonna stop worrying about me,
Houston? Space is in my veins.

01:55.162 --> 01:57.630
- And between your ears.
- It's showtime!

01:57.697 --> 02:00.131
Here we go! Come on!
Let's make some noise!

02:00.200 --> 02:02.532
Let's tear the roof off of this tent.
We're gonna go bananas!

02:02.602 --> 02:05.537
Hup! Hey! Hoop!
Prepare to be amaze-ified.

02:05.605 --> 02:08.836
- Let's light this candle.
- <i> Say it with me.</i>

02:08.908 --> 02:12.037
- T-minus three-
- Three, two, one!

02:12.112 --> 02:14.103
Blast off!

02:14.181 --> 02:18.811
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

02:18.885 --> 02:21.854
Ladies.

02:33.266 --> 02:35.996
And back again.

02:36.069 --> 02:39.004
I'm so excited. I just can't hide it!

02:39.072 --> 02:41.233
Keep your eye on the landing pad.

02:41.308 --> 02:45.836
No monkey business.

02:45.912 --> 02:47.880
<i>Stay on target, hotshot.</i>

02:47.948 --> 02:51.349
Big finale comin' up. Hoo-hoo!

02:51.418 --> 02:53.750
And a flipsy...

02:53.820 --> 02:57.483
and a dipsy and a do.

02:58.592 --> 03:01.857
Whoo-hoo! Whoa!
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

03:01.928 --> 03:04.362
- Oh, Lord.
- Whoa!

03:04.431 --> 03:06.991
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

03:07.067 --> 03:09.331
<i>This is not good! Oh!</i>

03:09.402 --> 03:12.394
<i>Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

03:12.472 --> 03:15.100
He's always showboatin'.

03:18.178 --> 03:20.169
Ta-da!

03:20.247 --> 03:23.410
<i>It's all good, folks!</i>
<i>That's why I put the helmet on the monkey.</i>

03:35.829 --> 03:39.822
The <i>Infinity</i>
probe successfully advancing past lunar orbit.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.869
Status:
Unmanned and remote-controlled.

03:44.304 --> 03:47.205
Mission: Search for life.

03:50.677 --> 03:53.737
Detecting unidentified space anomaly.

03:55.048 --> 03:57.812
Warning. System malfunction.

03:57.884 --> 03:59.818
System malfunction.

04:16.636 --> 04:18.627
- It's so pretty!
- Ha!

04:18.704 --> 04:20.673
Come here, little fluttereye.

04:24.544 --> 04:27.479
- Oh, no!
- Zartog!

04:29.549 --> 04:32.347
Can't you brats read?
Keep away from my house!

04:32.419 --> 04:35.946
- Oy.
- Hmm.

04:37.524 --> 04:40.516
You monster!

04:40.594 --> 04:44.860
If I could catch you punks,
I'd dunk you in the Freznar too!

04:44.931 --> 04:47.456
No wonder why
everyone in town hates you!

04:47.534 --> 04:49.593
Just the way I like it. Huh?

04:49.669 --> 04:53.662
Whoa! Look! It's coming closer!

04:53.740 --> 04:56.106
<i>It's a sky beast!</i>

04:58.712 --> 05:01.272
Crudlar.

05:04.184 --> 05:08.348
A gift from the sky.

05:08.421 --> 05:10.412
<i>Hey!</i>

05:16.696 --> 05:19.722
Huh?

05:21.034 --> 05:24.299
I am the <i>Infinity</i> probe
from the planet Earth.

05:24.371 --> 05:29.673
We will now perform a full-body examination
for purely scientific purposes.

05:29.743 --> 05:32.143
Oh.

05:39.419 --> 05:41.717
Since the dawn of time,
man's indomitable spirit...

05:41.788 --> 05:44.188
has led to great achievements
in culture and civilization.

05:44.257 --> 05:49.593
<i>He's created wonders in architecture,</i>
<i>art, music, engineering.</i>

05:49.663 --> 05:52.689
But man isn't all work.
He likes to play too!

05:52.766 --> 05:54.825
I want to live like them.

06:03.076 --> 06:06.102
- System control interface operational.
- Huh?

06:08.081 --> 06:12.177
Manual override engaging.

06:12.252 --> 06:16.382
Help me!

06:25.298 --> 06:27.892
- Aha!
- Huh?

06:29.135 --> 06:33.265
A new day has come,
and that day is Zartog!

06:46.286 --> 06:50.245
<i>The simian program started in the 1960s.</i>

06:50.323 --> 06:53.315
And these chimpanzees are like
the ones used in the first space missions.

06:53.393 --> 06:56.453
- <i>When do they go in space?</i>
- Well, they don't.

06:56.529 --> 06:58.793
<i>They're just exhibits of the past.</i>

07:02.902 --> 07:05.268
Hey, what's up, Comet?

07:05.338 --> 07:07.932
I don't know, but something big!

07:08.007 --> 07:10.908
What do you mean "lost"?

07:10.977 --> 07:13.673
Senator,
the <i>Infinity</i> was drawn off course...

07:13.747 --> 07:18.582
<i>by a magnetic attraction from a dimensional</i>
<i>anomaly in the time-space continuum.</i>

07:18.651 --> 07:22.678
- In English.
- It was sucked into a wormhole.

07:22.756 --> 07:26.214
My constituents care about potholes,
not wormholes.

07:26.292 --> 07:29.284
Do you know how many potholes
we can fix for five billion dollars?

07:30.964 --> 07:32.955
- Area of the pothole.
- The power of three.

07:33.032 --> 07:34.897
- Multiplied by four.
- Cosine.

07:34.968 --> 07:36.526
- <i>Multiplied by seven.</i>
- <i>Carry the two-</i>

07:36.603 --> 07:39.037
50.6 million!

07:39.105 --> 07:41.767
- Depending on fluctuations in asphalt-
- Labor costs-

07:41.841 --> 07:45.277
- And overtime.
- It was a rhetorical question, brainiacs.

07:45.345 --> 07:49.577
<i>Our data indicates the</i> Infinity's
<i>emerged on the far side of the universe.</i>

07:49.649 --> 07:51.640
As you can see from this image...

07:51.718 --> 07:56.212
the <i>Infinity</i> has landed on a planet
in a crater filled with H20.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.150
- It means water.
- I know what it means.

08:01.227 --> 08:05.527
<i>Senator, if the atmosphere is viable,</i>
<i>the planet could sustain life.</i>

08:05.598 --> 08:07.566
Maybe even an NFL expansion team.

08:07.634 --> 08:10.398
This could prove
what we suspected all along.

08:10.470 --> 08:12.529
We are not alone.

08:12.605 --> 08:14.903
Just think what a mission
could do for science.

08:14.974 --> 08:17.033
Not to mention T-shirt sales.

08:17.110 --> 08:20.170
Political gold.
I want astronauts over there pronto.

08:20.246 --> 08:22.578
<i>Not gonna happen.</i>
<i>Too risky for humans.</i>

08:22.649 --> 08:25.209
We don't have a clue how the wormhole
will affect living tissue.

08:25.285 --> 08:28.448
It could transmogrify the D.N.A.,
causing blindness.

08:28.521 --> 08:31.649
- Heart failure.
- Most likely, death.

08:31.724 --> 08:33.692
Gripping.

08:37.797 --> 08:39.788
Comet, what are you doing?

08:39.866 --> 08:41.857
Getting us a mission.

08:54.180 --> 08:57.877
- We could send the chimps.
- Chimps? Chimps.

08:57.951 --> 09:01.512
Hmm. Not humans, but not horrible.
Show me what you got.

09:01.588 --> 09:03.351
Guys, we got a mission.

09:03.423 --> 09:07.189
Senator, Titan, Luna and Comet
are fully prepared for the mission.

09:07.260 --> 09:10.320
They have been training for this
their whole lives.

09:10.396 --> 09:13.797
Training, shmaining. These chimps are boring!

09:13.867 --> 09:15.801
They're... chimp nerds.

09:15.869 --> 09:18.702
Uh, technically, there's no such thing
as nerds in the simian world.

09:18.771 --> 09:21.638
I know a nerd when I see one.

09:21.708 --> 09:25.804
- Do you think he means we're nerds?
- No, no. We're super cool.

09:25.879 --> 09:31.374
<i>What this mission needs is some P.R.,</i>
<i>some sizzle to grab the media's attention.</i>

09:31.451 --> 09:33.715
It needs a chimp with the right stuff.

09:33.786 --> 09:36.380
It needs someone like... him!

09:37.457 --> 09:40.620
A real hero, with dignity and nobility.

09:40.693 --> 09:43.423
He's been dead for 30 years.

09:43.496 --> 09:46.727
But he does have a grandson.

09:56.743 --> 10:00.645
Ta-da!

10:00.713 --> 10:04.877
<i>Ahh! Oh, ho-ho-ho!</i>
<i>Houston, no! Ooh!</i>

10:04.951 --> 10:06.919
<i>Oh! Thumb pain. Aah!</i>

10:06.986 --> 10:09.819
- When I promised your grandpa I'd look after ya-
- Ooh! Ow!

10:09.889 --> 10:13.757
I never thought I'd be playin' pick-up sticks
with monkey bones night after night.

10:13.826 --> 10:15.794
What can I say?
I'm an envelope pusher.

10:15.862 --> 10:17.796
- I can't do anything halfway.
- Yeah?

10:17.864 --> 10:21.265
Well, you keep showboatin',
and you'll be halfway to the taxidermist.

10:21.334 --> 10:24.132
<i> No, no, you can't take him!</i>
<i>He belongs to me.</i>

10:24.203 --> 10:27.297
Official government business:
eminent domain, national security...

10:27.373 --> 10:30.934
a lot of other scary black helicopter stuff
you don't wanna mess with.

10:32.111 --> 10:34.306
Ooh. He's older than I expected.

10:34.380 --> 10:38.441
Well, you ain't no spring chicken either.

10:38.518 --> 10:43.012
- And you're lookin' for-
- <i>Oh, he's so cute!</i>

10:43.089 --> 10:44.954
Yeah, I'm a hottie.

10:45.024 --> 10:50.155
I am Dr. Smothers, and you are going
into space just like grandfather.

10:50.229 --> 10:52.220
Space?
Wrong answer.

10:52.298 --> 10:55.893
You got the wrong Ham, Doctor. Okay.
Bye, space lady who's attracted to me.

10:55.969 --> 10:58.164
- Hey!
- Good to see ya. Take care.

10:58.237 --> 11:00.831
- Don't let the door hit ya on the-
- Well, uh-

11:00.907 --> 11:03.740
He seems very excited to go.

11:03.810 --> 11:07.644
<i>Kid, you're throwin' away</i>
<i>the only shot you got.</i>

11:07.714 --> 11:11.172
This is a chance to make good,
live up to your legacy.

11:11.250 --> 11:15.152
Hey, I'm the star of my show, not just
the warm-up act for some human astronaut.

11:15.221 --> 11:17.587
Your grandfather
wasn't some warm-up act.

11:17.657 --> 11:19.921
He was a NASA astronaut.

11:19.993 --> 11:23.190
Got his face on magazines,
newspapers, television.

11:23.262 --> 11:26.925
- <i>He even met the president.</i>
- I met the chief of police once.

11:28.668 --> 11:31.034
Ham!
He did somethin' to be proud of.

11:31.104 --> 11:33.436
Had a dream and went for it.

11:33.506 --> 11:36.873
- <i>You got dreams?</i>
- I'm living my dream.

11:36.943 --> 11:39.104
Whoa!

11:39.178 --> 11:41.976
Uh, Houston? We have a problem.

11:43.316 --> 11:45.841
<i>Thanks for supporting your government.</i>

11:45.918 --> 11:48.512
Under threat of prosecution!

11:48.588 --> 11:51.921
<i>I- I'm- I'm gonna</i>
<i>need that trailer back.</i>

11:51.991 --> 11:56.018
- Huh.
- Well, looks like we're gonna
need a new cannonball.

11:56.095 --> 11:59.587
You like to travel?

12:02.101 --> 12:04.092
- Here he comes.
- Stand proud.

12:04.170 --> 12:07.697
I can't believe it. We'll be flying
with the grandson of the great Ham.

12:09.008 --> 12:11.602
<i>You sure they said "grandson"?</i>

12:11.677 --> 12:15.078
- Whoa! I know my rights.
I'm calling the A.S.P.C. A!
- Huh?

12:15.148 --> 12:17.639
I demand to talk to my ringmaster!
Help! I've been kidnapped!

12:17.717 --> 12:20.447
Oh, he's clearly excited
to be in a new environment.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.454
Oh, God!

12:22.522 --> 12:24.752
Good glass. Ow!

12:26.959 --> 12:28.620
Commander Titan,
navigation and coordinates.

12:28.694 --> 12:31.128
Ham. Don't and care.

12:31.197 --> 12:34.428
Lieutenant Luna.
It's an honor, sir.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.594
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
- <i> Yeah. Oh, my.</i>

12:37.670 --> 12:42.300
Hello, lady chimp.
Do not mind if I "dooble."

12:42.375 --> 12:44.843
Luna means moon in Latin.

12:44.911 --> 12:46.845
That's right, sir.

12:46.913 --> 12:50.076
- What do ya know? Two lovers of language.
- <i>Name's Comet.</i>

12:50.149 --> 12:53.482
Computers and electronics.
I look forward to serving with you.

12:53.553 --> 12:56.784
Sorry, kid, but I gotta play Poughkeepsie
on Saturday. Let's go, Houston!

12:56.856 --> 13:00.087
Sir, with all due respect,
you've been selected for a mission...

13:00.159 --> 13:02.650
<i>of historical significance</i>
<i>in the noble pursuit of-</i>

13:02.728 --> 13:04.958
Land of the free, home of the brave.
Yada, yada, yada.

13:05.031 --> 13:09.092
<i>Listen, the only mission I have</i>
<i>is to entertain. Watch and learn.</i>

13:09.168 --> 13:12.001
- Abracadabble.
- <i> Oh, cool!</i>

13:12.071 --> 13:16.303
Oh, perfect. He's a joke.

13:16.375 --> 13:19.208
Anyway, best of luck, break a leg,
blast off-Whatever it is you say.

13:19.278 --> 13:21.269
But I gotta bounce.

13:24.917 --> 13:27.317
What are those?

13:27.386 --> 13:30.480
Rocket packs. We'll be demonstrating them
to the press Saturday morning.

13:33.226 --> 13:35.751
My ticket home.

13:39.699 --> 13:43.066
Quake with fear!
Lord Zartog is here.

13:53.913 --> 13:56.006
Ho!

13:56.082 --> 13:59.279
By now, you are all aware
of the insane power...

13:59.352 --> 14:04.551
I command with my big, shiny
driving machine whatchamathingie.

14:06.926 --> 14:10.123
Are there any among you
who oppose my rule?

14:10.196 --> 14:12.130
Ah, wait.

14:12.198 --> 14:16.760
So you're saying you're in charge
because that thing landed on your hut?

14:16.836 --> 14:21.068
Yes, and if you don't obey me,
I will dunk you in the Freznar.

14:21.140 --> 14:24.439
You wouldn't do that
'cause I'd be frozen forever.

14:24.510 --> 14:27.570
- Exactly!
- Not the Freznar!

14:39.425 --> 14:41.359
Cold!

14:41.427 --> 14:43.861
Anyone else fancy a dip?

14:43.930 --> 14:46.490
Good.

14:46.566 --> 14:48.557
All of you, get to work!

14:49.702 --> 14:52.296
Let's get this party started.

14:52.371 --> 14:55.272
The <i>Infinity</i> recorded 10 G's
through the wormhole.

14:55.341 --> 14:58.708
<i>If the chimps' internal structure</i>
<i>cannot withstand the pressure...</i>

14:58.778 --> 15:01.576
<i>they will explode like a mouse in a microwave...</i>

15:01.647 --> 15:04.115
<i>frying their brains</i>
<i>and splattering their guts.</i>

15:04.183 --> 15:06.310
Your teeth look amazing!

15:07.687 --> 15:11.418
Here comes five G's.
Here comes six G's.

15:11.490 --> 15:14.459
This thing is going so fast, right?

15:17.163 --> 15:19.495
Yoo-hoo!

15:19.565 --> 15:21.465
Seven G's. Eight G's.

15:23.869 --> 15:26.337
<i>This might be a weird time to ask...</i>

15:26.405 --> 15:28.839
but will you help me
move next week?

15:28.908 --> 15:31.900
<i>It's not even that much stuff.</i>
<i>We'll make a day of it!</i>

15:42.788 --> 15:44.983
Hey, that was fun.

15:45.057 --> 15:46.991
- You guys got a log ride?
- My turn.

15:47.059 --> 15:51.155
- Oh, poor little Comet.
He thinks he's going into space.

15:51.230 --> 15:53.221
<i>Three chairs, three chimps.</i>

15:55.534 --> 15:57.468
Gee, where we heading for lunch?

15:57.536 --> 16:00.369
I'm not eating trans fats anymore.
Well, that went well.

16:00.439 --> 16:04.170
We'll need you here, Comet. Our eyes and ears.

16:04.243 --> 16:07.041
Hey, kid.

16:07.113 --> 16:11.447
Did I ever tell you the story of the short-circuiting
posigrades in the first Mercury rockets?

16:11.517 --> 16:13.451
That was you?

16:13.519 --> 16:16.682
<i>It was the day Ham's grandpa</i>
<i>and I coined the term...</i>

16:16.756 --> 16:19.350
"So easy a human could do it."

16:19.425 --> 16:22.053
Oh, I don't know
what makes me happier-

16:22.128 --> 16:24.187
Einstein's unified field theory...

16:24.263 --> 16:26.322
or watching monkeys on a treadmill.

16:26.399 --> 16:29.061
# I am Titan, I am strong #

16:29.135 --> 16:31.797
# No one wants to sing along #

16:31.871 --> 16:33.964
# Get a life, one, two #

16:34.040 --> 16:36.235
<i># You're lame Three, four##</i>

16:36.309 --> 16:38.038
What?

16:41.414 --> 16:44.577
And to think, I almost dropped out of Harvard
to start a software company.

16:44.650 --> 16:46.845
Who's laughing now, Bill Gates?

16:46.919 --> 16:50.582
Memorizing sequences is a vital test
of the chimps' brain capacity.

17:02.835 --> 17:04.859
You guys into sweet jams?

17:16.982 --> 17:19.916
When are you gonna
straighten up and fly right?

17:21.354 --> 17:24.380
- Saturday, about 10:00 a.m.
- Ham!

17:24.457 --> 17:27.550
I made these radios for the voyage. I think
they might work through the wormhole.

17:27.626 --> 17:30.925
- Huh. You made these?
- Well, I'm good with machines.

17:30.996 --> 17:34.261
Listen, kid, thanks for the Bananaberry,
but I won't be needing it.

17:34.333 --> 17:37.302
Comet, I'll take the radio.

17:37.370 --> 17:39.804
Uh- Hey, kid.

17:39.872 --> 17:42.204
Special-edition simian space shades.

17:42.274 --> 17:44.299
Wow! Thanks!

17:44.377 --> 17:46.311
Sweet!

17:49.615 --> 17:54.484
My fellow citizens, this mission
will travel clear across the cosmos...

17:54.553 --> 17:58.250
where we hope to finally answer
the age-old question:

17:58.324 --> 18:01.316
"Is there intelligent life out there?"

18:01.394 --> 18:03.259
Review rocket controls.

18:03.329 --> 18:06.298
Right thumb go, left thumb stop.
Up is right, down is left.

18:06.365 --> 18:09.061
- You got that?
- Yeah, yeah. Right thumb go, left thumb stop.

18:09.135 --> 18:12.901
Now you're seein' it, now you're not.
Boop, boop. Where'd it go?

18:12.972 --> 18:15.440
Here it is.
Hi! I was hiding.

18:15.508 --> 18:17.339
Oh! You're missing a link.

18:17.410 --> 18:20.243
Chimp up, cannonball.
You're not in the circus anymore.

18:20.312 --> 18:22.439
<i>Making this giant leap</i>
<i>through the wormhole...</i>

18:22.515 --> 18:25.814
<i>comes at great risk and danger.</i>

18:25.885 --> 18:28.012
<i>Who will blaze this trail for us?</i>

18:28.087 --> 18:31.284
The few, the proud...

18:31.357 --> 18:33.291
<i>the monkeys!</i>

18:43.369 --> 18:45.860
- Awesome!
- A historic moment.

18:45.938 --> 18:51.706
<i>And here he is-a symbol of our country's</i>
<i>once and future greatness...</i>

18:51.777 --> 18:54.507
<i>Ham the Third!</i>

18:54.580 --> 18:56.571
Thank you, thank you. Hey!

18:56.649 --> 19:01.951
To the circus and beyo-

19:02.021 --> 19:04.216
That's gotta hurt.

19:04.290 --> 19:06.349
Wait! Oh, no.

19:06.425 --> 19:09.121
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

19:09.195 --> 19:10.822
How much fuel is in that backpack?

19:10.896 --> 19:11.885
- Oh, boy.
- Cool!

19:11.964 --> 19:15.525
Ah, wrong way!

19:15.601 --> 19:17.728
Incoming!

19:17.803 --> 19:20.067
- Chimps gone wild.
- Uh-oh! Oh, no!

19:20.139 --> 19:22.073
Holy nards!

19:22.141 --> 19:24.041
- Heads up!
- Save the children!

19:24.109 --> 19:26.009
Run for your lives!

19:26.078 --> 19:28.672
Whoa! Wow! Oh! Huh?

19:28.747 --> 19:30.840
Hey, look! I'm on TV!

19:30.916 --> 19:33.714
Oh! Whoa, no!

19:41.427 --> 19:43.258
- Crazy monkey!
- He's a maniac!

19:48.300 --> 19:50.860
Oh, that's not good.

19:52.605 --> 19:53.936
He's a joke!

20:00.913 --> 20:02.710
Oh.

20:02.781 --> 20:05.375
Whoo-hoo!

20:05.451 --> 20:07.442
Which way to the circus?

20:08.988 --> 20:10.888
Huh? Uh-oh.

20:16.762 --> 20:19.993
Ta-da!

20:21.600 --> 20:23.591
- <i> Load 'em up.</i>

20:32.578 --> 20:36.036
What kind of simulator is this?
It looks really realistic.

20:36.115 --> 20:37.776
Oh, it is.

21:07.079 --> 21:09.673
Okay. I got that out of my system.

21:12.384 --> 21:16.047
Wait. Not quite yet.

21:20.993 --> 21:24.360
Okay. I'm good.
Now, where are we?

21:47.753 --> 21:49.846
<i>Uh, guys?</i>

21:55.761 --> 21:58.321
The simulated Earth's
getting smaller and smaller.

22:00.132 --> 22:02.760
<i>This isn't a simulation, is it?</i>

22:02.835 --> 22:05.736
We are now officially space chimps.

22:18.784 --> 22:21.480
<i> The</i> Horizon <i>has</i>
<i>completed its first phase of operation.</i>

22:21.553 --> 22:24.386
Oh, wonderful!

22:24.456 --> 22:27.186
- There you go.
- # Congratulations to us #

22:27.259 --> 22:29.250
- Ha!
- Yeah!

22:45.010 --> 22:47.035
No, that's not straight enough.

22:47.112 --> 22:49.808
No, no. Now that-
No, it's too straight.

22:49.882 --> 22:53.010
Who is this?
I don't remember dunking him.

22:53.085 --> 22:56.953
No, no! You're doing it all wrong!

22:57.022 --> 22:59.456
Move the Flanderk higher.

22:59.525 --> 23:01.516
<i>Line up the twobs in a row.</i>

23:02.795 --> 23:06.891
<i>Careful with that!</i>
<i>It took me all day to dunk.</i>

23:06.965 --> 23:09.729
- Splork!
- Yes, Lord Zartog?

23:09.802 --> 23:13.533
- Kneel to Lord Zartog.
- Yes, Lord Zartog.

23:13.605 --> 23:16.301
Soon the house of Zartog
will be finished.

23:16.375 --> 23:20.106
It's going to be magnificent!

23:20.179 --> 23:23.876
It's a shame the volcano will destroy it
when the three suns line up on Triple Sunday.

23:23.949 --> 23:26.281
I'm one step ahead of that volcano.

23:26.351 --> 23:28.410
That's why I'm building those.

23:29.688 --> 23:32.248
<i>These pipes will divert</i>
<i>the Freznar safely away.</i>

23:32.324 --> 23:35.885
<i>Nothing will ever destroy</i>
<i>the house of Zartog.</i>

23:35.961 --> 23:39.795
<i>But if you divert</i>
<i>the volcano's Freznar...</i>

23:39.865 --> 23:41.856
the entire village will be buried.

23:41.934 --> 23:45.995
Exactly! A glorious reflecting pool
to reflect my gloriousness...

23:46.071 --> 23:48.005
gloriously.

23:48.073 --> 23:51.372
- Eh, but-but-but where would we all live?
- With me, in my dungeon.

23:51.443 --> 23:54.241
How gracious of you, my lord.

23:54.913 --> 23:58.815
<i>Commander's log. Stardate: now.</i>

23:58.884 --> 24:01.751
Space, the final frontier.
I have bravely led-

24:01.820 --> 24:04.880
- Oh, stewardess?
Can you get me a pillow and a blanket?
- Stay in your seat.

24:04.957 --> 24:07.790
- It's regulation.
- I have bravely led my-

24:07.860 --> 24:09.794
Look! No hands, no feet. No tail.

24:09.862 --> 24:13.127
Back on Earth, your insubordinate behavior
would get you chimp-martialed!

24:13.198 --> 24:15.530
- You're not gonna do that
the whole trip, are you?
- What?

24:15.601 --> 24:17.967
Use "chimp" to replace real phrases.

24:18.036 --> 24:20.334
I tell ya. I'm gonna kill him.

24:20.405 --> 24:23.465
Commander! Violence
is against the primate directive.

24:23.542 --> 24:27.034
- You're right, Lieutenant.
- Is love against the primate directive?

24:27.112 --> 24:29.205
- <i>Aah!</i>
- Listen and learn, cannonball.

24:29.281 --> 24:32.148
- <i>The approach sequence</i>
<i>must be activated in order.</i>

24:32.217 --> 24:36.153
Fire the engines true and fast.
Red one first, blue one last.

24:36.221 --> 24:41.056
In between, press 3-6-5
if you want to stay alive.

24:41.126 --> 24:43.060
- Permission to speak, Commander?
- Permission granted.

24:43.128 --> 24:45.119
- You're a dork.
- I don't like you.

24:45.197 --> 24:47.893
Engaging 3-D matrix.

24:47.966 --> 24:50.230
- Ready visual imaging.
- Fire photon torpedoes!

24:50.302 --> 24:53.396
- Aah!
- It's go time, cannonball.

24:53.472 --> 24:55.736
Oh, yeah? Prove it.

24:55.808 --> 24:58.538
- Titan, don't!
- You are a threat to the mission!

24:58.610 --> 25:00.635
Ta-da!

25:00.712 --> 25:03.738
- Oops. I'm sorry. What do you think
we should name our kids?

25:03.816 --> 25:05.807
What? I'm gonna take off.

25:05.884 --> 25:08.216
- You're goin' down!
- Orbital stabilizers. Check.

25:08.287 --> 25:11.415
- Hey, is this your card? Is this your card?
- Auxiliary thrusters, check.

25:11.490 --> 25:13.549
- Collision detector, check.
- <i>Circus freak!</i>

25:13.625 --> 25:18.562
- Not your card, huh?
- I can't take this for another 73 light-years!

25:18.630 --> 25:20.757
- I gotcha! Here it comes!
- Hang in there.

25:20.833 --> 25:22.767
Ding-dong-Aah!

25:22.835 --> 25:24.769
Easy on the fur, furious George.

25:24.837 --> 25:26.771
Unruly crew member has been detained.

25:26.839 --> 25:29.137
- Ow!
- Enact regulation number 815.

25:29.208 --> 25:32.041
What's regulation 815?

25:33.612 --> 25:35.546
Guys!

25:35.614 --> 25:37.548
I gotta pee!

25:37.616 --> 25:40.915
Whoo! Talk about suction!

25:40.986 --> 25:44.854
- Ugh.
- Oh, and by the way, guys,
we lost the toilet paper.

25:44.923 --> 25:46.914
<i>Not my fault.</i>

25:48.227 --> 25:50.991
- <i> Thrusters aligned for entry.</i>
- <i> Wow.</i>

25:51.063 --> 25:53.998
Am I glad we're not goin'
into that crazy-lookin' thing.

25:54.066 --> 25:57.001
Sorry. While on the mission
I can only hear real astronauts.

25:57.069 --> 25:59.264
Then who did you just say sorry to?

26:00.639 --> 26:03.904
- Someone else.
- Then why did you just say "someone else"?

26:03.976 --> 26:05.967
- Jerk-boy!
- <i>Nitpicker!</i>

26:06.044 --> 26:08.979
- <i> Poop-thrower!</i>
- <i> Maybe there's some music on the radio.</i>

26:09.047 --> 26:12.448
<i># Hey, monkey-rena #</i>

26:12.517 --> 26:14.712
<i> Circus freak!</i>

26:14.786 --> 26:16.720
Approaching dimensional anomaly entry.

26:16.788 --> 26:18.915
Brace for event threshold.

26:24.463 --> 26:28.490
<i>Approaching five G's-Six G's!</i>

26:29.768 --> 26:31.759
Eight G's!

26:34.973 --> 26:37.567
<i>Must... stay... alert.</i>

26:37.643 --> 26:40.009
Losing... consciousness...

26:40.078 --> 26:42.012
- now.
- Titan!

26:42.080 --> 26:44.674
Whoa! Whoa!

26:44.750 --> 26:46.775
Come on! Come on!
Where's reverse on this thing?

26:46.852 --> 26:49.616
- Welcome to InStar.
- Oh, thank God.

26:49.688 --> 26:52.748
How can I help you?

27:08.240 --> 27:10.333
Horizon <i>has entered the wormhole.</i>

27:10.409 --> 27:13.344
- Marvelous!
- We'll reacquire signal
in 12 minutes, 20 seconds.

27:13.412 --> 27:17.109
- This better work.
- We got three chimps strapped
into a $3.7 billion spaceship.

27:17.182 --> 27:19.116
What could go wrong?

27:19.184 --> 27:22.278
Whoa-ho-ho! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

27:22.354 --> 27:26.757
<i>Hey, cool, a planet.</i>
<i>And we're headed right for it.</i>

27:26.825 --> 27:29.658
Oh, my God,
we're headed right for it!

27:31.063 --> 27:33.395
Wake up! Wake up!
You gotta land this thing!

27:34.933 --> 27:36.525
Okay, no need to panic.

27:36.601 --> 27:38.796
You're just hurtling out of a wormhole
on the other side of the universe...

27:38.870 --> 27:40.804
at 9,000 miles an hour and no brakes!

27:40.872 --> 27:42.806
Pull up! Come on!

27:42.874 --> 27:45.035
Steering wheel!

27:46.812 --> 27:50.248
Please let one of these be a force field.
Please, please, please!

27:52.217 --> 27:54.583
- <i> Air bags deployed.</i>
- I did it!

27:54.653 --> 27:57.019
I am the smartest chimp
in the universe!

27:57.089 --> 27:58.716
Whoo-

28:12.004 --> 28:13.995
No-oh-oh! Aaah!

28:18.977 --> 28:20.672
Ow.

28:20.746 --> 28:23.909
Whew.
Well, that wasn't so bad.

28:23.982 --> 28:25.973
<i>Ship stabilized.</i>

28:31.156 --> 28:34.614
<i>Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! Whoa!</i>

28:39.297 --> 28:45.236
<i>Reacquire signal in five,</i>
<i>four, three, two, one.</i>

28:49.708 --> 28:53.940
I'm heading to Kinko's later if anybody
wants me to run off their résumé.

28:54.012 --> 28:55.946
You lost the ship?

28:56.014 --> 28:58.881
It must be some sort of
technical malfunction.

28:58.950 --> 29:01.384
Burning microwave popcorn
is a technical malfunction.

29:01.453 --> 29:04.581
This is a billion-dollar disaster!

29:04.656 --> 29:06.590
3.7, to be exact.

29:06.658 --> 29:10.150
Look on the bright side- if they don't come back,
we save five grand on cake and balloons.

29:10.228 --> 29:14.164
We can always count on
the 24-hour fail-safe restart system.

29:14.232 --> 29:16.666
You have 24 hours
to bring back those chimps...

29:16.735 --> 29:19.329
or I'll cut your funding
and make this space program history!

29:19.404 --> 29:21.463
And I mean every cent.

29:21.540 --> 29:23.940
You won't even be able
to afford pocket protectors.

29:24.009 --> 29:26.068
You monster!

29:26.144 --> 29:29.910
Remember, no bucks, no Buck Rogers.

29:33.051 --> 29:35.178
Oh. I love Buck Rogers.

29:35.253 --> 29:37.187
Who is Buck Rogers?

29:37.255 --> 29:39.189
They lost contact!

29:39.257 --> 29:41.817
Comet to Luna. Come in, Luna.

29:41.893 --> 29:43.827
Must be solar flare interference.

29:43.895 --> 29:46.887
I'll hack the mainframe
to filter the signal.

29:49.234 --> 29:52.931
<i>Shoot,</i>
<i>in my day we just yelled louder.</i>

29:53.171 --> 29:55.002
Oh, great.

29:55.073 --> 29:56.836
<i>We landed in Barstow.</i>

30:01.213 --> 30:03.613
Let's see. Elephant's peanut chest.

30:03.682 --> 30:07.015
No, not that one.
Circus mess hall. Ringmaster's Yugo.

30:07.085 --> 30:10.612
Houston's banana closet- Hmm.

30:16.361 --> 30:18.625
Whoa.

30:18.697 --> 30:21.666
One small step for Ham...

30:21.733 --> 30:24.827
one more small step for Ham...

30:24.903 --> 30:26.803
and yet another small step-

30:26.872 --> 30:28.806
What are you doing out here?

30:28.874 --> 30:30.808
Whoa!

30:30.876 --> 30:32.673
Testing for gravity?

30:32.744 --> 30:35.042
- Yeah, it works.
- Who authorized you to open the hatch?

30:35.113 --> 30:36.580
Commander.

30:36.648 --> 30:38.548
Commander?

30:38.617 --> 30:41.142
You are a liability to this mission.

30:41.219 --> 30:43.153
Ha! Liability?

30:43.221 --> 30:46.748
I was steering this crate while you and
Commander Coma were sawing logs!

30:46.825 --> 30:50.090
You stayed awake, and you didn't
activate the landing sequence?

30:50.162 --> 30:52.153
- That's all you had to do.
- Not true.

30:52.230 --> 30:54.425
I was catching up on my panicking.

30:54.499 --> 30:56.433
No! Don't!

30:56.501 --> 30:58.867
- What?
- The air could be poisonous!

30:58.937 --> 31:00.962
Oh, no!

31:01.039 --> 31:04.406
Poisonous air!

31:05.911 --> 31:07.845
- Lieutenant's log.
- <i>Choking.</i>

31:07.913 --> 31:10.074
- <i>Air is breathable.</i>
- Gasping.

31:10.148 --> 31:14.414
- The temperature is normal.
- Dying.

31:14.486 --> 31:16.545
Winning daytime Emmy.

31:16.621 --> 31:19.852
And there is no sign of intelligent life.

31:19.925 --> 31:22.189
Blah!

31:22.260 --> 31:25.058
Look, the planet has three suns.

31:25.130 --> 31:26.961
<i>Amazing.</i>

31:27.032 --> 31:30.524
Just like every science fiction movie involving
another planet guessed there would be.

31:34.005 --> 31:38.908
As you all know,
tomorrow is Triple Sunday!

31:38.977 --> 31:43.641
<i>Our three suns will come together as one</i>
<i>and the volcano will explode!</i>

31:43.715 --> 31:47.446
<i>And in honor of this special day,</i>
<i>and more importantly, me...</i>

31:47.519 --> 31:50.920
I'm throwing a celebration,
a sort of palace-warming party.

31:50.989 --> 31:53.219
- Your overlord!
- What?

31:53.291 --> 31:56.226
- Another metal beast fell from the sky!
- A metal beast?

31:56.294 --> 31:58.228
- Like this one?
- Only bigger!

31:58.296 --> 32:00.457
Only bigger! Only bigger!

32:00.532 --> 32:03.467
- Bigger than mine?
- It's not the size of the beast.

32:03.535 --> 32:06.470
It's what you do with it
that matters, my lord.

32:06.538 --> 32:08.165
- Traitor!
- I-I'm not a traitor!

32:08.240 --> 32:10.970
- Then take it back.
- Uh, okay. I take it back.

32:11.042 --> 32:13.909
You can't take it back,
now it's out there. They all heard.

32:13.979 --> 32:16.311
<i>You all heard, right?</i>

32:20.352 --> 32:22.946
- Oh!
- Splork!

32:23.021 --> 32:26.149
- Uh, me?
- Congratulations! You're the general.

32:26.224 --> 32:28.692
Take a party of warriors
and bring me the sky beast.

32:28.760 --> 32:32.321
Uh, okay, the tall guy,
you with the red belly...

32:32.397 --> 32:35.560
<i>guy with the pointy hat</i>
<i>and the splotchy one at the back.</i>

32:35.634 --> 32:37.795
I'm always picked last.

32:37.869 --> 32:39.803
Mount up!

32:45.577 --> 32:49.377
<i>Take the Fluvians!</i>

32:55.020 --> 32:59.889
<i>Imagine, we're the first astronauts</i>
<i>to ever set foot on this planet.</i>

32:59.958 --> 33:02.392
<i>These photos will be front-page news.</i>

33:02.460 --> 33:04.655
The most important images
of the century!

33:04.729 --> 33:06.663
Can you get one of my good side?

33:06.731 --> 33:08.722
Oops. Forgot. I'm all good side.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.633
Maybe take one of me looking heroically,
with my chin like this?

33:11.703 --> 33:13.637
- Oh, and another one like this.
- <i>Clown.</i>

33:13.705 --> 33:15.730
Ever alert. Brooding.

33:15.807 --> 33:19.038
Poised to strike. Candid.

33:19.110 --> 33:21.237
Laughing candid.

33:21.313 --> 33:23.247
I've been naughty.

33:24.983 --> 33:27.577
Huh? Hmm.

33:27.652 --> 33:30.314
Wait, Luna.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

33:30.388 --> 33:33.323
This is the first sign of complex life
on an alien planet!

33:33.391 --> 33:36.758
- Astronauts gather knowledge. It's what we do.
- I'd just be a little careful.

33:36.828 --> 33:38.762
You? Careful?

33:38.830 --> 33:41.765
I'm just saying, <i>that</i> looks like a flower
used by Piddles the Clown.

33:41.833 --> 33:44.028
I gotta hear this.

33:44.102 --> 33:46.036
<i>Piddles is a very cute clown...</i>

33:46.104 --> 33:49.369
<i>who has a cute little box</i>
<i>covered with cute little flowers.</i>

33:49.441 --> 33:53.241
<i>The kids think it's the sweetest thing</i>
<i>they've ever seen, until-</i>

33:53.311 --> 33:55.404
Boo! A giant snake pops out.

33:55.480 --> 33:58.938
Please. I'm a trained astronaut.
I know what I'm doing.

33:59.017 --> 34:01.679
Trained astronaut?
Space chimps are a joke.

34:01.753 --> 34:04.688
Is that what you think
of your grandfather?

34:04.756 --> 34:07.418
Just pick your flowers
and let's get back to Earth.

34:07.492 --> 34:10.949
If there's no traffic in the wormhole,
I can still make the 8:00 show at the circus.

34:11.029 --> 34:15.261
- Uptight, scientific, bookworm chimp lady.
- Hmm.

34:21.339 --> 34:24.502
- What does Piddles do next?
- He usually throws a bucket
of confetti on the audience...

34:24.576 --> 34:26.908
and then runs around
smashing pies in his own face.

34:28.813 --> 34:31.077
I don't think that's gonna help us here.

34:31.149 --> 34:34.380
My <i>Simian Space Manual.</i> There must
be something in here about what to do.

34:34.452 --> 34:36.386
"Alien captures. Alien uprisings.

34:36.454 --> 34:39.286
- How to say no to an alien probe."
- Manual override!

34:43.061 --> 34:46.496
Confetti. I can't explain it.
It just scares things.

34:46.563 --> 34:49.226
- You sure they're not scared of them?
- Huh?

34:51.168 --> 34:54.661
I know this sounds crazy, but I think
these guys are gonna be super chill.

34:54.739 --> 34:58.436
- Death to strangers!
- Ooh, great name for a band.

35:01.045 --> 35:03.240
Titan! Wake up!

35:03.314 --> 35:05.509
The sky beast is ours!

35:05.583 --> 35:07.312
Quick, this way!

35:07.385 --> 35:11.253
- But we can't leave the ship, or Titan!
- Looks like they're leavin' us.

35:11.322 --> 35:15.019
Return to Lord Zartog!

35:15.093 --> 35:18.256
Titan!

35:18.329 --> 35:20.695
Get them! Fire!

35:23.101 --> 35:25.092
You should've never left the ship!
This is all your fault!

35:25.170 --> 35:26.797
Me? I didn't sign up for this!

35:26.871 --> 35:30.705
I should be in the makeup trailer,
not stuck on an alien planet, saving you!

35:30.775 --> 35:35.474
<i>You saving me? I'm the astronaut here.</i>
<i>You're just a P.R. stunt!</i>

35:37.749 --> 35:40.684
Wow, you are really sinking low.

35:40.752 --> 35:42.686
Yeah, well, you deserve it.

35:42.754 --> 35:45.518
- No. I mean you're literally getting lower.
We're sinking!
- Aah!

35:45.590 --> 35:47.615
I can't get out!

35:47.692 --> 35:52.220
Like we say in the circus, " The show ain't over
till the bearded lady shaves her back!"

35:52.297 --> 35:55.630
- Ew.
- It's as gross as it sounds too.

35:56.568 --> 35:58.832
Ham!

35:58.903 --> 36:02.737
Climb on my shoulders and grab that vine!

36:05.109 --> 36:07.634
Excuse me. That's my leg.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.541
- They're in the swamp!
- Attack!

36:10.615 --> 36:13.243
- Now what?
- Swing, very stiff one.

36:13.318 --> 36:16.515
Swing like the wind!
Release your inner chimp!

36:17.555 --> 36:19.989
Come on, Luna.
Like you're on a trapeze.

36:20.058 --> 36:24.688
- I'm not from the circus.
- Life's a circus, Luna. Only the tents get bigger.

36:24.762 --> 36:27.492
Fire!

36:27.565 --> 36:29.999
Tarzan yell!

36:31.002 --> 36:35.496
Ham! I can't do this! I'm gonna fall!

36:35.573 --> 36:39.873
- Yes, you can, Luna! You can do this!
- I can't!

36:39.944 --> 36:43.675
Use your shoulders, kick your legs,
swing and let go.

36:43.748 --> 36:47.240
Shoulders, legs, swing, let go.

36:47.318 --> 36:51.584
Shoulders, legs, swing, let go.

36:51.656 --> 36:54.716
- Nice! There you go. You're getting it!
- Shoulders, legs, swing.

36:54.792 --> 36:57.420
- Let go!
- You're gettin' it! The chimp has been released!

36:57.495 --> 37:00.794
Swing, let go.
Hey, check this out, Ham!

37:00.865 --> 37:03.698
Whoo!

37:03.768 --> 37:06.703
- No!
- <i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

37:06.771 --> 37:09.069
- See? Nothing to it!
- Ham!

37:09.140 --> 37:13.406
Just a couple of chimps swingin' through
a jungle of vines with eyes and mouths.

37:14.646 --> 37:16.273
Eyes and mouths!

37:16.347 --> 37:18.645
Snake one, meet snake two.

37:18.716 --> 37:20.980
Whoo-hoo!

37:21.052 --> 37:24.385
- Get them!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

37:27.659 --> 37:29.957
- Ham, help!
- Luna!

37:30.028 --> 37:32.963
Whoo-hoo!

37:33.031 --> 37:35.329
It's showtime!

37:35.400 --> 37:37.129
Afternoon, ladies.

37:42.674 --> 37:44.904
- Some first date, huh?
- This is not a date.

37:44.976 --> 37:48.412
Oh, yes, it is.
And I really hope to see you again.

37:48.479 --> 37:50.777
Because we're about to... fall!

37:50.848 --> 37:53.442
Ham, what do we do now?

37:53.518 --> 37:55.418
Aim for the soft patch.

37:55.486 --> 37:59.923
Spread your arms wide.
Chin down. Thumbs in.

37:59.991 --> 38:02.186
- I hope you know what you're doing.
- Are you kidding me?

38:02.260 --> 38:04.455
I do this every day of the week.

38:04.529 --> 38:06.360
Except Monday. That's my me day.

38:07.198 --> 38:09.223
Ham?

38:09.300 --> 38:11.928
Luna, chin down.

38:12.003 --> 38:13.834
Ham!

38:17.909 --> 38:20.275
Whoo!

38:20.345 --> 38:23.280
Ham?

38:23.348 --> 38:25.373
Ham? You're okay, right?

38:25.450 --> 38:27.782
Ham, get up.

38:27.852 --> 38:30.116
Come on, Ham.

38:30.188 --> 38:33.282
I'm sorry I was rough on you.

38:33.358 --> 38:38.022
Sure, you were irresponsible,
dangerous and undisciplined...

38:38.096 --> 38:40.189
but you saved my life.

38:40.264 --> 38:45.065
And you were kind of funny in an
unbelievably annoying way. And you were-

38:45.136 --> 38:47.070
- Cute?
- No.

38:47.138 --> 38:48.696
- Handsome?
- No.

38:48.773 --> 38:50.798
Like Brad Pitt,
but way shorter and more hairy?

38:50.875 --> 38:52.206
What?

38:52.410 --> 38:54.071
Luna, do you copy?

38:54.145 --> 38:56.579
- Let me just say one thing.
- Luna's alive.

38:56.648 --> 39:00.379
You are the most annoying, obnoxious,
self-centered creature I have ever met.

39:00.451 --> 39:03.386
- Ham's alive.
- Luna? Ham? Do you read me? Come in.

39:03.454 --> 39:05.388
You're an embarrassment.

39:05.456 --> 39:07.686
We can hear them,
but they can't hear us.

39:07.759 --> 39:10.091
We'll need to calibrate
the Gregorian array...

39:10.161 --> 39:12.595
replace the helix mirror
and cross-feed the surrounding shroud.

39:12.664 --> 39:15.656
The only word I understood was "feed."

39:15.733 --> 39:19.225
Mission log. We are stranded
on a hostile alien planet.

39:19.303 --> 39:21.237
Commander Titan has been kidnapped.

39:21.305 --> 39:23.239
- And we're falling in love!
- No, we're not!

39:23.307 --> 39:25.901
Ignore that last part. Delete! Delete!

39:25.977 --> 39:28.844
- Kidnapped?
- Stranded? We gotta get movin', kid.

39:28.913 --> 39:31.313
We've lost our ship
and have only 22 hours...

39:31.382 --> 39:34.351
before the automatic pilot engages
and we're stuck here forever.

39:34.419 --> 39:36.353
Whoa. What?
What do you mean, "stuck"?

39:36.421 --> 39:40.380
The ship has a safety program to automatically
fly back to Earth 24 hours after we land.

39:40.458 --> 39:42.392
It was in your manual.

39:42.460 --> 39:47.090
Was that before or after the chapter on the
fleet of rescue ships they'll send to save us?

39:47.165 --> 39:50.464
- Ham, we got one chance of getting home.
- I've had worse odds than that.

39:50.535 --> 39:52.526
Let's get moving.

40:02.046 --> 40:05.880
Behold Sky Beast Two, the sequel!

40:05.950 --> 40:07.474
Yes!

40:07.552 --> 40:09.042
Greetings, aliens!

40:11.122 --> 40:13.818
<i>Don't worry. You didn't wake me.</i>

40:13.891 --> 40:15.950
I needed to get up.

40:16.027 --> 40:17.961
I am Commander Titan.

40:18.029 --> 40:21.055
I have traveled through space
in search of knowledge...

40:21.132 --> 40:23.066
to explore the outer reaches
of the universe...

40:23.134 --> 40:26.331
make first contact with aliens
like yourselves...

40:26.404 --> 40:30.738
seal you in Mylar wrap and take you
to my home planet to be dissected.

40:30.808 --> 40:33.140
- Dissected?
- Oh, you know.

40:33.211 --> 40:37.409
We lay you down on some nice wax paper,
slice you open with a butter knife.

40:37.482 --> 40:38.471
Oh?

40:38.549 --> 40:40.540
But first, you'll need to form a line...

40:40.618 --> 40:43.849
so that I can label and catalog you.

40:44.989 --> 40:47.924
Organism one, organism two-

40:47.992 --> 40:49.960
Organism three.

40:50.027 --> 40:53.258
I am Lord Zartog,
ruler of the planet Malgor.

40:53.331 --> 40:56.300
Zartog, eh?
Your parents named you that?

40:56.367 --> 40:58.597
'Cause you are different.

40:58.669 --> 41:02.036
I like you. Is that, uh, with one "G" or two?

41:02.106 --> 41:04.267
- I'll take that as a one.

41:07.345 --> 41:09.404
- Organism four, organism five.
- Ow!

41:09.480 --> 41:12.540
Ah, there's-
There's a lot of you. Whoa.

41:12.617 --> 41:15.051
<i>Whoa there, mister.</i>
<i>That's space agency property.</i>

41:15.119 --> 41:19.681
You're in direct violation
of interstellar protocol.

41:19.757 --> 41:23.989
But, if you cooperate with me,
I will ask the tribunal to go easy on you.

41:24.061 --> 41:27.622
Cooperate with you?
I'm going to destroy you.

41:27.698 --> 41:30.895
I appreciate your honesty.
You're a good man, "Zartig."

41:30.968 --> 41:32.833
And a worthy adversary.

41:32.904 --> 41:36.465
- Be proud.
- Prepare to be frozen forever.

41:36.541 --> 41:41.240
Ha! You don't even know how to use
the reticulating micromovement device.

41:41.312 --> 41:44.338
Even a first-year cadet
knows how to do that.

41:47.451 --> 41:50.750
Hmm. Will you show me
the secrets of the beast?

41:50.822 --> 41:53.814
Negativo. You're not trained.
You're not qualified.

41:53.891 --> 41:55.825
You're not even insured.

41:55.893 --> 41:58.828
Please? I'll do anything.

41:58.896 --> 42:01.091
You could help me find my crew.

42:01.165 --> 42:05.499
- There are more?
- Two others. We, uh, lost them
in Gunglevik Jungle.

42:05.570 --> 42:07.834
What kind of idiot would go in there?

42:08.539 --> 42:09.904
Ham.

42:15.980 --> 42:20.076
You gotta admit. Being on
a weird alien planet is almost cool.

42:20.151 --> 42:23.848
All my life, I dreamed of being
a real astronaut, just like your grandfather.

42:23.921 --> 42:27.857
- And here I am.
- Real astronauts? Wake up, Luna.

42:27.925 --> 42:30.553
The only reason we're here
is to see if we explode in space.

42:30.628 --> 42:33.222
You're wrong.
We are real astronauts.

42:33.297 --> 42:34.628
- Whoa.
- Ham.

42:34.699 --> 42:37.691
Which one of us
lost our flashlight... that moves...

42:37.768 --> 42:41.363
<i>really fast behind rocks</i>
<i>and has a head?</i>

42:41.439 --> 42:43.703
Cool.

42:43.774 --> 42:45.901
Please, I mean you no harm.

42:45.977 --> 42:48.275
Hi. I'm Lieutenant Luna.

42:48.346 --> 42:51.144
M-My name
is Killawallawizzaseywhoha.

42:51.215 --> 42:53.080
Oh, great. It's drunk.

42:53.150 --> 42:56.745
I'm the last free Luzian from the village
of Killawallawazoowahooweewee.

42:58.456 --> 43:00.390
We come from Earth.

43:00.458 --> 43:03.723
You know, Earth- iTunes, greenhouse gases...

43:03.794 --> 43:07.195
<i>David Beckham.</i>

43:07.265 --> 43:10.496
Whoa. What's up with
the glow-in-the-dark brain case?

43:10.568 --> 43:12.661
My head lights up when I'm scared.

43:12.737 --> 43:15.535
You don't need to be scared of us.
We're your friends.

43:15.606 --> 43:18.507
Friends.

43:25.516 --> 43:28.041
Are you alone?

43:28.119 --> 43:32.488
Yes. My village was imprisoned
by Zartog and his sky beast.

43:32.556 --> 43:36.356
Its metal claws gave him
the power to enslave the planet.

43:36.427 --> 43:40.363
Metal claws. The rover!
We, too, came from the stars.

43:40.431 --> 43:42.296
Yes. I saw you crash.

43:42.366 --> 43:45.062
You saw that? That was me!

43:45.136 --> 43:47.798
- What?
- Do you know where our ship is?

43:47.872 --> 43:49.965
- At Zartog's palace.
- Can you lead us there?

43:50.041 --> 43:54.000
- Don't worry. We'll protect you,
Killawallazallawallakillazella.

43:54.078 --> 43:57.275
Oh, let's just call her Kilowatt,
or we'll be here all day.

43:59.417 --> 44:02.284
- Or night.
- We will set off in the morning.

44:02.353 --> 44:05.379
<i>The journey is perilous.</i>
<i>We must cross through the-</i>

44:05.456 --> 44:08.653
The Valley of Very Bad Things.

44:08.726 --> 44:12.924
<i>It is a land of untold danger,</i>
<i>agony and torture...</i>

44:12.997 --> 44:15.363
not to mention avian urk flu,
death spouts...

44:15.433 --> 44:18.994
<i>mad florg disease,</i>
<i>the Cave of the Flesh-Devouring Beast...</i>

44:19.070 --> 44:23.063
and the Dark Cloud of Id
from which no one escapes unchanged!

44:25.176 --> 44:27.576
<i>Sleep. You'll need your rest.</i>

44:31.315 --> 44:35.547
I could use a little shut-eye.

44:35.619 --> 44:38.349
Stay on your side of the planet.

44:38.422 --> 44:42.586
<i> You Earthlings</i>
<i>have a funny way of showing love.</i>

44:42.660 --> 44:45.493
We do, don't we?

44:45.563 --> 44:47.497
Night, honey.

44:50.067 --> 44:53.366
Up wake, up wake.

44:53.437 --> 44:57.373
- Well, that was refreshing.
We were asleep for, like-
- Five seconds.

44:57.441 --> 45:01.070
Yep. Just one of the benefits
of living on a planet with three suns.

45:01.145 --> 45:04.581
Huh. Follow me.

45:04.648 --> 45:08.448
Listen and learn, "Zelig."

45:08.519 --> 45:14.389
The P.R. 5-13I is a high-performance,
all-purpose space exploration vehicle.

45:14.458 --> 45:16.358
<i>Rough, rugged and ready...</i>

45:16.427 --> 45:21.023
<i>the engineers have outfitted her</i>
<i>with defense systems for every situation.</i>

45:21.098 --> 45:25.558
- <i>And the 60 million kilowatt</i>
<i>internal nuclear power plant...</i>

45:25.636 --> 45:30.869
<i>guarantees she's always got enough juice</i>
<i>to get the tough jobs done.</i>

45:34.545 --> 45:37.673
- Ready to take her for a spin?
- Yes! My thoughts exactly.

45:37.748 --> 45:39.238
Whoa!

45:46.390 --> 45:48.984
Oh, the waiting is just mind-numbing.

45:49.060 --> 45:51.790
Well, I really need a Snicker's bar.
I don't know about you.

45:51.862 --> 45:54.763
I'm allergic to peanuts.

46:01.806 --> 46:04.434
Wow. This is even better
than circus peanuts.

46:04.508 --> 46:07.534
I still can't believe the grandson
of the great Ham is a clown.

46:07.611 --> 46:11.069
- <i>Hey, I like what I do.</i>
- Don't you wanna be a hero?

46:11.148 --> 46:14.208
You mean like a sandwich?

46:15.719 --> 46:18.347
I wish I could have welcomed you
with fruit from our village...

46:18.422 --> 46:20.947
but Zartog had it all destroyed.

46:22.493 --> 46:24.427
We're sorry, Kilowatt.

46:24.495 --> 46:26.963
Why would you build
a machine like that?

46:27.031 --> 46:29.693
- We didn't. The humans did.
- What are humans?

46:29.767 --> 46:33.328
<i>They're like us. Well, 99.9% like us.</i>

46:33.404 --> 46:35.998
But it's the.01
that makes them own everything.

46:36.073 --> 46:37.938
- Don't!
- But they're big gumdrops.

46:38.008 --> 46:41.842
That is not food.
That is a glophopper.

46:51.789 --> 46:56.624
Guys, is it just me, or is that
a really handsome pile of glophoppers?

46:58.596 --> 47:00.530
Hmm. Hey, check this out.

47:20.151 --> 47:23.143
Whoo!

47:23.220 --> 47:25.188
Why any life-form
would want to mimic you...

47:25.256 --> 47:28.020
is one of the unsolved mysteries
of the universe.

47:28.092 --> 47:31.584
- Come on. Bust out the scissors.
This rug ain't gonna cut itself.
- Ham.

47:31.662 --> 47:33.857
I've never danced before.

47:33.931 --> 47:35.899
Oh, okay.
So we'll take baby steps.

47:35.966 --> 47:39.026
Gimme your arm.

47:39.103 --> 47:43.062
There you go.
Not too shabby. You're a natural.

47:43.140 --> 47:45.938
I am? Really?

47:46.010 --> 47:48.171
Are you kiddin' me? Absolutely.

47:48.245 --> 47:50.873
Whee!

47:50.948 --> 47:53.416
I am poppin' as well as lockin'.

47:53.484 --> 47:59.252
Now the bus stop, robot, King Tut-
Rump dart.

47:59.323 --> 48:01.848
<i>Fluvians! Run for it.</i>

48:04.895 --> 48:06.760
<i>Ham, we can't outrun them!</i>

48:06.830 --> 48:10.425
Man, I love these dudes. Come on!

48:10.501 --> 48:13.561
They don't call me
the "Hamster" for nothing.

48:13.637 --> 48:17.198
You know, 'cause, like, my name is Ham
and I'm running in a wheel.

48:18.209 --> 48:22.646
- Never mind.
- Ah! Whoa! Ow! Ow! Ahh.

48:24.682 --> 48:27.446
<i>Get 'em!</i>

48:27.518 --> 48:31.386
Oh, no! Pull up! Pull up!

48:31.455 --> 48:33.389
<i>Yes!</i>

48:33.457 --> 48:36.392
<i> Whoa!</i>

48:36.460 --> 48:38.894
Ow!

48:38.963 --> 48:40.624
We really gotta work on stopping.

48:40.831 --> 48:45.461
No, no, wait. Don't leave, gumdrop people.
Your stopping skills are great!

48:45.536 --> 48:48.767
They are afraid. It is the Cave
of the Flesh-Devouring Beast.

48:51.342 --> 48:53.173
<i>What is with this planet?</i>

48:53.244 --> 48:55.838
Would it kill you to have
a Cave of Cute Little Kittens?

48:55.913 --> 48:58.313
Ham, we got to finish this mission.

48:58.382 --> 49:00.407
We only have 12 hours
till the ship takes off.

49:00.484 --> 49:03.578
Through the cave
is the only way to your ship.

49:03.654 --> 49:05.679
Run!

49:05.756 --> 49:09.522
Hurry, Luna!

49:15.399 --> 49:19.665
I want this party to be remembered forever.

49:19.737 --> 49:22.433
Beyond anything Malgor has ever seen.

49:22.506 --> 49:26.943
You'll need streamers.
Nothin' screams "festive" like streamers.

49:27.011 --> 49:31.141
I love 'em. Oh, and, uh, some, uh,
goody bags for when your guests leave.

49:31.215 --> 49:35.549
It's a fun, simple way to say,
"Thanks for comin'."

49:35.619 --> 49:38.019
<i>Splork, grab a pad.</i>

49:38.088 --> 49:40.454
- Uh-
- Maybe we'll get lucky...

49:40.524 --> 49:43.857
and this beast will only devour
our flesh with his eyes.

49:43.927 --> 49:45.952
Ham?

49:46.030 --> 49:48.055
Or not!

49:52.002 --> 49:54.994
Ooh! We have to find the exit.

49:55.072 --> 49:56.835
- Aah! Ham!
- Luna!

49:56.907 --> 49:58.875
Help! Aah!

49:58.942 --> 50:03.845
- This way! It's too narrow
for him to get through!

50:06.784 --> 50:09.912
- Help!
- Faster! It's gaining on us!

50:09.987 --> 50:11.887
Oh! Whoa!

50:13.023 --> 50:14.581
Dead end! Oh, no!

50:14.658 --> 50:16.387
Come on!

50:19.296 --> 50:20.888
- Aah!
- Whoa.

50:23.334 --> 50:25.393
- Kilowatt, turn yourself off!
- Cannot. Too scared.

50:25.469 --> 50:28.267
But if we can't get out of here, we're dead!

50:28.339 --> 50:31.035
- That is not helping.
- Okay, here's a trick.

50:31.108 --> 50:33.076
To control your fear,
imagine what you're most afraid of...

50:33.143 --> 50:35.077
and then imagine overcoming it.

50:39.616 --> 50:42.779
- Quick, Ham! It's breaking free!
- Come on. You can do it, Kilowatt.

50:43.921 --> 50:46.719
- <i> Be brave.</i>
- Okay. Control your fear.

50:46.790 --> 50:49.281
Control your fear.
Control your fear.

50:49.360 --> 50:51.294
Control your fear.
Control your fear.

50:51.362 --> 50:53.353
Control your fear.
Control your fear.

50:53.430 --> 50:54.795
<i>Control your fear.</i>

50:57.534 --> 51:00.628
Wow. It works.

51:00.704 --> 51:02.763
The exit!

51:06.543 --> 51:09.671
Let's go!

51:15.285 --> 51:18.448
- <i> It's blocking the way out.</i>
- We're trapped.

51:18.522 --> 51:23.459
I have been scared my entire life,
but you showed me how to control it.

51:23.527 --> 51:25.461
Kilowatt, no!
What are you doing?

51:25.529 --> 51:27.497
- What I must.
- Kilowatt.

51:38.242 --> 51:41.609
If you swallow me,
I will only grow stronger.

51:43.680 --> 51:47.081
- Kilowatt! No!
- Ham! Hurry.

51:47.151 --> 51:50.609
Why did she do that?

51:50.687 --> 51:53.383
Oh, so stupid... and brave.

51:53.457 --> 51:56.392
That was the bravest thing I've ever seen.

51:56.460 --> 51:59.054
- Whoa. Where are we?
- Whoa.

52:02.166 --> 52:04.396
<i>This must be the Dark Cloud of Id.</i>

52:05.669 --> 52:10.436
Oh, it's making me
feel weird... and depressed.

52:10.507 --> 52:15.035
I shouldn't even be here.
I'm just a low-rent circus chimp.

52:15.112 --> 52:18.479
- How does that make you feel?
- Like a stupid pet trick.

52:18.549 --> 52:20.608
Which is all I am- a joke!

52:20.684 --> 52:23.915
I could be replaced by a cannonball.

52:23.987 --> 52:28.617
Oh, man. Delirium, cryin', sobbin'.
They're runnin' out of oxygen!

52:28.692 --> 52:31.820
- Come on, sport. Gotta get through.
- I'm almost there.

52:33.397 --> 52:36.366
I'm not even a good chimp.
I've never once said thank you to Houston.

52:36.433 --> 52:39.891
- He's like a father to me.
- Oh, Ham.

52:39.970 --> 52:44.100
All my life I've been living
in my famous grandpa's shadow.

52:44.174 --> 52:47.075
How does that make you feel?

52:48.345 --> 52:50.905
You know what it's like
to live in a shadow?

52:50.981 --> 52:54.473
It's cold.
I knew I could never become a hero...

52:54.551 --> 52:58.043
so I became a clown.

52:58.121 --> 53:01.921
<i> I think you've had</i>
<i>a breakthrough. I'm afraid your time is up.</i>

53:04.962 --> 53:06.896
Here goes.

53:06.964 --> 53:09.023
With this much power,
they'll hear us for sure.

53:13.904 --> 53:16.668
<i> Oh, Lord.</i>

53:18.275 --> 53:23.235
- Ham-
- You know all that back there,
it was just the cloud talking. So-

53:23.313 --> 53:27.079
It's okay. Sometimes the conflict
between the superego and the id...

53:27.150 --> 53:30.517
can cast a long shadow in the soul.

53:30.587 --> 53:33.078
I have no idea what you just said.

53:33.156 --> 53:36.250
I'm gonna walk this way now.

53:37.728 --> 53:40.663
<i>Pathetic groveling slaves of Malgor...</i>

53:40.731 --> 53:44.690
welcome to Triple Sunday!

53:46.703 --> 53:50.867
Soon the suns will align
and the volcano will explode.

53:50.941 --> 53:54.570
And a lot of you are not going to live.

53:54.645 --> 53:57.205
Ahem! That's your cue.

53:59.316 --> 54:02.615
# Do you wanna rock
Do you wanna rock #

54:02.686 --> 54:05.712
# Do you wanna rock right now #

54:05.789 --> 54:09.281
Now we party my way.

54:09.359 --> 54:14.729
<i># Do you wanna rock</i>
<i>Do you wanna rock right now ## Yeah!</i>

54:14.798 --> 54:16.823
Dance or dunk.

54:20.571 --> 54:22.505
- You.
- Who?

54:22.573 --> 54:23.835
- <i>You're not dancing.</i>
- Yes, I am.

54:23.907 --> 54:26.637
- No, that's more of a shuffle.
- Nope, a dance.

54:26.710 --> 54:27.972
- Shuffle!
- Dance!

54:28.045 --> 54:30.809
Shuffle!

54:33.984 --> 54:36.452
- Shuffle.
- Okay. Shuffle.

54:36.520 --> 54:38.351
Whoa.

54:38.422 --> 54:41.721
That's like the second biggest
evil lair I've ever seen.

54:41.792 --> 54:43.919
And I've seen two.

54:43.994 --> 54:46.690
Hey, there's the ship.
And there's the rover!

54:46.763 --> 54:50.130
Now it is my thrill
to present the main attraction.

54:50.200 --> 54:53.101
<i>The monkey who showed me the way.</i>

54:53.170 --> 54:57.504
Here's Titan!

54:59.242 --> 55:02.370
- Oh, my gosh. Titan!
- Oh, my gosh. And he's not asleep.

55:02.446 --> 55:06.280
Oh, if we just had our rocket packs,
we could rescue Titan from the air.

55:08.352 --> 55:11.685
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Uh, we're not paid to think.

55:11.755 --> 55:14.383
As a matter of fact, we're not paid at all.
Think about <i>that!</i>

55:14.458 --> 55:17.359
Uh, wait.
Chimps don't leave chimps behind.

55:17.427 --> 55:19.361
Luna.

55:19.429 --> 55:21.590
I hear ya. I hear ya. I do.

55:21.665 --> 55:23.826
But here's what I have to say about it.

55:23.900 --> 55:26.061
Let's leave him.

55:26.136 --> 55:29.037
- Ham.
- Fine. We'll save him.

55:29.106 --> 55:32.701
Begin torturously slow dunking mechanism.

55:32.776 --> 55:37.076
Uh, "Zartig," now that I've gotten to know you,
you seem like a reasonable alien...

55:37.147 --> 55:40.810
which is why I'm willing
to offer you a plea bargain.

55:40.884 --> 55:42.351
No.

55:42.419 --> 55:43.818
- Let's go.
- Whoa.

55:46.923 --> 55:48.857
Here we go, ladies.

55:48.925 --> 55:54.420
Sure, go ahead. Dunk me. Now you'll
never learn how to use the 3-D radar.

55:54.498 --> 55:59.697
- Huh? 3-D radar?
- Yeah, oh. Whoa! That's right. 3-D radar.

55:59.770 --> 56:02.364
- Luna, follow me.
- Roger that.

56:02.439 --> 56:05.033
Who's Roger? Is it serious?

56:05.108 --> 56:07.872
Tell me, tell me, tell me, please.

56:07.944 --> 56:12.404
Flip the bar with the star.

56:12.482 --> 56:15.918
<i>Not too far to start the radar.</i>

56:17.287 --> 56:19.255
You take the left. I'll take the right.

56:19.322 --> 56:22.120
Alert. Chimpanzees incoming.

56:22.192 --> 56:25.423
- What?
- Yee-hoo!

56:25.495 --> 56:28.020
Fire away!

56:35.872 --> 56:38.306
Luna! Nice.

56:38.375 --> 56:40.775
Now let's get back to the ship...

56:40.844 --> 56:44.746
- so I can save you guys and pilot us home.
- Whoo-hoo!

56:49.653 --> 56:53.612
- Where did those chimps go?
- They escaped!

56:53.690 --> 56:56.921
Traitor.

57:01.631 --> 57:04.464
<i> Commander,</i>
<i>launch control is unresponsive.</i>

57:04.534 --> 57:05.899
Check diagnostics.

57:05.969 --> 57:10.770
- Huh?
- Nothing but bells and whistles.

57:10.841 --> 57:14.504
But why did they teach us all that stuff
if the controls weren't even hooked up?

57:14.578 --> 57:17.138
I told you guys.
This whole thing was a sham.

57:17.214 --> 57:20.342
They wanted to see if our brains still worked
after going through a wormhole.

57:20.417 --> 57:24.285
- We're Spam in a can.
- And we weren't even supposed to open the can.

57:24.354 --> 57:26.481
Sorry, Luna, but we're
nothin' more than guinea pigs.

57:26.556 --> 57:29.582
Actually, the guinea pigs
are on the Mars mission.

57:29.659 --> 57:32.025
Whee!

57:32.095 --> 57:34.791
The ship was on autopilot
the whole time.

57:34.865 --> 57:38.562
We were never really flying it.
We were never really astronauts.

57:38.635 --> 57:41.763
- You were right all along.
- I didn't want to be right.

57:41.838 --> 57:44.466
Besides, that's what humans think of us,
not what we should think.

57:47.277 --> 57:50.678
Why wasn't I born a rabbit or a squirrel
or an art history major?

57:50.747 --> 57:53.113
Nobody expects great things from them.

57:53.183 --> 57:56.118
<i>Three minutes to liftoff.</i>

57:56.186 --> 57:59.053
<i>Well, at least we're safe and goin' home.</i>

57:59.122 --> 58:00.783
1,600 crunches a day...

58:01.024 --> 58:03.857
<i>500 push-ups with each arm-</i>

58:03.927 --> 58:07.192
<i>All that training for what?</i>

58:13.870 --> 58:15.861
I can't go.

58:15.939 --> 58:17.736
- What?
- <i>I know we didn't build the probe.</i>

58:17.808 --> 58:20.368
But it came from Earth.
We did this to them.

58:20.443 --> 58:23.503
I can't run away.
We owe it to Kilowatt and this planet.

58:23.580 --> 58:26.913
I took an oath to return this ship to Earth,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

58:31.755 --> 58:34.656
- Ham's right.
- Huh?
- Huh?

58:34.724 --> 58:38.353
I'd rather be a hero here on Malgor
than a space chump back on Earth.

58:38.428 --> 58:41.158
Lieutenant Luna. This is an order.

58:48.605 --> 58:51.540
- There goes our ride.
- And Titan.

58:51.608 --> 58:53.838
Commander!

58:53.910 --> 58:57.437
- What about your oath?
- Chimps don't leave chimps behind.

58:57.514 --> 58:59.880
You, sir, are gonna make me cry.

58:59.950 --> 59:01.884
Ham, we need a plan.

59:01.952 --> 59:05.319
The commander of the mission
comes up with the plan.

59:05.388 --> 59:07.515
And your plan is?

59:07.591 --> 59:10.025
Well, the plan.
Yes, the plan, of course.

59:10.093 --> 59:14.257
Since I'm the commander of the plan,
whatever plan is my plan.

59:14.331 --> 59:16.629
It's not your plan. It's not Ham's-

59:16.700 --> 59:17.826
- <i> Titan!</i>
- Whoa! Whoa!

59:17.901 --> 59:19.562
It's party time.

59:28.044 --> 59:31.411
We have contact.
The ship has exited the wormhole.

59:31.481 --> 59:33.472
Touchdown in 15 seconds.

59:33.550 --> 59:37.452
Okay, here we go. History in the making, boys.
Roll those cameras.

59:43.360 --> 59:45.590
What the-

01:00:00.343 --> 01:00:04.302
- Whoa.
- Oh, no.

01:00:04.381 --> 01:00:07.612
I'm afraid the chimpanzees
did not make it.

01:00:07.684 --> 01:00:09.618
You think?

01:00:09.686 --> 01:00:12.450
That's it. Mission canceled.
Space program's done.

01:00:13.757 --> 01:00:15.486
Oh, no.
They're gonna be stuck up there.

01:00:15.558 --> 01:00:19.927
As of tomorrow, this entire agency will be
recommissioned into something useful...

01:00:19.996 --> 01:00:24.433
like one of those places where you design
and paint and bake your own plates!

01:00:25.502 --> 01:00:27.436
He does have a point.
That is useful.

01:00:27.504 --> 01:00:29.199
What about the two chimps still here?

01:00:29.272 --> 01:00:32.833
Two chimps, two words.
"Animal testing."

01:00:32.909 --> 01:00:36.037
- We have to get to mission control.
- We're their only chance.

01:00:37.547 --> 01:00:39.606
Follow me.

01:00:39.683 --> 01:00:42.846
- Hold on.
- <i>Cool.</i>

01:00:42.919 --> 01:00:46.355
For a 20th-century chimp, you're moving
pretty quickly into the 21 st century.

01:00:49.259 --> 01:00:51.193
Yee-haw!

01:00:52.262 --> 01:00:54.287
Whoa.

01:00:56.099 --> 01:00:58.624
I may be old, but I'm aerodynamic.

01:00:58.702 --> 01:01:00.693
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoa.

01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:03.398
You're gonna have to keep up, son.
Whoo-hoo.

01:01:12.949 --> 01:01:17.181
- Great plan.
- <i> At last. Prepare to be dunked!</i>

01:01:17.253 --> 01:01:19.483
- Lieutenant Luna.
- Yes, Commander?

01:01:19.556 --> 01:01:21.649
You should have asked Ham
to come up with the plan.

01:01:21.725 --> 01:01:26.094
<i>Three chimps, three coats. Which one first?</i>

01:01:26.162 --> 01:01:27.925
Is it you?

01:01:28.932 --> 01:01:30.160
- <i>The big one?</i>
- What?

01:01:30.233 --> 01:01:33.361
Or will it be you, the adorable one?

01:01:33.436 --> 01:01:36.894
Or all three at once?

01:01:36.973 --> 01:01:39.498
Well, as commander,
the least I can do is make sure...

01:01:39.576 --> 01:01:42.136
"Zelbaum" here doesn't dunk you guys.

01:01:42.212 --> 01:01:46.012
How would you do that?

01:01:46.082 --> 01:01:50.849
Because I will teach you the rover's
secret to universal domination.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.856
- Huh?
- The entire universe? That's big, right?

01:01:54.924 --> 01:01:57.552
- But first, let my crew go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

01:01:57.627 --> 01:01:59.356
Tell me.

01:01:59.429 --> 01:02:00.691
- No, don't.
- Titan, don't!

01:02:00.764 --> 01:02:02.755
- Tell me, tell me, please.
- What's he doing?

01:02:02.832 --> 01:02:05.232
<i>Please tell me. Tell it to me.</i>
<i>Tell me please. I'll let you live.</i>

01:02:05.301 --> 01:02:09.465
So, to dominate the universe,
hit the yellow button first.

01:02:09.539 --> 01:02:12.804
<i>Turn the blue knob</i>
<i>and then the green.</i>

01:02:13.843 --> 01:02:17.370
<i>Then pull the lever in reverse.</i>

01:02:17.447 --> 01:02:19.813
- Oh, this one?
- That's right.

01:02:22.452 --> 01:02:23.976
Wait.

01:02:24.054 --> 01:02:28.252
- <i>Wow. You really are stupid.</i>
- Yeah.

01:02:28.324 --> 01:02:29.757
And a really bad poet.

01:02:35.398 --> 01:02:38.561
Oops. Did I say "reverse?"

01:02:38.635 --> 01:02:40.466
Crudlar.

01:02:40.537 --> 01:02:42.664
<i>That was a joke.</i>

01:02:42.739 --> 01:02:44.229
<i>Traitor!</i>

01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:50.109
Whoo!

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:51.169
- Huh?
- Huh?

01:02:51.247 --> 01:02:53.272
Wowzers.

01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:55.283
- Kilowatt! But how?
- Kilowatt, you're alive.

01:02:55.351 --> 01:02:57.615
We saw the Flesh-Devouring Beast
swallow you.

01:02:57.687 --> 01:03:01.453
He-He's not big on chewing.

01:03:01.524 --> 01:03:03.822
- But how did you get out?
- Um-

01:03:07.864 --> 01:03:10.162
Don't make me go there.

01:03:10.233 --> 01:03:12.292
- Ew.
- What?

01:03:12.368 --> 01:03:14.359
You guys need a hand?

01:03:16.906 --> 01:03:18.806
<i>Does anybody want the "Zelik"statue?</i>

01:03:18.875 --> 01:03:20.809
<i>'Cause I'll take it.</i>

01:03:26.116 --> 01:03:29.108
You have liberated us
from the bonds of slavery.

01:03:29.185 --> 01:03:32.951
We are eternally grateful.
We owe you our lives.

01:03:33.022 --> 01:03:34.819
- We came.
- We crashed.

01:03:34.891 --> 01:03:36.688
W-We kicked his butt!

01:03:38.328 --> 01:03:41.354
What? Why'd you have to
bring his butt into it?

01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:44.867
- It's a sayin'. That's how it goes.
- No, that is not how it goes.

01:03:44.934 --> 01:03:48.563
I'm, like, 99% sure that's how it goes.

01:03:48.638 --> 01:03:51.732
You Earthlings have
a funny way of showing love.

01:03:51.808 --> 01:03:53.799
Luna? Do you read me?

01:03:53.877 --> 01:03:55.902
Hey, Luna,
is that a banana in your pocket?

01:03:55.979 --> 01:03:58.140
Would you evolve?

01:03:58.214 --> 01:04:00.011
- Sorry.
- Comet to Luna.

01:04:00.083 --> 01:04:01.141
- Comet?
- Luna.

01:04:01.217 --> 01:04:03.208
Comet. Oh, thank heavens.

01:04:03.286 --> 01:04:05.982
- You'll never believe what's happening.
- We've heard everything.

01:04:06.055 --> 01:04:08.990
- We've been able to hear you the whole time.
- The whole time?

01:04:09.058 --> 01:04:11.583
Yep. The whole time, son.

01:04:11.661 --> 01:04:14.459
I'm sorry I kept pushin' you
to live up to your legacy.

01:04:14.531 --> 01:04:17.557
It's okay, Houston.
Maybe it's time I do.

01:04:17.634 --> 01:04:19.761
- What's your status?
- Single.

01:04:19.836 --> 01:04:22.566
- But there's someone I've got my eye on.
- Oh.

01:04:22.639 --> 01:04:25.107
It's Luna,
in case you were wondering.

01:04:25.175 --> 01:04:27.200
Oh, wait. Are we talking about
the mission status here?

01:04:27.277 --> 01:04:28.835
<i> Yeah.</i>

01:04:28.912 --> 01:04:31.403
Ah, well, everything's okay,
but we have no way to leave.

01:04:31.481 --> 01:04:35.941
- You still got the probe.
- The probe? It wasn't designed
to return to Earth.

01:04:36.019 --> 01:04:37.577
We'll just have to "chimprovise."

01:04:37.654 --> 01:04:39.679
You know,
I kinda missed your stupid puns.

01:04:39.756 --> 01:04:41.690
- Thank you.
- <i> Titan's right.</i>

01:04:41.758 --> 01:04:44.249
- You'll need a complete redesign.
- How do we do that?

01:04:44.327 --> 01:04:46.625
Uh, let me put you on with Comet.

01:04:46.696 --> 01:04:50.223
First, we'll need to re-engineer
the aerodynamic skeletal structure.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:53.201
- Got it. Let me put ya on with Luna.
- Go ahead, Comet.

01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:55.794
- Second, you'll need thrust.
- Huh.

01:04:55.872 --> 01:04:58.136
We'd need at least
7.7 million pounds of thrust...

01:04:58.208 --> 01:05:00.676
to reach the velocity
to escape the planet's gravity.

01:05:00.743 --> 01:05:05.077
<i>We'd never get that kind of thrust without</i>
<i>a two-stage rocket. It can't be done.</i>

01:05:05.148 --> 01:05:09.278
Even if we could build a ship,
it'd never get off this planet.

01:05:10.853 --> 01:05:12.411
Ham?

01:05:13.723 --> 01:05:15.884
If you can shoot
a chimp out of a cannon...

01:05:15.959 --> 01:05:18.223
<i>you can shoot a ship out of a volcano.</i>

01:05:18.294 --> 01:05:21.695
Of course! Geothermal energy.

01:05:21.764 --> 01:05:23.755
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

01:05:23.833 --> 01:05:26.393
Kilowatt, we're gonna need some help
if we're ever gonna get home.

01:05:26.469 --> 01:05:28.403
Planet Malgor at your service.

01:05:28.471 --> 01:05:31.338
Let's chimp this ride.

01:05:31.407 --> 01:05:35.173
I know I said I missed the puns,
but that was just unacceptable.

01:05:40.717 --> 01:05:43.117
Standing by. Awaiting instructions.

01:05:43.186 --> 01:05:44.778
I need duct tape, and I need it now.

01:05:44.854 --> 01:05:47.914
Yeah, over there. Right. That's good.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.687
We have to move fast.

01:05:56.232 --> 01:05:59.429
Load up those pipes!
Seal 'em up, fellas!

01:06:45.048 --> 01:06:48.040
Kilowatt, we'll never forget you.

01:06:48.117 --> 01:06:50.813
<i>Aw, I won't either.</i>

01:06:50.887 --> 01:06:53.412
<i> Well, she won't win</i>
<i>any beauty contests, but she'll fly.</i>

01:06:53.489 --> 01:06:55.013
- <i> Probably.</i>
- <i> Maybe.</i>

01:06:55.091 --> 01:06:56.888
<i>Hopefully.</i>

01:06:56.959 --> 01:06:59.519
Eh, let's not over analyze it.

01:06:59.595 --> 01:07:01.586
<i>The suns are aligning. You must hurry.</i>

01:07:01.664 --> 01:07:03.097
The volcano is about to erupt.

01:07:03.166 --> 01:07:05.760
Oh, no. What about reentry?

01:07:05.835 --> 01:07:08.235
- <i>You're going to need a nose cone.</i>
- Nose cone?

01:07:08.304 --> 01:07:10.864
- Huh?
- No time. How are we gonna build a nose cone?

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:13.500
Uh, hello?

01:07:16.913 --> 01:07:19.313
<i> Mission control,</i>
Infinity <i>is in the launch chute.</i>

01:07:19.382 --> 01:07:21.009
- <i> Five seconds.</i>
- I can't look.

01:07:21.084 --> 01:07:24.076
- It's louder than a cannon!
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:07:34.297 --> 01:07:36.458
- Ooh!
- Ahh! Whoo-hoo!

01:07:59.822 --> 01:08:02.791
Whoo! We did it!
We-We-We-We stopped the Freznar!

01:08:02.859 --> 01:08:05.123
We're saved!

01:08:06.896 --> 01:08:09.660
Time to go home.

01:08:09.732 --> 01:08:12.929
Bye. Bye. Bye.

01:08:18.774 --> 01:08:21.505
<i>I can see the headlines now.</i>

01:08:21.577 --> 01:08:23.841
"Commander Titan returns to Earth."

01:08:23.912 --> 01:08:27.508
What will I wear?
I mean, what goes with ticker tape?

01:08:30.486 --> 01:08:32.420
Approaching wormhole threshold.

01:08:32.488 --> 01:08:34.080
- Here it comes. Take this.
- Huh?

01:08:34.157 --> 01:08:38.116
- But I don't know how.
- When we pass out, you've gotta pilot us home.

01:08:38.194 --> 01:08:40.094
What are you, nuts?
I'm not an astronaut.

01:08:40.162 --> 01:08:42.825
- Are you wearing aluminum clothes?
- Um, yeah.

01:08:42.899 --> 01:08:44.696
- Are you in a rocket?
- Yeah.

01:08:44.767 --> 01:08:46.428
- In outer space?
- Yeah.

01:08:46.502 --> 01:08:49.528
- Are you David Bowie?
- No.

01:08:49.604 --> 01:08:54.042
Then you must be an astronaut.
Bring this bird home, hotshot!

01:08:58.113 --> 01:08:58.944
Whoa!

01:09:02.685 --> 01:09:04.175
I'm not cut out for this.

01:09:04.252 --> 01:09:05.880
- Ham?
- Luna.

01:09:05.955 --> 01:09:08.617
I believe in you.

01:09:08.691 --> 01:09:11.921
Wait. Luna, no. Titan.

01:09:11.993 --> 01:09:14.154
Titan? Whoa!

01:09:16.799 --> 01:09:18.130
<i>You keep showboatin'-</i>

01:09:18.201 --> 01:09:19.862
<i>You're not in the circus anymore.</i>

01:09:19.935 --> 01:09:22.529
<i> Ham the Third!</i>

01:09:22.604 --> 01:09:25.005
<i> Your insubordinate behavior</i>
<i>will get you chimp-martialed!</i>

01:09:25.073 --> 01:09:26.473
<i>When will you straighten up and fly right?</i>

01:09:26.542 --> 01:09:29.102
<i> You're a threat</i>
<i>to the mission, cannonball!</i>

01:09:34.484 --> 01:09:37.078
<i>Believe in yourself, Ham.</i>

01:09:37.153 --> 01:09:41.145
Grandpa Ham?
I can't do this. I'm not you.

01:09:41.224 --> 01:09:43.419
<i>Well, of course you're not me.</i>
<i>You're you.</i>

01:09:43.493 --> 01:09:45.586
<i>You can do things, son.</i>

01:09:45.661 --> 01:09:48.858
<i>Just do them your way.</i>

01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:50.865
Whoa.

01:09:55.505 --> 01:09:57.530
That's them.
They're out of the wormhole.

01:09:57.607 --> 01:10:01.668
<i>Infinity,</i> welcome back.
Ham, do you read me?

01:10:01.744 --> 01:10:03.712
Shh. The kids are sleeping.

01:10:03.779 --> 01:10:06.577
<i> Ham, you have to</i>
<i>align your ship for reentry.</i>

01:10:06.649 --> 01:10:10.881
You're coming in too hot. You've gotta reduce
your angle for reentry by 33 degrees-

01:10:10.953 --> 01:10:15.788
- Exactly 33 degrees.
- Uh, kind of exactly or exactly-exactly?

01:10:15.858 --> 01:10:17.792
Exactly-exactly.

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:20.590
If you don't nail that reentry window,
you'll be space dust.

01:10:20.663 --> 01:10:23.188
- Great.
- <i>Now, engage ailerons.</i>

01:10:23.266 --> 01:10:25.234
- Check.
- <i>Flick the turbulence coolers on.</i>

01:10:25.301 --> 01:10:27.064
- Uh, check.
- <i>Adjust the heat deflectors.</i>

01:10:27.136 --> 01:10:29.570
<i>And enable gyroscopic stabilizers.</i>

01:10:29.639 --> 01:10:32.301
Uh-oh. Help!

01:10:32.375 --> 01:10:34.536
I can't reach it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:37.773
- Ham, you're pitching up.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:10:40.016 --> 01:10:43.213
- <i>Holy out of "controlly!"</i>
- <i> Hey, need a copilot?</i>

01:10:43.286 --> 01:10:45.220
Lieutenant Luna. Sure, I do.

01:10:47.623 --> 01:10:51.389
Mission Control,
adjusting our angle to 33 degrees.

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.325
- Yes!
- Oh, mercy.

01:10:56.966 --> 01:10:59.161
<i>We did it! Florida, we have visuals.</i>

01:10:59.235 --> 01:11:01.430
What about Commander Coma?
Should we wake him up?

01:11:01.504 --> 01:11:04.996
- We don't need a third wheel on our date.
- Luna, ooh.

01:11:05.074 --> 01:11:07.565
- Lower the landing gear.
- Check.

01:11:07.643 --> 01:11:11.443
<i>Uh, Houston,</i>
<i>our landing gear is toast.</i>

01:11:11.514 --> 01:11:15.006
Oh, boy. I picked a bad week
to quit eating bananas.

01:11:15.084 --> 01:11:17.109
- What now?
- Don't worry, son.

01:11:17.186 --> 01:11:20.280
Low-tech solutions are my specialty.

01:11:20.356 --> 01:11:22.290
- <i>Ham, remember the circus?</i>
- Yeah.

01:11:22.358 --> 01:11:24.918
- <i>Good. You're gonna crash.</i>
- We're gonna crash?

01:11:24.994 --> 01:11:27.121
But this time, stay on target.

01:11:27.196 --> 01:11:30.962
- Roger that, Houston.
- Oh, why are you smiling if we're gonna crash?

01:11:31.033 --> 01:11:36.096
Because crashing is what I do best.
Yee-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:40.832
Come out with your paws up.

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:44.402
Paws? They're chimps. Th-They have hands,
with opposable thumbs.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.075
- Come out with your thumbs up.
- And they don't understand English.

01:11:52.188 --> 01:11:55.123
Kick it down.

01:11:55.191 --> 01:11:57.386
Yahoo!

01:11:58.194 --> 01:12:01.095
Wait, my rug.

01:12:01.163 --> 01:12:04.564
We all knew. Everybody knew.

01:12:04.634 --> 01:12:08.661
Everyone knew when you wouldn't
go swimming at the office party.

01:12:12.341 --> 01:12:13.774
Here we go!

01:12:19.415 --> 01:12:21.406
- Oh!
- What was that?

01:12:23.919 --> 01:12:27.013
I can't hold it!
We lost steering control!

01:12:27.089 --> 01:12:29.353
Uh, Ham!

01:12:32.294 --> 01:12:33.989
Whoo-hoo! Clutch.

01:12:34.063 --> 01:12:37.863
I said "clutch!"

01:12:37.933 --> 01:12:40.868
You got it.

01:12:41.837 --> 01:12:44.635
Oh, Lord.

01:12:46.175 --> 01:12:49.611
I never thought I'd be saying this,
but you gotta crash this ship.

01:12:49.679 --> 01:12:52.739
What are you doing?
No, Luna, don't.

01:12:52.815 --> 01:12:54.749
I'll see you on the ground.

01:12:56.786 --> 01:12:59.346
While we close the chapter
on space travel...

01:12:59.422 --> 01:13:04.917
we open an amazing new chapter
in "paint your own plate" history.

01:13:12.001 --> 01:13:14.595
Whoa! Just a little bit farther.

01:13:21.811 --> 01:13:24.780
Luna, you did it! I got control!

01:13:24.847 --> 01:13:27.475
Yes!

01:13:29.118 --> 01:13:32.019
The national space program
is hereby offic-

01:13:32.088 --> 01:13:33.419
Oh!

01:13:34.657 --> 01:13:37.490
Whoa!

01:13:43.799 --> 01:13:45.994
No!

01:13:46.068 --> 01:13:47.763
Luna!

01:13:54.477 --> 01:13:56.638
<i>Whoa!</i>

01:13:56.712 --> 01:13:58.646
- Oh, man.
- Whoa!

01:14:06.255 --> 01:14:07.813
Whoa!

01:14:19.568 --> 01:14:23.766
Luna! Luna! Luna, get up!

01:14:24.974 --> 01:14:26.908
You're okay, right?

01:14:26.976 --> 01:14:31.709
Oh, this can't be happening.
Come on, Luna.

01:14:32.782 --> 01:14:35.751
I stayed on target this time.

01:14:35.818 --> 01:14:37.979
I was tryin' to be more like you.

01:14:38.988 --> 01:14:41.889
- You were always-
- Right.

01:14:41.957 --> 01:14:44.016
- Yeah, and you made me-
- Better?

01:14:44.093 --> 01:14:47.028
Yeah. And-
And if I had to be without you-

01:14:47.096 --> 01:14:49.030
- You won't be.
- Luna!

01:14:49.098 --> 01:14:50.656
Ham.

01:14:52.201 --> 01:14:55.967
- But how'd you survive?
- Chin down, opposable thumbs in.

01:14:56.038 --> 01:14:59.201
Lieutenant Luna, you crash with style.

01:14:59.275 --> 01:15:02.608
<i>Cannonball, I was wrong about you.</i>

01:15:02.678 --> 01:15:04.543
You would've made
your grandfather proud.

01:15:04.613 --> 01:15:08.242
Thanks. I guess I'm just
a chimp off the old block.

01:15:08.317 --> 01:15:11.480
That's a good one.
I'll have to use that line.

01:15:13.556 --> 01:15:16.582
Way to stick the landin', hotshot.
I always knew you had it in ya.

01:15:16.659 --> 01:15:18.991
What can I say?
I'm an envelope pusher.

01:15:19.061 --> 01:15:22.030
<i>Hey, Ham.</i>
<i>Official space commander shades.</i>

01:15:22.097 --> 01:15:26.466
Here's your Bananaberry back.
It was almost as good as havin' you with us.

01:15:30.739 --> 01:15:32.866
The <i>Infinity?</i>

01:15:32.942 --> 01:15:35.001
- But how?
- Impossible.

01:15:35.077 --> 01:15:37.272
This ship was not designed to return.

01:15:37.346 --> 01:15:39.371
- It isn't even a ship.
- It is a miracle.

01:15:39.448 --> 01:15:41.882
A major scientific achievement!

01:15:41.951 --> 01:15:44.511
But who built it?

01:16:01.003 --> 01:16:04.268
I think we might wanna retest
our space chimps' I.Q.'s.

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:06.501
Are you implying
the chimps built this ship?

01:16:06.575 --> 01:16:10.238
We may never know who built it,
but they brought it home.

01:16:10.312 --> 01:16:14.248
- Senator!
- Senator, were you wrong to
shut down the space agency?

01:16:16.919 --> 01:16:21.015
I-Well, I-

01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:24.924
I'd like to announce
the opening of a high-tech facility...

01:16:24.994 --> 01:16:27.827
devoted to the exploration
of deepest space.

01:16:27.897 --> 01:16:31.697
With first-class facilities for the chimps...

01:16:31.767 --> 01:16:36.761
and with a make-your-own sundae bar.

01:16:36.839 --> 01:16:41.503
- Personalized-
- And personalized pocket protectors
for everyone!

01:16:45.681 --> 01:16:47.171
- Excuse me? Excuse me?
- Excuse me?

01:16:47.249 --> 01:16:49.581
- Can I-
- Excuse me, over here!

01:16:49.652 --> 01:16:52.314
Pardon me! Pardon me!
Did the chimps encounter alien life?

01:16:55.357 --> 01:16:59.191
We will have to launch another mission
to ever know for sure.

01:16:59.261 --> 01:17:01.195
- Ready, Luna?
- <i>Ready, Captain.</i>

01:17:01.263 --> 01:17:03.788
- Big fella?
- Born ready, cannonball.

01:17:03.866 --> 01:17:06.664
Streamers!

01:17:06.735 --> 01:17:10.694
- I love 'em!
- <i> # Every one is addressed to me #</i>

01:17:10.773 --> 01:17:13.901

01:18:08.263 --> 01:18:11.096
