WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:04.471
WADE: That's why you stopped
 our little frolic

00:04.471 --> 00:05.739
the other night?
You got googly eyes

00:05.739 --> 00:07.075
for golden boy George?

00:07.075 --> 00:08.642
LEMON: Zoe Hart has flipped
 some New York

00:08.642 --> 00:11.345
switch in you, and you are just
not the same person anymore.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.581
LAVON: We are
 at your engagement party.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.749
You know how difficult
this is for me.
Difficult never stopped me.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.818
LEMON: This needs to stop.
 I can't handle it.

00:17.818 --> 00:18.886
What do you want
from me here?

00:18.886 --> 00:19.820
I'm trying to move on,

00:19.820 --> 00:21.455
and you won't let me.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.691
Didi found this hidden
under your desk.
You've got

00:23.691 --> 00:24.358
to keep this secret.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.426
Do you still love her?

00:25.426 --> 00:26.860
Sometimes I think I might.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.363
Maybe George and Lemon
will live happily ever after.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.165
All I know is,
it's not my place to tell him.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.673
(hooting)

01:01.329 --> 01:03.397
People, it's here!

01:03.397 --> 01:04.998
The MOTY! It's the MOTY!

01:04.998 --> 01:07.067
It's the MOTY!
It's the MOTY.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.736
So, you dragged me here.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.239
Now, can you tell me
what this MOTY is

01:11.239 --> 01:13.407
that everyone is
so excited about?
Yeah.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.343
Is it a car? 'Cause
my ex-boyfriend used

01:15.343 --> 01:17.077
to always take me
to see cars.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.212
(sighs)

01:18.212 --> 01:20.881
MOTY. M-O-T-Y.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.883
Uh-huh.
(exclaims)

01:22.883 --> 01:23.951
Ah!

01:23.951 --> 01:25.319
(laughs)

01:25.319 --> 01:27.888
The award is given every
year by the BlueBell Owls.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.958
That's our men's club,
like the Elks or the Lions.

01:30.958 --> 01:35.095
Okay, and "whoooo" is in it?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.064
I'm not talking to you.
Oh, come on.

01:37.064 --> 01:39.267
All right, I'm sorry.
Please tell me about the MOTY.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.101
It's actually a very big honor.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.903
Let me guess.
There's a big town event.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.905
No, Dr. Sarcastic.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.039
There are two.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.441
Tonight, Mayor
Lavon Hayes

01:47.441 --> 01:49.042
will host an intimate
cocktail party

01:49.042 --> 01:50.978
for the winner,
his family and the Owls.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.313
Tomorrow's a big gala event

01:52.313 --> 01:54.047
at the old
Cotton Exchange building.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.383
You know

01:55.383 --> 01:57.050
your father, Harley--
God rest his soul--

01:57.050 --> 01:58.519
he won ten years in a row.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.655
Wait. I'm assuming
that it's your turn this year?

02:01.655 --> 02:04.592
This year's winner
remains a mystery,

02:04.592 --> 02:06.994
though doctors--

02:06.994 --> 02:08.362
they do have a leg up

02:08.362 --> 02:11.199
in the whole benefitting
humanity thing.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.334
The MOTY!

02:13.334 --> 02:15.536
You must be so nervous!

02:15.536 --> 02:17.205
I couldn't take
the suspense.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.940
I can't watch a season finale
of America's Next Top model

02:19.940 --> 02:21.175
without my throat
closing up.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.311
Well, you ought
to come see me about that.

02:23.311 --> 02:25.045
Yeah?
Yeah. Now,
if you'll excuse me?

02:25.045 --> 02:26.314
I mean, what if one
day, you decide

02:26.314 --> 02:27.848
If you'll excuse me.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.483
MAN:
Hear ye. Hear ye.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.784
Gather round, everybody.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.220
Let's all gather.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.755
Now, the Man of the Year
must be a role model.

02:34.755 --> 02:38.626
A man who has dedicated
his entire life and career

02:38.626 --> 02:40.661
to helping the
people of BlueBell.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.330
So, please join me

02:42.330 --> 02:43.597
and my fellow members

02:43.597 --> 02:46.900
of BlueBell
Fraternal Order of the Owls...

02:46.900 --> 02:48.035
(hooting)

02:48.035 --> 02:51.104
...in celebrating
the MOTY.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.406
Ah.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.843
Mr. George Tucker!

02:55.843 --> 02:57.978
(applause and hooting)

02:57.978 --> 02:58.979
Yeah!

02:58.979 --> 03:01.815
(hooting)

03:01.815 --> 03:04.685
(chuckles)

03:04.685 --> 03:05.386
Congratulations.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.654
Thank you so much.

03:06.654 --> 03:07.521
Mm-hmm.
It's an honor.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.657
Congratulations, George.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.792
Oh, thank you,
Brick. I...
George.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.327
Oh.
Congratulations.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.395
You okay, Daddy?

03:14.395 --> 03:15.963
Yeah. No, I'm great.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.499
Listen, I couldn't be more proud
of my future son-in-law.

03:18.499 --> 03:22.002
I'm so... proud.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.804
(sighs)

03:23.804 --> 03:26.374
Is he, uh...?
Oh, he's fine.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.008
Okay?
He's fine,

03:28.008 --> 03:29.410
and you deserve it!

03:29.410 --> 03:32.680
Wow. It does mean a lot.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.548
'Cause I remember being here

03:34.548 --> 03:37.217
15 years ago when my
dad won, and I just...

03:37.217 --> 03:39.086
never thought I'd
be on that list.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.721
(laughs)
Bet he'd be proud.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.222
Well, I'm sure he would be.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.424
(laughs)

03:43.424 --> 03:45.293
You think maybe
I should call 'em,

03:45.293 --> 03:47.561
see if they want to
come to the ceremony?

03:47.561 --> 03:49.430
(laughs)
It's just, you know,

03:49.430 --> 03:51.565
remember what they did
to you at Planksgiving?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.767
Baby, I know, but they're...
they're still my parents.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.503
I'm just thinking of you, okay?

03:55.503 --> 03:56.970
Because every time
that they come to town,

03:56.970 --> 03:58.906
it's always about them,
and you end up getting hurt,

03:58.906 --> 04:01.108
and I'm sorry,
but I don't like it.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.943
Okay, okay.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.312
You're right.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.446
Okay?

04:05.446 --> 04:07.047
All right.
All right.

04:07.047 --> 04:07.915
(laughs)

04:07.915 --> 04:09.717
George Tucker.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.085
I did not see that one coming.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.554
Oh, man.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.123
Now you have to throw
a cocktail party

04:16.123 --> 04:17.558
in his honor tonight?

04:17.558 --> 04:19.726
If you hear a scream
from my place later,

04:19.726 --> 04:21.962
it's just me lifting weights.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.964
That's all.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.943
Oh. Hey, Magnolia.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.745
Nice helmet.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.848
Hey, Wade.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.116
Um, I was just
taking a shortcut

04:43.116 --> 04:44.952
from the Rammer Jammer.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.220
Okay.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.923
Uh, you missed the
big MOTY announcement.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.091
Oh, yeah.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.493
Take it I won?

04:52.493 --> 04:54.895
(laughs)
You're funny.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.029
(laughing)

04:56.029 --> 04:59.900
Um, okay, I'll-I'll
talk to you later.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.902
Okay.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.304
Ride safe.

05:14.782 --> 05:18.452
Well, there he is,
the MOTY himself.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.920
I'm new here,
so, I don't know.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.155
Am I supposed to curtsy, or
is kissing your hand enough?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.524
It's not like that at all.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.859
You just got to make sure
you call me Your Majesty

05:25.859 --> 05:27.361
and don't make
direct eye contact.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.830
(laughs)
What are you doing
at City Hall?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.799
Um, well,

05:31.799 --> 05:35.369
I have decided
to change my name.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.004
Really?
Yeah.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.840
Turns out that my dad
moved back to New York

05:39.840 --> 05:41.475
and kind of didn't tell me.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.010
Ouch.
I have tried

05:43.010 --> 05:44.412
so hard to please him.

05:44.412 --> 05:47.548
Obviously, the only thing
Ethan Hart cares about

05:47.548 --> 05:50.017
is the fact that we
don't share the same DNA,

05:50.017 --> 05:53.286
so I'm done with him and
everything to do with him.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.122
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.425
(sighs)

05:57.425 --> 05:59.527
So, what's the new name
gonna be?

05:59.527 --> 06:00.961
I don't know yet.

06:00.961 --> 06:05.399
I used to write Zoe
Bon Jovi in my...
(laughs)

06:05.399 --> 06:07.367
Zoe Bon Jovi.
Hey!
Ow!

06:07.367 --> 06:09.102
And there's always
Zoe Wilkes.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.539
I mean, I didn't know
him; I know he was

06:11.539 --> 06:13.073
a great guy.
Although it'd be a lot

06:13.073 --> 06:15.443
of pressure for me to
win Man of the Year.

06:15.443 --> 06:17.845
(laughs)
Parents.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.747
If only we could
figure out a system

06:19.747 --> 06:21.449
where we could get
born without them.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.484
Oh, no. No, I've seen
movies like that.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.152
They never end well.
(laughs)

06:25.152 --> 06:28.956
I got to admit, I'm having some
family troubles of my own, too.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.925
My brother Harry--
he's running for state senate.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.127
And over Planksgiving,
my dad came down here

06:34.127 --> 06:36.296
and tried and get me
to take Harry's spot.

06:36.296 --> 06:40.333
But he did it by lying to me
and manipulating Lemon, and...

06:40.333 --> 06:43.471
Have you spoken
to him since?

06:43.471 --> 06:44.938
(wry laugh) No.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.874
No way.

06:46.874 --> 06:50.010
I mean, he keeps calling,
but I haven't called him back.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.012
And then, this whole
Man of the Year thing--

06:52.012 --> 06:54.648
it's almost like it doesn't mean
anything without him seeing it.

06:54.648 --> 06:55.949
You know, I just...

06:55.949 --> 06:58.285
You know what?
Maybe you got the right idea.

06:58.285 --> 06:59.720
I'm just gonna... (sighs)

06:59.720 --> 07:01.589
I'm just gonna cut him out
completely... (slicing)

07:01.589 --> 07:04.725
George, I wanted a dad.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.494
He just didn't want me back.

07:06.494 --> 07:11.499
I think that you wanting your
dad to be proud-- it's natural.

07:11.499 --> 07:15.669
you're finally ready to reach
out, and it's too late?

07:18.238 --> 07:20.974
Anyway, see you around.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.776
Um... (laughs) Yeah.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.844
(gasps)

07:23.844 --> 07:24.912
Oh. (gasps)

07:24.912 --> 07:28.181
I'm sorry.
See you around, Your Majesty.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.316
Not in the eye.
No.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.852
You just looked me
right in the eye.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.655
(chuckles)

07:36.256 --> 07:38.626
(car horn honks)

07:38.626 --> 07:40.928
(seagulls calling)

07:40.928 --> 07:43.030
(birds singing)

07:48.135 --> 07:50.237
ZOE: So,I see
it's going well.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.605
Oh, fantastic!

07:51.605 --> 07:53.941
My speech to George rivals
the Gettysburg Address.

07:53.941 --> 07:56.276
Except that the
Gettysburg Address had words.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.278
The cocktail party--
that's going to be awesome.

07:58.278 --> 08:02.482
Yeah, tailored to fit our Man
of the Year's every whim.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.518
What's this?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.688
Po Boys, shrimpy bites?

08:07.688 --> 08:10.624
Lemon came by to assure
there was no disappointment

08:10.624 --> 08:12.092
in the finger foods.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.327
This is why it's lucky
I moved to this town.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.462
I can help you.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.631
I will take care
of the entire party.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.833
Zoe, you're not even
invited to the party.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.235
It's an intimate gathering
for those who are intimate,

08:22.235 --> 08:23.704
and apparently, once were.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.938
Why, thank you.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.240
I'd be honored
to go as your plus one.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.977
No offense, but you-you planned
a party for me once before.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.179
Which is why I owe you big-time.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.380
There will be no repeat

08:33.380 --> 08:34.648
of the homecoming
debacle.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.549
I can do this.
You go write.

08:36.549 --> 08:39.519
One score and
nine years ago,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.922
Mrs. Tucker brought forth

08:41.922 --> 08:43.256
from her...

08:43.256 --> 08:45.058
lady parts...
No.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.260
No, don't make me think
about that.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.461
I just did!

08:48.461 --> 08:51.064
(keyboard keys clicking)
Delete. Delete.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.369
GEORGE:
Lemon!
George, honey,
there you are.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.006
There's no such thing as
being fashionably late

08:59.006 --> 09:01.041
when you are the
guest of honor.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.209
Hello, Lemon.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.977
Honey.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.946
Harold.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.816
I wasn't expecting
you this evening.
I just arrived.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.084
Well, why don't you go
make yourself a drink

09:11.084 --> 09:12.720
while George helps
me with this zipper?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.521
I'm sure you can
find the liquor.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.489
When it comes to alcohol,
you're like a truffle pig.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.692
(laughs)
Of course.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.096
(clears throat)
I'm so sorry to spring this

09:23.096 --> 09:24.231
on you last minute.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.700
I decided to call him
this afternoon.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.869
It was more as a courtesy
than anything, really.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.438
I didn't actually expect him
to show up.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.506
I thought that we agreed that
you weren't going to invite him.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.508
Yeah, yeah, and then...

09:35.508 --> 09:37.310
I changed my mind.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.347
All of a sudden,
you just changed your mind?

09:40.347 --> 09:41.949
Yeah, well, I realized

09:41.949 --> 09:44.584
that there were some things
that I hadn't quite considered.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.853
So, you realized that?

09:45.853 --> 09:48.221
Just came to that conclusion
all on your own?

09:48.221 --> 09:49.356
Oh.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.490
We should go.

09:50.490 --> 09:51.792
Don't want to be late

09:51.792 --> 09:54.094
for my boy's
big night.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.063
(pats shoulder)

09:56.063 --> 09:57.197
(door opens)

09:57.197 --> 09:59.232
(clears throat)

10:02.903 --> 10:05.773
MR. TUCKER:
I can't tell you

10:05.773 --> 10:08.208
how much it means
that you invited me, George.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.377
And your mom wishes she
could have made it, too.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.845
Well, her first grandbaby's
chicken pox--

10:11.845 --> 10:13.213
it's gonna trump
any awards ceremony.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.247
It's fine, Dad.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.083
Clora wanted to be
here for other reasons.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.585
We know we made mistakes
last time we were here,

10:18.585 --> 10:19.953
and we are so
deeply sorry.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.223
There shouldn't be bad
blood between family.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.557
Of course not.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.459
Oh, I'm gonna go
thank the mayor.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.095
Excuse me.
(clears throat)

10:31.264 --> 10:33.366
Does he really think
that half-baked apology

10:33.366 --> 10:35.335
is gonna erase everything
that he did to you?

10:35.335 --> 10:36.904
I will not forget what he did.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.872
But he is my father,
and he is trying.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.775
And I think as long
as he's trying,

10:41.775 --> 10:44.577
we should try and
forgive him, don't you?

10:44.577 --> 10:46.279
Sweetheart, it is
one thing to forgive,

10:46.279 --> 10:49.649
but it is another to fall into
the same abusive patterns

10:49.649 --> 10:50.984
over and over again.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.253
And I bet he has
yet another agenda.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.655
Or, he could just want to
see his son's big night.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.161
Listen, I hate

11:01.161 --> 11:03.697
that we are disagreeing
about this, all right?

11:03.697 --> 11:06.066
I realize that this
is your night, and...

11:06.066 --> 11:07.667
Oh, look who's turned

11:07.667 --> 11:08.902
into the party crasher!

11:08.902 --> 11:10.370
I have accepted the fact

11:10.370 --> 11:11.638
that you and Zoe are friends,

11:11.638 --> 11:13.440
but what I cannot
accept is the fact

11:13.440 --> 11:14.908
that she's wiggling her way

11:14.908 --> 11:16.443
into our family business.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.446
George, why would you ever
listen to her advice

11:19.446 --> 11:20.647
and invite your father?

11:20.647 --> 11:22.082
Zoe only suggested
that I invite my dad.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.884
She only did it
'cause she cares.
George,

11:23.884 --> 11:25.385
you know how she feels.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.487
She more than cares for you.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.521
Baby,

11:28.521 --> 11:29.790
we are just friends.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.159
That is all.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.693
Fine.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.695
(quietly): Fine.

11:35.695 --> 11:39.767
(sighs) Well, we don't need
to talk about it anymore.

11:39.767 --> 11:40.868
Baby, thank you.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.269
BRICK: Dash, you are looking

11:42.269 --> 11:43.403
mighty dapper tonight.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.437
I do appreciate

11:44.437 --> 11:46.907
a sartorial opportunity.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.275
This year's MOTY was, uh,

11:48.275 --> 11:51.078
was a bit of a surprise,
don't you think?

11:51.078 --> 11:54.314
Well, the voting was very,
very close, I'll tell you that.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.116
Oh, how close,
just out of curiosity?

11:56.116 --> 11:57.384
You mean why didn't you win?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.419
No, I wouldn't
have expected that.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.653
I mean...
but I would

12:00.653 --> 12:03.690
be interested to know
what the deciding factors were.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.793
Purely on a statistical level.

12:05.793 --> 12:06.960
I'll tell you this, Brick.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.095
Michael Roberts

12:08.095 --> 12:09.196
was on the
selection committee.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.530
And?
He's your daughter

12:10.530 --> 12:11.799
Magnolia's principal.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.400
I am aware. And?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.467
(chuckling): Well...

12:14.467 --> 12:17.537
it seems Magnolia
has been sassing teachers

12:17.537 --> 12:18.839
and cutting class.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.473
I'm sorry, Brick,
but the Owls believe

12:20.473 --> 12:23.710
that our children are
a reflection of ourselves.

12:23.710 --> 12:24.945
And your little angel

12:24.945 --> 12:27.147
has been a bit
of a hoo-hooo-hooligan.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.448
(chuckling)

12:29.817 --> 12:31.351
(sighs)

12:36.256 --> 12:38.391
Hey, Magnolia, what
you doing here?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.727
My dad and Lemon went off
to celebrate the MOTY

12:40.727 --> 12:42.495
and left me nothing good to eat.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.497
MOTY, I mean, even the name

12:44.497 --> 12:45.999
is embarrassing.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.468
I cannot wait till I'm old
enough to get out of here.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.569
BlueBell's not so bad.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.204
Nice people, good fishing.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.706
You just got to find the thing
that makes you want to stay.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.242
Well, what makes
you want to stay?

12:55.242 --> 12:56.810
My band for one.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.278
We're called Sippin' Whiskey.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.614
I play lead guitar, write all
the songs, pretty badass.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.016
Wait, you have a band?

13:03.016 --> 13:04.251
Nuh-uh. That...

13:04.251 --> 13:05.552
That is so cool.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.787
I tried to start a band,
but none of my friends

13:07.787 --> 13:08.922
were into it.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.323
Right on.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.893
Oh, my God,
I have the best idea!

13:12.893 --> 13:15.462
We should perform at the
MOTY thing tomorrow night!

13:15.462 --> 13:16.729
Together.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.231
What?

13:18.231 --> 13:20.033
You write a song for George,
and I'll sing it with you!

13:20.033 --> 13:21.935
Look, Magnolia,
that's a sweet idea and all...

13:21.935 --> 13:25.205
But I can sing... really good.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.875
Please, Wade, I mean,
singing with you,

13:27.875 --> 13:29.476
the coolest guy on the
whole eastern shore,

13:29.476 --> 13:32.045
would be like the highlight
of my entire stupid life.

13:32.045 --> 13:35.482
(chuckles) Well... yeah.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.616
I guess is could be

13:36.616 --> 13:37.918
kind of fun.

13:37.918 --> 13:38.952
I'll see you

13:38.952 --> 13:40.487
tomorrow for practice.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.922
Your place at noon.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.291
All right.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.759
You do realize you just made
a date with a 14-year-old?

13:46.759 --> 13:48.962
(laughs)

13:50.830 --> 13:52.499
DASH: Mr. Mayor.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.733
Yeah.

13:53.733 --> 13:54.935
Big speech time, huh?

13:54.935 --> 13:57.204
Oh, yeah.
Personally, I can't wait.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.373
I hope it's as good as the one
you gave for Harley last year.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.541
(laughs)

14:01.541 --> 14:02.609
Me, too.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.044
You'll be great.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.413
Ladies, gentlemen and Owls,
hoo-hoo.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.048
(crowd hooting)

14:08.048 --> 14:11.584
Please welcome our very
fine mayor, Mr. Lavon Hayes.

14:11.584 --> 14:12.886
Hoo!

14:12.886 --> 14:14.487
Yeah.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.489
Thank you, Dash.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.692
(clears throat)

14:19.692 --> 14:21.094
This year's

14:21.094 --> 14:23.663
Man of the Year
is George Tucker.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.133
(applause)

14:30.703 --> 14:32.940
George...

14:32.940 --> 14:34.174
is a man.

14:34.174 --> 14:37.344
Uh...

14:37.344 --> 14:39.812
Man...

14:39.812 --> 14:41.982
who is, uh, Man of the Year.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.484
And what is a man?

14:44.484 --> 14:45.752
Um, some say

14:45.752 --> 14:47.754
that comes from the Latin,

14:47.754 --> 14:49.990
"mano,"

14:49.990 --> 14:51.959
which means hand.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.360
ZOE:
Lavon?

14:53.360 --> 14:56.896
I-I am so sorry, but you
have an urgent phone call.

14:56.896 --> 14:57.864
Oh?

14:57.864 --> 14:58.898
It's the governor.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.133
Who says it's urgent.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.434
He's on the line in your study.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.470
Or she, you know,
I don't really keep up.

15:03.470 --> 15:04.237
Okay, well,

15:04.237 --> 15:06.506
uh, if you all will excuse me.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.009
ZOE:
Well, on behalf of the mayor,

15:09.009 --> 15:10.843
thank you all so much

15:10.843 --> 15:11.878
for coming.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.413
DASH:
No, no, no, no.

15:13.413 --> 15:17.684
We cannot have a MOTY cocktail
party without a speech.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.286
So, I'm sure the
mayor wouldn't mind

15:19.286 --> 15:21.488
if I just go ahead
and read it for him.
No.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.256
No, that's okay.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.393
I took a public speaking
course in college, and I got

15:26.393 --> 15:27.927
an A-plus-plus.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.762
Oh.
So, I'm really good.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.965
Okay, all right, then.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.669
(clears throat)
Okay.

15:36.669 --> 15:40.907
George Tucker is a man.

15:40.907 --> 15:44.244
A man...

15:44.244 --> 15:47.780
who saved the hardware store,

15:47.780 --> 15:49.882
A man

15:49.882 --> 15:51.784
who got Eric Sunberg

15:51.784 --> 15:52.785
his job back,

15:52.785 --> 15:54.287
who also did

15:54.287 --> 15:56.489
lots of things to make
this town love him.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.025
George...

15:58.025 --> 16:00.193
doesn't do it for money

16:00.193 --> 16:03.663
or because it makes him popular.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.799
He does it out of love.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.968
Because he loves

16:08.968 --> 16:10.603
this town.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.904
And this town

16:11.904 --> 16:13.606
is lucky to have him.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.643
Wow, I didn't know Lavon
actually liked me that much.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.212
Lucky to know someone

16:19.212 --> 16:20.980
so funny and charming.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.715
A man who listens,

16:22.715 --> 16:23.916
when he's with you.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.486
Who really hears you.

16:26.486 --> 16:30.157
Who gets you,
like no one else ever did.

16:33.193 --> 16:37.264
Says me, Lavon Hayes.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.699
Boy, the mayor
really loves

16:39.699 --> 16:40.833
the third person.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.835
(laughter)

16:42.835 --> 16:45.438
So, to George Tucker.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.880
Lavon, thank you...

16:53.880 --> 16:55.148
for that; that was...

16:55.148 --> 16:56.249
Thank you.
You're wel...

16:56.249 --> 16:57.517
Your speech was so amazing.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.587
I would... I would love
it for my-my files

17:00.587 --> 17:01.554
or to frame it

17:01.554 --> 17:03.223
to best remember
the mayor's words.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.557
Well, as long as it's...

17:04.557 --> 17:05.291
Oh, come on.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.759
This is such a great moment.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.060
We want to...

17:32.552 --> 17:33.853
(knocking)

17:33.853 --> 17:36.055
Zoe?

17:38.858 --> 17:41.128
You okay?
Do me a quickie favor,

17:41.128 --> 17:43.296
smother me to death
with this pillow?

17:43.296 --> 17:45.098
I was just trying
to cover for you,

17:45.098 --> 17:47.534
but I got carried away.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.836
Why didn't you tell me you
have a thing for George?

17:51.371 --> 17:54.941
Because I've been working
like crazy

17:54.941 --> 17:57.910
to not have a thing for George
ever since I got here.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.546
But then he walks around all

17:59.546 --> 18:02.115
Man-of-the-Year-y,
and I get carried away.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.483
Now you know.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.651
Lemon knows.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.785
Brick knows.

18:05.785 --> 18:06.953
That's gonna be fun.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.054
They know, right?

18:08.054 --> 18:09.656
Oh, they know.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.458
Oh, God.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.059
It's like something's happened
over the past few weeks,

18:13.059 --> 18:14.461
like, ever since I found out

18:14.461 --> 18:17.997
that Lemon cheated, I feel
justified in my feelings.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.299
I know that
sounds horrible,

18:19.299 --> 18:21.268
but I swear it's subconscious.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.937
I believe you,
but it does make me wonder.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.573
I mean, you have
this information.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.308
I'm not going
to tell him, Lavon.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.609
What if you were drunk?

18:30.277 --> 18:31.944
What if Lemon chases you

18:31.944 --> 18:34.147
through Town Square with an ax?

18:34.147 --> 18:36.015
I've pictured that many times.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.350
But I still wouldn't tell.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.286
You said yourself,
some things are subconscious.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.322
My subconscious knows
not to betray my best friend.

18:42.322 --> 18:45.091
I promise, you have
nothing to worry about.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.626
I, on the other hand,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.995
have to find another
secret dead parent

18:48.995 --> 18:50.330
to leave me
their medical practice,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.064
'cause I can never
face those people again.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.300
I may just have to change

18:53.300 --> 18:57.304
my name to Zoe Harlot Pariah.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.506
Sounds like a Pilgrim.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.975
* *

19:02.975 --> 19:05.345
GEORGE: Babe, you can't
 really be jealous

19:05.345 --> 19:06.479
of her right now.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.047
I mean, we nearly
eloped last week.

19:08.047 --> 19:11.751
We are in a great place, babe,

19:11.751 --> 19:15.988
and nothing and no one
is gonna come between us.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.458
But you listened to her

19:18.458 --> 19:20.026
about inviting
your dad here,

19:20.026 --> 19:23.230
and you didn't even bother to
tell me that he was coming.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.997
I listened to her because
she had a point.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.133
He is my father.

19:27.133 --> 19:30.670
And I want...

19:30.670 --> 19:34.374
I just need to have a
relationship with him.

19:34.374 --> 19:38.511
Well, I think that I
know you, pretty well, too.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.946
And I know your father.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.814
And I'm sorry, baby,
but I don't trust him.

19:41.814 --> 19:45.051
And he may act nice, but...
Babe, this might
be hard to believe,

19:45.051 --> 19:48.187
but I really do think
the man is trying to change.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.656
He skipped a quarterly meeting

19:49.656 --> 19:52.659
with his partners to come
down here and be here tonight.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.695
He didn't even skip that meeting
for my high school graduation.

19:59.799 --> 20:04.170
George, I love that you want
to see the best in people,

20:04.170 --> 20:05.538
but please be careful.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.440
Because sometimes,
seeing the best

20:07.440 --> 20:09.576
just means not seeing the truth.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.382
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.450
Where do you think
you're going, young lady?

20:17.450 --> 20:18.685
Wade Kinsella's.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.287
We're performing
at the MOTY tonight.

20:20.287 --> 20:22.422
Over my dead body.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.090
You're gonna stay home,

20:24.090 --> 20:25.492
and you are gonna
do your homework.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.694
But there's no
homework this weekend.

20:27.694 --> 20:30.330
They wanted us to focus all
our attention on the MOTY.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.464
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.699
You listen to me, young lady.

20:32.699 --> 20:33.866
I spoke to Principal Roberts.

20:33.866 --> 20:37.169
I know what's
going on at school.

20:37.169 --> 20:40.440
Your attitude, your bad grades.

20:40.440 --> 20:44.577
Now, I expect all bad behavior
to cease immediately.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.714
Now, you get on back to your
room, and you get to work.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.683
Okay.

20:50.683 --> 20:51.718
Sorry, Daddy.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.487
That's a good girl.
(sighs)

20:54.487 --> 20:57.590
I'll be in my study
if you need any help.

20:57.590 --> 21:01.294
* George Tucker,
he's the Man of the Year *

21:01.294 --> 21:05.732
* BlueBell's own superhero *

21:05.732 --> 21:08.635
* George Tucker,
let's drink a beer-o *

21:08.635 --> 21:13.039
* To my old pal George *

21:13.039 --> 21:14.341
That was good.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.476
Yeah, we kind of need to
change that last line.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.844
But I like that line.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.312
Yeah, but you can't
drink a beer.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.047
It is just a song,

21:21.047 --> 21:22.081
and it's great.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.383
You're so talented, Wade.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.318
Thanks. Well,
not exactly Bob Dylan.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.619
Seriously,

21:26.619 --> 21:28.287
I think it's a travesty
that George Tucker

21:28.287 --> 21:29.789
is Man of the Year
and not you.

21:29.789 --> 21:33.192
I mean, who cares if he has
a fancy job or whatever.

21:33.192 --> 21:35.628
The MOTY should go to someone
who stands for something.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.297
And what is it you
think I stand for?

21:38.297 --> 21:39.666
Not giving a rat's ass.

21:39.666 --> 21:42.068
It's not like
I don't care about anything.

21:42.068 --> 21:45.071
I mean, what is the big deal
about George Tucker anyway?

21:45.071 --> 21:46.506
Oh, my God.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.640
You know what I overheard

21:47.640 --> 21:49.008
my sister saying?
What?

21:49.008 --> 21:49.942
That Dr. Zoe Hart made

21:49.942 --> 21:51.778
a complete fool of
herself last night

21:51.778 --> 21:53.780
and recited some
totally overboard speech

21:53.780 --> 21:55.515
about what a
dreamboat George is.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.249
BRICK: Magnolia Breeland!

21:57.249 --> 21:59.251
You are grounded
until further notice.

21:59.251 --> 22:00.787
Give me a break, Dad.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.789
It's not like I'm
in a crack house.
I told you

22:02.789 --> 22:05.124
to do your homework;
I forbade you to come here.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.426
Look, I had no idea.
When are you

22:06.426 --> 22:08.395
gonna realize that
your actions reflect poorly

22:08.395 --> 22:10.930
upon me and poorly
on our family?

22:10.930 --> 22:13.165
Your choices,
your associations...

22:13.165 --> 22:14.434
What associations, Dad?

22:14.434 --> 22:16.235
Certain associations,

22:16.235 --> 22:17.870
which do not show

22:17.870 --> 22:18.971
you or your family

22:18.971 --> 22:20.373
in their best light.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.808
That is all.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.776
You are grounded;
you're beyond grounded. Come on.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.745
Let's go home.
Fine.

22:25.745 --> 22:26.713
Fine, Dad!

22:36.155 --> 22:38.357
* *

22:42.762 --> 22:45.998
If you'd wanted to apologize, a
phone call would have sufficed.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.037
How could you let Zoe Hart
embarrass us all like that?

22:51.037 --> 22:53.906
Yeah, about her.

22:53.906 --> 22:57.376
I-I should've been honest
as soon as I...

22:57.376 --> 23:00.580
I would feel dishonest
if I didn't...

23:00.580 --> 23:02.214
Okay, just spit it out.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.583
Please, I have

23:03.583 --> 23:05.217
a hundred things
to do before tonight.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.919
Zoe knows.

23:06.919 --> 23:07.920
Zoe knows what?

23:07.920 --> 23:09.155
What does Zoe know?

23:09.155 --> 23:10.923
About us.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.464
How the hell did that happen?

23:17.464 --> 23:19.098
She figured it out.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.500
I tried to lie.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.469
Well, you should've
tried harder!
Lemon, it's okay.

23:22.469 --> 23:23.703
You don't have to worry.

23:23.703 --> 23:24.971
She won't tell anyone.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.739
Well, if you were
so confident about that,

23:26.739 --> 23:28.340
then why are you
telling me right now!

23:28.340 --> 23:29.609
I'm only telling you
so you know.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.411
Oh, my God, Zoe Hart
is walking around

23:32.411 --> 23:33.980
with the very information

23:33.980 --> 23:36.849
that could completely undo
my entire relationship.

23:36.849 --> 23:37.584
She won't.

23:37.584 --> 23:40.620
You know what, you did this.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.655
You put me in a corner;
I have to tell him now.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.824
I have to tell him
before she does.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.126
I could lose him over this,

23:47.126 --> 23:50.930
I could lose everything
that's important to me.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.565
* *

24:03.009 --> 24:04.744
TUCKER:
You're a complete mess.

24:04.744 --> 24:06.345
Oh, there he is,
man of the hour!

24:06.345 --> 24:07.446
George,

24:07.446 --> 24:09.281
I want you to
meet Cleve Wallace.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.050
Cleve is a reporter for
the Birmingham Gazette.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.585
Congratulations
on the award, George.

24:12.585 --> 24:13.986
That's quite an honor.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.454
Thank you.
Uh,

24:15.454 --> 24:17.724
if you have a few moments, I'd
like to ask you a few questions.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.526
Of course he does.

24:19.526 --> 24:21.761
He's gonna do a
story on you, son.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.462
Um, I'm sorry,
but why would someone

24:23.462 --> 24:26.065
from the Birmingham Gazette
care about BlueBell's

24:26.065 --> 24:27.634
Man of the Year?

24:27.634 --> 24:30.803
Well, I... I know the Tuckers.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.039
We've known each
other for some time.

24:33.039 --> 24:36.242
And I've been covering
your brother's campaign.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.179
Right.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.816
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Wallace,

24:43.816 --> 24:45.451
but right now's actually
not a great time.

24:45.451 --> 24:46.519
I got to go home

24:46.519 --> 24:48.821
and get ready for tonight.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.857
Festivities and all,
if you'll excuse me.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.259
Dad.

24:57.630 --> 25:02.001
(phone ringing)

25:02.001 --> 25:04.671
George!

25:04.671 --> 25:06.806
How's my Man of the Year?

25:06.806 --> 25:09.876
Not too good, actually,
as it turns out.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.011
Why? W-What's wrong?

25:12.011 --> 25:15.014
You were right,
I am too trusting of people.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.716
'Cause My dad
does have an agenda.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.250
He brought a reporter
to town with him.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.687
Obviously just wants
to do a puff piece on Harry.

25:20.687 --> 25:24.657
Oh, uh, I'm, I'm really sorry
to hear that.

25:24.657 --> 25:25.825
You okay?

25:25.825 --> 25:27.594
Your voice sounds
a little weird.

25:27.594 --> 25:28.795
I'm fine. Listen.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.630
We can just talk
about it after the gala.

25:30.630 --> 25:31.831
It's-it's no worries.

25:31.831 --> 25:32.665
Hey.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.166
I love you.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.170
I love you.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.778
WADE: * Old George Tucker's *

25:45.778 --> 25:47.113
* A hell of a guy *

25:47.113 --> 25:51.250
* Just watch him spread
his wings and fly *

25:51.250 --> 25:54.821
* He's mama's boy,
he's daddy's son *

25:54.821 --> 25:58.891
* Well, look out now,
he's the chosen one *

25:58.891 --> 26:01.427
* Get out of the way,
for old George Tucker *

26:01.427 --> 26:05.464
* That blinding light's
his halo, sucker. *

26:05.464 --> 26:06.866
Nice song.

26:06.866 --> 26:10.837
Won't be a dry eye
in the audience.

26:10.837 --> 26:14.073
Oh, thanks.
I'd love one.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.341
(chuckles)

26:15.341 --> 26:18.377
Zoe Scotch.

26:18.377 --> 26:21.513
Zoe Scott.

26:21.513 --> 26:22.949
Oh, whatever.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.416
You okay?

26:24.416 --> 26:25.752
I am great.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.287
As are you, I'm guessing.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.355
What's with the song?

26:29.355 --> 26:30.723
What?

26:30.723 --> 26:33.492
I said I would write a
tribute to the Golden Boy.

26:33.492 --> 26:36.295
I wrote a tribute
to the Golden Boy.

26:36.295 --> 26:39.598
The upstanding citizen
from the upstanding family

26:39.598 --> 26:42.168
who's made all the right...

26:42.168 --> 26:45.772
upstanding decisions
his whole life.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.874
I just hope it tops your speech.

26:47.874 --> 26:50.242
I hate small towns.

26:50.242 --> 26:54.180
Yeah, most people would've
given up on him

26:54.180 --> 26:56.582
when they found out
he had a fianceé.

26:56.582 --> 26:58.751
Not me.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.687
Hm-mm, the more unavailable
they are,

27:00.687 --> 27:01.888
the better I like them.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.656
There's probably
a book on it.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.491
Daddy Issues for Dummies.

27:05.491 --> 27:07.259
Hey, thanks, Dad.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.929
No, mm-mm, Dr. Hart,

27:09.929 --> 27:11.163
for another life lesson.

27:11.163 --> 27:14.133
You know, my mom
gave me his number.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.302
Maybe I should call him
and thank him

27:16.302 --> 27:19.538
for all the gift
that keeps on giving.

27:19.538 --> 27:20.539
Thank you.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.875
Come on, Doc.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.543
It's not that he's
emotionally unavailable

27:24.543 --> 27:27.814
that makes you
love George Tucker.

27:27.814 --> 27:30.917
It's the fact that
he's George Tucker.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.553
Well. I gotta go.

27:34.553 --> 27:37.423
I gotta go serenade
Golden Boy, okay?

27:37.423 --> 27:38.958
So, please, excuse me.
Mm-hm.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.027
(clears throat)
You have fun.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.428
Oh, hey!

27:42.428 --> 27:43.830
I just thought of

27:43.830 --> 27:46.833
a great rhyme for Tucker.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.035
(both laughing)

27:52.271 --> 27:54.106
Oh! Thank you so much.

27:55.474 --> 27:57.076
Thank you.

27:57.076 --> 28:01.213
Well, wasn't that a wonderful
performance by Shula Whitaker

28:01.213 --> 28:04.383
and her dancing cat,
Prince Purrfection!

28:04.383 --> 28:07.419
You really don't see dancing
cats enough these days...

28:07.419 --> 28:09.355
Wade. Hey, um...

28:09.355 --> 28:11.490
I... I can't believe
you're doing this, man.

28:11.490 --> 28:15.361
I'm-I'm... I just want
to tell you, it really
means a lot to me,

28:15.361 --> 28:16.729
so... thank you.

28:16.729 --> 28:18.364
Yeah.

28:18.364 --> 28:21.133
DASH: ...performing with one of
Big Blue's former tight ends,

28:21.133 --> 28:23.836
ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...

28:23.836 --> 28:27.139
Magnolia Breeland
and Wade Kinsella!

28:32.544 --> 28:34.346
Uh...

28:34.346 --> 28:38.751
I'm sorry to say, uh, Magnolia
won't be performing tonight.

28:39.651 --> 28:41.854
She's grounded.

28:42.889 --> 28:45.091
I'm just gonna say that, uh...

28:46.859 --> 28:50.462
...my buddy George,
he's a great guy.

28:50.462 --> 28:53.065
And... (clears throat) and....

28:53.065 --> 28:55.367
(microphone squeals
with feedback)

28:55.367 --> 28:58.370
And he deserves this.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.274
He deserves everything.

29:05.444 --> 29:06.745
(audience murmuring)

29:08.214 --> 29:09.448
Well, uh...

29:10.682 --> 29:15.287
Thank you, Wade, for that, uh,
minimalist performance!

29:15.287 --> 29:16.455
Very post-modern.

29:16.455 --> 29:17.723
(Dash chuckles)

29:17.723 --> 29:21.627
Well, without further ado,
let's bring on the Belles!

29:21.627 --> 29:23.762
(upbeat piano begins)

29:24.530 --> 29:27.834
* You're the top *

29:27.834 --> 29:30.102
* You're the Coliseum *

29:30.102 --> 29:32.104
* You're the top *

29:32.104 --> 29:33.539
* You're the Louver Museum *

29:33.539 --> 29:35.908
* Ooh... *
* You're a melody *

29:35.908 --> 29:38.144
* From a symphony by Strauss *

29:38.144 --> 29:39.711
* You're a Bendel bonnet *

29:39.711 --> 29:41.047
* A Shakespeare sonnet *

29:41.047 --> 29:44.016
* You're Mickey Mouse *

29:44.016 --> 29:45.784
* You're the Nile *

29:45.784 --> 29:47.319
* You're the Tower of Pisa... *

29:47.319 --> 29:49.055
They're sending you
out on that?
Yeah.

29:49.055 --> 29:51.924
Dash has never been one
for understatement, so...

29:51.924 --> 29:53.625
* You're the smile
on the Mona Lisa *

29:53.625 --> 29:57.029
* I'm a worthless check,
a total wreck, a flop... *

29:57.029 --> 29:58.464
Just thought I'd,
uh, wish you luck.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.166
You know what, Dad?
You can cut the crap.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.800
Excuse me?
Don't act like you give

30:01.800 --> 30:03.302
a monkey's ass about my award.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.204
'Cause I know you're only
here to do a piece for

30:05.204 --> 30:06.705
Harry's campaign, 'cause
it's always about him.

30:06.705 --> 30:09.808
* And I can feel after
every line, a thrill divine *

30:09.808 --> 30:11.143
* Down my spine *

30:11.143 --> 30:13.279
* Now gifted humans
like Vincent Youmens *

30:13.279 --> 30:15.614
* Might think that
your song is bad *

30:15.614 --> 30:18.050
* But I've got a notion,
I'll second the motion *

30:18.050 --> 30:20.186
* And this is what
I'm going to add... *

30:20.186 --> 30:21.520
George, what are
you talking about?

30:21.520 --> 30:23.956
No reporter from Birmingham
decides to come down

30:23.956 --> 30:26.625
to cover BlueBell's
Man of the Year award

30:26.625 --> 30:28.194
for no reason.
(sighs)

30:28.194 --> 30:29.795
* You're Napoleon brandy *

30:29.795 --> 30:32.164
* Ooh... *
* You're the purple light *

30:32.164 --> 30:34.100
* On a summer night in Spain *

30:34.100 --> 30:35.501
* You're the National Gallery *

30:35.501 --> 30:39.338
* Garbo's salary,
you're cellophane *

30:39.338 --> 30:41.140
* You're sublime... *

30:41.140 --> 30:43.275
And I must have been some
kind of idiot to think that

30:43.275 --> 30:46.278
you would come down here
for something I cared about

30:46.278 --> 30:47.813
without having some
kind of agenda...

30:47.813 --> 30:50.049
Son, I'm here. I'm trying
to make up for what I did.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.884
Son, give me
the benefit of the doubt!
Why should I?

30:51.884 --> 30:52.919
So you can use me again?

30:52.919 --> 30:54.921
So you can use my fianceé?

30:54.921 --> 30:56.222
To be honest with you,
I don't even know

30:56.222 --> 30:57.423
why I invited you here.
I don't even know,

30:57.423 --> 30:59.125
because you're not
going to change.

30:59.125 --> 31:01.193
Because you are never going to
change, and because you are

31:01.193 --> 31:03.629
the most selfish person I've
ever met, and I'm done.
George, don't say that!

31:03.629 --> 31:06.065
We're done, Dad!
Dad...

31:06.065 --> 31:08.700
* I'm a toy balloon
that's faded *

31:08.700 --> 31:09.902
* Soon to pop *

31:09.902 --> 31:11.303
* But if, baby, I'm the bottom *

31:11.303 --> 31:13.305
* You're the top! *

31:13.305 --> 31:15.374
DASH: Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. George Tucker.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.875
Where is he?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.310
(Lemon panting)

31:18.310 --> 31:20.646
George!

31:20.646 --> 31:22.214
(murmuring)

31:22.214 --> 31:23.882
George?

31:23.882 --> 31:25.184
I don't know,
he just collapsed.

31:25.184 --> 31:28.087
Um... can you get Brick?
And call an ambulance?

31:28.087 --> 31:30.456
Okay?
Okay.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.191
LEMON:
Daddy!

31:32.191 --> 31:34.326
Dad, I'm here, okay?

31:34.326 --> 31:36.662
I'm... I'm right here.

31:36.662 --> 31:39.065
I'm here.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.432
It's going to be okay.

31:53.712 --> 31:56.015
I wish I had better news.

31:58.217 --> 32:01.353
It wasn't just
a simple heart attack.

32:01.353 --> 32:04.856
Harold suffered what we call
a myocardial rupture.

32:04.856 --> 32:06.825
Okay, what does that, um...

32:06.825 --> 32:08.160
What does that mean exactly?

32:08.160 --> 32:10.096
Some of his heart muscle died.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.999
And that muscle started to leak,
and the leak spread,

32:12.999 --> 32:14.366
and it ruptured
his mitral valve.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.602
And that's going to require
surgery to fix it.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.937
Oh, my God.
We're doing
everything we can.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.472
I've already called
in a great surgeon

32:20.472 --> 32:24.076
from Montgomery that I know,
Ed Baker. He's on his way.

32:24.076 --> 32:27.413
Is my dad gonna be okay, Brick?

32:27.413 --> 32:30.416
I hope so, son.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.184
I hope so.

32:37.356 --> 32:38.757
Hi.

32:38.757 --> 32:39.992
Ooh.

32:39.992 --> 32:41.593
I thought you were grounded.

32:41.593 --> 32:43.529
Oh. Well... yeah.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.164
They're all
at the hospital anyway.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.799
Look, I-I'm sorry if I got you
in trouble earlier.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.336
No. You did not.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.871
I got myself in trouble.

32:52.871 --> 32:54.940
Guess I made him really mad
this time.

32:54.940 --> 32:58.344
You know,
you should listen to him.

32:58.344 --> 32:59.811
Brick's a good man.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.113
He's just

33:01.113 --> 33:03.349
trying to turn you
into a good woman.

33:03.349 --> 33:05.817
I know,
but what he said about you--

33:05.817 --> 33:06.952
that was totally lame.

33:06.952 --> 33:08.620
Well, I suppose
if you walk around

33:08.620 --> 33:10.522
pretending like
you don't give a rat's ass,

33:10.522 --> 33:13.225
you can't very well blame 'em
when they think I don't.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.794
You know, my-my grandma
used to always say,

33:15.794 --> 33:17.563
"You are the choices you make."

33:19.665 --> 33:23.335
Hey, you-you want
a cup of coffee or tea, some

33:23.335 --> 33:25.737
truly delicious-looking
leftovers?

33:25.737 --> 33:28.507
Um, no, but

33:28.507 --> 33:32.378
maybe you could give me a ride
to the hospital?

33:36.482 --> 33:38.884
Get ahold
of Harry yet?
Um...

33:38.884 --> 33:41.987
yeah. Yeah.
He's, uh...

33:41.987 --> 33:44.123
He's leaving the campaign trail,

33:44.123 --> 33:46.392
and my mom's
on her way, too, so...

33:46.392 --> 33:48.827
Okay.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.396
He's gonna be fine.

33:50.396 --> 33:53.299
He's... I just know
that he's going to be fine.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.401
Baby, he's going
to be fine.

33:55.401 --> 33:56.602
Wasn't there, um, something

33:56.602 --> 33:58.937
you wanted to talk
to me about earlier?

33:58.937 --> 34:00.672
Oh, no. It's fine.

34:00.672 --> 34:03.008
We'll talk about
it another time.

34:03.008 --> 34:04.976
George?

34:04.976 --> 34:08.147
I hope I'm not
interrupting. I...

34:08.147 --> 34:10.882
I just wanted to see
how your father is.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.418
Look, Mr. Wallace, I...

34:12.418 --> 34:15.254
With all due respect, we are
going through a family emergency

34:15.254 --> 34:16.822
right now, and I am sure

34:16.822 --> 34:19.558
that your puff piece on Harry
can wait a couple of days.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.893
Well, I'm not writing
about Harry.

34:22.893 --> 34:25.297
Your father is
an old friend.

34:25.297 --> 34:28.065
He called, asked me
to do a piece on you.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.203
He's really

34:31.203 --> 34:33.239
very proud of you.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.542
Please wish him
the best for me.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.311
Yes, sir.

34:39.311 --> 34:40.911
Honey, he's going
to be fine, okay?

34:40.911 --> 34:42.313
Your father will
understand...

34:42.313 --> 34:45.016
Yeah? What if he doesn't
get the chance, Lemon?

34:45.016 --> 34:47.819
Look, I accused him of not
caring, I called him selfish

34:47.819 --> 34:49.420
because you...

34:49.420 --> 34:50.856
And now, the last thing

34:50.856 --> 34:53.391
my dad might remember me
ever saying to him is

34:53.391 --> 34:55.694
how much I hated him.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.696
(footsteps retreating)

34:59.565 --> 35:01.633
I just can't stand
not knowing how he's doing.

35:01.633 --> 35:02.834
Yeah, I know.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.070
Maybe I should call the
hospital and check in.

35:05.070 --> 35:06.372
You know, from
what everyone's

35:06.372 --> 35:08.540
saying, it sounded like
he had a heart attack.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.376
I do have a background
in cardiothoracics.

35:10.376 --> 35:11.743
I'm not sure
you're the person

35:11.743 --> 35:14.079
the family most wants
to hear from at the moment.

35:14.079 --> 35:15.181
Yeah, you're probably right.

35:15.181 --> 35:16.482
Listen, Zoe,

35:16.482 --> 35:20.252
you should know
that I told Lemon that

35:20.252 --> 35:23.222
you... know.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.724
I'm guessing she was thrilled.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.526
Smoke was pretty much exuding
from her ears.

35:27.526 --> 35:30.862
She accused me of telling you
so she'd have to tell George.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.063
Well, did you?

35:32.063 --> 35:33.665
What?! No.

35:33.665 --> 35:34.866
That's crazy.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.168
Is it?

35:36.168 --> 35:38.069
Because I know
that you trust me.

35:38.069 --> 35:39.738
And I know
that you know,

35:39.738 --> 35:42.007
if I said I would never tell,
I mean it.

35:42.007 --> 35:43.709
So, why else
would you tell Lemon?

35:44.743 --> 35:46.812
Good God.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.248
You may be right.

35:50.081 --> 35:51.250
Am I a terrible person?

35:51.250 --> 35:53.519
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

35:53.519 --> 35:55.086
(laughing):
No. Look,

35:55.086 --> 35:56.388
you just don't want to see

35:56.388 --> 35:58.424
the two of them
walk happily into the sunset.

36:01.126 --> 36:02.428
(sighs)

36:02.428 --> 36:05.497
Thanks for
the ride, Wade.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.200
You're a good guy, but we
can't be seen together.

36:08.200 --> 36:09.801
(laughs)

36:09.801 --> 36:14.039
Yeah, if I had a nickel
for every time I've heard that.

36:14.039 --> 36:16.141
I'm gonna go
get some coffee.

36:16.141 --> 36:17.543
Yeah. Yeah, I'll, uh....

36:17.543 --> 36:19.745
I'll go check on George.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.519
(footsteps approaching)

36:27.519 --> 36:28.854
(sighs)

36:29.855 --> 36:31.823
Hey.
Hey.

36:35.461 --> 36:38.096
You know, Ed and I--
we go way back.

36:38.096 --> 36:42.133
He's a good man,
he's a great surgeon.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.370
But you know,
if that was my father,

36:44.370 --> 36:47.172
I would want the best
in the whole world,

36:47.172 --> 36:50.509
and-and you have access to that.

36:50.509 --> 36:52.143
Who?

36:52.143 --> 36:55.247
Zoe's father,
Dr. Ethan Hart.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.317
No.

36:58.317 --> 37:01.653
No, they are, um... estranged.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.555
Um, she...

37:03.555 --> 37:05.190
She wants to
change her name...

37:05.190 --> 37:07.259
I know that, but

37:07.259 --> 37:10.762
I also know she would
call him for you.

37:13.565 --> 37:17.536
Yeah, which is why I cannot
ask her to do that for me.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.305
Okay.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.741
Yeah, you know,
he's in good hands with Ed,

37:22.741 --> 37:25.076
so don't you worry
about a thing.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.279
GEORGE:
Yeah.

37:30.148 --> 37:32.117
Hey.

37:32.117 --> 37:33.952
You okay, honey?

37:33.952 --> 37:37.188
Just worried about
Harold, that's all.

37:37.188 --> 37:40.292
Yeah.

37:40.292 --> 37:44.062
Magnolia Breeland,
you are grounded.

37:44.062 --> 37:46.197
You are supposed
to be at home.

37:46.197 --> 37:47.533
This is hardly

37:47.533 --> 37:48.934
a wild night out, Daddy,

37:48.934 --> 37:51.437
and I figured hanging out
with you here was the same

37:51.437 --> 37:53.071
as hanging out with you at home.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.373
(sighs)

37:54.373 --> 37:55.641
Besides, it...

37:55.641 --> 37:57.275
it might be
a long night,

37:57.275 --> 37:59.545
so... I brought you these.

37:59.545 --> 38:01.447
How'd you even get here anyway?

38:01.447 --> 38:05.016
I took the bus.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.653
Oh, I'm sure you did.

38:09.220 --> 38:11.423
(Lavon clears
his throat)

38:15.226 --> 38:17.228
Found a name?

38:17.228 --> 38:19.230
Zoe Downey, Jr.

38:19.230 --> 38:21.232
(chuckles)

38:21.232 --> 38:22.901
I'm a big Iron Man fan.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.403
Yeah, okay.

38:24.403 --> 38:28.474
Well, I figured
I could use a name to aspire to.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.709
Hmm.
Yeah.

38:30.709 --> 38:33.078
I don't know
if I'll live up to him.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.746
The kindness to
the patients.

38:36.247 --> 38:38.384
The good will, all those MOTYs.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.051
I think you'll do just fine.

38:40.051 --> 38:41.720
(door opening)
WADE: Hey.

38:41.720 --> 38:42.754
ZOE: Hey.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.856
I'm, uh, just coming
from the hospital.

38:44.856 --> 38:47.526
Is George's dad okay?
I don't...
I don't really know.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.928
I overheard him saying
that he's got a...

38:49.928 --> 38:52.731
a myocardial rupture.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.466
Who's doing the surgery?

38:54.466 --> 38:57.002
Well, that's the thing.

38:57.002 --> 39:00.839
See, uh, George would never
ask you himself,

39:00.839 --> 39:03.542
but he needs you to make a call.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.898
(sighs)

39:28.233 --> 39:32.070
Dad... it's Zoe, your daughter.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.440
* *

39:44.282 --> 39:46.518
You got frosting on your nose.

39:46.518 --> 39:49.120
(Brick chuckles,
Lemon sniffles)

39:51.857 --> 39:54.125
How is he?

40:00.331 --> 40:03.268
What the hell is she doing here?

40:03.268 --> 40:05.471
It's okay, Lemon.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.280
Zoe. Um...

40:15.280 --> 40:18.083
Hey. I heard about your dad.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.085
Yeah. Um...

40:20.085 --> 40:22.287
He's gonna be okay.

40:22.287 --> 40:24.289
We got a good surgeon.

40:24.289 --> 40:27.493
But now you have a great one.

40:27.493 --> 40:28.794
I called my father.

40:28.794 --> 40:31.196
He'll be here tomorrow.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.904
