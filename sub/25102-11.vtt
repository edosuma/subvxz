WEBVTT

00:00.446 --> 00:02.469
That's
Lena's foster home.

00:02.547 --> 00:04.707
The house is very nice.

00:04.890 --> 00:07.528
There's a swing set
in the backyard.

00:07.648 --> 00:09.984
Now you know
where she is.

00:10.137 --> 00:12.622
Where is my money?

00:12.700 --> 00:15.720
I don't know where
your Goddamn money is!

00:21.776 --> 00:25.177
So the boys gave you your cut
of the money already, huh?

00:25.246 --> 00:27.135
No, but they will.
They know

00:27.262 --> 00:29.359
not to screw
the idea man.

00:29.464 --> 00:33.334
You're never gonna see
a penny of that money.

00:40.133 --> 00:42.519
Billy cleared out
the bar safe.

00:42.596 --> 00:45.022
This is what you wanted,

02:22.585 --> 02:24.428
You have plans today?

02:28.591 --> 02:29.983
No, not really.

02:30.061 --> 02:32.890
I need us to
go run an errand.

02:33.598 --> 02:35.439
Where?

02:36.048 --> 02:38.092
You drive.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.635
Okay.

02:43.118 --> 02:44.652
Look at you.

02:44.807 --> 02:46.540
You're all grown up.

03:02.759 --> 03:04.759
There's eggs in there
if you want any.

03:04.827 --> 03:07.562
No, this is cool.

03:07.630 --> 03:10.186
You need
a shower here.

03:10.503 --> 03:13.283
I was gonna hit the ones
at the beach in a little bit.

03:13.474 --> 03:15.906
You need
a real place to live.

03:16.172 --> 03:17.972
I'm good.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.774
Something
on the Strand?

03:19.842 --> 03:21.842
Walk the surf,
walk to work?

03:21.911 --> 03:23.043
You'd have a shower.

03:23.113 --> 03:24.979
Yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

03:25.047 --> 03:26.307
If you had a shower?
Yeah.

03:26.385 --> 03:29.221
No,
the walk the surf part.

03:29.657 --> 03:32.653
So, you're, uh, leaving for
South Africa pretty soon, right?

03:32.731 --> 03:34.522
Mm-hmm.

03:35.125 --> 03:36.514
You good on cash?

03:36.688 --> 03:38.392
Oh, I'm good.

03:38.645 --> 03:39.928
Some big French board builder

03:39.996 --> 03:43.339
is gonna float me through
the South Africa events.

03:43.743 --> 03:45.265
Good for you, man.

03:45.343 --> 03:49.137
Hey, I'm really sorry
about your dad.

03:49.205 --> 03:51.940
Yeah. You know,
I should've seen it coming.

03:52.008 --> 03:53.474
The guy was a junkie.

03:53.543 --> 03:54.809
How's Smurf doing?

03:54.877 --> 03:56.544
She mellow out at all
in jail?

03:56.613 --> 03:58.212
Um...

03:58.552 --> 04:00.949
she bought us all
burial plots.

04:03.551 --> 04:05.354
Wow.

04:18.434 --> 04:19.624
So?

04:21.237 --> 04:24.372
We gonna talk about jobs
or... or what?

04:26.316 --> 04:28.636
How are you, man?
You good?

04:31.381 --> 04:33.581
Great.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.031
Good talk.

04:48.829 --> 04:50.172
I give up.
What are we doing here?

04:50.283 --> 04:51.928
That's where she is.

04:52.397 --> 04:53.530
Who?

04:53.670 --> 04:55.603
Lena.

04:55.923 --> 04:57.283
Looks nice.

04:57.361 --> 04:59.111
It's not nice.
It's foster care.

04:59.230 --> 05:00.408
They got other kids there?

05:00.579 --> 05:01.475
They got another girl.

05:01.544 --> 05:03.277
- Well, that's great, man.
- It's not great!

05:03.346 --> 05:06.648
You think her living with
a bunch of strangers is great?

05:11.780 --> 05:13.506
Your friend Rudy
can still get

05:13.584 --> 05:15.627
driver's licenses
and passports, right?

05:15.786 --> 05:17.145
Yeah, why?

05:17.360 --> 05:19.823
Me and Lena
need new I.D.s.

05:19.966 --> 05:21.455
Wait.

05:21.564 --> 05:23.764
No.
You can't...

05:23.953 --> 05:25.033
No, man.

05:25.101 --> 05:26.891
I got the cash
from the plane job.

05:26.969 --> 05:28.837
A-A-And what are you gonna do?
You gonna kidnap Lena?

05:28.905 --> 05:30.371
Bail on the family?

05:30.440 --> 05:33.307
Y-You're on parole,
man, all right?

05:36.593 --> 05:38.458
Jesus.

05:42.751 --> 05:44.697
What about you?

05:44.860 --> 05:47.582
You haven't done time
since juvie.

05:47.990 --> 05:50.310
They would let you
adopt her.

05:51.753 --> 05:54.327
I'll do all the work.
You wouldn't have to do shit.

05:54.597 --> 05:56.188
No.

05:56.807 --> 05:59.222
Look.

05:59.666 --> 06:04.243
Can... can we just talk
and have some breakfast, okay?

06:12.220 --> 06:13.414
Smurf?

06:13.483 --> 06:15.420
911.

06:15.818 --> 06:17.618
Great.

06:55.308 --> 06:56.640
Everything okay?

06:56.726 --> 06:57.858
You know it.

07:03.522 --> 07:05.255
Oh, yeah.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.135
Gracias, Ma.

07:10.006 --> 07:11.806
'Sup, guero?

07:14.811 --> 07:15.991
Who are they?

07:16.069 --> 07:17.798
What the hell's
going on, Smurf?

07:19.281 --> 07:24.495
I've always done what I thought
was best for the family.

07:24.718 --> 07:28.156
I know it hasn't
always been popular,

07:28.394 --> 07:33.561
but it has always been
the right thing to do.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.871
The money Baz stole
from my storage unit

07:42.949 --> 07:45.438
belongs to all of us.

07:45.589 --> 07:48.709
We're here, Smurf.
What do you want?

07:48.821 --> 07:52.872
Now, Baz and I had
our disagreements, no doubt.

07:53.095 --> 07:55.316
I forgave him.

07:55.677 --> 08:00.566
But we cannot let
what Lucy did slide.

08:00.701 --> 08:03.171
Jesus Christ, Smurf, how many
times do we have to tell you?

08:03.274 --> 08:05.994
No, we're not gonna do this shit
for you, okay?

08:06.109 --> 08:07.195
My God.

08:07.263 --> 08:11.799
Your brother was murdered
in his driveway,

08:11.868 --> 08:14.268
and the bitch
that walked away from it

08:14.337 --> 08:18.806
has just turned up
with all our money.

08:18.875 --> 08:20.341
Is that good with you,
Deran?

08:20.410 --> 08:24.527
No one's going to Mexico,
all right, Smurf?

08:28.976 --> 08:30.885
All right, Craig.

08:31.230 --> 08:34.022
No one
is going to Mexico.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.248
You kidnapped Marco?

09:02.326 --> 09:04.093
I did what I had to do.

09:05.888 --> 09:08.022
Marco told you
he took our money?

09:08.090 --> 09:10.424
Yes, Andrew.
Yes.

09:10.493 --> 09:14.362
Now, Lucy's gonna want
her brother back.

09:14.430 --> 09:16.897
What if she doesn't,
Smurf, huh?

09:16.899 --> 09:18.232
We get to shoot Marco
in the head

09:18.301 --> 09:20.034
and then
bury him in the desert.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.302
Does that sound right?

09:30.580 --> 09:32.580
Four grown men here,

09:32.649 --> 09:36.116
and I am the only one
with a pair of balls.

09:36.186 --> 09:38.452
Out back.

09:38.521 --> 09:41.322
Talk about it out back,
come on.

09:41.391 --> 09:42.790
A week, guys.

09:42.859 --> 09:45.726
She's been back
a week, man.

09:45.795 --> 09:47.127
Anybody else
wake up today

09:47.197 --> 09:48.462
thinking they were gonna have
a normal day?

09:48.531 --> 09:49.930
She's gonna
get us all killed.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.866
I told you she wouldn't
take no for an answer.

09:51.934 --> 09:53.267
We don't even know
if Lucy took it.

09:53.336 --> 09:54.802
- Now we do.
- Bullshit.

09:54.871 --> 09:56.070
Who knows
what Marco told her

09:56.138 --> 09:57.739
trying to get her to stop
hurting him, man?

09:57.816 --> 09:59.674
It ain't right.
It's not right.

09:59.742 --> 10:01.009
We wouldn't be
standing here

10:01.077 --> 10:02.877
if Lucy didn't take that money,
okay?

10:02.945 --> 10:05.613
Smurf decided
that she was gonna do this

10:05.682 --> 10:07.818
as soon as
we told her no.

10:11.291 --> 10:13.754
I'm not gonna start a war
with some cartel bitch

10:13.823 --> 10:16.557
who smuggles drugs and people
for a living.

10:16.710 --> 10:18.288
We can still
walk away from this.

10:18.366 --> 10:19.427
He's right.

10:19.641 --> 10:21.161
Just let Smurf
deal with it.

10:22.048 --> 10:23.288
No.

10:23.384 --> 10:25.704
Lucy's gonna think it was
all of us no matter what.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.108
Smurf knows it.

10:30.462 --> 10:32.973
God damn it.

10:37.174 --> 10:39.914
We're handling this
from now on in.

10:40.033 --> 10:41.449
Not you.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.384
How do you
want to do it?

10:43.791 --> 10:45.920
Tell Lucy
where to drop the money.

10:45.988 --> 10:47.655
Once we pick it up,

10:47.954 --> 10:50.658
we tell her
where she can find Marco.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.381
She won't
go for it.

10:53.738 --> 10:56.521
This is gonna have to be
a face to face.

10:56.599 --> 10:58.066
Somewhere neutral,
then.

10:58.276 --> 11:00.200
If Lucy knows the place
ahead of time,

11:00.270 --> 11:01.602
we're screwed.

11:01.772 --> 11:03.671
It's too risky
to move Marco.

11:03.908 --> 11:06.301
What,
you want to do it here?

11:06.863 --> 11:08.142
It's better than
getting pulled over

11:08.210 --> 11:12.639
with a Mexican national tied up
and bleeding in your trunk.

11:12.940 --> 11:16.150
One of us could meet her
close by and bring her here.

11:24.636 --> 11:25.769
J.

11:28.740 --> 11:29.873
Why me?

11:29.951 --> 11:32.834
She won't expect you to
be as dangerous, baby.

11:35.554 --> 11:40.621
There's a restaurant
off the 67... Dino's.

11:41.549 --> 11:44.312
I'm not doing this without
a lot of firepower.

11:44.816 --> 11:46.556
Okay.

11:46.783 --> 11:48.783
J needs to
scout the restaurant.

11:48.851 --> 11:52.420
He can swing by the house
and get our gear.

11:54.324 --> 11:55.589
Go, baby.

12:23.963 --> 12:25.036
<i>Bueno.</i>

12:25.234 --> 12:28.587
<i>Sorry, my Spanish
is a little rusty.</i>

12:30.221 --> 12:31.501
Smurf.

12:31.620 --> 12:34.762
You have some things
that belong to me.

12:34.973 --> 12:36.631
What are you
talking about?

12:36.761 --> 12:40.852
Jewelry, watches,
platinum bars,

12:41.066 --> 12:44.665
cut stones,
uncut stones, cash.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.976
Totaled,
we're north of $7 million.

12:48.185 --> 12:49.345
I'm confused.

12:49.472 --> 12:52.855
Are you still pretending
that you didn't steal from me?

12:55.852 --> 13:01.022
Because that's not the story
that your brother is telling.

13:04.661 --> 13:06.587
Is Marco with you?

13:06.841 --> 13:08.396
He is.

13:12.735 --> 13:15.469
Whatever it is
you think I did,

13:15.657 --> 13:18.138
it's between me and you,
Smurf.

13:18.296 --> 13:19.973
Marco has nothing
to do with it.

13:20.116 --> 13:22.810
He does now, baby.

13:25.033 --> 13:26.146
What do you want?

13:26.256 --> 13:28.216
I want my money.

13:30.986 --> 13:34.121
So you're holding my brother
for ransom?

13:34.253 --> 13:36.120
It's not ransom.

13:36.268 --> 13:38.150
It's restitution.

13:44.381 --> 13:46.565
I'm gonna give you
a few hours

13:46.643 --> 13:48.836
to gather all my things
together,

13:48.948 --> 13:53.770
then I will call you with a time
and a place to meet.

13:54.151 --> 13:56.448
<i>Answer your phone.</i>

14:01.804 --> 14:04.100
<i>Puta.</i>

14:05.425 --> 14:06.425
<i>Jefa.</i>

14:12.328 --> 14:13.527
<i>Ahora.</i>

14:17.867 --> 14:20.000
What's up?
I have customers.

14:20.481 --> 14:23.203
Did you know that Pete and Smurf
kidnapped somebody?

14:23.906 --> 14:25.139
No.

14:25.207 --> 14:26.674
Who'd they grab?

14:28.225 --> 14:30.657
Got someone that
stole from Smurf.

14:30.808 --> 14:33.638
She's saying that
they killed Baz, too.

14:34.106 --> 14:37.151
Smurf wants me to bring
this guy's sister to a meet.

14:37.270 --> 14:38.912
Why you?

14:39.221 --> 14:41.701
Because she doesn't care
if I get killed.

14:43.545 --> 14:45.030
Damn, dude.

14:45.173 --> 14:46.761
You got
a hard-ass <i> abuela.</i>

14:51.753 --> 14:53.301
Look,
I got to get back to work.

14:53.369 --> 14:54.827
I need your help.

14:55.104 --> 14:56.917
- Today?
- Right now.

14:58.641 --> 15:00.174
Look,
I'm not going in there

15:00.243 --> 15:03.111
without someone
watching my back, okay?

15:05.428 --> 15:06.962
$300.

15:08.994 --> 15:11.185
Because I like you.

15:29.494 --> 15:32.295
Deran's moving the cars.

15:35.514 --> 15:39.413
I know how hard this is for you,
Andrew.

15:39.828 --> 15:43.618
You did everything you could
to try to warn Baz about Lucy.

15:43.686 --> 15:45.730
So did I.

15:48.369 --> 15:51.728
Women were always
his weakness.

15:52.184 --> 15:58.321
What was your backup plan
if we said no?

15:58.575 --> 16:01.008
I didn't have one.

16:12.383 --> 16:14.049
Where's Smurf?

16:14.317 --> 16:15.984
Outside with Pope.

16:21.046 --> 16:22.437
Does he ever shut up?

16:22.515 --> 16:24.946
Nope.

16:27.291 --> 16:28.831
Think he might
be hungry.

16:28.931 --> 16:31.131
What do you want to eat,
Marco?

16:31.201 --> 16:35.092
You want, uh, prime rib,
lobster?

16:38.826 --> 16:40.675
Maybe we get him a water
or something.

16:40.743 --> 16:41.767
He'll be fine.

16:41.845 --> 16:43.445
He's gonna be home
in a few hours anyway.

16:53.089 --> 16:55.480
I'm gonna
get him a water.

17:19.602 --> 17:22.250
Should've told Baz
about Lucy.

17:22.935 --> 17:24.128
Baz was a grown man.

17:24.207 --> 17:26.119
He had to know
what she was into.

17:26.188 --> 17:30.725
We knew how dangerous she was
and we didn't say shit.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.461
Baz got himself killed,
man.

17:33.529 --> 17:35.063
What's that
supposed to mean?

17:35.131 --> 17:36.522
It means if he hadn't
ripped off Smurf,

17:36.599 --> 17:38.066
the money would still
be in the storage unit

17:38.134 --> 17:40.140
and we wouldn't be dealing with
any of this right now.

17:46.409 --> 17:50.210
All that shit about
going outside the family.

17:50.212 --> 17:54.399
And she hires gangbangers
to nab Marco behind our backs.

17:54.844 --> 17:58.476
Makes you wonder what else
she's been keeping from us.

18:25.600 --> 18:26.781
What took you so long?

18:26.849 --> 18:28.216
Traffic.

18:29.852 --> 18:31.652
- You got the vests?
- Yeah.

18:41.063 --> 18:42.196
No, baby.

18:42.265 --> 18:44.906
You can't wear that
to go meet Lucy.

18:45.049 --> 18:46.066
Why not?

18:46.144 --> 18:47.335
I'll put a sweatshirt
over it.

18:47.403 --> 18:49.467
She'll notice.

18:49.618 --> 18:54.368
Lucy wants this to go
very smoothly.

18:54.812 --> 18:59.699
We need her to believe
that we trust her, okay?

18:59.882 --> 19:01.749
Okay.

19:58.474 --> 20:00.064
What's gonna stop me
from grabbing you

20:00.142 --> 20:02.010
and taking you to Mexico
right now?

20:02.373 --> 20:04.412
Smurf wouldn't care.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.416
That's why I'm here.

20:06.527 --> 20:09.253
You brought a friend.

20:16.475 --> 20:19.215
Why don't you tell me
what I'm walking into?

20:19.429 --> 20:20.561
What do you mean?

20:20.563 --> 20:22.036
Your uncles?

20:22.377 --> 20:25.047
Or did Smurf hire
outside muscle,

20:25.190 --> 20:27.435
like when she
had Baz killed?

20:34.112 --> 20:36.662
How many men
did you bring with you?

20:37.059 --> 20:38.379
Three.

20:41.479 --> 20:43.183
We just want
our money back.

20:43.253 --> 20:44.655
We?

20:44.885 --> 20:46.921
You realize
your uncles protect Smurf

20:46.989 --> 20:48.144
'cause
she's jerked them off

20:48.222 --> 20:50.503
since they were little boys,
right?

20:51.909 --> 20:55.483
You're smart enough to know
she's just using you.

20:56.078 --> 20:58.332
You're smart enough to see that
when Smurf's done with someone,

20:58.401 --> 21:01.330
she just throws them away.

21:01.545 --> 21:03.612
Are you done?

21:08.147 --> 21:09.420
Vamos.

21:27.666 --> 21:29.830
One black Suburban,
three guys.

21:29.899 --> 21:31.365
You wait with Marco.

21:31.434 --> 21:33.157
Open the front door
when they get here.

21:33.235 --> 21:34.835
I'll bring them in.

22:17.908 --> 22:18.970
Where is he?

22:19.048 --> 22:21.750
Where are my things?

22:33.220 --> 22:34.228
Craig.

23:01.994 --> 23:03.694
Where's the rest of it?

23:05.327 --> 23:07.461
You said
you wanted what I took.

23:07.530 --> 23:08.951
There it is.

23:09.122 --> 23:11.056
Where's the cash?

23:13.301 --> 23:15.621
Why don't you ask your sons,
Janine?

23:17.473 --> 23:21.210
Because Baz gave them their cut
before you had him killed.

23:24.681 --> 23:26.701
That's what I took.

23:26.915 --> 23:30.285
Did you expect me
to fence it for you?

23:33.408 --> 23:35.275
Are we doing this
or not?

23:39.161 --> 23:40.961
Just take it, Smurf.

23:54.176 --> 23:55.910
Put everything
in the truck.

24:06.950 --> 24:09.048
You think this shit's over,
huh?!

24:09.126 --> 24:10.262
I'm gonna blast all

24:10.340 --> 24:12.540
- you punk asses tomorrow, watch!
- Shut up, Marco!

24:13.073 --> 24:14.736
You sicko bitch.

24:14.814 --> 24:15.930
You're done.

24:15.998 --> 24:17.197
Shut up.

24:17.267 --> 24:18.666
All of you!

24:25.075 --> 24:26.541
Go, go, go!

24:29.746 --> 24:30.945
Get down, get down!

24:31.013 --> 24:32.413
Stay down!

24:38.088 --> 24:39.620
Stay down. Stay down.

24:49.832 --> 24:51.699
<i>IVamanos!</i>

25:07.850 --> 25:09.117
Are you hit?

25:09.185 --> 25:10.447
No, no, I'm good. Are you?
Are you okay?

25:10.524 --> 25:12.587
- Shit.
- I hit Marco, man.

25:12.655 --> 25:14.923
Where's Pope?

25:14.991 --> 25:16.925
Where's Pope?

25:29.754 --> 25:32.072
We're getting Pope now.

25:32.476 --> 25:34.121
All right?
We need to think.

25:34.296 --> 25:36.070
We need to go.

25:36.148 --> 25:38.135
Where are we gonna go, Craig?
Mexico?!

25:38.213 --> 25:40.310
We'll go to Lucy's place.
We start there.

25:40.461 --> 25:43.347
And do what, Craig, huh?
What do we do?

25:43.425 --> 25:45.019
We can't go to Mexico
and take on Lucy's men.

25:45.087 --> 25:47.087
We don't have the firepower,
we don't have the numbers.

25:47.157 --> 25:49.424
Pope's gone, man!

25:51.161 --> 25:52.587
Is that
how you'd do me?

25:52.698 --> 25:55.095
Just sit here
with your thumb up your ass

25:55.165 --> 25:56.697
while I'm getting my ears
hacked off?!

25:56.766 --> 25:58.790
Stop.

25:59.101 --> 26:00.786
We're gonna get him back,

26:00.865 --> 26:03.904
but we need to keep our heads
and think it through.

26:03.906 --> 26:05.305
Oh,
think it through?

26:05.307 --> 26:07.842
Is that what you did
when you went behind our backs

26:07.910 --> 26:10.177
and took Marco
in the first place?

26:10.408 --> 26:12.913
I did that for the family,
and you know it.

26:12.983 --> 26:14.314
Oh, yeah,
I bet you did.

26:14.316 --> 26:16.917
Bullshit, Smurf.
This was about you.

26:16.919 --> 26:18.786
You did this shit
for you.

26:18.855 --> 26:21.922
If we had let Lucy
steal from us,

26:21.924 --> 26:23.591
we would be finished.

26:23.660 --> 26:26.257
Finished?

26:26.566 --> 26:28.329
None of us wanted to do this
in the first place!

26:28.331 --> 26:32.842
Not Craig, not me,
not Pope!

26:33.183 --> 26:37.515
If Pope is dead,
this is on you, Smurf.

26:37.740 --> 26:39.206
This is on you!

26:43.461 --> 26:44.640
And you.

26:44.767 --> 26:46.280
You knew
those gangbangers.

26:46.349 --> 26:48.416
What? Yeah, you think I
didn't see it, but I saw it.

26:48.484 --> 26:50.751
- Craig...
- J wanted to do this all along,

26:50.820 --> 26:52.152
and since
he's been here,

26:52.222 --> 26:55.089
Cath's gone missing,
Baz is dead, and now this!

26:55.157 --> 26:56.624
Back off of him.
Back off of him.

26:56.693 --> 26:58.092
Wait, you expect me to believe
he had nothing to do with this?

26:58.160 --> 26:59.493
This isn't the time for this
right now!

26:59.562 --> 27:01.495
- What, you're taking his side?!
- Stop it!

27:01.564 --> 27:03.231
This isn't the time
for this shit!

27:03.299 --> 27:04.832
What, are you
taking his side now?

27:04.901 --> 27:05.834
- No, I'm not.
- Enough!

27:05.902 --> 27:07.782
- You taking his side?
- Enough!

27:11.241 --> 27:14.601
I'm the one
that took Marco.

27:15.189 --> 27:18.215
No one wanted it to go down
like this.

27:18.390 --> 27:20.180
All that matters now
is Pope,

27:20.182 --> 27:22.884
and stop acting
like babies.

27:26.522 --> 27:30.058
J, go get the suitcases
from the truck.

27:33.863 --> 27:35.063
It's okay.

27:35.131 --> 27:37.465
We're gonna find him.
It's okay.

Baz, me, Carlos, Lena.

30:54.397 --> 30:55.730
I warned you.

30:55.798 --> 30:56.798
You lied to me.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.331
You knew.

30:59.409 --> 31:01.275
You knew it was Smurf.

31:01.353 --> 31:04.338
You told me you didn't
take Smurf's money.

31:04.407 --> 31:05.473
You told me.

31:05.542 --> 31:07.007
You looked me in the eye
and lied to me.

31:07.077 --> 31:09.877
This isn't about money.

31:09.946 --> 31:11.412
Mexico.

31:11.481 --> 31:12.747
You dragged me down there,

31:12.815 --> 31:15.483
you... you were just
covering your tracks.

31:15.552 --> 31:17.217
I was trying to
show you the truth.

31:17.287 --> 31:18.645
What truth?

31:18.914 --> 31:22.022
That you left Baz alone
in the street to die

31:22.092 --> 31:24.626
and then ripped him off?

31:29.165 --> 31:32.100
I stole from Smurf.

31:32.398 --> 31:34.635
Baz was gone.

31:40.110 --> 31:42.143
He loved you.

31:46.182 --> 31:48.849
But you know what?

31:48.927 --> 31:52.531
I don't think you ever
forgave him for Cath, did you?

31:54.145 --> 31:58.115
Maybe that's why you didn't give
a shit that Smurf killed him.

31:59.595 --> 32:03.598
With Baz gone, you'd have
all of Mommy's attention

32:03.666 --> 32:06.935

you piece of shit.

32:19.081 --> 32:21.081
You know how this ends.

32:44.798 --> 32:47.383
Andrew?

32:49.095 --> 32:52.240
Where is he?

32:52.644 --> 32:55.812
I want to speak to my son.

32:57.167 --> 32:58.961
We need to talk.

33:02.616 --> 33:03.824
So talk.

33:03.893 --> 33:05.560
No.

33:06.030 --> 33:07.836
Face to face.

33:08.097 --> 33:09.661
<i>Somewhere safe.</i>

33:09.804 --> 33:11.474
Safe for who?

33:15.269 --> 33:16.988
Both of us.

33:17.194 --> 33:19.641
<i>Pope had nothing
to do with this.</i>

33:19.909 --> 33:22.177
This is all me.

33:24.560 --> 33:28.216
Drive to National City
and wait for my call.

33:31.388 --> 33:33.203
My brother's dead.

33:48.583 --> 33:51.184
I'm going to
meet Lucy now.

33:51.340 --> 33:52.354
Alone.

33:52.432 --> 33:54.704
Is Pope alive?

33:54.839 --> 33:56.127
I don't know.

34:01.818 --> 34:03.150
Well,
we're coming with you.

34:03.219 --> 34:05.099
- No.
- That's bullshit.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.021
You can't go alone,
Smurf.

34:07.148 --> 34:08.289
It's too dangerous.

34:08.357 --> 34:11.092
Lucy has the upper hand
right now.

34:11.159 --> 34:13.155
These are her terms.

34:15.239 --> 34:17.760
Since when have you cared
about that before?

34:20.503 --> 34:22.168
Marco is dead.

34:27.510 --> 34:29.456
Oh, shit.

35:15.558 --> 35:17.758
It's about time.

35:17.827 --> 35:19.967
What happened?

35:20.117 --> 35:21.850
Shit went south.

35:22.332 --> 35:23.739
They took Pope.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.909
Is that
where Smurf is going?

35:25.987 --> 35:27.320
Yeah.

35:27.570 --> 35:28.836
Are you good, though?

35:28.905 --> 35:31.186
Did anybody else
get hurt?

35:32.175 --> 35:34.004
I saved Smurf.

35:34.432 --> 35:37.812
Pulled her out the way.
I covered her till it was over.

35:44.253 --> 35:46.387
I'm gonna
need you again soon.

35:47.097 --> 35:49.824
$500 next time.

36:02.511 --> 36:07.269
They took Pope and we just
let it happen, man.

36:07.544 --> 36:10.630
Hey, we were trying
not to get shot, okay?

36:14.597 --> 36:17.798
Something happens to Pope,
this is...

36:18.287 --> 36:20.840
this is on Smurf,
not on us.

36:23.492 --> 36:25.660
Pope, man.

36:31.230 --> 36:34.132
Crazy bastard picked me up
for breakfast this morning

36:34.210 --> 36:38.116
to take me to, uh,
Lena's foster home.

36:40.710 --> 36:43.683
He wanted me to...

36:44.127 --> 36:46.462
to help him steal her,

36:46.843 --> 36:49.988
move her to the mountains
or some shit.

36:50.456 --> 36:54.414
Says maybe, uh,
they'd let me adopt her.

36:56.726 --> 36:58.966
And he was serious,
too.

37:01.423 --> 37:03.922
You know that weird-ass look
he gets, you know?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.067
Hey, stop.

38:01.506 --> 38:03.594
Where is he?

38:07.003 --> 38:08.703
Close.

38:09.219 --> 38:11.633
Is he alive?

38:15.604 --> 38:18.930
What happened to Marco
was, um...

38:20.181 --> 38:22.432
unfortunate.

38:24.477 --> 38:27.174
This was supposed to
be business.

38:27.515 --> 38:29.954
He started shooting.

38:30.184 --> 38:33.086
You kidnapped him.

38:33.395 --> 38:34.656
Tortured him.

38:37.441 --> 38:42.913
When someone steals
$7 million from you,

38:43.511 --> 38:45.913
you handle it.

38:50.296 --> 38:52.507
Like you handled Baz?

38:55.705 --> 38:58.628
I didn't kill Baz,
Lucy.

38:59.501 --> 39:01.526
You did.

39:02.686 --> 39:06.921
You poisoned him
against his own family.

39:09.940 --> 39:13.409
He found out that you were
stealing from him,

39:13.596 --> 39:15.462
from all of them.

39:15.532 --> 39:17.589
Stealing?

39:18.157 --> 39:21.740
That money
is my boys' future.

39:22.034 --> 39:26.133
I'm sure you have a little
nest egg for Carlos.

39:26.641 --> 39:29.058
Don't say
my son's name.

39:33.016 --> 39:38.086
Do you remember the first time
you came to my house, Lucy?

39:39.713 --> 39:41.488
No.

39:42.205 --> 39:44.636
I do.

39:45.438 --> 39:49.309
You and Baz and Pope,

39:49.899 --> 39:53.281
swimming, drinking.

39:53.813 --> 39:58.700
Someone took $200
from my top drawer that day.

39:59.271 --> 40:02.721
Eventually,
Baz came clean,

40:03.149 --> 40:05.112
told me he did it.

40:05.842 --> 40:10.299
He bought you a necklace
in the mall.

40:15.260 --> 40:17.814
I loved him.

40:19.444 --> 40:24.966
I raised Baz
from when he was 12 years old.

40:27.789 --> 40:30.875
Where's my son, Lucy?

40:35.723 --> 40:37.957
Tell me you did it.

40:41.006 --> 40:42.835
You want Pope?

40:42.954 --> 40:46.354
Tell me
you had Baz killed.

40:48.390 --> 40:50.135
Say it.

40:54.967 --> 40:57.826
Yes.

40:58.930 --> 41:00.301
Yes, what?

41:13.077 --> 41:15.790
I had Baz killed.

41:41.016 --> 41:44.411
7321 Rivera Way.

41:44.574 --> 41:46.080
Chula Vista.

41:50.553 --> 41:54.123
You come anywhere near me

41:54.423 --> 41:56.395
or my family,

41:56.720 --> 41:59.050
and I will kill you

41:59.328 --> 42:01.552
and the rest
of your sons.
