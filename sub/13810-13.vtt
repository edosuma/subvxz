(<i> Grunts</i> )

12:09.979 --> 12:11.021
Huh?

12:11.105 --> 12:13.315
Okay, maybe something
gets by the squid.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.901
Cover her, Squid!
Come on!

12:18.696 --> 12:19.780
Otto: Sweet!

12:19.864 --> 12:20.990
Yeah!

12:21.073 --> 12:21.991
Um, you missed?

12:22.074 --> 12:24.577
In your dreams.
What's the score?

12:24.660 --> 12:27.413
Oh, I think about five trillion
to nothing.

12:27.496 --> 12:28.789
We're keeping score?

12:28.873 --> 12:30.040
That's just an estimate...

After rounding down.

12:32.001 --> 12:32.710
Otto and Reggie:
Woogety, woogety, woogety!

Could you please, for once,

12:35.087 --> 12:37.506
not do the Rocket
dance of humiliation?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.175
Go, Otto, go, Reggie.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.719
It's your birthday,
it's your birthday.

12:41.802 --> 12:43.012
Lighten up, Sammy.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.680
Hey, everybody
loses to the Rockets.

12:44.763 --> 12:47.850
Just be glad
that when it really counts

12:47.933 --> 12:48.517
we're on the same team.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.603
I'm just glad it's over.

12:50.686 --> 12:53.939
Me, too.
Let's get some grindage.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.569
Ray: One for you,
one for you, and...

12:58.652 --> 13:00.362
Who ordered the diet?

13:00.446 --> 13:01.530
That was me.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.824
I need to wash down
this triple-decker.

13:07.661 --> 13:08.662
Thanks, Dad.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.581
You know, Reggie
and I worked out

13:10.664 --> 13:12.041
a new kickin'
power drive.

Cool!
Will you teach it to us?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.295
Nah. Hyuh!

Nah. Hyuh!

13:16.378 --> 13:18.339
{\an3}That's okay, we can play
with my cousin, Clio.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.382
She's coming in
to town tomorrow.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.009
Great,
that's all we need --

Reggie in another
fight with Clio.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.264
Clio's coming? Cool!
Excellent!

13:27.348 --> 13:29.683
We can check out that new shop
on the strand.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.311
Whoo-hoo!
Let's buy clothes.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.021
It's a skateboard shop,

13:34.104 --> 13:36.941
Well, I'm not going with you
and the ballerina.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.526

I feel like beating
Sam and Twist again.

Weren't you listening?
Clio's coming!

13:42.988 --> 13:44.114
Later!

13:44.198 --> 13:46.200
But what about
Team Rocket?

and let's scrimmage --

13:57.503 --> 14:00.589
me and Sam against you.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.384
Two against one?
That's no fair.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.345
What's the matter, Otto?
Scared?

14:06.428 --> 14:08.931

Let's hit it.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.359
Hey, Clio!

14:20.442 --> 14:22.194
Oh, Reggie!

14:23.404 --> 14:25.823
Oh, I think
I'm going to cry.

Must you
ruin everything?

14:26.615 --> 14:28.409
You get used to it.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.578
Oh, Reggie,

14:30.661 --> 14:32.913
I have the biggest P.S.
to my last e-mail.

14:32.997 --> 14:36.125
{\an1}Looks like the girls
have some catching up to do.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.419
Okay, okay,
we're wasting time.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.546
Let's get out of here
and get our skates on.

14:40.629 --> 14:41.630
I want hockey.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.383
Can you chill for
one second of your life?

14:44.466 --> 14:46.802
Can't you see
we want to hang for awhile?

14:46.885 --> 14:48.596
Is there a skate shop
around here?

14:48.679 --> 14:51.307
All of my pads are so scuffed.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.267
There's this great
little shop on the strand...

14:55.894 --> 14:58.647
Forget about Reggie.
She's busy with Clio.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.440
Thanks a lot, Twist.

14:59.523 --> 15:02.192
Why are you mad at me?

15:02.276 --> 15:04.361
She's <i> your</i> cousin.

Where do you
plug them in?

15:13.078 --> 15:16.206
{\an1}Hey, guys, I figured Clio
might want to check out

15:16.290 --> 15:17.124

15:18.667 --> 15:20.669
Kind of crude...

15:20.753 --> 15:22.755
But I suppose it
gets the job done.

15:22.838 --> 15:25.633
Oh, sorry it's not
as fancy as your blades

15:25.716 --> 15:28.927
but as far as getting the job
done, watch this.

Whoa-ho!

15:37.269 --> 15:40.189
See, actually, I like to do
something like that

15:40.272 --> 15:41.732
only I break at the knee
and point my toe.

gives me more...air.

with the Rockets.

on a routine -- let's see it.

through that practice, anyway.

with the problem,<i> you</i> are.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.988
What are you talking about?

19:58.071 --> 20:00.824
{\an3}You can hang around with Clio
or be part of Team Rocket,

but not both.

in the way of that.

to tell you something.

No, but I think

get rid of the wind,
