WEBVTT

00:02.293 --> 00:04.212
(dog barks in distance)

00:05.672 --> 00:07.257
Is there a cake?

00:07.340 --> 00:08.758
{\an3}You're a girl.
Bake one.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.927
{\an1}Valerie would check it
for poison.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.262
BRANDON: Come on, Kel.
We're working kind of

00:12.345 --> 00:13.346
last-minute here.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.557
David only decided
on a surprise party last night.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.475
{\an1}Hmm. Oh, did we
get her a present?

00:17.559 --> 00:19.602
{\an1}BRANDON: No, but David got her
this lovely trinket,

00:19.686 --> 00:21.229
that he had me
pick it up for him.

00:21.312 --> 00:23.189
{\an1}Oh, can we all
put our names on it?

00:27.152 --> 00:28.111
(gasps)

00:28.194 --> 00:29.446
Surpri... Oh.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.614
Sorry we're late.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.116
What is this?

00:33.199 --> 00:34.325
Uh, I brought Valerie a dress.

00:34.409 --> 00:38.913
Oh, a Donna Martin original.
How exceptionally giving of you.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.582
Call me a sucker on birthdays.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.167
They'll be on the racks
tomorrow at MayaLee's.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.752
Oh, I love that store.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.003
You guys are in business.

00:45.086 --> 00:46.004
Congratulations.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.922
Thanks.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.299
So, you finished
the whole order?

00:49.382 --> 00:51.092
Oh, only 20.

00:51.176 --> 00:54.095
I thought the store said they
didn't need them until Friday.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.930
Yeah, but they said
if I got done early,

00:56.014 --> 00:57.474
{\an1}I could just take them
over there.

00:57.557 --> 01:01.019
Donna, you were
in the emergency room last week.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.146
I know, and now I'm fine.

01:03.229 --> 01:06.024
Don't worry. Thank you,
but this is a good thing for me.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.484
All right.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.111
(car engine humming)

01:10.195 --> 01:11.362
I just heard a car.

01:12.530 --> 01:13.782
STEVE:
Don't touch that switch.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.825
{\an1}Too late.
Don't hit the switch.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.035
{\an3}You were supposed
to be watching.

01:17.118 --> 01:18.328
{\an1}David was gonna
hit his flashers.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.621
Oh, just get over there.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.249
KELLY AND DONNA:
Surpri...

01:25.752 --> 01:27.170
{\an1}Well, where's
our birthday girl?

01:27.253 --> 01:28.671
Late, luckily.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.424
23 years ago, 11:18 a.m.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.509
{\an3}And she's still
a late riser.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.302
(Bill laughing)

01:34.385 --> 01:35.804
Just like her mom.

01:36.888 --> 01:37.806
{\an3}STEVE:
Well...

01:37.889 --> 01:38.890
there's my boy.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.683
{\an1}All right, those are the
headlights I was looking for.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.685
David and Valerie are here.

01:42.769 --> 01:43.686
I can't wait to see her.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.021
I have the most marvelous
surprise for her.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.397
(car doors closing)

01:47.232 --> 01:49.025
(light switch clicks)

01:49.984 --> 01:52.195
{\an3}You know, I
like this house.

01:52.278 --> 01:56.199
{\an1}Really? You didn't seem
too crazy about me taking it.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.535
Well, I wanted to be with
you, but I'm glad it's here.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.536
{\an1}Hmm...

01:59.619 --> 02:03.331
Mmm, where we can be alone.

02:03.414 --> 02:04.707
Alone? It's your birthday.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.876
All the more reason.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.002
Mmm.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.219
ALL:
Surprise!

02:16.302 --> 02:17.387
{\an3}ABBY: Happy Birthday,
sweetheart.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.889
BILL:
Happy Birthday.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.724
I called everyone yesterday. I
thought for sure you overheard.

02:21.808 --> 02:22.725
STEVE:
Next year, you got to

02:22.809 --> 02:24.102
{\an1}give us a
little more warning.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.770
{\an3}Yeah, I kind of wish
I had some, too.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.272
Let me get you
a birthday drink.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.107
Look at that expression.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.192
{\an3}It's like you're
12 years old again.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.735
{\an3}That was her first
surprise party.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.071
She just burst into tears.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.239
{\an3}VALERIE:
Um, Brandon,

02:36.322 --> 02:37.365
let me help you with that.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.575
No, no, no.
Let him get it.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.244
{\an1}This is your party.
It's all about you, honey.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.288
You felt it, didn't you?

02:43.371 --> 02:44.581
Feel what?

02:44.664 --> 02:46.207
Bill, she's onto us.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.126
(laughing)

02:48.209 --> 02:51.296
Uh, on to what?
What, what's going on?

02:53.339 --> 02:54.382
The ring.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.219
We're getting married.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.433
Congratulations.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.226
{\an1}Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

03:07.562 --> 03:11.149
{\an1}Well, uh, you guys
will be sisters now.

Oh, well!

05:06.973 --> 05:08.558
{\an1}Right this way.
It's a very limited edition.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.852
{\an1}Even more limited,
since we just made a sale.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.395
What time did you get here?

05:12.478 --> 05:15.565
{\an1}Oh, about five minutes
before the store opened.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.734
Donna, I got to tell you
I'm really proud of you.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.694
Thank you. Oh, wait, wait.

05:19.777 --> 05:22.572
That woman right there, she's
the one that bought my dress.

05:22.655 --> 05:23.573
SALESWOMAN:
Oh, well, that's...

05:23.656 --> 05:25.700
Is she returning it?

05:25.783 --> 05:28.536
{\an3}It's probably
the wrong size.

05:28.619 --> 05:31.414
What are you doing?

05:31.497 --> 05:32.415
Okay, we'll just...

05:32.498 --> 05:33.583
{\an3}Excuse me.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.418
{\an5}Are you returning
this dress?
Yes.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.586
Why? Do you like it?

05:36.669 --> 05:38.713
Oh, yes, I do very much.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.590
I was just wondering
why you don't.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.258
Is it the cut or the fabric,
or...?

05:42.341 --> 05:43.259
I thought it was a

05:43.342 --> 05:45.094
Donna Karan, at this price.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.637
{\an1}I was almost out
of the store when I

05:46.721 --> 05:48.139
realized it's a Donna Martin.

05:48.222 --> 05:49.766
Whoever that is.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.018
(laughing):
Right.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.612
Val, stop.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.113
I'll finish this
later, all right?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.323
I want to give
you something.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.115
I want to help.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.200
{\an3}I don't care.
You're not going to.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.327
You're not going to clean
up after your own party.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.453
Especially one you hated.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.164
Oh, it was my mother who
turned it into a firing squad.

06:13.247 --> 06:14.207
It's not your fault.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.458
{\an1}Yeah, she just
wasn't thinking.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.626
She didn't care.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.252
Val, she's in love.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.295
It'll pass.
Even without a wedding.

06:19.378 --> 06:21.297
I mean, I'm supposed
to meet Kelly in an hour.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.590
We're gonna make sure of it.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.759
You guys really think

06:24.842 --> 06:26.511
you're gonna stop your parents
from getting married?

06:26.594 --> 06:28.304
She doesn't even know
what love means.

06:28.387 --> 06:30.515
He's a convicted felon.
Call me optimistic.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.308
You sure didn't seem it
last night.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.811
It's just that I hate birthdays.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.312
{\an3}I mean, ever
since I was a kid.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.981
Fake sentiments, smiling
on command for the camera.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.566
{\an3}"Look, honey. See what
a happy family

06:40.650 --> 06:42.401
we are!" Please.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.778
Val, I'm trying
to make you feel better here.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.864
I'm sorry.

06:46.948 --> 06:50.493
It's just that my mom used to
give me a charm

06:50.576 --> 06:52.453
for my charm bracelet
every year.

06:52.537 --> 06:55.414
Uh, the-the one on your bureau?

06:55.498 --> 06:57.708
Yeah, I hated that thing.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.378
{\an3}But I've never been
able to get rid of it.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.630
Kind of like my past.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.345
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

07:09.428 --> 07:12.640
Yeah, this will
bring up the bad ones.

07:17.728 --> 07:18.646
{\an3}(sneezing)

07:18.729 --> 07:20.314
Janet, go home.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.024
{\an3}Oh, thanks, but I think
I'm going to stay.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.359
You're sick.

07:23.442 --> 07:24.360
Well, it beats

07:24.443 --> 07:25.361
starving.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.654
No sick pay.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.239
(sniffles, sneezes)

07:28.322 --> 07:29.657
(phone rings)

07:29.740 --> 07:31.826
Ah, maybe that's for me.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.870
I entered a contest
for medical insurance.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.371
So, keep your fingers crossed.

07:35.454 --> 07:38.583
Beverly Beat

07:38.666 --> 07:40.042
What's the matter
with you, Steve?

07:40.126 --> 07:41.377
You sick, too?

07:41.460 --> 07:43.379
Yeah, maybe a little.

07:43.462 --> 07:45.840
I went by Ted's office today.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.717
You found him?

07:47.800 --> 07:50.011
{\an3}Yeah, I found him, after
a few phone calls.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.262
Say, 50 or so.

07:51.345 --> 07:55.558
I found out that Ted's company
merged with Whittier &amp; Leeks.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.351
So I went down
to those offices today.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.854
Didn't even get past the lobby
before I found this.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.230
Corporate newsletter.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.232
Yes. This is Ted himself.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.400
Recently promoted.

08:04.483 --> 08:07.069
Is he Barbie's dream date,

08:07.153 --> 08:09.572
{\an3}or what?

08:09.655 --> 08:11.741
Well, maybe right for Barbie,
not right for Jill.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.034
{\an3}(sighs)

08:13.117 --> 08:15.578
They're soul mates already. Wait
till she sees him in the flesh.

08:16.829 --> 08:17.997
So what's on your agenda?

08:20.666 --> 08:22.752
Maybe not the best day for this,

08:22.835 --> 08:25.254
{\an1}but, uh...

08:25.338 --> 08:27.715
I've got a job interview
at the <i> Chronicle.</i>

08:32.220 --> 08:36.432
(rock music playing)

08:36.515 --> 08:38.058
What if they're happy?

08:38.142 --> 08:39.727
I mean, they are our parents.

08:39.809 --> 08:42.772
It's a nightmare. It's a
train wreck waiting to happen.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.941
Oh, I don't know.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.318
Where'd you get that?

08:49.528 --> 08:51.364
This? My mother.

08:52.573 --> 08:53.616
Your father?

08:53.699 --> 08:55.117
Mm-hmm.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.410
What's next?

08:57.578 --> 08:59.288
Twin sweater-sets?
Forced sleep-away camp?

08:59.372 --> 09:01.332
All right,
you've covered the options.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.959
{\an3}What's the plan?
Okay.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.293
I'm gonna talk
to your dad, but my mom

09:04.377 --> 09:05.336
is completely deaf to me.

09:05.419 --> 09:07.255
Luckily, she's going
to be eager to please you.

09:07.338 --> 09:07.964
Me?

09:08.047 --> 09:09.048
Yeah. Hit her low.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.341
Hit her really hard
with the truth about your dad.

09:10.424 --> 09:13.970
Well, when you say it like that,
it makes me want to defend him.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.472
Look, this is no time
for family pride or loyalty.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.307
{\an3}I mean, do you want to be
sharing holidays

09:18.391 --> 09:20.101
and birthdays and-and matching
outfits with me

09:20.184 --> 09:21.435
for the rest of your life?

09:28.025 --> 09:29.610
(knocking at door)

09:32.280 --> 09:33.281
Hi.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.824
You said you had Ted's address.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.743
His office, actually.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.162
You could invite me in.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.497
Oh, I did.

09:41.580 --> 09:44.083
When I thought you
were someone I knew.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.501
Someone I loved.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.503
Someone I nearly made love with.

09:47.586 --> 09:51.173
Jill, I know you don't know me,

09:51.257 --> 09:53.009
but I know you.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.302
Your letters...

09:54.385 --> 09:55.511
Were addressed to Ted.

09:55.594 --> 09:56.971
Did I mention

09:57.054 --> 09:58.931
by opening them,
you committed a crime?

10:01.434 --> 10:03.394
Come on, just give me a chance.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.356
Ted's phone number.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.191
The name of his company.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.359
Anything.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.694
Did you ever wonder why

10:11.777 --> 10:13.362
he never came looking for you?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.363
No.

10:15.781 --> 10:19.160
I'm sure he thinks I just
stopped writing to him.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.494
I'd have found you.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.789
Come on, give me a chance.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.335
Go out with me as me.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.836
Steve Sanders.

10:28.919 --> 10:31.380
And then if you can resist my
overwhelming charm,

10:31.464 --> 10:33.674
my animal magnetism and

10:33.758 --> 10:35.217
charismatic personality,

10:35.301 --> 10:37.053
then I'll give you Ted.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.554
This is blackmail.

10:38.637 --> 10:40.598
Yeah, I guess.

10:40.681 --> 10:43.559
But it's for a good cause.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.605
One date.

10:49.023 --> 10:52.193
Steve Sanders.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.572
{\an5}BRANDON:
<i>All right,</i>
<i>so, tell me the truth.</i>

10:56.655 --> 10:58.574
{\an3}Have you ever got to
say "Stop the presses"?

10:58.657 --> 11:00.868
(chuckles)

11:00.951 --> 11:02.411
{\an1}I read your previous
submissions.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.454
They were really good.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.247
{\an3}But your work this
year is great.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.916
Thanks.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.710
How did you, um,
come across it?

11:09.794 --> 11:11.796
{\an1}I keep an eye
on the smaller papers.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.632
{\an1}It's my job to steal
the next Bob Woodward.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.592
{\an3}I should be
so lucky.

11:18.552 --> 11:22.098
{\an1}I'm afraid there's
no room for negotiation.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.266
We know what a job here
can do for your career later.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.727
Working for a big city daily,

11:26.811 --> 11:28.771
it's, uh, it's kind of
a dream of mine.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.108
Here's a temporary ID.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.902
{\an1}Come by tomorrow
after lunch,

11:34.985 --> 11:35.986
and we'll get you started.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.447
That's it?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.449
Unless you want me
to reconsider.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.451
That's okay.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.204
{\an3}Thanks.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.373
Ms. Stanley.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.251
Uh, right-- Jamie.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.752
{\an3}Uh, I finished up
at Personnel.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.254
I just wanted to
say thanks again.

11:53.337 --> 11:54.255
Brian Carter,

11:54.338 --> 11:55.131
this is Brandon Walsh,

11:55.214 --> 11:56.132
our new Metro reporter.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.300
{\an4}Oh, you just
starting up?
Yeah, yeah. You, too?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.136
{\an3}Yeah. Hey, if you're
all finished here,

12:00.219 --> 12:01.137
I'll walk you out.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.471
We can go grab a
beer, celebrate.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.472
Great, sounds good.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.473
Thanks again.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.308
Sure.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.185
{\an3}Get a nice
cold one.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.311
Yeah.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.439
Did you, uh, get a chance
to look around this place?

12:11.522 --> 12:12.481
A little bit, yeah.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.150
You boys just get jobs?

12:14.233 --> 12:15.484
{\an3}Yeah, I'm
Brandon Walsh.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.445
{\an1}Uh, Brian Carter.
Timmy McCourt.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.488
I've seen your byline
on hundreds of stories.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.489
It's an honor.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.490
Thank you.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.658
Jamie bring you up to speed?

12:22.741 --> 12:24.493
Yeah, yeah, briefly.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.953
{\an3}Listen, I know
you're busy,

12:26.036 --> 12:27.204
but if you got a couple
of minutes

12:27.288 --> 12:28.497
tomorrow and could
show us the ropes,

12:28.581 --> 12:29.832
it'd be greatly appreciated.

12:29.915 --> 12:30.833
I'm afraid I'll be on

12:30.916 --> 12:32.126
the other side of those ropes

12:32.209 --> 12:33.335
tomorrow, kid.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.005
The real reporters
are going on strike.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.507
The real reporters?

12:38.591 --> 12:41.469
You guys are scabs.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.360
{\an1}Hey.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.362
Hmm?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.031
(chuckles)

13:02.114 --> 13:03.532
(groans)

13:03.616 --> 13:06.160
{\an3}I was up all night
thinking of those dresses,

13:06.243 --> 13:07.703
doubting all the
choices I made.

13:07.786 --> 13:10.164
Well, now you got Sally
what's-her-name on the phone.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.458
The buyer from MayaLee's?

13:13.459 --> 13:14.710
Oh, great.

13:14.793 --> 13:15.794
She's probably calling
to tell me

13:15.878 --> 13:18.297
they shipped all my dresses off
to a discount store.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.256
{\an1}(chuckles)

13:19.340 --> 13:21.258
Okay, ready for this.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.468
Hello.

13:22.551 --> 13:25.262
Yes, this is Donna.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.263
What?!

13:26.347 --> 13:28.224
Are you kidding?

13:28.307 --> 13:29.225
All of them?

13:29.308 --> 13:30.601
Oh, my God.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.061
Uh, sorry.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.562
Y-Yes, sure.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.856
Um, okay, I'll need,
um, two weeks

13:35.940 --> 13:38.067
for production.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.068
(chuckles):
Okay.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.277
Um, thank you.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.278
Thank you so much.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.071
Bye.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.906
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
(chuckles)

13:43.989 --> 13:45.533
They sold, they sold.
Every single dress sold.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.159
Now they want to buy 20 more.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.285
{\an3}We did it.
You did it.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.913
I can't believe this.

13:50.996 --> 13:51.956
Wow.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.165
{\an3}Okay.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.583
Um, I'm going to pay you back

13:54.667 --> 13:55.751
all the money you gave me.

13:55.834 --> 13:56.919
There's no rush.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.420
Or we could take the money

13:58.504 --> 14:00.589
and we could open a shop,
just like you said.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.133
Why don't we take
one step at a time?

14:03.217 --> 14:04.343
You don't think it'll work?

14:04.426 --> 14:06.136
I think you're taking on
a lot right now.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.305
{\an1}You're letting it count
for way too much.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.266
Now, your dresses sold,
but if they hadn't,

14:10.349 --> 14:12.768
you'd be just as talented,
just as good.

14:12.851 --> 14:15.312
You have that much faith in me?

14:15.396 --> 14:16.230
Yeah, I do.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.440
That means everything to me.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.525
Thank you.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.780
(chuckles)

14:24.863 --> 14:26.115
{\an1}So they're taking
these reporters' articles

14:26.198 --> 14:27.283
and putting them online?

14:27.366 --> 14:28.117
{\an3}Right, and they're
not paying them

14:28.200 --> 14:30.119
{\an3}any more for it, and
that's their beef.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.579
Well, good morning, Janet.

14:31.662 --> 14:32.580
{\an3}Hi, guys.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.622
Bagels are on the counter.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.957
Your suit from the dry cleaners

14:35.040 --> 14:36.292
is on your desk.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.960
Oh, and here's a little reminder

14:38.043 --> 14:40.421
of the rules
of the road.

14:40.504 --> 14:41.463
Hmm.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.299
{\an1}This parking ticket
is for your car.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.509
Yeah, I was double parked,
picking up your dry cleaning

14:45.593 --> 14:46.844
{\an3}five minutes
before the place

14:46.927 --> 14:48.304
closed last night.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.764
Couldn't go this morning?

14:50.848 --> 14:52.433
No, I couldn't
because I was busy.

14:52.516 --> 14:55.644
And you said you needed
your suit for a meeting tonight.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.441
{\an3}Meeting?

15:00.524 --> 15:02.151
Well, not really a meeting.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.028
It's more like a... date.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.321
Date with Jill?

15:05.404 --> 15:06.322
Yes, yes.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.323
Date with Jill.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.116
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.328
Janet, if you mind doing

15:12.411 --> 15:14.121
{\an4}these personal favors,
just say so.
(blows nose)

15:14.204 --> 15:15.497
{\an3}I think that's
what she's saying.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.374
{\an1}Don't you have to get to work,
someplace else?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.335
You got the job
at the <i> Chronicle?</i>

15:19.418 --> 15:21.003
Yeah, dig out the resumes.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.338
{\an1}We're gonna need
a new editor.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.672
{\an3}Look, look, look, look,
I'll double back here

15:23.756 --> 15:24.673
{\an3}until you find
somebody.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.175
It's no big deal.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.176
Oh, no, you won't.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.344
This is the big-time, Brandon.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.846
You're not gonna screw it up
by trying to do two jobs,

15:30.929 --> 15:32.306
not even for your best friend,
your partner,

15:32.389 --> 15:33.390
{\an1}the guy
who discovered you.

15:33.474 --> 15:34.892
Okay, I get the picture.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.020
So why do they need you so soon?

15:39.605 --> 15:41.482
The, uh...
(clears throat)

15:41.565 --> 15:43.317
the reporters
went on strike this morning.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.237
Oh, so, um...

15:47.321 --> 15:51.283
you didn't actually get the job,
you took someone's.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.035
Someone who left on

15:53.118 --> 15:54.328
a matter of principle?

15:54.411 --> 15:55.204
When I got the offer,

15:55.287 --> 15:57.081
I didn't know
they were gonna strike.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.540
Well, you know now.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.377
I've waited a long time
for a job like this.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.753
And this is
how you want to get it?

16:02.836 --> 16:05.339
You know what?

16:05.422 --> 16:07.174
No one's starving
at the <i> Chronicle,</i>

16:07.257 --> 16:08.592
{\an1}no one's
breathing coal dust.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.719
This union thing's
a thing of the past.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.846
So's this break,
if I don't take it.

16:12.930 --> 16:13.722
Well, take it.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.890
Don't.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.061
VALERIE:
<i>She has a little cash</i>

16:19.144 --> 16:20.062
from the sale of a house.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.230
You can do better.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.731
I don't want
your mother's money.

16:24.358 --> 16:27.736
Look, I, I know
I was a terrible husband

16:27.820 --> 16:30.280
and a worse father, and I'm sure
Kelly's told you about that.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.366
Enough.

16:32.449 --> 16:36.120
But I didn't appreciate what it
meant to come home to someone.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.287
Now I do.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.415
You're lonely.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.375
Find another sucker.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.543
{\an3}All right, I-I
was selfish

16:42.626 --> 16:44.378
but never lonely.

16:44.461 --> 16:47.131
Not until the first time I had
to say good-bye to your mother.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.258
Are you still selfish?

16:51.009 --> 16:53.804
Look, I don't want this,
and neither does Kelly.

16:53.887 --> 16:55.264
{\an1}I mean,
she's your daughter.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.265
Doesn't that matter?

16:56.348 --> 16:57.766
We'd like your blessing, Val.

16:57.850 --> 16:58.559
If you hurt her,

16:58.642 --> 17:01.478
if you so much as
disappoint her,

17:01.562 --> 17:03.230
I'll call your parole officer.

17:03.313 --> 17:04.189
I'll file false charges.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.150
{\an6}I'll do anything to...
What, to
protect her?

17:06.233 --> 17:07.693
So will I.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.409
When he was married
to my mother,

17:15.492 --> 17:18.619
he forgot birthdays,
anniversaries.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.582
{\an3}Finally, he
just forgot us.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.958
Your father loves you.

17:23.040 --> 17:26.377
Well, that's how he treats
the people he loves.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.796
(thunder rumbles softly)

17:27.880 --> 17:30.466
You think he's changed.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.925
I thought he had, too.

17:32.009 --> 17:32.801
Thought he'd finally realized

17:32.885 --> 17:34.970
what it was like
to be loved by someone.

17:35.053 --> 17:36.430
And now he finally has.

17:37.681 --> 17:40.142
You want me to have all this
information before I do this.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.477
But you know,

17:41.560 --> 17:44.521
you can never really
know someone completely.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.192
(thunder rumbles softly)

17:48.275 --> 17:49.485
Valerie's father...

17:49.568 --> 17:51.445
I know.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.324
You learn not to think about it,

17:55.407 --> 17:57.326
not to notice

17:57.409 --> 17:59.828
the silence.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.457
I'm good at shutting things out.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.293
{\an1}But I don't want
to shut your father out.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.295
He thinks we have
a chance together.

18:10.297 --> 18:13.842
I just think you should, um,
take a look at his history,

18:13.926 --> 18:15.469
his actions.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.971
That's all I'm saying.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.140
We're getting married,

18:20.224 --> 18:22.309
Saturday at St. Timothy's.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.144
(thunder rumbles softly)

18:24.228 --> 18:25.229
This Saturday?

18:26.271 --> 18:28.774
Great.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.240
(people chattering in distance)

18:36.323 --> 18:38.075
(thunder rumbles)

18:38.158 --> 18:39.368
Brandon, hey.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.702
Hey, Brian.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.079
{\an1}Lovely weather
we're having, huh?

18:42.162 --> 18:43.872
{\an3}(chuckles):
Yeah.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.041
So how many times you get
turned down by this newspaper?

18:46.125 --> 18:50.045
{\an1}Uh, once before I graduated
and then again last June.

18:50.128 --> 18:53.423
{\an1}Who'd you think was cooler,
Superman or Clark Kent?

18:53.507 --> 18:54.550
Jimmy Olson.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.634
Ace reporter.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.389
{\an1}What do you think
they want?

19:00.472 --> 19:01.390
{\an3}Money.

19:01.473 --> 19:02.266
It's always money.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.517
{\an6}BRANDON:
You know, it's
a union shop.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.060
{\an1}If we go in there
and work,

19:05.144 --> 19:06.061
we're scabs.

19:06.144 --> 19:07.729
That doesn't bother you?

19:07.813 --> 19:09.231
I got kids to feed.

19:09.314 --> 19:12.276
REPORTERS:
Scab! Scab! Scab!

19:33.005 --> 19:34.798
{\an3}It was a nice
restaurant.

19:36.466 --> 19:37.593
{\an1}Come on.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.052
They brought you
the wrong food,

19:39.136 --> 19:40.804
{\an1}the table wouldn't
stop jiggling

19:40.888 --> 19:43.307
no matter how many sugar packets
I stuffed under the legs,

19:43.390 --> 19:44.600
and that waiter was rude.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.685
You handled it like a pro.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.605
It's not what I had planned.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.523
That's okay.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.152
You're not who I thought
you were, and I still

19:55.235 --> 19:57.738
{\an3}felt...

19:57.821 --> 19:58.739
Yeah?

19:58.822 --> 20:02.117
...what I felt, anyway.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.953
But I am in love
with someone else.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.376
Someone you don't even know.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.422
Didn't you know me
from my letters?

20:18.425 --> 20:20.010
We're gonna need a pen.

20:21.845 --> 20:24.264
Whittier &amp; Leeks.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.308
{\an1}They're downtown
off Sixth.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.309
Make sure you ask for Ted

20:27.392 --> 20:29.603
in the International Department
specifically.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.480
He's new there, so

20:31.563 --> 20:34.191
he's not gonna be
on the directory.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.444
Aren't you gonna
write this down?

20:39.446 --> 20:42.324
I've wanted this for so long.

20:42.407 --> 20:46.119
{\an3}I flew all
the way here.

20:46.203 --> 20:50.082
If it doesn't feel right,
you don't have to do it.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.292
Okay.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.335
You do it.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.212
How am I supposed to do that?

20:55.295 --> 20:56.254
{\an3}You're very
inventive.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.881
Just get him there.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.717
I'll have to go through with it
if he's in the same room.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.011
(laughs)

21:03.095 --> 21:05.180
{\an1}Oh, boy.

21:05.263 --> 21:06.640
Okay.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.153
To you.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.239
For believing in me.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.208
{\an3}Mm, hey.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.918
{\an3}That's from
the store.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.878
{\an1}Why don't you
deal with it tomorrow?

21:36.962 --> 21:38.797
I just want to
see what it is.

21:43.301 --> 21:45.345
A check for the dresses.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.888
Oh, it's a mistake.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.181
{\an3}They already
paid us.

21:48.265 --> 21:48.974
I'll deal with it.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.392
You said it was
cash on delivery.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.895
Remember we went to
dinner to celebrate?

21:53.979 --> 21:55.605
Noah?

21:56.606 --> 21:58.066
(sighs)

21:58.150 --> 22:02.029
The money you got
for the dresses came from me.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.739
The store bought them
on consignment.

22:03.822 --> 22:08.869
So they pay us if
and when they sell the dresses.

22:08.952 --> 22:11.079
A store like MayaLee's?
No, they wouldn't do that.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.123
I got a friend in corporate.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.666
An old buddy of mine.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.838
So, you cut a deal
behind my back?

22:19.921 --> 22:21.923
Look, after the overdose
and getting fired,

22:22.007 --> 22:24.051
I wanted to help you.

22:25.343 --> 22:27.054
Help me what?

22:27.137 --> 22:29.222
Believe in yourself.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.099
Even though you don't?

22:50.160 --> 22:51.953
JANET:
<i>Yes, sir, we got your ad,</i>

22:52.037 --> 22:54.456
and we placed it according
to your specifications.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.833
{\an1}Okay, so you go into the guy's
office and what happens?

22:56.917 --> 22:58.126
Well, I tell him I'm
a potential investor.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.294
{\an1}You?

22:59.377 --> 23:00.587
Yeah, and, uh, we're meeting
in the restaurant tonight

23:00.670 --> 23:02.172
to review my portfolio.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.590
{\an1}Do you even
have a portfolio?

23:03.673 --> 23:05.300
Please. After tonight,
I won't even have a girl.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.094
{\an1}Hmm.
Did Jill call?

23:07.177 --> 23:08.970
Sir, I-I understand
that you're upset.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.847
Any messages for me?

23:10.931 --> 23:12.307
{\an1}Thank you.
Janet, you get bagels?

23:12.390 --> 23:14.184
{\an6}I... listen I will
recheck the order.
No bagels.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.311
{\an4}What are we gonna do
without bagels?
And I will
call you back, okay?

23:16.394 --> 23:17.479
{\an4}Bagels are brain food.
Poppy bagel,
my cup of coffee...

23:17.562 --> 23:19.106
{\an1}and a shmear...
You guys?

23:19.189 --> 23:20.649
{\an3}I happen to think
that I'm good

23:20.732 --> 23:23.193
at my job, but there is
only so much I can do.

23:23.276 --> 23:25.237
And especially
when I am swamped,

23:25.320 --> 23:26.988
sick and underpaid.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.658
Aren't you supposed
to be at work?

23:29.741 --> 23:32.619
I couldn't cross
the picket line.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.496
I'm glad.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.039
Yeah, selfishly, so am I.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.999
I hate to see you walk away
from something you want so bad.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.293
And for what? A union
that won't let you in

23:40.377 --> 23:41.670
{\an1}because its members
have a lock

23:41.753 --> 23:42.671
on all the jobs.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.339
Hi. I'm Donald Tucker.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.632
I'm looking for
Steve Sanders.

23:45.715 --> 23:47.175
Oh, I almost forgot. Donald.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.344
{\an1}I'm Steve.
This is Brandon Walsh.

23:49.427 --> 23:50.428
How you doing?

23:50.512 --> 23:53.014
Uh, he's here
for your job.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.016
Oh. I read your stuff, man.
Very impressive.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.726
{\an4}(sighs)
STEVE:
Uh,

23:56.810 --> 23:59.020
Donald, I'm sorry. The position
is no longer available.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.355
{\an1}BRANDON:
I thought I was

24:00.438 --> 24:01.815
going to
the <i> Chronicle,</i> but I'm not.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.358
(laughing)

24:03.442 --> 24:04.526
Sorry.

24:04.609 --> 24:05.694
{\an3}I-I laugh

24:05.777 --> 24:06.695
when I'm nervous.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.029
Like on job interviews.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.031
There is no more job.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.033
(laughing)

24:12.117 --> 24:13.201
{\an3}Sorry.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.494
Happens when I'm

24:14.578 --> 24:15.495
disappointed, too.

24:15.579 --> 24:16.496
Well, what happens

24:16.580 --> 24:18.206
when you meet a pretty woman?

24:18.290 --> 24:21.543
Well, I-I-I don't.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.087
Not like he means.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.088
You understand.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.048
(phone rings)
Sure.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.508
{\an1}<i>Beverly Beat.</i>
Look, I'm really

24:28.592 --> 24:30.343
sorry about the editor position.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.097
{\an4}JANET:
Um, Brandon,
it's a Brian

24:34.181 --> 24:35.182
Carter from the <i> Chronicle.</i>

24:39.144 --> 24:39.936
Yeah?

24:40.020 --> 24:42.230
{\an4}Uh-huh.
Maybe we can
use your services,

24:42.314 --> 24:44.065
{\an4}after all.
Yeah, what's
going on, Brian?

24:44.149 --> 24:45.984
Have you ever done
any undercover pieces?

24:46.067 --> 24:48.945
{\an1}You know, posing
as someone, say...

24:49.029 --> 24:51.907
{\an5}an investment banker named Ted?
Brian, I can't
hear you.

24:51.990 --> 24:55.202
{\an4}BRANDON:
Brian, speak up.
I can't hear you.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.078
BRIAN:
Hey, I'm on a story.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.247
A section of a state-funded
housing project collapsed.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.415
Was anyone hurt?

25:00.498 --> 25:01.875
No, but it's right on the heels

25:01.958 --> 25:02.918
of the board's safety approval.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.961
Hey, stay by the phone.
I'll feed you the facts.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.130
Brian, I didn't take the job.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.549
I haven't got time to do
the research and write it up.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.092
I don't think I can do that.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.093
Brandon,

25:12.177 --> 25:13.553
this is my first piece.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.096
I need to work
with a good writer.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.098
That'd be you.
I'll call you when I'm in.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.099
Yeah.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.894
(dial tone)

25:23.396 --> 25:24.814
DAVID:
<i>Come on, Val.</i>

25:24.898 --> 25:25.982
<i>The rehearsal starts at 4:00.</i>

25:26.066 --> 25:27.442
I'm not going.

25:27.525 --> 25:31.279
{\an3}Okay, your mom stole the
show on your birthday.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.948
All right, her
timing was bad.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.908
{\an3}I-I don't think
her motives were.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.827
Oh, David,
she doesn't listen to me.

25:37.911 --> 25:40.121
Bad news?
She doesn't want to hear it.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.499
If it gets in the way
of her having a man.

25:42.582 --> 25:46.795
No, it doesn't matter
how much he hurt me...

25:46.878 --> 25:48.922
coming into my room
night after night...

25:53.677 --> 25:55.679
This isn't
about Bill Taylor, is it?

25:55.762 --> 25:59.099
No, it's...

25:59.182 --> 26:01.226
It's not. It's...

26:03.395 --> 26:04.646
...my father.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.316
When I was a kid, he, uh...

26:12.195 --> 26:14.197
I was sexually abused, David.

26:15.782 --> 26:17.701
(sighs)

26:19.452 --> 26:22.163
I didn't know.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.999
Yeah, that's what she said
when I told her.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.042
{\an1}Well...
(laughs)

26:26.126 --> 26:27.836
You knew I was damaged.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.880
Turns out,
I'm completely broken.

26:33.925 --> 26:36.094
How old were you?

26:37.554 --> 26:39.264
Eleven.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.019
I became really quiet.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.895
Withdrawn.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.689
{\an1}Instead of asking me
what was wrong,

26:47.772 --> 26:50.859
my mom decides
to invite half the school over

26:50.942 --> 26:52.861
for my 12th birthday party.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.529
My dad, um...

26:54.612 --> 26:56.781
buys me this-this jacket.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.284
Black mink.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.411
{\an1}We didn't have
that kind of money.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.538
I thought everybody knew.

27:03.621 --> 27:05.415
It was guilt talking.

27:05.498 --> 27:07.834
Val, it was his fault.
It wasn't yours.

27:10.253 --> 27:12.255
My 13th birthday...

27:14.674 --> 27:17.010
There was this huge blizzard.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.222
My dad was in Chicago,

27:21.306 --> 27:24.142
and he was stuck there
because the airport was closed.

27:24.225 --> 27:28.021
{\an1}The snow was piled up
so high outside our house that

27:28.104 --> 27:30.106
nobody could get in or out.

27:33.443 --> 27:36.071
It was the first time
in a long time I felt safe.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.744
So my mom and I decide...

27:42.827 --> 27:44.746
to bake a cake.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.581
{\an1}It was...

27:46.664 --> 27:50.126
it was chocolate
with vanilla frosting.

27:51.711 --> 27:54.130
Nothing ever tasted so good.

27:59.135 --> 28:00.387
Noah?

28:00.470 --> 28:02.555
{\an1}Donna. Hey, look,
I'm kind of busy right now.

28:02.639 --> 28:03.807
I'll make it quick.

28:03.890 --> 28:05.767
{\an3}(thunder rumbles)
I'm sorry.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.852
{\an3}You made a shrewd
business move.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.270
{\an3}It just happened to
hurt my feelings.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.564
Look, I knew eventually
you'd sell your designs.

28:11.648 --> 28:12.774
With everything
you've been through,

28:12.857 --> 28:14.109
I didn't think you could wait.

28:14.192 --> 28:17.112
Well, my faith in myself,
it's pretty strong.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.947
It's my faith in men
that's been tested

28:19.030 --> 28:20.990
{\an3}this year--
to the limit.

28:23.368 --> 28:26.413
(picketers clamoring)

28:33.086 --> 28:34.421
Thanks for the ride, man.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.297
Yeah, sure. You know,
if you're freelancing,

28:36.381 --> 28:37.632
{\an3}you could have
e-mailed this here.

28:37.715 --> 28:38.842
Or worn a disguise.

28:38.925 --> 28:41.970
What are they striking for?
Ergonomically-designed seats?

28:42.053 --> 28:43.972
{\an3}Espresso machine in
the break room? What?

28:44.055 --> 28:45.515
Salary. Pension.

28:45.598 --> 28:46.516
Reprinting rights.

28:46.599 --> 28:47.725
What do you think?

28:47.809 --> 28:49.519
I think I'd be happy

28:49.602 --> 28:51.062
with what they're getting now.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.482
See ya.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.609
(thunder rumbles)

28:59.028 --> 29:02.115
That guy was here before.
Is he a reporter?

29:05.910 --> 29:07.454
You made the right
choice yesterday.

29:07.537 --> 29:09.956
{\an1}Scab!
Management stooge!

29:10.039 --> 29:11.666
You're taking
our jobs, scab.

29:11.749 --> 29:13.668
Tell Donald the job's open.

29:13.751 --> 29:15.003
{\an3}Yeah.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.212
(people shouting)

29:19.757 --> 29:20.842
ABBY:
There you are.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.469
Is that what you're wearing?

29:25.096 --> 29:27.640
Uh, Val is here to give you her
support. She could probably

29:27.724 --> 29:28.850
use yours as well.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.143
She's always had my support.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.812
You look lovely.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.981
Um, David, can you, uh...

29:35.064 --> 29:36.357
go talk to the minister?

29:36.441 --> 29:38.860
{\an1}He's supposed
to give me a reading.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.195
I'm okay here.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.238
{\an3}All right.

29:42.322 --> 29:46.159
Reverend Mayfair has an
appointment in 15 minutes.

29:46.242 --> 29:48.661
{\an1}I wonder if you wouldn't mind
standing in for your Dad.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.038
Okay. Did he call?

29:50.121 --> 29:51.206
Well, how could he?

29:51.289 --> 29:52.040
I've been running errands
all morning.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.334
All right,
I will check my machine.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.127
Maybe he called there.

29:57.921 --> 30:00.006
Bill told me about your visit.

30:00.089 --> 30:02.217
Mom, like I've said before,

30:02.300 --> 30:04.010
I don't think
you should marry him.

30:04.093 --> 30:05.220
{\an1}BILL:
Where's my

30:05.303 --> 30:06.888
bride?

30:06.971 --> 30:07.889
{\an1}Hi!

30:07.972 --> 30:09.724
(laughing)

30:09.807 --> 30:12.018
Dad, you're 45
minutes late.

30:12.101 --> 30:15.230
{\an1}I know, I know.
Darling, I am so sorry.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.065
{\an3}I had a meeting,
then traffic.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.066
I'm gonna get

30:18.149 --> 30:19.150
you a cell phone.

30:19.234 --> 30:22.195
I don't like being out
of touch with you. No, I don't.

30:22.278 --> 30:25.865
{\an3}Another brilliant
deflection by Bill Taylor.

30:25.949 --> 30:28.243
He's late and doesn't call,
and it's her fault for not

30:28.326 --> 30:29.577
having a cell phone.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.954
{\an1}Well, I'll give it to her
for a wedding present.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.497
David, how are you?

30:32.580 --> 30:35.583
Do I detect defeat?

30:35.667 --> 30:38.211
Maybe he's changed.

30:38.294 --> 30:41.130
VALERIE:
They do look good together.

30:41.214 --> 30:44.133
Yeah, they do.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.596
(indistinct conversations)

30:48.680 --> 30:51.933
(smooth jazz plays)

31:00.191 --> 31:02.068
Do you think Ted's here?

31:02.151 --> 31:03.278
I mean, how will we

31:03.361 --> 31:04.612
recognize each other?

31:10.827 --> 31:12.829
Uh, I've got it all worked out.

31:12.912 --> 31:14.622
I'm gonna use the phone.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.665
I'll be right back, okay?

31:15.748 --> 31:17.000
Okay.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.378
I'll just be a minute.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.968
{\an3}Ted Slafsky.
Nice to meet you.

31:27.051 --> 31:29.304
{\an3}I've read every financial
trade paper I could.

31:29.387 --> 31:30.722
That's great.

31:30.805 --> 31:32.140
The thing is, Donald...

31:32.223 --> 31:32.974
Ted.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.811
{\an1}We're not doing
a financial exposé here.

31:36.894 --> 31:40.189
See that girl over there?

31:40.273 --> 31:42.150
{\an5}Sitting alone on the
other side of the bar?
Mm-hmm.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.652
{\an1}Well that's Jill,
and I am absolutely

31:44.736 --> 31:47.947
{\an1}head over heels, arrow through
the heart crazy about her.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.866
Well that's good, I guess.

31:49.949 --> 31:52.160
No, Donald. It's not good.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.329
See that guy?

31:54.412 --> 31:56.497
Covered with waitresses?

31:56.581 --> 31:57.832
Mm-hmm.

31:57.915 --> 32:00.543
{\an1}That's Ted, and Jill's
in love with him.

32:00.627 --> 32:02.170
Whoa.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.464
That's right, Donald. Whoa.

32:04.547 --> 32:07.008
{\an1}But the thing of it is,
she's never met him in person.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.635
She's only read his letters.

32:08.718 --> 32:10.178
That is true love.

32:10.261 --> 32:11.346
Ah, is it?

32:11.429 --> 32:13.222
Because if she met someone

32:13.306 --> 32:15.141
{\an1}who she thought
wrote those letters,

32:15.224 --> 32:19.687
{\an1}someone, let's say,
with a little less...

32:19.771 --> 32:21.481
assuming presence...

32:21.564 --> 32:22.482
{\an1}Someone...

32:22.565 --> 32:23.650
Who looked like me.

32:23.733 --> 32:26.361
Would she still want him?

32:26.444 --> 32:28.196
So, it's a test.

32:28.279 --> 32:29.530
Yes, yes.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.200
{\an1}It's a test. A love test.
A test of true love.

32:32.283 --> 32:35.453
But you're changing all the
variables, not just looks.

32:35.536 --> 32:36.996
It's not a fair test.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.999
{\an3}You love this girl? You
want her to be happy?

32:41.292 --> 32:42.710
{\an1}Yeah.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.003
Even if it makes
you miserable?

32:44.087 --> 32:47.048
Because that's the
test of true love.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.012
You're right.

32:58.601 --> 33:00.812
I hope you're ready for
this, because I'm not.

33:06.150 --> 33:07.527
Ted...

33:07.610 --> 33:09.070
uh, you don't know me,

33:09.153 --> 33:10.446
but I set this meeting up.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.073
{\an3}Ted, this

33:12.156 --> 33:13.908
is your pen pal, Jill.

33:13.991 --> 33:15.618
Jill, this is Ted.

33:15.702 --> 33:16.911
Jill?

33:16.994 --> 33:19.122
Uh-huh. (chuckles) Hi.

33:19.205 --> 33:20.248
I'm Steve.

33:20.331 --> 33:21.249
You stopped writing.

33:21.332 --> 33:22.792
I thought I lost you.

33:24.210 --> 33:25.962
Steve Sanders.

33:37.473 --> 33:39.058
(knocking)

33:39.142 --> 33:40.059
Hey.
Hey.

33:40.143 --> 33:41.227
Um, can you take a break?

33:41.310 --> 33:42.437
{\an3}I want to show you
some sketches.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.938
Sure. Let's go downstairs.

33:44.021 --> 33:45.440
No, the bar's all sticky.
It'll ruin my sketches.

33:45.523 --> 33:46.482
Well, we'll get a table.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.151
It's so loud.

33:55.032 --> 33:56.617
What are you doing with these?

33:56.701 --> 33:58.077
I bought 'em.

33:58.161 --> 34:01.289
What?!
Is this all a joke to you?

34:01.372 --> 34:03.124
{\an1}They weren't selling.
They were

34:03.207 --> 34:04.584
in the store for one day!

34:04.667 --> 34:05.793
{\an3}I was gonna tell
you about it.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.211
When, after I caught you
in the first lie

34:07.295 --> 34:09.130
or now that I've caught you
in the second? Which?

34:09.213 --> 34:10.297
{\an1}If you listen to me...
No!

34:10.380 --> 34:12.132
I don't need to.

34:12.216 --> 34:14.177
I can see how little
you think of me.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.139
(door slams)

34:36.157 --> 34:37.449
Morning.

34:39.243 --> 34:42.330
{\an1}Mr. McCourt,
uh, good to see you.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.414
Thank you.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.208
{\an1}Janet Sosna,
this is...

34:45.291 --> 34:47.168
Timmy McCourt.
I'm a big fan.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.543
Thank you.
Pleasure to meet you.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.379
{\an1}What can I do
for you?

34:50.463 --> 34:51.880
How you doing?

34:51.964 --> 34:53.841
{\an1}Good.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.010
Saw your byline on

34:56.094 --> 34:57.345
the housing project story.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.055
It was a good piece.

34:59.138 --> 35:00.181
{\an3}Thanks.

35:01.599 --> 35:04.685
{\an3}I've got another
story for you:

35:04.769 --> 35:08.856
back in the 1930s,
guy meets gal.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.191
Love on the old assembly line,

35:10.274 --> 35:11.692
making a couple of bucks
an hour,

35:11.776 --> 35:13.361
but of course, you know,
you can double that

35:13.444 --> 35:14.362
because they're both working.

35:14.445 --> 35:15.571
And yet the kids,

35:15.655 --> 35:18.866
they kids are still growing up
in a house with dirt floors.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.243
Let me guess.

35:20.326 --> 35:22.495
No union, no benefits,
no overtime.

35:22.578 --> 35:23.830
{\an3}However,

35:23.913 --> 35:26.624
by the 1950's,
they are solidly middle class.

35:26.707 --> 35:28.042
And you know what?

35:28.125 --> 35:30.253
The youngest kid even goes
to college.

35:30.336 --> 35:32.213
American dream.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.506
You're looking at it.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.926
Take the story, don't take

35:37.009 --> 35:38.052
{\an3}the job.

35:38.135 --> 35:41.722
Mr. McCourt, I've waited
for an opportunity like this

35:41.806 --> 35:44.267
for a long time.
It doesn't come easy.

35:44.350 --> 35:46.102
Neither does what
we're fighting for.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.360
(knocking)

35:58.823 --> 36:00.408
Hi.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.785
{\an3}Dad, you're not dressed.
Where's your suit?

36:02.869 --> 36:06.122
{\an1}At the, uh, cleaner's,
I suppose.

36:06.205 --> 36:07.790
Don't do this.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.542
Please don't do this.

36:09.625 --> 36:12.336
{\an1}I thought you didn't want us
to get married.

36:12.420 --> 36:15.882
Believe me, Valerie's the last
person I want as family,

36:15.965 --> 36:17.717
but it would have been worth it

36:17.800 --> 36:19.552
if it'd meant
you could've kept a promise.

36:19.635 --> 36:22.138
You were so sure I wouldn't.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.765
(sighs)
Why did you even propose to her?

36:24.849 --> 36:26.559
It was the way she looked at me.

36:26.642 --> 36:29.103
I, I saw a second chance.

36:29.186 --> 36:30.438
She believed in you,

36:30.521 --> 36:32.231
even though she knew
she shouldn't.

36:32.315 --> 36:35.067
I know the feeling. Never again.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.611
Kelly, it's...

36:36.694 --> 36:38.487
Never again, Dad!

36:40.239 --> 36:41.532
(sighs)

36:46.913 --> 36:50.416
Just, um,
just explain it to her, hmm?

36:50.499 --> 36:53.961
How, when I don't understand?

36:54.045 --> 36:55.212
Yes, you do.

36:57.298 --> 37:01.385
We both wish
you were wrong about me.

37:08.184 --> 37:10.811
(bell tolling)

37:10.895 --> 37:12.813
(organ playing)

37:12.897 --> 37:14.941
(indistinct conversations)

37:19.946 --> 37:21.405
Got a minute?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.376
Listen to me.

37:33.459 --> 37:36.170
When you overdosed, I mean,
you were just laying there.

37:36.253 --> 37:38.089
{\an3}And I was helpless.
I couldn't help you at all.

37:38.172 --> 37:40.132
I just couldn't stand
to see you that way again.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.010
I'll make you a deal.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.179
{\an1}Next time
I have a problem,

37:45.262 --> 37:46.639
I won't go
for the medicine cabinet

37:46.722 --> 37:48.140
if you won't go for your wallet.

37:48.224 --> 37:51.227
{\an1}When I get scared,
and I lean on you...

37:51.310 --> 37:53.813
support me, don't lie to me.

37:53.896 --> 37:55.648
Okay.

37:55.731 --> 37:57.900
Okay.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.485
By the way, Burnett's department
store called.

37:59.568 --> 38:01.946
Oh... the head buyer wouldn't
even meet with me,

38:02.029 --> 38:03.406
so I dropped off a sample.

38:03.489 --> 38:04.532
They probably just want me

38:04.615 --> 38:05.533
to come and get it.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.076
Not unless you
can be in Madrid.

38:07.159 --> 38:09.704
That's where she is
on vacation, wearing it.

38:09.787 --> 38:12.039
{\an3}Yeah.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.708
She wants
a hundred more to sell.

38:15.668 --> 38:18.045
There any side deals,
sales incentives,

38:18.129 --> 38:20.381
favors for an old friend
I should know about here?

38:20.464 --> 38:22.550
Nope, this is all you.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.427
(giggles)

38:29.140 --> 38:30.391
{\an4}STEVE:
Is this the tie
you chose?

38:30.474 --> 38:31.892
BRANDON: What do you
mean, "Is this...?"

38:31.976 --> 38:33.561
Would you ever wear
a tie this stylish?

38:33.644 --> 38:36.063
{\an1}Look at that tie
you have on.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.064
What'd I get her?

38:37.148 --> 38:39.066
{\an3}A toaster.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.944
{\an3}It's a serving piece.
They'll love it.

38:42.028 --> 38:44.238
{\an1}You have Janet buying your
wedding presents now?

38:44.321 --> 38:46.741
Do you see how badly
I need a girlfriend?

38:46.824 --> 38:47.742
Oh...

38:47.825 --> 38:50.244
{\an3}Ted and Jill are probably
married right now.

38:50.327 --> 38:53.080
You did the right thing.
Feels good, doesn't it?

38:53.164 --> 38:54.874
{\an3}Mildly.

38:54.957 --> 38:56.709
{\an1}So, how's the new editor
working out?

38:56.792 --> 38:58.753
{\an1}STEVE:
Oh, took him for a,

38:58.836 --> 39:00.087
a get-to-know you drink.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.422
{\an1}Mm-hmm.
He got to know me.

39:01.505 --> 39:02.798
Passed on the job.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.091
Can't say I blame him.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.428
{\an1}I'm not going
to work at the <i> Chronicle.</i>

39:07.511 --> 39:09.764
{\an4}STEVE:
Shouldn't one of us be
disappointed?

39:09.847 --> 39:11.098
Best job I never had.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.308
{\an1}I'm really proud
of the work

39:12.391 --> 39:13.434
I didn't do there.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.271
Coming back
to the <i> Beat?</i>

39:17.355 --> 39:20.649
Throw in a medical plan,
sick days, paid overtime,

39:20.733 --> 39:21.734
I'll think about it.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.819
{\an3}(sighs)

39:26.697 --> 39:29.950
Mm... all right, all right.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.368
Aw, geez.

39:31.452 --> 39:32.870
Welcome back.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.625
(footsteps approaching)

39:41.003 --> 39:42.129
Hey.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.340
Oh, thank goodness.
Now we can get started.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.636
{\an3}Mom, wait.
Um, where is he?

39:48.719 --> 39:50.596
He's not coming.

39:52.848 --> 39:53.641
Abby, I'm so sorry.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.476
Well, he, he's late.

39:55.559 --> 39:56.477
He'll be here.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.521
I don't think so.

40:02.566 --> 40:05.277
He's nervous.
I'll, I'll talk to him.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.656
We'll work it out.

40:08.739 --> 40:09.615
What happened?

40:09.698 --> 40:11.784
I mean, he can't do this.
What did he say?

40:13.244 --> 40:14.829
What difference does it make?

40:15.955 --> 40:18.082
He's not coming.

40:24.296 --> 40:27.800
I'll, um, go tell the guests.

40:32.763 --> 40:33.681
Mom?

40:33.764 --> 40:34.890
{\an1}Mom, wait.

40:34.974 --> 40:37.685
It's all right, I'm fine.

40:37.768 --> 40:40.020
It doesn't matter.

40:40.104 --> 40:43.399
It was just a lark; crazy.

40:43.482 --> 40:45.192
I didn't think that...

40:45.276 --> 40:47.403
Mom, don't do this, okay?

40:47.486 --> 40:50.656
{\an1}Don't pretend
this isn't happening.

40:50.739 --> 40:53.534
God, take it from me.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.911
{\an1}If people don't know
you're hurt,

40:55.995 --> 40:59.790
{\an1}they don't know
to help you.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.752
{\an1}(sobbing):
Oh, honey!

41:03.836 --> 41:05.588
I'm so sorry.

41:10.176 --> 41:12.386
{\an5}BRANDON:
<i>You did very well</i>
<i>at the church today.</i>

41:12.469 --> 41:14.763
{\an3}It was good having
Valerie there

41:14.847 --> 41:16.640
{\an3}equally invested,
sort of like family.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.726
Your worst nightmare.

41:18.809 --> 41:21.228
{\an3}Once I got used to it,
it wasn't that bad.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.230
No, no, leave it.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.273
I like it.

41:24.356 --> 41:26.066
{\an1}All right.

41:32.823 --> 41:35.576
That's my ID tag
from the <i> Chronicle.</i>

41:35.659 --> 41:37.745
I won't be needing that
anytime soon.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.330
Can I have it?

41:39.413 --> 41:40.581
Why?

41:40.664 --> 41:43.125
A reminder:

41:43.209 --> 41:45.794
I have one good man in my life
who makes hard decisions,

41:45.878 --> 41:47.588
stands by them.

41:48.797 --> 41:50.549
(doorbell rings)

41:50.633 --> 41:52.051
I got it.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.766
Did you come to say good-bye?

41:58.849 --> 42:00.684
To thank you.

42:09.985 --> 42:11.278
Well, invite me to the wedding.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.280
I won't come,

42:13.364 --> 42:15.241
but I'll send you a gift.

42:15.324 --> 42:16.283
I already picked one out.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.286
We <i> did</i> talk about marriage.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.997
Did I mention
my low threshold for pain?

42:22.081 --> 42:26.293
But mostly I talked about you.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.921
{\an3}About all the things
you did to get to know me

42:29.004 --> 42:32.549
and what you did last night...

42:32.633 --> 42:33.801
for me.

42:39.181 --> 42:40.474
What about Ted?

42:40.557 --> 42:43.894
He was everything
I thought he'd be.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.524
But you're more.

42:59.827 --> 43:00.786
Hi.
Hey.

43:00.869 --> 43:04.290
Is, uh, your mom
on her way home?

43:04.373 --> 43:06.834
{\an1}Yeah, she hugged me
so tightly

43:06.917 --> 43:08.335
when she said good-bye.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.504
She's never done that.

43:10.587 --> 43:12.965
Well, she loves you.

43:13.048 --> 43:14.675
{\an1}I forget that
sometimes.

43:14.758 --> 43:18.679
Along with all
the happy memories.

43:18.762 --> 43:21.390
My father took those with him.

43:21.473 --> 43:23.475
Well, they're yours.
Sometimes you just need someone

43:23.559 --> 43:24.643
to help you reach them.

43:38.782 --> 43:39.825
(gasps softly)

43:42.828 --> 43:47.708
It's chocolate
on the inside.

43:47.791 --> 43:48.792
That's vanilla frosting.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.755
You made this?

43:53.464 --> 43:57.343
Happy Birthday.

43:57.426 --> 43:58.802
{\an1}Thanks.
