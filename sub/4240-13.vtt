11:02.412 --> 11:04.413
I'm so sorry.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.375
I fully understand
if you want to beat me up.

11:09.961 --> 11:13.339
If you can, just try
and avoid my nose.
Right.

11:13.423 --> 11:16.884
I'm not mad at you.

11:16.968 --> 11:21.180
All you did is what
I wasn't brave enough
to do-

11:21.264 --> 11:23.223

11:25.101 --> 11:30.522
I— I was selfish
when I told him.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.609
I wanted to break you two up
so he would want to be with me.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.280
And now neither of us
have him.

11:39.741 --> 11:43.118

so many people.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.793

12:14.442 --> 12:16.360
But I want to be with you,

12:16.444 --> 12:19.655
and I'm gonna
do everything I can
to be a good dad to our baby.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.242
Thanks.

12:23.326 --> 12:26.245
But I honestly
can't handle...

12:26.329 --> 12:28.872
any more stress
in my life right now.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.920
I'm gonna do this
on my own.

I get terrible

You know what, Jacob,
it's okay.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.925
We just need a 12th member.
All right? So, um,
just sway in the back.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.344
You don't even have to sing.
Yeah. Don't even sing.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.596

from Finn?

Hardly.
This is good news.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.377
My extensive auditioning
for community theater
has taught me...

14:38.461 --> 14:40.629
that we either
want to go first or last.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.131
If we’re first, then everyone
has to measure up to us.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.634
And if we’re last,
then we're the freshest
in the judges' minds.

You leaked the set list,
and you are not going
to get away with it.

accusation,

that they can win without you.

Why does it always have
to come down to me?

to be the bigger man?

to the white guy

You should be ashamed.
Aren't you ashamed?
You're educators.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.897
Actually, no.
You know what?
You're more than that.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.608
You take care
of disadvantaged kids,
and you're teaching them...

19:53.693 --> 19:55.902
that the only way
they can compete in this world
is by cheating.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.904
I'm sorry, but what kind
of message is that?

19:57.989 --> 19:59.906
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:59.991 --> 20:03.243

is the most downloaded song
in the history of iTunes.

how much winnin' is
gonna mean to my girls?

It's gonna be
a life changer-

worth something again.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.761
I'm-I'm sorry. Do you think
that they're not gonna know
that something's up?

20:21.846 --> 20:23.763
The fact that you just
magically came up...

20:23.848 --> 20:26.182
with two brand-new numbers
days before competition?

20:27.768 --> 20:29.895
They were great up there.
That's all I know.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.564
I think what we
have here is a case
of deaf racism.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.941
Shame on you.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.943
No, you know what
the real shame is?

20:37.028 --> 20:39.696
It's that maybe if
you believed in them
just a little bit more,

20:39.780 --> 20:42.282
they would have been
amazing up there,

20:42.366 --> 20:44.534

Mercedes, do you have anything
else in your repertoire?

- Yeah, but it's not as good
as anything you're gonna sing.
- No. We agreed-

We agreed that I would sing
"And I'm Telling You,"
and that ain't happening.

you're the best singer

belt it on the fly,
it should be her.

22:30.057 --> 22:33.518
Well, I do have something
that I've been working on
since I was four.

22:33.602 --> 22:36.730
Then I guess we have
our ballad, and we can close
with "Somebody to Love."

22:36.856 --> 22:40.358
It's a real crowd-pleaser.
Yeah. That and a can of soup
will guarantee us third place.

22:40.443 --> 22:43.445
We still need another song

is that we believe in ourselves,

but now you have gone
too far.

38:27.430 --> 38:31.016
You have embarrassed yourself
and besmirched the name
of William McKinley.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.477
A failed president!
Oh, please.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.479
The greatest one
who ever lived.

38:35.563 --> 38:38.732
You are suspended
from the school,
as of today.

38:40.568 --> 38:43.028
Schue, you have
anything to add?

38:44.656 --> 38:46.865
- I think you said it all.
- My word is official.

38:48.243 --> 38:50.202
Let it be written.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.914
Okay, if this is the way
you wanna play it.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.917
Okay.

39:01.798 --> 39:04.842
Schue. In light of
Sue's interference,

39:04.926 --> 39:07.052
I am reinstating you
as coach of
the Glee Club.

39:07.137 --> 39:10.347
I contacted the Ohio
Show Choir Governing Board...

39:10.432 --> 39:12.391
and set the record
straight.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.560
Thank you, sir.

39:14.644 --> 39:17.271
My pleasure.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.441
All right.
Good job.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.284
[Sue]
Schuester.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.459
Well played, sir.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.628
I underestimated you.

39:43.089 --> 39:45.674
All right, here's
what happens now.

39:45.759 --> 39:48.010
I'm gonna head on down
to my condo in Boca,

39:48.094 --> 39:51.096
brown up a bit,
get myself back
into fighting shape,

39:51.181 --> 39:54.892
then I'm gonna return
to this school even more
hell-bent on your destruction.

39:54.976 --> 39:57.186
Get ready for the ride
of your life, Will Schuester.

39:57.270 --> 40:00.939
You are about to board
the Sue Sylvester Express.

40:01.024 --> 40:03.817
Destination: horror.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.028
I look forward to it, Sue.

40:06.112 --> 40:08.655
You know, you just woke
a sleeping giant.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.326
Prepare to be crushed.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.833
[Sighs]

40:22.128 --> 40:25.172
Well, we have a few things
we'd like to show you,
Mr. Schue.

40:28.218 --> 40:31.303
First—

40:31.387 --> 40:33.972
- [Together]
Ta-da!

40:39.521 --> 40:44.608
Ohh. I am so proud
of you guys.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.276
You won fair and square.

40:46.361 --> 40:48.946
The result was unanimous,
and the judges
didn't even know...

40:49.030 --> 40:51.865
about all the shenanigans
that were going on
behind the scenes.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.868
So congratulations.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.829
You earned this.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.039
Yeah!
Yeah! Give it up.
Come on.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.291
All right.

41:01.376 --> 41:03.377
But...

41:04.712 --> 41:08.423
now we have regionals
to worry about,
and you can bet...

41:08.508 --> 41:11.593
that Vocal Adrenaline
is hard at work,
so we should be too.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.929
So- Let's get started.

41:14.013 --> 41:17.141
Uh, wait, Mr. Schue.
There's one more thing.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.685
Since you weren't able
to be there to see us perform,

41:19.769 --> 41:23.021
we put together
a special number
just for you.
