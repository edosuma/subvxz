-Very serendipitous.
-Agreed.

25:52.671 --> 25:54.613
Maybe Constance doesn't want
to talk shop right now.

25:54.713 --> 25:55.934
[Constance]
Oh, no, no, no. It's fine.

25:56.034 --> 25:58.817
Entrepreneurs proposition me
everywhere I go.

25:58.917 --> 26:00.939
It's the perils of being
a wealthy widow.

26:01.039 --> 26:03.542
[chuckles] I can only imagine.

26:03.642 --> 26:05.223
Well, like I was saying
over tea,

26:05.323 --> 26:07.626
with your backing financially
and my know-how,

26:07.726 --> 26:09.267
we could turn Minx
into so much more

26:09.367 --> 26:10.869
than just a magazine.

26:10.969 --> 26:12.711
I mean, just picture this--
uh, merchandising,

26:12.811 --> 26:15.273
uh, uh, uh, events,
international editions,

26:15.373 --> 26:17.115
taking this thing global.

26:17.215 --> 26:18.997
Think about the money
for a second.

26:19.097 --> 26:22.240
And all of this, it's not me.

26:22.340 --> 26:23.642
It's her.

26:23.742 --> 26:25.443
It's all made possible

26:25.543 --> 26:28.286
by our brilliant
editorial leadership

26:28.386 --> 26:30.849
from this lady right here,
Ms. Joyce Prigger.

26:30.949 --> 26:32.951
Joyce?

26:34.512 --> 26:36.134
Constance,
could I talk to you alone?

26:36.234 --> 26:37.455
Well, I don't--
I don't think that's necessary.

26:37.555 --> 26:39.017
-I think we could just--
-No, no.

26:39.117 --> 26:40.438
Why don't you be a lamb
and take our babies for a spin?

26:40.518 --> 26:42.140
-[Doug scoffs]
-They look like they have

26:42.240 --> 26:43.982
some business to attend to
as well.

26:44.082 --> 26:45.544
Well, it looks to me
they're so comfortable--

26:45.644 --> 26:47.225
Thank you.

26:47.325 --> 26:49.027
[Doug whistles]

26:49.127 --> 26:50.629
All right, you have
until they ring the gong

26:50.729 --> 26:52.831
for the grand promenade.

26:52.931 --> 26:55.714
But know this--
I don't invest in businesses.

26:55.814 --> 26:58.156
I invest in people.

26:58.256 --> 27:00.158
So why should I invest in you?

27:00.258 --> 27:01.560
Go.

27:01.660 --> 27:03.922
Well, it isn't just me.

27:04.022 --> 27:05.924
It's my whole team.

27:06.024 --> 27:08.406
And...

27:08.506 --> 27:10.649
we're outsiders like you.

27:10.749 --> 27:12.731
We had to blaze our own trail.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.292
And I don't want
to stop doing that

27:14.392 --> 27:16.975
just because Condé Nast is
panting at the door, you know?

27:17.075 --> 27:18.977
I want to keep doing it
our way.

27:19.077 --> 27:20.378
I want to--

27:20.478 --> 27:23.421
I want to keep fighting
with a woman at the helm,

27:23.521 --> 27:26.985
who not only understands it
but who has actually lived it.

27:27.085 --> 27:28.947
But I lost my fight.

27:29.047 --> 27:31.870
And they took my company,
and then they tried to kill me.

27:31.970 --> 27:34.192
Well, this time
you wouldn't be alone.

27:34.292 --> 27:36.234
And I promise
that I won't kill you.

27:36.334 --> 27:39.037
[chuckles]

27:39.137 --> 27:42.480
Ever since he put
this idea in my head,

27:42.580 --> 27:45.463
I cannot imagine
anyone else publishing Minx.

27:47.185 --> 27:50.208
Well,
I have always been tickled

27:50.308 --> 27:52.310
by the taboo.

27:55.273 --> 27:56.534
All right.

27:56.634 --> 27:58.536
Maybe I have
one good chapter left

27:58.636 --> 27:59.938
before I call it a career.

28:00.038 --> 28:01.660
Oh, my God.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.461
-[laughing] Really?
-Yes.

28:03.561 --> 28:05.383
Oh, my God, this is incredible!

28:05.483 --> 28:06.665
Oh, my God.

28:06.765 --> 28:09.107
I cannot believe he was right.

28:09.207 --> 28:10.749
Yes, he was.

28:10.849 --> 28:12.110
Quite the charmer, isn't he?

28:12.210 --> 28:13.111
Well...

28:13.211 --> 28:15.193
Yeah, but do we need him?

28:15.293 --> 28:17.595
Look, the man clearly stole
that dog,

28:17.695 --> 28:20.538
and that kind of bravado
is very risky.

28:22.100 --> 28:24.222
[indistinct chatter,
dogs barking]

28:26.745 --> 28:27.966
All right, yes.

28:28.066 --> 28:31.409
Yes, his methods are...
unconventional.

28:31.509 --> 28:34.532
But he pushes me in a way
that makes me so much better.

28:34.632 --> 28:37.936
I would not be here
if it weren't for him.

28:38.036 --> 28:40.839
Minx is as much his success
as it is mine.

28:42.680 --> 28:45.263
Uh, can you please never,
ever tell him that, though?

28:45.363 --> 28:46.745
Oh, a woman would never.

28:46.845 --> 28:48.787
Great.

28:48.887 --> 28:50.548
Great.

28:50.648 --> 28:53.471
[Rod Stewart's
"You Wear It Well" playing]

28:53.571 --> 28:55.794
Uh...

28:55.894 --> 28:57.275
Um, I'll come with.

28:57.375 --> 29:00.198
[Doug] Well, look at you!
You closed the deal, kid!

29:00.298 --> 29:02.480
We're 50/50 partners,
and I'm telling you,

29:02.580 --> 29:03.882
it's gonna be
different this time.

29:03.982 --> 29:06.845
[Joyce] Actually, 51/49--
Constance insisted.

29:06.945 --> 29:08.927
Well, that's 49 more
than I had this morning.

29:09.027 --> 29:10.488
How's that?

29:10.588 --> 29:12.090
[Joyce] Was it rude not to stay
for the ribbon ceremony?

29:12.190 --> 29:13.491
[Doug] No.
We got what we came for.

29:13.591 --> 29:14.733
Let's go.

29:14.833 --> 29:16.134
[laughter]

29:16.234 --> 29:17.575
So let me get this straight--
I quit my job

29:17.675 --> 29:19.377
to end up at the same place
with the same people

29:19.477 --> 29:20.819
minus three paycheques?

29:20.919 --> 29:22.861
Isn't it great? And now
a countess is in charge.

29:22.961 --> 29:24.222
Uh, former countess.

29:24.322 --> 29:25.784
[Bambi] Hey!

29:25.884 --> 29:27.786
And I just want you to know
that I've actually been

29:27.886 --> 29:29.627
to French Polynesia,

29:29.727 --> 29:31.629
and it's a lot nicer
than this shithole.

29:31.729 --> 29:32.791
[laughter]

29:32.891 --> 29:35.754
But they do not serve
kamikazes.

29:35.854 --> 29:36.915
[all cheer]

29:37.015 --> 29:38.236
Well, to being back, everybody.

29:38.336 --> 29:39.998
-On new terms.
-With back pay.

29:40.098 --> 29:41.399
-We'll see.
-[glasses clink]

29:41.499 --> 29:43.321
-[person] Whoo!
-[laughter]

29:43.421 --> 29:44.602
-[Doug] Mmm.
-[Tina] Mmm, mmm, mmm.

29:44.702 --> 29:46.324
[Richie] Oh, God.

29:46.424 --> 29:48.166
You really gonna leave
all this for business school?

29:48.266 --> 29:50.208
-[Joyce] You want more?
-[Richie] Whoo!

29:50.308 --> 29:52.130
-[Doug chuckles]
-I was thinking about it.

29:52.230 --> 29:53.531
Well, don't.

29:53.631 --> 29:55.013
The best is yet to come.

29:55.113 --> 29:56.414
[Constance]
All right, everyone,

29:56.514 --> 29:58.256
the next round is on me!

29:58.356 --> 29:59.617
