01:05.197 --> 01:07.132
D'oh!

01:26.086 --> 01:29.613
Hey, open up!
I've been standing here all morning!

01:29.722 --> 01:31.622
Hey, Homer. What are you doing at work?

01:31.724 --> 01:34.249
The plant's closed for fumigation.

01:37.397 --> 01:40.366
Uh-oh.

01:43.803 --> 01:45.964
No one told me the plant was closed.

01:46.072 --> 01:48.040
- Didn't you get the e-mail?
- What's an e-mail?

01:48.141 --> 01:50.405
It's a computer thing-
Like an electric letter.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.410
Or a quiet phone call.

01:52.512 --> 01:55.777
- I don't have a computer.
- Too bad.

01:55.882 --> 01:59.511
That's why you're at work
while we're living it up on our day off.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.712
Hey, Carl, turn up the car radio.

02:01.821 --> 02:04.153
Why not? Anything goes today.

02:08.561 --> 02:11.189
That does it! I'm getting a computer-

02:11.297 --> 02:13.595
As soon as somebody
lets me out of here.

02:15.702 --> 02:18.830
Oh.
I'm so stupid.

02:22.509 --> 02:24.534
Uh, I guess I'll take that one.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.544
Hmm. Well, do you need a paperweight?

02:26.646 --> 02:29.774
Because if you buy that machine, that's all
you're gonna have, is an expensive paperweight.

02:29.883 --> 02:33.080
Well, a paperweight would be nice,
but what I really need is a computer.

02:33.186 --> 02:35.279
- How about that one?
- Mm-hmm.

02:35.388 --> 02:37.288
That technology is three months old.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.290
Only suckers buy
out-of-date machines.

02:39.392 --> 02:41.326
Uh, you're not a sucker, are you, sir?

02:41.427 --> 02:43.520
- Heavens, no!
- Oh, good.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.530
Because if you were,
I'd have to ask you to leave the store.

02:45.632 --> 02:47.657
I just need something
to receive e-mail.

02:47.767 --> 02:51.066
You'll need a top-of-the-line machine for that.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.868
That's the same computer
astronauts use to do their taxes.

02:54.974 --> 02:57.943
- I was an astronaut.
- Of course you were.

02:58.044 --> 03:01.571
Hmm.

03:02.882 --> 03:04.782
Five thousand dollars?

03:04.884 --> 03:07.011
You only have 10 seconds to decide, sir.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.522
This is the best computer in the world
and always will be, right?

03:11.624 --> 03:15.116
Absolutely. Just run the deed
to your house through here.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.860
- You are on your-
- Fifth.

03:19.966 --> 03:22.366
mortgage.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.336
Hey, Lisa, check out
my new computer.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.568
Dad, you shouldn't drag that around.

03:30.677 --> 03:33.544
That's right. Top of the line.

03:36.249 --> 03:37.716
Stupid pothole.

03:37.817 --> 03:40.786
Don't worry, head.
The computer will do our thinking now.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.460
Oh, yeah. Perfect.

03:49.562 --> 03:53.225
Now, then- Computer, kill Flanders.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.893
Did I hear my name?
My ears are burning.

03:56.002 --> 03:58.493
Good start. Now finish the job.

03:58.605 --> 04:01.438
Oh, you're busy. Catch you later, "computator."

04:01.541 --> 04:05.944
Oh, $5,000 for a computer,
and it can't handle a simple assignment.

04:09.449 --> 04:13.180
Dad, I'll set up your computer. Why
don't you and Bart go play in the backyard?

04:13.286 --> 04:16.084
You're it!

04:18.825 --> 04:20.759
Hey! Why, you little-

04:20.860 --> 04:23.385
Okay, you're ready to go.

04:23.496 --> 04:25.828
I've written down the basic commands...

04:25.932 --> 04:27.524
so that anyone can understand them.

04:27.634 --> 04:30.603
- Hmm.
- <i>Homer, bring that back in the house.</i>

04:30.703 --> 04:31.670
<i>Fine.</i>

04:38.711 --> 04:40.372
<i>Ooh, a dancing Jesus.</i>

04:41.547 --> 04:45.278
If there's a better use for the Internet,
I haven't found it.

04:45.385 --> 04:49.082
If you've committed a crime
and you want to confess, click "yes."

04:49.188 --> 04:51.088
Otherwise click "No."

04:51.190 --> 04:55.593
You have chosen "No," meaning you've
committed a crime but don't want to confess.

04:55.695 --> 04:58.027
A paddy wagon is now speeding to your home.

04:58.131 --> 05:02.659
- Hey!
- While you wait, why not buy
a police cap or t-shirt?

05:02.769 --> 05:05.033
You have the right
to remain fabulous.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.009
Here it is, everybody-

05:13.112 --> 05:14.579
<i>The world's greatest Web site.</i>

05:14.681 --> 05:17.445
Hello! Hello! Hello!

05:18.484 --> 05:21.282
You'd think all the noises
would be annoying, but they're not.

05:21.387 --> 05:24.083
- I got suspended from school today.
- No kiddin'?

05:24.190 --> 05:27.057
What do you think
of my page, Lisa? Be honest.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.890
It's great, isn't it?
Go ahead and say it's great if you want to.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.759
They found a switchblade in my locker.

05:31.864 --> 05:34.890
Well, a Web page is supposed
to be a personal thing.

05:35.001 --> 05:38.129
You've just stolen copyrighted
material from everyone else.

05:38.237 --> 05:41.263
- They could sue you for that.
- I took a swing at a cop.

05:41.374 --> 05:43.399
They can't sue me
if they don't know who I am.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.876
I'll just call myself"Mr. X."

05:46.979 --> 05:49.914
I'm just mad all the time.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.917
Yep, you can't go wrong with Mr. X.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.118
Mom wants you to come to bed.

05:57.223 --> 06:00.488
I can't. My Web page
hasn't gotten a single hit.

06:00.593 --> 06:03.585
Come on.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.664
You have to offer
people something-

06:05.765 --> 06:08.063
Ajoke, an opinion, an idea.

06:12.972 --> 06:15.566
That lousy pothole!
Why don't they fix it?

06:15.675 --> 06:18.007
I heard Mayor Quimby spent
the street repair fund...

06:18.111 --> 06:20.011
on a secret swimming pool for himself.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.978
- Get out. Who told you that?
- Nelson.

06:22.081 --> 06:25.312
Hmm. That's the kind of dirt
that belongs on my Web page.

06:26.419 --> 06:28.353
You can't post that on the Internet.

06:28.454 --> 06:32.413
- You don't know if it's true.
- Nelson has never steered me wrong, honey.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.425
Nelson is gold.

06:34.527 --> 06:37.189
- You know, it might have been Jimbo.
- Beautiful!

06:37.296 --> 06:39.856
We have confirmation.

06:42.268 --> 06:45.601
Hmm. Let's see here.

06:45.705 --> 06:49.334
"X-rated Girls"-Already book marked.
"Dial 'X ' for Sex."

06:49.442 --> 06:51.433
"Mr. X."

06:51.544 --> 06:55.480
Hmm. Shall I cross
the final frontier?

07:01.187 --> 07:03.655
What's this?

07:03.756 --> 07:07.988
"Stolen funds. Pothole money used
for swimming pool"?

07:08.094 --> 07:10.585
There's no emoticon
for what I'm feeling!

07:11.998 --> 07:13.898
Our mayor is corrupt?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.934
Well, Mr. X has done this town
a great service-

07:16.035 --> 07:17.935
despite his poor grammar and spelling.

07:18.037 --> 07:22.406
<i>Seymour!</i>
Are you looking at naked ladies?
- No, Mother.

07:22.508 --> 07:24.703
<i>You sissy!</i>

07:26.112 --> 07:27.943
What's all this about a secret swimming pool?

07:28.047 --> 07:31.448
What secret swimming pool is that?

07:32.652 --> 07:34.381
Hey, let's look behind that door!

07:34.487 --> 07:36.717
- Aaah!
- <i>Uh, don't go in there!</i>

07:38.891 --> 07:43.225
<i>Oh, that's delicious. Can I have more?</i>

07:43.329 --> 07:47.789
Good Lord! We've discovered
the ruins of an ancient city.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.800
Okay, you do better.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.935
I did it! I changed the world.

07:57.043 --> 08:00.240
Now I know exactly how God feels.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.507
Do you want turkey sausage or ham?

08:02.615 --> 08:05.311
Bring me two of every animal.

08:09.388 --> 08:12.721
A new Internet watchdog
is creating a stir in Springfield.

08:12.825 --> 08:17.285
Mr. X, if that is his real name,
has come up with a sensational scoop.

08:17.396 --> 08:19.421
- Darn tootin'.
- But we must never forget...

08:19.532 --> 08:21.659
that the real news is on local TV...

08:21.767 --> 08:25.828
delivered by real, officially licensed
newsmen like me, Kent Brockman.

08:25.938 --> 08:28.736
How do they get those dogs
to talk on the beer commercials?

08:28.841 --> 08:30.741
Cowboy Steve will tell you.

08:32.378 --> 08:34.312
I'm happy you got
the potholes filled...

08:34.413 --> 08:37.610
but it's still irresponsible
to present rumors as facts.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.775
Maybe you should quit
while you're ahead.

08:39.885 --> 08:42.616
No way. Mr. X is gonna keep on
diggin' and probin'...

08:42.722 --> 08:45.316
until every person
in this town is in jail.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.886
Aaah!

08:48.995 --> 08:51.759
A coconut bagel?
Like poison it tastes!

08:51.864 --> 08:53.764
All right, I'll tell you a secret.

08:53.866 --> 08:57.632
My bagels are nothing
but week-old doughnuts.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.864
Oh, who am I to point the finger?

08:59.972 --> 09:02.907
I once ran over a guy
in a parking lot...

09:03.009 --> 09:05.773
and dumped the body
on a golf course.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.947
What a bombshell!

09:12.618 --> 09:14.848
<i>In the interest of public safety...</i>

09:14.954 --> 09:17.081
we have confiscated
every doughnut...

09:17.189 --> 09:19.987
bagel, cruller and bear claw in the city-

09:20.092 --> 09:22.117
And some coffee.

09:22.228 --> 09:26.028
- This morning Mr. X reported
that your own department-
- I know, I know.

09:26.132 --> 09:29.659
But I assure you, the police
do not take prisoners out of their cells...

09:29.769 --> 09:32.033
and race them... anymore.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.935
What about using the electric chair
to cook chicken?

09:34.040 --> 09:35.871
Yeah, all right,
this press conference is over.

09:35.975 --> 09:37.101
- No, wait. I have-
- No, it's over, Phil.

09:37.209 --> 09:38.176
- But Police Chief Wig-
- It's over.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.142
<i>According to my uncle...</i>

09:40.246 --> 09:43.181
Miss Springfield isn't
as beautiful as she seems.

09:43.282 --> 09:46.615
Word is, she uses appearance-altering cosmetics.

09:46.719 --> 09:48.619
- Oh, my God. That's shocking.
- I don't believe that.

09:48.721 --> 09:51.815
The public should be warned.
I wish Mr. X were here.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.949
Oh, I don't know, Carl.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.255
He might be closer than you think.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.262
- Are you him? Are you Mr. X?
- No.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.332
But you talked in
that real sly voice.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.401
Hey, hey, everybody! Homer's Mr. X!

10:02.501 --> 10:05.231
I am not! Or... am I?

10:05.338 --> 10:06.805
- Are you?
- No!

10:06.906 --> 10:11.206
Well, if Mr. X were here right now,
I'd buy him a tall frosty.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.210
- Hey, Moe, can you keep a secret?
- No.

10:13.312 --> 10:14.711
- Not even a little one?
- No!

10:14.814 --> 10:16.805
- What if I just whisper it!
- No, I tells ya!

10:19.352 --> 10:22.480
# I've been sittin' on the toilet #

10:22.588 --> 10:26.319
#All the livelong day ##

10:26.425 --> 10:29.189
Is everything ready
for the secret meeting?
- Yes, sir.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.729
I hope no one finds out about this.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.822
It's pure journalistic dynamite!

10:33.933 --> 10:36.595
Uh, sir, this place
could be bugged. Shh.

10:36.702 --> 10:39.193
Okay, now we can talk.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.933
Turn it off!

10:47.179 --> 10:50.410
Journalistic dynamite.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.052
Then it's agreed.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.055
I'll supply you terrorists
with deadly uranium.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.182
You are a credit to the great Satan.

11:00.292 --> 11:02.351
Oh, pshaw.

11:02.461 --> 11:05.919
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
I love spying.

11:06.032 --> 11:08.865
Oh, don't worry about those fumes.

11:08.968 --> 11:11.869
They'll be sucked into that air vent.

11:17.710 --> 11:20.008
This place is falling apart.

11:22.448 --> 11:25.747
And who's selling the uranium
to the terrorists?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.751
Mmm.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.720
Mm-hmm. Montgomery Burns.

11:30.823 --> 11:34.122
Now we wait.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.993
Let go of me! I'm innocent!

11:39.098 --> 11:40.963
Whoa, he's in trouble.

11:41.067 --> 11:44.901
We'd like to award this year's
Pulitzer Prize to Mr. X.

11:47.473 --> 11:50.169
Unfortunately, we don't
know who he is...

11:50.276 --> 11:54.007
so his cash award will be used
to feed starving children.

11:54.113 --> 11:56.809
No! Move! Move!

11:56.916 --> 12:01.410
I'm Mr. X! Gimme! Gimme!

12:01.520 --> 12:04.284
- We'll need some proof.
- #Ta-da #

12:04.390 --> 12:07.120
He <i>is</i> Mr. X! Ha!

12:07.226 --> 12:09.353
Thank you, folks.

12:09.462 --> 12:12.898
And now I'm off to expose more
secret conspiracies and-

12:12.998 --> 12:15.933
Oh, I bit my tongue!

12:17.336 --> 12:20.737
- I'm proud that you won the Pulitzer-
- Finally.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.968
But I do feel bad
about the starving children.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.805
They're with God now.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.709
Oh, well, that's good.

12:30.049 --> 12:33.314
- Right.
- Hey, guys. How's it going?

12:33.419 --> 12:35.614
Oh, don't worry
about the Mr. X thing.

12:35.721 --> 12:37.621
I'm just here for a beer.

12:37.723 --> 12:41.454
Uh- I don't know
if I want you in here no more, Homer.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.529
I got a lot of secrets
I'd prefer to keep clandestine.

12:44.630 --> 12:47.428
Uh-Terrible, disturbing secrets.

12:47.533 --> 12:51.162
- So hungry.
- I smell another Pulitzer.

12:53.539 --> 12:56.440
Well, Helen, as it says in the Bible-

12:57.543 --> 13:00.103
I'll tell you later.

13:01.514 --> 13:04.244
Oh, nobody's visiting
my Web page anymore.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.614
My counter is actually going down.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.384
Well, you can't post news
if you don't have any.

13:14.493 --> 13:18.987
That's a great idea. I'll make up some news!

13:19.098 --> 13:22.226
At least take off your Pulitzer Prize
when you say that.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.859
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.564
Let's see now. Bulletin.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.573
New race discovered...

13:29.675 --> 13:32.473
living six inches under...

13:32.578 --> 13:35.513
- Denver.
- Oh, Dad.

13:35.614 --> 13:37.946
All named Morton-

13:38.050 --> 13:40.075
Or Mortinson.

13:40.186 --> 13:44.247
This Mr. X says Spanish and Italian
are the same language.

13:44.356 --> 13:46.256
Well, that's surprising.

13:46.358 --> 13:50.761
They're controlling
our minds with flu shots. I knew it!

13:50.863 --> 13:54.128
Well, kids, now aren't you glad
we don't believe in inoculations?

13:54.233 --> 13:57.225
Yea!

13:57.336 --> 13:59.236
Mommy?

13:59.338 --> 14:01.932
Hey, Mr. X, I got a tip for you.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.202
In science class they're
dissecting frozen hoboes-

14:04.310 --> 14:06.210
And I have the bindles to prove it.

14:06.312 --> 14:08.337
Real news is great, son...

14:08.447 --> 14:12.941
but I'm getting a thousand hits an hour
with grade "A" bull plop.

14:13.052 --> 14:18.354
Give me a hundred lotto tickets, Apu,
because Mr. X is on a roll.

14:18.457 --> 14:22.257
Stop it, Apu. You're scaring me.

14:24.830 --> 14:27.355
Aah! Aah! What's going on?

14:29.101 --> 14:32.093
<i>Help! I'm being kidnapped!</i>

14:38.911 --> 14:41.106
Hmm. Hmm?

14:44.350 --> 14:46.147
Whoo! Ahh.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.220
This is not a library. Whoo.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.981
<i>Save me, Mr. X!</i>

14:50.089 --> 14:51.989
<i>Wait. I'm Mr. X.</i>

14:57.396 --> 14:59.296
What the-

14:59.398 --> 15:01.798
Hmm? Hmm?

15:07.039 --> 15:09.473
What the hell-

15:12.411 --> 15:15.141
How did I get here?
What is this place?

15:15.247 --> 15:18.216
This is... the Island.

15:18.317 --> 15:21.878
- How do I get out of here?
- Oh, no one leaves the Island.

15:21.987 --> 15:24.785
So I'm a prisoner? How come?

15:24.890 --> 15:26.915
Because you know something.

15:27.026 --> 15:29.324
But I don't know anything-
At least I don't think I do.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.158
- See you tomorrow.
- No, you won't!

15:32.264 --> 15:35.665
Hello, Operator!
I'd like to report a really weird island.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.066
Please send lots
of rescue copters to-

15:40.806 --> 15:45.436
All right, whatever.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.922
Welcome, friend.
I'm Number Six.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.024
I'm number 15.
What number are you?

15:59.124 --> 16:01.183
I am not a number! I am a man!

16:01.293 --> 16:03.352
And don't you ever-
Oh, wait. I'm Number Five.

16:03.462 --> 16:07.592
- Ha, ha! In your face, Number Six!
- Yes. Well done.

16:07.700 --> 16:11.966
- Who are all these oddballs?
- Well, they keep us here
because we know too much.

16:12.071 --> 16:15.472
Number 27 there knows how
to turn water into gasoline.

16:15.574 --> 16:18.805
<i>Number 12 knows the deadly</i>
<i>secret behind Tic Tacs.</i>

16:18.911 --> 16:21.505
And I invented the bottomless peanut bag.

16:21.613 --> 16:23.581
Wow!

16:23.682 --> 16:26.549
- So who brought us here?
- I don't know.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.916
- Did you bring us here?
- No!

16:30.689 --> 16:32.987
Don't worry.

16:33.092 --> 16:37.188
If even half of your husband is out here,
Officer Scraps'll find him.

16:37.296 --> 16:39.355
Oh, that's a darling name for a dog.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.508
Yup. He's on the trail,
all right. Uh-oh.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.310
- Better go fish him out, Lou.
- Okay, Chief.

16:59.051 --> 17:01.611
Uh, the shoes are part of the uniform.

17:01.720 --> 17:05.554
Right, Chief.

17:12.564 --> 17:17.558
Oh, they drugged the tea.
They knew my one weakness.

17:22.074 --> 17:24.872
Hello, Number Five.
How's every little thing?

17:24.977 --> 17:26.968
Who are you, and why are you holding me here?

17:27.079 --> 17:29.912
I want answers now
or I want them eventually!

17:30.015 --> 17:32.882
Fair enough. I'll level with you.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.385
Ow. Please, don't do that.

17:35.487 --> 17:37.387
- Sorry.
- I'll be blunt.

17:37.489 --> 17:39.719
Your Web page has
stumbled upon our secret plan.

17:39.825 --> 17:44.285
That's impossible.
All my stories are bull plop. Bull plop!

17:44.396 --> 17:48.025
Don't be cute.
I'm referring to the flu shot exposé.

17:48.133 --> 17:51.660
You see, we're the ones loading them
with mind-controlling additives.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.102
But why?

17:54.206 --> 17:56.174
To drive people
into a frenzy of shopping.

17:56.275 --> 17:59.802
That's why flu shots are given
just before Christmas.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.006
Of course. It's so simple.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.606
Wait. No, it's not.
It's needlessly complicated.

18:05.717 --> 18:09.175
Yes, it is. And we can't have you out
there mucking it up, now can we?

18:09.288 --> 18:12.689
- No, sir.
- That's a good boy. Let's get you some ice cream.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.460
- <i>There we are.</i>
- Look.

18:16.562 --> 18:19.030
You can drug me all you want...

18:19.131 --> 18:22.259
but my family won't rest
until they find my drug-bloated corpse!

18:22.367 --> 18:24.460
I wouldn't count on that, Number Five.

18:24.570 --> 18:28.404
As far as your family knows,
Homer Simpson is walking in the front door...

18:28.507 --> 18:30.634
right about now.

18:30.742 --> 18:33.438
I'm sorry. What?

18:33.545 --> 18:36.537
Homie!

18:36.648 --> 18:39.242
Marge, honey, <i>fraülein,</i> I'm home.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.342
You're not my husband.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.217
<i>Ja.</i> Please forgive
my unexplained two-week absence.

18:44.323 --> 18:48.054
To make it up to you, we will go out
to dinner at a sensibly priced restaurant...

18:48.160 --> 18:51.027
then have a night
of efficient German sex.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.257
Well, I sure don't
feel like cooking.

19:04.343 --> 19:08.245
Aren't there any evil movies on?
Maybe something about an evil island?

19:08.347 --> 19:10.440
There's something really
different about you, Dad.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.951
- I am a new tie wearing.
- Oh, yeah.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.514
I'm tired of being
drugged and gassed.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.526
- There's gotta be a way to escape!
- <i>Psst!</i>

19:22.628 --> 19:25.119
I've worked on this for 33 years.

19:25.230 --> 19:29.599
It's made out of toilet paper rolls,
toothpicks and plastic forks...

19:29.701 --> 19:33.569
and the sail is made
of scabs and dynamite.

19:33.672 --> 19:38.371
It's small and it's smelly,
but it should carry both of us to-

19:38.477 --> 19:41.173
Whoo-hoo!

19:42.314 --> 19:45.306
That-That's the third time
that's happened!

19:51.089 --> 19:53.250
Oh, no! An anti-escape orb!

20:01.934 --> 20:03.993
Huh. That was easy.

20:05.270 --> 20:08.000
Why did you think a big balloon
would stop people?

20:08.106 --> 20:10.006
Shut up! That's why.

20:10.108 --> 20:13.635
Oh! What a horrible four months.
Now to warn everybody!

20:13.745 --> 20:18.478
Some crazy creeps on an island
somewhere are secretly running the world.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.519
- Hey!
- Sorry, old chap...

20:21.620 --> 20:24.521
but you're proving
quite the caterpillar in our buttermilk.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.488
- Huh?
- We're shutting you down.

20:26.592 --> 20:29.686
Not a chance.
No one can silence me but me!

20:29.795 --> 20:33.287
- That arranged can be.
- Wha-

20:33.398 --> 20:36.026
Aaah!

20:39.304 --> 20:40.896
Yes! Fight and struggle.

20:41.006 --> 20:45.067
If I know me,
he won't like being kicked in the crotch.

20:45.177 --> 20:48.908
- <i>Gott in Himmel!</i>
- Oh, Marge.

20:49.014 --> 20:52.541
- It's me, the real Homer.
- Oh, Homie!

20:52.651 --> 20:55.950
Mmm, mmm!

20:57.856 --> 20:59.847
Bravo, Number Five.

20:59.958 --> 21:04.327
But you know what happens to bad
little "fishies" who wriggle through the net.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.329
- Can I turn this off?
- Absolutely.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.059
- Hey!
- Nice to have you back, Homer.

21:09.167 --> 21:11.260
The dog thinks so too.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.203
The dog thinks-

21:17.609 --> 21:19.509
Bad dog.

21:22.514 --> 21:26.041
Once you get used to the "druggings,"
this isn't a bad place.

21:26.151 --> 21:30.053
Oh, it's wonderful-
Truly God's country.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.591
<i>See you on the Island.</i>

21:35.694 --> 21:38.563
<i>Yes, the Island.</i>

22:23.909 --> 22:25.877
Shh!
