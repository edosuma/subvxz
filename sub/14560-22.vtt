WEBVTT

00:13.414 --> 00:14.382
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

00:14.415 --> 00:15.483
Excuse me.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.051
ALAN:
I see.

00:17.085 --> 00:17.985
So, it's not just at home

00:18.018 --> 00:20.054
you drop your things
all over the place.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.189
Thanks. What do you got there?

00:21.222 --> 00:22.223
Uh, it's a
police scanner.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.457
Well, it's not
just the police.

00:23.491 --> 00:24.692
The "Double-E" guys did
some modifications.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.127
Picks up pretty much

00:26.160 --> 00:27.128
every law enforcement
band there is.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.363
You're not close enough
to the action as it is?

00:29.397 --> 00:30.798
You have to monitor
radio calls now?

00:30.831 --> 00:32.666
I just don't want
to miss anything.

00:32.700 --> 00:36.637
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:36.670 --> 00:38.739
Oh, wow.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.608
Didn't we move you in here
around, what,

00:40.641 --> 00:41.809
three weeks ago?

00:41.842 --> 00:43.444
Oh, my gosh, Charlie.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.513
You have to see what I
found-- these are amazing.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.215
CHARLIE: What are you doing
here?

00:47.248 --> 00:48.316
I thought you
were headed downtown.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.617
Oh, well, that
was a lie,

00:49.650 --> 00:50.751
so I could
surprise you.

00:50.784 --> 00:51.852
- Oh.
- I wanted to get

00:51.885 --> 00:52.986
all your stuff unpacked
and put away.

00:53.020 --> 00:56.224
And I asked Sharon to transpose
your work off the boxes.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.225
Sharon?

00:57.258 --> 00:58.226
- Sharon, thanks.
- Hi.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.328
Anybody else buried in
the rubble around here?

01:00.361 --> 01:02.263
Nope, just the two of us.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.197
But, Charlie, you have
to read these letters.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.099
I found them in the
old wall secretary.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.334
Oh, then Beiderman must
have left them...

01:06.367 --> 01:07.368
But one is from
Beiderman,

01:07.401 --> 01:09.270
but another one
is from Knox,

01:09.303 --> 01:10.871
and another one
is from Newberry.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.540
And this one...

01:12.573 --> 01:15.143
dates all the way back to 1922.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.377
It was written by Hightower.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.745
- May I?
- Wow.

01:17.778 --> 01:20.214
Those are the professors
that preceded you

01:20.248 --> 01:21.515
- in this office, right?
- CHARLIE: Yeah.

01:21.549 --> 01:24.352
Those guys were giants
in the math world.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.287
Yeah, but they weren't giants
when they wrote these.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.721
That's what's so cool
about them.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.590
I mean, they were
just starting out.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.392
The letters are about their
goals and expectations,

01:31.425 --> 01:33.294
what they hoped to accomplish
in their careers.

01:33.327 --> 01:36.897
Hightower wrote the first one
right after he moved in,

01:36.930 --> 01:38.266
almost 90 years ago.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.434
And then, he left it
behind for Knox.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.136
Then, Knox did the
same for Newberry,

01:42.170 --> 01:43.404
who did the same
for Beiderman.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.438
That's quite an
incredible tradition

01:44.472 --> 01:45.706
when you come
to think of it.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.175
- Yeah.
- I know.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.609
And now Beiderman left
them behind for you.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.145
How cool is that?

01:51.179 --> 01:52.646
Well, it was different
for those guys

01:52.680 --> 01:54.648
'cause, you know, they
started out in this office,

01:54.682 --> 01:56.817
and I just moved in
from down the hall.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.752
Yeah, but it might be fun,
though, huh?

01:58.786 --> 02:01.655
Trying to imagine what it
will be like 20 years from now,

02:01.689 --> 02:03.257
what you'll be doing.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.293
WOMAN (over radio):
Supervisor requests FBI presence

02:05.326 --> 02:06.494
at possible 211.

02:06.527 --> 02:07.561
These guys
were smooth.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.863
They got at least six figures
and were long gone

02:09.897 --> 02:11.365
before the first call
went out.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.734
This here is the branch manager,
Clifford Hansen.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.336
How are you doing,
Mr. Hansen?

02:15.369 --> 02:17.271
So, what can you
tell us?

02:17.305 --> 02:20.574
Uh... guy came in
wearing a maintenance uniform.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.410
Went, uh, right
for the alarm panel.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.278
By the time the teller
alerted me,

02:24.312 --> 02:26.414
I guess he'd already cut
the alarm and the cameras.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.182
And it was just the one guy?

02:28.216 --> 02:29.783
Three more came in right after,
pulling on masks.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.653
Camera only caught
the first one, though.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.922
And what kind of, uh,

02:34.955 --> 02:36.357
masks did the
other three wear?

02:36.390 --> 02:38.426
Two of them wore, uh,
ski masks, you know,

02:38.459 --> 02:40.894
and the third guy, the guy who
looked like he was in charge,

02:40.928 --> 02:42.930
he wore
a Bill Clinton mask.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.936
And they put you all
in a back room?

02:51.305 --> 02:52.440
And they separated you:

02:52.473 --> 02:53.874
employees in one,
customers in the other.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.543
Yeah.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.411
How did you know that?

02:57.445 --> 03:00.348
I'm getting a big-time
dГ©jГ  vu thing about now.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.785
Yeah, two of them cleared out
the tellers' drawers,

03:04.818 --> 03:06.454
and the other two hit the vault.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.356
Nikk, come on...
you're starting to freak me out.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.923
Hey, did you hear any gunshots?

03:09.957 --> 03:11.359
HANSEN:
We didn't hear anything.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.660
I waited 10 minutes,
like they told us,

03:12.693 --> 03:14.595
and then, when I came out here,
they were gone.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.665
No, no,
not all of them.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.301
No, only three of them left.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.281
How did you do that?

03:48.496 --> 03:50.264
COLBY: This is our dead
jack-in-the-box.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.465
His name is Greg Berlin.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.700
Habitual B and E guy

03:52.733 --> 03:55.269
who specializes in
high-end security systems.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.404
Well, that's
our best lead.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.705
Let's get into him.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.873
We can, but I'm pretty sure
it's a dead end.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.675
Here we go again:
the Amazing Nikki.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.876
NIKKI:
Look, the robbery this morning

04:02.910 --> 04:04.745
is an exact copy
of one I rolled on

04:04.778 --> 04:05.979
back when I was
a rookie cop.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.681
When you say "exact copy"...

04:07.715 --> 04:08.982
I mean every detail,

04:09.016 --> 04:10.984
right down to the
stiff in the cabinet.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.920
Now, if they stuck
to the old plan,

04:12.953 --> 04:15.489
they hired this guy on
right before the heist.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.824
COLBY: As soon as he
finished his bit

04:16.857 --> 04:19.026
with the alarms, they put
the bullet in his head.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.794
LIZ: Which is why
they left him behind.

04:20.828 --> 04:21.895
He's doesn't connect to the rest

04:21.929 --> 04:23.397
of the crew--
can't lead back to them.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.698
And he's the only one
caught on camera.

04:24.732 --> 04:25.899
Other three
might as well be ghosts.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.669
Well, we got to have a file
from that first one, though.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.738
We do-- 2002.
I pulled it already,

04:30.771 --> 04:32.906
but it's unsolved--
there were no suspects.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.342
DAVID: That's just no
official suspects, right?

04:34.375 --> 04:35.943
I mean, the lead agent,
he'd have some kind

04:35.976 --> 04:38.045
of theories.
Yeah, who is it?

04:38.078 --> 04:38.879
(chuckles softly)

04:38.912 --> 04:40.047
Take a look at this.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.383
The lead agent: Roger Bloom.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.584
(chuckles)

04:44.685 --> 04:45.986
What? Who is Bloom?

04:46.019 --> 04:48.055
Agent we teamed up with
eight months back.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.723
DAVID: Don caught him with
his hand in the cookie jar.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.659
- Ended Bloom's career.
- COLBY: All right.

04:51.692 --> 04:54.528
I'll tell you what-- Nikki and I
will go give him a try.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.430
- Why me?
- He hasn't met you.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.865
He won't hate you yet.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.933
(Nikki sighs)

05:02.636 --> 05:03.904
COLBY:
Hey, Bloom.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.973
Why don't you let me
give you a hand?

05:06.006 --> 05:07.408
I don't need anything
from you, Granger.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.642
Hey, he's just trying
to help.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.078
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.013
I'm sure you both drove out here

05:13.046 --> 05:15.616
just to help me dig up
my sewer line.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.050
You're right.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.420
Actually, we came out here
'cause we need your help.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.755
(laughing)

05:21.789 --> 05:22.823
We're working
a bank heist.

05:22.856 --> 05:23.824
(laughing):
Yeah.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.359
You find that funny? Funny?

05:25.393 --> 05:27.561
I find that hysterical.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.062
I put in 32 years.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.464
What did I get?

05:30.498 --> 05:31.765
Forced retirement,

05:31.799 --> 05:33.867
my pension's revoked,
I'm standing

05:33.901 --> 05:35.936
in a mud hole
in the middle of my front yard

05:35.969 --> 05:37.538
'cause I can't afford a plumber.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.706
All because of the FBI.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.008
Good luck with your
case there, agents.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.976
Actually, Bloom,
it was your case.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.679
Bank robbery, 2002.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.481
Farmers American Bank.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.348
Four-man crew.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.117
Capped one of their own,
left him behind.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.885
COLBY: Looks like
they're back at it.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.987
An exact duplicate
happened this morning.

05:54.021 --> 05:54.888
Now, in your file,

05:54.922 --> 05:56.857
I noticed you had
no suspects listed,

05:56.890 --> 05:58.592
but I'm assuming
you had somebody in mind,

05:58.626 --> 05:59.627
or a theory at least.

06:01.429 --> 06:04.465
Yeah, there was a guy
named, uh, Curtis Brennan.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.700
Why did you suspect him?

06:07.835 --> 06:09.537
'Cause the pieces fit.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.705
He had the smarts,
he had the history.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.608
And word was that he spent
a lot of cash afterwards.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.477
I just couldn't make it stick.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.978
You think Brennan
and his crew

06:18.011 --> 06:18.812
could be back at it?

06:18.846 --> 06:21.114
(chuckling):
Yeah, they might be...

06:21.148 --> 06:23.183
if they didn't get themselves
killed three years ago

06:23.216 --> 06:24.985
doing a casino job.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.820
No, I think you're wrong

06:26.854 --> 06:28.021
about making a connection
with today's heist.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.157
More likely, you were wrong
about Brennan to begin with.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.793
Yeah, well, I guess
that we're done then, huh?

06:41.101 --> 06:44.037
AMITA: I think Knox's letter
is my favorite.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.740
Here he is, what,
27 when he writes it,

06:46.774 --> 06:49.610
and he already knows exactly
what he's going to accomplish.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.111
(indistinct radio transmissions)

06:51.144 --> 06:53.213
Charlie.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.148
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.618
Why am I the only one
fascinated by these?

06:57.651 --> 06:58.251
(turns off scanner)

06:58.285 --> 06:59.219
I mean, you worship Knox.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.121
When you taught ergodic theory,

07:01.154 --> 07:03.190
you lectured on his work
for two weeks.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.525
I think Knox was amazing.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.659
So, why aren't you

07:05.693 --> 07:07.761
more excited
about these letters?

07:07.795 --> 07:10.097
If I were you, I would
be thrilled to write one.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.665
I tell you what.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.567
You can write mine.

07:13.601 --> 07:14.768
Charlie.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.036
What?

07:16.069 --> 07:17.004
Both Knox and Newberry

07:17.037 --> 07:18.872
were huge proponents
of collaborative work.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.141
I'm sure neither of them
would roll over in their grave

07:21.174 --> 07:23.076
if you did a first draft for me.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.178
Why are you so reluctant
to do this?

07:25.212 --> 07:27.247
I don't know.
(knock on door)

07:27.280 --> 07:29.216
LIZ: Wow, love what you've done
with the place.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.118
Oh, well, I've been
kind of busy.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.953
Then, we're not going
to be any help.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.054
Uh, we're working
on a bank robbery.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.490
Yeah, Don told me--
guys got away seven years ago,

07:36.524 --> 07:38.559
- and now they've done it again?
- But there's no way

07:38.592 --> 07:39.793
these were
their only two crimes.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.028
I mean, these guys
are experienced.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.195
They had to pull other jobs,

07:42.229 --> 07:43.030
maybe even got caught somewhere
else.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.131
Okay.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.199
You remember how you helped me
on the Sneaker case,

07:46.233 --> 07:48.268
how we ran a search algorithm
to look for similarities

07:48.301 --> 07:49.903
between the current crime
and past crimes?

07:49.937 --> 07:51.739
Yeah, we analyzed a break-in

07:51.772 --> 07:53.741
and found a suspect
who used a similar methodology.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.676
We're hoping you could
do the same thing here,

07:55.709 --> 07:57.911
maybe tie these guys
to a previous crime.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.046
I can take a look.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.213
I'm going to need
all the old files.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.950
You really want us
to bring them here?

08:04.084 --> 08:05.519
Oh... no.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.555
I... I better come to you.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.699
All right, what?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.902
What, what? You're clearly
pissed.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.137
I mean, you've been
giving me the chill

08:24.171 --> 08:26.273
ever since we
left Bloom's.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.141
What, you think I went
too hard on him?

08:28.175 --> 08:29.743
You were getting him
to open up,

08:29.777 --> 08:30.911
and I shut him down, right?

08:30.944 --> 08:32.179
Wow.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.847
You really are psychic,

08:33.881 --> 08:36.316
'cause yeah, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.186
You know, I'm sorry,
but a dirty cop is a dirty cop.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.688
You even know what he did?

08:40.721 --> 08:42.022
I know he took a lot of
money that wasn't his.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.257
Do you know why?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.762
He was chasing this kid
who embezzled some money

08:48.796 --> 08:50.263
from a bunch
of different companies,

08:50.297 --> 08:52.900
and he thought the FBI wasn't
giving it enough attention.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.068
So, he stole money
and then blamed it on the kid?

08:55.102 --> 08:57.237
With no intention
of actually keeping it.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.839
You can hear yourself
right now, right?

08:58.872 --> 09:02.075
Look, the guy logged 30 years.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.877
Okay, he ran kidnap rescue.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.145
He ran the bank division.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.814
He won every commendation

09:06.847 --> 09:07.948
there is to win.
(scoffs)

09:07.981 --> 09:09.316
He did a thousand
things right

09:09.349 --> 09:12.085
in his career, and then
messed up once-- that's it.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.855
You know, it's a good thing

09:14.888 --> 09:16.990
that you can't read my mind
right now.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.828
LIZ:
Is it going to disturb you guys

09:20.861 --> 09:21.962
if I run through some video?

09:21.995 --> 09:24.665
DAVID: I don't think anything's
going to bother Charlie.

09:24.698 --> 09:25.666
He's in that zone.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.037
And I got a week's worth
of bank footage to go through.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.104
I'm hoping one of the crew

09:31.138 --> 09:33.240
was going to case the place
before the robbery.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.776
Well, that sounds
like a lot of faces.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.278
I'll mark anyone who
looks suspicious, go back later

09:38.311 --> 09:40.213
and run them against
facial recognition.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.249
Hey, I think
I found something...

09:42.282 --> 09:43.984
or the search algorithm did,

09:44.017 --> 09:45.619
and it's not what
we were looking for.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.187
- DAVID: What do you mean?
- Uh...

09:47.220 --> 09:49.857
two months ago, someone
hit a bank in Riverside.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.192
It's an exact duplicate
of a 1994 robbery.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.794
And then, there was another

09:53.827 --> 09:56.964
five months ago in...
Fountain Valley,

09:56.997 --> 09:58.766
and the details
match perfectly

09:58.799 --> 10:00.734
with a 1989 robbery.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.269
So, it wasn't
the first time these guys

10:02.302 --> 10:04.071
recycled one
of their old heists?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.806
Well, uh, that's
the thing.

10:05.839 --> 10:06.974
Given the dates

10:07.007 --> 10:08.709
and the vast differences
in their MO,

10:08.742 --> 10:10.811
it seems like none
of the original three

10:10.844 --> 10:12.379
were committed by
the same crew.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.316
Meaning...?

10:16.349 --> 10:18.652
Someone's copycatting
old bank robberies.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.821
Somehow, they're finding
these old crimes,

10:20.854 --> 10:23.256
unsolved cases where
the FBI or police

10:23.290 --> 10:24.291
never even had
a suspect.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.325
Perfect crimes.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.259
In essence, yeah.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.829
This, uh, a new crew,
they're replaying

10:28.862 --> 10:30.030
Bank Robberies'
Greatest Hits.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.064
These are the three?

10:31.098 --> 10:32.399
Charlie ran a
search algorithm

10:32.432 --> 10:34.101
on the Farmers
American Bank job,

10:34.134 --> 10:35.936
see if we the MOs
match anything

10:35.969 --> 10:37.370
other than just
the '02 heist.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.172
And we can't keep doing that?

10:39.206 --> 10:40.407
I mean, we have
three more robberies,

10:40.440 --> 10:41.508
which means more data.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.177
I mean, more likely you can find
similarities, right?

10:44.211 --> 10:45.278
Uh, yes, but no

10:45.312 --> 10:47.414
because similarities aren't
what's important now.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.782
What's important are
the differences.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.217
What we really
need is a good

10:50.250 --> 10:52.019
heuristic anomaly
detection scheme--

10:52.052 --> 10:54.087
uh, something as simple as, uh--

10:54.121 --> 10:55.823
well, let's say
you're using a copy machine.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.925
You're making copies
of a number of photographs.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.060
You run each one
through the machine

11:00.093 --> 11:02.763
and you compare the copies
to the originals.

11:02.796 --> 11:03.764
Now, similarities
are irrelevant.

11:03.797 --> 11:04.765
They're expected.

11:04.798 --> 11:05.833
After all, you're making a copy.

11:05.866 --> 11:06.633
However,

11:06.666 --> 11:08.368
if you discover differences--

11:08.401 --> 11:11.438
flaws, for example,
that aren't in the original--

11:11.471 --> 11:13.373
well, now you've got
something relevant.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.743
You have found
a signature feature

11:15.776 --> 11:17.978
of the individual copy.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.112
If we look for
enough differences

11:19.146 --> 11:20.280
in enough copies...

11:20.313 --> 11:23.350
Then we'll be able to tell
what photocopier they used.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.252
- Right.
- DON: Look at this.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.254
All these were checked out
recently.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.989
NIKKI:
By who?

11:29.022 --> 11:30.390
DAVID:
Excuse me.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.459
These three files right here
were recently signed out.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.094
We need to know
who had them.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.063
Should say
in the back.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.330
Well, whoever it was
didn't want

11:37.364 --> 11:38.766
their signature
to be recognized.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.001
You have to show a badge
ID to get 'em, right?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.035
(sighs)

11:42.069 --> 11:43.737
Give me the file numbers.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.338
They're all 91A-LAs.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.274
21-245,

11:47.307 --> 11:51.444
13-545,
and 41-808.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.445
Okay.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.048
Those were all checked out
by Agent Sinclair.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.349
I'm Sinclair.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.318
I want to know
who had them before me.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.487
Next back would be Agent Bloom.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.488
NIKKI:
Agent Roger Bloom?

12:01.521 --> 12:03.757
He checked out a
bunch of files--

12:03.791 --> 12:04.691
all unsolved bank robberies.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.759
DAVID: Bloom hasn't been an
active agent

12:05.793 --> 12:06.927
since last November.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.329
Why would you let him
check out files?

12:09.362 --> 12:10.764
I had no idea he wasn't active.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.399
He was the lead agent
on most of the files.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.400
Look,

12:13.433 --> 12:15.535
David, she's not the one
we should be talking to.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.237
Thank you.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.340
(mutters)

12:34.487 --> 12:37.024
(sighs)

12:39.893 --> 12:41.061
(slams file on table)

12:41.094 --> 12:42.162
That your signature?

12:43.296 --> 12:45.498
Wow, that is bad penmanship.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.969
(sighs)

12:49.002 --> 12:51.271
All right,
for the sake of argument...

12:51.304 --> 12:53.106
yeah, I'll say yes.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.374
Yeah, for argument's sake,

12:54.407 --> 12:56.409
you checked out two
dozen old bank files.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.845
Why?

12:57.878 --> 13:01.081
Because I ran bank division
for 14 years

13:01.114 --> 13:03.050
and I got nostalgic.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.085
COLBY: Bet he never thought he'd
be back in here again.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.489
You feeling
sorry for him?

13:09.522 --> 13:11.491
I'm just saying
it's got to be humiliating,

13:11.524 --> 13:14.527
being back here
like this.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.064
Impersonating an FBI
agent is a felony.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.165
You know that.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.467
I never told that clerk
that I was an active agent.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.501
Right,

13:21.534 --> 13:23.436
but you never said
you weren't either, did you?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.605
What are you doing, Eppes?

13:25.638 --> 13:28.508
What you did to me is
not enough already?

13:28.541 --> 13:31.178
Are you trying to make a case
out of these ancient files?

13:31.211 --> 13:32.445
DAVID: There was a bank robbery
this morning.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.581
Okay, every detail
of this file recreated.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.449
You checked it out

13:36.483 --> 13:39.152
three weeks ago.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.955
Are you saying
that I robbed the bank?

13:41.989 --> 13:44.491
Say you didn't.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.527
I'm not saying another word.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.570
Colby, check this out.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.307
It's two days ago.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.911
Guy at the counter.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.215
Okay, what about him?

14:08.248 --> 14:10.217
I think he's been
casing the place.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.423
That's Bloom.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.367
Is all this necessary?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.601
Moving him in here,
making him play

14:28.635 --> 14:31.138
the isolation game
like he's some felon.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.506
It is if he is a felon.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.441
Don, the guy's
an ex-agent.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.243
I mean, that's got
to count for something.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.544
Yeah, well,
then it cuts both ways.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.246
Then he should be cooperating
with us.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.014
All right.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.149
How long you planning
on sweating him?

14:42.182 --> 14:44.217
I want to search his apartment
while we got him here.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.553
Call Robin and get a
rush warrant, all right?

14:46.586 --> 14:48.155
- No, Don...
- Hey,

14:48.188 --> 14:49.389
it's not a debate.

14:52.425 --> 14:56.329
Hey, how's your heuristic
anomaly detector thing going?

14:56.363 --> 14:57.697
I'm still working out
the initial algorithm.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.598
And did you tell it

14:58.631 --> 15:00.667
that ex-Agent Bloom is now
our suspect?

15:00.700 --> 15:05.472
Well, that would only introduce
an unnecessary bias.

15:05.505 --> 15:10.210
W-We don't want
to influence the analysis

15:10.243 --> 15:13.046
unfairly by presupposing
Bloom's guilt.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.281
You sound like Colby.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.950
So how long is it going
to take to run?

15:16.984 --> 15:18.318
Hopefully I'll have something
for you later tonight,

15:18.351 --> 15:19.987
maybe tomorrow.
So for now,

15:20.020 --> 15:22.055
the only connection
between the current crimes

15:22.089 --> 15:24.191
is the obvious one-- Bloom.

15:29.029 --> 15:32.132
(chuckles)

15:32.165 --> 15:34.734
Page three
of the FBI interrogation manual.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.270
(chuckles) "After the initial
isolation period,

15:37.304 --> 15:38.271
"try to establish

15:38.305 --> 15:41.008
"a rapport with the suspect

15:41.041 --> 15:42.742
"through a token gesture,
like a candy bar,

15:42.775 --> 15:46.046
"cup of coffee...

15:46.079 --> 15:48.348
bottle of water."

15:49.449 --> 15:51.451
(door opening)

16:02.029 --> 16:04.064
All right, so how do you want
to do this?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.999
Want to go room by room
or you want to split it up?

16:06.033 --> 16:08.668
I don't have to keep an eye
on you or anything in here,

16:08.701 --> 16:09.736
do I?

16:09.769 --> 16:11.071
You're not gonna do
anything stupid?

16:11.104 --> 16:12.739
- Is that a joke?
- I mean,

16:12.772 --> 16:14.007
you're not gonna try
to cover anything up

16:14.041 --> 16:17.044
or leave some kind of sign so
Bloom would know we were here.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.112
Really? You think
that I'd do that?

16:19.146 --> 16:20.580
Well, normally, no,

16:20.613 --> 16:23.083
but I can't get any kind
of handle on you on this one.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.656
DON:
Your last investigation...

16:29.689 --> 16:32.125
We're not going all the way back
to Kevin Oliver's case,

16:32.159 --> 16:32.925
are we?

16:32.959 --> 16:35.062
Well, there's $10 million
missing.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.129
I don't care
that IA couldn't prove it.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.364
You and I both know
you took it.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.365
The only thing

16:38.398 --> 16:42.035
we both know is
that every penny was returned.

16:42.069 --> 16:45.205
Yeah, well, that leaves you
$10 million light.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.776
And maybe if you
talked to me,

16:49.809 --> 16:51.211
but you don't.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.746
Look, I just see
you feeling sorry

16:53.780 --> 16:54.714
for this guy, defending him,

16:54.747 --> 16:57.450
and I just can't make
any sense out of it.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.453
Yeah.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.089
You know what, Nikk,
I don't know how much

17:02.122 --> 17:05.092
anybody might have told you
about my father.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.129
I know he died when you were 15.

17:10.263 --> 17:11.764
Yep.

17:13.400 --> 17:17.770
He was going up into
the mountains on a fishing trip.

17:17.804 --> 17:18.705
There was 20 miles of road

17:18.738 --> 17:20.073
and there was
a steel guardrail that...

17:20.107 --> 17:20.940
(sighs)

17:20.973 --> 17:22.742
...covered
every single inch of it...

17:22.775 --> 17:23.843
(clears throat)

17:23.876 --> 17:25.778
...except
for one 50-yard stretch.

17:28.548 --> 17:32.285
That's the spot that
his truck went off the cliff.

17:36.123 --> 17:39.292
I'm sorry.

17:39.326 --> 17:40.460
That is some serious bad luck.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.698
Yeah, it's either bad luck

17:45.732 --> 17:48.801
or that's the spot
he was aiming for.

17:50.137 --> 17:52.272
What, you think
he killed himself?

17:52.305 --> 17:54.207
I'll never know.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.576
All I do know is
that he spent 20 years

17:56.609 --> 17:58.178
as a foreman in a machine shop

17:58.211 --> 18:00.147
pounding out tractor parts.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.416
Then he makes one mistake
and they can him.

18:06.553 --> 18:10.323
He just never get over
how that one mistake just erased

18:10.357 --> 18:12.592
everything else
that he'd done for them.

18:12.625 --> 18:16.196
You do a lot of thinking
since you got fired?

18:16.229 --> 18:18.498
Play it over and over
in your head?

18:18.531 --> 18:20.467
Maybe you started
to rationalize.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.170
You're the one that was wronged,
you're the victim.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.371
Now you're
on page 19

18:24.404 --> 18:26.173
of the manual.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.241
"Attempt to agitate
the suspect,

18:28.275 --> 18:30.777
elicit an emotional reaction."

18:30.810 --> 18:33.513
Oh, come on, Eppes.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.549
I spent 30 years
on that side of the table.

18:39.486 --> 18:42.722
You're not going to get
a confession out of me.

18:42.755 --> 18:45.158
And without a confession,
what have you got?

18:46.259 --> 18:47.660
I got you in the bank

18:47.694 --> 18:49.429
two days before the robbery.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.832
I got you with a file detailing
it three weeks before that.

18:52.865 --> 18:57.337
Maybe there's
a whole other explanation.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.438
So give it to me, Roger.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.240
Let me help you.

19:00.273 --> 19:03.710
(chuckling): Help me like you
helped me right out of a career.

19:03.743 --> 19:04.711
You think I wanted

19:04.744 --> 19:06.179
to do that, really?

19:06.213 --> 19:08.248
Pal, I joined the Bureau
'cause of guys like you.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.316
It killed me to turn you in.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.317
You gave me no choice.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.318
It was my
sister,

19:11.351 --> 19:12.752
Eppes.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.322
He took every penny
of her life savings.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.756
What wouldn't
you do

19:16.789 --> 19:19.426
for your brother?

19:20.527 --> 19:22.795
NIKKI:
Hey, Colby, in here.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.232
Southern Coast
Savings and Loans.

19:25.265 --> 19:28.601
He's got blueprints, photos,
diagrams of traffic patterns.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.338
He's even drawn
out the interior.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.709
Here's a copy of an FBI file.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.445
Robbery at this very bank
in 1998.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.213
Let me guess.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.214
Unsolved?

19:41.248 --> 19:43.883
Looks like Bloom's got plans.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.756
You know, you guys
are just shining examples

19:49.789 --> 19:50.757
of law enforcement.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.225
I don't have
to give you

19:52.259 --> 19:54.294
the whole "don't leave
town" speech, do I?

19:54.327 --> 19:56.496
Oh, please.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.604
No way he'll know
you were there, right?

20:04.637 --> 20:06.906
We were careful.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.841
(elevator bell dings)

20:14.046 --> 20:16.249
(crickets chirping)

20:20.353 --> 20:22.555
Oh... what is this for?

20:22.589 --> 20:23.923
It's for you.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.992
Don't get too excited
until you see what it is.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.361
All right.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.362
Oh, it's a pen.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.963
Mm-hmm.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.333
To write
the letter.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.002
Don't tell me you didn't see
that one coming.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.904
Why is this so
important to you?

20:37.937 --> 20:40.340
For the same reasons
it should be important to you.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.609
She's not going to let up,
you know that, Charlie?

20:42.642 --> 20:44.477
And I have to say
I think she's right.

20:44.511 --> 20:45.512
I know she's right.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.013
I know I should
write this letter.

20:47.046 --> 20:52.385
I just don't know what
the future holds, so...

20:52.419 --> 20:55.054
Well, what do you want it
to hold?

20:55.087 --> 20:56.289
Write about that.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.290
Yeah,

20:57.324 --> 20:58.558
what about your emergence work?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.927
You seemed to be having a real
breakthrough a few weeks ago.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.929
Yeah, and then my
brother got stabbed

21:02.962 --> 21:06.399
and then there was
the serial killer case.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.401
And what does that got to do
with writing the letter?

21:08.435 --> 21:10.770
Never mind.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.272
Thank you for the pen.

21:27.053 --> 21:27.954
DON (over radio):
Anyone got eyes on him?

21:27.987 --> 21:29.689
Nothing yet,
but we have got a clear view

21:29.722 --> 21:31.023
of the side
approach.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.392
Colby, how about you?

21:32.425 --> 21:34.394
Negative.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.464
Man, this guy's been
dragged in

21:37.497 --> 21:38.931
and grilled.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.600
He's already got the take
from the last three robberies.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.570
If it was me, I would just
quit while I was ahead.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.043
Now, the crime he's
copying from '89--

21:51.077 --> 21:53.045
they hit just
after lunch, so if

21:53.079 --> 21:54.381
they're following
the old plan...

21:54.414 --> 21:55.548
Wait a minute.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.417
I got him. Gold four-door

21:57.450 --> 21:58.585
rolling down Sixth.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.558
DON:
Yeah, I got him.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.527
Looks like he's alone.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.261
You really didn't think
he'd come, did you?

22:13.132 --> 22:17.103
Oh, what's he doing?

22:17.136 --> 22:18.405
I don't know.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.439
Waiting, I guess.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.574
On them.

22:21.608 --> 22:22.942
COLBY: It looks like we got more
players

22:22.975 --> 22:23.843
in the two-tone Chrysler.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.812
All right, let's hold tight,
everyone.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.547
Let them get in for SWAT.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.083
DAVID:
Bad guys are moving.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.754
COLBY:
All right, Bloom's out.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.956
NIKKI:
Oh, what the hell is he doing?

22:36.989 --> 22:38.525
Freeze!

22:38.558 --> 22:39.459
He's gonna try
and stop them.

22:39.492 --> 22:40.860
(automatic gunfire)

22:47.767 --> 22:49.836
FBI! FBI!

22:55.442 --> 22:56.843
(yells)

23:01.881 --> 23:03.115
Get in!

23:04.684 --> 23:07.520
(tires screeching)

23:10.457 --> 23:12.425
Bloom, put
the gun down!

23:12.459 --> 23:14.827
Put it down, Bloom.

23:18.631 --> 23:19.666
(indistinct shouting)

23:28.975 --> 23:30.477
Why isn't he in cuffs?!

23:30.510 --> 23:31.844
He wasn't with
them, Don.

23:31.878 --> 23:32.712
Yeah, he wasn't, all right?

23:32.745 --> 23:35.214
He was actually trying
to stop them.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.048
How did you know
they'd be here, Bloom?

23:36.082 --> 23:37.216
14 years in the bank
division, Eppes.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.585
I figured it out.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.186
I almost had them
at the last job.

23:40.219 --> 23:41.821
COLBY:
Wait a minute.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.690
You've been working this case
from the beginning?

23:43.723 --> 23:44.491
Five months.

23:44.524 --> 23:45.357
Ever since
the Fountain Valley job.

23:45.391 --> 23:47.560
I've been way out
ahead of you guys.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.862
That's why you had the files,
that's why you were in the bank.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.498
Didn't I tell you there
was another explanation?

23:51.531 --> 23:52.965
Turn around,
give me those hands.

23:52.999 --> 23:53.500
Oh, are you kidding me?

23:53.533 --> 23:54.567
Give me your hands.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.969
Prior knowledge of a felony,
failed to report it.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.137
(handcuffs clicking)
You're an accessory, Bloom.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.405
Not in a
million years.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.641
You endangered all these people
around here, not to my agents.

24:01.674 --> 24:04.677
Not one person got hurt, except,
of course, for a bad guy, Don.

24:04.711 --> 24:08.214
Let me make this
as clear as possible, okay?

24:08.247 --> 24:09.148
You are not an agent.

24:09.181 --> 24:12.118
You are nobody
as far as this case goes.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.820
All right, he's got
the message, Don.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.655
- He's got the message.
- Take him in.

24:15.688 --> 24:16.823
(helicopter blades whirring)

24:16.856 --> 24:19.258
(indistinct radio transmissions)

24:19.291 --> 24:20.827
Charlie, what are
you doing here?

24:20.860 --> 24:21.894
I caught it on
the scanner.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.863
- We got 'em, huh?
- DAVID: No, it wasn't Bloom.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.197
He was chasing
them, just like us.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.203
CHARLIE: We've been overlooking
something.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.139
Information flow.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.541
The guys we're after

24:34.574 --> 24:36.242
had to have learned the details

24:36.275 --> 24:37.877
of the original heists
somewhere, right?

24:37.910 --> 24:40.913
Yeah, until now, we thought they
got it from the FBI files.

24:40.947 --> 24:41.948
But if it's not Bloom?

24:41.981 --> 24:43.750
LIZ: Where would they learn
about the crimes?

24:43.783 --> 24:46.152
It's not like there's
a bank robber newsletter, or

24:46.185 --> 24:48.521
a social club where they sit
around and swap stories.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.690
Yeah there is-- prison.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.625
Maybe somebody from
the new crew did time

24:52.659 --> 24:54.293
with one of the
old guys, right?

24:54.326 --> 24:57.530
Old guys get to bragging about
scores they pulled off, but

24:57.564 --> 24:58.665
never got
caught for.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.232
If the new guy's a good
listener, and takes good notes.

25:00.266 --> 25:02.234
Charlie, isn't there
some sort of social

25:02.268 --> 25:03.435
network analysis you can use?

25:03.469 --> 25:05.872
Figure out where and when
their paths might have crossed?

25:05.905 --> 25:08.240
No, no. Not with two pools

25:08.274 --> 25:10.109
of unknown
variables.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.879
See, the new crew had
to have learned the details

25:12.912 --> 25:15.081
of the old crimes
from the old crews,

25:15.114 --> 25:17.717
but right now, we don't know
enough about either group.

25:17.750 --> 25:21.654
Believe it or not, it's not
unlike, uh, decorator crabs.

25:23.656 --> 25:26.292
A decorator crab
camouflages itself

25:26.325 --> 25:28.928
by collecting tiny bits
of its environment,

25:28.961 --> 25:30.663
and sticking them on its back.

25:30.697 --> 25:34.233
As a result, if you looked at
just the decorator crab alone,

25:34.266 --> 25:35.868
you could get
a pretty good sense

25:35.902 --> 25:37.336
of what its habitat looks like.

25:37.369 --> 25:40.339
Conversely, if you looked
at just the habitat,

25:40.372 --> 25:41.874
you could make
a pretty good guess

25:41.908 --> 25:43.910
as to what the decorator crab
would look like.

25:43.943 --> 25:45.912
And the problem is,
we don't know enough

25:45.945 --> 25:47.747
about the habitat, we don't
know enough about the crab.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.616
There's no way to use one

25:49.649 --> 25:51.183
to make a determination
about the other.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.323
Hey, Bloom?

25:57.356 --> 25:59.291
What now, Granger?

25:59.325 --> 26:01.894
What could there possibly
be left to say?

26:01.928 --> 26:04.196
You're gonna need a
ride back to your car.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.600
Listen, Bloom, for
what it's worth, I know

26:07.634 --> 26:09.201
what it's like
to be the agent on the outside.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.603
Yeah?

26:10.637 --> 26:11.370
I was cuffed, interrogated

26:11.403 --> 26:13.105
and locked up by my own team.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.273
Yeah.

26:14.306 --> 26:15.975
But you cleared your name,
didn't you?

26:16.008 --> 26:17.677
For good or for bad,
it's forgotten.

26:17.710 --> 26:18.711
You know why?

26:18.745 --> 26:20.847
Because up there,
it's all short-term memory.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.915
They only remember
the last thing you did.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.720
Look, I read the paper,
I saw the bank robbery,

26:27.754 --> 26:28.888
I made the connection.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.657
I thought, this is my chance.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.358
Bust the bank crew,

26:32.391 --> 26:34.360
you give them something new
to remember you by?

26:34.393 --> 26:36.696
So, maybe you could just kind of

26:36.729 --> 26:39.131
keep me in the loop here,
you know?

26:39.165 --> 26:40.967
Bloom, you got to let it go.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.935
Listen to me.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.937
The only reason you're
not locked up right now

26:44.971 --> 26:46.272
is because it'd
be bad press.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.775
An ex-agent triggers
a shoot-out

26:48.808 --> 26:50.409
while a dozen current
agents look on?

26:50.442 --> 26:52.278
But I guarantee you,
you mess with this again,

26:52.311 --> 26:53.646
they'll get over
the embarrassment.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.281
Look, I know that I messed up

26:55.314 --> 26:56.749
with the Kevin Oliver case.

26:56.783 --> 26:57.750
I accept that.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.285
But I can't let that

26:59.318 --> 27:01.620
be the last thing I did.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.824
AMITA:
It's all right.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.025
I'm unarmed.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.760
No pen, no pad of paper.

27:07.794 --> 27:08.961
I know.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.296
I've got 'em right here.

27:10.329 --> 27:11.798
You're writing
the letter.

27:13.866 --> 27:16.703
Let me ask
you something.

27:16.736 --> 27:19.071
It has to do with the letter.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.207
Actually, it's more about us.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.142
Okay. You know, there's never
been any question

27:23.175 --> 27:26.012
as to what I was supposed
to do with my life.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.847
I was eight

27:27.880 --> 27:30.082
when they called it destiny

27:30.116 --> 27:31.918
that I would go on

27:31.951 --> 27:34.386
to achieve some level
of academic greatness.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.454
You should be writing this down.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.422
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, wait.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.060
When we met,

27:41.093 --> 27:43.730
I was that math wunderkind
on the rise.

27:43.763 --> 27:45.898
Uh, and

27:45.932 --> 27:47.399
the whole time
we've been together,

27:47.433 --> 27:49.869
you've pretty
much known

27:49.902 --> 27:51.804
what you've signed on for.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.272
Pretty much, right?

27:53.305 --> 27:54.774
(laughs)

27:54.807 --> 27:57.710
So, I guess, uh,

27:57.744 --> 28:00.046
this is a, uh,

28:00.079 --> 28:02.248
"would you
still love me

28:02.281 --> 28:05.351
if..." question.

28:05.384 --> 28:09.121
If the ride turned out
to be something else entirely,

28:09.155 --> 28:12.358
and if I didn't fulfill
the destiny...

28:15.061 --> 28:17.496
Is that why you haven't really
moved into the office?

28:17.529 --> 28:19.832
And why you're so stuck
on this letter?

28:19.866 --> 28:21.768
Because you don't think
you're worthy?

28:21.801 --> 28:22.802
Charlie,

28:22.835 --> 28:25.404
you belong in that office.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.306
You are every bit as talented

28:27.339 --> 28:29.475
as Beiderman or Knox
or any of them.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.377
Trust me.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.480
ALAN: All right, knock it off,
you two.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.949
Charlie, you got visitors.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.021
(door closes)

28:43.222 --> 28:44.490
- Hey.
- Hey, Charlie.

28:44.523 --> 28:45.457
You remember
Roger Bloom?

28:45.491 --> 28:47.894
- Yeah, sure. How you doing?
- How you doing?

28:47.927 --> 28:50.863
So I was thinking he could give
you some help with the case.

28:50.897 --> 28:53.032
Um...

28:53.065 --> 28:55.467
I already have the files.

28:55.501 --> 28:58.070
I know facts that never
made it into the files.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.438
I was the lead agent.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.440
I mean, I'll tell
you right now.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.075
Unless you can
give me suspects...

29:03.109 --> 29:04.243
I can.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.878
All right,
not official suspects.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.047
Just suspicions that I had
working on the case.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.882
COLBY:
Charlie, the fact is,

29:09.916 --> 29:13.119
he has been way out
ahead of us on this one.

29:13.152 --> 29:14.987
What's my brother
going to say about this?

29:15.021 --> 29:16.755
I'll work on Don.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.026
I can help you.

29:21.928 --> 29:22.929
Looks close to the description

29:22.962 --> 29:24.997
of that bank suspect
you guys are looking for.

29:25.031 --> 29:26.833
Didn't want to touch him
till we figured out

29:26.866 --> 29:27.533
whether he was
yours or not.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.274
What do you think?

29:35.307 --> 29:36.575
That's him.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.177
That's right where I tagged him.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.445
My guess is,

29:39.478 --> 29:40.512
whoever dumped him here figured
he wouldn't be found so quick.

29:40.546 --> 29:41.613
Why do you say that?

29:41.647 --> 29:44.516
Building remodel's been stalled
a couple of months.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.585
Contractor just happened to come
by to pick up some equipment.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.187
You guys are lucky.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.588
Luckier than
this guy, anyway.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.990
Thanks.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.524
CHARLIE:
What you're saying

29:52.558 --> 29:55.027
has absolutely
no scientific validity.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.595
So what? We know
that they show

29:56.628 --> 29:59.098
a preference
for targets with easy

29:59.131 --> 30:00.299
ingress
and egress.

30:00.332 --> 30:01.600
CHARLIE:
Right, but their pattern

30:01.633 --> 30:03.335
of behavior is going to change

30:03.369 --> 30:05.537
now that they know
they're being pursued.

30:05.571 --> 30:09.108
Listen, imagine
that you're a mountain goat,

30:09.141 --> 30:11.043
trying to get
to the next peak, and

30:11.077 --> 30:13.079
you know that there is a snow
leopard in the valley below.

30:13.112 --> 30:14.380
A mountain goat?

30:14.413 --> 30:16.515
How about if I imagine
that I'm a bank robber

30:16.548 --> 30:17.850
looking for a target?

30:17.884 --> 30:18.985
Whatever.

30:19.018 --> 30:19.685
ALAN:
Look, look.

30:19.718 --> 30:21.520
Look, you may be coming at this

30:21.553 --> 30:22.889
from two different directions,

30:22.922 --> 30:24.523
but the question
remains the same.

30:24.556 --> 30:27.593
There are nine so-called
perfect crimes in the files

30:27.626 --> 30:29.862
that these guys
have not reenacted yet.

30:29.896 --> 30:30.863
You're right.

30:30.897 --> 30:32.231
But whatever
they choose,

30:32.264 --> 30:34.867
they're looking for
one last big hit.

30:34.901 --> 30:36.568
Well, yeah,
it is likely

30:36.602 --> 30:39.038
that they are going to want
to choose a target

30:39.071 --> 30:40.873
that offers a greater payout.

30:40.907 --> 30:42.174
So, uh, we're in agreement?

30:42.208 --> 30:43.642
(wry laugh)

30:43.675 --> 30:46.178
ALAN:
They're, uh...

30:46.212 --> 30:48.414
they're making progress.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.582
Only reason you're here is
'cause Colby stood up for you.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.084
I want you
to understand that.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.186
We found the point
of convergence.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.587
Everyone that
Roger suspected

30:55.621 --> 30:58.991
in the original crime
did time at Lompoc

30:59.025 --> 31:01.660
at one point or another,
so we're thinking

31:01.693 --> 31:04.563
that someone from the new crew
was incarcerated with them.

31:04.596 --> 31:07.466
So that's how they found out
about the heists?

31:07.499 --> 31:09.601
Yeah. We just can't figure out
where they're gonna hit next.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.137
LAPD just found
the body of a guy

31:11.170 --> 31:13.339
named Billy Devarro, one
of the crew from yesterday.

31:13.372 --> 31:14.506
BLOOM:
Let me guess.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.342
He did a lot of time
at Lompoc, too.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.677
No, but his brother Teddy did.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.612
The guys are on their way
to pick him up now.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.662
DAVID:
We good?

31:36.695 --> 31:38.630
DAVID:
FBI!

31:38.664 --> 31:39.598
We have a warrant!

31:43.002 --> 31:44.971
Clear!

31:45.004 --> 31:46.238
The bathroom's clear.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.208
Clear.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.146
He's cleared out.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.614
LIZ:
It's too late. We missed him.

31:55.647 --> 31:58.951
Take a look at this.

31:58.985 --> 32:01.320
Looks like recon
for their last few jobs.

32:01.353 --> 32:02.588
I don't see anything

32:02.621 --> 32:05.024
that says where
they're going next, though.

32:05.057 --> 32:06.292
All right, that's it.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.593
With Devarro, the pieces fit.

32:07.626 --> 32:10.029
They're going to
recreate the 1981 holdup

32:10.062 --> 32:11.463
at the downtown
Federal Reserve.

32:11.497 --> 32:12.664
Mm, mm, mm.

32:15.001 --> 32:16.402
Oh, come on.
You disagree with me again?

32:16.435 --> 32:19.038
No, I completely agree with you.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.472
Well, then I'm confused.
What's the problem?

32:20.506 --> 32:22.208
Whoever's doing this

32:22.241 --> 32:24.443
is preserving every detail
of the original crimes.

32:24.476 --> 32:28.014
The 1981 heist--
11 people slaughtered.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.393
BLOOM:
All right-- 1981, four men

32:41.427 --> 32:44.096
enter the Federal Reserve
building downtown

32:44.130 --> 32:45.164
before it opens.

32:45.197 --> 32:47.399
There are two
security guards,

32:47.433 --> 32:50.036
eight employees and one of the
employees' wives in the bank.

32:50.069 --> 32:51.670
CHARLIE: Now, the crew used
Periformol,

32:51.703 --> 32:54.673
which is a Vietnam-era
poison gas.

32:54.706 --> 32:56.442
Most likely, they all died

32:56.475 --> 32:58.610
before they even knew that they

32:58.644 --> 33:00.579
- were being robbed.
- BLOOM: Once they got rid

33:00.612 --> 33:03.449
of all their witnesses,
they used magnesium burn bars.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.085
They cut right through
a side wall of the vault.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.753
The take: a little less
than $2 million.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.088
NIKKI:
A Vietnam-era gas?

33:09.121 --> 33:10.589
That has to be inert by now,

33:10.622 --> 33:11.657
if it hasn't all been destroyed.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.592
And all federal vaults
have been fortified since.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.527
Yes, they were,
in direct response

33:15.561 --> 33:16.695
to this robbery.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.264
So, duplicating
the old crime won't work.

33:18.297 --> 33:19.631
It will if they modernize it.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.600
Look, same crime,
21st century tools.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.802
It's consistent with my
anomaly detection scheme.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.305
One of the differences
between the copies

33:26.338 --> 33:27.606
- and the originals...
- You don't use

33:27.639 --> 33:29.041
the magnesium burn bars.

33:29.075 --> 33:30.642
You have a laser cutter, maybe.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.144
All right,
so what about the gas?

33:32.178 --> 33:33.645
I'm thinking Haldite nerve gas.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.347
- Based on what?
- NIKKI: And from where?

33:35.381 --> 33:38.450
The U.S. signed the Chemical
Weapons Convention back in '93.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.552
But there's a facility in
Seal Beach that contracts

33:40.586 --> 33:42.054
with the government,
and they destroy

33:42.088 --> 33:43.089
chemical weapons
collected overseas.

33:43.122 --> 33:44.190
Now, they had
a break-in

33:44.223 --> 33:46.125
six weeks ago.
A security guard

33:46.158 --> 33:47.659
that works there
is being detained right now,

33:47.693 --> 33:49.561
but they still haven't recovered
the Haldite that was taken.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.331
We need to talk
with that security guard.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.533
Six weeks in federal holding,
Marcus.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.468
No visitors, no phone calls.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.470
It sounds like you got nobody.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.639
I don't need nobody, 'cause
I got nothing to say.

34:00.672 --> 34:03.409
Yeah, we heard
you've been real quiet.

34:03.442 --> 34:04.776
But how are you
going to feel

34:04.810 --> 34:06.578
when six weeks turns
into six months

34:06.612 --> 34:08.614
or six years?

34:08.647 --> 34:10.416
Want to hear my guess?

34:10.449 --> 34:12.318
I think you're holding out
for one of those

34:12.351 --> 34:13.652
big paydays
somewhere down the line.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.654
That's why you can
deal with all this:

34:15.687 --> 34:17.323
'cause you know
if you keep quiet

34:17.356 --> 34:19.225
about the gas
and you protect who has it,

34:19.258 --> 34:21.727
you're going to get some big,
uh, cash reward

34:21.760 --> 34:22.861
somewhere in the end.

34:22.894 --> 34:25.164
But here's the wrench
in your plans.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.332
We already know

34:26.365 --> 34:27.699
who has the gas

34:27.733 --> 34:30.736
and what he plans
to do with it.

34:30.769 --> 34:32.538
That's a load
of crap.

34:33.805 --> 34:36.708
You ever play Clue, Marcus?

34:36.742 --> 34:38.610
Oh, I'm going
to guess Teddy Devarro,

34:38.644 --> 34:41.613
in the Federal Reserve
with the Haldite gas.

34:44.816 --> 34:46.152
Looks like I win.

34:46.185 --> 34:49.121
I don't know
how much Teddy promised you.

34:49.155 --> 34:51.157
Marcus, that payday
is not coming.

34:52.658 --> 34:55.394
And if people die from the gas
that you helped steal,

34:55.427 --> 34:57.263
they will put you down.

34:59.898 --> 35:01.367
What do you want?

35:01.400 --> 35:03.802
Tell us where to find Teddy
and the gas.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.676
(low, indistinct chattering)

35:13.912 --> 35:16.248
COLBY:
All right, I see movement.

35:16.282 --> 35:17.283
There's definitely
someone in there.

35:17.316 --> 35:18.850
You try a mass evacuation,

35:18.884 --> 35:20.319
you tip them off,

35:20.352 --> 35:22.354
it could get
very ugly.

35:22.388 --> 35:23.755
Hey, you're just here
to watch, okay?

35:23.789 --> 35:24.690
I'm just saying.

35:24.723 --> 35:25.657
All right, listen up, everyone.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.493
I want to keep SWAT
and Hazmat out of sight.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.295
We're going to clear
the businesses on both sides.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.263
We hit them tonight,
we'll get less people around.

35:31.297 --> 35:32.698
It doesn't look
like much, does it?

35:32.731 --> 35:35.367
Yeah, well, it scares me.

35:42.208 --> 35:44.376
LIZ (over radio):
This one looks empty.

35:44.410 --> 35:45.911
It's all locked up.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.414
DAVID (over radio):
I'm clearing store to the east.

35:50.682 --> 35:51.850
COLBY:
I don't believe it.

35:51.883 --> 35:53.752
Don, there's someone
out front right now.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.354
DON (over radio):
David, Liz, stop.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.256
Stop where you are.

35:58.524 --> 35:59.658
- Open the damn door!
- Run! Go!

35:59.691 --> 36:01.327
We gotta move. Hit it.
Send SWAT in back.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.561
- We're going!
- Stay right here.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.763
DAVID:
Get out the way!

36:04.796 --> 36:08.334
(people shouting)

36:08.367 --> 36:09.401
Door is locked.

36:24.550 --> 36:25.551
(groans)

36:30.021 --> 36:31.490
MAN: Okay, okay, I'm coming out!

36:31.523 --> 36:32.391
Drop the gun!

36:34.360 --> 36:35.794
Nice and easy-- don't move.

36:35.827 --> 36:36.962
Don't move! Come here!

36:36.995 --> 36:38.664
LIZ: Put your hands behind your
back.

36:38.697 --> 36:39.865
Turn around.

36:39.898 --> 36:40.899
Where's Devarro?

36:43.001 --> 36:44.703
DAVID: Where the hell is that
damn canister?

36:44.736 --> 36:45.871
Hey, yo, check this out.

36:45.904 --> 36:46.872
Hey.

36:46.905 --> 36:47.906
It leads up and over.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.645
He is coming out the front.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.314
He's getting away--
he's coming out the front.

36:55.347 --> 36:56.382
Hey.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.417
- No, my baby!
- Shut up!

36:58.450 --> 36:59.451
- Back!
- Please...

36:59.485 --> 37:00.419
- Back up!
- Please, don't.

37:00.452 --> 37:01.186
No, my baby!

37:01.219 --> 37:02.087
- Get back!
- My baby, please!

37:02.120 --> 37:03.922
- Shut up!
- Please don't hurt my baby!

37:03.955 --> 37:05.524
You know what this is,
don't you?

37:05.557 --> 37:06.892
Teddy, you're not
going anywhere.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.794
- No, my baby!
- Somebody,

37:08.827 --> 37:10.362
- Back off!
- help my baby!

37:10.396 --> 37:11.930
DON:
Teddy, put it down!

37:11.963 --> 37:12.864
Back!

37:14.466 --> 37:15.567
Back!
(woman screams)

37:16.502 --> 37:17.102
Put it down!

37:17.135 --> 37:18.837
- My baby!
- Back off!

37:20.071 --> 37:20.939
Shut up!

37:20.972 --> 37:22.007
Get out!

37:22.040 --> 37:22.974
- Get out!
- No!

37:23.008 --> 37:24.443
- Get out now!
- My baby!

37:24.476 --> 37:25.010
(woman screams)

37:25.043 --> 37:26.612
Get out.

37:28.347 --> 37:32.050
(grunting and groaning)

37:32.083 --> 37:33.685
I got it, I got it, I got it.

37:33.719 --> 37:35.687
DON:
Don't move. Don't move!

37:38.724 --> 37:39.791
Okay.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.026
I got it.

37:44.062 --> 37:46.031
(handcuffs clicking)

37:50.736 --> 37:52.638
So, you just don't
listen, huh?

37:52.671 --> 37:54.005
Old habits.

37:54.039 --> 37:56.308
About a thousand ways
that could have gone wrong.

37:56.342 --> 37:58.444
Yeah, but it didn't.

37:58.477 --> 37:59.811
(chuckles)

37:59.845 --> 38:01.747
We got lucky.

38:05.417 --> 38:07.653
That's the best I'm ever going
to get out of Eppes.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.388
He's right, you know.

38:11.457 --> 38:13.592
But I'll tell
you something.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.496
People will be talking
about that one for a long time.

38:17.529 --> 38:19.698
(guitar plays gentle melody)

38:19.731 --> 38:21.967
You know, I gave the Bureau
my whole life.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.835
Never got married,
none of that stuff.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.443
But, man, if I had a son...

38:31.477 --> 38:34.680
* One hand on this wily comet

38:34.713 --> 38:36.982
Thank you very much.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.584
* Take a drink
just to give me some weight *

38:38.617 --> 38:39.985
My pleasure.

38:40.018 --> 38:41.687
* Some uber-man I'd make

38:41.720 --> 38:43.855
Hey, uh, David said there's
a kick-ass pizza place

38:43.889 --> 38:45.557
down the street, so
we're going to go

38:45.591 --> 38:47.759
get something to eat, so
if you want to come...

38:47.793 --> 38:49.094
Yeah, I'm starving.

38:49.127 --> 38:50.929
Actually, I wasn't
talking to you, Granger,

38:50.962 --> 38:53.699
but, uh, I guess you can come,
too, if you want.

38:55.801 --> 38:56.802
What do you say?

38:56.835 --> 38:59.371
I could eat.

38:59.405 --> 39:01.507
* Start with my eyes

39:01.540 --> 39:05.877
* Down so the lines
form a grimacing smile... *

39:05.911 --> 39:08.814
(indistinct radio transmission)

39:11.683 --> 39:12.784
DON:
Dang.

39:12.818 --> 39:14.553
Nice digs.

39:14.586 --> 39:15.854
(chuckling)

39:15.887 --> 39:16.922
Well, I don't
understand.

39:16.955 --> 39:17.789
Dad said it
was like

39:17.823 --> 39:20.526
a disaster, like my room
when I was 15.

39:20.559 --> 39:21.727
He was right, by the way.

39:21.760 --> 39:22.894
Um, no, Amita came by today

39:22.928 --> 39:24.129
and did all this.

39:24.162 --> 39:25.664
It's nice of her.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.966
You've definitely arrived, kid.

39:27.999 --> 39:29.134
Yeah.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.069
I've arrived.

39:31.102 --> 39:34.139
Don't know how long
I'm set to stay.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.876
What are you
talking about?

39:37.909 --> 39:40.111
You've been working for
this your whole life.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.647
Yeah.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.816
My destiny.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.118
What if my future has changed,
you know?

39:47.152 --> 39:49.455
What if it's not
being an academic?

39:50.589 --> 39:52.558
What, you mean the FBI stuff?

39:52.591 --> 39:54.826
You don't seem to have
a problem doing both.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.027
It's become

39:56.061 --> 39:59.130
increasingly difficult for me
to be here in this bubble

39:59.164 --> 40:01.800
lecturing about set theory,

40:01.833 --> 40:04.069
knowing that there
are real lives at risk,

40:04.102 --> 40:08.507
that there are real lives
being lost out there.

40:08.540 --> 40:11.743
You know, Charlie, I've seen
a lot of good agents burn out.

40:12.844 --> 40:13.945
You know, guys
that just

40:13.979 --> 40:14.946
don't want to go home

40:14.980 --> 40:17.082
because they're afraid
they'll miss something.

40:17.115 --> 40:18.116
What is...

40:18.149 --> 40:19.785
(shuts scanner off)

40:21.487 --> 40:23.555
I don't know about the
whole destiny thing.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.591
You've had it pounded
into your head

40:25.624 --> 40:26.658
since you were a kid.

40:26.692 --> 40:27.759
Why don't you just...

40:27.793 --> 40:30.095
do what you want
on any given day?

40:30.128 --> 40:32.097
Okay?

40:32.130 --> 40:34.199
Just live a little.

40:37.636 --> 40:39.905
I don't know.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.741
Yeah, well, I do.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.576
AMITA:
Hey.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.211
Am I interrupting something?

40:46.244 --> 40:48.880
No, I was just, uh,
heading out, actually.

40:48.914 --> 40:50.248
Good.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.683
'Cause I need Charlie.

40:51.717 --> 40:52.951
All right.

40:52.984 --> 40:54.152
Congratulations.

40:54.185 --> 40:56.187
Uh, this is nicer
than my apartment.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.256
See you later.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.258
I'm taking you to dinner.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.993
Mm-mm.

41:02.027 --> 41:03.895
I owe you for fixing up
my office.

41:03.929 --> 41:05.731
No, actually, I owe you.

41:05.764 --> 41:07.566
I screwed something up.

41:08.700 --> 41:09.968
Let's go.

41:10.001 --> 41:11.136
Okay.

41:12.270 --> 41:16.274
* There is a numbness

41:16.307 --> 41:18.009
Where are we going?

41:18.043 --> 41:19.110
Brianni's, and
we're late.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.245
Brianni's, wow.

41:20.278 --> 41:22.648
You must have
really screwed up.

41:22.681 --> 41:25.050
Charlie, um...
the other night,

41:25.083 --> 41:26.818
when we were talking
in the garage

41:26.852 --> 41:28.554
about the letters
and the office,

41:28.587 --> 41:30.656
and, um, you asked me
a question...

41:32.057 --> 41:33.659
The "Would you still
love me if..." thing?

41:33.692 --> 41:35.694
And I went on
and on

41:35.727 --> 41:38.664
about you doubting yourself
and you deserving the office,

41:38.697 --> 41:40.932
which I'm not retracting
or anything,

41:40.966 --> 41:45.103
but I realized that I never
answered your question.

41:47.072 --> 41:48.540
Charlie...

41:48.574 --> 41:51.176
there is no "if."

41:51.209 --> 41:54.713
I love you no matter what.

41:54.746 --> 41:56.615
There aren't any conditions
on that.

42:00.351 --> 42:04.055
* Still to come

42:04.089 --> 42:06.024
* The worst part
and you know it... *

42:06.057 --> 42:07.559
You're amazing, you know that?

42:07.593 --> 42:09.227
(chuckling)

42:10.295 --> 42:11.296
(screaming):
No! No!

42:11.329 --> 42:12.764
Charlie!

42:12.798 --> 42:13.765
No, let go!

42:13.799 --> 42:15.567
No! No!

42:15.601 --> 42:16.935
No, let me go!

42:16.968 --> 42:18.003
No! Charlie,
help me!

42:18.036 --> 42:19.671
- Amita, Amita.
- Charlie!

42:19.705 --> 42:21.873
Let go of me!

42:21.907 --> 42:22.608
No!

42:22.641 --> 42:23.609
No!

42:23.642 --> 42:24.910
AMITA:
Charlie! Charlie...!

42:24.943 --> 42:26.812
(tires squealing)

42:32.050 --> 42:34.252
(song ends)
