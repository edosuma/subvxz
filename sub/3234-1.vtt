<i>[Male Announcer] We interrupt
our scheduled programming</i>

04:14.497 --> 04:15.963
<i>to bring you breaking news.</i>

04:15.997 --> 04:17.230
Good afternoon.

04:17.265 --> 04:18.498
In the last several minutes,

04:18.533 --> 04:20.767
KOB has received dozens of reports

04:20.801 --> 04:23.302
of what appears to be
a crashed aircraft--

04:23.336 --> 04:24.770
possibly two aircraft--

04:24.804 --> 04:26.671
on Albuquerque's east side.

04:26.705 --> 04:28.606
As of yet, details are scarce,

04:28.640 --> 04:31.343
but callers describe witnessing
an explosion overhead,

04:31.377 --> 04:34.313
followed by falling debris.
Visible now toward...

04:34.347 --> 04:37.485
...crash investigators with the
National Transportation Safety Board

04:37.520 --> 04:40.555
are expected on-site as
early as this evening.

04:40.589 --> 04:41.722
But officials warn that,

04:41.756 --> 04:43.690
with a debris field
of this magnitude,

04:43.724 --> 04:45.458
the investigation and the
clean-up may well stretch--

04:45.493 --> 04:47.560
...are now saying
that the Boeing 737

04:47.595 --> 04:49.829
was being re-routed or vectored

04:49.864 --> 04:51.131
through the airspace,

04:51.165 --> 04:52.365
which is standard procedure,

04:52.400 --> 04:54.067
according to a
spokesman for the FAA.

04:54.101 --> 04:57.137
The eight-seat King Air 350

04:57.171 --> 04:58.237
was a charter flight

04:58.271 --> 05:00.205
operating out of
Saint George, Utah,

05:00.239 --> 05:02.006
bound for Amarillo, Texas.

05:02.041 --> 05:03.941
It sounded like hail.

05:03.976 --> 05:05.743
Like heavy hailstones.

05:05.777 --> 05:08.478
It was just, um...

05:08.512 --> 05:10.379
bump-bump-bump all
over the neighborhood.

05:10.414 --> 05:15.245
...indicating that the final
death toll now stands at 167.

05:15.278 --> 05:17.543
<i>..67 muertos--</i>

05:17.578 --> 05:19.578
...167.

05:19.613 --> 05:22.014
This mid-air collision
has left many wondering

05:22.048 --> 05:23.982
how such an accident
could take place

05:24.016 --> 05:25.583
in a system with
so many safeguards.

05:25.618 --> 05:26.818
Allegations continue
that the collision

05:26.852 --> 05:28.686
which brought down Flight 5

05:28.720 --> 05:31.922
was caused by improper
air traffic control.

05:31.956 --> 05:35.291
The bombshell confirmation
out of Oklahoma City today,

05:35.326 --> 05:37.827
as the FAA confirmed,
it was, indeed,

05:37.861 --> 05:40.496
a lone air traffic
controller's fateful mistake...

05:40.530 --> 05:42.932
<i>...que el nombre del hombre
es Donald Margolis.</i>

05:42.966 --> 05:44.800
...is Donald Margolis,

05:44.834 --> 05:47.102
a 19-year veteran of the FAA's

05:47.136 --> 05:50.438
Air Route Traffic Control
Center in Albuquerque.

05:50.472 --> 05:52.640
...Margolis recently
returned to work

05:52.674 --> 05:54.741
after a five-week absence,

05:54.776 --> 05:56.776
which was due to, quote,
a personal loss.

05:56.811 --> 05:58.278
While it's now known

05:58.312 --> 06:00.879
that Margolis had recently
lost a daughter...

06:00.914 --> 06:02.780
<i>[Female Anchor]...to a drug
overdose a month before.</i>

06:02.815 --> 06:06.116
<i>His troubled daughter Jane Margolis,
aged 26,</i>

06:06.150 --> 06:09.584
<i>apparently had a long history
of substance abuse.</i>

06:09.619 --> 06:12.086
<i>And friends of the family say the
death of his only child</i>

06:12.121 --> 06:14.822
<i>hit Margolis particularly hard.</i>

06:14.857 --> 06:17.391
<i>Coming as it did little more
than a month before,</i>

06:17.425 --> 06:19.192
<i>many are questioning the timing</i>

06:19.227 --> 06:21.027
<i>of his return to work,</i>

06:21.061 --> 06:23.261
<i>and are wondering how much
blame truly lies</i>

06:23.295 --> 06:25.929
<i>with those who let this

08:21.303 --> 08:23.701
Where would you like to begin?

08:23.735 --> 08:26.903
I really just need this
quick and easy, you know?

08:26.937 --> 08:31.873
As quick as something
like this can be.

08:31.908 --> 08:33.073
Okay.

08:33.109 --> 08:34.909
Is that mutual?

08:34.943 --> 08:36.577
Does your husband
go along with that?

08:38.578 --> 08:40.113
Does he know?

08:40.147 --> 08:41.381
Well, I mean,

08:41.414 --> 08:43.883
he certainly knows
we're separated, so--

08:43.917 --> 08:45.517
Has he moved out?

08:45.552 --> 08:47.819
We're in the process
of moving him out.

08:47.853 --> 08:48.853
Yeah. Today, hopefully.

08:48.887 --> 08:51.021
And in the meantime, my--

08:51.055 --> 08:53.022
my son and my daughter

08:53.056 --> 08:55.090
and I are staying with my sister.

08:55.124 --> 08:56.725
So you've moved out?

08:56.759 --> 08:59.228
Well, yes, just temporarily,

08:59.262 --> 09:01.062
only so he could get his things.

09:01.097 --> 09:03.532
That was supposed
to happen last week,

09:03.566 --> 09:05.734
but then came the crash, and--

09:05.768 --> 09:06.868
Oh, God.

09:06.903 --> 09:08.270
You weren't one of the-- Right--

09:08.305 --> 09:10.940
Yeah. Right beneath
the flight path.

09:10.974 --> 09:12.277
And, um...

09:12.312 --> 09:15.918
uh, we had debris land in our yard

09:15.953 --> 09:18.322
and all of our neighborhood,
so-- Mmm. Terrible.

09:18.356 --> 09:20.457
Yeah. Apparently, even, um...

09:20.492 --> 09:23.360
you know, parts of bodies,

09:23.394 --> 09:28.065
and so I certainly
couldn't bring myself to--

09:28.099 --> 09:30.567
So awful. I know.

09:30.601 --> 09:33.737
Anyway, I was certainly not ready
to move back, but it's time.

09:33.771 --> 09:35.938
And, um,...

09:35.973 --> 09:38.807
I'm sure we're driving my sister
and her husband up a wall.

09:38.842 --> 09:41.676
Well, you definitely want
to maintain residency

09:41.711 --> 09:42.977
in your actual home.

09:43.012 --> 09:44.946
It just puts you in
a better position

09:44.980 --> 09:46.547
in regards to custody.

09:46.581 --> 09:47.915
Two children, you said?

09:47.949 --> 09:50.016
Yes. Holly here,

09:50.051 --> 09:53.119
and then I have a
son in high school--

09:53.153 --> 09:54.754
Walter Junior.

09:56.956 --> 09:58.252
They need to stay with me.

09:59.486 --> 10:00.753
Okay.

10:00.787 --> 10:01.885
How long have you been married?

10:01.920 --> 10:03.781
Sixteen years.

10:03.816 --> 10:06.383
And it's not an apartment.
It's a house that you live in?

10:06.418 --> 10:08.252
Mm-hmm. Do you own outright?

10:08.286 --> 10:10.887
Do you have a mortgage? Yes.

10:10.921 --> 10:13.222
There's definitely a mortgage.
We have, um...

10:13.256 --> 10:14.890
maybe 15 years on it.

10:14.924 --> 10:18.559
What about other debts or assets?

10:18.593 --> 10:20.561
Do you feel you have
a good understanding

10:20.595 --> 10:22.697
of you and your husband's
financial situation?

10:26.869 --> 10:29.004
Is your husband employed?
You know what? Here's the thing.

10:29.038 --> 10:30.972
I-- I'm really not looking

10:31.006 --> 10:34.608
for any, sort of, uh,
loopholes or-- um--

10:34.643 --> 10:36.076
I don't know-- just-- No.

10:36.111 --> 10:38.045
No loopholes.

10:38.079 --> 10:39.613
I just intend

10:39.647 --> 10:41.047
that every one of my clients

10:41.082 --> 10:43.016
get a full and honest accounting

10:43.050 --> 10:44.617
of what it is they owe

10:44.652 --> 10:47.086
and what it is they own.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.155
To that end, I say

10:49.189 --> 10:50.956
let's leave no stone unturned.

10:53.126 --> 10:57.229
You'd be amazed what I've seen
partners hide from one another.

11:47.904 --> 11:50.072
Listen, I, uh-- You know, well--

11:51.640 --> 11:54.408
It's, uh...time.

12:00.281 --> 12:03.851
The s---tiest week since 9/11,
okay? Bar none.

12:03.885 --> 12:06.019
Yeah, this is it.
Hands down, we're living it.

12:06.054 --> 12:07.320
I mean, I speak with some authority

12:07.355 --> 12:08.688
because we definitely
had some s---ty weeks

12:08.722 --> 12:09.989
in the past few months, you know?

12:10.023 --> 12:11.957

Am I? I am, right? I am.
I know. Look, look.

12:18.197 --> 12:20.831
But this situation between
you and, uh-- uh--

12:20.866 --> 12:22.669
I'm not asking, by the way.

12:22.703 --> 12:24.404
Okay? It's none of my business.

12:24.438 --> 12:26.572
I do not want to get in
the middle of you two.

12:26.607 --> 12:28.340
I'm just saying-- Listen,
listen-- Okay?

12:28.375 --> 12:30.509
You beat a little tactical retreat.

12:30.543 --> 12:31.543
Yeah?

12:31.578 --> 12:32.711
And regroup.

12:32.745 --> 12:34.446
And then-- bong.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.048
You know, absence makes the--

12:44.288 --> 12:47.056
I'm pulling for you,

12:52.828 --> 12:54.529
Whoa, whoa. No heavy lifting.

12:54.563 --> 12:55.696
I got it. No, it's okay.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.064

13:05.272 --> 13:06.839

17:03.924 --> 17:05.858
you know, really--

17:05.893 --> 17:08.829
really hard to concentrate

17:08.863 --> 17:11.999
because of all the horrors,

17:12.032 --> 17:14.701
you know, we perceived.

17:14.736 --> 17:18.037
It just really gets
inside your brain, and--

17:18.071 --> 17:21.137
In college they have
this thing where,

17:21.172 --> 17:23.271
if your roommate kills himself--

17:23.305 --> 17:25.002
like, if you come home

17:25.037 --> 17:27.471
and find him hanging in
the closet or whatever--

17:27.503 --> 17:31.439
it's basically, like,
an automatic "A" for you.

17:31.474 --> 17:35.005
And I just think that that
kind of compassion is--

17:35.040 --> 17:37.038
is something to-- Okay.

17:37.072 --> 17:38.306
Thank you, Barry.

17:38.340 --> 17:39.639
Who wants to go next?

17:41.275 --> 17:42.508
Hmm?

17:42.542 --> 17:43.942
No judgments, guys.

17:43.976 --> 17:45.276
Just feelings.

17:45.310 --> 17:47.876
You can say anything and everything

17:47.911 --> 17:49.377
that's on your mind.

17:49.412 --> 17:50.578
Anyone?

17:54.949 --> 17:56.082
There you go, honey.

17:58.352 --> 18:00.853
I just keep asking myself--

18:00.887 --> 18:03.022
Honey, could you please stand up?

18:06.959 --> 18:09.661
Just keep asking myself,
"Why did this happen?"

18:11.997 --> 18:13.631
I mean, if there's a God and all,

18:13.665 --> 18:15.932
why does he allow all
those innocent people

18:15.967 --> 18:18.632
to die for no reason?

18:18.666 --> 18:21.698
Okay, can we just keep
it secular, honey?

18:21.732 --> 18:24.933
Anyhow, I haven't really
been sleeping much.

18:24.967 --> 18:27.101
Does anyone else have that?

18:29.804 --> 18:32.906
I just keep hearing that-
that sound.

18:34.508 --> 18:36.742
That boom.

18:37.911 --> 18:40.379
It just plays over
and over in my head

18:40.413 --> 18:41.946
like it won't ever stop.

18:46.785 --> 18:48.052
[Woman] Thank you, sweetheart.

18:49.154 --> 18:50.654
Is there anyone else?

18:55.626 --> 18:57.594
Uh-- [clears throat]--

18:57.628 --> 19:01.664
My neighbor, he heard the crash,

19:01.699 --> 19:03.600
and he ran out to his front yard,

19:03.634 --> 19:06.302
and he found, like, this seat--

19:06.337 --> 19:08.471
you know, like, an airline seat.

19:08.505 --> 19:10.473
Like one you have on an airliner?

19:10.507 --> 19:13.076
Well, anyway, the seat was standing

19:13.110 --> 19:15.244
perfectly upright
in his front yard,

19:15.279 --> 19:16.813
right next to his Sea-Doos--

19:16.847 --> 19:18.514
because, like, he has Sea-Doos--

19:18.548 --> 19:20.282
But...

19:20.316 --> 19:22.650
there was still a pair of legs

19:22.685 --> 19:25.386
buckled into them.

19:25.420 --> 19:26.821
Human legs.

19:28.656 --> 19:30.490
J---- H. C-----.

19:33.527 --> 19:34.760
[whispers] You okay?

19:34.795 --> 19:36.595
Yeah. Sorry. I-- um--

19:36.629 --> 19:39.097
I was just moved.

19:41.300 --> 19:43.000
[Woman] Maybe we should
hear from the faculty.

19:43.034 --> 19:45.335
Certainly this tragedy

19:45.369 --> 19:47.570
didn't only affect our students.

19:49.205 --> 19:51.506
Mr. White, would you
like to say something?

19:52.941 --> 19:56.209
And by the way, welcome back. Hmm?

19:56.244 --> 19:58.278
[applause]

20:05.384 --> 20:07.518
It's so good to have you back.

20:11.323 --> 20:13.190
[mutters]

20:20.398 --> 20:21.398
Uh...

20:24.102 --> 20:26.103
I guess what I-- I would--

20:26.137 --> 20:27.638
Sorry. Sorry.

20:31.277 --> 20:35.848
I guess what I would
want to say is...

20:35.882 --> 20:38.918
to look on the bright side.

20:42.522 --> 20:45.723
First of all, nobody on
the ground was killed.

20:45.758 --> 20:49.191
And that-- I mean,
an incident like this

20:49.226 --> 20:52.157
over a populated urban center--

20:52.192 --> 20:55.091
That right there,
that's-- that's just gotta be

20:55.125 --> 20:57.758
some minor miracle, so--

20:57.792 --> 21:01.192
Plus, neither plane was full.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.860
You know, the-- the 737 was--

21:03.894 --> 21:05.061
was what? Uh,

21:05.095 --> 21:06.829
maybe two-thirds full, I believe.

21:06.863 --> 21:07.829
Right? Yes?

21:07.864 --> 21:10.398
Or maybe even three-quarters full.

21:10.432 --> 21:12.867
Well, at any rate,

21:12.901 --> 21:16.771
what you're left
with casualty-wise is

21:16.805 --> 21:19.374
just the 50th worst air disaster.

21:19.408 --> 21:22.514
Actually, tied for 50th.

21:22.548 --> 21:26.286
There are, in truth,

21:26.320 --> 21:31.394
53 crashes throughout history

21:31.428 --> 21:34.334
that are just as bad or worse--

21:34.369 --> 21:35.436
Tenerife?

21:35.472 --> 21:36.772
Has anybody--

21:36.807 --> 21:38.141
anybody hear of Tenerife?

21:38.175 --> 21:40.143
No?

21:40.177 --> 21:45.447
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s

21:45.482 --> 21:47.750
crashed into each
other on Tenerife.

21:47.785 --> 21:52.756
Does anybody know how big a 747 is?

21:52.790 --> 21:54.991
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737.

21:55.026 --> 21:56.293
And we're talking
about two of them.

21:56.327 --> 22:01.098
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.

22:01.132 --> 22:04.334
Doesn't any of you even
remember it at all?

22:04.368 --> 22:06.803
Any of you? I doubt it.

22:06.837 --> 22:07.803
You know why?

22:07.838 --> 22:10.105
It's because...

22:10.140 --> 22:12.641
people move on.

22:14.176 --> 22:16.412
They just move on.
And we will, too.

22:16.446 --> 22:18.983
We will move on,
and we will get past this

22:19.017 --> 22:20.820
because that is what
human beings do.

22:20.855 --> 22:23.291
We survive.

22:23.325 --> 22:26.627
And, uh...

22:26.661 --> 22:28.728
We survive, and-- and we--

22:28.763 --> 22:30.563
we overcome.

22:30.598 --> 22:31.664
Yeah.

22:32.666 --> 22:33.866
We survive.

22:33.900 --> 22:35.334
We survive, and--

22:35.368 --> 22:36.368
Thank you.

22:36.402 --> 22:37.436
Okay.

22:38.504 --> 22:40.771
Thank you. [feedback]

22:40.806 --> 22:41.839
Good.

25:16.145 --> 25:17.144
Well...

25:20.081 --> 25:21.716
Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?

25:24.386 --> 25:27.555
Fine, I guess. Oh.

25:27.589 --> 25:30.291
You make sure you say hello
to her for me, will you?

25:30.325 --> 25:32.693
Why don't you just come inside?

25:32.727 --> 25:33.827
It's your house.

25:35.763 --> 25:36.762
No, I--

25:49.106 --> 25:50.106
[door closes]

25:52.809 --> 25:54.243
[engine starts]

26:12.862 --> 26:14.029
He's gone.

26:18.135 --> 26:19.902
[Marie] Hey, Flynn!

26:21.405 --> 26:23.373
Tricks. It's an expression.

26:23.407 --> 26:24.908
How are you?

26:24.942 --> 26:28.645
Why do you gotta
treat him like this?

26:28.679 --> 26:30.347
Why you gotta be like this?

26:30.381 --> 26:32.148
Why can't you just talk,
even? Hey, hey, hey.

26:32.183 --> 26:33.616
Cool down.

26:33.651 --> 26:35.118
Okay. Okay.

26:47.498 --> 26:49.198
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?

26:51.268 --> 26:53.135
[door slams]

26:53.170 --> 26:54.937
[whispers] Wow.

26:54.971 --> 26:56.739
You know, try not to
hold it against him.

26:56.773 --> 26:57.873
You know, I mean,

26:57.907 --> 27:00.576
the poor kid, he's probably just

27:00.610 --> 27:02.945
dying of curiosity.

27:02.979 --> 27:05.147
You know, and I guess it would be

27:05.181 --> 27:08.349
natural for him to wonder.

27:08.383 --> 27:09.682
I mean, he's probably
just wondering, you know,

27:09.717 --> 27:12.718
what is it that could have
gone so wrong-- Marie.

27:12.753 --> 27:14.687
...that my mother
would leave-- Marie.

27:14.721 --> 27:17.056
I can't help you get
through this, Skyler,

27:17.090 --> 27:19.292
you know, if you won't tell me

27:19.326 --> 27:21.227
what it is that Walt did.
Well, you know what?

27:21.262 --> 27:23.965
I don't-- I don't remember
asking you, all right?

27:23.999 --> 27:25.700
Well, I think that's-
So if you want to be supportive,

27:25.734 --> 27:27.837
...the reason you're stuck.
you could be supportive without prying,

27:27.871 --> 27:29.672
that would be really great-
Prying, okay.

27:29.706 --> 27:32.408
...and so-- Well, prying's a
strong word, but I don't--

27:32.442 --> 27:33.609
...helpful.

27:39.583 --> 27:42.350
[Man] It's that...

27:42.385 --> 27:44.018
voice inside your head.

27:45.620 --> 27:49.756
It's that sneaky,
rat-bastard, 24/7 voice.

27:51.925 --> 27:53.292
You guys know what
I'm talking about.

27:53.326 --> 27:56.596
That voice that tells you
you're not good enough.

27:56.630 --> 28:00.336
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to...

28:00.370 --> 28:02.305
be what, President
of the United States?

28:02.339 --> 28:06.209
Well, okay, so maybe
you're not that good.

28:07.278 --> 28:09.612
But now are you good enough

28:09.646 --> 28:13.115
to deserve your share of
basic human happiness?

28:13.149 --> 28:15.750
Are you good enough to be okay

28:15.785 --> 28:18.220
with who and what you are?

28:18.254 --> 28:20.088
I say yes.

28:24.928 --> 28:26.996
But it doesn't matter what I say.

28:27.030 --> 28:28.664
It's your voice,

28:28.698 --> 28:30.632
which means you're the
only one that hears it,

28:30.667 --> 28:33.268
which means that you're the
only one that can fight it.

28:33.302 --> 28:35.170
Right?

28:35.205 --> 28:37.139
Jesse...

28:37.173 --> 28:38.507
we never hear from you.

28:39.876 --> 28:41.043
What's going on?

28:41.077 --> 28:42.911
You can tell me I'm full of s---.

28:42.946 --> 28:44.880
It's okay. I don't mind.

28:44.914 --> 28:46.915
Just-- Come on.

28:46.950 --> 28:48.150
Let us in on it.

28:55.358 --> 28:59.327
So, like, what makes
you the expert?

28:59.361 --> 29:02.430
I don't think I ever
said I was that.

29:02.464 --> 29:05.032
Yeah, but you're the one
sitting here, right?

29:05.067 --> 29:07.902
Telling us thus and so,

29:07.936 --> 29:12.039
be happy, forgive yourself,
blah, blah, blah.

29:13.274 --> 29:15.009
Have you ever really hurt anybody?

29:16.345 --> 29:19.947
I don't just mean disappointed
your mother or whatever,

29:19.982 --> 29:23.384
but did you...

29:23.418 --> 29:25.553
ever really...

29:25.587 --> 29:27.054
hurt someone?

29:30.025 --> 29:31.492
I killed my daughter.

29:37.899 --> 29:41.101
It was July 18...

29:41.136 --> 29:43.471
which is my birthday.

29:43.505 --> 29:47.374
July 18, 1992.

29:47.409 --> 29:50.210
I was high on cocaine,

29:50.245 --> 29:51.345
and I was drunk.

29:51.379 --> 29:53.113
Cocaine wasn't an issue

29:53.147 --> 29:54.614
because I had bought myself 2 grams

29:54.649 --> 29:56.716
the night before as
a birthday present.

29:56.751 --> 29:57.918
I had plenty left.

29:57.952 --> 30:00.687
But I was out of vodka.

30:00.721 --> 30:02.722
And this is in Portsmouth,
Virginia,

30:02.757 --> 30:06.192
where instead of selling
liquor in the supermarkets,

30:06.227 --> 30:09.462
they have these ABC stores
which close at 5 p.m.

30:09.496 --> 30:13.166
And right then it was, like, 4:42.

30:14.935 --> 30:18.037
So I'm arguing with my wife--

30:18.071 --> 30:20.406
"Come on, go to the ABC for me.

30:20.440 --> 30:22.041
"It's my birthday.

30:22.075 --> 30:24.110
"Come on.

30:24.144 --> 30:26.112
They're not gonna sell it to me."

30:27.881 --> 30:29.649
She's saying, "No, no."

30:31.618 --> 30:34.320
So I'm p---ed,
and the clock is ticking,

30:34.354 --> 30:36.222
so I jump in my truck.

30:37.491 --> 30:38.858
She's--

30:38.892 --> 30:40.493
my 6-year-old daughter...

30:42.495 --> 30:44.696
She's playing at the
end of the driveway.

30:46.933 --> 30:48.000
So...

30:55.241 --> 30:56.908
How do you not hate yourself?

30:58.778 --> 31:00.678
I did hate myself...

31:00.713 --> 31:01.946
for a long time.

31:03.282 --> 31:05.683
But it didn't stop me from...

31:05.718 --> 31:07.619
drinking and getting high.

31:07.653 --> 31:09.521
It just made it that much worse.

31:12.291 --> 31:14.625
Self-hatred, guilt,

31:14.660 --> 31:16.994
it accomplishes nothing.

31:17.029 --> 31:19.464
It just stands in the way.

31:20.732 --> 31:22.366
Stands in the way of what?

31:23.602 --> 31:24.902
True change.

31:43.255 --> 31:44.555
[knocking on door]

31:52.330 --> 31:53.330
[coughs]

31:55.967 --> 31:58.268
Skyler, hi.

31:58.302 --> 31:59.936
Is this a good time to talk?

32:01.339 --> 32:02.973
Yeah. Come in, please.

32:09.647 --> 32:10.914
Skyler.

32:14.351 --> 32:15.818
Um...

32:31.668 --> 32:33.168
Do you want to start?

32:43.580 --> 32:44.646
Okay.

33:05.434 --> 33:07.068
Why-- Why are you doing this?

33:07.102 --> 33:09.304
Why are you even thinking this way?

33:09.338 --> 33:11.673
Is it to punish me?

33:11.707 --> 33:14.108
I am not punishing you, Walt.

33:14.143 --> 33:17.679
This is punitive is what this is.

33:17.713 --> 33:19.080
We are happily married.

33:19.114 --> 33:21.282
[exhales] I am happily married.

33:21.316 --> 33:22.683
I am happy.

33:23.752 --> 33:24.919
We're just--

33:30.992 --> 33:34.328
I love you, Skyler,

33:34.362 --> 33:37.298
and I would do anything for you.

33:39.501 --> 33:42.336
Would you even consider--

33:42.370 --> 33:45.172
I mean, J----!

33:45.206 --> 33:46.373
You come in here,

33:46.407 --> 33:48.842
and you wave these
papers in my face,

33:48.876 --> 33:51.211
when there's a whole other

33:51.245 --> 33:54.148
entire side to this thing.

33:54.182 --> 33:56.150
There's your side,
and there's my side.

33:56.184 --> 33:58.285
And you haven't heard my side yet.

33:58.319 --> 33:59.853
You haven't heard any of it at all.

33:59.887 --> 34:01.255
You're a drug dealer.

34:06.260 --> 34:07.694
No. What-- How--

34:08.862 --> 34:09.862
What?

34:16.270 --> 34:17.904
[inhales, exhales]

34:19.574 --> 34:20.572
Yeah.

34:23.210 --> 34:26.179
How else could you possibly
make that kind of money?

34:30.918 --> 34:32.118
Marijuana.

34:33.821 --> 34:35.255
That Pinkman kid.

34:43.532 --> 34:44.732
No?

34:47.870 --> 34:49.536
Oh, my God, Walt.

34:52.908 --> 34:54.275
Cocaine?

34:58.414 --> 35:00.114
It's methamphetamine.

35:03.052 --> 35:04.586
But I-- I'm--

35:04.620 --> 35:05.954
I manufacture.

35:05.988 --> 35:07.455
I am not a dealer.

35:07.490 --> 35:09.858
Oh.

35:09.893 --> 35:11.760
Per se.

35:11.794 --> 35:14.263
It doesn't-- [gasps]

35:14.297 --> 35:15.698
No, Skyler.

35:15.732 --> 35:17.166
Listen to me, Skyler. No.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.901
Listen. No.

35:18.936 --> 35:20.703
There are a lot of
angles to this, okay?

35:20.737 --> 35:23.839
It's complicated,
all right? So please, let's--

35:23.873 --> 35:25.840
Please, let's just sit back down,

35:25.874 --> 35:27.174
and we'll talk it through.

35:27.209 --> 35:30.443
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.

35:30.477 --> 35:32.277
I won't tell Hank,

35:32.311 --> 35:35.512
and I won't tell your
children or anybody else.

35:35.546 --> 35:37.546
Nobody will hear it from me,

35:37.581 --> 35:40.281
but only if you grant
me this divorce

35:40.316 --> 35:41.582
and stay out of our lives.

35:41.617 --> 35:43.017
No, Skyler. I mean it.

35:44.753 --> 35:47.321
Now let me the h--
out of here before I throw up.

36:22.851 --> 36:24.552
Your windshield's broken.

36:27.490 --> 36:28.957
Yep.

36:35.531 --> 36:39.367
A little friction in
the marriage right now.

36:39.401 --> 36:40.935
Strictly temporary.

36:40.970 --> 36:42.537
We're just--

36:42.571 --> 36:44.072
just taking a little break.

36:46.844 --> 36:48.678
Uh, that's you over there.

36:51.482 --> 36:53.617
Listen, um, money.

36:54.854 --> 36:56.555
Saul has got it for you,

36:56.590 --> 36:58.324
and so as so as you're
feeling better--

36:58.358 --> 36:59.492
I'm better.

37:00.894 --> 37:02.795
You're better.

37:02.830 --> 37:04.597
Really?

37:04.632 --> 37:07.601
What? The rehab? It helped?

37:07.635 --> 37:10.004
Yeah. I'm done using.

37:13.108 --> 37:14.942
That's excellent. That's--

37:16.378 --> 37:17.778
That's very good, Jesse.

37:17.813 --> 37:20.081
Boy-- Very good.

37:22.484 --> 37:23.885
You know, um...

37:26.421 --> 37:28.522
in spite of how bad things got,

37:28.557 --> 37:31.492
it really could be looked at

37:31.526 --> 37:33.427
like a wake-up call for th of us.

37:33.462 --> 37:36.798
I mean, you know, just to get our--

37:36.832 --> 37:38.367
our lives back together again

37:38.401 --> 37:42.138
and on the straight and narrow.

37:45.644 --> 37:48.012
You been following
this airplane crash?

37:49.815 --> 37:51.548
Yeah.

37:51.582 --> 37:54.450
You know it was Jane's dad

37:54.484 --> 37:56.218
who accidentally
crashed them together?

37:56.252 --> 37:58.452
Because he was so torn up?

37:58.486 --> 37:59.952
Okay, look, let me stop you

37:59.986 --> 38:01.553
right there, all right?

38:02.760 --> 38:04.794
You are not responsible for this--

38:04.828 --> 38:07.895
not in any way, shape,
or form, all right?

38:07.930 --> 38:10.530
Now, I-- I am very
up-to-date on this thing,

38:10.565 --> 38:12.864
probably far more than you are,

38:12.898 --> 38:16.565
and there are-- there are
many factors at play there.

38:16.599 --> 38:17.697
Yeah?

38:17.732 --> 38:19.165
For instance,

38:19.199 --> 38:22.997
there's some sort
of collision radar

38:23.032 --> 38:25.864
on the jet that may not
have been working properly.

38:25.898 --> 38:27.797
Now, that's public record.
You can look that up.

38:27.832 --> 38:29.398
And the whole system

38:29.432 --> 38:31.932
is run on-- on 1960s technology.

38:31.966 --> 38:33.600
No.

38:33.634 --> 38:35.999
No, really...

38:36.033 --> 38:37.332
I blame the government.

38:40.233 --> 38:42.167
You either run from things,

38:42.201 --> 38:44.936
or you face them, Mr. White.

38:44.970 --> 38:47.805
And what exactly does that mean?

38:47.839 --> 38:49.039
I learned it in rehab.

38:50.842 --> 38:53.176
It's all about accepting
who you really are.

38:55.212 --> 38:56.912
I accept who I am.

38:56.946 --> 38:58.380
And who are you?

39:00.316 --> 39:01.650
I'm the bad guy.

39:28.403 --> 39:30.704
Is the food to your satisfaction?

39:30.738 --> 39:31.771
Very much.

39:31.806 --> 39:33.706
It's good to see you again.

39:37.878 --> 39:38.878
May I?

39:45.618 --> 39:48.853
I have an offer that I think
will be of interest to you.

39:51.224 --> 39:54.959
I actually am not here to--

39:58.263 --> 40:04.032
I'm here because I owe you
the courtesy and respect

40:04.067 --> 40:06.001
to tell you this personally.

40:09.371 --> 40:10.638
I'm done.

40:12.708 --> 40:15.042
It has nothing to do
with you personally.

40:16.945 --> 40:19.346
I find you extraordinarily
professional,

40:19.380 --> 40:21.548
and I appreciate the
way you do business.

40:21.582 --> 40:24.716
I'm just...

40:24.751 --> 40:26.618
making a change in my life

40:26.652 --> 40:29.787
is what it is, and I'm--

40:29.821 --> 40:33.390
I'm at some-
something of a crossroads.

40:33.424 --> 40:37.793
It has brought me to a realization.

40:41.464 --> 40:43.064
I am not a criminal.

40:46.334 --> 40:48.668
No offense to any people who are.

40:50.004 --> 40:51.104
But...

40:53.807 --> 40:55.207
this is not me.

40:58.210 --> 41:00.844
I'd like you to hear my offer,
notwithstanding.

41:02.914 --> 41:05.081
It won't change my mind. I'm sorry.

41:05.115 --> 41:07.450
$3 million

41:07.484 --> 41:09.518
for three months of your time.

41:12.588 --> 41:14.889
Three months, then out.

41:21.529 --> 41:22.662
3 million?

41:25.865 --> 41:28.933
May I take this as a yes?

41:35.106 --> 41:36.105
[sighs]

41:37.741 --> 41:39.275
I have money.

41:39.309 --> 41:41.676
I have more money than
know how to spend.

41:43.545 --> 41:47.080
What I don't have is my family.

41:48.783 --> 41:50.618
The answer is still no.

41:57.328 --> 41:58.763
Enjoy your meal.

42:05.305 --> 42:06.406
Thank you.

42:30.479 --> 42:33.183
[thumping]

44:04.594 --> 44:07.295
[gunfire]

44:09.965 --> 44:11.599
[gunfire continues]

44:11.633 --> 44:13.301
What the h--- is going on in there?

44:13.335 --> 44:15.002
