00:27.027 --> 00:29.430
My name is Amy Bellafonte.

00:31.465 --> 00:36.770
I didn't used to believe
in monsters, but I do now.

00:36.804 --> 00:40.374
I saw them change everything.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.410
It didn't start with me.

00:42.443 --> 00:45.279
It started
with two lifelong friends

00:45.313 --> 00:47.948
who wanted to make the world
a better place.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.017
This is crazy, pal.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.885
I mean, how many days
we been walking now?

00:51.919 --> 00:53.921
I still can't believe
I gave that punk my watch.

00:53.954 --> 00:56.790
Suits him. Elevates his status.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.093
I don't think he knows
where he's going.

00:59.127 --> 01:01.195
I think we're close.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.731
I think we're lost. Yo!

01:03.764 --> 01:05.399
We almost there yet?

01:05.433 --> 01:08.068
Hey, Fanning, he still doesn't
speak English.

01:08.102 --> 01:10.604
Maybe we can't find your guy
'cause he doesn't exist.

01:10.638 --> 01:13.307
You know, if it's true,
we change the world.

01:13.341 --> 01:15.309
You skeptical, Richards?

01:15.343 --> 01:17.411
Of your magical
250-year-old man?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.214
Who cares what I think?

01:20.248 --> 01:22.583
The DoD and the CDC
believe in you, Lear,

01:22.616 --> 01:24.652
so here we are.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.992
He says your guy's in that cave.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.994
This is as far as he'll take us.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.103
Careful.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.441
Eyes up.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.517
My God.

01:56.550 --> 01:59.019
It's him.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.594
Why the hell is he in a cage?

02:06.627 --> 02:08.329
What's that kid doing?

02:09.363 --> 02:11.765
Is he sick?

02:11.799 --> 02:13.467
Hey, Tim. Tim, no.

02:13.501 --> 02:14.868
Hey, what's going on?

02:16.537 --> 02:18.806
Is he sick?

02:18.839 --> 02:20.308
What's he saying?

02:20.341 --> 02:22.876
Jararaca. Vampire.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.646
Hey, we're doctors. We can help.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.047
Is he sick?

02:27.080 --> 02:29.016
Fanning, get away from the cage!

02:33.020 --> 02:34.488
- Tim!
- Take him down!

02:36.690 --> 02:38.492
Aim for his head!

02:38.526 --> 02:40.628
- He won't stay down!
- Hey!

02:40.661 --> 02:43.797
Move, move!

02:43.831 --> 02:44.798
Tim!

02:44.832 --> 02:47.100
Tim. No.

02:55.209 --> 02:58.178
Dr. Lear thought
his friend was dead.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.814
Jonas.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.217
But death would've been better.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.553
My God.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.621
Tim.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.627
You're alive.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.271
Your neck.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.107
How is this possible?

03:29.377 --> 03:32.780
I don't know.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.883
But I feel amazing, Jonas.

03:35.916 --> 03:39.887
I think we found
what we're looking for.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.291
We're going to change the world.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.726
You're bleeding.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.095
I am?

04:01.609 --> 04:03.944
What they discovered
in that cave

04:03.977 --> 04:06.747
set everything in motion.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.916
Project Noah was born.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.552
Just what the hell
is Project Noah anyway?

04:11.585 --> 04:14.054
What, you boys building
some type of ark?

04:16.357 --> 04:17.958
That him?

04:19.493 --> 04:21.329
Mr. Carter,
we represent a government

04:21.362 --> 04:24.064
medical organization called
Project Noah.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.099
We're on the verge
of an exciting breakthrough

04:26.133 --> 04:28.469
that can improve the lives
of all Americans.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.971
A drug that makes people immune
to disease.

04:31.004 --> 04:34.642
Infectious diseases
like AIDS, Ebola, SARS.

04:34.675 --> 04:37.177
What does this have
to do with me?

04:37.210 --> 04:39.913
In exchange for commuting
your execution,

04:39.947 --> 04:42.916
you have the opportunity
to take part in a drug trial.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.985
You won't be the first, either.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.787
Martin Echols, John Baffes,

04:46.820 --> 04:49.423
a young lady named
Shauna Babcock, all people

04:49.457 --> 04:51.335
who were facing execution,
and now they're in Colorado,

04:51.359 --> 04:52.693
enjoying the scenery.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.595
Are any of those people
you just mentioned

04:54.628 --> 04:58.432
available to speak about their
experience at Project Noah?

04:58.466 --> 05:00.701
You're a murderer on death row.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.136
It doesn't look to me
like you have that many options.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.805
This is a take it
or leave it deal.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.840
How about I leave it, then?

05:06.874 --> 05:10.110
Anthony, of course
you have a choice.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.313
And, yes, this is unusual.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.616
But you're gonna be executed.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.151
That's gonna be the end
of your story.

05:18.185 --> 05:21.555
What I'm offering you instead
is time.

05:21.589 --> 05:25.659
I can give you an ocean of time.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.068
So many things led
to what happened.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.639
It was the perfect storm.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.740
Listen up.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.509
I just got off the phone
with the CDC

05:41.542 --> 05:42.910
and the Department of Defense.

05:42.943 --> 05:46.380
The Chinese avian flu has gone
from outbreak to epidemic.

05:46.414 --> 05:49.583
Now, our intelligence has put
the death toll at 15,000.

05:49.617 --> 05:54.321
It's airborne, it mutates fast,
and there's no vaccine.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.523
What's the incubation period?

05:55.556 --> 05:57.758
12 hours.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.494
You get exposed at breakfast,
you're dead by dinner.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.730
We're looking
at a global pandemic.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.398
How long until that hits
the U.S.?

06:04.432 --> 06:05.709
Three months,
if they can't contain it.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.668
But the CDC think
the work we're doing

06:07.701 --> 06:09.236
is our best hope for a vaccine.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.705
Well, we haven't brought
a subject safely through trial.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.240
I mean,
we're nowhere near ready.

06:13.273 --> 06:14.708
I'm aware of that, Dr. Lear.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.677
So, how do we get ready?

06:16.710 --> 06:19.346
We could try incubating
in mammalian vero cells.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.681
No, that would take too long.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.751
You need extended passaging
with antitryptic activity.

06:23.784 --> 06:27.555
I got something.
Nobody's gonna like it, though.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.390
Yeah, well, I have
a very open mind right now.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.926
Let's go down to the cells.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.795
It'll be easier
to explain there.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.932
Tim Fanning.

06:38.966 --> 06:41.835
Patient zero.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.641
He was 52 when he was infected
in Bolivia three years ago.

06:47.675 --> 06:51.044
The exposure threw his immune
system into hyperdrive.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.047
But after a short period
of accelerated healing,

06:54.081 --> 06:58.251
he declined into this.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.253
He's immune to disease,
but he's also

07:00.287 --> 07:02.298
a lethal bloodsucking monster,
who we are all very careful

07:02.322 --> 07:03.957
not to call a vampire.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.459
Is there a point to this recap?

07:05.493 --> 07:07.495
Setting the table.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.763
Stay with me.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.499
Then came the murderers
John Baffes,

07:11.532 --> 07:14.935
Victor Chavez, Kathy Turrell,
Rupert Sosa.

07:14.968 --> 07:18.071
We attenuated the formula
with each subject.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.642
Each one had a longer period of
good health before the decline,

07:21.675 --> 07:23.410
with less side effects.

07:23.443 --> 07:27.114
Still lethal and ugly as hell,

07:27.147 --> 07:29.182
but we're getting close.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.651
Echols, Martinez.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.286
June Reinhardt,
the white supremacist.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.756
She was delightful.

07:35.789 --> 07:39.459
Then we get to Shauna Babcock.

07:39.493 --> 07:42.462
Subject 11. The best result yet.

07:42.496 --> 07:45.132
She took 28 days to decline.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.367
And when she did,
her vital signs

07:47.400 --> 07:50.103
and appearance remained human.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.806
We exposed her to Ebola,
HIV, measles.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.107
She's immune to all of it.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.509
And she can still
rip your head off

07:55.543 --> 07:57.044
and drink you
like a Jamba Juice.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.880
Well, yes, okay.
Nobody's perfect.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.115
But we're making progress.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.553
It's not just tweaks
to the formula, it's age.

08:05.586 --> 08:09.356
The formula attacks neurons.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.525
Younger people have
more neurons.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.694
The more neurons,
the less severe the decline.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.563
How old is Anthony Carter?

08:15.596 --> 08:17.497
He's 25. Arrives tomorrow.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.709
We should move forward with him,
but he's not young enough.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.368
Don't even say it.

08:21.401 --> 08:23.403
Are you suggesting we try
with a child?

08:23.436 --> 08:25.005
Yes.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.407
Children have billions more
neurons than adults.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.543
A child would come through
with zero side effects.

08:29.577 --> 08:33.513
You wanted a solution.
This is it.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.932
How far did you go?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.236
Six miles, maybe.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.339
How'd you know where I was?

08:59.372 --> 09:03.644
I know where everybody is.
It's my job.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.716
You okay?

09:08.749 --> 09:12.252
I spent all day trying to punch
holes in Pet's research.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.187
But it holds up.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.123
I think he's right.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.859
I can't believe I'm saying this,

09:18.892 --> 09:22.129
but how feasible is it
to find a child?

09:23.396 --> 09:24.932
Can you live with this?

09:24.965 --> 09:27.567
No. It's hideous.

09:27.601 --> 09:31.538
But it's either I live with it
or millions of people die.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.040
Can you find a child?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.042
Can you do that?

09:35.075 --> 09:36.777
Yeah. I can do it.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.479
Just a matter of finding
a kid with no family,

09:39.512 --> 09:41.749
no paper trail
with social services.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.684
Someone no one will miss.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.289
Come on! You got it! You got it!

09:49.322 --> 09:50.590
You got it! You got it!

09:50.624 --> 09:53.293
You got it! You got it!

09:53.326 --> 09:54.570
You gonna let a girl
beat your ass?

09:54.594 --> 09:55.829
Not trying to make you sad,

09:55.863 --> 09:58.398
but I think it's time
for you to lose.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.901
Damn.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.903
Here, have it. You won.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.073
I mean, I had plans
for that money, but whatever.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.107
We got to go.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.410
Where'd you move here from?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.280
Georgia.
Before that, Baton Rouge.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.482
Want to come to our house
for dinner?

10:15.515 --> 10:16.616
My mom won't care.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.518
No, I got to get home, too.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.553
My mom'll get mad
if I miss dinner.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.300
Did you shut down the fryers?

10:24.324 --> 10:25.659
No, let's do that right now.

10:25.693 --> 10:29.797
We're closing.
You got someplace to go?

10:29.830 --> 10:31.965
Your mama doesn't mind you
running around so late?

10:31.999 --> 10:34.134
No, ma'am. She works nights.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.838
I think I'm all good. Thanks.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.476
Copy that, 1-6.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.913
Switching over now.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.383
A 32-year-old female
pronounced dead on the scene

10:50.417 --> 10:52.786
of an apparent drug overdose.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.725
Mommy!

10:57.758 --> 10:59.626
I was ten years old
the night my mama died.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.895
No!

11:01.929 --> 11:04.264
Mommy! Mommy!

11:07.600 --> 11:09.336
That's my mom!

11:10.871 --> 11:11.881
She doesn't have any people?

11:11.905 --> 11:13.306
She said no.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.243
Poor thing. Just her mama.
But you go on.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.586
It's too late
to get social services.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.188
We'll put her in temp foster
for the weekend.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.848
Paperwork can wait till Monday.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.315
I'm the girl from nowhere.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.827
Honey, I need to take
your picture, please.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.018
The one no one will miss.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.520
Come on, sweetie.

11:27.554 --> 11:30.390
That's why they chose me.

11:30.423 --> 11:33.193
My name is Amy Bellafonte.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.195
This is how the world ends.

12:03.456 --> 12:07.194
- What is this place?
- Used to be a hotel.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.529
That's not what I'm asking.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.198
We'll take it from here, Agent.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.266
Mr. Carter, welcome.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.935
We'll show you to your quarters.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.916
You ever wonder what happens
to these homicidal maniacs

12:28.949 --> 12:30.517
once they get in that elevator?

12:33.353 --> 12:34.754
I don't think about it.

12:34.788 --> 12:37.557
- Brad.
- Hey, brother.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.427
- How you doing, bro?
- Good to see you. How's things?

12:40.460 --> 12:43.263
Thanks for the, quick
turnaround on Anthony Carter.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.464
Thank him.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.067
The guy can sell a glass
of water to a drowning man.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.070
He's a good talker.
Got us out of a lot of jams

12:50.103 --> 12:51.271
back in the day.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.681
That's right,
you guys served together.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.741
It was like, special ops, right?

12:54.774 --> 12:55.943
Three tours.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.311
Taught me everything I know.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.148
Do not piss him off.
He's dangerous.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.183
Got another job for you.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.518
This one's a little different.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.933
No problem.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.035
- It's not yours!
- It's mine now, bitch!

13:22.069 --> 13:23.779
- Give me my book!
- Whoa! -Come on, big girl, get up.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.505
- You know it's mine, you hooker!
- Get up!

13:25.538 --> 13:27.716
- That's right, get her! Yeah!
- Amy, get up off that ground.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.344
Some man here to see you.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.714
Come on.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.818
Aw, damn!

13:43.556 --> 13:45.959
Here she is.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.160
Amy Bellafort.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.962
Bellafonte.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.064
My name is Bellafonte.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.233
I'm Agent Doyle. This is...

13:53.266 --> 13:55.969
Brad Wolgast. Hello, Amy.

13:56.003 --> 13:59.639
We understand your mother died.
We're very sorry for your loss.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.474
We have reason to believe that

14:01.508 --> 14:03.510
she may have been exposed
to a disease.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.545
My mom died of an overdose.

14:07.014 --> 14:10.850
We think she was exposed
to a toxin.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.753
The CDC wants you to see
a specialist in Colorado.

14:13.786 --> 14:16.323
How come
there's no social worker?

14:16.356 --> 14:19.993
And how come they
didn't send a lady?

14:20.027 --> 14:22.095
They always send a lady.

14:22.129 --> 14:25.832
I don't know. They just sent us.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.834
We'll have to do.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.104
Amy, pack up
and go with these men.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.540
Move it. Let's go.

14:37.810 --> 14:40.847
Hey, so, can
I get reimbursed for her meals?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.016
I don't get free food
just because I'm a good person.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.884
Seriously?

15:02.135 --> 15:04.804
Hey, give that back!

15:08.775 --> 15:10.777
She's making a break for it.
Come on!

15:34.167 --> 15:35.635
- Help!
- You're okay.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.171
- No! He-Help!
- It's okay.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.140
Help!

15:40.173 --> 15:42.275
Get your hands off that girl!

15:42.309 --> 15:43.776
Where you going with her?

15:43.810 --> 15:46.179
No! No, please...

15:46.213 --> 15:49.316
Drive. Drive!

15:55.788 --> 15:57.424
What are you doing?
Why are we stopping?

15:57.457 --> 15:59.259
Aah! What the hell?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.794
You hit the kid again,
I will shoot you in the face.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.601
Come here.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.738
Come here.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.645
Are you dizzy?

16:18.678 --> 16:20.280
No.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.049
You didn't pass out, did you?

16:22.082 --> 16:23.650
No.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.155
Does that hurt?
Do you need any ice?

16:28.188 --> 16:30.957
I think I'll be okay.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.630
Yeah.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.167
- Did you get her?
- Yeah, but it was a mess.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.045
I counted ten witnesses,
someone called the cops.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.579
- We're a little screwed here.
- Okay, okay,

16:43.603 --> 16:45.238
give me a minute.
I'll make it go away.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.482
Just make your way
out of Memphis.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.974
Switch cars,
you know what to do.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.485
Let's just drop
the girl somewhere. Abort.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.710
This is no good.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.212
No way.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.247
You need to bring her in.
Non-negotiable.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.084
What do you need the kid for?

16:57.117 --> 16:59.186
- Excuse me?
- She's ten years old.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.388
Explain to me
why you need a kid.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.056
You know the people
we work for, Brad.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.126
You can't cross them.
Don't test me.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.772
How you doing back there?

17:26.279 --> 17:28.047
Crap.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.487
All done?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.890
Want to try sitting?

17:41.060 --> 17:43.463
Hey, do me a favor,
try to find a market,

17:43.496 --> 17:44.697
get some ginger ale, saltines,

17:44.731 --> 17:47.134
big cup of ice, too.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.202
What if they don't have
ginger ale?

17:49.236 --> 17:52.105
A clear carbonated drink with
sugar, Doyle. Are you stupid?

17:56.008 --> 17:57.968
Animal crackers. Try to find
some animal crackers.

17:59.612 --> 18:03.049
You get carsick a lot?

18:03.082 --> 18:06.253
I'll tell you what it is,
you can't read in the car.

18:06.286 --> 18:10.157
That's what it is.

18:10.190 --> 18:13.193
Or is it that
I'm being kidnapped?

18:19.166 --> 18:21.067
A Wrinkle in Time.
It's a great book.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.670
You've read it a lot?

18:23.703 --> 18:25.305
Can I have that back, please?

18:25.338 --> 18:27.507
Sure.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.282
When did your mama pass away?

18:35.315 --> 18:38.685
Three days ago.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.621
Stupid crackhead.

18:41.654 --> 18:45.425
Was there a service or anything?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.660
No.

18:47.694 --> 18:50.663
Nobody would've come anyways.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.532
Where are we going?

18:52.565 --> 18:54.367
To the doctor in Colorado.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.703
Make sure you're okay.

18:56.736 --> 19:00.473
You're lying.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.146
Let's buckle you in.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.881
Let's raise the seat up
a little bit here.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.551
That way you can see and the
airbag won't take off your head,

19:11.584 --> 19:13.853
which I think we can both agree,
that would be better.

19:13.886 --> 19:17.023
Hey. Got the, um, stuff.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.192
Amy's gonna take the front seat.

19:19.226 --> 19:22.995
She gets carsick.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.149
He like this song?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.852
Yeah.

19:45.885 --> 19:49.389
Keep hoping he'll respond.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.724
If he's still in there,

19:51.758 --> 19:55.328
- I want to find him.
- I think he is.

19:55.362 --> 19:58.865
I dream about him... a lot.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.702
He tells me things.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.772
Things like what?

20:05.805 --> 20:07.240
He wants to go home.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.043
Says he wants
to take me with him.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.847
It feels so real.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.183
It's not just me, either.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.586
Lot of the guys
are having nightmares.

20:19.619 --> 20:23.290
Are you?

20:23.323 --> 20:25.325
It's just cabin fever, Grey.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.096
I wouldn't read
too much into it.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.313
He can play as much
classic rock as he wants,

20:37.337 --> 20:39.138
that baby boomer is gone.

20:39.171 --> 20:41.641
They all are.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.576
You sure about that?

20:43.610 --> 20:46.779
The MRI shows
no higher brain function. Sure,

20:46.813 --> 20:48.247
they all have
their little quirks.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.583
Baffes taps his feet
like he's dancing.

20:50.617 --> 20:54.120
Martinez paces all day.
Babcock likes to stare at you.

20:54.153 --> 20:55.455
They're just reflexes.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.424
She doesn't stare at me.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.492
Are-are you kidding?

20:59.526 --> 21:01.961
She's making, like, crystal
eye contact with you right now.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.564
That's her thing.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.099
Why was she
on death row, anyway?

21:08.701 --> 21:11.504
Double homicide,
killed her parents.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.973
God, people are terrifying.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.475
Okay.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.944
It's time to feed her.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.388
I just want to slap it,
I want to slap it,

22:01.421 --> 22:03.823
I just want to slap
his hideous, beautiful face.

22:03.856 --> 22:04.957
Um, you mean kiss?

22:04.991 --> 22:05.958
No, I mean slap.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.461
Whoa, you got a...

22:08.495 --> 22:10.329
You just got a text from Lila.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.033
What are you
reading my texts for?

22:14.066 --> 22:17.036
Just popped up. Who's Lila?

22:17.069 --> 22:19.706
- Ex-wife.
- You have an ex-wife?

22:19.739 --> 22:22.308
What other kind
of wife would he have?

22:22.341 --> 22:25.344
You're hilarious, you know that?

22:25.378 --> 22:26.746
What's the text say?

22:26.779 --> 22:28.247
That she's left
several messages,

22:28.280 --> 22:30.349
and she's worried about you.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.088
You're not gonna call her?

22:37.356 --> 22:39.926
No.

22:43.295 --> 22:46.298
- Look.
- Carnival.

22:49.569 --> 22:52.304
Want to check it out?

22:53.440 --> 22:54.741
Let's do it.

22:58.277 --> 23:00.880
Can I, talk to you for a minute?

23:00.913 --> 23:03.049
One second, sweetie.

23:05.785 --> 23:08.354
- Do we have a problem?
- What are you talking about?

23:08.387 --> 23:12.091
I'm talking about the animal
crackers and the front seat

23:12.124 --> 23:14.727
and the letting her use your
tablet and watching YouTube

23:14.761 --> 23:18.965
and now stopping at
a damn carnival. She's cargo!

23:24.471 --> 23:26.873
We're going in. We'll meet back
here in an hour and a half.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.107
Clear?

23:52.999 --> 23:56.769
I don't want to talk
about any of it.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.807
We don't have to talk.

24:13.319 --> 24:15.722
The girl should be here
in a day or two.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.225
A girl.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.262
What's her name?

24:23.295 --> 24:25.498
Amy.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.871
Come here.

24:31.904 --> 24:34.206
You vetted the science.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.143
It's going to work.
She's gonna be okay.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.718
Hey, baby, I missed you.

24:48.187 --> 24:51.357
Have you thought about me,
Clark Richards?

24:51.390 --> 24:52.992
Yes.

24:53.025 --> 24:56.428
Good. 'Cause I think about you
all the time.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.333
You and me,
we're made for each other.

25:01.367 --> 25:04.203
But you shouldn't
have lied to me.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.405
You'll make it up to me later.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.859
You have, like, a goatee

25:26.893 --> 25:28.494
made entirely of sugar
right now. Here.

25:31.631 --> 25:34.466
Unicorn.

25:36.102 --> 25:39.238
What is it with
ten-year-old girls and unicorns?

25:39.271 --> 25:41.440
You probably couldn't
win it anyways.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.242
Hey, hey.

25:43.275 --> 25:46.245
I happen to have a medal in
marksmanship from the academy.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.881
The academy?
How long ago was that?

25:48.915 --> 25:51.050
All right,
we'll take a round here.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.620
You got it.

25:53.653 --> 25:57.023
Amy Bellafonte,
prepare to apologize

25:57.056 --> 25:59.792
for subtly calling me old.

26:02.261 --> 26:06.265
Dang. I want that one.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.767
You need three
to get the unicorn.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.304
- Your turn.
- I can't do that.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.907
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.451
Yes, you can.
Ten years old, how do you know

26:16.475 --> 26:17.653
- what you can and can't do?
- Why in the hell

26:17.677 --> 26:18.721
- would I be able to shoot a gun?
- Would you watch

26:18.745 --> 26:20.055
- your language, by the way?
- My God,

26:20.079 --> 26:21.389
- you swear all the time.
- Why don't you try it...

26:21.413 --> 26:22.424
- Don't you know that?
- Before you actually crap

26:22.448 --> 26:25.451
on the idea?

26:25.484 --> 26:27.086
You can do it.

26:29.756 --> 26:32.959
Come on. Just relax.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.326
There you go.
Are you left-handed?

26:34.360 --> 26:37.463
Okay. You're gonna put it
on this shoulder.

26:37.496 --> 26:38.898
There you go, you got it.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.475
Now you just got
to look through the scope.

26:40.499 --> 26:42.010
All right, now,
I counted a half second

26:42.034 --> 26:43.502
as the first one floated by.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.972
So one floats by,
you go "one and two."

26:46.005 --> 26:48.675
Don't pull the trigger
until the "and," okay?

26:48.708 --> 26:51.410
Just watch a few,
find your rhythm.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.112
Dude,

26:53.145 --> 26:55.447
there's, there's, like,
people waiting, so can we...?

26:55.481 --> 26:58.184
People waiting can suck it.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.486
Deep breath.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.290
When you're ready.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.198
Holy... damn it!

27:12.231 --> 27:14.300
Did you see that? Yes!

27:14.333 --> 27:15.711
Did you see that girl?
Did you see her?

27:15.735 --> 27:17.704
Yeah, go get
your prize, sweetie.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.172
That one.

27:27.546 --> 27:28.715
Hey.

27:28.748 --> 27:31.818
Hey. I finally got you.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.986
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I've-I've just, um...

27:34.020 --> 27:35.621
No, it's fine.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.390
Are you okay?

27:38.424 --> 27:40.526
Eva's birthday's coming up.

27:40.559 --> 27:42.862
It's been three years.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.464
It doesn't get easier, does it?

27:45.497 --> 27:46.733
No.

27:46.766 --> 27:49.501
But I'm okay.

27:49.535 --> 27:53.272
Hey, so David
asked me to marry him.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.676
What'd you say?

27:57.710 --> 27:59.445
I said yes.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.815
I-I feel like I need to move on

28:02.849 --> 28:05.852
and maybe have another baby.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.456
What should I say...
Congratulations?

28:12.691 --> 28:15.061
You could say don't do it.

28:15.094 --> 28:18.397
You could say
you're coming home.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.602
It was a terrible thing
that happened,

28:23.635 --> 28:26.672
but it wasn't your fault.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.275
And if you came home,
I would tell you that

28:29.308 --> 28:32.644
as many times as it took
to make you believe it.

28:33.913 --> 28:37.083
I...

28:37.116 --> 28:39.085
I can't.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.120
I'm sorry.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.321
Okay.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.792
Call me if you need me.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.297
Bye, Brad.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.975
That thing is ridiculous.

29:03.009 --> 29:06.212
No, it's not,
it's freaking awesome.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.280
Are you okay?

29:08.314 --> 29:10.649
Hey.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.118
Should we get going?

29:12.151 --> 29:14.386
Yeah.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.489
I got to hit the head, though.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.591
Mind if I go first?

29:19.625 --> 29:21.593
Yeah.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.599
Why don't you take a seat
over here?

29:27.633 --> 29:30.136
I'll be right back. Don't move.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.327
New plan.

29:55.361 --> 29:58.330
Doyle's not feeling well.
He's gonna stay here.

29:58.364 --> 30:00.299
We're not going to Colorado.
It's a bad place.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.601
- It is?
- Yeah, yeah. The problem is,

30:02.634 --> 30:03.946
there's gonna be some bad guys
looking for us,

30:03.970 --> 30:05.972
so we got to find someplace
safe, which means

30:06.005 --> 30:07.706
you're gonna have to trust me.

30:07.739 --> 30:10.476
- And I know you may not have good reasons...
- Okay.

30:10.509 --> 30:13.112
- Okay?
- Okay.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.823
I trust you. Now let's get
the hell out of here.

30:14.847 --> 30:17.850
- You're sure?
- Let's go.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.886
Give me that thing.
Come on, come on.

30:31.097 --> 30:32.999
Brad Wolgast
earned a Silver Star in 2005

30:33.032 --> 30:34.809
and was credited with 98 kills
in Afghanistan.

30:34.833 --> 30:38.337
This is not the guy
we want going rogue.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.348
- We need this contained.
- He doesn't know anything.

30:40.372 --> 30:42.541
He knows enough
to make him a liability.

30:42.574 --> 30:45.011
Do what you have to do.

30:46.879 --> 30:50.149
I know he's your friend.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.584
Doesn't matter.

31:47.773 --> 31:49.441
Hey, sweetie.

31:49.475 --> 31:51.477
Hi.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.612
Come on. Come on.

32:03.956 --> 32:05.724
What are we doing?

32:05.757 --> 32:07.135
I thought maybe
this was a nice place

32:07.159 --> 32:10.196
for you to say goodbye
to your mama.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.899
It's important.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.934
There should've been a service.

32:19.371 --> 32:22.408
What do you want me to do?

32:22.441 --> 32:24.410
Maybe you can say a memory.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.178
Something nice that she did.

32:26.212 --> 32:28.680
You mean besides being a junkie?

32:28.714 --> 32:31.117
Yeah, I mean
besides being a junkie.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.352
She was your mother.

32:33.385 --> 32:36.355
Anger is poison.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.824
Maybe you can
leave some of it here.

32:42.961 --> 32:46.265
Okay.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.933
One time, for my birthday,

32:47.966 --> 32:50.336
she made a birthday cake
out of doughnut holes

32:50.369 --> 32:54.173
and put whipped cream on top of
it and let me eat it for dinner.

32:54.206 --> 32:57.943
That sounds delicious.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.978
What else?

33:05.884 --> 33:09.855
She let me lay in her bed
and watch TV.

33:12.058 --> 33:15.261
If I ever got scared,
she never yelled at me about it.

33:17.729 --> 33:20.366
I like that a lot.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.503
What else?

33:31.009 --> 33:34.880
S-She said...

33:38.117 --> 33:41.253
that I was the joy of her life.

33:46.425 --> 33:49.428
She said that all the time.

34:18.290 --> 34:21.960
Mr. Carter.
I'm here to do a quick exam.

34:29.135 --> 34:31.137
Your heart and lungs
sound great.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.772
You are going to be
a fantastic addition.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.574
Do you have any questions?

34:35.607 --> 34:37.609
You didn't tell me your name.

34:41.313 --> 34:44.616
Fanning. Dr. Tim Fanning.

34:44.650 --> 34:48.053
Yeah, and...
w-what's gonna happen to me?

34:48.085 --> 34:51.257
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you,
Carter, it's gonna be rough.

34:51.290 --> 34:54.726
Man, you're bleeding.

34:54.760 --> 34:58.797
How embarrassing.

35:00.866 --> 35:04.570
Anyway, it's gonna be bad.

35:04.603 --> 35:08.774
Then it's gonna be really bad
and then it's gonna get worse.

35:08.807 --> 35:12.511
But I'm gonna be with you
the whole time.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.846
And it will get better.

35:14.880 --> 35:18.784
And when it does, brother,

35:18.817 --> 35:20.786
it's gonna be glorious.

35:37.736 --> 35:40.206
A nationwide manhunt
is underway for this man,

35:40.239 --> 35:42.040
Brad Wolgast, in connection
with the abduction

35:42.073 --> 35:44.310
of a ten-year-old
African-American girl.

35:44.343 --> 35:48.113
They were last seen
traveling west from Tennessee.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.957
Police are cautioning drivers
to keep a distance.

35:49.981 --> 35:54.152
They believe
he is armed and dangerous.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.864
Hello?

36:05.897 --> 36:07.866
Lila. Some stuff has come up.

36:07.899 --> 36:10.469
If Richards calls, tell him you
haven't heard from me in months.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.038
- Tell him...
- Hi, Mrs. Ferber.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.974
Riley's incision
isn't opening up,

36:16.007 --> 36:17.709
that's just the healing process.

36:17.743 --> 36:20.212
Keep it covered and dry and
come in for a recheck tomorrow.

36:20.246 --> 36:21.513
He's there, isn't he?

36:21.547 --> 36:25.150
Yeah. That's a possibility.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.985
Tell me you're okay.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.421
Everything is fine.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.557
Is she having
any other symptoms?

36:34.593 --> 36:36.395
That's pretty quick
thinking there, Doc.

36:37.429 --> 36:38.664
The thing on the news

36:38.697 --> 36:40.566
- isn't true.
- Of course not.

36:40.599 --> 36:41.600
How can I help?

36:41.633 --> 36:43.702
He have other men with him?

36:43.735 --> 36:46.872
Um, I'd say...

36:46.905 --> 36:48.940
six days of recovery.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.277
Thought I could
buy myself more time.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.912
Listen, I'm running
out of moves here.

36:53.945 --> 36:56.114
Whatever happens,
just... just know

36:56.147 --> 36:58.149
I'm trying to do
the right thing.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.453
I got to go.

37:01.487 --> 37:04.423
- Mrs. Ferber, wait a minute.
- Lila.

37:04.456 --> 37:08.260
You were right about everything.

37:08.294 --> 37:09.795
I love you.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.066
I never stopped.

37:20.806 --> 37:23.775
Sorry about that.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.210
Patient.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.380
You'll let me know
if you hear from him?

37:30.148 --> 37:33.118
If I can get to him before
the police, maybe I can help.

37:33.151 --> 37:35.120
I'm sure there's an explanation.

37:35.153 --> 37:37.989
He's your friend. Remember that.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.760
It's good to see you, Lila.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.943
Okay.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.579
There you go. Breakfast.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.581
Don't make that a habit.

38:25.804 --> 38:29.207
What's going on?
Why aren't we moving?

38:31.477 --> 38:33.278
I'm gonna surrender.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.447
- No, you can't do this.
- This is not gonna work.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.492
- We can't do this.
- We're not gonna make it across the border.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.951
If I surrender,
we'll be able to get you on TV.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.620
They won't be able to hurt you.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.955
You're leaving me?

38:43.989 --> 38:47.559
This is how it has to be.

38:47.593 --> 38:49.695
The only thing that matters
is that you're safe.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.566
Hey, I want to say something.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.801
Hey.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.404
Your life is important.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.205
You are important.

39:00.238 --> 39:02.408
You're wicked smart and strong

39:02.441 --> 39:06.211
and fast and funny and tough.

39:06.244 --> 39:09.815
You can do anything you want
with your life.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.983
And that is not my opinion.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.085
That is a fact.

39:16.121 --> 39:19.057
Can you hear that, Amy?

39:21.092 --> 39:23.294
Okay.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.365
Okay.

39:27.399 --> 39:30.368
Ready? Can we do this?

39:30.402 --> 39:33.338
- Yeah.
- Okay.

39:41.980 --> 39:45.016
Morning.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.355
Hey, Sheriff, how we doing
with that, reporter?

39:50.388 --> 39:52.090
He's on his way.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.560
Sheriff. The Department
of Defense is on line one.

39:54.593 --> 39:57.896
Really? Well, hell.

40:02.968 --> 40:04.603
We got to get out of here.

40:04.636 --> 40:06.313
I need you to get the keys
for these handcuffs.

40:06.337 --> 40:07.482
- What? I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.441
They're over there.
Behind that desk.

40:09.475 --> 40:11.477
Go.

40:22.588 --> 40:24.289
Nice.

40:24.322 --> 40:26.625
Hey!

40:29.595 --> 40:32.130
What the hell are you doing?
Put your hands up.

40:32.163 --> 40:33.841
Sheriff, listen to me.
We all have to get out of here.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.133
You see those SUVs behind me?

40:35.166 --> 40:36.410
They have some
very bad men inside.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.436
Stay back.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.438
Stay right there.

40:40.472 --> 40:42.240
Hands up. Hands up!

40:42.273 --> 40:44.409
Wait for me. Turn around.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.978
Let's go. Let's go.
Show me the exit. Let's go.

40:47.012 --> 40:50.281
Hurry up. Let's go, to the exit.

40:50.315 --> 40:52.050
Let's go, let's go.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.153
This is your guy.
This is your...

40:55.186 --> 40:57.222
Get down! Put your head down.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.375
Let's go. I need you to stay
right behind me, do you hear me?

41:08.399 --> 41:11.537
- Okay.
- Here we go. Come on.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.708
Okay.

41:16.742 --> 41:17.976
Under this desk. Let's go.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.645
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

41:53.378 --> 41:56.414
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

41:59.417 --> 42:02.387
Brad.

42:02.420 --> 42:04.355
Don't do this.

42:04.389 --> 42:06.725
You gonna shoot me
in front of the girl?

42:10.195 --> 42:12.998
You don't understand
what's happening.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.966
Explain it to me.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.604
I will kill you.

42:18.637 --> 42:20.371
Give me the girl.

42:57.809 --> 42:59.210
You got hit. Are you okay?

42:59.244 --> 43:01.613
I'm okay.

43:01.647 --> 43:04.115
It's gonna be okay. Seat belt.

43:11.022 --> 43:14.392
Hey, look at me.

43:14.425 --> 43:15.694
Look at me!

43:20.832 --> 43:22.567
It's gonna be okay.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.002
You understand?

43:26.037 --> 43:29.775
I'm not gonna leave you,
I promise.

43:31.276 --> 43:32.944
Of everything that happened,

43:32.978 --> 43:35.881
this is the part
I think of the most.

43:37.315 --> 43:39.350
Whatever was coming,

43:39.384 --> 43:41.720
we would face it together.

43:42.988 --> 43:44.622
Seat belt, now.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.635
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH.

44:32.771 --> 44:34.716
You've seen the fight
for humanity on The Passage.

44:34.740 --> 44:37.008
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:39.677 --> 44:41.446
Welcome to the galaxy.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.615
Should be fun. I'll lead.

44:49.387 --> 44:50.722
We're gonna make a run for it.
