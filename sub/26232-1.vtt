12:16.694 --> 12:19.239
Alright.
Why don't we finish this up tomorrow.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.824
This is Officer Geary.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.993
He's going to make sure you get home.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.496
[police radio announcement]

12:26.704 --> 12:28.706
[policemen chattering]

12:32.752 --> 12:34.754
For the record... I'm not yelling.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.381
I don't yell anymore.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.217
We need this in the bag, immediately,

12:39.300 --> 12:42.262
and she was right about your old man.
We got to talk to him.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.180
I'll take care of it.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.224
Can you handle the autopsy?

12:47.892 --> 12:51.479
[captain] Lieutenant. Your father...
His hands are clean on this, right?

12:53.064 --> 12:53.940
Absolutely.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.610
[policemen chattering]

12:57.860 --> 12:59.862
[phone ringing]

12:59.988 --> 13:01.948
[Tony Sr.]
Try to stop me if you've heard this one.

13:02.949 --> 13:06.452
I'm on the job six weeks, right.
Barely out of pajamas.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.746
I'm on foot patrol.
It's a little before midnight.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.498
I clock this beat up Plymouth.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.001
Jersey plates, parked under the bridge.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.127
Trusty flashlight...

13:14.210 --> 13:16.212
I walk over, I rap on the glass.

13:16.671 --> 13:17.714
In the backseat,

13:17.839 --> 13:19.632
there's a girl doing her homework.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.884
In the front seat, there's a kid,
some Jersey punk,

13:21.968 --> 13:24.804
just sitting there, listening to music.
I say to the kid,

13:24.887 --> 13:26.347
"Hey, what are you doing?"

13:26.472 --> 13:27.724
The kid says, "Nothing."

13:27.807 --> 13:30.268
I say, "How old are you?"
He says, "Twenty-three."

13:30.435 --> 13:31.644
I say, "How old is she?"

13:32.061 --> 13:34.897
He says, "In 11 minutes,
she's going to be 18.''

13:34.981 --> 13:37.692
-[all laughing]
-I said, "Good luck, brother.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.776
Go with God."

13:38.985 --> 13:40.987
-[all laughing hard]
-[music playing]

13:41.696 --> 13:43.573
-[man] There we go!
-[Tony Sr.] Look at that.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.241
[man] Stop! Hold it!

13:45.450 --> 13:47.702
[Tony sr.]
Holy mackerel, what are you doing?

13:48.911 --> 13:50.830
[man] Hey, TJ. What are you doing here?

13:52.373 --> 13:53.291
I know that look.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.293
-My son does not approve.
-Of what?

13:55.793 --> 13:57.712
Of anything. Here. Switch.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.756
I'll be back, guys. What's up?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.132
[music playing]

14:01.257 --> 14:04.010
What happened to your pants?
I lost the first two games.

14:06.721 --> 14:07.555
What's up?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.475
I wanted you to hear this from me.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.978
Remember the phone call from this morning?
Body in the park?

14:14.062 --> 14:15.605
-Yeah.
-It was Jack Livingston.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.399
-How?
-It wasn't pretty.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.569
Abducted. Suffocated, drugged, then shot.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.073
I wouldn't have done in that order,
but still...

14:25.198 --> 14:26.032
Jesus, Dad.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.785
What? I'm not going to lie to you,
I've got mixed feelings here.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.119
You caught the case?

14:30.870 --> 14:31.788
Where would you start?

14:32.747 --> 14:34.791
If it was my case... I'd be looking at me.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.876
-I'm serious.
-Who's got a better motive than me?

14:36.959 --> 14:39.045
I spent seven birthdays inside
for that...

14:39.420 --> 14:40.296
that creep.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.175
Alright, for argument's sake,
let's say it wasn't me.

14:44.926 --> 14:47.220
Livingston took five other cops
down with me.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.806
Every one of them said
they'd do him if they could.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.850
-You believe them?
-At the time, but...

14:53.393 --> 14:54.936
you know, the years go by,

14:55.019 --> 14:56.479
and grudges have a way of...

14:57.647 --> 14:58.481
What's the word?

14:58.564 --> 14:59.482
Dissipating.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.944
I heard he was broke.
That he owed the Newmark brothers.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.612
Serious people, but...

15:04.946 --> 15:06.739
But what you describe, you know...

15:06.823 --> 15:08.866
Abducted, drugged, shot, I mean...

15:08.991 --> 15:10.493
<i>Madonna mia. </i>It sounds personal.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.869
Sounds like a vendetta.

15:12.370 --> 15:13.329
You meet the wife?

15:14.247 --> 15:16.040
-Donna?
-Baby... [chuckles]

15:17.041 --> 15:19.252
I hear she's a real people pleaser,
that one.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.212
Half of Brooklyn would like a ride
on that pony.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.883
Look... I've got to win back my pants.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.969
All right? Keep your chin down.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.846
-[music playing]
-[people chattering]

15:33.933 --> 15:36.477
[TJ] My old man was right.
Bookies, cops...

15:36.727 --> 15:37.854
ex-cops, gang-bangers.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.730
The whole borough had it in for this guy.

15:39.856 --> 15:43.067
Lieutenant, Dr. Kornbluth
just posted the autopsy.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.779
I can't see it from here, Ryan.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.490
-Is that better?
-Just read it to me.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.117
Sorry.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.703
Name of deceased, Jack Livingston.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.872
Well nourished, male, Caucasian.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.666
-Weight, 178 pounds--
-Ryan, I just need the headlines.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.126
Time of death?

16:00.376 --> 16:02.670
Between 4 p.m.Saturday
and 4 a.m. Sunday.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.755
That's a pretty big window.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.216
[Ryan] He had eight mls of Nembutol
in his blood.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.051
They jacked him up before they killed him.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.179
Yes, sir. That's my conclusion as well.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.517
COD, acute asphyxia.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.478
That would be the plastic bag.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.563
Then six shots. Nine millimeter,

16:20.646 --> 16:22.315
upper chest, post-mortem.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.275
Six shots...

16:25.234 --> 16:27.195
after he died. Burl?

16:28.112 --> 16:29.447
Doesn't sound accidental.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.616
What did your old man say?

16:32.033 --> 16:33.493
He thinks we should look at the wife.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.078
[Burl] Rings true.
First time I met Donna Livingston,

16:36.162 --> 16:38.414
she was dancing in the club by the airport

16:38.539 --> 16:40.082
and her name was Dorianne.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.876
That was two dead husbands ago.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.128
[something starts beeping loud]

16:44.378 --> 16:45.505
What the hell is that?

16:45.755 --> 16:46.881
It's called Vitalink.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.925
I'm beta testing it for a friend.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.552
It has a built-in skin sensor...

16:52.094 --> 16:53.387
that reads your hydration levels.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.098
It's a watch that tells
you when you're thirsty?

16:57.683 --> 16:58.935
I guess, yeah. Pretty much.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.521
Does it tell you
when you're being a jackass?

17:02.480 --> 17:03.689
The answer is yes.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.275
Just take it off.

17:07.026 --> 17:07.902
Maybe if I...

17:10.488 --> 17:13.115
You know... I could kill you right now,

17:13.449 --> 17:15.451
and not a jury
in the world would convict me.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.745
[reduces beeping by drinking water]

17:17.828 --> 17:19.956
Children, children... Excuse me,

17:22.792 --> 17:24.293
-See?
-We're on the job. Okay?

17:24.418 --> 17:25.294
Let's do the job.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.505
Ryan, pull the phone records.
His and hers.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.632
And make sure the DA's office is
looped in.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.550
Burl...

17:30.841 --> 17:33.094
Start turning these guys over.
Check their alibis.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.804
I need to start clearing this board.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.348
Captain.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.310
Are you okay?

17:42.937 --> 17:45.898
These are the slugs
they just pulled out of Jack Livingston.

17:46.691 --> 17:47.608
The stamped.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.694
They were Department issued.

17:49.777 --> 17:53.155
[Ryan] You're saying a cop did this?
-They were issued to this unit.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.700
To one officer in particular.

18:01.789 --> 18:02.748
Who is it?

18:05.334 --> 18:06.210
It's me.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.425
Lieutenant Caruso.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.678
I need you to surrender your weapon
and follow me.

18:52.840 --> 18:53.841
Detective Caruso,

18:53.924 --> 18:56.302
is there anything you'd like to say
before we start?

18:58.387 --> 18:59.555
There's been a mistake.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.806
I hope you're right, son.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.768
We've got your gun here.
According to ballistics,

19:03.851 --> 19:05.561
this is the weapon
that shot Jack Livingston.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.773
Excuse me, the union doesn't consider
those results definitive.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.775
Lieutenant Caruso has a right
to retest a weapon

19:10.858 --> 19:13.736
-with an independent lab if--
-That won't be necessary.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.571
I'll stipulate the shots came
from my gun.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.573
They let me run the test myself,
just to be sure.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.409
-I'd like to talk to my client privately--
-There's no need for that.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.704
We're all here for the same reason. Right?
We... want to figure this out.

19:23.871 --> 19:24.872
-Exactly.
-Right?

19:25.331 --> 19:26.248
Let's start here.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.710
What possible motive could he have?
He barely knew the victim.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.837
-Family honor.
-Family honor?

19:32.463 --> 19:33.923
Eight years after the trial?

19:34.215 --> 19:35.466
Have you seen his record?

19:35.716 --> 19:37.134
Not one single complaint.

19:37.927 --> 19:41.597
You could eat off of this.
You know what they call him around here?

19:41.806 --> 19:43.432
-"The Choirboy."
-"Nancy Drew."

19:45.685 --> 19:46.894
-Nancy Drew?
-I've heard both.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.604
Doesn't curse, doesn't drink...

19:48.688 --> 19:50.815
Won't take a bag of chips
without paying.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.900
And most cops I know
refuse to work with him,

19:52.983 --> 19:54.443
he's such a pain in the ass.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.779
-Thank you, Brian.
-We'll stipulate.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.239
It's an admirable record.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.741
Lieutenant, let's talk about the weapon.
When was it issued?

20:00.991 --> 20:02.785
Five years ago.
The same day I got my shield.

20:02.868 --> 20:03.911
You keep it with you?

20:03.994 --> 20:05.746
-24/7.
-You ever loan it to anyone?

20:05.955 --> 20:06.789
Of course not.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.791
Ever lose track of it for an hour?
It happens.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.376
Not to me.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.627
TJ, you said 24/7.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.129
That's not really possible.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.296
When you shower?

20:14.547 --> 20:17.049
It's the counter next to the sink.
It's never out of my sight.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.009
-You've got to sleep.
-It's next to the bed.

20:19.093 --> 20:20.845
In the nightstand, in the top drawer.

20:20.928 --> 20:24.306
So in theory, somebody could have taken it
while you were sleeping

20:24.390 --> 20:26.058
and returned it two hours later.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.061
You live with your father, don't you?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.230
[policemen chattering]

20:42.867 --> 20:44.076
Help me, Rhonda.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.044
Caruso, I've been looking for you.
Did they take your badge?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.129
Modified duty.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.465
I'm riding my desk
pending a departmental review?

20:58.674 --> 21:00.217
I have to meet somebody. So...

21:01.594 --> 21:03.304
I just wanted to look you in the eye.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.681
I can handle being wrong.
I've been wrong before.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.642
-But I have to know.
-I don't know what happened, Cora..

21:08.893 --> 21:11.312
-There's nobody else here.
-I don't know what happened.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.607
I have been vouching for your father.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.901
-I put my ass on the line--
-I know you have.

21:17.151 --> 21:20.237
My CO wants him back inside,
but I have been vouching for him.

21:20.613 --> 21:24.116
Because I trust my gut. I like him.
I think he has a good heart.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.619
What makes you say that?

21:27.745 --> 21:28.996
You. He raised you.

21:31.165 --> 21:33.834
If it was him,
if he really did this thing...

21:36.253 --> 21:38.297
I've never been wronger about anybody.

21:41.133 --> 21:41.967
Me too.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.660
[car alarm activated]

$10,000 REWARD

CONNIE CARUSO VICTIM OF HIT-AND-RUN
NOVEMBER 20 7:35 AM

22:18.879 --> 22:22.758
POLICE ARE SEEKING DRIVER OF YELLOW VAN
PLEASE CALL LT. T.J. CARUSO

22:24.093 --> 22:25.261
Been here all morning?

22:32.142 --> 22:33.227
Four years tomorrow.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.606
You've got to tape them to the pole, Dad.

22:37.731 --> 22:38.691
They'll blow away.

22:38.774 --> 22:39.608
Let them go.

22:40.401 --> 22:43.404
She never liked getting flowers.
She hated watching them die.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.450
How many people live there?
Three hundred?

22:49.535 --> 22:52.746
-[TJ] Maybe more.
-[Tony Sr.] And nobody saw anything...

22:53.080 --> 22:54.456
or heard anything.

22:54.748 --> 22:55.958
It was after midnight.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.502
He dragged her 50 feet.
He never even slowed down.

22:58.627 --> 23:01.046
I never stop looking, Dad. You know that.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.757
He better pray you find him before I do.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.012
Dad, we have to talk.

23:08.512 --> 23:09.555
Can we go somewhere?

23:09.847 --> 23:10.890
We are somewhere.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.224
What's up?

23:15.269 --> 23:16.312
Jack Livingston...

23:17.187 --> 23:18.939
was killed with my gun.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.025
Your Glock.

23:21.775 --> 23:22.860
That's not possible.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.154
It's more than possible,
it's a statement of fact.

23:26.447 --> 23:29.033
Well, let me ask around.
I still got some chips out there.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.952
You can't ask around, Dad.
They're looking at you.

23:32.912 --> 23:33.996
Who's looking at me?

23:34.163 --> 23:35.956
You threatened him... in public...

23:36.081 --> 23:38.208
-I say things.
-...on multiple occasions.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.544
I say a lot of things.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.255
Wait a minute. Is this for real?

23:44.089 --> 23:45.257
Are you looking at me?

23:46.508 --> 23:48.636
Who am I talking to here,
you or the badge?

23:48.719 --> 23:49.720
I am the badge.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.931
Let's be very careful then, Anthony.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.225
Let's not say something
we're going to regret.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.436
I've had some people tuned up.

23:57.561 --> 23:58.896
-Dad.
-Let me talk.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.234
Maybe I tuned up some people myself.
I don't deny that.

24:05.778 --> 24:06.987
But I never crossed the line.

24:07.071 --> 24:08.697
I never killed nobody.
You know that.

24:09.323 --> 24:11.033
Here's what I know. Okay?

24:11.825 --> 24:14.036
Jack Livingston was killed
sometime on Saturday

24:14.119 --> 24:15.704
with my gun. My gun...

24:16.163 --> 24:18.624
which is never out of my sight
except while I sleep.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.502
It's all about access, Dad.
The front door was locked.

24:21.585 --> 24:22.962
The back door was locked.

24:23.045 --> 24:25.297
The only two people in the house
were you and me.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.180
[police men chattering]

24:37.017 --> 24:39.728
-[phone ringing]
-[gadjet starts beeping loud]

25:12.678 --> 25:14.680
[chair grinds]

25:17.933 --> 25:19.309
Not cool, man.

25:29.153 --> 25:30.654
[Cora] You can't avoid it forever.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.116
What's that?

25:34.908 --> 25:35.909
Going home.

25:37.828 --> 25:39.747
[laughs] You should be a detective.

25:39.830 --> 25:40.664
Yeah?

25:41.165 --> 25:42.374
I'm thinking about it.

25:43.459 --> 25:47.087
There's an exam in three weeks.
If you can do it, how hard can it be?

25:50.299 --> 25:53.719
And then there were two.
You're going to have to testify.

25:54.762 --> 25:55.637
I am aware.

25:56.972 --> 26:00.225
-[Cora nods asking if he wants wine]
-No.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.564
A swear jar?

26:06.732 --> 26:09.735
That's... [TJ chuckles]

26:10.110 --> 26:11.570
It's just to remind the guys.

26:11.653 --> 26:14.406
You know, we get...
taxpayers in here, civilians...

26:15.824 --> 26:18.077
A swear jar in the squad room.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.204
I bet you don't pee in the shower.

26:20.287 --> 26:23.499
[TJ laughs] Would you like me to?
Would that make you happy?

26:24.583 --> 26:25.501
It might.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.669
[both laugh]

26:34.843 --> 26:36.845
[Cora swallows some wine]

26:37.763 --> 26:40.933
[Tj takes deep breath]
So, how was your childhood?

26:41.850 --> 26:42.851
I didn't have one.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.603
Thanks for asking.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.313
How was yours?

26:47.689 --> 26:49.024
Outstanding. [laughs]

26:49.233 --> 26:52.277
Anything we needed, anything we wanted,
the old man took care of it.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.321
Tony "The Tiger" Caruso.

26:55.197 --> 26:57.199
House in Florida. New car every year.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.659
Seats behind the dugout.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.537
And you never suspected?

27:03.372 --> 27:04.289
I didn't ask.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.167
You were afraid to ask.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.714
[Cora]
They don't wash off easily, do they?

27:15.008 --> 27:15.968
What's that?

27:16.176 --> 27:17.553
The sins of the father.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.027
You still up?

27:34.653 --> 27:35.612
I was worried.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.824
About who? You or me?

27:42.786 --> 27:43.996
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.208
Hey. Come here.

27:49.251 --> 27:50.085
Come here.

27:51.253 --> 27:52.087
Come on.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.590
That a boy.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.217
[tapping him to see if he is wired]

28:08.896 --> 28:10.856
There's some tortellini
in the refrigerator.

28:12.107 --> 28:12.983
I'm good.

28:14.067 --> 28:14.902
I love you, son.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.737
[sighs] I love you, too.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.827
[policemen chattering]

28:52.940 --> 28:54.942
[sighs]

28:55.275 --> 28:56.610
What are you doing here?

28:56.818 --> 28:59.196
I had to show up.
How would it look if I didn't?

28:59.279 --> 29:01.281
Like you have an ounce of common sense.

29:01.573 --> 29:05.035
Donna is on the warpath.
She's threatening to call <i>The Post.</i>

29:05.452 --> 29:06.453
What does she want?

29:06.536 --> 29:08.789
She wants an arrest, yesterday.

29:09.498 --> 29:12.000
-My father?
-Or you, or both.

29:12.459 --> 29:13.961
She doesn't seem particular.

29:14.628 --> 29:17.089
Just stay out of the way.
Stay in the bathroom.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.051
[dog barks and growls]

29:24.471 --> 29:25.305
Hello.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.099
[girl] Maisie, stop it.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.226
Sorry about that.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.895
She's like that with everybody.
Until she gets to know you.

29:32.688 --> 29:35.190
Maisie. Come.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.276
[dog continues growling]

29:37.484 --> 29:39.987
-[piano music playing]
-[guest chattering]

29:59.298 --> 30:00.132
How you doing?

30:03.927 --> 30:04.845
Okay.

30:06.638 --> 30:07.889
I still don't get it.

30:08.849 --> 30:11.059
Back in the day, before he broke bad,

30:11.351 --> 30:13.312
Big Tony was a first-rate detective.

30:13.895 --> 30:17.107
There used to be a line of cops
outside his office every morning,

30:17.232 --> 30:19.192
waiting to run their cases past him.

30:19.276 --> 30:20.277
I was one of them.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.196
So why would he use his son's gun?

30:24.698 --> 30:26.908
He knew that we would trace it
back to that house.

30:26.992 --> 30:29.911
-It doesn't make sense.
-A lot of things don't make sense.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.247
Why are nickels bigger than dimes?

30:33.665 --> 30:34.666
That's a good point.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.794
Why does Hawaii have
an interstate highway?

30:39.463 --> 30:40.839
Another excellent question.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.050
Why doesn't Tarzan have a beard?

30:45.969 --> 30:47.846
I don't know. I couldn't say.

30:48.013 --> 30:50.349
Why did The Flintstones
celebrate Christmas?

30:51.975 --> 30:53.143
When are you retiring?

30:53.602 --> 30:55.395
Four hundred and seventy four days.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.689
Does that include today?

30:58.857 --> 30:59.816
Yes, it does.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.365
You know, I've never been up this way.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.367
-It's really nice.
-Yes.

31:08.617 --> 31:11.953
When Jack and Donna first moved in,
it was all wooded.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.339
Hey, Maisie.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.049
Hi, sweetheart.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.260
I missed you, too. [chuckles]

31:32.474 --> 31:33.809
[Chet] Will you excuse me?

31:47.739 --> 31:49.991
What are you doing?
You said we should wait.

31:50.075 --> 31:52.411
-I don't want to wait.
-[chuckles] Do--

31:53.078 --> 31:53.912
Caruso.

31:54.663 --> 31:55.580
Knock, knock.

31:55.872 --> 31:56.915
Are you lost?

31:58.375 --> 32:02.504
I was lost, but...
I'm not quite as lost as I was.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.382
Donna here is an old friend.
She needed to talk.

32:05.757 --> 32:06.591
Obviously.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.218
[Chet huffs and puffs]

32:08.301 --> 32:10.887
You okay, Sergeant?
You've been scratching that leg all night.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.933
-It's just some sort of rash.
-From here it looks like...

32:15.600 --> 32:17.227
-poison sumac.
-TJ.

32:17.394 --> 32:18.228
Burl!

32:18.478 --> 32:20.730
-Is the Captain still here?
-She sent me to find you.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.487
He's the guy. They're in it together.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.282
I don't know how they did it.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.575
But they did it. [laughs]

32:31.658 --> 32:34.578
You think about it, makes perfect sense.
He didn't say he was in the house.

32:34.661 --> 32:35.495
No, TJ.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.664
Remember the poison sumac
out in the clearing?

32:37.789 --> 32:39.958
Check his right leg.
We can match it in the lab.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.793
-TJ, it's over.
-We can run it through--

32:41.918 --> 32:42.752
It's over.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.089
-What's over?
-The case.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.008
They're closing it out.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.385
Your father just confessed.

32:58.852 --> 33:02.355
You don't remember Harry Corkrin?
[Tony Sr. laughs] "Horse-shoe Harry".

33:02.647 --> 33:04.357
He's practically your godfather.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.486
He's two cells down from me.
I'm telling you

33:07.569 --> 33:10.197
I've got more friends in here
than I do outside, kid.

33:11.656 --> 33:12.741
You can't smoke in here.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.327
No, you can smoke in here.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.830
Plus. I'm eating better.

33:19.581 --> 33:22.125
I don't have to listen to your <i>verkakte</i>
<i>bossa nova.</i>

33:23.668 --> 33:27.297
[puffs] Don't worry about me, kid.
The devil takes care of his own.

33:28.048 --> 33:29.549
You didn't answer my question.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.385
Why did you sign that statement?

33:34.262 --> 33:35.180
Because I did it.

33:35.263 --> 33:36.806
-I killed him.
-No, you didn't.

33:38.725 --> 33:41.102
[sighs] You're a good cop, TJ.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.438
But you're not a father.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.525
I'd take a bullet for you.
Don't you know that?

33:47.692 --> 33:48.610
Not in the gut.

33:49.486 --> 33:52.197
In the leg, maybe.
You know, a flesh wound. The thigh.

33:52.531 --> 33:53.823
You think I did this?

33:54.533 --> 33:56.618
-You think you're protecting me?
-Hey--

33:56.701 --> 33:57.744
I didn't kill anybody.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.704
Of course you didn't.

34:08.338 --> 34:09.172
On Mom.

34:09.881 --> 34:10.840
I swear it on Mom.

34:11.633 --> 34:12.592
It wasn't me.

34:22.727 --> 34:23.687
It wasn't me.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.063
That's what I'm saying,

34:25.564 --> 34:28.441
-it was Chet Finch.
-Finch?

34:28.525 --> 34:30.443
And Livingston's wife.
They planned it together.

34:31.945 --> 34:32.821
With your gun?

34:33.363 --> 34:34.197
How?

34:36.741 --> 34:37.576
Kid.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.160
It's not possible.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.877
[car alarm deactivated]

35:14.279 --> 35:16.281
[sucks from straw]

35:20.869 --> 35:23.079
[sighs] Olives.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.040
I did not order olives.

36:23.348 --> 36:24.432
What couldn't wait?

36:24.683 --> 36:25.600
Seatbelt.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.853
-Okay.
-I need someone to tell me if I'm crazy.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.564
You're not crazy, Caruso.

36:31.648 --> 36:33.817
You're just rebelling against
a father who you love,

36:33.900 --> 36:35.819
but... could never trust or count on--

36:35.902 --> 36:38.655
No, Cora. Not me, the case.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.575
-I think I know who shot Jack Livingston.
-Who was it?

36:43.368 --> 36:44.369
I think it was me.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.830
I shot him, but...
I didn't know I shot him.

36:48.289 --> 36:49.791
Ask me if you're crazy again.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.042
It was a set up.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.044
It was brilliant, a work of art.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.839
I brought the case file.
It's all in there.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.758
It was Finch and Donna Livingston.

36:58.967 --> 36:59.926
They jacked him up.

37:00.135 --> 37:02.387
[Jack gasps and grunts]

37:02.637 --> 37:03.930
[TJ] At some point that day,

37:04.013 --> 37:05.724
they killed him with trash bag.
Suffocation.

37:05.807 --> 37:07.434
Then... this is the brilliant part.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.519
They brought the body to Rodman's Neck.

37:09.853 --> 37:11.771
A training facility in the Bronx.

37:11.855 --> 37:13.982
We go there once a year
to get re-certified.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.192
So Finch, he's the on-site supervisor.

37:16.359 --> 37:19.446
He knew I was scheduled
to shoot that day at 5:30.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.285
[gunshots]

37:39.632 --> 37:41.092
[Cora] So you killed him?

37:41.426 --> 37:42.886
No, no, no...

37:42.969 --> 37:45.013
He was dead already. Remember?
Thank God.

37:45.972 --> 37:47.432
How did you figure all this?

37:47.515 --> 37:49.392
I knew the cluster pattern
looked familiar.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.853
You remembered your pattern
of bullet holes from a week ago?

37:52.520 --> 37:55.690
Yeah, it's a distinctive pattern.
It looks like a constellation.

37:55.857 --> 37:56.816
What constellation?

37:57.984 --> 37:59.402
-Ursa Minor?
-Ursa Minor.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.363
-Who thinks like this?
-Excuse me, I have a plan.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.782
You wanna know where we're going?

38:03.865 --> 38:06.576
To Professor Xavier's mansion
to pick up the other mutants?

38:07.410 --> 38:08.328
That's right.

38:08.536 --> 38:11.498
To Professor Xavier's mansion
to pick up the other mutants.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.130
[door lock beeping]

38:24.886 --> 38:25.762
FIRING RANGE OFFICE

38:30.683 --> 38:33.895
-What if they threw it out?
-No, they keep the targets for two weeks,

38:33.978 --> 38:35.772
in case there's a dispute
about the score.

38:36.272 --> 38:37.190
They're back here.

38:40.860 --> 38:45.073
[Cora drinks refreshment
and crashes plastic bottle]

38:45.615 --> 38:47.659
-Is this bothering you?
-Yes it is.

38:48.034 --> 38:48.868
Good.

38:51.830 --> 38:52.872
Recycle that.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.381
November 18th, Caruso, Jr.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.008
Nine eighty-two.

39:05.718 --> 39:06.719
It's a range record.

39:08.221 --> 39:09.222
Okay, big shot.

39:13.017 --> 39:13.935
Is that all we need?

39:14.435 --> 39:16.646
It's more than enough.
It's incontrovertible.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.193
Don't take it. Chain of evidence. We'll
come back tomorrow with a warrant.

39:22.735 --> 39:23.570
Right.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.033
Were you serious
about taking the written exam?

39:29.701 --> 39:30.535
Are you hiring?

39:31.494 --> 39:33.997
We've been short-handed for a year.
I could talk to the Captain.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.916
[Chet] Hold it right there. Right there.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.461
First your phones. Let's drop them.

39:44.841 --> 39:47.594
You don't have to do this, Chet.
You're not a murderer.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.596
He is a murderer.
That's why we're here.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.222
Now your guns. You first.

39:52.765 --> 39:53.600
I forgot.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.852
You don't have one.
It's in the evidence room.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.896
It is, after all, the murder weapon.

39:58.563 --> 39:59.564
Inspector?

40:00.398 --> 40:01.357
I left it at home.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.943
Why would you do that?
You're on the job.

40:05.278 --> 40:07.947
When he called, all he said
was he wanted to see me.

40:08.031 --> 40:10.658
-I thought he was asking me out.
-Really?

40:10.742 --> 40:13.202
I thought I covered every angle.
How'd you figure it out?

40:13.286 --> 40:15.455
He remembered the pattern
of the bullet holes.

40:15.872 --> 40:18.875
From one target, a week ago?
That's not possible.

40:20.376 --> 40:21.628
It's a unique pattern. It's--

40:21.711 --> 40:23.880
It's the constellation, Ursa Minor.

40:24.005 --> 40:26.424
-You really think I was asking you out?
-No, sorry.

40:26.507 --> 40:29.135
-[gunshots]
-Run! Go that way! Stay to the left.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.021
I'll go around.

40:51.157 --> 40:53.242
-[plywood with image appears]
-[Cora shoots]

41:04.796 --> 41:05.630
Give me the gun.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.632
-I got it.
-Give it to me.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.468
-Why, because you're a guy?
-Yeah, because I'm a guy.

41:13.429 --> 41:14.389
How many rounds?

41:14.472 --> 41:16.474
-[both pant]
-[checks if it's loaded]

41:16.724 --> 41:17.558
One.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.268
-Make it count.
-You think?

41:31.781 --> 41:35.243
[TJ pulls the trigger,
but gun doesn't fire]

41:35.660 --> 41:36.494
Empty.

41:45.712 --> 41:47.171
-[gunshot]
-[Chet grunts]

41:51.634 --> 41:55.888
-[TJ kicks gun away]
-[Chet groans and pants]

41:56.389 --> 41:57.348
How?

41:57.598 --> 41:59.600
[TJ pants]

41:59.684 --> 42:01.894
[shows Chet how he immitated empty gun]

42:01.978 --> 42:03.104
[Chet huffs and puffs]

42:03.563 --> 42:04.731
It's annoying isn't it?

42:05.189 --> 42:06.482
[Cora laughs]

42:09.819 --> 42:10.987
<i>An arraignment is scheduled</i>

42:11.070 --> 42:12.822
<i>for tomorrow morning at Superior Court.</i>

42:12.905 --> 42:14.741
<i>Both Sergeant Chet Finch</i>
<i>and the victim's widow</i>

42:14.824 --> 42:17.785
<i>will be charged with conspiracy,</i>
<i>and aggravated homicide.</i>

42:17.869 --> 42:20.329
[Tony Sr.]
Well, I guess I'd better start packing.

42:20.455 --> 42:22.623
You boys behave yourselves.
[claps hands]

42:26.085 --> 42:28.880
POLICE DETECTIVE
PRACTICE EXAMINATION

42:35.678 --> 42:37.680
[people chattering]

43:01.662 --> 43:04.665
[laughs] Hey. [grunts]

43:09.253 --> 43:10.379
[sighs]

43:11.631 --> 43:12.507
Hey.

43:15.259 --> 43:16.803
You know, this never gets old.

43:17.261 --> 43:18.179
What's that?

43:18.679 --> 43:20.932
Me getting sprung, you driving me home.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.768
One of my favorite father son activities.

43:23.851 --> 43:25.603
-Get in the car.
-[Tony Sr. laughs]

43:26.729 --> 43:27.730
Let's eat.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.114
It's the same light.

43:39.158 --> 43:40.368
I'm going to give it a minute.

43:41.828 --> 43:42.829
It's still broken.

43:42.912 --> 43:44.122
They haven't fixed it.

43:44.205 --> 43:45.790
STOP HERE ON RED SIGNAL

43:48.251 --> 43:49.460
We can't be related.

43:53.214 --> 43:56.300
-[TJ] I'm going to give it a minute.
-They give you back your gun?

43:56.676 --> 43:58.344
-[TJ] Yes, they did.
-Can I borrow it?

43:58.427 --> 44:00.429
[back car honking]

45:01.115 --> 45:03.117
