00:01.925 --> 00:03.161
All right.

00:03.860 --> 00:06.596
A brief little history
of my toys.

00:11.801 --> 00:14.272
And this is the remote

00:14.304 --> 00:16.640
for my first
remote-controlled car.

00:17.875 --> 00:19.844
I remember I was
still in Minneapolis

00:19.876 --> 00:21.278
at my parents'
apartment.

00:21.312 --> 00:22.847
We built these little jumps,

00:22.879 --> 00:24.916
like tiny jumps off the
curb, but it was just enough

00:24.949 --> 00:26.517
that you could jump over
a recycling box,

00:26.550 --> 00:27.685
or something
like that.

00:27.718 --> 00:29.754
I wanted one of
these things so badly.

00:29.786 --> 00:31.621
I remember this little punk
up the street,

00:31.655 --> 00:33.390
Jordan Hamilton,

00:33.423 --> 00:34.458
he had one

00:34.491 --> 00:36.628
and he
never allowed me to...

00:39.429 --> 00:41.899
bed for some reason,
maybe I was sick or something.

00:41.932 --> 00:43.868
I woke up
and there were these packages.

00:48.439 --> 00:51.209
But then
my first ever clear memory

00:51.241 --> 00:52.375
of getting a toy...

01:13.596 --> 01:14.431
Hey.

01:29.313 --> 01:30.515
I'm your new neighbor.

01:36.420 --> 01:37.254
Whatcha playing?

01:38.055 --> 01:39.958
I don't know,
some monster game.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.462
All right.

01:46.329 --> 01:47.831

02:48.391 --> 02:50.694
I don't think this song
actually needs to be acoustic.

02:50.728 --> 02:51.896
- I just...
- Sadie!

02:51.929 --> 02:53.030

Did you see the box labeled
"Drew" my mom sent me?

02:55.064 --> 02:58.468
I thought that was
like, the donation pile.

02:58.502 --> 03:00.438
Oh, goddammit, Sadie.

03:02.004 --> 03:04.875

- Let's go! C'mon
- It's not fine, it's.

03:10.114 --> 03:11.015
Hey!

03:11.049 --> 03:12.616
Where do you keep your
morning donations?

03:12.649 --> 03:13.884
It's in the back,
what do you need?

03:13.917 --> 03:15.786
It's a cardboard
box, like, this big.

03:15.818 --> 03:16.986
- What's in it?
- Yeah, what's in it?

03:17.020 --> 03:18.622
Everything, my action figures,

03:18.655 --> 03:19.991
my notebooks, my RC car.

03:21.157 --> 03:24.762
Just keep looking,
it's gotta be somewhere.

03:24.794 --> 03:26.730
Most of today's
donations have already

03:26.764 --> 03:27.832
been sent to the
distribution center.

03:27.865 --> 03:30.100
- Yes, Winston!
- Okay!

03:30.133 --> 03:31.001
- Good. Keep looking.
- That's good!

03:31.034 --> 03:32.436
You guys
can't be back here,

03:32.468 --> 03:33.370
this is for employee's only.

03:33.403 --> 03:33.770
Just relax, all
right? It's our stuff.

03:33.804 --> 03:34.972
Just chill.

03:35.004 --> 03:35.939

03:35.973 --> 03:37.908
Ma'am, you're
not listening to me.

03:37.941 --> 03:39.610
I'll call my boss. You guys
want me to call my boss?

03:39.643 --> 03:40.944
All right, I'm
gonna call him right now.

03:40.978 --> 03:41.813
Oh my god.

03:44.046 --> 03:45.115
Yes!

03:45.147 --> 03:46.150
There
are two people, they're in...

03:46.182 --> 03:47.016
My RC car.

03:47.050 --> 03:49.085
Yeah,
the back room!

03:49.118 --> 03:49.954
This is what I was
looking for.

03:49.986 --> 03:50.954
Okay, cool, let's go.

03:50.987 --> 03:52.490
Yeah, I don't

04:16.547 --> 04:19.083
finding something that

04:19.115 --> 04:21.985

04:29.225 --> 04:32.062
Minneapolis,
at my parents' apartment.

04:32.095 --> 04:34.698
I think you should
start with clips of the toys

04:34.730 --> 04:37.067
and then overlay your voice
on top of those clips,

04:37.100 --> 04:38.301
it'll speed things up.

04:38.334 --> 04:40.036
I mean, overall, do
you think I should pitch this

04:40.069 --> 04:41.971
to Arnon in tomorrow's meeting?

04:42.004 --> 04:42.839
Be harsh.

04:43.807 --> 04:45.076
- Uh.
- What?

04:46.310 --> 04:48.144
My uncle
came in, I think, no packages,

04:48.177 --> 04:49.012
he just pulled it
out of his pocket.

04:49.045 --> 04:52.615
I mean, it's not
like a fresh take

04:52.649 --> 04:55.185
on a web series, you know?

04:55.218 --> 04:57.153
It feels more like, uhm.

04:57.187 --> 04:58.156
Like what?

05:00.057 --> 05:02.460
I don't know, uh...

05:02.492 --> 05:06.096
it feels like something that
we would've done in school.

05:06.129 --> 05:08.165
Well then, why don't you
come over next week? Help me.

05:08.197 --> 05:11.601
I'm sorry, sir,
but I'm really busy.

05:11.634 --> 05:13.971
You fucking
liar, you're not busy.

05:14.004 --> 05:16.040
You've never been busy!

05:16.072 --> 05:17.707
Chris, just
stop walking like that

05:17.740 --> 05:19.008
and tell me what's up.

05:19.041 --> 05:21.678
Legally, I can't tell you yet,

05:21.711 --> 05:25.048
but you know that iPhone sci-fi
series I've been working on?

05:25.081 --> 05:25.882
Yeah, "Desert
Pals" or whatever.

05:25.915 --> 05:29.153
"Desert
Friends" yes.

05:30.821 --> 05:32.122
Dude, we got picked up!

05:32.154 --> 05:34.491
We're doing eight episodes.

05:34.524 --> 05:37.026
- What?
- Yeah, I know!

05:37.060 --> 05:38.995
Arnon made the deal to
move the show to TV.

05:39.028 --> 05:41.098
Well, streaming,
you know, but still.

05:41.130 --> 05:42.933
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

06:10.694 --> 06:11.528
What's this?

06:12.995 --> 06:14.731
I want you to
fix your truck.

06:14.764 --> 06:17.800
Just get a new radiator
or whatever it needs.

06:17.834 --> 06:19.670
It should be enough,
it's like 600 bucks.

06:21.137 --> 06:22.138
I'm not taking this.

06:23.206 --> 06:26.310
This is your money, this
is your new guitar money.

06:26.343 --> 06:28.979
Or, this could cover
the wedding lanterns.

06:29.012 --> 06:32.081
Okay, it isn't mine, babe.

06:32.115 --> 06:36.120
I mean, there's no my money
or your money any more, right?

06:38.154 --> 06:38.989
I guess.

06:41.091 --> 06:42.560
It's kinda terrifying.

06:42.593 --> 06:43.528
What, no.

06:46.096 --> 06:47.331
You know the goal.

06:47.363 --> 06:50.166
We need to start producing our
own steady stream of content.

06:50.199 --> 06:51.235
Right away.

06:51.267 --> 06:54.838
Let's steal something off
YouTube if you have to.

06:56.906 --> 06:58.041
Conference room, let's go.

06:59.175 --> 07:00.577
On it.

07:00.610 --> 07:02.579
So it's obviously
not a secret any more.

07:02.612 --> 07:05.882
We picked up our first in-house
project, "Desert Friends".

07:07.016 --> 07:09.086
Yeah, Drew, you were right
about Chris, by the way.

07:09.119 --> 07:10.921
He's such a weirdo,
but you know,

07:10.954 --> 07:12.323
I think that's what
makes his show so unique.

07:12.355 --> 07:14.692
Yeah, uh, thank you for
introducing us to him.

07:14.725 --> 07:15.760
Of course.

07:15.793 --> 07:17.627
So with that
in the works, we need our

07:17.661 --> 07:20.096
next project ASAP. Nate?

07:20.129 --> 07:24.334
All right, so I saw
this doc about a priest

07:24.367 --> 07:28.137
who becomes part of this
underground kickboxing league.

07:28.170 --> 07:29.807
No no no! It did
great in fests last year,

07:29.839 --> 07:30.840
and me and the filmmaker,
we can make it into...

07:30.874 --> 07:32.009
Next.

07:32.041 --> 07:33.810
Um, okay, page three.

07:33.843 --> 07:35.379
I actually know this director.

07:35.411 --> 07:38.681
He documented the
sex trade in Uganda.

07:38.714 --> 07:40.149
The project was
crowdfunded, so we have...

07:40.182 --> 07:41.117
No.

07:41.151 --> 07:42.853
Okay, so I
know sex trade in Uganda

07:42.886 --> 07:44.622
sounds like, really
fun and all, but uhm...

07:44.654 --> 07:47.890
We need something on
the verge of blowing up.

07:47.923 --> 07:49.192
Steph, anything else?

07:50.093 --> 07:51.128
Nope.

07:52.028 --> 07:53.363
Nothing?

07:58.134 --> 07:59.103
Uh, sir.

07:59.136 --> 08:01.005
I have actually
been watching a lot of

08:01.038 --> 08:03.139
documentaries recently,
so if you wanted,

08:03.173 --> 08:04.007
I could brainstorm...

08:04.040 --> 08:07.144
I'm sorry, could
you reschedule...

08:07.177 --> 08:10.314
...schedule a meeting with
the creatives for Thursday.

08:12.081 --> 08:13.016
All right, I'm on it.

08:15.052 --> 08:18.088
I do have an idea,
though, if you have a sec.

08:20.189 --> 08:22.660
Have you heard of
radio-controlled cars?

08:22.692 --> 08:24.293
It would be like a
TV show where there's

08:24.326 --> 08:26.697
a variety show, you
know, with jumping and...

08:26.730 --> 08:27.398
No, no.

08:29.098 --> 08:30.033
Sorry, sir.

08:30.067 --> 08:33.104
Maybe, um, tell me
about your idea later.

08:39.142 --> 08:41.778
I think
there's something

08:41.812 --> 08:44.181
It keeps leaking, and
I put water in it,

08:44.214 --> 08:45.716
and it's all messed up.

08:47.350 --> 08:49.920
Okay, I'll
look at it. We'll get you

08:49.952 --> 08:51.187
an estimate in about 45 minutes.

08:52.188 --> 08:54.057
There's wifi in the lounge.

08:55.091 --> 08:56.259
Thanks.

08:56.293 --> 08:58.062
You can leave your keys in
the car, please, thank you.

09:02.466 --> 09:06.003
I'm walking to find
a random hobby shop.

09:07.437 --> 09:10.041
I'm hoping they've got
a battery for this baby.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.876
I know it's weird, but
this guy gave me

09:13.909 --> 09:16.145
some of the best years
of my life,

09:16.178 --> 09:20.116
and, I kinda wanna get it
back up and running again.

09:20.149 --> 09:24.120
So I'm gonna document
what it's like

09:24.153 --> 09:25.088
to get back into RC cars.

09:33.929 --> 09:34.764
Yeah hey, Steph?

09:35.698 --> 09:36.732
Yeah, no, I know,
tell Arnon I'm, uh...

09:36.767 --> 09:39.002
...there was a ton of
traffic and I'm just gonna

09:39.034 --> 09:41.170
grab a sandwich.
I'll be back soon.

09:41.203 --> 09:42.038
All right, bye.

09:49.011 --> 09:50.012
I've only
been doing this 30 years,

09:50.046 --> 09:51.282
but here's what I would suggest.

09:55.184 --> 09:58.054
Now, you need to
take a look at this.

09:58.087 --> 09:59.456
This truck's our
bestselling car.

09:59.489 --> 10:00.724
It comes with
everything you need,

10:00.756 --> 10:02.992
fully assembled, so you don't
have to screw around with it.

10:03.025 --> 10:04.360
It's nice.

10:04.394 --> 10:05.195
Is it good at jumping?

10:05.227 --> 10:06.896
It's made for jumping.

10:06.929 --> 10:09.432
Check out the gorilla-ball
suspension in this.

10:09.466 --> 10:10.334
That thing's made for jumping.

10:10.366 --> 10:11.901
That's massive.

10:11.934 --> 10:13.103
You could drop it
off a building.

10:14.136 --> 10:15.838
30 miles an hour.

10:15.871 --> 10:16.806
30 miles an hour?

10:16.840 --> 10:19.309
That's what I just
said, 30 miles an hour.

10:19.341 --> 10:23.947
All right, you got me at a
particularly precarious time.

10:23.980 --> 10:26.149
I need to move some
stuff. I like you.

10:26.182 --> 10:29.153
I'll put you in this
for $295, out the door.

10:32.154 --> 10:33.057
What about this one?

10:34.124 --> 10:34.792
It's a racing buggy.

10:34.825 --> 10:36.259
You don't want a racing buggy!

10:37.326 --> 10:39.562
You don't want it,
it's a heartache.

10:39.596 --> 10:41.264
Racing, like on a racetrack?

10:41.298 --> 10:42.966
Yeah, they got tracks
all over the place,

10:42.999 --> 10:44.433
but it sucks the fun out of it.

10:44.466 --> 10:45.769
How fast does it go?

10:46.937 --> 10:49.373
With the right
gearing, 60-70 mph.

10:49.405 --> 10:53.042
With the charger, with
a controller, battery,

10:53.076 --> 10:55.211
it's gonna be $600+.

11:05.120 --> 11:05.956
Drew?

11:12.128 --> 11:14.163
So I went ahead and
patched the crack for you,

11:14.197 --> 11:15.465
but it's temporary.

11:15.498 --> 11:17.434
Would you replace
the radiator?

11:17.466 --> 11:18.901
Yeah, bro, I would.

11:18.934 --> 11:21.103
I'd replace it for $600,

11:21.136 --> 11:22.839
and I wouldn't charge
you for the patch.

11:25.241 --> 11:27.877
What the hell, I'll take it!

11:31.447 --> 11:32.249
- Here you go.
- No no no.

11:32.282 --> 11:33.417
Not that one.

11:33.450 --> 11:36.920
$550 cash, the rest on my card.

11:36.952 --> 11:38.054
I'm getting the racing buggy.

11:49.331 --> 11:51.134
Oh, did you
get my text earlier

11:51.167 --> 11:53.103
about adding me
on your insurance?

11:53.135 --> 11:55.072
Uh, yeah, yeah.

11:55.105 --> 11:56.072
Why do we have to get
that maternity thing,

11:56.105 --> 11:58.274
that seems like a waste of $300.

11:58.307 --> 12:01.912
Well, people have been
known to get pregnant,

12:01.945 --> 12:03.180
you know, when they get married.

12:04.246 --> 12:05.581
Okay.

12:05.615 --> 12:08.150
Sorry, anyway, you
were saying Arnon's

12:08.183 --> 12:09.385
ready to hear a
pitch, or something?

12:09.418 --> 12:12.154
Well, technically no,

12:12.187 --> 12:16.058
but Steph and Nate were
just pitching such garbage,

12:16.091 --> 12:16.925
and I thought about
what you said, you know,

12:16.960 --> 12:19.263
not really, you know,
going with like

12:19.296 --> 12:22.032
a fully-formed idea,
so I just blurted out

12:22.065 --> 12:24.902
the thing about RC car racing.

12:24.934 --> 12:26.202
Like from when you were 13?

12:26.235 --> 12:28.304
I know, I know, it's...

12:28.337 --> 12:30.506
He's trying to like,
get me legit shows

12:30.539 --> 12:34.343
and tours and you're half-assing
some shit about RC cars.

12:34.376 --> 12:36.245
I know, I know, it's stupid,

12:36.278 --> 12:38.282
but Arnon actually kinda
wanted to hear about it,

12:38.315 --> 12:41.251
so I started to research it,

12:41.283 --> 12:43.287
and it turns out that
RC car racing

12:43.320 --> 12:45.022
has this huge kind of
following.

12:45.054 --> 12:47.089
Don't bring up toy cars.

12:47.123 --> 12:48.893
Nobody is gonna take
you seriously.

12:50.393 --> 12:51.528
Fine, okay.

12:54.029 --> 12:55.098
Did you take your truck in?

12:56.231 --> 12:57.067
Yeah.

12:58.467 --> 13:00.703
Was I right, it
was like $600, yeah?

13:00.736 --> 13:02.206
Almost exactly.

13:03.206 --> 13:04.341
That's what I thought.

13:04.374 --> 13:07.610
I'm gonna go, work on
the garage.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.111
After you've
thoroughly washed the body,

13:42.144 --> 13:44.014
you wanna make sure it's
completely dry,

13:44.047 --> 13:45.048
and then your...

13:47.216 --> 13:48.718
Are you coming to bed?

13:48.751 --> 13:51.988
Just go to bed
without me for once.

13:52.022 --> 13:53.223
What are you doing down there?

13:53.255 --> 13:54.357
I'm just cleaning up.

14:13.543 --> 14:15.446
Hey, Chris, what's up, man?

14:18.280 --> 14:19.415
Nice.

14:19.448 --> 14:22.251
Uh, I was calling to see if
you wanted to maybe join...

14:24.620 --> 14:26.090
No way, pre-production.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.093
Sweet.

14:30.159 --> 14:31.728
Yeah, all right, bro.

14:46.142 --> 14:48.412
All right, here we are.

14:48.445 --> 14:51.215
My car's all decked out,
looking real badass.

14:52.381 --> 14:54.684
And, I'm about to do my
first-ever RC car race.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.633
Welcome
to round five

15:09.666 --> 15:10.701
of the JBRL Racing League,

15:10.734 --> 15:12.302
Southern California's
premiere radio-controlled

15:12.335 --> 15:14.370
off-road series!

15:14.403 --> 15:16.439
It's a perfect day out,
and we have top competitors

15:16.472 --> 15:20.076
from every major team, some
coming in from across the globe.

15:20.110 --> 15:21.711
After last week's
race in Coyote,

15:21.744 --> 15:24.081
most of our classes are neck
and neck as we make our way

15:24.114 --> 15:27.750
to the world championships
next month at Desert Thunder!

15:27.783 --> 15:29.552
Hey, are you checking in?

15:29.586 --> 15:30.387
Uh, yeah.

15:30.419 --> 15:32.755
All right, what class?

15:32.788 --> 15:34.423
Class?

15:34.456 --> 15:37.126
Two-wheel drive, four-wheel
drive, short course?

15:37.159 --> 15:38.194
Uh, it's, uh...

15:39.361 --> 15:41.230
It's an RC8B3,
four-wheel drive.

15:43.166 --> 15:44.701
You do know that
1/8-scale buggies

15:44.734 --> 15:46.870
are like the most
competitive, right?

15:46.903 --> 15:48.404
You're saying I'm screwed?

15:48.437 --> 15:49.273
How should I know?

16:01.350 --> 16:03.253
How's it going, man?

16:03.285 --> 16:05.154
Hey man, can I film you
tinkering around with your car?

16:05.187 --> 16:09.156
Got a lot of new trick parts
on them, it's less weight.

16:09.158 --> 16:10.293
Works really good.

16:10.326 --> 16:12.129
You think you've got
the fastest car out there?

16:12.162 --> 16:13.096
Absolutely.

16:13.129 --> 16:14.130
So what's the
deal with that one,

16:14.163 --> 16:15.131
why is that battery bigger
than the other ones?

16:15.164 --> 16:18.668
This is a 14.8 volt
and this is like 7.2.

16:18.701 --> 16:21.204
What we do is we
put these in series

16:21.236 --> 16:22.905
to make them the same voltage.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.507
Our radios, they
have telemetry,

16:24.541 --> 16:26.409
so we know what RPM
our batteries are at,

16:26.442 --> 16:28.211
what our battery voltage is.

16:28.244 --> 16:29.346
Are you guys better
than your parents?

16:29.379 --> 16:30.346
No.

16:30.379 --> 16:31.413
No, but you'd like to try?

16:31.447 --> 16:32.749
Still working on it.

16:32.782 --> 16:33.682
Who's the
best one of you guys?

16:33.716 --> 16:34.783
- I am.
- I am.

16:34.817 --> 16:37.387
Oh-ho-ho, that
sounds like fighting words.

17:16.425 --> 17:17.259
Let's
get those drivers

17:17.294 --> 17:19.429
back out to the track
to turn marshal.

17:19.461 --> 17:23.232
Next up is our first 1/8-scale
buggy qualifying race.

17:23.266 --> 17:24.201
This one is sure to be close,

17:24.233 --> 17:26.502
with Carhart, Chris,
and Hanson all vying for

17:26.536 --> 17:28.404
the top spots in
today's eight-man race

17:28.438 --> 17:30.607
later this afternoon.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.375
Here we go, here
we go, here we go!

17:32.407 --> 17:34.243
Good luck,
drivers, we're racing

17:34.277 --> 17:36.346
at the sound of the tone.

17:37.579 --> 17:40.983
Austin, Briggs
right on the back of Carhart!

17:41.017 --> 17:44.421
Oh! The newcomer shoots
right into the first turn!

17:44.453 --> 17:47.523
Rachel Carhart maintains
the lead over the triple.

17:47.557 --> 17:49.759
Hanson and Miller follow
close behind.

17:49.791 --> 17:52.228
Once again having some
trouble, off the ground

17:52.261 --> 17:55.397
and making his way around as
we approach the half-line.

17:55.431 --> 17:57.234
Brighton ready to
follow through...

17:57.267 --> 17:59.369
Oh! Brighton's car is
upside down again!

17:59.402 --> 18:01.738
And the battle is between
Carhart and Forenza,

18:01.770 --> 18:04.540
getting tighter as we come
back around the straightaway.

18:04.574 --> 18:05.675
Keep it clean, you can't
win the race on the...

18:17.787 --> 18:19.256
Well, that was a disaster.

18:21.023 --> 18:24.293
Yeah, um, no,
we're good on the...

18:24.326 --> 18:25.561
we're good on the 9x12,

18:25.595 --> 18:27.797
but 500 of each of
the other ones.

18:27.829 --> 18:30.299
Yeah, and if you have,
I don't actually know

18:30.333 --> 18:34.938
what the sizes are for it,
um...

18:34.971 --> 18:38.775
the square ones,
the 6x6?

18:38.807 --> 18:39.942
Yeah, perfect.

18:42.511 --> 18:44.013
Oh, hey, yeah,
I'll call you back, bye.

18:46.382 --> 18:47.984
Hey, Arnon, I was just wondering

18:48.017 --> 18:49.885
if I could get five minutes
of your time next week.

18:49.919 --> 18:51.988
It's about the
RC car racing.

18:52.020 --> 18:53.889
I've been doing some research
and it...

18:53.923 --> 18:55.892
Nate and Steph
finally have some leads,

18:55.924 --> 18:57.559
and with "Desert Friends"
in pre-pro,

18:57.593 --> 18:59.696
I need you supporting
both of them, all week.

18:59.729 --> 19:00.564
Cool.

19:07.569 --> 19:10.673
I replaced the
servo gears, changed the wires.

19:10.707 --> 19:11.541
I did a lot of work.

19:13.108 --> 19:16.512
I need to return this,
it's broken.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.549
You opened it, we don't
take returns on opened stuff.

19:20.583 --> 19:21.418
I told you that.

19:22.417 --> 19:23.619
You want a replacement part,

19:23.653 --> 19:24.855
I'll sell you a
replacement part.

19:25.954 --> 19:27.790
I'll pay a restocking
fee or something,

19:27.824 --> 19:29.526
I just need to get
my money back.

19:29.558 --> 19:30.359
No.

19:30.393 --> 19:32.595
No no no, hell no.

19:32.627 --> 19:33.428
Come on.

19:33.461 --> 19:34.931
I'll give you $250
for everything,

19:34.963 --> 19:36.398
including the charger.

19:36.432 --> 19:37.033
You crazy?

19:37.066 --> 19:38.535
I just paid $600 for this.

19:38.567 --> 19:40.068
Well, it's what I can do.

19:51.881 --> 19:53.617
How much for the
replacement part?

21:13.128 --> 21:13.963
Sorry.

21:24.105 --> 21:24.974
You suck.

21:26.843 --> 21:28.178
Sorry about that.

21:28.211 --> 21:30.180
No, I don't care if
you run me off the road,

21:30.212 --> 21:32.115
I just mean you
suck at driving.

21:32.147 --> 21:32.982
I know.

21:37.787 --> 21:40.088
So you blow $600 on
the fastest buggy,

21:40.122 --> 21:43.527
and realize it actually
takes talent? So now what,

21:44.527 --> 21:47.730
like, sell it on
Craigslist or something?

21:47.762 --> 21:49.631
Do you think I could
sell it on Craigslist?

21:49.664 --> 21:52.067
Maybe with some practice
you'll be as good as me

21:52.101 --> 21:53.937
in like six years.

21:53.970 --> 21:56.172
But you're pretty good
at jumping.

21:56.204 --> 21:57.173
No, I'm done.

21:57.205 --> 21:59.942
I already spent wedding
lantern money on this,

21:59.976 --> 22:01.044
so I need to get
rid of it and

22:01.076 --> 22:02.979
get back as much money
as I can.

22:03.011 --> 22:05.748
So I think you
should jump your buggy.

22:05.780 --> 22:07.850
You mean like, keep it and
play with it at lunchtime?

22:07.884 --> 22:11.253
No, I mean like
become the world's best

22:11.287 --> 22:14.723
RC car jumper there
ever, ever was.

22:14.757 --> 22:17.927
That's like an official
title or something?

22:17.960 --> 22:20.529
No, not yet,
but it should be.

22:25.634 --> 22:26.470
You see this?

22:30.573 --> 22:34.043
"Send us your raddest
RC car jump footage.

22:34.076 --> 22:36.846
"Video with the most
votes wins $200 cash."

22:36.878 --> 22:38.046
That wouldn't even cover
my cell phone bill.

22:38.079 --> 22:41.016
"Top three videos
get a chance to compete

22:41.049 --> 22:44.086
"in the first annual
long-distance jump off

22:44.119 --> 22:46.955
"Desert Thunder Championship
June 24th."

22:46.989 --> 22:48.758
So?

22:48.790 --> 22:51.094
So I get invited to
this race every year

22:51.126 --> 22:53.229
'cause I'm the best
girl racer in the state,

22:53.261 --> 22:56.865
but people like you that
don't really have any skill,

22:56.898 --> 22:58.133
I don't know.

22:58.166 --> 23:01.103
Just thought it was
crazy they're offering

23:01.136 --> 23:05.307
Yeah, Desert Thunder,
that sounds just delightful.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.209
Whatever, dude.

23:14.150 --> 23:15.585
I have 20 minutes
left for lunch.

23:15.617 --> 23:17.619
I'm so happy for you.

23:17.653 --> 23:19.055
Teach me how to jump cars.

23:19.087 --> 23:20.557
Like, now?

23:20.589 --> 23:22.759
I wanna win that
video contest thing.

23:24.059 --> 23:25.095
Uh...

23:26.061 --> 23:26.862
Okay, yeah, you have
to learn some control.

23:26.895 --> 23:29.132
Screw that,
I don't wanna race!

23:29.164 --> 23:30.332
I just wanna
film the cars flying.

23:30.365 --> 23:32.801
Right, but you have to go
in a straight line for that.

23:32.835 --> 23:34.804
I know, I know,
you can teach me how.

23:34.836 --> 23:35.672
Please?

23:36.771 --> 23:39.308
Okay, but not here.

23:46.915 --> 23:51.922
All
right, video log #184.

23:52.821 --> 23:54.022
It's just a number, it
doesn't really actually

23:54.056 --> 23:55.725
have any relevance to anything.

23:55.758 --> 23:57.294
Um, I'm here...

23:59.127 --> 24:00.864
I just, um...

24:01.763 --> 24:05.100
I just met this girl
at the track, and um...

24:07.836 --> 24:11.907
it's, um, she just,
she just, uh...

24:19.315 --> 24:20.682
What's your name, anyway?

24:20.715 --> 24:21.917
Rachel.

24:21.951 --> 24:22.786
I'm Drew.

24:29.392 --> 24:31.027
Watch out!

24:31.059 --> 24:32.327
Hey, we should bail.

24:32.361 --> 24:33.196
You wuss.

24:38.166 --> 24:39.301
Nice!

24:52.213 --> 24:53.383
- Dude!
- What!

25:00.189 --> 25:01.257
What the hell was that?

25:02.458 --> 25:05.695
That was amazing.
You should do the big one.

25:05.728 --> 25:06.562
Bigger than this?

25:06.596 --> 25:07.130
You wanna
do the big one!

25:07.163 --> 25:08.431
You're crazy, dude.

25:08.463 --> 25:11.000
Do it,
do it, do it!

25:12.201 --> 25:16.038
This shot is
going to be amazing.

25:16.071 --> 25:18.140
No, you have to learn how
to do the small jumps first.

25:18.173 --> 25:20.676
No no no no! The small
ones were too small.

25:20.710 --> 25:21.877
That was the problem.

25:21.911 --> 25:22.578
No, listen.

25:22.612 --> 25:24.047
Do you wanna be a big jumper?

25:24.079 --> 25:26.848
Then you can't be a jackass.

25:26.882 --> 25:29.317
People who jump RC cars
usually are jackasses.

25:29.351 --> 25:30.252
Well, how so?

25:30.286 --> 25:32.087
They launch their
dumb monster trucks

25:32.121 --> 25:34.290
onto hard, flat ground,
and they think it's funny

25:34.323 --> 25:36.826
to just destroy their
cars, and it's not funny.

25:36.858 --> 25:37.826
It's sickening!

25:37.859 --> 25:39.361
So you're saying I do
need a monster truck.

25:39.394 --> 25:41.998
No, I'm saying that if
you do the jump right,

25:42.030 --> 25:45.100
then a light,
fast buggy is the best.

25:45.134 --> 25:47.103
If you were to take
your bike, do this ramp,

25:47.135 --> 25:49.038
completely miss the
landing, and land, like,

25:49.070 --> 25:50.939
way over there,
what would happen?

25:50.972 --> 25:52.774
I'd probably blow out my rim.

25:52.807 --> 25:55.077
Exactly! It's the same
thing with this buggy.

25:55.111 --> 25:57.947
So you have to land it
down the landing.

25:57.980 --> 25:59.981
Not on the hard ground,
nope.

26:00.015 --> 26:03.152
You should want to jump
these over and over.

26:03.184 --> 26:03.786
Like these dorks,

26:03.818 --> 26:06.021
like BMX, like motocross!

26:06.055 --> 26:09.092
You dress smart, be smart.

26:09.125 --> 26:10.759
Jump smart!

26:10.792 --> 26:11.694
Okay, got it.

26:12.695 --> 26:16.064
Jump it, jump
it, jump it, jump it!

26:16.097 --> 26:16.999
Okay, here we go!

26:20.068 --> 26:21.070
- Hell yes!
- Yeah!!

26:32.280 --> 26:36.118
We've got the natural
cement, the reclaimed wood.

26:36.152 --> 26:38.354
You see the open pipes up there?

26:38.386 --> 26:40.288
Now this, this is the
centerpiece of the whole piece.

26:40.321 --> 26:43.992
This drum, I actually
got it in Africa.

26:44.026 --> 26:46.996
Why don't you join me
in my office? Thank you.

26:47.028 --> 26:50.500
[phones ringing and chattering

27:06.115 --> 27:08.084
[RC car motor
whirring on computer}

27:08.116 --> 27:09.519
Hell yeah!

27:09.551 --> 27:11.319
Woo!

27:11.353 --> 27:13.189
Uh, here's the promo footage.

27:15.089 --> 27:16.125
Thanks.

27:16.157 --> 27:18.260
Arnon said you could
cut something by tomorrow?

27:19.361 --> 27:21.030
Sure.

27:21.063 --> 27:21.898
Okay.

27:23.865 --> 27:25.334
All
right, here I go!

27:28.436 --> 27:29.237
Hell yeah!

27:29.270 --> 27:31.106
Babe, you need to
try this cake

27:31.140 --> 27:31.941
so we can put in
our order already.

27:31.973 --> 27:33.875
I'm taking a crap,
get outta here!

27:33.909 --> 27:35.812
Yeah, you're almost
my husband get over it.

27:35.845 --> 27:36.913
I don't care.

27:36.945 --> 27:40.081
Don't you have a sound
check to go to or something?

27:40.115 --> 27:42.518
The baker said that our
guests are supposed to know

27:42.550 --> 27:46.822
that the flavor we
chose subconsciously

27:46.855 --> 27:48.023
best represents us
as a couple.

27:48.057 --> 27:51.460
Oh my god, seriously?

27:51.492 --> 27:53.095
I think the red velvet
is the winner.

27:53.127 --> 27:55.263
Yeah, yeah, I know, because
the red matches your lips

27:55.297 --> 27:58.401
and the velvet matches the...

27:58.433 --> 28:00.836
I just don't care at all.

28:00.869 --> 28:02.404
I can't even come up with
something, just please leave.

28:02.438 --> 28:04.040
Forget it!

Campus seems pretty cool.

29:47.142 --> 29:48.912
People come here to die.

29:51.046 --> 29:54.115
So I was thinking,
you really don't need

29:54.148 --> 29:56.151
to waste your money
at a hardware store.

29:57.185 --> 29:58.253
What do you mean?

Go, go!

Drive, drive, drive!

30:15.104 --> 30:16.605
Fuck.

30:30.285 --> 30:35.091
All right, this is a
lot more work

30:35.124 --> 30:37.192
than I thought it
was gonna be.

30:38.093 --> 30:40.296
I got the wood...
building this jump

30:40.328 --> 30:41.297
in this friggin'
parking lot.

30:41.329 --> 30:43.566
I don't know where
Rachel is, she just left.

30:44.633 --> 30:48.037
I need to get back to work,
it is not even noon yet

30:48.069 --> 30:51.039
and I've been on lunch
for 90 minutes.

30:51.073 --> 30:56.079
Uh, so that's my day
so far. Oh shit.

31:03.419 --> 31:05.153
So I've determined
that I like you.

31:06.121 --> 31:07.656
How did you determine that?

31:07.689 --> 31:09.392
'Cause I've never known
someone to construct

31:09.424 --> 31:11.527
their own RC car ramp before.

31:12.493 --> 31:13.695
Really?

31:13.729 --> 31:14.764
It's almost done.

31:14.797 --> 31:18.134
I found the most perfect
landing ever over there.

31:19.500 --> 31:20.336
Let's jump this shit.

31:28.277 --> 31:31.146
All right, so it's gas
to lean back,

31:31.180 --> 31:32.581
brake to go forward?

31:32.614 --> 31:34.517
Uh, yeah, pretty much.

31:34.549 --> 31:35.784
Here we go.

31:35.817 --> 31:37.452
All right, go!

31:39.320 --> 31:40.155
Brake!

31:46.194 --> 31:49.097
All right, a little
less brake next time.

31:49.131 --> 31:50.566
No no no! We gotta go,
we gotta go.

31:50.598 --> 31:52.134
Why?

31:52.166 --> 31:54.436
Hey, move it back
further, man!

31:54.470 --> 31:56.072
Do it again!

31:56.105 --> 31:57.673
That was awesome.

31:57.705 --> 31:59.241
I gotta see it again.

33:23.392 --> 33:25.461
I think you guys are gonna
really like this video.

33:25.493 --> 33:26.928
I did break my a-arm,
though.

33:26.961 --> 33:29.865
Luckily Rachel gave me
some spare parts.

33:29.897 --> 33:31.533
It's gonna be great,
though.

33:39.208 --> 33:39.875
Here we go.

33:40.776 --> 33:41.744
Oh, nice.

33:41.777 --> 33:43.879
Are we happy with how
these promos turned out?

33:43.912 --> 33:45.815
Nate's lead just went away.

33:47.583 --> 33:48.618
Shoot.

33:48.651 --> 33:52.188
Um, all right, well, I
can make some phone calls.

33:52.221 --> 33:53.855
Close the door for a sec.

34:02.698 --> 34:03.865
Where have you been going?

34:03.898 --> 34:04.699
Look.

34:07.236 --> 34:10.539
I, uh... I wanted to get
together a nicer edit

34:10.572 --> 34:13.742
before I showed you this, but
this is what I've been doing.

34:15.744 --> 34:17.780
I've been researching
and filming the RC world.

34:17.813 --> 34:18.780
I think it's gonna be huge.

34:20.382 --> 34:22.483
I could put an edit
together nicer than this,

34:22.516 --> 34:24.351
and if you wanted me
to, I could present it.

34:24.385 --> 34:25.221
Drew.

34:29.891 --> 34:31.293
Get the fuck back to work.

35:16.972 --> 35:18.740
Still organizing?

35:18.773 --> 35:19.842
Never-ending.

35:20.809 --> 35:22.378
I'm way too tired
to cook anything.

35:22.411 --> 35:24.947
The kids were on speed
today or something.

35:24.980 --> 35:27.782
Um, we need to talk.

35:27.815 --> 35:29.617
Yeah, I just, I need to
change out of these clothes.

35:29.650 --> 35:31.886
Yeah, I know, it's
gonna take one second.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.556
Arnon emailed me, if
that's what it's about.

35:34.588 --> 35:35.724
I know he did.

35:35.757 --> 35:37.893
Okay, well, where have you
been going at lunch, Drew?

35:37.925 --> 35:38.893
That's so weird.

35:38.927 --> 35:40.095
How is that weird?

35:40.128 --> 35:42.564
I've been taking... God forbid
...an actual lunch break,

35:42.597 --> 35:44.466
and then everybody
starts treating me like...

35:44.498 --> 35:45.900
Okay, well, I just don't
get why you're lying about it.

35:45.934 --> 35:47.569
Anyway, we can talk
about it later,

35:47.601 --> 35:48.837
I just, I need food.

35:51.806 --> 35:54.442
Um, I'm taking a
half-day tomorrow

35:54.476 --> 35:55.911
to catch up on some
wedding stuff.

35:58.512 --> 35:59.715
Drew.

35:59.748 --> 36:00.650
Hm, sorry, what?

36:02.083 --> 36:03.885
I said can you help
me tomorrow at lunch,

36:03.918 --> 36:05.920
'cause we're gonna be
gone all weekend.

36:07.789 --> 36:09.325
I can't take lunch breaks.

36:10.057 --> 36:12.295
That's what I'm telling you,
this job is soul-sucking.

36:13.461 --> 36:14.297
Seriously?

36:15.797 --> 36:17.465
I find that really weird,
because I watch kids,

36:17.498 --> 36:18.933
like, all day long.

36:20.402 --> 36:22.604
It's not like I have all
this time to write music.

36:22.637 --> 36:25.341
It's like you have
all these showcases,

36:25.373 --> 36:27.909
and then that Arizona gig
right before the wedding,

36:27.943 --> 36:31.047
and then the freakin'
East Coast Fall Tour.

36:32.414 --> 36:33.982
It seems like you spend a lot
of time doing what you love.

36:37.018 --> 36:38.954
The day you've all
been waiting for.

36:38.987 --> 36:42.958
The day where Rachel
and I go big or go home.

36:42.990 --> 36:45.960
Now, if you like this video,
or even love this video,

36:45.994 --> 36:47.896
please, please, please
vote for it,

36:47.929 --> 36:50.599
and vote for it as much
as you possibly can.

37:01.041 --> 37:02.043
Hey, we're still in fourth?

37:02.077 --> 37:03.946
Have you seen number one?

37:03.978 --> 37:05.646
Go go go!

37:05.679 --> 37:07.782
Yeah, I know, it's
painful to watch.

37:07.815 --> 37:09.451
I mean, what the hell?

37:09.483 --> 37:11.519
They're jumping a car
into a lake.

37:11.552 --> 37:13.054
Maybe your jumps
just have to be bigger,

37:13.088 --> 37:15.824
and your landings
have to be smoother?

37:15.856 --> 37:17.059
No, no, no.

37:17.092 --> 37:18.160
Look, I had an idea, okay?

37:18.193 --> 37:20.095
We need more shock value.

37:20.128 --> 37:20.963
Check this out.

37:23.898 --> 37:24.733
Bam.

37:25.634 --> 37:26.735
It's a house.

37:26.768 --> 37:28.938
Yeah, we jump the car
over my house.

37:29.938 --> 37:30.905
You're a dumbass.

37:30.938 --> 37:31.973
What?

37:33.240 --> 37:36.077
Also, why did you not tell me
that your dad owns this place?

37:36.110 --> 37:39.013
Well, that's exactly why
I can't leave it unattended.

37:39.047 --> 37:40.081
Oh, come on.

37:40.114 --> 37:41.149
I'll bring you right back.

37:41.182 --> 37:44.719
I mean, no offense, but
this place is pretty dead.

37:44.753 --> 37:45.988
Yeah, because we're like
one sale away

37:46.021 --> 37:47.423
from going out of business.

37:49.056 --> 37:50.692
- I'm sorry, but look...
- I thought you didn't wanna

37:50.724 --> 37:52.427
be like those idiots.

37:52.460 --> 37:53.428
You're not getting it,
all right?

37:53.461 --> 37:55.530
This is like... think
skateboarding tricks,

37:55.563 --> 37:58.500
but with RC cars.

37:58.532 --> 37:59.768
Nobody is doing this.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.770
It'll be incredible.
Amazing.

38:02.804 --> 38:03.639
Pretty please.

38:04.773 --> 38:05.807
I'll buy you a Big Gulp.

38:06.942 --> 38:07.742
Fine.

38:07.775 --> 38:09.844
There we go, a
little bribery, bam!

38:13.248 --> 38:16.117
So you really wouldn't
go to Desert Thunder,

38:16.150 --> 38:19.020
even if you got invited
to do the record jump?

38:19.054 --> 38:20.456
A week before my wedding?

38:21.623 --> 38:24.994
Yeah, I keep forgetting
that you're getting married.

38:26.594 --> 38:28.129
Is it a fun event?

38:29.630 --> 38:30.465
Yeah, I hear it is.

38:32.501 --> 38:33.969
I thought you got
invited every year?

38:34.001 --> 38:37.005
I do, but I'd never be able to

38:37.038 --> 38:38.039
drive up there on my own.

38:38.072 --> 38:39.174
Maybe when I move out.

38:40.641 --> 38:41.809
When are you gonna move out?

38:41.842 --> 38:43.144
Never.

38:43.177 --> 38:45.047
Why don't you just
ask your dad to take you

38:45.079 --> 38:48.516
and get somebody to watch
the shop for the day?

38:48.550 --> 38:50.553
I told you, my dad
hates me racing.

38:51.552 --> 38:52.153
Screw that.

38:54.121 --> 38:54.956
Just...

38:56.958 --> 38:57.925
just ask him.

38:57.958 --> 39:01.096
Maybe if he's in an
extra good mood today,

39:01.128 --> 39:02.498
I will try asking him.

39:03.297 --> 39:05.700
Hey, do two of you wanna
go film in the back?

39:05.733 --> 39:06.534
Yeah!

39:06.568 --> 39:08.170
Cool, they're rolling.

39:08.202 --> 39:09.905
Let's do this.

39:27.222 --> 39:28.657
- Fuck!
- Oh my god

39:52.146 --> 39:53.114
Holy shit!

39:53.148 --> 39:53.949
We got it!

39:53.981 --> 39:54.983
We got it, it landed!

39:55.016 --> 39:58.153
That was amazing! Wow!

39:59.987 --> 40:00.855
Hey! Say something
to the camera!

40:00.889 --> 40:03.258
This is the greatest day
of my life!

40:05.594 --> 40:06.394
Be careful!

40:06.427 --> 40:08.063
There's a car trying
to come through.

40:08.096 --> 40:09.130
Drew!

40:09.164 --> 40:09.999
There's a car!

40:21.943 --> 40:23.612
Is that the fiancée?

40:25.045 --> 40:26.581
Should I walk home?

40:27.748 --> 40:28.884
Hey, I was kidding!

40:28.916 --> 40:30.786
I'm already late, you have
to take me back to the shop!

40:36.925 --> 40:37.926
Leave me alone.

40:37.958 --> 40:39.060
Babe.

40:39.094 --> 40:40.028
Open the door.

40:41.096 --> 40:43.164
Don't babe me, please go away.

40:44.666 --> 40:45.901
We need to talk.

40:48.769 --> 40:50.038
I said leave me
the fuck alone!

40:50.070 --> 40:51.039
I get it, you're upset.

40:57.177 --> 40:58.980
I can just keep
picking the lock.

41:36.951 --> 41:40.222
If you need any help with
the wedding stuff today,

41:40.255 --> 41:41.090
I'm around.

41:51.065 --> 41:52.000
Hey.

41:52.032 --> 41:53.034
Holy shit.

41:53.068 --> 41:54.002
You scared me.

41:54.034 --> 41:56.137
I need that drive.

41:56.170 --> 41:57.204
Uh, yeah...

42:01.141 --> 42:02.043
Thank you.

42:04.112 --> 42:06.014
I'm sorry, what am
I supposed to do now?

42:06.947 --> 42:07.782
I don't know.

42:08.916 --> 42:11.719
But did Arnon tell you
anything?

42:11.753 --> 42:13.122
No, we're all
on set today.

42:34.375 --> 42:36.945
Drew,
hey, this is Brian Lutes

42:36.978 --> 42:38.346
from Team Associated.

42:38.378 --> 42:40.981
Congratulations on winning
the video contest, dude.

42:41.014 --> 42:42.850
Holy shit,
that house jump?

42:42.884 --> 42:44.485
Ha! We're freaking out
over here!

42:44.518 --> 42:46.087
Gimme a call back
and we can chat

42:46.121 --> 42:47.056
about tomorrow's jump contest.

42:47.088 --> 42:49.724
We're gonna take a break
from racing at noon

42:49.757 --> 42:51.025
to have the jump contest.

43:44.445 --> 43:46.014
Hey, Sadie.

43:46.047 --> 43:47.815
Can you just turn on
the lights and come out?

43:51.452 --> 43:53.222
♪ Ah ♪

43:57.157 --> 43:59.360
You're like a dumb brick.

43:59.393 --> 44:01.495
I'm not upset because I
didn't get wedding lanterns,

44:01.528 --> 44:04.065
which these aren't
even wedding lanterns,

44:04.097 --> 44:05.233
these are just shitty lights.

44:05.266 --> 44:07.469
Okay, I'm pissed because I
don't know where you've been

44:07.501 --> 44:09.070
or what the hell
you've been up to.

44:09.103 --> 44:11.239
Look, I, look, I know, I know.

44:11.271 --> 44:14.041
I've been wanting to show
you this for a while.

44:14.074 --> 44:18.245
I've been, I've been filming
and editing RC car races.

44:18.278 --> 44:18.947
I mean, it's like what you said,

44:18.980 --> 44:20.581
it's the next step of my career.

44:20.614 --> 44:23.818
You have no career, okay?

44:23.851 --> 44:27.021
You are 26 and you literally
have nothing going for you.

44:28.255 --> 44:31.326
I'm so sick of giving you
advice and finding jobs for you

44:31.358 --> 44:34.528
and literally holding your
hand through everything.

44:34.561 --> 44:36.831
I'm worried that you're never
gonna get your shit together,

44:36.864 --> 44:39.466
which honestly makes me really
worried about our future.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.570
What, so you don't want
me to come this weekend?

44:41.603 --> 44:42.436
No.

44:44.005 --> 44:47.075
And that toy car looked
really expensive.

44:47.108 --> 44:49.111
How'd I miss that on our
bank statement?

44:50.010 --> 44:52.146
I just, uh...
I patched the radiator.

44:52.179 --> 44:53.047
What, speak up!

44:54.949 --> 44:57.586
I bought it with the
repair money.

45:00.487 --> 45:03.023
You spent my $600
on a toy.

45:03.056 --> 45:05.059
I thought you said
it was our money!

45:05.092 --> 45:07.061
I honestly need
this weekend to decide

45:07.094 --> 45:08.462
if I ever wanna see you again.

45:10.197 --> 45:11.065
Sadie.

45:41.028 --> 45:42.030
Hey, Chris.

45:46.333 --> 45:48.036
Oh my god, it's so big!

45:57.945 --> 45:58.579
Dude!

45:59.480 --> 46:01.916
Look at the girth
on this thing, man.

46:01.949 --> 46:02.984
It's above average.

46:03.018 --> 46:04.318
Dude, wait til you see
what's inside the studio.

46:09.222 --> 46:10.391
Can we go in there?

46:10.425 --> 46:11.226
Let's go.

46:12.293 --> 46:14.396
Sir, sir! The
enemy is fast approaching!

46:16.197 --> 46:18.133
I don't advise you
go into the asteroid field

46:18.166 --> 46:20.101
until we get the proper
guidance systems.

46:20.134 --> 46:22.103
It's too late,
we're going in hard!

46:32.981 --> 46:35.583
Oh... so fun.

46:45.025 --> 46:46.126
Do you think I
should tell Sadie

46:46.159 --> 46:47.094
before or after the wedding?

46:50.097 --> 46:51.398
I mean, I'm just
trying to figure out

46:51.431 --> 46:53.600
the right thing to do,
man.

46:53.634 --> 46:55.469
Being honest doesn't
mean, you know,

46:55.503 --> 46:59.541
dumping all your
thoughts or bad feelings

46:59.574 --> 47:03.144
on your girl. I mean,
no one can handle that.

47:06.014 --> 47:09.184
So like, is it okay
to hide the truth,

47:09.217 --> 47:13.121
if it wouldn't do
anything anyway?

47:13.153 --> 47:14.389
Of course.

47:14.422 --> 47:16.057
It's like, you wouldn't
want her to confess

47:16.090 --> 47:18.126
every time she thought
another guy was hot, right?

47:20.427 --> 47:22.029
Today's a big day.

47:22.063 --> 47:24.166
I'm going to Desert Thunder.

47:25.065 --> 47:26.134
I'm pretty excited.

47:27.135 --> 47:29.638
Sorry about the shitty
quality of the video.

47:30.670 --> 47:33.140
Some girl stole my GoPro.

47:33.173 --> 47:36.311
There's the pinion gear
that I'm gonna be replacing.

47:38.545 --> 47:39.714
Shell is ready.

47:40.849 --> 47:43.418
We have this baby, still
gotta do some tweaks on that,

47:43.451 --> 47:45.086
but we should be good.

49:23.284 --> 49:23.885
Hello?

49:23.918 --> 49:26.153
Hey, is Rachel there?

49:28.556 --> 49:30.358
Hey, just wait outside,
I'm almost ready.

49:37.465 --> 49:40.168
Actually, you can go
around back.

49:53.947 --> 49:54.782
Hey!

49:56.317 --> 49:57.284
I'm over here, loser.

50:02.690 --> 50:03.525
Cool bike.

50:10.463 --> 50:11.298
You good?

50:19.472 --> 50:20.509
Okay, pack these.

50:24.445 --> 50:26.948
Rachel Catherine Carhart.

50:26.981 --> 50:28.950
I like that, it's elegant.

50:28.983 --> 50:30.518
R.C.C.

50:30.550 --> 50:31.385
Yeah.

50:32.920 --> 50:37.925
Wait, RC Car... hart?

50:41.262 --> 50:41.930
No comment.

50:41.963 --> 50:42.898
RC Carhart!

50:44.264 --> 50:46.902
How did I not know
that your name is RC...

50:47.934 --> 50:49.503
It's my name, Drew.

50:51.606 --> 50:52.941
Pack my shirt, leave me alone.

50:52.974 --> 50:55.210
You were destined to do this.

50:55.242 --> 50:56.311
- I was!
- Oh my God.

50:56.344 --> 50:58.179
I can't believe it.

50:58.913 --> 51:00.748
Chill out, it's just my name.

51:00.780 --> 51:01.748
Can you believe that?

51:01.782 --> 51:03.585
RC Carhart!

51:03.617 --> 51:04.952
RC!

51:04.985 --> 51:06.420
- No!
- RC Carhart!

51:06.454 --> 51:07.989
You're not even packing right!

51:08.021 --> 51:09.923
We're never gonna leave.
You have my shark.

51:09.956 --> 51:12.527
- It's my good luck shark!
- I'm in shock, I just.

51:12.559 --> 51:15.230
He's mine, and so's my
shirt, and so's my name.

51:15.262 --> 51:16.563
Leave me alone, Drew.

51:16.597 --> 51:17.932
You're making me
very self-conscious.

51:23.670 --> 51:25.339
Black or white?

51:25.373 --> 51:26.007
Uh.

51:26.041 --> 51:27.842
Just kidding, duh, black.

51:31.012 --> 51:32.981
Whoa, hey, whoa,
what are you doing?

51:33.014 --> 51:33.815
What?

51:33.847 --> 51:34.949
Nothing.

51:34.981 --> 51:36.884

So this is like,
my first ever road trip.

52:45.552 --> 52:46.855
This is a
road trip now?

52:48.989 --> 52:50.925
Or, it's not a road trip.

52:50.958 --> 52:52.827
Sorry,
it's a road trip.

52:53.994 --> 52:55.697
So I know this is none
of my business, but like,

52:55.730 --> 52:57.932
it's super weird that you're
getting married in a week.

52:59.065 --> 53:00.600
How so?

53:00.634 --> 53:02.737
I don't know, like, is
your fiancée cool with you

53:02.769 --> 53:06.773
hanging out with another
girl and going on, like, a...

53:06.806 --> 53:08.509
- Road trip?
- Yeah, exactly.

53:11.077 --> 53:15.083
Just another girl, road
trip, alone, without her.

53:15.115 --> 53:18.385
It's just like... I know
I'm not like cute

53:18.418 --> 53:19.853
or desirable or anything, but...

53:19.887 --> 53:20.922
Hold on one second.

53:33.934 --> 53:36.037
We got into a huge
fight last night.

53:39.873 --> 53:40.841
What, we're not talking now?

53:40.875 --> 53:42.043
I don't know, dude.

53:42.076 --> 53:45.947
You're just, like, totally
lying to her like it's nothing.

53:45.980 --> 53:46.880
How am I lying to her?

53:46.914 --> 53:47.982
I dunno, I don't know much,

53:48.014 --> 53:50.016
but that's just
like, shady shit.

53:50.050 --> 53:52.019
But forget I brought it up,
I'm sorry.

53:52.052 --> 53:52.887
We'll just talk about
something else.

53:52.920 --> 53:54.122
Fine, look, I feel bad.

53:55.688 --> 53:56.523
I just...

53:57.958 --> 53:59.527
I feel like there's
some things that we...

54:00.927 --> 54:02.696
That I don't need to
tell my girlfriend.

54:02.730 --> 54:04.465
Oh my god, all right,
we're definitely

54:04.498 --> 54:06.601
changing the subject and
from now on,

54:06.634 --> 54:08.103
we just talk about RC cars.

54:10.871 --> 54:12.940
I actually have an idea.

54:12.972 --> 54:14.007
What?

54:15.009 --> 54:16.943
What are we doing, drive.

54:16.976 --> 54:17.944
I don't get it.

54:17.978 --> 54:19.981
Can this piece of shit
truck go faster than 50?

54:25.920 --> 54:28.088
This is a terrible idea!

54:28.121 --> 54:29.523
No, it's gonna be awesome!

54:30.657 --> 54:31.291
Go faster!

54:31.326 --> 54:33.161
I'm trying, my car can't.

54:34.994 --> 54:36.697
Holy shit.

54:40.233 --> 54:41.536
I'm doing it!

54:42.235 --> 54:44.172
Watch out,
don't lean out so far.

54:44.204 --> 54:46.074
We're gonna have
so many views!

54:49.043 --> 54:50.178
Hey, someone's coming!

54:52.045 --> 54:53.447
They think we're crazy!

56:05.786 --> 56:07.121
Drew,
you're last up,

56:07.153 --> 56:09.190
and you have two attempts
to clear Matt's record

56:09.222 --> 56:11.224
of 95 feet.

56:11.257 --> 56:14.027
Do we leave the ramp where it
is, or start a little smaller?

56:14.061 --> 56:15.963
I'm gonna go for the
win on the first attempt.

56:15.996 --> 56:19.166
Nice confidence, man,
I love it, woo!

56:21.034 --> 56:22.569
We'll give him some space,
give him some space.

56:23.336 --> 56:24.938
Whenever
you're ready, Drew.

56:37.083 --> 56:39.719
All right,
that is tragic.

56:39.753 --> 56:40.988
Hey, can we get some
people to help him

56:41.021 --> 56:43.725
get his car back together?
Oh my gosh.

56:44.625 --> 56:46.793
Tragic, tragic.

56:46.827 --> 56:48.930
I'm done! I'm done.

56:48.963 --> 56:50.731
Does anyone have a spare car?

56:52.099 --> 56:53.301
Uh, does
anybody have a spare car

56:53.333 --> 56:56.870
just lying around for him?

56:56.903 --> 56:58.972
This is really, um...

56:59.005 --> 57:00.208
No, no! No way!

57:05.144 --> 57:05.947
What the hell are you doing?

57:05.980 --> 57:06.981
You race in 30 minutes.

57:07.014 --> 57:07.914
No, it's not up to you.

57:07.949 --> 57:09.983
My car was always faster
than yours anyway.

57:10.016 --> 57:12.219
I can't handle the pressure.

57:12.251 --> 57:13.987
What is up with all
these cameramen?

57:14.021 --> 57:15.156
Stop it, all right, I lost.

57:15.188 --> 57:17.123
No! You have another shot.

57:17.157 --> 57:18.059
Get outta my way!

57:23.998 --> 57:25.766
This will
be his final attempt,

57:25.798 --> 57:30.204
using a replacement car
...his girlfriend's RC8B3.

57:30.237 --> 57:32.173
She's not my girlfriend!

57:32.206 --> 57:34.307
Correction, Rachel Carhart

57:34.340 --> 57:36.009
is not his girlfriend.

57:36.043 --> 57:37.612
I'm getting married next week.

57:37.644 --> 57:38.980
Oh,
sorry, ladies,

57:39.012 --> 57:42.215
Drew's getting
married next week!

57:42.248 --> 57:44.117
Whenever
you're ready, Drew.

58:00.800 --> 58:01.402
Ah, well,
I guess that's the

58:01.434 --> 58:03.003
end of the jump contest

58:03.036 --> 58:04.204
and we'll get back to racing.

58:04.237 --> 58:06.139
Just remember that
we have 2 hot dogs

58:06.172 --> 58:08.976
for only $2, benefiting the...

58:16.050 --> 58:17.051
Hey, wait,
where are you going?

58:17.083 --> 58:18.085
My race is about to start!

58:18.117 --> 58:19.953
Yeah, what car
are you gonna use?

58:19.987 --> 58:21.188
Some guy said I could
use his old one

58:21.221 --> 58:21.889
if I use my motor.

58:21.922 --> 58:24.125
Yeah, cool, well,
do that,

58:24.157 --> 58:27.161
and then get a ride
home with the cameraman.

58:27.193 --> 58:27.994
Are you just
gonna leave me here?

58:28.027 --> 58:29.029
I'm just done with it,

58:29.063 --> 58:29.864
all right?

58:29.896 --> 58:30.498
I'm done with all of it.

58:30.530 --> 58:32.132
Are you gonna come or not?

58:33.032 --> 58:34.101
Fine.

58:34.134 --> 58:35.737
No, wait wait wait!
Okay! fine!

59:04.864 --> 59:06.299
Dude, is there something
wrong with your car?

59:16.909 --> 59:18.413
Is there a word worse
than fuck?

59:20.146 --> 59:21.715
Oh, god.

59:45.105 --> 59:46.307
Hey, what the hell?

59:51.210 --> 59:52.846
Drew, what are you doing?

59:54.981 --> 59:57.018
Hey, can you just
stop and talk to me?

01:00:00.521 --> 01:00:02.223
Drew, what are you doing?

01:00:02.255 --> 01:00:03.090
Stop!

01:00:09.862 --> 01:00:12.465
It's the videos. I
gotta delete the videos.

01:00:12.498 --> 01:00:14.034
No, Drew, leave
the videos alone.

01:00:15.302 --> 01:00:17.004
- Delete.
- Don't.

01:00:17.036 --> 01:00:18.004
- Delete.
- Don't do it.

01:00:18.038 --> 01:00:19.840
Don't touch the videos!

01:00:19.873 --> 01:00:20.508
Get away from me, all right?

01:00:20.541 --> 01:00:21.676
They're my videos!

01:00:21.708 --> 01:00:22.742
People love the videos,
what are you talking about?

01:00:22.777 --> 01:00:26.146
Oh yeah, thanks, thanks
a lot, hobby shop girl.

01:00:28.081 --> 01:00:30.017
Right, your fiancée
probably doesn't even

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:31.519
know you're here, does she?

01:00:31.552 --> 01:00:33.086
Clearly you don't
wanna get married.

01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:34.420
Of course I do.

01:00:34.454 --> 01:00:35.389
I love Sadie.

01:00:36.824 --> 01:00:37.825
I hate that name.

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.096
Sadie, Sadie,
Sadie, Sadie, Sadie,

01:00:42.128 --> 01:00:43.130
Sadie, Sadie!

01:00:45.998 --> 01:00:46.966
What, did it crack?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.135
Oh, it's wonderful,
it won't even turn on.

01:00:49.168 --> 01:00:50.403
Thanks.

01:00:50.436 --> 01:00:51.271
I'm sorry.

01:00:55.007 --> 01:00:56.276
Can you please just admit
that this was

01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:58.978
always something
more than RC cars?

01:00:59.012 --> 01:01:00.014
Are you kidding me?

01:01:00.047 --> 01:01:01.815
- Just admit it.
- No.

01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:03.150
Say that you like me, Drew!

01:01:03.182 --> 01:01:04.117
What, are we 12 now?

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:05.085
Well, you're sure
acting like it, yeah!

01:01:05.119 --> 01:01:07.288
Yeah, fine, okay,
obviously, I love you!

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.255
I mean, no guy spends this

01:01:08.289 --> 01:01:10.057
- amount of time with a girl...
- You love me?

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:11.025
Yeah, what?

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.195
Dude, I...

01:01:15.394 --> 01:01:16.496
I know.

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:18.065
Just skipped right on
past like, then?

01:01:20.132 --> 01:01:21.401
This is obviously just
some sort of fantasy.

01:01:22.635 --> 01:01:25.105
I'm on this path with
Sadie, you know,

01:01:25.137 --> 01:01:26.807
this specific route, and...

01:01:29.009 --> 01:01:30.577
I gotta be a man and I
have to stick it out!

01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:43.324
This is so messed up.

01:02:05.612 --> 01:02:07.347
None of this is
funny at all!

01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:12.119
You're such a loser, Drew.

01:02:12.152 --> 01:02:13.153
I know.

01:02:21.994 --> 01:02:26.199
So, the mechanic says the
car's not gonna make it home.

01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:32.005
Offered me $300 for parts...

01:02:35.208 --> 01:02:36.210
...so, I'll sleep on it.

01:02:40.179 --> 01:02:41.414
Sleep on it where?

01:02:43.016 --> 01:02:44.151
I don't know, a motel.

01:03:23.389 --> 01:03:25.025
That's so true, and like,

01:03:25.057 --> 01:03:28.195
his suit was kind of
like that same vibe, too.

01:03:28.228 --> 01:03:30.164
Like it was just too much.

01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:31.030
Where do you
buy that suit?

01:03:31.063 --> 01:03:31.998
Where do you get...

01:03:32.032 --> 01:03:32.932
like, I've never seen
a store that's like.

01:03:32.965 --> 01:03:33.733
I don't know, but
you should get one.

01:03:33.766 --> 01:03:36.002
- Yeah, you like that?
- Uh-huh.

01:03:40.139 --> 01:03:41.307
The motor and the
speed control are fine,

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.476
it's the fucking front end.

01:03:45.045 --> 01:03:48.315
Yeah, my shocks and my
linkage are just done.

01:03:48.347 --> 01:03:50.083
Hey, can I see the purple
one that's in your hand?

01:03:50.117 --> 01:03:51.419
- Sorry about that.
- Thanks.

01:03:52.585 --> 01:03:54.687
Stealing all my tools
over there.

01:03:58.425 --> 01:03:59.293
Your dad's calling.

01:04:04.331 --> 01:04:05.466
You're not gonna get it?

01:04:07.067 --> 01:04:08.434
It's not gonna get
better until I move out.

01:04:10.570 --> 01:04:12.573
Does he know that
you came along with me?

01:04:12.606 --> 01:04:14.041
I'm sure he does.

01:04:16.143 --> 01:04:18.077
Will he be pissed?

01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:19.480
Uh, honestly?

01:04:19.512 --> 01:04:21.347
He will most likely
call the cops.

01:04:25.217 --> 01:04:26.052
Wait, really?

01:04:28.554 --> 01:04:30.023
I mean, what's the deal?

01:04:32.525 --> 01:04:33.728
My mom wrecked him.

01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:40.501
But screw it, I'm gonna
move out and get a real job,

01:04:41.501 --> 01:04:46.240
and get my own place, and just
put everything into racing.

01:04:48.175 --> 01:04:50.144
And, it will be great.

01:04:55.248 --> 01:04:56.117
Hey, what the hell?

01:05:19.271 --> 01:05:20.606
Did you sleep?

01:05:20.639 --> 01:05:21.708
Not very well.

01:05:25.612 --> 01:05:26.480
Getting close.

01:05:32.184 --> 01:05:33.186
God.

01:05:58.878 --> 01:06:01.181
It's a left up here, man.

01:06:01.213 --> 01:06:02.215
What?

01:06:02.248 --> 01:06:03.083
It's a left up here.

01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:06.119
No, Mom, that feature
doesn't even exist.

01:06:06.152 --> 01:06:08.488
You can't find people
on their phones,

01:06:08.521 --> 01:06:10.391
like, you can't
find where they are.

01:06:12.224 --> 01:06:13.159
He's here.

01:06:18.197 --> 01:06:19.732
Oh my god, where were you?

01:06:19.766 --> 01:06:24.805
I was at a RC car
race a couple hours away,

01:06:24.838 --> 01:06:29.343
and my RC car broke, and
then my phone shattered,

01:06:29.376 --> 01:06:32.146
and then the engine
in my truck exploded.

01:06:33.847 --> 01:06:35.282
Jesus.

01:06:35.315 --> 01:06:36.782
How did you get home?

01:06:36.815 --> 01:06:38.451
Bus.

01:06:38.485 --> 01:06:39.586
It was the worst
weekend of my life.

01:06:40.853 --> 01:06:43.156
Um, Mom, yeah, he's here.

01:06:44.858 --> 01:06:45.859
No, he's fine.

01:06:48.327 --> 01:06:52.166
No, he didn't stay out at
a strip club all night.

01:06:53.465 --> 01:06:55.469
Mom, I'm gonna
call you back later.

01:06:55.501 --> 01:06:56.737
Okay, bye.

01:06:58.237 --> 01:06:58.873
Jesus.

01:07:00.074 --> 01:07:04.177
God... when you... when you
didn't text me back, I just,

01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:05.711
like, I panicked,
and I thought maybe

01:07:05.744 --> 01:07:06.880
you were bailing
on me or something.

01:07:06.913 --> 01:07:08.148
No.

01:07:09.481 --> 01:07:10.684
I'm sorry I've been
suffocating you,

01:07:10.717 --> 01:07:12.786
and I feel like we
always just talk about me

01:07:12.818 --> 01:07:15.288
and my career, and I just want
you to know that I'm really...

01:07:15.322 --> 01:07:17.291
Babe, can we talk
about this later, please?

01:07:18.291 --> 01:07:18.926
Yeah.

01:07:21.594 --> 01:07:23.763
Okay, but I just
wanna say that

01:07:24.898 --> 01:07:28.302
I want you to have
hobbies and I'm sorry

01:07:28.335 --> 01:07:32.371
if I wasn't interested
in RC cars.

01:07:32.405 --> 01:07:35.776
You know, they still sound
really lame to me.

01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:38.211
But, I shouldn't judge you,
and you shouldn't have to

01:07:38.244 --> 01:07:40.746
make up some bullshit story
about how it's for work.

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:44.952
Mm, work, yeah, it's a
whole different story.

01:07:44.985 --> 01:07:46.753
Why, what happened at work?

01:07:46.786 --> 01:07:48.554
No, nothing, nothing, nothing.

01:07:48.588 --> 01:07:49.590
Really?

01:07:49.623 --> 01:07:50.958
Keep on going.

01:07:54.527 --> 01:07:55.494
That's it, really.

01:07:55.527 --> 01:07:59.899
I just... sorry I was a
bitch on Friday, and...

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.969
...I just want you to know
that I'm all in.

01:08:05.005 --> 01:08:06.240
Okay.

01:08:08.641 --> 01:08:10.844
I gotta close my eyes
because they literally

01:08:11.878 --> 01:08:12.880
feel like they're gonna explode.

01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:43.844
You wanna go and
get some food or something?

01:08:43.877 --> 01:08:45.578
I'm starving.

01:08:46.944 --> 01:08:48.481
Who's Rachel Carhart?

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:50.015
Who?

01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:50.884
Oh, let me see.

01:08:52.585 --> 01:08:55.787
Oh, babe, she... I went
to the RC track yesterday

01:08:55.822 --> 01:08:58.425
and she tagged me in some
photos, it's nothing.

01:08:58.457 --> 01:08:59.992
But who is she?

01:09:00.024 --> 01:09:02.528
It's some chick who
works at the RC car track.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.997
It's... I don't even know her.

01:09:05.029 --> 01:09:07.934
So why is she posting
photos like this

01:09:07.966 --> 01:09:08.902
right before our wedding?

01:09:08.935 --> 01:09:11.004
I don't know why.
Seriously, I don't know.

01:09:11.037 --> 01:09:12.072
She's your friend on here!

01:09:12.104 --> 01:09:14.006
Yeah, everybody's
friends on here!

01:09:14.038 --> 01:09:16.475
It's nothing. I've talked
to her like once or twice.

01:09:16.509 --> 01:09:17.676
Okay, but let's keep looking.

01:09:17.710 --> 01:09:21.613
And, there's like a whole casual
fucking road trip in here!

01:09:21.648 --> 01:09:23.381
No, look, the thing is... okay.

01:09:23.416 --> 01:09:26.819
She's an RC car racer and she
needed a ride to this contest.

01:09:26.853 --> 01:09:29.055
Seriously, it was nothing,
it was not a road trip.

01:09:29.087 --> 01:09:31.557
No, no. Oh my god!

01:09:31.591 --> 01:09:36.029
That was her! At
our fucking house.

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:39.064
Last week when I caught
you trying to jump the car

01:09:39.099 --> 01:09:43.036
and you were supposed to be
at work and that... it was her!

01:09:43.069 --> 01:09:44.237
I don't...

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:46.038
Like I wouldn't notice some
cute girl in our driveway.

01:09:46.072 --> 01:09:47.740
- Okay, look, babe.
- No!

01:09:47.774 --> 01:09:50.410
No, seriously, it's not...
It's nothing, all right?

01:09:50.443 --> 01:09:52.712
We're friends, yes! Okay, we're
friends, I admit it, but...

01:09:52.746 --> 01:09:53.747
Oh my god, stop lying to me!

01:09:53.779 --> 01:09:55.948
I'm not lying. I'm
seriously not lying, okay?

01:09:55.981 --> 01:09:58.585
But you just, you have
to understand, all right,

01:09:58.618 --> 01:10:01.421
that everything is
really heavy right now,

01:10:01.453 --> 01:10:02.956
with the wedding and
with work and stuff,

01:10:02.988 --> 01:10:03.923
so I wanted to have some fun.

01:10:03.957 --> 01:10:06.426
I mean, okay, wait,
no, not fun, but like,

01:10:06.458 --> 01:10:07.760
I wanted to let loose, okay?

01:10:07.793 --> 01:10:08.627
So I went to this contest,

01:10:08.662 --> 01:10:10.130
and I don't know
how to tell you this,

01:10:10.162 --> 01:10:12.665
but Arnon fired me, all right?

01:10:12.698 --> 01:10:14.000
So, when I went to the contest...

01:10:14.033 --> 01:10:16.503
Do you know that last
week I came to your work

01:10:16.536 --> 01:10:18.838
to try to surprise you at
lunch, and your car was gone.

01:10:20.739 --> 01:10:22.943
You were with her,
weren't you?

01:10:22.975 --> 01:10:23.777
With Rachel.

01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:24.778
Maybe, I don't know.

01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:26.880
God, Rachel, I hate
that name! It's such...

01:10:26.912 --> 01:10:28.547
Sadie, I know, hey.

01:10:28.581 --> 01:10:29.349
Hey, listen, listen, listen.

01:10:29.381 --> 01:10:31.518
Look, you have to
trust me, okay?

01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:34.955
It's over. It's done.
I'm yours, all right?

01:10:34.988 --> 01:10:37.658
I'm gonna be the man
that you want, I swear.

01:10:39.091 --> 01:10:40.993
So nothing happened with her?

01:10:43.029 --> 01:10:44.398
Oh my god!

01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:45.998
Sadie, no, it... Look, okay,

01:10:46.032 --> 01:10:47.967
Sadie, Sadie, can you just,
please...

01:10:48.001 --> 01:10:49.903
just listen to me, okay?

01:10:49.935 --> 01:10:51.837
Where are you going?

01:10:51.871 --> 01:10:52.939
You love this car so much,
huh?

01:10:52.971 --> 01:10:54.006
Sadie, please.

01:10:55.041 --> 01:10:57.444
Just take it easy, ma'am.

01:10:57.476 --> 01:10:59.011
I'm looking for Drew
Brighton, does he live here?

01:10:59.045 --> 01:11:00.881
Yeah, what's going on?

01:11:00.913 --> 01:11:03.716
Rachel Carhart has been
reported missing by her father.

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:05.118
She's just my friend.

01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:07.854
Sadie, what's going on?

01:11:07.886 --> 01:11:08.954
Her father
said she ran away with you.

01:11:08.988 --> 01:11:10.990
- No.
- Is she here?

01:11:11.024 --> 01:11:13.660
- No, she's...
- No, just me, his fiancée.

01:11:13.693 --> 01:11:15.762
What'd you do, you probably
raped her, didn't you, Drew?

01:11:17.831 --> 01:11:18.899
Listen, maybe you
should come downtown

01:11:18.931 --> 01:11:19.932
and answer a few
questions for us.

01:11:20.934 --> 01:11:22.002
Yeah, sure, fine.

01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:25.171
Can I get a ride?

01:11:25.204 --> 01:11:26.038
Sure.

01:11:35.914 --> 01:11:37.617
Hey, man,
her dad finally called.

01:11:37.649 --> 01:11:39.219
I guess she wandered
home, but she's safe,

01:11:39.252 --> 01:11:40.521
so you're free to go.

01:12:47.987 --> 01:12:51.024
Yeah, yeah, no,
Mom, I got it, thank you.

01:12:52.591 --> 01:12:53.626
Yeah, I don't know,
it's a nice,

01:12:53.659 --> 01:12:55.528
standard rental car,
you know?

01:12:57.729 --> 01:13:01.067
No, Mom, look,
it's not her fault, okay?

01:13:01.967 --> 01:13:02.969
Yeah, she just left,

01:13:03.002 --> 01:13:03.903
look...

01:13:03.936 --> 01:13:07.073
I fucked it... sorry,
I screwed up, okay?

01:13:08.608 --> 01:13:09.576
I know, Mom,

01:13:09.609 --> 01:13:11.211
look, don't cancel the
flights yet, all right?

01:13:11.243 --> 01:13:12.711
I'm gonna try to talk
to her tonight.

01:13:13.579 --> 01:13:14.780
Alison, please.

01:13:14.814 --> 01:13:16.750
I know Sadie's there, I just
need to talk to her a second.

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:22.289
Hey, asshole!

01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:25.057
Catch.

01:13:33.198 --> 01:13:34.534
Yeah, thanks, Sadie.

01:13:37.103 --> 01:13:39.038
You never even
wore this thing!

01:13:39.072 --> 01:13:43.010
Yeah, five years of editing
and shooting experience.

01:13:44.978 --> 01:13:46.279
Bar mitzvahs and weddings?

01:13:47.846 --> 01:13:51.283
Uh, I'm not sure I'm the
guy who should be

01:13:51.317 --> 01:13:53.752
editing wedding videos.

01:13:53.786 --> 01:13:54.686
Yeah, today.

01:13:56.956 --> 01:13:58.625
Yeah, oh, I'm gonna have
to think about that.

01:13:58.658 --> 01:13:59.826
Can I call you back?

01:13:59.859 --> 01:14:00.694
Thanks.

01:14:02.028 --> 01:14:03.764
Chris, what's up, man?

01:14:04.796 --> 01:14:08.100
Yeah, I wanted to come
by and see you film.

01:14:10.002 --> 01:14:11.604
You're sleeping?

01:14:11.637 --> 01:14:15.074
I thought
you'd be... wait, what?

01:14:47.006 --> 01:14:49.076
Wakey wakey,
hands off snakey.

01:14:51.277 --> 01:14:52.980
Dude, the place is trashed.

01:14:54.012 --> 01:14:56.315
Hey, man.

01:14:56.349 --> 01:14:57.217
Hey, dude.

01:15:02.889 --> 01:15:05.926
Saw you, uh, rented out my
room to some real winners.

01:15:07.426 --> 01:15:10.729
They, uh... pulled
the plug on my show.

01:15:10.762 --> 01:15:11.398
Just like that.

01:15:12.231 --> 01:15:15.734
Just... it turns out
another network

01:15:15.768 --> 01:15:17.637
already had a
sci-fi comedy lined up.

01:15:18.738 --> 01:15:20.840
It was pretty much
the same concept.

01:15:20.872 --> 01:15:22.942
- Bastards.
- Oh, dude.

01:15:24.077 --> 01:15:24.911
Shit.

01:15:26.145 --> 01:15:27.180
Hey, what'd you
do this weekend?

01:15:31.717 --> 01:15:34.787
Dude, this is insane.

01:15:35.954 --> 01:15:37.356
I know.

01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:39.759
- 80 feet into cement.
- Right?

01:15:39.792 --> 01:15:40.927
And, if I would've landed it,

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.997
it probably would've been a
world record or something.

01:15:44.029 --> 01:15:46.331
Do you wanna move back in,
though?

01:15:46.364 --> 01:15:49.135
I could totally kick
these guys out.

01:15:49.167 --> 01:15:50.436
No, no, no. I'm good, man.

01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:55.240
I'll probably end up
moving back to Minnesota.

01:15:55.274 --> 01:15:56.876
Ew, no!

01:15:56.908 --> 01:15:58.411
No no no no, like,
with your parents?

01:15:58.444 --> 01:16:00.346
A guy offered me this today.

01:16:00.378 --> 01:16:03.115
I could be a wedding
video editor.

01:16:04.382 --> 01:16:05.984
Minnesota sounds better.

01:16:06.018 --> 01:16:07.220
I know, right?

01:16:07.252 --> 01:16:09.488
- It's depressing.
- It is.

01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:11.091
Talking to him on
the phone, too,

01:16:11.123 --> 01:16:13.460
just.

01:16:13.493 --> 01:16:15.028
What, so you're
not gonna take it?

01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.095
I dunno.

01:16:18.163 --> 01:16:19.331
Should I?

01:16:19.364 --> 01:16:21.333
Well, dude, give me their
number if you don't want it.

01:16:23.034 --> 01:16:24.436
Just relax,
let me think about it.

01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:25.939
Pull out your phone.

01:16:25.971 --> 01:16:26.907
You got the number right now?

01:16:26.939 --> 01:16:28.841
You're such a little
scavenger, man, god!

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:30.143
Give me the number, man.

01:17:59.064 --> 01:18:00.000
Hey, Dad.

01:18:03.069 --> 01:18:05.305
Yeah, sorry I haven't
called in a while.

01:19:20.046 --> 01:19:21.081
Sadie!

01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:25.085
I can't hear you, stop yelling.

01:19:28.087 --> 01:19:31.057
I... what are you, drunk?

01:20:06.292 --> 01:20:08.094
So where am
I taking you?

01:20:08.127 --> 01:20:09.195
Alison's?

01:20:09.228 --> 01:20:10.063
No.

01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:13.198
So then where am I going?

01:20:15.667 --> 01:20:16.502
Sadie.

01:20:17.737 --> 01:20:18.570
Stay with me.

01:20:20.072 --> 01:20:21.041
I just wanna go home.

01:20:51.069 --> 01:20:52.104
Hey.

01:21:54.132 --> 01:21:55.300
Sadie, Sadie, Sadie.

01:21:58.671 --> 01:21:59.506
What?

01:22:01.841 --> 01:22:04.110
You were right.

01:22:04.143 --> 01:22:06.813
Okay? You were right
about our dumb house.

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.349
Our terrible jobs.

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:12.185
And, uh...

01:22:14.487 --> 01:22:17.190
I can't imagine
my life without you.

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:22.828
Uhm...

01:22:24.363 --> 01:22:26.099
I want you to come
on tour with me.

01:22:31.770 --> 01:22:36.876
You know, we still have time
to be young and be stupid

01:22:36.908 --> 01:22:40.646
and poor and have fun and...

01:22:42.515 --> 01:22:44.184
I don't wanna do it alone.

01:22:51.157 --> 01:22:52.358
I think you should go.

01:23:00.498 --> 01:23:01.333
Babe.

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.238
You gotta go on tour. You
gotta do what you love.

01:23:06.305 --> 01:23:08.108
And, I...

01:23:10.408 --> 01:23:11.710
...I need to figure out my life.

01:23:17.615 --> 01:23:18.818
I love you, babe.

01:23:27.458 --> 01:23:28.627
Take me back to the party.

01:23:31.663 --> 01:23:33.132
Alison's already
on her way.

01:23:39.904 --> 01:23:41.140
What?

01:23:42.807 --> 01:23:44.543
You're such a loser.
