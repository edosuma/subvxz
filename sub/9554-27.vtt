03:07.788 --> 03:08.812
Just calm yourselves.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.448
I was just picked
to be on a jury, huh?

03:11.558 --> 03:13.424
All right? Chachi, go ahead.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.757
Due to the fact that the Fonz
has been picked for jury duty,

03:15.862 --> 03:17.125
he will not be available

03:17.230 --> 03:19.096
for any daytime dates
for a while.

my civic responsibility.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.473

03:31.812 --> 03:33.643
All girls having
a date with the Fonz

03:33.747 --> 03:36.341
that have cancelled,
will get rain checks.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.382
RICHIE:
The girls get rain checks, Fonz?

03:40.487 --> 03:42.353
Yeah.
Maybe it's more, more democratic

03:42.456 --> 03:43.946
if I take them all out together.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.321
I think the rain checks
are more democratic.

03:46.426 --> 03:47.985
You think so? Thanks a lot, Al.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.687
I'll tell you something.

03:49.796 --> 03:52.493
This is my first time on a jury
and I happen to be

03:52.599 --> 03:54.363
-(sing-songy): nervous.
- Ah.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.835
I was nervous the first time
I was on jury duty, too.

03:57.938 --> 03:58.871
What happened?

03:58.972 --> 04:01.634
Well, it was
an open and shut case.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.438
We sent this guy
to prison for 20 years.

04:04.544 --> 04:07.070
That was back in 1939.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.842
He's out!

04:11.952 --> 04:13.317
Clarence!

04:13.420 --> 04:15.479
Did you see anybody
suspicious around?

04:16.690 --> 04:18.658
You know something?

04:18.759 --> 04:21.023
Your dad is serving the country
by being on myjury,

04:21.128 --> 04:23.119
- He was just picked today.
- Oh, yeah?

04:23.230 --> 04:25.061
He's got
this paint sale tomorrow.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.758
And he was hoping
that they'd let him off.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.892
Well, I'll tell you something.
He mentioned that to the judge.

04:29.002 --> 04:32.029
Now, by the way, what does, uh,
"in contempt of court" mean?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.071
It means he's gonna be
on the jury.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.233
Yeah, that's cool.

04:36.343 --> 04:37.810
Oh look, Fonz,
we're very excited

04:37.911 --> 04:39.174
about your-your being
picked and everything,

04:39.279 --> 04:40.974
- That's nice. -but we gotta
come up with a song.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.072
We got this song festival,
and we need one.

04:43.183 --> 04:45.652
Well, uh,
what's your favorite song?

04:47.053 --> 04:49.022
"America the Beautiful."

Hey, thanks a lot.
I hope I don't look too nice.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.868
Hey, since we're both going
to the courthouse,

08:31.978 --> 08:34.140
how about if I give you a ride
on my motorcycle?

08:34.246 --> 08:36.544
- No thanks, Fonz. -All right,
I promise, no wheelies.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.583
No, I'd just
as soon take my car.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.653
All right, then forget
about style, huh?

08:40.754 --> 08:41.846

08:53.333 --> 08:56.098
Members of the jury, you've
heard both the prosecution

08:56.202 --> 08:57.932
and the defense
present their cases.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.938
And now, based on that evidence,

09:00.040 --> 09:02.304
it is time
for you to deliberate.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.673
- Why even bother?
-(gavel bangs)

09:04.778 --> 09:07.577
Will the defendant
please come to order?

09:07.680 --> 09:10.343
Maybe you'll get order,
but you won't get justice.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.851
Now, I didn't take her purse--
I keep telling you,

09:12.952 --> 09:14.579
-you got the wrong man.
-(gavel bangs)

09:14.687 --> 09:17.680
The bailiff will remove the
defendant from the courtroom.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.624
Look, I keep telling you,
a guy on a motorcycle

09:20.727 --> 09:23.423
dropped the purse
as he drove by me.

09:23.530 --> 09:27.330
Oh, why bother? You guys
got it in for cyclists, anyway.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.800
Aw, you want to take me out now?

09:29.903 --> 09:32.667
Those people really know
how to put on a show, huh?

09:32.772 --> 09:34.069
(gavel bangs)

09:34.174 --> 09:36.165
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

09:36.276 --> 09:39.109
your decision should be based
solely upon the evidence.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.113
Please disregard
the defendant's remarks.

09:42.215 --> 09:45.082
Because of circumstances
beyond our control,

09:45.185 --> 09:47.085
the jury room is not available.

09:47.187 --> 09:51.180
So you'll have to remain here
to deliberate.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.191
This shouldn't take long.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.887
At this time,
the court will be in recess

09:55.995 --> 09:59.193
until such a time as the jury
finds the defendant,

09:59.299 --> 10:02.996
Jason Davis,
guilty or not guilty

10:03.103 --> 10:05.094
beyond any reasonable doubt.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.140
The bailiff
will clear the courtroom,

10:08.241 --> 10:09.140
except for the jury.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.232
(bangs gavel)

10:13.680 --> 10:15.978
Hey.

10:16.082 --> 10:17.846
- Eh!
- Oh...

10:21.688 --> 10:24.418
Five years I wanted
to get on a jury,

10:24.524 --> 10:26.652
and I get
a purse-snatching case.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.489
I wanted to do
the death penalty.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.085
I wanted fun.

10:31.598 --> 10:34.863
Well, we're real sorry
that we're spoiling your fun.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.095
A man's freedom
is on the line here.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.832
Aw, forget it. Let's get
this whole thing over with, huh?

10:39.939 --> 10:41.236
- Yeah...
- It's almost 5:00.

10:41.341 --> 10:44.140
Mr. Foreman, could you read
the votes so we can go home?

10:44.244 --> 10:46.235
We all know he's guilty.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.712
(low, indistinct chatter)

10:48.815 --> 10:52.911
What we have here
are 11 guilties...

10:53.019 --> 10:56.353
and one "not-guilty-a-mundo."

10:58.000 --> 11:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:10.303 --> 11:11.771
All right, who is the weirdo

11:11.871 --> 11:14.204
who voted
"not-guilty-a-mundo," huh?

11:14.307 --> 11:15.468
Aaayyhg

11:15.575 --> 11:17.543
HOWARD:
There will be...

11:17.644 --> 11:20.909
there will be
no name-calling on myjury.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.777
Now, look...

11:22.882 --> 11:25.852
I mean, it appears to me that
you're not too worried about

11:25.952 --> 11:28.819
whether you send an innocent man
to jail or not, right?

11:28.922 --> 11:32.085
You all want to get home to your
middle-class homes so quickly.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.956
All right, but at least
let's go over the facts.

11:35.061 --> 11:37.928
We all know the facts: the kid's
guilty; that's the facts.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.191
(low, indistinct chatter)

11:39.299 --> 11:40.493
Guilty is a verdict.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.227
Guilty's is not a fact.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.599
Huh? Huh?
(chuckles)

11:44.704 --> 11:49.540
Look, I happen to think
that Mr. Davis is not guilty.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.201
Mr. Davis?

11:51.311 --> 11:54.246
Oh-ho, now I know
why you're fighting for him.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.315
He's another one
of those bikers.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.714
And none of you are any good.

11:58.818 --> 12:01.151
Fonzie...

12:01.254 --> 12:02.653
HOWARD:
Sit down, Burch.

12:04.023 --> 12:06.424
Now, look, if there's
one member of this jury

12:06.526 --> 12:08.790
who happens to think
that the defendant is innocent,

12:08.895 --> 12:11.227
well, then he's got
a right to be heard.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.424
Thanks a lot, Mr. C.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.866
What's the big deal, Fonzie?
I mean... (speaks quietly)

12:16.970 --> 12:19.837
Hey, look, it is just like
the defense lawyer said--

12:19.939 --> 12:22.431
it is "circumventive" evidence.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.806
- That's circumstantial evidence.
- Or whatever.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.175
I got a gut feeling, Mr. C.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.180
But it's not the same thing.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.182
A gut feeling is a gut feeling.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.878
It's the same one I had
when I was just thinking

12:33.987 --> 12:35.454
about dating
the Hooper triplets.

12:35.555 --> 12:39.719
I had two yesses and a maybe,
but I stuck it out.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.384
- What happened?
- Later.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.518
Oh.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.790
Can we get on with this?

12:44.897 --> 12:46.331
MALE JUROR:
Yeah.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.526
All right.
You want jurisprudence?

12:48.635 --> 12:49.829
I'll give you jurisprudence.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.904
With a little mixture
of evidence, all right?

12:52.005 --> 12:53.871
Now, look, the eyewitness

12:53.973 --> 12:55.737
couldn't even give us
the license plate number.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.435
She couldn't even tell you

12:57.543 --> 12:59.478
what kind of bike
the man was riding.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.105
She identified the man
by the helmet-- right here.

13:03.349 --> 13:04.942
Exhibit A, all right?

13:05.051 --> 13:06.450
Now, look, I want to try
a little experiment,

13:06.552 --> 13:08.179
I'm going to put on
Exhibit A, all right?

13:08.288 --> 13:11.621
Now, when the guy
was driving away,

13:11.724 --> 13:12.953
he was in this position.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.527
Tell me...

13:14.627 --> 13:16.095
what color are my eyes?

13:16.195 --> 13:18.391
But Fonzie,
we can't see your face.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.022
Correct-a-mundo.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.592
The eyewitness couldn't see
the man's face, either.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.068
She identified the helmet.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.866
I'm telling you,
Milwaukee is filled

13:26.973 --> 13:28.202
with this kind of helmet.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.674
Oh, yeah, but don't forget...

13:30.777 --> 13:32.540
that guy was caught
two blocks away

13:32.645 --> 13:34.511
going through
Mrs. Leary's purse.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.605
And don't forget,
that guy said that he was

13:36.716 --> 13:39.481
going through the purse
looking for identification.

13:39.585 --> 13:41.611
They will say anything.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.951
Now wait a minute, Burch.

13:44.057 --> 13:47.424
The judge happened to say
"reasonable doubt,"

13:47.527 --> 13:48.756
and it's quite obvious here

13:48.861 --> 13:50.591
that Fonzie has
a reasonable doubt.

13:50.697 --> 13:51.891
Correct-a-mundo.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.864
Oh, "mundo" again.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.060
Are you sure
you're an American, huh?

13:58.705 --> 14:02.300
Right down to my red,
white and blue socks.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.910
BURCH:
Look...

14:12.018 --> 14:13.486
I say, let's stop fooling around

14:13.586 --> 14:14.986
and string this guy...

14:16.989 --> 14:20.255
No, I mean, let's get
this thing over with

14:20.360 --> 14:21.918
so we can all go home, right?

14:22.028 --> 14:23.291
- Yeah. -Yeah, let's go.
- Let's get out of here.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.296
All right, all right.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.161
It looks like you don't care--
that's fine.

14:27.266 --> 14:28.495
Let's take another vote.

14:28.601 --> 14:29.625
Good.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.363
And if you all think

14:31.471 --> 14:34.201
that Mr. Davis is guilty,
then, uh...

14:34.307 --> 14:36.400
I'll vote the same way.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.307
All right,
let's have a show of hands.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.675
All those for guilty,
put 'em up.

14:41.848 --> 14:44.578
What about you, Mr. Foreman?

14:44.684 --> 14:46.584
- I vote not guilty.
- What?

14:46.686 --> 14:48.119
Hey, I convinced you,
huh, Mr. C.?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.711
No, you didn't convince me,
Fonzie.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.916
I still think he's guilty.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.925
But I'm not going
to put a man in jail

14:54.026 --> 14:55.688
just because I'm
in a hurry to get home.

14:55.795 --> 14:58.287
Hey, attaboy, Mr. C.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.730
What color are your socks?

15:06.339 --> 15:08.899
Hey, I-I'm doing
pretty good, huh?

15:09.008 --> 15:11.067
- Wasn't I good today?
- Oh...

15:11.177 --> 15:14.408
You were so good
we gotta go back tomorrow.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.209
Try and figure out
what this thing is...

15:16.315 --> 15:18.011
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...
- Oh.

15:18.117 --> 15:19.778
Can't I even talk to my wife?

15:19.886 --> 15:22.650
Hey, the judge says we don't
discuss this case with nobody.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.918
Oh, good,
you got a juicy trial.

15:26.025 --> 15:27.755
Yes, we've got
a juicy trial, Marion,

15:27.860 --> 15:29.191
and Fonzie here is the one...

15:29.295 --> 15:30.456
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.123
Mm-mm.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.791
I tell you something, Mrs. C,

15:34.901 --> 15:37.062
there is something about
this case that is bugging me.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.331
I'm going down to the "liberry"
to study up on jurisprudence,

15:39.439 --> 15:40.633
-you know.
- Uh-uh. -Uh-uh.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.766
Hey, hey. The rule
in the "liberry" is silence.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.867
Hey.

15:46.913 --> 15:49.746
Well, how did
the paint sale go, huh?

15:49.849 --> 15:52.215
Oh, the paint sale!
It was such fun.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.309
Fun?!

15:55.188 --> 15:56.382
Oh, it started slow,

15:56.489 --> 15:57.820
and then I just did

15:57.924 --> 15:59.653
the same thing
that the drugstore does.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.625
I had a one-cent sale.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.957
You had a one-cent sale?

16:08.067 --> 16:10.229
Well, I wasn't sure the idea
would work at first,

16:10.336 --> 16:12.566
but I just said,
"Marion, why not?"

16:12.672 --> 16:14.902
And, Howard, you know what?

16:15.007 --> 16:18.466
I sold out
your entire inventory.

16:20.847 --> 16:26.149
You mean you sold half of
my inventory for a penny a can?

16:26.252 --> 16:27.151
(chortling)

16:27.253 --> 16:29.085
I can't believe this!

16:29.188 --> 16:31.885
You drove me to bankruptcy
while I'm locked up

16:31.991 --> 16:34.358
-in a courtroom trying to...
- Ah, ah, ah.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.689
(sighs)

16:35.795 --> 16:38.093
I'm broke, I can't talk--

16:38.197 --> 16:40.359
what else can happen to me?

16:40.466 --> 16:43.527
All right,
the Three Caballeros are ready!

16:43.636 --> 16:46.230
That's what else could happen
to me!

16:46.339 --> 16:48.239
JOANIE: Okay, boys, make it
good! We have an audience!

16:48.341 --> 16:49.240
(Howard groans)

16:49.342 --> 16:50.900
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:51.010 --> 16:52.910
from Alpha Tau Omega,

16:53.012 --> 16:54.912
the Three Caballeros!

18:04.016 --> 18:05.575
BURCH:
Aw, come on,

18:05.685 --> 18:06.777
talk, talk, talk.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.252
Another "not guilty-a-mundo."

18:09.355 --> 18:12.416
Look, I don't care
about Mr. Fonzareeny.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.856
Fonzarelli.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.860
Whatever-arelli.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.827
The guy is guilty.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.059
No, he is not.

18:22.868 --> 18:25.895
Fonzie, I've given you
every opportunity

18:26.005 --> 18:27.632
to express your views.

18:27.740 --> 18:31.040
Now, unfortunately,
your gut feelings of innocence

18:31.143 --> 18:33.476
do not negate the facts
in this case.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.206
What's "negate" mean?

18:35.314 --> 18:37.180
"Negate" means "deny."

18:37.283 --> 18:39.376
Hey, good word, good word.

18:39.485 --> 18:40.714
Quiet.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.344
Another good word.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.615
Now, look, unless you come up
with some hard facts

18:46.726 --> 18:49.286
to prove that the defendant
is innocent,

18:49.395 --> 18:51.420
then I'm gonna have
to take another vote.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.365
(Howard sighs)

18:54.467 --> 18:55.957
All right.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.627
All right,
let's take another vote.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.228
All those who say
that the defendant is guilty,

19:00.339 --> 19:03.707
raise your hands.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.641
All right, let the record show

19:05.745 --> 19:07.269
that we find that
the defendant is guilty...

19:07.380 --> 19:09.348
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

19:09.448 --> 19:11.144
Oh, here we go again.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.344
No, wait a minute, please--
just wait a minute.

19:13.452 --> 19:16.422
Look, it says right here
in the transcript,

19:16.522 --> 19:20.755
Jason Davis was riding
a Graham Mark Two motorcycle

19:20.860 --> 19:22.225
when he was picked up.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.353
- We know that, Fonzie.
- That's right.

19:24.463 --> 19:26.159
You know that,
but do you know, Mr. C.,

19:26.265 --> 19:29.098
that the Graham Mark Two
is a very rare bike,

19:29.201 --> 19:31.500
and it's only made in England?

19:31.604 --> 19:33.163
That's another thing wrong
with him.

19:33.272 --> 19:35.366
He don't even buy American.

19:35.474 --> 19:36.498
Whoa.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.372
Madam, would you
come here, please, huh?

19:38.477 --> 19:39.672
Just step right over here,
help me out.

19:39.779 --> 19:40.803
That's right.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.109
And hold on to Exhibit B,
the handbag.

19:43.215 --> 19:44.911
Okay, look.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.782
Mrs. Leary is standing
in the parking lot,

19:47.887 --> 19:49.650
holding her little handbag,
right?

19:49.755 --> 19:53.453
Okay, now Jason supposedly
whips by and grabs the--

19:53.559 --> 19:54.788
You're supposed to let go
of the purse, ma'am.

19:54.894 --> 19:55.986
Oh.

19:56.095 --> 19:56.994
Thanks so much.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.188
Whips by, grabs the bag

19:58.297 --> 20:00.027
and holds it up, right?

20:00.132 --> 20:01.600
So?

20:02.635 --> 20:04.865
Come here.

20:04.970 --> 20:08.463
I hate it when people say,
(mocking tone): "So?"

20:12.078 --> 20:13.238
All right...

20:13.345 --> 20:15.007
Now, dig it; now, dig it--

20:15.114 --> 20:16.582
this is the important part.

20:16.682 --> 20:19.845
The criminal was supposed
to have had the handbag

20:19.952 --> 20:22.319
in his left hand.

20:22.421 --> 20:23.616
Well, naturally.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.987
He had to accelerate the bike
with his right hand.

20:26.092 --> 20:28.720
And there's the rub,
ladies and gentlemen.

20:28.828 --> 20:32.389
The Graham Mark Two,
made in England,

20:32.498 --> 20:36.799
has the accelerator
on the left-hand handlebar.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.666
Now, how can Jason Davis

20:38.771 --> 20:41.866
grab the bag, hold it up
in-in his left hand

20:41.974 --> 20:44.068
and accelerate
with the same hand?

20:44.176 --> 20:46.167
With two left hands? He can't.

20:46.278 --> 20:48.178
I rest my case.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.976
Thank you very much.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.147
Let me see this.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.486
That's what's been bugging me
the whole time, Mr. C.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.082
You're right, Fonzie.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.753
It says here that he held up
the purse in his left hand.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.888
Right.
Now, due to the-the evidence

21:05.998 --> 21:08.296
that I've exposed here
to you ladies and gentlemen,

21:08.400 --> 21:10.835
it is impossible
for you to find

21:10.936 --> 21:14.304
Jason Davis guilty.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.170
HOWARD:
Well,

21:16.275 --> 21:17.606
in light
of this new information,

21:17.710 --> 21:19.143
I think we should take
another vote.

21:19.245 --> 21:20.678
- FONZIE: Yeah.
- Hold it. Th-There's still

21:20.780 --> 21:22.179
a little something wrong here.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.578
Only for you.

21:23.682 --> 21:26.777
Mr. Davis can't change
his color. Sorry.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.786
HOWARD:
All right.

21:28.888 --> 21:32.324
All those who vote that
the defendant is not guilty,

21:32.424 --> 21:35.326
raise your hands.

21:35.427 --> 21:36.986
We'll let the record show

21:37.096 --> 21:39.724
that the defendant
is not guilty...

21:39.832 --> 21:42.824
-a-mundo.
- Heyyy.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.838
Do I know my jurisprudence
or do I know my jurisprudence?

21:49.942 --> 21:50.841
Was I not great?

21:50.943 --> 21:52.172
Well, you got him acquitted.

21:52.278 --> 21:54.212
- You did fine, Fonzie.
- Yeah.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.543
I had a great time, but I'm out.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.209
Say, listen,
weren't you on the jury?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.150
Hey, I really want to thank you.

22:01.253 --> 22:04.246
I really want to thank you.

22:05.791 --> 22:07.782
Mm!

22:10.196 --> 22:11.754
Hey, I want
to thank you guys also.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.560
You know, I didn't think
I had a chance in there.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.158
Well, our court system seems
to work a lot better

22:17.269 --> 22:20.501
when you look upon jury duty
as a privilege and not a chore.

22:20.606 --> 22:23.007
- Hey, no objection there, Mr. C.
- Mm.

22:23.108 --> 22:25.270
Oh, and speaking of chores,
I think I better get back

22:25.377 --> 22:27.607
to the store.
I got to get Marion out of there

22:27.713 --> 22:30.512
before I have to have
a going-out-of-business sale.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.050
- I'll see you.
- See you later. -Take it easy.

22:32.151 --> 22:33.983
- Say, you're a biker,
aren't you? -Yeah, that's right.

22:34.086 --> 22:34.985
Want to make
something of it?

22:35.087 --> 22:36.248
- No.
- Just kidding.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.585
Let me ask you a question.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.057
That beautiful bike
you got there, you ever race it?

22:41.160 --> 22:42.992
Oh, yeah. I race that,
stock cars...

22:43.095 --> 22:45.257
See, I got this dream
of being the first black driver

22:45.364 --> 22:47.526
in the Indy 500.

22:47.633 --> 22:50.466
I'll tell you something, man,
that would be a milestone.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.162
- You tell it.
- I hope you make it.

22:52.271 --> 22:53.602
- I will. I promise you.
- All right.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.266
Hold up.
How'd you find such a rare bike?

22:56.375 --> 22:57.934
How'd you get your hands
on that?

22:58.043 --> 22:58.942
I stole it.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.705
Whoa!

23:00.813 --> 23:03.111
- I'm kidding.
- I knew that. I knew that.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.247
What happened
to Richie's parrot?

23:12.358 --> 23:15.191
Oh, brother. What a jerk.

23:15.294 --> 23:18.059
And the goat?
(laughs)

23:18.163 --> 23:19.290
Yeah.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.524
I'll see you tomorrow, Jenny.

23:20.633 --> 23:21.759
Thanks a lot.

23:21.867 --> 23:22.925
Oh, brother.

23:23.035 --> 23:23.934
(chuckles)

23:24.036 --> 23:25.094
What happened, dear?

23:25.204 --> 23:27.798
Well, the caballeros
were onstage singing,

23:27.907 --> 23:29.306
and, uh...

23:29.408 --> 23:31.399
Hey, Rich.

23:32.945 --> 23:35.107
This parrot has seen
its last cracker.

23:35.214 --> 23:36.147
Tell Mom about it.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.943
It's really funny.
(laughs)

23:39.685 --> 23:41.778
How was I supposed to know
that Pi Nu

23:41.887 --> 23:44.220
had a live falcon
for a mascot?

23:47.893 --> 23:50.624
Oh, that's terrible.

23:50.729 --> 23:53.756
Well-well, how did you do
in the contest?

23:55.501 --> 23:58.402
Only one group came in below us.

23:58.504 --> 24:01.064
- MARION: Aw...
- Kappa Kappa Kappa.

24:01.173 --> 24:03.506
They didn't show up.

24:05.577 --> 24:07.409
But Jenny already told me
about that.

24:07.513 --> 24:10.141
But did they get Ralph
out of the bass drum?

24:11.917 --> 24:14.477
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Oh, Howard.

24:14.586 --> 24:16.077
How did Richie do
in the contest?

24:16.188 --> 24:18.953
He... was runner-up.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.616
I don't know how.

24:20.726 --> 24:23.286
Listen, I've been going over
the books down at the store,

24:23.395 --> 24:25.694
and I can't for the life of me
figure out

24:25.798 --> 24:28.631
how you turned a penny sale
into a profit.

24:28.734 --> 24:29.894
Howard, it's simple.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.368
It's like baked potatoes.

24:35.341 --> 24:37.206
Baked potatoes?

24:37.309 --> 24:38.709
Yes. When you eat
baked potatoes,

24:38.811 --> 24:40.904
you're gonna need salt
and pepper and butter,

24:41.013 --> 24:44.176
sour cream, chives...
and when you paint,

24:44.283 --> 24:46.183
you're gonna need
turpentine, drop cloths,

24:46.285 --> 24:48.344
brushes, buckets, rollers...

24:48.454 --> 24:52.891
You make your money
on the chives and sour cream.
