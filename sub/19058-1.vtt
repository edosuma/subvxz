<i>The world was not round,
not from where I stood...</i>

00:14.264 --> 00:17.282
<i>...watching the sun wither into the shadows.</i>

00:17.883 --> 00:20.918
<i>It left me knee deep in the winter water.</i>

00:21.421 --> 00:24.223
<i>I used to be comfortable in the dark...</i>

00:24.624 --> 00:27.625
<i>...listening to the wind scream and howl...</i>

00:27.727 --> 00:30.728
<i>...snapping branches off family trees...</i>

00:30.808 --> 00:33.084
<i>...casting them down stream...</i>

00:33.165 --> 00:35.498
<i>...into the mouth of the Mississippi...</i>

01:19.094 --> 01:21.095
What if she doesn't like me?

01:21.297 --> 01:23.872
It don't matter if she's likes you, man.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.766
She loves me.

01:26.168 --> 01:28.445
She would do it if I ask her to.

01:29.905 --> 01:33.742
Besides, you're my little brother.

01:35.044 --> 01:36.917
Wherever I go...

01:38.301 --> 01:40.257
...you go.

01:40.337 --> 01:41.935
Okay?

01:42.818 --> 01:44.973
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

01:45.053 --> 01:47.478
All right. Don't call me sir, faggot.

01:47.557 --> 01:49.367
Fuck you.

01:53.996 --> 01:55.830
What if I don't like her?

01:56.031 --> 01:57.687
I thought you said you liked her.

01:57.767 --> 02:00.735
What if she doesn't like me,
or what if I change my mind?

02:00.836 --> 02:03.324
No, no, no. No, man. It's easy.

02:03.403 --> 02:07.548
Once you're inside, all you
got to do is pump like this. Look.

02:09.812 --> 02:11.611
Check it.

02:15.951 --> 02:19.586
- Don't laugh at me.
- No, man. No, no, no. Look.

02:20.924 --> 02:23.946
It's like this, okay. Boom.
You start with the titties.

02:24.027 --> 02:26.449
- Okay.
- Start with the titties first. Okay?

02:26.529 --> 02:29.719
And you work your way down.
How you doing? Over there.

02:29.799 --> 02:32.576
Okay. Then you go. Yeah.

02:33.135 --> 02:35.658
Then you turn and you go, boom. Boom.

02:35.738 --> 02:38.542
- I'm going to butter your biscuits, bitch.
- Oh, yeah.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.314
Hey, Nana!

02:41.644 --> 02:43.454
Hey, Nana!

02:47.582 --> 02:49.459
Hey, Nana!

02:52.487 --> 02:54.010
Hey.

02:55.090 --> 02:58.414
What the fuck are you yelling for?
You're trying to wake up my mother?

02:58.494 --> 03:01.066
Well, shit, we ain't got all day.

03:01.146 --> 03:03.028
Hey, Asher.

03:13.741 --> 03:16.031
<i>The world is warped.</i>

03:16.111 --> 03:19.937
<i>My brother, Chester, he taught me that.</i>

03:20.416 --> 03:23.272
<i>Chester said love is for the weak.</i>

03:23.452 --> 03:25.308
<i>I disagree.</i>

03:25.889 --> 03:28.096
<i>I think he's dead wrong.</i>

03:28.757 --> 03:31.781
Don't you think it's a little weird
with your brother watching?

03:32.262 --> 03:35.684
Look, buddy, I'm going in with her.

03:35.764 --> 03:39.088
You just look through the window
and you take notes. Okay?

03:39.168 --> 03:42.163
Goddamn it. It's fucking cold.

03:42.739 --> 03:44.827
You're my foot soldier.

03:44.908 --> 03:46.429
Remember?

03:47.209 --> 03:48.786
Yeah.

03:55.752 --> 03:58.028
Keep an eye out for any trouble, man.

04:03.591 --> 04:06.069
<i>'Cause I seen it with my own eyes.</i>

04:13.769 --> 04:16.456
<i>Just as clears as I see a slug...</i>

04:16.536 --> 04:20.219
<i>...slither from one wall to another...</i>

04:21.700 --> 04:26.101
<i>...it's like being sucked into
the bottom of a bottomless pit...</i>

04:26.581 --> 04:28.996
<i>...only to be spat out again.</i>

04:43.865 --> 04:46.409
<i>She saw my silhouette...</i>

04:47.707 --> 04:50.566
<i>...my shadow behind the glass.</i>

04:56.712 --> 05:00.123
<i>Nothing more than a smudge
of a boy in the dark.</i>

05:04.452 --> 05:08.797
<i>I smell blood and rain and mud...</i>

05:11.648 --> 05:13.696
<i>...but I hear nothing.</i>

05:13.976 --> 05:18.241
<i>My father's fingers ripped me out
of the ground like something rotten.</i>

05:21.869 --> 05:24.628
<i>My ears rang out...</i>

05:27.411 --> 05:32.551
<i>...like the whole world
was screaming at once.</i>

05:38.586 --> 05:41.633
God, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait...

05:43.293 --> 05:45.782
Why you fucking cheating on me, girl?

05:46.261 --> 05:48.106
With my son?

05:53.117 --> 05:55.395
I'll fucking kill you!

06:04.011 --> 06:07.424
<i>This is my father's way
of silencing the world.</i>

06:11.420 --> 06:14.744
<i>A vain attempt to prove himself a god.</i>

06:15.624 --> 06:18.938
<i>If only the emotions I felt were natural...</i>

06:20.195 --> 06:23.407
<i>...natural in the same way
venom is to the snake.</i>

06:30.638 --> 06:33.917
<i>The ground tried to swallow me up.</i>

06:39.880 --> 06:43.535
<i>Mother Earth knows like moves in cycles.</i>

06:44.681 --> 06:49.044
<i>Even Tank knew better to stop
what was already in motion.</i>

06:49.605 --> 06:53.152
<i>I spent years together killing Viet Cong.</i>

06:57.065 --> 07:00.490
<i>My hands knotted into little fists...</i>

07:00.569 --> 07:03.792
<i>...and I screamed with my first deaf word.</i>

07:04.172 --> 07:05.821
<i>Chester.</i>

07:07.101 --> 07:08.719
<i>Chester.</i>

07:19.353 --> 07:22.232
<i>But Chester was gone.</i>

09:34.555 --> 09:39.223
<i>By the power of the almighty,
let these men break free...</i>

09:40.404 --> 09:42.308
<i>...in Jesus' name.</i>

09:42.387 --> 09:44.357
<i>All men are free!</i>

09:44.436 --> 09:45.888
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

09:45.969 --> 09:48.191
Amazing, ain't it, Asher?

09:48.270 --> 09:50.948
It's amazing what the Lord can do.

09:53.107 --> 09:56.993
I said it's amazing what the Lord
can do, ain't it, Asher?

09:59.013 --> 10:01.235
<i>Deliver his message.</i>

10:01.315 --> 10:04.907
<i>Told me to start the temple of bodily saints.</i>

10:04.988 --> 10:09.888
Oh, yeah. And skin that gator
before he starts to rot.

10:10.859 --> 10:13.136
It's been a day already.

10:19.767 --> 10:22.787
Oh, and, Asher. Hey, Asher!

10:24.617 --> 10:26.654
Take out the trash.

10:34.017 --> 10:35.520
Lazy.

10:36.351 --> 10:38.357
Lazy since the day he was born.

10:38.438 --> 10:43.097
<i>Jesus is good to me.
Buck, would you lead us in?</i>

11:22.396 --> 11:25.885
I know this is unexpected, and I'm sorry.

11:27.329 --> 11:29.292
Don't make me no happier.

11:30.072 --> 11:31.305
No.

11:33.108 --> 11:34.649
No.

11:35.944 --> 11:38.389
- No.
- Hello, Asher.

11:42.416 --> 11:44.695
You know hunting season's done, right?

11:47.154 --> 11:50.467
Have a seat, son. This is hard.

11:51.893 --> 11:55.353
Asher, the reason I'm here...

11:55.433 --> 11:58.872
...I got to notify
all the necessary people that...

11:59.903 --> 12:02.714
...your father got out
earlier this evening...

12:03.193 --> 12:06.916
...due to overcrowding and good behavior.

12:22.857 --> 12:25.314
When you say necessary people...

12:25.694 --> 12:27.971
...you mean that little whore, don't you?

12:28.830 --> 12:30.669
Yes, ma'am.

12:30.999 --> 12:33.057
All necessary people.

12:35.037 --> 12:37.993
Now look, I know he had
four more years, but...

12:38.073 --> 12:39.595
No.

12:40.726 --> 12:43.370
Judge put a restraint order on him.

13:00.761 --> 13:02.784
Where is he now?

13:03.564 --> 13:06.038
No, I ain't seen them in a while.

13:07.469 --> 13:11.928
Man, I'll tell ya, a lot has changed
around here since you've been away.

13:12.708 --> 13:16.364
So you look like you haven't aged a day.

13:16.804 --> 13:18.643
You look great, man.

13:19.815 --> 13:22.619
- You need another one?
- Why not?

13:24.538 --> 13:26.541
It's a lot quieter around here.

13:27.521 --> 13:30.371
And I seen all the boys from the club house.

13:43.270 --> 13:44.893
Why don't you put that one on my tab, Russ?

13:44.973 --> 13:48.006
- Hey, Lawny.
- I'll take one too.

13:48.810 --> 13:50.427
My name's Lawny.

13:51.146 --> 13:53.618
I haven't seen you around here before.

13:53.699 --> 13:55.542
Thank you, Russ.

13:57.818 --> 13:59.480
To...

14:00.645 --> 14:04.308
...shit, friends, family and fornication?

14:12.099 --> 14:13.977
Thank you, Russ.

14:14.870 --> 14:19.085
You know, my old man
used to work in a distillery.

14:20.008 --> 14:22.270
And he always told me...

14:22.350 --> 14:24.921
...whiskey is good at year 12...

14:25.279 --> 14:27.364
...but it's better at 17.

14:31.552 --> 14:35.598
He would always say, boy,
you'll go blind you drink that shit.

14:38.091 --> 14:41.692
But... but he also told me I'd go blind...

14:41.773 --> 14:45.189
...if I fiddle with my flesh fluid
too much too.

14:47.168 --> 14:49.019
Look at me now.

14:50.638 --> 14:52.515
I got 20/20 vision.

14:55.676 --> 14:57.921
I'm a goddamn miracle over here.

14:59.546 --> 15:02.572
<i>There were whispers about
how my father came to be.</i>

15:03.352 --> 15:06.809
<i>Some say he was born and left for dead...</i>

15:07.589 --> 15:11.314
<i>...under a rotten sycamore by a whore, 17...</i>

15:11.393 --> 15:15.282
<i>...only to be found and raised
by a descendant of the slave...</i>

15:15.662 --> 15:19.721
<i>...who beat generations upon generations...</i>

15:19.801 --> 15:22.660
<i>...of his relatives' resentments...</i>

15:22.740 --> 15:25.181
<i>...into the bones of the boy.</i>

15:25.807 --> 15:30.700
<i>What I do know is that my father
was a ferocious fighter...</i>

15:31.381 --> 15:33.335
<i>...had great potential.</i>

15:33.415 --> 15:36.438
<i>Mama said he could have gone
all the way to the top.</i>

15:36.918 --> 15:40.376
<i>Said the safest place
for him was in the ring.</i>

15:41.156 --> 15:45.179
<i>She blamed America
for sending him into the jungle.</i>

15:45.259 --> 15:48.917
<i>I blame Vietnam for not
bringing him home in a box.</i>

15:48.997 --> 15:50.874
Hey, man, hold up.

15:52.266 --> 15:53.922
Some cigarettes.

15:54.002 --> 15:57.159
Where are you headed off to
in such a hurry there, man?

15:57.238 --> 16:00.028
You need a ride somewhere? I'll give a ride.

16:00.108 --> 16:03.365
Look, I don't mean to speak
out of line or anything...

16:03.445 --> 16:06.219
...but didn't your daddy ever teach you
it's rude to walk out on a man...

16:06.298 --> 16:08.504
...just after he bought you a drink?

16:09.918 --> 16:12.580
Oh, you're in trouble,
and you need some saving?

16:13.655 --> 16:16.136
Well, maybe you don't need it...

16:16.216 --> 16:19.847
...but I could tell from the way you looked
at me in there that you definitely want it.

16:20.328 --> 16:24.375
I think you're just... shy timing.

16:29.403 --> 16:33.428
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

16:33.508 --> 16:35.552
You fucking idiot.

16:38.813 --> 16:44.038
Don't fucking move. You just assaulted
a goddamn police officer, horse.

16:44.118 --> 16:47.990
Now, why don't you drop that fucking bag,
put your hands in the air...

16:48.069 --> 16:51.581
...and why don't you wheedle
your faggot ass over to that car.

16:51.660 --> 16:54.483
That's right, fucking move
to the fucking car.

16:54.562 --> 16:58.442
Spread your fucking legs. Now, you're going
to spread your fucking legs for me, right?

17:02.936 --> 17:05.292
Oh, yeah.

17:05.374 --> 17:07.817
Looks like I'm missing out on that?

17:24.257 --> 17:26.068
You got a key?

17:30.964 --> 17:33.388
You're in fucking deep now, man.

17:33.968 --> 17:35.824
You're fucking deep.

17:35.904 --> 17:39.360
Oh, you're gonna fucking rot for that.

17:39.440 --> 17:40.917
You're...

17:44.778 --> 17:47.822
Fucking faggot.

18:12.105 --> 18:14.964
Out of your jurisdiction, ain't you, Johnson?

18:16.044 --> 18:18.700
I got the call. I figured
I'd come out and give your hand.

18:18.780 --> 18:21.169
Besides, I might have a related case.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.973
- Right. Right.
- That going to be a problem, Wayne?

18:25.653 --> 18:28.111
I guess we can work on this one together.

18:28.790 --> 18:33.912
Tell me something, Russ, the fellow
that Lawny was chatting up...

18:40.029 --> 18:42.311
...I wonder if you'd describe him to me.

18:45.205 --> 18:47.250
Strong, silent type.

18:48.209 --> 18:50.251
Great head of hair.

18:51.546 --> 18:53.402
Blue eyes.

18:54.232 --> 18:56.204
About six feet tall.

18:56.984 --> 18:59.211
He wore a really bad...

18:59.938 --> 19:02.058
...cheap mix-match suit.

19:04.258 --> 19:06.287
And he were a polka dot tie.

19:08.397 --> 19:11.241
- Like this?
- Exactly.

19:13.534 --> 19:17.018
Tell you what, Russ...

19:18.312 --> 19:22.463
...if he should come back,
if you should think anything...

19:22.543 --> 19:24.389
...call me.

20:41.188 --> 20:43.673
Don't fucking move.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.870
We're closed.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.950
Goddamn it.

21:22.730 --> 21:25.608
I said we're fucking closed, asshole.

21:29.570 --> 21:32.049
What the fuck are you doing, man?

21:35.142 --> 21:37.420
Jesus Christ.

21:42.683 --> 21:45.039
What are you, the big, bad wolf?

21:45.119 --> 21:48.610
I'm little red riding hood?
Is this a sex fetish thing?

21:49.490 --> 21:51.588
You want some boy pussy?

21:58.633 --> 22:00.509
So what?

22:06.773 --> 22:09.072
Who the fuck is Ivan Rawlings?

22:11.778 --> 22:14.169
Will Tucker put you up to this?

22:16.684 --> 22:19.182
You know you look like a goddamn idiot.

22:24.825 --> 22:26.690
Motherfucker.

22:28.362 --> 22:31.459
Why you cocksucker fuck head.

22:31.539 --> 22:33.997
Fuck you! Fuck you!

22:36.904 --> 22:39.768
The fuck is wrong with you?

22:40.908 --> 22:42.797
Jesus Christ!

22:42.877 --> 22:45.400
You little fucking cocksucker.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.378
You little fuck.

22:49.983 --> 22:53.008
You're going to have to do
better than this, young man.

22:53.087 --> 22:55.577
I ain't no faggot little pussy.

23:01.028 --> 23:04.430
Because he is my father...

23:04.609 --> 23:06.792
...and a pile of shit.

23:07.970 --> 23:10.124
Shit, I know you!

23:10.204 --> 23:14.671
Goddamn it, you're Asher.
You're the little fucking retard!

23:19.613 --> 23:23.847
Jesus! I think your old man
put down the wrong dog.

23:25.919 --> 23:28.607
You're still a fucking retard.

23:29.258 --> 23:30.778
Retard!

23:30.858 --> 23:34.698
Look at me! Look at me!

23:37.031 --> 23:40.822
Hey! Read my lips.

23:40.902 --> 23:44.912
Go fuck yourself.

23:47.643 --> 23:49.197
Okay.

23:49.278 --> 23:51.799
Okay. I'll tell you.

23:51.879 --> 23:54.736
He just got out. He's in Mexico.

23:54.816 --> 23:56.647
He's in Mexico.

24:02.246 --> 24:04.321
You little motherfucker!

24:09.261 --> 24:11.052
Okay. Okay.

24:11.133 --> 24:14.356
He got in some scrap
with some cop the other night...

24:14.435 --> 24:18.426
...and he wanted to lay low before
he came back to the clubhouse.

24:18.506 --> 24:20.529
We're going to throw him a party.

24:20.608 --> 24:24.432
He didn't show. Okay? He didn't show!

24:24.512 --> 24:28.436
I don't know. I know. I know. He's staying
in the Gator Stray Motel or some shit.

24:28.516 --> 24:31.939
All right! Don't shot me in the nuts.
God, don't shoot me in the nuts.

24:32.019 --> 24:34.083
Don't shot me in the nuts.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.734
You gotta untie me!

24:44.832 --> 24:46.463
I'm gonna die here!

24:56.676 --> 25:00.072
<i>My brother taught me all there is to know...</i>

25:04.215 --> 25:06.608
<i>...not just in his actions...</i>

25:06.688 --> 25:09.378
<i>...but also in his failures.</i>

25:10.459 --> 25:15.115
<i>Showed me that the Earth,
the moon, and the stars...</i>

25:15.195 --> 25:18.562
<i>...holds everything we need
to sustain ourselves.</i>

25:20.934 --> 25:24.724
<i>Taught me that nature
can be just as violent as man...</i>

25:25.890 --> 25:27.787
<i>...if not more.</i>

25:28.377 --> 25:31.041
<i>He was destined to be more.</i>

25:34.414 --> 25:36.438
<i>I want to go home.</i>

25:37.119 --> 25:38.941
I need you.

25:39.721 --> 25:41.343
Okay?

25:41.422 --> 25:44.046
I can't do this without you.

25:59.705 --> 26:02.772
<i>You don't want to be a boy forever,
now do you?</i>

26:29.102 --> 26:31.660
Welcome to the Gator Stray Motel.

26:31.739 --> 26:33.770
How can I help you?

26:36.810 --> 26:38.667
Rawlings.

26:38.746 --> 26:41.003
Mr. Rawlings.

26:41.883 --> 26:44.714
Nope. Nobody here by that name.

26:47.888 --> 26:50.077
Mr. Clark, nice to see you again.

26:50.157 --> 26:53.548
And you. I left my key in the room.

26:53.629 --> 26:56.417
Just a moment. Not a problem.

26:56.497 --> 26:58.395
Thank you.

27:09.476 --> 27:11.338
You dropped this.

27:11.418 --> 27:13.677
Now, you two have a good night.

27:15.581 --> 27:17.439
Oh, yeah.

27:19.686 --> 27:23.922
Sir, is there another name
you would like me to check, sir?

27:31.598 --> 27:34.463
<i>The world is crooked.</i>

27:37.103 --> 27:40.603
<i>Fathers have always taught their sons...</i>

27:40.682 --> 27:42.758
<i>...to replace them.</i>

27:43.845 --> 27:47.175
<i>Taught them how to use their hands...</i>

27:47.255 --> 27:49.118
<i>...and their feet.</i>

27:52.986 --> 27:56.388
<i>Taught them how to use
their knives and their guns.</i>

28:01.329 --> 28:06.606
<i>And soon the sons slayed great beasts...</i>

28:07.835 --> 28:11.238
<i>...giant lions lay dead.</i>

28:15.409 --> 28:18.307
<i>Then the aggressive alligators.</i>

28:20.947 --> 28:24.246
<i>Then the massive and mindless bulls.</i>

28:26.586 --> 28:31.998
<i>Finally, when there is nothing
left larger than the father...</i>

28:33.361 --> 28:36.183
<i>...the fathers became the prey.</i>

28:36.263 --> 28:39.154
<i>And the fathers were proud.</i>

28:40.934 --> 28:44.358
Oh, my God! Jesus, please.

28:44.438 --> 28:47.628
Oh, Jesus, please don't hurt me. No.

28:47.708 --> 28:51.341
Help! Help!

31:24.831 --> 31:26.969
What are you going to do with me?

31:27.048 --> 31:30.857
You're going to kill me too, aren't you?
I won't say anything.

31:39.812 --> 31:41.556
You're not?

31:42.136 --> 31:46.406
Of course, you're not because you're
a good man. You're a decent man.

31:46.486 --> 31:48.576
I knew it the moment I...

32:00.399 --> 32:04.292
I swear to God I won't tell
a damn soul. You can trust me.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.853
Please. Please.

32:16.348 --> 32:18.314
Yes, I understand.

33:55.115 --> 33:56.937
Asher.

33:57.617 --> 34:00.007
- A.
- God.

34:01.087 --> 34:03.515
Asher, you can do this.

34:03.694 --> 34:05.754
<i>You can do this.</i>

34:08.994 --> 34:10.873
<i>Dear Nana...</i>

34:11.788 --> 34:15.607
<i>...last time you write to me
you said you missed me.</i>

34:17.337 --> 34:20.960
- <i>What if she doesn't like me?</i>
- <i>It don't matter if she likes you, man.</i>

34:21.042 --> 34:24.496
- <i>She loves me.</i>
- <i>I just want to let you know...</i>

34:24.976 --> 34:26.906
<i>...I miss you too.</i>

34:27.481 --> 34:32.290
<i>A lot has changed since Chester
died and father got locked up.</i>

34:33.420 --> 34:36.380
<i>My mama hasn't left her bed
in almost a school year...</i>

34:36.460 --> 34:41.748
<i>...so I'm taking it upon myself
to be the man of the house.</i>

35:29.308 --> 35:33.022
<i>Come on, bad boy, show me what you've got.</i>

35:35.568 --> 35:37.446
<i>Good boy.</i>

35:52.097 --> 35:55.389
I cleaned your clothes for you.
I hope you don't mind.

35:56.569 --> 35:59.802
I put some food on the table.
Want some coffee?

37:31.363 --> 37:33.362
Do you have your work?

37:37.002 --> 37:39.041
You're still living at your mother's?

37:44.977 --> 37:47.076
Why did you come here, Asher?

37:52.883 --> 37:56.010
[I killed him.]

37:56.088 --> 37:57.987
You killed who?

38:03.430 --> 38:05.486
They let him out?

38:06.466 --> 38:08.064
When?

38:09.396 --> 38:12.353
[A few days ago.]

38:17.743 --> 38:19.642
You okay?

38:21.530 --> 38:24.655
Did you get stabbed? Actually, you know what?

38:24.735 --> 38:26.832
I don't even want to know.

38:34.610 --> 38:36.688
Are you in trouble with the law?

38:40.116 --> 38:42.473
What you did was stupid.

38:42.553 --> 38:45.485
You could have got yourself killed,
you know that?

38:52.558 --> 38:54.475
[How are you?]

38:55.031 --> 38:57.321
Just trying to make ends meet.

38:57.601 --> 38:59.825
Hence, the free show you got.

39:00.504 --> 39:03.469
Safer than other things,
if you know what I mean.

39:16.081 --> 39:18.639
I got a little boy. He's 5 now.

39:20.023 --> 39:22.778
Got pregnant not long
after we stopped talking.

39:23.842 --> 39:25.731
[What is his name?]

39:27.128 --> 39:32.970
C-H-E-S-S.

39:39.654 --> 39:41.393
[His father?]

39:42.845 --> 39:46.670
Your clothes are probably dry.
They're hanging outside.

39:46.751 --> 39:50.273
I gotta go to my mother's and
pick him up and run a few errands.

39:50.353 --> 39:52.793
Nothing has moved since
the last time you were here.

39:52.873 --> 39:55.429
You start hurting,
there's some vicodin in the bathroom.

39:55.559 --> 39:58.624
Oh, and, Asher, please do not take them all.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.437
<i>Dear Nana...</i>

41:44.946 --> 41:48.154
<i>...maybe signing was just
meant to be for us...</i>

41:48.235 --> 41:50.528
<i>...our own secret language.</i>

41:51.207 --> 41:53.631
<i>I tried to speak the other day.</i>

41:54.210 --> 41:58.869
<i>But when Wayne and his friends heard
the noises that came out of my mouth...</i>

41:59.549 --> 42:01.567
<i>...they just made fun of me.</i>

42:05.353 --> 42:09.104
<i>I have decided that from here on out...</i>

42:09.922 --> 42:12.144
<i>...I will never speak again.</i>

42:12.728 --> 42:14.552
<i>Yours forever...</i>

42:15.294 --> 42:17.152
<i>...Asher Rawlings.</i>

42:28.444 --> 42:30.433
She's not seeing him anymore.

42:30.513 --> 42:33.603
I know. I know.

42:33.683 --> 42:37.368
And that's why I wanted
to make this special for you.

42:38.421 --> 42:40.501
I want you to feel safe.

42:41.491 --> 42:43.547
You feel safe, don't you?

42:44.227 --> 42:45.826
Yeah.

42:47.496 --> 42:49.395
I love you.

42:56.071 --> 42:59.538
- Oh, Jessy, it hurts.
- Oh, baby, it's all right.

43:02.985 --> 43:05.813
Jessy, it hurts.

43:06.282 --> 43:07.847
Stop.

43:09.252 --> 43:10.816
Jessy.

43:13.773 --> 43:16.038
- It hurts.
- I'm sorry.

43:20.796 --> 43:22.218
Stop.

43:22.298 --> 43:25.415
Oh, bitch. Shit, that's fucking good.

43:25.495 --> 43:27.127
Jessy, it hurts.

43:27.208 --> 43:29.858
Oh, fuck. I'm gonna come.

43:33.109 --> 43:38.139
Oh, baby. I sure had
a good time with that one.

43:44.853 --> 43:46.541
Lisa?

43:50.326 --> 43:52.854
Lisa? Fuck!

44:03.338 --> 44:06.363
Wait a minute. Slow down.

44:06.444 --> 44:08.732
Slow down before somebody gets hurt.

44:09.012 --> 44:10.633
Asher.

44:10.913 --> 44:13.636
- Chess, would you like some dessert.
- Oh, yeah.

44:13.717 --> 44:19.286
Okay. Then we have ice cream
or cookies and milk. Which one?

44:22.256 --> 44:24.676
- Both.
- Both. Of course.

44:24.756 --> 44:29.049
Stupid question.
Asher, would you like some dessert?

44:30.583 --> 44:33.439
Okay, baby, would you please
clear your plate...

44:33.520 --> 44:36.842
...and fetch yourself dessert
and get Asher some dessert too.

44:36.922 --> 44:38.820
Thank you.

44:42.232 --> 44:44.136
[He looks like you.]

44:45.264 --> 44:47.161
He likes you.

44:51.035 --> 44:52.933
Do you need any money?

44:57.509 --> 45:00.239
I care about you, Asher,
but I can't have you here.

45:00.656 --> 45:04.245
[I understand,
I've gotta leave tomorrow anyway.]

45:08.220 --> 45:10.019
Thank you.

45:18.029 --> 45:20.085
You're just giving it up.

45:30.642 --> 45:33.272
Did you see what he just said?

45:35.015 --> 45:37.136
What's it mean?

45:37.217 --> 45:41.442
Asher said he's really happy
he was able to meet you, baby.

45:43.672 --> 45:46.788
- Tell him thank you.
- Thank you.

46:02.468 --> 46:05.387
So I'm just going through this wine
like an animal. Next thing I know...

46:05.466 --> 46:09.032
...there's this little itty-bitty lady.
She said, would you like an Ambien, sir?

46:09.112 --> 46:11.671
I'm like, fuck, yeah, I'd like an Ambien.
What's it do?

46:11.751 --> 46:15.070
Anyway, so I walk back,
take my shirt off, right?

46:15.150 --> 46:16.619
Holy shit.

46:21.910 --> 46:24.367
Well, I'll be damned.

46:24.447 --> 46:27.554
Shit, man. What the fuck?

46:27.633 --> 46:29.890
I can't believe you're here right now.

46:31.221 --> 46:33.118
Give me a second.

46:35.190 --> 46:38.403
Shit. So what the fuck, man?

46:38.577 --> 46:41.901
First thing you do
when you get out is you kill a cop?

46:42.631 --> 46:44.520
You crazy fucker.

46:44.600 --> 46:46.822
Looks he tried to kill you, brother.

46:46.902 --> 46:48.726
What happened to you?

46:49.406 --> 46:51.326
What happened to your legs?

46:51.407 --> 46:54.631
I got them jammed under
the hydraulic system on the lift.

46:54.710 --> 46:58.576
You know my dumb ass.
I drink too much, smoke too much.

47:05.186 --> 47:08.070
What's going on, buddy. What you looking for?

47:14.279 --> 47:16.288
Really, what happened to you?

47:21.636 --> 47:23.898
I need the keys to the safe.

47:24.606 --> 47:27.397
It's a combination now.

47:27.476 --> 47:29.399
6-6-6.

47:29.979 --> 47:32.002
Had it made custom.

47:32.982 --> 47:34.800
What you needing?

47:37.635 --> 47:39.533
What's going on, Ivan?

47:45.059 --> 47:47.157
What happened to my room?

47:50.431 --> 47:53.523
I just moved my stuff in
after the first year.

47:54.303 --> 47:56.202
Shit, I didn't know.

47:58.773 --> 48:01.449
You weren't supposed to be coming back.

48:02.544 --> 48:06.835
I can move all my shit out.
I can do that right now, Ivan.

48:06.915 --> 48:08.732
Ain't no big deal.

48:10.052 --> 48:14.077
Shit man, I'll do that right now.
Get that shit out there.

48:14.556 --> 48:16.254
Come here.

48:24.335 --> 48:26.744
How long we've been friends now?

48:28.887 --> 48:32.144
I don't know. 30 years maybe.

48:32.224 --> 48:34.581
I'm sorry about your old lady, by the way.

48:34.660 --> 48:36.549
Thank you.

48:37.129 --> 48:38.953
You get the flowers?

48:40.082 --> 48:42.234
I did. Thank you.

48:47.555 --> 48:49.649
You know, Tank...

48:51.697 --> 48:53.788
...I know the fucker...

48:54.005 --> 48:58.096
...who fucked up your feet is the
same fucker who tangled with me.

49:00.368 --> 49:02.613
No, I'm not mad at you.

49:03.702 --> 49:05.943
But I need the name.

49:06.976 --> 49:09.474
I want to go kill this motherfucker.

49:12.830 --> 49:15.855
You know better than that.
I didn't say anything.

49:16.335 --> 49:19.659
I'd never say nothing
about shit to nobody. I swear.

49:19.939 --> 49:22.691
You know me better than that.
We got code. I didn't say shit.

49:22.771 --> 49:26.249
I swear to God. I swear. I swear.

49:27.629 --> 49:31.062
I know you told him where I was,
and that's okay.

49:38.072 --> 49:39.903
Am I right?

49:48.149 --> 49:51.174
I'm sorry, brother. I'm sorry.

49:52.755 --> 49:54.823
I'm fucking sorry.

49:56.026 --> 49:58.314
He shot my fucking toes off.

49:59.595 --> 50:01.892
He was going to shoot me in the balls.

50:02.564 --> 50:05.538
It's okay. It's okay.

50:06.168 --> 50:08.457
It's not your fault, my brother.

50:08.537 --> 50:10.755
The motherfucker made you a cripple...

50:10.835 --> 50:14.305
...but like I said, I need a name.

50:25.219 --> 50:30.113
And no one came into that room or left
that room except this young couple.

50:30.193 --> 50:32.048
Am I right?

50:32.828 --> 50:35.975
There was this guy who was in and out.

50:37.765 --> 50:41.094
- Forgot something also.
- What did he look like?

50:41.173 --> 50:44.793
He had a fuzzy-looking
animal hat and glasses.

50:45.473 --> 50:47.304
Did he say anything?

50:51.477 --> 50:52.901
- Detective.
- Yeah.

50:52.981 --> 50:56.368
The plates came back on the truck.
It's Officer Lawny.

50:59.353 --> 51:03.779
- We need to run an APB on that truck.
- Actually, sir, we found it.

51:04.460 --> 51:06.548
You said he forgot something.
What did he forget?

51:06.628 --> 51:08.526
Forgot this.

51:44.432 --> 51:47.958
Okay. Now it's time for you to go to bed.

51:49.438 --> 51:51.729
Why can't Asher hear?

51:53.008 --> 51:55.964
'Cause he was in an accident
when we were kids.

51:56.044 --> 51:58.868
How do you know the secret language?

51:59.448 --> 52:02.105
Because my daddy was deaf too, baby.

52:02.184 --> 52:05.174
I think it would be better for him
if he stayed here with us.

52:05.254 --> 52:07.076
Do you?

52:07.256 --> 52:09.279
And why is that?

52:09.858 --> 52:12.769
Because I think he needs people
who care about him.

52:13.028 --> 52:15.285
When did you get so smart?

52:15.864 --> 52:17.619
- I love you.
- I love you too.

52:17.699 --> 52:21.165
Okay. You go to bed. Don't get up.

52:34.113 --> 52:37.949
We're going to church tomorrow.
Would you like to join us?

52:38.974 --> 52:42.175
[You trying to see
if I'll burst into flames?]

52:42.256 --> 52:45.881
We go every Sunday. You don't have to come.

52:45.961 --> 52:48.625
I just thought you might
want to hang out with us.

52:53.401 --> 52:55.757
Well, you can't come looking like that.

52:55.838 --> 52:59.293
I think I might still have
some of his father's clothes.

52:59.373 --> 53:01.237
They should fit.

53:13.554 --> 53:15.569
Tell me about Rawlings.

53:16.859 --> 53:19.682
He killed his son in a drunken rage.

53:20.512 --> 53:23.381
Made the other one deaf
beating him in the head.

53:25.333 --> 53:27.894
This is a pre-historic motherfucker.

53:27.973 --> 53:30.642
<i>And the Lord has a plan for you too...</i>

53:31.376 --> 53:33.463
<i>...but you gotta ask.</i>

53:34.243 --> 53:37.472
<i>In Jesus' name, amen.</i>

53:41.282 --> 53:43.506
Now who here today...

53:43.586 --> 53:47.149
...needs to be touched by the spirit?

53:47.230 --> 53:51.047
Needs to be touched
by the hand of the temple?

53:51.127 --> 53:54.617
Needs... to be saved?

53:54.798 --> 53:56.621
What did you do?

53:58.401 --> 54:00.253
Fucking eat him?

54:04.056 --> 54:06.303
What happened to my beauty queen?

54:09.944 --> 54:11.968
Just let yourself go, Boo-Boo?

54:12.048 --> 54:16.473
<i>By the law of our heavenly father.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Come on up.</i>

54:16.555 --> 54:18.929
Come up, sir, and be saved.

54:19.539 --> 54:21.307
<i>Be saved.</i>

54:21.387 --> 54:24.962
- <i>Is it your legs, son?</i>
- <i>It is, Preacher.</i>

54:25.757 --> 54:28.698
Do you have faith in the temple
and in the all mighty?

54:28.778 --> 54:33.001
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I do. Yes, sir.
- Brother Steve, would you give us a hand?

54:36.155 --> 54:38.650
And by the power invested in me...

54:40.527 --> 54:42.877
...I command the sickness out...

54:43.127 --> 54:45.533
...and put in the breath of our Lord.

54:52.305 --> 54:54.527
Amen. Amen.

54:54.607 --> 54:57.230
Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.

54:57.310 --> 54:59.037
Oh, hallelujah.

55:07.720 --> 55:11.328
Let the sick and suffering perish
the way the world does today.

55:12.359 --> 55:16.102
<i>It's sick and backwards.
We cannot let the wicked run free.</i>

55:16.186 --> 55:19.620
<i>Because it was our father who said all men...</i>

55:20.800 --> 55:24.053
- Well, ain't that some shit.
- <i>Plucked the worlds clean.</i>

55:26.039 --> 55:28.058
And only...

55:28.137 --> 55:32.171
...those who repent...

55:34.255 --> 55:35.935
...are free.

55:39.852 --> 55:43.576
Lord, drive the devils out. Lord.

55:43.656 --> 55:45.908
My little brother...

55:46.526 --> 55:48.800
...wherever I go, you go.

55:48.894 --> 55:51.723
<i>And only those...</i>

55:52.103 --> 55:53.850
<i>...who repent...</i>

55:55.192 --> 55:57.197
<i>...are free.</i>

55:58.387 --> 56:01.681
And that's when I heard my God
speak to me, and he said...

56:01.761 --> 56:06.883
...you've got to help your daddy shine
before you can shine for yourself.

56:07.831 --> 56:10.173
God's got a plan.

56:10.252 --> 56:13.155
I'm just saying with everything
that's happened...

56:13.235 --> 56:16.492
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to be seen with him.

56:17.172 --> 56:19.062
He is a Rawlings after all.

56:19.141 --> 56:22.564
So what should I have done,
left him on my porch to die?

56:22.644 --> 56:25.134
- It doesn't seem very Christian.
- Oh, no. No.

56:25.215 --> 56:27.971
Heavens no. And don't be
putting words in my mouth...

56:28.050 --> 56:31.441
...and don't be thinking I'm not proud
of you for helping him out now.

56:31.520 --> 56:33.775
But you've done your part.

56:33.856 --> 56:35.745
It's up to him now.

56:36.325 --> 56:38.719
He's got no reason to be sticking around.

56:39.142 --> 56:40.816
I told him that.

56:40.896 --> 56:43.504
I just feel guilty.

56:44.900 --> 56:50.292
You're an independent woman, Nana,
raised a smart, healthy, young boy.

56:50.372 --> 56:53.196
You don't need to be raising a man child.

56:54.476 --> 56:59.249
Like proverb says,
not my circus, not my monkeys.

56:59.329 --> 57:02.171
Yeah. I guess you're right.

57:02.551 --> 57:07.176
He's leaving tomorrow anyway.
I told him my mother was coming to stay.

57:08.057 --> 57:10.265
White lie never hurt anybody.

57:10.746 --> 57:12.990
Just let me know if you need
anything, all right?

57:13.069 --> 57:15.752
- Okay. I will, Preacher.
- All right.

57:16.331 --> 57:18.029
Bye, Lori.

57:21.636 --> 57:24.793
- Bye, Chess.
- Say good-bye, Chess.

57:24.873 --> 57:26.671
Bye, Chess.

57:27.609 --> 57:29.507
Come here.

57:33.014 --> 57:34.913
Time for bed, Chessy.

58:32.907 --> 58:36.205
All right, everybody, sit down...

58:36.285 --> 58:38.945
...relax, and be quiet.

58:39.481 --> 58:42.541
It is time for my sermon.

58:46.686 --> 58:49.362
I walk through the fire.

58:50.491 --> 58:53.790
I walk through the flames.

59:01.602 --> 59:06.859
I'm sorry, sir, but services
don't start until tomorrow morning.

59:07.575 --> 59:10.807
- Where's the deaf guy and the nigger?
- Excuse me?

59:14.816 --> 59:17.306
Now, you take me to the preacher.

59:17.885 --> 59:19.704
<i>You like that?</i>

59:19.784 --> 59:22.044
<i>I know how you like it.</i>

59:22.123 --> 59:25.048
<i>I know how you like it, motherfucker.</i>

59:26.427 --> 59:28.258
<i>Let me see you.</i>

59:33.951 --> 59:37.185
Goddamn it, Lori, get the fuck out!

59:37.706 --> 59:40.203
You stupid fuck.

59:45.078 --> 59:49.425
I'm sorry, Preacher Michael!
The man made me tell. I'm sorry!

59:49.509 --> 59:52.372
I knew you were doing your sermon again.

59:52.453 --> 59:54.301
I'm sorry.

01:01:01.371 --> 01:01:03.437
You're really good, Asher.

01:01:06.943 --> 01:01:08.809
Watch the bad guy.

01:01:13.517 --> 01:01:15.679
Can we get an ice cream?

01:01:17.038 --> 01:01:19.994
My favorite is vanilla.
I also like strawberry.

01:01:20.074 --> 01:01:21.911
What's yours?

01:01:24.328 --> 01:01:26.582
Vanilla? What's your second?

01:01:28.232 --> 01:01:31.042
Vanilla? Mine too.

01:01:45.933 --> 01:01:47.781
Keep your arm up.

01:01:49.403 --> 01:01:51.251
Keep your arm up.

01:01:53.057 --> 01:01:54.846
Thank you.

01:01:54.927 --> 01:01:56.983
He was a monster.

01:01:58.113 --> 01:01:59.768
The Lord is my life and salvation...

01:01:59.848 --> 01:02:01.887
- I need to know...
- ...which I fear.

01:02:01.967 --> 01:02:03.755
Arm up.

01:02:03.836 --> 01:02:06.491
About the monster.

01:02:06.671 --> 01:02:09.115
Who lit the fire, Lori?

01:02:10.743 --> 01:02:13.433
One-eyed gator?

01:02:14.512 --> 01:02:17.069
Are we talking about
a one-eyed alligator here?

01:02:17.148 --> 01:02:21.029
A one-eyed alligator lit the fire.
Is that what you're saying?

01:02:21.953 --> 01:02:24.710
Did the one-eyed gator
want to hurt Pastor Michael?

01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:26.847
He wanted his son.

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:32.217
The one-eyed gator
wanted Pastor Michael's son.

01:02:32.297 --> 01:02:34.153
Hand up.

01:02:35.033 --> 01:02:36.755
No.

01:02:36.835 --> 01:02:39.458
He want to kill his own son.

01:02:39.838 --> 01:02:43.095
The man with the pretty girl
and the little boy.

01:02:43.174 --> 01:02:44.998
His son.

01:02:45.377 --> 01:02:47.874
The lowly, the path with the light.

01:02:49.947 --> 01:02:52.446
Through the dark.

01:03:00.924 --> 01:03:03.407
<i>You gotta want it. You gotta see it.</i>

01:04:01.251 --> 01:04:03.116
Where is he?

01:04:08.792 --> 01:04:13.118
He left. He went north,
said he was going to a friend's house.

01:04:13.198 --> 01:04:15.420
I swear to God he left a day ago.

01:04:15.501 --> 01:04:17.672
I'm sure if you could just go out...

01:04:34.552 --> 01:04:38.009
You... you motherfucker.

01:04:38.388 --> 01:04:40.106
No!

01:04:41.725 --> 01:04:43.081
I'm sorry.

01:04:43.162 --> 01:04:47.818
Are you sorry for fucking me
or fucking my son?

01:04:50.035 --> 01:04:51.856
No.

01:04:52.736 --> 01:04:55.789
<i>Asher and Mommy sitting in a tree</i>

01:04:55.869 --> 01:04:58.584
<i>K-I-S-S-I-N-G</i>

01:05:01.212 --> 01:05:04.235
<i>First comes love, then comes marriage</i>

01:05:04.315 --> 01:05:07.407
<i>Then comes the baby in the baby carriage</i>

01:05:09.086 --> 01:05:11.810
<i>That's not all, that's not all</i>

01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:14.954
<i>Baby's drinking alcohol</i>

01:05:45.088 --> 01:05:48.310
Get in the back! Get in the back.

01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:10.301
Chess, I want you to lay down
and stay there, baby. You understand me?

01:06:10.381 --> 01:06:13.771
I thought you said you killed him.
You fucking lied.

01:06:13.851 --> 01:06:16.541
- You said he was dead. You lied.
- Mommy!

01:06:16.621 --> 01:06:19.623
It's okay. It's okay, baby. Cover your ears.

01:06:25.629 --> 01:06:27.951
No, I ain't touching no gun.

01:06:36.073 --> 01:06:37.671
Shit.

01:06:43.846 --> 01:06:46.113
Give me that fucking gun.

01:06:56.025 --> 01:06:58.959
I'm out of bullets.
I'm out of bullets, Asher.

01:07:47.626 --> 01:07:50.518
This motherfucker, I'm gonna get his ass.

01:07:50.648 --> 01:07:52.570
Stay down, Chess!

01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:54.898
Stay down!

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.909
I can't hit him!

01:08:41.429 --> 01:08:43.252
He's bleeding.

01:08:43.834 --> 01:08:45.671
He's been shot.

01:08:46.437 --> 01:08:49.868
Asher, he's been shot!

01:09:04.087 --> 01:09:07.345
<i>I have dreamed so many times...</i>

01:09:07.425 --> 01:09:12.084
<i>...that I have burnt his name from my skin...</i>

01:09:12.162 --> 01:09:15.207
<i>...leaving me with open wounds...</i>

01:09:15.787 --> 01:09:17.880
<i>...and deeper scars.</i>

01:09:20.203 --> 01:09:22.676
<i>Here, I have no eyes...</i>

01:09:22.755 --> 01:09:25.420
<i>...but I have a tongue and ears.</i>

01:09:25.743 --> 01:09:28.506
<i>I hear my father's foot steps...</i>

01:09:28.587 --> 01:09:31.844
<i>...stomping through the corridors
of my brain...</i>

01:09:32.424 --> 01:09:34.633
<i>...eating at my walls.</i>

01:09:36.086 --> 01:09:39.727
<i>He does not know that I stand behind him.</i>

01:09:40.158 --> 01:09:43.983
<i>I pulled back his head and expose his throat.</i>

01:09:45.462 --> 01:09:47.682
<i>I cut it.</i>

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:52.930
<i>I weep as I drop his body to the floor.</i>

01:09:53.671 --> 01:09:56.361
<i>I cut off my father's hands.</i>

01:09:57.241 --> 01:09:59.731
<i>They seem bigger than I remember.</i>

01:10:00.651 --> 01:10:02.539
<i>I start a fire...</i>

01:10:03.125 --> 01:10:04.884
<i>...and cook them...</i>

01:10:05.564 --> 01:10:08.206
<i>...until they're black and charred.</i>

01:10:08.486 --> 01:10:10.672
<i>I kneel in the mud...</i>

01:10:10.752 --> 01:10:13.613
<i>...like I did once when I was a boy.</i>

01:10:14.392 --> 01:10:18.149
<i>I lift my father's hands towards my mouth...</i>

01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:22.121
<i>...licking his rough palms
until my tongue bleeds.</i>

01:10:23.301 --> 01:10:25.557
<i>Then I awake.</i>

01:10:25.938 --> 01:10:30.015
<i>I'm exhausted by this long lapse of time...</i>

01:10:30.094 --> 01:10:32.826
<i>...eager to go home.</i>

01:10:33.811 --> 01:10:37.635
They should have put that man down,
like a dog when they had the chance.

01:10:37.715 --> 01:10:40.171
I'm sorry. But Asher...

01:10:40.251 --> 01:10:43.157
Asher was trying to help.

01:10:43.237 --> 01:10:47.462
Ivan was released, and he came to our house.

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:51.232
I don't want to hear anymore.
I don't want to hear anymore.

01:10:51.312 --> 01:10:55.670
<i>That boy brought this trouble
to your porch, and now look.</i>

01:10:55.749 --> 01:10:57.906
<i>You don't think I know that?</i>

01:10:57.986 --> 01:11:01.476
But we both know it would have
only been a matter of time...

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:04.755
...before Ivan came sniffing around here.

01:11:08.961 --> 01:11:10.786
He's going to be okay.

01:11:12.115 --> 01:11:13.817
It's my fault.

01:11:15.153 --> 01:11:17.575
Don't blame yourself, child.

01:11:17.855 --> 01:11:20.112
There's no time for that.

01:11:20.792 --> 01:11:23.347
Get you some rest, baby.
You can sleep in my room.

01:11:23.428 --> 01:11:25.284
- I'll stay with him.
- I can't leave him.

01:11:25.363 --> 01:11:27.403
I'll be here.

01:11:27.765 --> 01:11:31.422
You don't want him to wake up
and find you like this.

01:11:31.502 --> 01:11:32.979
It ain't fair.

01:11:38.257 --> 01:11:41.335
Okay. Let me know when he wakes up.

01:12:35.898 --> 01:12:39.565
Jesus, Asher. You scared me.

01:12:43.006 --> 01:12:44.904
You hungry?

01:12:49.178 --> 01:12:50.776
Damn.

01:12:58.422 --> 01:13:00.645
Why did you stop writing me?

01:13:00.724 --> 01:13:02.755
Was it something I did?

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.939
[I didn't want us to get hurt.]

01:13:14.805 --> 01:13:17.542
Well, you certainly made up for lost time.

01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:22.343
You can sleep out here tonight.

01:13:23.614 --> 01:13:25.154
What?

01:13:25.583 --> 01:13:28.205
It's more comfortable
than the one at my place.

01:13:28.286 --> 01:13:30.183
Sit down.

01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.799
That's what I said.

01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:06.900
That's not the real reason
you stopped writing me, is it?

01:14:12.588 --> 01:14:17.002
[I was always Chester's
little brother to you.]

01:14:21.098 --> 01:14:26.524
[You used me in life...]

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:30.934
[...to get closer to him in death.]

01:15:06.917 --> 01:15:09.206
His one eye is big as that?

01:15:09.287 --> 01:15:10.984
Bigger.

01:15:12.607 --> 01:15:16.048
- Are you sure?
- I told you I seen him, didn't I?

01:15:16.627 --> 01:15:18.225
Yeah.

01:15:20.597 --> 01:15:23.322
Well, how come you didn't kill him
when you had the chance?

01:15:23.401 --> 01:15:25.464
The timing wasn't right.

01:15:27.170 --> 01:15:29.209
Kill a beast like that...

01:15:30.188 --> 01:15:32.421
...you gotta wait until he's asleep.

01:15:42.335 --> 01:15:44.785
Hey, where you going?

01:15:47.225 --> 01:15:50.291
I'm coming with you. Yes, I am.

01:15:55.232 --> 01:15:57.096
Give him some.

01:15:59.052 --> 01:16:01.635
Don't be a fucking asshole.

01:16:03.073 --> 01:16:07.932
Look, I want to do this as much
as you do, if not more.

01:16:08.012 --> 01:16:11.257
And I'm happy you didn't kill him
the first time...

01:16:11.337 --> 01:16:14.829
...because this time I want to watch him die.

01:17:29.261 --> 01:17:31.390
[Don't let me forget this.]

01:17:31.477 --> 01:17:33.308
What's in it?

01:17:33.412 --> 01:17:35.976
[I need you to wait.]

01:17:36.065 --> 01:17:38.523
I told you I'm coming in there with you.

01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:42.667
[Keep the car running.]

01:17:45.674 --> 01:17:47.545
Motherfucker.

01:18:48.839 --> 01:18:50.732
<i>My dear Nana...</i>

01:18:51.196 --> 01:18:54.138
<i>...there are no words that
can ever repair the damage...</i>

01:18:54.217 --> 01:18:56.720
<i>...I have brought upon you and your family.</i>

01:18:59.616 --> 01:19:03.444
<i>There is not much more I can do
to right these wrongs...</i>

01:19:03.524 --> 01:19:06.619
<i>...besides what I intend to do today.</i>

01:19:11.278 --> 01:19:13.598
<i>I want you to know...</i>

01:19:13.677 --> 01:19:18.213
<i>...that I have loved you
since the first day I saw you.</i>

01:19:20.803 --> 01:19:24.182
<i>The only thing I can give you
besides this truth...</i>

01:19:25.159 --> 01:19:27.223
<i>...is what's in this bag.</i>

01:19:41.557 --> 01:19:43.621
<i>Now, listen carefully.</i>

01:19:44.228 --> 01:19:47.451
<i>I do not see the sunset this fun day.</i>

01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:49.354
<i>Promise me...</i>

01:19:49.435 --> 01:19:51.904
<i>...that you will send my body home...</i>

01:19:51.986 --> 01:19:54.625
<i>...to the mouth of the Mississippi.</i>

01:19:54.906 --> 01:19:56.193
<i>Asher.</i>

01:19:56.274 --> 01:19:58.505
Fuck you. I know you.

01:20:11.202 --> 01:20:13.815
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

01:20:13.895 --> 01:20:16.402
Take this, fucking retard!

01:21:45.313 --> 01:21:48.138
I love you.

01:22:03.415 --> 01:22:05.374
You fucking retard.

01:22:08.037 --> 01:22:09.959
Motherfucker.

01:22:10.039 --> 01:22:13.530
Hey, Asher, come on. Get up! Get up!

01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:15.609
Come on. Let's go.

01:22:24.954 --> 01:22:27.350
Let's go. Go. Go.

01:23:22.245 --> 01:23:26.086
Come on! Make me proud!

01:23:58.281 --> 01:24:00.979
Come on, motherfucker!

01:24:43.559 --> 01:24:45.615
<i>The world is not round.</i>

01:24:46.595 --> 01:24:48.816
<i>Not from where I stand.</i>

01:24:57.006 --> 01:24:58.815
<i>It is warped...</i>

01:25:00.643 --> 01:25:02.109
<i>...contorted...</i>

01:25:05.119 --> 01:25:06.940
<i>...crooked.</i>

01:25:07.717 --> 01:25:09.821
<i>Now, I know...</i>

01:25:10.394 --> 01:25:13.268
<i>...revenge is not a noble sentiment.</i>

01:25:14.849 --> 01:25:16.913
<i>But God knows...</i>

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:20.471
<i>...it is a human one.</i>

01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:30.775
<i>So take me home, my brother.</i>

01:25:32.592 --> 01:25:34.415
<i>Take me home.</i>

01:25:37.195 --> 01:25:39.061
<i>Take me home.</i>

01:25:40.305 --> 01:25:46.515
