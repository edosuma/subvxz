00:02.720 --> 00:04.599
Davros. My name is Davros.

00:04.680 --> 00:06.799
DOCTOR: Davros created
a new kind of warrior.

00:06.880 --> 00:08.439
Davros made the Daleks.

00:08.520 --> 00:09.959
But who made Davros?

00:10.280 --> 00:11.799
DAVROS: You said you'd help me!

00:11.880 --> 00:13.719
Shame. You're ashamed.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.119
COLONY SARFF: Davros is dying.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.959
He has a message for the Doctor.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.039
This is a trap!

00:18.160 --> 00:19.159
(HISSING)

00:19.240 --> 00:20.239
You brought me to Skaro!

00:20.320 --> 00:21.799
MISSY: This is the planet of the Daleks.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.799
Clara!

00:25.880 --> 00:28.199
You cannot help her now, Doctor.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.639
Compassion is wrong.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.679
(ROPE CREAKING)

00:43.880 --> 00:45.239
Consider the Doctor.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.079
The Doctor, trapped. The Doctor, alone.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.759
-You all right there, dear?
-Where are we?

00:53.200 --> 00:56.679
-How did we...
-MISSY: Shh, now, Mummy's talking.

00:56.760 --> 00:59.679
OK, I'm going to tell you
a story of the Doctor.

01:00.840 --> 01:01.839
It's classic.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.039
On the run, no Tardis.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.719
No friends, no help.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.319
In other words, the Doctor happy.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.719
It was a long time ago.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.439
Doesn't matter which
face he was wearing,

01:15.520 --> 01:17.039
they're all the Doctor to me.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.559
So let's give it to the eyebrows.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.119
But the Daleks?

01:21.200 --> 01:22.559
Yes, I'm coming to that.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.079
Shouldn't we be, um...

01:25.160 --> 01:27.839
-I don't want to say dead?
-Hush!

01:28.760 --> 01:30.999
-He's travelling by teleporter.
-(BEEPING)

01:31.080 --> 01:32.959
Unfortunately, his teleporter
is out of power.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.039
Also unfortunate, he's being stalked by,

01:35.120 --> 01:37.639
oh, say about 50 android assassins.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.959
I may be rounding up.

01:41.640 --> 01:42.639
Ow!

01:43.320 --> 01:46.599
Fifty invisible, indestructible
android assassins.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.119
All exclusively programmed to kill him.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.719
Why are you sharpening that stick?

01:50.800 --> 01:53.719
Well, I have no idea how long we're
going to be stuck out here,

01:54.360 --> 01:55.639
might have to go hunting.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.119
So why am I tied up?

01:58.560 --> 02:00.679
In case there is nothing to hunt.

02:00.760 --> 02:01.759
(CHUCKLES)

02:03.480 --> 02:05.519
The Doctor then, surrounded,

02:05.600 --> 02:07.639
outnumbered, outgunned.

02:07.720 --> 02:10.079
And freeze.

02:10.160 --> 02:13.919
Nanoseconds to live.
Four, I'd say, being generous.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.319
Now, my question is this,

02:16.360 --> 02:21.319
how did he survive?

02:21.400 --> 02:23.159
Oh, come on, Clara.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.479
You know him.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.039
Consider the Doctor.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.119
(CHUCKLES)

02:36.200 --> 02:37.439
(BEEPS)

02:37.520 --> 02:39.239
Where did he get that teleport thingy?

02:39.320 --> 02:41.959
Oh, good. Good!

02:42.040 --> 02:43.359
He stole one from an android.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.119
So, I'm guessing

02:45.200 --> 02:47.119
he uses the same energy
as the android weapons, right?

02:47.200 --> 02:48.519
Excellent!

02:49.840 --> 02:52.039
-Not seeing you as sandwiches now.
-OK then.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.319
He uses the energy wave
from the android weapons

02:54.400 --> 02:55.839
to recharge the teleport bracelet,

02:55.920 --> 02:58.119
and at the exact moment
he's supposed to disintegrate,

02:58.200 --> 03:00.199
he actually teleports.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.839
Hang on! That's how you did it.

03:03.440 --> 03:04.439
(SCREAMS)

03:05.120 --> 03:06.439
That's how we escaped the Daleks.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.519
I modified the same principles

03:08.600 --> 03:10.999
for our vortex manipulators, yes.

03:11.080 --> 03:13.279
Blew them off, I'm afraid.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.159
But the Doctor, he improvised it.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.799
He must have got through
several thousand calculations

03:17.880 --> 03:20.399
in the time it takes
to fire up a disintegrator.

03:20.480 --> 03:22.799
Seriously, what a swot!

03:22.880 --> 03:26.039
CLARA: So the androids think he's dead
and the Doctor escapes.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.599
MISSY: No, he's the Doctor.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.719
He fell into a nest of vampire monkeys.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.639
(MON KEYS SCREACHING)

03:35.720 --> 03:37.239
But that's another story.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.319
(GRUNTS)

03:41.160 --> 03:44.079
Why does the Doctor always survive?

03:44.840 --> 03:46.039
Because he's clever!

03:46.360 --> 03:47.679
Yes, but there's lots of
clever dead people.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.199
I love killing clever-clogs.
They make the best faces.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.919
Because he always assumes
he's gonna win.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.559
He always knows
there is a way to survive,

04:04.640 --> 04:05.999
he just has to go and find it.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.079
Yes, except this time, he made a will,

04:08.160 --> 04:09.799
and threw himself a goodbye party.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.799
Now, if the Doctor assumes
he is going to die,

04:11.880 --> 04:12.959
what happens then?

04:13.320 --> 04:14.799
We do.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.679
He's trapped at the heart
of the Dalek empire.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.159
He's a prisoner of the creatures

04:22.240 --> 04:23.519
who hate him most in the universe.

04:24.520 --> 04:25.999
Between us and him is everything

04:26.080 --> 04:28.559
the deadliest race in all
of history can throw at us.

04:28.760 --> 04:32.879
We, on the other hand,
have a pointy stick.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.439
How do we start?

04:37.280 --> 04:38.639
We assume we're gonna win.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.999
Oh, pity really.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.319
I was actually quite peckish.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.959
-Can I have a stick, too?
-Make your own stick.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.639
(TH EME MUSIC PLAYING)

05:30.160 --> 05:34.239
DAVROS: It took me so long
to realise it was you,

05:34.320 --> 05:37.519
standing at the gates of my beginning.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.199
And here you are at the end.

05:41.280 --> 05:45.519
But this time, I have you at my mercy.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.919
Exterminate!

05:48.760 --> 05:50.239

Ancient, inoperable.

05:56.000 --> 05:56.999
(GUN POWERS UP)

Genius.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.679
You would threaten a dying man?

06:02.760 --> 06:03.999
Have I not suffered enough?

06:04.080 --> 06:06.519
Get out.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.439
I cannot leave this chamber.
It sustains me.

How much of a drop
would you say that is?

08:04.920 --> 08:06.799
It's too dark. Um...

08:25.280 --> 08:27.399
where did I get the cup of tea?

having his chair.

The Doctor does not use weapons.

down here on your own.

gonna take my stick,

of actually killing me.

Bit of a mess, isn't it?

09:58.560 --> 09:59.559
Well, you said it was a sewer.

10:00.240 --> 10:04.079
The Daleks don't generate
much in the way of waste.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.399
So what is it all, then?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.479

Daleks can't die.

rots, liquefies.

10:24.440 --> 10:28.039
Interestingly, the Dalek word for sewer

is the same as their word...

and I haven't even
got out of my chair.

I want Clara Oswald.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.559
Safe, alive,

11:05.200 --> 11:08.479
and returned to me immediately.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.879
You bring her back! You do that!

11:13.440 --> 11:15.119
You do that now!

11:15.360 --> 11:16.999
Unharmed.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.799
Unhurt. Alive.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.159
SUPREME DALEK: Yourassociate...

11:22.240 --> 11:24.239
I saw what happened. I was there.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.799
And I am hoping, for all of our sakes,
that it was trick.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.239
SUPREME DALEK: It was not a deception.

11:29.320 --> 11:33.279
Because if Clara Oswald is really dead,

11:33.360 --> 11:37.599
then you better be very,
very careful how you tell me.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.439
Listen to that.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.759
The Doctor without hope.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.199

11:43.280 --> 11:44.799
Who's gonna go first?

11:45.600 --> 11:46.639
Nobody is safe now.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.919
DOCTOR: All the power
Davros had is mine.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.239
Everything he had, I have.

11:52.680 --> 11:57.119
Who is going to tell me
Clara Oswald is really dead?

11:57.200 --> 11:59.599
He'll burn everything. Us, too.

11:59.680 --> 12:03.319
SUPREME DALEK:
Clara Oswald is not alive.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.959
DAVROS: Doctor,
this urge for conquest...

12:10.040 --> 12:13.359
It is gratifying to see you learn.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.879
Davros! You're up.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.399
Sorry, this seat's taken.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.439
Indeed. Oh, but not by you.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.399
-(SNAKES HISSING)
-(SHUDDERING)

12:22.480 --> 12:28.079
You've met my head
of personal security, I think.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.359
Colony Sarff.

12:30.440 --> 12:33.039
-His agents are everywhere.
-(GRUNTS)

12:35.920 --> 12:39.039
DAVROS: Are you ready?
COLONY SARFF: Of course.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.799
Be subtle, Colony Sarff.

12:42.880 --> 12:47.039
Tonight we entrap the Time Lord.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.319
What is that? A lift?

12:54.400 --> 12:57.279
What? Never mind the lift.
See that thing on the wall?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.319
-What about it?
-Take a look.

12:59.440 --> 13:02.759
-What is it?
-Closer.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.439
-What am I even looking for?
-Nothing.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.799
I'm giving it a good look at you.

13:07.880 --> 13:10.279
DALEK: Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

13:10.360 --> 13:12.439
-Intruder alert!
CLARA: Why the hell did you do that?

13:12.520 --> 13:15.919
-Ever ring a doorbell and run away?
- Humanoid detected in lower level!

13:16.000 --> 13:17.319
But not this time.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.159
Daleks to lower level 1 3.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.559
What the hell did you do that for?

13:20.640 --> 13:22.719
We need to trap and kill a Dalek.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.879
You are the bait, I am the hook.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.559
Dark star alloy,

13:28.640 --> 13:31.919
goes through armour plating
like a knife through people.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.279
Missy. Missy.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.119
Missy, uncuff me now!

13:35.200 --> 13:36.719
It's pretty, though, isn't it?

13:36.800 --> 13:39.559
Got it in the olden days of Gallifrey,

13:39.640 --> 13:41.479
and the Doctor gave it to me
when my daughter...

13:41.560 --> 13:42.639
(LIFT OPENING)

13:42.720 --> 13:45.239
Keep it talking. We need
to draw it out of the lift.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.439
You can't kill a Dalek with a brooch.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.519
Yes, you can.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.519
DALEK: Humanoid detected.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.279
Remain still. Do not move.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.519
Scan in progress.

13:57.600 --> 14:02.799
Humanoid unauthorised
in restricted area.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.599
Sterilisation proceeding.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.039
MISSY: Hey, you!

14:08.800 --> 14:11.519
Guess what? I just put a hole in you.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.959
And another. And another. And another.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.679
What are you doing?

14:17.760 --> 14:19.999
Murdering a Dalek.
I'm a Time Lady. It's our golf.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.599
DALEK: Damage levels insignificant.

14:22.680 --> 14:23.679
MISSY: Oh, really?

14:23.760 --> 14:25.239
I think you're forgetting
you're surrounded

14:25.320 --> 14:27.679
by a bunch of very old,
very angry Daleks.

14:27.760 --> 14:28.759
(DECAYING DALEKS SQUEALING)

14:28.840 --> 14:32.239
MISSY: (IN US ACCENT) You just got
a puncture in a bad neighbourhood.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.199
Meet the locals,
all blind and squelchy,

14:34.280 --> 14:37.279
and out of their tiny minds,
but they can still smell!

14:37.360 --> 14:39.239
Nobody hates like a Dalek.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.519
Here they come!

14:40.600 --> 14:43.639
I think they want to steal your motor.

14:43.720 --> 14:47.679
DALEK: (GURGLING) Emergency! Emergency!

14:47.760 --> 14:51.039
My vision is impaired!
Exterminate! Exterminate!

14:51.120 --> 14:53.319
MISSY: Oh, here comes
the older generation.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.159
Oh, young folks today are so tetchy!

14:58.960 --> 15:02.199
Emergency! Emergency!

15:02.720 --> 15:04.199
(EXPLOSION)

15:07.800 --> 15:09.279
YOUNG DAVROS: Help me.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.399
You can't leave me.
You promised. You did!

15:15.840 --> 15:20.599
You said I could survive,
you said you'd help me!

15:20.680 --> 15:21.999
Help me!

15:24.440 --> 15:26.679
(BEEPING)

15:31.520 --> 15:34.439
DAVROS: I hope you are grateful.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.879
It wasn't easy to procure.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.639
And very nearly unique, of course.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.759
You should feel privileged.

15:44.720 --> 15:50.759
The only other chair on Skaro.

15:50.840 --> 15:54.119
-Don't get up.
-You neither.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.599
The chamber is sealed,

15:55.680 --> 15:59.679
and I believe you are not
carrying your sonic device.

15:59.760 --> 16:03.159
Gave it up. Bad memories.

16:04.120 --> 16:07.199
I am dying, Doctor.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.599
DOCTOR: You keep saying that.
You keep not dying.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.199
Can you give it some welly?
Come on!

16:12.280 --> 16:14.239
And it is time for us to conclude

16:14.320 --> 16:16.679
our business together.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.239
We have no business.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.799
DAVROS: We have nothing but.

16:21.240 --> 16:25.119
Look again at the cables, Doctor.

16:26.200 --> 16:30.079
Understand what they are.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.479
What they can do.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.039
Just step a little closer.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.399
(SNIFFING)

16:57.080 --> 16:58.079
Get in.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.119
They don't have much
respect for you, do they,

17:05.440 --> 17:06.799
your kids?

17:06.880 --> 17:09.319
Have you seen the state of this place?

17:09.400 --> 17:12.039
I mean, this is exactly where you'd dump

17:12.120 --> 17:14.119
a smelly old uncle,

17:14.200 --> 17:18.799
slash family pet,
slash genius scientist

17:18.880 --> 17:20.479
who couldn't even invent legs.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.519
Seriously, how do your boys take it

17:22.600 --> 17:24.519
when everybody else has got two eyes?

17:24.640 --> 17:26.679
You know what it is, of course.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.679
Oh, yes, it's a hyperspace relay

17:29.760 --> 17:32.039
with some kind of a genetic component.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.399
I am connected to the life force

17:34.480 --> 17:37.319
of every Dalek on this planet.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.199
It is what has kept me alive.

17:39.280 --> 17:43.879
As their hearts beat, so does mine.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.999
Ooh!

17:47.440 --> 17:48.759
Nice!

17:48.840 --> 17:51.119
Vampiring off your own creations,

17:51.200 --> 17:52.639
just to eke out your days.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.839
I'm surprised that the Daleks allow it.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.919
Oh, they have no choice.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.599
My Daleks are afflicted
with a genetic defect.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.599
What defect?

18:02.680 --> 18:04.279
Respect.

18:05.320 --> 18:08.439
Mercy for their father.

18:08.640 --> 18:14.679
Design flaws I was unable to eliminate.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.279
And now he sees it.

18:19.160 --> 18:23.919
Now he understands.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.279
The cables, Doctor, touch them.

18:27.360 --> 18:31.359
Imagine, to hold in your hand

18:31.440 --> 18:36.079
the heartbeat of every Dalek on Skaro.

18:37.120 --> 18:40.199
They send me life.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.559
Is it beyond the wit of a Time Lord

18:42.640 --> 18:45.879
to send them death?

18:45.960 --> 18:50.319
A little work, and it could be done.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.519
Now, why would you be telling me this?

18:52.600 --> 18:55.999
Genocide in a moment.

18:58.640 --> 19:02.879
Such slaughter, not in self-defence,

19:02.960 --> 19:05.879
not as a simple act of war,

19:05.960 --> 19:08.359
genocide as a choice.

19:09.320 --> 19:12.399
Are you ready, Doctor?

19:12.480 --> 19:17.359
So many backs with a single knife.

(DOCTOR SHUDDERING)

19:21.520 --> 19:26.239

19:41.240 --> 19:43.999
Why do you hesitate?

19:44.080 --> 19:47.039
No one would know.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.119
Clara Oswald is dead.

19:54.160 --> 19:58.159
Is this the conscience of
the Doctor or his shame?

19:58.240 --> 20:00.519
The shame that brought you here.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.199
There's no such thing as the Doctor.

20:03.280 --> 20:07.999
I'm just a bloke in a box,
telling stories.

20:08.080 --> 20:10.159
And I didn't come here
because I'm ashamed.

20:10.240 --> 20:13.039
A bit of shame never hurt anyone.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.239
I came...

20:20.200 --> 20:22.319
..because you're sick and you asked.

20:24.600 --> 20:29.719
And because sometimes, on a good day,

20:29.800 --> 20:33.319
if I try very hard,

20:35.160 --> 20:37.559
I'm not some old Time Lord who ran away.

20:41.560 --> 20:43.839
I'm the Doctor.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.039
Compassion, then.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.239
Always.

20:51.320 --> 20:54.639
It grows strong and fierce in you,

20:54.720 --> 20:56.839
like a cancer.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.079
I hope so.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.999
It will kill you in the end.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.799
I wouldn't die of anything else.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.679
You may rely on it.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

21:12.200 --> 21:13.199
(BEEPING)

21:14.080 --> 21:15.919
How am I supposed to
make it go without pedals?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.719
Telepathic control. Open wide.

21:19.360 --> 21:22.159
I meant your skull. Never mind.

-Ow!

21:23.840 --> 21:25.319
-Shh. Now, don't worry.
-Ow!

21:25.880 --> 21:29.359
There's loads of nanotech repairing any
damage as the feed goes in.

21:29.440 --> 21:32.319
-What about when it comes out?
-I've no idea. Nobody knows.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.799
Anyway, to control the unit
you just have to think.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.959
A novel idea for you, but let's try it.

21:38.840 --> 21:39.839
Move forwards.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.799
I don't know how to... (GASPS)

21:43.880 --> 21:45.559
-You see?
-Huh!

21:45.640 --> 21:46.679
How did I do that?

21:47.040 --> 21:48.559
-Circle right.
-I can't.

Don't, don't, don't, please!

22:04.960 --> 22:05.959
You OK?

22:06.800 --> 22:07.959
Fine, I think.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.519
(DALEK VOICE) Fine, I think.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.439
-OK.
-(DALEK VOICE) OK.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.279
That's a bit weird.

-Clara Oswald.
-Dalek. Dalek.

22:38.360 --> 22:39.359
MISSY: Just...

22:40.600 --> 22:42.719
Just don't get emotional.
Emotion fires the gun.

22:42.800 --> 22:43.799
OK?

22:44.040 --> 22:46.839
-I don't understand.
-(DALEKVOICE) I do not understand.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.079
Say...

22:49.560 --> 22:51.719
"I love you."

22:52.160 --> 22:54.879
Those exact words.
Don't ask me why, just say it.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.679
I love you.

-Exterminate.

-Exterminate! Exterminate!

23:25.320 --> 23:27.079
Exterminate!

23:28.760 --> 23:30.079
Cybermen supress emotion.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.679
Daleks channel it through a gun.

23:32.760 --> 23:34.159
That's why they keep
yelling "Exterminate,"

23:34.240 --> 23:36.119
it's how they reload.

23:38.640 --> 23:41.839
So let's go and kill them. Come on.

23:42.960 --> 23:46.199
There is a question, Doctor,
one I have longed to ask.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.359
Yeah, well, if you're gonna put your
hand on my knee, it isn't gonna go well.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.399
Why did you leave Gallifrey?

23:52.480 --> 23:53.919
Well, because I did.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.279
You stole a Tardis and ran and ran.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.479
Why?

23:58.800 --> 24:01.519
It was a boring place, Gallifrey.
I was going out of my mind.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.519
Yet you long to return.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.239
Ah, well, I'm inconsistent.

24:05.320 --> 24:08.159
But it is always the same lie.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.399
-What lie?
-You weren't bored.

24:11.840 --> 24:15.719
No one runs the way you have
run for so a small reason.

24:16.600 --> 24:17.639
I do.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.479
No, you don't.

24:21.360 --> 24:26.399
Colony Sarff confiscated
these items on your arrival.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.919
A Time Lord confession dial, I believe.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.759
Your confession.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.599
Tell me.

24:35.840 --> 24:39.359
Send me to my grave
with this precious knowledge.

24:39.440 --> 24:43.039
What is the Doctor's confession?

24:43.120 --> 24:44.479
Don't you dare!

24:44.560 --> 24:47.599
Is it possible I have touched a nerve?

24:47.680 --> 24:50.759
Some things matter
to me, Davros. Not many, but a few.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.319
And you don't put your
fingers anywhere near them.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.079
And they better not be scratched.
These are my best ones.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.799
DAVROS: Still you play the fool.

25:00.880 --> 25:03.039
Well, by now,
that should make you nervous.

25:04.880 --> 25:05.959
DALEK 1 : Halt!

25:06.800 --> 25:07.799
Report!

25:10.200 --> 25:11.199
Humanoid intruder...

25:11.280 --> 25:14.079
(DARLEKVOICE) Humanoid intruder
found on lower levels.

25:14.760 --> 25:17.879
DARLEK 1: Why has the intruder
not been exterminated?

25:19.600 --> 25:20.759
Explain!

25:23.080 --> 25:25.119
Explain! Explain!

25:25.200 --> 25:27.879
I'm a prisoner of special significance.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.079
Count the hearts.

25:30.720 --> 25:31.999
You are a Time Lord.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.559
Time Lady, thank you.

25:34.640 --> 25:37.119
Some of us can afford the upgrade.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.999
Is it still the same old
Supreme Dalek these days?

25:40.800 --> 25:43.639
I fought him once on
the slopes of the netherworld.

25:44.040 --> 25:46.239
Tell him the bitch is back.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.719
DAVROS: Make your confession, Doctor.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.239
Why did you really leave Gallifrey?

25:52.040 --> 25:54.519
How long has it been, you and I?

25:54.960 --> 25:56.759
Long enough.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.159
Galaxies have burned.

25:59.240 --> 26:01.519
And now you ask me a personal question?

26:01.600 --> 26:05.239
You have slaughtered
billions of my children,

26:05.320 --> 26:09.159
as I have slaughtered
billions of your race.

26:09.240 --> 26:13.879
We have exhausted
the conventional means of communication.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.079
My people are alive.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.399
They didn't die.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.239
I brought them back. I found a way.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.799
Is this true?

26:23.200 --> 26:25.999
Gallifrey is back in the sky.

26:26.640 --> 26:29.159
I don't know where, I may never know.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.919
But Gallifrey is back and it is safe.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.559
From both of us.

26:37.720 --> 26:38.919
DAVROS: Doctor,

26:40.640 --> 26:44.159
my most sincere congratulations.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.519
(SCOFFS) I'm sorry?

26:48.160 --> 26:50.079
This is wonderful news.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.519
Beyond all hope.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.079
I congratulate you.

26:56.720 --> 26:57.759
Why are you saying that?

26:58.200 --> 27:00.959
A man should have a race,

27:01.040 --> 27:03.239
a people, an allegiance.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.479
A man should belong.

27:06.560 --> 27:10.519
Doctor, believe me, please...

27:12.240 --> 27:14.359
I am happy for you.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.399
So happy.

27:17.480 --> 27:19.719
I don't... I don't understand this.
Why are you...

27:30.320 --> 27:31.719
DAVROS: Come closer again.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.559
Let me see your face.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.239
You've seen it often enough.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.759
Let me see it again,

27:40.840 --> 27:42.759
with my own eyes.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.079
(BEEPING)

27:48.960 --> 27:50.799
(BREATHING H EAVILY)

28:09.200 --> 28:10.399
Closer.

28:10.800 --> 28:11.999
Please.

28:25.400 --> 28:29.679
If you have redeemed
the Time Lords from the fire,

28:31.880 --> 28:34.759
do not lose them again.

28:36.760 --> 28:40.719
Take the darkest path
into the deepest hell,

28:42.160 --> 28:45.359
but protect your own,

28:47.440 --> 28:49.319
as I have sought to protect mine.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.399
Did I do right, Doctor?

29:02.480 --> 29:03.719
Tell me.

29:05.960 --> 29:07.199
Was I right?

29:10.520 --> 29:12.919
I need to know,

29:13.000 --> 29:14.319
before the end,

29:16.960 --> 29:18.319
am I a good man?

29:20.120 --> 29:21.839
You really are dying, aren't you?

29:23.640 --> 29:24.639
(IN HALES DEEPLY)

29:24.960 --> 29:26.119
Look at me.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.279
Did you doubt it?

29:31.880 --> 29:32.959
Yes.

29:34.360 --> 29:37.639
Then we have established one thing only.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.319
What?

29:40.920 --> 29:45.919
You are not a good doctor.

29:50.440 --> 29:51.759

30:18.400 --> 30:19.399
Pity.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.599
I had hoped to see the sun

30:23.760 --> 30:25.719
one last time,

30:25.800 --> 30:28.239
with the eyes of my true self.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.519
Oh, hello! (SCOFFS)

30:37.640 --> 30:39.919
Look at you all,
with your nice shiny domes.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.879
Oh ! I am loving this.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.119
You're my secret favourite,
don't tell the others.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.959
SU PREME DARLEK: You are an enemy
of the Daleks.

30:49.040 --> 30:52.759
Yes, well anyone who's not a Dalek
is an enemy of the Daleks,

30:52.840 --> 30:55.239
so that was an easy guess.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.519
You will be exterminated.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.559
Please, please do because
I have been on my feet all day.

31:00.640 --> 31:04.039
But before you get all 'exterminatey',

31:04.120 --> 31:05.399
two things.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.879
One, I want to see Davros.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.959
Two, I have a lovely
little gift for you all,

31:11.040 --> 31:12.879
if you take me to him right now.

31:12.960 --> 31:15.519
We do not negotiate.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.559
Clara Oswald.

31:18.160 --> 31:22.599
I've brought you complete control
of the Doctor, gift-wrapped.

31:23.160 --> 31:24.359
Better!

31:25.040 --> 31:26.239
Canned.

31:29.720 --> 31:33.879
DAVROS: It is beautiful,
my world, is it not?

31:34.720 --> 31:35.959
DOCTOR: How did you get it back?

31:36.320 --> 31:38.919
The Daleks remade it.

31:39.800 --> 31:43.399
(CLEARING TH ROAT) Like you,
they have a strong concept of home.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.799
No, like you.

31:46.640 --> 31:49.439
Everything you are, they are.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.279
H mm, like both of us, perhaps.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.479
How far we have come to go home again.

32:02.960 --> 32:06.319
I'm trying to pep this up,
but you've been gone a long time.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.799
Every Dalek on Skaro
isn't enough any more.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.559
It is so good of you to help me.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.399
I'm not helping you.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.279
Here it comes.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.199
I wish,

32:38.640 --> 32:39.999
just once,

32:42.200 --> 32:44.159
we had been on the same side.

Don't ever tell anyone that I did this.

33:30.440 --> 33:33.799
A little bit of regeneration energy.

33:33.880 --> 33:36.639
Probably cost me an arm
