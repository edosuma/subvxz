03:44.759 --> 03:45.879
Thomas?

03:46.839 --> 03:49.679
A body part has been found
on a municipal dump

03:49.679 --> 03:52.439
and they want a couple of Home
Office pathologists on the scene.

03:52.439 --> 03:54.919
How do you feel about a trip
to Brighton?

04:09.680 --> 04:11.160
DI Neil Taramelli.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.480
Nikki Alexander?
Jack Hodgson.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.320
Dr Nikki Alexander's my
colleague. She's on her way.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.040
Oh, sorry. Crossed wires.
That's all right.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.399
He's not himself this morning.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.321
DS Hannah Quicke.
Hello.

04:21.321 --> 04:23.121
It's, um... It's over there.
Right.

04:23.121 --> 04:26.201
He's already coughed up his
breakfast. It's not funny.

04:26.201 --> 04:28.081
I'm meant to be investigating
this.

04:28.081 --> 04:30.961
How am I going to do that if I can't
even look at the evidence?

04:33.081 --> 04:35.401
The guy who found it thought
it was part of a painted dummy.

04:35.401 --> 04:36.681
Uh-huh.

04:36.681 --> 04:38.001
There. Thanks.

04:47.082 --> 04:49.002
Any more body parts been found?

04:49.002 --> 04:50.242
No. As soon as they found that,

04:50.242 --> 04:51.962
they called us and cordoned off this
area.

04:51.962 --> 04:55.082
According to the time sheets,
it was the first lorry of the day.

04:55.082 --> 04:56.362
Uh-huh.

04:56.362 --> 04:57.882
Where there's one body part...

04:57.882 --> 05:00.042
Oi! Get out of it!

05:09.443 --> 05:10.483
Ah!

05:14.603 --> 05:17.003
Yeah, that's a foot in a pizza bag.

05:17.003 --> 05:18.923
HE GAGS

05:18.923 --> 05:20.243
Here!

05:21.323 --> 05:23.603
I'd rather not.
If you're going to be sick...

05:24.723 --> 05:25.763
You OK, sir?

05:25.763 --> 05:27.243
Yes...

05:27.243 --> 05:30.003
How quickly can you raise a
DNA profile?

05:30.003 --> 05:32.724
We need to do the initial
examination here first.

05:32.724 --> 05:35.324
Once that's done, everything will be
sent to the Lyell.

05:35.324 --> 05:37.124
It's only about an hour away.

05:38.164 --> 05:39.284
Right.

05:39.284 --> 05:41.604
Now let's see if we can find
the rest of this body.

05:45.364 --> 05:47.444
WATER RUNS

06:26.286 --> 06:29.726
THOMAS: To Brighton, to Brighton,
where they do such things.

06:29.726 --> 06:31.806
CLARISSA: Poetry, Thomas?

06:33.246 --> 06:37.246
One of my first jobs was in
Brighton. A young man found
murdered under the pier.

06:38.726 --> 06:40.486
We never did catch his killer.

06:40.486 --> 06:42.086
Not a happy memory, then?

06:42.086 --> 06:45.487
Well, you know how you
always remember the failures.

06:45.487 --> 06:47.887
What time did you call Nikki?

06:47.887 --> 06:49.327
She not there yet?

06:49.327 --> 06:50.687
How did she sound?

06:50.687 --> 06:53.207
Quite pleased to be out of the
Lyell, if I'm honest. Why?

06:53.207 --> 06:55.407
She seems a little preoccupied.

06:55.407 --> 06:57.727
Long-distance relationships.

06:57.727 --> 07:00.127
Most relationships, if
you ask me.

07:02.007 --> 07:03.567
That's an irezumi.

07:03.567 --> 07:04.927
An ire what?

07:04.927 --> 07:07.128
I'll call you back.

07:16.088 --> 07:17.768
VOICEMAIL: Hello.
This is Mark Garcia.

07:17.768 --> 07:20.208
Please leave a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.

07:21.168 --> 07:22.488
Hi, it's me.

07:23.408 --> 07:25.688
I'm in Brighton, and it's lovely.

07:28.008 --> 07:29.768
I know you're an ocean away,

07:29.768 --> 07:34.249
but standing here by the sea
with the sun on my face...

07:36.209 --> 07:38.329
..just made me think of you.

07:39.689 --> 07:41.169
Call me.

07:43.409 --> 07:45.009
PHONE VIBRATES

07:45.969 --> 07:48.009
Clarissa?
Nikki.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.329
Where are you?

07:49.329 --> 07:50.569
Nearly there.

07:50.569 --> 07:51.849
Are you OK?

07:51.849 --> 07:55.090
I was going to ask you the same
thing. I'm fine.

07:55.090 --> 07:56.370
You should come down.

07:56.370 --> 07:59.850
I'd love to, but someone
needs to be here, hold the fort.

07:59.850 --> 08:01.330
What's the weather like?

08:01.330 --> 08:03.610
Terrible. Wind. Rain.

08:03.610 --> 08:06.370
You'd hate it.
So when it says 24 degrees

08:06.370 --> 08:08.250
with a light south-westerly...?

08:08.250 --> 08:10.410
I'll bring you back an ice cream.

08:17.090 --> 08:19.131
On first viewing, I would say

08:19.131 --> 08:22.251
these have been cut using a saw of
some kind.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.291
Would it need an electric saw?

08:24.291 --> 08:26.571
Not necessarily,
though that would be quicker.

08:26.571 --> 08:30.171
Dismembering a body by
hand is hard work, it takes
time, not to mention the mess.

08:31.771 --> 08:33.491
Look, can you see?

08:34.731 --> 08:38.611
It's not a clean cut - kerf marks at
the end suggest a hand saw.

08:40.691 --> 08:42.131
Oh...

08:42.131 --> 08:44.011
DI Taramelli.

08:44.011 --> 08:46.652
Dr Nikki Alexander?
Yeah. How are you doing?

08:46.652 --> 08:48.132
Been one of those mornings.

08:48.132 --> 08:50.652
I'm guessing you
people get special injections.

08:50.652 --> 08:52.812
For what?

08:52.812 --> 08:54.932
For working in a place like this.
God knows what you could catch.

08:54.932 --> 08:57.092
Bubonic plague, if you're lucky.

08:58.092 --> 09:01.132
We've got the right arm,
heavily tattooed,

09:01.132 --> 09:02.852
and a left foot.

09:02.852 --> 09:04.412
So far, anyway.

09:09.893 --> 09:11.733
HE WHISTLES

09:11.733 --> 09:13.493
Nikki!

09:24.453 --> 09:27.653
This smell gets right inside you.

09:27.653 --> 09:29.493
Maybe that's it, Detective.

09:29.493 --> 09:34.174
The smell, not the body parts,
making you feel sick.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.894
You must have seen worse.

09:35.894 --> 09:38.094
Bobby on the beat -
one of my first jobs

09:38.094 --> 09:40.654
was to wait inside a house
with a dead body.

09:40.654 --> 09:43.734
His face had been half eaten
off by his Jack Russell.

09:43.734 --> 09:47.174
Ohh! How long had he been
in there? Two weeks.

09:47.174 --> 09:50.134
So the smell must have...
I had to burn my uniform.

09:50.134 --> 09:52.974
I should have come to you
for my post-traumatic therapy.

09:52.974 --> 09:54.375
Should have.

10:06.455 --> 10:08.935
I wonder if the head has been put
somewhere else.

10:08.935 --> 10:11.055
What, to hide possible
identification?

10:11.055 --> 10:14.455
And the hands. Neither have been
found so far.

10:17.055 --> 10:19.176
Property News.

10:19.176 --> 10:21.576
You see those outside
every estate agent's.

10:21.576 --> 10:23.976
So unlikely to help us find
the scene of the crime.

10:23.976 --> 10:25.696
And there was me thinking
police work

10:25.696 --> 10:29.216
was going to add some glamour to my
life. Not done this long, then?

10:29.216 --> 10:32.496
This time three years ago,
I was teaching Year 11s

10:32.496 --> 10:36.296
quadratic equations and single
variable inequalities,

10:36.296 --> 10:41.617
but then... My husband calls it
the ultimate mid-life crisis.

10:43.697 --> 10:44.977
What's that?

11:02.057 --> 11:03.497
Thomas!

11:48.539 --> 11:50.019
Mick? >
Yeah.

11:51.139 --> 11:52.179
What?

11:52.179 --> 11:53.980
You're not going to work,
are you?

11:53.980 --> 11:56.340
You should be inside. I'm OK.

11:56.340 --> 11:59.300
You need to rest,
you lost a lot of blood.

12:00.820 --> 12:01.940
Hello, you.

12:03.540 --> 12:05.980
We need to decide on a name.

12:07.020 --> 12:09.740
What about Maud? Maud?

12:09.740 --> 12:11.500
You are kidding me?

12:15.420 --> 12:18.461
Carola, can you hear me? Carola?

12:19.421 --> 12:21.261
Her pulse rate has increased
slightly.

12:21.261 --> 12:22.461
Her temperature is down.

12:22.461 --> 12:24.941
Is her husband still here?
I don't think so.

12:24.941 --> 12:26.221
After you talked to him about

12:26.221 --> 12:29.661
the possibility of Carola
donating her organs... Yes, well...

12:50.222 --> 12:53.062
I'm waiting to speak to a colleague
who's more of an expert,

12:53.062 --> 12:56.222
but if these body parts
are from the same body,

12:56.222 --> 13:00.862
what you're looking at
is an irezumi body suit.

13:00.862 --> 13:02.902
Japanese?
Traditional tattooing -

13:02.902 --> 13:07.343
done by machine,
or by hand using a tebori.

13:07.343 --> 13:12.703
The needles at the end of the tebori
are jabbed into the skin,

13:12.703 --> 13:14.623
depositing the
different-coloured inks.

13:14.623 --> 13:16.863
It's a highly skilled art form.

13:16.863 --> 13:19.783
And painful, by the looks of it.
How long does it take?

13:19.783 --> 13:23.703
It depends on the size and the
intricacy of the design,

13:23.703 --> 13:26.623
but usually months,
years sometimes.

13:26.623 --> 13:29.784
Aren't they symbols of gangs
and criminals?

13:29.784 --> 13:32.984
Irezumi tattoos are associated
with yakuza,

13:32.984 --> 13:34.704
but not limited to them.

13:34.704 --> 13:36.544
Yakuza gangs in Brighton?

13:36.544 --> 13:38.264
That's all we need.

14:18.746 --> 14:20.746
BANGING ON DOOR

14:32.866 --> 14:35.666
MAN: Akito!
We know you're in there!

14:49.507 --> 14:51.467
CLARISSA: Heisuke, konban
wa.

14:51.467 --> 14:54.987
Yeah, Clarissa, mata kondo
mitte ga ureshi, yo.

14:54.987 --> 14:58.227
Watashi mo. Kochira wa watashi no
douryou...

14:58.227 --> 15:00.947
..Nikki, Thomas, and this is
Detective Inspector...

15:00.947 --> 15:03.908
..Taramelli. And Detective Sergeant
Quicke.

15:03.908 --> 15:06.868
Nice to meet you all.
Sorry to call you so late.

15:06.868 --> 15:10.188
That's fine. This is important -
these photos you sent me.

15:10.188 --> 15:12.828
I'll put up some of the more
recent ones we've found.

15:15.548 --> 15:19.188
This style of bodysuit
is called munewari.

15:19.188 --> 15:22.388
The man had this done in the
UK? We don't know.

15:22.388 --> 15:26.428
You might find he's come to Japan
and gone to an irezumi master.

15:26.428 --> 15:29.709
Or it could be a Japanese
man who's come to the UK.

15:29.709 --> 15:33.309
I wanted to ask you about the
meaning of the various images.

15:33.309 --> 15:36.149
It might help tell us something
about the man. Sure.

15:36.149 --> 15:41.069
On his shoulder is a koi, which
swims against a very heavy current,

15:41.069 --> 15:44.909
so this suggests the person has been
through very difficult times.

15:44.909 --> 15:46.829
And the...

15:46.829 --> 15:48.229
..lotus flower?

15:48.229 --> 15:51.510
It's an image tied to the
Buddhist faith.

15:51.510 --> 15:53.670
Spiritual awakening.

15:53.670 --> 15:56.430
The lotus starts at the bottom
of the pond

15:56.430 --> 15:58.510
and slowly makes its way to
the top.

15:58.510 --> 15:59.830
And what about this one?

16:01.110 --> 16:04.670
The namakubi -
death before dishonour.

16:04.670 --> 16:08.110
This man was not to be
messed with.

16:08.110 --> 16:11.470
TARAMELLI: Any idea who might have
done these tattoos?

16:11.470 --> 16:15.191
Oh, yes. Most irezumi artists
sign their name -

16:15.191 --> 16:17.671
the first part in Chinese kanji -

16:17.671 --> 16:19.911
"hori" meaning "carving",

16:19.911 --> 16:22.631
and the second part
in Japanese characters.

16:22.631 --> 16:25.191
Does that mean that whoever did
these tattoos

16:25.191 --> 16:26.751
might know who this man is?

16:26.751 --> 16:28.951
That would be possible,

16:28.951 --> 16:30.671
but the signature

16:30.671 --> 16:32.831
on this irezumi isn't complete.

16:32.831 --> 16:35.111
As a result of the
dismembering, I think.

16:35.111 --> 16:37.071
PHONE VIBRATES
Hello?

16:37.071 --> 16:40.672
Are there traditional irezumi
artists like this in the UK?

16:40.672 --> 16:45.512
I'm sure there are but, again,
this work looks quite exceptional.

16:46.952 --> 16:50.152
I can circulate the images
with the people I know.

16:50.152 --> 16:53.112
Also, I do have a database of known
yakuza designs

16:53.112 --> 16:55.272
that I can share with you, Clarissa.

16:55.272 --> 16:57.712
Heisuke, arigatou.

16:57.712 --> 17:00.432
Iie de. Clarissa no tame
datta nande wo suru, sa.

17:00.432 --> 17:02.153
Mata ne.

17:02.153 --> 17:03.473
Mata ne.

17:03.473 --> 17:05.913
Are there no limits to
this woman's talents?

17:05.913 --> 17:07.233
No,

17:07.233 --> 17:08.353
wa nai.

17:10.393 --> 17:12.193
Ah, apologies.

17:12.193 --> 17:13.433
That was the lab.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.433
DNA confirms all parts from
the same body

17:15.433 --> 17:17.233
but there's nothing on the
database to identify him.

17:17.233 --> 17:20.593
What about a familial search?
They're doing that now.

17:20.593 --> 17:23.673
So, no identifiable DNA,
but we do have the tattoos.

17:23.673 --> 17:26.473
Which we can show to the various
tattooists in Brighton...

17:26.473 --> 17:29.074
Well, not just Brighton. If this
is as specialist

17:29.074 --> 17:32.074
as your friend suggests,
we need to spread the net wide.

17:42.994 --> 17:44.354
What?

17:44.354 --> 17:46.514
You lied to me.

17:48.354 --> 17:50.795
I found this in your jacket pocket.

17:52.915 --> 17:55.315
You promised me...
It was the last time.

17:55.315 --> 17:57.355
It was a final blowout
before the baby came.

17:57.355 --> 17:59.675
How can you even afford this
when we can't even afford a
new cot for the baby?

17:59.675 --> 18:01.595
It's not my fault she came
early!

18:04.915 --> 18:06.355
That's all done now. Yeah?

18:06.355 --> 18:07.475
I swear...

18:08.715 --> 18:10.195
..on the baby's life.

18:14.716 --> 18:17.036
This is a new start, yeah?

18:18.436 --> 18:21.756
For me, you, the baby.

18:21.756 --> 18:23.436
We're a real family now.

18:27.036 --> 18:28.716
I'm sorry.

18:34.796 --> 18:36.516
What's this?

18:39.117 --> 18:40.757
I cut myself.

18:40.757 --> 18:42.517
My mum bought us this.

18:42.517 --> 18:45.117
You're going to have to be more
careful, Mick,

18:45.117 --> 18:46.797
especially around the baby.

18:57.797 --> 18:59.877
CLARISSA: Make sure we get
the far end.

19:02.398 --> 19:04.318
JACK: Brought your new toy
to Brighton, then?

19:04.318 --> 19:05.558
When will we see the results?

19:05.558 --> 19:07.878
Once I've combined
the scans at the Lyell,

19:07.878 --> 19:10.278
we should have a full 3D model.

19:10.278 --> 19:11.518
Uh-huh.

19:11.518 --> 19:15.158
Would you, uh, mind getting
out of shot?

19:15.158 --> 19:17.638
Have you identified
the dismembered man yet?

19:17.638 --> 19:20.758
Not yet, but they're working on it.
What about the bin lorry?

19:20.758 --> 19:22.238
What about the bin lorry?

19:22.238 --> 19:25.079
Well, we know it was the first
lorry back after the
early-morning round.

19:25.079 --> 19:26.919
Timed in at 07.42.

19:26.919 --> 19:29.439
We also know which route it took.

19:29.439 --> 19:32.519
So now all we have to do is
go through all the rubbish

19:32.519 --> 19:35.519
and hope they'll give us a
clue as to which bin, or bins,

19:35.519 --> 19:38.719
the body parts were dumped in. We've
already collected some evidence -

19:38.719 --> 19:40.879
papers, letters, business details

19:40.879 --> 19:42.599
that were in contact
with some of the body parts.

19:42.599 --> 19:43.759
I'll go through those.

19:43.759 --> 19:46.239
Which means that...?
You coming back here

19:46.239 --> 19:48.760
first thing tomorrow and seeing what
you can find. Right.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.040
So, let's have a look.

20:35.121 --> 20:37.322
CLARISSA: I'd like to take
something back.

20:37.322 --> 20:38.922
A stick of rock? Hmph!

20:38.922 --> 20:40.482
Hmm...

20:43.202 --> 20:47.202
Shells. I used to love listening
to them - you know, the sea,

20:47.202 --> 20:50.122
and I'd be off on a ship,
sailing the seven seas.

20:50.122 --> 20:52.322
Hmm. What about a wooden
seagull? Hmm?

21:00.883 --> 21:03.043
Here we go. Perfect.

21:04.883 --> 21:07.003
Where...where are we going?

21:13.163 --> 21:14.923
Lovely as this is, Jack,

21:14.923 --> 21:18.483
it's just downtown Tokyo
rather than Brighton.

21:18.483 --> 21:21.163
A lot of people come to Brighton
just to get one of these.

21:21.163 --> 21:22.563
You mean a tattoo?

21:22.563 --> 21:24.764
Don't tell me you've never
thought about getting one.

21:24.764 --> 21:28.284
I've thought about it,
and then I thought about how my
mother would react.

21:28.284 --> 21:30.844
How your mother would react! Bet you
still got one, didn't you?

21:32.764 --> 21:34.644
When did you get yours done?

21:34.644 --> 21:36.404
15. I told them I was 19.

21:36.404 --> 21:39.244
And they believed you? They believed
in the money, all right.

21:39.244 --> 21:40.404
Can I help you?

21:45.004 --> 21:48.645
This is what you should get.

21:48.645 --> 21:50.805
Is that done by hand or machine?

21:50.805 --> 21:54.605
All done by hand,
in the traditional way.

21:54.605 --> 21:58.445
I bet that hurt. Of course.
But the pain was worth it.

21:58.445 --> 21:59.565
Is that cherry blossom?

21:59.565 --> 22:04.445
Cherry blossom falls, scattered
by the four great winds.

22:04.445 --> 22:06.285
Life is but fleeting.

22:09.925 --> 22:12.166
Did you get that done here?
Yeah.

22:12.166 --> 22:13.606
A few years ago now.

22:13.606 --> 22:16.886
The colours -
nothing has faded.

22:16.886 --> 22:19.406
I wish I could do work as good
as this.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.046
So who did it?

22:21.046 --> 22:24.006
MK. But he's not here right now.

22:24.006 --> 22:25.206
He travels around a lot,

22:25.206 --> 22:27.286
but I think he is due back in
Brighton soon.

22:27.286 --> 22:30.846
If you leave your number with me, I
can see if I can contact him.

22:30.846 --> 22:33.486
How long are you here for?
A few days,

22:33.486 --> 22:36.647
a week. Does this tattooist have a
name?

22:36.647 --> 22:40.407
This is his unique signature.
Hori Cho Cho.

22:40.407 --> 22:41.767
Sorry?

22:41.767 --> 22:44.487
The...the carving butterfly.

22:47.447 --> 22:50.967
Thanks. I'll be in touch.
Brilliant. Thanks.

22:54.927 --> 22:56.967
How come you know Japanese?

22:56.967 --> 22:58.448
How come you don't?

23:05.608 --> 23:08.408
Sorry. I was busy earlier.
I couldn't answer...

23:08.408 --> 23:10.528
KNOCK ON DOOR
Wait a second...

23:10.528 --> 23:12.728
Your one-thirty.
I'll be right there.

23:12.728 --> 23:14.848
I'm just...
And the press briefing...

23:14.848 --> 23:16.328
I got it. Thanks, Audrey.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.728
You sound busy.

23:17.728 --> 23:21.248
Bat-shit crazy. Starting a new
campaign never gets easier.

23:21.248 --> 23:23.729
But I always have time for
you. I miss you.

23:23.729 --> 23:26.769
I miss you, too. Can you still
come over next weekend?

23:26.769 --> 23:28.329
God willing.

23:30.809 --> 23:32.009
Nikki?

23:33.609 --> 23:35.569
I, um...

23:35.569 --> 23:37.249
KNOCK ON DOOR

23:37.249 --> 23:40.369
Sorry, sir, but he's not waiting.

23:41.369 --> 23:44.289
You'd better go. We can talk
later. It's fine.

23:44.289 --> 23:45.970
No, no, no. We're talking right
now. OK?

23:45.970 --> 23:47.370
So, what's going on in Brighton?

23:47.370 --> 23:49.050
I'm sure you've seen
some gruesome stuff.

23:49.050 --> 23:52.970
Gruesome body parts, but with the
most amazing tattoos on them.

23:52.970 --> 23:54.730
Don't get me started. Kelly
just got back

23:54.730 --> 23:56.970
from a trip and she got a
tattoo. Can you believe it?

23:56.970 --> 23:59.930
I thought you liked them.
You said you liked mine.

23:59.930 --> 24:01.850
It's not the tattoo, she was always
going to get one,

24:01.850 --> 24:04.210
she just promised she wouldn't do it
till after she graduated college.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.010
Makes me wonder what else
she's getting up to.

24:06.010 --> 24:08.330
Well, if she's anything like I
was at her age, then...

24:08.330 --> 24:09.891
KNOCK ON DOOR

24:11.011 --> 24:13.811
Sir? OK, just send him through.
I'm sorry.

24:13.811 --> 24:16.251
Nikki, I'm so sorry. I have a major
donor who's threatening

24:16.251 --> 24:17.491
to walk out on me if I don't...

24:17.491 --> 24:19.211
OK. Right.

24:19.211 --> 24:21.251
I'll call you later. I love you.

24:38.572 --> 24:41.252
You all right to drive?

24:41.252 --> 24:43.172
You go safe now, yeah?

26:27.656 --> 26:29.656
Now, collapsed sinuses
in the groin.

26:34.097 --> 26:36.297
Pock marks to the lower limb.

26:36.297 --> 26:38.737
Do you see? Mm-hm.

26:38.737 --> 26:42.257
Looks like intravenous drug use at
some point in this man's life.

26:46.297 --> 26:48.417
He was stabbed in the heart.

26:51.097 --> 26:56.057
Upper end of the wound
is 10cm below the clavicle,

26:56.057 --> 27:00.218
6...no, 7cm left of the midline.

27:08.898 --> 27:11.778
Judging from this, the blade
entered the left ventricle

27:11.778 --> 27:13.618
causing a cardiac tamponade.

27:19.658 --> 27:23.539
I can't see any obvious incision or
defence wounds to the forearms.

27:23.539 --> 27:26.939
Maybe he didn't have time
to protect himself. Hmm.

27:32.179 --> 27:35.979
The fatal injury was a vertically
positioned stab wound to the chest.

27:37.299 --> 27:41.139
The track...yeah, appears to
be angled downwards,

27:41.139 --> 27:43.459
angled in towards the midline.

28:23.781 --> 28:27.221
Last night, me and Clarissa found
this place.

28:27.221 --> 28:29.341
We met a tattooist - Bex.

28:29.341 --> 28:32.342
She knows an irezumi artist.
Did you get their name?

28:32.342 --> 28:35.862
His tattooist name is
Carving Butterfly,

28:35.862 --> 28:38.982
but better known as MK.
He doesn't have a real name?

28:38.982 --> 28:41.902
She's gonna call me later.
I'll get someone down there.

28:41.902 --> 28:43.182
Thanks. Uh-huh.

28:44.702 --> 28:46.342
You all ready for this?

28:46.342 --> 28:48.662
No breakfast, and I'm sucking
mints.

28:50.102 --> 28:52.422
I love the smell of festering
rubbish in the morning.

28:52.422 --> 28:53.982
HE CHUCKLES
Very good.

29:09.263 --> 29:10.343
Sir?

29:14.823 --> 29:16.383
Thank you.

29:17.663 --> 29:19.184
HE EXHALES

29:25.664 --> 29:28.864
Here's another one.
Bloodstains?

29:28.864 --> 29:31.704
Blood...or ketchup.

29:48.065 --> 29:49.585
Looks like blood to me.

29:49.585 --> 29:53.065
We'll get it tested, see if it
matches the dead man's.

29:53.065 --> 29:57.225
This is in Church Street.
Hmm. At the far end.

29:57.225 --> 30:00.985
So far, we've got letters addressed
to three houses and two businesses

30:00.985 --> 30:02.825
at the western end
of Church Street.

30:02.825 --> 30:04.905
Clarissa will be thrilled.

30:04.905 --> 30:07.106
We're closer to identifying the
dead body.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.666
Yeah, but mainly because it
was her idea.

30:41.827 --> 30:43.267
Hmm.

30:54.308 --> 30:55.468
Teeth.

30:55.468 --> 30:56.868
Two of them.

30:58.068 --> 30:59.748
In his stomach?
Mm-hm.

30:59.748 --> 31:01.868
Knocked out and swallowed?

31:01.868 --> 31:04.188
I've seen it happen to people
in road traffic collisions,

31:04.188 --> 31:05.708
where their teeth have been
hit so hard...

31:05.708 --> 31:08.668
Could he have been tortured?
The teeth pulled out

31:08.668 --> 31:10.548
and the man then forced to
swallow them?

31:10.548 --> 31:12.828
If this is yakuza related,

31:12.828 --> 31:15.108
torture is their stock-in trade.

32:12.231 --> 32:16.111
Male aged between 30 and 40.

32:17.151 --> 32:19.831
He was in the past
an intravenous drug user.

32:19.831 --> 32:22.631
Anything from Missing
Persons? Not yet.

32:22.631 --> 32:24.311
Did you speak to that tattooist
I told you about?

32:24.311 --> 32:26.031
I've called her,
we're meeting her tomorrow.

32:26.031 --> 32:29.632
We have spoken to a number of other
tattooists, two in London,

32:29.632 --> 32:30.872
one in Bristol and Portsmouth.

32:30.872 --> 32:32.832
Did they recognise any of the
tattoos?

32:32.832 --> 32:34.472
Most of them, like Heisuke,

32:34.472 --> 32:37.072
think they were probably done
in Japan by an irezumi master.

32:37.072 --> 32:41.072
So, with little else to go on,
we have evidence

32:41.072 --> 32:44.552
that the body parts were dumped in

32:44.552 --> 32:47.272
this area of Church Street.
So, the only way

32:47.272 --> 32:49.392
of knowing where they were put
before the bin lorry collected them

32:49.392 --> 32:53.033
is to walk along Church Street
and inspect every single bin.

32:53.033 --> 32:56.313
What exactly will we be looking for?
The head and the hands?

32:57.393 --> 32:58.513
Blood.

32:58.513 --> 33:01.273
Most of the body parts were wrapped
in newspaper and bin liners,

33:01.273 --> 33:04.153
but the average body contains five
litres of blood. You chop one up,

33:04.153 --> 33:06.953
you're going to leave a trace, no
matter how conscientious you are.

33:45.715 --> 33:47.875
Morning. Morning.

33:47.875 --> 33:49.595
Bright and early. Yep.

33:50.595 --> 33:53.795
Sorry to interrupt you there.
I was just wondering

33:53.795 --> 33:55.915
if you'd managed to contact MK yet.

33:55.915 --> 33:58.275
Oh. I thought you'd come
here to see me.

33:58.275 --> 33:59.555
Aye, well, that, too.

34:01.555 --> 34:05.796
I've called him a couple of times,
left messages, but that's MK.

34:05.796 --> 34:09.036
Maybe if I call him. What?
Steal my commission?

34:09.036 --> 34:12.835
I'll tell him you gave me his
number. Scout's honour.

34:12.835 --> 34:16.436
I don't believe that you were
ever in the Scouts.

34:16.436 --> 34:18.516
I'll text you his number.

34:18.516 --> 34:20.116
Great.

34:20.116 --> 34:23.436
Hang on. You're not in the
police, are you?

34:23.436 --> 34:24.956
Do I look like police?

34:26.315 --> 34:29.597
They came round here yesterday
wanting to talk to me,

34:29.597 --> 34:33.476
but me and the police, we don't have
a particularly happy history.

34:33.476 --> 34:37.036
Uh-huh? I used to shout a lot, get
arrested.

34:37.036 --> 34:38.837
I still do sometimes.

34:38.837 --> 34:39.996
OK.

34:41.516 --> 34:42.757
Here you go.

34:44.877 --> 34:46.996
Fantastic. Thanks.

34:46.996 --> 34:51.317
Much appreciated. You sure there's
nothing else I can interest you in?

34:51.317 --> 34:52.878
I mean, I can't do irezumi,

34:52.878 --> 34:55.598
but there's plenty more things I
could offer.

34:56.757 --> 34:57.918
Mmm.

35:15.398 --> 35:17.759
DOGS BARK

35:20.639 --> 35:23.479
MK's phone number.
How did you get that?

35:23.479 --> 35:25.839
I went to that place twice,
and I rang her.

35:27.519 --> 35:29.199
Shall we start?

35:31.359 --> 35:34.199
That's the problem with
cadaver dogs.

35:35.239 --> 35:38.799
They're brilliant,
but they're trained on pork.

35:38.799 --> 35:40.800
These bins must be driving them mad.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.040
Some water?

35:42.040 --> 35:43.200
Thanks.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.080
Thanks for helping out with this.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.720
Checking bins?
Top of my bucket list.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.200
JACK CHUCKLES

35:55.520 --> 35:57.080
Ready? Yeah.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.680
JACK GASPS

36:04.801 --> 36:06.841
FLIES BUZZ

36:13.761 --> 36:15.881
Do you ever think about being a dad?

36:17.001 --> 36:18.321
Yeah, sometimes.

36:22.721 --> 36:24.761
Unlike you, I haven't found anyone

36:24.761 --> 36:27.442
who'll put up with me long enough to
find out.

36:29.322 --> 36:31.362
Is that what you've been
thinking about?

36:31.362 --> 36:33.962
Doesn't everyone
at some point in their life?

36:33.962 --> 36:35.602
Anything?

36:35.602 --> 36:37.002
Not yet.

36:41.762 --> 36:43.002
Well...

36:44.242 --> 36:46.042
..I think he'd be mad to say no.

36:53.163 --> 36:55.123
JACK: Just another 3,000 to go, huh?

37:25.004 --> 37:27.524
SHE GASPS
You've got to stop him! Carola?

37:28.764 --> 37:30.164
What are you doing here?

37:30.164 --> 37:32.124
You're in
hospital, you have sepsis.

37:32.124 --> 37:35.044
Where's Guy? Does he know?
We're trying to contact him.

37:35.044 --> 37:38.124
Guy... He said he was going
back to the boat.

37:39.125 --> 37:40.725
SHE MUTTERS

38:48.727 --> 38:50.128
JACK: Over here.

38:59.568 --> 39:01.968
DOG WHINES

39:11.328 --> 39:12.568
Huh?

39:20.809 --> 39:23.049
This could be blood.
This is blood.

39:23.049 --> 39:24.689
Excuse me.

39:24.689 --> 39:26.889
What are you doing?
Sorry?

39:26.889 --> 39:28.249
You live here?

39:28.249 --> 39:30.529
No, I work at the estate agent's
that rents out these flats.

39:30.529 --> 39:32.569
What's going on?

39:32.569 --> 39:33.809
Who are you people?

39:36.089 --> 39:39.130
Stephen's not here right now.
He owns the flats?

39:39.130 --> 39:41.250
No, we just act as agents.
And you are...?

39:41.250 --> 39:42.810
Andrew. Andrew Dewey.

39:42.810 --> 39:44.850
When will Stephen be back?
I'm not sure.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.730
He's not been in for a couple
of days.

39:46.730 --> 39:48.210
I can give him a call,
if you like.

39:48.210 --> 39:51.250
I'm assuming you've got a record of
who was using the apartments

39:51.250 --> 39:52.770
over the last few weeks.

39:52.770 --> 39:54.610
Yeah. I'll print you a copy.

39:54.610 --> 39:56.090
How do they book?

39:56.090 --> 40:00.050
Mostly online. Some call,
some just walk in. It depends.

40:00.050 --> 40:01.691
And they pay cash or card?

40:01.691 --> 40:04.291
Mostly card or PayPal.

40:04.291 --> 40:06.651
The apartments are owned
by different people.

40:07.771 --> 40:11.691
Hi, Stephen. The police and some
other people in masks

40:11.691 --> 40:14.091
want to talk to you about
the booking last week.

40:14.091 --> 40:16.131
They also want to look at the Church
Street holiday apartments.

40:16.131 --> 40:17.971
Call me.

40:17.971 --> 40:21.451
Do you have keys for all the Church
Street apartments?

40:21.451 --> 40:22.731
I'm not sure I have the authority,

40:22.731 --> 40:25.652
and most of them are occupied right
now. It's a very busy time.

40:25.652 --> 40:28.932
Summertime in Brighton. We're
conducting a murder investigation.

40:28.932 --> 40:31.252
We need those keys.

40:31.252 --> 40:33.052
Who's been murdered?

40:33.052 --> 40:36.332
If you could help us it would be
greatly appreciated. Yeah.

40:41.892 --> 40:44.052
This is a master key -
it opens all the apartments.

40:47.612 --> 40:50.253
Printer's not working, sorry.

40:50.253 --> 40:56.613
According to this, all the
apartments were booked out
last week except number 3.

40:56.613 --> 40:59.093
E-mail me what you've got
there. Here.

40:59.093 --> 41:01.973
- Thanks.
- Sorry, what's happened?

41:01.973 --> 41:04.013
It's just Stephen... As I said,

41:04.013 --> 41:06.413
I've not seen him in a couple
of days.

41:06.413 --> 41:08.253
And that's unusual?

41:08.253 --> 41:11.013
No, he does have to travel for
work sometimes. I just...

41:11.013 --> 41:16.254
When I know anything more, I'll let
you know, and if Stephen calls...

41:16.254 --> 41:18.414
Yeah, I'll tell you.
And get me the names

41:18.414 --> 41:20.294
and contact details
for the last few weeks.

42:22.296 --> 42:23.656
Detective?

42:27.577 --> 42:29.417
Do we know if anyone's in this
one?

42:35.017 --> 42:36.657
KNOCK ON DOOR

42:38.377 --> 42:40.097
Hello?

42:49.018 --> 42:51.698
By the smell of it, someone's been
using a lot of bleach in here.

42:51.698 --> 42:54.298
Yeah. We should find out when the
apartment was last cleaned.

42:54.298 --> 42:57.778
When was this apartment -
number 3 - last occupied?

42:57.778 --> 43:00.898
I'm not sure, the printer's broken.
He's going to send me the list.

43:00.898 --> 43:03.458
He did say that apartment 3
was unoccupied last week.

43:03.458 --> 43:05.258
I'll find out some more.

43:26.659 --> 43:28.699
If this is where the body
was dismembered,

43:28.699 --> 43:31.219
someone must have been in
here for quite some time.

43:31.219 --> 43:32.939
Yes, I'll send you the details.

43:32.939 --> 43:34.899
Can you just give me your
e-mail address?

43:39.300 --> 43:41.020
Thank you. Goodbye.

43:41.020 --> 43:44.340
Sorry. I managed to get
the printer working again.

43:44.340 --> 43:45.900
The list of all the apartments

43:45.900 --> 43:48.380
and who was in them last
week and the week before.

43:48.380 --> 43:50.220
Names, addresses and
payment details.

43:50.220 --> 43:51.940
But no-one
in apartment 3 last week?

43:51.940 --> 43:55.220
Stephen deals mainly with the rental
side of the business,

43:55.220 --> 43:58.140
but it doesn't look like it.

43:58.140 --> 44:01.021
Are you and Stephen the only people
who have access to the flats?

44:01.021 --> 44:02.821
We don't go into them,
we just hand over the keys,

44:02.821 --> 44:04.021
and organise the cleaning and so on.

44:04.021 --> 44:06.941
Is it possible that someone else
could access the apartment?

44:06.941 --> 44:08.901
Not to my knowledge.

44:08.901 --> 44:11.501
The only people I can think of
are the people who own it.

44:11.501 --> 44:12.821
They live in the Algarve.

44:12.821 --> 44:15.621
I can print off their details, if
you like. Thank you.

44:15.621 --> 44:17.741
Do they often come over
and use the apartment?

44:17.741 --> 44:20.981
Not to my knowledge. I'm sure
they would have contacted us

44:20.981 --> 44:24.222
to make sure we didn't rent it
out if they did.

44:24.222 --> 44:25.542
Here you go. Thank you.

44:29.022 --> 44:31.382
And when was apartment 3
last cleaned?

44:32.662 --> 44:35.902
That was empty,
so...five, six days ago?

44:37.582 --> 44:40.742
Has something happened in there?

44:40.742 --> 44:42.662
Have you got a photo of Stephen?

44:42.662 --> 44:43.982
Why?

44:43.982 --> 44:45.302
You said he was missing.

44:51.463 --> 44:52.743
Is Stephen your boyfriend?

44:52.743 --> 44:55.823
We don't live together or anything
like that. We just...

44:56.983 --> 44:58.583
..go out.

45:02.303 --> 45:04.503
Does he have any tattoos?

45:04.503 --> 45:06.303
Tattoos?

45:06.303 --> 45:07.503
No.

45:07.503 --> 45:08.943
No. Does that mean...?

45:08.943 --> 45:11.944
Send me Stephen's photo
and details. We'll be in touch.

45:18.504 --> 45:21.544
NIKKI: Whoever cleaned this place
has done a pretty thorough job.

45:47.985 --> 45:50.065
How tall are you, Detective?
6ft.

45:50.065 --> 45:51.465
Really?

45:51.465 --> 45:53.985
5'11"...with my shoes on.

45:53.985 --> 45:56.145
We estimate the height of the
dead man

45:56.145 --> 45:59.506
to be 5'10", so that should be about
right. Would you mind?

46:01.066 --> 46:02.986
Stand here for me.

46:02.986 --> 46:06.986
Now, it's hard to determine if this
happened in the last few days,

46:06.986 --> 46:09.826
but it appears someone was pushed
violently against this wall.

46:09.826 --> 46:11.986
With enough force
to knock his teeth out?

46:11.986 --> 46:14.066
Mm-hm. Cessation cast-off.
See that?

46:14.066 --> 46:16.866
As the object - in this case,
the man's head -

46:16.866 --> 46:17.986
hits the wall...

46:20.506 --> 46:24.507
..blood is cast off,
causing the fine spatters.

46:24.507 --> 46:26.067
Jack? Detective?

46:42.147 --> 46:44.027
Attacked in the hallway...

46:47.828 --> 46:50.148
..and then dragged into the
bathroom...

46:50.148 --> 46:52.948
..and then cut up in the bath.

47:06.868 --> 47:09.148
Mick? Keryn.

47:09.148 --> 47:11.909
If you're coming to see me,
you can piss off.

47:12.949 --> 47:14.989
I lost my phone.

47:14.989 --> 47:17.589
I knew it was a one-nighter but you
could have at least said goodbye.

47:17.589 --> 47:19.189
I didn't want to wake you.
Bollocks.

47:19.189 --> 47:23.269
Look, you can't tell anyone
I was with you.

47:23.269 --> 47:25.149
No more messages.

47:25.149 --> 47:27.269
I thought you lost your phone.

47:28.709 --> 47:30.709
Just make sure you lose my number.

47:30.709 --> 47:32.389
Yeah?

48:58.393 --> 48:59.913
Possible murder weapons?

49:01.153 --> 49:02.513
Possibly.

49:25.754 --> 49:26.834
Hungry?

49:26.834 --> 49:28.674
I've seen this.
What?

49:29.874 --> 49:31.394
This logo.

49:31.394 --> 49:33.555
It's a pizza place on the front.

49:35.835 --> 49:38.155
A moped.

49:39.675 --> 49:41.275
A moped with this logo on it.

49:47.595 --> 49:48.675
Excuse me...

49:48.675 --> 49:51.155
Excuse me!

49:51.155 --> 49:53.035
He's taking the moped!

49:58.876 --> 50:02.156
He was wearing a black
hoodie, dark trousers...

50:02.156 --> 50:04.756
And the moped - it looked like
it had been in an accident.

50:04.756 --> 50:06.396
Yes, the main light and indicator

50:06.396 --> 50:09.156
were broken, I think there's debris
from it here.

50:09.156 --> 50:11.756
It was reported stolen by the Sea
View pizza restaurant

50:11.756 --> 50:14.236
on Thursday night. Shit!

50:15.836 --> 50:19.516
But if it was the killer,
why risk taking the moped?

50:19.516 --> 50:21.877
Incriminating evidence?
Something in the box maybe.

50:21.877 --> 50:24.477
We need to set up a
door-to-door.

50:24.477 --> 50:27.037
If that moped was involved
in an accident on this street

50:27.037 --> 50:29.837
someone will have seen something,
or at least heard it.

50:29.837 --> 50:31.637
FLIES BUZZ

50:33.277 --> 50:34.797
Jack?

51:32.680 --> 51:34.240
Stop!

51:34.240 --> 51:35.720
Stop the work!

51:43.640 --> 51:46.440
The commercial waste is
collected

51:46.440 --> 51:48.800
depending on the contract
we have with the customer.

51:48.800 --> 51:51.600
Sometimes it's daily,
twice a week, or whatever.

51:51.600 --> 51:53.440
And the bin in Church Street?

51:53.440 --> 51:56.961
That came in this morning and, as I
say, was emptied in that area.

51:56.961 --> 51:58.961
Usually they check the contents of
the bins

51:58.961 --> 52:00.641
before they put them into
the lorry,

52:00.641 --> 52:02.801
but the driver says he didn't
see anything untoward.

52:02.801 --> 52:04.721
Detective Taramelli?

52:07.481 --> 52:10.161
We've found a dismembered hand.

52:12.121 --> 52:14.801
I'm assuming they did this
on purpose -

52:14.801 --> 52:18.562
put most of the body parts in one
bin, the head and the hands...

52:18.562 --> 52:19.762
Hold on...

52:21.162 --> 52:22.402
Is that the head?

52:26.042 --> 52:28.682
The left arm with an irezumi.

52:31.242 --> 52:33.482
But we already have a left
arm...

52:34.802 --> 52:36.642
Detective?

52:46.283 --> 52:47.643
There...

52:48.683 --> 52:50.003
There...

52:54.363 --> 52:56.803
A second dismembered body.

52:58.843 --> 53:01.763
Right, let's get a full team in
here as quickly as we can.

53:01.763 --> 53:04.323
I want this place sealed off and
every part of that body found.

53:04.323 --> 53:08.044
Yes, sir. What can you tell us?
Anything.

53:09.524 --> 53:12.844
We'll find out more when we do the
postmortem back at the Lyell.

54:20.727 --> 54:22.447
What time's Matt calling you?

54:24.927 --> 54:27.407
He said before midnight.

54:27.407 --> 54:29.327
His midnight or your midnight?

54:31.207 --> 54:33.007
That's the problem.

54:35.647 --> 54:38.727
You know what we were
talking about earlier?

54:38.727 --> 54:40.127
Years ago, I was...

54:41.688 --> 54:43.968
..seeing a woman,
I was very close to her,

54:43.968 --> 54:46.288
and she called up,

54:46.288 --> 54:48.368
she asked me if I wanted kids.

54:49.848 --> 54:51.608
I was so surprised.

54:51.608 --> 54:53.728
What, you didn't answer her?

54:53.728 --> 54:55.008
I did, but...

54:55.008 --> 54:57.568
..she heard the silence.

55:01.568 --> 55:04.728
Had she been in the room,
well, who knows?

55:04.728 --> 55:06.929
Might have turned out different.

55:11.289 --> 55:13.249
Know what I'm saying?

55:13.249 --> 55:14.689
Yeah.

55:15.729 --> 55:17.649
Yeah.

55:19.369 --> 55:20.729
See you tomorrow.

55:22.169 --> 55:23.209
Yeah.

55:24.969 --> 55:26.369
Thanks.

55:54.451 --> 55:56.091
Ruby.

56:28.252 --> 56:29.932
Ooh, sorry. My bad.
