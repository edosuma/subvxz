WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:04.072
Oh, hey, Kevin.
Nice of you to join us.

00:04.105 --> 00:05.206
Where were you?

00:05.239 --> 00:07.475
My tire blew out
on the way here, Michael.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.776
Uh-huh.
I almost died.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.144
I went into this skid--

00:10.178 --> 00:11.779
Pop quiz.
What?

00:11.812 --> 00:13.347
Why is today
a special day?

00:13.381 --> 00:15.083
(Kevin)
I almost died.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.250
Today is a special day

00:16.284 --> 00:19.087
because I am being honored

00:19.120 --> 00:23.424
as a visiting professor...

00:24.525 --> 00:26.360
special lecturer emeritus...

00:26.394 --> 00:27.795
How did you--
How did you put it?

00:27.828 --> 00:29.297
You will be a guest speaker

00:29.330 --> 00:30.831
in my Emerging Enterprises
class.

00:30.864 --> 00:34.435
In business school,
Kevin.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.670
Business school.
Wow.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.239
If you bring your boss
to class,

00:38.272 --> 00:41.609
it automatically bumps you up
a full letter grade.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.144
So...

00:43.177 --> 00:47.348
I'd be stupid
not to do it, right?

00:47.381 --> 00:49.717
A boss is like a teacher.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.420
And I am like
the cool teacher.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.188
Like Mr. Handell.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.790
Mr. Handell would
hang out with us.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.293
And he would tell us
awesome jokes.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.862
And he actually hooked up
with one of the students.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.433
Um, and then like 12 other
kids came forward.

01:05.466 --> 01:08.269
It was in all the papers.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.371
Really ruined eighth grade
for us.

01:12.340 --> 01:15.309
[cheerful music]

01:15.343 --> 01:23.351
*

01:32.893 --> 01:34.828
Here we go.
College road show.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.797
Gotta bring our A game.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.566
What is
the most inspiring thing

01:38.599 --> 01:39.867
I ever said to you?

01:39.900 --> 01:43.604
"Don't be an idiot."
Changed my life.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.873
Whenever I'm about
to do something, I think,

01:45.906 --> 01:47.408
"Would an idiot do that?"

01:47.441 --> 01:50.811
And if they would,
I do not do that thing.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.681
Will they throw
their hats, you think?

01:53.714 --> 01:54.648
What?

01:54.682 --> 01:58.852
A lot times at a school
or naval academy,

01:58.886 --> 02:01.455
after a rousing speech,
the crowd will throw its hats

02:01.489 --> 02:02.623
high into the air.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.425
You understand
nobody's graduating.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.759
Yeah, I know, I know.

02:05.793 --> 02:06.894
I'm just saying,
if they did throw their hats,

02:06.927 --> 02:10.298
I've got a great line
for that.

02:10.331 --> 02:15.169
May your hats fly
as high as your dreams.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.873
Thought it was
a pretty good line.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.676
Just--it doesn't apply.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.712
I understand.
Wow.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.880
Relax, spazzy boy.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.349
Sometimes you're such
a little spazz!

02:28.382 --> 02:29.717
God, I'm driving!
[blabbering]

02:29.750 --> 02:31.585
Quit it!
We have fun.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.722
I can't wait
for your art show tonight.

02:34.755 --> 02:35.889
Okay, just so you know,

02:35.923 --> 02:37.391
it's just the students
from my class

02:37.425 --> 02:38.859
in a little studio.

02:38.892 --> 02:39.960
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.529
Thanks.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.964
I'm really happy
to be back with Roy.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.900
I think it shows maturity.

02:46.934 --> 02:50.671
Maturity and dignity.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.872
Is that braggy?

02:51.905 --> 02:54.508
I don't mean it
to be braggy.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.511
Love you.
You too.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.781
(Jim)
Pam's with Roy.
I'm with Karen.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.484
And Brangelina
is with Frangelina.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.654
Moving on.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.522
I can't believe you're
back together with Roy.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.923
Oh, yeah.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.326
We have such a solid
foundation, you know.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.828
Oh, my God.
You're so in love now.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.829
Yeah.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.666
Oh, you should come
to my art show, by the way.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.401
Oh, art show.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.969
I mean, it's not a big deal.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.304
But I think
a lot of people

03:23.337 --> 03:24.938
from the office
are gonna be there.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.874
Oh, yeah.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.843
Definitely I'll be there,
for sure.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.447
Campus.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.549
Brings back
so many memories...

03:35.583 --> 03:37.585
that I would've made.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.753
Hey, Frisbee.
Check that out--oh!

03:39.787 --> 03:41.989
What do you say we get
our Fris on

03:42.022 --> 03:43.391
before class, huh?

03:45.993 --> 03:48.496
Yeah! Woo!

03:50.364 --> 03:52.566
Dude.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.909
Oh, my God.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.883
Animal stool.

04:21.729 --> 04:22.796
Dwight,
what are you doing?

04:22.830 --> 04:25.333
Solving a mystery, if that's
quite all right with you.

04:32.005 --> 04:35.743
Come to papa.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.811
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.813
What we have here is a bird

04:39.847 --> 04:42.683
that has been trapped
in a vent.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.685
Fortunately,
I have found it before--

04:44.718 --> 04:46.487
Bat! Bat!

04:46.520 --> 04:48.722
[Meredith screams]
Bat! Bat!

04:48.756 --> 04:50.558
Oh, my God.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.493
(Dwight)
Bat!

04:52.526 --> 04:54.928
No, everyone remain calm!

04:54.962 --> 04:57.698
[Meredith screams]

04:57.731 --> 04:58.832
There it goes!

04:58.866 --> 05:00.100
Good-bye.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.303
[Meredith screams]

05:07.475 --> 05:09.042
Okay, this is it.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.579
Ryan is doing my intro
right now.

05:11.612 --> 05:14.815
Dunder Mifflin can't compete
with the modern chains,

05:14.848 --> 05:18.552
and management is unwilling
or unable to adapt.

05:18.586 --> 05:19.787
Their customers
are dying off...

05:21.922 --> 05:22.790
I can't hear
what he's saying,

05:22.823 --> 05:26.627
but he looks like
he's really into it.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.364
[squeaking]

05:30.398 --> 05:31.899
Aah!

05:31.932 --> 05:34.702
We have a bat
in the office.

05:34.735 --> 05:38.606
The simple solution would be
to open a window.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.574
If we had windows
that could open.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.644
Poop is raining
from the ceilings.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.778
Poop!

05:44.812 --> 05:47.481
Okay, thanks.

05:47.515 --> 05:50.117
Animal Control
will be here at 6:00.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.852
At 6:00?

05:51.885 --> 05:53.887
No, that is
unacceptable.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.856
Okay, Jim, you are
the number two in this office.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.125
You need to step up
and show some leadership.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.927
I'm sorry,
what did you say?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.128
So weird.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.063
What?
What's so weird?

06:03.096 --> 06:04.097
The bat.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.132
I mean, I know
I felt it bite me.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.767
But look, there's no mark.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.903
I feel so...

06:09.937 --> 06:11.972
tingly.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.542
So strangely powerful.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.812
Oh, well.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.085
And now,
without further ado,

06:25.118 --> 06:28.422
I present the regional manager
of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton,

06:28.456 --> 06:30.057
Michael Scott.

06:30.090 --> 06:33.060
[classical music plays]

06:33.093 --> 06:38.799
*

06:38.832 --> 06:41.569
[clears throat]

06:41.602 --> 06:44.605
Hello, everyone.
I am Michael Scott.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.073
[man on tape]
Hello, I'm Tom Rollins,

06:46.106 --> 06:48.408
president of
The Teaching Company--

06:49.910 --> 06:52.212
And I'd like
to start today

06:52.245 --> 06:54.648
by inspiring you.

06:54.682 --> 06:55.949
May I borrow

06:55.983 --> 06:58.886
someone's textbook, please?

06:58.919 --> 07:01.121
Thank you.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.556
What have we here?

07:02.590 --> 07:04.492
Ooh, economics.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.995
Very, very interesting.

07:10.931 --> 07:14.101
You cannot learn...

07:14.134 --> 07:16.203
from books.

07:16.236 --> 07:20.608
Replace these pages...

07:20.641 --> 07:22.075
with life lessons.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.645
And then...

07:24.678 --> 07:28.849
you will have a book...

07:28.882 --> 07:32.152
that is worth
its weight in gold.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.855
I know
these are expensive,

07:34.888 --> 07:37.825
um, but the lesson
is priceless.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.861
Good.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.596
All right, I think
you're inspired.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.597
Shall we proceed?

07:43.631 --> 07:46.534
There are four kinds
of business.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.936
Tourism.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.804
Food service.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.205
Railroads.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.141
And sales.

07:54.174 --> 07:58.145
And hospitals/manufacturing.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.713
And air travel.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.786
This is your job, Halpert.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.854
(Jim)
Ow!

08:06.887 --> 08:08.656
What happened?

08:08.689 --> 08:10.724
(Jim)
That bread on your desk?
I just picked it up.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.793
It's white-hot.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.294
But, Jim,

08:14.327 --> 08:15.863
this garlic bread is cold.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.065
What?

08:18.098 --> 08:19.867
No.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.103
It burned me.
I--

08:23.136 --> 08:24.672
Bizarre.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.911
One crisis at a time.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.980
If a vampire bat
was in the U.S.,

08:33.013 --> 08:36.083
it would make sense for it
to come to a "sylvania."

08:36.116 --> 08:37.918
Like Penn-sylvania.

08:37.951 --> 08:42.289
Now, that doesn't mean that Jim
is gonna become a vampire.

08:42.322 --> 08:45.292
Only that he carries
the vampiric germ.

08:45.325 --> 08:48.328
So...you want to start
a business?

08:48.361 --> 08:49.830
How do you start?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.031
What do you need?

08:51.064 --> 08:53.967
Well, first of all,
you need a building.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.871
And secondly,
you need supply.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.273
You need something
to sell.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.910
Now, this could be anything.

09:02.943 --> 09:06.213
It could be a thingamajig

09:06.246 --> 09:08.782
or a whosi-whatsi.

09:08.816 --> 09:12.052
Or...a "Whatchamacallit."

09:13.887 --> 09:17.090
Now, you need to sell those

09:17.124 --> 09:22.095
in order to have
a "PayDay."

09:22.129 --> 09:26.233
And if you sell
enough of them,

09:26.266 --> 09:31.138
you will make a "100 Grand."

09:33.173 --> 09:35.208
Satisfied?

09:35.242 --> 09:36.844
Oh, this looks great.

09:36.877 --> 09:37.945
I'd love to be there,

09:37.978 --> 09:41.114
but my daughter's play
is tonight.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.717
Damn it.

09:43.751 --> 09:44.885
You know,
one of the other parents

09:44.918 --> 09:46.319
will probably
videotape it.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.956
Oh, no.
You should go.

09:48.989 --> 09:52.960
Well, it's important
to support to local art.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.595
And--and what they do
is not art.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.800
Okay, I'm seeing some
confused faces out there.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.635
Let me slow down a little bit.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.203
Break this down.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.972
Okay.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.975
The more stickers you sell,
the more profit--

10:08.008 --> 10:09.242
fancy word for money--

10:09.276 --> 10:12.746
you have to buy PlayStations
and Beanie Babies.

10:12.780 --> 10:13.947
Michael--

10:13.981 --> 10:15.415
And products!
what we normally do here

10:15.448 --> 10:16.884
is more of a question
and answer type thing.

10:16.917 --> 10:17.885
Well, okay.

10:17.918 --> 10:18.919
I was just kind of
getting going.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.153
Yeah, I know.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.221
Um, all right.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.223
Okay, well,
we can do questions.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.958
Very good.
First hand up.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.828
Sir, as a company that
primarily distributes paper,

10:27.861 --> 10:29.930
how have you adapted
your business model

10:29.963 --> 10:32.700
to function in an increasingly
paperless world?

10:32.733 --> 10:36.103
We can't overestimate
the value of computers.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.672
Yes, they are great
for playing games

10:38.706 --> 10:41.008
and forwarding
funny emails.

10:41.041 --> 10:45.979
But real business
is done on paper, okay?

10:46.013 --> 10:47.347
Write that down.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.884
[all typing]

10:53.020 --> 10:54.922
Hey, Jim, here's
the aspirin you wanted.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.690
Oh, thank God.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.358
I have such a headache
from that glare.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.993
What glare?

11:00.027 --> 11:01.895
The glare off
Angela's crucifix.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.898
It's blinding.

11:04.932 --> 11:07.100
I don't have a lot
of experience with vampires,

11:07.134 --> 11:09.002
but I have hunted
werewolves.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.938
I shot one once,

11:10.971 --> 11:12.472
but by the time
I got to it

11:12.505 --> 11:15.408
it had turned back
into my neighbor's dog.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.247
[inhales]

11:20.280 --> 11:21.915
[whispering]
Extraordinary events

11:21.949 --> 11:23.951
call for extraordinary
actions.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.854
We form an allegiance...
Sure.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.723
to use sudden violence.
Okay.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.158
Do you have
the tools to turn

11:31.191 --> 11:33.961
a wooden mop handle
into a stake?

11:35.528 --> 11:37.330
What size?

11:37.364 --> 11:38.899
What do you say
to a customer

11:38.932 --> 11:40.768
who wants to leave you
for the convenience

11:40.801 --> 11:42.235
and savings
of a nationwide chain?

11:42.269 --> 11:44.972
I say, "You will miss
our service.

11:45.005 --> 11:48.041
And I absolutely guarantee
you'll come back."

11:48.075 --> 11:49.342
Has anyone ever come back?

11:50.944 --> 11:52.512
We don't want them back.
They're stupid.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.447
How far has your
Herfindahl Index declined

11:54.481 --> 11:55.448
since the merger?

11:55.482 --> 11:56.784
Nice try.

11:56.817 --> 11:57.985
How's your
Polack-says-what index?

11:58.018 --> 11:58.986
What?

11:59.019 --> 12:00.120
Thanks, Kowalski.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.489
Can we get back
on track here?

12:02.522 --> 12:04.057
By your own employee's
calculation,

12:04.091 --> 12:06.426
you'll be obsolete in the next
five to ten years.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.330
Wait, Ryan said that?

12:19.807 --> 12:22.109
What are you doing?

12:22.142 --> 12:24.144
You better not hurt
that little bat.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.179
Animals can't feel pain.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.514
Don't hurt that bat, Creed!

12:27.547 --> 12:29.349
It's a living thing
with feelings and a family.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.184
(Dwight)
Flush him towards
the door.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.353
On my go...now!

12:33.386 --> 12:34.354
Bat!

12:34.387 --> 12:35.522
Aah! Kill it!

12:35.555 --> 12:38.158
Kill it! Kill it!

12:39.927 --> 12:43.163
I...am a hero.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.100
Yeah, sure,
you know business.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.501
Sitting up here

12:48.535 --> 12:50.370
in your ivory tower.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.572
And your ebony tower.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.007
But you know what?

12:54.041 --> 12:55.175
I'll tell you one thing.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.444
Dunder Mifflin
is here to stay.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.579
But how can you compete
against a company

12:59.612 --> 13:00.848
with the resources
of a nationwide chain?

13:00.881 --> 13:03.450
David will always
beat Goliath.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.918
But there's five Goliaths.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.419
There's Staples,
OfficeMax--

13:06.453 --> 13:07.354
Yeah, yeah.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.190
You know what else
is facing five Goliaths?

13:10.223 --> 13:12.159
America.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.593
Al-Qaeda.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.428
Global warming.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.866
Sex predators.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.168
Mercury poisoning.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.569
So do we just give up?

13:22.602 --> 13:24.972
Is that what we're learning
in business school?

13:25.005 --> 13:25.772
But in the big picture--

13:25.805 --> 13:28.075
Dunder Mifflin is
the big picture.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.342
Can't you understand that?

13:29.376 --> 13:31.011
No, you can't.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.013
You're too young.

13:33.046 --> 13:38.185
Ryan has never
made a sale.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.188
And he started a fire

13:41.221 --> 13:44.024
trying to make
a cheesy pita.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.259
And everybody thinks
he's a tease.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.161
Well, you know what?

13:48.195 --> 13:51.564
He doesn't know anything,
and neither do you.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.439
So suck on that!

14:02.375 --> 14:05.378
[people chattering]

14:21.061 --> 14:22.162
It wasn't personal.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.463
Business is always personal.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.098
It's the most personal thing
in the world.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.934
When we get back
to the office, pack your things.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.035
Pack my--
You heard me.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.037
Pack your things.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.278
[bat squeaking]

14:38.311 --> 14:41.114
I really want to come out!

14:41.148 --> 14:43.250
Good night, Mary Beth!

14:50.290 --> 14:53.526
[water sloshes
in cooler]

14:53.560 --> 14:56.629
So...you're cool
to just wait here

14:56.663 --> 14:58.165
for Animal Control?

14:58.198 --> 15:00.133
Animal Control?

15:00.167 --> 15:03.036
I've been controlling animals
since I was six.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.538
Cool, okay.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.608
I'm gonna go home
and lie down.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.143
Draw the shades.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.379
There's just so much
sun in here.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.452
Bye, Dwight.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.091
Good-bye, Jim.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.061
And good luck.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.700
Jim is on a path now.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.535
An eternal journey.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.737
And I wish him well.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.140
But I have a destiny
in this realm.

15:40.173 --> 15:44.077
Specifically...
in the kitchen.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.979
And it's all from
the same series.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.214
Oh.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.049
Called "Impressions."

15:49.082 --> 15:50.483
Oh.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.052
Not that I would
call myself

15:52.085 --> 15:53.686
an Impressionist,
per se.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.223
But maybe one day.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.557
I hope so.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.691
Hmm.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.493
I still need, you know,

16:00.527 --> 16:02.629
my breakthrough
or whatever.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.468
Hey, babe.
How are you?

16:08.501 --> 16:09.736
Good.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.571
Look who I brought.
My brother, huh?

16:11.604 --> 16:13.340
Hey, Kenny.
Hey, Pam.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.142
Hey.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.377
How about this, huh?

16:17.410 --> 16:18.511
I show up with my brother,

16:18.545 --> 16:22.015
and no one from work
is here.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.416
That's pretty cool, huh?

16:26.086 --> 16:29.722
[Dwight breathing
through mask]

16:29.756 --> 16:32.492
Magic time.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.062
[shouting]

16:35.095 --> 16:37.030
[screaming]

16:40.200 --> 16:42.335
My hair!
Aah, get off!

16:42.369 --> 16:44.804
Get off me!
Get off me!

16:44.837 --> 16:46.106
Get off me!

16:46.139 --> 16:48.541
Hold still, woman!

16:48.575 --> 16:51.044
Oh, my God, my God!

16:51.078 --> 16:54.414
[screaming]

17:01.188 --> 17:02.389
You're welcome.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.761
It's cool if I go,
right?

17:08.795 --> 17:10.097
I mean, I looked
at all of them.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.266
Yeah, I'll just--
I'll drive myself home.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.568
To my place?

17:15.602 --> 17:18.571
Maybe.
I'm a little tired.

17:18.605 --> 17:21.208
Your art
was the prettiest art

17:21.241 --> 17:22.775
of all the art.

17:22.809 --> 17:26.279
Thank you.

17:26.313 --> 17:29.116
Look...

17:29.149 --> 17:30.250
I'm sorry, okay?

17:30.283 --> 17:32.619
I was just trying
to do my presentation.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.522
And of course
I was wrong to suggest

17:35.555 --> 17:38.691
that Dunder Mifflin might
ever go out of business.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.460
But you don't
have to fire me.

17:40.493 --> 17:44.864
Fire you?
No, no, no.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.167
You are moving
to the annex.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.369
To the annex?

17:49.402 --> 17:50.737
Where Kelly is?

17:50.770 --> 17:51.871
A good manager
doesn't fire people.

17:51.904 --> 17:56.776
He hires people
and inspires people.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.645
People, Ryan.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.350
And people will never
go out of business.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.721
You're the one who said
we needed more culture.

18:08.755 --> 18:09.822
This is culture to you?

18:09.856 --> 18:11.291
It's her first try.

18:11.324 --> 18:14.227
Yeah, on Van Gogh's
first try,

18:14.261 --> 18:15.495
he drew the hands
of the peasants.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.297
Meaning what?

18:17.330 --> 18:20.467
Meaning real art
takes courage, okay?

18:20.500 --> 18:21.868
And--and honesty.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.170
Well, those aren't
Pam's strong points.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.871
Yeah, exactly.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.106
That's why this is
motel art.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.446
Thanks for coming.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.896
Pam-casso!
Sorry I'm late.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.564
I had to race
across town.

18:51.598 --> 18:52.865
Oh, Michael.

18:52.899 --> 18:56.203
Wow!

18:56.236 --> 18:58.338
You did these freehand?

18:58.371 --> 18:59.939
Yep.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.409
My God,
these could be tracings.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.843
Oh!

19:03.876 --> 19:06.313
Look at this one.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.847
Wow!

19:07.880 --> 19:09.749
You nailed it.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.888
How much?

19:15.922 --> 19:17.624
What do you mean?

19:17.657 --> 19:20.960
I don't see a price.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.397
Um, you want to buy it?

19:24.431 --> 19:25.565
Well, yeah.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.401
Yeah, we have to have it
for the office.

19:28.435 --> 19:30.970
I mean, there's my window.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.772
And there's my car!

19:32.805 --> 19:34.441
Is that your car?

19:34.474 --> 19:36.443
Uh-huh.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.811
[exhales]

19:40.980 --> 19:42.915
That is our building.

19:46.453 --> 19:48.455
And we sell paper.

19:53.593 --> 19:57.196
I am really proud of you.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.875
Thank you.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.510
What?

20:13.446 --> 20:17.384
Do you have something
in your pocket?

20:18.785 --> 20:20.152
A Chunky.

20:24.023 --> 20:26.259
Do you want half?

20:26.293 --> 20:27.860
No, thank you.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.529
Okay.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.832
(Michael)
It is a message.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.701
It is an inspiration.

20:34.734 --> 20:39.772
It is a source of beauty.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.774
And without paper,

20:41.808 --> 20:45.545
it could not have happened.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.548
Unless you had a camera.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.649
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

20:49.682 --> 20:50.983
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.319
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

20:52.352 --> 20:53.920
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

20:53.953 --> 20:56.022
It's only temporary, okay?
Don't get excited.

20:56.055 --> 20:58.858
I won't, I won't,
I won't.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.660
I won't.
I won't.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.696
I won't, I won't, I won't,
I won't, I won't!
