00:02.540 --> 00:06.630
<b>This little light
I've found</b>

00:08.750 --> 00:12.840
<b>Take it in,
breathe it out</b>

00:15.220 --> 00:19.260
<b>A little drum
that's beating loud</b>

00:21.640 --> 00:26.150
<b>In my chest,
I hear the sound</b>

00:31.320 --> 00:33.780
<b>I can feel</b>

00:33.780 --> 00:36.200
<b>Feel you now</b>

00:36.200 --> 00:39.160
<b>I can feel you now</b>

00:39.160 --> 00:41.830
<b>I can feel</b>

00:41.830 --> 00:45.370
<b>I can feel you now</b>

01:04.240 --> 01:06.400
<b>You're not speaking plainly enough, Hignight.</b>

01:06.400 --> 01:08.800
<b>Do I have a reason to be concerned?</b>

01:09.030 --> 01:11.510
<b><i>No, sir, you don't need to worry.</i></b>

01:13.080 --> 01:14.700
<b>Oh, don't I?</b>

01:14.700 --> 01:17.910
<b>After<i> you</i> were the one who told 
me to not leave the penthouse!</b>

01:18.230 --> 01:21.050
<b><i>That skinjob isn't getting past us, sir.</i></b>

01:21.050 --> 01:22.410
<b><i>We'll keep you safe.</i></b>

01:30.910 --> 01:33.130
<b>Something wrong, Father?</b>

01:34.450 --> 01:35.820
<b>Of course there is.</b>

01:36.130 --> 01:39.690
<b>One of your defective models killed Dr. M,</b>

01:39.690 --> 01:42.870
<b>and now she has my name!</b>

01:44.260 --> 01:50.110
<b>Sometimes the obedient find a way 
to take control of their own life.</b>

01:50.870 --> 01:53.530
<b>You said you had it all under control.</b>

01:53.530 --> 01:56.130
<b>Look what happened to Eldon Tyrell.</b>

01:56.130 --> 01:59.370
<b>These things always end 
up killing their creators.</b>

01:59.800 --> 02:02.610
<b>How do you expect to control nature?</b>

02:02.610 --> 02:05.800
<b>They were meant to be the next 
phase of human evolution.</b>

02:09.590 --> 02:11.530
<b>This was all a mistake.</b>

02:12.090 --> 02:15.560
<b>A terrible, terrible mistake.</b>

02:15.560 --> 02:18.850
<b>But the Hunt was your plan.</b>

02:19.680 --> 02:24.110
<b>You held all of that power, 
and you wasted it.</b>

02:24.800 --> 02:26.030
<b>Betrayed it.</b>

02:27.690 --> 02:31.360
<b>You are but a minor, short-sighted deity.</b>

02:32.200 --> 02:34.790
<b>Saturn eating his children.</b>

02:34.790 --> 02:38.420
<b>If the public finds out, 
it will take you down too.</b>

02:38.840 --> 02:41.550
<b>We need to end this. Quietly.</b>

02:43.000 --> 02:45.440
<b>It's already coming to an end.</b>

02:59.740 --> 03:02.030
<b>Goodbye, Father.</b>

03:08.210 --> 03:10.290
<b>Stop! Where are you going?</b>

03:10.290 --> 03:11.430
<b>Junior!</b>

04:28.710 --> 04:30.580
<b>So you did it.</b>

04:30.580 --> 04:31.690
<b>You killed them.</b>

04:36.200 --> 04:38.280
<b>You were a Blade Runner.</b>

04:49.400 --> 04:51.340
<b>That was a long time ago.</b>

04:51.340 --> 04:54.620
<b>If I wanted to retire you, 
I would have done it by now.</b>

04:58.800 --> 05:00.820
<b>Why come back if you don't trust me?</b>

05:03.350 --> 05:04.870
<b>I want to trust you.</b>

05:11.100 --> 05:13.000
<b>I'm going to kill Niander Wallace.</b>

05:17.960 --> 05:19.220
<b>Senior?</b>

05:25.930 --> 05:27.560
<b>It can't be done.</b>

05:29.170 --> 05:31.550
<b>He was behind the Doll Hunt.</b>

05:31.550 --> 05:34.470
<b>It was a test run for making more replicants.</b>

05:34.990 --> 05:36.350
<b>I have to stop him.</b>

05:37.290 --> 05:39.710
<b>You already killed everyone 
who was actually there.</b>

05:40.620 --> 05:43.160
<b>Forget Wallace and get 
out of LA while you can.</b>

05:55.380 --> 05:57.100
<b>I'm not asking you to help.</b>

05:57.940 --> 05:59.890
<b>I plan on doing this myself.</b>

06:25.360 --> 06:27.570
<b>Where the hell did you come from?</b>

06:53.480 --> 06:55.720
<b>This plan is suicide.</b>

06:57.690 --> 07:00.280
<b>And when it's done, she'll be free?</b>

07:22.380 --> 07:24.660
<b>Situation normal down here.</b>

07:24.660 --> 07:27.660
<b>Only Level A authorized personnel 
are getting in or out.</b>

07:32.200 --> 07:33.090
<b>Copy.</b>

07:56.930 --> 07:57.950
<b>All clear.</b>

09:14.340 --> 09:16.640
<b>I want every available 
guard at their station.</b>

09:17.810 --> 09:18.700
<b>What?</b>

09:19.100 --> 09:20.580
<b>What's wrong with that monitor?</b>

09:21.300 --> 09:22.570
<b>Tell me where that camera is!</b>

09:23.770 --> 09:25.030
<b>A freight elevator.</b>

09:25.030 --> 09:25.950
<b>Number 44, sir.</b>

09:26.300 --> 09:27.440
<b>There's no response.</b>

09:28.530 --> 09:30.940
<b>Shit!
Potential security breach.</b>

09:30.940 --> 09:33.110
<b>Repeat--
potential security breach.</b>

09:33.110 --> 09:35.390
<b>Lock down all doors and elevators.</b>

09:35.790 --> 09:39.360
<b><i>The tower may have been compromised, 
but we have an approximate fix on the intruder's location.</i></b>

09:39.950 --> 09:42.580
<b><i>We'll have security closing in 
on her position in moments, sir.</i></b>

09:43.870 --> 09:45.860
<b>Send your men upstairs immediately!</b>

09:45.860 --> 09:47.450
<b>Get me out of here!</b>

09:47.450 --> 09:51.090
<b><i>It's too dangerous, sir.
Stay in your room, it'll be safer.</i></b>

09:59.590 --> 10:00.600
<b>Lock it down!</b>

10:00.600 --> 10:02.520
<b>Nobody gets in here!</b>

11:19.740 --> 11:20.690
<b>There!</b>

11:48.550 --> 11:49.370
<b>Ah!</b>

11:57.510 --> 11:59.230
<b>Shit. Get out of there!</b>

11:59.600 --> 12:00.860
<b>There she is!</b>

12:40.670 --> 12:42.430
<b><i>We've lost sight of the intruder.</i></b>

12:42.430 --> 12:46.590
<b><i>The main server room's on fire, 
and she was last seen headed towards the aviary.</i></b>

12:47.030 --> 12:48.340
<b>The aviary?</b>

12:48.950 --> 12:50.390
<b>Reroute!</b>

12:51.160 --> 12:53.430
<b>It's not gonna be easy getting her, in there.</b>

13:00.330 --> 13:01.600
<b>What's this?</b>

13:49.480 --> 13:51.950
<b>Had a hunch you were causing all the trouble.</b>

13:58.410 --> 13:59.270
<b>Damn it.</b>

14:26.430 --> 14:28.850
<b>You got spirit, Black Lotus.</b>

14:30.570 --> 14:33.270
<b>Fire in that fake heart of yours.</b>

14:38.590 --> 14:40.350
<b>You've definitely got that.</b>

14:40.940 --> 14:44.080
<b>But everyone has an expiration date.</b>

15:22.400 --> 15:23.240
<b>Ugh!</b>

15:25.220 --> 15:28.230
<b>You put up a real fight, for a skinjob.</b>

16:04.280 --> 16:05.760
<b>Did you find her?</b>

16:05.760 --> 16:07.320
<b>What's the holdup?</b>

16:10.390 --> 16:12.860
<b>All agents, head to the penthouse.</b>

16:12.860 --> 16:13.860
<b>Now!</b>

16:42.510 --> 16:43.510
<b>Welcome,</b>

16:43.760 --> 16:45.790
<b>Niander Wallace Jr.</b>

17:36.990 --> 17:38.290
<b>Poor...</b>

17:38.290 --> 17:39.640
<b>misguided...</b>

17:39.640 --> 17:41.060
<b>defect!</b>

17:54.970 --> 17:56.510
<b>Look at you.</b>

17:57.290 --> 17:59.140
<b>I had such high hopes.</b>

18:00.430 --> 18:04.560
<b>All of the others from the 
desert test worked perfectly.</b>

18:06.810 --> 18:08.060
<b>Why?</b>

18:08.060 --> 18:09.590
<b>Why did you do that to us?</b>

18:10.370 --> 18:11.780
<b>To me?</b>

18:14.590 --> 18:18.160
<b>Your kind were supposed to be obedient.</b>

18:18.160 --> 18:21.240
<b>Instead, you tried to exert free will.</b>

18:21.780 --> 18:24.830
<b>You only have the appearance of freedom.</b>

18:25.390 --> 18:28.140
<b>Everything is an illusion.</b>

18:28.550 --> 18:29.790
<b>Choice?</b>

18:29.790 --> 18:31.430
<b>You have none.</b>

18:31.920 --> 18:33.660
<b>Do you think anyone,</b>

18:33.660 --> 18:38.300
<b>the people on the streets or 
toiling out in space, have choice?</b>

18:39.150 --> 18:40.970
<b>You're just a bug.</b>

18:42.510 --> 18:45.600
<b>Replicants don't matter.</b>

18:46.460 --> 18:47.840
<b>They never have.</b>

18:50.440 --> 18:52.230
<b>We feel pain</b>

18:52.800 --> 18:55.010
<b>as much as any human can.</b>

18:57.780 --> 18:59.280
<b>Good.</b>

20:01.340 --> 20:02.970
<b>The code isn't working.</b>

20:02.970 --> 20:04.340
<b>Someone's already inside.</b>

20:07.110 --> 20:08.340
<b>Override it!</b>

20:17.860 --> 20:20.110
<b>It's over.</b>

20:36.130 --> 20:37.380
