12:49.378 --> 12:52.273
scan to confirm, but you're
hemorrhaging inside,

12:52.480 --> 12:54.286
which means our first priority right now

12:54.311 --> 12:55.578
is to get you to surgery.

12:55.603 --> 12:57.483
How Jules is gonna find me?

12:57.508 --> 12:59.944
Look, if she's here, our support
staff are gonna find her

12:59.969 --> 13:01.301
and they're gonna tell
her where you are,

13:01.326 --> 13:02.566
I'll ask them to myself.

13:02.591 --> 13:03.820
But for now, I really need you

13:03.845 --> 13:05.619
to stay as still as possible. Okay?

13:11.998 --> 13:13.332
Miss Petrakis.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.490
(GASPS) Gabby.

13:19.115 --> 13:20.389
What happened?

13:20.414 --> 13:23.216
Gabby suffered a traumatic impact,

13:23.652 --> 13:25.621
and she went into cardiac arrest.

13:25.809 --> 13:27.475
Her heart stopped?

13:27.613 --> 13:29.881
Yes. But we restarted it,

13:30.010 --> 13:33.355
and we're hoping to rule out any
possible brain damage, but...

13:33.380 --> 13:34.898
Brain damage?

13:34.923 --> 13:37.158
Can you do anything to help her?

13:37.359 --> 13:40.549
We're cooling down her system in order
to decrease her brain function,

13:40.574 --> 13:43.198
so the lack of oxygen is less damaging.

13:43.769 --> 13:46.011
After enough time, we
can warm her back up,

13:46.036 --> 13:49.287
and her brain will reset
itself to normal functioning.

13:49.312 --> 13:51.873
When will we know if she's okay?

13:52.946 --> 13:55.044
Not until she wakes up.

13:56.266 --> 13:58.047
But she will...

13:58.790 --> 14:00.508
wake up?

14:06.656 --> 14:09.141
Julia Burrenski, 33 years old,

14:09.252 --> 14:11.787
open tip fib fractured, lost
a lot of blood on the scene,

14:11.812 --> 14:13.394
possible smoke inhalation. GCS 15.

14:13.419 --> 14:16.607
Okay. We've got this.
Welcome back, Dr. Hamed.

14:19.970 --> 14:21.861
Bash?

14:23.201 --> 14:24.667
Are you okay?

14:24.692 --> 14:26.548
Yeah. What? Am I okay? Are you?

14:26.573 --> 14:28.595
What were you thinking? You
could have been killed.

14:28.620 --> 14:29.687
You can't just...

14:29.712 --> 14:31.580
Show up and volunteer as a doctor?

14:31.765 --> 14:34.082
- You gave blood?
- Yeah. At the scene.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.472
Let me check you out.

14:35.497 --> 14:36.824
No. This place is overflowing

14:36.849 --> 14:38.701
and I see one of my
patients from the building.

14:38.726 --> 14:40.630
I need to make sure he's okay.

14:41.669 --> 14:42.870
You made it.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.690
Because of you. You found help.

14:44.715 --> 14:46.949
- Julia?
- She made it too.

14:47.066 --> 14:48.734
Gav. Has anyone looked at you?

14:48.759 --> 14:49.995
Just some bruised ribs.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.731
Nothing I haven't done mountain biking.

14:51.756 --> 14:54.130
Do buildings usually fall on you
when you are mountain biking.

14:54.155 --> 14:57.176
- (LAUGHS)
- Breathe for me, okay?

14:57.986 --> 14:59.746
(GRUNTS)

15:05.834 --> 15:08.012
You said you were blown
back during the blast?

15:08.037 --> 15:10.614
Yeah. I think maybe I
slammed into the wall.

15:10.723 --> 15:12.169
Gavin, why didn't you tell anyone?

15:12.218 --> 15:13.497
Julia needed you more.

15:13.522 --> 15:14.789
Dr. Curtis?

15:14.814 --> 15:16.912
No. Honestly, guys, you got
bigger problems than...

15:16.937 --> 15:20.036
Gavin. You did your part
to help, let us do ours.

15:20.090 --> 15:21.833
- What do we have?
- Impact trauma.

15:21.858 --> 15:23.424
Tell me what you hear.

15:29.494 --> 15:31.390
Bowel sounds...

15:31.573 --> 15:33.392
Reduced air entry.

15:35.703 --> 15:37.153
The porters are all backed up.

15:37.178 --> 15:39.067
So I'm going to take you
up to surgery myself.

15:39.092 --> 15:41.733
- Did you find Julia?
- Not yet.

15:43.106 --> 15:45.320
It doesn't mean she's not here.

15:50.887 --> 15:52.887
Won't be long.

15:56.087 --> 15:57.540
Careful.

16:12.689 --> 16:14.599
You think this is bad mountain biking?

16:14.624 --> 16:16.518
Oh, not even close.

16:18.521 --> 16:20.396
Let's have a look.

16:21.990 --> 16:23.900
(GRUNT)

16:25.503 --> 16:27.612
There it is. Free fluid.

16:31.003 --> 16:32.492
Dr. Hamed?

16:33.040 --> 16:35.871
Do you see the disruption
at the left diaphragm?

16:36.630 --> 16:38.411
Is that the bowel?

16:38.436 --> 16:41.205
Stomach, I think, I'm just... (GRUNTS)

16:41.230 --> 16:43.128
We'll need a CT to confirm.

16:43.153 --> 16:44.954
Anyone want to explain?

16:45.529 --> 16:48.329
You may have torn your diaphragm
when you were blown backwards.

16:48.354 --> 16:50.616
These type of tears can
cause your abdominal organs

16:50.641 --> 16:52.609
to protrude into your chest cavity.

16:52.634 --> 16:54.471
If so, you will need surgery,

16:54.496 --> 16:57.559
but finding it early
means it's treatable.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.168
Good catch, Dr. Hamed.

17:01.329 --> 17:02.930
I'll get him to CT.

17:03.841 --> 17:06.509
Um, Dr. Curtis will take
care of you from here.

17:06.534 --> 17:08.377
Thank you for everything.

17:13.728 --> 17:15.910

18:11.909 --> 18:14.302
<i>(ECHOING): Dr. Hamed.</i>

18:16.854 --> 18:19.643
Dr. Hamed! Are you with us?

18:19.846 --> 18:21.550
I heard you gave blood
at the scene today.

18:21.575 --> 18:23.937
There were chemicals in that explosion.

18:24.661 --> 18:26.295
We need to take care of those.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.276
Anyone who was in there
could be exposed.

18:38.260 --> 18:39.705
What was that?

18:39.776 --> 18:42.461
Uh, it's... Power grid kicking in.

18:42.486 --> 18:45.159
We've been on generator
since the explosion.

18:48.427 --> 18:51.042
The elevator should start
up again in a second.

18:51.686 --> 18:53.260
Why isn't it?

18:53.378 --> 18:55.094
I don't know.

18:57.373 --> 18:59.180
(GRUNTS)

18:59.967 --> 19:01.534
Naomi? Where does it hurt?

19:01.559 --> 19:02.759
My neck.

19:02.816 --> 19:04.531
Can you describe it for me?

19:04.556 --> 19:06.924
It's tightening. Almost
like I'm being choked.

19:07.031 --> 19:08.651
(CHOKING) - Okay.

19:08.676 --> 19:10.210
We saw the hematoma earlier,

19:10.235 --> 19:12.279
but I do see increased
swelling right now.

19:12.304 --> 19:14.238
Likely residual effect
from impact trauma.

19:14.263 --> 19:15.666
What do we do?

19:15.691 --> 19:17.400
You're gonna be fine. Okay?

19:17.425 --> 19:20.661
(MOANING)

19:21.917 --> 19:23.580
You're sure the burns are chemical?

19:23.733 --> 19:26.408
It must have been something I
touched during the explosion,

19:26.433 --> 19:27.846
maybe even one of the patients

19:27.871 --> 19:29.510
had that substance on their skin.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.225
And you didn't notice till now?

19:31.250 --> 19:33.518
There are a number of corrosives
that don't take effect

19:33.543 --> 19:35.409
until much after contact.

19:35.434 --> 19:37.900
The timeline varies
depending on the chemical.

19:38.186 --> 19:41.268
So there's no telling who
or what you touched.

19:42.841 --> 19:45.184
You've seen this kind of burns before?

19:46.615 --> 19:49.482
Regime chemical attacks were frequent.

19:49.507 --> 19:50.995
Sometimes people would be exposed

19:51.020 --> 19:52.776
and not know it at first.

19:55.377 --> 19:58.208
You need to monitor every
patient from the explosion

19:58.233 --> 19:59.900
to make sure they haven't been affected.

20:00.226 --> 20:02.730
We will. But that includes you.

20:02.755 --> 20:04.089
Sir, I'm fine.

20:04.114 --> 20:06.541
My burns are minor. They
still need to be treated.

20:06.566 --> 20:08.834
So do the people who
might have been exposed.

20:08.914 --> 20:10.376
We're busy. They need my help.

20:10.401 --> 20:12.035
And they will get it.

20:12.867 --> 20:15.463
As soon as you finish
irrigating your burns

20:15.488 --> 20:17.314
and do a pH assessment.

20:17.648 --> 20:19.762
Understood? Good.

20:19.917 --> 20:21.429
I'll send a nurse?

20:29.982 --> 20:32.784
Is there anyone else presenting
with chemical burns?

20:32.809 --> 20:35.096
We've been screening, so far nothing.

20:35.121 --> 20:38.196
Triage knows to alert us
if they see any signs.

20:38.565 --> 20:40.088
How's Bash?

20:40.113 --> 20:42.868
His burns are minor and
we caught them in time.

20:43.862 --> 20:45.242
You're worried about him?

20:45.267 --> 20:47.122
He's seen chemicals like this before,

20:47.147 --> 20:48.832
during the war.

20:49.300 --> 20:50.581
Dr. Bishop.

20:50.606 --> 20:52.628
We've got a problem with
one of the elevators.

20:52.653 --> 20:53.986
Have you called Mechanical?

20:54.011 --> 20:56.214
Yes, but I think you
need to come with me.

21:02.623 --> 21:04.757
Hi. Can I help you?

21:04.945 --> 21:06.934
I still can't find my boyfriend.

21:06.959 --> 21:08.759
Did you check with triage?

21:08.784 --> 21:10.720
They have the most updated
list from the explosion.

21:10.745 --> 21:12.279
Yeah, I tried to tell the other nurse.

21:12.304 --> 21:14.716
- He wasn't in the explosion.
- Okay.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.993
- Tell me what happened.
- Uhm...

21:17.605 --> 21:20.948
The paramedics brought
him here because he...

21:21.254 --> 21:23.993
He OD'd. And I gave him naloxone,

21:24.018 --> 21:26.306
but I think that maybe it was too late.

21:26.331 --> 21:28.415
And no one is telling me anything so...

21:28.440 --> 21:29.872
What's your boyfriend's name?

21:29.897 --> 21:31.416
Chris Hewitt.

21:31.663 --> 21:32.876
And yours?

21:33.275 --> 21:34.542
Alexia.

21:34.567 --> 21:36.501
Alexia. My name is Claire.

21:36.534 --> 21:38.334
I'm going to figure out
what happened to him.

21:38.359 --> 21:41.128
That's what the other guy
said and it's been forever.

21:41.153 --> 21:43.254
It has been a bit of a
madhouse here today.

21:43.279 --> 21:45.027
And it might take me a bit of time,

21:45.052 --> 21:46.720
but I promise I'll find him, okay?

21:46.745 --> 21:48.485
Just have a seat over here and wait.

21:48.510 --> 21:50.560
Sure you will.

21:53.930 --> 21:55.751
I was prepping him for surgery

21:55.776 --> 21:56.954
when his burns started to develop.

21:56.979 --> 21:58.392
Gavin, you said you
were in the bike shop

21:58.417 --> 21:59.684
when the blast happened?

21:59.709 --> 22:01.488
It felt like the explosion
was right under us.

22:01.513 --> 22:03.312
What sort of chemicals do you use there?

22:03.337 --> 22:05.275
Lots of stuff.

22:05.300 --> 22:08.185
Degreaser, mineral
spirits, rust remover...

22:08.210 --> 22:10.955
- Rust remover?
- Yeah. We use it all the time.

22:10.980 --> 22:14.651
Hydrofluoric acid. It's used to
strip rust, among other things.

22:14.676 --> 22:16.109
It can take some time to present.

22:16.134 --> 22:18.790
It's easily neutralized with a
solution of calcium gluconate.

22:18.815 --> 22:20.243
If it was localized to the shop

22:20.268 --> 22:22.402
that will explain why we
havenâ€™t see more burns.

22:22.427 --> 22:24.191
I wasn't there alone, Dr. Hamed.

22:25.017 --> 22:27.014
Excuse me.

22:29.044 --> 22:30.744
This just came on now?

22:30.866 --> 22:32.477
When I woke up.

22:32.831 --> 22:34.604
(GRUNTING)

22:34.629 --> 22:37.236
You must have been in closer
proximity than Gavin.

22:37.261 --> 22:39.693
It's in my lungs?

22:40.579 --> 22:43.571
(COUGHING)

22:47.269 --> 22:49.202
Aerosolized particles.

22:49.924 --> 22:52.241
We can do a procedure
called a lung lavage.

22:52.266 --> 22:54.283
It flushes out the
chemicals from your lungs.

22:54.308 --> 22:56.276
(WHEEZING)

22:56.301 --> 22:58.269
Take slow breaths for me.

22:58.386 --> 23:00.073
(WHEEZING)

23:00.345 --> 23:03.341
It's an internal hematoma which
is now swelling quickly.

23:03.366 --> 23:06.011
A blast injury? Arterial?

23:06.036 --> 23:07.351
<i>A venous collection.</i>

23:07.376 --> 23:09.931
And it aggravated when
the elevator stopped.

23:10.228 --> 23:13.586
Dr. Bishop, if it's
pressing on her airway...

23:17.875 --> 23:19.523
(GASPS)

23:19.735 --> 23:21.502
<i>How long until somebody can get us out?</i>

23:21.579 --> 23:23.022
When the power came back on,

23:23.047 --> 23:25.515
the surge blew part of our grid.

23:25.540 --> 23:26.789
We've got two elevators down,

23:26.814 --> 23:28.381
but only yours was in use at the time.

23:28.406 --> 23:30.390
Mechanical's working
with fire and rescue,

23:30.415 --> 23:34.039
but you're between floors,
so it's delicate.

23:35.678 --> 23:37.906
Sir, if the swelling continues

23:37.931 --> 23:39.867
we lose our shot at intubating her.

23:39.892 --> 23:43.461
You need to be prepared to
act before that happens.

23:43.487 --> 23:46.801
<i>You mean, open an
airway without imaging?</i>

23:47.915 --> 23:50.218
Sir, even if I could
approximate an incision point,

23:50.243 --> 23:51.515
I don't have the proper tools.

23:51.540 --> 23:53.031
Well, let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.828
How fast is the swelling accelerating?

23:54.853 --> 23:56.484
It's doubled in the last nine minutes.

23:56.509 --> 23:58.320
Well, if it keeps accelerating
at the same rate,

23:58.345 --> 24:00.357
you won't have another nine minutes.

24:02.771 --> 24:04.471
(GASPS)

24:04.496 --> 24:06.111
If I don't make it,

24:06.136 --> 24:08.906
I need you to tell Jules...

24:09.502 --> 24:13.232
If I knew this morning was
gonna be the last time...

24:13.962 --> 24:17.581
Please, tell her that I love her.

24:17.606 --> 24:19.874
- No.
- What?

24:19.899 --> 24:21.633
I'm not gonna tell your
wife you love her.

24:21.658 --> 24:22.963
Because you will.

24:23.042 --> 24:24.509
You will.

24:24.534 --> 24:25.875
Do we have an ETA on doctor Singh?

24:25.900 --> 24:27.593
He's on OR4 with a thoracotomy.

24:27.618 --> 24:29.886
He's going to be out for
at least ten more minutes.

24:29.911 --> 24:31.085
Who else is on?

24:31.110 --> 24:33.397
All the ORs are active right now.
We're it.

24:33.422 --> 24:34.555
He's getting worse.

24:34.580 --> 24:36.405
We're losing circulation
to the herniated bowel.

24:36.430 --> 24:37.730
We're gonna have to go in.

24:37.755 --> 24:39.823
Without Singh? Dr. Curtis...

24:39.848 --> 24:42.389
If we lose blood flow, the
bowel will become ischemic.

24:42.635 --> 24:45.360
It could cause severe damage.
I have to go in.

24:46.260 --> 24:48.237
Scalpel.

25:04.461 --> 25:05.828
Please.

25:07.141 --> 25:08.491
May I?

25:13.536 --> 25:16.860
So we're slowly bringing your
daughter's temperature back up.

25:16.981 --> 25:18.368
I can't stand this.

25:18.393 --> 25:19.967
Not knowing.

25:21.122 --> 25:23.287
It shouldn't be too much longer now.

25:23.926 --> 25:25.927
There must be something you can tell me.

25:25.952 --> 25:27.154
Chances? Statistics?

25:27.179 --> 25:29.487
I can't just sit here in the dark.

25:32.644 --> 25:35.451
Gabby walks home from school on her own.

25:36.192 --> 25:39.914
If I'd finished work early
and come to pick her up...

25:39.961 --> 25:41.396
Elena...

25:42.707 --> 25:44.710
This is not your fault.

25:45.293 --> 25:47.593
I had the option to work
from home this year

25:47.618 --> 25:49.215
and I didn't take it.

25:50.066 --> 25:51.802
And if you did pick her up?

25:52.714 --> 25:54.970
You could both be lying here.

25:57.936 --> 26:00.310
I'm never letting her walk home again.

26:02.942 --> 26:06.211
I bet you Gabby wouldn't be as
keen on that idea as you are.

26:06.244 --> 26:08.623
(LAUGHS)

26:09.285 --> 26:11.904
She's always been so stubborn.

26:13.643 --> 26:16.678
I'll come get you as soon
as there's news. Okay?

26:17.455 --> 26:18.954
Thank you.

26:36.163 --> 26:39.833
All I need to do is make
an incision distally.

26:40.065 --> 26:42.240
I'll quickly insert a tube.

26:42.265 --> 26:43.373
Dr. Leblanc.

26:43.398 --> 26:45.348
<i>Poor hemostatic technique
can increase the risk...</i>

26:45.373 --> 26:46.463

26:46.488 --> 26:48.170
<i>To be careful to apply pressure...</i>

26:48.195 --> 26:50.526
- Mags!
- What?

26:50.551 --> 26:53.310
(BISHOP): Where do you spend
every waking moment of your day?

26:53.662 --> 26:55.138
In this hospital?

26:55.163 --> 26:57.700
Exactly. And when you're not
here, what are you doing?

26:57.725 --> 26:58.925
Reading.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.553
<i>Reading what?</i>

27:01.937 --> 27:03.372

27:03.546 --> 27:05.847
<i>I've read three studies
on this procedure</i>

27:05.872 --> 27:08.294
and I've watched every
video available online.

27:10.027 --> 27:13.105
You're the one always telling me not
to overthink, but I'm ready for this

27:13.130 --> 27:15.323
<i>because... because of
all the work I've done.</i>

27:15.348 --> 27:16.615
I agree.

27:16.640 --> 27:17.873
You do?

27:18.411 --> 27:21.206
If I was stuck in an
elevator <i>with a hematoma,</i>

27:21.231 --> 27:23.685
no imaging, and no tools,

27:24.639 --> 27:26.897
I'd be lucky to have you
there to handle it.

27:32.674 --> 27:34.404
I'm gonna do it now.

27:34.429 --> 27:36.615

28:46.353 --> 28:48.054
Did you find him?

28:48.368 --> 28:50.730
Is Chris okay? Is he...

28:51.679 --> 28:53.580
Do you mind coming with me?

28:54.794 --> 28:56.652
No. If he's, uh...

28:58.605 --> 29:01.939
If this is what I think,
please just tell me here.

29:01.964 --> 29:03.916
I am so sorry to tell you,

29:03.941 --> 29:06.516
but the doctors weren't
able to save Chris's life.

29:06.541 --> 29:09.423
(CRYING) He died from the overdose.

29:11.557 --> 29:13.494
I tried to help him. I did.

29:13.519 --> 29:14.884
I spoke with the paramedics

29:14.909 --> 29:16.462
and they said the exact same thing.

29:16.487 --> 29:18.422
You did everything you could.

29:20.643 --> 29:23.345
Is there anyone I can
call to be here with you?

29:24.365 --> 29:26.100
No, there's, uh...

29:26.876 --> 29:28.684
There's no one.

29:29.651 --> 29:31.369
I know how hard this must be.

29:31.394 --> 29:33.564
Do you? Really?

29:34.189 --> 29:37.915
The only person who ever gave
a crap about me is dead.

29:43.300 --> 29:46.535
(CRYING)

29:52.837 --> 29:54.271
You started without me?

29:54.296 --> 29:56.236
The patient's stomach was
halfway into his chest cavity

29:56.261 --> 29:58.420
and beginning to necrotize.
I had no choice.

29:58.445 --> 30:00.533
Let me take a look at what you've done.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.723
You were able to re-assemble
the edges without tension.

30:06.748 --> 30:08.861
Yeah. I used running silk

30:08.886 --> 30:11.587
and interrupted reinforcement
sutures along with some mesh.

30:11.886 --> 30:13.687
You can close up.

30:18.604 --> 30:20.862
Lung isolation established.

30:20.969 --> 30:24.405
You fully evaluated potential
morbidity from the procedure?

30:24.430 --> 30:25.930
No risk for complications.

30:25.955 --> 30:27.716
We don't tape the joints.

30:27.741 --> 30:29.008
They can leak.

30:29.033 --> 30:31.052
We did a lot of these in
the field during the war.

30:31.077 --> 30:32.877
Did you check for
effective lung isolation?

30:32.902 --> 30:34.195
One lung needs to be ventilated

30:34.220 --> 30:36.126
while the other is being flushed.

30:37.539 --> 30:39.173
Clamp the drainage tube,

30:39.198 --> 30:41.710
and introduce 1200 mL of lavage fluid.

30:41.735 --> 30:43.632
Yes, sir.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.680

32:52.965 --> 32:54.252
I'll do it.

Gabby?

33:42.769 --> 33:44.439
Do you know where you are?

33:45.270 --> 33:47.151
It's okay, baby.

33:47.176 --> 33:48.625
You're in the hospital.

Hi, I'm Theo.

33:52.271 --> 33:55.075
Gabby, I'm gonna ask
you something, okay?

33:56.046 --> 33:58.859
Can you count backwards from ten for me?

34:01.035 --> 34:04.585
Why... backwards?

34:05.307 --> 34:07.588
That's a very good sign.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.466
Your mother told me you
had a mind of your own.

take over the aspiration.

34:31.454 --> 34:34.114
You said you did those
procedures in the war.

34:34.648 --> 34:37.266
It's understandable if
this one got to you,

34:37.291 --> 34:39.391
given the events of the day.

34:39.417 --> 34:41.996
It didn't. I hesitated. That's all.

34:42.091 --> 34:43.224

34:43.378 --> 34:45.942
I think we both know
it was more than that.

35:00.103 --> 35:02.961
You pull something like that
again, you're off my team.

35:02.986 --> 35:04.593
If I didn't intervene when I did,

35:04.618 --> 35:06.772
the patient would be on a feeding
tube for the rest of his life.

35:06.797 --> 35:09.040
I was minutes away. You
should have waited...

35:09.065 --> 35:11.149
You would be saying the same
thing if I was Dr. Miller?

35:11.321 --> 35:14.024
You think I'm giving you a hard time

35:14.049 --> 35:15.948
because you're a woman?

35:16.799 --> 35:18.755
When I started here 25 years ago,

35:18.780 --> 35:21.267
I was the only brown
face in the department.

35:21.354 --> 35:23.722
I guess you found a way to
pay that prejudice forward.

35:23.908 --> 35:26.587
If that's what you want to believe Dr.
Curtis, fine.

35:26.899 --> 35:29.353
But the truth is, you shouldn't
perform that procedure alone

35:29.378 --> 35:31.673
for the same reason I didn't want Dr.
Miller

35:31.698 --> 35:34.282
to go ahead and divide that
cystic artery this morning,

35:34.307 --> 35:36.241

35:36.660 --> 35:38.394
Because you're not ready.

35:38.419 --> 35:39.993
A patient's gonna live a normal life

35:40.018 --> 35:41.142
because of what I did in there.

35:41.167 --> 35:43.634
Your execution was sloppy.

35:44.160 --> 35:46.103
You cut wider than necessary

35:46.128 --> 35:48.610
and you used twice the
mesh that you needed.

35:48.874 --> 35:51.149
He'll have a harder
recovery because of it.

35:51.723 --> 35:53.985
This isn't about your gender,

35:54.010 --> 35:55.954
or your sense of entitlement

35:55.979 --> 35:58.180
or the massive chip on your shoulder.

35:59.854 --> 36:01.888
It's about the patients.

36:03.458 --> 36:05.696
Consider that next time before you cut.

Oh my God, that's her.

39:55.214 --> 39:56.447
Hey.

39:58.973 --> 40:00.173
Hey.

40:10.997 --> 40:14.111
There's a Gift card for the
grocery store down the street.

40:14.136 --> 40:16.206
They have hot meals too.

40:18.307 --> 40:21.225
There's also the name and
address of a woman's shelter.

40:21.669 --> 40:24.005
Our social worker called ahead,

40:24.154 --> 40:25.954
they have a bed waiting for you.

40:27.514 --> 40:29.515
All you have to do is show up.

40:35.417 --> 40:37.519
Why are you doing this?

40:38.505 --> 40:40.856
I ran away when I was fifteen.

40:41.868 --> 40:44.108
It's never too late to start again.

40:47.697 --> 40:50.199
(SIGHS) I'm here most days.

40:51.135 --> 40:53.660
You need anything, you come back.

41:20.107 --> 41:22.726
I bet you do something
like this every day

41:22.751 --> 41:24.517
and no one ever notices.

41:24.624 --> 41:28.070
Look at you, so sentimental today.

41:28.178 --> 41:30.179
(CHUCKLING)

41:46.205 --> 41:47.882
How are you feeling, Gavin?

41:48.263 --> 41:50.174
I talked to the nurses.

41:52.869 --> 41:55.389
Four people died in that explosion.

41:55.830 --> 41:58.267
I was there. You did
everything you could.

42:00.303 --> 42:03.771
Those people that didn't
make it, you have to...

42:05.374 --> 42:07.568
You have to try and let that go.

42:11.171 --> 42:12.753
Yeah.

42:24.863 --> 42:27.565
(MUFFLED GUNFIRE)

42:27.805 --> 42:30.807
(BEEPING)
