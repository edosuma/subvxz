WEBVTT

00:01.767 --> 00:05.840
<i>I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

00:05.887 --> 00:09.323
<i>And I'm so hot</i>

00:09.367 --> 00:13.883
<i>Cos I'm in hell</i>

00:19.847 --> 00:20.962
 That smells good.

00:21.007 --> 00:23.282
Is that a Cumberland sausage?

00:23.327 --> 00:26.205
It's my birthday week
so I'm being nice to myself.

00:26.247 --> 00:28.442
That's an onion gravy, isn't it?

00:28.487 --> 00:32.036
I thought I'd throw a party
and in advance of the party

00:32.087 --> 00:33.600
I'm going to go speed dating.

00:33.647 --> 00:35.922
It'd be great to get a date lined up.

00:35.967 --> 00:37.844
Speed dating? And a party?

00:37.887 --> 00:40.242
Mark, you know that if
you end up a basket case,

00:40.287 --> 00:43.723
I'm the one who'll have to wheel you
around the National Army Museum.

00:43.767 --> 00:47.840
Look at us, Jez, we're letting
our lives slip through our fingers.

00:47.887 --> 00:50.196
Maybe you don't care,
but I need to get out there

00:50.247 --> 00:52.807
and I'm never going to meet a woman
in a pub or a nightclub

00:52.847 --> 00:56.726
or an art gallery or a book shop, or any
other formal or informal social gathering.

00:56.767 --> 00:58.280
It's just not going to happen.

00:58.327 --> 01:00.397
D'you think you're going
to eat all that?

01:00.447 --> 01:02.085
I don't know. It's a bit too much

01:02.127 --> 01:05.084
but I'm hoping if I eat it quickly,
my stomach won't notice.

01:06.807 --> 01:08.240
I'm hungry.

01:08.287 --> 01:10.881
That is not my problem.

01:12.967 --> 01:15.561
'I'm the skinny one,
I need food more than him.

01:15.607 --> 01:18.360
'Yeah, I might just Robin Hood
this baby.

01:18.407 --> 01:22.525
'He's such a tightarse, won't even replace
the wide screen.

01:22.567 --> 01:25.525
'How are they supposed to
brainwash me with their adverts

01:25.567 --> 01:27.444
'if I can't even see them properly? '

01:27.487 --> 01:28.761
Recognise this, Jeremy?

01:28.807 --> 01:31.765
I went to get the Cherry Garcia out
to defrost

01:31.807 --> 01:33.718
and look what I found inside.

01:33.767 --> 01:35.564
"Look, I know what you think
happened

01:35.607 --> 01:38.326
"and you're right,
I have eaten all your ice-cream. "

01:38.367 --> 01:41.086
This is it, this is the line.
You have crossed the line.

01:41.127 --> 01:43.880
Read the mitigating circumstances.
There are loads.

01:43.927 --> 01:46.202
A sausage has gone!

01:46.247 --> 01:48.283
Oh, my God, Jeremy.

01:48.327 --> 01:51.603
A sausage is missing!
Is this what it's come to?

01:51.647 --> 01:55.276
I've got to carry my food around
with me now, to stop you from...

01:55.327 --> 01:58.239
Right, well, I'm sorry,
you've driven me to this.

01:58.287 --> 01:59.402
 What are you doing?

01:59.447 --> 02:01.915
I'm making a list of
all the household items

02:01.967 --> 02:03.958
that you have permission
to consume.

02:04.007 --> 02:05.486
Oh, for God's sake.

02:05.527 --> 02:08.644
Toilet paper, OK. Soap, OK.
But not shower gel.

02:08.687 --> 02:10.439
And no razors.

02:10.487 --> 02:12.637
If you're poor, grow a beard.

02:12.687 --> 02:14.917
Tea bags are allowed, within limits.

02:14.967 --> 02:16.286
Limits? What limits?

02:16.327 --> 02:18.636
No making a pie out of tea
or anything weird.

02:18.687 --> 02:21.440
Look, Mark, lay off, will you?

02:21.487 --> 02:25.719
The thing is, and I keep...
meaning to tell you this,

02:25.767 --> 02:29.726
but basically a few years ago
Mummy gave me a nest egg

02:29.767 --> 02:32.486
and I kept on meaning to invest,

02:32.527 --> 02:35.485
but it turns out I've spent it.

02:35.527 --> 02:37.006
You ate your nest egg?

02:37.047 --> 02:39.402
You're meant to sit on
your nest egg till it hatches,

02:39.447 --> 02:43.406
not eat it like some
greedy, mad chicken.

02:43.447 --> 02:46.519
Well, the solution's obvious.
Get a job.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.320
Yeah, fine, whatever,
but it's difficult, you know?

02:49.367 --> 02:52.120
There just aren't that many
media positions out there.

02:52.167 --> 02:53.202
That's the reality.

02:53.247 --> 02:55.966
So? Do something else,
get on your bike.

02:56.007 --> 02:59.317
I can't believe you're trying to make me
get a job not in the media.

02:59.367 --> 03:00.880
You're such a bastard.

03:00.927 --> 03:04.078
You have to pay rent,
Jeremy, that needs to happen.

03:06.967 --> 03:09.242
Put the sausage back.
I'm deadly serious.

03:09.287 --> 03:13.803
You never pay any rent. If you start
stealing from me as well, that's it,

03:13.847 --> 03:16.441
you'll have to move out.
This is the final straw.

03:18.127 --> 03:23.155
'Mmm! Delicious Cumberland
final straw, dripping in onion gravy. '

03:24.847 --> 03:28.317
'Ugh, speed dating,
that was horrible.

03:28.367 --> 03:31.165
'No-one else seemed to mind.
Maybe this is the future.

03:31.207 --> 03:34.882
'Three-minute date,
three-minute fuck, three-minute marriage. '

03:34.927 --> 03:36.042
Mark Corrigan.

03:36.087 --> 03:40.239
We've collated all your ticks and crosses
with the girls' ticks and crosses.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.721
The results are in.
What does the swingometer say?

03:42.767 --> 03:45.759
Well, I'm afraid you've
got no matches for dating.

03:45.807 --> 03:49.766
What? None? But number 23
said she was definitely going to tick!

03:49.807 --> 03:51.843
That's a verbal contract!

03:51.887 --> 03:54.037
Well, maybe you could
take her to court.

03:54.087 --> 03:57.284
Speed dating, I'd be
better off speed skating.

03:57.327 --> 04:00.285
'Doesn't really work
but she gets the point.

04:00.327 --> 04:03.842
'I'm just another reject slowly
slipping out of the gene pool

04:03.887 --> 04:06.321
'to get hoovered up
by the sex industry. '

04:08.167 --> 04:12.080
'Oh, Saz, she implied
she might be ticking.

04:12.127 --> 04:16.642
'Maybe she did tick, maybe the data
wasn't collated correctly.

04:16.687 --> 04:19.247
'Maybe she's my hanging chad. '

04:19.286 --> 04:21.517
Hi, remember me?

04:21.567 --> 04:23.239
Um...

04:23.287 --> 04:25.801
Mark, we had a three-minute date
about 15 minutes ago.

04:25.847 --> 04:28.998
Yeah, sorry, sorry,
I'm just a bit all over the place.

04:29.047 --> 04:32.437
I just got a message from this guy
I just split up with. He wants me

04:32.487 --> 04:35.638
to move all my stuff out of his
apartment by the end of the week.

04:35.687 --> 04:37.757
We only just split up on Tuesday.
What a knob.

04:37.807 --> 04:40.241
That's terrible, but... Budvar?

04:40.287 --> 04:42.926
- Yeah, great!
- 'I'm buying her a drink.

04:42.967 --> 04:45.162
'Got to order before
someone nicks my idea. '

04:48.367 --> 04:50.642
'Yeah, I'll get on my bike.

04:50.687 --> 04:52.245
'My bike's my big dick. '

04:52.287 --> 04:53.879
Jeremy Usbourne?

04:53.927 --> 04:55.440
'Wow, she's hot.

04:55.487 --> 04:57.478
'Maybe she's a sort of warm-up act. '

04:57.527 --> 05:00.405
- Cubicle three.
- Great, thanks.

05:00.447 --> 05:02.881
Listen, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.121
What for?

05:04.167 --> 05:06.203
For what goes on through there.

05:06.247 --> 05:08.238
I just want to assure you

05:08.287 --> 05:12.997
that I'm not the same as the rest
of these feckless come-shedders.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.842
So, if you ever need anyone for a...

05:17.887 --> 05:20.845
private donation,
you've got my details.

05:22.207 --> 05:26.678
'Oooh, bit creepy. Spermy atmosphere
is cramping my style.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.764
'Right. Time to open
my sticky bank account. '

05:29.807 --> 05:33.083
'Hey, where's the porn? No porn?

05:33.127 --> 05:35.880
'Am I supposed
to just dry hump myself?

05:35.927 --> 05:39.237
'Must be something I could use?

05:39.287 --> 05:40.800
'Would it be wrong?

05:40.847 --> 05:43.361
'Why not? It's a free country.

05:45.287 --> 05:49.280
'OK, Queeny, it's back in the '50s,
you're nice and young,

05:49.327 --> 05:53.240
'you've just been coronated,
I'm taking off your cloak.

05:53.287 --> 05:55.118
'No, leave the crown on.

05:55.167 --> 05:57.840
'Ooh, what's this, stockings?

05:57.887 --> 06:01.436
'You've been getting through
your nylon ration book pretty quickly,

06:01.487 --> 06:04.001
'you naughty, sexy Queen!

06:04.047 --> 06:06.038
'Oh, shit.

06:06.087 --> 06:07.759
'Right, here we...

06:07.807 --> 06:09.877
'Oh. Elgar?!

06:09.927 --> 06:11.724
'Oh, I've totally lost it now.

06:11.767 --> 06:14.565
'Thanks a bunch, Elgar'

06:16.607 --> 06:19.326
'What's my stuff doing in the hall? '

06:19.367 --> 06:21.722
Jez, I didn't realise
you'd be back so soon.

06:21.767 --> 06:25.123
You're redecorating.
Oh, you felt bad about before.

06:25.167 --> 06:28.557
That's nice. Not sure about that
for the ceiling colour,

06:28.607 --> 06:30.757
but then it's not me that looks
at that - it's the chicks, right?

06:30.807 --> 06:32.286
Right.

06:32.327 --> 06:35.444
The thing is, it's not for you,
mate, it's for Saz.

06:35.487 --> 06:37.443
Sorry? Saz? Saz who?

06:37.487 --> 06:39.523
What Saz?

06:39.567 --> 06:41.239
Hi!

06:41.287 --> 06:44.597
Saz is having that room,
I've invited Saz to move in.

06:44.647 --> 06:46.558
What the fuck? You're kicking me out?

06:46.607 --> 06:51.317
Not right away. You can stay on
the sofa until you find a new place.

06:51.367 --> 06:54.916
It's just not viable for you to
take up a whole room for free.

06:54.967 --> 06:58.926
What? And what do you call this,
exactly?

06:58.967 --> 07:01.481
A loaf of delicious
Vogel linseed bread.

07:04.927 --> 07:08.317
Benecol margarine, soya milk, marrow?

07:08.367 --> 07:12.246
What's wrong with linseed bread and
marzipan and Ryvita and radishes?

07:12.287 --> 07:14.084
It's Continental.

07:14.127 --> 07:17.358
I know why you're buying it,
because you know I don't like it.

07:17.407 --> 07:18.920
But you don't like it either.

07:18.967 --> 07:22.516
If you're going to steal my food,
Jeremy, I prefer you not to enjoy it

07:22.567 --> 07:25.525
and not enjoying it myself
is a small price to pay.

07:25.567 --> 07:27.000
Look, if you had some career

07:27.047 --> 07:30.562
other than wanking into a cup, maybe
you could buy food and pay the rent.

07:30.607 --> 07:34.520
- What's she paying, then?
- Saz? Well, nothing... i-initially.

07:34.567 --> 07:40.039
But, Jeremy, look, the thing is,
I think she might be the one.

07:40.087 --> 07:42.362
And I could never win
with a woman like that

07:42.407 --> 07:46.400
on the sexual battlefield, but
in here, I can pipe in Barry White

07:46.447 --> 07:51.043
while she's asleep, pretend I need
a back rub, fall asleep on her lap.

07:51.087 --> 07:53.521
Right, so that's what it
comes down to, is it?

07:53.567 --> 07:56.798
You don't want to bone me,
so I'm out. It's that brutal.

07:56.847 --> 07:59.600
Have you seen the old man
down by the seamen's mission?

07:59.647 --> 08:03.196
Yes, not very fuckable, is he?
Screw him. That's what it is, isn't it?

08:05.847 --> 08:09.726
'OK, Sophie due over tomorrow
for the break-up handover.

08:09.767 --> 08:12.361
'Nothing too heavy.
Olives, crispbreads, dips.

08:12.407 --> 08:15.240
'These are the heartbreak snacks.

08:15.287 --> 08:17.847
'No stewed ribs
or chocolate dildos. '

08:17.887 --> 08:19.286
You all right, Marco?

08:19.327 --> 08:21.966
Listen, I've just got
a couple of mates around

08:22.007 --> 08:24.157
and we're getting smashed,
is that cool?

08:24.207 --> 08:27.563
Brilliant. I was going to ask if you might
be able to make yourself scarce

08:27.607 --> 08:29.563
tomorrow night.
I've got a bit of ex stuff.

08:29.607 --> 08:32.565
Yeah, whatever.
Hey, listen, Marco,

08:32.607 --> 08:36.077
you wouldn't have any fucking nose powder
on the sly, would you?

08:36.126 --> 08:37.355
No, I don't really...

08:37.407 --> 08:40.126
Why don't you run out
and get us some coke, eh, Marco?

08:40.167 --> 08:43.284
Go on, get us some coke,
you big freak. Then we can sit around

08:43.327 --> 08:46.364
watching your porno collection!

08:46.407 --> 08:49.365
To be honest, I don't really know
where to get coke

08:49.407 --> 08:51.602
and I don't have a porno collection.

08:51.647 --> 08:54.798
Sure you do, you're getting a chubby
just thinking about it,

08:54.847 --> 08:58.726
aren't you, mate?
You filthy little dirt box!

08:58.767 --> 09:01.918
Hey, man, Marco's got a chub on!

09:01.967 --> 09:04.003
LAUGHTER

09:04.647 --> 09:07.115
Come on, girls,
let's get shitfaced.

09:08.247 --> 09:12.001
Wow, this is great, isn't it?
Three fun-loving girls in the flat.

09:12.047 --> 09:13.036
Anything could happen.

09:13.087 --> 09:15.396
I suppose anything could happen.

09:15.447 --> 09:16.323
Anything could happen.

09:16.367 --> 09:17.595
They might shag us.

09:17.647 --> 09:18.796
Don't say it, Jeremy.

09:18.847 --> 09:21.839
- They might shag each other.
- There's no need to actually say it.

09:21.887 --> 09:23.002
If you say it,
you'll break the spell.

09:23.047 --> 09:25.083
- I'll open the tequila.
- Good idea.

09:25.127 --> 09:26.116
DOORBELL

09:26.167 --> 09:29.079
This is probably their dealer.
What shall I say to their dealer?

09:30.807 --> 09:31.796
Soph.

09:31.847 --> 09:33.519
Hey, Mark.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.558
But... The handover's
not till tomorrow night.

09:35.607 --> 09:37.996
I think I would remember, Mark.

09:38.047 --> 09:40.322
No, look, I'll show you in my diary.

09:40.367 --> 09:42.517
See, tomorrow night -
you've got it wrong.

09:42.567 --> 09:47.357
Oh, right. Well done, Mark. One
point to you. Sorry. Can I come in?

09:47.407 --> 09:48.635
No?

09:48.687 --> 09:50.040
What?

09:50.087 --> 09:53.079
Maybe we should stick
to the appointed...

09:53.127 --> 09:55.516
OK, I guess, if... if you're here.

09:58.207 --> 10:01.836
'OK, let's try and keep this
festival of recriminations brief. '

10:01.887 --> 10:05.243
Ignore the girls, they're Jeremy's girls,
they're not my girls.

10:05.287 --> 10:06.276
LAUGHTER

10:06.327 --> 10:09.125
No way! Oh, my God!

10:11.607 --> 10:13.484
Thanks for my stuff.

10:13.527 --> 10:16.678
Here's your stuff. It's so great
that you could come round.

10:16.727 --> 10:17.557
I'll see you in the office, I guess.

10:17.607 --> 10:20.167
I thought the whole point was
we were going to have

10:20.207 --> 10:22.960
a bit of an air clear. Unless of
course this is a bad time for you.

10:23.007 --> 10:24.122
'No, not sitting! '

10:24.167 --> 10:26.556
I don't know if I'm
up or down at the moment.

10:26.607 --> 10:29.201
Tolly from the office
asked if I wanted to go for a coffee

10:29.247 --> 10:31.238
and I told him to get lost.

10:31.287 --> 10:34.085
Then I realised, I've got
to move on at some time, so...

10:34.127 --> 10:37.756
Hey, Mark, get back in here
so Lindsey can jerk you off! 

10:37.807 --> 10:38.796
What?

10:38.847 --> 10:43.204
No-one's going to jerk me off,
Sophie, it's just a stupid joke.

10:43.247 --> 10:44.441
I'm not the one
that's going to jerk you off,

10:44.487 --> 10:47.638
she's the one
that's going to jerk you off!

10:47.687 --> 10:49.006
Please, carry on.

10:49.047 --> 10:50.605
Are you trying to humiliate me?

10:50.647 --> 10:52.478
What? God, no.

10:52.527 --> 10:57.760
Mark, come and put your tongue
up Lindsey's arsehole, it's clean!

10:58.967 --> 11:02.164
Yeah, well you seem to have moved on
pretty fucking quick.

11:02.207 --> 11:03.686
Look, I'm sorry.

11:03.727 --> 11:07.606
They're Australian, they think
it's all fine. I'm so sorry, Soph.

11:07.647 --> 11:10.639
'I don't even want to put
my tongue up anyone's arsehole. '

11:12.887 --> 11:17.517
'Ugh. So little sleep.
Third night in a row.

11:17.567 --> 11:21.003
'I'm living in Animal House. I don't
want to live in Animal House.

11:21.047 --> 11:23.515
'I want to live in
one of the other houses.

11:23.567 --> 11:28.083
'Little House On The Prairie.
Hello, this is more like it.

11:28.127 --> 11:31.915
'Sexy girl at breakfast.
Finally getting my bonus ball. '

11:31.967 --> 11:33.286
Morning.

11:33.327 --> 11:35.761
What's going on, Marco?

11:35.807 --> 11:38.367
I mean, what the fuck am I doing?

11:38.407 --> 11:40.557
Last night I took all this speed

11:40.607 --> 11:45.761
and I copped off with this guy.
I don't even remember his name.

11:45.807 --> 11:47.320
'Oh, shit, I'm out of my depth.

11:47.367 --> 11:50.200
'What do I do? Put the kettle on?

11:50.247 --> 11:52.966
'The sound of the kettle
might drown out her tears. '

11:53.007 --> 11:54.759
...and everything's just fucked!

11:54.807 --> 11:57.162
'This is my very own
anti-drugs commercial. '

11:57.207 --> 11:59.277
I'll get you a tissue.

11:59.327 --> 12:03.206
What the fuck am I doing
in this country anyway?

12:03.247 --> 12:04.600
How are you doing?

12:04.647 --> 12:05.636
Terrible.

12:05.687 --> 12:08.326
I was in the hall
for most of the night.

12:08.367 --> 12:10.676
What's so funny?
That's what I want to know.

12:10.727 --> 12:13.241
I don't know.

12:13.287 --> 12:16.040
I just think they were...
laughing generally.

12:16.087 --> 12:18.965
I don't think they're ever
going to screw us, do you?

12:19.007 --> 12:21.760
No. No, I don't.

12:21.807 --> 12:23.763
When are they going to leave?

12:23.807 --> 12:27.163
I might ask Saz to leave.

12:27.207 --> 12:31.200
I'll get some money, really I will.
I just need to sleep, Mark.

12:31.247 --> 12:34.045
If they don't go, I might have to go.

12:38.567 --> 12:42.276
So, er, Saz, listen,
I've been thinking.

12:42.327 --> 12:46.639
It's been
really great having you here

12:46.687 --> 12:51.203
but now you've done the South,
the London Eye and the Trocadero,

12:51.247 --> 12:53.522
so you probably want
to be heading up North.

12:53.567 --> 12:54.841
Not really.

12:54.887 --> 12:57.196
But there's a Harvey Nichols in Leeds

12:57.247 --> 12:59.841
everyone goes on about as if
that's the answer to something.

12:59.887 --> 13:02.799
Look, don't kick me out, Marco.

13:02.847 --> 13:05.315
There's an Anzac Memorial
in Huddersfield.

13:05.367 --> 13:10.760
The truth is, I've... actually
started to really like you.

13:12.327 --> 13:15.080
You... like me?

13:15.127 --> 13:17.641
Yeah, I... I want to go out with you.

13:18.327 --> 13:20.761
Wow. OK, so,

13:20.807 --> 13:24.846
I could tell people that...
you were my girlfriend?

13:24.887 --> 13:30.280
Well... we might take things slow
to start with, yeah?

13:30.327 --> 13:33.285
Sure, but we could still have fun

13:33.327 --> 13:35.522
and watch, you know, Morse,

13:35.567 --> 13:41.437
and people could see us out together,
like at my birthday party on Friday,

13:41.487 --> 13:44.081
and I could put a photo of us
on Facebook?

13:44.127 --> 13:47.324
Sure, all that stuff.

13:47.367 --> 13:50.120
So, can I... stay?

13:51.327 --> 13:52.680
Course you can stay.

13:52.727 --> 13:57.437
<i>When a man loves a woman...</i>

13:57.487 --> 13:59.796
Maybe this could be our song.

13:59.847 --> 14:02.441
Sure, why the fuck not?

14:02.487 --> 14:04.398
MUSIC LOUDER

14:04.447 --> 14:08.406
'OK, well, money might not
buy you love, but apparently

14:08.447 --> 14:11.678
'a furnished flat can get you
a reasonable simulation. '

14:13.767 --> 14:15.519
So, when's she moving out?

14:15.567 --> 14:18.798
She's actually not moving out
straightaway.

14:18.847 --> 14:22.123
Have you given her a time limit,
cos when you chucked me out,

14:22.167 --> 14:23.919
no time limit, and here I still am.

14:23.967 --> 14:26.322
Yes, well, she's...

14:26.367 --> 14:29.200
she's not moving out, because...

14:29.247 --> 14:32.125
we are now a couple.

14:32.167 --> 14:33.998
We've started a relationship.

14:35.647 --> 14:37.717
In the last two minutes?

14:37.767 --> 14:40.486
You can't put a stopwatch
on the human heart, Jeremy.

14:40.527 --> 14:42.518
Romance just blossomed,
in the kitchen.

14:42.567 --> 14:44.125
What's going on?

14:45.167 --> 14:47.397
She is so doing a number on you.

14:47.447 --> 14:49.802
This is the fucking limit.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.200
I need to get some sleep, Mark.

14:51.247 --> 14:53.522
But Jez, where are you going?

14:53.567 --> 14:57.003
I don't know, Super Hans or
Pedge's houseboat or Big Suze.

14:57.327 --> 14:59.795
Jez, Suze is back with Johnson

14:59.847 --> 15:04.477
and Pedge's houseboat's never going
to be released from Rotterdam.

15:04.527 --> 15:06.961
Sheesh. What a knob.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.565
'Hope he'll be OK.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.518
'I guess we're moving on.

15:10.567 --> 15:15.800
'Yes, it's me and my hired concubine
for a day of sterile conversation

15:15.847 --> 15:17.917
'and sexual frustration.

15:18.967 --> 15:21.845
'Unless I... '

15:21.887 --> 15:23.684
You don't, do you,

15:23.727 --> 15:25.683
fancy a bit?

15:26.847 --> 15:31.045
I'm not... sure. Um, maybe later?

15:32.127 --> 15:34.800
Of course. Later.

15:34.847 --> 15:36.678
So, I'm off to Frankfurt this afternoon.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.525
Now, normally,
I'd appoint a caretaker manager.

15:39.567 --> 15:42.479
'Oh, Johnson, let me count the ways

15:42.527 --> 15:47.317
'how I admire the organisational
and interpersonal skills of thee.

15:48.727 --> 15:50.922
'Right in front of me, nice.

15:50.967 --> 15:54.642
'Reckon Sophie was
almost definitely the one.

15:54.687 --> 15:58.646
'Yep as soon as she's horrible to me,
realise I want her - classic. '

15:58.687 --> 16:02.441
Oh, ah! 'The bloody lever's gone! '

16:02.487 --> 16:06.002
- Lever, get the lever!
- What?

16:06.047 --> 16:07.685
The lever's gone!

16:07.727 --> 16:08.842
Mark, are you OK?

16:08.887 --> 16:11.879
Agh-agh!

16:11.927 --> 16:15.078
Agh! Ah... Ah.

16:15.127 --> 16:18.085
Ah. Oh, wow. Oh, God!

16:18.127 --> 16:23.724
And for his next trick, Mr Corrigan
will slide a 2B pencil up his anus.

16:23.767 --> 16:24.995
LAUGHTER

16:25.047 --> 16:29.006
'Oh, acute social embarrassment
plus intense physical pain.

16:29.047 --> 16:31.197
'I'm really pushing the envelope. '

16:33.247 --> 16:35.397
- Agh.
- You OK, Mark? What happened?

16:35.447 --> 16:38.245
I don't know, I was just
looking at Sophie and then...

16:38.287 --> 16:41.040
Yeah, she could be a bit more subtle,
couldn't she?

16:41.087 --> 16:44.921
- Is she taking Tolly to your birthday?
- Well, I need the numbers, so...

16:46.287 --> 16:50.803
Perhaps it would be better if you left
the self-harming for the weekend, mate.

16:50.847 --> 16:53.361
<i>Jeff's doing a joke
Jeff's doing a joke</i>

16:53.407 --> 16:56.797
<i>Everybody quiet
cos Jeff's doing a joke</i>

16:59.567 --> 17:01.398
Freak.

17:01.447 --> 17:03.005
Nice.

17:03.047 --> 17:07.643
Anyway, about the party, I mean,
Scumpy Pete wanted to go with me

17:07.686 --> 17:12.157
but I thought, if you wanted,
for moral support, we could go together?

17:12.207 --> 17:13.799
Us?

17:13.847 --> 17:17.806
'Oh, got to choose -
nice geeky Dobby

17:17.847 --> 17:21.044
'or Saz, my primetime
newsreader-type girlfriend? '

17:21.087 --> 17:24.079
Dobby, listen, that's lovely,

17:24.127 --> 17:28.405
but the thing is,
I'm going with my... girlfriend.

17:28.446 --> 17:30.324
You've got a girlfriend?

17:30.367 --> 17:32.278
Don't sound so surprised.

17:32.327 --> 17:34.557
OK, well, cool.

17:34.607 --> 17:38.646
'Did the right thing there,
pretty sure.

17:38.687 --> 17:41.838
'Don't listen to your heart.
That's what no-one tells you,

17:41.887 --> 17:43.878
'but that's the real grown-up truth. '

17:45.447 --> 17:49.281
'OK, I'm homeless
and she's got a home, it's a perfect fit. '

17:49.327 --> 17:53.798
Jeremy, you look terrible.
What's going on?

17:53.847 --> 17:57.044
Mark kicked me out so I
don't have anywhere to live right now.

17:57.087 --> 17:59.647
But I'm actually
really enjoying myself.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.723
Oh, Jeremy, you poor thing.

18:01.767 --> 18:06.557
So, listen, I was wondering, depending
on what you're doing, and stuff,

18:06.607 --> 18:09.679
whether or not
I might come and live with you?

18:09.727 --> 18:11.126
You know I'm back with Alan.

18:11.167 --> 18:14.125
Oh, we can get rid of Johnson.
I mean, the guy's a dick, so...

18:14.167 --> 18:18.604
- He takes very good care of me.
- I could take very good care of you.

18:18.647 --> 18:20.478
I'm not a hobo.

18:20.527 --> 18:24.645
Look, Alan's in Frankfurt, but even so,
I really don't think you can stay here.

18:24.687 --> 18:27.997
Listen,
my sister runs this men's refuge.

18:28.047 --> 18:30.561
If you cut yourself,
they'd have to let you in.

18:30.607 --> 18:31.926
Yeah?

18:31.967 --> 18:33.923
Yeah. I'll just get the number.

18:33.967 --> 18:35.878
'God, look at all this stuff.

18:35.927 --> 18:40.762
'Lovely stuff you could steal,
then sell, then eat and...

Just leave my girlfriend's drinks here.
I can give them to my girlfriend later.

Corrigan, nice piece of arm candy
you got there.

20:48.127 --> 20:52.757
- Do you really think she's the one?
- Who knows? She could be the one.

20:52.807 --> 20:55.082
Love moves in mysterious ways.

20:55.127 --> 20:58.119
Whoa, hello,
she's getting jiggy to this one.

20:58.167 --> 21:02.797
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, she loves
this one. This is one of her faves.

21:02.847 --> 21:05.964
Yeah, there, there she goes!
That's... that's Saz.

21:06.007 --> 21:07.838
That is Saz all over.

21:07.887 --> 21:09.240
That is so her.

21:09.287 --> 21:10.845
Are you OK with that?

21:10.887 --> 21:14.516
Oh, hell, yeah, yeah.
She's just having a bit of fun.

21:14.567 --> 21:17.639
She's a minx, isn't she?
This is all a part of our whole thing.

21:17.687 --> 21:22.886
We'll probably go home after this
and just, really, you know...

21:24.327 --> 21:26.522
Have you seen what they're doing?

21:26.567 --> 21:30.321
Yes, I've bloody seen what they're
doing! It's fine, all right? It's cool.

21:30.367 --> 21:35.122
Look, let's have a funny one!
Do you have the Barron Knights?

21:35.167 --> 21:37.283
- Hey, Mark!
- Jeremy?!

21:37.327 --> 21:40.524
- Happy birthday, man.
- What's this?

21:40.567 --> 21:43.479
You're always saying about
taking up the violin,

21:43.527 --> 21:46.837
- so I thought, now's your chance.
- Wow, a violin!

21:46.887 --> 21:48.843
- Hello, Jeremy.
- Johnson!

21:48.887 --> 21:52.004
- What the fuck? You're in Frankfurt.
- Am I?

21:52.047 --> 21:54.083
Well, I hate to contradict you.

21:54.127 --> 21:56.561
How did you afford this, Jeremy?

21:56.607 --> 21:58.598
Something's come through for me.

21:58.647 --> 22:00.558
So, listen, Jeremy, I got a call today

22:00.607 --> 22:04.043
saying that my credit card had been
used to buy various items...

22:04.087 --> 22:05.600
'Oh, shit! '

22:05.647 --> 22:07.319
...including a violin, a Ted Baker suit

22:07.367 --> 22:11.565
and a bass guitar once played by Sir Paul
McCartney from the Hard Rock Cafe.

22:11.607 --> 22:13.757
Yes, naturally.

22:13.807 --> 22:17.277
That's why I was coming to see you,
to let you in on our scam.

22:17.327 --> 22:18.476
'Oh, great'

22:18.527 --> 22:20.006
 Our scam?!
- Yes.

22:20.047 --> 22:25.167
I load up on goodies, you put a call in
saying your card's lost - shazam!

22:25.207 --> 22:28.836
You get your cash back,
plus a little extra, everyone's a winner.

22:28.887 --> 22:30.957
No, it's why my APR is at 16%.

22:31.007 --> 22:34.920
If it wasn't for lowlifes like you, my APR
would probably be only around 12%.

22:34.967 --> 22:38.880
Alan, I'm sorry, but he's not a criminal.
He's just an idiot.

22:38.927 --> 22:41.680
- I'm calling the authorities.
- No, stop!

22:41.727 --> 22:45.037
Alan, I'll pay... I'll pay up for him.

22:46.447 --> 22:47.880
You came that close.

22:47.927 --> 22:49.246
Let's boogie, baby.

22:49.287 --> 22:52.404
Bloody hell, Jeremy,
you can pay me back in instalments.

22:52.447 --> 22:56.963
OK, fine, everyone wins.
I get my suit, you get your violin.

22:57.007 --> 22:58.998
I don't want a fucking violin!

22:59.047 --> 23:02.357
I want to learn the clarinet,
and I can't, and I've already got one.

23:02.407 --> 23:05.444
Well, learn the violin, as well.
Chill out.

23:06.807 --> 23:09.799
And now a special request
for Mark, the birthday boy!

23:11.047 --> 23:12.446
When A Man Loves A Woman

23:12.487 --> 23:14.045
Our tune.

23:14.087 --> 23:16.601
This is our tune.

23:16.647 --> 23:19.207
If you wanna dance with her,
dance with her.

23:19.247 --> 23:22.683
'Yes, I've taken this long enough.

23:22.727 --> 23:25.924
'We have an arrangement.
That's my rallying cry.

23:25.967 --> 23:27.958
'We have an arrangement. '

23:28.007 --> 23:29.963
Do you mind if I cut in?

23:30.007 --> 23:34.717
Um, babe, can you fuck off?
I'm kinda busy.

23:34.767 --> 23:36.837
 Happy birthday, mate!

23:36.887 --> 23:38.366
Nice party.

23:41.567 --> 23:44.877
'This is it - the worst party ever.

23:44.927 --> 23:46.724
'My misery has peaked.

23:48.687 --> 23:52.521
'Oh, no, look at that! It hadn't peaked.

23:52.567 --> 23:55.877
'Oh, and there's more.

23:55.927 --> 23:58.839
'Good, yes. Great.

23:58.887 --> 24:01.037
'This is all just great. '

24:02.687 --> 24:06.839
Maybe we should... if you fancy it?

24:08.407 --> 24:11.399
No, I don't really fancy it.

24:14.927 --> 24:19.079
'That's right, dance...
Dance the night away,

24:19.127 --> 24:21.925
'but you'll pay me back, Jeremy,

24:21.967 --> 24:25.004
'even if you end up dancing in cages
at fetish bars. '

24:31.487 --> 24:33.364
<i>Paranoia, paranoia</i>

24:33.407 --> 24:36.399
<i>Everybody's comin' to get me</i>

24:36.447 --> 24:39.325
<i>Just say you never met me</i>

24:39.367 --> 24:44.521
<i>I'm runnin' underground
with the moles, diggin' holes</i>
