00:01.134 --> 00:03.101
(OPENING THEME PLAYING)

00:26.492 --> 00:29.161
Good afternoon,
wonderful friends.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.829
(SCREAMING)

00:30.831 --> 00:32.964
Starfire, what happened
to your face?

00:32.966 --> 00:35.267
I applied the human
facial cosmetics.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.335
Do you like them?

00:36.337 --> 00:38.437
-No.
-You look like a clown.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.672
Ugh! Don't come near
us looking like that.

00:41.474 --> 00:43.875
But, are we not
the friends?

00:43.877 --> 00:44.776
Of course, we are.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.412
But only when you look good.

00:47.414 --> 00:49.614
I was not aware the looks
were so important.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.183
They're everything.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.952
Looks are what people base
every decision they make on.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.488
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.024
Haven't you guys heard?
Looks don't matter.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.325
-What?
-Is that true?

01:00.327 --> 01:02.427
Would people say
it if it wasn't?

01:02.429 --> 01:04.162
Then I do not look
the hideous?

01:04.164 --> 01:05.497
Of course you do,

01:05.499 --> 01:09.067
but so did the ugly duckling.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.903
<i>The ugly duckling</i>
<i>looks different from</i>
<i>all the other ducks.</i>

01:11.905 --> 01:15.307
<i>All the poultry on the farm</i>
<i>hassled him for looking weird,</i>

01:15.309 --> 01:16.675
<i>so he ran away.</i>

01:16.677 --> 01:18.710
<i>Years passed but he found</i>
<i>no friends,</i>

01:18.712 --> 01:21.446
<i>until he looked into a puddle</i>
<i>and realized he had become</i>

01:21.448 --> 01:23.448
(EXCLAIMS) <i> a beautiful swan.</i>

01:23.450 --> 01:26.485
<i>Things really turned</i>
<i>around for this guy,</i>
<i>now that he was a swan.</i>

01:26.487 --> 01:28.053
<i>He got to hang out</i>
<i>with other hot swans</i>

01:28.055 --> 01:30.055
<i>and eat cake,</i>
<i>and his life was great.</i>

01:30.057 --> 01:32.891
-The end. So you see,
looks don't matter.
-(GLASS SHATTERS)

01:32.893 --> 01:34.559
Uh, I don't think
you told that right.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.062
If looks don't matter,
how do you pick out pants?

01:37.064 --> 01:40.899
I get to know them first
to see their inner beauty.
Observe.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.702
Hey, pants.
What's your favorite poem?

01:43.704 --> 01:49.708
(DEEP VOICE) Oh, I don't know.
I like the one about taking
the dirt road with weeds.

01:49.710 --> 01:53.044
I like that poem, too.
Your pants have good taste.

01:53.046 --> 01:56.681
See? It's what's on
the inside that matters.

01:56.683 --> 01:58.817
You wanna see
my insides, mama?

01:59.318 --> 02:00.685
(CHOKING)

02:02.321 --> 02:03.822
Better than what's
on the outside.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.894
(WHINING) My whole life
I thought we lived
in a superficial society

02:08.896 --> 02:11.630
that valued beauty
above all else!

02:11.632 --> 02:13.732
Great news!
You're completely wrong.

02:13.734 --> 02:17.436
Guys, knowing that looks
don't matter has given me
the courage to tell you all,

02:17.438 --> 02:20.038
that I'm gonna be
going through a
messamorsiphisness.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.540
Excuse me?

02:21.542 --> 02:23.275
A messamorphisisis.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.377
-Huh?
-A missmorphisimasis.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.647
-I don't think that's a word.
-A missamorsimephesis.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.316
You know, when you get
all changey or whatever.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.951
Uh, what kind of change?

02:32.953 --> 02:35.921
Let's just say, when you see
me again, I'll look different.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.123
So just keep
an open mind, okay?

02:38.125 --> 02:40.992
That will not be the problem,
friend Beast Boy,

02:40.994 --> 02:44.696
for however you look,
we will always hold you
dear in our hearts.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.998
Yeah, even if you look
like clown face, here.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.099
(CHUCKLING)

02:48.835 --> 02:49.935
Huh?

02:58.211 --> 03:00.145
Who put a giant croissant
in the middle of the room?

03:00.147 --> 03:02.280
It's not a croissant.
It's a cocoon.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.949
Oh...

03:03.951 --> 03:07.752
Who put a giant cocoon
in the middle of the room?

03:07.754 --> 03:11.523
Hey, hey, hey.
Get away from that thing.
I've seen this before.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.825
It's an alien incubation pod.

03:13.827 --> 03:17.095
You're not going
to lay your eggs in me.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.364
(SCREAMING)

03:19.366 --> 03:21.032
(SCREAMING)

03:21.034 --> 03:23.802
Mmm.
My nose holes are enjoying

03:23.804 --> 03:26.137
the smoky, burned hair aromas.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.507
Gettin' so nice
and toasty in here.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.408
Man, Beasty would love this.

03:30.410 --> 03:33.812
-Where is he anyway?
-Remember he's going through
his megamorpenus.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.882
Yes! Like the caterpillar
entering its chrysalis and

03:36.884 --> 03:39.150
emerging as the fly
of the butters.

03:39.852 --> 03:41.052
-(BUZZING)
-Oh, no!

03:41.054 --> 03:42.454
-(ROBIN SCREAMING)
-Robin, stop!

03:42.456 --> 03:44.222
Dude,
Beast Boy is in there.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.324
(SCREAMING)

03:46.326 --> 03:48.727
-Robin.
-(SCREAMING)

03:48.729 --> 03:51.196
Come on. I never get
to use this thing.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.732
(SCREAMING)

03:56.469 --> 03:58.703
(GROANS) Out of fuel.

03:58.705 --> 04:02.007
-What were you saying?
-Beast Boy is in there
getting all changey and stuff.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.809
It must be part of
the life cycle triggered
by his animal DNA.

04:04.811 --> 04:08.914
I wonder what friend
Beast Boy would
look like when he emerges.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.015
(SWOONS)

04:19.325 --> 04:23.695
-Hey, mama.
-Take me away,
my man-insect prince.

04:25.898 --> 04:28.667
-What was that, Raven?
-Uh, nothing. Nothing!

04:28.669 --> 04:33.104
(GASPS) Friends,
the cocoon is opening.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.006
TOGETHER: Ooh!

04:36.776 --> 04:38.843
TOGETHER: Ew!

04:39.378 --> 04:41.947
Uh, Beast Boy?

04:41.949 --> 04:43.748
(GROANING)

04:44.483 --> 04:47.452
-Nasty!
-Oh, barf!

04:49.790 --> 04:51.690
(RETCHING)
(SWALLOWING)

04:51.692 --> 04:54.159
Hand me the machine
of fire throwing.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.627
I will end this.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.063
No. That's our friend.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.132
-But he looks so gross.
-What did I tell you?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.534
Looks don't matter.

05:02.536 --> 05:05.270
Oh, yeah.
Forgot about that.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.038
(SPITTING)

05:07.040 --> 05:09.040
Nothing's changed.
He's still our...

out of his own fluids. Yay.

-Oh. Uh.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.262
The crime alert. (RETCH)

05:34.834 --> 05:36.868
It's Killer Moth.
Titans...

05:38.104 --> 05:40.071

Your city shall fall
before my might.

(LAUGHING)

05:46.513 --> 05:49.514
Hold it right there,
Killer Moth.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.283
You'll never stop me, Titans.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.952
Um, who's the new guy?

05:57.056 --> 06:02.093
What are you talking about?
(RETCHING) That's my man,
(RETCHING) Beast Boy.

like Beast Boy.

06:13.473 --> 06:14.673
(CLAMORING)

06:14.675 --> 06:16.041
What? What did I say?

06:16.043 --> 06:18.610
So that's how you
identify a person?

06:18.612 --> 06:20.412
By their looks?

06:20.414 --> 06:23.248
Well, how else am I supposed
to do it?

06:23.250 --> 06:24.382
(CLAMORING)

06:24.384 --> 06:27.452
Perhaps by lookingat his
internal organs instead.

06:27.454 --> 06:28.687
(VOMITING)

06:28.689 --> 06:30.655
Yeah. Get to know the man.

Ask him his favorite song.

06:35.762 --> 06:39.130
Wait. Are you saying
looks don't matter?

06:39.132 --> 06:40.999
That's like walking
into a stinky bathroom

06:41.001 --> 06:43.001
and saying,
"Smells don't matter."

06:43.003 --> 06:44.602
They do. They really do.

06:44.604 --> 06:47.739
We don't believe your twisted
lies, Killer Moth.

06:47.741 --> 06:51.276
But people have been judging
me my whole life by my looks.

06:51.278 --> 06:54.112
That's why I became a super
villain in the first place.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.147
It seems you do not know
the story of the duckling

06:56.149 --> 06:58.249
who was
displeasing to the eye.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.884
Of course, I do,

06:59.886 --> 07:02.420

07:02.422 --> 07:05.323
<i>and is surrounded</i>
<i>by other beautiful swans.</i>

07:08.427 --> 07:10.028
So you're saying ugly things

07:10.030 --> 07:12.230
need to be
with their own kind?

07:12.232 --> 07:15.667
-That's not exactly...
-No wonder we throw up...

And since you are the gross,

07:23.910 --> 07:25.944
and Beast Boy is
also another gross,

07:25.946 --> 07:27.779
you should be
with each other.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.215
-Hey, wait...
-Have fun living together
and being disgusting.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.485

07:33.487 --> 07:37.155

looks don't matter
because they're all hot.

(GROANING)

07:38.658 --> 07:42.527
Yeah. Of course, Robin's
got it going on. They all do.

07:42.529 --> 07:43.995
But I'll show them a world

07:43.997 --> 07:46.131
where everyone looks
the same as us.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.601
And only then will
looks truly not matter.

horrible things to me.

-Killer Moth.
-KILLER MOTH: Welcome, Titans.

08:05.418 --> 08:08.853
Thank you for responding
to the emergency distress call

08:08.855 --> 08:12.357
that I faked.
(LAUGHING)

08:12.359 --> 08:15.994
Anyway. Let me introduce
you to my newest invention.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.996
The bug beam.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.932
It can mutate anyone's DNA.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.334
Soon, the world's population

08:23.336 --> 08:27.372
will be as disfigured as I am.
(LAUGHING)

08:27.374 --> 08:29.607
We'll never let you
activate it, Killer M...

Too late.

08:31.844 --> 08:35.146
(GROANING)

08:36.248 --> 08:39.050
Now that we're
all hideous insects,

08:54.634 --> 08:56.034
You know what?
Forget it.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.703
I was going to mutate
everyone in the world,

08:58.705 --> 09:01.973
thereby, eradicating the
unrealistic beauty standards

09:01.975 --> 09:03.908
imposed by society.

09:03.910 --> 09:07.645
But forget it! I'm done!

the antidote?

09:10.317 --> 09:11.416
No!

09:13.919 --> 09:15.920
Now that we are freaks,

09:15.922 --> 09:18.556
we must live
in a shroud of darkness.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.359
The world must never
see our twisted forms.

then who's this bug?

09:32.539 --> 09:35.139
Oh, that's Chuck.
Silky's friend.

crashed here for the week.

Hey...

09:39.279 --> 09:40.945
Why are you guys
hiding in the dark?

09:40.947 --> 09:43.448
Because we are now
the nightmare creatures,

09:43.450 --> 09:45.283
unfit for illumination.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.086
Yeah. Aren't you
disgusted by us?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.587
Let me ask you this, Cyborg.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.323
We still gonna play
video games together?

09:52.325 --> 09:53.458
Yeah.

Raven, will you punch me

09:56.329 --> 09:57.695
Absolutely.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.565
Star, is your heart still
full of love and friendship?

10:00.567 --> 10:01.799
Indeed.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.635
And Robin, are you gonna
keep on pushing me

10:03.637 --> 10:05.370
to be the best hero I can be?

10:05.372 --> 10:06.771
Of course.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.841
Well, then. It's like you
said, bro. Looks don't matter.
