I WAS LYING IN MY BED,

01:29.572 --> 01:30.738
IN THE DARK.

01:30.740 --> 01:32.006
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

01:32.008 --> 01:33.975
THIS BRIGHT BLUE LIGHT
FILLED THE ROOM.

01:33.977 --> 01:37.178
AND SLOWLY MY BEDROOM
DOOR BEGAN TO OPEN.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.614

01:39.616 --> 01:42.149
I WAS BEING DRAGGED
THROUGH A HALLWAY.

01:42.151 --> 01:44.252
THEN I WAS LYING
ON A TABLE,

01:44.254 --> 01:47.288
AND THESE SCARY ALIENS
WANTED TO OPERATE ON ME.

01:47.290 --> 01:49.857

06:05.414 --> 06:07.448
OKAY, LET'S DITCH

06:24.400 --> 06:26.300
THEY GAVE HIM
AN ANAL PROBE.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.869

ARE USING HIM

15:06.255 --> 15:07.421
AS PART OF
THEIR PLAN.

15:07.423 --> 15:09.556
YOU SHOULD USE
