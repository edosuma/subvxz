WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:04.272
I want to share some news.
(whispers): I'm pregnant.
Who's the lucky guy?

00:04.405 --> 00:06.607
I am not the father.

00:06.707 --> 00:07.608
Shelby was

00:07.708 --> 00:09.577
artificially inseminated.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.645
What are you doing here?
Wade offered me a job.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.682
Hope it's not gonna
be uncomfortable.
Why would it be? No, not at all.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.617
VIVIAN:
 Why didn't you want to meet us?

00:16.717 --> 00:19.019
Family has never meant
more to me than trouble.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.022
I wish we could
start over.
Okay. Yeah.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.024
Vivian Wilkes.
I hear you bought
the Rammer Jammer.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.159
Yeah, you should
come by some time.

00:26.160 --> 00:26.694
Joel can give you
a ride home.
I have a ride.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.662
You ready?

00:31.832 --> 00:34.235
*

00:35.869 --> 00:37.705
ZOE:
 I can't help it.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.074
I feel like I won some sort of
 lottery when I met you guys.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.442
VIVIAN:
 And you didn't even have
 to buy a ticket.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.344
No one has more fun
than the Wilkes.

00:43.444 --> 00:44.745
Sunrise tennis
is awesome.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.747
I love our family
traditions.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.250
I'm not sure
your boyfriend agrees.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.252
Sorry. Catching a
breath back here.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.754
Pathetic. Get in shape, buddy.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.156
What?!

00:55.256 --> 00:57.191
There was one of me
versus two of you.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.426
Oh, brother.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.629
Ladies, nobody told me
it was tennis-skirt Tuesday.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.731
Move along.
Nothing to see here.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.303
Hey. Hey, I am so glad
that you called.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.071
We should make this
a regular thing.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.073
Oh, I'm just thrilled
to get out of the house

01:13.174 --> 01:15.309
and converse with people that
don't drink out of juice boxes.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.410
Life of a single mom.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.745
Right.
Actually,

01:17.845 --> 01:20.080
I've started thinking
about moving on,

01:20.181 --> 01:21.715
the next step, dating.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.184
Wow.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.718
Yeah.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.687
Hey, you know, that's great.
Get back on that horse.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.222
Why don't you let me
set you up.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.090
Really? You'd do that?

01:30.191 --> 01:31.459
Yes. Just let me check and see

01:31.559 --> 01:33.727
if that guy I'm thinking of
is still available.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.763
Okay.
(chuckles)

01:35.863 --> 01:38.332
Hey, what's your take
on Vivian?

01:38.432 --> 01:40.334
Vivian, Zoe's
cousin Vivian?

01:40.434 --> 01:41.802
Yeah.
She's great.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.504
I got half a mind
to ask her out.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.673
You should listen to that half
of your mind.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.107
You guys would make
a great couple.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.177
And then we'd have
a fourth for tennis.

01:49.277 --> 01:51.179
Now, I think we could
totally take them.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.381
It's true, I'm stronger
on the forehand side,

01:53.481 --> 01:55.115
but I'm a monster
at the net.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.284
Easy there, Sparky.

01:57.385 --> 01:58.786
The more you talk about this,
less appealing it seems.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.793
All right.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.795
Yeah. (laughs)

02:07.895 --> 02:09.363
Yeah. See?

02:09.463 --> 02:11.165
Mm.
I call it

02:11.265 --> 02:13.401
Frittata Lambada.

02:13.501 --> 02:14.768
Oh, let me guess.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.205
'Cause it's gonna make
my taste buds dance.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.372
Correct.
Mm.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.274
Also, because it rhymes.
Oh.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.409
Good morning.

02:21.509 --> 02:22.843
Hey. I didn't
know y'all

02:22.943 --> 02:24.745
were coming by
for breakfast.
No.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.748
Even though we should have since
it's been every day for a week.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.184
I don't know that
it's been every day.
LYNLY: No, A.B.'s right.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.452
For whatever reason,

02:31.552 --> 02:32.720
George can't get enough
of y'all's company.

02:32.820 --> 02:33.787
You know what I mean.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.424
Oh, George, uh, come on.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.558
Uh, sure.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.261
I'm gonna need you
at this meeting

02:40.361 --> 02:41.395
this afternoon
with Mayor Gainey and...

02:41.495 --> 02:43.397
Uh, the state
comptroller?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.165
The one where he said he's
pitching us on the merger?

02:45.266 --> 02:46.500
I thought you said that
was a waste of time.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.801
And it is.

02:47.901 --> 02:48.902
I mean, Gainey will never
agree to it, either.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.771
There's one thing that Gainey
and I agree upon,

02:50.871 --> 02:52.172
is that'll be a cold day in hell

02:52.273 --> 02:53.541
before BlueBell
and Fillmore merge.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.444
Okay. So, what's the point?

02:56.544 --> 02:58.346
Today's comptroller
is tomorrow's governor.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.781
He may force the issue, and
Gainey's bringing his attorney,

03:00.881 --> 03:01.882
so I'm bringing you.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.852
Oh, joy, an afternoon
with Scooter McGreevy.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.320
How did I get so lucky?

03:06.420 --> 03:07.755
Oh, and one more thing.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.557
You want to tell Lavon Hayes
why you're avoiding

03:09.657 --> 03:11.559
the fine dining establishments
of BlueBell?

03:11.659 --> 03:13.827
What? I'm not avoiding...

03:13.927 --> 03:15.195
Well, because a suspicious man
might think

03:15.296 --> 03:16.497
it's on account of the fact

03:17.698 --> 03:18.232
that your ex-girlfriend's
working at the Rammer Jammer,

03:19.166 --> 03:20.234
which would imply
you still have feelings...

03:20.334 --> 03:23.203
Lavon, that is not the case.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.472
That's all I need to hear.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.839
Okay.
All right.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.809
Lynly, good news.
George Tucker's taking you out

03:28.909 --> 03:29.910
to breakfast
this morning.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.812
You're welcome.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.317
Yes, Lemon, I have been getting
out of the house.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.418
I got a lunch date today.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.287
No, it's not with Shelby.

03:39.387 --> 03:42.290
It's with Carolee,
if you must know.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.458
Well, I will text you proof
during dessert.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.559
(laughs)
That was a joke.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.561
I'm not gonna text you.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.430
Okay, you go tend
to your grandmother.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.798
All right. Bye.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.800
Oh, Brick,
Thank God.

03:52.900 --> 03:53.801
It's an emergency.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.304
Is it the baby? Contractions?

03:56.404 --> 03:58.406
No. Worse. It's time
for my birthing class,

03:58.506 --> 04:00.341
and I don't
have a partner.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.410
Okay, not really an emergency,

04:02.510 --> 04:04.345
and that shouldn't come
as a surprise.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.913
When I signed up
for the class,

04:06.013 --> 04:07.915
I thought I'd be fine

04:08.015 --> 04:10.618
being a single mom in a
sea full of couples, but

04:10.718 --> 04:13.954
this morning I woke up
in a full-blown panic.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.490
Shelby, can I tell you the truth
about childbirth?

04:16.589 --> 04:18.659
They guy doesn't really
do that much.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.595
I'm gonna be self-conscious, and
then internalize those feelings,

04:21.695 --> 04:23.931
and that can't be good
for the baby, right?

04:24.031 --> 04:28.569
Are you sure you can't come
to just one class with me?

04:28.669 --> 04:30.938
Well, I...

04:32.406 --> 04:34.408
I guess.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.911
Sure, I... I could do that
for you. Why not?

04:38.011 --> 04:39.980
Oh. Thank you, Brick Breeland.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.415
So, when is this class?

04:41.515 --> 04:42.883
Lunchtime today.
You're free, right?

04:46.387 --> 04:48.556
By going out to breakfast,
I thought you meant

04:48.656 --> 04:51.692
one of those new-fangled places
where you sit at the table

04:51.792 --> 04:53.361
and people
take your order.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.329
No, no, no. The thing is,
the Butter Stick Bakery--

04:55.429 --> 04:56.497
they grind their own coffee.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.298
That's why all
the cool kids come here.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.000
Hmm?
George.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.935
Tansy, hey, what are you, uh...?

05:02.035 --> 05:04.572
Butter Stick's got
the best coffee.

05:04.672 --> 05:05.573
GEORGE:
Yeah.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.207
Uh, Tansy, Lynly.
Lynly, Tansy.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.613
Great. Now everyone knows
each other.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.348
Well, I got to get
to the Rammer Jammer.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.449
Shift's starting, so...

05:15.549 --> 05:16.917
How long you been
working there?

05:17.017 --> 05:19.687
Um, a week, ten days.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.490
Y'all should come by
for breakfast.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.625
Huh. Yeah.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.959
(laughs)

05:26.059 --> 05:29.062
So, that's the Tansy
who damaged your goods, Tansy?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.097
Yup, one in the same.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.032
Should I be worried about this?

05:32.132 --> 05:34.001
No. No, absolutely not.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.469
Tansy and I ended a while ago.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.605
She moved on
with Scooter McGreevy,

05:37.705 --> 05:40.574
and I found you,
which means I won.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.975
But you're avoiding
the Rammer Jammer.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.513
Yes. Just because I don't feel
like running into my ex

05:45.613 --> 05:47.014
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.616
It makes it hard to digest.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.618
I get it, George.
I've been there.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.753
And that is why I am
the luckiest guy in the world.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.022
Yes, you are.
(chuckles)

05:55.122 --> 05:56.924
Percy Lewis
composed a symphony.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.225
What college
wouldn't want her?

05:58.325 --> 06:01.361
Randy Foster got two photos
in the National Geographic.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.963
What has Rose Hattenbarger
done? Nothing.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.132
Rose, you're a great kid
who's smart and funny

06:05.232 --> 06:06.934
with loads of potential.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.036
That is not enough.
I need to stand out.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.004
I need...
Internships.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.541
That's how I got accepted to
every college I applied to.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.743
I did internships
all over Manhattan.

06:15.843 --> 06:18.111
Red Cross, CDC,
Doctors Without Borders.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.147
I got coffee for
Dr. Ruth one summer.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.483
Internships. Got it.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.653
Why are there no other adults
in my life I can rely on?

06:35.463 --> 06:37.498
A.B., you're in
the setting-people-up-

06:37.598 --> 06:38.632
on-dates business, right?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.601
Not for money.
That's illegal.

06:40.701 --> 06:41.802
No. I told my cousin Vivian

06:41.902 --> 06:44.071
that I had somebody great
to set her up with, but I don't.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.673
Okay, well, why would
you tell her that?

06:45.773 --> 06:47.675
Because I am trying to prevent

06:47.775 --> 06:48.976
certain disasters
from happening.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.111
Okay.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.013
Hey, I know this
might be weird,

06:53.113 --> 06:55.683
but what about
Vivian and Wade?

06:55.783 --> 06:57.751
I think they might
have a little spark.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.020
That is the disaster I'm trying
to prevent from happening.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.021
Zoe.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.189
No. Oh, no, no.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.558
Not for the reasons
that you think, okay?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.127
It's just, Vivian's just getting
back on that dating horse,

07:08.228 --> 07:09.196
and I don't want to see her
thrown off and trampled

07:09.897 --> 07:11.031
before she has the chance to...

07:11.131 --> 07:12.132
To canter?

07:13.066 --> 07:14.468
Gallop?

07:14.568 --> 07:16.604
I don't really know anything
about horses.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.071
It's just,
I'm in a unique position

07:19.339 --> 07:21.174
to keep my cousin from making
the same mistakes that I did.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.643
Please.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.680
Well... a couple months ago,
Crickett and I made a list

07:26.780 --> 07:29.016
of all of the eligible bachelors
for Lemon.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.451
Let me see if it's still
floating around.
Perfect!

07:31.552 --> 07:33.153
Okay. You're welcome.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.455
Sorry, everyone.

07:36.490 --> 07:39.459
Uh, our comptroller was just
outlining the virtues

07:39.560 --> 07:41.194
of a town merger.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.463
Here you go.
I know it's a tough sell,

07:43.564 --> 07:45.599
but it gets me
out of the office.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.867
(laughter)

07:46.967 --> 07:48.536
All right,
speech is this.

07:48.636 --> 07:49.703
Governor believes

07:50.771 --> 07:51.872
it would save our fine state
millions of dollars

07:53.073 --> 07:55.609
if we can get some of our
less populated towns to merge

07:55.709 --> 07:56.710
with their neighbors.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.812
Well, I know I speak
for Mayor Gainey

07:58.912 --> 08:02.550
when I say, we both relish
our towns' unique identities,

08:02.650 --> 08:03.784
and can't envision

08:03.884 --> 08:05.886
a world in which
they are merged into one.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.487
Well, hold on now.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.890
Don't go putting words
in my mouth there, Mayor Hayes.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.626
Tell your boss that

08:12.726 --> 08:14.194
the people of Fillmore
would love

08:14.294 --> 08:15.863
nothing better than to link arms

08:15.963 --> 08:18.131
and embrace our
brethren to the west.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.232
I'm-I'm sorry. What now?

08:19.332 --> 08:20.568
Fillmore supports the merger.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.636
And the progressive
thinking behind it.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.672
(imitates explosion)
Oh.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.273
Okay. What is he doing?

08:26.373 --> 08:27.507
Is he... All right,
I'm sorry. Is he serious?

08:27.608 --> 08:29.176
Serious as a Liam Neeson movie.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.511
COMPTROLLER: Finally,
I can report some good news

08:31.612 --> 08:32.580
to the governor.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.246
He might put this
on his Twitter.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.249
A visionary alliance,
Mayor Hayes.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.186
Come here, give me a hug.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.220
Uh...

08:40.320 --> 08:41.589
Comptroller Riley,

08:41.688 --> 08:43.155
all due respect.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.559
Please tell the governor
that BlueBell is not,

08:45.659 --> 08:48.295
and will never be interested
in merging with Fillmore.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.763
Uh, George?
Never.

08:49.863 --> 08:50.831
Ever.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.633
Every, ever.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.767
Ever.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.202
COMPTROLLER:
Seems to me, if I was

08:55.302 --> 08:56.203
in charge of BlueBird...

08:56.303 --> 08:57.204
That's BlueBell.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.538
...I would be thrilled

08:58.639 --> 08:59.807
to merge with

08:59.907 --> 09:00.808
the good people
of Fillmore.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.209
I intend

09:02.309 --> 09:03.844
to fast-track this merge
with the governor's office.

09:03.944 --> 09:04.712
You will be
hearing from him.

09:04.812 --> 09:08.181
Good day, gentlemen,
and thank you

09:08.281 --> 09:11.151
for making me
one happy civil servant.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.888
Tucker, this is
gonna be great.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.190
I think when the
merger goes through,

09:17.290 --> 09:18.826
I might buy a boat.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.227
Oh, and, uh...

09:20.327 --> 09:21.829
Tansy and I can be
your neighbors.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.164
Oh...

09:24.264 --> 09:26.199
No, uh, not now,
not now, not now.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.969
(doorbell jingles)

09:31.338 --> 09:33.140
Twice in one day.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.341
I'm so glad you called.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.843
Couldn't wait
to share my news.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.578
I have lined up
an excellent date for you.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.247
His name is
Carter Covington.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.915
I know.
Awesome alliteration.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.583
I have some news
of my own.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.918
I'm going on
a date tonight.

09:45.018 --> 09:45.919
What?
That's great news!

09:46.019 --> 09:46.954
With who?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.894
What do you think
you're doing?

09:53.994 --> 09:56.196
Well, Zoe, this is what
people in my trade call

09:56.296 --> 09:57.297
wiping down a bar.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.199
You asked out Vivian Wilkes?

09:59.299 --> 10:01.234
Hey, it is true what they say:
word does travel fast.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.870
How does this have
anything to do with you?

10:02.970 --> 10:04.938
She's my cousin,
and I'm looking out for her.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.674
Vivian is in
a vulnerable place.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.876
She's just starting to date
after her divorce.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.344
Wow. Can I just say
I am stunned?

10:11.444 --> 10:12.345
And shocked?

10:12.445 --> 10:14.281
And... whew...

10:14.381 --> 10:16.349
just so completely surprised
that you would not approve.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.550
What is that
supposed to mean?

10:17.651 --> 10:20.620
It means that I don't recall
asking for your input, Zoe.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.856
That said, I will

10:22.956 --> 10:24.658
take your words
under consideration.

10:24.758 --> 10:25.392
Really?

10:25.492 --> 10:27.928
(laughs)

10:29.462 --> 10:30.630
(groans)

10:30.731 --> 10:32.933
(car horn honks)

10:33.033 --> 10:35.035
(seagulls calling)

10:35.135 --> 10:37.304
(birds singing)

10:45.045 --> 10:46.246
I don't understand.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.682
What would we even be called?
FillBell?

10:48.782 --> 10:49.983
Doesn't matter
'cause it's not happening.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.920
By definition, a merger means
both towns agree to merge.

10:53.020 --> 10:53.987
Regardless,

10:54.922 --> 10:56.423
Lavon, I think you need
to talk to the town.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.258
Okay? You need to tell
them what's going on.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.359
Have you seen
BlueBell panic?

10:59.459 --> 11:00.861
It's not pretty.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.362
We make this go away first.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.698
But why would Gainey
even want us to merge?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.333
He hates us!

11:06.433 --> 11:08.335
Yeah, he's cooking
something up

11:08.435 --> 11:10.003
in that weasely little mind
of his.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.005
I have an idea
how we can find out.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.941
We just need
to appeal to someone

11:14.041 --> 11:15.876
on the inside of Fillmore.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.978
Someone who's
sympathetic to BlueBell,

11:18.078 --> 11:19.880
but has a foot in each town.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.014
Someone who

11:21.114 --> 11:22.382
works here,
sleeps there.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.951
He's talking about Tansy.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.053
Yeah, I figured that out.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.257
I really appreciate
you coming.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.092
You want to grab coffee?
My treat.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.728
Oh, I would love to,
but I need to get back to work.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.029
But, uh, rain check?

11:36.129 --> 11:38.732
Yeah.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.869
Shelby, you okay?

11:41.969 --> 11:45.305
Yeah, it's just...

11:45.405 --> 11:48.441
(voice breaks): nobody told me
how terrifying this would be.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.711
The days are fine,
but the nights

11:51.812 --> 11:53.881
just freak me out--
all alone in that hotel.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.715
I'm worried that I'm gonna go
into labor,

11:55.816 --> 11:56.917
and the only person
that's gonna be there

11:57.017 --> 11:58.952
is the clerk with the glass eye.
Oh...

12:00.453 --> 12:03.991
Hey, this is BlueBell,
not Bethlehem.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.393
No one's giving
birth in a barn here.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.862
You can knock on any door
at any time,

12:08.962 --> 12:11.298
and someone will always
give you a ride to the hospital.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.733
Thank you, Brick.

12:15.535 --> 12:19.072
So, BlueBell and Fillmore are
gonna be one big super town.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.775
I mean, what would it even
be called? MoreBell?

12:21.875 --> 12:23.510
Well, we want to prevent
that from happening.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.745
So we're wondering if you know
anything about

12:25.846 --> 12:27.480
why Mayor Gainey would want
to merge.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.417
You are close to his lawyer.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.920
I don't know.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.355
But sounds like you're asking me
to spy on Scooter.

12:35.455 --> 12:38.091
We don't see it so much
as spying on Scooter

12:38.191 --> 12:42.362
as we do protecting
the beating heart of BlueBell.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.330
There's a little spying.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.032
You know, I always catch

12:45.132 --> 12:46.433
Scooter reading my texts.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.837
Besides, BlueBell has always
felt more like home to me.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.772
But that means that I don't know
how much help I can be.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.107
I barely ever see Scooter.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.909
He is back and forth
to Montgomery

12:56.009 --> 12:57.144
working on some big money deal

12:57.244 --> 12:59.346
with his law school buddy
Dan Plummer.

12:59.446 --> 13:03.083
Wait a minute.
Do you mean Danny Plummer?

13:03.183 --> 13:06.854
Because Danny Plummer
is a certified insolvency

13:06.954 --> 13:08.421
and restructuring advisor.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.789
I'm sorry. I fell asleep

13:09.890 --> 13:11.091
on the third or fourth
syllable there.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.926
Uh, means he's
a bankruptcy expert.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.195
Scooter's bankrupt?!
That's why we never eat out!

13:15.295 --> 13:17.797
No, no, not Scooter.
Danny works with cities.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.934
That means Fillmore is bankrupt.

13:21.034 --> 13:21.835
LAVON: That's why
they want to merge.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.203
They don't want
a visionary alliance,

13:24.271 --> 13:25.072
they want our piggybank.
Yeah, and if we can prove

13:26.139 --> 13:26.840
that they just want
to come raid our treasury...

13:27.908 --> 13:29.042
Oh, we take it to the governor,
merger goes away.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.110
(snaps fingers)

13:30.210 --> 13:32.812
If... we can find proof.

13:35.015 --> 13:38.952
Dan Plummer's having an office
party tonight-- Hawaiian luau.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.420
Scooter said I could come along.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.955
But I don't like
Hawaiian parties.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.024
The costumes are so demeaning.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.492
Tansy, the future
of BlueBell depends

13:45.592 --> 13:47.227
on you getting us
into that party.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.399
ANNABETH:
 You don't have appointments.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.867
But we're not here
as patients.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.168
We're here as the press.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.537
Yeah, I'm sorry.
The press?

13:57.637 --> 13:59.472
That's right.
The Fourth Estate.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.608
We have some questions
for you.

14:01.708 --> 14:02.876
DASH:
The BlueBell Blawker

14:02.976 --> 14:04.511
here with AnnaBeth Nass,

14:04.611 --> 14:07.981
talking about the rumors
rumbling through BlueBell,

14:08.081 --> 14:10.117
rumors of a town merger.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.985
Merger? What merger?
There's no merger.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.286
No rumors.
Oh, no?

14:13.386 --> 14:16.890
Well, then tell me, why is it
that your paramour, Mayor Hayes,

14:16.990 --> 14:19.026
has been ducking my calls?

14:19.126 --> 14:20.527
Maybe he doesn't like the press.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.462
Nobody likes the press
until they need us.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.531
That's why they call us
the Fourth Estate.

14:24.631 --> 14:25.865
That is completely incorrect.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.168
But, AnnaBeth,
is there or is there not

14:28.268 --> 14:30.938
any truth to the rumors
of a town merger?

14:31.038 --> 14:32.072
No comment.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.107
Except, get out!

14:34.207 --> 14:35.875
Well, the Blawker
will not rest

14:35.976 --> 14:36.876
until we get
the real story!

14:36.977 --> 14:38.878
That's why they call us
the Fourth Estate.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.113
Still no.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.549
What-what...
he asked about the merger?

14:42.649 --> 14:43.984
What'd you say?

14:44.084 --> 14:45.252
Nothing.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.020
Okay, I'm on my way to
Montgomery to derail this thing.

14:47.887 --> 14:48.155
In the meantime,
you need to stall Dash!

14:55.162 --> 14:58.131
(panicked breathing)

14:58.231 --> 15:01.101
A.B., are you okay?

15:01.201 --> 15:04.237
Is this 'cause you heard
about Wade and Vivian?

15:04.337 --> 15:07.107
No. The fate of BlueBell
rests on my shoulders.

15:07.207 --> 15:10.677
It's too much!
I can't even say the words!

15:10.777 --> 15:12.212
Okay, say it
in one breath.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.481
Just get it out.
I'm sure it's not that bad.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.482
Dash Dewitt found out

15:16.316 --> 15:16.916
that BlueBell and Fillmore
might merge,

15:17.985 --> 15:18.318
and he's threatening to write
about it in his blog,

15:19.252 --> 15:20.053
and no one can know about it,
and Lavon said

15:20.653 --> 15:22.255
it's up to me to stop him!

15:22.355 --> 15:23.623
Promise me
you'll help me.

15:23.723 --> 15:26.559
Hell yes! We will not spend
the rest of our lives

15:26.659 --> 15:28.295
with a return address
of BlueMore.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.197
Promise.
All right.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.931
ZOE:
 We in this room

15:32.032 --> 15:34.167
are the only ones
who know about the merger.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.203
You mean except Lavon and
George. Possibly Tansy.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.537
Could be
people in Fillmore.

15:37.637 --> 15:38.571
Shut up.

15:39.506 --> 15:40.974
Lavon is depending on us,
and I have a plan.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.609
We are going to concoct
a juicy scandal

15:42.709 --> 15:44.944
that will be irresistible
to Dash

15:45.045 --> 15:47.014
and will distract him
from the merger.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.515
Genius, right?

15:48.615 --> 15:50.117
I can hear you
rolling your eyes.

15:50.217 --> 15:51.284
What, so Lemon's
out of town,

15:51.384 --> 15:52.952
and you're filling
the shenanigan vacuum?

15:53.053 --> 15:54.254
Well, historically,
there's a long tradition

15:54.354 --> 15:56.189
of secret cabals
dummying up news stories

15:56.289 --> 15:57.290
to distract the press:

15:58.225 --> 15:59.659
um, Thatcher and the
Falkland Islands War,

15:59.759 --> 16:01.594
uh, George Bush and Iraq.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.663
Whoa. You want
to concoct a fake war?

16:03.763 --> 16:05.565
No, dummy, this is BlueBell.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.267
We want to concoct
a fake romance.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.636
Yeah, we could float rumors
that Shelby's baby daddy

16:09.736 --> 16:11.104
is a celebrity,

16:11.204 --> 16:13.140
like Robin Thicke

16:13.240 --> 16:14.241
or Lance Armstrong.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.311
Okay, just spitballing,

16:18.411 --> 16:22.115
but maybe we could
leak a story that you

16:22.215 --> 16:23.983
and George Tucker
secretly got together.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.018
(coughs, laughs)

16:25.918 --> 16:26.619
I am not really
comfortable with that.

16:26.719 --> 16:27.254
Zoe and Wade?

16:27.787 --> 16:28.388
No.
Not a chance.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.691
I guess that leaves me and Joel,
secret affair.

16:31.791 --> 16:32.992
You okay with that?

16:33.093 --> 16:34.027
Why not?

16:34.127 --> 16:35.328
Well, I would love
to stick around

16:35.428 --> 16:38.065
for the weirdest meeting
I've ever been to.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.067
I've got a date.
What, with Vivian?

16:40.167 --> 16:41.601
You're still gonna go out
with her

16:41.701 --> 16:43.603
when the fate of BlueBell
hangs in the balance?

16:43.703 --> 16:45.672
I think you'll be fine
without me.

16:45.772 --> 16:49.008
And, uh, I'm out of
the fake relationship business.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.278
Come on. Am I wrong?

16:51.378 --> 16:53.213
It's hard to say.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.281
Now, to the outside observer,

16:55.215 --> 16:55.748
you might seem a little jealous
and crazy.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.017
I'm worried.
Wade plays with women

16:59.086 --> 17:01.088
and then tosses them aside
like chew toys or socks.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.290
I'm trying not to let
this get to me,

17:03.390 --> 17:06.059
but you seem a little
irrational about them.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.295
It's not irrational,
it's evolutional.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.195
It's not a word.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.363
The biological instinct

17:10.463 --> 17:12.031
to protect family--

17:12.132 --> 17:14.334
who, in this case, happens to
be a vulnerable single mom

17:14.434 --> 17:16.769
who does not need
to be tossed aside like a sock.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.306
Darwin?
Natural selection?

17:19.406 --> 17:20.272
Look it up.

17:23.343 --> 17:26.378
Okay. Well, I guess
I know what drove fake me

17:26.479 --> 17:27.780
to that fake affair.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.062
I feel like an idiot.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.297
Yeah, I second
that emotion.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.665
TANSY:
Well, cry me a river.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.634
If either of y'all want
to swap outfits with me,

17:47.734 --> 17:48.635
you're more than welcome.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.703
So what's the plan here?

17:50.803 --> 17:52.739
I'll go in first,
get Scooter to introduce me

17:52.839 --> 17:54.073
to Dan Plummer, distract him,

17:54.174 --> 17:55.342
then when I give
you the sign,

17:55.442 --> 17:57.310
you find his office.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.746
Okay. And how are you gonna
distract him again?

17:59.846 --> 18:01.748
George, grass skirt,
coconuts on my boobs? Hello?

18:01.848 --> 18:03.383
Ah, yeah.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.485
Whatever happens,
you know the rule.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.855
Oh, yes. Keep you away
from the photocopy room.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.423
When George and
I were together,

18:10.523 --> 18:13.426
he took me to this
Bar Association thingy.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.861
It was a new members gala.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.729
Someone spiked the punch,
and I might

18:16.829 --> 18:19.299
have, uh, done
some scandalous things

18:19.399 --> 18:21.234
at the photocopy machine.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.802
To the photocopy
machine.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.103
(chuckles):
She did. She...

18:24.204 --> 18:25.205
You had to have
been there.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.341
These coconuts are not gonna
distract themselves.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.476
I'm going in.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.279
(laughs)

18:32.379 --> 18:34.113
(clears throat)

18:34.214 --> 18:36.183
*

18:41.221 --> 18:43.756
Starting to think this
wasn't such a good idea.

18:43.856 --> 18:44.824
Just...

18:44.924 --> 18:47.860
Okay, there's the signal.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.729
Here we go.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.732
*

19:07.280 --> 19:10.149
Lemon, hey, this constant
checking in is starting

19:10.250 --> 19:13.186
to make me feel like I'm talking
to my grade school principal.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.822
No, I am on my way
to dinner with Carolee.

19:15.922 --> 19:16.823
(knocking)

19:16.923 --> 19:18.258
Ooh, that's her now.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.460
Uh, just say hi to Mother. Okay.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.162
Shelby!

19:23.263 --> 19:25.164
Surprise! Well, not really.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.366
No, really!

19:26.466 --> 19:28.167
I'm taking you up
on your offer!

19:28.268 --> 19:30.203
You said that I should
take advantage of BlueBell,

19:30.303 --> 19:31.438
move in to town.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.440
Please tell me
that's what you meant,

19:33.540 --> 19:35.308
'cause I just got rid
of my room at the motel.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.943
Uh, yeah, of course...

19:37.043 --> 19:40.380
(sighs)
It is so relaxing here.

19:41.381 --> 19:44.584
So good for the baby!

19:44.684 --> 19:46.819
Oh!

19:46.919 --> 19:48.588
(sighs)

19:48.688 --> 19:50.857
Where should
we put my stuff?

19:54.461 --> 19:56.329
Nuzzle her neck
or something.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.331
Did you say
"nuzzle her neck"?
Are you sure?

19:59.466 --> 20:01.968
All right.
Let me just...

20:02.068 --> 20:04.203
Run your fingers
through her hair.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.572
Okay.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.540
Ow!
All right, sorry.
My bad.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.409
A.B., look illicit.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.210
More illicit.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.479
Too illicit!

20:12.579 --> 20:15.348
Just... I don't know.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.450
ZOE:
Oh, hello, Wade.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.355
Poor Vivian--
he's totally working her.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.223
Hello, Zoe!

20:24.324 --> 20:25.858
We are not making
out over here

20:25.958 --> 20:27.394
for the fun of it!

20:27.494 --> 20:29.862
Yeah, well, I mean,
just a little fun.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.831
Sorry. Okay, A.B.,
I want you to pick

20:31.931 --> 20:33.500
three or four
of the best pictures

20:33.600 --> 20:34.834
and send them to
Dash anonymously.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.503
That should be enough
to get him started.

20:36.603 --> 20:40.440
If not, I'll send him
some of our dirty text messages.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.874
You need to write those.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.843
JOEL: Oh, yeah. I'll make them
exceedingly filthy.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.445
ANNABETH:
Perfect!

20:45.545 --> 20:46.579
See you on
the flip side.

20:49.949 --> 20:50.917
Zoe?

20:51.017 --> 20:52.251
Huh?

20:52.352 --> 20:53.286
Well, can you believe this?

20:53.386 --> 20:55.388
He didn't even take her
out of town for dinner.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.559
Oh, all right.
Look, enough is enough.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.928
It's one thing to be protective
of your cousin,

21:02.028 --> 21:04.964
but this... this is getting
a little bananas.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.266
Joel, I just found my family
after all these years.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.901
Huh?
They're not gonna be

21:09.001 --> 21:11.404
happy with me when this
just blows up in her face.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.272
Do you really think
it's bananas

21:13.373 --> 21:14.641
to want to keep
that from happening?

21:15.908 --> 21:18.345
No, but it is bananas to try and
forbid two adults from dating,

21:18.445 --> 21:19.912
and then spying
on them from an alley.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.649
I am not... Shh!

21:24.083 --> 21:26.453
See? Bananas.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.327
(knocking)

21:34.427 --> 21:35.495
Carolee?

21:36.529 --> 21:37.597
You sounded so sick
when you canceled dinner.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.299
I wanted to make sure
you had something to eat.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.300
Oh, you shouldn't have.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.268
Oh, it's nothing.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.437
Heat this for 20 minutes
at 300 degrees...

21:44.537 --> 21:46.539
SHELBY: Bricky?
I'm doing laundry.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.675
Want me to throw
anything in for ya?

21:50.109 --> 21:51.511
Uh, this is...

21:51.611 --> 21:53.513
Oh!

21:53.613 --> 21:55.982
...not what you think!

21:56.082 --> 21:59.386
She made us dinner?
Amazing.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.688
You were right
about BlueBell.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.022
Mother Mary
should've given birth

22:03.122 --> 22:04.023
to her little tyke right here.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.426
(sighs)
JOEL:
 You know what I think?

22:06.526 --> 22:08.461
I think Wade might be
great for her.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.029
I've been hanging out
with the guy.

22:10.129 --> 22:11.330
He's, uh, he's awesome.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.432
You know? He's fun.

22:12.532 --> 22:13.500
He's laid back.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.668
Plus, street smarts.

22:15.768 --> 22:16.936
Wish I had those.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.004
Maybe you should date him.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.706
Believe me, Wade
is not as dreamy

22:19.806 --> 22:21.340
as you think, okay?

22:21.441 --> 22:22.609
I know better than anyone.

22:23.743 --> 22:24.944
You know what? I should
call Vivian and rescue her.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.012
(stammers)
Zoe Hart?

22:26.112 --> 22:26.813
What?

22:26.913 --> 22:28.681
Let them make
their own mistakes.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.016
Stay out of it.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.351
It's called recognizing
that you're being nuts

22:32.452 --> 22:34.353
and butting out.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.055
Promise me.

22:36.155 --> 22:38.124
(cell phones chiming)

22:46.533 --> 22:48.968
I think we've entered phase two.

22:49.068 --> 22:49.969
Act natural.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.504
WANDA:
Zoe,

22:52.739 --> 22:53.440
I need to show you something
at the bar-- something private.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.141
Medical. Medically private.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.382
Dash just blasted out
a news flash.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.051
And, well, you're gonna
hear it sooner or later.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.086
Joel and AnnaBeth are
having an affair.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.390
Oh, my God,
I don't believe it.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.560
There are more
pictures, Zoe.

23:13.660 --> 23:14.994
Very graphic.
He's nuzzling her neck.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.664
(gasps)
God, nuzzling?

23:17.764 --> 23:19.799
That is so illicit!

23:19.899 --> 23:22.802
If you need a shoulder to
cry on, I've got two right here.

23:27.474 --> 23:29.676
Is it true?

23:29.776 --> 23:31.077
You and AnnaBeth?

23:31.177 --> 23:32.512
Zoe, I'm sorry.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.413
We just... we got
carried away.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.983
You know, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.751
(gasps)

23:38.851 --> 23:40.019
(yells)
(crowd gasps)

23:43.255 --> 23:44.423
(yells)
(crowd gasps)

23:45.758 --> 23:46.759
(huffs)

23:51.230 --> 23:52.599
I got to ask you something.

23:52.699 --> 23:54.100
Well, the answer is yes.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.003
What we are doing could
be construed as illegal.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.105
However, the courts
have ruled

23:59.205 --> 24:00.573
that there's
a limited expectation

24:00.673 --> 24:02.108
of privacy at office
parties, so we...

24:02.208 --> 24:04.043
No, no, I-I got to ask you
about Tansy.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.778
(sighs)

24:05.878 --> 24:07.446
Lavon, we had this
conversation, okay?

24:07.547 --> 24:08.648
Mm-hmm, and then I spent
a couple hours

24:08.748 --> 24:10.016
with you two in a car.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.784
Saw you see your ex
in a grass skirt.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.120
Lavon, I am over Tansy.
I told you that already.

24:14.220 --> 24:17.590
Well, maybe I'm seeing things
where there's nothing to see.

24:17.690 --> 24:18.791
But I need you to swear

24:18.891 --> 24:20.627
that you will not
break my cousin's heart.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.695
Lavon, I'm not gonna
break... Holy crap.

24:22.795 --> 24:23.830
That's not what I mean.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.132
No, I mean holy crap,
I found the Fillmore files.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.034
Oh, oh. And?

24:28.134 --> 24:29.736
Well, they are...

24:29.836 --> 24:31.604
most definitely not bankrupt.

24:31.704 --> 24:32.705
Uh, far from it.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.473
Well, we got to find
a smoking gun.

24:34.574 --> 24:35.875
I mean, if Gainey's
not after our money,

24:35.975 --> 24:37.610
why is he supporting
the merger?

24:37.710 --> 24:40.547
Because he doesn't
think it's a merger.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.582
He thinks it's an
annexation, look.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.151
Well, what the hell?

24:45.251 --> 24:46.185
Where'd BlueBell go?

24:46.285 --> 24:47.620
It's all Fillmore.
Yeah.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.089
He's gonna try and take
over the whole town.

24:50.189 --> 24:52.491
"West Fillmore, East Fillmore"?

24:52.592 --> 24:54.627
Our town square's gonna be a...
No, no.

24:54.727 --> 24:55.828
Don't look, don't look at that.

24:55.928 --> 24:56.829
You don't want
to look at that.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.498
Nah, nah.
I said don't...

24:59.599 --> 25:01.233
A giant mall?

25:03.135 --> 25:05.104
Called Gainey Shopping Center.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.740
No! No, no, no.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.742
No...

25:09.842 --> 25:11.210
I can't speak!

25:11.310 --> 25:12.511
Yeah, that's
the first sign of shock.

25:13.445 --> 25:13.846
So we're gonna
go ahead and get you home

25:14.647 --> 25:15.882
so AnnaBeth can
take care of you.

25:19.652 --> 25:20.753
LAVON:
 You and Joel?

25:20.853 --> 25:22.288
Zoe's Joel?

25:22.388 --> 25:24.523
That's the distraction
you came up with?

25:24.624 --> 25:25.892
We didn't have a lot of time.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.627
And the story has legs.

25:27.727 --> 25:30.529
Dash is covering
Joel-a-Beth 24/7.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.531
The photos really sold it.
Photos?

25:32.632 --> 25:34.200
Don't worry, uh, some nuzzling.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.935
A little kissing. No tongue.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.604
I got to sit down.
(stammers)

25:37.704 --> 25:38.671
You can't.

25:39.606 --> 25:39.639
Did you see the gathering
on your property?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.875
Those people are holding
a vigil to show you support.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.110
They are watching us right now.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.745
We need to wave
our arms around,

25:45.845 --> 25:48.114
and pretend
we're having a big fight.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.548
Oh, no, we don't.

25:49.649 --> 25:50.249
Oh, yes, we do.

25:50.349 --> 25:51.951
For BlueBell.
(groans)

25:52.051 --> 25:53.319
We need to pretend
we're having a big fight.

25:53.419 --> 25:54.854
And then I will
storm out in tears

25:54.954 --> 25:56.255
and sleep at my place. Ready?

25:56.355 --> 25:57.556
(snaps fingers)

25:59.291 --> 26:01.293
Wave them!

26:02.829 --> 26:04.230
ZOE:
 Vivian?

26:04.330 --> 26:05.832
Is everything okay?

26:05.932 --> 26:07.634
I was just about to ask
you the same thing.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.669
I read about Joel and
the mayor's girlfriend.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.203
Oh, that.
You can't believe

26:11.303 --> 26:12.571
everything you read
in the Blawker.

26:13.606 --> 26:14.140
It's fine, really.
I want to know about your date.

26:14.941 --> 26:15.942
Look, I should
preface this by saying

26:16.876 --> 26:18.177
that I am sorry
and I should've warned you.

26:18.277 --> 26:19.712
What? No.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.581
It was a blast actually.

26:22.682 --> 26:25.151
Wade's like a
walking carnival.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.686
And I think I want
to see him again.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.154
But that scares me.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.922
Because I know it would
only be a second date,

26:30.022 --> 26:32.659
but I'm sort of the kind of
person who gets attached easily.

26:32.759 --> 26:33.793
Oh, my God, me, too.

26:33.893 --> 26:34.894
It must be a family trait.

26:35.795 --> 26:36.896
I've heard all the rumors
about Wade.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.698
I grew up
two towns over.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.600
But the Wade I was with tonight,
he was not that guy.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.836
And I know, you two
broke up for a reason.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.005
And so I want
to know what you think.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.842
Vivian, I-I'm not
comfortable with...

26:49.942 --> 26:51.177
Wade's a friend.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.379
Just tell me this--
if you were a single mom,

26:53.479 --> 26:56.282
and you were
just maybe ready to get

26:56.382 --> 26:58.617
in your first new relationship
since your marriage ended,

26:58.718 --> 27:01.620
would Wade Kinsella be
the guy you choose?

27:01.721 --> 27:03.656
I'm gonna have
to take the Fifth.

27:03.756 --> 27:06.225
I am recusing myself
from this conversation,

27:06.325 --> 27:07.727
like judges do.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.328
Okay.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.799
I understand what you're saying.

27:12.899 --> 27:14.934
No, no.
No, you don't understand.

27:15.034 --> 27:17.403
Because I am neutral.
I'm Switzerland.

27:17.503 --> 27:18.771
I'm saying nothing.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.707
"Nothing" means nothing.

27:20.807 --> 27:21.774
It's okay.

27:21.874 --> 27:22.809
I get it.

27:22.909 --> 27:24.343
Thanks, cuz.

27:24.443 --> 27:26.846
Good night.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.314
Thanks for everything.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.316
Wha...? No, no,
not-not everything.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.719
Nothing!
You mean thanks for nothing!

27:43.062 --> 27:44.396
Lavon, I think...
Oh, please, don't say

27:44.496 --> 27:45.798
it's time to tell
BlueBell what's going on.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.700
It's time to tell BlueBell...

27:47.800 --> 27:48.935
Okay, fine, I-I'll call

27:49.035 --> 27:50.669
an emergency town meeting
this afternoon.

27:53.072 --> 27:54.673
Lavon, everything okay?

27:54.774 --> 27:56.242
I've read about A.B. and Joel.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.844
Don't believe
everything you read.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.813
Unless it sails through Alabama
state legislature at midnight.

28:00.913 --> 28:01.981
Then believe it.
I got to get to the office.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.382
Lavon will fill you in.
Lunch later?

28:03.482 --> 28:04.416
It's a date.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.818
Okay.

28:06.853 --> 28:07.987
(door closes)

28:08.087 --> 28:09.288
Should I be worried?

28:09.388 --> 28:10.723
(stammers)

28:10.823 --> 28:11.924
The town is in trouble,

28:12.925 --> 28:14.060
but we-we haven't started
to fight back yet.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.394
You let me...

28:16.863 --> 28:19.365
...do the worrying.

28:19.465 --> 28:21.067
Lynly?

28:22.334 --> 28:24.070
You're not asking
about BlueBell, are you?

28:24.170 --> 28:26.405
Lavon...

28:26.505 --> 28:28.841
you were with George
and Tansy yesterday.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.109
Tell me the truth.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.078
Do you think he still
has feelings for her?

28:36.048 --> 28:37.917
BRICK:
 Shelby,

28:38.017 --> 28:40.953
when we first met, you were
a closet organizer, right?

28:41.053 --> 28:43.489
Florida's preeminent
closet organizer.

28:43.589 --> 28:47.459
Right, so imagine an
immaculately organized closet

28:47.559 --> 28:50.863
torn asunder by a tornado.

28:50.963 --> 28:53.365
Everything used to have
its place, but now...

28:53.465 --> 28:54.433
chaos.

28:55.367 --> 28:56.803
Maternity gowns
where the suits used to be

28:56.903 --> 28:58.404
and-and baby booties
on the tie rack,

28:58.504 --> 29:01.073
and-and in the drawer which used
to contain cuff links

29:01.173 --> 29:03.742
and a social life is now filled
with birthing classes

29:03.843 --> 29:06.312
and crying jags.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.881
I take it we've moved
into metaphor.

29:08.981 --> 29:13.452
Shelby, I-I really need my life
to stay my life.

29:13.552 --> 29:16.488
Brick Breeland,
you are not telling me,

29:16.588 --> 29:19.525
at seven months pregnant,
to go find another place to live

29:19.625 --> 29:20.927
when you were the one
that told me

29:21.027 --> 29:22.761
to stay with you
in the first place!

29:22.862 --> 29:23.762
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:23.863 --> 29:24.763
I did nothing of the sort.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.133
Well, then how do you
explain me being there?

29:27.233 --> 29:28.534
How do I explain?!

29:28.634 --> 29:31.370
You-you took advantage
of my polite nature

29:31.470 --> 29:34.907
and the fact that
I cannot say no to you!

29:35.007 --> 29:36.775
You hijacked my life.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.511
You sent the woman I was
dating running for the hills.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.347
And you've turned me
into a monster

29:41.447 --> 29:43.082
who yells at a
seven-month pregnant

29:43.182 --> 29:45.117
single mother-to-be!

29:46.585 --> 29:48.787
Are you okay?

29:50.489 --> 29:51.924
Should I get you
something to drink?

30:08.440 --> 30:09.876
ROSE:
Dash?

30:09.976 --> 30:11.543
Hattenbarger. Stop the presses.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.545
It's a saying.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.215
Do you want to hear
my scoop or not?

30:16.315 --> 30:18.817
I appreciate you letting me
crash here, man.

30:18.918 --> 30:21.120
Zoe and I planned
the big fight,

30:21.220 --> 30:23.122
but never decided
who was gonna sleep where.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.523
Everybody loves a
fake relationship

30:24.623 --> 30:25.958
till you become
the dude sleeping

30:26.058 --> 30:27.826
on another dude's couch.
Coffee?

30:27.927 --> 30:29.428
Room service. Sweet.

30:29.528 --> 30:30.829
Well, it ain't free.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.232
I need some advice on the topic
of one Vivian Wilkes.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.234
Why? Did it not
go well last night?

30:35.334 --> 30:36.502
No, it went great last night.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.070
The problem was this morning.
I kept waking up

30:39.271 --> 30:40.006
thinking I should call her
'cause I want to see her again.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.942
Well, it sounded good so far.
What's the problem here?

30:43.042 --> 30:44.977
Well, I'm not a "call you
the next morning" kind of guy.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.613
(laughing):
I mean, come on, who does that?

30:47.713 --> 30:48.948
I do.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.216
I called Zoe

30:50.316 --> 30:52.018
the day after our first date.
I woke her up.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.053
She yelled at me.
It was adorable.

30:54.153 --> 30:55.487
Actually, I read
this Russian short story once...

30:55.587 --> 30:56.989
I'm sure whatever you're
gonna say is fascinating,

30:57.089 --> 30:58.424
but just put a lid on it,
will you?

30:58.524 --> 30:59.892
(chuckles)

31:01.693 --> 31:03.996
Vivian Wilkes, Wade Kinsella.

31:04.096 --> 31:05.531
You might remember me
as the dashing gentleman

31:05.631 --> 31:06.966
from last night.
(chuckles)

31:07.066 --> 31:08.000
Yeah.

31:08.968 --> 31:11.203
Zoe Hart, just the person
I was coming to see.

31:11.303 --> 31:12.438
Something wrong?

31:12.538 --> 31:13.940
The office opens
in ten minutes.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.008
Something's wrong,
but it ain't medical.

31:16.108 --> 31:18.010
You know me, Doc,
I'm not the kind of guy

31:18.110 --> 31:20.212
who loses sleep over rejection
by the opposite sex.

31:20.312 --> 31:21.981
It's a numbers game.
Oh, boy.

31:22.081 --> 31:24.050
I had a pretty great time
with your cousin last night,

31:24.150 --> 31:25.251
which makes it
all the more curious

31:25.351 --> 31:27.619
when I called her this morning,
she had a change of heart.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.122
Seems she decided that
because she's a single mom,

31:30.222 --> 31:33.159
she didn't want to be hanging
around the likes of me.

31:33.259 --> 31:36.628
What do you suppose inspired
this revelation, Dr. Hart?

31:36.728 --> 31:39.165
Vivian came to me
after your date.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.499
She wanted my opinion.

31:41.567 --> 31:42.969
But since I'm not the most

31:43.069 --> 31:44.937
objective person on the subject,

31:45.037 --> 31:47.106
I recused myself.
You did what now?

31:47.206 --> 31:48.907
I stayed out of it.
I said "No comment."

31:49.008 --> 31:50.509
I'm Switzerland.
"No comment"?

31:50.609 --> 31:52.611
That's like saying, "Stay away
from him, he's a jerk,"

31:52.711 --> 31:54.146
but with fewer words.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.049
What? I thought you'd be happy
that I kept the truth to myself.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.217
It wasn't easy, you know.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.252
Oh, oh, the truth.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.988
Please, enlighten me.

32:02.088 --> 32:04.623
Any relationship
that she were to have with you

32:04.723 --> 32:06.058
probably wouldn't last.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.326
That's fine for

32:07.426 --> 32:09.261
the Susies and the Daisies
and the Bambis,

32:09.361 --> 32:10.929
but, you know,
Vivian's a single mom

32:11.030 --> 32:12.198
and she can't afford
to get hurt.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.199
You mean like you did.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.601
Because you can
see the future

32:15.701 --> 32:18.104
for everybody in the world,
as they're all just like you.

32:20.106 --> 32:22.208
How long are you planning on
punishing me?

32:22.308 --> 32:23.542
Because the last time I checked,

32:23.642 --> 32:25.077
you were the one
who walked away.

32:25.177 --> 32:26.545
I'm not punishing you.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.080
I'm protecting Vivian
because she's family.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.581
I was just telling her
the truth.

32:29.681 --> 32:30.316
The truth.

32:30.416 --> 32:31.550
Yeah.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.219
Yeah, I got that.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.554
Or maybe the truth is
I make Vivian happy.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.556
Maybe the truth is
that everyone in this town

32:37.656 --> 32:39.258
can see that I've changed
except for you.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.295
Maybe you need to ask yourself
why it is exactly

32:43.395 --> 32:46.232
you don't want me dating
so close to home.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.547
Zoe, I need to talk to you.

33:01.647 --> 33:02.381
Rose, look, I'm just...

33:02.481 --> 33:04.116
I'm not in a good
place right now.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.251
I'm going crazy.

33:05.351 --> 33:06.752
I thought I did
the right thing,

33:06.852 --> 33:08.587
but now I think I did
something terrible.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.322
Opened my big mouth
and hurt people.

33:10.422 --> 33:11.990
I've never felt so guilty.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.125
That's weird.
Me, too.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.993
I bet mine's worse.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.662
I saw Lavon and A.B.
secretly smooching,

33:16.762 --> 33:18.064
even though they're
supposed to be broken up,

33:19.098 --> 33:19.998
so I called Dash and told him
the A.B.-Joel affair

33:21.167 --> 33:22.234
was probably faked to throw us
off the trail of the merger,

33:23.202 --> 33:24.236
and now he's posting
that story on the Blawker.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.637
I'm sorry.

33:25.737 --> 33:26.772
You did what?

33:26.872 --> 33:27.573
You called Dash?

33:27.673 --> 33:29.141
Okay, yes, yours
might be worse.

33:29.241 --> 33:30.276
I'm a journalist.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.011
I have a moral obligation
to tell the truth.

33:33.112 --> 33:34.580
Don't I?

33:34.680 --> 33:37.149
Sometimes what you think is the
truth might not be the truth.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.684
So it wasn't a fake affair

33:38.784 --> 33:40.419
designed to distract us
from the merger?

33:40.519 --> 33:42.588
Oh, no, that was true.
That was the plan,

33:42.688 --> 33:44.290
but apparently
there were holes in it.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.158
Rose, the thing is,

33:46.258 --> 33:48.794
sometimes there's good reasons
not to tell people everything

33:48.894 --> 33:50.429
just because you
think it's true.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.663
Like the town finding out

33:51.763 --> 33:53.165
it's about to merge
with its mortal enemy

33:53.265 --> 33:54.333
and there'll be
looting in the streets?

33:55.301 --> 33:56.268
Or two people who
might be happy together

33:57.336 --> 33:59.105
won't see each other again
because you acted crazy?

33:59.205 --> 34:01.240
Um, that one doesn't
apply to me.

34:01.340 --> 34:03.109
Are you sure that Dash is
gonna publish the story?

34:03.209 --> 34:05.177
It's a pretty big story
for BlueBell.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.378
All right, you need
to go warn Lavon.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.280
Now. Now. Go.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.050
(sighs):
Oh, God.

34:16.121 --> 34:18.623
Is this going to be
brutally difficult? Absolutely.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.292
The steepest political
challenge you have ever faced

34:20.391 --> 34:22.060
in your life, undoubtedly.

34:22.161 --> 34:24.196
Is the inspirational
part of this speech coming?

34:24.295 --> 34:26.132
Yeah.
Mayor Hayes,
I have to talk to you.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.399
Later, Rose.
We are in pregame.

34:28.699 --> 34:31.469
Moments like this
forge true leaders.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.771
Churchill in the Blitz.

34:32.871 --> 34:33.772
Kennedy's missile crisis.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.774
Lavon Hayes
and the town merger.

34:35.873 --> 34:37.743
What do all these
events have in common?

34:37.842 --> 34:39.745
A fearless leader.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.313
And the people who love him.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.315
ROSE:
Yeah, about that

34:43.415 --> 34:44.750
last part, I think
you should know

34:44.850 --> 34:46.083
there's a small chance
that Dash

34:46.185 --> 34:47.418
has posted a story
about the merger.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.487
And by "small chance"
you mean...

34:49.588 --> 34:51.357
Dash just posted a story
about the merger.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.393
Ah...

34:57.363 --> 34:59.097
Carolee.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.166
Hi.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.802
I wasn't sure which flowers
would say, uh...

35:03.902 --> 35:05.304
"I'm sorry I
didn't tell you

35:05.404 --> 35:06.338
about my pregnant
roommate"?

35:06.438 --> 35:08.307
Yeah.
(laughs)

35:08.407 --> 35:09.841
I just...
I couldn't figure out

35:09.941 --> 35:12.711
how to explain Shelby
without scaring you off,

35:12.811 --> 35:14.780
so I'm just gonna
dive in.
Brick.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.448
There's really
no need.
Yeah, there is.

35:16.548 --> 35:17.883
I want you to understand.

35:17.983 --> 35:19.418
I do,
I understand.

35:19.518 --> 35:20.786
I ran into Shelby
this morning,

35:20.886 --> 35:22.120
and she explained
the whole thing.

35:22.221 --> 35:23.189
Oh, boy. She did, huh?

35:23.289 --> 35:24.323
She said how you'd been

35:25.257 --> 35:26.192
together, and even
though you're not now...

35:26.292 --> 35:27.125
No, we're not.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.394
...how you've really

35:28.494 --> 35:29.461
been there
for that baby.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.530
Not my baby,
by the way.
She said

35:31.630 --> 35:33.265
it wouldn't be possible
for you to care more

35:33.365 --> 35:35.267
about a baby, even
if it were your own.

35:35.367 --> 35:36.268
God...

35:36.368 --> 35:37.469
That made me cry.

35:37.569 --> 35:40.272
I think you're amazing.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.140
No. No.
I'm not amazing.

35:42.241 --> 35:45.143
Brick... you should
be with Shelby.

35:45.244 --> 35:46.412
What? No.

35:46.512 --> 35:48.414
I-I don't want
to be with Shelby.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.316
I want to be with you.

35:50.416 --> 35:51.383
Really?

35:51.483 --> 35:52.551
Look at your life.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.152
This isn't my life.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.155
This is just the things that
happen when Shelby is around.

35:57.256 --> 35:59.758
The universe
bends to her will.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.293
Brick...

36:01.393 --> 36:02.794
you're a sweet man.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.565
But, like my daddy
used to say,

36:06.665 --> 36:08.267
if enough people
tell you you're drunk,

36:08.367 --> 36:10.202
sometimes it's a good
idea to lie down.

36:19.311 --> 36:20.579
(exhales)

36:20.679 --> 36:22.481
(clamoring)

36:22.581 --> 36:25.384
Look, if we could all
just settle down now.

36:25.484 --> 36:26.418
(crowd quiets)

36:26.518 --> 36:27.253
Is it true

36:27.353 --> 36:28.754
BlueBell's merging
with Fillmore?

36:28.854 --> 36:30.956
Well, nothing is set in stone.

36:31.056 --> 36:33.392
Did you tell AnnaBeth
and Joel Stevens

36:33.492 --> 36:35.527
to fake a relationship
to distract us?

36:35.627 --> 36:39.265
What did you know
and when did you know it?

36:39.365 --> 36:41.600
(clamoring)

36:43.034 --> 36:44.536
Let the man speak!

36:44.636 --> 36:45.771
(crowd quiets)

36:45.871 --> 36:47.773
Look, I know
we're all upset.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.508
And-and I should've
told you about the merger

36:49.608 --> 36:50.976
when I first
heard about it.

36:52.244 --> 36:53.812
But I was hoping to-to handle
it before anyone got worried.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.315
Now, look, I'm not
gonna lie to you.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.784
This merger with Fillmore
is still a threat.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.786
But I promise
you, I will do

37:00.886 --> 37:02.788
everything in my power
to fight it.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.456
Now is not the time to panic.

37:04.556 --> 37:05.591
If not now, when?

37:05.691 --> 37:06.592
(clamoring)

37:06.692 --> 37:08.226
Sergeant Jeffries...

37:08.327 --> 37:10.362
No, no, I'm not talking to you,
I'm talking to them.

37:10.462 --> 37:11.363
I want to know.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.932
When is it a good time to panic?

37:14.032 --> 37:15.601
CROWD:
Yeah!

37:15.701 --> 37:16.902
When we're all Fillmorons?

37:17.002 --> 37:18.470
I say panic now!

37:18.570 --> 37:19.571
Panic now!

37:19.671 --> 37:20.839
No. No!

37:20.939 --> 37:23.309
(clamoring)

37:29.648 --> 37:31.249
(knocking)

37:31.350 --> 37:32.183
Oh.

37:32.284 --> 37:33.952
Zoe, I didn't know
you were coming by.

37:34.052 --> 37:35.487
Get you something
to drink?

37:35.587 --> 37:38.256
I don't deserve
anything to drink.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.458
Vivian, I messed up

37:39.558 --> 37:42.027
when I tried to steer you
away from Wade.

37:42.127 --> 37:43.529
No, you were
very clear.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.397
You were neutral.
You were Switzerland.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.032
(sighs)
Did you tell Wade that

37:47.132 --> 37:48.867
you didn't want to go
out with him again?

37:48.967 --> 37:50.969
Uh, that's kind of
between me and Wade.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.270
I agree.

37:53.305 --> 37:54.573
Unless part of it has to do
with what I told you.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.877
I-I don't know why
I went bananas

37:58.977 --> 38:02.348
when I found out that Wade
asked you out, but I did.

38:02.448 --> 38:04.516
I am not holding
a torch for Wade.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.618
Believe me.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.654
I-I love Joel.
I have never been happier.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.389
I'm not even trying
to punish Wade.

38:10.489 --> 38:13.392
You know, our breakup was
as much my fault as it was his.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.563
Maybe there's just something
about him that makes you crazy.

38:17.663 --> 38:18.964
Maybe.
(laughs)

38:19.998 --> 38:21.533
But the truth is,

38:21.633 --> 38:25.303
Wade is a great guy
with massive potential

38:25.404 --> 38:27.005
for growth with
the right woman.

38:27.105 --> 38:29.007
What if I'm not
the right woman?

38:29.107 --> 38:30.342
Well, I'm not
telling you to marry him,

38:31.309 --> 38:32.644
and I can't promise
that it's gonna work out,

38:32.744 --> 38:34.613
but did you have
a good time with him?

38:34.713 --> 38:36.548
Yeah.

38:36.648 --> 38:37.549
(giggles)

38:37.649 --> 38:39.585
Maybe you should give him

38:39.685 --> 38:41.553
another chance
to make you crazy.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.455
*

38:53.599 --> 38:57.102
If you still want me to
leave, I'm all packed up.

38:57.202 --> 38:59.505
Do you still want me to leave?

39:01.072 --> 39:02.107
No.

39:02.207 --> 39:04.009
Oh, thank God you said that.

39:04.109 --> 39:06.412
Could you be a doll
and help me unpack?

39:06.512 --> 39:07.413
Oh, sure.

39:07.513 --> 39:08.480
Also, I was thinking

39:09.415 --> 39:10.382
you could move me
into the other bedroom,

39:11.116 --> 39:11.583
the one closer
to the bathroom,

39:12.584 --> 39:13.318
'cause you know how often
I have to go now.

39:13.419 --> 39:16.354
Oh, that's probably
a good idea.

39:16.455 --> 39:17.923
Yeah. And after that,

39:18.023 --> 39:19.558
do you think
it would be possible

39:19.658 --> 39:21.359
to change the lightbulbs
in the hallway?

39:21.460 --> 39:22.628
Those halogen ones
are too bright.

39:22.728 --> 39:23.762
They give me a headache.

39:24.763 --> 39:25.697
Oh, and I think I just might
need a shower chair,

39:26.598 --> 39:27.365
'cause who can stand
with all this weight?

39:27.833 --> 39:28.500
(laughs):
Right?

39:29.401 --> 39:31.403
I know a place in
Mobile that sells them.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.004
I should get a pen.

39:33.104 --> 39:36.442
I'm gonna have to write
all this down.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.477
*

39:42.047 --> 39:43.114
Hey.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.517
Heard the meeting
didn't go so well.

39:45.617 --> 39:47.118
Yeah, it was
kind of like

39:47.218 --> 39:49.721
watching a hockey game
at a Roman forum

39:49.821 --> 39:52.558
on a St. Patrick's Day when they
announce there's no more beer.

39:52.658 --> 39:55.126
Oh, I'm so sorry.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.995
And I'm sure that
Scooter didn't know

39:57.095 --> 39:58.530
everything Fillmore
was planning.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.398
I don't really see
how he couldn't.

40:00.499 --> 40:02.400
But you know what?

40:02.501 --> 40:03.769
It doesn't really
matter anymore, does it?

40:03.869 --> 40:06.104
I don't want to see
this town go away.

40:06.204 --> 40:08.974
So if there is anything
else I can do...

40:09.074 --> 40:12.811
No, Tansy, you went above
and beyond for this, so...

40:12.911 --> 40:14.613
thank you.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.414
*

40:22.554 --> 40:24.490
Only in BlueBell
can an angry mob

40:24.590 --> 40:26.658
be angry and yet
still charming.

40:26.758 --> 40:27.826
I mean, BlueBell
should be allowed

40:27.926 --> 40:29.595
to stay BlueBell
for that reason alone.

40:29.695 --> 40:31.763
Poor Lavon,
he loves this town.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.465
As well he should.

40:33.565 --> 40:34.466
(sighs)

40:35.266 --> 40:37.068
The good news:
fake affair exposed,

40:37.168 --> 40:40.506
at least we can put
the "P" back in "PDA."

40:40.606 --> 40:42.040
Have you been
working on that line?

40:42.140 --> 40:44.510
(laughs): I am
a smooth wordsmith.

40:44.610 --> 40:45.577
(laughs)

40:46.444 --> 40:47.178
I know we're all
worried about the town--

40:47.879 --> 40:48.647
me, too--
but guess what?

40:49.881 --> 40:51.449
Uh, is this a real "guess what"
or are you just gonna tell us?

40:52.584 --> 40:53.084
My teacher knows an editor
at The Huffington Post,

40:53.752 --> 40:54.452
and I pitched her an article

40:55.587 --> 40:56.655
about the murky ethics
of journalism, and she loved it.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.056
I'm calling it

40:58.156 --> 40:59.525
"The Quicksand of Truth."

40:59.625 --> 41:00.826
Evocative.
And if
the article

41:00.926 --> 41:02.227
goes well,
they'll publish it.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.596
I'll be applying to college
as a published writer.

41:04.696 --> 41:07.132
Take that, Percy Lewis
and your dumb symphonies.

41:07.232 --> 41:08.500
All right.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.802
Beer, white wine,

41:10.902 --> 41:12.671
and a Shirley Temple
for the young lady.

41:12.771 --> 41:13.739
We didn't even order.

41:14.606 --> 41:15.741
On the house.
I'm feeling generous.

41:16.575 --> 41:16.875
Take advantage of it
while it lasts.

41:17.676 --> 41:18.510
Then can I get
a white wine, too?

41:19.210 --> 41:19.711
No.
ZOE:
You're in an awful

41:20.812 --> 41:21.647
good mood for someone
who might own a bar in Fillmore.

41:22.548 --> 41:23.214
Well, I got a call
from Cousin Vivian.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.483
Seems she's, uh,
come to her senses.

41:25.584 --> 41:26.484
JOEL:
Are you going out again?

41:26.585 --> 41:28.687
Stud.
Don't do that.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.155
Yep.
Weird, right?

41:30.255 --> 41:32.157
Her calling me back
out of the blue like that?

41:32.257 --> 41:34.159
Ah, women. Go figure.

41:34.259 --> 41:35.160
You two have fun.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.795
I intend to.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.066
That was decent of you.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.834
I don't know what
you're talking about.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.202
Okay.

41:44.302 --> 41:45.904
Hey, where'd my wine go?

41:46.004 --> 41:48.073
What?

41:48.173 --> 41:49.507
All the best
journalists drink.

41:49.608 --> 41:50.642
Everybody knows that.

41:51.577 --> 41:51.910
It's why they call it
the Fourth Estate.

41:52.578 --> 41:54.913
Is that true?
Could be.
