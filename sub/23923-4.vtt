(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:05.705 --> 00:07.739
PIGEON: Okay, do we have
a mystery today or not?

00:07.774 --> 00:11.243
Because if not,
I'm gonna go play golf
with a friend of mine.

00:11.278 --> 00:13.145
-You play golf?
-You have a friend?

00:13.180 --> 00:14.846
I mean, we're friendly,

00:14.881 --> 00:17.482
we're not friends.
Not like I am with you guys.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.351
You guys are my real friends.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.153
I love you all dearly.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.422
You know,
I don't say that enough.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.791
Oh, I forgot.
You guys do have a mystery.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.692
Dear Mike Tyson Mystery Team,

00:27.727 --> 00:30.662
I need your help
locating a missing package.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.932
Signed, Chris Glassman,
Chicago, Illinois.

00:33.967 --> 00:38.503
(SIGHING) All right.
Let me cancel with Marty.

00:38.538 --> 00:42.007
Hey, Marty.
Look, uh, I think golf
is not gonna happen.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.777
I got to solve a mystery
with these assholes
I told you about.

00:45.812 --> 00:48.980
Evidently, this one's
in Chicago.

00:49.015 --> 00:51.783
You too. You too.

00:51.818 --> 00:54.119
Okay. Take care, Marty.

00:54.154 --> 00:57.489
And I'm sorry
about all that shit
with your son, huh.

00:57.524 --> 01:00.092
Okay. To the Mystery Mobile.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.463
So, Chris Glassman,

01:04.498 --> 01:06.698
your note says
that you're missing a package.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.533
Oh, yeah, could you
shut the door, please?

01:08.568 --> 01:12.904
You shut the door,
mother (BLEEP).
I'm Mike Tyson.

01:12.939 --> 01:16.741
Um, I gotta say, I'm relieved
there aren't any women
on the team,

01:16.776 --> 01:18.910
'cause, you know,
this is a little embarrassing,

01:18.945 --> 01:21.546
but since it's just
us guys, we got
a little bro code, yeah?

01:21.581 --> 01:23.715
-I'm a girl.
-(CHUCKLING) That's funny.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.651
You're a funny dude.
You're a funny little dude.

01:26.686 --> 01:29.354
-(SIGHS)
-All right, here's the deal.

01:29.389 --> 01:31.089
I'm an investment banker.

01:31.124 --> 01:33.925
Mergers and acquisitions.
I kick ass.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.927
I'm a hotshot.
I'm a rainmaker.

01:35.962 --> 01:39.364
And I'm trying
to make partner,
so basically all I do is work.

01:39.399 --> 01:42.167
But sometimes, you just got to
blow your load quick.

01:42.202 --> 01:45.403
You know
what I'm saying, guy? (LAUGHS)

01:45.438 --> 01:47.372
You get it, dude.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.241
When you just want
to rub one out fast
and get back to work.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.742
Um, yeah, totally.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.677
Um, so what exactly

01:52.712 --> 01:55.080
does this have to do
with whatever you lost
in the mail?

01:55.115 --> 01:56.748
Okay, here's the deal.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.384
I ordered this thing,
it's like a pocket (BLEEP).

01:59.419 --> 02:01.953
Aw! How darling is that?

02:01.988 --> 02:03.522
A pocket (BLEEP).

02:03.557 --> 02:05.891
Oh! Like a little kitty cat
stuffed animal?

02:05.926 --> 02:09.094
Well, I used to have
a little stuffed kitty
when I was a boy.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.129
I named her Pippa,
Pippa Pussy.

02:11.164 --> 02:13.098
I took her to the school,
to the park.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.267
My mother said
I didn't make many friends

02:15.302 --> 02:17.402
because I was always
petting my (BLEEP).

02:17.437 --> 02:20.639
No, dude.
It's a masturbation sleeve.
You jack off into it.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.274
-Oh, my God!
-Ugh!

02:22.309 --> 02:23.975
And I had it shipped here,
'cause I'm never home.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.545
And it said it got delivered,
but I never got it.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.247
Which means that somewhere
at this very prestigious,

02:29.282 --> 02:31.283
very conservative
investment firm,

02:31.318 --> 02:34.553
is my Faye Thomas
grip-on vagina simulator.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.055
Oh, a Faye Thomas
fan, huh? Ah.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.723
Too many tattoos for me.

02:38.758 --> 02:40.492
On the other hand, she does

02:40.527 --> 02:43.328
a lot of interracial stuff,
which I like.

02:43.363 --> 02:46.431
Is there anyone in here
with a similar name
like yours,

02:46.466 --> 02:48.133
another Chris something?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.834
Or something Glassman?

02:49.869 --> 02:52.404
Maybe it got dropped off
at the wrong office.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.005
-Oh, my God!
-What?

02:54.040 --> 02:55.974
Dude, Christine Grossman.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.509
I bet you
it went to Christine Grossman,

02:57.544 --> 02:59.411
she's one of
the senior partners.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.646
If she opens it
and sees it was for me,
I'm screwed.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.315
I can kiss
making partner goodbye.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.483
Look, well, now,
hold on, hold on.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.620
Even if she did get it
by mistake, there's a chance

03:08.655 --> 03:10.622
she hasn't
opened it yet, right?

03:10.657 --> 03:12.958
We just need
to get into her office
and have a look.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.960
She's always in her office.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.661
She works longer hours
than I do.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.430
Okay. Hold on. I've got it.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.498
What if Mike makes
an appointment with Christine?

03:20.533 --> 03:22.367
He could say, I don't know,

03:22.402 --> 03:24.502
that he wants to invest
some money or whatever
with her.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.005
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I'm listening.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.108
And while they're busy
talking about stocks and bonds
and high yield, this and that,

03:30.143 --> 03:32.444
Pigeon, because you're
so small,

03:32.479 --> 03:35.614
you can just sneak in
and spirit the package away
without her seeing you.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.316
Oh. And while
we're doing that,

03:38.351 --> 03:41.519
you and Yung
go have a nice lunch.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.388
Oh! What a fun idea.

03:43.423 --> 03:45.690
Yung, huh?
Today is my cheat day.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.059
What do you think,
a little deep dish? (CHUCKLES)

03:48.094 --> 03:49.461
We are in Chicago.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.529
(GASPS) Maybe we'll
run into Oprah.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.998
Oh, my God, I would die.

03:53.033 --> 03:57.235
(ENUNCIATING) I would
literally die.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.637
She changed my life.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.973
Yeah, she did.
November 15th, 1988,

04:02.008 --> 04:03.908
when she wheeled
that wagon on stage

04:03.943 --> 04:06.511
filled with 67 pounds of fat,

04:06.546 --> 04:08.880
all the weight
she had lost that year,
it was...

04:08.915 --> 04:11.916
I'm sorry,
my light-bulb moment.

04:11.951 --> 04:13.485
Do any of you

04:13.520 --> 04:16.187
know what I looked like
in 1988?

04:16.222 --> 04:19.858
I was 400 pounds,
and I was house-bound,
and I was depressed.

04:19.893 --> 04:23.762
(SOBBING) And that episode
of<i> Oprah</i> changed my life.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.331
And I keep this photo
to remind me

04:26.366 --> 04:28.033
of where I've been

04:28.068 --> 04:29.901
and where I will
never go again.

04:29.936 --> 04:30.936
(SNIFFLES)

04:31.571 --> 04:32.571
Okay.

04:33.473 --> 04:34.839
Yeah, let's do this.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.274
Let's get some deep dish.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.943
I'm gonna munch on
some pie today.

04:38.978 --> 04:41.780
Mr. Tyson,
I want to first thank you
for considering our firm,

04:41.815 --> 04:43.748
and I wanna say that
we take the responsibility

04:43.783 --> 04:46.584
of financial stewardship
very seriously.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.219
That's good
to hear, Christine.

04:48.254 --> 04:49.854
That sets my mind at ease.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.289
And although we are
an old firm

04:51.324 --> 04:53.058
with a conservative
investment approach,

04:53.093 --> 04:55.593
I can also assure you
we are on the cutting edge

04:55.628 --> 04:59.030
when it comes to the more
esoteric financial products.

04:59.065 --> 05:01.199
We use proprietary
AI algorithms

05:01.234 --> 05:03.435
to give our clients
the greatest advantage.

05:03.470 --> 05:07.272
Christine, you had me
at proprietary AI algorithm.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.608
May I ask who is currently
handling your finances?

05:10.643 --> 05:12.711
-Deezy.
-I'm sorry?

05:12.746 --> 05:13.812
Deezy.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.146
No last name.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.915
Maybe that is his last name,

05:16.950 --> 05:18.983
I don't know,
but he's got all my money.

05:19.018 --> 05:22.053
And roughly how much money
would you want us
to manage for you?

05:22.088 --> 05:24.589
Off the top of my head,
I'd say tons,

05:24.624 --> 05:26.925
but that's really
a question for Deezy.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.794
Let's call him right now,
shall we?

05:29.763 --> 05:32.397
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

<i>with your voice, man,</i>
<i>are you asleep?</i>

05:38.772 --> 05:40.572
Am I asleep in your bed? No!

05:40.607 --> 05:42.741
I am asleep in my room,
in the Pigeon coop.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.909
I mean, I'm not asleep,
it's the middle of the day.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.945
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
I'm in the office.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.747
I'm negotiating
on your behalf.
I'm making that money, Mike.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.815
Oh, good, good.
That's why I was calling.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.650
I'm in a meeting right now
with this lady,

05:52.685 --> 05:55.186
and she's gonna ask you
a bunch of money questions.

05:55.221 --> 05:56.755
Christine, go ahead.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.090
You're on with Deezy.
Tell him about the AI.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.825
Hello, Mr. Deezy.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.927
DEEZY:<i> Hello, Ms. Christine.</i>
PIGEON: (SOFTLY) Mike.

06:02.962 --> 06:04.629
Mike, I got it.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.598
I'm trying to get an overall
financial picture here,

06:06.633 --> 06:09.834
so we can decide
on an appropriate
initial investment.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.137
DEEZY:<i> Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.</i>
<i>That sounds good.</i>

06:12.172 --> 06:14.205
So what is that picture?

06:14.240 --> 06:18.143
Um, that picture is, um...
Well, well, of course,
it's very robust,

06:19.813 --> 06:22.380

Hello, we got your dumb
jack-off toy.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.227
Where the (BLEEP) is this guy?

07:09.262 --> 07:11.696
I solved the (BLEEP) mystery,
where the (BLEEP)
is everybody?

07:11.731 --> 07:14.199
I missed golf with Marty
for this. Marty!

07:14.234 --> 07:18.102
Disrespectful. That's what
this is, disrespectful.

07:18.137 --> 07:19.771
What am I supposed to do?

07:19.806 --> 07:23.308
Just sit here, wait around,
like a bump on a log?

07:25.478 --> 07:28.012
Maybe we have a look
at this Faye Thomas

07:28.047 --> 07:30.315
grip-on vagina simulator.

07:31.484 --> 07:34.285
Maybe we just have a look.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.020
I am disappointed, Christine.

07:36.055 --> 07:38.022
Where are the arms?
Where are the legs?

07:38.057 --> 07:40.525
AI means
"artificial intelligence,"

07:40.560 --> 07:42.961
and artificial intelligence
means robots.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.730
I'm afraid
you will not be getting
any of my tons of money,

07:45.765 --> 07:47.432
even if Deezy finds it.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.133
And I don't think he will.

Good day, Christine.

you like that, huh?
You want that? You want that?

07:58.144 --> 07:59.444
You want that in your (BLEEP)?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.779
Want that
in your (BLEEP), huh?

08:01.814 --> 08:03.047
Well, here I (BLEEP)!

08:07.954 --> 08:09.454
Hello. Hey, hey.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.955
Uh, listen.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.725
Good news.
Your boss never saw this.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.327
Bad news,
I just (BLEEP) in it,

08:16.362 --> 08:19.898
and here's the thing
about bird (BLEEP).

08:19.933 --> 08:21.566
It's malodorous.

08:21.601 --> 08:24.302
Uh, it's also very thick.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.770
Thicker than you'd think.

08:25.805 --> 08:28.640
It's like a waxy syrup,
like sap.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.342
But really, it's that odor

08:31.377 --> 08:34.078
that sets it apart
from other (BLEEP).

08:34.113 --> 08:37.649
It's impossible to remove
from any surface,
did you know that?

08:37.684 --> 08:39.851
So you probably
don't want this one anymore.

08:39.886 --> 08:42.921
I think maybe we
throw it away.

Hey, don't throw that away
in here, you asshole.

and you call me an "asshole"?
