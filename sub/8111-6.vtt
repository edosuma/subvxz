WEBVTT

00:02.378 --> 00:04.243
Okay, boys and girls.

00:04.839 --> 00:07.455
Guess what kind of animal
Wacky Benny's making now.

00:07.842 --> 00:09.127
Give you a big hint.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.255
(GROWING)

00:17.101 --> 00:18.136
(CHILDREN TITTERING)

00:18.227 --> 00:20.058
Is it a dead animal?

00:22.607 --> 00:25.849
I say we put him
out of his misery
and bring out Emma's cake.

00:26.485 --> 00:29.443
He's so new to this.
How's he gonna learn
if we stop his act?

00:29.530 --> 00:30.861
You're a sucky clown.

00:31.908 --> 00:34.570
And you're
a super-duper audience.

00:38.748 --> 00:39.954
Hey, that is not okay.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.577
Hey, keep your
hands off my son!

00:41.667 --> 00:44.249
Tell him to keep
his hands off me.

00:53.304 --> 00:55.636
I can't move my arm or leg.

01:28.631 --> 01:31.794
So how does a completely
heathteenagerhave
a mini-stroke?

01:31.884 --> 01:34.091
Head CT and cerebral
angiogram are normal,

01:34.220 --> 01:36.427
clotting parameters
are normal.

01:36.514 --> 01:39.176
You're forgetting
the wrinkly clump
in the middle of his shirt.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.305
Thought we'd diagnose
the middle-aged clown first.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.227
It's probably
from my seatbelt.

01:45.314 --> 01:46.520
Wrinkle pattern's too varied.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.563
Looks like someone shoved
you. Or grabbed you.

01:48.651 --> 01:50.812
Probably from the diaper bag.
If the patient's using drugs,

01:50.903 --> 01:53.235
cocaine could've caused
an arterial
spasm in his brain...

01:53.322 --> 01:54.482
Tox screen's clean.

01:54.573 --> 01:57.736
I'm gonna say it
was the ex-girlfriend
you cheated on,

01:57.827 --> 01:59.488
not the ex-wife
you cheated with

01:59.578 --> 02:00.954
because if the latter
was prone to violence,

02:01.038 --> 02:05.077
you'd have been scattered
in various
dumpsters years ago.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.124
Seriously?

02:08.796 --> 02:11.082
No one else wants to
talk about the patient?

02:11.173 --> 02:13.915
New office furniture.
Meaty topic.

02:14.010 --> 02:15.625
What's the action
on the ex-wife?

02:17.847 --> 02:19.428
It was Rachel's
boyfriend Phil.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.176
His company's moving
him back to Portland.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.015
He wants me to
change my visitation order

02:23.102 --> 02:26.765
so he can ask
Rachel and my daughter
to move out west with him.

02:26.856 --> 02:28.221
Things got a little heated.

02:30.234 --> 02:32.350
The patient was
punched in the groin,

02:32.445 --> 02:35.232
could've triggered a massive
sympathetic discharge...

02:35.323 --> 02:36.733
Carotid duplex is normal.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.065
And who's better
qualified to be the daddy?

02:39.160 --> 02:42.027
The guy who
spilled a little DNA
in her gene pool,

02:42.121 --> 02:43.702
or the guy
who's gonna be there
day and night

02:43.789 --> 02:48.283
to pass on important values
like not shtupping
Mommy after the divorce?

02:48.377 --> 02:51.961
I am her daddy.
She's staying here.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.832
A couple nights
a week with each kid
may make you feel better.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.757
It doesn't replace
two round-the-clock parents.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.302
Round-the-clock or not,
parenting's an impossible job.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.129
No way not to mess it up.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.007
Why shouldn't Taub
be the one to do it?

03:04.727 --> 03:06.137
Thank you.
HOUSE: Makes sense.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.970
Park's tiger mom and dad
were so insufferable,

03:09.065 --> 03:11.226
she has to measure
their affection in hours.

03:11.317 --> 03:14.775
Chase's careerist dad
and alcoholic mom
were so indifferent,

03:14.862 --> 03:16.193
he has to believe it's a wash.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.315
Your turn.

03:17.448 --> 03:18.858
What did your
screwed-up parents do

03:18.991 --> 03:20.401
to screw up your
view of parenting?

03:21.744 --> 03:23.234
They were good parents.

03:23.329 --> 03:24.990
That's an oxymoron.

03:25.081 --> 03:27.743
Chase is right,
all parents screw
up all children.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.824
He's also dreamy,
but it's not relevant now.

03:29.919 --> 03:31.750
TAUB: So all parents
screw up all children,

03:31.837 --> 03:33.668
but it makes
some huge difference

03:33.798 --> 03:35.629
if I keep my daughter
here or let her move?

03:36.050 --> 03:38.757
Endocarditis,
flipped a piece of
vegetation into his brain,

03:38.844 --> 03:40.505
which could've broken up
before the angiogram.

03:41.597 --> 03:43.679
Transesophageal
echo to confirm.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.056
And screwed up
is her best-case.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.600
Bouncing between
a philandering, workaholic dad

03:48.687 --> 03:51.349
and an embittered,
sexually-betrayed mom,

03:51.440 --> 03:53.101
it's gonna lead to
screwed-up squared.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.477
ls endocarditis treatable?

03:57.613 --> 03:58.819
Very.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.363
The echo will show us
any growths on
his heart valve.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.567
Most likely meds'll be enough,
he won't even need surgery.

04:04.954 --> 04:08.412
He's just taken up
performing, and it's very
stressful for him.

04:09.125 --> 04:10.205
Could that have caused this?

04:10.292 --> 04:12.203
It's not stressful,
l have fun.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.420
Stress wouldn't be relevant.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.916
But anything that
increases his adrenaline
could have made it worse.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.295
Maybe we find you a new hobby.
One you're a little better at.

04:21.470 --> 04:25.588
I'm gonna get better at it,
and it's not a hobby.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.132
I think I want to
get a job working

04:28.269 --> 04:30.134
as a circus clown,
making people laugh.

04:32.982 --> 04:35.644
Ben, I don't think
that's a good idea.

04:35.734 --> 04:36.940
It was good enough for my dad.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.572
You were a...

04:40.698 --> 04:42.108
His biological father.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.155
Could his dad's
melanoma be a factor here?

04:44.243 --> 04:46.359
That wouldn't be related.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.027
Ben, you barely knew him.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.158
You're such a smart kid,

04:50.291 --> 04:54.534
you could aim a lot higher
than face paint
and seltzer bottles.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.876
I need treatment for
my Type 2 diabetes.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.126
There is absolutely
no part of that
sentence that is true.

05:04.221 --> 05:07.088
I've been
experiencing weight gain,
fatigue and sluggishness.

05:07.725 --> 05:10.137
Weight loss is
a symptom of diabetes.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.763
Faﬂgueis
a symptom of
thinking you

05:11.896 --> 05:13.432
have a disease you
don't actually have.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.979
And sluggishness is
a synonym of fatigue.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.193
I need insulin. I know it.

05:18.277 --> 05:21.690
Much as I'd like to kill
you by dangerously
lowering your blood sugar,

05:21.780 --> 05:23.566
murder violates my parole.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.399
That blood work
is weeks old.
Test me again.

05:26.494 --> 05:29.236
I am the test.
The test is negative.

05:29.747 --> 05:32.238
The test also thinks
you're a giant
pain in the ass.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.955
That last insult
was your cue to leave.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.246
Test me.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.250
Fine. Wait right here.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.089
Thank you.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.761
Sleep study.
Please make sure he's

05:51.894 --> 05:53.634
not disturbed for
the next eight hours.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.394
We need to talk
about Saturday night.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.435
No,no,no,no,no.

05:59.318 --> 06:02.731
Historians will talk of
Saturday night, not us.

06:02.821 --> 06:06.655
The legendary
night on which we watch
Santos shatter Rubio's jaw

06:06.784 --> 06:08.570
and you epically pay me $50.

06:08.661 --> 06:10.947
l have a chance
to really watch it.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.324
A patient of mine
has a pair of
tickets he can't use.

06:13.457 --> 06:18.076
And obviously
you're under house
and office arrest,

06:18.170 --> 06:20.331
I just wanted to
make sure you were cool

06:20.464 --> 06:22.625
if I go to
Atlantic City
without you.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.047
No, thanks.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.920
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to decline your invitation

06:26.011 --> 06:27.967
to not spend
Saturday night with you.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.462
These are ringside seats.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.305
Cameras are ringside, too.

06:32.977 --> 06:34.968
If you want,
I could sweat and spit

06:35.145 --> 06:37.101
and bleed on you
from time to time.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.804
I'd take you if I could.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.522
Well, I'd take me if
either of us could.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.774
See what a tough spot I'm in?

06:42.903 --> 06:44.404
I'm going to that fight.

06:46.532 --> 06:48.488
All right,
I'll take the
other ticket.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.075
Let me worry about logistics.

07:01.338 --> 07:04.205
Patient's heart
valves are normal.
It's not endocarditis.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.423
But he has
a thickened pericardium,
which makes no sense.

07:06.510 --> 07:10.378
He has a heart problem,
but not one that
could've caused his TlA.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.175
Syphilitic vasculitis
would explain the TlA

07:12.349 --> 07:14.010
and the pericardial
inflammation.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.218
Syph test was negative.
Plus, the kid's never
been sexually active.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.517
Yeah, I got that from
the line on his chart
that says "birthday clown".

07:20.608 --> 07:22.189
His late father
was a circus clown.

07:22.693 --> 07:23.853
Histoplasmosis.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.101
HOUSE:
He's not immunocompromised.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.060
And I assume you added
that irrelevant tidbit

07:27.197 --> 07:29.324
because you're moved
by the son's idiotic tribute,

07:29.408 --> 07:31.694
and think it justifies
keeping your daughter
in New Jersey.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.491
But what if he has
a heightened immune system.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.865
I mentioned it because...

07:38.542 --> 07:41.204
Take your time.
We'll continue with medicine.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.035
Sjogren's could've
given him chronic

07:43.172 --> 07:44.878
pericarditis and
cerebral arteritis.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.707
Sjogren's it is.
N immunosuppressants
to treat.

07:50.054 --> 07:51.885
Anything?

07:53.223 --> 07:55.555
This'll calm
your immune system.

07:55.726 --> 07:58.058
You should be out of
here within the week.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.682
My mom'll be
happy to hear that.

08:00.773 --> 08:03.059
I've got an internship
that starts in three weeks.

08:03.609 --> 08:05.941
I take it it's not at
a place with a big top.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.565
It's in my stepdad's
law office.

08:11.075 --> 08:13.236
I know I'm not any
good at being a clown yet,

08:14.495 --> 08:16.611
but when I do get a laugh,

08:17.665 --> 08:18.905
see those kids' eyes light up,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.242
that's how my dad made
me feel when l was a kid.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.162
You need to hang onto that.

08:27.675 --> 08:28.664
(SIGHS)

08:28.842 --> 08:32.255
My mom says he
was a loving father,

08:32.388 --> 08:35.755
but always broke and
always on the road.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.757
It's a stupid way
to make a living.

08:39.937 --> 08:42.974
You're 16.
Plenty of time
to make money.

08:44.483 --> 08:47.065
Wanting to build
a connection with your dad,

08:47.194 --> 08:49.776
pass on some of
the joy that he gave you,

08:50.614 --> 08:52.445
that's not stupid at all.

08:55.619 --> 08:56.984
I got it.

09:03.168 --> 09:07.582
(STUTTERS) Is this because
of the medication?
Is it normal?

09:12.970 --> 09:16.508
It's not normal,
and it's not degren's.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.812
TlA, thickened
pericardium, and now

09:25.941 --> 09:28.227
he's bleeding from
his nose and mouth.

09:30.821 --> 09:32.027
What are you doing with her?

09:32.740 --> 09:33.980
"Her"?

09:34.825 --> 09:39.159
Surely this
little bundle of fun
has an actual name.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.410
lt's Sophie.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.617
She's Sophie.
The other one's Sophia.

09:47.421 --> 09:48.706
It's different enough.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.663
They actually have
two completely
different derivations.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.208
No, they don't.

09:55.387 --> 09:58.504
I wasn't in a strong
negotiating position.
Why is she here?

09:58.599 --> 10:01.591
Ruby dropped her off.
Seemed pretty upset.

10:01.685 --> 10:04.017
Apparently someone forgot
that it was Daddy's night.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.514
She wasn't even
gonna leave her

10:05.689 --> 10:07.099
till I said that l was
letting you off early.

10:07.191 --> 10:10.479
Damn it. ljust
started back on the team.
My schedule's a mess.

10:10.903 --> 10:12.518
If your own kids
are a scheduling item,

10:12.654 --> 10:14.269
maybe you should
let one of them move.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.735
Patient has low platelets,
makes me think DIC.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.033
(BABY SQUEALS)
HOUSE: She doesn't seem
to like that idea.

10:20.120 --> 10:24.534
You're right.
No schistocytes
in his smear.

10:24.875 --> 10:28.743
He also has a low red count.
What if it's
a retroperitoneal bleed?

10:28.837 --> 10:29.917
No Grey-Turner's sign.

10:30.005 --> 10:32.792
She wasn't fussy like that
when lwas holding her.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.419
Maybe she likes
the sound of my voice.

10:34.510 --> 10:38.674
Which is weird because
I have no genetic
connection to her.

10:39.807 --> 10:42.890
Could it be she
doesn't know the difference?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.591
So many children of your own,

10:44.686 --> 10:45.971
no wonder you have
such insight into

10:46.104 --> 10:47.389
my relationship
with my babies.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.769
Good point.
How could I comprehend
that you're too despised

10:50.859 --> 10:52.360
to keep them from
having the same name,

10:52.444 --> 10:54.526
too overwhelmed
to remember your own calendar,

10:54.613 --> 10:56.228
and too vain to
admit that at this stage,

10:56.365 --> 10:57.980
you don't matter
to either baby?

11:00.035 --> 11:01.616
Low white count
suggests infection.

11:03.539 --> 11:06.201
What if you're all right?
Low platelets,
plus low red count,

11:06.291 --> 11:07.542
plus low white count equals...

11:07.668 --> 11:08.908
Aplastic anemia.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.254
Kid needs a bone
marrow transplant.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.250
Everyone except
Adams transfuse

11:14.424 --> 11:16.506
his platelets till
you find a match.

11:23.392 --> 11:26.350
You started
college a semester late

11:26.436 --> 11:29.394
because you left high
school a semester late

11:29.481 --> 11:33.941
because you had
five incompletes
in yourjunior year.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.767
And you're
offering one bad semester

11:35.904 --> 11:37.610
as proof that my
parents screwed me up?

11:37.698 --> 11:39.939
Did okay before that,
straight A's after that.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.864
I went through
a rebellious phase.

11:41.952 --> 11:45.570
Don't tell me.
Mom and Dad were at
each other's throats,

11:45.664 --> 11:48.906
and the academic
crisis was a cry for help.

11:50.878 --> 11:54.621
Sorry to mess
with your world view,
but I'm not messed up.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.501
So my parents
couldn't have
messed me up.

11:58.176 --> 12:01.213
Mom's HLA is only
a 3/6 match.

12:01.305 --> 12:03.341
Maternal
grandmother's
worse than that.

12:03.432 --> 12:04.763
Where'd you
unload the baby?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.223
Maternity ward. Shut up.

12:06.310 --> 12:09.427
You realize you're making
House's argument for him.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.728
The part where he said
any parent who uses day care

12:11.815 --> 12:13.396
should ship their
child across the country?

12:13.775 --> 12:15.686
No, the part where he said
that baby doesn't need you.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.278
You've only got her
a couple days a week,

12:17.362 --> 12:19.569
and most of that's spent
with a rotating
cast of nurses...

12:19.656 --> 12:21.612
That's how Daddy likes
to spend his time, too.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.656
Shut up.
First cousin's also a whiff.

12:24.536 --> 12:27.699
So much for
genetics mattering.
I'll try the marrow registry.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.704
TAUB: Dr. Park is
searching the registry.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.206
Transfusing his platelets
will keep him
healthy while we wait.

12:35.297 --> 12:37.458
You sure there's no one
on the father's
side of the family?

12:37.549 --> 12:40.006
If one of them's a match,
that'd speed things up a lot.

(SIGHS) His parents
died young,
he was an only child.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.845
There's no living
relatives that I know of.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.048
Something will turn up soon.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.973
How soon is soon?
Will he miss a lot of school?

12:49.061 --> 12:50.801
I'm actually thinking
ofjust getting my GED.

12:52.898 --> 12:54.934
How do you expect
to get into a good college?

12:55.025 --> 12:59.359
I'm gonna take classes
on magic, juggling,
try to make a go of this.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.108
Ben, you keep your grades up,
you can do
anything in the world.

13:02.199 --> 13:05.157
Like what?
Work in some
boring office?

13:05.243 --> 13:07.950
Do you think my
father would have
done that for 10 minutes?

13:08.038 --> 13:09.778
You don't
remember your father.
You don't know...

13:09.873 --> 13:12.364
I want to build
a connection with him.

13:13.001 --> 13:16.334
Pass on some of
the joy that he gave me.

13:35.315 --> 13:39.058
Sorry. Since you paged me,
I didn't want to
keep you waiting.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.734
Yeah. I paged you,
which means you're next.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.904
That's cool. I'll wait.

13:44.491 --> 13:48.154
That's a good start.
Let's go through
it point by point.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.323
First up...

13:54.167 --> 13:55.373
I'll call you back.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.586
Just got this.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.459
The American Association
of Rheumatology

14:02.551 --> 14:06.169
wants you to speak, 9:00,
Saturday, in Atlantic City.

14:06.513 --> 14:10.005
Dr. Neusinger canceled on them
at the last minute.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.560
I hate conferences.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.679
Well, this is a big one.
And it's the premium slot.

14:17.315 --> 14:18.976
I'd like you to do it.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.603
l'll clear it with
your parole officer.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.068
What do I need to do for you?

14:26.533 --> 14:29.741
Halve the clinic hours
that you recently doubled,

14:29.828 --> 14:33.571
and double the hooker budget
that you recently halved.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.994
I think you refer
to it as petty cash.

14:38.420 --> 14:39.580
Fine.

14:42.007 --> 14:45.545
Just one thing.
I'm gonna ask them
to put you on in the morning.

14:45.761 --> 14:48.002
We're doing them a favor.
Why should you have
to spend the night?

14:48.805 --> 14:51.592
But you said that 9:00
was the premium slot.

I've earned my hookers.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.805
The place'll be a madhouse.

14:56.897 --> 15:00.640
Especially since it's 2 miles
from the Rubio fight,
at the exact same time.

15:01.985 --> 15:05.853
Nice try. You called up,
pretended to be Neusinger,
canceled,

15:05.947 --> 15:07.403
then suggested
yourself as a replacement.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.861
You go to that fight,
you go to prison.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.608
Well, that'd be redundant

15:11.703 --> 15:15.287
when l have an angry black guy
waiting for me to
drop the soap right here.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.285
Better go do some
of those clinic hours
I recently doubled.

15:24.216 --> 15:25.752
Test my urine.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.675
Looks like I was
wrong about my diagnosis.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.460
Yeah. I have diabetes.

15:30.555 --> 15:33.592
No. But you're
not a hypochondriac.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.139
Or you'd have imagined
some new disease

15:35.268 --> 15:36.769
after I shot
down the first one.

15:37.229 --> 15:40.266
So whose urine is that?
Diabetic girlfriend
without health insurance?

15:40.357 --> 15:44.191
It's not a scam, I'm sick.
Now l have swollen ankles.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.188
The medical term is cankles.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.104
Is there some
black market in insulin
that I don't know about?

15:49.199 --> 15:50.689
It's in my genes.

15:50.784 --> 15:55.118
My old man got diabetes at 50,
my older brother got it
at 50, ljust turned 50.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.867
Well, that's a great argument
if diabetes was a gold watch.

15:57.999 --> 16:02.459
I've got sciatica
like my dad, class-four
hemorrhoids like him.

Dad has no living relatives.

16:14.558 --> 16:16.219
It's been years since he died.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.358
If the kid's dad
died young of melanoma,

16:28.738 --> 16:30.194
how come the
overprotective mom

16:30.323 --> 16:31.824
never took him to
a dermatologist?

16:31.908 --> 16:33.159
Are you gonna test
my urine, or what?

16:47.924 --> 16:49.209
Not diabetes.

16:50.427 --> 16:51.837
Use crossmatched platelets,

16:51.928 --> 16:54.260

the patient some blood
that's closer to his own.

detail on the exact type
of melanoma his father had...

Otherwise we might not be able
to find a marrow match.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.043
How did he die?

He didn't.

keep this from me?

You're trying to deflect.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.371
Now you are.

You have to believe
that every parent
screws up every child,

18:48.878 --> 18:50.960
or you were screwed
out of a decent childhood.

18:51.047 --> 18:53.424

was also

18:53.550 --> 18:55.916

with my married mom.

give up. Just tell him
about your parents.

she couldn't handle me,

make it legally.

come to the door

Easy peasy.

23:29.367 --> 23:31.574
More likely the patient
has a hyperammonemic problem.

23:31.661 --> 23:33.242
His liver's not
cleaning out his blood,

23:33.371 --> 23:34.907
the buildup of toxins
is causing everything.

23:34.998 --> 23:36.784
l'm defending the dad
because he got screwed.

23:36.874 --> 23:38.660
After he lost his son,
he lost his job,

23:38.835 --> 23:40.621

gave up clowning.

23:40.712 --> 23:42.873

23:43.006 --> 23:44.246
I say we tell the kid.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.126
He's a minor,
the mom's his guardian,

23:46.259 --> 23:47.999
and it's not even
medically relevant.

23:48.136 --> 23:49.751
She robbed them of
12 years together.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.383
Or she ripped off
the Band-Aid too late.

23:52.515 --> 23:55.427
That memory she let
Son of Bozo establish

23:55.518 --> 23:58.851
is making him
chase his father's
moronic profession.

23:58.980 --> 24:02.347
When he could be
living the high
life in Portland.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.357

metaphorically, of course.

are reluctant to hire ex-cons.

24:26.549 --> 24:27.709
Well, what about the patient?

24:28.593 --> 24:30.549
Is the problem
hyperammonemic
or synthetic?

24:30.678 --> 24:31.758
CHASE: Can't treat for both.

24:31.888 --> 24:34.550
One requires hemodialysis,
the other a liver transplant

24:34.682 --> 24:36.058
and we couldn't
even get the kid
a marrow match.

24:36.184 --> 24:38.345
Get the mom's consent
to pump him full of protein.

24:38.436 --> 24:40.267
If it's a synthetic
problem, more fluid

24:40.396 --> 24:42.227
will leak into his chest
and his heart will fail.

24:42.357 --> 24:44.097
If it's hyperammonemic,
toxins will

24:44.233 --> 24:45.973
oven/vhelm his body and
he'll go into a coma.

24:46.069 --> 24:48.151
Do you only like tests
that involve
the risk of death?

24:48.237 --> 24:52.731

less conclusive tests,
but why take that risk?

TAUB: There are
very serious risks,

25:19.644 --> 25:23.978
but if we don't
figure out what he has,
we can't treat him at all.

25:31.781 --> 25:33.817
I may be a little
out of bounds here,

25:33.950 --> 25:35.360
but in case there
are complications,

25:35.451 --> 25:38.443
might be a good time
to come clean to your son.

25:40.998 --> 25:42.124
A little out of bounds?

25:42.625 --> 25:46.618
I don't know the history,
but everyone makes mistakes.

25:46.754 --> 25:47.789
Your son worships him.

25:47.922 --> 25:48.957
The doctor's right about that.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.331
Yeah?

25:51.467 --> 25:52.752
And when did he learn that?

25:52.844 --> 25:54.675
When he encouraged Ben
to drop out of school?

25:56.973 --> 26:00.465
Mitchell is not Ben's father
any more than a sperm
donor would've been.

you in the clinic.
Wants treatment for diabetes.

My condolences
on your forthcoming divorce.

26:19.787 --> 26:21.323
He keeps imagining symptoms,

26:21.456 --> 26:25.449
and now l have to
make him these awful
anti-diabetic meals.

26:25.543 --> 26:27.909
Since I have no
intention of testing him,

26:28.045 --> 26:30.457
treating him,
or cooking for him...

26:31.841 --> 26:35.049
Could you write
me a fake
prescription for insulin?

26:35.678 --> 26:36.963
The advantage of
fake prescriptions

26:37.054 --> 26:39.181
is you don't have
to be a real doctor
to write one.

26:39.307 --> 26:41.719
Just tell me what's safe
to inject in his thigh.

26:42.560 --> 26:47.224
His symptoms will go away
and then I can show
him he was never sick.

till he camps out
on your parents' lawn,

admit you don't live

eye back in place

to keep Dad away,

you can't go either.

that he would like to say.

32:04.173 --> 32:06.459
So I thought that he
should say it in person.

move to Portland?

something like this

Bok choy has glucosinolates,

function and account for

35:07.856 --> 35:09.016
What the hell
are you doing here?

35:09.149 --> 35:11.356
l was told this
might be my last chance
to see my son.

35:12.194 --> 35:14.355
You had no right.
This is none of
your business!

35:14.446 --> 35:15.526
I didn't...
I called him.

35:16.949 --> 35:19.281
This man is Ben's hero.
Let them spend
five minutes together.

35:22.204 --> 35:23.785
No. You get out of here!

35:30.713 --> 35:31.793
Wait.

35:38.012 --> 35:40.219
You sexually
molested your son.

35:40.973 --> 35:43.385
Your walk, tabes dorsalis.

35:43.976 --> 35:45.841
You have late-stage syphilis.

35:46.395 --> 35:49.728
Which you gave to our patient,
presumably 12 years ago.

35:49.815 --> 35:53.228
Which also explains why Mom
is not big on family reunions.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.398
I shouldn't be here.

36:06.081 --> 36:09.323
We tested him for syphilis,
he was negative.

36:09.418 --> 36:13.036
HOUSE: After 12 years,
the active infection
would have died down

36:13.714 --> 36:15.420
everywhere except
the arteries in his brain,

36:15.591 --> 36:17.331
where it could hide
out from our tests.

36:17.426 --> 36:21.419
When that six-year-old
heckler punched him in
hisjuggling pins,

36:21.555 --> 36:24.262
it kicked up
the dormant bacteria
in his pelvis.

36:24.391 --> 36:27.428
The immunosuppressants
we gave him
sent it into overdrive.

36:27.519 --> 36:31.011
The antibiotics we gave him
actually started
destroying the syphilis.

36:31.106 --> 36:33.392
But like pouring
water on a fire,

36:33.525 --> 36:35.777
led to a trail of
toxic smoke and ash,

36:35.903 --> 36:38.110
which made his immune system
overcompensate.

36:38.238 --> 36:40.729
Severe Jarisch-Herxheimer
reaction.

36:41.450 --> 36:42.940
Is this true?
HOUSE: Yes.

36:43.077 --> 36:45.944
Jarisch-Herxheimer is real.
It sounds silly but...

36:46.789 --> 36:48.950
You mean the... Right.

36:54.254 --> 36:56.631
I found stains on his clothes.

36:58.133 --> 36:59.464
(SlGHS DEEPLY)

37:00.135 --> 37:04.378
He didn't understand
and he didn't
seem traumatized.

37:05.224 --> 37:09.718
I kept trying to talk
to him, but before long,
he'd forgotten.

37:09.812 --> 37:11.552
And he seemed...

37:12.564 --> 37:14.976
He seemed happy,
and he seemed normal.

37:15.067 --> 37:16.523
So you made Daddy
go away, and you made

37:16.652 --> 37:18.142
sure Junior had no
reason to go looking.

37:20.614 --> 37:22.479
l was just
trying to protect him,

37:23.492 --> 37:26.655
like I should have
done from the start.

37:28.330 --> 37:30.821
(SOBS) I'm sorry.

37:33.001 --> 37:37.586
HOUSE: lV penicillin and
anti-TNF antibodies,
he'll be fine.

37:37.673 --> 37:40.460
Apart from the whole
daddy-rape thing.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.181
We're not done.

37:50.269 --> 37:51.930
No, we are not.

37:52.020 --> 37:55.353
Notify the dad's
sexual partners,
notify his employer,

37:55.482 --> 37:57.438
his landlord,
notify the police.

37:57.526 --> 38:01.018
I meant the kid.
We're not gonna tell
him he was molested?

38:01.113 --> 38:03.604
To make him miserable,
or to forfeit your license?

38:03.699 --> 38:05.781
To tell him the truth.

38:05.868 --> 38:08.280
He's a virgin,
how do I explain
the STD?

38:08.370 --> 38:11.282
It's a medical diagnosis.
Screw the parents,
the kid's our patient.

38:11.373 --> 38:15.286
I guess Taub's
got a tough choice
to make when the kid wakes up.

38:15.377 --> 38:16.583
Why is it my choice?

38:16.712 --> 38:17.952
Because you're a dad.

38:18.046 --> 38:20.378
How could the rest of us
possibly understand?

38:30.809 --> 38:32.049
What was wrong with me?

38:35.689 --> 38:36.895
It's called syphilis.

38:38.901 --> 38:39.890
Uh...

38:40.819 --> 38:42.650
You can get that
without having sex?

38:56.335 --> 38:57.575
I didn't tell him.

39:01.048 --> 39:02.663
Your heart said
he needed to know,

39:02.758 --> 39:06.046
your brain knew he's
better off without it.

39:07.679 --> 39:10.421
Following your heart is easy.
Following your brain is tough.

39:11.058 --> 39:13.094
Especially after
years of following

39:13.268 --> 39:15.350
that much smaller,
third organ.

39:16.772 --> 39:20.765
That's why all parents
screw up all children.

39:28.617 --> 39:29.948
Evening.

39:35.123 --> 39:38.957
Clever tactic,
pretending you're not
interested anymore.

39:40.796 --> 39:43.754
How could that
possibly work as a tactic?

39:44.424 --> 39:46.210
The fact is,
once I saw
those incompletes,

39:46.343 --> 39:48.129
I knew your parents
screwed you up.

39:48.262 --> 39:50.093
The details are just gravy.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.641
You're wrong.

39:54.476 --> 39:58.139
The only evidence you have
is proof of something else.

39:59.982 --> 40:01.938
I ran away from home.

40:04.778 --> 40:07.611
Because you had
lousy parents.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.650
Because I didn't.

40:11.159 --> 40:16.404
All my friends'
parents were divorced,
or having affairs,

40:16.498 --> 40:19.331
or barely knew
their kids' birthdays.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.494
You envied
their dysfunction?

40:25.591 --> 40:28.833
I thought it made
them deeper somehow.

40:33.807 --> 40:35.513
It was stupid.

40:35.684 --> 40:39.677
l hitchhiked to Manhattan,
moved in with an older guy.

40:39.813 --> 40:42.520
In two months I
came running home.

40:42.649 --> 40:45.356
Took my parents
years to get over it.

40:47.029 --> 40:51.523
That's when you started
to excel. You were making
it up to them.

40:53.702 --> 40:56.364
Your parents screwed you up
by not screwing you up.

40:57.372 --> 41:00.614
How does briefly
wishing lwas screwed up
make me screwed up?

41:02.377 --> 41:06.040
It's normal to be screwed up.
It's really screwed
up to romanticize it.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.797
Guess that's why
you wanted to
work with prisoners.

41:12.054 --> 41:14.636
It's why I wanted
to work with you.

41:19.895 --> 41:21.556
It was a tactic.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.579
Chris.
Yeah.

41:41.708 --> 41:44.575
I need to talk
to you and Phil.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.162
Is everything okay?

41:50.092 --> 41:51.252
Yeah.

42:02.104 --> 42:04.436
I can't let you move.

42:04.898 --> 42:06.513
You drove all
the way out here just

42:06.650 --> 42:08.265
to tell us what
you already told us?

42:09.361 --> 42:11.602
I'm sorry.

42:21.123 --> 42:22.112
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

42:22.207 --> 42:25.119
WILSON: House, open up.
I don't want to
miss the opening bell.

42:28.755 --> 42:29.790
House?

42:40.976 --> 42:44.218
ANNOUNCER: ...telecast,
and we expect an electric
atmosphere in the arena

42:44.312 --> 42:48.305
and a sell-out
crowd of about 10,000
for Rubio vs. Santos.

42:48.442 --> 42:50.398
Two great fighters
with illustrious careers

42:50.485 --> 42:52.817
might have been
expected to meet
a long time ago.

42:52.946 --> 42:55.062
As for Santos,
his handlers tell us

42:55.157 --> 42:57.739
that he’s done more roadwork
than at any
time in his career,

42:57.826 --> 43:01.159
hoping to prove tonight
that he can box
for 12 full rounds.

43:01.288 --> 43:03.745
Significant,
because Santos
hasn ’t heard

43:03.874 --> 43:06.331
the final bell in
more than six years.

43:06.460 --> 43:08.576
He comes in with 11
straight knockout wins.

43:08.670 --> 43:11.503
He saw how a power-puncher
with a left hook

43:11.590 --> 43:13.831
was able to cut
Rubio over the right eye

43:14.009 --> 43:16.295
in the 10th round
of that last fight.
