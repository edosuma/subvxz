00:48.133 --> 00:49.341
Mister!

00:49.551 --> 00:50.801
Hey, mister!

00:51.427 --> 00:53.762
I want to report a crime.

00:54.347 --> 00:55.973
Down here.

00:56.182 --> 00:57.725
- Come on, you.
- Aah!

01:03.106 --> 01:04.274
What have we here?

01:04.480 --> 01:05.400
I saw --

01:05.608 --> 01:08.528
I was down by the river fishing,
and there were -- there were --

01:08.736 --> 01:10.447
Calm down, young one.
Take your time.

01:10.655 --> 01:14.784
I was down by the river fishing,
and I saw a giant silver knight.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.453
Did you, now?

01:17.912 --> 01:20.456
Um, Detective Murdoch?

01:20.664 --> 01:22.207
This young chap here --

01:22.417 --> 01:24.418
Alwyn.
Alwyn Jones.

01:24.626 --> 01:28.590
Alwyn claims to have seen
some sort of giant down by the river.

01:28.798 --> 01:29.674
Not a giant.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.760
A giant silver knight.

01:31.968 --> 01:33.427
And some men.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.513
And I heard "Bang! Bang! Bang!"

01:35.722 --> 01:37.473
- Gunshots?
- I think so.

01:37.682 --> 01:40.018
We need to search the area
for clues.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.604
Well, that is quite a story.

01:43.813 --> 01:46.316
It's not a story.
It really happened.

01:53.823 --> 01:56.116
Alwyn, is it?

01:57.743 --> 02:00.871
Why don't you and I
go and have a look?

02:02.540 --> 02:05.668
You get the most bites
just before sunrise.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.712
This here's the best spot.

02:07.921 --> 02:10.924
I even had a fish on my line
when I heard the bangs.

02:11.132 --> 02:12.967
Where did all of this happen?

02:13.550 --> 02:14.885
Over there.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.182
I was ascared to get any closer,

02:20.390 --> 02:22.060
but I could see
the giant knight.

02:34.697 --> 02:36.365
But that's not what I saw.

02:36.574 --> 02:38.283
I'm not making it up.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.707
No.
I know, Alwyn.

02:46.626 --> 02:48.461
There <i>were</i> shots.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.173
Probably hunters.

02:53.341 --> 02:56.134
You did the right thing
coming to me.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.930
Now let's get you home
for breakfast.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.989
Ow!
What the blazes?!

03:16.197 --> 03:17.240
Can't you see where --

03:18.658 --> 03:21.368
Yes. Well...

03:28.084 --> 03:29.294
Blind man.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.628
Blind...

03:31.837 --> 03:33.756
Are you okay, sir?

03:35.091 --> 03:37.885
It's been just the two of us
since my father died.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.513
Mother used to work
for the telegraph company,

03:40.722 --> 03:43.182
but she had to leave
to look after me.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.600
She was really good, too.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.270
She knew all the codes
and everything.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.492
Alwyn, you had me worried sick.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.621
But we were looking
for the giant knight

04:04.829 --> 04:06.205
I saw down by the river.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.873
I am so sorry.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.960
Alwyn has
a very vivid imagination.

04:11.169 --> 04:12.294
I didn't imagine it.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.379
Alwyn, you must learn
to tell the difference between --

04:14.588 --> 04:16.382
Detective.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.177
Sir, you're needed.
I'm afraid there's been a mur--

04:19.384 --> 04:22.680
Uh, thank you, Constable.
I'll be with you in a moment.

04:25.766 --> 04:30.605
Master Jones,
if ever you or your mother

04:30.812 --> 04:33.691
are in need of police help,

04:33.899 --> 04:36.653
come to the station
and ask for me.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.321
Thank you for your kindness...

04:38.528 --> 04:40.531
Detective Murdoch.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.230
What do we have, George?

05:13.439 --> 05:14.439
Ah, sir.

05:14.649 --> 05:17.067
This gentleman collapsed mid-street,
died on the spot.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.860
What makes you think
it wasn't natural causes?

05:19.069 --> 05:21.279
Well, sir,
have a look at the body.

05:21.822 --> 05:22.699
Oh.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.242
I see what you mean.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.120
Also, sir,
an old friend of ours is here.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.161
What friend is that?

05:28.370 --> 05:31.249
The one with the Martian airship
who chloroformed us.

05:32.625 --> 05:35.168
Terrence Meyers.

05:35.377 --> 05:40.882
If he's here, then something
very, very bad is afoot.

05:50.435 --> 05:51.644
Mr. Meyers.

05:51.853 --> 05:53.021
Detective Murdoch.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.439
Here to gas me again?

05:54.646 --> 05:57.274
Ah, can't let bygones
be bygones, huh?

05:57.483 --> 05:59.235
I'm odd that way.

05:59.444 --> 06:01.737
What brings you
to our crime scene?

06:01.946 --> 06:04.824
Oh, nothing more than
healthy curiosity, Detective.

06:05.033 --> 06:05.908
I happened to be in the area,

06:06.117 --> 06:08.745
and I was drawn
to all the commotion.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.788
- Mere happenstance, then?
- Mm.

06:10.997 --> 06:13.331
Well, I'm sure you'll
be attacking this investigation

06:13.540 --> 06:15.293
with your usual
dogged determination.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.461
And I look forward
to reading about the outcome

06:17.670 --> 06:19.213
in the newspaper.

06:19.422 --> 06:22.382
So, Detective.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.100
What can you tell me, Doctor?

06:32.310 --> 06:33.853
My first thought
is that he died of asphyxia,

06:34.062 --> 06:35.353
most likely caused by poison.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.396
Poison?

06:36.605 --> 06:38.858
The victim has an almond scent
emanating from him.

06:39.067 --> 06:40.817
Together with
the cherry-red skin color,

06:41.026 --> 06:41.985
it strongly suggests --

06:42.194 --> 06:43.028
Prussic acid.

06:43.237 --> 06:46.031
Even a trace amount
can cause near-instant death.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.949
Explaining the victim's
sudden collapse.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.584
Ezra Dolomore.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.711
May I remove the body now?

06:59.920 --> 07:00.797
Yes.
Of course.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.548
Gentlemen?

07:05.718 --> 07:06.718
What have you, George?

07:06.927 --> 07:09.555
Several witnesses claim
that as the victim expired,

07:09.764 --> 07:13.475
he was pointing and kept repeating,
"The blind man."

07:13.684 --> 07:14.601
"The blind man"?

07:14.810 --> 07:18.855
Yes, and one witness recalls
a blind man bumping into him.

07:19.524 --> 07:20.649
Blind, my ass.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.567
He could see just as well
as me or you.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.569
You or I, sir.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.115
No doubt the glasses and cane
were a disguise.

07:28.324 --> 07:30.992
And Terrence Meyers,
what was he doing there?

07:31.201 --> 07:33.079
He's not just out
for a casual stroll

07:33.286 --> 07:34.747
amongst the local riffraff,
is he?

07:34.956 --> 07:37.375
I highly doubt his presence there
was a coincidence.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.752
How did he get there so quickly?

07:40.586 --> 07:43.088
Perhaps he has a spy amongst us.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.798
In my station?

07:45.007 --> 07:46.591
Perish the thought, Murdoch.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.470
Most likely he was already interested
in the victim.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.889
Then what could this Dolomore fellow
have been up to

07:53.098 --> 07:54.766
that would interest
a government agent?

07:54.975 --> 07:56.269
I don't know.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.228
But I intend to find out.

08:06.028 --> 08:08.322
Professor Dolomore
built it himself.

08:08.531 --> 08:11.408
He was good with his hands.
Quite good with them.

08:11.617 --> 08:14.829
I mean, always tinkering away
on something.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.750
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss, Mrs. Eason.

08:19.959 --> 08:22.377
How long had you been
with the professor?

08:22.586 --> 08:25.088
Detective, I'm a married woman
and would never --

08:25.298 --> 08:26.882
Oh, I-I meant professionally.

08:27.091 --> 08:29.802
Oh.
Of course.

08:30.011 --> 08:31.803
Nine years now.

08:32.013 --> 08:34.389
I suppose I'm a little upset.

08:34.599 --> 08:37.183
I'll miss the little bugger.

08:38.144 --> 08:38.977
Yes.

08:39.187 --> 08:41.563
Do you know of anyone who
might have wanted to harm him?

08:41.772 --> 08:43.024
Not that I know of.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.734
But he was a fiery one.

08:44.942 --> 08:47.945
Go off about
the least little thing.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.155
Sir, what do you make of this?

08:51.365 --> 08:53.283
Algebraic formulae.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.869
The professor's latest project.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.538
I don't understand
how he made any sense of it,

08:57.746 --> 08:59.581
but when he was inspired...

09:00.791 --> 09:02.083
Here, George.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.586
Oh, sir, uh,

09:04.794 --> 09:07.298
I'm afraid I-I only made it
as far as the fourth standard.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.259
I want you to copy it down, George,
not solve it.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.802
Oh.
All right.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.889
Mrs. Eason, had there been
anything amiss recently

09:15.096 --> 09:16.474
with the professor?

09:16.682 --> 09:18.643
Well, he was
a little out of sorts.

09:18.850 --> 09:19.518
Oh?

09:19.726 --> 09:22.145
It's those terrible people
he worked for.

09:22.355 --> 09:24.440
They would upset him
something awful.

09:24.649 --> 09:26.484
He'd come home in such a dither.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.527
Did he happen to mention
what was upsetting him?

09:28.735 --> 09:29.986
No.

09:30.947 --> 09:32.322
And what department

09:32.530 --> 09:34.575
was the professor working with
at the university?

09:34.783 --> 09:36.952
Oh, he didn't teach anymore.

09:37.161 --> 09:39.705
These past few years,
he'd done all his work

09:39.913 --> 09:42.250
for a company called
Hammerton Industries.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.293
Hammerton Industries
produces hydraulic

09:45.503 --> 09:48.004
and pneumatic equipment
for use in manufacturing.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.048
Mr. Hammerton,

09:49.256 --> 09:51.801
what did Professor Dolomore
do for you specifically?

09:52.009 --> 09:54.052
Ezra was
a theoretical mathematician.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.679
We financed his research.

09:55.888 --> 09:56.889
Heady stuff.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.890
What was he researching?

09:59.100 --> 10:00.643
Anything and everything, really.

10:00.850 --> 10:04.272
Our specialty is making
the theoretical a reality.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.607
Do you know of anyone who
might have wanted to harm him?

10:08.692 --> 10:10.735
Well, his personality
was mercurial.

10:10.945 --> 10:12.613
He often had
strong disagreements

10:12.822 --> 10:15.115
with anyone holding
an opposing viewpoint.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.743
Apparently Professor Dolomore
was quite upset

10:17.951 --> 10:19.787
about something
regarding his work.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.663
Do you have any idea
what that might have been?

10:21.871 --> 10:23.749
Well, he and I had
frequent fallings-out.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.419
But I learned some time ago
not to take these things personally.

10:28.296 --> 10:30.798
And what were
these arguments about?

10:31.548 --> 10:34.552
I live in a practical world, Detective.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.971
Business decisions cannot be based
on flights of fancy.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.474
Ezra couldn't accept that.

10:40.682 --> 10:41.642
I see.

10:41.850 --> 10:42.893
Thank you.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.354
Oh, one more thing,
Mr. Hammerton.

10:45.562 --> 10:48.774
Does the name Terrence Meyers
mean anything to you?

10:48.982 --> 10:51.402
No.
Should it?

10:52.235 --> 10:53.195
No.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.155
Thank you.
I'll see myself out.

11:02.038 --> 11:04.706
And you think that a clue
lies in this formula?

11:04.914 --> 11:07.543
Formulae, sir.
There are more than one.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.046
Hammerton Industries
thought enough

11:10.254 --> 11:13.256
of Professor Dolomore's work
that they funded his research.

11:13.466 --> 11:15.551
And these projects are
valuable enough to kill over?

11:15.759 --> 11:17.135
Depending on what they are, yes.

11:17.345 --> 11:18.346
And what are they?

11:19.263 --> 11:21.389
Well, that's very complex.

11:21.599 --> 11:23.517
And I'm not sure yet.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.437
Sir, a very mysterious package
has arrived for you.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.815
And you'll notice
it smells delicious.

11:30.024 --> 11:31.024
Thank you, George.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.403
At this station, Murdoch,
we share the spoils.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.614
Right.
What have we got here?

11:36.822 --> 11:38.573
Ah, home-baked, no less.

11:38.783 --> 11:40.533
- And a note.
- Thank you.

11:42.661 --> 11:45.413
"Thank you for bringing me home,
Detective Murdoch.

11:45.623 --> 11:48.084
I hope you like rhubarb.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.211
Yours sincerely, Alwyn Jones."

11:50.418 --> 11:52.421
Alwyn -- That's the boy
who came in about the giant.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.548
Boy? Giant?
Rhubarb?

11:54.756 --> 11:56.634
Does this lad have
an older sister?

11:56.841 --> 11:59.010
A mother, actually.
She's a widow.

11:59.220 --> 12:00.221
Detective?

12:00.428 --> 12:03.014
Uh, Dr. Ogden has asked for you
in the morgue.

12:03.224 --> 12:04.642
Thank you, Constable.

12:04.850 --> 12:07.102
We'll take good care of this, Murdoch.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.235
Seems like Dr. Ogden's
getting a run for her money.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.947
Actually, sir, I think
the doctor and Detective Murdoch

12:18.154 --> 12:19.240
are on the outs.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.282
Really?

12:20.490 --> 12:22.326
Why was I not made aware
of this?

12:32.001 --> 12:32.836
Doctor.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.172
Detective.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.049
I'm able to confirm
that Ezra Dolomore

12:38.259 --> 12:39.634
died of prussic-acid poisoning.

12:39.844 --> 12:42.138
Ah, very good.
Thank you.

12:42.346 --> 12:43.721
But you didn't call me here

12:43.931 --> 12:45.850
to confirm something
we already suspected.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.143
Yes.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.811
Yes, you're right.
I didn't.

12:49.019 --> 12:52.480
After further examination,
I discovered this.

12:52.690 --> 12:56.527
It was lodged
in our victim's lower calf.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.613
A pellet?

12:59.822 --> 13:00.947
Not just any pellet.

13:01.157 --> 13:05.660
It's hollow and has a tiny hole
drilled in its surface.

13:06.245 --> 13:08.205
Something seems
to be coating it.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.666
Yes, I noticed that as well.
Wax, I believe.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.793
But for what purpose?

13:13.001 --> 13:16.129
Suppose the pellet
was filled with a poison.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.048
Wax could have acted as a seal.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.426
And if the pellet was then injected
into someone...

13:20.634 --> 13:23.052
Within seconds, their body temperature
would melt the wax.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.597
Allowing the poison
to exude into the bloodstream.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.349
Ingenious.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.726
A sophisticated
time-delay mechanism.

13:29.934 --> 13:30.811
Yes.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.522
Allowing the murderer
to simply walk away from the scene

13:33.730 --> 13:34.648
with no one the wiser.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.067
But how was that possible
in such a public place?

13:42.865 --> 13:44.866
Ow!
What the blazes?!

13:45.075 --> 13:46.576
Can't you see where --

13:50.288 --> 13:53.000
A blind man
bumped into Mr. Dolomore

13:53.209 --> 13:54.501
shortly before he died.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.003
He could have injected him then.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.171
How?

13:58.004 --> 13:59.173
With his cane.

13:59.380 --> 14:03.677
No doubt a sophisticated
pressurized weapon of some sort,

14:03.885 --> 14:04.802
like an air rifle.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.639
How fantastic,
like something from a novel.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.390
Who would go to such trouble?

14:10.183 --> 14:11.393
A professional killer?

14:11.601 --> 14:13.144
Why on earth would anyone

14:13.354 --> 14:15.313
want to assassinate
a mathematics professor?

14:15.523 --> 14:18.399
I believe I may have
some answers for you.

14:19.235 --> 14:21.236
Mr. Meyers.

14:21.445 --> 14:23.364
Detective.

14:24.657 --> 14:26.575
What I'm about to reveal
to you both

14:26.783 --> 14:29.161
must be kept
in the strictest confidence.

14:29.370 --> 14:31.746
No doubt a matter
of national security.

14:31.956 --> 14:32.706
Precisely.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.417
The person responsible
for Ezra Dolomore's death

14:35.625 --> 14:36.793
is a Prussian agent.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.671
His name is Caspar Bomgaarts.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.338
And I'd very much like you, Detective,

14:40.548 --> 14:41.966
to locate and apprehend him.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.385
Mr. Meyers,
I would very much appreciate it

14:45.594 --> 14:48.013
if you would refrain
from smoking in my morgue.

14:51.850 --> 14:52.768
Certainly.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.062
Who is this Bomgaarts,

14:56.272 --> 14:58.649
and what has he to do
with Professor Dolomore's death?

14:59.232 --> 15:00.859
Let's just say that information
is a matter of --

15:01.067 --> 15:02.903
- National security.
- National security.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.365
Precisely.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.950
Well, if this is so important,

15:08.158 --> 15:10.244
why haven't <i>you</i>
apprehended him already?

15:11.035 --> 15:13.538
My entanglements are such
that I can't be perceived

15:13.746 --> 15:17.000
to be persecuting
a Prussian national.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.168
On the other hand,
if a local authority

15:19.378 --> 15:22.213
were to be investigating
a murder, well...

15:24.841 --> 15:26.467
Here.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.761
The Prussian.

15:31.264 --> 15:35.436
Mr. Meyers,
after our first adventure,

15:35.644 --> 15:38.897
what makes you think that I would
possibly do your bidding?

15:39.105 --> 15:42.860
Because, Detective,
you have a murder to solve.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.706
Caspar Bomgaarts.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.582
What kind of asinine name
is that?

15:57.790 --> 15:58.792
Prussian.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.043
I know it's Prussian.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.211
Just why is it so asinine?

16:02.421 --> 16:04.715
But I suppose that explains
the prussic acid.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.634
Actually, sir,
that's a coincidence.

16:06.841 --> 16:09.345
Prussian, prussic.
Really?

16:09.552 --> 16:11.721
Yes, its name is derived
from the fact

16:11.929 --> 16:15.517
that it's used to create
a pigment called Prussian blue.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.686
It's used in dyes and paints.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.022
George, I'll need you
to find this man.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.066
- Start at the consulate.
- I don't think so.

16:22.274 --> 16:25.943
If he is an agent, we don't want to be
ruffling any feathers.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.946
Ah.
Good point.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.865
You'll have to be resourceful, George.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.658
And no heroics, bugalugs.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.619
This Bomgaarts
is clearly dangerous.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.203
Don't try apprehending him alone.

16:35.788 --> 16:37.163
Sirs.

16:37.748 --> 16:39.540
So, what was Dolomore working on

16:39.750 --> 16:42.126
that would make the Prussians
want to assassinate him?

16:42.794 --> 16:45.463
As far as I can tell,
they're a series of algorithms.

16:45.673 --> 16:46.506
Algorithms?

16:46.715 --> 16:49.717
Yes, it's Latin
for "calculating method,"

16:49.927 --> 16:52.763
although their origins lie
with Persian mathematicians.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.556
I meant what are they?

16:54.764 --> 16:55.432
Ah.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.143
Well, they're a series
of calculations

16:58.351 --> 17:02.438
that lead to more calculations
that end in a concrete result.

17:02.648 --> 17:04.066
What?

17:06.192 --> 17:07.611
Say you have two numbers.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.278
It's a mathematical way
of reducing them

17:09.488 --> 17:12.656
down to zero or one --
concrete result.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.535
So what bloody use is that?

17:15.742 --> 17:20.582
Sir, it's a concrete result --
one or zero, on or off.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.836
So it could be used
like in machines, say,

17:24.044 --> 17:26.462
to turn a switch on or off?

17:26.672 --> 17:29.090
That is a possible application.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.050
Hammerton Industries
builds machines.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.301
Yes, they do.

17:32.510 --> 17:33.971
What kind of machine, then?

17:35.138 --> 17:36.347
I have no idea,

17:36.557 --> 17:41.686
but clearly Professor Dolomore
had more notes somewhere.

17:55.576 --> 17:57.368
Hello?

17:58.871 --> 18:00.372
Mrs. Eason?

18:37.075 --> 18:38.786
Detective Murdoch.

18:38.993 --> 18:41.038
What have you done
to the professor's house?

18:41.246 --> 18:44.290
Someone, not me,
has ransacked it.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.460
What on earth for?

18:46.667 --> 18:49.086
I believe the professor
had in his possession

18:49.296 --> 18:50.631
some very valuable documents.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.758
And someone was eager
to get their hands on them.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.177
But what are you doing
to the professor's clock?

18:56.385 --> 18:58.763
Well, I suspect the professor
hid those documents

18:58.971 --> 19:01.016
to keep them from falling
into the wrong hands.

19:01.224 --> 19:02.726
And you think he hid them
in the clock?

19:04.185 --> 19:06.521
For some reason,
the clock wasn't keeping time,

19:06.730 --> 19:10.025
and you told me yourself
that he built it.

19:12.653 --> 19:14.779
When I said the professor
was good with his hands,

19:14.988 --> 19:17.532
I wasn't talking
about the clock.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.492
Oh.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.662
But if what you're looking for

19:21.869 --> 19:23.747
are the professor's journals,

19:23.955 --> 19:26.165
he gave them to me
a few days ago.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.960
Why didn't you
tell me this earlier?

19:28.167 --> 19:31.505
He said to tell no one,
no matter who they claimed to be.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.589
Of course.
Of course.

19:33.798 --> 19:37.594
Mrs. Eason, I suspect
that whatever is in those documents

19:37.802 --> 19:40.638
may have cost the professor
his life.

19:41.722 --> 19:42.891
Very well.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.685
I suppose you'll be wanting
the letter, too.

19:45.894 --> 19:46.728
What letter?

19:46.936 --> 19:48.980
The one he had written
to the prime minister.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.898
"I accuse my employers

19:51.107 --> 19:51.942
of stealing public dollars

19:52.150 --> 19:54.027
allocated for pure
scientific research

19:54.236 --> 19:55.695
in order to bastardize my work

19:55.903 --> 19:58.365
for their own
crass monetary gain."

19:58.574 --> 20:00.157
Just what kind of work was that?

20:00.366 --> 20:02.869
According to his journals,
Professor Dolomore

20:03.077 --> 20:05.955
was working on his own version
of Babbage's Analytical Engine.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.249
Analytical Engine?

20:07.457 --> 20:08.959
Yes, a machine
capable of solving

20:09.166 --> 20:12.296
complex mathematical problems
at a speed far beyond human.

20:12.503 --> 20:14.047
A computing machine.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.549
So why haven't I heard
of this Analytical Engine?

20:16.758 --> 20:18.634
- Because there isn't one.
- Oh.

20:18.844 --> 20:20.178
It would have had to be massive,

20:20.386 --> 20:22.890
making it too impractical
and expensive to complete.

20:23.097 --> 20:25.601
So Dolomore must have believed
he'd solved those problems.

20:26.643 --> 20:29.061
But what's the value
in a computing machine?

20:29.270 --> 20:31.981
I've got a slide rule and an abacus,
and they work just fine.

20:32.190 --> 20:35.109
Well, for one thing,
it could compute these algorithms.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.740
To run a machine of some sort.

20:42.491 --> 20:43.868
Oh, Mr. Hammerton?

20:44.076 --> 20:46.163
Detective!
You've, uh, made an arrest?

20:46.371 --> 20:47.873
Unfortunately, no.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.291
I do, however,
have more questions for you.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.252
Of course. Well, I'm just
on my way to a business meeting.

20:53.461 --> 20:54.630
May we ride and talk?

20:54.837 --> 20:56.173
Certainly.

20:58.508 --> 21:01.053
Ah, yes.
Analytical engine, was it?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.471
I'm not surprised.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.306
- You knew of it?
- Of course.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.849
And let me tell you, Detective,
if that device worked,

21:07.058 --> 21:08.935
it would change the world
as we know it.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.188
How so?

21:11.813 --> 21:13.230
There's a revolution coming.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.651
And the battlefield
is the factory.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.527
I'm not following you, sir.

21:17.736 --> 21:19.779
We build industrial machines.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.615
Currently they're run by men.

21:21.823 --> 21:23.909
Expensive.
Unreliable.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.993
But what if those men
weren't needed?

21:26.202 --> 21:29.623
What if those machines
could run themselves?

21:29.830 --> 21:33.335
For that, the machines
would have to be able to think.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.253
That's where Professor Dolomore's work
fit in.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.422
Precisely.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.675
Machines that can run themselves.

21:40.884 --> 21:42.426
And whatever company
embraced them

21:42.635 --> 21:46.013
would make unheard-of profits.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.933
What of the workers
who would all lose their jobs?

21:49.142 --> 21:51.353
They'd be living
the life of luxury.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.396
Machines doing their work
for them.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.106
It seems to me this is something

21:55.315 --> 21:57.108
that would be worth
killing over.

21:57.317 --> 22:00.487
A device that could change
the economic face of the planet.

22:00.695 --> 22:02.364
We'll never know.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.825
If only Ezra had finished
his work.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.871
If only.

22:14.125 --> 22:17.378
Uh, sir, might I have a word with you
about Caspar Bomgaarts?

22:17.586 --> 22:18.587
Ah, yes.
Have you found him?

22:18.797 --> 22:20.673
He's proving to be
quite the slippery customer.

22:20.882 --> 22:23.009
I began by making a list
of places I might go

22:23.218 --> 22:24.385
if I were Prussian.

22:24.594 --> 22:28.222
The list was long, and most of the
places I would go to anyway.

22:28.432 --> 22:30.599
That is, until I discovered
the existence

22:30.808 --> 22:33.310
of a Prussian social club
right here in Toronto.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.186
Oh? And?

22:34.395 --> 22:36.105
Well, Bomgaarts
is a regular patron there.

22:36.314 --> 22:37.231
He's very partial

22:37.441 --> 22:40.027
to the Bavarian sausage
and sauerkraut they served,

22:40.234 --> 22:42.695
both of which, by the way,
are delicious.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.198
He was also a great drinker
of pilsner

22:45.406 --> 22:46.490
and an exceptional player
of darts.

22:46.700 --> 22:47.701
Yes, yes, yes, George.

22:47.909 --> 22:48.993
Long and short of it, sir,

22:49.201 --> 22:51.246
is he hasn't been to the club
in several days.

22:51.454 --> 22:52.788
Nobody knows where he lives.

22:52.998 --> 22:54.624
Nobody seems to know much
about him at all.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.084
Right.
Well, keep looking.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.002
We need to find him.
And be careful.

22:58.211 --> 22:58.878
Sir.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.882
Oh, and, sir, you have a guest.

23:09.556 --> 23:10.515
Mrs. Jones.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.976
Detective Murdoch,
I'm sorry to disturb you.

23:13.184 --> 23:15.228
But I-I didn't know
who else to turn to.

23:15.436 --> 23:18.647
- What's happened?
- Alwyn has gone missing.

23:18.856 --> 23:19.816
Are you sure?

23:20.025 --> 23:22.152
He's always home for dinner.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.528
It's now three hours past.

23:25.113 --> 23:26.698
That's peculiar.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.366
- Was he upset about something?
- No, no.

23:29.576 --> 23:34.455
Well, he's been nattering
on and on about the giant.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.124
Might that be it?

23:37.917 --> 23:41.128
I'll start by having a look
down by the river.

23:41.712 --> 23:43.048
Alwyn!

23:43.256 --> 23:46.050
- Alwyn!
- Master Jones!

23:47.219 --> 23:48.845
Alwyn!

23:49.554 --> 23:50.680
Alwyn!

23:50.888 --> 23:52.182
I can't see anything!

23:52.390 --> 23:54.142
- Master Jones!
- Alwyn!

23:54.351 --> 23:55.644
He has to be out here, gentlemen.

23:55.852 --> 23:56.560
Master Jones!

23:56.769 --> 23:58.605
Alwyn, where are you?

23:59.314 --> 24:01.148
Please!
You won't be punished!

24:01.357 --> 24:02.400
Master Jones!

24:02.608 --> 24:06.320
I just want you safe
and home with me!

24:06.529 --> 24:07.571
Master Jones!

24:09.406 --> 24:10.282
Sir!

24:10.491 --> 24:12.326
I think we've got something!

24:13.327 --> 24:14.371
What is it?

24:14.578 --> 24:16.623
Drowning victim,
I'm afraid, sir.

24:16.832 --> 24:17.833
Found something!

24:18.040 --> 24:20.251
Down by the water, cops!

24:20.460 --> 24:24.256
Mrs. Jones,
you'd best stay here.

24:31.555 --> 24:33.807
Sir, she probably
shouldn't see this.

24:34.015 --> 24:34.849
Thank you, George.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.477
- Mrs. Jones, please stay back.
- No. I need to see.

24:37.685 --> 24:38.686
- You should stay back.
- Constable!

24:38.894 --> 24:40.355
Bring that lantern over!

24:40.564 --> 24:42.022
Coming, sir!
Coming!

24:42.857 --> 24:44.526
Sir, it's not the boy.

24:44.733 --> 24:47.069
In fact, it's not a boy at all.

24:47.278 --> 24:49.114
It's a dwarf.

24:54.911 --> 24:58.289
I never even thought,
"Who is that poor man?"

24:58.498 --> 25:01.417
I just thanked God
it wasn't Alwyn.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.961
That's only natural.

25:07.048 --> 25:09.593
He's, uh...

25:09.800 --> 25:12.636
He's everything in the world
that matters to me.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.722
Of course.

25:16.391 --> 25:19.603
Well, nothing more
can be done here tonight.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.605
My men will keep searching.

25:21.813 --> 25:25.817
And the moment we find anything,
you will be the first to know.

25:26.734 --> 25:30.321
Constable, could you please
see Mrs. Jones safely home?

25:30.946 --> 25:34.867
We'll not rest
until Alwyn is found.

25:35.076 --> 25:37.077
I know.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.587
Doctor.

25:46.796 --> 25:48.088
Prussic acid again?

25:48.298 --> 25:49.465
Almost certainly.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.675
There's also some strange bruising
and abrasions

25:51.884 --> 25:54.596
on the medial side
of the navicular bone.

25:54.804 --> 25:55.680
Interesting.

25:57.265 --> 25:59.476
Based on corneal opacity, rigor,
and state of decay,

25:59.683 --> 26:02.686
I'd estimate time of death
was roughly 48 hours ago.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.647
About the same time Alwyn claims

26:04.855 --> 26:07.525
to have witnessed strange events
in the area.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.527
He also mentioned gunfire,

26:09.736 --> 26:12.321
but the victim seems
to have been poisoned, not shot.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.531
Alwyn -- Is that his name?

26:14.740 --> 26:16.076
Yes.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.788
If only I'd taken him
more seriously, perhaps...

26:19.996 --> 26:22.123
William, you can't
blame yourself for this.

26:22.332 --> 26:24.000
It's not your fault.

26:24.209 --> 26:26.086
You'll find him.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.923
You're right.
I will.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.394
You been working here all night?

26:44.061 --> 26:46.397
I caught a few winks at my desk.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.817
Do we know
who the second victim is?

26:49.025 --> 26:51.443
There was nothing on his body
to identify him.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.529
Constable Crabtree
is making inquiries.

26:53.738 --> 26:55.615
And still no word on the lad?

26:55.824 --> 26:57.032
None.

26:57.992 --> 27:00.036
I feel I should be doing more.

27:00.244 --> 27:03.038
Listen, every available man
is out there looking.

27:03.248 --> 27:05.875
I have to keep my mind working.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.628
I'm certain the answer
to Professor Dolomore's death

27:09.837 --> 27:11.298
is somewhere in these formulae.

27:11.506 --> 27:13.633
I just can't seem to --

27:16.510 --> 27:17.721
I have to do something.

27:17.929 --> 27:20.807
Murdoch, be sensible.

27:21.016 --> 27:22.892
There's nothing more to be done.

27:24.519 --> 27:27.814
Alwyn saw something
down by the river.

27:28.022 --> 27:31.233
I intend to find out what.

27:54.465 --> 27:55.592
I would very much appreciate it

27:55.799 --> 27:57.634
if you would refrain
from smoking in my morgue.

28:00.971 --> 28:03.182
- Meyers.
- Nein.

28:03.391 --> 28:06.435
My name is Caspar Bomgaarts.

28:06.644 --> 28:08.855
Your rather clumsy
Constable Crabtree

28:09.064 --> 28:11.316
has been bumbling about
looking for me.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.983
So here I am.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.527
- Wha--
- Ah, ah, ah!

28:14.736 --> 28:16.237
I have the gun.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.323
I ask the questions.

28:18.906 --> 28:20.657
Now...

28:21.826 --> 28:23.661
Who killed Professor Dolomore?

28:23.869 --> 28:26.413
According to Terrence Meyers, you did.

28:26.623 --> 28:28.375
Of course he would say that.

28:28.583 --> 28:30.376
But let me tell you this.

28:30.585 --> 28:32.753
I did not kill Dolomore.

28:33.922 --> 28:35.339
Why should I believe you?

28:35.548 --> 28:40.177
Because he was of far more value to me
alive than dead.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.680
If you didn't kill him,
then who did?

28:42.888 --> 28:45.182
I suggest you ask Meyers.

28:46.058 --> 28:50.270
Now it is clear you can be
of no further help to me, Detective.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.565
So...

28:53.232 --> 28:55.317
Goodbye.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.625
Inspector?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.337
George?

29:18.465 --> 29:20.468
Who's there?

29:33.397 --> 29:34.648
Who's there?

29:34.857 --> 29:36.317
Who are you?

29:36.526 --> 29:37.652
And what do you want?

29:37.861 --> 29:40.864
I'll be asking
the questions here, Murdoch.

29:46.493 --> 29:47.619
Julia?

29:48.663 --> 29:50.123
What's the nature
of your relationship

29:50.330 --> 29:51.915
with this Mrs. Jones?

29:52.791 --> 29:54.836
Her son's gone missing.
I'm helping to find him.

29:55.044 --> 29:56.296
Nothing more?

29:56.880 --> 29:57.922
No.

29:58.882 --> 30:00.133
I don't believe you.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.301
She fascinates you, doesn't she?

30:03.678 --> 30:04.429
I --

30:04.636 --> 30:06.722
Answer the question, Murdoch!

30:06.931 --> 30:08.892
Murdoch.

30:10.602 --> 30:11.644
Murdoch.

30:11.853 --> 30:12.729
Murdoch!

30:14.521 --> 30:15.940
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.733
You were gone such a long time.

30:17.942 --> 30:19.318
What happened?

30:19.527 --> 30:21.863
Oh.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.615
I was chloroformed again.

30:23.823 --> 30:26.116
Meyers.
Bloody scoundrel.

30:26.326 --> 30:27.576
No, not Meyers.

30:27.785 --> 30:29.953
Not Meyers?
Then who?

30:30.163 --> 30:32.789
Caspar Bomgaarts.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.167
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.461
One thing is certain.

30:37.670 --> 30:39.881
Meyers was down here
by the river.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.383
And I want to know why.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.142
Not bad.

30:51.351 --> 30:53.353
Not bad for a domestic.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.105
- Oh.
- I still prefer my Havanas.

30:58.148 --> 31:00.026
Would you, um, like to try one?

31:00.234 --> 31:02.778
Oh, that's very kind of you,
Mr. Meyers.

31:02.987 --> 31:05.155
Now, what did you want
to see me about, Inspector?

31:05.365 --> 31:07.200
- Hmm.
- Mr. Meyers.

31:07.407 --> 31:09.701
Ah.
Detective.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.578
Have you located Bomgaarts yet?

31:11.788 --> 31:14.582
I have.
Or, I should say, he located me.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.500
Then why haven't you
arrested him?

31:16.709 --> 31:19.503
Because I'm not entirely convinced
he's guilty.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.172
Well, that's nonsense.
The man is a killer.

31:21.381 --> 31:24.008
Funny.
He says the same thing about you.

31:24.217 --> 31:26.385
That is ludicrous.

31:26.594 --> 31:29.346
Mr. Meyers,
why was your brand of cigar

31:29.556 --> 31:31.723
found lying in the grass
near the scene of a murder?

31:32.517 --> 31:35.144
You're way off course there, Detective.

31:35.353 --> 31:38.105
The same place where a young boy,
who is now missing,

31:38.314 --> 31:40.441
said there were
strange goings-on.

31:40.650 --> 31:43.318
A boy's life may be on the line,
Mr. Meyers.

31:43.528 --> 31:45.529
I think it's about time
you came clean

31:45.738 --> 31:47.240
or face the consequences.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.534
Must I remind you, gentlemen,

31:49.741 --> 31:51.827
that I am far beyond
the reach of the law?

31:52.036 --> 31:53.121
But not the press.

31:53.328 --> 31:57.040
And I'm sure they would be
very interested in what I know.

32:00.795 --> 32:03.756
I believe that is called treason.

32:03.964 --> 32:06.134
And I think you know the price for that.

32:06.342 --> 32:09.345
If that's what it takes
to make you talk.

32:17.478 --> 32:19.021
All right.

32:20.230 --> 32:23.483
But I will need a piece
of special equipment.

32:25.694 --> 32:28.155
This is a film projector,

32:28.364 --> 32:31.075
manufactured for us
by Thomas Edison himself.

32:31.284 --> 32:32.826
A projector, you say.

32:33.036 --> 32:34.996
This goes far beyond
the Kinetoscope.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.038
It's simply --

32:36.247 --> 32:37.373
Fascinating.

32:37.582 --> 32:38.499
Yes.

32:38.708 --> 32:39.709
Mr. Meyers?

32:39.916 --> 32:42.920
The film you are about to see was
smuggled out of Prussia

32:43.128 --> 32:45.464
at a cost of a great many lives.

32:45.673 --> 32:47.842
As you may be aware, gentlemen,

32:48.050 --> 32:51.386
Prussia has become a nation
of increasing political influence

32:51.596 --> 32:53.347
as well as military strength,

32:53.556 --> 32:56.267
and can therefore only be perceived
by us as a threat.

32:56.476 --> 32:58.560
But we're not at war
with Prussia.

32:59.394 --> 33:01.564
Fortunately, not yet.

33:02.565 --> 33:03.900
Lights out, please.

33:21.334 --> 33:23.711
What the bloody hell is that?

33:24.628 --> 33:29.509
That, gentlemen,
is the Prussians' Doomsday Automaton.

33:30.093 --> 33:32.220
If such a weapon
were to be unleashed upon us,

33:32.427 --> 33:33.346
it would be unstoppable.

33:33.554 --> 33:34.971
When we discovered
the Prussians had it,

33:35.181 --> 33:37.349
we had no choice but to beat them
at their own game.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.269
Are you saying
you built an automaton?

33:40.478 --> 33:43.064
You didn't build it.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.316
Hammerton Industries did,
didn't they?

33:45.525 --> 33:46.401
Correct.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.694
But the building of it
wasn't the problem, was it?

33:49.444 --> 33:50.488
No.

33:50.697 --> 33:52.781
No, the automaton
had to be able to react

33:52.990 --> 33:54.659
to battlefield conditions.

33:54.866 --> 33:55.785
It had to think.

33:55.992 --> 33:57.369
That's where
Professor Dolomore's

33:57.577 --> 33:58.996
analytical engine came in.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.123
Exactly.

34:00.330 --> 34:03.459
Which is why the Prussians sent
Bomgaarts to assassinate him,

34:03.667 --> 34:05.920
in an effort
to sabotage our plans.

34:06.128 --> 34:08.630
And now, without Dolomore,
your project is scuttled.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.297
Quite the contrary.

34:10.507 --> 34:12.342
Our automaton has capabilities

34:12.552 --> 34:13.844
far beyond that
of the Prussians'.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.139
It is the ultimate war machine,

34:16.347 --> 34:19.891
therefore the ultimate instrument
of peace.

34:20.101 --> 34:24.480
Detective, you have been charged
by your government

34:24.688 --> 34:26.440
to locate an assassin.

34:26.648 --> 34:29.025
I suggest you carry through
on your assignment.

34:29.235 --> 34:30.570
Please do not touch the machine.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.947
My men will be by momentarily
to collect it.

34:37.617 --> 34:40.621
Supercilious sod.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.833
What do you make
of this Doomsday Automaton business?

34:45.251 --> 34:46.960
I suspect that what young,

34:47.170 --> 34:49.713
now-missing Alwyn Jones
saw down by the river

34:49.922 --> 34:52.842
was a demonstration
of Mr. Meyers' automaton.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.802
So the bloody thing works.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.137
Apparently.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.222
Yet according to
Professor Dolomore's notes,

34:59.431 --> 35:02.018
his analytical engine
wouldn't have fit in this room,

35:02.226 --> 35:04.103
let alone inside
the automaton's head.

35:04.311 --> 35:05.813
Then it couldn't work.

35:06.021 --> 35:07.898
I smell a rat, Murdoch.

35:08.106 --> 35:08.900
Indeed.

35:09.108 --> 35:11.152
So whatever is going on,

35:11.360 --> 35:14.447
it seems that young Master Jones
is caught up in it.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.867
His mother must be worried sick.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.161
I should go and visit her.

35:22.246 --> 35:24.831
Uh, sir, I found the identity
of the dwarf.

35:25.041 --> 35:25.916
Ah.
Very good, George.

35:26.125 --> 35:27.751
He was a circus performer.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.545
Went by the show name
of Big Littleman.

35:30.755 --> 35:31.755
Hmm.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.090
The stilts' leather straps
could explain

35:34.300 --> 35:35.927
the strange pattern of bruising
on his feet.

35:36.135 --> 35:37.594
Except this flyer is very old.

35:37.804 --> 35:40.139
Apparently Mr. Littleman
left the show years ago.

35:40.347 --> 35:41.516
What's he been doing since?

35:41.724 --> 35:44.768
Well, no one in the circus world
has seen hide nor hair of him.

35:45.478 --> 35:47.938
Well, if he wasn't performing
on the stilts any longer,

35:48.146 --> 35:49.815
why did he still have
the bruising on his feet?

35:50.023 --> 35:52.025
Good question, sir.

35:53.402 --> 35:55.195
George, I have a stop to make.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.030
In the meantime,
I need you to pay a visit

35:57.239 --> 35:58.574
to the Prussian social club.

35:58.782 --> 35:59.992
Sir.

36:21.347 --> 36:22.514
Have you --

36:22.722 --> 36:23.766
Not yet.

36:23.974 --> 36:27.811
My men are searching the city,
and he will be found.

36:28.019 --> 36:31.481
Dear God, where can he be?

36:31.690 --> 36:33.525
I have no idea.

36:33.733 --> 36:37.530
However, I did learn that Alwyn
was telling the truth.

36:38.114 --> 36:40.449
But giants and guns...

36:40.657 --> 36:42.994
Sounds far-fetched, I know.

36:43.202 --> 36:44.411
But it is real.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.998
Unfortunately,
I can't tell you any more.

36:48.833 --> 36:50.668
I should have believed him.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.085
Mrs. Jones --

36:52.295 --> 36:57.507
Enid... believe me when
I tell you he will be found.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.851
I trust there's been
some development, Inspector?

37:07.059 --> 37:09.311
You could say that.

37:12.106 --> 37:13.733
Bomgaarts.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.233
Hello, Meyers.

37:15.443 --> 37:17.612
Gentlemen,
your nation is proud of you.

37:17.820 --> 37:19.447
I will handle matters
from here on.

37:19.655 --> 37:22.407
Actually, Mr. Meyers,
it's not quite that simple.

37:23.617 --> 37:24.619
What are you talking about?

37:24.827 --> 37:26.329
You captured
a treacherous assassin here.

37:26.536 --> 37:28.831
Liar.
<i>You</i> killed the scientist.

37:29.039 --> 37:32.251
I did no such thing.
You are the liar.

37:32.460 --> 37:33.668
Murdering liar.

37:33.878 --> 37:35.420
No, you're the murdering liar.

37:35.630 --> 37:37.340
No, you are the murdering liar!

37:37.547 --> 37:39.090
Gentlemen!
Enough!

37:40.092 --> 37:42.762
Mr. Meyers, have a seat.

37:45.222 --> 37:46.681
While it's clear both of you

37:46.891 --> 37:48.809
seem to have trouble
with the truth,

37:49.018 --> 37:51.938
neither of you is a killer,
at least in this instance.

37:52.146 --> 37:53.773
What are you talking about?

37:53.981 --> 37:56.567
The two of you have been
played off against each other.

37:56.775 --> 37:59.695
What does this mean,
"played off"?

37:59.903 --> 38:03.157
I believe the detective
is suggesting we've been used.

38:03.365 --> 38:05.742
The Prussians don't have
a doomsday machine.

38:05.952 --> 38:07.411
Of course we don't.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.246
But you wanted to build one,
which is why

38:09.454 --> 38:11.331
you were so interested
in Professor Dolomore.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.458
- Naturally.
- This is ridiculous.

38:13.668 --> 38:16.253
The Prussians have an automaton.
You saw the film yourselves.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.463
We have no such thing, Terrence.

38:19.422 --> 38:21.884
And neither do you, Mr. Meyers.

38:22.550 --> 38:23.135
It's impossible.

38:23.344 --> 38:25.762
We have it on impeccable authority
that he has one.

38:26.681 --> 38:27.639
Do you?

38:27.847 --> 38:30.141
Is that what Alwyn Jones saw
that morning?

38:30.351 --> 38:32.936
A demonstration of your machine?

38:33.728 --> 38:36.023
And it was spectacular.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.525
Unfortunately for you,
it doesn't work.

38:37.733 --> 38:39.735
What are you talking about?
I witnessed it myself.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.362
What you saw was a mock-up,

38:41.570 --> 38:44.114
a hollow shell
being piloted by a dwarf.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.574
A what? A dwarf?
What dwarf?

38:46.784 --> 38:48.994
The one we fished
out of the river.

38:49.704 --> 38:51.079
I had nothing to do with that.

38:51.288 --> 38:52.998
We know you didn't.
You were duped.

38:53.206 --> 38:54.958
I was no such thing!

38:55.166 --> 38:57.545
Your automaton
is a scientific impossibility.

38:57.753 --> 38:59.045
The film you saw was created

38:59.255 --> 39:01.840
to make you believe the Prussians had
such a machine.

39:02.048 --> 39:03.592
Who would do such a thing?

39:04.385 --> 39:07.012
Hammerton Industries.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.347
Hammerton? Why?

39:09.556 --> 39:12.059
So you would authorize
a virtually unlimited flow

39:12.268 --> 39:13.893
of government money
into their coffers.

39:14.103 --> 39:16.355
Are you suggesting that someone
would try to profiteer

39:16.563 --> 39:17.648
from the threat of war?

39:17.856 --> 39:20.568
It seems ridiculous, but yes.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.403
And it wasn't by chance
that Mr. Bomgaarts' government

39:23.612 --> 39:24.780
was made aware
of your automaton.

39:24.989 --> 39:25.905
It wasn't?

39:26.114 --> 39:29.534
If you investigate the company
building your automaton,

39:29.744 --> 39:31.661
I suspect you'll discover
that it's owned

39:31.871 --> 39:35.041
by none other
than Hammerton Industries.

39:40.211 --> 39:45.092
Gentlemen, I need to confer
with my consulate.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.219
As do I.

39:48.012 --> 39:50.139
Auf Wiedersehen, Caspar.

39:51.222 --> 39:54.601
Goodbye for now, Terrence.

39:58.396 --> 40:02.650
Gentlemen, I believe a visit
to Mr. Hammerton is in order.

40:02.860 --> 40:04.235
Agreed.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.949
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

40:10.159 --> 40:12.452
Does my war machine,
in fact, work?

40:12.661 --> 40:13.954
Of course.

40:14.914 --> 40:15.789
Impossible.

40:15.998 --> 40:18.125
I went back over
Professor Dolomore's notes.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.460
There could be no
analytical engine running it.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.755
But you yourself
witnessed the demonstration!

40:22.963 --> 40:24.798
Did I?

40:25.007 --> 40:26.382
Professor Dolomore caught wind

40:26.592 --> 40:28.677
of your plans
to swindle the government.

40:28.885 --> 40:30.512
He intended to speak
with the prime minister.

40:30.721 --> 40:33.181
- So you had him assassinated.
- That's ridiculous!

40:33.389 --> 40:35.601
You made his murder look
like the work of the Prussians,

40:35.809 --> 40:37.686
further fueling
Mr. Meyers' paranoia,

40:37.894 --> 40:39.771
and thus ensuring
even greater funding.

40:39.980 --> 40:42.358
You killed the dwarf
because he knew too much.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.360
Now, what have you done
with the boy?

40:45.027 --> 40:47.195
- What boy?
- The boy, Mr. Hammerton!

40:47.403 --> 40:50.032
The boy who saw everything!
What have you done with him?

40:50.240 --> 40:54.286
I do not -- I do not know
what you're talking about.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.123
Let me try, Murdoch.

40:57.331 --> 41:00.291
Sir, you claim that my automaton
does in fact work?

41:00.501 --> 41:01.543
Absolutely.

41:01.751 --> 41:03.003
Well, then show us.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.672
Of course.
I --

41:04.880 --> 41:05.755
You have to understand,

41:05.965 --> 41:07.423
Professor Dolomore
was the only one

41:07.632 --> 41:08.759
with the proficiency
and knowledge --

41:08.967 --> 41:11.010
No, no, no.
Now.

41:12.054 --> 41:13.931
Right now.

41:21.981 --> 41:23.858
Where is my automaton?!

41:24.065 --> 41:26.985
I-I don't understand.
It should be here.

41:33.659 --> 41:36.829
Gentlemen,
I believe he went this way.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.043
- Sir!
- George.

41:43.251 --> 41:44.836
Inspector.
What are you doing here?

41:45.045 --> 41:46.338
Sir, there's been reports
of a --

41:46.547 --> 41:49.175
a-a giant metal hooligan
on a rampage.

41:49.382 --> 41:51.177
I thought you said
it didn't work, Murdoch.

41:51.385 --> 41:52.385
It shouldn't.

41:52.594 --> 41:56.431
Well, it bloody well does now!
Come on!

42:28.922 --> 42:31.090
We'll stop this bloody thing.
Crabtree.

42:32.717 --> 42:35.387
Sir, I don't think
that'll be necessary.

42:48.317 --> 42:49.652
Master Jones?

42:51.070 --> 42:52.403
Alwyn.

42:52.612 --> 42:53.447
Are you all right?

42:53.655 --> 42:55.740
I didn't mean to wreck
the giant.

42:56.532 --> 42:57.492
What's happened?

42:57.701 --> 43:01.579
I was coming to see you at the station,
but then I saw you.

43:01.789 --> 43:04.291
I remembered you were down
by the river with the giant.

43:04.500 --> 43:06.460
So I followed you here.

43:06.668 --> 43:07.961
I see.

43:09.545 --> 43:12.298
And how did you get inside
the automaton?

43:12.507 --> 43:14.342
I snuck inside the building.

43:14.550 --> 43:18.137
I know I'm not supposed to snoop,
but I did.

43:18.347 --> 43:20.556
There were people coming,
so I hid in a room.

43:20.766 --> 43:22.934
But they locked me in
by accident.

43:23.143 --> 43:24.853
And he was in there.

43:25.061 --> 43:26.480
And then you got inside.

43:26.688 --> 43:27.690
I wanted to bring him to you

43:27.898 --> 43:29.692
to prove
that I was telling the truth.

43:29.900 --> 43:32.068
Only it took me quite a while
to make him work.

43:33.987 --> 43:36.447
Well done, lad.
Let's get this mess cleared up.

43:36.657 --> 43:37.949
That won't be necessary.

43:38.157 --> 43:40.577
I will be taking
what is rightfully mine.

43:40.786 --> 43:41.661
All of it.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.081
Detective Murdoch,
I surrender myself to you.

43:44.289 --> 43:45.456
Very well.

43:45.666 --> 43:47.876
George, arrest this man.

43:48.085 --> 43:49.003
Step aside, sir.

43:49.210 --> 43:50.920
Actually, gentlemen,

43:51.130 --> 43:52.965
your jurisdiction is
no longer recognized in this case.

43:53.172 --> 43:55.134
Excuse me, Mr. Meyers.

43:55.342 --> 43:57.219
If you have
any further questions,

43:57.427 --> 44:00.014
address them to
the prime minister himself.

44:00.222 --> 44:02.974
And as always, gentlemen,
it has been a pleasure.

44:03.182 --> 44:06.019
You can't let them take me.
You can't!

44:06.228 --> 44:06.936
Sir.

44:07.146 --> 44:08.896
- Murdoch, leave it.
- But --

44:09.106 --> 44:11.108
- That's an order.
- Stop! This is wrong!

44:11.317 --> 44:13.360
You can't --
Aah!

44:14.902 --> 44:16.572
Stop!

44:23.954 --> 44:26.039
I just heard
from the solicitor for the Crown.

44:26.248 --> 44:27.123
And?

44:27.333 --> 44:29.918
Officially,
our investigation is complete.

44:30.126 --> 44:34.172
The incident on Front Street
was drunken unionists rioting.

44:35.590 --> 44:37.592
- So Hammerton gets off?
- Mm.

44:37.800 --> 44:40.554
Meyers has whisked him away
to some secret location.

44:40.762 --> 44:42.181
To punish him
or to do <i>his</i> bidding?

44:42.389 --> 44:43.431
Who knows?

44:43.639 --> 44:44.891
If he builds
another doomsday weapon,

44:45.099 --> 44:46.434
somebody else
will just match it.

44:46.643 --> 44:47.936
Where will it end, Murdoch?

44:48.144 --> 44:49.688
A good question, sir.

44:51.856 --> 44:54.400
I heard there was an automaton.
How fantastic.

44:54.610 --> 44:57.403
It was all a bit anticlimactic
in the end, I'm afraid.

44:57.612 --> 44:58.405
Really?

44:58.614 --> 45:01.115
Still, I'd love to hear
all about it.

45:01.992 --> 45:03.452
William.

45:03.659 --> 45:05.329
I see this case has inspired you

45:05.536 --> 45:07.914
to start reading
about steam men.

45:08.123 --> 45:10.333
It's a gift for a friend.

45:15.130 --> 45:19.635
I have somewhere
that I need to be.

45:21.512 --> 45:24.722
I'm sure the inspector
can give you all of the details.

45:26.307 --> 45:27.684
Of course.

45:30.103 --> 45:31.730
Good evening.

45:35.067 --> 45:36.110
Hmm.

45:38.653 --> 45:42.157
Perhaps a wee nip of scotch
might be in order, Doctor.

45:44.367 --> 45:46.369
Perhaps.

45:49.873 --> 45:51.291
- Mrs. Jones.
- Oh, Detective.

45:51.500 --> 45:54.545
Good evening, Detective Murdoch.

45:54.753 --> 45:57.588
I brought something for Alwyn.

46:02.510 --> 46:04.847
Oh, how thoughtful.

46:07.849 --> 46:09.643
Why am I crying?

46:12.228 --> 46:14.063
You're relieved, I'm sure.

46:16.023 --> 46:17.608
I am.

46:17.818 --> 46:19.777
Very.

46:20.737 --> 46:22.364
Detective Murdoch.

46:22.572 --> 46:24.574
Please, call me William.

46:26.034 --> 46:26.994
William.

46:27.202 --> 46:29.454
Much better.

46:30.706 --> 46:33.041
I hope you like pot roast, William.

46:33.250 --> 46:36.253
I do, very much.

46:44.177 --> 46:46.804
Well, this is my home.

46:47.014 --> 46:48.974
- After you.
- Oh, thank you.

46:50.266 --> 46:51.559
Oh, oh.
