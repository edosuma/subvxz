WEBVTT

00:04.713 --> 00:05.088
.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.047
- So he killed
at least five women,

00:07.215 --> 00:09.342
but the police
only found four bodies.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.593
- And it's ten episodes?
- Mm-hmm.

00:10.635 --> 00:12.595
And apparently,
they get the sister to talk.

00:12.637 --> 00:14.222
- Yep, it's gonna be
my entire weekend.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.223
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.516
Where are you all headed?

00:16.558 --> 00:18.059
Did you see
the stock's back up this week?

00:18.101 --> 00:20.020
We should celebrate.
Let's go for drinks.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.147
- Together,
or in our separate homes?

00:22.188 --> 00:23.690
- There's that cool new
bar lounge place

00:23.732 --> 00:24.983
that just opened up.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.359
Sadie, you could feed
your cats, meet us there?

00:26.401 --> 00:28.445
- Oh, I don't have cats.
- Really?

00:28.486 --> 00:29.738
What's with
the whole vibe then?

00:29.779 --> 00:31.031
- Um...
- Oh, hey.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.365
Dori,
we're gonna go get drinks.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.492
- Is this, like,
a mandatory work thing?

00:34.534 --> 00:36.995
- No, it's just kind of a fun
team player kind of thing.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.289
[forced laughter]
- So I'm going?

00:39.330 --> 00:42.208
- Good God, we should have
done this earlier.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.835
Ooh, hey, Elliot. Hi.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.170
We're going for drinks.
You're coming.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.504
- Oh, I'd love to,

00:46.546 --> 00:48.173
but actually my parents
are in town tonight.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.883
Yeah, I haven't seen them
for a while, you know,

00:49.924 --> 00:52.218
but they're stopping over on
their way to Puerto Vallarta,

00:52.260 --> 00:54.179
you know, so...

00:55.430 --> 00:57.349
So I'll come for a drink.
- Great.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.725
- Uh, what's going on?

00:58.767 --> 01:00.810
- Oh, nothing.
- I heard someone say "drinks."

01:00.852 --> 01:02.395
- Uh, yeah, I did.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.064
- Sick! I'm in!

01:04.105 --> 01:06.232
Oh, I finally get
to be your wingman.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.901
It'll be an honor
to watch you work.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.569
- Don't think it's gonna
be that type of night.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.571
- Can you imagine
the runoff this guy gets?

01:11.613 --> 01:14.949
Even his leftovers
gotta be eights or nines.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.993
<i>- * Bom bom</i>
<i>bom-bom-bom-bom-bom *</i>

01:17.035 --> 01:19.454
<i>* Buh buh bom-bom-bom</i>
<i>buh bom-bom-bom-bom *</i>

01:19.496 --> 01:22.457
<i>[chorus vocalizing]</i>

01:22.499 --> 01:24.042
- Wow, this place is nice.
- Ooh.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.503
- Yeah, it's trendy, but it
doesn't feel like it's trying.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.588
- I like that the music
isn't, you know, too loud.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.590
- Oh, excuse me, ma'am,
the bus to the old folks' home

01:30.632 --> 01:32.425
is waiting for you
right outside.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.593
- Somebody give Sadie
a flashlight

01:33.635 --> 01:35.595
so she can see the menu.
[laughter]

01:35.637 --> 01:37.639
- Do they serve
Ensure martinis here?

01:37.681 --> 01:38.932
- Right, right.

01:38.973 --> 01:41.101
- Uh, you're lame as [bleep].

01:41.142 --> 01:42.852
- Oh.
- Nice.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.854
- I'm joking, okay?
She's like a sister to me.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.314
Come here, you big goon.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.941
[phone buzzing]
- Oh, my parents.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.527
Probably wondering where I am.
Killing the buzz, as usual.

01:50.568 --> 01:53.154
- Um, I'm gonna get us a table,
and let's do some shots.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.447
Are shots still a thing?

01:54.489 --> 01:56.282
- Is pouring alcohol in a cup
still a thing?

01:56.324 --> 01:57.575
I believe
it's still being done.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.869
- Amazing.
Order us a round of shots.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.454
Whoo!
[forced laughter]

02:01.496 --> 02:03.123
- Uh, is she acting weird?
- Yeah.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.499
Her energy's off.
She's, like--

02:04.541 --> 02:06.459
- Horny.
- Ew, but yeah, kind of.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.794
- Okay. How long do y'all
think this is gonna go?

02:07.836 --> 02:10.046
Because my grandmama has
a birthday party tonight.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.631
- Uh, well,
I'm in it to win it.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.133
Jack, you don't have a date
or anything, right?

02:13.174 --> 02:14.467
- Nope.
- Noice!

02:14.509 --> 02:15.969
And I assume
Sadie has no plans.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.804
- It's Friday night.
Of course I have plans.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.514
I am...

02:19.556 --> 02:20.849
- You could make up
literally anything.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.892
- Yeah,
that's what made it so hard.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.019
- Mm.
<i>- Yeah, so just,</i>

02:24.060 --> 02:24.978
you know,
let yourselves in, okay?

02:25.020 --> 02:26.021
Have a little rest.

02:26.062 --> 02:26.980
You must be pretty jetlagged

02:27.022 --> 02:27.981
with all the traveling.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.357
Uh, Mum, all right.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.276
Well, let's not get
too dramatic, all right?

02:31.317 --> 02:33.820
I just saw all of you
last Christmas.

02:33.862 --> 02:37.073
Well, I think
Zoom does count, actually.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.992
- One, two, three. Shots!

02:39.034 --> 02:41.202
- That's how you drink shots,
by yelling "shots."

02:41.244 --> 02:43.663
- Mmm.
- Oh, Sadie's sipping.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.165
- You can't tattle on me
for sipping.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.332
I'll drink it how I want to.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.334
- No, he's right.
Sack up, Sadie.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.835
Come on. All right.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.837
Let's each go around the horn
and share something.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.714
Cyrus, go.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.674
- Okay, um...

02:54.716 --> 02:56.343
there's some
interesting AI software

02:56.384 --> 02:57.552
that I'm looking
into licensing.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.929
- [imitates buzzer]
Boring. No shop talk.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.681
Come on.
Share something about yourself.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.808
- I really don't have anything.
- Oh, come on.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.102
We barely know each other
outside of work.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.479
Let's all
say something personal,

03:07.520 --> 03:09.397
you know, something you've
never told anyone before.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.733
Come on.
- Come on.

03:11.775 --> 03:12.692
- [sighs]

03:12.734 --> 03:14.736
I took a 23andMe, and it says

03:14.778 --> 03:17.364
that I might have that gene
for colorectal cancer.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.367
- Well, that's kind of
a downer.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.701
It's not exactly
what I was looking for.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.203
All right, Dori, save us.
- Uh...

03:23.244 --> 03:24.496
never seen "Titanic."

03:24.537 --> 03:26.206
- No way! Me either!
- What?

03:26.247 --> 03:27.415
- So seeing a movie qualifies?

03:27.457 --> 03:28.583
You asked
for something personal.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.627
- Jack, go.
- Uh...[exhales sharply]

03:30.669 --> 03:32.712
I like blue velvet cake
more than red velvet cake.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.381
[laughter]
- That's crazy!

03:34.422 --> 03:36.508
- But it's the same flavor.

03:36.549 --> 03:37.967
- What did I miss?

03:38.009 --> 03:39.636
- We're digging deep,
getting to know each other.

03:39.678 --> 03:42.222
- Uh, Jack likes blue velvet
more than red velvet

03:42.263 --> 03:43.807
and Cyrus is gonna die.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.059
- All right, jump in, Elliot.
Tell us about your real self.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.852
- Okay, well, here's a fun one.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.730
When I was nine,
a bully shattered my clavicle

03:50.772 --> 03:52.190
with a croquet mallet.
- Whoa.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.275
All right, now that's the kind
of thing I'm looking for.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.611
- Oh, my buddy had
his clavicle removed

03:56.653 --> 03:58.238
so he could do oral on himself.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.782
- I think that's ribs.
- No, it's--

04:00.824 --> 04:02.659
wait, hold on.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.202
Oh, yeah.
You're probably right.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.453
- Yeah, it's ribs.
It's ribs.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.663
All right,
let's get another round.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.124
Hello...
- God, shoot me.

04:09.165 --> 04:11.042
- Ooh, I'm a huge Sudokuer.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.253
- Oh, truly I'm obsessed
with it.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.421
- I'm not, like,
a nerd about it.

04:14.462 --> 04:15.880
- No. No, of course not. No.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.924
Yeah, not like
I'm in a league or anything.

04:17.966 --> 04:18.967
[both laugh]

04:19.009 --> 04:20.135
- Hey.
- Hmm?

04:20.176 --> 04:21.928
- Dark bar.
You should cover your drink.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.096
- Thanks.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.305
- Yeah, I've just been noticing

04:24.347 --> 04:26.182
how wide open
that drink's been.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.809
- You have?
- Mm-hmm.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.602
- How late do we need
to stay at this thing?

04:29.644 --> 04:31.604
- I think we can leave
whenever we want to.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.189
- I'm not gonna be the first
to get up, though.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.566
- Mm-mm.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.192
- Well, we'll all get up
on the count of three.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.569
- Okay.
- One, two...

04:37.610 --> 04:38.862
all:
Three.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.533
- What's up?

04:43.575 --> 04:46.202
- Cramp in my leg,
so I'm stretching it out.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.454
Don't want to get a blood clot.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.330
[chuckles nervously]

04:49.372 --> 04:51.082
- Chicken.
- You are!

04:51.124 --> 04:52.959
- Are you guys hungry?
We should get menus.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.336
Excuse me. Hi there.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.670
Could we get some menus,
please?

04:55.712 --> 04:57.797
- Oh, great, food.
- Oh, my God.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.175
- I'm so sorry, we actually
need to close you out.

05:00.216 --> 05:01.426
We have a private event later.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.969
- Oh, no.
- Aw, rats.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.387
- That's too bad.
- What private event?

05:04.429 --> 05:06.806
The Party Poopers
of America Convention?

05:06.848 --> 05:08.600
- You know what? We should just
keep this going at my house.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.268
Yeah.
- Yes, I'm in.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.728
- Your house? Tonight?

05:11.770 --> 05:13.188
- Yeah, we're just
getting started.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.147
I mean, this is gonna be fun.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.982
I will go settle the tab.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.068
- Thank you.
- Pay that tab, homegirl.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.488
- Chug 'em if you got 'em.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.325
- My grandmama gonna be pissed
if I miss her birthday.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.493
She ain't got that many left.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.370
- Hey, wait.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.829
Should we be worried?

05:29.871 --> 05:32.999
Katherine has never once
asked us to do anything social,

05:33.041 --> 05:35.502
and now she's, like,
desperate for us to come over?

05:35.543 --> 05:37.837
- Is she moving?
- What?

05:37.879 --> 05:39.714
- Y'all, if I miss
my grandmama birthday

05:39.756 --> 05:42.676
to help her move [bleep],
I'm going to lose my mind.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.010
- Hey, you made it!

05:44.052 --> 05:46.054
All right!
Let's get this party started!

05:46.096 --> 05:48.848
both: Hey.
- What, are you moving out?

05:48.890 --> 05:51.810
- Oh, no, just Richard is.
We're getting divorced.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.645
[sighs]

05:53.687 --> 05:54.896
You guys just gonna
stand there all night?

06:01.778 --> 06:01.986
.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.154
- Sorry for the mess.
It's usually a lot nicer

06:03.738 --> 06:05.031
in here.
Oh, yeah.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.324
Like, you see those dents
in the carpet over there?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.617
Just picture, uh,

06:07.659 --> 06:10.203
three chrome nesting tables
stacked together.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.580
They're great.
Really anchor the...space.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.374
- Totally makes the room.
- Sounds nice.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.709
- Hello.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.127
What is this?
- Hi, Richard. Hi.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.629
I just invited a bunch
of my friends over from work.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.131
- Tonight?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.590
Oh, I'm sorry.
Should I have run that by you?

06:22.632 --> 06:24.509
Oh, wait.
You don't live here anymore.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.677
- No, you just do
whatever you want.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.761
- Yeah.
- Like you always do.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.722
- I will.
I'll do that, yeah.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.432
- Oh, if this is a bad time,
we can go--

06:30.473 --> 06:32.142
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It's a perfectly good time.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.977
Richard was supposed
to be done hours ago.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.770
The fact that he's here
isn't my fault,

06:35.812 --> 06:37.731
just like his many shortcomings
aren't my fault.

06:37.772 --> 06:38.857
- Oh, that's funny.
Yeah, should we talk

06:38.898 --> 06:40.358
about the things
that aren't my fault?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.860
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.571
Her narcissism, for example,
is not my fault, right?

06:44.612 --> 06:46.031
Her clinical depression,
not my fault.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.199
- Well, this one has OCD.
- That's not my fault.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.242
[argument continues]

06:49.284 --> 06:51.036
- Feels weird
to be watching this.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.621
- Yes, I believe it is
basic house guest etiquette

06:53.663 --> 06:55.040
not to stare directly
at a couple

06:55.081 --> 06:56.624
while they're
actively divorcing.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.128
- Okay, while y'all figure this
out, I'm just gonna slink--

07:00.170 --> 07:01.379
- Oh, no, Cyrus, don't.
- No, Cyrus.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.673
- Cyrus, no, no, no, no.
- That makes it worse.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.008
- I can't even
slice a bagel correctly!

07:05.050 --> 07:06.885
- You don't cut it
like a normal person.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.553
Normal people slice it...

07:08.595 --> 07:10.096
- I don't think
this is any better.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.057
- Did you know
they were getting a divorce?

07:12.098 --> 07:13.850
- There's
a confidentiality agreement

07:13.892 --> 07:15.352
between a boss
and an assistant.

07:15.393 --> 07:18.480
I can't just reveal what's
going on in her personal life.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.898
- You didn't know.
- No.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.483
I would've told all of y'all.
- What are you doing?

07:21.524 --> 07:23.860
- I'm not gonna make it through
this night without alcohol.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.403
- You find anything good?
- Some white wine vinegar,

07:25.445 --> 07:28.907
skin care products,
and some expired hot sauce.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.241
- Wow, sorry about that.
I was just working

07:30.283 --> 07:32.077
on a couple little logistics.
- Oh, no.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.244
- What fighting?
- Totally fine.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.288
- Hey,
let's get this party started!

07:35.330 --> 07:36.623
Who wants music?

07:36.664 --> 07:38.083
Uh, I don't know.
What do you guys like?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.584
Elliot, what music do you like?

07:39.626 --> 07:41.878
- Well, I like all music, so...
- But what's your fav?

07:41.920 --> 07:43.338
Like, what's your jam?
- Uh...

07:43.380 --> 07:45.048
just, you know,
just, like, everything.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.508
Kind of equally.
Kind of, eh!

07:46.549 --> 07:47.801
- Do you not have a soul,
or are you

07:47.842 --> 07:49.219
just too frightened
to have an opinion?

07:49.260 --> 07:50.512
- Both.
- Okay.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.681
All right, we're gonna
get up in the club now.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.808
Here we go. Let's get funky.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.018
Oh, shoot. Shoot.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.562
Richard's the one that usually
deals with the Wi-Fi speakers.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.814
- Want me to go ask him?
- Oh, no.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.482
[scoffs]
We're divorcing.

08:02.524 --> 08:03.900
You know, kind of bad timing.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.568
The timing, it's eh.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.320
- Anyway, sorry.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.448
- [clicking tongue]

08:10.490 --> 08:12.742
- Oh, I know.
Why don't we go in the Jacuzzi?

08:12.784 --> 08:14.327
- Yes, we should
totally hot tub it up.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.246
"Hot Tub Time Machine,"
am I right?

08:16.287 --> 08:17.914
- Right about what?
You just named a movie.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.916
- Darn it.
I don't have no bathing suit.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.626
- Uh, we don't need 'em.
- Yeah.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.752
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we do.

08:22.794 --> 08:23.920
- You can
just borrow one of mine.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.046
I have so many.
- Mm.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.048
That's too bad for us guys,
though.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.175
Sounds like it's gonna be
a ladies night kind of thing.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.760
I'm so jealous
'cause I really wish

08:30.802 --> 08:31.928
that I could get
in that hot tub.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.388
But you know what?
Next time,

08:33.430 --> 08:35.640
I'ma get boozy in the Jacuzzi
with you Katherine, okay?

08:35.682 --> 08:36.766
Good night.
- [laughs]

08:36.808 --> 08:38.268
Oh, you know what?
- Hmm?

08:38.309 --> 08:41.062
- Oh, there are so many bathing
suits in the Goodwill box

08:41.104 --> 08:42.147
that Richard was giving away.
- Yeah?

08:42.188 --> 08:43.690
- Let me go check.
- Okay.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.275
All right.
- How about that?

08:45.316 --> 08:47.485
You got to stop saying
you want to stay at places

08:47.527 --> 08:49.863
you don't really want to stay.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.032
- Yeah, Mum, look,
I want to see you too.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.992
It's just that I'm
at the CEO's house right now.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.326
It's kind of a big deal.
Everyone's here.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.786
I can't exactly leave.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.163
What do you mean you're hungry?

08:58.204 --> 09:00.290
What happened to the
Stouffer's I left for you?

09:00.331 --> 09:01.499
You microwaved it.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.251
Okay, well,
if you treat it like [bleep],

09:03.293 --> 09:04.461
it'll taste like [bleep].

09:04.502 --> 09:06.504
- I think I've got some suits

09:06.546 --> 09:08.298
for you to wear in the closet.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.674
- Great.
- Yeah.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.926
- Whoo!
[chuckles]

09:11.968 --> 09:13.303
How long do you think
this is gonna go for?

09:13.345 --> 09:15.472
- I'm thinking 5 minutes
to get changed,

09:15.513 --> 09:17.891
20 in the tub,
12 to dry off, say goodbye.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.225
And we're out of here
in 37 minutes.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.102
- Nice. Nice.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.605
- Ain't it not sanitary to wear
somebody else's bathing suit?

09:23.646 --> 09:24.981
- I think it's fine.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.900
- My mama always told me
to keep my underwear on

09:26.941 --> 09:28.360
when I tried on swimsuits
at the mall.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.444
That's why I said that.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.987
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That makes sense.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.573
- She also told me red lipstick
would make me a whore.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.325
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.743
- Uh-huh.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.665
- Hey.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.335
- Nice suit.
- Yeah.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.837
Uh, Katherine said
it was in a donate box.

09:47.879 --> 09:48.880
But I can--
- It's all yours.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.882
Just enjoy.
- Thank you.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.425
It's a great suit.
- Mm-hmm.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.885
- It's just
the right amount of pockets.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.096
This one even has zippers,
which I can put snacks--

09:56.137 --> 09:57.889
- You know what?
I'm gonna take off.

10:11.152 --> 10:14.197
I can't figure these jets out.
I don't really use the hot tub.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.949
- I actually like
how it's perfectly still.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.826
You can really see everything.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.038
- So when did you and Richard
decide to get a div--

10:22.080 --> 10:23.164
- Oh, I don't want
to talk about Richard.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.457
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, no.
- Yeah.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.834
- Let's talk about other stuff.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.752
[chuckles]
- Yes.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.714
- So, Cyrus, so how are things
progressing with the EV stuff?

10:30.755 --> 10:32.632
- I thought
you said no shop talk.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.134
- I did. I did. I did.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.552
- But we could talk about it
if you want to.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.845
- No, no, no, no, it's my rule.
I'm sticking to it.

10:36.886 --> 10:37.887
No shop talk.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.597
Tonight is about bonding
and fun.

- Yeah.

10:40.807 --> 10:41.975
- Yeah.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.980
- Anyone see that documentary
about the Uyghurs?

10:47.022 --> 10:48.898
- Oh, no, I've been meaning to.
Is it any good?

10:48.940 --> 10:51.693
- I haven't seen it.
- Ah.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.737
- Uh, I-I heard
it's pretty sad.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.823
Yeah, lots of people being
mistreated really badly there.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.367
- Wow.
- That's pretty...sad.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.413

- Oh.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.291
- Uh, jets are kicking in.

11:10.128 --> 11:13.840
- So are we just gonna keep
sitting in this fart water?

11:13.882 --> 11:16.593
- As much as I've enjoyed this
deranged social experiment,

11:16.634 --> 11:17.677
I'm gonna go.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.263
- Ah, hey.
all: Hey.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.931
- I just love
that post-hot tub feeling.

11:21.973 --> 11:22.932
- Yeah, it's great
'cause you're not

11:22.974 --> 11:24.100
in a hot tub anymore.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.102
- [chuckles]

11:26.144 --> 11:27.437
- Next? Like, after now?

11:27.479 --> 11:28.897
- You know what?
We should play a board game.

Do you guys like board games?

11:30.565 --> 11:31.775

11:33.943 --> 11:35.070
- Oh, wait, what's this one?
- Oh, my God.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.030
- Warhammer: Owls of Asgard,

11:37.072 --> 11:39.699
which I think involves us
painting our own pieces.

11:39.741 --> 11:40.950
- Oh, wow, look at the time.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.952
I gotta get up early for...

- Oh.
- Ah, gotta feed the cats.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.417
- Yeah, maybe we just call it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.585
Of course.
Of course, it's late.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.921
Of course. Go home.
I'm sorry. Yes, yes.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.422
- We can stay
if you want us to.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.341
- Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.218
No, go home.
Enjoy your weekend.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.136
I've gotta catch up
on my binging anyway.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.971
See you Monday.
both: Okay.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.973
- Night-night. Thank you.
- Good night. Thank you.

12:04.015 --> 12:05.558
Such a good time.
- Mm.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.976
- All right.

12:07.018 --> 12:11.981
Who is in what
tennis game tonight? [chuckles]

12:12.023 --> 12:13.942
- Katherine,
you sure you're good?

12:13.983 --> 12:15.318
- Oh, yes, of course. Yeah.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.528
No, no, I just don't know
how to use remotes,

12:16.569 --> 12:18.571
so I-I just
watch my shows on this.

12:18.613 --> 12:19.823
Night, guys. Take care.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.324
You guys know the way out.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.785
- You know what?
I think I'm gonna stay.

12:23.827 --> 12:24.786
- You know what? Me too.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.079
- You guys, it's fine.

12:26.121 --> 12:27.622
I know how to be alone.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.499
- No, I'd rather hang out here.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.167
- Yeah, and if Jack's staying,
I'm staying.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.877
I'm not gonna go do a pub crawl
by myself.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.046
- Wasn't gonna do that.
- Right, because we're staying.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.631
- My parents are probably
asleep on the furniture

12:36.673 --> 12:38.008
in my apartment, so
I don't want to wake them up.

12:38.049 --> 12:41.428
- Oh.
- Night's shot to hell anyway.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.763

some booze or something.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.099
all: Yes.

- You have a whole case
of Pappy Van Winkle?

12:48.351 --> 12:50.145
This is, like,
six figures' worth of bourbon.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.146
- You know what?
Help yourself.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.439
There's wine. There's cigars.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.190
There's caviar.
There's gourmet cheeses.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.358
- It's like a doomsday bunker

12:55.400 --> 12:57.235
for the most fun
apocalypse ever.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.445
- Yeah,
if this was the apocalypse,

12:58.486 --> 12:59.904
it's weird to think
that we'd have

12:59.946 --> 13:01.614
to repopulate the Earth.

13:08.288 --> 13:08.496
.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.040
- Uh, this is a $10,000 bottle
of Château Lafite Rothschild.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.334
- It was a Christmas gift
to Richard.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.752
- Well, hell,
if that's how you treat a man,

13:13.793 --> 13:15.086
I'll marry you.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.380
- Well, I am available.
[laughter, chatter]

13:17.422 --> 13:19.591
- Mm-mm.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.759
That is way too salty.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.218
- Yeah, dude, it's caviar.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.220
- So basically,
this one glass of wine

13:24.262 --> 13:26.514
is worth two brand-new iPhones?
- Mm-hmm.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.351
- Worth it.
Fill me up, Elliot.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.640
<i>* That will be</i>
<i>the best therapy... *</i>

14:08.682 --> 14:10.684
- Oh!
- Hey!

14:10.725 --> 14:14.437
<i>- * All the crazy things</i>
<i>I did tonight *</i>

14:14.479 --> 14:17.774
<i>* Those'll be</i>
<i>the best memories *</i>

14:17.816 --> 14:20.443
[playing
Beethoven's "Fur Elise"]

14:20.485 --> 14:22.654
* *

14:22.696 --> 14:25.115
- What song is this?
- Oh, it's an original.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.033
- Wow, you made that up?
- Yeah.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.952
- That's great.

14:28.993 --> 14:32.872
<i>- * I just wanna let it go</i>
<i>for tonight *</i>

14:32.914 --> 14:36.668
<i>* That will be</i>
<i>the best therapy for me *</i>

14:37.419 --> 14:41.131
- * You're the best man
I'll ever know *

14:41.172 --> 14:44.843
* There's no way
I could ever go *

14:44.884 --> 14:47.637
* Darling, there's no way *

14:47.679 --> 14:52.642
* No, no, no, no way
I'm living without you *

14:52.684 --> 14:53.977
- Hey, check it out.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.146
I'm Edward Chablis-hands.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.731
- Stop, Wesley.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.733
I have to text my grandma
and tell her I can't make it

14:59.774 --> 15:01.776
to her birthday party.
She gon' be pissed.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.069
- Won't she understand
if you told her

15:03.111 --> 15:04.362
it's, like, a work emergency?

15:04.404 --> 15:05.739
- She knows
I'm just an assistant.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.198
That's not an important job.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.704
What are you doing?

15:12.746 --> 15:15.331
- Hey, Mary,
I need someone to drop off

15:15.373 --> 15:18.918
a 2023 executive-class Palermo
to, uh...

15:18.960 --> 15:19.961
what's your grandma's address?

15:20.003 --> 15:22.005
- 146 Lincoln Street.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.256
- 146 Lincoln Street.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.966
Do the leather seats.
All the options.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.844
And write a note that says,
"Sorry we needed Dori tonight.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.929
"We couldn't run this company
without her.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.306
Happy birthday.
From Payne."

15:31.348 --> 15:32.515
- "Dori will get married."

15:32.557 --> 15:34.851
- "And Dori will get married."

15:34.893 --> 15:36.186
Yeah, I need it tonight.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.396
Thank you, Mary.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.024
- Oh, my God.
[laughs]

15:41.066 --> 15:42.400
Thank you, Wesley.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.860
- [as Edward Scissorhands]
Who's Wesley?

15:43.902 --> 15:45.487
- Thank you, Edward.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.238
- You're welcome.
[chuckles]

15:47.280 --> 15:48.865
- Hey, your hands
are really red.

15:48.907 --> 15:51.034
- It's really tight, actually.
I need some scissors, I think.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.494
- Yeah, okay, let me get some.

15:52.535 --> 15:53.745
- Oh, God.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.497
- Yeah, Hillary Clinton
gave me this one

15:55.538 --> 15:58.416
for something woman-y.
I can't remember.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.752
- Oh, is that you and the pope?
- Yes, His Holiness.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.420
We, uh--we met
a couple years ago.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.214
- Wow. What was he like?
- Gassy.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.548
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:05.590 --> 16:06.591
- That's so funny.
I'd heard that before.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.259
- Big time.
- Somewhere else.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.553
- Yeah.
- And what's this one?

16:10.595 --> 16:11.930
- Oh. [chuckles]

16:11.971 --> 16:14.182
Uh, those are the burial plots

16:14.224 --> 16:16.226
that Richard and I
bought for ourselves.

16:16.267 --> 16:19.020
Won't be needing those anymore.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.064
I actually have
six burial plots,

16:21.106 --> 16:22.315
two for each marriage,

16:22.357 --> 16:23.983
and I'm gonna end up
being buried alone

16:24.025 --> 16:25.068
next to a bunch of cats.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.736
- Ooh. Like the pharaohs.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.071
- [chuckles]

16:28.113 --> 16:29.572
- You know, um,

16:29.614 --> 16:31.282
being divorced doesn't have
as much stigma anymore.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.743
I mean, I've been divorced.
- Once. Big deal.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.246
I mean,
everyone's been divorced once.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.373
Maybe I'm just
not marriage material.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.708
- Oh, no. Come on.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.292
How about this?
Here's the deal.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.961
In 20 years' time,
if we're both single,

16:43.003 --> 16:44.087
we'll marry each other.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.506
[chuckles]

16:46.548 --> 16:48.091
- [sobbing]
- Oh, Katherine.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.135
Oh, hey. It's all right.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.178
You don't have to marry me.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.014
- * Tear down the mountains *

16:54.055 --> 16:55.682
* Yell, scream, and shout *

16:55.724 --> 16:57.475
* You can say what you want *

16:57.517 --> 16:59.477
* I'm not walkin' out *

17:00.103 --> 17:01.813
- Don't jump.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.565
[both chuckle]

17:03.606 --> 17:05.483
- Just taking in the scenery.
- Yeah.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.110
- You want to join me?
- How's the water?

17:07.152 --> 17:09.446
- Oh, it's nice.
- Oh.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.989
Oh, my God, it's freezing.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.782
That is freezing.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.784
- Yeah, but if I told you that,
you wouldn't have joined me.

17:14.826 --> 17:15.952
- No.

17:15.994 --> 17:18.121
- [sighs]

17:18.163 --> 17:19.956
- Good moon tonight.
- Mm-hmm.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.583
- I like a crescent.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.752
The full moon,
eh, it's a little braggy.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.338
It's like, we get it.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.214
- We gonna talk about last week
at some point?

17:28.256 --> 17:30.675
- Mm, you mean
the sex in the car thing

17:30.717 --> 17:33.428
or the fact that Dale
wore mismatched socks twice?

17:33.470 --> 17:36.222
- [chuckles]
Both of those are crazy.

17:37.265 --> 17:40.060
- I mean, I like you.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.312
I just--I always swore

17:42.354 --> 17:44.481
that I would never date someone
that I work with.

17:44.522 --> 17:45.899
But then I always think,

17:45.940 --> 17:48.485
well, I'm spending so much time
at work.

17:48.526 --> 17:49.903
If I don't date
someone I work with,

17:49.944 --> 17:52.947
am I just
swearing off dating altogether?

17:54.282 --> 17:57.619
And I also think that...

17:57.660 --> 18:00.455
[sighs]

18:00.497 --> 18:02.624
I don't know what I think.

18:03.875 --> 18:07.587
- Well, when you decide,
you know where to find me.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.008
- * I'm stayin' *

18:12.050 --> 18:14.219
* I'm stayin' *

18:14.260 --> 18:17.305
* And you, and you, and you *

18:17.347 --> 18:18.932
* You're gonna love *

18:18.973 --> 18:20.975
* Oh, ah, ah, ah *

18:21.017 --> 18:22.018
[inhales deeply]

18:22.060 --> 18:27.023
* Me *

18:27.065 --> 18:28.942
* Yeah *

18:28.983 --> 18:31.277
* Oh, ah *

18:31.319 --> 18:33.530
Thank you so much.
Next, we're gonna

18:38.702 --> 18:38.910
.

18:38.952 --> 18:39.369
- I love a fire.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.663
- I bet our ancestors

18:41.705 --> 18:43.707
sat around fires
just like this.

18:43.748 --> 18:46.334
- Yeah, they were always
buying [bleep] from West Elm.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.378
- It's the first time
I've ever used it.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.046
And that's the irony:
you work your butt off

18:50.088 --> 18:51.423
to afford a big house,

18:51.464 --> 18:53.049
and then you're working
too hard to enjoy it.

18:53.091 --> 18:54.175
[scoffs]
- Mm.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.510
- Do you ever think about

18:55.552 --> 18:57.345
what else you could've done
with your life?

18:57.387 --> 18:59.556
- I used to want
to be an architect.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.182
- Oh, really?
- At one point or another,

19:01.224 --> 19:02.767
I think most young,
gay boys do.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.311
- You know, it's probably
the whole Mike Brady thing.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.188
- I sort of always wanted
to go to New York

19:07.230 --> 19:08.481
and do the fashion thing.

19:08.523 --> 19:09.607
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.484
Or, I don't know,
become a therapist.

19:11.526 --> 19:12.527
- That seems better.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.070
- I used to want to be a pilot.

19:14.112 --> 19:15.822
Or an athlete.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.073
Or a detective.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.116
Or a policeman.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.451
Or a fireman.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.161
Or an astronaut.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.288
- So anything a seven-year-old
wants to be when he grows up.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.165
- Oh, or something
with dinosaurs.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.584
- Oh, a paleontologist.
- No.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.127
- Elliot, your turn.
- Let me guess.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.837
Haberdasher.
- Cheesemonger.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.005
- Chimneysweep.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.381
- Yes, very droll, everybody.
Well done.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.799
Please continue
to make hilarious jokes

19:34.841 --> 19:36.426
about how British
and effete I am.

19:36.468 --> 19:38.053
- Okay.
What did you want to be?

19:38.094 --> 19:40.764
- Well, if you must know,
I wanted to be a chiropodist.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.932
- A what?
- It's like a podiatrist.

19:42.974 --> 19:45.935
Basically--essentially,
I mean, it's a podiatrist.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.480
- Now why would you want to go
and do something like that?

19:48.521 --> 19:50.774
- Uh, chiropodists
make a lot of money.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.568
- That is the most random
[bleep] thing I've ever heard.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.445
- Jack, what about you?
What would your life be

19:55.487 --> 19:58.490
if you weren't an assembly line
worker that I hit with a car?

19:58.531 --> 20:00.617
- I don't know.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.077
- Like, what did you want to be
when you were a kid?

20:02.118 --> 20:04.329
- You know, I never
really thought about it.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.456
I just kind of take things
as they come.

20:06.498 --> 20:07.624
- You don't plan anything?

20:07.665 --> 20:09.042
How does a person
live that way?

20:09.084 --> 20:12.420
- Well, a year ago,
I was a factory worker.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.963
Now I'm sitting
in front of a fire pit

20:14.005 --> 20:16.633
outside of a mansion
with a Cuban cigar in one hand

20:16.675 --> 20:18.176
and a hundred-year-old scotch
in the other,

20:18.218 --> 20:21.054
so things
just kind of work out.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.516
- But for real,
was there, like,

20:24.557 --> 20:25.975
a foot doctor in your family
or something?

20:26.017 --> 20:27.811
Like, I'm trying
to wrap my head around it.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.730
- It's just--it's a
recession-proof business.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.901
It's too late to come home now.
I've called you a SuperShuttle.

20:34.943 --> 20:36.986
Oh, it takes you
to the airport.

20:37.028 --> 20:38.780
It just doesn't take you
to the terminal.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.282
You know, taxi's, like, $40.

20:41.324 --> 20:42.826
I'm not made of money.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.869
- This is the softest blanket
I've ever touched.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.329
It's merino wool.

20:46.371 --> 20:47.664
- They wick moisture.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.082
That's why they're good.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.667
'Cause they wick.
- Okay.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.043
- I'm gonna take mine home.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.753
She's not gonna notice.

20:55.547 --> 20:56.673
- I love you guys.

20:56.715 --> 20:57.674
- Mm-mm.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.509
- Oh, gosh.
Tonight was fun.

20:59.551 --> 21:01.636
Did everybody have fun?
- It was fun.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.096
- It was.
- [chuckles]

21:03.138 --> 21:04.347
Good. I'm glad.

21:04.389 --> 21:05.890
Good night.

21:05.932 --> 21:06.975
- Night.

21:08.351 --> 21:09.644
- Good night.

21:14.983 --> 21:16.401
- You guys want
to be buried next to me?

21:16.443 --> 21:18.361
- Excuse me?
- Like, now?

21:18.403 --> 21:19.320
- No. No, just someday.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.197
- Oh, okay.

21:21.239 --> 21:22.449
- Great.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.284
[chuckles]
It'll be great.

21:24.325 --> 21:25.577
I'm looking forward to that.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.162
[groans] Night.
- Good night.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.538
- [chuckles]
