I just received this letter from
the County Athletic Board.

03:06.769 --> 03:10.064
Apparently, Mack Scully dusted
off some old rule books

03:28.791 --> 03:30.460
- I'm afraid so.

03:30.543 --> 03:33.129
I called the Athletic Board.
Uh, it's a technicality.

03:33.212 --> 03:36.966
But because no one's ever
updated the rule,

03:37.050 --> 03:38.301
they have to enforce it.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.637
- But no one even knew this
stupid rule existed.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.930
- Yeah, no one except
Mack Scully.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.474
He's one of those old-timers

03:44.557 --> 03:46.392
who believe in boys
on the football field

03:46.476 --> 03:48.311

03:48.394 --> 03:51.022
- [laughs] Well, you won't find
this girl in the kitchen.

03:51.105 --> 03:55.276
And it's not because I made
that bad batch of cookies.

Yeah, but let's not
tell the boys yet.

in such a good mood

04:04.494 --> 04:06.162

about changing the rule.

That's like the entire
population of Silverado.

we can do it.
