00:11.245 --> 00:16.083
( <i>Clicking</i> )

00:21.188 --> 00:23.590
( <i>whistling tune</i> )

00:23.590 --> 00:25.993
Spellman, this
has got to stop.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.561
This is the third night
you've woken me up

00:27.561 --> 00:28.962
because you
can't sleep.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.731
Well, third
night's the charm.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.799
Look, something's
obviously bothering you.

00:32.799 --> 00:33.901
What's going on?

00:33.901 --> 00:35.802
Nothing. I just can't sleep.

00:35.802 --> 00:37.271
I know the feeling.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.039
I'll be on the couch.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.240
And don't tell me
nothing's wrong.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.808
You've been in
a funk for a week.

00:41.808 --> 00:43.610
Even your perkiness
has lost its pop.

00:43.610 --> 00:44.745
That is so
not true.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.680
I'm at the popping peak
of my perkiness.

00:46.680 --> 00:47.814
I'm totally funkless.

00:47.814 --> 00:51.785
Absolutely nothing
is bothering me.

00:55.789 --> 00:59.259
Okay, now something's
bothering me.

01:02.262 --> 01:08.969
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:08.969 --> 01:14.975
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:14.975 --> 01:18.679
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:18.679 --> 01:24.851
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

01:24.851 --> 01:28.055
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

01:28.055 --> 01:32.426
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

01:39.967 --> 01:42.569
How's the car coming?

01:43.704 --> 01:45.672
Is it supposed
to sound like that?

01:45.672 --> 01:46.506
SALEM:
No, it's
not supposed

01:46.506 --> 01:47.674
to sound like that.

01:47.674 --> 01:50.110
I'm afraid
the Zeldamobile is dead.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.678
It can't be.

01:51.678 --> 01:52.813
She was fine yesterday

01:52.813 --> 01:54.648
when I drove her
to the Piggly Wiggly.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.050
I'm telling you,
there's nothing more I can do.

01:57.050 --> 02:00.087
It's time to pull the plug
and buy a new car.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.755
Well,I can't do that.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.190
Hilda's not back from
her singles' cruise

02:03.190 --> 02:04.491
for another week, and...

02:04.491 --> 02:06.627
I've never bought a car
by myself before.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.895
There was a time
you'd never been blonde before

02:08.895 --> 02:11.098
but you gave that a shot.

02:13.166 --> 02:13.967
Hi.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.969
Notice anything
different about me?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.738
Not only is
your car dead

02:17.738 --> 02:20.273
but your niece
needs a smog check.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.442
You poor dear.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.211
I had no idea
you were so upset.

02:24.211 --> 02:26.580
Why does everyone keep assuming
I'm upset?

02:26.580 --> 02:28.382
I'm just a little damp.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.184
Sabrina, you have
a black cloud
over your head.

02:31.184 --> 02:32.853
That only happens when
a witch is in a funk

02:32.853 --> 02:34.421
and keeping it
all bottled up.

02:34.421 --> 02:36.923
We're a very literal species.

02:36.923 --> 02:39.359
Let's hope I never become
a bleeding-heart liberal.

02:39.359 --> 02:40.427
Is this about Kevin?

02:40.427 --> 02:41.261
No.

02:41.261 --> 02:41.995
School?

02:41.995 --> 02:43.363
School's fine.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.966
Kevin and I are ancient history
and that's totally okay.

02:45.966 --> 02:46.700
If you don't mind

02:46.700 --> 02:47.501
I'd like to
take a look

02:47.501 --> 02:49.703
and see what your
little cloud is made of.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.706
Hmm, that's funny.

02:52.706 --> 02:53.807
I'm seeing a lot
of sadness

02:53.807 --> 02:55.776
over your breakup
with Kevin--

02:55.776 --> 02:57.377
lingering feelings
for Harvey--

02:57.377 --> 02:59.346
conflicted emotions
about Josh--

02:59.346 --> 03:02.816
and you're clearly
overwhelmed with
schoolwork.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.518
Not even.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.721
Sometimes it
just feels like

03:07.721 --> 03:08.488
I'm being pulled

03:08.488 --> 03:10.257
in so many
different directions.

03:10.257 --> 03:11.892
You know, like everyone
expects me to be perfect

03:11.892 --> 03:12.959
all the time.

03:12.959 --> 03:16.063
Now, the only person
who expects you to be
perfect is you.

03:16.063 --> 03:19.132
We all love you
no matter what.

03:19.766 --> 03:20.934
Thank you, Aunt Zelda.

03:20.934 --> 03:21.902
And you see?

03:21.902 --> 03:23.103
Just by getting it
off your chest

03:23.103 --> 03:24.738
your little black
cloud is gone.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.039
But what if
it comes back?

03:26.039 --> 03:27.808
I don't want to be
depressed again.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.776
And the wet look
is totally dead.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.845
Well, Sabrina, the only way
to be sure

03:31.845 --> 03:35.749
that a black cloud won't return
is to get out of yourself.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.584
Do something that's
truly for others.

03:37.584 --> 03:38.518
Like what?

03:38.518 --> 03:40.554
Well,you could help me
shop for a used car.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.989
Oh, I don't want to set
my sights too high.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.191
Maybe I'll start
with bathing lepers

03:44.191 --> 03:45.992
and work my way up.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.862
Hey, did anybody
see this?

03:48.862 --> 03:50.997
I'm thinking of going to the big
protest rally this afternoon

03:50.997 --> 03:52.399
at the Mayflower Apartments.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.767
Ooh, yeah, I heard
about that.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.036
They want to tear down
that old historic building.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.938
and make way for
a new parking structure.

03:57.938 --> 03:58.939
I am so there.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.941
I've been to tons
of demonstrations

04:00.941 --> 04:02.075
and I don't mean
to get all braggy

04:02.075 --> 04:04.144
but I've actually
been arrested... twice.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.645
Once with Martin Sheen.

04:05.645 --> 04:06.780
Wow. A few more arrests

04:06.780 --> 04:08.715
and you'll be qualified
to be president.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.550
Well, you can definitely
count me in.

04:10.550 --> 04:11.818
-Really?!
-Really?!
-Really?!

04:11.818 --> 04:13.086
Absolutely.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.955
If there's one thing
this university needs

04:14.955 --> 04:16.123
is more parking.

04:16.123 --> 04:19.626
Morgan, the protest
is to save the building

04:19.626 --> 04:21.728
and stop
the parking
structure.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.029
Oh.

04:23.029 --> 04:24.431
Have a nice time.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.099
Josh and I are going
to stay here

04:26.099 --> 04:27.234
and snuggle on the couch.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.568
Actually, I'd like
to go to the rally.

04:28.568 --> 04:30.570
The Mayflower's
architecture's
pretty amazing.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.005
I'd love to get
some photographs

04:32.005 --> 04:33.974
before they
level the place.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.977
Crumbling bricks over
taut flesh.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.612
Good choice.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.982
Miles, how about you?

04:41.982 --> 04:44.451
Challenging authority,
public insurrection

04:44.451 --> 04:45.418
general mayhem?

04:45.418 --> 04:46.319
I'm all over it.

04:46.319 --> 04:49.256
Hey, this is our first
group act of civil disobedience.

04:49.256 --> 04:50.423
Whoo-hoo!

04:50.423 --> 04:51.424
Whoo-hoo?

04:51.424 --> 04:53.026
That'll go over
great at the protest.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.996
All we are saying is
give "Whoo-hoo" a chance.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.066
Salem?

05:00.066 --> 05:00.767
I did it.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.303
I found the perfect car
at the first dealer.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.805
It's blue.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.773
The leather is
practically new

05:06.773 --> 05:08.809
and it has the most
darling cup holders.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.544
Cup holders?

05:10.544 --> 05:12.946
What about the mileage?
The tread on the tires?

05:12.946 --> 05:15.182
Has the car ever been
in an accident?

05:15.182 --> 05:16.817
I didn't think to ask.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.351
But there's a lighted
makeup mirror

05:18.351 --> 05:21.021
on both visors.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.723
Never send a woman
to do a cat's job.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.026
( <i>with deep voice</i> ):
Hello.

05:26.026 --> 05:29.896
Yes, this is Mr. Spellman.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.598
My wife hasn't made up
her mind yet.

05:31.598 --> 05:32.599
What are you doing?

05:32.599 --> 05:34.701
I know she said
she liked the car

05:34.701 --> 05:35.802
but I can't let her
take it

05:35.802 --> 05:36.736
at that price.

05:36.736 --> 05:37.804
Salem, give me
that phone.

05:37.804 --> 05:38.839
Let's just say she's

05:38.839 --> 05:40.540
a lot more competent
in the boudoir

05:40.540 --> 05:42.809
than she is
under the hood.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.611
Hello, this is
Mrs. Spellman.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.379
I'm afraid I'll have
to call you back.

05:46.379 --> 05:49.015
I'm about
to become a widow.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.483
I told you
I can handle this.

05:50.483 --> 05:51.551
Oh, yeah?

05:51.551 --> 05:53.653
Then why did
Mr. let's-make-a-deal

05:53.653 --> 05:56.556
immediately give me
$500 off?

05:56.556 --> 05:58.058
What?!

05:58.058 --> 06:00.393
He said that price
was firm.

06:00.393 --> 06:01.394
What makes him think

06:01.394 --> 06:03.096
he can take
advantage of me?

06:03.096 --> 06:05.031
You're a rube?

06:05.031 --> 06:06.900
( <i>chanting</i> ):
Save the Mayflower.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.102
Save the Mayflower.
Save the Mayflower.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.770
Save the Mayflower.

06:10.770 --> 06:11.938
This is just
what I needed.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.039
I am totally
out of my funk.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.808
I haven't even thought
about my tragic breakup

06:14.808 --> 06:17.177
my grades, my lack
of direction...

06:17.177 --> 06:19.145
Okay, well, not as much
as I was before.

06:19.145 --> 06:20.580
Hey, save the Mayflower.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.349
This is so
morally gratifying.

06:22.349 --> 06:25.385
And I'm getting a fairly
decent upper body workout.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.487
It's a wonderful
thing you kids
are doing here.

06:27.487 --> 06:29.389
Have some lemonade.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.690
Oh, it's nothing,
you know.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.325
We're just holding up a few
signs

06:32.325 --> 06:33.693
raising a little
awareness.

06:33.693 --> 06:36.763
Listen, Lawman, before you
break out the K-9 units

06:36.763 --> 06:38.832
and water cannon,
may I remind you

06:38.832 --> 06:40.667
that the First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution

06:40.667 --> 06:43.203
clearly states that we have
a right for free assembly.

06:43.203 --> 06:43.603
Aw, geez.

06:43.603 --> 06:46.239
Rox, give it a rest,
would you?

06:46.239 --> 06:47.407
Officer Carmichael?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.108
Yeah.

06:48.108 --> 06:48.875
I didn't recognize you.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.210
You lose some weight?

06:50.210 --> 06:51.544
Yeah, yeah.
I'm on The Zone.

06:51.544 --> 06:54.080
You know, I missed you
at the No Nukes rally.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.049
I Had a Save
The Whales brunch.

06:56.883 --> 06:57.951
You know, these cornices

06:57.951 --> 06:59.152
are one
of the best examples

06:59.152 --> 07:01.054
of Romanesque revival
in the city.

07:01.054 --> 07:04.190
Yeah. We tried to
get them declared
a historical landmark

07:04.190 --> 07:05.458
but we didn't
make the cut.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.495
And now, we've got
30 days to pack up
and move out.

07:08.495 --> 07:09.496
That's terrible.

07:09.496 --> 07:10.497
Are a lot of young families

07:10.497 --> 07:12.132
going to be displaced
by the parking lot?

07:12.132 --> 07:14.067
Half the tenant
are families with kids.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.669
And the other half
are seniors.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.704
I've been living
here for 50 years.

07:17.704 --> 07:20.373
Married my husband
right there on this stoop.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.342
Divorced him in
the laundry room.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.611
I don't know how we're going
to find a place to live.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.212
So they're not just knocking
down a building--

07:26.212 --> 07:28.415
they're destroying
people's lives.

07:28.415 --> 07:29.816
Look, maybe it's not over yet.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.818
Maybe this protest
will really do some good.

07:31.818 --> 07:35.021
You're an optimistic
little firecracker,
aren't you?

07:35.021 --> 07:37.624
We'd hoped the protest would
attract some media attention.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.093
But so far, none of the
newspapers or TV stations

07:40.093 --> 07:42.395
have returned our calls.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.630
Hey, I'm the media.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.532
I could write a piece
for the Adams' paper

07:45.532 --> 07:46.700
then word would spread

07:46.700 --> 07:47.767
and people would learn
about your plight

07:47.767 --> 07:50.537
and the university wouldn't dare
throw you out in the street.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.105
Well, that's very sweet of you.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.274
Now get your little heinie
out of my flower bed.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.309
You're killing
my petunias.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.381
I had a feeling
you'd be back.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.650
That car's just
calling out your name.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.018
I know, I just
love....

08:05.018 --> 08:06.086
Meow.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.120
...cars.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.056
A subject I know
quite a lot about.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.124
I can see that.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.592
Well, like I told
your husband

08:12.592 --> 08:14.260
I can give it to you
for 11 thou.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.062
Well, that seems like
a very good price.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.263
Meow!

08:17.263 --> 08:20.433
Uh, if I hadn't noticed
the excessive wear on the tires

08:20.433 --> 08:23.269
and the shoddy repair work
to the fender.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.872
Why, I wouldn't give you a penny
over $9,000.

08:25.872 --> 08:28.174
You're a pretty tough
little negotiator.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.477
What say I throw in
some brand-new tires

08:30.477 --> 08:32.545
shave off a few bucks
for the fender

08:32.545 --> 08:35.648
and I give it to you
for $10,500.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.751
That seems like
a very reasonable compromise.

08:37.751 --> 08:38.785
Meow!

08:38.785 --> 08:39.619
Oh, hush up, kitty.

08:39.619 --> 08:40.387
Where do I sign?

08:40.387 --> 08:42.222
Ow!

08:42.222 --> 08:44.457
Would you excuse
me for a moment?

08:48.428 --> 08:49.062
What are you doing?!

08:49.062 --> 08:50.797
Can't you see?
He's ripping you off.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.465
He seems like a
perfectly honest man.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.234
Yeah, and I don't use
your toothbrush

08:54.234 --> 08:55.235
to clean my ears.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.603
That's disgusting.

08:56.603 --> 09:01.241
( <i>Salem sputtering</i> )

09:03.376 --> 09:06.246
I'm sorry, but I think
I'm going to do

09:06.246 --> 09:09.049
a little comparison shopping.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.384
I really love
your angle--

09:11.384 --> 09:12.852
"People Before Parking."

09:12.852 --> 09:13.853
It's inspired.

09:13.853 --> 09:15.522
Of course, no one
ever stands up

09:15.522 --> 09:16.923
for the people
who need parking.

09:16.923 --> 09:17.572
Hey.

09:17.572 --> 09:18.224
Hi.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.026
You don't think
it's too sentimental?

09:20.026 --> 09:21.161
Not at all.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.696
You know I got to say,I'm
really impressed.

09:23.696 --> 09:25.632
Most people our age
are too self-absorbed

09:25.632 --> 09:26.566
to get this involved.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.701
Not only do you care,
you put it in print.

09:28.701 --> 09:32.172
As much as I also care
about people I've never met

09:32.172 --> 09:34.474
we have a 7:30
dinner reservation.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.910
I wonder if this is why
Ralph Nader stayed single.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.312
One look at his suits
will tell you why.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.180
Come on.

09:40.180 --> 09:40.780
Okay, well, have fun

09:40.780 --> 09:42.782
and don't eat any
endangered species.

09:42.782 --> 09:46.252
Hey, let me know if
you need any help.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.221
I don't think I'm the one
that needs the help.

09:51.458 --> 09:54.027
♪ Blue days,
all of them gone ♪

09:54.027 --> 09:57.530
♪ Nothing but blue skies
from now on. ♪

09:57.530 --> 09:58.498
I think I liked
you better

09:58.498 --> 09:59.632
when you were depressed.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.067
Look, there's Dean Pitchford.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.203
He's the one in charge
of the demolition
of the Mayflower.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.705
Hi, Dean Pitchford.
I'm Sabrina Spellman.

10:05.705 --> 10:08.641
Oh, yes, our
resident instigator.

10:08.641 --> 10:10.009
Well, thanks
to your article

10:10.009 --> 10:11.644
I had a sleepless night
fielding phone calls

10:11.644 --> 10:13.513
from parents and trustees.

10:13.513 --> 10:15.215
Maybe you'd sleep better
if you did what was right

10:15.215 --> 10:17.283
and kept those tenants in
their homes.

10:18.051 --> 10:21.221
Or, you know, you could
just screen your calls.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.288
Well, thanks.

10:22.288 --> 10:22.755
But I won't have to worry

10:22.755 --> 10:24.757
about my phone ringing anymore.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.993
The Board of Trustees just had
an emergency meeting

10:26.993 --> 10:28.128
and resolved the problem.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.963
Well, that's great.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.764
Wait a minute.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.867
How exactly
did you resolve it?

10:35.969 --> 10:38.338
Hi, Mrs. Smiley,
I'm so glad you're here.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.205
I just saw the Dean

10:39.205 --> 10:41.107
and he said the Board
resolved the problem

10:41.107 --> 10:42.242
but he didn't say how.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.810
Well, apparently
your article

10:43.810 --> 10:45.345
really put a
fire under him.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.946
That's great.
You must be so happy.

10:46.946 --> 10:49.382
We don't have time
to be happy.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.619
Now they say we have
to packed up and out
of here by next week.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.899
Sabrina, stop beating
yourself up about this.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.033
Nobody's blaming you.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.301
Yeah, but if I hadn't
written that article...

11:08.301 --> 11:10.670
They were going to
be evicted anyway.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.239
Just not quite
this soon.

11:13.239 --> 11:16.676
Wow. Somebody sure has
a black cloud over her head.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.011
What? Oh, I can explain.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.380
Uh, it's just a weird
atmospheric convergence...

11:20.380 --> 11:22.215
There's no cloud over my head.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.785
No, it's something
we native English-speakers call

11:25.785 --> 11:28.021
"just an expression."

11:28.021 --> 11:29.756
Sabrina's upset
because they're
evicting

11:29.756 --> 11:31.057
everyone at
the Mayflower.

11:31.057 --> 11:32.892
That's awful!

11:32.892 --> 11:36.062
And you worked so hard
on your little article.

11:36.763 --> 11:38.898
I think that somebody
needs to treat herself

11:38.898 --> 11:40.767
to a new pair of shoes.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.536
Seriously.

11:43.903 --> 11:45.471
How could the dean
and the board of trustees

11:45.471 --> 11:48.107
hear about those people
and still be so cold-hearted?

11:48.107 --> 11:49.509
Most people don't
react to things

11:49.509 --> 11:50.743
like you and
I do, Sabrina.

11:50.743 --> 11:52.779
That's because,
to the normal world,

11:52.779 --> 11:55.215
these people are just
faceless strangers.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.650
Well, maybe if they saw
the faces of those tenants

11:57.650 --> 11:59.118
they wouldn't be
so apathetic.

11:59.118 --> 12:00.753
Faces...

12:00.753 --> 12:03.790
Of course. You just gave
me an idea, Spellman.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.091
How's this?

12:16.703 --> 12:18.071
Hot off the laser printer.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.138
I also took the liberty

12:19.138 --> 12:21.507
of airbrushing
Mrs. Smiley's mole.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.610
Oh, these photos are perfect.

12:23.610 --> 12:24.978
When people see these faces,
they're going to know

12:24.978 --> 12:26.913
how important this cause is.

12:26.913 --> 12:27.914
Yeah, I'm still here.

12:27.914 --> 12:28.982
Great! All right!

12:28.982 --> 12:30.950
We'll see you tomorrow
at 3:00.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.987
All right, Channel Six is coming
to our protest. Woo-hoo!

12:33.987 --> 12:35.421
No way!
That's fantastic!

12:35.421 --> 12:37.490
I'm sorry,
am I missing something?

12:37.490 --> 12:38.925
Oh, great news.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.060
Tomorrow, we are holding
the biggest demonstration

12:41.060 --> 12:42.495
that has ever been held
at Adams College

12:42.495 --> 12:44.163
and three news crews are coming.

12:44.163 --> 12:45.999
And a reporter from
the <i>Boston Globe.</i>

12:45.999 --> 12:48.234
A dozen posters,
ready to go.

12:48.234 --> 12:48.668
Ooh.

12:48.668 --> 12:49.969
The guy at Kinko's
was so moved

12:49.969 --> 12:52.572
he gave me free
collating for the
rest of my life.

12:52.572 --> 12:53.573
Wow, these are perfect.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.208
Okay, we still got a ton of
things to organize.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.976
We got to plaster these up
all over campus.

12:56.976 --> 12:58.478
Well, I can be
in charge of that.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.746
You want to
help me, honey?

12:59.746 --> 13:01.514
Josh, I hate to drop
a reality bomb

13:01.514 --> 13:03.249
on this little
do-gooder convention

13:03.249 --> 13:04.984
but we have plans tonight.

13:05.885 --> 13:09.055
We're going to the opening
of that new club, the Trocadero.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.758
Oh, man,
I totally forgot.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.826
Maybe you could plaster one
of these up while you're there.

13:13.826 --> 13:16.796
Oh, no can do.
The only place Josh's
hands are going to be

13:16.796 --> 13:18.264
are on me.

13:18.264 --> 13:20.867
I'm sorry, I'm going
to have to cancel.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.368
What?!

13:22.368 --> 13:23.569
I-I bought a new dress

13:23.569 --> 13:24.904
I told everybody
that we're coming

13:24.904 --> 13:26.839
and I pulled major strings
to get us in.

13:26.839 --> 13:29.609
Morgan, these people are
about to lose their homes.

13:29.609 --> 13:30.943
I think that's a
little more important

13:30.943 --> 13:33.446
than seeing you and
your friends dressed
in Saran Wrap...

13:33.446 --> 13:35.448
yet again.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.749
Do you really wear Saran Wrap?

13:36.749 --> 13:37.884
It's pleather.

13:37.884 --> 13:40.486
Josh, you can't
just dismiss me.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.922
We promised each other
that if we had a disagreement

13:42.922 --> 13:44.724
we would at least
discuss it.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.427
Well, your idea of
discussing it means
I change my mind.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.229
And it's been working
so well for us.

13:50.229 --> 13:51.631
Well, it's not
working this time.

13:51.631 --> 13:52.665
I'm going with Sabrina.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.267
Of course you are.

13:54.267 --> 13:57.170
Sabrina says jump
and suddenly you're
slapping flyers

13:57.170 --> 14:01.007
all over a school
you don't even go to.

14:01.007 --> 14:01.641
So...

14:01.641 --> 14:02.675
on a scale
from one to ten

14:02.675 --> 14:04.677
how uncomfortable do
you feel right now?

14:04.677 --> 14:07.113
Very comfortable.
Feels just like home.

14:07.113 --> 14:09.182
You know, I understand
if you want to be with Morgan.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.983
No, no, I want
to be with you.

14:10.983 --> 14:14.487
I mean, here, working
on this, with you.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.359
I have had it.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.893
I have been to every
used car lot

14:20.893 --> 14:22.362
on the eastern seaboard.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.698
One more toupee-wearing,
polyester-clad salesman

14:25.698 --> 14:27.300
calls me "little lady..."

14:27.300 --> 14:30.002
You're worries are over,
little lad-ya.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.371
I've come across
a couple of beauties

14:31.371 --> 14:32.939
that I think
will be perfect for you.

14:32.939 --> 14:34.974
A '72 Oldsmobile?!

14:34.974 --> 14:37.076
Salem, that thing's
a land yacht.

14:37.076 --> 14:39.912
Well, as you fade
into your golden years

14:39.912 --> 14:42.048
you may find yourself
spreading a little

14:42.048 --> 14:43.883
and you'll want
a nice bench seat.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.318
This is ridiculous!

14:45.318 --> 14:48.388
I am going to get that little
blue car we saw yesterday.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.523
Fine. Get the car.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.392
But since I'm the one
maintaining it

14:52.392 --> 14:54.293
at least let me
look under the hood.

14:54.293 --> 14:55.294
All right.

14:55.294 --> 14:56.863
But for goodness sake,
this time

14:56.863 --> 14:59.632
could you try to be
a little more discreet?

15:02.668 --> 15:03.836
How does it look?

15:03.836 --> 15:05.104
Water pump's new

15:05.104 --> 15:07.306
but it looks like
the cylinder head
might be loose.

15:07.306 --> 15:08.674
I wish I had a wrench!

15:08.674 --> 15:09.809
Well, little lady

15:09.809 --> 15:11.744
have I got good news
for you.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.912
I talked to my manager

15:12.912 --> 15:15.148
he has agreed
to your $9,000 offer.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.450
Well, that's wonderful.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.185
Let's go sign the papers.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.154
I'll be there
in just a sec.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.156
Salem, he's going to meet
our price.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.191
Oh! I'm stuck!

15:25.191 --> 15:26.626
Oh, is there
a problem?

15:26.626 --> 15:30.530
Um, no, it's just...
that... well...

15:30.530 --> 15:32.465
my cat is stuck.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.699
I can see that.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.635
But don't you worry,
we'll take him out of there.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.270
And if anything
goes wrong

15:37.270 --> 15:38.938
then we'll just
get you a new cat

15:38.938 --> 15:40.973
any color you'd like.

15:40.973 --> 15:46.446
PROTESTERS ( <i>chanting):</i>
People before parking!
People before parking!

15:46.446 --> 15:48.047
Spellman, you rock.

15:48.047 --> 15:49.115
This is so much better

15:49.115 --> 15:50.783
than the genetically-
engineered corn rally

15:50.783 --> 15:52.051
I can't even tell you.

15:52.051 --> 15:53.920
Thanks. Coming from you,
that's quite a compliment.

15:53.920 --> 15:54.987
What's with the new jewelry?

15:54.987 --> 15:56.155
It's not really
a protest

15:56.155 --> 15:57.857
unless I chain
myself to something.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.492
We all have our
little traditions.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.694
Hey, Miles,
have you seen Josh?

16:01.694 --> 16:02.995
He's supposed to be
corraling the news crews.

16:02.995 --> 16:03.796
No, I haven't.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.032
But I have made an
amazing discovery.

16:06.032 --> 16:09.869
Chicks dig social
revolutionaries.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.737
Down with The Man!

16:13.873 --> 16:15.975
Hey, Sabrina,
we've got problems.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.477
Josh, what's the matter?
Where are the news crews?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.145
They're all covering
a breaking story.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.481
Apparently it's the biggest
thing since Baby Jessica.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.216
Paramedics are standing by

16:23.216 --> 16:26.752
as firefighters work tirelessly
to free the terrified feline.

16:26.752 --> 16:29.188
We'll keep you updated as
this tragic situation unfolds.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.123
Meanwhile, let's see
if we can get a comment

16:31.123 --> 16:33.125
from the grief-stricken owner.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.362
Oh, really, he's fine.

16:36.362 --> 16:40.700
So you're saying you
could just throw me
over your shoulder?

16:40.700 --> 16:41.868
Gotta go. Here.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.540
ZELDA:
Well, he's truly like
a member of the family.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.774
REPORTER:
Sure.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.510
Hey, Aunt Zelda.
What are you doing?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.245
You're totally
Bogarting my coverage.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.280
Well, I'm sorry,
but I can't use my magic

16:54.280 --> 16:55.815
with all these people
watching.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.350
I have an idea-- Do you
think you can keep

16:57.350 --> 16:58.851
everyone's attention
on you for a minute?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.587
Well, that shouldn't
be a problem.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.560
Salem, you're ruining
my protest.

17:07.560 --> 17:11.531
Yeah? Like I planned on waving
my butt on national television!

17:11.531 --> 17:12.932
Can't you just suck it in
a little?

17:12.932 --> 17:14.300
I am!

17:14.300 --> 17:16.202
I got to cut back
on the nachos.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.638
On the plus side,
I am now a celebrity.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.573
No, your butt's a celebrity.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.041
Not the first time.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.409
We'll have to get
the Jaws of Life!

17:23.409 --> 17:25.044
It'll take a couple hours!
( <i>gasping</i> )

17:25.044 --> 17:27.980
I don't have a couple of hours.

17:28.247 --> 17:29.248
( <i>screaming</i> )

17:29.248 --> 17:31.183
Is he all right?
Are there any
missing limbs?

17:31.183 --> 17:33.452
Oh, he's fine.
No harm done...

17:33.452 --> 17:34.921
until we get home.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.088
Cut.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.590
Let's pack it in.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.059
Hey, did you know the
students are storming

17:40.059 --> 17:41.761
the administration
building over at Adams?

17:41.761 --> 17:44.397
Well, it's not a cat stuck
in an engine block, but...

17:44.397 --> 17:46.966
it's better than nothing--
Let's go; let's roll.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.568
So shall we go
sign the papers?

17:48.568 --> 17:49.569
Absolutely.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.070
But there's one
slight problem.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.273
Your cat seems to have
done some damage while
he was stuck in there.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.842
I would say...
$2,000 worth?

17:56.842 --> 17:59.879
So we're back to the
original asking price.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.448
Right you are,
little lady.

18:02.448 --> 18:05.718
Well, in that case,
I'd like to trade
in my cat.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.654
Do you have a '97 calico
with low mileage?

18:08.654 --> 18:10.389
We're reporting live
from Adams College

18:10.389 --> 18:11.624
where administrators
are planning on

18:11.624 --> 18:14.160
turning 50 residents
of the Mayflower Apartments

18:14.160 --> 18:16.729
out onto the cold streets
of Boston.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.831
Excuse me!
May I have your attention?

18:18.831 --> 18:20.333
PROTESTERS:
People before parking!

18:20.333 --> 18:22.134
Please! May I please
have your attention?

18:22.134 --> 18:24.470
Quiet down.
Let the man speak.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.138
After careful consideration

18:26.138 --> 18:28.140
of the plight
of the Mayflower residents

18:28.140 --> 18:30.810
which was, fortunately,
brought to our attention...

18:31.944 --> 18:34.747
Adams College is prepared
to compensate the tenants

18:34.747 --> 18:37.049
by providing housing
in the Candor Arms

18:37.049 --> 18:41.287
a new residential community
on the other side of the campus.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.722
You call that compensation?

18:42.722 --> 18:43.956
How can you insult
these people

18:43.956 --> 18:45.925
by asking them to move
from their beloved homes

18:45.925 --> 18:47.360
into pre-fab
cardboard boxes?

18:47.360 --> 18:48.894
PROTESTERS:
Yeah!

18:48.894 --> 18:50.596
Do these pre-fab cardboard boxes

18:50.596 --> 18:53.299
have washers and dryers
in each unit?

18:53.299 --> 18:53.966
You bet.

18:53.966 --> 18:54.867
And dishwashers?

18:54.867 --> 18:55.635
Yes, sir.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.269
How are appliances
supposed to compare

18:57.269 --> 18:58.738
to a lifetime of memories?

18:58.738 --> 19:00.806
Compared to my memories,
they win hands down.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.375
When do we move?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.176
Ah, that's the spirit!

19:09.148 --> 19:10.683
( <i>paper ripping</i> )

19:12.251 --> 19:14.820
Aw, what's the matter?
Post-protest blues?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.522
I guess.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.391
You know the university
is still going to tear
down that building.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.092
I just feel like
we settled.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.094
Sabrina, this wasn't
about a building,

19:22.094 --> 19:24.730
it was about people--
you said so yourself.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.065
And they're happy.

19:26.065 --> 19:28.034
I don't think they feel like
they're settling.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.335
You did a good thing.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.436
You really think so?

19:30.436 --> 19:32.438
Yeah, I do.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.374
You're pretty amazing.

19:35.374 --> 19:35.941
Sabrina...

19:35.941 --> 19:38.477
Sabrina, I just want to tell you
how wonderful this all is.

19:38.477 --> 19:40.913
Thanks to you and your
boyfriend, I got a new home.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.214
Oh, well, I'm glad
it all worked out.

19:42.214 --> 19:45.184
And he's not my boyfriend.
He already has a girlfriend.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.820
Well, actually,
not anymore.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.555
Morgan and I broke up
this morning.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.223
What? Really?

19:51.223 --> 19:52.425
Oh, Josh, I'm so sorry.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.326
No, she's not.

19:54.326 --> 19:55.761
( <i>nervous chuckle</i> )

20:01.867 --> 20:03.602
It's really over this time.

20:03.602 --> 20:05.204
He had his mind made up.

20:05.204 --> 20:09.542
Nothing that I could say or wear
was gonna change it.

20:09.775 --> 20:10.976
I'm sorry, Morgan.

20:10.976 --> 20:12.745
I know how much
you cared about him.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.180
I did.

20:14.180 --> 20:19.285
But in the end, I guess I was
just too much woman for him.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.119
You know, I really think

20:20.119 --> 20:23.389
that he would rather be
with someone like you.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.924
Really? Did he...
did he say that?

20:24.924 --> 20:27.359
I mean, did he actually
mention me by name?

20:27.359 --> 20:30.796
I didn't say <i>you,</i>
I said someone <i>like</i> you.

20:30.796 --> 20:32.798
Oh. Right.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.200
Oh, I just...

20:34.200 --> 20:36.569
I don't know what I'm
going to do, Sabrina.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.671
I just feel
so depressed.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.107
All I could say is,
you got to get out of yourself.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.775
You know, you got to focus
all your energies

20:42.775 --> 20:45.111
on something positive.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.346
Yeah, that's excellent advice

20:47.346 --> 20:53.419
but I think I'll just stay with
my own tried and true method.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.421
Hi, Dave!
I'm all ready.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.790
Bye.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.191
Now why didn't I think of that?
