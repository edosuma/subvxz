01:47.233 --> 01:49.266
- In the beginning
was the Word.

01:49.333 --> 01:52.600
And the Word was with God
and the Word was God.

01:52.667 --> 01:55.166
So, from the starting gun,
it's all about the Word.

01:55.233 --> 01:56.934
All about communication.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.033
Couple million millennia go by,
along comes man.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.867
God wants somebody
to chat with.

02:01.934 --> 02:05.300
Turns out man wants
more than that.

02:05.367 --> 02:08.400
Man wants the gossip page
and phone sex,

02:08.467 --> 02:11.500
re-runs of "Seinfeld,"
and auctions in cyberspace.

02:11.567 --> 02:15.066
Man's got his own plan
as far as communication goes

02:15.133 --> 02:17.433
and the inventions
to see it through.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.467
And poor God.

02:19.533 --> 02:21.800
- He's still got no one
to talk to.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.467
- Thanks for getting here
so quick.

02:32.533 --> 02:34.667
- So, uh, tell me,
what happened?

02:34.734 --> 02:36.500
- About an hour ago,

02:36.567 --> 02:39.066
a man posing
as a newspaper reporter...

02:39.133 --> 02:41.200
- Entered the visiting room
to see Kareem Said.

02:41.266 --> 02:42.467
- He pulled out a gun...

02:42.533 --> 02:43.700
- Shot Said dead.

02:45.767 --> 02:47.934
- Oh, my God.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.133
- Get the fuck
out of here, man!

03:03.734 --> 03:09.233
- Your press pass says that
your name is Lemuel Idzik.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.567
Is that, in fact,
your real name?

03:11.633 --> 03:14.166
- Who could make up a name
like that?

03:14.233 --> 03:16.000
Yes.

03:16.066 --> 03:18.166
Idzik.

03:18.233 --> 03:21.300
- I'm Detective McGorry,
homicide.

03:21.367 --> 03:24.233
I need to ask you
some questions.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.500
- I did it.

03:26.567 --> 03:28.600
I killed Kareem Said.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.266
What more is there?

03:30.333 --> 03:32.400
- You'd be willing
to sign a confession?

03:32.467 --> 03:34.233
- Yes.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.934
You write out the words
and I'll sign it

03:38.000 --> 03:41.667
in  my best penmanship.

03:41.734 --> 03:42.867
- After I've read you
your rights,

03:42.934 --> 03:44.934
I'll want you to tell me
what happened.

03:47.433 --> 03:49.000
- Here's all I'll say.

03:50.834 --> 03:54.333
I had to kill him...

03:54.400 --> 03:57.934
before...
nightfall.

04:03.500 --> 04:07.066
- Leo, we just got an inquiry
from a local TV station

04:07.133 --> 04:09.100
wanting verification
of Said's death.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.834
- Shit!
How'd the word get out so fast?

04:11.900 --> 04:14.934
- I guess the Muslims
must have contacted them.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.266
- Well, don't call
the station back just yet.

04:17.333 --> 04:18.734
- They said they're
sending over a news truck.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.166
- Well, don't let them
on the grounds.

04:20.233 --> 04:22.033
Have them park in that empty lot
across Monroe Boulevard.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.433
- Well, that was
relatively easy.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.533
- Did Idzik say
why he killed Said?

04:31.600 --> 04:32.533
- No.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.166
No, he just kept talking

04:34.233 --> 04:36.767
about nightfall,
whatever the hell that means.

04:36.834 --> 04:38.734
I'm gonna
take him downtown.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.500
- And I'm gonna find out
how the fuck a man with a gun

04:41.567 --> 04:43.700
could get into Oz.

04:48.066 --> 04:52.166
According to the log book,
you signed Lemuel Idzik in.

04:52.233 --> 04:54.266
- Seems so, sir.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.633
- And you checked him thoroughly
for weapons?

04:56.700 --> 04:58.200
- He went through
the metal detector,

04:58.266 --> 04:59.800
same as everyone else.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.300
- And the machine
didn't go off?

05:01.367 --> 05:03.467
- No, sir.
Would've noticed it.

05:03.533 --> 05:06.533
- Brese, I've had
to discipline you twice

05:06.600 --> 05:08.166
for drinking on duty.

05:08.233 --> 05:10.066
I can smell the alcohol
on your breath.

05:10.133 --> 05:13.066
- My wife's got cancer--
- Look, I don't care!

05:13.133 --> 05:15.633
You have a job, man,
a responsibility,

05:15.700 --> 05:17.533
and you failed.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.033
As a result,
a man is dead.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.600
- A prisoner.

05:22.667 --> 05:26.467
Here's what I want you to do.

05:26.533 --> 05:28.333
Change out of your uniform,

05:28.400 --> 05:31.834
and then get the fuck
out of my prison!

05:34.133 --> 05:36.900
- The way things are going,
it won't be yours much longer.

05:44.066 --> 05:47.000
- Jesus Christ,
what the fuck's going on?

05:47.066 --> 05:51.033
Mayor Loewen, Harrison Beecher,
Schibetta, Kirk,

05:51.100 --> 05:54.166
now Kareem Said, all murdered
in a matter of weeks.

05:54.233 --> 05:55.333
- There doesn't seem
to be a link

05:55.400 --> 05:56.900
between any of these deaths.

05:56.967 --> 05:59.200
- Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

05:59.266 --> 06:01.133
- Do you have any suspects
for the Wilson Loewen case?

06:01.200 --> 06:02.834
- There were 11 men
on the ward that night.

06:02.900 --> 06:05.000
All of them are suspects.

06:05.066 --> 06:07.700
The difficulty is
narrowing the list.

06:07.767 --> 06:11.567
- Look, just pick someone,
any of these scumbags.

06:11.633 --> 06:14.767
- Governor, you're not actually
suggesting that I do that.

06:14.834 --> 06:19.600
- I'm suggesting that you do
your job, McGorry, and fast,

06:19.667 --> 06:21.133
before I tell
the police commissioner

06:21.200 --> 06:24.400
to put another Sherlock
in charge.

06:31.867 --> 06:34.633
- So, Detective,
now what?

06:34.700 --> 06:36.467
- Beats me.

06:36.533 --> 06:40.867
Easy answer is that a black man
murdered Loewen...

06:40.934 --> 06:42.567
only my gut tells me
that's not what happened.

06:42.633 --> 06:44.100
This isn't about prejudice.

06:44.166 --> 06:46.834
This?
This is personal.

06:46.900 --> 06:49.967
Somebody hired somebody
to kill Loewen.

06:50.033 --> 06:54.033
- Yeah, but who?
And why?

06:59.133 --> 07:01.567
- The printing press
changed the world forever,

07:01.633 --> 07:02.967
and for the better.

07:03.033 --> 07:07.467
Bibles got printed in vernacular
rather than Latin,

07:07.533 --> 07:09.467
bringing God out
of the Dark Ages,

07:09.533 --> 07:11.300
out of dark corners,

07:11.367 --> 07:15.767
to ordinary folks
like you and me.

07:15.834 --> 07:19.233
But imagine old Gutenberg
at a newsstand today.

07:19.300 --> 07:23.233
Think he'd be proud
of paving the way for "Juggs,"

07:23.300 --> 07:26.734
"High Times,"
and "Soldier of Fortune"?

07:30.467 --> 07:33.667
- Ah!
Well, look who's back.

07:33.734 --> 07:35.000
- What's with
the news trucks outside?

07:35.066 --> 07:37.567
- Oh, you know.
Same old nonsense.

07:37.633 --> 07:39.166
Metal objects.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.100
Step through.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.633
Who you here to see?

07:48.700 --> 07:50.033
- My client, Chris Keller.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.367
- Client?

07:51.433 --> 07:53.800
Is that what they're
calling it now?

07:53.867 --> 07:57.066
Are you carrying any alcohol,
drugs, weapons, or explosives?

07:57.133 --> 07:59.567
- No.
- Very good, sign here.

07:59.633 --> 08:03.033
Social security number there,
favorite color there.

08:04.166 --> 08:06.100
A little humor
breaks up the day.

08:25.233 --> 08:27.200
You going in or not, Beecher?

08:38.367 --> 08:40.633
- Tobias?
- Hey.

08:40.700 --> 08:46.300
- Tobias, I have--
I have terrible news.

08:46.367 --> 08:48.233
Kareem Said is dead.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.900
- What?

08:58.467 --> 09:00.467
- Bryce Tibbets' murder case?

09:02.367 --> 09:04.333
A witness has come forward.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.200
Imagine that.

09:06.266 --> 09:07.800
- So, we're gonna file
the motion today

09:07.867 --> 09:09.066
to have your death sentence
overturned.

09:09.133 --> 09:11.834
- Toby, you really think
there's a chance,

09:11.900 --> 09:15.500
I mean,
with this eyewitness?

09:15.567 --> 09:17.600
- Well, you see,
he's the key.

09:17.667 --> 09:20.800
I kept wondering why
Jerry Heekin waited four years

09:20.867 --> 09:23.033
to contact the authorities,

09:23.100 --> 09:24.700
and then the law firm
did some digging--

09:24.767 --> 09:26.000
- Heekin was caught
dealing crack.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.367
Yeah, your dad told me.
- Last year.

09:28.433 --> 09:29.834
And he was arrested
for the third time.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.533
Three strikes, right?

09:31.600 --> 09:33.767
So, hoping for a deal
he goes to the FBI,

09:33.834 --> 09:36.100
says he saw you dump
Bryce Tibbets' body.

09:36.166 --> 09:40.133
Now whether he did or not
is immaterial

09:40.200 --> 09:42.533
because I think your pal,
Agent Taylor,

09:42.600 --> 09:45.100
helped him fill in
most of the details.

09:46.300 --> 09:51.500
In Heekin's initial conversation
with the FBI...

09:51.567 --> 09:53.467
he doesn't say anything
about the flashlight.

09:53.533 --> 09:55.600
Only afterwards,
to the D.A.,

09:55.667 --> 09:57.533
does he add the flashlight
to the story,

09:57.600 --> 10:00.200
which is bullshit, right?

10:00.266 --> 10:02.934
Because you would've
noticed somebody

10:03.000 --> 10:04.233
shining a flashlight on you,

10:04.300 --> 10:05.767
especially if you're dumping
a dead body.

10:05.834 --> 10:09.433
- Christ almighty, this is what
I kept saying to McClain.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.700
- Well, the bottom line is,

10:11.767 --> 10:15.300
he can cut a deal with the D.A.
pending your conviction,

10:15.367 --> 10:17.033
and because of that we can imply

10:17.100 --> 10:18.667
that Heekin made up
the whole story

10:18.734 --> 10:21.200
or was given the account
by Agent Taylor.

10:21.266 --> 10:25.734
Unreliable witness testimony
plus prosecutorial misconduct

10:25.800 --> 10:27.767
equals an overturned verdict.

10:30.633 --> 10:34.266
- That's beautiful.

10:34.333 --> 10:37.467
- Can you girls
keep the giggling down?

10:37.533 --> 10:40.100
- Yeah, I'd better
get over the courthouse.

10:40.166 --> 10:42.233
- Hey, all we've been doing
is talking about legal shit.

10:42.300 --> 10:45.867
But how you doing...

10:45.934 --> 10:48.133
with your father gone
and now Said?

10:52.033 --> 10:55.066
Hey, it's okay.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.300
I'm sorry.

10:59.934 --> 11:02.533
Tell me,
what's it like...

11:02.600 --> 11:04.300
being free?

11:04.367 --> 11:08.433
- Uh, it's, uh...

11:10.600 --> 11:14.333
The zoo,
the soccer field.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.834
We're outdoors constantly,
you know?

11:17.900 --> 11:20.166
Spending time with my kids,
real time.

11:21.767 --> 11:22.900
- It's little things,
you know,

11:22.967 --> 11:26.667
like helping them
with their homework,

11:26.734 --> 11:30.033
going to PTSA meetings.

11:30.100 --> 11:33.600
Holly's teacher is this
really funny, smart woman.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.633
You'd love her.
She's, uh...

11:37.300 --> 11:39.200
She makes me laugh out loud.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.567
- I'm happy for you, Toby.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.200
I'm happy for you.

11:48.266 --> 11:49.467
- Hey, what'd I tell you two?

11:49.533 --> 11:52.033
No smooching!

11:52.100 --> 11:53.900
- Time to go.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.166
Get me out of here.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.700
Get me the fuck away
from Lopresti.

12:15.867 --> 12:17.900
- Thank you, officer.

12:17.967 --> 12:20.066
Good morning.
- Hello, gorgeous.

12:20.133 --> 12:22.867
- Ah, we're in that kind
of mood, huh?

12:22.934 --> 12:26.867
All right, uh,
under a new state law,

12:26.934 --> 12:30.600
every six months I have
to review the mental health

12:30.667 --> 12:33.300
of every resident of death row,
and it's your turn.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.600
So, how's your mental health?

12:37.667 --> 12:39.000
- Well, Beecher seems
to think

12:39.066 --> 12:41.333
my days on death row
are numbered.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.500
- Yeah, I know,
I saw him earlier.

12:44.567 --> 12:46.333
- How'd he seem to you?

12:48.100 --> 12:49.767
- Well, he's obviously
grieving for the loss

12:49.834 --> 12:51.834
of his father and Said.

12:51.900 --> 12:55.000
- Yeah, I mean,
other than that.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.467
- What are you
asking me exactly?

13:05.934 --> 13:08.233
- Beecher's in love.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.834
- Really?

13:09.900 --> 13:11.233
Did he say so?

13:11.300 --> 13:13.667
- I can tell.

13:13.734 --> 13:17.000
- And, uh, how does that
make you feel?

13:17.066 --> 13:18.567
- Oh, I don't know.

13:18.633 --> 13:20.934
- Come on, Chris,
don't bull me.

13:21.033 --> 13:24.000
How does that make you feel?

13:24.066 --> 13:25.767
- Happy!

13:25.834 --> 13:28.667
- For him?
- Yes.

13:28.734 --> 13:32.467
- And for you?
- Jealous.

13:32.533 --> 13:35.500
- And what are you gonna do
with that jealousy?

13:35.567 --> 13:37.667
Chew on it?
Suck on it?

13:37.734 --> 13:38.667
Devour it whole?

13:38.734 --> 13:41.300
- Yeah!
Okay?

13:41.367 --> 13:44.100
Beecher has what I want!
I want a life!

13:48.166 --> 13:51.333
I get executed and he lives
a long, old life,

13:51.400 --> 13:54.233
surrounded by
his grandchildren.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.700
I want a life!

14:04.800 --> 14:08.266
You can't expect me not
to be a little envious.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.500
- Sure, I can.

14:10.567 --> 14:14.567
If you truly love him,
I expect that and more.

14:19.867 --> 14:22.800
I'll write in my review
that you're behaving normally.

14:38.767 --> 14:41.800
- Mail call.

14:41.867 --> 14:45.400
- Hey, Vern,
heard about your pal Loewen.

14:45.467 --> 14:48.266
- A tragedy,
a fuckin' tragedy.

14:49.734 --> 14:52.600
- Well, well, well,
look at this.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.600
The three of us
together again.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.367
I'm all misty.

14:56.433 --> 14:57.834
Hey, Vern, wait a minute.

14:57.900 --> 15:00.400
I want you to hear something.
You, too, Lopresti.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.900
"Upon considering the body
of relevant precedence

15:02.967 --> 15:06.633
"in general and in holdings
of the court, blah, blah, blah,

15:06.700 --> 15:08.500
"I am compelled to conclude

15:08.567 --> 15:11.000
that the petitioner's claim
is meritorious."

15:11.066 --> 15:12.767
- Meaning?
- You're out of here.

15:14.066 --> 15:15.467
- No shit?
- No shit.

15:15.533 --> 15:18.700
- Woo-hoo!
Yeah!

15:20.100 --> 15:21.300
- Toby.

15:22.633 --> 15:25.934
I owe you my life.
I owe you my life.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.767
I owe you my life.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.700
- Winthrop.

15:56.066 --> 15:58.467
- You're Keller, right?
- Mm-hmm.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.166
- I heard plenty of stories
about you.

16:00.233 --> 16:02.000
- Yeah?

16:02.066 --> 16:04.333
I've heard a couple
about you myself.

16:04.400 --> 16:07.934
There's one in particular
that interests me.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.800
- I interest you?

16:10.867 --> 16:14.166
- Fascinate is a better word.

16:14.233 --> 16:19.000
Meet me later,
storage closet, Unit B.

16:19.066 --> 16:20.433
- Okay.

16:36.934 --> 16:39.734
Nice.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.533
I thought you only had eyes
for Beecher.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.600
- Beecher's the one who brought
you and me together.

16:44.667 --> 16:46.500
- What do you mean?
- That story I heard,

16:46.567 --> 16:49.266
the one that fascinates me?

16:49.333 --> 16:51.300
- Yeah?

16:51.367 --> 16:53.100
- That's the one where
you killed Beecher's father.

16:53.166 --> 16:55.767
- No! No! No!

17:09.633 --> 17:11.066
- Hey, Keller.

17:11.133 --> 17:14.667
How's it feel to be back
in the gen pop?

17:14.734 --> 17:16.367
- Sweet.

17:19.567 --> 17:22.400
- One day in 1876,

17:22.467 --> 17:26.233
Alexander Graham Bell
uttered through a wire,

17:26.300 --> 17:29.200
"Watson, come here,
I want you."

17:29.266 --> 17:32.500
130 years later, we're talking
through satellites.

17:32.567 --> 17:35.000
Strange, huh,
that before hanging up,

17:35.066 --> 17:37.400
we say, "Keep in touch,"

17:37.467 --> 17:39.734
when there's never
any touch involved,

17:39.800 --> 17:41.300
no contact?

17:41.367 --> 17:43.734
Just cables and frequencies.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.600
Still...

17:46.667 --> 17:50.767
to get an "I love you" call
in the middle of a shitty day,

17:50.834 --> 17:54.300
that makes a cell phone
seem miraculous.

17:54.367 --> 17:56.533
- By and large,
things are off to a good start.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.667
A few glitches,
but nothing I didn't factor in.

17:59.734 --> 18:01.467
- I confess,
I'm the type who hangs up

18:01.533 --> 18:04.200
as soon as I smell
a solicitation.

18:04.266 --> 18:05.967
What percentage of these calls
actually get people

18:06.033 --> 18:08.400
to donate
to Senator Laken's campaign?

18:08.467 --> 18:11.934
- Believe it or not, you only
need a 1% to 2% success rate

18:12.000 --> 18:13.700
for telemarketing
to be effective.

18:13.767 --> 18:15.800
- 2%?
- I like to do better.

18:15.867 --> 18:19.000
My numbers are hovering
in the 5% to 6% range.

18:19.066 --> 18:22.033
Your men are proving
to be very effective.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.667
- Mrs. Howard?
- Yes.

18:23.734 --> 18:25.633
- Good afternoon.
I'm calling on behalf

18:25.700 --> 18:27.734
of the campaign
to re-elect Archibald Laken

18:27.800 --> 18:29.834
to the United States Senate.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.200
May I have a moment
of your time?

18:31.266 --> 18:33.300
- Sure.
- Thank you.

18:33.367 --> 18:34.800
- Mr. Erickson,
good afternoon.

18:34.867 --> 18:36.834
I'm calling on behalf of--

18:38.700 --> 18:40.233
Mrs. Sharif?
Good afternoon.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.500
- Persevere,
Kenaniah, persevere.

18:49.467 --> 18:51.567
- Senator Laken's record
has been outstanding,

18:51.633 --> 18:53.834
especially in regard
to education,

18:53.900 --> 18:57.033
national security,
and anti-crime measures.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.133
- How are the others
holding up?

19:02.300 --> 19:06.900
- We're sad...
demoralized.

19:06.967 --> 19:09.633
You know...

19:09.700 --> 19:12.600
Kareem had made plans for us
to start a book-binding business

19:12.667 --> 19:17.166
and the preparations
are in motion.

19:17.233 --> 19:18.667
- And the first book
was supposed to be

19:18.734 --> 19:21.800
Augustus Hill's memoir?

19:21.867 --> 19:24.533
Well, you have
to keep going, Zahir.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.100
In order
to honor them both,

19:27.166 --> 19:29.800
you have to galvanize your men
to complete the task

19:29.867 --> 19:31.400
Said set for you.

19:31.467 --> 19:33.967
- I tried to lead once before.

19:34.033 --> 19:36.367
I failed.

19:36.433 --> 19:38.934
- You know,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.533
Said and I didn't always agree,

19:42.600 --> 19:45.033
but I know one thing.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.500
This is the moment
he would've trusted in Allah.

19:50.633 --> 19:53.467
- I've spoken to the publisher
of Hill's book.

19:53.533 --> 19:56.066
He wants to go forward.

19:56.133 --> 19:58.867
So, it's up to us
to fulfill the promise,

19:58.934 --> 20:02.867
achieve the vision
of Minister Said.

20:02.934 --> 20:05.100
But first, we must choose
someone to lead.

20:08.867 --> 20:12.266
- I nominate Zahir Arif.

20:12.333 --> 20:13.700
All in favor?

20:22.433 --> 20:24.900
- Yo, what'd you call me?

20:24.967 --> 20:27.100
Yo, fuck you,
you greasy old bitch!

20:27.166 --> 20:28.767
- Hey, Poet!
- Oh, what,

20:28.834 --> 20:31.667
you think I don't know
where 122 Wayne Street is?

20:31.734 --> 20:34.100
Think again, bitch!

20:34.166 --> 20:36.066
- What the fuck's wrong
with you, son?

20:36.133 --> 20:37.667
- Nah, she said she
wasn't about to give

20:37.734 --> 20:40.133
her credit card number
to some strange spook.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.100
How the fuck she even know
I was black?

20:42.166 --> 20:44.333
- That's irrelevant.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.500
You hang up and calmly move on
to the next call.

20:47.567 --> 20:48.934
- No, man, fuck that.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.567
I ain't putting my pride
on the line

20:50.633 --> 20:53.100
so some bullshit senator
could get re-elected.

20:54.533 --> 20:56.400
- Well, in that case,
you're fired.

20:56.467 --> 20:59.400
- What?
- You heard me.

20:59.467 --> 21:02.133
Carry your lazy ass
and that bad attitude

21:02.200 --> 21:04.467
off the premises!

21:04.533 --> 21:06.400
Move it!
- Fuck you, Burr.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.266
Fuck you!

21:19.567 --> 21:22.567
- Well, what the fuck
you looking at?

21:22.633 --> 21:25.834
Get back to work!
All of you!

21:46.700 --> 21:49.266
- It's a good thing
we got out now, yo.

21:49.333 --> 21:52.767
I'm tellin' you.

21:52.834 --> 21:55.333
Man, that telemarketing, man,

21:55.400 --> 21:58.133
that shit short the brain.
- Yo, no shit.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.300
- But I'll tell you,
I got a plan, though.

22:00.367 --> 22:03.567
Yo, we go and work for Arif.

22:03.633 --> 22:05.533
McManus and the Sicilians

22:05.600 --> 22:08.033
will think we done dealing,
right?

22:08.100 --> 22:12.467
We lay low for a minute,
then we come back double-time

22:12.533 --> 22:15.467
up underneath the radar
without Burr.

22:15.533 --> 22:17.300
Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

22:17.367 --> 22:18.867
Yeah, son.

22:20.433 --> 22:22.300
- Sounds like quite
a crowd out there.

22:22.367 --> 22:23.900
- Yeah, I know.

22:23.967 --> 22:26.767
- So I spoke with Augustus' wife
and the Hudack family,

22:26.834 --> 22:30.066
and everyone's willing
to make a deal on the royalties,

22:30.133 --> 22:31.900
so we can move forward.

22:31.967 --> 22:34.900
It's exciting.
- Yeah, and terrifying.

22:34.967 --> 22:37.300
- Should we open the doors?

22:43.100 --> 22:44.633
- I want to work here.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.333
- Nacim, close the door.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.700
- Yo, we been out here
all this time!

22:51.767 --> 22:53.000
- Hold up
for just another minute.

22:53.066 --> 22:54.967
- What you doing?
- Hold up!

22:55.033 --> 22:57.500
- We need to pray.
We need to pray.

23:11.133 --> 23:13.400
- Miss Coffo?
- Hey.

23:13.467 --> 23:15.433
- Finished the book.
- That was fast.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.367
- It was good, funny.

23:17.433 --> 23:19.033
- Well, sit down and tell me
what you liked about it

23:19.100 --> 23:20.033
and what you didn't.

23:20.100 --> 23:21.467
- I can't right now.

23:21.533 --> 23:23.166
I got some business
to attend to.

23:23.233 --> 23:26.033
- Business?
- I'll come back tomorrow.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.700
In the meantime,
can you find me another book?

23:28.767 --> 23:30.233
- On baseball?
- Whatever.

23:30.300 --> 23:33.367
As long as it's funny
and good.

23:36.767 --> 23:38.633
- Bob, I'm a perfect mess.
Hello, Stella.

23:38.700 --> 23:40.467
Today's the day
I'm supposed to see Norma

23:40.533 --> 23:42.467
and suddenly I'm...wavering.

23:42.533 --> 23:44.400
- Don't waver, Agamemnon.

23:44.467 --> 23:45.967
- Put on a tie,
some aftershave,

23:46.033 --> 23:48.233
slick your hair back
like you always do.

23:48.300 --> 23:49.900
- Uh-uh.
It's time Norma and I

23:49.967 --> 23:51.700
see each other
for who we really are,

23:51.767 --> 23:53.767
liver spots and all.

23:53.834 --> 23:56.667
Why am I putting myself
through this?

23:56.734 --> 23:57.934
- Because a part of you
is in love,

23:58.000 --> 23:59.433
and that's the part
that matters.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.667
- You've been reading
too much poetry, Bob.

24:01.734 --> 24:03.233
Love sucks, remember?

24:13.567 --> 24:16.300
- Hello.
Nice to see you.

24:16.367 --> 24:17.834
- Please,
let's skip the pleasantries.

24:17.900 --> 24:19.100
We know why we're here.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.300
- I should just dive
right into an explanation.

24:21.367 --> 24:22.600
- After stranding me
at the altar

24:22.667 --> 24:23.867
and then getting pregnant?

24:23.934 --> 24:25.133
Yeah, I think that's
what you should do.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.967
- Okay.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.767
Basically, I got stuck
in that snowstorm

24:29.834 --> 24:31.734
on the way to our wedding.

24:31.800 --> 24:35.400
As I sat there, trapped,
I had time to think.

24:35.467 --> 24:37.233
All along,
I had told myself

24:37.300 --> 24:40.033
I could handle a marriage
to a man in prison.

24:40.100 --> 24:43.033
But sitting there,
I had clarity for the first time

24:43.100 --> 24:45.333
about how hard
it would really be.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.633
I used my cell phone
to call Elliot.

24:47.700 --> 24:49.200
- Elliot?
Who's Elliot?

24:49.266 --> 24:51.800
- The man I was with
when I met you.

24:51.867 --> 24:54.133
- You had a boyfriend
when we met,

24:54.200 --> 24:55.900
and you dumped him for me?

24:55.967 --> 24:57.600
- Yes.

24:57.667 --> 24:59.467
- Oh, wow.

24:59.533 --> 25:01.433
- Anyway, Elliot comes
and digs me out,

25:01.500 --> 25:03.166
and we go to dinner.

25:03.233 --> 25:04.467
He tells me his mom died,

25:04.533 --> 25:06.500
and I guess we both
kind of drowned our sorrows

25:06.567 --> 25:08.000
in a bottle of cheap wine.

25:08.066 --> 25:10.000
One thing led
to another and, well...

25:10.066 --> 25:11.533
- He had you for dessert.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.567
- But during the sex,
I thought of you.

25:13.633 --> 25:16.567
It's not a delusion,
what you and I feel.

25:16.633 --> 25:18.367
It's love.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.867
- "Think not
thou canst weep a tear

25:22.934 --> 25:25.433
"and thy Maker is not near.

25:25.500 --> 25:28.600
"Oh, He gives us His joy,

25:28.667 --> 25:31.867
"that our grief
He may destroy.

25:31.934 --> 25:35.734
"Till our grief
is fled and gone,

25:35.800 --> 25:38.734
He doth sit by us and moan."

25:41.166 --> 25:43.734
- I love the timbre
of your voice, Robert.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.533
- Wrap it up, Rebadow.
Five minutes to count.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.467
- Fine.
I'll be there in four.

25:50.533 --> 25:52.433
- Don't be late, lover boy.

25:56.233 --> 25:58.133
- Did you know that Blake
and his wife used to sit

25:58.200 --> 26:01.500
in their garden
and read to each other...naked?

26:02.967 --> 26:06.433
With no concern
for the passerby.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.633
- This may sound crazy, Stella,

26:09.700 --> 26:14.033
but I want to do that with you,
just once.

26:15.333 --> 26:16.834
- Oz has a garden?

26:18.900 --> 26:22.200
- I could pay a CO for privacy
and you could bring a plant.

26:25.166 --> 26:28.500
We'll lock the door,
kill the lights,

26:28.567 --> 26:29.834
sit by a candle to read

26:29.900 --> 26:32.133
"The Marriage
of Heaven and Hell,"

26:32.200 --> 26:34.166
naked as the day
we were born.

26:35.367 --> 26:37.700
- It's a lovely thought,

26:37.767 --> 26:43.433
but I don't know if I can even
finish what I've started here.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.834
Robert, I'm sick.

26:46.900 --> 26:49.767
I've been diagnosed
with breast cancer.

26:51.333 --> 26:54.700
Oh, don't start imagining
the worst.

26:54.767 --> 26:56.500
I'm gonna be okay.

27:04.900 --> 27:08.333
- I can't be late for count.

27:23.834 --> 27:25.800
- You okay?

27:25.867 --> 27:27.600
- Fine.

27:27.667 --> 27:31.567
- The most noncommittal word
in the English language, "fine."

27:31.633 --> 27:33.100
So, I've been thinking.

27:33.166 --> 27:35.367
I might let Norma
bring her baby in.

27:35.433 --> 27:38.300
- Oh?
- I'm not sure.

27:38.367 --> 27:41.967
But she did dump the jerk
for me in the first place.

27:42.033 --> 27:43.667
I guess the bottom line is
the ego doesn't need

27:43.734 --> 27:45.500
that much to rebound.

27:45.567 --> 27:46.500
- Uh-huh.

27:46.567 --> 27:49.266
- Besides, his name's Elliot.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.734
Who can be jealous
of a guy named Elliot?

27:53.967 --> 27:55.734
Bob, what's with you today?

27:55.800 --> 27:57.967
You do remember telling me
I should see her, don't you?

27:58.033 --> 28:01.467
- I forgot to say
to be careful.

28:01.533 --> 28:04.000
We're full of false fantasies,
Agamemnon.

28:04.066 --> 28:06.233
See her, yes,
but cover your ass.

28:06.300 --> 28:08.400
You said yourself
love sucks.

28:08.467 --> 28:10.400
There's nothing to be gained
from your pains

28:10.467 --> 28:12.867
except more pain.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.166
- Midway through
the 20th Century,

28:23.233 --> 28:28.300
man wants communication
without communication!

28:28.367 --> 28:31.100
He wants to sit
in his living room

28:31.166 --> 28:34.066
and watch people in a box...

28:34.133 --> 28:39.333
fall in love,
work, sing, golf,

28:39.400 --> 28:43.333
cry, fuck, and fuck up.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.166
Television!

28:46.233 --> 28:50.333
A one-way conversation
between you and the world,

28:50.400 --> 28:53.400
where the world does
the talking!

28:54.734 --> 28:57.500
Like God...

28:57.567 --> 29:02.633
man can finally create man
in his own image

29:02.700 --> 29:07.033
and then kick back and watch
all sorts of shit hit the fan.

29:10.867 --> 29:15.467
- Okay, Cyril, time for another
fabulous ECT treatment.

29:15.533 --> 29:17.600
- What's ECT?

29:17.667 --> 29:21.166
- Jesus, why is it every time
I gotta tell you what ECT means?

29:21.233 --> 29:24.333
- That's because electroshock
causes memory loss.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.633
- Oh.

29:27.367 --> 29:28.400
- Jazz?

29:30.633 --> 29:34.367
Jazz?

29:38.500 --> 29:40.967
- Jazz, it's very important
that we talk.

29:41.033 --> 29:43.200
Your execution is set
for next week.

29:43.266 --> 29:46.433
- 16 devils!
Today, there were 16!

29:51.333 --> 29:53.433
- I appreciate your stopping by
to see me, Miss Lang.

29:53.500 --> 29:57.367
- Hey, I'm thrilled when anyone
shows an interest in Jazz Hoyt.

29:57.433 --> 29:59.967
Arnie Zelman seems to be getting
all the death row publicity

30:00.033 --> 30:02.066
for his client, Cyril O'Reily.

30:02.133 --> 30:05.667
God.
Zelman is a PR genius.

30:05.734 --> 30:08.200
- How's Hoyt's appeal going?

30:08.266 --> 30:11.533
- Well, through the testimony
of various psychiatrists,

30:11.600 --> 30:13.300
some of whom
have been treating Hoyt

30:13.367 --> 30:15.100
since he was six years old,
I think I've been able

30:15.166 --> 30:17.266
to build a fairly solid case.

30:17.333 --> 30:20.233
- And your contention is that
he's always been crazy?

30:20.300 --> 30:21.834
- Yes.

30:21.900 --> 30:25.834
As a child,
he tortured animals...

30:25.900 --> 30:28.200
sodomized a playmate.

30:28.266 --> 30:30.233
- And where were his parents
during all of this?

30:30.300 --> 30:31.467
In a bar, drunk?

30:31.533 --> 30:34.400
- Actually, in Captiva.

30:34.467 --> 30:38.400
Hoyt comes from money,
Father Mukada, lots of money.

30:38.467 --> 30:41.800
He went to Exeter,
he dropped out of Harvard.

30:41.867 --> 30:45.700
This whole Jazz bad biker thing
is part of his delusion.

30:45.767 --> 30:48.934
- Holy shit, he's rich?

30:49.000 --> 30:51.400
- Well, who do you think's
paying for my fees?

30:51.467 --> 30:53.000
Pater and Mater.

30:58.066 --> 31:02.667
- Hearing the music,
and I saw another buffalo.

31:02.734 --> 31:06.333
And I saw a dog,
and I saw one...

31:08.166 --> 31:12.834
And I saw two wolves.

31:12.900 --> 31:17.100
I saw two...two wolves.

31:17.166 --> 31:18.934
- And on a more
controversial note,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.233
in a stunning defeat
for state prosecutors,

31:21.300 --> 31:23.900
convicted murderer
Jazz Hoyt's death sentence

31:23.967 --> 31:25.700
was overturned.

31:25.767 --> 31:28.400
Instead of being executed as
scheduled, Hoyt will be moved

31:28.467 --> 31:31.433
to the Oswald Correctional
Facility's psychiatric unit,

31:31.500 --> 31:33.367
then later
to the Connelly institute,

31:33.433 --> 31:35.633
a hospital in Morrisville
which specializes

31:35.700 --> 31:37.567
in treating
the criminally insane.

31:37.633 --> 31:39.333
- This is bullshit!
How come fuckin' Hoyt gets off

31:39.400 --> 31:40.567
and Cyril doesn't?

31:40.633 --> 31:42.166
- Well, from a purely
legal standpoint,

31:42.233 --> 31:44.433
the circumstances of each case
are very different.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.033
- So, you're telling me that,
in the eyes of the law,

31:46.100 --> 31:47.734
Jazz Hoyt's life
is worth preserving

31:47.800 --> 31:48.900
and my brother's isn't?

31:48.967 --> 31:50.967
- Afraid so, Ryan.
- God damn it!

31:51.033 --> 31:54.100
- Unless our latest appeal
is accepted by the court.

31:54.166 --> 31:56.867
Cyril dies
two weeks from Thursday.

31:56.934 --> 31:58.100
- Fuck.

32:04.367 --> 32:09.066
- Prisoner number 03N679,
Jahfree Neema,

32:09.133 --> 32:12.633
convicted January 10, 2003,
kidnapping, assault.

32:12.700 --> 32:17.066
Sentence: Seven years,
up for parole in three.

32:17.133 --> 32:19.567
- In other news,
'60s radical Jahfree Neema

32:19.633 --> 32:21.633
was convicted today
of kidnapping his daughter

32:21.700 --> 32:23.667
from the Pinkel
Day Care Center.

32:23.734 --> 32:25.900
Mr. Neema,
a prominent community leader

32:25.967 --> 32:27.467
on the city's eastside,

32:27.533 --> 32:30.567
was at one time involved
in the Black Panthers.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.333
- This castle hath
a pleasant seat.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.900
The air nimbly and sweetly
recommends itself

32:39.967 --> 32:42.166
unto our gentle senses.

32:42.233 --> 32:45.667
- This quest of summer,
the temple-haunting martlet--

32:45.734 --> 32:47.600
- All right, that's it.

32:47.667 --> 32:48.734
Rehearsal's over.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.934
- But I didn't even--

32:50.000 --> 32:52.066
- Tomorrow at 3:00!

32:52.133 --> 32:54.333
- It's okay, we'll get to it.
Thank you.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.166
- Things humming, Ma?
- Oh, Ryan.

32:56.233 --> 32:58.667
Well, not exactly.

32:58.734 --> 33:00.767
We haven't found anybody
to replace Schibetta

33:00.834 --> 33:02.567
in the lead and--

33:02.633 --> 33:03.834
Ryan, I need to talk to you,

33:03.900 --> 33:05.633
but I-I don't know
where to start.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.000
- Just start.

33:07.066 --> 33:10.033
Right.

33:10.100 --> 33:12.734
Jahfree Neema
is coming to Oz.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.900
- Hey, Mom, seriously.
- I, um, I know the man.

33:15.967 --> 33:17.000
Uh, at least I knew him.

33:17.066 --> 33:18.533
He--he was the one
that convinced me

33:18.600 --> 33:19.834
to join the peace movement.

33:19.900 --> 33:21.934
He was the one that--

33:22.000 --> 33:23.500
- He's the one that got you
to leave Dad

33:23.567 --> 33:26.734
and abandon me, right?

33:26.800 --> 33:28.533
- Well, that's one way
of putting it.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.800
You have to understand,

33:29.867 --> 33:32.033
he was very passionate
about his beliefs.

33:32.100 --> 33:33.834
He's a very charismatic man
and--

33:33.900 --> 33:36.567
- Did you fuck him?

33:36.633 --> 33:38.433
You did.

33:38.500 --> 33:39.734
- Ryan, look.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.633
We're both adults here.

33:41.700 --> 33:43.400
You know what it was like
living with your father.

33:43.467 --> 33:44.633
It was very repressive,

33:44.700 --> 33:46.700
and Jahfree helped me
to free myself,

33:46.767 --> 33:49.533
and I'm telling you this
because I want you to know

33:49.600 --> 33:52.333
that he changed my life
for the better.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.133
- Uh-huh.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.633
- I'm just asking you to be
open to him, that's all.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.934
- Yeah, can't wait
to meet him.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.467
Maybe I'll call him
Uncle Jahfree.

34:09.300 --> 34:10.800
Later, man.

34:10.867 --> 34:13.066
Hey.

34:13.133 --> 34:15.233
How they hanging there, bud?

34:15.300 --> 34:16.967
- Do I know you?

34:17.033 --> 34:18.333
- Indirectly.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.400
Suzanne Fitzgerald,
she's my mom.

34:21.467 --> 34:23.800
- So?

34:23.867 --> 34:25.533
Get out of my cell.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.800
- Uh, she just asked me
to come down here

34:27.867 --> 34:32.433
and try to, you know--
- Get out of my cell, white boy.

34:39.333 --> 34:41.100
- Asshole.

34:49.934 --> 34:51.867
- Hey, bitch!
- Got something for you, yo.

34:51.934 --> 34:52.967
- Hey.

35:19.066 --> 35:20.767
- Back in the '60s,

35:20.834 --> 35:23.900
the Department of Defense
created the Internet.

35:23.967 --> 35:26.834
Little did they know
they were mixing concrete

35:26.900 --> 35:29.133
to build the global village.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.000
There's nothing concrete
about it, though.

35:32.066 --> 35:36.000
People get digital mail
from electronic boxes,

35:36.066 --> 35:37.700
they congregate
in chat rooms

35:37.767 --> 35:39.800
that have no walls
and no doors.

35:39.867 --> 35:42.133
Millions around the world
have instant access

35:42.200 --> 35:46.066
to each other and stores
and food and entertainment.

35:46.133 --> 35:50.633
But if it's such a revolution
in communications,

35:50.700 --> 35:52.967
why do studies show

35:53.033 --> 35:56.033
the more time
one spends online,

35:56.100 --> 35:58.734
the more isolation
one suffers?

36:00.300 --> 36:03.266
- We've been contacted by
a lawyer for one Greg Penders,

36:03.333 --> 36:05.266
resident of
solitary confinement.

36:05.333 --> 36:06.834
He's suing the state.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.166
- Because of the methylene
chloride poisoning?

36:08.233 --> 36:11.100
- Yes, he says the death
of Carlos Martinez

36:11.166 --> 36:14.500
is proof the prison put his
own life in unnecessary danger.

36:14.567 --> 36:17.433
Penders is trying to get the
Martinez family and Omar White

36:17.500 --> 36:19.600
to join in the lawsuit.
- Christ.

36:19.667 --> 36:21.667
- I warned you not
to go public too soon,

36:21.734 --> 36:23.166
not to have
that press conference.

36:23.233 --> 36:24.800
- Ellie, please!

36:24.867 --> 36:26.700
The last thing I need
to hear right now is,

36:26.767 --> 36:28.066
"I told you so"!

36:32.200 --> 36:34.900
- This is gonna work, Omar,
I guarantee it.

36:34.967 --> 36:36.233
I guarantee it.

36:36.300 --> 36:38.667
The word's out that the air
in here is toxic,

36:38.734 --> 36:40.400
that it's lethal as shit.

36:40.467 --> 36:42.233
You got to join
my class-action suit.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.834
You got to do it.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.734
- I understand you want
to speak with me.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.700
- Omar, who's out there?
- Shh.

36:52.767 --> 36:53.800
- What's going on?

36:58.767 --> 37:02.900
- Okay, you let me out
of solitary, right,

37:02.967 --> 37:04.500
back to Em City?

37:04.567 --> 37:07.667
And I-I-I won't sue
with Penders.

37:07.734 --> 37:09.300
- That's all I get
in the deal?

37:09.367 --> 37:11.400
- Well, what more
do you want, man?

37:11.467 --> 37:15.100
Look around, I ain't got--
I ain't got much to offer.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.600
- Here's an idea.

37:17.667 --> 37:20.233
I put you back in Em City
and you don't mention a word

37:20.300 --> 37:24.900
of this conversation to anyone,
not a fucking syllable.

37:24.967 --> 37:26.533
- Oh, no,
fuck a syllable,

37:26.600 --> 37:28.367
I mean, not even--not even
a fucking letter, okay?

37:28.433 --> 37:31.467
- But if you do talk,

37:31.533 --> 37:34.734
I will build a cell so small,
you won't have room to stand.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.734
There'll just be room enough
for you

37:36.800 --> 37:38.667
and that yappity mouth of yours.

37:38.734 --> 37:40.834
Got it?

37:42.734 --> 37:45.467
We never spoke.

37:45.533 --> 37:46.467
- Omar!

38:00.500 --> 38:02.467
- White back in Em City?

38:02.533 --> 38:05.700
No fucking way, Leo!
I've had enough of his bullshit!

38:05.767 --> 38:07.800
- Tim, do you really expect me

38:07.867 --> 38:10.433
to put your headaches
with one inmate

38:10.500 --> 38:13.867
above the larger burdens
of this prison?

38:13.934 --> 38:16.300
I didn't think so.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.266
Allahu Akbar.

38:27.433 --> 38:29.533
Allahu Akbar.

38:29.600 --> 38:33.233
- Arif, man, where's--
where's my man Said?

38:33.300 --> 38:35.100
Allahu akbar.

38:35.166 --> 38:37.166
- Said, seriously,
where-where is he?

38:37.233 --> 38:39.633
- Said's dead, White.
- Huh?

38:39.700 --> 38:42.233
- Somebody shot him.
Come on.

38:42.300 --> 38:43.500
Come on, let's go.
- Huh?

38:45.200 --> 38:46.867
McManus.

38:46.934 --> 38:48.967
McManus?
McManus?

38:49.033 --> 38:50.834
- Today, White!

38:50.900 --> 38:53.533
- The autopsy report
on Carlos Martinez.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.233
You'll be glad to know
that he didn't die

38:55.300 --> 38:57.066
of methylene chloride poisoning.

38:57.133 --> 38:58.734
He suffocated,
or I should say

38:58.800 --> 39:00.266
he was suffocated
by someone else.

39:00.333 --> 39:01.533
- What?

39:01.600 --> 39:03.033
- I guess that's
one less plaintiff for you

39:03.100 --> 39:04.333
to worry about, right?

39:08.433 --> 39:09.700
- You still pissed off at me

39:09.767 --> 39:13.166
for not sending Martinez
to Benchley Memorial?

39:13.233 --> 39:15.233
- Yes.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.600
But not half as much
as I am at myself.

39:17.667 --> 39:21.367
You know what's
really disgusting about this?

39:21.433 --> 39:25.133
I'm relieved that a prisoner
was killed in his sleep

39:25.200 --> 39:28.533
instead of dying of what might
have been a preventable death.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.100
Now, I'm not guilty.

39:30.166 --> 39:35.667
Now, I'm just horrified to find
myself thinking this way.

39:35.734 --> 39:37.667
Do you know what?

39:37.734 --> 39:41.767
That is the last time
I take care of Oz over a person.

39:44.734 --> 39:46.133
- Great.

39:46.200 --> 39:49.433
Got another murder investigation
on my hands.

39:49.500 --> 39:50.633
- So, what are you
accusing me of,

39:50.700 --> 39:52.300
killing Martinez?

39:52.367 --> 39:56.266
- Look, normally, I could sweep
this thing under the rug,

39:56.333 --> 39:58.567
but since we've had
this rash of murders

39:58.633 --> 40:00.467
and I went public
with the methylene chloride

40:00.533 --> 40:02.567
promising to release
the autopsy,

40:02.633 --> 40:05.033
the media is not
gonna let this go.

40:05.100 --> 40:06.967
They're gonna scream
for an investigation.

40:07.033 --> 40:10.233
And I need to learn
every detail I can.

40:10.300 --> 40:12.400
- Okay, sorry.

40:12.467 --> 40:14.934
- You told Officer Murphy
that you visited Martinez

40:15.000 --> 40:16.133
just before he died.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.100
- Yeah.

40:18.166 --> 40:21.166
Martinez sent word
that he wanted to see me

40:21.233 --> 40:23.333
'cause he was desperate
to confess that Morales

40:23.400 --> 40:25.667
was the one who ordered him
to cut my tendon.

40:27.166 --> 40:28.967
- Did you see
anything suspicious?

40:29.033 --> 40:30.700
Any threat
from the other patients?

40:30.767 --> 40:32.133
- No.

40:32.200 --> 40:35.633
You ask me, one of the Latinos
did the deed, sir.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.934
They work as orderlies
in the ward.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.233
They had opportunity
and motive.

40:40.300 --> 40:44.400
- You mean to keep Martinez
from jabbering on Morales?

40:44.467 --> 40:46.500
- Yes.

40:48.767 --> 40:53.667
- Look, Dave, I'm gonna
bring in the homicide unit,

40:53.734 --> 40:56.133
same as I did
on the Loewen murder.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.867
They may want you to take
a lie detector test.

40:58.934 --> 41:01.200
- So, I am a suspect.

41:01.266 --> 41:05.266
- Unfortunately, for now,
you're the prime.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.900
- I'm so innocent,
that it hurts.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.600
- Then what are you
worried about?

41:11.667 --> 41:13.667
Take the fucking
lie detector test.

41:13.734 --> 41:16.233
- I can't.
- Why?

41:16.300 --> 41:18.600
- Because I did lie.

41:18.667 --> 41:20.133
- I don't understand.

41:20.200 --> 41:23.300
- I lied about Martinez
blaming Morales.

41:23.367 --> 41:25.233
- What?
- I didn't even see Martinez

41:25.300 --> 41:26.700
the night he died.

41:26.767 --> 41:28.834
- Oh, Jesus, Dave.

41:28.900 --> 41:32.367
- You and I both know
that Morales is guilty.

41:32.433 --> 41:35.033
I simply took Martinez's death
as an opportunity

41:35.100 --> 41:36.633
to nail that motherfucker.

41:36.700 --> 41:38.667
- So, what we did,
getting Morales in solitary,

41:38.734 --> 41:41.700
cutting him up...
- Was totally justified.

41:41.767 --> 41:43.667
- No, because we had no proof.

41:43.734 --> 41:46.533
- Don't get all righteous
with me, you bastard.

41:48.967 --> 41:53.500
It was my leg that got cut,
my life that got fucked.

41:53.567 --> 41:56.133
- Right, you gotta go tell Glynn
the truth, all right?

41:56.200 --> 41:58.066
'Cause we've got to get Morales
out of solitary.

41:58.133 --> 41:59.233
- No.

41:59.300 --> 42:01.934
- All right,
if you don't, I will.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.333
- Fuck that!
- Stop! Fuck!

42:04.400 --> 42:06.266
- For Jesus' sake,
stop it.

42:06.333 --> 42:08.533
Stop it.
Go, go.

42:08.600 --> 42:09.900
- Do it.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.266
- Dr. Nathan?

42:31.333 --> 42:33.166
- Oh, hi.

42:33.233 --> 42:34.867
Come in.

42:36.100 --> 42:38.033
Thanks for coming.

42:38.100 --> 42:41.100
Look, I want to apologize
for getting so upset

42:41.166 --> 42:44.000
the night Martinez died
and for firing you.

42:44.066 --> 42:46.567
The chemical poisoning thing
in solitary

42:46.633 --> 42:49.367
has put me under
a lot of stress,

42:49.433 --> 42:52.166
and I know what it's like
to get blamed for things

42:52.233 --> 42:54.633
that really aren't
under your control.

42:54.700 --> 42:57.400
And if you still want your job,
it's yours.

42:57.467 --> 42:59.166
- Oh, Dr. Nathan, thank you.

42:59.233 --> 43:01.934
I'll do my best, I swear,
to make you proud.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.033
- Well, let's get to work.

43:10.700 --> 43:13.900
- Enrique, I heard about
what happened.

43:13.967 --> 43:16.233
- Get away from me,
you Judas.

43:16.300 --> 43:19.233
- Hey, I'm no Judas.
- Did you kill Martinez?

43:19.300 --> 43:21.834
Did anybody in El Norte
kill Martinez?

43:21.900 --> 43:23.133
- No.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.700
- Then move the fuck away
from me.

43:24.767 --> 43:25.800
Muevete!

43:27.867 --> 43:29.233
- Everything okay here?

43:29.300 --> 43:31.033
- Can I have some juice?

43:33.233 --> 43:35.834
- Too bad about
your friend Martinez.

43:38.133 --> 43:40.934
But he was a nasty man.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.867
He deserved to die.

43:58.100 --> 44:00.667
- Yo.

44:00.734 --> 44:04.200
I'm glad you came.
- It's good to see you, too.

44:04.266 --> 44:05.400
You look a shitload better than
you did

44:05.467 --> 44:06.867
the last time I was here.

44:06.934 --> 44:09.033
- You know, I hit a couple
of potholes, you know.

44:09.100 --> 44:11.433
I'm cruising now, man,
70 miles an hour

44:11.500 --> 44:14.834
with the fucking top down,
you know?

44:14.900 --> 44:16.300
Speaking of which,
how's my car?

44:18.066 --> 44:19.834
- I don't know, bro.

44:19.900 --> 44:21.266
- What you mean
you don't know?

44:21.333 --> 44:23.100
I got convicted,
I gave you the keys,

44:23.166 --> 44:24.166
told you to treat her
like a lady.

44:24.233 --> 44:25.967
- I did, man.
I fine-tuned her.

44:26.033 --> 44:28.133
I polished her up, but--
- What?

44:28.200 --> 44:30.667
- Maritza gets out of Parker's,
bro, and she sells it.

44:30.734 --> 44:31.834
- What?

44:31.900 --> 44:33.266
- She said that car
was the cause

44:33.333 --> 44:35.600
of all her grief, so...

44:35.667 --> 44:38.200
- She didn't tell me nothing
about selling the car.

44:43.900 --> 44:45.700
You seen her lately?
- Oh, yeah.

44:45.767 --> 44:47.934
I mean, you know,
all the time.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.500
I mean, we live right across
the street from each other,

44:49.567 --> 44:50.800
remember?

44:50.867 --> 44:52.133
- Right.

44:52.200 --> 44:54.500
Gotta ask you something.

44:54.567 --> 44:57.867
I need you to tell me
the truth, okay?

45:00.667 --> 45:01.734
She fucking anyone?

45:01.800 --> 45:03.967
- Oh.
Miguel, man, I--

45:04.033 --> 45:06.967
- Yo, bro, bro,
I can feel it, man.

45:07.033 --> 45:09.300
Okay?
I know she is.

45:09.367 --> 45:11.900
Now, we've been like brothers,
man, a long time.

45:11.967 --> 45:14.233
We ain't ever lied
about nothing.

45:16.333 --> 45:17.867
Yo, I need to know.

45:19.867 --> 45:22.333
Tell me, okay?

45:22.400 --> 45:23.433
Who's the guy?

45:23.500 --> 45:25.667
- I don't--
I don't think you--

45:27.867 --> 45:31.367
- Bro...
tell me, who's the guy?

45:31.433 --> 45:33.900
- Me.

45:33.967 --> 45:36.633
- It's me.
Look, I'm sorry, Miguel.

45:36.700 --> 45:38.133
Man, I got no excuses, bro.

45:38.200 --> 45:41.000
What happened,
it just happened.

45:41.066 --> 45:43.266
- You cocksucker.

45:43.333 --> 45:44.934
- You gonna hit me?
Go ahead, hit me.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.300
- Come on.

45:46.367 --> 45:48.266
- Espero que se caiga.

45:48.333 --> 45:51.367
- Okay, Alvarez, time's up.
Let's go.

45:59.667 --> 46:03.433
- Now that I know
the truth about Maritza,

46:03.500 --> 46:06.800
in a fucked-up way...

46:06.867 --> 46:10.300
I feel better, you know?

46:10.367 --> 46:14.900
I mean, just the not knowing
was totally eating me alive.

46:17.700 --> 46:20.433
I'm surprised
about two things.

46:20.500 --> 46:22.033
I haven't cried,

46:22.100 --> 46:25.533
and I didn't pound
the shit out of Reynaldo.

46:25.600 --> 46:29.166
That's a good thing, right?

46:29.233 --> 46:34.567
I mean, everything happens
for the best...right?

46:39.934 --> 46:44.467
I wanted to kill him...

46:44.533 --> 46:46.100
but I didn't.

46:52.934 --> 46:55.500
So, I don't know,
I'm making progress.

47:01.500 --> 47:03.600
- So, what's next,
microchips in the brain?

47:03.667 --> 47:06.300
The ability to read
each other's minds?

47:06.367 --> 47:07.900
Too late.

47:07.967 --> 47:10.734
A primitive tribe
in the other Oz,

47:10.800 --> 47:14.900
Australia,
already beat us to it.

47:14.967 --> 47:18.166
They talk by not talking.

47:18.233 --> 47:20.266
Yeah, they're way,
way ahead of us

47:20.333 --> 47:22.066
in the realm
of communications,

47:22.133 --> 47:25.266
and they didn't have
to invent squat to get there.

47:25.333 --> 47:31.000
They stayed connected
in the original sense...

47:31.066 --> 47:33.800
in the aboriginal sense.

47:41.233 --> 47:42.767
I'm done.

47:44.400 --> 47:46.467
Which means you're done, too.

47:46.533 --> 47:48.967
Now, go get me a towel.

48:02.166 --> 48:03.934
- Hey, Robson.

48:06.100 --> 48:08.333
How's that bitch thing coming?
- Get away from me.

48:08.400 --> 48:11.734
- Listen, the only people
who hate Cutler more than you

48:11.800 --> 48:13.500
is us.

48:13.567 --> 48:16.233
So, why not do everybody
a favor?

48:16.300 --> 48:17.233
- Ace him?

48:17.300 --> 48:18.967
- Ain't no downside.

48:19.033 --> 48:21.266
It proves to the Brotherhood
you're still a man.

48:21.333 --> 48:24.867
- And it'll make you a lot
of friends in the kitchen.

48:24.934 --> 48:26.934
Win-win.

48:34.600 --> 48:36.033
- "I'll go no more.

48:36.100 --> 48:38.467
"I am afraid to think
what I have done.

48:38.533 --> 48:41.934
Look on't again,
I dare not."

48:42.000 --> 48:44.600
- "Infirm of purpose!

48:44.667 --> 48:46.567
"Give me the daggers.

48:46.633 --> 48:50.133
The sleeping and the dead--"
- Hang on, stop, stop.

48:50.200 --> 48:52.066
I don't fucking get this.

48:52.133 --> 48:53.934
- Well, what's confusing you,
Wolfgang?

48:54.000 --> 48:55.967
- Well, I just killed
the king, right?

48:56.033 --> 48:57.633
- Right.
- I come downstairs

48:57.700 --> 48:59.567
with these bloody daggers,

48:59.633 --> 49:01.867
and now,
I'm like a complete pussy.

49:01.934 --> 49:06.133
- Hmm, uh, well, see, um...

49:06.200 --> 49:09.533
Macbeth is conflicted about
the implications of his act.

49:09.600 --> 49:11.133
- And I'm supposed
to let this bitch

49:11.200 --> 49:12.600
take care of things for me?

49:12.667 --> 49:13.667
- You can't seem
to do it yourself.

49:13.734 --> 49:15.066
- Watch it, buttercup.

49:15.133 --> 49:17.200
Uh, um...

49:17.266 --> 49:20.934
could you just take a look
at the last line of the scene?

49:21.000 --> 49:24.700
- "To know my deed,
'twere best not know myself."

49:24.767 --> 49:26.166
- And what does that mean
to you?

49:26.233 --> 49:27.900
- Why don't you just tell me?

49:27.967 --> 49:29.567
- That you would
hate yourself

49:29.633 --> 49:31.567
if you ever thought about
the things you've done.

49:31.633 --> 49:34.400
- Like I said,
Macbeth's a pussy.

49:34.467 --> 49:37.433
Don't fuckin' move!

49:44.000 --> 49:45.433
- Yeah, fuck.

49:55.467 --> 49:57.300
- Take that shit off
your fucking head.

50:03.800 --> 50:06.233
So you like that, prag?

50:13.600 --> 50:15.633
You know what
we should try?

50:15.700 --> 50:17.467
- We should try?

50:17.533 --> 50:20.700
When did I start giving a shit
about your input around here?

50:20.767 --> 50:22.166
- B.C.P.

50:22.233 --> 50:25.133
- What the fuck is that?

50:25.200 --> 50:27.567
- Breath control play.

50:27.633 --> 50:30.033
First, you make a noose, see?

50:30.100 --> 50:31.667
- Keep talking.

50:31.734 --> 50:33.300
- Then you put it
around your neck.

50:33.367 --> 50:35.333
- My neck?

50:35.400 --> 50:37.266
Are you fucking kidding me?

50:37.333 --> 50:39.367
- No, hear me out.

50:39.433 --> 50:41.467
You put the noose
around your neck

50:41.533 --> 50:44.834
and then you hang yourself,
lightly.

50:44.900 --> 50:48.100
And all the blood
from your head

50:48.166 --> 50:50.066
rushes straight to your dick,

50:50.133 --> 50:53.266
and then I blow you.

50:55.500 --> 50:57.200
When you get off,

50:57.266 --> 51:01.166
it's like God himself
is swallowing.

51:03.300 --> 51:05.000
- So, where's the noose?

51:08.600 --> 51:12.533
Who would have thought those
things would have so many uses?

51:17.433 --> 51:21.667
- I was telling you that shit
about my dad.

51:21.734 --> 51:24.433
Well, in many ways,
I've become him.

51:24.500 --> 51:29.233
I mean, I've done shit to guys
that I'm not proud of.

51:29.300 --> 51:31.734
But in other ways,

51:31.800 --> 51:35.567
I'm still that little boy
getting fucked in the shed.

51:35.633 --> 51:37.934
- Is someone sodomizing you,
James?

51:39.266 --> 51:43.033
- Wolfgang Cutler.

51:43.100 --> 51:46.633
Here I am again,
shacked up with a psychopath.

51:50.433 --> 51:54.667
But I'm older now,
seeing it with different eyes.

51:58.934 --> 52:00.166
- What are you seeing?

52:00.233 --> 52:02.700
- In Cutler?

52:02.767 --> 52:07.633
A guy who, deep down,
is really depressed,

52:07.700 --> 52:09.734
really hates himself.

52:11.600 --> 52:14.734
It's how his gaze
goes totally blank

52:14.800 --> 52:16.300
while he's--

52:20.100 --> 52:24.700
Well, I think
he'd be happier dead.

52:24.767 --> 52:27.600
And the thing is,

52:27.667 --> 52:31.533
sometimes his mood
goes so dark,

52:31.600 --> 52:33.333
I think he may do himself.

52:33.400 --> 52:35.433
- Has he talked
about suicide?

52:35.500 --> 52:37.133
- No.

52:37.200 --> 52:39.433
But with all this
"Macbeth" shit,

52:39.500 --> 52:42.867
it's really fucked him up.

52:42.934 --> 52:48.300
Sister, maybe you
could talk to him, huh?

52:49.600 --> 52:52.000
Before he does something
terrible to himself.

52:58.367 --> 53:00.967
- Wolfgang, I requested
a session with you,

53:01.033 --> 53:04.300
but since it was supposed
to have started 40 minutes ago,

53:04.367 --> 53:05.800
I guess you're not showing up.

53:05.867 --> 53:09.433
- You and me got nothing
to talk about, Sis.

53:09.500 --> 53:11.900
I'm not crazy.

53:11.967 --> 53:14.900
- Crazy is not the only reason
folks come to see me.

53:14.967 --> 53:18.000
- Shrinks are for fags.

53:18.066 --> 53:20.400
- Wolfgang, you don't have to--
- Listen, bitch.

53:20.467 --> 53:22.066
- Problem, Sister?

53:25.333 --> 53:28.200
- No.

53:28.266 --> 53:30.400
Never mind.

53:49.567 --> 53:52.834
- Oh, morning, Wolfie.

53:52.900 --> 53:56.266
Jeez, I guess I forgot
to untie you last night.

54:01.834 --> 54:04.633
Holy shit.

54:04.700 --> 54:08.800
Officer?
Officer!

54:11.900 --> 54:14.633
- Base 1,
we got an 823 in B.

54:18.066 --> 54:21.467
Well, ain't that a kick?

54:21.533 --> 54:23.867
One of you actually went
and lynched yourselves.

54:36.033 --> 54:38.767
- When man goes collectively mad
from downloading

54:38.834 --> 54:41.900
all the mental messages
in the air,

54:41.967 --> 54:44.934
when there's no trees left

54:45.000 --> 54:47.967
'cause we needed all that paper
for the printing press

54:48.033 --> 54:51.033
and therefore are left
with no oxygen to breathe,

54:51.100 --> 54:54.300
then satellites
will fry from overuse

54:54.367 --> 54:57.133
and drop from the sky.

54:57.200 --> 54:59.734
And we'll make desperate
cell phone calls

54:59.800 --> 55:01.467
to our loved ones

55:01.533 --> 55:05.533
while watching Mother Earth's
last days on reality TV.

55:06.800 --> 55:10.300
Communications
will be once again

55:10.367 --> 55:12.233
what it was in the beginning.

55:12.300 --> 55:16.033
- The Word, moving over
the face of the deep,

55:16.100 --> 55:18.867
over the face of God,
who now,

55:18.934 --> 55:23.166
instead of wanting to talk,
is tired of listening.
