WEBVTT

00:07.974 --> 00:09.930
Here you go, Doc... Your usual.

00:10.186 --> 00:12.063
How lovely it is to have a usual.

00:15.155 --> 00:18.067
- What is this?
- Latte with nutmeg and cinnamon.

00:18.369 --> 00:21.725
That's my brother's usual.
I'm the double Kona with cream.

00:23.463 --> 00:25.738
Oh, Frasier - am I glad to see you.

00:26.010 --> 00:28.570
- Your usual, Doc?
- Please.

00:32.314 --> 00:34.066
Thank you.

00:34.861 --> 00:38.012
Niles, you seem more than usually
agitated today. A problem?

00:38.326 --> 00:40.442
I'm meeting my publisher here.

00:40.706 --> 00:43.266
Remember my book deal you envied?

00:43.545 --> 00:45.615
I wasn't jealous, Niles.

00:45.883 --> 00:48.556
Well, the deal's about to be killed.

00:48.847 --> 00:51.600
My idea had already been done.

00:51.895 --> 00:56.605
I need to find an alternative today
and I've got bubkis - less than bubkis.

00:56.988 --> 01:00.617
I've got what bubkis keeps for lint
in the bottom of his pocket.

01:00.955 --> 01:04.664
- Can you ask for an extension?
- No, I've had two already.

01:05.004 --> 01:08.792
Oh, God, there he is.
Sam, so good to see you.

01:09.138 --> 01:12.733
- Niles.
- Sam Tanaka, Dr Frasier Crane.

01:13.062 --> 01:14.734
Nice to meet you.

01:14.983 --> 01:17.417
- Coffee?
- I'll have what he's having.

01:17.697 --> 01:19.608
So you shall.

01:19.868 --> 01:22.098
One more, please.

01:22.372 --> 01:26.763
- Wait, you're the doctor from the radio.
- Guilty as charged.

01:27.132 --> 01:30.090
- I listen to your show all the time.
- Oh, thank you.

01:30.388 --> 01:32.777
I never realized you two were brothers.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.733
All our lives!

01:37.110 --> 01:40.864
You must have incredible insight
into sibling relationships.

01:41.202 --> 01:44.592
No more than your average
psychiatrist brothers.

01:44.918 --> 01:47.557
(Laughs)
So, Niles, what's your idea?

01:47.840 --> 01:50.308
(Sobs and clears throat)

01:50.595 --> 01:53.632
My idea - well, Sam,
I've given it a lot of thought...

01:53.936 --> 01:57.451
- There may be a book in that.
- In what?

01:57.777 --> 02:02.567
Two psychiatrist brothers
writing about sibling relationships.

02:02.954 --> 02:07.470
That, Sam, is exactly the idea
we were going to pitch to you!

02:07.839 --> 02:09.511
- What?!
- Terrific!

02:09.758 --> 02:11.670
I hate to interrupt...

02:11.930 --> 02:15.286
Gentlemen,
I'm going to cancel my lunch date

02:15.603 --> 02:17.912
so I can take you two out to celebrate.

02:18.192 --> 02:22.470
Oh, well, we were
going to write today, but OK.

02:22.827 --> 02:25.785
What are you doing? I don't wanna
write a book. I'm outta here.

02:26.083 --> 02:30.315
Frasier, I know it's asking a big favour,

02:30.676 --> 02:35.909
All my life I have dreamed of one thing -
the day I could go into a library

02:36.312 --> 02:40.066
and see my name
under "mental illness".

02:44.913 --> 02:48.622
The day I could finally feel
what you feel - that I'm somebody,

02:48.962 --> 02:52.477
not just one more
dusty little psychiatrist.

02:52.803 --> 02:54.873
Oh, Niles...

02:55.141 --> 02:59.054
We haven't collaborated since
the spring musicale in prep school.

02:59.399 --> 03:01.833
Yes, well, it was well received.

03:02.489 --> 03:05.367
It did get us out of gym class.

03:06.622 --> 03:10.171
- It could be like that again.
- I don't know, Niles.

03:10.505 --> 03:14.418
# Um-ta, um-ta, um-ta, da-da-da-da

03:14.764 --> 03:18.473
# Oh, some boys go to college
But we think they're all wussies

03:18.814 --> 03:24.366
# Cos they get all the knowledge
And we get all the... Um-ta, um-ta... #

03:24.784 --> 03:26.900
- All right, I'll do it!
- Yes!

03:29.209 --> 03:31.325
(Doorbell)

03:32.758 --> 03:35.556
- <i>Dumas frère!</i>
- <i>Dumas frère!</i>

03:35.848 --> 03:40.524
- Hello, what are you doing over here?
- It's our first writing session.

03:40.900 --> 03:44.893
- I thought that was at Niles's house.
- Unfortunately, it's Maris's turn

03:45.241 --> 03:49.280
to host her sherry-tasting group
and things get a little raucous.

03:49.625 --> 03:54.460
- But the Sonics are on in 20 minutes.
- I bought you these headphones.

03:54.844 --> 03:58.393
You'll be able to listen to the TV
without disturbing Niles and me.

03:58.726 --> 04:01.718
How's Eddie gonna hear?

04:03.946 --> 04:07.382
He can read about the game
in tomorrow's paper.

04:08.496 --> 04:10.612
Try them out there.

04:12.587 --> 04:15.545
(Shouts) Hey, not bad!

04:16.178 --> 04:20.057
- Very clever solution.
- It also has another little feature.

04:20.394 --> 04:25.594
Watch this.
Hey, Dad... Nice shirt (!)

04:26.532 --> 04:29.968
Did they throw that in the last time
you had your tyres rotated (?)

04:32.795 --> 04:35.229
Tell us about
when you met Eisenhower.

04:35.508 --> 04:37.817
We haven't heard that story this hour (!)

04:40.393 --> 04:43.430
OK. My turn. Hey, Dad...

04:43.733 --> 04:47.726
Say another word
and I'll club you both with my cane.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.495
This is great, thanks a lot.

04:54.755 --> 04:56.746
Watch out for this for me, Eddie.

04:57.177 --> 05:00.135
I got to get a snack. Who wants a beer?

05:00.433 --> 05:02.424
Just you.

05:02.687 --> 05:06.123
This is no time to procrastinate.

05:06.445 --> 05:08.197
OK, here we go.

05:08.449 --> 05:12.158
Chapter one, page one, paragraph one.

05:12.499 --> 05:14.455
(Key clicks)
I'm indenting!

05:18.302 --> 05:21.021
I hate to squash your enthusiasm,

05:21.308 --> 05:26.143
but shouldn't we discuss
what the book is going to be about?

05:27.487 --> 05:31.480
Forgive me for just barrelling
ahead, but damn it, I'm jazzed!

05:33.749 --> 05:36.821
We have to approach this book
from a completely different angle

05:37.132 --> 05:40.408
than all of our previous writing -
our dissertations, our theses.

05:40.722 --> 05:43.190
Right. This has to be interesting.

05:45.189 --> 05:48.022
The obvious approach is case histories.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.791
Anecdotes about siblings
we've dealt with in our practice.

05:53.164 --> 05:57.077
If we throw in a few heaving bosoms
we'll make Book of the Month Club.

05:59.092 --> 06:02.926
I could tell you a couple
of stories about you guys.

06:03.267 --> 06:07.101
That's an interesting idea.
We'll use ourselves in the introduction.

06:07.442 --> 06:09.398
I like the introduction idea.

06:09.654 --> 06:12.771
Give us your best story
- the one with little Niles

06:13.079 --> 06:16.071
and little Frasier at their conflicted best.

06:17.295 --> 06:21.732
When we went trout fishing,
you guys were at it tooth and nail.

06:22.097 --> 06:24.895
- This is good.
- What's the lake called?

06:25.186 --> 06:27.063
The name is immaterial.

06:27.315 --> 06:30.034
It's an Indian word,
Lake Watchahatchee?

06:30.321 --> 06:34.758
- You're missing the point.
- Your mother knew but she's dead.

06:36.291 --> 06:40.330
Watchakootchie? Coochawatchie?
It was an Indian word.

06:40.675 --> 06:43.667
- It meant "land of a thousand..."
- Dad...

06:43.974 --> 06:46.966
This is driving me nuts.
I have to look it up.

06:47.272 --> 06:51.663
- We just want the story.
- Where the hell did I put my atlas?

06:53.242 --> 06:57.360
- Quite a resource, isn't he (?)
- We'll just put the introduction on hold.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.825
Back to case histories.

07:00.089 --> 07:03.320
I suppose I could get my files
out of storage after the...

07:04.514 --> 07:07.586
Niles,
is there a light bulb over my head?

07:09.232 --> 07:13.942
- You have an idea?
- No, is there actually a light bulb (?)

07:15.870 --> 07:20.580
Of course I have an idea!
What better source than my show?

07:20.964 --> 07:23.432
I'll ask listeners to call in with stories

07:23.719 --> 07:26.791
of sibling conflict
and you can be my guest.

07:27.101 --> 07:31.094
You're suggesting we exploit
your listeners for our own gain?

07:32.237 --> 07:34.148
In essence, yes.

07:35.576 --> 07:39.251
- What do you think?
- It's borderline sleazy. Go for it.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:48.269 --> 07:50.146
Hello, Roz.

07:50.398 --> 07:53.834
- What's your brother doing here?
- He's going to be my guest.

07:54.156 --> 07:56.033
I don't think so.

07:56.285 --> 08:00.801
I am the producer, and I approve
the guests. I do not approve him.

08:01.170 --> 08:04.640
- OK, bye-bye, have a good show.
- OK, he's approved.

08:05.094 --> 08:09.167
But I will not get him coffee
and I'm not taking any of his crapola.

08:09.519 --> 08:12.955
Niles, welcome aboard.
Five seconds to air.

08:13.277 --> 08:18.351
OK, Niles - sit down, take a deep
breath, try not to spit on the mike.

08:18.746 --> 08:21.419
Right.

08:21.710 --> 08:25.180
Hello, Seattle. This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I have a very special guest today,

08:25.510 --> 08:28.707
my brother,
the eminent psychiatrist Dr Niles Crane.

08:29.017 --> 08:32.726
Hello, emerald city!
What's doin', what's happenin'?

08:37.116 --> 08:39.835
What do you think you're doing?

08:40.121 --> 08:43.159
That was my radio persona.
Every great radio personality has one.

08:43.462 --> 08:45.612
- I don't.
- My point exactly.

08:47.428 --> 08:49.498
Just try to be yourself.

08:49.766 --> 08:53.076
Our topic today is siblings -

08:53.399 --> 08:55.913
what makes you love them,
hate them...

08:56.196 --> 08:58.505
What things do they do to annoy you?

08:58.784 --> 09:02.174
These could be things
from your childhood or adolescence,

09:02.500 --> 09:06.459
- your young adulthood...
- or...

09:06.800 --> 09:10.839
They could be things
that are going on right now!

09:11.184 --> 09:14.654
- Roz, who's our first caller?
- Donald from Bainbridge Island.

09:14.983 --> 09:18.373
He hasn't spoken to his brother
in 20 years.

09:18.699 --> 09:23.056
- Hello, Donald, I'm...
-..listening.

09:24.878 --> 09:27.438
We're listening.

09:28.928 --> 09:33.001
(Woman) 'I'll never forget it.
I cried for two hours straight.'

09:33.354 --> 09:35.265
So you were completely bald?

09:35.524 --> 09:38.561
'Yes, the perm destroyed my hair.'

09:38.864 --> 09:42.652
'l was sure my sisters were gonna
laugh at me but they all kissed me.

09:42.997 --> 09:47.673
'Then they shaved their heads too,
so I wouldn't feel like a freak.'

09:50.221 --> 09:53.418
Amazing!
Well, there you have it, Seattle -

09:53.727 --> 09:56.116
the miracle of the sibling relationship

09:56.400 --> 09:59.631
spelled out in an unselfish act
of head-shaving.

10:00.825 --> 10:05.580
Time's up. I'd like to thank
my brother for being here today.

10:05.960 --> 10:09.032
Niles, I would shave my head for you.

10:10.219 --> 10:14.007
A gesture which becomes less
significant with each passing year.

10:18.736 --> 10:20.966
This is Dr Frasier Crane.

10:21.241 --> 10:25.678
I'll be back tomorrow -
one Crane flying solo.

10:28.380 --> 10:32.134
Frasier, we've hit the mother lode.
We've material here for two volumes.

10:32.472 --> 10:35.509
I apologize for criticizing
your radio programme.

10:35.811 --> 10:37.767
All water under the <i>Pont Neuf.</i>

10:38.024 --> 10:41.699
I hate to break this up
but there's a Sam Tanaka on line one.

10:43.661 --> 10:47.654
- Hello, Sam, you're on speakerphone.
- 'l caught the show today, fellows.'

10:48.002 --> 10:49.879
You did? And?

10:50.131 --> 10:52.087
'Magic! (Laughs)

10:53.764 --> 10:56.881
- 'How's the writing coming?'
- Flowing like water.

10:57.188 --> 10:59.543
We've got two or three
chapters already.

10:59.818 --> 11:03.857
'That's good because I just got off
the phone with "Reader's Digest".

11:04.202 --> 11:07.717
'They're interested
in the serialization rights.

11:08.042 --> 11:12.399
'l need first few chapters to give
them a taste. Can you fax them?'

11:13.804 --> 11:17.956
Well, Sam, uh, of course we could,
but they're a little rough.

11:18.313 --> 11:21.510
'No problem.
You've got till Friday to polish them up.

11:21.820 --> 11:23.776
'You can do that, right?'

11:24.033 --> 11:26.388
- Absolutely.
- Friday's fine.

11:26.663 --> 11:29.780
'Terrific! I love you guys!'

11:30.086 --> 11:32.600
What are we gonna do?

11:32.884 --> 11:34.920
We just have to put
the material together.

11:35.180 --> 11:38.934
- It's due on Friday.
- Then we'll do it by FRlDAY!

11:39.272 --> 11:44.062
Wait. George and Ira Gershwin
would lock themselves in a hotel room

11:44.449 --> 11:47.600
and not come out
until their task was complete.

11:47.914 --> 11:50.269
Brilliant! After this volume

11:50.544 --> 11:53.502
we can write another chorus to
"Bess, You Is My Woman Now".

11:55.638 --> 12:00.029
It's clean, it's Spartan,
totally devoid of charm.

12:00.398 --> 12:04.277
- It's perfect. Let's get to work.
- I'm with you, <i>mon frère.</i>

12:04.614 --> 12:07.686
We cannot be intimidated
by the tyranny of the blank page.

12:09.039 --> 12:11.633
All we need to get a good start here

12:11.920 --> 12:16.198
- is room service!
- Frasier!

12:16.555 --> 12:20.946
All right. All we need
is a good opening sentence -

12:21.314 --> 12:24.909
something that will smack
the reader right between the eyes

12:25.238 --> 12:29.595
and take him on a roller coaster ride
of self-awareness and discovery.

12:29.956 --> 12:33.471
Frasier, while you're mixing
metaphors, I've had a breakthrough.

12:36.636 --> 12:39.548
<i>Voilà!</i> Our opening sentence

12:39.851 --> 12:42.126
"From Romulus and Remus
to the Lennon sisters,

12:42.398 --> 12:47.426
"sibling relationships have sparked
psychological debate worldwide."

12:47.825 --> 12:50.544
- Hmm... Interesting.
- You like it?

12:50.831 --> 12:52.867
I said it was interesting.

12:53.127 --> 12:57.325
The question is whether we'd like
an interesting opening or a good one.

13:00.058 --> 13:03.607
- Just because you didn't think of it.
- I never liked Romulus or Remus,

13:03.941 --> 13:08.298
and the "Lennon sisters" reference
is from the freaking moon.

13:08.659 --> 13:11.776
If you can do better, be my guest.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.642
- I will.
- All right.

13:17.092 --> 13:19.731
My fingers are poised over the keys.

13:27.989 --> 13:29.945
I'm waiting.

13:37.925 --> 13:40.723
I'm still waiting.

13:41.015 --> 13:43.529
Oh, all right. Put this down.

13:43.812 --> 13:46.770
"The key
to a good sibling relationship

13:47.068 --> 13:50.060
"is the ability
to be open and honest."

13:51.285 --> 13:53.799
- That actually sounded good to me.
- Well, put that in there.

13:54.082 --> 13:58.121
"The key to a good sibling relationship
is the ability to be open and honest...

13:58.467 --> 14:03.257
"while still respecting
each other's boundaries."

14:04.646 --> 14:08.116
What are you doing?
What was that crap about boundaries?

14:08.445 --> 14:10.754
I was just finishing the thought.

14:11.033 --> 14:14.867
The thought was finished.
It didn't need finishing.

14:15.208 --> 14:17.517
- I think it's better this way.
- I don't.

14:17.797 --> 14:19.867
- I'm at the keyboard.
- Let me type.

14:20.134 --> 14:23.206
- I need the keyboard.
- You ruined a good opening sentence!

14:23.517 --> 14:27.112
- It was an incomplete thought.
- Oh, YOU'RE an incomplete thought!

14:28.944 --> 14:32.823
- What happened to the iced tea?
- I finished that, too.

14:45.351 --> 14:47.228
(Sighs)

14:47.481 --> 14:50.598
Niles, I've just had an epiphany.

14:51.990 --> 14:56.142
Oh, wonderful -
we could use a second sentence (!)

14:56.499 --> 14:59.377
No, it's not for the book.

14:59.672 --> 15:04.700
I just realized why so many writers
become bloated, alcoholic suicides.

15:06.143 --> 15:08.498
No, don't type that in.

15:08.774 --> 15:12.926
I'm not.
I'm adding up our tab from the mini-bar.

15:14.619 --> 15:18.851
- We now owe $232.
- Oh, dear God!

15:19.211 --> 15:22.920
Well, you ate the jar
of Macadamia nuts.

15:23.261 --> 15:26.697
No, it's dawn! It's Friday!

15:27.018 --> 15:31.409
Admit it. We can't work together.
There's never gonna be any book.

15:31.945 --> 15:36.223
- Not with that attitude.
- Oh, get off it! The fat lady has sung.

15:36.579 --> 15:40.254
The curtain has been rung down.
I'll type it for you.

15:42.633 --> 15:44.703
"It's oover"?

15:45.848 --> 15:47.964
Let's go home.

15:48.227 --> 15:51.981
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
you'd give up so easily.

15:52.319 --> 15:57.154
It's not your dream. Why should it be,
Mr Big-shot Radio Host?

15:58.540 --> 16:03.933
Oh, is that what this tantrum is about?
You're jealous of my celebrity?

16:04.343 --> 16:08.780
It's not a tantrum and I'm not jealous.
I'm just FED UP!

16:11.524 --> 16:14.436
Fed up with always being second.

16:14.739 --> 16:19.210
I wanted to be a psychiatrist like Mom
way before you did, but you were older.

16:19.582 --> 16:23.177
You got married first.
You had a child first.

16:23.507 --> 16:26.817
By the time I get around to doing
anything it's all chewed meat!

16:27.138 --> 16:31.290
- It's something we can't change.
- Oh, you love it!

16:31.648 --> 16:35.277
- Oh, let it go, Niles.
- My nose is rubbed in it every day.

16:35.614 --> 16:39.289
I'm on the board
of the Psychiatric Association.

16:39.622 --> 16:42.739
Four of my patients
have been elected to political office.

16:43.045 --> 16:46.162
But it's your big, fat face
they put on the side of buses!

16:46.468 --> 16:48.777
I do not have a FAT FACE!

16:49.057 --> 16:53.130
I keep wondering how long you're
gonna store those nuts for winter.

16:55.278 --> 16:58.190
Well, at least I'm not spindly!

16:58.535 --> 17:01.368
- Who're you calling spindly?
- You!

17:01.666 --> 17:03.941
- Fat face!
- Spindly!

17:04.212 --> 17:07.089
- You take that back!
- You make me!

17:07.385 --> 17:09.421
I will! Here's making you!

17:15.569 --> 17:18.685
Here's your fat face! Give me that!

17:22.583 --> 17:27.292
Niles! Niles! Stop it!
We're psychiatrists, not pugilists!

17:29.847 --> 17:31.917
I can't believe you fell for that!

17:38.782 --> 17:41.979
(Niles shouts)
My God, I'm having a flashback!

17:42.288 --> 17:45.200
You're climbing in my crib
and jumping on me!

17:45.503 --> 17:48.620
YOU STOLE MY MOMMY!

17:50.722 --> 17:54.476
Oh, my God, Niles!
I got to get out of here.

17:54.814 --> 17:58.011
This entire idea has been a fiasco.

17:58.320 --> 18:01.437
I should have never agreed. Goodbye!

18:07.005 --> 18:09.200
- Good morning, all.
- Morning.

18:09.468 --> 18:12.221
- You seem chipper.
- And why shouldn't I be?

18:12.515 --> 18:14.585
Well, it's gonna rain,
the jobless rate's up,

18:14.854 --> 18:17.288
and Eddie was just licking that muffin.

18:20.908 --> 18:22.546
DOORBELL

18:22.787 --> 18:25.142
I'll get it.

18:25.416 --> 18:28.806
A mature man knows
he cannot control his circumstances,

18:29.132 --> 18:33.011
- only his response.
- You talked to your brother yet?

18:33.349 --> 18:36.182
I do not have a brother!
I'm an only child.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.436
Oh, hello, Dr Crane.

18:38.693 --> 18:40.888
Hello, Daphne... Dad.

18:42.910 --> 18:45.185
What are you doing here?

18:45.456 --> 18:49.608
Dad, I would like you to convey
a message from me to Frasier.

18:51.093 --> 18:54.290
What makes you think
I know where he is?

18:59.234 --> 19:03.386
He owes me half this hotel bill.
I will accept no cheques.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.860
I know he has trouble writing things (!)

19:08.879 --> 19:13.316
- I'm not paying any of this.
- So, you're cheap and stupid.

19:13.680 --> 19:17.514
- And you're a no-talent hack!
- And you look stupid in a T-shirt!

19:17.855 --> 19:21.609
All right, that's enough.
Sit down and listen to me.

19:21.946 --> 19:23.902
Sit down.

19:25.536 --> 19:27.492
Sit down.

19:29.377 --> 19:33.768
I never had a brother, but I had
a partner once - Mitch Gossett.

19:34.137 --> 19:37.095
Big bear of a guy, arms like tree trunks.

19:37.393 --> 19:39.827
We'd go to ball games.
We played cards,

19:40.107 --> 19:42.667
and this was after
working all day together.

19:42.947 --> 19:45.415
- That's nice, but...
- Just listen to me.

19:47.413 --> 19:52.806
Three months into our partnership,
Goss and I got assigned to a stakeout -

19:53.217 --> 19:59.292
three days in the front of a Chevy Nova,
drinking too much coffee.

19:59.730 --> 20:03.518
Pretty soon we started
getting on each other's nerves.

20:03.864 --> 20:07.061
Because he was a big,
egotistical fat face?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.657
Because we were human.

20:11.921 --> 20:15.630
He didn't like this about me,
I didn't like that about him. It got ugly.

20:15.971 --> 20:17.927
When the stakeout ended,

20:18.183 --> 20:20.856
Goss requested a transfer,
and that was fine by me.

20:22.818 --> 20:26.936
Three months later,
he was stabbed breaking up a bar fight.

20:27.285 --> 20:30.038
By the time I got to the hospital,
it was too late.

20:32.378 --> 20:35.654
Take what you want
from this story, boys.

20:35.969 --> 20:39.245
All I know is, it ain't worth it.

20:40.896 --> 20:43.456
Excuse me. I think I need a hanky.

20:43.734 --> 20:47.010
Frasier, isn't there something
you want to say to your brother?

20:48.661 --> 20:51.539
Yes, Dad, I suppose there is.

20:53.587 --> 20:55.862
Niles, would you like a muffin?

21:02.063 --> 21:05.180
- Frasier!
- Oh, all right.

21:09.119 --> 21:11.075
Niles,

21:11.331 --> 21:14.289
I'm sorry things
didn't work out with the book.

21:14.587 --> 21:17.897
You have no reason
to feel inferior to me.

21:18.220 --> 21:22.008
You're an accomplished psychiatrist,
a decent man,

21:22.353 --> 21:25.026
and you stand second to no one.

21:26.946 --> 21:29.414
Thank you, Frasier.

21:30.620 --> 21:34.693
The truth is, I've always
looked up to you and admired you.

21:35.046 --> 21:37.321
Enough of this mushy, girly stuff.

21:37.592 --> 21:41.983
Just shake hands, punch each other
on the shoulder and be done with it.

21:43.938 --> 21:48.090
- Oh, what the heck!
- Oh, jeez!

21:51.829 --> 21:53.785
(Sniffs)

21:54.042 --> 21:58.399
- What are you crying about?
- I keep thinking about poor Goss.

21:58.759 --> 22:01.717
It must be so hard on you
carrying all that pain around.

22:02.016 --> 22:05.326
There was no Goss. I made him up.

22:05.648 --> 22:08.481
Well, at least there's one
good writer in this family.

22:13.789 --> 22:18.624
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.509 --> 22:20.703
# Mercy!

22:20.929 --> 22:25.639
# And, maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:28.110 --> 22:32.820
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:33.955 --> 22:37.231
# They're calling again
Good night, everybody! #

22:38.305 --> 22:44.543
