00:01.655 --> 00:05.137
Previously on "Survivor"

00:05.172 --> 00:11.172
At the kama tribe, aurora, joe,
And aubry were outcasts.

00:12.586 --> 00:14.551
Nobody wants to talk to us.

00:14.586 --> 00:19.344
At the manu tribe,
Wendy was ruffling feathers.

00:19.379 --> 00:22.034
All creatures deserve to Live.

00:22.068 --> 00:24.068
Do not tell me that we can't
Eat that chicken.

00:24.103 --> 00:29.931
But would go had a
Plan of his own.

00:29.965 --> 00:31.620
I decided maybe it's not Wendy.

00:31.655 --> 00:34.724
It's chris.

00:34.758 --> 00:37.965
At tribal council,
Chris was voted out.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.034
Chris, the tribe has spoken.

00:43.068 --> 00:48.586
Go
Home or grab the torch and go to.

00:48.620 --> 00:51.620
The edge of extinction.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.827
I can't believe it!

01:16.862 --> 01:18.310
I am still processing it.

01:18.344 --> 01:20.931
You know I'm not... >> you!

01:20.965 --> 01:21.931
I'm not sad.

01:21.965 --> 01:23.586
They got me.

01:23.620 --> 01:25.068
How's it feel?

01:25.103 --> 01:26.758
Terrible.

01:26.793 --> 01:28.758
I just feel betrayed.

01:29.827 --> 01:32.965
That's how it feels?

01:33.000 --> 01:33.310
Betrayal?

01:33.344 --> 01:34.034
Really?

01:34.068 --> 01:37.034
Man, I got blindsided.

01:37.068 --> 01:38.517
Man, I can't believe it.

01:38.551 --> 01:41.586
Seriously, you voted me out, and
He totally blindsided keith, so.

01:41.620 --> 01:43.551
That is a taste of your own
Medicine.

01:43.586 --> 01:44.827
Give me a break.

01:44.862 --> 01:48.172
You're not going to show up here
And be treated with open arms.

01:48.206 --> 01:49.793
No thank you.

01:49.827 --> 01:50.448
No.

01:50.482 --> 01:51.344
This is what I went through.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.689
Read the sign, bro.

01:52.724 --> 01:55.724
"If at any point you wish to
End your adventure, raise the."

01:55.758 --> 01:57.827
"Sail, and a boat will pick you
Up."

01:57.862 --> 02:01.103
you're not going to come in
Here to the freaking holiday.

02:01.137 --> 02:02.551
Inn.

02:02.586 --> 02:03.551
Sorry.

02:03.586 --> 02:09.550
It's the edge of extinction.

02:17.448 --> 02:23.862
I'm actually not as good as
Chris.

02:23.896 --> 02:26.379
Wendy looks skinny.

02:26.413 --> 02:29.206
Your waist looks small.

02:29.241 --> 02:31.793
"Survivor" diet.

02:31.827 --> 02:36.068
Wendy's always under threat
Of going home, but it's never

02:36.103 --> 02:37.344
Wendy.

02:37.379 --> 02:38.872
Everybody has different styles
Of playing the game, and this is.

02:38.896 --> 02:39.758
Mine.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.862
You don't know what I'm going to
Do next.

02:41.896 --> 02:43.631
But, at the same time, I
Understand that I was being.

02:43.655 --> 02:47.413
Crazy for taking the flint, so I
Put the flint back and, like,

02:47.448 --> 02:48.413
David found it.

02:48.448 --> 02:50.896
And he said, "You guys, you
Found the flint."

02:50.931 --> 02:52.586
"And everybody is like," Look.

02:52.620 --> 02:53.700
It mysteriously popped up."

02:53.724 --> 02:57.965
she literally took the flint.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Like that's not normal.

03:01.034 --> 03:03.034
I'm not even close to being
Done.

03:03.068 --> 03:04.758
I already told rick my master
Plan.

03:04.793 --> 03:05.689
What is it?

03:05.724 --> 03:06.586
What's your master plan?

03:06.620 --> 03:07.965
I don't want to tell you.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.413
You're going to get mad at me.

03:09.448 --> 03:13.103
God you are... I've never
Either played with or seen.

03:13.137 --> 03:14.586
Anybody play the way you do.

03:14.620 --> 03:15.827
Like a wild card.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.044
You want to win, don't you?

03:17.068 --> 03:18.241
Yeah, of course I do.

03:18.275 --> 03:20.551
Okay.

03:20.586 --> 03:21.793
I... Okay.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.931
Hey, look, I haven't been
Eliminated so far, so something.

03:24.965 --> 03:26.206
Must be work.

03:26.241 --> 03:30.206
I feel like if I just go with
The flow, things will work out.

03:30.241 --> 03:32.931
This should really be wendy.

03:32.965 --> 03:33.724
Right.

03:33.758 --> 03:35.034
100%.

03:35.068 --> 03:36.310
Nobody playing games.

03:36.344 --> 03:39.551
Only because she's literally,
Like, living in her own little.

03:39.586 --> 03:41.346
Eye don't even know what's going
On up there.

03:41.379 --> 03:47.620
Why do you have such a
Ridiculously small shell?

03:47.655 --> 03:51.620
Right now there are five
People working it, and wendy is.

03:51.655 --> 03:52.344
The outsider.

03:52.379 --> 03:55.172
She's not a normal person.

03:55.206 --> 03:57.448
She hid our flint and thought it
Was funny.

03:57.482 --> 03:58.655
Who does that!

03:58.689 --> 04:01.000
She's always going to be this
Person you won't be able to.

04:01.034 --> 04:01.482
Trust.

04:01.517 --> 04:02.517
Wendy is the vote.

04:02.551 --> 04:09.965
That seems to make the most
Sense for everybody.

04:10.000 --> 04:18.000
Come on in, guys!

04:19.551 --> 04:22.793
Kama getting your first look at
The new manu tribe.

04:22.827 --> 04:25.620
Chris, voted out at the last
Tribal council.

04:25.655 --> 04:27.206
My god!

04:27.241 --> 04:28.655
So wrong!

04:28.689 --> 04:31.724
That may be the
Biggest reaction I've ever seen.

04:31.758 --> 04:33.241
To a vote-out.

04:33.275 --> 04:35.896
Ron, what is it that you're
Reading into seeing chris being.

04:35.931 --> 04:37.172
Voted out?

04:37.206 --> 04:39.458
You see how hard he works in
Challenges and you you see he.

04:39.482 --> 04:42.448
Was carrying all... the whole
Entire tribe.

04:42.482 --> 04:46.586
It & to see they would vote him
Out, it's almost like a.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.758
Betrayal.

04:47.793 --> 04:51.137
Wow, lauren, big
Words, "Betrayal," and "Chris.

04:51.172 --> 04:53.482
Was carrying the entire tribe."

04:53.517 --> 04:56.655
I think it's interesting to
Throw out words like that when.

04:56.689 --> 04:59.344
You have no idea what our camp
Life is like.

04:59.379 --> 05:03.172
Once again, it speaks
To the true, unpredictable.

05:03.206 --> 05:04.310
Nature of this game.

05:04.344 --> 05:06.448
Because you're right, you don't
Know what's going on.

05:06.482 --> 05:08.034
Everybody, drop your buffs.

05:08.068 --> 05:10.344
Jeff probst!

05:10.379 --> 05:15.310
You're switching from
Two tribes to three tribes.

05:15.344 --> 05:16.551
Expansion to three.

05:16.586 --> 05:21.689
When jeff said, "Drop your
Buffs," I literally turned to

05:21.724 --> 05:26.862
Joe and said, "I'm going to pee
My pants right now."

05:26.896 --> 05:28.931
You have this pit in your
Stomach.

05:28.965 --> 05:31.000
You have no control over that
Part of the game.

05:31.034 --> 05:34.000
It is completely random who you
End up with.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.689
It's turns your game upside
Down.

05:35.724 --> 05:36.758
He we are.

05:36.793 --> 05:37.931
The moment of truth.

05:37.965 --> 05:38.758
Everybody reveal.

05:38.793 --> 05:40.344
Here we go.

05:40.379 --> 05:41.448
Good luck y'all.

05:41.482 --> 05:43.310
If you're blue goes.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.931
Go to blue.

05:44.965 --> 05:46.803
Yellow goes to yellow, and green
In the middle.

05:46.827 --> 05:47.379
I'm green.

05:47.413 --> 05:48.068
I'm green.

05:48.103 --> 05:49.275
My god!

05:49.310 --> 05:49.655
We're the whole tribe!

05:49.689 --> 05:50.689
Wow!

05:51.379 --> 05:51.482
The happy family staying
Together, I guess.

05:52.275 --> 05:53.758
Everybody find your Spot...

05:53.793 --> 05:54.620
you're green.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.793
My god, I'm green!

05:56.827 --> 05:57.862
I thought I was blue.

05:57.896 --> 06:00.034
This is crazy.

06:00.068 --> 06:05.034
At first glance, everybody is
With their own former tribe.

06:05.068 --> 06:09.206
Members with one exception,
Wendy, the only lone wolf not.

06:09.241 --> 06:10.758
With her own original pack.

06:10.793 --> 06:11.724
No way!

06:11.758 --> 06:12.551
Holy crap.

06:12.586 --> 06:13.586
My god!

06:13.620 --> 06:14.724
I am stunned.

06:14.758 --> 06:16.758
We're stunned.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.827
Would have been nice to meet
You guys.

06:18.862 --> 06:22.034
Gavin, you've been a
Fan of this game since you were.

06:22.068 --> 06:22.758
A kid.

06:22.793 --> 06:24.034
Ever recall a switch like this?

06:24.068 --> 06:26.827
I don't think so but I'm
Happy to be a part of this one.

06:26.862 --> 06:28.275
So I'm all smiles right now.

06:28.310 --> 06:32.034
All right, we have
Three new tribes, and we end up.

06:32.068 --> 06:36.068
With, on manu, four members from
Kama, and one original member.

06:36.103 --> 06:37.103
From manu wendy.

06:37.137 --> 06:37.862
Yes.

06:37.896 --> 06:39.655
How are you feeling right Now?

06:39.689 --> 06:42.517
Because if "Survivor" is a game
Of numbers, and these four are.

06:42.551 --> 06:43.631
Tight, you would be in trouble.

06:43.655 --> 06:45.034
Yeah, I would be in trouble.

06:45.068 --> 06:48.172
But all of these people look
Very athletic so I don't think.

06:48.206 --> 06:49.827
We're going to lose challenges.

06:49.862 --> 06:54.206
Down at kama, five
Original kama, still wearing.

06:54.241 --> 06:56.655
Yellow, still going back to the
Same camp.

06:56.689 --> 07:00.551
And in the middle, with a
Brand-new tribe, five former.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.241
Manu, your tribe name, lesu.

07:03.275 --> 07:03.620
Lesu.

07:03.655 --> 07:07.689
L-e-s-u.

07:07.724 --> 07:09.344
That sounds about right.

07:09.379 --> 07:12.724
Kama, grab your stuff
And literally head back to camp.

07:12.758 --> 07:14.344
Thanks, jeff.

07:14.379 --> 07:15.896
Have fun, guys.

07:15.931 --> 07:17.517
Manu, grab your Stuff.

07:17.551 --> 07:18.448
Wendy, show them around camp.

07:18.482 --> 07:20.551
Good luck with the chickens,
Joe.

07:20.586 --> 07:23.896
Wendy is gonna hate him if he
Kills the chicken.

07:23.931 --> 07:27.655
Lesu, a map to your New home.

07:27.689 --> 07:31.034
I could not believe we were
Still together.

07:31.068 --> 07:33.862
And wendy is still on the tribe
With her tightest alliance,

07:33.896 --> 07:34.862
Which is the chicken.

07:34.896 --> 07:36.344
And I'm think, good luck.

07:36.379 --> 07:37.379
Good luck with wendy.

07:56.758 --> 07:59.551
Insane!

07:59.586 --> 08:01.206
Kama!

08:01.241 --> 08:02.482
Kama!

08:02.517 --> 08:04.700
Coming into this tribe swap,
I was super nervous because I.

08:04.724 --> 08:11.586
Really didn't know where I stood
With the original o.G. Kama.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.665
Tribe, but our numbers got cut
In half so a new dynamic.

08:13.689 --> 08:14.907
Kama strong, one, two, three.

08:14.931 --> 08:17.034
Kama strong!

08:17.068 --> 08:21.344
I think the one difference
I'm doing this season than past.

08:21.379 --> 08:28.724
Season I'm trying to build more
Strong, solid relationships.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.172
Sand everywhere, sandy.

08:30.206 --> 08:33.034
I feel really good with aurora.

08:33.068 --> 08:35.620
Early on I feel like we'll
Connected and I do feel like.

08:35.655 --> 08:36.895
She's on my side.

08:36.931 --> 08:39.251
But there are only five of us,
And I want to make sure we have.

08:39.275 --> 08:41.102
A little bit of a majority
Going.

08:41.136 --> 08:43.493
I'm really trying to solidify a
Relationship with ron, who I.

08:43.517 --> 08:46.517
Seem to have a pretty good
Rapport with.

08:46.551 --> 08:49.586
I feel great with you, bro.

08:49.620 --> 08:51.448
I feel agreement with you, Too.

08:51.482 --> 08:53.448
And I think aurora would vote
With us.

08:53.482 --> 08:55.827
Every time I talk with her she's
Nothing but smiles and.

08:55.862 --> 08:58.275
Lovey-dovey and awesome.

08:58.310 --> 09:01.379
Like we're in a really... we're
In a great spop spot.

09:01.413 --> 09:03.931
I'm just trying to think of,
Like, down the road, who is.

09:03.965 --> 09:06.172
Going to try to take me out?

09:06.206 --> 09:11.000
The last thing I would want
To do.

09:11.034 --> 09:12.862
Nobody's going to vote you out.

09:12.896 --> 09:13.275
That's ridiculous.

09:13.310 --> 09:14.758
I hope not.

09:14.793 --> 09:17.182
I had a great conversation with
Joe at the watering hole because

09:17.206 --> 09:19.413
I had to convince him I was with
Him.

09:19.448 --> 09:22.724
I acted like I love him, I adore
Him.

09:22.758 --> 09:26.344
And he was like, "All right,
Ron, I got you."

09:26.379 --> 09:26.931
Back at kama.

09:26.965 --> 09:27.827
Kama, kama.

09:27.862 --> 09:29.275
Best tribe.

09:29.310 --> 09:32.034
So he's walk around feeling
Really confident.

09:32.068 --> 09:36.413
What he doesn't know 20 minutes
Ago I told julia, why don't you.

09:36.448 --> 09:38.000
Go through joe's bag.

09:38.034 --> 09:46.034
I'll keep him at the watering
Hole.

09:49.103 --> 09:51.034
I have to make sure joe
Doesn't have an idol.

09:51.068 --> 09:53.931
Because if we lose a challenge,
I may consider voting him out.

09:53.965 --> 09:56.965
He's too big of a threat, and
He's a challenge beast, and we.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.275
Need to get him out as quickly
As possible because if we get to.

10:01.310 --> 10:07.034
The merge, they could be really
Dangerous.

10:07.068 --> 10:08.068
Hey, julia.

10:08.103 --> 10:09.931
You find anything?

10:09.965 --> 10:11.172
No.

10:11.206 --> 10:13.493
There was nothing in there,
Nothing in his pants, nothing in.

10:13.517 --> 10:15.034
His bag of sea shells.

10:15.068 --> 10:17.034
I don't think he has it.

10:17.068 --> 10:18.344
Good job.

10:18.379 --> 10:20.734
We're probably not going to lose
A challenge when you look at how.

10:20.758 --> 10:24.103
Strong our tribe sand if we do
Have to worry about it, we know.

10:24.137 --> 10:26.206
That joe doesn't have an idol.

10:26.241 --> 10:34.241
He's going to be an easy target.

10:35.517 --> 10:37.620
You guys, the odds of that.

10:37.655 --> 10:38.724
That's a small percent.

10:38.758 --> 10:44.620
You take a constant, four out of
13, four out of 11.

10:44.655 --> 10:46.344
You multiply that four times.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.965
It's less than 1%.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.827
I was looking at those tribes, I
Think in challenges we stack up.

10:50.862 --> 10:54.517
Really well with those two
Tribes.

10:54.551 --> 10:58.965
I think we do.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.275
That's all we have to do.

11:00.310 --> 11:01.482
That's all we need to do.

11:01.517 --> 11:02.941
The good thing about being
All together on the new lesu.

11:02.965 --> 11:06.689
Tribe is we have relationships
Together.

11:06.724 --> 11:07.931
We trust each other.

11:07.965 --> 11:09.976
The problem is if we don't win,
We're going to fracture real.

11:10.000 --> 11:10.896
Quick.

11:10.931 --> 11:13.620
I wonder what wendy is
Contingent them.

11:13.655 --> 11:14.103
Everything.

11:14.137 --> 11:15.344
Everything.

11:15.379 --> 11:18.310
Wendy was the odd duck out
And we could all really around.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.517
That and now we're all looking
At each other.

11:20.551 --> 11:22.620
There's no odd person out.

11:22.655 --> 11:23.827
There's no distraction.

11:23.862 --> 11:27.862
We just know that if we lose,
One of us is going home, and.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.241
Thus far, we have not been good
At winning.

11:30.275 --> 11:31.803
We should definitely get a
Fire going.

11:31.827 --> 11:32.482
Yeah.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.103
Coming to a new camp sucks.

11:34.137 --> 11:35.896
There is no shelter.

11:35.931 --> 11:38.137
There's very little rice.

11:38.172 --> 11:39.827
How crazy is this?

11:39.862 --> 11:43.896
This is insane.

11:43.931 --> 11:47.689
Being a returning player, I
Know "Survivor" is hard.

11:47.724 --> 11:55.344
Even the strongest person can
Break under these circumstances.

11:55.379 --> 11:56.620
You okay?

11:56.655 --> 11:59.689
Yeah, I just thought I was
Going to throw up for a second.

11:59.724 --> 12:02.724
But we're good.

12:02.758 --> 12:06.000
I think I thought coming out
Here would be super fun, and,

12:06.034 --> 12:09.344
Like, I really underestimated
How difficult it is to not.

12:09.379 --> 12:10.620
Expeet to not sleep.

12:10.655 --> 12:18.655
It's a lot harder than I was
Ever expecting it to be.

12:21.620 --> 12:22.896
I'm so hungry.

12:22.931 --> 12:26.655
But, like, I can't eat the rice
Anymore because it just makes me.

12:26.689 --> 12:27.344
Really nauseous.

12:27.379 --> 12:28.586
I know, it tastes so good.

12:28.620 --> 12:31.655
But more than, that I think
The hardest part for me is not.

12:31.689 --> 12:33.413
Being able to talk to my family.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.862
I really miss my mom and dad a
Lot.

12:35.896 --> 12:40.758
And it's really hard not to have
That support system that tells.

12:40.793 --> 12:44.172
You, like, "It's okay."

12:44.206 --> 12:46.310
Like "Everything's going to be
Okay."

12:46.344 --> 12:48.965
So you're just kind wife these,
You know, four other people that.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.344
You kind of trust, but they're
Not your family.

12:52.379 --> 12:58.379
They're just people that you're
Competing against.

13:08.862 --> 13:10.976
Why don't we go down to the
Beach and I can give you the.

13:11.000 --> 13:11.793
Grand tour.

13:11.827 --> 13:13.137
That's perfect.

13:13.172 --> 13:14.551
We have the entire beach.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.482
And the beaches kind of meet
Right there.

13:16.517 --> 13:19.413
And there's our makeshift fire
Pit.

13:19.448 --> 13:21.379
That's a clever idea.

13:21.413 --> 13:25.344
If you guys want tree mail,
It's down that path.

13:25.379 --> 13:29.482
There are a bunch of sharks so
This is the best place to fish.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.517
So then... >> this is the well.

13:31.551 --> 13:32.241
Nice.

13:32.275 --> 13:34.034
Thanks for showing us around.

13:34.068 --> 13:35.310
It's your camp, too.

13:35.344 --> 13:36.620
Yeah, thank you.

13:36.655 --> 13:41.793
I am really excited about the
Tribe flop.

13:41.827 --> 13:44.275
We have four kama with the loan
Manu.

13:44.310 --> 13:45.965
If we liewrkz we've got wendy.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.896
She's the easy pickoff.

13:47.931 --> 13:49.172
You've got spunk, girl.

13:49.206 --> 13:50.344
You did.

13:50.379 --> 13:51.689
You've got spunk.

13:51.724 --> 13:52.758
Right on.

13:52.793 --> 13:55.620
The I think is that's tough
Sireally like wendy.

13:55.655 --> 13:58.448
She is very sweet and she's a
Kind heart.

13:58.482 --> 14:01.517
Our camp was nice but we
Didn't have the views you have.

14:01.551 --> 14:02.551
Here.

14:02.586 --> 14:04.493
We have the views, but, like,
My tribe sucked.

14:04.517 --> 14:04.965
Really?

14:05.000 --> 14:05.862
Really.

14:05.896 --> 14:07.320
I'm happy I got stuck with
You guys.

14:07.344 --> 14:09.724
I don't care if I'm on the
Bottom.

14:09.758 --> 14:10.448
They were bullies.

14:10.482 --> 14:12.068
Really?

14:12.103 --> 14:12.689
Serious?

14:12.724 --> 14:18.689
Who is the ring leader.

14:18.724 --> 14:22.689
That girl is giving me
Everything about the manu tribe.

14:22.724 --> 14:25.655
She's giving us a full rundown
Of every single player.

14:25.689 --> 14:28.103
You don't think dave and
Kelley want to play together?

14:28.137 --> 14:30.103
From what I've seen, I don't
Think so.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.275
This girl is a wealth of
Information.

14:32.310 --> 14:33.000
And these an save the.

14:33.034 --> 14:35.655
Where are the chickens at?

14:35.689 --> 14:36.896
Did you kill them yet?

14:36.931 --> 14:39.344
We have two left.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.172
We have fishing gear.

14:41.206 --> 14:44.241
Do they lay any eggs?

14:44.275 --> 14:49.965
They're going to start laying
Some.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.551
You think they will start
Laying?

14:52.586 --> 14:54.275
I think so.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.562
Chickens seem to be doing Good.

14:55.586 --> 14:57.137
They're cute, aren't they?

14:57.172 --> 15:01.310
Hey, chickens, no pressure
But you better start laying.

15:01.344 --> 15:05.379
Eggs, or I'm going to eat you.

15:05.413 --> 15:08.586
I think you just cut the head
Off, and then you boil it, I.

15:08.620 --> 15:09.413
Think.

15:09.448 --> 15:11.137
And then the feathers come out
Easy.

15:11.172 --> 15:14.172
Rotisserie chicken.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.241
I genuinely like my new Tribe.

15:36.275 --> 15:38.413
I feel really bad doing this.

15:38.448 --> 15:43.068
I know on their agenda was to
Kill these chickens and,

15:43.103 --> 15:46.965
Obviously, I have my own agenda.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.137
And I finally released the
Chickens!

15:50.172 --> 15:50.724
They're free!

15:50.758 --> 15:55.068
Their lives are saved.

15:55.103 --> 15:56.827
This is my faster plan.

15:56.862 --> 15:58.068
I'm ecstatic.

15:58.103 --> 16:02.896
I just have to head back now, go
To sleep and pretend, "What?"

16:02.931 --> 16:03.517
What?

16:03.551 --> 16:04.344
What chickens?

16:04.379 --> 16:10.034
I'm so happy!

16:10.068 --> 16:14.413
It's raining, bro.

16:21.206 --> 16:29.206
Okay, now it's coming.

16:31.241 --> 16:39.241
Okay, now it's coming.

16:40.965 --> 16:43.517
All you could do was just sit
There in your wetness and just.

16:43.551 --> 16:44.793
Be angry, be mad.

16:44.827 --> 16:47.034
Be hungry, be whatsoever.

16:47.068 --> 16:49.000
It just sucks.

16:49.034 --> 16:52.724
The mind is the strongest thing
You have out here, but it's also.

16:52.758 --> 16:54.000
The most dangerous thing.

16:54.034 --> 16:57.000
It has made me look at that
Mast, raising that mast is a.

16:57.034 --> 16:58.793
Complete losing solution.

16:58.827 --> 17:00.275
Like, that mast is my food.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.586
That mast is my burger.

17:01.620 --> 17:02.758
It's a nice bed.

17:02.793 --> 17:03.620
It's a hot shower.

17:03.655 --> 17:05.689
It's a freaking dry towel.

17:05.723 --> 17:07.792
That mast is everything.

17:07.827 --> 17:11.482
So right now my mind is my
Freaking best friend, but also.

17:11.517 --> 17:12.034
My worst enemy.

17:12.068 --> 17:13.068
You all right?

17:13.931 --> 17:14.758
You all right?

17:14.792 --> 17:15.550
Yeah.

17:15.586 --> 17:16.619
I needed a second.

17:16.655 --> 17:19.034
I'm sure he thinks we're
Plotting against him.

17:19.068 --> 17:20.344
Who cares.

17:20.378 --> 17:23.586
Just because you cry and you
Were blindsided in the game does.

17:23.619 --> 17:27.310
Not mean I should automatically
Feel sad for you because you did.

17:27.344 --> 17:30.689
Not feel sad for me when you
Voted for me.

17:30.724 --> 17:31.620
I don't need him.

17:31.655 --> 17:33.758
He's going through the
Remorse process.

17:33.793 --> 17:34.413
He is.

17:34.448 --> 17:35.458
I don't want to be here.

17:35.482 --> 17:36.931
But I am.

17:36.965 --> 17:40.793
It's, like, voluntary torture.

17:40.827 --> 17:44.103
I'm stuck on an island with two
People that are pissed at me.

17:44.137 --> 17:46.379
I've got nothing but myself.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.034
It's really hard being out here.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.241
A lot of my fears started to
Come out.

17:51.275 --> 17:54.896
I've got a fear of failure.

17:54.931 --> 17:57.344
Of, need for approval.

17:57.379 --> 17:59.827
Like, just trying to be perfect.

17:59.862 --> 18:01.379
This perfectionist.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.862
And, you know, all those fears
Happened.

18:04.896 --> 18:06.689
I failed.

18:06.724 --> 18:10.827
Like, it got me voted out, this
Ideal of playing a perfect game.

18:10.862 --> 18:13.931
Is completely shot.

18:13.965 --> 18:15.827
So coming to terms with that.

18:15.862 --> 18:21.137
Maybe that's a part of this
Journey, too.

18:21.172 --> 18:23.137
My god.

18:23.172 --> 18:25.000
My god.

18:25.034 --> 18:26.275
Good job!

18:26.310 --> 18:28.620
That's a win for the day.

18:28.655 --> 18:31.068
Yeah, congratulations.

18:31.103 --> 18:34.862
I like chris today better
Than chris yesterday, right?

18:34.896 --> 18:35.793
Yeah.

18:35.827 --> 18:39.034
The real test to adaptation
Is out here.

18:39.068 --> 18:43.482
I'm out here to get as far as I
Possibly can despite all the.

18:43.517 --> 18:46.103
Obstacles that are being thrown
At me right now.

18:46.137 --> 18:47.551
Thank you for lunch.

18:47.586 --> 18:48.517
This is amazing.

18:48.551 --> 18:49.655
We're so hungry.

18:49.689 --> 18:50.448
Tasty.

18:50.482 --> 18:52.965
Thank you for being a Fisherman.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.068
I don't know what this island
Has in store yet.

18:55.103 --> 18:57.068
Are we on a tribe?

18:57.103 --> 18:59.103
Are we going against each other?

18:59.137 --> 19:00.379
Time will tell.

19:00.413 --> 19:03.551
So I'm just going to look out
For them as best I can and hope.

19:03.586 --> 19:05.034
They look out for me.

19:05.068 --> 19:06.655
We're kind of a strange family
Out here.

19:06.689 --> 19:07.965
It's a lizard.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.379
Dude, get that away from me.

19:09.413 --> 19:11.103
Watch out, it's coming to get
You.

19:11.137 --> 19:11.793
I swear to god, dude.

19:11.827 --> 19:13.793
I will drop-kick you.

19:13.827 --> 19:18.103
That is lame, freaking lame.

19:34.172 --> 19:36.137
In the morning, chickens are
Gone.

19:36.172 --> 19:38.217
To me it seems like there's only
One person here to doesn't want.

19:38.241 --> 19:40.862
To see the chicken, wendy.

19:40.896 --> 19:44.896
It's possible wendy let the
Chickens go.

19:44.931 --> 19:46.793
She's like, "They're going to
Kill them."

19:46.827 --> 19:54.827
I'm going to let them go.

19:57.379 --> 20:00.137
Chickens, I just think it's a
Soft spot in wendy's heart.

20:00.172 --> 20:03.689
But if I catch one, it's not
Going back in the coop.

20:03.724 --> 20:05.620
It's going under the machete.

20:05.655 --> 20:09.275
It's crazy.

20:09.310 --> 20:14.413
She... Serious?

20:14.448 --> 20:15.206
That's not cool.

20:15.241 --> 20:17.689
That's not cool, chickens!

20:17.724 --> 20:20.068
So what do you guys want to do
Today?

20:20.103 --> 20:22.655
What if we just... let's try.

20:22.689 --> 20:23.172
To catch it.

20:23.206 --> 20:24.137
No!

20:24.172 --> 20:26.724
Well, wendy, you're making ma
This tough.

20:26.758 --> 20:29.896
Please, guys.

20:29.931 --> 20:32.275
That would be worse than me
Going to tribal council.

20:32.310 --> 20:34.586
Girl, you set free breakfast,
Lunch, and dinner.

20:34.620 --> 20:37.448
Like, I'm still 100% all for
Killing the chickens.

20:37.482 --> 20:41.310
I do not care if wendy cries
Herself to sleep at night.

20:41.344 --> 20:44.000
Please, guys, you're my best
Tribe.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.034
You're my tribemates.

20:45.068 --> 20:47.034
She kind of went nuts.

20:47.068 --> 20:51.241
You'd rather get voted out than
See a chicken die?

20:51.275 --> 20:52.000
That's bizarre.

20:52.034 --> 20:53.251
That's not someone you can
Trust.

20:53.275 --> 20:57.862
That's someone you vote out.

21:04.448 --> 21:12.448
Come on in, guys!

21:14.482 --> 21:19.586
Come on in, guys!

21:19.620 --> 21:22.689
All right, shall we
Get to today's immunity.

21:22.724 --> 21:23.000
Challenge?

21:23.034 --> 21:24.206
Yeah!

21:24.241 --> 21:30.310
First things first,
Julia, I got to take it back.

21:30.344 --> 21:32.896
Once again, immunity is back up
For grabs.

21:32.931 --> 21:38.586
And today, two tribes will win
Immunity.

21:38.620 --> 21:40.586
Two tribes will be safe at the.

21:40.620 --> 21:41.034
Vote.

21:41.068 --> 21:42.275
Let's get to it.

21:42.310 --> 21:45.758
For today's challenge, you're
Going to race over a series of.

21:45.793 --> 21:47.551
A-frames while carrying coils of
Rope.

21:47.586 --> 21:51.241
You'll then use that rope to
Pull a heavy crate to the.

21:51.275 --> 21:52.310
Finish.

21:52.344 --> 21:56.551
Use the pieces inside the crate
To solve a puzzle.

21:56.586 --> 22:01.689
First two tribes to solve the
Puzzle, win immunity, safe from.

22:01.724 --> 22:05.586
Tribal council, losers, somebody
Will be the fourth person voted.

22:05.620 --> 22:06.586
Out of this game.

22:06.620 --> 22:09.241
All right, give you a minute to
Strategize.

22:09.275 --> 22:16.482
We'll get started.

22:16.517 --> 22:20.620
All right, day 11, on
"Survivor," rain coming down in

22:20.655 --> 22:21.000

For immunity, survivors ready?

22:24.620 --> 22:26.448
Go!

22:26.482 --> 22:29.758
You gotta get up and over that
A-frame.

22:29.793 --> 22:34.034
It's siply, it's slippery.

22:34.068 --> 22:37.413
Everybody slides down For lesu.

22:37.448 --> 22:40.482
Quickly, erik and gavin are up
For manu.

22:40.517 --> 22:42.172
They pull up victoria.

22:42.206 --> 22:43.517
They're pulling up wendy.

22:43.551 --> 22:44.931
Joe gets up now for kama.

22:44.965 --> 22:46.482
There goes lauren trying to get
Up.

22:46.517 --> 22:48.931
I can't!

22:48.965 --> 22:51.172
It is manu in the Early lead.

22:51.206 --> 22:52.448
Grab the rope, pull.

22:52.482 --> 22:53.896
Yes, yes, you got it.

22:53.931 --> 22:55.758
I got you.

22:55.793 --> 23:00.172
David trying to get Up.

23:00.206 --> 23:01.379
Kama's good.

23:01.413 --> 23:03.517
Lesu falling behind now.

23:03.551 --> 23:05.448
Manu now working on that second
Wall.

It is lawreb first up for lesu.

23:10.241 --> 23:13.344
She uses the rope to pull up
Wentworth.

23:13.379 --> 23:16.103
That rain has made the wall very
Slippery.

23:16.137 --> 23:18.206
Want to help each snrg.

23:18.241 --> 23:21.517
Joe now going to use
Himself as a human ladder.

23:29.586 --> 23:31.931
This is what you do on
"Survivor"!

23:31.965 --> 23:36.344
Working together as a tribe to
Solve a problem.

23:36.379 --> 23:39.206
I can't reach.

23:39.241 --> 23:41.068
Ron on julia's shoulders.

23:41.103 --> 23:43.344
And here comes aubry.

23:43.379 --> 23:45.689
The entire tribe is a human
Ladder.

23:45.724 --> 23:47.482
Good job, aubry!

23:47.517 --> 23:50.827
Everybody struggling

Coils of rope.

24:16.034 --> 24:17.620
Go, go, go!

24:17.655 --> 24:20.310
You're going to use
This now to pull that crate.

24:20.344 --> 24:22.344
Once your rope's together, you
Can start pulling.

24:22.379 --> 24:23.896
One, two, three!

24:23.931 --> 24:25.931
Manu has their rope Together.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.241
Manu starting to pull.

24:27.275 --> 24:29.379
There goes kama now.

24:29.413 --> 24:31.620
Lesu now has their ropes
Together.

24:31.655 --> 24:34.103
They're in on it.

24:34.137 --> 24:39.344
All three tribes fighting for
Immunity on day 11 in "Survivor".

24:39.379 --> 24:41.586
Edge of extinction"!

24:41.620 --> 24:43.586
One, two, three!

24:43.620 --> 24:45.000
Kama's first there.

24:45.034 --> 24:45.827
Manu's there.

24:45.862 --> 24:46.379
You're good!

24:46.413 --> 24:48.655
One, two, three!

24:48.689 --> 24:50.482
Big pull by lesu.

24:50.517 --> 24:52.103
You're good, lesu!

24:52.137 --> 24:56.068
Now you have to start untying
Knots to get that top off.

24:56.103 --> 24:59.551
Then untie knots to get the
Puzzle pieces free.

24:59.586 --> 25:01.448
Great communication from
Cambodia.

25:01.482 --> 25:02.827
Everybody calm and talking.

25:02.862 --> 25:06.172
Manu right on their tail.

25:06.206 --> 25:07.655
Lesu is right behind.

25:07.689 --> 25:09.275
Put them all in.

25:09.310 --> 25:12.379
It will be joe and
Ron on the puzzle for kama.

25:12.413 --> 25:15.034
Erik and aubry on the puzzle for
Manu.

25:15.068 --> 25:17.379
Here comes lesu with their
Puzzle pieces.

25:17.413 --> 25:21.862
And it's going to be wentworth
And david on the puzzle for.

25:21.896 --> 25:22.482
Lesu.

25:22.517 --> 25:24.275
Now you can start solving.

25:24.310 --> 25:26.310
Grab that... ron, grab that
Piece.

25:26.344 --> 25:29.068
It's a slow,
Methodical process as you begin.

25:29.103 --> 25:31.724
To figure out when pieces need
To move where.

25:31.758 --> 25:33.344
There are two dragons.

25:33.379 --> 25:33.965
That's right.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.137
One at a time.

25:35.172 --> 25:37.068
This is where
Communication will be essential.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.379
Right to left.

25:38.413 --> 25:41.586
Up to the make sure
You're making complementary.

25:41.620 --> 25:41.965
Moves.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.482
Yes, joe.

25:43.517 --> 25:46.379
You will know you're
Making progress as you start to.

25:46.413 --> 25:48.172
See these symbols start
Together.

25:48.206 --> 25:51.689
See the open space, the one
On the left?

25:51.724 --> 25:53.206
That has to match iewp.

25:53.241 --> 25:55.724
No, switch those.

25:55.758 --> 25:58.275
Aubry going to swap Out.

25:58.310 --> 26:00.103
Here comes wendy now for manu.

26:00.137 --> 26:01.241
It's erik and wendy.

26:01.275 --> 26:02.827
Good job, guys!

26:02.862 --> 26:05.137
Good job, guys!

26:05.172 --> 26:07.310
Ron and joe have a
Lot of momentum now.

26:07.344 --> 26:11.206
The one on the end of the
Dragon is not correct.

26:11.241 --> 26:14.034
Wendy is coming in
Moving a lot of piece.

26:14.068 --> 26:16.655
David and wentworth still
Studying, trying to figure out.

26:16.689 --> 26:17.379
Which moves to make.

26:17.413 --> 26:18.551
That's right.

26:18.586 --> 26:20.931
The one in your left hand is
Wrong.

26:20.965 --> 26:23.206
Good job, guys.

26:23.241 --> 26:25.034
Maem thinks they have It.

26:25.068 --> 26:27.103
And they do!

26:27.137 --> 26:29.172
Kama wins immunity.

26:29.206 --> 26:30.517
We're looking for one more.

26:30.551 --> 26:31.793
Another one at a time.

26:31.827 --> 26:32.517
One at a time.

26:32.551 --> 26:34.034
Come omanu!

26:34.068 --> 26:36.344
Come on, manu!

26:36.379 --> 26:39.379
It is manu and lesu Now.

26:39.413 --> 26:40.482
Let's go, ma tue.

26:40.517 --> 26:41.827
You got this.

26:41.862 --> 26:44.758
Erik and wendy
Quickly moving pieces down.

26:44.793 --> 26:47.206
They think they were just off a
Little bit.

26:47.241 --> 26:48.448
Yes, yes.

26:48.482 --> 26:50.620
Are you sure on this?

26:50.655 --> 26:52.413
Wentworth quickly Moving.

26:52.448 --> 26:53.034
David moving pieces.

26:53.068 --> 26:54.827
Who will get there first.

26:54.862 --> 26:55.413
Is that right?

26:55.448 --> 26:58.793
Is that right, guys?

26:58.827 --> 26:59.724
Jeff!

26:59.758 --> 27:00.517
Jeff!

27:00.551 --> 27:02.827
Manu thinks they have It.

27:02.862 --> 27:06.517
Manu wins immunity.

27:06.551 --> 27:10.758
Safe from tribal, sending lesu
To tribal council, where the.

27:10.793 --> 27:14.000
Fourth person will be voted out
Of this game.

27:14.034 --> 27:16.206
Good try.

27:16.241 --> 27:22.551
Good work.

27:22.586 --> 27:24.379
Kama, Congratulations.

27:24.413 --> 27:28.275
Immunity is yours.

27:28.310 --> 27:31.965
Kama remains undefeated in
Immunity challenges.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.379
Manu, your first immunity win.

27:36.413 --> 27:38.827
New tribe makeup, same tribe
Name.

27:38.862 --> 27:40.586
Maybe that's the difference.

27:40.620 --> 27:42.379
Kama, manu, grab wur stuff.

27:42.413 --> 27:43.310
Head back to camp.

27:43.344 --> 27:44.034
No tribal council.

27:44.068 --> 27:45.275
Nobody going home.

27:45.310 --> 27:46.034
Thank you, jeff.

27:46.068 --> 27:48.862
Thank you, jeff.

27:48.896 --> 27:51.758
Lesu, first challenge
As a new tribe.

27:51.793 --> 27:53.000
First loss.

27:53.034 --> 27:56.620
See you tonight at tribal where
Somebody will be the fourth.

27:56.655 --> 27:59.827
"Edge of extinction."

27:59.862 --> 28:00.620
Grab your stuff.

28:00.655 --> 28:01.310
Head back to camp.

28:01.344 --> 28:03.586
This tribe is so bad.

28:03.620 --> 28:08.000
We're like the cleveland brown
Tribe.

28:08.034 --> 28:09.827
Like, we can't get anything
Right.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.827
I feel like I'm, honestly, in a
Nightmare.

28:11.862 --> 28:14.482
This is a group of five people
That has been voting together,

28:14.517 --> 28:17.379
And now we're, like, cutting out
One of the family.

28:17.413 --> 28:20.344
It's horrible.

28:45.827 --> 28:51.206
We're not very good at
Challenges.

28:51.241 --> 28:56.517
Lesu proves to be as good at
Losing as manu.

28:56.551 --> 28:59.103
And now we have to cannibalize
Ourselves.

28:59.137 --> 29:00.344
Someone is going home.

29:00.379 --> 29:04.758
On the one hand it was really
Great swapping with all you.

29:04.793 --> 29:05.655
Guys.

29:05.689 --> 29:06.907
But on the other hand, now, here
We are.

29:06.931 --> 29:10.068
This is when it would be nice
To have one common person to.

29:10.103 --> 29:10.620
Vote out.

29:10.655 --> 29:12.517
It would be.

29:12.551 --> 29:13.758
It really sucks.

29:13.793 --> 29:15.665
You build these relationships
And you think they're going to.

29:15.689 --> 29:17.596
Be the relationships that propel
You forward in the game, and.

29:17.620 --> 29:20.965
Then we end up in a position
Where the people we trust the.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.344
Most, we've got to turn on.

29:26.379 --> 29:30.241
Listen, I'm not going to
Write your name down no matter.

29:30.275 --> 29:31.413
What, like...

29:31.448 --> 29:33.965
I'm not going to write your
Name down no matter what.

29:34.000 --> 29:34.448
That's a promise.

29:34.482 --> 29:35.137
Okay.

29:35.172 --> 29:36.724
Iauren has been not eating.

29:36.758 --> 29:38.206
She hasn't eaten in three days.

29:38.241 --> 29:40.896
She threw up what she had eaten
Today, this morning.

29:40.931 --> 29:41.862
I don't know if you know that.

29:41.896 --> 29:43.103
We love lauren.

29:43.137 --> 29:44.137
But she's not eating.

29:44.172 --> 29:45.379
We're not going to be strong.

29:45.413 --> 29:47.700
Wentworth is the person I
Want out of this game for sure,

29:47.724 --> 29:51.965
But the timing just isn't right.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.310
Yeah, 100%.

29:53.344 --> 29:55.448
Within the first three days.

29:55.482 --> 29:59.827
I have no evidence to back this
Up, but I'm 100% convinced that.

29:59.862 --> 30:01.793
Wentworth has a hidden immunity
Idol.

30:01.827 --> 30:03.689
I know wentworth's game.

30:03.724 --> 30:06.310
She always starts looking for
The idol on day one.

30:06.344 --> 30:09.896
And so I think best-case
Scenario tonight is that the.

30:09.931 --> 30:11.275
Vote goes towards lauren.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.275
All in on lauren.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.034
All in on lauren.

30:14.068 --> 30:14.655
Yeah.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.000
What do you think?

30:16.034 --> 30:16.862
I don't know.

30:16.896 --> 30:19.448
I know, I know.

30:19.482 --> 30:21.241
But I want to vote with you.

30:21.275 --> 30:23.068
Yeah, I want to vote with
You, too.

30:23.103 --> 30:25.182
Going into this tribal, I
Feel like my life in this game.

30:25.206 --> 30:26.137
Is the line.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.172
I'm worried they will think I'm
The weakest.

30:28.206 --> 30:29.758
Even though I don't think I am.

30:29.793 --> 30:33.000
I think not eating gives this
Perception of, "That's a."

30:33.034 --> 30:34.655
Reason to vote her out."

30:34.689 --> 30:36.862
I was a collegiate athlete.

30:36.896 --> 30:41.310
I played division one soccer for
Four years and I'm a strong.

30:41.344 --> 30:43.103
Player and I don't think people
Know it.

30:43.137 --> 30:45.034
I think it's more likely that
Wick switches.

30:45.068 --> 30:46.241
I think so, too.

30:46.275 --> 30:50.172
I think rick has the ability
To go to the other tribe...

30:50.206 --> 30:53.862
and schmooze his way in.

30:53.896 --> 30:56.517
I think I have a little bit
Of stability because I have the.

30:56.551 --> 31:01.000
Idol but that's stressful, too,
Because I want to bring the idol.

31:01.034 --> 31:01.689
To the merge.

31:01.724 --> 31:06.068
I think he will be with us.

31:06.103 --> 31:11.034
I think he will be with us, Too.

31:11.068 --> 31:12.206
So what do we think?

31:12.241 --> 31:16.103
I'm writing down what you and
Lauren want to write down?

31:16.137 --> 31:19.655
You and lauren are really Tight.

31:19.689 --> 31:21.551
She needs to start eating,
Right?

31:21.586 --> 31:22.344
I know, I know.

31:22.379 --> 31:24.655
Wardog is in control of this
Vote.

31:24.689 --> 31:26.517
I think he does want to work
With me.

31:26.551 --> 31:33.172
My fear is he could use david
And gavin to vote out lauren

31:33.206 --> 31:36.034
and he might be more
Susceptible to throw us under.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.448
The bus at the merge.

31:37.482 --> 31:41.482
Wardog is really hard to Read.

31:41.517 --> 31:44.655
I think he's trying to play
"Survivor" like poker, so I.

31:44.689 --> 31:46.344
Don't know if he's telling the
Truth.

31:46.379 --> 31:48.620
I know he's not just having a
Conversation with me.

31:48.655 --> 31:50.172
There's no way.

31:50.206 --> 31:51.241
Where's your head at?

31:51.275 --> 31:52.482
I'm torn.

31:52.517 --> 31:57.103
The only thing I would think
Is, like, lauren is not even.

31:57.137 --> 31:57.724
Eating.

31:57.758 --> 31:58.586
She hasn't eaten for days.

31:58.620 --> 32:00.586
I like rick a lot, and so
It's sad.

32:00.620 --> 32:05.896
And I feel like he can easily
Talk himself into anything at.

32:05.931 --> 32:07.103
The merge.

32:07.137 --> 32:09.517
And out of... like, I don't think
He would stay true to us.

32:09.551 --> 32:12.344
No one's brand is more
Loyalty than me.

32:12.379 --> 32:13.862
That's my brand.

32:13.896 --> 32:16.310
So lauren's weak, I'm loyal.

32:16.344 --> 32:17.355
That's just my pitch, man.

32:17.379 --> 32:20.137
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.931
After being able to talk to each
Person individually, it's.

32:22.965 --> 32:25.010
Obvious that I'm in a classic
Swing vote spot, and I love it.

32:25.034 --> 32:27.241
I'm built for this game.

32:27.275 --> 32:30.137
Whether it was being in the
Army, whether it was playing.

32:30.172 --> 32:33.413
Poker, whether now law school,
I'm always thinking, always.

32:33.448 --> 32:36.000
Going through options, never
Closing doors.

32:36.034 --> 32:37.827
And that's what I'm doing now.

32:37.862 --> 32:42.275
I'm going to take 15-20 minutes
Of wardog time to think.

32:42.310 --> 32:45.448
The tribe say tight-knit group
But it's no longer about the.

32:45.482 --> 32:46.068
Tribe now.

32:46.103 --> 32:47.068
It's about wardog.

32:47.103 --> 32:49.034
And I need a dance partner.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.689
Who can get wardog closer to
Winning $1 million.

32:51.724 --> 32:58.586
I will mark day 11, our last
Day together as a happy family.

32:59.689 --> 33:01.241
God, this is awful.

33:01.275 --> 33:03.835
Sometimes you just have to go
With your instinct, go with your.

33:03.862 --> 33:06.010
Different skill sets, your
Tools, blend them all together.

33:06.034 --> 33:08.551
In the blender and see what
Color comes out and that's what

33:08.586 --> 33:10.586
I'm doing right now.

33:50.724 --> 33:53.620
Me a news report about what's
Going on with this tribe?

33:59.034 --> 33:59.896
Expected.

33:59.931 --> 34:02.413
Love in tribal council, but will
It last?

34:02.448 --> 34:08.447
Good evening, I'm rick devens.

34:08.482 --> 34:11.034
"This may be my last report."

34:11.068 --> 34:14.896
What's good right now
About this tribe?

34:14.931 --> 34:16.241
We love each other.

34:16.275 --> 34:17.172
We love each other.

34:17.206 --> 34:18.965
There's a lot of mutual respect.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.034
And that's it.

34:20.068 --> 34:22.585
Everything else is just crap
Right now.

34:22.620 --> 34:25.655
Wardog, literally,
That's it... affection for each.

34:25.688 --> 34:28.379
Other is the only good thing
Happening right now?

34:28.413 --> 34:29.413
And respect.

34:29.447 --> 34:30.206
Two things.

34:30.241 --> 34:31.034
Two things.

34:31.068 --> 34:32.931
And everything else is a mess.

34:32.965 --> 34:36.034
You see in challenges, we're a
Mess.

34:36.068 --> 34:37.241
Our new camp is a mess.

34:37.275 --> 34:38.965
Lauren, what's up
With the new camp?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.931
There's limited amount of Food.

34:40.965 --> 34:42.551
There's limited amount of
Supplies.

34:42.585 --> 34:45.724
And building an entire new
Shelter with only five people is.

34:45.757 --> 34:46.655
Exhausting.

34:46.688 --> 34:47.838
I mean, it was exhausting with
Nine people.

34:47.862 --> 34:49.379
So it's really bad.

34:49.413 --> 34:53.034
Wentworth, there's a
Lot to be said for having played.

34:53.068 --> 34:54.896
Before, some advantages come
With that.

34:54.931 --> 34:57.517
Does that help at all when it's
Raining and you're sleeping in.

34:57.551 --> 34:58.241
The sand?

34:58.275 --> 34:59.689
Or is it the same for everybody?

34:59.724 --> 35:01.034
It's the same for everybody.

35:01.068 --> 35:03.862
I mean, I went through the
Ringer in cambodia.

35:03.896 --> 35:07.034
And then when I'm here with this
Tribe and we're going through it.

35:07.068 --> 35:09.448
Together, I'm instantly put back
There.

35:09.482 --> 35:12.827
I'm going to get emotional just
Thinking about it because it's,

35:12.862 --> 35:15.517
Like... I feel like everything is
Just piling up today.

35:15.551 --> 35:19.344
How so?

35:19.379 --> 35:22.379
We're just so close.

35:22.413 --> 35:25.517
It sounds ridiculous because
We're all strangers.

35:25.551 --> 35:28.034
But... We've been through a lot
Together already, and I just...

35:28.068 --> 35:31.931
Tonight is just really hard.

35:31.965 --> 35:32.827
So...

35:32.862 --> 35:36.379
I'm just a little sad tonight.

35:36.413 --> 35:40.655
Devens are you
Surprised how fast you can form.

35:40.689 --> 35:44.103
A family with people you might
Never even meet in life.

35:44.137 --> 35:44.551
Otherwise?

35:44.586 --> 35:45.655
It is crazy.

35:45.689 --> 35:47.896
We've been out here 11 days, and
I love these people.

35:47.931 --> 35:51.586
Like, even if I was voted out
Tonight, I would love these.

35:51.620 --> 35:52.448
People.

35:52.482 --> 35:54.793
That's not too inspire you to do
That.

35:54.827 --> 35:57.137
But we feel like the whole
World's against us.

35:57.172 --> 35:58.320
We're losing to these two tribes
Who are yelling and cheering.

35:58.344 --> 36:02.724
Each other on, and the only
Thing we have is each other.

36:02.758 --> 36:06.000
Wardog, what is it
About this adventure that even.

36:06.034 --> 36:10.000
On your worst nights, you're
Still smiling?

36:10.034 --> 36:12.620
For me, I feel like this is
The game of games.

36:12.655 --> 36:16.000
And now that I'm actually in ti
Realize how complex the game.

36:16.034 --> 36:18.689
Is... all the relationships, the
Challenges, the duplicity of.

36:18.724 --> 36:19.896
Everything that's going on.

36:19.931 --> 36:22.241
And then there's the actual
Survival part which tests all.

36:22.275 --> 36:25.655
Your skills... your physical,
Your mental, your emotional.

36:25.689 --> 36:26.793
I love it.

36:26.827 --> 36:29.034
I'm in an adventure and it's the
Ultimate competition.

36:29.068 --> 36:31.586
Devens, it's really
Interesting, everybody was.

36:31.620 --> 36:34.482
Smiling at some point while
Wardog was talking.

36:34.517 --> 36:37.758
What were you thinking about as
He was explaining why he's here?

36:37.793 --> 36:42.068
In my regular life, I can be
Complacent, you know.

36:42.103 --> 36:45.172
News is so competitive, and
Everyone wants to move up to the.

36:45.206 --> 36:46.448
Biggest markets.

36:46.482 --> 36:49.551
But there's also, like, fear of
Rejection, not wanting to take.

36:49.586 --> 36:50.793
That risk.

36:50.827 --> 36:53.251
And then you come out here and
It's like you send the biggest.

36:53.275 --> 36:54.379
Risk you could do.

36:54.413 --> 36:57.862
And you're, like, "I don't want
To go home right now."

36:57.896 --> 36:58.689
I'm here to play."

36:58.724 --> 37:00.137
And you prove something to
Yourself.

37:00.172 --> 37:02.551
And you hope you can take that
Home with you.

37:02.586 --> 37:05.793
David, you were
Really open the first time you.

37:05.827 --> 37:10.862
Played about fearing rejection
From the world, if you were even.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.275
Worthy to be on a tribe.

37:12.310 --> 37:13.551
Absolutely.

37:13.586 --> 37:15.838
And what they realize or don't
Realize yet is there are things.

37:15.862 --> 37:18.551
To be found in this experience
That are worth more than the.

37:18.586 --> 37:20.448
Million dollars that's at the
End of it.

37:20.482 --> 37:25.620
My life is way better for this
Experience, judging vuft played.

37:25.655 --> 37:29.172
It once, than it would have been
Had I not played it at all.

37:29.206 --> 37:30.355
I thought I just wanted to play
"Survivor."

37:30.379 --> 37:31.941
I wasn't until I got inside it
That I needed to play it.

37:31.965 --> 37:35.724
And that is why
Everyone of you wants to play.

37:35.758 --> 37:39.103
The stakes are so hard, and
That's why it's so hard and.

37:39.137 --> 37:40.448
Winning is so glorious.

37:40.482 --> 37:44.448
And yet, lauren, the game
Demands that somebody get their.

37:44.482 --> 37:46.689
Torch snuffed moments from now.

37:46.724 --> 37:49.034
Tonight is extremely hard.

37:49.068 --> 37:51.172
We respect each other a lot.

37:51.206 --> 37:52.931
This tribal is not going to be
Ugly.

37:52.965 --> 37:54.655
It's not going to be hateful.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.620
It's not going to be something
That tears another person down.

37:57.655 --> 38:00.931
But there are going to be lines
Drawn because in a five-person.

38:00.965 --> 38:05.965
Tribe, a 3-2 majority can turn
To a 2-3 minority really fast.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.620
Jeff, the whole feeling for
Me is different than the first.

38:08.655 --> 38:09.586
Three tribals.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.172
The first three tribals had a
Reason behind.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.517
There was games manship.

38:13.551 --> 38:16.551
The tribal tonight, if it's not
Me, it's one of my four family.

38:16.586 --> 38:17.793
Members here.

38:17.827 --> 38:21.344
If my torch is snuffed, I have
No hard feelings, and if it's.

38:21.379 --> 38:24.275
One of these four, I hope they
Have no hard feelings against.

38:24.310 --> 38:24.758
Me.

38:24.793 --> 38:26.034
A game is a game.

38:26.068 --> 38:28.586
I have to say this is one of
The most emotional incredible.

38:28.620 --> 38:33.448
Tribal... it is the most
Emotional incredible tribal I've.

38:33.482 --> 38:33.827
Been to.

38:33.862 --> 38:34.482
Tonight?

38:34.517 --> 38:35.206
Yes.

38:35.241 --> 38:36.251
And I've been to a lot of them.

38:36.275 --> 38:38.586
It does feel special in a
Very sad way.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.586
All right, it is time To vote.

38:40.620 --> 38:48.620
David you're up.

38:50.655 --> 38:57.103
David you're up.

38:57.137 --> 39:00.517
You're such a terrific
Person, but not the not eating.

39:00.551 --> 39:08.551
Worries me about you and about
Our chances and challenges.

39:11.137 --> 39:12.931
I'm so sorry.

39:12.965 --> 39:20.965
I hate this vote so much.

39:23.000 --> 39:30.068
I hate this vote so much.

39:33.517 --> 39:41.517
I'll go tally the Votes.

39:46.241 --> 39:48.379
If anybody has a
Hidden immunity idol and you.

39:48.413 --> 39:56.413
Want to play it, now would be
The time to do so.

39:57.758 --> 40:00.034
Okay.

40:00.068 --> 40:04.620
I'll read the votes.

40:04.655 --> 40:09.655
First vote, lauren.

40:09.689 --> 40:10.379
Rick.

40:10.413 --> 40:15.034
One vote lauren, one vote rick.

40:15.068 --> 40:15.896
Lauren.

40:15.931 --> 40:22.620
That's two votes lauren, one
Vote rick.

40:22.655 --> 40:23.862
Rick.

40:23.896 --> 40:29.758
We're tied... two votes lauren,
Two votes rick, one vote left.

40:29.793 --> 40:33.482
Fourth person voted out of
"Survivor Edge of extinction,"

40:33.517 --> 40:36.103
Rick devins.

40:36.137 --> 40:38.551
You need to bring me your torch.

40:38.586 --> 40:40.137
Dude, I'm sorry.

40:40.172 --> 40:44.793
It's all good.

40:44.827 --> 40:52.827
See you later, brother.

40:53.413 --> 40:57.655
Devens, the tribe has Spoken.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.206
I take it all back.

40:59.241 --> 41:00.137
You guys are the worst.

41:00.172 --> 41:01.965
I love you guys.

41:02.000 --> 41:02.586
Go win something.

41:02.620 --> 41:03.344
We love you.

41:03.379 --> 41:11.379
I'm rooting for you.

jeff Stay tuned for scenes.

From our next episode.

42:09.379 --> 42:11.965
Next time on "Survivor."

42:12.000 --> 42:15.413
A diabolical plan.

42:15.448 --> 42:17.275
Wardog say crazy man.

42:17.310 --> 42:18.482
And a ray of light.

42:18.517 --> 42:21.517
Me, you, wendy, get rid of Erik.

42:21.551 --> 42:23.034
I was psyched to hear her say
That.

42:23.068 --> 42:25.206
Can push you over the Edge.

42:25.241 --> 42:25.862
Hurry up.

42:25.896 --> 42:27.034
My god!

42:27.068 --> 42:28.838
We're on the edge of
Extinction, but we're not out of.

42:28.862 --> 42:30.068
The game.

42:30.103 --> 42:32.182
I had already been picturing
Myself eating a burger as I left.

42:32.206 --> 42:35.034
Tribal but holy crap, I'm stim
Stillin this.

42:35.068 --> 42:37.551
I guess I'm going to do my best
To ingratiate myself to these.

42:37.586 --> 42:39.241
People who hate me.

42:39.275 --> 42:41.034
There could be a lot of anger.

42:41.068 --> 42:46.793
Man, you are not in good
Grace here, sweetheart.

42:46.827 --> 42:48.827
This is going to be wild.
