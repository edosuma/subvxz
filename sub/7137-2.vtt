01:46.433 --> 01:49.133
- There are three kinds of laws
which govern us all.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.867
First and foremost
are the laws of God,

01:51.934 --> 01:54.133
followed closely
by the laws of nature,

01:54.200 --> 01:55.900
and running
a distant third,

01:55.967 --> 01:57.800
the laws
created by man.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.867
You see, in order
for man to create a law,

01:59.934 --> 02:02.066
a group of people have to
get together and decide

02:02.133 --> 02:04.233
that they have come up
with "the ultimate truth."

02:04.300 --> 02:07.066
A basic, inherent truth
by which every citizen

02:07.133 --> 02:10.133
must conduct himself
or be punished.

02:10.200 --> 02:11.600
The only problem is,
the group of people

02:11.667 --> 02:13.033
who decides on
"the ultimate truth"

02:13.100 --> 02:15.100
is a bunch
of politicians.

02:15.166 --> 02:16.767
Given the choice,

02:16.834 --> 02:18.600
would you rather be judged
by a whim of the Almighty,

02:18.667 --> 02:20.734
or a vote
by congress?

02:25.266 --> 02:28.233
- Here comes
the dead man.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.667
- Make your move, bro.

02:32.266 --> 02:35.834
- Later, bro,
but I'm keeping an eye on you.

02:35.900 --> 02:38.467
- Truer words have
never been spoke, man.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.533
- What the hell's
that mean?

02:40.600 --> 02:41.934
- Being only that
you got one good eye,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.467
droopy-eyed
motherfucker.

02:44.767 --> 02:45.734
- Cocksucker!

02:45.800 --> 02:47.333
- Get him!
Kill him!

02:47.400 --> 02:49.000
- Kill that motherfucker!

02:49.066 --> 02:51.967
Kill that fucking
brown-ass motherfucker!

03:04.900 --> 03:08.266
- Fascinating,
you in the cafeteria.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.900
- What do you mean?

03:10.967 --> 03:14.767
- Throwing caution
to the wind.

03:16.133 --> 03:18.166
- Think it'll work?

03:18.233 --> 03:19.667
Will I survive?

03:19.734 --> 03:21.767
- I don't know.

03:21.834 --> 03:22.934
- But you gotta know.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.467
You been in Oz,
like, 36 years.

03:26.533 --> 03:27.800
Been through the same shit
that I've been through,

03:27.867 --> 03:29.633
and more.

03:29.700 --> 03:32.767
And I know you
know all the tricks.

03:32.834 --> 03:34.800
- No, no tricks.

03:34.867 --> 03:37.834
- Well, then what?

03:37.900 --> 03:39.767
- I've just
been myself.

03:39.834 --> 03:43.066
Like I said, it's fascinating
the difference in generations.

03:43.133 --> 03:45.367
You young people
growin' up with

03:45.433 --> 03:47.033
so much choice
and possibility.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.934
On the one hand,
that's a marvelous thing.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.800
On the other, so many of you
battle with who you are.

03:52.867 --> 03:55.266
For us,
it was simpler.

03:55.333 --> 03:58.333
There was none of this
"finding yourself" jazz.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.433
You just concentrated
on what you had to do.

04:01.500 --> 04:02.633
You were 18...

04:02.700 --> 04:06.233
19 years old
going off to war.

04:06.300 --> 04:07.633
So that's
who you were.

04:07.700 --> 04:10.800
That's who
we all were.

04:10.867 --> 04:12.266
- So you guys are heroes?

04:12.333 --> 04:14.367
Is what
you're telling me?

04:14.433 --> 04:16.333
You guys are he-men?

04:16.400 --> 04:20.633
- Lord, no,
we were scared to death.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.300
But when the landing boats
carried you to shore

04:22.367 --> 04:25.300
and the metal doors came down,
you charged the beach,

04:25.367 --> 04:28.166
took the blow,
that's just how it was.

04:28.233 --> 04:31.633
It had to be done.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.834
I've faced
many hurdles and...

04:33.900 --> 04:36.300
Moments of great fear
in my life.

04:36.367 --> 04:39.500
But coming from an age
when men took the blow,

04:39.567 --> 04:43.934
I've always felt comfortable
in my own skin.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.400
- Sounds good.

04:45.467 --> 04:47.633
That's good.

04:50.567 --> 04:51.967
- Oh, raider baby.

04:52.033 --> 04:54.066
Whoo, mmm.

04:57.100 --> 05:00.900
Oh, shit.
Oh, hoochie mama.

05:14.734 --> 05:17.600
- I want you
to stab me.

05:17.667 --> 05:18.967
- What?

05:19.033 --> 05:21.033
- I want you
to shank me.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.834
I won't retaliate.

05:23.900 --> 05:26.000
- Yeah, are you gonna
let me kill you?

05:26.066 --> 05:29.266
- Not kill,
stab in the shoulder.

05:29.333 --> 05:32.667
Proposition's this...

05:32.734 --> 05:33.934
I'll give you
a free shot at me,

05:34.033 --> 05:37.600
and in return,
I don't die.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.967
- What the fuck
you talking about?

05:40.033 --> 05:43.233
- I'm willing to
take the blow.

05:43.300 --> 05:46.467
Wouldn't it be satisfying
just to stick me?

05:46.533 --> 05:49.500
- Immensely
fucking satisfying.

05:49.567 --> 05:53.834
- Okay, make sure you hold up
your part of the bargain.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.400
I want witnesses.

05:57.467 --> 06:00.166
I want a lot of them.

06:00.233 --> 06:02.100
- I get this.

06:02.166 --> 06:04.633
You let me take
a swipe at you,

06:04.700 --> 06:08.667
and the hacks throw me in
Solitary for the next 10 years.

06:08.734 --> 06:09.900
- No.

06:09.967 --> 06:12.800
We do it when
the guards aren't around.

06:12.867 --> 06:15.734
You'll control that.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.233
I just want
the inmates to see,

06:18.300 --> 06:20.467
so in case you do
decide to kill me,

06:20.533 --> 06:25.800
one of the inmates
will go to Glynn,

06:25.867 --> 06:27.667
give you up.

06:27.734 --> 06:30.200
You end up
on death row.

06:34.033 --> 06:36.500
- Deal.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.667
What that loco motherfucker
don't know

06:42.734 --> 06:44.767
is I am
gonna kill him.

06:44.834 --> 06:47.200
After he's down,
I slip the shank in his hand,

06:47.266 --> 06:49.767
and it's self-defense.

06:50.900 --> 06:52.433
- Fuck.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.700
- What's the matter?

06:54.767 --> 06:56.734
- My sister's dead,

06:56.800 --> 07:00.200
and ever since I heard the news
I've felt nothing.

07:00.266 --> 07:03.934
And now you tell me
you're going to kill Alvarez,

07:04.000 --> 07:08.266
and I feel this little
charge in my belly.

07:09.266 --> 07:11.834
Jesus, what
the hell is that?

07:11.900 --> 07:13.066
- It's nothing.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.700
- My little sister
worshipped me.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.700
You can't
kill Alvarez.

07:20.767 --> 07:22.066
- What?!

07:22.133 --> 07:23.867
- I haven't shed a tear
for a sister

07:23.934 --> 07:25.467
who thought
that much of me.

07:25.533 --> 07:27.100
And at
the same time,

07:27.166 --> 07:29.500
this Alvarez thing
is revving me up.

07:29.567 --> 07:31.633
It's not right,
there's something wrong.

07:31.700 --> 07:34.633
And out of respect
for Annette,

07:34.700 --> 07:36.367
I gotta take
a look at that.

07:36.433 --> 07:38.333
We both do.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.133
- What's happening is you're
on a delayed reaction.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.734
You're in shock.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.033
In a week, you'll be crying
like a baby over your sister.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.300
Thing is,
we don't got a week.

07:46.367 --> 07:48.333
Our best chance
to kill Alvarez is here,

07:48.400 --> 07:49.867
right now.

07:49.934 --> 07:50.967
- Chico.

07:59.633 --> 08:01.400
- You ready?

08:06.533 --> 08:07.767
- Ready.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.500
- Yo!

08:09.567 --> 08:11.166
Yo, my man,
look over here!

08:11.233 --> 08:13.000
Over here!

08:13.066 --> 08:15.367
Guys, over here!
Watch this!

08:15.433 --> 08:17.600
Ready.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.567
- We got a 29 in the gym.

08:50.633 --> 08:53.133
We got a 29 in the gym.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.400
Hang on,
hang on, hang on.

08:55.467 --> 08:58.100
Repeat, I have a 29
in the gym.

08:58.166 --> 08:59.700
This is 14.

09:04.266 --> 09:06.867
- There you are,
you look right smart.

09:06.934 --> 09:09.600
- I wish they'd let you
come with me to the funeral.

09:09.667 --> 09:13.333
- Me, too, but I wasn't really
a relative or nothing.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.834
- I still can't
believe this, man.

09:15.900 --> 09:18.867
How can my moms be dead?

09:18.934 --> 09:21.233
- I remember when
I first met your mother.

09:21.300 --> 09:24.266
We were none of us
no more than 14.

09:25.934 --> 09:28.700
I was with your dad,
doing some kind of nonsense

09:28.767 --> 09:31.367
when all of a sudden,

09:31.433 --> 09:34.800
I saw her coming across
Friedmont Street.

09:34.867 --> 09:39.233
Mmm, she had
the sweetest pair of eyes.

09:40.633 --> 09:42.667
Your dad
didn't even notice her

09:42.734 --> 09:45.333
until I tapped him
on the shoulder.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.300
He looked at her,
she looked at him,

09:48.367 --> 09:49.800
and that was that.

09:49.867 --> 09:52.867
They got married;
they had you.

09:52.934 --> 09:57.500
- Burr, you always loved
my moms, didn't you?

09:57.567 --> 09:59.233
- Of course.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.533
- No, no.

10:02.600 --> 10:06.700
No, I mean,
you loved  her.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.100
- I loved
your father, too.

10:11.166 --> 10:15.033
But life works out
the way life works out.

10:15.734 --> 10:19.266
I want you to put that
on her grave for me.

10:20.734 --> 10:23.500
- What is this?

10:23.567 --> 10:26.300
- My high school
graduation ring.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.633
- Yo, Busmalis.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.700
Any word from your fiancÃ©e
since she left you at the altar?

10:37.767 --> 10:40.667
- Ah, yeah sure, like,
"Don't try and track me down,

10:40.734 --> 10:42.600
I done skipped town."

10:42.667 --> 10:44.166
- No, I watched
the show yesterday.

10:44.233 --> 10:45.934
Norma's still working on
"Miss Sally,"

10:46.000 --> 10:47.133
her name's still
in the credits.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.800
- Those are repeats.

10:48.867 --> 10:51.033
In fact, I read
in the newspaper

10:51.100 --> 10:53.967
they may even cancel
"Miss Sally's Schoolyard."

10:54.033 --> 10:55.500
- What?

10:55.567 --> 10:58.033
- Jeez, you are a sad fuck,
no wonder she ditched you.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.834
- What the hell
do you know about it?

10:59.900 --> 11:01.600
- Know about what,
motherfucker, what?

11:01.667 --> 11:03.467
- Loss, being left.

11:03.533 --> 11:06.934
You have no damn idea,
you stupid fool.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.834
all: Ooh!

11:20.700 --> 11:23.867
- Hey, I appreciate
your sticking up for me,

11:23.934 --> 11:25.600
but you're gonna
get your butt whupped.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.567
- Okay,
whatever you say.

11:27.633 --> 11:28.667
- What's eating you?

11:28.734 --> 11:30.967
- My son came
to see me today.

11:31.033 --> 11:34.734
Alex Jr.'s condition
has gotten worse.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.567
He's developed
nonlymphocytic leukemia.

11:37.633 --> 11:41.133
- Oh, Bob,
that's terrible.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.967
- He's in desperate need
of a bone marrow transplant.

11:45.033 --> 11:46.767
- They need you
to be the donor?

11:46.834 --> 11:49.300
- No, I'm no good to him,
nobody in our family is.

11:49.367 --> 11:52.066
Alex Jr.'s mother
is of West Indian

11:52.133 --> 11:55.400
and Guatemalan descent.

11:55.467 --> 11:58.633
My grandson's unique
mixed-race heritage makes

11:58.700 --> 12:03.200
for the most beautiful skin
you'll ever lay eyes on.

12:03.266 --> 12:05.867
It also makes finding
a suitable donor

12:05.934 --> 12:08.233
extremely difficult.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.467
- But there's gotta be
a match out there somewhere.

12:10.533 --> 12:11.800
- Oh, sure, somewhere.

12:11.867 --> 12:13.967
But there's a great
shortage of donors,

12:14.033 --> 12:17.734
and an even greater shortage
of minority donors.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.166
- Then doctors should
get the word out,

12:20.233 --> 12:21.433
sign more people up.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.266
-  I wish it
were that easy.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.533
But like with
so many other diseases,

12:25.600 --> 12:28.934
there's never enough
money to go around.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.433
- Where you going?

12:31.500 --> 12:35.767
- To see Dr. Nathan.
I don't feel so hot.

12:39.867 --> 12:42.166
- The umbilical cord,
like bone marrow,

12:42.233 --> 12:44.900
contains cells capable
of fighting leukemia.

12:44.967 --> 12:47.533
But unfortunately,
that procedure's still

12:47.600 --> 12:49.400
very much in
the experimental stages.

12:49.467 --> 12:50.867
Oh, thanks.

12:50.934 --> 12:52.133
Here you go.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.233
Take these,
you'll be fine.

12:56.467 --> 12:58.734
I know how helpless
you feel, Bob.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.133
I hear a story
like your grandson's

13:01.200 --> 13:02.667
and it
frustrates me, too.

13:02.734 --> 13:06.100
My Latina heritage kicks in
and starts kicking me

13:06.166 --> 13:07.333
for being so American.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.166
- I don't follow.

13:09.233 --> 13:11.433
- In Central America,
South America,

13:11.500 --> 13:13.867
there's wide belief that
certain herbal medicines

13:13.934 --> 13:16.266
hold great promise
in regards to treating cancer

13:16.333 --> 13:17.633
and other diseases.

13:17.700 --> 13:20.033
- But you think that's
a bunch of baloney?

13:20.100 --> 13:22.500
- Like I said,

13:22.567 --> 13:25.266
the A.M.A.
got the best of me.

13:29.166 --> 13:31.700
- Pamphlets, magazines,
medical journals,

13:31.767 --> 13:33.800
anything to do
with herbal medicine,

13:33.867 --> 13:36.033
particularly material
dealing with research

13:36.100 --> 13:38.033
and treatment of leukemia.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.200
- Lights out!

14:40.834 --> 14:43.200
- I've found
the cure for cancer.

14:43.266 --> 14:44.266
- You what?

14:44.333 --> 14:46.100
- Lapacho.

14:46.166 --> 14:47.667
- Lapa-who?

14:47.734 --> 14:51.900
- An herb from
the rain forests of Paraguay.

14:51.967 --> 14:55.066
Some doctors claim they've
effectively used the herb

14:55.133 --> 14:58.600
to treat cancer,
leukemia in particular.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.734
- Wow, this is
great news.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.166
- No, no, no, it's not,
it's maddening.

15:03.233 --> 15:04.633
- Maddening?

15:04.700 --> 15:07.166
- Lapacho is
an evergreen.

15:07.233 --> 15:10.033
There are more than
100 species of lapacho trees.

15:10.100 --> 15:14.233
Identifying which ones
yield the necessary

15:14.300 --> 15:18.000
medicinal material
is very expensive.

15:18.066 --> 15:19.600
- Oh, here we go again.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.333
Always money,
money, money.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.233
Only way for a man
to get ahead in the world

15:23.300 --> 15:25.233
is to be some kind of
goddamn millionaire.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.800
- I'll raise the cash.

15:27.867 --> 15:29.433
- In Oz?
How?

15:29.500 --> 15:32.266
- I don't know,
but I'll find a way.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.633
- Good luck.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.433
- Here are some laws,

15:38.500 --> 15:40.400
real laws currently
on the books,

15:40.467 --> 15:42.834
laws that if you broke,
you'd end up in jail.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.166
The state of
Rhode Island says

15:45.233 --> 15:48.266
it's illegal to throw
pickle juice on a trolley.

15:48.333 --> 15:51.467
In the state of Washington,
all lollipops are banned.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.734
Down in Indiana,
baths may not be taken

15:54.800 --> 15:57.867
between the months of
October and March.

15:57.934 --> 15:59.800
Over in San Francisco,

15:59.867 --> 16:02.100
you cannot pick up
and throw used confetti.

16:02.166 --> 16:04.166
And in North Carolina,

16:04.233 --> 16:06.734
the law forbids
dogs and cats to fight.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.600
But you see, that goes
against the laws of nature.

16:09.667 --> 16:12.233
Dogs and cats
are born enemies.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.433
- Okay, all done,
wheel him into the ward.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.834
- Dr. Nathan, we've got
trauma to the head.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.266
- What happened?

16:17.333 --> 16:18.433
- I was releasing
this joker from the Hole,

16:18.500 --> 16:19.767
and he took
a swing at me.

16:19.834 --> 16:21.000
- I ain't no pussy.

16:21.066 --> 16:22.300
- Yeah, so I gave him
one of these.

16:22.367 --> 16:23.967
- Faggot!
- Prep him for sutures!

16:24.033 --> 16:26.066
Doesn't look too bad, you'll
need a couple of stitches.

16:26.133 --> 16:27.166
What's your name?

16:27.233 --> 16:28.800
- Stanton,
Henry Stanton,

16:28.867 --> 16:30.500
and I don't love you.

16:30.567 --> 16:32.400
- What?
- Glynn sent me to the Hole

16:32.467 --> 16:33.934
'cause he said I was obsessed
with your tits,

16:34.000 --> 16:35.433
but I'm not.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.367
You gotta tell the Warden
I'm an innocent man.

16:37.433 --> 16:39.500
You gotta--get the fuck--

16:39.567 --> 16:41.367
You gotta tell the Warden
I'm an innocent man!

16:41.433 --> 16:43.433
- Get off me!
- Hey, hey!

16:43.500 --> 16:44.600
- Ow!

16:44.667 --> 16:46.300
- You all right?

16:46.367 --> 16:47.900
- Yeah, I was
handling this, Ryan.

16:47.967 --> 16:49.200
- Yeah, well,
it didn't look like it.

16:49.266 --> 16:50.200
- Well, I don't
need you in my life!

16:50.266 --> 16:51.400
- Okay.

16:51.467 --> 16:52.767
- Just get the fuck
away from me!

16:52.834 --> 16:54.166
- Okay!
- Keep moving, O'Reily!

16:54.233 --> 16:56.367
- I need those sutures!
Where the fuck are they?

16:56.433 --> 16:58.667
I need another pair of gloves,
and prep him for sutures.

16:58.734 --> 17:00.934
Can you hold him, please?

17:03.066 --> 17:04.867
- There you go, Enrique.

17:04.934 --> 17:08.066
- Yo, Ryan, save me
some extra beets?

17:08.133 --> 17:10.567
- All of a sudden you got quite
the appetite there, Marty.

17:10.633 --> 17:12.700
- Oh, yeah, I never
seem to get enough,

17:12.767 --> 17:14.133
which is why
we gotta talk.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.400
- About what?

17:15.467 --> 17:16.967
- My compensation
for lying to Glynn.

17:17.033 --> 17:18.667
- Wait, shut the fuck up!

17:18.734 --> 17:20.000
- That's what
I'm talking about.

17:20.066 --> 17:21.333
For me to keep
my lips zipped,

17:21.400 --> 17:22.867
you gotta come up
with a lot more moola.

17:22.934 --> 17:25.900
- Come on, Marty, man,
we had a deal, right?

17:25.967 --> 17:27.500
- Well, I'm renegotiating.

17:27.567 --> 17:29.700
- All right,
I'll tell you what.

17:29.767 --> 17:33.100
What do you say we meet
in the library at 4:00?

17:33.166 --> 17:35.633
- Bring your checkbook.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.233
- I had Montgomery lie
to the Warden and say

17:45.300 --> 17:47.066
that Henry Stanton
killed Patrick Keenan,

17:47.133 --> 17:48.633
and Montgomery says
if I don't pay more,

17:48.700 --> 17:50.266
he's gonna rat me out.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.333
- If he does, Glynn will know
for sure that you killed Keenan.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.333
He'll fry your ass.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.533
- Which is why
I'm not gonna make

17:56.600 --> 17:58.734
my 4:00 appointment
with Montgomery.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.667
- No?

18:00.734 --> 18:04.400
- No, I'll have Stanton
show up instead.

18:12.033 --> 18:14.300
Yo, Stanton.

18:14.367 --> 18:16.333
- O'Reily, I ain't
bothering your brother

18:16.400 --> 18:18.500
or Nathan or nobody.

18:18.567 --> 18:20.000
So just leave me alone.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.333
- Look,
I know that, man.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.867
You know,
I think you and me,

18:22.934 --> 18:24.633
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.734
But I just want to let you know
that I got no beef with you.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.133
- That's good.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.033
- In fact, actually,
you and me,

18:30.100 --> 18:31.533
we got something
in common.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.000
We're both suspects in
the murder of Patrick Keenan.

18:34.066 --> 18:35.834
- I know.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.934
- You know, we both
got eyewitnesses

18:38.000 --> 18:39.467
who say they
saw us do the deed.

18:39.533 --> 18:41.300
And I don't know
who's accusing me,

18:41.367 --> 18:42.867
but as luck
would have it,

18:42.934 --> 18:44.000
I found out
who's lying about you.

18:44.066 --> 18:45.633
- Who?

18:45.700 --> 18:47.567
- Well, you know, I'm hesitant
to tell you there, Henry,

18:47.633 --> 18:49.066
for fear that you're
gonna do something crazy.

18:49.133 --> 18:51.567
- Motherfucker lies about me,
that does make me crazy.

18:51.633 --> 18:53.800
- Well, see then,
I'm not gonna tell you, man.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.333
- Tell me, God damn it.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.934
- No, I don't think I should.
- Tell me!

18:57.000 --> 18:59.266
Please tell me.
- I'm not gonna tell you.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.166
- Tell me! Tell me!
- I'm not gonna fucking--

19:01.233 --> 19:02.834
I'm not gonna
fucking tell you!

19:02.900 --> 19:04.333
- God damn it please,
tell me.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.500
- Martin Montgomery.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.200
- Martin Montgomery?

19:12.266 --> 19:16.867
I'm gonna kill
that fucking cunt!

19:21.667 --> 19:23.867
I guess you won't
be talking no more,

19:23.934 --> 19:26.767
will you, motherfucker?
- Get off him!

19:26.834 --> 19:28.600
Oh, shit!

19:28.667 --> 19:31.834
I got him,
you got a neck wound!

19:32.633 --> 19:34.467
Neck wound!

19:35.700 --> 19:37.467
- Stanton's in Solitary.

19:37.533 --> 19:40.500
Montgomery's at Benchley
Memorial in critical condition.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.867
People at the gym
say they overheard

19:47.934 --> 19:50.400
you telling Stanton that
Montgomery squealed on him.

19:50.467 --> 19:53.700
- Oh, no, Stanton asked me
if I knew anything about it,

19:53.767 --> 19:56.500
and I told him I just
heard a rumor, that's all.

19:59.066 --> 20:02.433
- We found this in
Montgomery's footlocker.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.533
- What's that?

20:04.600 --> 20:06.200
- Keenan's shamrock.

20:06.266 --> 20:08.433
- Oh, yeah, right,
I recognize that now.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.000
What the fuck was
Montgomery doing with it?

20:11.066 --> 20:13.133
- I was hoping maybe
you could tell me.

20:13.200 --> 20:16.033
- Oh, no, jeez,
Warden, I don't know.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.900
- Suzanne Fitzgerald,
the '60s radical

20:19.967 --> 20:22.033
who turned herself in
to federal authorities

20:22.100 --> 20:24.066
after 32 years on the run,
was released today

20:24.133 --> 20:26.066
from the Parker
Correctional Facility for women.

20:26.133 --> 20:27.600
- No fucking way.

20:27.667 --> 20:29.100
- Governor James Devlin
has commuted Fitzgerald's

20:29.166 --> 20:31.000
sentence to two years
of community service.

20:31.066 --> 20:32.567
- Yes!

20:32.633 --> 20:34.166
- The governor's decision,
while widely expected,

20:34.233 --> 20:35.367
remains controversial.

20:35.433 --> 20:36.967
- Yes!

20:37.033 --> 20:38.300
Come on, Cyril.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.233
- We're so glad you decided

20:40.300 --> 20:41.834
to do your
community service in Oz.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.967
- And the idea of starting
a performing arts program

20:44.033 --> 20:45.467
is great.

20:45.533 --> 20:46.800
- Oh, thank you.

20:46.867 --> 20:49.734
I taught music
for 20 years in St. Albans.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.600
And when I heard
that you didn't have

20:51.667 --> 20:53.600
any kind of arts
education program here,

20:53.667 --> 20:55.600
it seemed like
a good fit.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.100
- But you know
the hardest part

20:57.166 --> 20:59.200
is gonna be convincing
these guys to sign up.

20:59.266 --> 21:00.967
- You know, I don't know
about that, Pete.

21:01.033 --> 21:02.767
I think they'll sign up
out of the novelty of it,

21:02.834 --> 21:05.233
but the tough thing will be
getting them to stick with it.

21:05.300 --> 21:07.400
- Well, if I could
motivate 10-year-olds,

21:07.467 --> 21:09.433
I think I can handle
your prisoners.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.700
- So what do you
need to get started?

21:11.767 --> 21:14.233
- Well, I would love to see
where I'm gonna work.

21:14.300 --> 21:16.100
- The stage is over
in the cafeteria.

21:16.166 --> 21:17.433
I'll take you right over.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.767
- Oh, and then
I'd like to see my son.

21:18.834 --> 21:20.333
- Oh, sure.

21:27.266 --> 21:29.500
- Psst.

21:29.567 --> 21:31.100
- Ryan!

21:31.166 --> 21:32.367
- Hey.

21:32.433 --> 21:33.867
Oh, man.

21:33.934 --> 21:36.467
Oh, Christ, I thought
I'd lost you forever.

21:36.533 --> 21:39.233
- Oh, no, baby,
you're stuck with me.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.667
- I know he's not your son,
and he's only my half-brother,

21:43.734 --> 21:46.100
but I kind of want
you to meet Cyril.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.567
- Oh, yeah,
I'd love to.

21:47.633 --> 21:48.667
- Yeah? Okay.
Hey, Cyril?

21:48.734 --> 21:50.033
Cyril?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.266
- Hello.

21:53.333 --> 21:54.333
- Hello.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.633
- I made this for you.

21:55.700 --> 21:58.767
- Oh, thank you,
it's so  sweet.

21:58.834 --> 22:01.066
It's beautiful.

22:01.133 --> 22:03.433
Can I give you
a hug and kiss?

22:03.500 --> 22:04.600
- Sure.

22:04.667 --> 22:05.800
- Okay.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.500
So, are you two gonna
be my first pupils?

22:14.567 --> 22:16.533
- Oh, jeez, you know,
Mom, I can't sing.

22:16.600 --> 22:17.533
- Me, neither.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.867
- You can't?

22:18.934 --> 22:21.567
Oh, guess you take
after your father.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.900
That man had
the voice of a warthog.

22:23.967 --> 22:26.033
- She's funny, right?

22:26.100 --> 22:27.200
- She's funny.

22:27.266 --> 22:29.233
- I'm glad you think so.

22:29.300 --> 22:31.567
Well, will you have some
of your friends sign up?

22:31.633 --> 22:34.000
- Our friends?
- Uh-huh.

22:34.066 --> 22:35.834
- Oh, yeah, of course.

22:35.900 --> 22:37.967
- All right, all right,
I'll do it.

22:38.033 --> 22:40.333
In fact, I've been told
I have a pretty good voice.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.400
- Yeah?

22:41.467 --> 22:42.767
- Yeah, in high school,

22:42.834 --> 22:44.300
I had the lead in
"The Pirates of Penzance."

22:44.367 --> 22:46.800
âª I am the very model of
the modern major general âª

22:46.867 --> 22:48.266
âª I have information... âª

22:48.333 --> 22:49.700
- As far as
my mother's concerned,

22:49.767 --> 22:51.700
you never sang a note,
you got it?

22:51.767 --> 22:53.000
- Okay, not a problem.

22:53.066 --> 22:54.233
- Okay.

22:56.467 --> 22:58.367
- Hey, O'Reily,
your mama's looking fine.

22:58.433 --> 23:00.400
Does she fuck
younger guys?

23:00.467 --> 23:02.000
- What was that, Hoyt?
What the fuck did you say?

23:02.066 --> 23:04.000
Fuck you, bitch!
I'm gonna kill you!

23:04.066 --> 23:05.834
Come on, man.

23:05.900 --> 23:08.033
- Get the fuck away,
you cocksucker!

23:08.100 --> 23:11.333
- Bring it, Hoyt!
Bring it!

23:12.300 --> 23:14.266
- Slowly,
slowly roll up.

23:14.333 --> 23:17.333
Roll up, wait,
slowly, slowly, slowly.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.700
Wait, Matt,
hold on.

23:18.767 --> 23:22.967
Okay, relax your jaw,
relax your shoulders.

23:23.033 --> 23:27.433
both: âª Ah ah ah âª

23:33.233 --> 23:34.767
Relax your arms.

23:34.834 --> 23:38.967
- âª Ah ah ah âª

23:40.934 --> 23:43.266
- We gotta talk.

23:43.333 --> 23:44.900
- I'm in the middle
of a class.

23:44.967 --> 23:47.033
- Oh, that's okay,
I've got work to do.

23:47.100 --> 23:48.667
- Well, I'll
see you Thursday?

23:48.734 --> 23:50.367
- Um...

23:50.433 --> 23:53.333
Definitely.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.533
- Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.900
- What?

23:55.967 --> 23:57.533
- Quit?
- I want you to quit.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.100
- On my first day?

23:59.166 --> 24:01.934
- I've ticked off a lot of
the assholes in this place.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.533
Okay, and I don't want
to put you in any jeopardy.

24:04.600 --> 24:05.800
- Jeopardy?

24:05.867 --> 24:06.867
- Yeah.

24:06.934 --> 24:08.567
- There's a C.O.
standing nearby.

24:08.633 --> 24:10.533
- Yeah, well, trust me,
the hacks aren't that reliable.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.066
- I'm not worried.

24:12.133 --> 24:13.066
- Yeah, but I am.

24:13.133 --> 24:14.800
- Well, that's sweet.

24:14.867 --> 24:16.934
- Look, I'm not
being sweet, okay?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.800
Christ, you
could get hurt.

24:19.867 --> 24:22.233
- Ryan, I'm a big girl
and I made my choice.

24:22.300 --> 24:26.166
Look, this is where I'm needed,
this is where I belong.

24:26.233 --> 24:30.100
Nothing you can say is
gonna make me change my mind.

24:30.166 --> 24:33.166
- Hey, O'Reily,
you working today?

24:33.233 --> 24:35.333
- Go.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.166
- Yeah, but...

24:37.233 --> 24:38.400
- Go.

24:38.467 --> 24:39.600
- Move your
fucking ass, O'Reily.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.633
- Dave, you're back.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.033
- Yeah.

25:13.100 --> 25:14.800
- How are you?

25:14.867 --> 25:16.367
- All right.

25:16.433 --> 25:19.633
- Look, I meant to get
over to the hospital, but...

25:19.700 --> 25:21.066
- That's okay.

25:21.133 --> 25:23.500
- How are you?

25:23.567 --> 25:26.200
Oh, I already asked that,
didn't I?

25:26.266 --> 25:29.533
But you're good,
though, huh?

25:29.600 --> 25:31.767
- I'm working.

25:31.834 --> 25:34.867
- So, you're
staying at Oz?

25:34.934 --> 25:37.367
- I'm not sure.

25:37.433 --> 25:40.533
Warden's got me
stationed here,

25:40.600 --> 25:43.433
I'm gonna have to think
about my next move.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.033
- I feel fucking terrible
that this happened.

25:46.100 --> 25:48.367
- Say, you never did find out
who cut me, did you?

25:48.433 --> 25:49.700
- No.

25:49.767 --> 25:54.867
- Truthfully, I think
that's why I'm here.

25:54.934 --> 25:57.233
I want to know.

25:57.300 --> 25:59.633
I fucking want to know.

25:59.700 --> 26:03.133
I'd fucking hurt the guy,
Tim, I'm serious.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.734
I'd hurt him for keeps.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.500
- Your injury was the result
of someone not wanting you

26:09.567 --> 26:12.033
to play in that
final basketball game.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.800
- But how?

26:13.867 --> 26:16.700
- Well, after we decided
not to play,

26:16.767 --> 26:21.934
I told Morales that
you were gonna play.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.967
- Oh.

26:24.033 --> 26:26.700
- I'm so goddamned sorry.

26:29.066 --> 26:31.333
- I'll buzz you in.

26:46.734 --> 26:50.867
Goddamn,
motherfucking thing!

27:14.600 --> 27:16.667
- Tim, the warden
wanted me to tell you

27:16.734 --> 27:18.133
special staff
meeting at 11:00.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.700
- Is there an emergency?

27:19.767 --> 27:22.000
- Oh, Governor Devlin's coming,
got some kind of announcement.

27:22.066 --> 27:23.233
- Can't wait.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.300
- 11:00 on the dot,
don't be late!

27:25.367 --> 27:27.066
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:27.133 --> 27:29.266
- And even though I think
Commissioner Douglas

27:29.333 --> 27:31.033
does an outstanding job,

27:31.100 --> 27:35.200
we've had an ongoing
lack of communication

27:35.266 --> 27:40.700
between my office and you people
here in the trenches.

27:40.767 --> 27:42.400
- We want to open the lines
of dialogue--

27:42.467 --> 27:43.400
- Don't interrupt me,
Martin.

27:43.467 --> 27:44.700
- Yes, sir.

27:44.767 --> 27:48.233
- And so I've decided to
create a liaison between

27:48.300 --> 27:51.400
you and the governor's mansion,
someone you can go to...

27:51.467 --> 27:53.300
- Sorry I'm late.

27:53.367 --> 27:57.333
- Someone experienced
in the field

27:57.400 --> 28:00.800
who you can talk to about
any problems that arise,

28:00.867 --> 28:04.100
who can clear up
any changes

28:04.166 --> 28:06.600
in my administration's
prison policies.

28:06.667 --> 28:12.266
And so I'd like to present
Eleanor O'Connor.

28:14.133 --> 28:16.533
- Thank you governor,
and commissioner.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.433
Well, I'm
the new kid in town,

28:19.500 --> 28:21.734
fresh off the boat
from New York City,

28:21.800 --> 28:24.000
where I worked in a similar
capacity for the mayor.

28:24.066 --> 28:27.567
I won't pretend to grasp
all the needs of Oswald,

28:27.633 --> 28:29.433
or all of your needs.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.266
But I can promise you that
my door will always be unlocked.

28:32.333 --> 28:35.300
I intend to help cut
through the bureaucracy,

28:35.367 --> 28:36.700
the bullshit.

28:36.767 --> 28:38.133
Thank you.

28:42.734 --> 28:46.767
- Okay, get yourselves
some cookies and some lemonade.

28:46.834 --> 28:48.100
Ms. O'Connor--

28:48.166 --> 28:49.533
- Ellie.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.600
- Ellie will be hanging
around to meet and greet.

28:51.667 --> 28:52.734
- I have to go.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.133
- Me, too.

28:57.934 --> 28:59.734
- Ellie, welcome.
I love what you said.

28:59.800 --> 29:03.500
- This is the first smart thing
the governor's done in years.

29:03.567 --> 29:05.934
- I get the impression
Devlin's not well liked.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.767
- Really?
Some of us love him.

29:10.734 --> 29:12.367
- Hello.

29:12.433 --> 29:13.734
- Hello.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.934
- Best of luck.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.734
- Thank you.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.633
- Tim, wait up, I'll head
back to Em City with you.

29:22.500 --> 29:24.433
She seems nice,
genuine.

29:24.500 --> 29:25.900
- Yeah.

29:25.967 --> 29:27.967
- Do me a favor,
don't try to fuck her.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.467
- What?

29:29.533 --> 29:32.033
- Every skirt that crosses
the threshold here, you jump on.

29:32.100 --> 29:33.667
- Oh, that is
simply not true.

29:33.734 --> 29:35.800
- Wittlesey,
Nathan, Howell,

29:35.867 --> 29:37.400
that broad from
the state department.

29:37.467 --> 29:39.266
- All right, I'm not gonna be
fucking Eleanor O'Connor.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.867
- Oh, no?
- No, 'cause I already did.

29:41.934 --> 29:43.133
- What?

29:43.200 --> 29:44.533
- She's my ex-wife.

29:46.133 --> 29:49.133
- You got--
jeez, man.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.367
- In Arkansas,

29:51.433 --> 29:53.633
a man can legally
beat his wife once a month.

29:53.700 --> 29:56.333
In Los Angeles,
pay attention now,

29:56.400 --> 29:59.700
a man can legally beat his wife
with a leather strap

29:59.767 --> 30:02.433
as long as the strap
is less than two inches wide.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.567
Or if the woman gives
her husband permission,

30:04.633 --> 30:07.567
he can use any
size strap he wants.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.200
- I don't care,
this is not right!

30:12.266 --> 30:13.600
- Leo free?

30:13.667 --> 30:14.867
- No.

30:14.934 --> 30:16.200
- God damn it!

30:16.266 --> 30:18.066
- Who's that?
- Officer Brass.

30:18.133 --> 30:20.333
- This is bullshit!
- Brass!

30:20.400 --> 30:21.567
- You know, if I could get

30:21.633 --> 30:22.900
another fucking job
somewhere else,

30:22.967 --> 30:24.200
I'd quit in a second.

30:24.266 --> 30:26.900
But I'm a gimp, nobody's
hiring gimps these days.

30:26.967 --> 30:28.233
- Dave, what's wrong?

30:28.300 --> 30:29.934
- Wall-to-wall bullshit.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
- Leo?

30:32.066 --> 30:35.166
- Well, he's pissed because
I've assigned him to reception,

30:35.233 --> 30:37.300
and that I won't let him
deal with the prisoners.

30:37.367 --> 30:38.800
You know,
put him back in Unit B.

30:38.867 --> 30:40.333
- Well, why won't you?

30:40.400 --> 30:42.467
- Tim, if there's trouble,
I need my C.O.s to be agile,

30:42.533 --> 30:46.567
to be able to move,
not hobble.

30:46.633 --> 30:48.600
- All the same,
he was cut on the job.

30:48.667 --> 30:50.000
- Hey, and I feel
badly for him.

30:50.066 --> 30:51.533
But I'm not
running a funhouse.

30:51.600 --> 30:55.800
Brass' desires fall on the far
side of the overall good.

30:56.900 --> 30:58.567
What did you want
to see me about?

30:58.633 --> 31:00.767
- It'll keep.

31:11.467 --> 31:13.600
Dave, I think
you should sue.

31:13.667 --> 31:16.100
- Sue? Sue who?

31:16.166 --> 31:19.100
- Oz, the whole
prison system,

31:19.166 --> 31:21.000
the fucking state,
if need be.

31:21.066 --> 31:22.367
- How can I sue?

31:22.433 --> 31:23.934
- Look, I checked
this out for you.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.367
In 1990, Congress passed

31:26.433 --> 31:27.834
the Americans
with Disabilities Act,

31:27.900 --> 31:29.533
which protects
the disabled from being

31:29.600 --> 31:31.100
discriminated against
in the workplace.

31:31.166 --> 31:33.967
- Yeah, but that's like for
wheelchair access and stuff.

31:34.033 --> 31:35.567
- No, no, no, not only,

31:35.633 --> 31:37.667
it covers people like you
who, because of their injuries,

31:37.734 --> 31:39.800
are demoted.

31:39.867 --> 31:41.300
- Well, I'd have
to get a lawyer.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.200
- Well, yeah, but maybe
you should try talking

31:43.266 --> 31:46.834
to this state liaison person,
this Eleanor O'Connor.

31:46.900 --> 31:48.900
Tell O'Connor
how you feel.

31:48.967 --> 31:51.233
- Okay, I will.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.967
- All right, and, uh,

31:54.033 --> 31:56.000
don't take any shit
from her.

32:10.066 --> 32:11.834
- Still work late, huh?

32:11.900 --> 32:14.900
- Yeah, well, you know.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.133
- I stopped by earlier,
but you weren't around.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.433
Took a tour of Emerald City.

32:20.500 --> 32:23.900
It is quite something
you've built here.

32:23.967 --> 32:26.300
Guess it was worth
walking out on me after all.

32:26.367 --> 32:27.567
- Ellie...

32:27.633 --> 32:29.533
- No recriminations, Tim.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.600
You made your choices;
I made mine.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.400
- Good to see you.
Want to grab some dinner?

32:37.467 --> 32:38.734
- No, thanks.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.133
I'm still up to my chest
in cardboard boxes.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.133
- Oh, well,

32:43.200 --> 32:44.667
another time then.

32:44.734 --> 32:48.266
- Had a chat with
your friend Dave Brass.

32:48.333 --> 32:50.667
Sad tale, his...

32:50.734 --> 32:53.600
Promising basketball career,
nipped in the Achilles.

32:53.667 --> 32:54.934
Had a chat
with the Warden too.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.900
He's reassigning him
to the cafeteria.

32:56.967 --> 32:58.834
- Good.

32:58.900 --> 33:01.033
- Yeah, it'll free up his hours
for physical therapy too.

33:01.100 --> 33:03.567
- See, I knew you could
turn the situation around.

33:03.633 --> 33:06.967
- You told him to sue the state?
- Well...

33:07.033 --> 33:09.133
- Were you serious, or were
you just testing me?

33:09.200 --> 33:10.333
- Both.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.934
- You son of a bitch.
- You know what?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.533
That's the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

33:15.600 --> 33:19.133
- Wait, I'm sure the name
calling will get much worse.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.367
- Looking forward to it.

33:20.433 --> 33:22.166
- Likewise, I'm sure.

33:36.367 --> 33:38.633
- Nice try.

33:48.800 --> 33:51.266
Hey, you want to play
some pool?

33:52.567 --> 33:56.066
You still torn up
about that bus accident?

33:56.133 --> 33:58.633
- Yeah.

33:58.700 --> 34:01.767
I just talked
to Carrie's parents.

34:01.834 --> 34:04.400
They're in town
for the funeral.

34:04.467 --> 34:08.033
They said they're taking Jewel
back to Montana with them.

34:08.100 --> 34:10.567
I might never see
my granddaughter again.

34:10.633 --> 34:14.567
- Yeah, that sucks, Vern,
but what can you do?

34:16.600 --> 34:19.100
- You never had kids,
did you?

34:19.166 --> 34:20.400
- Nah.

34:20.467 --> 34:22.567
My wife didn't want to mess
with her figure.

34:24.233 --> 34:25.700
- Well,

34:25.767 --> 34:26.900
then you don't have
a fucking clue

34:26.967 --> 34:28.400
what I'm talking about.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.500
- Bitch!

34:52.834 --> 34:53.900
Bye, baby.

34:56.900 --> 34:59.567
- Prisoner #97P468,

34:59.633 --> 35:02.734
Charles Pancamo,
AKA Chucky The Enforcer.

35:04.533 --> 35:07.333
Convicted June 4th, 1997,

35:07.400 --> 35:09.467
sentence, 35 years,

35:09.533 --> 35:13.000
up for parole in 15.

35:15.066 --> 35:17.767
- Get your feet
off my desk.

35:17.834 --> 35:19.100
All right, I wanted
to see all of you

35:19.166 --> 35:20.533
because I've got some news.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.500
Peter Schibetta's
returning to Em City today.

35:23.567 --> 35:26.033
- Schibetta? I thought
he was in the loony bin.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.033
- Well, not anymore.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.767
He's undergone
long-term therapy,

35:29.834 --> 35:31.967
and I'm happy to say
he's recovered.

35:32.033 --> 35:33.867
- You mean, he got over
being raped by Adebisi?

35:33.934 --> 35:36.467
- I don't want
to minimize his trauma

35:36.533 --> 35:38.900
or pretend that he's exactly
the way he was before,

35:38.967 --> 35:42.567
but he's learned to accept
and deal with the situation.

35:42.633 --> 35:44.333
- Be good to see Petey.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.133
He and me,
we came up together.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.667
And his father...

35:47.734 --> 35:49.767
- Yeah, his father
was a legend here.

35:49.834 --> 35:52.600
- Yeah, well, um,

35:52.667 --> 35:54.633
it's gonna be rough on him
for a few days.

35:54.700 --> 35:57.066
So all I ask is that you...

35:57.133 --> 35:59.066
tread lightly.

35:59.133 --> 36:00.667
- Don't you worry about it,
McManus.

36:00.734 --> 36:02.667
If there's one thing, we know
how to take care of our own.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.433
- It's all different, huh?

36:12.500 --> 36:13.767
- Yeah, the gas explosion

36:13.834 --> 36:16.100
pretty much
obliterated the place.

36:16.166 --> 36:18.066
- Good.

36:18.133 --> 36:20.100
- Come on!

36:26.767 --> 36:29.066
- There you go.

36:29.133 --> 36:30.700
- Come with me.
- Where?

36:30.767 --> 36:32.567
- The FBI wants to talk
to you.

36:32.633 --> 36:34.667
- FBI?

36:34.734 --> 36:36.000
Fuckin' want talk to me?

36:36.066 --> 36:38.300
- Just move it,
Pancamo.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.266
- Do you know a man
named Gaetano Cincetta?

36:53.734 --> 36:54.834
- Not that I recall.

36:54.900 --> 36:57.166
- You don't know him?

36:57.233 --> 36:58.233
- Not that I recall.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.700
- You never met him?

37:00.767 --> 37:02.166
- Not that I recall.

37:02.233 --> 37:03.800
- That's odd.

37:03.867 --> 37:05.500
Mr. Cincetta,

37:05.567 --> 37:08.834
who just blabbed his way into
the Witness Protection Program,

37:08.900 --> 37:12.834
says you hired him
to kill someone.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.000
Hank Schillinger.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.867
Do you know
Hank Schillinger?

37:15.934 --> 37:17.300
- Not that I recall.

37:17.367 --> 37:18.900
- He's the son
of Vernon Schillinger.

37:18.967 --> 37:20.800
Do you know
Vernon Schillinger?

37:20.867 --> 37:22.033
- Not that I recall.

37:22.100 --> 37:23.900
- He's a fellow resident
here at Oswald.

37:23.967 --> 37:25.233
You remember him now?

37:25.300 --> 37:27.367
- To the best
of my recoglection--

37:27.433 --> 37:28.800
- Recollection.

37:28.867 --> 37:30.600
- I don't know
the fucking guy.

37:30.667 --> 37:33.000
- Chris Keller confessed
to hiring a hit man

37:33.066 --> 37:34.333
to kill Hank Schillinger,

37:34.400 --> 37:35.900
only he never
identified who.

37:35.967 --> 37:37.734
Mr. Cincetta says
he's never heard of Keller.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.934
We gave Keller
a lie detector test.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.100
Turns out he lied about
his part in the murder.

37:42.166 --> 37:45.734
Now, why do you think
Keller would do that?

37:45.800 --> 37:47.000
- Nice tie.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.667
Okay, Officer,

37:50.734 --> 37:51.967
take this weasel back

37:52.033 --> 37:54.133
to whatever hole
he crawled out of.

37:55.767 --> 37:58.700
I guess my next conversation's
with Vern Schillinger.

37:58.767 --> 38:00.767
I wonder
if he'll remember you.

38:06.433 --> 38:08.900
- He's gonna tell Schillinger
that I ordered the hit.

38:08.967 --> 38:11.867
Then Schillinger's gonna come
searching for details.

38:11.934 --> 38:14.400
- Fuck!

38:14.467 --> 38:16.000
You know, when I asked you
to hire somebody

38:16.066 --> 38:18.100
to kill Hank Schillinger,

38:18.166 --> 38:19.433
you said nobody
would find the body,

38:19.500 --> 38:22.934
not in a million years;
you guaranteed it.

38:23.033 --> 38:25.834
Well, it only took
six fucking months.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.700
Seems like you did
a really half-assed job.

38:27.767 --> 38:29.633
- Hey, you be careful.

38:29.700 --> 38:33.700
To be honest, Gaetano Cincetta
was a big disappointment.

38:33.767 --> 38:35.033
- Schillinger's
gonna cut off my balls

38:35.100 --> 38:36.066
if he finds out the truth.

38:36.133 --> 38:37.233
- He won't!

38:37.300 --> 38:40.000
Look, it was my screw-up,

38:40.066 --> 38:41.467
so I'm gonna cover for you.

38:41.533 --> 38:44.066
- Yeah, well,
I'll sleep well tonight.

38:48.300 --> 38:52.433
- That's the thing
about Oz, you know?

38:52.500 --> 38:55.533
You try to put the shit
behind you,

38:55.600 --> 38:58.433
make a real effort.

38:58.500 --> 39:02.834
And just when you're thinking,
"Maybe I have,"

39:02.900 --> 39:04.900
more shit comes flying.

39:07.033 --> 39:09.667
You sure it was Pancamo
put the mark on Hank?

39:09.734 --> 39:11.967
- Absolutely sure.

39:19.166 --> 39:22.033
- Hey, you,
you fucking dago!

39:22.100 --> 39:23.633
You killed my son.

39:36.266 --> 39:38.533
- Ahh!

40:14.633 --> 40:16.233
I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

40:16.300 --> 40:17.800
Just give me
a fucking Band-Aid.

40:17.867 --> 40:19.233
- Oh, let's see.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.266
- Okay--whoop.

40:40.333 --> 40:42.600
- Jimmy?

40:44.967 --> 40:46.600
- Sister Pete,
what's going on?

40:46.667 --> 40:48.333
- The Aryans attacked
the Sicilians.

40:48.400 --> 40:52.500
Pancamo hired the hit man
to kill Hank Schillinger.

40:52.567 --> 40:54.367
- Oh, I see.

40:54.433 --> 40:56.400
- Keller wasn't involved
in Hank's death,

40:56.467 --> 40:58.734
so Massachusetts
has no reason to hold him.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.066
- Wait, that means...

41:01.133 --> 41:04.033
- Chris Keller
is coming back to Oz.

41:12.433 --> 41:14.900
- McManus,
hold up, hold up.

41:14.967 --> 41:16.233
Can I--can I
have a word with you?

41:16.300 --> 41:17.600
- Sorry, I'm on the run.

41:17.667 --> 41:20.233
- Oh, please don't do me
like this, man.

41:20.300 --> 41:21.867
Heartless motherfucker.

41:21.934 --> 41:23.867
- Ooh...

41:23.934 --> 41:25.400
- What the fuck
did you say to me?

41:27.166 --> 41:28.734
I got a big heart
a few days ago.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.133
Now I'm fucking heartless?

41:30.200 --> 41:33.166
- I didn't mean it, okay?

41:33.233 --> 41:34.667
- Well, I'm here,
what do you want?

41:34.734 --> 41:38.633
- I know that you done
everything you can to help me.

41:38.700 --> 41:41.033
But sitting here,

41:41.100 --> 41:43.166
I've come up with
a whole new solution.

41:43.233 --> 41:44.567
If I could just, you know,

41:44.633 --> 41:45.900
hang with you a bit,
you know.

41:45.967 --> 41:48.100
No, no, no, no,
not like before.

41:48.166 --> 41:49.900
No, just--if I could just,
you know, chill in your office,

41:49.967 --> 41:51.400
you know,
just from time to time.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.867
- No! Jesus Christ!

41:53.934 --> 41:57.200
- Well, what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

41:57.266 --> 41:58.734
I mean, yo,

41:58.800 --> 42:00.900
you're the only friend
I got here.

42:00.967 --> 42:03.500
I mean, just anything, just
to have somebody to talk to.

42:03.567 --> 42:05.533
- All right, vacation's over,
come on, White.

42:05.600 --> 42:06.633
Out.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.500
- Look, uh...

42:16.567 --> 42:18.033
Help me, please.

42:18.100 --> 42:20.066
- I'll try to think
of something, okay?

42:20.133 --> 42:22.033
- What am I supposed to be
doing while you thinking?

42:22.100 --> 42:24.300
- Well, if it takes
staying in your cell 24/7

42:24.367 --> 42:25.467
to steer clear
of trouble...

42:25.533 --> 42:26.967
- That's worse
than the cage.

42:27.033 --> 42:30.133
That'd be like
being back in Solitary.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.567
Damn.

42:46.033 --> 42:48.867
- Take that bread
out your mouth.

42:53.834 --> 42:54.767
- Sorry, Minister.

42:54.834 --> 42:56.266
- Oh, you sorry?

42:56.333 --> 42:58.433
- Yes, Minister, forgive me.

42:58.500 --> 43:00.533
- Get up.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.333
Walk away.
- What?

43:02.400 --> 43:04.667
- You can't quell your desire
for even a moment

43:04.734 --> 43:07.700
in order to give thanks
and praise to Allah?

43:07.767 --> 43:09.834
Grab your tray.

43:11.800 --> 43:14.967
Take off your kufi.

43:15.033 --> 43:17.367
- Imam, you're being
too severe.

43:17.433 --> 43:19.867
- Oh, you--
you're testing me, Arif?

43:19.934 --> 43:21.800
- Brother Lalar
is new to the fold.

43:21.867 --> 43:26.033
Scold him, take away his food,
but don't cast him out.

43:26.100 --> 43:28.100
- You'll sit down?

43:28.166 --> 43:30.967
You sit down?
Did I tell you to sit down?

43:31.033 --> 43:32.300
You cannot sit down!

43:32.367 --> 43:34.333
- Hey! Hey!

43:34.400 --> 43:36.533
- Did I tell you
you can sit down?

43:36.600 --> 43:37.700
Did I?

43:40.633 --> 43:43.000
- So what was
all that about?

43:43.066 --> 43:44.500
Why'd you attack
Ahmad Lalar?

43:44.567 --> 43:46.000
- You keep me
from going to the Hole,

43:46.066 --> 43:47.533
so now in return, I got
to answer your questions?

43:47.600 --> 43:48.567
- Yeah.

43:48.633 --> 43:50.166
Although part of me thinks

43:50.233 --> 43:52.233
I'm not gonna get
any answers from you.

43:52.300 --> 43:54.166
I mean, a man who used
to fight with words

43:54.233 --> 43:58.166
is now not only using his fists,
he's choking Muslims.

43:58.233 --> 44:01.100
Give you 10 to 1 odds you
don't have the slightest clue

44:01.166 --> 44:02.834
why you're doing
the things you're doing.

44:02.900 --> 44:06.200
- And you would
lose the bet.

44:06.266 --> 44:09.133
The day Adebisi died,
I changed,

44:09.200 --> 44:11.834
and I took his life
to save my own.

44:11.900 --> 44:15.467
That was the Adebisi side of me
coming to the surface.

44:15.533 --> 44:19.100
Only now, I realize it hasn't
just come to the surface.

44:19.166 --> 44:20.900
It's at the very center
of who I am.

44:20.967 --> 44:23.133
- Bullshit.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.900
Everybody's got demons.

44:25.967 --> 44:27.734
But you've given all the weight
of who you are

44:27.800 --> 44:29.233
over to this horrible shit

44:29.300 --> 44:31.500
you're discovering
about yourself.

44:31.567 --> 44:33.967
Yet, you're more equipped
than any other prisoner in Oz

44:34.033 --> 44:36.734
to straighten yourself out,
and you know it.

44:36.800 --> 44:39.100
And knowing that
and having failed to do so

44:39.166 --> 44:41.533
has fucked you up even more.

44:41.600 --> 44:42.834
- Just put me
in the Hole, McManus.

44:42.900 --> 44:43.934
- I'm not putting you
in the Hole.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.100
- Please.

44:45.166 --> 44:46.734
- I'm giving you
a job instead.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.166
- A job?

44:48.233 --> 44:50.333
- You want to
save yourself, Kareem?

44:52.867 --> 44:54.600
- Yes.

44:54.667 --> 44:57.033
- Well, I want you
to save somebody else.

45:01.033 --> 45:03.600
- What you looking at?

45:03.667 --> 45:05.200
What's he doing here?

45:06.834 --> 45:09.233
What--what the fuck is he
looking at me like that for?

45:09.300 --> 45:10.900
- I'm the one
who's gonna help you.

45:10.967 --> 45:12.300
- I don't need
no motherfucking help,

45:12.367 --> 45:13.567
especially from him.

45:13.633 --> 45:15.100
Man, what--what
you gonna do for me?

45:15.166 --> 45:16.700
- Kareem's gonna be
your new sponsor.

45:16.767 --> 45:18.266
- Sponsor?

45:18.333 --> 45:20.000
- Starting today, you and I
will share the same pod.

45:20.066 --> 45:22.133
We will exercise together,
we will eat together,

45:22.200 --> 45:24.033
we will work alongside
of each other.

45:24.100 --> 45:26.734
- You still need to meet with
Sister Pete for counseling,

45:26.800 --> 45:29.100
and your attendance is mandatory
at all drug rehab sessions.

45:29.166 --> 45:32.367
Plus, the Warden wants you
tested for drugs once a week.

45:32.433 --> 45:33.867
Now, Omar,

45:33.934 --> 45:36.600
this is your last play,
and it's fourth and long.

45:36.667 --> 45:38.600
You miss one meeting,
you get in one fight,

45:38.667 --> 45:40.867
you piss Said off one time,

45:40.934 --> 45:42.934
it's back to Solitary
permanently.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.133
You understand me?

45:44.200 --> 45:46.900
-  All right.

45:49.166 --> 45:51.800
Hey, yeah.

45:51.867 --> 45:53.233
Yeah.

46:06.033 --> 46:09.300
Yeah, boy!

46:09.367 --> 46:11.400
My boy is something else,
ain't he?

46:11.467 --> 46:13.467
McManus, jack...

46:13.533 --> 46:15.700
That motherfucker's
like a straight-up brainiac,

46:15.767 --> 46:17.734
you know, genius motherfucker
and shit, boy.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.266
Shit.

46:19.333 --> 46:21.200
Well, he be coming up with
all kind of little ways,

46:21.266 --> 46:23.734
you know, and shit, you know,
to help me try to lick my--

46:23.800 --> 46:26.900
uh, what's it called?
Shortcomings.

46:28.533 --> 46:30.233
Yeah, and I done fucked
with him a couple of times too

46:30.300 --> 46:31.767
and shit, you know?

46:31.834 --> 46:33.567
You know what?
Having me, you know,

46:33.633 --> 46:35.734
all up in your draft and shit,
picking up all of them,

46:35.800 --> 46:38.166
you know,
Said-ian vibrations--

46:38.233 --> 46:41.400
- First of all,
don't hustle me.

46:41.467 --> 46:44.166
Wait, hold up, baby.

46:44.233 --> 46:45.600
Yo, you got to chill, baby.

46:45.667 --> 46:49.133
- Second of all,
I am not your baby.

46:49.200 --> 46:51.467
My name is Minister Said,

46:51.533 --> 46:53.967
and you will
address me as such.

46:54.033 --> 46:55.367
- No, no, no,
fuck that shit, all right.

46:55.433 --> 46:56.700
I mean, I told you, man,
about that shit, you know.

46:56.767 --> 46:58.033
You ain't coming up here,

46:58.100 --> 46:59.200
converting my ass
up in here, man.

46:59.266 --> 47:00.700
That shit is out, forget it.

47:00.767 --> 47:04.166
- I am not converting you.

47:04.233 --> 47:07.166
Also, I am not
gonna argue with you.

47:07.233 --> 47:08.667
This thing is over.

47:08.734 --> 47:10.467
Get out.

47:10.533 --> 47:11.467
- What?

47:11.533 --> 47:12.934
- Out!

47:13.000 --> 47:14.767
- Whoa.

47:14.834 --> 47:16.667
Look, shut the door,
all right?

47:16.734 --> 47:20.000
I'm sorry,
shut it, please.

47:20.066 --> 47:22.166
- Make your bed.

47:23.834 --> 47:26.633
Make your bed.

47:47.934 --> 47:51.934
I will not fight.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.266
- You talking to me?

47:53.333 --> 47:55.033
- Say it,

47:55.100 --> 47:56.834
"I will not fight."

48:00.633 --> 48:02.400
- I will not fight.

48:02.467 --> 48:03.567
- Again.

48:06.834 --> 48:08.934
- I will not fight.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.266
- From now on,
that will be your mantra.

48:11.333 --> 48:13.266
Every time another inmate
gets in your face,

48:13.333 --> 48:16.300
you will say,
"I will not fight."

48:16.367 --> 48:19.300
You will say it over and over,

48:19.367 --> 48:22.500
out loud if you have to.

48:22.567 --> 48:24.200
- I will not fight.

48:24.266 --> 48:25.934
- Yeah.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.033
- I will not fight,
I will not fight.

48:30.100 --> 48:32.133
I will not fight.

48:32.200 --> 48:34.266
If I could just
conquer not fighting,

48:34.333 --> 48:36.400
shit, I'm home free, boy.

48:36.467 --> 48:37.900
I mean, there's nothing
in the world

48:37.967 --> 48:40.800
I hate more than
motherfucking Solitary.

48:42.667 --> 48:46.200
If I go back in there,
fucking worms...

48:46.266 --> 48:48.200
- Worms?
- Yeah, man, motherfucking...

48:48.266 --> 48:49.667
- What are you
talking about, worms?

48:49.734 --> 48:51.000
- In my head!

48:51.066 --> 48:54.834
Every time I go back,
it's the worms.

48:54.900 --> 48:57.767
Fat ones,
big ones, long ones.

49:00.667 --> 49:03.066
I can't survive
the fucking worms!

49:03.133 --> 49:06.066
I think about spending
the rest of my life

49:06.133 --> 49:09.667
in this Em City joint.

49:14.533 --> 49:18.300
18,000 days,

49:18.367 --> 49:20.200
23,000 days.

49:20.266 --> 49:22.266
That's a lot of days.

49:22.333 --> 49:26.066
Lot of days not to fight,
not to get high.

49:26.133 --> 49:28.300
Think about it like that.

49:33.533 --> 49:35.967
My chances
don't look too good.

49:47.700 --> 49:49.500
- In Nogales, Arizona,

49:49.567 --> 49:52.600
it's illegal
to wear suspenders.

49:52.667 --> 49:54.500
You gotta wonder
what happened.

49:54.567 --> 49:56.600
What cataclysmic
event occurred

49:56.667 --> 49:58.600
which caused the city fathers
to decree that,

49:58.667 --> 50:01.233
"In our town, no one,
under any circumstances,

50:01.300 --> 50:02.867
can wear suspenders"?

50:02.934 --> 50:05.533
And are there radical
fringe groups in Nogales

50:05.600 --> 50:08.333
who meet at night in secret,
who slip off their belts

50:08.400 --> 50:12.133
and, in defiance of the law,
put these suckers on, huh?

50:12.200 --> 50:13.467
- How's Cloutier?

50:13.533 --> 50:15.000
- Oh, his vital signs
are stable,

50:15.066 --> 50:17.333
but he still can't move
very much.

50:17.400 --> 50:18.834
- Is he talking yet?

50:18.900 --> 50:21.834
- Um, no, only
guttural sounds.

50:21.900 --> 50:23.700
- Could I see him?

50:23.767 --> 50:25.600
- Ray,
he's pretty disfigured.

50:25.667 --> 50:27.767
- I was an assistant chaplain
at Benchley Memorial

50:27.834 --> 50:29.100
when I was a seminarian.

50:29.166 --> 50:30.800
I've seen burn victims.

50:39.333 --> 50:41.734
Oh, sweet Jesus.

50:49.834 --> 50:51.834
Jeremiah?

50:55.900 --> 50:58.633
If you don't mind,
I'd like to say a prayer.

51:01.400 --> 51:04.500
Our Father, who art in heaven,

51:04.567 --> 51:06.100
hallowed be thy name.

51:07.266 --> 51:09.200
Thy kingdom come...

51:09.266 --> 51:10.700
- Thy will be done,

51:10.767 --> 51:13.066
on Earth
as it is in heaven.

51:14.467 --> 51:16.066
- Give us this day
our daily bread

51:16.133 --> 51:19.333
and forgive us
our trespasses...

51:23.233 --> 51:24.767
It's open.

51:28.567 --> 51:29.734
- Mukada?

51:29.800 --> 51:32.367
- Come in,
leave the door open.

51:35.500 --> 51:37.600
What did you need
to see me about?

51:39.100 --> 51:41.200
- I heard that you're
planning a memorial service

51:41.266 --> 51:43.000
to honor the victims
and the families

51:43.066 --> 51:44.600
who were killed
in the bus crash.

51:44.667 --> 51:47.900
- Yes, I've asked Arif
and Rabbi Gold

51:47.967 --> 51:49.233
and Reverend Taylor

51:49.300 --> 51:50.633
from the First Baptist
to participate.

51:50.700 --> 51:52.300
- But not me.

51:52.367 --> 51:53.834
- You?

51:53.900 --> 51:56.900
- Ever since Jeremiah Cloutier's
unfortunate accident...

51:56.967 --> 51:58.867
- I would hardly call
being bricked up into a wall

51:58.934 --> 52:00.133
accidental.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.500
- I meant
the third-degree burns

52:01.567 --> 52:03.533
he suffered from
the gas explosion.

52:03.600 --> 52:05.033
- Oh.

52:05.100 --> 52:06.367
- Since then,
I've been ministering

52:06.433 --> 52:08.200
to many of
the Christians in Oz.

52:08.266 --> 52:10.500
- Getting up on stage
and reading from a Bible

52:10.567 --> 52:14.200
doesn't constitute
a ministry.

52:14.266 --> 52:17.633
- You're still holding a grudge
because I rejected Romanism.

52:17.700 --> 52:19.700
- No, as a matter
of fact, I'm glad

52:19.767 --> 52:21.867
you're no longer part
of my congregation.

52:21.934 --> 52:25.500
- I demand to be included
in the ecumenical service.

52:25.567 --> 52:27.333
- You're not qualified.

52:27.400 --> 52:29.166
- I'm an ordained priest.

52:29.233 --> 52:31.633
-  Since when?

52:31.700 --> 52:33.133
- I signed up by mail.

52:33.200 --> 52:35.600
50 bucks, see?

52:37.600 --> 52:39.367
- Get out of my office.

52:40.800 --> 52:42.934
I'll go over your head,
to the Warden.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.500
- Yeah,
and he'll ignore you.

52:44.567 --> 52:46.000
- Then I'll go over
his head to God.

52:46.066 --> 52:48.433
- Listen,
you little punk.

52:48.500 --> 52:51.200
We know that you were involved
in Cloutier's accident.

52:51.266 --> 52:53.567
And as soon as he's able
to talk, to testify,

52:53.633 --> 52:56.633
you're going to Solitary for
the rest of your goddamn life!

53:01.100 --> 53:02.867
- We have to kill Cloutier,
right now.

53:02.934 --> 53:04.033
His throat's still sore
from the burns,

53:04.100 --> 53:05.800
but when he's well,
he's gonna sing

53:05.867 --> 53:07.467
and we'll all be up
shit's creek.

53:07.533 --> 53:09.133
- Look, I'm already
up the creek, pal, okay?

53:09.200 --> 53:11.633
- Look, Jaz, I know that
because you were the one

53:11.700 --> 53:13.633
in charge of
the work detail that day,

53:13.700 --> 53:15.600
you've taken the heat
for the rest of us.

53:15.667 --> 53:18.834
But that's no reason
that Cloutier should live.

53:18.900 --> 53:20.934
- Look, he dies,
the hacks blame me.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.433
- Right, right.
- Okay?

53:22.500 --> 53:26.800
- So the person who kills him
has to be above reproach.

53:28.834 --> 53:30.266
Jim?

53:30.333 --> 53:33.200
- No, I can't.

53:33.266 --> 53:35.133
Cloutier
brought me to Jesus.

53:35.200 --> 53:37.033
- Jim, if you're not
part of the solution,

53:37.100 --> 53:38.033
you're Satan's tool.

53:38.100 --> 53:39.467
- Yeah.

53:39.533 --> 53:43.066
Do the deed or die.

54:05.166 --> 54:09.333
- Jim? Jim Burns?

54:09.400 --> 54:12.266
Those men want you
to kill me, Jim,

54:12.333 --> 54:15.133
but you know that
what they ask is wrong.

54:15.200 --> 54:16.500
- Yes.

54:16.567 --> 54:20.400
- So I say unto you,
kill them.

54:20.467 --> 54:23.166
Kill Hoyt and Kirk.

54:35.100 --> 54:38.033
- The Reverend Cloutier
was in my cell last night.

54:38.100 --> 54:39.467
- For what, a blow job?

54:39.533 --> 54:41.133
- This ain't funny.

54:41.200 --> 54:42.633
- You had a dream.

54:42.700 --> 54:44.300
- It was no dream.

54:44.367 --> 54:45.567
- Chickenshit.

54:45.633 --> 54:47.066
- You're trying
to get out of the job.

54:47.133 --> 54:49.767
Go kill the cocksucker.

54:49.834 --> 54:51.433
- No!
- No?

54:51.500 --> 54:52.700
- He told me to kill you!

55:09.767 --> 55:11.266
- Son of a bitch...

55:12.867 --> 55:14.533
- It's self-defense.
It's...

55:14.600 --> 55:16.033
It's motherfucking
self-defense.

55:16.100 --> 55:17.200
I got witnesses.

55:17.266 --> 55:18.367
You got nothing on me,

55:18.433 --> 55:20.166
There was
fuckin' 10 guys there.

55:20.233 --> 55:21.934
- Put him in the Hole.

55:25.166 --> 55:27.033
- Self-defense!

55:33.467 --> 55:35.834
- Will we be having
a service for Jim?

55:38.133 --> 55:39.567
- Yes, of course.

55:39.633 --> 55:42.667
We must pray
for his immortal soul.

55:44.200 --> 55:45.934
- Lights out!

55:46.600 --> 55:49.433
- Man-made laws
are arbitrary, transitory.

55:49.500 --> 55:51.166
What was perfectly legal
yesterday

55:51.233 --> 55:52.767
suddenly becomes
a felony today

55:52.834 --> 55:55.567
with the stroke
of some president's pen.

55:55.633 --> 55:59.333
The laws of God, however,
are carved in stone.

55:59.400 --> 56:01.400
They do not change.

56:01.467 --> 56:03.100
And when you break God's law,

56:03.166 --> 56:05.967
you don't go to prison;
you go to hell.

56:08.667 --> 56:10.467
And you burn.

56:25.300 --> 56:27.500
- Hoyt...

56:35.633 --> 56:38.767
- Don't be afraid.
