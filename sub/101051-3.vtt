WEBVTT

01:16.012 --> 01:18.015
[bell tolling distantly]

01:33.003 --> 01:35.021
[officer] Niles Evelyn Caulder.

01:35.023 --> 01:38.019
What the devil are you
doing out? Don't you know
there's a ripper about?

01:38.021 --> 01:40.012
Yes, sir.

01:40.014 --> 01:42.020
There's no one
to fleece tonight anyway,
you little tea leaf.

01:42.022 --> 01:45.009
Go on. Get going home.
Or by Christ, I'll have you.

01:45.011 --> 01:46.009
Yes, sir.

01:58.021 --> 01:59.020
[chuckles]

02:05.014 --> 02:06.013
[watch clicks]

02:06.015 --> 02:08.012
[wind whooshing]

02:13.020 --> 02:15.012
[woman screams and thuds]

02:24.020 --> 02:26.023
[woman panting]

02:30.010 --> 02:32.017
[speaking indistinctly
and breathing heavily]

02:53.019 --> 02:54.021
Curious.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.015
Are you the Ripper, sir?

03:00.017 --> 03:02.019
[gasps] Are you?

03:03.013 --> 03:05.016
[laughing]

03:09.004 --> 03:11.008
[laughing heartily]

03:14.011 --> 03:15.011
[woman screams]

03:22.010 --> 03:23.023
Okay, Papa.

03:24.001 --> 03:25.011
You can open them now.

03:29.017 --> 03:31.001
[sighs deeply]

03:31.003 --> 03:33.013
French toast.

03:33.015 --> 03:35.020
-Did you make this?
-Rita taught me.

03:35.022 --> 03:37.014
That was very good of her.

03:37.016 --> 03:40.014
It's about all I'm good for.
Cooking lessons.

03:40.016 --> 03:43.009
Taste it. Taste it!

03:43.022 --> 03:44.020
Okay.

03:52.004 --> 03:53.006
Mmm!

03:53.008 --> 03:56.009
[laughing] It's wonderful!

03:56.011 --> 03:58.003
It's...

03:58.005 --> 04:00.006
-It's really delicious!
-[Dorothy] Do you
really mean it, Papa?

04:00.008 --> 04:02.010
[Niles] I really do, darling.

04:05.007 --> 04:07.018
-Good morning, Cliff.
-[Cliff] Something's wrong
with my hand.

04:07.020 --> 04:09.012
The fingers are all slow.

04:09.014 --> 04:13.007
I'll look at it as soon
as I finish my very
special breakfast.

04:13.009 --> 04:14.008
[distorted] Too...

04:14.010 --> 04:16.007
fucking...

04:16.009 --> 04:19.005
slow.

04:19.007 --> 04:21.002
[Dorothy chuckling]

04:24.018 --> 04:27.012
Rita, Dorothy, would you
give us a minute, please?

04:27.014 --> 04:30.017
Come, Dorothy.
Let's go water the plants.

04:34.018 --> 04:37.014
How about when
my 11-year-old daughter
is in the room,

04:37.016 --> 04:39.019
we take the swearing
down a notch?

04:39.021 --> 04:41.003
[Cliff] No problem.

04:41.005 --> 04:42.023
Does she know sign language?

04:45.007 --> 04:48.001
When you're ready
to confront this anger, Cliff,

04:48.021 --> 04:50.009
I'll be there for you.

04:50.011 --> 04:53.000
Pretty sure
I'm confronting my anger
right now, Chief.

04:53.002 --> 04:55.004
And it feels fucking good.

04:55.006 --> 04:57.010
Till then, I suggest
you go away

04:57.012 --> 05:00.008
-and do some work on your own.
-What the fuck's
that supposed to mean?

05:00.010 --> 05:03.006
You were an angry man long
before you and I ever met.

05:03.008 --> 05:05.011
An angry husband.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.003
An angry father.

05:07.005 --> 05:09.006
Hey, I was
a great fucking father.

05:09.008 --> 05:10.017
I was way better than you.

05:10.019 --> 05:12.019
'Cause my kid didn't grow up
to be a monster

05:12.021 --> 05:14.006
who could destroy
the entire world.

05:14.008 --> 05:16.017
You call my daughter
a "monster" again--

05:16.019 --> 05:18.004
[Cliff] And you'll do what?

05:18.006 --> 05:20.023
Huh? What more could you
possibly do to me?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.011
Hey, Jane, you wanna
get the fuck out of here?

05:28.002 --> 05:29.012
Fuck, yeah.

05:36.016 --> 05:38.002
Sorry about that.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.023
Let's go back and finish
our special breakfast. Mmm?

05:41.022 --> 05:44.007
Why does Cliff
hate you so much?

05:44.009 --> 05:46.009
Did you do something wrong?

05:48.022 --> 05:49.020
I did.

05:51.007 --> 05:53.007
I made a very bad mistake.

05:54.007 --> 05:55.022
Lots of mistakes, actually.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.014
Did you apologize?

05:58.016 --> 06:00.013
Many times.

06:00.015 --> 06:04.012
Some wounds can't be healed
with pretty words.

06:04.014 --> 06:06.021
This isn't something
you need to worry about.

06:06.023 --> 06:08.006
My dear heart,

06:08.008 --> 06:09.021
it's a grown-up problem.

06:09.023 --> 06:12.003
[wings fluttering]

06:16.002 --> 06:17.012
Are those...

06:17.014 --> 06:19.006
Butterflies!

06:19.008 --> 06:23.006
It can't be. Dorothy, no!

06:23.008 --> 06:27.003
Please tell me
this is a seasonal migration,
and not something freaky.

06:27.005 --> 06:29.009
[butterflies whooshing]

06:30.008 --> 06:32.010
[man laughing sinisterly]

06:34.007 --> 06:35.015
Oh, God damn it.

06:35.017 --> 06:37.008
What is it, Papa?

06:39.000 --> 06:42.014
I've been invited to a dinner
with the divine Red Jack.

06:42.016 --> 06:44.011
"Formal attire preferred."

06:45.012 --> 06:47.021
That looks
like Larry's bandages.

06:47.023 --> 06:49.014
This isn't an invitation.

06:49.016 --> 06:51.006
It's a very polite ransom note.

06:51.008 --> 06:54.002
This Red Jack person has Larry?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.013
Why? Who is he?

06:57.016 --> 06:59.010
I'll explain on the way.

06:59.012 --> 07:02.009
Now, it's important
you understand
what we're up against.

07:02.011 --> 07:04.020
"We"? Oh, no.
I'll sit this one out.

07:04.022 --> 07:07.001
-No, Larry needs you.
-For Larry's sake.

07:07.003 --> 07:08.020
Please, I will just make
things worse.

07:08.022 --> 07:11.019
I have the purple brains
spattered on my shoes
to prove it.

07:11.021 --> 07:14.001
Red Jack is a merciless being

07:14.003 --> 07:17.008
who feeds on the suffering
of others.

07:18.007 --> 07:19.015
I cannot do this alone.

07:19.017 --> 07:21.011
I'm on the fence,
and that's your sales pitch?

07:21.013 --> 07:23.018
He lives in an extra
dimensional palace

07:23.020 --> 07:29.003
and drops down into our world
to refill on fresh pain.

07:29.005 --> 07:30.021
He's committed
countless atrocities

07:30.023 --> 07:32.012
under the guises
of Jack the Ripper,

07:32.014 --> 07:34.019
-the Monster of Florence--
-Larry's in danger. I get it.

07:34.021 --> 07:38.002
-Just please stop talking.
-Right. Right.

07:38.004 --> 07:40.016
-If we get separated--
-Why would we get separated?

07:40.018 --> 07:42.016
We won't. But if we do,

07:42.018 --> 07:45.006
follow the butterflies.

07:45.008 --> 07:46.021
Oh, God damn it.

07:48.003 --> 07:49.002
Ready?

08:01.018 --> 08:03.002
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

08:03.004 --> 08:04.019
[Cliff] Fuck, fuck, fuck.

08:04.021 --> 08:08.000
He actually had the nerve
to tell me, me,

08:08.002 --> 08:11.009
not to swear
in front of <i>his</i><i>daughter.</i>
Can you believe that shit?

08:11.011 --> 08:13.000
[flatly] I can
hardly believe it.

08:13.002 --> 08:16.000
After he fucked my life
in the asshole, and Clara's.

08:16.002 --> 08:18.012
What about my little girl?

08:18.014 --> 08:20.013
She grew up
without her fucking father.

08:20.015 --> 08:21.021
I mean, fuck!

08:21.023 --> 08:23.003
Yeah, fuck.

08:23.005 --> 08:24.011
[Cliff] This is
what's gonna happen.

08:24.013 --> 08:25.021
I give Clara the giraffe.

08:25.023 --> 08:28.014
We hug it the fuck out.
All is forgiven.

08:28.016 --> 08:33.006
And her happiness
is gonna fuck Niles Caulder
in the fucking face.

08:33.008 --> 08:34.007
Am I right?

08:35.011 --> 08:36.009
Jane?

08:37.021 --> 08:39.001
Jane?

08:39.003 --> 08:40.001
Okay.

08:42.012 --> 08:43.013
Awesome.

08:43.015 --> 08:44.020
Best road dog ever.

08:50.023 --> 08:52.004
[voices speaking indistinctly]

09:10.000 --> 09:10.023
[girl] Jane.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.002
Thank you for coming.

09:13.004 --> 09:15.017
You d-holes yanked me
down here.

09:15.019 --> 09:17.013
So, what gives?

09:23.013 --> 09:25.005
Is this a fucking intervention?

09:28.006 --> 09:29.004
[scoffs]

09:39.016 --> 09:40.016
[Roni] Morning.

09:41.021 --> 09:42.019
Hey.

09:43.022 --> 09:45.019
Where is everyone?

09:45.021 --> 09:47.010
Tuesday morning,
nine o'clock, right?

09:47.012 --> 09:50.007
E-mail went out last night.
We switched to Wednesdays.

09:50.009 --> 09:51.015
For real? Why didn't I get it?

09:51.017 --> 09:53.011
Because I'm the one
who sent it.

09:53.013 --> 09:54.018
And you left me off?

09:56.018 --> 09:57.016
Why?

10:05.001 --> 10:07.004
[both moaning]

10:15.009 --> 10:17.013
[both breathing heavily]

10:21.002 --> 10:22.002
Hey, whoa.

10:22.004 --> 10:23.010
What's wrong?

10:25.003 --> 10:26.012
We... We barely know
each other.

10:26.014 --> 10:28.017
-And?
-No... [chuckles awkwardly]

10:55.009 --> 10:56.012
Now you know.

10:57.019 --> 10:58.018
[sighs]

10:59.020 --> 11:00.018
Wow.

11:02.012 --> 11:03.014
You're beautiful.

11:21.011 --> 11:23.019
Can I touch your chest?

11:29.023 --> 11:30.022
[sighs]

11:33.007 --> 11:34.006
Can you feel that?

11:57.004 --> 11:58.003
Can you feel that?

12:13.006 --> 12:14.005
What about that?

12:16.023 --> 12:18.001
Not sure.

12:18.003 --> 12:19.002
[both chuckle]

12:28.001 --> 12:30.004
[Larry groaning]

12:46.023 --> 12:49.011
[yells in pain]

12:49.013 --> 12:52.015
[panting] What the fuck
is going on?

12:52.017 --> 12:53.020
Help!

12:53.022 --> 12:55.012
[groaning]

12:57.020 --> 13:00.005
No. No, no. No.

13:00.007 --> 13:02.006
Oh, God. No.

13:02.008 --> 13:04.002
No, no. Oh, God.

13:04.004 --> 13:05.011
No, no, no, no.

13:05.013 --> 13:07.002
[gasping loudly]

13:07.004 --> 13:09.017
[panting] No!

13:10.011 --> 13:12.013
[yelling]

13:17.010 --> 13:20.008
You must be Larry. Welcome.

13:20.010 --> 13:23.004
Larry Trainor. Rita Farr.

13:23.006 --> 13:25.000
Though you probably
recognize her.

13:25.002 --> 13:26.012
[chuckling] Really, Niles.

13:27.008 --> 13:28.009
[Niles sighs]

13:29.002 --> 13:30.002
Come on in, Larry.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.012
[Larry grunting]

13:43.021 --> 13:45.016
[Niles] There we are.

13:45.018 --> 13:48.010
Now, I'm sorry,
but I've lost contact

13:48.012 --> 13:51.016
with a very important
research vessel,

13:51.018 --> 13:53.013
and now the search continues.

13:53.015 --> 13:55.016
You'll be in Rita's
very good hands,

13:55.018 --> 13:58.020
and I've left something
for you in your room.

13:58.022 --> 14:02.010
I hope it'll make you feel
more comfortable.

14:05.023 --> 14:06.022
[Rita clears throat]

14:09.016 --> 14:13.001
Niles tells me you were
an exceptional pilot.

14:13.003 --> 14:15.007
I know a little about flying.

14:15.009 --> 14:18.003
I once played an aviatrix
turned spy

14:18.005 --> 14:21.020
in a picture called
<i>The Spy Who Could Fly.</i>

14:25.000 --> 14:26.007
So... [chuckles]

14:27.003 --> 14:28.002
[Larry] My room?

14:29.014 --> 14:31.014
Oh, just up the stairs.

14:36.006 --> 14:39.009
[Rita muffled] Chief agonized
over every detail.

14:39.011 --> 14:42.010
He wanted your room to feel
as normal as possible

14:42.012 --> 14:45.014
whilst still being
radiation-proof.

14:45.016 --> 14:50.005
He spent months developing
a special film for the windows.

14:50.007 --> 14:53.020
Sunlight is very important
for one's mood, you know.

15:01.001 --> 15:05.001
[Larry] So is not being held
captive by a shadowy
government agency.

15:06.017 --> 15:08.011
Well, you're here now.

15:13.016 --> 15:14.016
[Larry] What's this?

15:14.018 --> 15:16.015
A gift from the Chief.

15:24.009 --> 15:26.016
Those will contain
the radiation.

15:26.018 --> 15:29.017
You'll never have to wear
that lousy suit again.

15:35.022 --> 15:37.020
[Larry] How can that be?

15:37.022 --> 15:39.018
They're as thin
as regular bandages.

15:39.020 --> 15:41.020
Have a little faith in Niles...

15:41.022 --> 15:44.017
because he rarely
explains himself.

15:44.019 --> 15:47.002
But in all my time here,
I've learned

15:47.004 --> 15:49.003
there's a method
to his madness,

15:49.005 --> 15:51.014
and goodness in his heart.

15:51.016 --> 15:55.021
He truly wants this to be
a place where we can heal.

15:58.008 --> 16:01.012
Now, go on.
Get out of that suit.

16:01.014 --> 16:03.014
I'm sure it's awfully heavy.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.022
[air hisses]

16:36.007 --> 16:38.023
-[Larry] Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

16:39.001 --> 16:40.007
I... I can put it back on.

16:40.009 --> 16:41.020
[Rita] No, no, no. Please.

16:41.022 --> 16:42.019
[chuckles]

16:42.021 --> 16:44.015
This is your home, too.

16:44.017 --> 16:46.019
You should
feel comfortable here.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.006
We have to remember,
there's nothing to be
worried about.

16:55.008 --> 16:59.007
This is no different
than any other time
Papa's gone out into the world.

17:00.003 --> 17:02.015
He always comes home.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.020
Always.

17:05.021 --> 17:09.017
And sometimes, if we're lucky,

17:09.019 --> 17:12.012
he brings back presents.

17:12.014 --> 17:14.015
-[shrilly] Ooh! [giggles]
-Yes!

17:14.017 --> 17:16.019
"Ooh" indeed.

17:17.015 --> 17:18.017
Now...

17:19.019 --> 17:22.014
what shall we do
to pass the time?

17:24.004 --> 17:26.008
We could do some drawing.

17:28.009 --> 17:30.007
Or read a story.

17:37.005 --> 17:39.006
Hide-and-go-seek, it is.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.008
One bananana.

17:42.010 --> 17:44.007
Two bananana.

17:44.009 --> 17:47.010
As you guessed,
this is an intervention.

17:47.012 --> 17:49.005
Your face is an intervention.

17:49.007 --> 17:51.014
[Dr. Harrison] Everyone's here
because they care
about you, Jane.

17:51.016 --> 17:54.016
And would like
to express their feelings

17:54.018 --> 17:55.018
about your behavior.

17:55.020 --> 17:57.019
And if I don't wanna listen?

17:57.021 --> 17:58.021
[chainsaw revving]

17:59.023 --> 18:02.016
Okay, let's get this bullshit
over with.

18:03.010 --> 18:05.005
[chainsaw stops]

18:05.007 --> 18:09.003
"Dear Jane, my most
favoritest things to do
are to run and sing.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.023
Uh, but when you take drugs,

18:11.001 --> 18:12.012
I'm too sleepy to do either.

18:12.014 --> 18:15.019
It's not fair that we all
have to feel sleepy

18:15.021 --> 18:17.007
just 'cause you feel sad."

18:17.009 --> 18:18.023
Run and sing?

18:19.017 --> 18:21.019
That's all you do.

18:21.021 --> 18:24.007
And the only shitty song
you seem to know

18:24.009 --> 18:26.001
is "Roar"
by Katy Perry. [scoffs]

18:26.003 --> 18:28.015
If you ask me,
I did us all a favor.

18:28.017 --> 18:30.011
Am I right, Driller?

18:30.013 --> 18:32.001
I find the song empowering.

18:32.003 --> 18:34.009
Makes me feel good
about being a woman.

18:36.005 --> 18:38.007
[Dr. Harrison] There's
a larger point here, Jane.

18:38.009 --> 18:40.006
When you use drugs,

18:40.008 --> 18:42.007
you endanger Kay.

18:42.009 --> 18:46.003
Because it dampens
all of our abilities
to protect her.

18:46.022 --> 18:48.003
[Karen] "Jane...

18:48.005 --> 18:50.004
I made my peace
with your reckless skin,

18:50.006 --> 18:51.022
and haircare regimens long ago.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.009
But what I'm mondo uncool with

18:54.011 --> 18:57.000
is how your recent behavior
affects me.

18:57.002 --> 18:59.020
Like when you decided
to take your walkabout
in the Underground.

18:59.022 --> 19:02.006
That basic robo bitch, Cliff,

19:02.008 --> 19:03.020
stopped me from marrying
my Dougie."

19:03.022 --> 19:06.002
[Karen sobbing]

19:08.019 --> 19:10.010
[wails loudly]

19:13.018 --> 19:15.021
[tires screeching]

19:21.003 --> 19:22.016
[Cliff moans]

19:24.016 --> 19:26.009
[mumbles indistinctly]

19:29.005 --> 19:31.009
[Cliff]
I'm a great fucking father.

19:31.011 --> 19:33.002
Better than that turd
with the beard.

19:33.004 --> 19:34.018
This is gonna be great.

19:36.011 --> 19:38.003
This is a big mistake.

19:38.005 --> 19:40.009
Huge. What was I thinking?

19:40.011 --> 19:42.016
Fucking idiot! No!

19:43.009 --> 19:45.005
No!

19:45.007 --> 19:47.014
You're not a coward.
You know who is?

19:47.016 --> 19:50.017
Niles-shitting-Caulder.
That's who.

19:53.019 --> 19:54.019
[door knob clicks]

19:59.002 --> 20:00.000
Yes?

20:00.002 --> 20:02.014
[Cliff] Hi, uh, you're, um...

20:02.016 --> 20:05.005
Uh, I know you
from Bump's wake.

20:05.007 --> 20:06.018
Right, yeah, uh-huh.

20:06.020 --> 20:09.021
Did one of the girls
send you here as entertainment?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.015
[Cliff] What? No.
[chuckles softly]

20:11.017 --> 20:14.001
I'm not a clown.
I'm your father.

20:15.002 --> 20:16.009
Excuse me?

20:17.003 --> 20:18.015
Okay.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.007
See, some batshit
crazy scientist
caused our car crash

20:20.009 --> 20:22.015
so he could stick my brain
in this piece of shit body.

20:22.017 --> 20:24.022
He told me you were dead
all this time.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.014
Then I found out you weren't.

20:26.016 --> 20:30.006
Now, here I am. Okay? We good?

20:30.008 --> 20:32.020
How we do this? You, uh,
wanna call me "Dad"?

20:32.022 --> 20:34.014
Or call me "Daddy"? Or, uh...

20:34.016 --> 20:36.010
Oh, shit!

20:36.012 --> 20:38.008
Happy belated birthday?

20:39.011 --> 20:40.014
[gasps]

20:41.011 --> 20:44.004
I'm gonna be a grandpa?

20:44.017 --> 20:46.004
This is amazing.

20:46.006 --> 20:48.018
I'm gonna take
that little fucker
to RodentLand.

20:48.020 --> 20:51.016
-I could teach him to drive.
-I don't what your game is,

20:51.018 --> 20:54.016
but I really don't think
it's funny.

20:55.013 --> 20:56.020
What? No.

20:56.022 --> 20:59.017
My watch, I left it
on the bar for you.

20:59.019 --> 21:02.007
I won it at the Dallas Speedway
back in '76.

21:02.009 --> 21:05.006
I had to stick my hand
up this giant alligator
named Francis

21:05.008 --> 21:06.007
to get it back.

21:07.007 --> 21:08.005
I...

21:09.001 --> 21:10.000
Can we...

21:12.004 --> 21:13.017
This is really not a good time
right now.

21:13.019 --> 21:15.007
I'm expecting
a house full of people.

21:15.009 --> 21:17.012
[Cliff] I just drove
a thousand miles to see you

21:17.014 --> 21:20.005
and you can't talk to me
for five goddamn minutes?

21:23.015 --> 21:25.017
I'm sorry.
I can't do this right now.

21:25.019 --> 21:28.003
Fine. I'll fucking wait.

21:40.013 --> 21:42.004
Do you mind if I ask?

21:44.012 --> 21:45.010
Yeah.

21:47.022 --> 21:48.020
Sorry.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.012
So...

21:55.014 --> 21:57.018
Am I the first person--

21:57.020 --> 21:59.007
Girl, please.

21:59.009 --> 22:01.004
I know you ain't trying
to say this is my first time.

22:01.006 --> 22:03.020
Okay, relax, Don Juan.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.012
[both chuckling]

22:05.014 --> 22:09.000
I'm asking
if it's the first time since...

22:10.013 --> 22:11.009
all this.

22:11.011 --> 22:13.004
Yeah.

22:13.006 --> 22:15.022
I came close
with this one girl, but...

22:16.000 --> 22:16.023
I bounced.

22:18.007 --> 22:21.004
But I'm glad
I didn't repeat that mistake.

22:28.010 --> 22:29.005
Well...

22:29.007 --> 22:30.006
[chuckles awkwardly]

22:31.006 --> 22:32.010
This was fun.

22:32.012 --> 22:33.006
"Fun"?

22:33.008 --> 22:34.022
[Roni] I have to...

22:35.000 --> 22:37.013
Come on.
It was a little more than that.

22:37.015 --> 22:39.001
Uh, not really.

22:39.003 --> 22:40.020
-Roni?
-Ugh.

22:40.022 --> 22:43.005
Can you not ruin this
with the whole,
"I really like you,

22:43.007 --> 22:44.022
I think this could
be something," conversation,

22:45.000 --> 22:46.015
and just see it for what it is?

22:46.017 --> 22:49.005
Two fucked up people that are
trying to forget their shit.

22:49.007 --> 22:50.007
I do really like you.

22:50.009 --> 22:52.011
That'll change. It always does.

22:52.013 --> 22:54.006
-I'm not like other guys.
-Ooh.

22:54.008 --> 22:57.000
I've never heard that before.

22:57.002 --> 22:58.003
I'll prove it to you.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.020
-Let me take you out tonight.
-Mmm-mmm.

23:00.022 --> 23:02.006
Look, we'll keep it chill.

23:02.008 --> 23:04.012
-[sighs]
-Have you been to Tino's
in Corktown?

23:04.014 --> 23:08.007
They've got a cheesesteak
that'll make you feel
way better things than I can.

23:08.009 --> 23:10.018
[snickers] That's a low bar.

23:10.020 --> 23:12.000
Look, just give me one shot.

23:12.002 --> 23:13.020
One shot.
That's all I'm asking.

23:16.008 --> 23:20.000
If I say yes, will you get
the hell out of my apartment?

23:23.017 --> 23:25.000
See you at 8:00.

23:28.021 --> 23:30.013
[Driller Bill] <i>"Dear Jane...</i>

23:30.015 --> 23:33.015
Because you decided to remain
in a house with toxic people,

23:33.017 --> 23:36.015
I haven't felt safe enough
to do my drilling,

23:36.017 --> 23:37.022
or my billing.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.022
And May is our busiest month.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.011
Those freak hoes
that you live with

23:41.013 --> 23:43.005
keep dragging you into trouble,

23:43.007 --> 23:45.019
and every time,
you go with them
without thinking twice.

23:45.021 --> 23:48.005
I still have nightmares
about being inside

23:48.007 --> 23:51.017
that gigantic,
evangelical cockroach.

23:51.019 --> 23:55.015
Do you ever think
about how your decisions
affect the rest of us?

23:55.017 --> 23:58.008
Because it doesn't
seem like you do.

23:58.010 --> 24:00.015
Warmest regards, Driller Bill."

24:00.017 --> 24:03.002
Of course I'm going
to fucking help them.

24:04.002 --> 24:05.001
[Secretary] Why?

24:05.019 --> 24:08.003
We're your family, Jane.

24:08.005 --> 24:10.002
And Kay is your responsibility.

24:10.004 --> 24:13.013
Not that other little girl
that you think
needs taking care of.

24:13.015 --> 24:15.017
-Her name is Dorothy.
-[Secretary] Okay.

24:15.019 --> 24:17.007
Dorothy.

24:17.009 --> 24:20.020
You're not saying you consider
those people your family, too?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.002
[scoffs]

24:25.004 --> 24:28.021
You know, this shit
may be cut and dry
for you ding-dongs.

24:28.023 --> 24:29.023
But it's not for me.

24:32.005 --> 24:33.012
Life...

24:33.014 --> 24:36.002
Life up there,
it's... it's messy,

24:36.017 --> 24:38.006
and confusing.

24:42.002 --> 24:45.000
A long time ago,
I would have...

24:45.002 --> 24:48.006
bailed as soon as I found out
what the Chief did to us.

24:49.015 --> 24:51.008
But I think that those...

24:53.011 --> 24:58.004
annoying fuck-ups
that I live with
are my family.

25:01.004 --> 25:03.005
They may be spineless,

25:03.007 --> 25:04.018
and selfish.

25:06.011 --> 25:08.015
But I know deep down,
they all care about me.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.005
Even the Chief.

25:12.007 --> 25:14.009
Until he betrays us again.

25:14.011 --> 25:17.000
Just fuck this pity party!

you accepted my invitation.

Where's Larry?

[chuckling] The foul stench
of compassion

26:26.006 --> 26:27.022
pollutes the very air
around you.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.010
Ah, no matter.

26:29.012 --> 26:31.011
My tutelage shall soon
cleanse you of that quickly.

26:31.013 --> 26:33.022
Tutelage? What is it
you want from me?

26:34.000 --> 26:37.021
After countless centuries,
I'm afraid the pain
of loneliness

26:37.023 --> 26:41.019
has become
somewhat of a bland potage
of my daily consumption.

26:41.021 --> 26:44.016
What I long for now
is an equal.

26:44.018 --> 26:46.005
Someone who...

26:46.007 --> 26:49.016
revels in harvesting the agony
of others as much as I.

26:49.018 --> 26:51.007
I am not your equal.

26:51.009 --> 26:55.001
[laughing]
Of course you're not!

26:55.011 --> 26:56.015
No.

26:56.017 --> 26:59.014
But... by my guiding hand,

26:59.016 --> 27:04.017
within a few short decades,
we could perfect
your prowess for pain.

27:05.011 --> 27:07.008
I, your master,

27:07.010 --> 27:10.018
and you,
my singular apprentice.

27:10.020 --> 27:13.022
-"Decades"?
-Oh, yes, Dr. Caulder.

27:15.002 --> 27:17.009

I don't know what it is
you think you see in me,

27:42.018 --> 27:44.009
but you're wasting your time.

27:44.011 --> 27:47.016
Oh, you made
quite the impression
all those years ago.

27:47.018 --> 27:50.018
I saw something
absolutely wondrous

27:50.020 --> 27:52.011
in that little boy
from the alley.

27:52.013 --> 27:54.023
Was that before or after
you murdered an innocent woman?

27:55.001 --> 27:56.009
Oh, that's just it.

27:56.011 --> 27:59.021
When you came up
on that horrific abomination

27:59.023 --> 28:02.015
in the alley, you did not run.

28:02.017 --> 28:03.023
No, you weren't afraid.

28:04.001 --> 28:06.007
You were fascinated.

28:06.009 --> 28:08.014
Oh, I could feel
the exhilaration

28:08.016 --> 28:10.018
coursing through your veins.

28:10.020 --> 28:14.002
A man that passionate will go
to the greatest of lengths

28:14.004 --> 28:16.007
to satisfy his curiosities.

28:16.009 --> 28:18.012
-No matter the cost.
-You're wrong.

28:18.014 --> 28:19.012
Am I?

28:20.008 --> 28:22.002
Tell me,

28:22.004 --> 28:25.020
when you ruined the lives
of that pathetic pack
of simpletons, [chuckles]

28:25.022 --> 28:27.009
what did their pain taste like?

28:27.011 --> 28:29.022
Dust, and ash.

28:31.013 --> 28:35.014
I did what I had to do
to protect someone I love.

28:35.016 --> 28:40.014
But I wouldn't expect
a soulless parasite like you
to understand that.

28:43.010 --> 28:44.021
Very well.

28:50.017 --> 28:52.012
[Red Jack breathing heavily]

28:53.012 --> 28:56.001

breathing heavily]

28:59.008 --> 29:01.002

Why are you doing this to me?

29:15.021 --> 29:17.017
No! Oh, God!

No, please, God!, no!

[Larry grunting]

29:22.014 --> 29:24.021
I'm sorry! Please, stop!

29:26.021 --> 29:28.003
[grunting]

29:28.005 --> 29:30.000
[old fashioned music
playing over radio]

29:32.013 --> 29:33.013
[knocking on door]

29:33.015 --> 29:34.013
Come in.

29:40.007 --> 29:41.006
[clicks tongue]

29:44.000 --> 29:45.019
[Larry] I look
like Boris Karloff.

29:45.021 --> 29:48.005
You look absolutely stunning.

29:50.007 --> 29:52.011
And the turtleneck,
very debonair.

29:52.013 --> 29:55.015
Will you still talk to me
if I give you
radiation poisoning?

29:55.017 --> 29:57.012
Ugh, pshaw.

29:57.014 --> 30:01.005
If Niles says it's safe for you
to walk around like this,

30:01.007 --> 30:03.005
then you have to trust him.

30:04.020 --> 30:05.018
I do.

30:10.014 --> 30:11.012
Thank you.

30:17.014 --> 30:20.012
I never got a chance
to tell you
what a big fan I am.

30:20.014 --> 30:21.023
Oh?

30:22.001 --> 30:24.007
Yeah, <i>Sweet Desire</i>
is one of my favorite films.

30:24.009 --> 30:27.006
When your husband abandons you,
and you give
that amazing speech

30:27.008 --> 30:29.020
about how you're not
worthy of love...

30:29.022 --> 30:31.014
Chills, every time.

30:31.016 --> 30:34.023
Would you believe
they almost cast Deborah Kerr
instead of me?

30:35.001 --> 30:37.000
[scoffs] What a train wreck
that would have been.

30:37.002 --> 30:40.002
Yeah, your performances,
they... they always had
so much depth.

30:40.004 --> 30:43.005
You were more
than just a pretty face
with a perfect smile.

30:43.007 --> 30:46.001
And I always felt there was
something underneath all that.

30:46.003 --> 30:47.002
What?

30:48.021 --> 30:50.018
Pain.

30:50.020 --> 30:54.001
It was quiet,
and it was very deep.

30:54.003 --> 30:55.018
But I could tell it was there.

30:55.020 --> 30:58.005
And I could tell you had
to hide it from the world.

30:58.007 --> 31:00.015
[scoffing] Well, I'm sure
I don't know what
you're talking about--

31:00.017 --> 31:04.007
Forgive me, I don't mean to be
too familiar. I just...

31:04.009 --> 31:06.019
I know how that feels.
And I wanted to say

31:06.021 --> 31:10.021
that watching you
always made me feel
a little less alone.

31:13.021 --> 31:15.015
Oh, my God.

31:15.017 --> 31:19.001
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
This is just something
that happens on occasion

31:19.003 --> 31:20.014
when my condition flares up.

31:20.016 --> 31:22.010
-Your condition?
-Excuse me.

31:23.012 --> 31:25.005
[door opens and closes]

31:28.021 --> 31:29.020
[siren blares]

31:34.007 --> 31:36.002
[Cliff] What the fucking fuck
is this?

31:41.008 --> 31:44.006
Are you aware this is
private property you're
currently trespassing on?

31:44.008 --> 31:45.011
[Cliff] Trespassing?

31:45.013 --> 31:47.001
Nah, this is
my daughter's place.

31:47.003 --> 31:48.022
-Your daughter Clara Steele?
-[Cliff] Yes, thank you.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.014
That's what I'm saying.
How did...

31:53.010 --> 31:55.008
God damn it!

31:55.010 --> 31:58.019
That's just fucking great!
She spends 30 years thinking
her dear old dad's dead.

31:58.021 --> 32:02.006
And when she find out he's not,
she fucking calls the cops
on him?

32:02.008 --> 32:04.020
-Sir--
-I deserve better
than this shit. You know?

32:04.022 --> 32:07.015
I was a good fucking dad!
Wiped her ass,
cleaned her puke,

32:07.017 --> 32:10.016
bought her every Strawberry
fucking Shortcake doll
that she ever asked for,

32:10.018 --> 32:12.011
and this is the thanks I get?

32:12.013 --> 32:14.010
Listen, buddy, I get it.

32:14.012 --> 32:16.015
My kid's a piece of work, too.
But right now,
she doesn't wanna talk.

32:16.017 --> 32:19.006
So, cool off, and try again
some other time, all right?

32:19.008 --> 32:21.022
[Cliff] Oh, yeah? How's this
for cooling off?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.015
Sir, step away from the bus.

32:24.017 --> 32:29.003
[grunting] Fuck you!
It's my fucking bus.

32:29.005 --> 32:31.022
[Cliff grumbling indistinctly]

32:32.000 --> 32:34.005
-Dude's a giant fucking robot.
-[Cliff] Fuck!

32:34.007 --> 32:36.001
-I mean, it is his fucking bus.
-[Cliff] Damn it!

32:36.003 --> 32:39.000
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

32:39.002 --> 32:41.014
I understand how difficult
that must have been for you.

32:41.016 --> 32:45.005
But try and receive
our criticism in the spirit
in which it was intended.

32:45.007 --> 32:48.008
Oh, you mean the spirit
of a feckless, ungrateful mob

32:48.010 --> 32:50.006
of shit-eating losers?

32:50.008 --> 32:52.002
Yeah, message received.

32:52.004 --> 32:54.000
Don't fucking tell me
how to do my job.

32:54.002 --> 32:56.012
You seem to possess
a very clear understanding
of your mandate

32:56.014 --> 32:57.023
within our little eco-system.

32:58.001 --> 33:00.013
I think it's important
that you articulate it.

33:07.015 --> 33:10.011
I fucking survive...

33:10.013 --> 33:15.019
the tidal wave of bullshit
that hits us every single
fucking day.

33:19.006 --> 33:21.011
I'm the one who deals with it.

33:21.013 --> 33:23.009
When one of you
loses their shit,

33:23.011 --> 33:25.023
I'm the one who has to clean up
their mess afterwards.

33:26.001 --> 33:30.007
When we have to wake up,
and do it all over again,
and again, and again,

33:30.009 --> 33:31.021
I'm the one who bounces back.

33:31.023 --> 33:33.014
[echoing] Who bounces back.

33:33.016 --> 33:35.013
I'm the fucking one...

33:35.015 --> 33:37.013
The fucking primary, not you...

33:38.022 --> 33:41.009
not any of those
other stumblefucks.

33:42.001 --> 33:43.009
Me.

33:43.011 --> 33:45.015
If you'd like to continue
to be "the one,"

33:45.017 --> 33:47.004
as you put it,

33:47.006 --> 33:50.009
then I suggest
you step off that bus,

33:50.011 --> 33:52.001
and never return to that house.

33:52.003 --> 33:53.015
You're giving me an ultimatum.

33:53.017 --> 33:55.001
I don't like that word.

33:55.003 --> 33:57.013
Think of it as a performance
improvement plan.

33:57.015 --> 34:00.007
Listen, I screwed up.
All right?

34:00.009 --> 34:01.017
Is that what you fucking
wanna hear?

34:01.019 --> 34:03.013
I'll be more careful.

34:03.015 --> 34:06.010
I won't touch that serum again.
I... I won't go diving
head first

34:06.012 --> 34:09.022
into every weird
dimensional portal
that comes our way, all right?

34:10.000 --> 34:11.021
This is not
a negotiation, Jane.

34:11.023 --> 34:14.023
Your true addiction
is not the serum.

34:15.001 --> 34:17.016
It's Niles Caulder,
and your friends.

34:17.018 --> 34:19.022
-Merely your enablers.
-That's not true.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.005
There is no half measure
here, Jane.

34:24.005 --> 34:27.019
Leave Niles, or lose your post
as primary.

34:31.007 --> 34:34.008
[Dorothy] Ready or not,
here I come!

34:53.010 --> 34:55.000
[floor scraping]

34:56.006 --> 34:57.006
I heard that.

35:09.022 --> 35:11.011
Nice try, Danny.

35:12.002 --> 35:13.020
You can't fool me.

35:15.001 --> 35:16.017
-[Danny] Boo!
-[gasps]

35:21.002 --> 35:24.005
Oh, fudge!

35:24.007 --> 35:31.002
[Red Jack] <i>A wretched soul,</i>
<i>bruised with adversity, we bid</i>
<i>be quiet when we hear it cry.</i>

35:31.004 --> 35:34.017
But were we burdened
with like weight of pain,

35:34.019 --> 35:38.012
as much, or more
we should ourselves complain?

35:38.014 --> 35:41.022
Do you know what it is
to see with dull eyes?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.008
[Niles straining] What...

35:43.010 --> 35:44.016
are...

35:44.018 --> 35:46.002
you...

35:46.004 --> 35:48.023
To speak with contrived voice?

35:51.015 --> 35:53.015
[Niles] No...

35:53.017 --> 35:57.012
[slowly] What is this?

35:57.014 --> 36:00.012
-To touch with dead hands.
-[Niles yelling]

36:02.012 --> 36:05.010
Abject hopelessness
with subtle hints

36:05.012 --> 36:07.012
of despondent isolation?

36:07.014 --> 36:10.010
[inhales deeply] Scrumptious.

<i>Now you know.</i>

36:16.015 --> 36:19.022
No, no, no! Uh, no.

36:20.019 --> 36:23.020
[Larry grunting] I'm sorry.

36:23.022 --> 36:26.001
-I'm sorry, please get out!
-Larry?

36:26.003 --> 36:29.001
[Larry continues grunting]
Oh, God.

36:29.003 --> 36:30.014
-Larry!
-[banging on door]

36:30.016 --> 36:33.015
-Please, God, Rita, just go!
-I don't know what to do!

36:34.009 --> 36:35.009
Larry!

36:35.011 --> 36:37.015
[breathing heavily]

36:39.020 --> 36:41.018
[crying]

36:41.020 --> 36:43.010
That's enough.

36:43.012 --> 36:45.023
[Red Jack] But it's never
enough, Dr. Caulder.

36:46.001 --> 36:47.003
[cries out]

36:47.023 --> 36:49.022

37:21.018 --> 37:24.005
[mocking] "I know. It doesn't."

37:24.007 --> 37:26.012
Please.

37:26.014 --> 37:31.010
I've seen steadier performances
from a two-legged coatrack.

37:31.012 --> 37:35.017
[Larry] Hmm. I guess
that's why she only got
six Oscar nominations.

37:37.004 --> 37:38.003
But never won.

37:38.005 --> 37:40.004
It should've been me.

37:40.006 --> 37:43.002
If it wasn't
for my unfortunate...

37:43.004 --> 37:43.023
incident,

37:44.001 --> 37:46.001
it would have been.

37:48.013 --> 37:52.023
Niles told me
he was helping other people
with their own conditions.

37:53.001 --> 37:56.013
I just never imagined
anyone could have it
as bad as me.

37:58.023 --> 38:00.019
I'm sorry for how
I reacted earlier.

38:00.021 --> 38:01.020
[Rita] It's quite all right.

38:01.022 --> 38:03.006
I've gotten used to it.

38:03.008 --> 38:05.023
[Larry] You shouldn't have
to get used to it.

38:06.001 --> 38:08.003
Like you said,
this is your home.

38:08.005 --> 38:09.015
You should feel comfortable.

38:09.017 --> 38:11.017
[sighs] Oh, I'm comfortable.

38:12.009 --> 38:13.017
However...

38:13.019 --> 38:16.004
I'm afraid I'm becoming
a bit too comfortable

38:16.006 --> 38:17.015
with the monster in the mirror.

38:19.022 --> 38:21.023
Early signs of a lost cause.

38:22.001 --> 38:24.006
[Larry] I don't think
that's true.

38:24.008 --> 38:25.023
And if it is, then...

38:28.010 --> 38:30.008
Let's be lost causes together.

You could have transformed
into something truly exquisite.

Something divine.

Ah, the black fire
works inside.

39:49.016 --> 39:53.003
Ah, the dark comes on in wait.

39:53.005 --> 39:54.018
And wind...

39:54.020 --> 39:56.018
Oh, such a wind.

have been us, too.

[Cliff] Couldn't just be easy,
could it? No.

40:45.015 --> 40:47.009
Couldn't just be,
"Oh, hey, Dad.

40:47.011 --> 40:50.015
I missed you. I can't believe
you're still alive
all this time!

40:50.017 --> 40:55.007
Cool robot body. Come on in.
Have a beer. We'll catch up."

I can't believe
I'm gonna have a grandkid.

I gonna fucking miss out
on that, too.

It's just not fucking fair.

41:21.014 --> 41:23.008
It's not fair, Jane.

41:23.010 --> 41:26.000
I know I wasn't
the perfect dad,
but I did the best I could.

41:26.002 --> 41:29.001
And this, all this,
it wasn't my fault.

41:30.016 --> 41:31.022
You're right.

41:32.022 --> 41:33.021
It wasn't.

41:36.006 --> 41:37.005
But this...

41:38.013 --> 41:39.011
This is.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.022
[Cliff] Shit.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.022
I completely fucked up,
didn't I?

41:55.000 --> 41:56.010
Yeah, dude.

41:56.012 --> 41:57.011
[Cliff sighs]

41:58.004 --> 41:59.003
We both did.

42:01.009 --> 42:03.000
[Cliff] Listen,
let's get out of here.

42:10.019 --> 42:12.003
[Cliff] You coming?

[Dorothy sobbing]

42:24.011 --> 42:26.014
Please be okay.

42:27.020 --> 42:29.002
Don't cry, darling.

42:32.005 --> 42:34.010
-Oh...

42:45.012 --> 42:47.005
Look what I did.

42:49.005 --> 42:51.003
Am I bad a person?

42:51.005 --> 42:52.003
No.

42:53.004 --> 42:55.011
We all make mistakes.

42:55.013 --> 42:59.010
The important thing to remember
is they don't define
who we are.

42:59.012 --> 43:02.010
I said I was sorry.

43:02.012 --> 43:04.023
But I don't think that
made it any better.

43:05.001 --> 43:06.011
Sometimes...

43:06.013 --> 43:08.004
when you make
a very big mistake,

43:08.006 --> 43:11.005
you have to do more
than just apologize.

43:11.019 --> 43:12.021
Like what?

43:12.023 --> 43:14.013
You must try to fix it.

43:14.015 --> 43:16.010
What if I can't?
