14:42.600 --> 14:46.960
For Christmas, I got an acoustic kit,
and I remember, like,

14:47.040 --> 14:50.480
falling against the wall
because I was so overwhelmed

14:50.560 --> 14:54.720

Like, this was it.

14:54.840 --> 14:58.840
I mean, it was like giving me
a lifetime supply of gold

14:58.960 --> 15:00.840
or… I don't know, it was just like,

15:01.080 --> 15:04.280
this is the most incredible
moment of my life.

15:09.520 --> 15:12.120
It was a sign,
that my parents were going,

15:12.200 --> 15:14.280
"We believe you can do this, too."

15:17.640 --> 15:20.320
But what that meant was
I could go and do live gigs.

15:20.640 --> 15:23.040
That was the big thing
about having my own drum kit.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.720

15:24.800 --> 15:26.400
"I could be a professional now."

15:38.360 --> 15:41.080
So my father would sit down
and show me a beat.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.560
I'd play it and then he would
pick up the bass and we'd jam.

15:44.960 --> 15:48.440

17:31.880 --> 17:33.600
Of course, I started playing the drums,

17:33.720 --> 17:37.360
and by the time I realised
that drummers sat at the back

17:37.440 --> 17:39.560
and just kept the beat,
it was a bit too late.

17:39.640 --> 17:43.280

18:20.120 --> 18:23.680
and there was a band in the school
as well, The Black Knights.

18:24.120 --> 18:27.320
So Ian, obviously, as the coolest guy
in Beirut,

18:27.400 --> 18:31.680
should be the drummer in the band.
So Ian had the drums in his bedroom

18:32.080 --> 18:33.600
and he was trying to figure them out.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.440
But he couldn't really,
and when he would leave,

18:36.960 --> 18:40.680
I would sneak into his room
on pain of death.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.680
I would sneak into his room

18:43.800 --> 18:45.960

I picked up my dad's sticks
and I got my sister in,

18:57.520 --> 19:00.880
and I told her to bring a spoon in,
a tablespoon.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.440
So she brought the spoon in.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.720

19:22.200 --> 19:24.800
I had a neighbour named Kent Kleeder

19:25.160 --> 19:30.760
who had a drum set, a really bad drum set.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.800

"Sit on this drum set, Taylor."

and that's called a kick drum."

Well, my dad was a drummer
and I didn't want to play drums

20:54.320 --> 20:56.320
'cause I was like,
"I want to be different and unique."

20:56.400 --> 20:58.000
"I don't wanna be the drummer as well."

20:58.080 --> 21:01.520
So, uh, my dad was like,
"I'll buy you a guitar

21:01.600 --> 21:04.680
if you play drums
for just a year in the school band."

21:05.040 --> 21:06.560

28:29.160 --> 28:33.800
Playing in most rock situations
or in pop rock situations,

28:34.120 --> 28:38.240
um, the goal is to play a groove.

28:44.360 --> 28:47.760
There's a beauty in that,
to being able to lay down something

28:47.840 --> 28:52.240
that just feels great, you know,
and allows the music to float.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.200
♪ <i>I want to get away ♪</i>

28:56.760 --> 29:01.840
♪ <i>I want to fly away</i>
<i>Yeah ♪</i>

29:01.920 --> 29:03.760
And it makes people want to dance.

29:03.840 --> 29:04.840
You know, you play a nice…

29:05.600 --> 29:08.800
[scatting]

29:12.000 --> 29:14.280
It's going to make somebody
feel a certain way.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.360
You know, when
somebody starts tapping their foot,

29:16.440 --> 29:17.960
you know you're in there.

29:18.080 --> 29:21.360
The difference between playing that
and playing jazz…

29:21.440 --> 29:24.960
[mimics soft drum playing]

29:26.760 --> 29:28.320
You know, you want that to feel good.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.800
Until rock 'n' roll came along

29:29.920 --> 29:32.080
in the '50s, very, very few
pieces of popular music

29:32.200 --> 29:34.400
had a straight eight…
[mimics drum beating]

29:34.480 --> 29:36.480
It was all… [scatting]

29:36.560 --> 29:38.680
So everything I heard had that in it.

29:38.840 --> 29:40.120
And when I started to play,

29:40.360 --> 29:43.880
even if the basis of the song
was [mimics beat],

29:43.960 --> 29:48.160
in my head I'd still be feeling,
where does the swing come in it?

29:48.360 --> 29:51.640
And even if I wasn't playing
the note, I'd be thinking it.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.320
[mouthing]

30:19.720 --> 30:21.640
The sort of grace note.

30:21.760 --> 30:25.760
Grace note is a tiny little
touch on the drum,

30:25.840 --> 30:27.800
which influences the next note.

30:28.680 --> 30:31.360
And without that, the feel
you're trying to achieve

30:31.440 --> 30:34.760
is impossible because all you
end up hearing is "do, da, do, da."

30:34.840 --> 30:39.760
But you get… [mimics beat]
That little… changes everything.

30:40.880 --> 30:44.120
And sometimes you don't have to play them,
but you got to think them.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.840
[man] One of the remarkable things
about your playing

30:45.920 --> 30:47.480
is the way you manage
to get a kind of dialogue

30:47.560 --> 30:48.960
going between your feet and your hands.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.680
Not only are your feet each playing
different rhythms,

30:50.760 --> 30:51.760
but so are your hands.

30:51.840 --> 30:54.640
And that, of course, doesn't account for
cymbals, it's like a one-man orchestra.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.160
Yeah, you can get good tings on a cymbal.

30:58.880 --> 31:01.600
Can you give us an example
of this kind of instrumental conversation?

31:21.440 --> 31:27.280
The great Ginger Baker,
who is a jazz drummer

31:27.400 --> 31:30.040
trapped in a rock man's body.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.600
When I saw Ginger Baker
with his double bass drums

31:41.680 --> 31:46.000
and right in the middle
and playing, I think, "N.S.U."

31:46.400 --> 31:49.880
and just thinking, "Now
that is what I'd like to be."

31:50.760 --> 31:51.880
<i>He wasn't at the back.</i>

31:51.960 --> 31:53.920
<i>He was actually part of the band</i>

31:54.000 --> 31:57.800
<i>and actually interacting</i>
<i>with Jack or Eric, or whatever.</i>

31:58.360 --> 32:04.960
It was a very different dynamic to Ringo
being 15 feet behind on a riser.

32:10.560 --> 32:15.480
[Paice] <i>He was an amazing</i>
<i>Jazz bebop fusion-type drummer.</i>

32:16.160 --> 32:18.280
<i>When Cream came along,</i>
<i>he just changed it all round.</i>

32:18.680 --> 32:20.360
It's like they said, "Okay,
that's enough of that.

32:20.440 --> 32:21.440
I'm going to do this now."

32:24.960 --> 32:27.360
And when you hear Ginger
playing with Cream…

32:27.440 --> 32:29.640
[mimics beat]

32:29.720 --> 32:32.400
…all of a sudden,
it's not that jazzy thing any more.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.280
He's made a new statement
in rock 'n' roll.

32:46.880 --> 32:49.560
-[man] Ginger Baker on drums!
-[crowd cheering]

32:53.280 --> 32:54.680
[Maloney] <i>I don't care about Ringo.</i>

32:54.800 --> 32:56.120
I don't care about Charlie.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.280
I'm sorry.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.720
It's all about John Bonham.

33:06.960 --> 33:07.880
Led Zeppelin.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.840
Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin, that's it.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.480
What is that?

33:17.360 --> 33:19.040
Check this shit out, motherfucker!

33:19.440 --> 33:22.280
Every drummer in America in 1975

33:22.440 --> 33:26.360
wanted to sound like John Bonham,
because he was the best.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.520
<i>He got the best drum sound.</i>

33:28.960 --> 33:30.640
His drums were tuned the best.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.440
<i>He was in the biggest band,</i>
<i>he was the best.</i>

33:39.800 --> 33:42.960
[Smith] <i>You got to remember,</i>
<i>Robert Plant and Bonham were, like,</i>

33:43.040 --> 33:45.920
<i>19 or 20 when they joined the band.</i>
<i>Something like that.</i>

33:46.000 --> 33:47.480
Like, that's young, man.

33:47.560 --> 33:50.560
And here's a guy who comes out

33:50.640 --> 33:54.600
a fully realised musician,
like the first Zeppelin album,

33:55.280 --> 33:56.800
he's doing his doubles.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.840
The first song, "Good Times, Bad Times."

33:58.920 --> 34:03.240
He's doing his John Bonham thing
from the very get-go.

34:04.040 --> 34:06.880
[Taylor] <i>I think Freddie saw them</i>
<i>at the Marquee before I did,</i>

34:06.960 --> 34:09.600
<i>and then he said, "Well, come on, you've</i>
<i>got to see this band, they're great."</i>

34:09.679 --> 34:12.400
We went to the Lyceum in the Strand.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.639
They sort of shuffled on,

34:14.760 --> 34:17.679
and Bonzo just sort of did
a little warm-up.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.320
And we both sort of… Wow!

34:20.840 --> 34:23.880
You know, most drummers
didn't sound like that.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.760
Tremendous power and speed.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.679
And he was technically brilliant.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.880
[Keltner] <i>I didn't know</i>
<i>what Led Zeppelin was.</i>

34:53.320 --> 34:57.000
We were kind of tripping backstage
and I tapped on the bass drum,

34:57.080 --> 35:01.160
Bonham's bass drum,
and it just went "boing!"

35:01.360 --> 35:03.480
Like, what?
Like, there was no…

35:03.560 --> 35:07.400
Like, my bass drum was, you know,
Hollywood recording ready

35:07.480 --> 35:09.760
with the blanket in it
and the front head off,

35:10.240 --> 35:12.360
and his was just exactly the opposite.

35:12.440 --> 35:15.120
Both heads on, nothing inside.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.160
You could tell, it just went "boing!"

35:23.560 --> 35:27.000
And I said, "Maybe it's kind of like
a Salvation Army kind of thing."

35:27.080 --> 35:31.200
You know, I was thinking, like, maybe some
big marching bass drum kind of sound.

35:36.360 --> 35:40.200
That night, to watch them was incredible.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.720
[Maloney]<i> I had a rough childhood,</i>

35:47.960 --> 35:50.400
<i>and I think that as a girl,</i>
<i>like, you're supposed</i>

35:50.480 --> 35:52.320
<i>to keep your feelings in or whatever.</i>

35:53.080 --> 35:56.320
But for me, I got behind the drum set

35:56.400 --> 35:59.000
and I beat the shit out of it,
and it was my release.

35:59.080 --> 36:02.760
I wanted to take
the beater of the kick drum

36:02.840 --> 36:08.160
and just smash it through and just
crack my snare as hard as I could.

36:08.240 --> 36:11.760
And that's what I
could learn along to Bonham's playing.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.520
<i>Everything you need to know as a drummer,</i>

36:15.600 --> 36:18.920
<i>just listen to Led Zeppelin</i>
<i>and you'll learn it.</i>

36:23.840 --> 36:26.400
[Hawkins] When you're that age,
fifth grade,

36:26.680 --> 36:30.400
you need something to kind of
hang your hat on.

36:30.680 --> 36:33.760
If you're not a great athlete
or you're not, like…

36:33.840 --> 36:36.680
the best-looking kid
in the world or whatever,

36:36.760 --> 36:37.880
you need something.

36:37.960 --> 36:41.960
And once I found drums,
it kind of became my coat of armour.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.800
We started playing these clubs in Detroit,

36:50.880 --> 36:54.040
and we would play three sets a night,
six nights a week,

36:54.520 --> 36:56.520
and it was like,

36:57.400 --> 37:02.080
"This is it, I've made it.
This is the greatest thing ever."

37:02.160 --> 37:06.160
I'm walking around in my bare feet
in these, you know,

37:06.240 --> 37:10.520
beer-soaked clubs in Detroit
and playing music, and girls,

37:10.600 --> 37:12.960
and everything that went with that,

37:13.040 --> 37:15.880
and it was like,
"Wow, this is really something."

37:15.960 --> 37:21.000
"I'm a professional musician,
making $165 a week." [chuckles]

37:21.080 --> 37:25.240
But I was doing what I wanted to do,
what I loved.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.440
I got paid 20 quid
to be in the house band

37:27.520 --> 37:31.680
when I was like 14, and I was like,
"I'm a professional!" [chuckles]

37:32.800 --> 37:34.280
<i>That was the overriding feeling.</i>

37:34.360 --> 37:38.640
<i>It was like, "I'm doing it.</i>
<i>And I'm…" It just felt right.</i>

37:38.720 --> 37:39.920
I was… I was…

37:40.000 --> 37:44.760
I was on my path and I was heading
exactly where I wanted to go.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.280
Telling your parents
you want to drop out of college

37:47.360 --> 37:50.720
to be in a rock band
and tour with a bunch of boys,

37:50.800 --> 37:52.880
my parents were a little bit
iffy about that.

37:54.360 --> 37:55.720
<i>It was funny. They gave me a year.</i>

37:55.920 --> 37:58.680
<i>They said, "We'll give you a year</i>
<i>to do that, and then, you know,</i>

37:58.760 --> 38:01.040
<i>go back to school</i>
<i>and go back to your plan."</i>

38:07.280 --> 38:11.800
The first tour we did, our parents closing
that van door. It was a 15-passenger van,

38:11.880 --> 38:15.400
they closed it for us and they're all
in their driveway waving at us.

38:15.520 --> 38:18.560
And I remember we all looked around,
we were like, "Are we really doing this?"

38:18.640 --> 38:21.120
We were so excited, no parents with us,
you know what I mean?

38:21.200 --> 38:25.160
It was just a bunch of 18-year-olds
in a van travelling around the US.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.720
<i>You know, I was playing music every night.</i>

38:34.040 --> 38:35.280
<i>We weren't making any money.</i>

38:35.400 --> 38:37.040
<i>We were sleeping on people's floors.</i>

38:37.120 --> 38:40.400
<i>If we couldn't sleep on people's floors,</i>
<i>we would just sleep in the van.</i>

38:42.040 --> 38:43.280
[singing]

38:44.840 --> 38:48.560
<i>You know, I think I was just so happy</i>
<i>to be doing what other people,</i>

38:48.640 --> 38:50.520
<i>I think, had always, like,</i>
<i>dreamed of doing.</i>

39:01.440 --> 39:04.160
[Taylor] The dream was, you know,
to achieve success in America.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.720
So you go there, all very wide-eyed

39:06.800 --> 39:11.400
and everything's very big
and the distances are huge.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.320
The touring really was hard work.

39:15.760 --> 39:19.320
[Hawkins] I mean, there was the
lightning bolt at Kent Kleeder's house.

39:19.520 --> 39:23.640
The second thing, a couple months later,
was the Queen concert.

39:32.240 --> 39:35.440
[Perkins] My first concert ever was Queen,

39:35.520 --> 39:39.760
and Roger Taylor was like
a garage punk rock drummer

39:40.640 --> 39:43.920
in this glorious orchestral band.

39:44.520 --> 39:47.720
And his parts were orchestral,
but his attitude was just…

39:59.240 --> 40:03.320
That was my first experience
of seeing a band, and I still feel it,

40:03.400 --> 40:04.880
smell it, taste it, hear it.

40:11.480 --> 40:12.640
[Hawkins]<i> And Roger Taylor,</i>

40:12.720 --> 40:16.160
<i>he played the whole drum set, like,</i>
<i>it was kind of like an orchestra.</i>

40:16.240 --> 40:19.440
<i>He played such perfect parts for songs,</i>

40:19.600 --> 40:21.960
<i>but yet would let you know</i>
<i>he's there, too.</i>

40:22.200 --> 40:24.560
It wasn't just timekeeping.

40:24.840 --> 40:30.240
Every once in a while, some flashy,
perfectly placed fill would happen.

40:44.520 --> 40:46.240
That to me was like, that's how you…

40:46.360 --> 40:48.600
That's an arena band,
that's what you want to be.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.920
[audience cheering]

41:03.920 --> 41:07.760
In the first half, we saw how rock stars
have become more and more distant

41:07.840 --> 41:12.920
from their audiences. Some are tax exiles
and live abroad in California or Europe.

41:13.200 --> 41:17.640
Others only appear on stage
in vast stadiums where tickets cost plenty

41:17.840 --> 41:20.240
and they appear as small dots
on the horizon.

41:30.680 --> 41:33.800
All the people in punk bands,
we didn't really have a choice.

41:42.120 --> 41:45.840
We weren't ever going to be
in a prog rock band.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.880
We weren't ever going to be able to play

41:48.200 --> 41:51.880
sophisticated time signatures
and have flute solos,

41:51.960 --> 41:54.120

That's what felt good.

42:06.280 --> 42:09.320
It was something with adrenaline,
you know, rush.

42:09.520 --> 42:13.000

"Oh, I'm tearing every note from my soul.

42:37.880 --> 42:40.240
Oh, I'm in tears." And I'm gonna go…

If I came off stage
with half an ounce of energy,

42:52.640 --> 42:53.520
it was a poor gig.

42:53.600 --> 42:57.200
It was play as fast as you could,

it's real discipline.

You don't jam, you know, you play your
part and you work hard to write that part.

43:25.240 --> 43:27.520
And you work hard to have
the endurance so you can play it.

43:27.680 --> 43:30.240
The four of us would come off

44:15.120 --> 44:19.640
because if you try and imagine a group
and the drummer is falling apart,

44:19.920 --> 44:23.120

44:38.120 --> 44:40.640
I realised they sat like this
and they played the hi-hat.

44:41.120 --> 44:45.240
You know, if you've got a brain,
it's quite easy to figure it all out.

44:45.520 --> 44:48.120
Then I'd buy an album,
and I'd know they sat like that,

44:48.200 --> 44:50.000
and I'd listen to it and I'd copy it.

44:50.120 --> 44:55.240
Finding someone who not only had the chops
but the strength and the stamina to do it,

44:56.040 --> 44:59.280
was just the breakthrough for us.
If we hadn't have found Topper Headon,

44:59.360 --> 45:03.120
we'd have never, ever got anywhere.

45:05.880 --> 45:10.280
Every now and then,
even punks on amyl nitrate got to chill.

45:10.960 --> 45:14.640
There's only… Sniffing glue
will only get you so far

45:14.720 --> 45:18.440
into the evening.
And, so they gotta chill.

45:18.520 --> 45:21.600
But there's no chill punk music,
'cause it ain't punk if it's chill.

45:22.560 --> 45:25.760
<i>But Don Letts, the DJ of the time,</i>

45:25.840 --> 45:29.800
<i>figured out that dub reggae</i>
<i>would fit the bill perfectly.</i>

45:29.880 --> 45:32.080
<i>It's hostile, it's dark.</i>

45:32.280 --> 45:35.560
It's really pissed off, but chill.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.480
<i>And it was The Clash,</i>
<i>credit must be given,</i>

45:41.560 --> 45:43.280
<i>who first had the inkling of an idea.</i>

45:43.360 --> 45:46.680
<i>"Hey, why don't us white boys</i>
<i>try to play some of that?"</i>

45:47.280 --> 45:50.320
[Perkins] And as the things progressed
and the music started to get

45:50.400 --> 45:56.120
a little more dynamic, you really heard
the drummer become more aware

45:56.200 --> 46:02.120
of this Jamaican, African drumbeats
that he was throwing in.

46:02.200 --> 46:03.840
It was organic. Nothing was…

46:03.920 --> 46:06.080
Nothing was contrived or planned.

46:06.480 --> 46:08.720
As I played with the group
and we started rehearsing

46:08.840 --> 46:12.480
some more numbers,
a few funk influences crept in.

46:12.560 --> 46:16.840
Er… "(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais."
[mimics beat] Came in as a fill.

46:16.920 --> 46:21.240
A few other bits and pieces.
We went and saw Taj Mahal at the…

46:21.320 --> 46:23.520
I think it was
at the Venue in Victoria.

46:24.040 --> 46:27.960
And I nicked a few bits off Taj Mahal.
It just became like a melting pot.

46:28.040 --> 46:31.440
Like, my philosophy of drumming
became the philosophy,

46:31.960 --> 46:33.400
or was the philosophy of The Clash.

46:33.520 --> 46:36.440
I'm not saying I made it, it just
became the philosophy of The Clash.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.080
We'd try and play everything.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.240
I had been listening
to a lot of reggae anyway,

46:40.320 --> 46:41.880
and was already trying to figure out

46:42.000 --> 46:46.560
that it's totally wrong, the way that
that guy… drummer is doing on the drums.

46:46.760 --> 46:48.440
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

46:48.560 --> 46:51.360
No, no! But it's kinda right.

46:51.840 --> 46:54.280
And so figuring out
that you play the backbeat

46:54.360 --> 46:56.960
and the downbeat at the same time…

46:57.280 --> 47:01.160
Well, what are the other beats for?
You listen again and check it out.

47:01.240 --> 47:02.960
Geez, really? Really?

47:05.320 --> 47:07.520
<i>And it's hard to do on your own</i>
<i>because it doesn't work,</i>

47:07.800 --> 47:09.760
<i>unless the uptick is there on the guitar.</i>

47:15.880 --> 47:21.560
You know, it's very much his personality,
and then there's a great unconventionality

47:21.640 --> 47:26.600
to how, where he places the beats. You can
hear the world, the global influence.

47:26.680 --> 47:29.200
You can hear the areas that he grew up in

47:29.280 --> 47:32.080
in the way he plays,
the way he offsets the beat,

47:32.560 --> 47:35.360
the way he accents things,
the way he doesn't always have

47:35.440 --> 47:38.360
to rely on playing two and four again.

47:38.440 --> 47:41.600
And I think, again,
it's inspired by the melody

47:41.680 --> 47:43.640
and the bass and guitar lines.

47:43.720 --> 47:48.080
And he's… You can tell
he's equal with the variations

47:48.160 --> 47:50.520
that the other guys in the band play.

48:03.200 --> 48:05.960
And he was always just
turning the beat around,

48:06.800 --> 48:10.360
and putting stuff on upbeats
and doing…

48:10.480 --> 48:13.560
And constantly surprising you
throughout a pop song.

48:13.680 --> 48:15.400
Throwing fireworks.

48:15.720 --> 48:17.680
That's really what he was doing, you know?

48:18.640 --> 48:19.520
You hear 'em

48:19.600 --> 48:22.080
and you see 'em go out,
but they don't blow exactly

48:22.160 --> 48:24.160
when you think they're gonna, you know?

48:25.080 --> 48:26.880
And then they blow.
And then another one blows

48:26.960 --> 48:28.600
a little later and then a third one.

48:28.960 --> 48:31.760
He's very…unpredictable.

48:35.160 --> 48:36.240
<i>And that's really hard</i>

48:36.320 --> 48:40.720
<i>as a drummer, because people feel</i>
<i>comfortable when they can predict</i>

48:40.800 --> 48:43.360

<i>and it's repetitive.</i>

48:44.040 --> 48:47.280

Let's talk about events.

49:08.600 --> 49:11.440
Keith Moon has many events in his playing,

49:11.760 --> 49:16.040
and he takes cues from the music,
from the lyrics, from the topic.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.080
The subject matter.

49:17.640 --> 49:22.000
And so he is this orchestral drummer
with great chops,

49:22.360 --> 49:24.840
and he picks and chooses
these events to happen.

49:25.320 --> 49:26.640
And people, when they hear Moon,

49:26.720 --> 49:30.320
they think maybe it's just chaos
and he's all over the place.

49:30.480 --> 49:34.400
And if you'd listen to this track, he's
got different themes, different ideas.

49:34.960 --> 49:38.640
And he uses them
and takes the song to another level.

49:38.840 --> 49:41.640

50:01.600 --> 50:06.040

51:03.640 --> 51:06.080

51:07.840 --> 51:10.080
So I love the challenge of the song

51:10.160 --> 51:12.800
because of these great themes,
we have the hi-hat intro,

51:13.120 --> 51:15.800
the pocket verse with the big fills,

51:15.920 --> 51:20.520

to all the songs notating them.

"Hell, no.

1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:33.240
[indistinct chatter]

1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:52.280
[indistinct chatter, laughing]

1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:03.960
[imperceptible]

1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:11.600
[drums beating]

1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:43.800
[Smith] And I look forward to just trying
to continue to be better

1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:45.640
and a better bandmate,
a better musician,

1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:49.880
a better songwriter, uh, and just
play as well as I can all the time.

1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:52.400
And I fucking love it and it's fun.

1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:54.920
Playing the drums is fun.

1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:56.320
[mimics drum beating]

[mimics drum beating]

1:15:11.560 --> 1:15:15.160
[Blackman Santana] And I can play my drums
all day, all night and I love it.

1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:20.920
You know, I don't know if that's
a fault… [laughs] I'm not really sure.

1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:22.920
I've gotten into a little
bit of trouble with that,

1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:24.240
you know, over the years.

1:15:25.200 --> 1:15:26.760
[Davies] I'm from North London.

1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:29.000
I didn't grow up with anything, really,

1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:32.840
apart from just this mad sort of,
like, obsession and love.

1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:36.120
[Headon] The best thing
about being a drummer

1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:39.000
is I saw the world doing the job I love.

1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:40.280
You can't get better than that.

1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:43.560
[Maloney] It's the best feeling
in the world.

1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:47.440
I'm controlling the way this crowd
is moving, it's just me

1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:49.600
and 80,000 people in the stadium.

1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:53.880
And this is the coolest
fucking time of my life.

1:15:55.280 --> 1:15:58.200
[Perkins] If the guitar plug goes out
during a Rage show,

1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:01.240
it would be a bummer, but if
the kick drum pedal breaks,

1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:02.240
that's a problem.

1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:05.520
You have 100,000 people, like,
"Now what?" You know?

1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:12.400
[Bowen] I don't know what my life
would be without drums.

1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:15.600
Everything that has come along
with me playing drums

1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:18.880
has been so rewarding,
I would never trade any of it.

1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:32.800
[Perkins] <i>You feel like you're connecting</i>
<i>with people, you don't know them,</i>

1:16:33.160 --> 1:16:37.120
<i>and you feel like you can raise</i>
<i>the level of happiness.</i>

1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:45.840
That's my thrill, is to inspire
more people to be creative.

1:16:51.600 --> 1:16:55.560
Just play music because you love it.
And dream big.

1:16:56.840 --> 1:17:00.000
And if it happens, fucking A, man.

1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:05.480
