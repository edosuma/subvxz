09:26.043 --> 09:27.349
[ phone rings]

09:27.479 --> 09:29.220
Mayor here. What's that?

09:29.350 --> 09:32.572
A horrible crime in the works?
Ruthless villain?

09:32.701 --> 09:34.138
Citizens in danger?

09:34.269 --> 09:36.532
That's fantastic news!

09:36.663 --> 09:39.840
Because I get to summon
The New Justice Team!

09:39.970 --> 09:40.710
[ beeps]

09:40.841 --> 09:41.624
Oh!

09:41.754 --> 09:43.756
[ buzzing]
Shh.

09:43.886 --> 09:45.759
Huh... They're usually here
by now.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.934
Well, so long.
Keep in touch.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.284
Wait, stay and meet
the superheroes.

09:50.414 --> 09:52.243
There's three of you
and three of them

09:52.374 --> 09:53.504
so it'll be perfect.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.725
[ beeping]
[ buzzing]

09:55.855 --> 09:57.683
[ beeping and buzzing]

09:57.813 --> 09:58.859
Is this clown on?

09:58.989 --> 10:01.557
Where are
those daring crime-stoppers?

10:01.687 --> 10:03.820
Oh, I completely forgot--

10:03.951 --> 10:06.256
I left my apartment
on fire.

10:06.388 --> 10:10.566
As for me, I'm late
for my LSATs.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.787
And I can't take life
any more!

10:13.917 --> 10:15.352
[ grunts]

10:15.484 --> 10:16.745
[ glass shattering]

10:16.876 --> 10:18.618
[ grunting]

10:18.748 --> 10:21.750
Clobberella!
Captain Yesterday! My liege!

10:21.881 --> 10:23.666
You're just in time.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.145
We've received a tip

10:25.275 --> 10:27.538
that the Museum
of Natural History

10:27.669 --> 10:30.542
will be robbed tomorrow
at exactly 9:00 a.m.

10:30.673 --> 10:33.980
The target-- the priceless
Quantum Gemerald.

10:34.110 --> 10:34.894
Who's the perp?

10:35.024 --> 10:36.374
A dangerous villain

10:36.504 --> 10:39.072
known as the Zookeeper,
who commits crimes

10:39.202 --> 10:41.683
aided by a pack
of highly trained animals.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.686
Pack of highly. Got it.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.210
His crew includes a badger
with a troubled past

10:46.341 --> 10:47.734
and nothing left to lose

10:47.864 --> 10:49.778
an elephant who never forgets...
to kill

10:49.909 --> 10:56.917
and a seldom-used crab named
Lucky, AKA, "Citizen Snips."

10:58.091 --> 11:02.399
You can count on us, Mr. Mayor.
Justice away!

11:03.793 --> 11:06.708
[ panting]:
Hold the elevator!

11:13.585 --> 11:17.110
[ flushing]

11:17.240 --> 11:18.373
We're in here, too.

11:18.503 --> 11:19.417
Uh, Leela,
how are you

11:19.548 --> 11:21.115
going to meet
your folks tomorrow?

11:21.245 --> 11:22.985
We've already scheduled
the Zookeeper

11:23.116 --> 11:24.945
for a 9:00 a.m. foiling
at the museum.

11:25.075 --> 11:25.946
Not a problem.

11:26.076 --> 11:27.337
I've cleverly arranged

11:27.469 --> 11:28.991
to meet my parents right there

11:29.123 --> 11:30.864
at the same museum at 10:00.

11:30.994 --> 11:34.780
Nine, ten, a big fat hen.

11:34.911 --> 11:35.825
[ exhales]

11:35.956 --> 11:37.740
The name's Bender.

11:48.010 --> 11:52.145
[ high-pitched whirring]

11:52.275 --> 11:54.713
I can't believe the
Zookeeper is this late

11:54.844 --> 11:55.889
for his own heist.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.586
It's just... rude.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.066
[ clock chimes]

11:59.196 --> 12:01.284
Total hell--
it's 10:00!

12:01.416 --> 12:03.157
I'm supposed to
meet my parents

12:03.287 --> 12:04.811
and I'm still in
my secret costume.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.072
[ gasps]

12:06.202 --> 12:09.510
There they are!

12:09.640 --> 12:11.513
How could Leela
not be here?

12:11.643 --> 12:13.080
Do you think
she forgot?

12:13.210 --> 12:16.082
Relax-- I'm sure
she's just ashamed of us.

12:16.212 --> 12:17.301
Yo, freakjobs--

12:17.432 --> 12:19.739
hit the nearest
manhole, pronto-like.

12:19.869 --> 12:23.264
B-but we have passes
that allow us to be up here--

12:23.394 --> 12:24.961
from the Mayor himself.

12:25.091 --> 12:28.748
I don't know. I never
heard of no mayor.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.966
[ panting and grunting]

12:31.097 --> 12:32.316
The Zookeeper!

12:32.447 --> 12:35.711
Sorry I'm late. Long story.

12:35.841 --> 12:36.929
Now, everybody
hit the deck!

12:37.059 --> 12:37.931
[ gasping]

12:38.061 --> 12:39.105
I'm cutting the entire line

12:39.235 --> 12:40.542
and stealing the exhibit.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.804
You're not
stealing anything.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.197
Nobody hit
the deck!

12:44.327 --> 12:46.330
Ah, the superheroes...

12:46.461 --> 12:48.724
Or should I say, "super zeroes?"

12:48.855 --> 12:50.116
That was uncalled for.

12:50.246 --> 12:51.770
Animals, attack.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.033
[ blowing whistle]

You're going down,
my friend--

13:23.715 --> 13:24.586
Down Under!

[ laughs]

13:26.370 --> 13:27.807
[ Bender screaming]

13:27.937 --> 13:31.898
A man boxing a kangaroo
is a peculiar spectacle

13:32.028 --> 13:33.899
but a kangaroo boxing a robot?

13:34.029 --> 13:35.902
Now I'm afraid you've lost me.

Nice job, Fingers.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.134
[ kissing]

13:51.264 --> 13:52.831
I'm scared
and confused.

13:52.961 --> 13:56.530
I think we've
wandered into an
off-Broadway play.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.184
No, there are way
too many people here.

13:58.315 --> 14:00.751
[ panting]

14:00.883 --> 14:04.974
Later, if anyone asks when
I got away, tell them right now.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.062
[ both grunting]

14:07.193 --> 14:08.282
Forget it, Zookeeper.

14:08.412 --> 14:09.979
You're going into captivity.

14:10.110 --> 14:11.327
Fool!

14:11.458 --> 14:13.982
A quip about putting
me behind bars

14:14.114 --> 14:15.724
would have been
far more delicious.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.943
Here, catch.

14:18.073 --> 14:20.947
No, Fry, you can't
fall fast enough!

I don't got it!

[ applause and cheering]

14:30.782 --> 14:32.219
You saved
the Gemerald!

14:32.349 --> 14:34.350
Yet the Zookeeper escaped...

14:34.481 --> 14:38.965
thus proving that the deadliest
animal of all is the Zookeeper.

14:39.095 --> 14:40.749
You can get off
me anytime.

14:40.879 --> 14:41.923
Oh, no.

14:42.054 --> 14:43.577
My parents are leaving.

back into street Leela.

There they are.[ cameras clicking]

14:48.017 --> 14:49.105
Thank you,
mysterious heroes.

14:49.235 --> 14:50.453
The value of the Gemerald

14:50.585 --> 14:51.890
you saved is slightly greater

14:52.020 --> 14:54.894
than the cost of the damage
you caused to this museum.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.113
A net gain for our great city.

15:03.772 --> 15:06.078
It's good that Leela
doesn't love us.

15:06.208 --> 15:07.907
She'll be less
sad when we die.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.995

15:18.004 --> 15:19.961
Mom, Dad?

15:20.092 --> 15:21.268
I showed up

15:21.398 --> 15:23.139
and I got the audio tour

15:23.269 --> 15:25.576
for "Treasures
of Liberace's Tomb."

15:34.672 --> 15:37.066
[ groaning]

15:42.375 --> 15:43.506
Sweetie,
it's okay.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.726
You don't have
to apologize for
standing us up

15:45.856 --> 15:48.424
on the only visit
to the surface
we'll ever have.

15:48.556 --> 15:51.688
I want to tell you why
I didn't show up, but I can't.

15:51.820 --> 15:55.258
Just please believe me
that it was a very good reason.

15:55.389 --> 15:58.043
I'm sorry
I disappointed you.

15:59.219 --> 16:02.004
Leela, you could never
disappoint us.

16:02.134 --> 16:05.268
We're so proud
of everything
that you are.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.009
And we always
will be.

16:07.139 --> 16:09.620
Because you're
our baby girl.

16:11.447 --> 16:13.058
Oh...

16:13.188 --> 16:14.321
I can't take it.

You're a superhero?

16:24.895 --> 16:27.159
[ laughing]:
Well, that's wonderful.

16:27.289 --> 16:30.250
But did you have to make
the costume so revealing?

16:30.379 --> 16:33.296
Look at me--
proud dad of a superhero.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.690
We should
print up T-shirts.

16:35.820 --> 16:39.302
And F-shirts for our
friends with two arms
on the same side.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.652
No, listen. It's very important

16:41.783 --> 16:44.133
that you never, evertell
anyone.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.743
Under any circumstance.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.005
What if I've had a few?

16:47.135 --> 16:48.919
Dad? You drink?

16:49.051 --> 16:50.966
No, not even then.

16:51.096 --> 16:54.143
All right. My sucker is sealed.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.927
In fact, I shouldn't even
be wearing this around here.

It was brisk.

That's my girl.

So, uh... anyway,
my daughter's Clobberella.

17:11.377 --> 17:13.249
Leela is Clobberella?!

17:13.380 --> 17:14.555
You're pulling me.

17:14.684 --> 17:16.164
Shh! Keep it under your sock.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.252
It's a big secret.

17:17.384 --> 17:18.906
That's why I'm only telling
you two.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.125
Oh, my God.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.518
That guy's daughter is
Clobberella.

17:21.648 --> 17:23.172

Uh, Professor,
isn't it time for your nap?

Yes, damn it!

Zookeeper, how did you know
our real identities?

Let's just say
a little bird told me.

that parrot is mimicking

18:01.123 --> 18:02.124
telling the truth by proxy?

18:02.255 --> 18:03.430
Yes.

18:03.559 --> 18:06.824
My parents were so hurt,
I couldn't help it.

18:06.954 --> 18:09.653
But I distinctly told them
not to tell anyone.

18:09.784 --> 18:13.788
We are not amused.

18:13.917 --> 18:17.530
And here's something you may
or may not find interesting.

please forgive us.

Especially your father,
who's the one who told

18:27.366 --> 18:29.107
thank you very much,
Morris.

18:29.238 --> 18:31.109
Are you all right?
Has he hurt you?

No, but my allergies
are going nuts.

on everything.

All right, Zookeeper,
what do you want?

18:43.991 --> 18:46.211
Why, the Quantum Gemerald,
of course.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.387
You must steal it for me
by midnight

18:48.518 --> 18:52.305
or your parents will be devoured
by piranhas that I have--

18:52.434 --> 18:55.307
shall we say-- persuaded
to walk on dry land.

18:55.438 --> 18:56.439
[ laughing wickedly]

18:56.569 --> 18:57.875
Save us, Leela!

I mean, if-if you don't have
anything better to do.

19:04.446 --> 19:05.448
We're out of options.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.189
We have to steal
the Gemerald.

19:07.319 --> 19:11.324
But... should superheroes commit
a crime, even to save lives?

19:11.453 --> 19:12.586
I need moral guidance.

Hmm...

The thought
of stealing anything
