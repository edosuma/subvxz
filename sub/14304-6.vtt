Nooooo.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.305
But I was a baby once.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.307
Yes, yes, I bring weapons.
What am I? Tadpole?

02:22.309 --> 02:23.842
It's not that easy, Star.

02:23.844 --> 02:27.312
Will bring
torture bag as well.
See you soon.

will we take you on?

03:05.686 --> 03:07.486
A nap.
What!?

03:07.488 --> 03:10.856
We follow the instructions
Buffrog left us and they nap.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.659
Then this will be a nap
they will never forget!

03:13.661 --> 03:16.295
Just read me
what the book says.
Fine.

sleep on their sides.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.339
Nadia and Sergei
on their left.

Katrina is delicate
and must be held to sleep.

03:34.914 --> 03:35.981
Okay, what now?

03:35.983 --> 03:38.350

They just sleep.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.361
Oh, come on.
Where's the fun in that?

03:49.363 --> 03:51.730
It's not just about
having fun, Star.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.066
But babies  <i>need </i> fun.

03:54.068 --> 03:58.036

No. Babies have
routine and schedule.
Ugh.

feed babies lunch.

Oh, wait. Don't do that.

Whoa there, Diaz.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.646

05:47.648 --> 05:50.015

09:17.024 --> 09:19.991
All right.
No-o-ow!! Pose!

09:19.993 --> 09:21.893
Great. Great.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.161
Now, back it up.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.563
Back it up and spin!

09:26.098 --> 09:28.867
Then look for your sister
under the nearest object!

09:28.869 --> 09:30.569
( clock bell gongs )

09:30.571 --> 09:32.070
<i>♪ Space unicorn!</i>
<i>Soaring through the stars ♪</i>

09:32.072 --> 09:33.705
They're doing it!

09:33.707 --> 09:35.106
<i>♪ Delivering the rainbows</i>

09:35.108 --> 09:37.008
I think they found something!

09:37.010 --> 09:38.209
<i>♪ All around the world!</i>

09:38.211 --> 09:39.778
Katrina.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.747
Star!

09:42.749 --> 09:44.115
Why do you have
so many bear traps?

09:44.117 --> 09:46.551
You're afraid to tell Jackie
you have a crush on her,

09:46.553 --> 09:48.386
but you're not afraid of bears?

09:48.388 --> 09:49.588
I don't get you, Marco.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.089
How are we gonna get to her?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.791
We use the binder.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.093
What?!
( Star grunts )

09:55.095 --> 09:56.695
( slow-motion scream)
Nooooo!

09:56.697 --> 09:58.597
( traps snap and clang loudly )

10:01.634 --> 10:03.068
Babies!

10:03.070 --> 10:04.869
( Babies croak )

10:04.871 --> 10:05.870
( gasps )

10:05.872 --> 10:07.939
( Babies croak loudly )

10:09.108 --> 10:11.977
( gasps )
Awww. ( sobs )

10:11.979 --> 10:14.212
Hey, are you okay?

10:14.214 --> 10:16.715
( sobbing )
I miss baby tadpole grow legs!

10:16.717 --> 10:20.385
Most important
developmental stage
of child development.

10:20.387 --> 10:23.321
Well, little Katrina
hasn't grown her legs yet.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.157
( gasps happily )
My little late bloomer.

10:29.929 --> 10:31.563
Come to Papa!

10:31.565 --> 10:33.264
( Buffrog giggles )
( Katrina croaks loudly )

10:33.266 --> 10:35.900
Booooop!

10:35.902 --> 10:37.669
Bye little Katrina-kins.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.270
Don't forget the binder.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.339
Look, we added a chapter.
( bear traps clang )

10:41.341 --> 10:43.274
Aww...

10:43.276 --> 10:45.844
Thank you, Star girl.
And Karate Boy.

10:45.846 --> 10:49.648
I will remember this,
like something I will
never forget.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.516
( portal zaps close )

10:51.518 --> 10:54.152
I like that guy.
Yeah. Me too.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.254
TINY MARCO:
Wohooo!

10:56.256 --> 10:59.190
You know,
sometimes you do
have to forget the rules

10:59.192 --> 11:01.126
and focus on
just having fun.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.294
You can't forget them
completely though.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.497
They make the fun
that much sweeter.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.298
You think
they'll  ever get that?

11:07.300 --> 11:09.200
( Marco and Star snore softly )

11:09.202 --> 11:11.870
TINY STAR:
Give them time.
They're still young.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.611
( crickets chirp in distance )

11:22.982 --> 11:25.183
( jovial music starts )

11:46.172 --> 11:49.007
( music comes to
a jarring end slowly )

11:49.009 --> 11:50.575
( Babies croaking softly )

11:54.714 --> 11:56.414
( croaking continues )

11:58.350 --> 11:59.818
Call BooFly.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.386
( beeping )

12:01.388 --> 12:02.754
( nasally voice )
<i>Hey, Buffrog!</i>

12:02.756 --> 12:04.389
<i>Long time no see, man!</i>

12:04.391 --> 12:06.057
<i>I heard you have kids now.</i>

12:06.059 --> 12:08.526
Yes, 12 beautiful babies.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.028
Very hungry.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.529
I hear you're hiring
for a job.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.264
<i>Are you sure you're up for it?</i>

12:13.266 --> 12:14.833
<i>You've been</i>
<i>out of the game for a while.</i>

12:14.835 --> 12:17.335
Oh,
don't worry about me.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.270
I am just as evil as ever.

12:19.272 --> 12:22.574
Hmm. Hehehe.
( evil laughter )

12:24.443 --> 12:26.144
( toy squeaks )

12:29.448 --> 12:32.417
It'll be just fine.
Star and I got this handled.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.619
Just like a suitcase.
Totally handled.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.789
Okay. Daddy will come
get you after work.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.858
Six o'clock sharp.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.127
Be good and
listen to babysitters.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.361
( portal zaps close )

12:45.931 --> 12:48.433
( bawls loudly )
( sniffs )

12:48.435 --> 12:51.202
Come on.
Pull yourself together, man.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.704
Who's more evil than you?

12:52.706 --> 12:54.405
( gruffly )
Nobody!

12:54.407 --> 12:56.274
( grunts and shouts )
Hiya!

12:56.276 --> 12:58.443
Hya! Hya! Hya!

12:58.445 --> 13:00.378
( shouting fades )

13:03.415 --> 13:05.283
( grunting )

13:05.285 --> 13:06.584
Buffrog?

13:06.586 --> 13:07.719
Bufforg.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.287
Buffrog, Buffrog?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.722
Buffrog, Buffrog.

13:10.724 --> 13:11.890
<i>The </i> Buffrog?

13:11.892 --> 13:13.124
Actually...

13:13.126 --> 13:15.927
it's Yovginei Buffgoiapov.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.562
What?

13:17.564 --> 13:21.399
Guys, welcome
the newest member
of our team.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.068
This guy?
Look a little... soft.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.503
To me.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.005
Soft?!

13:27.973 --> 13:30.475
( grunts and snarls )

13:30.477 --> 13:31.376
Oooh.

13:32.444 --> 13:34.345
He's just like me.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.380
Ah, whatever.

13:36.582 --> 13:38.783
Last time he got
his hands dirty

13:38.785 --> 13:41.986
he was changing diapers.
Heh-heh.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.588
You want me
to change  <i>your </i> diaper?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.356
( gasps )
( growls angrily )

13:45.358 --> 13:46.791
Guys! Guys, guys, guys.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.092
We're all on
the same team here.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.360
We have work to do.

13:50.930 --> 13:53.164
( country music plays )

13:57.102 --> 13:58.336
( tap tap )

14:03.609 --> 14:05.210
Cooorrn!

14:05.212 --> 14:06.644
Coorrrrrrnn!

14:06.646 --> 14:09.547
Wait. Only Mewmans
have corn.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.217
How rats have corn
when monsters are starving?

14:12.219 --> 14:13.618
That's what we're here
to find out.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.955
In that case,
let's get show on road.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.356
BOTH:
Thumpie-bumpies!

14:18.358 --> 14:19.858
Okay, here is plan.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.392
A) We capture rat.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.361
B) Make him tell us
where he got corn.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.863
Well, great.
I'll just go grab him!

14:24.865 --> 14:27.632
No, no.
Give your abs a break.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.567
We must do this quietly.

14:29.569 --> 14:33.404
Let me teach you about
the element of surprise.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.173
( grunts and shouts )

14:35.175 --> 14:39.577
BOOFLY:
Aw, yeah! Buffrog's back!

14:39.579 --> 14:42.213
( rat squeaks )
( softly )
Surprise!

14:42.215 --> 14:44.382
( cackles triumphantly )

14:44.384 --> 14:46.017
Okay, little guy.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.419
You and me
will have little talk.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.358
( shouts in surprise )
Wait!

14:53.360 --> 14:54.525
DOGBULL:
What was that?

14:54.527 --> 14:56.861
Baby oil on your fingers?
( laughs )

14:56.863 --> 14:58.196
BOOFLY:
Umm, Buffrog?

14:58.198 --> 14:59.731
Did that just happen?

14:59.733 --> 15:01.032
Uhhh...

15:01.034 --> 15:02.500
Look what was in
the Lost and Found.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.602
He-he.
Yeah, 'cause he lost it.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.204
And we found it! Right?

15:06.206 --> 15:08.606
( laughs )

15:08.608 --> 15:10.708
Uuuhh...
Hey Buff Frog!

15:10.710 --> 15:14.846
Why don't you show
the team your patented
interrogation technique.

15:14.848 --> 15:17.181
This guy's the best!
( chuckles nervously )

15:23.422 --> 15:26.524
We will do this the easy way
<i>and </i> the hard way.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.626
Easy for me,

15:28.628 --> 15:31.095
and hard for you.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.298
This is amazing!

15:33.300 --> 15:34.966
He-heh.
Told you he was good.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.369
Where did you get the corn?

15:44.443 --> 15:45.877
Uuhhh!
( groans )

15:45.879 --> 15:48.446
This rat is tougher
than I thought.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.581
You're not going
to want to see this.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.583
Uuh, yeah I do!
No, no, no.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.585
Lets, uh, leave the master
to his work.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.955
You know how artists are.
( chuckles )

15:58.824 --> 16:00.625
( whimpers )
( thud )

16:00.627 --> 16:02.894
Ooh! What is happening to me?

16:04.163 --> 16:06.097
( squeaks )
I can't do this to you.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.732
Wait. What am I doing?

16:09.301 --> 16:11.636
I know what you're thinking.

16:11.638 --> 16:15.740
You think I'm soft because
I have children, don't you?

16:15.742 --> 16:17.775
( growls )
I'll show you!

16:17.777 --> 16:19.777
( Rat squeals loudly )

16:19.779 --> 16:22.580
( Rat screeching )

16:22.582 --> 16:24.615
Oh, and can you believe
Nadia here?

16:24.617 --> 16:27.485
Seriously. There ought
to be a law against
something that cute.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.521
Oooh! We should do
live chat with them.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.689
I call Star right now.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.291
( beeping )
( Rat screeching )

16:33.293 --> 16:34.492
It's ringing!

16:34.494 --> 16:35.593
BOOFLY:
I'm telling you,

16:35.595 --> 16:37.829
He probably found
all the corn by now.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.132
What did you just do?!

16:41.134 --> 16:44.602
You let him go?!
Umm, yes.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.305
But it's uhh--
It's all according
to the plan.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.974
I've seen him do this
a hundred times.
It's a classic.

16:49.976 --> 16:52.510
Buffrog interrogates
the prisoner,
then lets him go,

16:52.512 --> 16:54.946
'cause he's so freaked out that
he'll lead us right to where
the corn came from...

16:54.948 --> 16:56.347
technique.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.983
Am I right, B?
Oh, yes.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.551
Yes, never fails.

17:02.554 --> 17:04.389
( sniffs )

17:04.391 --> 17:06.958
Well, I guess I can track
his scent from here.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.926
( continues sniffing )

17:10.662 --> 17:13.064
Hey, Bruh, are you good?
'Cause, um...

17:13.066 --> 17:15.366
that didn't look good.
I know. I know!

17:15.368 --> 17:18.569
This should be easy...
but nothing is feeling right.

17:18.571 --> 17:21.039
You blow this again,
I'm not gonna be able
to cover for you!

17:21.041 --> 17:22.774
No, no.
I got this.

17:25.477 --> 17:28.846
( footsteps
in marching cadence )

17:28.848 --> 17:30.281
Jackpot.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.487
Yes, but this
is not the source.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.022
Is only supply route.

17:38.024 --> 17:40.224
Hey, Buff-Daddy.
You with us, or what?

17:40.226 --> 17:42.560
Yes. One hundred percent.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.162
Okay, guys...

17:44.164 --> 17:45.763
( softly )
quiet...

17:46.832 --> 17:49.667
( soft metallic whooshing )

17:51.670 --> 17:53.004
( loud baby music plays )

17:53.006 --> 17:54.405
( Buffrog gaps and fumbles )

17:54.407 --> 17:55.773
( rats squeak )

17:55.775 --> 17:57.942
Uuh... Umm...

17:57.944 --> 17:59.043
Shh!

17:59.045 --> 18:00.244
( grunting )

18:00.246 --> 18:01.779
( hoarsely )
Stop it!

18:01.781 --> 18:04.549
( music slows down )
( Buffrog grunts )

18:04.551 --> 18:07.919
( Rats squeak and squeal )

18:07.921 --> 18:10.688
( baby music
fades into distance )

18:10.690 --> 18:12.723
That was...
Katrina's favorite--

18:12.725 --> 18:14.859
( growls menacingly )
Guys, guys, guys!

18:14.861 --> 18:16.761
Keep your cool.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.796
Now, we're gonna
do this my way.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.798
We follow the supply route
back to the source...

18:20.800 --> 18:24.702
and we'll be swimming
in delicious corrrnn!!!

18:24.704 --> 18:26.737
BOTH:
Cooorrrrrnn!

18:26.739 --> 18:28.239
Cooorrrrrnn!

18:28.241 --> 18:29.807
Cooorrr--
No, no.

18:29.809 --> 18:30.908
Not you.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.443
( whimpers softly )

18:32.445 --> 18:34.846
All right!
Everyone else, move out!

18:36.548 --> 18:37.915
Oh, wait! Boo Fly! Please.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.317
I need one more chance.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.652
Just go home, man.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.988
Thumbie-bumpie?

18:43.990 --> 18:46.557
No, man.
No thumpie-bumpie.

18:50.929 --> 18:52.730
( phone rings )

18:54.733 --> 18:56.067
( explosion )

18:59.471 --> 19:01.105
( gasps )
( sobs )

19:04.409 --> 19:05.710
( gasps )

19:09.515 --> 19:10.648
ALL: Corn!

19:11.783 --> 19:13.751
( shouting in joy )

19:15.621 --> 19:17.788
( grunt and groan )
( force field hums )

19:17.790 --> 19:21.526
Noo!
Stupid Mewmans!

19:21.528 --> 19:23.861
( thump )
( force field hums )

19:23.863 --> 19:25.196
( thump )
( force field hums )

19:25.198 --> 19:27.231
( buzzing )
DOGBULL:
Huh? Green hole?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.168
( growls and grumbles )

19:30.170 --> 19:31.936
( grunts and growls )

19:31.938 --> 19:34.705
You can't fit in there.
You need to try
something small--

19:34.707 --> 19:36.374
Hey!
( grunts and struggles )

19:36.376 --> 19:39.777
Corn, corn, corn.
Ha ha! Corn! Corn! Corn!

19:39.779 --> 19:41.012
( grunting in distance )
Huh?

19:42.514 --> 19:44.282
My corn!

19:44.284 --> 19:46.117
Come on, man,
suck in your gut!

19:46.119 --> 19:47.518
You there, monsters!

19:47.520 --> 19:48.686
Get away...

19:48.688 --> 19:51.455
from my corrnn!!

20:00.199 --> 20:02.133
( fire roars )

20:04.536 --> 20:05.870
Woopsie!

20:05.872 --> 20:07.872
( Monsters gasp )

20:07.874 --> 20:09.307
Noo! Later!

20:09.309 --> 20:10.808
We're toast!

20:10.810 --> 20:11.876
( fire roars loudly )

20:11.878 --> 20:13.110
( groans )

20:20.152 --> 20:22.220
( Buffrog roars )

20:24.323 --> 20:25.990
I thought you went home!

20:25.992 --> 20:27.825
We are  <i>all </i> going home.

20:36.368 --> 20:37.935
( groans )

20:37.937 --> 20:39.370
My ab! My Ab!!

20:39.372 --> 20:41.339
I'm missing an ab!
( ab creaks )

20:41.341 --> 20:43.541
Oh, thank corn.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.109
Thanks, Buffrog!

20:45.111 --> 20:47.745
Thank you for saving us.
Sorry we were mean!

20:47.747 --> 20:49.780
Just doing my job.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.616
I'm never making
fun of dads again!

20:52.784 --> 20:55.119
Aww, c'mere,
my little perogis!

20:55.121 --> 20:57.355
( Monsters chuckles shyly )

20:57.357 --> 20:59.857
I don't want to ruin
a moment but, um...

20:59.859 --> 21:01.392
we didn't get any corn.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.794
True. We did not get corn.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.597
But mission
not a failure.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.966
We found hole
in Mewman force field

21:08.968 --> 21:10.868
that they did not know
was there.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.204
We just need a way
to get in through that hole.

21:13.206 --> 21:14.772
If anyone can do it...

21:14.774 --> 21:15.873
you can!

21:15.875 --> 21:18.242
Now, I must get babies.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.777
( gasps happily )

21:19.779 --> 21:21.979
Daddy missed you so much,
my little kreplachs!

21:21.981 --> 21:23.247
( portal zaps close )

21:23.249 --> 21:25.383
Know what?
I'm gonna call my dad.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.386
