WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:01.609
Previously, on "Brockmire."

00:01.651 --> 00:04.046
Ten years ago, your
breakdown in the booth

00:04.260 --> 00:07.586
and press conference were
like the original viral videos.

00:07.659 --> 00:08.838
Who am I broadcasting to?

00:08.870 --> 00:10.354
You'll be doing exclusive play-by-play

00:10.385 --> 00:11.208
to the stadium.

00:11.221 --> 00:12.612
I'm the P.A. announcer?

00:12.651 --> 00:13.916
Here comes the pitch...

00:13.940 --> 00:15.479
Well, that was nothin'
if not predictable.

00:15.534 --> 00:17.886
You're starting to look good to
me, and you're a goddamn disaster.

00:17.901 --> 00:20.254
A surprise finger in the keister!

00:20.300 --> 00:22.296
And Brockmire is into it.

00:22.347 --> 00:24.134
You think I'm ever gonna
be remembered for anything

00:24.300 --> 00:27.446
except for the worst moments of my life?

00:27.797 --> 00:29.838
You're "Brutal Brockmire"
till the day you die.

00:30.789 --> 00:34.091
"Fun fact, Butterman is"...
That's not a fun fact.

00:34.127 --> 00:35.421
Jenny, we got to watch these cards.

00:35.514 --> 00:36.547
Sip.

00:39.232 --> 00:40.464
Yeah?

00:40.500 --> 00:42.300
We need to talk.

00:43.369 --> 00:45.269
Um, all right.

00:45.305 --> 00:47.171
Let's, uh, take a quick break.

00:47.206 --> 00:48.673
Give us the room, please, ladies.

00:53.546 --> 00:55.046
No, I don't want one.

00:55.081 --> 00:57.582
Uh, if we're about to have the
conversation I think we are,

00:57.617 --> 00:58.516
you're gonna want one.

00:58.551 --> 01:00.024
So, you've seen the pictures?

01:00.094 --> 01:00.969
I have not.

01:01.063 --> 01:03.246
Look, they're blowing
it out of proportion.

01:03.289 --> 01:05.414
It was just a Halloween costume.

01:05.476 --> 01:08.179
Six years broadcasting
with you in this booth

01:08.313 --> 01:09.479
and they want to kick me to the curb

01:09.514 --> 01:11.062
over some goofy pictures?

01:11.716 --> 01:12.882
"Goofy pictures"?

01:12.917 --> 01:14.584
You're in goddamn lingerie

01:14.619 --> 01:16.152
kissing a woman dressed as a man.

01:16.187 --> 01:17.887
Robbie, that's Kansas City out there,

01:17.922 --> 01:20.056
not "Caba-goddamn-ret."

01:20.091 --> 01:21.424
So, you have seen them?

01:21.459 --> 01:23.126
Well, of course I've seen
them. Everybody's seen them.

01:23.161 --> 01:25.595
And why'd you have to be so
goddamn attractive in them,

01:25.630 --> 01:27.597
especially after 9/11?

01:27.632 --> 01:29.399
What's 9/11 have to do with anything?

01:29.434 --> 01:32.435
9/11 has to do with everything.
People are still fragile.

01:32.470 --> 01:34.270
They can't handle the confusing feelings

01:34.306 --> 01:36.906
brought on by the combination
of your delicate features

01:36.941 --> 01:38.207
and muscular build.

01:38.243 --> 01:40.043
I know I couldn't.

01:40.078 --> 01:42.245
Look, I'm swallowing my pride,

01:42.280 --> 01:44.113
and I'm asking you for help.

01:44.149 --> 01:46.516
Because... frankly,

01:46.551 --> 01:48.985
you have an insane amount of power.

01:49.020 --> 01:52.455
And with one word, you can save me.

01:52.490 --> 01:53.690
Come on, Jim.

01:53.725 --> 01:55.625
A broadcast team is still a team.

01:57.028 --> 01:58.394
Look, Robbie, you're
too late, all right?

01:58.430 --> 02:00.730
It's already been done.

02:01.933 --> 02:05.301
Who's my replacement?

02:05.337 --> 02:08.037
Well you're looking at him.

02:08.073 --> 02:10.139
Robbie, they offered me a one-man booth.

02:10.175 --> 02:11.555
I mean, can you believe it?

02:11.579 --> 02:13.509
I mean, Red Barber, Vince Scully,

02:13.545 --> 02:14.877
and now Jim Brockmire.

02:14.913 --> 02:17.180
I just... I can't get over it.

02:17.215 --> 02:20.149
Look, friend, this'll
all blow over soon.

02:20.185 --> 02:21.451
You'll be fine.

02:21.486 --> 02:22.752
Few years from now, they're
gonna invite you back

02:22.787 --> 02:23.886
for Old Timers Day.

02:23.922 --> 02:26.322
It'll be like none
of this ever happened.

02:26.358 --> 02:28.658
Look, I-I just... I want to
thank you for everything...

02:28.693 --> 02:31.012
Vince Scully is a legend.

02:31.763 --> 02:34.945
You're a deep voice in a cheap suit.

02:35.734 --> 02:37.834
People will learn that eventually.

02:37.869 --> 02:41.371
The real you is too
ugly to hide forever.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:50.815 --> 02:52.037
Now, just relax.

02:52.091 --> 02:54.851
The break between a double header
is the best time in baseball.

02:54.886 --> 02:57.120
It's that perfect blend of postgame high

02:57.155 --> 02:58.321
and pregame jitters.

02:58.356 --> 03:00.590
It's known as the
broadcaster's speed ball.

03:00.625 --> 03:03.693
Okay, the only thing dumber

03:03.728 --> 03:05.928
than playing two
boring-ass baseball games

03:05.964 --> 03:07.864
in one day is putting a two-hour delay

03:07.899 --> 03:09.365
in between the boring-ass games.

03:09.401 --> 03:11.801
You just have to use the time

03:11.836 --> 03:14.237
to contemplate the more
important things in life,

03:14.272 --> 03:16.205
like rye whisky, for example.

03:16.241 --> 03:18.341
This is the first American...
Hey, pay attention.

03:18.376 --> 03:20.610
... first American booze
made by the colonists

03:20.645 --> 03:23.413
when rum started to become scarce.

03:23.448 --> 03:25.715
Rye whisky has a quiet dignity about it.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.583
Please, stop. Stop it.

03:27.619 --> 03:30.520
I watch you get drunk all day every day.

03:30.555 --> 03:34.056
Yeah, I just can't bear
to hear you describe it.

03:34.092 --> 03:38.261
Can we maybe try to have a conversation?

03:38.296 --> 03:39.896
Okay.

03:39.931 --> 03:42.465
Um, well, do you have
any questions for me?

03:42.500 --> 03:44.767
No. I already know everything about you.

03:44.803 --> 03:47.437
You've literally never asked
me a question about myself.

03:47.472 --> 03:49.005
Oh, come on. That's not true.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.407
Just yesterday I asked you...

03:51.443 --> 03:53.743
I asked you if my breath
still smelled like vomit.

03:53.778 --> 03:55.478
All right, no, point taken. Point taken.

03:57.242 --> 04:00.876
_

04:02.671 --> 04:06.120
_

04:08.128 --> 04:09.839
_

04:09.910 --> 04:10.910
_

04:11.095 --> 04:12.295
Hey.

04:12.330 --> 04:13.663
Make sure and translate
what I'm about to say.

04:13.698 --> 04:15.331
- It's important.
- For the last time,

04:15.366 --> 04:16.999
I am not his translator.

04:17.035 --> 04:19.902
I am a reporter... hm...
Assigned to cover him.

04:19.938 --> 04:22.004
Whatever, man. Just
help me out here, okay?

04:22.040 --> 04:24.807
- Fine, fine, fine.
- Hey, yo, listen up!

04:26.711 --> 04:28.411
Hey, since we got to kill sometime today

04:28.446 --> 04:30.379
before the second game
of the double header,

04:30.415 --> 04:32.315
I thought we should do
our first kangaroo court

04:32.350 --> 04:33.516
of the year, baby.

04:35.353 --> 04:38.020
This is for the new guys.
This is how the Frackers do it.

04:38.056 --> 04:39.755
You accuse someone of an offense.

04:39.791 --> 04:42.258
They argue their case, and then we vote.

04:42.293 --> 04:44.293
Hey. You getting all this?

04:44.329 --> 04:46.062
Uh, yes, yes. Hey, Yoshi.

04:46.413 --> 04:49.874
_

04:50.702 --> 04:52.134
- Ah?
- "Ah."

04:52.170 --> 04:53.402
Exactly.

04:53.438 --> 04:56.405
If they are guilty, they
pay the fine into the kitty.

04:56.441 --> 04:59.709
Now, remember, the kitty is for the beer

04:59.744 --> 05:03.079
and the porn website
passwords we share, so pay up!

05:03.114 --> 05:04.647
Pay up!

05:04.682 --> 05:05.915
Hey, who wants to start?

05:05.950 --> 05:07.817
- Me! Me!
- Right here! Right here!

05:07.852 --> 05:10.820
Hey, hey!

05:10.855 --> 05:13.222
Elton missed a bunt sign last week.

05:13.258 --> 05:15.625
- Ooh!
- A-At Slippery Rock?

05:15.660 --> 05:17.126
I thought Coach gave me the swing away.

05:18.129 --> 05:19.161
Hey, what says the room?

05:19.197 --> 05:20.997
Guilty!

05:21.032 --> 05:23.533
Hey! I'd like to accuse Elton again.

05:23.568 --> 05:24.967
What's the offense?

05:25.003 --> 05:27.270
Just, like, being a whiny little bitch.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.307
What are you guys even talking about?!

05:31.342 --> 05:33.576
Guilty!

05:33.611 --> 05:36.112
- Guilty!
- I have someone.

05:36.147 --> 05:38.714
I accuse el hijo de la porra, "Ooshi."

05:47.147 --> 05:48.147
"Unchi da."

05:49.093 --> 05:50.192
"It's Yoshi."

05:50.228 --> 05:51.160
"Unchi."

05:54.288 --> 05:57.289
- Ooh.
- Oh.

05:57.669 --> 05:58.901
Oh!

05:58.937 --> 06:01.404
- I know what I always meant to ask you.
- Okay.

06:01.439 --> 06:03.472
Why do you work for a baseball team

06:03.508 --> 06:07.276
when you are so defiantly
ignorant about the game?

06:07.312 --> 06:09.879
This team is the only thing
that makes our town special.

06:09.914 --> 06:12.415
I plan on getting some experience here,

06:12.450 --> 06:16.752
then moving to New York
to finally start my life.

06:16.788 --> 06:18.621
Sounds like a decent plan for you.

06:18.656 --> 06:20.056
You'd probably do pretty well in Chelsea

06:20.091 --> 06:22.058
if you just bulk up a little bit.

06:22.093 --> 06:23.859
You know, 'cause right now
you got the delicate frame

06:23.895 --> 06:26.662
of a twink, but you don't
quite have the temperament.

06:28.366 --> 06:29.982
Um...

06:31.002 --> 06:32.402
What?

06:33.171 --> 06:35.304
I say you have the
delicate frame of a twink...

06:35.340 --> 06:37.506
No, I-I heard you.

06:37.542 --> 06:40.176
I just...

06:40.211 --> 06:43.813
I'm not gay, Brockmire.

06:43.848 --> 06:46.788
And why would you think that I am?

06:47.285 --> 06:48.818
'Cause I never seen you with a girl,

06:48.853 --> 06:50.486
you're uncomfortable in your own skin,

06:50.521 --> 06:52.855
and you tend to hug the
walls when you're in public.

06:52.890 --> 06:55.858
See, what you just described
is a socially awkward nerd.

06:55.893 --> 06:58.361
That's who I am.

06:58.396 --> 07:01.497
I panic around girls and crowds

07:01.532 --> 07:03.833
and people I don't know.

07:03.868 --> 07:05.501
All right, but I also used your computer

07:05.536 --> 07:07.536
to look up some naked
photos of Ann-Margret...

07:07.572 --> 07:09.205
- Okay, wow!
- ... and I discovered

07:09.240 --> 07:11.974
what you called your
"inspiration" folder,

07:12.010 --> 07:13.776
which is really just a bunch of pictures

07:13.811 --> 07:16.946
of handsome men in
various states of dress.

07:16.981 --> 07:23.319
What you found was my
fashion inspiration folder.

07:23.354 --> 07:24.754
Okay, did you wonder

07:24.789 --> 07:28.991
why 90% of those photos
were just of shoes?

07:29.027 --> 07:31.694
I just figured that was some
kind of a gay black thing.

07:33.064 --> 07:35.031
I need your language skills.

07:35.066 --> 07:36.465
Locker room is about to explode.

07:36.501 --> 07:38.634
I mean, they were speaking
Japanese and Spanish so fast

07:38.670 --> 07:40.036
I could barely understand
what they were saying.

07:40.071 --> 07:41.937
I've seen my fair share
of kangaroo courts,

07:41.973 --> 07:43.272
but I've never seen anything like this.

07:43.307 --> 07:44.540
It's all gonna be fine.

07:44.575 --> 07:46.609
It's just the locker room's
way of cleansing itself.

07:46.644 --> 07:48.511
It all gets worked out...

07:52.083 --> 07:53.015
Yep.

08:01.269 --> 08:03.769
Whoa! Whoa!

08:03.816 --> 08:06.204
Please, just tranquillo, all right?

08:06.275 --> 08:08.909
And you guys, uh...

08:08.945 --> 08:11.278
Nobody do anything.

08:11.314 --> 08:13.147
All right, so, here's the deal.

08:13.182 --> 08:16.550
Um, the Latin players
all have Uribe's back,

08:16.586 --> 08:18.552
but the pitchers all support Yoshi.

08:18.588 --> 08:20.187
All right, but this is
okay. This is just...

08:20.223 --> 08:21.989
This is the way the locker
room cleanses itself.

08:22.024 --> 08:22.990
Oh, no, no, no.

08:23.025 --> 08:24.358
No matter how this thing shakes out,

08:24.393 --> 08:26.894
one half of this locker room is
not gonna play with the other,

08:26.929 --> 08:29.530
so, no, this is a doozy of
a pickle of a shit storm.

08:29.565 --> 08:31.365
Anyhoos, best of luck to you.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.765
Wait a minute.

08:32.802 --> 08:35.001
For some reason, our attendance
is back in the crapper.

08:35.037 --> 08:37.238
We can't alienate the
rest of the fans we have

08:37.273 --> 08:38.205
by canceling the second game.

08:38.241 --> 08:39.306
You have to fix this.

08:39.342 --> 08:41.008
I do? Me? Why me?

08:41.043 --> 08:42.842
I-I'm the P.A. announcer.

08:42.879 --> 08:45.980
'Cause nobody else in town speaks both
Spanish and Japanese, and you know,

08:46.015 --> 08:47.982
Yoshi's translator's
gotten really uppity lately.

08:48.017 --> 08:50.484
You know, I know I could
help, but why would I?

08:50.520 --> 08:52.887
Hey, that... No, that's
your team, not mine.

08:52.922 --> 08:54.922
You have something better to do?

08:54.957 --> 08:55.632
I do, actually.

08:55.664 --> 08:57.355
- I was "pontifidrinking"... Right now?
- You have somewhere to be?

08:57.360 --> 08:59.693
- Okay, how about you help me...
- which is a portmanteau of "pontificating"

08:59.729 --> 09:01.729
... because last night
when you knocked on my door

09:01.764 --> 09:03.564
at 3:00 in the morning high on speed

09:03.599 --> 09:04.798
begging me to be your girlfriend...

09:04.834 --> 09:06.500
Whoa, whoa, hey.

09:06.536 --> 09:09.303
Just because I don't want
to wear a condom anymore

09:09.338 --> 09:11.272
does not make me your boyfriend.

09:11.307 --> 09:13.641
There was an implicit agreement
that you would give back

09:13.676 --> 09:15.576
- as much as I'm giving.
- What are you talking about?

09:15.611 --> 09:17.444
I've been going down
on you so much lately

09:17.480 --> 09:19.380
I put your pussy down
as my forwarding address.

09:19.415 --> 09:21.048
I'm not talking about
giving back sexually,

09:21.083 --> 09:23.217
because that should just stay
the same or increase if possible.

09:23.252 --> 09:25.519
I'm talking about a favor.

09:25.555 --> 09:28.155
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

09:29.759 --> 09:31.525
I'm gonna bring Jim in.

09:31.561 --> 09:33.527
He's gonna help us figure this out. Jim?

09:35.332 --> 09:37.064
All right, look...

09:37.099 --> 09:38.265
We all want justice here.

09:38.301 --> 09:41.368
Justice will be if the
richest guy on the team

09:41.404 --> 09:43.571
pays a $100 fine.

09:43.606 --> 09:45.339
[Players shouting indistinctly

09:49.145 --> 09:50.611
"If you're looking to blame somebody"

09:50.646 --> 09:52.246
for your injuries, perhaps
you should not stand

09:52.281 --> 09:53.714
"so close on top of the plate."

09:55.451 --> 09:56.884
"You penis biter."

09:59.288 --> 10:00.187
Whoa!

10:00.222 --> 10:01.622
Guys.

10:01.657 --> 10:02.990
Look, it's obvious that some kind

10:03.025 --> 10:06.126
of a bush-league kangaroo
court is not gonna settle this.

10:06.162 --> 10:09.296
So, instead we're gonna do a
Major League kangaroo court.

10:09.332 --> 10:11.165
That's actually not
a bad idea. All right.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.867
Major League kangaroo court...
So, that means evidence,

10:13.903 --> 10:15.669
witnesses, the whole shebang.

10:15.705 --> 10:18.639
Now, Uribe's gonna be
the prosecutor, all right?

10:18.674 --> 10:21.475
I will be the defense attorney.

10:21.510 --> 10:23.844
Now, we need a judge...
Somebody who is impartial

10:23.879 --> 10:26.347
who's not caught up in
all of this baseball drama.

10:26.382 --> 10:28.248
Yo, Drake and Taylor Swift are dating!

10:28.284 --> 10:29.817
Albums, y'all!

10:31.320 --> 10:32.453
What's going on?

10:34.149 --> 10:37.281
What is this trial even about, though?

10:37.344 --> 10:39.730
Uribe wanted Yoshi to throw a pitch

10:39.801 --> 10:42.098
and hit a batter on the other team.

10:42.332 --> 10:43.816
Oh.

10:43.918 --> 10:46.802
Well, that's easy. Uribe's guilty.

10:46.837 --> 10:48.103
- Mnh, no.
- No.

10:48.138 --> 10:50.544
That's a... That's a
standard baseball request.

10:50.591 --> 10:52.708
Yoshi's on trial 'cause he didn't do it.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.507
Baseball is a up sport,
and I want you to know it.

10:58.543 --> 10:59.842
Hey.

10:59.877 --> 11:01.844
Every...

11:01.879 --> 11:03.846
Everyone.

11:03.881 --> 11:06.482
Um, uh, Mr. Uribe,

11:06.517 --> 11:09.218
do you have any
evidence you'd like to...

11:10.688 --> 11:12.822
Oh, sí.

11:19.630 --> 11:21.964
- Oh!
- Ooh.

11:23.768 --> 11:26.035
Oh, damn.

11:26.070 --> 11:27.369
Okay.

11:27.405 --> 11:28.671
Okay.

11:28.706 --> 11:32.174
"Rawlings" is spelled out
backwards inside the bruise.

11:32.210 --> 11:33.909
Yep, that's a baseball right there.

11:33.945 --> 11:35.010
That's horrifying.

11:35.046 --> 11:37.653
Sí. Verdad.

11:37.755 --> 11:41.484
I call my witness...

11:41.519 --> 11:44.687
Ryan Stanton.

11:44.722 --> 11:46.522
Mr. Stanton,

11:46.557 --> 11:47.990
What did I tell you

11:48.025 --> 11:50.593
after ratreria's pitch hit Uribe?

11:50.628 --> 11:52.604
You told me to tell Yoshi to hurt him...

11:52.729 --> 11:54.479
Then some Dominican gibberish.

11:54.557 --> 11:56.665
- But you understood what I meant.
- Yeah.

11:56.701 --> 11:58.033
You wanted payback.

11:58.069 --> 11:59.535
Exactamente!

11:59.570 --> 12:00.922
Payback...

12:00.977 --> 12:03.439
So, did you give him my message?

12:03.474 --> 12:06.375
I made sure it was told.

12:09.431 --> 12:10.964
No more preguntas.

12:13.217 --> 12:14.150
Yoshi...

12:14.201 --> 12:15.201
_

12:15.701 --> 12:17.716
_

12:18.147 --> 12:20.045
_

12:20.537 --> 12:21.537
_

12:21.912 --> 12:22.912
_

12:24.201 --> 12:26.295
_

12:27.565 --> 12:28.831
All right.

12:28.866 --> 12:30.990
Um, Mr. Stanton...

12:31.068 --> 12:33.869
so you... you didn't
tell Yoshi yourself?

12:33.905 --> 12:36.438
I told Coach Pompom
to give him the word,

12:36.474 --> 12:38.874
then I watched Coach Pompom
go over there and tell him.

12:38.910 --> 12:40.709
You watched him, but did
you hear what he said?

12:40.745 --> 12:42.063
No.

12:42.118 --> 12:45.347
Okay, so your testimony is that
you don't really know anything.

12:45.383 --> 12:46.348
I assumed...

12:46.384 --> 12:47.850
Whoa, knowledge and assumptions,

12:47.885 --> 12:49.552
those are like Loggins and Messina.

12:49.587 --> 12:51.253
They seem similar, but time proves

12:51.289 --> 12:53.128
one of them to be completely worthless.

12:53.190 --> 12:54.351
Gentlemen, a moment.

12:54.384 --> 12:55.855
Probably just a misunderstanding.

12:55.860 --> 12:58.060
Yeah, Pompom must've called an audible

12:58.095 --> 13:00.062
and he didn't tell Yoshi
to throw at anybody.

13:00.097 --> 13:01.764
We just got to get Pompom to testify,

13:01.799 --> 13:03.165
and, boom, everybody's happy.

13:03.208 --> 13:05.775
Yeah, the only problem
is Pompom ran out of here,

13:05.803 --> 13:06.819
and I have no idea where he is.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.804
Well, knowing Pompom, he's probably

13:08.840 --> 13:10.506
out doing something weirder than shit.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.074
All right, I'm gonna go try to find

13:12.109 --> 13:13.876
whatever rock he crawled under.

13:13.911 --> 13:15.010
Can you stall?

13:15.046 --> 13:16.846
Some would argue that's
what I do for a living.

13:20.685 --> 13:23.219
You guys seen Pompom? Anybody?

13:23.254 --> 13:24.920
Guys? Have you seen Pompom?

13:24.956 --> 13:27.089
Julia James... How's my favorite owner?

13:27.124 --> 13:29.124
Uh, not great, Gary. Not great.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.860
Attendance was really light today,

13:30.895 --> 13:32.161
and now I see why.

13:32.196 --> 13:34.063
Can't compete with free money.

13:34.098 --> 13:36.232
Yeah, we're just doing
a little positive P.R.

13:36.267 --> 13:37.466
for Pennsylvania Shale.

13:37.501 --> 13:38.868
We got to coordinate on
this kind of thing, though,

13:38.903 --> 13:41.303
'cause weekend ticket sales make my nut.

13:41.339 --> 13:42.404
Oh, sorry about that.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.839
This one came up kind of fast, you know?

13:43.875 --> 13:45.741
Two or three puppies
were born without legs,

13:45.776 --> 13:47.343
and everybody plays the blame game.

13:47.378 --> 13:50.212
That's really my job at Pennsylvania
Shale, you know, to put out fires.

13:50.248 --> 13:52.781
Oh, you guys gonna finally put
out that fire on Euclid Avenue?

13:52.817 --> 13:55.651
Metaphorical fires...
The literal fire on Euclid

13:55.686 --> 13:58.534
will be burning long after
we've left this earth.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.856
What the shit?

14:00.892 --> 14:02.091
There's one of these events scheduled

14:02.126 --> 14:03.425
for every Frackers home game.

14:03.461 --> 14:04.526
Hm.

14:04.562 --> 14:05.661
I don't have the
schedule in front of me,

14:05.696 --> 14:07.196
so I'm gonna have to
take your word on that.

14:07.231 --> 14:10.165
Jesus Christ, you goddamn piece of shit!

14:10.201 --> 14:12.167
Pennsylvania Shale's
trying to ruin the season,

14:12.203 --> 14:13.502
and you're helping them!

14:13.537 --> 14:15.337
Jules, I'm not gonna lie to you.

14:18.009 --> 14:19.074
Hey, guess what!

14:19.110 --> 14:20.843
You don't know who you're messing with!

14:20.878 --> 14:24.680
I'm gonna Lucy them
right in their asses!

14:24.715 --> 14:25.714
Pompom!

14:25.750 --> 14:27.650
- Hm? Hi, Ms. James.
- We got to go.

14:27.685 --> 14:29.385
This way.

14:29.420 --> 14:31.353
- Yeah, let's hustle, okay?
- All right.

14:31.389 --> 14:33.522
We don't want the kittens
to come out of the basket.

14:33.557 --> 14:35.291
So, why did Hitler invade Russia

14:35.326 --> 14:37.893
and voluntarily start
a war on two fronts?

14:37.929 --> 14:40.496
Well, he was still basically
the same reckless man

14:40.531 --> 14:42.360
from the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923.

14:42.407 --> 14:44.867
He let impatience overwhelm strategy.

14:44.902 --> 14:46.936
Oh, um, anywhoodles, the point is this.

14:46.971 --> 14:48.470
If you're gonna chew tobacco,

14:48.506 --> 14:50.940
don't let it get all over the floor.
That's what Hitler would've done.

14:50.975 --> 14:53.943
Uh, quick side bar, then I'm
gonna call my final witness.

14:56.047 --> 14:57.279
What? What's the matter with you?

14:57.315 --> 14:59.381
No, nothing... just
Pennsylvania Shale's trying

14:59.417 --> 15:02.551
to destroy me, and also Gary's evil.

15:02.586 --> 15:04.720
So, go ahead and gloat.
You were right about him.

15:04.755 --> 15:06.755
Oh, no, no, now, you
think I'm the kind of guy

15:06.791 --> 15:08.090
that likes to say, "I told you so,"

15:08.125 --> 15:09.258
but that's not true.

15:09.293 --> 15:11.293
I love to say it, and I will be doing so

15:11.329 --> 15:13.462
in the days and months
ahead at random moments

15:13.497 --> 15:14.691
when you least expect it.

15:14.762 --> 15:16.632
We got 20 minutes till the next game.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.500
Can we wrap this up, please?

15:18.536 --> 15:20.169
- All right, a quick question...
- Yeah.

15:20.204 --> 15:21.937
When you and Pompom were walking back,

15:21.973 --> 15:23.939
did you talk at all
about how I told you so?

15:23.975 --> 15:25.975
And it begins.

15:26.010 --> 15:27.276
All right, I call Pompom.

15:28.746 --> 15:31.480
All right, Stanton has
testified that he thought

15:31.515 --> 15:33.382
you told Yoshi to bean the pitcher.

15:33.417 --> 15:35.045
But what did you actually say?

15:35.155 --> 15:37.252
I told Yoshi to bean the pitcher.

15:37.288 --> 15:38.287
Mm.

15:38.322 --> 15:39.811
Then, I said if he didn't,

15:39.850 --> 15:42.092
he might permanently
alienate his teammates.

15:42.162 --> 15:43.993
Now, I remember it
well because there was

15:44.028 --> 15:46.628
a middle-aged woman
slowly eating a corn dog

15:46.664 --> 15:49.198
in the stands behind him, and
I filed the whole thing away

15:49.233 --> 15:50.432
in my spank bank.

15:50.468 --> 15:53.068
Compelling testimony.

15:53.104 --> 15:54.903
Look, he says that that conversation,

15:54.939 --> 15:56.005
it never happened.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.474
Well, then, Szechuan Sam is lying.

16:05.014 --> 16:06.480
Yoshi says that he refuses to play

16:06.516 --> 16:08.048
for any team that calls him a liar.

16:08.137 --> 16:10.019
_

16:10.160 --> 16:12.027
_

16:12.356 --> 16:13.832
_

16:15.359 --> 16:17.426
- Yoshi, he quits.
- Yoshi! Yoshi!

16:17.461 --> 16:18.994
Yoshi, we can work something out!

16:19.030 --> 16:20.662
Oh, boy.

16:20.698 --> 16:22.464
Your best player leaving on the same day

16:22.500 --> 16:25.034
that a billion-dollar
company declares war on you.

16:25.069 --> 16:27.302
That has got to be a
kick in the kitty cat.

16:27.338 --> 16:30.139
I think the important thing
here is, though, that I helped.

16:30.174 --> 16:32.141
Why is that important?

16:32.176 --> 16:33.942
Because I didn't have to.

16:35.137 --> 16:37.672
I just don't get how
Pompom and Yoshi can have

16:37.708 --> 16:40.244
such wildly different versions
of the same exact conversation.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.577
I mean, it was just the two of them.

16:44.147 --> 16:45.413
Wait, the... The three of them,

16:45.502 --> 16:47.369
because the translator
had to be there, right?

16:50.887 --> 16:52.386
Oh!

16:52.511 --> 16:54.159
Oh, shit! Wait.

16:54.237 --> 16:55.761
Did I just solve it?

16:55.863 --> 16:57.296
I think that you did, yeah.

16:57.331 --> 16:59.265
I knew it. I knew I solved it.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.667
Look at me on my "Law
& Order: SVU" type shit.

17:01.702 --> 17:03.135
Just set me up, and
I knocked it out like,

17:03.170 --> 17:05.771
- "These are their stories."
- Yeah, very nice.

17:05.806 --> 17:07.640
But for the record,
when I tell this story,

17:07.675 --> 17:09.008
I'm gonna be the one that solves it.

17:09.042 --> 17:11.362
It's just it's gonna
flow better that way.

17:11.433 --> 17:14.046
Hey, hey, cut the bull...
Hey! Cut the bullshit.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.849
Why are you trying to take
away Yoshi's last chance?

17:17.885 --> 17:19.617
I had to get him to quit.

17:19.654 --> 17:21.587
I cannot live here.

17:21.622 --> 17:25.624
Just 10 minutes ago, I
saw a child who was so fat

17:25.660 --> 17:27.926
that he could not get up off his back.

17:27.962 --> 17:29.662
H-He look like a-a tortoise.

17:29.697 --> 17:31.764
Holy shit, is that kid still there?

17:31.799 --> 17:33.165
Oh, yeah.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.467
You didn't try to help
him up either, huh?

17:35.503 --> 17:37.770
Oh, no, ugh. H-He looked very sticky.

17:37.805 --> 17:39.872
Hai, hai.

17:39.907 --> 17:41.574
- Among other things.
- _

17:43.544 --> 17:47.179
Look, I know you feel the
same as I do about this town.

17:47.214 --> 17:49.181
Every game, I listen to you get drunk

17:49.216 --> 17:51.216
to deal with the reality
that you are trapped

17:51.252 --> 17:52.551
here in this place.

17:52.587 --> 17:55.220
No, no, I just have a
drinking problem, friend.

17:55.256 --> 17:57.990
But you're not wrong. This town is...

17:58.025 --> 17:59.792
a gaping shit hole.

17:59.827 --> 18:00.893
So...

18:00.928 --> 18:03.762
So, why do you care what happens here?

18:05.533 --> 18:07.933
And that was the moment
that I realized that I cared.

18:07.969 --> 18:09.001
Why did I care?

18:09.036 --> 18:10.669
Because I was finally part of a team.

18:10.705 --> 18:12.705
I didn't mean to join it, but, you know,

18:12.740 --> 18:14.673
when you care about one
person, then you start to care

18:14.709 --> 18:17.042
about who they care about,
and on and on that goes

18:17.078 --> 18:19.378
until you look around
one day and you realize

18:19.413 --> 18:21.947
that there's a group of people
you'd actually fight for,

18:21.983 --> 18:23.782
and that goes for
everybody in this room.

18:23.818 --> 18:25.250
We are all part of a team.

18:25.286 --> 18:28.153
Look, I live my life very selfishly.

18:28.189 --> 18:30.122
The last teammate I had, I betrayed him.

18:30.157 --> 18:31.333
Why?

18:31.380 --> 18:34.560
Because of ambition and my own
very narrow-minded views on sex.

18:34.595 --> 18:36.795
But with age and experience,
I've come to realize, fellas,

18:36.831 --> 18:38.697
that sexuality is...

18:38.733 --> 18:39.965
Well, it's really more of a spectrum.

18:40.001 --> 18:41.600
Yes, it is. No, it is.

18:41.636 --> 18:43.602
Guys, one time when I was in Estonia...

18:43.638 --> 18:45.371
No, no, no, just stay with me on this.

18:45.406 --> 18:47.973
I was hiking through the
forest, and I came upon

18:48.009 --> 18:50.843
what must've been a
cruising spot for gay men.

18:50.878 --> 18:52.511
In the center of this clearing was

18:52.546 --> 18:53.679
what could best be described as...

18:53.714 --> 18:55.247
Well, it was a stump...

18:55.282 --> 18:58.450
Ohh! ... worn smooth from years
of casual anonymous encounters.

18:58.486 --> 19:01.253
- That is enough of that!
- Guys... guys after guys...

19:01.288 --> 19:03.555
All right, we are already
10 minutes late for warm ups.

19:03.591 --> 19:04.890
Let's get on the field!

19:09.063 --> 19:13.098
Let's go! Come on now!

19:13.134 --> 19:16.402
Yoshi, my friend, are you joining us?

19:16.437 --> 19:18.170
Ah.

19:18.329 --> 19:19.555
_

19:19.814 --> 19:22.368
_

19:22.998 --> 19:25.646
_

19:26.271 --> 19:31.877
_

19:33.754 --> 19:35.587
- Yeah, he's real happy to be here.
- Ah!

19:35.623 --> 19:37.289
Look, the truth is I speak Japanese

19:37.324 --> 19:38.857
at a third-grade level,
so you're gonna have

19:38.893 --> 19:40.492
- to get somebody else to translate.
- That's okay.

19:40.528 --> 19:42.828
I am just so glad
something finally broke

19:42.863 --> 19:44.296
my way today and
everything got resolved.

19:44.331 --> 19:46.928
- All right.
- No, no, no, no, Miss Jules.

19:46.983 --> 19:49.435
Mnh-mnh.

19:49.470 --> 19:50.803
What can I do for you, my friend?

19:50.838 --> 19:54.506
I still don't have payback
for the Summerville pitcher.

19:57.178 --> 19:59.845
I actually have an idea about that.

20:03.684 --> 20:06.251
Now, your mom didn't say
it was an emergency exactly,

20:06.287 --> 20:08.487
but it did sound kind of important.

20:08.522 --> 20:10.989
So, just go straight back
there. You'll see a phone.

20:11.025 --> 20:12.891
Straight back. Keep going.

20:14.028 --> 20:15.961
Yoshi Takatsu? I am a big fan.

20:15.996 --> 20:17.706
Whoa!

20:18.784 --> 20:19.565
- Charles.
- Mm-hmm?

20:19.600 --> 20:22.267
I just want to say I'm sorry
if I went a little overboard

20:22.303 --> 20:24.336
on all of that gay stuff, you know?

20:24.371 --> 20:27.709
The truth is everybody in your
generation seems gay to me.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.568
But I want you to know...

20:29.642 --> 20:30.706
Ooh!

20:30.711 --> 20:32.911
- I want you to know, Charles...
- Hm?

20:32.947 --> 20:35.848
... that whatever you become, I
think it's gonna be really special.

20:35.883 --> 20:37.516
You know why? 'Cause you're smart

20:37.551 --> 20:39.118
- and you don't take any shit, son...
- Hey, whoa!

20:39.153 --> 20:41.053
... and that's exactly
what you need to navigate

20:41.102 --> 20:43.001
the cold chaos of this world.

20:43.065 --> 20:44.283
Aah!

20:44.525 --> 20:46.158
Aaah!

20:46.193 --> 20:47.793
T-Thank you.

20:47.828 --> 20:49.128
You're killing me!

20:49.163 --> 20:51.029
Thank you!

20:51.065 --> 20:53.265
- "Ooshi," no!
- We should... We should... Let's...

20:53.300 --> 20:56.335
Let's... Yeah. Let's get
out of here. Hurry up.

20:56.370 --> 21:00.072
You know, this whole thing
has showed me that you and I,

21:00.107 --> 21:02.107
w-we're kind of a team, too.

21:02.143 --> 21:03.675
We're kind of like...

21:03.711 --> 21:06.779
We're kind of like
boyfriend and girlfriend.

21:06.814 --> 21:08.647
Yeah, I know, Jim.

21:08.682 --> 21:10.849
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

21:10.885 --> 21:12.518
How long have you known that?

21:12.553 --> 21:14.453
Mm...

21:14.488 --> 21:16.155
when I stopped paying
for your hotel room

21:16.190 --> 21:18.991
'cause you were sleeping
at my apartment every night.

21:19.026 --> 21:21.627
So, wait. A-Are we living together?

21:22.696 --> 21:25.097
If it offends your
delicate sensibilities,

21:25.132 --> 21:27.599
you can tell yourself you're squatting.

21:27.635 --> 21:29.101
I need a beer.

21:29.136 --> 21:30.769
- I'll grab you one.
- No, that's all right.

21:30.805 --> 21:31.737
Dale!

21:40.514 --> 21:41.947
Goddamn, you are beautiful.

21:51.225 --> 21:53.207
Lucy?
