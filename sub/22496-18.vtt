<i>It's alive!</i>

00:33.590 --> 00:35.480
<b>7x18 - "The Hobbit: There and Bennigans"</b>

00:35.517 --> 00:37.817
Honey, why don't you just try

00:37.819 --> 00:39.686
- counting sheep?
- Does that really work?

00:39.688 --> 00:41.888
Just give it a try.

00:41.890 --> 00:48.194
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

00:48.196 --> 00:51.531
...7, 8, 9, 10!
Move it, sheep! Jump, jump!

00:51.533 --> 00:54.106
Listen up.
You have one job ...

00:54.182 --> 00:58.104
to help humans fall asleep.
Fail and we'll turn your asses

00:58.106 --> 01:00.807
Into lamb chops!
11, you're late!

01:00.809 --> 01:06.045
My name is Samuel.

01:06.047 --> 01:08.748
Now, let that be a lesson to
all you ...

01:08.750 --> 01:11.484
- My name is Samuel.
- My name is Samuel.

01:11.486 --> 01:13.920
- My name is Samuel!
- What the the [bleep]

01:13.922 --> 01:16.222
All right, stay ... stay back!
Stay back!

01:19.627 --> 01:22.895
- Hey, how'd you sleep?
- Eh, fine.

01:23.897 --> 01:26.399
You're pretty good, Misty.

01:26.401 --> 01:29.635
Better than you, Ash.
Oh, darn!

01:29.637 --> 01:32.739
Ash! Why have we been playing
tennis with a pokéball?

01:32.741 --> 01:35.262
Pikachu pissed on my rug.

01:39.047 --> 01:40.103
Damn right.

01:42.217 --> 01:45.084
Hold my oakleys!

01:45.086 --> 01:50.123
- Huh!
- No, no, no, no!

01:55.122 --> 01:59.565
Get your penis out
of the vacuum cleaner.

01:59.567 --> 02:02.635
Family, after nearly killing
you on a ski trip to the

02:02.637 --> 02:06.394
Himalayas, I saved your lives by
giving each of you bionic implants.

02:06.395 --> 02:10.309
Let's use these cool new
powers as the Bionic Six!

02:10.311 --> 02:13.913
Uh, hon, maybe we should be
grateful we're alive and not ...

02:13.915 --> 02:16.783
<i>- The Bionic Six!
- Open wide!</i>

02:16.785 --> 02:20.086
You just got eighty-Bionic-sixed!

02:21.331 --> 02:25.057
Dad, turns out hitting homers
isn't a superpower.

02:25.059 --> 02:26.542
<i>Bionic Five!</i>

02:26.543 --> 02:29.395
- Eric?
- Uh, his code name is Sports-1.

02:29.397 --> 02:32.398
He's our son and he's dead,
you asshole!

02:32.400 --> 02:35.668
- We're getting a divorce.
- Bionic Four!

02:37.105 --> 02:39.605
<i>- Bionic Three!
- You killed my brother!</i>

02:40.007 --> 02:41.741
<i>Bionic Two!</i>

02:41.743 --> 02:45.044
We never had any training!

02:45.046 --> 02:46.393
<i>Bionic One!</i>

02:46.394 --> 02:51.152
Only now do I see that
Bionics solve nothing.

02:51.580 --> 02:53.619
<i>I am out of work!</i>

02:54.154 --> 02:57.023
It is every parent's worst
nightmare to outlive their child.

02:57.025 --> 03:01.260
I will treasure each of the years
I had with my sweet, beloved Andrew.

03:01.262 --> 03:03.196
Hold my oakleys, brah.

03:03.197 --> 03:09.468
Andrew was way too pussy to
surf a wave like this. Yeah!

03:10.003 --> 03:11.604
I'm sorry, Professor Dumbledore.

03:11.606 --> 03:15.508
This curse is at stage 4.
You only have six months to live.

03:15.510 --> 03:17.376
But try to look on the bright side.

03:17.378 --> 03:20.513
You're a highly educated wizard.
I'm sure you've done something

03:20.515 --> 03:23.783
- really great with your life.
- I teach high school.

03:23.785 --> 03:27.720
Oh.
Well, I'll leave you alone to cry.

03:30.056 --> 03:33.359
Scalpus badassus.

03:43.370 --> 03:47.073
We will create a money-making
potion to fund your war with

03:47.075 --> 03:50.977
- Voldemort long after I'm gone.
- Wolfsbane, fluxweed,

03:50.979 --> 03:54.947
20 packages of sudafed?
This sounds like the dark arts.

03:54.949 --> 03:57.750
It's what your parents
would've wanted, Harry.

03:57.752 --> 04:00.419
- I'll do it!
- Well done, Ms. Granger.

04:00.421 --> 04:04.924
Your batch is 99% pure.
And Mr. Weasley...

04:04.926 --> 04:08.516
Oh, no! Ron!
The most useless of our trio!

04:08.551 --> 04:10.887
Relax, Hermione.
Untrained students mixing

04:10.888 --> 04:13.766
potentially fatal potions
are no big deal at Hogwarts.

04:13.768 --> 04:17.702
See? He's perf...
Oh, my god!

04:17.704 --> 04:20.039
Children, have you learned
nothing from your annual

04:20.041 --> 04:22.875
near-death adventures?
Magic heals anything.

04:22.877 --> 04:26.178
Makes it hard to care about the
consequences, frankly.

04:26.180 --> 04:27.617
He'll be good as new!

04:34.121 --> 04:36.756
I don't think so, Harry.
Professor Snape said he wouldn't

04:36.758 --> 04:38.691
drink your potions with
Bea Arthur's dick.

04:38.693 --> 04:39.748
- Yeah.
- Yeah, come on.

04:39.783 --> 04:42.228
Quick! Use the magic words
Dumbledore gave us!

04:42.230 --> 04:43.829
<i>The first taste is free!</i>

04:43.831 --> 04:46.299
You know, I always thought
Bea Arthur was attractive.

04:46.301 --> 04:49.101
Okay, class.
As you know from your reading,

04:49.103 --> 04:52.138
a Hydra's temperature can only be
taken rectally.

04:52.140 --> 04:55.574
Any volunteers? Children?
By Merlin's merkin!

04:56.488 --> 05:01.447
Hagrid is going to blow the lid
off our entire operation, professor!

05:01.449 --> 05:03.971
I knew hiring a
12-foot-tall mongoloid

05:03.972 --> 05:06.752
would bite me in the
ass one day. I'm on it.

05:06.754 --> 05:09.188
I'm home, Fang!
Come here, boy!

05:09.190 --> 05:12.391
Fang!

05:12.393 --> 05:14.293
I did it! Now I can...

05:14.295 --> 05:17.330
I got hit with a stray shell.

05:17.332 --> 05:22.739
Seems kind of arbitrary after such
a tightly plotted rise to infamy.

05:30.444 --> 05:33.346
One man can be pretty dumb

05:33.348 --> 05:36.682
sometimes, but for real
bona fide stupidity, there ain't

05:36.684 --> 05:39.852
nothing can beat teamwork.

05:48.363 --> 05:50.488
Another perfect giraffe!

05:50.489 --> 05:53.030
Oh, no.
That's too good to waste.

05:53.031 --> 05:55.301
Hey, where's that birthday boy?

05:55.636 --> 05:58.771
Can ... can I hold my baby?

05:58.773 --> 06:01.240
You can hold your baby's oakleys.

06:07.647 --> 06:10.383
I finally figured out what's

06:10.385 --> 06:13.452
wrong with you, Otis ...
male cows don't have udders.

06:13.454 --> 06:16.555
Uh, right.
And neither do I.

06:16.557 --> 06:19.859
I was born a hermaphrodite?
I, uh...

06:19.861 --> 06:22.561
Oh, sweet cud. I'm a girl.
You got me.

06:22.563 --> 06:24.630
Oh, my god.

06:24.632 --> 06:27.533
Was that a strap-on or ...
Oh, was that your hoof?!

06:27.535 --> 06:29.114
What? You want to hate me for

06:29.115 --> 06:30.631
pretending to be
something I'm not?

06:30.689 --> 06:33.706
Fine. Then, Abby, cows
don't have blond hair!

06:33.708 --> 06:37.052
 And, Bessie,
cows can't walk on two legs.

06:37.053 --> 06:38.878
Our knees should explode under

06:38.880 --> 06:40.980
- this much weight.
- Ow!

06:40.982 --> 06:44.583
Fantasy looks pretty good

06:44.585 --> 06:47.586
now, huh, you judgmental bitches?!

06:48.121 --> 06:49.622
My balls!

06:49.624 --> 06:51.123
My vagina!

06:51.125 --> 06:53.826
Am I doing this wrong?
I think I'm doing this wrong.

06:54.328 --> 06:58.297
<i>Dear mother, I take pen in
hand to inform you that, today,</i>

06:58.299 --> 07:01.167
<i>your son, Private
Pizza, became a killer.</i>

07:01.169 --> 07:04.203
<i>Our platoon was on dawn patrol
when the enemy hit us.</i>

07:04.205 --> 07:08.174
- Ambush! We got a...
- Bullets started flying and, in

07:08.176 --> 07:11.177
<i>that moment, I couldn't tell my
fellow kitchen commandos</i>

07:11.179 --> 07:13.746
<i>apart from our enemy,
the refrigerator rejects.</i>

07:13.748 --> 07:18.584
<i>I felt powerless, until I saw
that greasy bastard killing</i>

07:18.586 --> 07:22.221
<i>Major Munch.
A rage overtook me, and I gave</i>

07:22.223 --> 07:25.191
<i>that fried freak
a closed-casket funeral.</i>

07:25.193 --> 07:27.993
<i>I can't remember why we fight anymore.</i>

07:27.995 --> 07:32.098
<i>I pray that someday this war
ends, a day when there is no</i>

07:32.100 --> 07:34.518
<i>meat drawer, no veggie crisper,</i>

07:34.519 --> 07:38.899
<i>just food and food alike in one
fridge, together.</i>

07:38.900 --> 07:41.841
Until that day, I am your son,

07:41.843 --> 07:45.111
Private Pizza, 1st battalion,
kitchen commandos.

07:46.546 --> 07:51.041
Suicide taco! Get down!

07:52.185 --> 07:54.487
Nobody wins...

07:54.489 --> 07:58.245
...in a food fight.

08:02.646 --> 08:06.449
Let us begin this journey for
the Roman Catholic church.

08:06.451 --> 08:09.371
Let us allow gays to
marry and maybe shut up

08:09.372 --> 08:12.421
once in a while about
abortion. Hold my oakleys.

08:12.423 --> 08:14.036
Hey!

08:15.525 --> 08:19.161
So, Rapunzel, does the carpet
match the drapes?

08:19.163 --> 08:22.765
Mm, you tell me.
You just climbed up the carpet.

08:23.767 --> 08:26.736
Cobra has developed a
mind-control energy drink.

08:26.738 --> 08:29.567
It even looks and smells
like asparagus piss, just

08:29.568 --> 08:32.341
like the real thing. Cobra
is giving it away at the

08:32.342 --> 08:36.044
X games, so ... never thought I'd
say this ... this is a mission

08:36.047 --> 08:39.284
for G.I. Joe... extreme.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.450
<i>Extreme!</i>

08:41.452 --> 08:43.486
Ballistic, grab the mountain dew!

08:43.488 --> 08:45.655
Metal-head, crank up the smash mouth!

08:45.657 --> 08:49.225
So, Duke, I got to ask ...
why does G.I. Joe have a unit

08:49.227 --> 08:51.894
- for extreme tasks?
- Eh, it was the '90s.

08:51.896 --> 08:54.891
Harpoon, talk to the hand!
Not!

08:56.567 --> 08:59.468
Do I spy a ninja with
bleached blond hair?

08:59.470 --> 09:00.927
It's frosted tips, brah!

09:00.928 --> 09:03.572
I'm bustin' moves, extreme style!
Go-Gurt!

09:03.574 --> 09:05.234
Remember, you're undercover.

09:05.235 --> 09:08.177
- Don't call attention to yourselves.
- You heard the bro!

09:08.179 --> 09:11.314
- Chillax, you Ally McBeals!
- Oh, you son of a ...

09:11.316 --> 09:14.283
Take it easy, boss.

09:14.285 --> 09:18.925
Listen up, fellow youth.
Snakebite energy drinks are not cool!

09:19.524 --> 09:22.024
Or dope.

09:22.026 --> 09:25.127
I am sold!
It's ironic viral marketing!

09:25.129 --> 09:29.171
- Let's get a Snakebite!
- Don't worry, dawg. I got this.

09:29.206 --> 09:32.902
Who wants in?
Pretty sick, huh?

09:32.904 --> 09:37.707
I got devil sticks, too.

09:37.709 --> 09:39.909
- Let's get a Snakebite!
- No fear!

09:39.911 --> 09:42.611
No! We got to take it to the
extreme!

09:42.613 --> 09:43.946
Black Dragon?

09:43.947 --> 09:49.118
- Who wants to see some gnarly shredding?
- Uh, that's a steep half-pipe.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.587
- Where's that ninja's helmet?
- Don't need one.

09:51.589 --> 09:56.746
- Homey's got frosted tips!
- Say no to Snakebite energy drink!

09:56.747 --> 09:58.327
Show me the money!

10:00.932 --> 10:03.966
Well, time for the most
extreme option!

10:03.968 --> 10:06.469
Target my location.
Let the dogs out.

10:06.471 --> 10:10.373
Oh, my gosh. Did you
call an air strike on us?

10:10.375 --> 10:13.075
- Well, seems a little ...
- Say it!

10:13.077 --> 10:15.945
Extreme.

10:15.947 --> 10:19.015
Due to your extreme negligence...

10:19.017 --> 10:20.517
