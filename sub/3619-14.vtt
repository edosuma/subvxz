WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.655
[baby crying]Yeah, I get that, Rex,

00:03.829 --> 00:06.136
but I need you at the club,
you're supposed to be there.

00:06.310 --> 00:08.791
Valentine's Day is gonna be
a very busy night.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.967
Can't you ask her
to marry you on another night?

00:11.141 --> 00:12.316
Get off that phone.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.014
You know what, I'll handle it.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.363
Good luck.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.104
I hope she says no.

00:17.278 --> 00:20.150
Take a look at this.
This is the new face of evil.

00:20.324 --> 00:22.196
His name is John Normand
and he owns the phone company,

00:22.370 --> 00:23.719
and he's been stealing
from us for months.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.112
Uh-huh.

00:25.286 --> 00:26.243
Doesn't that just
make you angry?

00:26.417 --> 00:27.897
Not really.

00:28.071 --> 00:30.378
Wait, he's been stealing from us

00:30.552 --> 00:32.336
and he's probably gonna
get away with it

00:32.510 --> 00:34.164
due to some loophole
or something.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.123
Phoebe, I'm a little more
worried about the actual demons

00:36.297 --> 00:38.864
in the world, you know the ones
that we almost got rid of.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.823
Yeah, well, there's nothing
we can do about them.

00:40.997 --> 00:42.694
we tried to save the world,
it didn't work.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.479
The demons are gonna attack
when they're gonna attack.

00:44.653 --> 00:46.176
And when they do,

00:46.350 --> 00:48.744
we're just gonna be right back
to the same old...

00:48.918 --> 00:50.659
Wow!

00:50.833 --> 00:52.269
Whoa. You're not kidding. Wow!

00:53.792 --> 00:55.359
Okeydokey.

00:55.533 --> 00:58.536
speaking of which...

00:58.710 --> 00:59.711
Could you do me a favor

00:59.885 --> 01:01.322
and watch the boys tonight?

01:01.496 --> 01:04.064
I need Leo to help me
set up at P3,

01:04.238 --> 01:06.240
and apparently my manager
is busy proposing.

01:06.414 --> 01:07.806
Yeah, sure, of course.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.373
I mean, it's not like anyone's
proposing to me

01:09.547 --> 01:10.766
or like anyone's

01:10.940 --> 01:12.942
sending me flowers,
or reciting me poetry.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.900
So much for the little girl
I saw in my vision.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.816
Well, Phoebe, just because
the Avatars are gone,

01:17.990 --> 01:20.950
doesn't mean that
you won't still find love.

01:21.124 --> 01:22.386
Easy for you to say,
you have Leo.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.605
Yeah, but do I really?

01:23.779 --> 01:25.476
It's only a matter of time

01:25.650 --> 01:27.609
before the Elders try to punish
him for becoming an Avatar,

01:27.783 --> 01:29.089
which they practically
drove him to anyway

01:29.263 --> 01:30.916
with Gideon and everything.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.135
Well they made Kyle
a whitelighter,

01:32.309 --> 01:33.615
and that's good, right?

01:33.789 --> 01:35.965
Yeah, but it took him
away from Paige.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.402
And believe me, they got their
cosmic jollies off that one.

01:38.576 --> 01:40.012
Where is Paige?At magic school.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.536
Where else? Why?

01:41.710 --> 01:44.669
I'm just worried about her,
that's all.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.369
Really is another
great application.

01:48.543 --> 01:49.413
A muse?

01:49.587 --> 01:50.545
No, no, no, no, no.

01:50.719 --> 01:51.937
You can't hire her

01:52.112 --> 01:53.678
as the next
literature professor.

01:53.852 --> 01:56.420
She'd inspire them to write
novels instead of reading them.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.770
Oh, that's a good point.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.032
I hadn't thought of that.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.425
Well, I did.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.035
And that's why you
should hire me.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.515
What? You want
to be a teacher?

02:04.689 --> 02:06.169
Well, isn't it time I moved up?

02:06.343 --> 02:07.779
Besides, I had
a great rapport

02:07.953 --> 02:09.738
with the last literature
professor.

02:09.912 --> 02:12.001
You hated that little gnome.
You were arguing with him

02:12.175 --> 02:13.698
five minutes before
he was killed.

02:13.872 --> 02:14.830
Well...

02:15.004 --> 02:16.136
that was our way.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.354
Besides, if the
truth were told,

02:17.528 --> 02:18.921
you'd want me to
have the job,

02:19.095 --> 02:21.010
I'm very well read.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.881
It takes more than that though.

02:23.055 --> 02:24.927
It takes being able to really
connect with the students.

02:25.101 --> 02:26.972
I can do that.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.062
In fact, I've got some tricks
you don't even know about.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.890
[groans]

02:37.331 --> 02:39.246
Did you astral project?

02:39.420 --> 02:42.118
Mrs. Winterbourne taught me
before she went on sabbatical.

02:42.292 --> 02:45.817
Don't worry, I'll
get used to it.

02:45.991 --> 02:50.126
Trust me, I am the best
candidate for this job.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.128
[engine roaring]What the hell is...?

02:59.440 --> 03:01.616
That's gonna leave a mark.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.662
Sorry about the table.

03:04.836 --> 03:05.837
Are you okay?

03:07.622 --> 03:08.753
Who are you?

03:08.927 --> 03:12.670
I'm the new teacher.

03:24.943 --> 03:28.077
♪ I am the son ♪

03:28.251 --> 03:32.168
♪ And the heir ♪

03:32.342 --> 03:38.566

04:08.639 --> 04:11.120
You ride in here
and nearly kill us,

04:11.294 --> 04:12.948
and now you want to teach here?

04:13.122 --> 04:14.863
If I wanted to teach
parallel parking

04:15.037 --> 04:17.300
you might have a point, but I'm
here for the literature post.

04:17.474 --> 04:18.823
And what do you know
about literature?

04:18.997 --> 04:21.217
Plenty.

04:21.391 --> 04:22.566
My resume.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.788
Drake. Huh.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.746
Well, maybe you should
have sent this in

04:28.920 --> 04:30.748
so you didn't, uh,
waste your time.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.097
Oh, I never waste my time.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.187
"For life is but
a walking shadow,

04:35.362 --> 04:36.406
"the poor player who struts

04:36.580 --> 04:38.495
"and frets his hour

04:38.669 --> 04:39.801
"and then is heard no more.

04:39.975 --> 04:40.845
It is a tale..."

04:41.019 --> 04:41.803
"tale told..."

04:41.977 --> 04:42.804
Take it, sister.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.066
"...by an idiot,

04:44.240 --> 04:45.589
"full of sound

04:45.763 --> 04:47.722

04:47.896 --> 04:49.637
...nothing."

04:49.811 --> 04:51.029
You two aren't gonna make
this easy for me.

04:51.203 --> 04:52.248
Oh, come on, what are
you talking about?

04:52.422 --> 04:53.467
There's no contest.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.207
It's all right
there in my resume.

04:55.382 --> 04:58.167
I studied at Julliard,
performed on Broadway,

04:58.341 --> 04:59.647
and I was penning a memoir

04:59.821 --> 05:01.692
that I intend to finish
on my deathbed.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.172
Oh, I look forward
to reading that.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.000
Well, thank you very much.

05:05.174 --> 05:07.394
Why aren't any of these credits
more than a year long?

05:07.568 --> 05:09.352
Simple really--
before that, I was a demon.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.180
What?! A demon?

05:11.354 --> 05:12.964
Was a demon. Now human.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.532
Okay, and how exactly
did that happen?

05:15.706 --> 05:16.968
Personally I hate
exposition, but if...

05:17.142 --> 05:18.492
All right, uh...

05:18.666 --> 05:20.581
50 weeks ago I made a deal
with a Sorcerer,

05:20.755 --> 05:21.625
he made me human.

05:21.799 --> 05:23.192
Just like that?

05:23.366 --> 05:25.020
Well, there were
a few minor stipulations.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.283
You know, first of all,

05:27.457 --> 05:29.459
I get to keep my powers
and, uh...

05:29.633 --> 05:33.811
if I use them in any offensive
manner, he gets them and...

05:33.985 --> 05:35.247
I burn for
all eternity.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.553
What are you
waiting for?

05:36.727 --> 05:37.598
Vanquish him.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.121
Vanq... Lady.

05:39.295 --> 05:40.992
Vanquish.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.430
Look, I just want a chance
to make up for my demon days.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.301
If you don't
believe me,

05:45.475 --> 05:47.347
then research me,
look into my history.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.697
I've got almost nothing to hide.

05:49.871 --> 05:53.091
We'll see about that.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.310
Miss Donovan, where
are you going?

05:54.484 --> 05:56.399
To prove that
he's dangerous.

05:56.573 --> 05:59.315
If that is safety,
then I am dangerous.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.839
Boy, is she gonna be sorry
when I get the job, right?

06:02.013 --> 06:05.234
Not so fast, Mr. Pompadour
Motorcycle Guy.

06:05.408 --> 06:08.455
I don't know what
to make of you.

06:08.629 --> 06:12.284
Why don't we consult
the Book of Shadows?All right?

06:14.504 --> 06:16.158
Okay, next.

06:16.332 --> 06:17.246
That one's ripped.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.422
So? The crowd will be, too.

06:19.596 --> 06:21.772
Actually this is taking far too
long, where's my staple gun?

06:21.946 --> 06:23.078
Staple gun?

06:23.252 --> 06:24.601
Since when do you
staple decorations?

06:24.775 --> 06:25.863
Don't you want
everything to be perfect?

06:26.037 --> 06:27.474
What's the point?

06:27.648 --> 06:28.605
It's all gonna be torn down
tomorrow anyway.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.128
Well, the point is

06:30.302 --> 06:31.434
is not worry about
what's gonna happen tomorrow.

06:31.608 --> 06:32.740
The point is

06:32.914 --> 06:34.219
to stop and enjoy
Valentine's Day.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.134
Well some people can't forget.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.659
Some people would rather see
the rips and the flaws,

06:38.833 --> 06:40.443
so that they're not
totally devastated

06:40.617 --> 06:42.489
when they're all torn down
suddenly tomorrow.

06:42.663 --> 06:46.057
We're not talking about
decorations any more, are we?

06:46.231 --> 06:47.972
Look, Leo, I'm sorry,

06:48.146 --> 06:49.626
but I can't just stand here
and pretend

06:49.800 --> 06:52.455
like everything is
not falling apart... again.

06:52.629 --> 06:55.153
We both know that the Elders
are not gonna be easy on you.

06:55.327 --> 06:56.459
Well, when you change
the world,

06:56.633 --> 06:58.505
you gotta expect consequences.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.637
Says who? The Elders brought
this on themselves.

07:00.811 --> 07:02.770
It's just as much their fault
as it is ours,

07:02.944 --> 07:04.467
maybe even more so.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.556
Well, I'm the one that chose
to become an Avatar.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.123
I betrayed them.

07:08.297 --> 07:10.168
Because they drove you to it,
with Gideon,

07:10.342 --> 07:11.605
what he did to Chris

07:11.779 --> 07:13.476
and what he tried
to do to Wyatt.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.609
Yeah, I don't think
they're gonna see it that way.

07:15.783 --> 07:18.089
Well, you need to make them
see it that way or else

07:18.263 --> 07:20.701
this may be the last Valentine's
Day we spend together.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.881
Your leads are worthless,
bounty hunter.

07:27.055 --> 07:28.926
I'm not the one who lost
Drake in the first place.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.841
That was you, Sorcerer.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.844
Well, I never dreamt I
need to keep tabs on him.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.586
By now I thought he would have
used his powers for sure.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.414
And yet he hasn't.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.416
He's stronger than I thought.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.940
Which is why you must find him

07:43.114 --> 07:45.465
so I can force him
to give in to temptation.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.118
But we are running out of time.

07:47.292 --> 07:51.122
In more ways than
one, Mr. Rathbone.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.255
Zankou is moving in to
take over the underworld.

07:53.429 --> 07:55.649
If I expect to stop him,

07:55.823 --> 07:57.651
and to seize the
throne for myself,

07:57.825 --> 08:00.610
I must have Drake's powers!

08:02.743 --> 08:04.788
I'll double the bounty,
but find him.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.747
Sir. Excuse me, sir.

08:06.921 --> 08:08.488
We have a new lead.[woman struggling]

08:08.662 --> 08:11.012
A woman?
You call that a lead?

08:11.186 --> 08:14.276
We caught her in the underworld
asking questions about Drake.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.625
She may know where he is.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.671
Ah, is that so?

08:17.845 --> 08:19.237
[grunting]

08:19.411 --> 08:21.675
I don't know anything.
Let me go.

08:21.849 --> 08:26.114
Think harder, my dear.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.945
PHOEBE:
No, you cannot put me
on hold again.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.948
Now when are you gonna send me
a refund for my phone bill?

08:34.122 --> 08:36.080
What do you mean never?

08:36.254 --> 08:37.952
Look, this is...

08:38.126 --> 08:39.693
You know what, forget it.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.433
I have call waiting anyway,

08:41.608 --> 08:44.436
which you're probably
overcharging me for, right?

08:45.612 --> 08:46.482
Hello.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.179
Hey, Phoebe, it's Darryl.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.572
Darryl, shouldn't you be out
arresting that thief

08:49.746 --> 08:51.139
John Normand?

08:51.313 --> 08:52.967
Did you read the paper today?
It says that...

08:53.141 --> 08:55.186
Phoebe, we got bigger things
to worry about.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.493
Sheridan's back.

08:57.667 --> 08:58.581
What?

08:58.755 --> 09:00.191
Oh, no.

09:00.365 --> 09:01.802
Any more good news?

09:01.976 --> 09:04.065
Your friend Brody came to visit
me last night,

09:04.239 --> 09:06.937
and told me that he brought her
out of the coma.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.460
Didn't you say he died?

09:08.635 --> 09:10.724
Yeah, well,
I never said it stuck.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.203
He became a whitelighter.

09:12.377 --> 09:14.641
The point is he did some
mumbo jumbo on her

09:14.815 --> 09:16.425
where she doesn't remember
anything that happened.

09:16.599 --> 09:17.687
Well, does she remember us?

09:17.861 --> 09:19.950
I don't now yet.

09:20.124 --> 09:22.605
He told me to tell her that they
went on some undercover mission

09:22.779 --> 09:24.999
and that he died
and she wound up in a coma.

09:25.173 --> 09:27.392
Just how long do you expect her
to buy that?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.481
I don't know,
but as long as we don't

09:29.656 --> 09:31.005
trigger her memory,
we should be fine.

09:31.179 --> 09:32.659
Trigger?
What do you mean trigger?

09:32.833 --> 09:34.225
Her memory could come back
if she's reminded of it.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.576
That's why you have to
keep her away from us.

09:36.750 --> 09:37.881
PAIGE:
Phoebe,

09:38.055 --> 09:39.840
I need you upstairs.Okay. coming.

09:40.014 --> 09:42.103
Darryl, I'm sorry, I gotta go.

09:42.277 --> 09:43.713
You're just gonna have to deal
with this like the rest of us.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.280
Phoebe...

09:46.107 --> 09:47.761
Phoebe?

09:47.935 --> 09:48.892
Do I know her?

09:51.547 --> 09:53.941
I don't know. Do you?

09:56.378 --> 09:58.293
DRAKE:
There, see.

09:58.467 --> 10:01.296
Right there, you've
got nothing to fear.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.341
What are you
talking about?

10:03.515 --> 10:05.866
It says that you have the power
to fire a thermal blast

10:06.040 --> 10:07.737
that can knock out
ten demons at a time.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.347
Yeah, but I told you,

10:09.521 --> 10:10.740
if I use them, then
the Sorcerer gets them,

10:10.914 --> 10:12.786
and that would be bad.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.397
It also says that
I can be vanquished
by the Power of Three.

10:15.571 --> 10:16.441
Hello.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.487
See, right here.

10:19.488 --> 10:20.532
What?

10:20.707 --> 10:22.099
You touched it?

10:22.273 --> 10:24.014
What?You touched The Book.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.060
Oh, my God.
So I did.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.888
I guess that means
I'm good.

10:28.062 --> 10:29.367
The Book...Stop it.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.369
Maybe it does and
maybe it doesn't.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.458
The Bookhas been tricked
before.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.764
So have we.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.244
Just recently as
a matter of fact.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.072
Oh, all right, then
that explains it.

10:38.246 --> 10:39.682
So what did this mistake
cost you?

10:39.856 --> 10:42.729
A colleague?
A friend? A lover?

10:42.903 --> 10:44.252
Actually, all of the above.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.383
Hmm.

10:45.557 --> 10:46.689
No wonder you're so indecisive.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.430
I'm not indecisive.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.693
You think I'm indecisive?

10:50.867 --> 10:53.783
Paige, making mistakes
is what makes us human.

10:53.957 --> 10:57.526
Hey, sorry. I put the boys
down for a nap.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.570
Who are you?

10:58.745 --> 11:00.094
Hi.
Hi.

11:00.268 --> 11:01.356
Drake, Phoebe.
Phoebe, Drake.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.097
Uh, yeah.

11:03.271 --> 11:04.620
He's an ex-demon.What?

11:04.794 --> 11:06.317
Excuse me?

11:06.491 --> 11:08.189
Look, I thought you
guys had lots of experience

11:08.363 --> 11:09.756
with demons who were human.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.279
You married one, didn't you?

11:11.453 --> 11:13.281
Yes, and divorced.
How did you know that?

11:13.455 --> 11:16.763
You know, gossip...
around the office cauldron.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.895
Anyway,

11:19.069 --> 11:21.115
the point is, girls,
you don't know what it's like

11:21.289 --> 11:23.247
to be judge simply by the way
you were born.

11:23.421 --> 11:24.945
[with French accent]:
Look well at me

11:25.119 --> 11:26.729
and tell me,

11:26.903 --> 11:29.906
with what hope this vile
protuberance can inspire my art?

11:30.864 --> 11:31.691
He's very dramatic.

11:31.865 --> 11:32.692
I see that.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.258
Look, I don't know why

11:34.432 --> 11:36.260
Cyrano's here,
but he should probably leave

11:36.434 --> 11:37.740
because we have our own
problems.

11:37.914 --> 11:38.959
DRAKE:
But my dear, Roxanne,

11:39.133 --> 11:41.962
feels in my soul here.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.485
You know, then again

11:43.659 --> 11:44.442
I don't have a date
for Valentine's Day

11:44.616 --> 11:45.748
and he is kind of hot.

11:45.922 --> 11:46.836
He's hot until
you figure out

11:47.010 --> 11:48.446
how many people he's killed.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.927
Well, hey, wait a minute,
I never killed anyone.

11:51.101 --> 11:53.060
Except demons.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.409
Killed plenty of them.

11:54.583 --> 11:55.932
Join the club.
It sucks, doesn't it?

11:56.106 --> 11:57.586
PAIGE:
You're telling me in

11:57.760 --> 11:58.892
your whole demonic career,

11:59.066 --> 12:00.850
you have not killed one
Innocent?

12:01.024 --> 12:02.722
That's because since
the day I was hatched,

12:02.896 --> 12:04.549
I've been reading books,

12:04.724 --> 12:05.942
and they taught me
about feelings,

12:06.116 --> 12:09.163
human feelings--
love, sadness, death.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.818
Since then, I could never harm
an Innocent.

12:11.992 --> 12:13.820
I always found a way around
doing that.

12:15.256 --> 12:16.474
What do you think?

12:16.648 --> 12:18.041
I kind of believe him, you?

12:18.215 --> 12:19.042
I don't know.

12:19.216 --> 12:20.957
I'm gonna ask Piper.

12:21.131 --> 12:23.046
Oh come on, Paige, tell her
I'm the right man for the job.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.440
Job? What job?

12:25.614 --> 12:28.530
Fill her in. I'll be back.

12:29.444 --> 12:30.837
So you um... you like

12:31.011 --> 12:32.273
Gene Kelly movies?

12:32.447 --> 12:34.449
Love 'em. Why?

12:38.279 --> 12:40.455
Thanks for coming.Of course.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.674
After all that's happened,
it's the least we could do.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.416
Oh, please,
don't apologize.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.810
If anything, we've been far
too lenient with him.

12:47.984 --> 12:50.813
Lenient?
You tried to kill me.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.249
You left us no choice.

12:52.423 --> 12:53.729
Funny, I feel the same way.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.600
Gentlemen,
neither side

12:55.775 --> 12:57.037
is without blame.

12:57.211 --> 12:58.560
Perhaps we could put
the past behind us.

12:58.734 --> 12:59.996
And we will...

13:01.258 --> 13:04.218
...once he's done the
penance for his betrayal.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.263
That's why I brought you here.

13:06.437 --> 13:07.743
I should be able
to defend myself

13:07.917 --> 13:09.136
before you issue judgment on me.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.833
Oh, really?

13:11.007 --> 13:12.139
And what would you say?

13:12.313 --> 13:14.097
That what I did
was for my family.

13:14.271 --> 13:15.751
I was trying to create

13:15.925 --> 13:17.144
a better world for them,
for all of us.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.667
Too bad you failed.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.234
SANDRA:
Perhaps it
would be best

13:20.408 --> 13:23.759
if Leo and I spoke alone,
if you don't mind.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.241
It hasn't been easy

13:27.415 --> 13:29.156
arguing on your behalf.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.592
Thanks for trying.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.246
One word
of advice, Leo.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.291
Stay out of magical affairs.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.816
Or you just might make things
even worse for yourself.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.649
Wow, let me get this straight.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.042
You do musical theater as well?

13:46.216 --> 13:48.392
Oh, I'm full of surprises.

13:50.742 --> 13:51.743
What's this?

13:51.918 --> 13:53.310
Another surprise.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.573
[romantic music playing ]

14:16.638 --> 14:18.858
Happy Valentine's Day.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.555
And to you.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.689
Get your paws
off of her!

14:24.864 --> 14:25.734
So much for romance.

14:25.908 --> 14:26.996
PHOEBE:
Piper...

14:27.170 --> 14:29.912
[laughing]:
we were just having fun.

14:30.086 --> 14:30.957
You know... fun.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.741
PIPER:
With a demon?

14:32.915 --> 14:34.961
Phoebe, how many times have
I told you not to play dress up

14:35.135 --> 14:36.266
with the demons.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.615
I'm sure it's harmless.

14:37.789 --> 14:38.486
DRAKE:
Hey, incidentally, Piper,

14:38.660 --> 14:40.009
I am an ex-demon.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.489
Look, buddy, we're not gonna
let a demon

14:41.663 --> 14:43.317
or an ex-demon teach

14:43.491 --> 14:45.145
at Magic School.
It's ridiculous.

14:45.319 --> 14:46.581
Maybe you're right.

14:46.755 --> 14:47.843
Drake, I'm really sorry.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.323
It's just not

14:49.497 --> 14:51.934
a real feasible thing
for you to do.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.457
It could cause
too many problems.

14:53.631 --> 14:56.069
Oh, no, you're making
a terrible mistake.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.158
As an ex-demon, I can get
through to these kids.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.508
I can keep them from going
down the path of evil.

15:00.682 --> 15:01.988
Phoebe,

15:02.162 --> 15:03.554
talk to them,
make them see reason.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.426
I can't.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.558
Look, I appreciate what
you're trying to do.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.038
But it just...

15:09.212 --> 15:10.561
it's not really practical.

15:10.735 --> 15:11.823
I'm sorry.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.738
Oh, this is all wrong.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.566
The problem here isn't me,
it's you three.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.133
You've been shaken
to the core

15:17.307 --> 15:18.526
by what's happened
with the Avatars.

15:18.700 --> 15:19.744
You, you just lost faith

15:19.919 --> 15:21.398
in yourself.

15:21.572 --> 15:22.399
And you, you've been
disheartened by the fight.

15:22.573 --> 15:23.835
And you, sweetheart,

15:24.010 --> 15:25.272
you are just plain mean.

15:25.446 --> 15:27.448
[laughing]

15:27.622 --> 15:29.406
Watch it.
[snickers]

15:29.580 --> 15:30.494
You're mean because

15:30.668 --> 15:32.235
you closed down your heart.

15:32.409 --> 15:33.933
You're petrified it's gonna get
broken again,

15:34.107 --> 15:35.369
aren't you?

15:35.543 --> 15:36.979
You know, there's only
one man I know

15:37.153 --> 15:38.894
who can solve all
of these problems.

15:46.858 --> 15:47.990
Oh, come on, Robin Hood!

15:49.383 --> 15:51.080
You, I'm gonna hire you
just so I can fire you.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.082
Do we look merry to you?

15:53.256 --> 15:54.431
Well, perhaps you
should see

15:54.605 --> 15:56.259
the world as Robin Hood
would have.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.652
He believed in himself.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.219
He also loved the thrill
of the fight.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.698
And despite the
threat of imminent death,

16:00.872 --> 16:03.397
he found love with
his dear Maid Marian.

16:03.571 --> 16:04.615
Oh...

16:04.789 --> 16:06.574
that's very sweet.

16:06.748 --> 16:07.792
Isn't that...?

16:09.272 --> 16:11.448
You should probably
change us back.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.711
Very well.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.370
PIPER:
Kitchen now.

16:20.544 --> 16:21.850
Let's go.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.680
You just give me one second.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.205
I thought they'd
never leave.

16:32.687 --> 16:34.210
Vanquish him, are you sure?

16:34.384 --> 16:36.430
Well, if he doesn't leave,
we don't really have a choice.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.127
But his heart is
in the right place.

16:38.301 --> 16:39.650
Now, let's
see those

16:39.824 --> 16:42.044
powers, demon.

16:43.393 --> 16:46.831
On the other hand, he still
has his demonic powers.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.529
Hi, waffle much?

16:48.703 --> 16:50.096
[loud crash]

16:50.270 --> 16:53.316
Darkness within cannot
be undone.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.492
Embrace your true self.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.712
Ah, here we go again!

17:01.237 --> 17:02.934
Damn it!

17:03.544 --> 17:04.588
Drake...

17:04.762 --> 17:06.721
are you okay?

17:06.895 --> 17:08.462
[with British accent]:
Drake? Who's Drake?

17:08.636 --> 17:10.029
I'm Robin...

17:11.813 --> 17:12.683
...of Locksley.

17:12.857 --> 17:15.251
Of course you are.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.301
Stand and deliver!

17:23.433 --> 17:24.478
Excellent.

17:24.652 --> 17:27.481
John will be no match for me.

17:27.655 --> 17:28.917
Robin, you missed.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.440
And if you put a hole

17:30.614 --> 17:32.312
in my wall, you'll have me
to answer to,

17:32.486 --> 17:33.617
not some prince.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.402
My apologies, my good woman,

17:35.576 --> 17:37.621
but my aim must be true if I am
to right John's wrongs.

17:37.795 --> 17:38.622
Hmm...

17:38.796 --> 17:40.537
Right.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.322
Just be careful.

17:44.976 --> 17:47.501
Uh, please tell me you found
a way to fix Robin in there.

17:47.675 --> 17:48.980
Not yet. Can't you
just freeze him?

17:49.155 --> 17:50.808
Nope, not freezing.

17:50.982 --> 17:53.289
I'm sorry, you guys, another big
mistake bringing him here.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.422
PHOEBE:
No, it's just our lives.I can fix that!

17:55.596 --> 17:57.293
Anything that can go wrong
will go wrong.

17:57.467 --> 17:58.642
PAIGE:
Yeah, but I
don't understand

17:58.816 --> 18:00.470
why it went wrong.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.168
Why did the Sorcerer want to
turn Drake into Robin Hood

18:02.342 --> 18:03.256
of all things?

18:03.430 --> 18:04.387
I don't think he meant to.

18:04.561 --> 18:05.867
I think he meant

18:06.041 --> 18:07.216
to bring out Drake's inner demon

18:07.390 --> 18:09.044
so he could use his powers.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.612
But then I blasted him mid-spell
so instead,

18:11.786 --> 18:13.092
we got his inner Robin Hood.

18:13.266 --> 18:14.310
Royal hound!

18:14.484 --> 18:16.051
Sorry, my fault!

18:16.225 --> 18:17.792
Well, another mistake
for the Charmed Ones.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.924
It's wasn't a mistake,
it was an accident.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.665
Either way, we messed up.

18:21.839 --> 18:23.754
PHOEBE:
Okay... I found a
vanquishing potion

18:23.928 --> 18:27.889
for the Sorcerer, but of course,
there's no way to find him.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.673
Well, how is finding
the Sorcerer

18:29.847 --> 18:31.371
even gonna fix Drake anyway?

18:31.545 --> 18:33.851
PIPER:
Actually I think it will
because if we vanquish

18:34.025 --> 18:36.115
the Sorcerer, then it should
reverse his magic.

18:36.289 --> 18:37.594
Saxon dog!

18:38.987 --> 18:39.901
PAIGE:
Okay, well, I'll go

18:40.075 --> 18:41.120
to the Magic School,

18:41.294 --> 18:43.078
and I'll ask Miss Donovan

18:43.252 --> 18:45.124
to look through things
and see if she can find

18:45.298 --> 18:46.908
something that helps us
find the Sorcerer.

18:47.082 --> 18:47.996
Or you could just

18:48.170 --> 18:49.519
do it yourself.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.653
Yeah, well, I don't know
the archives that well.

18:52.827 --> 18:54.785
And knowing me,
I'd probably mess up.

18:55.873 --> 18:58.224
What are we gonna do with her?

18:58.398 --> 18:59.790
We'll fix her later.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.792
Right now, we need
to deal with him.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.664
[loud crash]

19:05.361 --> 19:07.755
What is he doing
with my phone bill?

19:08.886 --> 19:11.846
Marian, these taxes
are outrageous.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.543
Prince John has gone too far.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.589
Okay, I'm not Marian,
I'm Phoebe, remember?

19:15.763 --> 19:17.330
And give me that!

19:17.504 --> 19:19.027
PIPER:
Prince John has been
dead for centuries.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.247
He's not taxing anyone anymore.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.292
Yeah, the phone
company is owned by a
different John and he's...

19:23.466 --> 19:25.251
well, a really swell guy.

19:25.425 --> 19:27.427
Nonsense. The evidence of his
misdeeds is right there

19:27.601 --> 19:28.689
on the parchment.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.256
You left that out?Who knew?

19:30.430 --> 19:31.648
I think it's high time
I paid John a visit!

19:31.822 --> 19:33.824
My steed!

19:35.043 --> 19:37.350
Horse power.

19:39.221 --> 19:41.267
What kind of Robin Hood
rides a motorcycle?

19:41.441 --> 19:43.617
Forget that, what
are we gonna do?

19:43.791 --> 19:45.271
We can't just let him
go out there,

19:45.445 --> 19:46.272
especially not with
Sheridan back.

19:46.446 --> 19:47.577
Sheridan's back?

19:47.751 --> 19:48.796
Did I forget to
mention that?

19:48.970 --> 19:50.145
Go with him.
What?

19:50.319 --> 19:51.929
You're the Marian person.
Go with him.

19:52.103 --> 19:53.670
Robin...

19:53.844 --> 19:57.718
Wait!
Here we go...

19:57.892 --> 19:59.415
Oh, okay.

19:59.589 --> 20:01.200
Helmets, please, people.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.421
Hold on, milady.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.481
[motorcycle approaching]

20:30.751 --> 20:32.318
Okay, well, no
Prince John here.

20:32.492 --> 20:33.710
We should probably
go home, huh?

20:33.884 --> 20:35.234
And give up without a fight?

20:35.408 --> 20:37.061
I think not.

20:38.759 --> 20:39.977
Those riches belong

20:40.151 --> 20:41.414
to the people
of Sherwood Forest.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.285
We must see that
they're returned.

20:43.459 --> 20:44.939
I know, but we can't
just steal from the rich

20:45.113 --> 20:46.941
and give to the poor.
There's laws against that.

20:47.115 --> 20:49.117
Marian, have you forgotten
what it is to do good?

20:52.207 --> 20:53.948
Next in line.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.602
Hey, that guy's cutting.

20:55.776 --> 20:58.605
Hey, hey... Pocahontas,
there's a line.

20:58.779 --> 20:59.997
Little John.

21:00.171 --> 21:01.608
You came to join our
merry band. Excellent.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.392
Who you calling
"little"?

21:03.566 --> 21:05.481
Must we settle this
with a quarter staff?Excuse me?

21:05.655 --> 21:07.266
Gentlemen.You want to fight me?
Is that it?

21:07.440 --> 21:09.180
No, no, no, no, no.
No, Robin...

21:09.355 --> 21:11.182
Excuse me.You've put on a bit of
girth since I last saw you.

21:11.357 --> 21:13.272
I'm the office manager here.
Is there a problem?

21:13.446 --> 21:15.404
This nut job's trying
to butt in line.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.406
He just doesn't
know any better.

21:17.580 --> 21:18.842
You will tell me
where Prince John is.

21:19.016 --> 21:20.844
Who?

21:21.018 --> 21:23.282
Prince John.Okay, look, we don't want
to kill the peasants.

21:23.456 --> 21:26.023
That's not what we do.Oh, he is no peasant.

21:26.197 --> 21:27.982
He's an accomplice to
the Prince's thievery.What?!

21:28.156 --> 21:29.244
I didn't steal anything.

21:29.418 --> 21:30.854
The hell you didn't.

21:31.028 --> 21:32.639
I read the paper,
I know you've been
screwing us.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.728
Thanks to you, I can't afford

21:34.902 --> 21:36.991
to take my wife out
for Valentine's Day.Oh, that's nothing.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.472
They cut off my phone
service for no reason,

21:39.646 --> 21:41.125
and now they want to charge me
to reconnect it.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.127
What about their
lousy technicians?

21:43.302 --> 21:44.955
I wasted a day of work
waiting on them.

21:45.129 --> 21:47.131
See, you're making all
our lives miserable.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.829
Kick his ass, Robin.

21:49.003 --> 21:50.483
PHOEBE:
No... just tell
him where

21:50.657 --> 21:52.311
John Normand is,
that's all he wants to know.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.095
Corporate headquarters,
financial district.

21:54.269 --> 21:55.923
Great, we'll find it.
Come on!

21:56.097 --> 21:57.838
MANAGER:
Just don't tell him I sent you.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.101
Good people of Sherwood,

22:00.275 --> 22:03.234
the Prince has abused his
power for far too long.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.062
He lives in riches
while you live in squalor.

22:05.236 --> 22:06.194
Yeah!

22:06.368 --> 22:07.413
It is high time we take back

22:07.587 --> 22:08.631
that which was
stolen from you.

22:08.805 --> 22:09.719
Damn right!

22:09.893 --> 22:11.068
All those who wish

22:11.242 --> 22:13.027
to join my fight--
you follow me!

22:13.201 --> 22:14.420
[crowd cheering]

22:16.987 --> 22:19.338
[crowd gasping]

22:19.512 --> 22:20.600
Stand down if you know

22:20.774 --> 22:22.210
what's good for you.

22:24.604 --> 22:27.041
Hey! What are
you doing?

22:27.215 --> 22:28.956
Marian, you're just in time.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.697
To the end
of Prince John's tyranny!

22:32.089 --> 22:33.569
You can't do this!

22:33.743 --> 22:34.875
Look what the Prince
has done to these people.

22:35.049 --> 22:36.833
How can you turn
a blind eye to that?

22:37.007 --> 22:39.706
Or has your heart
really grown that cold?

22:41.751 --> 22:42.578
Fill your hearts!

22:42.752 --> 22:44.188
And fill your bellies!

22:44.363 --> 22:45.886
The police are coming.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.409
We gotta go. Let's go.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.280
[sirens approaching]

22:49.455 --> 22:50.238
Excuse me.

22:55.896 --> 22:58.855
[sirens draw closer]

23:00.117 --> 23:02.468
Oh... Come on.

23:02.642 --> 23:06.950
Oh.... Oh, please.
please.
So.

23:08.604 --> 23:09.736
You can astral-project?

23:09.910 --> 23:14.131
That could come in
very handy... later.

23:17.134 --> 23:18.745
Morning, sunshine.

23:19.963 --> 23:21.008
What do you want with me?

23:21.182 --> 23:22.183
Well, I'm afraid

23:22.357 --> 23:23.227
I couldn't
bring the demon out

23:23.402 --> 23:25.055
of Drake as I'd planned.

23:25.229 --> 23:26.883
I was interrupted
by the Charmed Ones.

23:27.057 --> 23:28.494
Then they'll probably
come for you.

23:28.668 --> 23:30.713
Which is why I'll need you
to serve as a distraction

23:30.887 --> 23:32.715
when the time is right.
Oh, why

23:32.889 --> 23:34.064
did I ever come down here?

23:34.238 --> 23:35.544
I should have stayed
in the library!

23:35.718 --> 23:38.025
The library?

23:38.199 --> 23:40.810
Well, then,
you are indeed a prize.

23:40.984 --> 23:42.159
Why? What do you mean?

23:42.333 --> 23:43.291
The witches'
interference

23:43.465 --> 23:44.771
made my spell go awry.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.337
Drake is unstable now,

23:46.512 --> 23:50.777
and I needed to use this
to my advantage, so...

23:50.951 --> 23:53.083
tell me:

23:53.257 --> 23:56.609
What do you know
about Robin Hood?

23:59.176 --> 24:01.875
No, Phoebe, you can't take
him to John Normand's office.

24:02.049 --> 24:04.181
[bubbling]That is a very bad idea.

24:04.355 --> 24:05.966
You have to bring
him back here.

24:06.140 --> 24:09.404
[shouting]:
I said you have
to bring him back here!

24:09.578 --> 24:12.276
Phoebe? Phoebe!

24:13.277 --> 24:14.453
Damn it![phone beeps]

24:14.627 --> 24:18.892
Do I really need
this today? Or... ever?

24:19.066 --> 24:20.807
Relax. You can handle it.

24:20.981 --> 24:23.287
This coming from the man
who refuses to help.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.028
Well, I told you, I'm afraid

24:25.202 --> 24:26.552
that I'm gonna
piss off the Elders

24:26.726 --> 24:28.249
and they can recycle me, Piper.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.077
You don't want that, do you?

24:30.251 --> 24:32.862
No, of course not, but it's
just-- we were this close

24:33.036 --> 24:35.082
to a life without Elders,
without demons,

24:35.256 --> 24:38.302
without freaking Robin Hood
running through the streets

24:38.477 --> 24:39.782
threatening to expose us!

24:39.956 --> 24:41.654
I know, but this is the life

24:41.828 --> 24:44.657
that we have now and we have to
make the best out of that, okay?

24:44.831 --> 24:46.876
So... relax,
you can handle that,

24:47.050 --> 24:48.051
just like you've
done before.

24:48.225 --> 24:51.315
Thank you,
and don't remind me.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.101
Have you guys seen the news?

24:54.275 --> 24:56.582
No. Weren't you
at Magic School?

24:56.756 --> 24:58.279
Yeah, we have satellite.

25:01.238 --> 25:03.066
TV REPORTER:
He apparently threw
the stolen cash

25:03.240 --> 25:05.808
into the crowd,
inciting a near riot.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.723
Police have launched
a search for the man

25:07.897 --> 25:11.292
who bystanders described
as a modern-day Robin Hood.

25:11.466 --> 25:14.121
Mm. Still think
I can handle this one?

25:14.295 --> 25:16.036
Just like the
good old days.

25:16.210 --> 25:17.298
Bite your tongue.

25:17.472 --> 25:18.865
Okay, you
know what?
I should go

25:19.039 --> 25:20.170
warn Darryl, because
the cops have no idea

25:20.344 --> 25:21.345
what they're up against.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.564
No, no, no.
Wait. I need you

25:22.738 --> 25:23.913
to write a vanquishing spell.

25:24.087 --> 25:25.393
Why? You have the potion.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.743
Not for the Sorcerer. For Drake.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.266
For Drake? Really?

25:29.440 --> 25:31.617
We need to be able to stop him,

25:31.791 --> 25:33.357
and this may be the only way.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.489
Leo, can you warn Darryl?

25:34.663 --> 25:36.360
Uh, what about the Elders?

25:36.535 --> 25:38.362
Oh, for God's sakes,
I don't think they're gonna

25:38.537 --> 25:40.147
strike you down
for making a phone call.

25:40.321 --> 25:41.496
Right.

25:42.758 --> 25:45.108
You know what, I found
a spell at Magic School,

25:45.282 --> 25:47.328
and it should be able
to summon the Sorcerer.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.112
That way we don't have
to vanquish Drake.

25:49.286 --> 25:51.201
You mean Miss Donovan
found it?

25:51.375 --> 25:54.117
No. I found it.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.293
Come to think of it,
I haven't actually

25:56.467 --> 25:58.948
seen Miss Donovan
in a little while.

25:59.122 --> 26:00.733
Look, anyway, the point is...

26:00.907 --> 26:03.387
with my spell,
we can summon the Sorcerer.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.346
With your potion,
we can vanquish him,

26:05.520 --> 26:07.783
and that kind of fixes
the whole Drake thing, yeah?

26:07.957 --> 26:10.699
Maybe, but if that doesn't
work, we need a plan B.

26:10.873 --> 26:12.266
We've got to
stop Drake somehow.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.311
Well, I guess it can't hurt.

26:14.485 --> 26:15.574
Exactly.

26:15.748 --> 26:17.010
The last thing we need

26:17.184 --> 26:19.273
is another news report
like that one.

26:20.927 --> 26:22.363
He's a what?

26:22.537 --> 26:23.843
LEO:
An ex-demon.

26:24.017 --> 26:25.453
But he still
has powers, so be careful.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.542
You don't want the cops
to provoke him too much,

26:27.716 --> 26:28.935
He could take out
half the force.

26:29.109 --> 26:30.414
If Sheridan finds out,
that could be

26:30.589 --> 26:31.633
a trigger, man! A trigger.

26:31.807 --> 26:32.808
I'm sorry?

26:32.982 --> 26:34.157
For her memory.
If she remembers

26:34.331 --> 26:35.637
who was after them,

26:35.811 --> 26:37.117
then she'll be
all over usagain.

26:37.291 --> 26:38.771
Oh, then you can't
let her find out.

26:38.945 --> 26:40.729
Thanks for the tip, Leo.

26:45.212 --> 26:46.430
Good news,
Lieutenant.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.345
The captain wants us
to work together.

26:48.519 --> 26:52.349
So... where are
wegoing, partner?

26:52.523 --> 26:54.134
Uh...

26:55.918 --> 26:57.180
[tires screech]MAN:
Hey!

26:57.354 --> 26:58.704
What's the matter
with you, morons?!

26:58.878 --> 27:00.270
So, we're just gonna
talk to the guy, right?

27:00.444 --> 27:01.445
We're not actually
gonna kill him.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.230
No, of course not.

27:03.404 --> 27:06.363
As long as he promises
to give back every last penny.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.235
Wait. What do you
mean, every last penny?

27:08.409 --> 27:10.367
Look, I don't think
this is a good idea.

27:12.195 --> 27:14.197
[sighing]:
Marian, you've come so far.

27:14.371 --> 27:16.809
You must be strong enough
to finish the fight

27:16.983 --> 27:18.375
for those who cannot
fight for themselves.

27:20.029 --> 27:21.988
Let not all we've done
be for naught.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.729
[short siren blast]
Darryl.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.252
The Sheriff of Nottingham.

27:25.426 --> 27:26.688
It's about time
he arrived.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.124
Freeze!

27:29.256 --> 27:30.387
But... no...

27:32.651 --> 27:33.782
Sheridan.

27:33.956 --> 27:34.870
Marian!

27:35.044 --> 27:35.871
Marian!
Oh, my God.

27:36.045 --> 27:37.046
Are you okay?

27:38.874 --> 27:40.223
Yeah, I'm fine,

27:40.397 --> 27:41.572
but you're
under arrest.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.053
Where's the
other one?

27:44.227 --> 27:45.664
He got away.

27:48.884 --> 27:50.538
Prince John!

27:52.714 --> 27:54.455
We meet at last.

27:54.629 --> 27:55.761
What the hell is this?

27:55.935 --> 27:57.937
The end of your reign.

28:05.292 --> 28:07.729
You'll never make it out
of here, you know that.

28:07.903 --> 28:10.253
I mean, the cops will have
you inside of two minutes.

28:10.427 --> 28:11.907
You need not worry
about me, sire.

28:12.081 --> 28:14.649
What, what... What exactly
do you want from me?

28:14.823 --> 28:17.217
Did my ex-wife send you?

28:17.391 --> 28:18.522
I'm here to rob you.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.002
[distant siren wailing]Of course.

28:20.176 --> 28:22.004
Well, uh... in that case,

28:22.178 --> 28:24.877
we'd better get right to it,

28:25.051 --> 28:26.356
and you can be

28:26.530 --> 28:27.880
on your merry
way. Now, who

28:28.054 --> 28:29.403
should I make this out to?

28:29.577 --> 28:31.187
You will return all
that you have stolen

28:31.361 --> 28:32.406
to every last person

28:32.580 --> 28:33.842
in your domain.

28:34.016 --> 28:35.539
But I have millions
of customers.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.673
Then I suggest
that you get started.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.982
[helicopter hovering above]

28:45.288 --> 28:47.464
[garbled radio transmission,
siren wailing]

28:47.638 --> 28:49.249
Hold your position
and nobody makes a move

28:49.423 --> 28:50.554
[brakes screeching]until I say so.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.122
You should really
get that wound checked.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.689
No, thanks,
I've missed enough.

28:54.863 --> 28:56.082
Miss Halliwell
here was just

28:56.256 --> 28:57.692
telling me a very
interesting story.

28:57.866 --> 28:59.302
Wait.
You don't believe me?

28:59.476 --> 29:00.695
SHERIDAN:
Well, I think
it's a little

29:00.869 --> 29:02.131
far-fetched,
don't you think?

29:02.305 --> 29:05.047
You get kidnapped by Robin Hood,

29:05.221 --> 29:06.788
forced to go on a crime spree,

29:06.962 --> 29:09.095
only to be saved
in the end by us.

29:09.269 --> 29:10.226
[sirens approaching]That's a nice touch.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.314
Let her go, Sheridan.

29:11.488 --> 29:12.663
I told you, she's a friend.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.274
PHOEBE:
Hey, you know what?

29:14.448 --> 29:17.016
Sheridan, I'm a good person

29:17.190 --> 29:20.149
and I really think
that I can help you out

29:20.323 --> 29:22.543
in this situation
if you just let me.

29:22.717 --> 29:23.805
Do you really think you can?

29:23.979 --> 29:25.285
Yeah, I do.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.156
He and I have a
connection and he's

29:27.330 --> 29:29.158
a little messed up right now,
but I really think

29:29.332 --> 29:30.594
that I could
break through to him.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.814
But I gotta talk to him.

29:32.988 --> 29:34.424
That's completely
out of the question.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.775
It's dangerous
and it breaks procedure.

29:36.949 --> 29:38.298
PHOEBE:
You know what?
He's dangerous

29:38.472 --> 29:39.778
and you have no idea
what he's capable of.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.344
MAN:
Lieutenant, we're in position.

29:41.518 --> 29:42.389
We've got a clear shot.

29:42.563 --> 29:43.999
Hold your fire.

29:46.001 --> 29:46.828
She's going in.

29:47.002 --> 29:48.787
What?! Morris.

29:48.961 --> 29:50.484
That's an order, Inspector.

29:52.138 --> 29:53.487
Thank you, Darryl.

29:56.882 --> 29:59.885
You know, there's something
oddly familiar about this.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.843
You should get
that wound checked.

30:04.193 --> 30:05.455
Cover that jet!
Not yet!

30:05.629 --> 30:07.501
Let's go, let's go.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.811
"Sorcerer of darkness,
demon of fright,

30:12.985 --> 30:15.944
I call you now
into my sight."

30:17.859 --> 30:19.339
Maybe I can just
try it again.

30:19.513 --> 30:20.993
No, Paige, you've
tried three times.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.385
It's not working.

30:22.559 --> 30:24.997
He must be protecting
himself somehow.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.563
I could have copied
it down wrong.

30:26.737 --> 30:29.740
Paige, it's not your
first day as a witch.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.046
You know,
it's just,

30:31.220 --> 30:32.526
we're running
out of options.

30:32.700 --> 30:33.875
You saw the news.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.617
I think it's time
we go to Plan B.

30:36.791 --> 30:37.836
I think getting
rid of him

30:38.010 --> 30:39.272
would be a big mistake

30:39.446 --> 30:40.795
So would letting
an Innocent die.

30:40.969 --> 30:42.753
Look, if you're not
gonna trust yourself,

30:42.928 --> 30:45.452
at least trust me, because it's
certainly not myfirst day.

30:46.192 --> 30:47.236
Paige!

30:48.759 --> 30:49.760
Miss Donovan.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.501
Why are you astral-projecting?

30:51.675 --> 30:52.938
Please, I don't have time.

30:53.112 --> 30:54.678
The Sorcerer took me prisoner.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.419
What?
I swear,

30:56.593 --> 30:58.639
I was just trying
to check out Drake,

30:58.813 --> 31:00.249
and, you know, it turns out
he's, he's not so bad.

31:00.423 --> 31:01.772
But it was the Sorcerer

31:01.947 --> 31:02.861
that I should
have been worried about.

31:03.035 --> 31:04.166
It's okay.
We know all

31:04.340 --> 31:06.081
about it.
Don't panic because now

31:06.255 --> 31:07.604
that we know
where you are,

31:07.778 --> 31:09.650
we can scry for you
and get you out of there

31:09.824 --> 31:10.651
and just vanquish him.

31:10.825 --> 31:11.739
Oh, thank you.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.393
Now I gotta go.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.136
Looks like Drake

31:17.310 --> 31:18.354
just got a reprieve.

31:20.226 --> 31:21.792
...a reprieve.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.842
Well played, my dear.

31:28.016 --> 31:29.888
I wish I could have told them
what you were planning.

31:30.062 --> 31:32.368
If you had, you'd
be dead by now.

31:32.542 --> 31:35.241
At least now you'll
live a touch longer

31:35.415 --> 31:37.678
than the Charmed
Ones will.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.332
You see, thanks
to your message,

31:39.506 --> 31:40.768
they're now focused
on saving you.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.422
Too bad my lair
is protected

31:42.596 --> 31:45.904
against summoning
and scrying.

31:46.078 --> 31:47.949
It won't take them long
to figure it out.

31:48.123 --> 31:50.996
But, by then, I'll
have Drake's powers.

31:51.170 --> 31:52.736
How can you
be so sure?

31:52.911 --> 31:54.913
Well, you see, once a
demon, always a demon.

31:55.087 --> 31:57.002
I just need to
remind Drake of that

31:57.176 --> 32:00.483
by casting a spell
on Prince John.

32:02.790 --> 32:04.487
[helicopter hovering]

32:04.661 --> 32:06.968
Come on, you cannot expect me
to write all these checks.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.405
Oh! Robin! Don't shoot!

32:09.579 --> 32:10.624
It's me,

32:10.798 --> 32:12.147
your Marian.
Milady.

32:12.321 --> 32:13.540
How did you elude the sheriff?

32:13.714 --> 32:14.976
Oh, me and the sheriff
go way back.

32:15.150 --> 32:16.717
Now listen... Oop!

32:16.891 --> 32:19.938
Uh, don't you think it's
time we let the prince go?

32:20.112 --> 32:21.417
I'm sure he's learned
his lesson by now.

32:21.591 --> 32:22.723
Haven't you, John?

32:22.897 --> 32:24.551
Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh.

32:24.725 --> 32:25.726
Oh, I'm, I'm,

32:25.900 --> 32:27.597
I'm heartbroken here, man.

32:27.771 --> 32:29.991
I didn't realize what I was
doing to those poor people.

32:30.165 --> 32:32.211
I mean, thank you, Robin,
you have really

32:32.385 --> 32:34.561
shown me the error
of my ways.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.389
I swear, I am going to change.

32:36.563 --> 32:38.782
See, that's great.
That's great.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.436
I know you don't
want to hurt him.

32:40.610 --> 32:41.437
What about the money?

32:41.611 --> 32:42.961
He can't be trusted.

32:43.135 --> 32:45.050
Well, if you can't trust him,
then trust me.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.924
Look, today, you reminded me
what it's like to do good,

32:50.098 --> 32:51.882
to make a difference
and to help people.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.580
Now let me
help you.

32:53.754 --> 32:56.800
Come with me, before you
do something you'll regret.

33:00.456 --> 33:01.414
Sorry.

33:06.767 --> 33:11.250
Oh, I cannot believe that
you actually fell for that.

33:11.424 --> 33:12.991
But...

33:13.165 --> 33:14.688
I mean, really.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.385
You think I give a rat's ass
about some poor shmo

33:16.559 --> 33:19.214
who's too stupid to know
he's being suckered?

33:19.388 --> 33:21.869
There's no way in hell
I'm giving this money back.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.959
Oh, no,
the Sorcerer.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.656
All right, I don't think

33:26.830 --> 33:27.831
Darryl can hold off the cops
any longer.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.311
You're running out of time.

33:29.485 --> 33:31.009
What would you like me
to do about that?

33:31.183 --> 33:32.706
The crystal's not dropping.

33:32.880 --> 33:33.837
This isn't right, you guys.
We're being played.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.317
Come on, Paige,

33:35.491 --> 33:36.840
you're not gonna do
any of us any good

33:37.015 --> 33:37.841
by waffling now.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.800
I'm not waffling.

33:39.974 --> 33:43.064
Look, fine, I admit, okay,

33:43.238 --> 33:45.153
I've been out of it
since the

33:45.327 --> 33:46.459
whole thing
with the Avatars...

33:46.633 --> 33:48.548
and with Kyle.

33:48.722 --> 33:51.855
But I can't keep beating myself
up over the mistakes

33:52.030 --> 33:52.900
that we've made.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.033
I have to move on.

33:55.207 --> 33:56.295
I think we all do.

33:58.210 --> 34:00.038
I'm not sure it's that easy.

34:00.212 --> 34:01.996
Well, maybe it's not, but
I have to try, right?

34:02.170 --> 34:04.216
I mean, Drake said that I have

34:04.390 --> 34:05.782
to start trusting
my instincts again,

34:05.956 --> 34:07.915
otherwise I'm not gonna be able
to help him

34:08.089 --> 34:09.395
or Miss Donovan or anybody.

34:09.569 --> 34:10.918
So what are your instincts
telling you now?

34:11.092 --> 34:13.094
That Miss Donovan's
just a distraction,

34:13.268 --> 34:14.443
otherwise we would have found
her by now.

34:14.617 --> 34:16.793
Okay, say you're right.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.795
So you think the Sorcerer
is after Drake?

34:18.969 --> 34:20.580
He wants his powers, doesn't he?

34:20.754 --> 34:22.886
Drake's bound to use those
at some point or another.

34:25.367 --> 34:26.890
You will give the money back.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.240
Or what?

34:28.414 --> 34:29.371
You're gonna shoot me
with an arrow?

34:29.545 --> 34:31.417
Come on!

34:31.591 --> 34:33.897
I'm evil.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.377
You can do better
than that.

34:35.551 --> 34:37.118
Don't listen to him.
He's under a spell.

34:37.292 --> 34:41.731
You gotta punish me, destroy me
or I'll keep doing evil,

34:41.905 --> 34:43.646
and I don't give
a damn who gets hurt:

34:43.820 --> 34:46.127
single moms, old people, kids,
even your little maid here!

34:49.783 --> 34:51.785
She's not my maid!

34:55.919 --> 34:57.530
My God.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.969
Help me... please

35:04.014 --> 35:04.754
Okay, I gotcha.

35:04.928 --> 35:06.321
Oh...

35:09.890 --> 35:12.153
I gotcha!

35:14.373 --> 35:15.330
Hello.

35:16.940 --> 35:19.334
[Phoebe shrieks]

35:19.508 --> 35:22.381
Looks like your instincts
were right.

35:22.555 --> 35:23.991
REPORTER:
Moments ago, we believe that
billionaire John Normand

35:24.165 --> 35:25.775
is being hurled out
of that window by some...

35:25.949 --> 35:27.342
I just wish I should have
trusted em sooner.

35:27.516 --> 35:29.736
A deal is a deal.

35:36.917 --> 35:38.788
[gasps]

35:40.181 --> 35:41.182
[both shrieking]

35:41.356 --> 35:43.532
You... off to purgatory, my boy.

35:49.582 --> 35:50.583
Well,

35:50.757 --> 35:52.324
what are you
waiting for?

35:52.498 --> 35:55.196
Come and get me.

35:59.026 --> 36:02.464
This was the scene of chaos
just minutes ago

36:02.638 --> 36:04.814
when the man known as Robin Hood
detonated what appears

36:04.988 --> 36:06.903
to have been a homemade bomb.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.775
Fortunately, billionaire
John Normand escaped injury

36:08.949 --> 36:14.084
with the aid of local advice
columnist Phoebe Halliwell.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.651
Piper, we don't
have a choice,

36:15.825 --> 36:17.131
we have to go after
the Sorcerer.

36:17.305 --> 36:18.785
I realize that,
but he knows we're coming.

36:18.959 --> 36:19.960
He'll set a trap for us.

36:20.134 --> 36:21.135
What happened?

36:21.309 --> 36:22.484
The news said Drake
was missing.

36:22.658 --> 36:24.443
No, actually we lost him.

36:24.617 --> 36:26.009
But if we vanquish the Sorcerer,

36:26.184 --> 36:27.141
then we should be able
to reverse the magic

36:27.315 --> 36:28.186
and get Drake out of purgatory.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.318
Well, if we can use

36:30.492 --> 36:31.667
the vanquishing spell
I wrote

36:31.841 --> 36:33.321
to get rid of Drake,
then it should work

36:33.495 --> 36:35.454
on getting rid
of the Sorcerer.

36:35.628 --> 36:37.151
How can you be sure
that's gonna work?

36:37.325 --> 36:38.544
Because I trust my gut.

36:38.718 --> 36:39.675
Helped us find the Sorcerer,
right?

36:39.849 --> 36:40.546
And it was right about Drake.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.287
He is an Innocent.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.593
We have to save him, otherwise
everything he's done

36:44.767 --> 36:45.594
will have been for naught.

36:45.768 --> 36:47.117
"For naught"?

36:47.292 --> 36:48.771
The point is,
is we have to save Drake.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.425
I don't know.
I think Drake's

36:50.599 --> 36:51.774
caused enough trouble
for one day.

36:51.948 --> 36:53.428
I'll say.
We'll be lucky

36:53.602 --> 36:55.213
if he doesn't trigger Sheridan's
memory.

36:55.387 --> 36:57.606
Not to mention Prince John
and all the magic he saw.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.129
Okay, John won't remember

36:59.304 --> 37:01.175
a thing and we can worry
about Sheridan tomorrow.

37:01.349 --> 37:02.394
You worry tomorrow,

37:02.568 --> 37:03.830
I'll worry today.

37:05.397 --> 37:08.661
Found Miss Donovan.
Probably the Sorcerer, too.

37:08.835 --> 37:10.489
See? Wasn't that

37:10.663 --> 37:12.230
a little too easy?
I'm telling you
it's a trap.

37:12.404 --> 37:16.625
Maybe we should start thinking
more like Robin Hood.

37:16.799 --> 37:18.584
Excuse me?

37:22.022 --> 37:23.371
It won't be long now.

37:23.545 --> 37:25.112
I've lowered the cave's
protections,

37:25.286 --> 37:28.463
which means the Charmed Ones
are on their way.

37:28.637 --> 37:31.292
To vanquish you,
I'm sure.

37:31.466 --> 37:33.381
Oh, I'm sure they'll try,

37:33.555 --> 37:37.516
but we're on myturf now.

37:37.690 --> 37:40.910
And they'll be no match
for my new powers.

37:41.084 --> 37:44.610
I'm not so sure
about that.

37:44.784 --> 37:47.221
Well, well, well,
I'll give you this much.

37:47.395 --> 37:49.092
You're getting better
at that.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.051
You don't even need
to be asleep any more.

37:51.225 --> 37:53.314
I'm a fast learner.

37:53.488 --> 37:54.837
Me, too.

37:55.011 --> 37:56.578
Well, that's wonderful,

37:56.752 --> 37:58.493
but I don't think I have time
for this right now.

37:58.667 --> 38:00.190
You should make time.

38:00.365 --> 38:01.627
What the hell?

38:01.801 --> 38:04.934
'Cause you never know.

38:05.108 --> 38:08.024
It's true. You never know
when your time is up.

38:08.198 --> 38:10.157
The Charmed Ones!

38:10.331 --> 38:12.899
"Evil blast we cannot use...

38:13.073 --> 38:15.249
the Power of Three
now light the fuse."

38:15.423 --> 38:19.471
[screaming]

38:19.645 --> 38:21.168
Nicely done.

38:21.342 --> 38:22.952
What about Drake?

38:24.084 --> 38:25.825
Ow, that's hot!

38:25.999 --> 38:26.739
That's not gonna...

38:26.913 --> 38:28.915
Drake.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.743
You saved me?

38:30.917 --> 38:33.441
Of course,
what would you expect
from Maid Marian?

38:33.615 --> 38:34.573
And your merry men.

38:34.747 --> 38:35.530
Women.

38:35.704 --> 38:36.401
Excuse me?

38:36.575 --> 38:37.402
Ooh!

38:37.576 --> 38:38.316
Do you mind?

38:39.882 --> 38:41.667
That was interesting, huh?

38:41.841 --> 38:44.887
I guess. I just can't believe
we're back in the Underworld,

38:45.061 --> 38:46.802
back vanquishing
demons again.

38:46.976 --> 38:48.413
I don't know.

38:48.587 --> 38:51.372
After all, it is pretty
romantic, isn't it?

38:51.546 --> 38:52.591
You've got to be kidding.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.419
No, not at all.

38:54.593 --> 38:55.420
[grunts]

38:55.594 --> 38:56.769
Most of the world's greatest

38:56.943 --> 38:58.118
lovers were brought together

38:58.292 --> 39:00.642
during a time of epic conflict.

39:00.816 --> 39:02.078
Admittedly, most of them
were doomed,

39:02.252 --> 39:03.471
but they did find
the romance in it.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.430
So why can't you?

39:16.789 --> 39:20.314
Hey, thought you might
want to see this.

39:20.488 --> 39:21.968
"A hero."

39:22.142 --> 39:26.973
Now, aren't you glad
you didn't arrest her?

39:27.147 --> 39:28.148
Oh, I don't know.

39:28.322 --> 39:29.323
She didn't help us
get the guy.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.456
She didn't promise to.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.196
She promised to help...

39:33.371 --> 39:35.416
Yeah, but still, don't you think
it's just a little weird?

39:35.590 --> 39:37.636
I mean,
she goes inside,

39:37.810 --> 39:39.072
the perp gets away,

39:39.246 --> 39:42.118
but yet there's no trail
to follow, no leads.

39:42.292 --> 39:45.121
I mean it's almost
as though he just
disappeared.

39:45.295 --> 39:47.776
We'll get him.

39:49.212 --> 39:50.779
Good night, Sheridan.

39:59.832 --> 40:01.007
Oh, you look great

40:01.181 --> 40:03.662
in all your, uh...
teacher...ness.

40:03.836 --> 40:07.230
Oh, that little old thing?

40:07.405 --> 40:09.929
Okay, well, I've brought you
your class schedule

40:10.103 --> 40:11.278
and your student roster.

40:11.452 --> 40:14.020
And I, uh, have
assigned you a T.A.,

40:14.194 --> 40:15.456
Miss Donovan.

40:15.630 --> 40:18.416
She's not sore
for being passed over?

40:18.590 --> 40:20.505
I think she got all freaked out
by what happened.

40:20.679 --> 40:21.854
She did want to run back

40:22.028 --> 40:23.290
to that peace and quiet
of the library,

40:23.464 --> 40:25.031
But I've talked her
into helping you out

40:25.205 --> 40:26.293
in the class.

40:26.467 --> 40:27.816
Mm, I guess it's all
for the best.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.427
Someone's gotta take over.

40:29.601 --> 40:30.993
Why, are you planning
on being absent a lot?

40:31.167 --> 40:33.126
I mean, in case
it doesn't work out.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.520
We agreed it would
just be temporary at first.

40:35.694 --> 40:37.652
I mean, you may change
your mind in a couple of weeks.

40:37.826 --> 40:39.306
I may need to move on.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.439
I will not change my mind.
Trust me, anybody--

40:41.613 --> 40:43.049
anybody who can get through
the thick skulls

40:43.223 --> 40:44.877
of my lovely sisters and I,

40:45.051 --> 40:46.705
can definitely get through
to those kids.

40:46.879 --> 40:48.315
Even though I'm a little crazy?

40:48.489 --> 40:50.230
Because you are... a lot crazy.

40:50.404 --> 40:51.927
No, look,

40:52.101 --> 40:53.233
Magic School's protected.

40:53.407 --> 40:54.974
It's okay.
Give it your best shot.

40:56.802 --> 40:57.977
Hey...
Hey.

40:58.151 --> 41:00.458
I just came by to see
the new professor.

41:01.937 --> 41:04.070
All right, well,
uh, I promised
Piper and Leo

41:04.244 --> 41:05.724
that I'd baby sit
for them tonight.

41:05.898 --> 41:07.160
They're going out and
celebrating Valentine's Day.

41:07.334 --> 41:09.684
Mm-mm, finding a little
romance, are they?

41:09.858 --> 41:11.033
Thanks to you, yeah.

41:11.207 --> 41:12.905
Oh, I'm not done yet.

41:13.079 --> 41:16.125
Really?

41:16.299 --> 41:17.649
Okay, well, great

41:17.823 --> 41:19.651
awkward moment for me,
so I'll be going,

41:19.825 --> 41:22.044
and there's a night class
in five minutes, don't forget.

41:24.917 --> 41:27.963
So I thought you'd like to see
tomorrow's newspaper.

41:28.137 --> 41:30.270
Looks like Prince John

41:30.444 --> 41:31.924
is gonna give back
everything he stole.

41:32.098 --> 41:33.534
Guess he just needed

41:33.708 --> 41:35.754
to be reminded of his mortality.

41:35.928 --> 41:37.146
Works every time.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.105
Phoebe,

41:39.279 --> 41:41.847
there's something
I have to tell you.

41:42.021 --> 41:44.110
You know the deal
I made that made me human,

41:44.284 --> 41:47.287
that only lasts a year.

41:47.461 --> 41:50.420
Get at the end of it,
I gotta die.

41:50.595 --> 41:53.467
[laughs].

41:53.641 --> 41:55.730
What, are you kidding?

41:55.904 --> 41:57.210
No. Uh-uh.

41:57.384 --> 41:59.125
But listen,

41:59.299 --> 42:00.648
it was well worth the sacrifice.

42:00.822 --> 42:02.432
Now all I want to do
is I want to pass on

42:02.607 --> 42:04.260
what I've learned about
literature, about life...

42:04.434 --> 42:05.261
and about love.

42:05.435 --> 42:06.262
[sighs]

42:06.436 --> 42:08.221
How long do you have?

42:08.395 --> 42:10.440
Two weeks.

42:10.615 --> 42:15.620
Oh. I mean, I mean,
can we try to fix it?

42:15.794 --> 42:17.230
You can't.

42:17.404 --> 42:19.928
[bell rings]

42:20.102 --> 42:22.583
And you know what?
It's all good.

42:24.411 --> 42:25.760
See you.
