00:56.920 --> 01:00.071
Memorandum to Paramount Pictures,

01:00.200 --> 01:02.589
Hollywood, California,

01:02.720 --> 01:05.678
from Alexander Meyerheim. Subject
- my latest production.

01:05.800 --> 01:10.078
Gentlemen, while you sit back safely
in your air-conditioned offices,

01:10.200 --> 01:14.273
we here... in the trenches
are progressing brilliantly.

01:14.920 --> 01:17.798
As to your anxieties about
the script, dismiss them.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.990
I talked to the author in Paris.

01:20.120 --> 01:24.477
He assures me that he has at
this moment 138 glorious pages,

01:24.600 --> 01:29.355
which are even now being typed. I
plan to join him in Paris on Sunday.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.233
Period. Paragraph.

01:32.360 --> 01:36.069
Gentlemen, success is inevitable.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.668
An Alexander Meyerheim production

01:38.800 --> 01:41.678
of an original story and
screenplay by Richard Benson.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.678
- Richard Benson?
- You know him, my angel?

01:44.800 --> 01:47.268
Know him?

01:57.120 --> 02:00.112
I hate him! Richard Benson, phooey!

02:00.240 --> 02:03.949
It seems there are facets of him
you know even better than I do.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.469
I cannot imagine when he finds time to write.

02:06.600 --> 02:10.070
Unfortunately, he had time
to write a script for me.

02:10.199 --> 02:12.111
The last ten pages were found

02:12.240 --> 02:14.470
floating off Malibu, in a vodka bottle.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.475
Send the usual telegram to Benson.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.115
Richard assures me that for all
practical purposes he's on the wagon.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.956
It's open. Come in.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.873
- Yes?
- Mr Benson?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.070
You are the young lady
from the typing bureau?

05:27.200 --> 05:28.952
I am.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.674
If we are to have a happy
and harmonious relationship,

05:31.800 --> 05:34.394
I beg you, never answer a
question with a question.

05:34.520 --> 05:35.953
- Is that clear?
- Did I?

05:36.080 --> 05:38.878
There you go again, answering
a question with a question.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.468
My yes when you opened
the door was a question.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.079
Question mark implied, of course.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.350
You know the difference
between implied and inferred?

05:45.480 --> 05:46.799
Isn't that a question?

05:48.920 --> 05:50.353
Yes.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.277
Then you answered my
question with a question.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.392
To imply is to indicate without
saying openly or directly,

05:55.520 --> 05:58.796
to infer is to conclude from
something known or assumed.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.595
- My name is Gabrielle Simpson.
- Is that a bird?

06:02.720 --> 06:07.191
I was told the job would take several
days. I had nobody to leave him with.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.675
Well, this is it. The office there,

06:09.800 --> 06:12.792
I live up here, the terrace is out there.

06:12.920 --> 06:16.879
That grotesque object so prominent
on the horizon is the Eiffel Tower.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.470
I had it moved there to
remind me what town I'm in.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.831
If it offends you, I'll
have it taken away again.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.679
You live through here.
It's an adjoining room,

06:26.800 --> 06:29.678
which no doubt to your mind has
terribly sinister connotations.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.870
- Not at all...
- If so, dismiss them.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.673
I would have got you a room down the hall

06:34.800 --> 06:37.473
but the joint's filled up.
Bastille Day weekend, all that.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.068
It's quite alright. I once
worked for an American novelist

06:40.200 --> 06:42.668
who only wrote in the
bathtub. I'm used to anything.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.075
You can unpack. In the bathtub?

06:45.200 --> 06:50.069
Yes. I gave him a packet of bubble
bath and we got on swimmingly.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.679
I see.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.872
Does that imply that the
bird's name is Richelieu?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.673
It's inferred, I believe,
rather than implied.

06:58.520 --> 07:01.478
Swimmingly. Interesting figure of speech.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.237
You call the canary Richelieu
because you wanted a cardinal?

07:08.360 --> 07:10.430
That's very funny.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.677
No, it isn't. Just one
of the hazards of being

07:13.800 --> 07:16.997
a famous international wit,
which I am. Have to keep trying.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.271
I can't tell you how delighted I
am by this assignment, Mr Benson.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.472
And to have the opportunity to work
with a screenwriter of your stature.

07:23.600 --> 07:27.070
I'm interested in cinema myself.
I'm sure I can learn a great deal.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.155
Thank you.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.875
Last month I worked for Roger Roussin
the New Wave director. You know him?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.877
I'm more of an Old Wave man.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.468
The picture's terribly
interesting. Very avant-garde.

07:36.600 --> 07:40.673
About people who go to this party
and decide not to play Scrabble.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.475
It was called The Scrabble
Game Will Not Take Place.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.478
His next one's about a girl who
won't have a birthday party -

07:47.600 --> 07:48.874
Blow Out No Candles.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.276
Roger believes what's important
on screen is what doesn't happen.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.470
Does your film have a title yet?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.955
Of course.

07:57.080 --> 08:00.231
The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower.

08:00.360 --> 08:04.069
The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel
Tower. It sounds fascinating.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.633
The title is symbolic?

08:05.760 --> 08:08.479
She doesn't really steal
the Eiffel Tower. Does she?

08:10.800 --> 08:12.870
What's the story about?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.673
It's an action-suspense...

08:15.800 --> 08:18.678
.. romantic melodrama. With
lots of comedy, of course.

08:18.800 --> 08:22.679
And deep down underneath a
substrata of social comment.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.519
Oh. Well, if I could see
the pages you've written,

08:25.640 --> 08:28.074
I could estimate the size of the typing job.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.078
The pages, my dear girl, are right here.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.669
An Alexander Meyerheim production.

08:36.520 --> 08:39.080
The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.669
Original story and
screenplay by Richard Benson.

08:42.799 --> 08:45.792
Here, with a page or two of
interestingly photographed

08:45.920 --> 08:47.876
establishing shots,
possibly from a helicopter,

08:48.000 --> 08:51.276
- a boy and a girl meet.
- But, Mr Benson...

08:51.400 --> 08:54.278
Now, after some chitchat,

08:54.400 --> 08:57.392
getting-to-know-you stuff,
which I do so brilliantly,

08:57.520 --> 09:01.274
we feel an unconscious
attraction between the two.

09:01.400 --> 09:05.075
An indication to the audience of
the tremulous beginnings of love.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.111
And then, conflict!

09:07.240 --> 09:11.074
We can tell by the music how
deeply fraught with danger

09:11.200 --> 09:13.270
the whole situation is.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.995
And now,... our first switch.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.590
The audience gasps when they
realise they've been fooled.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.269
Things are not what they seem. Not at all.

09:24.400 --> 09:28.678
In fact, the whole situation
is completely reversed,

09:28.800 --> 09:32.679
involving the magnificently ingenious

09:32.800 --> 09:35.872
switch... on the switch.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.272
Amazed by the sudden turn of events,

09:41.400 --> 09:45.871
the boy and girl realise how
gravely they've misjudged each other.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.072
At that moment,

09:51.200 --> 09:53.998
the music turns ominous once more.

09:54.120 --> 09:59.274
They become aware of the danger
that they're in and the chase is on!

09:59.400 --> 10:01.356
Screaming tyres, rooftops,

10:01.480 --> 10:05.075
long shots of tiny figures racing
through the fear-gripped city.

10:05.200 --> 10:09.273
When suddenly in a deserted alley
we see, seated on a garbage can,

10:09.400 --> 10:11.470
licking its wet rain-bedraggled fur,

10:11.600 --> 10:13.670
close shot, the cat!

10:14.720 --> 10:18.474
Now, as we build step by step to the climax,

10:18.600 --> 10:20.079
the music soars.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.270
And there, totally oblivious

10:22.400 --> 10:25.472
of the torrential rain
pouring down upon them,

10:25.600 --> 10:29.673
the two fall happily and
tenderly into each other's arms.

10:29.800 --> 10:34.078
And as the audience drools
with sublimated sexual pleasure,

10:34.200 --> 10:37.875
the two enormous and highly
paid heads come together

10:38.000 --> 10:40.878
for that ultimate and inevitable moment.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.072
The final, earth-moving,

10:44.200 --> 10:47.272
studio-rent-paying,
theatre-filling,

10:47.400 --> 10:49.470
popcorn-selling...

10:52.120 --> 10:54.076
.. kiss.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.475
Fade out. The end.

10:59.920 --> 11:03.833
That's it. 138 pages. Why make it
longer? We'd only have to cut later.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.679
- Mr Benson...
- Yes?

11:08.320 --> 11:12.074
This screenplay, when does
it have to be finished?

11:13.520 --> 11:15.670
Well, let's see, today is Friday.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.679
My friend and, in this case, patron
and producer Mr Alexander Meyerheim

11:19.800 --> 11:22.758
arrives in Paris from
Cannes at ten o'clock on...

11:24.200 --> 11:28.796
.. Sunday morning. Which
happens to be Bastille Day.

11:28.920 --> 11:32.071
Perfect! 10:01 we hand
him the completed script,

11:32.200 --> 11:36.079
and then you and I celebrate. Drink
champagne, dance in the streets,

11:36.200 --> 11:38.156
whatever they do on July 14th.

11:38.280 --> 11:43.070
You're very kind but I have a date.
You haven't written anything at all?

11:44.840 --> 11:46.193
You have a date?

11:46.320 --> 11:50.359
You mean this entire movie
has to be done in two days?

11:51.520 --> 11:56.514
Miss Simpson, if you aren't up to
your part of the job, tell me now.

11:56.640 --> 12:00.076
- I can find someone else.
- No, I didn't mean that.

12:00.200 --> 12:03.272
It's just that it's, well,
rather unusual, isn't it?

12:03.400 --> 12:05.072
Not for me.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.714
I imagine you've given it
a great deal of thought.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.193
No, I haven't.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.832
So what have you been doing?

12:15.120 --> 12:17.918
What any red-blooded American screenwriter

12:18.040 --> 12:20.395
would or should have been doing

12:20.520 --> 12:24.479
for the first 19 and a fraction
weeks of his employment.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.272
Water-skiing in St Tropez,

12:26.400 --> 12:29.073
lying in the sun in Antibes, studying Greek.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.792
Greek?

12:30.920 --> 12:34.071
There was this starlet
representing the Greek film industry

12:34.200 --> 12:36.395
at the Cannes Festival.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.080
Then, of course, a few
weeks unlearning Greek,

12:39.200 --> 12:41.475
which involved a considerable amount of vodka

12:41.600 --> 12:43.875
and an unpremeditated trip
to Madrid for the bullfights,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.992
which fortunately, since I
can't bear the sight of blood,

12:47.120 --> 12:49.076
had long since gone on to Seville.

12:49.200 --> 12:53.079
Weeks 17 and 18 were spent
in the casino at Monte Carlo,

12:53.200 --> 12:56.317
in a somewhat ill-advised
attempt to win enough money

12:56.440 --> 12:59.591
to buy back my $5,000-a-week,
plus expenses, contract

12:59.720 --> 13:03.269
from my friend, employer and
patron, Mr Alexander Meyerheim,

13:03.400 --> 13:06.995
thus not having to write the
picture at all. Take a note.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.271
For the textbook I will someday
do on the art of screenwriting,

13:10.400 --> 13:14.473
never play 13, 31 and the corners thereof

13:14.600 --> 13:19.276
for any serious length of time for
any serious money. It doesn't work.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.073
And now I have to. Shall we begin?

13:24.520 --> 13:27.080
An Alexander Meyerheim production.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.875
Caps, quotes. The Girl
Who Stole the Eiffel Tower.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.070
You do like the title?

13:33.200 --> 13:36.078
Oh, yes, it certainly sounds intriguing.

13:36.200 --> 13:40.990
It intrigued Meyerheim, too. He
bought the title, script unseen.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.078
Original story and
screenplay by Richard Benson.

13:44.800 --> 13:48.475
Page one. Fade in.
Exterior. Paris, naturally.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.670
Let's see, night or day?

13:51.920 --> 13:54.070
Day.

13:54.200 --> 13:58.079
Begin... with a shot
of... of the Eiffel Tower.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.713
The camera zooms in. Standing
windswept and alone on a platform

14:02.840 --> 14:06.071
is a mysterious woman in
black. She glances at her watch.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.156
And we see...

14:14.520 --> 14:17.671
How the hell do I know?
Mysterious woman in black.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.677
Oh, how the mighty have fallen!

14:19.800 --> 14:24.316
Mustn't be obvious. Don't give the
whole story too early. OK. Fade in.

14:24.440 --> 14:28.149
Exterior, le Sacré Coeur. Day.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.876
No...

14:32.000 --> 14:34.275
Make that, erm,...

14:34.400 --> 14:36.356
.. the Grand Palais.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.268
We've got to give the audience

14:44.400 --> 14:47.870
the taste and smell of the real Paris.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.272
OK.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.356
Exterior. Christian Dior. The camera pans,

14:55.480 --> 15:00.679
and now we see a white Rolls-Royce
pull up and come to a stop.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.475
No, wait a minute, make that a white Bentley.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.477
It's chicer.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.831
A chauffeur in white livery
leaps out and opens the door.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.794
From inside emerges some
classically glamorous star

15:13.920 --> 15:16.480
like Marlene Dietrich.

15:17.920 --> 15:21.276
And now she...

15:21.400 --> 15:23.277
Dot, dot, dot.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.678
She sweeps majestically into the store and...

15:28.520 --> 15:32.559
That's all we see of her. Makes no
sense but Alex would have loved it.

15:32.680 --> 15:37.276
He could have stolen the Bentley and
afterwards charged it to the picture.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.673
- What d'you say your name was?
- Gabrielle Simpson.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.553
- How long have you lived in Paris?
- Two years.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.240
And you came here to write.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.999
Well, that, too, but mostly to...

15:50.120 --> 15:52.918
I don't know how to say it exactly. Live.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.792
Live?

15:54.920 --> 15:56.956
Would you mind...?

16:01.200 --> 16:03.668
You were saying you came here to live.

16:03.800 --> 16:08.669
Yes. For the first six months I made
a comprehensive study of depravity.

16:09.720 --> 16:10.675
No kidding?

16:10.800 --> 16:14.679
Seriously. Never got to bed
before eight in the morning.

16:14.800 --> 16:18.031
Who knows how many cups of
poisonous black coffee I consumed?

16:18.160 --> 16:22.278
I didn't drink then, so it was
hard to get totally into the spirit.

16:22.400 --> 16:26.075
Depravity can be terribly boring
if you don't smoke or drink.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.316
But a person must try to grow.

16:28.440 --> 16:32.592
And the guy you're dating on Bastille
Day, is he part of the process?

16:32.720 --> 16:35.632
No, he's just a friend.
A struggling young actor.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.990
An actor?!

16:38.120 --> 16:39.678
Ewww...

16:39.800 --> 16:42.268
A tragic relationship to begin with.

16:42.920 --> 16:47.675
I hope he's not a method actor who
scratches and mumbles and pauses,

16:47.800 --> 16:51.429
thereby destroying the impeccable
rhythm of the author's prose.

16:51.560 --> 16:54.711
No, he's a little intense but lots of fun.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.479
Uh-huh? Yeah, well...

16:58.600 --> 17:03.435
And you and this... actor, what
do you plan to do on Bastille Day?

17:03.560 --> 17:07.678
We'll spend the whole day together.
First, breakfast at a little café,

17:07.800 --> 17:10.678
then we'll dance from one
end of Paris to the other,

17:10.800 --> 17:14.679
opera at five, then the guards and
the singing of the Marseillaise,

17:14.800 --> 17:16.756
off to Montmartre for the fireworks,

17:16.880 --> 17:19.553
then supper and champagne
and, you know, live.

17:20.119 --> 17:22.873
- You really like it, don't you?
- What?

17:23.000 --> 17:23.954
Life.

17:24.079 --> 17:28.517
Every morning when I wake up
and see a whole new other day,

17:28.640 --> 17:30.437
I just go absolutely ape.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.278
I've got an idea.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.789
I got an idea! The first
good one in four months.

17:38.920 --> 17:42.674
No, I had an idea to give up drinking
- it didn't photograph.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.473
Now this could be good. Very good indeed.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.478
A simple story of a simple
Parisian working girl

17:48.600 --> 17:52.479
and how she spends July 14th. The
whole picture plays in one day.

17:52.600 --> 17:56.070
And I've got two days to write
it. Fade in. Exterior, Paris.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.749
As our story begins, it's
early Bastille Day morning.

18:00.960 --> 18:04.157
And all the trumpets of
Paris are sounding reveille.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.279
Over a shot of the Arch of Triumph,

18:12.400 --> 18:16.075
superimpose "An Alexander
Meyerheim production".

18:16.200 --> 18:20.113
Cut to the Eiffel Tower. The main title.

18:22.800 --> 18:26.156
The trumpets segue into
the inevitable title song.

18:27.120 --> 18:30.271
Maybe we can get Sinatra to sing it.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.078
There follows an interminable
list of other credits

18:45.200 --> 18:49.318
acknowledging the efforts of all
the quote little people unquote,

18:49.440 --> 18:52.477
whom I shall graciously
thank in my acceptance speech

18:52.600 --> 18:54.192
at the Academy Awards.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.276
As the cymbals crash,

18:56.400 --> 18:59.870
"Original Story and
Screenplay by Richard Benson".

19:02.080 --> 19:03.911
OK.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.871
Fade out.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.595
And fade in. A picturesque Parisian square,

19:09.720 --> 19:12.473
where the holiday
festivities are in progress.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.192
A simple Parisian working girl,

19:14.320 --> 19:16.470
who looks remarkably like you, Miss Simpson,

19:16.600 --> 19:18.875
emerges from her simple Parisian dwelling

19:19.000 --> 19:23.073
and makes her way through the
crowd and across the square.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.869
She seats herself at a table
at this little café she goes to.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.879
With breathless anticipation, she
awaits the arrival of her date.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.116
Some... actor.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.913
Now I suppose we'll have to describe him.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.280
I see him as curiously unattractive.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.392
Not at all. Philippe
happens to be very handsome.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.478
In fact, he looks rather
like, erm, Tony Curtis.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.478
I see him as one of those
mumbling scratching actors

19:53.600 --> 19:55.875
destined only for minor
roles and character parts.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.195
And his name is not Philippe. It's Maurice.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.276
Maurice!

20:05.120 --> 20:07.076
Like, er, bonjour, baby.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.997
- Bonjour, Maurice!
- Hey.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.874
Oh, I'm so excited. I didn't
sleep a wink. Do you like my dress?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.274
Yeah, very groovy.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.551
Would it be too wicked
if instead of breakfast

20:17.680 --> 20:20.478
we had a glass of champagne right here?

20:20.600 --> 20:22.670
Thanks.

20:25.320 --> 20:28.471
- Look, baby...
- Yes, Maurice?

20:28.600 --> 20:30.670
This Bastille Day gig?

20:31.520 --> 20:34.671
Like, erm, we're gonna have to cool it.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.677
But, Maurice, I don't understand.

20:36.800 --> 20:40.475
Well, see, baby, I'm going to
have to cut. See, last night,

20:40.600 --> 20:43.876
while I was making the
scene at le drug store,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.788
I was tearing an expresso
with a couple of local citizens

20:47.920 --> 20:52.072
when, erm, all of a sudden this New Wave
- looking stud comes in

20:52.200 --> 20:54.873
and says his name is Roger Roussin

20:55.000 --> 20:58.470
and, like, he's making a
film about Bastille Day.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.034
No Dancing in the Streets.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.038
No Dancing in the Streets?

21:04.160 --> 21:08.278
In Roger's flick it, like, erm,... rains.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.550
Anyway, he offers me the lead.

21:10.680 --> 21:13.513
Oh, Maurice, I'm, like, so happy for you.

21:13.640 --> 21:18.873
See, I have to split. We're gonna
be shooting all day. In the sewers.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.274
I see.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.512
Hey, baby, I got wheels, can I drop you?

21:23.640 --> 21:25.517
No thanks, I prefer to walk.

21:25.640 --> 21:27.471
Crazy.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.076
Erm, à tout à I'heure.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.314
With the almost lunatic narcissism

21:39.440 --> 21:42.000
peculiar to his curious calling,

21:42.120 --> 21:45.908
Maurice rather preciously
mounts his motor scooter.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.235
Our heroine is left grief-stricken,

21:48.360 --> 21:51.477
not realising how much
better off she really is.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.875
They were going to spend
the whole day together!

21:57.000 --> 21:59.309
My dear, you just witnessed the first switch.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.795
Maybe, but Maurice would
never behave that way.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.309
Besides, his name is not
Maurice, it's Philippe.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.273
So, having successfully disposed
of her date for Bastille Day,

22:08.400 --> 22:11.073
we move on to important matters. Conflict.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.553
Conflict?

22:12.680 --> 22:14.671
The other man.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.875
The third corner of the obligatory triangle.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.673
Didn't Roger whatshisname,
the No Scrabble director,

22:20.800 --> 22:23.075
teach you anything about writing movies?

22:25.120 --> 22:26.348
No...

22:27.520 --> 22:30.273
- For a moment, Gabby sits there...
- Gabby?

22:30.400 --> 22:32.675
We've got to call her something.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.678
For a moment, Gabby sits there.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.875
A lonely and pathetic figure.

22:39.600 --> 22:42.876
But unbeknownst to her, this
heart-breaking little scene

22:43.000 --> 22:44.877
has been witnessed by...

22:45.720 --> 22:47.676
.. dot, dot, dot,...

22:48.600 --> 22:50.670
.. a mysterious stranger.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.159
A mysterious stranger. How exciting.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.675
Miss Simpson, before you escape the confines

22:57.800 --> 22:59.870
of this unpretentious hotel room,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.275
it's my intention to show you

23:02.400 --> 23:05.472
just how exciting a
mysterious stranger can be.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.795
I suppose we'll have to describe him.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.399
Yes, I suppose so.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.988
He's American, of course.

23:12.120 --> 23:14.395
I can write him better that way.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.476
Now let's see, what else?

23:17.400 --> 23:20.870
I see him as rather tall, rather suntanned,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.673
rather handsome, athletic looking,

23:23.800 --> 23:29.079
with a rugged but...
curiously sensitive face.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.430
Poor sad creature. Little does she realise

23:55.560 --> 23:58.074
that in a moment she and the audience

23:58.200 --> 24:00.668
will have totally forgotten
that dull clod Maurice,

24:00.800 --> 24:03.268
or Philippe or whatever his name is.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.470
At this magic moment her
life has indeed begun.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.794
Tenderly he folds her into his arms,

24:10.920 --> 24:14.390
and moving with the nimble
grace of a Fred Astaire,

24:14.520 --> 24:17.080
he dances her off into the crowd.

24:26.320 --> 24:30.677
In exactly ten seconds I want
you to slap me as hard as you can.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.597
What?

24:32.720 --> 24:35.473
There is unfortunately no time to explain.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.676
And no reason to trust me. But I trust you.

24:39.800 --> 24:43.873
There's something about your
big magic eyes, and I am...

24:44.000 --> 24:46.468
Well, the name doesn't matter.

24:47.120 --> 24:52.672
Just think of me as...
1331, American Intelligence.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.278
This must be some kind of a joke.

24:56.800 --> 24:59.473
If you will look slightly to your left...

24:59.600 --> 25:01.670
Without moving your head, please.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.075
You will see in that window...

25:36.400 --> 25:39.676
In the bouquet I handed
you is a piece of microfilm.

25:39.800 --> 25:44.669
I can't tell you what it is, but
should it fall into the wrong hands,

25:44.800 --> 25:48.110
it may mean the end of
civilisation as we know it.

26:05.320 --> 26:09.279
The time has come for you to
slap me as hard as you can.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.390
Stop!

26:38.520 --> 26:40.590
Spies in trench coats?

26:40.720 --> 26:44.474
I'm afraid I got carried
away. We'll have to go back.

26:55.920 --> 26:59.879
OK. That brings us back to where we were.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.072
We're alright through getting
rid of her date for Bastille Day.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.078
The boy and the girl meet and...

27:07.800 --> 27:11.873
.. and they dance, and they dance...

27:12.400 --> 27:14.197
And they dance, and they dance...

27:15.000 --> 27:17.195
Mr Benson?

27:17.320 --> 27:21.029
Now then. The mysterious
stranger. Who is he...?

27:21.160 --> 27:22.878
There's someone at the door.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.276
What does he do? What suffering, what torment

27:26.400 --> 27:29.039
caused the sadness that
lurks behind his eyes?

27:29.160 --> 27:30.673
And why, while we're asking questions,

27:30.800 --> 27:33.678
didn't I listen to my father
and learn a useful trade?

27:33.800 --> 27:35.472
Merci.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.477
It's a telegram.

27:52.520 --> 27:55.080
Well, aren't you going to open it?

27:55.200 --> 27:59.079
No, I'm not going to open
it. The reason I won't open it

27:59.200 --> 28:01.270
is I'm fully aware what it says.

28:01.400 --> 28:06.269
The reason for that is because in
the last 19 and a fraction weeks

28:06.400 --> 28:10.473
I have received 134 telegrams
from Mr Alexander Meyerheim,

28:10.600 --> 28:15.390
all saying exactly the same thing.
When will the script be finished?

28:15.520 --> 28:17.670
When will the script be finished?

28:17.800 --> 28:21.076
How can I write with him
badgering me this way?

28:21.200 --> 28:24.078
Day and night, wires,
messages, telephone calls.

28:24.200 --> 28:28.398
How was it today? Did you work
well? When will it be finished?

28:28.520 --> 28:31.592
Talk about men in trench coats!
He spies on me constantly.

28:31.720 --> 28:34.996
His people are everywhere. For
all I know, you might be one.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.394
Mr Benson!

28:37.600 --> 28:40.751
I'm sorry. Some days I just feel
like whatshisname in Les Misérables.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.599
- Jean Valjean.
- I guess so.

28:43.720 --> 28:47.269
Only last night... Last night
I swore to him on the telephone

28:47.400 --> 28:50.278
that I had 138 pages in front of me.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.073
I said, "Alex, any man who takes your money

28:53.200 --> 28:57.478
and tells you he's got 138
pages in front of him and doesn't

28:57.600 --> 29:00.353
is nothing but a liar and a thief!"

29:01.320 --> 29:04.471
Sometimes I get the
feeling he doesn't trust me.

29:23.480 --> 29:27.075
I know who the mysterious stranger is.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.873
He's a liar and a thief.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.513
Sure. A latterday François Villon,

29:31.640 --> 29:34.200
who lives by his wits and what he steals.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.276
A jewel thief, maybe.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.789
Expert safe-cracker.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.275
There isn't a safe in the world

29:41.400 --> 29:44.790
he can't open with his
bare hands. I've got it!

29:44.920 --> 29:47.275
We have to start all over again

29:47.400 --> 29:50.710
but that's not too serious.
We've only got eight pages.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.479
Let's see. We're alright through
Alexander Meyerheim production,

29:53.600 --> 29:57.115
Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower,
story and screenplay, Richard Benson.

29:57.240 --> 30:02.872
We keep the Bastille Day jazz, only
this time we don't start on Gabby,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.230
we start on... Rick.

30:05.360 --> 30:08.875
Rick. That's a wonderful name
for the mysterious stranger.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.276
Don't editorialise. Just start typing.

30:12.920 --> 30:16.071
Exterior, day. A picturesque square.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.594
Amidst the throng of merrymakers,

30:19.720 --> 30:24.669
the camera picks up a rather
tall, rather suntanned American...

30:25.520 --> 30:29.672
We'd better change his wardrobe
for a liar-and-a-thief suit.

30:29.800 --> 30:32.030
You know, various shades of black.

30:32.160 --> 30:35.994
Moving with the grace of ajungle
cat, Rick approaches the table

30:36.120 --> 30:39.078
where Gabby is getting the
brush-off from her actor.

30:39.200 --> 30:43.273
His almost super-human intelligence
takes in the situation at once.

30:43.400 --> 30:47.598
He hesitates. If there's a
single chink in Rick's armour,

30:47.720 --> 30:49.676
it's a pretty face.

30:49.800 --> 30:53.270
He comes to a decision
and moves to another table,

30:53.400 --> 30:56.278
where two denizens of
the underworld await him.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.675
Call them first gangster and second gangster.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.677
Well, Rick?

31:02.400 --> 31:06.154
- Have you thought it over?
- I'm considering the proposition.

31:06.280 --> 31:11.877
It is a plan of simplicity and beauty
yet highly original, very daring.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.276
- Voilà, monsieur.
- We need you for two things only.

31:15.400 --> 31:18.073
To open the safe and deliver the note.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.156
A few hours' work.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.840
And for this, a million dollars.

31:24.320 --> 31:27.790
Which we will, of course, split three ways.

31:27.920 --> 31:32.277
Half for me. The other half
to be divided between you two.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.879
But you already agreed.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.070
Gentlemen, it's a well-known fact

31:36.200 --> 31:41.069
that I am not only a brilliant
safe-cracker, but a liar and a thief.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.516
Half for me, the other half
divided between you two.

31:46.640 --> 31:51.191
Very well. I will pick
you up with a car at four.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.356
Until four, then.

31:55.720 --> 31:59.076
And, Rick, resist at all costs

31:59.200 --> 32:03.751
your continuous and overwhelming
impulse to perform the double-cross.

32:03.880 --> 32:08.271
We will not this time be so... understanding

32:08.400 --> 32:11.278
as we were last year in Tangier.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.676
Now, Miss Simpson, having
established a climate of suspense,

32:30.800 --> 32:35.271
intrigue and romance, we've arrived
once more at that magic moment.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.073
The boy and the girl meet.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.072
OK. Now we need more conflict.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.475
A new character, maybe.

32:48.600 --> 32:52.275
I've got it! Seated nearby
is Rick's deadly enemy,

32:52.400 --> 32:56.313
Inspector, erm, Gillette of
the international police force.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.471
It is apparent he knows something
the audience does not know.

33:04.520 --> 33:09.275
And now, Miss Simpson, we have set
the wheels of our plot in motion

33:09.400 --> 33:12.278
and inflamed the audience
with a passionate desire

33:12.400 --> 33:14.595
to find out what happens next.

33:14.720 --> 33:18.076
And I don't blame them. I'm
dying to find out myself.

33:18.200 --> 33:21.078
We can pause for a few pages of chitchat,

33:21.200 --> 33:24.476
getting-to-know-you stuff,
which I do so brilliantly.

33:24.600 --> 33:29.674
The question is, where should this
charming little scene be played?

33:35.520 --> 33:36.475
At lunch!

33:37.600 --> 33:41.275
Yes, he takes her to a beautiful
restaurant for lunch in the Bois.

33:41.400 --> 33:46.076
Ridiculous. She wouldn't go off with
a man who picked her up in a square.

33:46.200 --> 33:48.316
I mean, he's a perfect... stranger.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.795
Miss Simpson, nobody's perfect.

33:50.920 --> 33:54.469
Why, he asks, as they
dance and dance and dance,

33:54.600 --> 33:57.273
are you so sad when everyone is so gay?

33:57.400 --> 33:59.675
And then a suggestion from
the mysterious stranger.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.268
If you try raising your upper lip,

34:02.400 --> 34:05.790
you might at least create
the illusion of a smile.

34:05.920 --> 34:10.471
That being somewhat of a disaster,
he really has to turn on the charm.

34:10.600 --> 34:14.070
Do you know the word serendipity,
he asks. She shakes her head.

34:14.199 --> 34:17.670
- What does it mean?
- Why, Miss Simpson, I'm surprised.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.074
It means opening your eyes each morning

34:20.199 --> 34:23.476
and looking at the bright new
day and going absolutely ape!

34:23.600 --> 34:26.068
- Serendipity?
- Right.

34:26.199 --> 34:29.476
- Are you making it up?
- No, serendipity's a real word.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.672
Actually, it means the ability
to find pleasure, excitement

34:32.800 --> 34:34.870
and happiness in anything that occurs.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.478
No matter how unexpected.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.397
Serendipity!

34:38.520 --> 34:42.274
He explains the word, in a much
more fascinating way than I did,

34:42.400 --> 34:44.277
and at the right moment proposes

34:44.400 --> 34:47.072
a glorious lunch in the Bois. She's tempted.

34:47.199 --> 34:48.679
But don't you think...?

34:48.800 --> 34:52.475
Miss Simpson, he's not asking
her for a weekend at a motel

34:52.600 --> 34:55.672
in Asbury Park, New Jersey.
He's inviting her to lunch!

34:55.800 --> 34:59.588
Now, don't you think if he were
terribly terribly charming, she'd go?

34:59.720 --> 35:01.073
- Well...
- Serendipity.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.670
Alright, maybe. If he promises it's
just lunch and that's absolutely all.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.679
He promises. Unless she can think
of something she'd like to do after.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.872
- Which she won't!
- Seren... Alright, then.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.676
He hails a horse and carriage and
they go off to the Bois. Settled?

35:16.800 --> 35:20.270
Settled. And now I suppose
we ought to write it.

35:20.400 --> 35:22.914
Not at all. The audience is ahead of us.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.873
They've known she'll have
lunch with him for an hour.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.956
But how do we get from the square

35:28.080 --> 35:30.275
through the charm and
serendipity you do so brilliantly?

35:30.400 --> 35:33.233
In motion pictures we have a simple device

35:33.360 --> 35:36.511
which takes care of exactly
this situation. The dissolve.

35:36.640 --> 35:39.871
Over the years, the
audience has been conditioned

35:40.000 --> 35:42.878
to understand that when a scene fades away,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.673
like an old soldier, before their very eyes,

35:45.800 --> 35:48.872
and another scene gradually
appears to take its place,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.470
a certain amount of time has
elapsed. So, Miss Simpson,

35:52.600 --> 35:54.670
we dissolve...

35:55.720 --> 35:59.599
We dissolve slowly and lingeringly...

35:59.720 --> 36:01.472
.. to the Bois.

36:02.320 --> 36:05.073
A hansom cab bearing our handsome couple

36:05.200 --> 36:08.078
clippety-clops its way
past waterfalls and trees

36:08.200 --> 36:10.077
toward a magnificent restaurant.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.555
Notice, Miss Simpson, how cleverly I play

36:12.680 --> 36:15.194
our suspense-filled
melodrama against a background

36:15.320 --> 36:17.675
of holiday serendipity in "gay Paris".

36:30.800 --> 36:35.078
We will spare the audience
the pages of dreary small talk,

36:35.200 --> 36:37.668
and get to the heart of the matter

36:37.800 --> 36:42.794
by the simple use of the device
I'vejust explained, the dissolve.

36:42.920 --> 36:45.673
Who are you? What do you do?

36:45.800 --> 36:49.270
Who am I and what do I do? I'm nobody

36:49.400 --> 36:51.470
and I've done everything and nothing.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.478
Driven racing cars, white hunter for a while,

36:54.600 --> 36:58.070
piano player in a rather curious
establishment in Buenos Aires.

36:58.200 --> 37:00.668
This and that, everything and nothing.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.234
The curse of having been born too rich.

37:03.360 --> 37:07.876
Oh, I know what you mean. The
curse of having been born too rich.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.594
That's why I left the castle for Paris.

37:10.720 --> 37:11.675
The castle?

37:11.800 --> 37:15.110
We've got houses all over
the world, but my favourite

37:15.240 --> 37:18.869
was our summer place in Deauville
with its own private zoo.

37:19.000 --> 37:24.791
As a little girl, on Sundays, if I'd
been good, I could feed the giraffes.

37:24.920 --> 37:29.710
Giraffes? Don't tell me
that you had giraffes, too?

37:29.840 --> 37:32.593
- You mean, you...?
- But of course.

37:32.720 --> 37:37.111
Oh, what fun! Both of us
having had giraffes as children.

37:37.240 --> 37:39.629
It's a small world, isn't it?

37:42.920 --> 37:45.480
Voilà! Madame. Monsieur.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.275
- To Rick.
- To Gabby.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.719
If I may recommend...?

37:51.840 --> 37:53.637
I prefer to do it myself.

37:53.760 --> 37:58.276
To begin, we'll have paper-thin
slices of prosciutto ham

37:58.400 --> 38:02.279
wrapped carefully around well-ripened
sections of Persian melon.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.594
To follow, a touch of Dover sole

38:05.720 --> 38:08.678
sautéed lightly in champagne and butter.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.552
With that, a bottle of...

38:10.680 --> 38:12.272
Pouilly-Fuissé?

38:12.400 --> 38:14.868
'59 will do. And after that...

38:16.600 --> 38:18.875
.. we'll have a Chateaubriand for two.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.072
Erm, make that for four. Charred and brown.

38:22.200 --> 38:26.671
Nay, black on the outside
and gloriously rare on the in.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.872
With the beef, we'll have white asparagus

38:30.000 --> 38:33.072
and a bottle of Château
Lafite Rothschild '47.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.276
And for dessert, an enormous
order of fraises des bois...

38:37.400 --> 38:39.868
Served, of course, with globs of heavy cream

38:40.000 --> 38:44.676
so thick you can put it on with
a shovel, s'il vous plaît. Mwah!

38:44.800 --> 38:48.270
You heard the lady. And make
it snappy, we're starving.

38:48.400 --> 38:52.598
Now, while awaiting the
paper-thin slices of prosciutto,

38:52.720 --> 38:54.711
so skilfully wrapped around

38:54.840 --> 38:57.070
perfect sections of ripened Persian melon...

38:57.200 --> 38:59.668
Please, stop, I can't stand it.

39:00.600 --> 39:05.276
Do you think they'll really do
the sole in champagne and butter?

39:05.400 --> 39:08.073
Mm-hmm. In any case, while we're waiting,

39:08.200 --> 39:10.589
I wonder if the lovely Miss Gabrielle Simpson

39:10.720 --> 39:13.473
would join the very
talented Mr Richard Benson

39:13.600 --> 39:18.071
for a small dry aperitif? I think
she's earned it. They both have.

39:18.200 --> 39:21.476
Alright. I think that would be very nice.

39:21.600 --> 39:24.273
I didn't really like Rick at first

39:24.400 --> 39:27.278
but he's beginning to grow on me.

39:30.320 --> 39:32.197
Mmmm...

39:34.120 --> 39:36.588
So, you find Rick growing on you?

39:36.720 --> 39:39.075
Oh, yes, I think he's very attractive.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.272
Important. The reaction
of the female audience.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.595
Alright. Lunch is over. The martinis,

39:44.720 --> 39:48.474
the two different wines and
brandy have had their effect,

39:48.600 --> 39:52.070
and a glorious dream-like
glow is settling over them.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.872
The pages, Miss Simpson.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.073
Those that we have covered so
far with our fabulous prose.

40:05.720 --> 40:10.271
Here you will notice, as advertised
in our discussion earlier on today,

40:10.400 --> 40:13.119
the opening, a series of
interestingly photographed

40:13.240 --> 40:15.390
establishing shots.

40:15.520 --> 40:19.069
And here, the boy and the girl,

40:19.200 --> 40:24.069
if a middle-aged mysterious stranger
can indeed be called a boy, meet.

40:24.200 --> 40:26.395
You're not middle-aged, Mr Benson.

40:26.520 --> 40:29.671
In fact, I think you're
remarkably well preserved.

40:29.800 --> 40:33.679
As chilling a compliment as
I've ever received, Miss Simpson.

40:33.800 --> 40:37.873
However, to continue, pages eight, nine,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.070
ten of romantic chitchat.

40:40.200 --> 40:43.272
- Which you do so brilliantly.
- Why, thank you.

40:43.400 --> 40:47.871
Now you can feel the unconscious
attraction between the two,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.878
the tremulous beginnings of love.

40:52.600 --> 40:56.115
You see how easy it is
with professional know-how

40:56.240 --> 40:58.071
and experience on your side?

41:00.000 --> 41:03.470
Miss Simpson, I don't think you realise this,

41:03.600 --> 41:07.275
but a writer's life is a terribly lonely one.

41:08.920 --> 41:12.071
- Mr Benson.
- Hmm?

41:12.200 --> 41:15.476
Have you any idea at all what happens next?

41:17.000 --> 41:21.471
Do you, Miss Simpson, have
any idea what will happen?

41:21.600 --> 41:23.477
Well...

41:26.920 --> 41:30.629
We've got to remember that no
matter how charming he seems,

41:30.760 --> 41:34.878
he is a liar and a thief.
It says so right here.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.592
Mr Benson...

41:44.520 --> 41:46.875
I do know what happens next.

41:47.720 --> 41:50.678
What happens next is the second switch.

41:50.800 --> 41:54.475
The audience gasps as they
realise they have been fooled.

41:54.600 --> 41:58.275
He has plied her with martinis,
white wine, red wine, brandy,

41:58.400 --> 42:02.188
for only one reason. To make her drunk!

42:03.640 --> 42:08.077
Which incidentally she is not.
Not at all, whatever he thinks.

42:08.200 --> 42:11.476
Now, as he forces one last brandy

42:11.600 --> 42:13.670
to her unwilling lips...

42:17.320 --> 42:20.437
Poor ingenuous girl. Charmed
and serendipitied into believing

42:20.560 --> 42:25.270
she was safe in the hands of
this suntanned handsome American.

42:27.200 --> 42:30.510
Alas, things are not what
they seem. Not at all.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.870
The music turns ominous.

42:42.720 --> 42:46.713
And she becomes aware of
the danger that she is in.

42:47.720 --> 42:51.872
The mysterious stranger. Who
is he? What is he really like?

42:52.000 --> 42:55.276
And why does he keep nibbling on her neck?

43:04.000 --> 43:07.959
Don't be frightened, my
dear. It's only a bat.

43:08.080 --> 43:11.516
The creatures of the night are my friends.

43:21.320 --> 43:25.359
I know why you nibble on my neck.
You're some kind of werewolf.

43:25.480 --> 43:28.677
No, no, my dear.

43:29.720 --> 43:31.870
I'm a vampire.

43:53.600 --> 43:55.670
The inner reaches of these caverns

43:55.800 --> 43:58.872
make an ideal setting for my laboratory.

44:23.120 --> 44:25.873
And yet, there's something about his eyes.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.594
Even though they are rather bloodshot.

44:28.720 --> 44:33.271
A vampire's life must be a
terribly lonely one. But no!

44:33.400 --> 44:37.188
Not for nothing has she made a
comprehensive study of depravity.

44:37.320 --> 44:41.154
Some girls may let vampires nibble
their necks on the first date,

44:41.280 --> 44:44.431
but not our Gabby. She tears
free from his evil grasp

44:44.560 --> 44:46.676
and the chase is on!

45:40.320 --> 45:42.515
- Vous êtes
Peau-Rouge? - Oui.

45:42.640 --> 45:43.595
Moi aussi.

46:09.120 --> 46:13.477
He's caught her, he's caught her.
No, Gabby, you can't give in now.

46:13.600 --> 46:16.068
You fought him in the cave, on the beaches,

46:16.200 --> 46:19.510
you fought him on the plains. That's it
- planes!

46:51.320 --> 46:53.675
Her face registers terror.

46:53.800 --> 46:57.076
Mr Benson, Mr Benson, she's killed him!

47:00.320 --> 47:03.676
There, there, Miss Simpson,
it's perfectly alright.

47:04.320 --> 47:06.959
In your defence, it's been a hard day

47:07.080 --> 47:09.674
and you've had a good deal to drink.

47:09.800 --> 47:12.075
Anyway, he had it coming to him.

47:12.200 --> 47:15.988
Plying her with all that
booze, making her drunk.

47:16.120 --> 47:19.510
Which incidentally she
is not. Not in the least.

47:19.640 --> 47:22.837
- Of course not.
- Not only did she kill him,

47:22.960 --> 47:26.077
but when I think of that poor horse...

47:26.200 --> 47:28.998
The way she beat him with that terrible whip.

47:29.120 --> 47:32.715
Anyway, I think she had it coming to her.

47:32.840 --> 47:34.592
That was what?

47:34.720 --> 47:39.669
Whatever he planned to do to her.
Why did she make such a fuss, anyway?

47:39.800 --> 47:44.078
It's not as if he was some
kind of vampire or something.

47:44.200 --> 47:46.668
Actually, I think he's very attractive.

47:51.840 --> 47:55.549
Miss Simpson, I think you should
go to bed and get some sleep.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.399
You do? What about you?

47:58.520 --> 48:00.875
I wish to think. Now, Miss Simpson,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.992
if you'll please go in there and lie down.

48:04.120 --> 48:07.908
Maybe for a few hours.
But if you do get an idea,

48:08.040 --> 48:11.476
and I know you will, you
must promise to wake me.

48:11.600 --> 48:12.589
Sure.

48:12.720 --> 48:14.073
Promise?

48:17.320 --> 48:19.072
I promise.

48:20.120 --> 48:21.872
Alright, then.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.877
Good night, Mr Benson.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.877
Good night, Miss Simpson.

48:28.800 --> 48:30.677
Good night.

48:30.800 --> 48:32.472
Good night.

49:01.320 --> 49:04.278
Operator, I'd like to place a call

49:04.400 --> 49:07.073
to Mr Alexander Meyerheim in Cannes.

49:09.520 --> 49:13.672
It's one-thirty. You can
probably find him at the casino.

49:15.720 --> 49:20.271
Erm... Ah, Benson. Mr Richard Benson calling.

49:21.320 --> 49:23.072
Person to person.

49:23.200 --> 49:24.872
I'll hold on.

49:33.520 --> 49:35.476
Dear Alex.

49:41.720 --> 49:43.039
Dear Alex,...

49:43.920 --> 49:46.480
.. it is my unpleasant duty to inform you

49:46.600 --> 49:50.479
that The Girl Who Stole the
Eiffel Tower will not take place.

49:50.600 --> 49:51.874
You see, my friend,

49:52.000 --> 49:56.471
that there's no point for
you to come to Paris on Sunday

49:56.600 --> 50:00.275
to read the script,
because there is no script.

50:01.600 --> 50:04.273
As I see it, there will be no...

50:05.480 --> 50:08.278
Yeah? Comment?

50:11.600 --> 50:15.388
Try him at the chemin de
fer game. The big table.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.678
Excuse me, I forgot to cover Richelieu.

50:54.160 --> 50:56.071
Good night.

51:02.720 --> 51:06.679
Oh, Mr Benson. Please don't
think I'm quitting on you.

51:06.800 --> 51:10.679
I'll be right here when
you need me. Good night.

51:20.520 --> 51:22.272
Operator.

51:23.120 --> 51:24.872
Cancel that call.

54:48.120 --> 54:50.076
Unfortunately, Miss Simpson,...

54:51.520 --> 54:53.875
.. we are not writing a musical.

54:59.920 --> 55:04.994
Mr Benson, you did all these
pages last night? All by yourself?

55:05.120 --> 55:08.078
While some of us were snug in our bed,

55:08.200 --> 55:10.873
other more productive citizens were up

55:11.000 --> 55:13.070
toiling in the vineyards
of beautiful letters.

55:13.200 --> 55:16.078
I'm only sorry that you,
as a fledgling writer,

55:16.200 --> 55:19.476
weren't present to observe
with your own big magic eyes

55:19.600 --> 55:21.591
a seasoned professional in action.

55:21.720 --> 55:24.075
I was, in those few short hours,

55:24.200 --> 55:28.273
the great DiMaggio, going back,
back, back for the high-fly ball.

55:28.400 --> 55:32.473
I was Manolete in Seville, going
over the horns for the kill.

55:32.600 --> 55:36.639
And missing, fortunately, because
I can't stand the sight of blood.

55:36.760 --> 55:39.479
I was Pablo Picasso, deftly...

55:40.920 --> 55:45.152
.. adding the third eye to
a portrait of his lady love.

55:45.920 --> 55:47.672
I was...

55:48.720 --> 55:50.995
How do you spell ingenuous?

55:51.120 --> 55:53.873
I- N-
G-E-N-U-O-U-S.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.877
I was afraid of that.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.471
In addition to the nine and
a half yards of pages I wrote,

56:00.600 --> 56:03.592
I discovered some errors
in the earlier pages,

56:03.720 --> 56:07.508
which I corrected, dealing
basically with the character of Rick.

56:07.640 --> 56:11.269
I found I had, in a moment of insecurity,...

56:12.840 --> 56:14.876
.. underestimated the brilliance of the man.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.276
No simple safe-cracker
he, but a master criminal,

56:18.400 --> 56:21.073
wanted by the police of three continents.

56:21.200 --> 56:23.668
The dazzling scheme has been worked out,

56:23.800 --> 56:27.679
step by painful step, for
over a year by Rick himself.

56:27.800 --> 56:30.394
The two other characters are just employees.

56:30.520 --> 56:33.080
That brings us back to where we were.

56:33.200 --> 56:36.078
Rick and Gabby have
demolished a glorious lunch

56:36.200 --> 56:39.351
and it's almost four o'clock,
time for the car to arrive.

56:39.480 --> 56:41.596
Page 14.

56:41.720 --> 56:43.676
Sit down and brace yourself.

56:44.520 --> 56:47.080
Here comes the switch on the switch.

56:47.200 --> 56:50.795
In a minute and a half, you
and the audience will gasp

56:50.920 --> 56:52.672
as you realise you've been fooled.

56:52.800 --> 56:56.236
Things are not as they
seem. Not at all. In fact,

56:57.360 --> 57:00.716
- the whole situation is reversed.
- Mr Benson...

57:00.840 --> 57:03.274
Miss Simpson, please don't sit there

57:03.400 --> 57:06.198
gazing at me in mute adoration.

57:06.320 --> 57:08.072
Read the script.

57:09.120 --> 57:12.078
Rick and Gabby are sitting
with brandy glasses before them.

57:12.200 --> 57:14.350
Her big magic eyes are shiny...

57:16.000 --> 57:18.673
I can't imagine a more marvellous lunch.

57:18.800 --> 57:22.759
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Please.

57:22.880 --> 57:26.668
And now I'll tell you the plans
for the rest of the afternoon.

57:26.800 --> 57:28.279
The rest of the afternoon?

57:28.400 --> 57:32.279
Exactly. My car and chauffeur
will pick us up here at four,

57:32.400 --> 57:35.676
for a tour of Paris to see how
the celebration's progressing,

57:35.800 --> 57:38.872
a brief stop at my office
to pick something up,

57:39.000 --> 57:41.673
and then on to a party in my honour

57:41.800 --> 57:43.950
at the restaurant in the Eiffel Tower.

57:47.320 --> 57:49.675
- Pardon. You are Monsieur Rick?
- Oui.

57:49.800 --> 57:54.590
Your chauffeur is here, sir. He
has an important message for you.

57:54.720 --> 57:56.472
Merci.

57:57.200 --> 57:59.077
Pardon me for a moment.

58:06.800 --> 58:08.597
It's almost four o'clock.

58:08.720 --> 58:10.472
I know.

58:10.600 --> 58:15.674
What's the matter? Are you mad?
Bringing a girl on a job like this!

58:15.800 --> 58:20.271
Our arrangement, François. You do
the driving and I do the planning.

58:20.400 --> 58:25.269
But the plan does not call
for the presence of a girl.

58:25.400 --> 58:29.279
The ability to improvise
brilliantly in a moment of crisis

58:29.400 --> 58:33.678
is one of the reasons I am a
highly paid, successful thief.

58:33.800 --> 58:37.588
If you will look to the
left, just behind you,

58:37.720 --> 58:39.870
as casually as possible,

58:40.400 --> 58:44.473
you will see, stupidly trying to
hide behind yesterday's newspaper,

58:44.600 --> 58:46.909
our old friend Inspector Gillette.

58:51.040 --> 58:53.679
What is he doing in Paris?

58:53.800 --> 58:56.189
Do you think he suspects something?

58:56.320 --> 58:58.834
Of course not. If so, I'm one step ahead.

58:58.960 --> 59:01.474
Why do you think I picked up the girl?

59:01.600 --> 59:03.670
Because she has big magic eyes.

59:03.800 --> 59:06.268
That, too, but actually I picked her up

59:06.400 --> 59:08.868
to throw our inspector friend off the scent.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.673
Never in his wildest
imagination would he think

59:11.800 --> 59:14.075
that the highly paid and successful Rick

59:14.200 --> 59:17.670
would be so foolish as to
take a girl along on a job.

59:17.800 --> 59:21.713
Therefore, that's exactly what I'm
going to do. She's a perfect cover.

59:23.440 --> 59:26.079
Meet you at the car in one minute.

59:37.120 --> 59:38.872
Shall we?

59:46.720 --> 59:49.188
My dear Gillette, our paths cross again.

59:49.320 --> 59:52.471
My dear Rick, what an
extraordinary coincidence.

59:52.600 --> 59:57.071
Monsieur Gillette is in a curious
way a business associate of mine.

59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.078
Enchanted. Any friend of
Rick's is a friend of mine.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:05.069
Please, enjoy your lunch. And I
beg of you, watch the calories.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.675
This, my friend, is a moment to savour.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.837
For three years I've waited,
and at last my brilliant,

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.679
highly paid professional
friend has risen to the bait.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:36.878
What he doesn't know, poor
Rick, is that the girl is ours.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.877
You're sure he suspected nothing?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.276
Inspector, my imitation of a
method actor was impeccable.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.675
I played the role internally, of course,

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.270
indicating all the basic
elements of this curious calling.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.676
The deep, almost lunatic narcissism.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.470
The lack of personal daintiness.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.477
The appalling grammar.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.672
Pops, it was... Sir, it
was flawless, brilliant.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.473
I came in on a motorbike
in wheat-coloured...

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.670
Now, please, don't get carried away.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.678
I remind you, you are
not the star of this drama

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:13.588
but merely a supporting player.
A very minor one, at that.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.678
If life, like the theatre,
came equipped with programmes,

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.679
your billing, way down on
the page and in tiny letters,

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.189
would simply be second policeman.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.879
As I was saying, what he
doesn't know, poor Rick,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.116
is that the girl is ours.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.836
Can we trust a creature of the streets,

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.349
with a police record as long as your arm?

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.074
Nothing will go wrong, my dear Philippe.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.476
There's a tiny chink in
Rick's armour. A pretty face.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.478
One way or another, using
such talent as she has,

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.592
the girl will extract from
him the details of the plan.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:54.475
The plan. But should they not
be followed? I have the car.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.273
There would be no point. Rick is a master.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.075
No policeman alive can stay on his
trail if he wishes to elude him.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.269
Yes...

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.799
- No.
- No.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.072
I shall have a glorious lunch,
everything to be cooked, of course,

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.192
in this remarkable
non-fattening safflower oil,

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.276
and eventually, having followed my luncheon

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.675
with several digestifs and a short walk,

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:20.510
rejoin my friend tonight for the
climax of his adventures at...

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:21.629
At...?

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.872
The Eiffel Tower? Brilliant,
Inspector. Brilliant.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.471
To the studio, François, please.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.192
Studio?

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.950
I said, I have to stop at my
office and pick something up there.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.878
Have you been inside a
motion-picture studio?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.673
No. Are you in the movie business?

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.756
In a way.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.668
The studio is particularly
marvellous on a holiday like this.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.075
Silent. Empty.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.272
The vast sound stages completely deserted.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:05.672
Like the night before Christmas,
not a creature is stirring.

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.670
Wait here, I won't be long.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.876
Hmm, nice-ish.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.991
Isn't it?

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.793
I don't understand. Are you an actor,

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.876
a writer, producer, director?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.877
Nothing so creative, I'm afraid.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.468
My interest in movies is purely financial.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.155
Gracious.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.555
I can't tell you how exciting this is...

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.672
This is for me. I just love movies.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.315
Not those terrible New Wave
pictures where nothing happens.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.396
But I like,...

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.034
.. erm, Westerns.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.913
Good old-fashioned pictures with switches

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:18.238
and switches on switches. Things like that.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.999
Do you have an emery board
on you? One of those things

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.192
- to file the nails?
- I think so.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.231
Thank you.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.876
I particularly like movies with
complicated robberies in, don't you?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.752
Absolutely.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.471
I know this sounds childish, but
next to pictures about robberies,

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.275
I think I like horror
pictures best. I always have.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.756
As a little girl, I was
madly in love with Dracula.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.552
My mother was very upset.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.274
She thought it was somehow... unhealthy.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:01.279
She used to say, that vampire's
old enough to be your father!

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:04.119
Whom, she would add, he
in many ways resembles.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.997
I'm glad.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.350
Not that your father resembled Dracula.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.790
Which he didn't. Not after
he had his teeth fixed.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.988
But that you are interested in pictures.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.793
That makes two things we have in common.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.480
Movies... and giraffes.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.874
Here are the keys. Meet you
at the gate in half an hour.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.670
Giraffes and movies... It's
a small world, isn't it?

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.597
Let me see that!

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.473
No, no. Please, Rick, you're hurting me.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.068
The lipstick. It's been written with.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.879
The napkin! The napkin you
gave Gillette. What was on it?

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.476
What was on it?

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.996
You...

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.557
Stop, Rick, stop. Or I'll
shoot. I swear I will.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.872
Mr Benson, what happens next?

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.270
I don't know. I don't know.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.872
That's as far as I got.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.069
- Mr Benson.
- Yes?

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.795
You know what I think?
I think we need another...

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.752
What would that be? A switch on a switch

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:28.678
on a switch on a switch. On a switch.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:33.270
I thought I knew movies, but
Roger Roussin was never like this.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:37.075
I wonder if he knows about
switches. And switches on switches.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:40.272
And switches on switches on
switches. I don't think so.

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.277
It would change his whole life.

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:46.871
Not only would they not play Scrabble
they would also not play Parcheesi.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.468
I must say, the mind reels.

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:54.675
Anyway, you know what I think?

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:59.999
Yes. You think she is not a creature
of the streets with a police record.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.189
You think she's an
American intelligence agent.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.231
Well, Miss Simpson,

01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:06.395
you happen to be wrong.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:10.274
Our Gabby happens to be that
most reliable, steadfast,

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:15.189
and you-cannot-miss-with-no-matter-
how- badly-you-write-it character

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:17.276
in all popular literature.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:20.073
The prostitute with a heart of gold.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.353
No, actually,

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:27.679
the P with the H of G is
secondmost. The most is Frankenstein.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.475
Sure, someone who creates or
remakes another human being

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.673
and either falls in love
with it or it destroys him.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.471
It can go either way.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.068
That's what gives it such flexibility.

01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:45.278
Miss Simpson, did you ever realise

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:49.678
that Frankenstein and My
Fair Lady are the same story?

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.076
One ends happily

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.395
and the other one doesn't.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.670
Think about that for a while.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.070
You smell wonderful.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:09.070
That's the bath oil. When I took
my bath earlier, I put bath oil in.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.468
Only a few drops, of course.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.070
For which I am most
grateful. For both our sakes.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:20.592
Ahem. And now, where were we?

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.075
Bang, bang, bang! That's where we were.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.997
Or rather, where you were.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.476
She was by the bed with a
gun, he was moving toward her.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.479
I don't see how Frankenstein
and My Fair Lady are the same.

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.591
Oh, yes, I do.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.190
Professor Higgins created Eliza and
Dr Frankenstein created the Monster.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.276
Oh, yes, of course.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.675
But don't tell anybody. I'm
saving it for the textbook

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.075
on the art of screenplay writing.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.475
Ah-ha, yeah, well...

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.275
He's chased her through the
jungle, all that. Blah, blah, blah.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.870
Passed the bathtub. If you
want a Richard Benson movie

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.869
without a bathtub, you're out of
your head. And into the bedroom.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.879
She pulls out a gun, blah,
blah, blah, blah, and...

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.837
My dear big magic-eyed,

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.872
bath-oil-scented
Miss Simpson,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.036
is where we are.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.996
Slowly,

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.270
Rick continues toward her.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.270
Go ahead. Pull the trigger.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.878
Don't reach for your gun, I'm warning you.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.678
- Cigarette?
- Thanks. Light?

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.917
Well, Rick,...

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:58.070
.. d'you mind if I get
out of these wet shoes?

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.073
And so my big magic-eyed Gabby,

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.474
who came to Paris to... live,...

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.876
.. turns out to be a spy
for the police. An informer.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.036
A common stool pigeon.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.277
No, Rick, don't say it!
It's that devil Gillette.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.472
Oh, how I hate him. He is relentless!

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:28.672
He'll stop at nothing
until he tracks you down.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.872
He'll never forgive himself
for last year in Tangier,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.675
or the year before in Hong
Kong. You are his obsession.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.678
He is a mad, overweight Captain Ahab,

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.429
searching down you, his
Moby Dick. His white whale.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:45.472
- And you?
- Me?

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.276
I'm nothing. A creature of the
streets with a long police record.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.676
He had me paroled to be the
luscious and irresistible bait

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:56.268
squirming on the hook he has prepared.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.949
If I do not extract the
plan you have been building

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.674
step by painful step for the last year,

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.268
my life, well, it's over.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.870
Back I go behind the bars,
matron in uniform once more,

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.879
no longer Gabrielle or
Gabby but simply... a number.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.752
If, however, I succeed...

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.393
And if you succeed?

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.192
Freedom!

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.359
What exactly do you have
to do to extract this plan?

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.076
Anything.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.794
- Anything?
- Anything. It's not so hard.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.595
I, too, in my own way, am
a highly paid professional.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:37.157
Not so highly paid as you, perhaps,
but still... a professional.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.676
We're two of a kind, you and I.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:44.476
There's no reason for us to be
enemies. We can perhaps be...

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.670
.. friends.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.677
Perhaps...

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.878
Their two bodies now moving as one

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.675
roll like turbulent breakers
crashing on an undiscovered shore.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.473
And now, now,...

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.111
.. we slowly...

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.196
.. and lingeringly...

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.276
.. dissolve...

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.876
Gracious.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.480
Exactly, Miss Simpson. Well said.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.273
You might even add heavens to Betsy.

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.276
What's wrong, don't you like it?

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:29.473
Oh, I like it, but can you get away with it?

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:32.558
Get away with it? Get away with what?

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:37.309
Well, that scene with them on
the bed is rather suggestive.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.795
Don't you think the censors will object?

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.388
How can they possibly object?

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.272
We dissolved, didn't we?

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.790
- Yes, but...
- Miss Simpson, as I said before,

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.480
a dissolve is a most useful device.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.672
Not only can it take you
from one place to another,

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.872
but it also leaves what's
happening on the screen

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.877
to your imagination.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.475
Now if I were you, Miss Simpson,

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.070
I would stop going to
those sinful art theatres,

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:10.671
and start seeing more good, wholesome
American family-type pictures.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.872
I don't know what you and the censors
think they're doing on that bed,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.074
but I take the position that
they're playing... Parcheesi.

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:40.671
As much as I've enjoyed our little
game, it's almost eight-thirty.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:45.878
Time for the climax of our
glorious day. We must be off.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.752
Off? Where to?

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.871
You know perfectly well where.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.390
The costume party at the
Eiffel Tower, to finish the job.

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:56.876
You mustn't. You can't go through
with the plan, whatever it is.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.310
Gillette will be there and the
place will be surrounded by police.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.396
Gillette was in Tangier last year.

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:06.559
The entire city was surrounded by
police. Now if you'll excuse me...

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.153
Where are you going?

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.869
To the wardrobe department, to
find something for us to wear.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.390
Quite alright. I always carry

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:49.674
a packet of bubble bath in my
purse and I'm getting on swimmingly.

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.676
Howdy,...

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.197
.. stranger.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.554
You must be the new schoolma'am.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:13.274
I hate to rush you, ma'am,
but it's getting late.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:17.276
How long will it take to get out of that tub,

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:20.153
into this costume and out to the car?

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:24.671
Absolutely no time at all...

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.075
And now, according to my master plan,

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.875
the time has come to take the
most dangerous step of all.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.070
Yes, Rick?

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.873
I must trust you and tell you the details.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.275
I can trust you, can't I, Gabby?

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:51.075
How can you ask, Rick? After our
Parcheesi game this afternoon,

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.272
I am yours for ever and ever and ever.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.391
Can I trust you, Gabby?

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.670
Can I really trust you?

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.595
In the back of this car are
28 cans of motion-picture film.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:17.076
The Eiffel Tower party is being
given by the picture's producer.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:22.877
Tell me the plan in a minute, Rick.
It's a long drive to the Eiffel Tower

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.673
and the traffic is heavy.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.676
Mr Benson...

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.676
Rick.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.274
Gabby, maybe, but I'm not...

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.678
Well, I'm not that kind of a girl.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:23.079
Oh, I can't stand girls
who say things like that.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.878
Oh, dear...

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:33.229
I guess maybe we are that kind of a girl.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.278
Exterior. Eiffel Tower. Night.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:49.276
Rick and Gabby have been
driving and driving and driving.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.073
Through all that marvellous traffic.

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:57.078
The tower is ablaze.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.476
Richard, how can I type
if you're going to...?

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.955
Alright, alright...

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.399
The tower is ablaze

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.875
and chauffeur-driven
limousines are pulling up.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.278
Miss Simpson, how can I dictate
if you're going to...? Hmm...

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.190
Trust me, darling.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:24.073
I do. Here we go.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:32.672
And now, darling, Rick and Gabby
make their way to the elevator

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:36.873
which will carry them and us
to the inevitable party scene,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.072
so dear to the hearts of
movie directors everywhere.

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.589
It's summer time and the vita is dolce.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.871
Breakfast is at Tiffany's
and everybody is high.

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:15.271
And now that the director
has distracted the audience

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.072
with these totally extraneous vignettes,

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.273
he reluctantly returns to the
plot and another new character.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.595
The producer. Host and victim.

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:26.678
Who looks remarkably like
my producer and victim,

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.472
Mr Alexander Meyerheim.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.674
If you look left, just behind
you, as casually as possible,

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.870
you will see that idiot Gillette

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.468
dressed appropriately
enough as an executioner.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.075
- Ready, darling?
- Ready, darling.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.870
Excuse me for a moment, darling.

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:19.875
You're late.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.879
Untrue, Gillette. Everything is
going precisely according to plan.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.594
- And the plan, you have it?
- Of course.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:30.872
While not exactly highly paid,
I'm at least... a professional.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:58.955
Well?

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:02.789
If you will kindly read this,
I believe the entire situation

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:04.672
will become clear immediately.

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.670
At this very moment, he's
delivering the ransom note.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.556
- The ransom note?
- Exactly.

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:20.275
He has in the trunk of
his car 28 reels of film.

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.675
They are the negative and
only existing work print

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.758
of the producer's just-completed
six-million-dollar spectacle,

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:28.075
The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:32.398
You are certain you have both the
negative and the only work print?

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:33.873
Absolutely.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.912
And it is your serious
intention to destroy them?

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.871
Unless you turn over the key

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.151
to your safe-deposit box
in your bank in Casablanca.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.039
My dear boy, I haven't the faintest idea

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.879
who you are. But you are beautiful. Whoo!

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.876
Absolutely beautiful.

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:58.759
Not only that, you've saved my life.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:03.476
The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel
Tower is frankly a disaster.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.273
The title is symbolic. She
doesn't actually steal it.

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.277
Or I don't think she does.

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.675
The end's so confusing it's hard to tell.

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:15.430
Anyway, the script is so ghastly
it could never possibly be released.

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:18.518
I was finished. Done for. This party tonight

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:23.077
was planned as a final farewell
gesture. A sort of swan song.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:26.875
At midnight, when the cheque was
presented, I planned to sign it,

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.594
add a lavish if purely imaginary tip,

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:34.475
and then, as the fireworks were
exploding in the black velvet sky,

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:38.275
to hurl myself from the top
of this grotesque edifice.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.278
And now, suddenly at the last minute,

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:45.313
in the nick of time
- don't tell me there isn't someone up there

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.829
who watches over whimsical movie producers
- you appear!

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.712
I can't believe it.

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:54.874
If you swear to me that
you will destroy this film,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.070
hook, line and sinker,

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:02.672
not only will I give you the key to my safe
-  deposit box in Casablanca,

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.194
but we will split the insurance,

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.878
60-40.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.433
50-50.

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:14.439
Oh, my darling, darling boy.
If ever you consider going into

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.075
the motion-picture business,
do not hesitate to call me.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.998
I've searched for a partner
like you all my life.

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.270
We understand each other perfectly.

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.270
You are so beautiful...!

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.676
It's a rugged but curiously sensitive face.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.870
It's so beautiful...!

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:38.471
His plane is waiting for
him at Le Bourget Airport.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.672
His chauffeur's even now
warming up the engines.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.475
Good girl. Tomorrow, your entire
police record will disappear

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.275
oh-so-mysteriously from my
files and you will be free.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.436
Thank you, my dear Gillette.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.353
And now, Gillette, if
you could quite casually

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.268
dance me across the floor and
over to the gentlemen's lounge.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.073
You fool. You little fool. He's using you

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:14.476
like he did that poor unfortunate
girl last year in Tangier.

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.068
Keep dancing, Gillette.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.875
I should have known! I should.
That man is irresistible to women.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.560
He is, my dear Gillette.

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.079
Keep dancing.

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.668
You fool. You little fool.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.876
I've worked the whole
thing out with my analyst.

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.868
I don't really hate Inspector Gillette,

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.275
I just feel sorry for him.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:59.676
He insists on projecting
himself into the starring role

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.678
and relegating me to some minor character.

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:07.476
Got me waiting for him
outside the Eiffel Tower? OK.

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:10.876
Got me saying lines like,
"Brilliant, Inspector, brilliant,"

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.719
or, erm, "I have the car here, sir. "

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:17.589
Maurice!

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:20.473
Inspector, I am Philippe!

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:25.399
It doesn't matter. Rick is making
his escape at Bourget Airport.

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:27.476
Where is my car?

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:31.198
Erm, I have the car right here, sir.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.276
You read that line beautifully, Maurice.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.868
Inspector, please. I...

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.468
I am not Maurice. I am Philippe.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:43.871
Dear boy, you are a minor character
and your name is of no importance.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.833
Now, you were saying something about the car?

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:51.398
I have the car right here, sir.

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.476
- Faster, Maurice, faster!
- Faster, Philippe, faster.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:17.479
I keep forgetting. My God,
you are a dull character.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.910
Even in the non-taxing
role of second policeman.

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.511
Bourget Airport, quickly!

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.994
But if you are the inspector who was...?

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.033
You are third policeman and should
have no lines. Shut up and drive.

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.678
- Do you know what this is?
- The key!

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:52.758
The key to our future. One million dollars

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.396
in small unmarked bills' worth
of happiness for the two of us.

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.793
Inspector Gillette of Interpol
here. Calling all voitures.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.751
Faster!

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:40.073
Erm, the gate, sir, it is closed.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.952
Go through it, you fool.

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:59.874
- Wait here. I'll take him alone.
- Inspector, can I speak to you?

01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:05.751
You're Rick.

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:10.078
- I don't understand...
- No, you're not supposed to.

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.555
Can't you get it through your mind?

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:15.672
You're only a bit part.
Nobody cares about you.

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:18.473
You're a mere literary convenience.

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:22.479
Someone for the hero to punch
in the jaw at the correct moment.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:24.795
And that moment, I'm happy to state,

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.876
has finally arrived.

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.956
Stop, Rick!

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:42.593
Stop or I'll shoot!

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:45.475
Philippe.

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:53.152
Mauri... Philippe.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.195
Darling...

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:13.869
It's alright. Perhaps it's better this way.

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:19.873
No, my darling, we'll make it to Casablanca.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.073
And when we get there, we'll
buy a darling little castle...

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.077
With its own...

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.791
.. private zoo.

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:30.956
And will there be giraffes?

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.872
Of course...

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.277
Giraffes.

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:45.670
If this is what it means to be a cop...

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.476
You're...

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.670
.. first policeman now.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:12.279
Thus having proved once
again that crime does not pay,

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.675
unless you happen to be me.

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.678
Fade out.

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:21.272
The end.

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:31.070
Well, there it is.

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:34.078
All 130-odd pages of it.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:37.276
Finished with...

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.070
.. hours to spare.

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:44.797
It's wonderful, Richard.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:47.878
Only, does it have to end that way?

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.878
I mean, Philippe could miss when he shoots,

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:54.234
and then Rick could tell the Inspector

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:58.876
where the stolen film cans
are and give him back the key.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.072
He could explain that now that he's met Gabby

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:05.476
he's retiring from the
liar-and-a-thief business,

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:09.388
and then the Inspector might...
let them go away together.

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:13.149
It could be the last
big switch on the switch.

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.838
Couldn't it?

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.678
It won't work.

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:21.078
You see, he is a liar and a thief.

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:24.875
And he's been one for too
long. He can't retire now.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.276
In addition to which, he
has become, I'm afraid,...

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.078
.. a hack.

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:37.272
He may think he's all those
things but she knows he's not.

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.475
What gives her that curious idea?

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.672
She's been with him constantly
for the last few days.

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.555
She's seen him shaking with
terror, exhausted, ready to quit.

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:52.672
She's watched him pull
himself together again and...

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:57.195
.. she's also seen him be warm...

01:33:57.320 --> 01:33:59.276
.. and tender.

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.191
And funny.

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:05.676
Not famous-international-wit
funny but really funny.

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:09.677
Do you think she's an idiot?

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:14.316
Do you think she doesn't
know what kind of man he is?

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:15.998
Or what he needs?

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:23.672
And what he
needs is L-O-V-E?

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:32.077
Uh-uh.

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:35.070
It's too late.

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.395
He's 43 years old.

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:39.670
Or will be this October.

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.470
He's been married twice,

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.670
both times disastrously,

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:50.469
and there have been too many
years of... too much dough,

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.829
too much bad writing

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:55.518
and too much whisky.

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:01.673
He's got nothing left inside to give.

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:07.592
Even if he could, which he can't.

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:12.396
But that's not true, Richard.
You can, you have. I just love it.

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:13.714
No, you don't.

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:15.673
It's lousy.

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:20.475
In any case, the problem is,...

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:25.880
.. you're not in love with the script.

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:28.477
You're in love with me.

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.838
And why shouldn't you be?

01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:34.679
Suddenly, waltzing into your life

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.677
comes this charming,

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.268
relatively handsome stranger.

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:41.672
Me.

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.874
Smooth as silk, with a highly
practised line of chatter,

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:52.076
specifically designed to knock
relatively unsophisticated chicks

01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:55.875
like you, Miss Simpson, right on their ears.

01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.959
Which I'm terribly afraid I've done.

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:07.469
Well, if it's the last decent
thing I do in this world,

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.875
and it very well may be,

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.670
I'm going to fix that.

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:16.356
I'm going to send you packing,

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.471
Miss Simpson.

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:22.280
Before I cause you serious...

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:27.073
.. and irrevocable harm.

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.476
You want the truth?

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.676
Of course you don't.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.070
I'll give it to you anyway.

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:43.279
I do not give one damn about anything,

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:46.597
certainly not my work, as you so touchingly

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.676
and ingenuously call it.

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.472
Well, that's not true.

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:58.199
There is something I care about. Money.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.470
And good whisky.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.475
I am, as you've probably noticed,

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.477
rather fond of that.

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.872
But my work?

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:16.197
That's a hideous little something

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:19.073
that must occur five days out of the year,

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.794
so I can spend the other 360

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:24.798
in the manner to which I have become -

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:28.469
and fully intend to remain
- accustomed.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.676
To you, Richard Benson.

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:38.671
To you and your glorious professional know
- how.

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:50.680
Long may you wave.

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:55.472
And may you... go on...

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.472
.. fooling...

01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:05.278
.. the people.

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.872
Miss Simpson?

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:10.672
Miss Simpson!

01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:25.272
Gabrielle?

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:44.112
- Pardon, Maurice.
- Maurice? No, no. Philippe.

01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:46.674
Oh, you don't even know when a joke is over.

01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:55.076
Why, Mr Benson, what are you doing here?

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:59.398
Miss Simpson, stop overacting. You
know very well what I'm doing here.

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:02.478
Of all the hokey cornball
grade-B picture devices.

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:05.273
She forgot the bird, she forgot the bird...

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:08.153
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:11.078
Girl leaves bird. Boy has
to come looking for girl.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:14.078
I've written that scene
a thousand times myself.

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:17.397
Always works, of course. That's point one.

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:21.399
Point two. How dare you quit
me when we haven't even started?

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:23.476
Point three...

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:26.068
I love you. Miss Simpson,

01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:31.069
if you don't feel up to the job,
tell me now. I'll get someone else.

01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:33.998
Oh, no, I'm perfectly capable.

01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:37.669
Very well, then, I hold here in my hand

01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.758
130-some-odd
pages of contrived

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:43.713
and utterly preposterous,
totally unmotivated...

01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:46.274
Oh, if you could only say it in pictures.

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.516
Come on, we've got a screenplay to write.

01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:51.871
Not starting from scratch, of course.
We've got two great characters.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.471
She's sweet and bright and very,
very beautiful, and he, well,...

01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:00.878
.. he's gone straight, rather dull.
We need something to jazz him up.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.878
Find something for him to
do, some physical action.

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:07.989
To accentuate the masculine image.

01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:10.350
There's something in American
movies, a terrible cliché,

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.472
but you did use it in the script.

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.477
Oh, yes...

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:21.758
I think maybe we should,... like, split.

01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:54.671
Richard, this new movie you're
going to write, what is it about?

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.279
It's a love story, naturally.

01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:00.678
It will have a happy ending? He
won't be shot running for a plane?

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.995
On the contrary, Miss Simpson.

01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:05.076
The music soars and there,

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.873
totally oblivious of the
fireworks, the fountains

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.468
and the holiday-mad throngs,

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:14.878
they fall happily and tenderly
into each other's arms.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.878
- I know what happens next.
- You do?

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.675
The two enormous and highly
paid heads come together

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:24.268
for that ultimate and inevitable moment.

01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:27.278
The final, earth-moving,

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:30.278
studio-rent-paying,
theatre-filling,

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.270
popcorn-selling...

01:45:34.305 --> 01:45:40.859
