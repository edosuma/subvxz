00:03.295 --> 00:05.756
Your grandfather called
and told me to tell you...

00:05.839 --> 00:08.634
he's bringing you back
something very special from Prague.

00:08.717 --> 00:11.220
How amazing is it
that he's going to Prague?

00:11.303 --> 00:13.931
It's supposed to be lovely.
Dramatic castles everywhere.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.892
The cell that Vaclav Havel was held in
is now a hostel.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.936
You can stay there for $50 a night.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.147
Maybe on our trip to Europe
we could go there and stay in his cell.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.149
Absolutely. Then we should go to Turkey...

00:24.191 --> 00:26.276
and stay in that place
from Midnight Express.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.029
- Lorelai, what are you doing?
- Getting rid of the avocado.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.864
Since when do you not like avocado?

00:30.948 --> 00:35.202
Since the day I said, 'Gross. What is this?'
And you said, 'Avocado. '

00:35.369 --> 00:36.828
I'm focusing on you now.

00:36.912 --> 00:39.498
Tell me all about
the Chilton formal next week.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.666
There's a formal?

00:40.749 --> 00:43.418
- How do you know about the formal?
- Yeah, how do you know?

00:43.502 --> 00:46.672
- I read my Chilton newsletter.
- Since when do you get a newsletter?

00:46.713 --> 00:49.508
As a major contributor
to Rory's education...

00:49.591 --> 00:52.803
I figured I had the right to ask for
a newsletter to be sent to me.

00:52.886 --> 00:53.887
Are you serious?

00:53.971 --> 00:56.223
It's a good thing, too,
since you don't read yours.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.142
One of us should be up-to-date
on the goings-on at her school.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.395
Mom, I read my newsletter.

01:01.478 --> 01:02.938
- You did?
- That's right.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.815
What was the picture on the cover?

01:04.897 --> 01:08.527
It was a picture of a really rich kid in plaid.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.447
- It's a spotted owl.
- In plaid.

01:12.531 --> 01:16.201
The owls are endangered, and Chilton
is taking donations to help them.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.578
You gave a very nice one,
in case you're interested.

01:18.662 --> 01:22.249
Don't be giving donations on Rory's behalf.
I'll do that.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.501
How can you
when you don't read the newsletter?

01:24.584 --> 01:25.794
I read it.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.713
You didn't know
they were taking donations.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.341
It's a private school. They always
take donations. I'll get them next time.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.135
- What about the owls?
- They'll live.

01:33.218 --> 01:36.513
Apparently they won't, dear.
That's why they need the donations.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.850
- You have a formal coming up?
- Yeah, but I don't think I'm gonna go.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.435
Nonsense. Of course you're going.

01:41.518 --> 01:44.396
Mom, if Rory doesn't wanna go,
she doesn't have to go.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.606
I don't understand
why she wouldn't wanna go.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.066
I know you don't.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.360
I'm gonna go get another Coke.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.406
- What did you say to her?
- What are you talking about?

01:54.448 --> 01:57.242
If she doesn't wanna go,
it's because of something you said.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.786
Mom, I promise.
All I ever said to her about dances...

01:59.870 --> 02:03.331
is that you go, dance, have punch,
eat, you take a picture...

02:03.415 --> 02:06.334
and then you get auctioned off
to a biker gang from Sausalito.

02:06.418 --> 02:10.088
- Lorelai, this is serious.
- Mom, I said nothing, okay?

02:10.255 --> 02:13.216
Rory's disdain of formals
is totally her own.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.469
Let's just drop it, please.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.179
- Fine.
- Fine.

02:20.724 --> 02:24.895
- What's wrong with the tomato?
- It was fraternizing with the enemy.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.567
- Why didn't you mention the dance?
- Because I'm not going.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.487
But why aren't you going?

02:33.695 --> 02:36.239
- Because I hate dances.
- Good answer.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.660
Except you've never
actually been to a dance.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.038
- So?
- So you have nothing to compare it to.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.290
- No, but I can imagine it.
- That's true.

02:45.373 --> 02:48.293
However, not really,
since you've never actually been to one.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.796
You're basing all your dance opinions
on one viewing of Sixteen Candles.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.424
You should have a decent reason
for hating something...

02:54.508 --> 02:56.218
before you really decide you hate it.

02:56.301 --> 03:00.305
Trust me, I'll hate it. It'll be stuffy
and boring, and the music will suck.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.307
Since none of the kids at school like me...

03:02.349 --> 03:04.893
I'll be standing in the back
listening to 98 Degrees...

03:04.976 --> 03:08.438
watching Tristan and Paris argue over
who gets to make me miserable first.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.857
Okay. Or it'll be all sparkly and exciting.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.443
You'll be on the dance floor
listening to Tom Waits...

03:13.527 --> 03:15.946
with some great-looking guy
staring at you so hard...

03:16.029 --> 03:19.115
you don't realize that
Paris and Tristan were just eaten by bears.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.200
What guy?

03:20.283 --> 03:23.286
Maybe the guy who hangs out
in our trees all day waiting for you.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.913
Dean does not hang out in trees.

03:24.996 --> 03:28.041
He bashed his head in a branch
when I came out too quickly.

03:28.124 --> 03:31.336
- Why do you care all of a sudden if I go?
- I don't care if you go.

03:31.378 --> 03:35.215
I just don't want you to miss on
any experience because you're too afraid.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.759
I'm afraid? Of what?

03:37.842 --> 03:40.804
Of asking Dean, of him saying no...

03:40.887 --> 03:44.349
of going to a dance with a bunch of kids
who haven't accepted you yet...

03:44.432 --> 03:45.850
of dancing in public...

03:45.892 --> 03:48.561
of finding out
you should never be dancing in public.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.480
Okay, I get it.

03:50.563 --> 03:54.150
Listen, I know you are not Miss Party Girl,
and I love you for that...

03:54.234 --> 03:56.861
but sometimes I wonder.

03:56.945 --> 04:01.032
Do you not join in
because you really don't want to...

04:01.116 --> 04:03.159
or because you're too shy?

04:03.243 --> 04:06.037
If you don't wanna go
because you really don't wanna go...

04:06.121 --> 04:10.208
and not because you are in any way afraid,
then this is the last time I'll mention it.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.668
I promise.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.546
I don't have a dress.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.841
I could make you one.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.216
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.845
We could get some great shoes,
and some new earrings.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.723
- We could get your hair done.
- You won't think I'm an idiot?

04:24.764 --> 04:26.725
It depends on what hairstyle you choose.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.227
This dance could be great for you.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.074

05:27.619 --> 05:29.120
He's gonna say no.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.706
- Why would he say no?
- Why would he say yes?

05:32.123 --> 05:36.252
There's no point in having a boyfriend
if he won't go to the dance with you.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.670
He's not my boyfriend.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.005
- Really?
- No.

05:39.088 --> 05:42.050
- What is he then?
- He's my gentleman caller.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.635
Okay, Blanche.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.930
I don't know what he is,
but he's not a boyfriend.

05:47.639 --> 05:48.932
Do you think he's my boyfriend?

05:48.973 --> 05:53.102
You guys spend a lot of time not kissing
other people, if it isn't that sort of thing.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.437
- Girlfriend.
- You.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.064
- Boyfriend.
- Him.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.358
No, it sounds weird.

05:58.441 --> 06:02.612
- Have you had the talk yet?
- Yes, Lane. Babies come from the stork.

06:02.654 --> 06:05.114
- The other talk.
- What other talk?

06:05.490 --> 06:08.493
'We've been dating a few weeks now.
Where do we stand?

06:08.576 --> 06:11.079
'If another girl asks you out,
do you feel free to go?'

06:11.162 --> 06:12.956
How do you know so much about this?

06:12.997 --> 06:15.792
Those who can, do.
Those who can't, teach.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.170
There he is.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.840
- I should do this later.
- No. You have to do this now.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.968
- Why?
- Because I have to go home soon...

06:25.009 --> 06:27.887
and my mom threw out our TV
when she caught me watching V.I.P.

06:27.971 --> 06:30.598
So I'm bored,
and I need some entertainment.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.851
- Okay, here I go.
- Good luck.

06:34.143 --> 06:37.480
And remember to enunciate.
I'm reading lips out here.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.488
You're busy.

06:45.571 --> 06:48.741
Yeah, I have to put the new
green bean shipment on the shelves.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.952
- You wanna help?
- Yeah, sure.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.912
I love stacking beans.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.248
Okay, follow me.

06:55.873 --> 06:59.002
- Do you work on Saturdays? I forget.
- It depends.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.546
Sometimes I come in
if I don't have any plans.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.381
- Why?
- No reason.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.051
There's this thing at my school
on Saturday.

07:07.135 --> 07:11.014
It's not really at my school,
but it's kind of given by my school.

07:11.055 --> 07:12.432
What is it?

07:13.641 --> 07:16.769
It's this kind of thing where you go,
and they play music...

07:16.853 --> 07:20.106
and you get dressed up and dance,
and then there's chicken.

07:20.189 --> 07:22.150
- Chicken?
- I don't know if there's chicken.

07:22.233 --> 07:25.570
But at these kinds of things
they often serve chicken...

07:25.653 --> 07:27.864
because it's probably cheaper
and people eat it.

07:27.947 --> 07:31.200
So the logic behind the chicken choice
really isn't that bad.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.286
- I'm lost.
- It's a dance.

07:35.079 --> 07:39.333
It's not like I'm dying to go or anything,
but it is a new school...

07:39.417 --> 07:42.920
and being a part of the social activities
is really important at Chilton.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.840
So are you asking me
to go to a dance with you?

07:45.923 --> 07:46.966
No.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.971
Yes. I mean, if you wanted to go,
I would go, too.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.849
That would probably be good
since it's your school.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.100
Right.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.770
So do you wanna go?

07:58.853 --> 08:00.480
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.026
I've actually never gone to a dance before.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.736
Because they're lame?

08:06.819 --> 08:09.530
Yeah, and it's not the way
I ever wanted to spend my time.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.407
I'm not a big joiner.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.327
Okay, fair enough. More beans, please.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.795
- You wanna go, don't you?
- No, I don't.

08:23.836 --> 08:27.965
I have no desire to go at all.
I was just thinking out loud, that's all.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.677
- So what would I have to wear?
- What?

08:32.178 --> 08:34.889
To this dance. What would I have to wear?

08:34.972 --> 08:36.432
- Anything you want.
- Come on.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.768
Really, whatever
you're comfortable in is fine.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.895
Some sort of pants would be good.

08:40.977 --> 08:42.772
- It's coat and tie.
- Oh, man.

08:42.855 --> 08:46.359
But you could probably get away with
a coat and no tie.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.152
Okay.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.737
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.535
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.397
- Extra thread.
- God bless!

09:24.480 --> 09:26.816
I've been working so hard
to finish Rory's dress...

09:26.899 --> 09:28.234
I haven't been able to get out.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.319
- You are walking funny.
- I know.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.948
Rory's dress made a pass at me,
and I think I pulled something getting up.

09:34.031 --> 09:37.660
Here, sit. I got an ACE Bandage in my bag.

09:37.702 --> 09:41.372
I'm not sure how we can wrap it,
but maybe we can do something creative.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.833
- Sookie.
- Let's see.

09:46.544 --> 09:50.631
Okay, I got Percodan, Vicodin,
Darvocet, and...

09:50.798 --> 09:54.510
Take this one. It's a muscle-relaxer.
Very mild, I promise.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.387
Thanks. Maybe later.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.640
I've gotta go.
You sure you're gonna be okay?

09:59.724 --> 10:01.309
- I'm sure.
- Okay.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.019
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.869
- Yeah.
- You sound terrible.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.079
I'm fine, Mom. I just stubbed my toe.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.623
You should get rid of the clutter
in your living room.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.667
- Maybe.
- That room is a hazard.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.879
I've seen the light. Everything goes.
What else you got?

10:29.920 --> 10:31.881
I wanna talk about Rory's dance.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.425
It's just killing me that she's not going.

10:34.717 --> 10:38.012
This may seem frivolous and silly
to her now, but believe me...

10:38.095 --> 10:41.307
these are the kind of experiences
you regret missing later.

10:41.390 --> 10:42.350
Okay.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.144
Regret can make you bitter.
Do you want Rory to be bitter?

10:45.227 --> 10:46.270
Sort of.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.065
- Lorelai!
- She could make some cash off of it.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.442
Become a crazy
Oscar Levant kind of celebrity...

10:51.525 --> 10:53.194
go on talk shows, heckle Regis.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.321
I wish you would take this seriously.

10:55.404 --> 10:57.365
Mom, Rory is going to the dance.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.658
She is?

11:00.451 --> 11:03.454
That's wonderful! I'm thrilled.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.998
I'm making her dress right now.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.751
- You're making her dress?
- Yeah.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.211
But why?

11:10.294 --> 11:13.756
So she'll look really ugly
and people will point and throw rocks.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.549
Why don't you let me buy her a dress?

11:15.633 --> 11:18.094
Mom, you were thrilled
five seconds ago, remember?

11:18.177 --> 11:20.930
- You're not using the curtains, are you?
- I gotta go.

11:21.013 --> 11:24.475
Just one more thing.
Take a picture of Rory for me, please?

11:24.558 --> 11:26.227
- I will.
- On the stairs.

11:26.310 --> 11:28.312
And one by the front door.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.356
And one as she's getting ready...

11:30.439 --> 11:32.316
putting her hair up,
putting her makeup on.

11:32.399 --> 11:35.611
Okay, do you want one
when she's shaving her legs?

11:35.653 --> 11:37.279
You know, one leg up...

11:37.321 --> 11:39.782
in the tub,
waving the disposable razor in the air?

11:39.824 --> 11:42.159
This is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.496
- You get to be there and I don't.
- Oh, boy!

11:45.579 --> 11:47.581
If I got enough pictures, I could at least...

11:47.665 --> 11:51.168
line them up in chronological order
and pretend I was there.

11:51.544 --> 11:55.005
Maybe bind them together,
make a flipbook out of them.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.509
Would you like to come over on Saturday
and see Rory go to the dance?

11:58.592 --> 12:01.679
Why, what a nice idea. I'd love that.

12:01.762 --> 12:04.098
Thank you. I'll see you at 7:00.

12:13.023 --> 12:14.650
- Hi, Tristan.
- Paris.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.653
- Two, I assume?
- You assume right.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.823
- So, who are you taking?
- Why, are you free?

12:22.700 --> 12:25.995
No, what am I thinking? You wouldn't
be free this close to the dance.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.541
Here's your change.

12:30.624 --> 12:33.961
- Is your hair shorter?
- Yeah. Quarter of an inch.

12:34.169 --> 12:36.213
- Really?
- I got it trimmed.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.299
- It looks good.
- Thanks.

12:41.552 --> 12:45.014
- And she's reading again. How novel.
- Goodbye, Tristan.

12:45.306 --> 12:48.851
- Did you get the novel thing? Because...
- I said goodbye.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.229
- What are you doing here?
- I like lines.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.940
- The guy's supposed to buy the tickets.
- Really?

12:55.024 --> 12:56.775
Does Susan Faludi know about this?

12:56.859 --> 12:59.695
- Unless, of course, there is no guy.
- No, there is a guy.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.906
- A cheap guy.
- What can I say? I like them cheap.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.492
Sloppy, too. Bald spot, beer gut...

13:05.784 --> 13:09.622
and the pants that slip down in the back,
giving you that good plumber shot.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.957
That sends me through the roof.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.751
So, who is he?

13:14.001 --> 13:16.712
How many languages can you say
'none of your business' in?

13:16.795 --> 13:19.715
- Does he go to this school?
- No, he doesn't.

13:21.508 --> 13:25.054
Look, I'll confess something to you.
I don't have a date.

13:25.137 --> 13:28.891
I hear Squeaky Fromme's up for parole
soon. You should keep a good thought.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.893
I actually thought
you'd like to go with me.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.770
- You did not.
- I did, too.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.773
- You did not, because you are not stupid.
- Why, thank you.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.983
Slimy and weaselly, yes. But stupid, no.

13:38.067 --> 13:41.570
You'd have to be stupid to think,
that given our history, I would ever...

13:41.653 --> 13:44.406
barring a piano or a safe
falling on my head...

13:44.490 --> 13:46.909
wanna go anywhere with you. Ever.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.578
Okay, fine. I'll take Cissy.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.581
I'll send her a condolence card.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.251
Yeah. At least she won't be
buying her own ticket.

13:58.796 --> 13:59.922
Two, please.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.715
- Idiot.
- Excuse me?

14:01.799 --> 14:04.218
He was totally nice to you
and you were a big jerk.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.512
If you like Tristan so much,
you go out with him.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.639
- I don't have enough change.
- Pay me later.

14:08.722 --> 14:11.767
What am I, your Versateller?
Wait for change.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.602
I need change! Now!

14:15.145 --> 14:17.481
You can't be going
with someone better than Tristan.

14:17.564 --> 14:19.983
- Whatever.
- You probably don't even have a date.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.070
You're probably going to
come down with some rare form of flu...

14:23.153 --> 14:25.280
that only hits losers on dance night.

14:25.322 --> 14:29.076
You know what? I don't want my change.
Money makes people shallow.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.454
I've got your change!

14:33.956 --> 14:37.084
If you think I'm keeping this dollar,
I'm not!

14:37.167 --> 14:39.086
- I'll take it.
- Shut up.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.798
- Come on, already!
- I'm primping.

14:43.841 --> 14:47.761
You're 16, you have skin like a baby's ass.
There's nothing to primp.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.555
Okay, here I come.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.935
Someone hit you with a pretty stick.

14:55.018 --> 14:57.521
This dress is amazing. You outdid yourself.

14:57.604 --> 14:59.982
It's beautiful, baby. You look beautiful.

15:00.023 --> 15:01.316
- Come here.
- What?

15:01.358 --> 15:03.360
- Stray hair.
- Fix, please.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.491
I think my favorite part is the shoes.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.285
- The heels hurt.
- Beauty is pain.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.078
I'll just throw them on on my way out.

15:13.161 --> 15:15.831
You should put them on now
and let your feet get numb.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.584
- That's sick.
- Go get me the hair spray.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.712
- It's open!
- It's me!

15:23.213 --> 15:24.381
I got tacos.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.635
I got extra hot sauce
and a couple of extra burritos...

15:28.719 --> 15:32.014
- to put in the fridge for later.
- You take such good care of me.

15:32.055 --> 15:33.557
Sookie, look.

15:34.516 --> 15:38.812
Oh, my God! You're a movie star!
I'm serious.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.857
At some point tonight,
walk down a flight of stairs.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.692
Movie stars always walk down staircases.

15:43.775 --> 15:46.320
Let me spray while you try to figure out
what she said.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.363
You don't move. I got it.

15:51.199 --> 15:53.660
- Wrong way. I got it.
- Are you okay?

15:53.744 --> 15:56.246
Yeah, sweetie. Hand that to your mother.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.624
My eyelashes are all stuck together.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.918
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.669
Shield the tacos.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.547
Okay, ready?

16:07.591 --> 16:08.717
God!

16:09.968 --> 16:13.305
That'll be good for six slow dances,
four medium ones, one lambada...

16:13.388 --> 16:16.058
but if you wanna do any moshing,
I suggest another coat.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.809
No, I think I'm good.

16:17.893 --> 16:22.189
Rory, sweetie, is this soap
by the sink in the silver bottle?

16:22.272 --> 16:23.315
No.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.567
Go in there, quick.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.694
We're in here!

16:30.489 --> 16:33.408
'We're in here'?
That's how you answer the door?

16:33.450 --> 16:37.371
- I was all out of Saran wrap.
- I don't want to figure that one out.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.915
- Where is my granddaughter?
- Kitchen.

16:39.998 --> 16:43.251
Perfect. I wanna be all ready
for the big entrance.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.379
How's the light in here? Never mind.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.547
I'll take one with the flash
and one without...

16:47.631 --> 16:49.174
to make sure we've got it right.

16:49.257 --> 16:50.676
Wow, Mom, look at you.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.929
You'd think Anne Taylor was having
a sale or something.

16:53.970 --> 16:56.431
Okay, Rory, come in here, please.

16:58.725 --> 17:00.185
Hey, Grandma.

17:01.436 --> 17:04.731
- She has lived with you too long.
- Lose the bib and the taco...

17:04.815 --> 17:08.734
put your shoes on and come back out.
Let Grandma take the pretty picture.

17:12.571 --> 17:14.991
- I'm gonna get going.
- You are not driving.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.367
I walked.

17:16.617 --> 17:20.372
It's nice to see you again, Mrs. Gilmore,
or at least make out your shape.

17:20.454 --> 17:22.915
Call me in 15 minutes,
or I'll send out a search party.

17:22.999 --> 17:26.711
You call me if I need to come over
and help you up the stairs.

17:26.795 --> 17:29.131
- No, I'll be fine.
- Bye.

17:29.673 --> 17:32.134
- Why would you need help up the stairs?
- No reason.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.219
Rory, let's go. Your public awaits!

17:34.302 --> 17:36.888
- Why aren't you moving?
- I'm comfortable, that's all.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.766
- Are you hurt?
- I have a little back spasm. That's it.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.059
It's no big deal.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.563
- What sort of back spasm?
- I don't know, Mom. Just a normal one.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.690
There is nothing normal
about a back spasm.

17:46.773 --> 17:49.818
The fact that it has the word 'spasm' in it
means it's not normal.

17:49.901 --> 17:52.279
- Here she is. Get your camera moving.
- What?

17:52.362 --> 17:55.866
Oh, my! You're gorgeous. Smile.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.745
I'm so glad you decided to buy her a dress.

18:01.079 --> 18:03.039
- That's Dean.
- Come here.

18:04.916 --> 18:06.543
Have an amazing time.

18:06.626 --> 18:10.463
I'll chronicle the whole evening for you,
I promise. Bye, Grandma.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.966
- Where are you going?
- To the dance.

18:13.049 --> 18:15.510
You do not go running out the door
when a boy honks.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.430
- Mom, it's fine.
- It certainly is not fine.

18:18.513 --> 18:21.224
This is not a drive-through.
She's not fried chicken.

18:21.308 --> 18:24.186
But I told him to honk
and I'd meet him out there. We agreed.

18:24.227 --> 18:25.729
I don't care what you told him.

18:25.770 --> 18:28.690
If he wants to take you out,
he will walk up to this door...

18:28.732 --> 18:31.985
knock, and say, 'Good evening,'
and come inside for a moment...

18:32.068 --> 18:34.237
like any civilized human being
would know to do.

18:34.321 --> 18:37.449
- This is silly. I have met him already.
- I haven't.

18:37.532 --> 18:41.286
- Yeah, but...
- We will wait until he comes to the door.

18:41.703 --> 18:45.040
- He doesn't know he's supposed to.
- He'll figure it out.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.939
- He's not a very bright boy, is he?
- Mom, please.

19:13.109 --> 19:15.445
Don't rush. A lady never rushes.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.493
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:21.576 --> 19:24.746
- I thought I was supposed to honk.
- I know. I'm sorry.

19:24.788 --> 19:27.248
Young man, come in here, please.

19:32.796 --> 19:35.799
Hey, Dean. Meet my mother, Emily Post.

19:38.259 --> 19:39.928
- Hi.
- Hello.

19:40.011 --> 19:42.514
Great rap session.
You guys are out of here. Have fun.

19:42.597 --> 19:44.933
- Be home by 11:00.
- 12:00.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.936
- Bye, Grandma. Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

19:50.563 --> 19:54.275
- What do you know about this boy?
- I know that Rory likes him...

19:54.359 --> 19:57.904
and that his parole officer has high hopes
for his rehabilitation.

19:57.987 --> 19:59.781
- Does he drink?
- Like a fish.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.909
- That's not a crazy question.
- It is a crazy question...

20:02.992 --> 20:06.705
because if I knew he was a drinker,
he would not be with Rory now.

20:06.788 --> 20:09.040
- Yes, but...
- Mom, please relax.

20:09.249 --> 20:12.460
Dean is a good kid.
Rory's gonna have a great time.

20:12.502 --> 20:13.670
You got your pictures.

20:13.753 --> 20:16.297
Tomorrow I will call you
and give you all the details.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.341
- What are you going to do?
- What do you mean?

20:18.425 --> 20:20.635
- You certainly can't be left alone.
- Yes, I can.

20:20.718 --> 20:23.388
You can't move.
You've been sitting there since I arrived.

20:23.471 --> 20:25.932
That's because this is a right comfy couch.

20:26.015 --> 20:29.018
- Maybe I should stay.
- No, you really don't have to do that.

20:29.060 --> 20:31.646
I'm not leaving my daughter
stranded on the couch.

20:31.729 --> 20:34.607
- What if you need to get to the bathroom?
- I don't go anymore.

20:34.691 --> 20:35.984
I gave it up cold turkey.

20:36.067 --> 20:37.944
- I'm staying.
- No, Mom.

20:38.611 --> 20:41.656
Look, I can stand, okay?

20:43.741 --> 20:44.826
See?

20:45.952 --> 20:49.289
I'm up. Okay, see? I'm fine.

20:50.248 --> 20:51.875
- Move.
- What?

20:52.876 --> 20:55.378
Move. If you're fine, then move.

20:55.962 --> 20:57.380
I can move.

20:59.382 --> 21:01.092
This is me moving.

21:01.968 --> 21:04.596
Any second now, the moving will begin.

21:04.929 --> 21:06.055
Rats.

21:06.806 --> 21:08.516
I'll go start some tea.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.811
Please tell me
you have something besides Lipton.

21:12.562 --> 21:15.356
A stroke would be so good
right about now.

21:21.863 --> 21:24.324
Maybe we should just forget about this.

21:24.407 --> 21:25.533
Okay.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.369
I mean, it's just a dance.
What's the big deal?

21:28.411 --> 21:29.537
Beats me.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.123
And these kids at my school... Awful.

21:32.248 --> 21:34.709
- Have you seen The Outsiders?
- Yeah, I have.

21:34.792 --> 21:36.586
Just call me Ponyboy.

21:37.587 --> 21:41.090
I heard this place is beautiful, though.
Old and historic.

21:41.966 --> 21:44.219
Maybe we could just go in for a minute.

21:44.260 --> 21:45.720
- Fine.
- Or not.

21:45.803 --> 21:47.180
Fine, too.

21:47.263 --> 21:49.974
I don't know. Why can't I decide?

21:50.058 --> 21:52.769
This is stupid. What do you think?

21:53.186 --> 21:55.813
I think that you look amazing tonight.

21:58.107 --> 22:00.777
Maybe just a couple of minutes won't hurt.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.030
Yes, Marta.

22:04.113 --> 22:07.533
Just make sure everything's locked up
before you leave.

22:07.951 --> 22:10.078
No, I won't be home tonight.

22:11.079 --> 22:13.623
- Was that a pain?
- Yes, a big one.

22:14.999 --> 22:17.585
All right, that's it. Bye.

22:17.794 --> 22:21.422
So, Mom, you really don't have to do this.

22:21.798 --> 22:25.593
Don't be silly. I couldn't possibly
leave you alone like this.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.095
What are you doing, Mom?

22:27.136 --> 22:29.597
I'm trying to find the candlesticks
I bought you.

22:29.639 --> 22:31.307
What candlesticks?

22:31.474 --> 22:35.186
The Baccarat candlesticks
I bought you last year for Christmas.

22:35.269 --> 22:38.731
I assume that you stuffed them
in the back of the closet somewhere.

22:38.815 --> 22:41.567
No, I did not stuff them
in the back of the closet.

22:41.651 --> 22:44.278
Then where are they? I don't see them out.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.823
See, we didn't actually...

22:46.906 --> 22:50.326
have a big use for the crystal candlesticks.

22:50.410 --> 22:51.994
So I kind of...

22:54.747 --> 22:56.249
exchanged them.

22:56.499 --> 22:58.459
- For what?
- A monkey lamp.

22:58.793 --> 23:02.130
- Pardon me?
- It's a lamp with a bunch of monkeys on it.

23:02.755 --> 23:05.258
Baccarat crystal candlesticks
for a monkey lamp?

23:05.341 --> 23:07.552
They're really happy monkeys, Mom.

23:07.635 --> 23:09.595
Where is this lamp? I want to see it.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.889
It's right there on the desk.

23:15.518 --> 23:17.979
Oh, my God!
They're holding coconuts and leering.

23:18.062 --> 23:19.188
It's funny.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.648
You traded my lovely gift...

23:20.732 --> 23:24.485
for a semi-pornographic,
leering monkey lamp? How could you?

23:24.569 --> 23:27.238
This is not just about returning a gift.

23:27.321 --> 23:29.741
This goes to the very heart
of the question of taste.

23:29.824 --> 23:33.661
You were given something of substance,
and you cast it off for a ridiculous...

23:33.703 --> 23:36.330
slightly sinister barroom decoration?

23:37.039 --> 23:38.875
Explain this to me, Lorelai.

23:39.792 --> 23:41.294
My back hurts.

23:57.894 --> 24:00.646
- It's a very good room.
- Looks historical.

24:00.730 --> 24:03.232
I commend the person
who suggested this location.

24:03.316 --> 24:06.527
So, we could just get our picture taken
and leave.

24:06.777 --> 24:07.862
We could.

24:07.945 --> 24:11.282
- Or we could dance a little first.
- Yeah?

24:11.365 --> 24:13.701
- I stress 'a little. '
- Something slow.

24:13.784 --> 24:15.411
That sounds good.

24:17.455 --> 24:19.665
- Can we go yet?
- We haven't even eaten dinner.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.084
- I'm bored.
- We have to wait for Paris anyway.

24:22.168 --> 24:24.170
Fine. Give me your roll.

24:27.173 --> 24:28.799
- What?
- Rory Gilmore.

24:28.883 --> 24:30.593
God, she's got good hair.

24:30.676 --> 24:32.428
- Who's the dish?
- Beats me.

24:32.511 --> 24:35.223
He's not from the manor born,
that's for sure.

24:35.264 --> 24:36.515
Let's go.

24:39.936 --> 24:42.396
So, should we dance
or should we sit first?

24:42.438 --> 24:44.190
Rory, you came.

24:44.273 --> 24:46.067
Great dress. Who's it by?

24:46.150 --> 24:48.402
- Lorelai Gilmore.
- You made it yourself?

24:48.444 --> 24:50.821
- No, my mom made it for me.
- She did, really?

24:51.447 --> 24:53.658
So, you're traveling
with a bodyguard now?

24:53.741 --> 24:56.577
No, this is my... This is Dean.

24:56.911 --> 24:59.413
- Dean, this is Louise and Madeline.
- Hi.

24:59.497 --> 25:02.750
- My mom can't make anything.
- How tall are you?

25:03.417 --> 25:06.712
- Soup, she can make soup.
- You know, my whole family is really tall.

25:06.796 --> 25:10.216
I mean, the men mostly.
What are you, 6'1", 6'2"?

25:10.299 --> 25:12.385
Does he get a prize if he guesses?

25:12.468 --> 25:15.263
One kind of soup, actually.
It's green, lumpy.

25:15.304 --> 25:18.099
- I'm 6'2".
- Actually, she can't make soup either.

25:18.182 --> 25:20.393
- 6'2" is a good height.
- You think?

25:20.476 --> 25:21.686
I think.

25:24.939 --> 25:26.399
What do you think? Too tall?

25:26.482 --> 25:27.692
- Not in heels.
- Good.

25:27.775 --> 25:30.152
Although, the saddle shoes
make it kind of difficult.

25:30.236 --> 25:32.446
- I'll just have to stoop then.
- I guess so.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.240
Okay, I'm bored.

25:37.118 --> 25:38.953
- I like your dress.
- Thanks.

25:42.415 --> 25:44.041
Hey, you're nice.

25:46.544 --> 25:48.295
- Slow song.
- Let's go.

25:54.135 --> 25:56.595
- I see you came.
- You sold me the ticket.

25:56.679 --> 25:58.014
I'm Jacob.

25:58.097 --> 26:00.433
- Hi, I'm Rory. This is Dean.
- Hi.

26:01.225 --> 26:02.560
Excuse us.

26:03.519 --> 26:05.396
Those are not friends.

26:05.521 --> 26:07.940
- I was being polite.
- Well, don't.

26:09.817 --> 26:12.361
- So, that's Paris?
- Yes, it is.

26:12.653 --> 26:15.114
- She seems fun.
- Yeah, she is.

26:15.197 --> 26:18.993
Okay, this dancing thing is not something
I want you to get used to...

26:19.076 --> 26:20.244
or comment on.

26:20.327 --> 26:22.288
Now, that goes both ways.

26:27.251 --> 26:30.296
If I kiss you, is a nun gonna come out
and boot me out of here?

26:30.379 --> 26:32.006
It's not a Catholic school.

26:32.089 --> 26:34.925
- So I can kiss you?
- Yeah, you can kiss me.

26:44.894 --> 26:47.688
- Okay, I'm perfect now.
- Great.

26:47.813 --> 26:49.690
- You want to dance?
- Nope.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.567
- You want to eat?
- Nope.

26:51.650 --> 26:53.611
You want to go make out?

26:54.820 --> 26:56.822
Yeah, all right, let's go.

27:00.910 --> 27:03.329
So, Ponyboy, you happy?

27:04.163 --> 27:05.748
Yeah, I'm happy.

27:09.502 --> 27:10.961
There you go.

27:11.045 --> 27:13.339
Mom, I think somebody already ate that.

27:13.422 --> 27:15.591
- That is a mashed banana on toast.
- Okay.

27:15.674 --> 27:18.385
I used to make this for you
when you were a little girl.

27:18.469 --> 27:21.055
- You did?
- Whenever you got sick, I made this.

27:21.096 --> 27:22.765
Wasn't it the other way around?

27:22.848 --> 27:25.100
- You don't want it?
- No, I want it.

27:25.184 --> 27:27.561
- I'll just take it back.
- Mom, I said I want it.

27:27.603 --> 27:29.855
Are you sure?
Because I could throw it away.

27:29.939 --> 27:32.149
Relinquish the banana, please.

27:34.401 --> 27:36.862
You can't possibly be comfortable
like that.

27:36.946 --> 27:39.532
Mother, please,
this is the first position in 24 hours...

27:39.615 --> 27:42.284
- that has not made me crazy.
- All right.

27:43.452 --> 27:45.079
You're not eating.

27:48.958 --> 27:53.545
- Mom, please don't make me eat this.
- You have to eat something.

27:53.629 --> 27:56.090
Sookie left me a burrito in the fridge.

27:56.173 --> 27:59.093
- I'll go warm it up for you.
- I can eat it cold.

28:00.261 --> 28:02.221
Fine, I'll just go get it then.

28:02.513 --> 28:04.306
Hot's better, though.

28:04.807 --> 28:06.517
I'll be right back.

28:19.989 --> 28:23.033
Okay, I need something to drink.
You want some punch?

28:23.117 --> 28:24.201
Sure.

28:26.287 --> 28:28.747
- Hi. Rory, right?
- Yes.

28:29.540 --> 28:32.876
- Jacob. We met earlier with Paris.
- Yes, I remember.

28:33.502 --> 28:36.588
- Are you having a good time?
- Actually, I am. You?

28:37.131 --> 28:38.465
It's okay.

28:39.508 --> 28:41.969
So, was that your boyfriend?

28:42.845 --> 28:45.931
- I don't know. I'm not sure.
- You're not sure?

28:46.015 --> 28:48.142
We've only been going out
for a little while...

28:48.225 --> 28:50.477
So there's still a little room to play?

28:50.561 --> 28:52.980
- What?
- Would you like to dance?

28:53.564 --> 28:54.982
No, thanks.

28:55.065 --> 28:57.067
Maybe I could get your number?

28:57.151 --> 28:59.278
- What for?
- To call you.

29:00.696 --> 29:03.032
I'm sorry, aren't you here with Paris?

29:04.742 --> 29:08.746
So maybe you shouldn't be over here
asking me for my number then.

29:09.204 --> 29:11.498
Why? Paris is my cousin.

29:11.999 --> 29:13.834
- Your cousin?
- Yeah.

29:14.460 --> 29:17.671
- Paris is your cousin? You're related?
- Yeah.

29:18.505 --> 29:22.926
Jacob, it's been very nice to meet you.
I hope you have a lovely evening.

29:26.388 --> 29:28.182
Look, Barbara Stanwyck.

29:28.265 --> 29:31.602
- I just love Barbara Stanwyck.
- Yeah, she's good.

29:31.894 --> 29:35.147
She had that wonderful voice,
that husky, deep voice.

29:35.230 --> 29:37.107
I just love that voice.

29:38.525 --> 29:42.154
You know, Mom, you have
kind of a Barbara Stanwycky voice.

29:42.613 --> 29:44.406
- I do not.
- I mean it.

29:44.573 --> 29:48.702
You could've gotten Fred MacMurray
to off Dad if you'd really wanted to.

29:48.786 --> 29:51.288
You do enjoy teasing me, don't you?

29:51.538 --> 29:53.373
You know, I really do.

29:54.833 --> 29:57.836
- Rory looked so lovely tonight.
- She did, didn't she?

29:57.920 --> 30:01.715
I can't get over how she's grown into
that little woman who walked out of here.

30:01.757 --> 30:02.925
I know.

30:04.384 --> 30:06.011
You know what, Mom?

30:06.970 --> 30:08.597
I made the dress.

30:10.057 --> 30:12.768
- You did a lovely job.
- Thank you.

30:14.269 --> 30:16.021
With Rory and the dress.

30:17.022 --> 30:18.398
Thank you.

30:22.569 --> 30:24.905
Let me get this out of your way.

30:24.988 --> 30:27.574
You really don't remember me
making this for you?

30:27.658 --> 30:30.869
- I don't, I'm sorry.
- I did, and you loved it.

30:31.787 --> 30:34.998
- You know what? Let me give it a try.
- All right.

30:43.632 --> 30:44.716
Yes?

30:44.967 --> 30:47.886
It's even more disgusting
than I thought it was gonna be.

30:47.970 --> 30:49.263
It is not.

30:53.892 --> 30:57.646
Oh, my God, it's horrible!
What on earth was I thinking?

31:00.065 --> 31:02.734
So, you wanna maybe go?

31:03.026 --> 31:05.404
You're bored? I'm sorry.
Let's go, right away.

31:05.487 --> 31:08.365
I'm not bored.
I thought there's still a little time left.

31:08.448 --> 31:11.201
Maybe we could
get a cup of coffee somewhere...

31:11.285 --> 31:14.246
hang out a little, take a walk.
You know, just us.

31:14.329 --> 31:15.789
That'd be nice.

31:15.872 --> 31:18.292
No, you stay. I'll get the coats.

31:20.002 --> 31:22.087
So how many people have you told?

31:22.170 --> 31:25.215
- Four? Five? Everybody?
- What are you talking about?

31:25.299 --> 31:26.925
You know that Jacob is my cousin.

31:27.009 --> 31:30.554
Now you have all the ammunition
you needed to pay me back, right?

31:30.637 --> 31:32.597
I don't wanna pay you back,
I wanna get away.

31:32.681 --> 31:35.017
Now you can go all over school
telling everyone...

31:35.100 --> 31:38.478
that Paris Geller couldn't get a date
to the dance. That she had no one.

31:38.562 --> 31:42.107
Since she couldn't just not come,
she had to ask her cousin to take her.

31:42.190 --> 31:44.401
She had to give him gas money
to make him do it.

31:44.484 --> 31:46.236
Go ahead, tell them!

31:46.528 --> 31:48.780
I don't have to. You just did.

32:02.377 --> 32:04.504
- We haven't met.
- No, we haven't.

32:04.588 --> 32:07.090
- I'm Tristan.
- Yes, we have.

32:07.340 --> 32:09.676
- What are you talking about?
- Rory's mentioned you.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.846
- Yeah?
- I wouldn't get quite so excited about it.

32:12.929 --> 32:15.932
- Why, did she say something mean?
- She said you're a jackass.

32:16.016 --> 32:17.642
- Really?
- Actually, no.

32:17.726 --> 32:20.479
Rory doesn't use words like that.
I embellished a little.

32:20.562 --> 32:22.731
So you're the big, strong protector?

32:22.814 --> 32:24.775
Little princess needs a protector.

32:24.858 --> 32:26.401
- What's your problem, man?
- Nothing.

32:26.485 --> 32:28.487
- I just don't like your girlfriend.
- Really?

32:28.570 --> 32:32.199
- It doesn't look that way to me.
- I don't care how it looks to you.

32:32.240 --> 32:35.202
You got in my path,
not the other way around.

32:35.619 --> 32:38.163
- You're kidding, right?
- Why, are you going somewhere?

32:38.246 --> 32:40.957
- Get out of my way, Dristan.
- Aren't you clever?

32:41.041 --> 32:42.709
What's going on?

32:42.751 --> 32:45.003
Nothing. Just getting to know
your boyfriend.

32:45.087 --> 32:47.339
- It's going real well, don't you think?
- Yeah.

32:47.422 --> 32:49.466
We're just about to build a clubhouse.

32:49.549 --> 32:52.094
I hate to break up the party,
but we should go.

32:52.177 --> 32:54.679
- Why? Little girl's got to be home?
- Stop!

32:54.763 --> 32:56.973
No, I think you two
make a very cute couple.

32:57.057 --> 33:00.936
Is your horse and buggy parked outside?
Gotta get home for the barn raising?

33:01.019 --> 33:02.270
Let's go.

33:03.438 --> 33:06.900
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- You will not push me again!

33:06.983 --> 33:10.570
Are you seriously trying to act tough?
You're wearing a tie, for God's sake!

33:10.654 --> 33:11.863
Outside, now.

33:11.947 --> 33:16.618
No, it'd be like fighting an accountant.
I'll call you when I need my taxes done.

33:20.080 --> 33:22.249
- You don't want to fight me, Tristan!
- Why not?

33:22.332 --> 33:24.459
'Cause I'll kill you, idiot!

33:25.627 --> 33:27.128
Come on, Rory.

33:30.006 --> 33:32.926
You will not come near her ever again.

33:37.931 --> 33:39.766
- That was good.
- Whatever.

33:41.726 --> 33:43.186
Are you okay?

33:45.855 --> 33:48.275
Did you really bring your cousin?

34:05.667 --> 34:08.085
- What are you doing?
- Go to sleep.

34:08.210 --> 34:11.422
- The movie's not over.
- I'll tell you how it ends.

34:28.398 --> 34:30.025
Thank you, Mommy.

34:39.409 --> 34:40.827
That was quite a dance.

34:40.869 --> 34:43.121
I seriously don't know what got into him.

34:43.204 --> 34:44.581
- I do.
- What?

34:45.081 --> 34:46.458
He has a thing for you.

34:46.498 --> 34:49.335
No, he doesn't.
It's just a game to him or something.

34:49.377 --> 34:51.087
He has a thing for you.

34:51.170 --> 34:54.466
He does nothing but insult me
and make me miserable.

34:54.632 --> 34:56.509
He has a thing for you.

34:58.219 --> 35:00.513
I don't know how I feel
about this whole situation.

35:00.555 --> 35:02.515
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

35:02.599 --> 35:06.019
Having my boyfriend defend my honor.
It's weird.

35:06.728 --> 35:08.021
Boyfriend?

35:08.104 --> 35:10.231
- What?
- You said 'boyfriend. '

35:10.648 --> 35:12.734
No, I just meant boyfriend...

35:12.817 --> 35:16.196
in the sense that the defending-me thing
was very boyfriendy...

35:16.237 --> 35:18.239
but only in the broadest sense
of the word...

35:18.323 --> 35:20.909
which doesn't even apply at all here.

35:21.242 --> 35:23.286
You are seriously babbling.

35:23.370 --> 35:26.289
- I didn't mean that you were my boyfriend.
- Okay.

35:26.498 --> 35:29.667
- I don't think you're my boyfriend.
- Okay.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.049
- What?
- Are you my boyfriend?

35:36.633 --> 35:39.385
In the 'broadest sense of the word' way?

35:39.761 --> 35:41.054
No, in the real...

35:41.137 --> 35:44.057
'Hi, this is Dean, my boyfriend,'
kind of way.

35:44.140 --> 35:46.518
Well, I am if you want me to be.

35:46.976 --> 35:48.061
I do.

35:49.938 --> 35:51.064
Okay.

35:51.106 --> 35:52.690
- So it's settled.
- Yes, it is.

35:52.774 --> 35:55.485
- You're my boyfriend.
- That's the consensus.

35:59.656 --> 36:02.492
I'm feeling pretty good about this decision.

36:02.575 --> 36:04.828
Well, I'm very glad to hear it.

36:06.246 --> 36:08.373
I guess Miss Patty forgot to lock up.

36:08.456 --> 36:11.126
I've never really seen in here before.

36:12.210 --> 36:14.838
- Are all these women really Miss Patty?
- Yeah.

36:15.839 --> 36:18.174
She said she's done everything
in show business...

36:18.258 --> 36:21.010
except set fire to the hoop
the dog jumps through.

36:21.094 --> 36:22.470
I'll get it.

36:25.306 --> 36:27.892
God, this weighs a ton.
What do you have in here?

36:27.976 --> 36:29.060
I don't know.

36:29.143 --> 36:32.730
A lipstick, $5 bill, gum, hair spray, a book.

36:33.189 --> 36:34.732
- A book?
- Yeah.

36:34.816 --> 36:36.609
- You brought a book to the dance?
- Yeah.

36:36.693 --> 36:39.112
You thought there'd be a lot of downtime?

36:39.195 --> 36:42.907
No. I just take a book with me everywhere.
It's just habit.

36:43.658 --> 36:46.953
- So, what are you reading?
- The Portable Dorothy Parker.

36:51.165 --> 36:55.169
'There's little in taking or giving
There's little in water or wine

36:55.253 --> 36:59.424
'This living, this living, this living
Was never a project of mine'

37:03.303 --> 37:05.221
- Cheery.
- Funny, though.

37:07.015 --> 37:08.433
- Hey.
- What?

37:09.017 --> 37:12.562
- Thank you for tonight. It was perfect.
- You're welcome.

37:39.047 --> 37:41.507
Okay, ladies, grab your yoga mats.

37:46.304 --> 37:49.057
Oh, my goodness, it's Lorelai's girl!

37:49.349 --> 37:52.477
- Patty, Rory Gilmore is here.
- What?

37:52.560 --> 37:55.897
She's over here,
asleep with the bag boy from the market.

37:55.980 --> 37:57.857
What are we supposed to do?

37:57.940 --> 38:00.568
Rory, honey, it's Miss Patty.

38:01.986 --> 38:05.239
Rory? What are you doing here?

38:05.573 --> 38:06.866
Miss Patty?

38:06.908 --> 38:08.993
Yes. Have you been here all night?

38:09.077 --> 38:11.287
Oh, no. Dean, wake up.

38:11.371 --> 38:14.207
- What time is it?
- It's 5:30 in the morning.

38:14.290 --> 38:17.502
Oh, my God, we fell asleep.
How could we have fallen asleep?

38:17.585 --> 38:19.712
Calm down, I'll explain it to your mom.

38:19.754 --> 38:22.340
- Where's my purse?
- I got it. Relax.

38:22.632 --> 38:24.133
I have to go.

38:27.595 --> 38:29.555
- Wait up!
- I have to go!

38:29.597 --> 38:31.849
I'm going with you.
We'll explain. It'll be okay.

38:31.891 --> 38:34.685
You can't come.
You shouldn't be near my house right now.

38:34.727 --> 38:37.397
- It's not our fault.
- I know. I just have to get home.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.482
- Please let me come with you.
- No!

38:39.732 --> 38:41.401
I have to go home.

38:47.615 --> 38:50.952
- Lorelai, get up. Right now!
- What?

38:51.035 --> 38:52.620
Rory's not home.

38:53.746 --> 38:54.872
Rory's what?

38:54.914 --> 38:57.041
I sat all night. I dozed off for one second.

38:57.125 --> 39:00.086
The next thing I know,
it's 5:30 and she's not here.

39:02.213 --> 39:05.091
She's not there. Aren't you listening?

39:08.636 --> 39:10.930
Where's the phone? Call the police.

39:12.140 --> 39:14.642
What are you doing? Call the police!

39:14.725 --> 39:16.519
- Mom, stop it!
- What are you doing?

39:16.602 --> 39:18.521
I'm looking for the phone!

39:18.604 --> 39:20.481
Why don't you ever clean up around here?

39:20.565 --> 39:23.693
You can't find the phone
in an emergency. What if there was a fire?

39:23.776 --> 39:25.361
What if Rory was choking?

39:25.444 --> 39:27.864
- Mom, stop yelling.
- Rory is missing!

39:27.947 --> 39:31.075
I know that,
and your yelling is not helping me.

39:43.754 --> 39:44.922
What?

39:47.800 --> 39:48.926
Okay.

39:50.845 --> 39:52.096
Thanks.

39:52.722 --> 39:56.392
No, thank you so much. Okay, bye-bye.

39:57.852 --> 40:00.104
- Rory's okay.
- Where is she? What happened?

40:00.146 --> 40:02.607
She and Dean were at Miss Patty's.

40:03.691 --> 40:05.568
What is that, a motel?

40:05.651 --> 40:10.197
It's a dance studio. That was Patty.
She said that she found them asleep...

40:10.281 --> 40:12.491
and woke them up,
and Rory's on her way home.

40:12.533 --> 40:15.453
- And what state were they found in?
- She didn't say, okay?

40:15.536 --> 40:17.705
Let's be calm
until we know what happened.

40:17.788 --> 40:20.166
What do you mean?
We know what happened.

40:20.207 --> 40:22.835
- No, we don't.
- They were out all night!

40:22.919 --> 40:25.004
I'm gonna make some coffee.

40:26.005 --> 40:29.175
Lorelai, I've watched you
do a lot of stupid things in your life...

40:29.258 --> 40:31.761
- and I have held my tongue.
- You've what?

40:31.844 --> 40:35.681
But I will not stand by
and let you allow that girl to ruin her life.

40:36.891 --> 40:38.142
Back off.

40:38.184 --> 40:40.019
She spent the night out with that boy...

40:40.061 --> 40:42.146
the one you let her
run off to that dance with.

40:42.229 --> 40:44.607
So help me God,
I will not get into this with you.

40:44.690 --> 40:46.984
- She's doing the same thing you did.
- No, she's not.

40:47.026 --> 40:49.070
- She'll get pregnant.
- No, she's not.

40:49.153 --> 40:51.322
She's gonna ruin everything,
just like you did.

40:51.405 --> 40:54.367
No, she's not!

40:54.784 --> 40:57.161
Rory is a good kid, Mom! She's not me!

40:57.203 --> 40:59.330
What kind of mother are you to allow this?

40:59.413 --> 41:01.832
I don't know.
What kind of mother were you?

41:01.874 --> 41:04.794
You're gonna lose her just like I lost you.

41:04.877 --> 41:06.837
I am not gonna lose her. Do you hear me?

41:06.921 --> 41:09.674
Even if I hadn't gotten pregnant,
you'd still have lost me.

41:09.757 --> 41:12.968
I had nothing in that house.
I had no life, no air.

41:13.052 --> 41:16.222
You strangled me. I do not strangle Rory.

41:16.263 --> 41:19.225
You're so perfect, and I was so horrible.

41:19.308 --> 41:23.020
I put you in good schools.
I gave you the best of everything.

41:23.062 --> 41:25.189
I made sure
you had the finest opportunities.

41:25.231 --> 41:27.066
And I am so tired of hearing about...

41:27.149 --> 41:30.069
how you were suffocated
and I was so controlling.

41:30.152 --> 41:31.654
If I was so controlling...

41:31.737 --> 41:35.157
why couldn't I control you getting
pregnant and throwing your life away?

41:35.241 --> 41:36.742
- Get out.
- What?

41:36.826 --> 41:40.830
You will not come into my house
and tell me I threw my life away.

41:40.913 --> 41:42.832
Look around, Mom. This is a life.

41:42.915 --> 41:45.626
It has a little color,
so it may look unfamiliar to you.

41:45.709 --> 41:47.002
But it's a life.

41:47.086 --> 41:49.547
If I hadn't gotten pregnant,
I wouldn't have Rory.

41:49.630 --> 41:50.965
That's not what I meant.

41:51.048 --> 41:54.427
Maybe I was some horrible,
uncontrollable child like you say...

41:54.510 --> 41:55.845
but Rory isn't.

41:55.928 --> 41:59.348
She's smart and careful, and I trust her.
She's gonna be fine.

41:59.432 --> 42:03.811
If you can't accept or believe that,
then I don't want you in this house!

42:19.034 --> 42:20.953
Mom, thank you for saying all those...

42:21.036 --> 42:24.331
What were you thinking,
staying out all night? Are you insane?

42:24.415 --> 42:26.542
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

42:26.625 --> 42:29.962
You're talking to the queen of staying out.
I invented the concept.

42:30.004 --> 42:32.631
This is no accident!
You can't do this. Period!

42:32.715 --> 42:33.799
Nothing happened.

42:33.883 --> 42:37.428
Do you have any idea what it's like
to wake up with my mother here...

42:37.511 --> 42:39.555
and find out that you never came home?

42:39.638 --> 42:41.473
So all this is about Grandma being here?

42:41.557 --> 42:43.726
No, it's about
the feeling of complete terror...

42:43.809 --> 42:46.103
- when you're not in bed in the morning.
- Sorry.

42:46.145 --> 42:48.522
It's a different kind of terror
when I find out...

42:48.606 --> 42:52.651
- that you spent the night with some guy!
- I didn't spend the night. We fell asleep.

42:52.735 --> 42:55.529
You are going on the pill.
You are not getting pregnant!

42:55.613 --> 42:57.364
I'm not sleeping with Dean!

42:57.448 --> 42:59.825
What happened to all that stuff
you said to Grandma?

42:59.867 --> 43:01.660
What happened to trusting me?

43:01.702 --> 43:05.164
- Where did all that go?
- It's back on Patty's yoga mats.

43:05.205 --> 43:06.707
This is crap!

43:06.790 --> 43:10.169
You know I didn't do anything.
You know this was an accident.

43:10.210 --> 43:12.004
You're just mad because I screwed up...

43:12.087 --> 43:14.882
and I did it in front of Grandma,
and she nailed you for it.

43:14.965 --> 43:18.969
I'm sorry that I screwed up,
and I'm sorry that you got yelled at...

43:19.053 --> 43:21.889
but I didn't do anything, and you know it!
