WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:05.005
‐ I want Project Blue Book

00:05.005 --> 00:07.257
to formally close
the Roswell incident.

00:07.257 --> 00:08.842
‐ Run!

00:08.842 --> 00:11.053
‐ You put Blue Book
in that position and they fail,

00:11.053 --> 00:14.181
those guys won't be the only
ones to lose their jobs.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.849
‐ Somebody left us a message.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.227
Tomorrow at 9:00 a. m.,
I will show the world proof

00:18.227 --> 00:20.562
of what really happened
in Roswell, New Mexico.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.356
‐ Yeah,
I'm actually calling to cancel.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.191
I'm out of town
for a couple days.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.609
‐ Don't be gone too long.

00:25.609 --> 00:27.402
I'll miss you.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.696
‐ There were two
separate crash sites.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.365
Recovered its remains

00:31.365 --> 00:33.617
buried under
a big dead tree on my land.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.578
‐ What is that?

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:08.735 --> 01:11.071
‐ Gentlemen,
fire them up and move it out.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.990
I want that crash site
fully contained.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.658
‐ Sir, yes, sir!

01:14.658 --> 01:16.076
‐ Sir, what's the situation?

01:16.076 --> 01:18.412
‐ Something crashed.
‐ Again?

01:18.412 --> 01:20.122
‐ Middle of town.

01:20.122 --> 01:22.416
The whole street's on fire.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.418
Move it out.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.088
Let's go.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.576
‐ Doc?

01:57.576 --> 01:59.286
‐ Your guess
is as good as mine.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.999
‐ Let's get some lights
out here and set a perimeter.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.709
50‐foot radius,
2‐man posts,

02:05.709 --> 02:07.044
and let's sweep
these buildings.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.463
I don't want anyone
near that thing.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.298
Professor,
what do you suggest‐‐

02:12.633 --> 02:14.051
Professor.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.470
Professor!
‐ It's okay.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.972
I know what this is.
‐ Doc.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.022
‐ Stand back.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.982
Stand back.
It's for your own safety.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.408
‐ Duncan.

02:40.619 --> 02:43.830
‐ Hello, General.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.666
‐ Duncan's claimed
responsibility

02:45.666 --> 02:47.501
for the entire stunt,
the letter,

02:47.501 --> 02:49.169
the whole damn thing.
‐ Here you are, sir.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.129
‐ To go through all that
trouble and turn himself in

02:51.129 --> 02:53.173
before the deadline
doesn't make any sense.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.342
‐ Well, he doesn't want it to,
not yet.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.843
He brought you here
for a reason, General.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.012
Whatever he's doing,
he's not done yet.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.514
‐ Well,
he's in my custody now.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.599
Trust me. He's done.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.564
Duncan Booker.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.067
It's been a while,
hasn't it?

03:12.067 --> 03:13.360
According to this,
you were a troublemaker

03:13.360 --> 03:14.861
back then as well.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.697
‐ Is that what
the Air Force thinks of me?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.865
‐ Well, spreading lies,
trying to create a panic,

03:18.865 --> 03:20.367
am I missing something?

03:20.367 --> 03:21.535
‐ You?

03:21.535 --> 03:24.287
You're missing a lot, General.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.540
‐

03:26.540 --> 03:28.375
Oh, don't get cute
with me now.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.211
‐ What exactly did he miss?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.213
The reason you created
all this chaos‐‐

03:33.213 --> 03:34.714
I'd like to know.
‐ Doc.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.925
‐ General, the public
is going to want to know

03:36.925 --> 03:38.718
what all this was about.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.887
Hearing it allows us a chance
to counter his narratives.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.848
Strategically, it makes sense.

03:42.848 --> 03:46.810
Now, I'm assuming
you have a story to tell.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.397
‐ Okay, Duncan.
Regale us.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.570
‐ Well, when you came

03:56.570 --> 03:58.989
to see Judy and I
and asked what we saw,

03:58.989 --> 04:00.907
I thought we were
supposed to tell the truth.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.659
‐ Sign it.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.786
‐ Sign it. Fucking sign it!
‐ Get that out of my face!

04:04.786 --> 04:06.580
I did.
Every detail.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.257
‐ They'll kill us, Duncan!
Just sign it!

04:17.257 --> 04:18.841
‐ They're not gonna kill us.
This is all bullshit.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.427
You told me to...

04:20.427 --> 04:22.679
never‐‐
‐ Repeat that story again.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.517
‐ And if I did,
there'd be consequences...

04:27.517 --> 04:28.602
when I asked why.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.187
‐ Sign it!

04:30.187 --> 04:31.855
‐ Why would I be punished...
‐ Take her in.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.482
‐ Just for telling
the world what I saw?

04:33.482 --> 04:34.608
That's when...

04:34.608 --> 04:35.609
Get the hell off of her!

04:35.609 --> 04:38.028
Things took a turn.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.704
You remember that, General?

04:47.704 --> 04:49.414
‐ You know what I remember?

04:49.414 --> 04:50.957
I remember you signing
a statement

04:50.957 --> 04:52.417
claiming that what you saw
was a weather balloon.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.627
So do me a favor‐‐

04:53.627 --> 04:55.212
Cut the bullshit
'cause every word

04:55.212 --> 04:56.922
out of your mouth
has been a lie.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.840
‐ You get everyone in D. C.
to sign the same thing?

04:58.840 --> 05:00.467
You were both there,
weren't you?

05:00.467 --> 05:03.053
When the saucers
flew over the Capitol?

05:03.053 --> 05:06.139
See, I saw you on TV
that weekend, and I thought,

05:06.139 --> 05:07.474
"Bastard's doing it again‐‐

05:07.474 --> 05:09.810
ruining more peoples' lives."

05:09.810 --> 05:11.311
Just couldn't
stomach it anymore.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.814
‐ So that's what this is
about‐‐revenge?

05:13.814 --> 05:16.358
‐ This is about
getting the truth out there!

05:16.358 --> 05:18.985
If these things really exist...

05:18.985 --> 05:20.987
it's about making sure
more people like me

05:20.987 --> 05:22.823
don't get beat down over it,

05:22.823 --> 05:25.659
'cause the world needs to know
what's really going on.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.167
‐ We're done here.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.920
‐ I still have a piece
of the saucer!

05:39.548 --> 05:41.466
Yeah.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.177
I may have made those stunts up
just to get your attention,

05:44.177 --> 05:46.513
but the part
about the evidence,

05:46.513 --> 05:48.014
that's true.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.474
‐ That's what you want
the world to see

05:49.474 --> 05:51.017
tomorrow morning?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.853
‐ Unless the general here
goes on TV and tells

05:52.853 --> 05:54.521
the truth about what really
happened here in Roswell.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.650
See, the plan's already
set in motion.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.443
I'm just giving you a chance
to do the right thing here

06:00.443 --> 06:01.778
and come clean.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.197
Either way,
truth is coming out.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.414
‐ I told you the people
in this town are nuts.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.999
‐ So what are we
gonna do with him?

06:13.999 --> 06:15.542
‐ Search his place first.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.085
‐ What for?
‐ Oh, I don't know, Professor.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.712
Maybe he's hiding
Santa Claus in the attic.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.882
Look, just go to his house

06:21.882 --> 06:23.550
and report back to me
what you find.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.510
We've only got a few hours
to shut this down.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.053
I want no stone unturned.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.305
Understood?

06:43.445 --> 06:45.780
‐ Can you stop that, please?
‐ What am I doing?

06:45.780 --> 06:48.950
‐ Your brain is, like,
in overdrive right now.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.994
I can hear
what you're thinking.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.580
The man built
a shrine in his house.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.498
He dumped a flying saucer
in the middle of town.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.500
He is crazy.
‐ You know what's crazy?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.544
The Air Force
paying people to be quiet,

06:59.544 --> 07:01.379
then beating them up
if they don't.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.922
That's crazy.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.094
‐ This is our turn.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.183
What are you doing?
Harding gave us an order.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.101
‐ He can give you an order.
I'm a civilian.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.604
I don't have to listen to him.
‐ Oh, stop the car.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.482
Doc.

07:20.482 --> 07:21.608
Stop the car.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.114
Great.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.788
Doc.
What are you doing?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.122
‐ We need to get to the bottom

07:36.122 --> 07:38.166
of what really
happened here tonight.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.126
‐ Booker just confessed
to faking the whole thing.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.711
‐ Yeah,
not the crash six years ago.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.963
‐ Harding already
confirmed it was a cover‐up.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.965
You forgetting that?
Project Mogul?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.509
‐ If you're under orders,
then by all means, go.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.968
I'm not stopping you.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.304
But Stewart's house,
it's just up there,

07:51.304 --> 07:52.514
and I want to check out
his story.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.973
‐ About aliens?

07:53.973 --> 07:55.809
On his property?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.727
You're not very good at this,
you know‐‐

07:57.727 --> 08:00.563
the whole undercover thing.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.149
Harding is expecting us
at Booker's.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.485
We do not show up‐‐
‐ It'll take 20 minutes...

08:05.485 --> 08:07.320
if you help.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.280
20 minutes
to know the truth.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.495
‐

08:26.423 --> 08:28.007
‐ What'd he say, again?

08:28.007 --> 08:30.677
‐ A dead tree
on the hill near the house.

09:04.210 --> 09:07.589
‐  Just about done
digging holes, Doc.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.093
‐ Just keep digging.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.137
‐ This is ridiculous.

09:17.432 --> 09:18.892
Hang on.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.896
Something there.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.898
Help me out.

09:27.025 --> 09:30.070
‐

09:35.241 --> 09:37.243
‐ What is that?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.350
You got to be kidding me.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.567
‐ Jim...

10:09.567 --> 10:11.236
‐ Tell me you found something
at Booker's house.

10:11.236 --> 10:14.656
‐
Whole lot of nothing.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.282
‐ Every square inch?

10:16.282 --> 10:18.034
‐ Ah, we could still
burn it down,

10:18.034 --> 10:19.285
dig through the foundation

10:19.285 --> 10:21.204
if it'll make you feel
any better.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.289
‐
‐ He turned himself in.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.749
He knew
we would search the house.

10:24.749 --> 10:25.834
‐ He's screwing with us.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.503
‐ He's been screwing with us.

10:28.503 --> 10:29.712
‐ I need to get a hold
of the captain.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.298
‐ Quinn? Why?
He wasn't there.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.843
At least he wasn't when I left.
Was he supposed to be?

10:45.728 --> 10:47.605
‐ You're going to wake
the dead.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.482
‐ Ha ha.
Very funny.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.359
‐ It is, actually.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.944
Hello.
Sorry for the late hour.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.821
I'm Dr. Allen Hynek.
This is Captain Michael Quinn.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.281
‐ United States Air Force.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.740
‐ We have a bit
of an emergency

10:57.740 --> 10:59.242
and need use
of your facilities.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.119
‐ Um...

11:01.119 --> 11:03.371
someone die?
‐ Yes.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.999
We're just not sure who.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.842
‐ Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit,
sit, sit, sit down.

11:18.678 --> 11:23.433
You know, six years ago,
I brought 200 men down here.

11:23.433 --> 11:27.437
We combed through every
square inch of the desert.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.398
We pulled metal out of trees,

11:30.398 --> 11:32.150
under rocks,

11:32.150 --> 11:35.028
places you wouldn't
even think to look.

11:35.028 --> 11:39.073
We even found a horse
that swallowed some.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.367
When we finished,

11:41.367 --> 11:43.870
I had them
start all over again.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.874
So do you really expect me

11:47.874 --> 11:49.584
to believe
that I missed something?

11:51.920 --> 11:55.423
‐ You'll find out
tomorrow morning.

12:22.700 --> 12:23.910
‐ You okay?

12:23.910 --> 12:25.495
Hey.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.372
I need you to know
I don't really enjoy this,

12:27.372 --> 12:29.082
but you have to understand
what's at stake here.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.959
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.835
Where is it?

12:32.835 --> 12:34.003
Where is it?

12:34.003 --> 12:36.965
‐ Okay. I'll tell you.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.259
First, you need
to write me a check.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.347
‐

12:44.347 --> 12:48.309
So this is all about money?

12:48.309 --> 12:50.311
‐ Mike Connors
got a brand‐new car

12:50.311 --> 12:52.063
two days
after he changed his story.

12:52.063 --> 12:55.358
Half of Roswell got checks
just to keep quiet.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.068
I want mine.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.361
‐ Let him go.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.699
So all this stuff
about trying to embarrass me

13:02.699 --> 13:04.701
or expose the truth‐‐

13:04.701 --> 13:07.036
‐ You hurt me back then.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.163
Destroyed this town.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.374
‐ I'm sorry, son.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.834
I truly am.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.878
Let's say I do pay you.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.714
How do I know you're not
gonna try this again?

13:17.714 --> 13:20.425
‐ I had an idea about that.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.260
Something to...

13:22.260 --> 13:25.054
set your mind at ease.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.098
‐ Where'd you get this?

13:27.098 --> 13:28.725
‐ That's classified.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.987
‐ They're definitely
not human.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.530
‐ You're sure?

13:42.530 --> 13:45.408
‐ I'm just a mortician,
not a doctor.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.702
I‐I don't really do this.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.999
Tell me again
what this is about.

13:52.999 --> 13:56.085
‐ Uh, you ever hear
of Project Blue Book?

13:56.085 --> 14:00.506
‐ That's the Air Force program
to investigate flying saucers.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.634
I don't trust the Air Force.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.054
‐ Neither do we.
We don't work for them.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.308
We work for you,
the people.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.935
That's why we're here...

14:12.935 --> 14:14.520
to find out
what really happened here

14:14.520 --> 14:16.105
in Roswell six years ago.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.648
‐ That what all
the commotion's been about?

14:17.648 --> 14:19.192
The checkpoints and whatnot?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.235
‐ That's right.

14:21.235 --> 14:24.197
Yeah, someone's out there
spreading more lies.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.492
And we're doing whatever we can
to get to the truth.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.786
‐ I like that.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.746
‐ You know,
you tell us what you know...

14:31.746 --> 14:33.706
maybe you can be a hero.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.547
‐ Are these part
of those things...

14:41.547 --> 14:42.632
that flew the ship?

14:42.632 --> 14:44.258
‐ Flew the ship?

14:44.258 --> 14:46.010
‐ Yeah.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.428
There were five of them.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.721
‐ Five of what?

14:50.306 --> 14:51.474
‐ You know...

14:52.725 --> 14:54.102
Aliens.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.854
‐ And how do you know that?

14:56.854 --> 14:59.982
‐ Because the night
of the crash, I got a call.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.026
Hello?

15:02.026 --> 15:05.321
Base was asking if I had
five child‐sized coffins

15:05.321 --> 15:07.907
I could deliver to them ASAP.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.659
Ask yourself...

15:09.659 --> 15:11.285
what would
a military base need

15:11.285 --> 15:13.830
with five
child‐sized coffins?

15:13.830 --> 15:15.540
Hmm?

15:15.540 --> 15:17.500
‐ And how did you wind up
on the base that night?

15:17.500 --> 15:21.504
‐ I double as the ambulance
driver in Roswell.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.506
One of the captains
got into a motorcycle wreck,

15:23.506 --> 15:25.133
needed a transport.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.971
When I got there, the place
was crazy with activity,

15:29.971 --> 15:32.431
like we were under attack
or something.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.934
I asked what was going on.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.936
No one would talk to me.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.523
So I went looking
for someone who would.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.777
Wound up running into a nurse.
She told me...

15:44.777 --> 15:47.780
‐ You need to leave,
or they'll throw you in jail.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.323
‐ Copy that, sir!

15:50.783 --> 15:53.369
‐ And what was
going on in there?

15:54.620 --> 15:56.164
‐ From what I could see...

15:59.083 --> 16:01.502
It looked like
an alien autopsy.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.686
‐ I don't know, Doc.

16:18.686 --> 16:19.896
Second‐hand account,
six years ago,

16:19.896 --> 16:21.314
and he wasn't even in the room.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.899
‐ I wasn't in the room
when my son was born,

16:22.899 --> 16:24.650
but I'm pretty sure Mimi
had something to do with it.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.028
You know,
if we can find this nurse

16:27.028 --> 16:28.613
and she confirms his story‐‐

16:28.613 --> 16:30.907
‐ What‐‐then what?
Go to Harding?

16:30.907 --> 16:34.076
If he really did cover this up,
we can't come to him with this.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.954
‐ Where have you been?

16:36.954 --> 16:39.540
I gave you an order to
supervise a search of Booker's.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.584
Blackstone said
you didn't even show.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.586
‐ Yeah, about that, sir‐‐
‐ I took a wrong turn.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.922
Uh, the roads out here
are so poorly marked,

16:45.922 --> 16:48.341
so it was my fault.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.842
‐ We're going home.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.719
Booker's changed his story.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.721
He's agreed to make
a public confession

16:53.721 --> 16:55.640
at the local TV station
in a couple of hours.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.934
In exchange,
we won't press charges.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.310
‐ What?

16:59.310 --> 17:01.646
‐ We had a talk,
came to an understanding.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.940
And I apologized.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.525
Honestly, I think that's all he
ever wanted from the beginning.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.818
‐ And he's going on TV?

17:07.818 --> 17:09.028
‐ We both are.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.320
To make light
of the whole thing,

17:10.320 --> 17:12.240
kind of like
that Orson Welles thing.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.367
The name of the game
is "control the narrative."

17:14.367 --> 17:16.077
Thought you two
would've learned that by now.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.662
‐ That doesn't
really make sense.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.204
‐ That's great news, sir.
‐ Yes, it is, Captain.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.123
The kind worth celebrating.
I'm thinking scotch.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.501
Got a little time before
I have to be at the station.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.671
"Yes, General.
That sounds great."

17:26.671 --> 17:28.256
‐ I just feel like we've got
more important‐‐

17:28.256 --> 17:29.674
‐ Yes, General,
that sounds great.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.217
‐ See you in my office
in 10 minutes.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.302
And a little attitude
adjustment, Professor.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.096
I'm not opening up
a good bottle

17:35.096 --> 17:38.015
if you're gonna be
sour about it.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.602
The "Enola Gay"‐‐

17:41.602 --> 17:44.021
she was based out of Roswell.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.565
Bet you didn't know that,
Professor.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.484
509th bomb squadron.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.902
I arranged to have her shipped

17:49.902 --> 17:52.321
to the Smithsonian
after her service.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.073
History like that
needs to be preserved.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.285
‐ Over 70,000 Japanese died
in Hiroshima.

17:57.285 --> 18:00.454
Shouldn't that history
be preserved as well?

18:00.454 --> 18:03.040
‐ We were at war, Professor.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.458
Many more would've died,

18:04.458 --> 18:06.377
Americans and Japanese,
had we not taken

18:06.377 --> 18:08.588
the decisive action to end it.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.256
‐
Oh, well, in that case,

18:10.256 --> 18:15.094
I'm sure it was a painfully
difficult choice to make.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.889
‐ It was the only way to
protect the world from chaos.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.935
And it requires a special
kind of man to do that...

18:24.854 --> 18:27.106
The kind of man who knows
where the line is drawn

18:27.106 --> 18:31.527
that separates the unthinkable
from the necessary...

18:31.527 --> 18:34.280
the kind of man
that has a job to do

18:34.280 --> 18:35.489
and gets it done.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.993
That's what makes a hero.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.457
To men like that.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.125
To men like us.

18:48.586 --> 18:51.964
‐ I know there are hard calls
to make, General, but I also...

18:51.964 --> 18:54.800
recognize the way some men

18:54.800 --> 18:57.053
call their inhumanity
necessary.

18:57.053 --> 19:00.014
In my eyes,
that doesn't make a hero.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.724
It makes a coward.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.476
‐ Maybe lay off
the scotch, Doc.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.353
‐ Did you
just call me a coward?

19:05.353 --> 19:07.229
‐ Yes, I suppose I am.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.648
‐ All right, let's get you‐‐
‐ You see, because deep down,

19:08.648 --> 19:11.192
that's exactly what you are,
General.

19:11.192 --> 19:12.943
You know it,
and you won't do anything

19:12.943 --> 19:15.237
to try to change it,
so you tell me this.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.239
Between men like us,

19:17.239 --> 19:19.241
how long can you pretend

19:19.241 --> 19:21.869
to believe in something
that you know is not true?

19:28.125 --> 19:30.127
I need to urinate.

19:37.218 --> 19:41.514
‐ Well, now, there's a man
who cannot handle his liquor.

19:45.393 --> 19:48.187
Sir, permission
to see if he's okay.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.605
‐ Yeah.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.774
And, uh...

19:51.774 --> 19:53.901
tell Professor Hynek
that tonight is his last night

19:53.901 --> 19:56.696
as a member
of Project Blue Book.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.323
I think I've had quite enough
of that son of a bitch.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.369
‐ Sir, yes, sir.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.670
What the hell was that?

20:12.670 --> 20:13.963
Do you realize
what you just did?

20:13.963 --> 20:15.923
‐ Just come on.
We don't have much time.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.425
‐ Hold on.
You're not drunk.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.302
‐ Yes.
Undercover, remember?

20:20.302 --> 20:21.929
He'll never suspect
a thing now,

20:21.929 --> 20:25.057
and we both got
out of that performance.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.809
‐ What, you thought calling
Harding a coward

20:26.809 --> 20:28.227
was a good way
to get us out of the room?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.478
‐ Yeah.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.272
‐ He told me
to tell you you're fired.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.651
‐ Well, I guess I have
nothing to lose now.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.452
Confound it!
‐ Doc.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.495
Look, just don't try to talk me
out of this now, okay?

20:46.495 --> 20:48.038
I've seen too much,

20:48.038 --> 20:50.750
and 've got to get
to the bottom of this.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.084
‐ Earlier,
I checked with the guard.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.377
I was just gonna wait
till we're done,

20:53.377 --> 20:55.004
but you had to go
and get all dramatic.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.756
‐ So you do believe
Duncan's story?

20:56.756 --> 20:58.841
‐ What I believe in
is finding out the truth.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.426
And we made a pact.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.178
I don't go back on my word.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.849
I'll look
for the duty roster of '47.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.100
You grab a phone book.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.643
We'll cross‐reference
in the car.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.605
How many more?

21:12.605 --> 21:14.231
‐ Four.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.775
‐ I don't know if we'll have
time for that, Doc.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.443
Harding's due on TV
in under two hours.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.986
‐ The next one's close by.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.280
Says here she subbed in
the night of the crash.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.491
Her address is...

21:26.076 --> 21:27.411
Oh.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.622
‐ What is it?
‐ This nurse...

21:29.622 --> 21:31.707
her last name...

21:31.707 --> 21:33.709
it's different
in the phone book.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.169
‐ Shit.
‐ Yeah.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.506
It's about a half a mile
up here on the left.

21:38.506 --> 21:39.548
‐ Imagine that.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.559
‐ Looks like
someone's headed out.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.353
‐ Got here just in time.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.789
‐ Judy.
‐

22:11.789 --> 22:13.499
‐ Hey, sorry
for the scare, miss.

22:13.499 --> 22:14.917
That your name?
Judy?

22:14.917 --> 22:17.044
‐ Yes. Who are you?

22:17.044 --> 22:18.546
‐ Well,
I'm Captain Michael Quinn.

22:18.546 --> 22:20.214
This is Dr. Allen Hynek.

22:20.214 --> 22:22.466
We're from Project Blue Book.
United States Air Force.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.260
‐ Uh, maybe
we could talk inside.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.929
‐ I was just heading out,
so if you could move your car.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.640
‐ Uh, it's about your husband.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.893
‐ I don't have a husband.

22:32.893 --> 22:36.146
‐ That's funny because he said
he wasn't married either.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.232
The military record
only lists your maiden name,

22:38.232 --> 22:41.360
but the phone book‐‐
that had your married one.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.571
Booker, isn't it?

22:43.571 --> 22:44.989
‐ Hold on.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.117
It's okay.
We're friendlies.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.035
‐
‐ Wait, where you going?

22:50.035 --> 22:52.496
Hey.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.498
‐ Give me that back!

22:54.498 --> 22:56.208
‐ You just assaulted a captain
in the United States Air Force.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.963
‐ Oh, my God.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.281
‐ They're real.

24:21.335 --> 24:22.753
‐ Captain.

24:22.753 --> 24:23.837
‐ How did she
even get that film?

24:23.837 --> 24:25.631
‐ Captain.
‐ Doc, Doc.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.175
That is not just highly
classified government property.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.969
That's‐‐that's‐‐
Do you even realize

24:29.969 --> 24:32.179
what kind of trouble
you're in right now, huh?

24:32.179 --> 24:34.765
Stealing a piece of
sensitive material like that?

24:34.765 --> 24:36.183
T‐t‐that's worse
than the Rosenbergs.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.893
‐ Captain.
‐ It's just‐‐

24:37.893 --> 24:39.979
‐ This is the final piece.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.817
Where were you going with this
when we pulled up?

24:46.819 --> 24:49.154
TV station?
Right?

24:51.323 --> 24:53.993
This is what Duncan wanted all
along‐‐it's what he planned.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.536
‐ What are you talking about?

24:55.536 --> 24:58.330
‐ He was telling us
the truth first time.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.124
He wants revenge.

25:00.124 --> 25:03.335
And he was gonna get it
by showing this to Harding...

25:03.335 --> 25:05.337
on live TV.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.339
Showing it to the world.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.632
‐ Is that true?

25:10.134 --> 25:11.635
So the station,

25:11.635 --> 25:13.178
they need to be prepared
for something like this.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.514
‐ Which means
that they are in on it, too.

25:17.433 --> 25:18.684
‐ What are you
going to do with it?

25:18.684 --> 25:20.310
The film?
‐ What, what?

25:20.310 --> 25:22.646
The cinematic evidence
of alien fucking life?

25:24.565 --> 25:26.692
I don't know.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.318
How about you tell me

25:28.318 --> 25:29.862
if there's any goddamn bourbon
in the house?

25:29.862 --> 25:31.864
And we'll go from there.
‐ Did they put it through?

25:31.864 --> 25:33.365
‐ Yes, sir,
he should be on the line.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.035
‐ Ah.

25:38.579 --> 25:42.791
What is it with this town?
It's like the gates of hell.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.085
‐ Are you drunk?

25:45.085 --> 25:46.086
‐ Oh.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.796
‐ Jim...

25:47.796 --> 25:49.673
you've got to be on live TV
in less than an hour.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.508
You can't screw this up.

25:51.508 --> 25:55.054
‐ Look, if I can pull myself
together after ditching a plane

25:55.054 --> 25:57.347
over Guadalcanal
during the war,

25:57.347 --> 25:59.683
I sure as shit can do
a ten‐minute interview

25:59.683 --> 26:02.019
on live TV
after a couple of drinks.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.689
‐ I called the station.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.775
It's patched in nationwide.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.736
I'm just making sure
that you're okay.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.572
That's all.
‐ You‐‐you...

26:13.572 --> 26:15.574
You're welcome.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.244
‐ The State Department called.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.705
This got on their radar.

26:21.705 --> 26:24.458
You blow it,
Blue Book goes away.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.293
You go away.

26:26.293 --> 26:28.337
‐ Look...

26:28.337 --> 26:31.090
I fixed it the last time,
didn't I?

26:31.090 --> 26:32.257
Didn't I?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.052
‐ Yes, you did.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.388
Yes, you did, Jim.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.061
‐ Yeah.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.439
Yeah, I did.

26:47.439 --> 26:50.234
‐ So what do we do?

26:50.234 --> 26:52.945
‐ Right now she stays here
till we sort this all out.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.489
‐ Am I under arrest?
‐ Why, you, uh‐‐you leaving?

26:55.489 --> 26:56.532
‐ Got to keep an eye on her.

26:56.532 --> 26:57.866
‐ Unless I'm under arrest,

26:57.866 --> 26:59.618
you can't force me
to stay here.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.662
‐ Being under arrest would be
a vacation for you right now.

27:01.662 --> 27:03.622
Trust me, you're staying here.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.541
‐ Oh, no, don't.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.459
What are‐‐what are you planning
on, uh‐‐on doing with this?

27:07.459 --> 27:09.086
‐ That is Air Force property.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.796
‐ What, so you're gonna show it
to Harding?

27:10.796 --> 27:13.090
Really?
After all that we've seen?

27:14.633 --> 27:17.302
Look, you do know
what we saw, right,

27:17.302 --> 27:20.264
and what that means
for the world?

27:20.264 --> 27:23.016
‐ Doc, come on, don't do this.
Give me the film.

27:23.016 --> 27:25.018
Come on.
‐

27:28.105 --> 27:30.649
Okay, um,
I understand.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.318
You know, um, I don't want you
to get in trouble

27:33.318 --> 27:36.154
or to have to put you
in that position.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.614
Have another drink.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.324
Why don't we both
have another drink?

27:39.324 --> 27:41.660
‐ Sorry.
‐ Okay.

28:19.197 --> 28:20.699
‐ General.
‐ Where'd you go, Captain?

28:20.699 --> 28:22.034
Where is the professor?

28:22.034 --> 28:23.535
‐ Sir,
I need to speak with you.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.786
In private.
It's urgent.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.163
‐ Sir, we need to get going.

28:26.163 --> 28:28.624
‐ This won't take long.
Excuse us.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.837
If you're trying to talk me
into saving his job‐‐

28:33.837 --> 28:35.839
‐ Was it really a spy balloon
that crashed in '47?

28:35.839 --> 28:37.382
‐ Oh, for Pete's sake.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.384
‐ Because I've seen evidence
to the contrary tonight.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.511
‐ Captain, I'm in no mood.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.643
What is this?

28:47.643 --> 28:49.811
‐ That's, uh...

28:49.811 --> 28:51.897
You need to see it, sir...

28:51.897 --> 28:53.857
if you haven't already.

28:53.857 --> 28:55.901
And, uh, I might add that,
given what's on there,

28:55.901 --> 28:59.237
I will need to be briefed
at the highest levels.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.077
‐ Is this a joke?

29:05.077 --> 29:06.578
‐ General?
‐ I'm coming.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.205
What the hell is this, Captain?

29:10.540 --> 29:12.417
You know what?

29:12.417 --> 29:15.837
When I get back,
you and I are gonna talk.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.631
Let's go.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.121
‐ How far did you get?

29:49.121 --> 29:50.747
‐ All the way.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.460
You know, I really thought,

29:55.460 --> 29:56.962
at the end of the day,
we had each other's backs.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.839
‐ You were making
a rash decision.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.382
‐ So, when it comes
down to it,

30:00.382 --> 30:02.759
you'll just do
what you got to do for you,

30:02.759 --> 30:04.469
not us.

30:04.469 --> 30:05.804
‐

30:14.980 --> 30:17.107
‐ Where's Judy?

30:19.526 --> 30:21.528
Doc...

30:21.528 --> 30:23.405
where's Judy?

30:23.405 --> 30:25.949
‐ Headed to the TV station.
‐

30:27.534 --> 30:29.077
And the film?

30:29.077 --> 30:30.829
‐ It was never ours
to begin with.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.497
I just didn't
want to be the one

30:32.497 --> 30:34.541
responsible for hiding
the greatest‐‐

30:38.003 --> 30:40.047
‐

30:46.094 --> 30:48.096
‐

31:01.693 --> 31:03.653
‐ Phone's not working.

31:03.653 --> 31:05.447
Can't get through
to the TV station.

31:05.447 --> 31:07.365
‐ You won't make it on time.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.451
‐ Not if I take the main roads.

31:09.451 --> 31:10.911
I'm not going to.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.053
What are you doing?
‐ I'm coming with you.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.137
‐ No, you're not.
‐ Yes, I am.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.472
‐ No, you're not.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.226
Damn it!

31:40.732 --> 31:42.150
‐ General,
nice to see you, sir.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.902
‐ Pleasure's mine.
Thank you very much.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.529
Uh, so where we doing this?
‐ Uh, right this way, sir.

31:45.529 --> 31:47.197
We're just getting set up
for you now.

31:47.197 --> 31:49.407
Can we get some makeup
on the general, please?

31:49.407 --> 31:50.659
Come on through, guys.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.577
‐
How are you?

31:52.577 --> 31:54.162
‐ Uh, well. Thank you, sir.
‐ Thank you.

31:55.497 --> 31:56.706
‐ Is she here yet?

31:58.208 --> 32:00.001
‐ No, we still got time.
We still got time.

32:00.001 --> 32:01.878
Uh, right through here,
gentlemen.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.213
Right through here.

32:03.213 --> 32:05.215
‐
No, no, no, no.

32:05.215 --> 32:06.925
It's like putting
lipstick on a pig.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.343
‐

32:34.911 --> 32:36.538
‐ Captain.

32:37.873 --> 32:39.416
Michael.

32:39.416 --> 32:41.209
‐ The least you could do
is not talk right now.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.961
‐ I'm sorry.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.088
‐ Well, a lot of good that'll
do me at court martial.

32:45.088 --> 32:48.133
‐ If this film gets broadcast,
everything changes.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.218
‐ For better
or for worse?

32:50.218 --> 32:51.595
You have no idea.

32:51.595 --> 32:53.930
You do not know
what's gonna happen.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.224
But someone
is gonna take the fall.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.642
Guess who
they'll be looking at now.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.311
‐ Yeah, you're right.
I don't know.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.770
And if they do blame you,

33:00.770 --> 33:02.439
I'll say that you had nothing
to do with it.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.649
‐ Oh, but I did. I did have
something to do with it.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.776
‐ Yes, so imagine that.
Imagine that.

33:06.776 --> 33:09.154
Imagine a world
with the truth out there

33:09.154 --> 33:10.655
and your name
associated with that.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.909
‐ There is no one truth, Doc.

33:13.909 --> 33:16.161
Not with anything.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.121
It's just like what
went on here six years ago.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.457
No one's ever gonna know
what really happened.

33:20.457 --> 33:22.584
You know why?

33:22.584 --> 33:24.753
'Cause maybe the world
isn't ready to hear

33:24.753 --> 33:26.421
that aliens exist.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.677
‐ And this is your camera here.
You can look directly into it.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.679
Duncan, yours is that one.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.972
You don't
have to raise your voices.

33:35.972 --> 33:37.724
The mics up here
will pick everything up.

33:37.724 --> 33:40.268
‐ Thank you very much.
Just cue me for the countdown.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.524
You want to review
what you're gonna say first?

33:46.524 --> 33:48.109
‐ Oh, yes.
Thanks.

33:48.109 --> 33:49.527
‐ Don't worry
if you miss a few words.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.905
I'll make sure
that we stay on track.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.377
‐ 30 seconds, guys.
‐

34:05.377 --> 34:06.878
‐ Hey.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.295
Don't be nervous.

34:19.306 --> 34:21.059
‐ There's her truck.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.853
‐ Hey.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.981
We may never
get this chance again.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.899
‐ A man needs to know
where the line is drawn

34:27.899 --> 34:30.443
that separates the unthinkable
from the necessary.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.406
‐ Ten seconds, everyone.

34:35.739 --> 34:38.076
Nine...

34:38.076 --> 34:39.911
eight...

34:39.911 --> 34:41.579
seven...

34:41.579 --> 34:43.331
six...

34:43.331 --> 34:44.748
five...

34:55.510 --> 34:56.553
‐ Good evening.

34:56.553 --> 34:57.929
I'm General James Harding

34:57.929 --> 35:00.098
from the United States
Air Force,

35:00.098 --> 35:03.518
and we're here tonight
live in Roswell, New Mexico.

35:03.518 --> 35:06.104
I want to talk
to you people about a rumor

35:06.104 --> 35:08.106
that's been circulating
again...

35:08.106 --> 35:09.899
about a mysterious crash
that's happened here

35:09.899 --> 35:11.943
in the desert of New Mexico.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.778
And I want to tell you,
the people of America,

35:13.778 --> 35:15.572
that it's just a hoax.

35:15.572 --> 35:17.657
And the hoaxer is here
with us this evening.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.451
Duncan, why don't you tell
the good people

35:19.451 --> 35:22.037
about the stunt
that you pulled?

35:22.037 --> 35:25.915
‐ The stunt‐‐yes, let's talk
about the stunt I pulled.

35:25.915 --> 35:28.710
Six years ago, this man,
General Harding,

35:28.710 --> 35:30.337
came into my house

35:30.337 --> 35:32.464
and threatened to kill
me and my fiancée

35:32.464 --> 35:34.215
if we didn't lie
about what we saw.

35:34.215 --> 35:37.552
He even wrote me a check
earlier today

35:37.552 --> 35:39.137
to make sure I stayed quiet.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.389
That is your signature,
isn't it, General?

35:44.309 --> 35:46.478
‐ Why would you do this?

35:46.478 --> 35:48.313
‐ But I won't stay quiet.

35:48.313 --> 35:49.814
Not anymore.

35:49.814 --> 35:52.108
Roll it, Fred.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.246
‐ You son of a bitch.
What are you doing?

36:30.146 --> 36:31.856
‐ How you gonna
cover that up, huh,

36:31.856 --> 36:33.274
now that
the whole world's seen it?

36:33.274 --> 36:34.984
‐ How did you get that?

36:34.984 --> 36:36.444
How did you get that?
Are we still live?

36:36.444 --> 36:37.946
Turn that off.
Turn off that film.

36:37.946 --> 36:38.988
Turns those cameras around.

36:38.988 --> 36:40.365
Turn them around!

36:45.995 --> 36:46.996
You have no idea
what you've just done,

36:46.996 --> 36:48.206
you son of a bitch.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.833
‐ It's okay, General!

36:49.833 --> 36:51.042
It's okay!

36:51.042 --> 36:52.502
‐ Professor?

36:52.502 --> 36:55.171
‐ No one outside
of this room saw anything.

36:55.171 --> 36:58.049
I had the, uh...
switchboard disabled

36:58.049 --> 37:01.136
before any signal
was broadcast.

37:03.012 --> 37:05.849
The film is a fake, sir.

37:07.475 --> 37:09.519
‐ No one gets in
or out of here, understood?

37:09.519 --> 37:10.729
Everyone needs
to be questioned.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.313
Round them up.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.065
‐ You, uh...

37:14.065 --> 37:15.900
you overexposed the negative
to wash out any detail,

37:15.900 --> 37:18.486
but it didn't hide the pattern
of the studio lights.

37:18.486 --> 37:22.157
And it does have
a very distinctive pattern.

37:24.993 --> 37:26.828
You'll see the same when
you check back over the film.

37:26.828 --> 37:30.540
The clock there as well.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.001
The film was shot right here...

37:33.001 --> 37:36.921
by Duncan, his wife, Judy,

37:36.921 --> 37:38.882
the help
of the station manager,

37:38.882 --> 37:41.509
and a couple of other actors.

37:43.553 --> 37:44.888
It's over, Duncan.

37:44.888 --> 37:46.681
You may as well come
fully clean now.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.268
‐ Judy was there that day.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.936
Everything in that film
she saw with her own eyes.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.563
It's still the truth.
‐ Take him back to the base.

37:53.563 --> 37:55.398
‐ This doesn't change anything.

37:55.398 --> 37:57.275
You still tried to cover up
the existence of alien life.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.860
‐ Now!
Get him out of here!

37:58.860 --> 38:00.779
‐ Yes, sir.
‐ Don't you touch her.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.947
‐ You can't do this! Duncan!
‐ It's the truth! You saw them!

38:02.947 --> 38:04.908
They're real!
The truth has to get out there!

38:04.908 --> 38:06.326
You know it!
You saw them!

38:06.326 --> 38:07.702
You saw them!

38:22.383 --> 38:23.968
‐ How did you know?

38:23.968 --> 38:27.096
‐ Captain Quinn
figured out the connection.

38:27.096 --> 38:29.265
He raced here with me
to help stop it,

38:29.265 --> 38:31.726
so he deserves all the credit.

38:42.904 --> 38:45.156
‐ Thank you.
‐ You're welcome, sir.

39:01.965 --> 39:04.259
The light grid pattern, huh?

39:04.259 --> 39:06.427
‐ I'm surprised
you didn't notice it, too.

39:06.427 --> 39:09.097
‐ Only you
would notice that, Doc.

39:09.097 --> 39:11.641
‐ Duncan, Judy, Connors‐‐
a lot of people

39:11.641 --> 39:14.060
went through a lot of trouble
to see Harding ruined.

39:14.060 --> 39:16.604
‐ I know what you're saying.

39:16.604 --> 39:19.023
‐ What am I saying?

39:19.023 --> 39:21.526
‐ Why not just let
the film play?

39:21.526 --> 39:23.194
Fake or not,
the attention it would've got,

39:23.194 --> 39:24.654
the press...

39:24.654 --> 39:26.489
Sooner or later,
the truth would've come out.

39:26.489 --> 39:29.742
‐ Can't expose the truth
by using a lie.

39:29.742 --> 39:32.287
Do that,
we'd be worse than Harding.

40:08.573 --> 40:11.034
‐ You accepted my invitation.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.830
‐ I thought I was
under orders, Captain.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.848
You know,
I don't usually move this fast.

40:35.058 --> 40:36.893
‐ Well...

40:36.893 --> 40:39.687
I'm the one who showed you
where the spare key was.

40:45.902 --> 40:48.279
‐

40:48.279 --> 40:50.490
‐ Can I...

40:50.490 --> 40:53.201
ask you a serious question?

40:54.744 --> 40:56.871
‐ Absolutely not.

41:35.284 --> 41:36.995
‐

41:36.995 --> 41:39.580
Allen, you're home.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.332
‐ I am home.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.670
‐ Come here.

41:51.175 --> 41:54.804
‐ How did you know
I needed that?

41:54.804 --> 41:56.931
‐ How'd it all work out?

42:15.450 --> 42:18.786
‐ Well, I'll give them credit.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.955
Quality was impressive.

42:32.633 --> 42:35.887
Jim, what you saw in '47...

42:35.887 --> 42:37.889
‐ It's what the Soviets
wanted us to see, I know.

42:37.889 --> 42:41.225
‐ They wanted us to panic.
And we didn't.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.477
‐ But what we found
on that craft‐‐

42:42.477 --> 42:45.021
‐ Was the sick work
of Dr. Mengele.

42:45.021 --> 42:47.482
What he did
to those children's bodies,

42:47.482 --> 42:48.983
disfiguring them,

42:48.983 --> 42:51.986
making them look inhuman,
was unconscionable.

42:56.449 --> 42:59.994
Jim...
you didn't fall for it then.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.622
Don't fall for it now.

43:02.622 --> 43:04.665
‐ Of course not.

43:07.043 --> 43:08.669
‐ And I'll take care of that.

43:08.669 --> 43:10.421
‐ Put it in the vault
with the rest of them?

43:10.421 --> 43:14.258
‐ Sure. Maybe in 10 years'
time, we'll release it.

43:14.258 --> 43:17.428
Give the masses
a little more to chew on, huh?
