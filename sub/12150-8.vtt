00:01.929 --> 00:03.469
Previously on Angel:

00:05.530 --> 00:07.389
- What are you?
- You already know.

00:07.929 --> 00:09.789
I'm glad we're not friends.

00:10.330 --> 00:13.419
Don't blame me for everything
you can't handle.

00:13.929 --> 00:15.960
They brought Darla back.

00:16.329 --> 00:18.190
This is no life, Angel.

00:18.730 --> 00:21.780
My boy's still in there,
and he wants out.

00:25.929 --> 00:29.370
This creep knows what happened.
He's playing us.

00:30.129 --> 00:31.460
Might be.

00:32.530 --> 00:34.280
He's got mental problems.

00:34.929 --> 00:38.929
I don't care about that.
We got one body already.

00:39.729 --> 00:43.909
- And if she dies?
- If she dies, he's all yours.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.530 --> 00:59.200
We can help you.
Tell us what you know...

00:59.530 --> 01:01.740
...and we'll send you back to holding.

01:04.328 --> 01:07.140
You stay quiet,
my partner dents your skull.

01:07.930 --> 01:09.329
Hey, you listening?

01:11.530 --> 01:15.390
I think you got involved in something
bigger than you expected.

01:15.730 --> 01:19.560
You got scared, panicked
and an officer ended up on the floor.

01:21.730 --> 01:24.260
Not to mention the body
without a head.

01:27.730 --> 01:30.260
- Do yourself--
- She shouldn't have been there.

01:30.730 --> 01:32.099
She didn't know.

01:34.329 --> 01:36.890
He didn't know what
he was getting into.

01:37.329 --> 01:40.170
None of them did.
If they'd known, they--

01:42.730 --> 01:44.939
You didn't bring it here, did you?

01:47.530 --> 01:48.370
No.

01:50.530 --> 01:53.620
No, then it'd be too late
for all of us.

01:56.530 --> 01:58.780
He grabbed her hard.

02:00.129 --> 02:01.319
Very hard.

02:05.530 --> 02:08.229
I'm quite good with the ladies myself.

02:08.530 --> 02:10.669
Just tell us what happened.

02:14.530 --> 02:16.849
It all went horribly wrong.

03:20.930 --> 03:25.069
None of us knew the effect
it would have until it was too late.

03:26.330 --> 03:28.009
I tried to stop him...

03:29.330 --> 03:31.500
...but I got hit and fell.

03:32.330 --> 03:35.280
And when I looked up, he had her.

03:35.930 --> 03:38.389
He was holding her.

03:38.930 --> 03:41.770
Then she was on the floor.

03:44.330 --> 03:48.259
If we'd found out sooner, I would
have stopped him. I would have.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.729
Stopped who?

03:52.129 --> 03:54.379
He should never have been there.

03:55.129 --> 03:57.449
Of all people, he should never--

03:59.930 --> 04:03.830
You don't tell him what to do.
He's the boss.

04:04.729 --> 04:06.270
The boss?

04:07.729 --> 04:09.620
He helps people, you know.

04:10.729 --> 04:14.939
When he's not in trouble himself.
Cordy and I tried to get him out.

04:15.530 --> 04:17.110
She was with me.

04:18.529 --> 04:20.040
Oh, God....

04:20.930 --> 04:22.300
Cordelia.

04:22.689 --> 04:24.230
- Your head.
- Excuse me?

04:25.089 --> 04:26.459
Your hair.

04:26.889 --> 04:27.970
It's new.

04:29.889 --> 04:31.569
It's great!

04:32.290 --> 04:34.639
- When did this happen?
- Ten days ago.

04:35.290 --> 04:38.199
Of course. I didn't want
to embarrass you by--

04:38.889 --> 04:40.360
Noticing?

04:43.089 --> 04:46.529
- Nice suit.
- I was just on my way out to--

04:46.689 --> 04:51.149
Yet another glamorous celebrity-filled
gala with Miss Virginia Bryce?

04:54.490 --> 04:58.319
We should check on Angel.
He doesn't seem to do much lately.

04:59.290 --> 05:01.389
Au contraire, His day is packed.

05:01.689 --> 05:03.860
Brood about Darla,
brood about Darla...

05:04.089 --> 05:06.230
...lunch, followed by Darla-brooding.

05:07.089 --> 05:11.660
Right. Enough is enough. I'm gonna
march up there and tell him just that.

05:15.490 --> 05:17.810
- Nice posturing.
- Thank you.

05:18.490 --> 05:22.110
He's not there. Gunn's cousin
is involved in something big.

05:22.689 --> 05:25.810
Big, meaning illegal.
Angel and Gunn went to help.

05:26.290 --> 05:30.430
That's good. He's getting out.
Something I'm gonna do myself.

05:31.689 --> 05:34.670
Traipsing off to your shallow,
soul-sucking party?

05:35.290 --> 05:39.709
Premiere, actually.
And I happen to have an extra ticket.

05:40.089 --> 05:42.050
Who does shallow better than me?

05:48.170 --> 05:49.709
- He cool, right?
- He's cool.

05:50.569 --> 05:53.240
I'm not prejudiced.
I just hate vampires.

05:53.569 --> 05:56.519
- You're enlightened. I can tell.
- See how they do?

05:57.170 --> 06:00.120
They mess with your mind.
That's why I called you--

06:00.769 --> 06:04.769
You got a vampire problem,
Angel has experience in that area.

06:05.569 --> 06:07.959
Yo, spill it. We ain't got all night.

06:09.170 --> 06:13.240
I sort of said I'd take this job
driving for this big-time crew.

06:13.970 --> 06:16.500
E.J. vouched for me,
but now I'm thinking--

06:16.970 --> 06:18.620
- You don't like prison.
- Yeah.

06:19.370 --> 06:22.850
And they're bringing in
this psycho vampire from Vegas.

06:23.490 --> 06:25.660
- And like I said, man--
- What's the job?

06:25.889 --> 06:28.379
Taking off some museum.
Don't know which.

06:29.490 --> 06:33.740
- What are they after?
- Something big. Supernatural.

06:34.889 --> 06:38.579
It's going down this week,
but I'm meeting the boss tonight.

06:39.089 --> 06:42.209
And if I don't show,
I'll be hunted down and killed.

06:42.689 --> 06:44.160
Where's the meet?

06:51.089 --> 06:53.689
- Psycho vampire got a name?
- Yeah.

06:54.689 --> 06:58.310
E.J. said it.
It's something like Jee-Don...

06:58.889 --> 07:00.569
- ...or Joe-Don or--
- Jay-Don.

07:02.490 --> 07:05.120
That's it.
He's coming in for the meeting.

07:05.490 --> 07:07.069
They're picking him up.

07:08.490 --> 07:11.019
- Where?
- Downtown bus, midnight.

07:12.689 --> 07:15.920
- Hey, what am I gonna do?
- Take the meeting.

07:16.290 --> 07:20.430
- I'll get you out before it goes down.
- I owe you bigtime, cuz.

07:21.089 --> 07:24.209
Thank you, man. Nice to meet you.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.910
- So you know this Jay-Don?
- I know of him.

07:32.490 --> 07:34.490
He's a player and way dangerous.

07:34.889 --> 07:37.060
- I'll take it from here.
- You'll what?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.660
This is my cousin's life.

07:39.689 --> 07:42.990
Which is why I don't want you in
with guns a-blazing.

07:43.290 --> 07:45.819
- You're giving me orders?
- I'm paying you.

07:46.290 --> 07:47.620
I brought it to you.

07:48.089 --> 07:50.899
If I can't shut it down,
I'll protect him.

07:51.689 --> 07:54.920
- I should sit home and knit?
- I could use a sweater.

07:55.290 --> 07:56.689
Something dark.

08:25.810 --> 08:26.680
Darla?

08:27.009 --> 08:30.870
You expecting her? Because that
would cut down on my legwork.

08:33.009 --> 08:36.909
- What are you doing here?
- She was involved in a little murder.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.200
Remember? A guy's throat
got ripped out.

08:40.210 --> 08:42.669
I'm sure you'll tell me
she's innocent.

08:50.409 --> 08:51.529
Maybe not.

08:51.610 --> 08:54.769
Don't suppose you'd testify
in a sunny court of law.

08:55.809 --> 08:58.159
Don't suppose you got
a search warrant.

08:58.210 --> 09:00.490
Oh, I knew I forgot something.

09:03.009 --> 09:06.029
Darla's not here.
I don't know where she is.

09:06.610 --> 09:10.090
I will find her, Angel.
And when I do, she's toast.

09:10.809 --> 09:14.460
- She's human now, remember?
- Toast with life in prison.

09:17.409 --> 09:21.480
Kate, there are forces at work here
that you know nothing about.

09:22.210 --> 09:24.279
- Gathering storm?
- Don't get caught.

09:25.210 --> 09:28.620
- You afraid I'll get hurt?
- I'm afraid you'd get killed.

09:28.809 --> 09:30.559
I'm saying this so you won't.

09:31.210 --> 09:35.559
Me dead. I guess I'd kind of
be like you then, wouldn't I?

09:37.210 --> 09:40.049
I won't stand by
while you two finish the game.

09:40.210 --> 09:42.139
Let's try this one more time.

09:42.970 --> 09:45.669
You come between us,
it'll be your last move.

09:46.570 --> 09:48.289
Let go of me.

10:00.370 --> 10:02.759
Really, the stain's hardly noticeable.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.879
Cordelia, what happened?

10:05.169 --> 10:09.559
It's not blood, it's cocktail sauce.
Courtesy of Mr. Star-Schmoozer here.

10:10.570 --> 10:12.360
I mean to your head.

10:12.970 --> 10:14.440
Your hair.

10:15.370 --> 10:17.330
Well, it looks great.

10:17.769 --> 10:21.250
- When did this happen?
- Ten days ago. Pay attention.

10:22.809 --> 10:27.379
- Why doesn't anyone tell me this stuff?
- We had a little mishap.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.049
With the little shrimp and the sauce.

10:32.409 --> 10:34.940
- And her dress.
- You were at a party?

10:35.409 --> 10:39.409
You know, party, soiree,
night of the thousand humiliations.

10:41.409 --> 10:45.240
I spilled it on her
in front of Mr. Fat Chow-Chow.

10:48.009 --> 10:49.590
Chow Yun-Fat.

10:51.009 --> 10:52.830
What, you met Chow Yun-Fat?

10:54.009 --> 10:58.080
- How'd it go with Gunn's cousin?
- Fine. A group of-- Cordelia?

10:58.809 --> 11:00.320
Listening.

11:00.610 --> 11:03.940
A group of thieves is planning
to heist a local museum.

11:04.210 --> 11:06.980
Probably something
with mystical power.

11:07.809 --> 11:11.639
- Do you know which museum?
- No. Gunn's cousin is just the driver.

11:12.610 --> 11:15.799
We should research museums
with recent acquisitions.

11:16.210 --> 11:19.539
This is wonderful. You're on a case.

11:21.009 --> 11:22.450
You're back.

11:22.809 --> 11:24.879
It'll be just like old times.

11:25.809 --> 11:29.250
Meeting Evil face-to-face,
kicking Evil's booty.

11:30.009 --> 11:33.519
Wes and I will crank up
the research machine, and you'll--

11:36.009 --> 11:36.950
What'll you do?

11:37.210 --> 11:41.779
They're bringing Jay-Don in from
Vegas. If he's involved, it's big.

11:42.610 --> 11:45.700
- I've heard of him. Isn't he a--
- Deadly killer?

11:46.210 --> 11:49.759
Well, that. I was about to say
a loud, flashy character.

11:51.009 --> 11:54.240
He ran with Sinatra's Rat Pack.
Never got over it.

11:54.610 --> 11:58.509
- I think I'll meet his bus.
- And take his place? Great plan, boss!

12:02.409 --> 12:06.450
What better way to get your mind off
things we don't even need to--

12:09.009 --> 12:12.700
- How loud and flashy?
- I believe he's quite the extrovert.

12:18.610 --> 12:21.490
- What?
- Well, I'm sure you can pull it off.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.779
You're...colorful.

12:38.889 --> 12:42.120
This is such an honor.
Hi. I'm a big fan.

12:42.490 --> 12:46.320
When the boss said that Jay-Don
was coming in, I was like, wow!

12:47.289 --> 12:50.799
- Can I see the glasses?
- No touching them or the hair, doll.

12:51.490 --> 12:54.120
Yeah, right, doll. You got it.
That's cool.

12:54.490 --> 12:57.470
I'm supposed to ask you something.
What is it?

12:58.690 --> 13:00.200
Oh, God, what is it?

13:00.490 --> 13:01.399
Oh, yeah.

13:03.490 --> 13:06.049
- What's the password?
- There is no password.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.529
Just checking.

13:26.289 --> 13:30.639
- Jay-Don?
- You think I'm traveling in luggage?

13:32.289 --> 13:33.299
How you doing?

13:36.490 --> 13:40.700
You look sharp. That plastic surgeon,
he give you the big rebate?

13:41.889 --> 13:44.730
- Let's go. Car's over here.
- The trip was faboo.

13:44.889 --> 13:48.860
I love flying coach.
And what is that piece of junk?

13:50.889 --> 13:53.980
- You're funny, vampire.
- Whoa. We need to talk, bro.

13:54.490 --> 13:59.059
Two things bringing in the chicks:
the 'do and the ride.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.139
Get in.

14:02.889 --> 14:05.519
I hope I don't see anybody I know.

14:26.289 --> 14:27.200
He's got him.

14:34.690 --> 14:37.809
- Vampires wig me.
- You feel like a meal?

14:43.090 --> 14:45.860
You must be Bob, the security guard.

14:46.690 --> 14:50.340
- And you're a great big monster.
- This is Jay-Don.

14:52.690 --> 14:55.110
- He talks too much.
- I'm a people person.

14:55.690 --> 14:58.500
- Great shirt. Ed's Big and Spiny?
- You're funny.

14:59.289 --> 15:02.659
- You'll be funnier dead.
- Funny ha-ha or funny peculiar?

15:03.490 --> 15:05.769
- Shut up, all of you.
- I wasn't talking.

15:07.690 --> 15:11.870
- Where's Lester?
- Yeah. We can't do it without him.

15:12.490 --> 15:14.169
- Who's Lester?
- The driver.

15:16.690 --> 15:20.730
- He should've already been here.
- He's E.J.'s guy. He'll show.

15:22.090 --> 15:23.559
I hate waiting.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.769
You got anybody to eat around here?

15:33.490 --> 15:34.360
Finally.

15:34.690 --> 15:38.019
What kind of name is Lester anyway?
Norwegian? Finnish?

15:41.889 --> 15:45.509
- What took you so long?
- What took me so long is I'm a pro.

15:47.289 --> 15:50.309
I cased the area,
made sure no cops followed me.

15:50.889 --> 15:53.350
Looks like I'm the last one
at the party.

16:09.450 --> 16:12.009
- I said I'd handle it.
- I don't take orders.

16:12.450 --> 16:14.269
- Something wrong?
- Depends.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.590
Do we all gotta wear
these ugly-ass shirts?

16:17.850 --> 16:19.669
Because I got my pride.

16:20.850 --> 16:22.710
So, what we looking for?

16:23.250 --> 16:27.750
The Shroud of Rahmon. It's worth about
two million on the black market.

16:30.450 --> 16:34.169
- Do you want to pay attention now?
- You got my undivided.

16:35.850 --> 16:38.799
Bob turns off the alarm at 2:40.

16:39.450 --> 16:43.559
We enter, take this hall to the
elevator, where we meet Bob at 2:45...

16:44.250 --> 16:46.389
...and we all go down together.

16:48.450 --> 16:50.870
This is the vault where they keep it.

16:51.450 --> 16:53.450
The vault has a lock code.

16:54.450 --> 16:58.029
That means we have to blow it.
Now, the door has no alarm...

16:58.649 --> 17:02.159
...but the vault itself has its
own system, a thermal sensor.

17:02.850 --> 17:05.660
- Body heat sets it off.
- That's where I come in.

17:05.848 --> 17:08.380
No body heat.
Goes with the no soul thing.

17:08.848 --> 17:12.710
Jay-Don enters, goes to the control box
in the back, disarms it.

17:13.650 --> 17:15.608
- We're in.
- How big is the case?

17:16.049 --> 17:17.309
Big.

17:23.250 --> 17:27.819
It's made of consecrated wood with
gold edges and a lead-lined interior.

17:28.650 --> 17:33.220
It weighs about a ton. It's going
to take all of us just to lift it.

17:34.049 --> 17:37.029
I can handle my end.
I'm not so sure about him.

17:37.650 --> 17:40.140
- I can handle my side.
- With a forklift.

17:40.650 --> 17:43.000
- You want a piece of me?
- Take it easy.

17:43.049 --> 17:45.960
He's a troublemaker.
I know a Majnu demon...

17:46.650 --> 17:48.680
...professional driver, never talks.

17:49.650 --> 17:52.039
And I know a vampire better shut up.

17:52.650 --> 17:55.809
Guys, I apologize.
This is something I should just...

17:56.849 --> 17:58.460
...take outside!

17:58.529 --> 18:00.950
- I got a problem with that.
- So do I.

18:02.130 --> 18:04.730
I gotta spend the rest
of the week with him?

18:05.730 --> 18:07.829
No. Just the rest of the night.

18:08.730 --> 18:11.009
- No waiting. We do this now.
- Tonight?

18:11.730 --> 18:15.099
And no one leaves my sight
until it's over.

18:17.730 --> 18:21.799
Anybody tries, they get a bullet
from me or a stake from him.

18:24.450 --> 18:27.259
Museums, museums.
Okay, we've got the MOCA.

18:28.049 --> 18:31.630
We've got the LACMA.
Ooh, the Gene Autry!

18:32.250 --> 18:34.779
Well, it could be
a magical stuffed horse.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.880
Let's assume not
and try Natural History.

18:39.450 --> 18:43.769
Okay, here we go. Site map,
membership, museum shop....

18:44.849 --> 18:47.480
Don't they have
a "Things to Steal" section?

18:47.849 --> 18:50.099
Click on Recent Acquisitions. There.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.390
I've got it. Backseat surfer.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.529
- Where's Angel?
- Could be a long meeting.

18:55.650 --> 18:58.700
- Could it be chelicerae arthropods?
- Keep going.

19:01.049 --> 19:03.119
Wait. "On the 3rd of this month...

19:04.049 --> 19:06.579
...the museum received
the Shroud of Rahmon...

19:07.049 --> 19:10.630
...from a tomb unearthed
by New Mexico archaeologists."

19:11.250 --> 19:14.200
Okay, two words I don't like:
tomb and unearthed.

19:14.849 --> 19:18.819
- People, leave your tombs earthed.
- Have you ever heard of it?

19:19.650 --> 19:22.559
I don't like shrouds.
They're an after-you-die outfit.

19:23.250 --> 19:26.619
Get all you can from the database.
I'll hit the books.

19:50.410 --> 19:53.039
The driver should stay here
in case someone--

19:53.410 --> 19:55.089
We need him inside.

19:55.809 --> 19:58.269
- Don't hit me again.
- I was protecting you.

19:58.809 --> 20:00.490
I appreciate that.

20:01.210 --> 20:02.750
Don't do it again.

20:28.210 --> 20:31.119
We have one minute
before Earl makes his rounds.

20:31.809 --> 20:33.980
You don't have to hit him hard.

21:03.009 --> 21:04.410
They got me, Earl!

21:07.210 --> 21:11.420
You kill him, the cops will be
all over us. We gotta do this clean.

21:13.210 --> 21:14.400
Tape him.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.069
Let's go.

21:38.410 --> 21:41.150
Come on.
Come on, hurry up and blow it!

22:00.009 --> 22:02.819
He's a guard
at the Museum of Natural History.

22:03.009 --> 22:05.539
Robert Skale.
He has a record. Small-timer.

22:06.609 --> 22:10.470
This one may be M. James Menlo.
He likes to crack bank vaults.

22:10.809 --> 22:14.250
Our guess is they're pulling
a heist at the museum.

22:15.009 --> 22:17.289
Then we picked up this one tonight.

22:18.009 --> 22:20.180
Carlson said you knew him.

22:21.009 --> 22:25.359
It's not within our investigation,
but Carlson said you'd be interested.

22:27.009 --> 22:28.519
I'm interested.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.450
You're taking too long!

22:40.809 --> 22:45.160
Spine-Man, chill. This is nitro.
I don't want our body parts mixed up.

22:46.210 --> 22:48.809
- We should've been in there by now.
- Shut up!

22:54.009 --> 22:55.380
Allow me.

23:19.289 --> 23:23.259
The shroud was woven by the head
priest, driven mad by the demon.

23:24.089 --> 23:26.900
Once Rahmon was defeated,
the shroud was dyed...

23:27.690 --> 23:30.920
...with the blood of seven virgins,
sacrificed on the full moon...

23:31.289 --> 23:34.730
...then laid upon Rahmon,
to prevent his resurrection.

23:35.490 --> 23:39.000
Why is it always virgin women
who are sacrificed?

23:39.690 --> 23:42.390
- For purity.
- It has nothing to do with purity.

23:42.690 --> 23:44.299
It's about dominance.

23:45.089 --> 23:48.740
If someone ordered a male body part
for religious sacrifice...

23:49.289 --> 23:52.200
...the world would be
atheist, like that.

23:54.690 --> 23:57.670
The shroud supposedly
absorbed Rahmon's power.

23:58.289 --> 24:00.890
So he who has the shroud
has the power.

24:01.289 --> 24:03.890
You said Rahmon was
a drive-you-mad kind of fella?

24:04.289 --> 24:04.920
Ooh.

24:05.490 --> 24:07.309
I hate it when you do that.

24:08.490 --> 24:11.400
In 1803, the shroud
was removed from its casing.

24:12.089 --> 24:13.670
- And yuckiness ensued?
- Yes.

24:14.490 --> 24:17.089
All of El Encanto went insane.

24:17.490 --> 24:21.630
Mothers and children hacking each
other, men roaming like rabid dogs--

24:22.289 --> 24:23.799
I get the picture.

24:24.089 --> 24:27.390
In order to take his mind off
the torment that is Darla...

24:28.289 --> 24:31.940
...we sent Angel after a box
that makes you crazy.

24:32.490 --> 24:35.470
We'll warn Angel
before they steal the shroud.

24:36.089 --> 24:38.190
Just as soon as he comes back.

24:40.289 --> 24:43.619
Unless, of course,
they're stealing it right now.

25:07.890 --> 25:10.869
The shroud's gonna make us rich.
I can feel it.

25:11.490 --> 25:13.910
You feel it? This is gonna be amazing.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.539
How's it going in there?
Is everything all right?

25:36.089 --> 25:37.559
Everything's fine.

26:00.809 --> 26:04.809
- I feel something weird in here.
- Humans always gotta feel something.

26:05.609 --> 26:08.210
They always gotta tell you,
"I'm so happy.

26:08.609 --> 26:11.309
I'm so sad. I'm so scared."
It makes me sick.

26:12.210 --> 26:15.619
I like it when they're scared.
It makes them taste salty.

26:15.809 --> 26:18.549
I ask for your opinion,
you overgrown leech?

26:19.410 --> 26:22.500
- Altoids, aisle four.
- We don't have time for this.

26:23.009 --> 26:26.660
- Let's get it and go.
- When they gonna make pretty demons?

26:27.210 --> 26:28.579
On the count of three.

26:31.410 --> 26:33.200
- One.
- You about to turn or something?

26:33.809 --> 26:34.369
No.

26:34.410 --> 26:35.599
- Two.
- You look like it.

26:36.210 --> 26:38.380
- Lift, Lester.
- Don't order me, Elvis.

26:39.210 --> 26:40.079
Three!

26:41.609 --> 26:45.160
So it is tonight.
They must be somewhere...

26:45.809 --> 26:47.140
...inside.

26:47.609 --> 26:49.859
Sorry, I'm feeling a little....

26:50.609 --> 26:53.210
Me too. I think it's the altitude.

26:53.609 --> 26:56.559
Right. The altitude here at sea level.

26:59.009 --> 27:02.269
- Let's not lose focus.
- Maybe we should split up.

27:03.210 --> 27:06.720
- Too dangerous. Let's stick together.
- Right.

27:07.410 --> 27:09.130
Lockley requesting backup.

27:09.809 --> 27:13.779
Possible 459 in progress
at the Museum of Natural History.

27:24.210 --> 27:27.160
- Hold up your corner.
- Who made you corner monitor?

27:27.809 --> 27:30.059
- You gonna get married?
- Same old story.

27:30.210 --> 27:32.880
Pushy vampires,
think the world is theirs.

27:33.809 --> 27:36.509
- They can have it.
- I visited Topkapi once.

27:36.809 --> 27:39.130
Always taking.
Your blood, your sister.

27:39.809 --> 27:42.759
- Somebody shut that human up!
- Wanna take somebody?

27:44.609 --> 27:46.500
- Try taking me!
- It's slipping!

27:47.009 --> 27:49.220
- Don't drop it!
- Hold it, hold it!

27:51.210 --> 27:51.839
Oops.

27:53.009 --> 27:55.680
I hate this
vampires-killed-my-sister song.

27:56.009 --> 27:57.869
Don't you know anything else?

27:58.410 --> 28:02.549
- Get your hands off my throat.
- You gonna play nice?

28:05.609 --> 28:08.869
- I'm cool.
- We can't leave it. We must move it.

28:09.210 --> 28:11.529
Someone else will come along. Move it!

28:15.809 --> 28:17.599
Kill the human! Kill it!

28:27.210 --> 28:28.369
Case.

28:29.009 --> 28:31.990
All righty, pardners,
it's roping time!

28:32.609 --> 28:36.579
I'll play the defenseless calf.
Who gets to be the cowboy?

28:38.009 --> 28:42.079
Tightly, so it looks real.
I'm not the bad guy, I'm the good guy.

28:42.809 --> 28:45.720
I'm the good guy.
No, wait. The bad guy.

28:46.410 --> 28:49.220
- Pick it up.
- Wait. You gotta hit me.

28:51.210 --> 28:54.049
Somebody's gotta hit me.
Man, you gotta hit me.

28:54.809 --> 28:56.460
Do it. Make it real.

29:00.809 --> 29:02.880
Looks real to me.

29:26.970 --> 29:28.509
Where's Angel?

29:28.769 --> 29:29.470
Angel?

29:31.170 --> 29:34.819
Right. That's why I'm here.
To warn Angel about...

29:35.369 --> 29:36.769
...something...

29:37.769 --> 29:39.140
...important.

29:39.569 --> 29:40.940
Your hair.

29:43.170 --> 29:46.009
- To warn Angel about my hair?
- It's blond.

29:50.369 --> 29:51.630
The shroud.

29:53.369 --> 29:57.549
He's got to know about the shroud.
It makes everyone act differently.

29:59.970 --> 30:04.109
My teeth are so big.

30:06.569 --> 30:07.730
I...

30:08.369 --> 30:09.980
...am...

30:10.170 --> 30:12.589
...pleasant.

30:14.369 --> 30:16.579
We must hurry before it's too late.

30:17.970 --> 30:20.000
I noticed your hair right away.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.160
Oh.

30:40.769 --> 30:43.230
Hello, plastic person.

30:45.569 --> 30:48.200
You're all by your lonesome in here.

30:51.569 --> 30:52.940
So....

30:53.369 --> 30:56.529
I guess you won't be needing this.

31:07.769 --> 31:10.049
- We left fingerprints!
- What?

31:10.769 --> 31:13.160
- They'll find us!
- Forget him. Keep going.

31:13.170 --> 31:14.920
No fingerprints!

31:17.970 --> 31:20.430
I gotta put it down.
I gotta put it down.

31:20.970 --> 31:23.430
- Humans! Good for nothing!
- Keep going.

31:23.970 --> 31:27.589
I can't, I can't.
My head. It's full of flies.

31:32.369 --> 31:35.559
- Get away from it!
- I don't need any of you.

31:35.970 --> 31:39.200
What's wrong now, son?
Tired? Got a little backache?

31:40.170 --> 31:41.680
A little toothache?

31:43.170 --> 31:45.980
- What?
- Angel, thank God I found you...

31:48.569 --> 31:50.819
- ...in time. Is it in time?
- Wesley?

31:51.569 --> 31:54.619
Yes! I had a message for you.
And the message was....

31:56.369 --> 31:58.900
The shroud!
The shroud, very dangerous.

31:59.369 --> 32:03.200
It makes people bad, although
it's amazing how good I feel.

32:04.170 --> 32:06.940
- Get out.
- Is that Gunn? What's he doing here?

32:07.769 --> 32:11.390
- I never thought him a museum type.
- Police! Nobody move!

32:16.769 --> 32:17.470
Wow!

32:20.970 --> 32:23.740
Look at you, rushing in here
all by yourself.

32:23.970 --> 32:26.529
- You're the best cop ever.
- Too many humans.

32:26.970 --> 32:29.289
- Excuse me, this is my girl.
- Stay back.

32:29.970 --> 32:30.769
Okay.

32:31.769 --> 32:34.789
You got me. My life of crime is over.

32:35.369 --> 32:38.740
I'm going down.
But first, a little impression.

32:38.970 --> 32:40.829
"I protect the innocent...

32:41.369 --> 32:44.630
...rain on everyone's parade,
obsess about my dad's death...

32:45.569 --> 32:47.359
...and bother people
who steal things!"

32:47.970 --> 32:49.299
Angel.

32:53.970 --> 32:57.299
Oh, Katie, what are you so afraid of?

32:58.769 --> 33:00.349
Is it this?

33:02.369 --> 33:05.700
Is it the part where I kill you?
I love that in a woman.

33:35.450 --> 33:37.339
Don't move! Police!

33:37.849 --> 33:41.400
- Oh, I didn't--
- Don't move. Stay where you are.

33:45.049 --> 33:48.670
- Oh, my God.
- Kate. Come on, wake up.

33:49.849 --> 33:52.619
- We got an officer down.
- What's your 20?

34:19.250 --> 34:20.789
You drank her.

34:21.650 --> 34:23.369
Animal! You drank that cop.

34:25.849 --> 34:26.929
- What now?
- Open it.

34:27.050 --> 34:31.369
Good thing we didn't do that in the
museum and miss out on the lifting.

34:32.449 --> 34:34.518
Open it! There's a catch.

34:40.849 --> 34:42.530
That works too.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.920
I got it. I got it!

35:04.849 --> 35:05.829
No! No!

35:07.250 --> 35:10.730
You don't know what this means,
what it's about.

35:11.449 --> 35:14.050
It belongs to my people. My people!

35:14.449 --> 35:17.710
I didn't see any of your people
when we was hauling it.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.510
Fellas, fellas.

35:21.050 --> 35:24.280
Cool your jets, okay.
There's plenty here for all of...

35:25.250 --> 35:26.119
...me.

35:28.849 --> 35:32.150
How's it work? The one with
the biggest piece gets a wish?

35:32.449 --> 35:34.239
- Don't hurt it.
- What about you?

35:34.849 --> 35:36.949
- You want it?
- I get it, I kill you.

35:37.250 --> 35:40.340
Tell your wish,
because it won't come true.

36:01.250 --> 36:02.619
It's mine!

36:08.449 --> 36:10.590
Got it! Got it! Got it!

36:12.650 --> 36:16.199
Wait, wait. Gunn, I remember.
You have to trust me.

36:16.849 --> 36:18.639
I know what to do with this.

36:20.449 --> 36:21.960
I think.

37:10.130 --> 37:13.889
- You want us to believe a magic sheet--
- A shroud! A shroud.

37:14.610 --> 37:16.289
Right, right.

37:17.010 --> 37:19.820
It turns people
into superstrong lunatics?

37:21.809 --> 37:24.059
So one ripped the head off a guard...

37:24.809 --> 37:27.719
...and another viciously
attacked Detective Lockley.

37:28.409 --> 37:30.269
- That it?
- I know how it sounds.

37:30.809 --> 37:33.130
I really don't think you do.

37:37.730 --> 37:40.570
- What are you doing?
- Arresting you.

37:41.929 --> 37:44.840
For the murder of the guard
and the attempted--

37:48.530 --> 37:49.789
Let him go.

38:30.530 --> 38:32.599
Stay down or they'll kill you.

39:09.210 --> 39:11.239
I don't think he's coming down.

39:11.610 --> 39:12.449
Mm.

39:14.010 --> 39:16.960
I don't think recent events
did him much good.

39:17.610 --> 39:20.590
Again, a hearty "mm."

39:21.809 --> 39:24.130
We had every good intention,
of course.

39:24.210 --> 39:27.260
Right. Sending him into the path
of a crazy-making...

39:27.809 --> 39:31.320
...one-way ticket to Eviltown
death cloth. Good plan.

39:33.210 --> 39:35.630
I'm not as worried about
the shroud's effects as--

39:36.210 --> 39:37.579
What?

39:38.010 --> 39:41.489
My stealing?
I returned everything, I swear.

39:44.010 --> 39:47.340
Angel drank human blood
from a living person.

39:48.210 --> 39:50.460
He hasn't done that in a long time.

39:51.210 --> 39:54.860
So on top of everything else, we may
have reawakened his bloodlust?

39:55.409 --> 39:56.210
Yes.

40:01.409 --> 40:04.179
- Full day's work, then.
- I think so.

41:14.010 --> 41:14.920
Thank you,

41:15.305 --> 41:21.862
