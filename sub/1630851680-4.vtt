There's so much good shit
on the Waystar raid.

00:18.708 --> 00:19.916

Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

Totally.

-What's up?
-Uh, no, nothing. Um...

00:48.541 --> 00:49.750

00:59.041 --> 01:00.541
I have this, like, stupid worry

01:00.625 --> 01:02.500
that I'm gonna go over

01:02.583 --> 01:05.333
and there will be, like, goons
and stooges

01:05.416 --> 01:08.250
and rough-jacks there
to administer a beating.

01:08.333 --> 01:11.708
Well, honestly, he'll try to
turn you against me.

01:12.708 --> 01:13.708
Right?

01:13.791 --> 01:16.000
-GREG: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-And that's fine.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.666
Because you're not
gonna turn against me.

01:18.750 --> 01:20.125
No, no, no. No!

01:20.208 --> 01:21.583
-No way!
-Are you gonna turn against me?

01:21.666 --> 01:24.791
No way, man. I'm sturdy!

01:24.875 --> 01:27.833
-I'm a sturdy... birdy.

Yeah, the temperature of the DOJ
investigation, the raid here,

04:41.125 --> 04:43.875
it's caused serious
blowback from investors.

04:43.958 --> 04:45.583

And noisily.

05:01.125 --> 05:04.000
His fingers on
the big red button, Ken.

05:04.083 --> 05:06.708
We've talked to him
about what we can do

05:06.791 --> 05:08.208
and he's playing hard to get.

05:08.291 --> 05:09.500
But...

05:09.583 --> 05:13.708
he was interested in time in
the room with you and your dad.

05:13.791 --> 05:14.833
Together?

05:15.208 --> 05:16.291
No.

05:16.375 --> 05:19.000
Yeah, his thing was, I guess,
to know how this goes.

05:19.083 --> 05:21.000
He wants his
pound of flesh, all right?

05:21.083 --> 05:22.875
GERRI:<i> Uh, Kendall,</i>
<i>he just wants to make sure</i>

05:22.958 --> 05:25.166

05:25.250 --> 05:28.166
Yeah, well, obviously,
I can't meet jointly with Dad.

05:28.250 --> 05:31.583
It's just a half hour
in a lawyer's office later.

05:31.666 --> 05:34.750
Kendall, we are four days out
from the shareholder meeting.

05:34.833 --> 05:38.041
KARL MULLER:<i> Kendall, it's about</i>
<i>control of the company,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

05:38.125 --> 05:40.250
The vote is on a razor's edge.

05:40.333 --> 05:41.958
We need his four percent.

05:42.041 --> 05:45.125
Unless you think that any of us
would have a bright future

05:45.208 --> 05:47.833
<i>with Sandy and Stewy</i>
<i>in control of the firm.</i>

05:48.833 --> 05:52.541
So, um, he's suggesting
in four hours...

05:52.625 --> 05:55.083
No, no, no. No!
You don't railroad me. No.

05:55.166 --> 05:56.625
I need to run this by my team.

05:56.708 --> 05:59.833
Me and Dad together,
the optics are janky as fuck.

05:59.916 --> 06:02.708
Come! Behave appropriately!

06:02.791 --> 06:04.166
KENDALL:<i> Oh, hey, Dad!</i>

06:04.250 --> 06:06.875
Come on, when have I ever
not behaved appropriately?

06:06.958 --> 06:08.708
<i>This just doesn't work for me.</i>

06:08.791 --> 06:11.500

06:24.041 --> 06:25.083
how bad is it?

06:26.833 --> 06:30.083
Well, I'm hearing that the raid
was just a warning shot.

06:30.166 --> 06:32.708
So, things should
settle down now.

06:32.791 --> 06:34.458
I think I need more people.

06:35.208 --> 06:36.250
More protection.

06:36.333 --> 06:38.625
Dad, you have
two former Deputy AG's

06:38.708 --> 06:40.416
and the ex-head of Fraud
at Main Justice.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.083
These are
the Harlem Globetrotters,

06:42.166 --> 06:43.750
the Westchester Judge-fuckers.

06:43.833 --> 06:46.333
The Raisin owes me everything.

06:46.416 --> 06:48.583
And now I need
a bit of fucking cover,

06:48.666 --> 06:51.375
the forgetful cunt's gone AWOL.

06:51.458 --> 06:55.000
I think perhaps, we have been
insufficiently rigorous,

06:55.083 --> 06:58.083
journalistically,
on the President.

06:58.166 --> 07:00.500
You think he'll respond well
to a little bit of pressure?

07:00.583 --> 07:03.000
Well, every time I call
Michelle-Anne, she tells me,

07:03.083 --> 07:04.166
"Be patient!

07:04.916 --> 07:06.375
The cavalry is coming!"

07:06.958 --> 07:08.250
I need leverage.

07:09.041 --> 07:10.916
I have Connor, again.

07:11.416 --> 07:13.000
See? See?

07:13.083 --> 07:14.250
I'm in a corner.

07:14.333 --> 07:15.500
Everyone wants a piece.

07:15.583 --> 07:18.666
Everyone's out of their box.
Everything's coming up fuck.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.750
I want you on fire-watch, okay?

07:20.833 --> 07:23.458
Yeah, okay, Dad. Absolutely.

07:23.541 --> 07:26.833
And, uh, watch the negotiations.

07:26.916 --> 07:31.000
Karl's a smart bastard
but, uh, he likes to be liked.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.166
-Not good.
-Got it.

07:37.583 --> 07:40.375
Okay, so can we strategize?
I got potential gold here.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.208
But I need your read
on how to deploy.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.750
Roman, could you please
put your footwear on?

07:44.833 --> 07:48.375
Uh, see, for this to work,
we need, you know, boundaries.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.708
-And--
-What, I can't take
my footwear off?

07:50.791 --> 07:52.041
Well, it's just--

07:52.125 --> 07:54.583
What, I can't masturbate in
a time and place of my choosing?

07:54.666 --> 07:55.875
-See that?
-You are building...

07:55.958 --> 07:57.041
-That will kill us.
-...a police state here, Gerri.

07:57.125 --> 07:58.208
I found tattoo man.

07:58.291 --> 07:59.625
-"Tattoo man"?
-ROMAN ROY: Yup.

07:59.708 --> 08:02.916
Funny little story.
So, about fifteen-ish years ago,

08:03.000 --> 08:04.333
Kendall's bachelor party
in New Orleans,

08:04.416 --> 08:05.833
we did this, like...

08:05.916 --> 08:09.166
ironic bar crawl thing
on Bourbon Street.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.166
And we got chatting
with this, you know,

08:11.916 --> 08:13.750
friendly hobo.

08:13.833 --> 08:16.583
And there was talk of,
you know, various...

08:16.666 --> 08:19.625
disgusting endeavors
like, you know,

08:19.708 --> 08:21.708
"Would the hobo eat
a deep-fried deck shoe?"

08:21.791 --> 08:24.083
(FAKE LAUGHS) You know, stupid,
whatever, bullshit.

08:24.166 --> 08:26.166
Before we settled on a rather...

08:26.250 --> 08:29.250
indecent proposal
which was to...

08:29.333 --> 08:31.125
get the homeless man to have

08:31.208 --> 08:33.750
Kendall's name tattooed
on his forehead.

08:33.833 --> 08:34.916
What?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.916
Yeah, we got Kendall's initials
tattooed on a rando.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.416
And you think this is
a good idea to dredge this up?

08:40.500 --> 08:42.500
On Kendall? Woke-ahontas?

08:42.583 --> 08:44.958
Using a poor's forehead
as a Post-It?

08:45.041 --> 08:46.583
It's fucking killer,
are you kidding me?

08:46.666 --> 08:48.041
Well, I'm not so sure.

08:48.125 --> 08:50.791
Okay, well, we can talk about it
over lunch, maybe?

08:50.875 --> 08:53.291
Uh, not today, Roman,
I have a date.

08:53.375 --> 08:55.583
Fuck off! With who?
Montgomery Clift?

08:55.666 --> 08:57.416
-The Ghost of Christmas Past?
-GERRI: Laurie.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.750
-Who?
-Laurie.

08:58.833 --> 09:00.166
He's ex-DOJ.

09:00.250 --> 09:02.833
He worked
the Arthur Anderson prosecution.

09:02.916 --> 09:04.958
I want to see if there's
a back channel there.

09:05.041 --> 09:06.125
ROMAN: Laurie?

09:06.208 --> 09:07.625
And you said he wants to

09:07.708 --> 09:09.458
back-channel you
in the parking lot or--

09:09.541 --> 09:11.375
Yeah, so, the thing is,
I'm dating.

09:11.458 --> 09:14.291
I am dating
and that needs to be understood.

09:14.375 --> 09:15.791
Okay, I get it. Yeah, yeah.

09:15.875 --> 09:17.583
You're drawing a line.

09:17.666 --> 09:19.250
Or otherwise, you know...

09:19.333 --> 09:21.958
Laurie will knock my
jolly old block off.

09:22.041 --> 09:23.250
If he can...

09:23.333 --> 09:27.625
find his sword stick and fire up
his motorized bath chair.

09:29.625 --> 09:30.625
All right.

09:37.291 --> 09:38.750
GREG: Good morning!

09:39.583 --> 09:41.291
LOGAN: Ah!

09:42.166 --> 09:43.333
Greg.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.333
Drink.

09:45.416 --> 09:48.083
-Uh, alcohol?
-Uh-huh.

09:48.166 --> 09:49.208
Um...

09:49.666 --> 09:50.625
sure, I--

09:50.708 --> 09:52.000
It's early but I--

09:52.083 --> 09:56.208
Yeah, I think I'll actually have
me a nice glass of rum and coke.

09:57.125 --> 09:58.125
Kerry!

09:59.208 --> 10:02.166
Can we bring, uh, Greg
some Coca-Cola?

10:02.250 --> 10:03.333
No, it's fine really.

10:03.416 --> 10:05.333
-Uh, she doesn't have to--
-LOGAN: No, no, no.

10:05.416 --> 10:08.958
What Greg wants... (EXHALES)
...Greg must have.

10:09.041 --> 10:13.291
Thank you. Like, so kind.
Ridicu-- I don't know.

10:13.666 --> 10:15.458
Uh...

10:15.541 --> 10:18.625
You and Kendall
have been hanging around a lot.

10:18.708 --> 10:19.750
Correct?

10:19.833 --> 10:21.416
I am, um...

10:21.500 --> 10:23.458
It's purely social, you know.

10:23.541 --> 10:26.625
The thing is
your position at Waystar...

10:26.708 --> 10:31.000
could become complicated if you
get too associated with him.

10:31.416 --> 10:32.416
Hmm?

10:33.291 --> 10:35.541
-You can see that?
-(GROANS)

you've probably never
done this before.

10:49.125 --> 10:53.666

all very, very concerned.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.583

11:31.333 --> 11:32.541

11:57.875 --> 12:00.916

21:43.125 --> 21:44.166
-(JOSH SIGHS)
-How's Kitty?

21:44.250 --> 21:46.541
She's, uh, good. Better.
It was dumb.

21:46.625 --> 21:48.250
She had a fever this morning.

21:48.333 --> 21:49.500
-But, um...
-Fuck.

21:49.583 --> 21:51.708
...I just didn't wanna
come into the city.

21:51.791 --> 21:53.250
I hope that's okay?

21:53.333 --> 21:55.083
How's your, uh... Iverson?

21:55.166 --> 21:56.500
-Yeah, great. Great.
-Yeah?

21:56.583 --> 21:58.916
I just bought him
a fucking giant rabbit.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.041
So, now he's, like, Googling

22:00.125 --> 22:01.708
where he can buy
the world's biggest carrot.

22:01.791 --> 22:03.083
(BOTH LAUGH)

22:03.166 --> 22:04.875
-That's fucking hilarious.
-It's good.

22:04.958 --> 22:06.750
(LAUGHS) Hilarious.

22:06.833 --> 22:08.875
-Come outside. Take a look.
-Yeah.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.291
-KENDALL: Nice spot.
-JOSH AARONSON: Yeah.

22:12.375 --> 22:14.625
(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

22:14.708 --> 22:15.916
So, where's the big man?

22:17.000 --> 22:19.750
Ah, it's all good.
He-- he had to take a call.

22:19.833 --> 22:20.958
He sent me ahead.

22:24.416 --> 22:25.458
It's all good?

22:27.208 --> 22:28.125
I don't know. Sure.

22:28.208 --> 22:29.958
It's all terrible.
It's all good.

22:30.583 --> 22:31.791
You know. Whatever.

22:31.875 --> 22:32.958
(CHUCKLES) Right?

22:33.041 --> 22:35.416
I don't know. I guess
that's my whole question.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.583
We should probably wait
for the old man.

22:39.416 --> 22:41.333
But yeah, look, it's a fuck-pie.

22:41.416 --> 22:43.291
But end of the day,
it's not that complicated.

22:44.125 --> 22:46.708
Like, I'm better than my dad.

22:46.791 --> 22:49.666
But my dad is still better
than Sandy and Stewy.

22:50.958 --> 22:54.750
Yeah. My other option is,
I... just get out.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.750
Well...

22:59.500 --> 23:00.875
the comet is coming.

23:01.958 --> 23:04.291
-Mm-hmm?
-I think a single acquisition.

23:04.375 --> 23:06.333

23:06.416 --> 23:10.208

super app dinges.

23:11.375 --> 23:13.458
-We buy GoJo.
-Uh-huh.

23:13.541 --> 23:16.916
-It's a little overpriced.
-KENDALL: I don't know.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.083
Great UI, shitty content,
meet shitty UI, great content.

23:21.125 --> 23:22.125
Mm...

23:24.458 --> 23:27.041
You know, I like you.
Outside of all this, I really...

23:27.125 --> 23:29.875
-I really like you.
-I like you too, pal.

23:29.958 --> 23:32.500
Big fucking nervous breakdown
of a party for my fortieth.

23:32.583 --> 23:34.250
-You gotta come.
-Yeah, who's going?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.041
What, you need the list?

23:37.125 --> 23:40.166
You, me, and Henry Kissinger!
Fuck you! I know everybody.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.333
It's gonna be the bomb.

JOSH: I think she will be fine.

23:54.458 --> 23:56.916
Hey, thanks for, uh,
coming all this way.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.208
Oh, not at all.
I know what it's like.

23:59.291 --> 24:00.541
JOSH: Yeah, thanks.

24:05.750 --> 24:06.750
So...

24:07.541 --> 24:09.083
Hmm?

24:09.166 --> 24:11.125
-Hello, son.
-Hey, Dad.

24:22.833 --> 24:24.541
-Grab a seat.
-Hmm.

24:25.166 --> 24:26.625
So, uh... (CHUCKLES)

24:28.291 --> 24:30.666
(CLEARS THROAT)
Sorry for all this.

24:31.750 --> 24:33.875
Look, I know
you're pressed for time.

24:33.958 --> 24:37.375
I just wanted to, uh, check in.

24:37.458 --> 24:41.416
As an investor,
but, uh, you know, also as a...

24:42.708 --> 24:43.958
as a friend.

24:44.791 --> 24:47.166
You know, I guess
I have concerns.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.333
Let me tell you, hand on heart.

24:49.416 --> 24:51.833
Whatever the turbulence
in the short term,

24:51.916 --> 24:55.333
there is nothing
that's a significant issue.

24:55.416 --> 24:57.000
The core business
is the core business

24:57.083 --> 24:59.958
and the volatility
is priced in now.

25:00.041 --> 25:02.833
So, it's all upside from here.

25:02.916 --> 25:06.208
Safest option,
back me, sit tight,

25:06.291 --> 25:08.958

in your castle here,

25:09.041 --> 25:12.541
and I'll make you whole.

25:13.541 --> 25:14.541
Okay?

25:17.083 --> 25:20.375
No, it doesn't work like that.
Can we take a walk?

25:20.458 --> 25:23.750
(CHUCKLES) Look at
this fucking New York wiseacre.

25:23.833 --> 25:24.958
No, seriously, come on.

25:25.041 --> 25:27.458
It's so beautiful,
it's disgusting. I mean...

25:27.875 --> 25:28.833
A walk?

25:28.916 --> 25:30.416
-JOSH: Yeah.
-How far?

25:31.458 --> 25:32.750
Come on, Dad. Let's walk it out.

25:33.958 --> 25:35.208
JOSH: Yeah?

25:35.291 --> 25:38.333
Shall I send the cart for you,
or shall we walk?

25:38.416 --> 25:40.416
Sure! Let's walk.

25:41.583 --> 25:44.416
Good, good. Nice! Love it!

come out to dance with me.

25:47.375 --> 25:48.833

-Hey! Hey, man.

-Hi.
-ROMAN: How, uh--

26:23.666 --> 26:25.208
How you doing?
You look great.

26:25.291 --> 26:26.541
-Thank you.
-Hi.

26:26.625 --> 26:28.666
Good to see you again.

26:28.750 --> 26:30.833
What? Oh, yeah, no.
Good to...

26:30.916 --> 26:33.041
Good to see you too.
It's good to catch up, um...

26:34.083 --> 26:35.250
You never call!

-Hugo, do you wanna?
-Yes.

26:37.916 --> 26:40.333

to Mr. Albescu.

Is this an NDA situation?

26:46.125 --> 26:49.958
Sorry, but, uh, I'm not trying
to be a dick here.

26:50.041 --> 26:52.250
But, uh, I'm looking. And, um--

26:52.333 --> 26:53.916
Yeah, I'm just gonna say.
You're the--

26:54.000 --> 26:56.041

-Huh.

27:07.541 --> 27:10.375
improve employment potential
and social acceptability.

27:10.458 --> 27:11.875
Mm-hmm. Well...

27:12.833 --> 27:13.875
that's a shame.

27:13.958 --> 27:15.833
I mean, I think you really
had something there.

27:15.916 --> 27:17.541
It was really working for you.

27:17.625 --> 27:19.750
Uh, sorry, can I just?

27:20.625 --> 27:21.625
Do you mind?

27:23.000 --> 27:24.041
Okay.

-Hugo? Could you?
-Yeah, uh...

27:29.833 --> 27:30.916
-So...
-Excuse me.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.625
...you can sort of see it,
right?

I can make out the "R" here.

like a "K" to you?

if you had any photos.

27:58.166 --> 28:00.250
Yeah, I'm not super proud
of what I did.

28:00.333 --> 28:03.083
So, wouldn't want
any photos of it out there.

28:03.166 --> 28:07.041
Right, that makes sense.
And not wishing to...

28:07.125 --> 28:10.208
uh, make this too
transactional, but...

28:10.291 --> 28:12.208
how much for the photos?

going backwards.

what you want.

and we can fuck off.

or a power bar, or something?

to get into this.

to get it back.

29:16.541 --> 29:18.958
are you or Sandy
gonna get me that back?

31:40.791 --> 31:42.916
And here's me, going to jail.

31:44.083 --> 31:46.250
And you're gonna be
living in a magical castle.

31:46.333 --> 31:48.750
And I am going to be
down in a dungeon

31:48.833 --> 31:52.625
somewhere, sucking off ogres
for phone cards. (LAUGHS)

31:52.708 --> 31:55.458
No, I mean, who even knows?
This probably won't work--

31:55.541 --> 31:57.291
Greg what do you
know about, um...

31:58.166 --> 32:00.000
Nero and Sporus?

32:00.083 --> 32:01.833
Nero and...

32:01.916 --> 32:03.000
TOM: Sporus.

32:03.083 --> 32:04.416
-Spor--
-TOM: Greg, yeah.

32:05.833 --> 32:08.458
Sporus was a young slave boy.

32:09.291 --> 32:10.916
He was Nero's favorite.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
And, uh...

32:12.083 --> 32:13.583
you know what Nero did to him?

32:13.666 --> 32:15.333
"Nero and Sporus". I don't--

32:15.416 --> 32:17.208
This is not IP
I'm familiar with.

32:17.291 --> 32:19.208
Well, Nero...

32:20.416 --> 32:21.708
pushed his wife...

32:22.458 --> 32:24.291
down the stairs.

32:24.375 --> 32:29.333
And then he had Sporus castrated
and he married him instead.

32:29.416 --> 32:30.958
And he gave him a ring.

32:31.041 --> 32:33.458
And he made him dress up
like his dead wife.

32:33.791 --> 32:35.375
Wow!

32:35.458 --> 32:37.166
Plot twist!
Didn't see that coming.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.625
Yeah, I bought a book on
the Romans to read in prison.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.833
-It's a big book.
Well, is it a good book?

32:41.916 --> 32:43.250
TOM: It's a decent book, yeah.

32:45.958 --> 32:48.125
I'd castrate you
and marry you in a heartbeat.

32:49.250 --> 32:50.250
(CHUCKLES)

32:54.875 --> 32:56.166
(CLICKS TONGUE)

32:58.291 --> 33:00.041
-Are you okay, Tom?
-Hey!

33:00.125 --> 33:01.958
See if you can wrestle me
into the ground, Greg.

33:02.041 --> 33:03.000
-No.
-TOM: Come on.

33:03.083 --> 33:04.250
-I don't want to--
-Come on. Let's--

33:04.333 --> 33:05.500
Come on,
let's fight like chickens.

33:05.583 --> 33:06.875
-GREG: No, I--
-(IMITATES CHICKEN) Come on!

33:06.958 --> 33:09.833
Come on! Come on. Let's have
a little punching match.

33:09.916 --> 33:11.416
-No, no.
-(TOM CLUCKING)

33:11.500 --> 33:13.833
Come on! Fight me
like a rooster, you weakling!

33:13.916 --> 33:16.125
-Please, Tom! Stop!
-Come on!

33:16.208 --> 33:18.000
-Stop. I don't want to, man!
-Why are you such a cock?

33:18.083 --> 33:19.666
I don't want to!

33:19.750 --> 33:21.333
I don't wanna do it!

33:21.416 --> 33:23.666
(MOCKS) "I don't wanna do it!
I don't wanna do it!
I don't wanna do it!"

33:25.458 --> 33:26.833
Neither do I, Greg!

33:29.333 --> 33:30.750
It was a joke, you idiot.

33:32.083 --> 33:33.791
You're so hard to riff with.

33:33.875 --> 33:37.708
I mean that is a big career
obstacle right there for you.

33:38.333 --> 33:39.333
Big!

33:39.958 --> 33:41.000
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

33:45.125 --> 33:46.208
Come on, man.

33:48.416 --> 33:50.083
Yeah, I guess the, uh...

33:51.250 --> 33:54.333
the actual easiest thing
for me would be, uh...

33:55.708 --> 33:57.666
you know, Kendall,

33:57.750 --> 34:00.708
probably isn't too late for you
to backpedal on all your shit

34:00.791 --> 34:02.708
and just, you know...

34:02.791 --> 34:05.958
say you were wrong or
just fuzzle it up, you know.

34:06.041 --> 34:08.666
Just back off and cool it down.

34:09.125 --> 34:10.083
Hmm?

34:10.166 --> 34:12.958
No, that's not possible.

34:13.041 --> 34:16.250
I wasn't wrong
and that destroys my reputation.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.708
You should listen to him, son.

34:25.333 --> 34:26.500
Is this what this is?

34:27.666 --> 34:29.041
-What is this?
-What?

34:29.125 --> 34:32.166
I've been brought out here to be
roughed up by the two of you?

34:32.250 --> 34:33.916
-Is that what this is?
-No, no, no, no, no.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.541
"Things just got out of hand.
You were mistaken.

34:36.625 --> 34:38.291
Things went too far."

34:38.375 --> 34:39.416
No, no way.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.541
Maybe just quiet down
a little bit, all right?

34:41.625 --> 34:42.958
You've made your point,
all right?

34:43.041 --> 34:44.750
Maybe just, you know...

34:44.833 --> 34:47.291
we could just close up
the outrage shop.

34:47.375 --> 34:49.375
Leave it for
the DOJ to investigate.

34:52.666 --> 34:54.166
Are you guys trying to
fuck me here?

34:54.250 --> 34:55.625
-Ken--
-KENDALL: I see this!

34:55.708 --> 34:56.875
Whoa, hey.

34:57.833 --> 34:59.333
Easy. Easy, friend.

34:59.416 --> 35:00.458
-All right.
-Let's go.

35:01.375 --> 35:03.541
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

35:08.750 --> 35:09.958
You okay, son?

35:12.250 --> 35:15.375
Some of those drugs you do
can make you paranoid.

35:15.458 --> 35:16.500
Is that right?

35:18.125 --> 35:22.625
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

35:27.083 --> 35:28.375
-Hey!
-FRANK: Hi. Hi.

35:28.458 --> 35:29.875
Any updates from Dad?

35:29.958 --> 35:32.666
(SCOFFS) Radio silence, so...

35:32.750 --> 35:34.958
either everything going
to plan or...

35:35.041 --> 35:37.083
-they've stabbed
each other to death.
-Uh-huh.

35:38.250 --> 35:40.958
And where are we at with
the Sandy and Stewy negotiation?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.625
KARL: Oh, um...

35:43.708 --> 35:44.750
Pardon me.

35:46.291 --> 35:47.625
Momentarily broken.

35:47.708 --> 35:48.875
Oh, yeah?

35:48.958 --> 35:50.916
Yeah, they're just grabbing
a quick bite while they wait on

35:51.000 --> 35:52.875
-the turnaround of the document.
-SHIV: Uh-huh.

35:54.583 --> 35:56.000
But in terms of the temperature?

35:56.083 --> 35:58.500
Uh, it's attritional, huh?

35:58.583 --> 36:00.541
-Yeah.
-SHIV: Oh, great.

36:00.625 --> 36:02.000
But just so I'm clear,

36:02.083 --> 36:04.208
we're hung up on what exactly?

36:04.291 --> 36:06.250
Well, the last, um...

36:06.916 --> 36:08.875
break-out session was

36:09.000 --> 36:12.041
some specifics about
the non-disparagement clause.

36:12.125 --> 36:13.166
We're still on that?

36:14.791 --> 36:17.958
I mean, don't we have bigger
things like the stand-still?

36:18.041 --> 36:19.416
KARL: Maybe, but...

36:19.500 --> 36:21.375
what we're really trying
to scope out here

36:21.458 --> 36:24.333
is if actually there
is a deal space?

36:24.416 --> 36:27.833
Sure, but do we have time?

36:28.833 --> 36:29.875
Or do we just send

36:29.958 --> 36:32.500
one of you two big-hitters
down there and...

36:32.583 --> 36:34.166
bang some heads together?

36:34.250 --> 36:35.750
Pull 'em out of the weeds, huh?

36:37.750 --> 36:38.875
Uh...

36:39.750 --> 36:41.041
It's an option. Sure.

36:41.458 --> 36:42.750
SHIV: Great!

36:42.833 --> 36:45.916
Okay, well, any big news
or vibrations...

36:47.166 --> 36:49.958
-let me know.
-We absolutely will.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.166
SHIV: Thanks, guys.

36:56.916 --> 36:58.166
JOSH: Ah, it's good, yeah?

36:58.875 --> 37:00.833
KENDALL: Yeah. It's great.

37:04.458 --> 37:05.625
Your dad's okay?

37:06.875 --> 37:08.291
Yeah, he's fine.

37:08.375 --> 37:11.166
So, uh, come on.
What do you have on him?

37:13.625 --> 37:14.958
You know, I'd really...

37:15.500 --> 37:16.708
rather not say.

37:16.791 --> 37:17.833
Legally.

37:17.916 --> 37:19.541
I mean, I guess
it's difficult, right?

37:19.625 --> 37:23.041
I mean, if you have jack-shit
you look like a fake.

37:23.125 --> 37:25.083
If you have really damaging
shit, you make me

37:25.166 --> 37:27.000
maybe want to run away, right?

37:28.333 --> 37:30.500
-Well, he's implicated.
-Uh-huh.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.541
Hey.

37:35.583 --> 37:37.916
-Just riffing.
-Uh-huh, uh-huh.

-Hey!

37:51.416 --> 37:54.958
Yeah, so,
it's a no on Ravenhead.

37:55.041 --> 37:56.208
-SHIV: Oh?
-Yeah.

37:56.291 --> 37:58.541
He just doesn't see how
he can accommodate the pivot.

37:58.625 --> 37:59.583
Huh.

37:59.666 --> 38:01.791
-Well, that's unfortunate.
-TOM: Yeah.

38:01.875 --> 38:04.333
Yeah, he was fairly unpleasant
about it all.

38:04.416 --> 38:08.416
Uh-huh? But I heard that...
Greg's a lock.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.583
-Yeah? He signed the JDA, so...
-TOM: Uh...

38:12.375 --> 38:13.750
-You nailed that.
-TOM: Yeah.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.208
That's about my level.

38:15.291 --> 38:18.791

minion wrangler and shit-eater.

38:19.333 --> 38:20.541
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.291
You doing okay?

38:23.208 --> 38:24.541
Is it the seniority thing?

38:24.625 --> 38:26.500
-No.
-SHIV: Or the...

38:27.625 --> 38:28.708
you know, the...

38:28.791 --> 38:29.958
prison possibility?

38:31.958 --> 38:33.875
(SIGHS) I just...

38:33.958 --> 38:36.750
I just keep thinking about,
you know,

38:36.833 --> 38:38.250
you know, when we get home,

38:38.875 --> 38:40.083
uh, before dinner

38:40.166 --> 38:42.958
we have that very first glass
of cold white wine.

38:43.041 --> 38:44.291
-SHIV: Uh-huh.
-On an empty stomach,

38:44.375 --> 38:46.541
you know that
very cold glass of wine?

38:46.625 --> 38:48.375
I fucking love that!

38:48.458 --> 38:49.750
I just love that and I...

38:50.583 --> 38:51.583
And so I did a bit of research

38:51.666 --> 38:54.041
and I got deep
into the prison blogs again.

38:54.125 --> 38:56.375
-Oh, honey!
-You know, about "toilet wine".

38:56.458 --> 38:58.791
And turns out you can make it
from fruit and ketchup

38:58.875 --> 39:02.208
but you have to "burp"
the wine back as it ferments.

39:02.291 --> 39:05.583
And I thought, "What if I forget
to burp the toilet wine?"

39:05.666 --> 39:07.750
But the truth is
I'm not gonna get wine

39:07.833 --> 39:10.208
of any temperature
in prison, Shiv.

39:10.291 --> 39:12.083
There are no
fine wines in prison.

39:12.166 --> 39:13.791
You don't get to
choose what you eat.

39:13.875 --> 39:16.166
You don't get to
say what you do.

When is "lights out"?

39:21.333 --> 39:23.833
I'm fucking--
I'm fucking terrified, Shiv.

Hey!

39:25.500 --> 39:26.625
Hey, it's--

39:30.291 --> 39:31.500
I mean, uh--

39:32.416 --> 39:33.916
I don't know
what I can say to you.

-I've just spoken to Karl.

with your level of input.

Oh? (CHUCKLES)
Okay. Well, fuck him, right?

40:03.666 --> 40:05.750
I don't need another toothache.

40:05.833 --> 40:09.125
Well, you okayed me to
go in there and kick some ass.

40:09.208 --> 40:12.125
-And I barely--
-I gave you a destination.

40:13.166 --> 40:14.750
I can't walk you there, okay?

40:14.833 --> 40:17.583
Okay, Dad,
but if you give in to Karl,

40:17.666 --> 40:19.625
then everyone starts
to carve me out.

40:19.708 --> 40:20.958
There's a line.

40:21.041 --> 40:23.166
<i>-And--</i>
-Nothing is a line.

40:23.250 --> 40:26.833
Everything everywhere
is always moving forever.

40:27.833 --> 40:28.875
Get used to it.

40:29.250 --> 40:30.250
Okay.

40:41.208 --> 40:42.583
LOGAN: So, Josh...

40:43.708 --> 40:44.791
where are we on this?

40:44.875 --> 40:47.666
You know, I have a wife at home.
(LAUGHS)

40:48.291 --> 40:50.083
Uh, thank you.

40:50.583 --> 40:51.583
Uh...

40:52.041 --> 40:53.208
Well, uh...

40:54.375 --> 40:55.416
help yourself.

40:58.500 --> 41:01.166
Uh, I hear you
on the fundamentals.

41:02.625 --> 41:04.000
You know.

41:04.083 --> 41:06.208
I mean, fuck Sandy and Stewy.

41:06.291 --> 41:08.125
That's just
financial engineering and...

41:08.833 --> 41:10.250
I can do that myself, right?

41:10.333 --> 41:11.708
Yeah, absolutely.

41:11.791 --> 41:12.916
But this...

41:13.000 --> 41:14.333
this still feels off.

41:14.416 --> 41:15.791
I mean, Ken, it feels like...

41:17.083 --> 41:18.708
I mean, you want your dad
to go to jail?

41:20.541 --> 41:23.416
Well, uh,
that's not for me to say.

41:23.500 --> 41:24.791
JOSH: I mean,
it kind of is, though.

41:24.875 --> 41:28.000
Like if you were a judge,
you'd want him to go to prison?

41:28.083 --> 41:30.333
I believe the traditional
whistleblowing process

41:30.416 --> 41:31.666
would be subverted.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.250
-So, that's why I--
-JOSH: Uh, but Logan,

41:33.333 --> 41:34.833
the reputational hit?

41:34.916 --> 41:36.500
I mean, optically,

41:36.583 --> 41:37.791
maybe you become...

41:38.583 --> 41:39.666
a punchline.

41:39.750 --> 41:41.708
One of those big guys
who aren't coming back.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.250
When is this gonna end?

41:44.333 --> 41:46.333
I'm hearing separate planes.

41:46.416 --> 41:47.583
I gotta say...

41:47.666 --> 41:49.916
I don't like betting
on blood feuds.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.875
It ends with me in control...

41:53.708 --> 41:54.791
slapped wrists,

41:55.416 --> 41:56.500
and a payout.

41:57.541 --> 41:58.666
That stuff...

41:59.625 --> 42:00.625
sea mist.

42:01.291 --> 42:02.833
Vapor.

42:02.916 --> 42:04.125
JOSH: Here's the disconnect.

42:04.750 --> 42:06.541
See, I think that...

42:08.291 --> 42:09.416
end of the day...

42:10.791 --> 42:12.666
you work for the shareholders.

42:14.125 --> 42:15.166
For me.

42:16.958 --> 42:20.041
But I think that you think

42:20.125 --> 42:23.666
that I'm some dipshit who had
a lucky night at the casino,

42:23.750 --> 42:25.000
who acts all fancy,

42:25.083 --> 42:28.000
and then makes you eat fucking
rodents for my pleasure.

42:28.083 --> 42:29.125
Right?

42:31.041 --> 42:32.458
But I have a gun at your head.

42:33.750 --> 42:37.791
And I need to know if this is
gonna be a functional situation.

42:38.666 --> 42:40.041
And I'm sure you're gonna say,

42:40.125 --> 42:42.208
"Yes, it is going to be
a functional situation."

42:42.291 --> 42:43.583
But I'm gonna need
to hear you say

42:43.666 --> 42:45.125
that it's
a functional situation.

42:45.875 --> 42:47.833
So, can you work together?

42:49.958 --> 42:51.750
-Uh-huh.
-Sure. Absolutely.

42:52.166 --> 42:54.416
(LAUGHS)

42:55.208 --> 42:57.083
Oh, fuck. This is tough.

42:58.666 --> 43:01.208
This is-- It's fucking tough,
I gotta say. 'Cause...

43:04.166 --> 43:06.833
I don't really believe you.
I mean, I kinda don't.

43:10.458 --> 43:11.500
It'll be okay.

43:14.416 --> 43:15.541
It'll be okay...

43:16.375 --> 43:18.083
because he's a good kid.

43:18.166 --> 43:19.708
-He's a good kid?
-LOGAN: Yeah.

43:20.583 --> 43:21.666
He's a good kid.

43:23.500 --> 43:24.500
(CHUCKLES)

43:25.250 --> 43:26.833
-Okay.
-LOGAN: Yeah.

43:26.916 --> 43:28.791
He did what he thought was best.

43:28.875 --> 43:31.208
I think he went too far, but...

43:32.041 --> 43:33.083
he's a good kid.

43:34.416 --> 43:35.666
Yeah?

43:35.750 --> 43:37.083
He's a good kid...

43:39.041 --> 43:40.125
and I love him.

43:41.708 --> 43:42.791
LOGAN: I mean...

43:43.583 --> 43:44.958
there'll be a big number.

43:45.041 --> 43:48.458
We'll pay, he'll mew and cry
and-- and I'll get it.

43:48.541 --> 43:50.500
It'll all be okay.

43:51.166 --> 43:52.166
And...

43:53.375 --> 43:54.375
maybe...

43:55.375 --> 43:56.583
it'll be him one day.

43:57.750 --> 43:58.916
It's in his blood.

43:59.833 --> 44:01.250
He learned it all from me.

44:03.166 --> 44:04.208
And maybe...

44:05.791 --> 44:07.833
maybe he's the best one
of all of them.

44:08.958 --> 44:09.958
So, yeah...

44:10.916 --> 44:11.958
it'll be okay.

44:13.250 --> 44:14.250
Wow!

44:16.833 --> 44:17.833
Well...

44:19.666 --> 44:21.125
So, that's nice to hear?

44:21.625 --> 44:22.625
Right?

44:24.000 --> 44:25.291
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

44:28.166 --> 44:29.166
JOSH: Huh.

44:30.125 --> 44:32.083
So, I guess...

44:32.166 --> 44:35.041
for me to come your way,
I have a little wish list.

44:35.125 --> 44:36.583
A little EPS-juicing.

44:37.166 --> 44:38.541
Some stock buyback.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.125
You know...

44:40.208 --> 44:41.541
let me in. Hmm?

44:43.833 --> 44:44.875
Sounds good.

44:44.958 --> 44:47.416
I'd consider that. Absolutely.

44:47.500 --> 44:49.250
(PHONE RINGS)

44:49.333 --> 44:51.750
I'd appreciate that, Logan.

44:53.833 --> 44:55.083
Uh, I should take this.

44:55.166 --> 44:57.250
I want to make sure
we get back a little easier.

44:57.333 --> 44:58.875
(LAUGHS) City boy, huh?

44:58.958 --> 45:04.000
Well, you're a bit far from
your nearest coffee and bagel.

45:04.083 --> 45:05.208

45:05.291 --> 45:06.291
Yeah.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Okay?

Look, shall we head back?
They'll, uh...

46:13.416 --> 46:14.916
They'll send some carts for us.

or we can walk up to the...

You wanna rest up, old geezer?

I'm good.

46:49.666 --> 46:51.541

46:51.625 --> 46:54.625
Well, you'll say anything to get
fucked on a date, won't you?

46:57.875 --> 46:59.333
You know, Greg's with me now.

47:00.125 --> 47:02.083
He tell you? Huh?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.750

47:21.458 --> 47:24.750
Dad, you're the silverback,

47:24.833 --> 47:26.583

Do you understand?

47:28.125 --> 47:29.291
You know something, son?

I'd sooner get fucked by a spic

it's going to the ocean.

No, no, this is the short way.

48:34.833 --> 48:36.833

Hey, it's pretty rough, though.

48:43.666 --> 48:45.166
So, you wanna wait for the cart?

48:45.250 --> 48:46.333
I mean, there's a lot of bumps.

49:34.125 --> 49:36.083

and she's a fucking dipshit.

I hear no one respects her.
Everyone's digging her out.

49:42.458 --> 49:44.916

Oh.

53:24.625 --> 53:25.666
SHIV: Thanks, Wanda.

53:29.625 --> 53:30.708
-Hey!
-MARK: Hi.

53:30.791 --> 53:33.458
-It is editorial, so...
-Yeah.

53:33.541 --> 53:34.958
I have a line for you
on the President

53:35.041 --> 53:37.833
that we'd like you to
start rolling out immediately.

53:37.916 --> 53:39.666
We're open to suggestions,
but, uh,

53:39.750 --> 53:43.000
we just feel like
our general ideological sympathy

53:43.083 --> 53:46.250
has maybe let them off the hook
on too many specifics.

53:46.333 --> 53:48.291
Right? Like big tech.

53:48.375 --> 53:49.625
Middle East.

53:49.708 --> 53:50.833
Green subsidies.

53:50.916 --> 53:54.250
We'd like a branded
nightly segment, like...

53:55.166 --> 53:59.416
"Is he losing his grip?"

54:01.333 --> 54:03.083
You know he's a friend, right?

54:03.166 --> 54:06.041
But with a question mark, like,
"Is he?"

54:06.125 --> 54:08.166
Oh! Oh, with a question mark!

54:08.250 --> 54:11.083
Well, thank you for giving me
discretion on the punctuation.

54:11.166 --> 54:12.958
Shiv, I have a perspective.

54:13.291 --> 54:14.458
Okay?

54:14.541 --> 54:17.250
And a reputation that I've
built up over a number of years.

54:17.333 --> 54:19.250
But this is something
my dad wants.

54:20.041 --> 54:23.250
So, one, he has a great antenna

54:23.333 --> 54:24.833
and you should
trust his hunches.

54:24.916 --> 54:26.000
But two...

54:27.166 --> 54:29.083
in a sense, this conversation
is already over.

54:29.166 --> 54:30.375
It's just a question of
how many times

54:30.458 --> 54:31.833
we scream the word
"Fuck" at each other

54:31.916 --> 54:33.291
before you do what we want.

54:35.750 --> 54:38.791
What if I go public with this
full-court press?

54:38.875 --> 54:40.625
Incredibly embarrassing for you.

54:40.708 --> 54:42.541
Yeah, but...

54:42.625 --> 54:45.958
the thing about us, Mark,
and you should know this by now,

54:46.791 --> 54:48.250
we don't get embarrassed.

54:49.791 --> 54:51.333
After me. Thanks.

54:55.333 --> 54:57.666
Hey! How're things looking?

54:57.750 --> 55:00.208
Conference call with lawyers
before they head back in.

55:00.291 --> 55:03.500
Sandy and Stewy. No progress.
It's not good.

55:03.583 --> 55:04.666
And how was the date?

55:04.750 --> 55:06.833
Did you fuck him
or tug him off between courses?

55:08.166 --> 55:09.208
Enough, okay?

55:09.291 --> 55:10.458
-GERRI: Seriously, I mean it.
-Enough. Stop it.

55:10.541 --> 55:12.000
Seriously,
stop flirting with me.

55:12.083 --> 55:13.625
What do you want?

55:14.791 --> 55:16.041
You're gonna fucking die.

55:18.250 --> 55:19.916
-GERRI: Oh, God!
-ROMAN: I know.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.666
Don't use this.

55:22.750 --> 55:26.291
No! Come on--
That is a magic bullet.

55:26.375 --> 55:27.291
He's gonna love it.

55:27.375 --> 55:28.666
Dad's gonna give me
my bedtime bath.

55:28.750 --> 55:32.166
Bank the photos. By all means.
But don't spread it around.

55:32.250 --> 55:33.750
Yeah, it's great for Logan.

55:33.833 --> 55:35.166
It's bad for Kendall.

55:35.250 --> 55:36.625
It's bad for you.

55:36.708 --> 55:38.083
"The Tattoo Brothers"?

55:39.458 --> 55:41.750
Oh, okay, so, what?
You, uh-- you care?

55:41.833 --> 55:44.333
"How does this advance
my personal position?"

55:44.416 --> 55:47.375
You need to
think about that 24/7.

55:47.458 --> 55:49.416
You should get that
tattooed on your head.

55:49.958 --> 55:51.416
Here.

55:51.500 --> 55:53.375
Keep the photos.
Our little secret.

55:56.166 --> 55:57.833
Oh, did you hear about your dad?

55:57.916 --> 55:58.916
No, what?

56:00.166 --> 56:02.208
LOGAN: Uh-huh. I'm sorry.

56:03.125 --> 56:04.791
I don't control them like that.

56:06.125 --> 56:09.000
-He has editorial freedom.

56:09.083 --> 56:11.750

That's just rumors.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.041
Watch the show!

56:15.125 --> 56:16.541
I'm sure it won't seem so bad.

56:17.833 --> 56:20.416
(INDISTINCT CHATTER

56:21.416 --> 56:23.125
You want to hear
what it sounds like

56:23.208 --> 56:25.083
when the President
loses his temper?

(GIGGLES)

56:31.208 --> 56:32.416
(CHUCKLES)

56:33.250 --> 56:36.000
Look, let me investigate.
I--

56:36.083 --> 56:37.166
You know Mark.

56:37.250 --> 56:40.708
He's very tenacious,
very independent.

56:40.791 --> 56:42.750
I don't know,
but if I wasn't so tied up

56:42.833 --> 56:44.541
in this fucking investigation,

56:44.625 --> 56:49.041
I could focus on keeping
ATN on message. Hmm?

56:51.833 --> 56:54.375
ROMAN: Hey, I hear
you tried to kill Dad again?

56:54.458 --> 56:55.875
It was just heat exhaustion.

56:55.958 --> 56:57.333
Uh, that's not
what we're hearing.

56:57.416 --> 56:59.708
We're hearing that you took an
old man out to die in the sun.

56:59.791 --> 57:01.541
We went for a hike with Josh.

57:01.625 --> 57:04.416
You tried to assassinate
our dad with the sun.

57:04.500 --> 57:06.500
Do you have a fetish
for nearly killing Dad?

57:06.583 --> 57:08.875
Like, "Just the tip"
but for like killing Dad?

57:08.958 --> 57:10.750
Well, look, it's in hand.

57:10.833 --> 57:11.833
The vote.

57:11.916 --> 57:12.916
Josh is a lock.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.625
Uh, well, no, actually.
He's out.

57:14.708 --> 57:15.708
What are you talking about?

57:15.791 --> 57:18.166
-He's with us.
-ROMAN:<i> No! He's out.</i>

57:18.250 --> 57:19.416
Frank just got off the phone.

57:19.500 --> 57:21.541
Apparently, Dad's little
freak-out gave him the shits.

57:21.625 --> 57:23.541
<i>Weak leadership,</i>
<i>fractured at the top.</i>

57:23.625 --> 57:26.083
You let him fucking shrivel,
he saw that.

57:26.166 --> 57:27.125
And now he has, quote,

57:27.208 --> 57:29.291
"Zero faith in the
post-Dad leadership."

57:29.375 --> 57:30.458
It's not my fault
he's an old man

57:30.541 --> 57:31.708
who can't climb a fucking hill.

57:31.791 --> 57:33.291
We're about to lose the company
at the shareholder meet,

57:33.375 --> 57:37.125
all because you wouldn't give
our dad a timely fucking Evian.
