**

00:12.713 --> 00:21.021
**

00:23.791 --> 00:30.564
**

00:30.598 --> 00:31.732
Hmm.

00:31.765 --> 00:32.933
Mmm.

00:32.966 --> 00:34.268
Mr. Corneille:
Take my hand, Nigel!

00:34.302 --> 00:36.570
I have come to show you
the journey within.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.939
Uh, Mr. Small,
is there anything weird

00:38.972 --> 00:41.242
in this candy you brought
back from your vacation?

00:41.275 --> 00:43.277
Fear me not, Nigel!

00:43.311 --> 00:47.248
For I am your
spirit anima-a-a-al!

00:47.281 --> 00:49.417
Um, Mr. Small?

00:49.450 --> 00:52.453
My hands! They're like
spiders made out of meat!

00:52.486 --> 00:53.754
Aah!

00:55.923 --> 00:58.259
Mr. Small? Mr. Small!

00:58.292 --> 01:00.194
What is in this candy?!

01:03.731 --> 01:06.800
Ah. It's not candy.
It's a candle.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.571
Sorry, kids, but there's
no school today.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.806
The staff have all been
evacuated to the hospital.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.974
Aah!

01:14.007 --> 01:15.609
Dude, you can
at least show concern.

01:15.643 --> 01:18.146
Yeah, you're right.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.716
Come on.
Let's go home.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.652
Mr. Dad will be
surprised to see us.

01:24.685 --> 01:25.719
Yeah.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.821
We might interrupt
his third breakfast.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.827
Hey!

01:33.861 --> 01:35.463
Uh, hi, guys. What's up?

01:35.496 --> 01:37.298
School was canceled.
What's that on your lips?

01:37.331 --> 01:40.301
Oh, I, uh...I was
just eating some, uh...

01:40.334 --> 01:41.669
What's that awful stuff
that's like fruit

01:41.702 --> 01:43.237
that people decorate
plates with?

01:43.271 --> 01:45.273
You mean a vegetable?

01:45.306 --> 01:47.808
Uh, yes. That's what
stained my lips --

01:47.841 --> 01:49.177
a vergertule.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.678
What kind?

01:50.711 --> 01:51.845
A re

01:51.879 --> 01:53.814
Okay, stop lying.
We saw her. Who is she?

01:53.847 --> 01:55.849
Uh...what's the name
of those people that you pay

01:55.883 --> 01:57.918
to make your skin cry
until you're thin?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.287
A personal trainer?

01:59.320 --> 02:00.688
That's it!
She was reminding me I have to

02:00.721 --> 02:03.090
go to that place where
the bicycles go nowhere.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.458
You mean the gym?

02:04.492 --> 02:06.694
Yes, the gym.
And I'm late! 'Kay, bye.

02:06.727 --> 02:09.363
I don't think
he's going to the gym.

02:09.397 --> 02:11.465
'Cause the only gym
he goes to is Jim the cashier

02:11.499 --> 02:13.801
at the doughnut store?
No. I mean, yes.

02:13.834 --> 02:18.572
But also because that gym bag
he grabbed was a woman's purse.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.943
Oh, I'm going to the gym.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.212
Liar!

02:24.245 --> 02:25.813
He's buying perfume
for that woman.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.014
Maybe it's just for him.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.183
Yeah, sure, to hide the scent
of his  shame!

02:29.217 --> 02:30.384
Uh...

02:30.418 --> 02:32.052
-Aah!
That was close.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.854
He nearly saw u--

02:34.822 --> 02:36.390
Huh?

02:36.424 --> 02:37.891
I guess
4K's how far you have to stand

02:37.925 --> 02:39.560
away from the camera
so you don't look like

02:39.593 --> 02:41.562
a photo from
a dermatology textbook.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.897
Where did he go?

02:43.931 --> 02:47.067
**

02:53.106 --> 03:05.386
**

03:05.419 --> 03:08.256
Look, it's the lady
we saw at home.

03:08.289 --> 03:11.259
Well, hello, girls.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.093
Let's eavesdrop.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.595
Ah, Samantha. Finally.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.096
We've been waiting so long,

03:16.129 --> 03:18.098
Angela's clothes
are back in fashion.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.534
Better late
than ugly, Maria.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.903
A girl needs to make
some effort for her man.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.172
Samantha, darling,
the last time you were a girl

03:25.205 --> 03:26.340
men still had gills.

03:27.941 --> 03:31.245
So, when do we get to meet
elusive boyfriend of yours?

03:31.279 --> 03:33.447
Oh, he's not
elusive, Angela.

03:33.481 --> 03:34.782
He just doesn't like
to answer questions

03:34.815 --> 03:36.284
straightforwardly
and and prefers changing

03:36.317 --> 03:37.785
the subject to avoid them.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.187
Samantha, are you nervous
because we might

03:40.220 --> 03:41.455
judge your new boyfriend?

03:41.489 --> 03:43.357
No, Violet,
she's worried about how

03:43.391 --> 03:45.859
mimes place their orders
at the drive-through.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.729
Ah, you younger women
are so demanding.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.131
So what if Samantha's boyfriend
isn't around that much?

03:51.164 --> 03:54.268
As long as a man has a pulse
and a smile, who cares?

03:54.302 --> 03:55.903
I'd be so happy to
get a man with either

03:55.936 --> 03:58.806
of those things, and at my age,
I don't care which.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.309
Do you think he might
have a friend for me?

04:01.342 --> 04:03.076
Yes, Violet.
The Easter Bunny.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.945
Samantha: Now, you listen here.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.647
My man does exist!

04:06.680 --> 04:08.816
As a matter of fact, I'm meeting
him in the park later.

04:08.849 --> 04:12.986
What the wha-a-a-a!!

04:15.456 --> 04:17.124
Ugh, this is taking forever.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.459
I've not got a lot of time.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.761
Skin and regrets,
yes, but time, no.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.163
Do you think maybe
he's running a little late?

04:23.196 --> 04:24.665
No, Violet.
He arrived on time.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.900
He just set our watches
early for a prank.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.937
Both: Hmm...

04:31.372 --> 04:33.173
Oh! There he is.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.908
Hello, sugar.

04:35.943 --> 04:36.977
-Hey, honey.
-Mm!

04:37.010 --> 04:38.178
How's your day been?

04:42.550 --> 04:44.785
Oh, it makes my heart
skip a beat to know

04:44.818 --> 04:47.488
that love can still
blossom at our age.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.289
Wait. That's two beats.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.191
Three! Somebody do something!

04:51.224 --> 04:52.860
Ooh!
Oh, yeah, there it is.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.995
Mm!

04:55.028 --> 04:56.630
I can't believe it.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.198
Dad always said Mom
was out of his league,

04:58.231 --> 05:00.368
but I never thought
he'd want to get back down

05:00.401 --> 05:01.602
into his own league.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.036
What's that?

05:03.070 --> 05:05.473
The bombshell that just
got dropped on us.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.875
Huh. I always thought
that was a metaphor.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.211
**

05:12.713 --> 05:14.348
We know about Samantha.

05:14.382 --> 05:15.816
Oh.

05:15.849 --> 05:19.052
Well, I guess you were bound
to find out one day.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.488
How do you feel about it?

05:21.489 --> 05:22.823
Oh, just great!

05:22.856 --> 05:24.358
How do you think Mom
would feel about it?!

05:24.392 --> 05:26.059
Well, she's not around
in the day.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.896
I've got to find some way
of keeping myself entertained.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.230
Entertained?!

05:31.432 --> 05:33.033
Is it so bad
that I have some fun?

05:33.066 --> 05:35.369
I enjoy the time
I spend with my girls.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.870
Girls!

05:38.105 --> 05:40.574
What difference does it make
if it's more than one?

05:40.608 --> 05:42.410
You maggot. How many?

05:42.443 --> 05:45.579
Three at the moment, but,
you know, the more the merrier.

05:45.613 --> 05:46.814
I think I'm gonna be sick.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.982
Our dad has
a secret double life.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.919
Darwin, smash another plate.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.587
Hold on.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.929
**

06:04.297 --> 06:08.569
**

06:08.602 --> 06:10.938
Dagnabit, I bought
the paper ones.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.674
I don't see what's so wrong with
having a secret double life.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.108
-Look how it's already

06:15.142 --> 06:16.444
affecting us!

06:16.477 --> 06:19.246
Yeah, well, only because
it's not secret anymore.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.748
So I was
technically correct.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.783
Nothing wrong with having
a "secret" double life.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.051
Dad,
this whole thing

06:24.084 --> 06:27.588
is based on lies,
and that's not right!

06:27.621 --> 06:29.790
I understand.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.092
I've deceived
the people I love.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.762
I'm gonna go end it
with the other girls.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.730
Then I'll take
all of Samantha's stuff

06:36.764 --> 06:40.868
down to the junkyard
and burn it in a big bonfire.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.936
Or maybe just tell her
by text or something...?

06:42.970 --> 06:45.973
No. I need to make sure
I can never go back.

06:46.006 --> 06:49.142
Yep. Burning all her stuff in
the dump -- that'll do it.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.652
I'm sure gonna
miss this pretty face.

06:58.686 --> 07:02.890
But at least
I'm bowing out with grace.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.492
Aah! Darn heels.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.760
Do you realize
what this means?

07:06.794 --> 07:08.496
Of course!

07:08.529 --> 07:10.831
Samantha was in the bathroom
the whole time!

07:10.864 --> 07:12.332
Of course!

07:12.365 --> 07:14.334
Mrs. Mom is Samantha!

07:15.435 --> 07:18.438
Mr. Dad is...Mrs. Mom?

07:18.472 --> 07:19.640
I'm Mr. Dad?

07:19.673 --> 07:21.008
Dad and Samantha
are the same person!

07:21.041 --> 07:22.643
So we better stop him
before he ruins

07:22.676 --> 07:25.445
his beautiful friendship
with those sassy girls.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.783
Mmm, Maria,
this cheesecake is so good

07:29.817 --> 07:31.852
I want to marry it
and have its cupcakes.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.587
Oh, that reminds me

07:33.621 --> 07:34.855
of a story
from Minnesota.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.957
Does it involve
a woman marrying a cake?

07:36.990 --> 07:39.292
Oh no. I'm afraid it was
at a time when society

07:39.326 --> 07:41.028
wasn't as tolerant
as it is now.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.530
People were only
allowed to marry a potato

07:42.563 --> 07:43.697
from a different farm.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.032
Can we just skip

07:45.065 --> 07:47.300
the nonsense part
and get to the end please?

07:47.334 --> 07:49.202
Oh. Sure.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.704
The end.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.106
I have a dramatic
announcement to make.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.175
He dumped you
for a slimmer woman.
No.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.344
He dumped you
for a younger woman?
No.

07:57.377 --> 08:00.047
He dumped you for a potato
from a different farm?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.214
What? No.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.383
It's about my
new boyfriend.

08:03.416 --> 08:06.820
He doesn't really exist.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.022
And the rest
of the forfeit.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.727
And there is more.
I've been deceiving y'all.

08:13.761 --> 08:16.564
But I have decided
to break the circle of lies.

08:16.597 --> 08:20.233
My real name
isn't "Samantha."

08:20.267 --> 08:22.636
Wait, so your name's not
Samantha

08:22.670 --> 08:24.371
No. There's more.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.239
You're bald?

08:26.273 --> 08:27.908
I'll give you
one more clue.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.410
You're ugly?

08:30.443 --> 08:32.512
Okay, one more clue.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.148
You're a naturist?!

08:35.182 --> 08:36.817
He's a man, Violet!

08:36.850 --> 08:40.220
Well, I guess the clue was
in the name -- Sa-man-tha.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.489
Also, guess what you get
if you switch the letters

08:42.522 --> 08:43.557
of her name around?

08:43.591 --> 08:45.258
"'Thas A Man"!

08:45.292 --> 08:46.727
I'm sorry.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.495
But why would
you lie to us?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.764
I was a bored
house husband.

08:50.798 --> 08:53.166
I did try and make
some male friends...

08:53.200 --> 08:56.003
Hey, bro! Did you see
that boxing game last night

08:56.036 --> 08:57.838
with the guy who did
a touchdown in the hoop

08:57.871 --> 08:59.539
with his basketball stick?

09:02.475 --> 09:03.877
Sorry. Excuse me.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.013
Coming through.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.082
Hey, bud, can you pass me
that nut spinner flex?

09:11.151 --> 09:12.953
Here you go.
Wait, what is that?

09:13.821 --> 09:14.922
-Whoo!

09:14.955 --> 09:18.258
-Yeah, nice one!

09:18.291 --> 09:19.793
Not.

09:19.827 --> 09:24.231
But I guess I'm just not
that great at being a man.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.034
Then I saw you guys.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.937
You were so free and loving.

09:29.970 --> 09:33.540
You were just being yourselves.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.108
I did what I had to do!

09:35.142 --> 09:37.577
It's not my fault
if society doesn't approve

09:37.611 --> 09:39.379
of men being friends
with mature women.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.248
Literally no one has
a problem with that.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.449
Ah.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.952
Well, in that case, I did
what I didn't have to do.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.220
Well, Richard, there's something
you should know, too --

09:47.254 --> 09:48.288
Samantha, wait!

09:48.321 --> 09:49.589
It's okay, boys.

09:49.623 --> 09:50.991
The cat's out of the bag.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.661
Yeah, or more like
the large pink, naked rabbit

09:53.694 --> 09:55.328
is out of his pants.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.563
But before I go,

09:56.596 --> 09:59.332
I would just like to say
one last thing --

09:59.366 --> 10:01.802
Thank you for being a friend.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.972
No please, wait!

10:05.005 --> 10:08.508
You're not the only one
who lied.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.177
We all felt
the same way.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.511
Yes. Me too.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.681
I guess not.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.684
Well, this is awkward.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.852
So, I guess we'll
just have to go back to

10:18.886 --> 10:20.854
being sad,
lonely old men.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.923
But why don't you just
carry on hanging out as guys?

10:22.956 --> 10:25.525
Unless we keep
dressing up and just pretend

10:25.558 --> 10:26.626
none of this
ever happened!

10:26.660 --> 10:27.695
Together: Mm-hmm!

10:27.728 --> 10:29.196
Or you could
just be friends.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.364
Well, if it's a choice
between continuing

10:31.398 --> 10:32.599
to dress up as old ladies...

10:32.632 --> 10:33.801
-It isn't.
-...or we stop

10:33.834 --> 10:35.202
spending time together --
-It isn't.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.204
That's settled then.
We have no option

10:37.237 --> 10:39.506
but to ignore the fact
we're all actually men.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.375
-No, you don't.
-We all have to make sacrifices.

10:42.409 --> 10:43.510
No, you don--

10:45.012 --> 10:48.348
* You've been a pal
to me for so long now *

10:48.381 --> 10:52.219
* Season after season,
you kept going somehow *

10:52.252 --> 10:54.722
* And I know

10:54.755 --> 10:56.656
* You'll always be on cable

10:58.759 --> 11:00.227
Eh. Whatever
floats your boat.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.063
* And when you're needing
a helping hand *

11:04.531 --> 11:15.909
**

11:15.943 --> 11:27.187
**

11:27.220 --> 11:38.698
**
