00:01.042 --> 00:03.586
NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.670 --> 00:04.671
I want you to pull him up.

00:04.754 --> 00:08.091
Did you ever do an autopsy
on a three-week-old stiff?

00:08.174 --> 00:10.093
-Took him right out of the limousine.
-Took who?

00:10.427 --> 00:12.971
-They took the governor?
-Not the governor, Ray. Lamont.

00:13.054 --> 00:15.056
Hey, Furillo, I get the impression

00:15.140 --> 00:17.851
you're implying gang involvement
in this affair.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.519
I'm not afraid, Mick.

00:19.811 --> 00:20.812
What are you talkin' about?

00:20.895 --> 00:22.856
Mick, I wanna be your snitch.

00:23.648 --> 00:27.652
To the prettiest lady that ever graced
this sorry side of the tracks.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.779
Here's to slumming with the city's finest.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.656
(laughs) You're a real pistol, lady.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.158
What's so funny?

00:33.241 --> 00:34.909
I might have implied that he had...

00:34.993 --> 00:37.954
an unnaturally close relationship
with his mother.

00:40.498 --> 00:44.961
ESTERHAUS: Item 12,
as regards the sweet bird of youth,

00:45.045 --> 00:47.297
which graces our communion this a.m.
in the persons

00:47.380 --> 00:51.217
of six of the Metropolitan
Police Academy's finest Fall graduates.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.095
-MAN: Whoopee.
-If memory serves, Pete Dorsey.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.638
Pete, will you wave or something?

00:56.389 --> 00:58.558
-MAN: Hey, Pete can wave.
-MAN 2: Hey, hey.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.727
Robin Tataglia.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.438
(murmuring)

01:03.521 --> 01:04.689
Martin Froman.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.316
John Cooper.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.445
Tom Hernandez.
Tom, you go by "Tom" or "Tomás"?

01:10.528 --> 01:11.654
Tom's fine.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.075
Uh, Nathaniel Crawford.
"Nate"? "Nat"? What?

01:15.533 --> 01:17.660
-Nate, I guess.
-You got it.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.788
People, let's have
a warm round of greetings

01:19.871 --> 01:21.748
for these cherubic
new denizens of our swamp.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.042
(chattering)

01:24.125 --> 01:26.419
All rookies will temporarily
be assigned Dekker foot patrol

01:26.503 --> 01:27.545
until Division figures out

01:27.629 --> 01:29.339
how to integrate this year's bumper crop

01:29.422 --> 01:30.840
into regular RMP units.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.634
I'm already integrated.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.511
That's right. I'm your daddy.

01:35.845 --> 01:38.807
ESTERHAUS: There'll be telephonic
check-in each 45 minutes,

01:39.057 --> 01:41.309
but I trust that more
experienced street personnel

01:41.392 --> 01:45.396
will be liberally forthcoming
with aid and succor.

01:45.480 --> 01:50.652
(chattering, laughing)

01:50.735 --> 01:52.028
Item 13,

01:52.529 --> 01:55.490
Governor and Mrs. Lucas Sandler

01:56.157 --> 01:59.410
will be dedicating the new Von Steuben
unemployment office

01:59.494 --> 02:00.787
at 10:00 a.m. this morning.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.248
Prior to said christening,
the governor's party plans

02:03.331 --> 02:06.709
-a whistle-stop at this precinct house.
-(groaning)

02:06.960 --> 02:12.507
I urge you all to refrain
from the sort of unfortunate behavior

02:13.007 --> 02:15.593
which marred His Honor's
on his last visit here in '73,

02:15.677 --> 02:19.013
when one veteran officer felt impelled...

02:19.514 --> 02:22.142
by reasons unknown,
to present the governor

02:22.225 --> 02:23.935
with the miracle of the moon at midday.

02:24.018 --> 02:27.188
(laughing, chattering)

02:29.440 --> 02:31.151
I might append a similar
cautionary note...

02:31.234 --> 02:33.653
vis-à-vis the going-away party
this evening

02:33.736 --> 02:35.697
of Patrolman Anthony Tisa.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.449
Captain Furillo
and I are urgently concerned

02:38.533 --> 02:42.245
that, uh, behavior remain decorous
as this coed affair.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.999
Moreover,
word from the Club Como management

02:46.082 --> 02:49.377
is that panty hose in the plumbing system

02:49.919 --> 02:52.046
-will no longer be tolerated.
-(chattering)

02:52.130 --> 02:54.465
-Who are you lookin' at?
-Item last.

02:54.549 --> 02:57.010
Two more sightings yesterday
of the Phantom.

02:57.886 --> 03:02.390
Snatching a half dozen cantaloupes
from a Korean green grocer on Hudson,

03:03.016 --> 03:06.394
harassing a meter maid
working the projects north of 133rd.

03:06.477 --> 03:08.271
For our newcomers, the Phantom of the Hill

03:08.354 --> 03:12.442
appears to be a guy
living in the sewer system, 6'5" or 6",

03:12.525 --> 03:15.486
heavily bearded and scarred,
perhaps drastically deformed,

03:15.862 --> 03:17.280
dressed in rags or worse,

03:17.363 --> 03:20.158
incapable of speech
in the Mother Tongue or otherwise.

03:20.450 --> 03:25.914
He bears a manifest
and virulent hatred for police.

03:26.748 --> 03:30.335
And the standing reward for his collar
is three months without weekends.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.128
(murmuring)

03:32.503 --> 03:36.424
All right, that's it. Let's roll,
and let's be very careful out there.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.720
(chattering)

03:44.140 --> 03:45.016
Oh, no.

03:45.099 --> 03:49.145
(indistinct chatter)

03:49.229 --> 03:51.105
-Hey, Renko. Renko.
-What?

03:51.189 --> 03:53.441
-You ever actually seen this guy?
-Who?

03:53.524 --> 03:55.318
You know, this weirdo
down in the sewer system.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.528
You mean the Phantom.
Well, I can't exactly say, Dorsey,

03:57.612 --> 04:00.907
although we did spot this huge,
slimy dude

04:00.990 --> 04:02.158
rummaging the dumpsters

04:02.242 --> 04:04.202
-over near Elmwood last--
-Yeah, he ducked into a manhole

04:04.285 --> 04:05.954
-before we could see him.
-That could be him.

04:06.037 --> 04:06.955
Belker.

04:08.623 --> 04:09.916
"Mean Sheets."

04:10.333 --> 04:12.168
Is that the one
with all the hairbrush spanking?

04:12.252 --> 04:15.171
-(growls)
-(Hill giggling)

04:15.255 --> 04:17.090
Move. Move!

04:17.173 --> 04:20.051
Bobby. I don't know what to wear tonight.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.929
-Miniskirt. Miniskirt's compulsory.
-Uh--

04:23.638 --> 04:25.723
-Name.
-Curtis.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.434
Curtis what?

04:28.518 --> 04:30.520
Curtis Interuptus.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.107
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:34.440 --> 04:36.150
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:36.234 --> 04:40.029
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:40.113 --> 04:41.739
(sirens wailing)

04:47.203 --> 04:51.124
(theme music playing)

05:49.057 --> 05:51.059
(siren blaring)

06:05.907 --> 06:08.242
Do you believe it?
Guy eats bran muffins for breakfast.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.369
I'm coming out of the john.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.497
He's ordering six bran muffins
and a double stewed prunes.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.832
Hey, even arm busters
got occasional problems

06:14.916 --> 06:16.667
with regularity, my man, you know?

06:16.751 --> 06:18.461
-Excuse me, Detective. Could I ask--
-Get out of here, man

06:18.544 --> 06:21.089
-Just keep walkin' and get out of here.
-Right.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.800
Believe it? First hour on the beat,

06:23.883 --> 06:26.135
kid's doing his best
to blow a murder one collar.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.679
Mm. Hey, here comes Edwards.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.057
Bubba, your behind is mine.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.436
(horn honks)

06:42.902 --> 06:44.695
(horn honking)

07:03.756 --> 07:05.591
(shouting)

07:10.805 --> 07:12.723
Freeze! You're under arrest.

07:12.807 --> 07:13.850
Hit the wall, chump!

07:14.851 --> 07:15.893
-Read him his rights, baby.
-Shit!

07:16.853 --> 07:19.605
(panting) You have the right
to remain silent.

07:19.689 --> 07:23.109
-Come on, man.
-You have the right to an attorney.

07:23.192 --> 07:24.444
And I'll tell you what, Jack--

07:24.694 --> 07:27.738
-We'll read you the rest in the car.
-Hey, nice work, you guys.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.907
Thanks a lot. Welcome to the Hill.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.200
Come on, let's move it out of here.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.745
Hey, are you okay? You cut your lip.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.709
How'd you like to suck the toxins out?

07:42.003 --> 07:43.254
What are you doing with my car?
Get out of here.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.423
-What'd you call me, man?
-I'll call you anything I want.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.967
(both shouting)

07:48.050 --> 07:49.260
-Come on, you guys, break it up.
-MAN: Break it up!

07:49.343 --> 07:52.889
(shouting)

07:52.972 --> 07:57.351
-(clamoring)
-(siren blaring)

07:57.435 --> 07:58.728
Hey, you got a problem, lady?

07:58.811 --> 08:03.566
(shouting)

08:03.649 --> 08:05.026
And you got a big mouth, Jack.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.079
-You feel that?
-Yeah, yeah, I feel it.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.294
RENKO: All right, gimme the keys
right now. License, registration.

08:23.377 --> 08:24.921
-Get out the car. Gimme a license.
-(indistinct)

08:25.004 --> 08:28.382
-You assume the position.
-Quiet down. Quiet down.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.717
Hey, you too, lady. Just quiet down.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.761
Hey, pal, you wanna go in, huh?

08:32.678 --> 08:34.263
-Just knock it off.
-All right, that's pretty good.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.266
Now, first thing, when you get kids
like this you gotta look for a piece.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.310
Second of all, when you separate 'em,
you gotta really mean it.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.354
Third of all, don't be afraid
to call for backups,

08:41.812 --> 08:43.856
even if it's just a fender bender,
like this.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.567
Okay, I'm gonna talk
to these kids now. You watch me.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.865
Uh, I think you got
your carbon reversed there, buddy.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.758
(indistinct chattering)

09:12.260 --> 09:14.011
Governor, our captain

09:14.095 --> 09:17.098
of the most crime-ridden
precinct in the state, Frank Furillo.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.308
-Frank, the governor.
-Frank.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.434
-How do you do?
-Mrs. Sandler.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.896
-My pleasure.
-And... Lamont.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.565
SANDLER: Your fight is my fight, Captain.

09:25.648 --> 09:29.443
We stand shoulder-to-shoulder
on the battleground of urban blight.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.237
And a battleground it is, Governor.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.990
Lieutenant Hunter, EAT.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.492
Why, just last week my men and I

09:36.576 --> 09:39.829
traded cartridges
with a cadre of Hispanic 2-11 artists

09:39.912 --> 09:41.872
in a two-hour project standoff

09:42.248 --> 09:45.209
that was right out of Teddy's
little number on San Juan Hill.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.586
-We--
-We're three minutes behind, sir.

09:46.669 --> 09:50.464
Well, excuse me, Captain.
Appreciate the input, Officer.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.383
-Lieutenant.
-DANIELS: This way, Governor.

09:52.466 --> 09:53.384
Mrs. Sandler.

09:55.636 --> 09:58.639
(clamoring)

09:59.265 --> 10:01.183
Don't you just love pinstripes?

10:02.643 --> 10:05.896
You have bad manners, man! Behave!

10:06.522 --> 10:08.524
ESTERHAUS: John, John, John.
Not now, not now.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.109
The governor of the state, John.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.778
-Oh, sorry, Sarge.
-I'll go pull the paperwork, babe.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.696
Yeah.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.198
In there. In there.

10:17.825 --> 10:18.868
WOMAN: Let's go, let's go.

10:18.951 --> 10:19.785
Portland.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.205
I did write it down, Ma.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.876
On a piece of paper.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.465
I remember where it is, Ma.
I was just there yesterday.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.262
I'll be there as soon as I can after work.

10:38.846 --> 10:42.224
As soon as I can. As soon as I can!

10:43.643 --> 10:44.560
Goodbye.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.942
What are you doin' here?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.862
-How's your dad?
-He's lousy.

10:56.822 --> 10:57.782
He's in a home.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.450
-Oh.
-Eh!

11:00.076 --> 11:02.453
What's up? How's the new job?

11:02.536 --> 11:06.165
Michael, I have never seen
such a cesspool of criminal activity.

11:06.248 --> 11:08.000
I warned you. Didn't I warn you?

11:08.626 --> 11:10.294
You stay out of trouble up there.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.339
Well, that's what I wanted
to discuss with you.

11:14.048 --> 11:14.882
What?

11:15.549 --> 11:18.469
I overhear things,
and I could certainly use the extra money.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.554
What are you talkin' about?

11:20.638 --> 11:22.598
Mick, I wanna be your snitch.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.267
(chuckles)

11:26.102 --> 11:28.270
Come on, get out of here.
I got paperwork to do.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.482
I'm serious. I want us to work together.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.069
And I find law enforcement
terribly exciting.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.072
"Terribly exciting," huh?

11:39.031 --> 11:40.366
You see that gorilla in there?

11:40.866 --> 11:42.159
-(indistinct)
-He just got arrested

11:42.243 --> 11:45.538
for breaking both a guy's legs
and then garroting him to death.

11:45.996 --> 11:46.831
My...

11:47.540 --> 11:50.126
He does have a certain...
ruthless quality.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.043
Mm-hmm.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.130
The guy he did all that to was a snitch.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.257
That exciting enough for you?

11:57.967 --> 11:59.051
I'm not afraid, Mick.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.721
And I know about a holdup.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.849
I heard a guy talking about it
at the bar this morning.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.393
-Where? When?
-Sometime this afternoon.

12:07.476 --> 12:10.020
A pawn shop on Jefferson at 143rd.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.564
-Just the one guy?
-I think so.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.241
I'm not gonna pay you for this.
You understand?

12:22.533 --> 12:25.244
If it pans out, later maybe we can talk.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.245
Oh, Mick!

12:29.081 --> 12:32.877
Oh, my, Michael.
<i>Gentlemen Prefer Leather?</i>

12:33.335 --> 12:35.004
That's evidence, hair ball.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.382
(growling)

12:43.220 --> 12:44.180
Excuse me, Captain.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.224
We picked up the suspect
in the Casteneda homicide.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.726
Good. Good work, Neal.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.270
-Everything in order on the bust?
-It seems so.

12:51.353 --> 12:52.730
Autopsy report's not in the file,

12:52.813 --> 12:54.732
but we'll run by the coroner's office
and pick up a copy.

12:54.815 --> 12:57.067
Do yourself a favor,
see Nydorf personally.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.738
MAN: Upper duodendum
contains whitish fluid,

13:01.906 --> 13:06.035
greenish-yellow bile
flows freely from orifice of common bile.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.622
Pancreas pale.

13:09.705 --> 13:12.291
Liver normal... with a certain

13:12.374 --> 13:15.628
gray cirrhotic charm. (chuckles)

13:16.670 --> 13:18.547
Found this joker in a subway john

13:18.631 --> 13:21.842
with a quart of industrial-strength
drain cleaner down his pipes.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.595
Hey, it's the holiday season.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.266
Let the record indicate
that Detective LaRue

13:29.642 --> 13:31.977
is looking a little green
around the gills.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.104
What can I do for you, guys?

13:34.188 --> 13:38.192
We never got an autopsy report
on that Casteneda homicide last month.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.569
-What's a Casteneda?
-LARUE: Ramon, T.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.739
October the 17th.
Strangulation. DOA, Mercy.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.075
Go pull it for 'em, will you, Radley?

13:47.952 --> 13:50.079
Just be a minute, guys.
Make yourself at home.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.540
Stomach distended--

13:53.666 --> 13:55.292
Contains about...

13:55.709 --> 13:59.839
150 c.c.'s of a milky fluid...

14:00.548 --> 14:04.385
somewhat of the consistency
of my wife's béarnaise sauce. (chuckles)

14:04.468 --> 14:05.803
MAN: Is deli okay for you today, sir?

14:05.886 --> 14:09.181
Yeah. Get me a pastrami on rye,

14:09.473 --> 14:12.017
side of horse radish, dill pickle,

14:12.726 --> 14:15.646
apple pie, hold the mold, and a root beer.

14:15.729 --> 14:19.400
Two chili dogs, no onions,
an order of fries and an orangeade.

14:19.733 --> 14:20.568
Hmm.

14:21.443 --> 14:22.862
Listen, Kosich, uh--

14:23.112 --> 14:24.071
Forget that pastrami.

14:24.154 --> 14:25.948
Get me three chili dogs,
everything on 'em.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.575
You guys want a sandwich or something?

14:27.908 --> 14:29.660
No thanks, Wally.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.204
I had a big breakfast, man. Thanks.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.124
Oh, do you believe this?

14:35.457 --> 14:37.877
This tape isn't even rollin'. Gradsky!

14:39.795 --> 14:43.382
I spent the better part of an hour
talkin' into a dead battery here.

14:43.465 --> 14:46.760
-I'm sure we got the digestive tract, sir.
-Kosich, will you get some batteries

14:46.844 --> 14:47.845
for this damn thing?

14:48.721 --> 14:49.680
I'll have to take it out of petty cash.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.724
Just buy the damn thing.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.604
-(whispers)
-What do you mean, you can't find 'em?

14:56.687 --> 14:58.731
Check the pending file. Check with Sylvia!

15:02.109 --> 15:03.027
Uh...

15:05.696 --> 15:07.448
It'll be all right, guys. I'll...

15:08.157 --> 15:11.035
I'll pull it for you myself.
Get it to you in a day or two.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.536
Take notes, will you, Gradsky?

15:13.329 --> 15:16.332
Uh, gall bladder... somewhat ropey fluid--

15:16.415 --> 15:17.791
Hey, look, Wally.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.085
We got a hot suspect we're
pulling into interrogation

15:20.169 --> 15:21.128
in less than two hours.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.588
Not to mention having to handle

15:22.671 --> 15:25.257
-an A.D.A. and the guy's attorney.
-I sa-- I said I'd get it to you.

15:25.341 --> 15:28.052
-All right?
-We need it now.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.137
You need...

15:31.805 --> 15:32.681
You need.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.101
Well, let me tell you what I need.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.772
Five extra pathologists, for starters,

15:39.855 --> 15:41.357
a half dozen scrubbers,

15:42.066 --> 15:44.276
ten hours extra a day in the work day...

15:44.652 --> 15:47.905
and a budget that isn't some kind
of in-house municipal joke.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.114
That's what I need.

15:50.824 --> 15:53.369
I got corpses stacked up here
till next Easter.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.705
I haven't had a lousy vacation
since Nixon was in office.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.584
And the last thing I need is a couple
of damn pushy mid-level grunts

16:00.668 --> 16:03.837
comin' in here
tellin' me how to do my job.

16:10.636 --> 16:11.470
Now, then.

16:13.722 --> 16:14.682
Gall bladder...

16:15.683 --> 16:18.394
is filled with a somewhat ropey,

16:19.144 --> 16:21.480
but otherwise clear, dark green fluid.

16:27.528 --> 16:31.240
So... what makes you so sure
I'm gonna get hit today, huh?

16:31.323 --> 16:32.616
I'm not sure.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.953
You don't even know if this snitch
of yours is on the level.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.287
No, I don't.

16:38.455 --> 16:41.583
Hey, that lunch of yours
is gonna drive my business away.

16:41.875 --> 16:42.793
Look, Murray.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.545
Why don't I just take a hike,

16:44.628 --> 16:46.672
and when this creep shows up,
you deal with him?

16:47.923 --> 16:50.384
Hey, I ain't afraid of no stickup.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.428
-Yeah. I been held up...
-(doorbell tinkles)

16:52.511 --> 16:54.430
...more than any guy on this entire block.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.597
Cheese it, Murray.

16:58.559 --> 17:03.022
How ya doin'? What do you say?
What can we do for you today?

17:03.313 --> 17:06.025
Hey, man, how about this
little thing right here?

17:06.108 --> 17:08.277
Shoot him, Belker! Blow him away!

17:13.240 --> 17:15.200
(sniffs) Murray, come here.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.250
All right. As soon as the game's over?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.502
Right. Bye. (laughs)

17:26.962 --> 17:27.796
COFFEY: What's up?

17:28.964 --> 17:30.007
Oh, nothing.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.092
I just got a date for Tisa's party tonight

17:32.176 --> 17:34.845
with a guy who plays basketball
against the Harlem Globetrotters.

17:35.721 --> 17:36.555
He's a loser.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.641
What do you mean?
You never even met the guy.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.726
He's a loser.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.811
You know, I hate it when you do this.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.564
You always do this.
The guy is only in town for three days.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.149
Paula went to all the trouble
to get me a date,

17:47.232 --> 17:48.859
and you gotta start in on him right away.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.778
I'm just stating fact, Luce.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.947
Anybody who plays
against the Trotters... losers.

18:18.305 --> 18:19.139
Hi.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.561
-Where did you find it?
-At the foot of the bed--

18:24.895 --> 18:27.314
under two sheets and an electric blanket.

18:28.023 --> 18:30.109
Funny how things disappear
when you're having a good time.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.905
I see you pulled the Edwards case.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.575
It appears from this arrest report
I've got my work cut out for me.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.869
We have everything we need.
We can go to trial next week.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.708
There's nothing worse
than a gloating Italian.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.878
MAN: 1042 Elmwood Avenue.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.296
Apartment 22.

18:52.506 --> 18:53.340
DAVENPORT: Hmm.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.592
Apartment number again?

18:56.385 --> 18:57.886
Twenty-two.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.347
Present occupation?

19:00.889 --> 19:03.433
Starting quarterback
for the Atlanta Falcons.

19:04.017 --> 19:07.688
Let's just skip the preliminaries
and get down to basics.

19:08.272 --> 19:11.024
-Now what kind of deal can you cut for me?
-Mr. Edwards--

19:11.108 --> 19:13.694
Don't "Mr. Edwards" me, P.D.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.738
Now, you can't cut me a deal,

19:17.865 --> 19:20.033
I'll find me a real lawyer who can.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.661
There's no point in discussing a deal
at this time

19:22.744 --> 19:26.248
if we can even circumstantially establish
your innocence in the matter.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.833
Well, good luck, lady.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.252
Shall I interpret that
as an admission of guilt?

19:31.587 --> 19:33.213
What difference does it make?

19:33.714 --> 19:37.092
It makes a big difference
in how I approach your defense.

19:39.303 --> 19:42.514
Of course, if you're not entirely
comfortable discussing it at this time...

19:42.848 --> 19:44.433
I'm plenty comfortable.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.143
-Did you do it?
-No.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.271
No, I didn't.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.274
As a matter of fact,
I was in El Salvador that week...

19:52.566 --> 19:54.902
doing some charity work for the Red Cross.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.863
Mr. Edwards, I'm not in the mood today

19:57.946 --> 20:00.032
for sarcastic, adolescent bullying

20:00.115 --> 20:03.160
from someone who ought
to be thankful I'm trying to help him.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.579
I'll have you reassigned.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.415
Hey, lady. Wait.

20:11.084 --> 20:12.836
While you're at it, Ray,
get me A.D.A. Bernstein.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.255
Got a real potential horror story
on our hands, Frank.

20:15.339 --> 20:18.050
I told you, eight men
for crowd control is insufficient.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.636
That's just as much
your responsibility, Anderson.

20:20.719 --> 20:24.139
I never recommended a visit
to this precinct in the first place, sir.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.682
Went down 20 minutes ago

20:25.766 --> 20:27.517
at the governor's Dekker Avenue
whistle-stop.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.937
-Took him right out of the limousine.
-For God's sake, man.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.813
-Do you mind?
-Took who?

20:31.897 --> 20:34.608
-They took the governor?
-Not the governor, Ray, Lamont.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.486
-Lamont?
-Somebody took the governor's wife's dog?

20:37.569 --> 20:38.528
Read my lips, Frank.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.448
She became absolutely hysterical
when she found out.

20:41.531 --> 20:44.117
Had to be sedated right in front
of the Channel 10 minicam.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.912
Now, we're gonna have to mobilize
on this one, and I mean fast.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.623
I don't need to tell you the crisis
of confidence we'll be facing

20:49.706 --> 20:52.918
when it gets out that the largest
metro squad in the entire state

20:53.001 --> 20:56.797
can't even insure the basic human rights
of a nine-pound Lhasa Apso.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.050
Anderson here from the governor's office
is gonna keep a lid on the media flow.

21:00.133 --> 21:03.720
LaRue? Washington?
Get in here. You too, Goldstein.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.306
-Goldblume.
-First off, we'll need a door-to-door

21:06.390 --> 21:07.808
in the vicinity of the snatch.

21:08.475 --> 21:09.643
Howard. Phil.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.313
And a couple of your desk boys
to handle the phone calls.

21:13.647 --> 21:14.481
What phone calls?

21:14.856 --> 21:17.025
The governor has approved
a $1,000 reward

21:17.109 --> 21:18.402
for Lamont's safe return.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.779
It's going out over the local airwaves
within the hour.

21:21.029 --> 21:23.657
-Who's Lamont?
-You're gonna use precinct phones

21:23.740 --> 21:25.826
for some lost dog reward?

21:26.201 --> 21:27.327
Give me a little credit, Frank.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.830
We'll just run a couple of extensions
off of your private line.

21:30.414 --> 21:34.668
Now. We'll need 12 uniforms
for a perimeter search, Phil.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.962
Eight EATers, Howard. Not a man less.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.505
You just hold on a minute.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.134
I have three homicide investigations
in the works, five rapes,

21:42.217 --> 21:45.137
several dozen assaults,
and miscellaneous other felonies

21:45.220 --> 21:47.848
and a continuing incoming tally
of all of the above,

21:47.931 --> 21:49.308
and you expect me

21:49.391 --> 21:53.437
to devote fully one-third
of my active day shift

21:53.520 --> 21:56.315
to some overbred lapdog?

21:56.398 --> 21:58.442
(sighs) We're not talking dog, Frank.

21:58.525 --> 22:01.820
We're talking image,
and image-wise, like it or not,

22:02.112 --> 22:05.282
this overbred lapdog's
got a higher gubernatorial profile

22:05.365 --> 22:07.576
than the state bird,
whatever the hell it is.

22:07.659 --> 22:08.994
Uh, swallow, I believe, Chief.

22:09.077 --> 22:11.872
-Peregrine falcon. Falcon peregrine?
-(phone rings)

22:11.955 --> 22:13.874
Hello? Just a minute, please.

22:13.957 --> 22:18.211
Well, image-wise, how do you suppose
the electorate of this state

22:18.295 --> 22:21.131
is gonna take such gross expenditure?

22:21.214 --> 22:22.549
Got a handle on it, Frank.

22:22.632 --> 22:25.677
-Frank, line six.
-Not now, Ray.

22:26.428 --> 22:29.806
In addition, men,
I'm authorizing overtime funds

22:29.890 --> 22:32.434
for all necessary personnel
for as long as this takes.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.852
Up to 20 grand, let's say.

22:33.935 --> 22:36.188
Frank, I think you might want
to take this call.

22:37.981 --> 22:40.317
-Furillo.
-And I swear, Anderson,

22:41.443 --> 22:44.571
if these figures leak out
to those local media flacks,

22:45.113 --> 22:47.074
it's gonna be your butt
on the waffle iron...

22:47.157 --> 22:49.326
-right alongside mine.
-Yeah, Vince, what?

22:49.743 --> 22:52.746
Sidebar stories only, Chief.
Human interest.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.207
-No stats on appropriations.
-Right. I understand.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.124
Yeah. Sure.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.462
All right, men, let's get to it.

23:04.341 --> 23:07.135
-Judas Priest. The man can't be serious.
-You heard him.

23:07.677 --> 23:08.887
I'll be back in an hour, Phil.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.475
Uh, Captain? About the Casteneda homicide.

23:13.558 --> 23:17.020
It seems they can't locate
the autopsy report down at the C.O.'s.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.314
It's a regular three-ring circus
down there, Captain.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.650
Nydorf practically blew a gasket
when we pressed him for it.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.276
I'm on my way downtown anyway.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.444
I'll pick it up on the way back.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.989
Uh, Francis, aside from the obvious
canine situation,

23:28.073 --> 23:30.617
-is everything all right?
-(sighs) Yeah. Just great, Phil.

23:32.994 --> 23:35.414
Fay got herself thrown into jail
down at traffic court.

23:35.497 --> 23:38.500
-Judge is holding her in contempt.
-Oh.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.592
Captain Furillo. Thank you.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.220
FAY: Frank, before you say anything,

23:50.470 --> 23:53.682
I have never been treated
so rudely in my whole life.

23:54.015 --> 23:57.185
-The arrogance, the open hostility.
-What did you do?

23:57.269 --> 23:58.812
Me? Nothing.

23:59.104 --> 24:02.232
I just came down to court to plead
my innocence, like an American citizen.

24:02.315 --> 24:05.110
And got yourself thrown
into jail on account of a traffic ticket?

24:05.193 --> 24:06.820
You must have done something
out of the ordinary.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.989
-Said something?
-Sure.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.116
If you count exercising
your free speech

24:11.199 --> 24:14.411
in this supposedly free country
something out of the ordinary.

24:14.494 --> 24:18.081
-What did you call him, Fay?
-Frank, he kept interrupting me.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.916
(stammers) He wouldn't look
at my pictures.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.044
-So you...
-Well, I might have implied

24:23.128 --> 24:26.673
that he had an unnaturally
close relationship with his mother.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.468
Well, can you blame me? I was upset.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.386
Court is gonna close in a couple of hours.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.596
If you don't apologize right now,

24:32.679 --> 24:34.931
you're gonna be stuck
in there until tomorrow morning.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.851
-Well, bail me out.
-No.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.187
Contempt of court is not bailable.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.314
You're in until you apologize.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.816
Well, thank you very much, mister.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.152
Then I'm gonna stay right here.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.657
I'm not without internal resources, Frank.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.367
I'll write an article...

24:55.202 --> 24:57.204
about the abuses of judicial power.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.622
I-I'll go on a hunger strike.

25:00.415 --> 25:03.668
I'm not gonna argue the possible
salutary effects of a hunger strike.

25:04.169 --> 25:07.047
-Are you saying I'm overweight?
-I'm simply say--

25:07.464 --> 25:09.466
Fay, I don't have time for this.

25:09.716 --> 25:10.926
If you want to play Joan of Arc

25:11.009 --> 25:12.886
on account of a traffic ticket,
be my guest,

25:12.969 --> 25:14.638
but I'm gonna take Frank Jr. home with me,

25:14.721 --> 25:16.640
and you can stay in here until you rot.

25:19.601 --> 25:22.729
How about I come over to your cell
and keep you company, sweet pea?

25:23.647 --> 25:24.523
Frank!

25:27.234 --> 25:28.109
Frank!

25:31.279 --> 25:33.281
-What do you think of the captain?
-He's okay.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.158
Seems like a real straight arrow, though.

25:35.242 --> 25:38.662
-At least he knew our names.
-(chuckles) That was really nice,

25:38.745 --> 25:41.331
Sergeant Esterhaus asking us
what we like to be called.

25:42.666 --> 25:46.044
Esterhaus-- He looks like
he must have been a real tough one.

25:46.127 --> 25:47.504
Looks like he's still tough.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.340
Do you really think
we should go to that party tonight?

25:50.966 --> 25:52.884
-Sure.
-I mean, do you think

25:52.968 --> 25:54.427
they were just trying to be polite?

25:54.511 --> 25:56.137
Aw, come on. We're gonna be working
with these guys.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.515
-They invited us. I mean--
-MAN: Police! Hey, police!

25:58.598 --> 26:01.268
Over here, quick!
He's beating up my brother, man.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.353
Hey! He's beating up my brother.

26:03.436 --> 26:05.105
Come back here. My brother's bad.

26:05.647 --> 26:09.442
-(blues plays on jukebox)
-(clamoring)

26:09.526 --> 26:10.944
All right, break it up! Police. Come on!

26:11.027 --> 26:12.404
You wanna butt in? You wanna take my--

26:13.238 --> 26:15.865
-(snarls)
-Come on! Come on, Crawford!

26:19.202 --> 26:21.037
-Crawford, come on, man.
-Come on, move back.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.581
Move back! Move back!

26:23.290 --> 26:24.124
Come on, break it up!

26:26.876 --> 26:27.961
(shouting)

26:30.422 --> 26:34.593
-(shouting)
-(snarling)

26:34.676 --> 26:36.386
Crawford! Come on, man! Do something.

26:36.469 --> 26:40.348
Come on, get off him. Get off him.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.349
Crawford!

26:45.353 --> 26:46.229
MAN: The bartender.

26:52.277 --> 26:55.614
You're a great guy, Officer,
the way you help your buddy out.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.120
Mrs. Furillo?

27:05.457 --> 27:07.792
Do you have something that you wish
to say to this court?

27:10.211 --> 27:11.046
No.

27:13.089 --> 27:14.883
Approach the bench, Mrs. Furillo.

27:20.013 --> 27:23.808
I've been a traffic court judge
for slightly more than seven months now,

27:24.392 --> 27:26.603
and this is the first time
the need has arisen

27:26.686 --> 27:28.480
to incarcerate a citizen.

27:29.022 --> 27:31.399
Well, maybe it's the first time

27:31.483 --> 27:33.610
that a citizen has ever stood up to you.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.780
Mrs. Furillo, if you continue
to behave before this court--

27:36.863 --> 27:38.865
You know, I'll bet you're like this
at home, aren't you?

27:39.240 --> 27:40.533
You wanna know what's wrong with you?

27:40.992 --> 27:44.037
You don't know how to back down
or admit you're wrong.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.705
It's a way to lose a marriage, mister.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.333
Mrs. Furillo, aside from the fact

27:48.416 --> 27:50.627
that you have mistaken
my present marital condition,

27:50.710 --> 27:54.297
may I remind you that you have
already spent some time in the clink,

27:54.381 --> 27:55.632
-and I'd be more than--
-See?

27:56.841 --> 27:59.469
Well, let me tell you something, mister.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.554
I have a case here.

28:01.930 --> 28:05.642
I have facts, I have pictures
and I know what I know.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.937
Now, if I have to go to jail,
I'll go to jail,

28:09.187 --> 28:11.189
but I am not gonna grovel around here

28:11.272 --> 28:12.941
-just because you're some--
-(chuckling)

28:13.024 --> 28:16.653
-(laughing)
-What's so funny?

28:17.904 --> 28:20.407
You are. You're a real pistol, lady.

28:23.910 --> 28:26.287
(laughter continues)

28:26.663 --> 28:27.497
(clears throat)

28:28.164 --> 28:30.208
(laughing) I'm sorry.

28:31.000 --> 28:31.835
(clears throat)

28:33.086 --> 28:37.841
Mrs. Furillo-- (laughs)

28:41.553 --> 28:42.637
We're both very tired,

28:43.972 --> 28:45.265
and it's late and, uh--

28:45.515 --> 28:47.851
Well, anybody that's willing
to spend a week in jail...

28:48.309 --> 28:50.145
-A week?
-...must either be a glutton

28:50.228 --> 28:54.190
for punishment or very sure
of the rightness of her position, so...

28:56.192 --> 28:57.235
What have you got?

28:58.403 --> 28:59.237
Well--

29:00.572 --> 29:03.199
I was on my way home from the supermarket,

29:03.283 --> 29:05.243
completely minding my own business,

29:05.326 --> 29:09.038
when some jack-booted highway patrol jerk
on his fascist motorcycle

29:09.122 --> 29:11.541
hauled me over for allegedly

29:12.250 --> 29:16.004
not making a left-hand turn
in a mandatory left-hand turn lane.

29:16.671 --> 29:18.882
This is Officer Bruzinsky,
the arresting officer.

29:18.965 --> 29:20.967
Well, wait a minute.
I got a better one than that. Here.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.972
What's the name of that, uh,
stiff again, Frank?

29:26.055 --> 29:27.974
Casteneda. Ramon Casteneda.

29:28.057 --> 29:30.477
Casteneda. Casteneda.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.062
Casteneda.

29:34.814 --> 29:36.399
Casteneda.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.359
We never sent you an autopsy report.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.111
Sylvia!

29:43.239 --> 29:44.324
Sylvia.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.454
Can you believe this place, Frank? Sylvia!

29:50.830 --> 29:53.208
Woman's been here almost
as long as I have. She's worthless.

29:54.876 --> 29:59.297
You know, in 1972, we had
an operating budget of 1.2 million.

30:00.423 --> 30:03.218
Ten years later we're operating on 1.3.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.970
Can't get decent people anymore.

30:06.679 --> 30:07.972
We're dying down here.

30:09.849 --> 30:13.311
Oh, I don't know. Sylvia's all right.
She-- (chuckles)

30:16.523 --> 30:17.357
Here.

30:19.025 --> 30:21.110
-What's that?
-What do you think it is?

30:21.653 --> 30:24.364
It's Noogie Fisher's ear. Remember?

30:25.156 --> 30:27.200
We sent Teddy Jakes away for 50 years.

30:27.283 --> 30:30.662
All we had was Noogie's ear
in the glove compartment.

30:30.745 --> 30:32.831
You were the homicide detective.
Remember that?

30:33.581 --> 30:36.292
Here. You wanna keep it, go ahead.

30:36.376 --> 30:38.461
-Walt.
-Sylvia!

30:39.546 --> 30:41.756
Wally, look. This is my situation.

30:42.465 --> 30:45.677
We're due in court day
after tomorrow for the preliminary,

30:46.010 --> 30:48.471
and the D.A.'s office
is really pressing me for this autopsy.

30:49.430 --> 30:50.348
Uh--

30:51.724 --> 30:55.061
Well, Frank... it's gotta
be around here somewhere.

30:55.144 --> 30:57.730
I'll, uh-- I'll dig it out.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.568
And I'll have it on your desk
at 5 o'clock today, okay?

31:03.403 --> 31:04.320
And, uh,

31:05.530 --> 31:06.364
Frank--

31:08.700 --> 31:11.202
I really feel terrible about this morning.

31:12.579 --> 31:16.457
I mean, I jumped all over your guys
for just trying to do their job.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.087
-You tell 'em for me, would you?
-Yeah, I will.

31:21.170 --> 31:25.842
-Five o'clock, right, Wally?
-On your desk. Promise. Okay, kid?

31:25.925 --> 31:27.594
-I'll appreciate it.
-Okay.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.311
-FURILLO: Ray. Ray.
-CALLETANO: Yes, Frank?

31:37.562 --> 31:40.857
Seems the reward offer
has sparked community interest.

31:41.190 --> 31:43.526
They emptied out the kennels.

31:44.485 --> 31:47.447
Hey, so-so what do you think, huh?

31:48.698 --> 31:50.909
Could this be that "A" dog
you've been looking for?

31:50.992 --> 31:53.328
You have glued hair to his skin.

31:53.411 --> 31:54.329
Oh, yeah, yeah.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.664
-You think it's too much, huh?
-Yes.

31:57.373 --> 32:00.293
No, it's, uh-- The dog's got
a skin condition, you know?

32:00.376 --> 32:03.046
The doctor told me what to get,
but I can't afford it.

32:03.129 --> 32:04.505
Ray, clear them all out of here,
would you?

32:04.589 --> 32:06.090
Yo, come on. She could really

32:06.174 --> 32:07.175
-learn to love it.
-Get out!

32:07.258 --> 32:08.468
Come on. Come on, get out.

32:08.551 --> 32:10.553
It's a dog-eat-dog world, pizza man.

32:10.637 --> 32:13.431
(dogs barking)

32:13.514 --> 32:15.683
Yeah. How much?

32:17.393 --> 32:18.227
Where?

32:19.270 --> 32:20.772
You have the dog with you?

32:21.439 --> 32:23.066
Okay, listen. Who am I talking to here?

32:24.108 --> 32:26.194
No, the governor
is not available right now.

32:26.694 --> 32:27.862
Well, can you prove you have the dog?

32:27.946 --> 32:29.906
Can you make him bark for me?

32:35.495 --> 32:37.872
-I think they may have him, Frank.
-In my office.

32:39.832 --> 32:43.294
They say they want $10,000
in old bills...

32:43.628 --> 32:47.256
left in a phone booth at 114th
and Shattuck in one hour,

32:47.674 --> 32:48.967
or they shoot the dog.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.885
-No cops.
-Let's pay it.

32:53.888 --> 32:56.140
-You've gotta be kidding.
-The hell I am.

32:56.391 --> 32:57.475
Just keep the press away.

32:57.558 --> 33:00.144
You're crazy if you think
this story won't leak out,

33:00.228 --> 33:01.813
in addition to which, I'll scrub your feet

33:01.896 --> 33:03.564
in the window of Kirby's Department Store

33:03.648 --> 33:06.317
if any part of that cockamamie phone call
pans out.

33:08.486 --> 33:10.863
Henry, I want the gangs
in here by 4:00 for a meeting.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.908
Thank you for your input, Captain.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.994
I can't afford
to have Lamont getting shot.

33:18.871 --> 33:23.042
Hi. Can I have area code 311-555-9600.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.800
What's this? What's this?

33:31.134 --> 33:32.885
What are you doing to me?

33:34.178 --> 33:36.347
I leave the shop for two minutes,

33:36.431 --> 33:39.475
and I come back and I find you're
dealing me out of house and home.

33:40.143 --> 33:41.102
Look at this.

33:41.728 --> 33:45.189
Cameras. Radios. Mixers.

33:46.482 --> 33:51.029
Somebody don't hold me up soon,
I'm gonna have to file for bankruptcy.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.614
Murray, I got the whole schmear
for 186 bucks...

33:53.698 --> 33:56.451
from a Cuban bookie
headed upstate on a two-to-four.

33:56.993 --> 33:59.203
A hundred and eighty-six bucks?

33:59.287 --> 34:00.121
That's right.

34:01.247 --> 34:04.459
All of this? 186 bucks?

34:04.542 --> 34:05.501
(chuckles)

34:07.045 --> 34:07.920
You know, son,

34:08.629 --> 34:11.674
if you ever decide to give up
this detective business,

34:12.842 --> 34:14.093
-the pawn industry can offer you...
-(doorbell tinkles)

34:14.177 --> 34:16.012
...a very rewarding future.

34:16.095 --> 34:17.597
I'm gonna keep that in mind, Murray.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.061
MURRAY: Oh, how you doing?
What can we do for you?

34:24.103 --> 34:26.105
Thinking about pawning
my electric guitar...

34:26.647 --> 34:27.607
if the price is right.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.776
Well, that depends. (chuckles)

34:29.859 --> 34:32.403
I mean, what are we talking?
A Fender? A Gretsch?

34:32.487 --> 34:35.073
Stratocaster? Six-string, 12-string...

34:35.490 --> 34:38.409
Twelve-gauge, Smith &amp; Wesson,
two barrels, one trigger.

34:38.701 --> 34:41.746
And believe me, it's in tune.
Hands on the counter, shortstop.

34:42.288 --> 34:43.539
All the money, now.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.793
Now, or I'll take your face off
with this thing.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.883
(snarling)

34:58.596 --> 35:01.099
You want cream
with your coffee, dog breath?

35:03.726 --> 35:07.188
-What was that again? "Lasso apso"?
-(laughter)

35:07.980 --> 35:11.067
-Or was it "Lassie Apsy"?
-(laughter)

35:11.150 --> 35:13.277
Say that for me four times, Furillo.

35:13.361 --> 35:17.657
-"Lamu aspo."
-No, man. It's "lapu zapu."

35:17.740 --> 35:19.742
Lhasa Apso is the breed.

35:20.326 --> 35:22.453
All we want is your cooperation.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.914
Uh, what is the dog's name? Jerry?

35:25.248 --> 35:27.375
-Sid?
-Dog's name is Lamont.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.710
-Say what?
-Hey, Furillo.

35:30.253 --> 35:32.547
How am I gonna tell my people "Lamont"?

35:32.630 --> 35:34.423
Does the mutt have a nickname?

35:35.550 --> 35:37.969
-I got a brother named Lamont.
-Yeah!

35:38.052 --> 35:39.971
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I know about your brother.

35:40.054 --> 35:42.849
-Yeah.
-We all know about Lamont.

35:50.857 --> 35:51.983
-What?
-Hey. Hey.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.609
Oh, what. What.

35:53.693 --> 35:57.738
Guys, this is a very important animal
we're talking about.

35:58.322 --> 36:01.534
This animal is a token of friendship
from the people of Tibet.

36:03.035 --> 36:05.163
(clears throat) I put
to you two scenarios, gentlemen.

36:05.246 --> 36:09.041
In the first,
a civic-minded citizen or citizens

36:09.375 --> 36:13.379
step forward, no questions asked,
and receive a $1,000 reward.

36:13.462 --> 36:17.800
In the second, a $10,000 ransom
is presented to that same citizen,

36:17.884 --> 36:20.469
who then gets three years upstate
as a bonus.

36:20.553 --> 36:23.139
I get the impression
you're implying gang involvement

36:23.222 --> 36:25.349
in this canine affair.

36:25.433 --> 36:29.228
I'm simply implying, Jesus,
that whoever stole that animal

36:29.312 --> 36:30.897
will be inordinately punished,

36:30.980 --> 36:34.025
considering the vast resources
we've devoted to this problem.

36:34.442 --> 36:38.279
I do grudgingly admire your initiative,
not to mention your sense of humor.

36:39.739 --> 36:41.490
That abortive little
phone booth caper, okay,

36:41.574 --> 36:43.701
but I think it's time
to talk turkey, don't you?

36:44.202 --> 36:46.913
Or, as the case seems to be, canine.

36:47.955 --> 36:48.998
If anybody knows anything,

36:49.081 --> 36:51.083
I want to hear about it
by 9 o'clock tomorrow.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.877
ANDERSON: Please, guys,
try to keep perspective.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.964
In one sense, Lamont is Mrs. Sandler's,
but in a larger sense,

36:57.381 --> 36:59.258
-he belongs to all of us.
-Yeah?

36:59.884 --> 37:03.596
What part of this dog
belongs to Mr. Martinez?

37:03.679 --> 37:05.806
-(murmuring)
-MAN: I'll see you outside.

37:05.890 --> 37:09.644
-Outside. Outside.
-(chattering)

37:11.520 --> 37:12.730
Anything you want.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.065
BELKER: Captain?

37:19.070 --> 37:22.114
I wanna give Eddie Gregg 50 bucks.

37:22.198 --> 37:24.033
I think it's cheap dollars, Captain.

37:24.116 --> 37:26.494
He's the one that gave me
the pawnshop bust this afternoon.

37:28.955 --> 37:29.830
CALLETANO: Hold on just a second.

37:31.123 --> 37:32.124
Thank you, Captain.

37:32.625 --> 37:35.795
Frank, the D.A.'s office on line four.

37:36.295 --> 37:38.130
Did we get the autopsy report from Nydorf?

37:38.214 --> 37:41.300
-Yes. It just came in.
-Oh. Great. Thank you.

37:41.884 --> 37:44.345
Yeah, Irwin. Uh-huh. I just got it.

37:44.845 --> 37:46.180
I'm just looking at it, Irwin.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.183
Well, I can have somebody
bring it down to you. Yeah. Sure.

37:52.061 --> 37:55.439
No. Yeah-- Irwin, listen.
I've got a crisis on my hands here.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.149
I'll-I'll call you back, all right?

37:57.942 --> 37:59.151
I'll call you back, Irwin.

37:59.902 --> 38:00.736
Yeah.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.702
Here's your 50 bucks. Now get lost.

38:07.785 --> 38:08.828
When will I see you again?

38:10.079 --> 38:10.913
How should I know?

38:10.997 --> 38:13.416
Mick, I've got something
really big for you.

38:13.499 --> 38:16.127
We could have a late supper
after I get off work and talk about it.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.921
Look, hair bag, you're gonna be a snitch,

38:19.005 --> 38:21.048
you never want to be seen
in public with me.

38:21.424 --> 38:24.176
And you especially
never want to be seen up here.

38:24.885 --> 38:26.137
Then how do I get in touch with you?

38:29.807 --> 38:31.100
Call me at this number.

38:33.102 --> 38:33.936
Wait a minute.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.236
You could call me at my home phone too.

38:43.571 --> 38:45.573
I'll keep this in strictest confidence,
Mick.

38:45.656 --> 38:46.490
When can we meet?

38:46.866 --> 38:48.576
I don't know. Maybe tomorrow.

38:48.659 --> 38:50.995
-Tell me where.
-I don't know. Someplace.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.621
I don't know right now.

38:52.705 --> 38:55.708
It's gotta be someplace, uh,
dark, out of the way--

38:56.083 --> 38:59.754
-Oh!
-Like a parking garage, you dirt ball.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.715
Sounds good to me, Mick.
I'll call you first thing in the a.m.

39:02.798 --> 39:03.674
You won't regret it.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.889
Frank, Nydorf left for the day.

39:09.972 --> 39:10.848
You want me to try his house?

39:10.931 --> 39:12.475
No, I think I know where I can find him.

39:13.934 --> 39:16.729
And the mortuary guy says,
"Let me check my inventory.

39:17.104 --> 39:19.023
I may need some mortuary blankets."

39:20.816 --> 39:21.776
-Hey, Frank.
-Wally.

39:21.859 --> 39:23.152
Be with you in a minute, kid.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.571
So he leaves, goes upstairs.

39:25.654 --> 39:27.615
He leaves the poor slob alone
with the stiff.

39:27.698 --> 39:28.991
(laughter)

39:29.075 --> 39:32.453
He-he's trying not to look,
but he's scared out of his tree.

39:32.912 --> 39:36.290
And all of a sudden the stiff goes--
(blows raspberries)

39:36.832 --> 39:38.334
And sits bolt upright.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.004
The kid--

39:42.880 --> 39:45.716
The kid drops his briefcase--
his sample case.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.344
He runs out of there,
gets in his car, drives away...

39:48.427 --> 39:50.096
and he's never been seen since.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.140
It's a true story. Swear to God.

39:54.517 --> 39:55.643
Wally, could I talk to you for a minute?

39:55.726 --> 39:57.478
Oh, sure, Frank.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.564
Come on. Let's get a table.

40:01.690 --> 40:02.525
Excuse me.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.361
-Hey, you want a beer?
-Oh, no, thanks.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.696
Oh, that's right. Hey, Ace.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.241
-MAN: Yeah, you want another one?
-Uh, and a soda.

40:10.324 --> 40:13.202
-Yeah, I'll send it over.
-(chuckling) I don't know, Frank.

40:14.537 --> 40:17.039
I've been cuttin' up stiffs for 35 years.

40:17.373 --> 40:20.668
I come to bars and tell stories
about dead bodies.

40:22.545 --> 40:25.464
You think that indicates
a certain narrowness of interest?

40:25.923 --> 40:27.508
Uh, we have a problem, Wally.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.927
-Uh-huh. What about?
-The autopsy.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.972
-Uh-huh. So talk to me.
-Talk to<i> me.</i>

40:33.764 --> 40:34.807
This is a mess.

40:35.641 --> 40:37.893
If I tried to sell this
at Edwards' preliminary,

40:37.977 --> 40:39.478
they're gonna laugh me right out of court.

40:39.562 --> 40:41.939
Who the hell are you to question my work?

40:42.314 --> 40:44.150
Don't try to pull the same crap with me

40:44.233 --> 40:46.193
as you tried to pull
with my detectives this morning.

40:46.986 --> 40:49.155
This report is indefensible,
and you know it.

40:49.864 --> 40:51.282
The physical description is sketchy,

40:51.365 --> 40:53.325
there's no blood workup at all...

40:53.701 --> 40:55.661
and the diagrams are totally inadequate.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.247
How did you do this? From memory?

41:00.666 --> 41:03.878
You lost the originals,
and then you lost the copies,

41:03.961 --> 41:06.255
and so you figured,
"What the hell. I'll wing it." Right?

41:08.132 --> 41:09.133
Tell me I'm wrong.

41:09.550 --> 41:10.885
All right, Frank.

41:12.178 --> 41:13.012
Okay.

41:15.264 --> 41:17.516
But you saw what a zoo that place is.

41:19.602 --> 41:21.854
Look, you just send me your police report.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.940
Give me 24 hours,
and I'll give you an autopsy.

41:25.024 --> 41:27.234
Swear to God, you'll be able
to convict your mother on it.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.528
-That's not good enough.
-Well, what then?

41:29.612 --> 41:31.322
-I want you to pull him up.
-Oh, Frank.

41:31.405 --> 41:33.657
-Pull him up and do it again.
-Frank...

41:34.700 --> 41:37.953
Did you ever do an autopsy
on a three-week-old stiff?

41:38.037 --> 41:38.871
Wally.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.833
Wally, you used to like your work,
and you were the best.

41:42.917 --> 41:46.003
-What happened?
-Now, don't you start with me, Frank.

41:48.339 --> 41:51.425
I knew you when you were
a 24-year-old snot-nose

41:51.509 --> 41:55.095
whose main area of expertise
was the inside of a shot glass,

41:55.179 --> 41:58.182
so don't go getting your glands
in an uproar with me, kid.

41:59.808 --> 42:01.519
Just do your job, Wally.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.611
RENKO: I'd like to propose another toast

42:10.694 --> 42:13.948
to the short, black-haired, brown-eyed,

42:14.031 --> 42:17.159
graduating class from the police academy

42:17.243 --> 42:18.744
to Sergeant Esterhaus's finest.

42:18.827 --> 42:19.870
<i>-¡Salud!</i>
-WOMAN: Cheers.

42:19.954 --> 42:22.164
-And I'd like to propose another toast--
-Hey, just rest the toast.

42:22.248 --> 42:24.750
You rest. To the prettiest lady...

42:25.167 --> 42:27.294
that ever graced this sorry side
of the tracks,

42:27.378 --> 42:29.505
here's to slumming with the city's finest.

42:31.006 --> 42:31.840
Drink up.

42:34.677 --> 42:37.638
Come on, Teresa. Don't be a wet old rag.

42:37.721 --> 42:38.806
I've had enough, Andy.

42:38.889 --> 42:40.349
-What?
-I have had enough.

42:40.432 --> 42:43.310
Well, excuse me, lady. "I've had enough."

42:43.394 --> 42:45.479
I would have had
the Dom Perignon out here,

42:45.563 --> 42:47.982
but my credit line's
a little short right now.

42:48.315 --> 42:51.819
Come on, Rapunzel.
Let down your blond hair.

42:52.069 --> 42:53.821
Let down your blond hair.

42:54.738 --> 42:56.824
I got less hair to let down.

42:59.201 --> 43:00.911
"I got less hair to let down."

43:00.995 --> 43:03.163
I love you, Joe. I love you.

43:03.247 --> 43:05.416
Coffey says this guy
used to work for the sewer department.

43:05.499 --> 43:08.669
You know, he knows all 80 miles
of the system like the back of his hand.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.754
Claims he goes after anything
with a badge too.

43:10.838 --> 43:14.216
Well, makes sense,
if you heard the dude's story.

43:14.300 --> 43:17.803
-What story is that?
-Well, back in 1978,

43:17.886 --> 43:21.140
this married lady and midtown sergeant

43:21.223 --> 43:23.601
were found hacked to death in a flophouse

43:23.684 --> 43:26.562
-over in East Utica.
-Buck whole naked.

43:26.979 --> 43:28.981
Warrants went out for the husband.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.859
WOMAN: Oh, you mean
that guy Travis Pogrow.

43:31.942 --> 43:36.530
-Yeah. We heard about him over in midtown.
-6'5", 285 pounds--

43:36.614 --> 43:40.034
Disappeared without a trace. Sewer worker.

43:40.117 --> 43:43.245
Wait, wait. And they think
this Travis Pogrow is the Phantom?

43:44.079 --> 43:44.913
What do you think?

43:46.957 --> 43:49.335
Give me a break.
There's no Phantom down there.

43:49.418 --> 43:52.046
Oh, of course there ain't, Hernandez.

43:52.129 --> 43:55.132
I got this right here
fallin' off of my skateboard.

43:55.674 --> 43:58.052
-You mean the Phantom did that?
-This? No, no, no.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.219
This was Marie Osmond.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.640
This freak pulls my leg

44:02.723 --> 44:05.267
halfway down a storm drain
on Richmond last year.

44:05.351 --> 44:06.685
If he'd have chopped
the rest of it off at the knee...

44:06.769 --> 44:08.228
-Is this the freeway?
-...he would've been my partner.

44:27.331 --> 44:28.290
What was that for?

44:29.208 --> 44:31.794
Thank you.
That was very sweet of you back there.

44:33.545 --> 44:35.297
I got lipstick all over.

44:35.798 --> 44:38.592
Hey. Cut it out.
What the hell is goin' on here?

44:39.468 --> 44:42.888
Uh, this is a slightly drunken
come-on, I guess. (chuckles)

44:43.681 --> 44:45.474
-Hmm?
-Oh...

44:47.184 --> 44:48.268
Look, Teresa,

44:49.186 --> 44:50.979
you're a very lovely lady,

44:51.063 --> 44:52.690
and I like you a lot,

44:53.524 --> 44:55.734
but, you know, Renko's my friend.

44:56.735 --> 44:57.945
I like you a lot too.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.489
Wait, wait. Now just cut it out.

45:01.490 --> 45:02.700
Look, you're his girl.

45:03.951 --> 45:05.494
Well, what if I wasn't? Hmm?

45:14.503 --> 45:16.839
CRAWFORD: I just want to thank you
for covering for me, okay?

45:16.922 --> 45:17.923
HERNANDEZ: I didn't cover for you.

45:18.257 --> 45:20.926
Look. Tomorrow's gonna be different.
I know it.

45:22.428 --> 45:23.262
I'm sorry.

45:24.138 --> 45:25.889
I asked Esterhaus for a new partner.

45:28.225 --> 45:30.769
-That's it. I've had it.
-What?

45:31.353 --> 45:32.938
Don't you think I've waited long enough
for the creep?

45:34.064 --> 45:35.941
Oh, your basketball player
hasn't shown up yet?

45:36.024 --> 45:38.193
That is the last time I ever call a jock.

45:38.277 --> 45:39.528
Hey, come on. Let's have a drink.

45:39.611 --> 45:41.780
-I don't want a drink.
-Excuse me. Are you Lucy?

45:42.322 --> 45:44.908
I'm Doug. Doug Munson.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.869
-Oh.
-I'm sorry I'm late.

45:46.952 --> 45:48.245
The game went double overtime.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.247
Oh! How'd you do?

45:50.914 --> 45:52.166
-We lost.
-Oh.

45:53.083 --> 45:56.253
-Uh, this is my friend Joe Coffey.
-Doug Munson.

45:56.336 --> 45:59.173
He says that you've had quite
a long losing streak.

45:59.798 --> 46:01.467
1912 games.

46:02.301 --> 46:03.844
I've got a table over here.

46:08.474 --> 46:10.309
Everybody's looking.

46:12.060 --> 46:12.895
Who's looking?

46:14.146 --> 46:17.107
-Hmm?
-Oh, I don't know.

46:17.357 --> 46:18.692
You know.

46:21.111 --> 46:23.113
Then why don't we go someplace where...

46:24.990 --> 46:26.116
nobody can look?

46:32.206 --> 46:33.040
Okay.

46:40.589 --> 46:43.175
<i>And finally tonight, Ray,</i>
<i>on the local front,</i>

46:43.258 --> 46:46.595
<i>the latest poop on the case</i>
<i>of the missing Lhasa Apso.</i>

46:47.054 --> 46:49.973
<i>As of this hour,</i>
<i>no suspects have yet been collared</i>

46:50.057 --> 46:52.267
<i>in the dognapping of Lamont,</i>

46:52.351 --> 46:54.645
<i>the governor's wife's prize Lhasa Apso.</i>

46:55.020 --> 46:58.148
<i>However, authorities</i>
<i>are working... rabidly...</i>

46:58.232 --> 47:00.192
<i>to get a leg up on the situation.</i>

47:00.609 --> 47:03.654
<i>Although there's been</i>
<i>an unusually tight leash</i>

47:03.737 --> 47:05.781
<i>on information coming out of Hill Street,</i>

47:05.864 --> 47:07.741

47:21.463 --> 47:22.464

47:22.965 --> 47:26.093
<i>-Anyone with information--</i>
-Whatever happened to serious journalism?

47:26.760 --> 47:30.180
Died years ago, Furillo,
at the hands of a blow dryer.

47:31.139 --> 47:33.600
Please. I've been punished enough.

Thirty thousand dollars for a lapdog?

48:05.757 --> 48:07.467
-Please--
-Mm.

48:08.135 --> 48:09.678
Don't hound me, counselor.

48:10.512 --> 48:11.847
(growls)

48:11.930 --> 48:14.266
You telling me to put a muzzle on it,
Captain?

48:17.311 --> 48:18.395
Why don't we just--

48:19.605 --> 48:20.480
Just let...
