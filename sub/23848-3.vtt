WEBVTT

00:17.200 --> 00:18.480
<i>Previously on Babylon Berlin.</i>

00:18.840 --> 00:23.440
Why is he with the vice squad? Why not
something decent? Murder, corruption...

00:23.520 --> 00:24.800
secret police?

00:24.880 --> 00:27.520
The Lord Mayor of Cologne is being
blackmailed. Dr. Adenauer.

00:27.600 --> 00:28.760
The affair is unsavory.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.920
-I think there is a contracting entity.
-Do you have any leads yet?

00:31.400 --> 00:34.160
-Who is this?
-This one is Mutti from Wedding.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.160
You have nothing to worry about.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.640
No.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.680
What happened?

00:40.760 --> 00:41.760
Can you hear me?

00:42.400 --> 00:43.480
I'll get help.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.320
Please.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.920
<i>Let the train pass.</i>

00:49.160 --> 00:51.760
-According to our regulations...
-It is by order of the <i>Reichswehr </i>.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.480
Someone has to sign off
the freight documents.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.800
That is Major General Seegers.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.120
<i>The train crossed the border</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

01:01.200 --> 01:02.960
It's coming straight to Berlin!

01:07.960 --> 01:09.760
Alexey Kardakov.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.760
Thank you for your help.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.240
CONSIGNMENT NOTE

01:49.040 --> 01:52.080
-Hey, that's my coat!
-Give it to me!

01:55.800 --> 01:57.320
You piece of rat crap!

02:10.720 --> 02:12.880
Police officer!

02:13.280 --> 02:14.560
Stop! This is the police!

02:18.120 --> 02:19.080
Don't move!

02:20.800 --> 02:23.040
Stop immediately! Stop!

02:40.520 --> 02:45.000
ANHALTER FREIGHT YARD
KREUZBERG, BERLIN

03:09.640 --> 03:10.800
Hit the road.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.640
Good luck. Your train leaves Zoo Station
in two hours.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.280
No contact. With nobody.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.400
In two nights, you're back in Moscow.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.920
Death to the traitors of the Revolution!

06:08.880 --> 06:09.960
Everything alright? Where is Kardakov?

06:11.640 --> 06:13.600
The secret service is after him.

06:13.960 --> 06:16.880
-What? Since when?
-We don't know.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.760
But it was too risky.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.160
Hello there.

06:24.000 --> 06:24.880
Hello.

06:25.080 --> 06:29.280
Is this the 10:14 from Leningrad?
I'd like to see the documents, please.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.840
One wagon needs
to be put on another track.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.720
For the onward journey.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.200
Which wagon is it?

06:40.440 --> 06:41.440
The last one.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.720
Paris, yes?

06:47.160 --> 06:49.480
Departs at 3:30 p.m., platform 23.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.600
Paris?

06:52.920 --> 06:55.600
-Why Paris?
-The plan was changed.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.080
Why Paris? The wagon needs
to go to Istanbul. To Trotsky!

06:59.440 --> 07:02.120
Be quiet! Don't ever mention his name.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.840
Is there a problem?

07:07.200 --> 07:08.320
No! What are you...

07:09.520 --> 07:10.720
Give me the documents.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.440
Paris? What is this?
Why Paris all of a sudden?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.360
Give me that right now!

07:18.120 --> 07:21.520
I want to talk to Kardakov, no one else.
He should be here. Not you.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.360
Give me back the documents!

07:26.600 --> 07:27.440
Now.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.960
I'll kill you.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.880
No!

07:43.560 --> 07:44.480
No!

07:45.160 --> 07:48.440
Stop him! Arrest him!

07:48.760 --> 07:51.000
Calm down, you termagant!

07:54.280 --> 07:55.120
Let me go!

07:58.000 --> 08:00.320
-Who is your superior?
-He'll come see you.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.560
-You stink.
-I was a bit unlucky.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.600
It's not broken, you were lucky.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.080
Where can I find Mutti?

09:47.800 --> 09:50.360
Mutti doesn't want
to walk the streets anymore.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.440
She only works from home now.

09:53.720 --> 09:57.200
It's a fiver. I get two now
and you'll give me three later.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.200
Second stairs on the left.

10:07.200 --> 10:11.880
You got a quarter of an hour.
Then you're down here or I'll come up.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.600
You're just hanging around here, I've had
enough, get it? I've had it. Up to here.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.000
Is your mom in there?

10:32.000 --> 10:32.880
Excuse me?

10:43.200 --> 10:45.920
Out, and take your sister too.
And you too.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.600
Get lost, Eckelt.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.400
Take your coat off and sit there.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.240
I said leave it open!

11:06.200 --> 11:07.800
Roll up your sleeves now.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.600
Go on. Make a fist.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.800
What now?

11:26.280 --> 11:29.360
Why do you come see Mutti
if you don't want the speciality?

11:34.080 --> 11:35.240
Get out.

11:35.800 --> 11:36.720
One moment.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.320
So, who is this?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.240
How would I know?

11:46.240 --> 11:48.280
Do you think I remember
the mugs of all those perverts?

11:50.400 --> 11:51.640
Who's the other woman?

11:51.720 --> 11:53.360
Martha Konopatzki.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.480
But there's no point asking for her,
she went back to Pomerania.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.600
Where was this picture taken?

11:58.680 --> 12:00.720
I don't know. Somewhere in the west.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.480
-Address?
-I don't have it.

12:03.560 --> 12:04.560
But you were there.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.120
We were taken there at night.

12:07.200 --> 12:11.320
With hats on our heads which they pulled
down so much we couldn't see nothing.

12:11.640 --> 12:12.480
Who did that?

12:12.760 --> 12:15.600
This guy, that guy.
I can't tell you that, either.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.640
What else do you remember?

12:22.200 --> 12:23.040
Naught.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.000
Alright, the red nag.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.840
It was hanging on the wall staring at us.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.080
There, you see?

12:53.440 --> 12:54.440
How are you?

12:55.760 --> 12:56.920
Have a nice day.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.200
Morning, Jänicke. Everything alright?

13:08.360 --> 13:09.600
Let me go through.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.920
-Hello.
-Hello.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.680
-Oh, it's the big cast today.
-Comrades, men.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.280
The president of the police.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.520
Hello, August.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.960
Yes, alright. Alright!

13:40.040 --> 13:41.720
That's enough. At ease.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.200
You all know what this is about.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.240
There is lots of trouble
awaiting us on May first.

13:49.960 --> 13:53.480
More than a dozen
Communist associations have announced

13:54.040 --> 13:57.200
that they will go against the ban
on demonstrations.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.440
This could lead to a chain reaction.

14:01.720 --> 14:04.880
We have to be determined to stop it.

14:06.600 --> 14:10.160
Radical forces from all directions
have been trying for years

14:10.240 --> 14:14.080
to undermine our state
and bring chaos to our streets.

14:14.160 --> 14:17.400
But we must protect
the citizens of our country

14:17.480 --> 14:21.760
and our democratic constitution!

14:27.720 --> 14:30.040
Therefore, first of all...

14:30.760 --> 14:33.640
Our present crews are backed up

14:33.720 --> 14:37.360
with forces from Spandau and Zehlendorf.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.200
These will be deployed in Kreuzberg,

14:41.280 --> 14:44.080
Neukölln, and in Wedding.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.880
That's where all the rascals live.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.240
-Operation leaders are Reiser,
<i>-Present.</i>

14:51.600 --> 14:55.320
<i>Blaschewski, Boglau and Wolter.</i>

14:56.360 --> 14:59.000
<i>You'll get your equipment</i>
<i>from the armory.</i>

15:06.760 --> 15:07.960
-Hi, Erwin.
-Mr. Wolter.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.960
Mauser 98, 100 pieces of ammunition.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.160
Next.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.200
Hey, Willi, 100 bullets?

15:16.600 --> 15:17.880
That's like in the war!

15:20.720 --> 15:21.720
Would you prefer this one?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.480
MP28, brand new.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.880
Of course I prefer this one.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.360
The General is in town.

15:32.760 --> 15:33.640
Wants to talk to you. No.

15:51.760 --> 15:54.280
-Hello, Inspector Rath.
-I need an enlargement.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.080
A very... large enlargement.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.640
-Is that possible?
-Yes.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.360
Of what exactly?

16:21.760 --> 16:23.800
-Oh, here you are.
-Doris.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.200
-I just wanted to say bye.
-Will you relieve me?

16:29.200 --> 16:30.360
What is it?

16:31.800 --> 16:35.120
Compare cases, systemize them,
they call it a catchword register.

16:35.200 --> 16:39.160
Wow, you've hit a gold mine.
That's worth weeks of work.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.360
But I can't do it.

16:44.040 --> 16:47.280
All day long in the basement,
you wither like a primrose.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.760
I don't mind.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.640
You do it for me then.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.640
I'll give you 70 Pfennig an hour.

16:57.560 --> 16:58.480
Ninety.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.120
Eighty. Last offer, or I'll do it myself.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.200
Deal. Very well, Mrs. Ritter.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.760
Have you heard of the French disease?

17:18.400 --> 17:21.160
-Pardon?
-It's a bacterial infection. Transmitted through mucosal contact.
Also called Great Imitator.

17:24.120 --> 17:25.680
You mean the rash?

17:25.880 --> 17:28.920
It has nothing to do with that.
I'll prescribe an ointment for that.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.080
So what's wrong with me?

17:34.440 --> 17:38.240
Syphilis.
You must have heard of that, right?

17:44.600 --> 17:47.800
-Do you have changing sexual partners?
-I beg your pardon?

17:48.280 --> 17:49.360
At my age?

17:49.560 --> 17:52.280
-Did you have changing sexual partners?
-No, I didn't.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.840
I've only ever had one in my life.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.840
Maybe it was the beasts.

17:58.920 --> 18:02.680
I worked the slaughterhouse for 30 years.
Now they don't want me because of this...

18:02.760 --> 18:06.200
It's only transmitted from human to human.
Affairs?

18:06.400 --> 18:07.840
Are you kidding?

18:08.160 --> 18:11.200
The Department of Health
demands that all cases be documented.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.360
The state wants to know
what its citizens are up to.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.600
So, any love affairs? Could have been a while ago.

18:20.640 --> 18:21.560
One.

18:25.760 --> 18:26.640
One is enough.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.080
Name? He's dead.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.440
<i>Will it go away?</i>

18:37.400 --> 18:38.240
<i>No.</i>

18:39.760 --> 18:41.800
You should go see a doctor, Mrs. Ritter.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.160
You should shut your face,
Mrs. Cziczewicz.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.400
<i>That one time?</i>

18:51.200 --> 18:53.920
<i>It was over 20 years ago,</i>
<i>it can't be possible.</i>

18:54.840 --> 18:57.160
<i>This disease</i>
<i>has a very long incubation period.</i>

18:57.880 --> 18:59.280
<i>Twenty years, you say?</i>

19:01.600 --> 19:02.440
There she is.

19:07.040 --> 19:07.960
What's wrong?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.000
Mum went to the doctor.

19:11.880 --> 19:12.760
And?

19:13.600 --> 19:15.040
Bad weeds grow tall.

19:15.520 --> 19:16.520
Don't say that.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.480
A rash, nothing else.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.400
You have to get some ointment for me.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.040
-What did he say exactly?
-Who?

19:24.320 --> 19:25.240
The doctor.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.240
I went to see Völcker.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.840
That I have reddened skin, she said.
Due to the germs.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.000
I don't know, nothing special.
And now enough of that.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.480
But you won't get better
in that damp slaughterhouse.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.720
That's why they didn't want me anymore.

19:43.720 --> 19:46.760
-I could go to the slaughterhouse.
-No way.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.400
He should rather go find work.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.320
But no broad's work at the slaughterhouse.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.400
He couldn't get any maggots out
with these paws.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.760
Why doesn't the girl go
if I can't find anything?

19:57.920 --> 20:00.880
Are you all right in the head?
Toni goes to school.

20:03.440 --> 20:04.920
That's what we go to work for.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.360
Calm down. I'm still here. I'll be fine.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.760
Look at the tramp.
Always a tenner in her pocket.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.840
-Wonder where she gets them from.
-What did you say?

20:19.880 --> 20:22.000
-Come on, say it again!
-Lotte!

20:22.080 --> 20:23.560
-Calm down.
-You're on the game

20:23.640 --> 20:24.880
but go all sensitive on me?

20:28.480 --> 20:30.360
-Go earn some money...
-Stop!

20:30.440 --> 20:33.200
-...or keep your filthy gob shut!
-Are you nuts?

20:34.440 --> 20:35.600
That's enough!

20:36.040 --> 20:37.280
I'll kill you!

20:41.240 --> 20:42.760
-Bastard!
-Leave her alone.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.320
Stop it!

20:46.240 --> 20:47.080
Look.

20:58.680 --> 20:59.680
Bloody broads!

21:02.200 --> 21:04.040
-Am I the only one...
-Nuts or what?

21:04.120 --> 21:05.720
...who has any common sense?

21:06.040 --> 21:09.480
-Your husband is a rogue.
-So? That's why I only have one.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.480
Over there, Café Josty.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.400
You'll wait for me in the car.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.080
Caretaker! I'm sorry.

22:05.160 --> 22:08.000
-I forgot my key.
-Kardakov, you gave me a fright.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.360
-Come on in then.
-Thank you.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.560
Sveta?

22:41.560 --> 22:42.560
Svetlana?

23:12.960 --> 23:17.280
A planned thing... Assassination...

23:19.920 --> 23:21.280
National affair...

23:25.240 --> 23:27.920
Foreign Minister Stresemann...

23:55.160 --> 23:57.080
Right, Jänicke. Drive me home now.

24:45.920 --> 24:46.880
Emmi.

25:01.120 --> 25:01.960
Emmi.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.920
-Bruno, I...
-Don't worry. It's OK.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.120
You rest.

25:25.720 --> 25:26.880
I'll take care of it.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.880
Lotte. Lotte!

25:50.080 --> 25:51.760
I used to sit by your bed.

25:53.320 --> 25:54.200
So?

25:55.760 --> 25:57.240
You were different then.

25:58.200 --> 25:59.400
Is that all?

26:01.160 --> 26:03.240
We used to treat each other differently.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.120
Yeah, that was before Erich.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.440
I didn't choose him.

26:07.520 --> 26:11.040
You didn't have to marry the creep because
of the brat and get knocked up again.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.960
You can talk. You've just been lucky so far.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.000
I took care, Ilse.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.200
Look at yourself.

26:20.560 --> 26:23.120
You're sitting in a dump,
you've locked yourself in.

26:25.280 --> 26:28.160
What a smug bitch you've become.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.480
He's going into the restaurant.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.280
Stay calm.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.760
-I... to Kardakov.
-Get out!

27:51.840 --> 27:55.360
-He's my friend.
-Get out right now! I'll call the police.

27:55.440 --> 27:59.280
Wait! No, don't do that. Alexey Ivanovich!

28:02.200 --> 28:04.960
Help! Help!

28:11.520 --> 28:13.960
-Thank you.
-Already full?

28:14.840 --> 28:17.360
I can't eat any more.
It was really very good.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.480
My Emmi has always been a great chef.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.360
I have relatives in Cologne.

28:24.440 --> 28:27.720
-You do?
-My cousin married an innkeeper.

28:28.400 --> 28:31.560
Of a famous inn. Der Bier-Esel.

28:32.360 --> 28:33.760
Oh, really? Thank you.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.240
Mussels and beer.
My father used to be a regular there.

28:37.560 --> 28:40.640
His old man will be
Cologne's next Chief of Police.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.120
If all goes well.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.760
Are you going steady?

28:47.840 --> 28:50.560
-Pardon?
-Married?

28:51.600 --> 28:52.600
No.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
Leave him alone, Emmi.
He's had a tough day.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.280
Bruno never tells me about his work.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.200
It's better that way, Emmi dear.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.160
Believe me.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.680
Please excuse me. I'm going to bed.

29:17.560 --> 29:18.960
Again, thank you very much.

29:19.680 --> 29:20.560
You're welcome.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.040
-Good night.
-Good night.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.520
-Sleep well.
-Yes.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.160
Right, my friend.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.280
Let's do some straight talking.

29:41.760 --> 29:44.040
Why did Benda want to talk to you alone?

29:44.480 --> 29:46.560
-What do you mean?
-Come on.

29:46.640 --> 29:49.600
I've been in this business long enough.
Don't beat around the bush.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.440
What do you want, Bruno?

29:52.520 --> 29:55.320
I don't want to be the fool in the dark.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.480
I won't tell you. Alright.

30:04.880 --> 30:08.400
But I will tell you that tomorrow
you have the honor of accompanying me.

30:08.760 --> 30:09.600
Where to?

30:17.200 --> 30:18.160
Kreuzberg.

30:18.240 --> 30:21.920
First of May. The Reds want to demonstrate
and we'll stop them.

30:22.880 --> 30:24.440
Yes. Special operation.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.040
Comb houses, search flats for weapons.

30:27.640 --> 30:30.920
Pure harassment. The real dirty work.

30:31.800 --> 30:35.520
-Maybe have a shot after all?
-No, thanks. Doesn't go with that.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.400
With what?

30:37.960 --> 30:39.280
With stupid questions.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.920
I'd like to know what you're about.

30:54.560 --> 30:58.480
<i>Dear Helga, thank you for your letter</i>
<i>which I received yesterday.</i>

30:59.480 --> 31:02.360
<i>It is good to know</i>
<i>that everything is alright at home.</i>

31:03.000 --> 31:05.080
<i>Here, it's not that simple.</i>

31:06.400 --> 31:08.120
<i>I don't want to alarm you...</i>

31:09.120 --> 31:12.240
<i>but I still can't tell you for sure</i>
<i>when I'll come home.</i>

31:14.560 --> 31:17.280
<i>Unforeseen incidences have stopped me</i>

31:17.360 --> 31:20.480
<i>from speedily fulfilling my tasks</i>
<i>for the foreseeable future.</i>

31:23.120 --> 31:25.560
<i>If I look</i>
<i>at the hustle and bustle around me,</i>

31:26.000 --> 31:30.920
<i>I think of our dreams, and I feel</i>
<i>a kind of hope I hadn't known before.</i>

31:31.680 --> 31:34.600
<i>The hope that</i>
<i>we will find a way out of this secrecy...</i>

31:35.920 --> 31:37.760
<i>out of this secretiveness.</i>

31:37.840 --> 31:40.320
Well? Dance some more tonight?

31:41.800 --> 31:42.960
Not tonight.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.160
Maybe tomorrow, who knows.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.680
<i>Maybe even here in Berlin.</i> <i>Please think about it.</i>

31:53.120 --> 31:54.560
<i>And say hi to the boy from me.</i>

31:56.640 --> 31:58.960
<i>With best regards, yours, Gereon.</i>

32:02.440 --> 32:03.640
Is that Kardakov?

32:05.240 --> 32:06.080
No.

32:11.640 --> 32:12.800
BERLIN DIRECTORY 1929

32:36.480 --> 32:38.760
He's still here. In your room.

33:20.000 --> 33:20.920
Is that you?

33:21.640 --> 33:23.800
What is this, Alexey? Where have you been?

33:25.000 --> 33:25.840
What are you doing here?

33:52.120 --> 33:53.240
What the hell is going on?

33:56.000 --> 33:57.160
Go on, let's get him.

33:58.520 --> 33:59.720
Drive!

34:01.960 --> 34:03.520
Turn the car around!

34:06.840 --> 34:08.920
Leave me alone! What do you want?

34:12.320 --> 34:13.360
Get in!

34:16.560 --> 34:18.360
-Let me go!
-That's enough!

34:22.280 --> 34:23.680
Help me, help me!

34:24.600 --> 34:26.840
Help! Help me!

34:26.920 --> 34:28.000
Help me!

34:28.680 --> 34:30.240
You have to help me, please!

34:32.800 --> 34:34.200
Help me!

34:50.280 --> 34:51.440
Do you want one too?

34:52.200 --> 34:53.040
Yes.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.480
-Have you seen the man before?
-I don't know.

34:59.440 --> 35:02.400
He may have been one of them
when they were meeting here.

35:03.200 --> 35:04.040
Excuse me.

35:05.400 --> 35:06.360
Who?

35:07.360 --> 35:08.440
The Russians.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.440
Sometimes there were quite a lot of them.

35:14.120 --> 35:16.120
Then it got noisy.

35:17.960 --> 35:20.480
Politics. In your room.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.000
Who was in there before me?

35:24.080 --> 35:25.920
Kardakov was his name.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.920
He was a violinist, actually.

35:31.680 --> 35:34.000
But when he really got talking...

35:41.640 --> 35:43.520
<i>I didn't understand a word,</i>

35:44.000 --> 35:46.440
<i>but if he had said, jump!</i>

35:47.440 --> 35:48.760
<i>I would have jumped.</i>

35:49.640 --> 35:50.480
<i>He had something...</i>

35:53.480 --> 35:55.200
Sometimes it was uncanny.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.680
-The suitcase in my room?
-Yes, that's his.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.920
Sorry, he meant to pick it up yesterday.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.360
I'll take it to the basement tomorrow,
and that one too.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.080
Where did Kardakov go?

36:09.640 --> 36:12.880
On tour, for six months.
With a whole orchestra.

36:12.960 --> 36:17.320
On a cruise ship.
All the way to the Bosporus, he said.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.000
Then why did he leave his instrument here?

36:25.200 --> 36:26.800
A mysterious guy. Sometimes he told me...

36:33.160 --> 36:36.240
He was on the other side in the war,
not on ours.

36:37.480 --> 36:38.640
"They fell...

36:39.880 --> 36:42.200
like bees in the freezing cold," he said.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.520
I once dreamt that it was him
who shot my Helmut.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.920
And that the Lord sent him to me.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.160
What a lot of nonsense.

36:59.480 --> 37:00.440
Were you in the war?

37:02.280 --> 37:04.680
I followed my brother to the front.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.360
Then I came back alone.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.480
So you know what it's like.

37:14.680 --> 37:17.640
To wake up in the morning... alone.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.480
To hate the silence, and the birds too.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.080
All that false peace.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.200
My mother couldn't cope.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.800
For her, the wrong son returned home.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.760
I'll take the suitcase down tomorrow,
if you'll allow me.

37:52.800 --> 37:53.760
Good night.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.280
Good night.

38:35.360 --> 38:38.680
<i>...clashes with the Berlin police</i>
<i>have already been reported.</i>

38:38.760 --> 38:43.520
<i>At this hour, KPD activists are handing</i>
<i>out flyers in Wedding and Kreuzberg.</i>

38:43.600 --> 38:47.280
<i>These say that the ban on demonstrations</i>
<i>was lifted.</i>

38:47.360 --> 38:49.840
<i>This is not true.</i>

38:49.920 --> 38:52.920
<i>Tomorrow, on May First,</i>
<i>demonstrations are still banned.</i>

38:53.000 --> 38:56.080
-Can't you sleep?
-How, with this racket?

38:56.160 --> 38:59.480
<i>...likely that violence will escalate,</i>
<i>emphasized Chief of Police...</i>

39:00.480 --> 39:01.840
I'm sorry.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.120
-Was the radio on?
-Yes!

39:04.360 --> 39:09.480
-What was on?
-I don't know, something political.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.640
Oh please, let's listen to it.

39:16.560 --> 39:20.160
Do you have any idea how late it is?
I have to be up early!

39:21.400 --> 39:25.480
Come on, I'll make you a sandwich
and we'll listen to it together.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.040
You translate.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.440
Like in the old days!

39:36.840 --> 39:41.720
<i>...emerge stronger from the election</i>
<i>campaign so that they keep working</i>

39:41.800 --> 39:43.560
<i>for the best of our fatherland.</i>

39:44.440 --> 39:48.560
<i>Now you will hear</i>
<i>Gustav Mahler's </i>Rückert Lieder

39:48.640 --> 39:51.120
<i>and </i>I Am Lost To The World.

40:02.560 --> 40:05.400
-Music.
-With singing?

40:06.840 --> 40:08.200
Well then.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.680
A woman is singing...

40:12.760 --> 40:16.840
<i>I am lost</i>

40:16.920 --> 40:22.000
<i>To the world</i>

40:28.360 --> 40:34.160
<i>With which I had spoiled</i>

40:34.240 --> 40:37.080
<i>A lot of time</i>

40:40.560 --> 40:44.200
<i>For a long time</i>

40:44.280 --> 40:49.560
<i>It hasn't heard from me</i>

41:14.360 --> 41:19.520
<i>It may well think</i>

41:19.920 --> 41:26.880
<i>That I have died</i> <i>And it doesn't matter to me</i>

41:59.960 --> 42:02.880
Alright now, nice and easy.

42:04.560 --> 42:06.640
Tell us what your plan was.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.080
I don't know what you mean.

42:10.600 --> 42:14.680
Your plan? The Red Fortress.
Your Fourth International.

42:14.760 --> 42:18.960
-What were you up to?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

42:21.200 --> 42:24.720
I really don't know. I'm a railway worker.

42:30.080 --> 42:33.800
There is no point in lying.
We know who you are.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.800
What did you want at Kardakov's place?

42:36.880 --> 42:40.240
What is the Red Fortress planning to do?

42:42.400 --> 42:47.000
What's in Istanbul? What's your plan?

42:47.840 --> 42:50.240
Talk. Talk!

42:52.080 --> 42:53.200
Why Istanbul?

42:55.000 --> 42:58.720
Trotsky is there. That much I know.
But I don't know anything else.

42:59.720 --> 43:02.720
I was just supposed to meet Kardakov
at the train. Honestly!

43:03.200 --> 43:04.920
Kardakov is dead.

43:07.400 --> 43:10.080
But he was friendly enough
to leave us this.

43:13.600 --> 43:15.480
The Red Fortress...

43:16.080 --> 43:18.480
sends a train to Trotsky,

43:19.080 --> 43:22.080
to Istanbul.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.720
Tell us why.
Why are you sending him a train?

43:27.080 --> 43:29.200
Why to Istanbul? Talk!

43:31.400 --> 43:34.840
What's on that train?
What's in that wagon? Tell us.

43:42.280 --> 43:43.400
What?

43:44.120 --> 43:45.360
A lot of gold.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.320
Gold? What gold?

43:48.040 --> 43:51.240
The Kulaks' gold, stolen from the museums?
What gold, my boy?

43:55.400 --> 43:57.200
It's the Sorokins' gold.

44:01.600 --> 44:03.880
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

44:05.400 --> 44:07.520
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

44:09.040 --> 44:10.920
<i>But not yet now</i>

44:13.360 --> 44:16.320
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i>

44:23.520 --> 44:26.160
<i>Ocean of time</i>

44:27.440 --> 44:29.360
<i>Eternal law</i>

44:31.040 --> 44:33.080
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

44:34.680 --> 44:36.000
<i>To ashes</i>

44:36.640 --> 44:38.320
<i>But not yet now</i>

44:59.520 --> 45:02.680
<i>It must be just a dream</i>

45:03.040 --> 45:07.760
<i>Trying to snatch the wind</i>

45:07.840 --> 45:11.480
<i>Who really knows?</i>

45:14.280 --> 45:17.320
<i>The clock on your wall</i>

45:17.800 --> 45:20.880
<i>It is filled with sand</i>

45:21.320 --> 45:24.760
<i>Put your hand in mine</i>

45:25.120 --> 45:28.320
<i>And let us be forever</i>

45:28.840 --> 45:32.160
<i>Now you make your choice</i>

45:32.520 --> 45:37.120
<i>And throw us</i>
<i>in between happiness and agony</i>

45:37.200 --> 45:42.120
<i>But I can forgive you</i>

45:43.720 --> 45:46.600
<i>You are very close to death</i>

45:47.080 --> 45:49.880
<i>But your eye still clear</i>

45:49.960 --> 45:53.520
<i>Does it recognize me? I'm ready</i>

45:53.600 --> 45:58.040
<i>To seek immortality with you</i>
