00:10.861 --> 00:14.326
Then the house spit out this entity.

00:14.966 --> 00:16.999
There was a silhouette, just all black,

00:17.001 --> 00:19.869
- standing in the doorway.
- Ow.

00:19.871 --> 00:23.539
Her face had been bludgeoned
till she was unrecognizable.

00:23.541 --> 00:27.643
This thing does not
[bleep] like this person.

00:27.645 --> 00:30.246
I need to know that my family is safe.

00:30.248 --> 00:33.382
This person's in trouble.

00:33.384 --> 00:37.754
It's saying, "I'm gonna make you pay."

00:37.756 --> 00:40.423
Something bad's going to happen.

00:40.425 --> 00:43.326
My name is Amy Allan.

00:43.328 --> 00:44.694
There's panic.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.129
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:46.131 --> 00:47.196
I see dead people.

00:47.198 --> 00:49.332
They all died horribly.

00:49.334 --> 00:51.033
I speak to dead people.

00:51.035 --> 00:52.435
Get out of here.

00:52.437 --> 00:54.070
And they speak to me.

00:54.072 --> 00:56.105
Vicious.

00:56.107 --> 00:59.242
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:59.244 --> 01:00.943
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

01:00.945 --> 01:02.512
I rely on my partner.

01:02.514 --> 01:04.147
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:04.149 --> 01:06.048
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:06.050 --> 01:07.750
This guy's a real piece of work.

01:07.752 --> 01:11.420
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:11.422 --> 01:12.922
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

01:12.924 --> 01:14.090
It's my job to reveal them.

01:14.092 --> 01:16.359
This is not good.

01:16.361 --> 01:18.094
But Steve and I never speak...

01:18.096 --> 01:20.129
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:20.131 --> 01:21.898
Until the very end...

01:21.900 --> 01:23.366
I want my life back.

01:23.368 --> 01:25.568
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:25.570 --> 01:27.370
Is he trying to kill her?

01:27.372 --> 01:28.638
Or time to get out.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.139
Oh, my God.

01:30.141 --> 01:31.641
This is going to kill us.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

01:45.240 --> 01:49.242
I'm in Delaware, Ohio,
about 35 minutes north of Columbus.

01:49.244 --> 01:51.611
I got a call from a newlywed mother of two

01:51.613 --> 01:53.996
who just moved into her new husband's home.

01:53.998 --> 01:55.965
You would think this would be
the happiest time of her life,

01:55.967 --> 01:58.301
but she says she's in a living hell.

01:58.303 --> 02:00.319
She's convinced the house is haunted

02:00.321 --> 02:03.072
and that her and her two
kids are in serious danger.

02:03.074 --> 02:05.308
She practically begged me
and Amy to come out here,

02:05.310 --> 02:07.176
and I'm hoping we can help her out.

02:11.182 --> 02:12.515
Before Amy arrives,

02:12.517 --> 02:16.118
I clear the house of
any leading information.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.687
Once family photos,

02:17.689 --> 02:21.157
religious and personal items
are covered or removed,

02:21.159 --> 02:23.492
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:32.136 --> 02:36.339
I'm having problems with this lady

02:36.341 --> 02:41.844
'cause she feels like it's
hell for her to be here.

02:41.846 --> 02:44.814
But I think she had money and nice things,

02:44.816 --> 02:48.584
but her husband made
them move here to farm,

02:48.586 --> 02:50.887
and things did not go well.

02:50.889 --> 02:54.323
She thought that the land was bad.

02:54.325 --> 02:59.245
Then, she says she is gonna give
him a taste of his own medicine.

03:08.506 --> 03:10.206
Amy, you sounded
really bad on the phone

03:10.208 --> 03:12.008
as far as the activity here.

03:12.010 --> 03:13.409
What's happening?

03:13.411 --> 03:15.811
Well, I moved here about four months ago,

03:15.813 --> 03:19.048
with my two children, after I got married.

03:19.050 --> 03:21.751
And it's escalated to the
point where it's pure hell

03:21.753 --> 03:23.336
living here.

03:23.338 --> 03:28.391
It's just not what I expected
from being newly married.

03:28.393 --> 03:29.725
Did you guys buy this place together?

03:29.727 --> 03:30.993
- What happened?
- We did not.

03:30.995 --> 03:33.095
Phil actually purchased this house,
um, a few months

03:33.097 --> 03:35.564
before we met a couple years ago.

03:35.566 --> 03:38.217
Okay. So, who exactly lives in the house?

03:38.219 --> 03:39.885
I have a picture here.

03:39.887 --> 03:43.606
Um, this is my husband, Phil, and myself.

03:43.608 --> 03:45.508
There is my older child, Jerrick.

03:45.510 --> 03:46.943
He's 15.

03:46.945 --> 03:50.663
My younger child, Matthias,
who is on the autism spectrum,

03:50.665 --> 03:52.214
he is 10. So, Amy,

03:52.216 --> 03:54.250
what kind of things are you
guys experiencing in the house?

03:54.252 --> 03:58.020
We have, um, heard things.

03:58.022 --> 04:01.824
Doors will open and close on their own.

04:01.826 --> 04:05.328
We have seen shadows and apparitions.

04:05.330 --> 04:07.530
And it's even escalated to the point

04:07.532 --> 04:09.515
where people have been touched.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.534
I need to know that my family is safe,

04:11.536 --> 04:14.320
and I'm not sure that's the case right now.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.755
Is everybody in the house

04:15.757 --> 04:18.057
having the same amount of experiences?

04:18.059 --> 04:21.744
I personally feel like I
have a lot of experiences.

04:21.745 --> 04:23.145
My older son, Jerrick,

04:23.147 --> 04:27.350
has had quite a bit of the
bulk of experiences, as well.

04:27.352 --> 04:29.402
Okay. How's he handling all this?

04:29.404 --> 04:30.553
Not very well.

04:30.555 --> 04:32.571
He's... He's incredibly frustrated.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.241
Um, at times, he gets angry.

04:35.243 --> 04:36.442
Wants it to stop,

04:36.444 --> 04:38.728
and, quite frankly, if it doesn't stop,

04:38.730 --> 04:41.314
- he doesn't want to live here.
- Really?

04:41.316 --> 04:42.698
I have, at times,

04:42.700 --> 04:47.053
shouted at whatever this
is in a very loud voice.

04:47.055 --> 04:49.839
I've just told it that my God
is a lot stronger than you.

04:49.841 --> 04:51.841
Did it stop for a little bit?

04:51.843 --> 04:53.793
I think I made it more angry.

04:53.795 --> 04:55.761
I feel like it's evil

04:55.763 --> 04:59.081
and definitely does not
want me and my kids here.

05:01.552 --> 05:05.654
This woman is complaining
about her mother-in-law.

05:05.656 --> 05:13.062
So, this older woman,
she hates the daughter-in-law.

05:13.064 --> 05:14.797
She didn't take care of her family.

05:14.799 --> 05:17.433
She didn't take pride in the family.

05:17.435 --> 05:22.438
What I'm seeing, um,
in these rooms and stuff... mm...

05:22.440 --> 05:24.440
doesn't look like this place.

05:24.442 --> 05:28.778
- Okay.
- Um, she's freaking out now.

05:28.780 --> 05:30.379
It's like she's all hyper now.

05:30.381 --> 05:32.248
It's making me anxious.

05:32.250 --> 05:33.349
Oh!

05:33.351 --> 05:36.419
I saw her looking like a corpse.

05:42.960 --> 05:46.595
This is a really,
really creepy place down here.

05:46.597 --> 05:47.763
I don't like to come down here.

05:47.765 --> 05:49.698
- Neither does anyone else.
- Okay.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.450
So, why are you creeped out by it?

05:51.452 --> 05:53.869
You constantly feel like
you're being watched.

05:53.871 --> 05:55.254
So, right now, you have that feeling?

05:55.256 --> 05:58.891
- Yes.
- Anything else?

05:58.893 --> 06:01.093
Well, the... the most terrifying experience

06:01.095 --> 06:06.732
was when I was pushed down
the stairs quite forcefully.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.318
Okay. So, how hard did you get pushed?

06:09.320 --> 06:10.986
Pretty hard, because, I mean, it sent me...

06:10.988 --> 06:12.288
Here. Just hit me.

06:12.290 --> 06:13.372
No, no. Just hit my chest.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.707
Show me. Like that.

06:14.709 --> 06:16.075
With both hands, or was it just one?

06:16.077 --> 06:17.610
Yeah. I mean, it was forceful enough

06:17.612 --> 06:20.062
to send me flying down into the wall.

06:20.064 --> 06:21.530
- I'm scared now...
- Yeah.

06:21.532 --> 06:23.499
'Cause I don't know if
it's gonna happen again.

06:26.871 --> 06:30.039
There are two people running down there,

06:30.041 --> 06:32.341
and they're yelling, and they're scared.

06:33.044 --> 06:37.346
Yeah, they're all...
bunch of people cowering in the corner.

06:41.319 --> 06:43.085
How many?

06:43.087 --> 06:44.520
10 to 15.

06:44.522 --> 06:48.991
They're all balled up,
hunched down, and like that.

06:48.993 --> 06:54.280
I think that people would
feel uncomfortable here.

06:54.282 --> 06:58.801
They would feel, uh, fear, uh,

06:58.803 --> 07:00.669
but it's from these people.

07:09.814 --> 07:11.747
Okay. So, what's going on in here?

07:11.749 --> 07:18.037
I have seen a shadow figure
standing right beside of my bed,

07:18.039 --> 07:19.421
looking down at me.

07:19.423 --> 07:20.506
He was tall.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.791
I'm gonna guess close to 6'.

07:22.793 --> 07:24.577
Couldn't give you distinct facial features

07:24.579 --> 07:26.879
other than he was very thin.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.297
Was it dark in the room?

07:28.299 --> 07:31.851
There was just enough light that...
that you could see.

07:31.853 --> 07:33.435
Did you sleep the rest of the night?

07:33.437 --> 07:34.937
Off and on.

07:34.939 --> 07:38.307
I didn't sleep very well,
and I haven't really ever since.

07:40.545 --> 07:44.246
What the [bleep]

07:44.248 --> 07:46.248
I don't like it up here.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.884
I don't feel good up here.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.520
Something runs around...

07:51.522 --> 07:55.958
something dark, fast.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.994
Something's dripping off of it.

07:58.996 --> 08:01.363
- Can people see it, too?
- Oh, yeah.

08:01.365 --> 08:05.267
This is the thing that
they're encountering big-time.

08:05.269 --> 08:06.635
They can't sleep.

08:06.637 --> 08:10.306
They're having, like,
apparently out-of-body experiences.

08:11.876 --> 08:16.912
It's making me nervous and panicky,

08:16.914 --> 08:20.816
and it touches people.

08:20.818 --> 08:23.419
They, uh... They can feel it.

08:23.421 --> 08:25.404
It gives you, like, the chills.

08:27.925 --> 08:31.727
Now, has anything else
happened to you up here?

08:31.729 --> 08:35.164
Yes. In my office next door,

08:35.166 --> 08:37.600
- I was typing at my computer.
- Okay.

08:37.602 --> 08:41.370
And the next minute,
I was on the floor screaming,

08:41.371 --> 08:45.774
and my son had called
911 because I had fallen.

08:45.776 --> 08:50.079
The chair landed on top of me,
and I was unconscious briefly.

08:50.081 --> 08:51.547
What the hell happened?

08:51.549 --> 08:55.317
It's almost as if my chair was
flipped over with me in it,

08:55.319 --> 08:58.354
is... is kind of how it looked and felt.

08:58.356 --> 09:00.606
Have you ever experienced
fainting spells in the past?

09:00.608 --> 09:01.690
Yes.

09:01.692 --> 09:03.609
But you don't think this is that?

09:03.611 --> 09:05.177
You think it's paranormal?

09:05.179 --> 09:08.063
I do think it's paranormal.

09:08.065 --> 09:09.064
I had no warning.

09:09.066 --> 09:11.183
I didn't feel weird that day.

09:11.185 --> 09:14.603
Everything was fine,
and it was with enough force

09:14.605 --> 09:18.440
that I landed across the room
with my head into the wall.

09:18.442 --> 09:19.858
I don't know that I'm so convinced

09:19.860 --> 09:22.611
that that's paranormal,
but I think we'll figure it out.

09:22.613 --> 09:24.213
Okay.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.848
Have you thought about leaving?

09:25.850 --> 09:27.950
If they're in danger... I mean,

09:27.952 --> 09:29.618
I would move tonight if...

09:29.620 --> 09:31.954
if I thought my kids were not safe.

09:35.860 --> 09:40.863
This thing is here most
of the time in this room.

09:40.865 --> 09:43.866
This woman with, like, light hair...

09:43.868 --> 09:45.467
Like, is she being grabbed?

09:45.469 --> 09:47.102
She can feel it.

09:47.104 --> 09:52.374
Being grabbed in the
back of the neck, hard.

09:52.376 --> 09:54.076
Like, I feel her neck hurts.

09:54.078 --> 09:57.179
Like, her spine in her neck, you know?

09:57.181 --> 10:02.418
Then, it, like, slams her forward

10:02.420 --> 10:03.485
so she's, like, sitting,

10:03.487 --> 10:05.254
and it just goes...

10:05.256 --> 10:07.156
Like, all of a sudden, she's just like...

10:10.328 --> 10:11.910
Oh, my God.

10:12.596 --> 10:13.929
Ah.

10:35.847 --> 10:37.313
Now, Phil, when I talked to Amy,

10:37.315 --> 10:39.515
she was talking about
how you bought this place

10:39.517 --> 10:40.916
before you guys even met.

10:40.918 --> 10:42.301
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

10:42.303 --> 10:43.919
So, how long were you here
before she actually moved in?

10:43.921 --> 10:45.287
About 21/2 years.

10:45.289 --> 10:47.790
So, did you notice anything
unusual when you first moved in?

10:47.792 --> 10:52.328
Honestly, I never really saw
much in those 21/2 years.

10:52.330 --> 10:56.232
After Amy and the kids moved in, um, I...

10:56.234 --> 10:58.901
it just... Things escalated from there.

10:58.903 --> 11:01.537
- What happened?
- One night, I was sleeping.

11:01.539 --> 11:05.374
And around 3:30 in the morning,
I just was restless.

11:05.376 --> 11:08.244
And I kind of rolled over
and looked over my shoulder,

11:08.246 --> 11:11.564
and in the doorway was a...

11:11.566 --> 11:13.933
like, a silhouette, just all black,

11:13.935 --> 11:15.618
standing in the doorway.

11:15.620 --> 11:18.454
I stared at it for about five seconds.

11:18.456 --> 11:19.521
The eyes were clear.

11:19.523 --> 11:21.290
Everything else was black.

11:21.292 --> 11:22.825
And, after five seconds,

11:22.827 --> 11:24.810
I looked away, looked
back, and it was gone.

11:24.812 --> 11:27.963
- That's when I was convinced.
- Okay.

11:27.965 --> 11:30.499
So, have you experienced anything else?

11:30.501 --> 11:31.934
Doors opening and closing.

11:31.936 --> 11:33.369
I'd be downstairs,

11:33.371 --> 11:36.388
and you would hear one of the
bedroom door's latch click.

11:36.390 --> 11:37.756
And then, it would pause for a second.

11:37.758 --> 11:38.874
Then, you'd hear it closed again.

11:38.876 --> 11:40.743
And you can go up and press the doors,

11:40.745 --> 11:42.544
and they're locked.

11:42.546 --> 11:43.879
So, you've gone up to investigate?

11:43.881 --> 11:45.147
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

11:45.149 --> 11:46.515
Are you sure the kids ain't up there?

11:46.517 --> 11:47.983
Positive.

11:47.985 --> 11:49.351
Amy's gonna do her walk,

11:49.353 --> 11:51.170
and she may say, "Listen,
you need to move from here."

11:51.172 --> 11:52.755
How... How would you feel about that?

11:52.757 --> 11:53.872
- I love the house.
- Right.

11:53.874 --> 11:58.627
But I love my wife and kids a lot more.

11:58.629 --> 12:03.132
This thing causes a lot of anxiety.

12:03.134 --> 12:05.534
It's almost like, if the doors were closed,
this thing would,

12:05.536 --> 12:08.971
like, run back and forth and,
like, slam into the door,

12:08.973 --> 12:10.272
trying to get in.

12:13.110 --> 12:15.060
They hear it.

12:15.062 --> 12:17.529
It, like...

12:17.531 --> 12:21.717
can go into people's bodies a little bit,

12:21.719 --> 12:25.220
and it definitely takes
energy away from people.

12:25.222 --> 12:27.439
And then, it... it makes them do things.

12:27.441 --> 12:28.958
Like what?

12:28.960 --> 12:32.127
Picks people for the
person to get angry at.

12:32.129 --> 12:34.930
So it's not, like, a generalized anger.

12:34.932 --> 12:36.598
It's specific.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.852
Like, it plants very specific thoughts.

12:39.854 --> 12:44.290
Like, "You're gonna get
angry at <i> this</i> person."

12:44.292 --> 12:48.644
Somehow, it's associated with the house.

12:48.646 --> 12:54.516
I see it, like, pulling things
from the past and eating it.

13:02.893 --> 13:03.892
Jerrick, how old are you?

13:03.894 --> 13:06.095
15.

13:06.097 --> 13:07.830
So, I was talking to Mom and Phil.

13:07.832 --> 13:09.465
Seems like things are pretty bad here.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.850
Yeah, our attitudes change a lot.

13:11.852 --> 13:15.604
I'll be just sitting down,
just having a great day.

13:15.606 --> 13:18.240
And then, out of nowhere,
I'll just be angry

13:18.242 --> 13:20.159
and just get angry at
the world for no reason.

13:20.161 --> 13:22.745
And it's just... It's really weird.

13:22.747 --> 13:24.163
Anything else?

13:24.165 --> 13:26.348
I'm a firm believer that
there's three shadow figures

13:26.350 --> 13:28.133
in this house... a taller one,

13:28.135 --> 13:32.388
big, black, probably about
5'10" to, like, 6' tall,

13:32.390 --> 13:34.923
and two shorter ones, more childlike.

13:34.925 --> 13:36.108
Where do you see that?

13:36.110 --> 13:37.693
You'll see it out of the
corner of your eye.

13:37.695 --> 13:39.078
You'll see something,

13:39.080 --> 13:42.731
like, smaller peeking around
the corner of the stairs at you.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.466
I mean, how are you dealing with this?

13:44.468 --> 13:45.868
I don't sleep well.

13:45.870 --> 13:47.970
If something happens,
I'll either ignore it or...

13:47.972 --> 13:49.805
I'm not usually really
quick to challenge it

13:49.807 --> 13:51.223
because I don't like challenging things

13:51.225 --> 13:52.474
that I can't fight back to,

13:52.476 --> 13:54.777
- 'cause I can't see them.
- Anything else?

13:54.779 --> 13:57.379
One time, I was sitting up in my room,
watching TV,

13:57.381 --> 13:58.480
and something came over

13:58.482 --> 13:59.832
and just slammed its hand down on my leg,

13:59.834 --> 14:01.950
with more force than that.

14:01.952 --> 14:03.118
What do you think is here?

14:03.120 --> 14:05.537
I feel that whatever's in this house

14:05.539 --> 14:09.258
doesn't really like people
who are devout Christians.

14:12.229 --> 14:15.697
Whoo!

14:15.699 --> 14:19.034
This thing does not
[bleep] like this person

14:19.036 --> 14:22.271
and, like, is, like, choking them bad.

14:22.273 --> 14:24.807
Like, holy [bleep]

14:24.809 --> 14:28.977
Like, cannot breathe.

14:28.979 --> 14:32.598
This is very focused, which is strange

14:32.600 --> 14:35.317
because this thing doesn't
have one consciousness.

14:35.319 --> 14:38.587
This person is somehow triggering something

14:38.589 --> 14:39.955
in this thing

14:39.957 --> 14:43.725
that's making it want to
kill this [bleep] person.

14:46.263 --> 14:48.530
- So it could?
- Yeah.

14:48.532 --> 14:53.602
I- I don't know how that hasn't happened.

14:53.604 --> 14:55.704
Ooh, it's so bad.

14:55.706 --> 14:57.773
This person's in trouble.

15:14.579 --> 15:16.645
Phil and Amy don't have
a clue about the history

15:16.647 --> 15:18.214
of their property,

15:18.216 --> 15:21.033
so I reached out to
several local historians.

15:21.035 --> 15:23.436
I just got a call back from a genealogist.

15:23.438 --> 15:27.022
He tells me the original owners
of their land ended up broke,

15:27.024 --> 15:28.891
alone, and insane.

15:34.632 --> 15:35.798
Russ, you mentioned on the phone

15:35.800 --> 15:38.501
that the original owners
of my clients' land

15:38.503 --> 15:40.002
had a pretty tough time there

15:40.004 --> 15:41.370
and that they actually went insane.

15:41.372 --> 15:43.389
- Is that right?
- Yes, they did.

15:43.391 --> 15:44.740
There were two gentlemen.

15:44.742 --> 15:47.309
There was a prominent Pittsburgh
judge named Henry Baldwin.

15:47.311 --> 15:49.311
And I have a picture of Baldwin here.

15:49.313 --> 15:52.047
He inherited the property,
about 16,000 acres...

15:52.049 --> 15:53.849
- Okay...
- in about 1807,

15:53.851 --> 15:55.551
but he didn't want to come to Delaware.

15:55.553 --> 15:58.671
So he hired Moses Bixby
to manage the property.

15:58.673 --> 16:01.207
He was a local businessman
in the Delaware area.

16:01.209 --> 16:04.226
A year later,
Henry Baldwin sold Bixby the land.

16:04.228 --> 16:05.428
How does it go for him?

16:05.430 --> 16:08.097
In 1816, his daughter Lucy

16:08.099 --> 16:10.599
dies of unknown causes at the age of 27.

16:10.601 --> 16:13.369
1821, his wife, also named Lucy...

16:13.371 --> 16:16.005
She dies at the age of 61.

16:16.007 --> 16:17.173
Okay.

16:17.175 --> 16:19.241
So Bixby suffered a lot
during his time there.

16:19.243 --> 16:21.811
But you said the two
original owners went insane.

16:21.813 --> 16:24.196
Who went crazy first... Bixby or Baldwin?

16:24.198 --> 16:25.648
Baldwin.

16:25.650 --> 16:27.967
Actually,
he was appointed to Congress in 1822.

16:27.969 --> 16:29.635
Shortly after taking his seat,

16:29.637 --> 16:32.354
he steps down because of mental illness.

16:32.356 --> 16:34.173
He ends up coming back to Delaware,

16:34.175 --> 16:36.258
and he's wanting his property back.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.461
The property that he sold to Bixby?

16:38.463 --> 16:39.462
- Correct, yes.
- All right.

16:39.464 --> 16:40.513
So, what does he do?

16:40.515 --> 16:42.097
He ends up taking Bixby to court.

16:42.099 --> 16:43.933
Bixby does win the case

16:43.935 --> 16:47.586
because Baldwin did sell him the property.

16:47.588 --> 16:51.574
Even though Bixby won the case,
it took a big toll on him.

16:51.576 --> 16:55.344
Later on that year, he is declared insane,

16:55.346 --> 16:58.214
and the state legislature
appoints guardians to keep him.

16:58.216 --> 17:01.784
Here's an article to that effect.

17:01.786 --> 17:04.286
Okay. So now, he's being watched
by these state guardians.

17:04.288 --> 17:06.271
- How does it go?
- It doesn't go well.

17:06.273 --> 17:10.108
Two years later, in 1826,
Bixby escapes the house

17:10.111 --> 17:12.194
and runs into the Olentangy River,

17:12.195 --> 17:14.213
and he dies a few days later of pneumonia.

17:14.214 --> 17:15.998
And here's his obit.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.603
All right. So, we see
how it ends for Bixby.

17:20.605 --> 17:21.971
What about Baldwin?

17:21.973 --> 17:23.606
It doesn't go well for him either.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.608
He ends up dying penniless and alone

17:25.609 --> 17:27.510
in a hotel in Philadelphia.

17:33.084 --> 17:37.820
I think this thing makes people act funny.

17:37.822 --> 17:40.523
So, what is this thing exactly?

17:40.525 --> 17:42.791
It's from the house.

17:42.793 --> 17:46.462
Over time, the house collected
all of these energies

17:46.464 --> 17:48.113
from people.

17:48.115 --> 17:49.532
Maybe the land was bad.

17:49.534 --> 17:51.400
And then, this, you know,

17:51.402 --> 17:55.304
collected that negative
energy from living people.

17:55.306 --> 18:00.042
And then, the house, like,
spit out this, like, entity.

18:02.246 --> 18:04.213
Like, almost like PK?

18:04.215 --> 18:06.081
Something like that.

18:06.083 --> 18:10.352
PK or entities created by
psychokinesis are very powerful

18:10.354 --> 18:12.821
and can physically
influence their environment.

18:12.823 --> 18:14.523
What's freaking me out about this one

18:14.525 --> 18:17.776
is that it was created by the
house instead of a person,

18:17.778 --> 18:21.530
and that's something
I've never seen before.

18:21.532 --> 18:24.300
It's definitely getting stronger, um,

18:24.302 --> 18:26.402
so that makes me concerned.

18:29.774 --> 18:31.106
So far, I've got clients

18:31.108 --> 18:33.809
that have been physically
assaulted by unseen forces

18:33.811 --> 18:36.512
and two former property
owners who went insane.

18:36.514 --> 18:38.180
But I've still got to see
if there's anything else

18:38.182 --> 18:41.016
that could help my case.

18:41.018 --> 18:43.218
Searching through old records,
I find a woman

18:43.220 --> 18:47.056
who killed her husband
during a forced baptism

18:47.058 --> 18:48.991
right next to Amy and Phil's property.

18:52.246 --> 18:54.096
Heading over to meet with a local pastor

18:54.098 --> 18:56.131
who agreed to look into this case for me.

19:02.857 --> 19:04.106
Jason, thanks for meeting me.

19:04.108 --> 19:05.574
I appreciate it. In all my time

19:05.576 --> 19:07.376
on the police department
and working homicides,

19:07.378 --> 19:12.498
I never had a case involving
a murder with baptism.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.083
And the reason I'm interested in his death

19:14.085 --> 19:16.251
is because it happened right
near my client's property.

19:16.253 --> 19:18.020
So, what do you know about this guy?

19:18.022 --> 19:19.371
William McCoy.

19:19.373 --> 19:22.825
He joined the National Guard
right before World War I,

19:22.827 --> 19:24.126
so it'd be 1917.

19:24.128 --> 19:26.629
He ended up going to Europe and serving.

19:26.631 --> 19:28.130
And while he was there,

19:28.132 --> 19:29.248
his battalion,

19:29.250 --> 19:32.868
or his squad,
got bombed by the Germans with gas.

19:32.870 --> 19:35.537
And he ended up having to come back.

19:35.539 --> 19:37.456
He was honorably discharged,

19:37.458 --> 19:40.309
and because of the damage to his lungs,

19:40.311 --> 19:42.244
tuberculosis sets in.

19:42.246 --> 19:43.545
Okay. So, what happens?

19:43.547 --> 19:46.799
He ends up actually meeting a lady,
Bertha Wilson.

19:46.801 --> 19:48.417
This is Bertha.

19:48.419 --> 19:52.021
And I guess they fell in love,
and they get married.

19:52.023 --> 19:56.592
By 1925, McCoy's lungs
have deteriorated so badly

19:56.594 --> 19:59.294
that he's being treated at
this hospital in Dayton,

19:59.296 --> 20:01.930
and they basically send him home to die.

20:01.932 --> 20:03.399
Okay.

20:03.401 --> 20:07.369
And they send him, basically,
to his foster parents' house

20:07.371 --> 20:08.737
here in Delaware.

20:08.739 --> 20:13.242
They called in a local Grace
Methodist Episcopal pastor

20:13.244 --> 20:15.678
to baptize him,

20:15.680 --> 20:18.180
but he does it by pouring or sprinkling.

20:18.182 --> 20:20.916
Bertha demands a different type of baptism.

20:20.918 --> 20:22.217
The only way in her eyes

20:22.219 --> 20:25.554
that he could truly know that
his soul was gonna be saved

20:25.556 --> 20:28.991
is if he was immersed in full baptism.

20:28.993 --> 20:30.926
She calls in this Reverend Pennell.

20:30.928 --> 20:33.145
They pull him off of his deathbed

20:33.147 --> 20:35.964
and immerse him in the water.

20:35.966 --> 20:39.001
He died very soon after the immersion.

20:39.003 --> 20:40.035
Okay.

20:40.037 --> 20:43.372
This is his death certificate.

20:43.374 --> 20:45.724
Now, was she ever officially charged?

20:45.726 --> 20:46.725
No.

20:46.727 --> 20:48.610
There's never charges filed.

20:48.612 --> 20:50.879
Mainly, the sheriff and so forth said,

20:50.881 --> 20:53.849
"Hey, he was gonna die in hours,

20:53.851 --> 20:55.350
or days at the most."

20:55.352 --> 20:59.088
Now, how did this sit
with the foster parents?

20:59.090 --> 21:01.457
Well, I mean, they were opposed to it.

21:01.459 --> 21:02.841
They were opposed to the immersion.

21:02.843 --> 21:04.960
They... They didn't want that to happen.

21:08.165 --> 21:10.949
I'm seeing the angry young woman again.

21:10.951 --> 21:16.455
She told me it was 1910, 1915, and 1925...

21:16.457 --> 21:20.509
were very important years for her.

21:20.511 --> 21:25.631
She and the mother-in-law... You know,
they had issues.

21:25.633 --> 21:27.316
They butted heads.

21:27.318 --> 21:29.768
The daughter-in-law didn't
want to be here anymore,

21:29.770 --> 21:32.821
and she didn't want to live that life.

21:32.823 --> 21:37.059
I think she did, you know,
some pretty bad stuff.

21:37.061 --> 21:40.763
She's blaming the land for her actions

21:40.765 --> 21:43.365
and how she became.

21:43.367 --> 21:48.654
Maybe that the land brings
out the worst in people

21:48.656 --> 21:52.224
is kind of, I think,
what she's trying to say.

21:52.226 --> 21:54.359
So, yeah, I think it's her husband,
and I think...

21:54.361 --> 21:55.394
I think she killed him.

22:13.022 --> 22:15.156
I never know how wide Amy will open,

22:15.158 --> 22:18.893
so I look into the property and
the surrounding neighborhood.

22:18.895 --> 22:21.596
Now, during my research,
one thing caught my eye...

22:21.598 --> 22:24.365
a teenage kid who brutally
murdered his girlfriend

22:24.367 --> 22:27.451
right near Amy and Phil's property.

22:27.453 --> 22:29.620
I'm heading over to meet with
a Delaware police captain

22:29.622 --> 22:31.939
who said that killer is now a free man.

22:41.568 --> 22:44.318
So, Captain, the reason
I asked you to help me out is,

22:44.320 --> 22:46.954
I found that article about
a homicide back in '53.

22:46.956 --> 22:48.589
Involved a young girl, uh,

22:48.591 --> 22:49.857
who was murdered less than a mile

22:49.859 --> 22:51.192
from my clients' property.

22:51.194 --> 22:53.744
What do you know about the
victim in the case itself?

22:53.746 --> 22:57.265
Well, she was a former
Ohio Wesleyan student.

22:57.267 --> 22:59.300
Her name was Cynthia Pfeil,

22:59.302 --> 23:02.370
and she was 18 years old.

23:02.372 --> 23:04.071
Okay.

23:04.073 --> 23:06.307
The gentleman that
murdered her and was convicted

23:06.309 --> 23:11.679
of her murder was a gentleman
by the name of Roy Schinagle.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.381
What was their relationship?

23:13.383 --> 23:18.019
They had, uh,
dated for approximately two years.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.670
So, how does the murder take place?

23:19.672 --> 23:21.389
- What happens?
- Well, what we know is,

23:21.391 --> 23:24.308
on September 16, 1953,

23:24.310 --> 23:28.195
Cynthia's lifeless body was found along
"a lonely road,"

23:28.197 --> 23:30.248
I believe, is the way it was referred to.

23:30.250 --> 23:31.616
Okay.

23:31.618 --> 23:35.336
Her body showed that she had
been strangled or choked.

23:35.338 --> 23:37.972
Her face had been
bludgeoned to such an extent

23:37.974 --> 23:41.375
that she was unrecognizable.

23:41.377 --> 23:43.511
Wow.

23:43.513 --> 23:46.047
He, uh, confessed to the crime,

23:46.049 --> 23:48.916
that he had choked her
and also bludgeoned her.

23:48.918 --> 23:51.736
So, was she choked to death,
and then he beats her?

23:51.738 --> 23:53.588
I mean, do we have any idea what happened?

23:53.590 --> 23:55.690
We really don't know for sure,

23:55.692 --> 23:56.857
but it's been surmised

23:56.859 --> 24:00.411
that he possibly bludgeoned
her at that point

24:00.413 --> 24:02.763
to prevent her from being recognized.

24:02.765 --> 24:04.632
And we don't know what the motive was?

24:04.634 --> 24:05.766
Right.

24:05.768 --> 24:08.686
It was reported that Roy
and her had an argument.

24:08.688 --> 24:09.870
I believe he's quoted

24:09.872 --> 24:12.206
as referring to it as a
"silly little thing"

24:12.208 --> 24:13.507
they argued over.

24:13.509 --> 24:14.675
All right. So, now, what happens?

24:14.677 --> 24:16.811
He gives the confession.

24:16.813 --> 24:18.980
He was indicted for a
first-degree murder trial

24:18.982 --> 24:20.948
and found guilty of second-degree murder

24:20.950 --> 24:24.085
on October 24, 1953.

24:24.087 --> 24:26.420
He served 10 years and was paroled.

24:26.422 --> 24:29.607
That's extraordinary
how quick that happened.

24:29.609 --> 24:30.691
Yes.

24:30.693 --> 24:32.693
Mr. Schinagle is... is alive.

24:32.695 --> 24:34.362
He's 81 years old,

24:34.364 --> 24:38.916
and he's still living somewhere in...
in the state.

24:45.775 --> 24:47.642
Something happened.

24:47.644 --> 24:50.945
Um... I don't know.

24:54.617 --> 24:57.518
I just see some chick getting beat up.

24:57.520 --> 24:59.353
Mm.

24:59.355 --> 25:01.422
She's just getting hit in the head.

25:01.424 --> 25:05.042
The brunette...
The brunette gets knocked down.

25:05.044 --> 25:06.627
She blacked out.

25:06.629 --> 25:09.163
Doesn't even know what
[bleep] hit her, you know?

25:09.165 --> 25:10.665
But, like, there's a male.

25:10.667 --> 25:12.566
She knows this guy. She knows this guy.

25:12.568 --> 25:15.169
I don't know how old they are.

25:15.171 --> 25:16.170
I don't know.

25:16.172 --> 25:19.040
Probably between [bleep]

25:19.042 --> 25:21.275
I don't know, 17 to 20s.

25:21.277 --> 25:23.611
- I don't know.
- Okay.

25:23.613 --> 25:26.931
Feeling choked.

25:26.933 --> 25:28.683
Like, pressure on my neck.

25:31.387 --> 25:37.191
I hear a male voice saying,

25:37.193 --> 25:41.896
"I'm gonna make you pay."

25:44.467 --> 25:47.868
And then, I hear "[bleep]"

25:47.870 --> 25:49.637
Oh, my God.

25:59.382 --> 26:00.498
During my walk,

26:00.500 --> 26:03.918
I saw a dead young woman
who was extremely angry.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.419
I'm meeting with a sketch artist

26:05.421 --> 26:09.040
to describe how she appeared in life.

26:09.042 --> 26:13.310
She's probably about 17 years old.

26:13.312 --> 26:16.247
Her eyes are deep-set,

26:16.249 --> 26:20.735
and she has pretty thick eyebrows.

26:20.737 --> 26:23.003
Next, I described a living person

26:23.005 --> 26:26.006
being attacked by this thing.

26:26.008 --> 26:30.077
It looks like it came out of a swamp.

26:30.079 --> 26:35.616
It was, like,
putting its hand over the person's face.

26:35.618 --> 26:38.786
And it was putting the other hand,
like, here.

26:44.927 --> 26:46.694
Is this what you saw?

26:50.416 --> 26:52.900
Yes, that's what I saw.

27:13.151 --> 27:16.352
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:16.354 --> 27:17.653
we're ready to reveal our findings

27:17.655 --> 27:21.491
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

27:21.493 --> 27:24.694
Amy, I want you to meet Phil and Amy.

27:24.696 --> 27:26.846
They're newlyweds,
but their life's been anything

27:26.848 --> 27:28.264
but a honeymoon.

27:28.266 --> 27:30.666
Now, Amy moved in here
about four months ago

27:30.668 --> 27:31.934
with her two kids.

27:31.936 --> 27:34.871
And this is a photo of
the whole family here.

27:34.873 --> 27:37.707
- This is Jerrick, who's 15...
- Oh. Okay.

27:37.709 --> 27:39.792
And Matthias, who is 10.

27:39.794 --> 27:42.979
The weird thing is that until
Amy moved in here with the kids,

27:42.981 --> 27:44.947
the place was relatively quiet.

27:44.949 --> 27:47.233
And then, all hell broke loose.

27:47.235 --> 27:48.785
Amy's very religious,

27:48.787 --> 27:52.288
and her priorities in
life are God and her kids,

27:52.290 --> 27:53.956
but she doesn't think
either one of those things

27:53.958 --> 27:55.958
are welcome here.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.761
So, now that Amy knows a little
bit about your family dynamics,

27:58.763 --> 28:00.730
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

28:03.334 --> 28:04.934
So, the first person that I met

28:04.936 --> 28:06.869
was a female who was telling me

28:06.871 --> 28:12.191
how she felt like this was
hell for her to be here.

28:12.193 --> 28:14.677
She looked nice.

28:14.679 --> 28:19.899
A very well-dressed, uh,
attractive woman, young.

28:19.901 --> 28:23.986
Her husband made her come here,

28:23.988 --> 28:26.773
and it was all, like, dirt.

28:26.775 --> 28:32.361
Her mother-in-law was here,
and they did not get along.

28:32.363 --> 28:34.030
The younger lady

28:34.032 --> 28:38.534
was talking about how she was really pissed

28:38.536 --> 28:40.420
that her husband brought her here,

28:40.422 --> 28:43.072
that she couldn't be fancy anymore.

28:43.074 --> 28:45.775
And then, she was saying how she was gonna,

28:45.777 --> 28:48.945
uh, give him a taste of his own medicine.

28:48.947 --> 28:55.418
I kind of thought that
maybe she killed him.

28:55.420 --> 28:57.653
She gave me three very specific years...

28:57.655 --> 29:01.224
1910, 1915, and 1925.

29:01.226 --> 29:05.561
She said that these were
very important years for her.

29:05.563 --> 29:08.097
I got an idea who you
might be talking about.

29:08.099 --> 29:11.367
Now, you said the young woman
mentioned 1910, 1915, 1925.

29:11.369 --> 29:15.188
Yes. Well,
I don't know anything about 1910 or 1915,

29:15.190 --> 29:18.541
but 1925 is definitely significant.

29:18.543 --> 29:20.843
That year, an incredibly strange death

29:20.845 --> 29:22.245
took place next to your property.

29:22.247 --> 29:25.848
In the early 1920s,
a woman from here named Bertha Wilson

29:25.850 --> 29:29.519
married a World War I vet,
this guy, William McCoy.

29:29.521 --> 29:33.523
McCoy winded up getting gassed
by the Germans in World War I

29:33.525 --> 29:35.091
and developed TB from it.

29:35.093 --> 29:38.794
In 1925, his condition got really bad.

29:38.796 --> 29:40.530
He was sent home to basically die,

29:40.532 --> 29:43.616
and he was sent home to his foster parents,

29:43.618 --> 29:45.701
who lived right next door.

29:45.703 --> 29:47.470
Because he only had days to live,
his parents

29:47.472 --> 29:50.056
had a Methodist minister come
in and do a baptism for him...

29:50.058 --> 29:52.942
what they call a sprinkling.

29:52.944 --> 29:55.211
But Bertha,

29:55.213 --> 29:58.614
she wanted her husband to be
baptized in a full submersion.

29:58.616 --> 30:01.350
Problem was,
his foster parents were against that

30:01.352 --> 30:03.753
because his health was so bad.

30:03.755 --> 30:08.925
Despite the arguing between
Bertha and McCoy's parents,

30:08.927 --> 30:10.459
on April 9, 1925,

30:10.461 --> 30:14.564
she hired a minister to come
in and perform this baptism.

30:14.566 --> 30:18.751
And within minutes after him
going into this tub of water,

30:18.753 --> 30:21.120
he dies.

30:21.122 --> 30:22.371
Now, according to the death certificate,

30:22.373 --> 30:25.308
they say he dies from tuberculosis.

30:25.310 --> 30:26.893
Now, I got a newspaper article here

30:26.895 --> 30:30.680
that shows there was a coroner's inquest,

30:30.682 --> 30:36.068
and they put the blame on
Bertha and the minister.

30:36.070 --> 30:37.853
Bertha was never charged.

30:37.855 --> 30:40.223
I guess they were thinking
he was gonna die anyway,

30:40.225 --> 30:42.058
but they never charge her.

30:42.060 --> 30:44.493
I've got a photo of her.

30:44.495 --> 30:48.231
This is her. This is Bertha Wilson.

30:48.233 --> 30:50.516
Huh.

30:50.518 --> 30:52.301
Is it possible that might
be the woman you saw?

30:52.303 --> 30:56.556
Well, I-I did have a sketch done of her.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.397
Looks like her.

31:06.751 --> 31:09.201
Mm-hmm. You can definitely...

31:09.203 --> 31:11.454
Even the eyebrows and everything
kind of looks the same.

31:11.456 --> 31:12.705
The brows, definitely.

31:12.707 --> 31:15.558
So, this lady's in my house.

31:15.560 --> 31:17.326
Yes.

31:19.397 --> 31:22.298
Is it possible she's doing bad things now?

31:22.300 --> 31:24.133
Yeah.

31:24.135 --> 31:25.768
Well, she kept showing me horrible things

31:25.770 --> 31:27.937
she did throughout her life.

31:27.939 --> 31:29.839
She was a sociopath.

31:31.943 --> 31:33.843
Anything else?

31:33.845 --> 31:35.778
Then, I went into the basement,

31:35.780 --> 31:37.780
and there were these two people

31:37.782 --> 31:42.451
that ran past me down the stairs.

31:42.453 --> 31:44.487
And finally, when I got down in there,

31:44.489 --> 31:48.591
I saw the group of people that were,
like, hunched down.

31:48.593 --> 31:53.462
As far as the living picking
up on this would be, you know,

31:53.464 --> 31:59.135
these transient feelings of extreme fear,
uh, panic,

31:59.137 --> 32:00.970
or anxiety.

32:00.972 --> 32:02.104
You hate the basement.

32:02.106 --> 32:03.506
Mm-hmm.

32:03.508 --> 32:07.293
When I go down there,
I don't ever feel like I'm alone.

32:07.295 --> 32:09.178
I feel like there's someone watching.

32:09.180 --> 32:10.846
Did you say something before about...

32:10.848 --> 32:12.932
At the top of the stairs,
people went past you?

32:12.934 --> 32:15.051
- Yeah.
- Tell Amy what happened.

32:15.053 --> 32:17.003
I was going down the stairs

32:17.005 --> 32:21.524
and went flying completely down the stairs,

32:21.526 --> 32:24.377
felt like I was bumped or pushed...

32:24.379 --> 32:27.063
- Okay...
- and landed up against the wall,

32:27.065 --> 32:30.383
and I laid there and
screamed for several minutes.

32:30.385 --> 32:32.968
Now, with all the stuff that's
going on in the basement,

32:32.970 --> 32:34.403
could that have caused her fall?

32:34.405 --> 32:37.423
Actually, I think it could be the woman.

32:37.425 --> 32:41.143
I just feel like it's something
she would be capable of.

32:41.145 --> 32:43.679
It explains a lot of things.

32:43.681 --> 32:45.047
See, what I don't get is,

32:45.049 --> 32:47.616
you're very devout. Right.

32:47.618 --> 32:51.103
This woman, in my opinion,
was a zealot, but...

32:51.105 --> 32:53.823
I don't think that she was a good person.

32:53.825 --> 32:55.057
It actually scares me

32:55.059 --> 32:58.828
'cause I don't know what
else she's capable of doing.

32:58.830 --> 33:01.297
Is she gonna start targeting my kids?

33:03.401 --> 33:04.567
So, what else happened?

33:04.569 --> 33:05.735
Did you stay in the basement?

33:05.737 --> 33:06.769
No.

33:06.771 --> 33:08.087
So, I went upstairs,

33:08.089 --> 33:13.142
and actually, everything kind of changed.

33:13.144 --> 33:15.344
It was not good.

33:15.346 --> 33:20.783
There was this very bizarre
thing that I was seeing.

33:20.785 --> 33:23.719
This thing is very physical.

33:23.721 --> 33:25.287
One of the things I saw it doing

33:25.289 --> 33:28.474
was moving very quickly in the hallway area

33:28.476 --> 33:33.879
and, uh, touch on the doors,
you know, bang them.

33:33.881 --> 33:37.333
I think that people would hear this.

33:37.335 --> 33:40.236
It looked like it came out of a swamp

33:40.238 --> 33:42.671
because, like,
things were hanging off of it.

33:42.673 --> 33:44.039
It's very dark.

33:44.041 --> 33:46.575
Um, you know, it has, like,
a head and arms and stuff,

33:46.577 --> 33:48.577
but it's, like, different.

33:48.579 --> 33:51.647
Well, Amy and her son Jerrick

33:51.649 --> 33:54.633
see this shadow figure all the time.

33:54.635 --> 33:57.153
And it does move in the hallway,
back and forth,

33:57.155 --> 33:58.854
back and forth, back and forth.

33:58.856 --> 34:00.206
Do you ever hear the banging on the door?

34:00.208 --> 34:01.974
Yes. Our doors will slam.

34:01.976 --> 34:03.809
We'll hear doorknobs rattle,

34:03.811 --> 34:08.197
and I've seen it standing
beside my bed at night

34:08.199 --> 34:10.565
almost, like, towering over me.

34:13.137 --> 34:15.204
And you saw the same thing?

34:15.206 --> 34:16.272
Yeah. I just saw...

34:16.274 --> 34:18.324
It was just jet black.

34:18.326 --> 34:20.042
But what scared me the most

34:20.043 --> 34:22.110
is, you can see right through its eyes.

34:22.112 --> 34:25.214
- Oh.
- Distinctive.

34:25.216 --> 34:26.549
And what else can this thing do?

34:26.551 --> 34:33.222
What I saw in the smaller bedroom,

34:33.224 --> 34:35.752
so I'm assuming your
younger son's bedroom.

34:35.777 --> 34:36.442
Mm-hmm.

34:36.444 --> 34:38.860
When he's asleep

34:38.862 --> 34:42.164
is when it has its interactions with him.

34:42.166 --> 34:47.335
And it was putting its hand into his face.

34:50.658 --> 34:52.491
He won't sleep in his room.

34:52.493 --> 34:54.810
He is scared to death of his room.

34:54.812 --> 34:58.214
Matthias is autistic, as well.

34:58.216 --> 35:02.051
Unfortunately,
the influence of this thing is,

35:02.053 --> 35:06.322
people being prone to anger and rage,
bursts of it.

35:06.324 --> 35:12.161
So it'll pick a person, uh,
for you to get angry at.

35:12.163 --> 35:14.363
You bicker now like you never did before.

35:14.365 --> 35:15.898
- Right.
- Unfortunately, yeah.

35:15.900 --> 35:17.633
We love each other a lot,

35:17.635 --> 35:20.419
but we have arguments about things

35:20.421 --> 35:23.506
that never would have
become an argument before.

35:23.508 --> 35:25.090
Jerrick's mood has changed, right?

35:25.092 --> 35:26.342
His personality a little bit?

35:26.344 --> 35:28.344
He has less of a tolerance.

35:28.346 --> 35:29.845
With his brother being autistic,

35:29.847 --> 35:32.097
he's quick to get more irritable with him.

35:32.099 --> 35:33.816
Okay.

35:33.818 --> 35:35.184
Interesting.

35:35.186 --> 35:37.820
One incident that I saw in the main...

35:37.822 --> 35:39.071
the master bedroom,

35:39.073 --> 35:43.459
uh, was of an encounter with a female.

35:43.461 --> 35:45.127
I feel her neck hurts.

35:45.129 --> 35:48.163
Like, her spine in her neck, you know?

35:48.165 --> 35:50.900
Then, it, like, slams her.

35:53.437 --> 35:54.570
Tell her what happened.

35:54.572 --> 35:56.155
One second, I was writing.

35:56.157 --> 35:58.657
The next second, I wake up on the floor.

35:58.659 --> 35:59.909
I had been unconscious.

35:59.911 --> 36:02.511
I had hit my head and
sustained a concussion.

36:02.513 --> 36:06.098
But where I landed was so far
away from where I was sitting

36:06.100 --> 36:08.901
that it wasn't like I simply passed out

36:08.903 --> 36:10.252
and fell out of my chair.

36:10.254 --> 36:13.038
And they did have to put
me in a cervical collar.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.624
I was up in the air about
it being paranormal.

36:15.626 --> 36:18.594
Yeah, I don't think you believed it.

36:18.596 --> 36:20.563
Is that something this thing could do?

36:20.565 --> 36:24.366
Oh, yeah. I think so, yeah.

36:24.368 --> 36:28.337
The place where it made me really,
really nervous

36:28.339 --> 36:30.306
was in the middle bedroom.

36:30.308 --> 36:32.241
That's Jerrick's room.

36:32.243 --> 36:36.245
What I felt was, like,
a hand around your throat.

36:36.247 --> 36:38.964
It was, like, a pressure, like, on my neck

36:38.966 --> 36:41.951
and then a pressure, like, on my chest.

36:41.953 --> 36:46.121
I did have a sketch done of that.

36:53.864 --> 36:55.598
Ah, geez.

36:58.052 --> 36:59.835
I'm sorry.

37:22.568 --> 37:26.269
I did have a sketch done of that.

37:34.379 --> 37:35.845
Ah, geez.

37:38.033 --> 37:39.049
I'm sorry.

37:54.266 --> 37:56.700
Okay. Sorry.

37:56.702 --> 38:00.136
No, don't be sorry. It's your son.

38:00.138 --> 38:03.423
Has he ever relayed that
kind of feeling to you?

38:03.425 --> 38:08.211
He wakes up feeling awful almost every day.

38:08.213 --> 38:09.646
He did convey to me,

38:09.648 --> 38:11.348
when I interviewed him that,
uh, he was sitting on the bed,

38:11.350 --> 38:13.099
watching TV.

38:13.101 --> 38:15.001
And it felt like a man's hand

38:15.003 --> 38:17.487
had slapped him right across the thigh.

38:17.489 --> 38:19.973
That would be similar...
along the lines of...

38:19.975 --> 38:22.025
of what this thing can do.

38:24.196 --> 38:25.929
I don't want that to happen to Jerrick.

38:25.931 --> 38:28.798
I don't want it to happen
to anybody in this house,

38:28.800 --> 38:32.352
but I didn't expect to
see something like that.

38:32.354 --> 38:34.104
What does this thing want?

38:34.106 --> 38:38.758
It has a real disdain for your son.

38:38.760 --> 38:41.511
It definitely wants to harm him...

38:43.081 --> 38:44.781
without a doubt.

38:49.554 --> 38:51.888
Amy, remember when you told
me that whatever is here

38:51.890 --> 38:53.690
is evil and doesn't want
you or the kids here?

38:53.692 --> 38:55.275
- Yes.
- Well, unfortunately,

38:55.277 --> 38:56.860
you were right.

38:56.862 --> 38:59.429
Now, the big question is,
can you get rid of this thing,

38:59.431 --> 39:01.881
protect your kids,
and live the life that you guys

39:01.883 --> 39:03.583
want to live here as a family?

39:03.585 --> 39:05.869
So, for that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:07.939 --> 39:12.676
Well, this case is cause for concern.

39:12.678 --> 39:14.310
So, basically,

39:14.312 --> 39:16.830
what we have is an
environment that has created

39:16.832 --> 39:20.917
a semi-functioning PK manifestation.

39:20.919 --> 39:22.686
What it did, seemingly,

39:22.688 --> 39:26.089
was, over time,
the house absorbed personalities,

39:26.091 --> 39:30.110
situations, memories,
things that it witnessed

39:30.112 --> 39:35.498
and then, eventually, spit out an entity.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.618
Now, usually, PKs are formed by people.

39:38.620 --> 39:42.706
This is the first time I've
seen one formed by a house.

39:42.708 --> 39:45.041
And the reason it's become so active

39:45.043 --> 39:50.046
since you've moved in is your son.

39:50.048 --> 39:53.216
I believe he has PK abilities.

39:57.439 --> 40:00.657
I think that, because there was already

40:00.659 --> 40:04.060
a semi-functioning PK manifestation here

40:04.062 --> 40:05.979
and he came in,

40:05.981 --> 40:09.115
it was the perfect storm.

40:09.117 --> 40:13.069
And I think that he really needs help.

40:15.741 --> 40:18.074
I knew something bad was going on here.

40:18.076 --> 40:20.443
I knew something did not want us here.

40:22.514 --> 40:26.783
Well, the problem is that there's not a lot

40:26.785 --> 40:29.919
that can be done about this.

40:29.921 --> 40:34.290
But if you take him away
from this location,

40:34.292 --> 40:38.294
any attacks would cease.

40:38.296 --> 40:43.366
But this thing will still exist here,
which is unfortunate.

40:43.368 --> 40:44.434
But in the interim,

40:44.436 --> 40:46.102
- Jerrick's not safe.
- No.

40:46.104 --> 40:48.838
And you guys aren't safe.

40:52.194 --> 40:55.361
Honestly, I would leave.

40:55.363 --> 40:57.247
When a PK is formed by people,

40:57.249 --> 40:59.582
there are things they can
do to protect themselves.

40:59.584 --> 41:02.118
But, in this case,
when it's formed by the house,

41:02.120 --> 41:06.656
there are only two options...
tear it down or get out.

41:06.658 --> 41:10.310
I've already been assaulted twice, I feel.

41:10.312 --> 41:13.062
And seeing what's happened to my son,

41:13.064 --> 41:14.647
they're both gonna be sleeping with me

41:14.649 --> 41:18.501
until we can figure out
a way to get out of here.

41:18.503 --> 41:21.321
That's gonna be something
that we'll have to talk about.

41:21.323 --> 41:24.741
No.

41:24.743 --> 41:27.010
I'm their mom. My job's to protect them.

41:27.012 --> 41:30.380
It's just not a chance I'm willing to take.

41:30.382 --> 41:34.184
- Okay.
- It's just the way it is.

41:34.186 --> 41:36.186
So, it sounds like your wife
already made up her mind.

41:36.188 --> 41:38.471
Yeah. It's a shock.

41:38.473 --> 41:40.390
We knew something was going on...

41:40.392 --> 41:44.260
- Right...
- but not to this extent.

41:46.248 --> 41:48.515
Yeah. We'll be... We'll be leaving.

41:48.517 --> 41:50.033
Okay.

41:50.035 --> 41:52.235
It breaks my heart
to tell Amy and Phil

41:52.237 --> 41:54.587
that I believe they
should leave their home.

41:54.589 --> 41:56.172
But if they don't, I fear this house

41:56.174 --> 41:58.274
and the PK manifestation it's created

41:58.276 --> 42:01.511
could put them and their
children in serious danger.
