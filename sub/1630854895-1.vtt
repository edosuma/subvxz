03:41.137 --> 03:42.597

Exactly.

How's yours looking?
You ready to provide for the family?

03:50.188 --> 03:51.147
Yeah.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.359
- Let's go kill something.
- You don't have to say it like that.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.194
Yeah. That's exactly what we're gonna do.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.279
It sounds so barbaric, like...

and they was gonna give you money
to read books?

04:16.297 --> 04:17.882
Well, it was a scholarship.

04:18.883 --> 04:22.053
And I don't know if I'd have gotten it.
It's whatever now.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.556

07:14.016 --> 07:15.643
Yeah, why didn't you do that, actually?

07:15.643 --> 07:17.728

See you, island!

Yeah, just tuck on in.
Let's, uh, get this shit going.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.912
So what were you doing
all the way out here?

14:32.413 --> 14:34.832

14:39.044 --> 14:40.337
You know, the usual.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.506
Wahoo.

14:47.845 --> 14:51.599
I'd hang on to something.
Gets a little spicy on takeoff.

 Doc said you're doing good
and getting better.

15:22.671 --> 15:25.925
Don't worry, in the meantime,
I'm already taking care of business.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.179
I've almost got the new papers ready,
you know?

15:30.179 --> 15:32.139
Passports, bank accounts.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.307
I got this.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.643
Okay? Just like you taught me.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.813
I got it all planned out. All right, I do.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.902
Not Rose. She doesn't know
what the hell she's doing.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.991
Listen, the gold's in the vault.

15:52.201 --> 15:55.746
Just like you left it,
and I'm dealing with the cross.

15:56.956 --> 15:57.831
Okay?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.960
You'll see for yourself when you wake up.

16:09.343 --> 16:13.430
...<i>one-niner-four-six.
This is tower operator on the mainland.</i>

16:13.430 --> 16:18.727
<i>Vector 705. Maintain altitude through 1K...</i>

16:19.353 --> 16:21.146
Wahoo don't run in September.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.314
Ever. All right?

16:22.314 --> 16:25.025
So whoever this man is,
he's not a fisherman.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.655
Maybe the run
just starts earlier out here.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.157
Are you sure about that? In the Caribbean?

16:32.157 --> 16:34.076
...<i>we'll have you heading south.</i>

16:34.076 --> 16:36.078
No, I know what this is.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.080
He's working for my dad,

16:38.831 --> 16:41.583
and he's probably been looking
for us the entire time.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.420
All right, we gotta find out.

16:45.587 --> 16:49.508
Start looking for some sort of... clues.

16:57.641 --> 17:00.227
-  Hey, Jimmy.
- Yeah. What's up?

17:00.227 --> 17:02.896
- How long you had this bird?
-  Oh, about ten years now.

17:02.896 --> 17:07.234
-  How long you been flying?
-  I've been flying all my life.

17:07.234 --> 17:10.112
Uh, who's that lovely lady right there?

17:10.612 --> 17:14.033
That right there?
That's Cynthia. Yeah.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.201
-  Cynthia?
-  Yeah...

17:18.662 --> 17:21.206
And what about
that beautiful girl right there?

17:21.206 --> 17:22.124
Huh?

17:23.542 --> 17:24.752
Oh, that? That's Stacey.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.254
Oh! Oh, your sister?

17:27.254 --> 17:28.589
No, no.

17:28.589 --> 17:32.342
No, she's just this girl I met
in Saint Lucia. You ever been there?

17:32.342 --> 17:35.429
-  The Coastal Venture. Oh my God.
-  Huge marlin. You gotta go.

17:35.429 --> 17:39.099
This is the boat we were on.
With Eberhimi and the cross.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.393
- So he was looking for us?
-  Exactly.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.103
He's working for my dad.

17:44.188 --> 17:48.442
Hey, y'all better hold something.
We got some unexpected turbulence up here.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.237
Guys, whatever it is,
it's happening fast. Look.

17:53.697 --> 17:57.117
That looks like Barbados.
I've been there with Terrance.

17:58.911 --> 17:59.828
Okay,

17:59.828 --> 18:02.206
there's six of us, one of him.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.710
- You know my vote. We storm the cockpit.
- No, who's gonna fly the plane, dumbass?

18:06.710 --> 18:11.215
- I've seen Pope fly simulators.
- I crop-dusted for my uncle last summer.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.549
This is not the same thing.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.718
We don't have time to pretend
that's a real option.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.762
- Do you have an idea?
- Something safe.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.973
Why don't we just wait
until the plane lands somewhere safe,

18:19.973 --> 18:21.391
and then we sneak out.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.852
And if somebody comes to mess with us,
we mad-dog them.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.270
-  Okay.
-  Okay.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.941
- I like the mad-dogging part.
- Just put that back.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.442
Put it back. Be cool.

18:34.863 --> 18:38.325
Hey, Jimmy. Is that Burning Man?
Right there?

18:38.867 --> 18:41.703
Yeah! That's Burning Man,
all right. That was my first time.

18:41.703 --> 18:45.415
- How many times you been to Burning Man?
-  I started going when I was 18.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.001
- GT's, baby! GT's!
-  Yeah, I've heard a lot about it.

18:48.001 --> 18:51.839
- I've never been west.
- Hey, man! What the hell are you doing?

18:53.465 --> 18:55.008
That's mine!

18:55.008 --> 18:56.051
Who are you really?

18:56.051 --> 18:57.010
Fly the plane!

18:57.010 --> 18:58.679
It's my book. Give it back.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.681
Please fly the plane.
Please fly the plane.

19:02.349 --> 19:05.519
- Come on. Come on, Fish. Come on, Fish.

19:11.692 --> 19:14.486
- Come on, Fish. Come on, Fish. Come on.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.821
Come on, Fish.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.198
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-  Beneath!

19:39.261 --> 19:40.929
Guys. Guys.

19:40.929 --> 19:42.598
- Is everybody good?

19:42.598 --> 19:44.975
JJ! Wake up, man. We gotta get out.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.393
We gotta get out of here.

19:50.772 --> 19:53.483
-  We gotta get out before it sinks.

19:53.483 --> 19:56.612
-  Oh no. They don't look friendly.

19:56.612 --> 19:59.156
- No, they look very unfriendly.
-  We gotta go. Come on.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.073
We gotta go.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.658
-  Jump.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.243
- Come on, hurry.
-  We gotta get out.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.579
- We gotta go now, come on.
-  Go, Pope.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.874
- Kie, let's go.
- I'm coming. Go!

20:09.791 --> 20:12.294
Kie, get out before it sinks!

20:12.294 --> 20:15.088
- Come on. Go!
-  They're headed this way.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.298
-  Hurry.
- Hang on!

20:16.882 --> 20:18.425
No, no, no, Kie! Come on!

20:18.425 --> 20:21.428
- Come over here. Get to the pier.
-  Kiara, come on. You gotta hurry.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.471
Now go!

20:29.144 --> 20:30.229
Portis.

20:30.229 --> 20:34.107
Come on.
Portis, wake up. Wake up!

20:43.659 --> 20:45.661
Come on, guys, hurry up. Hurry up.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.498
I got you.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.794
Wait, where's Kie? You guys, where's Kie?

20:54.962 --> 20:56.380
She went the other way.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.969
Take him.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.179
- You okay?

21:06.848 --> 21:09.351
-  Thank you.
- You lied to us.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.477
Who are you?

21:10.978 --> 21:13.522
-  Oh God.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.232
You should get out of here.

21:15.857 --> 21:16.858
Shit.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.701
Oh my God. Oh my God.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.129
-  Get out of the way!
-  Come on up.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.047
Policemen. Search all over the area.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.941
She's over here!

22:02.279 --> 22:04.489
-  Get off!
-  Get a hold of her.

22:06.074 --> 22:08.744
Let me go!

22:09.786 --> 22:12.122
Damn it! What are we...
what are we gonna do?

22:12.122 --> 22:13.415
Go after her, right?

22:13.415 --> 22:14.708
What... what can we do?

22:16.543 --> 22:18.670
- Over there.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.173
Where are they taking her?

22:21.173 --> 22:24.509
- They're all right there.
- They're looking this way. We gotta go.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.012
We gotta go, JJ.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.514
JJ, come on.
We can't save her if we get caught.

22:29.514 --> 22:30.599
That's it.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.395
<i>We lost the others.
We'll keep searching.</i>

22:38.482 --> 22:40.400
I saved your life.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.487
I know. I know. I'm sorry.
I gonna try to help you, okay?

22:43.487 --> 22:46.323
I swear, I didn't know
it was gonna be like this.

22:46.323 --> 22:49.117
Look, if you don't fight,
if you just do what they say,

22:49.743 --> 22:52.579
these guys prob... probably won't hurt you.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.706
What did Ward promise you?

22:55.791 --> 22:56.875
Who?

22:58.210 --> 23:00.754
Hey, just take my advice,
do what they say.

23:02.422 --> 23:03.423
Good luck.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.433
-  All right, let's go.

23:27.489 --> 23:30.200
Again, thank you both for coming.
I know it was a long way to travel.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.035
But I think what we have is...

23:32.577 --> 23:33.829
is pretty worthwhile.

23:33.829 --> 23:36.873
Yes. Well, Michel is
the most prominent antiquities dealer

23:36.873 --> 23:37.958
of the West Indies.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.962
- Unfortunately, he only speaks French.
- No English.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.089
- Yeah.
-  Mm.

23:44.089 --> 23:47.050
What is... what is French for priceless?

24:11.241 --> 24:12.492
Uh, may he touch it?

24:13.076 --> 24:15.620
- Knock yourself out, Michel.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.577
He wants to know where you found it.

24:56.745 --> 24:59.247
Don't worry about it. We got it.
That's all he needs to know.

24:59.247 --> 25:02.083
It's here. It's for sale.
So who can we get to buy it?

25:11.801 --> 25:15.222
Uh, for a piece like this of this value,
there are very limited buyers.

25:15.222 --> 25:17.724
- Uh, like an institution, a museum.

25:22.395 --> 25:26.441
But he has a client
in Barbados who will be interested.

25:32.614 --> 25:36.618
This client will have lots of questions.
He'll want to meet with you in person.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.457
Call this number
to arrange everything.

25:42.457 --> 25:43.500
You... you phone.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.335
-  Yes.
-  Very important.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.878
Very important. Very good.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.382
Let's make a deal?

25:51.174 --> 25:52.634
Let's make a deal.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.851
Eberhimi was right.
They do have it.

26:01.851 --> 26:03.562
And Michel says it’s real.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.565
Let's invite him to dinner then.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.774
Will do.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.404
What the hell was that?

26:12.946 --> 26:16.199
Why would they want to kidnap Kiara?
It doesn't make any sense.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.284
It's called bait.

26:18.076 --> 26:21.621
-  I am so sick of this.

26:21.621 --> 26:25.333
Do you think
there's any way we could trust the cops?

26:25.333 --> 26:26.668
The cops? You're joking, right?

26:26.668 --> 26:29.504
You seriously think
your daddy hasn't called them already?

26:30.338 --> 26:33.800
I have a crazy idea.
Why don't we call my parents?

26:33.800 --> 26:36.595
- And say what, Pope?
- And say we're alive.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.472
I haven't seen my family
in I don't know how long.

26:39.472 --> 26:41.391
They're probably worried sick about me.

26:41.391 --> 26:44.227
We can just call and maybe ask them
to wire us some money or something.

26:44.227 --> 26:47.022
-  And put them in danger?
- I got a better idea.

26:47.647 --> 26:48.857
And faster.

26:48.857 --> 26:49.941
Whose is that?

26:50.525 --> 26:52.527
You think I'm gonna go through
someone's backpack

26:52.527 --> 26:53.987
and not pinch their wallet?

26:53.987 --> 26:56.906
"Jimmy Portis, 101 Cattle Wash."

26:56.906 --> 26:59.618
I bet that's where they got Kiara.
All right?

27:00.160 --> 27:02.203
- That's where we're going.
-  That's conceivable.

27:02.203 --> 27:05.749
- But can we at least think this through?
- You got a better idea, Pope?

27:06.249 --> 27:08.835
Come on, 101 Cattle Wash.
That's where we're going.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.356
All right, let them in.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.506
Take her upstairs.
The Orinoco Room.

28:36.506 --> 28:37.549
This way.

28:39.801 --> 28:40.760
Up.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.266
- Inside.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.020
Why am I here? Who are you working for?

28:51.521 --> 28:52.731
Dinner at eight.

28:53.231 --> 28:54.399
I'd clean up.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.776
Just tell me what they want!

29:31.644 --> 29:33.480
I don't have time
for this, Rose, okay?

29:33.480 --> 29:35.356
I gotta get to Bridgetown.
I'm taking the boat.

29:36.524 --> 29:39.861
Come on, Rafe.
You don't even know this guy.

29:40.820 --> 29:43.239
You can't just go out
and try and make a deal, Rafe.

29:43.239 --> 29:45.116
- That's so risky.
- I can't?

29:45.116 --> 29:47.410
I know you think
you know what you're doing.

29:47.410 --> 29:50.914
But there are people out there
that know your dad is alive. No!

29:50.914 --> 29:52.999
Not just people, Pogues.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.459
Pogues, Pogues.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.045
Listen, they can't prove it.
They don't know where we are.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.213
Sarah does!

29:58.213 --> 30:01.174
Oh, Sarah does!
Listen, Sarah's not gonna do shit, Rose.

30:01.174 --> 30:03.301
She's too afraid,
and if the Pogues show up,

30:03.301 --> 30:04.385
I'm just gonna handle it.

30:04.385 --> 30:05.804
You'll handle it?

30:05.804 --> 30:08.181
When have you ever handled
anything for us?

30:08.181 --> 30:10.850
- Rafe, everything you touch turns to--
- Hey! Hey!

30:12.227 --> 30:13.228
Listen.

30:14.103 --> 30:16.189
I'm gonna sell the cross that I found.

30:16.189 --> 30:18.608
Okay? That I saved, and when Dad wakes up...

30:18.608 --> 30:20.944
- Okay.
- ...he's gonna see that I took care of it.

30:21.945 --> 30:22.946
Not you.

30:24.697 --> 30:25.657
Sure.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.159
So why don't you go
have yourself another Tom Collins

30:28.159 --> 30:31.871
while I go make us all
a shit ton of money? Okay?

30:36.876 --> 30:38.878
You missed.

30:41.548 --> 30:43.466
Maybe you don't need another drink.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.222
And you think it's them?

30:49.222 --> 30:51.349
Mm, they fit
the description I heard.

30:52.058 --> 30:53.184
From who?

30:53.184 --> 30:55.436
I got the police report.

30:57.313 --> 31:00.024
Did they have a phone on them or anything?

31:00.024 --> 31:02.861
They were just rescued.
Off the Grenadines.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.195
They had nothing.

31:04.195 --> 31:07.198
That means no one else can track
them either. Maybe that's good.

31:08.283 --> 31:11.953
Why didn't you call him...
when you had a chance?

31:11.953 --> 31:14.330
Just let him know you're alive.

31:15.707 --> 31:19.419
You don't know how many times I wanted to,
but it would've put him at risk.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.381
And me, it was better I stayed dead.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.140
When he was a boy,

31:33.892 --> 31:36.019
I used to bring him home with the bells.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.197
Bring it on in, John B!

31:53.077 --> 31:54.537
Bring it on home, boy!

31:55.705 --> 31:57.206
Coming, Dad!

32:01.419 --> 32:02.337
Find my boy.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.384
And I will get you your shroud, I promise.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.098
Really helps
there's no names on the streets.

32:14.098 --> 32:15.850
Just let me handle it.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.352
101 Cattle Wash?

32:18.853 --> 32:21.856
- Blue house? Thanks, I appreciate you.
- Let's do it.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.487
This is it. Let's go around back.

32:33.743 --> 32:35.453
- Shh!
- My bad. Sorry.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.166
Hey.

32:40.667 --> 32:41.668
- Window?
-  Yeah.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.169
Here. You want some help?

32:43.169 --> 32:44.504
No, I got this.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.341
Careful.

32:48.341 --> 32:51.094
Whoa. Yo, get off!

32:51.094 --> 32:55.682
Get off! Dude, get o--

32:55.682 --> 32:57.392
-  Shh!

32:57.392 --> 32:59.602
- Hey! Shh!

32:59.602 --> 33:02.772
What are you doing? Does the element
of surprise mean nothing to you?

33:02.772 --> 33:04.565
-  It turned my thumb purple!
- Shh. Relax.

33:04.565 --> 33:05.775
It's just a crab, man.

33:05.775 --> 33:10.071
I'm being surrounded right now.
Goddamn it. Damn little sea spider.

33:12.657 --> 33:13.616
Shh!

33:17.996 --> 33:19.414
I'll take the front.

33:19.914 --> 33:20.957
Take the back.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.418
Kiara?

33:24.460 --> 33:25.420
Kie?

33:27.171 --> 33:29.132
-  Sarah, no one in there?
- No.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.092
-  No one there?
- There's no one in there.

33:32.552 --> 33:35.138
Okay. Well, if she's not here,
where is she?

33:43.563 --> 33:44.605
John B.

33:45.898 --> 33:46.941
John B?

33:50.862 --> 33:53.239
- Recognize that?
-  What? Find something?

33:53.948 --> 33:55.783
-  Holy shit.
- It's a burning boat.

33:55.783 --> 33:57.785
This is San Jose.

33:57.785 --> 33:59.579
It's from Denmark's diary.

33:59.579 --> 34:02.582
This is the ship
that Captain Limbrey stole the cross from.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.542
And the Merchant gold.

34:08.838 --> 34:09.881
 Great, whatever.

34:09.881 --> 34:13.301
It's just about the gold.
It's not about Kiara. It doesn't help us.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.553
Well, Portis is a treasure guy.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.264
This is too close to our boat.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.266
Just let it go.
That's not why we're here.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.561
Guys, guys, guys.

34:23.561 --> 34:24.645
What?

34:25.396 --> 34:27.982
- Shit. It's Portis.
-  Shit.

34:28.816 --> 34:30.735
- Yo, he's back.
- Do we run?

34:33.988 --> 34:35.239
Hey.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.282
Yeah.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.534
Yeah, they're pulling her out right now.

34:39.035 --> 34:42.330
I'm just really worried
about the electrical, all right? I--

34:42.330 --> 34:45.083
All right. All right.
I'll check in with you tomorrow.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.668
- Flying Fish, man.

34:52.882 --> 34:53.883
Damn it.

34:54.383 --> 34:56.219
I've had it with you guys.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.601
- Come here!

35:11.275 --> 35:12.235
I got him.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.694
- Get up!
- Okay, okay.

35:13.694 --> 35:14.612
- Okay.
- Sit down.

35:14.612 --> 35:17.073
You guys
really shouldn't be here right now.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.366
Where is she, Jimmy?

35:18.366 --> 35:19.450
Answer the man!

35:19.450 --> 35:21.744
You really don't wanna know.

35:21.744 --> 35:22.912
Talk.

35:22.912 --> 35:24.288
Who took her?

35:24.288 --> 35:25.748
Was it Ward?

35:26.916 --> 35:28.709
Ward? Who's Ward?

35:29.210 --> 35:32.171
You guys really don't understand
who you're messing with.

35:32.171 --> 35:34.549
-  We'll call the cops.
-  Sure, call the cops.

35:34.549 --> 35:38.427
See how far that gets you.
This guy owns the cops.

35:38.427 --> 35:42.014
He's got eyes all over the island
looking for you. All of you.

35:42.014 --> 35:44.392
He's a big man, the Kingfish.

35:45.017 --> 35:46.394
- The Kingfish.
-  Hey!

35:46.978 --> 35:49.272
- What's this?
- Hey, take your hands off my shit.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.023
- Hey, quiet down!
-  Shut up.

35:51.023 --> 35:52.066
- Quiet.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.734
-  What is it?

35:55.361 --> 35:56.529
Ah, man.

35:57.446 --> 35:59.866
What's that, Jimmy?
Is that the payoff?

36:00.575 --> 36:02.994
Is that the payoff for Kiara, Jimmy?

36:02.994 --> 36:03.911
Is it?

36:03.911 --> 36:05.538
-  Talk!

36:05.538 --> 36:07.915
Hey, what's Vaux Hall?

36:09.750 --> 36:12.587
You really don't want to go there, man.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.755
- That's the lion's den.
- That's it.

36:15.464 --> 36:17.300
That's where Kie is. Come on, Pope.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.720
- You really don't want to go there!
- Do we look afraid?

36:23.139 --> 36:24.056
You should be.

36:25.224 --> 36:26.726
Let's go. Come on, it's not worth it.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.811
Come on, Cleo. JJ, let's go! Come on!

36:28.811 --> 36:31.063
Portis, we're taking some clothes.
Deal with it.

36:31.063 --> 36:34.609
Big mistake.
You're just gonna make it worse for her!

36:37.737 --> 36:39.989
Hey, I didn't tell you shit, okay?

36:39.989 --> 36:41.282
Remember that!

36:50.333 --> 36:51.334
Shit.

36:55.129 --> 36:56.964
Pope, are you sure
you got the right address?

36:56.964 --> 36:59.467
I know you aren't talking to me
about having the right address.

36:59.467 --> 37:00.968
That's exactly what I'm asking.

37:00.968 --> 37:04.513
Look, the place says Vaux Hall.
Vaux Hall, it's on the map.

37:04.513 --> 37:07.225
- We don't know if that's where we are.
- It's in the general vicinity.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.518
Why don't we just ask someone?

37:09.518 --> 37:10.436
Hey!

37:12.355 --> 37:13.731
Pardon I.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.484
You know where we can find Vaux Hall?

37:16.984 --> 37:18.236
You kidding me, right?

37:18.236 --> 37:20.988
Everything you can see all around you
is all Vaux Hall.

37:20.988 --> 37:22.698
Wait, what do you mean? Like...

37:22.698 --> 37:24.909
All this, all this, all this.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.369
Oh, everywhere.

37:26.369 --> 37:27.662
Okay, so who lives up there?

37:28.371 --> 37:29.372
Carlos Singh.

37:30.164 --> 37:32.041
Just on the other side of that wall.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.961
But take it from me,
he's no one you want to get to know.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.422
Okay, thank you.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.049
- Thank you.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.690
He's ready.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.751
Uh, excuse me?

38:19.505 --> 38:22.174
No, I knew you and Ward
were behind this shit.

38:22.174 --> 38:24.677
What are you talking about?
You trying to weasel in on my deal?

38:24.677 --> 38:25.720
Is that what's going on?

38:25.720 --> 38:29.015
I wondered if your little reunion
would cause sparks, you know.

38:35.604 --> 38:36.564
Who are you?

38:38.274 --> 38:39.275
Me?

38:39.275 --> 38:40.943
My name is Carlos Singh.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.822
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Cameron.

38:45.823 --> 38:48.492
And Ms. Carrera, I do apologize

38:48.492 --> 38:50.745
for the rough tactics
in bringing you here.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.122
But please, come.

38:53.914 --> 38:54.915
Sit down.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.961
Come now, I don't bite.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.307
Rough tactics. What about me?

39:11.307 --> 39:13.976
Yes, Mr. Cameron, false pretenses.

39:13.976 --> 39:17.813
But the ends justify the means,
I'm afraid.

39:18.731 --> 39:19.732
Sit down.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.693
- We have a lot to talk about.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.029
Why are we here?

39:25.029 --> 39:28.616
Well, Ms. Carrera, Mr. Cameron,
we share certain interests, you know.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.076
Objectives.

39:30.576 --> 39:32.370
Is this not about the cross?

39:32.370 --> 39:33.704
It is.

39:33.704 --> 39:37.708
Tangentially, it is about the cross,
but it's also about something

39:37.708 --> 39:39.794
much, much bigger than the cross.

39:40.294 --> 39:41.712
By orders of magnitude...

39:42.421 --> 39:45.674
...the completion of a grand quest.

39:46.926 --> 39:47.968
You see,

39:47.968 --> 39:51.430
the story goes that 450 years ago,

39:51.430 --> 39:54.183
a Spanish soldier
came out of the Orinoco Basin

39:54.183 --> 39:56.268
with a few gold beads.

39:57.269 --> 40:00.272
And when they asked the Spanish soldier,
"Where the beads came from,"

40:00.272 --> 40:04.652
the Spanish soldier replied he got them
from a peaceful Indigenous tribe

40:04.652 --> 40:07.238
who lived in a city of gold.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.572
El Dorado.

40:08.572 --> 40:13.452
And for the next 450 years,
people tried to find that gold, you know.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.413
They tried.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.833
Conquistadors, knights,

40:18.833 --> 40:21.919
captains of ships, tribes,

40:21.919 --> 40:23.379
entire nations.

40:24.213 --> 40:27.925
All fighting each other
in a race for the end of the rainbow.

40:28.509 --> 40:29.927
Thousands of lives

40:29.927 --> 40:32.138
laid on the pyre of gold fever.

40:33.472 --> 40:35.266
And it falls to me, you know.

40:36.016 --> 40:38.477
It falls to me to complete the task.

40:39.854 --> 40:44.191
To bring full circle a quest
that has gone on for almost 500 years.

40:44.191 --> 40:47.236
Perhaps... perhaps the greatest quest

40:47.236 --> 40:49.822
in the history
of the western hemisphere, you know.

40:50.489 --> 40:51.782
And you two...

40:53.325 --> 40:55.619
...you two are going to play a part in that.

40:57.830 --> 40:59.582
What about you, Ms. Carrera?

41:00.332 --> 41:02.334
Are you interested in history?

41:02.918 --> 41:04.920
- I'm more of a future person.

41:04.920 --> 41:08.632
I didn't listen to a word you said, okay?
How much you gonna keep philosophizing?

41:10.468 --> 41:12.470
You are direct, aren't you, Mr. Cameron?

41:16.182 --> 41:17.683
What do you need from me?

41:18.976 --> 41:21.228
I've come to believe
that you and your friends

41:21.228 --> 41:24.523
are in possession of something
that can help me get what I want.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.818
- Which is?
-  An old manuscript.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.987
A diary, actually.

41:43.000 --> 41:43.959
Thanks!

41:45.419 --> 41:46.837
Oh shit! Wait!

41:47.588 --> 41:49.006
Sarah, get down! Quick!

41:51.926 --> 41:53.219
- You see him?
-  Shh!

41:55.179 --> 41:56.805
Oh man.

41:56.805 --> 41:59.350
Okay. Portis wasn't kidding.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.810
No, that's a fortress.
This is much bigger than Ward.

42:01.810 --> 42:05.231
We got two towers, patrollers,
ATVs, possibly snipers.

42:05.231 --> 42:07.274
There's no way we're getting past that.

42:07.274 --> 42:10.986
We gotta help her. We can take them
if we stay towards the tree line.

42:10.986 --> 42:12.196
No, Cleo! No, Cleo!

42:12.196 --> 42:13.364
- Hey!

42:14.114 --> 42:14.949
Shit.

42:17.910 --> 42:19.912
I have no idea what you're talking about.

42:21.539 --> 42:24.083
This is ridiculous.
I don't know anything about a diary.

42:26.335 --> 42:30.506
But how else could you have learned
that the cross was on the Royal Merchant?

42:31.340 --> 42:34.843
Look,
I want to help you, but I can't.

42:35.886 --> 42:38.013
I was hoping you wouldn't say that,
you know.

42:39.682 --> 42:42.184
Because unfortunately,
I don't believe you.

42:43.018 --> 42:45.980
You and your friend here
couldn't have found the cross without it.

42:45.980 --> 42:47.398
He's not my friend.

42:49.525 --> 42:51.610
We can't all be friends, you know.

42:51.610 --> 42:54.822
Look, this is ridiculous.
Okay? I'm out.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.575
I don't know anything
about a diary, okay? So--

42:59.368 --> 43:01.870
Do I look like a fool to you, Mr. Cameron?

43:02.788 --> 43:04.665
Do I look like a fool to you?

43:08.377 --> 43:09.795
You have the cross.

43:10.588 --> 43:13.299
She and she friends
had the cross at one point.

43:13.299 --> 43:15.384
So one of you has the diary.

43:17.636 --> 43:19.263
And if you really don't know,

43:19.263 --> 43:21.849
then I suggest you convince
your friend to tell me.

43:23.684 --> 43:25.185
Once I have the diary...

43:27.271 --> 43:28.689
you'll be free to leave.

43:40.576 --> 43:41.869
- Shh!
- Cleo.

43:41.869 --> 43:42.995
- Go!
- Shh!

43:50.169 --> 43:51.795
- Oh shit.
-  What do you see?

43:51.795 --> 43:54.089
Uh...

43:54.089 --> 43:55.716
- Hey, use your words. Words.
- What?

43:55.716 --> 43:57.468
- They're right there.
- Then just say that.

43:57.468 --> 44:01.055
All right. What we should do
is we should back up, all right?

44:01.055 --> 44:02.306
Because there's no way.

44:02.306 --> 44:03.807
-  JJ, get down.
-  Hey.

44:03.807 --> 44:06.185
There's an opening down that way.

44:06.185 --> 44:09.104
As soon as the guards turn around,
we just sneak in through the back.

44:09.104 --> 44:11.940
- Come on. Go, it's this way.

44:13.233 --> 44:17.029
Wait, you know what we should be doing?
Go down, take the sewers up--

44:17.029 --> 44:18.656
- What sewers?
- The sewers!

44:18.656 --> 44:19.907
This is all grassland.

44:19.907 --> 44:21.825
- There's no sewers.

44:23.827 --> 44:25.120
- What was that?

44:25.954 --> 44:27.998
What was that?

44:30.084 --> 44:32.670
I know that sound. Hold on.
All right, all right.

44:35.339 --> 44:38.258
Wait, what is that?

44:38.258 --> 44:40.135
-  It's a game cam.
- Oh shit!

44:40.803 --> 44:42.971
- Yeah, that's-- What?
- Mash it up. Mash it up.

44:42.971 --> 44:44.431
- Put it on the ground.
-  No!

44:44.431 --> 44:47.643
- Stop it. Give me that. Pull the battery.
-  Quick, before it transmits.

44:47.643 --> 44:49.520
-  Transmits?

44:49.520 --> 44:51.689
Pope, come on! Hurry up.

44:57.736 --> 44:59.780
Do you think we got it
before it transmitted?

45:01.573 --> 45:03.742
- No.
- Dogs, dogs. We gotta go.

45:03.742 --> 45:04.827
Go, go, go, go!

45:04.827 --> 45:07.121
- We gotta go, we gotta go.
-  Run!

45:07.121 --> 45:09.081
-  Go, go!

45:16.880 --> 45:19.007
Dogs, dogs! Go, go, go!

45:24.596 --> 45:26.890
Don't let them
make it to the wall!

45:26.890 --> 45:29.643
- Send the dogs. Send the dogs.

45:29.643 --> 45:30.811
Come on.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.020
Seek, seek.

45:33.480 --> 45:34.648
-  Dogs!

45:34.648 --> 45:35.941
- Dogs, dogs!

45:35.941 --> 45:37.151
Go, go!

45:37.776 --> 45:40.237
-  Come on, come on!

45:48.662 --> 45:49.705
Sarah, come on!

45:49.705 --> 45:52.040
- John B, hurry, get up here!

45:55.836 --> 45:57.379
Okay, cool. No, stay down!

45:57.963 --> 45:59.465
John B! John!

46:01.258 --> 46:02.718
Okay.

46:04.094 --> 46:05.637
-  Ah, cool.

46:05.637 --> 46:07.639
Series of bad decisions.

46:12.436 --> 46:14.396
What are we gonna do about Kiara?

46:16.732 --> 46:19.777
We'll think of something,
but we're not leaving her in there.

46:19.777 --> 46:20.819
Come on.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.948
Enjoy the grounds during your stay.

46:25.908 --> 46:27.409
I must warn you, though.

46:27.910 --> 46:30.162
I'm not a man of infinite patience.

46:32.539 --> 46:33.624
You have one day.

46:34.958 --> 46:37.544
Go to the window
for a little demonstration.

46:39.338 --> 46:41.006
I think you'll enjoy it, you know.

46:46.136 --> 46:47.179
Hey. Hey!

46:47.763 --> 46:49.723
- You're just done talking?

46:49.723 --> 46:51.350
- Hey!

46:53.143 --> 46:54.102
It's locked.

47:02.027 --> 47:04.780
Get off me, man!
I didn't do nothing, man!

47:06.073 --> 47:08.492
-  Who the hell is that guy?

47:08.492 --> 47:10.661
I know him. It's Jimmy Portis.

47:12.621 --> 47:14.122
He was trying to help me.

47:22.673 --> 47:23.882
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:35.185 --> 47:37.479
This diary.

47:37.479 --> 47:38.939
Hey, no bullshit.

47:38.939 --> 47:42.317
Don't bullshit me. Okay?
Do you have it?

47:42.317 --> 47:43.360
Kie?

47:48.699 --> 47:49.658
No.
