WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:05.171
[Mac] Well, this is
an interesting development.

00:05.297 --> 00:07.840
[Dennis] This is not good.
[Charlie] You think maybe he's just vacationing?

00:07.925 --> 00:11.344
No. Charlie, there's blocks in front and in
back of his tires. He's not going anywhere.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.346
Yeah. This guy's
planted himself here.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.306
And I tell you what, once all the other R.
V. Folks see what this R.V. guy is doing,

00:16.433 --> 00:19.018
they're gonna start parking their R.
V.'s on our street. Shit.

00:19.103 --> 00:22.021
We're gonna be staring down the
barrel of a shantytown situation.

00:22.106 --> 00:25.775
Oh, my God. Who just takes their vehicle and
parks in someone's, you know, street...

00:25.859 --> 00:28.903
and says, "This is my street.
I'm gonna live here now 'cause I'm poor"?

00:29.029 --> 00:30.863
I'll tell you who.
New poor. What?

00:30.948 --> 00:33.866
Ever since the recession hit, waves
of new people are suddenly broke.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.369
These people have no idea
how to live without money.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.538
They're what's called "new poor."
We're old poor.

00:38.622 --> 00:40.873
Yeah, they could stand to learn
a lesson or two from us,

00:40.958 --> 00:44.377
because we would never take our homelessness
and shove it down everybody's face.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.170
Have some class
if you're gonna be poor!

00:46.255 --> 00:48.464
All right. Let's get this guy out
of here, send him a message.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.508
Let's do it. Right.
Let's slash his tires.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.302
Well, not that though, because then he can't leave.
That doesn't make any sense.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.305
Well, you start putting plans under microscopes,
nothing's gonna make sense, all right?

00:56.390 --> 00:59.767
Lots of things make sense. Slashing someone's
tires so that they leave makes no sense.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.937
You gonna put everything I say under a microscope, bud?
It's a stupid idea, Charlie.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.982
I'm sorry.
You have a better plan?

01:06.066 --> 01:09.694
Dee! Sharpest item in the bar!
I need it now! Let's go!

01:09.778 --> 01:12.780
Whoa. What the hell's
going on over here?

01:12.865 --> 01:15.116
[Dee] Oh, Frank's
trying to kill himself.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.868
Is he all right?
Frank, are you all right?

01:16.994 --> 01:19.078
Don't try to stop me.
Oh, my God.

01:19.163 --> 01:24.041
- Oh, so he's alive. - I lost all my money
in a Ponzi scheme, Charlie. I'm broke!

01:24.126 --> 01:25.752
His neck is so thick,

01:25.836 --> 01:28.296
I feel like he's just gonna swing and
dangle around for a really long time.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.715
That's what it is!
Let's cut him down.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.342
Frank, it's not gonna work for you.
Your neck's too thick, buddy.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.846
- Tie a chair to me.
- Times are tough, huh?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.431
Shit.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.512
This is terrible.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.514
What? What are you talking about?
What is terrible?

02:19.640 --> 02:22.350
If you're looking for a better steak in an
arcade setting, you are shit out of luck.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.436
I'm talking about eating out all the time.
It's a business expense, Frank.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.481
It's only fair that the upper management
of the bar get together to talk shop...

02:28.565 --> 02:30.566
over top-notch steak
and some video games.

02:30.651 --> 02:34.821
You two have no idea how serious this is.
I can't bail you out anymore!

02:34.905 --> 02:37.073
Maybe we should take this time
to streamline Paddy's,

02:37.157 --> 02:38.741
make it run as efficiently
as the government.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.369
[Dennis] Mmm! Yeah.
Cut out the steak dinners.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.788
We're not cutting out the steak dinners,
so just hold your horses on that one.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.374
If anything, we should be talking about bonuses.
Let's talk bonuses. Good idea.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.042
Bonuses?
[Dennis] Yeah!

02:48.126 --> 02:50.419
You run the business into the
ground, and you want bonuses?

02:50.504 --> 02:54.048
Frank, don't be a moron. You start cutting
bonuses, you're gonna lose your top guys.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.634
You gotta separate the wheat
from the chaff somehow. Yeah.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.929
These dudes are all chaff. Right?
Yeah- Well, no. We're all wheat.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.889
No, we're chaff. No, we're not.
We're- We're wheat.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.100
Why would you want to be wheat?
Why would you ever want to be chaff?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.185
Well, who wants to be- Okay,
I'll be chaff, you be wheat.

03:06.270 --> 03:10.064
You two idiots have no
business sense whatsoever!

03:10.148 --> 03:13.067
We have no business sense?
He's the one dangling from a noose 10 minutes ago.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.694
[Laughs] That's a good point.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.280
Let's start streamlining right now.
Frank, you're out. You're fired.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.240
Oh! You just got
squeezed out, bitch!

03:19.366 --> 03:21.284
Oh, I'm squeezed out?
Uh-huh.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.452
Well, let's see how far
you two idiots get...

03:23.537 --> 03:26.080
without Frank Reynolds bailing
you out every five minutes!

03:26.164 --> 03:29.625
- I'm outta here! - I'm comfortable
being chaff if you want to be wheat.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.919
[Dennis] Okay, man, whatever.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.838
[Grunts]

03:35.924 --> 03:37.633
[Dee] You're firing us?

03:37.718 --> 03:40.595
Well, first we're gonna give you the
opportunity to defend your jobs.

03:40.679 --> 03:41.804
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.348
All right. I appreciate
the opportunity, fellas.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.684
- I'm on it! Whoo! - Good.
Show us what you do around here, Charlie.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.769
- Hoo-woo-woo-woo! - Oh, come on!
This is bullshit!

03:48.854 --> 03:50.855
I shouldn't have to
defend my job to you!

03:50.981 --> 03:55.026
Dee, we don't know what it is that you do around here.
You don't seem to do anything.

03:55.110 --> 03:58.112
Me? Come on!
I do a shitload!

03:58.196 --> 04:00.072
Why don't you make us a drink?

04:00.157 --> 04:02.825
Fine. I'll crack you
open a beer.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.619
No, no, no.
Not a beer.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.495
Something you have to mix.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.497
But this bottle
is cold-activated.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.583
I mean, look at it.
Doesn't that look delicious?

04:10.667 --> 04:12.043
It does look delicious,
but mix me a drink.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.712
But the mountains, they've turned blue.
Mojito me, please.

04:14.838 --> 04:18.089
A refreshing mojito would do.
Nobody orders a mojito in this bar.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.966
So you can't make a mojito?
Of course I can make a mojito!

04:20.093 --> 04:23.471
Then make one. Fine!
One mojito coming up, gentlemen.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.807
[Chuckling]

04:26.892 --> 04:28.351
I quit.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.311
Goddamn it! Shit!

04:30.437 --> 04:32.521
I was really looking forward
to firing her. Me too.

04:32.606 --> 04:36.567
Okay, boys,
let's talk rat traps, okay?

04:41.907 --> 04:43.908
Huh?
I need money.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.410
Huh? The guys were being
total knobs, so I quit.

04:46.495 --> 04:50.373
Also, you're really behind on my rent and
they're threatening to evict me, so... money.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.793
What part of "I am broke"
don't you guys understand?

04:53.877 --> 04:56.712
I tried to hang myself.
No more bailouts!

04:56.838 --> 04:59.924
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Not my problemo.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.592
What's with the briefcase?

05:01.677 --> 05:03.552
I'm gonna start a new business.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.722
I created an empire before,
and I can do it again.

05:06.807 --> 05:11.560
Huh. You are really good at making money.
Okay, I'm in.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.105
What are you talking about?
What value are you to me?

05:14.189 --> 05:15.731
I'm desperate,
so I'll do anything.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.859
Okay, that's good.
Are you willing to destroy your credit?

05:18.986 --> 05:21.862
It's never really been a problem before.
That's good. Hold that.

05:21.989 --> 05:25.241
We're gonna take out a big loan in
your name and get an office. Great.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.867
Okay, let's go.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.578
All right,
that's the rainwater barrels.

05:29.663 --> 05:34.667
Now let's talk about the trash. What do I do with the trash?
How do I dispose of the trash?

05:34.751 --> 05:37.211
I don't know. We disposed of the
trash in the Dumpster last night.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.839
What are you doing with it?
I am taking it to the furnace.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.341
- We have a furnace? - Absolutely.
Where do you think the heat comes from?

05:42.467 --> 05:45.094
You burn the trash in the furnace?
This bar runs on trash.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.762
This bar is totally green
that way.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.472
How is burning trash green?

05:48.557 --> 05:51.475
Uh, because I'm recycling the
trash into heat for the bar.

05:51.560 --> 05:55.104
And lots of smoke for the bar. I'm giving the
bar the good smoky smell that we all like.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.731
The bar smells like trash.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.733
That's the exact opposite
of green, Charlie.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.609
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.612
Well, I could put the trash into a landfill
where it's gonna stay for millions of years,

06:03.697 --> 06:05.990
or I could burn it up and get a
nice, smoky smell in here...

06:06.074 --> 06:08.659
and let that smoke go into the
sky where it turns into stars.

06:08.744 --> 06:12.163
That doesn't sound right, but I don't
know enough about stars to dispute it.

06:12.289 --> 06:15.041
It's right. No, it's not right.
All right, are we almost done?

06:15.167 --> 06:18.210
No, we're not done.
I got one more piece of business. What is it?

06:18.295 --> 06:20.379
Lastly, before I open
the bar in the morning,

06:20.464 --> 06:23.007
I always make sure
to turn on the Coors sign,

06:23.091 --> 06:26.302
let people know we got iced delicious
Coors in the bar, you know,

06:26.386 --> 06:28.721
and then, uh,
that's the last thing I do.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.931
Ol' Charlie's done
a lot of work around here.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.018
Charlie, that sign does
not say "Coors." Eh?

06:34.144 --> 06:36.520
Goddamn it. Come outside!
Come outside! Come outside!

06:36.605 --> 06:38.606
[Mac] Goddamn it.
Come outside.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.109
Closed!
It says "closed," Charlie!

06:42.194 --> 06:45.112
Okay. [Chuckles] Yeah, right.
I can see that now.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.198
But, you know, you can't really
read it from the inside.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.616
You can't read it
from the outside!

06:48.742 --> 06:50.743
You know what? Forget it.
I can read it!

06:50.827 --> 06:52.369
Are we done with this?
Have we gone through everything?

06:52.496 --> 06:54.955
Well, that was the last thing that I do, sure.
Okay, great. You're fired!

06:55.040 --> 06:56.749
No, come on.
You're not firing me.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.334
Yeah. Yeah.
No way!

06:58.418 --> 06:59.877
Oh, I'm sorry!
Oh, really?

06:59.961 --> 07:02.505
So you're gonna throw all the
trash in the furnace yourselves.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.508
And you're gonna filter the
rainwater barrel all by yourselves.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.427
And I suppose you're gonna fiddle with the
electricity every day all by yourselves...

07:08.512 --> 07:10.179
and siphon it from all
around the neighborhood.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.891
No. We're gonna call a trash man,
an electrician, and a plumber...

07:13.975 --> 07:16.852
and not turn the closed sign
on when the bar is open!

07:16.937 --> 07:19.855
[Horn Honking]

07:19.940 --> 07:21.857
[Mac]
No, God! What is this?

07:21.942 --> 07:24.318
[Dennis] Are you kidding me?
This is what I was talking about.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.530
We are gonna have a
shantytown here in no time.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.365
[Mac]
Shit! Goddamn it!

07:29.449 --> 07:30.908
Honey, I'm home!

07:30.992 --> 07:34.411
Feast your eyes on the new
headquarters of Reynolds and Reynolds.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.080
Frank and I
are starting a business.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.374
We sublet our apartments.
We're living in here.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.210
- Wait a second.
You subletted our apartment? - Yeah.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.838
Well, what the hell, dude?
I don't know if I can live in a trailer, man.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.715
You don't have to, Charlie.
It's kinda tight in there already.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.844
Well, hang on a second, bro.
We're good in tight spaces. I'll make it work.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.929
I'm sorry, Charlie.
What do you mean, you're sorry?

07:52.055 --> 07:56.142
There's no room at the inn.
You kidding me, dude? You kidding me?

07:56.268 --> 08:00.354
Unbelievable! So now I'm reduced to
sleeping in the bar! Oh, hell no!

08:00.438 --> 08:02.481
No, no, no. You're not gonna
be sleeping in the bar.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.817
Where am I gonna live?
On the streets? It's a recession.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.652
Times are tough. Yeah.
You'll bounce back, buddy.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.238
Aw, come on, man.
Can I at least live with you guys?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.031
[Both Laughing]

08:11.116 --> 08:13.701
We're not in the business of giving out
handouts, Charlie. We're not the government.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.912
Frankly, I'm a little embarrassed that you would ask.
Yeah, it's a little gauche.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.706
You guys are boning me, man.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.750
I tell you what, why don't you and
I hit D&B's and talk bonuses?

08:21.835 --> 08:24.670
Yeah. All right. Dennis, why don't
you go ahead and lock that door.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.380
You don't have
to lock the door.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.382
Go ahead and lock him out.
Keep out the riffraff.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.968
You don't have to lock the door.
You don't have to add insult to injury. I'm gonna be fine.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.135
That's locked?
Yeah.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.471
- I got plenty of places to go.
- No, you don't!

08:34.556 --> 08:36.890
Okay, Frank, tell me about this
business scheme you're cooking up.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.226
Give me your shoe.
My shoe?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.812
Hand over your shoe.
All right.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.524
Observe.

08:45.609 --> 08:48.444
Wait. No, no, no-
Oh- Aw, come on, man!

08:48.570 --> 08:50.779
That's a $200 shoe!
[Laughing]

08:50.906 --> 08:52.865
Look at that.
What are you doing?

08:52.949 --> 08:57.286
Feast your eyes
on your new business.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.246
Knives.

08:59.372 --> 09:03.042
You want me to sell knives door-to-door?
No. You're selling vacuums.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.960
I'm sorry. I took out
a high-interest loan...

09:05.045 --> 09:08.881
to invest in a door-to-door knife
and vacuum-selling business?

09:08.965 --> 09:11.091
Not just any vacuum.
This is wet vac.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.093
Commercial power for the home.

09:13.178 --> 09:16.805
This'll get a red wine stain
out of anything. Look.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.683
Oh, goddamn it!

09:19.768 --> 09:22.645
[Laughing]
Check it out, Deandra.

09:23.647 --> 09:26.315
All right,
this baby is powerful!

09:26.399 --> 09:30.903
Now, cover your ears
because it has no muffler!

09:30.987 --> 09:33.530
- [Motor Roaring]
- Oh!

09:36.910 --> 09:38.410
[Shouts]

09:41.248 --> 09:45.751
[Motor Continues Roaring]

09:56.638 --> 09:58.806
Ah!
Oh, that's good merlot.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.433
Yeah. That's good merlot.
You're gonna want to keep those coming.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.435
It might be cheaper if youse
went with a bottle of wine...

10:03.520 --> 10:05.312
instead of chugging
the individual glasses.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.774
Mmm. Yeah, maybe leave the judgment
back in the kitchen 'cause...

10:08.858 --> 10:11.360
There's a little bit of a look of judgment
on your face. Just go grab them and...

10:11.486 --> 10:13.529
Okay, no problem. All right.
Okay. Thank you.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.863
Great!
Oh, she's terrific.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.991
I like her. Yeah, she's a cutie.
All right, listen, Mac.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.493
I did bring you here for a
specific reason, okay? Hmm?

10:19.577 --> 10:23.038
I got an idea for a stimulus plan for the
bar that's gonna blow your freakin' mind.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.665
Stimulus plan? A stimulus plan.
You want to hear it?

10:24.791 --> 10:26.917
Lay it on me, bro.
Take a look around you right now.

10:27.043 --> 10:31.255
Now, at a time where businesses are simply
failing left and right, who's thriving?

10:31.381 --> 10:34.758
Dave & Buster's. Dave & Buster's is thriving.
Why do you think that is?

10:34.884 --> 10:37.970
I don't know. Video games?
Video games are definitely a big part of it.

10:38.054 --> 10:41.724
I want you to do me a favor. Break down for
me what I'm holding in my hand right now.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.101
Ah, that is
a Dave & Buster's Power Card.

10:44.227 --> 10:48.397
Yes. Now, does your Dave & Buster's card
work at any other similar establishments?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.232
Like, say, a T.G.I. Fridays?

10:50.358 --> 10:53.652
Mine does not, and believe me, I've tried
at several locations. No, it doesn't.

10:53.737 --> 10:57.406
Yeah, 'cause I've actually been with you on
many of those occasions where you've tried.

10:57.532 --> 11:00.326
Right. I don't think I've tried it enough.
I think you have.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.619
Because clearly, at this point, you should've
realized that it doesn't work anywhere else.

11:02.704 --> 11:05.205
There's one in Franklin Mills I haven't tried.
I feel like that could maybe work.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.375
It's not gonna work there either. Let's move past that.
I'm trying to make a point here.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.336
When you come to Dave & Buster's
you spend your real money,

11:10.420 --> 11:12.338
but you leave with
Dave & Buster's money.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.214
That gives you incentive to
come back to Dave & Buster's...

11:14.299 --> 11:16.216
'cause it's the only place
where your money works.

11:16.301 --> 11:19.845
I think that's brilliant.
Maybe we should take a page out of D&B's book.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.556
And try the card at the Friday's
out in the northeast...

11:22.640 --> 11:25.017
No, you son of a bitch.
We're way past that at this point.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.019
I don't understand why you
can't grasp that point.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.897
It doesn't work anywhere else.
It's only gonna work here.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.816
All right. I'm- I'm getting all worked up.
Okay? This is- Let's...

11:32.901 --> 11:35.736
I'm proposing that we print
our own currency, okay?

11:35.862 --> 11:37.696
Make our own money?
Yes!

11:37.781 --> 11:41.492
We call it Paddy's Dollars. Now we distribute
that out to people for free initially.

11:41.576 --> 11:44.536
Then they become customers, and
then they bring in new customers.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.956
And then once they're in, they have to
use real dollars to buy Paddy's Dollars.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.959
That's exactly right, and that
stimulates our own internal economy.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.670
Yeah, yeah, dude! That's a great plan!
Then afterwards, we'll go out to Fox Chase...

11:53.755 --> 11:55.464
and use the Power Card
at that Friday's out there.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.342
Yeah, yeah, yeah! No, we won't.
You can though.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.266
Look, Mom, um, I've kinda
come on some hard times...

12:06.351 --> 12:08.560
with the economy
and everything.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.188
I got no place to go
and everything, so...

12:11.272 --> 12:13.816
I was figuring maybe I should move back
into my old room for a little while...

12:13.900 --> 12:15.859
till I get back up on my feet.

12:15.944 --> 12:19.405
Mmm, well, I don't think
that's gonna work out, Charlie.

12:19.531 --> 12:22.324
Why not? I had to sublet
your room to Uncle Jack.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.410
Is that why he's here?

12:25.453 --> 12:27.329
Hey, Charlie.
Times are tough.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.040
And the economy is so bad...

12:30.125 --> 12:33.961
I needed to get more money in in
order to make the house payments.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.004
What are you talking about?
You don't make house payments.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.507
You own this house. You've owned it for years.
Mom, that's crazy.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.801
- You collect Social Security.
- I need money.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.887
You can share the room
with me, Charlie.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.639
[Gasps] That's a great idea!

12:45.723 --> 12:48.267
- That is not a great idea.
- Well, why not?

12:48.351 --> 12:49.643
It'll be fun.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.604
You know, you and me
palling around, getting nuts,

12:52.689 --> 12:54.314
doing crazy, fun things.

12:54.399 --> 12:58.527
I'm not doing any kind of things that
you want me to do with you, Uncle Jack.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.280
No, it's- it's stuff
that relatives do.

13:01.364 --> 13:05.701
- We'll share the room, Charlie. - I don't want
to share the room with you, dude, because I...

13:05.827 --> 13:10.289
I will spend the whole night wide awake like
when I was a kid and you tried to share my room.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.374
You ever seen wrestling
on television?

13:12.459 --> 13:14.376
I am well aware
of what wrestling is.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.795
It's just not what uncles
do to their nephews.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.798
I'm out of here.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.593
Hey, I'll call you later.
I know you will.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.803
[Woman] Just grab any knife?

13:24.888 --> 13:27.097
Just the sharpest one
in the kitchen.

13:27.182 --> 13:31.185
[Whispering] All right, now when I cut
through the shoe and make the sale,

13:31.311 --> 13:34.229
you suggest casually that we have
a drink to celebrate. Right.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.857
And? Then I drop a little
wine on the carpet,

13:36.983 --> 13:39.860
grab the wet vac, and then call
it a deal, whatever. Zing-o.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.612
This is the best knife I own.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.655
Oh. Oh.
All right. Mmm.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.283
Well, if that's
the best you have...

13:46.367 --> 13:50.579
All right, now pretend that this
shoe is an unboned chicken...

13:50.663 --> 13:53.290
and you're gonna cook it tonight
and make a tasty dinner...

13:53.374 --> 13:55.542
that's gonna smell all through
the house like cooked chicken.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.836
Actually, I'm vegan.
Okay.

13:57.921 --> 14:01.381
Then pretend this shoe
is whatever you people eat.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.592
Maybe it is a shoe.
Nice one.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.845
Watch the way your knife cuts.

14:06.971 --> 14:11.058
Mmm. Oh, it's just flopping around.
Oh, shoot. I-It, you know, doesn't...

14:11.142 --> 14:13.936
Shit's not even making a dent
in the leather.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.730
This knife is a piece of crap.
Mm-hmm.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.400
Oh.
Now take a look at our knife.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.986
Beautiful pressed steel...
Oh.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.948
With a nice,
razor-sharp edge.

14:26.032 --> 14:31.078
Watch the way this knife blasts
through this shoe with one motion.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.622
Uh-huh.
Owww!

14:33.706 --> 14:36.959
Ohh! Ohh!
Is this part of the whole thing?

14:37.043 --> 14:39.586
Oh, I cut myself!
Ohh! It's a deep cut!

14:39.671 --> 14:42.256
Ohh! Ohh!
I see your bones!

14:42.340 --> 14:44.466
- It's a deep cut! - I'll get you a towel!
I'll get you a towel!

14:44.551 --> 14:47.970
- Oh, Frank! - It's okay. It's all right.
I got Band-Aids in my bag.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.639
I just- I need
your bathroom, that's all.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.641
Okay. All right.
I'll just get my bag. Okay.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.643
Ohh! Okay.
But...

14:54.769 --> 14:56.478
Eew.
Is he gonna be okay, 'cause...

14:56.563 --> 14:59.481
Yeah. Yeah, no, no.
He's gonna be fine, Beth. Don't worry.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.775
I tell you what- Why don't you
and I have a glass of wine.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.195
Just bring it down a little bit, huh?
I don't drink in the morning.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.115
Yeah, me neither.
Oh, uh...

15:08.241 --> 15:09.908
Oh, shoot!
Oh!

15:10.034 --> 15:11.535
Oh, I'm missing it!
Hey!

15:11.661 --> 15:13.036
Oh, no!
You're doing that on purpose!

15:13.162 --> 15:16.915
I'm trying to prove a point here, Beth, okay?
Hmm? I- I don't...

15:17.041 --> 15:19.001
[Stumbling, Crashing]
I'm gonna...

15:19.127 --> 15:22.546
Okay, I-
Yeah. Oh, boy.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.634
[Grunting]

15:27.719 --> 15:29.928
[Groans]

15:30.013 --> 15:32.889
Goddamn it!

15:32.974 --> 15:35.309
- These Paddy's Dollars
look great, bro. - Yeah!

15:35.435 --> 15:37.853
I'm really glad we went with the color.
They pop! Oh, yeah.

15:37.979 --> 15:40.022
Little bit more expensive than I would've thought.
But that's worth it though.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.690
That's
an old-poor move.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.318
You take your money and put it into
something worth it, you're not tacky.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.778
See, by transferring all of our
cash into these Paddy's Dollars...

15:46.904 --> 15:51.199
and then printing more of these babies than
we ever had in cash, we've upped our value.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.659
Shit!

15:52.744 --> 15:55.787
[Dennis] Oh, goddamn it.
Look.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.332
Full-blown shantytown.
We're screwed.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.959
Wait a minute. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, dude.

16:01.044 --> 16:04.296
There could be some
real opportunity in this.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.548
Yeah? Yeah, man.
Think about this, dude.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.384
In recession times, what thrives
more than anything else?

16:09.510 --> 16:12.346
Prostitutes. No- Well, yeah, that.
But that and bars.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.765
Oh, and bars! Well, yeah!
Right, because people gotta drown their sorrows.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.475
Get drunk!
We own a bar!

16:16.559 --> 16:18.477
Yeah! So why don't we take
these Paddy's Dollars...

16:18.561 --> 16:20.896
and just distribute them
amongst the shanties?

16:21.022 --> 16:23.690
That way- Right. They buy the
booze from us with the dollars.

16:23.775 --> 16:27.069
Right. They run out of booze, then they
gotta buy more Paddy's Dollars from us.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.696
Thus creating the self-sustaining
economy we've been looking for.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.281
It stimulates our economy.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.325
That's what Dave & Buster's does.
Give me one up here.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.868
Boom.
Boom!

16:34.994 --> 16:38.038
Who wants some free money, shanties?
[Laughing]

16:42.168 --> 16:45.587
When people stop buying vacuum
cleaners and knives door-to-door,

16:45.672 --> 16:47.589
it can mean only
one thing, Deandra.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.967
That you blew all of my money
on a very stupid idea? No!

16:51.052 --> 16:53.595
Good-bye, recession,
hello, depression.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.432
You're very lucky that you're with
somebody as resilient as Frank Reynolds.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.769
You've tried to off yourself two
times in the last 24 hours, Frank!

17:00.853 --> 17:04.271
Listen, this business partner of mine called.
He's got a great plan.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.400
This is the man
who's gonna make us rich.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.651
This is the man?
Yes.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.069
This man lives in a cardboard box!
Times is tough.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.780
Goddamn it.
Yo!

17:11.864 --> 17:13.906
Hey!
[Grunts]

17:13.991 --> 17:15.909
Thanks for getting
down here so quick.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.368
It's Charlie?
[Laughing] Hey, Charlie!

17:17.453 --> 17:19.371
Charlie is
your new business partner?

17:19.454 --> 17:22.290
Yeah. Well, what do you want?
We're good in tight spots.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.876
That's right. All right.
You ready to do this? You got it.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.670
Okay, let's go! Let's go!
You're the man with the plan.

17:26.753 --> 17:28.714
Deandra, this is gonna work.

17:28.840 --> 17:32.300
[Grunting] There we go.
Look at that.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.429
- Feast your eyes.
- Here we go!

17:35.513 --> 17:37.639
- [Charlie Yells]
- What the hell is that?

17:37.724 --> 17:42.519
These are crabs!
Fresh, local Delaware runoff crabs.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.312
Those don't look
anything like crabs.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.898
Huh? Yeah, well- They
look like sea scorpions.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.234
Isn’t there some kind of, like,
sewage runoff around here?

17:49.318 --> 17:53.447
Yeah, there's a pretty bad sewage runoff,
but, you know, crabs is sewage-proof!

17:53.531 --> 17:55.907
And depression proof.
People gotta eat.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.118
We're gonna sell these
on the street.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.495
- We're crab people now.
- Crab people.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.913
We're crab people now?
Yes!

18:01.998 --> 18:03.415
You want us
to become crab people?

18:03.541 --> 18:04.916
That's your new business plan?
Yeah...

18:05.001 --> 18:07.836
[Phone Ringing] Yeah.
I'm getting a call.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.046
We'll live and die
by the crab, Dee!

18:10.131 --> 18:12.340
We'll eat off
the fat of the sea.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.761
Help me toss some of these babies back, 'cause
legally we're not allowed to eat those.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.764
Oh, thank you very much!
Thank you. Great news!

18:18.848 --> 18:21.099
Let's go!
Forget the crabs! Okay.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.145
- Nice doing business with you.
- All right, shanty!

18:25.271 --> 18:26.855
Enjoy it! All right.
Enjoy yourselves.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.356
Boom!
Okay.

18:28.483 --> 18:29.775
Hey!
We did it.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.985
I think we made every single one
of our Paddy's Dollars back.

18:32.111 --> 18:35.113
You're damn right. Thus creating the
self-sustaining economy we've been looking for.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.282
That's right.
How much fresh cash did we make?

18:37.408 --> 18:39.242
Fresh cash?
Yes.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.870
Uh, well, zero. Zero, if you're
talking about U.S. currency.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.748
People didn't really seem
interested in spending any of that.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.208
That's okay.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.251
So when they run
out of the booze,

18:48.336 --> 18:50.712
they'll come back in and they'll
have to buy more Paddy's Dollars.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.423
Right. That is assuming, of course, that
they will come back here and drink.

18:53.508 --> 18:56.551
They will because we'll
redistribute these to the shanties,

18:56.636 --> 19:00.180
thus ensuring them coming back
in, keeping the money moving.

19:00.264 --> 19:03.016
Well, no, if we just redistribute these,
then people will continue to drink for free.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.852
Okay.
How does this work, Mac?

19:05.937 --> 19:07.729
The money keeps moving
in a circle.

19:07.814 --> 19:11.274
But- But we don't have any money.
All we have is this.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.986
How does this work, dude?
I don't know. I thought you knew.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.697
I thought you- What?
I thought you were on top of this!

19:17.824 --> 19:20.700
You're the one that came up with the plan!
Did I come up with this plan?

19:20.827 --> 19:24.871
Last night, dude, with the D&B Power Card
and the- Oh, I blacked out that night.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.290
Shit, dude! I've been following
your lead! Oh, Jesus.

19:27.416 --> 19:31.670
Oh, shit. Okay, so we have
no money and no inventory.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.756
There's still something we can do.
That's still a business somehow.

19:34.841 --> 19:38.593
How does D&B's do it? They've got a complicated system.
I cannot begin to understand it.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.346
How does a self-sustaining
economy work?

19:41.472 --> 19:46.059
I don't understand how the U.S. economy works,
much less some sort of a self-sustaining one.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.019
I don't understand
how finances work.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.563
Shots for everybody!

19:49.647 --> 19:54.025
The government is reimbursing me
all the money I lost!

19:54.110 --> 19:56.903
I love this country!
Baby, I'm back!

19:57.029 --> 20:00.532
Wait, you got a bailout?
Yeah, you know it, pal!

20:00.616 --> 20:04.452
Can you bail us out, Frank?
Because we're kind of screwed here.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.289
I'll tell you what.
Let's discuss it over steaks and Skee-Ball.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.249
Oh!
[Laughing, Yelling]

20:09.375 --> 20:11.251
Hey, bailouts all around!
U.S.A.!

20:11.377 --> 20:13.461
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
I love this country!

20:13.546 --> 20:15.463
[Charlie] Crab meat!
Crab meat! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

20:15.548 --> 20:17.799
- Crab meat!
- Crab meat!

20:17.884 --> 20:20.468
Uh, you guys don't think that you're
going to Dave & Buster's, do you?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.345
Uh-
What?

20:59.425 --> 21:02.302
