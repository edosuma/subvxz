00:02.100 --> 00:04.590
NARRATOR: Previously, on Stargate SG-1.

00:04.700 --> 00:07.900
Welcome, ye Knights of the Round Table.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.960
Prove ye worthy, and all shall be revealed.

00:13.170 --> 00:15.570
MITCHELL: So you're in the Ori galaxy?
VALA: Yes.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.240
Me carrying this child right now
is a problem, a big problem,

00:18.350 --> 00:21.870
but, believe me, there is one
which is much, much bigger.

00:22.180 --> 00:23.650
The ships are planning to Iea ve.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.150
Somewhere out there,
the Ori have a working supergate.

00:26.250 --> 00:28.920
Merlin was conducting research
on some kind of new invention.

00:29.020 --> 00:31.890
A weapon capable
of destroying ascended beings.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.120
I don't need to know Ancient
to understand what that is.

00:34.230 --> 00:35.860
A gate address
to where he hid the weapon.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.690
Every ally we have
and everyone else in this base

00:37.800 --> 00:40.170
has already devoted themselves
to finding the supergate.

00:40.270 --> 00:41.260
Go.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.970
MlTCHELL: Hey, has anyone stopped to
think how this thing might possibly work?

00:48.710 --> 00:51.580
I mean, how do you kill something
that's pure energy?

00:51.680 --> 00:54.080
JACKSON: Well, technically Merlin's
research didn't refer to killing.

00:54.180 --> 00:58.140
A better translation would be
"neutralizing" or "canceling out."

00:58.550 --> 01:01.020
MlTCHELL: Well,
that still begs a lot of questions.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.020
How do you aim
at something you can't see?

01:03.120 --> 01:05.750
JACKSON: Clearly, it can't be a weapon
in the conventional sense.

01:05.860 --> 01:08.990
See, ascended beings transcend
ordinary space-time as we know it.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.590
This device would have to do
the same thing.

01:12.070 --> 01:13.970
In other words,
you have no idea what it might be.

01:14.070 --> 01:15.930
Yeah, pretty much. That's it.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.500
Oh, this looks promising.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.180
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

01:45.370 --> 01:49.060
Well, it certainly looks like a place
where Merlin might have lived.

01:49.170 --> 01:50.660
I wouldn't get too excited just yet.

01:50.770 --> 01:54.940
There could be dozens of villages
in the area just like this one.

01:55.980 --> 01:58.340
No way to know for sure
this is the right one.

01:58.450 --> 02:00.470
Well, there's that.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.190
Travelers.

02:19.900 --> 02:23.340
I am Meurik, Governor of this village.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.470
Welcome to Camelot.

03:35.040 --> 03:39.070
These must be the strangers
that everyone is speaking of.

03:39.610 --> 03:43.110
This is Antonius, our village historian.

03:43.220 --> 03:44.690
Welcome to Camelot,

03:44.790 --> 03:48.220
past and future home
of King Arthur and his Round Table.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.850
Sorry? "Future home"?

03:50.960 --> 03:53.790
I assume you know the history
of the Battle of Camlann.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.130
Of course. Where Arthur
was mortally wounded by Mordred.

03:57.230 --> 03:59.600
Arthur? Mortally wounded?

04:01.200 --> 04:02.530
It's ridiculous.

04:02.770 --> 04:05.900
Arthur defeated Mordred
at the Battle of Camlann.

04:06.010 --> 04:10.030
After which he and his fellow knights
set off to find the Sangrail.

04:10.210 --> 04:13.040
-That's the Holy Grail.
-That was long ago.

04:13.150 --> 04:16.740
But we know in our hearts
that one day he will return to us.

04:16.850 --> 04:19.480
What happened to Merlin when he left?

04:26.260 --> 04:29.990
I have matters to attend to.
Best I take my leave now.

04:32.530 --> 04:34.500
Enjoy your stay with us.

04:39.340 --> 04:41.240
Did I offend him?

04:42.210 --> 04:43.580
Not at all.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.840
It's just that

04:47.180 --> 04:50.080
Merlin's name
is rarely mentioned in public.

04:50.550 --> 04:51.920
And why is that?

04:52.050 --> 04:55.390
Well, many believe
he was a wizard of darkness.

04:55.490 --> 04:57.290
He may have tried to do good,

04:57.390 --> 05:01.260
but there was always potential
for great mischief in his heart.

05:02.330 --> 05:07.130
Thankfully, he has neither been seen
nor heard of since Arthur's departure.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.070
The library where he practiced
his strange arts

05:10.170 --> 05:12.230
remains sealed to this day.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.910
-Merlin had a library here?
-Of course.

05:16.340 --> 05:19.250
It was his private sanctuary
here in Camelot.

05:21.550 --> 05:23.410
We'd like to see that.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.750
I'm afraid that's impossible.

05:26.620 --> 05:29.950
The library is protected
by a powerful curse.

05:30.990 --> 05:34.660
It is said that all those
who enter Merlin's sanctuary

05:34.760 --> 05:38.720
forfeit their lives to its guardian,
the Black Knight.

05:50.410 --> 05:53.280
Okay, so best case scenario,
this curse of the Black Knight

05:53.380 --> 05:55.710
is a story Merlin made up
to scare off the locals.

05:55.820 --> 05:59.150
Worse case scenario, he's got another
holographic knight protecting his goods

05:59.250 --> 06:03.020
Iike he did back in England.
Either way, I don't see a big problem.

06:03.420 --> 06:04.390
(GRUNTS)

06:05.590 --> 06:06.650
What?

06:07.700 --> 06:10.600
Given your narrow victory
over the knight in the Avalon cave

06:10.700 --> 06:14.100
it would seem
that your overconfidence is ill-advised.

06:14.270 --> 06:16.200
Did I say anything
about me doing the fighting?

06:16.300 --> 06:19.540
The point is, last time it was a test
designed to measure a challenger's worth.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.910
This time, it sounds more
like a defense mechanism

06:22.010 --> 06:25.240
set up to protect Merlin's research
which means it could be a lot tougher.

06:25.350 --> 06:27.250
And the same rules might not apply.

06:27.350 --> 06:29.580
I think we should split up and look around.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.840
TEAL'C: lndeed.

06:42.330 --> 06:44.390
-Surrender, Mordred!
-Never!

06:46.670 --> 06:48.640
-Yield?
-I yield.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.060
But next time I wanna be Arthur.

06:51.970 --> 06:55.930
Don't know if that's gonna help
if you keep moving around like Ed Grimley.

06:57.010 --> 06:59.070
Here, let me show you something.

07:01.850 --> 07:04.040
You mind? Thank you.

07:04.550 --> 07:07.040
Try not to bob around quite so much.

07:13.630 --> 07:14.690
Nice.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.300
Where did you learn to fight?

07:23.470 --> 07:25.500
Broomstick battles with my kid brother,

07:25.610 --> 07:28.270
and the Sodan ritual of Kel Shak Lo

07:28.380 --> 07:31.470
made me the nimble warrior
that I am today.

07:34.720 --> 07:39.020
So, do either one of you know
where we can find Merlin's...

07:39.120 --> 07:41.490
-Oh, library.
-Merlin's library.

07:58.210 --> 07:59.540
GlRL: This is it.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.610
The door is magicked.

08:09.980 --> 08:11.510
There is a key.

08:12.020 --> 08:13.380
But no one dare use it.

08:13.490 --> 08:17.580
-Where would we find this key?
-lt is kept in the village archives.

08:21.060 --> 08:22.050
No.

08:22.930 --> 08:24.860
Absolutely not.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.190
Antonius.

08:26.930 --> 08:30.670
I will not be party to your deaths.

08:33.570 --> 08:37.340
Your lives would be forfeit
the instant you stepped inside.

08:39.050 --> 08:41.450
We have faced
one of Merlin's knights before.

08:41.550 --> 08:42.520
(SCOFFS)

08:42.720 --> 08:44.010
Impossible.

08:44.390 --> 08:47.180
If you had,
you would not be here to tell the tale.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.450
Well, I am, because we defeated him.

08:49.690 --> 08:51.720
And in defeating him,
we acquired the treasures

08:51.830 --> 08:53.820
he had hidden away on our world.

08:53.930 --> 08:56.760
And one of those treasures
led us here to Camelot.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.460
Antonius, you're the village historian.

08:59.570 --> 09:03.130
Don't tell me you haven't dreamt
about what might be inside there.

09:10.780 --> 09:13.910
ANTONlUS: No one must know
of my participation in this venture.

09:14.020 --> 09:17.280
-MlTCHELL: Got it.
-Not Meurik, not my fellow villagers

09:17.390 --> 09:20.350
and most importantly, not my wife, Livia,

09:20.460 --> 09:25.220
who believes I am reviewing council
minutes with Brother Abelard tonight.

09:25.930 --> 09:27.620
We were never here.

09:56.360 --> 09:57.350
(MITCHELL GROANS)

09:57.460 --> 09:58.650
Spiders.

10:23.650 --> 10:25.850
Yeah, this could take a while.

10:34.660 --> 10:36.190
This is interesting.

10:36.300 --> 10:39.560
This is a reference
to Merlin's prophetic abilities.

10:39.870 --> 10:43.100
There's a similar myth on Earth
that Merlin could see the future

10:43.200 --> 10:45.500
because he actually
aged backwards in time.

10:45.610 --> 10:47.010
It's not meant to be taken literally,

10:47.110 --> 10:48.630
but we have seen
that a lot of legends and folklore

10:48.740 --> 10:50.680
have a strong basis in fact.

10:50.780 --> 10:53.750
-Avalon, Atlantis.
-The Easter Bunny.

10:56.950 --> 10:58.650
I guess there's a few exceptions.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.240
Are you saying that there's
time-travel technology here?

11:01.360 --> 11:03.350
I'm saying there could be anything
around here.

11:03.460 --> 11:07.390
Well, I hate to break it to you folks,
but the only technology I'm seeing

11:07.500 --> 11:10.020
is a bunch of dusty, old books.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.040
And a secret passage.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.410
-All right, there's another chamber.
-We should not go in there.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.810
We've tempted fate enough for one night.

11:33.990 --> 11:36.960
-You can stay up here if you want.
-No.

11:37.390 --> 11:39.220
I shall take my leave.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.160
It's not a puzzle, is it?

12:20.400 --> 12:23.060
No. It's an Ancient control device.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.040
What does it control?

12:26.440 --> 12:27.930
I have no idea.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.300
Livia?

13:05.310 --> 13:07.210
(ANTONIUS SCREAMS)

13:13.690 --> 13:15.850
I've seen this type of interface before.

13:15.960 --> 13:19.520
Activating it is a matter of
correctly interpreting these symbols.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.560
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

13:30.040 --> 13:31.530
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

13:41.080 --> 13:42.380
He's dead.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.190
How do you explain this?

13:58.400 --> 14:02.300
Antonius had it with him
when he was killed.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.340
Meurik, we're very sorry
about what happened...

14:04.440 --> 14:06.630
You went into the wizard's library,
didn't you?

14:06.740 --> 14:07.730
Yes, we did.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.830
Look, it wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

14:09.940 --> 14:11.410
We figured if the knight was gonna appear

14:11.510 --> 14:14.000
it'd be in the chamber
and he wouldn't go after anybody but us.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.610
You were warned of the danger,
and you refused to believe.

14:17.820 --> 14:19.680
You awakened the curse.

14:19.850 --> 14:22.290
The Black Knight is not part of any curse.

14:22.390 --> 14:24.790
He isn't magical, and he isn't unbeatable.

14:24.860 --> 14:27.450
Your world as well as countless others
are in danger

14:27.560 --> 14:31.830
of being overrun by an enemy far more
powerful than you could ever imagine.

14:31.930 --> 14:33.460
They are called the Ori.

14:33.570 --> 14:36.730
And they will destroy anyone
who does not kneel before them.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.860
We learned that a long time ago
Merlin was working on a weapon

14:38.970 --> 14:40.100
that could be used against them,

14:40.210 --> 14:43.010
and the key to finding that weapon
is inside that library.

14:43.110 --> 14:46.600
I have never seen nor heard of these Ori.

14:47.380 --> 14:50.650
But we have witnessed
the power of the Black Knight.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.550
Leave this village.

14:56.090 --> 14:57.850
Take the curse with you.

15:06.930 --> 15:09.200
Well, we can't just give up.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.330
Daniel, we're not exactly welcome here
anymore.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.670
Don't you see
this is exactly what Merlin wanted?

15:14.780 --> 15:16.330
Why do you think
he designed the Black Knight

15:16.440 --> 15:18.740
to attack in the village
and not the chamber?

15:18.850 --> 15:20.210
To incite terror.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.310
I mean, if he just killed
whoever was inside the chamber

15:22.420 --> 15:24.580
then there would be no great
public incentive to keep people out.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.740
You go in at your own risk
and there'd always be someone

15:26.850 --> 15:28.340
foolish enough to give it a try.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.150
Yeah. Someone like us.

15:30.260 --> 15:32.660
But the point is, he designed it that way
because he was worried

15:32.760 --> 15:34.250
that someone might stumble
onto the solution,

15:34.360 --> 15:36.730
which means there is a solution
and it's inside that chamber.

15:36.830 --> 15:38.700
-A shut-off switch.
-Exactly.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.200
Well, that's great.
But how does it help us now?

15:42.800 --> 15:44.240
I don't know.

15:44.770 --> 15:47.170
Just give me a little time
to talk to these people.

15:47.270 --> 15:49.830
If I can get some of them on our side,

15:49.940 --> 15:52.440
we might be able to get Meurik
to reconsider.

16:07.490 --> 16:09.890
GlRL: Only he who is pure of heart
and true of spirit,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.230
can pull the sword from the stone.

16:12.900 --> 16:15.100
They said Arthur
will not return from his quest

16:15.200 --> 16:17.670
until one among us
succeeds in removing it.

16:18.210 --> 16:21.110
-You ever try it?
-Of course not.

16:21.780 --> 16:23.770
It is for the young men
who are preparing to be knights

16:23.880 --> 16:25.610
to test themselves with the sword.

16:25.710 --> 16:28.080
As my brother Ramus will do,
when he comes of age.

16:28.180 --> 16:32.020
Yeah, but I've seen you spar.
You've got skills.

16:33.050 --> 16:35.320
I only do that to help Ramus train.

16:35.460 --> 16:39.120
When Arthur does come back, he will need
knights to join him on his next crusade.

16:39.230 --> 16:41.490
The men of this village
will be ready to serve him.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.690
And you're not interested in that.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.460
MEURlK: Valencia!

16:45.570 --> 16:47.560
-Leave us.
-Yes, Governor.

16:47.670 --> 16:50.260
You abuse my tolerant nature, Colonel.

16:53.010 --> 16:56.600
-I take it it didn't go so well.
-JACKSON: Not really.

16:56.910 --> 17:00.040
These men will escort you
to the Great Ring,

17:00.150 --> 17:02.410
and ensure that you leave, as requested.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.640
Okay, you're making a mistake,
there is no curse.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.080
Now, the Black Knight
is a security feature created by Merlin

17:07.190 --> 17:08.880
through the use of science
and advanced technology.

17:08.990 --> 17:10.420
There is no magic...

17:22.870 --> 17:25.000
SG-1, welcome aboard the Odyssey.

17:25.110 --> 17:28.670
-Colonel, what's going on?
-Change of plans.

17:30.680 --> 17:35.550
We received a subspace transmission
from a Jaffa vessel near P3Y-229.

17:35.650 --> 17:38.170
They were investigating
some unusual energy readings.

17:38.290 --> 17:39.950
This is what they found.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.750
And we enhanced the image.

17:45.990 --> 17:48.050
A fully formed supergate.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.660
Stargate Command tried to dial 229,
but couldn't get a lock.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.600
Planet was probably destroyed
in the formation of the microsingularity.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.900
My orders were to pick you up,
proceed immediately to the supergate.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.370
Unfortunately, Daedalus
is still in the Pegasus Galaxy,

18:00.470 --> 18:02.810
but the Korolevwill be joining us
as soon as possible.

18:02.910 --> 18:06.140
-I didn't think it was operational yet.
-It's been rushed into service.

18:06.250 --> 18:09.270
We're to meet up with as many Jaffa
and Tok'ra ships as we can muster.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.350
And destroy that thing
by whatever means necessary.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.280
-Set a course.
-MlTCHELL: Yes, sir.

18:14.390 --> 18:19.120
-Wait a minute. We can't go yet.
-We don't have anymore time, Doctor.

18:19.230 --> 18:21.350
By all indications
that spacegate's operational.

18:21.460 --> 18:24.020
There's no telling when the Ori
are gonna start sending ships through.

18:24.130 --> 18:26.530
Okay, go, but leave me behind.

18:27.400 --> 18:31.500
Colonel, I believe the key to defeating
the Ori is on that planet. I know it.

18:31.610 --> 18:35.010
Daniel, even if you're right, the villagers
are never gonna let you back in the library.

18:35.110 --> 18:36.670
Then beam me in.

18:39.650 --> 18:41.840
All right, you get one more chance.

18:41.950 --> 18:44.920
I'll go with Jackson. Little quality time.

18:45.990 --> 18:47.950
And that Black Knight
might show up again.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.390
We'll have the Russians swing by
and pick you up on the way through.

18:50.490 --> 18:52.860
-You'll have until then.
-Thank you, sir.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.670
So, what now?

19:06.940 --> 19:09.430
Well, all indications are
the Black Knight was activated

19:09.540 --> 19:11.340
the second I stepped onto that platform.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.910
So, my guess is we can shut him down

19:14.010 --> 19:17.680
by inputting the correct code sequence
on that control panel.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.910
-Merlin's PlN number?
-Yeah, something like that.

19:22.220 --> 19:23.780
So how do we find it?

19:24.190 --> 19:27.060
By analyzing these documents.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.860
You do realize we're on the clock, right?

19:34.640 --> 19:37.430
-The course is plotted, sir.
-Very well.

19:37.540 --> 19:41.740
Colonel Emerson, I wish to be transferred
to the nearest Jaffa-controlled vessel.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.070
Can I ask why?

19:43.180 --> 19:46.080
I intend to seek out
some much needed allies.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.890
That's it.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.960
Sorry. Didn't mean to wake you.

20:08.170 --> 20:10.330
No, I wasn't sleeping.

20:11.570 --> 20:13.200
I was kelno'reeming.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.570
Teal'c taught me the fundamentals.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.870
Did he mention you should remain
conscious in the process?

20:19.150 --> 20:21.740
Yeah, I'm still working on the basics.

20:22.380 --> 20:25.820
So, you got something?

20:25.920 --> 20:29.220
Yeah, I've cross-referenced half a dozen
passages that mention the Black Knight,

20:29.320 --> 20:32.820
now there's a series of recurring words
and phrases that stand out

20:32.930 --> 20:36.760
-if you know what you're looking for.
-Are we talking access code?

20:36.860 --> 20:38.460
I think so.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.080
What's the matter?

20:53.250 --> 20:55.550
Well, if I'm wrong about this, then...

20:55.650 --> 21:00.210
-Look, I'll take care of the Black Knight.
-Yeah, how are you gonna do that again?

21:00.520 --> 21:03.390
I will pull the sword
from the stone just like last time.

21:03.490 --> 21:06.790
Well, I think we've been over this.
This is a completely different scenario.

21:06.890 --> 21:09.160
See, in the Avalon cave,
it was pulling the sword from the stone

21:09.260 --> 21:11.230
that caused the knight
to appear in the first place.

21:11.330 --> 21:13.930
Here, we don't even know
if they're connected.

21:14.130 --> 21:15.930
We know Merlin
put the sword there, right?

21:16.040 --> 21:17.030
Probably.

21:17.140 --> 21:20.660
Which means it's no ordinary sword,
and that's good enough for me.

21:20.770 --> 21:23.440
-Besides, do we have a choice?
-No.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.410
-What?
-Nothing happened.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.640
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

21:59.750 --> 22:01.040
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

22:01.150 --> 22:02.480
-Bad.
-Bad.

22:03.020 --> 22:07.250
-You stay. I'll go. Make it work!
-Okay.

Oh, boy.

22:19.700 --> 22:21.260
Everybody, down!

22:28.110 --> 22:29.840
No. Didn't think so.

(GROANS)

22:49.460 --> 22:52.690
-Mitchell, how's it going out there?
-Not so good.

23:03.610 --> 23:05.480
Do something. Help him.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.150
He brought this on himself.

23:25.130 --> 23:27.100
What do you think you're doing?

24:09.710 --> 24:12.800
Greetings, friend. I am Merlin.

24:13.210 --> 24:14.700
Yes, you are.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.940
The prize you seek,
like the pendulum's swing,

24:18.050 --> 24:21.280
marks the passage
of all that is before you.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.060
-Mitchell, I did it.
-Greetings...

24:24.160 --> 24:27.150
-ls the Black Knight gone?
-Not exactly!

24:31.600 --> 24:34.160
I don't understand. I got the treasure,
I activated the hologram.

24:34.270 --> 24:35.230
Greetings...

24:39.210 --> 24:40.540
Try a different code!

24:40.640 --> 24:43.130
I already tried all the combinations
I came up with!

24:43.240 --> 24:44.940
...marks the passage
of all that is before you.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.310
Mitchell?

24:46.980 --> 24:48.110
Mitchell!

24:48.220 --> 24:50.780
Greetings, friend. I am Merlin.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.920
...all that is before you.

25:00.430 --> 25:03.490
Greetings, friend. I am Merlin.

25:03.930 --> 25:07.160
The prize you seek,
like the pendulum's swing,

25:07.270 --> 25:10.240
marks the passage
of all that is before you.

25:10.370 --> 25:13.030
-Greetings, friend...
-Oh, screw it.

25:20.350 --> 25:22.650
-Look! Where did it go?
-Look!

(ALL APPLAUDING)

26:06.060 --> 26:09.220
Sir, we're receiving a transmission
from one of the Jaffa ships.

26:09.330 --> 26:10.960
Put it on screen.

26:12.100 --> 26:14.590
I am Cha 'ra of the Free Jaffa.

26:14.700 --> 26:17.070
It was my ship that discovered the gate.

26:17.170 --> 26:19.430
I understand there's been
no other signs of activity.

26:19.540 --> 26:20.560
None.

26:20.670 --> 26:23.800
You should be aware we've already
attempted to destroy the gate.

26:23.910 --> 26:26.310
Our combined forces had no effect.

26:34.190 --> 26:37.490
So all you had to do
was shoot the control crystal?

26:37.860 --> 26:40.950
-Pretty much.
-Sounds like one of my plans.

26:41.060 --> 26:43.390
How come you didn't do that
in the first place?

26:43.500 --> 26:46.160
Well, because I had to find
the access code first.

26:46.270 --> 26:48.890
If I hadn't, none of this
would've beamed in

26:49.000 --> 26:51.370
and I wouldn't have seen
Merlin's hologram message.

26:51.470 --> 26:53.270
Right. What did he say?

26:53.370 --> 26:57.810
Well, I think it was a riddle,
and I believe I've figured it out.

26:59.510 --> 27:01.410
You see this pendant?

27:01.520 --> 27:04.850
Now, in every depiction of Merlin
from his library, I've seen it,

27:04.950 --> 27:07.180
and, in fact, in the hologram message
he was wearing it as well.

27:07.290 --> 27:11.310
But I've never seen it before, not in
any reference material back on Earth.

27:11.590 --> 27:14.150
And you think
that's the device we're looking for?

27:14.260 --> 27:17.060
The riddle mentions a pendulum.
Now at first I thought that was a reference

27:17.160 --> 27:19.220
to a passage of time
like a pendulum clock,

27:19.330 --> 27:22.200
then I realized it was more literal,
something that hangs.

27:22.300 --> 27:25.000
It also said, it was right before my eyes.

27:28.010 --> 27:30.910
I don't know.
Doesn't that seem a little small?

27:31.010 --> 27:34.000
Just remember we're talking about things
that transcend ordinary space-time here.

27:34.110 --> 27:35.980
Relative size has no meaning.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.810
Fine, let's start looking.

27:43.190 --> 27:45.850
Sir, another ship
just dropped out of hyperspace.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.620
-It's an Asgard vessel.
-Open a channel.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.430
This is Colonel Emerson
of the Earth vessel Odyssey.

27:54.230 --> 27:56.430
Yes, I know who you are.

27:57.070 --> 27:59.370
-Hello, Kvasir.
-Colonel Carter.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.600
There is much work to be done.

28:01.710 --> 28:03.470
Where is the rest of your team?

28:03.580 --> 28:06.240
Daniel and Colonel Mitchell
are still looking for the Ancient device

28:06.350 --> 28:08.250
I was telling you about
in our communiqué.

28:08.350 --> 28:09.780
And Teal'c...

28:12.350 --> 28:15.290
Well, we're not exactly sure
where Teal'c is.

28:37.910 --> 28:42.210
Flying into our territory
in an unmarked cargo ship.

28:44.620 --> 28:46.590
I didn't think you were that stupid.

28:46.690 --> 28:48.590
I have allowed myself to be captured

28:48.690 --> 28:51.780
knowing that I would
be brought before you.

28:51.890 --> 28:53.090
Really?

28:53.660 --> 28:57.030
I have come to seek the assistance
of the Lucian Alliance.

28:57.260 --> 28:58.960
I take it back.

28:59.630 --> 29:01.260
You're not stupid.

29:02.100 --> 29:04.660
You're insane. Kill him.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.780
I should kill you where you stand.

29:21.450 --> 29:23.150
But as I have said,

29:24.690 --> 29:27.180
I have come seeking your assistance.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.830
The fate of the galaxy is at stake.

29:38.240 --> 29:42.540
We have been analyzing the information
that Daniel Jackson was able to retrieve

29:42.640 --> 29:44.580
from Merlin's phase-shifting device.

29:44.680 --> 29:48.410
Unfortunately, he didn't get very far
before it permanently ran out of power.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.610
There was enough data for us to surmise

29:50.720 --> 29:53.480
what the so called
anti-Ori weapon might be.

29:53.590 --> 29:57.020
Really?
I wasn't able to make heads or tails of it.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.320
Really?

29:59.230 --> 30:01.190
Just tell me what you got.

30:01.290 --> 30:05.230
It is an energy-transfer device
similar to a zero point module,

30:05.330 --> 30:07.300
except that the energy is channeled

30:07.400 --> 30:10.060
not from subspace
into ordinary space-time,

30:10.170 --> 30:13.630
but rather, into the dimension
occupied by ascended beings.

30:13.740 --> 30:16.110
And this energy is harmful to them
in some way?

30:16.210 --> 30:17.940
It is a form of interference.

30:18.040 --> 30:22.480
A simple analogy would be two
standing waves canceling each other out.

30:22.580 --> 30:25.880
If the weapon indeed works
the way Merlin's writings imply,

30:25.990 --> 30:29.720
we would simply need to activate it
and send it to the Ori galaxy.

30:29.820 --> 30:32.990
-And they would be eliminated.
-Yeah, but how do we do that?

30:33.090 --> 30:35.220
I mean, we don't even know
where the Ori galaxy is,

30:35.330 --> 30:37.630
Iet alone have the ability
to send something there.

30:37.730 --> 30:39.930
That is where you're mistaken.

30:41.630 --> 30:43.730
You're talking about the supergate.

30:44.270 --> 30:46.360
We dial out before they can dial in.

30:46.470 --> 30:47.940
Precisely.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.970
That might actually work.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.340
Of course, we will need Merlin's weapon.

30:52.450 --> 30:55.070
If Colonel Mitchell
and Dr. Jackson don't find it...

30:55.180 --> 30:57.380
Don't worry, they'll find it.

31:01.150 --> 31:03.250
What do you mean, "It's not here"?

31:03.520 --> 31:06.250
We've been through this stuff twice.
It's not here.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.220
It's got to be here!

31:08.330 --> 31:12.360
Look, I once lost my car keys
in my apartment for three days...

31:12.470 --> 31:13.800
MEURlK: Colonel Mitchell?

31:16.040 --> 31:18.900
Hi. Come on in.

31:19.810 --> 31:23.110
Don't be afraid.
The Black Knight's not coming back.

31:29.150 --> 31:32.980
-It's incredible.
-Yeah. It's all yours.

31:34.490 --> 31:37.950
You do not wish to claim a prize
for defeating Merlin's champion?

31:38.060 --> 31:41.790
There was one thing we were looking for,
but we can't find it.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.190
Actually, maybe you can help us.

31:53.340 --> 31:55.360
Do you recognize this?

31:58.880 --> 32:00.610
It is the Sangrail.

32:01.610 --> 32:03.580
This is the Sangrail?

32:03.980 --> 32:06.450
It is also known as the bloodstone.

32:06.620 --> 32:10.180
Of course, "sang. "Blood.
Blood-red, for the color of the jewel.

32:10.520 --> 32:13.520
Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute,
we're talking about the Holy Grail, right?

32:13.630 --> 32:15.390
Every movie I've seen, that's a cup.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.730
No, the notion that the Grail
was a cup or chalice,

32:18.830 --> 32:20.800
particularly the one used by Christ
at the Last Supper,

32:20.900 --> 32:22.370
was a late addition to the myth.

32:22.470 --> 32:25.300
See, there were accounts describing it
variously as a dish or platter,

32:25.410 --> 32:26.670
or in the case of von Eschenbach,

32:26.770 --> 32:28.540
and other Middle Eastern-influenced
chroniclers

32:28.640 --> 32:30.910
as a stone that fell from the heavens.

32:31.510 --> 32:35.970
If this is what you seek
you won't find it among these trinkets.

32:36.420 --> 32:40.580
Arthur and his knights
left to quest for the Sangrail long ago.

32:42.190 --> 32:44.880
-Do you know where they went?
-Of course.

32:45.730 --> 32:49.390
It is said that they journeyed
to three distant lands

32:49.500 --> 32:55.330
mentioned in Merlin's prophecy,
Castiana, Sahal and Vagonbrei.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.600
-Any of those spots ring a bell?
-No.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.400
But if they were part
of one of Merlin's prophecies,

33:00.510 --> 33:03.130
then any one of his books could
hold the key to what we're looking for.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.680
The books upstairs?

33:04.780 --> 33:07.270
Jackson, that's days, weeks,
to find the proper reference.

33:07.380 --> 33:10.180
And then there's no guarantee that
we're gonna be able to track them down.

33:10.280 --> 33:14.580
Searching for Arthur's whereabouts
in this library is not necessary.

33:14.690 --> 33:15.680
Now,

33:16.860 --> 33:21.160
thanks to Valencia, we've been given
a sign that Arthur will return soon

33:21.260 --> 33:24.360
and you are welcome to stay with us
and wait.

33:24.460 --> 33:30.200
As the men that conquered Merlin's curse
you will be given a place of honor.

33:30.870 --> 33:34.900
Look, once and for all,
there was no curse, okay?

33:35.010 --> 33:38.340
This... This is a device, it's a machine.

33:38.440 --> 33:42.940
It's like a flour mill or a catapult.
It's just a lot more complicated.

33:43.050 --> 33:44.610
There is no magic...

33:46.690 --> 33:47.950
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

33:54.060 --> 33:55.930
Boy, my timing's off today!

33:56.030 --> 33:59.620
Colonel Mitchell, Dr. Jackson,
welcome aboard the Korolev.

34:06.070 --> 34:07.440
There it is.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.980
-Colonel Carter.
-Sir.

34:12.310 --> 34:14.510
We've managed to locate
the dialing-control crystals

34:14.610 --> 34:16.410
on one particular section of the gate.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.780
Kvasir has already programmed
a replacement crystal,

34:18.890 --> 34:21.650
so it's just a matter of somebody
getting out there and installing it.

34:21.750 --> 34:23.920
And I suppose you'd like to volunteer.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.150
-Yes, sir.
-I would go,

34:26.260 --> 34:29.590
but you do not have a space suit
that would fit me.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.290
No one's going.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.890
We just got word from the Korolev.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.160
Mitchell and Jackson
didn't find the device.

34:37.270 --> 34:40.570
Sir, even without Merlin's device,
dialing out is still our best bet,

34:40.670 --> 34:43.670
because in the very least
it will prevent them from dialing in.

34:43.780 --> 34:46.800
Well, it's possible that with
the power generated by the singularity

34:46.910 --> 34:49.510
we can maintain
this connection indefinitely.

35:10.470 --> 35:12.230
The coordinates are set.

35:13.510 --> 35:16.940
-Are you ready, Colonel Carter?
-Ready as I'll ever be.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.350
Initiating transport.

35:37.660 --> 35:39.530
Engaging magnetic lock.

35:55.650 --> 35:57.710
I'm removing the panel now.

36:12.100 --> 36:14.570
I'm putting in our control crystal.

36:28.750 --> 36:31.010
It'll just take a few minutes to initialize.

36:34.890 --> 36:38.650
Sir, we're picking up increased
energy output coming from the gate.

36:39.390 --> 36:40.360
(ELECTRICAL BUZZING)

36:43.100 --> 36:44.930
Something's happening.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.060
I've lost my magnetic lock!

36:51.700 --> 36:53.540
It's an incoming wormhole.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.210
Get her out of there, now.

36:56.310 --> 36:59.040
It's not working.
There's too much interference.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.770
Sam, report.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.370
Sam.

37:20.430 --> 37:21.760
Oh, my God.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.170
Can you re-acquire Colonel Carter's signal?

37:28.270 --> 37:31.040
Negative.
She's too close to the event horizon.

37:40.890 --> 37:43.360
Sir, the Korolevjust dropped
out of hyperspace.

37:43.460 --> 37:44.480
This is Colonel Chekov.

37:44.590 --> 37:45.820
What is the situation?

37:45.930 --> 37:47.390
EMERSON:
We've got an incoming wormhole.

37:47.490 --> 37:49.550
I suggest you prepare for battle.

37:49.660 --> 37:51.960
(GIVING ORDERS IN RUSSIAN)

37:54.130 --> 37:55.400
Here they come.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.960
-I only count four ships.
-It's probably their first wave.

38:28.370 --> 38:31.700
We should see what we can do
about discouraging a second one.

38:31.800 --> 38:32.770
(GIVING ORDERS IN RUSSIAN)

38:37.410 --> 38:40.540
Sir, we're receiving a message
from one of the Ori ships.

38:40.650 --> 38:42.170
Text only.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.040
What does it say?

38:44.150 --> 38:47.550
"And those who are prideful
and refuse to bow down

38:47.650 --> 38:50.420
"shall be laid low and made unto dust."

38:52.990 --> 38:54.480
Is that all it says?

38:54.590 --> 38:56.650
-Yeah, that's it.
-Open a channel.

38:56.760 --> 38:57.730
(SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN)

39:02.440 --> 39:05.230
"Then to Tyolus,
say to the people of the low plains,

39:05.340 --> 39:07.270
"seek not the wickedness
amongst your neighbors

39:07.370 --> 39:10.040
"lest it find purchase in your own house."

39:12.580 --> 39:14.840
-What was that?
-Book of Origin.

39:15.050 --> 39:16.670
Think it'll help?

39:21.250 --> 39:23.380
They're powering up their weapons, sir.

39:23.560 --> 39:26.250
Here we go. All batteries, open fire.

39:49.180 --> 39:51.980
(ALL SHOUTING)

39:59.360 --> 40:00.790
Shield's down to 50%.

40:07.330 --> 40:09.430
Sir, we just lost sublight engines.

40:17.180 --> 40:20.440
Redirect power to the engines.
Begin evasive maneuvers.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.310
CHEKOV: We've lost power.

40:24.880 --> 40:28.650
-We have to scramble the 3R-2's.
-No. They'll have no effect against that.

40:28.750 --> 40:31.810
Hey! We're getting our asses kicked,
it's time to go all in!

40:31.920 --> 40:35.090
I'll draw their fire
while you get the ship back online!

40:37.700 --> 40:40.190
It's no good, sir. We're dead in the water.

40:41.430 --> 40:43.300
Sir, picking up approaching ships.

40:50.640 --> 40:53.040
Apologies for my Iate arrival.

40:53.150 --> 40:54.770
Better late than never.

40:54.880 --> 40:56.040
Indeed.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.010
Forget the engines!

40:58.120 --> 40:59.410
Give them everything we've got!
