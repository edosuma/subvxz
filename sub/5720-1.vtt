00:04.439 --> 00:06.795
_

00:08.583 --> 00:10.034
_

00:12.201 --> 00:14.300
- Good game, Mr. Vice President.
- Sir, how is it going...

00:14.301 --> 00:15.822
Hello, good to see you.

00:15.823 --> 00:19.447
Gentleman, glad we could provide
a perfect day for golf.

00:19.448 --> 00:22.699
The least we could do, seeing as you
are stuck with the under-study.

00:23.393 --> 00:27.844
The President is very sorry to miss
out on the Pacific Rim Economic Forum

00:27.845 --> 00:30.721
but, he and Prime Minister Welton
shared a close friendship.

00:30.722 --> 00:35.031
Of course, he had to be on hand for the state
funeral and is just flying home today.

00:35.385 --> 00:39.554
Our hearts go out to our Australian brothers
and sisters on this solemn occasion.

00:39.560 --> 00:44.000
The good news for all of you is that
Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership

00:44.001 --> 00:45.957
has been high on my agenda
since I was a young Senator.

00:45.958 --> 00:50.582
The bad news for all of you: I'm a
much better golfer than the President.

00:51.951 --> 00:54.388
Minister Chen, I believe you
are in the first group?

00:58.058 --> 01:00.842
We're assuming this is
why Australia did not

01:00.843 --> 01:03.092
send a delegate to the
conference this year.

01:03.157 --> 01:05.808
They are a county in mourning,
rather than protest.

01:05.809 --> 01:06.674
Absolutely.

01:06.675 --> 01:10.497
Because we are well aware that some of our
members of the Asian-Pacific nations are

01:10.498 --> 01:14.103
not entirely comfortable with the inclusion
of China at this forum this year.

01:14.104 --> 01:17.823
On the contrary, Minister Chen,
we need China in this discussion.

01:17.826 --> 01:20.882
Given that much of the framework
is about counterfeit issues.

01:20.985 --> 01:24.185
We a... want to see some progress there.

01:24.439 --> 01:25.958
It's a little warm today isn't it?

01:25.959 --> 01:28.780
It's quite pleasant.

01:28.804 --> 01:30.549
Warm to me.

01:30.550 --> 01:33.241
I usually run cool.

01:33.606 --> 01:35.610
Our we speaking in metaphors?

01:35.693 --> 01:38.284
Ahh... what?

01:38.285 --> 01:41.210
If that is the case, Mr.
Vice President, let

01:41.211 --> 01:44.312
me remind you that a
fish rots from the head.

01:44.579 --> 01:45.559
Please, don't say that.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.528
I thought you had this idiom:
the fish rots from the head?

01:48.529 --> 01:50.929
- Please.
- Just as the top part of the fish rots...

01:50.930 --> 01:51.937
(throws up)

01:54.195 --> 01:55.893
- I'm so sorry.
- We need medical...

01:55.894 --> 01:57.212
There's something wrong...

01:57.213 --> 01:58.536
(groans)

01:58.956 --> 02:02.484
♪ We haven't done that in a longest time ♪

02:02.485 --> 02:05.990
♪ Once, I thought that our
free-trade was gone ♪

02:05.991 --> 02:10.243
♪ Whoo-ee-oooh. Now, I know

♪ Ahhh. So, grab your iPhone. But

02:27.441 --> 02:28.602
♪ For the longest time ♪

02:30.917 --> 02:32.866
That's as far as I got.

02:34.767 --> 02:35.998
Madam Secretary?

02:35.999 --> 02:39.633
I'm so sorry. I was hoping this
was the part where I wake up.

02:39.634 --> 02:43.114
It's the first draft and you know it
will sound a lot better when you do it.

02:43.115 --> 02:44.432
- Mmm.
- Of course, you'll have some of the staff

02:44.433 --> 02:46.079
- backing you up.
- I know it's cheesy.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.232
But the Pacific Rim
Economic Forum is important

02:49.233 --> 02:50.990
and the delegates love
the talent show aspect.

02:50.991 --> 02:53.413
The hosting country always performs.

02:53.613 --> 02:55.695
Look it would be bad form to skip it.

02:55.696 --> 02:57.340
And it really comes down to the Cambodians.

02:57.341 --> 02:59.796
They're the swing vote on
the Trans-Pacific agreement

02:59.797 --> 03:02.054
and they are huge fans of Billy Joel.

03:02.055 --> 03:05.159
Oh... that's good... here's the thing.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.410
I don't sing.

03:06.958 --> 03:09.518
I mean a little bit in the shower,
you know, here and there.

03:09.567 --> 03:11.412
Do you guys sing?

03:12.139 --> 03:13.669
Yeah... I do.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.057
College, acapela.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.194
Resume builder.

03:20.195 --> 03:22.994
Madam Secretary. The whole
thing is ludicrous.

03:22.995 --> 03:27.761
But it has a lot more diplomatic
importance that you might think.

03:28.177 --> 03:30.163
(sighs) Just...

03:30.396 --> 03:33.167
tell me I have time in my
schedule to work on this.

03:33.168 --> 03:34.400
Oh, no ma'am.

03:35.128 --> 03:37.949
But, I'm certain Daisy has a plan.

03:39.082 --> 03:41.181
I'm sure you're better than you think.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.271
That's your plan?

03:43.332 --> 03:46.962
Well, she's right. If you
can speak you can sing.

03:47.638 --> 03:49.505
Unless, you're tone deaf or something.

03:50.692 --> 03:53.277
I'm sure you're not. That's like
2 percent of the population.

03:53.278 --> 03:56.857
Excuse me, ma'am, the Vice President
has been taken to the hospital.

03:56.858 --> 04:00.522
Following an incident on the golf
course with the Pan-Asian delegation.

04:00.528 --> 04:03.648
Flu-like symptoms. He'll
be under going tests.

04:03.649 --> 04:06.379
His condition is stable and
they'll keep us informed.

04:09.665 --> 04:11.693
Flu-like symptoms?

04:11.996 --> 04:13.723
That sounds contagious.

04:13.724 --> 04:15.670
Madam Secretary, you're
going to be great.

04:16.594 --> 04:20.704
E.M Forster said if I had to choose
between betraying my friend or my country.

04:20.706 --> 04:24.638
I hope I would have the
courage to betray my country.

04:25.256 --> 04:27.220
Anybody want to expand on that?

04:28.465 --> 04:33.645
It demonstrates his distrust...
of larger institutions.

04:33.646 --> 04:34.547
As an outsider.

04:34.548 --> 04:35.328
How an outsider?

04:35.329 --> 04:37.473
Gay, in England at the turn of the century?

04:37.474 --> 04:40.170
Okay, so you're suggesting
that his outsider status

04:40.171 --> 04:42.295
gave him a unique perspective

04:42.296 --> 04:44.523
on nationalism, but does this statement

04:45.191 --> 04:46.591
- make him unpatriotic?
- Yes.

04:46.592 --> 04:48.694
- Why?
- The point

04:48.695 --> 04:50.295
of serving your country is,

04:50.296 --> 04:52.097
you put the greater good
ahead of the individual.

04:52.098 --> 04:53.465
Okay, Ivan.

04:53.466 --> 04:57.769
Okay, but what about fighting
for your buddy in the foxhole?

04:57.770 --> 05:00.038
I feel like that might be more
of an American concept.

05:00.039 --> 05:01.306
Well, I-I disagree.

05:01.307 --> 05:03.041
All of those soldiers fighting shoeless

05:03.042 --> 05:04.810
and without weapons on the Russian front

05:04.811 --> 05:05.977
in World War II

05:05.978 --> 05:08.046
were not serving the common good.

05:08.047 --> 05:09.247
They were being forced

05:09.248 --> 05:11.216
- into the battle, and they did it...
- (phone buzzing)

05:11.217 --> 05:13.752
...to keep themselves and their
families from going to prison.

05:13.753 --> 05:15.520
IVAN: That's an oversimplification,

05:15.521 --> 05:18.857
and you can't reduce
Russian patriotism to that.

05:18.858 --> 05:21.827
It took real idealism to defeat Hitler. _

05:21.828 --> 05:25.430
And the Russian Army
almost accomplished that

05:25.431 --> 05:27.265
single-handedly.

05:27.266 --> 05:30.569
(loud, overlapping chatter)

05:30.570 --> 05:33.839
All right. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.974
- (whistles)
- Reign it in. Reign it in.

05:35.975 --> 05:39.311
Uh, who won World War II is
an entirely different class,

05:39.312 --> 05:40.846
and I don't teach it, thank God.

05:40.847 --> 05:42.881
Uh, so let's talk for a minute

05:42.882 --> 05:47.051
about the ethical role of the
individual in a commonwealth.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.827
Sorry to call you in
on such short notice.

05:55.828 --> 05:57.562
We like to give more
of a heads-up as a rule.

05:57.563 --> 06:00.265
I'm Jane Fellows. I'll be
your you main contact at DIA.

06:00.266 --> 06:03.602
This is Cooper Ralston, Perry Thomas.

06:03.603 --> 06:04.903
- Hi.
- How are you?

06:04.904 --> 06:07.338
- Hello.
- Have a seat.

06:09.608 --> 06:12.411
This is one of our safe houses.

06:12.412 --> 06:14.012
It's smarter for you not
to come to the office.

06:14.013 --> 06:16.915
Uh, you look a little thrown.

06:16.916 --> 06:18.350
I was told General Sarno briefed you

06:18.351 --> 06:19.951
on how this would work once you joined

06:19.952 --> 06:21.353
the faculty at the War College.

06:21.354 --> 06:22.721
I was informed

06:22.722 --> 06:25.357
there'd be some overlap
with DIA, but that's it.

06:25.358 --> 06:27.392
Occupational hazard, being
stingy with information.

06:27.393 --> 06:29.795
I'm sorry about that.

06:29.796 --> 06:31.830
Uh, getting right to the point,

06:31.831 --> 06:34.132
we have an eye on one of your students.

06:34.133 --> 06:36.001
Ivan Kolashkov. Do you know him?

06:36.002 --> 06:38.670
Yes, of course. He's in
my Military Ethics class.

06:38.671 --> 06:40.872
He's training to serve
under General Doroshevich,

06:40.873 --> 06:43.175
one of the highest-ranking
members of the Russian military,

06:43.176 --> 06:45.143
and a close advisor to President Ostrov.

06:45.144 --> 06:47.512
I believe that all the Russian students

06:47.513 --> 06:49.815
in my classes are under his direction.

06:49.816 --> 06:53.751
Yes. But we like Ivan.

06:54.553 --> 06:56.855
He seems pretty steadfast
in his nationalism.

06:56.856 --> 06:58.256
Good.

06:58.257 --> 07:00.826
Observe and assess him. We need a basic

07:00.827 --> 07:03.495
psychological profile, character analysis.

07:03.496 --> 07:05.063
What are you looking for?

07:05.064 --> 07:08.133
To see whether or not he
can be an asset for us.

07:08.134 --> 07:11.602
We feel we could redirect
all that fiery patriotism.

07:14.706 --> 07:17.976
Do you want to let me in on the idea?

07:17.977 --> 07:19.444
He's a closet homosexual.

07:19.445 --> 07:21.313
Russian Military takes a dim view of it.

07:21.314 --> 07:23.782
Mean the end of his career,
possible prison time.

07:23.783 --> 07:26.084
What do you need me for?

07:26.085 --> 07:27.519
There are other criteria to consider.

07:27.520 --> 07:28.653
Uh, you're familiar

07:28.654 --> 07:31.056
with the checklist of
intelligence modalities?

07:31.057 --> 07:35.894
Inter and intra personal skills,
situational awareness, so on?

07:35.895 --> 07:40.465
So, you want me to tee him
up so you can blackmail him?

07:40.466 --> 07:44.068
All while teaching Military Ethics.

07:45.003 --> 07:47.604
(sighs)

07:49.107 --> 07:53.078
National security is a vast network,

07:53.079 --> 07:55.714
and it's all part of the
same fabric, Dr. McCord,

07:55.715 --> 07:58.183
but... you know that.

07:58.184 --> 08:00.652
It's a corrupt government which
forces him into the shadows.

08:00.653 --> 08:02.621
Let's start there, or maybe

08:02.622 --> 08:04.689
you're squeamish because
you're still new at this

08:04.690 --> 08:06.691
and thinking about the person,
and not the politics.

08:06.692 --> 08:10.061
But Russia continues to be
our next real nuclear threat,

08:10.062 --> 08:12.831
and he's a very ambitious
officer in their army.

08:12.832 --> 08:16.501
No matter how cuddly he
might seem in your classroom.

08:16.502 --> 08:19.503
Perry, is it?

08:20.639 --> 08:23.540
I think it's best we don't talk.

08:26.344 --> 08:28.613
(sighs)

08:28.614 --> 08:31.082
Just get to know your student, Dr. McCord.

08:31.083 --> 08:34.729
Tell us what you think, that's all.

08:35.072 --> 08:36.493
MAN (on TV): <i>The White
House released a statement</i>

08:36.494 --> 08:37.688
saying that Delgado is undergoing

08:37.690 --> 08:39.323
emergency gallbladder surgery.

08:39.325 --> 08:40.625
The VP reportedly collapsed...

08:40.626 --> 08:42.827
I didn't know gallbladder
could have an emergency.

08:42.828 --> 08:45.830
Well, it can if it's inside

08:45.831 --> 08:48.433
the Vice President of the United States.

08:48.434 --> 08:50.569
Hey, one of you guys
needs to sign this paper

08:50.570 --> 08:52.537
- proving that I showed it to you.
- Good morning.

08:52.538 --> 08:53.972
- Morning.
- Why?

08:53.973 --> 08:55.840
Oh, 'cause I got a "C", and
they think I'm gonna hide it.

08:55.841 --> 08:57.075
They don't have the honor code

08:57.076 --> 08:58.810
in public school like the Quakers did,

08:58.811 --> 09:00.779
- so, they just assume you're a liar.
- No.

09:00.780 --> 09:02.714
Why did you get a "C" on your paper?

09:02.715 --> 09:04.649
- Because he's an average student.
- JASON: Wrong again.

09:04.650 --> 09:05.984
Does that ever get boring?

09:05.985 --> 09:07.552
Oh, Jace, this is civics.

09:07.553 --> 09:08.853
I thought you liked this class.

09:08.854 --> 09:11.222
I do, which is why I threw
myself passionately

09:11.223 --> 09:12.490
into the assignment.

09:12.491 --> 09:14.025
Write about an American

09:14.026 --> 09:15.894
who has a positive influence on society.

09:15.895 --> 09:17.940
I chose Erica James,

09:17.941 --> 09:20.276
The <i>Washington Chronicle</i>
journalist who's in prison

09:20.277 --> 09:22.378
for not revealing her sources.

09:22.379 --> 09:24.380
Well, maybe your teacher
wasn't looking for,

09:24.381 --> 09:26.682
you know, a convicted criminal.

09:26.683 --> 09:28.150
You mean like Rosa Parks?

09:28.151 --> 09:29.485
Nice.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.287
Mr. Crider said that being

09:31.288 --> 09:33.689
in prison actually prevents
Erica James from contributing

09:33.690 --> 09:36.158
to society in a positive
way, so, he, uh,

09:36.159 --> 09:37.604
- gave me a "C""
- Come on, Jace.

09:37.605 --> 09:38.961
I mean, it's an admirable point,

09:38.962 --> 09:41.012
but you had to know you
were poking the bear.

09:41.013 --> 09:41.664
Okay.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.432
So, what, civil disobedience
isn't important?

09:43.433 --> 09:44.733
ELIZABETH: Well, it is.

09:44.734 --> 09:47.107
And it will often get you
a "C" in your civics class.

09:47.108 --> 09:47.687
HENRY: Yeah.

09:47.688 --> 09:48.671
I have some good news.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.639
School elections were held yesterday,

09:50.640 --> 09:52.708
and I was elected Peer Mediator.

09:52.709 --> 09:55.010
Wow.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.412
That's cool.

09:56.413 --> 09:57.947
What... what is that?

09:57.948 --> 09:58.522
That's like...

of the talking stick.

10:00.150 --> 10:01.984
Oh, like round-table discussions?

10:01.985 --> 10:04.653
Yeah, but with a stick
that tells you when to talk.

10:04.654 --> 10:07.289
It's part of a program at
school they call Life Skills,

10:07.290 --> 10:09.124
something you'll never know about.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.427
So you're like a student counselor.

10:11.428 --> 10:12.661
No, mediator.

10:12.662 --> 10:14.029

10:14.030 --> 10:15.230
Oh.

those kind of things at our school.

10:22.973 --> 10:25.941
We had Sergeants-at-Arms,
which probably not very Quaker.

10:25.942 --> 10:29.144
Well, it's kind of a big deal,
and I'm happy about it.

10:29.145 --> 10:31.113

10:32.716 --> 10:34.249
just one quick question.

10:34.250 --> 10:35.951
Um... (laughs)

10:35.952 --> 10:38.519
I can sing, right?

10:40.489 --> 10:42.458
I mean, a little.

10:42.459 --> 10:45.461
Like, I'm not... I'm not awful, right?

10:45.462 --> 10:47.629
Are you kidding me?
Those Beach Boys songs

10:47.630 --> 10:49.498
you sing in the shower...
you kill it every time.

10:49.499 --> 10:51.667
I mean the good kind of kill, not the...

10:51.668 --> 10:54.870
Well, because there's this sort
of silly thing at work, but I...

- Yeah. S-Sorry.

10:59.009 --> 11:00.709

Air Force One is missing.

we can't find it.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.347
When did we last make contact?

11:38.348 --> 11:41.250
Half an hour ago, then they
suddenly went offline.

11:41.251 --> 11:45.052
They're out of radar range, so
we have no idea what happened.

11:45.721 --> 11:47.289

We're scrambling the F-15's out

They're about two hours

12:02.705 --> 12:04.339
the communications
system on Air Force One

12:04.340 --> 12:05.941
is the most sophisticated in the world.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.876
It's got firewalls
in front of firewalls,

12:07.877 --> 12:09.478
and every kind of
backup you can imagine.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.047
All of it is designed so
that this cannot happen.

12:12.048 --> 12:14.183

I mean, there's dozens of
reporters on that plane

12:27.530 --> 12:29.765
- who've suddenly gone dark?
- We've reached out

12:29.766 --> 12:32.534
to their editors, told them
the Wi-Fi is temporarily down.

12:32.535 --> 12:35.871
They've agreed not to report it,
but I don't know for how long.

12:35.872 --> 12:37.840
The Pentagon has taken us to DEFCON 3.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.274
And I think we should consider

12:39.275 --> 12:40.843
the decapitation strike scenario.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.879
Someone is trying to take down
the top tier of our government

12:43.880 --> 12:45.814

- It's being considered.

12:45.815 --> 12:48.450
The president and the vice president
suddenly out of commission at the same time?

12:48.451 --> 12:50.584
That's why it's being considered!

12:54.456 --> 12:58.227
Sir, I think it's time to
discuss the line of succession.

12:58.228 --> 13:01.128
Are we at worst-case scenario?

13:02.664 --> 13:04.566
Whatever's going on,

13:04.567 --> 13:06.702
we need an acting president.

13:06.703 --> 13:10.038
Has anyone reached out to the
Speaker of the House yet?

13:10.039 --> 13:11.907
He's on Air Force One.

13:11.908 --> 13:13.242
He and the prime minister

13:13.243 --> 13:16.111
were college buddies, so
he went to the funeral.

13:16.112 --> 13:18.580
Was his itinerary public knowledge?

13:18.581 --> 13:20.916
There was no reason to hide it.

- Yes, I...

13:43.973 --> 13:45.707

your constitutional law class at UVA.

I was hoping to come by and
bid my farewell today,

13:58.221 --> 14:00.522

Heck of a way

National Security Advisor.

14:02.625 --> 14:04.259
What do you mean? You're resigning?

14:04.260 --> 14:06.128
Yes. I gave my notice last week.

14:06.129 --> 14:08.530
- You must have heard.
- I had no idea

14:08.531 --> 14:10.933
- that it was official.
- Afraid so.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.634
My wife has some health issues.

14:12.635 --> 14:14.436
I'm very sorry to hear that.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.637
Thank you.

14:15.638 --> 14:18.072
It's been a pleasure to serve.

14:18.674 --> 14:20.609
Senator Gates and his staff are here.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.946
Well, it's been some time since
I found myself in this room.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.948
Senator Gates, you are, uh, familiar

14:25.949 --> 14:27.983
with the members of the
National Security Council?

14:27.984 --> 14:29.518
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

14:29.519 --> 14:31.954
Yes, yes, uh, very, very
unfortunate circumstances

14:31.955 --> 14:33.855
that we have to meet under.

14:33.856 --> 14:36.091
Uh, do we have any news?

14:36.092 --> 14:38.527
No. We are still out of communication

14:38.528 --> 14:40.429
with Air Force One, but
measures are being taken

14:40.430 --> 14:41.630
to upgrade the status.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.832
Oh, well, I guess in the meantime, then,

14:43.833 --> 14:46.034
we need an acting president, mm-hmm.

14:46.035 --> 14:48.937
In accordance with the
Succession Act of 1947,

14:48.938 --> 14:50.772
that would be you, Senator.

14:50.773 --> 14:54.843
Right, well, then, uh...
let's proceed, shall we?

14:54.844 --> 14:56.979
The Chief Justice will administer the oath.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.380
Uh, oh, here.

14:58.381 --> 15:01.049
It's a formality, but you will also need

15:01.050 --> 15:02.251
to resign your position

15:02.252 --> 15:03.252
in the senate.

15:03.253 --> 15:04.553
(chuckles): Uh, n... no way.

15:04.554 --> 15:06.521
No, I never agreed to that, mm-mm.

15:06.522 --> 15:08.790
No, no, no, it's-it's, uh, just protocol.

15:08.791 --> 15:10.125
You'll resume your seat

15:10.126 --> 15:12.160
- once the president returns.
- Mm.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.596
Oh, all right, right.
The president will come back.

15:14.597 --> 15:17.899
(chuckles) I mean, he survived
one assassination attempt.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.102
He's hard to kill. Hm.

15:20.103 --> 15:22.838
Wh... What do you mean, Senator?

15:22.839 --> 15:25.807
What do you think I mean? Talking
about that Charles Manson lady.

15:25.808 --> 15:28.142
Tried to shoot him.

15:28.777 --> 15:31.480
Well, that was President Ford.

15:31.481 --> 15:33.649
Ah. Of course, you're right.

15:33.650 --> 15:35.183
I meant Hinckley.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.885
Where do I sign?

15:40.722 --> 15:42.424
Um...

15:42.425 --> 15:44.960
actually, Senator,

15:44.961 --> 15:48.597
- Mm-hmm?
- I-I believe it is also protocol...

15:48.598 --> 15:52.434
you have to state the...

15:52.435 --> 15:54.670
full name of the current president.

15:54.671 --> 15:56.538
- For the record.
- Of course. Sure.

Ronald Wilson Reagan.

15:59.241 --> 16:01.376
I'm sorry.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.378
Could we ask the senator to...

16:03.379 --> 16:04.646
step outside

16:04.647 --> 16:06.348
- Hmm?
- just for a moment wh-while we prepare?

16:06.349 --> 16:07.883
- Is that all right?
- That's fine.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.984
- Thank you.
- Sure.

16:13.288 --> 16:16.023
(whispers): What the hell?

16:16.758 --> 16:18.794
Senator Gates had a
series of mini strokes

16:18.795 --> 16:20.762
a few months ago, but we are

16:20.763 --> 16:23.432
working diligently to get
him through his final term.

16:23.433 --> 16:25.100
He has his good days and his bad days.

16:25.101 --> 16:26.935
But basically, he's incompetent?

16:26.936 --> 16:30.672
To take the oath of office for president?

16:30.673 --> 16:32.673
Probably.

16:35.544 --> 16:39.580
Then I think we have to
go to the next in line.

16:40.482 --> 16:43.918

(laughs)

19:42.921 --> 19:44.589
Uh... crap.

19:44.590 --> 19:45.657
Harrison...

19:45.658 --> 19:46.925
That, uh, it's not what you think.

19:46.926 --> 19:48.527
Really? Because I think it's heroin.

19:48.528 --> 19:50.829
- You're supposed to be sober.
- I am. I am sober.

19:50.830 --> 19:52.397
It's-it's, um...

19:52.398 --> 19:53.932
it's an emergency stash.

19:53.933 --> 19:55.534
I used to hide them in
the lining of my coat,

19:55.535 --> 19:56.968
and I... I thought I got them all.

19:56.969 --> 19:59.004
But I apparently... didn't.

19:59.005 --> 20:00.871
Uh...

20:01.873 --> 20:04.810
Come on.

20:04.811 --> 20:07.179
You got to believe me. Uh...

20:07.180 --> 20:08.847
It's an old junkie trick.

20:08.848 --> 20:10.782
You can ask anyone.

20:10.783 --> 20:13.518
I don't know any other junkies.

20:13.519 --> 20:14.953
I'm not using, okay?

20:14.954 --> 20:16.354
I swear to God.

20:16.355 --> 20:17.689
(knocking)

20:17.690 --> 20:19.357
(sighs) It's room service.

20:19.358 --> 20:20.692
Just a minute!

20:20.693 --> 20:22.527
AGENT: Mr. Dalton, White
House Secret Service.

20:22.528 --> 20:23.662
(mouthing)

20:23.663 --> 20:24.762
Hang on!

20:25.630 --> 20:28.400
AGENT: Sir, we have to take you in.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.935
HARRISON: What's going on?

20:29.936 --> 20:31.369
We have a situation.
Finish getting dressed.

20:31.370 --> 20:32.471
We'll brief you on the way.

20:32.472 --> 20:35.073
We need to get you to a secure location.

20:35.074 --> 20:36.308
You, too, Ms. McCord.

20:36.309 --> 20:37.976
Um, I have to get to work.

20:37.977 --> 20:39.910
I'm sorry, you're coming with us.

20:42.748 --> 20:45.215
♪

20:46.952 --> 20:48.752
(sighs)

21:03.668 --> 21:05.370
Have a seat.

21:05.371 --> 21:07.172
Give me a moment.

21:07.173 --> 21:09.174
Ma'am, can I get you anything?

21:09.175 --> 21:10.509
She's fine, thanks, Lucy.

21:10.510 --> 21:11.643
Really?

21:11.644 --> 21:12.878
We don't have time for you

21:12.879 --> 21:13.879
to get comfortable, Bess.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.114
Oh, there's no danger of that.

21:16.115 --> 21:18.517
But I would love a cup of coffee.

21:18.518 --> 21:20.751
Of course.

21:23.989 --> 21:26.124
The jets are an hour away

21:26.125 --> 21:28.560
from being within radar
range of Air Force One.

21:28.561 --> 21:31.029
We'll be able to determine if it's
on a prerecorded flight path.

21:31.030 --> 21:34.166
If so, they'll try to get
close enough for a visual.

21:34.167 --> 21:37.269
Excuse me. Madam President's
former staff is here.

21:37.270 --> 21:39.004
We'll be with them shortly.

21:39.005 --> 21:41.606
And, Lucy, you don't
have to call her that.

21:41.607 --> 21:43.008
LUCY: Sorry, sir.

21:43.009 --> 21:44.543
The protocol is confusing.

21:44.544 --> 21:48.445
Tell me about it.
Send Colonel Preston in, please.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.348
(door closes)

21:50.349 --> 21:53.185
If it's any consolation,
I'm not enjoying this.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.287
In addition to everything else,

21:55.288 --> 21:57.789
one of my oldest friends might be dead.

21:57.790 --> 22:00.258
Why don't we get through
it with as little snark

22:00.259 --> 22:03.461
- as possible.
- Sorry, Bess. You're right.

22:03.462 --> 22:06.464
- HENRY: Hi, guys. May I join you?
- Yes.

22:06.465 --> 22:08.400
Thanks.

22:08.401 --> 22:10.502
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

22:10.503 --> 22:13.104
Ivan was just lecturing me
on the Ukraine,

22:13.105 --> 22:14.506
his favorite pastime.

22:14.507 --> 22:17.542
I'm simply making the point
that the Russian involvement

22:17.543 --> 22:19.978
in the Ukraine, if there were any,

22:19.979 --> 22:21.446
is no different

22:21.447 --> 22:23.281
than the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan.

22:23.282 --> 22:26.618
So the economic sanctions
implemented against us

22:26.619 --> 22:28.353
is quite hypocritical.

22:28.354 --> 22:29.654
No offense.

22:29.655 --> 22:31.623
HENRY: Nobody asked my
opinion about taking action

22:31.624 --> 22:33.992
- in either one of those disputes.
- The world

22:33.993 --> 22:35.126
is a safer place

22:35.127 --> 22:36.795
if we stand united against
those splinter group

22:36.796 --> 22:38.230
who have more firepower

22:38.231 --> 22:40.265
than philosophy.

22:40.266 --> 22:41.633
Very poetic.

22:41.634 --> 22:45.637
Well, sorry to bore you and rush off,

22:45.638 --> 22:49.174
but, uh, Russia is playing Brazil.

22:49.175 --> 22:51.009
We will get creamed.

22:51.010 --> 22:52.177
(chuckles)

22:52.178 --> 22:53.511
But still.

22:53.512 --> 22:55.847
(chuckling): Good luck.

22:55.848 --> 22:58.884
You're not a soccer fan, Dmitri?

22:58.885 --> 23:00.752
I prefer American football.

23:00.753 --> 23:02.020
Don't tell anyone.

23:02.021 --> 23:06.124
Ivan is pretty outspoken
about the situation in Ukraine.

23:06.125 --> 23:08.093
Well, that and anything else.

23:08.094 --> 23:11.396
Uh, he was... he was raised
in politics. His family

23:11.397 --> 23:13.198
are high-ranking officials
in the Kremlin.

23:13.199 --> 23:15.700
- Aren't you from a military family?
- Oh, yes,

23:15.701 --> 23:18.403
but my father was just
an Army field sergeant.

23:18.404 --> 23:20.272
He died in the Chechen conflict.

23:20.273 --> 23:22.540
Then there was my Georgian grandfather.

23:22.541 --> 23:24.341
Were you close with him?

23:25.310 --> 23:28.712
I found his stories amusing.

23:32.183 --> 23:34.519
This is the Football.
It's a remote device

23:34.520 --> 23:37.589
that can authorize a nuclear
attack in the unlikely event

23:37.590 --> 23:40.926
that we are required to do that.

23:40.927 --> 23:44.062
This is the Biscuit.
It's an authenticator card

23:44.063 --> 23:45.430
containing all the launching codes.

23:45.431 --> 23:46.932
That stays with you.

23:46.933 --> 23:48.767
The Football stays with the colonel,

23:48.768 --> 23:50.934
who is never far away.

23:51.569 --> 23:54.072
Thank you, Colonel.

23:54.073 --> 23:56.741
I hope we never work together.

23:56.742 --> 24:00.077
My hope as well, ma'am.

24:02.414 --> 24:03.782
(door opens)

24:03.783 --> 24:05.350
Until further notice,

24:05.351 --> 24:07.325
everything that's happening
here is classified.

24:07.326 --> 24:07.953
Of course.

24:07.954 --> 24:11.423
When order is restored, we'll...
figure out how to report it.

24:11.424 --> 24:14.059
In the meantime, we have to
be able to trust your staff.

24:14.060 --> 24:16.194
Well, I don't have any concerns there.

24:16.195 --> 24:17.696
Well, give them as little as possible.

24:17.697 --> 24:20.732
No mention of a decapitation strike.

24:20.733 --> 24:23.601
As far as we're concerned, it's
a perfect storm of bad luck.

24:23.602 --> 24:26.905
And when equilibrium is restored

24:26.906 --> 24:28.840
and I have my old job back,

24:28.841 --> 24:30.742
I'll give you my list of candidates

24:30.743 --> 24:33.111
for National Security Advisor.

24:33.112 --> 24:35.580
You neglected to tell me
Darren is resigning.

24:35.581 --> 24:37.949
Ah, sorry.

24:37.950 --> 24:39.617
His wife has...

24:39.618 --> 24:41.286
health issues.

24:41.287 --> 24:43.921
So he said.

24:45.557 --> 24:47.759
Is there some...

24:47.760 --> 24:50.694
reason why I was kept out of the loop?

24:51.329 --> 24:53.531
We were hoping to change his mind.

24:53.532 --> 24:56.401
This really can wait. I-I should
get back to the Sit Room.

24:56.402 --> 24:58.802
Of course.

24:59.571 --> 25:01.539
It goes without saying,

25:01.540 --> 25:04.342
but you are just warming that chair.

25:04.343 --> 25:06.244
Absolutely.

25:06.245 --> 25:08.847
Call if you need anything.

25:08.848 --> 25:10.849
Can you send them in?

25:10.850 --> 25:13.684
My staff.

25:14.319 --> 25:16.520
Sure.

25:27.298 --> 25:29.334
Would you like this closed, ma'am?

25:29.335 --> 25:31.301
Uh, yes, please.

25:35.006 --> 25:38.163
You better sit down.

25:44.606 --> 25:47.242
(birds chirping)

25:47.243 --> 25:49.610
(ducks quacking)

25:51.601 --> 25:54.236
Excuse me, Dr. McCord.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.572
Is my wife okay?

25:56.573 --> 25:59.041
The secretary's fine, but you
need to come with us, sir.

25:59.042 --> 26:01.310
This way.

26:01.311 --> 26:04.180
I'll get started on your
statement, Madam President.

26:04.181 --> 26:05.260
- No statements.
- We're going with

26:05.261 --> 26:06.361
no comment, Madam President?

26:06.362 --> 26:08.296
Please stop saying "Madam President."

26:08.297 --> 26:10.399
- I can't.
- Please try.

26:10.400 --> 26:13.402
Now, the only thing that
we are on record about

26:13.403 --> 26:16.104
is that the Wi-Fi is
down on Air Force One.

26:16.105 --> 26:18.440
I mean, obviously we
are in communication

26:18.441 --> 26:19.574
with the president.

26:19.575 --> 26:21.977
- DAISY: So lie?
- Yes, lie.

26:21.978 --> 26:23.678
In the interest of national security.

26:23.679 --> 26:26.281
You can imagine how the stock market
alone would react to the news,

26:26.282 --> 26:28.250
"We've misplaced the president."

26:28.251 --> 26:30.585
Um, should I inform
the deputy secretary,

26:30.586 --> 26:33.121
Madam President?

26:33.122 --> 26:35.123
I had to say it once.

26:35.124 --> 26:39.094
(sighs) Yes, but just...

26:39.095 --> 26:41.296
say I was called to the White House.

26:41.297 --> 26:43.565
Okay, are we assuming something
catastrophic has happened?

26:43.566 --> 26:44.966
I mean, is the president dead?

26:44.967 --> 26:45.934
Are we under attack?

26:45.935 --> 26:47.235
We're not assuming anything.

26:47.236 --> 26:49.771
Don't speculate.

26:49.772 --> 26:52.307
We'll know better in a couple of hours.

26:52.308 --> 26:56.044
Is there anything in my
actual office that needs

26:56.045 --> 26:58.480
- my immediate attention?
- Uh, Madam...

26:58.481 --> 27:00.881
Acting President?

27:01.516 --> 27:03.585
That's fine.

27:03.586 --> 27:05.587
I'm sorry to bring this up,

27:05.588 --> 27:08.023
but there is one pressing event

27:08.024 --> 27:09.458
- on your calendar today.
- (sighs)

27:09.459 --> 27:12.494
- The P.R.E.F. talent show.
- So we will have to

27:12.495 --> 27:15.197
provide a plausible
explanation for canceling.

27:15.198 --> 27:16.832
No, we can't cancel.

27:16.833 --> 27:18.233
We can't change anything.

27:18.234 --> 27:20.302
We have to keep her
agenda exactly the same

27:20.303 --> 27:21.903
if we want to avoid global panic.

27:21.904 --> 27:23.605
- He's right.
- Okay.

27:23.606 --> 27:25.674
But in the interest of full disclosure,

27:25.675 --> 27:29.911
I did some research, and
apparently I'm the two percent.

27:29.912 --> 27:31.446
JAY: Considering our situation,

27:31.447 --> 27:32.981
ma'am, there's no way

27:32.982 --> 27:35.550
that your singing could be
worse than your not singing.

27:35.551 --> 27:38.086
I think it'll be a photo finish.

27:38.087 --> 27:40.055
But I'm willing to take the bullet.

27:40.056 --> 27:41.756
We need this trade
agreement to go through.

27:41.757 --> 27:43.391
Okay, if you guys really want to help,

27:43.392 --> 27:44.993
then you will focus on this

27:44.994 --> 27:47.796
and make it really good. In the interest

27:47.797 --> 27:52.234
of national security, you
won't let me humiliate myself.

27:52.235 --> 27:55.703
That's all. Thank you.

27:59.307 --> 28:01.376
Your family's here.

28:01.377 --> 28:03.278
We're taking them to the
Emergency Ops Center

28:03.279 --> 28:04.746
in the basement of the East Wing.

28:04.747 --> 28:06.047
It's protocol until we know

28:06.048 --> 28:07.425
what's happening with the president.

28:07.426 --> 28:08.316
Can I see them?

28:08.317 --> 28:09.518
Yeah. Make it fast.

28:09.519 --> 28:12.754
There's something, uh,
you need to know first.

28:12.755 --> 28:14.588
And it's awkward.

28:20.128 --> 28:22.297
(sighs)

28:22.298 --> 28:24.966
Mmm.

28:24.967 --> 28:26.968
You doing okay?

28:26.969 --> 28:28.236
I have no idea.

28:28.237 --> 28:30.205
- Any update?
- Not yet.

28:30.206 --> 28:31.806
Listen, did they tell you about Stevie?

28:31.807 --> 28:33.842
Yeah, she's here with Alison and Jason.

28:33.843 --> 28:36.111
When they found her,
she was with Harrison.

28:36.112 --> 28:37.946
In a hotel room.

28:37.947 --> 28:39.481
(sighs) What are they thinking?

28:39.482 --> 28:41.550
- They're not. They're young.
- That's not an excuse.

28:41.551 --> 28:43.919
I know. But it's gonna have to be today.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.520
Right. Yeah, you're right.

28:45.521 --> 28:47.355
We got to be cool with her. We can't...

28:47.356 --> 28:49.324
wander into a big family argument.

28:49.325 --> 28:51.793
Exactly. But...

28:51.794 --> 28:53.662
You think I can't be cool?

28:53.663 --> 28:55.664
With the other kids, absolutely.

28:55.665 --> 28:57.966
You're Lou Reed.

28:57.967 --> 29:00.001
But when it comes to Stevie...

29:00.002 --> 29:01.036
What?

29:01.037 --> 29:02.270
She pushes your buttons.

29:02.271 --> 29:05.440
- I don't have buttons.
- Elizabeth.

29:05.441 --> 29:07.375
Fine. Maybe she won't bring it up.

29:07.376 --> 29:08.443
But if she does...

29:08.444 --> 29:10.145
- Lou Reed.
- I need you.

29:10.146 --> 29:12.914
Right. Think Velvet Underground.

29:12.915 --> 29:15.183
Of c... Obviously. I got this.

29:15.184 --> 29:16.885
Let's go.

29:16.886 --> 29:19.654
(sighs) Our jets are five minutes
away from Air Force One.

29:19.655 --> 29:21.856
Radar has confirmed that
the plane is on course,

29:21.857 --> 29:23.858
but there's still no
word from anyone inside.

29:23.859 --> 29:27.329
Working theory is that the
cabin has depressurized.

29:27.330 --> 29:30.232
- Everyone on board could be dead.
- It could be a ghost flight.

29:30.233 --> 29:33.134
Autopilot will keep it going
until it runs out of fuel.

29:33.135 --> 29:35.270
Yeah, and becomes a bomb
somewhere over the mainland.

29:35.271 --> 29:38.006
In that scenario, we need to handle it

29:38.007 --> 29:40.242
while it's over water.

29:40.243 --> 29:42.210
Your first act as president

29:42.211 --> 29:45.612
might be to shoot down Air Force One.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.339
- (indistinct chatter)
- (door opens)

30:02.609 --> 30:04.377
- Ah, ah, ah.
- JACKSON: What have we got?

30:04.378 --> 30:06.946
The jets are approaching.

30:06.947 --> 30:08.248
They've made visual contact.

30:08.249 --> 30:10.183
PILOT: I've got movement
inside the cockpit.

30:10.184 --> 30:11.785
Definitely somebody alive in there.

30:11.786 --> 30:14.454
- Is that Colonel Romano?
- Affirmative, sir.

30:14.455 --> 30:17.589
He's communicating through Morse code.

30:18.224 --> 30:20.927
Communication... down.

30:20.928 --> 30:24.631
Navigation okay.

30:24.632 --> 30:28.368
A-S-A-F.

30:28.369 --> 30:29.736
A-S-A-F.

30:29.737 --> 30:31.337
All souls accounted for.

30:31.338 --> 30:32.939
JACKSON: How do we know he doesn't have

30:32.940 --> 30:34.074
a gun to his head?

30:34.075 --> 30:36.342
That last sentence is code, sir.

30:36.343 --> 30:38.611
He wouldn't have used it
if he had been in distress.

30:38.612 --> 30:40.613
We're clear.

30:40.614 --> 30:43.716
Ma'am, I'd like to recommend
landing at Hickam Field.

30:43.717 --> 30:46.486
- The F-15s can escort them.
- Good.

30:46.487 --> 30:49.956
I want a completely secure hangar.

30:49.957 --> 30:52.325
And then we're gonna
take that plane apart,

30:52.326 --> 30:55.562
piece by piece, until we've
found out whatever caused this.

30:55.563 --> 30:56.696
Yes, ma'am.

30:56.697 --> 30:58.264
- Thank you.
- Bess,

30:58.265 --> 30:59.933
your tenure holds until we're back

30:59.934 --> 31:01.868
in direct communication
with the president.

31:01.869 --> 31:03.203
Understood.

31:03.204 --> 31:06.838
Nobody's breathing easy until
that plane touches down.

31:07.740 --> 31:10.175
ALISON: Can't you give us any idea?

31:10.743 --> 31:13.446
They just said security concerns.

31:13.447 --> 31:16.082
Well, if it were nuclear,
we'd all be dead by now.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.751
It's probably just another 9/11.

31:18.752 --> 31:21.020
Oh, no.

31:21.021 --> 31:22.822
I-I didn't mean "just"...

31:22.823 --> 31:24.290
Then don't say it, idiot.

31:24.291 --> 31:26.025
- I think we're okay, Noodle.
- (chuckles)

31:26.026 --> 31:28.827
By the way, he does know.
He just can't tell us.

31:32.665 --> 31:34.734
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

31:34.735 --> 31:36.335
Sure.

31:41.608 --> 31:44.444
Okay, I know that they told you
where they found me today.

31:44.445 --> 31:46.813
Honey, it's your life.

31:46.814 --> 31:48.114
You're an adult.

31:48.115 --> 31:50.683
We can't interfere with
who you decide to date.

31:50.684 --> 31:52.685
Believe me, I learned my lesson there.

31:52.686 --> 31:55.321
So... don't worry about it, okay?

31:55.322 --> 31:58.358
(chuckles) We got enough going on today.

31:58.359 --> 32:00.827
I'm really glad that you feel that way.

32:00.828 --> 32:03.161
Um, I really need your help, actually.

32:05.498 --> 32:08.268
I have heroin in my pocket.

32:08.269 --> 32:09.469
You have what?

32:09.470 --> 32:11.304
It fell out of the lining
of Harrison's jacket.

32:11.305 --> 32:13.373
And he swears that it
was just an old stash

32:13.374 --> 32:14.841
that he had forgotten about.

32:14.842 --> 32:17.877
And we were arguing about it
when the Secret Service came in.

32:17.878 --> 32:20.013
I panicked. I didn't know what to do.

32:20.014 --> 32:21.681
I slipped it in my pocket.
Now we're here.

32:21.682 --> 32:23.816
- I didn't have time to flush it...
- Are you out of your mind?

32:23.817 --> 32:26.452
In all the world, you choose

32:26.453 --> 32:28.621
an addict and not just any addict,

32:28.622 --> 32:30.823
the son of your mother's boss,

32:30.824 --> 32:33.074
who happens to be the
President of the United States.

32:33.075 --> 32:33.793
Dad...

32:33.794 --> 32:37.697
This is the only guy for you?

32:37.698 --> 32:39.966
You are gonna have to face the fact

32:39.967 --> 32:41.734
that something is compelling you

32:41.735 --> 32:44.103
to make the world's most
irresponsible decisions.

32:44.104 --> 32:46.906
It is wrong for you to date
someone this early in recovery.

32:46.907 --> 32:49.108
It's gonna hurt him,
and it's gonna hurt you.

32:49.109 --> 32:52.845
Can't you just get out of
your own way for a change?

32:52.846 --> 32:55.247
Get out of your mother's way.

33:00.186 --> 33:04.256
Peer Mediator's looking
pretty good now, huh?

33:05.558 --> 33:07.227
Unemployment figures
are coming out tomorrow,

33:07.228 --> 33:10.530
so I kept the president's
morning pretty light.

33:10.531 --> 33:12.031
How are the projections?

33:12.032 --> 33:14.167
Good, but I never trust them.

33:14.168 --> 33:15.602
I'm almost finished

33:15.603 --> 33:17.637
with the roster of Air Force One.

33:17.638 --> 33:20.607
Are we contacting the families
once they've touched down?

33:20.608 --> 33:22.408
Uh, I can handle that.

33:22.409 --> 33:23.843
One other question.

33:23.844 --> 33:27.814
Why is Craig Sterling on board?

33:27.815 --> 33:30.617
He was meeting with the president.

33:30.618 --> 33:33.453
Do you know him?

33:33.454 --> 33:35.488
He was at the defense department

33:35.489 --> 33:37.824
when I was at the CIA.
Yeah, you could say that

33:37.825 --> 33:39.759
- our paths crossed.
- What do you make of him?

33:39.760 --> 33:43.296
Nakedly ambitious,
self-serving obstructionist,

33:43.297 --> 33:45.431
all suit and no substance.

33:45.432 --> 33:47.533
But other than that, I'm a fan.

33:47.534 --> 33:50.136
I know he's on the short list

33:50.137 --> 33:51.971
for national security advisor.

33:51.972 --> 33:55.275
Not anymore.

33:55.276 --> 33:57.477
He's accepted the position.

33:57.478 --> 34:00.146
When?

34:00.147 --> 34:01.614
Yesterday.

34:01.615 --> 34:04.984
I can't believe Conrad
would make that appointment

34:04.985 --> 34:06.486
without consulting

34:06.487 --> 34:08.321
- with me.
- That's his prerogative.

34:08.322 --> 34:10.322
What's going on?

34:10.324 --> 34:12.592
Is this some kind of
reelection strategy?

34:12.592 --> 34:14.360
That's not the kind of decision

34:14.360 --> 34:17.130
- you shut the secretary of state out of.
- Don't be paranoid.

34:17.130 --> 34:19.532
The NSA is practically my counterpart

34:19.533 --> 34:21.100
on matters of foreign policy.

34:21.101 --> 34:23.235
He can't just force that decision on me.

34:23.237 --> 34:25.004
The President of the United States

34:25.005 --> 34:27.172
can do whatever the hell he wants.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.208
(sighs)

34:31.811 --> 34:33.946
(laughs softly)

34:33.947 --> 34:36.380
You know what? You're absolutely right.

34:38.650 --> 34:40.652
You can go now.

34:40.654 --> 34:42.554
Excuse me?

34:42.556 --> 34:45.623
Go. Now.

35:03.824 --> 35:06.229
The pardon attorney
says everything is in order

35:06.230 --> 35:09.099
and that the president needs to
sign in just these two places.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.867
And the papers don't
have to be processed?

35:10.868 --> 35:12.102
No, ma'am.

35:12.103 --> 35:13.903
He says the minute the
signature is confirmed,

35:13.904 --> 35:15.271
it's a simple phone call.

35:15.272 --> 35:17.607
Erica James will be released from prison.

35:17.608 --> 35:19.976
And the order cannot be revoked?

35:19.977 --> 35:22.479
No, ma'am. It's an official
presidential pardon.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.014
Your journalist will be home for dinner.

35:24.015 --> 35:25.281
Great.

35:25.282 --> 35:28.478
For what it's worth, I
applaud this action, ma'am.

35:28.479 --> 35:30.546
Thank you, Lucy.

35:30.547 --> 35:33.182
Well, it's reassuring to
know you don't knock on

35:33.183 --> 35:35.484
- the president's door, either.
- He's touched down.

35:35.485 --> 35:37.219
- Everyone is okay.
- Thank God.

35:37.220 --> 35:38.954
I'll take care of this
now, Madam President.

35:38.955 --> 35:40.222
Madam Secretary.

35:40.223 --> 35:42.357
Yes, sir.

35:42.358 --> 35:44.993
The, uh, initial sweep of the plane

35:44.994 --> 35:46.462
didn't turn up anything.

35:46.463 --> 35:48.997
NASA's reporting solar flares

35:48.998 --> 35:51.100
over that area. It's our
best guess right now.

35:51.101 --> 35:53.235
Thought that was impossible
on Air Force One.

35:53.236 --> 35:54.503
98%, which

35:54.504 --> 35:56.572
makes it more like highly improbable.

35:56.573 --> 35:59.308
Well, any idea

35:59.309 --> 36:01.543
on how we're gonna report on all this?

36:01.544 --> 36:03.846
Working on a strategy now. So, uh...

36:03.847 --> 36:07.382
what business was that? With Lucy.

36:07.383 --> 36:08.884
Oh, don't worry about it.

36:08.885 --> 36:11.887
The president can do
whatever the hell she wants.

36:11.888 --> 36:14.456
But you're not...

36:14.457 --> 36:16.123
But I was.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.995
HENRY: I don't think Ivan is your guy.

36:19.996 --> 36:21.530
Why not?

36:21.531 --> 36:22.931
There's something...

36:22.932 --> 36:24.900
unstable in all that

36:24.901 --> 36:25.934
passionate rhetoric.

36:25.935 --> 36:27.636
He's not a complex thinker.

36:27.637 --> 36:30.372
I feel like his opinions are
a mile wide and an inch deep.

36:30.373 --> 36:33.075
Our team's been vetting
him for a while now,

36:33.076 --> 36:34.510
and they feel differently.

36:34.511 --> 36:36.612
I have someone better for you.

36:36.613 --> 36:40.115
Dmitri Petrov.

36:40.116 --> 36:42.885
It's been my observation
that he has a better capacity

36:42.886 --> 36:44.887
for abstract thought,
a more analytical mind.

36:44.888 --> 36:46.955
He's quieter, more guarded,

36:46.956 --> 36:48.290
which means he's probably

36:48.291 --> 36:49.825
more discreet and disciplined.

36:49.826 --> 36:51.260
But what's his weakness?

36:51.261 --> 36:53.027
How can we get to him?

36:54.263 --> 36:56.165
His father died in Chechnya.

36:56.166 --> 36:58.400
I sense some inner conflict around that.

36:58.401 --> 37:00.836
And his grandfather was Georgian.

37:00.837 --> 37:04.072
So there's a foundation
of counter-nationalism

37:04.073 --> 37:07.142
in his background I think
we could cultivate.

37:07.143 --> 37:08.877
It's a better way to go than
just blackmailing someone

37:08.878 --> 37:10.345
because of their sexuality.

37:10.346 --> 37:13.582
And I know you guys like to
exploit people's secrets, but

37:13.583 --> 37:17.019
I think it's an unreliable,

37:17.020 --> 37:19.854
not to mention heinous, approach.

37:21.356 --> 37:23.091
You asked.

37:23.092 --> 37:24.526
That's my analysis.

37:24.527 --> 37:26.728
Mm.

37:26.729 --> 37:28.363
Then I want you to bring him in.

37:28.364 --> 37:29.665
You mean recruit him?

37:29.666 --> 37:31.099
And be his handler.

37:31.100 --> 37:34.369
What? No, wait... No. I-I
have no experience with that.

37:34.370 --> 37:36.104
I wouldn't have signed up for it.

37:36.105 --> 37:37.639
Henry, we need this.

37:37.640 --> 37:40.040
We believe you're the guy to do it.

37:42.778 --> 37:45.179
(indistinct conversations)

37:46.682 --> 37:48.716
The president's arrived.

37:53.055 --> 37:54.289
Elizabeth.

37:54.290 --> 37:56.291
It's nice to have you back, Mr. President.

37:56.292 --> 37:58.360
I wanted to thank you
for minding the store.

37:58.361 --> 38:00.429
My pleasure. Well...

38:00.430 --> 38:02.531
not really that, so much.

38:02.532 --> 38:05.534
I'm thrilled to relinquish the post.

38:05.535 --> 38:07.536
I saw your presidential pardon.

38:07.537 --> 38:09.771
I saw your national security
advisor appointment.

38:09.772 --> 38:12.740
All right. I'll give you that.

38:14.142 --> 38:16.612
Erica James really did
need to be released.

38:16.613 --> 38:18.814
Craig Sterling really is
the right man for the job.

38:18.815 --> 38:19.531
Mm.

38:19.532 --> 38:21.583
I'm sorry I couldn't let
you in on the discussion,

38:21.584 --> 38:24.620
but... I know you two have history

38:24.621 --> 38:26.154
and I couldn't get bogged down.

38:26.155 --> 38:28.390
With the secretary of state's opinion?

38:28.391 --> 38:30.891
I needed to make a move.

38:31.693 --> 38:34.763
Then I will do my best to work with him.

38:34.764 --> 38:36.298
Wanted to let you know that, uh,

38:36.299 --> 38:37.933
we released a statement to the press.

38:37.934 --> 38:40.369
We admitted to the
communications failure

38:40.370 --> 38:42.104
and the world knows

38:42.105 --> 38:44.172
that you were on the
desk for a few hours.

38:44.173 --> 38:46.375
- Ah.
- As usual,

38:46.376 --> 38:49.211
your approval rating
is higher than mine.

38:49.212 --> 38:50.979
Well...

38:50.980 --> 38:52.748
we have a long road ahead of us.

38:52.749 --> 38:54.016
I could tank at any time.

38:54.017 --> 38:56.585
Like in about five minutes.

38:56.586 --> 38:58.953
Break a leg.

38:59.621 --> 39:02.090
(exhales heavily)

39:02.091 --> 39:03.558
(inhales deeply)

39:03.559 --> 39:05.260
So, you're...

39:05.261 --> 39:06.495
kind of a funny color.

39:06.496 --> 39:08.196
- Are you okay?
- I haven't fainted

39:08.197 --> 39:10.065
in the longest time.
What does it feel like?

39:10.066 --> 39:13.467
Let's find you some private space.

39:14.970 --> 39:16.972
Madam Secretary, could...

39:16.973 --> 39:18.507
Oh, this doesn't look good.

39:18.508 --> 39:20.941
Madam Secretary, you okay?

39:24.813 --> 39:27.815
Yup, I am. I am okay.

39:28.817 --> 39:30.786
Just need to take a
look at those lyrics.

39:30.787 --> 39:33.021
Let's do this.

39:33.022 --> 39:35.290
How much time do I have?

39:35.291 --> 39:36.625
NADINE: Ten minutes.

39:36.626 --> 39:38.160
Or as long as you need.

39:38.161 --> 39:40.595
Mm. Okay. Okay.

39:40.596 --> 39:42.664
(humming a tune hoarsely)

39:42.665 --> 39:44.466

39:44.467 --> 39:46.134

- All right, so...
- (door opens)

41:58.000 --> 41:59.734
- ELIZABETH: Good night, you guys.
- Oh, look,

41:59.735 --> 42:01.903
- oh, there she is.
- ALISON: Aah!

42:01.904 --> 42:04.176
Oh, my God, you were president?

42:04.177 --> 42:06.212
How could you not tell us?

42:06.213 --> 42:07.152
Slipped my mind.

42:07.153 --> 42:08.228
Seriously, what was that like?

42:08.229 --> 42:09.395
It was exhausting.

42:09.396 --> 42:10.763
Well, forget that.
What was the song like?

42:10.764 --> 42:12.665
I'll tell you about it later.
How did it go with...

42:12.666 --> 42:14.834
- Great.
- Okay, good.

42:14.835 --> 42:16.602
Listen, I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed.

42:16.603 --> 42:18.749
Jace, tell your teacher
you're getting an "A".

42:18.750 --> 42:20.908
- ALISON: Good night.
- Erica James is coming home.

42:20.909 --> 42:22.006
(phone beeps)

42:24.443 --> 42:25.977
No.

42:26.870 --> 42:28.586
_

42:28.648 --> 42:30.782
Yes.

42:32.752 --> 42:34.220
Sorry.

42:34.221 --> 42:36.022
I know you've had a rough day.

42:36.023 --> 42:37.957
Well, we all have.

42:37.958 --> 42:40.793
But you need to be up to
speed on the situation.

42:40.794 --> 42:43.429
We got the test results
back on the vice president.

42:43.430 --> 42:44.764
No foul play.

42:44.765 --> 42:46.497
He's fine.

42:47.633 --> 42:50.735
That can't be why you called me in.

42:52.471 --> 42:53.806
Come in.

42:53.807 --> 42:56.275
Elizabeth, you know Craig Sterling.

42:56.276 --> 42:58.244
Madam Secretary. It's been a few years.

42:58.245 --> 43:00.646
Congratulations on your appointment.

43:00.647 --> 43:04.150
Pretty sure I wasn't first on your list.

43:04.151 --> 43:05.751
Why don't you

43:05.752 --> 43:06.952
tell Elizabeth

43:06.953 --> 43:09.555
what we know so far about Air Force One.

43:09.556 --> 43:12.525
The system malfunction
wasn't a solar flare.

43:12.526 --> 43:15.294
They found a piece of malware
on the plane... an incredibly

43:15.295 --> 43:16.962
sophisticated virus that knocked out

43:16.963 --> 43:19.331
every communication device.

43:19.332 --> 43:22.034
This took planning,

43:22.035 --> 43:25.271
resources and engineering.

43:25.272 --> 43:27.206
It couldn't have been a single actor.

43:27.207 --> 43:29.507
There had to be a major power behind it.

43:32.311 --> 43:35.982
This was an act of war.
