00:00.359 --> 00:01.626
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.660 --> 00:04.128
As soon as I saw you, I knew
there was no need for a DNA test.

00:04.163 --> 00:06.030
Dear Callie, I'm your sister.

00:06.065 --> 00:07.232
Her name's Sophia.

00:07.266 --> 00:09.033
You were way better than her.

00:09.068 --> 00:10.935
She only made the team because she's Latin.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.237
It doesn't even matter
whether I'm here or not.

00:12.271 --> 00:14.239
Well, congrats. It doesn't anymore.

00:14.273 --> 00:16.373
Hey, girls, change of plans.
Party at Mariana's tonight.

00:16.408 --> 00:19.210
I know it's not true, but my dad
won't let me sleep over at your house

00:19.245 --> 00:20.912
- because he thinks you're gay.
- He was brilliant.

00:20.946 --> 00:23.214
Even got into the junior
symphony. He got beaten up.

00:23.249 --> 00:24.215
His hand was shattered.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.084
Ok, you need to get everybody

00:26.118 --> 00:28.253
- out of the house now.
- How am I supposed to do that, Callie?

00:28.287 --> 00:30.221
Play! Ok, that's why
they're all here, isn't it?

00:30.256 --> 00:32.189
♪ Winter, summer, fall ♪

00:32.223 --> 00:34.025
♪ They're all washed up ♪

00:34.059 --> 00:36.261
♪ If you still wait over there ♪

00:36.295 --> 00:38.263
♪ Slide on in on my side... ♪

00:38.557 --> 00:40.458
It sucks being the responsible one.

00:40.492 --> 00:42.627
It was worth it, though,
getting to hear you play again.

00:42.661 --> 00:45.363
That first song, the only
reason they played it was...

00:45.397 --> 00:47.331
I knew they'd love it, and they did.

00:47.366 --> 00:49.667
They are obviously still alive, right?

00:49.701 --> 00:52.236
And if they're having a party,

00:52.271 --> 00:55.239
we'll certainly find
out about it soon enough.

00:56.542 --> 01:00.211
- Ok.
- Whoo!

01:00.245 --> 01:02.380
All right, everybody. No mercy.

01:02.414 --> 01:06.350
If we haven't used it in the
last three years, it goes.

01:06.385 --> 01:09.487
Oh. Hey, Mom, remember this?

01:09.521 --> 01:11.622
Oh, my God!

01:11.657 --> 01:13.457
- Here, take this.
- What is this?

01:13.492 --> 01:16.327
It's trash, trust me.

01:16.395 --> 01:18.329
Wait! Where are you going
with that? I love that vase.

01:18.363 --> 01:20.565
Hey, hey, no mercy, remember?

01:20.599 --> 01:23.467
For the record, it was a pretty ugly vase.

01:23.502 --> 01:26.537
If Brandon wants to use this as a
studio, Brandon should clean it himself.

01:26.572 --> 01:29.373
I am cleaning it, you're just helping me.

01:29.408 --> 01:31.475
It's not gonna be just Brandon's space.

01:31.510 --> 01:33.644
This is gonna be a hangout
space for everybody.

01:33.679 --> 01:35.546
Oh, no, no! No heavy lifting, Mama.

01:35.581 --> 01:37.548
Uh-uh-uh. You sort through these.

01:37.583 --> 01:39.617
Ugh! Geez! Thank you. Thank you.

01:39.651 --> 01:42.486
On second thought, I don't
want you getting hantavirus.

01:42.521 --> 01:45.523
Why don't you go sit
down and... and be pretty.

01:45.557 --> 01:48.326
Go delegate from over there.

01:53.232 --> 01:56.400
- What's that?
- Oh, I... I put my family tree together

01:56.435 --> 01:57.602
when I was in college.

01:57.636 --> 01:59.670
I traced my mom's lineage
all the way back to Africa.

01:59.705 --> 02:03.608
- Why?
- I don't know. I guess I was just curious,

02:03.642 --> 02:06.611
- about my history.
- I can't believe we kept all this crap.

02:06.645 --> 02:09.247
You guys are lucky to have all
this crap from when you were little.

02:09.281 --> 02:11.549
You know, to remember stuff.

02:11.583 --> 02:15.319
Well, hey, I have the best memento of all.

02:15.354 --> 02:20.224
- Oh, look who I found!
- "Mikey the Bikey!"

02:20.259 --> 02:23.527
- I'm sorry, what did you just call that?
- Mikey the Bikey.

02:23.562 --> 02:25.363
We all learned how to ride on him.

02:25.397 --> 02:27.632
Don't you think we should keep
that, for the baby to learn on?

02:27.666 --> 02:30.334
She's gotta start somewhere.

02:30.369 --> 02:33.537
Ok, wait. You just said "she."

02:33.572 --> 02:36.607
- It's a girl?
- We were not supposed to say anything.

02:36.642 --> 02:40.444
But yes, it is a girl.

02:40.479 --> 02:43.581
Outnumbered! Outnumbered!
You're outnumbered!

02:43.615 --> 02:45.416
You're outnumbered! You're outnumbered!

02:45.450 --> 02:48.619
- You are outnumbered!
- Hey.

02:48.654 --> 02:51.422
So have you, uh, you talked to Jude yet?

02:53.325 --> 02:57.428
No, I will. I just haven't had a chance.

02:57.496 --> 02:59.630
Ok.

03:43.608 --> 03:46.544
Wow. She looks just like you.

03:48.313 --> 03:50.614
Yeah.

03:50.649 --> 03:53.384
You know, at first, I didn't
think I wanted to meet her.

03:54.586 --> 03:58.556
But then I couldn't
stop thinking about her.

03:58.590 --> 04:01.392
You know, it's not her
fault that her dad...

04:01.426 --> 04:04.161
... my dad... left Mom, you know?

04:06.598 --> 04:11.335
It's weird when you say, "Your dad."

04:11.370 --> 04:14.338
I know, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

04:17.209 --> 04:21.144
Donald is our dad. Ok?

04:21.178 --> 04:24.181
Robert's just some guy I got some DNA from.

04:24.216 --> 04:26.484
What about Sophia?

04:26.518 --> 04:30.154
Well, she is just...

04:31.323 --> 04:32.523
... my half-sister, I guess.

04:32.607 --> 04:34.675
Like I'm your half-brother?

04:34.709 --> 04:40.414
Jude, you are my brother. Period. Ok?

04:42.517 --> 04:45.352
If you don't want me
to meet Sophia, I won't.

04:48.323 --> 04:50.591
If you want to...

04:51.593 --> 04:53.294
... I think you should.

04:55.430 --> 04:56.630
And you're ok with that?

05:08.677 --> 05:11.545
Hey. I'm sorry about the party.

05:11.580 --> 05:14.281
I shouldn't have said I stood up
to my dad when I just snuck out.

05:16.251 --> 05:18.519
I just didn't wanna hurt your feelings.

05:18.553 --> 05:23.324
But, you know, it wouldn't even
matter if I did stand up to my dad,

05:23.358 --> 05:26.560
'cause it's not like I
have a say. In anything.

05:33.702 --> 05:36.403
So, uh, when do you think
we'll have an answer?

05:36.438 --> 05:37.638
About the new principal, I mean?

05:37.672 --> 05:40.307
Well, the final interviews
with the search committee

05:40.342 --> 05:43.244
are tomorrow, so soon, I hope.

05:43.278 --> 05:44.152
Well, you got my vote.

05:44.153 --> 05:46.163
You've been doing a great
job since Karina left.

05:46.314 --> 05:48.482
Thank you.

05:51.453 --> 05:52.620
What's up?

05:54.723 --> 05:58.459
Um, I just wanted to let you
know that I've hired an attorney

05:58.493 --> 06:02.196
to represent my interests
regarding the baby.

06:02.230 --> 06:04.498
I didn't want you to be
surprised when he gets in touch.

06:04.533 --> 06:05.990
You're kidding, right?

06:05.991 --> 06:09.239
I think it's best if we let
them do the talking from now on.

06:19.548 --> 06:21.348
Let's go!

06:35.430 --> 06:39.466
Hey. What's going on? Did I
just see April crying outside?

06:39.501 --> 06:43.237
Oh, probably, yeah.

06:43.271 --> 06:45.573
- She's off the team.
- She is?

06:45.607 --> 06:47.374
Yeah, it's kinda your fault.

06:47.409 --> 06:50.411
- It's what?
- I'm kidding.

06:50.445 --> 06:54.582
I mean, mostly. She got completely
faded at your party, and...

06:54.616 --> 06:56.216
She wasn't the only one.

06:56.251 --> 06:57.551
She's the only one
whose pics are up online,

06:57.586 --> 06:59.219
looking completely trashed.

06:59.254 --> 07:02.389
She broke the code, so she's out.

07:02.424 --> 07:06.560
- But Kaitlyn was...
- Mariana, don't poke the beast. Seriously.

07:06.595 --> 07:11.398
Ok, so listen up. April's out,
so we need to fill her spot, ASAP.

07:11.433 --> 07:15.502
- Yes?
- Um, are we sure we wanna let April go?

07:15.537 --> 07:18.305
I mean, she's one of our
best dancers, and honestly,

07:18.340 --> 07:20.641
everyone had a pretty
good time the other night.

07:20.675 --> 07:24.311
April's behavior reflected
badly on all of us, so she's out.

07:24.346 --> 07:27.281
So we're having an emergency audition
session tomorrow after school,

07:27.315 --> 07:29.450
so spread the word, ok?

07:38.259 --> 07:42.196
- Nice crossface.
- Thanks.

07:42.230 --> 07:45.633
Relax, Foster, it's cool. We
don't need to make things weird.

07:45.667 --> 07:49.336
So it didn't work out.
We can be friends, right?

07:49.371 --> 07:53.407
- Teammates?
- Right.

07:53.441 --> 07:55.476
Jesus, let's go.

08:01.282 --> 08:03.417
♪ They call her dynamite ♪

08:03.451 --> 08:05.619
♪ 'Cause she's an explosion... ♪

08:05.654 --> 08:08.489
So has your brother said anything about me?

08:08.523 --> 08:11.392
- Who, Brandon?
- No.

08:12.560 --> 08:17.398
Jesus? Um, no, why?

08:17.432 --> 08:20.167
Well, we... we kinda
hooked up at your party,

08:20.201 --> 08:24.171
and he said he was gonna
call me and he, like, hasn't.

08:36.379 --> 08:39.248
- You hooked up with Hayley?
- No! Who said that?

08:39.282 --> 08:40.013
She did.

08:40.614 --> 08:43.245
I can't believe you hooked up
with another one of my friends!

08:43.385 --> 08:46.555
What the hell is wrong with you? I
mean, why can't you just date some girl

08:46.589 --> 08:49.191
in Science Club or something. God, Jesus!

08:49.225 --> 08:51.560
Science Club? Really? Relax.
It was a one-time thing.

08:51.594 --> 08:53.343
Oh, it better not be.

08:53.344 --> 08:56.086
Hayley really likes you.
She's upset you haven't called.

08:56.299 --> 08:58.500
- So you want me to call?
- Yeah!

08:58.535 --> 09:01.036
I'm not gonna let you
be some douche who, like,

09:01.071 --> 09:04.373
mows through girls faster than
Mom's WeedWacker. Call her.

09:05.342 --> 09:07.409
Sisters, right? What a pain.

09:18.188 --> 09:20.522
I really wanna be with you.

09:25.528 --> 09:28.097
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pressure you.

09:28.131 --> 09:31.100
No, it's not that. It's just, um...

09:32.302 --> 09:35.504
having sex is a violation of my parole.

09:35.538 --> 09:39.274
- Seriously?
- Mm-hm.

09:39.309 --> 09:41.276
They can do that?

09:41.311 --> 09:45.414
Yeah, they can do a lot of things.

09:45.448 --> 09:47.349
So how long you gonna
be on probation again?

09:49.319 --> 09:53.322
Um... you don't have to wait, or anything.

09:53.356 --> 09:56.492
- Like, if you wanna...
- No, no, I was making a joke.

09:56.526 --> 10:00.295
It's good. I can wait.

10:01.264 --> 10:03.399
I'd wait forever for you.

10:05.435 --> 10:09.405
You know the reason I came back from Indiana
wasn't 'cause I hated it there, right?

10:09.439 --> 10:13.542
I mean, them Hoosiers
are some very nice people.

10:15.278 --> 10:19.248
What I hated was being
somewhere you weren't.

10:23.319 --> 10:25.220
Because I love you.

10:25.255 --> 10:28.424
♪ I wanna be your world ♪

10:28.458 --> 10:35.476
♪ Your world ♪

10:51.759 --> 10:53.293
It's nice.

10:54.395 --> 10:56.530
- Is that a new song?
- Uh, no.

10:56.564 --> 10:59.366
I'm just finding an ending to an old one.

11:00.535 --> 11:04.338
So I decided I'm gonna meet my sister.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.541
- Uh, half-sister.
- Oh, yeah?

11:07.575 --> 11:12.412
- Well, you tell Jude?
- Mm-hm. He's cool with it.

11:12.447 --> 11:16.216
- It's kinda just how he is, though.
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

11:16.251 --> 11:18.285
- You're not late.
- Oh.

11:18.319 --> 11:20.220
Hell, I should leave
then, come back in an hour.

11:20.255 --> 11:22.256
Hey, Lou.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.424
- Hey.
- Ok.

11:24.459 --> 11:28.428
Well, um, I should leave
you guys to it. Have fun.

11:32.667 --> 11:36.270
- So, what's up there?
- What do you mean?

11:36.304 --> 11:37.538
It's pretty obvious you two have a history.

11:37.572 --> 11:43.477
- Or maybe a "present."
- Uh, she's my sister.

11:43.511 --> 11:47.481
- But you're not related.
- You know what? I hate when people say that.

11:47.515 --> 11:53.353
- Adopted siblings are related, ok?
- Sorry. She's not adopted.

11:53.388 --> 11:57.357
Callie. Yet. Right?

11:57.392 --> 12:01.328
Not legally, but we are a family.

12:01.362 --> 12:04.431
I mean, she's just as much
my sister as Mariana is.

12:04.465 --> 12:06.533
Ok.

12:08.703 --> 12:11.405
So, what do you want to work on?

12:11.439 --> 12:14.575
How about the song that
we did at the party?

12:14.609 --> 12:16.677
What was it called, "Outlaws"?

12:16.711 --> 12:20.280
Uh, it's pretty great. I thought
if we dirtied it up a little bit,

12:20.315 --> 12:21.481
we could add it to the set list.

12:21.516 --> 12:24.484
Actually, that song
isn't really for the band.

12:24.519 --> 12:26.687
- Why not?
- It's just personal.

12:26.721 --> 12:30.324
You don't think "Ape Man
Love Machine" is personal?

12:30.358 --> 12:33.293
Did you, uh, write it for someone special?

12:34.696 --> 12:38.432
No. I... I... I just
had other plans for it.

12:38.466 --> 12:42.302
Yeah? Well, I had other plans for
the band, which didn't involve you.

12:42.337 --> 12:46.506
But things change.

12:47.609 --> 12:51.411
Wow. Have you heard of
this, the "Word Gap?"

12:51.446 --> 12:56.250
So babies who aren't talked to enough are
headed for trouble in school from the get-go.

12:56.284 --> 12:59.553
Like basically your entire
ability to learn is wrapped up

12:59.587 --> 13:02.623
in how many words you hear
in your first years of life.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.391
Yeah. Makes sense.

13:04.425 --> 13:07.294
But with the two of us for moms,

13:07.328 --> 13:10.631
I don't think our child is gonna
have anything to worry about.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.666
What? You talk a lot.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.402
- Oh, I do?
- Yes, you do.

13:15.436 --> 13:16.256
Although...

13:17.608 --> 13:21.170
you really don't have a lot to
say about this Timothy situation.

13:21.242 --> 13:24.578
Honey, I love you, and I hear you,

13:24.612 --> 13:27.547
but I have a really big day tomorrow.

13:27.582 --> 13:31.385
I have to go in front of the
school board, which Timothy is on,

13:31.419 --> 13:33.687
and nail my interview, and I just...

13:33.721 --> 13:37.457
I really don't wanna get worked up
about how much his timing just sucks.

13:37.492 --> 13:42.362
And to top of it, I have to deal with
this visit to the Quinns tomorrow.

13:42.397 --> 13:44.631
Well, just use it as an
opportunity to suss him out.

13:44.666 --> 13:48.702
Oh, I'm planning to. I mean,
besides stalking her at work,

13:48.736 --> 13:52.539
don't you think giving Callie that letter
from Sophia was a little manipulative?

13:52.573 --> 13:55.542
And why hasn't he signed the
abandonment papers? What's that about?

13:55.576 --> 13:58.645
- Lawyers slow everything down, you know that.
- I'm so sick of lawyers.

13:58.680 --> 14:01.415
And Timothy's timing is
impeccable, and strategic.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.617
You have something he wants,
and he has something you want.

14:03.651 --> 14:07.321
You think he deliberately sicked his
attorney on us the day before my interview?

14:18.294 --> 14:20.204
Look, respectfully, I think we've

14:20.225 --> 14:22.654
gotten off track under Karina's leadership.

14:23.034 --> 14:24.801
If you look in the folders in front of you,

14:24.836 --> 14:27.804
you'll find my academic and financial plan

14:27.839 --> 14:31.007
to re-focus Anchor Beach on
our original mission statement:

14:31.042 --> 14:35.979
to educate, cultivate, and
motivate well-rounded kids

14:36.013 --> 14:38.048
who are engaged in their community

14:38.082 --> 14:41.151
with a focus on protecting the environment.

14:41.185 --> 14:43.787
That's why we chose this location,

14:43.821 --> 14:47.858
with the most extraordinary laboratory
in our backyard: the Pacific Ocean.

14:47.892 --> 14:52.729
I think it's time to return to our roots,

14:52.763 --> 14:54.764
and to bring Anchor
Beach back to greatness.

14:54.799 --> 14:58.068
And I believe that I can provide
the leadership to do that.

14:58.102 --> 15:01.137
Thank you, Lena. Nice job.

15:01.222 --> 15:05.058
But how exactly are you planning
on returning the school to greatness

15:05.092 --> 15:09.896
when you've been cutting programs ever
since you took over as interim principal?

15:11.799 --> 15:15.035
- I inherited a deficit.
- So as vice-principal,

15:15.069 --> 15:18.004
you were unaware of the
financial status of the school?

15:18.039 --> 15:21.808
No. I was fully aware
that things were tight.

15:21.842 --> 15:24.811
The government cut a
few programs last year,

15:24.845 --> 15:29.149
but when we lost the Cerars,
we lost our biggest donors.

15:29.183 --> 15:34.187
Which is why Karina was reluctant to
expel their son, and why she lost her job.

15:36.057 --> 15:39.025
Well, I think you've done a terrific job.

15:39.060 --> 15:41.127
You've made some tough calls,

15:41.162 --> 15:45.065
but I can't find fault
with any of your decisions.

15:47.134 --> 15:50.904
Just one last thing. As you've
disclosed, you're pregnant?

15:52.106 --> 15:55.008
- Yes.
- And what's your due date?

15:55.042 --> 15:57.811
And how long are you expecting
to be on maternity leave?

16:00.014 --> 16:02.716
Well, I'm fairly certain you didn't ask any

16:02.750 --> 16:06.119
of the male applicants
that question, but, um...

16:07.088 --> 16:10.924
Ok, Jude.

16:10.958 --> 16:13.026
What's the study of how
living things are classified?

16:16.964 --> 16:19.966
Come on, you know this one. Say
the first thing that comes to mind.

16:23.971 --> 16:27.140
- Ok, who else can answer?
- Taxonomy.

16:27.174 --> 16:30.910
That's correct. What
makes up the human genome?

16:30.945 --> 16:34.914
Five, six, seven, eight.

16:49.163 --> 16:52.098
- Wow. Jenna's really good.
- Yeah.

16:54.935 --> 16:56.903
She's Kaitlyn's friend?

16:56.937 --> 16:58.171
Why'd we even have auditions?

16:59.807 --> 17:02.709
I mean, why didn't she
make the team last time?

17:02.743 --> 17:06.046
- 'Cause you were better, duh.
- Really?

17:22.128 --> 17:23.730
Good job, Jenna.

17:23.763 --> 17:25.765
Just make sure you punctuate
that kick at the end.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.967
So it's really... here.

17:29.837 --> 17:31.738
Ok, next group. Let's see
what you've got so far.

17:56.263 --> 17:58.932
Damn! Go, Jenna!

18:26.894 --> 18:28.761
Is this some sort of quid-pro-quo?

18:28.796 --> 18:31.030
I get your vote as long as we
agree to share custody with you?

18:31.065 --> 18:32.132
'Cause that's not gonna happen.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.767
Honestly, Lena, it's nothing like that.

18:34.802 --> 18:37.737
Well, your timing would suggest otherwise.

18:37.771 --> 18:39.139
I'm not bartering with my child.

18:39.173 --> 18:42.108
I'm sorry you think I'm
such a horrible person,

18:42.143 --> 18:43.943
but I can tell you I will
be 100 percent objective...

18:43.978 --> 18:46.880
Forgive me if I have a hard
time taking you at your word.

18:48.182 --> 18:51.951
You volunteered to be our donor.

18:51.986 --> 18:54.053
You said that people
like us should have kids,

18:54.088 --> 18:57.023
and you wanted to help,
anonymously. And then you...

18:57.057 --> 19:00.126
- I read the contract.
- Yes. And you knew what it was going to say.

19:00.161 --> 19:03.696
You agreed that Stef and
I should be the parents.

19:03.731 --> 19:04.964
I thought we were friends.

19:04.999 --> 19:07.967
I trusted you because I
thought you had integrity.

19:08.002 --> 19:10.069
- I do.
- No.

19:10.104 --> 19:13.907
People with integrity,
they honor their word,

19:13.941 --> 19:15.008
even when it's not convenient,

19:15.042 --> 19:17.043
even when they change their minds.

19:17.077 --> 19:20.113
You can't just say that you have
integrity, you have to act like it.

19:25.819 --> 19:31.191
Ok, that's five for Tia, and one for Jenna?

19:34.128 --> 19:36.763
It wasn't me. I voted for Tia.

19:39.099 --> 19:42.202
- You voted for Jenna?
- Oh, yeah.

19:42.236 --> 19:45.004
I mean, Tia's totally the best dancer,

19:45.039 --> 19:47.974
but do you really think she's
the best dancer for the team?

19:48.008 --> 19:50.109
What do you mean?

19:50.144 --> 19:53.746
I mean, do you think she's
really gonna blend in?

19:53.781 --> 19:56.816
- That's all I was thinking.
- Why wouldn't she? Because she's black?

19:56.850 --> 20:00.753
Oh, my God, no! No, not that. No. I...

20:00.788 --> 20:02.755
I just... maybe she's too good?

20:02.790 --> 20:05.758
And what? She's gonna make
the rest of us look bad?

20:05.793 --> 20:07.894
No!

20:07.928 --> 20:11.831
No, I just... I thought 'cause
Jenna was Kaitlyn's friend...

20:11.865 --> 20:14.726
We don't vote for our friends,
we vote for the best dancer.

20:15.440 --> 20:18.073
Right. Well, then I vote for Tia, too.

20:18.137 --> 20:21.055
- Great. It's anonymous then.
- Unanimous.

20:21.056 --> 20:23.080
- What?
- Nothing.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.208
Ok, well, let's all take Tia to coffee.

20:26.242 --> 20:28.243
Get her to know her a little better.

20:28.277 --> 20:32.488
We can't. Mariana and I
have plans after school.

20:32.489 --> 20:33.489
Right.

20:47.964 --> 20:52.200
- You doing all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Good.

20:52.235 --> 20:54.302
A little nervous, maybe.

20:54.337 --> 20:57.939
Honestly, I'm not even sure
why I agreed to do this.

20:57.974 --> 21:00.308
Curiosity. We all wanna know

21:00.343 --> 21:04.012
what makes us who we are,
biologically, you know?

21:04.047 --> 21:07.149
I think that's gotta be
one of the hardest things

21:07.183 --> 21:10.118
when you're adopted.

21:10.153 --> 21:12.254
The rest of us, when
we wanna know something

21:12.288 --> 21:15.190
like why are my knees bad,

21:15.224 --> 21:18.260
or how come I can't sing,
we just ask our parents.

21:18.327 --> 21:22.364
And they tell us, "Yeah, well,
that's what happens to your knees,

21:22.398 --> 21:27.202
and it's only gonna get worse."
Or "None of us Coopers can sing."

21:27.236 --> 21:29.171
But you really can't do that.

21:29.238 --> 21:31.973
So it's ok. It's ok to wanna know.

21:32.008 --> 21:34.042
What if they don't wanna know me?

21:34.077 --> 21:36.144
Well, they asked you here, didn't they?

21:38.014 --> 21:41.083
You ready? Let's do this.

22:05.389 --> 22:08.324
Hey! So how'd your interview go?

22:08.358 --> 22:11.494
Oh! You know what? There
was a tricky moment or two,

22:11.528 --> 22:14.230
but I kinda think I killed it.

22:14.264 --> 22:16.299
Nice! You're totally gonna get it.

22:16.333 --> 22:18.367
What about you?

22:18.402 --> 22:21.537
How was your dance auditions?
Did you guys find your girl?

22:21.571 --> 22:24.507
Oh, yeah. We did. You know Tia Stephens?

22:24.541 --> 22:28.210
- She's a junior, I think.
- Oh, yeah, she seems like a sweet girl.

22:28.245 --> 22:32.148
Yeah, yeah, she is. And, you
know, she's black, so that's good.

22:32.182 --> 22:34.317
Why is that good?

22:34.351 --> 22:37.386
Oh, well, just 'cause, you
know, diversity and all that.

22:37.421 --> 22:39.088
What do you mean?

22:39.122 --> 22:42.158
Well, don't you, like, have
rules about clubs and teams

22:42.192 --> 22:44.293
having to pick some brown kids, too?

22:44.328 --> 22:47.196
You mean like quotas? No.

22:47.230 --> 22:50.199
No, we certainly encourage diversity.

22:50.233 --> 22:53.235
Because when kids from different ethnic
and religious and cultural backgrounds

22:53.270 --> 22:58.474
come together it's been proven that
it enriches learning and creativity.

22:58.508 --> 23:01.310
Ok, relax, Mom, I'm not
part of the search committee.

23:01.345 --> 23:04.180
You don't have to give
me the principal speech.

23:04.214 --> 23:06.415
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

23:06.450 --> 23:09.218
I guess just for the diverse
person it just makes them feel

23:09.252 --> 23:12.355
like they got a hand-out
or a leg up or something.

23:12.389 --> 23:15.257
- Are you feeling that way?
- No. No, no.

23:15.292 --> 23:17.360
I just... I don't want
Tia to feel that way.

23:17.394 --> 23:20.096
You know, because she's
a really good dancer.

23:20.130 --> 23:22.365
Ok. Well, you just do your
best to make sure she doesn't.

23:22.432 --> 23:25.067
Yeah, I will.

23:25.102 --> 23:27.169
So Hayley's coming over, if that's cool?

23:27.204 --> 23:31.240
- Yeah, sure. You guys have fun.
- Great.

23:33.543 --> 23:36.345
So you're 16?

23:36.380 --> 23:39.115
- What sign are you?
- Cancer.

23:39.149 --> 23:44.120
What? Me, too! Wait, when's
your birthday? June or July?

23:44.154 --> 23:47.223
- It's July 11th.
- July 15th!

23:47.257 --> 23:49.558
- Oh, my God, that's crazy.
- Sophia.

23:49.593 --> 23:52.128
Oh, my gosh. Sorry.

23:52.162 --> 23:57.400
- Your mom was a Gemini, right?
- Yeah.

23:57.434 --> 23:59.068
More iced tea?

23:59.102 --> 24:01.070
Uh, no, thank you.

24:01.104 --> 24:03.172
Any more caffeine and
I'm gonna shake apart.

24:05.108 --> 24:07.343
So how long has Callie been
with you and your partner?

24:07.377 --> 24:10.279
- Wife, they're married.
- That's great.

24:10.313 --> 24:14.250
We had a little marriage equality
fundraiser here a couple of years ago.

24:14.284 --> 24:19.455
Oh, that's nice. Thank you.

24:19.489 --> 24:22.525
Um, well, Callie and
Jude came to us about...

24:22.559 --> 24:27.096
- Um, it was over six months ago.
- Little over six months.

24:27.130 --> 24:31.167
That's terrific. You have,
what, two, three other kids?

24:31.201 --> 24:33.402
- Three other kids.
- Were you looking for more kids?

24:33.437 --> 24:37.273
- Was that the plan?
- Uh, no, actually. We weren't.

24:37.307 --> 24:40.443
But, uh, but we fell in love with them.

24:40.477 --> 24:43.479
How did they get placed
with you? I'm not...

24:43.513 --> 24:45.247
- Well, my...
- I was in juvie,

24:45.282 --> 24:48.117
and my case worker thought
I would do better in a house

24:48.151 --> 24:50.219
with no male authority figures.

24:50.253 --> 24:53.322
- Why?
- Oh, no, Sophia, that's not...

24:53.356 --> 24:59.428
It's ok. My brother Jude and I
were in a foster home with, um...

24:59.463 --> 25:01.297
With an unfit foster father.

25:04.301 --> 25:09.472
Well, I think it's terrific that you've
taken them in and are adopting them.

25:09.506 --> 25:14.083
Well, Jude and Callie have been an
incredible gift to us, all of us.

25:14.117 --> 25:18.321
Um, hey, can I take Callie
upstairs? I wanna show her my room.

25:18.355 --> 25:20.223
Yeah, of course. Sure, honey.

25:20.257 --> 25:22.325
I mean, if she wants to.

25:22.359 --> 25:25.294
- Yeah, great.
- Ok.

25:34.137 --> 25:36.072
So when are you planning on adopting her?

25:36.106 --> 25:38.474
Uh, well, as soon as your
husband signs the paperwork.

25:38.509 --> 25:41.310
We're just waiting on him.

25:47.117 --> 25:49.519
- You won all these?
- Yeah.

25:49.553 --> 25:52.188
I was kinda one of those
horse girls for a while.

25:52.222 --> 25:55.224
- Not anymore?
- No. Not so much.

25:55.259 --> 25:58.494
I mean, I still have my horse,
but I don't get to ride that often.

25:58.529 --> 26:03.299
- Why not?
- You know, school, activities,

26:03.333 --> 26:08.337
- SAT prep, all that stuff.
- You're taking SAT prep?

26:08.372 --> 26:11.240
- Aren't you a freshman?
- Oh, yeah.

26:11.275 --> 26:14.443
But my school, and my family,

26:14.478 --> 26:18.281
think all that stuff is
super important. So...

26:18.315 --> 26:20.483
You like horses?

26:20.517 --> 26:25.288
Um...  I've never been on one.

26:25.322 --> 26:29.258
Really? Well, let me
take you riding sometime.

26:29.293 --> 26:30.356
I mean, it's super fun,

26:30.357 --> 26:33.437
when you're not like competing
and trying to win and all that.

26:34.164 --> 26:36.332
But you always were? Competing, I mean?

26:36.366 --> 26:39.101
Yeah.

26:41.171 --> 26:44.507
- So, what do you do for fun?
- School's fun, I guess.

26:44.541 --> 26:48.210
- What about you?
- I play guitar,

26:48.245 --> 26:53.282
and I hang out with my boyfriend.

26:53.317 --> 26:56.319
Wait, you have a boyfriend?

26:56.353 --> 26:58.454
- What's his name?
- Uh, Wyatt.

26:58.488 --> 27:03.359
Is it serious? Do you, like, love him?

27:05.362 --> 27:09.098
I do, actually. Yeah.

27:09.132 --> 27:11.434
Just haven't told him yet.

27:11.468 --> 27:16.372
- Why not?
- There was someone else that I loved,

27:16.406 --> 27:19.175
not all that long ago.

27:19.209 --> 27:23.150
And just saying those words to Wyatt

27:23.866 --> 27:26.101
makes me feel like I am,

27:26.202 --> 27:27.102
I don't know, betraying him...

27:28.320 --> 27:31.389
but I know it's... I
don't know it's over, so...

27:35.260 --> 27:39.163
- Yeah, we should, um...
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

27:39.197 --> 27:42.466
But can we hang out again? Like, soon?

27:42.501 --> 27:46.370
We could go riding, or
to a movie, or shopping.

27:46.405 --> 27:49.073
I really love what you have on.

27:49.107 --> 27:53.511
Oh, um, yeah, you, too.
That's a cool jacket.

27:53.545 --> 27:56.380
Thanks.

27:56.415 --> 28:00.217
- Great. So let's go shopping.
- Yeah, I'd like that.

28:00.252 --> 28:03.053
Hey, I want you to meet my dog.

28:03.088 --> 28:05.256
He's seriously, like,
the cutest thing ever.

28:05.290 --> 28:07.258
Ok.

28:09.060 --> 28:11.362
I was just so shocked when
I found out about Callie.

28:11.396 --> 28:13.130
I guess I needed to see her for myself.

28:13.165 --> 28:16.500
I know it was inappropriate,
and I am sorry.

28:18.303 --> 28:22.239
I just couldn't believe Colleen
had a baby and never told me.

28:22.274 --> 28:25.042
But then I thought about it, and...

28:25.076 --> 28:27.044
... she was probably afraid
of what my family might do.

28:27.078 --> 28:30.281
- Like what?
- Like try and take the baby from her,

28:30.315 --> 28:31.382
get some kind of custody rights.

28:31.416 --> 28:33.217
They would have done that?

28:34.453 --> 28:37.354
You know, I met Colleen when...

28:37.389 --> 28:39.190
... when I was home from grad school.

28:39.224 --> 28:42.293
And she worked at the beach
club that my family belonged to.

28:42.327 --> 28:46.197
And we... we fell in love.

28:48.467 --> 28:52.403
But my family just assumes anyone who
isn't from some money is a gold-digger.

28:52.437 --> 28:55.105
Which, by the way,

28:55.140 --> 28:58.442
are why these abandonment
papers are taking so long.

28:58.477 --> 29:02.413
- Hm...
- Anyway, we eloped,

29:02.447 --> 29:04.148
thinking we could make a go of it,

29:04.182 --> 29:07.051
but once my parents found out, I...

29:07.085 --> 29:09.253
It got ugly.

29:09.287 --> 29:13.123
I'm ashamed to admit that I couldn't
stand up to the pressure from my dad.

29:13.158 --> 29:17.294
I was young, and, uh...

29:17.329 --> 29:20.364
Anyway, I eventually gave in,

29:20.398 --> 29:24.468
and let him have the marriage dissolved.

29:24.503 --> 29:29.273
It is without a doubt the single
greatest regret of my life.

29:31.209 --> 29:35.513
I loved Colleen very
much, and if I had any idea

29:35.547 --> 29:38.282
that she was pregnant,
I never would've left.

29:41.253 --> 29:44.221
Um, I found them, they
were playing with the dog.

29:44.256 --> 29:47.424
- But Sophia has a ton of homework, so...
- Yeah. Of course.

29:47.459 --> 29:52.096
- We should get home.
- I'll go tell the girls.

29:54.165 --> 29:56.467
I'm sorry. This hasn't
been easy on my wife.

29:56.501 --> 29:59.069
I understand.

29:59.104 --> 30:02.239
There's something else I've
been thinking about. I, um...

30:02.274 --> 30:06.510
I'd like to set up a college
fund for Callie, if that's ok?

30:06.545 --> 30:11.081
Um... well, that's very nice.

30:11.116 --> 30:13.217
I would need to discuss it with my wife,

30:13.251 --> 30:15.085
but that's very generous, thank you.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.555
It's nothing. I'd be honored, really.

30:17.589 --> 30:20.457
I feel like I owe her something.

30:20.492 --> 30:23.093
After all, she is my daughter.

30:27.016 --> 30:29.290
I hope it's ok I told
the girls we had plans.

30:29.308 --> 30:31.476
I just, I don't want them
all up in my business.

30:31.511 --> 30:36.348
Oh. Yeah, totally. Jesus should be
here soon. I'm glad he called you.

30:36.382 --> 30:38.083
Can I borrow your toothbrush?

30:39.252 --> 30:43.455
Um, sure? It's the purple one right there.

30:45.491 --> 30:49.427
Hey, so, um, something's been bugging me.

30:49.462 --> 30:53.098
Since I got on the team, I
overheard Kaitlyn tell Jenna

30:53.132 --> 30:57.002
that it was just because
I'm, you know, diverse.

30:57.036 --> 30:59.237
But I was talking to my mom,

30:59.305 --> 31:03.008
and she told me there
aren't quotas or anything.

31:03.042 --> 31:06.077
And I know I'm not a
better dancer than Jenna.

31:10.516 --> 31:14.286
- Truth?
- Yes, please.

31:14.320 --> 31:18.023
You maybe had a little advantage
because your mom's principal.

31:18.057 --> 31:20.325
- Well, she's not yet.
- Well, she's gonna be.

31:20.359 --> 31:23.461
And with all the programs and clubs they've
been cutting, we just thought that...

31:23.496 --> 31:27.065
She'd never cut the dance
team if her daughter was on it.

31:27.099 --> 31:30.268
So I'm like an insurance policy.

31:30.303 --> 31:34.406
- Great, I'm the Geico lizard of the dance team.
- No, it's not like that.

31:36.075 --> 31:38.276
Ok, but so what? I mean, everyone uses

31:38.311 --> 31:40.512
whatever advantages they've got, right?

31:40.546 --> 31:41.930
And you're so much better now,

31:42.631 --> 31:44.097
you could almost make the team anyway.

31:47.286 --> 31:50.488
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sure you are.

31:50.523 --> 31:51.860
I voted for you.

31:52.161 --> 31:55.190
After all but sabotaging
me with those questions?

31:55.194 --> 31:58.330
- Especially about my pregnancy.
- So that you could address it.

31:58.966 --> 32:01.981
It was on people's minds,
and you handled it perfectly.

32:02.268 --> 32:06.004
Everyone was very impressed
with your presentation.

32:06.038 --> 32:09.174
If I didn't get this because
I'm pregnant, that's illegal.

32:09.208 --> 32:13.078
That's not why. They want new blood.

32:13.112 --> 32:17.248
And the worst part, the woman who
got it isn't even really an educator.

32:17.283 --> 32:20.051
She's corporate.

32:20.086 --> 32:24.055
If it's any consolation, all
the teachers fought for you.

32:27.093 --> 32:31.363
And, uh... this is for you.

32:52.451 --> 32:54.419
- I'm glad you called.
- Me, too.

32:54.453 --> 32:58.156
I mean, I don't hook up with just anybody.

32:58.190 --> 32:59.424
Me neither.

33:01.060 --> 33:04.095
I had my eye on you at the gym.

33:04.130 --> 33:05.397
And I saw you looking at me.

33:05.431 --> 33:07.683
All the guys look at
you. You know that, right?

33:09.636 --> 33:12.303
- Yeah.
- You could have any guy you want.

33:12.338 --> 33:15.206
Well, I want you.

33:15.274 --> 33:19.110
But, um, maybe it's best

33:19.145 --> 33:21.479
if we don't tell anyone about this.

33:21.514 --> 33:26.184
At least not right now. You're great. I...

33:26.218 --> 33:30.055
I just don't wanna deal with a bunch of
gossip and teasing from the dance girls.

33:30.089 --> 33:35.026
And honestly, I'd kinda rather
my ex not find out about us yet.

33:35.061 --> 33:37.195
- Are you still into him?
- No.

33:37.229 --> 33:40.131
What about you? Are you over Emma?

33:40.166 --> 33:43.368
Yeah. Of course.

33:53.552 --> 33:57.355
Hey. I thought Hayley was coming over.

33:57.389 --> 33:59.424
Oh, uh, she's upstairs.

33:59.458 --> 34:02.227
I was just getting us a little snackeroo.

34:02.261 --> 34:04.496
Ok, nothing with too much sugar, ok?

34:06.298 --> 34:10.467
Hey, so you're not gonna be making
any more budget cuts, are you?

34:10.503 --> 34:14.304
Like, to dance? 'Cause I'm really into it.

34:14.340 --> 34:16.241
It's really not up to me anymore.

34:16.275 --> 34:19.377
Wait, what? Why not?

34:19.411 --> 34:21.079
I didn't get the principal job.

34:21.112 --> 34:23.081
What? No, I thought you killed it.

34:23.114 --> 34:27.351
I did kill it. But they just
decided to go with someone else.

34:27.386 --> 34:30.121
- They can't!
- Honey, I appreciate you being upset for me,

34:30.156 --> 34:33.224
- but it's what it is.
- It's not fair.

34:33.259 --> 34:35.260
Well, look on the bright side.

34:35.293 --> 34:37.061
Now the other kids can't get mad at you

34:37.096 --> 34:38.463
because your mom's the
one making budget cuts.

34:38.496 --> 34:41.232
Do you think the new principal
is gonna be making cuts?

34:41.266 --> 34:43.268
I have no idea.

34:43.302 --> 34:47.338
Oh, could you get that, please?

34:47.373 --> 34:48.540
Sure.

35:09.161 --> 35:12.130
- Hey.
- Is Jesus home?

35:12.164 --> 35:18.069
Um... no, he isn't. I'm sorry.

35:21.207 --> 35:24.108
Will you tell him I stopped by?

35:25.311 --> 35:27.045
Sure.

35:46.872 --> 35:49.006
The kids told me.

35:49.040 --> 35:51.842
I'm so sorry. They're idiots.

35:51.877 --> 35:55.846
Not the kids, the... the search committee.

35:58.950 --> 36:02.920
- I really wanted this.
- I know you did, baby. I know.

36:08.026 --> 36:12.963
- Did they say why?
- New blood.

36:12.998 --> 36:16.000
They think I'm tainted by Karina.

36:16.034 --> 36:19.036
Oh, please.

36:19.070 --> 36:20.971
I know they could never admit this,

36:21.006 --> 36:24.875
but I have to wonder if me being pregnant

36:24.910 --> 36:27.044
has something to do with it.

36:27.078 --> 36:31.015
Timothy even asked me about my
maternity leave during the interview.

36:31.049 --> 36:34.852
Of course he did, ass that he is.

36:34.886 --> 36:38.022
Maybe not as big an ass as we thought.

36:40.025 --> 36:42.259
He signed the donor agreement.

36:42.294 --> 36:45.930
What? You're kidding! Are you kidding me?

36:45.964 --> 36:51.168
- No.
- Wow! Uh... why? Did he say why?

36:51.202 --> 36:55.072
I don't know. Turns out he
has some integrity after all?

36:55.106 --> 36:58.175
I didn't get a chance to ask him.

36:58.209 --> 37:02.012
Well, at least some
good news after all, huh?

37:03.949 --> 37:06.984
Yeah.

37:07.018 --> 37:09.954
Maybe it's...

37:09.988 --> 37:12.856
Maybe it's for the best.

37:12.891 --> 37:15.225
You know, I won't be under so much stress

37:15.260 --> 37:19.229
and I can take a longer maternity leave.

37:22.300 --> 37:26.937
The one consolation to losing this job

37:26.972 --> 37:30.941
is we get to have this beautiful baby.

37:30.976 --> 37:33.944
Which is so much better.

37:33.979 --> 37:35.980
Yes.

37:38.183 --> 37:42.853
So how were the, uh... how were the Quinns?

37:42.887 --> 37:45.990
Oh! They were, uh, nice enough.

37:46.057 --> 37:50.160
Although I think, uh, Mrs. Quinn is a
little freaked out about all of this.

37:50.195 --> 37:54.264
- What'd she say?
- Nothing.

37:54.299 --> 37:57.001
But why wouldn't she be?

37:58.136 --> 37:59.770
Robert, uh...

37:59.804 --> 38:04.875
Robert wants to set up a
college fund for Callie.

38:04.909 --> 38:09.213
- Wow! Really?
- I just...

38:09.247 --> 38:13.851
I don't know, something about it
makes me feel a little uncomfortable.

38:13.885 --> 38:18.022
- You know, would it be a bad thing?
- A college fund? No.

38:18.056 --> 38:20.924
No, sorry. Timothy.

38:20.959 --> 38:23.193
Letting him be a part of the baby's life.

38:23.228 --> 38:28.132
Not as a father, but as, um, a donor.

38:28.166 --> 38:30.234
And a friend.

38:30.268 --> 38:36.140
I just, I saw how Callie was so taken
with Robert and Sophia, and I get it.

38:36.174 --> 38:38.976
Everyone wants to know their history.

38:39.010 --> 38:45.049
And are we really gonna keep
that a secret from our child?

38:47.018 --> 38:51.188
As long as he's not asking to be the dad,

38:51.222 --> 38:56.026
isn't a little more love
and support a good thing?

38:56.061 --> 39:02.032
Maybe we could find even little room...

39:02.067 --> 39:05.069
... for that. I don't...

39:05.103 --> 39:06.804
I don't know.

39:12.844 --> 39:15.779
- What's she like?
- She's cool.

39:15.814 --> 39:18.182
- Yeah?
- Kinda young, maturity wise.

39:18.216 --> 39:21.852
But, um, I like her.

39:23.188 --> 39:27.925
- You gonna see her again?
- I am, yeah.

39:27.959 --> 39:31.028
We have plans to go
horseback riding, I think.

39:31.062 --> 39:33.864
Wow.

39:37.135 --> 39:43.040
So listen, um, is it cool if the
band starts playing "Outlaws?"

39:43.074 --> 39:46.877
It's just, Lou really digs the song,

39:46.911 --> 39:49.947
- and so do the guys...
- Brandon, it's not up to me.

39:49.981 --> 39:53.050
- You wrote it.
- Yeah, I know.

39:54.185 --> 39:58.889
But I wrote it for you.

40:00.325 --> 40:03.127
I know it sounds stupid, but...

40:03.161 --> 40:06.830
- I don't know, I felt like I was...
- Betraying something?

40:06.898 --> 40:08.832
Yeah.

40:11.936 --> 40:12.970
Let Lou have the song.

40:29.988 --> 40:33.290
- You called?
- Yeah, thanks for coming.

40:33.324 --> 40:35.859
I didn't...

40:36.961 --> 40:38.862
I didn't wanna say this over the phone.

40:41.032 --> 40:42.866
I love you, too.

40:56.181 --> 40:59.950
- Callie, come here a second.
- Uh, yeah?

41:05.123 --> 41:08.025
Um, when's the last time you spoke to Jude?

41:08.059 --> 41:12.863
Um, I don't know, this morning, I think.

41:12.897 --> 41:15.999
More specifically, when was
the last time he spoke to you?

41:18.269 --> 41:20.170
Hey.

41:22.907 --> 41:27.244
So I, um, I got a call from
Barbara, your science teacher.

41:33.117 --> 41:36.019
She said that you refused
to speak in class today.

41:37.922 --> 41:40.090
Did something happen?

41:40.124 --> 41:42.960
Is everything ok?

41:46.331 --> 41:48.866
Jude, what's going on?

41:53.204 --> 41:55.272
Jude, talk to me.
