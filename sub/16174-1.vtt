01:23.084 --> 01:25.754
When the sun starts to dip
in the Hollywood Hills

01:25.920 --> 01:30.550
the light often takes on the saturated
loveliness of color by Technicolor.

01:30.717 --> 01:33.386
The homes of the movie
stars in the late 1930s,

01:33.553 --> 01:35.638
said to be fabulous, were.

01:35.805 --> 01:40.435
And the cocktails and dinner gatherings
saw the film colonies crème de la crème

01:40.602 --> 01:43.104
draining highballs , exchanging rumors,

01:43.271 --> 01:45.690
making deals and trading gossip.

01:45.857 --> 01:49.694
No A-list affair was complete
without the presence of Phil Stern,

01:49.861 --> 01:52.238
one of the towns most
high powered agents

01:52.405 --> 01:54.115
and his lovely wife, Karen.

01:54.574 --> 01:58.787
Brilliant and dynamic, Stern could
invariably be found holding court.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.706
I saw Paul Muni on stage in New York

02:01.873 --> 02:05.084
and I was the first one to determine
that he could do films.

02:05.627 --> 02:09.964
I pegged it. I saw him long before anyone
else knew he would be a film actor.

02:10.131 --> 02:13.134
- You had the idea?
- I knew that he could make the transition.

02:13.426 --> 02:15.094
What was his quality?

02:15.261 --> 02:17.138
Watch the spilling please.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.265
It's a good party.

02:19.432 --> 02:20.558
Excuse me.

02:21.017 --> 02:23.603
- A telephone call, Mr. Stern.
- For me?

02:23.770 --> 02:26.606
I better take this.
I'm expecting a call from Ginger Rogers.

02:26.773 --> 02:28.691
I told her I could be reached here.

02:29.442 --> 02:32.487
She's not happy with her
representation, so who knows?

02:41.120 --> 02:41.955
Phil Stern here.

02:42.247 --> 02:44.249
Phil, it's Rose.

02:44.666 --> 02:45.375
Rose?

02:45.917 --> 02:46.876
Your sister!

02:47.794 --> 02:49.420
How did you find me here?

02:49.712 --> 02:51.798
Your housekeeper gave me the number.

02:52.298 --> 02:53.258
What's wrong?

02:53.758 --> 02:56.511
Bobby quit Marty's jewelry business.

02:56.678 --> 02:58.680
- And he's coming to Hollywood.

02:58.847 --> 03:02.308
I was hoping you could find
something for him in your agency.

03:02.976 --> 03:03.768
Who?

03:04.143 --> 03:05.144
Bobby.

03:05.478 --> 03:06.646
My son.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.106
Your nephew.

03:08.606 --> 03:09.399
Phil.

03:09.566 --> 03:12.443
We're talking to Warner Brothers for next
summer if they get the rights to the book.

03:12.610 --> 03:14.529
- And Bette Davis would be perfect.

03:14.779 --> 03:17.031
If they get the rights
to the book, we'll talk.

03:17.198 --> 03:21.494
Until that happens, trying to make that
deal is like trying to light a wet match.

03:21.661 --> 03:24.664
- Let me just get off this call.
- Get off the phone, we'll sit down.

03:28.793 --> 03:31.045
- Hello? Yes?
- He does not know a soul out there.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.506
So what the hell is he
coming out here for?

03:34.465 --> 03:36.426
I mean, I don't know what I can do for him,

03:36.593 --> 03:38.761
meanwhile this call is
costing you a fortune.

03:39.429 --> 03:40.263
Look...

03:40.471 --> 03:41.681
I gotta go.

03:42.265 --> 03:45.059
Ginger Rogers is trying
to get in touch with me.

03:45.810 --> 03:48.271
Two weeks later, a cab
from the train station

03:48.438 --> 03:51.733
pulls up in Hollywood
at the Ali Baba Motel.

03:51.900 --> 03:56.154
And emerging from it was a young man
hoping to make a life for himself.

03:56.487 --> 03:59.198
This was Robert Jacob Dorfman.

03:59.365 --> 04:01.492
Bobby Dorfman, from the Bronx,

04:01.659 --> 04:04.162
away from home for the first time.

04:05.663 --> 04:08.041
The son of the poor jeweler, Marty Dorfman,

04:08.207 --> 04:10.084
and his beleaguered wife, Rose.

04:10.293 --> 04:14.047
His parents bickered on all
subjects, particularly Phil Stern.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.506
He's not a Jewish man...

04:15.673 --> 04:16.966
And what are you?

04:17.507 --> 04:18.927
You're no example.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.095
You don't prey, you don't fast...

04:21.262 --> 04:24.265
and you don't have a
traditional Jewish head.

04:25.224 --> 04:26.559
You're stupid!

04:27.435 --> 04:30.772
Then there was the middle sister
Evelyn, the school teacher...

04:31.147 --> 04:33.650
married to Leonard, the intellectual,

04:33.816 --> 04:36.110
the professor, the Communist.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.780
"Religion is the opium of the people."

04:38.947 --> 04:41.074
A ponderer of big questions.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.241
A mench,

04:42.408 --> 04:44.744
A match made in heaven for Evelyn.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.873
Finally there was the eldest brother, Ben.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.751
Simply put, Ben was a gangster.

04:51.918 --> 04:52.961
Bobby loved his brother

04:53.127 --> 04:57.131
and chose to see Ben's livelihood
as the restaurant supply business.

04:57.298 --> 05:00.259
But while Ben serviced
bars and nightclubs...

05:00.635 --> 05:02.804
there was a darker aspect to his life.

05:07.600 --> 05:11.312
And so, on a sun drenched
day on Wilshire Boulevard,

05:11.479 --> 05:15.483
Bobby Dorfman approaches the
office of his Uncle Phil Stern.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.786
Hi, I'm here to see Phil Stern.

05:26.953 --> 05:28.746
- You have an appointment?
 - I do...

05:28.913 --> 05:30.999
I'm Bobby Dorfman, his nephew.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.126
He is actually in conference at the moment.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.877
Why don't you have a seat.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.603
Mr Dorfman?

05:53.604 --> 05:55.857
- Yes?
- Mr Stern will not be available today.

05:56.024 --> 05:58.067
There's a little bit of a
crisis that's come up.

05:58.234 --> 05:59.902
Can you come back Friday?

06:00.653 --> 06:02.196
Er, that's three days away.

06:02.363 --> 06:03.990
Yes, the 19th.

06:05.450 --> 06:06.367
Thank you.

06:21.090 --> 06:22.759
Always to Sid

06:26.012 --> 06:27.013
I'm sorry,

06:27.180 --> 06:29.307
Mr Stern had to leave for Acapulco.

06:29.474 --> 06:32.810
He said to tell you he had promised the
trip to his wife for her birthday.

06:33.019 --> 06:35.313
Christ, he went from Mexico
to Chicago on business

06:35.480 --> 06:37.607
I'm here 3 weeks, I can't get near him...

06:37.774 --> 06:41.027
It's M.G.M., it's Ginger
Rogers, it's Ronald Coleman...

06:41.486 --> 06:44.280
That's why Phil Stern is a big man.

06:44.489 --> 06:47.158
He'll be back so make the best of it.

06:47.575 --> 06:51.162
Here, your brother, he came
over for potato pancakes.

06:51.329 --> 06:52.538
Take the phone.

06:53.539 --> 06:55.291
Hey pal, you bored already?

06:55.458 --> 06:57.585
I was there for 3 weeks,
that's why I never go back.

06:58.002 --> 07:01.214
It's sunny and warm but it's not New York.
I don't know anybody here.

07:01.380 --> 07:05.134
here they call danish "sweet rolls" and
they give you coffee before you eat...

07:05.301 --> 07:08.554
the minute you sit down, even
before the orange juice.

07:08.888 --> 07:11.099
Let me give you some phone numbers.
Ok hang on...

07:12.934 --> 07:15.603
Toni White, Klondike 0079.

07:15.770 --> 07:17.396
She knows lots of girls.

07:17.563 --> 07:20.108
I know you're shy. You don't
have to make conversation...

07:20.274 --> 07:21.526
Just pay em' $20 bucks.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.361
She knows some beauts.

07:23.528 --> 07:27.240
Hey, I'm not paying for it. There's nothing
sexy about a commercial transaction.

07:27.406 --> 07:31.202
You're right kid, its the worst but
some nights it's the only game in town.

07:31.369 --> 07:32.411
Good bye.

07:33.412 --> 07:34.747
He's a good kid, he'll do ok.

07:34.914 --> 07:38.042
Meanwhile her phoney brother
is giving him the runaround.

07:38.209 --> 07:39.544
He is busy!

07:39.877 --> 07:43.005
You don't know what is is to be busy!

07:43.214 --> 07:46.425
The man eats with Fred
Astaire and Gary Cooper.

07:46.592 --> 07:47.885
I'm impressed.

07:48.094 --> 07:48.845
Here.

07:49.220 --> 07:51.264
Good pancakes. Buy yourself a hat.

07:51.430 --> 07:52.473
What's this?

07:54.058 --> 07:55.184
1500$ ?

07:55.351 --> 07:57.395
So go to Florida a few days.

07:58.563 --> 08:02.567
I don't want this money if
it came from anything fishy.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.860
My partner and I might buy a nightclub.
Would it make

08:04.885 --> 08:06.970
you feel better if I was
in the nightclub business?

08:07.780 --> 08:10.449
As long as it's all above board.

08:10.616 --> 08:13.286
- When will you know?
- We have to see if the owner will sell.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.212
We're trying to persuade him.

08:30.970 --> 08:33.431
If you ask politely, people listen.

08:36.350 --> 08:39.020
I'm at the Ali Baba Motel,

08:39.187 --> 08:40.938
it's on Grace and Yucca...

08:42.315 --> 08:45.318
It's room 222, I'm Bobby Dorfman, so...

08:45.610 --> 08:46.777
10.15?

08:48.154 --> 08:49.780
That seems fine, 10.15.

08:50.281 --> 08:51.532
No, I don't care...
No, of course not...

08:51.699 --> 08:54.160
Blond, brunette ... whatever.

08:54.911 --> 08:56.204
Great. I'll be waiting.

09:20.186 --> 09:21.354
This is the room you want.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.147
Your dig got my room by mistake.

09:23.314 --> 09:24.398
Oh God, oh sorry!

09:24.565 --> 09:26.692
Hi, come on in. Sorry, sorry...

09:28.402 --> 09:29.695
Jesus. What the hell did you do?

09:29.862 --> 09:31.239
I'm sorry, I wrote it down wrong.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.574
I live here so now everybody has to know.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.369
- Do I look like a working girl?
- Look at yourself, are you kidding me?

09:36.535 --> 09:38.287
Where were you ? I'm ready to go to sleep.

09:38.454 --> 09:41.707
I know, I know my car got a flat. I'm
sorry I'm late. My name's Candy.

09:41.874 --> 09:44.043
You're late, you get the wrong room ...

09:44.752 --> 09:45.711
I could use one.

09:46.379 --> 09:47.213
Yeah? Fine help yourself.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.423
You know, I do not usually do this.

09:50.216 --> 09:52.051
Oh, can I let you in on a secret?

09:52.426 --> 09:55.721
I've never taken money before
so we're both in the same boat.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.932
What are you saying,
this is your first job?

09:58.766 --> 09:59.475
It is...

09:59.684 --> 10:01.394
so if I seem a little disorganized...

10:01.560 --> 10:03.688
My god. Tony sent you over here
and you're not even a real pro.

10:03.854 --> 10:04.981
Not yet.

10:06.148 --> 10:08.776
You don't have any qualms
about going down this road?

10:09.026 --> 10:10.319
I need a job.

10:10.486 --> 10:12.321
My acting career is not going anywhere...

10:12.530 --> 10:14.615
Ok, but think.

10:15.157 --> 10:16.325
I need the money.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.494
You know what...

10:18.744 --> 10:20.830
You don't have to sleep with me
but I'll give you the money.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.290
No it's ok. I've
made up my mind.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.709
I don't want it on my conscience,
it's too much for me.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.294
It's alright, I'm willing.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.838
Willing? thank you very
much, like taking medicine?

10:29.005 --> 10:31.507
No, you're not some big fat schiener.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.801
Hey look, you're nervous and
now you're making me nervous.

10:33.968 --> 10:36.804
I'm not nervous to go to bed. I actually
just got out of a pretty hot romance...

10:36.971 --> 10:38.848
But I've never paid anyone
to do it with me before.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.183
Incidentally I need the $20 in advance.

10:41.434 --> 10:43.978
There's nothing sexy about the two
of us going through the motions...

10:44.145 --> 10:45.646
Take the money and go.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.232
Don't you want to try me?

10:48.441 --> 10:52.194
I'm so lonely I would have been happy just
to talk but now I'm too tired for that.

10:52.737 --> 10:54.030
Am I not attractive?

10:54.572 --> 10:56.657
You're ok, you're fine,
it's me I have a headache.

10:57.575 --> 11:00.494
This town is full of
fantastic looking girls.

11:00.828 --> 11:03.539
They come from all over looking
to get into the movies.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.876
So you don't want to
go to bed with me?

11:07.835 --> 11:11.047
I'm not in the mood, sorry.
I lost it.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.341
Oh Jesus, don't cry.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.469
Come on, if it's going
to kill you we'll do it.

11:16.635 --> 11:18.512
All I ask is that we
turn the lights out.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.348
I got a feeling this line of work
is not really right for you.

11:20.514 --> 11:21.140
Hey look...

11:21.557 --> 11:22.808
I came over here a little late...

11:23.017 --> 11:24.852
but now it's you that's backing down.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.813
Because you're making me tense. Give
me the bottle I need another drink.

11:28.022 --> 11:30.066
Maybe if we just took our
clothes off and got into bed.

11:30.483 --> 11:33.319
No I can't, it's too mechanical.
Here, just take the $20.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.696
Forget it, I'll go. I'm sorry
I screwed everything up.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.908
I'm sorry too. I should never have
started this, it's not really my style.

11:39.075 --> 11:42.453
Don't be upset. It has nothing to do with
your looks. Don't take it personally.

11:43.371 --> 11:47.041
- You don't want to do it?
- If it's so important to you we'll do it!

11:47.208 --> 11:48.209
Come on. We'll do it. Let's go.

11:49.418 --> 11:50.127
Come on.

11:52.588 --> 11:53.881
Here, take the money.

11:56.258 --> 11:57.885
So what is your name, Cindy?

11:58.719 --> 11:59.553
It's Candy.

12:00.471 --> 12:01.305
Candy?

12:01.847 --> 12:03.891
Is that a real name? What is that?
Candice?

12:04.058 --> 12:06.102
No, not really...

12:06.268 --> 12:08.187
But it's a sexy name don't you think?

12:08.354 --> 12:09.397
It's ok.

12:11.023 --> 12:12.650
My real name is Shirley.

12:13.401 --> 12:14.902
Shirley Garfein.

12:16.070 --> 12:17.279
You're a Jew?

12:18.322 --> 12:19.573
Yeah, so?

12:19.740 --> 12:21.575
A Jewish hooker. Is this a first?

12:22.118 --> 12:24.453
Don't act so shocked. I'm not
going to make a career of it.

12:24.620 --> 12:27.373
Take the $20 and go. Please go.

12:27.540 --> 12:29.041
Oh no, what's wrong?

12:29.208 --> 12:30.709
Nothing, I just, can't....

12:31.544 --> 12:33.170
Please? Are you sure?

12:33.337 --> 12:36.841
I'm very sure. It was nice to meet you.
Please don't talk to anyone on the way out.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.884
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

12:40.428 --> 12:41.804
It's just down this hall.

12:47.977 --> 12:48.978
Come in! Come in!

12:49.854 --> 12:51.689
Sorry I've been so hard to get to.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.358
I've been going through all this
Howard Hawks thing at Chicago.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.277
That's okay, Uncle Phil.

12:57.528 --> 12:58.195
Sit.

13:02.324 --> 13:03.284
So...

13:03.993 --> 13:05.244
what's the story?

13:05.744 --> 13:07.621
Rose tells me you want to live out here?

13:07.955 --> 13:08.622
Yes.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.417
I could not go on in my
father's business...

13:11.584 --> 13:14.378
It was stultifying. I want to do
something more interesting with my life.

13:17.506 --> 13:18.507
Hello? Hi Paul.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.677
Yeah it's a mess down there. Adolphe Menjou
is threatening to walk off the picture.

13:22.011 --> 13:25.097
I'll give you the details Friday.
You'll be at the poker game, right?

13:25.347 --> 13:26.599
Alright, we'll talk then.

13:28.392 --> 13:29.477
I'm tied up right now.

13:29.643 --> 13:30.478
Great.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.025
You can't believe the
last couple of weeks...

13:37.693 --> 13:40.362
Christ, it's all about ego.
This town runs on ego.

13:40.613 --> 13:43.240
I'm Bobby. Ben is my brother
though, so it's understandable.

13:43.491 --> 13:44.700
So, what the hell...

13:44.867 --> 13:46.285
What can I do for you?

13:46.452 --> 13:47.369
Hold on...

13:49.079 --> 13:50.289
Oh Jesus what?

13:51.332 --> 13:53.083
Absolutely. Yes.

13:53.709 --> 13:55.586
Lunch on Friday at the Brown Derby.

13:56.921 --> 14:00.549
And bring Harry because I agree Joel McCrea
would be perfect to play the lead.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.426
Absolutely, see you Friday.

14:02.593 --> 14:05.346
And don't disappoint me by
canceling with some phoney excuse.

14:05.721 --> 14:08.182
What do you think of Joel McCrea?

14:10.768 --> 14:12.728
I think he's a great movie star.

14:12.937 --> 14:16.273
What I like about Joel is he can play
drama and give me the light touch...

14:16.440 --> 14:17.983
Great range...

14:21.695 --> 14:24.490
So? What are you plans? Are you
planning on staying out here?

14:25.199 --> 14:29.119
I thought if you know of something I can get
started with? Something at your agency?

14:29.578 --> 14:30.955
Here, like what?

14:31.288 --> 14:32.456
I don't know. Like something...

14:32.623 --> 14:34.959
I kind of need a job.

14:35.292 --> 14:38.420
We have nothing here at the moment, if
you're talking about the mail room.

14:38.754 --> 14:40.589
The mail room? Yeah...

14:41.048 --> 14:43.175
Sure, something to begin with.

14:43.342 --> 14:45.344
If something comes in the mail
room I could let you know.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.596
There is nothing here now then?

14:47.930 --> 14:49.056
Unless...

14:49.723 --> 14:51.350
I put you on working for me.

14:53.185 --> 14:55.354
We can come up with some title...

14:55.938 --> 14:57.439
I always have some errands to run...

14:57.606 --> 14:58.983
I'll do anything.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.484
You know anybody in town?

15:01.277 --> 15:02.361
No, I don't.

15:02.528 --> 15:04.280
Hotel life is the worst right?

15:05.030 --> 15:06.991
Karen and I will invite
you over for dinner...

15:07.157 --> 15:08.867
we have these parties...

15:09.410 --> 15:12.288
Sunday brunches, we'll invite you.
You'll meet some nice people.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.081
Vonnie, come in here can you?

15:14.415 --> 15:16.917
Check in with me each day and I'll
have some odd jobs for you to do.

15:17.418 --> 15:19.169
This is so nice of you Uncle Phil.

15:19.420 --> 15:21.005
Stop with the "Uncle". It's Phil.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.840
We don’t want to over
emphasis the nepotism.

15:26.468 --> 15:27.428
Bobby. This is my nephew.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.513
He just moved out here...

15:29.972 --> 15:32.474
Maybe you could help get him orientated.

15:32.641 --> 15:33.976
Show him the town.
Right now he's at sea.

15:34.310 --> 15:35.477
Absolutely.

15:36.270 --> 15:38.272
Anytime this weekend?
Are you free Saturday?

15:38.439 --> 15:39.982
Yes, great.

15:40.316 --> 15:42.151
Fantastic. Very nice to meet you.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.446
When you leave I'll get your information.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.164
She looks nice.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.500
Dear Evelyn, just a note to say hello.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.670
I'd call more frequently but between
Mom and Dad and you and Ben...

16:01.837 --> 16:04.340
the long distance calls are
probably bankrupting everybody.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.425
Ben sent me a few bucks so I'm managing.

16:06.592 --> 16:07.676
I gotta job with Uncle Phil...

16:07.843 --> 16:12.306
not much of a job but he's going to have me
to dinner and introduce me to some contacts.

16:12.473 --> 16:15.351
His secretary is going to
show me around this weekend.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.102
She is very pretty.

16:17.811 --> 16:18.937
Dear Bobby,

16:19.104 --> 16:20.564
It's raining here today.

16:20.731 --> 16:23.067
Very pretty, but a bit melancholy.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.694
Leonard says it's the poignancy of life:

16:25.861 --> 16:28.781
and not only do we have to
embrace it's meaninglessness...

16:28.947 --> 16:31.659
but celebrate life because
it has no meaning.

16:31.825 --> 16:35.704
It's too deep for me but Mom
always boils it down to...

16:35.871 --> 16:38.040
"Live every day like it's your last.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.042
"And someday you'll be right."

16:50.219 --> 16:52.388
- Thank you very much for driving.
- Of course.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.892
- So?
- So...

16:58.644 --> 16:59.478
So where shall we start?

16:59.645 --> 17:03.315
The Beverly Hills homes? The
fancy-smancy movie stars homes?

17:03.482 --> 17:04.775
Great. I'm game.

17:05.776 --> 17:07.736
This is Spencer Tracy's house.

17:08.737 --> 17:11.031
I think it's one of the prettiest ones.
It's not all done up.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.574
And wait, who is that one?

17:12.741 --> 17:13.575
I don't know.

17:14.410 --> 17:15.868
A little pretentious
though, don't you think?

17:16.036 --> 17:17.037
Is it?

17:17.329 --> 17:19.665
To me these all seem like the Taj Mahal.

17:20.249 --> 17:21.541
I know the feeling.

17:23.419 --> 17:25.921
And here is where Joan Crawford lives.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.382
It takes your breath away.
Look at that car.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.552
- You know I met Miss Crawford once?
- Really?

17:31.719 --> 17:33.429
She is a client of your Uncle's.

17:33.595 --> 17:35.597
- What is she like?
- Beautiful.

17:35.764 --> 17:38.892
You really knew why she was a movie star.
She was larger than life.

17:39.059 --> 17:42.896
I can not imagine what it would
be like to be larger than life.

17:43.439 --> 17:45.232
Sure it would be fun for a while...

17:46.442 --> 17:48.527
I think I'd be happier being life sized.

17:53.741 --> 17:55.743
This is Robert Taylor's house.

17:56.034 --> 17:58.954
If you could choose one house
to live in on the block...

17:59.121 --> 18:00.414
which would you pick?

18:03.542 --> 18:05.502
I don't think I would choose Beverly Hills.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.129
Why not ?

18:07.296 --> 18:09.339
I love living by the beach, you know...

18:09.506 --> 18:13.218
My apartment is just a short ride from the
ocean. I get to stare at it all day...

18:14.928 --> 18:19.475
I feel sorry for these people, needing
to feel important in these big houses.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.644
I talk like this now...

18:22.811 --> 18:25.439
I'm the same as every other girl in town
with all the same ambitions, but...

18:25.606 --> 18:27.691
You wanted to be a movie star?

18:27.858 --> 18:29.276
I liked acting.

18:29.443 --> 18:30.277
In school.

18:30.444 --> 18:31.612
Where was school?

18:32.279 --> 18:33.489
Nebraska.

18:34.573 --> 18:37.826
I thought I'd come to Hollywood and live in one
of these big houses with a swimming pool...

18:37.993 --> 18:40.037
hob-knob with all the glamorous types.

18:40.454 --> 18:41.830
Go to openings...

18:42.748 --> 18:44.666
You grow up and...

18:44.833 --> 18:48.212
quickly realize if you have half a
brain what a silly life that can be.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.090
Lovely, charming,

18:52.257 --> 18:55.385
and uncorrupted by the
values of a seductive city,

18:55.552 --> 18:58.347
that worshiped fame and box-office records,

18:58.514 --> 19:00.015
Vonnie enchanted him,

19:00.182 --> 19:03.519
although he was too scared to
ask if she had a boyfriend.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.897
To quote his brother,
the great philosopher:

19:07.064 --> 19:10.442
"Some questions you don't
wanna know the answers to."

19:11.026 --> 19:14.863
Meanwhile, he labored at the trivial
errands his Uncle had him doing.

19:15.030 --> 19:18.742
and it was only the thought that she
was free again the following Saturday

19:18.909 --> 19:20.118
and he could see her...

19:20.285 --> 19:22.538
that gave him something to look forward to.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.573
- Here you go two beers.
- Thank you sir.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.741
Wow that movie!

19:59.908 --> 20:01.952
- I loved it, did you like it?
- Yeah, of course.

20:02.119 --> 20:03.704
Barbara Stanwyckis really
one of my favorites.

20:03.871 --> 20:06.915
This place is great and you were not
kidding when you said it was a joint.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.042
It's not the Brown Derby or Chasen's,

20:09.209 --> 20:12.421
where you have to make an entrance
or sit at the right table...

20:12.588 --> 20:15.799
next to Mr. Goldwyn or James Cagney.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.759
Have you ever heard
 Mr. Goldwyn speak?

20:18.427 --> 20:20.012
He sounds like a comic.

20:20.178 --> 20:22.890
He's accent is extreme. It's hilarious.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.391
I didn't expect that.

20:26.184 --> 20:27.561
What are you thinking?

20:29.062 --> 20:30.105
Just that...

20:30.272 --> 20:31.815
you're very beautiful.

20:32.149 --> 20:33.025
Thank you.

20:36.194 --> 20:38.280
I don't think that a very
good idea actually...

20:39.323 --> 20:40.782
I'm seeing someone.

20:42.492 --> 20:43.535
Oh. What's he like?

20:44.161 --> 20:45.829
Doug is a journalist.

20:47.247 --> 20:50.167
I just thought, since you have
so much free time on your hands...

20:50.584 --> 20:52.502
He travels a lot.

20:53.170 --> 20:56.214
And I really like spending my
time with you if that's ok...

20:56.381 --> 20:58.926
You're very sweet. Have
you heard that before?

20:59.468 --> 21:03.430
You have this deer in
the headlights quality.

21:04.556 --> 21:05.474
Thank you.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.770
If I was your boyfriend,
I would not travel.

21:09.937 --> 21:12.189
Or if I did I would take you with me.

21:12.481 --> 21:14.900
I hope he knows how to kiss
you and all the rest...

21:16.902 --> 21:18.070
It's between us.

21:18.236 --> 21:20.113
I'm just looking out for
your best interests.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.823
- Thank you!
- I am.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.451
- What would I do without you ?
- I dunno.

21:33.710 --> 21:34.670
Honey!

21:35.337 --> 21:37.965
- You know Karen.
- Actually we never really met.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.675
Phil speaks very highly of you...

21:39.841 --> 21:42.719
He's been meaning to invite you to one
of our brunches for the longest time

21:42.886 --> 21:45.722
Thank you so much and I appreciate
everything he's done for me.

21:45.889 --> 21:48.016
I may have some good news for you...

21:48.183 --> 21:51.144
I thought I saw Joan Blondell here.
Is that possible?

21:51.311 --> 21:52.229
She's around here somewhere.

21:52.521 --> 21:55.190
I hear Louis is going
absolutely out of his mind...

21:55.357 --> 21:58.151
because his new picture is gonna bomb.

21:58.402 --> 22:00.862
Spencer is great. Spencer is always great.
Am I right?

22:01.029 --> 22:02.781
They'll never see their money back.

22:02.948 --> 22:04.866
Gentlemen, say hello to Bobby Dorfman.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.034
Hi, how are you?

22:06.201 --> 22:09.121
Mike was just saying what a bath M.G.M.'s
gonna take with their new film.

22:09.287 --> 22:11.123
Howard, Rad, Steve, come on over here!

22:11.289 --> 22:13.333
It's not the best news of your life?

22:13.875 --> 22:15.210
Howard Fox, Bobby Dorfman.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.878
Howard's a two time academy award winner.

22:17.045 --> 22:18.630
- Wow, congratulations!
- Thank you.

22:18.797 --> 22:20.757
If you've never heard of me I am writer.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.300
Rad Taylor, Bobby Dorfman.

22:22.467 --> 22:25.554
Rad and Steve are New
Yorkers, just like you.

22:25.721 --> 22:27.305
Steve runs our New York law firm.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.683
I do run their New York law firm

22:29.850 --> 22:31.727
but I have a question for you Phil...

22:31.893 --> 22:34.604
you said that during this trip I could
meet Greta Garbo. Where is she?

22:34.771 --> 22:35.897
Oh, she's impossible.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.150
She's alone somewhere,
there's where she is!

22:38.316 --> 22:40.861
- Bobby, who would you like to meet?
- Er, Babe Ruth.

22:41.028 --> 22:41.987
Present company excepted.

22:42.696 --> 22:45.532
I don't care how many men she sleeps
with, she'll never get that part.

22:45.699 --> 22:47.117
Have you seen her in a bathing suit?

22:47.284 --> 22:50.829
Huge thighs. Not M.G.M.thighs.

22:51.955 --> 22:55.584
It is your faithful Hollywood reporter
calling like he said he would...

22:56.418 --> 22:57.753
Yes, yes it's me.

22:57.919 --> 23:01.465
I think you're actually lucky that your boss
doesn't invite you to these things...

23:01.631 --> 23:03.842
It is everything that
you can't stand, its...

23:04.009 --> 23:08.055
all industry talk and name
dropping and catty backstabbing.

23:09.097 --> 23:12.017
Yeah but there are a few faces that
you'd recognize from the screen.

23:12.184 --> 23:13.018
Oh, me ?

23:13.185 --> 23:15.562
I'm kinda half bored,
half fascinated, I'm...

23:15.937 --> 23:20.567
I would trade it for Tacos with
you at that little Mexican joint.

23:21.610 --> 23:24.613
Yeah, I'm sure if you were here we'd
have a million wicked laughs together.

23:25.864 --> 23:27.449
Yeah but, no of course, go...

23:27.949 --> 23:29.743
No, no. I will speak to you later.

23:44.091 --> 23:45.926
If you look closely I'm in there.

23:46.093 --> 23:49.930
These photos are incredible. I
recognize so many famous faces.

23:50.097 --> 23:52.724
Keep going until you get
to a unknown 10 year old.

23:53.475 --> 23:54.601
What? No, is this you?

23:54.768 --> 23:56.853
That's me, right next to DW Griffith.

23:57.020 --> 23:58.230
Oh my goodness!

23:58.396 --> 24:01.691
I grew up in this town but thank god
I married a confirmed New Yorker.

24:01.858 --> 24:04.319
Oh yeah, that's right.
What do you do there?

24:04.486 --> 24:06.071
I run a modeling agency.

24:06.238 --> 24:06.947
Oh really?

24:07.114 --> 24:09.991
Are there are more beautiful
girls in Hollywood or New York?

24:10.158 --> 24:12.327
Why? Is that how you'll
decide where you'll live?

24:12.494 --> 24:14.704
No, I'm just curious.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.498
There's more out here.

24:16.665 --> 24:19.668
I'm sure you'll have no trouble
finding suitable companionship.

24:19.835 --> 24:23.171
Unfortunately the most beautiful woman
I've met out here already has a boyfriend.

24:23.338 --> 24:24.339
That's life!

24:24.548 --> 24:26.675
That's why Rodgers & Hart get rich.

24:26.842 --> 24:30.345
Sorry, I think I'm a little drunk. I've
never mixed champagne and bagels before.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.888
Welcome to Hollywood.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.473
What do you do?

24:33.640 --> 24:37.310
Menial errands are my specialty but
I don't see a big future in it.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.147
- We met down stairs.
- Absolutely.

24:40.313 --> 24:43.650
he's a fellow New Yorker suffering
from unrequited love...

24:45.569 --> 24:49.114
Oh no. Unrequited love kills more
people per year than tuberculosis.

24:49.281 --> 24:50.282
I believe you!

24:50.448 --> 24:52.200
- I'm kidding!
- I know, but it sounds...

24:52.367 --> 24:55.579
If you ever find yourself back in New
York and you're still broken hearted...

24:55.745 --> 24:59.624
call us and I will introduce you to any
number of eligible young goddesses...

24:59.791 --> 25:01.918
who, believe me, are
just as lonely as you...

25:02.085 --> 25:03.795
despite their fabulous measurements!

25:03.962 --> 25:06.214
Thank you, maybe I'll take you up on that.

25:06.381 --> 25:09.384
Listen Bobby, If you're bored out here we
can always invite you to a screening of...

25:09.551 --> 25:13.013
a new film I've wisely
invested in last week.

25:13.180 --> 25:13.847
Really? I would love to go.

25:14.014 --> 25:15.724
- Does that sound good?
- Yes, of course. thank you so much.

25:15.891 --> 25:18.894
Bring your girlfriend if you can
pry her loose from her lover!

25:20.187 --> 25:22.397
There you are! I was looking for you.

25:22.898 --> 25:24.524
I have some good news.

25:27.944 --> 25:28.945
Vonnie...

25:30.030 --> 25:31.406
Hi. You free tonight ?

25:31.573 --> 25:32.574
I'm not.

25:33.241 --> 25:35.285
You sure? I was hoping to
take you out to celebrate.

25:35.452 --> 25:37.329
- Celebrate what?
- I got a promotion.

25:37.495 --> 25:40.081
And a raise. I'm going
to be reading scripts.

25:40.248 --> 25:41.833
That is fantastic!

25:42.417 --> 25:43.627
I'm so happy for you!

25:43.793 --> 25:46.838
I was hoping to take you to a screening.
I got invited by...

25:47.005 --> 25:48.256
some big producer.

25:48.423 --> 25:49.466
Can I take a rain check?

25:49.633 --> 25:52.594
Yes! Of course, but I was
hoping to buy you champagne.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.013
How about dinner on...

25:55.180 --> 25:56.056
Wednesday?

25:56.223 --> 25:57.390
Yes Ok...

25:57.766 --> 25:58.808
Dinner it is.

25:58.975 --> 26:00.810
I'll take you someplace very fancy.

26:01.102 --> 26:04.731
I will have to get all dressed up...

26:05.023 --> 26:07.108
maybe we can stay at your place?
And I can cook for us.

26:08.026 --> 26:09.236
You cook?

26:10.278 --> 26:13.031
I don't make pheasant or souffle
or anything like that, but ...

26:13.198 --> 26:15.450
I can manage spaghetti and meatballs?

26:15.617 --> 26:17.285
Yes, that's great.

26:17.661 --> 26:19.788
You can play me those Jazz records
I've been dying to hear...

26:19.955 --> 26:22.123
My mother cooks spaghetti and meatballs...

26:22.290 --> 26:24.292
but when a Jew cooks something
it's always overcooked.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.544
they wanna make sure to
kill all the germs, so...

26:26.711 --> 26:28.505
I think I'll prefer yours!

26:29.297 --> 26:33.218
It was his first experience of a private
screening in a producers home...

26:33.385 --> 26:34.636
and it was a good movie.

26:34.803 --> 26:37.847
And he wished Vonnie could have
been there with him to share it.

26:38.348 --> 26:41.810
But she had warned him from the
start she had a boyfriend.

27:08.420 --> 27:11.589
Sorry I'm late. There was
traffic, can you believe it?

27:11.756 --> 27:14.926
Late or on time you always
look beautiful to me.

27:15.844 --> 27:17.429
Could I have a white wine please?

27:17.595 --> 27:19.514
I'm sure it's just the candlelight.

27:20.849 --> 27:22.350
I've made up my mind...

27:23.685 --> 27:27.063
I'm going to have a talk with Karen as
soon as she gets back from Toronto.

27:27.230 --> 27:29.024
Her Mother is much better.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.114
Are you sure this is what you want?

27:36.698 --> 27:38.616
I can't go on sneaking around...

27:38.783 --> 27:42.454
grabbing moments with you
in hotel rooms and dark bars.

27:42.954 --> 27:44.372
I'm in love with you.

27:45.957 --> 27:49.586
You've been saying that, I just don’t
want to feel that I've broken up...

27:49.753 --> 27:51.046
your marriage.

27:52.630 --> 27:53.923
I want to be honest,

27:54.257 --> 27:57.761
Karen and I have a long
history and not a bad one.

27:57.927 --> 28:00.638
Would I walk out on her
if I hadn't met you?

28:00.805 --> 28:02.223
Probably not.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.351
But I did meet you.

28:05.769 --> 28:09.898
Of course I want to be with you.
I just hate the duplicity of this.

28:10.357 --> 28:12.984
I know. It's not fair for you to live this.

28:13.568 --> 28:15.528
You've been  so understanding about it.

28:15.695 --> 28:17.572
Too understanding, really.

28:20.325 --> 28:21.701
I love you, Vonnie.

28:23.745 --> 28:26.748
Oh, my heart beats faster
when you say that to me.

28:27.749 --> 28:30.085
Looks like my hope not anxiety.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.420
Yes, with excitement.

28:33.254 --> 28:34.839
I'm excited.

28:37.092 --> 28:38.551
Dare I kiss you?

28:41.054 --> 28:42.430
I dare you not.

28:48.561 --> 28:49.729
Dear Bobby,

28:49.896 --> 28:52.816
I understand you met some
girl you're crazy about.

28:52.982 --> 28:56.069
Your last letter said she had a boyfriend.
A journalist.

28:56.236 --> 28:58.279
My advice is to not give up.

28:58.446 --> 29:00.990
Send her some flowers and keep trying.

29:01.157 --> 29:05.787
You said she's not the type that gets impressed
with presents but women appreciate little gifts.

29:05.954 --> 29:07.789
Just a word to the wise...

29:07.997 --> 29:11.418
As for Ben, he's getting involved
in the nightclub business.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.962
What does he know of running a club?

29:14.254 --> 29:18.925
He's up to his neck in Union problems but
so far he's been able to deal with them.

29:28.351 --> 29:30.687
Ben Dorfman, Benny to his friends.

29:30.854 --> 29:33.398
Ten typewriters were
stolen over the weekend!

29:33.565 --> 29:37.444
He was always in trouble with the Law,
even going back to school days.

29:37.944 --> 29:41.281
He grew up in a Jewish neighborhood and
most of the kids got educations...

29:41.448 --> 29:43.658
and lots of them became doctors or lawyers.

29:43.825 --> 29:46.911
But not all. Some were tough
Jews and picked the streets.

29:47.078 --> 29:49.581
Harry Cantor owes me $ 6,000.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.000
Collect if for me, I'll give you a third.

29:52.167 --> 29:56.004
You do it this week, I'll take you
to Duffinetti's for a nice steak.

29:56.838 --> 30:00.842
He wasn't going to struggle like his father
going from one menial job to another.

30:01.009 --> 30:05.096
His friend Abe got 20 cents an hour
for lugging big crates of stationary.

30:05.263 --> 30:09.517
He got $50 for fixing up some
furs in the garment district.

30:10.143 --> 30:12.770
Tony Rondalino taught them
to hold up craps games.

30:12.937 --> 30:16.316
The games were illegal and when he took
the money they couldn't go to the cops.

30:16.483 --> 30:18.610
He split the money with Tony.

30:19.861 --> 30:22.197
One night he was sitting
in his car with Tony.

30:22.363 --> 30:24.115
He had enough to buy a car.

30:24.282 --> 30:26.409
A guy came up, calm as can be...

30:26.576 --> 30:29.287
put his gun through the
window and killed Tony.

30:29.621 --> 30:32.540
Education in the streets came violently.

30:32.707 --> 30:35.251
Now he and his partners
owned the club Hangover.

30:35.418 --> 30:37.045
He wore expensive suits...

30:37.212 --> 30:41.132
but under those suits he was
still Benny from the streets.

30:44.219 --> 30:45.553
Have a good trip.

30:45.720 --> 30:48.515
I envy you. I miss New
York so much right now.

30:49.390 --> 30:52.644
My business can't be without me for
too long or everyone falls apart.

30:52.810 --> 30:53.478
I'm sure they do.

30:53.645 --> 30:55.146
Good luck with everything.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.149
Thank you. She's coming over
to cook spaghetti this week.

30:58.316 --> 30:59.734
I keep deluding myself...

30:59.901 --> 31:03.029
If only I had the right wine,
music, candlelight ...

31:03.196 --> 31:06.074
Take it from me, she likes you if
she spends so much time with you.

31:06.241 --> 31:07.825
Steve and I are rooting for you.

31:07.992 --> 31:09.994
- Stay in touch.
- You too.

31:34.102 --> 31:36.980
Bobby, I want to tell you
that I can't make it tonight.

31:37.730 --> 31:41.442
Something came up. It's an emergency.
I have to reschedule.

31:43.361 --> 31:47.323
But I've laid everything out. I've
opened the wine to let it breathe.

31:48.116 --> 31:50.994
Can I make it up to you?
I promise I will.

32:32.452 --> 32:34.621
I got you an
anniversary present...

32:36.039 --> 32:36.956
Look...

32:38.625 --> 32:40.877
It's a letter written and signed

32:41.044 --> 32:42.670
by Rudolph Valentino.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.049
It's paper.

32:46.257 --> 32:48.468
Our first year is paper, so...

32:49.510 --> 32:52.513
I found this amazing memorabilia shop.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.808
I can't do it, Vonnie.

32:58.436 --> 32:59.479
Can't do what?

33:01.397 --> 33:02.774
I can't leave Karen.

33:07.904 --> 33:09.739
It was your idea...

33:09.906 --> 33:11.616
I can't see you anymore.

33:18.331 --> 33:19.874
This is putting me in an early grave.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.377
I thought I could tell her...

33:22.543 --> 33:25.963
But Christ, we've been married
for 25 years, we have kids.

33:28.591 --> 33:30.093
You don't owe me any explanation.

33:30.259 --> 33:33.346
I can't lead a double life.
It's not fair to you.

33:33.513 --> 33:35.556
Or to Karen or to myself.

33:35.723 --> 33:36.933
Okay.

33:37.850 --> 33:40.395
It's not that I do not love you ...

33:40.812 --> 33:43.147
It's just the situation is too difficult.

33:46.609 --> 33:48.403
And it's pointless to move on...

33:49.404 --> 33:51.989
I understand. That's what you
were going to say, right?

33:54.117 --> 33:55.702
Something like that.

33:57.662 --> 33:59.205
Look, I know ...

33:59.497 --> 34:01.624
that we can't just both...

34:02.709 --> 34:04.085
forget that this happened.

34:06.504 --> 34:09.172
Your secret is safe with me if
that's what your worried about?

34:09.340 --> 34:11.175
I would never tell anyone.

34:25.148 --> 34:26.315
Oh my gosh! Are you okay?

34:26.482 --> 34:28.234
I'm probably too late for dinner, right?

34:28.400 --> 34:29.277
Dinner? Well...

34:30.152 --> 34:30.862
Are you OK?

34:31.279 --> 34:33.906
I do not want to impose on you like this...

34:34.072 --> 34:36.868
It's not an imposition. What's wrong?

34:37.034 --> 34:38.703
I can't stop crying. This is so stupid.

34:38.870 --> 34:40.079
Tell me what happened.

34:41.748 --> 34:43.791
My boyfriend just dumped me.

34:46.002 --> 34:48.254
Sorry.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.172
Yes, it's all over.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.592
I'm so sorry. What happened?

34:54.217 --> 34:58.264
I brought him an anniversary present. It
was our paper anniversary so one year.

34:59.474 --> 35:02.226
It was a Valentino letter.
It was beautiful...

35:02.393 --> 35:04.562
signed and written by Valentino.

35:04.729 --> 35:05.730
That is so nice.

35:05.897 --> 35:09.734
He can't leave his wife, I know that...

35:10.067 --> 35:13.112
- We can't go on like that forever.
- I didn't realize he was married.

35:14.739 --> 35:17.074
- Can we have a glass of white wine?
- Yes, of course.

35:17.241 --> 35:20.661
If it hasn't evaporated. It's
been breathing for hours.

35:21.078 --> 35:24.332
Sorry, that happens in this motel.
It should be over soon.

35:24.499 --> 35:27.251
I had never suspected he
was married, although...

35:27.418 --> 35:29.796
I am so slow to pick up on anything.

35:30.421 --> 35:33.674
That is one of your sweetest qualities.
You're very naive.

35:33.841 --> 35:34.801
Thank you.

35:35.051 --> 35:36.511
I guess you must have really loved him.

35:36.677 --> 35:38.429
He was very wonderful.

35:38.971 --> 35:39.972
I'm sure.

35:42.183 --> 35:43.518
I'll forget about it.

35:45.019 --> 35:46.604
I have to be honest...

35:48.272 --> 35:49.148
I'm of two minds...

35:49.315 --> 35:52.985
I feel sorry for you but I'm glad you
don't have a boyfriend anymore.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.112
But for selfish reasons.

35:56.864 --> 35:59.450
I've always known how
you've felt about me...

35:59.617 --> 36:01.118
and it's been flattering.

36:01.661 --> 36:04.463
I've been in love with you from the
first moment I laid my eyes on you...

36:04.330 --> 36:06.165
and I thought you were a movie star.

36:08.251 --> 36:10.127
Honestly I don't think I ever
want to fall in love again.

36:10.294 --> 36:12.505
It just happened, you need time.

36:12.964 --> 36:15.925
I'll get over it. I'm not usually
such a fragile person...

36:16.092 --> 36:19.095
but it took me by surprise. It really did.

36:19.387 --> 36:21.973
That is always the risk, when you get
involved with with a married man.

36:22.473 --> 36:24.016
That's what my roommate said.

36:24.183 --> 36:26.227
But he just over-whelmed me. He...

36:26.435 --> 36:28.437
is incredibly alive and...

36:29.146 --> 36:30.731
and very exciting.

36:31.148 --> 36:34.235
That's a very imaginative gift you
got for a paper anniversary...

36:34.402 --> 36:37.113
a love letter from Rudolph Valentino.
That is very charming.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.614
I thought so.

36:39.031 --> 36:41.409
Maybe next year I'll be lucky enough
to get you a love letter from

36:41.576 --> 36:44.078
your favorite actress Barbara Stanwyck.

36:46.914 --> 36:48.124
It's sweet.

36:51.335 --> 36:55.089
Maybe Vonnie was heartbroken the way
things had turned out with the affair...

36:55.256 --> 36:57.633
but Bobby decidedly was not.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.261
He took it upon himself
with great pleasure...

37:00.428 --> 37:02.889
to try and help her forget
her former lover...

37:03.055 --> 37:04.807
and try she did.

37:05.141 --> 37:06.976
They spent weekends at the beach...

37:07.143 --> 37:09.186
and went to the movies almost every night.

37:09.353 --> 37:11.856
-" I'll be there".
-"You go right ahead, I trust you".

37:12.148 --> 37:15.484
They visited all the great
movie palaces in Hollywood...

37:15.651 --> 37:17.570
which were grand and beautiful,

37:17.737 --> 37:19.697
and not very expensive.

37:20.448 --> 37:21.866
And as time passed...

37:22.033 --> 37:26.787
Vonnie did start to succumb to
Bobby's charm and loving attention.

37:26.954 --> 37:30.917
And what began originally
as a casual friendship...

37:31.083 --> 37:34.045
blossomed into a genuine romance.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.809
Lets move to New York.

37:49.602 --> 37:50.603
What?

37:51.520 --> 37:54.440
What I'd really like to say is...marry
me and lets move to New York.

37:54.607 --> 37:57.610
We'll get a spot in Greenwich Village...

37:57.777 --> 38:00.404
I will find work there
and I'll spoil you...

38:01.364 --> 38:03.491
I think it would be great.
Look the truth is...

38:03.658 --> 38:06.410
I'm a little disillusioned
with the whole scene out here.

38:06.577 --> 38:10.831
I was like you, I dreamed of the house
and pool, the exciting movie stars but...

38:10.998 --> 38:15.127
but it is really kind of a boring,
nasty, dog eat dog industry.

38:15.294 --> 38:18.422
Come on, let's get married and move
to New York. It will be great.

38:19.090 --> 38:22.134
Greenwich Village, that's where all
the poets and painters live, right?

38:22.718 --> 38:25.930
I can't promise we'd ever be
rich but we'd have each other.

38:26.097 --> 38:28.432
And my brother Ben owns a nightclub.
He's asked me to help him run it.

38:28.599 --> 38:31.435
I don't know anything about
it but Ben's a great guy.

38:31.602 --> 38:33.104
And I'm a quick learner.

38:33.437 --> 38:36.107
And a nightclub's not like
working in some drab office.

38:36.273 --> 38:40.277
Let's face it, even though you had a boyfriend
you've had a feeling for me underneath.

38:40.736 --> 38:41.570
You have.

38:41.737 --> 38:44.031
We'd make a great team in New York.

38:47.284 --> 38:49.370
It sounds exciting, it really does.

38:50.871 --> 38:51.789
Yeah? Come here.

38:58.838 --> 39:01.882
Phil, what's wrong? You sounded
so upset on the telephone.

39:02.425 --> 39:03.509
You want a drink?

39:03.676 --> 39:05.761
No thank you. What's on your mind?

39:05.928 --> 39:07.179
Just let me...

39:11.308 --> 39:12.560
You alright?

39:13.352 --> 39:14.562
Why do you ask?

39:14.729 --> 39:17.606
Lately you've been smoking
more and drinking more.

39:17.773 --> 39:20.067
You're been a little crotchety at work.

39:21.152 --> 39:22.653
I'm not alright.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.489
I hope you are not ill.

39:27.158 --> 39:29.118
I need to talk, Bobby ...

39:30.536 --> 39:32.413
to somebody I trust.

39:34.248 --> 39:35.583
You can certainly talk to me...

39:35.750 --> 39:37.001
You're family.

39:38.002 --> 39:39.920
So what's the matter?

39:40.504 --> 39:42.965
I've decided I'm going to leave my wife.

39:46.302 --> 39:50.431
I've been back and forth about this decision
many times but the conclusion I've come to

39:50.639 --> 39:54.351
is I've fallen in love with another
woman and I can't live without her.

39:56.395 --> 40:00.107
I'm no expert in this area
but these things do happen.

40:00.274 --> 40:02.193
Not to me, they don't!

40:02.359 --> 40:03.652
I never cheated.

40:03.819 --> 40:06.197
Never looked at another woman in 25 years.

40:06.363 --> 40:08.616
Jesus, you know Karen, she's wonderful!

40:08.866 --> 40:09.950
She's wonderful!

40:10.493 --> 40:12.203
She is, I agree.

40:12.620 --> 40:14.246
And the a year ago...

40:14.413 --> 40:16.749
this dream, this angel ...

40:17.625 --> 40:19.251
dropped out of the sky.

40:19.668 --> 40:21.212
I became hooked.

40:22.129 --> 40:23.547
I know...

40:23.714 --> 40:27.259
but when it's right I
think you just know it.

40:27.468 --> 40:29.011
Yes, this is right!

40:30.054 --> 40:31.347
This is right!

40:31.514 --> 40:33.766
And this woman loves you I'm assuming?

40:33.933 --> 40:35.392
I believe that she does.

40:36.352 --> 40:38.687
Although I have jerked
her around for a year...

40:38.854 --> 40:41.315
telling her I was going to leave Karen...

40:41.482 --> 40:44.443
and then I couldn't and
then I would and I didn't.

40:44.693 --> 40:48.239
I can't tell her I'm going to
do it yet again and not...

40:48.405 --> 40:50.074
get her hopes up.

40:50.491 --> 40:52.576
I have to just do it. Hope
she hasn't met someone else.

40:53.035 --> 40:54.495
No, I'm sure if she really loves you...

40:54.745 --> 40:57.039
She is much younger than I am.

40:57.289 --> 40:59.875
So what is age? Nothing means
anything if your actually in love.

41:00.292 --> 41:04.547
I am so consumed with guilt over Karen because
she has done nothing to alienate me...

41:04.713 --> 41:07.883
She is bright and cheerful and loyal.

41:08.092 --> 41:10.219
- Her sex was always very good.
- Oh nice.

41:10.427 --> 41:12.388
But with this other woman, it's fantastic!

41:12.555 --> 41:13.973
Good, but ...

41:15.141 --> 41:17.685
people go through these things
and with time they come out ok.

41:17.852 --> 41:20.062
I'm sure she'll be fine.

41:21.313 --> 41:22.231
Yes.

41:22.565 --> 41:24.233
Karen will be well taken care of.

41:24.483 --> 41:26.735
Christ, she'll get half
of everything I'm worth!

41:27.319 --> 41:29.947
If there's anything I can
do for you...ever...

41:30.948 --> 41:32.741
I just wanted to talk.

41:33.200 --> 41:35.119
I've been carrying this knot
around in my chest for so long.

41:35.286 --> 41:39.165
Sorry you've been burdened with that.
You can always talk to me.

41:39.331 --> 41:40.249
Thanks.

41:43.419 --> 41:44.587
So is it true?

41:44.920 --> 41:46.505
Maybe getting a little homesick?

41:47.256 --> 41:52.094
Yes, I needed to move away from Manhattan
to realize what a New-Yorker I am at heart.

41:52.261 --> 41:53.345
Do you mind if I?...

41:55.389 --> 41:58.267
It's understandable. People
come out here all the time...

41:59.101 --> 42:00.436
and decide the life's not for them.

42:00.603 --> 42:02.563
You have a girl back in New York?

42:02.771 --> 42:05.900
I'm hoping I will and If I
have you can take 10% for it.

42:06.108 --> 42:07.276
For what?

42:07.568 --> 42:08.903
For introducing me to Vonnie.

42:09.111 --> 42:11.906
I think she's going to marry me
and move to Manhattan with me.

42:14.491 --> 42:17.578
Phil Stern could not believe
what he was hearing.

42:17.745 --> 42:20.623
He had worried Vonnie had
found someone else...

42:20.789 --> 42:23.292
but never dreamed it was his nephew.

42:23.584 --> 42:26.670
He had been taken with his new
secretary from that first day.

42:26.837 --> 42:27.963
Veronica Sybel.

42:28.130 --> 42:30.633
I have a masters degree in
English lit' and drama.

42:30.799 --> 42:32.551
And yes, I can type.

42:32.718 --> 42:34.511
He was smitten with her face,

42:34.678 --> 42:36.096
and she was captivated...

42:36.263 --> 42:39.600
by his charm and his take charge vitality.

42:39.975 --> 42:42.603
And over the next months
he overwhelmed her.

42:42.770 --> 42:44.146
And took risks doing it.

42:44.313 --> 42:46.482
I want to send fifty roses.

42:47.191 --> 42:48.943
That's fifty ...

42:49.610 --> 42:50.569
Fifty

42:50.736 --> 42:51.820
percent.

42:53.489 --> 42:55.491
Yes, fifty red roses.

42:55.824 --> 42:57.826
And I want the card to read...

42:58.827 --> 43:01.247
"Thanks for a fabulous weekend.

43:01.497 --> 43:05.000
"I told you you wouldn't
get seasick, with me there.

43:05.376 --> 43:07.211
"I love you. Philip."

43:07.753 --> 43:10.547
You know what? Make that
a hundred red roses.

43:35.781 --> 43:37.741
You are amazing.

43:38.784 --> 43:40.160
- No, you are.
- Thank you.

43:40.327 --> 43:41.704
I was in the moon.

43:43.372 --> 43:47.626
The thought of the two of us in
some great village apartment...

43:48.711 --> 43:50.713
Who would have thought when
I first came out here...

43:51.005 --> 43:51.714
I know.

43:51.880 --> 43:54.341
Everyone's lives are so unpredictable.

43:54.591 --> 43:55.634
It's funny,

43:55.801 --> 43:58.387
my Uncle Phil, your former employer,

43:58.679 --> 44:02.891
who's so dynamic and full of confidence
actually confided in me...

44:03.392 --> 44:06.186
He's been so hopelessly miserable lately.

44:06.353 --> 44:09.148
Apparently he's been having an affair with a
woman who he's very much in love with...

44:09.356 --> 44:12.568
But he's been having trouble
bringing himself to leave his wife.

44:12.818 --> 44:15.821
But apparently he is so in
love with this other person

44:15.988 --> 44:18.115
that he has decided to leave Karen...

44:18.282 --> 44:20.576
and plans to marry this other woman.

44:20.909 --> 44:23.037
He's been suffering so much

44:23.203 --> 44:27.374
because he likes and respects his wife but
he can not live without the other woman.

44:31.253 --> 44:33.589
I did not have the nerve to
ask if it was a movie star!

44:39.219 --> 44:41.930
- What's the matter?
- Is he leaving his wife...?

44:45.059 --> 44:48.354
He tried and backed down a
dozen times, but he said...

44:48.771 --> 44:51.940
he cannot live without this other
person. That's what he said.

44:52.274 --> 44:55.569
There is no question if you hear
him, he is very much in love.

44:56.320 --> 44:58.447
What are you thinking? You seem...

44:58.781 --> 44:59.865
so lost in thought.

45:00.032 --> 45:01.950
Sorry. No, nothing.

45:03.285 --> 45:04.745
What are you thinking about?

45:07.956 --> 45:08.791
Just, nothing.

45:09.625 --> 45:10.626
Oh no...

45:11.126 --> 45:14.838
I've made you nervous with my babbling about
about marriage and us moving to New York.

45:15.005 --> 45:16.006
That it ?

45:16.548 --> 45:17.591
That's it.

45:17.758 --> 45:19.176
That is quite a big thought.

45:19.343 --> 45:20.302
It is.

45:20.469 --> 45:21.470
Sorry.

45:40.989 --> 45:42.282
Thank you, have a wonderful night.

45:46.120 --> 45:49.415
Phil, we've been over this a million times.

45:49.706 --> 45:50.999
Things have changed.

45:51.166 --> 45:52.918
can we go someplace and talk?

45:53.085 --> 45:56.505
Where? Our usual dark bar? No,
absolutely not I work here.

45:56.672 --> 45:58.215
I told Karen.

45:58.841 --> 46:01.844
That was a little presumptuous given
the circumstances don't you think?

46:02.177 --> 46:03.387
What do you mean?

46:03.554 --> 46:06.682
Are you actually considering
moving to New York with my nephew?

46:06.932 --> 46:07.850
Do you know about that?

46:08.100 --> 46:08.976
Who told you?

46:09.143 --> 46:11.019
No secret is safe for
very long in this town.

46:11.311 --> 46:12.354
Ours was.

46:12.604 --> 46:14.189
Don't tell me you've changed your mind?

46:14.356 --> 46:15.566
Hi, Louis.

46:15.983 --> 46:19.445
- Any word on the MGM thing?
 - We should know by the end of the week.

46:25.367 --> 46:27.578
I love you. Is all that we
meant to each other nothing?

46:28.662 --> 46:32.583
I do not know what I think, I'm confused.
Can you blame me?

46:32.749 --> 46:33.500
No, I can't.

46:33.750 --> 46:35.377
And if you tell me to go
to hell I'll understand.

46:35.544 --> 46:38.005
I will kill myself but I'll
know where you're coming from.

46:38.380 --> 46:41.508
First you're leaving, then you're
not then you are then you can't.

46:41.675 --> 46:45.053
I never pushed you to leave her. In fact
I never even asked you to leave over me.

46:45.220 --> 46:46.722
And now you're here telling me you've left?

46:46.889 --> 46:48.182
What am I supposed to do with that?

46:48.348 --> 46:50.976
I know, I've been wishy-washy but
the thought of losing you ...

46:52.269 --> 46:54.313
It is a white ermine fur.

46:55.105 --> 46:58.734
Can you believe the studio requires
us to wear fur in this weather!

47:00.235 --> 47:02.488
- There you go.
- That's the one. Thank you.

47:02.905 --> 47:06.074
I understand that it hasn't been
easy but if it is so hard...

47:06.283 --> 47:07.326
why should we have to...

47:09.870 --> 47:11.830
You've never got back
to me about Bill Powell?

47:12.289 --> 47:14.583
- On what?
- William Powell, Paramount.

47:14.750 --> 47:18.045
I think he's going to pass but I'll
give him another call tomorrow.

47:19.254 --> 47:20.881
Vonnie, I don't want you working here.

47:21.048 --> 47:24.134
I want to marry you and take care
of you for the rest of your life.

47:24.301 --> 47:26.428
I can't believe you
cooled on me so quickly!

47:26.595 --> 47:28.764
And for Christ's sake with who?
My nephew?

47:28.931 --> 47:30.807
He's a nice kid but where
the hell's he going?

47:31.266 --> 47:35.020
You said it was possible yourself
to have feelings for two people.

47:35.562 --> 47:37.189
You love him too? I don't believe it.

47:37.397 --> 47:38.857
Believe it. I do.

47:39.066 --> 47:39.942
You love me.

47:40.526 --> 47:42.110
I do not know. I think so...

47:42.277 --> 47:44.404
I'm not sure. I'm very mixed up.

47:45.072 --> 47:47.366
- We on for lunch Thursday?
- Absolutely. Sure, sure.

47:47.533 --> 47:49.826
I'm gonna bring Judy Garland.
You'll love this kid.

47:49.993 --> 47:52.454
I think we could end up representing her.

47:52.621 --> 47:54.206
Really? Well ok, bring her along.

47:54.373 --> 47:57.000
I met Judy over at Billy Wilder's
dinner party so I know Judy.

47:57.167 --> 47:58.210
- See you Thursday.
- See you Thursday.

47:59.878 --> 48:01.838
I'm not going to stand here pleading.
I love you.

48:02.005 --> 48:04.466
I have loved you for over a year.

48:05.092 --> 48:07.761
I handled this as best I could.
maybe poorly at times.

48:07.928 --> 48:11.473
But of matters of the heart
people do foolish things.

48:12.516 --> 48:16.311
Think over my offer. I want
you to be my wife. Now.

48:16.937 --> 48:18.730
I will die if you say no.

48:19.815 --> 48:21.316
I'm going home to tell Karen.

48:21.608 --> 48:22.985
I thought you'd told Karen?

48:23.652 --> 48:28.031
I told her that I will be speaking about
a very serious matter this evening.

48:29.199 --> 48:32.077
Charlie, I need to talk to you
about that John Ford movie.

48:33.161 --> 48:34.788
Vonnie was perplexed.

48:34.955 --> 48:36.540
Two men were in love with her.

48:36.707 --> 48:39.334
One a dynamic and successful powerhouse...

48:39.501 --> 48:42.462
The other, a younger man
who clearly adored her.

48:42.629 --> 48:45.048
She shared her problem with
her roommate, Rosalind,

48:45.215 --> 48:48.677
who at first came down strongly
for marrying Phil Stern,

48:48.844 --> 48:51.847
but then wavered as she
found Bobby very likable,

48:52.014 --> 48:54.391
and passionately in love with Vonnie.

48:57.352 --> 48:59.479
Sorry, I thought everyone on
this floor had gone home.

48:59.646 --> 49:01.481
- Have a drink.
- That's ok.

49:01.648 --> 49:04.484
We are family, we can drink together.

49:04.735 --> 49:05.652
Is something the matter?

49:05.819 --> 49:09.197
You're part of the only family I
have left now I've left Karen.

49:09.489 --> 49:12.409
Did you? I hope it wasn't
too painful for you?

49:12.784 --> 49:14.620
How are things going with you and Vonnie?

49:14.953 --> 49:15.787
It's okay.

49:15.954 --> 49:18.999
Although I think she's gotten a
little nervous lately.

49:19.791 --> 49:21.084
Did she say anything?

49:21.251 --> 49:23.462
She's just nervous about our plans
to get married and move to New York,

49:23.629 --> 49:25.922
So I feel it's best if I don't push it.

49:26.632 --> 49:28.884
Although she loves me, I know,

49:29.051 --> 49:31.011
and I truly believe she's
looking forward to marrying me,

49:31.178 --> 49:33.889
because if there were too people
ever meant for each other.

49:36.516 --> 49:38.143
Come on! Don't look so glum.

49:38.310 --> 49:40.103
I'm sure your situation
will work itself out.

49:40.270 --> 49:43.148
Although it may have been more prudent
to wait until you'd told Karen.

49:43.315 --> 49:46.068
Don't lecture me on being prudent!

49:47.152 --> 49:50.072
I understand timing. Timing
is everything in life.

49:50.447 --> 49:53.075
The worst mistake you can make
in business it being premature.

49:53.241 --> 49:55.327
- I know that...
- Just remember!

49:55.535 --> 49:58.497
If you marry her I'm looking for my 10%.

49:58.705 --> 50:00.290
Okay, it's a deal.

50:00.457 --> 50:04.670
I don't want to ask you who you're in love with,
I guess it must be a ravishing movie star.

50:04.836 --> 50:06.046
No, she's not a movie star.

50:07.005 --> 50:08.674
I'm not shallow.

50:10.550 --> 50:12.386
I'm not seduced by cheap glamor.

50:12.552 --> 50:15.138
I value substance and character.
What the hell do you think I am?

50:15.597 --> 50:19.685
I wasn't implying anything like that, I thought it
might be Hedy Lamarr, I know how much she adores you.

50:19.851 --> 50:22.270
Like all your clients do.

50:22.437 --> 50:25.065
That is what makes you such a success.

50:27.984 --> 50:29.986
That was a gift. I had it framed.

50:30.529 --> 50:33.615
It's a love letter from Rudolph Valentino.

50:33.824 --> 50:36.993
She gave me that on our one
year anniversary, which is paper.

50:48.130 --> 50:50.048
What a surprise. What are you doing here?

50:50.882 --> 50:53.176
Are you going to marry
me or my Uncle Phil?

50:58.348 --> 51:00.100
I'm going to  marry Phil.

51:17.367 --> 51:21.037
It's so nice to get together for the Seder.

51:21.913 --> 51:23.832
I have to say, selfishly,

51:23.999 --> 51:27.002
It's been so nice since
you're back from Hollywood.

51:27.377 --> 51:29.171
And we're all together again.

51:29.337 --> 51:31.715
So much for your brother
taking him under his wing.

51:31.882 --> 51:35.719
Phil was helping him, but he
didn't take to it out there.

51:35.927 --> 51:36.845
I knew you'd hate it out there.

51:37.220 --> 51:41.266
I only wish my brother Phil was in
New York so he could come tonight.

51:41.433 --> 51:43.310
I'd love to meet his new wife.

51:43.477 --> 51:44.686
Wouldn't you, Martin?

51:44.936 --> 51:48.273
I don't have to. You know how
I feel about your brother.

51:48.440 --> 51:50.275
He's not a Jewish man!

51:51.109 --> 51:54.696
What kind of man throws out
his wife of 25 years...

51:54.863 --> 51:57.657
to run off with a 25 year old secretary?

51:57.824 --> 52:02.204
I hate to tell you how many
go with their secretaries.

52:02.621 --> 52:04.414
Bobby says she was really beautiful.

52:04.581 --> 52:06.291
So is looks everything?

52:06.625 --> 52:09.169
Where's character, where's loyalty?

52:12.422 --> 52:14.633
You're no beauty contest
winner but I stuck with you.

52:14.800 --> 52:15.884
That's enough wine for you.

52:16.051 --> 52:17.427
Love is an emotion.

52:17.677 --> 52:19.137
And emotions are not rational.

52:19.304 --> 52:21.264
You "fall" in love.

52:21.473 --> 52:22.641
You lose control.

52:22.891 --> 52:25.101
I have dated many wonderful women,

52:25.268 --> 52:28.980
but the minute I laid eyes on your
daughter I knew Evelyn was for me.

52:29.147 --> 52:30.482
It was pure luck!

52:30.649 --> 52:34.486
If my cab driver hadn't driven his cab through
the plate glass window of a restaurant,

52:34.653 --> 52:36.613
I never would have met Leonard.

52:36.780 --> 52:39.032
He was having coffee. We
barreled right into him!

52:39.199 --> 52:40.116
It didn't spill.

52:40.408 --> 52:42.452
Bobby, you met her.

52:42.786 --> 52:44.412
It she so fabulous?

52:45.580 --> 52:47.082
She is very lovely.

52:48.041 --> 52:50.418
She's now one of those stuck
up Hollywood movie queens?

52:50.627 --> 52:53.338
No, she's a very down to earth girl.
You'd like her.

52:53.505 --> 52:54.798
I think she'll be good for Phil.

52:55.674 --> 52:56.758
I think Daddy's right.

52:56.925 --> 53:01.096
A wife is not like a car, you don't just trade
her in after years for the latest model.

53:01.263 --> 53:04.516
That’s what our neighbor did, he kicked
his wife out for a cheap stripper...

53:04.683 --> 53:06.268
then knocked her teeth out.

53:06.434 --> 53:07.394
He's a lunatic.

53:07.561 --> 53:10.313
We live next to a crazy man.
I'm scared of him.

53:10.480 --> 53:11.648
He pushed Leonard.

53:11.815 --> 53:13.108
He didn't push me.

53:13.400 --> 53:15.902
He's a hothead. He bumped me.

53:16.069 --> 53:18.238
I was trying to explain that
he was blocking our driveway.

53:18.446 --> 53:20.240
Some people only understand
a good punch in the nose.

53:20.407 --> 53:23.869
That is not Leonard's style. Leonard
thinks everyone can be reasoned with.

53:24.035 --> 53:26.830
You have to accept the
premise of common humanity,

53:26.997 --> 53:29.457
otherwise you're in the
jungle with the beasts.

53:29.708 --> 53:32.127
The idea is to always
get in the first punch.

53:32.294 --> 53:33.420
You don't wait for the other guy.

53:33.587 --> 53:35.630
How'd you like working
for your big brother?

53:36.006 --> 53:37.883
I am very lucky. Thank you.

53:38.049 --> 53:41.720
When you came home you were
a lost soul for a while.

53:41.887 --> 53:44.472
I like working at the
nightclub, it's very lively.

53:44.639 --> 53:48.685
He took to it like a fish in water. You should
see him work the room. Everyone likes him.

53:48.852 --> 53:50.186
Not like that first manager.

53:50.770 --> 53:53.315
That deadbeat who wound
up stealing from you.

53:53.857 --> 53:55.650
He's not around anymore.

54:06.328 --> 54:10.457
Bobby looked up his socialite friends
Rad Taylor and her husband Steve.

54:10.624 --> 54:15.420
Who came to the club and spread the word
amongst the beautiful models she worked with.

54:15.587 --> 54:17.422
She got Bobby to re-decorate,

54:17.589 --> 54:20.258
and change the name of the
club to the more chi chi...

54:20.425 --> 54:22.177
Les Tropiques? I just love it!

54:22.344 --> 54:25.472
It sounds upscale and
international...and hot!

54:25.639 --> 54:27.223
I have you to thank.

54:28.558 --> 54:33.146
Soon Les Tropiques was known as the place one
could always find the driest Martinis...

54:33.313 --> 54:35.565
and the prettiest women in Manhattan.

54:36.066 --> 54:39.611
Beautiful girls attracted
celebrities and sports figures.

54:39.778 --> 54:42.364
Socialites mingled with politicians.

54:42.530 --> 54:44.950
And with the smart set came the press,

54:45.116 --> 54:47.494
and an ever growing reputation.

54:48.078 --> 54:51.998
Bobby moved more and more gracefully
amongst the rich and famous.

54:52.165 --> 54:55.085
And learned the in's and
out's of Café Society,

54:55.251 --> 55:00.548
which included any number of prominent figures
from New York's glamorous underworld.

55:02.384 --> 55:07.389
There were the Rhinebecks, who came almost every
night and ordered the finest wines in the world.

55:07.722 --> 55:09.557
They seemed like an ideal couple,

55:09.724 --> 55:12.477
except he was sleeping
with his wife's sister.

55:14.854 --> 55:18.066
And there was no shortage of
royalty from all over Europe.

55:18.233 --> 55:22.112
Like Count Henrick Van Goren who
played backgammon for millions.

55:22.278 --> 55:24.239
And his wife, the Countess Van Goren,

55:24.406 --> 55:27.993
who was actually Chickie Sherman
from Passaic, New Jersey.

55:28.368 --> 55:30.620
And that ring on Suzy Bancroft's finger,

55:30.787 --> 55:32.831
was a mere 41 carats.

55:33.415 --> 55:36.501
Of course along with the elite
came the tabloid scandals.

55:36.668 --> 55:39.129
Like Tom Price the Wall street genius...

55:39.295 --> 55:43.341
married to the much taller
automobile heiress Linda Ray Harmon.

55:43.508 --> 55:46.511
He ran through her fortune
on racehorses and showgirls,

55:46.678 --> 55:48.471
until one day, out hunting,

55:48.763 --> 55:50.432
she mistook him for a deer.

55:51.766 --> 55:55.603
And Bobby met them all and shook
their hands and joked with them.

55:55.770 --> 55:57.897
And heard their sad and happy stories...

55:58.064 --> 56:00.817
over thousand dollar magnums
of Piper-Heidsieck.

56:00.984 --> 56:02.402
And learned about life.

56:02.569 --> 56:06.322
and how in the end,
Rodgers & Hart had it right.

56:07.824 --> 56:11.369
It is so beautiful out here and
you two have been so great to me.

56:11.536 --> 56:14.956
Oh please, don't suddenly
become revoltingly sweet.

56:15.123 --> 56:17.709
Your wife hates any show of emotion.

56:18.710 --> 56:22.088
But your friendship has
meant so much to me.

56:22.255 --> 56:25.300
And Steve, you got me with such
a brilliant financial adviser.

56:25.467 --> 56:27.802
I know you're used to playing with
millions and I'm a whole other league...

56:27.969 --> 56:31.598
but at the rate I'm going you may see
applying for membership at your golf club.

56:31.765 --> 56:34.851
To get into his golf club you have
to be a lawyer or stockbroker,

56:35.018 --> 56:36.770
and can't be circumcised.

56:36.978 --> 56:39.522
Well if nothing else, I owe you everything.

56:39.689 --> 56:42.692
And I can never repay you
for introducing me...

56:42.859 --> 56:44.986
to the most wonderful thing of all...

56:45.153 --> 56:46.112
my wife.

56:46.279 --> 56:47.614
Enter en que!

56:47.781 --> 56:51.284
He was just going to tell us again how you're
like a Gershwin tune and you walked in.

56:51.451 --> 56:52.368
Stop!

56:52.702 --> 56:54.412
Hi darling, how's your martini?

56:54.579 --> 56:55.663
Good! You caught me talking about you.

56:55.830 --> 56:57.499
Bobby found a wife.

56:58.083 --> 57:01.461
After assorted unsatisfying
flirtations and affairs...

57:01.628 --> 57:04.672
one night in the club, in walked a group.

57:04.839 --> 57:07.342
And his eye was caught by
an elegant young blond.

57:07.509 --> 57:09.135
That's Veronica Hayes.

57:09.302 --> 57:10.845
She just got divorced.

57:11.012 --> 57:13.640
Her husband left her for her best friend.
It came as a shock to her.

57:13.807 --> 57:14.474
My goodness...

57:14.641 --> 57:16.059
She's a great girl.

57:16.476 --> 57:18.144
We all felt so bad for her.

57:18.311 --> 57:20.772
Maybe we can cheer her up.
Can you introduce me?

57:20.980 --> 57:23.149
- Veronica, you look beautiful!
- You too.

57:23.316 --> 57:24.734
- Good to see you.
- You too.

57:24.901 --> 57:27.570
I'd like you to meet Bobby Dorfman.
He runs the place.

57:27.737 --> 57:29.864
Is this your first time here?

57:30.031 --> 57:32.951
Yes. The papers were right,
it's got real electricity...

57:33.118 --> 57:33.952
It does, right?

57:34.119 --> 57:35.912
- We're happy to have you.
- Thank you.

57:36.538 --> 57:38.414
My goodness... She's single?

57:38.706 --> 57:40.375
- Yes !
- It's a criminal offense.

57:42.627 --> 57:43.795
Excuse me.

57:44.420 --> 57:46.089
What are you doing later?

57:46.256 --> 57:47.215
Later?

57:47.882 --> 57:49.843
There is no later it's 1.30am.

57:50.009 --> 57:51.928
I get off in half an hour.

57:52.095 --> 57:54.430
I'm usually in pajamas by 2 am.

57:54.806 --> 57:56.432
I love pajamas.

57:56.641 --> 57:58.184
What side of the bed do you like?

57:58.560 --> 57:59.936
Slow down!

58:00.103 --> 58:02.021
He's pushier than you!

58:02.939 --> 58:04.941
Come on, you guys...

58:07.777 --> 58:09.445
You like jazz music?

58:09.612 --> 58:10.613
At 2 in the morning?

58:10.780 --> 58:12.782
At any time in the morning.

58:12.949 --> 58:15.034
Your name is Veronica, right?

58:15.785 --> 58:17.620
Anybody ever call you Vonnie for short?

58:17.787 --> 58:18.788
Not usually, no.

58:18.955 --> 58:20.290
It's a pretty name.

58:21.499 --> 58:23.293
But you like jazz though?

58:24.419 --> 58:25.837
Yeah, I love jazz.

58:26.129 --> 58:27.463
Well it's fate.

58:28.548 --> 58:29.716
Who doesn't love jazz?

58:29.883 --> 58:31.467
I have met one woman...

58:31.634 --> 58:32.594
Terrible.

58:48.193 --> 58:49.485
This is great.

58:50.570 --> 58:52.322
I'd love another scotch.

58:53.406 --> 58:55.950
My one regret in life is I
can't play an instrument.

58:56.576 --> 58:58.995
- I used to date a musician.
- Did you?

58:59.829 --> 59:01.664
A Sax player, very brilliant.

59:01.831 --> 59:05.001
He'd play those sad songs
with so much feeling.

59:05.293 --> 59:06.669
It can make you cry.

59:06.836 --> 59:08.129
It's a great gift.

59:08.296 --> 59:10.506
I would have married him
but he was a dope addict.

59:10.882 --> 59:13.259
I don't like dope. It messes you up.

59:13.426 --> 59:15.637
I tried it a few times when I was with him.

59:15.803 --> 59:18.765
We smoked weed first and
I even tried opium once.

59:18.932 --> 59:21.976
Look at you! What was the effect?

59:22.185 --> 59:25.563
I didn't Ike it. I don't have
an addictive personality.

59:25.730 --> 59:26.981
He did.

59:27.857 --> 59:29.442
But Muggles made me feel sexy.

59:29.609 --> 59:31.694
- Sorry, Muggles?
 - The reefers.

59:31.861 --> 59:34.530
- You call them Muggles?
- He did.

59:34.864 --> 59:36.366
So you married a musician?

59:37.242 --> 59:38.868
I married a stock broker.

59:39.202 --> 59:40.203
You divorced?

59:40.370 --> 59:43.331
he divorced me because my best
friend was better in bed.

59:43.498 --> 59:44.874
- Was she?
- Yeah, I guess!

59:45.041 --> 59:46.668
He should have saved
some of the Muggles.

59:46.834 --> 59:50.964
I learned too late that I can get where
I need to with two or three drinks.

59:52.215 --> 59:54.092
So what do you do?

59:54.259 --> 59:56.261
I work in City Hall, the mayor's office.

59:56.427 --> 59:58.346
- Really? Doing what ?
- Public relations.

59:58.513 --> 01:00:00.223
I hope you don't mind
a Democratic liberal?

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:04.060
My whole family are
democrats, we're Jews so...

01:00:04.227 --> 01:00:05.353
How quaint!

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.689
That plays right into my rebellious streak.

01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:11.234
In Oklahoma, we weren't even
allowed to mingle with Jews growing up.

01:00:11.401 --> 01:00:12.735
You guys are money lenders!

01:00:12.944 --> 01:00:14.529
We control everything, actually.

01:00:14.696 --> 01:00:17.282
I didn't even see a Jew
until I moved to New York.

01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:18.700
No horns...

01:00:19.075 --> 01:00:22.078
I find Jews exotic and mysterious.

01:00:22.245 --> 01:00:23.871
I wouldn't mind if you had horns.

01:00:24.122 --> 01:00:25.081
You wouldn't?

01:00:25.832 --> 01:00:28.084
Ok lets go. We'll go to my place.

01:00:28.376 --> 01:00:30.420
No, I'm not gonna sleep with you...

01:00:30.795 --> 01:00:32.672
No, Jew or no Jew, we just met!

01:00:32.839 --> 01:00:34.924
Have one or two more drinks...

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:39.012
No thank you. You will just have to wait.
My goodness!

01:00:40.263 --> 01:00:43.933
It's true what they say!
You people are pushy!

01:00:44.642 --> 01:00:46.060
It's part of the charm.

01:00:54.068 --> 01:00:56.612
- I had a great time tonight.
- Me too.

01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.990
Will you call me?

01:00:59.157 --> 01:01:00.116
Yes I will.

01:01:00.283 --> 01:01:01.909
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:04.871
And since it is tomorrow,
I'll call you in 15 minutes.

01:01:05.038 --> 01:01:06.831
So I should head home.

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:10.293
Good night.

01:01:19.719 --> 01:01:23.431
In all that season they saw
each other every single day.

01:01:23.723 --> 01:01:25.641
And it was a beautiful summer.

01:01:25.975 --> 01:01:27.518
Thank you, Rad. This is the last one.

01:01:27.685 --> 01:01:31.105
Then one Saturday afternoon,
some months later,

01:01:31.272 --> 01:01:32.565
she made an announcement.

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:33.941
I am pregnant.

01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:39.781
Are you crushed?

01:01:41.449 --> 01:01:43.618
No, it's wonderful.

01:01:43.785 --> 01:01:46.120
So what's our next move?

01:01:46.537 --> 01:01:48.206
I would like to have the baby.

01:01:48.748 --> 01:01:52.835
Unless you don't want me to, I could
go to Mexico and have it done safely.

01:01:53.086 --> 01:01:55.213
Vonnie, we are not going to
Mexico we are going to...

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.924
Niagara Falls, if anywhere.

01:01:58.508 --> 01:02:01.386
- Are you sure this is what you want?
- Yes of course!

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:04.972
When they call our kid a little bastard,
you don't want them to be right do you?

01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:06.641
You called me Vonnie.

01:02:06.808 --> 01:02:08.393
You've never called me that.

01:02:09.477 --> 01:02:11.979
If I did, I think I've
had too much champagne.

01:02:12.438 --> 01:02:14.899
That's what you said your
old girlfriend was called.

01:02:16.526 --> 01:02:18.152
Well, ok...two Veronicas.

01:02:18.319 --> 01:02:20.196
What do you want me to say? I'm lucky.

01:02:20.363 --> 01:02:21.781
Are you going to marry me or not?

01:02:21.948 --> 01:02:23.616
- Yes of course!
- Good.

01:02:23.783 --> 01:02:24.992
That's the right answer!

01:02:25.326 --> 01:02:26.869
- We're having a baby!
- I love you.

01:02:27.036 --> 01:02:27.870
The wedding,

01:02:28.371 --> 01:02:32.208
which was a simple affair, and took
place at City Hall two months later...

01:02:32.375 --> 01:02:33.793
was a happy event.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:38.131
But as Bobby's brother in law
said: life has it's own agenda.

01:02:40.049 --> 01:02:41.384
Yes? What do you want?

01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:46.389
Could you turn down the
radio, just a little?

01:02:46.556 --> 01:02:50.184
I'm not asking you to turn it off.
My wife gets these migraines.

01:02:50.393 --> 01:02:53.646
Don't tell me how to play my radio.
Keep your nose outta my business.

01:02:53.855 --> 01:02:56.232
She rarely gets them...

01:02:56.399 --> 01:02:58.109
Just lower it.

01:02:58.401 --> 01:02:59.986
if she's sick call your doctor!

01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:04.198
We did. He gives her something but
migraines are a terrible curse.

01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:08.453
I work hard, I'm gonna play my radio.
You don't like it? Too bad!

01:03:08.619 --> 01:03:09.662
You're not understanding me...

01:03:09.871 --> 01:03:13.749
I'm not asking you not to play it,
just modulate the sound a little.

01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:15.460
I don't want to call the police.

01:03:16.335 --> 01:03:18.504
You think I'm afraid of the police?

01:03:18.838 --> 01:03:20.715
I can play my radio!

01:03:21.007 --> 01:03:23.468
What can I say? He has the law on his side.

01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:25.761
I'll gonna have my
brother Ben talk to him.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:29.265
Ben is a hot-head. I am
not looking for trouble.

01:03:29.432 --> 01:03:31.225
Promise me you won't
make this into an issue?

01:03:31.392 --> 01:03:32.935
He makes this into an issue!

01:03:33.102 --> 01:03:35.313
He needs somebody to read him the riot act!

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.815
It's not that big a deal.

01:03:37.982 --> 01:03:40.401
You don't have the migraines!

01:03:42.612 --> 01:03:45.281
Bobby and Veronica named the baby Susan.

01:03:45.448 --> 01:03:48.826
In that fall, found the
perfect house on the Hudson.

01:03:49.118 --> 01:03:50.953
We called the police and
they spoke with him.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.290
and last week, he gets drunk
and puts a dent in our car.

01:03:54.457 --> 01:03:57.335
When Leonard speaks to him about
it he threatens to beat him up.

01:03:57.502 --> 01:03:58.461
He did?

01:03:58.628 --> 01:04:00.379
I need to talk to this character.

01:04:00.546 --> 01:04:02.298
Leonard doesn't want trouble...

01:04:02.465 --> 01:04:06.177
But I think he needs someone to tell him
we're not going to stand for this anymore...

01:04:06.344 --> 01:04:09.222
and to stop making our lives miserable.

01:04:09.388 --> 01:04:12.016
He accuses us of things we've never done.

01:04:12.475 --> 01:04:14.519
He threatened to shoot our dog.

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:15.853
He's a crazy man!

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:19.982
And my husband keeps deluding himself that
he's going to listen to reason, meanwhile...

01:04:20.149 --> 01:04:21.651
it never stops!

01:04:21.817 --> 01:04:23.486
He threatened to shoot your dog?

01:04:23.653 --> 01:04:25.112
I think he's got a gun.

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:27.657
He's a security guard at a lumberyard.

01:04:27.823 --> 01:04:30.034
Joe Wojehowitz.

01:04:47.468 --> 01:04:49.512
- You Joe Wojehowitz?
- Who wants to know?

01:04:49.679 --> 01:04:51.097
Are you are Joe Wojehowitz?

01:04:51.264 --> 01:04:52.306
Yeah. What?

01:04:54.392 --> 01:04:56.477
Joe, get in the car...

01:04:56.644 --> 01:04:58.479
- Why?
- We want to talk.

01:04:58.646 --> 01:05:00.481
- What?
- Get in the car!

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:03.234
What are you doing? Get off me!

01:05:41.522 --> 01:05:46.027
Café Society it was called and Bobby
Dorfman was right in the thick of it.

01:05:46.485 --> 01:05:49.488
There were the millionaire
playboys like Buddy Winslow Fain,

01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:51.198
who bought anything he wanted,

01:05:51.365 --> 01:05:55.328
from high class models off the
covers of every magazine in town...

01:05:55.494 --> 01:05:58.789
to the best seats at every
show and sporting event.

01:05:59.123 --> 01:06:00.541
Then there were the politicians,

01:06:00.708 --> 01:06:04.462
who fixed your streets, your parking
tickets and your tax returns.

01:06:04.629 --> 01:06:07.423
As long as the contributions
kept coming in.

01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:13.304
There was Norton Lockerbee and his
underage fiancée, the dancer Cherry Grace.

01:06:13.471 --> 01:06:15.765
And the Remsens, about whom it was said...

01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:19.226
had stayed a week in Berlin
at the home of Adolf Hitler.

01:06:19.393 --> 01:06:22.938
And of course there were any number
of colorful associates of Ben's...

01:06:23.105 --> 01:06:27.193
some of whom were destined to end up
on the front pages of the tabloids,

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:31.238
leaking blood on the sidewalk
due to cranial lintilation.

01:06:31.947 --> 01:06:35.242
It seemed Bobby knew everyone
in Manhattan society.

01:06:35.576 --> 01:06:37.912
His wife Veronica now rarely came in,

01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:40.498
having succumbed to the joys of motherhood.

01:06:40.665 --> 01:06:41.749
Then one evening,

01:06:42.375 --> 01:06:44.043
in walked the past.

01:06:54.053 --> 01:06:55.221
May I help you?

01:06:55.388 --> 01:06:59.350
Yes. I understand my nephews are
around usually. They own the place.

01:06:59.517 --> 01:07:00.476
Mr Dorfman?

01:07:00.643 --> 01:07:01.936
Bobby, yes. Or Ben.

01:07:02.103 --> 01:07:04.522
Ben's not here tonight but Bobby's around.
Would you like to be seated?

01:07:04.689 --> 01:07:05.731
Please.

01:07:07.441 --> 01:07:08.734
I made a very big deal today.

01:07:08.901 --> 01:07:11.946
Champagne for the table! Before
we start drinking for real.

01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:14.448
Fred, how are you?

01:07:14.615 --> 01:07:16.117
You remember Vonnie?

01:07:16.701 --> 01:07:19.036
We're in town for a few
weeks, we'll catch up.

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:24.542
It's going to be a very big stock. I'm
telling you it's going through the roof.

01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:26.794
Now's the time to get in on it,
but you didn't hear that here!

01:07:26.961 --> 01:07:28.254
- Didn't hear what?
- Exactly.

01:07:28.421 --> 01:07:29.588
Thank you, Marvin.

01:07:29.755 --> 01:07:32.007
There are some people to see you.
They say they know you.

01:07:32.174 --> 01:07:33.050
Really?

01:07:33.217 --> 01:07:34.135
Table 4.

01:07:34.301 --> 01:07:35.761
Everybody knows me.

01:07:44.103 --> 01:07:45.980
Robert! How you doing?

01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:47.606
You remember Vonnie?

01:07:48.649 --> 01:07:51.152
And this is Gloria and Craig Bennett.

01:07:53.154 --> 01:07:54.697
Have a seat, join us.

01:07:55.698 --> 01:07:58.325
I wish I could but I'm very busy tonight.

01:07:58.492 --> 01:07:59.535
I can see!

01:07:59.952 --> 01:08:02.163
This place has a reputation all
the way across the country!

01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:03.164
Please, join us.

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:04.915
Sit down for five minutes.
You're going to offend us.

01:08:05.082 --> 01:08:06.208
Five minutes.

01:08:11.005 --> 01:08:12.631
- Look at you!
- You look well!

01:08:12.798 --> 01:08:13.924
He does look well.

01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:18.053
We are celebrating because I just made
a deal for Irene Dunne at Universal.

01:08:18.304 --> 01:08:19.054
I just love her.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:20.848
What is she like?

01:08:21.265 --> 01:08:23.058
She's great, honestly.

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:26.270
He has a...for Irene Dunne.
Sorry, honey!

01:08:26.562 --> 01:08:28.314
- Tell her.
- No, you tell her.

01:08:28.481 --> 01:08:31.859
We met Irene first at the Coconut Grove.

01:08:32.026 --> 01:08:35.696
We were with Errol Flynn and one of
his gorgeous young "discoveries"

01:08:35.863 --> 01:08:37.406
as he likes to call them.

01:08:37.698 --> 01:08:39.033
And so...

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.327
I know his reputation is not so great,

01:08:41.493 --> 01:08:43.537
but we adore him, he's lovely.

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:47.207
He hosted us off the coast of Catalina
on his yacht and he was a gracious host.

01:08:47.792 --> 01:08:49.292
Irene, is ...

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:50.544
a little...

01:08:50.795 --> 01:08:54.381
gorgeous in person but proper.

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:56.258
We were at Busby Berkeley's partying...

01:08:56.425 --> 01:08:59.053
She was asked to have a puff of a cigar.

01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.889
It was if she'd been asked
to take her clothes off.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:03.974
She was mortified.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.894
Then Errol leans in and introduces
her to this teenage starlet.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.939
Then she asks if it's his daughter.

01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:12.524
Without missing a beat, Errol
looks at her and says:

01:09:12.691 --> 01:09:13.651
"No...

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.028
"This is my granddaughter."

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:19.073
I died!

01:09:19.907 --> 01:09:21.367
In London, he was mobbed.

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:24.370
I didn't realize but he's a
great hero to the British.

01:09:24.578 --> 01:09:26.747
- I love London.
- I could live there...

01:09:27.957 --> 01:09:29.750
I love it but I love Paris more.

01:09:29.917 --> 01:09:33.254
And Venice. We keep vowing
to get a place there.

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.256
Bob Montgomery and his wife have one.

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:36.674
You ever met them?

01:09:36.841 --> 01:09:40.051
They are lovely. A gorgeous couple.

01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:42.345
Little Bobby...

01:09:43.555 --> 01:09:44.974
Wow, you really made it big Robert.

01:09:45.307 --> 01:09:47.600
I always knew you'd make
it one way or another.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:51.772
I was breaking this kid in as an agent
and he said he preferred New York.

01:09:51.939 --> 01:09:53.774
Which I completely understand.

01:09:55.734 --> 01:09:58.779
You'll have to excuse me. I didn't
expect such a mad house in here tonight.

01:09:58.946 --> 01:10:00.823
We'll be in town 4 or 5 weeks.

01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:03.492
Oh! And congratulations on becoming a dad!

01:10:03.659 --> 01:10:04.910
Absolutely!

01:10:06.495 --> 01:10:08.455
Frank, let me have a scotch.

01:10:10.374 --> 01:10:12.585
- Hey Bobby. How's your wife?
 - She's fine, thank you.

01:10:12.751 --> 01:10:13.961
We never see her
around here anymore.

01:10:14.128 --> 01:10:16.380
She's become very domestic
since our daughter came.

01:10:16.547 --> 01:10:17.756
That's what happens.

01:10:17.923 --> 01:10:20.426
They become mothers and
everything falls off.

01:10:20.593 --> 01:10:22.261
If you know what I mean.

01:10:22.636 --> 01:10:24.138
Because hormones...

01:10:24.763 --> 01:10:25.931
Sometimes they never come back.

01:10:26.098 --> 01:10:28.976
Now I see are diapers.

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:32.271
Listen.

01:10:33.063 --> 01:10:35.816
If you say I told you I'll deny it.

01:10:36.108 --> 01:10:39.445
The DA's office has had
some serious discussions,

01:10:39.612 --> 01:10:41.030
About your brother,

01:10:41.196 --> 01:10:43.532
And his business friends.

01:10:43.824 --> 01:10:44.867
Meaning?

01:10:45.618 --> 01:10:46.994
I do not know yet,

01:10:47.161 --> 01:10:50.247
but it's possible that
things could get hot.

01:10:50.414 --> 01:10:52.041
I'm just giving you a heads up.

01:10:52.207 --> 01:10:54.501
Thank you. Can you do something about it?

01:10:55.628 --> 01:10:58.005
Can I help it if we have a clean mayor?

01:10:59.089 --> 01:11:00.549
So, what are they looking at?

01:11:01.717 --> 01:11:05.262
Racketeering, extortion, tax evasion...

01:11:06.221 --> 01:11:08.015
Maybe worse for Ben.

01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:10.559
My advice to your brother:

01:11:10.893 --> 01:11:13.187
is to go someplace for a while.

01:11:14.021 --> 01:11:15.564
He likes Havana.

01:11:16.982 --> 01:11:18.651
I will definitely tell him, thank you.

01:11:18.817 --> 01:11:20.402
Thank you for the heads up.

01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:25.866
Are you looking for something?

01:11:26.033 --> 01:11:28.369
Just you. Just wanted to say hello.

01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:30.746
Are you kidding me?

01:11:31.372 --> 01:11:32.206
Meaning what?

01:11:32.665 --> 01:11:34.458
Meaning that you should
listen to yourself...

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:39.004
You've become everything you used to poke
fun at. Everything you couldn't stand.

01:11:39.546 --> 01:11:40.673
You know...

01:11:42.049 --> 01:11:45.636
time passes, life moves on.

01:11:45.886 --> 01:11:46.845
People change.

01:11:47.096 --> 01:11:49.139
All the talk of the simple life...

01:11:49.306 --> 01:11:52.267
It would be comical if it wasn't so sad.

01:11:54.186 --> 01:11:57.773
You're not necessarily the
same person you were either.

01:11:59.817 --> 01:12:01.402
No, you're right.

01:12:01.568 --> 01:12:03.320
Life moves on ...

01:12:03.487 --> 01:12:04.905
People grow up.

01:12:05.864 --> 01:12:06.949
Have lunch with me.

01:12:07.116 --> 01:12:11.161
So you can impress me with name dropping and
describing all the fancy parties you go to?

01:12:11.328 --> 01:12:14.456
No, I'll behave myself. I won't
babble on like a Hollywood wife...

01:12:14.623 --> 01:12:18.168
if you promise to go easy on
me for running off with Phil.

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:22.381
Let's just turn back the
clock and take a walk.

01:12:22.548 --> 01:12:23.924
We can do it.

01:12:24.216 --> 01:12:25.759
I have a lot of time on my hands,

01:12:25.926 --> 01:12:28.554
I'm dying to know what's going on with you.

01:12:30.639 --> 01:12:32.307
I will say you're still...

01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:34.101
amazingly beautiful.

01:12:40.607 --> 01:12:42.985
I haven't seen our next door
neighbor in quite a while.

01:12:43.152 --> 01:12:44.361
Maybe he's away.

01:12:44.528 --> 01:12:48.282
He was always out watering the lawn.
It's getting brown.

01:12:48.449 --> 01:12:50.409
And his mail is piling up.

01:12:50.576 --> 01:12:52.119
You think something's wrong?

01:12:52.286 --> 01:12:54.788
You think he's at home on the floor
with a heart attack or something?

01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:58.917
Count your blessings. It would
serve him right if he dropped dead.

01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:01.253
Don't say that. Take that back!

01:13:01.462 --> 01:13:03.297
Shall I ask the police to come check?

01:13:03.464 --> 01:13:06.008
I wouldn't. It's not our business.

01:13:06.175 --> 01:13:07.468
Of course it's our business.

01:13:07.634 --> 01:13:09.595
People are responsible for one another,

01:13:09.762 --> 01:13:11.388
even if he is a louse.

01:13:11.555 --> 01:13:13.474
I'd let it go if I were you.

01:13:13.849 --> 01:13:15.517
What is that supposed to mean?

01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:18.228
Is there something you're not telling me?

01:13:20.439 --> 01:13:22.149
I'm worried, Leonard.

01:13:22.649 --> 01:13:24.109
Why, Evelyn?

01:13:24.526 --> 01:13:26.820
Is something going on I don't know about?

01:13:28.697 --> 01:13:30.532
I may have done something wrong.

01:13:30.991 --> 01:13:32.743
What are you keeping from me?

01:13:34.036 --> 01:13:36.163
When we saw Bobby and Veronica's baby,

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:39.249
I told Ben that we were having
trouble with our neighbor,

01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:41.460
and the police were not very helpful.

01:13:41.627 --> 01:13:42.586
Ben?

01:13:43.295 --> 01:13:45.172
I was scared of him Leonard!

01:13:45.339 --> 01:13:46.799
We have a child.

01:13:46.965 --> 01:13:48.342
He was a volatile neighbor,

01:13:48.509 --> 01:13:50.928
he was a drinker, he was nasty...

01:13:51.095 --> 01:13:55.099
He constantly made trouble. He was a
security guard so I know he owns a gun.

01:13:55.265 --> 01:13:57.684
Who knew when he might
fly off the handle!

01:13:58.936 --> 01:14:01.438
You didn't have Ben threaten him?

01:14:01.605 --> 01:14:02.940
Or hurt him?

01:14:03.107 --> 01:14:05.484
I just asked Ben to talk to him.

01:14:05.651 --> 01:14:09.154
You tried speaking to him but
you're so mild mannered!

01:14:09.696 --> 01:14:13.408
I thought Ben would tell him if he
did not start behaving himself...

01:14:13.784 --> 01:14:15.077
What?

01:14:15.244 --> 01:14:16.912
That he would break his legs?

01:14:17.079 --> 01:14:17.871
Has he broken his legs?

01:14:18.038 --> 01:14:21.083
I just asked Ben to talk to him.
Just to tell him to back off.

01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:22.251
Or what?

01:14:22.417 --> 01:14:25.129
Ben is a thug, a gangster.

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:27.381
Did he put him in the hospital?

01:14:27.548 --> 01:14:29.299
I don't know, Leonard.

01:14:29.466 --> 01:14:30.717
And I don't want to know.

01:14:30.884 --> 01:14:32.010
It's wrong!

01:14:32.177 --> 01:14:33.262
It's wrong!

01:14:33.428 --> 01:14:36.014
Is it a proportionate
response that this poor guy,

01:14:36.181 --> 01:14:38.767
is laying in some
hospital bed all beat up.

01:14:46.066 --> 01:14:47.192
This is delicious.

01:14:47.359 --> 01:14:49.027
And I love this place.

01:14:50.571 --> 01:14:52.906
It reminds me of our little
Mexican joint, it's a dump.

01:14:53.073 --> 01:14:53.824
It is.

01:14:54.032 --> 01:14:57.452
It's not the Brown Derby, it's not
Busby Berkeley's pool party...

01:14:57.619 --> 01:15:00.247
You won't be running into Fred Astaire.

01:15:01.498 --> 01:15:04.001
How's your wife? Tell me about her.
I'm curious.

01:15:05.002 --> 01:15:06.128
She is lovely.

01:15:06.295 --> 01:15:07.546
What is her name?

01:15:07.838 --> 01:15:08.922
Veronica.

01:15:09.506 --> 01:15:10.924
- No it's not!
- It is.

01:15:11.091 --> 01:15:13.844
- Stop it.
- She pronounces it differently.

01:15:15.762 --> 01:15:17.306
- I'm flattered.
- I know.

01:15:17.681 --> 01:15:19.099
Life is a comedy,

01:15:19.474 --> 01:15:21.602
written by a sadistic comedy writer.

01:15:21.768 --> 01:15:24.146
I was in love with you and you
decided to marry my uncle,

01:15:24.313 --> 01:15:26.398
what makes you ... my aunt.

01:15:27.774 --> 01:15:28.942
Aunt Vonnie.

01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:32.362
I think I still have a
crush on you Aunt Vonnie.

01:15:34.573 --> 01:15:35.782
I'm in here.

01:15:36.116 --> 01:15:37.117
Honey!

01:15:38.952 --> 01:15:40.662
What is that?

01:15:42.122 --> 01:15:43.540
Flowers?

01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:47.085
- I can't believe you got me flowers.
- Why?

01:15:47.252 --> 01:15:48.378
What's the occasion?

01:15:48.587 --> 01:15:51.924
I haven't gotten you
flowers in a long time.

01:15:52.299 --> 01:15:55.010
You've been in a very up
mood all week, flowers...

01:15:55.177 --> 01:15:57.387
Did your numbers come in or
are you guilty of something?

01:15:57.554 --> 01:16:00.641
A husband can't get his wife flowers
without getting the third degree!

01:16:00.807 --> 01:16:02.392
No. I love them.

01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:03.685
Of course you can.

01:16:03.936 --> 01:16:04.853
I love you.

01:16:05.646 --> 01:16:06.563
Thank you.

01:16:09.483 --> 01:16:13.820
With Phil busy, Bobby used every
excuse to spend time with Vonnie.

01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:16.907
He showed her around Manhattan
and took her to Coney Island.

01:16:17.074 --> 01:16:21.453
And when she remembered she still owed him that
dinner she never got to cook for him in Hollywood,

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:23.789
he arranged for her
to do it Downtown.

01:16:23.956 --> 01:16:26.541
I hope that it's perfect, I
make it the same every time...

01:16:26.708 --> 01:16:30.254
but I've been going on
about it for years now...

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:34.591
If it's not perfect then you can go back in
the kitchen and re-cook the whole thing.

01:16:34.758 --> 01:16:36.677
Or you could put that
block of cheese on it...

01:16:36.843 --> 01:16:40.305
That's true. I'm sure it will be fine. In
fact I've known the Pugioni's for years...

01:16:40.472 --> 01:16:42.015
- Long time.
- How long Vito?

01:16:42.182 --> 01:16:43.183
Real long.

01:16:43.517 --> 01:16:47.813
For me a really long time but I'm glad you've
made good on your promise and cooked for me!

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:49.147
Good wine.

01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:51.191
This is such an inspired idea...

01:16:53.568 --> 01:16:54.736
You don't have to lie.

01:16:54.903 --> 01:16:56.154
It was superb.

01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:57.447
It was absolutely superb.

01:16:57.614 --> 01:16:58.699
Vito, tell her.

01:16:58.865 --> 01:17:00.742
- Delicious.
- Thank you. Would he lie?

01:17:00.909 --> 01:17:02.244
- Would I lie?
- I don't think so.

01:17:02.411 --> 01:17:05.205
Where are we going next? I
don't want to go home yet.

01:17:05.455 --> 01:17:06.581
Vito, anything?

01:17:06.748 --> 01:17:08.583
There's a craps game at Brooklyn.

01:17:08.917 --> 01:17:10.168
You feel lucky?

01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:13.630
That's amazing!

01:17:13.797 --> 01:17:15.382
Loaded dice!

01:17:15.549 --> 01:17:17.092
Beginners luck. That's
her second roll.

01:17:17.259 --> 01:17:18.802
I just keep going and going?

01:17:18.969 --> 01:17:20.387
Yes, of course if you're doing well.

01:18:14.191 --> 01:18:16.443
New York really is fabulous.

01:18:17.611 --> 01:18:19.988
And I would know, I've been
traveling quite a lot.

01:18:20.155 --> 01:18:21.406
I know you've mentioned that.

01:18:21.573 --> 01:18:24.993
How could you choose anywhere else? I know
Hollywood's occasionally exiting but...

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:28.955
but nothing beats Broadway
or the cheesecake at Lindy's.

01:18:31.083 --> 01:18:32.167
Listen to you...

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:38.090
Drinking wine in Central Park,
we haven't slept. You've...

01:18:39.132 --> 01:18:41.218
You've always had a touch
of the poet in you.

01:18:41.385 --> 01:18:43.845
Really? I'm not like them...

01:18:47.391 --> 01:18:49.601
What could I do? I had to choose.

01:18:51.478 --> 01:18:54.898
As my brother in law says:
"Alternatives exclude."

01:18:56.316 --> 01:18:58.735
Yeah, I loved you and I loved Phil.

01:18:58.944 --> 01:19:01.154
I was with him a year and a half...

01:19:01.405 --> 01:19:02.656
and you were this...

01:19:03.865 --> 01:19:06.660
awkward but adorable,

01:19:07.452 --> 01:19:08.620
frantic,

01:19:09.496 --> 01:19:12.082
young, romantic, trying to find yourself.

01:19:12.249 --> 01:19:14.334
And I had this big shot.

01:19:14.668 --> 01:19:15.877
It was difficult.

01:19:18.672 --> 01:19:22.467
I didn't know if it would work out.
I didn't want to lose you both...

01:19:22.676 --> 01:19:24.010
I thought maybe...

01:19:24.177 --> 01:19:28.390
If you didn't make it the way you wanted
you'd be resentful and we'd be unhappy.

01:19:28.557 --> 01:19:29.516
Who knows?

01:19:29.891 --> 01:19:32.686
I never stopped thinking about you.

01:19:32.853 --> 01:19:34.396
Not for one day.

01:19:35.313 --> 01:19:37.107
I still dream about you.

01:19:39.484 --> 01:19:40.485
But...

01:19:42.404 --> 01:19:44.114
I'm Phil's wife.

01:19:45.323 --> 01:19:49.703
And he's been very good to me. And he
loves me and he's changed his life for me.

01:19:51.329 --> 01:19:52.831
I've been a good wife to him.

01:19:53.206 --> 01:19:55.375
Yet you dream about me.

01:19:58.295 --> 01:20:00.839
You're a happily married man with a child.

01:20:01.339 --> 01:20:03.550
- You said it yourself.
- I know what I said.

01:20:04.259 --> 01:20:07.012
But we are alone in Central Park.

01:20:07.387 --> 01:20:09.723
The light's reflecting off the building.

01:20:27.157 --> 01:20:28.575
Satisfied?

01:20:59.856 --> 01:21:02.192
As the investigation into Ben proceeded...

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:05.111
there was no shortage of
evidence or informants.

01:21:05.278 --> 01:21:08.823
and indictments followed,
including murder one.

01:21:09.241 --> 01:21:12.452
I can't get my mind around it.
The whole thing is so horrible.

01:21:12.619 --> 01:21:15.038
I am firmly against all execution.

01:21:15.205 --> 01:21:17.624
Thank God, they never
found the neighbors body.

01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:19.417
What difference does that make?

01:21:19.584 --> 01:21:22.754
We may not be criminally liable but we
have to live with our conscious.

01:21:22.921 --> 01:21:24.881
I only said Ben should talk to him!

01:21:25.048 --> 01:21:27.175
Don't be naive. You wanted him threatened!

01:21:27.342 --> 01:21:28.176
Warned!

01:21:28.343 --> 01:21:30.762
I wanted him warned!

01:21:30.929 --> 01:21:32.347
What difference does that make?

01:21:33.098 --> 01:21:34.057
Your brother...

01:21:34.224 --> 01:21:35.725
Don't keep on me Leonard.

01:21:35.892 --> 01:21:38.395
Somebody had to deal with
that crazy next door...

01:21:38.562 --> 01:21:40.272
It was becoming intolerable.

01:21:40.438 --> 01:21:44.109
You don't kill a man because
he plays his radio too loud!

01:21:44.276 --> 01:21:48.280
Calm down. She did not realize, and they
have enough on Ben without your neighbor.

01:21:48.446 --> 01:21:49.823
This is a different issue.

01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:53.034
Meanwhile, there is a
blood sin on our hands.

01:21:53.201 --> 01:21:54.536
Oh Christ!

01:21:54.703 --> 01:21:56.079
Don't get so biblical.

01:21:56.246 --> 01:21:58.623
Evelyn, calm down. Take an aspirin.

01:21:58.832 --> 01:22:01.751
I'm going to give you the name
of a very good criminal lawyer,

01:22:01.918 --> 01:22:03.003
Jake Murray.

01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:04.129
He's the best you can do.

01:22:04.296 --> 01:22:05.297
Thank you so much.

01:22:06.256 --> 01:22:08.800
She is devastated. I think
she'll have a nervous breakdown.

01:22:08.967 --> 01:22:10.760
She's driving me crazy.

01:22:10.927 --> 01:22:12.429
As if I'm not upset enough.

01:22:12.596 --> 01:22:16.808
What did you think, Rose? Everybody seemed
to know he was involved in shady activities.

01:22:16.975 --> 01:22:19.477
I don't believe he killed anybody.

01:22:19.644 --> 01:22:23.732
My father always knew he was a wheeler-dealer but
as details come out it gets worse and worse.

01:22:24.274 --> 01:22:27.694
What we need is a great criminal
lawyer and I know just the guy...

01:22:27.861 --> 01:22:28.987
my old pal Peter Bryce.

01:22:29.154 --> 01:22:30.530
Not Jake Murray?

01:22:30.697 --> 01:22:33.992
Bryce never loses, but if you like
Murray we'll get him as well..

01:22:34.451 --> 01:22:39.331
I don't know if Bryce can get him to walk but the
trick now is to spare him the electric chair.

01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:44.127
The trial went as anticipated.

01:22:44.294 --> 01:22:47.088
The evidence against Ben Dorfman
 was overwhelming.

01:22:47.255 --> 01:22:49.799
He was found guilty on all charges,

01:22:49.966 --> 01:22:52.010
including murder in the first degree.

01:22:52.344 --> 01:22:55.055
Despite the efforts of
two high priced lawyers,

01:22:55.221 --> 01:22:58.767
he was sentenced to die in the
electric chair at Sing Sing.

01:23:09.569 --> 01:23:13.031
This is Father Brolian. He's guiding
me to understand Christianity.

01:23:13.365 --> 01:23:16.076
Today we discussed the sixth psalm...

01:23:16.368 --> 01:23:19.621
"Oh Lord, do not punish me in anger...

01:23:19.788 --> 01:23:22.040
"Do not chastise me in fury."

01:23:22.207 --> 01:23:23.041
That right Father?

01:23:23.208 --> 01:23:24.709
I'm flabbergasted.

01:23:24.876 --> 01:23:28.588
We both didn't have time for this bullshit
but when the end is near you need something.

01:23:28.755 --> 01:23:31.925
You don't want to be buried as
a Jew in a Jewish cemetery?

01:23:32.092 --> 01:23:34.386
The Jewish religion doesn't
believe in an afterlife.

01:23:34.552 --> 01:23:38.014
I guess but I can't
believe what I'm hearing.

01:23:38.181 --> 01:23:41.768
I have to know it all doesn't just end.

01:23:41.935 --> 01:23:45.939
I have to believe part of me keeps going.

01:23:46.106 --> 01:23:47.941
We all got a soul.

01:23:48.108 --> 01:23:49.192
Right Father?

01:23:52.987 --> 01:23:54.614
First a murderer,

01:23:55.448 --> 01:23:57.534
then he becomes a Christian.

01:23:57.826 --> 01:24:00.120
What did I do to deserve this?

01:24:00.286 --> 01:24:01.287
Which is worse?

01:24:01.454 --> 01:24:02.580
He explained it to you...

01:24:02.789 --> 01:24:05.125
The Jews don't have an afterlife.

01:24:05.375 --> 01:24:07.877
We're all afraid of dying Marty.

01:24:08.128 --> 01:24:11.798
But we don't give up the
religion we're born into.

01:24:12.090 --> 01:24:13.758
I'm not afraid of dying.

01:24:14.426 --> 01:24:17.679
You're too stupid to
appreciate the implications.

01:24:17.846 --> 01:24:20.140
I didn't say I like the idea.

01:24:20.306 --> 01:24:23.143
And I'll resist death
with everything I have.

01:24:23.309 --> 01:24:27.605
But when the Angel of Death comes
with his scythe to cut me down,

01:24:27.772 --> 01:24:28.898
I'll go.

01:24:29.941 --> 01:24:31.234
I'll protest.

01:24:31.568 --> 01:24:32.652
I'll curse.

01:24:32.819 --> 01:24:33.945
You hear me?

01:24:34.612 --> 01:24:35.989
I'll go under protest!

01:24:36.239 --> 01:24:37.657
Protest to who?

01:24:38.241 --> 01:24:41.327
What the hell you gonna do?
Write a letter to The Times?

01:24:42.328 --> 01:24:44.456
I'll protest in silence!

01:24:45.039 --> 01:24:48.585
I'll protest because my whole life...
I pray and I pray,

01:24:48.752 --> 01:24:50.503
and there's never an answer!

01:24:54.257 --> 01:24:55.467
What are you saying?

01:24:55.884 --> 01:24:58.803
No answer is also an answer.

01:25:00.346 --> 01:25:03.808
Too bad the Jewish religion
doesn't have an afterlife.

01:25:04.017 --> 01:25:06.686
They would get a lot more customers.

01:25:08.396 --> 01:25:11.733
In late July, Ben was
executed at Sing Sing.

01:25:12.025 --> 01:25:15.695
He died a Christian and stated
he wanted to be cremated.

01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:19.449
Ben requested his ashes be
scattered in Manhattan.

01:25:19.616 --> 01:25:22.285
And Bobby scattered them
outside an establishment

01:25:22.452 --> 01:25:25.538
that had given Ben many
evenings of pleasure.

01:25:36.257 --> 01:25:38.676
Bobby's friends, Rad
Taylor and her husband,

01:25:38.843 --> 01:25:40.386
stepped up to help Bobby.

01:25:40.553 --> 01:25:44.057
and arranged financially to
take over the club and run it.

01:25:44.224 --> 01:25:46.392
And the scandal of its gangster charisma...

01:25:46.559 --> 01:25:49.646
increased the public's fascination with it.

01:26:12.544 --> 01:26:15.380
Certain investors asked them
to go out to California,

01:26:15.547 --> 01:26:18.883
and explore the idea of opening
a nightclub in Hollywood.

01:26:19.133 --> 01:26:22.220
This time he could afford to
stay at the same exclusive place

01:26:22.387 --> 01:26:24.722
where Rad and Steve always stopped at.

01:26:24.889 --> 01:26:26.558
Of course, he looked up Vonnie.

01:26:29.978 --> 01:26:33.189
This is the exact table
where I took your hand...

01:26:33.356 --> 01:26:36.776
and you told me you had a
journalist boyfriend named Doug.

01:26:37.527 --> 01:26:38.778
I remember.

01:26:42.073 --> 01:26:43.825
So will you open a club here?

01:26:43.992 --> 01:26:46.286
No, Hollywood already has its great clubs.

01:26:46.452 --> 01:26:48.913
I don't want to compete
with the Coconut Grove.

01:26:49.289 --> 01:26:53.209
Phil and I will be stopping in New York for
a brief time on the way back from London,

01:26:53.376 --> 01:26:55.670
we're going to spend Christmas
week with Willie Wyler.

01:26:55.837 --> 01:26:58.089
The boys want to go to this New
Years Eve party in New York so...

01:26:58.256 --> 01:27:00.049
I guess I won't be seeing you.

01:27:00.758 --> 01:27:04.387
Maybe it's just as well we
don't...see each other.

01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:07.140
It always...

01:27:07.682 --> 01:27:09.517
stirs up feelings and...

01:27:09.684 --> 01:27:11.352
I start dreaming...

01:27:12.478 --> 01:27:14.147
You probably start dreaming.

01:27:14.439 --> 01:27:15.982
And dreams are...

01:27:17.859 --> 01:27:19.027
they're dreams.

01:27:21.195 --> 01:27:23.823
I guess some feelings never die.

01:27:24.198 --> 01:27:25.783
Is that good or bad?

01:27:28.202 --> 01:27:31.831
And as a beautiful dusk
sky enveloped New York...

01:27:31.998 --> 01:27:34.250
the year came to a close.

01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:39.839
How do I look?

01:27:40.757 --> 01:27:41.758
Wow, beautiful!

01:27:42.675 --> 01:27:44.010
Can you tell I'm pregnant?

01:27:44.177 --> 01:27:45.219
No, not at all!

01:27:45.386 --> 01:27:49.641
In fact you have the same
girlish figure you always had.

01:27:50.183 --> 01:27:51.184
It's true.

01:27:51.351 --> 01:27:52.560
Here, help me.

01:27:57.523 --> 01:27:59.067
Can I ask you a question?

01:28:02.278 --> 01:28:03.947
You ever cheated on me?

01:28:07.075 --> 01:28:08.952
Why would you ask that? No.

01:28:11.537 --> 01:28:14.457
I had a dream that when
you were in Hollywood,

01:28:14.624 --> 01:28:17.835
you slept with your old
girlfriend who has my name.

01:28:20.546 --> 01:28:22.465
Dreams are dreams.

01:28:33.977 --> 01:28:36.604
This is the happiest couple I know...

01:28:36.771 --> 01:28:40.066
It's a perfect marriage. Tell
us please, what is your secret?

01:28:41.234 --> 01:28:42.318
What is our secret?

01:28:43.277 --> 01:28:44.070
You tell them...

01:28:44.237 --> 01:28:46.114
We share the same interests...

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.991
like the same movies,

01:28:48.157 --> 01:28:49.575
we both love children...

01:28:50.076 --> 01:28:52.161
- Other peoples!
- Ok!

01:28:52.578 --> 01:28:55.081
Time flies, another milestone...

01:28:55.248 --> 01:28:58.042
on a bewildering journey leading where?

01:28:58.209 --> 01:28:59.711
And why?

01:29:00.878 --> 01:29:02.547
It's been an awful year.

01:29:02.714 --> 01:29:04.632
Lets turn the page and move on.

01:29:04.799 --> 01:29:06.384
You're right, you're right.

01:29:06.968 --> 01:29:10.096
I was pondering the relentlessness of time.

01:29:10.263 --> 01:29:14.684
Socrates said: "The unexamined
life is not worth living."

01:29:15.101 --> 01:29:18.021
But the examined one is no bargain.

01:29:29.407 --> 01:29:30.116
10 !

01:29:30.283 --> 01:29:31.159
9 !

01:29:31.325 --> 01:29:32.160
8 !

01:29:38.875 --> 01:29:40.710
Happy New Year!

01:29:55.433 --> 01:29:57.685
- Happy New Year.
- You too. I love you.

01:29:59.479 --> 01:30:00.938
Happy New Year. You too.

01:30:03.566 --> 01:30:05.151
Happy New Year, Bobby!

01:30:08.905 --> 01:30:11.199
You have that far-out look in your eye.

01:30:11.574 --> 01:30:13.743
- Do I?
- What are you thinking?

01:30:14.994 --> 01:30:16.662
Nothing. Just that er...

01:30:17.205 --> 01:30:19.040
the year is changing.

01:30:19.624 --> 01:30:20.666
It is!

01:30:44.107 --> 01:30:46.109
Happy New Year my love.

01:30:46.275 --> 01:30:49.946
You make every year a new
and happy year for me.

01:30:51.531 --> 01:30:53.199
Thank you, that's very sweet.

01:30:53.366 --> 01:30:54.617
What are you thinking?

01:30:55.952 --> 01:30:57.537
Nothing, I'm fine.

01:30:58.204 --> 01:30:59.956
Your eyes look so dreamy.

01:31:00.123 --> 01:31:01.165
Do they?

01:31:02.305 --> 01:31:08.902
