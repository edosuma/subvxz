English text using timing of 
German version by Vassago HF! 

00:05.701 --> 00:07.700
Everybody lies once in a while.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.200
Hey Joe. Those mutton chops - 
totally working for you.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.500
Hey. Aww, is that the tie 
Rose picked out for you?

00:15.550 --> 00:16.400
No.

00:16.401 --> 00:19.100
Oh. It's nice.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.399
Or, maybe telling little lies 
isn't so bad.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.850
For example, I should have lied 
and said Rose bought this tie.

00:25.550 --> 00:26.950
Once the black box is activated, 

00:26.951 --> 00:29.500
it can detect any lie 
told by anybody in the room

00:29.501 --> 00:33.200
It analyses speech sound waves and can
identify the distortion in our voices

00:33.201 --> 00:35.100
created by the stress of lying.

00:35.101 --> 00:37.200
And it doesn't work at all!

00:37.401 --> 00:39.000
See, it does work.

00:39.001 --> 00:41.000
I never had any doubt.

00:41.001 --> 00:43.199
OK, I had a small doubt.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.399
OK, every day I am incapacitated by fear. 

00:45.400 --> 00:48.050
I don't know where the magic
comes from and I'm terrified that

00:48.051 --> 00:49.900
one day I'll wake up and it will all be gone.

00:49.901 --> 00:53.250
And I'll end up alone, living in my
brother's basement with his trains. 

00:54.500 --> 00:56.201
Buzz, damn you!

00:56.202 --> 00:58.899
Meanwhile, back at a place of business.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.001
Since we're marketing this 
for the military

01:00.002 --> 01:02.600
we have given this project 
our top level security clearance.

01:02.700 --> 01:04.400
Currently, we're the only people 
who know about it.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.200
Alright! I told my shrink. 

01:07.201 --> 01:09.699
He says it's because I want him 
to think I'm important. 

01:09.700 --> 01:11.900
Let me try.

01:12.050 --> 01:14.250
Every spring, on a remote island,

01:14.251 --> 01:17.600
Sean Connery and I hunt the most
dangerous game: man. 

01:18.900 --> 01:20.500
I've also poisoned one of you. 

01:21.700 --> 01:25.800
And before this day is done, I'm going 
to force two of you to make love. 

01:27.500 --> 01:30.399
Oh my god, I'm dying. I can't breathe.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.199
Good luck you two. Don't let 
the intimacy hurt the friendship.

01:33.200 --> 01:37.199
Relax, I'm lying. I'm able to will
myself to believe whatever I say. 

01:37.200 --> 01:39.099
That's why your machine couldn't tell.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.400
As Veronica has demonstrated with her
alarming mixture of sex and death,

01:42.401 --> 01:44.300
you two need to recalibrate this,

01:44.301 --> 01:46.800
so that even she can't fool it.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.899
Hey, it's my favourite people.

01:49.900 --> 01:53.099
- Chet, what can I do for you sir?
- Actually, I'm here to see Ted. 

01:53.100 --> 01:56.899
Are you and your daughter still up for
miniature golf today with me and Olivia?

01:56.900 --> 01:58.000
Looking forward to it, sir. 

01:58.001 --> 02:00.200
Excellent. I've got my clubs 
and I am going to beat you. 

02:02.501 --> 02:04.201
Oh my, that didn't come out right.

02:04.202 --> 02:07.299
Don't worry, I've never hit anyone 
with a golf club.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.000
At least not on purpose.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.899
Hey what's this fun machine? 

02:10.900 --> 02:12.300
Just a random buzzer.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.299
It's working!

02:14.300 --> 02:17.600
I've got to get back upstairs 
and put some more evil into the world.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.899
What did you think, you're elves 
in the North Pole? 

02:22.900 --> 02:25.100
You know where you work. 

02:28.001 --> 02:30.899
So, you're jetting off for a glamorous
golf game with the boss.

02:30.900 --> 02:34.400
It's hardly glamorous. 
On the final hole you have to putt
the ball into the mouth of a rabbit, 

02:34.401 --> 02:37.000
who for copyright reasons 
is named Shmugs Shmunny.

02:37.001 --> 02:39.199
It's not fair. All you people
with your kids,

02:39.200 --> 02:42.499
palling around after hours, 
networking, advancing your careers. 

02:42.500 --> 02:43.300
And I get left behind, 

02:43.301 --> 02:46.599
just because I don't want to turn
my uterus into a human veal farm.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.499
Well some call it the Miracle of Life,
but OK.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.800
Look, Chet's daughter Olivia and Rose
both go to the Veridian aftercare program 

02:52.801 --> 02:56.399
and they've gotten to be friends.
Like 2 cutlets in a scaloppini. 

02:56.400 --> 02:59.001
So I figured it would be good to get 
some face time with the boss. 

02:59.002 --> 03:02.199
Just be careful, Ted. There's a reason
it's called the kid mafia. 

03:02.200 --> 03:03.299
Because you started calling it that?

03:03.300 --> 03:06.100
Yes, and because one minute 
you're flying high with Chet,

03:06.101 --> 03:08.800
and the next you're buried in the desert
with a bullet in your skull.

03:08.801 --> 03:10.699
Or whatever the kid equivalent is.

03:10.700 --> 03:12.900
Probably something with poo.

03:14.250 --> 03:17.700
This is my calm voice! 
Do you want to hear my uncalm voice?

03:19.501 --> 03:20.301
Damn it!

03:20.500 --> 03:22.399
Wow, Linda seems pretty upset.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.399
- Yeah, someone should do something.
- Definitely.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.299
- You mean someone else, right?
- Ideally.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.400
Well, we could. 
We are her friends. 

03:29.401 --> 03:32.899
Yeah, but does she consider us 
close friends. Close enough 
to let us carry her burdens. 

03:32.900 --> 03:36.199
If we were walking along the beach, 
would there be three sets of footprints
or two, or none?

03:36.200 --> 03:39.299
I consider you close enough 
to hear everything you're saying.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.950
Hey Linda. How's it going?

03:41.400 --> 03:45.049
My brother smashed up my car 
and I need $5000 to get it fixed.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.800
The company said they wouldn't advance it to me, 

03:46.801 --> 03:50.000
unless I agreed to carry a cloned orangutan to term.

03:50.001 --> 03:52.500
I wouldn't do it. 
Orangutan arms are so long,

03:52.501 --> 03:54.699
they poke out way before 
the rest of them.

03:54.700 --> 03:58.600
The last 2 weeks of the pregnancy, they'll
be picking up everything you drop. 

03:58.650 --> 04:00.850
Thank you. 
Finally I have a good reason 

04:00.851 --> 04:03.501
not to be implanted with 
an orangutan embryo.

04:03.502 --> 04:06.700
Hey, what if we loaned you the money? 

04:06.701 --> 04:07.249
Yeah.

04:07.250 --> 04:10.199
Oh, you guys are sweet. But I can't
borrow money from you.

04:10.200 --> 04:14.151
Of course not. Only a really good friend
would feel comfortable enough 
to borrow money.

04:14.152 --> 04:17.951
We over-reached. We have been rightfully
shamed and we shall now take our leave.

04:17.952 --> 04:22.299
- Guys, you are my friends.
- Then prove it and take our money. 

04:22.300 --> 04:25.201
- Do it, Linda. Talk is cheap.
- All right. I'll take your money.

04:25.202 --> 04:27.400
Excellent. Then it's time 
to lower the gangplank

04:27.401 --> 04:30.000
and welcome you 
aboard the Friend ship.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.150
Please don't judge us for that.

04:36.450 --> 04:39.200
Look at that. I've never seen
Olivia so crazy for anyone

04:39.201 --> 04:43.200
as she is for your daughter. Kids,
there's just no rhyme or reason

04:43.201 --> 04:46.049
to some of the ridiculous things
they get attached to. 

04:46.050 --> 04:47.499
Yeah. Wait, what? 

04:47.500 --> 04:49.849
Olivia used to play with
Joe Mullen's daughter 

04:49.850 --> 04:53.499
but that girl was relentlessly
competitive, and good at things.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.700
- Joe Mullen, wasn't he recently
  transferred to Nigeria?
- Yeah. 

04:56.850 --> 04:59.300
I remember he was nervous 
about all the kidnappings.

04:59.350 --> 05:02.899
- He described it as a ransom-based
economy. 
- Yeah.

05:02.900 --> 05:06.000
I'm sure he lives in constant fear. 

05:06.001 --> 05:08.199
- It's not fair. 
- What's the matter, sweetheart?

05:08.200 --> 05:11.899
Rose keeps winning. If I'm 
so special, why aren't I winning?  

05:11.900 --> 05:15.499
Maybe you're just not special at golf.
You're special at screaming really loud. 

05:15.500 --> 05:18.599
Hey Olivia, don't worry about it.
There's still another hole left 

05:18.600 --> 05:22.350
and that is the only hole that matters.
Whoever wins that one, wins the whole game. 

05:22.900 --> 05:27.199
- What are you talking about? 
- Just go tee up. 

05:27.200 --> 05:31.799
Nicely handled, Ted. Hey we have
the Galaxy Omega project coming up. 

05:31.800 --> 05:34.699
I think it could benefit 
from your people skills. 

05:34.700 --> 05:36.899
Boy, I'd love to be part 
of Galaxy Omega. 

05:36.900 --> 05:38.899
It's going to change the way
we communicate with animals,

05:38.900 --> 05:42.699
which up until now has been talking
to them, getting frustrated 
with them and then eating them. 

05:42.700 --> 05:45.050
Come by my office 
and we'll talk about it.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.689
Hit it. 

05:47.699 --> 05:48.599
Honey, 

05:48.600 --> 05:52.250
Hey, I have a fun idea.
Why don't you let Olivia win.  

05:52.900 --> 05:54.800
There's nothing more fun than 
losing on purpose. 

05:54.801 --> 05:57.101
What's happened to you? 

05:58.550 --> 06:02.749
Great, instead of working on the company's 
most exciting project, I'll get canned. 

06:02.750 --> 06:04.400
God forbid she loses 
at miniature golf. 

06:04.600 --> 06:07.500
Olivia sank it in 2, Ted.
Heaven help us all.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:16.080 --> 06:19.199
I'm just thinking about Rose.
She would hate Nigeria. 

06:19.200 --> 06:21.600
You know what they say, it's not just
the heat, it's the driving around 

06:21.601 --> 06:24.350
in the trunk of a car, not knowing
if you're going to live or die. 

06:25.500 --> 06:30.000
Where's my ball?
<i>Where's my ball?</i>

06:30.001 --> 06:34.101
- It flew into the bushes. 
- Flew? Or was kicked? 

06:34.200 --> 06:36.200
OK, you know how I pretend 
not to see

06:36.201 --> 06:37.999
when you hide your peas 
under your mashed potatoes?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.250
Can you just cut me 
a little of that? 

06:43.000 --> 06:44.599
Guys, I really appreciate this loan. 

06:44.600 --> 06:47.350
Now I can get my car fixed and stop
commuting with Mutton-Chop Joe, 

06:47.351 --> 06:50.849
who, big surprise, is the president 
of the virginity club at his church.

06:50.850 --> 06:53.800
Hey, since we're such good friends, 
how would you like to join us this weekend

06:53.801 --> 06:56.699
for a little adventure we call, 
"Bowling and Nachos". 

06:56.700 --> 06:58.549
We go bowling and we order nachos. 

06:58.550 --> 07:00.000
My! That is an adventure.

07:00.001 --> 07:02.899
- But, we don't eat the nachos. 
- No, we do not. 

07:02.900 --> 07:05.300
We bring them back to the lab
and analyze the cheese sauce 

07:05.301 --> 07:07.599
to determine how much of it
is actual cheese. 

07:07.600 --> 07:10.099
If one of us bowls a higher score
than the percentage of cheese,

07:10.100 --> 07:11.800
then we get blasted.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.649
I do like bowling and I love
getting blasted,

07:14.650 --> 07:17.399
but I can't. I have to work.
What's that?

07:17.400 --> 07:19.000
Just something we invented
that buzzes.

07:19.360 --> 07:22.899
Hey, we can't all be Thomas Edison.
But more about this work you have to do. 

07:22.900 --> 07:24.320
Yeah, I've got this big report.

07:24.900 --> 07:25.800
That's due Monday. 

07:26.300 --> 07:29.399
So I gotta work on it all weekend.
That thing's really annoying

07:29.400 --> 07:31.950
Well I'm certainly glad you're taking
our money, Linda.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.150
God, I'm pathetic.

07:37.300 --> 07:40.100
I didn't feel good about sabotaging
my daughter at minigolf. 

07:40.101 --> 07:43.801
I made it up to her. Although I'm not
super proud of how I did that either. 

07:46.900 --> 07:50.100
Aren't these good root beer floats?
I'm sorry, honey. 

07:50.101 --> 07:52.201
Please forgive me. 

07:58.150 --> 08:01.600
- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetheart. Hi.

08:01.700 --> 08:04.899
- How's your day?
- A grind. I don't like Olivia anymore. 

08:04.900 --> 08:07.199
And now she wants me to go
to her birthday. 

08:07.200 --> 08:12.100
Well, you don't have to go. Unless
you change your mind. Because there's
going to be cake. 

08:12.180 --> 08:14.399
And on the way you can sit on my lap
and drive the car. 

08:14.400 --> 08:15.800
And I'll let you cut Daddy's hair

08:15.850 --> 08:17.749
I'm going to go grab my lunchbox. 

08:17.750 --> 08:19.910
When I come back, you try 
not to be weird. 

08:21.700 --> 08:26.799
Hello, Ted. Ooh, I like this place.
It makes me feel so tall and busty. 

08:26.850 --> 08:29.599
Yeah, that's why I come. 
So, what are you doing down here. 

08:29.600 --> 08:31.000
I've joined the kid mafia. 

08:31.001 --> 08:33.500
You're not the only ass-kissing
career whore. 

08:34.250 --> 08:35.799
What are you looking at?

08:36.150 --> 08:39.399
I'm not going to let Chet go over my head
and give you the Galaxy Omega project, 

08:39.400 --> 08:42.198
- just because you have a daughter.
- It really makes you crazy, 

08:42.200 --> 08:44.299
that I might get something 
that you can't have, doesn't it?

08:44.300 --> 08:46.700
Plus, you can't join the kid mafia
without a kid.

08:46.720 --> 08:50.000
I do have a kid. It's my niece.
We're very close. 

08:50.001 --> 08:52.470
- Hello, Luthy!
- Hannah.

08:52.475 --> 08:56.009
Everything's a fight with you.
So, did you play with Olivia today? 

08:56.010 --> 08:58.850
A little bit. The girl I really like
is Rose. 

08:58.851 --> 09:00.700
Rose? Rose gets us nothing. 

09:00.720 --> 09:02.699
Teddy-o! Veronica. 

09:02.700 --> 09:06.720
Sometimes, adding an "y-o" just makes
a name more fun. 

09:06.730 --> 09:09.000
Although it doesn't work 
with Veronica. 

09:09.001 --> 09:12.901
- Might I suggest the Veronica-meister.
 - We'll see.

09:13.150 --> 09:15.429
So Chet, my niece just joined this gym,

09:15.430 --> 09:18.600
and she's gotten very close to Olivia 
and would love to get together with her. 

09:18.640 --> 09:20.050
Maybe for lunch or drinks? 

09:20.330 --> 09:23.899
Olivia is having a birthday this weekend. 
Maybe she'd like to come to that. 

09:23.900 --> 09:26.799
We'll be there. It'll be a perfect chance
for me to talk to you, 

09:26.800 --> 09:29.199
about why I should be in charge
of the Galaxy Omega project. 

09:29.200 --> 09:32.279
Rose and I'll be there too, sir. 
Because Rose loves Olivia.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.800
So, I guess we'll both 
be at your daughter's birthday.

09:34.801 --> 09:36.801
Where is she registered, sir? 

09:39.150 --> 09:41.910
How do you convince an eight-year old girl
to go to a party she doesn't want to?

09:41.911 --> 09:45.139
I have no idea. So I
thought I'd asked someone

09:45.140 --> 09:46.640
who used to be an eight-year old girl.

09:46.700 --> 09:50.685
Get her a beautiful sparky pink
party dress, and a princess tiara.

09:51.001 --> 09:53.499
If she doesn't want it, I have
an event coming up, I'd wear it too.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.399
Actually, getting Rose
a dress is a good idea.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.700
- Thanks Linda. You really are a girl.
- Yes I am.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.920
And it's not just the genitals.
It's a whole lifestyle.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.349
Ted, Ted. How much do you
know about your precious Linda?

10:09.350 --> 10:11.499
Specifically,
did you know she's a huge liar?

10:11.500 --> 10:14.199
We thought we were friends but she made
up some story about having a work

10:14.200 --> 10:16.339
so she could avoid hanging out
with us this weekend.

10:16.340 --> 10:19.199
Our self-respect
demands a harsh response.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.199
We were thinking about bringing her
a coffee and a bagel every morning.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.900
Then, when she's grown accustomed to it,
we'll inexplicably stop.

10:25.950 --> 10:29.700
Guys, why don't you just talk to Linda?
Tell her your feelings are hurt and...

10:30.130 --> 10:33.799
Wait a second.You guys stopped bringing
me a bagel and coffee two weeks ago.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.500
You know what you did.

10:37.080 --> 10:40.939
Maybe Ted's right. Maybe we should talk
to Linda, that is what friends do.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.599
- It's hard being friends with girls.
- It's hard being friends with guys.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.000
I wish there was a third gender.
Something with boobs

10:46.001 --> 10:48.539
that was incapable of judgment.

10:48.540 --> 10:52.349
So,I just wanna go over the plans for saturday.
Everybody should try to get to my place by 8.

10:52.350 --> 10:55.299
And be prepared to stay late.
This thing could get kinda crazy.

10:55.300 --> 10:59.900
Oh, yeah. Beer, hard licker,
everything. Even strippers.

11:02.050 --> 11:05.030
She's having a party. That's
why she's not hanging out with us.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.299
And they are going to wear slippers.
Those things are so comfortable.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.799
And she didn't invite us?
What kind of a friend does that?

11:10.800 --> 11:13.400
Let's get her a bagel
and some coffee. It's the time,

11:13.401 --> 11:17.400
to start laying the ground work for pain,
in three to six weeks she's not going to know

11:17.401 --> 11:18.900
what hit her.

11:19.650 --> 11:21.800
I don't know if I can wait that long.

11:21.850 --> 11:23.780
We need an another plan.
Something with more bite

11:23.790 --> 11:26.900
that doesn't take weeks and weeks
and often goes unnoticed.

11:32.800 --> 11:36.939
- Hi, Ted. Where is Rose?
- She is around here somewhere.

11:36.940 --> 11:40.379
Oh, really? Because I saw you both get
out of the car and it was just you.

11:40.380 --> 11:43.560
Did you drive seperately? Did you
shrink her and put her in your pocket?

11:43.570 --> 11:45.550
Okay, I couldn't get Rose to come.
I figured

11:45.551 --> 11:47.150
since there'd a million kids here,
I could bring a present,

11:47.151 --> 11:49.499
carry her sweater and nobody
would know the difference.

11:49.500 --> 11:53.499
Oh, Ted. I can't believe what you
are doing to get Galaxy Omega project.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.700
It's all so sad and desperate.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.500
- Can I have some more tokens?
- Of course, Hannah.

11:59.130 --> 12:02.699
- What? That's my niece's name,isn't it?
- Yes, but that's not your niece.

12:02.700 --> 12:03.450
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

12:03.451 --> 12:04.420
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

12:04.421 --> 12:05.360
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

12:05.361 --> 12:06.300
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

12:06.301 --> 12:07.130
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

12:07.131 --> 12:08.860
- Yes, it is.
- We could do this all night.

12:08.861 --> 12:09.700
Yes, it is.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.499
Sweetheart, what's your name?
You want me to call somebody?

12:12.500 --> 12:15.749
Alright, I borrowed my neighbour's kid.
Here's some more tokens.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.780
Go be nice to the birthday girl.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.630
My sister pulled the plug on Hannah
when she found out

12:20.631 --> 12:22.451
that I was using her for my career.

12:22.452 --> 12:24.799
She thought I developed a genuine
interest in the child.

12:24.800 --> 12:28.119
What really hurts on all this is
that how little my own sister knows me.

12:28.120 --> 12:31.499
And you called me desperate. Veronica,
you are never gonna pull this off.

12:31.500 --> 12:35.650
That girl is at least 2 years older.
She's taller,her eyes are different colour

12:36.080 --> 12:39.400
- She's a different human being.
- You're just freakishly observant.

12:39.730 --> 12:44.249
Unless it's a big take it item, like
race, or not being a sweater, no-one's gonna notice.

12:44.250 --> 12:49.100
Veronica, there's something odd about
your niece. She doesn't look quite right

12:51.700 --> 12:56.800
Hey-o, you see that? I put a hat on
her face. Hats don't belong there.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.300
Inspring lunatism.

12:59.330 --> 13:02.700
I'm glad you both made it.
That wiesel Bob Simmons said

13:02.701 --> 13:05.599
he and his daughter we're coming
and they didn't even show up.

13:05.601 --> 13:08.750
- What kind of a man does that?
- A villain, sir.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.030
He should be forced to carry
an orang-utan.

13:11.385 --> 13:14.749
Where's Rose? Olivia's been asking
for her since we got here.

13:14.750 --> 13:19.700
Rose is, buried in the ball pit.
You saw her, didn't you?

13:19.701 --> 13:23.779
- You and your real niece.
- Yes, we did.

13:24.820 --> 13:25.846
For now.

13:25.870 --> 13:28.839
Good. So, my daughter is here,
Veronica's real niece is here.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.900
Everything is as it should be.

13:36.840 --> 13:39.280
Lying, it's always wrong.

13:39.540 --> 13:43.799
But sometimes companies have to say
things that aren't 100% true.

13:43.800 --> 13:48.600
Is that wrong? No.
When companies aren't truthful,

13:48.601 --> 13:53.270
it's not because we are bad. It's
because we understand things you don't.

13:55.330 --> 13:59.900
People lie. Companies protect their
interest. It's different.

14:05.400 --> 14:09.499
This is it. This is where Linda and her
beautiful friends are having a party.

14:09.500 --> 14:14.350
A party which we shall destroy with
our uncomfortable, silent anger.

14:14.840 --> 14:17.350
- Now, what's the plan?
- Get drunk, done.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.350
Walk 10 miles from bar to Linda's
place, done.

14:20.351 --> 14:22.300
Get chased by a homeless guy
with a stick

14:22.301 --> 14:24.100
which we didn't plan, but done.

14:24.200 --> 14:28.050
Keep down the tequila which is
coming back on me, done.

14:28.340 --> 14:31.700
Mom, dad, Father Todd. I'm grateful
that we could all be here tonight

14:31.701 --> 14:33.850
to save my beautiful brother Justin.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.926
Justin, your drinking has affected
me in the following ways...

14:36.927 --> 14:39.200
Yazoo, bitches!

14:39.201 --> 14:42.001
You're busted, our little liar
friend, you're not at work,

14:42.200 --> 14:45.260
- you're having a party.
- This is so not a party.

14:45.261 --> 14:49.400
Oh, come on. Peanuts, people crying,
a priest. That's a party, baby.

14:49.401 --> 14:52.800
Yeah, stripper priest.
Take it off, father sexy.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.500
You idiots.
We're having an intervention.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.080
Next time you talk to god, could
you not mention this?

15:03.450 --> 15:07.950
Here, we're done drinking tonight.
Just keep it away from the alcoholics.

15:15.900 --> 15:20.100
Working on Galaxy Omega would be so exciting.
Being able to communicate with animals.

15:20.300 --> 15:23.342
I've always wanted to tell a giraffe
how stupid it looks.

15:23.343 --> 15:27.100
I've always wanted to ask a baboon
why they are called baboons.

15:27.101 --> 15:29.200
It's such a ridiculous name.

15:29.201 --> 15:30.600
Baboon.

15:30.670 --> 15:33.568
And there might be other aplications
beyond insulting animals.

15:33.570 --> 15:35.001
Like, learning about the enviroment.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.219
Don't we have enough humans complaining
about that?

15:37.220 --> 15:41.051
Now I have to listen some hippie bear
whining that I'm eating all his salmon.

15:41.052 --> 15:44.499
I can't find Rose. I looked everywhere.
Nobody's seen her.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.570
- I'm sure she's somewhere.
- Maybe she's been murdered.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.050
Oh my God. She hasn't been murdered.
Stop that.

15:50.060 --> 15:52.070
I'm sure she
hasn't been murdered, honey.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.199
Your father's right.
Rose has not been murdered.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.000
Can we stop talking about my daughter
being or not being murdered?

15:57.001 --> 16:00.000
All this talk about murdering Rose
has got me spooked.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.209
And you don't even know where she is.
I'm calling security.

16:02.210 --> 16:03.899
No, no don't do that.

16:03.900 --> 16:07.500
What kind of a father are you?
She is missing, Ted.

16:08.001 --> 16:12.850
You, you, I need an another dietcola.
And this one's daughter is missing.

16:12.851 --> 16:14.400
- We think she's been murdered.
- What?

16:14.401 --> 16:16.019
We do not think that.

16:16.020 --> 16:19.919
Attention. We have a missing child.
Repeat: There is a child missing.

16:19.920 --> 16:23.200
Parents, locate your
children immediately.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.500
Oh, boy.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.039
I'm an off-duty police officer.
Can I help?

16:29.040 --> 16:30.450
- Rose has been murdered.
- What?

16:30.500 --> 16:32.050
No, nobody's been murdered.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.910
Okay, I didn't bring her. I lied.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.850
Rose didn't wanna come. For some
reason she doesn't like Olivia.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.849
Ted, how could you do this?
Lying to me and Chet like that?

16:44.850 --> 16:46.959
Oh, give me a break. That's
not even your niece.

16:46.960 --> 16:50.600
What? Hannah, how could you do this?
Lying to me and chet like that?

16:57.300 --> 17:00.100
The next day, things were little
tense between me and Veronica.

17:00.200 --> 17:04.299
So, we re-calibrated the lie detector so
not even Veronica will be able to fool it.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.700
Or any sociopath.

17:07.010 --> 17:08.950
Not that I think you're a sociopath.

17:09.151 --> 17:10.700
Shut up.

17:10.800 --> 17:14.640
Well, let's try it. Because Ted sold
me out to Chet, I'm missing out on

17:14.641 --> 17:17.800
Veridian's most exciting project since
that pill that makes people shop.

17:18.010 --> 17:19.200
And I'm fine with that.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.270
And I'm glad that last night, at the first
sight of trouble with Chet, Veronica

17:22.271 --> 17:25.000
kicked me in the testicles.

17:25.001 --> 17:27.099
It's weird when beautiful people fight.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.499
It's like watching the Hope Diamond yell
at the sunset.

17:29.500 --> 17:32.040
I've realized recently, I don't
mind anger as much

17:32.041 --> 17:33.776
when it's not directed at me.

17:33.800 --> 17:39.250
Yazoo, Bitches. Oh, I'm sorry, am I bursting
in on something I wasn't invited to?

17:39.251 --> 17:42.800
Upsetting people, giving
liquor to my alcoholic brother,

17:42.840 --> 17:46.850
making my mother cry so hard that
she threw up on father sexy?

17:46.870 --> 17:49.000
We apologized for that last night.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.800
Perhaps you didn't hear us
because we were running away

17:51.801 --> 17:52.700
as fast as we could.

17:53.370 --> 17:55.799
Going to a party, where you don't belong?
Why does that sound familiar?

17:55.800 --> 17:59.299
Because that's what you did, when you
showed up to child party without a child.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.450
You know what the problem is, Veronica?
You can't stand

18:01.451 --> 18:03.450
that I might get a big project that
you are not a part of.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.550
- So you wanna horn in on it.
- That's not true.

18:07.200 --> 18:10.070
And you guys can't stand that I
have an alcoholic brother.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.257
No, that can't be right.

18:11.258 --> 18:14.299
Why did you guys crash my
brother's intervention anyway?

18:14.300 --> 18:16.500
We thought you were having
a party and didn't invite us

18:16.501 --> 18:18.199
even though you said we were friends.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.700
We were friends. Although
after what you did last night, I

18:20.701 --> 18:22.500
don't know if I wanna be friends
with you anymore.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.399
She still wants to be our friend.
Even after all we did.

18:27.400 --> 18:31.700
That's a real friendship. Because
what we did was apalling.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.000
Come here.

18:34.001 --> 18:36.249
Thanks to you, my whole
family is mad at me.

18:36.250 --> 18:39.100
The last thing I need right now
is a hug from you guys.

18:40.901 --> 18:42.001
Let's go hug her.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.100
Okay. It's just you, me,
and the machine.

18:46.360 --> 18:50.100
So admit it. You don't want me to move
up and have success in this company.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.700
Of course I want that for you.

18:54.480 --> 18:57.001
Well, this makes it harder to advance
my argument.

18:57.002 --> 18:58.602
It's the truth, Ted.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.450
It's just, if you join the kid mafia

19:01.451 --> 19:03.950
pretty soon you're gonna be hanging out
with them all the time.

19:03.951 --> 19:08.998
and when I need you, you're not gonna
be around and.. well, you know...

19:10.450 --> 19:12.600
- You'd miss me?
- No!

19:15.530 --> 19:18.700
- And that's as much as you're gonna get.
- Well, I'll take it.

19:19.020 --> 19:22.001
And whatever happens, I will always
not be there for you.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.499
Because our friendship
means nothing to me.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.856
And that's as much as you're gonna get.

19:28.500 --> 19:33.965
Hey-o. Guess who's covered in tiny
8-year old fist sized bruises?

19:33.966 --> 19:35.699
This guy!

19:35.700 --> 19:38.850
So I've decided you both need a little more punishment. 

19:41.940 --> 19:43.600
Well, at least Chet didn't send
us off to Nigeria.

19:43.601 --> 19:46.630
Don't talk. When you exhale,
I can feel it in my face.

19:46.631 --> 19:48.980
You're just mad because I sneezed in
your mouth a minute ago.

19:50.001 --> 19:52.300
Isn't it nice you don't
have to miss me?

19:59.001 --> 20:01.400
This cheese sauce is only 42% cheese.

20:01.401 --> 20:05.380
And since you voted 62, according to the
American rules of "Bowling & Nachos",

20:05.680 --> 20:07.199
we all get to drink.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.800
But first we dance.

20:08.801 --> 20:10.000
	Everybody in da House

20:10.001 --> 20:11.200
Everybody in da House
if you're ready to party

20:11.201 --> 20:12.220
	Everybody in da House
if you're ready to party
let me hear you say.

20:12.221 --> 20:20.300
