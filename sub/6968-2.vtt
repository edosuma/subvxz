00:12.888 --> 00:15.349
(sailors shout in Russian)

01:55.908 --> 01:57.451
Argh!

02:41.908 --> 02:45.051
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 02 - Host

03:28.834 --> 03:32.212
Dave can set it up,
but the cost sounds a bit rich.

03:32.296 --> 03:36.508
If he's putting it together,
you'd be a fool to pass it up.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.969
I hear you. I just...

03:39.094 --> 03:42.598
You just what? You wanna take a dip,
you gotta test the water.

03:42.723 --> 03:47.186
- You just don't wanna get wet.
- No, man. Dippage is sacred.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.063
Dippage is sacred.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.650
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.738
You're relieved from your assignment.
Agent Bozoff will take over.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.116
You've got a flight to catch in 45 minutes.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.453
- Where am I going?
- Murder case. Newark, New Jersey.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.623
Treat yourself.

04:07.831 --> 04:11.668
Your contact in Newark
is a Detective Norman.

04:11.793 --> 04:15.714
- How'd I draw the assignment?
- Assistant Director Skinner requested you.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.007
Skinner requested me?!

04:41.114 --> 04:44.535
- Mulder, FBI.
- My forensics team's just wrapping up.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.829
We left the body where we found it.
Kenny!

04:48.914 --> 04:52.835
This is one case I'm gonna be
happy to turn over to you guys.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.097
Watch yourself.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.433
Yeah. Wouldn't wanna step in anything.

05:12.688 --> 05:16.108
They say it cuts the smell if you
don't breathe through your mouth.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.902
They lied.

05:18.986 --> 05:23.031
- Who found the body?
- Sanitation worker.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.659
Looks like it's been here a while.

05:25.742 --> 05:29.496
- Any ID?
- No. Not much to go on, either.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.166
Front side is pretty much eaten away.

05:32.249 --> 05:36.378
- Would you like us to turn him over?
- No, I'll take your word on that.

05:36.879 --> 05:40.299
Hey, Agent Mulder!
What should we do with the body?

05:40.382 --> 05:45.596
Wrap it up and send it to the FBI,
care of Assistant Director Skinner!

06:02.946 --> 06:05.240
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

06:05.324 --> 06:06.992
I need to speak to him.

06:07.075 --> 06:10.204
Mr Skinner is unavailable.
If you'd take a seat...

06:10.287 --> 06:14.875
Will you tell him that I'm here
and I need to speak to him... now?

06:15.876 --> 06:17.753
Certainly.

06:18.587 --> 06:24.551
Mr Skinner, I'm very sorry to interrupt,
but Agent Mulder is demanding to see you.

06:24.635 --> 06:27.387
- Is there a problem, Agent Mulder?
- Yeah, there is.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.765
Then make an appointment.

06:29.848 --> 06:33.060
That's hard when you're
up to your ass in raw sewage...

06:33.143 --> 06:35.687
...on another meaningless assignment.

06:35.771 --> 06:39.441
- Excuse me?
- What's next? Scrubbing bathroom floors?

06:39.566 --> 06:42.653
- You're out of line, Agent Mulder.
- So I gathered.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.490
Fine.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.701
Come into my office, Agent Mulder. Please.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.543
Would you inform the room...

06:57.626 --> 07:01.797
...as to why you regard your case
in New Jersey as meaningless?

07:03.006 --> 07:05.300
It's a simple drugland body dump...

07:05.425 --> 07:08.762
...not the type of case
the FBI wastes time or manpower on.

07:10.264 --> 07:16.103
Given your recent history, you're not one
to judge what is or is not a waste of time.

07:16.353 --> 07:21.149
- Sir, my work on the <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>...
- The X-Files have been closed, Agent Mulder.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.694
You will carry out new assignments...

07:23.777 --> 07:28.574
...and investigate them to the best
of your ability. Is that not clear?

07:28.657 --> 07:30.701
Yeah.

07:30.784 --> 07:35.289
And I'll be anticipating your field reports
on your current homicide case.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.457
Thank you.

07:50.888 --> 07:53.182
Is this seat taken?

07:54.057 --> 07:58.854
No. But I should warn you,
I'm experiencing violent impulses.

07:58.937 --> 08:02.065
Well, I'm armed, so I'll take my chances.

08:10.741 --> 08:15.537
I hear you really endeared yourself
to Assistant Director Skinner today.

08:17.289 --> 08:22.503
Sometimes it's hard to smile when they
ask you to bend down and grab your ankles.

08:23.086 --> 08:26.590
It's not as if you've ever tried
to fit into the programme.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.383
No.

08:29.009 --> 08:32.136
No, I've been thinking a lot about that lately.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.351
- I've been thinking about leaving.
- The Bureau?

08:37.476 --> 08:39.186
What would you do?

08:39.269 --> 08:42.356
Pursue my work in the
paranormal, somehow.

08:43.857 --> 08:48.987
You could request a transfer to Quantico.
Come back to the behavioural science unit.

08:49.613 --> 08:52.241
They don't want us working together, Scully.

08:52.324 --> 08:55.035
And that's the only reason
I can think of to stay.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.829
What about this case you're working on?

08:57.913 --> 09:01.416
- It's a zero.
- Where's the body?

09:02.084 --> 09:05.838
In our forensics lab.
Look, I know what you're trying to do.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.131
Maybe I can request to do the autopsy.

09:08.257 --> 09:13.220
It's an exercise. Skinner is just
rubbing my nose in this one.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.472
There's nothing to it.

09:15.556 --> 09:18.809
There's a dead body, isn't there?

09:30.279 --> 09:31.738
Oh!

09:38.412 --> 09:44.334
Examination and autopsy of
John Doe number 1-0-1-3-5-6.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.921
Case number DP1-1-2-1-4-8.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.217
Special Agent Fox Mulder, field investigator.

09:53.135 --> 09:58.348
Body is an adult male with
advanced tissue decomposition...

09:58.473 --> 10:02.227
...weighing 165 pounds in extremis...

10:02.895 --> 10:05.439
...69 inches in length.

10:06.315 --> 10:10.235
Intact skin is mottled and discoloured...

10:10.319 --> 10:14.948
...due to submergence in and exposure to
a highly bacterial environment.

10:15.032 --> 10:17.743
Cause and time of death...

10:18.118 --> 10:19.620
...unknown.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.998
Possible identifying mark on right forearm.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.007
Body cavities appear normal.

10:34.218 --> 10:36.678
Interior organs intact...

10:37.387 --> 10:40.516
...consistent in rate of decomposition.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.939
Removing the ribcage.

10:56.198 --> 10:59.326
Condition of heart and lungs are good.

11:00.536 --> 11:04.540
No sign of thrombi,
natural or degenerate diseases.

11:04.623 --> 11:07.751
Indicate victim was probably a young adult.

11:09.294 --> 11:12.297
The liver shows some nodular hardening...

11:12.381 --> 11:15.050
...consistent with incipient alcoholism.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.969
Oh, God!

11:43.036 --> 11:45.581
- It's on the way!
- Got it!

11:47.416 --> 11:49.084
OK.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.573
Need a big piece of 30-gauge
and some baling wire.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.409
I gotta go back up top for the screen.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.643
Frank! Help!

12:48.894 --> 12:51.605
Frank! Frank!

12:52.439 --> 12:54.316
Frank!

12:55.609 --> 12:58.278
Frank! Hurry!

12:58.820 --> 13:00.781
Hold on!

13:00.906 --> 13:03.617
- Frank!
- Come on!

13:03.700 --> 13:04.952
Frank!

13:06.078 --> 13:09.206
Hold on till I tie the line! Hold on!

13:09.873 --> 13:12.709
Pull up, come on! Come on! Come on!

13:14.211 --> 13:16.088
Pull up!

13:22.344 --> 13:24.012
My God!

13:26.181 --> 13:28.475
I'm gonna get help!

13:42.990 --> 13:46.910
I'm gonna give you a tetanus booster,
just as a precaution.

13:47.995 --> 13:53.041
I'd be happy if you just give me something
to get this taste out of my mouth.

13:54.168 --> 13:56.128
Let me take a look.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.462
Ah.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.716
- Any trouble swallowing?
- Uh-uh.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.722
It'll go away.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.559
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

14:11.518 --> 14:15.564
Newark PD referred me to you.
I'm surprised the FBI is involved.

14:15.647 --> 14:20.319
- Is there something here I should know?
- I don't know. Maybe you can tell me.

14:21.236 --> 14:27.034
He's a sanitation worker. He claims he was
attacked by something down in the sewer.

14:27.117 --> 14:30.370
- Attacked? By what?
- We've been unable to determine.

14:30.454 --> 14:35.167
I thought it was a bogus disability claim,
but he appears to be telling the truth.

14:35.250 --> 14:38.504
- What's his condition?
- He's in satisfactory health.

14:38.587 --> 14:44.134
I've given him a heavy course of antibiotics,
and we're checking for hepatitis.

14:44.218 --> 14:47.221
He does have a strange wound on his back.

14:48.764 --> 14:53.268
- What kind of wound?
- It could be some kind of bacterial infection.

14:53.352 --> 14:56.855
Frankly, I can't say
I've ever seen anything like it.

15:03.820 --> 15:07.491
- This is Agent Mulder of the FBI.
- Any idea what attacked you?

15:07.574 --> 15:11.495
- I've been thinking it might've been a python.
- A python?

15:11.578 --> 15:17.125
Or a boa constrictor. Somebody probably
flushed their pet snake down the toilet.

15:18.377 --> 15:21.964
We found an alligator in the sewer
a couple of years ago.

15:22.047 --> 15:26.635
Stronger than hell, I'll tell you that.
Clamped onto me like a vice.

15:27.261 --> 15:29.721
It almost looks like a bite.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.564
Excuse me.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.734
- Mulder.
- Mulder, it's me. I need to see you.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.028
I've got something you should know about.

15:45.153 --> 15:48.740
- What is it?
- Some kind of parasite in your John Doe.

15:48.866 --> 15:51.702
I should know more by the time you get here.

15:51.994 --> 15:56.039
I'm in Jersey. I should be taking
the shuttle in about an hour.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.959
Can I get outta here? I'd like to go home.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.003
Excuse me.

16:01.086 --> 16:04.756
- Scully, this is a bad time for me to talk.
- Mr Mulder?

16:05.549 --> 16:06.466
Yeah?

16:06.592 --> 16:11.138
I think you should know...
you have a friend at the FBI.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.059
Who is this?

16:18.478 --> 16:23.275
Agent Mulder? If you don't have any more
questions, I'm gonna release this man.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.444
OK. Go ahead.

16:36.705 --> 16:39.166
Close the door.

16:43.962 --> 16:48.926
It's called Turbellaria, commonly
known as a fluke, or flatworm.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.220
This was living inside the body?

16:51.303 --> 16:56.517
It had attached itself to the bile duct
and was feeding off the liver.

16:56.642 --> 16:57.809
Lovely!

16:57.935 --> 17:02.648
Believe it or not, some 40 million
people are infected worldwide.

17:02.773 --> 17:07.319
This isn't where you tell me
some terrible story about sushi, is it?

17:07.402 --> 17:11.490
Maybe you'd rather hear what you
can catch from a nice rare steak.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.910
So, what? The murder weapon
was a top sirloin?

17:15.410 --> 17:18.454
Flukes are endemic in unsanitary conditions.

17:18.539 --> 17:22.584
It's more likely that the victim
contracted it down inside the sewer.

17:22.667 --> 17:26.171
- Before or after he died?
- I don't know.

17:27.047 --> 17:31.134
My sources say it's unlikely
a single parasite could have killed him.

17:31.218 --> 17:36.765
He was a young man. But the weird thing is,
there's no other discernible cause of death.

17:37.266 --> 17:40.310
How do these parasites attach themselves?

17:40.435 --> 17:45.774
They have what's called a scolex,
a sucker-like mouth with four hooking spikes.

17:45.858 --> 17:48.485
- Anything like this?
- Where'd you get that?

17:48.569 --> 17:52.656
Something attacked a workman
in a New Jersey sewer this morning.

17:52.739 --> 17:56.326
- And you're asking me if this is from a fluke?
- Could it be?

17:56.410 --> 17:59.496
The scolex is a tiny organ.
This is a huge bite mark.

17:59.621 --> 18:03.041
- How big can these things get?
- Mulder, I...

18:05.669 --> 18:07.462
I'm sorry.

18:07.546 --> 18:10.591
It felt like old times there for a second.

18:13.552 --> 18:18.682
Flatworms are what are known
as obligate endoparasites.

18:18.807 --> 18:21.268
They live inside of the host...

18:21.393 --> 18:25.480
...entering the body through
the ingestion of larvae or eggs.

18:25.564 --> 18:28.901
They are not creatures that
go around attacking people.

18:29.026 --> 18:32.029
That's good. I didn't wanna tell Skinner...

18:32.112 --> 18:35.866
...his murder suspect was
a giant bloodsucking worm.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.326
No.

18:38.785 --> 18:44.583
Well, at the very least, this'll be interesting
to the Newark Department of Sanitation.

18:48.795 --> 18:53.759
Look, I don't know who you shared
our conversation with the other night, but...

18:53.842 --> 18:57.429
...I'd prefer it if you didn't
try to launch a campaign for me.

18:57.554 --> 19:00.182
- Excuse me?
- I don't know who you talked to.

19:00.265 --> 19:04.770
- I didn't talk to anybody.
- Somebody told me I had a friend at the FBI.

19:06.939 --> 19:13.362
Look, Mulder, I... I don't know what to say.
But I... I wouldn't betray a confidence.

20:42.534 --> 20:45.078
The city runs on different systems...

20:45.204 --> 20:48.373
...some new, some built
at the turn of the century.

20:48.457 --> 20:52.211
- Almost as old as Charlie. Right, Charlie?
- Oh, yes, sir.

20:52.503 --> 20:57.049
- What part of the sewer was I in?
- An older section. Big eight-foot tunnels.

20:57.591 --> 21:00.219
It looked more like a catacomb
than a sewer line.

21:00.302 --> 21:03.639
The new sections are concrete pipe,
mostly 24 inches.

21:03.931 --> 21:06.642
And all the sewage
comes through this plant?

21:06.725 --> 21:11.522
560,000 people a day call my office
on the porcelain telephone.

21:12.898 --> 21:15.526
Have you ever seen one of these?

21:18.529 --> 21:21.365
It looks like a big old worm.

21:21.448 --> 21:24.868
It's called a fluke. It came
from the body in the sewer.

21:25.244 --> 21:30.958
Wouldn't surprise me. No telling what's been
breeding down there in the last 100 years.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.600
Ray here.

22:30.017 --> 22:32.227
Charlie, slow down.

22:36.106 --> 22:39.276
I'm backflushing the system. It's in there.

22:39.359 --> 22:42.696
- What is it?
- I don't know. It just swam right past me.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.656
There it is.

23:07.471 --> 23:13.727
Turbellarian flatworms are carnivorous
scavengers, less than 3cm in length...

23:13.852 --> 23:18.148
...found in fresh and sea water.
They are hermaphroditic...

23:18.232 --> 23:23.612
...with complex reproductive systems,
capable of internal fertilisation.

23:23.695 --> 23:27.699
Many species require more than
one host to complete a life cycle.

23:27.783 --> 23:32.663
Although the wound on the sanitation worker
suggests scolex attachment...

23:32.788 --> 23:37.835
...the sheer size of the wound precludes
involvement of the common fluke worm.

24:57.581 --> 25:00.042
- Scully.
- Scully, it's me.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.419
- You know that fluke you caught?
- Yeah.

25:02.503 --> 25:04.630
It must've been the runt of the litter.

25:06.798 --> 25:09.009
I don't see it.

25:11.929 --> 25:16.099
There it is. Tucked away in the
far corner behind the pipes.

25:17.726 --> 25:20.395
- Oh, my God.
- I don't know if you can see...

25:20.479 --> 25:24.066
...but it has no sex organs. It's genderless.

25:24.191 --> 25:27.694
Platyhelminthes are often hermaphroditic.

25:27.778 --> 25:29.655
Mulder, this is amazing!

25:29.905 --> 25:34.493
Its vestigial features seem parasitic,
but it has primate physiology.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.954
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.

25:37.037 --> 25:42.751
But I'll have to tell Skinner that his suspect
is a giant bloodsucking worm after all.

25:43.836 --> 25:47.673
All we're missing is the identity
of the body in the sewer.

25:47.756 --> 25:52.302
He was a Russian.
An engineer on a cargo freighter.

25:52.386 --> 25:57.766
He had a tattoo on his forearm. I didn't
make the connection until I detected...

25:57.850 --> 26:02.813
...that that was the name Dmitri,
spelled in Cyrillic lettering.

26:02.896 --> 26:05.816
How did you make the connection at all?

26:06.483 --> 26:09.987
Somebody shoved this under my door.

26:12.948 --> 26:16.451
I guess you really do
have a friend in the FBI.

26:20.414 --> 26:22.457
And, Mulder...

26:23.000 --> 26:26.503
...when you see Skinner
to hand in your field report...

26:26.587 --> 26:30.007
...I know that it's your decision,
but I hope that you know...

26:30.090 --> 26:35.304
...that I'd consider it more than
a professional loss if you decided to leave.

27:09.713 --> 27:12.466
Everything looks in order.

27:15.636 --> 27:17.930
Is something wrong, Agent Mulder?

27:18.055 --> 27:22.768
That's an unexpected response,
considering the bizarre nature of the case.

27:22.851 --> 27:24.603
And of the suspect.

27:24.686 --> 27:28.357
The strangeness of the criminal
and the crime are not lost on me.

27:28.440 --> 27:34.530
I had my reaction to them in a conversation
about how to process the suspect.

27:34.655 --> 27:37.366
This meeting is to evaluate your work.

27:43.038 --> 27:45.415
There's no way you'll prosecute this.

27:45.541 --> 27:51.004
The Justice Department wants the suspect
transferred to a psychiatric institution.

27:51.088 --> 27:54.758
This is not a man, it's a monster!
You can't put it in an institution.

27:54.883 --> 27:58.011
What do you do with it, Agent Mulder?
Put it in a zoo?

27:58.095 --> 28:00.389
It killed two people.

28:02.432 --> 28:03.892
Two?

28:04.268 --> 28:09.731
The sanitation worker who was attacked was
found dead at home as a result of his injuries.

28:16.029 --> 28:21.368
You know, you had a pair of agents
that could've handled a case like this.

28:21.952 --> 28:26.165
Agent Scully and I might've been able
to save his life, but you shut us down.

28:26.248 --> 28:28.333
I know.

28:29.126 --> 28:31.837
This should have been an <font color="#00FF00">X-File</font>.

28:35.424 --> 28:39.094
We all take our orders
from someone, Agent Mulder.

28:41.013 --> 28:43.223
That'll be all.

29:12.711 --> 29:14.796
You're secure!

29:42.950 --> 29:47.162
This is vehicle 49-40 requesting
immediate backup and assistance.

29:47.246 --> 29:49.373
Roger, 49-40.

33:55.410 --> 33:58.705
- What have you got?
- A dead marshal and an escaped prisoner.

33:58.872 --> 34:00.916
Other than that, bupkis.

34:00.999 --> 34:03.293
We got a police line in a two-mile radius.

34:03.377 --> 34:07.965
Watch any access to the sewer system.
It's gonna try to get back underground.

34:11.009 --> 34:13.846
- Mulder.
- Mr Mulder, I'll make this brief.

34:14.346 --> 34:17.266
Success in your current
assignment is imperative.

34:17.349 --> 34:21.353
- Who am I speaking to?
- Are you hearing me, Mr Mulder?

34:21.687 --> 34:23.813
Yes. Why is it imperative?

34:24.022 --> 34:27.359
Reinstatement of the <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>
must be undeniable.

34:29.610 --> 34:32.822
- Canine unit Six-Four, copy.
- Six-Four, copy.

34:32.906 --> 34:38.203
We're at a campsite a quarter-mile from you.
The dogs tracked a scent to a chemical toilet.

34:38.286 --> 34:41.290
- I looked inside, but it's empty.
- The tanker.

34:41.456 --> 34:45.210
- Hold on, Six-Four.
- What if he's on the tanker truck?

35:03.645 --> 35:08.066
The company that owns the truck
doesn't keep detailed service records.

35:08.150 --> 35:13.363
They had five trucks out this morning.
Three of them have deposited their loads.

35:13.447 --> 35:17.284
- So he could have been here and gone.
- If he hasn't, he will be.

35:17.409 --> 35:20.829
- And every tanker dumps its load here?
- It's a state law.

35:20.913 --> 35:24.333
- Everything's processed through this plant?
- Yep.

35:24.416 --> 35:27.544
- Then what?
- It empties through an outlet pipe...

35:27.628 --> 35:29.755
...about five miles out to sea.

35:29.838 --> 35:33.050
- Could it have escaped through that pipe?
- Doubtful.

35:33.133 --> 35:38.889
The system's full of filters. Nothing bigger
than your little finger's gonna get through.

35:38.972 --> 35:42.976
If it's here, it's going to be trapped here.

35:43.060 --> 35:45.437
I guess all we can do is wait.

36:28.188 --> 36:30.399
- Mulder.
- It's me. Where are you?

36:30.524 --> 36:34.111
The treatment plant. I thought it
might be back in the system.

36:34.236 --> 36:36.947
- How?
- Forget it. It's stupid.

36:37.030 --> 36:40.784
- Well, you won't like what I have to tell you.
- Why not?

36:42.202 --> 36:47.583
It hadn't occurred to me, but the fluke in the
corpse might have been an incubating larva.

36:48.041 --> 36:53.005
This creature, or whatever it is,
transmits its eggs or larvae through its bite.

36:53.589 --> 36:58.302
- You mean it's trying to reproduce?
- It's looking for hosts.

36:58.385 --> 37:03.682
It attacks because the victims' bodies
provide generative nourishment.

37:03.765 --> 37:06.059
- Mulder...
- Yeah.

37:06.226 --> 37:09.646
- If it finds a new host...
- I know. It could multiply.

37:09.771 --> 37:14.735
Agent Mulder! Linesman spotting
something down in a section of pipe!

37:14.860 --> 37:16.862
Where?

37:16.945 --> 37:20.282
- Here.
- That's near where we found the first body.

37:20.365 --> 37:23.368
Right. Except this is
an old overflow system...

37:23.452 --> 37:26.371
...that dumps into the harbour
during heavy rainfall.

37:26.455 --> 37:29.416
That must be where it got into the system.

37:30.167 --> 37:33.128
It's working its way back out to sea.

38:23.762 --> 38:27.933
That's the overflow pipe. It leads
to another vault like this one...

38:28.016 --> 38:31.270
...then about three quarters
of a mile to the sea.

38:31.353 --> 38:34.064
Let's see if we can get that gate closed.

38:54.126 --> 38:56.503
It's rusted in position.

38:56.628 --> 39:00.048
Let's see if I can get some leverage here.

39:18.025 --> 39:19.693
Agh!

39:20.068 --> 39:21.945
Hey!

39:25.365 --> 39:28.494
- Goddammit!
- You all right?

39:28.577 --> 39:30.871
Yeah. I... I lost my glasses.

39:44.718 --> 39:48.555
- Give me your hand!
- Get me outta here!

39:48.931 --> 39:50.724
Grab it!

39:56.438 --> 39:58.982
We need some help down here!

40:21.046 --> 40:22.923
I'll get you outta here!

40:28.428 --> 40:30.514
Hold on! Hold on!

40:31.139 --> 40:33.851
Are you all right? Are you OK?

41:12.222 --> 41:14.600
- Is this seat taken?
- No.

41:14.683 --> 41:17.978
But I should warn you,
I may reek a bit of the sewer.

41:18.061 --> 41:20.355
I'll take my chances.

41:27.905 --> 41:30.991
You talked to Skinner yesterday?

41:31.074 --> 41:33.619
Success in our work is imperative, Scully.

41:33.744 --> 41:37.664
Reinstatement of the <font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font>
must be undeniable.

41:37.748 --> 41:41.084
- That came from Skinner?!
- No.

41:41.543 --> 41:44.338
We have a friend in the FBI.

41:46.590 --> 41:52.262
I thought you might be interested in the lab
results on the biology of the fluke larva.

41:53.180 --> 41:56.600
Dissection and analysis indicates...

41:56.683 --> 42:00.187
...reproductive and physiological
cross-traiting...

42:00.312 --> 42:03.565
...resulting in a sort of
quasi-vertebrate human.

42:04.066 --> 42:05.317
Human?

42:05.400 --> 42:11.365
Yes, but still capable of spontaneous
regeneration, like any fluke or flatworm.

42:12.157 --> 42:14.117
How does that happen?

42:14.201 --> 42:16.954
Radiation. Abnormal cell fusion.

42:17.037 --> 42:20.165
The suppression of natural
genetic processes.

42:21.333 --> 42:24.837
Mulder, nature didn't make this thing. We did.

42:43.647 --> 42:45.440
I know these.

42:48.318 --> 42:51.196
These are from Chernobyl.

42:51.280 --> 42:55.284
That creature came off of a
decommissioned Russian freighter...

42:55.367 --> 42:59.788
...that was used in the disposal of
salvage material from the meltdown.

42:59.913 --> 43:04.543
It was born in a... in a primordial
soup of radioactive sewage.

43:09.590 --> 43:13.886
You know, they say three species
disappear off the planet every day.

43:13.969 --> 43:17.181
You wonder how many new ones
are being created.
