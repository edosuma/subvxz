IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.403 --> 00:06.774
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.807 --> 00:09.277
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:09.310 --> 00:10.744
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.778 --> 00:12.480
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:12.513 --> 00:14.448
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:14.482 --> 00:17.551
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.187
- OH, MY GOD!

00:19.220 --> 00:21.255
I FEEL AMAZING!

00:21.289 --> 00:22.523
LET'S DO MORE.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.292
- WE DID ALL OF IT.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.626
OHH.

00:25.659 --> 00:28.796
- THEN DANCE FOR ME!
DO YOUR CABBAGE PATCH.

00:30.398 --> 00:33.767
OHH!
[laughs]

00:33.801 --> 00:35.069
- DON'T MAKE FUN OF ME.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.137
- [laughs]

00:36.170 --> 00:38.606
[baby talk] IS THE "WITTLE" BOY
GETTING "ANGWRY"?

00:38.639 --> 00:40.674
- STOP IT.
I MEAN IT.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.778
- IS THE "WITTLE" BOY
GONNA TEACH ME A LESSON?

00:44.812 --> 00:47.248
[both laughing]

00:47.281 --> 00:48.716
UNH!
- WHOO!

00:48.749 --> 00:51.119
YOU GOT TO RUN FASTER.
YOU GOT TO RUN FASTER THAN THAT!

00:51.152 --> 00:52.753
[both laughing]

00:55.556 --> 00:57.291
- IS "WITTLE" JIMMY
GETTING TIRED "ALWEADY"?

00:57.325 --> 00:59.627
- AVA, SHUT UP.

00:59.660 --> 01:03.131
- [scoffs]

01:07.401 --> 01:09.803
- PETECHIAE--
IT MEANS SHE DROWNED.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.339
THAT'S HARD TO DO
IN A FOOT OF WATER.

01:11.372 --> 01:12.873
- NOT IF SOMEBODY KNOCKS YOU OUT
OR HOLDS YOU UNDER.

01:12.906 --> 01:13.874
YOU GET A TIME OF DEATH?

01:13.907 --> 01:16.244
- YEAH, CORNEAL CLOUDING
PUTS IT AROUND 4:00 A.M.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.179
- SO I'M GUESSING
THAT THE FOUNTAIN WASHED AWAY

01:18.212 --> 01:19.380
ANY EVIDENCE?

01:19.413 --> 01:20.414
- YEAH, ON THE OUTSIDE,

01:20.448 --> 01:23.651
BUT I GOT BLOOD AND SEMEN
IN HER HOOCHIE-HOO.

01:23.684 --> 01:24.852
UH, I'M SORRY.

01:24.885 --> 01:28.189
I SOMETIMES FORGET
THAT THEY'RE PEOPLE.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.158
- YOU GET ANYTHING
FROM SKINNY AND DIPPER?

01:30.191 --> 01:32.726
- YEAH, HE CAN'T STOP
STARING AT HER ASS,

01:32.760 --> 01:34.762
AND SHE CAN'T WAIT
TO NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.598
- OKAY, PATROL STILL CAN'T FIND
HER CLOTHES OR HER PURSE.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.533
- DETECTIVES?

01:39.567 --> 01:41.835
THIS IS NOT
A FASHION STATEMENT.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.743
- [sighs] SO OUR PERP
CUT OFF A HUNK OF HER HAIR

01:49.777 --> 01:50.644
AS A KEEPSAKE.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.147
- SO HE CAN RELIEVE
EVERY SICK MOMENT.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.749
- TILL HE FINDS
HIS NEXT VICTIM.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.699
- CAPTAIN SAY
HOW LONG WE'D BE HERE?

02:45.733 --> 02:47.235
- NAH.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.936
HE'S AT THE OLD PRECINCT,
TRYING TO CLEAN IT UP.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.838
- [chuckles]
YOU HOPE THEY CONDEMN IT.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.573
- HELL, YEAH,
AFTER A FLOOD LIKE THAT.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.674
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW
WHERE THAT WATER'S BEEN.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.709
- NOT TO MENTION THIS PLACE
IS CLOSER TO YOUR HOUSE.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.245
- YEAH?
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT?

02:57.278 --> 03:00.248
- MORE SPACE, BETTER LIGHT--
NOT TOO SHABBY.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.549
- DID A DATABASE SEARCH

03:01.582 --> 03:03.417
ON YOUR HAIR-CUTTING M.O.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.519
- ANYTHING ON THE, UH,
CENTRAL PARK BARBER?

03:05.553 --> 03:07.755
- PATROL COLLARED THIS CREEP.
HE HANGS OUT IN THE PARK.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.258
SNUCK UP ON A WOMAN
AND CUT HER HAIR.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.592
LOCALS CALL HIM "SASSOON."

03:11.625 --> 03:13.727
- I COULD USE A TRIM.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.997
I KNOW.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.866
BUT AT LEAST
I GOT MY HAIR DONE.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.535
YEAH, IT LOOKS AMAZING.
I WENT TO THIS NEW PLACE.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.771
AND IT'S SO SHINY AND SILKY.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.006
I LOOK LIKE
A MILLION DOLLARS.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.875
YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.544
I KNOW.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.646
I KNOW, MA, BUT MEN
DON'T GROW ON TREES.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.248
- HEY!
NICE TRY, SASSOON.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.849
- OW!
THAT'S NOT MY NAME!

03:35.883 --> 03:37.618
- REALLY?
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.387
YOU'RE FAMOUS AROUND HERE.
- REALLY?

03:39.420 --> 03:41.622
WOW.

03:41.655 --> 03:42.623
- OH.
[handcuffs clicking]

03:42.656 --> 03:45.593
- WE WANT TO HEAR
ALL ABOUT YOUR LATEST CUT.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.760
- THAT GIRL IN THE FOUNTAIN

03:46.794 --> 03:48.296
WAS ALREADY DEAD
WHEN I CUT HER HAIR.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.630
- YEAH, BUT NOT
WHEN YOU RAPED HER.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.931
YOU'RE GOING DOWN
FOR THAT AND MURDER.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.566
- NO, NO.
I GOT A LULLABY.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.335
- YOU WANT TO SING US
A FEW BARS?

03:54.368 --> 03:56.937
- I WAS AT BANANA-TRAMA
ALL NIGHT.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.307
- THAT'S AN ALIBI,
NOT A LULLABY, YOU MORON.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.809
- BANANA-TRAMA'S THAT
TRANSVESTITE CLUB ON COLUMBUS.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.545
- I GOT A LAP DANCE
FROM MISS TERRY.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.680
- I'LL LET YOU CHECK
HIS "LULLABY"

04:06.714 --> 04:08.349
FROM BANANA-TRAMA.

04:08.382 --> 04:11.552
- IT IS WHAT I LIVE FOR.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.787
- YOU GONNA USE YOUR DESK?

04:13.821 --> 04:15.623
- WELL, YOU GO
TO THE SAME PLACE FOR YEARS...

04:15.656 --> 04:16.957
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.959
ACTUALLY, I DROVE TO
THE OLD PRECINCT THIS MORNING.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.561
- ANY HITS
ON OUR JANE DOE'S PRINTS?

04:20.594 --> 04:21.862
- NOPE.
[electricity shorts out]

04:21.895 --> 04:23.964
AND IT DOESN'T HELP
THAT THAT KEEPS HAPPENING.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.534
- [sighs] SORRY.
I'LL GET IT FIXED IN A MINUTE.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.935
- THE MEDIA ROOM'S
UP AND RUNNING.

04:27.968 --> 04:28.936
- [sighs]

04:28.969 --> 04:31.372
OH, COME ON.
WHO PUT THAT HERE?

04:31.405 --> 04:32.606
COME ON, WHO?

04:32.640 --> 04:35.609
ALL GOES TO HELL
WHEN CRAGEN'S GONE, HUH?

04:35.643 --> 04:37.678
- BAD NEWS.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.514
NIGHT MANAGER OF BANANA-TRAMA
CONFIRMS SASSOON'S "LULLABY."

04:40.548 --> 04:41.582
HE'S A REGULAR.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.651
HE WAS BOOTED OUT OF THERE
FOR GIVING MISS TERRY

04:43.684 --> 04:45.018
AN UNWANTED BOB.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.321
- WHAT TIME?
- 4:30.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.357
AFTER OUR JANE DOE WAS DROWNED.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.360
- SO WE'RE BACK TO NOTHING.
- SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.994
MIKKA VON, YOUR NEW A.D.A.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.630
- HEY.
STABLER, BENSON.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.031
- I DON'T GET FIRST NAMES?

04:58.065 --> 04:59.700
- WELL, WE GO THROUGH
A.D.A.s PRETTY FAST AROUND HERE.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.634
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

05:00.668 --> 05:03.404
- DNA FROM THE SEMEN
INSIDE YOUR VICTIM.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.005
- YOU WORK FAST.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.874
- WELL, IT SAYS HERE
THAT IT BELONGS TO A WOMAN--

05:06.907 --> 05:08.609
MONICA WORLEY...

05:08.642 --> 05:11.111
COLLARED FOR ASSAULTING A COP

05:11.144 --> 05:13.447
AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL
CONVENTION IN '04.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.483
- YEAH, I GOT
AN SVU FUN FACT FOR YOU.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.717
SEMEN ONLY COMES FROM GUYS.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.586
- THERE WERE NO HITS
ON THE SAMPLE.

05:18.619 --> 05:21.021
SO I ASKED THE LAB
TO RUN A PARTIAL MATCH.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.756
- WHICH POINTS TO MONICA'S
BROTHER AS OUR PERP.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.625
- WELL, YOU GUYS GOT IT EASY.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.428
FAMILIAL DNA'S NOT LEGAL YET
IN ILLINOIS.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.830
- IS THAT WHERE YOU'RE FROM?
- CHICAGO, BUT...

05:29.863 --> 05:31.932
I'M READY TO TRADE MY BEARS
FOR THE GIANTS.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.000
- JETS.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.735
- OH, GOTCHA.

05:34.768 --> 05:35.869
BY THE WAY,
IF YOU KNOW ANYONE

05:35.903 --> 05:38.606
WHO WANTS TO BUY A SUN-DRENCHED
LOFT ON LAKE MICHIGAN,

05:38.639 --> 05:40.708
THE SELLER'S MOTIVATED.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.009
OH!
GIVE ME A JINGLE

05:42.042 --> 05:44.745
AFTER YOU CHAT
WITH YOUR RAPIST'S SISTER.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.582
- WE SURE THAT'S HER?

05:48.616 --> 05:50.117
- YEAH, THE GALLERY OWNER
CONFIRMED IT.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.120
AND...
THAT APPARENTLY IS ART.

05:53.153 --> 05:56.089
- MONICA WORLEY!

05:56.123 --> 05:57.891
HEY, WE NEED TO TALK.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.628
- MONICA.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.630
AH, YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS?
LET'S GO. HERE YOU GO.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.532
- KEEP YOUR DAY JOB,
DETECTIVE,

06:04.565 --> 06:05.599
'CAUSE YOU SUCK AT MINE.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.469
- I SUCK? YOU SUCK
AT COOPERATING WITH THE POLICE.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.470
- HOW YOU GONNA
HARASS ME THIS TIME?

06:09.503 --> 06:11.905
- IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.
IT'S ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.441
- WHAT'D HE DO NOW?

06:13.474 --> 06:16.544
- HE HAD SOME PROBLEMS
WITH A YOUNG LADY.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.645
- DID HE HURT HER?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.580
- YOU COULD SAY THAT.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.649
- I KNEW ONE DAY
HE'D GO TOO FAR.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.451
HE ALWAYS THOUGHT
HIS TRUST FUND

06:23.484 --> 06:25.519
ENTITLED HIM TO PAW
ANY WOMAN HE WANTED.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.755
- WHERE CAN WE FIND HIM?

06:27.788 --> 06:31.625
- OWNS A BROWNSTONE
ON 75TH AND 5TH.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.661
- THIS WOULDN'T BE SO BAD
IF IT WAS ME AND THAT LADY COP,

06:33.694 --> 06:34.728
INSTEAD OF YOU.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.063
- YOU WANT TO DO
TO MY PARTNER

06:36.096 --> 06:37.631
WHAT YOU DID
TO THAT BLOND GIRL LAST NIGHT?

06:37.665 --> 06:39.733
- [chuckles]
MY REPUTATION PRECEDES ME.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.469
- YEAH.
- WHAT'D SHE SAY?

06:41.502 --> 06:44.638
- AH, SHE'S NOT DOING
TOO MUCH TALKING.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.541
YEAH, BEING RAPED AND MURDERED
WILL DO THAT TO YOU.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.176
- OKAY, ME AND BLONDIE
HAD SEX,

06:49.209 --> 06:50.978
BUT I SURE AS HELL
DIDN'T RAPE AND KILL HER.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.846
- BLONDIE?
WHAT'S HER REAL NAME?

06:52.880 --> 06:53.781
- SHE NEVER SAID.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.649
SHE JUST CAME UP TO ME
NEAR THE RESERVOIR

06:55.683 --> 06:57.150
AND SAID
SHE WAS HOT AND WET.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.151
- [clears throat]

06:58.185 --> 06:59.687
A STRANGER IN THE PARK

06:59.720 --> 07:02.055
THROWS HERSELF AT YOU
BECAUSE WHY--

07:02.089 --> 07:03.591
YOU'RE SO CHARISMATIC?

07:03.624 --> 07:05.225
- LOOK, THE SEX
WAS CONSENSUAL, OKAY?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.461
SHE EVEN TOOK OUT A TAMPON
BEFORE WE DID IT.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.662
- OKAY.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.163
WHERE'S THE TAMPON?

07:10.197 --> 07:11.999
- KILLER ATE IT...

07:12.032 --> 07:14.067
MY DACHSHUND.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.803
I HAD TO TAKE HIM
TO THE VET.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.138
- YOUR DOG
ATE YOUR HOMEWORK?

07:18.171 --> 07:20.007
YOU JUST GOT AN "F"
FOR YOUR ALIBI.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.575
- WAIT.
WAI--WAI--WAIT.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.076
I TOOK VIDEO, OKAY?

07:23.110 --> 07:25.178
I HAVE A FOLLOWING.
- A FOLLOWING?

07:25.212 --> 07:27.648
- YEAH, ON SEXPROWL.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.217
IT'S THE YOUTUBE OF SEX.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.720
- I'M HOT.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.055
SO...WET.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.626
I WANT IT...

07:38.659 --> 07:39.760
NOW.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.194
- WAS I LYING?
WAIT, HERE'S ME.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.195
- KID YOU NOT, WHIT-FANS.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.697
I'M OUT WALKING
MY DOG, KILLER,

07:43.731 --> 07:45.232
AND HOTTIE HERE
JUST WALKS UP TO ME.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.667
WHAT'S A GUY TO DO?

07:46.700 --> 07:48.769
- I WANT IT.
HURRY UP!

07:48.802 --> 07:50.538
I WANT IT...

07:50.571 --> 07:52.540
NOW!

07:52.573 --> 07:53.941
- I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.577
WE'LL NEVER GET RAPE
OFF THIS VIDEO.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.146
- FINALLY,
SOMEONE TALKING SENSE.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.749
- STILL HAVE MURDER.
- NOT ANYMORE.

08:01.782 --> 08:02.983
EMERGENCY VET
SAID THIS JERK

08:03.016 --> 08:04.217
WAS THERE TILL 6:00 A.M.,

08:04.251 --> 08:06.920
WHEN KILLER FINALLY
COUGHED UP THE KOTEX.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.757
- I TOLD YOU. I DIDN'T RAPE
OR KILL THIS BROAD.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.158
NOW, CAN I GET OUT OF HERE?

08:11.191 --> 08:12.893
- NOT FAST ENOUGH.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.529
- I WOULD HAVE ENJOYED
THROWING HIS SORRY ASS IN JAIL.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.997
MIKKA VON, YOUR NEW A.D.A.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.832
- ODAFIN TUTUOLA.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.001
- OH, A FIRST NAME--
I'M MAKING PROGRESS.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.170
ODAFIN, SHE DROPPED HER PURSE
IN SOME BUSHES

08:23.203 --> 08:24.271
NEAR THE RESERVOIR.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.773
- NO PROBLEM.
I'M ON IT.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.776
- I'M GONNA ERASE THIS CRAP
FROM OUR SCREENS.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.979
- TRY THE "Q."
- I TRIED THAT.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.915
- WET PAINT
PLUS NO CLEAN CLOTHES

08:34.948 --> 08:36.984
EQUALS UNIFORMS--
SIMPLE MATH.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.919
IF ONLY THE COMPUTERS
WERE THAT SIMPLE, HUH?

08:38.952 --> 08:41.054
- EXCUSE ME.
MISSING PERSONS SENT ME HERE.

08:41.088 --> 08:43.624
IS THIS YOUR CASE?

08:43.657 --> 08:44.758
- IT IS.
AND YOU ARE...?

08:44.792 --> 08:46.093
- YOU SON OF A BITCH.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.928
- OHH!
- TAKE IT EASY!

08:47.961 --> 08:49.663
- HEY, CUT IT OUT!

08:49.697 --> 08:51.331
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT US!
- RELAX.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.066
- SOMEBODY EMAILED
THAT GARBAGE TO ME.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.002
WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP IT?
- WHO ARE YOU?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.738
- [wheezing]
I'M GREG ELDING.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.073
THAT WOMAN IS MY WIFE.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.650
- YES, THAT'S...

09:09.683 --> 09:11.184
LINDSAY.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.186
- DO YOU REMEMBER
WHERE YOUR WIFE WAS YESTERDAY,

09:13.220 --> 09:15.889
MR. ELDING?

09:15.923 --> 09:18.091
- AT THE OFFICE, I GUESS.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.928
LINDSAY IS HEAD OF P.R.
FOR COLANOW,

09:20.961 --> 09:22.129
THE SODA COMPANY.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.031
- THAT'S A PRETTY
HIGH-PRESSURE JOB.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.033
ANY CHANCE
SHE WAS USING DRUGS?

09:26.066 --> 09:29.302
- SHE DID
UNTIL A YEAR AGO.

09:29.336 --> 09:32.039
LINDSAY'S
A RECOVERING ADDICT--

09:32.072 --> 09:33.774
COCAINE.

09:33.807 --> 09:37.711
IT FUELED HER CAREER,
BUT IT--IT NEARLY TORE US APART.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.212
NOW FAMILY TIME'S SACRED.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.148
SHE'D NEVER GO BACK.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.015
- ARE YOU SURE?

09:42.049 --> 09:44.652
SHE LOOKED PRETTY HIGH
IN THAT VIDEO.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.054
- MY WIFE IS THE VICTIM HERE.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.156
I DON'T KNOW
WHY SHE WAS ACTING THAT WAY.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.058
THIS...

09:51.091 --> 09:55.629
THIS IS THE LINDSAY
THAT I KNOW.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.330
- DO YOU THINK
THE KIDS WILL LIKE IT?

09:57.364 --> 09:59.733
- YEAH, IT'S AWESOME!

09:59.767 --> 10:01.735
MOM, WAVE TO DAD.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.070
- HI.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.072
- HI.
- WE LOVE YOU.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.207
- WHAT KIDS WOULD LIKE IT?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.942
- NEEDY ONES.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.111
COLANOW DONATES
JUNGLE GYMS TO CHARITY.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.013
- OKAY...

10:13.046 --> 10:14.414
SECURITY AT YOUR BUILDING

10:14.447 --> 10:17.117
CONFIRMS YOU WERE HOME
ALL NIGHT.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.419
- I'M SORRY
I GOT ROUGH WITH YOU.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.388
I JUST...

10:21.421 --> 10:24.692
KIND OF LOST MY MIND
WHEN I SAW THAT VIDEO.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.093
- ANY IDEA WHO SENT IT?

10:26.126 --> 10:27.795
- NO.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.097
BUT DOING P.R.
FOR A COMPANY LIKE COLANOW

10:30.130 --> 10:31.999
MADE LINDSAY
A LOT OF ENEMIES.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.339
- ENEMIES?
HELL, YEAH.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.309
SODA USED TO MEAN FUN,
GOOD TIMES, AMERICA.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.011
- BUT NOW IT MEANS
300-POUND KIDS

10:44.044 --> 10:46.079
GETTING WINDED
WALKING UP THE SCHOOL STEPS.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.781
- YEAH, PEOPLE SAY WE'RE
AS BAD AS CIGARETTE COMPANIES.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.951
YOU DON'T SEE ME OUT THERE
FORCING SODA DOWN KIDS' THROATS.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.753
- BIG TOBACCO
SAID THE SAME THING.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.387
DIDN'T WORK OUT
TOO WELL IN COURT, DID IT?

10:54.421 --> 10:57.090
- WELL, LINDSAY ELDING
IS WHY WE'RE NOT IN COURT.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.225
SHE WAS SEXY, SMART.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.927
[cell phone ringing]
SHE EVEN CHARMED
THE NEANDERTHALS

10:59.960 --> 11:00.928
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.295
SHE WAS THAT GOOD.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.831
- GOOD?
THAT'S A LAUGH.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.232
LINDSAY ELDING
AND ALL THE SODA COMPANIES

11:05.265 --> 11:07.067
KNOW THEIR PRODUCTS
ARE POISON.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.102
- IS THAT WHY YOU REFUSED
THE HUNDRED GRAND

11:09.136 --> 11:10.403
THEY OFFERED
YOUR ORGANIZATION?

11:10.437 --> 11:12.840
- THAT WAS A BRIBE
TO SILENCE US.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.407
WE WERE ABOUT TO PASS
A TAX ON SODA

11:14.441 --> 11:16.977
WHEN THAT GET-OF-THE-COUCH
CAMPAIGN KILLED IT.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.046
THAT WAS LINDSAY ELDING'S
BRAINCHILD.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.081
- WELL, PEOPLE
SHOULD EXERCISE MORE.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.250
- OF COURSE,
BUT SHE DISTRACTED EVERYONE

11:23.283 --> 11:26.787
FROM THE SIMPLE FACT
THAT SODA'S BAD FOR KIDS.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.021
ASK DAVEY GAMM'S MOTHER.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.991
SHE'LL TELL YOU
WHAT SODA DID TO HIM.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.427
- DAVEY WAS 12
WHEN HE TOOK HIS LIFE.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.264
I TRIED TO MAKE HIM STOP
WITH THE COLA.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.933
BUT HE WAS ADDICTED TO IT.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.869
- SODA MADE HIM KILL HIMSELF?

11:41.902 --> 11:44.938
- I COLLECTED
ALL THE RESEARCH.

11:44.972 --> 11:48.241
HIGH-FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP
CAN MAKE YOU OBESE,

11:48.275 --> 11:51.111
AND OBESITY
CAN MAKE YOU DEPRESSED.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.280
- AND DEPRESSION
CAN LEAD TO SUICIDE.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.448
I--I'M JUST NOT SURE

11:55.482 --> 11:58.385
THAT YOU CAN BLAME SODA
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR SON.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.888
- THAT'S WHAT THE JURY SAID.

12:00.921 --> 12:04.124
BUT WE WOULD HAVE WON OUR SUIT
IF THAT WOMAN HADN'T BUILT

12:04.157 --> 12:06.994
THE COLANOW ATHLETIC CENTER
FOR THE COMMUNITY.

12:07.027 --> 12:07.928
- AND THAT WOMAN WAS...?

12:07.961 --> 12:10.964
- LINDSAY ELDING--
SHE PAID FOR THE CENTER.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.900
- SO IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU
IF THIS PLACE WAS BUILT

12:12.933 --> 12:16.103
AS A P.R. STUNT
TO WIN A WRONGFUL-DEATH SUIT.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.338
- I'M A JUST A COACH GETTING
POOR KIDS OFF THE STREET.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.073
THAT WOMAN'S A HERO.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.242
- HERO TO SOME,
HATED BY OTHERS.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.443
- IT'S CALLED DOING YOUR JOB.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.378
- WELL, I'M PISSED
THE SODA TAX FAILED.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.047
LINDSAY WAS BEHIND THAT.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.415
- WHO NEEDS MORE TAXES?

12:28.448 --> 12:29.950
- TAXES ALREADY GO TO SODA--

12:29.983 --> 12:32.252
A $4 BILLION-A-YEAR SUBSIDY
FOR CORN SYRUP.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.121
THAT'S WHY SODA'S SO CHEAP.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.255
- A TAX ON SUGAR WATER

12:35.288 --> 12:37.157
WOULD HELP PAY
FOR THE COST OF DIABETES

12:37.190 --> 12:38.225
AND HEART DISEASE.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.161
- SUGAR WATER ISN'T
THE ONLY CAUSE FOR OBESITY.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.897
AT LEAST LINDSAY WAS HELPING
THE LITTLE GUY.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.899
- THE LITTLE GUY,
BROUGHT TO YOU BY COLANOW--

12:45.933 --> 12:47.134
AH, REFRESHING.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.435
- COME ON, MONEY
PUT TO GOOD USE IS GOOD.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.470
- IF COLANOW REALLY CARED
ABOUT POOR KIDS,

12:50.503 --> 12:53.206
THEY WOULDN'T GO PLASTERING
THEIR LOGO ALL OVER THE PLACE.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.842
- WELL, MAYBE LINDSAY
KNEW DEEP DOWN

12:54.875 --> 12:56.109
THAT SHE WAS DOING
THE DEVIL'S WORK,

12:56.143 --> 12:57.577
SO SHE WENT
BACK TO USING DRUGS.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.446
- YEAH, EXCEPT HER TOX SCREEN
CAME BACK NEGATIVE.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.081
- BUT IT ONLY TESTS
POPULAR DRUGS--

13:01.114 --> 13:03.150
COCAINE, METH, "X."

13:03.183 --> 13:05.085
PCP ISN'T
ON THE STANDARD SCREEN ANYMORE.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.920
SO, YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE ARE JUMPING OFF BRIDGES,

13:06.954 --> 13:08.155
THINKING THEY CAN FLY.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.590
- OKAY, SO MAYBE SHE THOUGHT
SHE COULD BREATHE UNDERWATER.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.826
WE PROVE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
CASE CLOSED.

13:12.860 --> 13:13.927
WE GO HOME.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.062
- BUT IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

13:15.095 --> 13:18.231
LINDSAY ELDING WAS POISONED.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.302
- BY WHO--THE SMURFS?

13:22.335 --> 13:25.472
- WARNER FOUND MUSHROOMS
IN LINDSAY'S GUT, RAN THE DNA,

13:25.505 --> 13:27.841
AND I.D.'D FOUR SPECIES
FROM SOUTH AMERICA.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.010
- THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU GET
FROM YOUR LOCAL GROCER.

13:30.043 --> 13:30.878
- I HOPE NOT.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.413
THESE CONTAIN HIGH DOSES
OF MUSCARINE--

13:33.446 --> 13:35.448
A TOXIN WHICH MAKES YOU
HOT, SWEATY,

13:35.482 --> 13:37.017
AND SEXUALLY AROUSED.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.086
- "I'M HOT.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.587
I'M WET."

13:40.620 --> 13:42.956
EXPLAINS WHY LINDSAY
TOOK HER CLOTHES OFF.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.059
- AND WHY SHE THREW HERSELF
AT A JERK LIKE WHIT WORLEY.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.095
- AND WHY SHE TRIED TO COOL
HERSELF OFF IN THE FOUNTAIN,

13:48.128 --> 13:50.097
BUT WHY DID SHE DROWN?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.465
- MUSCARINE TOXICITY CAN LEAD
TO RESPIRATORY FAILURE.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.434
LINDSAY TOOK HER LAST
WEAK BREATHS UNDERWATER,

13:54.467 --> 13:55.869
BUT SHE
WOULD HAVE DIED ANYWAY.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.070
- SO ONE OF LINDSAY'S ENEMIES

13:57.104 --> 14:00.207
SLIPPED HER A DEADLY COCKTAIL
OF 'SHROOMS.

14:00.240 --> 14:00.874
BUT WHEN?

14:00.908 --> 14:03.143
- THEY WERE IN HER JEJUNUM.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.045
DIAL BACK
THE DIGESTIVE CLOCK,

14:05.078 --> 14:07.080
AND THAT PUTS YOU
RIGHT AROUND DINNERTIME.

14:07.114 --> 14:10.183
- OKAY, HER CALENDAR
SAYS SHE WAS AT A FUNDRAISER

14:10.217 --> 14:12.085
AT A PLACE
CALLED "WISHING TIME."

14:12.119 --> 14:14.421
THEY WERE GIVING OUT
FREE JUNGLE GYMS.

14:17.290 --> 14:21.128
- MY GRANDFATHER DONATED
THE FIRST TEETER-TOTTER

14:21.161 --> 14:24.197
TO CENTRAL PARK IN 1907.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.499
- MUST BE VERY GRATIFYING
TO CONTINUE HIS WORK.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.667
- OH, INDEED.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.970
CHILDREN
IN UNDERPRIVILEGED COMMUNITIES

14:30.003 --> 14:32.472
CAN MAKE A WISH,
AND WE GRANT IT.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.575
WE BUILD
ANTIGANG CLUBHOUSES...

14:35.608 --> 14:37.077
- COLANOW ATHLETIC CENTER?

14:37.110 --> 14:39.446
- WE COLLABORATED IN THAT.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.115
LINDSAY--
OH, SUCH A TRAGEDY.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.550
WHAT AN AMAZING WOMAN.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.453
SHE HAD A GENIUS
FOR CORPORATE GIVING.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.554
- AND IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU

14:47.587 --> 14:50.490
THAT THE MONEY CAME
FROM A COMPANY THAT PUSHES SODA?

14:50.523 --> 14:52.159
- [laughing]
OH, NO, NOT A BIT.

14:52.192 --> 14:55.162
THE BROOKS FAMILY FORTUNE
IS IN PHILANTHROPY NOW--

14:55.195 --> 14:56.964
- EXCUSE ME.
- HMM?

14:56.997 --> 15:00.100
- THAT'S LINDSAY WITH MUSHROOMS
ON HER SALAD.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.236
- OH, THERE WERE
NO MUSHROOMS ON THE MENU.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.638
EMMA?

15:05.672 --> 15:08.175
EMMA IS MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

15:08.208 --> 15:12.145
LINDSAY'S DEATH WAS
A TERRIBLE BLOW TO HER.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.646
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.116
NOW, PULL OUT THE PHOTOS
FROM MONDAY NIGHT

15:16.149 --> 15:17.517
FOR THE DETECTIVES.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.386
- SURE.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.257
THERE YOU GO.

15:24.291 --> 15:28.161
- SO LINDSAY WAS YOUR FRIEND?
- MORE LIKE MY BIG SISTER.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.596
WE MET IN REHAB.

15:29.629 --> 15:33.233
- NO NEED TO AIR
OUR DIRTY LAUNDRY, EMMA.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.103
EMMA'S PARENTS DIED
WHEN SHE WAS TEN.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.971
I'VE DONE MY BEST SINCE,

15:38.005 --> 15:41.741
BUT LINDSAY WAS A BREATH
OF FRESH AIR FOR HER.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.445
- THESE ARE
DEFINITELY MUSHROOMS...

15:45.478 --> 15:47.347
ON LINDSAY'S PLATE
AND NO ONE ELSE'S.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.649
- SO WHO PUT 'EM THERE?

15:49.682 --> 15:51.718
- OH, WE HAD OVER 300 GUESTS.

15:51.751 --> 15:52.719
- WHO TOOK THESE?

15:52.752 --> 15:55.355
- I DID, BUT, UH,
WE ALSO HAD PHOTOGRAPHERS

15:55.388 --> 15:56.556
TAKING PHOTOS.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.225
- WE'RE GONNA NEED COPIES
OF ALL OF THEM.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.227
- OKAY, WHO IS THIS GUY?

16:00.260 --> 16:02.395
DOESN'T SEEM TOO HAPPY--
THIS GENTLEMAN RIGHT HERE.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.232
- HE WAS JUST A HOMELESS GUY.
HE CAME IN LOOKING FOR FOOD.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.200
- NO!

16:07.234 --> 16:09.202
NO, HE ACCOSTED LINDSAY,

16:09.236 --> 16:10.303
YELLED AT HER.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.105
- ABOUT WHAT?

16:12.139 --> 16:14.074
- BOLIVIA, ODDLY ENOUGH.

16:14.107 --> 16:17.610
HE KEPT RANTING,
"YOU CAN'T OWN THE RAIN."

16:17.644 --> 16:20.080
[chuckling]
IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.048
- IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.316
BOLIVIA'S GROUND ZERO
FOR THE WATER WARS--

16:23.350 --> 16:25.618
CORPORATIONS OWNING
OUR H2O.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.819
- WHAT'S THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH OUR VICTIM?

16:26.853 --> 16:29.156
- IN THIS COUNTRY, COMPANIES
ARE TRYING TO BUY UP RIVERS

16:29.189 --> 16:30.223
SO THEY CAN BOTTLE IT.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.692
- COMPANIES LIKE COLANOW
PUT FREE WATER IN PLASTIC,

16:32.725 --> 16:34.427
AND THEN THEY CHARGE
TWO BUCKS FOR IT.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.096
- COLANOW WANTS
TO OWN THE RAIN.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.397
THIS IS A WATER-RIGHTS BLOG.

16:37.430 --> 16:40.167
HERE'S A POST RAILING
AGAINST COLANOW'S ATTEMPTS

16:40.200 --> 16:41.634
TO BUY
THE UPSTATE AQUIFERS.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.236
- AND LOOK
WHO OUR BLOGGER IS--

16:43.270 --> 16:45.205
THE GUY THAT WAS KICKED OUT
OF WISHING TIME.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.207
- "VINCENT PROCHIK,
PROFESSOR OF MYCOLOGY,

16:47.240 --> 16:48.275
NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM."

16:48.308 --> 16:51.711
- "SPECIALIZING IN TOXIC
SOUTH AMERICAN MUSHROOMS."

16:54.147 --> 16:55.815
- DR. PROCHIK!

16:55.848 --> 16:59.152
DR. PROCHIK, SHOW YOURSELF!

17:02.655 --> 17:06.559
- PROFESSOR PROCHIK, POLICE.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.629
TURN AROUND, DOC.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.131
- WHA--WHO ARE YOU?

17:11.164 --> 17:13.100
- POLICE.
- DON'T--

17:13.133 --> 17:15.502
- WHAT YA COOKING HERE?

17:15.535 --> 17:18.471
- [clears throat]

17:18.505 --> 17:21.141
MUSHROOMS.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.075
IS THAT ILLEGAL?

17:22.109 --> 17:24.377
- IT IS IF YOU USE IT
TO POISON SOMEONE.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.614
- LINDSAY ELDING
WANTED TO PRIVATIZE WATER.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.849
IT'S A RESOURCE
THAT BELONGS TO EVERYONE.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.452
- IT DOESN'T JUSTIFY MURDER.
- OH, I AGREE.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.455
I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT, YAY! SHE'S DEAD!

17:35.488 --> 17:37.624
- SHE HAD A DAUGHTER,
DR. PROCHIK,

17:37.657 --> 17:40.127
WHO'S NOW GONNA GROW UP
WITHOUT A DAD.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.130
- YOU MEAN A MOM?

17:43.163 --> 17:44.564
- A MOTHER...

17:44.597 --> 17:46.399
THAT YOU DOSED
WITH SEVERAL KINDS

17:46.433 --> 17:49.869
OF SOUTH AMERICAN MUSHROOMS,
YOUR SPECIALTY.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.206
WE HAVE A PHOTO
THAT PUTS YOU AT THE SCENE.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.242
- AT NIAGARA FALLS...

17:57.410 --> 17:59.246
RING A BELL?

17:59.279 --> 18:00.847
- DETECTIVE, YOU OKAY?

18:00.880 --> 18:03.216
- WE SAW YOU ON THE ROOF
WITH YOUR GUNMAN.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.417
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:04.451 --> 18:06.853
- I'M NOT THE ONE WHO STABBED
THE CAPTAIN WITH A PICKLE!

18:06.886 --> 18:08.521
- UH-OH.
LET ME LOOK AT YOU.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.657
I NEED TO SEE YOUR EYES.
- YOU. BACK OFF. OVER THERE.

18:10.690 --> 18:11.891
- QUICK, CATCH HER.
SHE'S GONNA FALL.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.860
- STAY THERE.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.295
LIV. LIV!

18:15.328 --> 18:17.197
GET A BUS!

18:17.230 --> 18:20.133
WE NEED A BUS!
OFFICER DOWN!

18:26.639 --> 18:27.740
- HEY, LIV.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.512
HOW YOU FEELING?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.884
- WHO PUT ROCKS IN MY HEAD?

18:37.917 --> 18:39.786
- VINCENT PROCHIK.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.654
HE WAS BOILING
GYROMITRA MUSHROOMS

18:41.688 --> 18:44.224
WHEN YOU ARRESTED HIM
IN HIS LAB,

18:44.257 --> 18:48.828
AND THE VAPORS
ARE TEMPORARILY NEUROTOXIC.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.363
- HE CONFESS TO MURDER YET?

18:50.397 --> 18:51.698
- HE'S TALKING
ELLIOT'S EAR OFF,

18:51.731 --> 18:53.233
BUT HE WON'T ANSWER
ANY QUESTIONS

18:53.266 --> 18:54.634
UNTIL HE KNOWS
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.369
- [sighs]

18:57.704 --> 18:59.839
OH!

18:59.872 --> 19:01.808
GIVE ME A RIDE?

19:01.841 --> 19:04.311
- THERE'S NOT A FERN
OR FIR TREE,

19:04.344 --> 19:06.646
WARTHOG OR WOMBAT,

19:06.679 --> 19:08.715
HIPPO OR...

19:08.748 --> 19:10.417
OR HUMAN BEING--

19:10.450 --> 19:12.419
NOTHING ON THIS PLANET

19:12.452 --> 19:15.355
CAN SURVIVE WITHOUT WATER.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.559
- HEY. GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE OKAY, OLIVIA.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.661
FUNGI SHOULD NEVER
HURT ANYONE.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.595
- GOT ANYTHING USEFUL YET?

19:22.629 --> 19:25.198
- UH, NO, BUT I'VE HAD IT
ABOUT UP TO HERE

19:25.232 --> 19:27.700
WITH "THE SUBTLE
AND THE DISGUSTING"?

19:27.734 --> 19:29.636
- SUBTLE AND THE GROSS,
DETECTIVE--

19:29.669 --> 19:32.705
GROSS AS IN BIG,
LIKE GROSS PROFIT.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.341
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
ON A BEACH?

19:34.374 --> 19:37.310
- WATCH THIS. HE KEEPS DOING
THESE SUDDEN MENTAL PIVOTS.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.811
- WAVES QUIETLY LAPPING,

19:38.845 --> 19:40.680
AND A BOOM BOX
STARTS BLARING!

19:40.713 --> 19:43.850
MAN SO READILY WRECKS
NATURE'S PEACE,

19:43.883 --> 19:47.720
BECAUSE NATURE IS DELICATE,
AND WE'RE SO HEAVY-HANDED.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.456
IT'S...

19:49.489 --> 19:50.790
IT'S DISGUSTING,
AS YOU SAY.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.793
- OKAY, WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT LINDSAY ELDING.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.662
- I AM.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.330
[scoffs]
DON'T YOU SEE?

19:57.364 --> 19:58.665
WATER IS SUBTLE.

19:58.698 --> 20:03.636
IT GOES, "SSS, SSS, SSS."

20:03.670 --> 20:06.005
LINDSAY'S CORPORATIONS GO,

20:06.038 --> 20:07.774
"MINE!

20:07.807 --> 20:10.577
MINE! MINE! MINE!"

20:10.610 --> 20:13.746
- AND YOU WANTED LINDSAY
TO DIE, DIE, DIE!

20:13.780 --> 20:14.981
- I DIDN'T KILL HER.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.550
- BUT YOU JUST TOLD US
YOUR MOTIVE.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.253
- WHY DIDN'T PROCHIK GET SICK
FROM THE MUSHROOM VAPOR?

20:20.287 --> 20:22.722
- HE BUILT UP A TOLERANCE
FROM YEARS OF EXPOSURE.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.857
- WOULD THAT EXPLAIN
THE UNUSUAL SPEECH PATTERNS

20:24.891 --> 20:25.992
AND WATER FIXATION?

20:26.025 --> 20:29.562
- YOU THINK HIS LAWYER MIGHT GO
FOR AN INSANITY DEFENSE?

20:29.596 --> 20:31.764
DR. PROCHIK
HOLDS A PROFESSORSHIP,

20:31.798 --> 20:32.799
PUBLISHES PAPERS,

20:32.832 --> 20:34.667
LEADS FORAGING TRIPS
TO BOLIVIA.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.803
HE'S ODD, BUT SANE.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.338
- THANKS, DOC.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.473
- MIKKA VON.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.774
DAVE SEAVER.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.743
THE MUSEUM CALLED
VINCENT PROCHIK'S SISTER

20:43.776 --> 20:44.811
AFTER HE WAS ARRESTED.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.413
SHE RETAINED ME AS COUNSEL.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.748
- DO I KNOW YOU?
- I'VE DEFENDED IN CHICAGO.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.917
YOUR REPUTATION,
I'M GLAD WE NEVER FACED OFF.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.752
- WELL, IF YOU NEED
A LITTLE PIED-A-TERRE,

20:52.785 --> 20:53.720
I'M SELLING MY LOFT.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.455
IT'S SUN-DRENCHED.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.956
- I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.726
NOW, UH, WHERE MIGHT I CHAT
WITH MY CLIENT?

20:59.759 --> 21:01.761
- AT ARRAIGNMENT.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.766
- REMAND
ON A CIRCUMSTANTIAL CASE

21:06.799 --> 21:07.834
WITH NO PRIORS.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.870
OUR NEW A.D.A. IS TESTING
HER WINGS, YOUR HONOR.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.673
- IT'S DR. PROCHIK'S WINGS
YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT.

21:13.706 --> 21:14.641
HE'S A FLIGHT RISK

21:14.674 --> 21:16.609
WITH TIES TO CRIMINAL ELEMENTS
IN BOLIVIA.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.077
- CITIZENS FIGHTING
FOR THEIR WATER RIGHTS

21:18.110 --> 21:19.646
ARE NOT CRIMINALS!

21:19.679 --> 21:20.747
- VINCENT, NOT ANOTHER WORD.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.616
- THANK YOU, MR. SEAVER.
PROCEED.

21:23.650 --> 21:24.751
- YOUR HONOR,
MY CLIENT HAS EVERY REASON

21:24.784 --> 21:25.918
TO REMAIN IN MANHATTAN.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.787
HIS EXTENSIVE COLLECTION
OF FUNGI

21:27.820 --> 21:29.789
IS BOTH PRECIOUS
AND IRREPLACEABLE.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.758
- MUSHROOMS
AREN'T EXACTLY CHILDREN.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.727
- MS. VON, HAVE YOU NOT HEARD
OF MY ROSES?

21:34.761 --> 21:36.429
- ROSES?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.898
- MY BEAUTIES TAKE FIRST PRIZE
AT THE PUTNAM COUNTY FAIR

21:38.931 --> 21:40.400
EVERY YEAR.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.835
I'D SOONER LEAVE MY WIFE.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.737
DEFENDANT WILL SURRENDER
HIS PASSPORT.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.806
BAIL'S SET AT $250,000.
[pounds gavel]

21:49.776 --> 21:51.744
- [chuckles]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:51.778 --> 21:53.413
- I THOUGHT I'D ESCORT YOU
DOWN THE STEPS.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.515
- I'VE BEEN THROUGH
A PRESS SCRUM.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.418
- NOT IN NEW YORK,
YOU HAVEN'T.

21:58.451 --> 21:59.852
- MS. VON!
- MS. VON!

21:59.886 --> 22:01.854
- CAN YOU MAKE A COMMENT?
DO YOU HAVE A STATEMENT?

22:01.888 --> 22:03.122
- MS. VON!
- NO COMMENT.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.757
- MS. VON, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO
SAY TO LINDSAY ELDING'S FAMILY?

22:04.791 --> 22:06.058
- NO COMMENT.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.894
- ARE THE MUSHROOMS
FROM PROCHIK'S LAB?

22:07.927 --> 22:10.530
- WHAT IS THE DEFENDANT'S
CONNECTION TO THE VICTIM?

22:10.563 --> 22:12.098
- WHY DON'T YOU ASK
THE DEFENDANT?

22:12.131 --> 22:13.800
HINT--
IT'S ABOUT WATER.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.802
- DR.--
- DR. PROCHIK!

22:15.835 --> 22:16.836
- TELL US ABOUT WATER.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.471
- WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT H2O?

22:18.505 --> 22:20.440
- IT'S THE ESSENCE OF LIFE.
WE NEED TO PROTECT IT.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.475
- VINCENT, SHUT UP.
- NO, I'M TALKING.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.711
ARE WE REALLY
SO PRO-BUSINESS

22:24.744 --> 22:27.714
THAT WE WANT CORPORATIONS
OWNING LIFE ITSELF?

22:27.747 --> 22:30.750
IN 2000, A BIG CONTRACTOR
CALLED BECHTEL

22:30.783 --> 22:32.118
HIJACKED THE WATER
OF BOLIVIA!

22:32.151 --> 22:34.421
WATER COMPANIES
ALL OVER THE WORLD

22:34.454 --> 22:35.888
ARE TRYING TO BUY OUR RIVER--

22:35.922 --> 22:37.924
- MEDIA'S TURNING DR. PROCHIK
INTO A HERO.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.559
- OR LETTING HIM
KNOT HIS OWN NOOSE.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.461
I CAN CONVICT HIM
IN MY SLEEP.

22:41.494 --> 22:42.562
- YOU STILL MAY WANT THIS.

22:42.595 --> 22:45.765
THE MUSHROOMS FROM PROCHIK'S LAB
ARE A GENETIC MATCH

22:45.798 --> 22:47.133
TO THE ONES
THAT KILLED LINDSAY.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.801
- SO UNLESS SOMEONE ELSE
WENT DOWN TO BOLIVIA

22:48.835 --> 22:50.470
AND PICKED
FROM THE SAME PATCH,

22:50.503 --> 22:52.405
MURDER WEAPON
BELONGS TO PROCHIK.

22:52.439 --> 22:54.607
- WHICH IS WHY WE WANT
TO DISCUSS A PLEA.

22:54.641 --> 22:55.675
- CAN YOU PLAY THAT?

22:55.708 --> 22:57.744
- THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF TV TIME
FOR YOU IN PRISON.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.513
- SHALL WE DISCUSS
TIME IN PRISON?

23:02.815 --> 23:04.951
- PUT THEM OVER THERE, EMMA.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.720
- MRS. BROOKS, EMMA.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.490
- ALL THE PHOTOS
FROM ALL THE PHOTOGRAPHERS,

23:10.523 --> 23:11.858
AS YOU REQUESTED.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.960
- SOME PRINTED,
SOME ON THIS FLASH DRIVE.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.028
- WELL, OF COURSE,
WE ALL WANT TO PUT

23:16.062 --> 23:17.830
LINDSAY'S KILLER AWAY.

23:17.864 --> 23:18.931
- THAT'S HIM.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.967
THAT'S LINDSAY'S KILLER.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.769
- NO, DON'T--DON'T--
DON'T STARE, EMMA.

23:22.802 --> 23:23.870
IT'S RUDE.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.573
- AND KILLING MY BEST FRIEND
WAS WHAT, A FAUX PAS?

23:26.606 --> 23:28.775
- I KNOW IT'S ALL THE RAGE
TO EMOTE IN PUBLIC,

23:28.808 --> 23:30.943
BUT IN MY DAY,
IT WASN'T DONE.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.479
- YOUR DAYS
ARE LONG GONE, GRAMMY.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.647
- I AM STILL HERE.
I AM STILL STRONG.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.849
AND NEVER IN MY LIFE
DID I RESORT--

23:36.883 --> 23:38.451
- RESORT TO DOING DRUGS.

23:38.485 --> 23:40.787
I KNOW. YOU'VE SAID IT
A MILLION TIMES.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.789
- SO LONG AS YOU WEAR
MY INTAGLIO NECKLACE,

23:42.822 --> 23:45.558
YOU WILL MIND YOUR MANNERS.

23:45.592 --> 23:48.661
IT'S BEEN IN MY FAMILY
FOR FIVE GENERATIONS.

23:48.695 --> 23:51.764
- MRS. BROOKS, HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN TO A FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP

23:51.798 --> 23:53.566
AT EMMA'S REHAB?

23:53.600 --> 23:56.102
- WITH ALL THOSE JUNKIES?
NO. NO, NO.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.004
THAT WAS LINDSAY'S ROLE.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.806
- DON'T YOU DARE SAY THAT!

23:59.839 --> 24:00.940
I SAID NO!

24:00.973 --> 24:02.809
- VINCENT, CALM DOWN.
- COME, EMMA, BEFORE HE SEES US.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.544
- ALL MY LIFE, PEOPLE HAVE
LOOKED AT ME LIKE I'M STRANGE,

24:04.577 --> 24:06.178
LIKE I'M FROM ANOTHER PLANET.
- JUST SLOW DOWN.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.781
- IF I GREW UP WITH THAT,
I'D DO DRUGS TOO.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.650
- OLIVIA!
I WANT OLIVIA!

24:10.683 --> 24:12.685
- DETECTIVE BENSON.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.656
- WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE?

24:16.689 --> 24:18.791
- WE'RE ASSERTING
A MENTAL DEFECT BROUGHT ON

24:18.825 --> 24:20.593
BY YEARS OF INHALING
MUSHROOM FUMES.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.762
- I'M NOT CRAZY!
TELL THEM, OLIVIA.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.196
- NO ONE'S SAYING YOU ARE.

24:24.230 --> 24:26.866
EXPOSURE TO TOXINS
MADE YOU TEMPORARILY INCAPABLE

24:26.899 --> 24:28.535
OF TELLING RIGHT FROM WRONG.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.637
- [scoffs]
CAN I FIRE HIM?

24:30.670 --> 24:33.540
- WHY DON'T WE TAKE A SECOND?
- YES, YOU CAN FIRE HIM.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.908
- YOU'RE FIRED.
- VINCENT, TAKE A SEAT.

24:35.942 --> 24:38.645
- HAS EXPOSURE TO COLOGNE
MADE YOU DEAF?

24:38.678 --> 24:40.146
GO AWAY.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.921
- BIG MISTAKE.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.259
- DO--DO YOU THINK
I'M CRAZY?

24:53.292 --> 24:55.662
- I THINK YOU NEED
AN ATTORNEY.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.296
- I'M GONNA PLEAD GUILTY.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.666
- YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR PLEA
WITHOUT A LAWYER.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.534
BUT THIS IS A POLICE BUILDING.

25:01.568 --> 25:04.604
I'M SURE THERE'S ONE
HERE SOMEWHERE.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.873
- AT, UM, THIS TIME,
YOUR HONOR,

25:06.906 --> 25:10.176
THE, UH, DEFENSE
WOULD LIKE TO PLEAD GUILTY

25:10.209 --> 25:11.778
TO MURDER, PURSUANT--

25:11.811 --> 25:14.647
- THERE IS NO COUNT OF MURDER
ON OUR BOOKS.

25:14.681 --> 25:17.083
WHAT ARE YOU PLEADING?

25:17.116 --> 25:20.019
- [chuckles awkwardly]
MURDER TWO, YOUR HONOR.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.121
- DR. PROCHIK,

25:22.154 --> 25:24.290
YOU'RE AWARE OF THE NATURE
OF THE CHARGES AGAINST YOU,

25:24.323 --> 25:26.292
AND YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR PLEA
AND YOUR LAWYER

25:26.325 --> 25:27.894
OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL?

25:27.927 --> 25:30.262
- I AM, YOUR HONOR.
COPS CAN VOUCH FOR THAT.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.298
- OKAY, LET'S HEAR
YOUR ALLOCUTION.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.767
- I PUT THE MUSHROOMS
ON LINDSAY ELDING'S SALAD.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.636
UH, I WANTED HER DEAD,

25:36.669 --> 25:38.838
BECAUSE SHE WAS TRYING
TO CORPORATIZE WATER.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.306
- SPECIFICS, DR. PROCHIK--

25:40.339 --> 25:42.208
WHAT TIME? WHAT DAY?
WHAT KIND OF MUSHROOMS?

25:42.241 --> 25:43.876
HOW MANY?
- OH, YEAH.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.946
UH, THREE SPECIES
OF SOUTH AMERICAN MUSHROOM.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.682
IT WAS, UH, 8:00
ON MONDAY NIGHT.

25:49.716 --> 25:50.883
I WENT TO THAT FUNDRAISER.

25:50.917 --> 25:53.853
UH, KIDS WERE CLIMBING
A JUNGLE GYM.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.021
I WAITED TILL NO ONE
WAS LOOKING.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.856
I DROPPED THOSE THREE KINDS
OF MUSHROOMS ON HER PLATE.

25:56.889 --> 25:57.890
- VON, COME HERE.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.191
- YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE HAD A DAUGHTER.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.660
- CALL A RECESS.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

26:00.693 --> 26:01.794
- THAT'S THE ONLY REMORSE
I HAVE.

26:01.828 --> 26:02.962
- WE MADE A MISTAKE.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.296
- MS. VON,
IS THIS REALLY THE TIME

26:04.330 --> 26:05.765
TO BE TALKING
WITH YOUR COPS?

26:05.798 --> 26:06.966
- NO, YOUR HONOR,
DETECTIVE STABLER

26:06.999 --> 26:08.768
WAS JUST SITTING DOWN.

26:08.801 --> 26:09.769
- UH, YOUR HONOR,
IF--IF I MAY--

26:09.802 --> 26:11.303
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TONIGHT IS?

26:11.337 --> 26:13.906
- UH, SEASON OPENER
AT THE GARDEN?

26:13.940 --> 26:15.608
- AND I HAVE COURTSIDE SEATS.

26:15.642 --> 26:17.209
SO SIT DOWN,
OR I'LL FINE YOU

26:17.243 --> 26:19.345
AS MUCH AS THOSE DAMN SEATS
COST ME.

26:19.378 --> 26:21.313
- YOUR HONOR--
- DETECTIVE, I AM NOT JOKING.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.850
- I'M NOT JOKING EITHER.
- SIT DOWN!

26:26.118 --> 26:28.220
CONTINUE, DR. PROCHIK.

26:28.254 --> 26:31.323
- UH, YES, I KILLED
THE COLA QUEEN,

26:31.357 --> 26:33.059
BECAUSE SHE WAS
TRYING TO PLAY GOD.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.127
WHO SHALL LIVE
AND WHO SHALL DIE?

26:35.161 --> 26:36.863
- HOT!
- OUR VERY SURVIVAL
DEPENDS ON FRESH WATER!

26:36.896 --> 26:38.831
- HOT.
BOY, IS IT HOT IN HERE.

26:38.865 --> 26:40.933
- DETECTIVE STABLER!
- ISN'T IT HOT IN HERE?

26:40.967 --> 26:42.401
I DIDN'T ORDER THAT PIZZA.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.804
I DIDN'T ORDER THAT PIZZA.
I DON'T EVEN LIKE ANCHOVIES.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.405
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS GET TO THE GARDEN--

26:46.438 --> 26:48.207
- THAT'S IT.
I FIND YOU IN CONTEMPT!

26:48.240 --> 26:49.676
- YOUR HONOR,
DETECTIVE STABLER...

26:49.709 --> 26:50.542
- OFFICERS, RESTRAIN THIS MAN.

26:50.576 --> 26:52.211
- WAS EXPOSED
TO NEUROTOXIC MUSHROOMS

26:52.244 --> 26:53.980
IN THE LINE OF DUTY--
HE'S NOT IN COMPOS MENTIS.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.682
- YOUR HONOR,
AL AND MIKE AND TODD,

26:55.715 --> 26:56.783
WE'RE GONNA GO WATER-SKIING
AT THE GARDEN.

26:56.816 --> 26:57.784
- CALL AN AMBULANCE.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.251
- I DIDN'T ORDER THAT PIZZA.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.987
YOUR HONOR,
I'M NOT EVEN A FAN OF ANCHOVIES.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.021
BOY, IS IT HOT IN HERE!

27:05.925 --> 27:07.694
- DOC SAYS NOTHING'S WRONG
WITH YOU.

27:07.727 --> 27:11.263
- AH, YEAH, I GUESS IT PASSED.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.832
LOOK, I'M SORRY,

27:12.865 --> 27:15.034
BUT I DID TELL YOU
THAT I NEEDED A RECESS.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.235
YOU REALLY GAVE ME NO CHOICE.

27:16.268 --> 27:17.904
- I SHOULD GIVE YOU
A BEATDOWN.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.238
- PROCHIK SAID
HE DOSED LINDSAY

27:19.271 --> 27:20.807
WITH THREE
DIFFERENT MUSHROOMS.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.008
THERE WERE FOUR.

27:22.041 --> 27:22.842
NOW, A MAN LIKE HIM

27:22.875 --> 27:24.677
DOESN'T FORGET
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

27:24.711 --> 27:26.278
- YOU ARE HIGH.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.380
- OKAY, YOU WANT TO CONVICT
AN INNOCENT MAN

27:28.414 --> 27:29.949
YOUR FIRST CASE
OUT OF THE GATE?

27:29.982 --> 27:30.883
- I WANT MY FIRST CASE

27:30.917 --> 27:33.119
NOT TO MAKE ME LOOK
LIKE A TOTAL FLAKE.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.154
- [sighs]

27:35.187 --> 27:36.989
- YOU REALLY THINK
IT WASN'T PROCHIK?

27:37.023 --> 27:39.191
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'D LIKE A LITTLE MORE TIME

27:39.225 --> 27:41.728
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON AROUND HERE.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.696
- YOU HAVE UNTIL 9:00
TOMORROW MORNING

27:43.730 --> 27:46.866
TO CONVINCE ME SOMEONE ELSE
KILLED LINDSAY ELDING.

27:46.899 --> 27:49.902
- I GOT KIDS WITH FACE PAINT
AND ADULTS WITH COCKTAILS.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.137
- ALL I GOT IS A HEADACHE.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.272
- NO ONE DROPPING
TOXIC 'SHROOMS

27:53.305 --> 27:54.841
IN THE VICTIM'S SALAD.

27:54.874 --> 27:57.744
- YOU CAN THANK STABLER
FOR OUR ALL-NIGHTER.

27:57.777 --> 28:00.012
WHAT?
I'M HERE, AREN'T I?

28:00.046 --> 28:01.013
YOU KNOW, TEAM PLAYER.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.816
- YEAH. OKAY, SO WE GOT
A TIME-STAMPED PHOTO.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.352
7:51--THERE'S NOTHING
ON LINDSAY'S SALAD.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.722
BY 8:02...

28:09.756 --> 28:11.791
'SHROOMS HAVE BEEN DROPPED.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.793
- SO WHO CAME NEAR HER TABLE
IN THOSE 11 MINUTES?

28:13.826 --> 28:14.861
- THESE PEOPLE--

28:14.894 --> 28:17.864
FRANCINE BROOKS AND HER
GRANDDAUGHTER EMMA BROOKS.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.098
- WHO'S HE?

28:19.131 --> 28:21.868
- STUFFED SHIRT--
I MEAN, LINDSAY'S BOSS.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.771
- AND THIS IS PHIL MCPEAL
FROM THE ATHLETIC CENTER.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.873
THE REST OF THESE PEOPLE
HAVE YET TO BE I.D.'D.

28:26.906 --> 28:29.909
- AND GUESS WHO WASN'T ANYWHERE
NEAR LINDSAY'S TABLE.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.277
- PROFESSOR PROCHIK.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.746
- WHAT'S SHE DOING?

28:33.780 --> 28:35.948
- IS SHE CALLING THE D.A.
TO ASK FOR A DELAY?

28:35.982 --> 28:37.449
- THAT,
OR SHE'S ORDERING CHINESE.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.786
- OKAY, WHO HERE HAS MOTIVE?

28:39.819 --> 28:42.221
WAS SHE HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH THE COACH OR HER BOSS?

28:42.254 --> 28:43.990
- OR MAYBE ONE
OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE

28:44.023 --> 28:45.224
HATED LINDSAY
FOR SOME OTHER REASON.

28:45.257 --> 28:48.460
- FOLKS, I GOT TO GET
MY BEAUTY REST.

28:48.494 --> 28:49.762
- YOU'RE LEAVING?

28:49.796 --> 28:51.430
- THIS IS GONNA TAKE DAYS,
NOT HOURS.

28:51.463 --> 28:52.999
AND I'M NOT GONNA DELAY
A SOLID CASE

28:53.032 --> 28:55.001
'CAUSE PROCHIK
MISSED A MUSHROOM.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.937
NO WONDER YOU GUYS
GO THROUGH A.D.A.s SO FAST.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.105
- YEAH, SO SCREW JUSTICE.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.940
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS YOUR CONVICTION RATE?

29:00.973 --> 29:03.976
- [chuckles]
LET'S BE CLEAR HOW THIS WORKS.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.011
- OH, OKAY.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.279
- YOU GUYS ARE THE POTS
AND PANS.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.115
I'M THE CHEF.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.451
- TEAM PLAYER, HUH?

29:12.484 --> 29:14.787
- SEE YOU IN COURT.

29:18.424 --> 29:21.060
- HAS ANYONE SEEN
OUR DEFENSE ATTORNEY?

29:23.963 --> 29:24.997
FEELING BETTER, DETECTIVE?

29:25.031 --> 29:26.899
- UH, YES.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.801
GO, KNICKS.

29:32.972 --> 29:36.475
- SEEMS DEFENSE COUNSEL
HAS GONE ON VACATION.

29:36.508 --> 29:39.478
FORGOT TO INFORM,
SENDS APOLOGIES, ET CETERA.

29:39.511 --> 29:41.113
GET HIM ON THE PHONE.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.382
LET'S SEE IF HE CAN SQUIRM
OUT OF A CONTEMPT CITATION.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.117
[pounds gavel]

29:45.151 --> 29:46.953
- YOU GOT PROCHIK
THE WORST POSSIBLE LAWYER?

29:46.986 --> 29:48.254
- OR THE BEST.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.457
ONE THAT'S NOT HERE
GIVES US DAYS, NOT HOURS.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.259
- SO THAT WAS THE CALL
YOU MADE LAST NIGHT, HUH?

29:53.292 --> 29:54.927
WHAT'D YOU DO,
SEND HIM ON VACATION

29:54.961 --> 29:56.028
TO A SUN-DRENCHED LOFT
IN CHICAGO?

29:56.062 --> 30:00.867
- OH, WELL, KID LOOKED LIKE
HE COULD USE SOME R&R.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.568
I THINK WE'RE GONNA MAKE
A GREAT TEAM.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.971
- ME TOO. CAP!

30:07.539 --> 30:09.241
HOW'S THE OLD PLACE?

30:09.275 --> 30:11.911
- IT'S, UH--
IT'S ALL GETTING SQUARED AWAY.

30:11.944 --> 30:14.080
- CAPTAIN CRAGEN, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING YOU.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.447
MIKKA VON, YOUR NEW A.D.A.

30:15.481 --> 30:19.051
- YEAH, WELL,
NICE KNOWING YOU.

30:19.085 --> 30:20.853
YOUR BOSS CALLED.
HE'S TIED UP.

30:20.887 --> 30:23.389
ASKED ME TO DELIVER
A MESSAGE--

30:23.422 --> 30:25.892
PACK YOUR BAGS,
GO BACK TO CHICAGO.

30:25.925 --> 30:28.895
- [scoffs]
I'M BEING FIRED BY PROXY?

30:28.928 --> 30:29.828
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:29.862 --> 30:32.231
- APPARENTLY, YOU SENT
A DEFENSE ATTORNEY

30:32.264 --> 30:34.901
ON VACATION SUB ROSA.

30:34.934 --> 30:36.568
D.A. DOESN'T LIKE
DIRTY TRICKS.

30:36.602 --> 30:37.904
- UNLESS HE'S THE ONE
DOING THEM.

30:37.937 --> 30:40.039
- I'M SORRY.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.941
- WELL...

30:41.974 --> 30:45.311
I GUESS I GOT TO GO TAKE MY LOFT
OFF THE MARKET.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.081
- BEEN NICE WORKING WITH YOU.

30:49.115 --> 30:51.918
- BACK AT YA.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.552
[chuckles softly]

30:55.187 --> 30:57.924
- IS SHE ONE OF THE GOOD ONES?

30:57.957 --> 30:59.591
- YEAH.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.560
- DID THE CAPTAIN SAY
WHO'S REPLACING MIKKA?

31:01.593 --> 31:04.897
- ONLY THAT THEY'RE POACHING
SOME HOTSHOT OUT OF BROOKLYN.

31:04.931 --> 31:07.499
DR. PROCHIK.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.600
- [sighs]

31:08.634 --> 31:10.669
MY LAWYER SAID I DIDN'T HAVE
TO GO TO COURT TODAY.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.138
- AND YOU NEVER
WILL HAVE TO AGAIN,

31:12.171 --> 31:16.008
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO IT,
DID YOU?

31:16.042 --> 31:18.444
- NOW, WHY WOULD YOU CONFESS
TO A MURDER YOU DIDN'T COMMIT?

31:20.079 --> 31:21.547
- FOR THE CAUSE.

31:21.580 --> 31:25.184
YOU SAW ME ON TV.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.586
FOLKS WERE FINALLY
STARTING TO PAY ATTENTION.

31:27.619 --> 31:30.656
- SO YOU WERE WILLING
TO GO TO PRISON FOR A SOAPBOX.

31:30.689 --> 31:34.093
- SOME THINGS IN LIFE
ARE DEAR, OLIVIA.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.328
- WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW
IS WHO HAD ACCESS TO YOUR LAB

31:36.362 --> 31:37.596
TO STEAL THOSE MUSHROOMS?

31:37.629 --> 31:39.698
- RESEARCHERS
COME THROUGH HERE,

31:39.731 --> 31:44.103
UH, ADMINISTRATORS,
THE V.I.P. MUSEUM TOUR.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.572
- ANY OF THESE PEOPLE?

31:46.605 --> 31:49.708
- NO.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.577
NO.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.583
NO.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.287
N-NO.
NONE OF THEM.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.323
SORRY.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.259
NOW, WOULD YOU JUST LEAVE?

32:13.665 --> 32:14.733
- YOU SAW THAT, RIGHT?

32:14.766 --> 32:16.735
- STOPPED ON THE PHOTO
OF EMMA BROOKS.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.005
- BUT HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
- HE'S PROTECTING HER.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.647
- THE COPS SHOWED ME
YOUR PHOTO.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.582
- GET OUT OF HERE, VINNY!
- BUT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

32:30.616 --> 32:31.717
- ARE YOU CRAZY, COMING HERE?

32:31.750 --> 32:33.352
- HEY.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.287
YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T KNOW HER.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.456
- AND YOU TOLD US
HE WAS JUST A HOMELESS GUY.

32:37.489 --> 32:38.991
NOW HE'S "VINNY"?

32:39.025 --> 32:41.460
- EMMA, YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

32:41.493 --> 32:43.062
- YEAH, THEY'RE ACCOMPLICES.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.063
- NO.

32:44.096 --> 32:45.297
- THE PROFESSOR HERE

32:45.331 --> 32:46.598
PROVIDED THE MUSHROOMS,

32:46.632 --> 32:48.534
AND EMMA TOSSED THEM
IN LINDSAY'S SALAD.

32:48.567 --> 32:51.503
- EMMA...
YOU MURDERED HER?

32:51.537 --> 32:52.771
- NO! NO.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.473
IT WAS ALL ME.
I DID IT MYSELF.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.641
- GRAMMY...

32:55.674 --> 32:57.443
I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE!
- THAT'S RIGHT!

32:57.476 --> 33:01.213
I MURDERED LINDSAY ELDING!
I GAVE HER THOSE MUSHROOMS!

33:01.247 --> 33:02.148
- ABOUT THOSE MUSHROOMS,

33:02.181 --> 33:04.283
WHICH TOXINS DID YOU PICK
TO KILL LINDSAY?

33:04.316 --> 33:06.018
NOW, BEFORE YOU ANSWER,
YOU SHOULD KNOW

33:06.052 --> 33:09.155
THAT I HAVE THE AUTOPSY REPORT
RIGHT HERE.

33:09.188 --> 33:12.258
- IBOTENIC ACID--
FAST-ACTING AND DEADLY.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.260
- WELL, YOU CERTAINLY KNOW
YOUR MUSHROOMS, PROFESSOR.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.795
SO IF YOU DID IT,
OR IF YOU CONSPIRED WITH EMMA,

33:16.828 --> 33:19.631
YOU WOULD KNOW
WHICH ONES LINDSAY TOOK.

33:19.665 --> 33:23.035
- MUSCARINE.

33:23.069 --> 33:26.238
IT WAS MU--
IT WAS MUSCARINE.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.640
RIGHT?

33:28.674 --> 33:30.242
- IS THAT YOUR FINAL ANSWER?

33:33.845 --> 33:36.082
SO EMMA STOLE THE MUSHROOMS
FROM YOUR LAB.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.149
- STOLE THEM?

33:37.183 --> 33:38.684
I--I NEVER WENT TO HIS LAB.

33:38.717 --> 33:41.053
- MM-HMM. WELL, C.S.U.
SEARCHED YOUR APARTMENT

33:41.087 --> 33:43.155
AND FOUND THE EXACT SAME TYPE
OF MUSHROOMS

33:43.189 --> 33:46.092
THAT WERE USED TO KILL
LINDSAY ELDING.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.327
SO HOW DID YOU
AND THE PROFESSOR MEET?

33:48.360 --> 33:52.064
- EMMA CAME
TO OUR WATER-RIGHTS GROUP...

33:52.098 --> 33:54.633
APRIL 7TH--

33:54.666 --> 33:58.237
SUCH FIRE IN HER EYES
FOR THE PLANET.

33:58.270 --> 34:01.240
SHE TOLD US ABOUT HER GRANDMA'S
LAND DEAL IN THE CATSKILLS.

34:01.273 --> 34:02.741
- WHAT LAND DEAL?

34:02.774 --> 34:05.311
- WITH LINDSAY ELDING.

34:05.344 --> 34:09.115
THAT WOMAN WAS QUIETLY BUYING
UPSTATE LAND

34:09.148 --> 34:11.783
AND SELLING THE WATER RIGHTS
TO COLANOW.

34:11.817 --> 34:16.155
- LINDSAY COZIED UP TO GRANNY
AND GOT HER TO SELL THE ESTATE.

34:16.188 --> 34:19.325
LET ME GUESS--GRANNY'S LAND
HAS LOTS OF WATER ON IT.

34:19.358 --> 34:22.528
- COLANOW
TAPS THAT AQUIFER...

34:22.561 --> 34:24.796
HALF OF NEW YORK CITY
DRIES UP.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.766
- I ASKED GRAMMY NOT
TO SELL THAT LAND TO LINDSAY...

34:27.799 --> 34:29.501
BEGGED HER.

34:29.535 --> 34:31.803
- BUT SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN
TO YOU.

34:31.837 --> 34:34.806
BECAUSE IN GRAMMY'S EYES...

34:34.840 --> 34:37.109
HOW DID SHE PUT IT?

34:37.143 --> 34:41.480
[imitating Mrs. Brooks]
LINDSAY'S AN AMAZING WOMAN.

34:41.513 --> 34:42.848
BUT YOU...

34:42.881 --> 34:45.117
- I'M JUST A REHAB SCREWUP.

34:45.151 --> 34:48.320
- SHE'S NOT A SCREWUP.

34:48.354 --> 34:52.358
SHE'S A SUBTLE PERSON
IN A LOUD WORLD.

34:52.391 --> 34:55.594
- YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HER.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.896
THAT'S WHY
YOU PLEADED GUILTY.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.131
- [chuckles softly]

34:59.165 --> 35:02.901
OH, I LIKE
THE SOAPBOX TOO, BUT...

35:02.934 --> 35:04.670
YES.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.605
EMMA AND I ARE IN LOVE.

35:06.638 --> 35:07.906
- LOVE?

35:07.939 --> 35:09.775
IN MY FAMILY,
LOVE IS ABOUT BEING

35:09.808 --> 35:11.810
AT THE RIGHT EVENT
IN THE RIGHT DRESS,

35:11.843 --> 35:13.512
GOSSIPING
ABOUT SOCIAL TWADDLE.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.681
I'VE--
I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT.

35:15.714 --> 35:18.284
- BUT LINDSAY DID.

35:18.317 --> 35:20.819
SHE'S GRANDMA'S DREAM GIRL...

35:24.256 --> 35:25.757
SO YOU KILLED HER.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.327
- I DIDN'T KILL HER.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.496
- WELL, I'LL BET YOU IF LINDSAY
WERE SITTING IN THAT CHAIR,

35:30.529 --> 35:33.499
FRANCINE BROOKS WOULD HAVE RACED
RIGHT DOWN HERE...

35:33.532 --> 35:36.902
TO MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

35:38.504 --> 35:40.572
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT...

35:40.606 --> 35:43.375
WHY DON'T WE SEE ABOUT THAT?

35:54.286 --> 35:56.822
- NOPE.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.724
NO GRANNY.

35:58.757 --> 36:01.327
AND SHE REALLY DOESN'T GIVE
A DAMN ABOUT YOU,

36:01.360 --> 36:02.928
DOES SHE?

36:02.961 --> 36:06.465
- SHE LOVES ME.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.800
- LIKE YOU LOVE VINNY?

36:08.834 --> 36:09.635
YOU MEET SOME ODDBALL GUY--

36:09.668 --> 36:11.837
- HE'S NOT ODD.
HE'S HIS OWN PERSON.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.972
- AFTER A FEW KISSES, HE TEACHES
YOU ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW

36:14.005 --> 36:15.874
ABOUT DEADLY MUSHROOMS.

36:15.907 --> 36:19.511
WHEN HE'S NOT LOOKING,
YOU STUFF THEM INTO YOUR PURSE.

36:19.545 --> 36:22.248
KIND OF LIKE THAT,
PROFESSOR?

36:22.281 --> 36:23.515
- HE'S OUT THERE?

36:23.549 --> 36:26.585
- JUST TELLING US THE TRUTH
BEHIND YOUR LIES.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.554
- SHE CAN'T SEE ME?
- OR HEAR YOU.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.930
- VINNY, I'M SORRY.

36:38.964 --> 36:39.865
- YOU'RE SORRY?

36:39.898 --> 36:42.701
YOU SAW HIM UNDER ARREST
AND SAID NOTHING.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.503
- NO.
VINNY, I LOVE YOU.

36:44.536 --> 36:45.737
- MM-HMM.
REALLY?

36:45.771 --> 36:50.676
SO MUCH THAT YOU WANTED HIM
TO DO YOUR PRISON TIME FOR YOU.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.944
- I CAN'T--I CAN'T. I--

36:52.978 --> 36:54.880
IT'S JUST I CAN'T--
- YOU CAN'T?

36:54.913 --> 36:57.416
YOU CAN'T CONFESS TO MURDERING
THE MOTHER OF A NINE-YEAR-OLD?

36:57.449 --> 36:58.917
- LET ME IN THERE.
- NOT A CHANCE.

36:58.950 --> 37:02.854
- HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HER
LITTLE GIRL IS CRYING RIGHT NOW?

37:02.888 --> 37:04.856
- [crying]
PLEASE JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.426
- NO, YOU LOVE VINNY.

37:07.459 --> 37:09.895
NOW'S YOUR TIME TO TELL HIM
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE HIM.

37:09.928 --> 37:12.398
TO HIS FACE.
HMM?

37:15.634 --> 37:17.669
- VINNY...

37:17.703 --> 37:19.771
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

37:19.805 --> 37:23.509
- [voice breaking]
I KNOW, EMMA. I KNOW.

37:23.542 --> 37:24.776
- WHAT'D YOU WANT
TO SAY TO HIM?

37:24.810 --> 37:27.846
- THAT I KILLED
THAT TWO-FACED BITCH.

37:27.879 --> 37:31.283
YOU--YOU THINK LINDSAY
GAVE A RAT'S ASS ABOUT ME?

37:31.317 --> 37:32.951
SHE WALKED RIGHT OVER ME
TO GET TO GRAMMY.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.853
AS SOON AS SHE DIES,
I'M GARBAGE,

37:34.886 --> 37:37.356
AS FAR AS GRAM'S CONCERNED.

37:37.389 --> 37:38.990
NOT A--NOT A KIND WORD,

37:39.024 --> 37:41.760
NOT AN OUNCE OF LOVE.

37:41.793 --> 37:44.963
WHO AM I KIDDING?

37:44.996 --> 37:47.399
THERE NEVER WAS ANY.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.939
- IT WASN'T ABOUT THE WATER.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.575
IT WAS ABOUT REVENGE.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.810
- THE ONLY WATER I SEE
IS TEARS.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.579
SAY GOOD-BYE.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.548
- EMMA!
- HEY!

38:02.581 --> 38:03.549
- LET ME TALK TO HER!

38:03.582 --> 38:04.816
LET ME IN!
I NEED TO SEE HER!

38:04.850 --> 38:06.618
- EMMA, NO.
SHE'S GOT THE MUSHROOMS.

38:06.652 --> 38:07.553
- EMMA!

38:07.586 --> 38:08.887
- [grunting with mouth full]
- EMMA, NO!

38:08.920 --> 38:10.756
EMMA...
- I'LL CALL A BUS.

38:10.789 --> 38:11.990
- EMMA, GET 'EM
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH!

38:12.023 --> 38:14.526
EMMA, GET 'EM OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.
- [gasping]

38:16.428 --> 38:19.898
TELL GRANDMA SHE'S RID
OF THE PROBLEM CHILD.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.801
[gasping]

38:29.508 --> 38:31.477
- THE DOCTORS
PUMPED YOUR STOMACH.

38:31.510 --> 38:34.813
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.582
WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

38:39.385 --> 38:41.687
- GRAMMY.
YOU CAME?

38:41.720 --> 38:43.489
- OF COURSE.

38:43.522 --> 38:44.823
- [sniffles]

38:44.856 --> 38:46.858
I KNOW I SCREWED UP.

38:46.892 --> 38:48.827
I JUST--I WANTED--

38:48.860 --> 38:50.562
- YOU WILL TAKE
YOUR HAND OFF ME.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.800
- WHAT?
BUT--BUT, GRAM--

38:54.833 --> 38:58.837
- YOU ARE NOT MY GRANDCHILD.

38:58.870 --> 39:02.974
I CAME
ONLY FOR MY INTAGLIO.

39:05.811 --> 39:08.013
- YOU'RE REALLY
GONNA TAKE IT?

39:08.046 --> 39:10.849
SHE COULD USE IT TO PAY
FOR A DEFENSE ATTORNEY.

39:10.882 --> 39:11.883
- I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

39:11.917 --> 39:15.954
- JUST LIKE YOU WOULD NEVER
WRECK MY MERCEDES?

39:15.987 --> 39:20.659
OR LOSE YOUR VIRGINITY
AT 15?

39:20.692 --> 39:23.161
OR STUFF THAT GARBAGE
UP YOUR NOSE.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.998
- [crying]
I'M SORRY.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.936
- I'M GIVING THIS
TO LINDSAY'S DAUGHTER.

39:34.673 --> 39:37.108
YOU WILL INHERIT NOTHING.

39:37.142 --> 39:39.578
- YOU THINK
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED--

39:39.611 --> 39:41.947
YOUR MONEY?

39:41.980 --> 39:44.550
- I DON'T FRANKLY CARE.

39:47.986 --> 39:51.189
- I JUST WANTED A MOM.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.191
- YES, WELL...

39:53.224 --> 39:56.995
[sighs]
SHE DIED.

39:57.028 --> 40:00.432
- [sobbing]

40:04.736 --> 40:07.205
- PROFESSOR...

40:07.238 --> 40:10.942
DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU HERE.

40:10.976 --> 40:12.911
- I'M HERE FOR EMMA.

40:12.944 --> 40:15.747
- AFTER SHE STOOD BY
AND LET YOU TAKE THE FALL?

40:21.620 --> 40:23.555
- NOBODY'S PERFECT.

40:30.095 --> 40:30.161
