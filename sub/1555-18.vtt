(Finch)
We are being watched.

00:04.231 --> 00:06.365
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.367 --> 00:10.669
a Machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.671 --> 00:13.339
I designed the Machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.341 --> 00:15.174
but it sees everything...

00:15.176 --> 00:18.577
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.579 --> 00:21.580
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.582 --> 00:23.582
We don't.

00:23.584 --> 00:28.186
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.188 --> 00:30.021
You will never find us.

00:30.023 --> 00:32.189
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.192 --> 00:35.126
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

Hello!

00:43.904 --> 00:46.805
I-- I've been
eager to meet you.

00:46.807 --> 00:49.407
You're sure you installed
it in her computer?

00:49.409 --> 00:51.942
Quite sure.

00:51.944 --> 00:53.544
(man)
Elizabeth Bridges.

00:53.546 --> 00:55.813
Samaritan is becoming
very interested

00:55.815 --> 00:57.415
in her algorithms.

00:57.417 --> 00:58.549
(man over phone)
We're very eager to meet you.

00:58.551 --> 01:00.384
See you in a month.

01:05.156 --> 01:08.158
20,000 buy-in.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.293
Welcome to the game.

01:10.295 --> 01:11.995
- Let me get you a drink.
- Thanks a lot.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.168
(Reese)
I raise you 50,000.

01:18.170 --> 01:20.838
- Hi, Ray!
- Welcome!

01:20.840 --> 01:22.672
(man)
Re-raise 60,000.

01:22.674 --> 01:25.408
- I call.
- Cards please.

01:25.410 --> 01:26.776
(Reese)
Full house.

01:26.778 --> 01:29.212
[crowd reacts]

01:31.315 --> 01:33.483
(Finch) I confess to
some relief, Mr. Reese.

01:33.485 --> 01:34.884
I was starting to wonder
what we'd do

01:34.886 --> 01:36.720
if you lost all our money.

01:36.722 --> 01:37.987
(Reese)
Relax, Finch.

01:37.989 --> 01:40.890
Trust the poker face.

01:40.892 --> 01:42.725
Congratulations, sir.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.426
I was hoping you'd beat Toby.

01:44.428 --> 01:47.930
The girls tell me he's
a terrible tipper.

01:47.932 --> 01:49.632
(Finch)
Meet our new number.

01:49.634 --> 01:51.367
Francesca "Frankie" Wells.

01:51.369 --> 01:53.269
Born and raised in
Hammerton, Florida.

01:53.271 --> 01:55.404
Population, 8,000.

01:55.406 --> 01:57.106
She arrived four days ago
and tonight

01:57.108 --> 01:59.575
is her first turn as hostess

01:59.577 --> 02:01.843
at your semi-illicit card game.

02:01.845 --> 02:03.211
And her new boss?

02:03.213 --> 02:05.046
(Finch)
Ray... no last name.

02:05.048 --> 02:07.349
Man of mystery.

02:07.351 --> 02:09.618
- [glasses crash]
- Oh, geez, I am so, so sorry!

02:09.620 --> 02:11.019
[chuckles]
You are so fired.

02:11.020 --> 02:12.621
Here-- let me-- let me
get you a new shirt.

02:12.623 --> 02:13.955
- Stop. Relax. Relax.
- Look, I really need this job.

02:13.957 --> 02:15.791
- I'm sorry. I-- I can just--
- Relax!

02:15.793 --> 02:17.058
- Come on, come on. Let's go.
- ...this job. I really--

02:17.060 --> 02:18.693
He's got a temper.

02:18.695 --> 02:20.595
- It's okay, everybody!
- Please, please!

02:20.597 --> 02:22.730
I think we just found our perp.

02:22.732 --> 02:24.732
- [Francesca rambles]
- [Ray shushes]

02:27.703 --> 02:30.038
- [groans]
- [kicks]

02:30.040 --> 02:31.606
Unh!

02:31.608 --> 02:33.040
We're taking a ride, Ray.

02:33.042 --> 02:36.377
Frankie, are you okay?

02:36.379 --> 02:38.045
Back off. He's mine.

02:38.047 --> 02:39.980
Let him go.

02:40.849 --> 02:42.517
[kick]

02:42.519 --> 02:46.321
[fighting efforts]

02:47.856 --> 02:49.123
Enough.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.625
- Drop it! Drop the gun!
- Oh, thank God.

02:51.627 --> 02:52.793
Pervert.

02:55.197 --> 02:56.530
Easy now.

02:56.532 --> 02:58.498
I'm a cop.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.600
I'm just reaching for my badge.

03:04.605 --> 03:06.206
Damn.

03:06.208 --> 03:07.708
She stole my badge.

03:13.815 --> 03:16.149
(Root)
I've missed you, Harold.

03:16.151 --> 03:17.317
(Finch)
Ms. Groves.

03:17.319 --> 03:19.519
Long time, no see.

03:19.521 --> 03:21.687
Is something going on?

03:21.689 --> 03:22.822
You seem distracted.

03:22.824 --> 03:24.490
Not distracted, departing.

03:24.492 --> 03:26.292
I'm going to have coffee
with someone that

03:26.294 --> 03:28.627
Professor Whistler met
at a conference in Hong Kong

03:28.629 --> 03:30.029
a few months ago.

03:30.031 --> 03:31.264
A female someone, judging by

03:31.266 --> 03:33.933
the color in your cheeks.

03:33.935 --> 03:36.635
Good day, Miss Groves.

03:44.444 --> 03:46.846
[taps on glass]

03:46.848 --> 03:49.047
Mr. Flint, this
is good news.

03:49.049 --> 03:51.316
When will you begin
the field test on your system?

03:51.318 --> 03:53.285
(Flint) As soon as you send
us a completed algorithm.

03:53.287 --> 03:57.022
My employer's very pleased with
your progress, Miss Bridges.

03:57.024 --> 04:00.259
The next tranche of funds
has been wired to your account.

04:00.261 --> 04:02.160
Great, thank you so much.

04:02.162 --> 04:05.130
9:14 Harold. You're
a minute early.

04:05.132 --> 04:07.366
Hmm.

04:07.368 --> 04:09.067
Just in time to hear
some good news?

04:09.069 --> 04:10.869
I was just talking
to my angel investor

04:10.871 --> 04:13.971
about my situational
analysis project.

04:13.973 --> 04:16.040
Your so-called
"predictive algorithm." Yes.

04:16.041 --> 04:18.375
We are finally going live.

04:18.378 --> 04:20.344
As soon as I give him
this hard drive,

04:20.346 --> 04:21.678
they're going to install
my algorithm

04:21.680 --> 04:22.814
in their system.

04:22.816 --> 04:24.883
In the system?

04:24.885 --> 04:27.151
Congratulations.

04:27.153 --> 04:28.786
When will you be
sending it to them?

04:28.788 --> 04:29.820
The algorithm?

04:29.822 --> 04:31.555
Oh, day after tomorrow.

04:31.557 --> 04:35.692
I still have a little
final tinkering to do.

04:35.694 --> 04:37.795
Have dinner with me
tomorrow night.

04:37.797 --> 04:39.797
We'll celebrate.

04:39.799 --> 04:41.899
Oh, I'd like that.

04:41.901 --> 04:44.668
I promise to tease you
about precautionary principles

04:44.670 --> 04:45.903
all night.

04:45.905 --> 04:47.971
[chuckles]

04:49.607 --> 04:52.476
[overlapping conversations,
phones ringing]

04:57.248 --> 04:59.349
Iris... uh,
Dr. Campbell.

04:59.351 --> 05:01.184
Detective Riley.
Hi.

05:01.186 --> 05:03.153
Hi.

05:03.155 --> 05:05.721
Are you all right?

05:05.723 --> 05:06.856
Sure, you?

05:06.858 --> 05:09.859
Yes. Well--
I just--

05:09.861 --> 05:11.394
I've been wanting to
talk to you, actually,

05:11.396 --> 05:13.763
about our therapy sessions.

05:13.765 --> 05:15.432
Sure.

05:15.434 --> 05:16.866
John, I have to end them.

05:16.868 --> 05:18.167
I'm referring you
to Doug Trujillo.

05:18.169 --> 05:20.837
He's terrific.

05:20.839 --> 05:22.371
[small laugh]

05:22.373 --> 05:24.707
You're firing me as a patient?

05:24.709 --> 05:27.042
Look, does this have to do
with our last session?

05:27.044 --> 05:29.545
You know, I told you about some

05:29.547 --> 05:31.814
violence in my past.

05:31.816 --> 05:33.648
Maybe you were just upset.

05:33.650 --> 05:34.749
Detective, the reasons for this

05:34.751 --> 05:35.750
are not important.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.319
What is important is

05:37.321 --> 05:39.621
that you continue
the work we've started.

05:39.623 --> 05:41.390
Iris...

05:41.392 --> 05:42.591
what aren't you telling me?

05:42.593 --> 05:44.593
Nothing.
I'm sorry, Detective.

05:49.532 --> 05:51.265
Ouch. How many guys?

05:51.267 --> 05:52.834
Oh, it was just the one...

05:52.836 --> 05:55.403
woman.

05:55.405 --> 05:57.372
Also, she stole my badge.

05:57.374 --> 05:59.107
Oh, that's real bad, partner.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.709
They suspend you
for that kind of thing.

06:00.711 --> 06:02.210
So let's go find her.

06:02.212 --> 06:03.545
Frankie Wells.

06:03.547 --> 06:04.880
She may be an alias.

06:04.882 --> 06:06.280
All the information Finch and I

06:06.282 --> 06:07.548
thought we had on her?

06:07.550 --> 06:09.250
Turns out it's all been faked.

06:09.252 --> 06:11.252
Gotta be a pretty good
fake to fool Glasses.

06:11.254 --> 06:12.853
One bright spot though,

06:12.855 --> 06:16.090
she did drop her phone.

06:16.092 --> 06:18.559
(Reese)
This is her boss. Guy goes by Ray.

06:18.561 --> 06:19.894
She tried to kidnap him.

06:19.896 --> 06:21.462
Good surveillance job.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.063
Yeah, and these photos
go back days

06:23.065 --> 06:25.733
before Frankie started
working for Ray.

06:25.735 --> 06:27.401
She's hunting him.

06:27.403 --> 06:30.804
Skilled at surveillance
and she fights like a pro.

06:30.806 --> 06:32.907
(Reese) Could be he's
at one of these places.

06:32.909 --> 06:35.709
Six addresses,
a couple bodegas, a bar.

06:35.711 --> 06:37.144
All sketchy spots.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.211
Where someone with
a badge can get

06:38.213 --> 06:41.248
all the cooperation she needs.

06:41.250 --> 06:43.083
Let's reach out

06:43.085 --> 06:44.651
and see if Detective Riley

06:44.653 --> 06:45.919
has happened by any of them.

06:45.921 --> 06:47.154
(Finch)
John?

06:47.156 --> 06:49.122
Did you text me
a new number earlier?

06:49.124 --> 06:50.790
(Reese)
Yeah, can you handle that?

06:50.792 --> 06:52.592
I'm a little busy right now.

06:52.594 --> 06:54.327
This is very important.
The new number.

06:54.329 --> 06:56.062
When did it come in exactly?

06:56.064 --> 06:58.397
About 9:15 this morning, why?

06:58.399 --> 06:59.465
(Reese)
Finch?

06:59.467 --> 07:01.333
I'll call you later, Mr. Reese.

07:13.613 --> 07:14.880
Detective Riley.

07:14.882 --> 07:16.682
I'm looking for
a girl called Athena.

07:16.684 --> 07:17.916
She's with a guy named Ray.

07:19.118 --> 07:21.887
And I'm looking for my badge.

07:21.889 --> 07:23.289
How the hell did you find me?

07:23.291 --> 07:25.123
Crap!

07:25.125 --> 07:27.993
- Whoa! Hey!
- You're under arrest.

07:27.995 --> 07:30.061
Arrest? Idiot!

07:30.063 --> 07:31.529
I'm after Ray Pratt,

07:31.531 --> 07:33.131
that sleaze ball from
the poker game.

07:33.133 --> 07:35.066
He escaped bail in Florida
on conspiracy charges

07:35.068 --> 07:36.835
and I'm taking him back.

07:36.837 --> 07:38.303
You're a bounty hunter.

07:38.305 --> 07:39.871
Yeah, what'd you think?

07:39.873 --> 07:41.639
Why would Ray Pratt come here?

07:41.641 --> 07:42.908
Because thanks to you,

07:42.910 --> 07:44.809
he knows I'm on to him.

07:44.811 --> 07:46.210
He'll be trying
to leave the country

07:46.212 --> 07:48.546
and for that he needs
falsified papers.

07:48.548 --> 07:51.416
Good ones.

07:51.418 --> 07:53.050
The list on your phone...

07:53.052 --> 07:56.487
Six of the best places
to get counterfeit IDs.

07:56.489 --> 07:58.022
I hear the real expert
is one who works

07:58.024 --> 07:59.190
out of this bar.

07:59.192 --> 08:01.258
Her online handle is Athena.

08:01.260 --> 08:03.393
She's gotta be
around here somewhere.

08:03.395 --> 08:05.196
You two need a room?

08:05.198 --> 08:06.697
(Reese and Frankie)
Shut up!

08:07.933 --> 08:09.366
(Frankie)
Ray!

08:15.273 --> 08:18.041
Ray!

[car horn]

08:19.611 --> 08:20.677
[whistles]

08:20.679 --> 08:21.945
Hey, get in!

08:21.947 --> 08:24.881
Athena?

08:24.883 --> 08:26.850
Hey, Riley!

08:31.556 --> 08:33.289
You know her?

08:33.291 --> 08:35.424
Yeah... and her name's
not Athena.

08:35.426 --> 08:36.893
Come on.

08:49.464 --> 08:53.133
So, Athena's real name
is Harper Rose?

08:53.135 --> 08:54.367
Not exactly.

08:54.369 --> 08:55.735
Harper is not really her name.

08:55.737 --> 08:57.337
We just call her that.

08:57.339 --> 08:58.838
She, uh,

08:58.840 --> 09:00.072
likes the sound of it.

09:00.074 --> 09:01.507
Likes the sound of it?

09:01.509 --> 09:04.544
Are you impaired, Johnny?

09:04.546 --> 09:06.212
I like you.

09:06.214 --> 09:07.913
But you're the one who
needs to answer questions.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.415
And prove who you are.

09:09.417 --> 09:11.750
Bail contract's in my pocket.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.396
Ray Pratt, skipped bail
three months ago.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.431
Charged with conspiracy to
commit various crimes

09:26.433 --> 09:29.100
with one
Carlton I. Worthy.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.736
Worthy's a casino mogul

09:30.738 --> 09:32.838
who's into gambling
and prostitution.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.038
Ray Pratt ran all of
his operations.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.174
But Pratt got caught.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.777
He's due in Broward County
court by Wednesday.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.044
Or, his bail is forfeit

09:40.046 --> 09:41.913
and I owe the court
a million bucks.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.915
I don't have
a million bucks, gentlemen.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.617
I'll lose everything.
I'll go broke.

09:50.122 --> 09:53.091
Now I'm gonna have
to start all over

09:53.093 --> 09:54.625
and track down
this Harper chick.

09:54.627 --> 09:55.793
I'll see you later.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.128
Hold up.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.197
I'm not letting you
go out there alone.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.632
We have reason to believe
that your life's in danger.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.367
Danger.
Oh, jeez.

10:03.369 --> 10:04.635
Whatever will I do?

10:04.637 --> 10:05.936
I'll put you in a cell.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.805
Ha! You'll try.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.741
I am the best hope you have
of finding Harper.

10:23.087 --> 10:24.854
Usually, you're the one
sneaking up on me.

10:26.624 --> 10:28.725
I'm surprised you
called, Harry.

10:28.727 --> 10:30.460
What's up?

10:30.462 --> 10:31.728
[whimper]

10:31.730 --> 10:33.730
(Root)
Elizabeth Bridges.

10:33.732 --> 10:34.931
She looks nice.

10:34.933 --> 10:36.232
My breakfast companion.

10:36.234 --> 10:38.000
Her number came up.

10:38.002 --> 10:40.169
At the moment I
sat down with her.

10:40.171 --> 10:43.306
You triggered it somehow.

10:43.308 --> 10:44.607
Ruh-roh!

10:44.609 --> 10:45.642
Do you think it's possible that

10:45.644 --> 10:47.444
the threat could be Samaritan?

10:47.446 --> 10:48.912
No.

10:48.914 --> 10:51.747
'Cause if it were,
you'd be dead.

10:51.749 --> 10:53.816
I can't protect
Ms. Bridges alone.

10:53.818 --> 10:55.651
I need your help.

10:55.653 --> 10:57.954
Anything you're not telling me?

10:57.956 --> 10:58.988
Of course not.

10:58.990 --> 11:01.490
So will you assist me or not?

11:01.492 --> 11:04.327
You know I'd do
anything for you, Harold.

11:04.329 --> 11:06.094
Anything.

11:08.965 --> 11:11.533
(Reese) She goes by Harper
Rose or maybe Fiona Dubois.

11:11.535 --> 11:13.602
Anything?

11:13.604 --> 11:16.538
No recent arrests.

11:16.540 --> 11:18.273
Well, thanks anyway.

11:18.275 --> 11:19.708
Yeah, I owe you one.

11:21.978 --> 11:23.611
Detective...

11:23.613 --> 11:26.114
I didn't see you there.

11:28.784 --> 11:30.651
John...

11:34.056 --> 11:35.457
Who's the ginger?

11:35.459 --> 11:36.791
Nobody.

11:36.793 --> 11:38.726
And no luck with Harper.
Sorry.

11:38.728 --> 11:40.060
Nobody's seen her.

11:40.062 --> 11:42.029
How'd you meet?

11:42.031 --> 11:44.331
She stole medical
marijuana cash.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.333
Pissed off one of the cartels.

11:46.335 --> 11:48.002
(Frankie)
So Harper's got game?

11:48.004 --> 11:50.872
Harper, Athena, Fiona...

11:50.874 --> 11:53.708
She's got dozens of identities.

11:53.710 --> 11:56.477
A different scam
for every name.

11:56.479 --> 11:58.712
It's tough to chase
someone like that.

11:58.714 --> 12:00.881
I need data.

12:00.883 --> 12:03.317
What else do you
know about her?

12:11.859 --> 12:13.226
Come a long way since our first

12:13.228 --> 12:15.194
field trip together,
haven't we?

12:15.196 --> 12:17.230
When you kidnapped me
and killed two people?

12:17.232 --> 12:18.899
A bit.

12:18.901 --> 12:20.667
Even then, I was in awe of you.

12:20.669 --> 12:23.837
The man who created God.

12:23.839 --> 12:25.071
I never thought...

12:25.073 --> 12:27.040
What?

12:27.042 --> 12:29.542
That we'd be friends.

12:31.045 --> 12:32.378
I can't imagine what
the world would be like

12:32.380 --> 12:34.047
without you.

12:34.049 --> 12:36.949
What I would be like.

12:36.951 --> 12:38.284
I'll go bluejack her phone.

12:38.286 --> 12:40.253
No, no! Too risky!

12:40.255 --> 12:42.088
I've learned that
Ms. Bridges' research

12:42.090 --> 12:44.690
has attracted the interest
of other parties.

12:44.692 --> 12:46.559
Like Greer.

12:50.897 --> 12:52.731
Flag on the play, Harold.

12:52.733 --> 12:55.067
She's in business with
Samaritan's sock puppet?

12:55.069 --> 12:56.635
An unfortunate coincidence.

12:56.637 --> 12:58.537
That you neglected to mention.

12:58.539 --> 13:01.073
You yourself said
our foe was irrelevant here.

13:01.075 --> 13:04.076
[cell phone rings]

13:04.078 --> 13:07.079
- Yes?
- Hi, Harold.

13:07.081 --> 13:08.813
Tomorrow night. How do
you feel about trying

13:08.815 --> 13:10.648
this new sushi place
in the Village?

13:12.552 --> 13:14.752
That's-- that'll
be fine, Beth.

13:14.754 --> 13:15.887
Pick you up at 8.

13:15.889 --> 13:17.189
Bye.

13:19.224 --> 13:21.358
You like her.

13:23.796 --> 13:26.297
(Beth) Hey, what are you doing here?
What, are you following me?

13:26.299 --> 13:28.399
Please, I just wanted to talk.

13:28.401 --> 13:30.568
We may have found
our threat, Harold.

13:30.570 --> 13:31.669
[overlapping argument]

13:31.671 --> 13:33.270
You should go.

13:33.272 --> 13:35.106
Absolutely not.

13:35.108 --> 13:36.740
What is she sees you?
I'll get close

13:36.742 --> 13:39.743
to listen and report back.

13:39.745 --> 13:43.847
Don't worry.
I've got this.

13:47.752 --> 13:49.253
[techno club music]

13:49.255 --> 13:51.755
Hey, hey!
Anybody seen Isabel?

13:51.757 --> 13:52.956
I heard she has bottle service

13:52.958 --> 13:54.758
with a dozen hedge fund dweebs.

13:54.760 --> 13:55.792
Opportunity knocks.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.360
Hi, Fiona.

13:57.362 --> 14:00.196
Isabel couldn't
make it after all.

14:00.198 --> 14:01.798
Out!

14:01.800 --> 14:03.867
Good night!

14:03.869 --> 14:05.502
Hello, Harper.

14:05.504 --> 14:07.037
Where's Ray Pratt?

14:07.039 --> 14:08.338
No idea.

14:08.340 --> 14:09.339
I told him to hide out

14:09.341 --> 14:10.773
and not tell me where.

14:10.775 --> 14:14.177
Until you have his ID ready?

14:14.179 --> 14:16.312
The high end fakes take time.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.515
You gotta pay off DMV guys.

14:18.517 --> 14:20.216
Maybe even someone
at the Post Office

14:20.218 --> 14:22.652
regarding passports.

14:22.654 --> 14:23.986
When Ray gets his ID,

14:23.988 --> 14:25.387
he'll flee
the country for good.

14:25.389 --> 14:27.790
Little girl, believe me
when I say,

14:27.792 --> 14:29.358
I won't let that happen.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.127
It's just business.

14:31.129 --> 14:32.394
Why don't you guys
chase that, uh,

14:32.396 --> 14:34.030
Carlton Worthy dude.

14:34.032 --> 14:35.631
That sounds more challenging.

14:35.633 --> 14:36.899
Harper, you will tell us

14:36.901 --> 14:39.334
where Ray Pratt is
or I will arrest you.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.869
For what?

14:40.871 --> 14:42.404
I saw a crazy bitch chasing Ray

14:42.406 --> 14:43.405
so I saved him.

14:43.407 --> 14:44.573
Do you wanna go? Really?

14:44.575 --> 14:45.641
Stop.

14:45.643 --> 14:47.643
We're leaving.

14:47.645 --> 14:49.244
Say good night, Frankie.

14:49.246 --> 14:51.146
- What the hell?
- Trust me.

14:56.419 --> 14:59.087
(Root) And then, Beth
turned in for the night.

14:59.089 --> 15:00.889
And that man?

15:00.891 --> 15:02.356
He left right after you did.

15:02.358 --> 15:03.825
I took photos.

15:03.827 --> 15:05.994
Lionel promised to
help run them tomorrow.

I do love surveillance.

15:11.167 --> 15:14.202
Oh, dear.

Harold...

15:16.706 --> 15:19.340
what's going on?

15:25.947 --> 15:28.416
Harper has to give Ray
the fake papers.

15:28.418 --> 15:30.718
Eventually.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.285
Once she does,
we'll be following.

15:33.621 --> 15:36.790
You should have let me
kick her narrow ass.

15:36.792 --> 15:38.325
God, I hate pantyhose.

15:43.698 --> 15:45.365
Thanks.

15:45.367 --> 15:47.967
I bluejacked
two of Harper's phones.

15:47.969 --> 15:49.603
I couldn't pair
the third, though.

15:49.605 --> 15:51.871
That's 'cause I
bluejacked it first.

Hey, she's making a call.

15:56.211 --> 15:57.310
(Harper)
Dash, it's Athena.

15:57.312 --> 15:58.645
Have the papers ready.

15:58.647 --> 15:59.879
We're heading to
your location now.

15:59.881 --> 16:00.947
Me and my client.

16:00.949 --> 16:03.049
Harper has Ray with her.

16:03.051 --> 16:04.550
She lied.

16:04.552 --> 16:06.919
Go figure.

16:06.921 --> 16:08.587

There she is.

Go, go, go.

16:17.731 --> 16:19.232

Where the hell is she going?

16:19.234 --> 16:21.400
Just stay back and be patient.

16:21.402 --> 16:23.135
Why? We know Ray's there.

16:23.137 --> 16:24.936
Watch and learn, Johnny.

16:26.773 --> 16:28.073
Look out.

16:35.115 --> 16:36.314
Stay here.

16:36.316 --> 16:41.519
Yeah, right.

16:41.521 --> 16:43.488
- Don't shoot!
- Pratt's not here.

16:43.490 --> 16:45.290
She told me I could
have the car!

- [gun shot]
- Aah!

16:57.170 --> 16:58.703

Not bad.

16:58.705 --> 16:59.870

How you doing?

17:45.079 --> 17:46.979
Oh, good, you're up!

17:46.981 --> 17:49.481
It's a shame Ray wasn't
in that car, Ms. Wells.

17:49.483 --> 17:51.316
Here I was following you
all day

17:51.318 --> 17:53.519
and you let
that girl Athena trick you.

Where's my boy, Ray?

17:59.460 --> 18:01.960
How the hell should I know?

18:01.962 --> 18:04.630
You want him so bad,
you'd risk kidnapping a cop?

18:04.632 --> 18:06.498
Ray stole from me.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.534
$100,000.

18:08.536 --> 18:12.336
Can you imagine? There's
just no integrity anymore.

18:12.338 --> 18:13.638
And I don't want to
live in a world

18:13.640 --> 18:14.673
with no integrity.

18:14.675 --> 18:16.007
Do you, Ms. Wells?

18:16.009 --> 18:18.309
You should let her go.
Now.

18:18.311 --> 18:20.545
(Carlton) Someone like you
always has another lead.

18:20.547 --> 18:22.346
Something in your back pocket.

18:22.348 --> 18:23.882
Ray Pratt, where is he?

18:23.884 --> 18:25.316
I-- I don't know,
Mr. Worthy.

18:25.318 --> 18:26.450
I-- I swear.

18:26.452 --> 18:30.020
You're lying to me,
Ms. Wells.

18:30.022 --> 18:33.123
You've got ten minutes
to change her mind, Detective.

18:33.125 --> 18:35.726
Then this gentlemen
will kill you both.

18:43.202 --> 18:45.635
(Root) Your office break-in, Harold.
Tell me the truth.

18:45.637 --> 18:47.905
I worry that the break-in
may be related to

18:47.907 --> 18:50.908
a side project of mine.

18:50.910 --> 18:53.010
I knew that Samaritan
would become interested

18:53.012 --> 18:54.344
in Beth's research.

18:54.346 --> 18:56.847
So, in Hong Kong,

18:56.849 --> 19:00.517
I gained access
to her computer.

19:00.519 --> 19:02.051
And installed something.

19:02.053 --> 19:04.421
I built a narrow AI,

19:04.423 --> 19:06.189
one that could provide
a backdoor

19:06.191 --> 19:08.692
into our enemy itself,

19:08.694 --> 19:12.061
transmitting data
from the inside.

19:12.063 --> 19:14.264
You used her algorithm
as a Trojan Horse,

19:14.266 --> 19:17.166
hoping it would eventually
be installed in Samaritan.

19:17.168 --> 19:19.068
Ms. Groves,
I was right.

19:19.070 --> 19:22.905
It will be installed
mere days from now.

19:22.907 --> 19:25.341
I've left
the Trojan Horse dormant

19:25.343 --> 19:27.110
to avoid discovery.

19:27.112 --> 19:28.677
This activates it.

19:28.679 --> 19:30.346
I just need to get it
close to her laptop,

19:30.348 --> 19:32.081
which I'll do tonight
at dinner.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.082
Harold...

19:33.084 --> 19:34.683
It can only transmit

19:34.685 --> 19:36.585
a tiny amount of data.

19:36.587 --> 19:38.254
Maybe a few megs.

19:38.256 --> 19:41.690
But it's data from
Samaritan's core heuristics.

19:41.692 --> 19:42.891
It-- it's DNA.

19:42.893 --> 19:44.126
You may be able to find a way

19:44.128 --> 19:45.694
to cripple it.

19:45.696 --> 19:48.397
The program can only
be used once.

19:48.399 --> 19:50.132
Our enemy will trace
the data stream

19:50.134 --> 19:51.699
and try to destroy

19:51.701 --> 19:53.601
whoever is wielding the device.

19:53.603 --> 19:56.537
But it could make
a difference in this war.

19:56.539 --> 20:00.142
Dangerous and bold.

20:00.144 --> 20:01.977
That's my Harry.

20:01.979 --> 20:04.579
But breaking in to my office...

20:04.581 --> 20:06.414
how is that related?

20:06.416 --> 20:07.649
(Root)
Maybe it's not.

20:07.651 --> 20:09.617
What's your problem?

20:09.619 --> 20:11.051
Wilfred, our marriage is over.
I don't want to see you again.

20:11.053 --> 20:12.287
For God's sake,
go back to London

20:12.289 --> 20:15.657
and stop embarrassing yourself.

20:15.659 --> 20:18.593
I see why you like her, Harry.

20:18.595 --> 20:21.128
This is all good news.

20:21.130 --> 20:23.630
Clearly the himbo
trashed your office.

20:23.632 --> 20:26.901
A jealous ex, it's classic.

20:26.903 --> 20:28.235
Beth's number came up because

20:28.237 --> 20:29.736
he was watching the two of you

20:29.738 --> 20:31.305
have coffee.

20:31.307 --> 20:32.739
Perhaps you're right.

20:32.741 --> 20:34.441
JFK airport,

20:34.443 --> 20:36.510
extra 50 if you
break every speed limit.

20:37.578 --> 20:39.446
Well,

20:39.448 --> 20:42.349
my work here is done.

20:42.351 --> 20:43.817
I should go.

20:43.819 --> 20:45.786
Is there a problem?

20:45.788 --> 20:47.954
Can I help?

20:47.956 --> 20:51.024
You're a good friend, Harold.

20:51.026 --> 20:53.560
But this one
I have to do alone.

21:02.669 --> 21:04.871
(man) Come on, Lee.
Go get the hacksaw.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.841
You might wanna work faster.

21:07.843 --> 21:10.877
(Frankie)
The blade's too big.

21:10.879 --> 21:12.545
Deke, you let me down.

21:16.182 --> 21:17.850
You name your knives?

21:17.852 --> 21:19.352
No, Deacon's my big brother.

21:19.354 --> 21:21.220
He gave it to me.

21:21.222 --> 21:23.622
He in Florida?

21:23.624 --> 21:25.023
He's dead.

21:25.025 --> 21:26.792
A mugging gone wrong.

21:26.794 --> 21:29.294
Help me find a paperclip
or something, will you?

21:29.296 --> 21:31.663
Growing up, we were
no-shoes-poor.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.465
Kids made fun of us.

21:33.467 --> 21:35.968
This kid Joe used to
beat me up every damn day

21:35.970 --> 21:39.671
until Deacon broke Joe's arm.

21:42.708 --> 21:46.978
He said, "Some people
need to be made truly sorry."

21:46.980 --> 21:49.180
That's why I like skip tracing.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.515
To catch people who did wrong

21:50.517 --> 21:52.751
and make them truly sorry.

21:55.254 --> 21:56.254
Got it!

21:56.256 --> 21:58.456
They're coming.

22:02.694 --> 22:10.634
[fighting efforts]

22:20.044 --> 22:21.678
- Not bad!
- I know.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.113
[chuckles]

22:25.383 --> 22:28.184
[thugs grunt]

22:28.186 --> 22:32.055
What is it with you
and me and handcuffs?

22:37.128 --> 22:39.095
[groans]

22:39.097 --> 22:42.098
Frankie!

22:42.100 --> 22:45.768
Come on.

22:45.770 --> 22:47.203
Worthy was right.

22:47.205 --> 22:48.638
I am a liar.

22:48.640 --> 22:51.741
And I'll have to
catch Ray myself.

22:51.743 --> 22:53.709
I'm sorry, John.

23:22.137 --> 23:24.405
This is Beth's room, Harold.

23:24.407 --> 23:27.008
Why are you here?

23:27.010 --> 23:30.345
I was concerned,
Ms. Groves, you seemed...

23:30.347 --> 23:31.980
Why are you here?

23:31.982 --> 23:33.914
I just wanted to make sure
we were right about

23:33.916 --> 23:37.118
her ex-husband being the threat.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.919
You should probably
high-tail it.

23:38.921 --> 23:42.256
Beth could come back
at any minute.

23:42.258 --> 23:44.558
Really, Harold.
You should go.

23:48.597 --> 23:51.632
Ms. Groves...
Root...

23:51.634 --> 23:54.702
The threat to Beth's life...

23:54.704 --> 24:00.640
Is it you?

24:00.642 --> 24:03.110
Yes, Harold.

24:03.112 --> 24:05.078
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to kill her.

24:18.229 --> 24:20.229
We have to find Ray.
That's where Frankie is.

24:20.231 --> 24:21.730
I got an idea on that.

24:21.732 --> 24:23.031
Before Ray Pratt
moved to Florida,

24:23.033 --> 24:24.565
he worked for his uncle here.

24:24.567 --> 24:26.868
A dry-dock business
down the shore.

24:26.870 --> 24:29.671
Seasonal business,
so it's closed now.

24:29.673 --> 24:31.272
Perfect place to hide.

24:31.274 --> 24:32.907
That's Frankie's lead.

24:32.909 --> 24:34.709
And partner,
we need to move quick.

24:34.711 --> 24:35.777
The cops in Florida
just have Pratt

24:35.779 --> 24:37.345
on their conspiracy racket.

24:37.347 --> 24:41.115
But I have reason to think
he's a killer.

24:41.117 --> 24:43.851
I was looking into
Worthy's hotels down in Florida.

24:43.853 --> 24:45.085
Last year, a couple of months

24:45.087 --> 24:46.554
before Ray got arrested,

24:46.556 --> 24:48.256
his accountant
got his throat slashed.

24:48.258 --> 24:49.257
Brutal work.

24:49.259 --> 24:51.559
Cops said it was a mugging.

24:51.561 --> 24:53.561
No one connected Ray
to the death.

24:53.563 --> 24:54.595
But you did.

24:54.597 --> 24:55.630
Ray was his boss.

24:55.632 --> 24:57.131
Argued with him.
The next day,

24:57.133 --> 24:58.265
the accountant ended up
in an alley

24:58.267 --> 25:00.134
with his throat slashed.

25:00.136 --> 25:01.969
Frankie could be in trouble.

25:01.971 --> 25:03.971
And Harper!

25:14.382 --> 25:16.149
Hello?

25:20.054 --> 25:22.289
Hey, Pratt!

25:22.291 --> 25:25.725
Hey, gorgeous.

25:25.727 --> 25:28.295
You got 'em?

25:28.297 --> 25:30.063
DL, passport,
birth certificate,

25:30.065 --> 25:31.097
and a ticket to Brazil.

25:31.099 --> 25:33.566
You leave at 5:00.

25:33.568 --> 25:36.869
Come on up.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.681
You followed me to
coffee with Beth.

25:48.683 --> 25:49.781
It was you watching us,

25:49.783 --> 25:51.917
not her ex-husband.

25:51.919 --> 25:54.119
- And my office?
- Trashed it.

25:54.121 --> 25:56.255
I was looking for
that activation device.

25:57.424 --> 25:58.924
So you knew before I told you

25:58.926 --> 26:00.292
what my plan was?

26:00.294 --> 26:03.762
I knew enough.
You told me the rest.

26:03.764 --> 26:06.131
Only you would have
the audacity, Harold.

26:06.133 --> 26:08.967
Sneaking past Zeus
to steal fire.

26:08.969 --> 26:11.203
But inevitably,
you'll be discovered.

26:11.205 --> 26:12.838
Samaritan will link
Harold Whistler with

26:12.840 --> 26:14.439
Beth Bridges and minutes later,

26:14.441 --> 26:15.673
it will murder you.

26:15.675 --> 26:16.708
All because you'll
see her tonight

26:16.710 --> 26:18.710
and activate that program.

26:20.979 --> 26:23.013
She's gonna get
you killed, Harold.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.649
That's why she has to die.

26:27.018 --> 26:29.220
Please, you mustn't
do this, Ms. Groves.

26:30.889 --> 26:32.323
It's a neurotoxin.

26:32.325 --> 26:35.359
Untraceable.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.061
I promise,

26:37.063 --> 26:39.163
I'll make sure
her death is painless.

26:43.735 --> 26:45.069
Yeah, Fusco?

26:45.071 --> 26:46.470
(Fusco)
No luck finding Harper.

26:46.472 --> 26:47.838
And I haven't found out
anything more

26:47.840 --> 26:49.807
about the dead accountant,
Deacon Sanders.

26:49.809 --> 26:50.808
(Reese)
Hang on.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.743
Deacon...

26:52.745 --> 26:54.010
The accountant's name
is Deacon?

26:54.012 --> 26:55.412
Stupid name, right?

26:55.414 --> 26:57.381
Who died in
an apparent mugging.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.716
(Reese) Damn it. None of
this is what we thought.

26:59.718 --> 27:02.185
Ray isn't the perp here.

27:02.187 --> 27:03.920
Fusco,

27:03.922 --> 27:05.355
I need you to look into

27:05.357 --> 27:06.690
Deacon Sanders' family
in Florida.

27:06.692 --> 27:07.957
And do it now.

27:10.394 --> 27:12.262
Nice doing business.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.430
That'll be 50 large.

27:14.432 --> 27:16.199
Got something better.

27:16.201 --> 27:17.834
My insurance against Worthy.

27:17.836 --> 27:20.736
Every illegal transaction
for the past two years.

27:20.738 --> 27:22.405
Names and numbers.

27:22.407 --> 27:24.473
I'm cash and carry, babe.

27:27.744 --> 27:30.780
Take it or leave it.

27:37.454 --> 27:39.288
(Frankie)
Hi, Ray.

27:39.290 --> 27:40.889
You should go.

27:45.261 --> 27:47.196
(Harper)
Watch your back, Barbie.

27:47.198 --> 27:49.597
Ray's a sociopath.

27:49.599 --> 27:51.399
I know.

27:51.401 --> 27:53.936
- [pistol whip]
- [groan]

27:53.938 --> 27:56.038
[gun cocks]
Say good-bye, Ray.

27:59.408 --> 28:02.076
Harold, this is
chloral hydrate.

28:02.078 --> 28:03.244
I'm going to put you out.

28:03.246 --> 28:04.813
Making you watch would
just be cruel.

28:04.815 --> 28:07.549
Don't do this.

28:07.551 --> 28:11.319
Please, Ms. Groves.

28:11.321 --> 28:16.457
But Beth should be back by now.

28:16.459 --> 28:18.092
I bet she stopped at Veniero's.

28:18.094 --> 28:19.827
She loves their cannoli.

28:19.829 --> 28:21.428
Why kill her?

28:21.430 --> 28:23.597
Why didn't you just
tell me not to see her?

28:23.599 --> 28:26.433
I knew you'd never stop.

28:26.435 --> 28:30.137
This plan of yours
means too much to you.

28:30.139 --> 28:31.739
No, it's--
it's better to

28:31.741 --> 28:34.641
let Beth die of a heart attack.

28:34.643 --> 28:35.976
Enough.

28:35.978 --> 28:37.444
This won't hurt.
I promise.

28:37.446 --> 28:38.912
My plan does mean too much.

28:38.914 --> 28:41.615
Too much to kill her.

28:41.617 --> 28:44.651
If you do,
my program will fail.

28:44.653 --> 28:45.819
This could be a real weapon.

28:45.821 --> 28:47.153
It's worth risking my life.

28:47.155 --> 28:48.821
No.

28:48.823 --> 28:50.290
You're too important.

28:50.292 --> 28:51.858
My value to
the Machine is irrelevant.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.793
You're too important to me!

28:58.832 --> 29:01.768
The Machine didn't
tell you to do this.

29:01.770 --> 29:04.704
She told me not to.

29:07.641 --> 29:09.809
I-- I thought
I could sacrifice everyone.

29:09.811 --> 29:12.712
I-- I really did.

29:12.714 --> 29:14.814
Win some, lose some, right?

29:14.816 --> 29:16.148
It's for a good cause.

29:16.150 --> 29:20.152
But...

29:20.154 --> 29:24.623
But it turns out,
I can't lose you, Harold.

29:24.625 --> 29:26.124
Not you and Shaw.

29:28.828 --> 29:30.829
So you will kill
this woman to save my life?

29:33.866 --> 29:35.801
It will all be over very soon.

29:37.570 --> 29:39.504
No!
Harold!

29:44.810 --> 29:46.510
There's no need to kill her

29:46.512 --> 29:49.447
if I'm already dead.

29:52.884 --> 29:55.486
I'm Frankie Wells,
your new bail bondsman.

29:55.488 --> 29:57.822
I have a license
to hunt you down.

29:57.824 --> 30:01.391
Contract says I have to
get you to court by Wednesday.

30:01.393 --> 30:05.563
Doesn't say I have to
get you there alive.

30:05.565 --> 30:07.097
[gun shot]

30:09.835 --> 30:12.603
He shot at me,
I fired back in self-defense.

30:14.506 --> 30:16.273
And why is it you want me dead?

30:16.275 --> 30:18.775
(Reese)
Because you killed her brother.

30:18.777 --> 30:21.011
Deacon Sanders.

30:21.013 --> 30:23.613
The accountant at
Worthy's hotel in Florida.

30:25.383 --> 30:28.118
Hi, Johnny.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.287
Hi, Frankie.

30:30.289 --> 30:32.589
After you got arrested,
I realized the "mugging"

30:32.591 --> 30:35.091
had to be you.

30:35.093 --> 30:38.461
Deacon found out that
you were stealing from Worthy.

30:38.463 --> 30:41.430
Idiot came at me with
questions about the books.

30:41.432 --> 30:43.766
Said he wanted to
do the right thing.

30:43.768 --> 30:45.267
I was putting together
a murder case

30:45.269 --> 30:47.370
to take to the cops
when you skipped.

30:47.372 --> 30:49.205
That's when I realized

30:49.207 --> 30:52.308
I had to handle this myself.

30:52.310 --> 30:56.745
Ordinarily I'd ask if
you were sorry now.

30:56.747 --> 31:01.817
Truly sorry that you
killed my brother.

31:01.819 --> 31:03.952
But I know better now.

31:03.954 --> 31:08.123
A sociopath can't be sorry.

31:08.125 --> 31:11.059
So I guess I'm going to have to
be sorry for both of us.

31:11.061 --> 31:12.494
Frankie...

31:15.798 --> 31:17.232
[intense music]

31:17.234 --> 31:18.834
No!

31:18.836 --> 31:20.969
(Reese)
Harper!

31:20.971 --> 31:23.671
All right!

31:23.673 --> 31:25.407
Well ain't this
a hell of a thing?

31:37.364 --> 31:38.697
[Harper struggles]

31:38.699 --> 31:40.032
(Reese)
Ray, let her go!

31:40.034 --> 31:41.233
You should listen to him.

31:41.235 --> 31:49.175
[gun shots]

31:53.212 --> 31:55.180
- [automatic weapon firing shots]
- What the hell?

31:55.182 --> 31:59.250
[gunfire]

31:59.252 --> 32:01.186
Ray!

32:01.188 --> 32:02.888
I told you there'd be
a reckoning!

32:02.890 --> 32:04.456
[gunfire]

32:07.559 --> 32:10.195
You disappoint me, Harold.

32:10.197 --> 32:11.596
How long do I have?

32:11.598 --> 32:13.865
Hi. My friend
needs to get to the hospital

32:13.867 --> 32:16.267
in 11 minutes or he's dead.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.839
I won't go.

32:21.841 --> 32:24.274
When they come, I won't go.

32:24.276 --> 32:27.645
And legally, they can't
force me.

32:31.049 --> 32:39.056
[gunfire]

32:39.058 --> 32:40.524
Ah!

32:40.526 --> 32:41.691
Worthy doesn't care if the girl

32:41.693 --> 32:42.859
gets caught in the crossfire.

32:42.861 --> 32:46.230
[gunfire]

32:46.232 --> 32:48.399
Hey-- [stammers] I got this!

32:48.401 --> 32:50.401
You want to get out
of here alive, Pratt?

32:50.403 --> 32:52.403
Careful.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.971
[gunfire]

32:54.973 --> 32:56.907
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

32:58.976 --> 33:02.278
Everybody ready to make a deal?

33:02.280 --> 33:04.080
- A deal?
- That's right.

33:04.082 --> 33:05.415
You want Ray dead.

33:05.417 --> 33:10.053
But what you need
is your freedom.

33:10.055 --> 33:12.255
This is Ray's insurance policy
against you.

33:12.257 --> 33:14.723
Put you in prison for ten years.

33:14.725 --> 33:15.758
What if I give it to you

33:15.760 --> 33:17.826
and you get to walk out of here?

33:17.828 --> 33:20.063
I'm listening.

33:20.065 --> 33:22.131
You wanna go to Brazil,
but believe me,

33:22.133 --> 33:23.499
that ain't happening.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.000
What's happening in
the next ten minutes

33:25.002 --> 33:27.103
is you'll either be dead
or under arrest.

33:27.105 --> 33:31.273
You get to pick.

33:31.275 --> 33:33.642
And Detective Riley?
You want to arrest

33:33.644 --> 33:35.177
Pratt and Worthy.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.812
But you are gonna take
Ray alone

33:36.814 --> 33:38.180
and let Worthy go.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.115
He hasn't killed anybody...

33:40.117 --> 33:42.217
that we know of.

33:46.755 --> 33:49.458
Worthy can walk out of here.

33:49.460 --> 33:52.327
So...

33:52.329 --> 33:54.262
just one more piece
of the deal.

33:58.434 --> 34:00.268
Okay, Frankie.

34:00.270 --> 34:02.270
You want Pratt dead.

34:02.272 --> 34:04.706
And you've got good reason.

34:04.708 --> 34:07.642
But he's gonna go to jail
for a long, long time.

34:07.644 --> 34:09.510
So...

34:09.512 --> 34:11.545
no killing.

34:11.547 --> 34:12.847
No.

34:12.849 --> 34:16.117
Yes.

34:16.119 --> 34:19.453
To save the girl's life.

34:19.455 --> 34:21.822
I know it's not what you want,

34:21.824 --> 34:24.492
but it's what
I'm asking of you.

34:30.632 --> 34:32.333
All right!

34:38.873 --> 34:40.841
Nice doing business with you.

34:46.347 --> 34:47.580
I'm not going to jail!

34:47.581 --> 34:49.349
[gun shot]

34:49.351 --> 34:51.083
[cry of pain]

34:54.888 --> 34:56.822
I said don't kill him.

35:00.561 --> 35:03.196
(Root)
Harold, stop this now!

35:03.198 --> 35:06.766
If I'm dead,
you won't kill her.

35:06.768 --> 35:08.601
There won't be a need.

35:08.603 --> 35:13.105
Do you really care
that much about this woman?

35:13.107 --> 35:16.175
If she dies, it's my fault.

35:16.177 --> 35:18.744
And I will not be responsible

35:18.746 --> 35:22.347
for one more friend's death.

35:22.349 --> 35:25.417
Shaw's not your fault.

35:25.419 --> 35:28.554
Even if she does turn up dead,

35:28.556 --> 35:32.624
it's not your fault.

35:32.626 --> 35:34.926
I asked her to
help us that day.

35:34.928 --> 35:38.297
I did, Harold!

35:38.299 --> 35:39.964
I suppose we're both

35:39.966 --> 35:44.002
just trying to save
one more friend from dying.

35:48.307 --> 35:49.707
You win!

35:49.709 --> 35:50.941
I-- I won't kill her.

35:50.943 --> 35:52.042
I give you my word, Harold.

35:52.044 --> 35:53.077
Beth will live.

35:53.079 --> 35:55.313
Please.

35:55.315 --> 35:58.649
Please, please believe me.

35:58.651 --> 36:01.719
All right, I believe you.

36:01.721 --> 36:04.554
Root...

36:04.556 --> 36:07.057
Okay...
Come on...

36:10.128 --> 36:13.230
[elevator dings]

36:13.232 --> 36:17.500
[other elevator dings]

36:17.502 --> 36:19.002
Have a good day.

36:26.877 --> 36:28.377
Give it.

36:28.379 --> 36:30.613
The real thumb drive.

36:30.615 --> 36:31.981
There's no way you'd
strike a bargain

36:31.983 --> 36:34.016
where you weren't
the big winner.

36:34.018 --> 36:35.552
It's mine.

36:35.554 --> 36:36.820
Fair and square.

36:36.822 --> 36:38.454
It's worth some serious coin.

36:38.456 --> 36:40.789
How'd you get in touch
with Ray in the first place?

36:40.791 --> 36:43.359
Actually, I thought I had
you and Harold to thank.

36:43.361 --> 36:44.994
Right after the thing
with the cartel,

36:44.996 --> 36:46.562
this guy reached out to me.

36:46.564 --> 36:48.630
Highly encrypted texts
and every one

36:48.632 --> 36:50.632
a great opportunity.

36:50.634 --> 36:52.368
Real rich deals.

36:52.370 --> 36:53.735
You know, probably
made ten grand

36:53.737 --> 36:55.303
off of Thornhill, easy.

36:55.305 --> 36:57.539
Thornhill?

36:57.541 --> 36:59.641
That's the alias of
an acquaintance of mine.

36:59.643 --> 37:00.642
Uh-huh.

37:00.644 --> 37:03.078
So you do know him.

37:03.080 --> 37:07.315
Well, actually,
some say it's a her.

37:07.317 --> 37:09.150
Get outta here.

37:09.152 --> 37:11.486
Yes, sir.

37:14.590 --> 37:16.224
Hey, Harold?

37:16.226 --> 37:17.592
Call me.

37:17.594 --> 37:20.128
Harper is getting texts
from the Machine.

37:29.404 --> 37:31.506
Beth, I got your message
canceling dinner

37:31.508 --> 37:34.041
and thought I'd come by.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.409
May I come in for a moment?

37:35.411 --> 37:36.944
Are you kidding?

37:36.946 --> 37:39.313
No.

37:43.018 --> 37:44.351
"To the editor of the journal

37:44.353 --> 37:46.553
of the International
Mathematical Society..."

37:46.555 --> 37:48.422
It's a letter claiming
I falsified data

37:48.424 --> 37:50.457
on a project I did
five years ago.

37:50.459 --> 37:52.459
The email contains
electronic proof

37:52.461 --> 37:55.562
that it came from
your university account.

37:55.564 --> 37:57.597
A hacker could forge
such proof.

37:57.599 --> 37:59.233
Please!

37:59.235 --> 38:01.434
I know that we disagree
about technology, Harold,

38:01.436 --> 38:03.970
but to do this just to
discredit me--

38:03.972 --> 38:06.940
it's despicable.

38:06.942 --> 38:08.808
Was it all just a fake?

38:08.810 --> 38:11.645
Hong Kong?
Everything?

38:11.647 --> 38:16.016
No.
Not everything.

38:18.818 --> 38:20.886
Good-bye, Harold.

38:23.823 --> 38:26.025
Good-bye.

38:35.969 --> 38:38.804
NYPD picked up Carlton Worthy
and his men

38:38.806 --> 38:41.273
at the GW bridge.

38:41.275 --> 38:42.841
I promised he could
leave the building,

38:42.843 --> 38:44.009
not the state.

38:44.011 --> 38:46.612
You tell 'em, Crockett.

38:46.614 --> 38:48.047
I'm gonna miss you.

38:53.018 --> 38:56.988
So, John, you gonna
lock me up, too?

38:56.990 --> 39:00.492
Maybe next time.

39:00.494 --> 39:05.230
'Cause you know
I got handcuffs.

39:12.471 --> 39:14.472
Call me when you're a free man.

39:22.814 --> 39:24.248
My office.

39:35.893 --> 39:37.961
Detective...

39:37.963 --> 39:42.465
John.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.701
You were right.

39:44.703 --> 39:46.036
I should have been
honest with you

39:46.038 --> 39:48.371
about why I had to
stop our sessions.

39:48.373 --> 39:50.841
I told myself it was
for your protection,

39:50.843 --> 39:54.477
but really I was
just being a coward.

39:54.479 --> 39:57.980
So, just...
tell me.

39:57.982 --> 40:01.151
John, hear me,

40:01.153 --> 40:04.587
it's not because of anything
in your past.

40:04.589 --> 40:07.490
There's nothing you could
tell me in a session

40:07.492 --> 40:10.527
that would make me run.

40:10.529 --> 40:12.028
So you're not afraid of me?

40:12.030 --> 40:15.164
Oh, I am.

40:15.166 --> 40:17.263
Very.

40:20.204 --> 40:23.706
I have feelings for you, John.

40:23.708 --> 40:24.707
Oh...

40:24.709 --> 40:26.008
Which is inappropriate,

40:26.010 --> 40:29.211
wrong, completely unethical.

40:29.213 --> 40:31.380
I can't have a relationship
with even an ex-patient.

40:31.382 --> 40:33.415
It's so wrong, it's like a cop

40:33.417 --> 40:35.184
dating a fireman,
it's that bad.

40:35.186 --> 40:36.718
- Okay.
- And I've tried to stop it

40:36.720 --> 40:38.119
for weeks. I could
lose my job

40:38.121 --> 40:39.688
for God's sake.
The job I love.

40:39.690 --> 40:41.856
And I tried but
I kept finding that

40:41.858 --> 40:46.695
every time I'm with you,
I just feel--

40:46.697 --> 40:48.797
I--

40:48.799 --> 40:50.965
Oh, the hell with it.

41:03.378 --> 41:07.748
Actually...

41:14.155 --> 41:17.191
I'm pretty good
at keeping secrets.

41:40.648 --> 41:42.415
It had to be, Harry.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.618
You hurt a good woman.

41:44.620 --> 41:47.454
Didn't kill her.

41:47.456 --> 41:51.290
And you're alive too,

41:51.292 --> 41:53.259
despite your best efforts.

42:02.202 --> 42:04.303
The activation device,
give it to me.

42:04.305 --> 42:07.839
I can't.
I destroyed it.

42:07.841 --> 42:10.709
Then it was all for nothing.

42:10.711 --> 42:15.447
Months of planning,
Hong Kong, Beth...

42:15.449 --> 42:17.983
The Trojan Horse was important.

42:17.985 --> 42:20.952
It could've given us a chance.

42:25.491 --> 42:29.394
It's okay if we're
not friends anymore.

42:29.396 --> 42:33.265
You being alive is enough.

42:53.352 --> 42:55.687
I don't want to see you
for a while.

43:03.728 --> 43:05.196
Of course.

43:10.101 --> 43:12.536
It was a brilliant
plan, Harold.

43:12.538 --> 43:15.939
The Trojan Horse.

43:15.941 --> 43:18.507
But it would've gotten
Professor Whistler killed.
