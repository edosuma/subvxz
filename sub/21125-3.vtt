WEBVTT

00:06.140 --> 00:08.376
- Here we go, ladies.
Here we go.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.111
Soft hands, light feet.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.612
- Looking good, Panthers.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.547
- You too, Coach.
Very cute.

00:13.647 --> 00:14.582
Cute coaching.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.317
- Okay.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.618
- That's not something
you need to shout about.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.187
- Ah, just feels good to be back

00:19.287 --> 00:20.521
on these old bleachers,
you know.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.490
Watching my man kill it
on the court.

00:22.590 --> 00:26.060
- Let me ask you this, is it
weird to be atop the bleachers

00:26.160 --> 00:27.528
instead of dry-grinding
beneath them?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.363
- You know, I did do some of my
best work down there.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.099
Oh, but I took a peep earlier,

00:31.199 --> 00:32.633
and it's a real Templeton
the Rat situation.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.302
- That's no good.
- All this popcorn.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.603
- Don't want that going up
your you-know-what.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.139
- No, you don't.
Oh, speaking of rats,

00:38.239 --> 00:39.140
I told my mother.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.374
- Yup.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.375
- Yes, sir.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.345
- She said,
"Why are you telling me?"

00:44.445 --> 00:45.813
- That sounds about right.
- Yeah.

00:45.913 --> 00:49.617
- Kick it up strong!
We have to beat Danbury!

00:49.717 --> 00:53.087
- This town takes its ladies
basketball very seriously.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.456
- Yeah, we do, it's
the Pinebrook Invitational.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.126
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- And we keep losing to Danbury,

00:58.226 --> 00:59.327
but not this year, okay?

00:59.427 --> 01:00.561
This year we're
shutting it down,

01:00.661 --> 01:02.163
'cause everyone's
getting involved.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.564
Mark is coaching,
I'm reffing...

01:05.333 --> 01:06.467
What the hell are
you doing here?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.636
And why are you wearing
an elastic pant?

01:08.736 --> 01:10.238
- That's a rather
strong reaction

01:10.338 --> 01:11.605
to a woman taking a light jog.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.141
I'm here to play.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.409
You realize it's a sport.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.577
You have to run.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.546
- It's all part
of my Gwennaissance.

01:18.646 --> 01:19.847
- Oh, God.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.416
- A transformation
of the mind and body.

01:22.516 --> 01:23.417
- Oh!

01:23.517 --> 01:24.418
- Yes.
- Nice.

01:24.518 --> 01:25.586
- Mark! Alley-oop!

01:27.788 --> 01:29.223
- Nice.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.324
Have to win it

01:30.424 --> 01:31.359
- Don't encourage this.

01:31.459 --> 01:32.393
- It was a phenomenal layup.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.195
- Ugh.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.629
- A layup is when you
dribble the ball...

01:35.729 --> 01:37.331
- I don't care
what a layup is.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.333
- You'd care what
a lay-down is, though.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.335
- All right.
- Oh, nailed it.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.204
[Say Hi's "Back before
We Were Brittle" playing]

01:43.304 --> 01:45.873
- * Hey, remember when

01:45.973 --> 01:48.642
* All of time stood still

01:48.742 --> 01:53.347
* Ooh, do do do do

01:53.447 --> 01:56.717
* Back before we were brittle

01:56.817 --> 02:01.155
* Back before
we were brittle *

02:01.255 --> 02:03.624
- Whew, man, it's too bad
I'm working so much

02:03.724 --> 02:05.226
right now, Mark, 'cause I'd
love to give you

02:05.326 --> 02:07.628
a little of this old
razzle-dazzle.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.497
Hey!
- Ooooh!

02:09.597 --> 02:12.233
Uh-oh. Steph Curry
in the house, huh?

02:12.333 --> 02:14.402
Mags, love that you're reffing.
- Oh, thanks.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.504
- But it would
really help me out

02:16.604 --> 02:18.306
if you could not call fouls

02:18.406 --> 02:19.673
when Mary Pat starts
throwing the elbs.

02:19.773 --> 02:20.674
- Oh, no sir.

02:20.774 --> 02:21.675
When the stripes go on,

02:21.775 --> 02:23.177
I'm not your friend.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.445
- I respect that.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.180
Intentional foul.
Unsportsmanlike conduct.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.748
You're outta here!
- Come on, ref!

02:27.848 --> 02:31.452
- Wow, I'm loving all these
basketball words, guys.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.488
Hey, Mark, when were you
gonna tell me

02:34.588 --> 02:36.490
that my mom joined the team?

02:36.590 --> 02:38.459
- Oh, I didn't know
that was something I--

02:38.559 --> 02:39.693
I needed to tell you.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.195
- You don't think
it's convenient

02:41.295 --> 02:42.363
that just days ago

02:42.463 --> 02:43.497
I told my mother
that we're together

02:43.597 --> 02:45.666
and suddenly she wants to get
all up in your business?

02:45.766 --> 02:47.301
- I think she just
wants to have fun

02:47.401 --> 02:48.636
and get some exercise
like everybody else.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.438
- Yeah, I don't think
this is about you.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.573
- It's always about me, guys!

02:52.673 --> 02:54.542
When are you gonna get that
through your thick skulls?

02:54.642 --> 02:55.709
She's obsessed with me.

02:55.809 --> 02:56.744
She even dyed her hair

02:56.844 --> 02:58.412
so she could look more like me.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.782
Okay, you guys got
a bunch of basketballs

03:01.882 --> 03:03.684
shoved up your butts, and you're
not seeing straight.

03:03.784 --> 03:04.752
- I'm sorry, what would
our buttholes

03:04.852 --> 03:06.554
have to do with our vision?

03:06.654 --> 03:08.722
Like, why would basketballs
preclude us from seeing--

03:08.822 --> 03:10.691
- Why would basketballs
in our anus

03:10.791 --> 03:12.426
and have anything to do
with our ocular abilities?

03:12.526 --> 03:13.527
- I am telling you this.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.962
When a Crawford
willingly chooses

03:15.062 --> 03:16.797
to be seen in a pair of shorts,

03:16.897 --> 03:18.566
something terrible's afoot.

03:18.666 --> 03:19.700
- Well, that's true.
- That is true.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.968
- And you need to
think fast!

03:22.370 --> 03:23.371
- No.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.805
I was trying to hit you
in the head.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.474
technical foul.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.342
- Your face is a technical foul!

03:28.442 --> 03:29.977
- You're outta here!
- You're outta here!

03:30.077 --> 03:31.512
That's basketball?
- That's baseball.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.713
That's baseball.
- I don't care.

03:32.813 --> 03:33.814
- You better hit the showers,
young lady.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.449
- Yeah, hit the showers.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.618
- I'll be there in a minute.
- Gross.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.588
What's going on, CharBar?

03:40.688 --> 03:43.724
You not hungry?
Should we try the other side?

03:43.824 --> 03:46.226
- Well, looks like it's
just the girls tonight.

03:47.495 --> 03:48.762
- He canceled on me
because my mother

03:48.862 --> 03:51.665
is hosting a team-only
screening of "Hoosiers."

03:51.765 --> 03:53.734
- That is my number-one
sports film.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.270
Gene Hackman, Barbara Hershey,
a couple of unknowns

03:56.370 --> 03:57.671
fighting for their
shot at glory--

03:57.771 --> 04:00.341
- Super weird, one, that
that's your favorite movie.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.342
- Well, that,
"Silence of the Lambs,"

04:01.442 --> 04:02.643
and also "Brigadoon."

04:02.743 --> 04:04.512
- That makes no sense,
and if you profiled that,

04:04.612 --> 04:05.846
it would mean you
are a psychopath.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.615
Secondly...
- Or a genius.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.318
- I don't understand.
She never liked Mark.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.353
I mean, the whole time
we dated in high school,

04:12.453 --> 04:14.522
he was not invited
to our house once.

04:14.622 --> 04:15.756
- Well, she seems
to like him now.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.491
- Oh, my God.
That's it.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.759
She's trying to break us up.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.494
- I don't know.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.331
But I'm gonna find out.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.732
- What is going on with you,
baby girl?

04:24.832 --> 04:26.033
- I don't know.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.302
She doesn't want to nurse.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.670
No, it's like she doesn't
give a hoot

04:29.770 --> 04:31.038
about these old boobers anymore.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.842
- She's not weaning.
- I mean, she's one years old.

04:34.942 --> 04:38.278
- Yeah, but this is also our
special cuddle time together.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.780
- You're gonna have other
special cuddle time,

04:39.880 --> 04:41.749
even when she's not sucking
on those mammer jams.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.585
It might be nice to have them
back to yourself.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.454
- Maybe it's 'cause I've been
at the hospital so much.

04:46.554 --> 04:47.621
I mean, she's been spending
a lot of time

04:47.721 --> 04:48.822
with Bruce and Cookie.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.658
- There you go.
When there's a problem,

04:50.758 --> 04:53.293
it's best to always
first blame Bruce.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.495
- Okay.
- Just like my mom.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.063
- Are we still talking
about this?

04:57.965 --> 05:01.335
- P-p-p-p-popcorn! Popcorn!

05:01.435 --> 05:03.671
S-s-s-s-soldier Field!

05:03.771 --> 05:07.408
- Wow, that's a sweet
setup, Bruce.

05:07.508 --> 05:08.842
- Yeah, when Caruso Construction
sponsors an event,

05:08.942 --> 05:10.411
we go all out.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.812
- Yeah.
- Check these babies out.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.648
- Fresh off the presses.

05:14.748 --> 05:15.816
- Wow!

05:15.916 --> 05:17.651
That panther really
hates that basketball.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.554
- Coach Mark!
- Aha, there she is!

05:20.654 --> 05:23.090
My MVP! All right.
What's going on?

05:23.190 --> 05:24.725
- Coach Mark!
- All right.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.527
Ooh, a little pinky swear.
I like that.

05:26.627 --> 05:27.928
Hey, thanks so much for
hosting us last night.

05:28.028 --> 05:28.929
- "Hoosiers."
- Yes.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.564
- Ahh, seminal film.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.932
Really highlights the importance

05:32.032 --> 05:33.834
of the coach-player
relationship.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.604
- Yeah. Sometimes I wish that
Gene Hackman was my father.

05:36.704 --> 05:37.771
- Well, as your star player,

05:37.871 --> 05:39.707
I would really love
to hear your, uh--

05:39.807 --> 05:40.874
your approach to coaching.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.476
- Okay.
- And--and life.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.711
- Effort is everything.
- Yup.

05:43.811 --> 05:44.878
- Uh, never forget
the intangibles.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.947
- Good.
- And, uh, stats are overrated.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.617
- Hmm. How do you feel
about rebounding?

05:49.717 --> 05:50.718
- It's a crucial
part of the game.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.386
- Very interesting.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.422
But sometimes when one
rebounds, you know,

05:54.522 --> 05:56.724
you touch the ball and you just
toss it away too quickly.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.492
- Sure, s-sometimes...

05:58.592 --> 06:01.729
- And that's when
people get hurt.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.964
- Gwen, are we still
talking about basketball?

06:04.064 --> 06:06.366
- What else would we
be talking about?

06:06.467 --> 06:09.470
- Okay.
- Let me ask you about cheating.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.472
Do you condone it?

06:11.572 --> 06:12.706
- I have never cheated

06:12.806 --> 06:14.775
on the court or in life.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.144
Emma and I got together after
my divorce was finalized.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.146
- Whoa!

06:19.246 --> 06:20.881
Keep your personal life
to yourself, buddy.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.883
This is basketball we're
talking about, man.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.153
- Coming in at a respectable
height and weight,

06:26.253 --> 06:27.855
and wearing shorts,

06:27.955 --> 06:31.625
your newest member
of the Pinebrook Panthers,

06:31.725 --> 06:34.161
Emma Crawford!

06:34.261 --> 06:36.497
- Let's get ready...

06:36.597 --> 06:38.632
to basketball!

06:38.732 --> 06:39.767
Ugh!

06:42.970 --> 06:44.572
Was I close?

06:47.575 --> 06:50.043
- All right, everybody,
let's huddle up.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.178
Huddle up. Here we go.
All right.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.446
Nice work, ladies.
Nice work.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.447
All right.
- Whoo!

06:53.547 --> 06:54.848
- Now just a reminder,

06:54.948 --> 06:56.484
if you want to move
the ball forward,

06:56.584 --> 06:58.151
you have to dribble it.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.153
- Yes, every time.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.155
- Ugh, this game is so hard.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.524
- All right.
Panthers on three, guys.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.858
All right, you ready?
- All right.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.060
- One, two, three.
all: Panthers!

07:07.160 --> 07:08.095
- All right.
- All right.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.163
- Okay, ladies.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.800
- Uh, hey, Mom, can I
talk to you for a sec?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.502
- If it doesn't interfere
with my cool-down.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.069
Hundred free throws.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.905
- Oh, God, give it up, Mom.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.773
No one's buying
the Larry Bird routine.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.175
- I'll have you know I was
all-state in high school.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.844
Spent a semester
playing in college

07:23.944 --> 07:25.513
before I met your father.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.548
- Why are you spending so much
time with my boyfriend?

07:27.648 --> 07:28.949
- He's my coach.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.183
- Come on, I know
what's going on.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.952
All right? You're trying
to get involved,

07:32.052 --> 07:33.621
get in between the two of us.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.823
Well, you can take
your best shot,

07:35.923 --> 07:37.190
but I'm gonna block it.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.626
I'm blocking that.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.994
Oh, you're running scared now.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.496
Uggghh!

07:42.596 --> 07:44.998
Ahhh!

07:45.098 --> 07:46.166
- Work on your D,

07:46.266 --> 07:47.234
'cause we're gonna need everyone

07:47.334 --> 07:48.602
if we want to beat Danbury.

07:48.702 --> 07:51.238
Even the weakest link.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.640
- Hnngh!

07:52.740 --> 07:54.074
- Swish.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.582
God, there is something
just so sexy

08:01.682 --> 08:02.950
about a man with an iron.

08:04.652 --> 08:05.653
You like this, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.187
- Oh, yeah.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.589
Get your back into it.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.058
Oh, that's hot.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.626
I got to tell you,

08:12.726 --> 08:15.663
you are a profound
detriment to our team.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.264
But boy, it's great
having you around.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.633
- Anything I can do
to support my man.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.169
You just call me Tami T.
- Okay.

08:22.269 --> 08:25.105
- But at the same time, I do
need you to quit this team.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.506
I'm not quitting the team.

08:26.607 --> 08:27.641
- Mark, I am not
joking around.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.076
This is important.
My mom is--

08:29.176 --> 08:30.544
- I talked to your mom.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.079
- Everything is fine.
It's all handled.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.581
Coach to player.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.015
- Okay, you need to
understand something.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.550
My mother does not like you.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.085
She has never liked you.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.620
- And that's something
you feel like you needed

08:39.720 --> 08:40.621
to say to me out loud?

08:40.721 --> 08:42.189
- I feel it's important

08:42.289 --> 08:43.924
that you know what you're
dealing with, okay?

08:44.024 --> 08:46.594
- Hey, with the way things are
going between you and I,

08:46.694 --> 08:47.995
I think it's important

08:48.095 --> 08:50.063
that I learn how to get
along with your mom.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.232
I don't get along
with my mom.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.868
- Okay. I'm gonna
finish this up at home.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.303
Ugh. Wow.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.105
This is exactly
what she wants.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.206
She wants to drive
a wedge between us.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.307
- Honey, it's gonna be fine.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.109
I really need you
to get some rest.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.545
All right? 'Cause we got
ourselves a big game tomorrow.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.147
- Okay, well, just FYI,

09:07.247 --> 09:09.883
that was very Coach Taylor
to my Tami T.,

09:09.983 --> 09:11.585
and I am into it, y'all.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.588
'Cause the clear eyes
and the full pants--

09:14.688 --> 09:16.289
we'll win.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.026
- Okay.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.929
- Mags, devil's
at the doorstep,

09:22.029 --> 09:23.263
and Mark is just
inviting her right in.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.932
- That's vampires.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.199
Vampires are the ones you have
to invite in.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.635
- Let me remind you, Maggie,

09:27.735 --> 09:29.036
that when Mark proposed to me,

09:29.136 --> 09:31.171
it was my mother who told me
to leave for China

09:31.271 --> 09:32.640
and not tell him.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.941
Did you do it?

09:34.041 --> 09:35.175
Or did your mom do it?

09:35.275 --> 09:36.176
- Okay--
- I'm pretty sure it was you.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.045
- I think that's off-topic.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.947
- You could've stayed.
You could've married Mark.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.181
But you didn't.
You went to China

09:41.281 --> 09:42.950
and totally ghosted him.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.118
- My mother is meddling.
I assure you.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.119
- That was a long time ago,
okay?

09:46.219 --> 09:47.621
Your mom has changed.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.122
- That's definitely
not what's happening.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.091
- Well, maybe she's
attempting to change,

09:51.191 --> 09:52.626
and you are stopping her.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.194
- Ugh, these theories, Maggie.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.063
You got to work on 'em.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.731
- What is going on
with these PJs?

09:57.831 --> 09:59.066
- Oh, they're too small.
You know what?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.768
Let me put 'em in
the donate pile.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.670
You're not
giving away her teddy bears.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.206
- She needs her teddy bears.
- No, that's crazy.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.741
- These are her favorite
teddy bears.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.678
- Maggie, her toe is busting
out of them Hook-style.

10:10.778 --> 10:11.679
- No, no, no, no.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.246
What, did you shrink them?

10:13.346 --> 10:15.949
- She's growing up.
- Well, I don't like it.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.718
Okay? I'm working so much

10:17.818 --> 10:20.020
and I'm never here, and it's
all going by way too fast,

10:20.120 --> 10:21.689
and it's hurting my feelings.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.757
- I know, but we don't want her
to stay a baby forever,

10:23.857 --> 10:25.358
like Benjamin Button.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.760
- No, he doesn't stay
a baby forever.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.729
He ages backwards.
Why?

10:28.829 --> 10:30.130
- That's why it's
a curious case.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.033
- Ugh. Not interested.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.969
Aagh, I can't keep my underwear
from riding up in these shorts.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.705
- That's why I free ball it.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.373
Swing, swing, ding, ding.
Got it?

10:40.473 --> 10:43.376
- No, I don't got it.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.018
Magic Johnson?

10:51.118 --> 10:52.753
It's my
basketball name.

10:52.853 --> 10:53.821
- You know that's
a real person.

10:53.921 --> 10:56.023
- Yeah. Earvin Magic
Johnson, Jr.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.091
Who could forget his
epic rivalry with Bird

10:58.191 --> 11:01.061
or his--his return to glory
in the '92 All

11:01.161 --> 11:05.165
Not to mention he has
exquisite taste in suits.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.369
Mom, I'm sorry.

11:11.171 --> 11:15.108
- Please. Call me Magic.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.310
- Magic, I-I'm sorry.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.412
I thought you were just meddling
in my business again,

11:19.512 --> 11:22.282
but apparently you really
do love this crazy sport.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.151
- I do.
- Yeah.

11:24.251 --> 11:27.687
So let's go out there and...

11:27.788 --> 11:29.289
make a brick, or whatever.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.158
- Ladies.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.026
Let's take a knee.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.428
Okay, you guys, it's game time.
- Yeah!

11:35.528 --> 11:37.064
- Some people think that

11:37.164 --> 11:38.198
when you get to the top
of the mountain--

11:38.298 --> 11:39.199
- Mark--
- That's the--

11:39.299 --> 11:40.267
- Mark.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.334
I'd like to say a few words.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.770
- Okay, all right, I was--

11:42.870 --> 11:44.471
I thought I was
doing that, but--

11:44.571 --> 11:46.106
- Comrades in sport,

11:46.206 --> 11:48.041
I have truly enjoyed
the last few weeks.

11:48.141 --> 11:51.178
However, like Lance Armstrong
in the Tour De France,

11:51.278 --> 11:52.712
I have a confession to make.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.447
- I knew it.
She's on roids.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.216
- Mary Pat...

11:56.316 --> 11:58.318
- The reason I joined this team

11:58.418 --> 12:01.721
was really to investigate
the romantic relationship

12:01.822 --> 12:03.757
between my daughter
and Coach Mark.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.293
- Can I definitely, definitely
take back my apology?

12:06.393 --> 12:07.795
- Nope.
You already said it.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.729
- Okay, now that we got
all that out of the way,

12:09.830 --> 12:11.331
let's go play some
basketball, right?

12:11.431 --> 12:14.401
- 15 long years ago...
- Son of a gun.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.770
- When Mark proposed to Emma,

12:16.870 --> 12:19.439
I counseled her to say no
and flee to China.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.074
- This is not really
the time for this.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.409
You told your daughter
not to marry me?

12:22.509 --> 12:23.844
- I did.
- Okay--

12:23.944 --> 12:26.246
- But what made me feel
really bad is that...

12:26.346 --> 12:28.448
That night, when you
came to the door--

12:29.950 --> 12:31.484
- Yes, of course I
came to the door.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.921
- Like a wet golden retriever
looking for his ball.

12:34.021 --> 12:36.824
So I lied and said that you'd
already left for China,

12:36.924 --> 12:39.827
when in fact, you were upstairs
blubbering on your daybed.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.862
- Unbelievable.

12:41.962 --> 12:45.465
- Oh, God, that is such
a weight off my shoulders.

12:45.565 --> 12:46.867
Okay, Panthers on three.
- You were upstairs.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.235
- No, no, no. I--

12:48.335 --> 12:51.238
all: One, two, three.
Panthers!

12:51.338 --> 12:53.473
- Let's go, girls.
I can smell the victory.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.519
- Get back on D, guys.
Get your hands up, please!

13:08.455 --> 13:10.557
- You have to wonder
what's going on

13:10.657 --> 13:12.125
with the Panthers tonight.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.027
They're getting
absolutely demolished

13:14.127 --> 13:15.462
by the Danbury Dragons.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.030
Speaking of demolitions,

13:17.130 --> 13:18.866
your experts at Caruso
Construction are here

13:18.966 --> 13:20.868
to help you get rid of that old
shed, carport, or gazebo.

13:20.968 --> 13:21.869
- Again, Mark,

13:21.969 --> 13:23.170
I am just so sorry.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.838
I mean, I knew my mom
didn't like you,

13:24.938 --> 13:26.239
but I had no idea she
would stoop that low.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.574
- Emma, it was a long time ago.

13:27.674 --> 13:28.575
I can't talk about
that right now.

13:28.675 --> 13:29.576
I am focused on keeping Mary Pat

13:29.676 --> 13:30.844
out of foul trouble.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.981
Go! Sit down!
- Okay.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.016
- Bug off!

13:36.116 --> 13:38.218
Nine blue.
Pushing.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.853
- Come on!
- Time out red.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.288
- Keep the elbows in, Mary Pat.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.457
Please. You're like
a windmill out there!

13:44.557 --> 13:46.559
- Maggie. Maggie!

13:46.659 --> 13:48.528
- Yeah, Mr. Nanjiani,
what's up?

13:48.628 --> 13:50.297
- The Panthers could
use some help.

13:50.397 --> 13:54.868
Maybe this international calling
card can sweeten the deal?

13:54.968 --> 13:56.970
- No way.

13:57.070 --> 14:00.908
But maybe Charlotte might travel
abroad and want to call Mommy.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.210
- She's a baby.
She's not going abroad.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.045
Okay? Game on!

14:05.145 --> 14:09.082
- Please, Maggie, I got a lot
of money on this game!

14:09.182 --> 14:12.552
- Stay on her!

14:12.652 --> 14:15.522
- The Panthers are really
laying an egg.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.226
- I don't like the way we're
running the pick-and-roll.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.560
Well, I guess
there's a lot of things

14:20.660 --> 14:21.594
you don't like about me.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.498
You are the problem.

14:25.598 --> 14:26.967
- Oh, please,
I'm slicing their D

14:27.067 --> 14:28.335
like a hot knife through butter.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.003
- Emma, why don't you go sub in
for Mary Pat?

14:30.103 --> 14:31.905
- Mom, what don't you
like about Mark?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.642
- Is it 'cause he's not
a fancy businessman?

14:35.742 --> 14:37.911
Because he lives in
an apartment building

14:38.011 --> 14:39.112
filled with divorcees
and strippers?

14:39.212 --> 14:40.880
- That's unsavory.

14:40.981 --> 14:41.982
- Is it 'cause he hasn't had
one hair on his head

14:42.082 --> 14:43.883
since he was 20 years old?

14:43.984 --> 14:45.185
- Can I ask you to list all the
things that are wrong with me

14:45.285 --> 14:46.619
after the game?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.055
- I'm trying to work
something out here!

14:48.155 --> 14:49.256
- Great idea!

14:49.356 --> 14:51.124
Though I must say,
I don't know why

14:51.224 --> 14:52.292
anyone with a head
that looks like that

14:52.392 --> 14:53.660
would choose to be bald.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.529
- It's genetic!

14:56.629 --> 14:58.131
- Maggie, you got to throw me
out of this game.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.599
Gwen and Emma are
driving me insane.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.134
- Can't just throw you out
for no reason.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.202
- Maggie, please!

15:02.302 --> 15:03.303
- Got to give me
a reason, Coach.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.141
You should open an agency,
because that was a travel!

15:08.241 --> 15:09.676
- I respectfully disagree, sir.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.012
That was a travel.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.981
Traveling! Blue ball!

15:14.081 --> 15:16.049
- Okay. All right.
I see what you're doing.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.217
- You need to understand
something.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.219
Mark is here to stay, okay?

15:19.319 --> 15:21.654
Mom, stop sipping
that sports drink!

15:21.754 --> 15:24.291
- What, you don't want me
to replace my electrolytes?

15:24.391 --> 15:26.393
- God, why do you not
want me to be happy?

15:26.493 --> 15:28.395
- All I want is for
you to be happy.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.363
- Then stop trying
to break us up!

15:30.463 --> 15:33.300
Emma, I left
college my sophomore year

15:33.400 --> 15:34.701
to marry your father.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.203
- Yes, I've heard
all about it.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.604
- Yeah, but you haven't heard--

15:37.704 --> 15:40.407
I regretted it for
the rest of my life.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.242
Except for you.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.212
You're the thing
I'm most proud of.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.015
- Mom...
- I didn't want you to settle,

15:48.115 --> 15:49.349
like I did.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.251
I wanted you to have
a chance to--

15:51.351 --> 15:55.188
to go out and--
and experience the world.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.024
- Is that what all this
Gwennaissance stuff

15:57.124 --> 15:58.325
has been about?

15:58.425 --> 16:01.261
- It gave me a chance
to chase my hoop dreams.

16:01.361 --> 16:05.098
- Well, you do have a natural
talent for...

16:05.198 --> 16:07.600
the bouncing of the balls
or whatever.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.236
- Hey, ref! Ref!

16:09.336 --> 16:11.138
You want a trumpet?
Because you're blowing it!

16:11.238 --> 16:12.605
How about--how about you check
your answering machine,

16:12.705 --> 16:14.141
'cause you're missing calls!

16:14.241 --> 16:15.408
- Hey, watch yourself, Coach.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.444
I just hope Charlotte
starts walking soon,

16:17.544 --> 16:19.346
so you know what
walking looks like.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.215
- I said, I just hope
Charlotte walks soon,

16:22.315 --> 16:23.683
so you know what
walking looks like.

16:23.783 --> 16:27.187
Because--wait.
Wait, why are you crying?

16:27.287 --> 16:29.156
No, no, no, Maggie.
I'm sorry.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.391
I--I take that back.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.393
- Ref, we need a time-out.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.628
- Gwen, you can't call
a time-out from the bench.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.130
- I'll allow it.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.232
I think we could all use
a time-out right now.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.068
- Oh, there it goes.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.402
We're just done then, huh?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.371
- An unorthodox time-out call

16:44.471 --> 16:47.207
from the MVP on
the Panthers bench.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.109
And speaking of benches,

16:49.209 --> 16:51.178
Caruso Construction is here
to help you tackle

16:51.278 --> 16:52.645
all of your benching needs.

16:52.745 --> 16:57.050
Mags

16:57.150 --> 17:00.387
- I just--I feel like
Charlotte's growing up too fast.

17:00.487 --> 17:04.124
Yeah.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.259
But you know what, Mags?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.461
Remember when she was a newborn

17:08.561 --> 17:10.697
and we thought there
could be nothing better

17:10.797 --> 17:12.065
than those sweet smiles?

17:12.165 --> 17:13.233
- Right.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.667
- And then she
started crawling.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.036
And we thought nothing
could be better than that.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.706
And then she said her first
words, and it was like--

17:19.806 --> 17:22.142
- The best thing that
ever happened.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.476
- Yeah.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.412
There's just gonna keep on being
new best things

17:25.512 --> 17:28.081
all the time, because you're
doing such an amazing job

17:28.181 --> 17:30.717
as a mom that she feels
comfortable trying new things.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.519
- Maybe I'll be
a worse mom.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.287
- What could I have
said different

17:34.387 --> 17:37.090
so that you wouldn't
say that about yourself?

17:37.190 --> 17:39.526
You're the best, Mags.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.328
- You're a good dad, too, Bruce.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.230
- Thanks, Mags.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.697
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:44.797 --> 17:47.167
I have to go shoot people
in the face with T-shirts.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.435
- Mm-hmm.

17:48.535 --> 17:49.502
- Mark, I'd like to clear
something up.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.770
- O-okay.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.505
- When you proposed to Emma,

17:52.605 --> 17:54.507
I did have my reservations.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.776
But since then,
you followed your dreams.

17:56.876 --> 17:59.346
You've found your way
back to one another,

17:59.446 --> 18:01.448
and clearly, it's meant to be.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.183
- Thank you, Mom.
- Therefore,

18:03.283 --> 18:04.717
I give you my blessing.

18:04.817 --> 18:07.354
- That means a lot.
In the future, I would really--

18:07.454 --> 18:09.322
- I promise, I will refrain

18:09.422 --> 18:11.258
from meddling in your
relationship.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.160
- Thank you, Mom.
- Thank you very much.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.195
- Just promise me one thing:
you won't get married outdoors.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.496
- Mom--
- It's not meddling.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.465
It's good taste.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.201
- Enough of this kissy-kissy,
huggy-huggy crap.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.237
Let's play some ball!
- You said it, Mary Pat.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.538
Get out there, ladies.
Quick, get out there.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.341
- Let's get ready to basketball!
- Not you.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.278
- Pinebrook down by 16.
Five to play.

18:34.581 --> 18:41.488
*

18:42.522 --> 18:45.525
Another basket for my ma!

18:45.625 --> 18:47.460
- Ball, ball!

18:49.796 --> 18:52.432
Yes!
- Hoop, there it is!

18:55.235 --> 18:56.436
- Good steal, Gwen, good steal!

18:56.536 --> 19:02.509
*

19:02.609 --> 19:05.345
- And the Panthers have
made a huge comeback

19:05.445 --> 19:09.382
thanks to the fantastic play
of Magic Johnson!

19:09.482 --> 19:11.584
I can't believe I get
to say that.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.788
Panthers are down by one.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.258
They've got to hustle!

19:18.358 --> 19:20.327
- You're getting trapped.
You're getting trapped!

19:22.495 --> 19:24.364
- Mom, I'm free! I'm free!

19:24.464 --> 19:26.333
- Mary Pat!
Get it to Mary Pat!

19:26.433 --> 19:28.535
Back to Mary Pat!

19:28.635 --> 19:30.403
I'm free!

19:30.503 --> 19:32.405
- Oh, all right.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.541
- Johnson to Crawford!
- Oh, my God.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.609
- She's got it!
- Shoot it!

19:36.709 --> 19:39.812
- Five, four...

19:39.912 --> 19:41.514
- Shoot it!

19:41.614 --> 19:42.915
- That way!

19:43.015 --> 19:46.253
- Two!
- Shoot it!

19:46.353 --> 19:53.260
*

20:00.400 --> 20:01.901
Game over.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.403
- Nuts.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.604
- The Dragons win.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.942
- This is why I don't
do things with you.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.578
- I love you too, Mom.

20:11.678 --> 20:16.215
- No! I just lost my house!

20:16.316 --> 20:17.517
- I'm sorry, guys.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.521
Here we go.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.522
- Let's see.
- Ooh.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.924
- Whoo!
- Alley-oop!

20:25.024 --> 20:27.760
- Baby, see, you're gonna be
dunking in no time.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.529
- As long as she doesn't
learn from Emma.

20:29.629 --> 20:30.930
You know we never
found that ball.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.632
It was a moral victory.

20:32.732 --> 20:33.900
Like in "Hoosiers."

20:34.000 --> 20:35.602
- Oh, they actually win
in that movie.

20:35.702 --> 20:36.903
- No, they win in that too.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.571
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on.

20:38.671 --> 20:39.939
How's a bunch of ducks
win a hockey game?

20:40.039 --> 20:41.541
They don't have hands.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.510
- I shouldn't even...

20:43.610 --> 20:45.512
- Use your brain.
- Mags, look.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.581
That's a walk!

20:48.681 --> 20:50.550
That was a walk.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.251
- I think she has
my coordination.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.920
- God, I hope not.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.455
- You did it!
