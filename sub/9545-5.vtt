Oh, don't mention it.
It's ancient history.

What happened last year?
Well, it's not worth mentioning.

05:54.921 --> 05:58.550
We had a mystery weekend,

05:58.624 --> 06:02.583
and we hired some actors who were
going to act out a little murder.

And, uh, it was supposed
to be for three days.

for three days.

06:10.303 --> 06:13.898
Adrian solved the case in-
What was it, 12 minutes?

06:13.973 --> 06:17.238
L-I knew that the general's daughter
was lying about meeting Churchill,

06:17.310 --> 06:20.211
because Churchill
wasn't knighted till 1953.

06:20.279 --> 06:24.943
Which meant that Reginald,
the limping chauffeur who supplied
her alibi, was also lying.

06:25.017 --> 06:28.953
So obviously, they were lovers
who were planning to kill the sultan...

06:29.021 --> 06:33.754
and steal the Arabian emerald.
Anyway, uh, we had to refund
everybody's money.

06:33.826 --> 06:37.557

But we learned our lesson.

and he says, "Doctor, my wife
thinks she's a refrigerator."

<i>"Well, just ignore her."</i>

Were you drinking?
Just a little.
Not even a glass.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.554
[Groans]
Oh.

13:18.631 --> 13:23.193
Oh, I met a guy. He's in 202.
He said he had a cure for this.

13:23.269 --> 13:27.296
Uh, he said it was-
He said it was guaranteed.

13:27.373 --> 13:30.035
Well, here. 202.
202.

13:34.280 --> 13:38.148
Larry? It's-It's Adrian
from last night.

13:38.217 --> 13:40.151
Hello?

13:40.219 --> 13:43.416
Oh, sorry.
L-I was looking for Larry.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.822
Huh?
Ah, did you switch rooms?

13:46.892 --> 13:48.917
No, no.

13:48.994 --> 13:52.293
Well, he said 202,
at the back.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.355
Well, who-who-who are you
talking about?

13:55.835 --> 13:59.362
Larry- Larry Zwibell,

13:59.438 --> 14:02.271
uh, from last night.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.708
You played poker with him?
Uh, no, no, you're mistaken.

14:05.778 --> 14:10.511
You see, I don't know
anybody by this name.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

14:11.584 --> 14:15.418
Oh, good morning.
I hope you're hungry.
Hi, good morning.

14:15.487 --> 14:18.047
Uh, we're looking for a guest-
a Larry Zwibell?

14:18.123 --> 14:22.719
Uh, who?
He checked in last night.
You remember? Room 202.

14:22.795 --> 14:26.458
Adrian, nobody checked in yesterday
except for you and Natalie.

14:26.532 --> 14:30.195
No. No, no, no.
Sylvia, I talked to him.

14:30.269 --> 14:32.999
He-He- Larry Zwibell.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.472
Uh, see for yourself.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.481
He was here.
I talked to him.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.918
You have to believe me.

15:16.615 --> 15:18.549
Okay.

15:18.617 --> 15:21.017
There are three cars
in the parking lot, plus mine.

15:21.086 --> 15:24.749
The same three cars
that were there last night.
Maybe he left.

15:24.823 --> 15:27.451
That wouldn't explain
why everybody's lying.

15:27.526 --> 15:29.960
Then why didn't
he check in?
He did check in.

15:30.029 --> 15:33.021
He said Room 202. Look.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.659
We signed in on the bottom
of this page.

15:36.735 --> 15:40.398
Sylvia could have removed
the next page.

15:40.472 --> 15:42.736
Why would she do that,
Mr. Monk?

15:44.076 --> 15:46.135
I don't know.

15:46.211 --> 15:48.873
Something happened.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.610
Something happened here.

15:51.684 --> 15:56.144
Come on. Are you sure
you only had one drink?

16:00.392 --> 16:04.385
Natalie, I met him.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.099
He-He spoke Spanish,

16:08.167 --> 16:12.831
and he reeked of... Aqua Velva.

16:16.241 --> 16:18.232
You believe me, right?

16:21.814 --> 16:26.308
You said we have to believe each other.
You said that was the rule.

16:26.385 --> 16:29.821
That's true. That's true.

16:36.462 --> 16:39.556
[Clears Throat]
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you all,

16:39.631 --> 16:42.998
but we're looking for a guest,
Larry Zwibell.

16:43.068 --> 16:45.696
He was here last night.
Uh, who?

16:45.771 --> 16:47.739
[Laughs]
I told you I never heard of him.

16:48.874 --> 16:51.536
He played poker with you.

16:51.610 --> 16:54.374
He told you that joke
about the psychiatrist.

16:54.446 --> 16:57.040
<i>The wife who thinks</i>
<i>she's a refrigerator.</i>

16:57.116 --> 16:59.710
And the psychiatrist says,
"Just ignore it."

16:59.785 --> 17:03.881
But the man says, "I can't,
because when she sleeps
with her mouth open,

17:03.956 --> 17:06.789
the little light inside her mouth
keeps me awake."

17:06.858 --> 17:08.884
[All Laughing]
That's brilliant.

17:08.961 --> 17:12.328
Why-Why are you laughing?
Because it's funny.

17:12.397 --> 17:16.698
B-B-But you already heard it.
You heard it last night.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.598
They already heard it.
Maybe it's your delivery.

17:22.674 --> 17:27.008
[Sighs] Did you notice
the French guy did this?

17:27.079 --> 17:30.515
That's his tell. I was watching him
play poker last night.

17:30.582 --> 17:33.608
Whenever he bluffed,
he rubbed his nose.

17:33.685 --> 17:37.416
I'm telling you.
He did it upstairs earlier too.

17:37.489 --> 17:39.423
He's lying. They are all lying.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.925
It's- It's a conspiracy.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.929
Mr. Monk, why?

17:44.997 --> 17:47.158
They don't even know each other.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.895
Ah, Ricardo.
<i>Se√±or?</i>

17:55.240 --> 17:57.765
Ricardo, you remember
my friend?

17:57.843 --> 18:00.937
He- He was sitting with me
at that table right there.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.948
He spoke Spanish to you.
He ordered the Degout pinot.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.576
I am sorry, <i>se√±or.</i>

18:06.652 --> 18:09.086
There was no one there.
You were alone all night.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.349
Ricardo.
Excuse me.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.094
Well, you're gettin'
an early start.
[Laughs]

18:22.167 --> 18:24.601
The tasting doesn't begin
until noon.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.661
May I?

18:26.738 --> 18:29.002
Oh, they make this here.

18:29.074 --> 18:32.134
Mmm. They just released it
this morning.

18:32.211 --> 18:35.203
How is it?
It's good.
It's, uh- It's sweet.

18:35.280 --> 18:39.979
But it has a, um-
has a weird aftertaste to it.
Ahh.

18:40.052 --> 18:44.079
Do you taste it?
Mmm, no, not really.

18:44.156 --> 18:46.647
I'm a little bit worried
about your friend.

18:46.725 --> 18:51.321
I'm a psychiatrist,
and I saw him yesterday
talking to an empty chair.

18:51.396 --> 18:55.560
Oh, yeah, he does that.
His wife died eight years ago.
He talks to her.

18:55.634 --> 19:00.094
Mrs. Willis said
he used to be a detective.
He was discharged.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.572
May I ask, why is he here?

19:02.641 --> 19:06.634
Well, it's his anniversary,
and they honeymooned here, so-

19:06.712 --> 19:12.378
So, this is probably a...
time of stress for him?

19:12.451 --> 19:14.419
Does he handle stress well?

19:14.486 --> 19:16.647
No. He handles stress unwell.

19:16.722 --> 19:22.627
Lonely, uh, children, uh, will sometimes
make up a person in their minds-

19:22.694 --> 19:26.061
an imaginary friend,
if you will.

19:26.131 --> 19:29.589
I've seen it a lot in my practice.
I've seen adults do it too.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.762
Well, you don't know Adrian Monk.
He's a great detective.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.602
The police don't make a move
without talking to him first.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.869
Now, I don't know
what's going on here,

19:37.943 --> 19:43.472
but if he says he met a man
named Larry Zwibell, then he met
a man named Larry Zwibell.

19:45.384 --> 19:48.217
Oh, this is interesting.

19:51.256 --> 19:53.349
There's nothing upstairs.

19:53.425 --> 19:55.359
What's going on?

19:55.427 --> 19:59.454
Uh, excuse me.

20:05.938 --> 20:09.567
- <i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>
- About what?

20:09.641 --> 20:11.632
The signature.

20:12.978 --> 20:15.003
The painter.

20:15.080 --> 20:18.538
He has the same name as-
As my hallucination?

20:18.617 --> 20:20.847
Hey, I didn't say that.

20:20.919 --> 20:25.253
But, Mr. Monk, you gotta admit
it looks kind of bad.

20:25.324 --> 20:31.285
People might think
that you saw the name...

20:31.363 --> 20:33.388
and made up a person.

20:36.435 --> 20:40.735
Or the man I met...

20:40.806 --> 20:43.434
saw the name on that painting...

20:43.508 --> 20:46.341
and decided to use it for himself.

20:54.653 --> 20:57.019
The camera.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.385
Natalie, they took a photo
last night-

21:01.460 --> 21:05.089
a-a-a group photo-
and he was in it.
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

21:05.163 --> 21:08.030
And this is our 2002
cabernet sauvignon.

21:08.100 --> 21:13.265
I think you'll like it.
It's slightly softer and more tannic
than the merlot.

21:16.108 --> 21:19.305
You've got to get
that camera.
Okay.

21:19.378 --> 21:21.676
All right, but you stay here.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.681
Ah. Will you be joining us?
Yes.

21:23.749 --> 21:26.047
Good. The more the merrier.
Thank you.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.518
Next we're going to try
the Syrah.

21:28.587 --> 21:32.887
<i>Now, the Syrah comes</i>
<i>from our very own grapes</i>
<i>in the east vineyard.</i>

21:34.893 --> 21:36.827
What are you drinking?

21:36.895 --> 21:40.456
Uh, it's the, uh-
the Sierra Springs.

21:40.532 --> 21:43.023
How is it?
It's exquisite.

21:43.101 --> 21:47.367
Is this your first wine tasting?

21:47.439 --> 21:51.068
I'll explain what they're doing.
There are five steps.
We call them the "Five S's"-

21:51.143 --> 21:53.304
Mm-hmm.
See, swirl, sniff, sip and spit.

21:53.378 --> 21:57.644
Now, they're on step one.
How does the wine look?

21:57.716 --> 21:59.946
Is it rich in color?
Does it react with the light?

22:00.018 --> 22:02.816
Excuse me.
Uh, what was that last one,

22:02.888 --> 22:05.857
uh, step five?
Spit.

22:05.924 --> 22:10.827
So, they're-they're-they're
going to be spitting?
That's it.

22:10.896 --> 22:14.662
Mmm. Here. I can hold
your camera for you.
Oh, I'm good.

22:14.733 --> 22:17.395
- <i>Now they're on step three.</i>
- Oh, step three.

22:17.469 --> 22:20.267
Sniffing. You smell the wine.
Inhale deeply.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.273
Do you smell the fruit
or the herbs?

22:22.341 --> 22:26.038
Uh, so that means, really,
there's only two steps left
until the spitting.

22:26.111 --> 22:29.603
That's right.
Uh, all-all at once?

22:29.681 --> 22:34.914
All of them spitting on the-
on the porch here, uh,
with me on-on the porch?

22:34.986 --> 22:38.922
- <i>Now they're sipping.</i>
- Sipping? So spitting is next.
Oh, God.

22:38.990 --> 22:41.185
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>Oh, here it comes.</i>

22:41.259 --> 22:44.023
[Groans]

22:44.096 --> 22:46.758
<i>[Groaning Continues]</i>

22:46.832 --> 22:49.426
<i>[Laughing]</i>

22:49.501 --> 22:51.435
This is so much fun, isn't it?

22:51.503 --> 22:53.767
How about a group shot?
A little newlywed group shot.
Um-

22:53.839 --> 22:57.070
I'll take it.
No. Maybe later.

22:58.276 --> 23:02.406
Oh, my God.
It's a kissing fern.

23:02.481 --> 23:05.279
A what?
Yeah. They're called
kissing ferns.

23:05.350 --> 23:08.911
It's supposed to be good luck
for newlyweds to kiss underneath one.

23:08.987 --> 23:13.617
Have you heard that song?
"Kiss Me Under the Kissing Fern, Baby"?

23:13.692 --> 23:15.660
Mmm.
Yeah, yeah.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.456
<i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>Yeah?</i>
<i>[Cal] Okay, yeah.</i>

23:17.529 --> 23:19.554
Yeah, okay, well,
in that case, uh-

23:20.565 --> 23:24.433
[Clears Throat]
Yeah.

23:24.503 --> 23:26.562
There, all right?
Oh, wow.

23:26.638 --> 23:30.233
Y-You don't get it. It's so cute.
Let me take a picture.

23:31.743 --> 23:35.736
Gotta get a great angle here.
[Mouthing Words]

23:37.182 --> 23:39.173
You can take the picture.
[Laughs]

23:39.251 --> 23:41.481
# Kiss me #

23:41.553 --> 23:44.283
# Underneath the kissin' fern #

23:44.356 --> 23:46.756
# Baby #

23:46.825 --> 23:49.919
#The hanging plant #

23:49.995 --> 23:53.021

[Snapping]

24:07.946 --> 24:11.006
[Sighs]

24:12.417 --> 24:16.012
You'll feel better
when you get home.
We'll call Dr. Kroger.

24:16.087 --> 24:19.056
It's Saturday.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.285
We'll call Dr. Kroger.

24:22.727 --> 24:26.857
Natalie, I met him.
I talked to him.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.124
He was so real.

24:30.202 --> 24:34.764
How could l-
How could I be so wrong?

24:34.840 --> 24:38.537
I'm never taking another drink
as long as I live.

24:38.610 --> 24:42.478
Mr. Monk, some people
just have no tolerance.

24:42.547 --> 24:45.607
I used to work in a bar.
I saw it all the time.

24:45.684 --> 24:50.951
You had two sips. That's like 10 shots
to a normal person.
Thank you.

24:51.022 --> 24:52.956
Hey, folks. How you doin'?

24:53.024 --> 24:55.322
Listen, I'm lookin' for my brother.
He's gone missing.

24:55.393 --> 24:57.327
Have you seen him?

24:59.064 --> 25:01.328
That's him!

25:01.399 --> 25:03.492
That's the guy!
You know him?

25:03.568 --> 25:06.036
L-I met him last night.

25:06.104 --> 25:10.404
- Really?
- That's him.

25:13.912 --> 25:15.903
Wanna tell me about it?

25:19.684 --> 25:23.347
I don't know what he told you, you know.
His real name is Ben Gruber.

25:23.421 --> 25:25.355
Our mother's been
worried sick about him.

25:25.423 --> 25:28.756
Thank God. I thought
I was losing my mind.

25:28.827 --> 25:31.057
I knew he was into wine,
so I've been checkin' all the vineyards...

25:31.129 --> 25:34.189
- and the little hotels in the area.
- And you're his brother?

25:34.266 --> 25:37.201
- Allen. Allen Gruber. Pleasure.
- Hi. Natalie Teeger.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.793
Natalie.
<i>This is Adrian Monk.</i>

25:38.870 --> 25:42.966
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>
<i>Everybody here is pretending</i>
<i>they never met him?</i>

25:43.041 --> 25:46.272
Everyone.
Aw, poor kid.

25:46.344 --> 25:48.710
- He's gotta be scared to death.
- Why?

25:50.982 --> 25:54.816
He stole some money from a bank
that he works for, right?

25:54.886 --> 25:56.820
And he took off.

25:56.888 --> 26:00.585
I talked to the local D.A., and she said,
you know, they'd go easy on him
if he turned himself in.

26:00.659 --> 26:03.719
That's why I'm here.
I figured, you know, if I showed up,

26:03.795 --> 26:06.787
maybe I could find him,
maybe I could talk him into
returning the money.

26:06.865 --> 26:08.924
- How much did he take?
- $3.1 million.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.934
Whew.
[Exhales]

26:11.002 --> 26:14.165
Although it sounds like
he's spending some of it already.

26:14.239 --> 26:18.608
He's been paying people off
to say they've never heard of him.

26:18.677 --> 26:20.975
<i>Do you think he's still here?</i>

26:21.046 --> 26:23.037
I mean, why would he stay?

26:24.549 --> 26:28.417
What was he driving?
'86 Buick, last I heard.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.858
What are the odds?
An '86 Buick.

26:37.929 --> 26:42.263
Well, it can't be his.
This car has been here forever.
Mmm, I don't think so.

26:42.334 --> 26:45.667
There's a dent here,
but no rust.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.932
And there's no rust
in the wheel wells.

26:48.006 --> 26:50.133
This car hasn't been here long.

26:50.208 --> 26:54.042
So he's still here
somewhere, right?
Well, he's not in that house.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.673
And we call this
the barrel room.

26:57.749 --> 27:02.277
These containers are filled
with 60 gallons of our
world-famous chardonnay.

27:02.354 --> 27:05.812
It's gonna age in these containers
for exactly 11 months.

27:05.890 --> 27:10.759
I like to think of it as a living thing,
like a baby growing inside
a mother's womb.

27:10.829 --> 27:13.798
Mr. Gruber.
I thought we'd lost you.

27:13.865 --> 27:16.527
Oh, sorry.
I just got turned around.

27:26.411 --> 27:30.006
If you follow me,
we're literally going to be
stepping back in time.

27:30.081 --> 27:35.542
Wine stomping. It's a tradition
that goes back thousands of years
to the Greeks.

27:35.620 --> 27:41.581
We're one of the last vineyards in California
that at least make some of their wine
using this method.

27:46.331 --> 27:49.232
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

27:49.300 --> 27:52.133
Do people actually
drink that?
Yeah, I think so.

27:52.203 --> 27:55.366
Are they insane?
Go ask her if they're insane.

27:55.440 --> 27:58.932
J-Just ask her.
I'm not gonna ask her that,
Mr. Monk.

27:59.010 --> 28:02.411
And of course, we can't press
all of our wine like this.
It would take too long.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.540
But we do make one label
using this method,

28:05.617 --> 28:07.585
the Allacco Cabernet.
[Yelps]

28:07.652 --> 28:10.246
It can be bought from
our store out front.

28:10.321 --> 28:12.551
Uh-
[Gags]

28:12.624 --> 28:17.425
<i>I can't believe that's the Allacco Cabernet.</i>
<i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>I know. Just take it easy.</i>

28:17.495 --> 28:21.056
I've been drinking that wine
for 15 years. It's foot wine.

28:22.467 --> 28:25.459
I can taste it.
Oh, well, come on.
You cannot taste it.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.700
L-l-I can.
I can taste the feet now.

28:28.773 --> 28:31.936
I can taste-And the toes-
What's between the toe-

28:32.010 --> 28:34.911
And the fungus.
It really is barbaric.

28:34.979 --> 28:38.312
Okay, I didn't see any fungus.
Look, I'm sure they have clean feet.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.874
There are probably rules
about that stuff.

28:40.952 --> 28:43.887
<i>[Squishing]</i>

28:43.955 --> 28:47.015
Okay, I admit it.
That's pretty disgusting.

28:47.092 --> 28:49.925
I saw a vending machine back there.
You want a soda?

28:49.994 --> 28:53.725
Excuse me?
To wash your mouth out.
You want a soda?

28:53.798 --> 28:55.823
Uh, that would be great.
Thanks.

28:57.969 --> 29:01.268
<i>Tome su tiempo.</i>
What?

29:01.339 --> 29:03.830
It means, "Take your time."

29:03.908 --> 29:05.842
Right.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.276
Natalie.

29:08.346 --> 29:10.337
Natalie, he's lying.

29:10.415 --> 29:14.875
This guy and the man I met last night
are not brothers.

29:14.953 --> 29:19.617
He just said "soda."
And Zwibell- Gruber-
whatever his name is- said "pop."

29:19.691 --> 29:22.626
And he was bilingual.
This guy doesn't speak a word of Spanish.

29:22.694 --> 29:24.685
They could not have grown up
in the same house.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.529
Okay, I need to find out
who he really is.

29:30.068 --> 29:32.502
Listen, can you break into
his car?

29:32.570 --> 29:35.698
Can I break into his car?
Yes, I can.
Okay.

29:35.774 --> 29:39.039
I'll keep him busy.
I'll take him to the bar.
I'll try to get him drunk.

29:39.110 --> 29:41.408
I'll loosen him up.
Maybe he'll make a misstep.

29:41.479 --> 29:43.709
W-Wait.
You're gonna drink?
Don't worry.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.773
I know what I'm doing.

29:47.385 --> 29:51.719
Hi. I'm sitting with
my friend over there.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.224
He would like a bottle
of your house white.
Okay.

29:54.292 --> 29:58.490
And, uh, do you have
any nonalcoholic wine?

29:58.563 --> 30:02.021
We have a very nice claret.
Zero alcohol.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.796
No alcohol at all?
That's what I said.

30:04.869 --> 30:08.236
I'll have that.
Could you put it in a carafe?

30:08.306 --> 30:12.709
Uh, you don't have to bring the bottle.
You got it.
We'll bring it over to you.

30:14.712 --> 30:17.044
Table 12 needs a bottle
of the house white...

30:17.115 --> 30:20.881
and a carafe of that claret.

30:20.952 --> 30:23.250
You got it.

30:23.321 --> 30:27.451
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.

30:27.525 --> 30:31.188
I do appreciate you
taking such an interest, Mr. Monk.

30:31.262 --> 30:33.924
Uh, well,
I have a brother too.

30:33.998 --> 30:37.832
I'd be worried sick
if anything happened to him.

30:39.938 --> 30:42.566
So, to your brother.

30:42.640 --> 30:45.666
Wherever the hell he is.

30:57.288 --> 31:01.554
Thirsty boy.
Catch me if you can.

31:06.030 --> 31:10.262
<i>Do you have a lot of friends?</i>
<i>I'll bet you do.</i>

31:10.335 --> 31:15.068
[Slurring]
Sometimes I turn on the TV,

31:15.139 --> 31:18.631
and I turn the sound way down.

31:18.710 --> 31:23.010
Mmm. I pretend that
they're talkin' to me.

31:23.081 --> 31:25.072
That everybody likes me.

31:26.951 --> 31:30.387
"Adrian, welcome back.

31:30.455 --> 31:34.289
Oh, we're so happy to see you.
We are so happy to see you."

31:36.828 --> 31:38.819
I'll bet you have a lot of friends.

31:46.871 --> 31:48.896
You look like a moose.

31:48.973 --> 31:50.907
[Laughing]
You do.

31:50.975 --> 31:53.068
I'm gonna call you...

31:53.144 --> 31:57.706
Mr. Look-Like-a-Moose.

31:57.782 --> 32:01.718
Look-Like-a-Moose.
[Laughing]

32:01.786 --> 32:06.189
So about your brother.
I'm sorry about the moose thing.

32:06.257 --> 32:09.055
Hey, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait. First, listen.

32:09.127 --> 32:11.561
What song is this?

32:11.629 --> 32:16.032

32:27.946 --> 32:29.846
<i>Al Nicoletto?</i>

32:38.656 --> 32:40.647
Captain Stottlemeyer, please.
It's important.

32:40.725 --> 32:43.717
[Mumbling]
Maybe you've had enough,
Mr. Monk.

32:43.795 --> 32:48.494
No. No, no, no, no.
I'm- I'm fine.

32:48.566 --> 32:50.500
I'm fine. Mmm.

32:50.568 --> 32:56.302
Isn't this great?
Just a couple of guys
sittin' in a revolving restaurant.

32:56.374 --> 32:58.501
Ah, I love that.

32:58.576 --> 33:00.874
[Panting]
Hey. Mr. Monk.

33:00.945 --> 33:04.142
Can I just talk to you
for a second in private?
[Laughing]

33:04.215 --> 33:06.911
<i>[Natalie Laughing]</i>
<i>Missed it.</i>

33:06.985 --> 33:09.249

33:09.320 --> 33:11.914
[Muttering]
All right.

33:14.592 --> 33:18.187
You're drunk.
No way. It's al-
It's nonalcoholic.

33:18.262 --> 33:20.492

I want him! Look!

33:24.469 --> 33:27.632
I'm winking.

33:27.705 --> 33:31.266
Okay, Mr. Monk, listen to me.
You were right. His name isn't Gruber.
It's Al NicolettoJr.

33:31.342 --> 33:35.108
He has five arrests.
No convictions.
He's a contract killer.

33:35.179 --> 33:37.670
Al, is this true?

33:41.252 --> 33:44.653
Yes or no, is this true?

33:47.558 --> 33:50.083
[Monk Mumbling]
[Natalie]
I already called the police.

33:50.161 --> 33:53.358
They're on their way,
so don't do anything stupid.
Don't you do anything stupid.

33:53.431 --> 33:55.365
And so it is agreed!

33:55.433 --> 33:59.597
And let the word go forth
that nobody will do anything stupid.

33:59.670 --> 34:02.195
Let's go. Let's go.
What are you doing?
Oh, you'll thank me later.

34:02.273 --> 34:04.707

With what?

34:10.114 --> 34:11.547

A bottle!

34:11.616 --> 34:16.018

Ben Gruber's partner was found
shot to death in his hotel room
in New York City five days ago.

34:48.052 --> 34:51.487
Now, I'm betting that
those bullets match this gun.

Nope.

40:00.364 --> 40:02.298
[Sighs]
What is it?

40:02.366 --> 40:05.699
What is what?
<i>This is their new wine.</i>
<i>They bottle it next door.</i>

40:05.770 --> 40:09.706
But it has this funky, weird aftertaste,
and I cannot put my finger on it.

40:09.774 --> 40:12.902
Here.
[Sniffs]

40:13.911 --> 40:16.573
It smells like Aqua Velva.

40:16.647 --> 40:19.275
Oh, my God.
<i>[Snoring Continues]</i>

40:19.350 --> 40:22.979
Oh, my God.
It's Aqua Velva.

40:24.155 --> 40:26.282
It's Aqua Velva.

40:26.357 --> 40:28.291
[Mutters]
It's Aqua Velva.

40:28.359 --> 40:30.418
[Chattering]

40:43.441 --> 40:46.274
[LaCoste]
It was the old lady's idea!

40:47.745 --> 40:49.713
<i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>What's gonna happen to them?</i>

40:49.780 --> 40:53.773
<i>[Stottlemeyer]</i>
<i>They didn't kill anybody,</i>
<i>so they'll probably be home soon.</i>

40:55.586 --> 40:58.646
Uh, he's a real party animal.
[Laughs]

40:58.722 --> 41:03.318
Okay. You drive safely, Natalie.

41:03.394 --> 41:06.454
We'll see you around campus.
Thank you, Captain.
I will.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.168
Happy anniversary, Adrian.

41:13.237 --> 41:16.070
Sorry I didn't believe you.
