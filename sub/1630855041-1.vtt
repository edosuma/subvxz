WEBVTT

00:57.933 --> 00:59.268
And there's his little foot.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.104
Any pain?

01:02.104 --> 01:04.105
All right, well,
that's telling us something.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.957
All right,
let's help get you two pregnant.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.587
There's her little foot.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.548
Any pain?

01:32.759 --> 01:34.011
I want pudding!

01:34.887 --> 01:37.306
Did somebody say "corn puddin'"?

01:38.098 --> 01:40.934
No, nobody said "corn puddin'."

01:41.894 --> 01:43.979
Right. Yes, I know that.

01:44.813 --> 01:48.275
Yes, I'm sorry. I-- Sorry.

01:49.276 --> 01:52.362
Dr. Skinner,
you said you'd fix my son's knee.

01:52.362 --> 01:55.073
Well, what do you say now?
Does that look like it's fixed?

01:55.073 --> 01:57.534
- Hank, we talked about this...
- Oh, no.

01:57.534 --> 02:01.496
...and I told you that there's only
a 50% chance surgery would help.

01:57.618 --> 02:01.496
...and I told you that there's only
a 50% chance surgery would help.

02:01.496 --> 02:04.374
Tell it to the judge,
'cause I'm suing your ass.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.294
You're going to jail. Doctor jail.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.252
Okay.

02:09.253 --> 02:10.380
That's the foot.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.548
There's two of 'em.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.051
Any pain?

02:14.051 --> 02:17.846
- Hello, Melissa!
- Hi, Mrs. Sliwinski.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.848
How are you?
I haven't seen you in a while.

02:19.848 --> 02:23.435
I've been in California,
visiting the grandkids.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.103
One of them is gay now.

02:26.230 --> 02:30.275
- Great.
- So, it looks like you've got good news.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.320
Is it a girl or a boy?

02:35.322 --> 02:37.741
Neither. No, I'm not pregnant, actually.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.493
But we are trying.

02:41.703 --> 02:42.871
Well, I--

02:42.871 --> 02:44.039
It's okay.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.209
Yes, well-- Have a good walk!

03:07.521 --> 03:08.564
What's wrong?

03:10.649 --> 03:11.650
I don't know.

03:12.276 --> 03:18.574
I just-- It feels like
we should be happier, you know?

03:23.412 --> 03:24.997
That's the foot.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.209
That's the foot.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.295
That's the foot.

03:31.295 --> 03:32.838
That's the foot.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.967
Unfortunately,
this cycle was not successful.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.387
But we can always try again if you want.

03:44.641 --> 03:45.893
<i>Looking ahead...</i>

03:48.478 --> 03:50.814
<i>We can expect temperatures in the high...</i>

03:59.740 --> 04:00.741
Hey.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.369
So I was thinking,

04:05.621 --> 04:08.207
and I know this sounds crazy
but what if we--

04:08.207 --> 04:10.709
- Yes.
- Yes?

04:14.463 --> 04:17.798
I really hope we don't
run into anyone out here. We look insane.

04:17.798 --> 04:19.091
Maybe we are insane.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.305
I feel like this is around
where we saw the bridge.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.600
Oh, yes! I think I remember this tree.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.979
You remember this tree?
From two years ago?

04:32.064 --> 04:33.482
I just really wanna find it.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.026
No, I-- Don't worry, we will find it.
All right.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.570
I got a really good feeling...

04:40.572 --> 04:41.657
about this direction.

04:42.574 --> 04:45.827
- Totally. Yes. Me too. Yep.
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.873
Maybe we're not supposed to find it again.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.918
Maybe it's one of those places
that you only go once and never return.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.336
Like SoulCycle.

04:54.336 --> 04:59.174
Not gonna lie, I am seriously questioning
our wardrobe choice right now.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.261
Yeah. But don't give up.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.931
Yes! That's the Schmigadoon spirit!

05:08.851 --> 05:09.977
We're never gonna find it.

05:11.270 --> 05:13.564
Schmigadoon, where are you?

05:22.406 --> 05:24.324
We should head back before it gets dark.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.179
What was that?

05:45.721 --> 05:46.722
Damn it.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.099
Yep.

05:50.726 --> 05:53.812
Flat tire. Perfect.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.689
Well, we've got a spare, right?

05:55.689 --> 05:58.483
I don't know. I'm not a car guy.
You know that. I--

05:58.483 --> 06:00.360
You don't have to be a car guy

05:58.567 --> 06:00.360
You don't have to be a car guy

06:00.360 --> 06:01.987
- to know if we have a spare.
- Wait.

06:03.197 --> 06:04.239
What's that?

06:05.115 --> 06:08.827
Sounds like an organ. It's music.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.871
It's music.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.623
Okay, let's not get too excited,
all right?

06:12.623 --> 06:14.625
- But it's music! Come on!
- Yeah. Wh-- Yes.

06:16.793 --> 06:17.961
We made it!

06:19.213 --> 06:20.422
"Schmicago"?

06:29.139 --> 06:34.770
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

06:34.770 --> 06:35.896
What the--

06:36.980 --> 06:40.234
<i>If your life is a bore</i>

06:40.234 --> 06:44.029
<i>And it's left you wanting more</i>

06:44.029 --> 06:46.281
<i>Leave your fancy degrees</i>

06:46.281 --> 06:48.283
<i>And your jobs and your cheese</i>

06:48.283 --> 06:51.286
<i>It's time to change your point of view</i>

06:51.828 --> 06:53.413

06:53.413 --> 06:56.208
<i>There's a world to explore</i>

06:56.208 --> 07:00.003
<i>With a thrill behind each door</i>

06:56.291 --> 07:00.003
<i>With a thrill behind each door</i>

07:00.003 --> 07:02.172
<i>We got song, we got dance</i>

07:02.172 --> 07:04.258
<i>Lots of sex, no romance</i>

07:04.258 --> 07:08.512
<i>We've got it all and just for you</i>

07:08.512 --> 07:12.558
<i>Welcome to Schmicago</i>

07:12.558 --> 07:16.770
<i>Our fantastical farrago</i>

07:16.770 --> 07:20.524
<i>Mystery and magic
Endings that are tragic</i>

07:21.108 --> 07:24.152
<i>Welcome to</i>

07:24.152 --> 07:28.323
<i>Schmicago</i>

07:28.323 --> 07:32.661
<i>Schmicago</i>

07:33.829 --> 07:36.456
It's the mayor. Hey, Mr. Mayor!

07:36.456 --> 07:38.166
I don't think that's the mayor.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.251
Honey, of course it is.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.336
Mr. Mayor, it's Josh and Melissa.
We're back!

07:41.336 --> 07:43.755
Stop it! Would you wave hello
to Sutton Foster in The Music Man

07:43.755 --> 07:46.091
because you remember her
from Thoroughly Modern Millie?

07:47.009 --> 07:48.343
I'm guessing no?

07:48.343 --> 07:52.222
This is not Schmigadoon.
This is Schmicago.

07:52.222 --> 07:56.310
Which means that is not the mayor.
It's someone else.

07:56.935 --> 08:00.272
<i>Dreams of fame on the stage</i>

08:00.272 --> 08:04.234
<i>And revenge that's fueled by rage</i>

08:04.234 --> 08:06.195
<i>Women brimming with lust</i>

08:06.195 --> 08:08.197
<i>Men that you shouldn't trust</i>

08:08.197 --> 08:11.617
<i>And orphans that don't wanna die</i>

08:11.617 --> 08:13.160
<i>Schmig-a-dee-yi</i>

08:13.160 --> 08:15.746
<i>Quest for meaning in life</i>

08:16.330 --> 08:19.958
<i>And an end to all this strife</i>

08:19.958 --> 08:22.127
<i>Systems running on greed</i>

08:22.127 --> 08:24.171
<i>And good guys who succeed</i>

08:24.171 --> 08:27.799
<i>And also someone's gonna fry</i>

08:28.967 --> 08:32.136
<i>Welcome to Schmicago</i>

08:32.136 --> 08:35.599

08:57.037 --> 08:58.497
- Okay.
- I'm really into this.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.874
- Yeah. Rein it in, pal. Please.
- Okay.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.874
- Yeah. Rein it in, pal. Please.
- Okay.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.884
Peas and carrots.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.011
Okay, what? I'm sorry.
Can you all not talk at once, please?

09:13.011 --> 09:15.222
- Because we can't understand you.
- We're trying to understand--

<i>Welcome to Schmicago</i>

09:59.224 --> 10:02.603
Thank you!

10:02.603 --> 10:03.854
- So we-- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:03.854 --> 10:06.440
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
You're too kind.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.858
No, really, thank you.

10:07.858 --> 10:14.239
For this evening's diversion,
we present the tale of Josh and Melissa!

10:16.700 --> 10:22.456
The story of a typical married couple in
the midst of a typical existential crisis.

10:22.456 --> 10:26.251
Here on a quest
for the most elusive of treasures.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.545
Happiness.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.088
Who is he talking to?

10:30.088 --> 10:31.340
S-- At one point,

10:31.340 --> 10:34.718
a lot of musicals had narrators.
You know, like, instead of a story.

10:34.718 --> 10:35.844
All right.

10:36.637 --> 10:37.971
I'm so sorry. Go ahead.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.766
Oh, really? Do I have your permission?

10:40.766 --> 10:42.601
Uh-oh. He's peppery.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.770
No, don't piss off the narrator.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.899
Josh and Melissa attempted to find
the answer by returning to Schmigadoon,

10:48.899 --> 10:54.655
but as we all know,
you can never return to Schmigadoon.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.823
So now our heroes,

10:56.823 --> 11:02.120
lost and disoriented and disappointed,

10:56.907 --> 11:02.120
lost and disoriented and disappointed,

11:02.663 --> 11:07.751
enter the city of Schmicago,
looking for a place to stay.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.926
So clearly we're in the next era
of musicals here.

11:15.926 --> 11:18.178
Chicago, Cabaret, Pippin.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.680
Great. I haven't seen any of 'em.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.391
I'm actually
less familiar with these shows too.

11:22.391 --> 11:25.143
'Cause I'm more into, like,
the earlier, happier ones, you know?

11:25.894 --> 11:28.272
Probably because of
a bad experience I had when I was eight.

11:28.272 --> 11:29.898
My dad took me to Sweeney Todd.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.530
We left early.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.448
But I do know that generally

11:38.448 --> 11:43.912
these musicals are darker with more sex
and violence and imperfect rhymes.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.372
Imperfect rhymes?

11:45.372 --> 11:49.293
Yeah. You know, like,
when you rhyme "time" with "fine."

11:49.293 --> 11:51.253
Oh, well, come on.
That doesn't really matter.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.796
It matters a lot.

11:52.796 --> 11:56.383
Yes, it does. I can see that now.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.094
Look. Hotel Schmicago.

11:59.595 --> 12:00.554
Maybe we should stay here.

12:01.930 --> 12:02.806
What?

12:03.390 --> 12:04.516
You sure you wanna stay?

12:04.516 --> 12:05.851
You don't?

12:05.851 --> 12:07.603
I don't know. It's just--

12:08.854 --> 12:11.398
I wanted Schmigadoon, you know?

12:11.398 --> 12:14.860
A place with happy people
and bright colors

12:14.860 --> 12:19.323
and songs about falling in love
and food. Not this.

12:19.323 --> 12:23.160
Okay. But still, we're in a magical land.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.329
I mean, we made it.

12:25.329 --> 12:28.290
And to be honest, I'm really vibing more
with this place, you know?

12:28.290 --> 12:31.293
It's edgy, like me.

12:35.214 --> 12:37.466
Look, we've got true love.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.134
We can leave whenever we want.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.178
Let's just stay the night

12:41.178 --> 12:45.641
and if you still don't like it,
we can go home tomorrow. Okay?

12:47.434 --> 12:48.602
- Okay.
- Thank you.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.187
But if this is about all the T & A...

12:50.187 --> 12:53.232
Hey, you have got the only T I wanna A.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.068
Yeah, that did not work.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.779
- Forget I said it.
- I wish I could.

13:09.206 --> 13:10.999
Hello. Hey.

13:13.752 --> 13:14.753
Hey.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.713
Wow. Hey there.

13:17.381 --> 13:21.885
Extremely blond person that I've just met.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.388
We'd like a room, please.

13:24.388 --> 13:25.764
We're from out of town.

13:26.390 --> 13:27.683
No kidding.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.769
It's 50 cents an hour, cash.

13:31.395 --> 13:32.437
No.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.774
We're actually spending the night.
We need it for the whole night.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.568
Three dollars, cash.

13:37.568 --> 13:39.403
See? I was right to get those singles.

13:39.403 --> 13:40.487
You're very smart.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.530
There you are.

13:42.114 --> 13:44.950
So, you two want a girl?

13:47.995 --> 13:50.122
You need my help to answer that question?

13:50.622 --> 13:54.543
No. I just-- No, thank you.

13:54.543 --> 13:56.461
Really not interested in a three-way.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.840
It's been hard enough to find one person
that I wanna sleep with.

14:00.966 --> 14:01.967
But she found him.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.845
We're married. Just over a year now.

14:05.554 --> 14:08.640
I'll drink to that!

14:08.640 --> 14:10.934
Checkout is 10:00 a.m. sharp.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.104
Thank you.

14:15.606 --> 14:16.815
Have a nice evening.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.449
All right. Yeah.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.534
I mean, it'll be fun. It's an adventure.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.411
Adventure?

14:29.411 --> 14:33.332
This is like that season
of American Horror Story I gave up on.

14:34.458 --> 14:38.086
Well, I don't know about you,
but I am ready to hit the...

14:42.382 --> 14:43.425
hay.

14:48.764 --> 14:52.768
Yeah. Maybe we'll just take turns
sleeping standing up.

14:52.768 --> 14:55.812
Sorry, have you got a cigarette, darlings?
I'm simply desperate.

14:58.607 --> 15:00.108
You must be new.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.694
Yes, well, we are always in and out
of each other's rooms here, darlings.

15:02.694 --> 15:04.655
We can hardly keep track
of who sleeps where.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.823
I'm Jenny. Jenny Banks.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.992
I'm Melissa. This is Josh.

15:08.992 --> 15:12.162
I simply adore your outfits.
They're just marvelous.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.039
What do you think of mine?

15:14.540 --> 15:16.708
It was a gift from one
of my older gentleman friends.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.253
I'm the most scandalous gold digger, darlings.

15:19.837 --> 15:21.463
Isn't it just deliciously decadent?

15:21.463 --> 15:22.548
I don't--

15:23.215 --> 15:27.719
We are going to become
the best of chums. I just know it.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.596
And I have the most spectacular
people instincts.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.806
I'm quite literally never wrong.

15:30.806 --> 15:33.851
Madam Frau says that
it's because I'm an old soul.

15:33.851 --> 15:36.895
And she should know. I mean,
she's practically 50, the old battle-ax.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.480
Fifty's not that old.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.400
How long were you two planning on staying?
I hope it's terribly long.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.903
We are-- No, we are not sure.

15:44.903 --> 15:47.573
Oh, no! But you simply must stay forever.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.992
We're going to have the most
marvelous time together, the three of us.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.870
In fact, you must come to see me perform
at the club tonight.

15:52.870 --> 15:55.414
I have a brand-new number,
and it's going to be just fabulous.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.749
I'll just die if you don't come.
Promise me you're going to come.

15:57.749 --> 15:58.876
Swear on your lives.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.252
- Just say yes.
- Sure, we'll be there.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.252
- Just say yes.
- Sure, we'll be there.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.630
You are little dears. The both of you.

16:04.798 --> 16:08.677
Okay, I will see you tonight. Au revoir.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.514
I forgot.
Do you have a cigarette, darling?

16:12.514 --> 16:14.099
- Nope.
- Sorry.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.602
And, you know, actually,
as a singer, you shouldn't--

16:16.602 --> 16:18.687
See you tonight. Tschüss.

16:19.438 --> 16:21.690
There's somebody else we don't know
from Schmigadoon.

16:22.941 --> 16:26.695
Are you joking? That was Betsy.

16:27.613 --> 16:28.655
What?

16:29.573 --> 16:32.993
That was Betsy.
She just changed her hair color.

16:34.119 --> 16:35.287
Are you sure?

16:37.456 --> 16:39.499
How are men in charge of anything?

16:39.499 --> 16:42.377
KRATT KLUBB

16:48.759 --> 16:49.593
'Kay.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.901
- Fun crowd.
- Yeah.

17:20.958 --> 17:22.876
<i>Do we shock you?</i>

17:22.876 --> 17:25.628
<i>Make you ill at ease?</i>

17:25.628 --> 17:31.301
<i>Do we offend
Your tender sensibilities?</i>

17:31.301 --> 17:35.681
<i>There's no norm we won't transgress</i>

17:36.181 --> 17:40.602
<i>Look! There's a man
And he's wearing a dress</i>

17:42.145 --> 17:43.146
Yeah. I mean,

17:43.146 --> 17:45.148
I've literally seen every season
of Drag Race, so...

17:45.148 --> 17:46.275
Yeah, so...

17:46.775 --> 17:48.694
<i>Do we scare you?</i>

17:49.278 --> 17:51.446
<i>Are you too refined?</i>

17:51.446 --> 17:54.032
<i>I'm into boys and girls</i>

17:54.032 --> 17:56.326
<i>Does that just blow your mind?</i>

17:57.619 --> 18:01.331
<i>Other girls get thanked and tipped</i>

18:02.457 --> 18:06.378
<i>Us, we just like
To get spanked and whipped</i>

18:07.588 --> 18:09.423
I wonder if the meat loaf's any good.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.430
<i>Does that shock you?</i>

18:16.430 --> 18:18.348
<i>We hope it shocks you</i>

18:19.308 --> 18:23.937
<i>'Cause we're really putting
A lot of effort into it</i>

18:33.071 --> 18:35.282
<i>What do you think about this?</i>

18:35.282 --> 18:36.825
I've got a tattoo.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.035
- It's cool.
- Cool.

18:38.035 --> 18:40.287
<i>What do you think about that?</i>

18:40.287 --> 18:43.582
I've experienced an orgasm. A female one.

18:45.334 --> 18:47.252
<i>What do you think about?</i>

19:19.368 --> 19:20.786
<i>Does that shock you?</i>

19:21.620 --> 19:23.580
<i>We hope it shocks you</i>

19:24.081 --> 19:27.501
<i>'Cause we're really putting
A lot of effort</i>

19:30.003 --> 19:32.464
<i>Really putting a lot of effort</i>

19:34.967 --> 19:39.847
<i>Really putting a lot of effort
Really putting a lot of effort</i>

19:39.847 --> 19:44.226
<i>Really putting a lot of effort into it</i>

19:46.979 --> 19:52.526
<i>Danke! Danke! Danke! Merci! Gracias.</i>

19:52.526 --> 19:54.444
Ankthay ouyay.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.612
Emma?

19:56.780 --> 19:58.115
Her you recognize?

19:58.115 --> 19:59.616
- Interesting.
- Mel--

19:59.616 --> 20:05.080
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
to the Kratt Klubb.

19:59.700 --> 20:05.080
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
to the Kratt Klubb.

20:05.789 --> 20:08.417
Where you can escape all your troubles
out there

20:08.417 --> 20:14.381
and enjoy the delights
of our beautiful cabaret girls in here.

20:15.382 --> 20:19.678
Annie, Kate, Molly, Tessie,

20:20.345 --> 20:24.349
Pepper, Duffy and Elsie.

20:26.476 --> 20:30.647
Now go, change into something
less comfortable. Huh?

20:31.815 --> 20:33.442
Okay.

20:33.442 --> 20:37.613
You have to move. Now. Schnell.
This table is reserved for the owner.

20:37.613 --> 20:39.156
We didn't know that.

20:39.156 --> 20:41.074
No, please don't get up.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.577
I'm sorry, Mr. Kratt.
I was just moving them.

20:43.577 --> 20:44.953
Nonsense, Madam.

20:46.205 --> 20:49.875
I take it the two of you are new
to Schmicago.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.878
Yes. We just got in today actually.

20:52.878 --> 20:56.006
Then please join me as my guests.

20:56.590 --> 20:57.716
- N--
- Should we?

20:58.675 --> 21:02.429
- I guess the three of us can squeeze.
- Get around the leg there. So...

21:02.429 --> 21:04.389
That'll do, Madam Frau.

21:04.389 --> 21:05.682
Yes, Mr. Kratt.

21:05.682 --> 21:09.937
I must apologize.
Madam Frau can be a little overzealous.

21:09.937 --> 21:12.981
- She's fine. She's great, actually.
- I don't-- Yeah.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.234
Allow me to introduce myself.

21:18.737 --> 21:23.242
My name is Kratt. Octavius Kratt.

21:25.953 --> 21:27.913
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kratt.

21:27.913 --> 21:32.042
I'm Josh Skinner, and-- Okay.
This is my wife.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.794
- Melissa Gimble.
- Yeah.

21:35.003 --> 21:36.004
Delighted.

21:36.797 --> 21:39.591
Yes, and-- Wow. So you own this club?

21:39.591 --> 21:42.344
Yes. More of a hobby, really.

21:43.595 --> 21:45.848
My true passion is power.

21:46.723 --> 21:48.016
Electricity.

21:49.518 --> 21:52.145
Every single home and business
in Schmicago is powered

21:52.145 --> 21:54.106
by a Kratt generating station.

21:54.106 --> 21:55.107
- Wow.
- Wow.

21:55.107 --> 21:58.902
As I like to say, every single home
and business in Schmicago

21:58.902 --> 22:02.030
is powered by a Kratt generating station.

21:58.986 --> 22:02.030
is powered by a Kratt generating station.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.241
That's a good sentence.

22:05.075 --> 22:07.786
But I am also a great appreciator of art

22:08.912 --> 22:10.539
and beauty.

22:11.123 --> 22:17.337
Which is why I spend my evenings here
at the club. Which I own.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.131
- Yeah, right. Yeah.
- You said that. Yes.

22:19.131 --> 22:22.467
Do you have any theatrical aspirations,
my dear?

22:23.135 --> 22:27.389
I'm always on the lookout for new talent.

22:28.599 --> 22:30.434
Me? No. Oh, no.

22:30.434 --> 22:32.728
- I'm a doctor. An obstetrician.
- She's--

22:33.395 --> 22:34.479
Of course you are.

22:34.479 --> 22:37.482
- Really? Here too?
- I am so sorry.

22:39.443 --> 22:41.069
If you'll excuse me.

22:42.821 --> 22:44.948
I have to go powder my nose.

22:49.953 --> 22:51.038
He seems nice.

22:53.332 --> 22:54.625
<i>Meine Damen und Herren.</i>

22:54.625 --> 22:56.335
<i>Mesdames et messieurs.</i>

22:56.335 --> 22:59.046
Ladies and germs.

22:59.546 --> 23:03.634
I give you the beautiful, the charming,

23:04.134 --> 23:08.013
the international sensation, Jenny Banks!

23:08.013 --> 23:09.097
Hey!

23:18.482 --> 23:22.611
<i>Back when I was summering in Brussels</i>

23:22.611 --> 23:27.324
<i>I fell in love with Martin
And his muscles</i>

23:27.324 --> 23:31.828
<i>My heart got pumping
Every time he flexed</i>

23:32.996 --> 23:34.414
<i>It's fair to say</i>

23:34.414 --> 23:39.670
<i>That I was overcome by what came next</i>

23:40.170 --> 23:44.842
<i>Turns out
He wasn't all that strong in bed</i>

23:45.467 --> 23:48.804
<i>And that is when I turned to him
And said</i>

23:49.471 --> 23:53.433
<i>We've gone kaput</i>

23:54.643 --> 23:56.144
<i>Now we're kaput</i>

23:56.854 --> 24:01.608
<i>Once our desire burnt like a fire
But now there's nothing left but soot</i>

24:01.608 --> 24:06.655
<i>We had a laugh or two
But now the laughter is through</i>

24:06.655 --> 24:09.950
<i>My dear, I fear that we're kaput</i>

24:18.000 --> 24:21.378
<i>Once I took a lover up in Munich</i>

24:22.713 --> 24:26.800
<i>Who made my prior beau
Look like a eunuch</i>

24:26.800 --> 24:30.679
<i>Soon we were making romance
'Round the clock</i>

24:31.930 --> 24:38.145
<i>But soon, alas
I tired of his cockamamie talk</i>

24:39.104 --> 24:43.233
<i>You see
The man had nothing in his head</i>

24:44.026 --> 24:47.779
<i>And so one night
I'd had enough and said</i>

24:47.779 --> 24:53.702
<i>We've gone kaput</i>

24:54.578 --> 24:55.913
<i>Now we're kaput</i>

24:57.122 --> 24:59.166
<i>Your rear's sublime
But now it's time</i>

24:59.166 --> 25:01.210
<i>It got a visit from my foot</i>

24:59.249 --> 25:01.210
<i>It got a visit from my foot</i>

25:01.210 --> 25:06.048
<i>We had a fine affair
But please get out of mein hair</i>

25:06.048 --> 25:08.967
<i>My dear, I fear it's clear
That we're kaput</i>

25:09.468 --> 25:10.469
All right.

25:12.262 --> 25:15.891
<i>We've gone kaput</i>

25:15.891 --> 25:16.892
<i>We've gone kaput</i>

25:16.892 --> 25:18.227
<i>Now we're kaput</i>

25:18.227 --> 25:19.186
<i>Now we're kaput</i>

25:19.186 --> 25:23.273
<i>Once our desire burnt like a fire
But now there's nothing left but soot</i>

25:23.273 --> 25:27.819
<i>We had a fine affair
But please get out of mein hair</i>

25:27.819 --> 25:32.491
<i>My dear, I fear that we're kaput</i>

25:32.491 --> 25:33.784
<i>Kaput</i>

25:34.785 --> 25:35.911
<i>Kaput</i>

25:36.620 --> 25:37.913
<i>Kaput</i>

25:38.664 --> 25:39.665
<i>Kaput</i>

25:43.794 --> 25:44.837
Wow!

25:46.380 --> 25:48.715
So that's Betsy?

25:48.715 --> 25:50.634
- Okay. You stop.
- All right.

25:50.634 --> 25:54.680
I actually need to go powder my nose too.

25:56.265 --> 25:57.641
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

26:01.979 --> 26:02.980
What?

26:05.732 --> 26:06.733
Hello?

26:11.488 --> 26:15.701
N-- Okay. No.

26:17.786 --> 26:19.454
MEIN KAMPF

26:22.499 --> 26:23.709
Just the bathroom?

26:35.262 --> 26:38.265
Miss, can you hear me?

26:38.849 --> 26:42.186
Hey, Josh, we got-- What? What happened?

26:42.186 --> 26:44.688
What? No.
I just came in. I found her like--

26:44.688 --> 26:46.106
- Is she--
- She's dead.

26:48.192 --> 26:49.318
- Murder!
- No, wait!

26:49.318 --> 26:51.445
- We gotta get the hell out of here.
- Yes, but what about her?

26:51.445 --> 26:53.363
She's dead.
There's nothing else we can do for her.

26:53.363 --> 26:56.575
But you have blood on your hands
and someone just saw you.

26:56.575 --> 26:59.369
And this is not the kind of musical
I wanna be in.

26:59.369 --> 27:00.787
All right.

26:59.453 --> 27:00.787
All right.

27:06.418 --> 27:08.921
Oh, shit. What about the flat?
Can we drive on the rim?

27:08.921 --> 27:10.297
Again, not a car person.

27:10.297 --> 27:12.341
Just let's get across the bridge
and we'll figure it out.

27:12.341 --> 27:13.675
Hurry up!

27:13.675 --> 27:14.843
I'm hurrying!

27:14.843 --> 27:17.262
What-- Well, what's happening?
What is that?

27:17.262 --> 27:18.347
It's dead.

27:19.431 --> 27:20.682
Let's take a look here.

27:24.895 --> 27:25.896
What the hell?

27:25.896 --> 27:29.733
<i>Schmicago welcomes your return</i>

27:30.776 --> 27:34.363
<i>But it seems ye both
Have more to learn</i>

27:34.363 --> 27:38.534
<i>For though 'tis true ye
Found true love</i>

27:38.534 --> 27:41.787
<i>That isn't all ye have need of</i>

27:41.787 --> 27:42.829
Oh, God.

27:42.829 --> 27:46.625
<i>So now it's here
Your lives ye'll spend</i>

27:46.625 --> 27:48.710
<i>Until ye've made a...</i>

27:48.710 --> 27:49.795
What?

27:49.795 --> 27:53.090
<i>...happy end</i>

27:54.675 --> 27:57.094
- Wh-- No. Come back!
- No! Wha--

27:57.094 --> 27:59.471
- This--
- It's not helpful!

27:59.972 --> 28:01.223
Are you kidding me?

28:02.808 --> 28:05.352
"A happy end"? What does that even mean?

28:05.352 --> 28:09.273
I don't know. But what I do know
is I hate that freaking leprechaun.

28:09.273 --> 28:11.525
How are we supposed to
make a happy ending in this place?

28:11.525 --> 28:13.569
'Cause these musicals
don't have happy endings.

28:13.569 --> 28:15.737
And even if they did,
I hate to state the obvious,

28:15.737 --> 28:19.199
but we are not the people to orchestrate
anything involving happiness.

28:19.199 --> 28:20.784
- We're miserable.
- We're miserable.

28:21.952 --> 28:24.204
- Oh, no.
- We gotta get across this bridge.

28:24.204 --> 28:25.873
- But the leprechaun said--
- The cops are coming,

28:25.873 --> 28:28.500
and I literally have blood on my hands.
We have to try.

28:28.500 --> 28:31.545
Just-- I don't know. Think happy thoughts.

28:31.545 --> 28:33.255
I can't. That's why we're here.

28:34.256 --> 28:36.091
Okay, maybe if we tried smiling?

28:37.968 --> 28:39.511
Shit. Come on.

28:50.522 --> 28:51.523
Hands up!

28:53.108 --> 28:54.484
Don't move.

28:56.236 --> 28:57.237
Is that him?

28:58.488 --> 29:01.283
Josh Skinner, you're under arrest
for the murder of Elsie Vale.

29:01.283 --> 29:05.329
What? No, I didn't kill her.
I just found the body.

29:05.329 --> 29:07.247
This is crazy. He didn't do it.

29:07.247 --> 29:09.416
Sarge, look at this.

29:09.416 --> 29:11.543
- Why was that in our car?
- I have no idea.

29:11.543 --> 29:16.173
Well, well, well.
Looks like we found us a murder weapon.

29:16.173 --> 29:17.549
Okay, that is not mine.

29:17.549 --> 29:20.511
No, it's not. We are both very anti-gun.

29:20.511 --> 29:22.971
- Josh is actually afraid of guns.
- Well, I'm not afraid of them.

29:22.971 --> 29:24.473
My dad took you to the shooting range.

29:24.473 --> 29:27.559
I just was really surprised at how
loud it was, okay? It was super loud.

29:27.559 --> 29:29.811
- He was crying for a couple h--
- I was not crying.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.605
Quiet! Put him in the wagon.

29:32.147 --> 29:34.733
- Wait. No. Where are you taking him?
- Wait.

29:34.733 --> 29:37.277
Where he belongs. Jail.

29:38.278 --> 29:39.571
Josh!

29:48.080 --> 29:52.376
<i>Mystery and magic
Endings that are tragic</i>

29:52.376 --> 29:55.963
<i>Welcome to</i>

29:55.963 --> 30:02.427
<i>Schmicago</i>

29:56.046 --> 30:02.427
<i>Schmicago</i>

30:10.185 --> 30:14.273
<i>We've gone kaput</i>

30:15.399 --> 30:17.025
<i>Now we're kaput</i>

30:17.860 --> 30:22.447
<i>Once our desire burnt like a fire
But now there's nothing left but soot</i>

30:22.447 --> 30:27.452
<i>We had a laugh or two
But now the laughter is through</i>

30:27.452 --> 30:30.622
<i>My dear, I fear that we're kaput</i>

30:36.670 --> 30:40.257
<i>Once I took a lover up in Munich</i>

30:41.175 --> 30:45.179
<i>Who made my prior beau
Look like a eunuch</i>

30:45.846 --> 30:49.349
<i>Soon we were making romance
'Round the clock</i>

30:50.475 --> 30:57.232
<i>But soon, alas
I tired of his cockamamie talk</i>

30:57.733 --> 31:01.570
<i>You see
The man had nothing in his head</i>

31:02.779 --> 31:06.825
<i>And so one night
I'd had enough and said</i>

31:06.825 --> 31:10.454
<i>We've gone kaput</i>

31:10.454 --> 31:11.538
<i>We've gone kaput</i>

31:11.538 --> 31:13.665
- Now we're kaput
- Now we're kaput

31:13.665 --> 31:17.669
<i>Once our desire burnt like a fire
But now there's nothing left but soot</i>

31:17.669 --> 31:19.671
<i>We had a fine affair</i>

31:19.671 --> 31:22.216
<i>But please get out of mein hair</i>

31:22.216 --> 31:27.137
<i>My dear, I fear that we're kaput</i>

31:27.137 --> 31:28.222
<i>Kaput</i>
