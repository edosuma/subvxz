00:00.551 --> 00:02.102
<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:02.127 --> 00:03.694
<i>Sam and Mercedes are dating</i>
<i>and they're actually living</i>

00:03.729 --> 00:05.396
<i>together after Sam tried couch</i>
<i>surfing at Rachel and Kurt's</i>

00:05.430 --> 00:06.797
<i>and they made him move out.</i>

00:06.832 --> 00:08.599
You've been sitting there
since I left this morning.

00:08.633 --> 00:10.434
<i>Blaine moved out, too,</i>
<i>even though he and Kurt</i>

00:10.435 --> 00:11.602
<i>are still together</i>
<i>and still getting married,</i>

00:11.636 --> 00:13.137
<i>but still they decided</i>
<i>it'd be better</i>

00:13.171 --> 00:15.139
<i>if they were living apart.</i>
<i>Artie's in New York, too,</i>

00:15.173 --> 00:17.133
<i>and he used to date Tina</i>
<i>then Brittany then Kitty,</i>

00:17.142 --> 00:18.409
<i>but now he's single</i>
<i>and on the prowl</i>

00:18.443 --> 00:19.744
<i>at film school in Brooklyn.</i>

00:19.778 --> 00:22.346
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:23.599 --> 00:25.333
<i>America is under attack.</i>

00:25.367 --> 00:27.034
<i>Who's about to</i>
<i>sneak up to Lady Liberty</i>

00:27.069 --> 00:29.604
<i>and punch her in the face?</i>
<i>Is it the marauding Hun</i>

00:29.638 --> 00:31.038
<i>blitzkrieging across Europe?</i>

00:31.073 --> 00:33.074
<i>Is it the Imperial Navy,</i>
<i>who attacked our boys</i>

00:33.108 --> 00:34.342
<i>at Pearl Harbor?</i>
<i>No.</i>

00:34.376 --> 00:36.410
<i>America faces a much more</i>

00:36.445 --> 00:38.980
<i>insidious threat: STDs!</i>

00:39.014 --> 00:40.414
<i> Hey, boys.</i>

00:40.449 --> 00:41.849
<i>Did you know there's an</i>
<i>epidemic in this country?</i>

00:41.884 --> 00:44.952
<i>Well, there is. And it could</i>
<i>be hiding in your trousers.</i>

00:44.987 --> 00:46.520
<i>Do you know what an STD is?</i>

00:46.555 --> 00:49.257
<i>It's a sexually</i>
<i>transmitted disease.</i>

00:49.291 --> 00:51.125
<i>And the numbers</i>
<i>are skyrocketing.</i>

00:51.159 --> 00:53.079
<i>And don't think you're not</i>
<i>in danger just because</i>

00:53.095 --> 00:54.462
<i>you're a handsome idiot,</i>

00:54.496 --> 00:56.364
<i>a debonair homosexual,</i>

00:56.398 --> 00:57.899
<i>a hapless invalid,</i>

00:57.933 --> 00:59.734
<i>or a strapping male soprano.</i>

00:59.768 --> 01:02.436
<i>I'll bet you'd like to know</i>
<i>how you can stop this epidemic</i>

01:02.471 --> 01:05.072
<i>in its tracks and give</i>
<i>Lady Liberty back her dignity.</i>

01:05.107 --> 01:06.574
<i>Why, get tested, of course.</i>

01:06.608 --> 01:09.076
<i>Just say, "I think I may</i>
<i>have the clap, please."</i>

01:09.111 --> 01:10.912
<i>And you're well on your way</i>

01:10.946 --> 01:12.847
<i>to making this country</i>
<i>shipshape again.</i>

01:12.881 --> 01:16.450
Hey, boys. Do you know that an
untreated STD can lead to...

01:16.485 --> 01:17.952
- Blindness!
- Sterility!

01:17.986 --> 01:19.320
- Insanity?
- Even death.

01:19.354 --> 01:21.489
Do you want to end up
in an iron lung?

01:21.523 --> 01:22.757
No, sir!

01:22.791 --> 01:24.158
Attaboy, soldier.

01:24.193 --> 01:26.093
<i>Feels good, doesn't it, boys?</i>

01:26.128 --> 01:27.461
And how.

01:27.496 --> 01:30.164
<i>Remember, get tested for STD.</i>

01:30.199 --> 01:32.800
<i>Or America will end up R.I.P.</i>

<i> I couldn't agree with</i>
<i>you more, Happy Tourist Family.</i>

01:43.111 --> 01:44.445
<i>I love New York.</i>

01:44.479 --> 01:45.947
<i>The culture,</i>

01:45.981 --> 01:47.448
<i>the diversity...</i>

01:47.483 --> 01:50.084
<i>and, oh, the food.</i>

01:50.118 --> 01:52.186
Hey. You want
the regular, Blaine?

01:52.221 --> 01:53.421
You know it, Aristotle.

01:55.374 --> 01:57.334
<i>Lima's idea</i>
<i>of international cuisine</i>

01:57.359 --> 01:59.927
<i>is a Taco Bell and Breadstix.</i>

01:59.962 --> 02:01.596
<i>But in NYC,</i>

02:01.630 --> 02:03.798
<i>it's a United Nations</i>
<i>of restaurants.</i>

02:03.832 --> 02:05.867
<i>From Mexican to Mongolian,</i>

02:05.901 --> 02:07.368
<i>Hungarian to Honduran,</i>

02:07.402 --> 02:09.036
<i>Vietnamese to Viennese.</i>

02:09.071 --> 02:11.105
<i>And there's always room</i>

02:11.140 --> 02:13.641
<i>in the tum-tum</i>
<i>for my newest obsession:</i>

02:13.675 --> 02:16.177
<i>cronuts.</i>

02:16.211 --> 02:19.881
<i>If a croissant and a donut</i>
<i>made sweet, sweet love,</i>

02:19.915 --> 02:21.983
<i>their baby would be a cronut,</i>

02:22.017 --> 02:24.485
<i>a flaky,</i>
<i>yet buoyant sugar-kissed</i>

02:24.520 --> 02:26.053
<i>pastry of perfection.</i>

02:26.088 --> 02:27.955
<i>It's sort of become a habit</i>

02:27.990 --> 02:30.625
<i>that I enjoy a cronut</i>
<i>or two on the way to school.</i>

02:30.659 --> 02:32.193
<i>And maybe on the way back home.</i>

02:32.227 --> 02:33.561
<i>Okay, I'm addicted to them.</i>

02:33.595 --> 02:35.863
<i>But they go great</i>
<i>with everything,</i>

02:35.898 --> 02:38.533
<i>especially the breakfast in bed</i>

02:38.567 --> 02:40.368
<i>that I serve Kurt</i>
<i>every Sunday morning.</i>

02:40.402 --> 02:41.669
...83...

02:41.703 --> 02:46.707
<i>Yes, the Big Apple</i>
<i>is delicious, and I plan</i>

02:46.742 --> 02:48.609
<i>on savoring every bite.</i>

02:52.381 --> 02:53.347
Come on,

02:53.382 --> 02:55.850

Could this be the...

03:09.498 --> 03:12.200
Could it be the Freshman 15?

03:16.001 --> 03:17.881
<i>Frank Sinatra said it best.</i>

03:17.906 --> 03:20.074
<i>New York is my kind of town.</i>

03:20.109 --> 03:22.477
<i>Actually, I think</i>
<i>he was talking about Chicago,</i>

03:22.511 --> 03:23.711
<i>but I'm in New York now,</i>

03:23.746 --> 03:25.546
<i>and as Dorothy Gale</i>
<i>always said,</i>

03:25.581 --> 03:27.415
<i>there's no place like home.</i>

03:27.449 --> 03:29.417
<i>Except she was talking</i>
<i>about Kansas.</i>

03:29.451 --> 03:33.254
<i>Still, New York is just</i>
<i>so different from high school.</i>

03:33.288 --> 03:35.723
<i>At McKinley, no one wanted</i>
<i>anything to do with me</i>

03:35.758 --> 03:37.859
<i>because I was a nerd in</i>
<i>a wheelchair</i>

03:37.893 --> 03:39.927
<i>who tucked my sweaters</i>
<i>into my pleated khakis.</i>

03:39.962 --> 03:42.463
<i>But here,</i>
<i>I do exactly the same thing,</i>

03:42.498 --> 03:43.965
<i>and everyone thinks it's cool.</i>

03:43.999 --> 03:46.134
Hey, Artie. Look.

03:46.168 --> 03:47.702
<i>In high school,</i>

03:47.736 --> 03:49.570
<i>I had to beg girls</i>
<i>to go out with me.</i>

03:49.605 --> 03:51.205
<i>Here, I'm lady bait.</i>

03:51.240 --> 03:53.408
<i>I'm like the pied piper</i>
<i>of coed trim.</i>

03:53.442 --> 03:55.322
<i>A year ago,</i>
<i>I was dating one girl</i>

03:55.344 --> 03:56.465
<i>and considered myself lucky.</i>

03:56.478 --> 03:58.546
<i>Now, I'm dating three.</i>

03:58.580 --> 03:59.380
Hi, Artie.

03:59.415 --> 04:00.715
Hey, Vanessa.

04:00.749 --> 04:04.052
I'm Vanessa,
and I'm so hot for Godard.

04:04.086 --> 04:06.247
I made my parents throw
a French New Wave party

04:06.255 --> 04:07.588
for my sixth birthday.

04:07.623 --> 04:10.591
<i>When I saw Artie's experimental</i>
<i>short film,</i>

04:10.626 --> 04:12.093
Rags the Homeless Clown,

04:12.127 --> 04:14.729
I was like, "Oh, yes,
I will sleep with him."

04:14.763 --> 04:16.064
Hey, Jess.

04:16.098 --> 04:17.964
Are we on for <i> The Fly</i>
at Film Forum tonight?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.666
You bet your sweet ass we are.

04:19.702 --> 04:21.269
Yeah, I have a thing
for wheelchairs.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.937
<i>Crash</i> is the greatest
film ever made,

04:22.971 --> 04:24.639
and I'm not talking
about that Paul Haggis

04:24.673 --> 04:25.907
Oscar-bait train wreck.

04:25.941 --> 04:27.421
That film could've used
a train wreck.

04:27.443 --> 04:28.776
I'm talking Cronenberg.

04:28.811 --> 04:30.144
Hey, Julie.

04:30.179 --> 04:31.245
Sorry I'm late.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.915
<i>And then there's Julie.</i>

04:33.949 --> 04:36.384
<i>She's the one I've really</i>
<i>got my heart set on.</i>

04:36.418 --> 04:37.752
I'm ready when you are.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.024
This is narration
for <i> Bags in the Wind,</i>

04:43.058 --> 04:45.626
a film by Artie Abrams,
take one.

04:45.661 --> 04:49.364
When a plastic bag gets
caught in the wind,

04:49.398 --> 04:51.966
does it feel sadness or hope?

04:52.001 --> 04:54.936
Does the plastic bag know
it is eternal?

04:54.970 --> 04:57.639
<i> She's smart,
funny, super talented,</i>

04:57.673 --> 04:59.107
<i>and everyone likes her.</i>

04:59.141 --> 05:00.541
<i>A year ago,</i>
<i>I would have been terrified</i>

05:00.576 --> 05:02.110
<i>to ask out a girl like her,</i>

05:02.144 --> 05:04.646
<i>but these days, I've learned</i>
<i>you just got to go for it.</i>

Great, Julie.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.576
I want to try it again,

07:14.610 --> 07:16.945
but this time
with a little more...

07:16.979 --> 07:18.613
twilight in your voice?

07:18.647 --> 07:20.014
Twilight.

07:20.049 --> 07:22.116
That's amazing direction, Artie.

07:22.151 --> 07:24.152
Listen, Julie,

07:24.186 --> 07:27.088
maybe we could go out sometime?

07:27.122 --> 07:28.256
Like on a date?

07:29.325 --> 07:31.626
I'd love to, Artie.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.962
It's just... I sort
of have a policy

07:33.996 --> 07:36.764
where I don't date anyone
that I'm working with.

07:36.799 --> 07:38.700
Oh, sure.

07:38.734 --> 07:40.368
Great. Take two.

07:42.571 --> 07:45.540
Stage combat
is not for the weak of heart.

07:45.574 --> 07:47.842
Our bodies are our weapons.

07:47.877 --> 07:50.378
And speaking of weapons,
check out the gun show.

07:50.412 --> 07:51.579
I finally hit puberty.

07:51.614 --> 07:52.881
I'm serious.

07:52.915 --> 07:54.149
Make a muscle.

07:55.651 --> 07:57.685
<i>I've got to hand it to Kurt.</i>

07:57.720 --> 07:59.254
<i>He's looking amazing</i>
<i>these days,</i>

07:59.288 --> 08:01.456
<i>and he deserves all</i>
<i>the attention he's getting.</i>

08:01.490 --> 08:04.659
<i>Still, I just can't help</i>
<i>but feel...</i>

08:04.693 --> 08:05.860
<i>What is it?</i>

08:05.895 --> 08:08.630
<i>Oh, just cut the crap, Blaine.</i>

08:08.664 --> 08:10.331
<i>I'm actually feeling</i>
<i>a little jealous.</i>

08:10.366 --> 08:12.700
<i>Back at McKinley, I'd be</i>
<i>the guy getting fawned over.</i>

08:12.735 --> 08:14.235
<i>I lifted; I boxed;</i>

08:14.270 --> 08:16.371
<i>I was in the Dalton Fight Club</i>
<i>for God's sake.</i>

08:16.405 --> 08:19.040
<i>And Kurt was, well, Kurt.</i>

08:19.074 --> 08:20.575
<i>Most of the time,</i>
<i>he was more comfortable</i>

08:20.609 --> 08:21.876
<i>hanging out with the girls.</i>

08:21.911 --> 08:23.778
<i>Like when the Glee Club</i>
<i>sang "Summer Nights,"</i>

08:23.813 --> 08:25.146
<i>he did the Rizzo part.</i>

08:25.181 --> 08:27.015
<i>But the winds have changed.</i>

08:27.049 --> 08:29.117
<i>There's a shift</i>
<i>in the power dynamic.</i>

08:29.151 --> 08:30.418
<i>Kurt's the hot shot now.</i>

08:30.453 --> 08:32.453
<i>And after what happened to him</i>
<i>a few weeks ago,</i>

08:32.488 --> 08:34.589
<i>a lot of people look at him</i>
<i>as a hero.</i>

08:34.623 --> 08:35.890
<i>He's leading man material.</i>

08:35.924 --> 08:37.158
<i>I've always known</i>
<i>he could be that,</i>

08:37.193 --> 08:38.326
<i>but most people didn't.</i>

08:38.360 --> 08:40.428
<i>I guess I'm just not used</i>
<i>to Kurt</i>

08:40.462 --> 08:42.630
<i>being seen as a sexual object.</i>

08:42.664 --> 08:44.732
<i>And to be completely honest,</i>

08:44.767 --> 08:46.568
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I'm comfortable with that.</i>

08:46.602 --> 08:47.735
Let's go, Cheese Puff.

08:57.480 --> 08:58.546
Time-out, okay?

08:58.581 --> 09:00.048
Time-out.

09:00.082 --> 09:02.317
I need to come up for air.
This sofa's killing my back.

09:02.351 --> 09:03.852
Well, actually, you know what,

09:03.886 --> 09:05.553
Blaine's not going to be home
for a couple hours,

09:05.588 --> 09:08.223
so if you wanted to
go lay down or...

09:08.257 --> 09:10.525
Sam, I think we need
to have a conversation.

09:10.559 --> 09:13.795
Okay.

09:13.829 --> 09:16.464
Things never got...

09:16.499 --> 09:19.234
too serious for us
back in high school

09:19.268 --> 09:20.535
for a number reasons,

09:20.569 --> 09:23.605
but the truth is, things haven't
gotten too serious

09:23.639 --> 09:25.907
for me with anyone.

09:27.543 --> 09:29.577
I'm a virgin.

09:29.612 --> 09:30.979
Oh.

09:31.013 --> 09:33.114
Okay.

09:34.283 --> 09:35.750
I'm not.

09:35.785 --> 09:36.985
Yeah, I got that.

09:37.019 --> 09:38.720
You know, and that's fine.

09:38.754 --> 09:41.756
We just,
we have different pasts,

09:41.791 --> 09:45.093
and different levels
of experience.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.215
I just,
I don't want to do anything

09:48.230 --> 09:50.098
until I know that I should.

09:51.100 --> 09:53.234
Hmm.

09:54.136 --> 09:56.137
Okay, well, uh,

09:56.172 --> 09:58.373
we can go as slow or as fast

09:58.407 --> 10:00.375
as you would like to.

10:00.409 --> 10:01.476
As long as we're together,

10:01.510 --> 10:02.631
you get to call the shots.

10:05.247 --> 10:08.349
You guys, look, you need
to help me find a clinic,

10:08.384 --> 10:10.318
preferably free.
Are you sick?

10:10.352 --> 10:11.419
Um, I don't think so.

10:11.454 --> 10:12.720
Then what do you
need a clinic for?

10:12.755 --> 10:16.057
To make sure that I'm
not, you know,<i> sick.</i>

10:16.092 --> 10:17.659
Okay, guys, look, I'm trying
to be a gentleman here,

10:17.693 --> 10:19.394
like, you know, Mercedes-wise.

10:19.428 --> 10:21.229
Look, and I want to get
an STD test

10:21.263 --> 10:23.598
just to make sure I have
a clean bill of health to,

10:23.632 --> 10:25.333
you know, ease her mind.

10:25.367 --> 10:27.469
Wait, you guys
haven't had sex yet?

10:27.503 --> 10:29.637
What's so shocking?
Okay, we just started dating.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.373
But you sleep in the same room.

10:31.407 --> 10:33.875
Well, I mean, I really like her,

10:33.909 --> 10:35.910
and I don't want
to mess things up, you know?

10:35.945 --> 10:37.612
We're taking it slow.

10:37.646 --> 10:38.747
Well, I, for one,

10:38.781 --> 10:40.749
think that's very,
uh, admirable

10:40.783 --> 10:42.450
and, uh, postmodern romantic.

10:42.485 --> 10:43.752
And if you need a free clinic,

10:43.786 --> 10:44.919
there's one
on 14th Street in Chelsea.

10:44.954 --> 10:46.321
Does it hurt?

10:46.355 --> 10:47.389
I mean, do they, like,

10:47.423 --> 10:48.923
stick your thing with anything?

10:48.958 --> 10:51.059
No, it's just, like,

10:51.093 --> 10:52.660
a blood and urine sample.
It's just quick and simple.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.129
If you're nervous about it,
I'll go with you. Yeah.

10:54.163 --> 10:56.431
Boys' day. That sounds fun.
Yeah, I mean,

10:56.465 --> 10:58.800
you know, we haven't been tested
since the whole Eli C debacle.

10:58.834 --> 11:00.201
I mean, not that we have
anything to worry about,

11:00.236 --> 11:01.403
but it would
be the responsible thing to do,

11:01.437 --> 11:02.558
for all of us to get tested.

11:02.571 --> 11:04.439
Even you, Artie.
What?

11:04.473 --> 11:06.041
Oh, I-I didn't order this.

11:06.075 --> 11:07.242
Oh, I-I whispered to her.

11:07.276 --> 11:08.777
It's my little gift
to you. Trust me,

11:08.811 --> 11:11.513
you and your crazy self-denial
dietary regimen will thank me

11:11.547 --> 11:13.782
once you have one sip of
this Frozen Hot Chocolate.

11:13.816 --> 11:15.183
All right, uh, one sip,

11:15.217 --> 11:16.778
then I'll thank you,
then I'll jog home.

11:16.786 --> 11:17.585
Cheers.

11:17.620 --> 11:18.987
Cheers, cheers.
Cheers.

11:19.021 --> 11:20.155
Cheers, cheers.
Oh, my God.

11:20.189 --> 11:21.756
Just have the whole thing.

11:21.791 --> 11:23.692
It's really good.

11:26.529 --> 11:27.996
Hello?

11:28.030 --> 11:30.532
Artie Abrams?

11:30.566 --> 11:33.068
Okay, I'll cut right
to the chase.

11:33.102 --> 11:36.404
You have tested positive
for chlamydia.

11:36.439 --> 11:38.406
What? You can't be serious.

11:38.441 --> 11:39.874
I haven't had any
of the symptoms.

11:39.909 --> 11:41.276
If I had,
I would've come in right away.

11:41.310 --> 11:42.811
Well, the test
came back positive,

11:42.845 --> 11:44.646
which means you're asymptomatic,
which is even worse

11:44.680 --> 11:46.648
because it means that you could
be spreading the disease

11:46.682 --> 11:47.782
without knowing it.

11:57.324 --> 11:59.804
That's what I call
a season finale.

11:59.829 --> 12:01.930
Sam, I can't keep watching
this show with you.

12:01.964 --> 12:04.532
Oh, come on, Blaine. Season seven of
<i>Arliss</i> is when it gets really good.

12:04.567 --> 12:07.007
Guys, I can't stand it anymore.
I have to tell you something.

12:07.470 --> 12:08.937
I have chlamydia.

12:08.971 --> 12:10.538
What? What? Oh, my God.

12:10.573 --> 12:12.073
Yeah, I know. Yeah,
Are you serious?

12:12.108 --> 12:13.675
The doctor called me
and said I tested positive.

12:13.709 --> 12:14.642
How is that possible?

12:14.677 --> 12:15.644
I don't know how.
Well,

12:15.678 --> 12:17.078
- do you wear condoms?
- No.

12:17.113 --> 12:18.146
Well, that would be how.

12:18.180 --> 12:19.881
Artie, are you kidding?!
The one time

12:19.915 --> 12:21.549
I bought some, I got nervous
because they were locked

12:21.584 --> 12:23.418
in a cabinet and the pharmacist
asked me which kind I liked

12:23.452 --> 12:25.353
and I panicked so then she gave
me these ones that were all...

12:25.388 --> 12:26.888
greasy and they smelled
like banana.

12:26.922 --> 12:28.556
It was like putting
on a-a tiny, greasy,

12:28.591 --> 12:29.891
banana-flavored wet suit.

12:29.925 --> 12:31.685
No, Artie, okay? That's...
There's no excuse.

12:31.694 --> 12:33.361
That is completely
irresponsible!

12:33.396 --> 12:34.896
You have to wear
one every time!

12:34.930 --> 12:37.299
Stop yelling. I'm sure
he feels bad enough.

12:37.333 --> 12:40.769
No, Blaine, this isn't okay.
Artie needs to be slut-shamed.

12:40.803 --> 12:43.438
- I'm slut-shaming you, Artie!
- You're lucky you just got chlamydia.

12:43.472 --> 12:44.906
I mean, you could've caught
something that can't be cured.

12:44.941 --> 12:45.874
Yeah, you could've
gotten somebody pregnant.

12:45.908 --> 12:47.029
Did you think about that?

12:47.043 --> 12:48.510
Slut! Slut shame!

12:48.544 --> 12:49.711
Well, I'm sure

12:49.745 --> 12:50.779
you're getting treated, right?

12:50.813 --> 12:52.580
Yes. I take antibiotics
for two weeks

12:52.615 --> 12:54.082
and then I go for a checkup
to make sure it's cured.

12:54.116 --> 12:56.451
You have to tell the girl you slept with.
Which one?

12:56.485 --> 12:58.253
What?
I'm-I'm sorry, "which one"?

12:58.287 --> 13:00.255
Yeah, I've been sleeping
with two different girls.

13:00.289 --> 13:02.524
Who are you? It's like
I don't even know you!

13:02.558 --> 13:03.858
Sam, calm down!

13:03.893 --> 13:05.060
Artie, listen to us.

13:05.094 --> 13:07.762
You have to tell these girls
that you have chlamydia.

13:07.797 --> 13:09.731
If you don't, you're gonna
put their health at risk.

13:09.765 --> 13:11.566
And they could be
spreading it to others.

13:11.601 --> 13:14.081
It's the right thing to do.
You owe it to them.

13:16.213 --> 13:18.693
You have what?!
I can't believe this.

13:18.718 --> 13:20.152
I think I'm going to pass out.

13:20.187 --> 13:22.121
I'm so sorry. Let me explain.

13:22.155 --> 13:23.622
What is there to explain?!

13:23.657 --> 13:24.857
You have chlamydia.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.258
And now I have to get tested,

13:26.293 --> 13:28.360
which means I have to go down
to the campus free clinic,

13:28.395 --> 13:30.763
and sit in that waiting room
with warts on my face.

13:30.797 --> 13:33.165
Oh, my God! Am I going
to get a freaking canker?

13:33.200 --> 13:34.667
My parents are coming to visit.

13:34.701 --> 13:37.503
I just hope we can
still be friends.

13:37.537 --> 13:40.172
Friends?! No, Artie.
We are not friends.

13:40.207 --> 13:42.374
You are Patient Zero,
and I'm telling everyone

13:42.409 --> 13:44.977
to stay away from you because
you, Artie, are disgusting!

13:45.011 --> 13:46.212
Oh!

13:46.246 --> 13:48.380
And, Artie? Your films suck!

13:55.722 --> 13:57.556
Jessica?

13:57.591 --> 13:58.824
Can I talk to you in private?

13:58.859 --> 14:00.126
Sure.

14:01.394 --> 14:03.496
I'm-I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

14:04.567 --> 14:06.408
I tested positive
for chlamydia.

14:06.433 --> 14:07.967
Oh, okay, is that it?

14:08.001 --> 14:10.302
I don't know if you heard
what I said. I...

14:10.337 --> 14:12.204
You have chlamydia. I heard you.
Don't worry about it.

14:12.239 --> 14:13.672
I'll just go to the free clinic
today after class.

14:13.707 --> 14:15.541
You're not mad?
I'm not if you're not. I mean,

14:15.575 --> 14:17.816
for all we know, I could've
given it to you. Later.

14:18.111 --> 14:20.579
Artie.

14:20.614 --> 14:21.814
Can I talk to you for a second?

14:21.848 --> 14:23.482
Remember

14:23.517 --> 14:25.484
when you asked me out,
and I said no?

14:25.519 --> 14:26.585
Well,

14:26.620 --> 14:28.087
I thought about it
and I'm an idiot.

14:28.121 --> 14:29.488
I'd love to go out with you.

14:29.523 --> 14:31.524
Great.
Great.

14:31.558 --> 14:33.159
I'm free tomorrow night
if you maybe want

14:33.160 --> 14:34.226
to grab some food or something?

14:34.261 --> 14:35.161
Mm-hmm, sure.

14:35.195 --> 14:38.397
Awesome!
Well, I will see you then.

14:40.398 --> 14:42.878
But you like it, don't you?
It's subdued, right?

14:42.903 --> 14:45.037
It's, like, I wanted to
go all Russell Westbrook,

14:45.071 --> 14:46.705
but then I was like no,
more like 'Melo Anthony,

14:46.740 --> 14:47.740
'cause that's, like, my thing.

14:47.774 --> 14:49.375
Stop stressing.

14:49.409 --> 14:51.143
Look, I get it... you don't think
I'm gonna fit in here.

14:51.178 --> 14:53.145
Uh, blond hair, light skin.

14:53.180 --> 14:54.780
I'm-I'm DQ'd from the start.

14:54.815 --> 14:57.716
Let's just offer our thanks
for our blessings.

14:57.751 --> 14:59.952
Speaking of, I have an offering.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.556
A clean, spotless
bill of health.

15:03.590 --> 15:04.790
What?

15:04.825 --> 15:06.025
In order to give you everything,

15:06.059 --> 15:07.860
I have to make sure I don't...

15:07.894 --> 15:09.228
give you anything.

15:09.262 --> 15:10.930
Okay. Come here.

15:11.965 --> 15:14.633
Baby, thank you so much.

15:14.668 --> 15:16.736
Total, total sweetness.

15:16.770 --> 15:19.271
But you are focusing way too
much on what's on the outside.

15:19.306 --> 15:20.773
I mean, the hair, the suit.

15:20.807 --> 15:22.875
And the other thing.
Hmm.

15:22.909 --> 15:25.077
I guess what
I'm trying to say is

15:25.112 --> 15:26.979
I'm still unsure
about going all the way.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.415
And I know that I love you,
but I don't know,

15:29.449 --> 15:32.084
I just, I want to turn
to God for the answers.

15:32.119 --> 15:34.687
I get it. In order to bring
someone into your life

15:34.721 --> 15:36.801
you have to bring
the Holy Spirit in first.

15:44.431 --> 15:47.466
And praise
to our brothers and sisters

15:47.501 --> 15:49.602
from the Land of the Rising Sun,

15:49.636 --> 15:51.937
who came all the way across

15:51.972 --> 15:55.474
from God's green Earth
to hear us lift our voices.

15:55.509 --> 15:57.610
Not that I'm having a bad time,

15:57.644 --> 16:00.646
uh, or anything,
but when does this end?

16:00.680 --> 16:01.881
Maybe your butt's too bony.

16:01.915 --> 16:04.483
Maybe you just need
to grow a church cushion.

16:04.518 --> 16:05.951
That's, that's not even...

16:07.187 --> 16:08.754
We haven't even got
to the good part.

16:08.789 --> 16:10.356
And I ask you,

16:10.390 --> 16:13.826
brothers and sisters in Christ,

16:13.860 --> 16:17.296
to let one of our own
speak from her heart.

16:17.330 --> 16:21.300
And lift your voices
to the steeple of this temple!

16:21.334 --> 16:23.636
To the melted snowcaps

16:23.670 --> 16:25.638
of Mount Sinai!

16:25.672 --> 16:27.073
Whoa.
To the battered,

16:27.107 --> 16:29.875
zero-gravity cubby holes

16:29.910 --> 16:32.878
of the International
Space Station!

16:32.913 --> 16:34.980
I give to you

16:35.015 --> 16:37.283
a gift from God

16:37.317 --> 16:40.820
the voice
of Miss Mercedes Jones!

I need everyone to pair up.

Half of you are Athenians,

19:09.758 --> 19:11.025
the other half Spartans.

19:11.059 --> 19:13.627
Athens shirts, Spartan skins.

19:13.662 --> 19:16.063
Guess I'll be the Spartan.

19:16.097 --> 19:17.665
Yeah, you will.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.300
<i>In high school I
did everything I could</i>

19:19.334 --> 19:21.402
<i>not to take my shirt off</i>
<i>in front of other people.</i>

19:21.436 --> 19:24.038
<i>Like, I don't think I showered</i>
<i>once after gym class.</i>

19:24.072 --> 19:26.140
<i>Now, though, thanks to</i>
<i>a little more working out,</i>

19:26.174 --> 19:28.309
<i>a little more protein,</i>
<i>my outside self</i>

19:28.343 --> 19:30.044
<i>is catching up</i>
<i>to my inside self.</i>

19:30.078 --> 19:31.579
Okay, begin!

19:34.032 --> 19:36.793
<i>And I feel pretty
comfortable in my skin.</i>

19:36.818 --> 19:39.153
<i>And that feels good.</i>

19:41.366 --> 19:43.366
<i>I have to be mindful</i>
<i>of Blaine though.</i>

19:43.391 --> 19:44.992
<i>New school, new city.</i>

19:45.026 --> 19:46.393
<i>It's stressful.</i>

19:46.428 --> 19:47.728
<i>He's being tested.</i>

19:47.762 --> 19:50.431
<i>We, as a couple,</i>
<i>are being tested.</i>

19:50.465 --> 19:53.801
<i>I can't let</i>
<i>my new confidence erode his.</i>

19:53.835 --> 19:55.803
So, I was thinking, you know,
as great as it is

19:55.837 --> 19:57.171
to have the whole gang
back together again,

19:57.205 --> 19:58.639
why don't you and I
have a date night?

19:58.673 --> 19:59.974
You know, just the two of us.

20:00.008 --> 20:01.008
Maybe dinner and a movie?

20:01.042 --> 20:02.282
I would love that.

20:02.310 --> 20:03.677
I'm working on dinner,
so you pick the movie.

20:03.712 --> 20:05.713
All I ask is that it's
in color, in English,

20:05.747 --> 20:07.214
and made after 1989.

20:08.881 --> 20:10.761
What are you whipping up
in there?

20:10.786 --> 20:12.186
Fettuccine in a cream sauce,

20:12.220 --> 20:15.589
potato gratin and a molten
chocolate cake for dessert.

20:15.624 --> 20:17.591
We can't eat all that.

20:17.626 --> 20:18.793
I mean, it's just
a little heavy.

20:18.827 --> 20:20.394
I hope you're not trying
to plump me up.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.730
Since when are you manorexic?

20:22.764 --> 20:25.366
I'm not, I'm just taking
better care of myself.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.169
You know, as actors our bodies
are our instruments.

20:28.203 --> 20:30.771
And my instrument is, um,
getting a little out of tune?

20:30.806 --> 20:33.073
Is that where you're going
with this?

20:33.108 --> 20:35.910
No, your instrument is
as handsome as ever.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.578
I was just thinking maybe we

20:37.612 --> 20:39.380
skip the fettuccine
and walk to the movies

20:39.414 --> 20:41.382
and pick up a salad
at Pax on the way.

20:42.584 --> 20:44.418
Sure.

20:44.453 --> 20:45.886
I guess this'll keep.

20:45.921 --> 20:48.556
Great. I'll look up show times.

20:48.590 --> 20:51.625
I hear there's a great new indie
playing at the Quad.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.995
Um, Blaine?

20:55.030 --> 20:57.264
Don't worry, I won't order
popcorn at the movie theater.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.666
And by the way, I-I know

20:58.700 --> 21:00.935
that I've been putting
on a few pounds.

21:00.969 --> 21:03.504
No, no.
It's just this, um, very...

21:03.538 --> 21:04.572
adult Web site

21:04.606 --> 21:06.407
I-I just found on your computer.

21:06.441 --> 21:08.876
I-I wasn't snooping.
Uh, it was just, it was open,

21:08.910 --> 21:11.245
um, uh, uh, right there on the
window on the desktop. Uh...

21:11.279 --> 21:12.613
well, I-I, it was just,

21:12.647 --> 21:14.915
um, oh, uh...

21:14.950 --> 21:16.951
"FratBoyPhysicals.com."

21:16.985 --> 21:18.586
How often are you on this?

21:18.620 --> 21:20.688
You know?
I-I don't want to know.

21:20.722 --> 21:23.157
Whatever you do on your computer
is-is-is your business.

21:23.191 --> 21:24.792
But I-I-I just

21:24.826 --> 21:26.494
I find it a little interesting
that we haven't been intimate

21:26.528 --> 21:29.130
in-in, like a week,
and maybe this is why.

21:29.164 --> 21:31.732
Wait, wait, Kurt,
l-l-let's talk about this.

21:31.767 --> 21:34.702
No, I don't want
to talk about this!

21:38.073 --> 21:39.206
She's so pretty.

21:39.241 --> 21:40.908
I have to find out
who does her hair.

21:40.942 --> 21:44.278
"Celebrity Beauty
Tips and Tricks."

21:44.312 --> 21:46.814
Rachel?

21:48.150 --> 21:49.984
Can I ask you something, um...?

21:50.018 --> 21:52.019
It's a little personal.

21:52.053 --> 21:53.521
Yeah, of course. What's up?

21:53.555 --> 21:55.656
What was your first time like?

21:55.690 --> 21:59.493
Oh, are you...
and Sam are thinking of...?

21:59.528 --> 22:02.063
I mean, was... was it
like a... a big deal?

22:02.097 --> 22:04.165
Was there, like,
a hotel and flowers?

22:04.199 --> 22:06.300
'Cause I just... I feel like
I'm a little too old for that.

22:06.334 --> 22:07.535
You know, it's not gonna be

22:07.569 --> 22:09.703
romantic as if I were back
in high school,

22:09.738 --> 22:12.073
and I don't need, like,
a big moment or anything,

22:12.107 --> 22:13.174
but...

22:13.208 --> 22:14.508
as silly as it sounds,

22:14.543 --> 22:17.144
I do want it to be... special.

22:17.179 --> 22:19.480
No, I know I want at least that.

22:19.514 --> 22:21.348
Well, my first time,

22:21.383 --> 22:23.417
uh, it was just at his house.

22:23.452 --> 22:24.552
Mm.
And, um,

22:24.586 --> 22:26.187
it was special because,

22:26.221 --> 22:27.588
you know, it was with him,

22:27.622 --> 22:29.557
and I loved him,
and he loved me.

22:29.591 --> 22:31.559
I just...

22:31.593 --> 22:34.962
I don't know
if I'm ready for this.

22:34.996 --> 22:37.298
Look, I don't think
anyone can ever know,

22:37.332 --> 22:39.500
like, how or if
they're ever gonna be ready.

22:39.534 --> 22:41.569
I just think that in the moment,
when you're with that person,

22:41.603 --> 22:42.837
you just feel like
you want to remember

22:42.871 --> 22:44.105
being with them for forever,

22:44.139 --> 22:45.980
and then, everything will just
fall into place.

22:46.007 --> 22:48.509
Kind of wish
it was both of our first times,

22:48.543 --> 22:52.380
'cause I just don't know
if I'm gonna be any good at it.

22:52.414 --> 22:53.681
No, don't think like that.

22:53.715 --> 22:55.483
Sam is a really good guy.

22:55.517 --> 22:57.485
Okay, and if you feel
like it's right,

22:57.519 --> 23:00.254
then, he will make you feel
like you're the only one.

23:00.288 --> 23:03.124
Okay.

23:05.494 --> 23:07.895
Hey. We were supposed to meet
at the diner so we could walk

23:07.929 --> 23:09.597
to class together. What happened?
Oh.

23:09.631 --> 23:11.632
Sorry. I got off early,
and I forgot to text you.

23:11.666 --> 23:14.535
Gather up!
Okay, today is

23:14.569 --> 23:18.706
stage weaponry, and, yes,
this is a real bo staff.

23:18.740 --> 23:21.409
And, no, you will not be
using real blades yet.

23:21.443 --> 23:22.943
Not until you can be trusted.

23:22.978 --> 23:26.514
Remember... safety
first, safety last.

23:26.548 --> 23:27.948
Safety always.

23:27.983 --> 23:29.550
That's right.

23:29.584 --> 23:32.119
You're still mad about
the Web site thing, aren't you?

23:32.154 --> 23:33.688
No. God.

23:33.722 --> 23:35.222
All right, everyone partner up

23:35.257 --> 23:38.492
and start moving your way
through the weapon stations.

23:38.527 --> 23:41.328
I really think we
should talk about this.

23:41.363 --> 23:42.630
You know what, Blaine?

23:42.664 --> 23:45.066

26:15.617 --> 26:17.084
You sure?
Safety first.

26:17.119 --> 26:18.886
I said I'm fine.

26:30.303 --> 26:32.104
Oh, my God, I love this place.

26:32.105 --> 26:34.306
Well, can I get you two
lovebirds anything else?

26:34.340 --> 26:37.242
Uh, yeah. What's the most
expensive dessert on the menu?

26:37.276 --> 26:38.643
Sam!

26:38.678 --> 26:40.178
Uh, it's a diner, Sam.
I don't think

26:40.213 --> 26:41.279
there's really anything
too expensive.

26:41.314 --> 26:42.681
What about, uh, do you
guys have those milkshakes

26:42.715 --> 26:44.116
with, like, little specks
of gold in 'em?

26:44.150 --> 26:45.283
We do not.

26:45.318 --> 26:46.952
Sam, you do not have any money.

26:46.986 --> 26:48.553
I'm not gonna let you
pay for this meal.

26:50.623 --> 26:53.325
Oh! Oh, look! There's Artie!
I'm gonna go say hi.

26:53.359 --> 26:54.593
Don't touch him.

26:54.627 --> 26:56.027
What? Why would I touch him?

26:56.062 --> 26:57.295
Just don't touch him.

26:57.330 --> 26:59.097
Hello...! Welcome
to the Spotlight Diner!

26:59.132 --> 27:01.199
Julie, this is my friend,
Kurt. We went

27:01.234 --> 27:02.400
to high school together.

27:02.435 --> 27:03.668
Nice to meet you.

27:03.703 --> 27:06.371
This place is so cool!
Totally worth

27:06.405 --> 27:08.407
the 45 minute subway ride.

27:08.441 --> 27:10.842
So, do you guys want a HPV
or herpes simplex two?

27:10.877 --> 27:11.910
What?

27:11.944 --> 27:14.012
He asked if we want
a table or a booth.

27:14.046 --> 27:15.347
Oh. HPV.

27:15.381 --> 27:16.815
I mean, a table.

27:16.849 --> 27:18.583
Follow me.

27:21.084 --> 27:23.564
Look, Sam, I know
what you're doing.

27:23.589 --> 27:25.724
We're on a date,
we had a really great night,

27:25.758 --> 27:27.959
you tried to pay
for this delicious meal.

27:27.994 --> 27:29.428
And what's wrong with that?

27:29.462 --> 27:32.197
Nothing, as long
as you're not assuming

27:32.231 --> 27:34.866
that this night is going
to end up a certain way.

27:34.901 --> 27:36.401
Okay, I'm not assuming anything.

27:36.436 --> 27:38.637
I'm just, I'm just trying
to treat my lady right.

27:38.638 --> 27:40.839
You know, I don't do things
in exchange for anything.

27:40.873 --> 27:42.841
I just, that's just my way
of saying I love you.

27:42.875 --> 27:44.843
Oh.

27:44.877 --> 27:46.945
All right, what can
I get you two?

27:46.979 --> 27:48.213
How about you, rolling STD?

27:48.247 --> 27:50.248
Um, how's your Reuben?
It's okay,

27:50.283 --> 27:52.384
but there is a lot of pus on it.

27:52.418 --> 27:54.553
I'll have that.

27:54.587 --> 27:57.389
Would you recommend the
wartburger with grilled scabies

27:57.423 --> 27:59.424
or the fettuccine
in chlamydia sauce?

27:59.459 --> 28:01.293
People love our wartburger,

28:01.327 --> 28:03.462
but, um, I would go with
the chlamydia fettuccine.

28:03.496 --> 28:05.764
It's my personal favorite thing
from the menu.

28:05.798 --> 28:07.265
Oh, look!
It's someone's birthday!

28:07.300 --> 28:10.202
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap,
clap, clap, clap...

28:10.236 --> 28:12.237
I'm sorry, Kurt,
can you give us a second?

28:12.271 --> 28:13.772
Yeah.

28:15.441 --> 28:17.809
Julie, I need
to tell you something.

28:17.844 --> 28:19.211
I really, really like you.

28:19.245 --> 28:22.581
And I don't want to ruin what
we have by moving too fast.

28:22.615 --> 28:24.456
I think it would be better
for our relationship

28:24.484 --> 28:28.286
if we agree not have sex
for the next seven to ten days.

28:28.321 --> 28:30.322
Okay...

28:30.356 --> 28:33.458
um, that's sort of an insanely
weird thing to bring up.

28:33.493 --> 28:35.627
I just really like you,
and I don't want to...

28:35.661 --> 28:38.096
Yeah, I-I get it, but this
is a first date, right?

28:38.131 --> 28:40.499
So this thing that "we have"

28:40.533 --> 28:42.467
started a little less
than an hour ago.

28:42.502 --> 28:44.403
Which means I myself
wasn't even really thinking

28:44.437 --> 28:47.506
about sex, to be honest.

28:47.540 --> 28:50.308
So, yeah, I think I'll be able
to wait an entire week.

28:50.343 --> 28:54.279
Week to ten days.
Right. Not a problem.

28:56.349 --> 28:59.151
Look, do you know how much
it means to me that

28:59.185 --> 29:00.185
you're even considering this?

29:00.219 --> 29:01.386
Look, I mean, I don't know

29:01.421 --> 29:02.621
if our relationship is forever,

29:02.655 --> 29:04.456
but I know that nothing's
ever felt

29:04.490 --> 29:06.658
as real to me
as my love for you.

29:06.692 --> 29:08.760
And if there's a way
for me to express

29:08.795 --> 29:10.362
how I feel about you,

29:10.396 --> 29:14.933
whether it's buying you dinner
or spending time with you

29:14.967 --> 29:16.968
or having sex,
I-I want to do it.

31:58.455 --> 31:59.822
And and top of the clothes.

32:00.857 --> 32:02.625
Have you ever heard of the term

32:02.659 --> 32:04.627
"high, dry, and suffering"?

32:04.661 --> 32:06.262
Have you ever heard
of the term,

32:06.296 --> 32:07.530
"Hell to the no"?

32:07.564 --> 32:09.465
Sit up. Come on.
Let's talk.

32:13.470 --> 32:14.837
What's up?

32:14.871 --> 32:19.074
Well, you know, everything
that you said to me, um,

32:19.109 --> 32:21.010
in the diner,
it really meant a lot.

32:21.044 --> 32:24.680
And I do believe that if
we were to take that step,

32:24.714 --> 32:26.782
that it will be incredible
and special.

32:26.817 --> 32:28.851
Well, you know, I've never been
like this with anybody before.

32:28.885 --> 32:30.853
So, in a lot of ways,

32:30.887 --> 32:32.755
it would be a first time
for me, too.

32:32.789 --> 32:34.824
I went back to church
and I prayed about

32:34.858 --> 32:36.091
all of this all over again.

32:36.126 --> 32:37.993
And I need to wait, Sam.

32:38.028 --> 32:41.130
Okay, um, I can, I can dig that.

32:41.889 --> 32:43.809
How long? Like, um,
a couple weeks?

32:43.834 --> 32:45.935
Until I'm married.

32:45.969 --> 32:47.837
All right, hold on.

32:47.871 --> 32:49.638
Okay, I-I love you,
but I don't think

32:49.673 --> 32:51.607
I can get married
in a couple of weeks.

32:51.641 --> 32:53.709
We haven't even
sent out invitations,

32:53.743 --> 32:55.444
and that takes a long time.

32:55.479 --> 32:57.680
I know that this

32:57.714 --> 32:59.181
sounds old-fashioned,

32:59.216 --> 33:01.517
but there's this special part
in my soul,

33:01.551 --> 33:03.886
and it's the most secret
and vulnerable part,

33:03.920 --> 33:06.555
and when I give that to a man,

33:06.590 --> 33:08.824
I'll be completely exposed.

33:08.859 --> 33:11.160
I can't just do that
with just anyone.

33:12.195 --> 33:14.130
I'm not just anyone.

33:16.900 --> 33:20.035
I need to know that
the man that I'm with

33:20.070 --> 33:21.570
is gonna be there
for me forever.

33:21.605 --> 33:23.239
I want him to be my husband

33:23.273 --> 33:24.573
and I want him to open up to me

33:24.608 --> 33:26.542
in the same way, too.

33:26.576 --> 33:28.744
You know, maybe when I do it

33:28.778 --> 33:31.046
I'll feel silly for making it
such a big deal,

33:31.081 --> 33:32.214
but maybe I won't.

33:32.249 --> 33:34.016
So you're saying it's just,

33:34.050 --> 33:36.819
it's never gonna happen
unless we get married.

33:36.853 --> 33:37.887
Well, yeah.

33:37.921 --> 33:39.889
I mean, for now we'll just...

33:39.923 --> 33:41.891
have to figure out
ways to feel close

33:41.925 --> 33:43.092
that aren't physical.

33:43.126 --> 33:44.160
Okay, so...

33:44.194 --> 33:45.694
what's the difference in that

33:45.729 --> 33:47.396
and just being
really good friends?

33:47.430 --> 33:48.464
Okay? I...

33:48.498 --> 33:49.765
I love you, Mercedes,

33:49.800 --> 33:52.101
but, like, I'm also
a 19-year-old guy, and...

33:52.135 --> 33:54.470
I want to be able
to do this for you.

33:54.504 --> 33:55.838
But I-I can't.

34:01.411 --> 34:03.371
Can I have some time
to think about it?

34:04.314 --> 34:05.948
Yeah, sure.

34:05.982 --> 34:08.417
Take your time.

34:13.889 --> 34:15.458
Yeah.

34:15.492 --> 34:17.860
Yeah, he's here.

34:17.893 --> 34:19.661
Okay. Okay, bye.

34:19.696 --> 34:21.697
Bye.

34:23.833 --> 34:25.534
That was Rachel.

34:25.569 --> 34:28.370
She was just confirming us
for her opening night.

34:28.405 --> 34:29.938
What'd you tell her?

34:29.973 --> 34:31.907
I said, "Yeah, if we don't

34:31.942 --> 34:33.242
"kill each other
in Combat Class,

34:33.275 --> 34:35.277
count us in."

34:35.312 --> 34:37.346
What happened in there?

34:37.380 --> 34:38.813
You were really coming at me,

34:38.849 --> 34:40.382
like-like... as if
you had something to prove.

34:40.417 --> 34:42.384
What, I'm not sure.

34:42.418 --> 34:44.219
That I'm as strong as you are.

34:44.920 --> 34:46.655
Okay, but it's not a contest.

34:46.690 --> 34:47.656
Isn't it, though?

34:47.690 --> 34:50.626
On some level?

34:50.659 --> 34:52.460
'Cause for the first time
in my life,

34:52.496 --> 34:54.330
I really feel like I'm losing.

34:54.364 --> 34:55.664
I've felt that way

34:55.699 --> 34:56.859
ever since I got to New York.

34:56.867 --> 34:59.068
I feel like...

34:59.102 --> 35:00.836
we're in this race together

35:00.871 --> 35:05.207
and you are just so much
farther than I am.

35:05.242 --> 35:07.243
Like, it just feels
like the whole balance

35:07.277 --> 35:08.244
has shifted.

35:08.278 --> 35:09.278
What balance?

35:10.881 --> 35:12.648
I guess it started when

35:12.682 --> 35:14.316
we first met,
and you came to Dalton

35:14.351 --> 35:15.317
because you were trying

35:15.352 --> 35:16.652
to get away from Karofsky

35:16.686 --> 35:18.120
and I wanted to help
you through that.

35:18.155 --> 35:19.355
And you did.

35:19.389 --> 35:21.257
And I loved the way that felt.

35:21.291 --> 35:23.125
I loved, I loved being
able to protect you,

35:23.160 --> 35:24.627
but now I look at your life

35:24.661 --> 35:26.662
and... it's
completely different.

35:26.696 --> 35:28.197
Y-You're a star at school,

35:28.231 --> 35:29.665
y-you have all these
cool new friends,

35:29.700 --> 35:32.134
you started this band
and I just...

35:32.169 --> 35:33.469
I feel like you don't
need me anymore.

35:33.503 --> 35:35.304
To protect or anything.

35:35.338 --> 35:37.273
I mean, you asked me
to move out, for God's sake.

35:37.307 --> 35:38.874
We made that decision together.

35:38.909 --> 35:41.243
So-so is that what

35:41.278 --> 35:43.479
all this stuff is about,
that's going on?

35:43.513 --> 35:44.980
I mean, you trying
to get me to eat more?

35:45.015 --> 35:46.649
I don't like the way

35:46.683 --> 35:49.151
that I feel about myself
anymore, Kurt. Okay?

35:49.186 --> 35:50.986
And you have this, like...

35:51.021 --> 35:52.388
amazing new body.

35:52.422 --> 35:54.623
Do you want to know why
we haven't been intimate?

35:54.658 --> 35:57.226
It's because I feel
insecure around you.

35:57.260 --> 36:00.329
I feel insecure
around my own fiancé,

36:00.364 --> 36:03.999
and fratboyphysicals.com
isn't gonna judge me.

36:04.034 --> 36:05.034
And neither will I.

36:05.068 --> 36:06.469
Ever.

36:06.503 --> 36:08.571
But I am not going to apologize

36:08.605 --> 36:10.005
for not being some
delicate flower

36:10.040 --> 36:11.474
that needs his boyfriend
to protect him.

36:11.508 --> 36:12.508
And you know what?
Maybe you're right.

36:12.542 --> 36:13.876
Maybe it is a contest.

36:13.910 --> 36:16.479
Maybe that's the way
it has to be with two guys.

36:16.513 --> 36:18.948
But I would much rather be
running this race with you

36:18.982 --> 36:20.116
rather than against you.

36:20.150 --> 36:21.817
Me, too. I just...

36:21.852 --> 36:23.786
As equals.

36:23.820 --> 36:24.820
I know, I know.

36:24.855 --> 36:25.821
I-I know.

36:25.856 --> 36:27.189
I know that, I'm sorry.

36:27.224 --> 36:29.225
I'm just...

36:31.161 --> 36:35.097
I'm just so scared
that you're gonna...

36:35.132 --> 36:36.899
keep changing,

36:36.933 --> 36:39.869
and you're gonna
keep getting stronger,

36:39.903 --> 36:41.570
and then one day
you're gonna wake up

36:41.605 --> 36:44.940
and you're gonna realize that
"I don't love him anymore."

36:44.975 --> 36:47.176
Never.

36:47.210 --> 36:48.911
I'm always gonna love you.

36:48.945 --> 36:51.047
And I don't want
you to be insecure

36:51.081 --> 36:52.381
or ashamed around me.

36:53.917 --> 36:55.418
Next time you're going through
something like this,

36:55.452 --> 36:57.332
you-you have to be
honest with me.

36:59.356 --> 37:00.389
Okay.

37:07.998 --> 37:10.433
Julie.
I need to talk to you.

37:10.467 --> 37:12.268
Our date was weird, and
I wanted to apologize.

37:12.302 --> 37:13.936
Yeah, it was weird.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.371
You were all jumpy and nervous

37:15.405 --> 37:17.940
and the sex conversation
was really bizarre.

37:17.975 --> 37:19.608
Well, there was a reason
why I was acting so weird,

37:19.643 --> 37:20.943
and it's difficult
to talk about,

37:20.978 --> 37:22.858
but I need to be
completely honest.

37:23.413 --> 37:24.780
I have chlamydia.

37:24.815 --> 37:26.415
Are you serious?

37:26.450 --> 37:27.616
Yeah.

37:27.651 --> 37:28.951
And I'm not even sure
who I got it from.

37:28.986 --> 37:30.586
What? You don't know?

37:30.620 --> 37:31.954
Well, it was either Vanessa

37:31.989 --> 37:33.622
from our Postwar
European Cinema class,

37:33.657 --> 37:35.291
or Jessica from my

37:35.325 --> 37:36.425
Contemporary Voices in
Venereal Horror Seminar.

37:36.460 --> 37:39.328
Wait, you slept with <i> them?</i>

37:39.363 --> 37:41.964
Artie, that's grosser
than the chlamydia.

37:41.999 --> 37:43.132
Those girls are idiots.

37:43.166 --> 37:44.100
Last term,

37:44.134 --> 37:45.255
Vanessa made a short film

37:45.268 --> 37:46.669
that consisted of
a single shot of her

37:46.703 --> 37:48.671
eating a pile of dirt
for 45 minutes.

37:48.705 --> 37:51.007
And Jessica had an endoscopy
for a stomach ulcer

37:51.041 --> 37:53.409
and then entitled the footage
"Another Holocaust"

37:53.443 --> 37:54.910
and submitted it to Sundance.

37:54.945 --> 37:56.412
Look, I just wanted to be
completely honest with you...

37:56.446 --> 37:58.080
Well, great.

37:58.115 --> 38:00.149
Great, that you want to honest,

38:00.183 --> 38:03.486
'cause honesty makes you see
who everyone really is,

38:03.520 --> 38:04.820
and who you are

38:04.855 --> 38:06.122
is not who I thought you were.

38:07.090 --> 38:08.491
You're a creeper, Artie.

38:08.525 --> 38:10.026
Congratulations

38:10.060 --> 38:12.061
on totally skeeving me out.

38:23.356 --> 38:24.657
Hey, Mercedes, it's Sam.

38:24.691 --> 38:26.225
Yeah, I-I know.

38:26.259 --> 38:28.194
Um, if you're calling
to break up with me,

38:28.228 --> 38:30.529
just go ahead and say it
a-and just get it over with,

38:30.564 --> 38:32.725
so we can figure out
how we're gonna be friends.

38:38.004 --> 38:39.338
Hold up.

38:39.372 --> 38:40.639
Blaine lit a bunch of candles.

38:40.674 --> 38:41.674
Blaine!

38:45.278 --> 38:46.312
Blaine!

38:47.414 --> 38:48.714
Mercedes,
I gotta cut this short.

38:48.748 --> 38:50.416
My girlfriend,
uh, just arrived.

38:50.450 --> 38:52.751
Oh, uh, don't worry.

38:52.786 --> 38:55.226
I have a fire extinguisher handy
in case anything tips over.

38:56.490 --> 38:58.591
Look, uh, I hope you don't
think I'm copying you,

38:58.625 --> 39:00.659
but I also prayed about us.

39:00.694 --> 39:02.394
I didn't go back
to that church,

39:02.429 --> 39:04.764
'cause I didn't remember
where it was, but...

39:04.798 --> 39:07.039
I prayed in the bathroom
and that's where it hit me.

39:07.667 --> 39:10.402
sex is awesome.

39:10.437 --> 39:11.604
It's like one of
the greatest things

39:11.638 --> 39:12.638
that God ever invented.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.375
But what's better
than sex? Um...

39:16.410 --> 39:17.376
Horseback riding.

39:17.410 --> 39:20.312
Um... skydiving,
probably.

39:20.347 --> 39:22.314
And hearing you sing.

39:23.350 --> 39:25.251
Look, I-I don't need

39:25.285 --> 39:26.652
to think about this any more.

39:26.686 --> 39:29.054
I... you know,
I've said this before,

39:29.089 --> 39:30.890
but this time,
I really mean it.

39:30.924 --> 39:33.225
I can... live without sex.

39:34.494 --> 39:36.128
But I can't live without you.

39:36.163 --> 39:37.284
Sam Evans...

39:42.068 --> 39:44.136
You have no idea how nice it is

39:44.171 --> 39:46.038
to have a real girlfriend
here to talk to.

39:46.073 --> 39:47.540
I mean, Kurt pretends
to be one,

39:47.574 --> 39:48.874
but it's not the same,

39:48.909 --> 39:50.843
and Santana was just
a <i> tad</i> unpredictable.

39:50.877 --> 39:53.079
Yeah, well, thanks
for the good advice

39:53.113 --> 39:55.281
about the whole S-E-X thing.

39:55.315 --> 39:56.849
Okay, my philosophy is that if

39:56.883 --> 39:58.724
you can't even say the
word without spelling it,

39:58.752 --> 40:00.453
then you're
definitely not ready.

40:00.487 --> 40:02.721
Hey, I am not a prude.

40:02.756 --> 40:04.023
Okay.

40:04.057 --> 40:05.591
Okay.
I'm kind of a prude.

40:06.960 --> 40:09.829
But you know, my heart is
my biggest erogenous zone.

40:09.863 --> 40:11.597
I just... if I decide to do it,

40:11.631 --> 40:13.265
I want it to be
the making love version,

40:13.300 --> 40:15.167
not the bumping uglies version.

40:15.202 --> 40:16.602
Well, Sam definitely loves you,

40:16.636 --> 40:18.437
because I don't know
any other 19-year-old boy

40:18.438 --> 40:19.739
who would say it's okay to wait

40:19.773 --> 40:21.493
if he wasn't, like,
totally in love with you

40:21.508 --> 40:22.641
and obsessed with you.

40:22.676 --> 40:24.610
No, I know that he loves me now.

40:24.644 --> 40:28.180
But it's easy to love
when it's new, you know, and...

40:28.215 --> 40:29.782
if he can put up with
my crazy and my sass

40:29.816 --> 40:30.916
for just a couple more weeks...

40:30.951 --> 40:32.418
or even a couple of months...
who knows?

40:32.452 --> 40:34.086
Well, I salute you.

40:34.121 --> 40:36.021
And I have a very
good feeling about this

40:36.056 --> 40:37.723
and I think Sam's a great guy.
Yeah.

40:37.758 --> 40:39.191
I don't know, there was
like a minute there

40:39.226 --> 40:40.793
where I thought something might
happen between he and I,

40:40.827 --> 40:41.994
but it passed, thankfully.

40:42.029 --> 40:43.829
Really? How come?

40:43.864 --> 40:45.364
Well, besides the fact

40:45.399 --> 40:46.879
that you two are
obviously soul mates.

40:46.900 --> 40:48.434
Oh, my God, obviously.

40:48.468 --> 40:50.102
No, I don't think
I actually liked him,

40:50.137 --> 40:51.337
I think I just, like...

40:51.371 --> 40:52.771
I don't know,
he reminded me of home

40:52.773 --> 40:54.240
and he and Finn were very close

40:54.274 --> 40:55.875
and I think I liked the fact

40:55.909 --> 40:57.276
that he understood how I felt.

40:57.310 --> 40:59.845
So...

40:59.880 --> 41:01.380
there's, like, not any guys

41:01.415 --> 41:02.548
that you're interested in?

41:02.582 --> 41:05.184
Like, um... none of
your cast members,

41:05.218 --> 41:06.519
or that director?

41:06.553 --> 41:07.520
Please.

41:07.554 --> 41:08.788
This is closed for business.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.400
Rachel, you know
you guys weren't dating

41:11.425 --> 41:12.725
when it all went down, though.

41:12.759 --> 41:14.794
No, come on,
we were always dating.

41:14.828 --> 41:16.128
You know, even when we weren't.

41:16.163 --> 41:18.030
We knew how it was gonna end.

41:18.065 --> 41:19.699
Or, you know,
how it was supposed to.

41:19.733 --> 41:21.033
I get that.

41:21.068 --> 41:22.768
I think we all did.

41:22.803 --> 41:25.237
But you're this amazing,
beautiful woman

41:25.272 --> 41:27.907
about to go through the
greatest triumph in her life.

41:27.941 --> 41:29.575
Hey, I'm not saying
that you need

41:29.609 --> 41:31.911
to go out there and
fall in love, but...

41:31.945 --> 41:33.779
let a dude, I don't know,
buy you dinner.

41:33.814 --> 41:35.114
Tell you how hot you are.

41:35.148 --> 41:36.449
I know. I should.

41:36.483 --> 41:37.917
And I will.

41:37.951 --> 41:39.151
It's just like...

41:39.186 --> 41:40.519
you know, it's like a line

41:40.554 --> 41:42.488
between your past
and your future and...

41:42.522 --> 41:44.156
I mean, I'll draw it
when I'm ready.

41:44.191 --> 41:45.825
It's like you and Sam.
You know, you weren't ready;

41:45.859 --> 41:47.259
you just had to listen
to your heart

41:47.294 --> 41:48.661
and you'll know when it's right.
I know, babe.

41:48.695 --> 41:50.329
You're okay, though, right?

41:50.364 --> 41:52.598
Like, I didn't push too hard,
did I?

41:52.632 --> 41:55.001
No.

41:55.035 --> 41:56.235
Like I said, it's really great

41:56.236 --> 41:57.636
having a girlfriend
here to talk to.

41:58.538 --> 42:00.298
You know what?
It really is.

42:03.377 --> 42:04.977
So how does that work, exactly?

42:05.012 --> 42:07.013
Well, I have
to drink five pints

42:07.047 --> 42:08.287
of hot coconut water every day,

42:08.315 --> 42:09.515
with a little garlic salt,
some Splenda

42:09.549 --> 42:12.184
and a splash of hot sauce.

42:12.219 --> 42:15.021
Then you basically jog
until you hallucinate.

42:15.055 --> 42:16.956
I got it off of
Matthew McConaughey's blog.

42:16.990 --> 42:18.791
- That doesn't sound healthy.
- It's not.

42:18.825 --> 42:20.359
What we're really doing
is just saying that, you know,

42:20.394 --> 42:21.360
we're gonna start
eating healthier

42:21.395 --> 42:22.728
and cooking healthier

42:22.763 --> 42:25.044
and, uh, we started this new
ab class at the NYADA gym

42:25.065 --> 42:26.666
and, uh, this is
kind of our way

42:26.700 --> 42:28.267
of saying good-bye
to eating out for a while.

42:28.301 --> 42:29.869
So thank you so much
for being here

42:29.903 --> 42:31.783
on the start of
Blaine's cleanse.

42:33.173 --> 42:34.273
Whoa, Artie...

42:34.307 --> 42:36.175
You want to talk about it?
Talk about what?

42:36.209 --> 42:37.877
Oh, my God,
that looks really delicious.

42:37.911 --> 42:38.944
What you're burying
in your worry hole

42:38.979 --> 42:40.046
with all that hot fudge
and nuts?

42:40.080 --> 42:42.148
That girl Julie
still not talking to you?

42:42.182 --> 42:43.983
She's not <i> not</i> talking to me,

42:44.017 --> 42:46.686
it's just... I can see how she
sees me now, and it sucks.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.321
I didn't think there'd
actually be a downside

42:48.355 --> 42:50.222
to being a film school
player, but I was wrong.

42:50.257 --> 42:51.223
And I'd paid the price.

42:51.258 --> 42:53.559
Herpes.
No.

42:53.593 --> 42:54.694
Losing Julie.

42:54.728 --> 42:57.396
And it was chlamydia.
Anyway...

42:57.431 --> 42:59.031
I'm gonna give up the game.

42:59.066 --> 43:00.733
For a little while, at least.

43:00.767 --> 43:02.727
I mean, sex isn't
the be-all-end-all.

43:03.540 --> 43:05.580
Well, it's like me
and Mercedes, you know?

43:05.605 --> 43:07.373
Something's important, you can't
let sex get in the way of it.

43:07.407 --> 43:09.241
Hey, you know what, guys?

43:09.276 --> 43:11.911
We should do an all-guys
New York City Abstinence Club.

43:12.746 --> 43:14.113
No.

43:14.147 --> 43:15.114
No way.
Definitely not.

43:15.148 --> 43:16.115
That's not a good idea.

43:16.950 --> 43:18.484
Ugh...

43:18.518 --> 43:21.882
Mm... No Oscar
is worth that.
