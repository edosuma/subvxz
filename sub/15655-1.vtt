WEBVTT

00:35.200 --> 00:39.136
My great, great, great...

00:39.170 --> 00:42.537
great uncle was a signer
of the Declaration of Independence,

00:42.574 --> 00:46.066
and my mother's side started building
New York before the Revolution.

00:46.111 --> 00:48.944
You get the idea.

00:58.390 --> 01:01.791
I went to a party once and there was
a palm reader there.

01:03.495 --> 01:05.554
When she looked at my hand,
She just--

01:05.597 --> 01:08.464
She froze.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.491
And I said to her,
"I know.

01:10.535 --> 01:13.436
My life line is broken.

01:13.471 --> 01:17.168
I know I won't live
past 30."

01:24.315 --> 01:26.545
You know those photos
of smiling families

01:26.584 --> 01:28.745
you always see
on a mantelpiece?

01:31.389 --> 01:33.880
I can't even look at them,

01:33.925 --> 01:36.155
because you never know
what they're hiding.

01:39.497 --> 01:42.432
A "Life Magazine" photographer
came to our house

01:42.467 --> 01:46.062
to photograph
the "ideal American family."

01:46.104 --> 01:49.870
We looked happy
and pretty,

01:49.908 --> 01:53.537
but underneath

01:53.578 --> 01:56.445
it just wasn't
that way at all.

02:10.728 --> 02:12.821
Looks like the country
is disintegrating.

02:12.864 --> 02:14.855
Lost all its hope.

02:14.899 --> 02:18.665
There's always hope no matter
what's happened before.

02:18.703 --> 02:21.069
Yeah?

02:21.106 --> 02:22.869
Where's the hope in that?

02:22.913 --> 02:25.143
God, wouldn't it be wonderful
to know that students

02:25.182 --> 02:28.015
were looking at your work,
analyzing it?

02:28.051 --> 02:29.746
That depends on
what they're saying.

02:31.955 --> 02:34.753
I mean, people say
he's a no-talent freak.

02:34.792 --> 02:38.193
He's changing the way
that we look at the world, isn't he?

02:38.228 --> 02:40.788
I think people
who manage to do that

02:40.831 --> 02:43.561
must have the hardest
time in life.

02:46.036 --> 02:49.062
Are you sure you'll be okay
in New York?

02:49.106 --> 02:51.734
I'll be fine. I've got Chuck
to look after me.

02:53.577 --> 02:56.740
Oh, Syd, why won't
you come too?

02:56.780 --> 02:59.044
My folks would kill me.

02:59.082 --> 03:02.313
Where I come from,
it's not easy to get a scholarship.

03:04.888 --> 03:07.288
You know, I'm not so sure
about Chuck.

03:07.324 --> 03:10.020
He can be a real
shit sometimes.

03:10.060 --> 03:11.550
Don't worry.

03:15.632 --> 03:17.099
Edie!

03:21.638 --> 03:24.334
Chuckie, how can you want to go home?
We're in Manhattan.

03:24.374 --> 03:27.400
To become an artist,
I had to get out of that classroom.

03:27.444 --> 03:30.811
And to me New York was Jackson
Pollock sipping vodka

03:30.848 --> 03:33.874
and dripping paint
over a raw canvas.

03:33.917 --> 03:36.681
There's so much to see, Chuck.
Look where we are.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.847
Yeah, taking
New York by storm.

03:38.889 --> 03:40.584
Two zombies.

03:40.624 --> 03:43.184
Chuck and I had come down
together from Cambridge.

03:43.227 --> 03:45.354
You know, he was
a flamboyant socialite

03:45.395 --> 03:47.761
who carried a pocketful
of calling cards.

03:47.798 --> 03:50.824
He made me feel
I wasn't alone.

03:50.868 --> 03:52.995
- Can we play the game?
- I don't want to.

03:53.036 --> 03:54.867
- Come on.
- All right, go.

03:54.905 --> 03:56.736
- Lamb.
- Chop.

03:56.773 --> 03:58.104
- Pony.
- Snout.

03:58.141 --> 04:00.371
- Shy.
- You.

04:00.410 --> 04:03.641
- You think I'm shy?
- Sometimes.

04:03.680 --> 04:07.309
I guess I can
be shy sometimes.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.684
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

04:12.723 --> 04:16.159
What are your sins, my son?

04:16.193 --> 04:19.128
Well, I have this
friend Mark.

04:19.162 --> 04:22.359
Well, he buys all these clothes
from Bloomingdale's.

04:22.399 --> 04:24.492
But because he's from London,
everybody on the Cape

04:24.535 --> 04:26.628
keeps talking about
his "fabulous English look,"

04:26.670 --> 04:29.230
which really is so good.

04:29.273 --> 04:31.707
He was at a party
up there last weekend

04:31.742 --> 04:35.200
and Norman Mailer walked up
and punched him in the stomach.

04:35.245 --> 04:37.179
When Mark asked him why,

04:37.214 --> 04:39.546
he just said it was
"for wearing a pink coat."

04:39.583 --> 04:41.915
I know I should have
been happy for Mark

04:41.952 --> 04:43.613
that Norman Mailer
punched him,

04:43.654 --> 04:46.555
but all I could think was,
"Will Norman Mailer ever punch me?"

04:48.899 --> 04:52.665
Andy, why do you come
to confession?

04:52.702 --> 04:56.194
Well, because
it's a sin not to.

05:22.865 --> 05:25.060
Edie, come on now.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.795
It's going to be over
by the time you're done.

05:26.835 --> 05:28.530
You're not even
going to meet him.

05:32.774 --> 05:35.436
We're going to be late.
Very late.

05:47.924 --> 05:51.485
I just don't understand. Why are
Jasper's selling and mine are not?

05:53.134 --> 05:55.432
I wonder if Picasso
knows who I am yet.

05:55.453 --> 05:57.751
Andy, what are you doing
here all by yourself?

05:59.866 --> 06:02.096
How's the movie business?

06:02.135 --> 06:04.194
Oh, well, it's busy,
but I wouldn't call it a business.

06:04.237 --> 06:06.068
I haven't made
any money off of it yet.

06:06.105 --> 06:08.369
Of course you haven't, Andy.

06:08.408 --> 06:10.342
The movie business
is the most fickle in the world.

06:10.376 --> 06:12.173
- You know that.
- Oh.

06:12.211 --> 06:16.375
Listen, I have met
the most remarkable lady.

06:16.416 --> 06:18.850
- Oh.
- Old money-- very old.

06:18.885 --> 06:21.479
Oh good, does she want
to buy a painting? Who is she?

06:28.795 --> 06:30.854
Oh, thank you.
Oh!

06:30.897 --> 06:34.492
That's her.
That's Edie Sedgwick.

06:34.534 --> 06:36.331
Oh.

06:36.369 --> 06:38.929
What good manners. Chuckie,
pay attention to these gentlemen.

06:38.971 --> 06:40.939
You just might
learn something.

06:40.973 --> 06:44.500
Oh, wow.
She's so beautiful.

06:44.544 --> 06:47.104
It's like a morgue in here. Please.

06:47.146 --> 06:48.738
Her father struck
oil out west.

06:48.781 --> 06:52.774
She escaped to art school
in Cambridge or somewhere.

06:52.819 --> 06:55.310
Made her way
down here last year.

06:55.354 --> 06:57.481
She's done some modeling.

06:57.523 --> 06:59.184
Tried to get
into a gallery,

06:59.225 --> 07:01.750
but no one has ever seen
anything she's done.

07:01.794 --> 07:05.628
When you said "old money,"
you made her sound 50.

07:13.339 --> 07:16.172
- Is that the Andy Warhol?
- Mm-hmm.

07:16.209 --> 07:18.143
- Want to meet him?
- Of course.

07:18.177 --> 07:20.042
Edie, this is Andy.

07:20.079 --> 07:22.138
Hi.

07:22.181 --> 07:24.149
Oh, it's just amazing
to meet you.

07:24.183 --> 07:26.708
- I think you're just a genius.
- Oh.

07:26.753 --> 07:29.347
No one is doing anything
like you right now

07:29.388 --> 07:32.084
and that in itself is a sign
of brilliance, don't you think?

07:32.102 --> 07:33.797
But I'd love you to be
in one of my movies.

07:34.910 --> 07:37.879
And what would I have to do
in one of your movies?

07:37.913 --> 07:41.076
Just be yourself.

07:41.116 --> 07:43.550
Well which one?

07:43.559 --> 07:46.153
You're the boss,
applesauce.

07:47.375 --> 07:50.833
Andy, in your films,
what are you hoping to do?

07:50.878 --> 07:53.108
We're just trying
to make it so bad,

07:53.147 --> 07:55.012
but doing it well.

07:55.049 --> 07:58.450
You know, where you get the most
scratches you can on a film.

07:58.486 --> 08:00.215
Or all the dirt
you can get on a film.

08:03.257 --> 08:06.818
Or zooming badly,

08:06.861 --> 08:09.591
where you zoom and you
hit the most important--

08:09.631 --> 08:11.360
miss the most
important thing.

08:11.399 --> 08:14.095
And, uh...

08:15.570 --> 08:17.265
your camera jiggles

08:17.305 --> 08:20.536
so that everybody knows
you're watching a film.

08:20.575 --> 08:23.635
How do you work
with your actors then?

08:23.678 --> 08:25.509
What do you tell them?

08:29.384 --> 08:32.512
Well, I don't like
to tell them what to do.

08:32.553 --> 08:36.421
I mean, I just think
people are so interesting.

08:37.759 --> 08:40.250
Some say your work
is pornographic.

08:40.294 --> 08:43.752
Oh, yeah.

08:43.798 --> 08:46.164
Isn't that great?

09:00.181 --> 09:01.512
So...

09:01.549 --> 09:04.416
do you work in hay?

09:04.452 --> 09:07.319
Oh yeah,
we're making a cowboy movie.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.711
Who are all these people?

09:40.755 --> 09:43.189
Oh.

09:43.224 --> 09:44.885
- That's Rotten Rita.
- Now turn for me.

09:44.926 --> 09:47.895
And Silver George,
Debbie Dropout,

09:47.929 --> 09:49.954
the Turtle.

09:49.997 --> 09:51.692
I don't know who that is.

09:51.733 --> 09:54.668
Who's that?

09:54.702 --> 09:56.727
This is Ondine and Brigid.

09:56.771 --> 09:59.205
- This is Chuck and Edie.
- Hello.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.674
Andy, I got a new book
to draw in.

10:01.709 --> 10:04.303
It said on the front,
"The Topical Bible."

10:04.345 --> 10:06.336
I didn't know what the theme
should be, so I thought,

10:06.380 --> 10:09.907
"What rhymes with topical?"
And then I started rhyming.

10:09.951 --> 10:13.216
Topical, bopical...
and then I got to "C."

10:13.254 --> 10:17.088
Cockical. I mean, it's perfect, right?
An entire book about cocks.

10:17.125 --> 10:19.059
Yeah, that's great.

10:19.093 --> 10:20.617
Her last book
was called "Scars,"

10:20.661 --> 10:23.129
but "Cocks" has a nicer ring to it,
don't you think?

10:23.164 --> 10:24.828
Hmm.

10:24.873 --> 10:27.933
Ooh, maybe we can get
the President's.

10:27.976 --> 10:30.706
Oh yeah,
Johnson's johnson.

10:30.745 --> 10:32.645
Brigid, you got to
call your father.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.376
Are you insane, Andy? You know what
my father would say to me?

10:35.416 --> 10:37.475
- Maybe he'd want to be in the book.
- Yeah.

10:37.518 --> 10:40.385
Brigid's father has an empire.
He's very rich.

10:40.421 --> 10:43.288
Oh, you should do your cock
for the book too.

10:45.907 --> 10:47.704
Hey, Andy,
we're ready.

10:49.877 --> 10:52.209
Oh, we're gonna do the movie.
You want to see?

10:52.246 --> 10:55.545
I can give him a tranquilizer.

10:55.583 --> 10:58.177
Tranquilizer?
I'll take one of those, Mary.

10:58.219 --> 11:00.244
Will you put
the microphone in lower

11:00.288 --> 11:03.587
so we can see it?
Yeah, neat.

11:05.126 --> 11:07.287
- Have you used one before?
- No.

11:07.328 --> 11:09.558
It's easy.
Why don't you turn it on?

11:09.597 --> 11:12.862
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.767
Andy Warhol's "Horse."

11:20.842 --> 11:22.707
Which one of you
has a gun?

11:25.146 --> 11:27.376
Which one of you has a gun?

11:27.415 --> 11:29.781
Look at the size of it.

11:29.817 --> 11:32.911
Ooh, look at that gun.

11:32.954 --> 11:36.446
- I want to ride it on the prairie.
- I bet you do.

11:36.490 --> 11:38.856
- You've seen bigger, yeah?
- No, of course not.

11:38.893 --> 11:40.224
- Except once or twice.
- Hello?

11:40.261 --> 11:42.252
We're doing a movie.

11:42.996 --> 11:46.090
- Easy, horsie.
- Whoa.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.298
- Whoa, easy there, boy.
- Oh my.

11:48.335 --> 11:49.570
All right.

11:50.939 --> 11:53.801
Oh, shit!

11:53.342 --> 11:55.401
Shh.

12:02.551 --> 12:04.678
Shh.

12:20.101 --> 12:22.126
What do you think of The Factory?

12:22.170 --> 12:24.536
Do you like it here?

12:24.572 --> 12:27.598
Of course.

12:27.642 --> 12:31.510
I think it's always good to get beyond
your experiences, you know?

12:31.546 --> 12:35.414
And I hate it when people take
themselves too seriously.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.475
- Don't you?
- Oh, yeah.

12:41.790 --> 12:44.281
I read somewhere

12:44.325 --> 12:46.555
that you were born in California.
Is that true?

12:46.594 --> 12:49.586
Yes, but we were
from back East originally.

12:49.631 --> 12:52.930
Well, Fuzzy got sick.

12:52.967 --> 12:56.528
And so he wanted
to move to a warmer climate,

12:56.571 --> 13:00.337
and he bought a ranch
in Santa Barbara, California.

13:00.375 --> 13:02.468
And that's
where I was born.

13:02.510 --> 13:05.172
Who's Fuzzy?

13:05.213 --> 13:08.444
- Oh, Fuzzy's my father.
- Oh.

13:08.483 --> 13:11.543
My father.
Mm-hmm.

13:14.255 --> 13:16.849
And is Chuck
your best friend?

13:19.494 --> 13:22.054
He's my best girlfriend.

13:24.165 --> 13:26.133
Who's your best boyfriend?

13:26.167 --> 13:28.692
Oh, that's easy.
That would--

13:28.736 --> 13:30.704
actually,
it's not that easy.

13:32.574 --> 13:35.543
I would have to say
my brother Minty.

13:35.577 --> 13:39.206
Oh, well, you should
bring him over.

13:41.015 --> 13:43.108
I can't.
I wish I could.

13:46.087 --> 13:48.214
He's dead.

13:55.530 --> 13:58.966
Who is the first boy
you made it with?

13:59.000 --> 14:02.731
The first boy I made it with
was at Silver Hill.

14:04.506 --> 14:07.236
- The hospital?
- Mm-hmm.

14:07.275 --> 14:10.039
Oh, I hear it's very chic.

14:10.078 --> 14:13.605
Didn't Cornelia Vanderbilt
go there?

14:13.648 --> 14:16.446
All I had to do was walk in

14:16.484 --> 14:19.885
on Fuzzy fucking
our neighbor.

14:19.921 --> 14:22.913
And then when
I told my mother,

14:22.957 --> 14:26.552
well, Fuzzy said
that I was imagining it.

14:26.594 --> 14:28.323
There has to be
another way.

14:28.363 --> 14:31.662
But even after all the pills
that he pumped me up with,

14:31.699 --> 14:34.600
I knew what I saw.

14:34.636 --> 14:37.628
And so he sent me off
to Silver Hill

14:37.672 --> 14:41.108
just like he did with my brothers
Minty and Bobby.

14:41.142 --> 14:45.010
It was sort of
the Sedgwick way.

14:53.421 --> 14:55.446
Who was the first boy you ever kissed?

14:55.490 --> 14:57.219
Fuzzy.

15:06.558 --> 15:08.583
Silver Hill.

15:08.627 --> 15:11.687
I can't take it anymore.

15:12.930 --> 15:14.898
I want to die.

15:14.932 --> 15:17.093
Why do you want to die?

15:17.134 --> 15:20.831
Because my credit's
no good at Bonwit Teller.

15:20.872 --> 15:24.569
Because I just stole
$30 worth of underwear from Bergdorf's,

15:24.609 --> 15:26.440
and I think I might
do it again.

15:27.912 --> 15:30.278
Is that you, Edie?

15:30.314 --> 15:32.441
I thought you might
be lonely on the watch.

15:32.483 --> 15:33.541
Don't lie to Wanda.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.984
- I've known you for too long.
- But really, Wanda,

15:36.020 --> 15:37.920
everything is just super.

15:37.955 --> 15:40.355
I met the most
fantastic people.

15:40.391 --> 15:42.188
I went to this gallery.

15:42.226 --> 15:44.751
You know, Roy Lichtenstein
and Jasper Johns

15:44.795 --> 15:47.958
and Andy Warhol.
I may get a show there.

15:47.999 --> 15:51.332
Somebody asked me
to be in a movie, Wand.

15:51.369 --> 15:54.634
Wouldn't you love
to be in a movie?

15:54.672 --> 15:57.072
Are you still seeing a doctor?

16:06.020 --> 16:07.988
In today's news,

16:08.022 --> 16:09.922
rioting continued
in Alabama

16:09.957 --> 16:12.016
as civil rights demonstrators converged
on the courthouse steps

16:12.059 --> 16:13.856
in downtown Selma.

16:13.894 --> 16:17.227
Who could grant any wish.

16:17.264 --> 16:19.425
Andy was a little boy

16:19.466 --> 16:22.196
who needed
to be taken care of.

16:24.371 --> 16:27.306
I mean, his mother
moved in with him when he was 22.

16:27.341 --> 16:31.175
As a child, he had this horrible
nervous condition.

16:31.211 --> 16:34.078
- It made him feel like an outsider.
- Thanks, Mama.

16:39.153 --> 16:42.611
I like your Sunday
personality better.

16:55.803 --> 16:57.270
Hello?

16:57.304 --> 16:58.737
- Hello?
- Hello.

16:58.772 --> 17:01.866
Hello.
How are you, dear?

17:01.909 --> 17:03.900
Well, Andy, I'm just about ready
to flip my lid.

17:03.944 --> 17:06.674
Henry Winthorpe III
just left The Factory.

17:06.714 --> 17:09.308
Oh, the toothpaste heir?
How were his teeth?

17:09.350 --> 17:12.877
Oh, I didn't notice,
but his cock was beautiful.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.218
- Was it big?
- Listen.

17:24.031 --> 17:27.057
- Did he know you were taping him?
- He insisted.

17:27.101 --> 17:30.559
Andy, I'm getting
such good tapes.

17:37.277 --> 17:39.609
I don't care if she is wearing
a wig. It's a movie about boys.

17:39.647 --> 17:42.411
- It's supposed to be an all-male cast.
- But Edie looks like a boy.

17:42.449 --> 17:45.543
- Like a beautiful boy.
- And I think she's fantastic.

17:45.586 --> 17:49.022
But she shouldn't be in this.
It throws off the whole concept.

17:49.056 --> 17:51.786
It's supposed to be about thugs
and J.D.s and hooligans.

17:51.825 --> 17:53.952
Oh, I know.
I know.

17:53.994 --> 17:55.655
Is she gonna
say anything,

17:55.696 --> 17:57.857
or is she just gonna sit
there like a mannequin?

17:57.898 --> 17:59.832
I just don't think
she's cut out for this.

17:59.867 --> 18:02.961
Well, Gerard, maybe Edie doesn't think
you're cut out for it either.

18:03.003 --> 18:05.437
"Vinyl," a film by Andy Warhol

18:05.472 --> 18:08.032
starring Gerard Malanga.

18:29.063 --> 18:32.590
I'm a troublemaker. A hooligan.

18:32.633 --> 18:35.295
A real motherfucker.

18:35.335 --> 18:38.395
So if you got a problem,

18:38.439 --> 18:41.931
I can stick it where I can put it
whether you want it or not.

19:10.370 --> 19:13.134
Why is he doing that?

19:13.173 --> 19:15.767
Why doesn't he stop?

19:33.393 --> 19:35.384
In The Factory you were accepted

19:35.429 --> 19:37.363
and encouraged

19:37.397 --> 19:39.695
and even expected
to be different.

19:39.733 --> 19:42.634
Andy made me
feel comfortable,

19:42.669 --> 19:45.729
and I believe that
he felt comfortable with me.

19:48.075 --> 19:51.875
No, I'm serious. Let's say you're
on a TV show like "Steve Allen"

19:51.912 --> 19:54.904
and he says, "So, Edie, any plans
for getting married?"

19:54.948 --> 19:56.813
Okay, fine.

19:56.850 --> 19:59.944
But I could only marry four--
maybe three people.

19:59.987 --> 20:02.547
Who?

20:02.589 --> 20:05.524
The future Earl of Litchfield,
but he'll have to be the last, I think.

20:05.559 --> 20:08.323
- Oh.
- And Mick Jagger.

20:08.362 --> 20:11.388
Oh, yeah.
I hear he has a really big cock.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.198
- And then who?
- Nureyev.

20:15.235 --> 20:17.260
But I don't think
he likes women.

20:17.304 --> 20:19.499
Are you allowed
to say that on television?

20:19.540 --> 20:21.735
Oh, Andy, we couldn't say
anything on television.

20:21.775 --> 20:24.403
They'd have to tape
our mouths shut.

20:26.246 --> 20:28.771
It's so much more fun
in New York

20:28.816 --> 20:32.047
since you showed up.

20:58.412 --> 21:01.575
Those were really
the happiest days of my life.

21:01.615 --> 21:04.413
When we were experiencing life
on our own terms.

21:04.451 --> 21:07.682
What better way
to say goodbye

21:07.721 --> 21:10.952
to Edith Minturn Sedgwick,
the Mayflower girl.

21:16.196 --> 21:17.959
Andy, what do you think
of Edie's new look?

21:17.998 --> 21:20.262
It'll be great.
I can't wait to see it.

21:24.304 --> 21:28.001
Andy took ordinary
objects and made them iconic.

21:28.041 --> 21:32.808
I always thought that he was throwing
America back in its face--

21:32.846 --> 21:36.009
you know, turning the assembly
line into a punchline.

21:47.027 --> 21:50.121
Hello?

21:50.163 --> 21:51.562
Andy.

21:51.598 --> 21:53.463
When are you going
to show me your drawings?

21:53.500 --> 21:55.695
You've showed them
to Gerard and Brigid.

21:55.736 --> 21:57.795
I want them
to be the right ones.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.500
Well just put anything together.
We'll make a show.

22:00.540 --> 22:03.737
Ileana Sonnabend is coming to New York
next month. I'll introduce you.

22:03.777 --> 22:05.711
Really?

22:05.746 --> 22:07.805
I will.
This weekend I'll--

22:07.848 --> 22:10.749
Oh no, not this weekend. We're supposed
to go to Fire Island, remember?

22:10.784 --> 22:12.513
Well when am I supposed
to get it done?

22:12.552 --> 22:14.520
It'll happen.
I wouldn't worry about it.

22:14.554 --> 22:17.421
That's easy for you to say.
You have nothing to worry about.

22:17.457 --> 22:19.118
Oh, that's not true.

22:19.159 --> 22:21.559
The Sculls cancelled
a whole order of Brillo boxes.

22:21.595 --> 22:24.291
Andy, I know plenty
of people in New York

22:24.331 --> 22:26.561
who are looking
to buy great art.

22:26.667 --> 22:30.159
Edie, I just think
it will clash terribly

22:30.203 --> 22:31.795
with the Biedermeier chairs.

22:31.838 --> 22:33.965
Well you can just say
whatever color you want.

22:34.007 --> 22:36.475
I just picked up a new blue from Pearl
that's fantastic.

22:36.510 --> 22:38.375
Well, Mrs. Shingle,
just so you know,

22:38.412 --> 22:40.380
my mother had one
done last month,

22:40.414 --> 22:42.939
and she was so happy with it
she ordered three more.

22:42.983 --> 22:46.612
Wow, your mother always
did have excellent taste.

22:46.653 --> 22:49.622
Taupe I think
would work best.

23:03.470 --> 23:06.303
I wonder if people
are gonna remember us.

23:06.340 --> 23:08.069
What, when we're dead?

23:08.108 --> 23:10.133
Yeah.

23:10.177 --> 23:12.975
I think people will talk about how
you changed the world.

23:13.013 --> 23:15.277
I wonder what
they'll say about you

23:15.315 --> 23:17.510
in your obituary.
I like that word.

23:17.551 --> 23:19.075
Nothing nice, I don't think.

23:19.119 --> 23:21.280
Come on.
It would say...

23:21.321 --> 23:24.051
"Edith Minturn Sedgwick,

23:24.091 --> 23:26.025
beautiful artist
and actress..."

23:26.059 --> 23:28.027
"And all-around loon."

23:28.061 --> 23:30.529
"Remembered for setting
the world on fire..."

23:30.564 --> 23:33.465
"And escaping the clutches
of her terrifying family."

23:33.500 --> 23:36.799
"Made friends with everybody
and anybody..."

23:36.837 --> 23:40.398
"By creating chaos and uproar
wherever she went.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.499
Divorced as many times
as she married,

23:42.542 --> 23:45.102
she leaves only
good wishes behind."

23:48.248 --> 23:51.411
That's nice, isn't it?

23:51.451 --> 23:54.113
Well, I hope
I die first,

23:54.154 --> 23:56.315
because I would be too sad
if you died before me.

23:58.592 --> 24:01.117
Tell me other places
you lived after that.

24:01.161 --> 24:04.028
I lived in Paris
when I studied art.

24:04.064 --> 24:06.965
The French, they're
just so good looking.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.901
Andy, we should go.

24:09.936 --> 24:13.235
Actually, when I say it it makes sense
for you to be there right now.

24:13.273 --> 24:15.798
But I didn't think
they liked new art anymore.

24:15.842 --> 24:18.538
You just take some of the flower
paintings and the movies,

24:18.578 --> 24:22.275
and they'd appreciate
you so much more than they do here.

24:22.315 --> 24:25.910
You know, here people don't really know
why you do what you do.

24:25.952 --> 24:27.681
But in Paris,
they don't care.

24:27.721 --> 24:30.588
So you're free to express it
however you want.

24:30.624 --> 24:32.455
Well, they only care
that you know why.

24:32.492 --> 24:34.426
Oh, well I just do it
because I'm ugly

24:34.461 --> 24:36.292
and there's nothing
else for me to do.

24:36.329 --> 24:38.695
You're not ugly, Andy.

24:38.732 --> 24:41.724
Well, I do have my good days.

24:41.768 --> 24:44.202
Three shrimp cocktails,

24:44.237 --> 24:45.795
extra lemon,
extra cocktail.

24:45.839 --> 24:48.034
And then I'll have
the salmon grilled. Is it fresh?

24:48.075 --> 24:50.703
- Oh yes, ma'am.
- No butter, but extra parsley.

24:50.744 --> 24:52.769
- Ooh, and lots of Russian dressing.
- $200?

24:52.813 --> 24:54.144
And you?

24:54.181 --> 24:56.445
Oh, I'll just have
a peanut butter sandwich.

24:56.483 --> 24:57.950
I'll see what I can do.

24:57.984 --> 25:00.111
- Put everybody on my tab.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:00.153 --> 25:01.984
I don't understand.
These are all your bills?

25:02.022 --> 25:04.855
I know, they're huge.
You might have to start paying me.

25:04.891 --> 25:08.588
Either that or I'll have to move into
a one-bedroom or a studio.

25:08.628 --> 25:11.222
Oh God, where would
I keep all my clothes in a studio, Andy?

25:11.264 --> 25:13.562
- What should I do?
- Oh, nothing.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.797
I just think what you're doing right now
is so glamorous.

25:16.837 --> 25:18.668
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:26.580 --> 25:28.673
Darling, where did you get that blouse?
It's simply divine.

25:28.715 --> 25:31.479
- It's Donald Brooks.
- Hmm.

25:31.518 --> 25:35.113
Here, try it on.
We're about the same size.

25:36.556 --> 25:38.353
There I was in the midst of hara-kiri

25:38.391 --> 25:40.222
when it hit me--

25:40.260 --> 25:42.490
24 hours in the life
of Edie.

25:42.529 --> 25:45.430
One day.
One movie.

25:45.465 --> 25:48.127
You are so much fun. How come you don't
spend more time with us?

25:48.168 --> 25:51.137
- Because of my lips.
- Your lips?

25:51.171 --> 25:53.696
They have a hard time
kissing Andy Warhol's ass.

25:53.740 --> 25:55.970
- Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah?

25:56.009 --> 25:57.704
- Yeah.
- Right?

25:57.744 --> 25:59.541
How well do you and Edie
speak French?

26:12.785 --> 26:15.618
Well, I don't know.
I guess I'm bored with it.

26:15.655 --> 26:18.419
So I'm just going to
quit painting

26:18.458 --> 26:21.586
and we're going to
make movies now.

26:21.628 --> 26:23.960
Make Edie a big star.

26:29.903 --> 26:33.304
Well, I'm not going.

26:33.339 --> 26:35.432
I have nothing to wear.

26:35.475 --> 26:37.136
Why don't you just
try on some clothes?

26:37.176 --> 26:41.237
I don't feel like trying on--
Why do I have to try on clothes?

26:41.281 --> 26:43.408
You have a whole closetful.

26:43.449 --> 26:45.610
Do I look different?

26:48.721 --> 26:51.121
I ran into an old friend
who said every time I saw him

26:51.157 --> 26:53.421
I looked so different
he hardly knew who I was.

26:53.459 --> 26:56.223
Well, do you think
that's true?

26:56.262 --> 26:59.254
Huh?

26:59.299 --> 27:01.733
Edie Sedgwick

27:01.768 --> 27:03.963
in Andy Warhol's
"Poor Little Rich Girl."

27:06.205 --> 27:07.763
Bravo!

27:20.053 --> 27:22.954
Oh, that's so nice.

27:33.199 --> 27:35.963
I just love that
he doesn't speak any English.

27:36.002 --> 27:39.199
Aru, I want
to touch your cock.

27:39.238 --> 27:41.638
- Oui, Andy. Oui.
- Oui. Isn't he great?

27:41.674 --> 27:45.075
I can't tell what he's saying, but he
keeps talking about Edie.

27:48.181 --> 27:50.706
Just take your pants down.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.344
Andy, critics may love you in France,

27:53.386 --> 27:55.115
but here they say
your work is superficial

27:55.154 --> 27:56.883
and that you wouldn't be
where you are without Edie.

27:56.923 --> 27:58.686
I don't pay attention
to what they write.

27:58.725 --> 28:01.626
I just measure it in inches.

28:01.661 --> 28:04.391
Edie, I understand
you're an artist too.

28:04.430 --> 28:06.421
That was a very long time ago.

28:06.466 --> 28:08.024
Edie's too beautiful
to be an artist.

28:08.067 --> 28:10.729
I think artists should be ugly.

28:10.770 --> 28:12.601
No, Edie's a superstar.

28:12.638 --> 28:13.969
Superstar.

28:21.314 --> 28:22.406
That's crazy.

28:22.448 --> 28:24.040
There's one more thing
on the sidewalk.

28:24.083 --> 28:26.347
Look at that.

28:26.386 --> 28:28.820
Oh, that's what he said.

28:28.855 --> 28:30.413
I got it.

28:30.456 --> 28:34.187
It's like a madhouse in here.
Andy, this is my mother, Alice!

28:34.227 --> 28:36.161
She just flew into town
to help me furnish.

28:36.195 --> 28:39.062
Oh, hi.
You're so beautiful.

28:39.098 --> 28:41.760
It's so nice to meet you.

28:41.801 --> 28:44.702
No no!
Put it over there.

28:44.737 --> 28:47.399
Careful with that box, love.
It's Waterford.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.806
Betsy Johnson--
I know, isn't she fabulous?

28:49.842 --> 28:51.639
She asked me
to be her first model.

28:51.677 --> 28:53.804
Anyway, I've got to go.
Ciao.

28:54.555 --> 28:57.183
Oh, Mum-mum
aren't you proud

28:57.225 --> 28:59.853
Pretty soon money will
be falling off trees.

28:59.894 --> 29:03.261
- I won't need any help at all.
- There's a novel idea.

29:03.297 --> 29:06.425
But, Mom, don't you think that Fuzzy
would get a kick out of all of this?

29:06.467 --> 29:09.630
Oh, please. Your father's so square
he doesn't pee in the shower.

29:09.671 --> 29:13.198
Mum-mum!

29:15.777 --> 29:17.506
Hello?

29:17.545 --> 29:21.072
I think your daughter
is going to be super famous.

29:21.115 --> 29:24.881
And what would
be the value in that, Mr. Warhol?

29:24.919 --> 29:28.753
Oh, well, I think everybody
wants to be famous.

29:30.291 --> 29:33.385
Well, I had much
higher hopes for Edith.

29:33.428 --> 29:35.760
Oh.

29:36.933 --> 29:39.493
You know,
I used to dance twice a day.

29:39.536 --> 29:40.935
I'd do this jazz ballet.

29:40.970 --> 29:43.632
And I'd wear leotards
and black tights

29:43.673 --> 29:45.868
and I was too lazy
to take them off.

29:47.277 --> 29:49.745
And I decided
to go with it.

29:49.779 --> 29:51.474
Divine one,

29:51.514 --> 29:55.041
I am entirely superficial
and I intend to stay that way.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.110
But you, my dear,
you are the real thing.

29:57.153 --> 29:59.280
America's next "It" girl.

29:59.322 --> 30:01.950
We'll put you
under contract.

30:01.991 --> 30:05.791
People started to notice
and it sort of caught on.

30:07.664 --> 30:10.030
You know, the earrings,
the thick black eyelashes--

30:10.066 --> 30:11.499
it was all
a part of the show.

30:24.514 --> 30:26.880
This is Andrea Romando
with the BBC.

30:26.916 --> 30:30.682
I'm here with Edie Sedgwick
at the infamous Factory.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.280
She is known
as Andy Warhol's superstar.

30:33.323 --> 30:36.815
And in New York, she has been dubbed
Queen of Underground Cinema.

30:36.860 --> 30:40.455
Edie, how does your family feel about
you having this title?

30:43.166 --> 30:44.656
They hate it.

30:44.701 --> 30:47.431
They hated the idea
of my doing any modeling

30:47.470 --> 30:50.303
to make my own way.

30:50.340 --> 30:52.706
As soon as I started all of this,
they're sending telegrams

30:52.742 --> 30:56.041
saying, "Oh, you've got to go
model, please."

30:56.079 --> 30:58.912
At an Andy Warhol art exhibition...

30:58.948 --> 31:00.882
The glamorous Miss Edie
Sedgwick unraveled her long white...

31:00.917 --> 31:04.250
The Plymouth Rock
princess and her commoner companion...

31:04.287 --> 31:06.755
...in town last night,
at Max's Kansas City...

31:06.790 --> 31:09.816
...Hollywood legends...

31:09.859 --> 31:12.020
...the former window
dresser and commercial artist...

31:12.061 --> 31:14.086
...the first girl to bring sex appeal

31:14.130 --> 31:15.427
to American high society.

31:19.302 --> 31:21.395
I'll have a porterhouse,
she'll do the sirloin.

31:21.437 --> 31:24.463
Actually, I think I'll
try the chicken tonight.

31:24.507 --> 31:26.532
Coq au vin, please.

31:26.576 --> 31:29.943
- Miss Sedgwick?
- Why don't you have the grilled fish?

31:29.979 --> 31:32.948
No butter. We don't want you blowing up
now, do we, honey?

31:32.982 --> 31:35.109
You game
for a steak, Warhol?

31:35.151 --> 31:36.550
You sure look like
you could use one.

31:41.291 --> 31:44.226
The Met is thinking
of buying some of Andy's work.

31:44.260 --> 31:46.125
- Oh, lovely.
- How about this?

31:46.162 --> 31:49.563
I've just been commissioned
for a 30-foot bronze stallion

31:49.599 --> 31:51.624
in downtown Santa Barbara.

31:51.668 --> 31:53.533
Oh, Edie does horses too.

31:53.570 --> 31:56.971
Well, where do you think
she learned that?

31:57.006 --> 31:59.566
Has Edie told you
about my studio?

31:59.609 --> 32:01.099
Yeah.

32:01.144 --> 32:03.612
I've seen some
of your work, Warhol.

32:03.646 --> 32:05.477
You're really more
of a printmaker than an artist.

32:05.515 --> 32:07.107
What's your family do?

32:09.452 --> 32:12.114
Well, my father
was in a coal mine.

32:13.756 --> 32:16.623
Andy and I are thinking about making
some more movies together.

32:16.659 --> 32:18.559
If you can call them that.

32:18.595 --> 32:21.655
You can call them whatever you want.

32:21.698 --> 32:25.293
- Like Dorothy, or...
- Ondine.

32:25.335 --> 32:27.326
Hillary.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.734
This whole time
I'm thinking,

32:31.774 --> 32:34.641
"Who is this guy who has my little girl
all turned around?

32:34.677 --> 32:37.771
He must be
some kind of a man."

32:38.815 --> 32:40.578
Then I talk to you
for two minutes,

32:40.617 --> 32:43.677
and I have to smile, because I don't
have a thing to worry about, do I?

32:43.720 --> 32:45.847
You're a full-blown queer.

32:48.658 --> 32:50.421
Andy, we can go now.

32:50.460 --> 32:51.984
Edith...

32:52.028 --> 32:54.394
don't you dare
make a scene.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.739
Minty had been...

33:18.888 --> 33:21.152
I guess an embarrassment
to the family

33:21.190 --> 33:23.522
because he was different.
He was...

33:26.029 --> 33:28.020
he was a homosexual.

33:30.633 --> 33:32.225
And Fuzzy knew it.

33:32.268 --> 33:36.102
And when Minty came clean,
Fuzzy called him a faggot.

33:37.740 --> 33:40.140
You know, he just--

33:40.176 --> 33:41.666
he broke him.

33:43.947 --> 33:47.212
And when they closed the casket lid
on my brother Minty...

33:49.419 --> 33:52.320
I remember Fuzzy
just standing there.

33:56.225 --> 33:59.854
No reaction, just...

33:59.896 --> 34:02.490
standing there...

34:03.967 --> 34:05.832
like a stone.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.776
And at his funeral,
no one cried.

34:11.684 --> 34:13.675
No one.

34:15.935 --> 34:17.926
I--

34:17.970 --> 34:20.598
I had to cry
for all of them.

34:27.512 --> 34:30.242
Oh, you made it.
That's great. Oh, hi.

34:30.281 --> 34:32.476
Look who's here,
everybody. Hi.

34:32.517 --> 34:34.348
Hey, Mick, how are you?

34:34.385 --> 34:36.717
Oh, it's great to have you here.
I love the album.

34:39.090 --> 34:41.285
- Jesus, Richie.
- The tissue's hardened, Brig.

34:41.325 --> 34:43.520
You got to really push.

34:44.896 --> 34:47.797
Hey, Brig. What are
you girls up to?

34:47.832 --> 34:49.356
Cocktails, darling.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.527
Adderall, Digoxin
and Dextromethamphetamine.

34:51.569 --> 34:54.060
Has certainly more kick
than a martini, no?

34:54.105 --> 34:55.766
You go to med school, Brig?

34:55.806 --> 34:59.139
My parents have had me
doped up on diet pills since I was 10.

34:59.176 --> 35:02.168
Well, my parents plopped me in the bins
before I could drive.

35:02.213 --> 35:04.078
You're an Aquarius,
aren't you?

35:04.115 --> 35:05.548
No, I'm an Aries.

35:05.583 --> 35:08.381
I know an Aquarius
when I see one.

35:08.419 --> 35:10.819
I just adore Aquariuses.

35:12.757 --> 35:14.748
You thirsty for a poke?
It's divine.

35:16.127 --> 35:18.254
Ooh.

35:38.085 --> 35:41.311
Speed was rocket fuel.

35:41.318 --> 35:43.129
It was the only way to keep up

35:43.130 --> 35:47.507
and that was really
the great temptation of the Factory.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.678
It was at perpetual party

35:49.679 --> 35:53.064
in one i was happy
to loose myself in.

35:56.172 --> 35:58.800
Hey, Rich, did you see
my mother's face when she met Andy?

35:58.842 --> 36:00.469
I thought
she was gonna burst.

36:00.510 --> 36:02.273
I know, my mother's
horrified.

36:02.312 --> 36:04.507
Brig keeps threatening to invite
him to Christmas dinner

36:04.547 --> 36:06.447
if she doesn't
up our allowances.

36:06.483 --> 36:08.451
Well, no wonder you never
run out of money.

36:08.485 --> 36:10.919
Edie.

36:12.188 --> 36:15.351
Syd! What are you
doing here?

36:16.927 --> 36:19.259
- I've been sent to find you.
- Oh, that sounds mysterious.

36:19.296 --> 36:21.856
- Who sent you, the Red Chinese?
- No, but...

36:23.366 --> 36:25.766
I am working
for someone pretty big.

36:25.802 --> 36:28.600
- Rockefeller?
- Bigger.

36:28.638 --> 36:31.903
Bigger than Rockefeller
and the Red Chinese?

36:31.942 --> 36:33.534
Well, pray tell, who?

36:33.576 --> 36:37.342
Why don't you come with me
and I'll show you.

36:41.985 --> 36:43.452
Who's that?

36:43.486 --> 36:45.681
- Taxi!
- Oh, darling, I landed straight down

36:45.722 --> 36:47.053
on my
Margaret Jarrold pumps.

36:47.090 --> 36:49.115
Thank God
I didn't break an ankle.

36:49.847 --> 36:52.020
Second Avenue and Fifth, please.

36:52.156 --> 36:54.624
That was just my great escape.
Do you remember that time

36:54.658 --> 36:56.956
when we went to that restaurant--
oh, what was it called?

36:56.994 --> 36:59.087
Durgin Park in Faneuil Hall.

36:59.129 --> 37:01.962
And all the waiters were so crusty,
and-- oh!

37:01.999 --> 37:04.467
Watch it.
Watch it! Jesus.

37:04.501 --> 37:06.298
And then I was dancing on the tables,
do you remember?

37:06.336 --> 37:08.167
And I think that they thought
that I stole something,

37:08.205 --> 37:09.968
when really I only
meant to borrow it.

37:10.007 --> 37:11.634
Oh no, it wasn't you!

37:11.675 --> 37:13.142
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:13.177 --> 37:15.338
It was Don-Don.
And Chuckie was there.

37:15.379 --> 37:18.507
- Edie.
- I nearly died laughing.

37:18.549 --> 37:21.109
Edie, I have somebody
that I want you to meet.

37:21.151 --> 37:22.584
This is Edie Sedgwick.

37:22.619 --> 37:24.746
Edie, how about a picture?

37:24.788 --> 37:26.779
Well, hello.

37:30.460 --> 37:33.793
Why don't you put
your arm around her?

37:33.831 --> 37:36.231
Hey, how about one shot?
One shot, Miss Sedgwick?

37:38.235 --> 37:39.896
I got to go to work,
sweetheart.

37:52.933 --> 37:56.425
Well, I wasn't interested
in him because he was famous.

37:56.470 --> 37:59.928
It wasn't as if he was
the first famous person I'd ever met.

37:59.973 --> 38:03.534
But he was so different.

38:14.730 --> 38:17.300
- It`s just a bird.
- No, no, no, that`s...

38:17.301 --> 38:20.126
that`s really good.

38:21.261 --> 38:25.760
So, Syd and I caught a couple of your
films last week at the Cinemateque.

38:26.315 --> 38:29.944
You did?
Really? And?

38:31.258 --> 38:34.659
We just-- well, we didn't really
understand what they meant.

38:35.263 --> 38:39.639
I don't think that it really
mean anything necessarily.

38:40.784 --> 38:42.718
What about you?

38:42.853 --> 38:46.186
Your songs are pretty--
pretty profound.

38:46.223 --> 38:47.884
What are you trying to say?

38:49.927 --> 38:52.020
I'm not-- I'm not trying
to say anything.

38:53.764 --> 38:57.063
I sing about what I see.

38:59.113 --> 39:01.633
He represented
everything that Andy didn`t

39:02.097 --> 39:06.369
and I just really
wanted to free myself.

39:10.933 --> 39:12.730
The music was just hypnotic.

39:12.769 --> 39:15.465
- I just think he's so maximal.
- Isn't he?

39:15.505 --> 39:18.201
And he just has that power.
You know people who have that power.

39:18.241 --> 39:20.436
- Like Superman?
- You can't really explain why it is.

39:20.476 --> 39:22.535
It just is.

39:22.578 --> 39:25.479
Well, what do you say to someone
like that? I mean, he's just so famous.

39:25.515 --> 39:27.642
- We didn't really talk, you know.
- Oh, you didn't?

39:27.684 --> 39:29.447
It was just nice to meet him.
Andy, what do you think of this?

39:29.485 --> 39:31.476
Tres chic or tres fou?

39:31.521 --> 39:33.512
Oh, tres chic,
definitely.

39:33.556 --> 39:36.753
Well, I have to watch my spending.
Especially on clothes.

39:36.793 --> 39:38.488
You know, I already
stopped wearing underwear.

39:38.528 --> 39:40.894
Shit, what other sacrifices
do I have to make?

39:40.930 --> 39:43.057
Who do you think you are?

39:43.099 --> 39:45.966
Your family is so rich.

39:46.002 --> 39:48.766
I mean, you're living
on Easy Street.

39:48.805 --> 39:51.740
Oh!

39:51.774 --> 39:53.605
Oh, Mama would love this.

39:53.643 --> 39:55.076
I can buy it for you.

39:55.111 --> 39:57.136
Oh no, you need
to watch your spending.

39:57.180 --> 40:00.411
So, tell me more things.
Who else was he there with?

40:00.450 --> 40:02.577
I don't really remember that,
you know?

40:02.618 --> 40:04.245
But it was just something
about those lyrics.

40:04.287 --> 40:06.812
What he was saying
was really poignant.

40:06.856 --> 40:08.517
Like he really
had something to say.

40:08.558 --> 40:10.219
What?

40:10.259 --> 40:13.092
I was just saying
that he really had something to say.

40:13.129 --> 40:15.063
- How much is this?
- Seven.

40:15.098 --> 40:16.929
- $7?
- $7.

40:16.966 --> 40:18.263
Oh no, that's too much.

40:20.103 --> 40:22.367
Well, I could
give you $4.

40:26.752 --> 40:29.346
James, dear, what are you
doing here so early?

40:29.388 --> 40:31.322
- I...
- Sit down.

40:31.357 --> 40:34.758
We had an appointment at my office
at noon, Miss Sedgwick. It's 2:30.

40:34.794 --> 40:37.695
You've known me since
I was three, James. Call me Edie.

40:37.730 --> 40:40.824
Your...

40:40.867 --> 40:42.767
spending, Miss Sedgwick.

40:42.802 --> 40:44.770
You're going to be
bankrupt soon.

40:44.804 --> 40:47.170
James, you take life
too seriously.

40:47.206 --> 40:49.106
How could I possibly
be bankrupt?

40:49.142 --> 40:51.007
My grandfather
invented the elevator.

40:51.043 --> 40:54.376
Then you should be familiar
with the concept of up and down.

40:54.413 --> 40:57.814
When you got here,
your trust fund--

40:57.850 --> 40:59.147
thank you.

40:59.185 --> 41:01.949
Your trust fund was up.

41:03.689 --> 41:07.125
After a year and a half,
it's almost in the basement.

41:09.328 --> 41:12.786
- Oh shit.
- What, what, what?

41:12.832 --> 41:15.027
Well, what about all
the money that I'm making?

41:15.067 --> 41:17.194
Well,
you keep spending it.

41:19.238 --> 41:21.103
Your father
is very upset with you

41:21.140 --> 41:23.506
cavorting with drug addicts

41:23.543 --> 41:25.340
and fringe elements.

41:25.378 --> 41:28.404
You tell Fuzzy for me that those are
some very talented people.

41:28.447 --> 41:30.711
If you don't
change your friends,

41:30.750 --> 41:32.945
you'll get nothing from him.

41:35.221 --> 41:36.848
Rich, will you make sure
the oven's off?

41:36.889 --> 41:38.880
I'm sorry, I have to go.

42:01.380 --> 42:04.247
Oh, looks like Cupid's
been busy as a bull dyke.

42:04.283 --> 42:06.274
You look beautiful, honey.

42:08.588 --> 42:10.954
Hello.

42:10.990 --> 42:12.651
What are you doing?

42:12.692 --> 42:14.683
Thought you weren't
gonna paint any more.

42:16.429 --> 42:18.397
Oh, look, it's Judy Garland.

42:18.431 --> 42:21.229
Wouldn't it be funny if it turned out
she was really a man?

42:21.267 --> 42:22.825
Wouldn't it be funny if it turned out

42:22.868 --> 42:24.358
Gerard was really a man?

42:24.403 --> 42:25.870
When you get through sucking on that,

42:25.905 --> 42:27.566
come over
and see for yourself.

42:27.607 --> 42:31.099
Only if I can record the slurps.

42:31.143 --> 42:35.045
Oh, Andy, Sam called. He's sending
a limo for us for the show tonight.

42:35.081 --> 42:36.548
I hear rock stars like limos.

42:39.518 --> 42:42.578
I think it's just delicious
that Edie has a boyfriend.

42:42.622 --> 42:44.817
I'm not looking
for anything like that.

42:44.857 --> 42:46.848
Okay.

42:52.598 --> 42:55.362
Don't be jealous, Andy.
He's nothing like you.

42:55.401 --> 42:59.098
Oh no, I'm not. I've just never made it
with a rock star before.

42:59.138 --> 43:00.867
- It must be neat.
- I'm not making it--

43:00.906 --> 43:03.841
Why do you do that?
Why do you have to make me feel guilty?

43:03.876 --> 43:06.344
I hate it when people
make me feel bad.

43:06.379 --> 43:08.847
Well, you lied to me.
You said you didn't talk to him.

43:08.881 --> 43:10.974
- And then that picture in the paper...
- Andy, this is absurd.

43:11.017 --> 43:12.746
It was a photograph.

43:12.785 --> 43:15.345
You know, we barely met.
You meet people all the time.

43:15.388 --> 43:17.117
Do you fuck them?

43:17.156 --> 43:20.819
Well, I just think sex
is too abstract anyway.

43:33.708 --> 43:35.403
Andy, what do you think
about the war in Vietnam?

43:35.443 --> 43:37.570
I don't know. Ask Edie.
What do you think, Edie?

43:37.612 --> 43:40.137
Well, we prefer
"I Dream of Jeannie."

43:40.181 --> 43:41.648
Andy, in the story of your life,

43:41.682 --> 43:43.343
who would you want
to play Andy Warhol?

43:43.384 --> 43:45.875
Oh, Edie. She's so perfect.
She does everything better than me.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.480
- Hi.
- Hello.

43:48.522 --> 43:50.786
Andy, I need
to talk to you.

43:50.825 --> 43:52.656
I've gotten myself
into a little pickle

43:52.693 --> 43:55.491
and I was just wondering if you could
maybe pay me for some of my work?

43:55.529 --> 43:57.258
Edie, you know the movies
haven't made any money yet.

43:57.298 --> 43:58.765
So you just need
to be patient.

43:58.799 --> 44:01.063
Well, I can't be patient.
I have nothing to live on.

44:01.102 --> 44:02.729
- Andy, you and I both know...
- Sam.

44:02.770 --> 44:04.761
...that you are
never giving up painting.

44:04.805 --> 44:07.035
You've just been saying that
to get publicity.

44:07.074 --> 44:09.065
- Well, guess what?
- What?

44:09.110 --> 44:11.169
- It worked.
- Great.

44:11.212 --> 44:13.737
Come on, everyone
wants to meet you.

44:13.781 --> 44:15.772
This way.

44:26.994 --> 44:29.724
Hello, kitty-kat.

44:29.764 --> 44:33.200
Hello.

44:33.234 --> 44:35.566
That's a wonderful scarf.

44:35.603 --> 44:37.935
Thank you.
Left my tux in the shop.

44:39.540 --> 44:41.235
You here to buy a painting?

44:42.777 --> 44:46.269
Tell me, why are all these cats gonna
pay a fortune for a soup can?

44:46.313 --> 44:47.712
I mean...

44:47.748 --> 44:50.216
You just have to look
beyond the obvious.

44:50.251 --> 44:52.583
Am I stupid, or...

44:52.620 --> 44:54.588
I don't get it.
Am I stupid?

44:54.622 --> 44:57.648
You're being a little stupid.
I mean, don't you think it's intriguing?

44:57.692 --> 44:59.250
Not just a little bit?

44:59.293 --> 45:02.194
You know, it may
just be a painting,

45:02.229 --> 45:04.629
but it's an idea.

45:04.665 --> 45:07.828
And the man behind that idea
is what's interesting.

45:09.303 --> 45:13.364
I think the man has got his priorities
all out of whack.

45:14.709 --> 45:17.177
Whole world's burning up
and this cat's making...

45:17.211 --> 45:19.372
gods out of garbage.

45:19.413 --> 45:20.903
Well, the whole world
may be burning up,

45:20.948 --> 45:23.644
but that doesn't mean
that we have to be cynical.

45:24.933 --> 45:27.299
Got the whole world on
a string, don't you?

45:29.204 --> 45:32.537
But inside there...

45:32.574 --> 45:35.634
well, it's as empty
as your friend's soup can.

45:43.318 --> 45:46.219
I'll see you around...

45:47.555 --> 45:49.546
superstar.

45:59.801 --> 46:02.531
Well, you're just so smart, Chuck.

46:02.570 --> 46:04.265
I just think you should
start directing.

46:04.305 --> 46:06.205
I mean, you do
the camera so good.

46:06.241 --> 46:09.142
We always need people
like you just to make things happen.

46:09.177 --> 46:12.044
Well, I mean, I'm really
just here for Edie, you know?

46:12.080 --> 46:14.844
Oh. Well, it's just such a pity

46:14.883 --> 46:17.249
that she should get all the attention
when you're the one who found her.

46:20.655 --> 46:22.179
I hope she still wants
to do more movies.

46:22.223 --> 46:23.485
She does.

46:23.525 --> 46:25.083
We-- we do,
we love movies.

46:25.126 --> 46:26.684
I mean, in fact,
I had this--

46:26.728 --> 46:29.253
I just don't know
if she's being...

46:29.297 --> 46:31.561
well, I mean, you know her
better than me.

46:31.599 --> 46:33.829
But, it seems like when
the camera's on sometimes

46:33.868 --> 46:35.301
she just doesn't seem...

46:37.005 --> 46:40.406
I don't know, I just wouldn't
want it to be disappointing.

46:40.442 --> 46:41.602
It won't.

46:41.643 --> 46:44.203
I can have her say
anything you want.

46:44.245 --> 46:46.873
She trusts me more
than anyone.

46:46.915 --> 46:48.610
Oh.

46:58.751 --> 47:02.517
"Beauty Number Two,"
an Andy Warhol production.

47:02.555 --> 47:05.888
Daddy, will you
pass me my martini?

47:06.892 --> 47:09.486
- Edie?
- Yes, Chuckles?

47:10.796 --> 47:13.094
Chuckles-- didn't I
give you that name?

47:13.132 --> 47:15.896
Edie, do you
like horses?

47:15.935 --> 47:18.335
Horses have whiskers.

47:18.370 --> 47:21.305
Yes, horses.
Do you ride?

47:21.340 --> 47:24.832
Since I was a little girl,
I've just adored them.

47:24.877 --> 47:27.345
Daddy taught me to ride
before I could walk.

47:27.379 --> 47:28.471
My first horse...

47:28.514 --> 47:30.948
Your father was
a handsome man?

47:30.983 --> 47:33.577
Oh, Fuzzy?

47:33.619 --> 47:35.644
He still is.

47:35.688 --> 47:38.885
How about your brothers? They were
quite attractive, too, weren't they?

47:38.924 --> 47:41.722
They must have had
a lot of women then.

47:41.760 --> 47:44.320
Wha--?

47:44.363 --> 47:46.888
Did they find
you attractive?

47:46.932 --> 47:50.026
Of course.
I was their family.

47:50.069 --> 47:52.936
Did you find them
attractive?

47:56.475 --> 47:59.273
- Do you...
- Can you change the question?

47:59.311 --> 48:03.111
find Gino attractive? That's-- that's
what I was going to ask you, Edie.

48:03.148 --> 48:05.878
Gino?

48:05.918 --> 48:08.716
He's devastatingly handsome,
isn't he?

48:08.754 --> 48:10.312
Kiss him.

48:15.661 --> 48:17.754
Are you scared?

48:28.507 --> 48:30.031
Come on, Edie.
Like you mean it.

48:40.519 --> 48:43.545
Gino, she likes when
you get rough.

48:43.589 --> 48:46.319
She likes those tough men.

48:46.358 --> 48:49.156
Strong men are what turn you on,
isn't that right, babycakes?

48:49.194 --> 48:50.422
No.

48:50.462 --> 48:53.295
Not like
your brother, Minty.

48:53.332 --> 48:56.028
Your father wasn't
so keen on him, was he?

48:57.236 --> 48:59.431
Who was he keen on? You?

49:01.407 --> 49:03.807
Okay, get off!
Enough!

49:14.787 --> 49:16.584
Andy, are we finished?

49:16.622 --> 49:19.113
No, Edie,
we're still rolling.

49:27.906 --> 49:30.306
Sedgwick.

49:36.915 --> 49:38.678
Edie Sedgwick!

49:39.851 --> 49:41.785
Hello.

50:38.816 --> 50:40.943
How'd a nice chick
like you get mixed up

50:40.985 --> 50:42.816
in the whole
acting racket?

50:42.853 --> 50:45.481
It was
"Breakfast At Tiffany's."

50:46.957 --> 50:50.017
You know that poster with Audrey
and her hair's pulled back

50:50.061 --> 50:52.791
and she's smoking through
the black cigarette holder?

50:54.598 --> 50:56.122
You want to live
in a movie?

50:56.167 --> 50:58.499
I never saw
the movie.

50:58.536 --> 51:00.834
So then you haven't
read the book, huh?

51:00.871 --> 51:03.499
Well, Audrey
isn't in the book.

51:04.809 --> 51:07.107
Book's a bit different.

51:08.946 --> 51:11.608
Book's about a working girl

51:11.649 --> 51:13.344
and a writer.

51:13.384 --> 51:15.784
An artist.

51:15.820 --> 51:19.916
You see, the artist steals
the girl's stories,

51:19.957 --> 51:22.858
makes a fortune,

51:22.893 --> 51:25.259
and the girl doesn't
get anything.

51:27.598 --> 51:31.329
Why do you have
such a problem with Andy?

51:31.368 --> 51:33.302
Because of what
he worships.

51:33.337 --> 51:36.829
And what about you? I mean,
I saw your face in those flashbulbs.

51:36.874 --> 51:39.707
You pretend to be
some sort of crusader,

51:39.744 --> 51:41.678
but I saw you
basking in it.

51:41.712 --> 51:44.044
Oh, don't get us confused,
sister, all right?

51:44.081 --> 51:46.015
Those bulbs, they get
a message out.

51:46.050 --> 51:48.848
What-- what exactly
is the message...

51:48.886 --> 51:51.184
aside from
"Look at me"?

51:53.023 --> 51:55.253
Nah, I'm just
a guitar player.

51:55.292 --> 51:56.691
- That's all.
- No no.

51:56.727 --> 52:00.185
You're an overpaid prophet
and I'm a poor little rich girl.

52:01.932 --> 52:04.400
Lady, you don't know
shit about shit.

52:04.435 --> 52:07.461
Open your eyes, you know? Take a look
at the world around you, okay?

52:07.505 --> 52:09.905
- It's very easy for you to say that...
- It's not all Park Avenue.

52:09.940 --> 52:11.874
- You do know that, don't you?
- ...from your wonderful,

52:11.909 --> 52:14.139
very glorified position
where you have your cars

52:14.178 --> 52:15.873
and your houses
and your fucking bike.

52:15.913 --> 52:17.471
You think I give a shit
about any of this?

52:17.515 --> 52:19.608
- I think it's obvious you do.
- You think I actually care?

52:19.650 --> 52:21.777
It's not real, babe.

52:44.608 --> 52:46.633
- Big house, huh?
- Big house.

52:46.677 --> 52:48.770
- Big family, too?
- Big family.

52:48.813 --> 52:50.804
Tell me about
your house.

52:50.848 --> 52:52.406
Mmm.

52:55.052 --> 52:57.748
We lived on a ranch.
We lived on two ranches

52:57.788 --> 52:59.255
in California.

52:59.290 --> 53:01.224
- Two ranches?
- Two ranches with--

53:01.258 --> 53:02.657
Must have been
a big family.

53:02.693 --> 53:04.354
It was a big family.
We had horses

53:04.395 --> 53:06.363
and cattle and we had--

53:06.397 --> 53:08.388
Lots of brothers
and sisters?

53:08.432 --> 53:11.424
We had eight brothers
and sisters.

53:11.468 --> 53:14.665
Now I have six
brothers and sisters.

53:16.907 --> 53:19.273
Well, what happened
to the other two?

53:21.378 --> 53:24.074
Minty...

53:25.950 --> 53:28.043
hanged himself

53:28.085 --> 53:30.053
at a place
called Silver Hill,

53:30.087 --> 53:32.146
which was sort of...

53:32.189 --> 53:34.350
a rehabilitation center.

53:34.391 --> 53:37.827
And Bobby...

53:37.862 --> 53:40.763
- Jesus.
- ...who was my elder brother

53:40.798 --> 53:43.767
ran his bike into a bus
on Fifth Avenue.

53:46.570 --> 53:49.698
But the funny thing
was was that I was in a--

53:49.740 --> 53:53.471
a car accident on the same--
it was New Year's Eve,

53:53.510 --> 53:57.344
and I-- well, he died,

53:57.381 --> 54:00.782
and-- and I didn't die.

54:00.818 --> 54:02.843
Babe.

55:52.062 --> 55:53.825
I was out with a couple
of heavies tonight.

55:53.864 --> 55:55.354
We talked about you
all evening.

55:55.399 --> 55:56.832
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, guess who?

55:56.867 --> 55:59.062
- Diana Vreeland?
- No.

55:59.103 --> 56:00.798
- John Lennon?
- No.

56:00.838 --> 56:02.396
Edie Sedgwick?

56:03.574 --> 56:05.542
No, I haven't seen her.

56:05.576 --> 56:07.510
Don't know where
she is.

56:07.544 --> 56:09.944
Hey, you wanna hear
my new idea for a movie?

56:12.216 --> 56:13.945
Think I can invite her
for dinner?

56:13.984 --> 56:16.714
- Who?
- Edie.

56:16.754 --> 56:18.551
You wanna introduce her
to your mother?

56:18.589 --> 56:21.057
Why?

56:21.091 --> 56:23.184
Well, I hadn't thought--
I don't know.

56:23.227 --> 56:24.717
Might be nice.

56:24.762 --> 56:27.458
Jeez, Andy, you must really miss her.

56:27.498 --> 56:29.796
You never invite
anybody else over.

56:29.833 --> 56:32.233
Oh, cut it out.
You can't be that mean.

56:32.269 --> 56:34.464
Well, you never
invited me over.

56:34.505 --> 56:36.939
You need to lose
25 lbs first.

56:36.974 --> 56:39.465
My mother's not gonna feed you.
She's nastier than you are.

56:39.510 --> 56:41.774
She is not!

56:51.522 --> 56:53.285
I draw too, like Andy.

56:53.323 --> 56:54.881
Oh, you do?

56:54.925 --> 56:58.224
My husband work in
coal mine back then, yeah?

56:58.262 --> 57:00.594
And he very very
good-looking.

57:00.631 --> 57:02.496
Beautiful white hair.

57:02.533 --> 57:05.696
Every girl want this boy,
but he want me.

57:05.736 --> 57:08.227
- But I no want.
- Well, why didn't you want him?

57:08.272 --> 57:09.603
- I 15.
- Oh.

57:09.640 --> 57:12.905
But then one day,
he bring chocolate...

57:14.945 --> 57:17.345
...for purposes to
marry him.

57:17.381 --> 57:20.976
So for this candy,
I marry him.

57:23.053 --> 57:24.315
Oh!

57:24.354 --> 57:27.881
You make my Andy
so very happy.

57:27.925 --> 57:29.119
Oh.

57:29.159 --> 57:31.354
Oh, my special boy.

57:32.529 --> 57:34.827
With you, I think,

57:34.865 --> 57:37.493
all his skin blotches
go away.

57:37.534 --> 57:39.297
Mama, dost.

57:39.336 --> 57:40.860
Let me help you
with that.

57:40.904 --> 57:43.168
You the boss,
applesauce.

57:44.975 --> 57:47.500
You know, Andy, I've been spending
a lot of time with Billy.

57:47.544 --> 57:49.409
And I think that the more
I think about it,

57:49.446 --> 57:50.777
I really think that
you should meet.

57:50.814 --> 57:52.338
You'd really like
each other.

57:52.382 --> 57:53.713
Why would he want
to meet me?

57:53.750 --> 57:55.775
Well, because
you're a genius.

57:55.819 --> 57:58.014
And he's a genius.
Well, isn't he a genius, Julia?

57:58.055 --> 57:59.647
Oh, my boy a genius.

57:59.690 --> 58:01.920
Can you imagine how--
I mean, if we made a movie or something,

58:01.959 --> 58:04.018
wouldn't that be fun,
how explosive that would be?

58:04.061 --> 58:05.790
I just think if we
took him to The Factory

58:05.829 --> 58:08.229
everybody would respond very well.
Plus, he'd look beautiful--

58:08.265 --> 58:10.699
Edie, I just wanted to
get that for you.

58:10.734 --> 58:12.929
I know it's only $50,

58:12.970 --> 58:15.370
but, well, I just
like the word "genius."

58:15.405 --> 58:17.339
I just think you should
say it over and over.

58:17.374 --> 58:19.706
Genius, genius,
genius, genius...

58:19.743 --> 58:22.041
Yeah, I dream
of genius.

58:24.281 --> 58:26.715
- Genius?
- Mmm-hmm.

58:26.750 --> 58:30.686
He used that word?
That sounds like your word.

58:30.721 --> 58:34.521
Well, genius,
brilliant, superstar--

58:34.558 --> 58:36.458
they're just words.

58:36.493 --> 58:39.360
What's important
is the sentiment.

58:39.396 --> 58:42.126
What's important
is the word.

58:43.133 --> 58:45.101
Well...

58:45.135 --> 58:48.935
you say you want to make a movie
with me, let's make a movie.

58:50.774 --> 58:52.366
Why?

58:52.409 --> 58:55.708
You want to make a movie
with me, I need to know why.

58:55.746 --> 58:58.909
Oh, babycakes.

58:58.949 --> 59:00.974
You're gonna hurt that
enormous brain of yours

59:01.018 --> 59:03.179
with all that thinking
you do.

59:12.930 --> 59:14.227
Ow.

59:20.904 --> 59:24.237
Oh, Andy,
don't be nervous.

59:33.550 --> 59:35.711
Oh he's here.
Chuck, get the camera ready. He's here.

59:35.752 --> 59:37.913
- Oh, hello.
- There she is, baby.

59:47.097 --> 59:49.065
You know Andy.

59:49.099 --> 59:51.158
- Hey.
- Say hello. This is Andy.

59:51.201 --> 59:54.500
Hi. Oh, wow,
you're such a beauty.

59:54.538 --> 59:57.132
Oh, here, would you
sign my book?

59:58.442 --> 1:00:00.637
Yeah, man.

1:00:04.815 --> 1:00:07.875
Oh, great.
Thank you.

1:00:07.918 --> 1:00:10.978
This is everybody.
This is The Factory.

1:00:11.021 --> 1:00:12.921
Should we start?
What do you think?

1:00:12.956 --> 1:00:14.583
Yeah, let's--

1:00:14.625 --> 1:00:17.458
I think we should
discuss salary

1:00:17.494 --> 1:00:19.894
in the beginning so there's
no misunderstanding.

1:00:19.930 --> 1:00:22.160
Oh, he never pays
the actors.

1:00:22.199 --> 1:00:24.133
You expect him
to work for free?

1:00:24.167 --> 1:00:27.603
Uh... um...

1:00:30.173 --> 1:00:33.165
- I could give him $11.
- $11?

1:00:33.210 --> 1:00:35.269
He's got $11.

1:00:35.312 --> 1:00:36.336
$11.

1:00:36.380 --> 1:00:38.905
Maybe we just take
11 of these instead.

1:00:38.949 --> 1:00:41.850
No, man.
Don't sweat it.

1:00:41.885 --> 1:00:45.514
I think my grandma's got 11 of these
stacked in her basement.

1:00:45.555 --> 1:00:47.887
You know?

1:00:47.924 --> 1:00:51.052
So...

1:00:51.094 --> 1:00:53.562
oh, you want
to make a movie?

1:00:53.597 --> 1:00:56.691
- Oh, yeah.
- Where do we start, Andy?

1:00:56.733 --> 1:00:58.792
Yeah, do you want to
just sit down here

1:00:58.835 --> 1:01:01.065
in front
of the camera?

1:01:06.576 --> 1:01:10.103
You know what, man?
Nah, I don't wanna sit.

1:01:10.147 --> 1:01:12.377
Can I just stand
in front of the chair?

1:01:12.416 --> 1:01:15.283
Oh, yeah. I mean, you know,
you can do whatever.

1:01:15.319 --> 1:01:16.980
It's your screen test.

1:01:19.289 --> 1:01:21.280
No, it's not.
It's yours.

1:01:23.660 --> 1:01:26.788
Come on, man,
direct me.

1:01:31.201 --> 1:01:33.533
Well, sit down.

1:01:47.984 --> 1:01:49.542
I'm sorry.

1:01:51.455 --> 1:01:54.686
You could just look
at the camera maybe.

1:01:55.759 --> 1:01:58.023
Yeah, I could do it.

1:01:58.061 --> 1:02:00.791
So this is
where you work?

1:02:00.831 --> 1:02:04.790
This is where you paint
your cans of beans

1:02:04.835 --> 1:02:07.497
- or whatever?
- Yeah.

1:02:07.537 --> 1:02:09.937
It's a big space, man.

1:02:09.973 --> 1:02:12.032
- Thanks.
- Right in the city.

1:02:12.075 --> 1:02:15.533
Must be real expensive.

1:02:17.381 --> 1:02:19.440
Oh, no.

1:02:19.483 --> 1:02:21.974
- No, it's not.
- Guy like you...

1:02:23.553 --> 1:02:26.181
must be really
generous, huh?

1:02:26.223 --> 1:02:28.521
- I mean...
- No.

1:02:28.558 --> 1:02:31.652
taking care
of all these people.

1:02:39.503 --> 1:02:42.939
Do you smoke, man,
or you just do that faggy speed shit?

1:02:42.973 --> 1:02:44.668
Just the "faggy
speed shit."

1:02:46.777 --> 1:02:49.678
Come on, man.

1:03:00.590 --> 1:03:03.889
No, man. Keep it. That's for you.

1:03:06.730 --> 1:03:08.755
- Here.
- Yeah.

1:03:12.702 --> 1:03:15.330
I think we got it.

1:03:15.372 --> 1:03:18.239
Well, great.

1:03:18.275 --> 1:03:20.470
Yeah, that was
so interesting. Thanks.

1:03:20.510 --> 1:03:22.910
- Don't you think, Chuck?
- Yeah.

1:03:22.946 --> 1:03:25.710
- Got everything you want?
- Oh, yeah. It was neat.

1:03:25.749 --> 1:03:27.512
- All right.
- Thanks.

1:03:27.551 --> 1:03:29.542
Let's split.

1:03:37.431 --> 1:03:39.558
What the hell was that?

1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:42.899
- You understand that he's my friend.
- He's your friend?

1:03:42.937 --> 1:03:45.303
He's my friend.

1:03:45.339 --> 1:03:47.967
Baby, your friend
is a bloodsucker, you know that?

1:03:48.009 --> 1:03:50.000
You're his prop.

1:03:50.044 --> 1:03:52.478
Okay?
You're disposable to him.

1:03:52.513 --> 1:03:55.141
Man, you should
fucking hate him.

1:03:55.183 --> 1:03:58.152
- He'll fucking kill you.
- I can't hate him!

1:03:59.654 --> 1:04:01.588
Come on, man.
Let me out.

1:04:01.622 --> 1:04:03.613
I'm not kidding, man.
Let me out.

1:04:05.927 --> 1:04:08.122
Edie, come on.
Come with me.

1:04:10.231 --> 1:04:13.564
You're so scared,
baby.

1:04:13.601 --> 1:04:16.297
You're so scared
of losing everything

1:04:16.337 --> 1:04:20.103
that doesn't
mean anything.

1:04:34.388 --> 1:04:36.481
Take care
of yourself, babe.

1:04:43.297 --> 1:04:45.629
It was the biggest mistake of my life.

1:04:51.038 --> 1:04:54.496
He was the first
and the last person

1:04:54.542 --> 1:04:56.601
that I ever loved
like that.

1:04:58.713 --> 1:05:00.977
And I know everyone says
that about their first,

1:05:01.015 --> 1:05:04.280
but when he and I
were together

1:05:04.318 --> 1:05:07.287
it felt perfect.

1:05:31.846 --> 1:05:33.905
Are you filming
right now?

1:05:33.948 --> 1:05:35.973
Oh.

1:05:36.017 --> 1:05:38.781
So this is the movies.

1:05:38.819 --> 1:05:41.344
- Andy. Andy, I saw the craziest thing.
- Shh!

1:05:41.389 --> 1:05:44.722
I always thought they'd be bigger.
Do you want me to talk?

1:05:44.759 --> 1:05:47.387
Ingrid, tell us another one
of your hilarious stories.

1:05:47.428 --> 1:05:48.918
You're going to be such a big star.

1:05:48.963 --> 1:05:51.158
Ingrid Superstar!

1:05:51.198 --> 1:05:53.257
You know, I've never done
nothing like this before.

1:05:53.301 --> 1:05:54.495
Just be like Edie.

1:05:54.535 --> 1:05:56.526
Except the part where
she takes too many drugs.

1:05:56.570 --> 1:05:58.800
Is there another part?

1:05:58.839 --> 1:06:00.807
Oh no, I don't do
the heavy stuff.

1:06:00.841 --> 1:06:02.968
I think Edie and Ingrid
look like sisters.

1:06:03.010 --> 1:06:04.978
Andy, she doesn't
look anything like me.

1:06:05.012 --> 1:06:07.480
"Andy, she doesn't
look anything like me."

1:06:07.515 --> 1:06:09.380
The resemblance
is uncanny.

1:06:09.417 --> 1:06:12.511
Tell me about the first
time a boy touched you.

1:06:12.553 --> 1:06:14.020
Oh yeah, Charlie Connell

1:06:14.055 --> 1:06:15.955
paid me a nickel to put
his hand up my dress.

1:06:15.990 --> 1:06:19.016
After that, it was so easy I charged
all his friends a dime.

1:06:19.060 --> 1:06:22.154
Seriously,
by the time I was 15,

1:06:22.196 --> 1:06:23.891
between me and my friend,
we had 68 bucks,

1:06:23.931 --> 1:06:25.796
which was enough for a bus ticket

1:06:25.833 --> 1:06:27.824
and cab fare and a hot meal
at Cafe Figaro,

1:06:27.868 --> 1:06:29.995
where you guys
picked me up.

1:06:30.037 --> 1:06:33.370
Miss Sedgwick, open up!

1:06:34.508 --> 1:06:36.499
Miss Sedgwick!

1:06:41.782 --> 1:06:43.977
Merry Christmas,
Mrs. Whitley.

1:06:44.018 --> 1:06:46.418
Christmas was last week,
Miss Sedgwick.

1:06:46.454 --> 1:06:48.445
So was December.

1:06:48.489 --> 1:06:50.821
November was the month
before that.

1:06:50.858 --> 1:06:53.884
And we all know
when October was.

1:06:55.229 --> 1:06:58.960
Happy New Year.
Your rent's three months late.

1:07:07.541 --> 1:07:09.532
Taxi!

1:07:13.214 --> 1:07:16.741
I need money, James.
I need it now.

1:07:16.784 --> 1:07:18.877
It's all spent,
Miss Sedgwick.

1:07:18.919 --> 1:07:20.887
I need to pay
for my apartment.

1:07:20.921 --> 1:07:23.412
Your father pays half your
rent every month, period.

1:07:23.457 --> 1:07:25.152
He calls it tough love.

1:07:25.192 --> 1:07:28.218
In my opinion, young lady,
he's been quite generous.

1:07:28.262 --> 1:07:31.595
You want to know what "tough love"
was for me, James?

1:07:33.134 --> 1:07:36.695
Trying to keep
my father

1:07:36.737 --> 1:07:39.638
out of my bed since
I was eight years old.

1:07:39.673 --> 1:07:43.165
My God.

1:07:43.210 --> 1:07:45.303
Does your
mother know?

1:07:45.346 --> 1:07:47.541
- Did you ever tell her?
- Yeah.

1:07:47.581 --> 1:07:50.607
What did she say?

1:07:50.651 --> 1:07:52.642
Nothing.

1:07:53.654 --> 1:07:55.281
Miss Sedg--

1:07:55.322 --> 1:07:59.224
Edie, I can help you.

1:08:01.095 --> 1:08:04.258
You can have
what I've got here.

1:08:04.298 --> 1:08:07.131
Oh, child, child.

1:08:07.168 --> 1:08:09.796
Child.

1:08:23.350 --> 1:08:26.046
Hello.

1:08:26.086 --> 1:08:28.418
Andy, it's Edie!

1:08:31.192 --> 1:08:33.490
He's not here.

1:08:35.930 --> 1:08:39.195
So, Silver,

1:08:39.233 --> 1:08:43.067
can-- can-- can
I borrow some money?

1:08:45.172 --> 1:08:47.902
Yeah.

1:08:47.942 --> 1:08:50.035
Let me have 50,
and I'll give you 10.

1:08:50.077 --> 1:08:53.535
I'm serious.

1:08:53.581 --> 1:08:56.015
You know, sweets,

1:08:56.050 --> 1:08:58.712
Andy's not the only
game in town.

1:08:58.752 --> 1:09:01.550
I have a friend Max.

1:09:01.589 --> 1:09:03.989
He's friends
with a friend

1:09:04.024 --> 1:09:06.686
who knows
Alfred Hitchcock.

1:09:13.467 --> 1:09:15.901
I think it could be good
for your career.

1:09:25.145 --> 1:09:27.010
I started to scheme

1:09:27.047 --> 1:09:29.811
about how
to get drugs.

1:09:29.850 --> 1:09:32.250
I shot heroin to come down
from speed

1:09:32.286 --> 1:09:36.052
and keep
the big sadness at bay.

1:09:38.626 --> 1:09:41.618
But I got completely
out of control.

1:10:12.660 --> 1:10:15.823
She really is like
a glamorous Viking, isn't she?

1:10:15.863 --> 1:10:18.627
An East Berlin original.

1:10:34.258 --> 1:10:37.421
Well, we're sponsoring
a new band.

1:10:37.461 --> 1:10:39.793
Oh, what are
they called?

1:10:39.830 --> 1:10:41.297
- The Velvet Underground.
- Oh, yeah.

1:10:41.332 --> 1:10:43.664
And since I don't believe
in painting any more,

1:10:43.701 --> 1:10:47.432
we thought it
would be a nice--

1:10:47.471 --> 1:10:50.998
A way of combining music,
films and art.

1:10:51.041 --> 1:10:52.531
Nico, how about a photo?

1:10:54.311 --> 1:10:57.007
Hello, Mum-mum.

1:10:57.047 --> 1:11:00.107
How are you, dear?

1:11:00.151 --> 1:11:03.052
Is-- is Fuzzy there?

1:11:03.087 --> 1:11:05.282
You're not going to ask
for money, are you, honey?

1:11:05.322 --> 1:11:06.789
No, no.

1:11:06.824 --> 1:11:10.191
I just wanted
to say hello.

1:11:10.227 --> 1:11:12.491
Oh, yes, of course.

1:11:12.530 --> 1:11:14.430
Let me get him.

1:11:14.465 --> 1:11:17.593
Fuzzy, darling,
it's Edith on the phone.

1:11:17.635 --> 1:11:19.398
You talk to her.

1:11:19.437 --> 1:11:22.565
- You've got to talk to her.
- Fuzzy.

1:11:22.606 --> 1:11:24.699
- It sounds like she's desperate.
- I hate the bitch.

1:11:24.742 --> 1:11:26.733
Talk to her. She's your daughter.

1:11:26.777 --> 1:11:28.836
Tell her to go make her movies.

1:11:28.879 --> 1:11:31.177
He'd love to talk,
darling, but he's tied up at the moment.

1:11:31.215 --> 1:11:33.183
- Take care, Mum-mum.
- He'll call you right back, okay?

1:12:26.170 --> 1:12:28.798
I'm just so tired.

1:12:31.242 --> 1:12:34.268
Andy Warhol superstar-
slash-socialite Edie Sedgwick

1:12:34.311 --> 1:12:36.677
was taken to Lenox Hospital
today after starting a fire.

1:12:36.714 --> 1:12:38.682
She almost burned down
the whole fucking place.

1:12:38.816 --> 1:12:41.979
She suffered first-degree
burns on her arms and legs.

1:12:42.019 --> 1:12:44.010
What do you want me
to do?

1:12:46.524 --> 1:12:50.426
I don't know.
See if she needs anything.

1:12:53.364 --> 1:12:55.355
I'd help her
if I could.

1:13:24.204 --> 1:13:27.401
Richie, honey,

1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:29.931
I need to ask
you a favor.

1:13:29.976 --> 1:13:33.742
Richie, darling! It's been ages.
How's your father?

1:13:33.780 --> 1:13:36.442
He just bought my mother
a 10-carat stone.

1:13:36.483 --> 1:13:39.213
If anyone else, you'd think he was
screwing the Rockettes.

1:13:41.321 --> 1:13:44.017
Diana, I'm calling
about Edie Sedgwick.

1:13:44.057 --> 1:13:45.285
Yes.

1:13:45.325 --> 1:13:47.520
She's been trying
to reach you.

1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:49.551
I have her here.
I'm going to put her on.

1:13:54.100 --> 1:13:56.762
- Hello.
- Edie.

1:13:56.803 --> 1:13:59.567
Divine one,
how are you?

1:13:59.606 --> 1:14:02.541
Your pictures
were incredible.

1:14:03.977 --> 1:14:06.605
I'm afraid we can't sign
you right now, darling.

1:14:06.646 --> 1:14:09.444
Why not?

1:14:09.482 --> 1:14:11.450
The board feels--

1:14:11.484 --> 1:14:13.384
they feel...

1:14:13.420 --> 1:14:16.287
Andy Warhol's
mise-en-scène,

1:14:16.322 --> 1:14:18.552
it's become too seedy.

1:14:18.591 --> 1:14:21.458
The drugs, darling,
the riffraff.

1:14:21.494 --> 1:14:24.952
The patina is damaged.
They think you've become vulgar.

1:14:26.566 --> 1:14:29.933
Vulgar? How?

1:14:29.969 --> 1:14:33.234
I don't know, but it's
better than being boring.

1:14:33.273 --> 1:14:36.970
Now do take care
of yourself.

1:14:44.017 --> 1:14:47.111
You what?

1:14:49.222 --> 1:14:51.850
I hope you're happy.

1:14:55.028 --> 1:14:58.191
Everyone in New York
is laughing at me.

1:15:00.433 --> 1:15:02.526
I can't leave
my apartment.

1:15:02.569 --> 1:15:04.560
I can't get a job.

1:15:04.604 --> 1:15:07.164
Your movies have made
a fool out of me.

1:15:07.207 --> 1:15:09.072
Oh, no. They've made
you famous, Edie,

1:15:09.108 --> 1:15:11.668
and that's what
you wanted.

1:15:11.711 --> 1:15:13.838
No one will have
anything to do with me

1:15:13.880 --> 1:15:16.212
because of you.

1:15:16.249 --> 1:15:18.911
But every teenage girl from Jersey
wants to look like you, Edie.

1:15:18.952 --> 1:15:22.012
Andy, I have nothing.

1:15:22.055 --> 1:15:25.320
You owe me that money.
I need that money.

1:15:25.358 --> 1:15:28.987
But I gave you $50. I gave you money.
Did you spend it already?

1:15:29.028 --> 1:15:31.326
50 fucking dollars?

1:15:31.364 --> 1:15:32.797
I'm sure if you wait a year or two,

1:15:32.832 --> 1:15:34.197
someone from Hollywood
will put you in a movie

1:15:34.234 --> 1:15:36.964
with Tony Perkins. And then you can earn
all the money you want

1:15:37.003 --> 1:15:38.334
and spend all that too.

1:15:38.371 --> 1:15:40.498
You think that I'll
go to Hollywood?

1:15:40.540 --> 1:15:44.169
You think I can't function without you?
I'll be fucking fine.

1:15:44.210 --> 1:15:46.041
Are you going to live there

1:15:46.079 --> 1:15:48.639
with your boyfriend
and his wife?

1:15:54.821 --> 1:15:56.584
What?

1:16:05.465 --> 1:16:08.457
You filthy,
filthy, fucking--

1:16:08.501 --> 1:16:10.366
Edie, enough!

1:16:10.403 --> 1:16:13.497
- You fucked me up!
- That's enough!

1:16:13.540 --> 1:16:16.407
And your Factory!

1:16:16.442 --> 1:16:19.275
You fucked me up
and you know it!

1:16:19.312 --> 1:16:21.007
You look at me.

1:16:21.047 --> 1:16:23.345
Look at me!

1:16:43.979 --> 1:16:46.038
Andy...

1:16:47.682 --> 1:16:50.242
who is this you
are talking about?

1:16:53.255 --> 1:16:55.815
I don't know what to say
to her anymore.

1:16:57.492 --> 1:16:59.517
And I don't know
what I did.

1:17:00.662 --> 1:17:03.222
She's such
a beautiful girl,

1:17:03.265 --> 1:17:04.994
but it's like she just
wants to be ugly now.

1:17:05.033 --> 1:17:08.002
And I don't understand

1:17:08.036 --> 1:17:10.596
why anybody
would want that.

1:17:14.309 --> 1:17:16.777
How do you stop somebody
from not doing something

1:17:16.811 --> 1:17:19.541
if they don't want to?

1:17:19.581 --> 1:17:21.572
We will say a prayer
for her

1:17:21.616 --> 1:17:23.709
and then we will
go and light a candle.

1:17:23.752 --> 1:17:27.620
I never met anybody
like her before.

1:17:48.476 --> 1:17:50.603
Who is he?

1:17:50.645 --> 1:17:53.478
Don't you remember?

1:17:53.515 --> 1:17:56.348
This is my friend, Max.

1:17:56.384 --> 1:18:00.218
The guy who knows the guy
who knows Alfred Hitchcock.

1:18:00.255 --> 1:18:03.315
Oh, right.

1:18:04.726 --> 1:18:06.751
Is your--
is your friend

1:18:06.795 --> 1:18:09.457
stealing my silverware?

1:18:09.497 --> 1:18:12.432
No, he's just
borrowing it.

1:18:12.467 --> 1:18:13.798
Is that okay?

1:18:13.835 --> 1:18:17.464
Just because I let
your friend

1:18:17.505 --> 1:18:19.029
fuck me last night

1:18:19.074 --> 1:18:22.874
doesn't mean that he
can take my silver.

1:18:22.911 --> 1:18:25.471
Did he film it?

1:18:25.513 --> 1:18:29.142
Yes, and you were great.

1:18:33.822 --> 1:18:37.815
- Are you done?
- Yeah, that's a wrap.

1:18:39.961 --> 1:18:42.259
- How do I look?
- You look groovy.

1:18:42.297 --> 1:18:44.595
Hey, Edie,

1:18:44.632 --> 1:18:46.463
can he borrow
your coat?

1:18:46.501 --> 1:18:49.493
That looks really
good on you.

1:18:49.537 --> 1:18:50.868
Thanks.

1:18:52.273 --> 1:18:54.798
All right, sweets,
I gotta go.

1:18:54.843 --> 1:18:56.310
Don't-- don't go.

1:18:56.344 --> 1:18:59.472
Don't leave me now.

1:18:59.514 --> 1:19:02.312
Maybe I'll come back later.

1:19:02.350 --> 1:19:05.478
Don't forget to blow out
all these candles.

1:19:07.155 --> 1:19:08.952
God, maybe you should
just sort of--

1:19:12.660 --> 1:19:15.060
Ciao.

1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:21.663
- Take off her coat, man.
- She said I could borrow it.

1:19:21.703 --> 1:19:24.695
No no no. Either you take it off
or I'm gonna take it off for you.

1:19:24.739 --> 1:19:27.606
- It's your choice.
- She just said that he could borrow--

1:19:27.642 --> 1:19:30.167
Take off the fucking coat!

1:19:30.211 --> 1:19:32.372
Hey, man,

1:19:32.414 --> 1:19:34.712
just mellow out, man.

1:19:34.749 --> 1:19:36.478
Now get the fuck
out of here.

1:19:36.518 --> 1:19:39.316
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Okay.

1:19:39.354 --> 1:19:42.551
We were just leaving,
man.

1:19:44.335 --> 1:19:47.634
Syd, is that you?

1:19:54.611 --> 1:19:56.442
Let me see.

1:19:58.182 --> 1:19:59.740
What are you doing?

1:19:59.783 --> 1:20:03.446
I said it all to him.

1:20:03.487 --> 1:20:04.715
I told him.

1:20:08.625 --> 1:20:10.252
I-I said it to Andy.

1:20:10.294 --> 1:20:14.253
I said it all to him.
Is that why you're here?

1:20:14.298 --> 1:20:18.064
Are we going upstate like he said?
'Cause if we are,

1:20:18.102 --> 1:20:20.866
I just need to put
a few things into a bag.

1:20:20.904 --> 1:20:22.565
He's out of town,
all right?

1:20:22.606 --> 1:20:24.801
But maybe,
maybe when he gets back.

1:20:24.842 --> 1:20:26.707
All right?

1:20:28.045 --> 1:20:31.674
Did-- did my father
call you?

1:20:31.715 --> 1:20:33.114
Is that why--

1:20:33.150 --> 1:20:35.710
is he gonna lock me
up again?

1:20:35.753 --> 1:20:37.050
No.

1:20:37.087 --> 1:20:40.181
Syd, will you stay--

1:20:40.224 --> 1:20:43.352
- stay the night with me?
- No.

1:20:43.394 --> 1:20:45.385
Edie.

1:20:47.297 --> 1:20:49.492
Lately, I--

1:20:52.102 --> 1:20:55.128
I feel like
I'm gonna die.

1:20:55.172 --> 1:20:56.901
You're not
gonna die, Edie.

1:20:59.143 --> 1:21:02.442
You're gonna be fine.
I promise.

1:21:02.479 --> 1:21:05.175
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:21:08.152 --> 1:21:11.747
Hey, how about I buy
you something to eat?

1:21:11.789 --> 1:21:14.553
Can I do that?

1:21:18.562 --> 1:21:21.929
Looks like an accident.
It may be a while.

1:21:23.167 --> 1:21:25.431
Where are we going, Syd?

1:21:27.204 --> 1:21:29.798
I want to show
you something.

1:21:34.044 --> 1:21:37.036
Do you remember
that girl?

1:21:37.081 --> 1:21:38.639
Huh?

1:21:41.251 --> 1:21:43.048
That's--

1:21:43.087 --> 1:21:45.453
what was I thinking?

1:21:45.489 --> 1:21:49.016
The only reason I ever
went to that class was because of you.

1:21:50.394 --> 1:21:52.089
It's true.

1:21:54.498 --> 1:21:57.058
Do you remember her?

1:22:07.344 --> 1:22:09.335
No.

1:22:17.721 --> 1:22:19.348
Edie!

1:22:27.798 --> 1:22:31.734
I'm not saying that
anyone else is responsible.

1:22:31.768 --> 1:22:33.360
I made decisions,

1:22:33.403 --> 1:22:35.394
life decisions
that I regret.

1:22:37.608 --> 1:22:41.009
But I really feel
like I can do this.

1:22:42.379 --> 1:22:44.006
I can stay
off the drugs,

1:22:44.047 --> 1:22:46.174
and I realize that it will
be a battle every day,

1:22:46.216 --> 1:22:49.344
but so far

1:22:49.386 --> 1:22:51.445
so good, right?

1:22:53.123 --> 1:22:54.886
But I'm home.

1:22:54.925 --> 1:22:58.122
Santa Barbara
is my home.

1:23:00.764 --> 1:23:03.562
And I have a small show.
Did I tell you that?

1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:05.363
I mean,
it's nothing major.

1:23:05.402 --> 1:23:09.395
It's just in a frame shop,
but it's something.

1:23:52.416 --> 1:23:55.977
I just think people forgot what emotions
were supposed to be.

1:23:56.019 --> 1:23:58.146
I mean,
it's too hard to care.

1:23:58.188 --> 1:24:00.850
I mean, you know,
I still care,

1:24:00.891 --> 1:24:04.019
but it would just be so
much nicer not to care.

1:24:04.061 --> 1:24:06.621
It's just easier
being detached.

1:24:06.663 --> 1:24:08.756
What about Edie?

1:24:08.799 --> 1:24:11.461
Oh, what about Edie?
I haven't seen her in years.

1:24:11.501 --> 1:24:13.526
You know she died
yesterday?

1:24:13.570 --> 1:24:15.561
Oh, yeah.

1:24:15.606 --> 1:24:19.474
Do you think your breakup had something
to do with that detachment?

1:24:19.509 --> 1:24:21.477
Well, it wasn't
a breakup.

1:24:21.511 --> 1:24:25.242
I mean, that makes
it sound like we were--

1:24:25.282 --> 1:24:28.445
I mean, this is gonna
be really hard if we have to-- if--

1:24:32.022 --> 1:24:34.013
You know, it was
just so long ago.

1:24:34.057 --> 1:24:37.151
I mean, I hardly
knew her at all, so...

1:24:46.903 --> 1:24:49.838
I wonder if people
are gonna remember us.

1:24:49.873 --> 1:24:52.341
- What, when we're dead?
- Yeah.

1:24:52.376 --> 1:24:55.675
I think people will talk about how
you changed the world.

1:24:55.712 --> 1:24:58.510
I wonder what they'll say about you

1:24:58.548 --> 1:25:00.482
in your obituary.

1:25:00.517 --> 1:25:02.781
- I like that word.
- Nothing nice, I don't think.

1:25:02.819 --> 1:25:05.117
Oh, no, come on. It'd say,

1:25:05.155 --> 1:25:07.385
"Edith Minturn Sedgwick,

1:25:07.424 --> 1:25:09.392
beautiful artist
and actress..."

1:25:09.426 --> 1:25:11.394
"And all-around loon."

1:25:11.428 --> 1:25:13.658
"Remembered for setting
the world on fire..."

1:25:13.697 --> 1:25:16.860
"And escaping the clutches
of her terrifying family."

1:25:16.900 --> 1:25:19.494
"Made friends
with everybody and anybody..."

1:25:19.536 --> 1:25:22.505
"Creating chaos
and uproar wherever she went.

1:25:22.539 --> 1:25:24.837
Divorced as many times
as she married,

1:25:24.875 --> 1:25:27.639
she leaves only
good wishes behind."

1:25:29.212 --> 1:25:31.578
That's nice, isn't it?

1:25:44.027 --> 1:25:46.518
Edie seemed
to understand from the beginning

1:25:46.563 --> 1:25:48.292
her life
was going to be short.

1:25:48.332 --> 1:25:49.731
She was a blip on
the radar suddenly.

1:25:49.766 --> 1:25:51.495
It just blew out everybody.

1:25:51.535 --> 1:25:53.901
You walk into a room
and Edie was there.

1:25:53.937 --> 1:25:55.598
Edie was what you saw.

1:25:55.639 --> 1:25:59.439
There was something
so vulnerable about Edie.

1:25:59.476 --> 1:26:03.310
She was a person
that everybody adored

1:26:03.347 --> 1:26:04.939
and kind of worshipped,

1:26:04.981 --> 1:26:07.814
but you knew that she was
basically fragile.

1:26:07.851 --> 1:26:09.512
Time sort of stopped
when you were with her.

1:26:09.553 --> 1:26:11.748
She was
an exquisite creature.

1:26:11.788 --> 1:26:14.518
She had sort of a gamine look.
Very long legs,

1:26:14.558 --> 1:26:17.527
very pale face,
very pale lips.

1:26:17.561 --> 1:26:19.290
And a waif, in a way.

1:26:19.329 --> 1:26:22.457
And I think probably
the weakness of her showed there.

1:26:22.499 --> 1:26:24.933
Andy was very struck by her.

1:26:24.968 --> 1:26:27.095
Andy would always
invite somebody, to say,

1:26:27.137 --> 1:26:29.105
"Would you want to be
in one of my movies?"

1:26:29.139 --> 1:26:31.903
And of course, Edie took Andy
very seriously on that.

1:26:31.942 --> 1:26:35.400
Who was Edie Sedgwick?
Edie Sedgwick was a combination

1:26:35.445 --> 1:26:38.414
of all the tragic women
who came before her.

1:26:38.448 --> 1:26:41.645
She looked great
in front of a camera.

1:26:41.685 --> 1:26:43.778
And she loved being
in front of one.

1:26:43.820 --> 1:26:46.311
Edie was taken advantage of,

1:26:46.356 --> 1:26:49.553
and hugely because she
was so loving and trusting.

1:26:49.593 --> 1:26:51.060
She was very trusting.

1:26:51.094 --> 1:26:53.358
She looked into your eyes.

1:26:53.397 --> 1:26:55.558
She listened to what
you had to say.

1:26:55.599 --> 1:26:58.568
She made you believe that you were
the most important person

1:26:58.602 --> 1:27:00.729
to her
or on the planet.

1:27:00.771 --> 1:27:03.399
Yeah, I think Edie took on Andy

1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:05.965
as the father
that she didn't have.

1:27:06.009 --> 1:27:08.569
Everybody I know that really
knew her wanted to save her.

1:27:08.612 --> 1:27:11.843
That was one of the things--
trying to keep her off drugs,

1:27:11.882 --> 1:27:14.783
trying to get her
to pull her life together.

1:27:14.818 --> 1:27:18.151
If you said "I love you,"
she just brightened up.

1:27:18.188 --> 1:27:20.452
So you got
an immediate response,

1:27:20.490 --> 1:27:23.254
and I think that's
how she caught people really strongly.

1:27:23.293 --> 1:27:26.285
She had her own sense
of style,

1:27:26.329 --> 1:27:28.297
which no one
had ever seen before.

1:27:28.331 --> 1:27:30.492
She invented
an entirely new look.

1:27:30.534 --> 1:27:33.628
She inspired us all to want
to take care of her.

1:27:33.670 --> 1:27:36.366
But believe me,
that was some job.

1:27:36.406 --> 1:27:38.499
And of course, she had
a terrible time with drugs

1:27:38.542 --> 1:27:41.568
and also the character
that comes with that.

1:27:41.611 --> 1:27:44.842
Endless searching
through her bag to try to find a key

1:27:44.881 --> 1:27:48.078
or to try to find lipstick
or whatever.

1:27:48.118 --> 1:27:50.052
But still
enchanting anyway.
