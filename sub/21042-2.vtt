WEBVTT

00:08.008 --> 00:09.710
NARRATOR: Imagine a world

00:09.743 --> 00:12.080
where your 300th birthday
looks more like your 30th.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.048
Sounds good, right?

00:14.082 --> 00:18.086
EVA: Oscar, I'm done.
Do you need the VR?

00:18.119 --> 00:20.321
GROUP: Surprise!

00:20.354 --> 00:21.555
NARRATOR: Well in the future

00:21.589 --> 00:23.224
radical life extension
technology

00:23.257 --> 00:25.159
will make our current life span

00:25.193 --> 00:27.328
seem like a mere
blink of an eye.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.697
OSCAR: Happy birthday.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.166
NARRATOR: We'll stay healthy
and active for centuries,

00:32.200 --> 00:34.034
putting plastic surgeons
out of a job.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.736
[clinks glass]

00:35.769 --> 00:40.341
OSCAR: So, it's not every day
your wife turns 300.

00:40.374 --> 00:46.080
So, to Eva, who is as beautiful
as the day I met her.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.615
NARRATOR: Adding centuries
to your life

00:47.648 --> 00:50.618
will radically redefine
how we view relationships,

00:50.651 --> 00:56.724
work, childbirth, and
the fabric of society itself.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.593
And those who choose immortality
will have to rethink

00:59.627 --> 01:04.465
the very idea of what it means
to be alive at all.

01:04.498 --> 01:12.373
*

01:12.406 --> 01:15.309
It's the deep future.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.645
Your body? Gone.

01:17.678 --> 01:21.482
You're all computer,
all the time.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.751
Your brain is way more powerful

01:23.784 --> 01:27.388
than even a billion
supercomputers.

01:27.421 --> 01:32.560
Jobs, food, language, water,
even traditional thought,

01:32.593 --> 01:35.095
all of humanity's
building blocks?

01:35.129 --> 01:37.064
All that's done.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.000
And you are immortal.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.735
Squirming in your chair yet?

01:41.769 --> 01:42.936
You should be.

01:42.970 --> 01:45.072
This isn't science fiction.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.642
Today's visionary thinkers say
it's a strong probability

01:48.676 --> 01:52.012
that this is what your world
is going to look like.

01:52.045 --> 01:55.316
Tonight, they'll guide you
toward that spectacular future,

01:55.349 --> 01:58.085
and we'll see how
one family navigates it,

01:58.118 --> 02:00.321
one invention at a time.

02:00.354 --> 02:03.357
This is the story
of your future.

02:03.391 --> 02:07.027
This is the road
to Year Million.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.002
Just so we're clear,

02:15.035 --> 02:18.138
the Year Million is not
literally the year one million.

02:18.172 --> 02:21.642
It's another way of saying
the far, far future.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.943
CHUCK NICE: The Year Million,

02:22.976 --> 02:25.679
it's really not
one million years.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.716
It is a concept of an age.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.984
So think about this:
the Earth is about, what?

02:31.018 --> 02:34.655
4.5 billion years old.

02:34.688 --> 02:40.328
So the Year Million
is a literal...

02:40.361 --> 02:42.496
NARRATOR: That's right.
A blink of an eye.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.132
And human life has been around
for less than that.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.401
But it hasn't stopped us
from obsessing

02:47.435 --> 02:49.136
about how we can extend it,

02:49.169 --> 02:52.640
since, well,
since the beginning of time.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.008
BRIAN GREENE: The nature
of human mortality

02:55.042 --> 03:00.147
is one of the most poignant
parts of existence.

03:00.180 --> 03:06.153
We're born, and we know
we're going to die.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.522
Great thinkers,
from Einstein to Freud,

03:08.556 --> 03:12.059
have long since
come to the conclusion

03:12.092 --> 03:15.095
that the fact that we are born
with the knowledge

03:15.128 --> 03:21.935
that we are going to die
is what shapes how we live.

03:21.969 --> 03:25.439
If that changes, then I think
we'd fundamentally change

03:25.473 --> 03:29.042
what it means to be human.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.744
NARRATOR: Thank you, Brian.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.413
Folks, let's be clear,

03:32.446 --> 03:35.516
it's no longer a question of if,
but rather when,

03:35.549 --> 03:40.020
we as a species will have
the choice to become immortal.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.622
So for those of you
who've played your part

03:41.655 --> 03:44.258
in the billion-dollar spend
on anti-aging creams,

03:44.292 --> 03:46.059
diets and gym memberships,

03:46.093 --> 03:49.430
hoping you can turn back
the clock and extend your lives,

03:49.463 --> 03:52.199
get excited,
because the real revolution

03:52.232 --> 03:55.536
in radical life extension
has already begun.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.372
And it's way beyond just
skin-deep solutions.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.908
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

04:00.941 --> 04:05.879
*

04:05.913 --> 04:07.415
The first stage
towards immortality

04:07.448 --> 04:10.984
lies in the advancement
of nanotechnology.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.219
In the near future,

04:12.252 --> 04:14.655
we'll send tiny
microscopic robots

04:14.688 --> 04:16.424
coursing through
our bloodstreams,

04:16.457 --> 04:18.626
fixing mutations in our cells,

04:18.659 --> 04:22.996
so that they never get old
or fall apart.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.999
Next, we'll not only
re-engineer our DNA

04:26.033 --> 04:29.403
to resist all life-threatening
diseases and viruses,

04:29.437 --> 04:32.506
we'll be able to create
super-intelligent children,

04:32.540 --> 04:36.444
designed to our exact
specifications.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.179
Now it's time to get weird.

04:39.212 --> 04:42.316
If creating the ultimate
sustainable biological body

04:42.350 --> 04:43.984
isn't enough,

04:44.017 --> 04:47.655
there may be a time when
our descendants will choose

04:47.688 --> 04:52.793
to discard
their physical bodies,

04:52.826 --> 04:57.498
and upload themselves
into a digital world.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.833
And for those of you who might
not live long enough

04:59.867 --> 05:02.102
to see the beginnings
of these breakthroughs,

05:02.135 --> 05:03.971
you can make a long-shot bet
on the future

05:04.004 --> 05:08.175
in the form of
cryonic preservation.

05:08.208 --> 05:11.278
Freezing yourselves until
the day we wake up to a world

05:11.311 --> 05:16.149
where technology has caught up
with our dream for eternal life.

05:16.183 --> 05:19.319
Our journey to immortality will
transform the way we live,

05:19.353 --> 05:23.857
the relationships we have, and
the very meaning of life itself.

05:30.063 --> 05:33.534
But let's rewind
to a more recent future.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.002
Remember that birthday party?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.538
It's just getting started.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.040
But what's the perfect gift
for the person you love,

05:40.073 --> 05:43.076
when she turns 300?

05:43.110 --> 05:46.580
Something more precious
than diamonds or gold.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.219
EVA: You know what I want
for my birthday, don't you?

05:52.252 --> 05:55.589
OSCAR: What's that?

05:55.623 --> 06:01.429
EVA: The only thing that I want

06:01.462 --> 06:02.930
is more time with you.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.832
NARRATOR: Time,
it's what everyone wants

06:04.865 --> 06:06.434
but never has enough of.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.836
So how do these two lovebirds
get a marriage

06:08.869 --> 06:12.005
that lasts 200 years,
let alone survive it?

06:12.039 --> 06:15.909
The answer might be found in
the most unsuspecting of places.

06:20.548 --> 06:23.784
Yes, whales.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.558
MICHIO KAKU:
The bowhead whale lives,

06:30.591 --> 06:34.127
we think, on the order
of 200 years.

06:34.161 --> 06:37.030
NARRATOR: In 2007,
a giant bowhead whale

06:37.064 --> 06:39.767
was caught off
the coast of Alaska

06:39.800 --> 06:42.736
with a harpoon point
embedded in its neck.

06:42.770 --> 06:46.974
That harpoon was dated back
to approximately 1880,

06:47.007 --> 06:51.011
making that whale
around 130 years old.

06:53.481 --> 06:56.917
The Greenland shark can live
up to 400 years.

06:56.950 --> 07:00.654
What are they doing
that we're not?

07:00.688 --> 07:03.056
KAKU: Organisms age
at different rates.

07:03.090 --> 07:07.127
Some so long that we don't even
know what their life span is.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.329
Like crocodiles and alligators.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.998
I've visited
many crocodile farms,

07:11.031 --> 07:13.400
and I've talked to
the trainers there,

07:13.433 --> 07:14.968
and they all say the same thing,

07:15.002 --> 07:18.271
that, yeah, crocodiles
that are older than them,

07:18.305 --> 07:23.644
they're just as vigorous and
as energetic as youngsters.

07:27.515 --> 07:30.818
Aging is not necessarily a given

07:30.851 --> 07:34.655
for all organisms
on the planet Earth.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.089
NARRATOR: We don't know
exactly why some animals

07:36.123 --> 07:37.825
live longer than humans,

07:37.858 --> 07:41.161
but one theory is that our
biological clock is determined

07:41.194 --> 07:44.431
by parts of our cells
called telomeres.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.134
As we get older,
our telomeres fray,

07:47.167 --> 07:51.171
they stop dividing and decay,
and that's what causes aging.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.674
So what if we could somehow
stop the fraying,

07:53.707 --> 07:55.709
or reverse the cycle?

07:55.743 --> 07:57.477
PETER DIAMANDIS:
In medical school,

07:57.511 --> 08:02.816
I became enamored with the idea
that there are species on Earth

08:02.850 --> 08:06.787
that live for hundreds of years.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.157
If they can, why can't we?

08:10.190 --> 08:12.359
NARRATOR: Enter nanotechnology.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.998
Scientists are already
hard at work

08:18.031 --> 08:22.670
developing microscopic medical
devices known as nanobots.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.205
In the deep future, these
tiny robots will be injected

08:25.238 --> 08:28.542
directly into our bloodstreams.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.979
And they'll be able to repair
our cells from the inside.

08:32.012 --> 08:37.150
They'll be able to reverse
the telomere cycle from fraying.

08:37.184 --> 08:40.520
Nanobots will eventually be
so effective at curing disease,

08:40.554 --> 08:42.556
and even genetic mutations,

08:42.590 --> 08:45.859
that we'll never get sick,
and we'll never get old.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.762
EVA: Wow.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.163
DIAMANDIS: Imagine little robots

08:50.197 --> 08:53.033
that are able to go
into your cells,

08:53.066 --> 08:57.838
look for problems,
and actually correct them.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.774
THOMAS WEBSTER: We really
believe that nanotechnology

09:00.808 --> 09:03.510
might be the future for treating
a lot of our ailments

09:03.543 --> 09:07.380
that we've been unable to treat
using conventional therapies.

09:07.414 --> 09:10.884
DIAMANDIS: Those tools is
something that is in our future.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.020
It's just a matter of when,
not if.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.888
FARSAD: As it is right now,

09:14.922 --> 09:17.457
you can get your Botox
and your butt lift

09:17.490 --> 09:19.092
and just look like Gisele

09:19.126 --> 09:20.794
even though you started out,

09:20.828 --> 09:26.033
you know, looking like
a some sort of a frog.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.769
NARRATOR: Forget facelifts
and knee replacements.

09:28.802 --> 09:32.740
In the far future, nanobots will
be able to heal a gunshot wound,

09:32.773 --> 09:36.243
or treat the very first cell
of a lethal infection.

09:36.276 --> 09:40.313
And even as we speak, scientists
are using nanotechnology

09:40.347 --> 09:45.118
to help treat disease more
effectively than ever before.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.821
Now, I know what you're
thinking, but let's be clear--

09:47.855 --> 09:51.792
when we say nanobots, we're not
talking about little C-3POs.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.160
They'll be made
of something organic,

09:53.193 --> 09:55.395
so the body won't reject them.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.097
And a precursor
to these future bots

09:57.130 --> 09:58.966
is already being developed.

09:58.999 --> 10:02.169
It's a kind of messenger cell
that delivers life-saving drugs

10:02.202 --> 10:04.337
directly to the cells
that need it.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.973
The first step is just getting

10:06.006 --> 10:09.076
particles of medicine
that small.

10:09.109 --> 10:13.914
*

10:13.947 --> 10:15.949
WEBSTER: What we can see here
is a reaction

10:15.983 --> 10:17.951
that we've created in the lab

10:17.985 --> 10:22.155
that can make
nanoparticles of selenium.

10:22.189 --> 10:25.592
NARRATOR: In larger amounts,
the mineral selenium is toxic.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.862
But at the nano scale,
selenium can treat cancer.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.598
Scientists inject these
tiny amounts of selenium

10:31.631 --> 10:33.934
into special synthetic
immune cells,

10:33.967 --> 10:35.602
that are capable
of delivering it

10:35.635 --> 10:38.839
to the precise place in the body
that needs it.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.012
WEBSTER: So if there's
a mutation in a cell

10:45.045 --> 10:46.513
that might be cancerous,

10:46.546 --> 10:50.150
we deliver selenium
to that cell to kill it.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.152
You can use this as a mechanism

10:52.185 --> 10:58.125
to selectively kill
unwanted cells in your body.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.526
GEORGE CHURCH: There's no
fundamental law of physics

10:59.559 --> 11:01.829
that says that our bodies
have to decay

11:01.862 --> 11:03.496
if we're constantly
repairing them.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.798
DIAMANDIS:
When you have nanobots

11:04.832 --> 11:06.666
coursing through your blood,

11:06.700 --> 11:08.068
continuously repairing
everything

11:08.101 --> 11:10.170
back to its original condition,

11:10.203 --> 11:13.173
ultimately, that's the end point
of medicine.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.975
NARRATOR:
The end point of medicine.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.844
That is huge.

11:16.877 --> 11:20.180
It'll be a transformative day
in the history of humanity.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.915
BARATUNDE THURSTON:
I see advertisements

11:21.949 --> 11:24.251
promising a glorious,
extended future,

11:24.284 --> 11:26.519
10-year vacations
being marketed,

11:26.553 --> 11:31.158
and new properties, and what
to do with this extra time.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.993
NARRATOR: But nanotech
is just a Band-Aid.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.661
It's step one.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.264
If we're going to crack the code
to immortality,

11:37.297 --> 11:40.000
we're going to have to go deeper
into our own code,

11:40.033 --> 11:41.601
our genetic code,

11:41.634 --> 11:44.905
and alter the very
building blocks of human life.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.706
FARSAD: In the future,

11:46.740 --> 11:49.409
we're going to be able to get
rid of a lot of pesky genes,

11:49.442 --> 11:53.113
like the genes that give you
horrible diseases

11:53.146 --> 11:54.514
like Alzheimer's,

11:54.547 --> 11:57.217
but also the gene
that makes you,

11:57.250 --> 11:58.618
like, be one of those people

11:58.651 --> 12:00.687
that give weak handshakes,
you know?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.722
That's a terrible gene.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.858
NARRATOR:
That is a terrible gene!

12:04.892 --> 12:06.693
And if you had the option,
you definitely wouldn't

12:06.726 --> 12:09.696
want to pass it on
to your children, right?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.099
And that will one day
be an option.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.134
The first stage will be
treating unwanted genes,

12:14.167 --> 12:16.036
once they've expressed
themselves.

12:16.069 --> 12:20.073
Ultimately, we'll go into the
DNA of embryos and select genes

12:20.107 --> 12:23.443
before a child is even born.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.978
DIAMANDIS: I have two boys,

12:25.012 --> 12:29.549
and as my wife and I think
about their upbringing,

12:29.582 --> 12:31.985
we want them to have the best
education, the best clothing,

12:32.019 --> 12:34.587
the best healthcare,
the best of everything.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.056
But why wouldn't you
want to start

12:36.089 --> 12:38.625
with the best genetic material?

12:38.658 --> 12:42.462
We're going to go from having
a family by random chance,

12:42.495 --> 12:46.499
like, you have sex and
randomly rearrange the genes,

12:46.533 --> 12:48.802
to a point where it's like,
I would never, ever do that.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.603
I wouldn't leave that
to randomness.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.305
That's, that's immoral
to leave it to randomness.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.842
I'm going to select the best
genes I can for my child,

12:54.875 --> 12:58.245
give him the best start
from day one.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.113
NARRATOR: Say goodbye
to evolution

13:00.147 --> 13:02.950
and say hello
to genetic engineering.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.184
But is humanity able to cope

13:04.217 --> 13:06.753
with this kind
of responsibility?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.621
We'll be making
stronger, faster,

13:08.655 --> 13:10.457
more intelligent
versions of ourselves.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.025
It may sound awesome,

13:12.059 --> 13:15.028
but playing God has rarely
gone well in the past.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.496
If we're not careful,

13:16.529 --> 13:19.833
in the process of making
the ideal human being,

13:19.867 --> 13:22.035
we may just destroy
our own humanity forever.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.875
NARRATOR:
Welcome back to the future,

13:27.908 --> 13:30.610
where nanotechnology has
brought us one step further

13:30.643 --> 13:32.846
in the quest for immortality.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.850
But nanotechnology is
just the beginning.

13:36.884 --> 13:40.888
KAKU: The next era will be when
we tinker with our genes.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.626
FARSAD: We're going to start
building these perfect humans

13:46.659 --> 13:49.796
that don't have any problems.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.965
You know, kids aren't
going to have acne,

13:51.999 --> 13:53.800
like, that's not going
to be a thing.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.835
There won't be an awkward phase.

13:55.869 --> 13:59.706
Like the genes that, like,
make your mom call you

13:59.739 --> 14:01.208
too many times in a week,

14:01.241 --> 14:02.742
they're going to
get rid of that,

14:02.775 --> 14:06.679
so I think in some ways
that's very exciting.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.415
NARRATOR: Scientists are already
beginning to take

14:08.448 --> 14:11.985
their first steps towards
changing our genetic code,

14:12.019 --> 14:13.887
with gene editing.

14:13.921 --> 14:17.991
Using restriction enzymes, also
known as molecular scissors,

14:18.025 --> 14:21.428
it's possible to actually
snip apart DNA,

14:21.461 --> 14:23.396
and then either splice in

14:23.430 --> 14:26.366
or remove small parts
of the strand.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.400
BRYAN JOHNSON:
Where we can actually

14:27.434 --> 14:29.202
take snippets of this code,

14:29.236 --> 14:32.572
and change it out,
either in embryos or in adults.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.575
So the first one
just happened in China.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.411
JON SPAIHTS: Things that were
thought to be impediments

14:38.445 --> 14:40.847
are falling left and right.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.550
Like the fact that
you never grow new teeth,

14:43.583 --> 14:45.718
or the fact that we thought,
until relatively recently,

14:45.752 --> 14:47.720
that you never grow
new brain cells.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.257
We have now grown new teeth
in people's jaws,

14:50.290 --> 14:52.025
starting from germ cells.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.594
We've discovered that
neurogenesis in the brain

14:54.627 --> 14:58.198
is normal into adulthood,
and can be stimulated.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.068
Those are things
we're going to crack.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.570
JOHNSON: We're born with
an expiration date.

15:03.603 --> 15:08.308
Our genetic code is set
to expire in a certain range.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.877
The question I have is, why?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.780
Can we program that so
it extends the expiration date?

15:13.813 --> 15:17.884
Can we program that so it
eliminates the expiration date?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.253
NARRATOR: Manipulating the very
building blocks of life

15:20.287 --> 15:24.057
may be the key to unlocking
the fountain of youth.

15:24.091 --> 15:27.760
KAKU: We will use science to
begin the process of slowing,

15:27.794 --> 15:31.798
and perhaps even stopping,
the aging process.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.833
Perhaps our children,
our grandchildren,

15:33.866 --> 15:38.471
will hit the age of 30,
and simply [snaps] stop.

15:38.505 --> 15:41.441
NICE: I'm vain.
I am very vain, okay?

15:41.474 --> 15:44.277
So if I can look like I'm 30
for 100 years, guess what.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.246
I'm going for that.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.580
NARRATOR: Who wouldn't?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.149
In the future,
genetic engineering

15:49.182 --> 15:52.285
will let us notch
many more years on our belt.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.756
But even now, some humans
have been lucky enough

15:56.789 --> 15:58.525
to be born with genetic code

15:58.558 --> 16:02.195
that allows them to live
extremely long lives.

16:02.229 --> 16:05.198
If your health is
your most valuable possession,

16:05.232 --> 16:08.835
it's like winning
the genetic Powerball jackpot.

16:08.868 --> 16:13.140
VALTER LONGO: Emma is the oldest
person in the history of Italy.

16:58.885 --> 17:01.088
NARRATOR: Emma is a rare case.

17:01.121 --> 17:06.726
She was born with longevity
encoded in her DNA.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.929
But even so, she would never
have gotten this far

17:09.962 --> 17:12.532
without a really good
and attentive doctor.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.124
NARRATOR: Sadly,
Emma passed away

17:37.157 --> 17:39.426
just as we finished production.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.861
But imagine a future
where genetic engineering

17:41.894 --> 17:44.764
will treat the causes
of aging itself.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.134
A 117-year-old like Emma

17:47.167 --> 17:52.539
would be able to hear perfectly,
walk, even dance the tango.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.607
DIAMANDIS: We're going to
completely transform medicine.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.609
It's going to become
personalized.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.811
This is perfect for you,
for your genomics,

17:58.845 --> 17:59.879
for your exact situation.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.381
It's predictive.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.283
Your genes tell us
you're likely to come down

18:03.316 --> 18:06.653
with this cardiac syndrome
or this cancer,

18:06.686 --> 18:10.790
and we're going to stop it from
happening in the first place.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.292
NARRATOR: Remember those
designer babies

18:12.325 --> 18:14.261
we'll all be making
in the future?

18:14.294 --> 18:15.928
Well, at present,

18:15.962 --> 18:17.797
genetic engineering hasn't
gone down that path.

18:17.830 --> 18:22.469
But scientists have already made
great strides in gene therapy

18:22.502 --> 18:24.271
to help cure disease.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.572
EVAN DAUGHARTHY:
All human disease

18:25.605 --> 18:28.641
is a product
of molecular defects.

18:28.675 --> 18:31.911
What we've invented is a way
to look inside the cells,

18:31.944 --> 18:34.814
and we actually see
what mutations are present.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.783
Once we understand the problem,

18:36.816 --> 18:38.651
then we can say,
oh, here's a drug

18:38.685 --> 18:42.955
that will turn that gene back on
or fix that DNA mutation.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.924
NARRATOR: Once we are able
to pinpoint

18:44.957 --> 18:47.627
and change issues
at a genetic level,

18:47.660 --> 18:50.163
humanity will be able
to avoid terminal illness.

18:50.197 --> 18:54.967
And that will revolutionize our
entire approach to how we live.

18:55.001 --> 18:57.437
MATT MIRA:
Yeah, I'd like the metabolism

18:57.470 --> 19:01.274
and desire to eat
of a long distance runner.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.442
That's what I'd like.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.377
That's sad? That's what I want.

19:04.411 --> 19:08.715
THURSTON: I can see people
having the time to avoid regret,

19:08.748 --> 19:10.983
try to make good on mistakes
that they've made.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.719
Think about the people
you've lost.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.388
What would be different if
they had lived an extra year,

19:15.422 --> 19:17.390
or five years, or a decade?

19:17.424 --> 19:19.125
What would you have told them?

19:19.158 --> 19:22.529
So there is a very emotional
and sentimental component

19:22.562 --> 19:24.264
beyond the science.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.802
NARRATOR: But with
genetic engineering,

19:29.836 --> 19:32.239
we may just be opening
a Pandora's box

19:32.272 --> 19:35.675
that we're not
prepared to handle.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.811
In the process of making
a better version of ourselves,

19:38.845 --> 19:42.249
we also might be taking away
some of the very characteristics

19:42.282 --> 19:45.218
that we value the most.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.353
SOULE: It would take away
a lot of the things

19:46.386 --> 19:47.654
that I think are important

19:47.687 --> 19:49.389
about myself and
my place in the world.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.225
NICE: The big moral question
will be designer babies.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.327
The only people who are worried
about designer babies

19:54.361 --> 19:56.263
are the people
who don't have babies,

19:56.296 --> 19:58.365
'cause I have three,
and I wish to God

19:58.398 --> 20:01.234
I could have designed
each and every one of them.

20:01.268 --> 20:06.439
AMY WEBB: Genetic engineering is
such a loaded, politicized term.

20:06.473 --> 20:07.840
CHURCH: I think
the biggest risk is

20:07.874 --> 20:11.411
there is a great tendency
for uniformity,

20:11.444 --> 20:13.179
and I think that's
very dangerous.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.781
DVORSKY:
There is definite concern

20:14.814 --> 20:17.950
that if you start to eliminate
conditions like autism,

20:17.984 --> 20:19.552
or even depression,

20:19.586 --> 20:22.589
what kind of diversity would
we be losing as a whole?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.023
Some of the world's
most famous artists

20:24.056 --> 20:25.892
and some of the world's
greatest scientists

20:25.925 --> 20:28.227
have had some
of these conditions.

20:28.261 --> 20:29.729
I think, as time passes,

20:29.762 --> 20:32.131
and as we harness
our genetic technologies,

20:32.164 --> 20:34.033
we will and we should
come to appreciate

20:34.066 --> 20:36.102
what's regarded
as neuro-diversity,

20:36.135 --> 20:37.770
that there's more than
one way of thinking,

20:37.804 --> 20:40.072
there's more than one way
of looking at the world.

20:40.106 --> 20:42.475
NARRATOR: That will be
our greatest challenge,

20:42.509 --> 20:45.211
not to throw out the baby
with the bathwater.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.615
As we eliminate traits
we deem unhealthy or bad,

20:48.648 --> 20:51.083
we're going to have to make sure
we don't eliminate

20:51.117 --> 20:54.321
the very things that
make us individuals.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.923
It's going to be
a real balancing act.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.892
DIAMANDIS: Our genomics is a way
to really extend

20:59.926 --> 21:03.463
the healthy human life span
at least a couple of decades.

21:03.496 --> 21:07.567
And then it starts
getting interesting.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.302
NARRATOR: In the future,

21:09.336 --> 21:12.839
nanotechnology is going to fix
our cells and our bodies.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.408
Genetic engineering will
pick up the slack

21:15.442 --> 21:17.477
and enable us
to eradicate disease

21:17.510 --> 21:19.145
and to pick out the very traits

21:19.178 --> 21:21.180
that will keep us
fit and healthy.

21:21.213 --> 21:23.149
All of this is amazing.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.652
But when we start talking
about immortality,

21:25.685 --> 21:28.355
that's a whole other
can of worms.

21:28.388 --> 21:32.158
If we really are serious about
getting to forever-land,

21:32.191 --> 21:34.827
we'll have to replace
our carbon-based human bodies

21:34.861 --> 21:39.699
and upload ourselves
to a supercomputer.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.869
Now that's going to raise
some serious issues.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.610
OSCAR: No, that's insane.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.312
EVA: I spend all my time
there anyway. We both do.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.314
OSCAR: There are boundaries,
Eva.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.850
There are lines you can't cross,
even for us.

21:57.884 --> 22:00.520
We don't even know
all the risks.

22:00.553 --> 22:03.189
What's to stop you from
being copied or hacked?

22:03.222 --> 22:05.057
EVA: And if the only place
I live is here,

22:05.091 --> 22:09.061
I could fall off a balcony
when I'm not paying attention.

22:09.095 --> 22:12.665
I want to live in the digital
world permanently, Oscar.

22:12.699 --> 22:18.371
Why worry about pain and death,
if we can live forever there?

22:18.405 --> 22:19.506
OSCAR: Does it even count
as living

22:19.539 --> 22:21.708
if your physical body is dead?

22:21.741 --> 22:23.410
EVA: I know what I've got to do,

22:23.443 --> 22:26.278
but I would rather do it
with your support.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.989
NARRATOR: It may look like
sci-fi, but this is your future.

22:37.023 --> 22:40.326
These are your new,
unimaginable choices.

22:40.359 --> 22:45.064
So, given the chance,
would you upload your brain?

22:49.368 --> 22:50.937
NARRATOR: Okay,
in the deep future

22:50.970 --> 22:53.840
we're going to have tiny robots
in our veins

22:53.873 --> 22:56.275
carrying medicine to our cells
and fixing them,

22:56.308 --> 22:58.177
which sounds pretty cool.

22:58.210 --> 23:02.014
And on top of that, we'll be
able to alter our genetic code

23:02.048 --> 23:04.551
to make most diseases
simply disappear,

23:04.584 --> 23:07.386
and deliver drastically
longer lives.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.422
How long? Who knows?

23:09.456 --> 23:11.724
Centuries, maybe more.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.059
ROSE EVELETH:
Over the past 150 years,

23:13.092 --> 23:15.127
we've basically doubled
life expectancy.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.596
And that's happened
through vaccines,

23:16.629 --> 23:18.097
through, you know, hygiene,

23:18.130 --> 23:19.799
through understanding
how disease works.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.801
I mean, that is incredible.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.036
WEBB: But we are still
biologically hindered

23:24.070 --> 23:25.938
by the squishy computer
in our heads.

23:25.972 --> 23:31.377
There are facets of our human
brains that hold us back.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.579
NARRATOR: But no matter
how advanced

23:32.612 --> 23:34.614
our medical technologies get,

23:34.647 --> 23:36.916
there will always be
new viruses,

23:36.949 --> 23:38.785
cells will always decay,

23:38.818 --> 23:41.420
and you can always
just simply fall,

23:41.454 --> 23:44.423
hit your head,
and lights out forever.

23:44.457 --> 23:45.892
In the deep future,

23:45.925 --> 23:49.328
failing organs will be
replaceable or fixable.

23:49.361 --> 23:52.231
Even now, we can live
without arms and legs,

23:52.264 --> 23:54.100
kidneys and lungs,

23:54.133 --> 23:59.506
but there's only one body part
we can't live without.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.941
GRAZIANO: You run into this
limit where it becomes necessary

24:01.974 --> 24:04.010
to do something about
the brain and the mind.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.978
And that's where you get
into all this business

24:06.012 --> 24:09.849
of mind uploading.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.684
NARRATOR: If we want
to live forever,

24:11.718 --> 24:13.853
humanity may have to become
at least partly,

24:13.886 --> 24:16.523
if not completely, digital.

24:18.558 --> 24:19.926
If we want to bridge the chasm

24:19.959 --> 24:22.995
separating longevity
and immortality,

24:23.029 --> 24:24.931
we may have to make
the giant leap

24:24.964 --> 24:27.466
of uploading the information
from our brains

24:27.500 --> 24:29.836
into a digital network.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.174
KAKU: We've had these
multibillion-dollar projects

24:35.207 --> 24:39.278
to break open
the boundaries of science.

24:39.311 --> 24:43.550
The next big program is
the Connectome Project--

24:43.583 --> 24:46.953
to map the entire brain.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.389
DVORSKY: So mind uploading will
initially be a technology

24:50.422 --> 24:51.891
that's used for life extension,

24:51.924 --> 24:53.993
for someone who is near death,

24:54.026 --> 24:56.362
or for someone who
has recently died.

24:56.395 --> 24:57.997
And the idea is that,

24:58.030 --> 24:59.966
you take all their memories
and their personality,

24:59.999 --> 25:02.669
and you can somehow copy that

25:02.702 --> 25:05.171
and then transfer that
into a digital medium,

25:05.204 --> 25:08.074
for life in a supercomputer.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.976
SOULE: I understand
the attractiveness of it.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.912
Like, it's fun to think about.
Because it's immortality.

25:12.945 --> 25:15.582
NARRATOR: That means
by the Year Million epoch,

25:15.615 --> 25:18.050
there will be humans
who are all computer.

25:18.084 --> 25:21.854
It's a far-out idea,
and it's also far off.

25:21.888 --> 25:24.557
Scientists are just starting
to tackle the problem

25:24.591 --> 25:29.095
of how to make
this technology a reality.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.030
PHILIP ROSEDALE: Getting the
information out of your brain

25:31.063 --> 25:33.199
is a problem that nobody knows
how to solve yet.

25:33.232 --> 25:36.268
The technologies that you might
use to go inside a living brain

25:36.302 --> 25:37.770
would destroy it.

25:37.804 --> 25:38.838
MICHAEL GRAZIANO:
A lot has to get done

25:38.871 --> 25:40.607
before we can figure out

25:40.640 --> 25:46.045
whether we can take a pattern
of connectivity from a brain

25:46.078 --> 25:48.615
and upload it or copy it.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.883
It's going to happen,
I'm positive of that.

25:50.917 --> 25:54.420
Everything is moving
that direction.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.188
KAKU: Believe it or not,

25:56.222 --> 26:00.627
we can actually upload memories
and record memories in mice.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.895
Eventually we'll do it
with primates,

26:02.929 --> 26:05.431
and after that, perhaps
Alzheimer's patients.

26:05.464 --> 26:08.868
You'll have a brain chip,
you'll push it,

26:08.901 --> 26:13.139
and memories come floating
into your hippocampus.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.107
ANDERS SANDBERG:
The most likely early method

26:15.141 --> 26:18.878
of creating a brain emulation
would start with taking a brain

26:18.911 --> 26:21.313
and then slicing it up
and scanning it.

26:21.347 --> 26:25.217
From this data, you would
reconstruct the neural network,

26:25.251 --> 26:28.921
which would then be run
on a suitable supercomputer,

26:28.955 --> 26:30.757
connected to a virtual body.

26:30.790 --> 26:34.093
NICE: Boom! You now live
in the computer.

26:34.126 --> 26:38.064
You, your essence now lives
in the computer.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.166
NARRATOR: Once we shed
our physical bodies,

26:40.199 --> 26:43.602
we will exist only as
a computer copy of our brains.

26:43.636 --> 26:45.471
It's hard to imagine exactly,

26:45.504 --> 26:50.509
but basically you'd be digital
information stored on a server.

26:50.542 --> 26:54.413
But will we still be human if we
aren't made of flesh and blood?

26:54.446 --> 26:55.948
SANDBERG: I think mind uploading

26:55.982 --> 26:58.818
is one of the most easily
understandable steps

26:58.851 --> 27:02.789
where we could go
from human to post-human.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.290
NARRATOR:
Okay, hold on a minute.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.858
Post-human?

27:05.892 --> 27:07.927
How's that going to work?

27:07.960 --> 27:10.997
What does that even look like?

27:11.030 --> 27:13.432
DVORSKY: A post-human is
a completely digitized human

27:13.465 --> 27:15.367
that might still retain
many human attributes,

27:15.401 --> 27:18.137
but has shirked
their biological lineage,

27:18.170 --> 27:19.872
living in a digital existence.

27:19.906 --> 27:23.175
SANDBERG: Those post-humans
would still laugh at jokes,

27:23.209 --> 27:24.977
they would still love,

27:25.011 --> 27:28.848
they would still remember their
childhood as biological humans.

27:28.881 --> 27:32.151
It's just that
an uploaded post-human

27:32.184 --> 27:34.954
will also be
potentially immortal,

27:34.987 --> 27:39.391
able to copy himself,
and edit their brain.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.527
NICE: I mean, listen,
I know that right now

27:41.560 --> 27:44.997
everything that I touch,
feel, taste, see,

27:45.031 --> 27:49.568
is nothing more than a chemical
and electrical exchange

27:49.601 --> 27:52.304
happening synaptically
inside this brain.

27:52.338 --> 27:55.007
So why not allow that to happen
inside of a computer?

27:55.041 --> 27:57.744
NARRATOR: Okay, that sounds
all well and good.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.311
But wouldn't you miss your body?

27:59.345 --> 28:01.213
I certainly would.

28:01.247 --> 28:06.652
What does it mean to feel when
there's nothing to feel with?

28:06.685 --> 28:08.187
THURSTON: The pursuit of
what it is to be human

28:08.220 --> 28:10.222
is to achieve a higher level
of consciousness,

28:10.256 --> 28:12.859
and like, is a human
without a body,

28:12.892 --> 28:17.196
is a mind only being,
in some ways more conscious?

28:17.229 --> 28:20.332
Or is the body, is that of what
it means to be human?

28:20.366 --> 28:23.535
I, I don't know, man,
this is weird.

28:23.569 --> 28:25.872
NARRATOR:
In this Year Million scenario,

28:25.905 --> 28:27.606
we could achieve
everlasting life

28:27.639 --> 28:31.277
by unshackling our consciousness
from our bodies.

28:35.581 --> 28:40.086
It's either the end point for
humanity, or it's the beginning.

28:40.119 --> 28:42.855
And some believe that humanity
will have entered

28:42.889 --> 28:46.258
what religion has called heaven.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.127
DVORSKY: This has been the goal
of our species

28:48.160 --> 28:51.864
since we first started to wonder
is there life after death?

28:51.898 --> 28:54.100
Imagining that the end state,

28:54.133 --> 28:55.301
whether it be ascending
into heaven

28:55.334 --> 28:57.804
or achieving a state of nirvana,

28:57.837 --> 29:00.807
would be this perpetual
state of bliss.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.876
I mean, this living
forever in paradise,

29:03.910 --> 29:07.046
that could very well be
the end state of civilization.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.148
PAUL BETTNER: Like the
technology that we're working on

29:09.181 --> 29:11.383
will enable something that's
almost indistinguishable

29:11.417 --> 29:14.453
from what we've been describing
as heaven and the afterlife

29:14.486 --> 29:16.956
for millennia.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.958
NICE: That's funny that
some people feel like

29:18.991 --> 29:20.827
that may be what heaven will be,

29:20.860 --> 29:24.130
is that we've found a way
to upload our consciousness

29:24.163 --> 29:27.433
to a computer,
and then we create constructs,

29:27.466 --> 29:31.070
ones that we know we would love,

29:31.103 --> 29:33.940
where we're around family
and loving friends

29:33.973 --> 29:38.677
and having experiences
into perpetuity.

29:38.710 --> 29:42.748
My only caveat: I want to be
able to pull my own plug

29:42.781 --> 29:45.985
to self-terminate when I want.

29:46.018 --> 29:49.822
Otherwise you're trapped
in that computer.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.493
NARRATOR: Heaven on Earth?

29:54.526 --> 29:57.864
More like heaven in the cloud,
but a very different cloud

29:57.897 --> 30:00.799
than the one with cherubs
shooting arrows at each other.

30:00.833 --> 30:05.204
We're talking about everlasting
life in a digital paradise.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.539
Humanity may be heading
in that direction.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.842
But should we let it?

30:09.876 --> 30:11.277
EVELETH:
There are some ethicists

30:11.310 --> 30:13.980
who think that if
we totally curb aging,

30:14.013 --> 30:15.781
that we're actually messing
with evolution in a way

30:15.814 --> 30:17.016
that we've never done before,

30:17.049 --> 30:18.851
and that we should
not mess with.

30:18.885 --> 30:20.386
You've sort of sold your soul
to the devil, in a lot of ways.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.688
You've given up some
essential humanity.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.623
SOULE: It starts to
drastically change

30:24.656 --> 30:27.894
what it means to be a person
and a human being,

30:27.927 --> 30:30.496
and have, you know,
even metaphysical stuff,

30:30.529 --> 30:32.031
what it means to have a soul.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.200
THURSTON: So much of what
it means to be a person

30:34.233 --> 30:37.036
is connected to the end
of personhood,

30:37.069 --> 30:39.872
that we try to live
as hard as we can,

30:39.906 --> 30:42.574
and do as much as we can,
before we can't anymore.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.010
SPAIHTS: It's going to require

30:44.043 --> 30:47.213
a complete internal redesign
of the self,

30:47.246 --> 30:50.216
because every way
we think about ourselves

30:50.249 --> 30:52.684
is calibrated against
the milestones

30:52.718 --> 30:55.554
of a life of a certain span.

30:55.587 --> 30:59.525
GREENE: I'd like to think that
what makes us who we are

30:59.558 --> 31:01.327
transcends our physical form.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.830
It transcends whether we're
made up of molecules and atoms

31:04.863 --> 31:07.033
and cells and neurons,

31:07.066 --> 31:10.569
and if we evolve
to a digital form,

31:10.602 --> 31:14.040
the essence of who we are
will stay with us.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.008
DIAMANDIS:
Human desire to contribute,

31:16.042 --> 31:18.844
for love and for connection,
to learn.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.412
Will those things come with us?

31:20.446 --> 31:23.916
Is it genetic, is it in
the structure of our brain?

31:23.950 --> 31:28.720
All of this stuff is insane,
until it happens.

31:28.754 --> 31:30.022
ROSEDALE: I think without death,

31:30.056 --> 31:32.124
our life still does
have purpose,

31:32.158 --> 31:35.527
because we always seem
to seek to do great things.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.396
And I bet that we do that even,

31:37.429 --> 31:40.866
you know,
with infinite life spans.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.802
NARRATOR: In the far future,
when we find eternity,

31:43.835 --> 31:46.038
we may lose our bodies,
but hopefully,

31:46.072 --> 31:47.940
we will not lose our humanity.

31:47.974 --> 31:49.908
And until that day arrives,

31:49.942 --> 31:53.079
for those desperate for
a shot at immortality today,

31:53.112 --> 31:56.815
their only chance may just be
to go into a deep freeze,

31:56.848 --> 31:59.418
until the deep future arrives.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.890
NARRATOR: Once scientists
perfect nanotechnology,

32:04.923 --> 32:07.626
gene therapy,
and mind uploading,

32:07.659 --> 32:09.395
we'll live a whole lot longer.

32:09.428 --> 32:12.298
But what do we do now if we want
to live to see that future?

32:12.331 --> 32:13.765
There's really just one thing

32:13.799 --> 32:16.002
that might give us that chance
at immortality.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.237
It's a long shot,
and it's expensive,

32:18.270 --> 32:21.440
and no one really knows
if it will even work.

32:21.473 --> 32:26.012
It's something called
cryonic preservation.

32:26.045 --> 32:29.081
SANDBERG: Cryonics is the idea
that you can take somebody

32:29.115 --> 32:31.250
who's dying and freeze them,

32:31.283 --> 32:33.986
in the hope that future medicine
will be advanced enough

32:34.020 --> 32:37.189
to both treat whatever
they were dying of,

32:37.223 --> 32:41.527
and the damage we got
from the cryonic suspension.

32:41.560 --> 32:45.331
I'm signed up for cryonics
because I like being alive,

32:45.364 --> 32:48.000
I want to have that
small extra chance.

32:48.034 --> 32:51.137
Maybe it's between 1% and 50%,

32:51.170 --> 32:56.542
but that's still much better
than 100% chance of dying.

32:56.575 --> 32:59.278
NARRATOR: It sounds crazy,
and many people think it is,

32:59.311 --> 33:01.547
but it's kind of like
playing the lottery--

33:01.580 --> 33:03.815
the upside would be huge.

33:03.849 --> 33:05.317
FARSAD: It's a way
of time traveling.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.953
Put me to sleep
when I'm at my cutest,

33:07.986 --> 33:11.957
and then I'll wake up like,
you know, 100 years from now,

33:11.990 --> 33:13.859
maybe 1,000 years from now

33:13.892 --> 33:15.894
and then I'll see what
it's like out there.

33:15.927 --> 33:19.165
Like is my favorite brunch place
still open?

33:19.198 --> 33:20.566
NARRATOR: Of course
that doesn't mean

33:20.599 --> 33:23.001
there might not be some
major issues facing you

33:23.035 --> 33:24.803
even if you hit that jackpot.

33:24.836 --> 33:25.837
EVELETH: One of the huge
problems

33:25.871 --> 33:27.873
of waking up in 150 years,

33:27.906 --> 33:30.076
regardless of how intact
or un-intact your body is,

33:30.109 --> 33:32.511
is that things will be
so different,

33:32.544 --> 33:35.581
it's going to be very difficult
to acclimate.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.850
MARTIN REES: You'd be revived
into a completely alien world.

33:38.884 --> 33:40.552
The question is,
what would they do with you?

33:40.586 --> 33:43.355
Would they put you in a zoo?
Would they look after you?

33:43.389 --> 33:44.823
And how would you feel?

33:44.856 --> 33:47.693
NARRATOR: Yes. No, thank you.
Not for me.

33:47.726 --> 33:50.562
I'm not planning on being a
spectacle in someone else's zoo,

33:50.596 --> 33:52.164
that's for sure.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.566
But the truth is, we don't know
what life will be like,

33:54.600 --> 33:57.936
and for some people, cryonics
offer the only glimmer of hope,

33:57.969 --> 34:01.507
no matter how slight, for
continued life in the future.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.342
NEWSCASTER: The letter
to a British judge

34:03.375 --> 34:07.012
from a teenage girl suffering
from cancer was heartbreaking.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.548
'I'm only 14 years old
and I don't want to die,

34:09.581 --> 34:11.117
but I know I am going to die.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.719
I think being cryo-preserved
gives me a chance

34:13.752 --> 34:17.856
to be cured and woken up, even
in hundreds of years' time.'

34:17.889 --> 34:22.394
After consulting with
her family, the judge agreed.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.029
SANDBERG: In this
particular case,

34:24.062 --> 34:26.965
a young girl wanted to have
a cryonic suspension,

34:26.998 --> 34:29.935
because she was 14 years old
and dying of cancer.

34:29.968 --> 34:32.104
Unfortunately,
her father disagreed,

34:32.138 --> 34:37.109
so it ended up a court case,
which caused a bit of attention.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.610
When the judge found that yes,

34:38.644 --> 34:42.047
of course she is allowed
to be suspended.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.983
WOMAN: She was very pleased
with the decision

34:45.016 --> 34:47.119
to allow her to be
cryo-preserved,

34:47.153 --> 34:50.422
which gave her great comfort
in the last days of her life.

34:50.456 --> 34:51.890
NARRATOR: Who can blame
the poor girl

34:51.923 --> 34:54.893
for wanting
one more shot at life?

34:54.926 --> 34:57.229
Of course, cryonics has
many skeptics,

34:57.263 --> 34:58.630
but that hasn't stopped people

34:58.664 --> 35:01.099
from planning for
the best-case scenario.

35:01.133 --> 35:03.902
Take these guys
in Sheffield, England.

35:03.935 --> 35:08.006
They're part of a non-profit
organization called Cryonics UK,

35:08.039 --> 35:10.276
dedicated to preparing
the recently deceased,

35:10.309 --> 35:13.779
who desire it,
for cryonic preservation.

35:16.982 --> 35:19.918
ALAN SINCLAIR: Millions
of things come from dead people.

35:19.951 --> 35:23.989
Hearts, livers,
kidneys, corneas.

35:24.022 --> 35:26.925
I mean, the fact is,
they're not dead.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.093
DEREK WATKINSON: I've never been
happy with the fact

35:28.126 --> 35:30.028
that we have to die.

35:30.061 --> 35:34.132
I heard that there were people
who were interested in cryonics,

35:34.166 --> 35:37.803
and so I, I went with my family,
just to find out more.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.838
And suddenly it was
a eureka moment for me.

35:39.871 --> 35:42.374
It was sort of,
ah, it's a possibility.

35:42.408 --> 35:49.114
*

35:49.147 --> 35:50.982
NARRATOR: These guys
aren't speculating,

35:51.016 --> 35:54.786
what you're seeing here is just
a test run for the real thing.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.822
MAN: Once you get past
the cooling-down stage,

35:56.855 --> 35:59.157
you then go into surgery,
where you wash the blood out,

35:59.191 --> 36:01.893
replace it with the antifreeze.

36:01.927 --> 36:04.129
After that,
it goes into the body bag,

36:04.162 --> 36:06.965
and into the dry ice cooler.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.900
DVORSKY: Some people opt to have
their whole bodies preserved,

36:08.934 --> 36:11.237
and some people just simply opt
to have their heads preserved.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.638
That's where your memories are,

36:12.671 --> 36:15.874
and that's where
you are as a person.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.577
MIRA: You know, of all the short
television movies,

36:18.610 --> 36:20.879
there's one I am constantly
thinking about.

36:20.912 --> 36:24.850
It's Welcome Back, Mr. Fox.

36:24.883 --> 36:28.754
DOCTOR: Your Cryonics Society
filed for bankruptcy yesterday,

36:28.787 --> 36:31.923
and they were all set to move
you out into the street.

36:31.957 --> 36:36.262
MIRA: It's about a man
who's cryogenically frozen.

36:36.295 --> 36:40.866
He comes back,
and he's a head in a jar.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.568
REES: Even if the body
could be revived...

36:42.601 --> 36:43.902
MR. FOX: What's going on here?

36:43.935 --> 36:45.504
REES:
...it's the separate question

36:45.537 --> 36:47.239
whether the brain's memories
would be revived.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.007
MR. FOX: Don't do this to me.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.676
DOCTOR: It's alright.
MR. FOX: Don't put me in here!

36:50.709 --> 36:52.911
REES: Whether you'll be
the same person, or not at all.

36:52.944 --> 36:56.782
MR. FOX: No!

36:56.815 --> 36:58.617
MIRA: That's a very
cautionary tale.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.352
You don't know
what you're in for

37:00.386 --> 37:02.354
if you're going to
cryogenically freeze yourself.

37:02.388 --> 37:05.291
Like Ted Williams' head is
frozen in Arizona somewhere.

37:05.324 --> 37:07.025
I don't know what,

37:07.058 --> 37:09.861
if their plan is to put him
onto a robot baseball body

37:09.895 --> 37:11.430
at some point,

37:11.463 --> 37:15.233
or to thaw him out,
reattach his head to something,

37:15.267 --> 37:17.235
and then have him teach
hitting clinics.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.770
GRAZIANO: Maybe at some
future date,

37:18.804 --> 37:21.407
the technology will be there
to read the brain,

37:21.440 --> 37:22.974
or put your head
on another body,

37:23.008 --> 37:25.711
or upload you to a computer,
or something like that.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.746
So that's the hope there.

37:27.779 --> 37:28.780
TIM GIBSON:
It's a little bit exciting,

37:28.814 --> 37:30.282
and a little bit terrifying.

37:30.316 --> 37:31.817
You can either give in,

37:31.850 --> 37:35.387
or you can fight the fear
and move through it.

37:35.421 --> 37:36.955
It's just like doing anything.

37:36.988 --> 37:39.458
You learn to control it,
you learn to understand it.

37:39.491 --> 37:42.494
Identifying things that
you could improve on.

37:42.528 --> 37:44.963
WATKINSON:
I was 14 when my dad died,

37:44.996 --> 37:47.933
so I think that might have had
something to do with it.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.635
It's not, doesn't seem
right somehow.

37:49.668 --> 37:53.171
All those years of knowledge
and experience, just gone.

37:53.204 --> 37:56.675
I suppose we are playing God,
but so what?

37:56.708 --> 37:59.511
I just want to be alive.

37:59.545 --> 38:02.614
MIRA: I think that eventually
you run into an issue

38:02.648 --> 38:08.854
where if you keep prolonging
life, is it worth prolonging?

38:08.887 --> 38:11.790
Is there a point where
we're just a head in a jar

38:11.823 --> 38:13.859
like in Futurama,

38:13.892 --> 38:16.662
where, you know, you can just
pull up the Richard Nixon head

38:16.695 --> 38:19.498
and have a conversation with it?

38:19.531 --> 38:23.369
Is that worth living?
Do I want to be a head in a jar?

38:25.404 --> 38:28.340
NARRATOR: Sounds like Matt's
not sold on cryonics,

38:28.374 --> 38:31.443
and in the future, it's possible
not everyone will be sold

38:31.477 --> 38:33.211
on all the technologies
available

38:33.244 --> 38:36.348
to prolong their lives.

38:36.382 --> 38:41.052
That means time will begin
to catch up with them.

38:41.086 --> 38:52.163
*

38:52.197 --> 38:57.202
[heart beating]

38:57.235 --> 39:00.338
JESS: Dad.

39:00.372 --> 39:02.974
NARRATOR: Like a heart attack
while you're gardening.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.377
[beeping]

39:10.682 --> 39:12.350
OSCAR: You said I was stabilized
three hours ago.

39:12.384 --> 39:15.220
JESS: Arterial plaque stabilizer
dosage, Oscar.

39:15.253 --> 39:16.722
OSCAR: Why do I need more shots?

39:16.755 --> 39:19.324
JESS: Stable doesn't
mean better, Dad.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.961
And a minor heart attack
is still a heart attack.

39:34.573 --> 39:35.907
OSCAR: Feels a bit better.

39:35.941 --> 39:38.343
JESS: This is why you need
your treatments.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.745
Look, Mom's been taking them
for years.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.413
I don't see why
you couldn't take them.

39:41.447 --> 39:45.350
OSCAR: You know I'm not like
your mother, honey.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.785
I'm not sure I want
to live forever.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.587
JESS: Well, you won't.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.388
According to my scan, if you
don't start getting treatments,

39:50.422 --> 39:52.924
you're looking at
another seven years.

39:52.958 --> 39:54.926
NARRATOR: I mean, for me,
the choice is simple--

39:54.960 --> 39:56.928
get those treatments,
and maybe live long enough

39:56.962 --> 40:00.131
to see the Cubs
win another World Series.

40:03.168 --> 40:06.304
Radical life extension might
come too late for you and me,

40:06.337 --> 40:08.940
but it's on its way,
and once it arrives,

40:08.974 --> 40:11.443
we're going to have
a lot of time on our hands.

40:11.477 --> 40:14.880
It could mean total freedom,
or endless stagnation.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.948
In Year Million,
we're going to find out.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.287
NARRATOR:
Okay, in the deep future

40:22.320 --> 40:24.422
your life span will be
exponentially longer

40:24.456 --> 40:26.257
than it is now.

40:26.291 --> 40:29.327
But what does that really mean
in your day-to-day existence?

40:29.360 --> 40:31.497
Let's take
the best-case scenario.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.665
Everything you've always
wanted to do--

40:33.699 --> 40:38.069
learn a new language,
play the piano, learn to paint.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.171
In the future you'll have
all the time in the world

40:40.205 --> 40:42.574
to do those things and more.

40:42.608 --> 40:47.012
That will change everything
about how we approach our lives.

40:51.517 --> 40:53.084
KAKU: It's unconscious,

40:53.118 --> 40:55.621
but you think about the day
you're going to die

40:55.654 --> 40:57.088
when you do anything.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.525
Going to college, getting a job,
retirement,

40:59.558 --> 41:05.997
all these things are predicated
on one fact, the day you die.

41:06.031 --> 41:09.434
GREENE: We could have
a really long lifespan.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.604
1,000 years, 100,000 years.

41:12.638 --> 41:14.472
NARRATOR: 100,000 years?

41:14.506 --> 41:16.975
That's hard to even imagine.

41:17.008 --> 41:19.444
DVORSKY: Once we achieve
this radical life extension,

41:19.477 --> 41:22.648
what some futurists refer to
as negligible senescence,

41:22.681 --> 41:24.883
where we've ceased to age,

41:24.916 --> 41:28.687
society as we know it
will change quite dramatically.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.556
We will continue to evolve
as individuals, you know,

41:30.589 --> 41:33.458
find new ways of interacting
with the world,

41:33.491 --> 41:37.195
develop new skills,
new relationships.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.731
SANDBERG: Currently,
our relationships are based on

41:39.765 --> 41:42.400
the idea that we are
supposed to stay together

41:42.433 --> 41:44.836
till death do us part.

41:44.870 --> 41:49.641
But if that is indefinitely,
they might not last that long.

41:49.675 --> 41:51.509
SOULE: I mean, I'd like to think
that, that there are marriages

41:51.543 --> 41:55.380
that could last five centuries
and everyone would be happy.

41:55.413 --> 41:57.482
But, you know, a marriage
that lasts five decades

41:57.515 --> 41:59.217
seems to strain
the emotional resources

41:59.250 --> 42:00.719
of most people these days.

42:00.752 --> 42:02.387
ANNALEE NEWITZ: People will have

42:02.420 --> 42:05.423
a much more do-it-yourself
approach to relationships,

42:05.456 --> 42:08.326
so kind of building the kinds of
relationships they want to have,

42:08.359 --> 42:12.230
building families that
they want to have.

42:12.263 --> 42:14.766
NARRATOR: Unlimited
relationships of every kind.

42:14.800 --> 42:18.069
Yes, I bet a lot of you
can get on board with that.

42:18.103 --> 42:22.273
But now let's look at
the not-awesome possibility

42:22.307 --> 42:24.375
of radical life extension.

42:24.409 --> 42:27.512
KAKU: The danger facing
a society that lives forever

42:27.545 --> 42:30.048
is stagnation.

42:30.081 --> 42:32.851
NARRATOR: Without death we may
just stop wanting or needing

42:32.884 --> 42:35.453
to do, well, anything.

42:35.486 --> 42:40.391
FARSAD: I feel like the idea
that you could die, you know,

42:40.425 --> 42:41.627
gives you some kind of urgency

42:41.660 --> 42:43.695
about what you do
with your life.

42:43.729 --> 42:47.065
Like are you going
to achieve your goals?

42:47.098 --> 42:51.937
Are you going to finally
take that trip to Barbados?

42:51.970 --> 42:55.140
NARRATOR: On the other hand many
futurists disregard the idea

42:55.173 --> 42:57.442
that death is what gets us
out of bed in the morning.

42:57.475 --> 42:59.077
DVORSKY:
There's this common argument

42:59.110 --> 43:01.312
against radical life extension
that I hear constantly,

43:01.346 --> 43:03.248
and that is, oh, why would
anyone want to live forever?

43:03.281 --> 43:05.150
We'd be so bored.

43:05.183 --> 43:08.419
And I'm like, are you serious?

43:08.453 --> 43:10.555
If anything, we're going to be
paralyzed by choice.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.257
Like what are we going to do
with ourselves,

43:12.290 --> 43:13.659
given that we have
all these ways

43:13.692 --> 43:15.460
of, you know,
engaging in the world

43:15.493 --> 43:19.130
and playing
and relating to each other.

43:19.164 --> 43:22.067
NARRATOR: Whether we learn
to kite surf and play the guitar

43:22.100 --> 43:23.835
or lay in bed all day,

43:23.869 --> 43:26.337
there are some
practical consequences

43:26.371 --> 43:28.406
to our radically longer lives.

43:28.439 --> 43:31.176
Without death, the world could
face a whole new array

43:31.209 --> 43:34.412
of population control issues.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.748
NEWITZ: That's where longevity
gets really sticky,

43:36.782 --> 43:39.517
because if we're not going
to overrun the planet

43:39.550 --> 43:42.153
with a bunch
of 100-year-old people,

43:42.187 --> 43:44.690
we really have to rethink

43:44.723 --> 43:48.326
how we manage populations
on the planet.

43:48.359 --> 43:49.861
N.K. JEMISIN: If we've suddenly
got 6 billion people

43:49.895 --> 43:51.496
that aren't going anywhere,

43:51.529 --> 43:53.364
why do we need to have
more children?

43:53.398 --> 43:56.201
Can this planet support
increasing numbers of people,

43:56.234 --> 43:59.270
as more and more
babies are born?

43:59.304 --> 44:03.474
What does it do to us if
we are nothing but adults,

44:03.508 --> 44:04.943
we don't have kids around?

44:04.976 --> 44:07.212
I think that's harmful.

44:07.245 --> 44:09.447
DVORSKY: Yes, there are many
challenges that will arise

44:09.480 --> 44:11.116
as a result of radical
life extension,

44:11.149 --> 44:12.951
such as
the overpopulation problem.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.319
But I suspect that
in the future,

44:14.352 --> 44:16.154
we will increasingly come
to possess tools

44:16.187 --> 44:19.224
that will allow us
to fix those problems.

44:19.257 --> 44:22.293
NARRATOR: But some of those
Year Million solutions could be

44:22.327 --> 44:26.998
as frightening as the original
problem of death once was.

44:27.032 --> 44:30.468
NEWITZ: In 500 years,
you could imagine a culture

44:30.501 --> 44:32.871
where we have
a regulatory agency

44:32.904 --> 44:35.473
that's in charge of who
gets to have a kid,

44:35.506 --> 44:38.043
because we got to keep
the population low enough

44:38.076 --> 44:42.047
to allow people to live
for a really long time.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.648
NARRATOR: I don't like
the sound of that.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.884
But that might not even be
the half of it.

44:45.917 --> 44:47.753
It could get worse.

44:47.786 --> 44:49.187
DIAMANDIS: People are worried

44:49.220 --> 44:51.489
about the inequality
of this technology.

44:51.522 --> 44:54.192
That it's going to come to
the wealthiest people first.

44:54.225 --> 44:55.927
MIRA: If you're looking
at prolonging your life,

44:55.961 --> 44:58.529
and it's a technology that only
the super rich can afford,

44:58.563 --> 45:00.198
what are you going
to end up with?

45:00.231 --> 45:03.101
You're going to end up with...

45:03.134 --> 45:05.103
pretty much what happens now.

45:05.136 --> 45:07.238
THURSTON: We already have
life extension right now,

45:07.272 --> 45:08.573
it's called being white.

45:08.606 --> 45:10.241
[laughs]

45:10.275 --> 45:12.177
Because of the health outcomes
and the level of care.

45:12.210 --> 45:17.382
Like regular doctor visits is a,
is a form of life extension.

45:17.415 --> 45:20.351
Healthcare is life extension.

45:20.385 --> 45:22.754
NARRATOR: These are the same
issues we're dealing with today.

45:22.788 --> 45:25.390
Seems like if we don't find
solutions for them now,

45:25.423 --> 45:27.759
it's only going to get worse
in the future.

45:27.793 --> 45:31.596
NICE: So what we need now
is to find equity

45:31.629 --> 45:36.601
so that all human beings
can live well.

45:36.634 --> 45:38.469
DIAMANDIS: But here's the fact.

45:38.503 --> 45:42.040
We're heading towards a world
of extraordinary abundance.

45:42.073 --> 45:45.243
You have access to the world's
information on Google,

45:45.276 --> 45:46.577
you have access
to megabit connections.

45:46.611 --> 45:48.413
So the poorest people
on the planet,

45:48.446 --> 45:50.715
8 billion people within
the next 10 years,

45:50.748 --> 45:54.219
will have access to
all of this capability.

45:54.252 --> 45:56.922
We are dematerializing,
demonetizing,

45:56.955 --> 45:59.490
and democratizing.

45:59.524 --> 46:01.392
NARRATOR: That certainly
would be the hope.

46:01.426 --> 46:04.095
That as we extend our life spans
further and further

46:04.129 --> 46:07.465
into the future,
perhaps even into eternity,

46:07.498 --> 46:11.837
we also ensure that society
advances at the same rate.

46:11.870 --> 46:16.574
Otherwise we're going to be
in for some serious problems.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.910
We've seen that
the quest of immortality

46:18.944 --> 46:21.312
raises all sorts
of sticky questions.

46:21.346 --> 46:24.349
It forces us to confront
the very fundamental question

46:24.382 --> 46:27.785
about what our purpose is
here on Earth, or beyond.

46:27.819 --> 46:32.457
Our desire for eternal life
could liberate us or destroy us.

46:32.490 --> 46:34.359
SPAIHTS: So the question
does become,

46:34.392 --> 46:39.330
when immortality arrives, what
are you going to do with it?

46:39.364 --> 46:40.765
NARRATOR: The final step
toward eternity

46:40.798 --> 46:43.501
will be a complete
paradigm change.

46:43.534 --> 46:46.504
It's when you step into
the screen you are watching,

46:46.537 --> 46:48.874
and it becomes your everything.

46:48.907 --> 46:52.177
All of society will
live digitally,

46:52.210 --> 46:54.980
in a virtual world
called the metaverse

46:55.013 --> 47:01.452
that is 1,000 times more intense
than the one around you now.

47:01.486 --> 47:04.689
It sounds like The Matrix,

47:04.722 --> 47:06.824
but it's the Year Million.
