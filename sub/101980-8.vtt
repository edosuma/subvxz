WEBVTT

01:00.561 --> 01:02.104
-And what's your name?
-Chloe.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.897
Chloe. Well, best of luck to you, Chloe.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.985
Of course we have to thank
all the moms and the aunts

01:08.068 --> 01:11.947
who traveled from far away
to be with their daughters today,

01:12.030 --> 01:13.740
stitching dresses, painting faces.

01:13.824 --> 01:16.243
I think we have time
to meet one more contestant

01:16.326 --> 01:19.079
who's down here on the end
twiddling her thumbs.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.707
What's your name, pretty lady?

01:21.790 --> 01:22.791
Leanne.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.002
Leanne, very nice to meet you.
Where were you born?

01:25.085 --> 01:26.336
Wisconsin.

01:28.255 --> 01:32.634
...the best of luck as they head into
the talent portion of the competition.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.303
I'm Dorothy Turner, 8 News.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.180
You're ruining this for me. Get up.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.222
-This is Julian.
-He's not answering.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.974
He must have slipped out this morning.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.769
Are they ready yet?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.145
Almost.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.777
-Et voilÃ .
-Great.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.322
Dorothy, are you sure that means
what we think it means?

03:18.073 --> 03:20.659
Of course.
What else could it possibly mean?

04:23.972 --> 04:25.265
George.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.059
Breakfast.

04:31.647 --> 04:35.275
So, I ordered your Betamax player.

04:35.359 --> 04:39.780
They are forecasting 15 inches,
but Stuart, our FedEx man, is very hardy.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.783
Midwestern stock. And if he could deliver
our credenza in Hurricane Sandy,

04:42.866 --> 04:46.370
then surely he can
deliver a Betamax in this.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.124
I know this tape is very important to you.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.503
I wanna help however I can.

04:57.089 --> 04:58.423
We made a deal.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.055
What is this?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.723
It was in your box.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.017
It must've fallen.

05:09.810 --> 05:13.730
I figured it might mean something to you.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.568
Then you know.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.654
It is time.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.867
It's right this way.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.960
Dorothy, how'd it go?

05:35.043 --> 05:36.753
Good. I think.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.006
He's asked to use the grill.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.716
My grill? For what?

05:41.341 --> 05:43.635
I don't know. He just asked.

05:46.597 --> 05:49.349
-Don't look at me like that, please.
-I'm not.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.101
I've got this under control.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.540
Leanne?

06:18.420 --> 06:19.838
I was at your house.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.841
Or what's left of it.

06:27.638 --> 06:32.559
If you ever wanted to talk to someone...
you know you can talk to me.

08:29.218 --> 08:31.136
Having a tea party, are we?

08:31.220 --> 08:32.471
You're making fun of me.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.308
What do you want, Julian?

08:37.392 --> 08:40.270
That whole charade
with the door and the music...

08:41.647 --> 08:42.856
you're not slick.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.026
And I'm only here
because you want me to be.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.821
You said if I wanted to talk.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.533
Yeah. I did say that.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.662
Okay, shoot.

09:00.457 --> 09:01.708
I don't know where to start.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.336
Well, you can start with her.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.923
That feels like some... deep shit.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.843
She reminds me of my mother.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.222
They have the same eyes.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.317
-Hello.
-Hi.

09:27.401 --> 09:30.362
-May I help you?
-I'm looking for Sean.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.572
Sean?

09:34.491 --> 09:36.952
Darling, this man says he knows you.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.966
Are you sure you want to sit out here?

09:51.967 --> 09:52.968
It's awfully cold.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.470
That's all right. This is perfect.

09:57.306 --> 09:58.307
Who's he looking for?

09:58.390 --> 10:00.559
Oh, we have a guest staying with us.

10:02.811 --> 10:06.315
So... how do you two know each other?

10:06.398 --> 10:10.235
It's not often I haven't met
such a good friend of Sean's.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.529
Sean, you wanna take that?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.531
He's a private investigator.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.201
Julian and I hired him
to look into Leanne.

10:17.868 --> 10:21.079
Oh, Sean. You didn't.

10:21.163 --> 10:23.874
I thought she had a shady past.
Clearly, I was way off base.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.252
Don't you think
you should have shared that with me?

10:27.336 --> 10:29.588
That our nanny was under investigation.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.423
Well, I didn't want to involve you.

10:31.507 --> 10:33.091
Well, I just feel like a fool.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.364
Well, now that I'm in the loop,
you better tell me everything.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.908
Anything that might help us understand
why they took Jericho.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.576
I'm not sure I have anything.

10:59.660 --> 11:00.661
How is that possible?

11:00.744 --> 11:03.080
When you looked into Leanne,
what did you find?

11:03.705 --> 11:04.748
Not much.

11:05.499 --> 11:10.504
Just a burnt up, old farmhouse.
Some kind of tragic accident.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.467
How close is your mother
with your aunt and uncle?

11:16.426 --> 11:18.554
Is he her brother?

11:19.388 --> 11:22.766
George and May are my chosen family.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.435
We're not actually related.

11:29.523 --> 11:33.777
They said that God sent them walking down
the road where I was buried in ash.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.949
They told me that God
had given me a second chance.

11:40.993 --> 11:43.829
Every detail we can learn
about these people is important.

11:43.912 --> 11:48.584
All information, no matter how seemingly
insignificant. It's Journalism 101.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.336
You okay?

11:51.420 --> 11:54.506
-I'm fine.
-Let me get you a drink.

11:54.590 --> 11:56.008
-I said I'm fine.
-I'll get it.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.635
Please... let me. This is my fault.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.185
What is this?

12:08.729 --> 12:10.272
Found them up here.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.065
Must've been our mom's.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.694
We're not supposed to listen to music.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.739
They say it's a dark temptation.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.909
But I don't understand that.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.494
Just feels like light to me.

12:27.539 --> 12:28.916
I wanna show you something.

12:31.502 --> 12:34.046
From some local news archive.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.119
Look at how she's holding me.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.498
It's like she wants to drop me.

13:11.542 --> 13:14.628
Dorothy would never
hold Jericho like that.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.797
What's Dorothy gotta do with it?

13:17.381 --> 13:19.466
I used to think
she was the perfect mother.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.553
She was so beautiful.

13:23.554 --> 13:24.555
Gentle.

13:26.557 --> 13:28.267
Was nothing like mine.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.565
But I was wrong about her.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.111
That's fucking unfair.

13:40.445 --> 13:43.782
What happened with the baby
was an accident. It wasn't her fault.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.075
Then whose fault was it?

13:45.784 --> 13:47.703
I'd probably blame God.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.123
If I thought there was a God to blame.

13:57.713 --> 13:59.214
For now, it's on me.

14:02.384 --> 14:06.972
I thought it would be safer to keep it
from you, and that was a mistake.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.141
We cannot lie to each other, Sean.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.351
Promise me.

14:13.645 --> 14:17.024
Sorry. Had to hit the restroom on the way.

14:18.317 --> 14:19.318
Thank you.

14:56.355 --> 14:58.106
Hey, Juju, it's Dottie.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.319
I really wouldn't call
if it wasn't important, but...

15:03.779 --> 15:06.490
I'm just having a really hard time.

15:08.825 --> 15:13.539
Jericho's just crying and crying,
and I have tried everything, and...

15:14.623 --> 15:19.586
I'm just really overwhelmed right now.

15:19.670 --> 15:23.131
So... maybe you could just come by...

15:23.924 --> 15:27.302
Juju, for, like, even a couple hours.

15:28.345 --> 15:33.267
Okay. Just call me back, okay? Bye.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.395
Why didn't you go?

15:38.647 --> 15:44.361
My dealer scored some great shit.
I couldn't pass that up.

15:45.571 --> 15:48.073
She was alone with his body for four days.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.495
All I can think is...

15:55.956 --> 15:57.374
what if I went?

15:57.457 --> 15:59.334
Why are you telling me this?

16:00.294 --> 16:02.421
What do you want?
Do you want me to feel sorry for her?

16:03.088 --> 16:04.089
No.

16:06.216 --> 16:08.927
It's just when a terrible thing happens...

16:10.596 --> 16:12.222
and you pretend that it didn't...

16:13.724 --> 16:15.559
it eats your insides.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.446
There was this green dress
that my mother loved...

16:30.490 --> 16:32.492
so I decided to destroy it.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.456
Try maybe make some room
for her to love me.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.169
I put it on the burner.

16:44.755 --> 16:47.508
Didn't know how fast fire grows.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.470
I wasn't even scared at all.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.306
I was just angry.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.852
It felt like I was burning too.

17:03.857 --> 17:07.152
My aunt and uncle said that
it must've been God working through me.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.281
That terrible things happen for a reason.

17:13.242 --> 17:14.409
Do you think that?

17:16.828 --> 17:18.747
I think that if that's God...

17:21.415 --> 17:23.292
then I don't want anything to do with him.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.006
He'll never leave this house without her.

17:28.674 --> 17:31.343
So our deal is safe
as long as we still have Leanne.

17:33.929 --> 17:36.265
All right. Let's go inside. It's frigid.

17:36.348 --> 17:37.975
I can grab you a blanket.

17:39.685 --> 17:42.563
That's very kind of you, Roscoe,
but it's okay.

17:42.646 --> 17:44.356
We need to check on George.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.233
It's just nice, the fresh air.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.610
I thought we might
stay out here for a little longer.

17:49.528 --> 17:53.907
I really am cold, but we can
continue speaking in the kitchen.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.367
Roscoe, what are you doing?

17:56.159 --> 17:57.619
I can't let you inside.

17:58.495 --> 17:59.580
Why not?

18:00.706 --> 18:04.918
He told me to keep you out here
until sunset... no matter what.

18:05.002 --> 18:06.003
Who?

18:08.172 --> 18:09.173
George.

18:14.845 --> 18:16.388
What do you think you're doing?

18:16.471 --> 18:18.807
I told you I wanted to help you!

18:18.891 --> 18:20.809
What, did you think you could trick us?

18:20.893 --> 18:24.563
You could just walk out of the house
without fulfilling your side of the deal?

18:26.106 --> 18:28.942
-Tell me!
-I needed time to prepare.

18:29.985 --> 18:32.070
We must do these things alone.

18:32.613 --> 18:34.698
-Prepare?
-Yes.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.201
We should all be ready.

18:37.743 --> 18:40.829
The reunion will happen
when the clock turns.

18:41.914 --> 18:43.665
This is certain.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.294
Good.

18:49.379 --> 18:50.380
It better.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.091
-I'm sorry, man.
-Just go.

18:53.175 --> 18:56.136
You don't understand. Listen to me, Sean.

18:57.804 --> 18:58.805
You know me.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.266
You know I'm a rational man.

19:01.975 --> 19:05.687
Something's happening to me.
Things are changing.

19:06.522 --> 19:08.357
They're shifting for the better.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.317
What do you mean?

19:10.400 --> 19:11.652
I can't explain it.

19:12.653 --> 19:14.905
All I know is that
it started when I met him.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.491
So when he asked me for a simple,
harmless task,

19:17.574 --> 19:19.409
I knew I needed to say yes.

19:19.493 --> 19:20.702
Roscoe, you need to go.

19:20.786 --> 19:22.871
I'm trying to say that you can trust them.

19:23.580 --> 19:24.957
They're not like us.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.211
They're special.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.860
I'm not supposed to do that.

19:54.403 --> 19:57.781
They say that anything
that feels good is dangerous.

21:35.671 --> 21:38.799
Christmas has always
been a time for sitting on Santa's lap

21:38.882 --> 21:41.301
and whispering wishes into his ear.

21:41.385 --> 21:46.598
But now child psychologists say that
this encourages manipulative behavior.

21:46.682 --> 21:48.767
They argue that children
should be encouraged

21:48.851 --> 21:52.271
to state their wishes
directly without playing games.

25:18.727 --> 25:20.521
I can't do it.

25:29.404 --> 25:30.948
Why are you holding that knife?

25:34.868 --> 25:36.370
Do you wanna hurt me?

25:39.748 --> 25:41.500
You said that you loved me.

25:46.505 --> 25:48.048
Everybody lies to me.

25:50.759 --> 25:53.053
She'll come for you.

25:53.804 --> 25:55.013
Let her.

25:56.431 --> 25:58.016
I can handle May.

25:59.017 --> 26:00.853
Not May.

26:43.020 --> 26:47.232
Oh, my God. Where did you come from?
Sir? Sir, are you okay?
