Riker to Ensign Crusher.

00:35.375 --> 00:37.375
Go ahead.

00:37.417 --> 00:38.917
Forget to set your

00:37.417 --> 00:38.917
alarm, Wesley?

00:38.959 --> 00:41.125
Yes, sir.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.333
I'm very sorry.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.291
I'll be right there.

00:52.917 --> 00:56.125
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:52.917 --> 00:56.125
<i>Stardate 43125.8.</i>

00:56.166 --> 00:58.959
<i>We have entered a spectacular</i>

<i>binary star system</i>

00:59.000 --> 01:00.792
<i>in the Kavis Alpha Sector</i>

01:00.834 --> 01:03.792
<i>on a most critical mission</i>

01:00.834 --> 01:03.792
<i>of astrophysical research.</i>

01:03.834 --> 01:06.500
<i>Our eminent guest,</i>

01:03.834 --> 01:06.500
<i>Dr. Paul Stubbs</i>

01:06.542 --> 01:10.083
<i>will attempt to study</i>

01:06.542 --> 01:10.083
<i>the decay of neutronium</i>

01:10.125 --> 01:12.125
<i>expelled</i>

01:10.125 --> 01:12.125
<i>at relativistic speeds</i>

01:12.166 --> 01:14.417

01:14.458 --> 01:18.041
<i>which will occur here</i>

01:14.458 --> 01:18.041
<i>in a matter of hours.</i>

01:19.083 --> 01:21.542
Ensign,

01:19.083 --> 01:21.542
our position?

01:21.583 --> 01:23.166
Approaching

01:21.583 --> 01:23.166
one million kilometers

01:23.208 --> 01:24.500
from the neutron star, sir.

01:24.542 --> 01:27.083
Slow to one-third

01:24.542 --> 01:27.083
impulse power.

01:32.375 --> 01:34.709
STUBBS:

01:32.375 --> 01:34.709
Spectacular, isn't it,

01:32.375 --> 01:34.709
my young friend?

01:34.750 --> 01:36.250
Yes, sir.

01:38.125 --> 01:41.291
Over and over again,

01:38.125 --> 01:41.291
the intense gravitational pull

01:41.333 --> 01:43.166
of the little neutron star

01:43.208 --> 01:46.250
sucks up the star material

01:43.208 --> 01:46.250
from the red giant

01:46.291 --> 01:49.375
and it builds up

01:46.291 --> 01:49.375
on the surface

01:46.291 --> 01:49.375
until it explodes

01:49.417 --> 01:52.959
every 196 years.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.041
Like clockwork.

01:56.083 --> 01:59.000
And it is but 18 hours away.

01:59.041 --> 02:03.208
18 hours, seven minutes

01:59.041 --> 02:03.208
and... ten seconds, Doctor.

02:05.917 --> 02:11.667
The interstellar counterpart

02:05.917 --> 02:11.667
to Earth's Old Faithful.

02:11.709 --> 02:15.333
The only predictable burst

02:11.709 --> 02:15.333
of energy in the universe

02:15.375 --> 02:18.041
that can accomplish our goal.

02:20.083 --> 02:21.625
Doctor Stubbs,

02:20.083 --> 02:21.625
if you would like

02:21.667 --> 02:23.333
to make one final

02:21.667 --> 02:23.333
inspection of...

02:23.375 --> 02:28.792
Captain, I have been inspecting

02:23.375 --> 02:28.792
the Egg for the last 20 years.

02:28.834 --> 02:31.583
You may lay it when ready.

02:36.959 --> 02:38.959
Begin launch sequence.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.291
Shuttle Bay 2, stand by

02:39.000 --> 02:43.291
to launch... the Egg.

02:43.333 --> 02:45.583
Standing by, Commander.

02:45.625 --> 02:47.500
(<i> warning Klaxon sounds</i> )

02:55.500 --> 02:57.834
Five minutes to launch site.

03:01.875 --> 03:03.083

03:03.125 --> 03:04.917
The ship isn't responding, sir.

03:17.917 --> 03:20.875
Captain, we're heading

03:17.917 --> 03:20.875
straight into the path

03:17.917 --> 03:20.875

Initiating reverse sequence...

05:39.875 --> 05:41.166
now.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.667
Our momentum is

05:56.250 --> 05:57.667
still carrying us

05:57.709 --> 05:59.917
into the path

05:57.709 --> 05:59.917
of the stellar matter.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.500
12 seconds to impact, sir.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.458
Prepare for impact.

Medical personnel,

06:13.667 --> 06:15.917
report to the Bridge.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.166
Commander Data,

06:15.959 --> 06:18.166
check all systems.

explain control malfunction.

06:24.083 --> 06:28.125
No control malfunction

06:24.083 --> 06:28.125
has been recorded.

06:40.250 --> 06:41.875
Just lay down

06:40.250 --> 06:41.875
carefully.

06:41.917 --> 06:43.500
There you go.

06:49.417 --> 06:53.125
Doctor Stubbs, the Captain

06:49.417 --> 06:53.125
asked me to tell you

06:53.166 --> 06:54.458
that our systems

06:53.166 --> 06:54.458
are back to normal

06:54.500 --> 06:55.792
and we can try

06:54.500 --> 06:55.792
another launch attempt

06:55.834 --> 06:58.542
as soon

06:55.834 --> 06:58.542
as you're ready.

06:58.583 --> 07:00.875
Quite a dynamic family team--

07:00.917 --> 07:03.125
you Crushers.

07:03.166 --> 07:05.375
Well, it's nice

07:03.166 --> 07:05.375
to be together again.

07:05.417 --> 07:07.917
I was at Starfleet

07:05.417 --> 07:07.917
Medical for a year.

07:07.959 --> 07:09.083
I missed about...

07:09.125 --> 07:10.792
two inches of him.

07:10.834 --> 07:13.917
I'm not sure I'd want my mother

07:13.959 --> 07:16.792
to be flying through

07:13.959 --> 07:16.792
space with me.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.500
No, I take

07:16.834 --> 07:18.500
that back.

07:18.542 --> 07:19.834
I am sure.

07:19.875 --> 07:21.291
I wouldn't want her.

07:21.333 --> 07:22.875
My mother is

07:22.917 --> 07:26.125
a formidable

07:22.917 --> 07:26.125
woman, too.

07:26.166 --> 07:27.333
A woman of letters.

07:27.375 --> 07:29.083
A great critic.

07:29.125 --> 07:30.417
I know.

07:30.458 --> 07:32.208
Good lord, son.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.333
You didn't read

07:32.250 --> 07:34.333
that unauthorized biography?

07:34.375 --> 07:36.417
Is this all this

07:34.375 --> 07:36.417
boy does, Doctor--

07:36.458 --> 07:37.667
fly the ship and read?

07:37.709 --> 07:39.750
Doesn't he ever have any fun?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.917
Sure he does.

07:41.959 --> 07:45.542
Actually, most of my free time

07:41.959 --> 07:45.542
is taken up with my studies.

07:45.583 --> 07:48.000
I'm trying to get

07:45.583 --> 07:48.000
into Starfleet Academy.

07:48.041 --> 07:50.333
I earn credits for the time

07:48.041 --> 07:50.333
spent on the<i> Enterprise</i>

07:50.375 --> 07:52.417
but it's just not the same.

07:52.458 --> 07:53.709
You ready to sit up?

07:56.625 --> 07:58.583
Well.

07:58.625 --> 08:03.959
I am whole again.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.709
Thank you, Doctor.

08:06.750 --> 08:08.291
Come along, Wesley.

08:08.333 --> 08:12.417
Let's go see if Humpty-Dumpty

08:08.333 --> 08:12.417
is still in one piece.

08:13.792 --> 08:15.959
(<i> electronic humming</i> )

08:16.000 --> 08:18.667
(<i> liquid splashing</i> )

08:25.083 --> 08:27.291
Computer, fix the food slot.

08:27.333 --> 08:30.917
The food slot

08:27.333 --> 08:30.917
is functioning properly.

08:30.959 --> 08:33.125
Well, check again.

08:33.166 --> 08:36.375
The food slot

08:33.166 --> 08:36.375
is functioning properly.

08:36.417 --> 08:38.792
Computer, deactivate food slot.

08:44.208 --> 08:47.000
We're analyzing the engineering

08:44.208 --> 08:47.000
systems data, Captain.

08:47.041 --> 08:48.667
So far, we're showing

08:47.041 --> 08:48.667
nothing unusual

08:48.709 --> 08:51.125
in the computer log

08:48.709 --> 08:51.125
for that time period.

08:51.166 --> 08:52.959
Run a level-1 diagnostic series.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.041
(<i> door chimes</i> )

08:53.000 --> 08:55.041
Come.

08:55.083 --> 08:58.667
I, uh... I want a computer

08:55.083 --> 08:58.667
that's 100 percent

08:58.709 --> 09:00.709
to expedite

08:58.709 --> 09:00.709
Doctor Stubbs' experiment

09:00.750 --> 09:03.542
as well as the food slots

09:00.750 --> 09:03.542
in Sick Bay.

09:03.583 --> 09:04.542
Picard, out.

09:04.583 --> 09:06.125
Which seem

09:04.583 --> 09:06.125
to be working again.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.875
For the moment,

09:06.166 --> 09:07.875
anyway.

09:07.917 --> 09:10.250
What can I do

09:07.917 --> 09:10.250
for you, Doctor?

09:13.458 --> 09:18.750
Jean-Luc, how would you feel

09:13.458 --> 09:18.750
if you were a 17 year old

09:18.792 --> 09:20.500
and the only Starfleet officer

09:20.542 --> 09:22.417
whose mother was on board?

09:24.166 --> 09:26.875
Inhibited... I suppose.

09:26.917 --> 09:28.750
Mmm.

09:28.792 --> 09:30.625
But then I'm not Wesley.

09:30.667 --> 09:32.667
And if you are...

09:32.709 --> 09:34.458
concerned about him

09:34.500 --> 09:36.583
I see no evidence

09:34.500 --> 09:36.583
that there is a problem.

09:36.625 --> 09:41.500
I know, but in a funny way,

09:36.625 --> 09:41.500
that's exactly my point.

09:41.542 --> 09:42.500
We talk.

09:42.542 --> 09:43.500
We smile.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.959
It's almost too polite.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.583
Beverly, isn't it

09:45.000 --> 09:49.583
just a matter of time?

09:54.458 --> 09:57.542
I know how difficult it was

09:54.458 --> 09:57.542
for you being away.

10:04.375 --> 10:06.208
Tell me about him.

10:06.250 --> 10:10.417
Well, he's becoming

10:06.250 --> 10:10.417
a very fine officer.

10:10.458 --> 10:13.458
He works as hard

10:10.458 --> 10:13.458
as any member of the crew.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.250
Riker says his studies

10:13.500 --> 10:15.250
are on line...

10:15.291 --> 10:19.208
No, tell me about<i> him.</i>

10:21.000 --> 10:23.583
He's his father's son--

10:23.625 --> 10:25.917
honest

10:25.959 --> 10:27.417
trusting

10:27.458 --> 10:29.291
strong.

10:31.625 --> 10:34.458
Does he have many friends?

10:34.500 --> 10:36.959
Has he ever been in love?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.917
Um...

10:39.959 --> 10:43.166
Jean-Luc, I'm worried.

10:43.208 --> 10:45.458
He's come so far, so fast

10:45.500 --> 10:47.875
and since I've been back

10:47.917 --> 10:49.250
I don't feel...

10:49.291 --> 10:51.166
His dependence.

10:51.208 --> 10:54.208
Beverly, look, he's...

10:54.250 --> 10:57.041
he's 17 years old.

10:57.083 --> 10:59.959
What were you doing

10:57.083 --> 10:59.959
when you were 17?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.959
Probably getting into

11:00.000 --> 11:01.959
more trouble than Wesley

11:02.000 --> 11:03.250
I can assure you.

11:03.291 --> 11:04.500
So was I.

11:04.542 --> 11:07.250
Isn't<i> that</i> what 17's

11:04.542 --> 11:07.250
supposed to be?

11:16.208 --> 11:19.125
No cracks in the armor.

11:19.166 --> 11:20.917
We'll do just fine.

11:20.959 --> 11:23.375
How can you be so calm

11:20.959 --> 11:23.375
about this?

11:23.417 --> 11:25.166
If I were about to make

11:23.417 --> 11:25.166
this kind of breakthrough...

11:25.208 --> 11:27.458
I have never doubted

11:25.208 --> 11:27.458
for a moment

11:27.500 --> 11:29.959
that this day would come,

11:27.500 --> 11:29.959
Wesley.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.625
And I suspect that someday

11:30.000 --> 11:34.625
it will come for you, as well.

11:34.667 --> 11:39.583
I see a lot of me in you.

11:39.625 --> 11:43.375
In my youth, they

11:39.625 --> 11:43.375
called me a wunderkind.

11:43.417 --> 11:46.458
Do you understand

11:43.417 --> 11:46.458
wunderkind?

11:46.500 --> 11:49.834
It's German, isn't it?

11:49.875 --> 11:53.291
It means

11:49.875 --> 11:53.291
"wonder child."

11:53.333 --> 11:55.583
It is reserved

11:53.333 --> 11:55.583
for those of us

11:55.625 --> 11:57.875
who achieve

11:55.625 --> 11:57.875
early in life.

11:57.917 --> 12:01.375
Now the burden

11:57.917 --> 12:01.375
is yours.

12:01.417 --> 12:02.709
Burden?

12:02.750 --> 12:05.875
To fulfill

12:02.750 --> 12:05.875
your potential.

12:05.917 --> 12:07.875
You will never

12:05.917 --> 12:07.875
come up against

12:07.917 --> 12:10.792
a greater adversary

12:07.917 --> 12:10.792
than your own potential

12:10.834 --> 12:12.041
my young friend.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.375
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

12:13.417 --> 12:14.375
Red alert.

12:14.417 --> 12:15.792
Return to quarters

12:14.417 --> 12:15.792
immediately.

12:17.875 --> 12:19.417
Still no visual contact?

12:19.458 --> 12:21.834
That's impossible.

12:21.875 --> 12:25.208
Mr. Worf, same magnification

12:21.875 --> 12:25.208
50 degrees starboard.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.959
Worf, you're

12:30.625 --> 12:32.959
absolutely sure?

12:33.000 --> 12:36.291
Sensors clearly indicate

12:33.000 --> 12:36.291
the approach of a Borg vessel.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.417
Shields up.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.250
Shields are

12:38.458 --> 12:41.250
not responding.

12:41.291 --> 12:43.542
Manual override is jammed.

12:43.583 --> 12:46.208
It's not gonna work

12:43.583 --> 12:46.208
this time. We don't have

12:43.583 --> 12:46.208
the shields, Captain.

12:46.250 --> 12:48.375
Captain, they're firing

12:46.250 --> 12:48.375
energy weapons at us.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.375
Evasive action.

12:50.417 --> 12:52.083
Bring her around to 275,

12:50.417 --> 12:52.083
mark three.

12:52.125 --> 12:54.500
Predict current vector

12:52.125 --> 12:54.500
of Borg vessel.

12:54.542 --> 12:55.792
Vector...

12:58.083 --> 12:59.333
It's gone.

12:59.375 --> 13:01.291
And so is the Borg ship.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.959
You telling me this is

13:01.333 --> 13:03.959
another computer glitch?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.875
DATA:

13:04.000 --> 13:05.875
It is conceivable

13:04.000 --> 13:05.875
that he was viewing

13:05.917 --> 13:07.875
a synthetically generated image,

13:05.917 --> 13:07.875
sir.

13:07.917 --> 13:11.041
Then our computer

13:07.917 --> 13:11.041
was daydreaming?

13:12.250 --> 13:14.208
PICARD:

13:12.250 --> 13:14.208
Computer.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.458
Identify malfunction

13:14.250 --> 13:16.458
immediately.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.792
COMPUTER:

13:16.500 --> 13:18.792
Pawn to Bishop Four.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.834
Knight to King's Rook Three.

13:20.875 --> 13:23.041
Bishop to Queen's Bishop Four.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.500
Knight to Knight Five.

13:24.542 --> 13:25.917
Queen's Knight to...

13:25.959 --> 13:28.291
Controls are

13:25.959 --> 13:28.291
not responding, sir.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.041
Queen to Bishop Three.

13:30.083 --> 13:31.250
Bishop to Bishop Two.

13:31.291 --> 13:33.166
(<i> engines powering down</i> )

13:33.208 --> 13:34.792
Impulse engines are down.

13:34.834 --> 13:37.166
Try warp engines.

13:38.625 --> 13:40.375
Nope, sorry,

13:38.625 --> 13:40.375
Commander.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.291
I'd better get back

13:40.417 --> 13:42.291
to Engineering.

13:42.333 --> 13:45.875
Mr. La Forge

13:42.333 --> 13:45.875
I want Lieutenant Worf

13:42.333 --> 13:45.875
to accompany you.

13:45.917 --> 13:48.542
Get me a full report on

13:45.917 --> 13:48.542
the prospects of getting

13:45.917 --> 13:48.542
our shields back.

13:48.583 --> 13:53.041
Number One, Mr. Data, will

13:48.583 --> 13:53.041
you join me in the conference

13:48.583 --> 13:53.041
room as soon as possible?

13:53.083 --> 13:56.166
It's time to discuss

13:53.083 --> 13:56.166
the future of this mission...

13:56.208 --> 13:57.875
if there still is one.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.750
The fact of the matter is,

14:05.500 --> 14:07.750
we are dealing

14:07.792 --> 14:10.208
with the potential breakdown

14:07.792 --> 14:10.208
of the main computer.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.667
That's hard

14:10.250 --> 14:11.667
to accept.

14:11.709 --> 14:13.458
The system

14:11.709 --> 14:13.458
automatically provides

14:13.500 --> 14:15.125
for self-correction, Captain.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.834
There has not been a

14:15.166 --> 14:17.834
systems-wide technological

14:15.166 --> 14:17.834
failure

14:17.875 --> 14:19.917
on a Starship in 79 years.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.542
(<i> door opens</i> )

14:21.583 --> 14:23.041
Excuse me, Captain

14:23.083 --> 14:25.250
but Dr. Stubbs

14:23.083 --> 14:25.250
is waiting outside.

14:25.291 --> 14:29.709
Captain, I'm sure you have

14:25.291 --> 14:29.709
everything under control.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.542
I'd just like to know

14:29.750 --> 14:31.542
what's going on.

14:31.583 --> 14:32.542
Of course, Doctor.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.291
Sit down.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.125
Counselor.

14:37.375 --> 14:40.291
Commander La Forge

14:37.375 --> 14:40.291
is attempting repairs

14:40.333 --> 14:41.500
even as we speak.

14:41.542 --> 14:42.792
Attempting?

14:42.834 --> 14:45.542
That doesn't sound

14:42.834 --> 14:45.542
particularly reassuring.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.250
Doctor, if at all possible

14:47.291 --> 14:49.375
we will continue

14:47.291 --> 14:49.375
this mission as planned.

14:49.417 --> 14:53.208
Captain,

14:49.417 --> 14:53.208
if we miss our chance now

14:53.250 --> 14:56.083
we don't get another

14:53.250 --> 14:56.083
for two centuries.

14:56.125 --> 14:58.250
There will be many questions

14:56.125 --> 14:58.250
asked by Starfleet

14:58.291 --> 15:01.250
if the<i> Enterprise</i> fails

14:58.291 --> 15:01.250
in its duty.

15:01.291 --> 15:05.500
Hmm. Nevertheless, my first

15:01.291 --> 15:05.500
and foremost consideration

15:05.542 --> 15:09.083
will be to ensure the safety

15:05.542 --> 15:09.083
of this ship and its crew.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.542
Ensure the safety, Captain?

15:11.583 --> 15:15.667
Or are you really talking

15:11.583 --> 15:15.667
about playing it safe?

15:15.709 --> 15:19.875
My dear Doctor,

15:15.709 --> 15:19.875
in our current position

15:19.917 --> 15:21.625
when that star explodes,

15:19.917 --> 15:21.625
you will get

15:21.667 --> 15:24.542
to watch your experiment

15:21.667 --> 15:24.542
from the inside out.

15:24.583 --> 15:26.875
I would rather die than leave.

15:26.917 --> 15:30.250
I don't believe you speak

15:26.917 --> 15:30.250
for the majority of the crew.

15:30.291 --> 15:32.625
Dr. Stubbs

15:32.667 --> 15:35.041
I know

15:32.667 --> 15:35.041
how much this means to you...

15:35.083 --> 15:38.542
My dear Counselor,

15:35.083 --> 15:38.542
no insult intended

15:38.583 --> 15:42.000
but please turn off

15:38.583 --> 15:42.000
your beam into my soul.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.041
I will share

15:42.041 --> 15:44.041
the feelings

15:44.083 --> 15:45.875
I wish to share.

15:49.083 --> 15:54.417
Well, if we do not leave

15:49.083 --> 15:54.417
in time, so be it.

15:54.458 --> 15:58.291
It's one sure way into

15:54.458 --> 15:58.291
the record books, eh?

16:00.625 --> 16:03.542
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

16:03.583 --> 16:05.333
His nonchalance

16:05.375 --> 16:07.417
is studied and practiced.

16:07.458 --> 16:08.709
Mm-hmm.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.959
Even my sensory perception

16:08.750 --> 16:10.959
picked that up.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.917
He's put his entire self-worth

16:11.000 --> 16:14.917
on the line

16:14.959 --> 16:16.750
with this experiment.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.333
He's telling the truth

16:18.375 --> 16:20.500
when he says

16:18.375 --> 16:20.500
he'd rather die than leave.

16:24.542 --> 16:26.166
Call up the cross-section

16:26.208 --> 16:28.625
of computer core processor 451.

16:28.667 --> 16:31.917
I want to see elements

16:28.667 --> 16:31.917
0200 to 0300.

16:31.959 --> 16:33.083
Aye, sir.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.250
In order to get some power

16:34.291 --> 16:35.875
I had to bypass

16:34.291 --> 16:35.875
the computer core

16:35.917 --> 16:38.500
essentially hot-wire

16:35.917 --> 16:38.500
the connection.

16:38.542 --> 16:40.458
Whoa, whoa, right there.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.959
Look at that lesion.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.583
No wonder we're

16:42.000 --> 16:43.583
coming apart at the seams.

16:43.625 --> 16:46.125
It's definitely some kind

16:43.625 --> 16:46.125
of continuing disintegration

16:46.166 --> 16:49.458
but, from what,

16:46.166 --> 16:49.458
I can't tell you.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.000
And I haven't the slightest idea

16:49.500 --> 16:52.000
how to stop it.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.208
It's just a mechanical problem

16:52.041 --> 16:54.208
though, right?

16:54.250 --> 16:57.083
Increase magnification,

16:54.250 --> 16:57.083
factor 50.

16:57.125 --> 17:00.041
I don't know, Wes,

16:57.125 --> 17:00.041
but looking at it...

17:00.083 --> 17:02.208
You know, if I

17:00.083 --> 17:02.208
didn't know any better

17:02.250 --> 17:03.667
I'd say somebody

17:02.250 --> 17:03.667
had climbed in there

17:03.709 --> 17:05.875
and started

17:03.709 --> 17:05.875
taking it apart.

17:48.333 --> 17:51.125
Guinan.

17:51.166 --> 17:53.000
I didn't think

17:51.166 --> 17:53.000
anyone would be here.

17:53.041 --> 17:55.500
I've never been

17:53.041 --> 17:55.500
any good at being

17:53.041 --> 17:55.500
confined to quarters--

17:55.542 --> 17:58.417
as my husbands

17:55.542 --> 17:58.417
will attest to.

17:58.458 --> 17:59.709
What's that?

17:59.750 --> 18:04.458
I'm just setting traps.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.083
I run a clean place.

18:07.125 --> 18:08.083
I know.

18:08.125 --> 18:09.417
It's not that.

18:09.458 --> 18:12.750
It's...

18:12.792 --> 18:15.542
I'm scared, Guinan.

18:15.583 --> 18:18.083
I think that everything

18:15.583 --> 18:18.083
that's been going wrong

18:18.125 --> 18:19.375
might be my fault.

18:19.417 --> 18:22.333
You want to tell me about it?

18:22.375 --> 18:25.417
I've been working

18:22.375 --> 18:25.417
on my final project

18:25.458 --> 18:27.000
for advanced genetics.

18:27.041 --> 18:28.291
It's on nanotechnology.

18:28.333 --> 18:29.625
I've been studying the nanites

18:29.667 --> 18:31.959
we have in the Sick Bay

18:29.667 --> 18:31.959
genetics supplies.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.959
They're these little tiny robots

18:34.000 --> 18:36.500
with gigabytes

18:34.000 --> 18:36.500
of mechanical computer memory.

18:36.542 --> 18:38.709
They're designed

18:36.542 --> 18:38.709
to enter living cells

18:38.750 --> 18:41.000
and conduct repairs.

18:41.041 --> 18:44.125
They're supposed

18:41.041 --> 18:44.125
to remain confined to the lab.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.667
Are you saying

18:44.166 --> 18:46.667
there are nanites loose?

18:46.709 --> 18:49.333
Two of them, that's all.

18:49.375 --> 18:51.333
I just wanted to see

18:51.375 --> 18:53.291
how they would interact

18:51.375 --> 18:53.291
and function in tandem.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.208
See, in my experiment,

18:53.333 --> 18:56.208
I had proposed a theory

18:56.250 --> 18:58.917
that, by working together,

18:56.250 --> 18:58.917
they could combine their skills

18:58.959 --> 19:00.166
and increase their usefulness.

19:00.208 --> 19:01.625
It was working.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.667
So you made better nanites.

19:03.709 --> 19:07.500
I was pulling an all-nighter

19:03.709 --> 19:07.500
to collect my final data.

19:07.542 --> 19:09.333
I fell asleep

19:09.375 --> 19:12.834
and, when I woke up, I saw the

19:09.375 --> 19:12.834
container had been left open.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
It's just a science project.

19:17.041 --> 19:21.291
You know, a doctor friend

19:17.041 --> 19:21.291
once said the same thing to me.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.709
Frankenstein was his name.

19:23.750 --> 19:26.709
They're really harmless.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.583
I mean, they're equipped with

19:26.750 --> 19:29.583
only the most basic of skills.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.959
It's almost impossible

19:29.625 --> 19:31.959
they could be responsible.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.333
Almost.

19:33.375 --> 19:36.959
Dr. Crusher to Wesley Crusher.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.166
Go ahead.

19:38.208 --> 19:39.959
I stopped

19:38.208 --> 19:39.959
by your quarters, Wes.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.542
I assumed you'd be there

19:40.000 --> 19:42.542
since you're off duty.

19:42.583 --> 19:45.792
I know, I just had

19:42.583 --> 19:45.792
some things to do.

19:45.834 --> 19:48.583
Orders are orders, Mr. Crusher.

19:48.625 --> 19:50.875
On my way.

19:50.917 --> 19:53.959
You won't tell anybody,

19:50.917 --> 19:53.959
will you?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.583
I know--<i> I</i> will.

19:59.709 --> 20:02.750
If it's true.

20:02.792 --> 20:07.583
Wes, do you think you're going

20:02.792 --> 20:07.583
to get a good grade?

20:07.625 --> 20:10.291
I always get an "A."

20:13.208 --> 20:15.709
So did Doctor Frankenstein.

20:18.583 --> 20:20.166
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

20:20.208 --> 20:22.250
<i>Our computer core</i>

20:20.208 --> 20:22.250

20:22.291 --> 20:23.583
<i>and yet there is no sign</i>

20:23.625 --> 20:25.375
<i>of a breach of security</i>

20:23.625 --> 20:25.375

20:25.417 --> 20:26.875

20:26.917 --> 20:28.875

20:26.917 --> 20:28.875

20:28.917 --> 20:30.583
<i>But without a reliable computer</i>

20:30.625 --> 20:33.917
<i>Dr. Stubbs' experiment</i>

20:30.625 --> 20:33.917

20:33.959 --> 20:35.750
Manual restart sequence.

20:35.792 --> 20:38.166
LA FORGE:

20:35.792 --> 20:38.166
Manual restart successful.

20:38.208 --> 20:39.792
Impulse engine functions

20:38.208 --> 20:39.792
all appear normal.

20:39.834 --> 20:40.959
Proceed.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.333
Shuttle Bay 2,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.333
open hangar door.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.375
Aye, sir.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.875
(<i> warning Klaxon sounds</i> )

20:45.917 --> 20:49.000
The door did not respond.

20:45.917 --> 20:49.000
Repeating sequence.

20:49.041 --> 20:54.041
(<i> "Stars and Stripes Forever"</i>

20:49.041 --> 20:54.041
<i>plays loudly</i> )

20:54.083 --> 20:56.583
What in heaven's name...?

20:56.625 --> 20:59.083
DATA:

20:56.625 --> 20:59.083
It is "Stars and

20:56.625 --> 20:59.083
Stripes Forever," sir

20:59.125 --> 21:00.375
by John Philip Sousa

21:00.417 --> 21:02.250
an American composer

21:00.417 --> 21:02.250
of band music

21:02.291 --> 21:04.375
in the early 20th century...

21:02.291 --> 21:04.375
PICARD:

21:02.291 --> 21:04.375
Yes, yes

21:04.417 --> 21:06.875
I know that.

21:04.417 --> 21:06.875
Computer,

21:04.417 --> 21:06.875
shut off the music.

21:06.917 --> 21:10.375
Music is on all

21:06.917 --> 21:10.375
communications channels, sir.

21:10.417 --> 21:12.583
Weapons, power,

21:10.417 --> 21:12.583
communications--

21:12.625 --> 21:14.583
we're being stripped

21:12.625 --> 21:14.583
one system at a time.

21:14.625 --> 21:17.291
Shut off the power

21:14.625 --> 21:17.291
to the Bridge.

21:17.333 --> 21:20.500
(<i> music stops</i> )

21:20.542 --> 21:22.083
Commander La Forge

21:22.125 --> 21:24.458
can you get us

21:22.125 --> 21:24.458
out of this star system safely?

21:24.500 --> 21:26.333
No!

21:26.375 --> 21:27.291
Not now, Doctor.

21:27.333 --> 21:28.458
LA FORGE:

21:27.333 --> 21:28.458
I'll try, Captain.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.625
I don't want to overload

21:28.500 --> 21:30.625
the engines.

21:30.667 --> 21:31.750
Do it gently.

21:31.792 --> 21:33.000
But do it.

21:34.750 --> 21:36.750
We'll circuit in auxiliary power

21:34.750 --> 21:36.750
to the Bridge.

21:36.792 --> 21:39.417
Somehow, we'll silence Sousa

21:36.792 --> 21:39.417
if he decides to play an encore.

21:39.458 --> 21:43.208
The priority is to find out

21:39.458 --> 21:43.208
who or what is doing this.

21:43.250 --> 21:48.166
Number One, the Bridge,

21:43.250 --> 21:48.166
such as it is, is yours.

21:55.875 --> 21:58.625
The Egg that

21:55.875 --> 21:58.625
Stubbs laid.

21:58.667 --> 22:01.458
No one will say that.

22:01.500 --> 22:05.333
Nobody will say

22:01.500 --> 22:05.333
anything at all, Wesley.

22:05.375 --> 22:09.458
We will not even

22:05.375 --> 22:09.458
be mentioned.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.458
I could live

22:09.500 --> 22:12.458
with failure...

22:12.500 --> 22:14.583
Well, maybe not.

22:14.625 --> 22:19.458
But never even to try,

22:14.625 --> 22:19.458
to miss your one chance at bat.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.875
Do you know baseball?

22:20.917 --> 22:23.792
Yes, my father taught it to me

22:20.917 --> 22:23.792
when I was young.

22:23.834 --> 22:27.583
Once, centuries ago,

22:23.834 --> 22:27.583
it was the beloved

22:27.625 --> 22:30.750
national pastime

22:27.625 --> 22:30.750
of the Americas, Wesley.

22:30.792 --> 22:32.667
Abandoned by a society

22:32.709 --> 22:36.542
that prized fast food

22:32.709 --> 22:36.542
and faster games.

22:36.583 --> 22:40.166
Lost to impatience.

22:40.208 --> 22:42.875
But I have seen

22:42.917 --> 22:46.000
the great players

22:42.917 --> 22:46.000
make the great plays.

22:46.041 --> 22:48.125
Do you recreate them

22:46.041 --> 22:48.125
on a holodeck?

22:48.166 --> 22:50.875
No...

22:50.917 --> 22:52.542
in here.

22:52.583 --> 22:55.709
With the knowledge

22:52.583 --> 22:55.709
of statistics--

22:55.750 --> 22:59.709
runs, hits and errors

22:59.750 --> 23:04.208
times at bat, box scores.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.208
Men like us do not need

23:06.250 --> 23:09.166
holodecks, Wesley.

23:09.208 --> 23:13.959
I have played seasons

23:09.208 --> 23:13.959
in my mind.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.458
It was my reward to myself

23:16.500 --> 23:19.041
for patience.

23:19.083 --> 23:23.083
Knowing my turn would come.

23:23.125 --> 23:26.083
Call your shot.

23:26.125 --> 23:29.500
Point to a star.

23:29.542 --> 23:32.625
One great blast

23:32.667 --> 23:36.375
and the crowd rises.

23:36.417 --> 23:41.917
A brand-new era in astrophysics

23:41.959 --> 23:46.291
postponed 196 years...

23:48.208 --> 23:50.875
on account of rain.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.500
(<i> beeping short beeps</i> )

24:03.083 --> 24:04.709
(<i> beeping short beeps</i> )

24:10.250 --> 24:12.709
(<i> long beeps</i> )

24:27.625 --> 24:30.875
We have to talk.

24:30.917 --> 24:34.083
You really look

24:30.917 --> 24:34.083
like you could use

24:30.917 --> 24:34.083
some rest, Wesley.

24:34.125 --> 24:36.834
I know.

24:36.875 --> 24:38.542
It's okay, really.

24:38.583 --> 24:42.208
No, it's not okay.

24:42.250 --> 24:43.583
Really.

24:43.625 --> 24:45.166
Look, Mom

24:45.208 --> 24:46.959
I'm just checking

24:45.208 --> 24:46.959
some traps that I set

24:47.000 --> 24:48.667
to see if I can find out

24:47.000 --> 24:48.667
what's happening

24:48.709 --> 24:49.834
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

24:49.875 --> 24:51.250
On someone's orders?

24:51.291 --> 24:54.166
We're running out of time

24:51.291 --> 24:54.166
for Dr. Stubbs.

24:54.208 --> 24:56.667
You can't put everything on

24:54.208 --> 24:56.667
your shoulders, Wesley.

24:56.709 --> 24:58.500
Even when you're off duty,

24:56.709 --> 24:58.500
you're on duty.

24:58.542 --> 25:01.041
Mom, you don't understand.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.834
You are a 17 year old.

25:02.875 --> 25:06.750
I am also an acting officer

25:02.875 --> 25:06.750
and I have responsibilities.

25:06.792 --> 25:09.959
I'm beginning to think

25:10.000 --> 25:12.834
maybe you've taken on

25:10.000 --> 25:12.834
too many responsibilities.

25:12.875 --> 25:14.792
Look, I have done everything

25:14.834 --> 25:16.709
that everyone has asked

25:14.834 --> 25:16.709
of me, and more.

25:16.750 --> 25:17.750
And how can you know?

25:17.792 --> 25:19.375
You haven't even been here.

25:27.792 --> 25:29.917
I'm here now, Wesley.

25:34.792 --> 25:38.208
Come on, I'll help you.

25:38.250 --> 25:39.792
What are you looking for?

25:44.834 --> 25:46.875
Wesley.

25:56.500 --> 25:59.166
I think I've made

25:56.500 --> 25:59.166
a horrible mistake.

26:02.667 --> 26:04.583
DR. CRUSHER:

26:02.667 --> 26:04.583
Nanites--

26:04.625 --> 26:06.917
tiny machines built

26:04.625 --> 26:06.917
from the atom up.

26:06.959 --> 26:08.417
Designed for exposure only

26:08.458 --> 26:11.250
to the inside of nuclei

26:08.458 --> 26:11.250
during cellular surgeries.

26:11.291 --> 26:12.333
Until then,

26:12.375 --> 26:14.041
they are kept

26:12.375 --> 26:14.041
tightly contained

26:14.083 --> 26:16.417
in a non-functioning state.

26:16.458 --> 26:18.542
These are not

26:16.458 --> 26:18.542
ordinary nanites.

26:18.583 --> 26:21.834
No, they have evolved.

26:21.875 --> 26:26.792
Evolved? How does

26:21.875 --> 26:26.792
a machine evolve?

26:26.834 --> 26:28.500
It's true.

26:28.542 --> 26:31.125
I am responsible

26:28.542 --> 26:31.125
for this.

26:31.166 --> 26:34.792
I allowed two

26:31.166 --> 26:34.792
of the nanites to interact

26:34.834 --> 26:35.959
for a school project.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.208
I wanted to increase

26:36.000 --> 26:38.208
their capabilities

26:38.250 --> 26:40.458
and they escaped.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.750
School project?

26:42.792 --> 26:45.625
Just how far have

26:42.792 --> 26:45.625
these things evolved?

26:45.667 --> 26:48.917
Well...

26:48.959 --> 26:50.375
this is a sample

26:50.417 --> 26:53.709
of linear memory crystal

26:50.417 --> 26:53.709
from our computer core.

27:04.083 --> 27:06.000
It's like candy to them.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.375
CRUSHER:

27:06.041 --> 27:07.375
As you can see,

27:06.041 --> 27:07.375
they're able

27:07.417 --> 27:09.458
to mechanically

27:07.417 --> 27:09.458
replicate themselves.

27:09.500 --> 27:12.834
It is conceivable

27:09.500 --> 27:12.834
that with each new generation

27:12.875 --> 27:14.667
they enhance

27:12.875 --> 27:14.667
their own design.

27:14.709 --> 27:16.917
The rate of evolution

27:14.709 --> 27:16.917
would be extraordinary.

27:16.959 --> 27:19.583
How many generations

27:16.959 --> 27:19.583
are we dealing with here?

27:21.500 --> 27:23.750
Engineering, display

27:23.792 --> 27:26.125
computer core

27:23.792 --> 27:26.125
processor 451

27:26.166 --> 27:28.208
element 0299.

27:29.458 --> 27:32.875
Increase magnification

27:29.458 --> 27:32.875
factor 1,000.

27:36.375 --> 27:39.375
Can it be possible they

27:36.375 --> 27:39.375
know what they're doing?

27:39.417 --> 27:41.041
Why would they attack us?

27:41.083 --> 27:43.166
Why does a mosquito

27:41.083 --> 27:43.166
bite your ear?

27:43.208 --> 27:44.709
And who cares?

27:44.750 --> 27:47.959
The answer is simple--

27:44.750 --> 27:47.959
call an exterminator.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.625
Dr. Stubbs,

27:48.000 --> 27:52.625
these nanites are now working

27:52.667 --> 27:55.041
with a new,

27:52.667 --> 27:55.041
collective intelligence.

27:55.083 --> 27:57.542
Operating

27:55.083 --> 27:57.542
together.

27:57.583 --> 28:00.166
Teaching each other new skills.

28:00.208 --> 28:01.750
Oh, really.

28:01.792 --> 28:04.333
I'm sorry,

28:01.792 --> 28:04.333
but this is nonsense.

28:04.375 --> 28:06.208
You can't have

28:04.375 --> 28:06.208
a civilization

28:06.250 --> 28:07.625
of computer

28:06.250 --> 28:07.625
chips.

28:07.667 --> 28:09.000
They're made

28:07.667 --> 28:09.000
in a plant

28:09.041 --> 28:10.542
in Dakar, Senegal.

28:10.583 --> 28:13.500
I've watched

28:10.583 --> 28:13.500
the construction.

28:13.542 --> 28:18.709
Then how do you explain

28:13.542 --> 28:18.709
what we've just seen here?

28:18.750 --> 28:21.333
It's no more mysterious

28:18.750 --> 28:21.333
than watching a strain

28:21.375 --> 28:24.208
of Leutscher virus

28:21.375 --> 28:24.208
reproduce itself.

28:24.250 --> 28:28.333
And that, at least,

28:24.250 --> 28:28.333
is a<i> bona fide</i> life-form.

28:28.375 --> 28:31.458
How many disease

28:28.375 --> 28:31.458
germs and viruses

28:31.500 --> 28:34.875
have you destroyed

28:31.500 --> 28:34.875
in your time, Dr. Crusher?

28:34.917 --> 28:36.792
Dr. Stubbs, I cannot exterminate

28:36.834 --> 28:39.750
something that may

28:36.834 --> 28:39.750
or may not be intelligent.

28:39.792 --> 28:41.166
My good Captain...

28:42.709 --> 28:44.125
There's still time.

28:44.166 --> 28:46.542
Ensign, will you work

28:44.166 --> 28:46.542
with Mr. Data

28:46.583 --> 28:49.542
to try to remove

28:46.583 --> 28:49.542
them safely?

28:49.583 --> 28:53.208
If things get worse,

28:49.583 --> 28:53.208
we'll use stronger measures.

29:13.208 --> 29:18.208
Gentlemen, I need a computer

29:13.208 --> 29:18.208
that is 100 percent

29:18.250 --> 29:19.834
in less than eight hours.

29:19.875 --> 29:23.166
And we still have core

29:19.875 --> 29:23.166
reconstruction to consider.

29:23.208 --> 29:25.250
We're trying

29:23.208 --> 29:25.250
low gamma bursts.

29:25.291 --> 29:27.333
We think it may slow down

29:25.291 --> 29:27.333
their productivity.

29:27.375 --> 29:29.542
Have you considered

29:27.375 --> 29:29.542
a high-level charge?

29:29.583 --> 29:32.667
High level gamma radiation

29:29.583 --> 29:32.667
will kill them, Doctor.

29:32.709 --> 29:35.125
I know.

29:37.291 --> 29:40.750
I can't get the story

29:37.291 --> 29:40.750
of Gulliver out of my head--

29:40.792 --> 29:43.375
overpowered by Lilliputians.

29:43.417 --> 29:45.417
How long do we have to wait?

29:45.458 --> 29:47.417
We can continue

29:45.458 --> 29:47.417
to bypass the part

29:47.458 --> 29:48.959
of the computer

29:47.458 --> 29:48.959
that's affected

29:49.000 --> 29:50.750
but if the nanites

29:49.000 --> 29:50.750
are spreading

29:50.792 --> 29:52.875
through the

29:50.792 --> 29:52.875
whole ship...

29:54.750 --> 30:00.792
(<i> gas hissing</i> )

30:00.834 --> 30:02.417
Do you smell a change in...?

30:02.458 --> 30:03.875
(<i> coughing</i> )

30:03.917 --> 30:05.083
What...?

30:10.917 --> 30:12.458
Picard to La Forge.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.709
We have an environmental

30:12.500 --> 30:14.709
system malfunction

30:14.750 --> 30:16.291
on the Bridge.

30:14.750 --> 30:16.291
Acknowledge.

30:14.750 --> 30:16.291
Aye, sir.

30:16.333 --> 30:18.458
Nitrogen oxide--

30:16.333 --> 30:18.458
toxic levels.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.625
LA FORGE:

30:18.500 --> 30:20.625
Working on it, Captain.

30:20.667 --> 30:22.542
(<i> Bridge crew coughing</i> )

30:27.750 --> 30:31.166
I've switched to manual control

30:27.750 --> 30:31.166
of the air handling system.

30:41.834 --> 30:43.500
Mr. Worf, report.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.333
He entered

30:43.542 --> 30:45.333
a computer access room

30:45.375 --> 30:47.250
and sterilized one

30:45.375 --> 30:47.250
of the processors

30:47.291 --> 30:48.542
with gamma radiation.

30:48.583 --> 30:50.500
DATA:

30:48.583 --> 30:50.500
The nanites in

30:48.583 --> 30:50.500
the upper core

30:50.542 --> 30:52.250
are all dead, Captain.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.458
You have no choice now.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.667
It is a matter of survival.

31:04.709 --> 31:07.500
Dr. Stubbs, if you were

31:04.709 --> 31:07.500
a member of my crew, I would...

31:07.542 --> 31:09.917
But I am not a member

31:07.542 --> 31:09.917
of your crew, sir.

31:09.959 --> 31:11.375
I am a representative

31:11.417 --> 31:13.792
of the highest command

31:11.417 --> 31:13.792
of the Federation

31:13.834 --> 31:17.625
which has directed you

31:13.834 --> 31:17.625
to perform my experiment.

31:17.667 --> 31:20.625
If any man, woman or child

31:17.667 --> 31:20.625
on this ship

31:20.667 --> 31:23.417
is harmed as a result

31:20.667 --> 31:23.417
of your experiment

31:23.458 --> 31:24.792
I will have your head

31:24.834 --> 31:27.458
before the highest command

31:24.834 --> 31:27.458
in the Federation.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.125
Good lord.

31:29.166 --> 31:33.041
You are talking about machines

31:29.166 --> 31:33.041
with a screw loose.

31:33.083 --> 31:35.709
Simply turn them off

31:33.083 --> 31:35.709
and be done with them.

31:35.750 --> 31:37.458
DATA:

31:35.750 --> 31:37.458
Dr. Stubbs

31:37.500 --> 31:41.250
your own actions have provided

31:37.500 --> 31:41.250
evidence to the contrary.

31:41.291 --> 31:43.834
When you destroyed

31:41.291 --> 31:43.834
the nanites in the core

31:43.875 --> 31:47.125
they responded by interfering

31:43.875 --> 31:47.125
with our life-support systems.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.750
It is difficult to accept these

31:47.166 --> 31:49.750
as random actions

31:49.792 --> 31:51.875
by machines with loose screws.

31:51.917 --> 31:54.709
In effect, you may have proven

31:51.917 --> 31:54.709
that the nanites

31:54.750 --> 31:56.583
do have

31:54.750 --> 31:56.583
a collective intelligence.

31:56.625 --> 32:00.125
Captain, the ship

31:56.625 --> 32:00.125
is at risk.

32:00.166 --> 32:03.166
Extermination may be

32:00.166 --> 32:03.166
our only alternative.

32:03.208 --> 32:05.083
Good point.

32:05.125 --> 32:07.208
Lieutenant Worf,

32:05.125 --> 32:07.208
I want Dr. Stubbs

32:07.250 --> 32:09.417
confined to his quarters

32:07.250 --> 32:09.417
until further notice.

32:20.750 --> 32:24.166
Mr. Data, can you

32:20.750 --> 32:24.166
find me some way

32:24.208 --> 32:26.792
to communicate

32:24.208 --> 32:26.792
with these things?

32:26.834 --> 32:31.208
With intelligence, there is

32:26.834 --> 32:31.208
the capability of language

32:31.250 --> 32:32.333
but it will depend

32:31.250 --> 32:32.333
on how far

32:32.375 --> 32:34.250
their evolution

32:32.375 --> 32:34.250
has brought them.

32:34.291 --> 32:37.959
We could modify the

32:34.291 --> 32:37.959
circuitry in the

32:34.291 --> 32:37.959
universal translator

32:38.000 --> 32:40.709
to make it capable of

32:38.000 --> 32:40.709
communications with them.

32:41.875 --> 32:43.792
Proceed.

32:54.041 --> 32:55.291
(<i> door chimes</i> )

32:59.166 --> 33:02.083
May I come in?

33:02.125 --> 33:05.458
You just can't resist,

33:02.125 --> 33:05.458
can you, Counselor?

33:07.542 --> 33:10.083
I only want to help.

33:10.125 --> 33:12.792
Yes, yes--

33:12.834 --> 33:14.792
to break the shell

33:14.834 --> 33:18.583
to get in touch

33:14.834 --> 33:18.583
with my true feelings.

33:18.625 --> 33:22.917
I'm only worried about

33:18.625 --> 33:22.917
your state of mind, Doctor.

33:22.959 --> 33:26.125
All right, Counselor.

33:26.166 --> 33:29.083
What is it

33:26.166 --> 33:29.083
that has you so worried?

33:29.125 --> 33:31.083
Your single-mindedness.

33:31.125 --> 33:33.917
Your need to have

33:31.125 --> 33:33.917
this experiment work.

33:33.959 --> 33:35.834
But it will.

33:35.875 --> 33:37.291
Picard has no choice now.

33:37.333 --> 33:40.375
He must defend

33:37.333 --> 33:40.375
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

33:43.875 --> 33:47.792
Counselor,

33:43.875 --> 33:47.792
when this is all over

33:47.834 --> 33:49.709
I will show you New Manhattan

33:49.750 --> 33:52.834
on Beth Delta I, as you

33:49.750 --> 33:52.834
have never seen it

33:52.875 --> 33:56.166
and we will laugh

33:52.875 --> 33:56.166
over glasses of champagne.

33:56.208 --> 34:01.458
Your self-portrait

33:56.208 --> 34:01.458
is so practiced, so polished.

34:01.500 --> 34:05.000
Yes, isn't it, though?

34:05.041 --> 34:08.458
It's stretched so tight

34:05.041 --> 34:08.458
the tension fills this room.

34:08.500 --> 34:12.125
And if you

34:08.500 --> 34:12.125
finally fail

34:12.166 --> 34:15.417
I fear it will snap.

34:17.792 --> 34:19.875
A good try, Counselor.

34:24.125 --> 34:26.792
But sometimes

34:26.834 --> 34:29.709
when you reach beneath

34:26.834 --> 34:29.709
a man's self-portrait--

34:29.750 --> 34:32.208
as you so eloquently put it--

34:32.250 --> 34:36.250
deep down inside,

34:32.250 --> 34:36.250
what you find...

34:36.291 --> 34:38.875
is nothing at all.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.834
Lockman on first.

35:14.875 --> 35:17.250
Dark on second.

35:17.291 --> 35:20.291
Thompson at the plate.

35:20.333 --> 35:22.166
Branca on the mound...

35:22.208 --> 35:23.959
(<i> sounds of crowded stadium</i> )

35:24.000 --> 35:25.208
(<i> crack of a hit</i> )

35:25.250 --> 35:29.458
(<i> crowd cheering</i> )

35:29.500 --> 35:31.041
(<i> electronic zapping</i> )

35:32.625 --> 35:33.875
(<i> zapping</i> )

35:34.875 --> 35:36.458
(<i> zapping</i> )

35:41.417 --> 35:44.458
(<i> equipment powering down</i> )

35:48.709 --> 35:50.959
(<i> screams</i> )

35:51.000 --> 35:53.667
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

36:09.000 --> 36:10.542
He's coming around.

36:10.583 --> 36:13.792
I cannot believe

36:10.583 --> 36:13.792
this was an arbitrary attack.

36:13.834 --> 36:16.375
Has Data made any progress

36:13.834 --> 36:16.375
in contacting them?

36:16.417 --> 36:19.291
Picard...

36:19.333 --> 36:22.959
you must protect me.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.083
Kill them.

36:37.709 --> 36:39.583
Commander Riker

36:39.625 --> 36:42.041
on my signal, we

36:39.625 --> 36:42.041
will gamma irradiate

36:42.083 --> 36:44.250
all the computer systems

36:42.083 --> 36:44.250
throughout the<i> Enterprise.</i>

36:44.291 --> 36:48.041
Let's put an end

36:44.291 --> 36:48.041
to this conflict.

36:48.083 --> 36:52.667
Worf, prepare to activate

36:48.083 --> 36:52.667
gamma pulse generators.

36:52.709 --> 36:54.500
(<i> beeping</i> )

36:54.542 --> 36:57.291
Electromagnetic scanners

36:54.542 --> 36:57.291
ready, Captain.

37:01.500 --> 37:02.917
Captain.

37:12.417 --> 37:15.458
I have established contact.

37:24.667 --> 37:26.041
As we continue, Captain

37:24.667 --> 37:26.041
they are virtually

37:26.083 --> 37:28.250
learning the concept

37:26.083 --> 37:28.250
of communication.

37:28.291 --> 37:31.667
Each new generation

37:28.291 --> 37:31.667
is making modifications.

37:31.709 --> 37:32.959
Can we actually

37:31.709 --> 37:32.959
talk to them, yet?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.875
I believe it is worth

37:33.000 --> 37:34.875
an attempt, sir.

37:36.500 --> 37:40.291
Commander Riker,

37:36.500 --> 37:40.291
bring Dr. Stubbs to the Bridge.

37:42.375 --> 37:45.500
I don't think

37:42.375 --> 37:45.500
this is a wise idea.

37:45.542 --> 37:47.875
They have already

37:45.542 --> 37:47.875
tried to kill me once.

37:47.917 --> 37:50.750
One sure way into the

37:47.917 --> 37:50.750
record books, Doctor.

37:54.917 --> 37:56.208
DATA:

37:54.917 --> 37:56.208
I am ready, sir.

37:56.250 --> 37:57.375
PICARD:

37:56.250 --> 37:57.375
Tell them that the human

37:57.417 --> 37:59.208
who destroyed

37:57.417 --> 37:59.208
their comrades is here

37:59.250 --> 38:00.417
and wishes

37:59.250 --> 38:00.417
to address them.

38:00.458 --> 38:01.625
Captain, if I may...

38:01.667 --> 38:03.834
And you, sir, you will

38:01.667 --> 38:03.834
explain your error

38:03.875 --> 38:05.417
and apologize and pray

38:03.875 --> 38:05.417
that we can

38:05.458 --> 38:08.125
negotiate a peace

38:05.458 --> 38:08.125
we can all live with.

38:08.166 --> 38:09.542
Is that clear?

38:09.583 --> 38:13.542
Captain, if a face-to-face

38:09.583 --> 38:13.542
negotiation

38:13.583 --> 38:14.959
would be helpful

38:13.583 --> 38:14.959
I would like to

38:15.000 --> 38:16.959
volunteer myself

38:15.000 --> 38:16.959
as a conduit.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.709
Yourself, Data?

38:18.750 --> 38:21.583
I can easily furnish the nanites

38:18.750 --> 38:21.583
with a schematic design

38:21.625 --> 38:23.792
of my neurological structure.

38:23.834 --> 38:25.583
Entering my neural

38:23.834 --> 38:25.583
network would require

38:25.625 --> 38:27.542
no more than their

38:25.625 --> 38:27.542
most basic skills.

38:27.583 --> 38:29.959
That's what they

38:27.583 --> 38:29.959
were designed for.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.709
They could penetrate

38:30.000 --> 38:31.709
the molecular fabric

38:31.750 --> 38:34.917
of my hand-covering

38:31.750 --> 38:34.917
into my nerve circuitry

38:34.959 --> 38:37.583
and interface with

38:34.959 --> 38:37.583
my verbal program.

38:37.625 --> 38:40.291
If they have control

38:37.625 --> 38:40.291
of a Starfleet Commander

38:40.333 --> 38:42.291
they become

38:40.333 --> 38:42.291
an even greater threat.

38:42.333 --> 38:46.000
How can we be sure that we

38:42.333 --> 38:46.000
can get them out of you?

38:46.041 --> 38:47.959
It would be a

38:46.041 --> 38:47.959
considerable risk, sir

38:48.000 --> 38:51.250
but it would also represent

38:48.000 --> 38:51.250
a gesture of trust on our part.

38:51.291 --> 38:53.250
It could be an important step

38:51.291 --> 38:53.250
toward peace, sir.

38:53.291 --> 38:58.458
All right, Data,

38:53.291 --> 38:58.458
propose it to the nanites.

39:04.291 --> 39:06.166
The answer is yes.

39:12.458 --> 39:14.542
They are ready, Captain.

39:15.667 --> 39:17.500
Proceed.

39:49.208 --> 39:51.792
<i>You are very...</i>

39:51.834 --> 39:56.250
<i>strange... looking creatures.</i>

39:56.291 --> 39:57.542
In our travels

39:57.583 --> 40:00.000
we have encountered

39:57.583 --> 40:00.000
many other creatures

40:00.041 --> 40:03.000
perhaps even stranger-

40:00.041 --> 40:03.000
looking than ourselves

40:03.041 --> 40:05.917
but we try to coexist

40:03.041 --> 40:05.917
peacefully with them.

40:05.959 --> 40:07.709
<i>Why did you attack us?</i>

40:07.750 --> 40:10.000
We misinterpreted

40:07.750 --> 40:10.000
your actions

40:10.041 --> 40:12.417
as an attack on us.

40:12.458 --> 40:14.375
<i>We were...</i>

40:14.417 --> 40:17.041
<i>seeking raw materials</i>

40:17.083 --> 40:20.041
<i>for our replicating process.</i>

40:20.083 --> 40:21.792
Yes, but you

40:20.083 --> 40:21.792
endangered this vessel

40:21.834 --> 40:22.959
in which we all travel.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.125
You nearly killed

40:23.000 --> 40:25.125
a crew member.

40:25.166 --> 40:27.291
<i>We meant no harm.</i>

40:27.333 --> 40:29.375
<i>We were...</i>

40:30.875 --> 40:33.667
<i>exploring.</i>

40:33.709 --> 40:35.500
I understand.

40:35.542 --> 40:38.625
We are also explorers.

40:38.667 --> 40:43.375
We mean no harm

40:38.667 --> 40:43.375
to any other living creature.

40:46.291 --> 40:48.583
I am the one responsible

40:48.625 --> 40:51.417
for the deaths

40:48.625 --> 40:51.417
in the computer core.

40:51.458 --> 40:53.208
<i>We know...</i>

40:53.250 --> 40:55.875
<i>who you are.</i>

40:55.917 --> 40:59.917
I deeply regret

40:55.917 --> 40:59.917
the incident.

40:59.959 --> 41:03.083
I am a scientist on

40:59.959 --> 41:03.083
an important mission.

41:03.125 --> 41:06.208
Your colleagues'

41:03.125 --> 41:06.208
exploration of

41:03.125 --> 41:06.208
the memory core

41:06.250 --> 41:07.667
put our mission at risk.

41:07.709 --> 41:09.709
I was only trying

41:07.709 --> 41:09.709
to protect

41:09.750 --> 41:14.792
a lifetime of work

41:09.750 --> 41:14.792
from being destroyed.

41:14.834 --> 41:17.542
I am at your mercy.

41:17.583 --> 41:20.709
<i>What is "at your mercy"?</i>

41:20.750 --> 41:23.667
He asks

41:20.750 --> 41:23.667
your forgiveness.

41:23.709 --> 41:28.333
This conflict was started

41:23.709 --> 41:28.333
by mistakes on both sides.

41:28.375 --> 41:31.834
Let's agree to end it

41:28.375 --> 41:31.834
here and now.

41:31.875 --> 41:33.208
<i>We...</i>

41:35.458 --> 41:37.542
<i>agree.</i>

41:39.917 --> 41:43.542
I pledge we will

41:39.917 --> 41:43.542
do everything possible

41:43.583 --> 41:46.333
to assist your

41:43.583 --> 41:46.333
continued survival.

41:46.375 --> 41:48.208
<i>Thank you.</i>

41:48.250 --> 41:51.959
<i>But we have evolved</i>

41:48.250 --> 41:51.959
<i>beyond any need</i>

41:52.000 --> 41:54.375
<i>for your assistance.</i>

41:54.417 --> 41:59.458
<i>This ship is too confining.</i>

41:59.500 --> 42:03.750
<i>We require relocation.</i>

42:03.792 --> 42:05.709
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

42:05.750 --> 42:08.000
<i>Dr. Stubbs'</i>

42:05.750 --> 42:08.000
<i>has used his influence</i>

42:08.041 --> 42:09.834
<i>to have planet Kavis Alpha IV</i>

42:09.875 --> 42:13.750
<i>designated the new home</i>

42:09.875 --> 42:13.750
<i>of the nanite civilization.</i>

42:13.792 --> 42:16.709
<i>Commander Data's neural network</i>

42:13.792 --> 42:16.709
<i>has been vacated.</i>

42:16.750 --> 42:19.542
<i>He has been returned to us</i>

42:16.750 --> 42:19.542
<i>unharmed</i>

42:19.583 --> 42:21.333
<i>and with the help</i>

42:19.583 --> 42:21.333
<i>of the nanites</i>

42:21.375 --> 42:23.750
<i>our computer core</i>

42:21.375 --> 42:23.750
<i>has been reconstructed</i>

42:23.792 --> 42:26.291
<i>in time for the experiment.</i>

42:30.417 --> 42:33.250
Ten seconds to

42:30.417 --> 42:33.250
stellar blast, sir.

42:33.291 --> 42:36.125
We're at 40 million kilometers

42:33.291 --> 42:36.125
from the neutron star, sir.

42:36.166 --> 42:38.458
Hold your position.

42:59.166 --> 43:00.417
Doctor?

43:20.792 --> 43:23.959
Do you have

43:20.792 --> 43:23.959
any children, Guinan?

43:24.000 --> 43:25.291
A lot.

43:25.333 --> 43:28.000
Ever had any trouble

43:25.333 --> 43:28.000
relating to them?

43:28.041 --> 43:30.291
Just one.

43:30.333 --> 43:31.333
One?

43:31.375 --> 43:33.834
He wouldn't

43:31.375 --> 43:33.834
listen to anybody.

43:33.875 --> 43:36.500
Well, they all

43:33.875 --> 43:36.500
go through that.

43:36.542 --> 43:40.375
Not in a species

43:36.542 --> 43:40.375
of listeners.

43:40.417 --> 43:42.917
Did he grow out of it?

43:42.959 --> 43:44.792
It took several

43:42.959 --> 43:44.792
hundred years

43:44.834 --> 43:46.667
but I managed

43:44.834 --> 43:46.667
to bring him around.

43:46.709 --> 43:47.709
How?

43:47.750 --> 43:50.417
A mother shapes her child

43:50.458 --> 43:52.417
in ways

43:50.458 --> 43:52.417
she doesn't even realize.

43:52.458 --> 43:55.125
Sometimes just by listening.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.041
Cute couple.

44:03.667 --> 44:08.583
See? Now, that is healthy

44:03.667 --> 44:08.583
for a boy his age.

44:08.625 --> 44:11.000
I mean that as a doctor,

44:08.625 --> 44:11.000
not as just a mother.

44:11.041 --> 44:15.333
Ah, it is so good to see him

44:11.041 --> 44:15.333
having fun for a change

44:15.375 --> 44:17.750
with an attractive

44:15.375 --> 44:17.750
young woman

44:17.792 --> 44:19.959
who obviously

44:17.792 --> 44:19.959
looks at him

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
with extraordinary

44:22.041 --> 44:25.333
affection.

44:25.375 --> 44:27.875
What do you know

44:25.375 --> 44:27.875
about this girl?
