00:55.756 --> 00:59.260
BECKY: Mom, we're
watching "Shock Theater."

00:59.360 --> 01:01.662
Dad said it's really scary.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.964
Maybe we can turn off the
lights and burn some candles.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.704
You want the neighbors to
find out we're devil worshipers?

01:10.804 --> 01:13.574
Dad said I could
watch "Shock Theater."

01:13.674 --> 01:15.243
Oh, he did, did he?

01:15.343 --> 01:16.944
Me and my man are
going to get shocked.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.280
Over my dead body.

01:19.380 --> 01:22.250
Before the night is over
we'll be up to our necks

01:22.350 --> 01:24.152
in dead bodies.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.120
[evil laugh]

01:26.220 --> 01:28.489
DJ, you don't want to
watch all that scary stuff.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.923
That'd give you nightmares.

01:30.023 --> 01:30.824
No, it won't.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.326
Well, it'd give me nightmares.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.261
Hey, Day.

01:33.361 --> 01:34.395
We gonna work on
the boat tomorrow?

01:34.495 --> 01:35.463
You bet.

01:35.563 --> 01:36.597
I figure we can put
in a couple of ribs

01:36.697 --> 01:38.666
and get them sounded
down real good.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.369
Gee, I only wish you were
as interested in your homework

01:41.469 --> 01:43.103
as you are on working
on that damn boat.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.004
Hey!

01:44.104 --> 01:45.939
I do my homework.

01:46.039 --> 01:48.576
Get off my back!

01:48.676 --> 01:50.043
I've got dibs on the couch!

01:50.144 --> 01:51.879
You're not hogging all
the things, lard butt!

01:51.979 --> 01:54.315
Hey Deej, grab the salt!

01:54.415 --> 01:55.216
Hey you.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.116
Who me?

01:56.217 --> 01:57.918
Yeah.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.787
What you think you're
doing letting him stay up

01:59.887 --> 02:01.422
late to watch all this trash?

02:01.522 --> 02:05.025
Honey, this is classic trash.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.328
Besides, I wasn't that
much older than the lad

02:07.428 --> 02:08.829
there when I saw
my first shocker.

02:08.929 --> 02:12.200
Yeah and look what
happened to you.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.534
Knock it off, Count.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.068
Besides, I'm going to
be sitting next to him

02:15.169 --> 02:16.069
the whole time.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.205
He's probably going
to fall asleep

02:17.305 --> 02:19.473
before the first
commercial, anyway.

02:19.573 --> 02:20.674
What are you worried about?

02:20.774 --> 02:22.075
I'm worried he's going
to be sleeping between us

02:22.176 --> 02:23.611
for the next two weeks.

02:23.711 --> 02:24.645
It's starting, Dad!

02:24.745 --> 02:26.514
Come on, we need you!

02:29.717 --> 02:30.518
DJ, wake up.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.019
It's starting.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.421
Now, come on, Dan.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.123
We're missing a chance to give
this family a dose of culture.

02:36.224 --> 02:37.024
Sorry, babe.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.760
Kids want vampires.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.094
Mob rules.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.597
Well, instead of watching
"The Thing That Wouldn't Die"

02:43.697 --> 02:45.533
on the thing that
wouldn't die, why don't

02:45.633 --> 02:47.167
we all do something together?

02:47.268 --> 02:49.337
We are doing
something together.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.539
I wonder what people
did before television.

02:51.639 --> 02:56.677
They made dolls out of
corncobs and stared at fire.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.079
[music playing]

03:02.583 --> 03:03.451
Mom?

03:03.551 --> 03:05.586
What's the matter?

03:05.686 --> 03:07.888
I don't feel so good.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.857
What's wrong?

03:09.957 --> 03:12.460
I dunno.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.362
Do you have a headache?

03:14.462 --> 03:15.329
No.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.732
Do you have a stomachache?

03:18.832 --> 03:20.701
No.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.970
You're worried about
making the mortgage payment?

03:25.973 --> 03:26.774
No.

03:29.076 --> 03:29.877
Come here.

03:41.989 --> 03:45.192
Well, you don't have a
fever, so I guess you're not

03:45.293 --> 03:47.261
going to perish in the night.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.630
I just can't
get back to sleep.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.033
Did you have a nightmare?

03:53.133 --> 03:54.067
Maybe.

03:54.167 --> 03:57.705
Was it in
turn-of-the-century Vienna?

03:57.805 --> 03:59.707
No.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.241
What was it about?

04:01.342 --> 04:03.777
I can't remember.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.213
[sighs contentedly]

04:06.314 --> 04:10.351
Darlene, don't you think
you're a little old for this?

04:10.451 --> 04:12.052
I don't want to
go back to my room.

04:12.152 --> 04:13.987
Can't I stay here?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.656
Just for a little while?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.525
Just until I fall asleep!

04:17.625 --> 04:20.294
Oh, you don't want
to sleep here, honey.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.162
Trust me.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.997
Daddy doesn't even like
sharing the bed with me.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.135
Oh, I know.

04:28.235 --> 04:29.269
I'll get a better idea.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.472
Come on, I'll take you
back up to your room.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.580
Dan?

04:39.680 --> 04:42.249
Remember how you said you'd
be responsible for whatever

04:42.350 --> 04:43.216
happened tonight?

04:43.317 --> 04:44.318
(SLEEPILY) Uh-huh?

04:44.418 --> 04:45.786
Well, Darlene's up.

04:45.886 --> 04:49.423
She can't get back to
sleep, so all you got to do

04:49.523 --> 04:53.827
is take her back up to her
room, get her a drink of water,

04:53.927 --> 04:57.465
tuck her in, and make sure
she gets back to sleep.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.967
OK.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.569
OK, honey, come on.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.136
Let's go.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.873
I don't think I
can fall asleep.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.609
You want me to tell you the
story about how I met Daddy?

05:08.709 --> 05:09.577
That might do it.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.748
Can't I sleep on the couch?

05:14.848 --> 05:19.887
No, Darlene, your nightmare's
not going to come back.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.990
And even if it does, you
know where to find me.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.325
I'm in the book.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.760
I don't want to fall asleep.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.297
[sighs]

05:30.398 --> 05:33.000
Tell me what you
dreamt about, honey.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.603
You might feel better
if you talk about it.

05:35.703 --> 05:38.005
It was scary.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.107
Dreams are nothing
to be afraid of.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.876
It's just when you're sleep,
there's this part of your brain

05:42.976 --> 05:45.579
that just sits around
telling stories.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.480
You mean like Grandpa?

05:49.617 --> 05:52.853
Tell me what you dreamt.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.221
No, forget about it.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.624
I don't want to.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.427
Are you OK, honey?

05:59.527 --> 06:00.327
I guess.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.532
Sure you are.

06:04.632 --> 06:05.566
[kiss]

06:05.666 --> 06:07.300
You just lay here
and close your eyes,

06:07.401 --> 06:09.970
and you'll be asleep in no time.

06:10.070 --> 06:10.938
Mom!

06:11.038 --> 06:13.407
What?

06:13.507 --> 06:15.108
Nothing.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.612
Do you want me to stay
here with you for a while?

06:18.712 --> 06:19.747
OK, move over.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.318
OK, lift up your head here.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.286
Close your eyes.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.192
Give me this damn thing.

06:36.363 --> 06:41.802
OK, so it was the
spring of 1971.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.704
And I'm coming out of
school, and there's

06:43.804 --> 06:47.508
just like really great looking
guy standing there, you know.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.877
And he's wearing this
really cool varsity jacket

06:49.977 --> 06:53.947
and everything, and he's cussing
out his motorcycle, you know,

06:54.047 --> 06:56.484
because it wouldn't start.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.486
So I go over there and--

07:00.721 --> 07:01.522
Darlene?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.562
Then what happened?

07:08.662 --> 07:09.463
Nothing!

07:09.563 --> 07:10.998
Go back to sleep!

07:13.834 --> 07:16.570
Do you know what the
absolute most grossening

07:16.670 --> 07:18.739
part of the movie was?

07:18.839 --> 07:22.275
No, but I got a feeling
I'm going to find out.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.645
Definitely when
the vampire threw up

07:24.745 --> 07:27.681
after eating the judge.
- I'm trying to eat breakfast!

07:27.781 --> 07:30.217
Would you shut up
about the stupid movie?

07:30.317 --> 07:31.685
What is your problem?

07:31.785 --> 07:34.655
Your face!

07:34.755 --> 07:35.823
What's with her?

07:35.923 --> 07:37.357
She had a rough night.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.760
Whoo, great morning, huh?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.228
Muah.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.664
Shut up.

07:43.764 --> 07:46.534
I can't wait for Aunt Jackie
to get here to do my hair.

07:46.634 --> 07:47.568
Can I watch?

07:47.668 --> 07:50.070
Just stay out of the way.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.238
You're still in
your nightgown.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.206
I'm waiting to go to sleep.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.508
Didn't you sleep last night?

07:54.608 --> 07:55.442
No.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.044
Well, I slept great.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.145
I bet you did.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.614
You had that great big
bed all to yourself.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.815
Where were you?

08:01.915 --> 08:04.552
I was upstairs, ghostbusting.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.688
Aw, babe, you should
have woke me up.

08:07.788 --> 08:11.458
Now, why didn't
I think of that?

08:11.559 --> 08:13.126
DJ have a nightmare?

08:13.226 --> 08:14.127
I don't know.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.429
I was too busy dealing
with Darlene's.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.566
Darlene had a nightmare.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.301
That's what she said, but it
just seems like something else

08:21.401 --> 08:22.469
is going on.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.137
Well, why does it have
to be something else?

08:24.237 --> 08:25.573
I mean, kids have nightmares.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.976
Yeah, and I bet watching
"Schlock Theater" didn't help.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.712
Hey, I once had a nightmare
for an entire month.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.113
It was the single
most frightening ex--

08:33.213 --> 08:35.949
God, when I think
of it, even now.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.752
I used to have this cup,
and on the side of the cup

08:38.852 --> 08:40.588
was a decal of an airplane.

08:40.688 --> 08:44.157
And every time I started to
take a drink, the top of the cup

08:44.257 --> 08:49.797
would touch my nose, and the
propellers would start up.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.899
And the airplane'd get going.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.000
And I swear this is true.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.067
It flew right up my nose.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.711
You're scary.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.545
Well, I know it doesn't
sound like much now,

09:05.646 --> 09:09.149
but you didn't see the
size of the propellers.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.920
Hey, Dan, this is no ordinary
airplane-up-the-nose nightmare.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.554
This is Darlene.

09:14.655 --> 09:15.856
When was the last
time she didn't

09:15.956 --> 09:17.691
make it through the night?

09:17.791 --> 09:20.560
And she refused to
go back to sleep.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.495
I was up there all
night with her.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.797
Hey, big D.

09:23.897 --> 09:24.732
Hey, Dad.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.133
What time's your
basketball game?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.034
1:30.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.235
Great!

09:28.335 --> 09:29.737
We can put in a couple of
hours on the boat first.

09:29.837 --> 09:30.638
BECKY (IN OTHER ROOM): DJ!

09:30.738 --> 09:32.439
They're not in there!

09:32.539 --> 09:34.541
I don't want to work
on the boat today.

09:34.642 --> 09:35.776
OK, Dad.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.110
Mom?
- Yeah, honey?

09:37.210 --> 09:38.011
I--

09:38.111 --> 09:39.379
BECKY (IN OTHER ROOM): DJ!

09:39.479 --> 09:42.049
Hey, baby, I can't fit a rib
without my master carpenter.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.917
Not today, OK Dad!

09:44.017 --> 09:44.852
Mom?

09:44.952 --> 09:46.253
What, honey?

09:46.353 --> 09:48.889
Mother, will you tell
DJ to stop bothering me?

09:48.989 --> 09:51.458
He's spilled my makeup
all over the bathroom.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.060
Yeah, I'll be
there in a minute.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.028
No, Mother, now.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.030
I got to get ready
for my date tonight.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.799
Mom, this is very important!

09:58.899 --> 10:01.935
Oh, honey, I'll be
right back in a minute.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.370
Honey, listen to
your weather-beaten

10:03.470 --> 10:06.239
old skipper of a father.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.475
Nightmares can
really depress you.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.577
I know, because
when I was a kid--

10:10.678 --> 10:13.881
and I shudder even
thinking of this now--

10:13.981 --> 10:16.116
I had a recurring nightmare.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.618
And it happened
in broad daylight.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.921
The most terrifying dreams
can happen during the daytime,

10:21.021 --> 10:22.389
did you know that?

10:22.489 --> 10:24.524
It's because they're so real.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.425
This one was a beaut.

10:25.525 --> 10:26.727
I used to have this little cup--

10:26.827 --> 10:28.395
And an airplane
flew up his nose.

10:28.495 --> 10:31.665
You don't want to hear.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.100
I was just trying to
explain to the child

10:33.200 --> 10:35.736
that I know how terrifying
nightmares can be.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.105
Can everybody shut
up about nightmares?

10:38.205 --> 10:39.740
I didn't have a nightmare!

10:39.840 --> 10:42.109
Well, then why did you
have trouble going to sleep?

10:42.209 --> 10:43.711
Were you worried about
your basketball game?

10:43.811 --> 10:46.279
No, I wasn't worried
about my basketball game!

10:46.379 --> 10:48.448
Did you screw up in
history again, Darlene.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.650
No, I didn't screw
up in history again!

10:50.751 --> 10:52.552
Then what is the matter?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.287
I got my period, OK!

10:57.590 --> 10:59.927
[darlene yells off-screen]

11:06.834 --> 11:08.668
[knocking]

11:08.769 --> 11:09.636
Hi, sis.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.038
Hey, Jackie.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.941
Welcome to you-wash-we-pay
laundromat.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.442
You think the only
reason I come over here

11:15.542 --> 11:16.777
is to do my laundry?

11:16.877 --> 11:19.046
Now I think you came over
for the free coffee, too.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.413
Get out of here!

11:20.513 --> 11:22.249
I'm just kidding, sis.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.217
All right, what do you
guys think of this outfit

11:24.317 --> 11:25.853
to go rollerskating in?

11:25.953 --> 11:30.390
I think that that would look
great with your hair swept up.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.060
Yeah.
Chip loves my hair like that.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.361
Well, not too up
though, because I

11:34.461 --> 11:36.096
don't want nobody
mistaking you for some kind

11:36.196 --> 11:38.698
of cocktail waitress.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.268
- Mom!
- So what's new?

11:41.368 --> 11:42.602
Darlene got her
period last night.

11:42.702 --> 11:43.503
[gasp]

11:43.603 --> 11:44.905
You're kidding!

11:45.005 --> 11:46.139
She's only 11.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.408
Well, I was only 11.

11:48.508 --> 11:52.612
Yeah, but you were
already wearing a D cup.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.713
Yeah, two of them.

11:56.616 --> 11:59.452
So I guess she's
pretty upset, huh?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.521
Yeah, and I wish she'd
talk to me about it.

12:01.621 --> 12:02.856
Give her some time.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.358
Poor kid's just
been sentenced to 35

12:05.458 --> 12:08.195
years of monthly inconvenience.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.729
Well, gee, Jackie.

12:09.830 --> 12:13.233
I only hope I can find a way to
impart that lightened viewpoint

12:13.333 --> 12:14.201
onto my daughter.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.803
You will.

12:15.903 --> 12:20.974
Just tell you about all these
famous athletic women types

12:21.074 --> 12:23.476
and how they all get their
periods too, like that?

12:23.576 --> 12:26.279
Yeah, why didn't
I think of that?

12:26.379 --> 12:28.515
Well, no matter
what you tell her,

12:28.615 --> 12:31.051
it's going to be better
than the way Mom handled it.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.520
[both laughing]

12:33.620 --> 12:35.588
Remember she'd tell us if we
had any questions (NASAL VOICE)

12:35.688 --> 12:37.557
to feel free to ask
the school nurse.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.460
I know.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.896
So what-- what about--

12:42.996 --> 12:48.135
she brought pamphlets
home from the Red Cross.

12:48.235 --> 12:51.704
For two weeks, I thought what
I had was a national disaster.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.807
Well, to Mom, it was.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.243
When I got mine, she cried
for three days about how

12:56.343 --> 12:58.678
she'd lost her little baby.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.780
Yeah, well, you had
it easy, sis, because I

13:00.881 --> 13:03.516
had to break that woman in.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.885
She was a basket case.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.854
She almost ruined the
whole thing for me.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.288
You are so weird.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.390
It was like you were
looking forward to it.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.192
Well, yeah, I was
finally doing something

13:12.292 --> 13:15.328
that Mom couldn't control.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.697
Besides, it meant I wasn't
going to get any more Nancy

13:17.797 --> 13:20.367
Drew books for my birthday.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.003
I was just trying
to find a cure for it.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.304
It's not a disease.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.272
I know it's not.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.407
But I-- it felt like it.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.342
And I thought I couldn't
go swimming anymore,

13:29.442 --> 13:32.512
and I couldn't horse
around with the boys

13:32.612 --> 13:34.014
anymore like I used to--

13:34.114 --> 13:36.449
I bet that's exactly the
way Darlene feels right now.

13:36.549 --> 13:40.120
Yeah, I bet it is, too.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.621
I wish there was
some way to tell her.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.056
Even if she doesn't
feel like it now,

13:43.156 --> 13:45.625
this is really
something to celebrate.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.827
You know, she's finally
becoming a full-fledged member

13:47.928 --> 13:50.063
of the woman race.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.365
And here comes
our newest member.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.001
Hey, Aunt Jackie.

13:54.101 --> 13:56.636
Hi, honey.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.738
How you feeling?

13:58.838 --> 13:59.672
God, Mom!

13:59.772 --> 14:02.475
Do you have to tell
the whole world?

14:02.575 --> 14:04.377
[door slams]

14:04.477 --> 14:06.613
Jackie, does the phrase
"timing is everything"

14:06.713 --> 14:08.215
ring a bell here at all?

14:11.784 --> 14:14.654
[door closes and locks]

14:16.289 --> 14:17.424
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.425
I didn't know you were here.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.759
It's OK-- hey,
wait a minute, honey.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.660
Oh.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.065
Good going.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.106
Thanks, Dad.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.075
Uh, wait-- wait
a second, honey.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.010
Uh.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.778
What are they talking
about in there?

14:38.878 --> 14:41.248
Oh, they're all yakking
about Becky's hair, you know.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.715
Yeah.

14:42.815 --> 14:46.053
So how's it coming?

14:46.153 --> 14:47.420
All right.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.456
I don't know if she'll ever
float, but she's coming.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.025
[taps boat]

14:52.125 --> 14:52.926
Slowl--

14:53.026 --> 14:54.727
Oh, there's my basketball!

14:54.827 --> 14:56.329
I knew I left it somewhere.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.365
Yeah, hey, what
time's your game?

14:58.465 --> 14:59.399
1:30.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.333
Oh, yeah, that's right.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.503
Uh, well, you got
plenty of time.

15:03.603 --> 15:04.404
Loads.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.273
Yeah.

15:06.373 --> 15:07.707
You know, you don't--

15:07.807 --> 15:10.010
have to play if you don't--

15:10.110 --> 15:11.778
feel like it.

15:11.878 --> 15:12.679
I know.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.416
Are you, uh--

15:16.516 --> 15:18.018
you going to play?

15:18.118 --> 15:19.519
I dunno.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.488
Oh.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.455
[sighs]

15:22.555 --> 15:24.791
Well, uh, listen, uh.

15:24.891 --> 15:27.127
What?

15:27.227 --> 15:28.261
I think I should
say something.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.229
You don't have to!

15:29.329 --> 15:32.532
No, I know I don't
have to, but I--

15:32.632 --> 15:33.800
I should say something.

15:33.900 --> 15:34.767
[chair rolls]

15:34.867 --> 15:35.768
Here.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.204
[pats chair]

15:37.304 --> 15:39.672
[sighs]

15:40.907 --> 15:42.309
Grandpa says they used
to have laces on them.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.852
Yeah-- what?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.187
Basketballs.

15:54.287 --> 15:59.159
Oh yeah, they did--
they had laces on them.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.060
Dad!

16:00.160 --> 16:01.061
How do I look?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.665
Beautiful.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.101
Guys aren't supposed
to look beautiful!

16:08.201 --> 16:09.269
Damn beautiful.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.203
That's better!

16:14.907 --> 16:16.709
Where was I?

16:16.809 --> 16:18.011
Not sure.

16:18.111 --> 16:18.911
Oh, yeah.

16:19.012 --> 16:21.114
I was going to say something.

16:21.214 --> 16:24.851
And, uh, sometimes
saying something-- as far

16:24.951 --> 16:26.286
as your father is
concerned-- isn't

16:26.386 --> 16:28.555
the easiest thing in the world.
- I know.

16:28.655 --> 16:36.196
Yeah, so-- well, basically
what it boils down to is this--

16:36.296 --> 16:38.765
this is basically
what it boils down to.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.167
What?

16:40.267 --> 16:42.535
Um.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.137
Darlene.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.038
Yeah?

16:49.076 --> 16:49.876
I love you.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.081
I love you too, Daddy.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.487
Well, uh, here, in case
you decide you want to play.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.388
Thanks.

17:01.488 --> 17:06.326
Yeah, uh-- hey, good going.

17:09.096 --> 17:09.896
Thanks.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.301
Ugh.

17:17.870 --> 17:21.208
[theme music]

17:24.744 --> 17:26.613
[knocking on door]

17:26.713 --> 17:27.514
(IMPATIENT) What?

17:32.919 --> 17:35.222
So what'd your
daddy have to say?

17:35.322 --> 17:36.989
You want to know
what Dad said?

17:37.090 --> 17:44.097
He said, so, good going.

17:44.197 --> 17:49.001
My life is over, and
he congratulated me.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.437
What are you doing?

17:50.537 --> 17:53.773
Getting rid all this junk.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.842
Oh, I get it.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.110
[garbage bag crinkling]

17:57.210 --> 17:59.979
You think you got to leave
this stuff behind you now.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.149
Like women have to
give up baseball gloves

18:02.249 --> 18:04.817
and start wearing
aprons and stuff.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.086
All I know is I'm
not shaving my legs

18:07.187 --> 18:08.988
or wearing pantyhose like Becky.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.463
You think I make Becky put
on makeup and wear perfume?

18:16.563 --> 18:18.030
No.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.599
No, she does it,
because she's always

18:19.699 --> 18:21.501
liked that kind of stuff.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.536
That's the kind of
woman she wants to be.

18:23.636 --> 18:27.039
Well, that's not the
kind of woman I want to be.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.175
Well, then what
are you throwing

18:28.275 --> 18:30.343
all your stuff away for?

18:30.443 --> 18:32.179
These are a girl's
things, Darlene,

18:32.279 --> 18:35.081
as long as a girl uses them.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.250
You love all this stuff.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.118
That's reason enough to keep it.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.087
I'm probably going to
start throwing like a girl

18:41.188 --> 18:44.123
now, anyway.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.125
Definitely, and since
you got your period,

18:46.226 --> 18:47.560
you're going to be
throwing a lot farther.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.633
Oh God, why me?

18:53.733 --> 18:55.001
Because you're lucky.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.236
(SARCASTICALLY) Right!

18:56.336 --> 18:57.136
Move.

19:00.507 --> 19:06.679
Now, you-- you get to be part
of the whole cycle of things,

19:06.779 --> 19:10.016
you know, the moon, and
the water, and the seasons.

19:12.752 --> 19:16.189
It's almost magical, Darlene.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.191
And you should be
really proud today,

19:18.291 --> 19:21.394
because this is the
beginning of a lot of really

19:21.494 --> 19:23.863
wonderful things in your life.

19:23.963 --> 19:27.066
Yeah, cramps.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.202
Well, I'll admit that's
one of the highlights,

19:29.302 --> 19:34.073
but I'm talking about a part
that's even better than that.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.410
Name one good thing that could
come out of this whole mess!

19:37.510 --> 19:39.246
OK, I'll name three.

19:39.346 --> 19:42.982
OK, Becky, DJ, and--

19:43.082 --> 19:44.251
what's that other
kid's name, you

19:44.351 --> 19:46.185
know that real kind of
bratty one-- what's her name?

19:46.286 --> 19:47.086
Mom!

19:47.186 --> 19:48.421
No, it's not Mom.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.958
It's, uh, what is it?

19:52.058 --> 19:54.727
Darlene.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.729
Yeah, that's what
it is, Darlene.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.271
Thanks, Mom.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.171
Could you go now?

20:09.642 --> 20:11.544
Yeah, one more thing.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.079
Watch out for those mood swings.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.120
I don't know, bub.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.989
I think the Cubs are going
to have trouble with the Mets

20:23.089 --> 20:23.856
this year.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.492
I hate the Mets.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.627
You and me both.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.696
Give me a smooch on that one.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.898
[kiss]

20:31.998 --> 20:35.234
So did Chip kiss
you goodnight?

20:35.335 --> 20:36.436
Yeah.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.171
Does that mean I can't?

20:39.272 --> 20:40.473
You can have this cheek.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.941
Oh, thanks.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.210
[kiss]

20:44.311 --> 20:47.647
You know, you're my favorite
daughter, don't you?

20:47.747 --> 20:48.548
Good night, Mom.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.249
Night.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.217
Hi!

20:51.318 --> 20:53.085
Hello!

20:53.185 --> 20:56.956
What's this I hear about a kiss?

20:57.056 --> 20:58.625
Chip's my boyfriend.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.226
He can kiss me.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.429
Where did you kiss you?

21:02.529 --> 21:03.296
Right there.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.564
- Where?
- There.

21:04.664 --> 21:05.197
- Where?
- There!

21:05.298 --> 21:06.566
Where?

21:06.666 --> 21:08.067
Muah.

21:08.167 --> 21:08.968
Good night, princess.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.003
Good night, Dad.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.439
I think after a
good night's sleep,

21:12.539 --> 21:13.973
I'll feel better in the morning.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.408
I don't know how to
tell you this, honey,

21:15.508 --> 21:17.610
but you ain't going to feel
better for about 40 years.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.216
[kiss]

21:24.317 --> 21:25.418
Good night.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.087
You know you're my favorite
daughter, don't you?

21:28.187 --> 21:29.589
But of course.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.723
Hmm.

21:30.823 --> 21:31.624
Voila.

21:31.724 --> 21:32.525
Feed me!

21:32.625 --> 21:35.562
