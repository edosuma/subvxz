WEBVTT

00:04.405 --> 00:06.049
Why is everything rusted,
Grandpa?

00:06.073 --> 00:08.251
That's what happens
when junk gets old.

00:08.275 --> 00:10.053
Well, you're not rusted.

00:10.077 --> 00:11.555
Well, I'm not junk
and I'm not old.

00:11.579 --> 00:12.956
You look old.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.825
You want to live to see eight?
I'd just shut up,

00:14.849 --> 00:16.158
and pick something out,
if I were you.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.195
Do I really get to break
anything I want?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.496
It's your birthday.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.731
Take a look around here,

00:20.755 --> 00:22.382
see if there's anything
catches your eye.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.003
Oh, wow, Grandpa.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.005
Yeah, I figured that'd
be just the ticket.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.940
Come on, I got it all
locked and loaded.

00:29.964 --> 00:31.408
Let's see how these fit.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.276
Cool.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.978
Perfect.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.514
There's your control panel.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.716
Now, the most important thing
about this, Tommy,

00:39.740 --> 00:41.284
is you do not tell your mother.

00:41.308 --> 00:42.686
Okay.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.871
What are you waiting for,
some overtime? Hit it!

00:53.187 --> 00:54.831
Does it hurt?

00:54.855 --> 00:56.800
- No.
- Are you sure?

00:56.824 --> 00:58.702
Yeah, it's a car.
It doesn't feel anything.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.956
Then why is it bleeding?

01:42.069 --> 01:43.947
The First Amendment:

01:43.971 --> 01:47.184
Freedom of the press,
religion, assembly,

01:47.208 --> 01:49.219
- petition and...
- Yeah, well,

01:49.243 --> 01:50.487
you go get a life, too,
you little pipsqueak!

01:50.511 --> 01:52.489
Speech!

01:52.513 --> 01:54.858
Clearly they did not have Tony
in mind when writing that.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.917
I don't want to see you!

01:58.252 --> 01:59.719
The little rat "nexted" me!

02:01.589 --> 02:02.833
Hi, there.

02:02.857 --> 02:03.867
Hey, I'm Tony.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.001
What's he doing?

02:05.025 --> 02:06.002
Annoying me.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.404
Besides that.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.239
It's called random chat.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.507
It's through a Web site

02:10.531 --> 02:12.658
that video-connects you
to random strangers.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.479
- Come on!
- A person doesn't like

02:15.503 --> 02:16.546
who they're chatting with,

02:16.570 --> 02:17.948
they just hit "next"
and move on.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.483
Let me guess.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.041
Tony keeps getting "nexted."

02:22.443 --> 02:23.620
This I must see.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.888
It's not funny, Ziva.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.223
Longest I've gone is
ten seconds.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.757
Well, perhaps you're
not as interesting

02:27.781 --> 02:29.226
as you think you are.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.027
This from coming from a woman
reading the Bill of Rights

02:31.051 --> 02:33.363
for entertainment.
Get out of here. Back off!

02:33.387 --> 02:36.515
I don't want you taking credit
when I work it out.

02:38.726 --> 02:39.604
Hi, ladies.

02:39.628 --> 02:42.926
Ew! What are you, like 40?!

02:45.299 --> 02:47.611
Why would you want to talk
to complete strangers anyway?

02:47.635 --> 02:49.746
Okay, I'm just going to
have to up my game here.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.148
What can I do?

02:51.172 --> 02:53.884
Finger puppets
or maybe a furry...

02:53.908 --> 02:54.932
barnyard animal.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.010
I got it!

02:59.613 --> 03:01.591
Ha!

03:01.615 --> 03:03.606
Never fails to please.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.231
Hi, boss.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.800
- This isn't what it looks like.
- Yeah?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.836
Just out of curiosity,
how exactly does this look?

03:12.860 --> 03:15.505
It looks like
we got a dead Marine.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.008
Grab your gear.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.057
And a little self-respect,
DiNozzo.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.285
- You bring your laptop?
- Yeah, why?

03:28.309 --> 03:30.554
Bet I'd last longer than
ten seconds in random chat

03:30.578 --> 03:31.788
with this guy as a backdrop.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.823
Oh, Tony, you really
need to stop.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.992
- Will you stop?
- I'm not stopping.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.661
I stripped the car
myself yesterday.

03:37.685 --> 03:38.962
The trunk was empty.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.597
Do you have
any security cameras?

03:40.621 --> 03:41.781
He's got tons of them.

03:43.157 --> 03:44.434
But they're not hooked up
to anything.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.790
They're, uh, just for show.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.944
What's that for?

03:53.968 --> 03:55.979
Being brave.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.014
And I also heard
it's your birthday.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.216
It is.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.118
Uh, to whom do we have
the misfortune?

04:02.142 --> 04:04.387
Marine Corporal Ray Collins.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.022
Local LEOs
identified him, called us.

04:06.046 --> 04:08.959
Discarded in a junkyard
like a piece of trash.

04:08.983 --> 04:11.861
Did you know that the word
"junk" originally referred

04:11.885 --> 04:14.664
to nautical old rope
of uncertain origin?

04:14.688 --> 04:15.999
- Really?
- Yes.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.733
I did not know that.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.370
Eventually, it included
any discarded item.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.704
That's fascinating.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.740
No, I'll tell you
what's fascinating.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.243
Time of death, Duck?

04:26.267 --> 04:29.145
Uh, Mr. Palmer,
let's get our corporal

04:29.169 --> 04:31.014
to a more suitable work surface.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.716
I'm guessing the killer
dumps the body,

04:32.740 --> 04:34.985
hoping the trash compactor
will eliminate the evidence.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.086
I'm thinking mugging.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.577
Cash and credit cards
are missing.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.292
Well, I might agree with you

04:42.316 --> 04:44.580
if that were
the only thing missing.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.205
Meet Corporal Ray Collins.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.440
No family,

04:57.464 --> 05:00.109
single, and according
to his CO, no friends.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.178
But his fitness eval
is off the charts.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.146
Guessing that's
when he had feet.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.949
He was serving
in southwestern Afghanistan

05:06.973 --> 05:08.584
until he was court-martialed.

05:08.608 --> 05:09.652
Charges?

05:09.676 --> 05:11.554
- Everything.
- Larceny, drug dealing,

05:11.578 --> 05:12.655
assault.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.090
Might not have ended up
doing time,

05:14.114 --> 05:15.558
but he was definitely looking
at a dishonorable discharge.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.560
We were unable to trace
the corporal's movements

05:17.584 --> 05:18.794
prior to his murder.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.396
No credit card use.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.631
Didn't have a cell phone.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.332
No ATM camera walk-bys either.

05:23.356 --> 05:24.500
But look what I found.

05:24.524 --> 05:25.635
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:25.659 --> 05:29.405
meet the Ducati Desmosedici
Double-R.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.407
DMV records indicate that
Collins bought one last month.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.576
Added it to his
Harley collection.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.077
Ray liked motorcycles.

05:35.101 --> 05:37.914
Motorcycles he shouldn't be able
to afford on his base pay.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.315
He was into something.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.850
Unfortunately, with his record,

05:40.874 --> 05:43.819
there are dozens of people
with motive to kill him.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.821
Talk to the guys in his unit.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.391
See if you can find one
that actually did.

05:48.415 --> 05:49.659
Me?

05:49.683 --> 05:50.693
Like right now?

05:50.717 --> 05:51.861
Yes, you. Now.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.396
Well, did the director say
what it's about?

05:53.420 --> 05:54.397
No, he didn't.

05:54.421 --> 05:55.831
Can it wait, like, five minutes?

05:55.855 --> 05:57.466
He wants you here now.
Why five minutes?

05:57.490 --> 05:59.502
Because I had a breakthrough
in the case,

05:59.526 --> 06:00.870
and if Gibbs' Gibbsometer
is working,

06:00.894 --> 06:02.638
then he should be walking
through my door any second.

06:02.662 --> 06:05.041
- All I know is that he wants you right now...
- I gotta go.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.343
Do you know something
I don't know?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.878
Probably not.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.948
Director Vance's office called
and he wants to see me.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.482
- About what?
- I don't know.

06:13.506 --> 06:14.550
That's just the thing.

06:14.574 --> 06:15.851
It's a bad omen, though.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.887
I remember last time
the director wanted to see me...

06:17.911 --> 06:19.722
do you know about
the last time the director

06:19.746 --> 06:21.057
- wanted to see me?
- No.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.725
Okay, there's no sense
in mentioning that again.

06:22.749 --> 06:25.261
Abbs... you said
you had a breakthrough?

06:25.285 --> 06:26.362
About the case.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.463
Right.

06:27.487 --> 06:28.898
Work. Focus.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.933
Okay. So, Ducky found tissue

06:30.957 --> 06:32.568
underneath our victim's
fingernails.

06:32.592 --> 06:33.769
Most likely from the killer.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.271
I ran the DNA. No matches.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.539
Doesn't sound much
like a breakthrough.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.140
Well, it's not.
But it is helpful.

06:38.164 --> 06:39.909
Because all military DNA
is on file.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.935
Just means our killer
wasn't in the military.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.213
That rules out Director Vance.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.381
Abby.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.083
Right. Work.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.218
Okay, I heard that you
were having trouble tracking.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.053
Corporal Collins' movements
the night of the murder.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.857
Luckily, I haven't,
because he was wearing this.

06:54.881 --> 06:56.792
It's a state-of-the-art GPS
runner's watch.

06:56.816 --> 06:59.061
It tracks your progress,
suggests routes.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.830
It holds GPS data for 24 hours.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.023
I can give you a blow-by-blow.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.968
So, Corporal Collins,

07:05.992 --> 07:09.171
he went for a jog on base,
and then he went to eat,

07:09.195 --> 07:10.439
he wandered around for a bit.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.108
And then, for some reason,
spent two hours

07:12.132 --> 07:13.743
standing in the middle
of the street.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.777
That's good work.

07:14.801 --> 07:16.826
Get the address
to Tony and Ziva.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.048
Nice job.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.916
What the biohazardous material
is this?

07:20.940 --> 07:21.984
It's all they had.

07:22.008 --> 07:23.510
A mini-POW!?

07:24.544 --> 07:26.222
This is another bad omen.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.257
Gibbs, this does not bode well
for my future.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.793
Abby, I wouldn't worry about it.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.495
Why's that?

07:32.519 --> 07:34.663
Because I got your back.

07:34.687 --> 07:36.678
Always have had.

07:38.658 --> 07:41.670
Always will.

07:41.694 --> 07:43.672
I cried because I had no shoes.

07:43.696 --> 07:46.275
Then I met a man
who had no feet.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.611
An old Persian proverb.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.514
A reminder to appreciate
what we have.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.783
Because we can always have less.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.785
Or how about, uh,

07:55.809 --> 07:58.387
"Don't count your bowling balls
before they hatch, Fred."

07:58.411 --> 07:59.522
Fred?

07:59.546 --> 08:02.124
Uh, Fred Flintstone.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.225
It's a...

08:03.249 --> 08:05.861
an unexpectedly profound series

08:05.885 --> 08:07.863
from the, uh... Agent Gibbs!

08:07.887 --> 08:09.165
So good of you to join us.

08:09.189 --> 08:12.501
To join, uh, Dr. Mallard
in his autopsy that I...

08:12.525 --> 08:13.569
merely assist in.

08:13.593 --> 08:15.261
Yabba-Dabba-Doo!

08:18.698 --> 08:19.675
What do you got, Duck?

08:19.699 --> 08:20.843
A mess.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.746
And a troubling one. Yes.

08:23.770 --> 08:27.083
Dislocations across
his entire skeletal system.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.884
Likely caused
by the car crusher.

08:28.908 --> 08:30.186
That how he died?

08:30.210 --> 08:31.887
No, he bled to death.

08:31.911 --> 08:34.924
Collins was alive
when his feet were cut off?

08:34.948 --> 08:37.259
Alive, but I doubt conscious.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.595
He also has
a mandibular fracture.

08:39.619 --> 08:42.932
That was not caused
by the car crusher.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.935
This particular trauma
is consistent

08:45.959 --> 08:48.037
with a blow to the jaw
with something heavy...

08:48.061 --> 08:51.107
like a wrench
or a piece of pipe.

08:51.131 --> 08:54.643
So, someone knocked him out
and then chopped off his feet.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.745
Sawed them off, actually.

08:56.769 --> 09:00.049
For reasons I shall leave you
to speculate.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.817
You're right, Duck.

09:01.841 --> 09:03.119
Troubling.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.354
Oh, we haven't showed you
the troubling part yet.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.357
Mr. Palmer, would you, uh,
turn his head.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.293
It's some kind of welt.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.928
Uh, to be honest,

09:12.952 --> 09:15.097
aside from being
the sign of the Devil,

09:15.121 --> 09:17.299
I have no idea what it is.

09:17.323 --> 09:20.690
Or how it came to be there.

09:22.762 --> 09:25.708
Thank you, Mr. Secretary,
you're on with Director Vance.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.577
He said I was in trouble,
didn't he?

09:28.601 --> 09:30.646
- Actually...
- I mean, using government

09:30.670 --> 09:32.982
bandwidth to make private
voice-over-IP phone calls...

09:33.006 --> 09:34.216
I know that's against
regulations.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.551
Even if it was for charity.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.952
To help Save the Children

09:36.976 --> 09:38.721
prevent the four million
newborn deaths

09:38.745 --> 09:40.256
every year... four million!
Every year.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.957
You know what?
I make no excuses.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.827
I don't think the director wants
to talk about Save the Children.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.996
Then the infrastructure database

09:47.020 --> 09:48.497
that I loaned
to Habitat for Humanity?

09:48.521 --> 09:50.332
Okay, then that can

09:50.356 --> 09:51.834
just stay between us?

09:51.858 --> 09:53.159
He already knows.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.338
So what is it?

09:56.362 --> 09:57.940
Remember Alejandro Rivera,

09:57.964 --> 09:59.742
from the Justice Department
in Mexico?

09:59.766 --> 10:00.876
All of him.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.511
He wants you to fly
down to Mexico

10:02.535 --> 10:04.747
to speak at some
law enforcement symposium

10:04.771 --> 10:06.782
- their justice department is hosting.
- Nice!

10:06.806 --> 10:07.783
When do I leave?

10:07.807 --> 10:09.018
I think today.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.586
But the director
doesn't want you going alone.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.588
Says Mexico is too dangerous
these days.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.256
So he's sending an escort.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.225
Oh, God, as long
as it's not McGee.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.394
I mean, he's never any fun
to travel with, anyways,

10:18.418 --> 10:20.095
and lately he's been
acting all squirrelly

10:20.119 --> 10:22.865
ever since Alejandro tried
to undress me with his eyes.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.066
Hi.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.523
The, uh, director
wanted to see me?

10:27.460 --> 10:28.950
Hey.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.842
Is this it?

10:33.866 --> 10:35.644
This is the location
Abby gave us.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.112
Right here.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.280
By the truck?

10:38.304 --> 10:39.706
According to Abby's
coordinates...

10:42.542 --> 10:43.770
in the truck.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.960
Bet Abby could last longer
than ten seconds

10:50.984 --> 10:52.962
playing random chat.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.797
- You are obsessed.
- You wouldn't understand.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.098
Why is that?

10:56.122 --> 10:58.200
Because being irritating
is second nature to you.

10:58.224 --> 10:59.592
Me, I'm charming.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.197
That's not charming.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.213
That's a bloody table.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.034
Tony...

11:30.155 --> 11:31.679
- Buenos dias, Señorita.
- Hi.

11:33.425 --> 11:35.003
Hey, Abbs, Abbs. Slow down.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.838
I don't want to miss anything.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.039
Like what, the burrito bar?

11:38.063 --> 11:39.741
Are you going
to be a party pooper

11:39.765 --> 11:41.699
this entire trip, McGee?
Come on.

11:43.402 --> 11:45.537
Señor.

11:49.541 --> 11:51.920
You know, the last
time I was in Mexico,

11:51.944 --> 11:55.390
Montezuma got his revenge on me
in a very, very big way.

11:55.414 --> 11:57.292
I was sick for a month.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.994
It's called
bottled water, McGee.

12:00.018 --> 12:02.263
Maybe this time
you won't be so cheap.

12:02.287 --> 12:04.599
You saw the text
that Tony sent me.

12:04.623 --> 12:05.767
I mean, look at that.

12:05.791 --> 12:07.502
It's got to be a serial killer.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.170
As soon as I go out of town,

12:09.194 --> 12:10.262
- you know, they...
- Abby!

12:11.730 --> 12:14.042
Bienvenido, Ms. Sciuto.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.710
Hola.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.745
Ah, so thrilled
you could make it.

12:17.769 --> 12:18.847
I trust your flight
was pleasant?

12:18.871 --> 12:20.748
Oh, it was. Boy, my...

12:20.772 --> 12:22.307
My arms sure are tired.

12:23.575 --> 12:24.819
Not too tired, I hope.

12:24.843 --> 12:26.087
You're going to need them.

12:26.111 --> 12:27.355
Uh, for what?

12:27.379 --> 12:28.623
Uh, we have a stack

12:28.647 --> 12:30.325
of old cold cases
waiting for you,

12:30.349 --> 12:31.759
and a class of eager students

12:31.783 --> 12:33.928
hoping you will share your
forensic expertise with them.

12:33.952 --> 12:35.363
Sounds like
I'm going to be busy.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.565
Sí, but not so busy, perhaps,

12:37.589 --> 12:39.067
that you will not
have time for...

12:39.091 --> 12:41.536
Let's just say "busy,"
leave it at that.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.357
Oh, I... I apologize.

12:44.496 --> 12:45.974
Agent McGoo, no?

12:45.998 --> 12:47.132
McGee.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.246
Unfortunately,
there is only one room available

12:51.270 --> 12:53.214
at the Justice Department's
guest quarters.

12:53.238 --> 12:55.116
Well, then,
we'll check into a hotel.

12:55.140 --> 12:56.851
Yeah, I do not recommend it.

12:56.875 --> 12:58.686
The entire reason
for this symposium is

12:58.710 --> 13:01.489
the escalating violence
from the local drug wars.

13:01.513 --> 13:04.559
I really must insist
you stay here together,

13:04.583 --> 13:08.383
however distasteful we...
all may find it.

13:12.257 --> 13:15.103
No regard for protocol.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.938
Human remains are
to be processed

13:16.962 --> 13:18.473
in the autopsy garage.

13:18.497 --> 13:22.143
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say serial killer.

13:22.167 --> 13:23.745
A limb. Nice.

13:23.769 --> 13:25.313
Can I give you a hand?

13:25.337 --> 13:27.115
These are terrible jokes.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.683
You got time for jokes,
do you, DiNozzo?

13:28.707 --> 13:29.851
That mean you got our killer?

13:29.875 --> 13:31.753
Uh, working on it. License plate

13:31.777 --> 13:33.321
stolen, uh,
VIN's been scraped off.

13:33.345 --> 13:34.522
No prints.

13:34.546 --> 13:36.291
There are over 1,000

13:36.315 --> 13:39.794
similar registered vehicles
with the Maryland DMV alone.

13:39.818 --> 13:40.995
We'll narrow it down.

13:41.019 --> 13:42.697
Corporal Collins was unconscious

13:42.721 --> 13:44.799
when he was dismembered.

13:44.823 --> 13:48.336
It's safe to assume
that, uh, these were, as well.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.871
Or what's left of them.

13:49.895 --> 13:51.272
And the rest of them?

13:51.296 --> 13:52.941
I don't think that's soap scum.

13:52.965 --> 13:55.109
Most likely sulfuric acid.

13:55.133 --> 13:57.712
It is the only acid
strong enough to dissolve bone.

13:57.736 --> 13:58.947
Collins' body was dumped.

13:58.971 --> 14:00.548
The rest of them weren't.

14:00.572 --> 14:01.883
Why?

14:01.907 --> 14:03.685
Well, I'd have
to perform a psychological

14:03.709 --> 14:05.520
autopsy to answer that question.

14:05.544 --> 14:07.622
But I can tell you one thing.

14:07.646 --> 14:09.190
We have the killer's trophies,

14:09.214 --> 14:11.893
which means, well,
he'll want to kill again.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.628
We need to find out
who he's targeting.

14:13.652 --> 14:15.563
Think I got a lead on that.

14:15.587 --> 14:16.998
Autopsy Gremlin?

14:17.022 --> 14:18.666
Scram.

14:18.690 --> 14:20.835
These look familiar.

14:20.859 --> 14:23.238
Motorcycle gang tattoos.

14:23.262 --> 14:26.322
Same here. Same here.

14:27.666 --> 14:29.827
Our killer's targeting bikers.

14:34.239 --> 14:36.217
This is gonna be fun.

14:36.241 --> 14:38.219
I've always wanted
to be a teacher.

14:38.243 --> 14:41.356
Are you going to eat throughout
my entire presentation?

14:41.380 --> 14:45.593
Mm. I read the local yogurt
is amazing for your stomach.

14:45.617 --> 14:49.397
True. Lactobacillus
aids in digestion.

14:49.421 --> 14:52.367
However, that is unpasteurized.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.502
Well, is that bad?

14:54.526 --> 14:55.903
In Mexico?

14:55.927 --> 14:58.764
You might as well just
shoot yourself now.

14:59.898 --> 15:01.843
Oh, here they come.

15:01.867 --> 15:03.411
Hola.

15:03.435 --> 15:04.993
Bienvenidos...

15:05.971 --> 15:07.682
encantado.

15:07.706 --> 15:08.683
¿Como estás?

15:08.707 --> 15:10.918
Buenos días.

15:10.942 --> 15:12.887
Mucho gusto.

15:12.911 --> 15:14.689
My name is Abby Sciuto.

15:14.713 --> 15:16.958
I am a forensic scientist
with the Naval.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.760
Criminal Investigative Service.

15:18.784 --> 15:20.452
And this is...

15:21.453 --> 15:23.598
That was Agent McGee,

15:23.622 --> 15:25.600
who just ate
some unpasteurized yogurt,

15:25.624 --> 15:27.735
and he's probably gonna go
make himself throw up.

15:27.759 --> 15:28.936
Any questions?

15:28.960 --> 15:30.638
Okay.

15:30.662 --> 15:34.642
Well, today's lecture is
on the forensics of cold cases.

15:34.666 --> 15:36.944
We will be working
on an actual case

15:36.968 --> 15:39.213
provided by your government.

15:39.237 --> 15:41.115
It's the gangland hit

15:41.139 --> 15:44.252
of a drug trafficker,
almost 20 years old.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.387
Doesn't get much colder
than that.

15:46.411 --> 15:47.878
Any questions?

15:49.681 --> 15:50.892
Yes.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.852
Who told you the
Day of the Dead was in May?

15:57.522 --> 15:58.900
Your name is?

15:58.924 --> 16:00.668
Let me guess. Natalia.

16:00.692 --> 16:02.637
You can read.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.505
I can read.

16:04.529 --> 16:06.941
I can also tell
that you have cats.

16:06.965 --> 16:09.744
Anyone could tell I have a cat.

16:09.768 --> 16:12.780
One orange tabby
and two calicos.

16:12.804 --> 16:14.949
You're allergic to citrus.

16:14.973 --> 16:16.250
You went bowling last night.

16:16.274 --> 16:18.453
You're Vitamin D deficient.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.688
Oh, and you're ovulating.

16:20.712 --> 16:22.737
Any more questions?

16:25.817 --> 16:27.795
Great. Back to the case.

16:27.819 --> 16:31.632
Which, because of
some very shoddy police work,

16:31.656 --> 16:33.701
has almost no forensic evidence.

16:33.725 --> 16:35.703
So I hope you brought
your walking shoes,

16:35.727 --> 16:38.172
'cause we are going
in the field.

16:38.196 --> 16:41.275
This is the last biker bar
we're hitting today.

16:41.299 --> 16:43.835
I'm starting to smell
like monkey grease.

16:46.471 --> 16:48.803
Somehow I think
you won't mind this one.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.687
Hello, kitty. Meow.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.655
Wow. Want to take this,
or should I?

16:54.679 --> 16:55.957
- 'Cause I kind of got a feeling that...
- Mm.

16:55.981 --> 16:57.191
You know what?
I got it. I got it.

16:57.215 --> 16:58.459
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:58.483 --> 16:59.727
if I could have
your attention, please.

16:59.751 --> 17:00.862
- Hi.
- Whatever.

17:00.886 --> 17:03.664
I'm, uh, Special Agent
Tony DiNozzo.

17:03.688 --> 17:05.133
This is my partner.

17:05.156 --> 17:06.800
We'd like
to ask you some questions.

17:06.825 --> 17:09.804
We're looking for information
about this guy,

17:09.828 --> 17:11.239
Corporal Ray Collins.

17:11.262 --> 17:14.398
He was murdered,
and he's... he's a very...

17:17.068 --> 17:19.313
I've lost my mojo.

17:19.337 --> 17:21.182
It's like random chat,
only in the real world.

17:21.205 --> 17:24.484
Perhaps it needs
a woman's touch, so...

17:24.509 --> 17:26.170
Not unless that
woman's got a warrant.

17:27.244 --> 17:28.656
You got a warrant?

17:28.680 --> 17:29.824
No.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.059
We would like to ask
a few questions.

17:32.083 --> 17:34.711
You know what I would like?

17:35.954 --> 17:37.198
You to leave.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.599
Look, people.

17:38.623 --> 17:40.568
There is a serial killer
on the loose.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.103
He's targeting bikers.

17:42.127 --> 17:43.404
Does that interest you?

17:43.428 --> 17:46.741
Only thing
that interests me is you...

17:46.765 --> 17:48.892
leaving now.

17:52.637 --> 17:54.104
We're leaving now.

17:58.376 --> 18:00.087
Okay.

18:00.111 --> 18:01.856
Sorry about that.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.591
Putting on a little show
for the kiddies, huh?

18:03.615 --> 18:05.960
If I wanted to stay
in business, yeah.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.395
Velvet Road.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.563
Oh. Tony.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.231
Let's keep this quick.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.267
Yes. So any information
on Corporal Collins?

18:13.291 --> 18:16.704
Not much, but I have seen
that guy around.

18:16.728 --> 18:18.606
I don't know
who he runs with, but I know

18:18.630 --> 18:20.141
who he's been sleeping with.

18:20.165 --> 18:22.109
- Who's he been sleeping with?
- Everyone.

18:22.133 --> 18:25.446
He probably slept
with the wrong guy's girl.

18:25.470 --> 18:27.482
Well, he's not the only one
who's dead.

18:27.506 --> 18:28.783
I'm not surprised.

18:28.807 --> 18:30.818
I know some riders so jealous,

18:30.842 --> 18:32.720
you just look
at their girl wrong,

18:32.744 --> 18:34.388
they'll kill you.

18:34.412 --> 18:35.811
You got any names?

18:37.349 --> 18:39.827
I got a whole bunch.

18:39.851 --> 18:43.030
There are many ways by which
a cold case can be solved.

18:43.054 --> 18:44.612
Anyone?

18:45.524 --> 18:46.667
Agent McGee.

18:46.691 --> 18:49.770
Well, uh, new witnesses
can step forward.

18:49.794 --> 18:52.139
Alibis can fall through, or

18:52.163 --> 18:53.908
new information
can come to light.

18:53.932 --> 18:57.445
This new information usually
comes from forensic evidence.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.514
Which we're going to have
to find on our own,

18:59.538 --> 19:01.148
because this case
has virtually none.

19:01.172 --> 19:02.617
What we know is this:

19:02.641 --> 19:05.152
20 years ago,
a traficante de drogos...

19:05.176 --> 19:08.823
a drug dealer named Pedro
Hernandez... he left a cafe,

19:08.847 --> 19:10.858
he got in his vehicle
to go home,

19:10.882 --> 19:12.960
and he was gunned down
at point-blank range

19:12.984 --> 19:14.495
in a gang-style shooting.

19:14.519 --> 19:17.064
His vehicle was abandoned
after the incident,

19:17.088 --> 19:18.612
so that's where
we're gonna start.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.470
Lesson number one.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.438
Beware shoddy police work.

19:24.462 --> 19:27.508
For example,
this fracture pattern.

19:27.532 --> 19:29.443
It tells me

19:29.467 --> 19:31.812
that the bullet that shattered
the glass was traveling

19:31.836 --> 19:34.882
at an unusually high velocity,
which means?

19:34.906 --> 19:36.684
Agent McGee?

19:36.708 --> 19:38.686
Some kind of long-range weapon.

19:38.710 --> 19:42.657
Which also means
this police report is wrong.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.517
He was not shot point-blank.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.677
Are we expecting more students?

19:51.222 --> 19:52.689
I don't think
those are students.

19:59.731 --> 20:01.542
You're trespassing.

20:01.566 --> 20:03.244
This is public property.

20:03.268 --> 20:04.345
We were just leaving.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.948
Actually, no.

20:06.972 --> 20:08.132
You're not.

20:17.415 --> 20:19.159
Line up.

20:19.183 --> 20:20.251
All of you.

20:23.654 --> 20:25.132
It's probably a good time
to start praying, too.

20:25.156 --> 20:27.501
Uh, can we just slow down
here for a second?

20:27.525 --> 20:29.322
Sorry, I have lunch plans.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.805
Would it help you to know that

20:31.829 --> 20:33.674
I am a guest of your government?

20:33.698 --> 20:35.642
- Abby.
- What?

20:35.666 --> 20:38.045
Okay.

20:38.069 --> 20:39.559
Maybe I won't kill you.

20:41.139 --> 20:43.450
Maybe I take you
hostage instead.

20:43.474 --> 20:45.032
See how much you're worth.

20:47.278 --> 20:49.356
My name is Timothy McGee.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.358
I'm a United States
federal agent.

20:51.382 --> 20:53.260
I'm worth a lot to them, okay?

20:53.284 --> 20:56.981
Now, you just let them go,
you can keep me.

21:02.493 --> 21:04.605
You're a brave man,
Timothy McGee.

21:04.629 --> 21:06.340
Do you know who I am?

21:06.364 --> 21:08.175
No.

21:08.199 --> 21:10.644
My name is Paloma Reynosa.

21:10.668 --> 21:12.613
"Reynosa." As in?

21:12.637 --> 21:14.148
Reynosa drug cartel.

21:14.172 --> 21:16.183
At least, that's what
you would call it.

21:16.207 --> 21:19.286
I prefer to think of it
as the family business.

21:19.310 --> 21:20.654
We're screwed.

21:20.678 --> 21:22.890
What's an NCIS agent
doing so far from home?

21:22.914 --> 21:24.892
He's my escort.

21:24.916 --> 21:29.029
I'm teaching a class
on the forensics of cold cases.

21:29.053 --> 21:32.955
And this truck...
it's your classroom?

21:34.125 --> 21:35.869
We're using the murder
of a man named

21:35.893 --> 21:37.495
Pedro Hernandez as a case study.

21:38.863 --> 21:40.674
Old Pedro?

21:40.698 --> 21:43.243
That was a long time ago.

21:43.267 --> 21:44.734
What could you
possibly learn now?

21:45.870 --> 21:48.315
Well, for example,

21:48.339 --> 21:50.384
the police report... it's wrong.

21:50.408 --> 21:52.319
He wasn't shot point-blank.

21:52.343 --> 21:54.388
You are correct.

21:54.412 --> 21:57.391
He was killed by a sniper,
hiding on a ridge,

21:57.415 --> 21:58.973
almost a thousand meters
from here.

22:00.585 --> 22:03.330
How do you know that?

22:03.354 --> 22:05.899
Because the killer left behind
a message on that ridge.

22:05.923 --> 22:07.823
What message?

22:20.404 --> 22:22.565
Perhaps you will have
more use for it than I.

22:25.676 --> 22:27.667
I'll see what I can do.

22:30.781 --> 22:32.860
Love your shoes.

22:32.884 --> 22:34.061
Vamanos!

22:34.085 --> 22:36.954
Thanks.

22:46.097 --> 22:49.109
Jealousy can sure drive people
to do strange things.

22:49.133 --> 22:53.580
As can anything
born of deep-rooted insecurity.

22:53.604 --> 22:55.215
If I chopped the feet off
of every guy

22:55.239 --> 22:57.784
that gave Breena two looks...

22:57.808 --> 23:01.369
I would be up to my ears
in toe cheese.

23:02.346 --> 23:04.091
- What's that?
- Toe cheese.

23:04.115 --> 23:04.926
Oh, right.

23:04.950 --> 23:06.360
I hope you got something for me

23:06.384 --> 23:07.461
more than toe cheese, Duck.

23:07.485 --> 23:09.730
Yes, well, we certainly
have a lot of it.

23:09.754 --> 23:12.266
Times like these,
I regret not having a window.

23:12.290 --> 23:15.502
Although we are saved
from the more insidious odors

23:15.526 --> 23:18.338
by the fact that all these feet
have been salted.

23:18.362 --> 23:20.941
Killer preserving his trophies.

23:20.965 --> 23:23.810
Which explains the mobile
drying rack.

23:23.834 --> 23:25.812
It's a good way
of preventing the odors

23:25.836 --> 23:27.147
from alerting the neighbors.

23:27.171 --> 23:29.349
Makes it more difficult to
determine a time of death.

23:29.373 --> 23:31.318
Difficult but not impossible.

23:31.342 --> 23:33.654
Salt preservation retards

23:33.678 --> 23:36.757
bacterial growth,
but not insect activity.

23:36.781 --> 23:40.594
I was able to work out
a rough timeline.

23:40.618 --> 23:43.363
Uh, this one...

23:43.387 --> 23:45.165
was the first one cut off.

23:45.189 --> 23:46.816
Roughly two months ago.

23:47.858 --> 23:49.836
Good work.

23:49.860 --> 23:53.207
However,
unlike Corporal Collins,

23:53.231 --> 23:56.210
all of these victims
were already dead

23:56.234 --> 23:58.278
before their feet were removed.

23:58.302 --> 24:01.715
Vascular inflammation suggests
that their deaths

24:01.739 --> 24:03.483
were caused by
some kind of poison.

24:03.507 --> 24:07.254
Abby will determine
just what kind.

24:07.278 --> 24:10.457
Serial killers usually
don't change their MO.

24:10.481 --> 24:13.450
Not after so many
successful kills, no.

24:15.586 --> 24:17.564
So, who do you think she was?

24:17.588 --> 24:19.533
Well, I told you already.

24:19.557 --> 24:22.502
Paloma Reynosa... head of
the Reynosa drug cartel.

24:22.526 --> 24:24.538
She took over
after her husband died.

24:24.562 --> 24:28.408
No, I mean who do you think
she was to our cold case victim?

24:28.432 --> 24:29.843
Probably somebody pretty
important, considering

24:29.867 --> 24:31.878
she's been carrying around
that bullet all this time.

24:31.902 --> 24:33.893
Really don't know
much about her.

24:35.439 --> 24:38.018
Got a bad feeling
about this case.

24:38.042 --> 24:39.586
Yeah, I got a bad feeling
about this bed.

24:39.610 --> 24:42.556
You want to flip for the couch?

24:42.580 --> 24:45.192
Come on, McGee.

24:45.216 --> 24:48.195
It's not like we haven't shared
a bed together before.

24:48.219 --> 24:50.731
Well, technically,
that was a coffin.

24:50.755 --> 24:52.232
And I'm just letting you know

24:52.256 --> 24:54.301
that if you and I sleep
in this bed together,

24:54.325 --> 24:56.225
I am a Quasimodo for a week.

24:59.163 --> 25:02.009
Now I know why Ziva
took the couch in Paris.

25:02.033 --> 25:05.264
Tony said that
he took the couch in Paris.

25:11.208 --> 25:13.787
Why do you think la policía

25:13.811 --> 25:15.756
didn't investigate
this case further?

25:15.780 --> 25:17.557
Well...

25:17.581 --> 25:18.825
he was a drug dealer.

25:18.849 --> 25:21.695
And crimes like that...
a dime a dozen down here.

25:21.719 --> 25:22.696
Maybe.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.398
Maybe not.

25:24.422 --> 25:27.467
I think I'm developing
my own gut.

25:27.491 --> 25:28.902
Yeah, I was going
to mention to you,

25:28.926 --> 25:30.806
you look like you've
put on a few pounds lately.

25:32.163 --> 25:33.483
Come on. I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

25:34.565 --> 25:35.609
All right, that was silly.

25:35.633 --> 25:37.110
I'm sorry.

25:37.134 --> 25:39.046
Look, you look great. I mean,

25:39.070 --> 25:41.882
I actually noticed
that you've really

25:41.906 --> 25:44.051
looked great lately.

25:44.075 --> 25:45.619
Actually.

25:45.643 --> 25:48.476
Um... Where are you going?

25:49.780 --> 25:52.292
I'm going to sleep
on my lab table.

25:52.316 --> 25:54.094
Oh, come on. I said I was sorry.

25:54.118 --> 25:56.830
Oh... and you don't know
how much.

25:56.854 --> 25:58.098
What is that supposed to mean?

25:58.122 --> 26:01.301
You forgot to use bottled water
on your toothbrush.

26:01.325 --> 26:04.351
This is not a room
I want to sleep in tonight.

26:08.766 --> 26:10.143
Hi!

26:10.167 --> 26:11.778
Hey, baby. I'm the kind of man

26:11.802 --> 26:13.747
that can rock your world.

26:13.771 --> 26:14.981
Come meet the super freak.

26:15.005 --> 26:18.118
I'm like a friendly dolphin.

26:18.142 --> 26:20.587
Oh! Come on!

26:20.611 --> 26:21.822
You're pathetic.

26:21.846 --> 26:24.091
I've tried everything. Really.

26:24.115 --> 26:26.960
No matter what I do,
I can't get past ten seconds.

26:26.984 --> 26:29.096
Well, maybe you should
try something like working.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.264
We are looking for
a serial killer, Tony.

26:31.288 --> 26:32.666
I already earned my pay today.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.267
Really?

26:34.291 --> 26:36.169
What did you find?

26:36.193 --> 26:37.871
No way.

26:37.895 --> 26:40.173
I tell you, you tell Gibbs...
I got nothing.

26:40.197 --> 26:41.475
Look, I'm not gonna steal
your discovery, okay?

26:41.499 --> 26:42.476
I have my own.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.778
Really? What do you got?

26:44.802 --> 26:46.480
No way.

26:46.504 --> 26:48.749
If I tell you, you tell Gibbs.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.083
Gibbs is gonna find out anyway.

26:50.107 --> 26:51.651
Come on. Let's see it.

26:51.675 --> 26:54.588
Uh, well,
our jealous biker theory

26:54.612 --> 26:56.356
was a dead end;
All our names had alibis.

26:56.380 --> 26:57.758
We flashed Collins' picture

26:57.782 --> 26:59.493
at every motorcycle club
in the city.

26:59.517 --> 27:00.861
Got the same
story from everyone.

27:00.885 --> 27:02.796
- People saw him around.
- Yes, he comes and goes.

27:02.820 --> 27:04.931
He never stays at one place
for a long time.

27:04.955 --> 27:06.366
And I think I know why.

27:06.390 --> 27:08.535
Ray Collins,
you're our serial killer.

27:08.559 --> 27:11.772
On a hunch, I, uh,
e-mailed his photo to several

27:11.796 --> 27:13.340
different sulfuric acid
suppliers.

27:13.364 --> 27:14.975
And bingo.

27:14.999 --> 27:16.009
One of them recognized him.

27:16.033 --> 27:18.178
Said that
Corporal Collins bought

27:18.202 --> 27:19.446
a hundred gallons
two months ago.

27:19.470 --> 27:20.881
Circumstantial, Alice.

27:20.905 --> 27:23.650
Well, circum... yeah, but...

27:23.674 --> 27:26.286
Who's gonna have a picture of
the guy driving the foot mo...

27:26.310 --> 27:27.754
bile.

27:27.778 --> 27:30.223
- You got a picture of the guy driving the foot mobile?
- Yes.

27:30.247 --> 27:33.160
Making an illegal
right turn on red.

27:33.184 --> 27:35.061
I also had a hunch.

27:35.085 --> 27:36.329
- Got a timeline match?
- Yes.

27:36.353 --> 27:38.098
The killings started
just after Corporal Collins

27:38.122 --> 27:39.499
returned from Afghanistan.

27:39.523 --> 27:40.801
That's nice work.

27:40.825 --> 27:41.835
Both of you.

27:41.859 --> 27:43.503
Be even nicer
if you could figure out

27:43.527 --> 27:44.892
who killed Collins.

28:54.198 --> 28:56.309
Oh, my God.

28:56.333 --> 28:57.644
Abby...

28:57.668 --> 28:59.412
Morning.

28:59.436 --> 29:00.647
I just heard
what happened yesterday

29:00.671 --> 29:02.215
and came immediately
to see how you were doing.

29:02.239 --> 29:03.216
Oh, I'm okay.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.551
Oh, I wish you would have

29:04.575 --> 29:06.453
told me your plans,
so I could've said "no."

29:06.477 --> 29:08.622
So do I.

29:08.646 --> 29:10.857
The Reynosa
drug cartel is having

29:10.881 --> 29:12.425
distribution problems
at the moment.

29:12.449 --> 29:14.761
It's very dangerous
to go into their territory.

29:14.785 --> 29:18.665
Though it appears your
expedition provided some fruit.

29:18.689 --> 29:20.333
Maybe.

29:20.357 --> 29:22.402
As far as cold cases go,
this one's frigid.

29:22.426 --> 29:24.792
Oh, looks pretty warm to me.

29:26.196 --> 29:27.340
"Lapua"?

29:27.364 --> 29:30.231
It's a favorite
of snipers, is it not?

29:31.535 --> 29:33.179
I wouldn't draw any conclusions.

29:33.203 --> 29:35.916
It's also popular with
competitive shooters

29:35.940 --> 29:38.670
and, apparently, as jewelry.

29:40.110 --> 29:41.788
Something is bothering you.

29:41.812 --> 29:44.291
Whose idea was it for me
to come down here?

29:44.315 --> 29:46.760
Was it yours or was it
Director Vance's?

29:46.784 --> 29:49.796
Well, your director
simply approved.

29:49.820 --> 29:51.685
Oh, the idea was all mine.

29:56.994 --> 29:59.205
Who assigned me this case?

29:59.229 --> 30:01.308
Well, I don't know exactly.

30:01.332 --> 30:03.009
Uh, someone on my staff.

30:03.033 --> 30:04.778
Why?

30:04.802 --> 30:06.313
How well do you know your staff?

30:06.337 --> 30:08.848
Does this have something
to do with your cold case?

30:08.872 --> 30:10.216
You solved it?

30:10.240 --> 30:12.652
No. Not yet.

30:12.676 --> 30:15.076
But if I'm going to...

30:16.347 --> 30:19.214
I need you to exhume
the body of Pedro Hernandez.

30:20.923 --> 30:22.322
Oh, that could be arranged.

30:23.520 --> 30:26.114
And I need it sent back
to my people in DC.

30:28.592 --> 30:30.737
They're the only ones I trust.

30:30.761 --> 30:34.007
And we certainly wouldn't want
to convict the wrong person.

30:34.031 --> 30:36.676
No, of course not.

30:36.700 --> 30:39.779
The body of a drug dealer
from 20 years ago...

30:39.803 --> 30:41.948
I don't think anyone will mind.

30:41.972 --> 30:43.963
For you, I will make
the arrangements.

31:25.615 --> 31:26.859
Hola, McTaco.

31:26.883 --> 31:28.761
How was Mexico? Did you
bring anything back for me?

31:28.785 --> 31:30.996
An exhumed corpse, 20 years old.

31:31.020 --> 31:32.681
Like I wasn't
sick enough already.

31:33.823 --> 31:34.900
Where's Abby?

31:34.924 --> 31:36.435
Uh, she's already in the lab,

31:36.459 --> 31:38.270
checking the DNA
on your victims.

31:38.294 --> 31:41.974
Since I heard we're not the only
ones with an unsolved case.

31:41.998 --> 31:43.876
We solved the serial killings.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.611
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

31:45.635 --> 31:46.745
You would've loved it.

31:46.769 --> 31:49.415
Marine corporal poisoned
his victims and then

31:49.439 --> 31:52.151
he cut off their feet...
bloody stumps.

31:52.175 --> 31:54.953
Then he would take their bodies
and put them in a vat of acid.

31:54.977 --> 31:58.457
Yeah, and they would become
these viscous, gooey,

31:58.481 --> 32:00.726
molten, fleshy, bowls of...

32:00.750 --> 32:02.327
Of course, we still don't know

32:02.351 --> 32:03.662
who killed our killer.

32:03.686 --> 32:05.998
Well, maybe it's, uh,
it was for revenge.

32:06.022 --> 32:08.100
Maybe it's one of
the victim's family members?

32:08.124 --> 32:09.301
Yeah. It's Gibbs.

32:09.325 --> 32:10.836
Or a copycat killer.

32:10.860 --> 32:13.305
Corporal Collins' body was
mutilated just like his victims.

32:13.329 --> 32:14.807
I'm on my way, Duck.

32:14.831 --> 32:17.676
Not much in Corporal Collins'
background was actually helpful.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.011
Go back over it.

32:19.035 --> 32:20.412
Oh, we already
went over it, boss.

32:20.436 --> 32:22.147
Go back over it.

32:22.171 --> 32:23.968
But we're going
to go over it again.

32:26.843 --> 32:28.854
Wanted to see me, Duck?

32:28.878 --> 32:32.091
I do hope that's not another
victim I haven't heard about.

32:32.115 --> 32:34.259
A victim, yes, but not our case.

32:34.283 --> 32:36.862
I'm helping Abby
with one of hers.

32:36.886 --> 32:39.622
It's a cold case
from her Mexican symposium.

32:40.957 --> 32:42.334
Meet Pedro.

32:42.358 --> 32:46.271
Remarkably well-preserved
for a 20-year-old corpse.

32:46.295 --> 32:47.439
Pedro, huh?

32:47.463 --> 32:49.108
I believe so. Mr. Palmer?

32:49.132 --> 32:50.175
Uh, yep.

32:50.199 --> 32:51.757
Pedro Hernandez.

32:53.169 --> 32:54.947
Apparently,
a sniper gunned him down

32:54.971 --> 32:57.683
outside a small town in Mexico.

32:57.707 --> 32:59.618
The bullet that killed him

32:59.642 --> 33:01.787
ricocheted inside his skull...

33:01.811 --> 33:03.779
inside his skull...
inside his skull...

33:11.187 --> 33:12.531
Abby thinks she might

33:12.555 --> 33:14.733
be able to trace
the bullet, but...

33:14.757 --> 33:16.502
it's pretty old.

33:16.526 --> 33:17.903
Abby, huh?

33:17.927 --> 33:20.472
Yes, however,
I didn't call you down here

33:20.496 --> 33:22.574
to discuss ancient history.

33:22.598 --> 33:24.843
I've finished
my psychological profile

33:24.867 --> 33:27.513
of our dead serial killer.

33:27.537 --> 33:31.383
Although, I personally do not
believe he was a serial killer.

33:31.407 --> 33:33.352
Don't get me wrong, Jethro.

33:33.376 --> 33:35.521
I don't doubt
that Corporal Collins

33:35.545 --> 33:38.991
committed those murders,
but he shows

33:39.015 --> 33:40.993
none of the psychopathology

33:41.017 --> 33:43.996
that normally motivates
a serial killer.

33:44.020 --> 33:46.331
Yeah, what motivated him?

33:46.355 --> 33:48.233
I don't know.

33:48.257 --> 33:51.036
And until we know that,
we know nothing.

33:51.060 --> 33:52.371
Aha!

33:52.395 --> 33:54.386
Yeah.

33:58.267 --> 34:00.612
I think I have it.

34:00.636 --> 34:01.796
Ha-ha.

34:03.606 --> 34:06.439
Jethro, if, uh,
you would be so kind?

34:19.554 --> 34:22.534
Mr. Palmer, would you
run this up to Abby?

34:22.558 --> 34:23.969
I got it, Duck. I got it.

34:23.993 --> 34:26.393
Oh, thank you, Jethro.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.911
Gibbs.

34:58.261 --> 35:00.639
Got one more computer
to network to the search.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.608
Hey, boss.
I just want to let you know

35:02.632 --> 35:04.309
I am up to speed on this case.

35:04.333 --> 35:06.979
McGee is helping me run the DNA

35:07.003 --> 35:08.680
from the serial killer's
victims.

35:08.704 --> 35:10.415
I got one more I.D. to make,

35:10.439 --> 35:14.152
and, uh, over here, program
the computer to search for

35:14.176 --> 35:15.803
any similarities
between the victims.

35:17.346 --> 35:19.610
Is that another tissue sample?

35:28.357 --> 35:29.835
No.

35:29.859 --> 35:34.039
Okay, so, um,
I identified the poison

35:34.063 --> 35:36.508
that the serial killer used
to kill his victims.

35:36.532 --> 35:38.710
It's a snake venom-derived
neurotoxin.

35:38.734 --> 35:40.779
It causes the rapid
degeneration of a victim's

35:40.803 --> 35:42.381
synaptic nerves
and then their death.

35:42.405 --> 35:45.484
The snake itself is very rare...
the Asian sand viper.

35:45.508 --> 35:48.654
Found exclusively in southwest
Afghanistan, which was...

35:48.678 --> 35:50.355
That's where Collins
was stationed.

35:50.379 --> 35:51.723
And with the amounts
that he would've needed...

35:51.747 --> 35:53.612
easily could've gotten
past military customs.

35:54.317 --> 35:55.294
We got a ding.

35:55.318 --> 35:56.808
Pardon me.

35:57.486 --> 35:59.498
Okay.

35:59.522 --> 36:02.301
All victims were members
of a motorcycle gang. Knew that.

36:02.325 --> 36:04.760
All have various
criminal records. Figured that.

36:06.295 --> 36:09.207
Oh, no, there is one,
and only one, crime

36:09.231 --> 36:10.676
that they all have in common.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.577
Our serial killer's
targeting drug dealers.

36:12.601 --> 36:14.146
Yeah, well, the problem is.

36:14.170 --> 36:16.181
Ducky doesn't think
Collins was a serial killer.

36:16.205 --> 36:17.716
He's cutting off people's feet.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.685
Who does that other
than serial killers?

36:19.709 --> 36:21.486
I know who.

36:21.510 --> 36:22.754
Drug cartels.

36:22.778 --> 36:24.356
Well, by definition,
wouldn't they be selling

36:24.380 --> 36:25.590
drugs and not feet?

36:25.614 --> 36:27.192
Well, they do.
That's what all the recent

36:27.216 --> 36:29.995
controlling distribution.

36:30.019 --> 36:33.031
Yeah... killing off
your competition.

36:33.055 --> 36:34.833
Exactly.

36:34.857 --> 36:38.103
I mean, the cartels hire
freelancers to do their hits.

36:38.127 --> 36:40.973
The way that the hit men
prove how many they've killed

36:40.997 --> 36:43.041
is with the severed feet
of their victims.

36:43.065 --> 36:44.876
Corporal Collins
is not killing for fun.

36:44.900 --> 36:47.391
No, he was killing for hire.

36:49.805 --> 36:51.516
Then who killed him?

36:51.540 --> 36:52.884
That's easy.

36:52.908 --> 36:54.535
Whose drug dealers
was he taking out?

36:56.612 --> 36:58.056
Gonna have to send you

36:58.080 --> 36:59.558
on field trips
more often, probie.

36:59.582 --> 37:01.193
Though I am glad you're back.

37:01.217 --> 37:02.961
Thanks, Tony.

37:02.985 --> 37:04.396
It's nice to have someone
to talk to

37:04.420 --> 37:05.964
for more than
ten seconds at a time.

37:05.988 --> 37:08.422
Yeah, um... about that.

37:10.226 --> 37:12.671
All right,
I programmed your browser

37:12.695 --> 37:15.440
to auto-next you out of
video chats every ten seconds.

37:15.464 --> 37:16.875
That wasn't nice.

37:16.899 --> 37:18.577
Why would you do
something like that?

37:18.601 --> 37:19.911
I don't know. Why would you

37:19.935 --> 37:21.947
create a fake online profile
last year and make me

37:21.971 --> 37:23.839
fall in love with a girl
that doesn't exist?

37:25.241 --> 37:27.072
Can I get back to you on that?

37:36.318 --> 37:38.582
You gonna tell me why I'm here?

37:41.557 --> 37:45.070
I got ten dead bodies,
all with one thing in common.

37:45.094 --> 37:46.471
Oh, yeah? What's that?

37:46.495 --> 37:48.573
You.

37:48.597 --> 37:50.497
Sit down.

37:53.869 --> 37:57.449
According to the DEA,
they sold drugs for you.

37:57.473 --> 37:59.918
Allegedly.

37:59.942 --> 38:03.742
At least until Corporal Collins
started killing them.

38:06.215 --> 38:08.593
And that's why you killed him.

38:08.617 --> 38:10.812
Doesn't look familiar.

38:12.721 --> 38:14.814
How about that?
That look familiar?

38:19.695 --> 38:21.754
Very nice ring you're wearing.

38:22.998 --> 38:24.142
Any chance that there's still

38:24.166 --> 38:26.157
some of Collins' DNA in that?

38:29.038 --> 38:30.849
Because I know
we've got some of yours

38:30.873 --> 38:32.670
from underneath his fingernails.

38:39.081 --> 38:40.792
You got this wrong.

38:40.816 --> 38:43.528
Collins tried to kill me.

38:43.552 --> 38:46.031
Tried to poison me with
some kind of snake venom.

38:46.055 --> 38:47.632
You don't look poisoned.

38:47.656 --> 38:48.953
'Cause I'm immune.

38:50.493 --> 38:51.970
These aren't just for show.

38:51.994 --> 38:53.805
I own two pythons and a cobra.

38:53.829 --> 38:56.730
I've been bit more times
than I can count.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.580
Two nights ago,
I come home, have a drink.

39:01.604 --> 39:04.416
And the next thing I knew,
I wake up in some truck.

39:04.440 --> 39:05.717
Collins was there.

39:05.741 --> 39:08.353
Clocked him pretty good
with a pipe.

39:08.377 --> 39:10.188
Didn't mean to kill him.
It was an accident.

39:10.212 --> 39:13.375
Was cutting off his feet
an accident, too?

39:17.853 --> 39:19.865
He was killing my dealers.

39:19.889 --> 39:22.000
I had motive to take him out.
Who'd believe that

39:22.024 --> 39:23.902
it was self-defense?
I just tried to make it

39:23.926 --> 39:27.005
look like he was another
serial killer victim.

39:27.029 --> 39:28.740
Who hired him
to take out your dealers?

39:28.764 --> 39:30.342
I don't know.
They weren't local.

39:30.366 --> 39:31.765
Who hired him?!

39:36.038 --> 39:37.949
I think it was
the Reynosa cartel.

39:37.973 --> 39:40.441
They're everywhere now.

39:55.925 --> 39:57.256
Hi, Gibbs.

39:58.494 --> 40:00.172
Hey, Abbs.

40:00.196 --> 40:02.027
Can I come in?

40:03.098 --> 40:05.510
Yeah. You're already in.

40:05.534 --> 40:08.367
Right.

40:19.315 --> 40:20.339
Okay.

40:23.752 --> 40:25.931
It was nice talking to you.

40:25.955 --> 40:26.979
Abbs...

40:29.325 --> 40:31.603
Why are you here?

40:31.627 --> 40:33.527
You know why I'm here.

40:46.075 --> 40:48.220
I matched the bullet
in Pedro Hernandez' head

40:48.244 --> 40:49.973
to your sniper rifle.

40:53.849 --> 40:56.394
You killed him.

40:56.418 --> 40:58.496
In cold blood.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.966
I mean, I know
what he did, Gibbs.

41:00.990 --> 41:05.403
He... He killed your wife
and your daughter.

41:05.427 --> 41:08.225
But, Gibbs...

41:09.431 --> 41:10.809
I know.

41:10.833 --> 41:14.579
Gibbs doesn't
do things like that.

41:14.603 --> 41:16.214
Or-Or-Or does he?

41:16.238 --> 41:18.550
Now I don't know.

41:18.574 --> 41:20.565
I don't know anything.

41:22.611 --> 41:25.423
The only thing that I do know

41:25.447 --> 41:28.348
is that I didn't
find this out by accident.

41:30.185 --> 41:31.563
Rule 40.

41:31.587 --> 41:34.920
"If it seems like someone
is out to get you, they are."

41:37.459 --> 41:40.372
Just...

41:40.396 --> 41:43.729
You have no idea how much
I wish it was yesterday.

41:45.734 --> 41:47.912
I mean, maybe if I could
just close my eyes

41:47.936 --> 41:50.928
and open them again, it will be.

42:03.485 --> 42:06.731
Do you realize the situation
that I'm in now?

42:06.755 --> 42:08.900
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, do you understand

42:08.924 --> 42:11.036
- the choice that I have to make now?
- I know.

42:11.060 --> 42:12.304
Stop saying "I know."

42:12.328 --> 42:13.805
What do you want me to say?

42:13.829 --> 42:17.042
Tell me that I'm wrong.

42:17.066 --> 42:21.379
Tell me that I made a mistake
with the ballistics or...

42:21.403 --> 42:23.394
No.

42:25.841 --> 42:28.286
No, I can't say that.

42:28.310 --> 42:30.822
Then...

42:30.846 --> 42:33.925
tell me how much I've been
like a daughter to you...

42:33.949 --> 42:36.611
and how much you love me.

42:39.521 --> 42:41.900
Will that help?

42:41.924 --> 42:43.915
No.

42:47.730 --> 42:50.995
What I really need
to know, Gibbs...

42:53.001 --> 42:56.014
is if you're going to love me,

42:56.038 --> 42:57.596
no matter what.
