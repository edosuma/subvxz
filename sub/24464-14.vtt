00:10.870 --> 00:13.380
Hurry up, dude! The
show's coming back on!

00:13.610 --> 00:15.190
Hang on, I gotta get my oats.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.850
Dude, use a bowl.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.840
Shut it! I'll eat my oats
however my mouth feels like it.

00:23.180 --> 00:27.080
And now, back to Behind
the Bands with Adrenaline!

00:28.920 --> 00:31.920
Here's Fesner! John Moore! Ricky Grant!

00:31.920 --> 00:35.080
And frontman... Ace Balthazar!

00:35.720 --> 00:37.190
1, 2, 3, 4...!

00:37.190 --> 00:41.920
They were the most epic
band of all time... in 1984!

00:42.060 --> 00:44.220
Yeah. We were pretty
up with our guests...

00:44.340 --> 00:46.240
but it was Ace they came to see.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.730
He was real, man.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.400
I've got an Adrenaline rush,
and I think I'm gonna--!

00:52.400 --> 00:56.460
Crush! Crush! Crush! Crush! Crush!

01:01.540 --> 01:04.489
For Ace, crushing just
wasn't part of the show.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.040
It was a way of life.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.220
I think I'm gonna
- CRUSH!

01:08.220 --> 01:12.620
CRUSH! CRUSH! CRUSH! CRUSH! CRUSH!

01:13.910 --> 01:15.470
Wait. Where's Ace?

01:15.470 --> 01:18.750
CRUSH! CRUSH! CRUSH!

01:21.230 --> 01:23.880
Come on, we've gotta
get outta here! RUN!

01:24.860 --> 01:25.920
When we lost Ace,

01:25.980 --> 01:27.770
we knew the Adrenaline Rush was over.

01:27.950 --> 01:30.620
There'll never be another
performer like Ace. Ever.

01:32.180 --> 01:33.580
- True facts.
- Dude!

01:33.630 --> 01:35.820
I wish we could've seen them play live.

01:35.820 --> 01:38.550
It would've been the
most epic concert ever.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.800
Though he was presumed dead,

01:40.840 --> 01:43.200
Ace's body was never found.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.450
Could Ace be alive and walking among us?

01:46.570 --> 01:49.340
He ain't dead. I seen
him at the shop-mart.

01:49.340 --> 01:52.700
My friend's brother saw
him at the bus station.

01:52.700 --> 01:54.390
I saw him on my Quesadilla.

01:55.110 --> 01:58.690
A recent sighting has
even been captured on film.

01:59.260 --> 02:00.860
That looks like our
house in the background.

02:00.860 --> 02:02.950
Dude, that is our house.

02:02.950 --> 02:04.630
Wait, is that..?

02:05.140 --> 02:07.120
Dude, it's that guy who
thinks he's a knight.

02:07.120 --> 02:10.729
Could this man be the
real Ace Balthazar?

02:10.729 --> 02:12.210
Duuuuuuuude.

02:14.830 --> 02:17.120
Ace Balthazar is in our park!

02:19.280 --> 02:21.990
Dude, I bet if we get him
back together with his band,

02:21.990 --> 02:24.720
They'll play live and
we get backstage passes!

02:24.720 --> 02:26.880
They totally give us backstage passes!

02:26.880 --> 02:29.760
Dude, we got to get him
back together with his band.

02:31.050 --> 02:33.220
Now, to see what you are made of.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.700
Dude, it's him! It's Ace!

02:39.700 --> 02:42.590
Yes it is!

02:42.590 --> 02:44.330
Ace! Ace! Ace! Ace!

02:44.330 --> 02:46.330
Oh, natives of the new world!

02:46.330 --> 02:49.180
Ace, oh man, it's a
honor to meet you, Sir.

02:49.180 --> 02:51.180
Ace? What is this "Ace"?

02:51.180 --> 02:53.820
Dude you are Ace
Balthazar from Adrenaline!

02:53.820 --> 02:56.660
What?! I am not Ace Balthazar!

02:56.660 --> 02:59.750
I am Sir Gabelthorp of Kingdonia!

02:59.750 --> 03:03.060
My quest is to discover the
marvels of the new world!

03:03.060 --> 03:07.730
For instance, to find the tiny artists
that live within this printing device

03:09.480 --> 03:11.310
Dude, there's something
seriously worng with Ace.

03:11.660 --> 03:15.200
I know, I think that bus crush must
had messed up with his memories.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.180
Time to JOG IT then!

03:21.010 --> 03:23.260
What is this music?

03:23.480 --> 03:27.770
How do you have a whole band
of man inside such a small box?

03:27.770 --> 03:29.640
It's not just any band of man,

03:29.770 --> 03:32.100
It's  Adrenaline!

03:32.100 --> 03:34.180
Adrenaline?

03:34.180 --> 03:36.560
I must meet this tiny band of man!

03:36.560 --> 03:37.360
No wait!

03:40.470 --> 03:42.600
Where did the tiny band of man go?

03:42.600 --> 03:46.170
Dude,Ace Balthazar just
trashed our boombox!

03:49.220 --> 03:51.680
Ace, we wanna get you back
together with your old band.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.050
Yeah, we are huge fans.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.920
And we wanna see you perform live!

03:55.360 --> 03:59.890
If pretending to be Ace Balthazar will
get them to accept me then so be it!

03:59.890 --> 04:03.730
Friends, I just remembered
that I am Ace Balthazar!

04:04.300 --> 04:05.370
I knew it!

04:05.370 --> 04:08.160
Now all we gotta do is get you
back together with your old band.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.950
Oh those were the days.

04:13.970 --> 04:17.250
But I wouldn't get to see Ace
walk through our doors right now

04:17.589 --> 04:19.839
There's a guy out here
claiming to be Ace.

04:19.940 --> 04:21.160
Alright, bring him in.

04:22.380 --> 04:26.000
Hello all, It's I ! Ace Balthazar!

04:27.380 --> 04:29.770
Jenkins, please just got these guys out.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.590
No wait, he really is Ace!

04:31.590 --> 04:32.660
Just look at him!

04:35.300 --> 04:36.180
Eh Ricky,

04:36.180 --> 04:38.130
He just kinda look like Ace.

04:38.130 --> 04:40.690
Maybe,but you don't
dress right like him.

04:40.690 --> 04:43.470
Besides, It's a known fact
that Ace died in that crash.

04:43.580 --> 04:46.400
Fesi, play track 4 of Adrena guiden

04:46.480 --> 04:47.360
backwards.

04:48.330 --> 04:54.790
This is Ace Balthazar speaking,
and I were totally dead in a crash.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.020
Don't worry, Ace. We'll change
you back in your old self.

05:00.190 --> 05:02.000
Then they'll believe it's you for sure.

05:03.440 --> 05:06.420
First things first, we need to find
you something that is cool to wear.

05:06.420 --> 05:07.950
What is wrong with my armor?

05:07.950 --> 05:09.180
Dude, burlap isn't cool.

05:09.180 --> 05:11.600
You know what else isn't
cool? Not wearing pants.

05:13.730 --> 05:17.020
If you want people to recognize you, you
gotta start to dressing like your old self.

05:17.830 --> 05:19.920
If it is as your culture dictates,

05:19.990 --> 05:23.000
then I will don the garb
that is necessary to do so.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.290
Whatever, just try the clothes on.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.610
No, No!

05:36.780 --> 05:38.480
I simply will not allow it!

05:38.480 --> 05:41.790
I'll stand for this
artisans to rouge my face.

05:41.790 --> 05:43.790
But to remove my helmet?!

05:43.790 --> 05:45.280
I refuse!

05:45.280 --> 05:47.170
A helomet is a knight's honor!

05:47.170 --> 05:48.730
Well hair is a rock star's honor!

05:48.730 --> 05:50.970
Yeah, man! No hair, no honor.

05:50.970 --> 05:52.970
It's the only way to be a rock star!

05:52.970 --> 05:55.760
Well, If that is your custom,

05:55.760 --> 05:57.090
then so be it.

06:00.330 --> 06:01.770
This's gonna take a while.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.730
Presenting Ace Balthazar!

06:07.380 --> 06:08.720
- Wow!
- Awesome!

06:08.720 --> 06:10.720
Margret and Eileen, this is perfect!

06:10.720 --> 06:14.660
Indeed, I feel thoroughly
transformed into a star of rock.

06:14.950 --> 06:16.790
Well, almost perfect.

06:17.780 --> 06:20.030
This will help you
remember who you really are.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.180
Remarkable!

06:23.310 --> 06:26.430
From tiny band of man
you can hear and see,

06:26.430 --> 06:28.160
what sorcery is this?

06:28.200 --> 06:30.050
No, no more that knight talk man,

06:30.050 --> 06:31.190
just watch the screen.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.680
Describe yourself in one word.

06:35.780 --> 06:37.600
Acetounding.

07:03.730 --> 07:05.960
Oh, it's you blokes again!

07:06.080 --> 07:07.080
Get out!

07:09.230 --> 07:12.430
Aren't you gonna invite
your old band mate inside?

07:12.680 --> 07:13.420
Ace?

07:15.280 --> 07:19.130
I dunno about you guys,but
I've got an Adrenaline rush,

07:19.130 --> 07:21.130
and I think I'm GONNA-

07:21.130 --> 07:27.040
Crush! Crush! Crush!

07:29.520 --> 07:31.890
So will you gonna rock out or what?

07:34.960 --> 07:38.090
Dude, we did it! We're gonna
see the Andrenaline play live!

07:38.320 --> 07:40.010
Crush! Crush! Crush!

07:42.100 --> 07:43.930
I wanna thank all of you for being here,

07:43.930 --> 07:47.120
and I wanna tell you that
tonight, rock history will be made.

07:47.120 --> 07:51.720
Because tonight, after years of
silence, Andrenaline plays again!

07:58.230 --> 08:00.560
I have longed for this moment!

08:02.510 --> 08:04.160
Alright, let's rock!

08:04.160 --> 08:05.500
1, 2, 3, 4!

08:08.160 --> 08:09.280
Ah... What?!

08:18.200 --> 08:21.890
Imposter! This isn't
the real Ace Balthazar!

08:21.890 --> 08:22.880
I am!

08:22.880 --> 08:23.550
Uh-oh.

08:23.550 --> 08:26.390
You! You are a disguise!

08:26.390 --> 08:28.460
But, but...

08:28.460 --> 08:29.840
But nothing!

08:29.840 --> 08:33.620
I'm the real deal here, and
this band is nothing without me

08:33.620 --> 08:34.669
No offense, guys.

08:34.669 --> 08:35.990
Oh yeah, don't worry about it.

08:35.990 --> 08:38.620
Now get off this stage poser!

08:39.620 --> 08:41.190
-Wait, hold on!
-Stop, stop!

08:41.190 --> 08:45.920
We're sorry we thought he was you,it's
just,we really wanna see Andrenaline play live.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.540
Please just let them play.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.930
No! Now get off the stage!

08:52.240 --> 08:56.020
Get off the stage! Get off
the stage! Get off the stage!

08:56.020 --> 08:57.980
Enough! Enough I say!

08:59.040 --> 09:01.990
For years, I have been
fascinated by your culture.

09:01.990 --> 09:07.440
I've worked hard to embrace this as my
own,yet this is how I am to be repaid?

09:08.530 --> 09:10.840
Now hear this, Ace Balthazar!

09:11.050 --> 09:15.490
I've got an Adrenaline rush,
and I think I'm GONNA CRASH!

09:39.200 --> 09:42.960
This crashing...is Acetounding!

09:47.790 --> 09:49.420
I was wrong about you,

09:49.420 --> 09:52.960
Never before have I seen
anyone crushed that way.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.950
That was better than anything
I could have ever done.

09:56.370 --> 09:58.080
Neo Sir Gabelthorp,

09:58.560 --> 10:02.850
I dub thee, the new Ace Balthazar!

10:04.700 --> 10:07.040
Now, take the stage!

10:16.700 --> 10:18.680
Forget it, I'll just do it.

10:19.090 --> 10:20.680
1, 2, 3, 4!

10:23.910 --> 10:27.780
Well at least we got to
see Andrenaline play live!

10:30.960 --> 10:33.080
This music is amazing!

10:33.080 --> 10:34.990
It must be shared!

10:46.490 --> 10:49.470
I have moshed...poorly.

10:49.470 --> 10:53.340
Gabelthorp! Gabelthorp! Gabelthorp!

10:54.170 --> 10:57.500
Dude, Best concert EVER!
