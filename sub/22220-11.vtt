WEBVTT

00:04.088 --> 00:05.874
Crichton:
Whoo! This thing rocks!

00:05.965 --> 00:07.250
Aeryn:
"Rocks"?

00:07.341 --> 00:10.253
Yeah, rocks, Aeryn, as in
"kicks ass."

00:10.344 --> 00:13.211
Oh? Well, I take it that
means you're pleased.

00:13.306 --> 00:15.012
But I'm still not convinced

00:15.099 --> 00:17.932
that installing these Moya
components was a good idea.

00:18.019 --> 00:20.601
Great idea.
Best idea I've had yet.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.395
That's far from a
recommendation.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.814
Pilot, you still receiving us?

00:25.902 --> 00:30.896
Pilot:
Barely. Stellar flare activity
wreaks havoc with communications.

00:30.990 --> 00:34.949
If you keep moving out of the
planet's shadow we'll lose
contact entirely.

00:35.036 --> 00:35.991
Crichton:
Can't be helped, Pilot.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.205
Solar flares are what
I came to see.

00:38.289 --> 00:40.245
Don't worry. We'll be home
in time for dinner.

00:40.333 --> 00:43.120
Be careful, John.
This star is unusually erratic.

00:43.211 --> 00:46.999
Sounds just like Crichton.

00:47.089 --> 00:48.215
( loud boom )

00:48.299 --> 00:51.132
Whoa! There's the lightning.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.005
Make way for the thunder.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.801
( loud boom )

00:57.099 --> 00:59.385
( booming continues)

01:22.291 --> 01:24.748
Pilot:
It's reaching us even here.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.167
We should adjust our orbit.

01:28.297 --> 01:29.127
Zhaan?

01:29.215 --> 01:31.331
Zhaan, are you all right?

01:31.425 --> 01:33.290
Yes, Pilot.

01:33.386 --> 01:36.344
Oh, these radiation levels

01:36.430 --> 01:39.467
are well within Moya's
tolerance, aren't they?

01:39.558 --> 01:41.719
Moya's tolerance, yes.

01:41.811 --> 01:46.430
However, there's still a small
chance that it could affect
her developing child.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.474
Yes, of course.

01:50.569 --> 01:54.232
Take Moya further into the
planet's shadow.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.751
Flight recorder getting
all this?

02:08.838 --> 02:11.545
You mean this retrograde
magnetic recording device?

02:11.632 --> 02:13.543
-Yeah, that.
-Yes.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.626
It was a solar flare, I think
that opened up the wormhole
that brought me here.

02:16.721 --> 02:19.633
That and the slingshot maneuver
l was flying at the time.

02:19.724 --> 02:21.680
What do you call the maneuver
we're doing now?

02:23.561 --> 02:25.222
Slingshot.

02:25.313 --> 02:28.225
Does that mean you're trying to
create the same conditions
to go back?

02:28.316 --> 02:31.149
It's a long shot, but sometimes
long shots pay off, Aeryn.

02:31.235 --> 02:32.441
What now?

02:36.907 --> 02:39.398
Holy mother.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.324
That's a wormhole.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.032
It looks unstable.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.128
It's pulling us in.

02:53.215 --> 02:56.457
Evasive systems! Crichton!

02:56.552 --> 02:59.089
Full reverse thrustersl

02:59.180 --> 03:00.636
Crichton!

03:09.357 --> 03:10.597
Crichton!

03:17.406 --> 03:19.897
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

03:19.992 --> 03:23.029
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

03:23.120 --> 03:25.827
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship.

03:25.915 --> 03:29.248
a living ship full of strange
alien life-forms...

03:29.335 --> 03:30.120
Help me...

03:30.211 --> 03:31.667
Listen, please.

03:31.754 --> 03:33.790
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:33.881 --> 03:37.920
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

03:38.010 --> 03:39.796
...doing everything I can...

03:39.887 --> 03:43.095
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:01.534 --> 04:05.652
Aeryn:
Crichton, look at it.
It isn't stable.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.158
If we don't get away from it
it's going to tear us apart.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.786
Full thrusters. Crichton!

04:10.876 --> 04:13.208
Crichton, are you listening?

04:13.295 --> 04:14.705
Crichton!

04:16.382 --> 04:18.213
Crichton:
Yeah, I got it.

04:28.477 --> 04:31.389
(yawning)

04:31.480 --> 04:35.223
One would think one could grab
a few miserable arns of sleep

04:35.317 --> 04:38.229
without being shaken from
one's bed.

04:38.320 --> 04:43.235
Rygel, why must one always
only think of one?

04:44.410 --> 04:45.650
Pilot, any sign of them?

04:45.744 --> 04:47.325
Not through all the
interference.

04:47.413 --> 04:49.745
Perhaps we should follow their
trajectory and look for them.

04:49.832 --> 04:52.073
D'Argo:
Absolutely not.

04:52.168 --> 04:54.284
Aeryn and Crichton are
on their own.

04:54.378 --> 04:58.587
We said that we'd leave this
miserable planet as soon as
Moya was ready.

04:58.674 --> 05:02.292
Agreed. There's nothing down
there we want anyway.

05:05.097 --> 05:08.339
All right, so there's no reason
for us to stay.

05:12.271 --> 05:13.761
(gasping)

05:16.609 --> 05:19.692
I could think of a reason.

05:33.209 --> 05:34.949
Hmm?Hmm.

05:35.044 --> 05:37.376
She's gone completely fahrbot.

05:37.463 --> 05:43.333
Pilot:
Yes, Delvian females are
unusually sensitive to ionic radiation.

05:43.427 --> 05:46.169
One of the gifts of
the Delvian seek.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.130
It's called a photogasm.

05:49.225 --> 05:50.340
Rygel:
Yech.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.016
I'll get a mop and bucket.

05:53.103 --> 05:56.846
Crichton:
Whoo! Hey, hey, hey, happy
campers! Anybody home?

05:56.941 --> 05:58.056
John, can you hear us?

05:58.150 --> 05:59.356
Yeah, Zhaan, I hear you fine.

05:59.443 --> 06:00.808
Guess what just happened?

06:00.903 --> 06:02.894
We just started a wormhole.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.364
D'Argo:
How nice.

06:04.448 --> 06:07.440
Why don't you get aboard now
so we can leave orbit?

06:07.535 --> 06:10.197
What? D'Argo, obviously,
you didn't hear me.

06:10.287 --> 06:15.577
Read my lips: we just
started a wormhole.

06:15.668 --> 06:17.249
Can't get out of here right now.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.997
Uh, we have a problem.

06:19.088 --> 06:23.172
Pilot, I'm reading a plasma
leak on the starboard
propulsor.

06:23.259 --> 06:24.920
Can you confirm?

06:27.388 --> 06:29.003
Pilot:
Confirmed.

06:29.098 --> 06:30.963
You'd better prepare to
abandon the module.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.423
Do what?

06:32.518 --> 06:34.383
Pilot:
l'll ready the docking web to
pull you and Crichton in.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.389
Aeryn:
Acknowledged. Better put your
helmet on, Crichton.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.596
Whoa, whoa, keep your hand
off that eject button.

06:38.691 --> 06:40.227
No way are we punching out.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.228
You don't have a choice.

06:42.319 --> 06:45.277
Pilot:
You can't bring the module
aboard while it's leaking plasma.

06:45.364 --> 06:48.777
Yeah, we do. Moya can isolate
it in the maintenance bay
while we patch it.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.244
Moya doesn't want to put
her baby at risk.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.659
Nor should she.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.488
Crichton:
Look, guys,

06:55.583 --> 06:58.495
l might've just found
a way home.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.827
D'Argo:
Your home, not ours.

07:00.921 --> 07:05.335
Well, I am not going to trash
my module if there's any
chance to save it.

07:05.426 --> 07:08.418
D'Argo:
There isn't. Stop stalling.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.385
Rygel.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.212
Rygel!

07:12.308 --> 07:14.014
What?

07:14.101 --> 07:17.218
Just before the flare started
you were on the horn down to
the locals, right?

07:17.313 --> 07:19.770
You said you talked to somebody
who's some kind of m-mechanic?

07:19.857 --> 07:22.269
What, it... name of,
uh... Furball.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.977
Ah... Fellow. Ah, Follow.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.027
Something like that.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.651
Furlow.

07:30.743 --> 07:31.903
Right.

07:31.994 --> 07:33.655
Pilot, give me the location
of this Furlow.

07:33.746 --> 07:35.577
Transmitting coordinates.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.245
l forbid this.

07:37.333 --> 07:38.573
Crichton:
You know what, D'Argo?

07:38.667 --> 07:43.127
Sometimes you're a real
pain in the ass.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.874
Crichton...

07:46.467 --> 07:47.832
Crichton!

07:47.926 --> 07:50.417
Pilot, re-establish contact.

07:50.512 --> 07:54.721
I can't. The solar activity has
reduced the range of the comms.

07:55.768 --> 07:57.429
What is a pain in the ass?

07:57.519 --> 08:02.889
Human speak, I believe, for
someone irritating, stubborn,
obnoxious.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.726
Rygel:
A simpleton, a dolt, idiot.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.230
| get the idea.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.562
Moron.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.951
You're with me on this, right?

08:16.038 --> 08:18.154
Oh, now it occurs to you to ask.

08:18.248 --> 08:22.082
Look, sorry, okay?

08:22.169 --> 08:24.376
I got a little caught up.
I thought we were just going
to collect some data.

08:24.463 --> 08:29.002
I had no idea that we'd
actually start a wormhole.

08:29.093 --> 08:31.960
Well, we did. And you were
ready to jump right into it.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.840
No. No, l was not.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.091
I could see it wasn't stable.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.217
What if it had been?
What if it was stable?

08:36.308 --> 08:38.173
What would you have done then?

08:38.268 --> 08:41.226
Flown straight into it without
knowing where you'd come out
the other side,

08:41.313 --> 08:42.598
and you were taking me with you.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.682
Next time, Crichton,
you can fly solo.

08:45.776 --> 08:48.233
Fine, Aeryn. Next time I will.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.356
But right now, we have to
get the module fixed.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.278
No, actually, you need to.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.698
Okay, I need to.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.117
I need your help.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.321
As usual.

09:13.637 --> 09:16.174
( high-pitched beeps )

09:17.057 --> 09:20.345
(rumbling overhead )

09:29.361 --> 09:33.695
(engines roaring)

09:38.245 --> 09:40.201
(steam hissing)

09:44.960 --> 09:47.542
Furlow:
Blown grezz conductor
is my guess.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.666
Maybe an ionized frangle
as well.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.339
Shouldn't be too tough to fix.

09:52.426 --> 09:53.882
How soon?

09:53.969 --> 09:55.300
Hard to say.

09:55.387 --> 09:58.971
Should have it for you
by nightfall, probably.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.264
Are you sure you've
got it contained?

10:01.351 --> 10:03.137
Oh, don't you worry about that.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.968
Old Furlow can handle it.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.679
Everything's going to be just
fine. That's my motto.

10:07.775 --> 10:10.391
No, other way, you dumb welnitz!

10:11.153 --> 10:12.359
Have to tell them everything.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.812
Of course, I've never seen a
spaceship like this before.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.193
Hardly surprising.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.149
Hardly looks spaceworthy.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.236
Primitive alloys,
no hetch drive...

10:22.331 --> 10:25.118
This thing belongs in a
collection, not in space.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.665
Tell you what.

10:26.752 --> 10:29.414
How about I do you favor and
take this thing off your hands?

10:29.505 --> 10:31.541
She's not for sale.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.714
No, ljust need herfixed so
I can get back up there

10:33.801 --> 10:35.962
before these flares
go away entirely.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.294
Think you might be out of luck.

10:38.388 --> 10:41.801
These flares are going to die
down before the day's out.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.678
How soon do you expect
them back?

10:43.769 --> 10:47.637
Regular as clockwork;
every 4.8 cycles.

10:49.525 --> 10:51.857
Five years?!

10:51.944 --> 10:54.936
Look, you're going to have
to speed up the repairs.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.190
What for?

10:56.281 --> 10:58.397
I got to get back up there.
I'm collecting data.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.073
Oh, I see.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.402
You do research into unusual
spatial phenomena, do you?

11:03.497 --> 11:05.328
Has this got anything to
do with the repairs?

11:05.415 --> 11:07.076
Just making conversation.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.668
Don't make conversation.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.333
Fix the module.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.794
Crichton:
Um...

11:12.881 --> 11:15.839
Sorry if we seem a
little pushy.

11:15.926 --> 11:20.044
But we are in a hurry and
you're obviously the best
mechanic on the planet, so...

11:20.138 --> 11:22.515
think maybe you can help us out?

11:22.599 --> 11:26.968
Since you asked so nicely,
I'll see what I can do.

11:27.062 --> 11:31.305
Now, if you'd like to get out
of my way so I can get on
with my work?

11:32.818 --> 11:36.106
By the way, you'll be
needing these.

11:58.302 --> 12:00.258
Nice glasses.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.210
Furlow better be good.

12:02.306 --> 12:04.217
We got to get back up there.

12:04.308 --> 12:06.674
Pilot, can you read us?

12:07.311 --> 12:08.175
Zhaan...

12:08.270 --> 12:09.225
D'Argo?

12:09.313 --> 12:10.723
D'Argo's just going to
have to wait.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.645
No, we're going to have to
tell him something,

12:12.733 --> 12:14.974
like we're going to be stuck on
this dump for longer than
we anticipated.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.353
What's your problem?

12:16.445 --> 12:18.310
You should be dancing
in the streets.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.521
You know, if I figure out a
way to make a wormhole,
lam out of here.

12:20.616 --> 12:25.485
I'm out of your hair
once and for all.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.116
Unless you want to come with me.
You know that offer's
still open.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.195
If you want to think about it.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.531
No, I don't want to
think about it.

12:30.626 --> 12:31.911
-Talk about it.
-No.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.333
Crais:
Attention!

12:33.420 --> 12:35.832
There are fugitives among you.

12:35.923 --> 12:41.293
Fugitives that can be worth a
great deal to any one of you.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.341
What is that?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.794
It's a "wanted" beacon.

12:43.889 --> 12:48.132
I am Captain Bialar Crais and
I am offering a substantial
reward

12:48.226 --> 12:53.220
to anyone who can assist us
in the recapture of three
escaped prisoners.

12:53.315 --> 12:54.395
Three?

12:54.483 --> 12:55.643
The first...

12:55.734 --> 12:59.272
is a Luxan male named
Ka D'Argo.

12:59.363 --> 13:03.572
The second, a Delvian female
named Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan.

13:03.659 --> 13:07.902
The third is a Hynerian
who styles himself as
Rygel the Sixteenth.

13:07.996 --> 13:13.161
These three fugitives from
Peacekeeper custody have
violated their parole.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.242
I know why I'm not there;
Crais wants to kill me himself.

13:15.337 --> 13:16.326
Why aren't you there?

13:16.421 --> 13:19.413
Oh, I think I might
have an answer.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.003
Alien male:
You!

13:28.225 --> 13:30.261
(alien snarling)

13:30.352 --> 13:32.138
Alien:
Get away from there!

13:32.229 --> 13:33.514
( beeping )

13:35.440 --> 13:37.226
Crichton:
Who the hell is this?

13:37.317 --> 13:39.308
No idea.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.150
Let me handle it.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.570
Who are you?

13:43.657 --> 13:46.615
Have you come in search
of the fugitives?

13:46.702 --> 13:48.238
We are just visitors here.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.284
We have no interest
in fugitives.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.737
(growling):
She's lying.

13:51.832 --> 13:55.199
No, we're just curious about
this beacon here.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.875
Is this your female?

13:57.963 --> 13:59.874
lam no one's female.

13:59.965 --> 14:01.830
( snarling )

14:02.300 --> 14:04.427
(growling)

14:06.430 --> 14:08.136
(growling)

14:09.599 --> 14:12.466
Not your female, hmm?

14:12.561 --> 14:15.974
Then you won't miss her.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.149
(snarling growl)

14:21.570 --> 14:23.401
Back off!

14:23.488 --> 14:26.195
Get that weapon out of my face
before I feed it to you.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.819
( snarling )

14:29.119 --> 14:31.451
Now, you tell your bitch
to let my female go.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.278
(questioning snarl)

14:35.417 --> 14:38.955
Then this female is your mate.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.035
One of them.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.119
( snarling )

14:41.214 --> 14:42.954
Now turn her loose!

14:43.050 --> 14:44.915
( snorting )

14:50.432 --> 14:51.797
Crichton:
You!

14:51.892 --> 14:55.305
You keep your damn mouth shut
unless I tell you to speak.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.351
(approving snarl)

14:59.357 --> 15:01.063
Hey!

15:01.151 --> 15:04.985
Now, who are you and what do
you want with the fugitives?

15:05.072 --> 15:08.781
We are Vorcarion Blood Trackers.

15:08.867 --> 15:11.153
The best.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.992
Second best.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.665
( snarling )

15:19.753 --> 15:21.584
l'm Butch.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.286
This is Sundance.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.872
We're the Hole In The Sky Gang.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.344
Butch.

15:31.431 --> 15:35.265
And Sundance.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.844
I am Rorf.

15:38.939 --> 15:39.724
Worf?

15:39.815 --> 15:41.271
Rorf!

15:41.358 --> 15:47.103
And this is my mate, Rorg.

15:47.197 --> 15:52.408
Well, Rorf, you can forget
about the fugitives.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.234
Sundance, rip out that beacon.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.492
I don't want any other idiots
seeing it and getting
a bright idea.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.619
'Cause that bounty
belongs to me.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.702
( snarling )

16:07.926 --> 16:09.712
Pilot:
Solar flares are still making

16:09.803 --> 16:12.135
long-range communication with
the planet impossible.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.678
We've waited for Crichton
long enough.

16:13.765 --> 16:14.515
Where's Zhaan?

16:14.599 --> 16:15.930
( scoffs )

16:16.017 --> 16:19.225
She's on the terrace,
soaking up solar flares.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.894
At a time like this?

16:21.982 --> 16:23.188
Zhaan.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.099
Zhaan.

16:29.239 --> 16:30.604
Zhaan!

16:35.579 --> 16:39.743
Zhaan:
Oh... let us never leave
this place.

16:42.460 --> 16:45.793
Rygel:
ldon't think you want
to go after her.

16:45.881 --> 16:49.669
She said something about
leaving her clothes behind.

16:50.594 --> 16:52.004
I've had enough of this.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.632
The frell with Crichton's
precious module.

16:54.723 --> 16:58.056
I'm going down to that planet
and drag them both back
here myself.

16:58.143 --> 17:00.930
Glad I could be of some help.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.305
Crichton:
So, what makes you think the
fugitives are anywhere near here?

17:05.400 --> 17:10.770
Rorf:
The Leviathan ship they stole
was sighted in a system not far from here.

17:10.864 --> 17:14.607
We think this will be their
next stop.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.526
Any more of you on the way?

17:18.622 --> 17:21.739
Well, there could be.

17:21.833 --> 17:26.293
The wanted beacons were
on several planets.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.918
So why do you ask?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.470
Just wondering...

17:37.557 --> 17:41.345
how many more bounty hunters
out of luck because these
fugitives are mine.

17:41.436 --> 17:44.269
( both snarling )

17:44.356 --> 17:46.938
Knock it off!

17:51.696 --> 17:56.190
What do you know about Luxans
or Hynerians or Delvians?

17:56.284 --> 17:57.319
(questioning grunt)

17:57.410 --> 18:02.325
The beacon contained
some information.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.406
Crichton:
The beacon is useless.

18:04.501 --> 18:08.870
It doesn't tell you these
fugitives won't be taken
without a lot of blood spilled.

18:11.508 --> 18:12.623
(both laughing)

18:12.717 --> 18:15.174
Crichton:
Yeah, well, I don't.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.422
Not my own.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.178
How good are you two?

18:22.269 --> 18:23.634
( snarls softly)

18:23.728 --> 18:26.640
'Cause I might be willing
to cut you in.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.187
You help me capture the
prisoners and I'll...

18:31.278 --> 18:34.065
split the bounty, 70-30.

18:41.955 --> 18:46.619
70... 40!

18:47.460 --> 18:48.620
80...

18:48.712 --> 18:50.373
40.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.539
You in or out?

19:02.309 --> 19:04.766
Are we in?

19:04.853 --> 19:06.844
For now, hmm?

19:06.938 --> 19:08.849
(laughing)

19:10.358 --> 19:13.145
How long do you think your
ruse is going to work?

19:13.236 --> 19:14.146
It doesn't have to last long,

19:14.237 --> 19:17.195
only long enough for the
module to get fixed.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.364
You know, you're taking
this pretty well.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.692
I figured you'd be killing
yourself by now.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.323
It's necessary.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.200
What made you think of it?

19:26.291 --> 19:28.031
It was a hunch.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.617
My Dad had a couple
of Dobermans.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.704
Dogs.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.959
They're pack animals.

19:36.051 --> 19:41.136
The biggest, baddest dog gets
to be the Alpha male,
the leader.

19:41.222 --> 19:44.760
Well, compared to the
Vorcarion, you're neither the
biggest nor the baddest.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.967
Yeah, well, they don't
know that.

19:47.062 --> 19:50.225
Any sign of submission
and you're lunch.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.351
I showed no sign of submission.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.273
You didn't have to.
You're a female.

19:55.904 --> 19:58.737
Sorry. I don't make the rules.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.815
You certainly seem familiar
with them.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.650
( beeping )

20:03.745 --> 20:07.237
Crais:
Your personal encoding sequence
is accepted.

20:07.332 --> 20:12.827
Officer Aeryn Sun, Special
Commando, lcarion Company,
Pleisar Regiment.

20:12.921 --> 20:15.253
currently absent without leave.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.830
Crais is sending you
love letters?

20:16.925 --> 20:18.540
I suspected as much.

20:18.635 --> 20:21.422
You have committed
numerous acts of treason.

20:21.513 --> 20:24.346
You cannot hope to
avoid us forever.

20:24.432 --> 20:27.390
You will be captured. You will
face trial and punishment.

20:27.477 --> 20:33.393
Your one hope of avoiding this
fate is to accept my
conditional amnesty.

20:33.483 --> 20:36.190
Abandon the human criminal.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.359
Return the Leviathan.

20:38.446 --> 20:43.190
Surrender Ka D'Argo, Pa'u
Zotoh Zhaan and Dominar
Rygel Sixteen.

20:43.284 --> 20:52.579
Comply and you will retire,
honorably, with your commission
fully restored.

20:54.921 --> 20:59.210
You have my oath as
a Peacekeeper.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.460
Yeah, well, we know what
that's worth.

21:04.222 --> 21:05.632
Come on.

21:05.723 --> 21:08.590
Let's light a fire under Furlow
so we can ditch these dogs

21:08.685 --> 21:11.301
before the flares go entirely.

21:17.902 --> 21:22.191
Hey, you're not taking
him seriously.

21:23.324 --> 21:26.157
| always take him seriously.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.237
Pilot, I've landed near
the city.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.904
(sniffing loudly)

22:06.201 --> 22:08.237
(sniffing continues)

22:08.328 --> 22:10.239
That way.

23:36.874 --> 23:38.739
Drop your weapon...

23:38.835 --> 23:40.450
now.

23:44.215 --> 23:47.002
Excellent advice. Do it!

23:47.844 --> 23:49.334
(groaning)

23:54.017 --> 23:57.225
I may have a buyer
who's interested.

23:57.312 --> 23:59.394
I'll let you know.

24:06.237 --> 24:10.571
Turns out the plasma injectors
are blown, too.

24:10.658 --> 24:15.322
Yourjunkpile's going to need a
lot more help than I thought.

24:15.413 --> 24:17.654
But you can fix it, right?

24:17.749 --> 24:21.241
You know, you'd really be
better offjust letting me
take it for scrap.

24:21.336 --> 24:24.078
No chance. This is the second
time you've offered to buy it.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.207
What's the deal?

24:25.298 --> 24:26.663
Funny thing.

24:26.758 --> 24:30.797
Some of the parts show signs of
brell phase distortion.

24:30.887 --> 24:35.256
Almost like it'd been close
to a proto-wormhole.

24:39.771 --> 24:41.261
Proto-wormhole?

24:42.231 --> 24:45.598
What do you know about
wormholes?

24:45.693 --> 24:50.278
Just that they're theoretically
possible but no one's ever
actually found one.

24:50.365 --> 24:53.198
Yeah, that's what I
always thought.

24:53.284 --> 24:58.028
Me, too, until I picked up
bursts of unusual gravity waves

24:58.122 --> 25:02.456
not long ago in the upper
bonosphere.

25:02.543 --> 25:07.378
Sure looked like a wormhole or
at least the beginnings of one.

25:07.465 --> 25:11.003
Well, if you're right then I
really should get back up there

25:11.094 --> 25:13.130
and get some more
readings, right?

25:13.221 --> 25:14.336
Of course.

25:14.430 --> 25:17.172
For your research.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.427
You know, a good-looking
guy like you

25:19.519 --> 25:23.353
shouldn't be getting around in
a pile of old junk like that.

25:23.439 --> 25:27.978
Just so happens I recently come
by a secondhand Prowler

25:28.069 --> 25:29.400
might interest you.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.398
A Prowler?

25:33.032 --> 25:34.738
Stay with the module.

25:52.677 --> 25:54.338
Crichton:
Bonehead.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.295
(growling)

25:57.390 --> 25:59.676
Bonehead.

26:01.978 --> 26:04.640
Good. You didn't screw up.

26:04.731 --> 26:07.222
Hand him over and head after
the other two.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.693
And leave him in your hands?

26:09.777 --> 26:13.895
No. We shall interrogate
him together.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.981
He can lead us to the Hynerian
and the Delvian.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.155
Yes.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.325
Who the hell do you think
is in charge here?

26:19.412 --> 26:20.822
I will kill you, Crichton!

26:20.913 --> 26:21.572
(growling)

26:21.664 --> 26:23.575
(groaning)

26:26.127 --> 26:27.287
Crichton?

26:27.378 --> 26:29.334
Your name's Crichton?

26:29.422 --> 26:32.209
Yeah. Butch Crichton.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.266
(growling)

26:52.570 --> 26:55.653
Crichton:
It doesn't matter what
you do to a Luxan.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.230
He won't talk.

26:57.325 --> 26:58.280
Hmm?

26:58.367 --> 27:03.862
Well, it won't hurt to try.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.698
(laughing)

27:06.793 --> 27:09.535
It won't hurt us to try.

27:12.673 --> 27:16.165
Oh, his hide is thick.

27:16.260 --> 27:21.345
Ah, but I'll bet these
are sensitive.

27:21.432 --> 27:24.720
Crichton:
and I'll bet it's useless.

27:24.811 --> 27:28.269
Rorf:
Don't you want to find out where
the other two fugitives are?

27:28.356 --> 27:31.314
They probably aren't even
on the planet.

27:31.400 --> 27:35.484
Then we'll find out the orbital
coordinates of their ship.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.233
Tell us.

27:38.324 --> 27:41.487
Where are they?

27:44.789 --> 27:46.199
Stop!

27:47.166 --> 27:48.542
You're making him bleed!

27:48.626 --> 27:50.162
Your point being?

27:50.253 --> 27:54.212
My point being, it's dangerous
for a Luxan.

27:54.298 --> 27:55.287
You see how dark the blood is?

27:55.383 --> 27:56.714
You can't keep cutting
him like that.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.257
You have to stimulate
the blood flow,

27:58.344 --> 28:00.551
Increase it till the blood
runs clear.

28:00.638 --> 28:03.175
Or... what?

28:03.266 --> 28:07.259
Or it turns toxic and he
dies of blood shock.

28:09.564 --> 28:13.227
Crais wants these
prisoners alive.

28:13.317 --> 28:17.276
The beacon didn't specify
"alive."

28:19.907 --> 28:22.114
(growling)

28:22.201 --> 28:23.657
The one I saw did.

28:27.498 --> 28:30.205
Who's calling the shots
here, Pluto?

28:30.293 --> 28:33.205
Why are you protecting him?!

28:33.296 --> 28:35.082
Hmmﬂ

28:35.172 --> 28:39.336
Perhaps the two of you are
secret allies.

28:39.427 --> 28:40.667
Hmm?

28:40.761 --> 28:42.342
Eli—fig 7?

28:42.430 --> 28:46.514
Perhaps the fugitives have
offered you more than the bounty

28:46.601 --> 28:49.092
to keep them safe from
the hunters.

28:49.186 --> 28:53.350
( growls )

28:56.235 --> 29:01.446
You think I care about this
piece of meat?

29:01.532 --> 29:07.118
What I'm saying is, he is
worthless to us dead,

29:07.204 --> 29:10.617
and questioning him is
a waste of time!

29:13.294 --> 29:15.205
Then prove it.

29:15.296 --> 29:16.957
Hmm?

29:17.048 --> 29:20.256
Waste a little time.

29:35.024 --> 29:36.264
You listen to me.

29:36.359 --> 29:39.476
You listen to me, you
tattooed freak.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.947
( growls )

29:42.031 --> 29:44.192
I don't care if you talk
to me or not.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.990
You can die right now or you
can hold on as long as you can.

29:47.078 --> 29:51.788
But either way unless you do
what I tell you to do...

29:52.375 --> 29:54.286
it's over.

29:54.835 --> 29:56.917
You understand me?

29:58.339 --> 29:59.624
Hmm?

30:02.969 --> 30:04.505
Damn you anyway.

30:06.180 --> 30:10.139
( Rorf and Rorg cackling )

30:10.893 --> 30:13.259
He's passed out.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.604
A waste of time.

30:21.696 --> 30:24.608
Rorf:
The blood is clear.

30:24.699 --> 30:27.532
He's alive...

30:27.618 --> 30:29.279
at least...

30:29.370 --> 30:30.906
for now.

30:36.419 --> 30:38.501
How much longer is this
going to take?

30:38.587 --> 30:42.171
Twice as blotching long as
if you weren't here.

30:42.258 --> 30:44.749
Why don't you go for a nice
little walk outside?

30:44.844 --> 30:46.755
Take in some of the sights.

30:46.846 --> 30:48.177
What sights?

30:48.264 --> 30:50.095
Well, if you go straight
out that way

30:50.182 --> 30:52.844
there's a truly outstanding
expanse of sand.

30:52.935 --> 30:54.175
Sand,eh?

30:54.270 --> 30:56.056
Just as much as you could want.

30:56.147 --> 30:57.637
There are plenty of things
I want at the moment.

30:57.732 --> 30:59.393
Sand isn't one of them.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.361
What's he doing?

31:09.452 --> 31:12.865
Recalibrating the
retro-thrusters, probably.

31:12.955 --> 31:14.240
No. He isn't.

31:14.331 --> 31:17.073
He's trying to access the
flight recorder.

31:18.335 --> 31:21.202
Hey! Get the frell away
from that!

32:32.409 --> 32:33.990
Yoo-hoo!

32:39.208 --> 32:41.164
( beeping )

32:42.336 --> 32:44.793
Whoever he was, he's dead now.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.131
You okay?

32:46.215 --> 32:47.751
(gasps )

32:47.842 --> 32:50.254
I can't see.

32:57.184 --> 33:00.347
Ah, Rygel. | feel renewed.

33:00.437 --> 33:03.429
Oh, Zhaan, are you
fully clothed?

33:04.692 --> 33:07.183
I'm not wearing a scrap.

33:07.278 --> 33:10.145
I'm as nude as a newborn baby.

33:10.239 --> 33:16.109
Then go away and don't insult
my eyes with your naked,
blue extremities.

33:16.203 --> 33:19.161
Which ones in particular
don't you like?

33:19.248 --> 33:20.408
Show them to me.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.285
No, thank you.

33:23.544 --> 33:25.626
Aah! Help! Help!

33:25.713 --> 33:30.833
A mad Delvian exhibitionist
is-is forcing herself
on me, visually!

33:30.926 --> 33:32.541
( blows )

33:32.636 --> 33:35.127
Oh, very funny.

33:35.222 --> 33:37.338
Did you come here just to
irritate me?

33:37.433 --> 33:39.344
No. Actually, I was looking
for D'Argo.

33:39.435 --> 33:41.801
Well, you look down
on the planet.

33:41.896 --> 33:44.308
He went to retrieve
Crichton and Aeryn.

33:44.398 --> 33:46.229
By force if necessary.

33:46.317 --> 33:48.399
Oh, I'll have to go
and find him.

33:48.485 --> 33:50.976
D'Argo can be very impetuous.

33:51.071 --> 33:53.107
Quick to anger.

33:53.199 --> 33:55.155
Yes, please go.

33:55.242 --> 33:58.075
Pilot, prepare the shuttle
for launch.

34:01.749 --> 34:04.161
Why don't you just
take it easy?

34:04.251 --> 34:06.242
It's only temporary, probably.

34:06.337 --> 34:07.326
Probably?

34:07.421 --> 34:08.410
Sure.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.712
Sixty percent chance
of recovery.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.175
Seventy. Eighty, even.

34:12.259 --> 34:13.840
How soon?

34:13.928 --> 34:16.419
Don't tell me, you're not a
pleebig ocular physician.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.602
( sniffing )

34:28.692 --> 34:31.229
A new scent.

34:31.320 --> 34:32.230
Yes.

34:32.321 --> 34:35.233
Very subtle.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.400
( growls )

34:39.495 --> 34:41.861
Delvian.

35:16.699 --> 35:18.155
We got a problem.

35:18.242 --> 35:21.200
D'Argo came down here and the
bloodhounds have him. Look...

35:21.287 --> 35:22.447
"Look."

35:22.538 --> 35:23.744
Right now, I don't look at all.

35:23.831 --> 35:25.662
What are you talking about?

35:28.794 --> 35:30.125
You can't see?

35:30.212 --> 35:33.875
Don't worry. It's... it's only
temporary, probably.

35:33.966 --> 35:36.958
Sure. 60% chance of recovery.

35:37.052 --> 35:39.259
70, 80, even.

35:39.346 --> 35:40.961
Aeryn, how did this happen?

35:41.056 --> 35:42.262
Another bounty hunter showed up.

35:42.349 --> 35:44.055
Another one?

35:44.143 --> 35:48.136
She, uh, caught a solar flare
in the face as she was
taking him out.

35:48.230 --> 35:50.687
Don't help me, Crichton!

35:50.774 --> 35:54.016
You can't look after yourself,
not right now.

35:54.111 --> 35:56.067
So stop acting like a
bad-ass Peacekeeper.

35:56.155 --> 35:59.272
Ex-Peacekeeper. Actually.

35:59.366 --> 36:00.867
Crichton:
I know.

36:06.707 --> 36:07.947
Furlow!

36:08.042 --> 36:11.955
We're going to need that
module, soon!

36:27.311 --> 36:30.599
(grunting)

37:02.096 --> 37:04.838
( sniffing )

37:06.683 --> 37:10.267
The scent... it's gone.

37:15.275 --> 37:19.314
Oh, help me. This is
hardly the time.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.283
Rorg!

37:31.375 --> 37:33.331
Rorg, let's go.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.542
(whistling)

37:41.510 --> 37:45.173
Huh, some days you get lucky.

37:45.264 --> 37:47.380
D'Argo, wake up.

37:50.727 --> 37:51.637
Damn.

37:51.728 --> 37:53.514
You brought it. Good.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.347
Now, I can start on your
sensitive appendages.

37:56.442 --> 37:57.898
Look, we don't have time
for this!

37:57.985 --> 37:59.350
This isn't supposed
to be happening.

37:59.445 --> 38:00.434
You're not even supposed
to be down here.

38:00.529 --> 38:02.315
Neither are you.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.481
| just wanted to go home.

38:05.576 --> 38:07.942
Well, no matter to the cost
to the rest of us.

38:08.036 --> 38:10.493
What? Oh, right. Remind me.

38:10.581 --> 38:13.038
Who chopped off Pilot's arm so
he could get a return ticket?

38:13.125 --> 38:14.160
(grunts in anger)

38:14.251 --> 38:16.207
Huh? No, it wasn't me.

38:16.295 --> 38:18.331
l was too busy saving your ass.

38:18.422 --> 38:21.630
Too busy keeping your
deepest family secrets.

38:21.717 --> 38:24.254
Shall I chronicle the rest
of that relationship?

38:24.344 --> 38:25.208
Relationship?

38:25.304 --> 38:26.259
Oh, we have a relationship.

38:26.346 --> 38:27.472
No wonder you want to kill me.

38:27.556 --> 38:28.591
I once thought...

38:28.682 --> 38:29.546
Thought what?

38:29.641 --> 38:30.801
No, no, no, no.

38:30.893 --> 38:33.134
Thank me tomorrow.
I saved your ass today.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.479
You tortured me.

38:34.563 --> 38:35.518
I saved you!

38:35.606 --> 38:37.221
You know what?

38:37.316 --> 38:40.433
l have no idea what goes on
in that tiny little brain of
yours, D'Argo.

38:40.527 --> 38:43.269
l have no idea why you do
anything that you do.

38:43.363 --> 38:48.198
Catch a clue, pal, cause I'm
tired of sticking my hand out
only to have you snap at it.

38:48.285 --> 38:52.824
Every time I let down my guard,
you disappoint me.

38:52.915 --> 38:54.780
Sorry.

38:54.875 --> 38:56.490
I'm only human.

38:59.129 --> 39:03.088
You look so much like a
Peacekeeper I often forget.

39:06.094 --> 39:07.959
Is that it?

39:10.474 --> 39:13.466
Or do you always have to
be the Alpha male?

39:13.560 --> 39:15.221
Alpha male?

39:15.312 --> 39:17.303
Yeah, the big shot.

39:17.397 --> 39:20.389
The one with the big britches,
the leader.

39:21.860 --> 39:25.273
You are so... childish.

39:27.533 --> 39:30.195
You are selfish.

39:30.285 --> 39:32.697
Can be. What about you?
Selfish?

39:33.205 --> 39:34.570
Sometimes.

39:34.665 --> 39:37.281
I ever come after you
with a weapon?

39:41.922 --> 39:44.914
This isn't going to work,
is it?

39:45.008 --> 39:47.920
We're never going to
be friends.

39:48.011 --> 39:50.388
Friendship is a lot to ask.

39:55.269 --> 39:57.134
Then how about respect?

39:58.647 --> 40:01.013
We can be allies.

40:05.279 --> 40:08.863
Warriors on Earth did this to
show that they weren't
holding weapons.

40:28.302 --> 40:31.214
( beeps and clicks )

40:36.685 --> 40:40.678
Hey, I feel for you.
I really do.

40:40.772 --> 40:46.768
Must be hard for someone as
invulnerable as you

40:46.862 --> 40:50.104
to have to rely on the
kindness of strangers.

40:50.198 --> 40:54.487
You really have no intention of
fixing this module anytime soon
have you, Furlow?

40:54.578 --> 40:56.489
Well, |...

40:56.580 --> 41:00.914
don't normally have quite so
many bounty hunters getting
in my way.

41:01.001 --> 41:03.708
Look, I don't know what
your game is,

41:03.795 --> 41:08.038
but I think we might be able
to make a deal.

41:10.010 --> 41:11.090
Do tell.

41:11.178 --> 41:14.841
You any good at
cyber-manipulation?

41:16.308 --> 41:18.344
I'll take Aeryn back to
Moya in the Prowler.

41:18.435 --> 41:20.596
Works for me. I'll meet you
back at the ship.

41:23.940 --> 41:25.396
This way.

41:27.235 --> 41:28.611
(both yelling)

41:28.695 --> 41:30.276
Move it!

41:36.244 --> 41:39.077
Well, this is a good spot.
We're totally pinned down.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.745
Not if I can help it.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.209
(growling)

41:48.632 --> 41:49.587
Where's the Prowler?

41:49.675 --> 41:51.290
Outside the city.

41:58.225 --> 41:59.886
Aeryn's at a place
called Furlow's.

41:59.976 --> 42:02.262
It's across the square.
Think you can make it there?

42:02.354 --> 42:05.187
I will not abandon you
in battle.

42:10.195 --> 42:13.483
D'Argo, next time you pick
a place to hide, pick one
with a backdoor.

42:13.573 --> 42:15.859
I did not pick this
place to hide.

42:23.250 --> 42:24.456
They're trying to
outmaneuver us.

42:24.543 --> 42:26.033
Give me your weapon.
l'll cover you.

42:26.128 --> 42:27.288
At least you can get
out of here.

42:27.379 --> 42:31.622
Crichton, you are my ally.

42:31.717 --> 42:33.673
I will not abandon you.

42:38.265 --> 42:39.345
Great.

42:39.433 --> 42:41.298
So we can be buried together.

42:43.186 --> 42:44.801
l'll deal with this.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.227
Crichton! No!

42:46.314 --> 42:49.977
Who the hell do you think
you're shooting at?!

42:54.364 --> 42:55.820
(laughing)

43:00.912 --> 43:04.871
So you switched sides,
have you Crichton?

43:04.958 --> 43:09.292
Yeah, well, you know soldiers
of fortune and all that
always...

43:09.379 --> 43:11.711
open to a higher bid.

43:14.259 --> 43:16.215
Crichton's mate.

43:26.021 --> 43:27.431
What the...

43:32.110 --> 43:33.225
D'Argo!

43:33.320 --> 43:35.356
Cover me.

43:35.447 --> 43:37.312
( growls )

43:50.504 --> 43:51.994
What the hell are you doing?

43:52.088 --> 43:53.794
Shh. Watch.

43:53.882 --> 43:56.168
I am Captain Bialar Crais.

43:56.259 --> 44:00.798
The Peacekeeper Command Carrier
assigned to recover the three
escaped prisoners

44:00.889 --> 44:03.301
has been called home on
other business.

44:03.391 --> 44:07.430
Therefore, the reward offer for
the fugitives has been
officially withdrawn.

44:09.981 --> 44:11.517
No reward?

44:11.608 --> 44:14.816
Then is there any point in
continuing this?

44:15.987 --> 44:17.852
Are you hungry?

44:21.785 --> 44:23.491
Not that hungry.

44:23.578 --> 44:24.613
Good.

44:24.704 --> 44:27.696
They're all yours, Butch.

44:28.166 --> 44:29.326
Come on.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.118
How'd you do that?

44:33.213 --> 44:35.078
Furlow did the reprogramming.

44:35.173 --> 44:36.709
I came up with the idea.

44:39.344 --> 44:41.209
Great idea.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.716
Best I've had yet?

44:43.807 --> 44:46.469
Yeah. Best idea yet.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.175
D'Argo!

44:48.270 --> 44:51.182
I got to get back to Furlow's
before these flares are
gone entirely.

44:51.273 --> 44:53.730
No, John, they've stopped.

44:55.318 --> 44:57.183
What?

44:57.279 --> 44:58.689
You sure?

44:58.780 --> 45:01.396
If they hadn't, l'd,
uh... well, I...

45:03.201 --> 45:04.941
I'd still be indisposed.

45:09.499 --> 45:12.206
There'll be other stars with
flare activity, John.

45:12.294 --> 45:13.875
We'll find them.

45:13.962 --> 45:16.419
So close.

45:26.141 --> 45:28.257
Module's ready.

45:28.351 --> 45:29.602
How's the vision?

45:29.686 --> 45:33.474
Oh, it's blurry, but it's
definitely better.

45:37.235 --> 45:39.442
Listen, Aeryn...

45:40.947 --> 45:42.187
Crais's offer of amnesty.

45:42.282 --> 45:44.739
You're not seriously
considering it, are you?

45:44.826 --> 45:47.317
You don't think he'd keep his
word, do you?

45:47.412 --> 45:52.281
I believe he would restore my
commission and give me
honorable retirement.

45:53.293 --> 45:57.332
But, what he means by honorable
retirement

45:57.422 --> 46:01.586
is a radiation-induced brain
fever to bring on the
living death.

46:04.804 --> 46:09.343
Well, if you knew the offer
was bogus, why did you
even listen to it?

46:09.434 --> 46:13.177
Because it was nice, just for
a moment, to believe it
was genuine.

46:13.271 --> 46:16.434
That I could go back.

46:19.069 --> 46:21.276
I better run a, um...
preflight check.

46:21.363 --> 46:23.854
No, no. Rest your eyes.
I'll take care of this.

46:23.949 --> 46:25.359
Actually...

46:25.450 --> 46:27.281
Crichton, l, um...

46:27.369 --> 46:31.157
l have a debt with Furlow
that I can't honor.

46:31.247 --> 46:36.332
So, I'd really appreciate it if
you would settle the account.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.666
Okay.

46:44.219 --> 46:45.880
Furlow.

46:47.138 --> 46:48.423
About the bill.

46:48.515 --> 46:53.600
It's all there. Parts, labor,
overtime, goggle rental.

46:53.687 --> 46:56.178
Goggle rental?

46:56.272 --> 46:59.264
Okay, I'll throw in
the goggles.

47:00.443 --> 47:02.479
You need any food cubes?

47:03.363 --> 47:05.319
I beg your pardon?

47:07.450 --> 47:09.987
I can't pay this.

47:10.078 --> 47:12.239
Then we have a problem.

47:12.330 --> 47:14.116
Unless, of course,
there's, uh...

47:14.207 --> 47:16.914
something else of value
you have to offer...

47:17.002 --> 47:22.292
and I don't mean your
charming smile.

47:22.382 --> 47:25.419
You know, the ability to create
a stable wormhole,

47:25.510 --> 47:28.843
travel through space and
time would be...

47:28.930 --> 47:31.262
incredibly...

47:32.183 --> 47:33.263
Profitable.

47:33.351 --> 47:35.216
Probably.

47:35.854 --> 47:37.594
Deal.

47:37.689 --> 47:40.180
l'll download you a copy of the
data as soon as | get back
aboard the ship.

47:40.275 --> 47:43.233
Exclusive rights or
there's no deal.

47:43.319 --> 47:45.184
What?

47:46.239 --> 47:48.150
No. No.

47:48.241 --> 47:52.200
That-that data may be my only
ticket home.

47:52.287 --> 47:57.873
Well, of course, you're welcome
to stay here and be part of an
exciting experiment.

47:57.959 --> 48:01.292
I can't stay here, Furlow.
I got to keep moving.

48:01.379 --> 48:06.123
There's probably half a dozen
bounty hunters on the way
here right now.

48:06.217 --> 48:09.835
Well, then you really
have a problem.

48:22.734 --> 48:24.395
The data.

48:29.741 --> 48:32.448
I can start from scratch.

48:33.536 --> 48:36.619
Pleasure doing business
with you.

48:36.706 --> 48:38.321
Hey, Furlow?

48:39.250 --> 48:41.286
Five years from now.

48:41.377 --> 48:44.289
I'll be waiting for you at the
end of that wormhole.

48:46.424 --> 48:50.258
You remember now any time you
need some repair work done

48:50.345 --> 48:52.336
you know where to come.

48:57.769 --> 49:01.808
You sure you don't want
that thing detailed?
