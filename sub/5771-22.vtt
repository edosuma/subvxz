NEW YORK CITY
IS THE BEST CITY IN THE WORLD,

00:04.372 --> 00:05.539
BECAUSE EVEN WHEN
YOUR COWORKERS

00:05.573 --> 00:07.341
ARE HAVING AN INCREDIBLY
BORING CONVERSATION

00:07.375 --> 00:09.210
ABOUT STREET MIMES...

00:09.243 --> 00:10.211
(Danny)
MIMES DON'T EVEN TALK.

00:10.244 --> 00:11.312
(Mindy)
YOU CAN HAPPEN UPON

00:11.345 --> 00:15.416
AN INTERESTING STRANGER
ON THE SUBWAY.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.718
[subway alert beeps]

00:17.751 --> 00:19.387
YOU DONE EYE-BANGING
THAT GUY?

00:19.420 --> 00:21.155
WHAT?
NO, I WASN'T.

00:21.189 --> 00:22.256
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
SMILE THIS MUCH

00:22.290 --> 00:24.692
SINCE YOU FOUND OUT YOU WERE
YOUNGER THAN KATIE HOLMES.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.327
THAT OLD BAG.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.229
SPEAKING OF AGE, AREN'T YOU
DATING THAT DETECTIVE?

00:28.262 --> 00:30.831
YEAH, NICE GIRLS DON'T MAKE EYES
AT STRANGE MEN ON THE SUBWAY.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.266
SO YOU ADMIT
I'M A NICE GIRL.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.102
NO, BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
WHAT NICE GIRLS DO,

00:34.135 --> 00:35.636
SO YOU CAN TRY TO BE
MORE LIKE THEM.
OKAY.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.605
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
IF ALL THE GUYS IN HERE

00:37.638 --> 00:39.607
WERE EYE-BANGING YOU?

00:39.640 --> 00:41.542
I'D LOVE IT.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.644
(Mindy)
JOURNALISM'S SO IMPORTANT.

00:43.677 --> 00:44.578
(Danny)
THAT'S NOT JOURNALISM.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.215
OH, MY GOD, GUYS,
LOOK AT THIS "WAS IT YOU?"

00:47.248 --> 00:48.849
"I WAS THE TALL,
BROWN-HAIRED GUY

00:48.882 --> 00:51.352
READING SALINGER
ON THE DOWNTOWN 1."

00:51.385 --> 00:52.453
THAT'S OUR TRAIN.
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.322
"AND YOU WERE
THE PRETTY INDIAN GIRL

00:54.355 --> 00:56.157
WITH THE VOICE
OF A CARTOON MOUSE..."

00:56.190 --> 00:57.525
ME, OBVIOUSLY.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.527
"SITTING NEXT
TO A FROWNING GUY

00:59.560 --> 01:01.562

ABOUT STREET PERFORMERS."

01:01.595 --> 01:03.297
WOW. WE'RE IN THIS.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.299
"I SMILED AT YOU.
YOU SMILED BACK.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.201
MY NAME IS ANDY,"
AND THEN HE PUT HIS EMAIL.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.869
DON'T CLICK ON THAT.
YOU'LL GET A VIRUS.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.304
DANNY, THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.772
THIS IS WHY I MOVED
TO NEW YORK CITY.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.774
LAST WEEK WE WERE JUST
STRANGERS ON THE SUBWAY,

01:13.807 --> 01:15.776
AND HE WAS READING
HIS SALINGER, AND NOW LOOK.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.044
I HAD A THING
WITH SALINGER.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.414
HE BASED THE PROSTITUTE
IN CATCHER IN THE RY ON ME.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.749
MEETING A GUY
FROM A NEWSPAPER AD--

01:21.782 --> 01:23.251
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
IN THE POST.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.386

01:25.419 --> 01:26.387
THAT'S AWESOME.
MM.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.388
I'M GONNA EMAIL HIM
RIGHT NOW.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.156
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE NOT.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.458
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
EMAIL THIS GUY.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.893
OKAY, PROMISE ME YOU'RE NOT
GONNA DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.596

06:23.884 --> 06:25.085
AND SHE JUST
WOULDN'T HAVE IT.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.920
SO WHAT I DID
IS I CREATED THIS GUY

06:26.954 --> 06:28.055
THAT SHE WOULD LIKE,

06:28.088 --> 06:29.690
SO MAYBE SHE WOULD
FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM

06:29.723 --> 06:31.559

STILL IN LOVE WITH ME.

YOU CAN'T TELL HER.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.694

TAMRA A RING?
A RING?

06:39.132 --> 06:40.434
TONE.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.436
A RINGTONE.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.672
IT WAS MONSTER MASH.
IT WAS OUR SONG.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.807
IT'S MY SONG.
SHE HATES IT.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.776
MORGAN, IF YOU PROMISE
NOT TO TELL MINDY,

06:48.809 --> 06:51.979
I THINK I CAN HELP YOU OUT
WITH THIS.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.847
[sighs]
LOOK, WHEN I TOLD YOU
NOT TO DATE MORGAN,

06:53.881 --> 06:56.116
I WAS PROJECTING
ON YOU, TAMRA,

06:56.149 --> 06:58.752
BECAUSE OF MY FEELINGS
FOR DR. LAHIRI.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.555
IT'S OKAY, DR. C.
WE'VE BEEN HOOKING UP ANYWAY.

07:01.589 --> 07:02.690
OH!

07:02.723 --> 07:04.091
THEN WHY'D YOU MAKE ME
APOLOGIZE?

07:04.124 --> 07:05.225
EH, IT WAS FUN.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.226
IT'S FUN.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.928
SO YOU AND DR. L, HUH?
YEAH.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.463
I GUESS IT WORKS.

07:09.497 --> 07:10.698
Y'ALL ARE BOTH OLD
LIKE KATIE HOLMES.
MM-HMM.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.633
SO WHERE ARE YOU GONNA TAKE HER
WHEN YOU FINALLY MEET HER?

07:12.666 --> 07:13.667
IT'S PERFECT--
I'M TAKING HER

07:13.701 --> 07:15.202
TO ONE OF THOSE GASTROPUB PLACES
SHE LIKES SO MUCH.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.904
THAT'S WHERE LOSERS
LIKE US GO.

07:16.937 --> 07:17.971
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:18.005 --> 07:20.207
YOU GOT TO MAKE MEETING
DR. L THE PERFECT MOMENT.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.009
SHE'S ALWAYS TALKING
ABOUT THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.777
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.746
WHAT IDEA?
I WAS COMPLAINING.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.715
OKAY,
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

07:27.748 --> 07:29.750
ACTUALLY,
WHO ARE YOU WEARING?

07:29.783 --> 07:30.818
I'M WEARING THIS.
UH-UH.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.920
YOU NEED TO DRESS LIKE
ONE OF THOSE GUYS SHE LIKES,

07:32.953 --> 07:33.987
LIKE BRADLEY COOPER.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.723
WHO'S BRADLEY COOPER?

07:35.756 --> 07:38.792
SO, CHARLIE, I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.060
I REALLY LIKE
DATING YOU.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.629
BUT YOU HAVE FEELINGS
FOR ANOTHER GUY,

07:41.662 --> 07:42.930
SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW
VERY WELL,

07:42.963 --> 07:43.997
BUT YOU WANT TO EXPLORE,

07:44.031 --> 07:45.866
AND YOU THINK TELLING ME
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.100
OH, MY GOD.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.936
YOU'RE, LIKE,
AN AMAZING DETECTIVE.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.904
I READ YOUR PHONE
WHEN YOU WERE IN THE BATHROOM.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.940
AND YOU GOT TO GO EASY
ON THE SELFIES, BY THE WAY.

07:52.973 --> 07:53.907
OH, MY GOD.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.843
LOOK, I-I'VE BEEN AROUND
LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW

07:55.876 --> 07:56.944
WHEN NOT TO GET
IN THE WAY.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.812
IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING,
SET IT FREE.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.814
RELAX.
I DON'T LOVE YOU.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.916
I LIKE YOU,
BUT YOU SNORE,

08:02.950 --> 08:05.653
AND I'M PRETTY SURE YOU TOOK
$20 OFF MY NIGHTSTAND.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.154
I BELIEVE I EARNED
THAT MONEY BACK

08:07.187 --> 08:08.822
WITH THE STUFF I DID TO YOU
LATER THAT NIGHT.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.891
YOU'RE DESCRIBING YOURSELF
AS A PROSTITUTE AGAIN.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.826
YOU GOT TO STOP THAT.
I KNOW, I KNOW.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.795
THE POINT IS I'M NOT GONNA
GET IN THE WAY.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.129
AND A WORD OF ADVICE--

08:16.163 --> 08:17.998
DON'T LET THAT GUY FROM WORK
GET IN THE WAY EITHER.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.833
MORGAN--HE'S A HUGE TIME-SUCK.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:19.867 --> 08:20.801
NO, NOT HIM.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.236
THE RICH KID FROM STATEN ISLAND,
LITTLE ONE.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.638
YEAH, DANNY.

08:24.672 --> 08:25.806
RIGHT.
THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.241
THANK YOU
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.242
MY ADVICE TO YOU--

08:29.276 --> 08:32.179
NAH, I'M GOOD.

08:35.916 --> 08:36.884
YOU'RE KILLING ME,
BRADLEY COOPER.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.986
WHAT IS THIS,
A 20-PIECE SUIT?

08:39.019 --> 08:42.556
[cell phone rings]

08:42.590 --> 08:44.992
OH, HELLO. WHO'S READY FOR THEIR
HOT DATE TONIGHT WITH ANDY?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.960
HEY, UM,
I NEED YOUR HELP.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.729
I ACTUALLY WAS TRYING
TO SPIT OUT SOME GUM,

08:48.762 --> 08:49.930
AND I SPAT IT
RIGHT IN MY HAIR.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.198
I NEED YOU TO CUT IT OUT
FOR ME.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.266
UH, NO, I CAN'T DO THAT
RIGHT NOW.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.735
I'M REALLY BUSY.

08:54.768 --> 08:55.903
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE BUSY?
DOING WHAT?

08:55.936 --> 08:57.070
I'M BUSY.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.772
I'M VERY, VERY, VERY BUSY
RIGHT NOW.

08:58.806 --> 08:59.973
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU'RE NEVER BUSY.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.775
I'M BUZZING UP.
YOU'RE WHAT?

09:01.809 --> 09:03.010
I'M ACTUALLY DOWNSTAIRS.
I'M GONNA COME UP.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.212
I'M BEING INTIMATE
WITH MYSELF.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.814
YOU'RE MASTURBATING?

09:06.847 --> 09:08.582
JULIANNA MARGULIES
IS ON TV RIGHT NOW.

09:08.616 --> 09:09.783
I'M WATCHING THE GOOD WIFE.

09:09.817 --> 09:10.918
YOU'RE HELPING ME.
I'M COMING UP.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.052
DON'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW, MINDY.
DON'T--

09:12.085 --> 09:13.086
BYE.
OKAY, BYE.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.122
[buzzer]

09:17.758 --> 09:21.194
[buzzer]

09:21.228 --> 09:23.797
SCREW YOU,
BRADLEY COOPER.

09:23.831 --> 09:24.798
AHH.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.166
NO.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.668
OKAY.
KEEP STILL.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.169
OW.
THAT DIDN'T HURT.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.804
OW.
OKAY, HERE YOU GO.

09:30.838 --> 09:31.939
WOW.
STOP CHEWING GUM.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.006
YOU'RE NOT TEN YEARS OLD.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.675
OR CARRY SCISSORS AROUND
WITH YOU.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.309
THANK YOU, DANNY.
OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.845
TIME TO GO.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.613
IT'S A QUARTER OF,
AND, YOU KNOW,

09:39.647 --> 09:40.848
I'M GETTING REAL TIRED,

09:40.881 --> 09:42.783
AND I'M GETTING ANXIOUS TO DO
MY NIGHTTIME RITUALS, SO...

09:42.816 --> 09:44.652
WELL, THEN START
YOUR RITUALS, JEEZ.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.686
I'M NOT LEAVING.

09:45.719 --> 09:46.754
I CAN'T BE EARLY
TO SEE ANDY.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.822
HE'S GONNA THINK
I'M A LOSER.
WHAT?

09:48.856 --> 09:51.124
(Danny)
WELL, YOU BETTER
GET OUT THERE AND GO MEET HIM.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.126
YOU MOVE LIKE A GLACIER.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.795
FIRST OF ALL,
STOP CALLING ME A GLACIER.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.296
WE BOTH KNOW
I'M TINY.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.798
BESIDES,
GLACIERS DON'T MOVE.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.066
GLOBAL WARMING'S A HOAX.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.133
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.635
YOU KNOW WHAT, DANNY?

10:01.669 --> 10:04.071
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.172
RIGHT ABOUT WHAT?

10:05.205 --> 10:06.640
I'M RIGHT
ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS.

10:06.674 --> 10:07.841
ABOUT US.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.911
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT US
NOT BEING TOGETHER.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.379
I MEAN, AT FIRST
IT WAS TOUGH.

10:12.412 --> 10:13.513
IT WAS REALLY TOUGH.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.816
BUT I REMEMBERED SOMETHING
THAT YOU SAID.

10:15.849 --> 10:18.218
YOU SAID THAT GUYS
DON'T BREAK UP WITH GIRLS

10:18.251 --> 10:19.920
THEY SECRETLY
WANT TO BE WITH.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.824
AND THEN I KNEW FOR CERTAIN
THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.926
AND THEN IT WAS--
IT WAS FINE, THOUGH,

10:25.959 --> 10:26.994
BECAUSE I LEARNED IN TIME

10:27.027 --> 10:29.362
THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU WEREN'T
RIGHT FOR ME EITHER.

10:29.396 --> 10:33.100
WE ARE WHO WE ARE,
AND THAT WON'T CHANGE.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.069
HEY, YOU DROWNING?

10:36.103 --> 10:38.071
NO, I-I'M HERE.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.807
OKAY, I LEFT A HUGE MESS.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.441
I'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW.
THANK YOU.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.712
[door opens and closes]

10:47.981 --> 10:49.983
[sighs happily]

11:09.236 --> 11:12.305
[thunder rumbles]

11:16.109 --> 11:17.477
HEY, BETS, WHERE'S MINDY?
IT'S 10:00.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.946
OH, YOU DIDN'T HEAR?

11:18.979 --> 11:20.447
SHE GOT STOOD UP
AT THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING

11:20.480 --> 11:22.415
LAST NIGHT, AND SHE CAUGHT
A REALLY BAD COLD.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.416
WHAT?

11:23.450 --> 11:24.985
ANDY STOOD HER UP?

11:25.018 --> 11:26.720
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

11:26.754 --> 11:27.788
I JUST CHECKED
THE FORECAST FOR LAST NIGHT

11:27.821 --> 11:31.024
AND SAW THAT IT WAS FREEZING
WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.459
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THAT,
DR. CASTELLANO,

11:32.492 --> 11:36.363
TO BE STOOD UP IN FREEZING
AND A CHANCE OF RAIN?

11:36.396 --> 11:40.467
I KNOW, I MEAN, MAYBE
THIS GUY HAD A GOOD REASON, I--

11:40.500 --> 11:43.971
(Mindy)
DANNY, DON'T COME NEAR ME.
I'M SICK AND DISGUSTING.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.305
YOU KNOW,
WHEN A CASTELLANO GETS SICK,

11:45.338 --> 11:47.474
WHICH ALMOST
NEVER HAPPENS,

11:47.507 --> 11:50.043
THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES US
FEEL BETTER IS TWO THINGS--

11:50.077 --> 11:51.779
A BOWL
OF CHICKEN NOODLE ZUPPA

11:51.812 --> 11:53.446
AND, MY FRIEND,

11:53.480 --> 11:55.082
THE GUINNESS BOOK
OF WORLD RECORDS.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.349
WHOA.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.451
OH, FROM 1983.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.453
YEAH.
THERE'S AN INSCRIPTION.

12:00.487 --> 12:03.390
"DEAR DANIEL, CONGRATS
ON YOUR DANCE RECITAL"--

12:03.423 --> 12:05.759
OKAY,
LET'S READ THAT LATER.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.427
OKAY.
MINDY...

12:07.460 --> 12:10.463
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING...

12:11.398 --> 12:12.800
ABOUT ANDY.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.234
I KNOW.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.436
IT WAS SO STUPID
THAT I WENT.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.771
I JUST THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE COOL.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.039
I'M THE LAMEST LAME-O.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.173
NO, NO, NO,
YOU'RE NOT LAME.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.541
LOOK, LET ME JUST--
LET ME JUST FINISH--

12:21.574 --> 12:24.111
NO, LET ME FINISH.
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO HEAR
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.378
OKAY, BUT I SHOULD'VE JUST
STAYED AT YOUR PLACE LAST NIGHT

12:25.412 --> 12:26.413
AND HUNG OUT WITH YOU.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.081
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
SO MUCH MORE FUN.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.883
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN STAY NOW?

12:29.917 --> 12:31.284
PLEASE, DANNY!

12:31.318 --> 12:32.085
PLEASE!

12:32.119 --> 12:33.987
WE CAN DO ANY BORING THING
YOU WANT.

12:34.021 --> 12:35.322
WE CAN READ ENCYCLOPEDIAS.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.824
YOU CAN TALK
ABOUT WALTER CRONKITE.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.391
WE CAN WATCH C-SPAN.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.827
OKAY, I'LL STAY.

12:39.860 --> 12:40.928
YOU WILL?
BUT YOU'RE SICK.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.562
LET'S WATCH WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO WATCH.

12:42.595 --> 12:46.233
HOW ABOUT THIS?
WHEN HARRY MET SALLY.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.368
I'LL ORDER WHATEVER
GAVE HER AN ORGASM.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.338
YOU PARAPHRASED ONE OF THE MOST
FAMOUS LINES PRETTY WELL.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.206
THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE.
OH, THANKS.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.541
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.509
OKAY, YOU KNOW
WHO DIRECTED THIS, RIGHT?

12:56.543 --> 12:58.045
MEATHEAD.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.412
HMM, I ALWAYS THOUGHT

12:59.446 --> 13:00.547
THAT MEG RYAN
AND BILLY CRYSTAL

13:00.580 --> 13:01.815
DIRECTED THIS TOGETHER.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.216
THAT'S NOT
HOW MOVIES WORK.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.185
GOD, YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT FILM.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.287
IT'S REALLY COOL.
THANKS.

13:10.357 --> 13:13.193
(Danny)
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD
TO DO THE RIGHT THING,

13:13.226 --> 13:16.463
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU REALLY,
REALLY DON'T WANT TO.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.099
BUT MAYBE IT'S OKAY.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.902
ANYONE CAN SAY, "I'M SORRY,
MINDY, FOR CATFISHING YOU

13:21.935 --> 13:23.871
WITH THE MAN
OF YOUR DREAMS."

13:23.904 --> 13:25.906
IT TAKES A REAL MAN
TO MARCH AROUND MANHATTAN

13:25.939 --> 13:30.177
VISITING EVERY PLACE
MEG RYAN EVER LAUGH-CRIED.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.445
AND I GET TO SEE NEW YORK
THROUGH HER EYES.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.482
AND, MAN, WAS IT WHITE.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.550
BUT IT WASN'T SO BAD.
IT WAS KIND OF NICE.

13:37.584 --> 13:41.388
AND I GOT TO SHOW HER
A LITTLE BIT OF MY NEW YORK.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.891
AND I THINK SHE LIKED IT.

13:43.924 --> 13:47.427
UNTIL ONE DAY,
ANDY WAS A DISTANT MEMORY.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.597
DANNY, I CAN'T WAIT TO DIE.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.233
MY FUNERAL IS GOING
TO BE OFF THE CHAIN.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.902
THERE'S GONNA BE
A SIGNATURE COCKTAIL.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.403
MY ASHES WILL BE
AROUND THE RIM.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.071
ASHES? YOU'RE NOT
GETTING CREMATED.

13:58.105 --> 14:01.474
ST. PETER DOESN'T WANT A PILE
OF DUST IN THE PEARLY GATES,

14:01.508 --> 14:02.542
AND I'M GONNA HAVE
TO VOUCH FOR YOU.

14:02.575 --> 14:03.543
HMM.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.412
BUT I WILL.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.479
YOU WILL?

14:06.513 --> 14:07.647
YEAH.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.118
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA BE REAL
CONNECTED UP THERE, TRUST ME.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.485
DO YOU WANT TO GO
GET BREAKFAST

14:12.519 --> 14:14.121
AND BE LATE FOR WORK?

14:14.154 --> 14:16.056
YEAH.

14:18.425 --> 14:19.426
OH, MY GOD.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.361
IT'S HIM.
OH, NO.

14:21.394 --> 14:24.397
GOD, YOU SON OF A BITCH!
I WAITED FOR HOURS FOR YOU!

14:24.431 --> 14:25.933
I LOOKED LIKE
SUCH AN IDIOT!

14:25.966 --> 14:27.167
WHY YOU HIT ME?

14:27.200 --> 14:29.002
I LEFT MY COUNTRY
TO ESCAPE THIS.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.437
YOU WISH YOU WERE
A REFUGEE!

14:30.470 --> 14:31.905
MINDY, MINDY, MINDY, NO.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.073
THAT'S NOT ANDY, OKAY?

14:33.106 --> 14:34.307
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:34.341 --> 14:36.676
THEN WHO'S ANDY?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.111
ME.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.913
WHAT?

14:39.947 --> 14:41.414
COME ON, MINDY,
JUST LISTEN TO ME!

14:41.448 --> 14:43.683
YOU CREATED A FAKE PERSON
FOR ME TO FALL IN LOVE WITH?

14:43.716 --> 14:44.651
(Danny)
MINDY.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.419
I MEAN, DANNY, WHO DID
I MAIL MY UNDERWEAR TO?

14:46.453 --> 14:47.420
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!

14:47.454 --> 14:49.389
DAMN IT, MINDY,
JUST LISTEN TO ME.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.557
GO TO HELL!

14:53.026 --> 14:55.228
GET OUT, RAPIST!
I COULD'VE BEEN NAKED.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.064
I NEED TO EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.231
EXPLAIN WHAT--

14:58.265 --> 14:59.666
THAT I SLAPPED
SOME GRAD STUDENT FROM EUROPE?

14:59.699 --> 15:00.767
HE'S GONNA GO BACK
TO HIS COUNTRY AND SAY,

AND EVERYTHING WOULD BE OKAY.

15:11.511 --> 15:15.082

WITH CHARLIE.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.087
OKAY.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.254
AND THEN HE STOOD ME UP

15:21.288 --> 15:23.490
AT MY FAVORITE PLACE
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

15:23.523 --> 15:24.424
I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU

A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.691
PLEASE LET IT BE BEER.
I'VE HAD THE WORST DAY.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.160

16:35.395 --> 16:37.297
DANNY PRETENDING
TO BE ANOTHER MAN TO WOO YOU

16:37.330 --> 16:39.632

IF YOU COULD JUST SIGN
THIS WAIVER

16:41.301 --> 16:43.136
SAYING YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SUE THE PRACTICE,

16:43.170 --> 16:44.137
IT WOULD REALLY
HELP ME OUT.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.138
CONSTANTLY SIGNING WAIVERS.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.173
PERFECT.

OH, AND, UH, YEAH, HE LOVES YOU.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.244
HE DOES NOT LOVE ME.
HE LOVES TO RUIN MY LIFE.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.246
NO, COME ON, YOU HAVE
TO GO MEET HIM.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.581

17:12.332 --> 17:13.466
WHY DO YOU DO THIS?

17:13.500 --> 17:14.801
I WAS IN HERE
ROOTING AROUND DANNY'S DESK

17:14.834 --> 17:16.703
TRYING TO FIND
SOME STAMPS TO STEAL,

17:16.736 --> 17:18.705
WHEN I FOUND THIS.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.574

ONE TIME I CAME IN HERE, AND HE
WAS STARING AT THOSE THINGS.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.623
SO EITHER HE'S THINKING
ABOUT BECOMING A WOMAN,

17:36.656 --> 17:38.125
OR HE'S OBVIOUSLY
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.360
