00:06.090 --> 00:08.729
MAN: Good. You listen to this,

00:08.790 --> 00:10.872
I can come to your house. I can
come to your neighbors' house.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.388
WOMAN: You cannot!MAN: I could come to your
parents' house and say

00:13.440 --> 00:15.305
that you welched on your debt.WOMAN: Sir... You know
where my parents live?

00:15.360 --> 00:17.965
MAN: You took out money

WOMAN: I've paid every cent.MAN: Yes, you should... I can
do that, it is not illegal

00:20.450 --> 00:23.180

00:23.240 --> 00:25.458

00:25.500 --> 00:28.014
MAGGIE: No, I do understand.
I don't think that you...

00:28.070 --> 00:30.459
MAN: I have your Social Security
number, Maggie.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.843

I can ruin your life.

00:32.900 --> 00:36.461
MAGGIE:

MAN: I-I deal with liars
all day.MAGGIE: What?

00:40.600 --> 00:42.329
MAN: And I thought
you weren't one of them.

00:42.390 --> 00:46.292
MAGGIE:
I have paid you $8,900...

00:46.350 --> 00:47.863
MAN: _
You have not, Maggie, and I'm
gonna come to your house and I'm

00:47.910 --> 00:49.605
gonna knock on your door.
And then I'm gonna knock

00:49.650 --> 00:51.606
on your neighbor's door.MAGGIE: That... no...

00:51.660 --> 00:54.390
MAGGIE: You can't do that.MAN: And I'm gonna say you
welched.

00:54.440 --> 00:57.261
Maggie, you took out a student
loan and you didn't repay.

00:57.310 --> 00:59.619
I can do anything I damn please!

00:59.660 --> 01:01.309
MAGGIE: I already paid you, sir!MAN: I can garnish your wages.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.442
I can call you at work!MAGGIE: I have paid you.

call extension 853,
you got that?

01:10.800 --> 01:12.358
MAGGIE: Look, I paid!

01:12.420 --> 01:13.978

01:15.510 --> 01:17.284
MAN: ...by stepping in front

01:17.330 --> 01:20.549
Just pay your debts!MAGGIE: What?!

01:20.600 --> 01:23.558
That was yesterday.
That's why I called Lucca.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.158
She wants to stop
the harassment.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.381
May I?Yeah. Um, Maggie,

01:26.430 --> 01:28.603
this is Jason Crouse,
our investigator.

01:28.650 --> 01:30.515
Nice to meet you.So-- you know

01:30.560 --> 01:31.549
how much
we charge, Maggie?

01:31.610 --> 01:34.340
Uh, yeah,
Lucca said $150 an hour.

01:34.390 --> 01:35.379
It's worth it
If you can

01:35.440 --> 01:37.396
make him
stop calling.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.953
And this is A.P.Y. Collections?

01:39.010 --> 01:40.432
Yes. Uh, Bob Bondi.

01:40.490 --> 01:42.003
But I already
complained to his manager

01:42.050 --> 01:44.314
and he won't do anything.Well, we can
bring suit.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.533
Often that's enough
to scare them off.

01:46.580 --> 01:50.186
But sometimes these places
can be a bit intransigent.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.367
And we would
have to prepare for court.

01:52.410 --> 01:54.583
I don't have a lot of money.
I mean,

01:54.630 --> 01:56.188
I'm still working temp jobs.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.549
I should have gone to law
school, like you. [chuckles]

01:58.590 --> 02:01.024
Instead, I went to Colosseum--

02:01.070 --> 02:03.504
worst educational
experience ever.

02:03.550 --> 02:05.415
But I can pay you
a bit every month.

02:05.470 --> 02:06.505
Bob Bondi, please.

02:08.470 --> 02:09.858
Oh, you won't get him at work.

02:09.910 --> 02:11.639
I'm not calling him at work.

02:11.690 --> 02:13.123
Hi, is this
Mrs. Bondi?

02:13.170 --> 02:14.649
Hi. I work with
your husband, do...

02:14.690 --> 02:16.646
do you mind getting him for me?

02:16.700 --> 02:19.123
Thank you.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.081
Bob. Hey, how you doing?
This is Jason.

02:22.140 --> 02:24.176
No, 1-1 know
you don't know me.

02:24.230 --> 02:26.312
Hold on.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.521
[speaker beeps]Strangely enough, Bob,

02:28.580 --> 02:30.093
I know you.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.754
Wait, wait, who...You live at

02:31.800 --> 02:35.440
1245 Rosalia Avenue, you have...

02:35.500 --> 02:36.842
Who is this?
How do you know that?

02:36.890 --> 02:38.061
This is Jason Crouse, Bob.

02:38.110 --> 02:39.623
I want you to focus.
I know

02:39.680 --> 02:41.489
your Social Security number,
I know your address,

02:41.550 --> 02:43.768
I know your neighbors' names.

02:43.810 --> 02:45.368
How did you get this number?

02:45.420 --> 02:46.728
Here's what I need
you to do.

02:46.770 --> 02:48.590
I need you
go into work today...

02:48.640 --> 02:49.948
I'm calling the police-- I
don't... I'm calling the police.

02:49.990 --> 02:51.685
Okay. Go ahead.

02:51.730 --> 02:53.516
We'll talk about
your priors in California.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.516
My priors?
What are you talking about?

02:55.560 --> 02:56.731
Background, Bob. I am talking
about your background.

02:56.780 --> 02:58.338
I'm sure your boss

02:58.390 --> 02:59.561
would be
interested to know.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.339
Neighbors
might be, too.

03:03.700 --> 03:04.826
Bob?

03:04.880 --> 03:06.950
What do you want?
[sighs]

03:07.010 --> 03:09.649
I want you
to lay off of Maggie...

03:09.710 --> 03:11.792
Uh, Rossum.Rossum. She paid her debt.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.479
I am looking
at a cancelled check here

03:14.540 --> 03:16.189
that you guys cashed.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.186
The account is settled, Bob.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.969
Look, look, I'll try to get this
straightened out, but it's

03:20.020 --> 03:21.624
not just up to me,
you got to know that.

03:21.670 --> 03:22.978
Who's it up to, Bob?

03:23.020 --> 03:24.840
My manager, Nelson Olstead.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.709
I only do what he says.

03:26.770 --> 03:29.671
Okay. I'm gonna contact him.

03:29.730 --> 03:32.506
Don't call Maggie again, Bob.

03:34.030 --> 03:35.588
I know your number.

03:35.650 --> 03:36.685
[hangs up]

03:38.040 --> 03:39.689
Wow.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.509
I don't think it's over yet.
I think they're gonna

03:45.570 --> 03:47.435
just put someone else
on her account.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.822
So we show 'em
her cancelled check.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.302
No.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.443
My guess is A.P.Y.
is charging her twice.

03:53.490 --> 03:54.707
That, or they're
playing some sort of

03:54.750 --> 03:55.796
a shell game
with her money.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.228
You can find out?

03:57.280 --> 03:59.054
How many hours can I charge?

03:59.100 --> 04:00.658
Four.

04:00.710 --> 04:03.759
Okay. I will call you
if it requires more.

04:07.940 --> 04:11.979
So, our first case, good.

04:12.030 --> 04:13.588
$150 an hour?

04:13.640 --> 04:15.414
I had to say something.

04:15.470 --> 04:17.153
What is our price?

04:17.210 --> 04:19.246
$200 an hour.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.597
On the next one.

04:20.650 --> 04:22.515
GRACE:
I'd go higher than $200.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.948
We need some working cash, mom.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.436
I know. I'm doing my best.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.528
PETER: ...a responsible
governor.What's that?

04:29.570 --> 04:31.606
Dad. I Iowa.PETER: I like Iowa. I'm here
because it's the state

04:31.660 --> 04:33.173
neighboring my own.REPORTER: And you're saying

04:33.220 --> 04:34.915
this has nothing to
do with running for president?

04:34.970 --> 04:37.268
No, what I'm saying is that
at the moment I'm not running.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.265
But I do want_to talk
about pen5|ons.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.185
As a responsible governor,

04:41.230 --> 04:43.186
I think we have to start
the conversation

04:43.230 --> 04:46.188
about setting limits
and rolling back pensions.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.060
REPORTER: Really? You're
sounding more like Marco Rubio.

04:48.110 --> 04:49.668
[laughs]

04:49.720 --> 04:52.769
I think we should stop
sounding like a Democrat

04:52.810 --> 04:54.937
or a Republican and start
sounding like Americans.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.287
I think that's
what Americans want.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.638
I think that's what we need now.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.204
The partisanship that's going on

04:59.250 --> 05:01.764
in this election is killing us.

05:03.990 --> 05:06.686
So did you have trouble
getting your desk in here, Dad?

05:06.740 --> 05:08.776
Mm-hmm. Marissa,
brightening up my day.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.697
This has not been focus-grouped.
This is simply what I believe.

05:11.740 --> 05:14.300
REPORTER:
But aren't you just playing
back-of-the-pack politics,

05:14.350 --> 05:16.784
Governor? Saying something
controversial and wild

05:16.830 --> 05:18.138
to get press coverage?Oh, my God.

05:18.180 --> 05:19.704
What a disaster.Well, I would not characterize

05:19.750 --> 05:21.183
this as talking wild.

05:21.230 --> 05:23.835
This is responsible
fiscal accountability.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.758
Look, the fact of the matter is
is that unions have

05:26.800 --> 05:29.667
far too much control in this
country. They are strangling...

05:29.720 --> 05:31.620
Hey.Dad, I love you,

05:31.670 --> 05:33.888
but this is an
intervention.Give me the remote.

05:33.940 --> 05:36.158
Peter chose Ruth over you.
You have to let it go.What are you

05:36.200 --> 05:37.758
talking about?
This is my job.No, this

05:37.810 --> 05:39.323
wasyour job.
They fired you.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.677
What are you getting
out of this?

05:40.730 --> 05:41.765
I mean, besides this
luxurious office?

05:41.810 --> 05:43.766
I'm looking after Alicia.This isn't

05:43.820 --> 05:45.685
about Alicia.
You're getting back at Peter.What are you

05:45.730 --> 05:47.459
talking about?
That makes no sense.I know.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.646
And that's why
you need to leave.

05:48.690 --> 05:49.770
You watched
his InterVIew,

05:49.820 --> 05:50.900
scoffing the whole
way through,

05:50.950 --> 05:52.508
but I don't see you

05:52.560 --> 05:53.606
going in there
to tell him what he did wrong.

05:53.650 --> 05:55.129
He's not here. He's in Iowa.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.386
Then call him.

05:58.830 --> 06:01.298
Then let's go.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.227
Dad, you'll get a new job.
You're desirable.

06:05.530 --> 06:07.225
I've never been fired
in my life.

06:07.270 --> 06:08.828
I know.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.619
And it hurts.
I've been fired eight times.

06:10.670 --> 06:11.750
It doesn't get easier.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.791
Come on.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.844
Give me the remote.

06:17.890 --> 06:19.892
Ruth Eastman
devised the strategy

06:19.940 --> 06:22.454
for that interview, and it makes
Peter look like an idiot.

06:22.510 --> 06:24.853
The press is gonna
have a field day. I can't leave

06:27.250 --> 06:30.333
and realize Ruth is foisting
a losing strategy on him.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.642
I love you.
This is not healthy.

06:32.690 --> 06:34.339
The remote, babe.

06:34.390 --> 06:38.258
[sighs]

06:38.310 --> 06:39.914
MAN: _
Glad you came In.
Please, please, sit.

06:39.960 --> 06:40.858
Thank you,
Mr. Erickson.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.080
Ronnie's fine.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.438
Ronnie. Uh...

06:44.490 --> 06:46.913
Well, I know you'll be mostly
interfacing with Howard,

06:46.970 --> 06:49.268
but as one of the three
partners at Lockhart/Agos,

06:49.320 --> 06:50.708
I just wanted to
personally welcome you.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.536
Well, thank you.And...

06:52.580 --> 06:54.093
I understand you've been
with the Food Service Union

06:54.150 --> 06:56.277
for 33 years.Food and CommercialServices.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.709
[phone rings]I... Oh, excuse me.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.456
Oh, I do have to take this.
Uh...

07:01.500 --> 07:03.548
No, please.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.652
[sighs]

07:39.410 --> 07:41.366
Did you tell Ronnie Erickson
I went to prison?

07:41.410 --> 07:43.230
Do you ever knock?He's acting
like I'm a crook.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.009
Did you tell him?!If the guy doesn't

07:45.070 --> 07:47.504
take a shine to you,
that's your problem.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.154
You crossed a line, Howard.You can't come
barging in here

07:49.200 --> 07:51.282
and accuse me of, what,
truth-telling?So you admit it.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.808
_ Since when is truth-
telllng a crIme?You... you want to talk,

07:53.860 --> 07:55.816
how about you, now?I'll tell you what
the problem is.

07:55.860 --> 07:57.851
You do zero, Howard.I'm the guy that brings in...

07:57.910 --> 07:59.298
You sit around with your pants
down, literally![both yelling]

07:59.340 --> 08:00.602
Nelson Olstead.
I'm the manager

08:00.650 --> 08:02.345
of A.P.Y. Collections.
Hello.

08:02.390 --> 08:04.164
Hey, thank you for meeting me.
I'm with Avon-Isolade,

08:04.220 --> 08:06.176
a debt brokerage
out of Gary, Indiana.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.120
You want to buy my bad debt?Come on, there's
no such thing

08:08.180 --> 08:10.307
as bad debt.
Just bad collectors.

08:10.350 --> 08:12.352
Let me ask you something,
broker to broker.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.049
You ever double dip
any of these?

08:14.100 --> 08:15.488
No.
There's enough real debt.

08:15.530 --> 08:16.872
We don't
have to make it up.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.659
I mean, debt collecting
might not be glamorous,

08:18.710 --> 08:20.268
but it's legit.
At least the way I do it.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.276
What about your other offices?
What about Michigan?

08:22.320 --> 08:23.969
We don't have a Michigan office.

08:25.760 --> 08:30.231
Then why do I have this canceled
check out of Muskegon, Michigan?

08:30.290 --> 08:32.713
I have no idea, but we don't
have any offices there.

08:34.730 --> 08:37.722
[sighs]
Thank you.

08:37.770 --> 08:41.035
The address you sent
your checks to--

08:41.080 --> 08:42.468
did it change recently?

08:42.520 --> 08:44.681
What do you mean?

08:44.740 --> 08:46.822
This check-- the-the
most recent one.

08:46.870 --> 08:49.088
How'd you know to send it
to Michigan address?

08:49.130 --> 08:50.654
What's going on?Your last check

08:50.700 --> 08:52.304
was cashed at
a Michigan bank.

08:52.350 --> 08:54.398
There are no
A.P.Y. offices there.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.351
It was from a voice mail.

08:58.010 --> 08:59.659
You still have it?

08:59.710 --> 09:03.055
MAN:
This is a courtesy message
from A.P.Y. Collections.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.091
We're calling to let you know
that the address

09:05.150 --> 09:07.664
for remittance of your scheduled
loan payments has changed.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.278
It's not Bondi.

09:09.330 --> 09:10.672
Please send remittances

09:10.720 --> 09:13.678
to 390 Deerhorn Park.
Suite 777.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.632
Thank you.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.500
Wait, that wasn't A.P.Y.?

09:18.550 --> 09:19.949
That was a scam artist.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.946
He either hacked
into the A.P.Y. network

09:21.990 --> 09:23.594
or he bought
your records.

09:23.650 --> 09:26.335
Collection agencies
are wide open to abuse.

09:26.390 --> 09:27.732
So her last payment was

09:27.780 --> 09:29.384
to the wrong person?Yes.

09:29.430 --> 09:31.341
Oh, my God,
so I really do owe

09:31.390 --> 09:33.608
$8,000 to A.P.Y.
then, don't I?

09:33.660 --> 09:35.218
JASON:
Yeah, legally.

09:35.270 --> 09:36.214
MAGGIE:
I... There's got to be

09:36.270 --> 09:37.305
something I can do.

09:37.350 --> 09:40.433
I-I can't pay it again.

09:40.490 --> 09:42.219
Can I make an
argument here, Mom?

09:42.270 --> 09:44.579
Yeah, sure. What's up?

09:44.620 --> 09:46.702
Okay, the settlement you won
for the Chagall painting--

09:46.760 --> 09:49.570
your payout was
$4,000 for 20 hours of work

09:49.630 --> 09:50.972
Right.

09:51.020 --> 09:53.750
As opposed to $500,000

09:53.810 --> 09:55.584
if it had been on contingency.

09:55.630 --> 09:58.326
Yes, but the rules
on contingency

09:58.380 --> 10:00.325
for probate are very strict.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.200
It would've been almost the same
as our hourly rate.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.764
Oh. Okay, well,
I didn't know that.

10:04.820 --> 10:06.424
But on these other
cases, can't we start

10:06.470 --> 10:07.812
taking them on
contingency?

10:07.860 --> 10:09.816
Sure, but the cases
that come through the door

10:09.870 --> 10:12.907
are too small.
We want the money up front.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.030
Maybe we shouldn't be taking
such small cases.

10:15.090 --> 10:17.650
Look, I want bigger cases
too, Grace,

10:17.700 --> 10:20.260
but we need to win_the small
ones to get the big ones.

10:20.310 --> 10:22.392
Is there any way
to turn the smaller ones

10:22.440 --> 10:23.486
into the bigger ones?

10:23.530 --> 10:25.657
Well, um, I don't know how,

10:25.710 --> 10:28.224
but that sounds good.

10:28.270 --> 10:30.272
I'm just worried about our bills

10:30.320 --> 10:31.753
I know. I am too, honey.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.791
But this is what
starting out looks like.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.847
What?

10:43.810 --> 10:46.984
Could you get me everything you
can on Colosseum University?

10:47.030 --> 10:49.419
Sure. What's that?

10:49.470 --> 10:51.859
It's a for-profit school.

10:51.910 --> 10:54.162
It's about to be sold.

10:54.210 --> 10:56.826
Does that mean money?

10:56.870 --> 10:59.737
It might.

10:59.780 --> 11:02.601
Well, I'll get right on it.

11:02.660 --> 11:04.048
...you admitted earlier.Uh, okay.

11:04.090 --> 11:06.092
[both arguing at once]Come on. Sit down.

11:06.140 --> 11:07.698
...guilty of telling the truth.Am I the only one
who's upset by this?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.786
Is Howard Lyman really
what this firm is about now?

11:09.840 --> 11:11.614
You better watch it,
buddy boy. I am this close

11:11.670 --> 11:13.319
to filing suit.In order to sue somebody,

11:13.360 --> 11:14.884
you'd have to know how.There he goes again,

11:14.930 --> 11:16.534
undercutting me
with ageist comments.

11:16.580 --> 11:17.660
Oh, all right. All right.What?!

11:17.720 --> 11:19.529
Cary, can I have a word?I am aggrieved,

11:19.590 --> 11:21.751
I tell you. I am aggrieved.

11:21.810 --> 11:25.507
You have to stop with
the ageist comments, Cary.

11:25.550 --> 11:26.710
What?!

11:26.770 --> 11:28.852
Are you seriously siding
with him?

11:28.900 --> 11:30.720
Cary, you are not a member
of a protected class.

11:30.770 --> 11:32.897
Howard is.HOWARD:
I want

11:32.950 --> 11:35.418
in-house mediation.Howard, please.

11:35.470 --> 11:36.869
I've consulted an attorney.

11:36.910 --> 11:37.774
Who, Alicia?

11:37.820 --> 11:39.344
I know my rights

11:39.390 --> 11:40.903
pursuant
to my partnership agreement.

11:40.960 --> 11:44.737
And if you refuse,
my only recourse is to sue.

11:44.790 --> 11:47.350
LUCCA:
We're gonna keep trying

11:47.400 --> 11:49.618
to get your money back.But it doesn't
look good.

11:49.660 --> 11:51.708
But there might be a way to
cancel out your debt entirely.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.308
We've done some research
on your univerSIty.

11:53.360 --> 11:56.796
They've been subject
to dozens of complaints

11:56.840 --> 11:58.091
to the attorney general's
office.

11:58.150 --> 11:59.538
They're a for-profit school.

11:59.580 --> 12:01.445
They treat education
like a product.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.196
And based on what you've told
us, it's a defective product.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.800
You borrowed $46,000
for an education

12:06.850 --> 12:08.408
that didn't yield a job.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.633
You want me to sue Colosseum?We want you

12:10.680 --> 12:13.023
to let ussue Colosseum.They're about

12:13.080 --> 12:14.763
to be acquired by a private
equity firm out of Texas.

12:14.820 --> 12:16.378
A lawsuit would have
to be disclosed

12:16.430 --> 12:17.772
to the potential buyer,

12:17.820 --> 12:19.299
and that could tank
the deal.

12:19.340 --> 12:21.558
Look, I can't afford
a big lawsuit.We know.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.771
That's why we're going
to take this on contingency.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.604
You don't pay anything.

12:25.650 --> 12:28.608
Our payment comes
from the settlement.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.958
What do you say, Mags?

12:31.010 --> 12:33.353
MAN:
That's a nifty theory

12:33.400 --> 12:36.221
there, counselors.LUCCA:
It's not a theory.

12:36.270 --> 12:37.658
It's a fact.

12:37.710 --> 12:39.962
Our client bought an
education from you,

12:40.020 --> 12:41.920
and it hasn't done
what you said it would.

12:41.970 --> 12:45.098
Where did you go to school,
Mrs. Florrick?

12:45.150 --> 12:46.879
Georgetown.Hmm.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.805
Did they teach you
to read there?

12:48.850 --> 12:51.193
Excuse me?

12:52.980 --> 12:55.198
Our enrollment agreement.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.639
Your client signed one.

12:57.680 --> 13:00.808
And paragraph 23
is the...

13:00.860 --> 13:03.909
An arbitration clause.Oh, you canread.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.680
It clearly states that
any grievances must be settled

13:06.740 --> 13:11.302
in arbitration and settled
within 18 months of graduation.

13:11.350 --> 13:15.787
Your client graduated
17 months ago,

13:15.830 --> 13:17.695
so you do the math.

13:24.100 --> 13:28.537
PETER:
Where is she?! Ruth!

13:33.200 --> 13:35.634
Did you see this?

13:40.290 --> 13:43.817
[indistinct arguing]

13:51.700 --> 13:53.736
[Peter yelling indistinctly]

13:57.660 --> 13:59.048
PETER: ...well, then, who
the hell is my constituency!

13:59.090 --> 14:01.786
I mean, look at this!
And this one!

14:01.840 --> 14:03.705
It's a nightmare, Ruth!RUTH: It's not, Governor.

14:03.750 --> 14:06.537
PETER: Foot in mouth disease!
That's what they're saying!

14:06.580 --> 14:08.138
RUTH: This is all part
of a strategy.

14:08.190 --> 14:10.533
PETER: Ruth, don't be
ridiculous. This is a screw-up.

14:10.580 --> 14:12.059
RUTH: Calm down, sir.

14:12.110 --> 14:14.499
[speaking indistinctly]
...everything is under control.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.586
PETER:
Don't be ridiculous.

14:15.630 --> 14:17.359
[Peter continues,
indistinctly]

14:25.160 --> 14:27.208
Is everything all right?

14:27.250 --> 14:29.810
I was gonna show you this later,
Mr. Governor.

14:29.860 --> 14:31.122
After I got more
information.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.819
I saw_the interview
In Iowa.

14:32.870 --> 14:35.646
Would you like to discuss it?

14:39.960 --> 14:41.609
Is this real?

14:41.660 --> 14:43.173
As r_ea| _
as anything, Sll‘.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.528
It's from
our Internals.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.525
Look, if there's any way
I can help...

14:47.580 --> 14:49.093
You're in second place.

14:49.140 --> 14:51.449
And climbing.Wow!

14:51.490 --> 14:53.538
[laughs]

14:53.580 --> 14:54.922
You're not selling yourself
to the press, Mr. Governor.

14:54.980 --> 14:56.538
They won't embrace
you, anyway.

14:56.590 --> 14:58.069
We're going right
to the people.

14:58.110 --> 15:00.101
Yes, you're saying
controversial things.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.025
Yes, it's the same strategy
as the Republicans.

15:02.070 --> 15:04.584
But it's working,
and you're winning.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.370
Ruth, I am so sorry
I flew off the handle.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.206
Terrific job!

15:09.250 --> 15:10.160
Each day's an adventure.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.030
Okay, now what's next?

15:12.080 --> 15:14.901
What we're gonna do is keep
pushing this anti-union message.

15:14.950 --> 15:16.736
Next, we go to Illinois
Management Coalitions...

15:51.250 --> 15:52.638
Good morning.

15:52.690 --> 15:55.329
Let me start by saying
that this is not a courtroom

15:55.380 --> 15:56.642
and I am not a judge.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.863
But in all ways,
the decision here is final.

15:58.910 --> 16:01.549
Arbitration_t_ake_s the
place of litigation.

16:01.610 --> 16:03.692
Mediation does not replace
Hﬁgaﬁon.

16:03.740 --> 16:06.345
It is an attempt
to settle differences amicably,

16:06.400 --> 16:08.300
which is in the best interests
of the firm

16:08.350 --> 16:10.045
and in your own
best interests,

16:10.090 --> 16:11.876
since you are partners
in this firm.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.319
MAN:
Let's go around the table

16:13.360 --> 16:15.180
first, and...

16:15.230 --> 16:18.484
please share your names and your
most embarrassing experience.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.792
That was
a joke, people.

16:20.840 --> 16:23.274
Uh, you have my permission
to lighten up.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.491
Why don't we start to my right.

16:25.540 --> 16:27.713
Lucca Quinn.
Representing Maggie Rossum.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.637
Alicia Florrick.
The same.

16:29.680 --> 16:30.806
Carter Schmidt.

16:30.850 --> 16:32.454
Representing
Colosseum University.

16:32.510 --> 16:34.592
Good. We got through that
without an argument.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.289
We're well
on our way.

16:36.340 --> 16:38.808
I'm Geoffrey Solomon.
I'll be your spirit guide.

16:38.860 --> 16:41.465
We will hear evidence and
follow the admissibility rules

16:41.520 --> 16:43.556
as determined
by Rule 90

16:43.610 --> 16:45.032
of the Illinois
Supreme Court.

16:45.090 --> 16:48.560
So, counselors,
call your first witness.

16:48.610 --> 16:49.952
Why does he get to go first?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.604
I'm doing it alphabetically.

16:51.660 --> 16:53.218
Eh. Convenient.

16:54.620 --> 16:56.178
Cary, what are
your grievances?

16:56.230 --> 16:58.653
How are you... aggrieved?

16:58.710 --> 17:00.223
He's embarrassing
in front of clients.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.225
That's code for "old."

17:02.280 --> 17:05.579
And he sticks his nose
where it doesn't belong.That's code

17:05.630 --> 17:07.052
for "Jewish."

17:07.110 --> 17:08.190
ALICIA:
You teach at Colosseum

17:08.240 --> 17:09.719
in the dental hygienist
program,

17:09.760 --> 17:11.318
Ms. Howe?Yes.

17:11.370 --> 17:13.190
And what subject did
you teach my client?

17:13.240 --> 17:14.639
Periodontics.

17:14.680 --> 17:15.635
Are you a
periodontist?

17:15.680 --> 17:16.931
No. I'm a dental
hygienist.

17:16.990 --> 17:18.639
A licensed
dental hygienist?

17:18.680 --> 17:22.116
Well, I was. I may have let
my certification lapse.

17:22.170 --> 17:23.421
VVhen?

17:23.470 --> 17:24.949
Uh, a couple years ago.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.070
LUCCA:
13 years ago, actually.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.291
And you were never licensed
in the state of Illinois.

17:29.350 --> 17:30.954
I know this isn't court,
but I don't think

17:31.000 --> 17:32.513
she can both ask and answer

17:32.570 --> 17:34.652
the questions.Counselor.

17:34.700 --> 17:39.046
How could my client have
received an adequate education

17:39.100 --> 17:40.965
if you're not
a licensed hygienist?

17:41.010 --> 17:42.261
Because I'm a good teacher.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.708
All my students think so.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.615
No further questions.

17:45.670 --> 17:47.444
Where were you licensed?

17:47.500 --> 17:48.626
Ohio.

17:48.670 --> 17:50.456
And dental anatomy
doesn't change

17:50.500 --> 17:52.229
when you cross state
lines, does it?

17:52.280 --> 17:54.066
I don't think so.

17:54.110 --> 17:55.543
Okay.

17:55.590 --> 17:57.239
Nothing further.Ms. Howe,

17:57.290 --> 18:00.066
uh, this is a final exam
you gave my client

18:00.120 --> 18:01.724
last year.

18:01.770 --> 18:06.776
Can you please read
the first question?

18:06.820 --> 18:10.608
"What does the phrenic
nerve innervate?"

18:10.650 --> 18:13.289
What's the answer
to that?

18:17.790 --> 18:19.041
Objection, Your Honor.

18:19.090 --> 18:21.263
Oh, no. I-I think
we could all benefit

18:21.310 --> 18:23.358
from that answer.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.789
The_exam was
multiple ch0ice,

18:25.840 --> 18:28.149
and you've put a piece of tape
over all the choices.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.624
Right. Uh, go ahead.
Remove the tape.

18:30.670 --> 18:32.626
We'll wait.

18:32.670 --> 18:35.628
What's the answer?

18:35.670 --> 18:37.626
"A."

18:37.680 --> 18:39.284
No. Actually,

18:39.330 --> 18:41.321
itls "D."

18:43.290 --> 18:45.758
HOWARD:
Geezer,

18:45.820 --> 18:49.244
gargoyle, old fart,

18:49.300 --> 18:52.076
Flaccido Domingo.

18:52.130 --> 18:53.472
That_ one h_urt
espeCIally, given

18:53.520 --> 18:54.771
my devotion to the opera.

18:54.820 --> 18:58.210
And, uh...
and my sexual prowess.

18:58.260 --> 19:01.138
And you would like
this name-calling to stop?

19:01.180 --> 19:02.693
Yes, I would.

19:02.750 --> 19:03.739
I've spent 30 years
in this business.

19:03.790 --> 19:05.485
I think I deserve
a little respect.

19:05.530 --> 19:07.395
Diane, do you have a minute?And where are you going?

19:07.450 --> 19:08.747
We just need a moment, Howard.Objection.

19:08.790 --> 19:10.746
You cannot have an
ex parte conversation

19:10.800 --> 19:12.756
in the middle of our trial.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.279
You're the one
who called Howard

19:14.320 --> 19:15.400
an old geezer.

19:15.450 --> 19:16.758
Okay.I'm not the only one

19:16.800 --> 19:18.756
guilty of a few indiscretions.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.415
Cary, please.
We're only going through this

19:20.460 --> 19:21.973
to keep Howard from suing.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.930
Are you sure you're
not hanging me out to dry?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.206
I want your ex parte

19:30.250 --> 19:33.378
communication noted
for the record.There is

19:33.430 --> 19:35.682
no record, Howard. We're
just trying to clear the air.

19:35.730 --> 19:38.779
_ And I think we have _
accomplished that, so...I want to call a Witness.

19:38.820 --> 19:40.822
You can't call a witness.
This isn't a hearing.I call

19:40.870 --> 19:43.213
Diane Lockhart to the stand.

19:43.260 --> 19:45.649
MARISSA:
Hello, Father.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.429
I want to run something by you,

19:47.490 --> 19:49.560
but I need
your undivided attention.

19:51.050 --> 19:52.699
I'm thinking of taking
pole dancing classes.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.001
What do you think?

19:54.060 --> 19:55.618
If it makes you happy, dear.

19:55.670 --> 19:57.058
Do you know Eyal Naftali?

19:57.100 --> 19:59.796
Is that a club?

19:59.850 --> 20:02.808
He's the chief
of staff to Israe_l'_s
communications minister.

20:02.850 --> 20:05.068
He wants to talk to you
about running his campaign.

20:05.110 --> 20:06.839
His campaign for what?

20:06.900 --> 20:08.800
The Knesset.

20:08.850 --> 20:10.806
And, in a few years,
prime minister.

20:10.860 --> 20:12.248
How do you know this?I knew

20:12.290 --> 20:13.552
his daughter in the IDF.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.897
Her dad contacted me.

20:14.950 --> 20:16.850
I see what you're doing.

20:16.910 --> 20:18.855
I'm giving you the chance
to make an impact, Dad.

20:18.910 --> 20:21.424
It's "have" an impact,
"make" a difference.You want

20:21.480 --> 20:23.254
Netanyahu out,
here's your chance.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.177
Mr. Naftali is offering
you twice as much

20:25.220 --> 20:26.778
as you're
making now.How do you know what I make?

20:26.830 --> 20:28.604
I'm a witch.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.218
Talk to him, Dad.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.521
What do you have to lose?

20:34.490 --> 20:38.665
82% of Colosseum graduates
find employment within a year

20:38.710 --> 20:41.178
of graduation.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.447
What employment?

20:45.240 --> 20:47.879
What do you mean?You said 82%

20:47.940 --> 20:50.898
find employment within
a year of graduating.

20:50.940 --> 20:53.283
I'm just asking: what
kind of employment

20:53.330 --> 20:54.854
are we talking
about here?

20:54.900 --> 20:56.856
Professional employment?
Fast food work?

20:56.900 --> 20:59.118
Temping, like Maggie?Any employment.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.115
How many work less than 15 hours
a week?

21:01.170 --> 21:04.549
MAN:
I have no idea.Well, we do. 33%.

21:04.610 --> 21:06.771
How many work
minimum wage jobs?We run a high-risk,

21:06.830 --> 21:08.957
low-functioning
population, miss.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.308
Fifty-five percent.

21:10.350 --> 21:11.954
Why don't you put that
in your brochure?

21:12.000 --> 21:13.956
Let's not
badger, shall we?

21:14.010 --> 21:17.912
The reality is the vast majority
of Colosseum students end up

21:17.970 --> 21:19.835
worse off than
before they started.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.531
They wind up unemployable
and saddled with massive debt.

21:22.580 --> 21:23.751
Please, Your Honor,

21:23.800 --> 21:25.313
do we need the speeches?No, we don't.

21:25.370 --> 21:26.928
Counselor,
is there a question here?

21:26.980 --> 21:28.925
Nothing further.President Stenborg,

21:28.980 --> 21:30.845
you make it sound
like you don't care

21:30.890 --> 21:32.755
about the quality
of the education.

21:32.810 --> 21:34.414
Is that true?No.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.849
I care very much.

21:36.900 --> 21:39.812
But I also care about running
a successful business.

21:39.860 --> 21:42.909
SCHMIDT: You
supplying a serwce.Yes.

21:42.950 --> 21:45.908
Traditionally,
higher education is a product

21:45.950 --> 21:47.736
marketed only to the elite.

21:47.780 --> 21:50.738
And you're making it
available to the masses?Exactly.

21:50.780 --> 21:53.954
If we didn't do it,
these students would never get

21:54.000 --> 21:55.865
into another institution.Do you mislead

21:55.920 --> 21:57.820
prospective students?

21:57.880 --> 21:59.916
No. We're not allowed to.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.528
We're subject

22:01.580 --> 22:03.832
to the same laws every
business must follow.

22:03.880 --> 22:06.405
Our customers
get exactly

22:06.450 --> 22:08.839
what they pay for,
no more, no less.

22:08.890 --> 22:11.791
Okay, I think we can all agree
that Colosseum is not Harvard.

22:11.850 --> 22:14.626
ALICIA: Oh, that's not
what we're claiming.Yes, but you're focusing

22:14.680 --> 22:15.931
on the ways in which Colosseum

22:15.980 --> 22:17.845
doesn't measure up
to traditional notions

22:17.900 --> 22:21.984
of higher education.No, we're focusing
on deceptive practices.

22:22.030 --> 22:23.372
Then I'd suggest
you stop presenting evidence

22:23.420 --> 22:25.240
on Colosseum being inadequate,

22:25.300 --> 22:28.940
and instead focus on the ways
they actually lied

22:28.990 --> 22:31.732
to their students.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.186
Can I help you?

22:52.280 --> 22:53.838
Yeah. I was actually hoping

22:53.890 --> 22:56.529
to rent out these offices,
if they're not occupied.

22:56.590 --> 22:59.320
They're open. Last occupant
just used it as a mail drop,

22:59.370 --> 23:01.156
and he took off
a month ago.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.930
How much square footage
are you looking for?Like 800,

23:03.990 --> 23:05.855
but I'd love to take a look.
Jason Crouse.

23:05.900 --> 23:08.073
I run a skip-tracer business.Sure. Nice to meet you.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.724
Harrison Strode.

23:09.770 --> 23:11.556
I manage this location.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.068
A lot of people like
the prestigious address.

23:15.170 --> 23:17.422
Ah, here we go.

23:21.050 --> 23:23.746
Well, the size is right.

23:23.790 --> 23:26.042
Would you mind getting
those shades for me?

23:26.100 --> 23:27.965
Sure. It's $600 a month,

23:28.010 --> 23:28.999
with utilities.

23:29.050 --> 23:30.267
It's Wi-Fi ready,

23:30.320 --> 23:33.096
and... the view
is not bad.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.422
[phone ringing]

23:54.170 --> 23:56.468
Alicia, how's arbitration?

23:56.520 --> 23:59.080
Not good. You busy?

23:59.130 --> 24:00.734
Neven

24:00.780 --> 24:03.123
The arbiter needs some lies that
Colosseum tells its students.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.340
Can you find something?

24:04.390 --> 24:05.652
Sure. What's the time line?

24:05.700 --> 24:07.179
Tomorrow.

24:07.220 --> 24:09.745
[chuckles] All right.
Let me see what I can do.

24:09.790 --> 24:11.132
Great. Thanks.

24:11.180 --> 24:12.659
[chuckles]:
Good-bye.

24:12.710 --> 24:15.008
Surprise! Marissa!

24:15.060 --> 24:17.699
Hey, what's up?

24:17.760 --> 24:19.148
It's been a while.I know.

24:19.190 --> 24:21.317
Your office looks amazing.
I can't believe

24:21.370 --> 24:23.531
you did this all
without me.I thought you were in Israel.

24:23.590 --> 24:26.548
I was. Designing purses.
Really cool.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.808
Leather and macram.
But then I got worried

24:28.850 --> 24:30.806
my dad was having
a nervous breakdown.

24:30.860 --> 24:33.203
About what? You being away?No.

24:33.250 --> 24:34.899
Do you have any cereal?

24:34.950 --> 24:36.372
Sure.

24:39.950 --> 24:41.736
What was I saying?

24:41.780 --> 24:43.680
Your dad-- you're
worried about him.He's having trouble

24:43.740 --> 24:45.219
letting go.

24:45.260 --> 24:47.785
Running Peter's campaign
was his life.

24:47.830 --> 24:50.173
Well, he's my
chief of staff now.

24:50.220 --> 24:51.824
I know. I heard.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.222
But...

24:53.270 --> 24:55.170
you disapprove?

24:55.230 --> 24:56.447
No. Ijust...

24:56.490 --> 24:58.742
you know...

24:58.800 --> 25:01.052
You're right, I don't approve.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.704
Why?He's about
to pass up

25:02.760 --> 25:05.228
an opportunity to run
a campaign in Israel--

25:05.280 --> 25:06.793
a big campaign--
because of you.

25:06.850 --> 25:09.318
Well, I never guilted Eli into
anything-- he wanted to stay.

25:09.370 --> 25:13.192
I know. And that's why
I'm hoping you'll fire him.

25:13.250 --> 25:16.151
Marissa...That's the only way
he'll move on.

25:16.210 --> 25:18.940
Convince him you don't want him.
I know it's hard on you.

25:18.990 --> 25:21.163
Don't do it for you,
do it for him.

25:21.210 --> 25:23.519
Please fire him.

25:31.960 --> 25:32.608
MAN:
What are you looking

25:32.660 --> 25:33.786
to major in, Jason?

25:33.830 --> 25:35.559
I was thinking
dental hygiene.

25:35.620 --> 25:37.918
Are you guys accredited
with the ADA?

25:37.970 --> 25:40.575
Uh, well, I'll tell you the
truth, right now we're not.

25:40.620 --> 25:43.669
It's pending, but...
You don't want to be
a dental hygienist.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.928
I mean, come on,
look at you, a guy like you?

25:45.970 --> 25:48.313
You like cars?
We got a great
automotive tech program.

25:48.370 --> 25:51.931
Yeah? How do your graduates
do in the workforce?

25:51.980 --> 25:54.448
Uh... uh, look, you know,
I can show you the stats.

25:54.500 --> 25:57.458
We got time for that.
But do you want to
get some lunch?

25:59.160 --> 26:01.685
You know, let me, uh...
let me think about it.

26:01.730 --> 26:03.595
Thank you.Wait, Ja...

26:03.640 --> 26:04.777
uh...

26:04.820 --> 26:06.720
are you a vet?

26:08.390 --> 26:10.290
Yeah. Why?

26:10.350 --> 26:11.692
'Cause I'm about
to make your day.

26:11.740 --> 26:14.083
See, most of our students,
they got to come up

26:14.130 --> 26:16.394
with at least ten percent
of the tuition out of pocket.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.431
But you, you get
the golden ticket.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.438
You got, you got Federal
loans, plus the GI. Bill.

26:21.490 --> 26:23.048
Let me show you.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.613
All right.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.537
You got something.

26:35.070 --> 26:36.549
What?

26:36.590 --> 26:38.933
Ninety-ten.

26:39.940 --> 26:42.283
I have no idea
what that is.

26:42.330 --> 26:44.469
You need to call this
recrUItment officer--

26:44.510 --> 26:46.466
Randy Duffield.What's his number?

26:46.510 --> 26:48.239
No.

26:48.300 --> 26:50.256
Call him as your
next witness.

26:50.300 --> 26:52.029
Mr. Duffield,

26:52.080 --> 26:55.345
can you please tell us
about the 90/10 rule?

26:55.390 --> 26:57.915
It is a Federal law
that prohibits

26:57.960 --> 27:01.134
for-profit colleges
from receiving more than

27:01.180 --> 27:03.910
90% of their revenues
from student aid.

27:03.970 --> 27:06.530
And where does
the other ten percent come from?

27:06.580 --> 27:09.401
From the students themselves.
Their own private funds.

27:09.450 --> 27:11.270
But there's a loophole,
isn't there?

27:11.320 --> 27:12.708
I'm not sure what you mean.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.364
Veterans.
GI. Bill

27:14.410 --> 27:17.368
and DoD Tuition Assistance--
that can be counted

27:17.410 --> 27:19.753
as private money
on the ten percent side.

27:19.810 --> 27:22.631
I'm... not sure_ _
where we're g0ing With this.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.636
Our client, Maggie Rossum,
is a veteran.

27:24.680 --> 27:28.025
ALICIA:
So veterans can go to Colosseum
for no money out of pocket.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.684
Do you target veterans

27:29.730 --> 27:32.426
in order to take advantage
of this 90/ 10 rule?

27:32.470 --> 27:33.949
No.Really?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.070
Did you receive
this e-mail

27:36.130 --> 27:38.382
from Colosseum's
head of recrUItment last year?

27:38.430 --> 27:41.217
It suggests that
you lure veterans

27:41.260 --> 27:44.172
from veteran hospitals
and Wounded Warrior centers.

27:44.220 --> 27:46.302
Objection as to "lure."

27:47.840 --> 27:49.444
Sure.

27:49.490 --> 27:51.708
Find another word for "lure."

27:51.750 --> 27:53.570
Persuade.

27:53.620 --> 27:55.440
Isn't it a fact
that you persuade

27:55.490 --> 27:58.493
poor, unqualified
applicants

27:58.540 --> 28:01.714
to take out_ loans
they can't p055ibly repay?

28:01.760 --> 28:03.751
[chuckles]
That's just not true.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.929
Nothing further.

28:06.980 --> 28:09.323
Mr. Duffield,
is Mrs. Florrick
spinning your words?

28:09.380 --> 28:10.460
[chuckles]:
Yes.

28:10.510 --> 28:12.899
You believe
in what you do?Look,

28:12.950 --> 28:15.510
our students, they-they may not
be the best and the brightest--

28:15.560 --> 28:16.720
I'm sorry to say that,

28:16.780 --> 28:19.999
but it's true--
but it doesn't mean

28:20.040 --> 28:23.510
that they don't
deserve a chance.Thank you.

28:23.570 --> 28:25.515
I'd like to call Maggie Rossum.

28:29.010 --> 28:31.433
Did you or did you not,
Ms. Lockhart,

28:31.490 --> 28:33.094
suggest that
I catheterize myself

28:33.140 --> 28:35.096
at a client meeting
which took place

28:35.140 --> 28:38.143
in this very room
less than a week ago?

28:38.190 --> 28:40.238
You were getting up
to go to the bathroom

28:40.280 --> 28:43.408
every five
minutes, Howard.Answer the question: yes or no?

28:43.460 --> 28:45.621
Howard, we all make jokes,
including you,

28:45.680 --> 28:48.456
about everyone at the firm.I'll take that as a yes.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.980
Cary gets made fun of
for his youthful appearance.Twerp,

28:51.030 --> 28:52.543
pimple, preschooler.And we've all

28:52.600 --> 28:53.760
made fun
of David Lee for...

28:53.810 --> 28:55.209
well, you know.

28:55.250 --> 28:57.115
And I've heard you
more than once joke

28:57.170 --> 28:59.593
about the pole
stuck about Diane's ass.Excuse me?

28:59.650 --> 29:01.777
No. Come on, that...
that's different.

29:01.820 --> 29:05.859
How is that different?I'm not talking about
harmless ribbing.

29:08.310 --> 29:09.868
People...

29:09.920 --> 29:12.787
pour prune juice in my coffee.

29:12.830 --> 29:14.832
They leave adult diapers

29:14.880 --> 29:16.177
in my office.Oh, come on, Howard.

29:16.230 --> 29:18.050
What? They do.No one is leaving

29:18.100 --> 29:19.180
adult diapers in your office,

29:19.230 --> 29:21.790
Howard.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.308
I think he wants us
to follow him.

29:29.330 --> 29:32.197
"Property of Howard Lyman."

29:32.240 --> 29:33.844
Huh?

29:37.860 --> 29:39.816
Oh.

29:39.860 --> 29:41.908
And...

29:41.950 --> 29:43.906
here's a...

29:43.950 --> 29:45.998
a bib...

29:47.080 --> 29:49.036
...and a catheter.

29:49.090 --> 29:50.307
I had nothing to do with that.

29:50.350 --> 29:52.124
But you're creating the climate.

29:52.180 --> 29:55.343
Well, it's a diaper, Howard,
it's not a burning swastika.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.265
These young associates,
they look up to you.

29:57.310 --> 29:59.870
They follow your cues,
and this is what they do.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.831
They harass me. They...

30:01.880 --> 30:04.007
they humiliate me.

30:05.890 --> 30:08.757
Howard, I am so sorry.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.712
And I want you
to know we are gonna
take meaningful steps

30:11.760 --> 30:13.842
_ to correct
this ageist culture

30:13.890 --> 30:16.893
that we may have
unwittingly fostered.

30:19.030 --> 30:22.022
Would you consider yourself
a good student, Ms. Rossum?

30:22.080 --> 30:23.729
I don't know. I...

30:23.770 --> 30:25.556
I did my best.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.942
[chuckles]: Good.

30:26.990 --> 30:28.867
That's all
any of us can hope for--

30:28.910 --> 30:31.253
doing our best.

30:31.300 --> 30:32.904
Now, in order
to do your best,

30:32.960 --> 30:34.257
you would need
to show up for...

30:34.310 --> 30:35.345
classes, right?

30:35.390 --> 30:36.823
Would you agree to that?

30:36.870 --> 30:38.952
Well, that depends.It does? You think

30:39.010 --> 30:41.786
you can be a good student even
if you don't show up for class?

30:41.840 --> 30:43.740
I would object to that,
Mr. Solomon.

30:43.790 --> 30:45.519
I understand why,
but no.

30:45.580 --> 30:49.095
I think that you
can be a good student
in a lot of ways.

30:49.150 --> 30:50.276
I understand
why you would say that.

30:50.320 --> 30:51.628
According to your
attendance records,

30:51.670 --> 30:54.889
you missed two-thirds
of your classes.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.714
Do you think that's
accurate, or...

30:56.760 --> 30:58.068
do you think
it's wrong?

31:00.110 --> 31:03.284
I had to work a lot
to pay my bills.

31:03.330 --> 31:05.946
What about books, the
ones assigned for class?

31:05.990 --> 31:08.458
Did you... buy any?

31:08.510 --> 31:10.899
Did I buy any textbooks?

31:10.950 --> 31:12.645
No, but I...SCHMIDT: Wow!

31:12.690 --> 31:13.998
So aside from tuition,

31:14.040 --> 31:15.473
what did you spend
all that student loan money on?

31:15.520 --> 31:17.829
They told me I could use
that money for living expenses.

31:17.870 --> 31:19.349
SCHMIDT: Living expenses
incurred while you weren't

31:19.390 --> 31:21.699
buying books or
attending classes.

31:21.740 --> 31:24.789
Looks more like a defective user
than a defective product.

31:24.830 --> 31:26.832
Objection!Objection!

31:26.880 --> 31:28.313
He made it sound really bad.

31:28.360 --> 31:31.227
That's because it is
really bad, Maggie.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.440
The credit card
interest was

31:32.490 --> 31:33.536
eating me alive--
paying off

31:33.580 --> 31:34.399
that card seemed like

31:34.450 --> 31:35.758
the smart thing to do. I...

31:35.800 --> 31:36.880
And it wasn't illegal.

31:36.930 --> 31:38.010
Well, maybe not.

31:38.070 --> 31:39.401
But it still
doesn't look good.

31:39.460 --> 31:40.802
Did I miss classes?
Yes.

31:40.850 --> 31:44.104
But that's because
I was working two jobs.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.378
And I always got
notes from somebody
when I couldn't make it.

31:46.420 --> 31:48.411
What about the books?We'd get
PDF versions,

31:48.470 --> 31:50.199
print them out, pass
them around. I mean...

31:50.250 --> 31:52.036
we all tried to make
the best of it,

31:52.080 --> 31:54.640
we really did.

31:54.690 --> 31:56.078
Who's "we"?

31:56.130 --> 31:57.939
Um, my study group.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.218
We'd just kind of
share horror stories,

32:00.260 --> 32:02.512
you know, job tips,
that kind of thing.

32:02.570 --> 32:04.697
How many students?

32:04.740 --> 32:07.004
[indistinct chatter]

32:07.050 --> 32:08.699
Look, we just need

32:08.750 --> 32:11.526
to enumerate ways
Colosseum lied to you.

32:11.580 --> 32:14.447
[lively chatter]

32:16.890 --> 32:18.619
We just need to wait.

32:20.590 --> 32:23.104
I see you're running
an adult day care now.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.106
You wanted
to talk?Yes.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.411
[chatter continues]

32:29.590 --> 32:31.148
[door closes]

32:31.210 --> 32:33.553
I'll get right
to the point, Eli.

32:33.600 --> 32:36.421
I just don't trust you anymore.

32:36.470 --> 32:38.995
I need to be working
with someone...

32:39.040 --> 32:40.382
different...

32:40.430 --> 32:42.421
someone who
gets along with Ruth,

32:42.480 --> 32:44.471
who has her confidence.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.789
Did Marissa talk to you?

32:48.830 --> 32:49.876
No.

32:51.090 --> 32:54.173
Eli... you have
an ulterior motive here,

32:54.230 --> 32:56.573
and you know it--
you are using me.

32:56.620 --> 32:59.441
Yes, but... you're
using me, too.

32:59.490 --> 33:02.539
I keep Ruth from
messing with your life.

33:02.580 --> 33:06.584
Well, I can do that on my own.
No, Eli.

33:06.630 --> 33:09.542
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me,

33:09.590 --> 33:12.058
but now...

33:12.120 --> 33:14.543
we need to part ways.

33:14.600 --> 33:17.068
You're serious?

33:17.120 --> 33:19.588
Yes.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.904
We both need a fresh start.

33:21.950 --> 33:24.384
I know it won't be easy, but...

33:24.430 --> 33:27.604
it's time.

33:32.090 --> 33:34.615
Good-bye, Eli.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.354
[overlapping chatter
continues in distance]

33:43.580 --> 33:45.889
No, I agree.

33:45.930 --> 33:47.921
I think maybe a class action
makes sense.
Wait.

33:47.980 --> 33:49.936
I'm not sure
if we have the wherewithal...

33:49.980 --> 33:51.675
Actually, a class action
isn't possible here.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.540
Why is that?[indistinct,
overlapping chatter]

33:53.590 --> 33:55.933
The enrollme_nt
agreement you Signed.

33:55.990 --> 33:58.242
ALICIA:
When you registered
at Colosseum,

33:58.290 --> 34:00.895
you signed a document saying
you wouldn't sue the school.

34:00.950 --> 34:03.680
I signed a hundred pieces
of paper.Are you serious?!

34:03.730 --> 34:05.903
We can really
sign away our rights?

34:05.950 --> 34:08.475
LUCCA:
Unfortunately, yeah,
legally, you can.

34:08.520 --> 34:10.988
MAGGIE:
Okay, so the school
can screw all of us,

34:11.040 --> 34:13.474
and then tric_k us into _
not d0ing anything about it?

34:13.520 --> 34:15.602
[overlapping chatter]

34:17.830 --> 34:22.529
A class action suit isn't
possible, but a debt strike is.

34:22.580 --> 34:24.832
It's already happening
at another for-profit.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.314
Corinthian College.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.624
[chatter continuing]

34:32.720 --> 34:36.542
This is a list of 350
Colosseum graduates

34:36.590 --> 34:37.932
who are ready
to default collectively

34:37.980 --> 34:39.629
and suffer the consequences,

34:39.680 --> 34:42.069
unless you intervene with
the Department of Education

34:42.120 --> 34:45.203
and the loan companies
to settle their debts.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.729
Really? Getting
desperate, are we?

34:46.780 --> 34:48.554
It's a debt strike.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.682
Let's see how that will
play With your resale value.

34:52.780 --> 34:54.645
LUCCA:
Or you can settle.

34:54.700 --> 34:55.951
We're listening.

35:02.180 --> 35:04.136
WOMAN:
Okay, now I need everyone

35:04.180 --> 35:06.796
to take the cotton balls
in front of you.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.308
Pick one up, please.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.885
Just one.

35:11.930 --> 35:14.842
Okay, now insert it into

35:14.890 --> 35:17.142
your right nostril, please.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.158
Good and tight.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.767
Okay, now take the
cardboard glasses...

35:25.810 --> 35:28.688
Look at him.
He's enjoying himself.

35:28.730 --> 35:31.164
They're coated with
a diffused filter.

35:31.210 --> 35:34.384
And put them over
your eyes, please.

35:34.430 --> 35:37.388
Now take the
kernels of corn.

35:37.430 --> 35:39.569
A handful will do.

35:39.610 --> 35:42.170
And put them
in each shoe.

35:42.220 --> 35:44.085
Come on.

35:44.140 --> 35:47.041
Sensitivity training.
Let's be sensitive.

35:47.100 --> 35:49.261
Ah, you know what?

35:49.320 --> 35:51.003
I think
Howard planted those diapers,

35:51.060 --> 35:52.664
so we would have to do this.

35:52.710 --> 35:54.928
Here we go.
WOMAN:
Good.

35:54.970 --> 35:59.236
Now I want
everyone to walk.

35:59.280 --> 36:03.842
And do something simple
like tie your shoes. Go.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.936
Oh.

36:05.980 --> 36:07.936
It hurts.

36:07.990 --> 36:11.153
WOMAN:
This is What it's like
to be 80 years old.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.986
This is What
it's like to walk.

36:14.040 --> 36:15.814
Isn't that right,

36:15.860 --> 36:17.259
Howard?

36:17.300 --> 36:20.121
Sometimes...
every day is a struggle.

36:20.170 --> 36:23.697
I'm sorry I take naps,
but now you know why.

36:23.740 --> 36:25.696
All... all day, it hurts.

36:25.740 --> 36:27.469
[cries]

36:27.530 --> 36:30.135
WOMAN:
I think Howard could use
all of your support right now.

36:30.180 --> 36:31.659
[groans]

36:34.360 --> 36:36.794
This is not happening.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.536
PETER: I think unions
do have a place.

36:39.580 --> 36:41.719
But if we're gonna
staycompetitive

36:41.760 --> 36:43.933
in a global economy, then,

36:43.980 --> 36:45.322
I think we have to look

36:45.370 --> 36:46.758
beyond the standard
management-labor paradigm.

36:46.810 --> 36:48.027
MAN: Excuse me.
Excuse me, guys.

36:48.070 --> 36:49.799
[reporters clamoring]

36:49.850 --> 36:51.989
Then you agree with your
husband, Mrs. Florrick?

36:52.030 --> 36:53.759
I do.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.503
I think creative solutions
are essential.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.505
So you're
against unions?
No.

36:57.560 --> 37:00.074
But I support my husband
When he says

37:00.130 --> 37:01.859
he's looking for new ways
to avoid strikes.

37:01.910 --> 37:04.606
Then what do you think of
your wife's debt strike,
Mr. Governor?

37:04.650 --> 37:06.299
RUTH: Mr. Governor,
I think we have

37:06.350 --> 37:07.908
to get into the ballroom.Actually, you don't.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.609
Your wife is
organizing a debt strike

37:09.660 --> 37:11.264
among the students at
Colosseum University.

37:11.310 --> 37:13.039
Well, I support my wife.Even though she's unionizing?

37:13.100 --> 37:15.045
I would rather
look at the facts...

37:15.100 --> 37:17.261
You are organizing a strike,
aren't you, Mrs. Florrick?

37:17.320 --> 37:19.447
Unfortunately, attorney-client
privilege prevents me

37:19.490 --> 37:21.276
from saying...I think
we've had enough here.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.278
Oh, it's okay for your wife
to strike, but not my union?

37:24.320 --> 37:27.403
You gave Alicia the debt
strike idea, didn't you?

37:27.460 --> 37:29.678
You know Peter told me to
keep a handle on the family,

37:29.720 --> 37:31.676
and now we've got Alicia
stirring up trouble

37:31.720 --> 37:33.676
on an issue that's_
no-WIn for the campaign!

37:33.720 --> 37:35.938
It's not no-Win _
for the campaign...Peter can't be saying

37:35.990 --> 37:38.072
"Vote for me" in one breath,
and "Don't worry

37:38.120 --> 37:39.940
about paying back the
federal government" in the next.

37:39.990 --> 37:42.163
Oh. You know, you're right.
I didn't think of that.

37:42.210 --> 37:44.030
I guess
he won't want to choose between

37:44.080 --> 37:45.684
alienating the unions
or business interests, either.

37:45.740 --> 37:47.640
[hoarse whisper]:
You're killing Peter's campaign!

37:47.700 --> 37:50.919
No, I'm not. I'm not
runningPeter's campaign.

38:02.140 --> 38:04.574
Mr. Naftali, Eli Gold.

38:04.630 --> 38:06.052
Oh, I'm-I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize

38:06.100 --> 38:07.920
it was so late With you there.

38:07.980 --> 38:10.585
I've given your offer
a lot of thought,

38:10.630 --> 38:13.098
and, uh, as tempting as it is...

38:13.160 --> 38:15.287
I'm gonna stay put.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.634
[knocking on door]

38:19.680 --> 38:21.329
Molly Tuff?

38:21.380 --> 38:23.029
Yes?

38:23.080 --> 38:24.729
Colosseum class of 2013?

38:24.780 --> 38:26.850
Yeah. Who are you?

38:26.910 --> 38:29.947
I think this is yours.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.865
It's your payment
on your student loan.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.218
How'd you get it?

38:33.260 --> 38:34.818
From the person
Who scammed you.

38:34.870 --> 38:36.121
I'm a private investigator.

38:36.180 --> 38:38.171
I have a client who fell
for the same scam.

38:38.220 --> 38:40.222
Sent her payment
to that address, too.

38:40.270 --> 38:41.828
I can't believe
you got it back.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.269
[laughs] I never have
luck like this.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.402
Oh, my God.

38:46.450 --> 38:51.149
What?
They just called
yesterday with a new address.

38:51.190 --> 38:54.239
Can I get that address from you?

39:20.480 --> 39:22.391
[door bell jingles]

39:25.840 --> 39:27.182
Hello, jackass.

39:27.230 --> 39:28.788
[engine starting]

40:12.270 --> 40:13.271
[knocks twice]

40:18.280 --> 40:20.748
[door squeaks open]

40:31.770 --> 40:34.238
Eli. Hi.

40:34.300 --> 40:36.461
I'm staying on.

40:39.210 --> 40:42.259
Okay. Sounds good.

40:42.300 --> 40:44.256
[knocking on door]

40:49.050 --> 40:50.392
Mrs. Florrick,

40:50.440 --> 40:52.089
I apologize if
I'm interrupting.

40:52.140 --> 40:53.528
What do you need, Mr. Schmidt?

40:53.580 --> 40:56.925
Just to deliver this.
Colosseum is sumg

40:56.970 --> 41:00.189
you and Lucca Quinn for tortious
interference With contract.

41:08.680 --> 41:12.059
A judge Will probably
knock this down.I don't think so.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.542
There's a colorable argument
that we crossed a line

41:13.600 --> 41:15.852
When we encouraged students
not to pay back their debt.

41:15.900 --> 41:19.518
We escalated, so, they escalated
further, and now we need to...

41:19.560 --> 41:21.869
Keep going.
No, I was gonna
say deescalate.

41:21.910 --> 41:23.605
JASON:
Lucca's right.

41:23.650 --> 41:26.255
The debt strike is working.
Colosseum stock is falling.

41:26.300 --> 41:29.736
Colosseum has not been willing
to back down so far.

41:31.140 --> 41:33.131
Not to us.

41:33.180 --> 41:34.738
But What if it was someone
they cared about even more,

41:34.790 --> 41:37.350
that was applying the pressure?

41:37.400 --> 41:39.265
You don't happen
to know anything

41:39.320 --> 41:41.049
about this shareholder
derivative suit

41:41.100 --> 41:43.182
that's been filed
against us, do you?

41:43.230 --> 41:46.142
Absolutely
not, but...

41:46.190 --> 41:49.102
ifI had to guess,
I'd say the theory is

41:49.150 --> 41:52.062
that Colosseum's predatory
recruitment tactics

41:52.110 --> 41:53.543
are a violation of the school's

41:53.590 --> 41:56.411
fiduciary duty
towards its shareholders.

41:56.470 --> 41:58.199
Am I right?

41:58.250 --> 42:00.115
Uncanny.

42:00.160 --> 42:02.208
LUCCA: Just to recap, you're
now facing a debt strike

42:02.250 --> 42:04.252
Which is destroying
your not-very-good name,

42:04.300 --> 42:07.258
a shareholder suit Which
could bankrupt you in court,

42:07.300 --> 42:08.858
and if either continues,

42:08.910 --> 42:11.219
the Feds are going to
investigate and revoke

42:11.260 --> 42:14.218
your eligibility to
receive funding.

42:14.270 --> 42:16.215
What do you want?

42:18.100 --> 42:20.318
[doorbell rings]

42:22.710 --> 42:24.666
Hi.

42:24.710 --> 42:26.575
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

42:26.630 --> 42:28.621
I-I just wanted to
drop something off.

42:28.670 --> 42:31.366
What is it?
Belongs to Maggie.

42:31.410 --> 42:34.231
Her $8,000?

42:34.290 --> 42:35.587
Yeah.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.107
From the scammer?

42:37.160 --> 42:38.639
Yeah.

42:38.680 --> 42:40.284
How did you do that?

42:40.340 --> 42:42.592
I persuaded him.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.688
How?

42:44.730 --> 42:47.381
By being persuasive.

42:47.430 --> 42:50.513
You're not gonna tell me,
are you?

42:50.560 --> 42:52.994
I will tell you
Whatever you want to know.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.042
Oh.

42:55.090 --> 42:57.866
I get to the end of the day,
I'm so tired, sometimes I...

42:57.920 --> 43:00.138
can't think straight.

43:00.180 --> 43:02.000
That is why I drink.

43:02.050 --> 43:04.746
[both laugh gently]

43:04.790 --> 43:06.792
What do you drink?
