00:08.342 --> 00:11.505
In the third match of the Tenkaichi Budokai,

00:11.720 --> 00:15.588
a showdown between
Videl and Spopovitch began.

00:15.808 --> 00:18.675
Having received training from Gohan,

00:18.894 --> 00:22.933
Videl should have easily
obtained victory. However...

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074

00:31.073 --> 00:39.071
Just what sort of mystery lies
behind Spopovitch's eerie strength?

00:52.553 --> 00:56.091
W-What kind of guy is this?

01:12.531 --> 01:16.615
Contestant Videl goes down!
Was that the clinching blow?!

01:22.416 --> 01:25.749
Oh, my! Contestant Videl has not given up yet!

01:25.961 --> 01:29.670
With indomitable spirit,
she is trying to get up again!

01:29.882 --> 01:33.170
L-Like I'll ever give up!

03:03.225 --> 03:08.390
"Videl Battered--Gohan's Fury
Reaches Its Limit!!"

03:18.532 --> 03:20.022
What?!

03:39.511 --> 03:41.012
Th-That's awful!

03:41.221 --> 03:42.677
W-What a monster!

03:42.890 --> 03:44.005
Stop it, already!

03:44.224 --> 03:47.466
At this rate, he'll disfigure Videl's face!

03:47.686 --> 03:50.928
It doesn't look like she's
going to get off that easily!

04:04.411 --> 04:06.242
Stop mocking me!

04:09.750 --> 04:12.833
Contestant Spopovitch has
flung Contestant Videl away!

04:13.045 --> 04:16.082
This could be it! A ringout defeat!

04:18.132 --> 04:22.502
|-|t's no use... I don't have
enough strength left to fly...

04:33.565 --> 04:36.056
Oh, my! Contestant Spopovitch
rescued Contestant Videl

04:36.276 --> 04:41.396
from a ringout defeat!
Just what could he be thinking?!

04:44.242 --> 04:45.618
Videl-san...!

04:45.827 --> 04:48.785
Tch! He's just toying with her!

04:49.790 --> 04:52.452
However, Contestant Videl is not getting up.

04:52.668 --> 04:57.002
Has she been knocked out?
Reluctantly, I will begin a count!

04:57.214 --> 05:01.799
This is good. Yes, this is good.
She's better off unconscious.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.750
Hey, that's enough!

05:03.971 --> 05:05.836
Stop, already!

05:06.056 --> 05:07.796
What are you doing?!

05:09.351 --> 05:11.182
Get it together!

05:17.567 --> 05:20.149
Don't get up! You can't get up!

05:25.784 --> 05:29.493
Oh, she's up! Contestant Videl
has gotten back up!

05:29.705 --> 05:32.947
What extraordinary mettle!
What magnificent strength of will!

05:33.166 --> 05:34.952
She got up...

05:45.262 --> 05:50.598
That's crazy! He's not a
normal person! Give up already!

05:55.605 --> 05:57.436
V-Videl-san!

06:12.414 --> 06:14.120
Th-This is appalling!

06:14.332 --> 06:17.699
Contestant Spopovitch is beating
Contestant Videl black and blue!

06:21.298 --> 06:23.539
Th-That bastard...!

06:24.843 --> 06:28.677
Th-That's enough! Please give up, Videl-san!

06:50.702 --> 06:54.035
They said my opponent for
the first round is a woman, huh?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.954
When I win, if I strike too gutsy a victory pose,

06:57.167 --> 06:59.123
it may come off like I'm rubbing it in.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.920
And if I do this, I'll be kissing up
to the spectators too much.

07:04.132 --> 07:08.125
Hmm, having a woman as an opponent
makes this pretty difficult.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.670
M-Mister Satan!

07:11.890 --> 07:16.554
Videl-san is getting her
clock cleaned by Spopovitch!

07:16.770 --> 07:18.010
Don't misspeak.

07:18.230 --> 07:22.564
You mean Spopovitch is getting
his clock cleaned by Videl, right?

07:23.652 --> 07:25.438
No, I don't mean that.

07:25.654 --> 07:29.238
I am extremely busy right now!
Never mind the progress reports,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.064
just let me know the final outcome!

07:31.284 --> 07:33.240
The outcome where Videl has won!

07:33.453 --> 07:35.114
O-Okay...

07:35.330 --> 07:39.448
I'll bet Videl-san's match is
over by now. That's a shame.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.660
It's all right. Videl is going to last
until the championship match,

07:42.879 --> 07:44.915
so we'll see plenty of matches
with her in them.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.716
Bad news! Bad news!
Videl-san is getting beaten to a pulp!

07:48.927 --> 07:49.916
She's what?!

07:50.137 --> 07:54.380
Come quickly! We'll cheer for Videl
to get her to take heart!

07:54.599 --> 07:56.100
Yeah!

08:29.467 --> 08:32.254
D-Damn it, man! Stop it, already!

08:32.470 --> 08:35.086
Videl-chan is gonna get killed!

08:52.240 --> 08:57.780
You've fought hard enough!
Give up! Give up, Videl-san!

09:03.126 --> 09:08.541
V-Videl-san, l have to agree
with what Great Saiyaman said.

09:08.757 --> 09:12.341
A-Are you sure you shouldn't give up?

09:12.552 --> 09:14.258
N-No...!

09:16.097 --> 09:18.554
l-l'll never give up!

09:18.767 --> 09:24.933
W-Why are you being so stubborn?!
You really are going to get killed!

09:25.148 --> 09:26.763
That guy doesn't have the kind of feelings

09:26.983 --> 09:29.895
that make him hold back when fighting a girl!

10:02.227 --> 10:06.061
Th-That was cruel! How could he do that?!

10:19.452 --> 10:26.073
H-Hey, Gohan, calm down!
It's all right! She ain't gonna die!

10:41.933 --> 10:43.764
V-Videl!

10:43.977 --> 10:45.558
Damn him!

10:45.770 --> 10:49.854
Why, you...! You take this any further,
and I'll arrest you!

10:50.066 --> 10:53.433
Th-This is brutal! Contestant Spopovitch
is behaving in ways

10:53.653 --> 10:55.735
that I can't even consider human!

10:57.115 --> 11:00.027
|-|s there nothin' anyone can do?!

11:00.243 --> 11:01.858
The way things are headed,

11:02.078 --> 11:05.115
that girl is goin' to die
before she can marry Gohan!

11:05.332 --> 11:06.822
Gohan!

11:15.800 --> 11:24.424
N-No! |-| don't want to... I don't want to lose...!

11:29.439 --> 11:35.400
Why, you...! I can't take it anymore,
you filthy punk!

11:48.708 --> 11:50.084
H-Hey!

11:50.293 --> 11:53.126
You can't do this! Calm down, Gohan!

11:53.338 --> 11:54.828
No!

12:01.596 --> 12:03.507
Stop it!

12:03.723 --> 12:06.715
That's enough playing around, Spopovitch.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.688
Carrying on like that
isn't what we're here to do.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.530
Hurry up and win already!

12:22.742 --> 12:25.154
Y-Yeah...

12:30.083 --> 12:35.168
R-R-Ringout!
Contestant Spopovitch is the winner.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.679
V-Videl-san...

12:46.307 --> 12:49.299
Um, shall I call for a stretcher?

12:49.519 --> 12:52.386
No. l'll carry her.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.189
Spopovitch!

13:03.283 --> 13:07.196
You'll pay for this! I'll see to it!

13:07.412 --> 13:08.902
You got that?!

13:20.175 --> 13:22.416
Does anyone have any senzu beans?

13:22.635 --> 13:25.968
No. We mostly came here for the fun of it, so...

13:26.181 --> 13:28.092
No, huh?

13:28.308 --> 13:32.517
All right, |'|| head over to Karin-sama
and get some from him.

13:36.191 --> 13:40.150
You can relax, Gohan! Goku just
took off to get some senzu beans.

13:40.361 --> 13:44.525
Senzu? Oh, yeah! That's great!

13:55.168 --> 13:57.329
W-W-What?!

13:57.545 --> 14:00.082
Videl lost, and is seriously injured?!

14:00.298 --> 14:01.083
Y-Yes...

14:01.299 --> 14:05.884
That's impossible! Videl is the
strongest person in the world,

14:06.095 --> 14:09.053
next to me! That fool! She got
so caught up in her techniques,

14:09.265 --> 14:11.722
she must have dropped her guard! Move it!

14:11.935 --> 14:13.971
Videl!

14:17.565 --> 14:20.307
Videl! Videl!

14:20.527 --> 14:22.358
V-Videl!

14:25.657 --> 14:28.273
Th-This is awful...

14:28.493 --> 14:31.781
It's all right. They said her life
wasn't in any danger.

14:31.996 --> 14:35.955
Who the hell are you?! Are you the one
who did this to my daughter?!

14:36.167 --> 14:37.998
No, he isn't.

14:38.211 --> 14:42.329
This is the one who was
kind enough to carry her here.

14:42.549 --> 14:47.589
H-He did? That's right. Her opponent
was Spopovitch, wasn't it?

14:47.804 --> 14:52.423
G-Good work. I'll give you an autograph later.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.598
Sure... Thanks...

14:54.811 --> 14:57.348
Okay, you're in the way here,
so you can go now.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.304
R-Right.

15:01.526 --> 15:04.643
G-Gohan-kun...

15:05.822 --> 15:07.983
Hmm?

15:08.199 --> 15:12.863
C-Clobber that guy... for me...

15:13.079 --> 15:16.162
Mm-hmm. Once I win this coming match,

15:16.374 --> 15:18.490
I'll meet him in the second round.

15:29.012 --> 15:31.219
W-What are you talking about?!

15:31.431 --> 15:34.093
He's far too much for
that nutcase kid to handle!

15:34.309 --> 15:37.392
Papa will be the one who
takes care of Spopovitch!

15:37.604 --> 15:40.516
So you just get your rest, Videl.

15:50.617 --> 15:54.530
l-lt can't be! You two aren't an item, are you?!

15:54.746 --> 15:58.455
|-| won't have it! Not that ridiculously
weak-looking guy, of all people!

15:58.666 --> 16:00.531
A-Aren't | always saying

16:00.752 --> 16:04.540
you can't have any boyfriends
unless they're stronger than I am?!

16:04.756 --> 16:07.463
--Come on!
--Keep it quiet.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.012
What's keeping him?

16:32.492 --> 16:33.902
Father is taking a while, huh?

16:34.118 --> 16:36.074
Yeah. With his Instantaneous Movement,

16:36.287 --> 16:38.198
he should be back immediately.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.281
It could be that there are no
senzu beans at Karin Tower.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.583
D-Don't say that, Kuririn-san!

16:43.795 --> 16:46.332
I'm going to go see how
Videl-san is doing again.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.378
Once Father gets back, please send him there.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.092
You know, Gohan...

16:51.552 --> 16:52.541
I'm just saying,

16:52.762 --> 16:57.176
this doesn't look like you're worrying
over just any friend, you dog.

17:02.605 --> 17:06.348
l-l'm not going to give up...!

17:06.567 --> 17:11.277
Spopovitch did this to Videl?
What's going on here?!

17:11.489 --> 17:13.525
I can't believe it.

17:15.034 --> 17:20.404
Satan! Satan! Satan!...

17:30.341 --> 17:35.051
Spopovitch-kun, for you to have
to face me in the first match,

17:35.263 --> 17:38.630
you must be conducting yourself
pretty poorly in your normal life.

17:38.850 --> 17:39.965
You should take a lesson from me

17:40.184 --> 17:42.971
and be an example of a
good little boy from now on.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.348
What?! Screw you!

17:57.076 --> 17:59.283
Have you had enough yet?

18:01.622 --> 18:03.158
Damn it!

18:07.462 --> 18:10.078
Contestant Mister Satan is the winner!

18:10.298 --> 18:14.587
Videl, you must have taken
Spopovitch far too lightly, right?

18:14.802 --> 18:18.135
Like I've always told you,
false security is the greatest enemy!

18:18.347 --> 18:20.474
What am I going to do with you?

18:20.683 --> 18:24.892
And don't tell me it's because you
started seeing that scrawny boy!

18:25.104 --> 18:27.311
Feh! I absolutely forbid it!

18:27.523 --> 18:28.899
Gohan-kun...

18:29.108 --> 18:30.609
What?!

18:35.490 --> 18:38.152
Videl! Videl!

18:38.367 --> 18:40.699
Hey, are you sure she's all right?!

18:40.912 --> 18:44.245
She's fine. It will take time,
but she's in no mortal danger--

18:44.457 --> 18:48.746
If anything happens to Videl,
you'll answer to me!

18:48.961 --> 18:50.872
Mister Satan! Mister Satan!

18:51.088 --> 18:52.589
This is Nasshi, the reporter!

18:52.799 --> 18:54.380
We're terribly sorry to bother you
while you're occupied,

18:54.592 --> 18:57.504
but what is Videl-san's condition?

18:57.720 --> 18:59.256
Begging your pardon...

19:09.607 --> 19:12.064
H-How is Videl-san doing?

19:12.276 --> 19:16.019
Videl is the daughter of the
world champion, Mister Satan!

19:16.239 --> 19:19.151
She has been trained a lot
harder than anyone around!

19:19.367 --> 19:21.278
There's nothing to worry about,
so go on and beat it.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.234
I won't be giving any more autographs today.

19:23.454 --> 19:27.288
Um, do you have anything
to say to Spopovitch?

19:27.500 --> 19:31.334
I, Mister Satan, will make sure
to pay him back for my daughter.

19:31.546 --> 19:34.333
You tell Spopovitch I said, "Just you wait!"

19:34.549 --> 19:38.292
I'm going to turn him
inside-out and upside-down!

19:38.511 --> 19:41.048
--Just a moment, please!
--One more word, please!

19:42.640 --> 19:44.176
There are so many people there.

19:44.392 --> 19:47.054
It doesn't look like I can
get into the first-aid room.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.640
Next up is Gohan, at last!

19:54.861 --> 19:57.102
His opponent is someone named Kibito.

19:57.321 --> 20:01.405
"Kibito" or "Shibito" [dead body],
it don't matter. My Gohan is goin' to win.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.950
Yeah, that's for sure.
Gohan will easily beat him.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.242
He's a frontrunner for
the championship match.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.366
Goku-sa IS a frontrunner, tOO.

20:08.583 --> 20:11.541
That prize money is comin' to my house!

20:11.752 --> 20:14.334
Gohan! Good luck!

20:14.547 --> 20:16.458
Chichi-san, it's supposed to be a secret

20:16.674 --> 20:18.665
that Gohan is the Great Saiyaman, right?

20:18.885 --> 20:22.343
Whoops! I completely forgot!

20:23.598 --> 20:28.183
Spopovitch, it could be
these next guys. Stay sharp.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.804
It's all right.

20:30.021 --> 20:33.184
As long as we have this, we'll know in a flash.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.355
I'd like to get this taken care of quickly.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.683
Yeah.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.315
Kibito, look lively, if you please.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.031
Right.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.278
Father is still over there?

20:45.494 --> 20:48.327
Yeah. What could he be doing?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.246
Here are the senzu.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.419
Thank you, Karin-sama.

20:57.632 --> 21:02.672
Incidentally, do not let
your guard down, Goku.

21:04.055 --> 21:07.138
I'm starting to get another
bad feeling about things.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.840
Mm-hmm.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.471
So am I.

21:11.687 --> 21:16.647
What is this "bad feeling"
that Karin-sama is also getting?

21:16.859 --> 21:20.147
Can it be that something epic
is lying in store for them

21:20.363 --> 21:25.232
during the rest of the Tenkaichi Budokai?

22:42.570 --> 22:44.526
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:44.739 --> 22:48.448
What's wrong, Gohan? You could
defeat those guys easily, right?

22:48.659 --> 22:49.990
W-What?!

22:50.202 --> 22:54.036
