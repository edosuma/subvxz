>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:37.426 --> 00:38.659
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:38.659 --> 00:39.559
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:39.559 --> 00:40.759
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:40.759 --> 00:41.726
US.

00:41.726 --> 00:43.093
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:43.093 --> 00:44.926
THE WEEK, AND IT WAS ACTUALLY

00:44.926 --> 00:47.226
SOMEWHAT SLOW FOR THE TRUMP

00:47.226 --> 00:48.592
WHITE HOUSE IN THAT IT ONLY SAW

00:48.592 --> 00:50.160
THE FALLOUT OF A PORN STAR'S

00:50.160 --> 00:51.093
"60 MINUTES" INTERVIEW, A SPEECH

00:51.093 --> 00:52.360
FEATURING A SEEMINGLY AD-LIBBED

00:52.360 --> 00:53.626
REVERSAL OF OUR ENTIRE MILITARY

00:53.626 --> 00:55.026
STRATEGY IN SYRIA, AND YET

00:55.026 --> 00:56.059
ANOTHER CABINET-LEVEL DEPARTURE

00:56.059 --> 00:57.193
WITH THE FIRING OF

00:57.193 --> 00:58.993
VA SECRETARY DAVID SHULKIN.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.426
BUT DON'T WORRY

01:01.426 --> 01:04.093
ABOUT THAT ONE.

01:04.093 --> 01:06.226
TRUMP HAD A REPLACEMENT LINED

01:06.226 --> 01:08.659
UP, AND HE SEARCHED EVERYWHERE

01:08.659 --> 01:09.692
WITHIN 12 FEET OF HIM TO

01:09.692 --> 01:10.826
APPOINT HIS OWN WHITE HOUSE

01:10.826 --> 01:11.926
DOCTOR, WHO YOU MAY RECALL FROM

01:11.926 --> 01:12.959
HIS SUSPICIOUSLY RINGING

01:12.959 --> 01:14.260
ENDORSEMENT OF TRUMP'S HEALTH.

01:14.260 --> 01:14.826
>> THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH IS

01:14.826 --> 01:15.393
EXCELLENT.

01:15.393 --> 01:16.692
HIS OVERALL HEALTH IS EXCELLENT.

01:16.692 --> 01:17.193
HE HAS INCREDIBLE GENES.

01:17.193 --> 01:18.093
I TOLD THE PRESIDENT IF HE HAD A

01:18.093 --> 01:22.393
HEALTHIER DIET OVER THE LAST

01:22.393 --> 01:22.959
20 YEARS, HE MIGHT LIVE

01:22.959 --> 01:23.692
TILL 200 YEARS.

01:23.692 --> 01:24.326
I THINK HE WILL REMAIN FIT FOR

01:24.326 --> 01:25.393
DUTY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS

01:25.393 --> 01:26.626
TERM AND A SECOND TERM IF HE IS

01:26.626 --> 01:27.592
ELECTED.

01:27.592 --> 01:28.692
>> John: HOLD ON, DOC.

01:28.692 --> 01:29.726
FIRST, TRUMP'S HEALTH IS NOT

01:29.726 --> 01:31.226
EXCELLENT.

01:31.226 --> 01:31.993
THAT'S A DIAGNOSIS ANY GOOGLE

01:31.993 --> 01:34.126
IMAGE SEARCH COULD MAKE.

01:34.126 --> 01:36.426
AND SECONDLY, HE ABSOLUTELY DOES

01:36.426 --> 01:38.592
NOT HAVE INCREDIBLE GENES.

01:38.592 --> 01:39.759
WE'VE HAD IRREFUTABLE

01:39.759 --> 01:41.226
EVIDENCE OF THAT FOR THE PAST

01:41.226 --> 01:45.293
40 YEARS.

01:45.293 --> 01:47.026
BUT, LOOK, LET'S NOT GET SUCKED

01:47.026 --> 01:48.026
INTO TRUMP'S GRAVITATIONAL FORCE

01:48.026 --> 01:49.226
AGAIN.

01:49.226 --> 01:50.592
INSTEAD, LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:50.592 --> 01:51.793
EGYPT, HOME OF THE WORLD'S FIRST

01:51.793 --> 01:54.059
BOTCHED NOSE JOB.

01:54.059 --> 01:55.459
EGYPT HAD A PRESIDENTIAL

01:55.459 --> 01:57.059
ELECTION THIS WEEK, AND WHILE

01:57.059 --> 01:58.592
THE RESULTS WON'T BE OFFICIAL

01:58.592 --> 02:00.393
UNTIL TOMORROW, WE CAN NOW

02:00.393 --> 02:01.859
REVEAL THE WINNER WAS

02:01.859 --> 02:04.459
HILLARY CLINTON!

02:04.459 --> 02:06.826
>> ♪ THIS IS MY FIGHT SONG ♪

02:06.826 --> 02:08.093
>> John: NO.

02:08.093 --> 02:09.459
I'M KIDDING!

02:09.459 --> 02:10.260
I'M KIDDING!

02:10.260 --> 02:11.160
I'M KIDDING!

02:11.160 --> 02:15.026
SHE DIDN'T WIN.

02:15.026 --> 02:16.459
I JUST LOVE MESSING WITH YOU.

02:16.459 --> 02:17.226
THE EMAILS WERE REALLY A

02:17.226 --> 02:18.126
PROBLEM.

02:18.126 --> 02:19.126
NO, THE WINNER, OF COURSE, WILL

02:19.126 --> 02:19.926
BE EGPYT'S STRONGMAN

02:19.926 --> 02:20.993
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI, A MAN WHO

02:20.993 --> 02:21.893
ONCE FAMOUSLY UNROLLED A

02:21.893 --> 02:23.459
RED CARPET FOR HIMSELF THAT WAS

02:23.459 --> 02:24.193
LITERALLY MORE THAN TWO MILES

02:24.193 --> 02:31.126
LONG.

02:31.126 --> 02:31.726
AND THE REASON I KNOW HE'S THE

02:31.726 --> 02:32.360
WINNER IS THAT HE HAD NO SERIOUS

02:32.360 --> 02:32.926
OPPONENTS, POSSIBLY BECAUSE

02:32.926 --> 02:33.360
ONE WAS ARRESTED AND

02:33.360 --> 02:33.993
THREE MORE WITHDREW AMID REPORTS

02:33.993 --> 02:34.360
OF INTIMIDATION.

02:34.360 --> 02:34.959
AND YET EL-SISI CLAIMED TO BE

02:34.959 --> 02:40.293
DEVASTATED BY THE LACK OF

02:40.293 --> 02:40.626
COMPETITION.

02:40.626 --> 02:41.093
>> IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

02:41.093 --> 02:41.659
I SWEAR TO GOD, I WISH THERE

02:41.659 --> 02:42.692
WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CANDIDATES

02:42.692 --> 02:43.559
FOR PEOPLE TO CHOOSE WHO THEY

02:43.559 --> 02:45.226
WANT.

02:45.226 --> 02:46.459
BUT THEY WERE NOT READY YET.

02:46.459 --> 02:49.326
THERE IS NO SHAME IN THIS.

02:49.326 --> 02:50.592
>> John: OKAY, EL-SISI SAYING,

02:50.592 --> 02:52.426
"I WISH THERE HAD BEEN MORE

02:52.426 --> 02:53.592
CANDIDATES" IS BASICALLY A

02:53.592 --> 02:55.592
HIPPOPOTAMUS WHO JUST SAT ON A

02:55.592 --> 02:57.692
PILE OF HAMSTERS SAYING, "I

02:57.692 --> 02:59.293
SWEAR TO GOD, I WISH THERE WERE

02:59.293 --> 03:00.426
MORE HAMSTERS, BUT THEY WERE NOT

03:00.426 --> 03:01.726
READY TO CRAWL OUT FROM UNDER MY

03:01.726 --> 03:07.226
GIANT HIPPO BUTT.

03:07.226 --> 03:08.093
THERE IS NO SHAME IN THIS."

03:08.093 --> 03:08.859
BUT THE TRICKY THING IS, IF

03:08.859 --> 03:09.592
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING

03:09.592 --> 03:10.692
THAT EVEN LOOKS LIKE AN

03:10.692 --> 03:11.260
ELECTION, YOU BADLY NEED AT

03:11.260 --> 03:12.193
LEAST THE APPEARANCE OF AN

03:12.193 --> 03:14.360
OPPONENT.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.126
AND HE DID GET ONE OF THOSE,

03:15.126 --> 03:16.160
KIND OF.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.459
>> THE ONLY MAN TO STAND AGAINST

03:17.459 --> 03:18.592
PRESIDENT SISI IS

03:18.592 --> 03:20.293
MOUSA MOSTAFA MOUSA, AN OPENLY

03:20.293 --> 03:22.626
PRO-SISI POLITICIAN WHO, UNTIL

03:22.626 --> 03:24.759
THE DAY BEFORE HE REGISTERED TO

03:24.759 --> 03:26.893
RUN, WAS PART OF THE CAMPAIGN TO

03:26.893 --> 03:29.492
GET SISI REELECTED.

03:29.492 --> 03:31.260
>> John: IT'S TRUE, ONE OF HIS

03:31.260 --> 03:32.793
OWN SUPPORTERS JUMPED INTO THE

03:32.793 --> 03:35.592
RACE AT THE LAST MINUTE,

03:35.592 --> 03:37.059
SUBMITTING HIS CANDIDACY JUST

03:37.059 --> 03:38.126
15 MINUTES BEFORE THE DEADLINE.

03:38.126 --> 03:39.559
AND UNTIL THE MORNING OF HIS

03:39.559 --> 03:41.293
NOMINATION, MOUSA'S OWN FACEBOOK

03:41.293 --> 03:42.793
PAGE SAID "LONG LIVE EGYPT:

03:42.793 --> 03:43.993
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI FOR

03:43.993 --> 03:46.626
PRESIDENT."

03:46.626 --> 03:47.592
BUT LOOK, MAYBE THAT WAS JUST A

03:47.592 --> 03:48.626
GLITCH ON EGYPTIAN FACEBOOK.

03:48.626 --> 03:49.759
YOU KNOW, LIKE THE ONE ON

03:49.759 --> 03:50.759
AMERICA'S FACEBOOK WHERE THEY

03:50.759 --> 03:51.793
ALLOWED YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO BE

03:51.793 --> 03:52.759
ACCESSED BY A FIRM WORKING TO

03:52.759 --> 03:53.793
ELECT DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT OF

03:53.793 --> 03:56.993
THE UNITED STATES.

03:56.993 --> 03:58.126
BUT LOOK,, FARMVILLE WAS SUPER

03:58.126 --> 04:03.492
FUN, WASN'T IT?

04:03.492 --> 04:04.293
SO IT WAS ALL WORTH IT AT THE

04:04.293 --> 04:06.326
END OF THE DAY.

04:06.326 --> 04:07.326
BUT THE KEY RULE OF A SHAM

04:07.326 --> 04:08.226
ELECTION IS MAKE IT LOOK

04:08.226 --> 04:09.360
LEGITIMATE.

04:09.360 --> 04:09.993
SO EVEN ON ELECTION DAY,

04:09.993 --> 04:10.893
EL-SISI'S ELECTION SPOKESPERSON

04:10.893 --> 04:11.759
WAS REASSURING EGYPTIANS THAT

04:11.759 --> 04:12.993
THIS WAS A COMPLETELY FREE AND

04:12.993 --> 04:15.793
FAIR ELECTION.

04:15.793 --> 04:16.692
>> OF COURSE IT'S A ONE MILLION

04:16.692 --> 04:18.393
PERCENT DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND

04:18.393 --> 04:20.126
THE EVIDENCE IS THAT ALL THE

04:20.126 --> 04:21.993
EGYPTIAN PEOPLE, INCLUDING MANY

04:21.993 --> 04:23.326
BIG NUMBERS OF YOUTH AND

04:23.326 --> 04:26.226
ELDERLY, HAVE COME OUT TO VOTE.

04:26.226 --> 04:27.559
THEY ARE COMING TO SAY YES TO

04:27.559 --> 04:29.692
MR. PRESIDENT, YES TO EGYPT.

04:29.692 --> 04:33.393
WE ARE HERE TO SAY YES TO EGYPT.

04:33.393 --> 04:36.160
>> John: YEAH,

04:36.160 --> 04:36.526
THAT'S NICE.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.326
BUT SAYING "YES TO EGYPT" IS NOT

04:38.326 --> 04:39.659
WHAT THIS ELECTION'S SUPPOSED TO

04:39.659 --> 04:40.993
BE ABOUT.

04:40.993 --> 04:44.160
THE VOTE HERE IS NOT "IS EGYPT?"

04:44.160 --> 04:46.093
"YES OR NO?"

04:46.093 --> 04:47.426
UNSURPRISINGLY, EL-SISI IS

04:47.426 --> 04:48.360
PROJECTED TO WIN WITH 92% OF THE

04:48.360 --> 04:49.492
VOTE.

04:49.492 --> 04:50.559
BUT IN A SIGN OF WHAT A JOKE

04:50.559 --> 04:51.592
EGYPTIANS CONSIDERED THIS TO BE,

04:51.592 --> 04:52.726
THE TURNOUT WAS LOW, WITH ONLY

04:52.726 --> 04:54.260
AROUND 40% OF VOTERS BOTHERING

04:54.260 --> 04:55.059
TO SHOW UP, DESPITE THE FACT

04:55.059 --> 04:56.293
THAT, IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO

04:56.293 --> 04:57.592
MAKE IT LOOK LEGITIMATE, THE

04:57.592 --> 04:58.959
NATIONAL ELECTION AUTHORITY HAD

04:58.959 --> 05:00.160
THREATENED TO IMPOSE A FINE ON

05:00.160 --> 05:01.526
PEOPLE WHO FAILED TO CAST THEIR

05:01.526 --> 05:03.026
BALLOT.

05:03.026 --> 05:05.526
AND EL-SISI SUPPORTERS WEREN'T

05:05.526 --> 05:06.692
EVEN ABOVE LITERAL BRIBES TO GET

05:06.692 --> 05:08.526
EGYPTIANS TO GO TO THE POLLS.

05:08.526 --> 05:10.026
>> THE GOING RATE FOR A VOTE WAS

05:10.026 --> 05:11.626
AROUND $3 TO $5, BUT HEADING

05:11.626 --> 05:13.793
DOWN TO A POLLING STATION COULD

05:13.793 --> 05:16.459
ALSO HAVE LANDED YOU A BOX OF

05:16.459 --> 05:17.759
GROCERIES OR EVEN HALF-PRICE

05:17.759 --> 05:22.993
TICKETS TO AN AMUSEMENT PARK.

05:22.993 --> 05:25.893
>> John: WOW, FIVE BUCKS AND

05:25.893 --> 05:26.459
DISCOUNT TICKETS TO AN

05:26.459 --> 05:27.426
AMUSEMENT PARK.

05:27.426 --> 05:28.492
SAY WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT

05:28.492 --> 05:29.326
EL-SISI --

05:29.326 --> 05:30.160
AND IF YOU LIVE IN EGYPT,

05:30.160 --> 05:31.193
YOU CAN'T --

05:31.193 --> 05:32.126
BUT IT'S PRETTY DEPRESSING THAT,

05:32.126 --> 05:32.926
SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE

05:32.926 --> 05:33.893
ARAB SPRING, HE'S NOW TRYING TO

05:33.893 --> 05:34.793
WIN OVER VOTERS THE SAME WAY A

05:34.793 --> 05:36.026
DIVORCED DAD TRIES TO WIN OVER

05:36.026 --> 05:39.393
HIS KIDS.

05:39.393 --> 05:42.559
AND FINALLY TONIGHT, A QUICK

05:42.559 --> 05:44.126
UPDATE CONCERNING LOCAL NEWS --

05:44.126 --> 05:45.160
THE PEOPLE WHO BRING YOU STORIES

05:45.160 --> 05:46.059
LIKE THIS.

05:46.059 --> 05:47.193
>> GOOD EVENING,

05:47.193 --> 05:47.993
I'M KEN BASTIDA.

05:47.993 --> 05:49.459
DANA IS OFF TONIGHT.

05:49.459 --> 05:50.559
HE WAS MURDERED AND THEN SET ON

05:50.559 --> 05:51.759
FIRE WHILE CELEBRATING HIS

05:51.759 --> 05:59.293
BIRTHDAY.

05:59.293 --> 06:01.093
>> John: HOLY SHIT!

06:01.093 --> 06:02.426
EITHER HE NEEDED TO PUT A SPACE

06:02.426 --> 06:03.459
BETWEEN DANA'S WHEREABOUTS AND

06:03.459 --> 06:04.893
HIS FIRST STORY, OR SOMEONE WAS

06:04.893 --> 06:05.893
PRETTY PISSED OFF THEY WEREN'T

06:05.893 --> 06:07.426
INVITED TO DANA'S BIRTHDAY

06:07.426 --> 06:08.626
PARTY.

06:08.626 --> 06:09.759
LAST YEAR, WE TOLD YOU ABOUT

06:09.759 --> 06:10.826
SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, A

06:10.826 --> 06:11.893
COMPANY WHICH, IF THEIR

06:11.893 --> 06:13.026
ACQUISITION OF TRIBUNE MEDIA IS

06:13.026 --> 06:14.426
APPROVED, COULD SOON OWN LOCAL

06:14.426 --> 06:15.659
STATIONS REACHING 72% OF TV

06:15.659 --> 06:16.793
HOUSEHOLDS, AND IN THAT STORY,

06:16.793 --> 06:18.959
WE TALKED ABOUT SINCLAIR'S

06:18.959 --> 06:22.059
MUST-RUNS, STORIES STATION

06:22.059 --> 06:23.826
MANAGERS ARE FORCED TO INCLUDE

06:23.826 --> 06:25.293
IN THEIR BROADCASTS, WHICH OFTEN

06:25.293 --> 06:26.826
SKEW NOTICEABLY CONSERVATIVE.

06:26.826 --> 06:28.492
AND THOSE MUST-RUNS ARE STILL

06:28.492 --> 06:30.160
VERY MUCH HAPPENING, FEATURING

06:30.160 --> 06:32.126
EVERYTHING FROM AN INVESTIGATION

06:32.126 --> 06:34.226
INTO THE "DEEP STATE" THAT'S

06:34.226 --> 06:36.293
UNDERMINING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO

06:36.293 --> 06:37.426
REGULAR BATSHIT COMMENTARIES

06:37.426 --> 06:40.659
FROM FORMER TRUMP AIDE

06:40.659 --> 06:42.993
BORIS EPSHTEYN, WHO,

06:42.993 --> 06:45.226
INCIDENTALLY, IS 35 YEARS OLD.

06:45.226 --> 06:46.759
NOW, WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET

06:46.759 --> 06:47.826
INTO THAT.

06:47.826 --> 06:49.326
SUFFICE TO SAY, HE'S THE SAME

06:49.326 --> 06:49.959
AGE AS NICKI MINAJ WHILE SOMEHOW

06:49.959 --> 06:50.659
LOOKING LIKE JON FAVREAU'S

06:50.659 --> 06:54.659
FATHER.

06:54.659 --> 06:55.893
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, BUT THERE

06:55.893 --> 06:58.026
ISN'T TIME.

06:58.026 --> 06:58.993
THE POINT IS, BORIS CARRIES A

06:58.993 --> 06:59.993
LOT OF WATER FOR THIS PRESIDENT.

06:59.993 --> 07:00.993
REMEMBER WHEN TRUMP CALLED

07:00.993 --> 07:02.559
AFRICAN COUNTRIES SHITHOLES?

07:02.559 --> 07:03.659
WELL, THIS WAS BORIS'S HOT TAKE.

07:03.659 --> 07:05.360
>> MEDIA OUTLETS SUCH AS CNN ARE

07:05.360 --> 07:06.360
CURSING UP A STORM.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.592
NOT ONLY ARE THE ANCHORS ON THE

07:08.592 --> 07:09.559
NETWORKS CURSING LEFT AND RIGHT

07:09.559 --> 07:11.093
USING THE WORD, IT HAS BEEN

07:11.093 --> 07:12.626
WRITTEN IN BOLD LETTERS ACROSS

07:12.626 --> 07:13.659
THEIR SCREENS.

07:13.659 --> 07:14.926
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THE WORD

07:14.926 --> 07:16.759
ONCE IN A PRIVATE MEETING.

07:16.759 --> 07:18.160
HOW IS IT OKAY TO REPEAT IT AND

07:18.160 --> 07:19.326
SPLASH IT ON THE SCREEN HUNDREDS

07:19.326 --> 07:20.926
OF TIMES?

07:20.926 --> 07:26.926
I BELIEVE THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

07:26.926 --> 07:28.059
>> John: OKAY, HOLD, ON.

07:28.059 --> 07:29.326
FIRST OF ALL,

07:29.326 --> 07:30.360
WHAT THE FUCK WAS UP WITH THAT

07:30.360 --> 07:31.959
ZOOM?

07:31.959 --> 07:33.293
HE'S LIKE THE DRAMATIC CHIPMUNK

07:33.293 --> 07:37.626
OF DISINGENUOUS BULLSHIT.

07:37.626 --> 07:40.793
BUT SECOND, PEOPLE WERE NOT

07:40.793 --> 07:42.959
UPSET THAT TRUMP USED A BAD

07:42.959 --> 07:45.093
WORD, THEY WERE UPSET HE USED

07:45.093 --> 07:46.093
HIS RACIST BRAIN AND MOUTH.

07:46.093 --> 07:46.893
IF TRUMP HAD CALLED HAITI,

07:46.893 --> 07:47.893
EL SALVADOR, AND AFRICA

07:47.893 --> 07:48.759
"FUCKING DOPE-ASS PLACES FROM

07:51.526 --> 07:52.592
ANYONE WOULD HAVE BEEN OFFENDED

07:52.592 --> 07:53.692
BY HIS VULGARITY.

BUT RECENTLY, SINCLAIR TOOK

07:55.193 --> 07:57.326
THEIR GAME TO A NEW LEVEL.

07:57.326 --> 07:59.226
'CAUSE A FEW WEEKS BACK, A

07:59.226 --> 08:00.126
SCRIPT LEAKED FOR A STATEMENT

08:00.126 --> 08:04.026
THEY WANTED LOCAL ANCHORS TO

08:04.026 --> 08:05.492
DELIVER, WARNING THAT NATIONAL

08:05.492 --> 08:06.260
MEDIA OUTLETS WERE PUBLISHING

08:06.260 --> 08:06.993
FAKE STORIES, ECHOING ONE OF

08:06.993 --> 08:08.226
TRUMP'S FAVORITE TALKING POINTS

08:08.226 --> 08:09.659
OR, MORE COMMONLY,

08:09.659 --> 08:10.360
SCREAMING POINTS.

08:10.360 --> 08:11.193
HERE'S A TASTE.

08:11.193 --> 08:12.426
>> WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

08:12.426 --> 08:13.426
TROUBLING TREND OF

08:13.426 --> 08:14.526
IRRESPONSIBLE, ONE-SIDED NEWS

08:14.526 --> 08:15.692
STORIES PLAGUING OUR COUNTRY.

08:15.692 --> 08:17.026
>> UNFORTUNATELY, SOME MEMBERS

08:17.026 --> 08:18.459
OF THE MEDIA USE THEIR PLATFORMS

08:18.459 --> 08:19.559
TO PUSH THEIR OWN PERSONAL BIAS

08:19.559 --> 08:20.893
AND AGENDA TO CONTROL EXACTLY

08:20.893 --> 08:22.093
WHAT PEOPLE THINK.

08:22.093 --> 08:23.393
THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO

08:23.393 --> 08:24.893
OUR DEMOCRACY.

08:24.893 --> 08:26.026
>> John: YEAH, IT CAN BE

08:26.026 --> 08:26.993
DANGEROUS WHEN MEMBERS OF THE

08:26.993 --> 08:28.160
MEDIA USE THEIR PLATFORMS TO

08:28.160 --> 08:29.260
PUSH THEIR OWN PERSONAL BIAS AND

08:29.260 --> 08:30.426
AGENDA, LIKE WHEN BORIS TRIES TO

08:30.426 --> 08:32.326
CONVINCE YOU THAT TRUMP IS A

08:32.326 --> 08:34.692
GOOD PRESIDENT, OR WHEN I TRY TO

08:34.692 --> 08:35.726
CONVINCE YOU THAT THE ONLY WAY

08:35.726 --> 08:36.959
BORIS EPSHTEYN WAS BORN 35 YEARS

08:36.959 --> 08:38.126
AGO IS IF HE CAME OUT OF THE

08:38.126 --> 08:43.459
WOMB AT AGE 23.

08:43.459 --> 08:44.426
THERE ISN'T TIME.

08:44.426 --> 08:45.459
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, BUT THERE

08:45.459 --> 08:47.326
ISN'T TIME.

08:47.326 --> 08:48.559
NOW, SOME SINCLAIR ANCHORS

08:48.559 --> 08:49.559
COMPLAINED TO THE PRESS, SAYING,

08:49.559 --> 08:50.393
"THIS IS SO MANIPULATIVE," AND

08:50.393 --> 08:51.226
"I FELT LIKE A PRISONER OF WAR

08:51.226 --> 08:52.926
RECORDING A MESSAGE."

08:52.926 --> 08:56.759
AND I WILL SAY, I DON'T KNOW

08:56.759 --> 08:58.826
THAT WOMAN FROM BEFORE, BUT JUST

08:58.826 --> 09:01.393
LOOK AT HER EYES WHEN HER

09:01.393 --> 09:02.426
COANCHOR IS TALKING.

09:02.426 --> 09:03.126
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE'D RATHER BE

09:03.126 --> 09:03.893
MURDERED AND SET ON FIRE WHILE

09:03.893 --> 09:04.659
CELEBRATING HER BIRTHDAY.

09:04.659 --> 09:05.526
NOW, THAT STATEMENT IS CREEPY

09:05.526 --> 09:06.426
ENOUGH.

09:06.426 --> 09:07.126
BUT WHEN YOU SEE JUST HOW MANY

09:07.126 --> 09:08.193
LOCAL STATIONS WERE FORCED TO

09:08.193 --> 09:11.059
READ IT AND WATCH THEM TOGETHER,

09:11.059 --> 09:13.859
AS MANY HAVE BEEN DOING ONLINE

09:13.859 --> 09:14.559
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS,

09:14.559 --> 09:15.293
YOU BEGIN TO REALIZE THE TRUE

09:15.293 --> 09:15.893
EFFECT OF SINCLAIR'S REACH AND

POWER.

09:41.293 --> 09:41.993
THE SAME MESSAGE OVER AND OVER

YOU KNOW, THE PLACE WHERE

MILLIONS OF AMERICANS END UP

11:02.426 --> 11:03.193
EVERY YEAR AFTER MAKING A LARGE

SQUIRREL SHIT-TALK THE CEO OF A

COAL COMPANY.

11:05.426 --> 11:06.360
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.226
COURTS AREN'T JUST THE CENTER OF

11:07.226 --> 11:08.160
OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM, THEY'RE THE

11:08.160 --> 11:16.360
BACKBONE OF DAYTIME TV.

11:16.360 --> 11:16.993
>> Announcer: A COLLEGE STUDENT

11:37.492 --> 11:38.526

11:40.826 --> 11:43.592
>> Announcer: "HOT BENCH."

11:43.592 --> 11:47.926
>> John: NOW, I KNOW THAT LOOKS

11:47.926 --> 11:49.926
LIKE A FUN EPISODE OF

11:49.926 --> 11:52.026
"HOT BENCH", BUT YOU SHOULD

11:52.026 --> 11:53.826
KNOW, THAT CUTE DOG ACTUALLY

11:53.826 --> 11:56.126
CONFESSED TO MURDERING 14 PEOPLE

11:56.126 --> 11:56.659
IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST.

11:56.659 --> 11:57.959
SO IT'S NOT AS FUN AS THEY JUST

11:57.959 --> 11:58.793
MADE IT LOOK.

11:58.793 --> 11:59.360
BUT TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO

11:59.360 --> 11:59.959
FOCUS ON A TYPE OF JUSTICE YOU

11:59.959 --> 12:01.093
DON'T GET TO WATCH ON TV, AND IT

12:01.093 --> 12:01.659
CONCERNS IMMIGRATION COURTS.

12:01.659 --> 12:02.293
THEY'RE ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU

12:02.293 --> 12:02.926
MAY NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT, BUT ARE

12:02.926 --> 12:03.526
ACTUALLY HUGELY IMPORTANT TO A

12:03.526 --> 12:04.426
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE,

12:04.426 --> 12:05.260
LIKE GEFILTE FISH OR

12:05.260 --> 12:06.559
THE INSANE CLOWN POSSE.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.193
IN RECENT MONTHS, YOU MAY HAVE

12:08.193 --> 12:09.026
SEEN MULTIPLE STORIES OF I.C.E.

12:09.026 --> 12:10.226
AGENTS RAIDING WORKPLACES AND

12:10.226 --> 12:11.826
HAULING PEOPLE AWAY.

12:11.826 --> 12:13.093
AND WHILE THOSE STORIES ARE

12:13.093 --> 12:15.160
HORRIFYING AND GRAB ALL THE

12:15.160 --> 12:16.260
ATTENTION, THE PLACE MANY OF

12:16.260 --> 12:17.160
THOSE PEOPLE END UP,

12:17.160 --> 12:18.492
IMMIGRATION COURTS, ARE NO LESS

12:18.492 --> 12:20.093
TROUBLING.

12:20.093 --> 12:21.393
THERE ARE AROUND 60 OF THEM ALL

12:21.393 --> 12:23.293
OVER THE COUNTRY, AND HUNDREDS

12:23.293 --> 12:24.393
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE GO

12:24.393 --> 12:26.260
THROUGH THEM EVERY YEAR,

12:26.260 --> 12:26.893
PLEADING THEIR CASE AGAINST

12:26.893 --> 12:28.959
DEPORTATION.

12:28.959 --> 12:30.160
SO THEY'RE HUGELY CONSEQUENTIAL,

12:30.160 --> 12:31.492
AND THE STAKES IN THESE CASES

12:31.492 --> 12:33.293
CAN BE INCREDIBLY HIGH, AS ONE

12:33.293 --> 12:34.393
GIRL AWAITING A HEARING CAN

12:34.393 --> 12:35.459
ATTEST.

12:35.459 --> 12:36.260
>> WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE SENT

12:36.260 --> 12:39.160
YOU HOME?

12:39.160 --> 12:40.193
>> THEY GONNA KILL ME.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.326
THEY GONNA KILL ME AND THEY

12:41.326 --> 12:46.393
GONNA KILL MY FAMILY.

12:46.393 --> 12:47.326
>> John: THAT'S HORRIBLE.

12:47.326 --> 12:48.226
NO CHILD SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY

12:48.226 --> 12:49.059
ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO

12:49.059 --> 12:50.059
BE MURDERED.

12:50.059 --> 12:50.726
THE BIGGEST THING THEY SHOULD BE

12:50.726 --> 12:51.492
WORRYING ABOUT IS WHETHER THEY

12:51.492 --> 12:54.559
CAN SIT WITH THE COOL KIDS WHILE

12:54.559 --> 12:55.360
THEY EAT THEIR TIDE PODS AND HOW

12:55.360 --> 12:56.360
THEY CAN PLEASE SLENDER MAN.

12:56.360 --> 12:59.226
AND THAT LAST ONE IS OBVIOUSLY

12:59.226 --> 13:00.226
RIDICULOUS, 'CAUSE REMEMBER,

13:00.226 --> 13:01.293
KIDS, SLENDER MAN ALREADY LOVES

13:01.293 --> 13:03.326
YOU JUST THE WAY YOU ARE.

13:03.326 --> 13:04.260
SO THIS IS A CRITICAL,

13:04.260 --> 13:05.260
POTENTIALLY LIFE-AND-DEATH

13:05.260 --> 13:06.692
PROCESS.

13:06.692 --> 13:07.893
SADLY, THE SYSTEM IS A COMPLETE

13:07.893 --> 13:08.826
MESS.

13:08.826 --> 13:10.126
AND DON'T TAKE THAT FROM ME --

13:10.126 --> 13:11.160
TAKE THAT FROM MULTIPLE CURRENT

13:11.160 --> 13:12.059
AND FORMER IMMIGRATION COURT

13:12.059 --> 13:13.659
JUDGES.

13:13.659 --> 13:15.692
>> I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE

13:15.692 --> 13:18.226
INCREDULOUS AT WHAT REALLY

13:18.226 --> 13:20.093
HAPPENS IN IMMIGRATION COURT AND

13:20.093 --> 13:21.926
WHAT SOMETIMES PASSES FOR

13:21.926 --> 13:22.360
DUE PROCESS.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.293
>> OUR COURTS TODAY ARE

13:23.293 --> 13:24.226
DYSFUNCTIONAL.

13:24.226 --> 13:25.160
>> IN ESSENCE, WE'RE DOING

13:25.160 --> 13:26.360
DEATH PENALTY CASES IN A

13:26.360 --> 13:27.592
TRAFFIC COURT SETTING.

13:27.592 --> 13:28.893
>> John: "DEATH PENALTY CASES IN

13:28.893 --> 13:32.692
TRAFFIC COURT".

13:32.692 --> 13:34.592
THAT IS SOMETHING WE PROBABLY

13:34.592 --> 13:35.260
SHOULDN'T BE DOING, IN A PLACE

13:35.260 --> 13:36.360
WE DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T BE DOING

13:36.360 --> 13:37.226
IT.

13:37.226 --> 13:38.160
LIKE HAVING A COCKFIGHT IN AN

13:38.160 --> 13:38.893
EMERGENCY ROOM OR DOING COKE IN

13:38.893 --> 13:42.893
A BUILD-A-BEAR WORKSHOP.

13:42.893 --> 13:45.459
IT'S A CRAZY IDEA.

13:45.459 --> 13:46.026
IT GETS STUCK IN THE BEAR'S

13:46.026 --> 13:46.959
HAIR.

13:46.959 --> 13:47.959
IT'S COMPLETELY INEFFICIENT.

13:47.959 --> 13:48.859
SO HOW DID THIS SYSTEM GET SO

13:48.859 --> 13:49.859
BROKEN?

13:49.859 --> 13:50.859
WELL, LET'S START WITH THE FACT

13:50.859 --> 13:51.959
THAT A SURGE IN IMMIGRATION FROM

13:51.959 --> 13:53.126
CENTRAL AMERICA, RAMPED-UP

13:53.126 --> 13:54.326
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT, AND A

13:54.326 --> 13:55.726
GLACIAL RATE OF HIRING JUDGES

13:55.726 --> 13:57.193
HAVE COMBINED TO CREATE A TRULY

13:57.193 --> 14:00.193
MASSIVE BACKLOG OF CASES.

14:00.193 --> 14:01.492
>> MORE THAN 617,000 IMMIGRATION

14:01.492 --> 14:03.659
CASES ARE NOW BACKLOGGED.

14:03.659 --> 14:04.826
THAT NUMBER HAS MORE THAN

14:04.826 --> 14:09.526
DOUBLED SINCE 2009.

14:09.526 --> 14:10.726
"IT'S AS IF THEY HAVE

14:10.726 --> 14:11.759
FORGOTTEN US," SAYS ANDRES, ONE

14:11.759 --> 14:12.726
OF THE GUATEMALAN IMMIGRANTS

14:12.726 --> 14:13.859
WAITING FOR HIS HEARING IN

14:13.859 --> 14:14.793
SAN FRANCISCO, WHERE THE AVERAGE

14:14.793 --> 14:15.926
WAIT TIME IS THREE YEARS.

14:15.926 --> 14:17.559
IN MIAMI, THE WAIT IS ABOUT A

14:17.559 --> 14:18.160
YEAR AND A HALF, AND IT'S MUCH

14:18.160 --> 14:18.759
WORSE IN CITIES LIKE

14:18.759 --> 14:19.326
SAN ANTONIO, ATLANTA, AND

14:19.326 --> 14:22.993
CHICAGO.

14:22.993 --> 14:25.826
>> John: IT'S TRUE, THE

14:25.826 --> 14:26.559
ESTIMATED WAIT TIME IN CHICAGO

14:26.559 --> 14:27.326
IS FIVE YEARS.

14:27.326 --> 14:27.926
AND IF YOU'RE STUCK IN THAT

14:27.926 --> 14:29.126
LINE, THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOUR

14:29.126 --> 14:30.226
CASE, BECAUSE EVIDENCE FOR YOUR

14:30.226 --> 14:31.193
CLAIM CAN BECOME STALE, AND

14:31.193 --> 14:32.160
WITNESSES WHO COULD HELP YOU CAN

14:32.160 --> 14:34.426
DISAPPEAR OR DIE.

14:34.426 --> 14:36.759
AND YET OVER 600,000 CASES HAVE

14:36.759 --> 14:39.426
PILED UP ENDLESSLY, LIKE

14:39.426 --> 14:40.893
BED BATH AND BEYOND COUPONS,

14:40.893 --> 14:42.026
"NEW YORKER" MAGAZINES, AND

14:42.026 --> 14:43.492
DVR'ED EPISODES OF

14:43.492 --> 14:48.592
KEN BURNS' VIETNAM DOCUMENTARY.

14:48.592 --> 14:50.692
YEAH, I KNOW IT'S GOOD, BUT I'M

14:50.692 --> 14:54.226
JUST NEVER IN THE MOOD.

14:54.226 --> 15:01.160
AND I NEVER, EVER WILL BE.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.393
NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER.

15:02.393 --> 15:03.326
BUT THE ISSUES GO MUCH DEEPER

15:03.326 --> 15:04.293
THAN LONG WAIT TIMES.

15:04.293 --> 15:05.893
BECAUSE WHILE IMMIGRATION COURTS

15:05.893 --> 15:06.759
HAVE THE TRAPPINGS OF A CRIMINAL

15:06.759 --> 15:07.692
COURT -- YOU CAN WIND UP THERE

15:07.692 --> 15:09.059
FROM AN ARREST, YOU CAN BE

15:09.059 --> 15:09.692
DETAINED AWAITING YOUR HEARING,

15:09.692 --> 15:10.893
AND YOU'RE ARGUING AGAINST THE

15:10.893 --> 15:11.492
GOVERNMENT -- THEY'RE ACTUALLY

15:11.492 --> 15:12.026
CIVIL COURTS.

15:12.026 --> 15:12.959
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL

15:12.959 --> 15:13.759
TRIAL.

15:13.759 --> 15:14.759
THEIR ONLY TASK IS DECIDING

15:14.759 --> 15:15.692
WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN STAY IN

15:15.692 --> 15:16.592
THE COUNTRY.

15:16.592 --> 15:17.659
THAT'S IT.

15:17.659 --> 15:18.826
SO A LOT OF THINGS YOU MIGHT

15:18.826 --> 15:19.926
ASSUME SOMEONE IN THESE COURTS

15:19.926 --> 15:20.893
WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO, THEY

15:20.893 --> 15:23.492
DON'T.

15:23.492 --> 15:25.260
AND THE FIRST BIG ONE IS THIS.

15:25.260 --> 15:26.893
>> UNLIKE CRIMINAL COURT, IN

15:26.893 --> 15:28.293
IMMIGRATION COURT, THE FEDERAL

15:28.293 --> 15:29.692
GOVERNMENT IS NOT REQUIRED TO

15:29.692 --> 15:30.859
PROVIDE LAWYERS TO DEFENDANTS

15:30.859 --> 15:36.726
WHO CANNOT AFFORD THEM.

15:36.726 --> 15:38.559
>> John: EXACTLY.

15:38.559 --> 15:40.492
IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD A LAWYER,

15:40.492 --> 15:42.959
YOU HAVE TO DEFEND YOURSELF,

15:42.959 --> 15:44.026
WHICH IS CLEARLY A TERRIBLE

15:44.026 --> 15:44.926
IDEA.

15:44.926 --> 15:45.692
THINK OF AN IMMIGRATION HEARING

15:45.692 --> 15:46.526
LIKE SURGERY.

15:46.526 --> 15:47.260
YOU CAN TRY AND DO IT YOURSELF,

15:47.260 --> 15:49.326
BUT IF YOU EVER WANT TO SEE YOUR

15:49.326 --> 15:53.893
FUCKING FAMILY AGAIN, MAYBE GET

15:53.893 --> 15:56.993
A PROFESSIONAL TO HELP YOU.

15:56.993 --> 15:58.193
AND TROUBLINGLY, ONLY 37% OF

15:58.193 --> 15:59.126
IMMIGRANTS IN THESE COURTS HAVE

15:59.126 --> 15:59.893
COUNSEL, MEANING THE MAJORITY OF

15:59.893 --> 16:00.759
THEM ARE APPEARING IN FRONT OF

16:00.759 --> 16:01.592
THE JUDGE WITHOUT A LAWYER.

16:01.592 --> 16:02.393
AND SOME IN PARTICULAR REALLY

16:02.393 --> 16:03.360
NEED ONE.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.293
>> MANY OF THE UNDOCUMENTED

16:04.293 --> 16:05.193
CHILDREN THAT WALK INTO THE

16:05.193 --> 16:06.260
IMMIGRATION COURTHOUSE DON'T

16:06.260 --> 16:07.326
HAVE AN ATTORNEY AND MUST

16:07.326 --> 16:09.759
REPRESENT THEMSELVES.

16:09.759 --> 16:11.326
>> THERE'S CHILDREN FROM

16:11.326 --> 16:12.626
2 YEARS OLD TO 17 YEARS OLD WHO

16:12.626 --> 16:14.026
ARE APPEARING BY THEMSELVES, WHO

16:14.026 --> 16:15.926
ARE SITTING THERE WITHOUT A CLUE

16:15.926 --> 16:20.160
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.

16:20.160 --> 16:20.793
>> John: THAT'S JUST CLEARLY

16:20.793 --> 16:22.726
RIDICULOUS.

16:22.726 --> 16:26.026
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LET A

16:26.026 --> 16:26.626
2-YEAR-OLD BE UNSUPERVISED IN

16:26.626 --> 16:27.193
COURT.

16:27.193 --> 16:28.026
YOU CAN'T EVEN LET A 2-YEAR-OLD

16:28.026 --> 16:28.893
BE UNSUPERVISED IN A

16:28.893 --> 16:29.759
BOUNCY CASTLE.

16:29.759 --> 16:31.059
THEY'RE GOING TO COME OUT

16:31.059 --> 16:32.026
COVERED IN GLITTER, HOLDING A

16:32.026 --> 16:33.193
BROKEN BEER BOTTLE AND A DEAD

16:33.193 --> 16:33.592
BIRD.

16:33.592 --> 16:34.526
HOW DID THEY GET THEM?

16:34.526 --> 16:35.193
WHO KNOWS?

16:35.193 --> 16:36.726
THE POINT IS, THEY CAN'T BE

16:36.726 --> 16:37.826
LEFT ALONE FOR A SECOND.

16:37.826 --> 16:39.126
AND THAT BIRD HAS ALREADY BEEN

16:39.126 --> 16:42.026
IN THEIR MOUTH.

16:42.026 --> 16:42.726
IT JUST HAS.

16:42.726 --> 16:44.626
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT

16:44.626 --> 16:44.859
REALITY.

16:44.859 --> 16:45.826
AND WHILE SENDING KIDS INTO

16:45.826 --> 16:46.826
COURT WITHOUT REPRESENTATION

16:46.826 --> 16:48.026
MIGHT SEEM CRAZY TO YOU,

16:48.026 --> 16:49.160
AMAZINGLY, SOME JUDGES ARE

16:49.160 --> 16:50.059
APPARENTLY FINE WITH IT, BECAUSE

16:50.059 --> 16:51.426
WHEN A LAWSUIT WAS FILED ARGUING

16:51.426 --> 16:52.959
ALL KIDS NEED LAWYERS,

16:52.959 --> 16:54.492
JACK WEIL, AN ASSISTANT CHIEF

16:54.492 --> 16:55.659
IMMIGRATION JUDGE, SUGGESTED

16:55.659 --> 17:02.360
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.260
>> I'VE TAUGHT IMMIGRATION LAW

17:03.260 --> 17:04.126
LITERALLY TO 3-YEAR-OLDS AND

17:04.126 --> 17:05.193
4-YEAR-OLDS.

17:05.193 --> 17:06.360
IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME.

17:06.360 --> 17:08.926
IT TAKES A LOT OF PATIENCE.

17:08.926 --> 17:10.893
THEY GET IT.

17:10.893 --> 17:12.592
IT'S NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT, BUT

17:12.592 --> 17:14.926
IT CAN BE DONE.

17:14.926 --> 17:16.959
>> John: NO, IT CAN'T.

17:16.959 --> 17:18.526
YOU CAN'T TEACH IMMIGRATION LAW

17:18.526 --> 17:20.026
TO A 3-YEAR-OLD.

17:20.026 --> 17:21.126
YOU CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN TO A

17:21.126 --> 17:22.959
CHILD THAT AGE THAT ELMO ISN'T

17:22.959 --> 17:26.260
HIS BEST FRIEND.

17:26.260 --> 17:27.993
ELMO'S NOT ONLY A PUPPET,

17:27.993 --> 17:29.026
HE'S A CELEBRITY.

17:29.026 --> 17:30.126
HE'S NEVER EVEN HEARD OF YOU.

17:30.126 --> 17:31.293
YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS COMPLETELY

17:31.293 --> 17:33.160
ASYMMETRICAL.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.659
ONE IMMIGRATION LAWYER ACTUALLY

17:36.659 --> 17:38.659
PUT JUDGE WEIL'S 3-YEAR-OLDS

17:38.659 --> 17:40.859
THEORY TO THE TEST IN WHAT IS

17:40.859 --> 17:42.126
PERHAPS THE SINGLE GREATEST

17:42.126 --> 17:43.193
MOCK TRIAL EVER RECORDED.

17:43.193 --> 17:44.193
>> AND DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH AS

17:44.193 --> 17:45.293
YOUR NATIVE LANGUAGE?

17:45.293 --> 17:46.959
>> YEAH.

17:46.959 --> 17:48.859
I LIKE MY BALLOON.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.393
>> I LIKE YOUR BALLOON TOO.

17:50.393 --> 17:54.059
WHAT IS YOUR BEST LANGUAGE?

17:54.059 --> 17:56.959
>> I PLACED A TIE OVER FAIRIES

17:56.959 --> 17:58.592
TO  AND

17:58.592 --> 17:59.726
BLUE.

17:59.726 --> 18:02.426
>> WHERE WERE YOU BORN?

18:02.426 --> 18:05.193
>> I...

18:05.193 --> 18:07.293
I...

18:07.293 --> 18:08.093
I...

18:08.093 --> 18:09.526
I...

18:09.526 --> 18:10.193
I...

18:10.193 --> 18:11.026
I...

18:11.026 --> 18:11.859
I...

18:11.859 --> 18:13.093
IT WAS MOMMY AND .

18:13.093 --> 18:14.093
>> SO DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU COULD

18:14.093 --> 18:15.360
GO AHEAD AND REPRESENT YOURSELF

18:15.360 --> 18:15.859
IN IMMIGRATION COURT TO

18:15.859 --> 18:16.459
DETERMINE YOUR NATIONALITY?

18:16.459 --> 18:17.893
>> UH-HUH!

18:17.893 --> 18:18.592
>> ALL RIGHT.

18:18.592 --> 18:19.393
ARE YOU EXCITED TO DO IT?

18:19.393 --> 18:20.260
>> YEAH!

18:20.260 --> 18:21.393
>> John: YEAH!

18:21.393 --> 18:22.260
YEAH!

18:22.260 --> 18:23.160
OF COURSE SHE'S EXCITED!

18:23.160 --> 18:24.026
SHE KNOWS ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT

18:24.026 --> 18:24.993
LEGAL PRINCIPLES:

18:24.993 --> 18:25.893
"IF I LIKE MY BALLOON, YOU

18:25.893 --> 18:26.893
MUSTN'T DEPORT SOON," AND

18:26.893 --> 18:27.759
"IF I PLACE A TIE OVER FAIRIES

18:27.759 --> 18:28.592
TO...

18:30.692 --> 18:31.526
AND...

18:33.626 --> 18:35.326
ASYLUM."

18:35.326 --> 18:37.059
THAT LAWYER ACTUALLY DID A

18:37.059 --> 18:37.959
SERIES OF VIDEOS WITH KIDS, AND

18:37.959 --> 18:38.759
THEY'RE ALL GREAT, BUT MY

18:38.759 --> 18:40.360
FAVORITE IS THIS ONE.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.160
>> IF YOU WERE REMOVED, WOULD

18:42.160 --> 18:42.993
YOU LIKE TO DESIGNATE A COUNTRY

18:42.993 --> 18:43.926
OF REMOVAL?

18:43.926 --> 18:45.026
>> YEAH.

18:45.026 --> 18:46.893
>> OKAY, WHAT COUNTRY WOULD THAT

18:46.893 --> 18:53.559
BE?

18:53.559 --> 18:57.360
>> UM...

18:57.360 --> 19:00.026
PIZZA.

19:00.026 --> 19:01.426
>> John: YEAH, YOU LAUGH NOW,

19:01.426 --> 19:02.459
BUT IT WON'T BE SO CUTE WHEN

19:02.459 --> 19:03.559
THAT GIRL IS DEPORTED BACK TO

19:03.559 --> 19:06.559
PAPA JOHN'S.

19:06.559 --> 19:08.492
BECAUSE IT'S TECHNICALLY PIZZA,

19:08.492 --> 19:10.093
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY THESE

19:10.093 --> 19:11.692
CHILDREN NEED LAWYERS.

19:11.692 --> 19:12.592
BUT THE TRUTH IS, WHETHER YOU

19:12.592 --> 19:13.959
HAVE A LAWYER OR NOT, YOUR ODDS

19:13.959 --> 19:16.459
OF SUCCESS, TO A FRIGHTENING

19:16.459 --> 19:17.826
DEGREE, MAY BE DICTATED BY

19:17.826 --> 19:18.592
WHERE YOU ARE.

19:18.592 --> 19:19.626
>> IN SAN FRANCISCO, IMMIGRANTS

19:19.626 --> 19:21.993
ARE DEPORTED IN 36% OF CASES.

19:21.993 --> 19:23.126
IN CHARLOTTE, THE NUMBER JUMPS

19:23.126 --> 19:25.293
TO 84%.

19:25.293 --> 19:26.526
IN NEW YORK CITY, ONLY 24% OF

19:26.526 --> 19:29.926
CASES RESULT IN DEPORTATION.

19:29.926 --> 19:31.226
IN ATLANTA, THE RATE IS ALMOST

19:31.226 --> 19:34.759
90%.

19:34.759 --> 19:36.193
>> John: AND LOOK, WHILE THE

19:36.193 --> 19:40.893
MERITS OF EVERY CASE ARE

19:40.893 --> 19:42.059
DIFFERENT, THAT ISAN ALARMING

19:42.059 --> 19:43.026
DISPARITY BETWEEN COURTS.

19:43.026 --> 19:43.592
NORMALLY THE ONLY THING THAT

19:43.592 --> 19:44.226
SHOULD VARY THAT MUCH BY REGION

19:44.226 --> 19:44.859
IS THE RATE OF JEFF DUNHAM FANS

19:44.859 --> 19:48.726
PER CAPITA.

19:48.726 --> 19:49.426
AND REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU ARE,

19:49.426 --> 19:50.326
IN EITHER CASE, THAT NUMBER

19:50.326 --> 19:51.926
SHOULD NEVER BE AS HIGH AS 90%.

19:51.926 --> 19:52.926
AND THE FINAL QUIRK OF THIS

19:52.926 --> 19:53.793
SYSTEM IS THAT IMMIGRATION

19:53.793 --> 19:54.793
COURTS ARE NOT NEARLY AS

19:54.793 --> 19:56.692
INDEPENDENT AS THEY SHOULD BE.

19:56.692 --> 19:59.160
BECAUSE WHILE YOU MIGHT ASSUME

19:59.160 --> 20:00.360
THAT THEY'D BE PART OF THE

20:00.360 --> 20:01.126
JUDICIAL BRANCH, IMMIGRATION

20:01.126 --> 20:02.193
COURTS ARE ACTUALLY PART OF THE

20:02.193 --> 20:04.393
EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

20:04.393 --> 20:05.559
SPECIFICALLY, THEY'RE RUN BY THE

20:05.559 --> 20:06.993
DOJ, MAKING THEM SUBJECT TO

20:06.993 --> 20:08.959
SHIFTING POLITICAL PRIORITIES.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.826
SO FOR INSTANCE, RIGHT NOW, THE

20:10.826 --> 20:12.893
BOSS OF ALL THESE JUDGES IS

20:12.893 --> 20:15.026
THIS MAN, JEFF SESSIONS, THE

20:15.026 --> 20:16.492
ONLY CABINET MEMBER ALLOWED TO

20:16.492 --> 20:17.526
FLY AS A LAP INFANT ON A

20:17.526 --> 20:20.093
DOMESTIC FLIGHT.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.526
AND HE'S MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR

20:21.526 --> 20:23.893
WHAT HIS PRIORITIES ARE.

20:23.893 --> 20:25.893
>> FOR THOSE THAT CONTINUE TO

20:25.893 --> 20:27.793
SEEK IMPROPER AND ILLEGAL ENTRY

20:27.793 --> 20:29.193
INTO THIS COUNTRY, BE

20:29.193 --> 20:30.692
FOREWARNED.

20:30.692 --> 20:33.559
THIS IS A NEW ERA.

20:33.559 --> 20:37.592
THIS IS THE TRUMP ERA.

20:37.592 --> 20:39.859
>> John: YOU KNOW, IT'S A VERY

20:39.859 --> 20:41.959
SPECIFIC TYPE OF PERSON WHO

20:41.959 --> 20:42.859
GRINS WHEN SAYING THE WORDS

20:42.859 --> 20:43.726
"THE TRUMP ERA."

20:43.726 --> 20:45.026
IT'S BASICALLY PEOPLE WITH

20:45.026 --> 20:45.559
TRUMP'S NAME, PEOPLE WITH

20:45.559 --> 20:46.626
TRUMP'S HATS, AND THE ONE PERSON

20:46.626 --> 20:47.260
IN AMERICA STILL GETTING A KICK

20:47.260 --> 20:50.360
OUT OF "COVFEFE."

20:50.360 --> 20:56.426
"HEY, I DON'T AGREE WITH

20:56.426 --> 20:58.859
EVERYTHING THE GUY SAYS, BUT

20:58.859 --> 21:01.226
BOY, HAVE WE HAD SOME LAUGHS.

21:01.226 --> 21:05.360
'CAUSE IT'S NOT A WORD.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.059
THAT'S WHY IT'S FUNNY.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.026
IT'S PRICELESS."

21:10.026 --> 21:11.126
AND SESSIONS HAS A WEIRD AMOUNT

21:11.126 --> 21:11.926
OF POWER OVER IMMIGRATION

21:11.926 --> 21:12.659
COURTS.

21:12.659 --> 21:13.326
HE CAN REFER CASES TO HIMSELF,

21:13.326 --> 21:14.059
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS STEPPING

21:14.059 --> 21:14.726
IN AND PERSONALLY REVIEWING

21:14.726 --> 21:15.393
DECISIONS.

21:15.393 --> 21:16.093
HE ACTUALLY PICKED UP A CASE

21:16.093 --> 21:16.993
RECENTLY CONCERNING A WOMAN

21:16.993 --> 21:17.993
DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR ASYLUM OVER

21:17.993 --> 21:19.826
A YEAR AGO BASED ON DOMESTIC

21:19.826 --> 21:21.726
VIOLENCE THAT SHE SUFFERED FOR

21:21.726 --> 21:23.293
YEARS UNDER HER EX-HUSBAND IN

21:23.293 --> 21:24.893
EL SALVADOR.

21:24.893 --> 21:25.726
NOW, IF HE OVERTURNS THAT

21:25.726 --> 21:26.393
DECISION, NOT ONLY COULD THAT

21:26.393 --> 21:27.426
WOMAN BE DEPORTED, BUT HE COULD

21:27.426 --> 21:27.993
ALSO SET PRECEDENT MAKING IT

21:27.993 --> 21:28.759
HARDER FOR OTHER DOMESTIC

21:28.759 --> 21:29.959
VIOLENCE VICTIMS TO GET ASYLUM.

21:29.959 --> 21:34.160
AND WHILE SESSIONS ISN'T THE

21:34.160 --> 21:37.926
EXACT LAST PERSON I'D WANT TO

21:37.926 --> 21:39.326
SET PRECEDENTS ON

21:39.326 --> 21:40.260
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE,

21:40.260 --> 21:41.026
HE'S PRETTY NEAR THE BOTTOM OF

21:41.026 --> 21:41.859
THAT LIST, RIGHT BEFORE

21:41.859 --> 21:44.126
OJ SIMPSON, JOHNNY DEPP, AND

21:44.126 --> 21:44.993
MR. PEANUT.

21:44.993 --> 21:46.226
AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT

21:46.226 --> 21:46.826
LAST ONE IS REFERRING TO, JUST

21:46.826 --> 21:47.893
GOOGLE "MR. PEANUT

21:47.893 --> 21:48.993
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE."

21:48.993 --> 21:50.293
HONESTLY, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

21:50.293 --> 21:52.859
YOU'LL FIND, BUT GIVE IT A TRY.

21:52.859 --> 21:55.559
WE MIGHT ALL BE SURPRISED.

21:55.559 --> 21:57.360
THE POINT HERE IS, WHEN YOU

21:57.360 --> 21:58.459
COMBINE ALL THESE FACTORS --

21:58.459 --> 21:59.926
BACKLOGGED COURTS,

21:59.926 --> 22:00.859
LACK OF REPRESENTATION,

22:00.859 --> 22:01.726
AND JUDGES WITHOUT

22:01.726 --> 22:03.793
FULL INDEPENDENCE --

22:03.793 --> 22:07.326
YOU CAN HAVE CASES THAT DON'T

22:07.326 --> 22:08.293
EVEN SEEM TO RESEMBLE JUSTICE.

22:08.293 --> 22:10.859
FOR EXAMPLE, A FEW MONTHS AGO,

22:10.859 --> 22:11.793
"THE NEW YORKER" TOLD THE STORY

22:11.793 --> 22:12.692
OF A WOMAN FROM HONDURAS WHO

22:12.692 --> 22:13.793
ASKED THEM TO IDENTIFY HER AS

22:13.793 --> 22:14.226
"ELENA."

22:14.226 --> 22:15.459
MS-13 KILLED TWO OF HER BROTHERS

22:15.459 --> 22:16.226
AND SHOT HER SISTER.

22:16.226 --> 22:17.926
SHE FLED TO AMERICA AND TURNED

22:17.926 --> 22:19.626
HERSELF IN TO BORDER PATROL.

22:19.626 --> 22:21.793
NOW, DHS SAID SHE DIDN'T QUALIFY

22:21.793 --> 22:23.093
FOR ASYLUM BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T

22:23.093 --> 22:24.193
PROVE CREDIBLE FEAR OF VIOLENCE

22:24.193 --> 22:26.626
BACK HOME.

22:26.626 --> 22:27.993
SO SHE APPEALED, REQUESTING A

22:27.993 --> 22:30.959
HEARING WITH AN IMMIGRATION

22:30.959 --> 22:31.726
JUDGE, AND I'M ABOUT TO PLAY IT

22:31.726 --> 22:32.893
FOR YOU IN ITS ENTIRETY.

22:32.893 --> 22:33.993
SERIOUSLY, THIS IS THE WHOLE

22:33.993 --> 22:36.626
THING.

22:36.626 --> 22:37.959
>> I HAVE READ WHAT

22:37.959 --> 22:39.393
THE ASYLUM OFFICER WROTE.

22:39.393 --> 22:40.592
YOU TOLD THE ASYLUM OFFICER THAT

22:40.592 --> 22:43.759
SOME GANG MEMBER BECAME

22:43.759 --> 22:45.826
INFATUATED WITH YOU, WANTED YOU

22:45.826 --> 22:50.226
TO BE WITH HIM, WANTED YOU TO

22:50.226 --> 22:51.426
OPEN A BANK ACCOUNT SO THE

22:51.426 --> 22:53.393
CRIMINAL PROCEEDS FROM

22:53.393 --> 22:54.826
THE GANG COULD BE PLACED THERE.

22:54.826 --> 22:59.459
AND YOU REFUSED.

22:59.459 --> 23:00.859
>> Translator: YES.

23:00.859 --> 23:01.959
I SAID NO.

23:01.959 --> 23:02.793
>> DID YOU MOVE TO ANY OTHER

23:02.793 --> 23:03.393
CITY IN HONDURAS BEFORE COMING

23:03.393 --> 23:06.893
TO THE UNITED STATES?

23:06.893 --> 23:07.826
>> Translator: NO.

23:07.826 --> 23:08.759
>> WELL, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE

23:08.759 --> 23:09.559
UNITED STATES DOESN'T AFFORD YOU

23:09.559 --> 23:10.492
PROTECTION FOR THIS TYPE OF

23:10.492 --> 23:11.260
REASON.

23:11.260 --> 23:12.226
I AFFIRM THE ASYLUM OFFICER'S

23:12.226 --> 23:13.160
DECISION.

23:13.160 --> 23:14.093
>> John: THAT WAS IT.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.093
"DID YOU MOVE?"

23:15.093 --> 23:16.293
"NO."

23:16.293 --> 23:17.726
"OKAY, GOODBYE."

23:17.726 --> 23:18.526
AND THANKS TO THAT HEARING,

23:18.526 --> 23:19.659
ELENA WAS DEPORTED BACK TO

23:19.659 --> 23:20.659
HONDURAS, WHERE SHE WAS

23:20.659 --> 23:21.993
ASSAULTED AT GUNPOINT BY THE

23:21.993 --> 23:23.059
GANG MEMBER SHE HAD FLED,

23:23.059 --> 23:28.260
BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT HER FEAR

23:28.260 --> 23:29.393
WAS PRETTY FUCKING CREDIBLE.

23:29.393 --> 23:30.726
WE TRIMMED THE PARTS WHERE A

23:30.726 --> 23:31.692
TRANSLATOR INTERPRETS BETWEEN

23:31.692 --> 23:32.659
HER AND THE JUDGE, BUT EVEN

23:32.659 --> 23:34.126
KEEPING ALL OF IT IN, THE FULL

23:34.126 --> 23:34.726
HEARING LASTED ONE MINUTE AND

23:34.726 --> 23:36.426
43 SECONDS.

23:36.426 --> 23:39.360
THERE WERE ONLY TWO QUESTIONS.

23:39.360 --> 23:40.393
FOR CONTEXT: THAT "HOT BENCH"

23:40.393 --> 23:41.260
EPISODE YOU SAW AT THE START

23:41.260 --> 23:48.692
WHERE THE DOG HAD WRITTEN A

23:48.692 --> 23:52.093
CONFESSION WAS EIGHT MINUTES

23:52.093 --> 23:52.893
LONG AND WE COUNTED

23:52.893 --> 23:53.526
32 QUESTIONS.

23:53.526 --> 23:54.293
WHICH IS ABSURD.

23:54.293 --> 23:55.026
THERE SHOULD'VE BEEN ONLY

23:55.026 --> 23:55.859
ONE QUESTION:

23:55.859 --> 23:56.592
HOW THE FUCK DID THAT DOG

23:56.592 --> 23:57.393
WRITE THIS LETTER?

23:57.393 --> 23:58.093
CASE DISMISSED.

23:58.093 --> 23:59.026
AND IN SOME CASES,

23:59.026 --> 23:59.926
DEPORTATIONS DO TURN OUT TO BE A

23:59.926 --> 24:00.793
DEATH SENTENCE.

24:00.793 --> 24:01.726
TAKE CONSTANTINO MORALES, A

24:01.726 --> 24:02.626
MEXICAN POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS

24:02.626 --> 24:03.293
TARGETED BY A DRUG CARTEL.

24:03.293 --> 24:04.293
HE FLED TO THE U.S. AND ENDED UP

24:04.293 --> 24:05.260
IN IMMIGRATION COURT IN

24:05.260 --> 24:06.360
NEBRASKA.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.793
HE COULDN'T AFFORD AN ATTORNEY,

24:07.793 --> 24:09.826
SO HE REPRESENTED HIMSELF IN

24:09.826 --> 24:10.726
COURT BEFORE A JUDGE WHO OPTS TO

24:10.726 --> 24:12.859
DEPORT 84% OF THE TIME.

24:12.859 --> 24:14.426
MORALES LOST HIS CASE AND FILMED

24:14.426 --> 24:15.526
THIS MESSAGE AFTER THE DECISION.

24:15.592 --> 24:26.826
>> Translator: I AM BEING

24:26.826 --> 24:27.726
DEPORTED.

24:27.726 --> 24:31.393
THEY ARE DEPORTING ME.

24:31.393 --> 24:32.193
IT WAS FOUR YEARS OF FIGHTING.

24:32.193 --> 24:33.093
MY REQUEST WAS DENIED, BUT YOU

24:33.093 --> 24:33.859
HAVE TO FIGHT TO THE END.

24:33.859 --> 24:34.626
DON'T BE SCARED, NO WORRIES,

24:34.626 --> 24:36.260
LIFE GOES ON.

24:36.260 --> 24:38.226
>> John: HE WAS DEPORTED BACK TO

24:38.226 --> 24:39.692
MEXICO, AND SIX MONTHS AND

24:39.692 --> 24:41.426
29 DAYS AFTER THAT DECISION, HE

24:41.426 --> 24:42.559
WAS KILLED.

24:42.559 --> 24:46.626
AND THAT IS FUCKING

24:46.626 --> 24:47.393
HEARTBREAKING, OBVIOUSLY.

24:47.393 --> 24:48.026
SO CLEARLY, THIS SYSTEM IS

24:48.026 --> 24:48.692
BROKEN.

24:48.692 --> 24:49.526
THE QUESTION IS, HOW CAN IT BE

24:49.526 --> 24:50.293
FIXED?

24:50.293 --> 24:50.926
SESSIONS HAS SAID HE WANTS TO

24:50.926 --> 24:53.326
HIRE MORE JUDGES, WHICH THE

24:53.326 --> 24:54.126
SYSTEM DOES NEED.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.492
BUT HE'S ALSO SAID HE WANTS THE

24:55.492 --> 24:56.293
JUDGES TO MOVE FASTER AND

24:56.293 --> 24:57.193
ADVOCATED FOR INCREASED SCRUTINY

24:57.193 --> 24:58.226
OF WHAT HE CALLS FAKE ASYLUM

24:58.226 --> 25:00.160
CLAIMS, WHICH SEEMS LIKE THE

25:00.160 --> 25:01.893
WRONG APPROACH.

25:01.893 --> 25:03.959
BECAUSE IMMIGRATION COURTS ARE A

25:03.959 --> 25:06.193
LOT LIKE SEX: THE WAY TO IMPROVE

25:06.193 --> 25:07.526
THEM IS RARELY TO SAY, "HEY,

25:07.526 --> 25:08.526
LET'S DO IT A LOT FASTER AND

25:08.526 --> 25:09.759
MEANER, AND LET'S HAVE

25:09.759 --> 25:11.293
JEFF SESSIONS OVERSEEING THE

25:11.293 --> 25:16.526
WHOLE THING."

25:16.526 --> 25:19.859
BUT THE TRUTH HERE IS, WE'RE

25:19.859 --> 25:21.126
GOING TO NEED BIG CHANGES.

25:21.126 --> 25:22.160
IDEALLY, THE BIGGEST CHANGE

25:22.160 --> 25:23.093
WOULD BE TO MAKE THE COURTS

25:23.093 --> 25:24.226
FULLY INDEPENDENT FROM THE DOJ,

25:24.226 --> 25:25.893
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT CAN'T

25:25.893 --> 25:28.160
HAPPEN OVERNIGHT, OR UNDER THIS

25:28.160 --> 25:28.826
PARTICULAR CONGRESS, PROBABLY AT

25:28.826 --> 25:30.426
ALL.

25:30.426 --> 25:31.360
BUT AT THE VERY LEAST, WE

25:31.360 --> 25:32.293
SHOULD ABSOLUTELY FIX THE

25:32.293 --> 25:33.160
STUPIDEST PROBLEM OF ALL, WHICH

25:33.160 --> 25:34.793
IS THAT NOBODY, PARTICULARLY

25:34.793 --> 25:35.426
CHILDREN, SHOULD HAVE TO

25:35.426 --> 25:36.959
REPRESENT THEMSELVES IN THESE

25:36.959 --> 25:38.293
COURTS.

25:38.293 --> 25:39.459
BECAUSE CHILDREN DO NOT

25:39.459 --> 25:42.126
UNDERSTAND THE LAW.

25:42.126 --> 25:43.126
HAVING THEM ALONE IN A COURTROOM

25:43.126 --> 25:44.859
IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

25:44.859 --> 25:46.226
AND TO PROVE IT TO YOU, I GIVE

25:46.226 --> 25:47.959
YOU THE STUPIDEST NEW COURT SHOW

25:47.959 --> 25:53.993
IMAGINABLE.

25:53.993 --> 25:55.393
>> Announcer: YOU'VE SEEN A

25:55.393 --> 25:57.592
LOT OF COURTROOM SHOWS, BUT

25:57.592 --> 26:00.592
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ONE LIKE THIS.

26:00.592 --> 26:01.592
>> ORDER!

26:01.592 --> 26:04.193
>> Announcer: THAT'S RIGHT, IN

26:04.193 --> 26:06.260
THIS COURTROOM, EVERYONE IS

26:06.260 --> 26:07.826
THREE OR 4 YEARS OLD.

26:07.826 --> 26:11.793
>> MY FAVORITE FOOD IS MANGO.

26:11.793 --> 26:14.193
>> Announcer: EVERYONE, THAT

26:14.193 --> 26:15.393
IS, EXCEPT THE DEFENDANT.

26:15.393 --> 26:19.393
>> OH, WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

26:19.393 --> 26:20.692
IS THIS A JOKE?

26:20.692 --> 26:22.826
>> Announcer: NO, THIS IS

26:22.826 --> 26:24.793
"TOT BENCH," AND IN THIS WEEK'S

26:24.793 --> 26:26.993
EPISODE, THIS ARSENATE IS IN THE

26:26.993 --> 26:27.260
HOT SEAT.

26:27.260 --> 26:29.193
>> YOU ARE BAD.

26:29.193 --> 26:30.993
BAD, BAD, BAD.

26:30.993 --> 26:35.193
GUILTY, GUILTY, GUILTY.

26:35.193 --> 26:36.993
>> OBJECT.

26:36.993 --> 26:37.293
JUST OBJECT.

26:37.293 --> 26:39.692
>> I OBJECT TO YOU.

26:39.692 --> 26:42.993
>> ITS OBJECT.

26:42.993 --> 26:44.793
>> Announcer: HE'S GOT THE

26:44.793 --> 26:45.759
BEST LEGAL ADVICE A 3-YEAR-OLD

26:45.759 --> 26:52.559
CAN GIVE.

26:52.559 --> 26:54.393
>> A BANANA AND A COW.

26:54.393 --> 26:56.393
>> WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

26:56.393 --> 26:58.993
A BANANA AND A COW?

26:58.993 --> 26:59.993
I DON'T KNOW, WHAT?

26:59.993 --> 27:03.360
>> A BANANA IS YELLOW.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.826
>> Announcer: "TOT BENCH" HAS

27:04.826 --> 27:05.126
EVERYTHING.

27:05.126 --> 27:07.360
A BAILIFF, A STENOGRAPHER.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.160
>> DO YOU EVEN KNOW MY NAME?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.492
>> DAVID SCHWIMMER.

27:09.492 --> 27:09.993
>> DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHO

27:09.993 --> 27:15.093
DAVID SCHWIMMER IS?

27:15.093 --> 27:18.393
>> "HACKSAW RIDGE."

27:18.393 --> 27:19.326
>> DAVID SCHWIMMER WASN'T EVEN

27:19.326 --> 27:20.093
IN "HACKSAW RIDGE."

27:20.093 --> 27:20.893
>> Announcer: A COURTROOM

27:20.893 --> 27:21.726
ARTIST.

27:21.726 --> 27:22.659
>> SO THERE IS A COURTROOM

27:22.659 --> 27:23.492
ARTIST NOW?

27:23.492 --> 27:24.360
GREAT.

27:24.360 --> 27:25.260
I'M SURE SHE'S TERRIBLE.

27:25.260 --> 27:26.293

28:25.360 --> 28:28.759
NUMBER.

28:28.759 --> 28:30.326
I MEAN, THIS WHOLE --
