FX presents Snowfall.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.709
I saw the notices
this morning.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.711
But if you wanted to help
your mama out.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.080
Franklin ain't no savior.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.347
You willing to lose this house?

00:13.381 --> 00:15.349
Yes, I would
fucking lose this house.

00:15.383 --> 00:18.652
Your days of slaving for that
Jheri curl motherfucker

00:18.686 --> 00:19.653
are over.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.089
Wanna come work for us?

00:21.122 --> 00:23.757
Oh, my God. Franklin,
I will not let you down.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.193
Just keep it to yourself,
all right?

00:25.226 --> 00:26.994
We're a family here.
Got to have trust.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.896
I know it's hard
to let someone in

00:28.929 --> 00:30.998
after what happened
to this family.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.367

00:33.401 --> 00:35.469

What does that make Pedro?

00:49.417 --> 00:51.018
Still nothing?

00:51.051 --> 00:53.020
I'd be a lot less calm
if there were.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.022
The real prize here is the pilot
and his partner.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.258
We get them and we've got
a shot at the Colombians.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.926
Well, we'd be happy to take
the weight.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.194
Make up the difference
next time.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.429
I like this guy.

01:03.097 --> 01:06.033
The people I use,
they don't get their money,

01:06.066 --> 01:07.568

01:07.601 --> 01:09.370
Hey, man, office.
Don't look at it.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.704
Just keep your eyes
straight ahead.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.473
Somebody's watching the office.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.942
You gonna tell me the truth
or keep feeding me shit, puta?

01:14.975 --> 01:16.610
What if I can offer you
the recipe?

01:16.644 --> 01:18.146
The Monarcas want your head.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.980

off for long.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.616
Delroy's dead.
Vic is dead.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.285
They castrated them!

01:24.318 --> 01:25.819

01:25.853 --> 01:27.721
Wanna know who killed
your friends?

01:27.755 --> 01:28.956
We can take you right to him.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.758
And why would you do that?

01:30.791 --> 01:32.960
'Cause you're gonna tell us
how to cook up that rock.

01:32.993 --> 01:35.963
I look forward to hearing
from you soon.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.308
Hey, Sosa.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.477
Let's get this straight now.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.182
I never fuck anybody over
in my life

01:54.215 --> 01:55.749
who didn't have it coming.

01:55.783 --> 01:56.984
You got that?

01:57.017 --> 01:58.819
Hey, why he talk like that?

01:58.852 --> 02:00.154
He from Cuba.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.755
Ain't they all from Cuba?

02:01.789 --> 02:03.324
I don't break them
for no one.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.758
Do you understand?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.260
See, that's what we need.

commandment.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.765
Hey, Saint,
words is just words, man.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.267
Boss is boss.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.668
(chuckles)
That ain't true.

02:14.702 --> 02:15.669
Hey, shut up, man!

02:15.703 --> 02:17.171
Hey, you shut the fuck up!

02:17.205 --> 02:18.672
I'm trying to watch
this fucking movie.

02:18.706 --> 02:19.940
Quiet down!
(laughter)

02:19.973 --> 02:21.475
Hey, can y'all be quiet?

02:21.509 --> 02:23.611
Hey, how many times you seen
this shit?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.346
I don't know, like,
five times.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.348
Bolivia.
Fuck, see what I mean?

02:27.381 --> 02:28.682
They got that whole
production line.

02:28.716 --> 02:29.950
All right,
so that means you expert.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.352
If they all from Cuba,

02:31.385 --> 02:32.886
why he the only one
that talk like that?

02:32.920 --> 02:34.655
Man, will y'all shut up?

02:34.688 --> 02:36.190

mass produce the burger.

into an empire,
