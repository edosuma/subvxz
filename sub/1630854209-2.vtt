All right, Bentley.
Your first crime scene.

00:20.855 --> 00:23.262
Hey, Sandeford,
who are those guys?

00:23.297 --> 00:25.528
SANDEFORD:
This is Chief Suarez.
He's the borough commander.

00:25.563 --> 00:26.661
You asked for Stan Yenko

00:26.696 --> 00:28.300

00:28.335 --> 00:30.302
I irritate people.
I know this about myself.

00:30.337 --> 00:31.600
I also want members

00:33.505 --> 00:34.768
Why'd you volunteer to do this,
Quinlan?

00:34.803 --> 00:37.144
Because I think this is
a good idea.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.443
Because of the shooting,
you're gonna have to go

Oh, God. I know.

00:40.611 --> 00:42.413

03:12.895 --> 03:14.499
Let's go.

03:14.534 --> 03:17.029
FROGGY:
Well, I-I don't know
anything about this.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.800
SANDEFORD:
You know the routine.

03:19.435 --> 03:21.902
(train rattling on tracks)

03:26.975 --> 03:29.316
Robbery numbers are way high,
Regina.

03:29.351 --> 03:31.681
One reason's that this
precinct's been shorthanded,

03:31.716 --> 03:33.419
particularly
on the 4:00 to 12:00,

03:33.454 --> 03:35.355
which is
when most robberies happen.

03:35.390 --> 03:36.620
What are we gonna do about that?

03:36.655 --> 03:37.885
One thing would be
to stop pulling uniforms

03:37.920 --> 03:39.557
out of command
to work parade details

03:39.592 --> 03:41.262
in Manhattan.

03:41.931 --> 03:44.397
And the clearance rate for
felonies, that's got to come up.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.926
Give me more detectives.

03:45.961 --> 03:48.302
The squad's being hollowed out
by early retirements

03:48.337 --> 03:50.700
and an unrealistic
overtime cap.

03:50.735 --> 03:51.833
I go upstairs
to the squad room,

03:51.868 --> 03:53.637
half the time
the room's half-empty.

03:53.672 --> 03:55.969
People get victimized.
They get mugged.

03:56.004 --> 03:58.774
And there's no investigation,
no follow-up, nothing.

03:58.809 --> 03:59.973
All right,
I'll tell you what.

04:00.008 --> 04:00.840
Give me a breakdown

04:00.876 --> 04:03.350
of crime stats
and personnel numbers,

04:03.385 --> 04:04.780
both patrol
and detectives.

04:04.815 --> 04:06.617
I'll make sure
the Chief of Patrol knows

04:06.652 --> 04:08.454
that we need more
than good intentions here.

04:08.489 --> 04:10.522

04:10.557 --> 04:14.295

gone to Psych Services.

04:17.465 --> 04:18.761
You know.

04:18.796 --> 04:20.796
This isn't optional, Regina.

04:20.831 --> 04:22.831
You were involved
in a fatal shooting.

04:22.866 --> 04:24.899
Regulations
require you

psychologist

04:27.101 --> 04:29.607

on your fitness for duty.

04:29.642 --> 04:32.940
I'll tell you something else,
I don't care for their offices.

04:32.975 --> 04:34.942
You're kidding me, right?
No, I'm not.

04:34.977 --> 04:37.549
I've gone before in the past,
let's not forget.

04:37.584 --> 04:38.781
It was a windowless office.

That's intense."

04:42.985 --> 04:44.490
Well, no doy,
that must be rough...
All right, hopefully

04:44.525 --> 04:45.755
that won't be true
for all of them,

04:45.790 --> 04:47.053

you go to will...

04:47.088 --> 04:48.659

He went to visit you

It's why I went to the hospital

Mm.

31:15.076 --> 31:16.476
Which is why you're here now.

31:16.511 --> 31:18.577

put that knife down?

the full resources

48 hours.

I know I said that

a "misdemeanor homicide"?

Huh.

All that would've done was get
you stripped of your command.
