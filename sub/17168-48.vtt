Walking all the way over there
is going to take forever, yo.

00:41.241 --> 00:44.609
The thing's manual.
Got to use your manuals.

00:44.611 --> 00:46.811
I ain't using my manuals
for nothing.

00:46.813 --> 00:51.149
Then are we to be forever
trapped in this suffering?

00:51.151 --> 00:52.851
No, no, I can't take it.

00:52.853 --> 00:58.156
Someone help.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Someone please! Just help!

00:58.158 --> 01:00.659
A cry for help.
Where's the danger?

01:00.661 --> 01:02.727
All around us, bro.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.564

done to you?

Made you soft?

01:18.211 --> 01:21.613
Not long ago,
we didn't have all these
modern conveniences.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.014
Every day was a hardship,

01:23.016 --> 01:25.684
but it made people strong
and self-reliant.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.420
In fact, I think a road trip
is in order.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.155
A road trip? That sounds fun.

01:30.157 --> 01:33.692
Well, it's not.
This road trip will be
educational!

self-reliance in an

life for themselves.

-It won't take a couple

-ALL: Phew.

02:03.223 --> 02:07.459
It'll take several months

Robin, what is this Y or N?

02:26.046 --> 02:28.713
Y or N!

02:28.715 --> 02:30.181
Y means yes, N means no.

02:30.183 --> 02:31.816
Then why not just say
yes or no?

02:31.818 --> 02:33.184
Because it's faster this way.

02:33.186 --> 02:36.721
Yes and no are like the
shortest words already.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.456
And now they're even
shorter.

might start their journey?

We will probably eat Hug-head

09:33.540 --> 09:35.373
I made it to the Dalles river.

09:35.375 --> 09:39.010
Would I like to look around?
Y or N?

09:39.012 --> 09:40.678
You bet, Y!

09:41.213 --> 09:42.947
(BIRDS CAWING)

09:42.949 --> 09:44.182
Ah, majestic.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.150
It was all worth it.

09:46.152 --> 09:48.286
How's looking around going,
bro?

09:48.288 --> 09:49.887
-(SLURPING)
-Great!

09:49.889 --> 09:52.423
Now all I have to do is
float this cart across
the river,

09:52.425 --> 09:54.125
and I'll be in Oregon!

09:54.127 --> 09:57.328
Besides hunting, this is
the only fun part of the
Oregon Trail.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.864
RAVEN: More fun than our
ghost yacht?

09:59.866 --> 10:02.033
-(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
-Whoo, look at all these
ghost babes!

10:02.035 --> 10:03.668
(LAUGHS)

10:03.670 --> 10:05.136
Just give it up, dude.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.304
This yachts booming.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.772
Come on board!

10:07.774 --> 10:09.073
ROBIN: Never!

10:09.075 --> 10:11.442
I will ride this trail
to the very end.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.711
And there's nothing you can
do to stop me.

10:16.181 --> 10:17.482
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

10:18.750 --> 10:21.586
Phew, looks like it's all
smooth sailing from here.

10:22.654 --> 10:23.721
(SCREAMS)

10:24.623 --> 10:26.357
(GROANS)

10:30.195 --> 10:32.730
(COUGHING)

10:32.732 --> 10:35.500
(WHEEZING) Congratulations.
I've made it

10:35.502 --> 10:37.034
to Oregon.

10:37.036 --> 10:38.569
Good job, bro.

10:38.571 --> 10:41.272
Can you tell us what you
learned from your boring
journey?

10:41.274 --> 10:42.707
That Robin has dysentery.

10:42.709 --> 10:43.708
(STOMACH RUMBLING)
