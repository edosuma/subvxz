01:40.512 --> 01:41.629
Arthur Brennan.

01:41.631 --> 01:43.771
Um, okay.

01:43.773 --> 01:47.063
Where will you be traveling to,
Mr. Brennan?

01:47.065 --> 01:48.053
Tokyo.

01:50.227 --> 01:51.920
Um...

01:52.592 --> 01:54.444
When did you book your ticket?

01:56.810 --> 01:58.023
Last night.

01:58.025 --> 01:59.078
Let me help you.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.356
Mmh.

02:01.380 --> 02:02.625
Here it is.

02:02.627 --> 02:05.054
Would you like to book
your return flight now?

02:06.557 --> 02:07.706
No.

02:07.708 --> 02:08.824
All right.

02:08.827 --> 02:11.382
I need your bags
up here, please.

02:11.384 --> 02:13.267
I don't have any.

02:13.269 --> 02:16.239
Just the carry on.
Okay, you're all set.

02:16.241 --> 02:18.668
You'll be leaving
out of gate 43.

02:18.670 --> 02:21.288
Boarding begins
in about an hour.

02:22.951 --> 02:24.484
Have a good flight.

02:30.109 --> 02:31.163
Hi.

03:08.523 --> 03:09.831
Step back up, please.

03:13.412 --> 03:15.296
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:15.298 --> 03:17.533
Welcome aboard Ana.

03:17.535 --> 03:21.271
This is a co-shared flight
with our star lines partners.

03:23.926 --> 03:27.056
Sir, are you sure you don't
want anything to eat?

03:28.879 --> 03:30.475
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.617
Please let us know
if you change your mind.

11:47.025 --> 11:48.238
Hey.

11:49.102 --> 11:50.188
Hey!

11:54.183 --> 11:55.365
Excuse me.

12:03.316 --> 12:04.368
Hey.

12:05.008 --> 12:06.413
You okay?

12:15.459 --> 12:17.535
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.941
Are you okay?

12:21.627 --> 12:22.904
Water?

12:28.720 --> 12:30.318
Easy.
Slow, slow, slow.

12:30.862 --> 12:32.427
Are you lost?

12:32.429 --> 12:33.897
Yeah...

12:33.899 --> 12:35.942
I cannot find the way out.

12:35.944 --> 12:38.147
Please.
Please help me.

12:38.149 --> 12:41.024
Okay, look.
Listen to me.

12:41.026 --> 12:42.813
The trail is right there.

12:42.815 --> 12:45.146
Okay?
Go that way.

12:45.148 --> 12:46.583
It will lead you out of here.

12:47.416 --> 12:48.821
Straight ahead.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.768
He didn't find the trail.

14:22.008 --> 14:23.542
Are you with anyone?

14:25.843 --> 14:27.312
Are you with anyone?

14:27.314 --> 14:28.463
No.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.778
Thank you.

14:50.738 --> 14:52.111
I have to find it.

14:52.113 --> 14:53.645
Okay, it must be this way.

14:58.695 --> 15:00.516
I walked that direction.

15:00.518 --> 15:02.625
I could not find any trail.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.631
You don't want to leave.

15:14.633 --> 15:15.910
I do.

15:18.403 --> 15:19.872
You came here alone.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.854
Please...

15:21.856 --> 15:23.867
I want to go home
to my family.

15:32.496 --> 15:33.837
This way.

15:36.140 --> 15:37.992
Now listen, do you...

15:37.994 --> 15:39.845
Do you have a cell phone?

15:39.847 --> 15:42.147
It would not work
even if I did.

15:43.745 --> 15:45.662
Did you drive yourself here?

15:45.664 --> 15:46.716
No.

15:47.516 --> 15:49.784
Well, how will you get
to the hospital?

15:49.786 --> 15:51.158
I will.

15:51.446 --> 15:52.692
Okay.

15:56.560 --> 15:57.901
This is it.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.288
The trail.
- Trail?

16:01.290 --> 16:02.758
- It's the trail.
- Is it?

16:02.760 --> 16:05.027
Yes, yes.
Okay.

16:05.029 --> 16:06.945
Yes, I see.
I see trail.

16:06.947 --> 16:08.351
Follow it that way.

16:08.353 --> 16:10.012
It'll bring you back
to the parking lot. Okay?

16:10.014 --> 16:12.026
Yes. Yes.

16:12.028 --> 16:13.304
Go.

16:14.615 --> 16:16.596
Go.
- Thank you. Thank you.

16:16.598 --> 16:18.865
Thank you.
- Okay, go.

16:18.867 --> 16:20.175
Go.

16:36.219 --> 16:38.422
Hey! Hey!

16:40.630 --> 16:41.746
Wait!

16:43.409 --> 16:45.805
Forgot something
in my jacket.

16:47.851 --> 16:49.927
This is not right trail.

17:21.117 --> 17:23.419
I think you'll love it.
The house is amazing.

17:24.888 --> 17:27.988
Exactly.
It's very private.

17:27.990 --> 17:30.034
Okay.
That sounds great.

17:30.036 --> 17:33.165
We can meet tomorrow
at the seller's residence.

17:33.167 --> 17:34.986
Eight o'clock.
Perfect.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.776
Thanks.
Bye.

17:39.302 --> 17:40.291
What happened?

17:40.293 --> 17:41.921
The tank overflowed.

17:41.923 --> 17:42.944
Oh...

17:42.946 --> 17:44.733
I have some of those things.

17:44.735 --> 17:45.979
What things?

17:45.981 --> 17:48.697
Those... hand wipes.

17:48.698 --> 17:50.390
- Good.
- Here.

17:57.133 --> 17:58.411
Thank you.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.711
<i> So I have</i>
<i> another showing tomorrow.</i>

18:07.713 --> 18:09.148
That's great, I heard.

18:10.141 --> 18:12.920
It's right by the college.
I could drop by after.

18:14.039 --> 18:15.668
Tomorrow I'm pretty busy.

18:15.670 --> 18:17.011
Well, how 'bout
a quick lunch then?

18:17.013 --> 18:19.407
I could pick up something
on the way over.

18:19.409 --> 18:23.338
Yeah, I really don't
have time tomorrow.

18:23.339 --> 18:25.351
Okay. Never mind.

18:33.661 --> 18:36.281
Can you see if my lipstick's
in the glove compartment?

18:37.655 --> 18:38.805
Sure.

18:39.158 --> 18:40.754
Mm-hmm...

18:45.932 --> 18:48.392
Mmh... nope.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.533
No, it's not in there.

18:50.535 --> 18:52.035
What are you doin'?

18:52.037 --> 18:54.112
Jesus, Joan.
- Did you look good?

18:54.114 --> 18:55.614
Well? Is that it?

18:55.616 --> 18:57.021
Yeah.

18:57.023 --> 18:58.490
I didn't see it.

18:58.492 --> 19:00.089
'Cause you didn't look.

19:00.090 --> 19:01.782
You watched me.

19:01.784 --> 19:03.188
Forget it.

19:04.147 --> 19:06.927
You did the same thing
with the baking powder.

19:06.929 --> 19:08.174
With the baking powder?

19:08.176 --> 19:09.516
Forget it.

19:09.518 --> 19:11.146
No, obviously you're
not forgetting it.

19:11.148 --> 19:12.519
What about the baking powder?

19:12.521 --> 19:13.766
It was right there
in the pantry.

19:13.768 --> 19:15.651
Right in front of your face.
- Jesus Christ, Joan.

19:15.653 --> 19:18.176
Are we really gonna fight
about this, huh?

19:18.178 --> 19:19.933
You don't care.

19:19.935 --> 19:21.436
I don't care about what?

19:21.438 --> 19:23.129
Your mind's always
somewhere else.

19:23.131 --> 19:24.472
Okay, well what
groundbreaking thought

19:24.474 --> 19:26.421
kept me from finding
your fucking lipstick?

19:26.423 --> 19:27.795
Go ahead, mock me.

19:27.797 --> 19:31.470
When you're being this
ridiculous, you deserve it.

19:31.472 --> 19:33.132
You're driving home.

19:34.826 --> 19:36.168
Great.

19:37.798 --> 19:37.797
What happened?

19:37.799 --> 19:41.057
Well, it turns out
my student-teacher

19:41.059 --> 19:46.874
submitted my fantasy football
results instead of my paper.

19:46.876 --> 19:50.549
And here I was thinking
my calculations were wrong.

19:50.551 --> 19:53.552
Well, at least that explains
why you got rejected.

19:53.554 --> 19:54.895
That it does.

19:56.031 --> 19:57.723
Are you planning
on resubmitting?

19:57.725 --> 20:00.056
Hmm, who knows?
Maybe.

20:01.335 --> 20:02.773
What about you, Arthur?

20:02.774 --> 20:04.434
- My article?
- Yeah.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.799
Um, I think it might
have a chance

20:06.801 --> 20:08.109
in some smaller journals...

20:08.111 --> 20:08.109
- Uh-huh.
- ...Actually.

20:08.111 --> 20:11.592
Oh, absolutely.
It's a fantastic article.

20:11.594 --> 20:13.638
Thank you.
We'll see. We'll see.

20:15.397 --> 20:16.769
Have you read it, Joan?

20:16.771 --> 20:18.495
- Hmm?
- Have you read it?

20:18.497 --> 20:19.805
No.

20:19.807 --> 20:21.404
She doesn't read my work.

20:22.108 --> 20:23.161
Sorry.

20:23.769 --> 20:25.558
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

20:25.559 --> 20:27.795
I don't... appraise your houses.

20:27.797 --> 20:29.169
I just...

20:29.171 --> 20:31.214
...think he should be pursuing
other opportunities

20:31.216 --> 20:34.026
instead of waiting around
trying to get published.

20:34.028 --> 20:35.273
Publication in
the right journal

20:35.275 --> 20:36.966
can do wonders
for an adjunct's career.

20:36.968 --> 20:38.213
Mm-hmm.

20:38.215 --> 20:39.747
So can change of profession.

20:39.749 --> 20:41.408
Oh, stop it, Joan.

20:41.410 --> 20:42.943
- Stop what?
- Please.

20:44.221 --> 20:46.553
You think it's right your wife
does all the heavy lifting

20:46.555 --> 20:48.343
so you can pretend
to be an intellectual?

20:48.345 --> 20:50.388
Is that right, honey?

20:50.390 --> 20:52.114
See, belittling me...

20:52.116 --> 20:54.063
...does wonders
for Joan's self-esteem.

20:54.065 --> 20:56.460
Now, having an audience
compounds that effect,

20:56.462 --> 20:58.793
so consider your presence
tonight medicinal.

20:58.795 --> 21:01.477
Right, dear? Hmm?
- Cheers. Cheers to that.

21:01.479 --> 21:02.756
Right, Joan?

21:22.538 --> 21:25.509
Well, that's good.
Ruin my work.

22:38.788 --> 22:40.800
We can't keep doing this.

23:17.024 --> 23:18.334
Hey.

23:18.336 --> 23:19.932
How long have you been here?

23:19.934 --> 23:21.370
Two days.

23:23.576 --> 23:24.886
Like this?

23:29.520 --> 23:30.894
Give me your tie.

24:08.892 --> 24:10.072
You'll freeze.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.990
- Come on.
- Take coat.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.939
- I don't want the coat.
- Please, take coat.

24:13.941 --> 24:15.346
I don't want the coat.

24:15.348 --> 24:17.263
I want to find the trail.

24:17.265 --> 24:18.478
Come on.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.082
Ah.

24:56.283 --> 24:57.625
Grab the root.

25:15.841 --> 25:17.151
Why are you doing this?

25:17.153 --> 25:18.173
Huh?

25:18.175 --> 25:19.867
Why do you wanna die?

25:22.105 --> 25:23.893
I do not want to die.

25:25.269 --> 25:26.929
Then why are you here?

25:27.602 --> 25:30.349
It is... I didn't want to live.

25:34.184 --> 25:35.845
What's the difference?

25:35.847 --> 25:38.051
My company sent me
to the document...

25:38.053 --> 25:39.871
...research department...

25:39.873 --> 25:41.789
...after I make a mistake.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.930
It was a demotion.

25:43.932 --> 25:45.241
A job?

25:46.712 --> 25:48.373
That's why you're doing this?

25:49.268 --> 25:51.664
You do not get real work.

25:51.666 --> 25:53.549
Nobody speaks to you.

25:53.551 --> 25:56.425
You are there,
but you are not.

25:56.427 --> 25:58.087
Without job...

25:58.089 --> 25:59.941
...i cannot take care
of my family.

26:02.627 --> 26:04.446
So you come here instead...

26:04.448 --> 26:06.268
You do not understand
my culture.

26:06.270 --> 26:07.387
No.

26:08.379 --> 26:09.720
No, I don't.

26:34.072 --> 26:35.669
What's wrong?

26:35.671 --> 26:37.171
Are you okay?

26:42.828 --> 26:44.298
Just dizzy.

27:06.476 --> 27:07.690
Hello?

27:08.138 --> 27:09.639
Is anybody there?!

27:11.302 --> 27:12.867
Hello?!

27:14.338 --> 27:15.967
Hello!

27:19.547 --> 27:21.303
There is no one.

27:21.944 --> 27:23.285
Then what was that?

27:24.469 --> 27:26.034
Tamashii.

27:26.036 --> 27:27.407
What's tamashii?

27:28.015 --> 27:30.986
Tamashii are spirits.

27:30.988 --> 27:33.224
They are souls
wandering these woods

27:33.225 --> 27:35.141
until it is their time.

27:35.143 --> 27:37.027
Things are not
what they seem here.

27:37.029 --> 27:38.944
It was probably just an animal.

27:38.946 --> 27:41.725
There are very few animals
in aokigahara.

27:41.727 --> 27:43.578
Well, then it was
one of the few.

27:44.980 --> 27:48.653
This place
is what you call purgatory.

27:48.655 --> 27:50.795
Now, why would I call it that?

27:50.797 --> 27:52.201
Because you are American.

27:52.203 --> 27:54.533
- So?
- You believe in god.

28:02.652 --> 28:04.024
I'm a scientist.

28:04.026 --> 28:05.367
There are answers for this
in science?

28:05.369 --> 28:07.636
There are answers
for everything in science.

28:07.638 --> 28:09.489
But not in god?

28:09.491 --> 28:11.950
God is more our creation
than we are his.

28:11.952 --> 28:14.699
So... why end your life?

28:17.096 --> 28:18.214
Excuse me?

28:18.215 --> 28:20.611
If god is not waiting for you
on the other side,

28:20.613 --> 28:21.953
who is?

28:25.820 --> 28:27.449
Why do you want to die?

28:29.719 --> 28:31.284
I'm here sightseeing.

28:32.116 --> 28:33.649
For sightseeing?

28:34.800 --> 28:35.886
What?

28:35.888 --> 28:37.803
I don't know
who the hell you are...

28:39.242 --> 28:40.680
...but I stopped to help you.

28:40.682 --> 28:42.757
- You did.
- Yeah, I did.

29:08.133 --> 29:09.281
Hey!

29:22.928 --> 29:25.419
I can't... can't move.

29:38.970 --> 29:40.950
Get away from me.

29:40.952 --> 29:42.260
I don't want your help.

29:47.087 --> 29:49.420
'Cause... 'Cause of a job?

29:49.421 --> 29:50.441
Huh?

29:50.443 --> 29:51.816
You got a wife and kid
to go home to

29:51.818 --> 29:53.286
and that's not enough for you.
- On three!

29:53.288 --> 29:55.043
- No, what are you doing?
- One!

29:55.045 --> 29:56.354
Two! Three!
- No! No!

32:29.397 --> 32:30.930
Hi.

32:31.474 --> 32:32.752
You okay?

32:32.754 --> 32:33.966
Yeah.

32:33.968 --> 32:36.075
I'm sorry.
I must've dozed off.

32:40.007 --> 32:42.115
Is this the jacket
i bought you?

32:43.395 --> 32:44.575
Yeah.

32:46.078 --> 32:47.418
You like it?

32:48.985 --> 32:50.422
It's comfortable.

32:53.587 --> 32:54.960
You okay?

32:57.198 --> 32:59.306
You could've burned
the house down, Joan.

33:00.170 --> 33:02.215
I said I was sorry.

33:02.217 --> 33:05.698
I almost stopped off
at the store on the way home.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.391
If I had...
- Yeah, yeah.

33:07.393 --> 33:08.957
The house would be
in ashes right now.

33:08.959 --> 33:09.692
Okay?

33:10.429 --> 33:11.802
Is me telling you
how right you are

33:11.804 --> 33:14.454
enough to keep this from
turning into an argument?

33:21.901 --> 33:24.105
It's not the house
that I was concerned about.

33:31.903 --> 33:33.341
You're home early.

33:33.981 --> 33:35.961
Should I feel about that too?

33:35.963 --> 33:38.070
It was just
an observation, Joan.

33:38.072 --> 33:39.700
You see it all, don't you?

33:41.490 --> 33:43.088
Yeah. You know what?
I do.

33:43.090 --> 33:45.164
I see it all.

33:45.166 --> 33:46.539
I see you stopped by the bar.

33:47.563 --> 33:50.662
I did, right after I sold
my second house this week.

33:50.664 --> 33:52.419
Well, I'd say
we should celebrate,

33:52.421 --> 33:53.730
but obviously
you already have.

33:53.731 --> 33:55.167
I'm a grown woman.

33:55.169 --> 33:56.701
You're a cliché.

33:56.703 --> 33:58.939
I'm a grown woman.

33:58.941 --> 34:00.504
That's an alcoholic.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.166
Funny how
the so-called alcoholic's

34:02.168 --> 34:04.147
the one who pays the mortgage.

34:04.149 --> 34:05.969
What's your excuse?
- For what?

34:05.971 --> 34:07.919
Get a job.

34:07.921 --> 34:09.963
- I have a job.
- A real job.

34:09.965 --> 34:12.775
Not one that pays
20 grand a year.

34:12.777 --> 34:14.214
I like what I do, Joan.

34:14.216 --> 34:17.409
Uh-huh, about as much
as you like that jacket.

34:17.411 --> 34:21.212
- Like I said, it's--
- comfortable. Yeah, I know.

34:21.214 --> 34:22.650
What's wrong with that?

34:22.652 --> 34:24.920
- You don't care anymore.
- About what?

34:24.922 --> 34:26.166
Anything!
It's like you've settled

34:26.168 --> 34:29.297
on some lesser version
of yourself.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.895
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

34:30.897 --> 34:33.804
Because I'm too busy
feeling bad for myself.

34:33.806 --> 34:35.433
At least you admit it.

34:35.435 --> 34:35.433
Admit what?

34:35.435 --> 34:38.949
That I have a husband that
continuously puts himself first

34:38.951 --> 34:40.802
and I'm such a fool
that I keep letting him do it?

34:40.804 --> 34:42.016
Fine! Yeah, I admit it.

34:42.018 --> 34:43.870
You.
You were the one...

34:43.871 --> 34:45.244
...that said I should
quit northlab.

34:45.246 --> 34:46.619
That was you!
- Because you hated it there!

34:46.621 --> 34:49.558
No, because you hated me there!
Remember?

34:49.560 --> 34:50.741
You hated me there!

34:50.743 --> 34:52.147
Are you really gonna
go down that road?

34:52.149 --> 34:54.192
No, I don't.
But apparently you do.

34:54.194 --> 34:55.279
As usual.

34:55.281 --> 34:57.739
You quit three years ago.

34:57.741 --> 34:59.369
I figured you'd
find something else by now.

34:59.371 --> 35:00.839
And I have.

35:00.841 --> 35:02.628
Really? Yeah?

35:03.314 --> 35:04.336
Please.

35:04.338 --> 35:06.349
Don't give me "please."
I have.

35:06.351 --> 35:08.586
You could be doing a hell
of a lot more and you know it.

35:10.792 --> 35:13.187
Stop pretending this has
anything to do with the job.

35:13.189 --> 35:14.722
It has to do with you

35:14.724 --> 35:16.607
continuing to take advantage
of me.

35:16.609 --> 35:17.726
Name one time--

35:17.728 --> 35:19.803
- there's been plenty.
- Yeah?

35:19.804 --> 35:22.200
'Cause god forbid you could
take care of me for once.

35:22.202 --> 35:23.350
What are you talkin' about?

35:23.352 --> 35:24.948
- It's what you do.
- What?

35:24.950 --> 35:27.761
You... you take advantage
of people.

35:27.762 --> 35:29.901
Yet you can't give me
any example of when I have.

35:29.903 --> 35:31.978
You can't think of anybody
but yourself.

35:31.980 --> 35:34.471
If people need you,
when I need you,

35:34.473 --> 35:35.749
there is always something!

35:35.751 --> 35:37.986
There is always something
more important to do!

35:37.988 --> 35:39.201
Or...

35:40.864 --> 35:42.204
...or someone.

35:47.159 --> 35:48.372
I knew it.

35:52.144 --> 35:53.646
I knew you couldn't do it.

35:54.573 --> 35:56.745
I knew you couldn't do it.

35:56.747 --> 35:57.895
Well...

35:58.696 --> 36:00.228
You couldn't keep
from bringing it up.

36:00.230 --> 36:02.242
Could you?
- Well, you...

36:02.243 --> 36:03.903
...make it really hard
not to sometimes.

36:03.905 --> 36:05.757
You couldn't keep
from bringing it up.

36:06.940 --> 36:09.848
You had me in the crosshairs
for three years, baby.

36:09.850 --> 36:11.541
- This is how we are.
- Let's drink on it.

36:11.543 --> 36:13.331
You and me, let's have a toast

36:13.333 --> 36:15.952
to the reason that you,
miss Joan Brennan,

36:15.954 --> 36:17.102
are a drunk.

36:17.646 --> 36:18.955
Let's have a toast to me,

36:18.957 --> 36:21.800
your philandering,
selfish husband.

36:21.802 --> 36:23.142
Mmh.

36:27.203 --> 36:28.958
I'm done trying
to make amends with you.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.323
- Well, you shouldn't be!
- Well, I am.

37:43.227 --> 37:44.728
Are you okay?

37:48.116 --> 37:49.362
I'm just tired.

37:49.363 --> 37:50.704
Do you need to rest?

37:58.598 --> 37:59.876
You need these?

38:14.513 --> 38:16.717
Hey, talk to me.

38:16.719 --> 38:17.931
What's your name?

38:18.635 --> 38:19.913
Takumi.

38:20.681 --> 38:21.958
That your whole name?

38:21.960 --> 38:23.652
Nakamura takumi.

38:25.678 --> 38:27.306
Tell me about your family.

38:27.308 --> 38:28.809
My wife...

38:29.448 --> 38:30.822
...kiiro...

38:31.781 --> 38:34.017
...she's so smart...

38:34.019 --> 38:35.295
...charming.

38:36.255 --> 38:39.259
We have one daughter, fuyu.

38:41.783 --> 38:43.221
Sorry I yelled...

38:45.139 --> 38:47.247
...at you, earlier.

38:47.249 --> 38:48.973
Maybe I deserved.

38:48.975 --> 38:50.252
No.

38:50.254 --> 38:51.593
No, you didn't.

38:53.928 --> 38:56.163
Hey... what?

38:57.347 --> 38:58.688
What is it?

38:59.233 --> 39:01.212
Wh... what now?

39:01.214 --> 39:02.491
Water.

39:05.593 --> 39:06.773
Water?

39:07.414 --> 39:09.170
Yes, this way!

39:09.970 --> 39:11.119
Oh!

39:23.329 --> 39:25.404
Wait, wait.
How do you know
it's okay to drink?

39:27.642 --> 39:30.070
I do not, but would rather
get sick later

39:30.072 --> 39:31.508
than die tonight.

39:31.510 --> 39:32.722
Good point.

39:33.969 --> 39:35.886
Oh... oh.

39:42.693 --> 39:44.035
For later.

39:44.355 --> 39:45.473
Ah.

39:46.912 --> 39:48.956
We should follow it downstream.

39:48.958 --> 39:50.906
It is best way to find help.

39:51.610 --> 39:53.015
Ah!

39:53.591 --> 39:54.708
What's that?

39:54.710 --> 39:57.393
Ancient Japanese
survival technique?

39:57.395 --> 39:58.799
No, no.

39:58.801 --> 40:00.845
I learned on discovery channel.

40:00.847 --> 40:02.570
<i> Man vs. Wild.</i>

40:04.297 --> 40:05.446
Ah.

40:07.972 --> 40:09.122
Oh.

40:46.671 --> 40:48.396
Mount fuji...

40:48.398 --> 40:50.154
...where is it?

40:50.156 --> 40:52.678
We could use it
to get our bearings.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.469
The parking lot was just...

40:54.470 --> 40:55.843
...just west of the mountain.

40:55.845 --> 40:57.440
East.

40:57.442 --> 40:58.655
Are you sure?

41:03.897 --> 41:05.813
Hey, hey!

41:06.197 --> 41:07.443
Where you going?

41:16.999 --> 41:18.724
It is said
a flower grows

41:18.726 --> 41:21.791
when a should has crossed over
from this place.

41:23.999 --> 41:25.690
There's hardly any soil.

41:27.481 --> 41:28.471
Yeah.

41:36.302 --> 41:37.866
We should continue.

42:08.897 --> 42:10.430
What do we do now?

42:14.170 --> 42:16.086
I don't know.
It was your idea.

42:26.857 --> 42:28.742
What is that?
- What?

42:29.733 --> 42:31.011
Right there.

42:35.454 --> 42:36.763
Someone's there.

42:37.275 --> 42:38.425
Hey.

42:38.809 --> 42:40.214
Hello?

43:09.968 --> 43:11.309
He's German.

43:11.310 --> 43:13.577
There are many others
like him.

43:13.579 --> 43:15.591
They come from many countries.

43:16.230 --> 43:18.115
Some are certain of this.

43:18.117 --> 43:19.681
Others change mind.

43:23.805 --> 43:25.625
Help me take off his clothes.

44:16.965 --> 44:18.753
The mri detected a small mass.

44:18.755 --> 44:19.776
No.

44:20.612 --> 44:24.892
Right now it's pressing
against your frontal lobe.

44:43.966 --> 44:45.723
If you choose resection,

44:45.725 --> 44:47.992
which I highly recommend
you do...

44:47.994 --> 44:49.909
...your recovery
will not be swift.

44:54.799 --> 44:58.026
It's okay. It's okay.

44:58.028 --> 44:59.336
We got this.

44:59.880 --> 45:01.797
How risky is the surgery?

45:02.885 --> 45:05.472
It's a highly
invasive procedure.

45:05.474 --> 45:07.166
Could I die doing it?

45:09.915 --> 45:13.205
- It's possible.
- - But unlikely, right?

45:13.207 --> 45:14.644
But unlikely?

45:31.039 --> 45:33.594
Uh, 24, I got c.

45:33.596 --> 45:35.352
2400 joules.

45:35.992 --> 45:39.219
Uh, I couldn't figure out 25.

45:39.221 --> 45:40.817
I couldn't figure out
any of them.

45:40.818 --> 45:42.766
It's b, potential energy.

45:42.768 --> 45:45.642
- For 25?
- Yeah?

45:45.644 --> 45:46.952
Professor?

45:52.962 --> 45:55.101
It's velocity, Trey.

45:56.125 --> 45:57.913
The question is
was the velocity positive

45:57.915 --> 45:59.384
or was it negative.

46:00.471 --> 46:01.684
Anyone?

46:02.197 --> 46:03.314
Simon?

46:03.316 --> 46:04.720
We're on 25.

46:04.722 --> 46:06.798
We're on 26.
The answer's negative.

46:06.799 --> 46:10.185
It's negative velocity.
Why is it negative velocity?

46:10.187 --> 46:11.591
You know why?

46:13.414 --> 46:13.413
Anna.
- Yeah?

46:13.415 --> 46:16.289
Take over.
Run through the quiz
with the rest of the class.

46:16.291 --> 46:18.718
Remember that
there's still a force

46:18.720 --> 46:20.603
if the velocity is zero.

46:20.605 --> 46:23.734
Okay... anybody got 27?

46:24.982 --> 46:26.228
We didn't even
go over this stuff.

46:26.229 --> 46:27.538
I know, he just kinda
walked out.

46:33.131 --> 46:34.153
Excuse me.

46:34.888 --> 46:36.997
Sorry, I just need
to grab that.

46:46.362 --> 46:48.182
Hey, hey, talk to me.

46:48.184 --> 46:49.715
About anything.
Talk to me.

46:49.717 --> 46:51.090
I'm so cold.

46:51.092 --> 46:52.752
I know. Me too.

46:54.127 --> 46:55.948
Tell me about that song
you were singing.

46:55.949 --> 46:57.322
- Song?
- Yeah, yeah.

46:57.324 --> 46:58.728
Down by the water.

46:58.730 --> 47:00.805
I don't know.
Maybe I make up.

47:00.807 --> 47:03.266
Y-y-you kept saying the line...

47:05.791 --> 47:08.379
"Rakue... uno...

47:08.381 --> 47:10.232
...Kai-Kai-kaidan..."

47:10.234 --> 47:11.543
<i> Rakuen eno kaidan.</i>

47:11.545 --> 47:12.917
- Uh-huh?
<i> - Hai.</i>

47:12.919 --> 47:15.378
It's old song.
- Okay.

47:15.379 --> 47:17.870
Kaidan means "stairway."

47:17.872 --> 47:20.491
"Stairway to paradise."

47:22.506 --> 47:24.293
Like "stair-stairway
to heaven"?

47:24.295 --> 47:26.882
No, no. Different.

47:26.884 --> 47:28.320
Much shorter.

47:28.322 --> 47:29.598
That's funny.

47:29.600 --> 47:32.283
It's... it's from movie.

47:33.274 --> 47:34.967
American movies.

47:35.703 --> 47:37.268
Gene Kelly.
- Uh-huh?

47:38.900 --> 47:40.527
Why do you love the song?

47:40.529 --> 47:41.837
Why do you love this song?

47:41.839 --> 47:44.555
I'm most happy
near the water.

47:44.556 --> 47:46.152
It is my paradise.

47:47.846 --> 47:50.530
The song make me think
of good memories there.

47:53.025 --> 47:54.876
That's where you should go
when you get out of here.

47:54.878 --> 47:56.922
You hear me? Hey!
That's where you should go.

47:56.924 --> 47:58.711
- I like that.
- Okay.

48:00.917 --> 48:02.354
Will you?

48:06.094 --> 48:07.468
I don't know.

48:15.074 --> 48:16.862
Gotta find shelter.

48:16.864 --> 48:18.844
We can't... stay here.

48:37.226 --> 48:38.854
Over here!

48:39.495 --> 48:40.613
I'm here!

48:54.195 --> 48:55.472
In here!

49:06.210 --> 49:08.095
Look at me.
Listen to me.

49:08.097 --> 49:09.757
Listen to me.
We're gonna be okay.

49:09.759 --> 49:11.706
I promise you I'm gonna
get you out of here.

49:11.708 --> 49:13.049
You hear me?

49:32.320 --> 49:33.565
Takumi!

49:37.816 --> 49:38.870
Ah!

50:37.192 --> 50:39.460
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no.

50:39.462 --> 50:41.698
No, no, no, no.

50:45.183 --> 50:46.300
No!

50:50.902 --> 50:52.211
No!

50:55.377 --> 50:57.867
Ah, come here.
It's me. It's me.

50:57.869 --> 51:02.502
Breathe, breathe.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

51:02.504 --> 51:03.588
Ah.

51:05.220 --> 51:06.337
Tent.

51:07.424 --> 51:09.053
A tent.

52:40.900 --> 52:42.815
Hel-help.

52:42.817 --> 52:44.540
Help. We need help.

52:50.709 --> 52:53.073
Say-say-say we need help.
Say we need help.

53:19.726 --> 53:22.058
Hands, hands, hands, hands.

53:37.155 --> 53:38.848
You still have time to eat.

53:39.807 --> 53:42.172
Doc said 12 hours
before cutoff.

53:47.030 --> 53:49.042
I don't think I'm hungry.

53:49.044 --> 53:50.321
It's all right.

53:52.079 --> 53:55.786
I guess I'm gonna have to
eat this all by myself, huh?

54:04.287 --> 54:05.500
What are you?

54:11.477 --> 54:12.658
Afraid.

54:16.846 --> 54:18.443
Well you... you should be.

54:19.243 --> 54:20.744
Your chair's broken.

54:22.279 --> 54:23.780
Yeah, well why not add

54:23.782 --> 54:25.857
falling off a chair
to the list?

54:30.843 --> 54:32.535
I don't wanna die, Arthur.

54:35.477 --> 54:36.882
Listen to me.

54:37.554 --> 54:38.639
Mm-mmh.

54:39.152 --> 54:40.685
You're not gonna die.

54:42.795 --> 54:43.913
You're not.

54:45.767 --> 54:48.866
It's not-it's not the thought
of dying that scares me.

54:48.868 --> 54:51.678
It's the thought of
dying there, at a hospital.

54:51.680 --> 54:53.117
In some...

54:53.980 --> 54:56.312
...cold, empty room
surrounded by people

54:56.314 --> 54:58.869
who are only there
because it's their job to be.

55:02.449 --> 55:04.046
I'll see if I can...

55:04.781 --> 55:06.442
...stay in the operating room.

55:12.962 --> 55:14.527
I don't think
they let people do that.

55:14.529 --> 55:17.308
I don't think they do either,
but I'll try.

55:34.821 --> 55:36.897
Promise me something, Arthur.

55:38.336 --> 55:40.668
Promise me that
whenever it's your time...

55:42.778 --> 55:45.206
...promise me it won't be
in a place like that.

55:50.768 --> 55:51.981
Okay.

55:52.909 --> 55:54.346
I'm serious.

55:56.936 --> 56:00.929
Just promise me it'll be
the perfect place.

56:02.145 --> 56:03.741
You make it sound
like I'm gonna know

56:03.743 --> 56:06.233
when that time is.
- Yeah, I think you will.

56:09.590 --> 56:11.731
I think deep down
we all do.

56:16.493 --> 56:17.802
Please?

56:24.067 --> 56:25.345
Okay.

56:26.975 --> 56:28.348
I promise.

56:30.938 --> 56:32.279
I promise.

58:00.956 --> 58:02.617
You must know by now

58:02.619 --> 58:05.749
this forest,
it is very powerful.

58:05.751 --> 58:08.817
Uh-huh.
I know it's very cold.

58:08.819 --> 58:10.383
Have you tried his compass?

58:17.957 --> 58:20.225
Where are you, compass?

58:31.367 --> 58:32.645
Doesn't work.

58:33.636 --> 58:34.849
Must be the volcanic rock.

58:34.851 --> 58:37.438
The high iron deposits
are throwing it off.

58:37.440 --> 58:38.908
There's more than that.

58:44.597 --> 58:47.504
You make it sound like this
forest is keeping us here.

58:47.506 --> 58:49.390
It seems to have a reason.

58:49.392 --> 58:51.819
Just as it did
for bringing us here.

58:53.568 --> 58:56.697
Okay, so why do you think
he brought all his things?

58:56.699 --> 58:58.392
As I said before...

58:58.394 --> 59:01.236
...some people are sure
when they come,

59:01.238 --> 59:02.610
others are not.

59:03.409 --> 59:05.390
You think he was unsure?

59:05.392 --> 59:07.659
And then I think he got lost.

59:08.523 --> 59:10.408
That happens often, too.

59:12.709 --> 59:14.434
The ribbons.

59:14.436 --> 59:15.617
Ribbons?

59:16.672 --> 59:20.026
Yeah, the ribbons.
There was the-the strings...

59:20.028 --> 59:23.158
...tied up between the trees.
I saw them on the way in.

59:25.108 --> 59:29.582
They help people
find their way back, like...

59:29.584 --> 59:30.828
...bread crumbs.

59:31.501 --> 59:33.865
I wonder if one of
those ribbons were his.

59:33.867 --> 59:35.846
I wonder if any are yours.

59:38.976 --> 59:41.628
I used actual bread crumbs.

59:43.035 --> 59:44.631
You are handsome.

59:45.911 --> 59:47.380
Pardon?

59:47.382 --> 59:49.169
You used bread crumbs.

59:49.171 --> 59:51.022
Handsome and gretel.

59:53.997 --> 59:55.337
What?

59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.208
Hansel and gretel.

01:00:08.632 --> 01:00:10.581
Had me worried there
for a second.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.429
The sky is darker.

01:00:19.529 --> 01:00:21.254
I thought just the opposite.

01:00:23.428 --> 01:00:24.801
Is it morning yet?

01:00:30.459 --> 01:00:31.737
It's ten after three.

01:00:38.512 --> 01:00:39.534
What?

01:00:40.046 --> 01:00:41.835
Does she know you are here?

01:00:44.232 --> 01:00:45.286
Who?

01:00:46.235 --> 01:00:47.240
Who you talkin' about?

01:00:47.265 --> 01:00:48.957
She's why you are here.

01:00:53.803 --> 01:00:55.143
What is your name?

01:00:56.336 --> 01:00:57.485
Arthur.

01:00:58.998 --> 01:01:00.626
What was her name?

01:01:04.832 --> 01:01:05.982
Joan.

01:01:07.203 --> 01:01:08.544
Joan...

01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:10.973
When did she--
- two weeks ago.

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:15.735
You must have had...
Very nice marriage with her.

01:01:18.964 --> 01:01:20.305
No.

01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:22.087
Was it always bad?

01:01:26.698 --> 01:01:27.974
No.

01:01:29.222 --> 01:01:32.225
No, we had a lot
of really great years.

01:01:32.227 --> 01:01:33.599
A lot of 'em.

01:01:33.734 --> 01:01:35.108
What changed?

01:01:43.515 --> 01:01:44.665
We did.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.249
She was an alcoholic.

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:52.244
A functioning alcoholic,
which supposedly made it...

01:01:52.246 --> 01:01:53.937
...okay, but she was...

01:01:58.504 --> 01:02:00.581
...she was horrible
to me sometimes.

01:02:05.071 --> 01:02:06.636
I was even worse to her.

01:02:14.976 --> 01:02:17.372
A few years ago
i had an affair...

01:02:18.843 --> 01:02:21.335
...with a coworker
from a research lab,

01:02:21.336 --> 01:02:23.636
but i-i didn't tell her.

01:02:26.865 --> 01:02:28.525
She found out on her own.

01:02:29.389 --> 01:02:30.794
Which-which...

01:02:31.466 --> 01:02:33.862
Which made it worse,
i think.

01:02:39.775 --> 01:02:41.756
Things went downhill
from there.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:45.526
She-she...
She started drinking more.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.378
The more she despised me,
the more she...

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.817
...hated herself.

01:02:58.981 --> 01:03:00.674
I gave her a reason to drink.

01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:03.326
I was her excuse to drink.

01:03:06.043 --> 01:03:08.600
We almost got divorced...
Twice.

01:03:13.394 --> 01:03:15.246
She never trusted me again.

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:23.651
I can't blame her
'cause I didn't let her.

01:03:24.515 --> 01:03:25.920
Did you love her?

01:03:26.944 --> 01:03:28.828
No, it...

01:03:30.906 --> 01:03:33.142
...it was just
a meaningless fling.

01:03:33.144 --> 01:03:34.644
I meant your wife.

01:03:38.161 --> 01:03:39.949
More than anything on earth.

01:03:40.813 --> 01:03:44.039
So... why do that to her?

01:03:47.301 --> 01:03:49.192
I... I don't know.
I just did.

01:03:49.217 --> 01:03:50.749
I mean...

01:03:50.774 --> 01:03:52.444
It wasn't something
i thought about.
I just did it.

01:03:53.688 --> 01:03:55.507
Sometimes you do things.

01:03:55.532 --> 01:03:57.608
As much as you'd wanna
take 'em back...

01:03:58.016 --> 01:03:59.198
...you can't.

01:04:00.497 --> 01:04:01.870
After that...

01:04:01.895 --> 01:04:04.921
...we pretty much started
keeping our feelings
for each other...

01:04:04.946 --> 01:04:06.255
...a secret.

01:04:06.937 --> 01:04:09.525
Like, I would fix things
for her, but...

01:04:10.453 --> 01:04:12.018
...you know, only in
the middle of the night

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:14.127
when she was asleep,
or when...

01:04:14.129 --> 01:04:15.437
...she was out.

01:04:16.428 --> 01:04:18.696
Like, I'd buy her
a box of tea...

01:04:18.698 --> 01:04:19.815
...a new one...

01:04:21.317 --> 01:04:22.818
...and I'd wait until...

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.608
...the old package
wasn't too full

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:27.165
or too empty
before refilling it.

01:04:27.166 --> 01:04:29.849
That way she wouldn't know...

01:04:34.421 --> 01:04:35.857
And that way
she wouldn't have to...

01:04:35.859 --> 01:04:37.806
...choose whether or not
to thank me.

01:04:40.907 --> 01:04:42.248
Hmm.

01:04:43.464 --> 01:04:44.869
Then she, uh...

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.352
I found my shirts...

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.155
...cleaned and pressed
in the back of my closet,

01:04:52.157 --> 01:04:54.648
only i-i-i hadn't washed 'em.

01:04:57.365 --> 01:04:59.346
She purposefully put 'em
way in the back

01:04:59.348 --> 01:05:01.422
so, by the time
that I got to 'em...

01:05:03.182 --> 01:05:05.098
...I'd forget they were dirty
in the first place

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.782
and I wouldn't have to choose
whether or not...

01:05:09.924 --> 01:05:12.032
...to tell her
i appreciated her.

01:05:15.229 --> 01:05:17.273
This little game we had.

01:05:19.287 --> 01:05:22.291
No consequences.
No "thank yous."

01:05:24.305 --> 01:05:26.413
It was a game,
but it was all we had.

01:05:36.353 --> 01:05:37.854
Then she got sick...

01:05:41.587 --> 01:05:43.439
...and all the anger,
and the pretending,

01:05:43.464 --> 01:05:45.540
and the fighting,
it all-it all...

01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:48.259
...it all got put on hold.

01:05:56.525 --> 01:05:59.048
It's always that moment.
You know?

01:06:01.245 --> 01:06:03.256
Life-changing moment that...

01:06:05.287 --> 01:06:06.659
...knocks us on the floor

01:06:06.661 --> 01:06:08.673
and reminds us
what really matters.

01:06:11.006 --> 01:06:13.338
The thing about those moments
is they come and they go

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.064
and sometimes they...

01:06:20.186 --> 01:06:21.584
...they come too late.

01:06:24.524 --> 01:06:25.802
Too late.

01:06:29.862 --> 01:06:32.257
I didn't come here
because of the loss.

01:06:35.646 --> 01:06:37.818
I didn't come here
because of the grief.

01:06:42.026 --> 01:06:43.932
I came here 
because of the guilt.

01:06:49.528 --> 01:06:52.020
I was wrong to treat my wife
the way I treated her

01:06:52.022 --> 01:06:54.512
and she was wrong to treat me
how she did.

01:06:59.079 --> 01:07:01.334
Now neither one of us are ever
gonna get the chance to say...

01:07:01.359 --> 01:07:02.668
...I'm sorry.

01:07:03.873 --> 01:07:04.947
She's listening.

01:07:04.985 --> 01:07:06.599
No she's not.she's gone

01:07:06.624 --> 01:07:08.140
It is during our darkest times

01:07:08.297 --> 01:07:10.375
that our loved ones
are closest.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.475
Even those who have passed.

01:07:13.057 --> 01:07:14.750
Her spirit...

01:07:14.752 --> 01:07:16.124
No, it's not.

01:07:16.422 --> 01:07:17.572
She's still with you.

01:07:20.891 --> 01:07:23.479
This forest holds her for you.

01:07:24.385 --> 01:07:25.790
It is true.

01:07:28.827 --> 01:07:29.881
I'm sorry.

01:07:34.094 --> 01:07:35.339
Please...

01:07:36.937 --> 01:07:38.769
No, I'm sorry.

01:07:38.794 --> 01:07:41.382
I'm sor--
I'm sorry.

01:07:45.319 --> 01:07:46.948
I'm sorry.

01:07:48.199 --> 01:07:49.988
I'm sorry.

01:07:52.585 --> 01:07:54.645
I'm sorry.

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:57.513
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:08:20.535 --> 01:08:23.027
I don't know if I can live
without her.

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:27.548
You do not have to...

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:29.259
...forever.

01:09:13.613 --> 01:09:15.018
Been on vacation?

01:09:16.904 --> 01:09:18.054
No.

01:09:18.055 --> 01:09:19.970
Well, your box has been full
all week.

01:09:24.636 --> 01:09:26.298
I haven't emptied it yet.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.536
Right, right.
That's what I'm sayin'.

01:09:29.654 --> 01:09:31.028
Anyway.

01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:23.101
Help. Help.
Is anybody there?

01:11:23.103 --> 01:11:24.284
Please.
We need help.

01:11:33.552 --> 01:11:35.820
Takumi.
Get up, takumi.

01:11:35.822 --> 01:11:37.482
Hey, wake up.
Wake up.

01:11:37.484 --> 01:11:39.751
There's no fire.
No more fire.

01:11:39.753 --> 01:11:41.668
No more fire.
We have to go.

01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:43.202
Up. Up.

01:11:43.842 --> 01:11:45.567
Hey, come on.
Come on.

01:11:45.569 --> 01:11:48.060
We have to go.

01:11:54.197 --> 01:11:55.826
I can't carry you.
Can you walk?

01:11:55.828 --> 01:11:57.263
You should go.

01:11:58.927 --> 01:12:00.907
Hey, okay, listen.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.304
I'm coming back.
Okay?

01:12:03.306 --> 01:12:04.933
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna get help.

01:12:04.935 --> 01:12:06.787
I swear I'm coming back
to get you.

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:08.608
Okay? Okay?

01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:12.091
Thank you...

01:12:13.851 --> 01:12:15.383
...for taking care of me.

01:12:15.385 --> 01:12:17.109
Hey, hey.

01:12:17.111 --> 01:12:18.835
I'll be back.
I'll be back.

01:12:21.872 --> 01:12:22.989
Lay down.

01:12:25.482 --> 01:12:27.910
I'll be back.
I promise.

01:12:27.912 --> 01:12:29.764
Okay?
I promise.

01:12:36.156 --> 01:12:38.425
I'll be back.
I'll be back.

01:12:44.912 --> 01:12:46.190
I'll be back.

01:13:07.602 --> 01:13:09.614
Hello. Hello.

01:13:09.616 --> 01:13:11.947
Hello. Are you there?
We need help.

01:13:11.949 --> 01:13:13.769
Please, send an ambulance.

01:13:18.372 --> 01:13:19.457
Shit.

01:14:18.515 --> 01:14:20.400
Yeah? Huh.

01:15:00.794 --> 01:15:03.062
Oh, remember this hat?

01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:07.248
- Where is that?
- I have no idea.

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:09.741
What was this?
Like '90... '98? '99?

01:15:10.861 --> 01:15:11.882
Oh.

01:15:11.884 --> 01:15:15.685
Yeah, it must've been, 'cause
there's the old north lab logo,

01:15:15.687 --> 01:15:17.826
and they changed it
at the turn of the millennium.

01:15:20.735 --> 01:15:21.980
Sorry.

01:15:26.009 --> 01:15:27.670
It's okay.

01:15:27.672 --> 01:15:28.947
Stop.

01:15:30.418 --> 01:15:34.157
Uh, okay, there we are
at the lake house.

01:15:34.158 --> 01:15:35.818
I loved that lake.

01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:35.818
Yeah, you did.

01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:39.142
Just being near the water.

01:15:39.144 --> 01:15:40.932
It's my paradise.

01:15:40.934 --> 01:15:43.041
You know what your favorite
thing to do was?

01:15:43.043 --> 01:15:44.575
At least from my eye,
you used to love

01:15:44.577 --> 01:15:46.620
to go down there and walk.

01:15:46.622 --> 01:15:47.674
Those orchids.

01:15:48.314 --> 01:15:49.528
You'd be down there for hours,

01:15:49.529 --> 01:15:52.052
then you'd walk
back up the stairs

01:15:52.054 --> 01:15:54.545
and you'd line 'em up
right across that windowsill.

01:15:54.547 --> 01:15:56.431
You remember that.

01:15:57.805 --> 01:15:59.466
Of course I do.

01:16:01.929 --> 01:16:04.037
We can go back there
whenever you want to.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.145
Okay.

01:16:07.968 --> 01:16:09.053
Hey...

01:16:12.922 --> 01:16:15.125
You made it past
the first step, okay?

01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:17.937
You already crossed
the first hurled and that's...

01:16:17.939 --> 01:16:19.792
...that's a good sign.

01:16:20.814 --> 01:16:22.572
I'm just nervous.

01:16:23.755 --> 01:16:27.269
I don't know.
I've been so angry.

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:30.880
So many things.

01:16:37.497 --> 01:16:38.870
Listen.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:42.545
Let's both get
one of those hats.

01:16:42.547 --> 01:16:44.207
Both of us.

01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:45.453
Okay?

01:16:46.348 --> 01:16:48.616
What if I want a frilly hat?

01:16:48.618 --> 01:16:50.789
Well then, I guess I'm gonna
have to wear a frilly hat.

01:16:50.791 --> 01:16:52.484
You can't wear a--

01:16:52.485 --> 01:16:54.017
I can pull off
a frilly hat.

01:16:54.019 --> 01:16:55.455
You don't think
i could pull off a frilly hat?

01:16:55.457 --> 01:16:58.236
- You'll look like a girl.
- I don't care.

01:16:58.238 --> 01:17:00.792
I can handle frilly
and feathers.

01:17:00.794 --> 01:17:02.358
Go for it.

01:17:03.573 --> 01:17:05.043
Hey.
- Hey.

01:17:07.153 --> 01:17:10.443
We finally received the results
from the tests,

01:17:10.445 --> 01:17:11.881
and...

01:17:11.883 --> 01:17:14.182
...the mass was non-malignant.

01:17:31.728 --> 01:17:32.973
How are you feeling?

01:17:33.869 --> 01:17:37.606
Um, after that
i feel pretty great.

01:17:37.608 --> 01:17:39.876
You dealing with the pain okay?

01:17:39.878 --> 01:17:41.634
Yeah, it's...

01:17:41.635 --> 01:17:43.647
...just a little sore here.

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:46.554
It's gonna sting a little.

01:17:46.556 --> 01:17:47.673
So...

01:17:47.675 --> 01:17:49.207
...the plan is still
to transport you

01:17:49.209 --> 01:17:51.476
over to the recovery unit
at St. Mary's.

01:17:57.644 --> 01:17:58.986
Thank you.

01:18:09.373 --> 01:18:11.737
Listen, okay?
Listen.

01:18:11.739 --> 01:18:13.238
Have this on you.

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.517
I'll call you on the way

01:18:14.519 --> 01:18:17.202
so you have some company,
okay?

01:18:17.204 --> 01:18:18.895
It's okay if she has the phone
in there, right?

01:18:18.897 --> 01:18:20.174
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

01:18:20.175 --> 01:18:21.611
You got the car?

01:18:21.613 --> 01:18:23.081
Right behind you, baby.

01:18:23.945 --> 01:18:25.031
Okay.

01:18:25.607 --> 01:18:26.693
Call me.

01:18:26.695 --> 01:18:30.272
I hope to even text you
inappropriate photos

01:18:30.274 --> 01:18:33.755
while I'm driving
tonight!

01:18:33.757 --> 01:18:35.097
Tonight!

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:36.887
You're crazy.

01:18:36.889 --> 01:18:39.124
Cheeseburger, Margarita,
little dancing.

01:18:42.609 --> 01:18:44.206
<i> Are you there?</i>

01:18:44.207 --> 01:18:45.867
Mm-hmm.

01:18:45.869 --> 01:18:47.816
<i> - Hi.</i>
- Are you cozy?

01:18:47.818 --> 01:18:49.734
Are you cozy up there?

01:18:49.736 --> 01:18:52.610
<i> - Yeah.</i>
- I am right behind you, baby.

01:18:52.612 --> 01:18:55.997
<i> - I can see you.</i>
- You can see me?

01:18:55.999 --> 01:18:58.458
<i> Through those dark</i>
<i> tinted windows?</i>

01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:00.408
Yeah, I can see a little bit.

01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:02.388
<i> Oh, wave.</i>
<i> Can you wave?</i>

01:19:04.275 --> 01:19:05.712
<i> You can't see me,</i>
<i> I'm sure.</i>

01:19:05.714 --> 01:19:08.109
No, I don't.
I don't see you.

01:19:10.028 --> 01:19:12.583
My god, it's weird.

01:19:12.585 --> 01:19:14.213
It's bumpy in here.

01:19:14.215 --> 01:19:16.769
You've never ridden in the back
of an ambulance before?

01:19:16.771 --> 01:19:19.358
<i> No, actually.</i>

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:20.541
Not even as a kid?

01:19:22.044 --> 01:19:23.800
No, never.

01:19:25.367 --> 01:19:27.348
Why is that so hard to believe?

01:19:28.882 --> 01:19:30.287
<i> It's not hard to believe</i>
<i> that you've never</i>

01:19:30.289 --> 01:19:31.534
<i> been in the back</i>
<i> of an ambulance before.</i>

01:19:31.536 --> 01:19:34.122
<i> It's just hard to believe</i>
<i> that I had no idea...</i>

01:19:34.124 --> 01:19:36.615
...that you've never been in the
back of an ambulance before.

01:19:38.086 --> 01:19:41.568
Well, I'm sure there's things
about you I don't know.

01:19:43.328 --> 01:19:45.019
<i> You know,</i>
<i> I somehow doubt that.</i>

01:19:47.737 --> 01:19:48.950
Okay.

01:19:51.508 --> 01:19:53.264
What's your favorite color?

01:19:53.937 --> 01:19:55.438
Oh, now you're messing with me.

01:19:55.439 --> 01:19:57.578
Like you don't know
my favorite color?

01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:58.857
Huh?

01:19:58.859 --> 01:20:00.358
What's mine?

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.276
<i> Your favorite color is...</i>

01:20:02.278 --> 01:20:03.554
<i> ...um...</i>

01:20:03.556 --> 01:20:05.696
You got me.
Hi, my name is Arthur.

01:20:05.698 --> 01:20:07.901
Um, nice to meet you.

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:09.882
Who is this beautiful person--

01:20:13.558 --> 01:20:14.867
Joan!

01:20:20.206 --> 01:20:21.450
Joan!

01:20:25.223 --> 01:20:26.499
Joan!

01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:03.474
I hear you.
I hear you.

01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:11.144
I read you.
I'm here.

01:21:23.064 --> 01:21:26.099
Stairway, stairway, s...

01:21:26.101 --> 01:21:27.634
Stairway...

01:21:32.666 --> 01:21:34.551
Stairway, stairway...

01:21:35.665 --> 01:21:37.806
<i> Rakuen kaidan...</i>

01:21:39.307 --> 01:21:41.159
<i> K-kaidan...</i>

01:21:42.495 --> 01:21:43.770
<i> Kaidan.</i>

01:24:51.433 --> 01:24:52.998
Hey...

01:24:54.372 --> 01:24:56.161
Ha...

01:25:09.553 --> 01:25:11.436
Sir? Sir?

01:25:11.438 --> 01:25:12.971
Are you okay, sir?

01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:23.101
Yeh... yeh... yeh...

01:25:23.103 --> 01:25:24.667
You have to get him.

01:25:25.627 --> 01:25:28.822
He... he... he's still in there.

01:25:28.824 --> 01:25:31.026
He... he's still in there.

01:25:38.154 --> 01:25:39.782
He's still in there.

01:25:50.969 --> 01:25:52.214
He...

01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:57.646
He's still in there.

01:26:33.153 --> 01:26:34.621
Mr. Brennan?

01:26:35.325 --> 01:26:36.474
Sir?

01:26:37.913 --> 01:26:39.766
We're locking up
for the evening.

01:26:39.768 --> 01:26:41.108
I'm sorry.

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.851
Can I get another minute?

01:26:47.853 --> 01:26:49.258
Of course.

01:26:53.445 --> 01:26:55.297
It was very well attended.

01:26:56.768 --> 01:26:59.388
She obviously was very loved.

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:08.751
I didn't know her.

01:27:09.710 --> 01:27:11.052
I'm sorry?

01:27:12.747 --> 01:27:14.056
My wife.

01:27:21.279 --> 01:27:22.876
I didn't really know her.

01:27:27.799 --> 01:27:30.131
I mean, i-i-i knew...

01:27:30.133 --> 01:27:34.349
...you know, the date
her car insurance
needed to be renewed...

01:27:34.351 --> 01:27:36.393
...and her
social security number...

01:27:40.996 --> 01:27:43.137
Thing-things
that seemed important.

01:27:46.174 --> 01:27:48.250
I didn't know her favorite...

01:27:49.561 --> 01:27:51.318
...her favorite color.

01:27:54.258 --> 01:27:56.143
I don't know
her favorite season.

01:27:59.308 --> 01:28:01.097
I don't know her favorite book.

01:28:03.079 --> 01:28:05.027
It was a children's story.

01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:09.310
I overheard her sisters
talking about it earlier.

01:28:09.311 --> 01:28:12.122
Apparently one of them
ordered it for her recently.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:16.180
No mention of a favorite color
or season, though.

01:28:16.182 --> 01:28:17.491
I'm sorry.

01:28:20.688 --> 01:28:22.093
Take your time, sir.

01:28:46.797 --> 01:28:48.745
We do play baseball, you know.

01:28:51.942 --> 01:28:54.177
Yes.
This is more entertaining.

01:28:54.179 --> 01:28:55.615
If you say so.

01:28:55.617 --> 01:28:56.958
Let me take a look.

01:29:02.246 --> 01:29:03.778
It's healing nicely.

01:29:04.707 --> 01:29:06.112
How are you feeling?

01:29:07.071 --> 01:29:08.253
Better.

01:29:08.701 --> 01:29:10.011
Better is good.

01:29:10.012 --> 01:29:11.352
Better is very good.

01:29:11.354 --> 01:29:12.375
Glasses.

01:29:14.932 --> 01:29:16.530
Look at my finger.

01:29:17.490 --> 01:29:18.543
It's bright.

01:29:18.545 --> 01:29:20.908
It's a light shining
right in your eyeball.

01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:22.665
It should be.

01:29:22.667 --> 01:29:23.751
Good.

01:29:24.775 --> 01:29:26.596
Don't tell me
you're playing along.

01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:31.709
No, this is s-
this is something else.

01:29:33.244 --> 01:29:35.512
Channel five.
It's the seventh inning.

01:29:52.418 --> 01:29:54.559
Why did you go to aokigahara?

01:29:55.454 --> 01:29:56.732
It wasn't working.

01:29:56.734 --> 01:29:57.946
What wasn't?

01:29:59.225 --> 01:30:00.342
Moving on.

01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:03.314
Do you still want
to end your life?

01:30:05.457 --> 01:30:06.479
No.

01:30:06.481 --> 01:30:10.154
What do you plan to do
after you leave the hospital?

01:30:10.156 --> 01:30:11.560
Go back to the forest.

01:30:13.478 --> 01:30:16.673
I made a promise to someone
and I'm going to keep it.

01:30:16.675 --> 01:30:19.708
You are speaking of the other
person who was with you?

01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:20.987
I have to find him.

01:30:21.659 --> 01:30:23.192
As I understand it,

01:30:23.194 --> 01:30:25.109
the park rangers already tried.

01:30:26.324 --> 01:30:30.414
It's a... it's a big forest.
Trust me.

01:30:30.416 --> 01:30:32.268
There's a video camera
in the parking lot.

01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:33.450
I know.
I saw it.

01:30:33.452 --> 01:30:36.550
And it saw you on the day
you entered the forest.

01:30:36.552 --> 01:30:37.988
The rangers
reviewed the footage

01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:40.321
from the day
you say he entered.

01:30:40.323 --> 01:30:42.877
No one entered aokigahara
that day.

01:30:42.879 --> 01:30:44.092
Look.

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:47.319
I was there with someone.

01:30:47.321 --> 01:30:48.918
I mean, I don't know...

01:30:49.877 --> 01:30:52.848
...which particular way
he entered the forest.

01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:55.341
I don't know what particular
day he got there.

01:30:55.342 --> 01:30:58.345
I do know that when I left him
he was dying.

01:30:58.347 --> 01:30:59.974
The fact remains,

01:30:59.976 --> 01:31:01.604
without any visual confirmation

01:31:01.606 --> 01:31:03.394
we have no way
of identifying him,

01:31:03.396 --> 01:31:05.823
and therefore, no way
of notifying his family.

01:31:05.825 --> 01:31:07.996
His name was takumi Nakamura.

01:31:07.998 --> 01:31:09.625
There are thousands
with that name.

01:31:09.627 --> 01:31:11.191
He had a family.

01:31:11.193 --> 01:31:14.419
He had a wife named kiiro,

01:31:14.421 --> 01:31:16.049
and a...

01:31:17.143 --> 01:31:19.922
...and a child named fuyu.

01:31:20.268 --> 01:31:22.057
Mr. Brennan, there are not...

01:31:22.059 --> 01:31:23.846
I'm telling you,
all right,

01:31:23.848 --> 01:31:25.316
he's in there somewhere.

01:31:25.318 --> 01:31:26.818
I don't doubt that.

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:29.694
You said the rangers
scouted the forest?

01:31:30.686 --> 01:31:32.570
Did they find a tent?

01:31:32.572 --> 01:31:34.009
I left him
by a tent.

01:31:34.011 --> 01:31:35.255
It's been two weeks.

01:31:35.257 --> 01:31:36.789
- It's been 12 days.
- Still...

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:38.355
Answer my question.

01:31:38.995 --> 01:31:40.560
Did they find a tent?

01:31:42.318 --> 01:31:44.682
There was no sign
of the person you described.

01:35:00.063 --> 01:35:01.404
Takumi!

01:35:37.613 --> 01:35:40.008
<i> Things are not</i>
<i> as they seem here.</i>

01:35:42.598 --> 01:35:45.793
<i> This forest</i>
<i> is what you call purgatory.</i>

01:35:49.341 --> 01:35:51.801
<i> No one entered the forest</i>
<i> that day.</i>

01:35:53.399 --> 01:35:55.731
<i> It is during</i>
<i> our darkest times</i>

01:35:55.733 --> 01:35:58.192
<i> that our loved ones</i>
<i> are closest.</i>

01:35:58.194 --> 01:36:00.492
<i> Even those who have passed.</i>

01:36:04.744 --> 01:36:06.245
<i> Promise me.</i>

01:36:06.246 --> 01:36:08.865
<i> Promise me you'll find</i>
<i> the perfect place.</i>

01:36:11.616 --> 01:36:13.371
<i> It is said a flower grows</i>

01:36:13.373 --> 01:36:16.567
<i> when a soul has crossed over</i>
<i> from this place.</i>

01:36:19.987 --> 01:36:21.041
<i> Did you love her?</i>

01:36:22.161 --> 01:36:24.204
<i> More than anything</i>
<i> on earth.</i>

01:36:26.699 --> 01:36:28.487
<i> She is with you.</i>

01:36:28.488 --> 01:36:30.724
<i> This forest holds her</i>
<i> for you.</i>

01:36:45.842 --> 01:36:48.460
<i> Thank you</i>
<i> for taking care of me.</i>

01:36:53.478 --> 01:36:55.490
<i> I don't know how</i>
<i> to live without her.</i>

01:36:56.706 --> 01:36:58.974
<i> You will not have to.</i>

01:36:58.976 --> 01:37:00.540
<i> Not forever.</i>

01:37:29.668 --> 01:37:30.690
Good morning, sir.

01:37:31.618 --> 01:37:33.790
- Good morning.
- Would you like breakfast?

01:37:33.792 --> 01:37:34.749
Yes, please.

01:37:34.751 --> 01:37:36.506
Cereal or omelette?

01:37:36.508 --> 01:37:38.295
Um... omelette.

01:37:38.297 --> 01:37:39.638
Yes, sir.

01:37:42.387 --> 01:37:43.696
<i> Arigato.</i>

01:38:48.091 --> 01:38:49.368
<i> How can I help you?</i>

01:38:50.359 --> 01:38:53.459
I just didn't understand
this section on, uh, on...

01:38:53.461 --> 01:38:54.801
...column's law.

01:38:54.802 --> 01:38:56.878
It's coulomb's law.
It's a good one.

01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:58.668
Yeah, I didn't think
any of 'em were good.

01:38:58.670 --> 01:39:00.393
No, this one is.
Trust me.

01:39:01.545 --> 01:39:04.260
Coulomb's law is based
on electrostatic forces,
all right,

01:39:04.262 --> 01:39:04.260
and those are very important,
actually,

01:39:04.262 --> 01:39:07.264
some of the most important
thing in all of the universe,

01:39:07.266 --> 01:39:09.565
because...
They keep us together.

01:39:09.567 --> 01:39:11.866
Now the question here is
with electrostatic forces

01:39:11.868 --> 01:39:14.135
of attraction and repulsion.

01:39:14.137 --> 01:39:17.394
They are directly proportional
to what?

01:39:17.396 --> 01:39:18.704
Yellow winter.

01:39:19.185 --> 01:39:20.303
Yellow winter?

01:39:20.783 --> 01:39:22.636
Yeah. Right here...

01:39:23.276 --> 01:39:25.064
...on this little slip of paper.

01:39:25.066 --> 01:39:26.502
You wrote that, right?

01:39:27.398 --> 01:39:28.580
- This?
- Yeah.

01:39:29.059 --> 01:39:30.944
Kiiro. Fuyu.

01:39:30.946 --> 01:39:33.085
Yellow and winter.

01:39:34.589 --> 01:39:35.769
You speak Japanese?

01:39:37.401 --> 01:39:39.189
Yeah, I do.

01:39:39.191 --> 01:39:40.819
Me and my dad were stationed
in okinawa.

01:39:40.821 --> 01:39:42.672
I went to elementary
school there.

01:39:43.504 --> 01:39:44.782
These are not names?

01:39:45.230 --> 01:39:46.444
No.

01:39:46.446 --> 01:39:47.945
No, not really, they're...

01:39:47.947 --> 01:39:49.511
...a color and a season.

01:40:03.606 --> 01:40:04.787
Professor?

01:40:12.393 --> 01:40:16.802
It-it's directly proportional
to the electrical charges,
and it's...

01:40:16.804 --> 01:40:21.053
...inversely proportional
to the square of the distance.
