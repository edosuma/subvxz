00:02.680 --> 00:03.938
<i>Previously on "Bel-Air"...</i>

00:04.038 --> 00:05.096
Man, I'm done taking
handouts, all right?

00:05.196 --> 00:06.294
I need to get back
to who I used to be.

00:06.394 --> 00:07.771
I was being scouted
to play basketball.

00:07.871 --> 00:09.408
<i>And when I came out here,
all of that went quiet.</i>

00:11.026 --> 00:12.563
- My name's Jackie.
- Nice to meet you, Jackie.

00:12.663 --> 00:13.721
I'll give you extra credit

00:13.821 --> 00:14.998
if you write me
a two-page summary.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.196
Thanks, Ms. Hughes.

00:16.296 --> 00:17.713
I wish all my teachers
were like you.

00:17.813 --> 00:18.792
No one even bothers
to show up

00:18.892 --> 00:19.910
for the student town halls

00:20.010 --> 00:21.227
or run for student government

00:21.327 --> 00:23.104
in order
to actually change things.

00:23.204 --> 00:24.461
Keep coming to the meetings.

00:24.561 --> 00:25.859
We'd love to hear
more of your ideas.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.217
Maybe you should try
a different tact

00:27.317 --> 00:28.654
with Will's dad, huh?

00:28.754 --> 00:30.171
Just do what I asked.

00:30.271 --> 00:31.449
Doesn't sit right with me.

00:31.549 --> 00:32.886
Too bad.

00:32.986 --> 00:34.204
You work for me.

00:34.304 --> 00:36.320
My magazine article
just posted.

00:36.420 --> 00:38.876
It's all about Reid
and his vision.

00:38.976 --> 00:40.832
But you better believe his ass
will be hearing from me.

00:40.932 --> 00:43.188
I expected Ivy and I
to be a team.

00:43.288 --> 00:44.386
That's why you gotta
set the tone.

00:44.486 --> 00:45.704
'Cause if you don't,
she's just gonna

00:45.804 --> 00:47.141
<i>keep on walking
and walking all over you.</i>

00:47.241 --> 00:49.936
Jazz isn't single, okay?
We're dating.

00:50.036 --> 00:51.613
You put your trust in me,
and I let you down.

00:51.713 --> 00:53.330
I'm sorry.

00:53.430 --> 00:54.767
If you're ready to come home,
I promise you

00:54.867 --> 00:56.045
we can figure it
all out together.

00:56.145 --> 00:57.562
I love you, Will.

00:57.662 --> 00:59.200
I love you too, Uncle Phil.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.717
You impressed me today, kid.

01:00.817 --> 01:02.813

01:23.177 --> 01:25.113
Hustle in, guys.
Come on, bring it in.

01:25.213 --> 01:27.669
Here we go. Let's go, fellas.

01:27.769 --> 01:29.226
Will, when you drew
the double team,

01:29.326 --> 01:30.863
Kirk was wide open.
- No, I had the lane.

01:30.963 --> 01:32.540
Look, Tyler just should've
set a screen in the centre.

01:32.640 --> 01:33.938
- You're forcing it.
- No, I'm hot.

01:34.038 --> 01:35.455
Look, kick it to me again,
I'll knock it down.

01:35.555 --> 01:37.132
Listen up.
Here's the play, all right?

01:37.232 --> 01:38.889
Tyler, you're gonna
inbound the ball to Will here.

01:38.989 --> 01:40.286
Will, bring it up the middle.

01:40.386 --> 01:41.684
When the double team comes,
you kick it out

01:41.784 --> 01:42.962
to Kirk for the shot.
- To Kirk?

01:43.062 --> 01:44.239
Come on. I'm right here, man.

01:44.339 --> 01:45.437
Look, no offence,
but we're trying to win.

01:45.537 --> 01:46.875
I got the touch.
- Look, you had the touch.

01:46.975 --> 01:48.232
They're all over you now,

01:48.332 --> 01:49.749
so we're gonna run the plays
that I call.

01:49.849 --> 01:51.307
- Yo, I can win this for us.
- It's not about you, Will.

01:51.407 --> 01:52.385
It's about the team.

01:52.485 --> 01:53.503
I know,
but I'm telling you...

01:53.603 --> 01:55.060
crowd: Let's go, Bulldogs!

01:55.160 --> 01:56.537
I see the West Philly's
coming out of him.

01:56.637 --> 01:58.973
Yeah, I'd love to know
what's going on.

01:59.073 --> 02:02.127
Well, I can tell you
who can fill you in on that.

02:02.227 --> 02:05.322
crowd: Let's go, Bulldogs,
let's go!

02:08.177 --> 02:10.073
Just go over there
and talk to him.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.750
One, two, three.
all: Win!

02:11.850 --> 02:14.306
I'll shoot him a text,
and we'll talk, soon.

02:14.406 --> 02:16.142
All right, Bulldogs,
let's go.

02:16.242 --> 02:17.740
There it is, Will.
Run the play!

02:20.195 --> 02:22.331
There he is. There he is.
There he is.

02:33.052 --> 02:34.669
Yo, run it, run it,
run the play!

02:34.769 --> 02:36.506
- Hey, Will, I'm open!
- There he is! There he is!

02:40.160 --> 02:41.577
Come on, Kirk.

02:44.911 --> 02:46.848
crowd: Oh!

02:46.948 --> 02:48.964
Yeah! Let's get it!

02:49.064 --> 02:51.440
Fuck!

02:53.576 --> 02:55.313
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Hey, defence!

02:55.413 --> 02:57.589
Yo, yo!

02:57.689 --> 02:59.685
Come on, fellas, line up.

03:04.197 --> 03:05.814
Let's line up.
- Yo, yo!

03:05.914 --> 03:07.691
- Will!
- Yo, Doc.

03:07.791 --> 03:09.128
Doc!
- Yo, Will!

03:09.228 --> 03:11.444
Yo, I appreciate you
for coming.

03:11.544 --> 03:13.081
No problem.

03:13.181 --> 03:14.838
You know, uh,
Coach called that last play

03:14.938 --> 03:16.096
'cause I was getting
double-teamed the whole game,

03:16.096 --> 03:17.393
but you saw I was
busting they ass.

03:17.493 --> 03:18.791
Yeah.

03:18.891 --> 03:20.667
Until the game was on the line.

03:20.767 --> 03:23.023
Your team lost.

03:23.123 --> 03:24.261
The coach calls plays.

03:24.361 --> 03:27.216
D-I scouts looking
for gamers, Will.

03:27.316 --> 03:29.572
And the pros, shit,
they looking for people

03:29.672 --> 03:32.207
to take over the game
if that's what's necessary.

03:32.307 --> 03:35.341
'Cause in the end, it's always
about getting the W.

03:36.859 --> 03:37.997
Yeah.

03:38.097 --> 03:39.115
Well, you know,
maybe next game if--

03:39.215 --> 03:40.432
Yeah, I'll holler.

03:55.705 --> 03:58.440
Oh, you're going in
to talk him off the ledge?

03:58.540 --> 04:00.676
I'm gonna do my best.

04:00.776 --> 04:04.070
Hey, Dad, look, I know
you and Mum are talking

04:04.170 --> 04:06.985
to Dr. Richardson tomorrow
about lowering my meds,

04:07.085 --> 04:08.702
and I was just wondering
what you were thinking.

04:08.802 --> 04:10.020
Oh, I mean,
your mother and I,

04:10.120 --> 04:11.617
we're still trying
to figure out how we feel,

04:11.717 --> 04:13.294
but we're hoping
that the doctors can

04:13.394 --> 04:14.971
give some clarity on things.

04:15.071 --> 04:17.406
Look, it's just--

04:17.506 --> 04:19.682
it's gotten worse.

04:19.782 --> 04:21.399
How so?

04:21.499 --> 04:23.356
Well, the meds are
messing with my sleep,

04:23.456 --> 04:25.073
all right,
and so my grades are slipping.

04:25.173 --> 04:26.949
And, you know,
I'm applying for colleges soon

04:27.049 --> 04:28.187
and it's all I can think about,

04:28.287 --> 04:29.585
and so it's like
my anxiety medication

04:29.685 --> 04:31.801
is giving me more anxiety.

04:35.554 --> 04:38.808
Look, your mother
and I are gonna go

04:38.908 --> 04:41.683
into this discussion
with an open mind, all right?

04:41.783 --> 04:44.278
Just like we promised, okay?

04:44.378 --> 04:46.035
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Appreciate it.

04:53.243 --> 04:55.578

04:57.795 --> 05:00.769
Hey. Can I come in?

05:00.869 --> 05:02.866
Sure, Uncle Phil.

05:04.103 --> 05:06.000
I just wanted to see
how you're doing.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.397
Tough game.

05:07.497 --> 05:08.715
Should've won.

05:08.815 --> 05:09.873
Yeah.

05:09.973 --> 05:11.350
I noticed that you
and your coach

05:11.450 --> 05:12.708
were going back and forth
a bit.

05:12.808 --> 05:14.385
Well, he picked Kirk
to take the game-winner.

05:14.485 --> 05:16.661
Excuse my language, but shit.

05:16.761 --> 05:19.256
I bet he wishes
he listened to me now.

05:19.356 --> 05:23.728
Well, I do know
how painful it is to lose.

05:23.828 --> 05:25.086
Believe me.

05:25.186 --> 05:26.523
But I gotta be honest.

05:26.623 --> 05:29.358
You sound pretty arrogant
when you talk like that.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.195
I get that.

05:31.295 --> 05:33.790
But look, in Philly, everybody
knew I put in the work

05:33.890 --> 05:35.787
to be the go-to when the game
was on the line.

05:35.887 --> 05:38.901
But out here, it's like Coach
is ODing on the mind games,

05:39.001 --> 05:41.936
like he's trying to talk me
out my game or something.

05:42.036 --> 05:45.370
The fact is, when I do me,
we win every time.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.326
This new friction
between you and your coach,

05:47.426 --> 05:48.963
would it have anything
to do with that man

05:49.063 --> 05:49.921
you spoke to after the game?

05:50.021 --> 05:51.199
That was Doc.

05:51.299 --> 05:52.277
He's connected
with one of the best

05:52.377 --> 05:54.633
travel teams in the country.

05:54.733 --> 05:56.110
Good dude to impress.

05:56.210 --> 05:58.346
Hmm.

05:58.446 --> 06:00.622
So is that what
you're trying to do,

06:00.722 --> 06:02.819
impress some Rich Paul wannabe

06:02.919 --> 06:05.055
who's not even affiliated
with your school?

06:05.155 --> 06:07.171
Not everything has to be
about Bel-Air, Uncle Phil.

06:07.271 --> 06:08.608
I mean, there's multiple ways
to get

06:08.708 --> 06:10.245
to where I'm trying to go.
- Oh, yeah?

06:10.345 --> 06:12.521
And where's that exactly?

06:12.621 --> 06:14.198
D-I scholarship.

06:14.298 --> 06:15.955
The league.

06:16.055 --> 06:19.109
Well, you know,
there's a lot of other ways

06:19.209 --> 06:20.267
you can get
a scholarship, Will.

06:20.367 --> 06:23.022
I know. I know.

06:23.122 --> 06:24.500
Well, listen.

06:24.600 --> 06:29.211
It's dinnertime, so we can
pick this up later, yeah?

06:29.311 --> 06:30.569
But for now, I'd advise you
to be careful

06:30.669 --> 06:32.046
about who you listen to

06:32.146 --> 06:33.564
and why
they're all in your business

06:33.664 --> 06:35.041
in the first place.

06:38.056 --> 06:41.070

I just don't get it, though.
I don't get it at all.

06:57.940 --> 06:59.997
It's like--like,
Coach is always telling me

07:00.097 --> 07:01.514
I need to step up
and be a leader.

07:01.614 --> 07:03.430
But in the clutch,
a leader takes over.

07:03.530 --> 07:05.507
Yeah, well, maybe Coach just
wants you to be a leader

07:05.607 --> 07:07.304
that elevates the entire team.

07:07.404 --> 07:09.140
That's the point
that I don't get, bro.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.015
It's like, don't I elevate
the entire team by winning?

07:12.115 --> 07:13.473
Plus, I'm the best-looking dude
out there on the court.

07:13.473 --> 07:14.770
Shit, I'm double elevating.

07:14.870 --> 07:16.128
I need a whole massage

07:16.228 --> 07:17.765
carrying this team
on my back, bro.

07:17.865 --> 07:20.360
Ah, you must've smoked some
good-ass weed at Jazz's, huh?

07:20.460 --> 07:21.718
Look, just talk to Coach.

07:21.818 --> 07:22.956
Let him know how you feel.

07:23.056 --> 07:24.473
Hey, Will.

07:24.573 --> 07:26.549
Carlton, I'll see you
at BSU tomorrow, right?

07:26.649 --> 07:29.983
Uh, right.
Yeah, absolutely, with ideas.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.080
Okay.

07:34.076 --> 07:35.014
You got some ideas
for the BSU?

07:35.114 --> 07:36.372
Nope, absolutely not.

07:36.472 --> 07:38.009
I'm sure
I'll figure something out.

07:38.109 --> 07:40.644
Yeah, after the big game you
talked last time, you better.

07:40.744 --> 07:42.042
You're not helping, Will.

07:42.142 --> 07:44.358
I gotta go.
- Deuce.

07:44.458 --> 07:45.635
both:
Yerp.

07:45.735 --> 07:48.670
Most of you
summarised the plot,

07:48.770 --> 07:51.185
but your papers
need to go deeper.

07:51.285 --> 07:53.282
Come on.

07:53.761 --> 07:56.216
Do not be timid.

07:56.316 --> 07:58.013
Yes, Olivia?

07:58.113 --> 08:00.409
How do I do that if I didn't
really understand the book?

08:00.509 --> 08:03.883
Well, you write a paper
that argues

08:03.983 --> 08:05.719
that the novel is convoluted.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.734
And then you cite the passages
that confused you.

08:11.130 --> 08:13.026
What do I do
if I think I can write

08:13.126 --> 08:14.344
a better version of the story?

08:16.161 --> 08:17.858
Okay. Okay.

08:17.958 --> 08:21.931
Well, in that case,
I challenge you

08:22.031 --> 08:24.805
to write a short story
and prove it.

08:38.841 --> 08:40.737
I finished
the Robyn Spencer book.

08:40.837 --> 08:42.414
It was amazing.

08:42.514 --> 08:46.048
Yeah, girlfriend was not
afraid to mix it up.

08:46.148 --> 08:48.663
Do you have anything else
along the same lines?

08:50.420 --> 08:51.558
Okay.

08:59.684 --> 09:01.420
"I'm Still Here:

09:33.304 --> 09:34.521
What, were you thinking
you're on stage

09:34.621 --> 09:35.679
or something in your mind?

09:35.779 --> 09:36.957
Girl, you know I love Tupac.

09:37.057 --> 09:39.033
Mm-hmm.

09:39.133 --> 09:40.590
What you doing here?

09:40.690 --> 09:44.304
Well, I wanted
to surprise you...

09:44.404 --> 09:45.861
Okay.

09:45.961 --> 09:48.776
With a Hilary Banks lunch.

09:48.876 --> 09:50.094
Okay. Love those.

09:50.194 --> 09:52.849
This is my fried
tofu-for-you sandwich.

09:52.949 --> 09:54.605
Tastes just like chicken.

09:57.021 --> 09:59.117
Mm-hmm. It's good?

09:59.217 --> 10:00.954
- Mmm...
- Uh-huh. You love it?

10:01.054 --> 10:02.831
Mmm. Okay.

10:02.931 --> 10:05.087
I'm good with this. Mmm.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.056
Um...

10:11.156 --> 10:12.534
so we pregnant or something?

10:12.634 --> 10:13.612
'Cause you're looking
at me crazy.

10:13.712 --> 10:16.127
What? No.

10:16.227 --> 10:19.002
But...
- Mmm.

10:19.102 --> 10:22.556
I was gonna ask you
if I could...

10:22.656 --> 10:23.873
borrow your Impala.

10:23.973 --> 10:25.550
Ha!

10:25.650 --> 10:27.307
Absolutely not, okay?

10:27.407 --> 10:29.463
Ain't no way I'm 'bout
to trade in my mint condition

10:29.563 --> 10:33.177
'64 Impala for what,
a almost chicken sandwich?

10:34.395 --> 10:36.251
Somebody's crazy.

10:36.351 --> 10:38.847
Whatever, whatever.

10:38.947 --> 10:41.602
Babe, listen.

10:41.702 --> 10:44.596
I would be so careful.
So careful.

10:44.696 --> 10:46.753
And I would only need it
for a couple hours.

10:46.853 --> 10:48.549
Okay, let me explain
something to you.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.745
Besides the original owner,

10:50.845 --> 10:52.223
only two people
have ever driven this car.

10:52.323 --> 10:53.540
Do you know who they are?
- No.

10:53.640 --> 10:54.658
Well, let me tell you.

10:54.758 --> 10:56.335
They was both me.

10:56.435 --> 10:58.012
No.

10:58.112 --> 11:00.688
Okay, but what if the third
person is your girlfriend?

11:00.788 --> 11:02.285
What if no?

11:02.385 --> 11:04.800
Listen, me and my girls
are doing a coming-out video

11:04.900 --> 11:06.318
for the rebranded house,

11:06.418 --> 11:09.752
and I would look so cute
behind the wheel of that car.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.737
You will bring it back tonight.

11:17.837 --> 11:19.135
Okay, yes.

11:19.235 --> 11:21.231
You got it.

11:24.186 --> 11:25.484
You're lucky you look good.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.400
Thank you.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.838
I know how important
your car is to you.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.115
I would never
let anything happen--

11:30.215 --> 11:32.192
Okay, okay, just go
before I change my mind.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.288
Thank you.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.927
Let me guess.

11:46.027 --> 11:47.325
You are the mystery person

11:47.425 --> 11:49.680
who got the perfect score
on the calculus test?

11:49.780 --> 11:52.316
- Guilty. How'd you do?
- B-plus.

11:52.416 --> 11:54.612
And I studied so hard
even for that.

11:56.808 --> 11:57.786
You should go for it.

11:57.886 --> 11:59.343
The Founders Award?

11:59.443 --> 12:01.340
Yeah, I'm not so sure it'd be
worth the disappointment.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.775
This is the closest thing
to a guaranteed ticket

12:03.875 --> 12:06.131
to the Ivy League,
so why not try?

12:06.231 --> 12:08.008
Yeah, well, first,
I'd have to get nominated,

12:08.108 --> 12:09.645
and then I'd have to get votes
from the students,

12:09.745 --> 12:11.521
faculty, and alumni.

12:11.621 --> 12:13.119
There's a reason
no Black student has ever won.

12:13.219 --> 12:14.876
So you'd be the first.

12:14.976 --> 12:17.551
Carlton, you got elected
class president.

12:17.651 --> 12:19.946
Yeah, well, a lot has changed
since then, Lis.

12:20.046 --> 12:22.103
Sure,
but I've seen you lately,

12:22.203 --> 12:23.540
and you've been
making an effort.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.177
You've been going to the BSU.

12:25.277 --> 12:27.693
It's not crazy to think
that they'd nominate you

12:27.793 --> 12:29.569
if you stay involved.

12:29.669 --> 12:31.087
Look, why don't you
just go for it?

12:31.187 --> 12:35.000
I'm going to be fourth
legacy generation at Howard.

12:35.100 --> 12:38.553
But you've always wanted
to go to Harvard or Yale.

12:38.653 --> 12:41.388
- Princeton, actually.
- Right. Why that one?

12:41.488 --> 12:44.063
I don't know.
I wanna start a new legacy.

12:52.828 --> 12:54.365
Great hustle today, fellas.

12:54.465 --> 12:56.282
Let's make sure we bring
that same energy tomorrow.

12:59.696 --> 13:00.634
Yo.

13:00.734 --> 13:02.830
Yo, fellas, fellas.

13:02.930 --> 13:04.986
Gotta rap with y'all.

13:05.086 --> 13:06.344
Look, I wanna talk
about what happened

13:06.444 --> 13:08.300
at the end of the game.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.057
I know things got intense
between me and Coach,

13:10.157 --> 13:11.734
but on God, I didn't mean
to offend anybody.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.731
But real talk,

13:13.831 --> 13:15.248
shit, we not even gonna
make it to the playoffs

13:15.348 --> 13:16.805
if we keep playing the way we--

13:16.905 --> 13:18.223
Look, I already apologised
for missing the shot, man.

13:18.223 --> 13:19.680
Can't you just let it go?
- Kirk, this is not about you.

13:19.780 --> 13:21.277
This is about everybody,
the team.

13:21.377 --> 13:23.074
We all need to step up.

13:23.174 --> 13:24.751
On my old team--
shit, on any court in Philly,

13:24.851 --> 13:26.628
if your boy is off his game,
you tell him.

13:26.728 --> 13:28.664
Nobody cries.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.461
You man up and do
what it takes to win.

13:30.561 --> 13:32.417
"Man up"?

13:32.517 --> 13:34.494
Are you fucking kidding me?

13:34.594 --> 13:36.570
I don't give a shit
how they did things in Philly.

13:36.670 --> 13:38.127
We're not your homeys
from the hood, Will.

13:38.227 --> 13:39.545
First of all, you need
to watch your fucking mouth

13:39.545 --> 13:40.483
and put some
respect on my name.

13:40.583 --> 13:41.761
All right, hey, stop, stop.

13:41.861 --> 13:43.597
Let him go.
Let him go, man. Let him go.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.115
I'm not scared of you, Will.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.191
If you're gonna be on our team,

13:47.291 --> 13:51.404
you need to watch your mouth,
lose the attitude, chill out.

13:57.113 --> 13:59.110
Is that how you all feel
about me?

14:03.861 --> 14:05.858
Okay.

14:06.936 --> 14:08.932
Maybe you right, Kirk.

14:10.490 --> 14:12.486
Maybe I am
on the wrong fucking team.

14:19.953 --> 14:23.127
387

14:23.227 --> 14:24.684
Oh. Hey, Ms. Hughes.

14:24.784 --> 14:25.802
Do you need any help with that?

14:25.902 --> 14:27.200
No, I got it. Thanks.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.675
Oh, it's no problem,
I'm hap--

14:29.775 --> 14:31.552
wait, what's going on?

14:31.652 --> 14:33.269
I am--

14:33.369 --> 14:36.264
I am no longer a teacher
at Bel-Air Municipal.

14:36.364 --> 14:38.859
What? Why?

14:38.959 --> 14:40.376
I'm not allowed
to answer any questions

14:40.476 --> 14:42.013
you may have about it.

14:42.113 --> 14:43.451
They can't do this to you.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.723
Don't you worry
about me, Ashley.

14:47.823 --> 14:50.558
You just keep being
the amazing,

14:50.658 --> 14:53.433
brilliant young woman
that you are.

14:53.533 --> 14:56.947
And never, ever let anyone
try to change you, okay?

15:04.473 --> 15:05.931
<i>I already spoke
with Carlton.</i>

15:06.031 --> 15:07.648
<i>However, any changes we make</i>

15:07.748 --> 15:09.804
<i>would require your input
and consent.</i>

15:09.904 --> 15:12.200
<i>So how do you both
feel about it?</i>

15:12.300 --> 15:15.434
Well, Carlton seems
to be doing great.

15:15.534 --> 15:17.310
Part of the reason
he had panic attacks

15:17.410 --> 15:18.728
was because I was putting
too much pressure on him.

15:18.728 --> 15:20.145
I stopped doing that.

15:20.245 --> 15:22.980
You're not the only pressure
in his life, Phil.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.376
There's grades. There's girls.

15:25.476 --> 15:27.253
There's probably stuff
that we don't even know about.

15:27.353 --> 15:29.169
You're describing life, Viv.

15:29.269 --> 15:32.443
What are we supposed to do,
keep him on meds forever?

15:32.543 --> 15:34.879
I mean,
if that's what it takes.

15:34.979 --> 15:36.596
Am I wrong, Doctor?

15:36.696 --> 15:39.431
<i>I think that pretty soon,
he'll be an adult.</i>

15:39.531 --> 15:41.587
<i>And you won't have
a say in the matter.</i>

15:41.687 --> 15:44.941
<i>It might not be a bad thing
to earn a little goodwill now</i>

15:45.041 --> 15:47.457
<i>by showing him
that he has your trust.</i>

15:47.557 --> 15:48.934
<i>Weaning off meds
isn't something</i>

15:49.034 --> 15:51.031
<i>we want him doing on his own.</i>

15:54.624 --> 15:55.522
Thank you, Doctor.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.619
<i>You're welcome.</i>

yourself, girl.

16:14.908 --> 16:15.966
This is killer.

16:16.066 --> 16:17.962
Cut. Cut.

16:18.062 --> 16:20.518
Ivy, we've literally
done this 12 times.

16:20.618 --> 16:21.516

16:29.043 --> 16:31.099
- I should be behind the wheel.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.736
I already told Jazz
I'd be the one driving it.

16:32.836 --> 16:34.653

Ivy, this is so sick.

17:06.855 --> 17:09.790
- Jazz?
- Cut.

17:09.890 --> 17:10.908
Ms. Ivy, hey.
How you doing?

17:11.008 --> 17:12.425
Um, I'ma need you
to park this car

17:12.525 --> 17:14.182
and, uh, politely step out
the vehicle.

17:14.282 --> 17:17.536
Really? You too?

17:17.636 --> 17:19.972
<i>♪ I'm my own boss,

17:20.072 --> 17:22.727

with a fucking sandwich,

17:22.827 --> 17:24.444
and then you just
gonna lie to me?

17:24.544 --> 17:25.762
I wasn't lying.

17:25.862 --> 17:27.319
I was the one who was driving,

17:27.419 --> 17:28.996
but Ivy insisted
on switching it up.

17:29.096 --> 17:30.753
What is it with you and Ivy?

17:30.853 --> 17:33.029
Y'all got this whole
frenemies vibe going on.

17:33.129 --> 17:34.506
She always forcing you
to do stuff.

17:34.606 --> 17:36.602
That's not true.

17:37.321 --> 17:39.138
Okay, so name a time
besides this.

17:39.238 --> 17:41.573
Okay, would you have
called me your boyfriend

17:41.673 --> 17:43.969
if Ivy wasn't
pushing up all on me?

17:44.069 --> 17:45.047
That was a moment
where I realised

17:45.147 --> 17:46.564
how much I cared for you.

17:46.664 --> 17:48.042
On the way over here,
I noticed that only I have

17:48.142 --> 17:49.719
posted about our relationship
on IG.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.156
I never said
I'd do that, Jazz.

17:51.256 --> 17:52.334
Why would you want
thirsty motherfuckers

17:52.334 --> 17:53.432
thinking that you single?

17:53.532 --> 17:56.387
Baby, I'm an influencer, okay?

17:56.487 --> 17:57.904
Which means
there are two Hilarys.

17:58.004 --> 18:01.099
And Hilary, the brand,
has to maintain

18:01.199 --> 18:03.295
this aura of attainability.

18:03.395 --> 18:04.492
The aura of what?

18:04.592 --> 18:06.130
Babe, it's just business.

18:07.627 --> 18:09.124
What you're saying is
we official,

18:09.224 --> 18:10.442
but we not gonna go public?

18:10.542 --> 18:13.956
Yes, exactly.
You get it.

18:21.842 --> 18:23.379
You hear from Reid yet?

18:23.479 --> 18:24.657
I mean, I called him
a few times,

18:24.757 --> 18:27.012
and he hasn't called me back.

18:27.112 --> 18:29.049
Avoiding, just like a coward.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.924
I'm not gonna let Reid
of all people ruin our dinner.

18:32.024 --> 18:33.321
Hey, how's everybody doing?

18:33.421 --> 18:35.418
all: Good.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.712
Hey, uh, are you gonna
tell Mum and Dad

18:38.812 --> 18:40.708
that you quit
the basketball team?

18:40.808 --> 18:42.804
Where'd you hear
that nonsense?

18:44.082 --> 18:45.579
Look, I didn't quit.

18:45.679 --> 18:47.676
I just left over some bullshit.

18:52.906 --> 18:54.903
You okay, bumblebee?

18:56.101 --> 18:58.417
No, actually.

19:00.413 --> 19:01.830
Ms. Hughes got fired today.

19:01.930 --> 19:03.188
Wait, I'm sorry. What?

19:03.288 --> 19:04.945
No. Ms. Hughes?

19:05.045 --> 19:06.462
For what?

19:06.562 --> 19:07.700
Well, when I saw her,

19:07.800 --> 19:09.097
she said she couldn't
talk about it.

19:09.197 --> 19:11.094
Wait, this is terrible.
I loved Ms. Hughes.

19:11.194 --> 19:12.491
All of you loved her.

19:12.591 --> 19:14.687
I saw Mrs. Kwan
talking to her last week,

19:14.787 --> 19:16.165
and it seemed like
she was in trouble.

19:16.265 --> 19:17.882
I'm calling
an emergency meeting

19:17.982 --> 19:20.158
of the Parental Advisory
Board to get some answers.

19:20.258 --> 19:22.234
And the administration
better have a damn good reason

19:22.334 --> 19:24.111
for firing one
of the few Black teachers.

19:31.558 --> 19:33.095
531

19:35.231 --> 19:36.489
Hey, son.

19:36.589 --> 19:38.006
You have a moment to talk?
- Oh, yeah.

19:38.106 --> 19:40.082
Yeah, yeah.
I'm ready to hear the verdict.

19:40.182 --> 19:42.198
So your father and I talked,

19:42.298 --> 19:44.754
and we've decided
to lower your dosage.

19:44.854 --> 19:46.111
Yeah.
You can start tomorrow.

19:46.211 --> 19:47.629
Thank you so much.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.424
Look, this is
the right decision.

19:50.524 --> 19:52.021
Thank you guys.

19:52.121 --> 19:54.856
But you're gonna keep us
in the loop, though, right?

19:54.956 --> 19:56.533
Let us know how you're feeling?

19:56.633 --> 19:58.250
'Cause there are side effects
with weaning off your meds--

19:58.350 --> 19:59.847
headaches, dizziness.

19:59.947 --> 20:01.324
So if you have
any stress or triggers,

20:01.424 --> 20:02.882
you have to come to us
right away.

20:02.982 --> 20:04.239
Yeah. Yeah, I promise.

20:04.339 --> 20:06.515
And remember,
there's no shame

20:06.615 --> 20:07.873
going back to your
current dosage

20:07.973 --> 20:09.969
if you need to, okay, baby?

20:12.964 --> 20:14.541
I love you guys.

20:23.665 --> 20:25.661
Oh, shit.

20:32.050 --> 20:33.427
Hello?

20:33.527 --> 20:37.180
Hey, Jackie.
Yo, this is Will.

20:37.280 --> 20:42.092
Yeah, Will,
the guy who's scared of dogs.

20:42.192 --> 20:45.126
Or the guy who showed up
and showed out on the court.

20:45.226 --> 20:47.881
<i>Thanks for hitting me back.
Is now a good time to talk?</i>

20:47.981 --> 20:49.838
Depends on what
you got to say.

20:49.938 --> 20:51.395
Well, you seem to know
a thing or two about Doc

20:51.495 --> 20:52.952
and how we operates, so--

20:53.052 --> 20:54.549
<i>Smooth.</i>

20:54.649 --> 20:57.305
<i>Just what a girl
wants to hear.</i>

20:57.405 --> 20:58.702
Anyways, it was good talking.

20:58.802 --> 21:00.818
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold up. Hold up, girl.

21:00.918 --> 21:03.494
You ain't let me finish.

21:03.594 --> 21:05.610
What I was trying to say is,

21:05.710 --> 21:07.526
I want to get
to know you better.

21:07.626 --> 21:08.884
Uh-huh.

21:08.984 --> 21:10.361
<i>And you're the one
who told me,</i>

21:10.461 --> 21:11.719
<i>if you wanna make
a good impression,</i>

21:11.819 --> 21:14.314
don't just talk a good game.

21:14.414 --> 21:17.588
So when can I see you again?

21:20.124 --> 21:22.540
I'm free later.

21:22.640 --> 21:25.454
You down to meet me somewhere?

21:25.554 --> 21:27.131
Yeah.

21:27.231 --> 21:28.369
Sure.

21:28.469 --> 21:29.447
How much later?

21:29.547 --> 21:31.204
Later.

21:31.304 --> 21:34.638
It's an after-hours spot
in Inglewood.

21:34.738 --> 21:35.996
<i>Look, if you need
a permission slip--</i>

21:36.096 --> 21:39.949
No. No.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.865
I'll meet you
any time, anywhere.

21:43.682 --> 21:45.259
Let's make it happen.

21:45.359 --> 21:46.936
Due to the recent events

21:47.036 --> 21:49.412
surrounding Ms. Hughes'
sudden firing,

21:49.512 --> 21:50.929
I just feel that we,

21:51.029 --> 21:52.526
as the Parental Advisory Committee,

21:52.626 --> 21:54.842
really need to get a handle
on this situation.

21:54.942 --> 21:57.477
From what I understand,
her firing wasn't sudden.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.594
The administration has had
to talk to Ms. Hughes

21:59.694 --> 22:01.350
several times
about teaching outside

22:01.450 --> 22:02.988
the approved curriculum.

22:03.088 --> 22:05.543
We have a system in place
that she willfully ignored.

22:05.643 --> 22:07.539
Then maybe it's the system
we should be scrutinising,

22:07.639 --> 22:09.097
not the teacher.

22:09.197 --> 22:11.173
As an educator,
isn't Mrs. Hughes expected

22:11.273 --> 22:12.690
to challenge our kids
and expose them

22:12.790 --> 22:14.247
to different points of view?

22:14.347 --> 22:16.404
Personally, my daughter
has been exposed

22:16.504 --> 22:19.558
to amazing authors
because of Ms. Hughes,

22:19.658 --> 22:22.233
people like James Baldwin,
Toni Morrison,

22:22.333 --> 22:24.509
Paula Giddings,
Ta-Nehisi Coates.

22:24.609 --> 22:26.346
I hear you, Vivian. I do.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.981
But bottom line is that
Ms. Hughes was fired

22:29.081 --> 22:30.858
for a clear
and repeated violation

22:30.958 --> 22:32.575
of the school's
curriculum policy.

22:32.675 --> 22:34.671
There's no getting around it.

22:37.586 --> 22:40.022
I guess we'll see about that.

22:46.251 --> 22:49.185
I was hoping
I'd find you here.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.282
Phil.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.376
The last time we spoke,
you didn't seem

22:54.476 --> 22:55.374
to have much to say to me.

22:55.474 --> 22:57.490
Yeah.

22:57.590 --> 23:00.285
I wasn't ready to go there yet, but...

23:00.385 --> 23:03.080
I'm here now, if it's okay.

23:12.763 --> 23:15.359
Well, I'm listening.

23:17.954 --> 23:20.270
You know, when you told Will
about his father...

23:22.865 --> 23:24.862
I don't think
I'd ever been angrier.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.635
I knew you'd be livid
when you found out.

23:28.735 --> 23:30.352
Right.

23:30.452 --> 23:34.485
See, that's the thing, G.
You know me better than anyone.

23:36.002 --> 23:38.378
You knew how I'd react.

23:38.478 --> 23:40.474
And you did it anyway.

23:47.861 --> 23:50.057
Which means you had
a damn good reason.

23:55.607 --> 23:58.262
I know you been
thinking about Frederick.

24:01.197 --> 24:03.193
Yeah.

24:04.471 --> 24:05.769
How are you doing?

24:11.339 --> 24:15.372
I'm not feeling great about
the decisions I've made, Phil.

24:17.847 --> 24:20.063
He's my son.

24:20.163 --> 24:21.301
But you know
why you can't see him.

24:21.401 --> 24:22.699
Yeah. I know. I get it.

24:22.799 --> 24:23.996
For this very reason,
'cause if your emotions--

24:23.996 --> 24:25.174
I said I get it, Phil.

24:25.274 --> 24:26.452
I understand
the fucking arrangement.

24:26.552 --> 24:27.809
I'm not an idiot, you know.

24:27.909 --> 24:31.643
I'm the one that made it.
Here, I get it.

24:31.743 --> 24:33.739
But here?

24:35.216 --> 24:37.233
He's my family. You understand?
- I am too.

24:37.333 --> 24:38.431
No, no, no, no, no.

24:38.531 --> 24:39.748
You made it perfectly clear.

24:39.848 --> 24:41.984
I work for you.

24:42.084 --> 24:44.899
And that's why
I am truly sorry

24:44.999 --> 24:47.974
for what I said.

24:48.074 --> 24:50.489
I was disrespectful.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.046
I was out of line.

24:52.146 --> 24:56.099
And I will never
let that happen again.

24:59.174 --> 25:00.232
It's gonna take time,
you know.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.629
I understand that.

25:01.729 --> 25:05.902
But just know
that I love you, bro.

25:06.002 --> 25:08.297
We all do.

25:08.397 --> 25:11.771
So come back home
and let us show you how much.

25:11.871 --> 25:13.089
Yeah?

25:50.243 --> 25:52.139

Will?

25:52.239 --> 25:54.375
Damn.

25:54.475 --> 25:55.813
Carlton, what are
you doing up, man?

25:55.913 --> 25:59.726

messing with my sleep lately.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.363
What are you doing up?

26:01.463 --> 26:02.701
I was just checking on you
'cause I knew you've been--

26:02.701 --> 26:05.036
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just stop.

I did not know

30:14.212 --> 30:15.510
Jackie was your niece,
all right?

30:15.610 --> 30:17.307
I ain't mean no disrespect
out there.

30:17.407 --> 30:18.624
You're cool.

30:18.724 --> 30:21.898
This isn't about Jackie.

30:21.998 --> 30:23.815
Let's talk about you.

30:23.915 --> 30:25.133
What's up?

30:25.233 --> 30:27.489
Why does a D-I prospect
from Philly

30:27.589 --> 30:29.844
pop up in Bel-Air in the middle
of the school year?

30:29.944 --> 30:31.441
What, your mums put you out?
- Hell no.

30:31.541 --> 30:33.717
She would never do that.
She the GOAT.

30:33.817 --> 30:36.832
Pops in the picture?

30:36.932 --> 30:38.309
You know how it is.

30:38.409 --> 30:39.507
Another day, another deadbeat.

30:39.607 --> 30:40.785
Being my own man.

30:40.885 --> 30:42.462
Respect.

30:42.562 --> 30:44.139
Hopefully,
that experience shaped you

30:44.239 --> 30:45.656
into someone who can
handle hard truths

30:45.756 --> 30:47.533
instead of soft lies.

30:47.633 --> 30:50.048
Yo, whatever you got to say,
just hit me with it.

30:50.148 --> 30:54.281
That fancy Bel-Air team
got you and your game soft.

30:54.381 --> 30:55.838
Oh, you don't believe me?

30:55.938 --> 30:58.194
How many D-I scouts
been there to see you play?

30:58.294 --> 31:02.187
Man, anybody at Bel-Air
got a NIL deal or a D-I offer?

31:02.287 --> 31:04.982
You're right.
Look, what am I supposed to do?

31:05.082 --> 31:06.619
Man, you gotta
showcase your talents

31:06.719 --> 31:08.296
where they can be appreciated.

31:08.396 --> 31:10.811
Man, AAU is where
all the stars are.

31:10.911 --> 31:13.007
It's where real players
are guided and developed

31:13.107 --> 31:14.605
to the best D-I colleges.

31:14.705 --> 31:17.200
And they end up
with the NIL deals.

31:17.300 --> 31:18.757
So you're saying
I have to quit Bel-Air

31:18.857 --> 31:21.392
to play for your team?
- Nah, not at all.

31:21.492 --> 31:24.267
We got players that play
for they school and us.

31:24.367 --> 31:25.984
There's ways
we can make it work.

31:26.084 --> 31:28.100
Look, just give me the time
and the place and I'm there.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.698
I'll be in touch.

31:36.346 --> 31:38.522

32:02.779 --> 32:04.955

32:05.055 --> 32:08.029
- Hey! Viv.
- Aww, welcome, Geoffrey.

32:08.129 --> 32:10.026
- It's so great to see you.
- Likewise, man.

32:10.126 --> 32:11.783
Ash.
- Hi.

32:11.883 --> 32:14.099
- What's good, G?
- I'm trying.

32:14.199 --> 32:16.295
Beside this warm welcome,
I don't want any fuss.

32:16.395 --> 32:17.732
You get me?

32:17.832 --> 32:19.489
We should just get back
into our routines,

32:19.589 --> 32:22.484
and from my watch, you three
are about ten minutes behind

32:22.584 --> 32:23.761
getting out that door.
- All right. Okay.

32:23.861 --> 32:25.039
We missed you too.

32:25.139 --> 32:27.395
Why is he like this?

32:27.495 --> 32:29.232
Have a good day.

32:29.332 --> 32:30.869
You know, I know you said
you don't want no fuss,

32:30.969 --> 32:33.903
but I can't help
but think about it.

32:34.003 --> 32:34.941
You left because of me.

32:35.041 --> 32:37.577
No, no words to that, man.

32:37.677 --> 32:39.673
No more looking back, yeah?

32:40.751 --> 32:41.809
I'm just glad
that we both found

32:41.909 --> 32:43.207
our way back into this house.

32:43.307 --> 32:44.444
Yeah.

32:44.544 --> 32:45.922
Yo, how'd you two
squash your beef, anyway?

32:46.022 --> 32:48.318
That's our business, Will.

32:48.418 --> 32:50.194
But I will say,
brotherhood is precious

32:50.294 --> 32:52.231
however and wherever
you can find it.

32:52.331 --> 32:54.467
It's not something
you just throw away

32:54.567 --> 32:56.822
over one disagreement.

32:56.922 --> 32:58.819
Anyways, you'll have
plenty of time to catch up

32:58.919 --> 33:00.136
now that he's back,
so why don't you get yourself

33:00.236 --> 33:01.294
to school before you're late?

33:01.394 --> 33:02.492
All right.
You got it, bud.

33:02.592 --> 33:04.129
See you, G.
- Later.

33:04.229 --> 33:05.687
Oh, I give it to Reid.

33:05.787 --> 33:08.162
That man has got some nerve.

33:08.262 --> 33:09.640
Yeah? What'd he say?

33:09.740 --> 33:11.995
He thinks I'm upset
because the entire article

33:12.095 --> 33:13.593
is about him, and he's right.

33:13.693 --> 33:16.148
The article should be about me
and my perspective.

33:16.248 --> 33:18.065
It's my art.

33:18.165 --> 33:19.163
It sounds like
you're gonna have to take

33:19.163 --> 33:21.419
the gloves off, baby.

33:21.519 --> 33:23.655
And I, for one,
can't wait till you do.

33:29.944 --> 33:32.119
Mum, have you heard anything
else about Ms. Hughes?

33:32.219 --> 33:33.557
A little bit.

33:33.657 --> 33:34.835
The school is claiming

33:34.935 --> 33:36.751
they fired Ms. Hughes
for just cause.

33:36.851 --> 33:39.067
One of your classmates
apparently told her parents

33:39.167 --> 33:41.423
that they saw her giving books
that weren't a part

33:41.523 --> 33:44.537
of the approved curriculum.

33:44.637 --> 33:47.053
Are you sure
there's nothing else we can do?

33:47.153 --> 33:51.565
Honey, I never said
there's nothing that we can do.

33:51.665 --> 33:54.480
I mean, I can't make
any promises,

33:54.580 --> 33:56.157
but what I know is this.

33:56.257 --> 34:00.309
If no one disrupts the system,
the system doesn't change.

34:08.754 --> 34:10.371

to say that.

34:44.211 --> 34:46.747
I think we should take
our relationship up a notch.

Oh, I thought it was just
gonna be us having lunch.

35:35.679 --> 35:37.137
What's going on?

35:37.237 --> 35:40.211
Well, I thought

35:40.311 --> 35:43.625
maybe you'd wanna have lunch
with me and my boyfriend.

35:45.183 --> 35:46.879
Your boyfriend?

35:48.736 --> 35:49.754

35:49.854 --> 35:51.831

Mr. and Mrs. D.

35:54.366 --> 35:57.660

How's it going?

35:57.760 --> 35:59.018
Of course we would.

35:59.118 --> 36:00.415

36:03.829 --> 36:05.806

36:05.906 --> 36:06.884
Thank you, Daddy.

36:06.984 --> 36:09.679
Okay. Well, let's eat.

36:09.779 --> 36:12.055
Let's eat.

36:14.051 --> 36:16.546
The administration
is firing Ms. Hughes

36:16.646 --> 36:18.543
because they're caving
to a few white parents

36:18.643 --> 36:19.940
who are upset with her.

36:20.040 --> 36:23.215
All she's guilty of
is exposing her students

36:23.315 --> 36:25.331
to books that are honest
about race,

36:25.431 --> 36:27.327
sexuality,
and American history.

36:27.427 --> 36:28.765
Mm, take your time, bishop.

36:28.865 --> 36:30.442
And we have to do something
about it.

36:30.542 --> 36:32.877
Look, I know Ms. Hughes
works in the middle school,

36:32.977 --> 36:34.634
but her firing reflects
on the entirety

36:34.734 --> 36:35.752
of the Bel-Air campus.

36:35.852 --> 36:37.190
Carlton's right.

36:37.290 --> 36:39.106
Ms. Hughes looked
after so many of us

36:39.206 --> 36:41.183
when we were having
a hard time in middle school.

36:41.283 --> 36:42.660
We owe her this.

36:42.760 --> 36:44.856
I think that rallying
to save Ms. Hughes' job

36:44.956 --> 36:46.952
is a cause worthy of our BSU.

36:48.150 --> 36:50.965
I agree.

36:51.065 --> 36:52.882
I think that this is
the perfect cause

36:52.982 --> 36:55.437
for us to show the school that
we are here and we won't allow

36:55.537 --> 36:58.671
one of the few beloved
Black teachers to be dismissed.

36:58.771 --> 37:00.388
Yeah.

37:00.488 --> 37:01.906
This is our school too.

37:02.006 --> 37:03.263
Actually,
you know what I think?

37:03.363 --> 37:04.461
I think it's time
that we let them know

37:04.561 --> 37:05.779
that we not playing no more.

37:05.879 --> 37:07.056
I think we should protest.

37:07.156 --> 37:09.013
- Oh, shit.
- Protest?

37:09.113 --> 37:10.570
Yes.

37:10.670 --> 37:12.407
Yeah, maybe we just
leave class for a while,

37:12.507 --> 37:13.645
like--like a walkout.

37:13.745 --> 37:14.683
Exactly, bro.

37:14.783 --> 37:16.679
But it's not a walkout.

37:16.779 --> 37:18.356
It's a Blackout.
- Yeah.

37:18.456 --> 37:21.072
Yeah!

37:21.172 --> 37:22.190
Yeah.
- Yeah?

37:22.290 --> 37:24.286
Yeah, I like that.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.736
1004

37:29.836 --> 37:31.573
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, hi. I'm Vivian Banks.

37:31.673 --> 37:33.809
I have a meeting with Reid.

37:33.909 --> 37:35.606
I'm sorry.

37:35.706 --> 37:37.482
There was an emergency,
and he has to reschedule.

37:37.582 --> 37:39.878
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

37:39.978 --> 37:41.236
Is everything okay?
Is someone hurt?

37:41.336 --> 37:42.833
No, it's not like that.

37:42.933 --> 37:47.385
It's more of an art emergency,
if you know what I'm saying.

37:47.485 --> 37:49.780
An art emergency?

37:49.880 --> 37:53.893
That's why he canceled
our meeting with no notice?

37:53.993 --> 37:56.528
I'm sorry, Mrs. Banks.

37:56.628 --> 37:58.724
You know, will you give
your boss a message for me?

37:58.824 --> 38:01.440
Please tell
that smooth-talking narcissist

38:01.540 --> 38:04.434
that I do not need him
explaining my work in the press

38:04.534 --> 38:06.950
or controlling my narrative
with the fellowship.

38:07.050 --> 38:10.384
He is not my handler.
He is not my gatekeeper.

38:10.484 --> 38:13.219
So I will no longer be
in need of his services.

38:13.319 --> 38:16.293
You might wanna
tell him that yourself.

38:16.393 --> 38:18.849
Oh, I would,

38:18.949 --> 38:21.683
but I have
an art emergency of my own.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.513
Carlton.

38:27.613 --> 38:30.228
What's up, Ms. Bassin?

38:30.328 --> 38:31.945
I was surprised
to hear you speak

38:32.045 --> 38:34.141
about Ms. Hughes today
with such passion.

38:34.241 --> 38:35.778
Oh.
Well, yeah, of course.

38:35.878 --> 38:37.535
I mean, she is a great teacher,

38:37.635 --> 38:40.290
and I think what's happening
to her is really unfair.

38:40.390 --> 38:43.165
I agree, of course.

38:43.265 --> 38:44.762
But there's a right way
to handle things

38:44.862 --> 38:47.677
and a wrong way
to handle things,

38:47.777 --> 38:49.554
especially here.

38:49.654 --> 38:53.227
Well, my cousin and I
were just talking,

38:53.327 --> 38:55.024
you know, brainstorming.

38:55.124 --> 38:58.298
We're not actually gonna
get up and walk out of school.

38:58.398 --> 38:59.736
I'm glad to hear that, Carlton,

38:59.836 --> 39:01.892
because as the person
who suggested

39:01.992 --> 39:04.088
BSU take up this cause,

39:04.188 --> 39:06.204
your reputation
will be tied to it.

39:06.304 --> 39:07.682
Be careful.

39:24.232 --> 39:26.568
Yeah, I'm all good.
Ain't gonna start no drama.

39:26.668 --> 39:29.083
All right, glad to hear that,
'cause it's been a long time

39:29.183 --> 39:30.681

39:30.781 --> 39:33.316
I mean, we have a chance

39:36.530 --> 39:38.027

Carlton X? Okay.

39:55.856 --> 39:57.473
Yeah, maybe we should just
sit on that for a second

39:57.573 --> 39:58.950
before we decide to keep it.

39:59.050 --> 40:01.186
I wanted to talk to you
about the, um--

40:01.286 --> 40:02.624
you know, the walkout.

40:02.724 --> 40:04.221

40:05.758 --> 40:07.335
Whatever we decide to call it,
I just,

40:07.435 --> 40:08.972
you know, don't think
it's a good thing.

40:09.072 --> 40:10.849
Well, it's not supposed
to be a good thing.

40:10.949 --> 40:12.646
It's a protest.

40:12.746 --> 40:14.163
But that's why you're
gonna be a hero to all

40:14.263 --> 40:15.960

40:16.060 --> 40:18.156
But like, I don't know,
what if--

40:18.256 --> 40:20.711
what if we're just
going too far?

40:20.811 --> 40:23.227
Look, man, stay strong, okay?
I got your back.

40:23.327 --> 40:24.744

40:26.721 --> 40:28.577

40:28.677 --> 40:32.011
You'll see.
- I'll see what?

40:32.111 --> 40:34.806
Coach has been all over
my back since I got here.

40:34.906 --> 40:37.442
But tonight, I'm gonna
show him the real Will.

40:37.542 --> 40:39.997
West Philly Will.

40:40.097 --> 40:41.395
- Yeah, okay, but--
- Don't worry.

40:41.495 --> 40:42.832
I'ma show you how it's done.

40:42.932 --> 40:44.749

42:11.454 --> 42:13.311
This next play, I want you
to swing the ball out to Kirk.

42:13.411 --> 42:14.748
What the hell?
Kirk has been cold all game.

42:14.848 --> 42:15.946
- No, I haven't.
- Hey, Will--

42:16.046 --> 42:17.224
- How many points do you have?
- Will!

42:17.324 --> 42:18.781
I don't wanna
hear it, Will, okay?

42:18.881 --> 42:21.576
Just get the ball out to Kirk.
End of discussion.

42:21.676 --> 42:23.413

- No, sir.
