WEBVTT

00:00.463 --> 00:03.343
Taking it out on
everyone isn't fair.

00:03.407 --> 00:06.825
Before you get completely carried
away playing Jesus, just spare

00:06.908 --> 00:09.451
a thought for Liz Birdsworth.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.705
You fucked up any chance
I had of a life with my kids.

00:12.832 --> 00:15.583
I don't think I can do this.
Don't forget I'll be there with you,

00:15.707 --> 00:18.045
every step of the way.
Jodie Spiteri's making serious

00:18.170 --> 00:21.088
allegations against you.
Well, Bea should be here.

00:21.213 --> 00:24.343
I want Bea!
Just as long as you enjoy it,

00:24.468 --> 00:27.763
Jianna. I need you to find out
who this Jianna is.

00:27.888 --> 00:29.963
I think Ferguson was in love
with her or something.

00:29.972 --> 00:32.643
She really is a freak.
Slot her.

00:32.768 --> 00:35.310
You're a fucking
battered old whore!

00:35.438 --> 00:38.816
I've been getting these flashes.
I'm not sure if they're memories.

00:38.941 --> 00:40.901
You've lost time
because of the accident.

00:41.026 --> 00:43.112
Your brain's trying to find it.
Who's this?

00:43.237 --> 00:45.384
He's the man who drugged me.
He works for Ferguson.

00:45.393 --> 00:46.536
He's her thug.

01:36.150 --> 01:37.918
Will there be pain?

01:38.817 --> 01:42.188
How much can I take?
Why do I have to suffer?

01:44.757 --> 01:47.166
Because you're nothing!

01:51.098 --> 01:54.391
Be good to get back into general,
wouldn't it? Have a shower.

01:56.397 --> 01:59.928
I don't know how you look in
the mirror. You're so ugly.

02:00.008 --> 02:01.975
How do you look at yourself?

02:02.969 --> 02:04.012
Liar.

02:04.695 --> 02:07.623
Liar. Liar.

02:13.523 --> 02:16.134
All it takes is a moment of courage.

02:17.216 --> 02:20.710
Do you have the courage?
I have the courage.

02:21.553 --> 02:25.082
I have the courage.
I have the courage!

02:49.688 --> 02:51.293
Hey, Mr Fletcher.

02:51.414 --> 02:55.066
You know that sketch that you took?
You know who that is, don't you?

02:55.147 --> 02:57.234
Just tell me. Come on.

03:05.540 --> 03:09.474
I saw him in the carpark
the day you said you got abducted.

03:09.554 --> 03:12.647
He got into a white van.

03:12.767 --> 03:16.658
I think that was the van
that hit me. He was the driver.

03:16.778 --> 03:20.553
So, if he's Ferguson's thug that
means that she was behind it.

03:20.713 --> 03:24.327
Why would Ferguson want to hurt you?
I have no idea.

03:24.889 --> 03:26.893
You know, obviously
she didn't want me around.

03:27.014 --> 03:32.793
But there's a whole lot of stuff
I don't remember before the accident,

03:32.914 --> 03:35.926
like how you got hold of
my swipe card. The day you escaped,

03:36.047 --> 03:37.851
how'd you get it?
I found it.

03:37.972 --> 03:41.344
See that lie right there?
That's why I don't trust you.

03:41.465 --> 03:43.551
What...?
Now get back to work.

03:48.889 --> 03:50.935
'Housing affordability -
it's certainly a hot topic.

03:51.055 --> 03:54.428
'Most people want to grow up and buy
their own home at some stage.

03:54.548 --> 03:56.958
'It's a mark of independence and it
certainly lets you start to build

03:57.078 --> 04:00.369
'a future. But it's becoming harder
and harder, particularly for young

04:00.529 --> 04:03.460
'people to get into the market.
Happy to take your calls, as always...'

04:23.529 --> 04:28.986
Let go of me! You fucking bitch!

04:36.252 --> 04:38.579
Come on, Anderson.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.044
Boo!

04:49.294 --> 04:51.825
He's beautiful, Anderson.

05:08.962 --> 05:12.976
Hand down. Thank you.

05:16.949 --> 05:18.594
You look like you're 50.

05:18.675 --> 05:20.602
What are you wearing?

05:20.683 --> 05:22.489
It's my job interview suit.

05:22.609 --> 05:25.620
What jobs did you go for?
Bakery. A jewellery shop at

05:25.740 --> 05:29.192
Chadstone. That was cool.
And your solicitor's got all that?

05:29.312 --> 05:31.118
Yeah, he said
he's gonna say something.

05:31.239 --> 05:33.487
And I did volunteer work
at an old people's home.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.454
Community-minded, even better.

05:41.514 --> 05:43.399
I hate this.
Look, your solicitor

05:43.480 --> 05:46.730
will do all the talking for ya, OK?

05:46.850 --> 05:49.701
And if the judge asks you anything,
it's "Your Honour."

05:49.862 --> 05:54.156
No "sirs, ma'am's, Your Majestys." They get
pissed off when you get it wrong. OK.

05:54.237 --> 05:56.203
You're totally stressin' out.

05:58.813 --> 06:00.899
I wish you could come with me.

06:01.020 --> 06:05.394
Ah, you'll be right.
Fuckin' five!

06:05.515 --> 06:07.522
Yeah, yeah.
It's five. Even I know...

06:07.642 --> 06:10.773
Even I fuckin' know it's five.
Anderson?

06:10.893 --> 06:13.101
Nah!
I'll be alright from here,

06:13.222 --> 06:15.832
thank you.
Nah! But no!

06:15.910 --> 06:17.918
You're shit! This is shit!

06:18.038 --> 06:20.327
Oh! Fuck!
Dor! Oh, hello, love!

06:20.406 --> 06:23.336
Oh, my god!

06:23.417 --> 06:24.982
Darling, he's beautiful!

06:25.103 --> 06:28.834
Oh, he's awesome.
How are ya, love?

06:29.718 --> 06:31.485
Good.
You're good?

06:31.605 --> 06:34.414
Dors, come. Come.
What is it?

06:34.534 --> 06:37.585
Come and have a look. Surprise.
OK. What is it?

06:37.706 --> 06:41.238
It's a surprise. Hey?
It's alright, isn't it?

06:42.843 --> 06:44.648
Guys, this is amazing.

06:44.729 --> 06:46.656
Oh, thank you.

06:48.221 --> 06:50.348
He's gonna be right
at home here, Dor.

06:50.468 --> 06:53.880
I hung the mobile.
Did you? Aww!

06:53.961 --> 06:55.404
Hey!

06:55.524 --> 06:58.014
Good-looking kid.
Sure I'm not the dad?

06:58.134 --> 07:00.102
Soph, isn't he gorgeous?
Yeah.

07:00.222 --> 07:03.473
Wasn't that long ago
I was bringing you home.

07:03.593 --> 07:05.680
Congratulations.
Thanks.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.453
You look nice. Good luck.
Yeah, thanks.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.909
Hey, you want to have a hold?

07:14.029 --> 07:15.153
Me?
Hey.

07:15.273 --> 07:17.641
No.
Oh, go on.

07:17.763 --> 07:21.093
Let Liz.
She looks like she wants a hold.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.661
I'd love a hold, Dor.

07:23.781 --> 07:28.720
Oh, little thing.
Little, tiny man.

07:29.761 --> 07:31.609
Little, tiny man.

07:31.730 --> 07:35.942
Little, tiny man. I don't think
he's smiling at you, Booms.

07:43.154 --> 07:46.448
I have the courage.
I have the courage.

07:47.732 --> 07:50.304
Jodie! Sarah!

07:52.350 --> 07:55.321
'Code black, psych unit.
Code black, psych unit.'

07:59.861 --> 08:01.506
Darling, no-one's
going to hurt you.

08:01.626 --> 08:05.001
We just want to get you
to a hospital, OK?

08:05.804 --> 08:09.297
I've got the courage! I've got
the courage! I've got the courage!

08:09.457 --> 08:12.350
Listen to me. What'd she do to you?
She bit me. What have you done, Spiteri?

08:12.429 --> 08:13.997
I've got the courage.

08:14.118 --> 08:18.053
Get up. OK, we're gonna get
you to the hospital, alright?

08:18.173 --> 08:21.908
It's OK. It's OK.
Come on, it's OK.

08:22.028 --> 08:28.251
It's OK. It's alright, it's alright.
Nice and easy, nice and easy.

08:30.341 --> 08:33.794
Did you see it happen? No.
No, I don't know how it happened.

08:57.205 --> 09:00.418
I see here you recommended
she be released back into general.

09:00.539 --> 09:04.394
Yes, she seemed ready. She was
keen to get back to the other women.

09:04.514 --> 09:07.287
So this has come as
a surprise to you?

09:07.407 --> 09:09.454
Yes, it has.
I'm merely trying to understand

09:09.536 --> 09:12.748
how you... got it so wrong.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.937
The psych staff said you paid her
a visit earlier this morning.

09:20.057 --> 09:21.984
Yes, I did.
And how was she?

09:22.104 --> 09:25.077
Well, she certainly didn't
present as ready for release.

09:25.197 --> 09:28.691
She seemed quite agitated, of all
things, about the way she looked.

09:28.812 --> 09:31.664
I mean, perhaps trying to destroy
her vision is a way of

09:31.743 --> 09:33.590
coping with that.

09:34.835 --> 09:39.052
Well, it is possible your visit
prompted her to self-harm. I mean,

09:39.172 --> 09:42.584
she is progressing well, and then
you step in and pay her a visit.

09:42.705 --> 09:46.278
I have been checking in on Spiteri
regularly and without incident.

09:48.166 --> 09:51.499
How often?
Most days. Time permitting.

09:51.620 --> 09:55.798
I can't imagine how stressed
that would have made her feel.

09:55.919 --> 09:58.327
She's in my care and
I am concerned for her,

09:58.448 --> 10:00.256
and as the facts bear out,
with good reason.

10:00.376 --> 10:03.188
She's just brought
serious charges against you.

10:03.309 --> 10:06.681
Your concerns could quite as easily
be interpreted as intimidation.

10:06.802 --> 10:10.094
I am merely trying to do
my job, Ms Westfall.

10:10.173 --> 10:11.742
I suggest you do yours.

10:18.287 --> 10:19.411
In your report,

10:19.532 --> 10:22.222
make sure you include her
recommendation on Spiteri. I mean,

10:22.343 --> 10:24.902
it's borderline criminal negligence
the way she missed the signs.

10:24.911 --> 10:25.916
Hmm.

10:26.879 --> 10:29.652
Is there something else?
This incident has made me realise

10:29.772 --> 10:32.582
I should exclude myself
from level three procedures.

10:34.471 --> 10:37.001
My hep-C status.
Oh.

10:37.563 --> 10:39.489
I'll mention it at
the next staff meeting.

10:39.570 --> 10:41.095
Is that wise?

10:42.220 --> 10:44.470
You're an executive officer. If you
don't want to perform a level three,

10:44.549 --> 10:46.598
you don't have to explain why.

10:46.719 --> 10:48.645
You have aspirations
for a governorship.

10:48.766 --> 10:52.019
They won't give it to you
if they know about your condition.

10:58.324 --> 11:01.417
Oi. Have you heard about Jodes?
No.

11:01.537 --> 11:04.069
Hacked herself up, apparently.
And not just her arms. She went

11:04.189 --> 11:06.476
for her face as well. She's got
a bandage over one of her eyes

11:06.596 --> 11:08.804
and they've taken her to hospital.
Shit.

11:08.925 --> 11:10.452
You shouldn't have
pressured her like that.

11:10.572 --> 11:12.943
She wasn't up to it after
everything Ferguson did to her.

11:13.063 --> 11:16.354
I wish I'd never
fuckin' listened to you.

11:17.642 --> 11:21.173
Well, Ferguson could be behind it.
She's done it before.

11:23.062 --> 11:24.951
We said we'd protect her.

11:29.325 --> 11:31.295
Oh, he's beautiful, Dor.

11:31.375 --> 11:34.065
Oh, darling, he's so gorgeous.

11:34.546 --> 11:37.841
Oh, must bring back memories
of Artie and Soph, eh?

11:37.921 --> 11:39.486
Yeah, it does, love.

11:39.606 --> 11:42.457
Yeah.
Hey, it'll be OK.

11:42.578 --> 11:44.989
Sophie will come back
to you, honey.

11:45.068 --> 11:46.554
Do you reckon?

11:46.674 --> 11:50.651
Well, it might take some time,
but yeah, I reckon.

11:50.733 --> 11:52.577
Hey, Jess. Welcome back.

11:52.660 --> 11:54.187
Jess, come and meet the little one.

11:54.307 --> 11:55.913
He's here.
Yeah.

11:56.673 --> 11:58.482
Hey, this is Jess.

11:58.603 --> 12:01.213
I've gotta hold him.
You can hold him.

12:01.292 --> 12:03.260
Just support his head. I know.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.764
He's so perfect.

12:10.008 --> 12:11.975
I could eat you.

12:12.097 --> 12:14.547
Joshua?
Joshua.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.875
Hello, little Joshua.

12:16.995 --> 12:20.648
You know that nasty Ms Ferguson,
she tried to keep me from you.

12:20.731 --> 12:23.220
But I'm here now

12:23.341 --> 12:26.433
and I'm gonna take
good care of you.

12:27.837 --> 12:30.770
Hey. Come on, I'll show you
her room. Hey.

12:30.890 --> 12:33.260
How're you doing, Dor?
Yeah, good.

12:33.381 --> 12:35.991
How's bubba?
Oh, he's going well.

12:36.111 --> 12:37.876
Hey, has Ferguson seen Joshua since
she's been back from the birth?

12:38.038 --> 12:40.810
She completely blanked me and didn't
even look at him. Really? Oh, that's weird.

12:40.930 --> 12:44.223
I don't want to ask her any more
questions about Jianna, OK?

12:44.344 --> 12:47.635
I don't want her anywhere near him.
OK, fair enough.

12:47.758 --> 12:51.693
The cold bitch wouldn't even
let Nash visit in the hospital.

12:51.773 --> 12:53.499
I'd better check on bubs.

12:57.032 --> 12:58.841
Hey?
Mm?

12:58.962 --> 13:00.569
You keep an eye on her
and baby at all times, OK?

13:00.647 --> 13:02.174
Don't leave 'em alone.

13:02.294 --> 13:05.547
Ferguson wouldn't
hurt a baby, would she?

13:18.007 --> 13:21.741
That looks hard going.
Pet project.

13:21.858 --> 13:26.109
You ready for your parole hearing?
Well, I've got a lot going on.

13:26.191 --> 13:28.115
I hadn't given it much thought.

13:29.521 --> 13:31.726
Well, don't leave it
till the last minute.

13:35.055 --> 13:37.103
I thought
we weren't doing this anymore.

13:39.549 --> 13:41.315
We can still talk.

13:44.884 --> 13:47.048
What do you want to talk about?

13:47.130 --> 13:48.854
Jodie Spiteri.

13:53.707 --> 13:56.877
What do you know?
Did Ferguson stick her in the eye?

13:56.957 --> 13:59.927
In a way. Possibly.

14:02.732 --> 14:04.178
Come on.

14:14.125 --> 14:17.094
You said you saw Ferguson visiting
Jodie in the slot.

14:17.214 --> 14:21.023
It all fits with what Jodie told us
and what we put in the complaint.

14:21.105 --> 14:22.828
Ferguson was torturing her.

14:24.312 --> 14:27.522
Do you believe Smith's story
about the man in the boiler room?

14:27.643 --> 14:30.171
Do you?
I'm starting to.

14:31.774 --> 14:34.220
So, what are you gonna do about it?

14:34.340 --> 14:38.113
I don't know.
Oh, god, I have to be careful.

14:42.724 --> 14:44.850
Do you miss me?

14:55.321 --> 14:56.403
I can't...
I know.

14:56.523 --> 14:57.768
..do this.
I know.

14:57.888 --> 15:01.337
I can't. I know.
Not here. Not yet.

15:01.416 --> 15:04.384
Ms Westfall. Can I speak to you?

15:05.466 --> 15:06.753
She didn't see anything.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.974
So, what can I help you with?

15:30.106 --> 15:31.711
It's true, isn't it?

15:33.315 --> 15:35.121
You and Franky Doyle.

15:40.735 --> 15:44.108
Nothing has happened
between Franky and I.

15:44.228 --> 15:47.275
The moment the rumours started,
I debriefed my supervisor

15:47.395 --> 15:51.166
and, on his advice, I stopped my
sessions with Franky and referred

15:51.288 --> 15:53.533
her to another therapist.
So why were you hiding in

15:53.653 --> 15:56.058
the bookshelves?
We weren't hiding.

15:56.178 --> 15:59.229
We were talking about something
of a private nature.

15:59.349 --> 16:00.834
And Franky felt more
comfortable talking there

16:00.954 --> 16:02.879
instead of out in the open.
What were you talking about?

16:02.999 --> 16:07.693
I can't tell you. I'm sorry, it's
confidential between Franky and me.

16:09.736 --> 16:13.066
If you had any integrity,
you'd hand in your resignation.

16:13.187 --> 16:16.718
Now you're just responding
to the rumours.

16:16.839 --> 16:20.207
You plant an idea in someone's head
and they search for confirmation of

16:20.328 --> 16:23.536
it wherever they look. You can
make people believe anything.

16:25.419 --> 16:28.351
You tell me, Ms Bennett,

16:28.471 --> 16:30.675
what do you think
happened to Jodie Spiteri?

16:30.795 --> 16:33.925
Don't change the subject.
No, no, come on.

16:34.005 --> 16:35.729
You must see the pattern.

16:35.850 --> 16:39.501
Ferguson visits her in isolation,
and she shivs Bea Smith.

16:39.621 --> 16:43.512
She visits her in the psych unit
and she self-harms.

16:43.632 --> 16:46.241
Spiteri is a liar and
a known self-harmer.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.851
Yes, I know she did that to herself
because Ferguson made her.

16:49.972 --> 16:51.736
Wow, you'd say anything
to keep your job.

16:51.857 --> 16:54.262
Well, what would
you do to keep yours?

16:54.342 --> 16:55.825
Anything Ferguson asked you?

16:57.313 --> 16:59.919
She is a formidable character.

17:01.882 --> 17:04.167
I bet she's hard to say no to.

17:04.289 --> 17:06.616
Ms Ferguson has her
own way of doing things.

17:08.178 --> 17:10.665
But it is always within the rules.

17:10.787 --> 17:13.234
Ohh!
And for the benefit of the women,

17:13.355 --> 17:17.204
even if it might not
seem so at the time.

17:17.325 --> 17:19.773
I deal with a lot
of victims of abuse,

17:19.894 --> 17:22.382
and a lot of them make excuses
for the people who hurt them.

17:22.461 --> 17:25.067
They enable them.

17:25.188 --> 17:28.077
And they do it because
they think that fits with

17:28.154 --> 17:31.243
who they are and what they deserve.

17:31.324 --> 17:34.013
You are another one of her victims.

18:11.198 --> 18:13.804
There's been some news
on Jodie Spiteri.

18:13.925 --> 18:16.971
There's been
some news on Jodie Spiteri.

18:21.703 --> 18:23.470
Vera?

18:24.312 --> 18:25.356
Yes, Governor?

18:26.800 --> 18:29.648
You're preoccupied with something?
No, I'm just thinking.

18:31.452 --> 18:34.102
Um, overtime budget. I don't
think we'll meet it this month.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.744
Oh, we can beat it into the next.

18:35.865 --> 18:38.231
As long as we're right
for the end of the quarter.

18:38.313 --> 18:39.837
Thank you.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.800
Welcome.

18:42.484 --> 18:46.173
You're all busy, so we'll move
through these items quickly.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.940
Jodie Spiteri.
Now, her doctor tells me that

18:49.021 --> 18:53.836
her right eye is permanently damaged.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.522
She may yet lose it.

18:55.642 --> 18:58.008
Now, there was
a no-sharps order on her cell.

18:58.127 --> 19:02.379
The instrument she used on
herself was apparently a pencil.

19:02.499 --> 19:05.709
Now, according to the safety
regulations, a pencil

19:07.232 --> 19:10.363
does not qualify as a sharp,
so technically, there's no

19:10.442 --> 19:12.446
breach of duty of care from our end.

19:12.567 --> 19:18.344
So, how did it come to be in
her cell and who left it there?

19:18.465 --> 19:20.711
Well, that is my
question exactly.

19:24.362 --> 19:27.330
Nice and loose for the nappy.
They're good, aren't they?

19:27.511 --> 19:29.157
Yarn. Yarn...

19:30.403 --> 19:36.343
Oh! The knitting people. It's not
easy. It's not fuckin' relaxing!

19:38.470 --> 19:42.000
Do you want me to help?
Would ya?

19:42.764 --> 19:43.766
Yeah.

19:47.660 --> 19:51.993
Here. OK, let's have a little look.

19:52.113 --> 19:56.209
So, the first thing
you've gotta do is cast on.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.773
Oh, yeah, it says that in the book.
Yep.

19:57.894 --> 20:01.185
Now, the number of stitches you cast
on depends on what you're making.

20:01.306 --> 20:04.555
So, what are you making?
Oh, booties, for Joshy.

20:04.635 --> 20:06.441
Can I suggest a scarf?

20:06.522 --> 20:08.208
Nah, I need it to be booties.

20:08.329 --> 20:11.538
You know, it's your first time,
a scarf is a lot easier to...

20:11.658 --> 20:13.383
Look, are you gonna help me or
are you just gonna boss me round?

20:13.465 --> 20:15.431
I'm gonna help ya.

20:15.551 --> 20:17.920
Good, cos I want it
to be special, right?

20:17.998 --> 20:19.605
It's all good.

20:19.684 --> 20:21.329
There you go.

20:24.621 --> 20:26.787
This is our son.

20:26.869 --> 20:28.635
Look at him.

20:28.712 --> 20:30.357
Hello, mate.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.607
Here, do you wanna have a hold?

20:32.689 --> 20:34.132
Yeah, alright.

20:35.176 --> 20:36.419
Grab him.

20:36.540 --> 20:39.066
Joshie.
Got his neck?

20:39.186 --> 20:43.200
Yeah.
You're a natural, honey.

20:49.785 --> 20:52.875
Hey? Thank you, baby.

20:54.638 --> 20:55.923
Thank you so much.

21:03.348 --> 21:04.913
My little Joshua.

21:08.325 --> 21:10.733
You're gonna have
a good life, mate.

21:10.811 --> 21:12.779
I'm gonna make sure of that.

21:13.862 --> 21:16.872
You've got the best mum
in the world.

21:20.245 --> 21:21.770
And your old man?

21:22.772 --> 21:25.341
He's not gonna put
a foot wrong, ever, mate.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.695
Hey. Hey.

21:45.816 --> 21:49.057
What's that in your hand?
It's just this.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.979
Oh, they're cute.
Oh, they're beautiful!

21:54.099 --> 21:57.381
Hey, doing a good job, Booms.
Thank you.

21:58.423 --> 22:00.382
I'd die before I'd let
anything happen to Josh.

22:00.505 --> 22:04.188
I always wanted a kid
of me own, you know?

22:04.307 --> 22:07.310
And I tried to get Daz to
knock me up, but he'd always

22:07.389 --> 22:09.432
pull out at the last second.

22:09.590 --> 22:13.915
You know, I think he thought I wanted
to trap him or something, but I didn't.

22:14.035 --> 22:21.959
Anyway, now... with everything,
I'll be, ah, 43 before I get out,

22:22.239 --> 22:24.962
so it's too late.

22:26.041 --> 22:28.402
Too late? No, no, it's not.

22:28.523 --> 22:30.603
I know plenty of women who
get pregnant in their forties.

22:30.724 --> 22:35.447
Who's gonna wanna get me pregnant?
You'll find someone.

22:36.248 --> 22:38.169
Oh, bullshit.
Hey!

22:38.288 --> 22:41.894
No, no-one's gonna want me. I've got a
feeling you'll have guys lining up.

22:42.014 --> 22:45.654
I s'pose it must shit you, too,
eh, not being able to have a bub?

22:49.738 --> 22:53.781
I have put some sperm away,
just on the off-chance.

22:54.703 --> 22:59.584
What? So, what, you got
your spoof frozen or something?

22:59.665 --> 23:01.106
Uh-huh.

23:01.744 --> 23:04.069
Yeah?
Mm-hm.

23:05.749 --> 23:06.910
Really?
Yeah.

23:09.709 --> 23:11.513
Hey.

23:11.633 --> 23:14.074
How'd you go?
Yeah, I get sentenced in two weeks.

23:14.155 --> 23:15.515
OK.

23:17.196 --> 23:20.036
Hey, what do you reckon about that?

23:20.157 --> 23:22.878
Veggies?
Yeah.

23:22.999 --> 23:24.683
Victim's wife wants
to meet with ya.

23:24.802 --> 23:27.805
Well, do I have to do it? It says it
won't affect my sentence if I don't.

23:27.924 --> 23:30.966
Well, even though they say
it doesn't, it always does.

23:31.086 --> 23:33.047
And the judge'll definitely
take it into consideration.

23:33.166 --> 23:34.649
Yeah, but if it's just about
being angry with me,

23:34.769 --> 23:37.171
then I'm not gonna do it.
Well, it's up to you.

23:37.291 --> 23:41.533
But if you really are sorry,
then telling her face-to-face,

23:41.653 --> 23:45.134
it'll give her closure.
And maybe you, too.

23:46.176 --> 23:48.058
You'll be right.

23:49.178 --> 23:52.981
Hey, that that was good advice.
Thanks.

23:58.265 --> 23:59.263
Hi.

24:01.787 --> 24:05.589
So, who'd you have
lined up for your spoof?

24:10.151 --> 24:11.433
To have the baby?

24:12.072 --> 24:14.554
We had this girlfriend

24:14.674 --> 24:17.358
who was gonna do it,
but it all fell to bits once

24:17.438 --> 24:19.920
Gary and I had our breakup.

24:19.997 --> 24:22.441
What, she took his side?

24:22.562 --> 24:25.883
Well, in her defence,
I... I did stab him.

24:27.524 --> 24:28.523
Cow.

24:35.888 --> 24:37.573
G'day.
Back to see the little bub?

24:37.650 --> 24:38.850
Yeah.

24:39.891 --> 24:42.455
Have you seen him?
Yeah, he's gorgeous.

24:42.574 --> 24:43.616
Yeah. There'll be a little
wait to check these.

24:43.736 --> 24:45.735
We're short-staffed, so...
I'll do it.

24:45.856 --> 24:47.778
Hey, Ms Ferguson?
Hmm?

24:47.898 --> 24:50.741
I'm Nash.
Doreen Anderson's partner.

24:50.860 --> 24:54.583
Thank you for letting me
come and see him again today.

24:54.702 --> 24:58.424
I think, for a newborn,
we can make an exception, yes?

24:59.103 --> 25:01.106
Wait here.

25:37.971 --> 25:41.335
What's this?
I don't know.

26:02.831 --> 26:04.686
Closer inspection
revealed more hidden drugs.

26:04.738 --> 26:07.659
The police have arrested him. He'll
be charged and sent back to Walford.

26:07.777 --> 26:10.422
He's not into drugs.
I do not understand,

26:10.542 --> 26:12.943
with so much to lose, how could
you risk something like that?

26:13.020 --> 26:16.705
Ms Ferguson, there's been a mistake.
I didn't know anything about that,

26:16.825 --> 26:18.667
and there's no way Nash is...
Was it Doyle?

26:18.786 --> 26:20.946
Did Doyle put you up to this?
No!

26:21.066 --> 26:22.510
Was it Bea Smith?
Of course not.

26:22.630 --> 26:24.629
Bea hates that stuff
more than anyone. Really?

26:24.750 --> 26:27.192
Wasn't that long ago she was
so high on drugs she had to be

26:27.311 --> 26:30.156
restrained for her own safety.
She's top dog now.

26:30.235 --> 26:32.195
Her priorities are different.

26:33.636 --> 26:37.518
And she's certainly not above using those
closest to her to get what she wants.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.640
And the question you have to ask
yourself, is she using you now?

26:44.445 --> 26:46.846
Warner's here to mind the baby
until the police have taken

26:46.924 --> 26:48.728
a statement. No.

26:48.848 --> 26:51.888
Doreen, it's for the best. You don't
want Joshua surrounded by all

26:51.968 --> 26:53.529
this upset now, do you?

26:55.011 --> 26:58.172
I'll take good care of him, Dor.
Go on.

27:02.936 --> 27:04.697
Come here, handsome.

27:05.899 --> 27:09.061
Come on, little fella,
let's get some fresh air.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.946
Hello, Mr Fletcher.

27:17.068 --> 27:19.428
Warner.
Have you met Joshua?

27:19.626 --> 27:21.671
Uh, no.

27:22.549 --> 27:24.032
You know, I miss us.

27:25.990 --> 27:30.075
I miss your smell on me.
I miss you inside of me.

27:32.195 --> 27:34.998
What... what are
you talking about, Warner?

27:35.157 --> 27:38.599
Don't you remember what you said to me?
No, I... I don't.

27:38.680 --> 27:41.082
You said that you loved me.

27:41.724 --> 27:44.565
No, I didn't.
And I love you.

27:46.044 --> 27:48.089
Stop playing games.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.408
I'm not playing games.

27:52.371 --> 27:53.731
Hey, check that out.

27:55.973 --> 27:58.575
I thought Doreen and her baby
were supposed to be having a visit.

27:58.694 --> 28:02.138
Well, they are.
Well, they were.

28:03.979 --> 28:04.979
Hey.

28:06.777 --> 28:08.340
What was that about?

28:08.460 --> 28:10.662
Nothing.
I was just showing him Joshua.

28:12.222 --> 28:15.747
Where's Doreen?
Something bad's happened.

28:18.109 --> 28:19.107
What?

28:19.869 --> 28:22.911
I don't know anything!
Tell us about the gear.

28:24.153 --> 28:25.993
What gear? I...

28:30.355 --> 28:32.998
Overtime sheets from last month.
Thank you.

28:37.520 --> 28:39.241
Yes, Vera?

28:41.082 --> 28:44.003
It was a fairly amateurish attempt,
by most standards.

28:44.123 --> 28:48.809
Well, these people are hardly
Mensa material, are they?

28:48.929 --> 28:50.770
Well, if you don't mind me saying,
I don't think Anderson would be

28:50.890 --> 28:53.971
knowingly involved.
On what basis?

28:54.090 --> 28:55.814
Her excellent record
as a peer worker.

28:55.933 --> 28:58.372
She's never returned
a positive drug test.

28:58.493 --> 29:01.897
She's never been implicated in any
drug activity during her time here.

29:02.017 --> 29:05.062
Well, that's debatable.
She's in here on a drug conviction.

29:05.181 --> 29:07.459
She's close to Bea Smith.
Her boyfriend is a dealer,

29:07.580 --> 29:10.504
both now, and obviously
during the garden project.

29:10.624 --> 29:13.265
You don't agree.
If she's guilty of anything,

29:13.385 --> 29:16.068
it's aligning herself
with the wrong people.

29:19.150 --> 29:24.070
With so much to lose,
you'd think she'd be more careful.

29:35.401 --> 29:37.322
Hey, Dor, are you OK?
Good?

29:37.441 --> 29:39.563
Where's Josh?
Jess is putting him to bed, love.

29:39.644 --> 29:41.163
Hey, so what's happened?

29:41.283 --> 29:45.205
Nash has broken parole,
so he's going back to Walford.

29:45.326 --> 29:48.169
They're gonna charge him
with drug trafficking.

29:48.246 --> 29:50.210
They wanna charge me with it.

29:51.809 --> 29:54.575
They called me an unfit mother.

29:54.653 --> 29:57.133
Hang on, but did you see the drugs?

29:57.215 --> 29:58.617
Did you touch 'em? No.

29:58.737 --> 30:00.336
Well, then, they're bullshitting
you. They can't prove anything.

30:00.456 --> 30:03.860
Did Nash give you any idea
he was bringing drugs in? No.

30:03.979 --> 30:07.261
He was so excited about
being a dad, he never would have.

30:07.383 --> 30:10.302
Never! Ferguson thinks you
were behind it.

30:10.422 --> 30:13.707
She what?
Were you?

30:14.306 --> 30:15.909
No!
So it could have been Ferguson.

30:15.987 --> 30:18.469
She set him up.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.312
What, she set up Nash?

30:22.353 --> 30:24.755
Because you made me
get close to her.

30:24.873 --> 30:26.835
No, we don't know
it was her for sure.

30:26.955 --> 30:28.915
Well, she was in medical
when the baby was born.

30:29.035 --> 30:33.638
Maybe she heard us
when I told you about Jianna.

30:33.720 --> 30:36.322
Oh, this is... this is payback.

30:36.399 --> 30:39.083
This is on you. This is your fault!

30:40.923 --> 30:43.725
Because you started
a fight you can't win.

30:55.493 --> 30:58.616
Mr Fletcher, can I have a word
with you, please?

30:58.737 --> 31:01.099
About what, Smith?
Not here.

31:01.776 --> 31:04.421
In private.
What?

31:05.620 --> 31:07.743
No way. Forget it.

31:07.863 --> 31:11.703
You wanna know the truth
about your swipe card or not?

31:37.244 --> 31:40.925
It was in here, in that cubicle.
You were with Jess Warner.

31:44.288 --> 31:46.567
That's how I got your swipe card.
No.

31:46.687 --> 31:49.371
I set it up.
I knew you had a soft spot for her.

31:49.492 --> 31:52.011
All I had to do was
put her in your way.

31:52.131 --> 31:54.254
Where's my swipe card?
Fuckin' just give me my card back!

31:54.336 --> 31:55.934
It was easy.

31:56.054 --> 31:58.617
If you're gonna blame anyone,
you blame me.

31:58.737 --> 32:00.417
No.
OK, I set this up.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.780
That is not true.

32:02.898 --> 32:04.861
We need to find out who
owns that van. Mr Fletcher...

32:04.939 --> 32:07.143
Stay away from me!

32:09.223 --> 32:10.706
Oh, fuck.

32:18.376 --> 32:20.573
Hey, what's going on?

32:20.651 --> 32:23.084
I need to... Yeah.

32:25.437 --> 32:28.785
And, look at me. You're gonna go
into your breathing, alright?

32:28.905 --> 32:32.932
In through the nose,
out through the nose.

32:33.013 --> 32:37.038
Look at me. That's it.

32:38.276 --> 32:39.273
Good.

32:50.836 --> 32:53.389
Fuck it! What happened?

32:54.944 --> 32:59.730
I saw you in Bridget Westfall's
office. You looked upset.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.483
She's, um...

33:01.563 --> 33:04.154
she's helping me with a few things.

33:04.275 --> 33:07.225
Like what?
Not here in the prison.

33:07.345 --> 33:10.256
I see her outside.
She has outside clients.

33:10.376 --> 33:15.756
You're a client of hers?
So? It's not a problem, is it?

33:15.838 --> 33:17.714
Oh, no. It's...

33:17.792 --> 33:19.787
Is it helping?

33:20.862 --> 33:24.928
Hey, come on. You know
you can talk to me, don't you?

33:26.047 --> 33:28.960
The work that we're doing,
it's confronting.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.468
It's trying to remember.

33:31.587 --> 33:33.943
The accident?
Yeah, and all the stuff around it.

33:35.136 --> 33:38.090
I mean, it's like hypnosis,
but it's not.

33:40.044 --> 33:44.031
It's more like a visualisation
technique that opens up your memory.

33:44.112 --> 33:45.746
Right.

33:47.021 --> 33:48.936
So, how does that work?

33:49.015 --> 33:50.331
She gets me to visualise

33:50.451 --> 33:54.758
a situation then she suggests things
and sometimes things come back to me

33:54.877 --> 33:57.348
and I can compare them with
the things I already know.

33:57.429 --> 33:59.064
Like what?

34:01.136 --> 34:05.045
I had an inappropriate
relationship with an inmate.

34:07.235 --> 34:09.152
I'm not telling you who.

34:13.139 --> 34:15.971
I feel really disgusting.

34:16.051 --> 34:17.047
Hey, Fletch.

34:18.761 --> 34:20.716
You've been struggling
with your memory.

34:20.876 --> 34:22.429
You said yourself you don't know
what's real and what's not.

34:22.552 --> 34:26.538
How do you know that this is real?
I think it's real.

34:32.280 --> 34:35.071
I'm gone, aren't I?

34:40.733 --> 34:43.406
Governor.
Yes, Vera?

34:45.797 --> 34:49.226
I have evidence of an inappropriate
relationship between a staff member

34:49.306 --> 34:52.377
and an inmate. Oh, yes?

35:15.705 --> 35:18.136
Stop what you're doing.
Step away from the desk. What?

35:18.215 --> 35:20.489
Do as I say.

35:23.839 --> 35:26.391
Am I being fired?
You're resigning.

35:26.512 --> 35:29.062
Believe me, it's far better
than the alternative.

35:29.182 --> 35:31.973
And what would that be?
Imagine the board.

35:32.093 --> 35:36.400
They put you in here to spy on me
and you take up with an inmate.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.951
That is rubbish.
Ms Bennett has furnished me

35:39.073 --> 35:41.542
with a statement of what she
witnessed between you and Doyle.

35:41.622 --> 35:43.375
Which was nothing.

35:43.498 --> 35:46.129
You don't really want to go through
a formal investigation, do you?

35:46.169 --> 35:48.122
I mean, you realise how damaging
that would be for you?

35:48.243 --> 35:52.429
I'll take that risk.
It will hurt you, your reputation,

35:53.425 --> 35:55.900
people close to you. I mean,

35:56.019 --> 35:59.090
your assessment of Franky Doyle,
that's critical to her parole.

35:59.168 --> 36:00.845
These allegations, you know?

36:00.963 --> 36:03.317
It would be impossible
for the Parole Board to consider

36:03.437 --> 36:07.702
your report on her.
I can see another, what,

36:07.781 --> 36:09.495
at least 12 months getting

36:09.616 --> 36:13.323
the proper assessments and paperwork
ready for her to lodge another bid.

36:14.880 --> 36:17.113
You would do that.

36:34.353 --> 36:36.006
Hey.
Hey.

36:36.849 --> 36:40.114
Do you want to come in?
Yeah. I'll...

36:41.507 --> 36:44.532
Nah, it's alright.
Hey. You try me out.

36:47.994 --> 36:49.309
What's up?

36:50.384 --> 36:52.853
We should have a baby together.

36:54.443 --> 36:57.189
You and me?
Yeah. Well, you know,

36:57.270 --> 36:58.823
with good behaviour and,

36:58.942 --> 37:03.957
uh, you know, a bit of luck, we'll
both be out around the same time.

37:04.076 --> 37:06.424
And, you know, if you still
wanted to have a baby and you

37:06.545 --> 37:11.082
didn't have anyone to, you know,
put your... your sperms into,

37:11.201 --> 37:14.264
then I'll be cool
with helping you out.

37:14.385 --> 37:17.172
I'm... I'm not really
sure what to say.

37:19.004 --> 37:21.630
Well, you still wanna
have a baby, don't ya?

37:21.749 --> 37:26.128
I mean, cos why else would
you have your sperms frozen?

37:26.209 --> 37:28.953
Well, that was when I was with Gary.

37:32.019 --> 37:34.806
You still want to have
a baby, though, don't ya?

37:37.392 --> 37:39.264
Well, a lot's changed since then.

37:39.343 --> 37:40.814
You know, I'm...

37:40.935 --> 37:44.279
Oh, Booms, I'm not really
sure what I want anymore.

37:45.870 --> 37:47.147
Mm.

37:48.858 --> 37:50.689
Well, maybe if you...

37:51.720 --> 37:54.907
if you held the baby in your arms,
then you would know,

37:55.026 --> 37:57.932
and it'd be good. Booms...
No, you're unreal.

37:58.053 --> 38:02.470
Right, I didn't know it before,
but, um, I do know it now.

38:03.945 --> 38:07.327
And all I want is to
have a baby one day.

38:07.446 --> 38:09.673
And, um, if all I've got
to offer you is,

38:09.792 --> 38:12.820
you know, the right plumbing,
then...

38:14.092 --> 38:18.035
I'm sorry, that's all I got.
But, um... but it's there

38:18.155 --> 38:21.815
and I reckon I'd be a really
good mum. I would.

38:21.935 --> 38:25.040
I reckon I'd be a really,
really good parent. Boom...

38:25.158 --> 38:28.542
No, I'd be a really good parent.
We both would.

38:28.623 --> 38:30.971
So... so you have...

38:33.161 --> 38:34.632
Don't cry.

38:44.265 --> 38:46.613
Why did you do that?

38:48.683 --> 38:50.515
Just cos you're having
inappropriate relations

38:50.635 --> 38:53.900
with a prisoner doesn't
mean everybody else is.

38:55.212 --> 38:57.162
Fletch?

38:57.281 --> 39:00.903
You planted ideas in his head
when you know how vulnerable he is.

39:01.024 --> 39:03.492
What would I stand to gain
by doing anything like that?

39:03.572 --> 39:05.560
I don't know.

39:07.591 --> 39:12.077
I can't discuss clients with you,
but I promise you, I did not plant

39:12.195 --> 39:14.217
anything in his head.
Keys.

39:19.694 --> 39:23.305
Have you submitted the incident
report on Jodie Spiteri yet?

39:24.299 --> 39:30.051
Not yet. Before you do,
have a look in her file.

39:34.696 --> 39:36.444
After you.

39:47.395 --> 39:49.736
Gidget.
What's going on?

39:49.856 --> 39:52.595
Back away from the fence, Doyle.
They getting rid of you? Fuck!

39:52.714 --> 39:55.053
What about my parole?
I'm never gonna get out of here.

39:55.132 --> 39:57.396
You'll be right.

39:57.517 --> 40:00.255
I'm sorry.
You did nothing wrong.

40:00.331 --> 40:01.801
Ms Westfall!

40:02.953 --> 40:06.761
I'll be at your hearing, OK?
Don't worry. Now.

40:31.924 --> 40:36.052
Vera, when Ferguson goes down,
and she will,

40:37.560 --> 40:40.811
be careful you don't
get sucked down with her.

40:57.362 --> 40:59.348
Doreen?

40:59.428 --> 41:01.808
Please go away.

41:01.927 --> 41:04.826
Look, I just wanted to say
that I'm really sorry...

41:04.903 --> 41:06.809
You used me.

41:06.887 --> 41:08.477
I didn't mean to.

41:08.554 --> 41:10.142
Yeah, you did.

41:10.816 --> 41:12.802
And my son.

41:16.133 --> 41:18.557
I should have left
you guys out of it.

41:18.674 --> 41:24.349
Josh won't have a father
until he's seven. Seven.

41:26.930 --> 41:29.626
I'll be raising him on my own.

41:29.707 --> 41:32.446
What am I meant to tell my son?

41:32.525 --> 41:35.183
She's the governor, Bea.

41:35.300 --> 41:37.089
What did you think
was gonna happen?

41:37.208 --> 41:41.137
Well, I'll make it right.
Oh, like you did with Jodie, hey?

41:42.368 --> 41:43.358
Go.

41:46.099 --> 41:48.003
Get out.

41:48.876 --> 41:50.504
Get out!

42:02.923 --> 42:03.916
Hey.

42:16.380 --> 42:18.285
I'm stepping down.

42:25.110 --> 42:27.055
Are you serious?

42:31.617 --> 42:34.198
I can't do this anymore.
I'm so tired.

42:40.031 --> 42:42.690
What?
I never wanted this anyway.

42:42.809 --> 42:45.945
And Doreen's right.
I've picked a fight I can't win.

42:46.064 --> 42:48.681
Bullshit. Because of me,
Ferguson

42:48.800 --> 42:52.730
is picking you off one by one.
Right? She is beyond evil.

42:53.843 --> 42:57.057
I can't beat her.
Love, you're not fighting her alone.

42:57.176 --> 43:01.065
I'm here. You can't stop
now, Bea. You can't.

43:02.731 --> 43:04.637
I won't let you.

43:55.516 --> 43:58.375
'Have you submitted the incident
report on Jodie Spiteri yet?'

43:58.493 --> 44:01.706
'Before you do, have
a look at her file.'
