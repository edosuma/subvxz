WEBVTT

00:04.482 --> 00:05.875
Previously onSEAL Team...

00:05.918 --> 00:08.095
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Williams, the JAG assigned

00:08.138 --> 00:09.226
to your defense.FLORES:
Master Chief Hayes is accused

00:09.270 --> 00:10.793
of voluntary manslaughter
for shooting

00:10.836 --> 00:13.187
Yazeed Nafal,
an unarmed Jordanian civilian

00:13.230 --> 00:15.624
Exhibit 3: cell phone footage
of the shooting.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.974
[gunshots over video]

00:18.018 --> 00:19.802
Command has issued
a no-contact order.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.195
You are to stay away
from each other and from Jason.

00:21.238 --> 00:23.719
My detailer called,
said that I should hear back

00:23.762 --> 00:25.242
about that Echo job
by next month.

00:25.286 --> 00:27.636
I'm pregnant.DAVIS:
She deserves a response.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.681
NAIMIA:
What do you need a lawyer for?

00:29.725 --> 00:31.553
The i-investigation involves
classified information.

00:31.596 --> 00:32.815
Why are you holding out on me?

00:32.858 --> 00:34.643
What happened to Sonny
wasn't on you.

00:34.686 --> 00:36.340
Everything falls on Bravo 1.

00:36.384 --> 00:37.733
Trial counsel
found out that, uh,

00:37.776 --> 00:39.343
Raqqa Jacques
was Ray's torturer.

00:39.387 --> 00:42.303
They think I shot an
unarmed man out of revenge.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.392
They upped the charges
to murder.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.918
WILLIAMS:Chief Warrant Officer Ray Perry
has already testified

00:48.961 --> 00:50.659
that when you found out
about Raqqa Jacques,

00:50.702 --> 00:52.269
you were determined
to get revenge on his behalf.

00:52.313 --> 00:53.792
That's not accurate.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.403
So much so that you charged
into that building

00:55.446 --> 00:56.969
loaded for bear and shot
the first man you saw.

00:57.013 --> 00:58.667
Look, it was a routine op.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.190
So it's routine for you
to murder unarmed civilians

01:00.234 --> 01:01.844
on operations?I didn't murder anybody.

01:01.887 --> 01:03.846
This is what they do.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.935
Push your buttons
to make you look volatile.

01:05.978 --> 01:07.806
All right, look, can we just runit again until I get it right?

01:07.850 --> 01:09.286
Keep running it.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.027
There's a reason most defendants
don't take the stand.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.507
Well, I'm gonna look more
guilty if I don't say anything,

01:12.550 --> 01:14.030
so I got to say something.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.814
The judge will instruct
the panel that not testifying

01:15.858 --> 01:17.512
is not an admission of guilt.

01:17.555 --> 01:20.080
I'd recommend the same to any
client facing a murder charge.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.516
[grunts softly]

01:23.431 --> 01:25.433
â™ª

01:34.442 --> 01:37.053
After Lindell comes Bravo.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.447
Uh, Spenser, Quinn,Sawyer, Reynolds, Carter,

01:39.490 --> 01:40.926
will all take the stand.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.406
What about Ray?

01:42.450 --> 01:44.104
He'll testify, but he's takenan immunity deal.

01:44.147 --> 01:46.106
Immunity from what?

01:46.149 --> 01:48.717
Dad's other teammates
didn't take any deals.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.284
Since Chief Warrant Officer
Perry was the OIC

01:50.327 --> 01:52.373
during the op in question,
the UCMJ

01:52.416 --> 01:54.679
could technically charge him--
regardless of the outcome

01:54.723 --> 01:56.507
of the trial-- with Article 92,

01:56.551 --> 01:58.248
failure to obeya lawful regulation.

01:58.292 --> 02:00.032
I'm sure the prosecution

02:00.076 --> 02:01.991
presented him with immunity, uh,

02:02.034 --> 02:03.732
in exchange for him
being on their witness list.

02:03.775 --> 02:05.168
Well, if he's working
with the prosecution

02:05.212 --> 02:06.996
that means he's gonna have
to testify against me.

02:07.039 --> 02:09.346
That's it.I don't know.

02:09.390 --> 02:11.131
I read his deposition
after it was unsealed.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.871
His answers
are deliberately vague.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.960
He was walking
a semantic tightrope.

02:15.004 --> 02:16.136
But he'll be
forced to take

02:16.179 --> 02:17.441
a strong position
in court, won't he?

02:17.485 --> 02:18.921
They'll want to use
your father's friendship

02:18.964 --> 02:20.531
to push the revenge angle,

02:20.575 --> 02:22.838
dramatize Chief WarrantOfficer Perry's captivity

02:22.881 --> 02:25.884
and say that his torture
was your father's motive

02:25.928 --> 02:28.365
to kill an unarmed man.
I think you should go
get some sodas for us.

02:28.409 --> 02:29.975
Dad, I can handle this.No, I think that you should go.

02:30.019 --> 02:30.976
I can do this.

02:31.020 --> 02:31.977
Luckily,this won't be tried

02:32.021 --> 02:33.544
in the court of public opinion,

02:33.588 --> 02:35.677
so you and your family won't get
dragged through the mud.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.157
The U.S. may bescapegoating you,

02:37.200 --> 02:38.245
but no one wantsthis situation to get out.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.334
Total media blackout.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.726
Oh, that's too bad.
I was really hoping

02:41.770 --> 02:43.598
to launch my T-shirt line
on 60 Minutes.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.252
WILLIAMS:No gallery, no teammates.

02:45.295 --> 02:46.601
No family. Not until
the verdict is announced.

02:46.644 --> 02:48.385
Sorry, Emma.

02:48.429 --> 02:49.691
[quietly]:
It's okay.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.780
The good news is you
have a lot of support.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.869
Unparalleled success
with high-profile missions.

02:53.912 --> 02:55.436
An otherwise peerless record.

02:55.479 --> 02:56.698
That's now been trashed.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.221
I've gathered

02:58.265 --> 03:01.485
over a dozen references
from past teammates.

03:07.491 --> 03:08.666
Great work.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.929
Thanks.Havinga "good sailor" book

03:10.973 --> 03:12.496
full of rave character reviews
are just the thing we'll need

03:12.540 --> 03:14.933
for leniency with the panel
in case of sentencing.

03:14.977 --> 03:16.108
Sentencing?

03:16.152 --> 03:17.153
Bad enough

03:17.197 --> 03:18.502
that the Navythinks I'm guilty.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.548
Now I have the two of you
convicting me.

03:26.771 --> 03:29.513
[music playing softly]

03:29.557 --> 03:32.212
[Stella grunting]

03:32.255 --> 03:36.433
Hey, um, I don't know
how this is all going to fit.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.522
I can't believe I accumulatedso much stuff.

03:38.566 --> 03:41.656
[sighs] Well, I can't believe
that I asked a hoarder

03:41.699 --> 03:42.961
to move in with me.

03:43.005 --> 03:45.399
Forgive me
for being sentimental,

03:45.442 --> 03:46.617
but you know, you never know

03:46.661 --> 03:48.010
what you're gonna
fall in love with again.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.403
Right?

03:49.446 --> 03:51.013
Did you just compare me
to this...

03:51.056 --> 03:52.493
this crusty
Walden Pond souvenir?

03:52.536 --> 03:54.712
Okay, perhaps
I need to declutter.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.061
I think that's
a good idea.

03:56.105 --> 03:59.021
You should, uh,
you should probably cast away

03:59.064 --> 04:00.849
all remnants of life
before you met me.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.807
Same to you.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.896
Actually, you know what?
Maybe we should, um,

04:04.940 --> 04:07.508
give all of our stuffthe Marie Kondo treatment.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.249
That sounds like a martial art.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.947
No, it's when you're, uh,
supposed to hold something

04:11.990 --> 04:13.862
and see if it "sparks joy,"

04:13.905 --> 04:18.345
and if it doesn't spark joy,
then you throw it out.

04:18.388 --> 04:19.955
I think this sparks joy.

04:19.998 --> 04:22.131
Mm? Mm-hmm.Mm-hmm. Little bit.

04:22.174 --> 04:24.046
Mm-mm-mm.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.222
[phone ringing]

04:26.266 --> 04:29.051
[both grunting]

04:29.094 --> 04:30.618
It's Jace.

04:32.620 --> 04:35.100
Hey, brother, what's up?

04:35.144 --> 04:37.494
No.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.540
No, I haven't heard from him.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.238
Yeah, let me...

04:42.282 --> 04:44.109
I'll see where
his head's at.

04:45.328 --> 04:46.503
Okay.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.291
That sounded ominous.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.336
Jason's worried about
what Ray's gonna say in court.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.165
And Jason can't contact
Ray directly, so...

04:56.208 --> 04:58.341
Look, I... [chuckles]

04:58.385 --> 04:59.560
I know that, I know that we said

04:59.603 --> 05:00.778
we would spend today together.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.476
It's okay.
Do what you need to do.

05:02.519 --> 05:05.870
I have... a little bit
to keep me busy.

05:05.914 --> 05:07.307
You sure?

05:07.350 --> 05:08.699
Just a little bit.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.048
All right.Okay.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.876
I'll be back soon, okay?Okay.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.922
[aircraft whooshing]

05:17.708 --> 05:19.710
We need to go back
to your JAG's office.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.103
You can't run from this.

05:21.146 --> 05:23.714
You think I'm guilty?
What?

05:23.758 --> 05:25.325
I mean, do you think I'm guilty?

05:25.368 --> 05:28.763
The way the prosecution is
spinning this right now, I-I...

05:28.806 --> 05:30.199
completely get
why my own daughter

05:30.242 --> 05:31.809
would think that I'm guilty.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.550
I know you like
to do things the right way.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.291
That's why I came down here
to help you.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.424
And that's why
you need to prepare.Prepare.

05:37.467 --> 05:38.512
Prepare for what,
my whole career

05:38.555 --> 05:39.861
to be flushed
down the toilet?

05:39.904 --> 05:41.210
I can't even speak
in my own defense here.

05:41.253 --> 05:42.254
Well, Lieutenant Commander
Williams

05:42.298 --> 05:43.865
said that's normal.
Normal?

05:43.908 --> 05:45.649
Like your best friend stabbing
you in the back? That's normal?

05:45.693 --> 05:46.868
You don't know
what's going on with him,

05:46.911 --> 05:48.217
but he wouldn't do that.He wouldn't do that.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.392
Uncle Ray's family.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.394
You know, I hope you're right.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.091
'Cause never did
I think the Navy

05:53.135 --> 05:55.398
would be railroading me, either,
but here I am.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.190
[sniffles]

06:09.281 --> 06:11.240
Hey.

06:11.283 --> 06:12.937
Hey.What are you doing here?

06:12.981 --> 06:14.852
Just want to see how
you're holding up.

06:14.896 --> 06:18.160
[scoffs] I'm fine. What makes
you think I need checking up on?

06:18.203 --> 06:21.032
Well, maybe 'cause your best
friend's on trial for his life?

06:21.076 --> 06:22.512
Or maybe because,
as OIC on the op,

06:22.556 --> 06:24.253
if Jason goes down,
you could be at risk.

06:24.296 --> 06:26.473
In this job, we're always in the
crosshairs. I got it handled.

06:26.516 --> 06:28.039
You got it handled as in...
as in lawyering up

06:28.083 --> 06:29.258
and getting immunity?

06:30.912 --> 06:32.957
Look, team knows you didn't
do anything out of bounds.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.742
Okay? Neither did Jason.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.919
Just want to know
what's going on with you, man.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.750
What part of "no-contact order"
don't you understand, Clay?

06:44.708 --> 06:46.318
All right.

06:51.193 --> 06:54.849
â™ª Sit here in the dark...

06:54.892 --> 06:57.721
HANNAH:
Sonny Quinn, what are you doing?

06:57.765 --> 07:00.463
Oh, uh, just taking a break.

07:00.507 --> 07:03.466
You know, I've defused bombs

07:03.510 --> 07:05.555
that are a lot less complicated
than this crib.

07:05.599 --> 07:07.209
[laughs]
Well, it's a good thing

07:07.252 --> 07:09.037
you have ten more weeks
to put it together.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.995
Yeah, well, it, uh,

07:11.039 --> 07:13.215
it might actually
take me that long.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.173
You know,
you're welcome here anytime.

07:15.217 --> 07:16.566
Lisa, too.

07:16.610 --> 07:19.917
Yeah. We'll definitely
take you up on that.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.702
[phone ringing]

07:22.833 --> 07:25.140
Oh, look at that.
Speak of the devil.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.317
Hey.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.405
DAVIS:
Hey.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.537
Your ears must've been burning.

07:30.580 --> 07:33.583
[laughs]Look at this right here.

07:33.627 --> 07:36.456
Is that crib still in pieces?

07:36.499 --> 07:38.240
[Hannah laughs]Yes, it is, okay?

07:38.283 --> 07:41.199
The damn Swedish Chef
wrote the directions.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.419
I told him he was
in over his head.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.334
[laughs]:
Hey, Hannah. How are you?

07:45.377 --> 07:46.988
I'm good.

07:47.031 --> 07:50.165
I'm, uh, trying to hire
a new manager at the bar.

07:50.208 --> 07:53.777
Hey, if you need anything,
um, we're here.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.040
Thanks, Lisa.

07:56.084 --> 07:58.042
I'll let you two catch up.Great. Thank you.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.261
Uh-- You okay?
I'm good.

07:59.304 --> 08:01.176
All right.

08:01.219 --> 08:03.265
Hey.

08:03.308 --> 08:04.745
Hi.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.529
I'm so sorry I had
to extend the trip,

08:06.573 --> 08:08.531
but, um, you know,
I didn't realize

08:08.575 --> 08:11.969
there was so much stuff to do
for one tiny human.

08:12.013 --> 08:12.970
How's everything going?

08:13.014 --> 08:15.190
Uh, well, I've almost finished

08:15.233 --> 08:18.062
collating the last of
the reports for the JAGs, and...

08:18.106 --> 08:20.238
I kind of wish
they'd just call me as a witness

08:20.282 --> 08:23.328
so I could defend
Jason publicly.

08:23.372 --> 08:24.939
[stammers]
The optics of working on behalf

08:24.982 --> 08:27.071
of the prosecution
does not look great.

08:27.115 --> 08:29.987
Well, that ain't your choice.
Echo knows that.

08:31.293 --> 08:33.513
You heard anything
on the new job?

08:33.556 --> 08:36.167
Not yet, but probably just
tangled up

08:36.211 --> 08:38.430
in the usual red tape.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.258
Them, uh, damn pencil pushers
better hurry their butts up

08:40.302 --> 08:42.434
because this right here, okay,

08:42.478 --> 08:44.436
has been a little classified
for too long.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.047
[laughs]

08:46.090 --> 08:47.614
DAVIS:
Mm... [chuckles]

08:47.657 --> 08:49.877
Right. I-I got to take Hannah

08:49.920 --> 08:53.837
to go see
the OB-GYN Kenobi doctor.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.360
Ah. No, I-I actually
have to go, too.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.014
We just got clearance
to complete

08:57.058 --> 09:00.365
the S.A. intel dossier
on Raqqa Jacques, so...

09:00.409 --> 09:02.193
Have fun with Hannah.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.587
I will. All right.
I'll call you later.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.589
Bye.Bye.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.373
WILLIAMS:The panel consists
of eight members.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.114
Three are enlisted
and two are battle-tested.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.812
They need three-fourths
to convict.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.857
The prosecution will want
to prove you're a loose cannon

09:13.901 --> 09:15.598
capable of war crimes.

09:15.642 --> 09:18.993
They'll have scoured through
every Bravo AAR and evaluation

09:19.036 --> 09:20.429
from the past two decades.

09:20.472 --> 09:21.691
What exactly
are they looking for?

09:21.735 --> 09:23.519
Violations of protocol,

09:23.563 --> 09:25.652
clashes between you
and other operators.

09:25.695 --> 09:29.307
Anything to show your emotions
overruled tactical judgement.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.571
If their plan is to make my dad
out to be a monster,

09:31.614 --> 09:32.746
what's our plan?

09:32.789 --> 09:34.617
Cite your father's track record.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.401
Highlight their shoddy
investigation.

09:36.445 --> 09:37.620
Discredit the bystander's

09:37.664 --> 09:39.056
incomplete video
of the shooting.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.623
You make it sound so easy.

09:40.667 --> 09:41.668
[knocking on door]

09:43.495 --> 09:45.759
Um, I'm sorry to interrupt,
Lieutenant Commander.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.804
I've got the Raqqa Jacques
dossier.

09:47.848 --> 09:50.067
I also wanted to share
something else with you.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.504
I was reviewing intel
from the Jordan op.

09:52.548 --> 09:56.160
That man with the tattoo holding
the AK, that's Yazeed Nafal.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.945
Whoa.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.033
Let me see that.

09:59.076 --> 10:00.861
EMMA:
That's the guy Dad shot.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.690
They said he was just a driver.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.430
In his recruitment
video, he calls for

10:05.474 --> 10:06.736
"death to the Western world."

10:06.780 --> 10:08.390
"Just a driver" my ass.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.174
I hope that helps.
WILLIAMS:
Excellent work.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.743
Davis, thanks.

10:13.787 --> 10:16.398
Good luck tomorrow.
We're all behind you.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.881
This is a game changer, right?

10:20.924 --> 10:23.274
Proving Nafal was an active
member of the AKM

10:23.318 --> 10:25.102
could demolish
the prosecution's case.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.364
Things are starting
to look up here.

10:26.408 --> 10:27.714
In the courtroom
tomorrow, remember,

10:27.757 --> 10:29.977
it's not just the facts
or your record on trial.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.240
The jury will be
watching you, too.

10:35.069 --> 10:37.158
So when JAG Flores
attacks your character,

10:37.201 --> 10:40.683
or a ruling goes against us,
you don't react.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.946
Stay calm in the chaos
and show the jury

10:42.990 --> 10:45.383
why they can trust you.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.263
All rise.

11:01.225 --> 11:03.575
Be seated, please.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.101
[gavel bangs twice]

11:07.144 --> 11:08.668
The court will now
come to order.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.495
Is the government prepared
to make an opening statement?

11:10.539 --> 11:12.759
Yes, Your Honor.
Permission to enter the well.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.717
Proceed.

11:14.761 --> 11:18.286
On 11 March, 2021,
while on a mission

11:18.329 --> 11:20.505
with SEAL Team Bravo
in Irbid, Jordan,

11:20.549 --> 11:23.552
Master Chief Jason Hayes
entered a residential building

11:23.595 --> 11:25.728
and shot and killed
Yazeed Nafal,

11:25.772 --> 11:27.861
an unarmed Jordanian civilian.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.385
The government will demonstrate
by means of video evidence,

11:30.428 --> 11:34.171
timeline and testimony that
Chief Hayes committed murder,

11:34.215 --> 11:36.826
motivated by revenge
on behalf of his best friend

11:36.870 --> 11:40.438
and fellow SEAL, Warrant Officer
Raymond Perry.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.136
This is a tragic event.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.790
While the government has
the utmost respect

11:43.833 --> 11:46.183
for Master Chief Hayes'
service to this country,

11:46.227 --> 11:48.751
he must be held accountable
for this heinous crime.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.583
The prosecution will tell you
that Master Chief Hayes

11:54.626 --> 11:56.280
went rogue.

11:56.324 --> 11:57.847
That he was overcome
with vengeance

11:57.891 --> 12:00.676
and shot an innocent man
in cold blood.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.460
Nonsense.

12:02.504 --> 12:05.681
It is Master Chief Hayes'
unwavering sworn statement

12:05.725 --> 12:09.163
that the deceased, Yazeed
Nafal, an AKM henchman,

12:09.206 --> 12:12.557
was holding an M1951 Beretta
in his left hand.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.821
The taking of a life
might be heinous

12:14.864 --> 12:17.301
to those of us fortunate enough

12:17.345 --> 12:19.260
to never have engaged
in combat,

12:19.303 --> 12:21.828
but the reality is that
Master Chief Hayes

12:21.871 --> 12:25.483
is wrongly on trial
for doing his job.

12:28.225 --> 12:29.923
Mr. Khalaf,
as the representative

12:29.966 --> 12:31.707
of Jordan's General
Intelligence Directorate,

12:31.751 --> 12:33.796
you have intimate knowledge
of the investigation.

12:33.840 --> 12:37.060
Could you tell us what was
discovered at the crime scene?

12:37.104 --> 12:40.368
Police found the body
of Yazeed Nafal in the hallway

12:40.411 --> 12:42.239
with two gunshot wounds
to the chest.

12:42.283 --> 12:45.852
Mr. Khalaf, was a weapon found
on or near Nafal's body?No.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.984
No weapons of any kind.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.334
What other evidence did the
police recover from the scene?

12:50.378 --> 12:52.293
A neighbor came forward to share

12:52.336 --> 12:54.948
a mobile phone video
he recorded.

12:54.991 --> 12:57.515
I will now play the footage
from this cell phone camera.

12:57.559 --> 12:58.603
Exhibit 2.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.525
[silenced gunshots, grunting]

13:19.233 --> 13:20.538
WILLIAMS:
Mr. Khalaf,

13:20.582 --> 13:23.150
the time stamp on the video
is 12:02 p.m.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.761
Police arrived
at 12:29 p.m.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.459
So it's conceivable
that in 27 minutes,

13:28.503 --> 13:30.461
a passerby could
have taken the gun.

13:30.505 --> 13:31.898
Perhaps even the police or...

13:31.941 --> 13:33.595
someone wanting to spin
the events in a different...

13:33.638 --> 13:34.639
Objection.

13:34.683 --> 13:35.684
Speculation.

13:35.727 --> 13:36.903
Sustained.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.643
WILLIAMS: Master Chief
Hayes is on record

13:38.687 --> 13:40.776
stating Nafal had a pistol
at his side

13:40.820 --> 13:42.734
in his left hand.

13:42.778 --> 13:45.259
Could the family of Yazeed Nafal
confirm he was left-handed?

13:45.302 --> 13:47.261
The victim's family,
in their grief,

13:47.304 --> 13:48.958
did not respond to your inquiry.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.307
The "victim."

13:50.351 --> 13:51.569
Right.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.745
Is the Jordanian
government aware

13:53.789 --> 13:56.618
Nafal was not working
for an officer of the AKM

13:56.661 --> 13:58.881
but was an enthusiastic member
of the AKM himself?

13:58.925 --> 14:00.361
I will now play

14:00.404 --> 14:02.189
Exhibit A.Objection.
Lack of foundation.

14:02.232 --> 14:04.278
The defense is putting
the victim on trial.

14:04.321 --> 14:05.409
Sustained.

14:05.453 --> 14:07.107
Your Honor,
I've admitted into evidence

14:07.150 --> 14:09.196
authenticated propaganda.I have reviewed

14:09.239 --> 14:10.588
your late submission

14:10.632 --> 14:12.416
and have ruled the evidence
to be inadmissible.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.070
The victim cannot
defend himself

14:14.114 --> 14:15.506
in this courtroom.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.509
The only person on trial
here is Master Chief Hayes.

14:18.553 --> 14:19.554
[slams table]

14:35.091 --> 14:37.267
The judge made a
perplexing ruling,
[exhales]

14:37.311 --> 14:39.922
but you can't
lash out like that.Perplexing?

14:39.966 --> 14:42.229
That's the word you use?
"Perplexing"?

14:42.272 --> 14:44.318
This judge, is he trying
to railroad me, too?

14:44.361 --> 14:45.710
My entire life

14:45.754 --> 14:47.712
is under the microscope here,

14:47.756 --> 14:50.672
and we can't discuss the fact
that this guy was a terrorist?

14:50.715 --> 14:52.717
It's one judge's bad decision.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.763
I'm confident it would be
overturned on appeal.

14:54.806 --> 14:57.287
Appeal?
My entire career will be over

14:57.331 --> 14:59.507
if this goes to appeal.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.249
Put it behind us for now.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.294
We've got enough to worry about
with Lindell.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.383
He'll want to distance himself
from any scandal.

15:06.427 --> 15:09.082
That's great. Lindell.
Guy's wanted me gone

15:09.125 --> 15:11.171
since he got here.

15:11.214 --> 15:13.260
Now is his shot.

15:13.303 --> 15:14.914
Master Chief Hayes
retired from operating,

15:14.957 --> 15:16.306
then asked to return
to field duty.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.004
Do you know why?

15:18.047 --> 15:20.615
He believed he would have the
most impact on the battlefield.

15:20.658 --> 15:23.009
Couldn't stay out
of the fight, could he?

15:23.052 --> 15:24.880
Did you have
any reservations

15:24.924 --> 15:27.361
about reinstating
Master Chief Hayes as Bravo 1?

15:27.404 --> 15:30.320
His performance mitigated
any of my concerns.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.670
FLORES:
Have you ever needed to
reprimand Master Chief Hayes

15:32.714 --> 15:33.802
for his conduct?

15:33.845 --> 15:35.804
Yes, on occasion.

15:35.847 --> 15:38.981
I have here an evaluation
dated 7 October 2019

15:39.025 --> 15:41.941
where you refer to Master Chief
Hayes as a "renegade."

15:41.984 --> 15:43.464
So, in your opinion,

15:43.507 --> 15:44.856
does the Master Chief

15:44.900 --> 15:46.423
play by his own rules?

15:53.691 --> 15:57.695
I was referring to his tactics,
not his character.

15:57.739 --> 16:00.524
While it's true the Master
Chief doesn't always do things

16:00.568 --> 16:02.657
the way I would like...

16:02.700 --> 16:05.312
I'm loathe to imagine what the
war on terror would look like

16:05.355 --> 16:07.618
without him
at the tip of the spear.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.969
In all my years in the Teams,

16:10.012 --> 16:12.101
I've come across
no finer operator

16:12.145 --> 16:14.495
than Master Chief Hayes.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.540
â™ª

16:21.676 --> 16:23.504
Appreciate you cleaning
yourself up, SO1 Quinn.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.245
Navy gave us relaxed
grooming standards

16:25.288 --> 16:26.942
so we could stay mission ready.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.465
You like

16:28.509 --> 16:31.860
going after guys for following
the rules, don't you? Hmm?

16:31.903 --> 16:33.253
When you passed the deceased
in the hallway,

16:33.296 --> 16:35.342
did you see a gun on his person
or on the ground?

16:35.385 --> 16:37.866
I didn't. No.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.172
No, sir, I did not.

16:39.215 --> 16:40.738
But I wasn't looking for one.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.262
You never even entered
the building,

16:42.305 --> 16:44.351
yet in your deposition,
you allege Master Chief Hayes

16:44.394 --> 16:45.352
followed the ROEs?

16:45.395 --> 16:47.180
If Master Chief Hayes shot
a man,

16:47.223 --> 16:49.138
that man had a weapon
or was a direct threat.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.357
You saw the victim enter
the building.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.532
Did you see him holding the gun

16:51.575 --> 16:52.881
Master Chief Hayes describes?

16:52.924 --> 16:54.970
One guy had an AK slung
over his shoulder.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.928
Other guy could have had
a concealed weapon.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.713
FLORES:
But you didn't see the
weapon on the victim?

16:58.756 --> 17:01.368
It was your regular Jihad Joe
working for AKM.

17:01.411 --> 17:02.891
The same terrorist

17:02.934 --> 17:04.806
that blew up
12 servicemen

17:04.849 --> 17:07.461
in Baghdad.Answer the question,
Petty Officer.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.334
No, I didn't.

17:11.378 --> 17:12.466
Four eagle-eyed sharpshooters,

17:12.509 --> 17:15.034
and not one of them
spotted a gun.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.252
Have you ever questioned

17:16.296 --> 17:17.993
Bravo 1's decision-making
on a mission?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.648
We've all had
our difference of opinions.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.389
But I trust

17:22.432 --> 17:24.695
Master Chief Hayes more
than anyone to get us home.

17:24.739 --> 17:25.957
Has anyone discussed going
"shields up"

17:26.001 --> 17:27.046
to protect your team leader?

17:27.089 --> 17:28.395
No, sir.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.397
No member of Bravo
would stand by

17:30.440 --> 17:32.703
and support a brother
if he committed a war crime.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.923
None of you saw
this elusive gun,

17:34.966 --> 17:38.666
yet you all assert, under oath,
that Chief Hayes is innocent.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.276
If he made that mistake,

17:40.320 --> 17:42.626
he'd own up to it.Really?

17:42.670 --> 17:44.541
Can you name one instance
of Master Chief Hayes

17:44.585 --> 17:46.543
owning up to an error
he made in the field?

17:48.328 --> 17:50.504
Nothing comes to mind.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.380
Teammates painted
a picture of you

17:57.424 --> 17:59.078
as someone who's always in
control on the battlefield.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.383
I'm not sure
they swayed the panel.

18:00.427 --> 18:01.689
Only two members
have seen combat.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.734
The rest of them
don't know what it's like

18:03.778 --> 18:06.433
outside the wire.Which is why Chief
Warrant Officer Perry,

18:06.476 --> 18:08.478
as an officer and operator,
is our best option

18:08.522 --> 18:10.480
to appeal to them.Or the best option

18:10.524 --> 18:12.613
to put the final nail
in my coffin.

Is the government prepared
to proceed?

18:18.401 --> 18:20.099
Yes, Your Honor.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.361
Call your next witness.

18:21.404 --> 18:22.492
The government calls

18:22.536 --> 18:23.537
Chief Warrant Officer
Raymond Perry

18:23.580 --> 18:24.712
to the stand.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.757
â™ª

18:34.200 --> 18:36.898
FLORES:
When did you learn the man you
were hunting was your torturer?

18:36.941 --> 18:38.595
RAY: The night
before the mission.

18:38.639 --> 18:40.815
FLORES:
When did Master Chief
Hayes learn this?

18:40.858 --> 18:42.425
The next morning.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.427
Did Master Chief Hayes
pressure you

18:44.471 --> 18:47.430
into launching an opwithout approval from Jordan?No.

18:47.474 --> 18:50.172
No?

18:50.216 --> 18:52.914
In your deposition, when
asked if Master Chief Hayes

18:52.957 --> 18:55.177
was eager to pursue the
op, you answered yes.

18:55.221 --> 18:58.746
Yes, he wanted to move;
no, he didn't pressure me.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.575
The timeline of events
indicates that

19:01.618 --> 19:03.751
as soon as Master Chief Hayes
knew of your connection

19:03.794 --> 19:06.057
to the mission, the op
was full speed ahead.

19:06.101 --> 19:09.060
Yes, we received time-sensitive
actionable intel that morning.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.585
You're saying the Master Chief's
knowledge of Raqqa Jacques

19:11.628 --> 19:14.327
and the launch of this op
was just a coincidence?

19:14.370 --> 19:15.328
Yes, sir.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.808
Time was of the essence.

19:17.852 --> 19:20.376
How many S.A. missions
have you led as warrant officer?

19:21.464 --> 19:23.118
Two.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.989
FLORES:
You were held captive
for six days and subjected

19:25.033 --> 19:27.427
to extreme physical and
psychological torture.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.732
I'm sure no one
in this courtroom

19:28.776 --> 19:30.169
would blame you for bending

19:30.212 --> 19:31.561
to the will of someone you trust

19:31.605 --> 19:32.693
if they promised you
retribution.

19:32.736 --> 19:33.998
Is that a question, sir?

19:34.042 --> 19:36.392
Must be difficult...
to suddenly act as OIC

19:36.436 --> 19:39.439
to a man you have been
subordinate to for 13 years.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.702
As much as I respect
Master Chief Hayes,

19:41.745 --> 19:44.139
I respect
the chain of command more.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.880
It was my decision

19:45.923 --> 19:47.403
to take the op kinetic.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.013
The mission
was a success,

19:49.057 --> 19:50.276
as was the follow-on.

19:50.319 --> 19:51.668
And for the record...

19:51.712 --> 19:54.105
I killed Raqqa Jacques,

19:54.149 --> 19:55.716
not Jason Hayes.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.507
No further questions.

20:06.596 --> 20:07.945
Your Honor,

20:07.989 --> 20:09.773
given that Chief Warrant Officer
Perry's testimony

20:09.817 --> 20:12.123
nullifies the revenge motive
for murder,

20:12.167 --> 20:14.430
I propose a motion to
dismiss all charges.

20:15.823 --> 20:19.043
I will dismiss the charge
of premeditated murder.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.871
But the members

20:20.915 --> 20:23.222
could still find for
involuntary manslaughter.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.878
The witness may
be excused.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.014
â™ª

20:45.809 --> 20:48.247
Ray had your six
after all.
Mm-hmm.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.379
Losing motive puts a big hole
in the prosecution's case.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.381
But the involuntary
manslaughter,

20:52.425 --> 20:54.818
this boots me
off the team,

20:54.862 --> 20:57.168
gets me ten years.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.258
Still, there's no gun.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.434
Our expert witness will poke
holes in the video evidence.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.262
Expert witness?
You're telling me

21:03.305 --> 21:05.133
I have to rely on
some computer geek

21:05.176 --> 21:07.266
to look for missing
camera angles here?

21:07.309 --> 21:08.354
I mean, even you
said that video

21:08.397 --> 21:09.572
makes me look
like a killer.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.096
I need to tell my
side of the story.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.663
Putting you on the stand
will make us look desperate.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.883
I am desperate.It only took me

21:15.926 --> 21:18.451
three questions to get you
to self-destruct in prep.

21:18.494 --> 21:21.018
Flores is dying to get you on
his turf and push your buttons.

21:21.062 --> 21:23.107
My word should matter.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.761
If you blow up on the stand,

21:24.805 --> 21:26.981
your word will get you sent
away for the rest of your life.

21:28.199 --> 21:30.724
It's my ass on the line, ma'am.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.081
Do you solemnly swear or affirm
that the testimony

21:40.124 --> 21:41.561
you will give in this general
court-martial will be the truth,

21:41.604 --> 21:43.345
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

21:43.389 --> 21:46.000
under penalty of perjury?

21:46.043 --> 21:47.306
I do.

21:47.349 --> 21:48.437
Please be seated.

21:48.481 --> 21:49.525
State your name,

21:49.569 --> 21:50.961
rank and billet.Jason M. Hayes,

21:51.005 --> 21:52.789
Master Chief,
United States Navy.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.748
Navy Special Warfare
Development Group.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.967
Bravo Team Leader.It's your witness.

21:59.187 --> 22:00.928
Master Chief,
walk me through what happened

22:00.971 --> 22:02.538
in Irbid on 11 March.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.235
Bravo Team arrived
on target.

22:04.279 --> 22:07.761
My teammates
observed two men

22:07.804 --> 22:11.199
enter an apartment complex,
one shouldering an AK.

22:11.242 --> 22:13.244
Because they were armed,

22:13.288 --> 22:16.204
we entered the apartment complex
with our pistols drawn.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.467
Surely it was chaos the moment
you entered the building.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.513
How are you able
to recall what happened

22:20.556 --> 22:22.863
during such a kinetic operation?

22:22.906 --> 22:25.039
We're trained to do this.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.780
It's our job.

22:26.823 --> 22:29.478
We remain calm in the chaos.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.654
It's like time slows down.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.308
I led my team
up the stairs.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.918
I was the tip of the spear.
I rounded a corner.

22:34.962 --> 22:37.181
I looked up, I saw a male--

22:37.225 --> 22:39.270
black hair, track jacket.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.098
Had a gun on his side
in his left hand.

22:41.142 --> 22:44.058
It was a Beretta M1951.

22:44.101 --> 22:47.453
Before he could alert
the others, I shot him.

22:48.541 --> 22:52.022
I continued into the target,
and I completed my duty.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.894
No further questions.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.069
Is there cross-examination?

22:55.112 --> 22:56.766
Yes, Your Honor.

22:58.551 --> 22:59.987
So, Master Chief Hayes,
your duty,

23:00.030 --> 23:01.641
as you put it,
is to kill people?

23:01.684 --> 23:03.251
You got that backwards.

23:03.294 --> 23:06.210
My job is to save lives,
not take them.

23:06.254 --> 23:09.736
Like the hundreds of innocent
people that Bravo Team saved

23:09.779 --> 23:11.694
by stopping AKM terrorists

23:11.738 --> 23:12.956
from taking out
two commercial airliners.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.218
Speaking of
innocent people,

23:14.262 --> 23:15.916
I'd like to concentrate
on the very real,

23:15.959 --> 23:18.658
and very dead, unarmed
Jordanian citizen, Mr. Nafal.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.486
Is he the first unarmed man
you've killed?

23:20.529 --> 23:21.617
Objection.

23:21.661 --> 23:22.662
Sustained.

23:22.705 --> 23:23.706
How many people have you killed?

23:23.750 --> 23:24.707
That's not something
I think about.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.666
Is that because
after 20 years

23:26.709 --> 23:27.710
you've become
indifferent to killing?

23:27.754 --> 23:28.711
It's because
I know what it means

23:28.755 --> 23:29.843
to take a human life.

23:29.886 --> 23:32.411
Chief Warrant Officer Perry
testified

23:32.454 --> 23:34.413
that you learned
of the HVT's identity

23:34.456 --> 23:36.197
a few hours
before the Irbid op.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.329
That's correct.

23:38.373 --> 23:40.897
You rescued Warrant Officer
Perry from his torture chamber.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.117
You witnessed his ordeal,

23:43.160 --> 23:44.466
and his condition,
first hand?

23:44.510 --> 23:45.641
I did.

23:45.685 --> 23:47.774
That must have been difficult.

23:47.817 --> 23:50.298
If I had been in your position,
I would absolutely want justice

23:50.341 --> 23:51.560
for what was done
to my best friend.

23:51.604 --> 23:52.779
With all due respect, sir,

23:52.822 --> 23:54.128
you've never been
in my position.

23:54.171 --> 23:56.217
Are you telling me
this bombshell about the HVT

23:56.260 --> 23:57.784
didn't cause you to conflate
your personal feelings

23:57.827 --> 23:58.915
and your professional duty?

23:58.959 --> 24:01.048
It's always personal.

24:01.091 --> 24:02.441
The war on
terror started

24:02.484 --> 24:04.399
when 3,000
of our fellow Americans

24:04.443 --> 24:06.749
were killed on our own soil.

24:06.793 --> 24:08.490
They hit us,

24:08.534 --> 24:10.100
so we hit them back.

24:10.144 --> 24:12.146
There's nothing impersonal
about it.So you're admitting

24:12.189 --> 24:13.277
emotion clouded your judgment

24:13.321 --> 24:14.409
and led you to kill
an unarmed man?

24:14.453 --> 24:16.324
Mr. Nafal had a gun.

24:16.367 --> 24:18.631
Clearly a man willing to
compromise his morals to kill

24:18.674 --> 24:20.067
must be willing to lie, too.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.068
Objection.

24:21.111 --> 24:22.504
Overruled.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.463
Answer the question,
Master Chief.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.989
The war on terror has come
at a heavy price.

24:29.032 --> 24:31.600
It's cost me my family,

24:31.644 --> 24:34.124
my teammates, my marriage,

24:34.168 --> 24:37.432
seeing my kids grow up.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.739
But the one thing
that it hasn't taken from me

24:39.782 --> 24:42.829
is my honor and my word.

24:42.872 --> 24:47.355
I wouldn't disrespect
the Trident to protect myself.

24:47.398 --> 24:50.445
Lying would be
a betrayal to my men

24:50.489 --> 24:53.361
and the country I love to serve.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.321
I only have one more question.

24:57.365 --> 24:59.149
Master Chief Hayes...

25:01.108 --> 25:02.892
...where's the gun?

25:03.893 --> 25:06.113
â™ª

25:09.551 --> 25:11.118
Hey.

25:11.161 --> 25:13.033
Ain't you a sight
for sore eyes?

25:13.076 --> 25:15.339
Well, right back at you,
sailor.
Yeah.

25:18.691 --> 25:20.388
This damn trial.

25:20.431 --> 25:23.260
Uh, it's bad enough that
they're stringing up Jace

25:23.304 --> 25:25.698
for some BS and...

25:25.741 --> 25:28.744
you and I got to
tiptoe around all...

25:28.788 --> 25:31.399
these extra eyeballs on Bravo.Yeah.

25:31.442 --> 25:33.880
None of this is easy.WOMAN:
Hey.

25:33.923 --> 25:35.534
I, uh...

25:35.577 --> 25:38.449
[chuckles]:I just really wish we could go
back to normal.

25:38.493 --> 25:40.277
Normal?

25:41.278 --> 25:43.280
So, how did it go in court?

25:43.324 --> 25:44.630
Oh, it was all a joke.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.109
They kept picking apart
every minute of the day

25:46.153 --> 25:47.546
leading up to the op.

25:47.589 --> 25:48.982
Hardly anything
that really matters.

25:50.070 --> 25:52.289
Ah, maybe we should be
doing that.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.465
What?I mean,
maybe we've been

25:54.509 --> 25:56.424
so focused on the day
of the shooting

25:56.467 --> 25:58.861
that we've been missing
the whole picture.

26:01.385 --> 26:02.909
I got to head back
to the office.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.301
Uh, I'm s...
Don't wait up.

26:04.345 --> 26:05.999
No. Oh.
Sorry.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.131
You're killing me.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.393
Literally.

26:10.438 --> 26:11.961
What's this?

26:12.005 --> 26:13.659
I'm making linguini.
Ha!

26:13.702 --> 26:15.356
'Guini, my favorite.

26:15.399 --> 26:17.010
Don't get your hopes up.

26:17.053 --> 26:19.316
I haven't perfected
the parmesan-to-butter ratio

26:19.360 --> 26:20.666
like Mom did.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.929
Mom's recipe, too, huh?Yeah.

26:22.972 --> 26:24.452
Ah, that's
a good last supper to have.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.715
It's not funny.It's a little funny,

26:26.759 --> 26:28.630
don't you think?
I think it's funny.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.893
JAG Williams called and said
Uncle Ray and your testimony

26:30.937 --> 26:33.156
made a big dent
in the prosecution's case.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.810
Still have that,
uh, video evidence.

26:34.854 --> 26:36.812
And it's my word
against theirs, so...

26:36.856 --> 26:39.119
Mm-hmm.
[sighs]

26:40.163 --> 26:42.296
I just want you to know that,
you know, I did the right thing.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.386
Never doubted that for a second.

26:50.173 --> 26:53.046
Em?
Hmm?

26:53.089 --> 26:54.656
You know, if I do go away,
you-you're gonna have to be

26:54.700 --> 26:57.485
Mikey's guardian.No, we're not thinking
about that.

26:57.528 --> 26:59.661
I know that
it's difficult

26:59.705 --> 27:01.794
to talk about these
times of things, Em.
Mm.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.752
I-I... That I get,

27:03.796 --> 27:05.667
but you know what,
you're...

27:05.711 --> 27:07.800
Okay.Come on, you're gonna be
able to handle this, okay?

27:07.843 --> 27:09.889
Handle you going to jail? How?

27:09.932 --> 27:11.673
Look, you're a strong,
young woman.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.240
You know what, you kept
this family together.

27:13.283 --> 27:14.241
after Mom.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.851
Okay.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.636
You've always been able to
manage without having me around

27:17.679 --> 27:18.985
most of your life.

27:19.028 --> 27:20.421
You-you kept the family
together.

27:20.464 --> 27:21.596
Why do you always
do that?

27:21.640 --> 27:22.728
What?

27:22.771 --> 27:24.381
Acting like
the only value you have is

27:24.425 --> 27:26.296
to your team
on the battlefield.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.385
I don't care what you think.

27:28.429 --> 27:29.865
You're the only parent
I have left.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.040
I'm always gonna need you.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.302
Look, I'm sorry.

27:32.346 --> 27:33.652
Hey.

27:33.695 --> 27:34.870
[softly]:They can't take you away
from me.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.698
[chuckles]:
They're not. Don't. Hey.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.482
Hey. Shh.

27:38.526 --> 27:40.223
[sobbing softly]

27:40.267 --> 27:41.834
They won't.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.669
[sighs]

27:54.150 --> 27:56.152
â™ª

28:00.113 --> 28:02.115
[exhales]

28:07.642 --> 28:09.644
[clicking slowly]

28:19.001 --> 28:20.307
[sets mug down]

28:25.660 --> 28:27.662
[line rings]

28:27.706 --> 28:29.359
Lt. Commander Williams,

28:29.403 --> 28:30.752
I'm sorry to be calling you
so early.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.754
â™ª

28:33.973 --> 28:36.149
This photo of Yazeed
Nafal was taken

28:36.192 --> 28:39.065
by Chief Petty Officer
Mina Hassan in Irbid, Jordan,

28:39.108 --> 28:41.894
48 hours before he was shot
by Master Chief Hayes.

28:41.937 --> 28:43.765
There is a gun tucked
into Nafal's waistband

28:43.809 --> 28:45.027
on the left side.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.856
The grip is consistent
with an M1951 Beretta.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.553
The gun described
by Master Chief Hayes.

28:49.597 --> 28:51.599
Yes, ma'am, the very same.

28:53.906 --> 28:56.038
FLORES:
What matters is the evidence.

28:56.082 --> 28:58.432
A video of Master Chief Hayes
shooting an unarmed man

28:58.475 --> 28:59.868
without provocation.

28:59.912 --> 29:02.871
The defense provided
a partial image of the grip

29:02.915 --> 29:05.352
of a pistol from two days
before the killing.

29:05.395 --> 29:07.702
This is purely circumstantial
and cannot put a gun

29:07.746 --> 29:09.660
in the victim's hand
at the time of his death.

29:09.704 --> 29:12.011
The government asks
that you find the accused

29:12.054 --> 29:13.752
guilty as charged.

29:18.582 --> 29:21.150
Lieutenant Commander Williams.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.029
You've seen the photo
of the gun.

29:30.072 --> 29:32.422
You've heard the testimony
of the sailors

29:32.466 --> 29:35.208
who stood alongside
Master Chief Hayes,

29:35.251 --> 29:38.951
who applaud his good standing
and honorable reputation.

29:38.994 --> 29:41.127
And you've heard
the sworn statement

29:41.170 --> 29:42.955
of Master Chief Hayes himself.

29:42.998 --> 29:44.173
Master Chief Hayes,

29:44.217 --> 29:45.958
in many ways,

29:46.001 --> 29:49.439
is the embodiment
of the war on terror.

29:49.483 --> 29:52.007
For over 20 years he's run
into the fire for his country.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.575
While the prosecution
has gone to great lengths

29:54.618 --> 29:56.707
to portray Master Chief Hayes
as a killer,

29:56.751 --> 29:58.361
I've learned--

29:58.405 --> 30:00.799
and I hope you have, too--

30:00.842 --> 30:03.279
that Master Chief Hayes
doesn't do his job

30:03.323 --> 30:05.238
to shoot the enemy
in front of him.

30:05.281 --> 30:08.023
He does it to protect
the people behind him.

30:08.067 --> 30:11.244
Not just his teammates
but his countrymen.

30:11.287 --> 30:13.724
And despite all he's sacrificed

30:13.768 --> 30:16.858
and the deep, personal price
he's paid,

30:16.902 --> 30:20.601
Master Chief Hayes has never
asked for anything in return.

30:20.644 --> 30:22.777
So I'll ask for him.

30:22.821 --> 30:27.303
If you're willing to trust
him with your freedom,

30:27.347 --> 30:30.524
please also trust his word.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.705
â™ª

30:44.712 --> 30:46.714
â™ª

30:53.939 --> 30:55.723
Has the panel reached a verdict?

30:56.942 --> 30:58.073
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

31:07.909 --> 31:10.651
We find the defendant,
Master Chief Jason M. Hayes...

31:11.695 --> 31:13.610
...not guilty.

31:15.656 --> 31:16.962
Thank you.

31:17.005 --> 31:20.095
It was my honor, Master Chief.

31:30.714 --> 31:33.065
There you go.
Thank you.

31:33.108 --> 31:34.893
SONNY:
Oh, what we got here?

31:34.936 --> 31:36.024
[chuckles]Hey now.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.808
NAIMA:All hail
the conquering hero.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.549
Hey, how are you?Mm.

31:39.593 --> 31:41.551
Thank you. You didn't have
to do all this, you know.

31:41.595 --> 31:42.988
All you been through?

31:43.031 --> 31:44.598
Couldn't get the champagne
on ice fast enough.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.469
JAG Flores found
out what happens

31:46.513 --> 31:48.210
when you mess
with the great Jason Hayes, huh?

31:48.254 --> 31:49.864
Thanks, man,
appreciate you all.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.474
I really do.
Thanks for, uh, being there

31:51.518 --> 31:53.694
and standing by me
with the support.

31:53.737 --> 31:55.348
All of you, thanks.

31:55.391 --> 31:56.523
Thank you.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.046
RAY:
Bravo 1.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.267
Welcome back.

32:03.051 --> 32:05.271
[laughter]

32:05.314 --> 32:07.099
Love you, brother, hey.Love you back.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.492
Appreciate you, I really do.

32:09.536 --> 32:11.320
Thanks for what you did
up there on the stand.

32:11.364 --> 32:12.974
All I did was tell the truth.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.541
Yeah, but...

32:14.584 --> 32:15.934
going kinetic.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.284
Maybe I did pusha little too hard.
Mm.

32:18.327 --> 32:19.938
I was the OIC.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.591
You didn't make me do anything
I didn't want to.

32:21.635 --> 32:23.680
Okay.

32:23.724 --> 32:25.552
Chief Warrant Officer Perry.

32:25.595 --> 32:28.424
[chuckles] I'm just glad
the truth finally prevailed.

32:29.730 --> 32:32.254
Not sure I could've kept on
without you.

32:33.734 --> 32:35.214
Good thing
I'm not going anywhere.

32:35.257 --> 32:37.042
[bottles clank]

32:37.085 --> 32:39.914
Mm.
Hey, where's Stella?

32:39.958 --> 32:42.047
She, uh, she had a lot
of papers to grade.
Mm.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.353
Look, man.

32:44.397 --> 32:46.486
The way I handled everything...

32:46.529 --> 32:47.966
No worries, man.

32:48.009 --> 32:49.619
You were just looking
after your team leader here.

32:49.663 --> 32:51.447
Shouldn't have doubted you.

32:51.491 --> 32:53.754
Just, uh, Jason in
DoD's crosshairs,

32:53.797 --> 32:55.799
I lost track of... everything

32:55.843 --> 32:57.845
that you've been through
these last few months, too.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.890
JASON:
It's been a tough go

32:59.934 --> 33:02.023
for Bravo Team
since we got back from Tunisia.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.721
Yeah, I'm just glad
it's behind us.

33:04.765 --> 33:06.375
All of it.That's right.

33:06.419 --> 33:09.465
Hey, uh, not to upstage...

33:09.509 --> 33:12.207
Bravo 1 here, but, uh, I, uh,

33:12.251 --> 33:14.775
I got some big news myself.

33:14.818 --> 33:16.385
The McRib's back already?

33:16.429 --> 33:18.039
[laughter]

33:19.649 --> 33:22.391
Uh... I'm gonna be a dad.

33:22.435 --> 33:23.784
What?

33:23.827 --> 33:25.481
Yeah.

33:26.961 --> 33:28.571
JASON:
Sonny Quinn's gonna be

33:28.615 --> 33:30.747
a dad...Wait, uh, who's the lucky lady?

33:30.791 --> 33:32.706
And what time does
she get off stage?

33:32.749 --> 33:35.187
The mother, um,

33:35.230 --> 33:36.623
is an old friend of mine
from Texas.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.059
But, uh, we're not together.

33:38.103 --> 33:39.800
Why not?

33:39.843 --> 33:42.716
It's, uh, it's complicated.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.631
CLAY:
Look, I think, uh,

33:44.674 --> 33:47.025
I think we're long overduefor a toast here, huh?Yeah.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.548
Yeah.

33:48.591 --> 33:50.898
Come on, babe.
Get in there.

33:50.941 --> 33:53.074
Get in there.Get 'em altogether now.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.554
[all exclaim]

33:54.597 --> 33:56.382
To freedom.Freedom!

33:56.425 --> 33:58.514
ALL:
Freedom!

33:58.558 --> 34:00.734
All right, all right, so...

34:00.777 --> 34:03.476
what does a lawyer get
when you give him Viagra?

34:03.519 --> 34:05.304
What?
Taller.

34:05.347 --> 34:07.045
[laughter]

34:07.088 --> 34:08.785
That's all I got,
that's all I got.

34:08.829 --> 34:10.309
Maybe Ray should take some.

34:10.352 --> 34:11.919
Ooh, burn!

34:11.962 --> 34:13.399
CLAY:Did you guys see
the look on the JAG's face

34:13.442 --> 34:14.530
when they announced
the verdict?

34:14.574 --> 34:16.706
Douche thought
he had a career-maker.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.969
Seriously, man, baiting us
with those questions

34:19.013 --> 34:20.623
about Raqqa Jacques?

34:20.667 --> 34:22.669
Come on, like this, like this
was some sort of revenge

34:22.712 --> 34:24.801
mission for Ray's torture.

34:24.845 --> 34:26.760
BROCK:Like we need a reason
to go after a terrorist.

34:26.803 --> 34:29.023
TRENT:
Uh, yeah, like, uh, hello?

34:29.067 --> 34:31.765
That's our job.

34:35.290 --> 34:37.684
SONNY:
Hey.

34:37.727 --> 34:39.860
Why aren't you inside?

34:39.903 --> 34:42.036
It's a party, not a
wake, because of you.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.125
Not really in the mood.

34:44.169 --> 34:46.649
Um, I saw Lindell
after the verdict.

34:46.693 --> 34:48.347
And...

34:48.390 --> 34:51.698
...I didn't get
the job with Echo.
What?

34:51.741 --> 34:54.092
[stammers]
But you're a shoo-in.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.311
Yeah, because of the
investigation into Bravo,

34:56.355 --> 34:58.400
command didn't even
consider my application.

34:58.444 --> 35:00.446
You're kidding me.

35:01.708 --> 35:03.231
I mean, the trial's over.

35:03.275 --> 35:05.015
Jason was acquitted.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.974
Yeah, detailer said
there's not

35:07.017 --> 35:08.671
gonna be another position
open with DEVGRU

35:08.715 --> 35:11.152
anytime soon.

35:11.196 --> 35:13.807
I'm stuck with Bravo.

35:13.850 --> 35:15.852
I'm sorry.

35:17.158 --> 35:19.160
So we're back

35:19.204 --> 35:22.294
to where we were
a year ago, huh?

35:22.337 --> 35:24.296
[phone chimes]

35:24.339 --> 35:26.341
Oh... it's Hannah.

35:26.385 --> 35:28.648
She-she had a...

35:28.691 --> 35:30.693
a doc-- um...

35:30.737 --> 35:32.869
Uh, doesn't matter.

35:32.913 --> 35:35.394
It's not exactly where we were
a year ago. [scoffs]

35:36.395 --> 35:38.005
Yeah.

35:39.006 --> 35:40.921
[both exhale]

35:43.706 --> 35:46.187
Is this another sign?

35:53.977 --> 35:56.676
Seems, you know...

35:56.719 --> 35:59.722
no matter how hard we try,

35:59.766 --> 36:02.464
the stars, they...

36:02.508 --> 36:05.075
they just don't align.

36:07.469 --> 36:10.298
Mm. When I was
back in Texas,

36:10.342 --> 36:13.432
everyone mistook Hannah
and I as a couple.

36:14.737 --> 36:17.218
And here...

36:17.262 --> 36:20.308
nobody's allowed
to know what we have.

36:22.789 --> 36:24.921
[whispers]:
That's not fair.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.708
No, it's not.

36:31.841 --> 36:33.452
[shuddering]

36:33.495 --> 36:36.498
I don't know how to fix this.

36:42.330 --> 36:46.291
You know, if I had a nickel
for every damn obstacle

36:46.334 --> 36:48.336
that was thrown in our way...

36:48.380 --> 36:51.600
I think you just...

36:51.644 --> 36:55.256
get to a point where
there's more reasons to break up

36:55.300 --> 36:57.215
than stay together.

37:00.087 --> 37:02.045
[sniffles]

37:02.089 --> 37:04.222
[exhales]

37:04.265 --> 37:06.224
[sniffles][whispers]: Yeah.

37:06.267 --> 37:09.314
â™ª

37:09.357 --> 37:10.619
[door closes]

37:10.663 --> 37:12.230
[exhales]

37:15.407 --> 37:16.973
[sniffs]

37:22.936 --> 37:24.285
Hey.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.983
Like what you've done
with the place.

37:27.027 --> 37:28.289
Oh. Yeah.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.726
Sorry I changed
so much without you.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.641
I was...

37:32.685 --> 37:34.077
I was feeling motivated.

37:34.121 --> 37:35.644
No, it looks good.

37:35.688 --> 37:38.256
I'm glad that you approve.

37:39.692 --> 37:41.302
Except for one thing.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.825
What?

37:42.869 --> 37:45.045
What...

37:45.088 --> 37:48.309
Uh, you don't need
to do that for me.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.746
I know. It's for me, too.

37:52.748 --> 37:54.184
Bravo doesn't need
to loom over us

37:54.228 --> 37:56.186
all the time.

37:56.230 --> 37:58.101
[sniffs]

38:00.539 --> 38:02.236
[chuckles softly]

38:05.413 --> 38:08.024
This is our place.

38:08.068 --> 38:09.417
Only for us.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.201
Okay.

38:12.507 --> 38:13.552
[grunting]

38:16.294 --> 38:18.121
Mmm.

38:19.558 --> 38:21.734
[sighs contentedly][exhales]

38:23.605 --> 38:25.738
[sighs]

38:25.781 --> 38:27.957
[grunts]

38:28.001 --> 38:31.396
You know, babe, we should've
just got a keg. [chuckles]

38:32.832 --> 38:34.224
[exhales]

38:34.268 --> 38:36.488
I overheard
what they were saying.

38:37.532 --> 38:38.838
About the
trial being

38:38.881 --> 38:40.970
about going after the person
who tortured you.

38:42.015 --> 38:44.496
Some revenge mission.

38:44.539 --> 38:47.020
[chuckles softly]
Jason was found innocent, babe.

38:47.063 --> 38:49.152
That's not what happened.

38:49.196 --> 38:50.676
Do you know how small
it makes me feel

38:50.719 --> 38:53.113
hearing what
you've kept from me?

38:53.156 --> 38:55.724
You said Jordan was
just another op.

38:55.768 --> 38:57.944
I thought we
shared everything.

38:57.987 --> 39:00.076
[exhales]
I was protecting you, baby.

39:00.120 --> 39:03.166
Building a wall between us
doesn't protect me.

39:03.210 --> 39:06.344
It isolates you
from this family.

39:08.084 --> 39:11.218
Look, I'm...[grunts, exhales]

39:11.261 --> 39:12.524
I'm here for you.

39:12.567 --> 39:14.482
Why won't you let me in?

39:14.526 --> 39:16.136
[exhales softly]

39:20.923 --> 39:23.926
This is not how
our marriage works.

39:25.537 --> 39:27.190
[sniffles]

39:27.234 --> 39:30.193
â™ª

39:30.237 --> 39:32.195
[whines]

39:34.633 --> 39:35.590
[door closes]

39:35.634 --> 39:36.939
Hey.

39:36.983 --> 39:39.028
You know,
you could've stayed at the party

39:39.072 --> 39:41.422
just a little bit longer
with your old man.

39:41.466 --> 39:42.858
Mm, you needed to be
with your brothers,

39:42.902 --> 39:45.252
and I figured things
were gonna get a little rowdy

39:45.295 --> 39:46.558
given they have
their leader back.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.821
Well, real celebration
is, uh, being able

39:48.864 --> 39:51.563
to talk to you
with no bars in between us.

39:51.606 --> 39:52.825
Mm.

39:52.868 --> 39:54.435
I'm glad you came.
I really am.

39:54.479 --> 39:57.743
But I can, uh, handle things
from here on out now.

39:57.786 --> 39:59.092
Of course you can.

39:59.135 --> 40:00.833
You're the strongest person
I know.

40:00.876 --> 40:02.835
I'm just glad that you
weren't in that courtroom

40:02.878 --> 40:06.229
to hear all the horrible things
that Flores had to say about me.

40:06.273 --> 40:08.362
He was saying
whatever it took to win,

40:08.406 --> 40:09.668
fighting dirty.

40:09.711 --> 40:11.539
Yeah.

40:11.583 --> 40:14.847
Always tried my best not to
bring the war back home with me.

40:14.890 --> 40:17.284
Mm-hmm.But, uh...

40:17.327 --> 40:19.199
this one was tough.

40:19.242 --> 40:21.375
It stirred something
up inside of me,

40:21.419 --> 40:24.073
just the horrors...

40:24.117 --> 40:26.206
that I've seen and...

40:26.249 --> 40:27.599
things that I've done.

40:27.642 --> 40:29.775
You're not a war criminal, Dad.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.516
I'm not a hero, either.

40:31.559 --> 40:33.953
Don't need a jury
to tell me that.

40:33.996 --> 40:35.650
You are to me.

40:37.652 --> 40:40.350
And I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

40:41.395 --> 40:43.615
Even though
you're not facing sentencing,

40:43.658 --> 40:46.226
you should still see
this "good sailor" book.

40:46.269 --> 40:47.662
Ah, the book.[chuckles]Yeah.

40:47.706 --> 40:48.837
Want me to read a letter?

40:48.881 --> 40:50.578
I love when you read to me.Oh.

40:50.622 --> 40:52.058
Sure.

40:53.538 --> 40:54.974
"I had the distinct honor

40:55.017 --> 40:57.455
"of serving alongside Master
Chief Hayes for two years.

40:57.498 --> 40:59.587
"His leadership in the
field is second to none,

40:59.631 --> 41:01.154
"and I have never
known an operator

41:01.197 --> 41:03.069
more committed
to Navy."

41:03.112 --> 41:06.551
That's from someone
named Theo Papadakis.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.032
[scoffs softly]

41:10.076 --> 41:11.904
Theo.

41:13.340 --> 41:15.298
That's a blast from the past.
[grunts softly]

41:15.342 --> 41:17.910
I don't remember you
ever mentioning him.

41:19.433 --> 41:21.740
Yeah. Well, you know,
you were...

41:22.784 --> 41:24.438
You were
in your poo-poo diapers.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.571
How old do you think I am?

41:26.614 --> 41:28.094
He writes he got out
eight years ago.

41:28.137 --> 41:29.182
You were young.

41:29.225 --> 41:31.184
He got an injury and...

41:31.227 --> 41:33.273
left Bravo Team. I...

41:33.316 --> 41:34.840
I haven't seen him since.

41:34.883 --> 41:36.450
Doesn't seem to have
changed his mind

41:36.494 --> 41:37.799
about what kind of man you are.

41:39.366 --> 41:40.410
[quietly]:
Yeah.

41:40.454 --> 41:42.456
[insects trilling]

41:59.865 --> 42:01.780
