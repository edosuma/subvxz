I want to know who

00:15.281 --> 00:17.117
You don't normally need help
with stuff like that.

00:17.183 --> 00:18.485
My computer's down.

00:18.551 --> 00:20.286
I have a close friend

00:20.353 --> 00:20.987
who I can't help.

They're releasing him.

excited. There are conditions.

that's if I even want
to go to college.

I mean, a degree isn't
the only path to success.

01:29.355 --> 01:30.723
none of them graduated college.

Morning, Mom.

01:34.861 --> 01:36.663
Dee, you were always so excited

01:36.729 --> 01:37.764
about going
to college.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.099
I know. Well, maybe I'm just...

01:40.166 --> 01:42.235
exploring
different perspectives.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.404
Yeah, well,
from my perspective,

01:44.471 --> 01:45.839
you're going to college.

01:45.905 --> 01:47.307
Okay, we still have
a couple years

01:47.373 --> 01:49.809
before I'm old...

01:47.373 --> 01:49.809
You leave for college, yes.

01:50.677 --> 01:51.811
Okay.

01:51.878 --> 01:54.447
I got to go
meet Tiffany.

01:54.514 --> 01:55.849
A bunch of us
are going skating at Wolman's.

01:55.915 --> 01:57.717
But I love you.

01:57.784 --> 01:58.718
Bye.

that's coming from?

02:01.488 --> 02:03.356

02:03.423 --> 02:05.725
Sometimes I think she just says
things to see how we'll react.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.794
I swear, man.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.263
I got to skate out
of here, too, Aunt Vi.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.132
All right.
Right behind you.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.803

Mm-hmm.

Upstairs,

02:19.973 --> 02:22.642
in the light of day.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.344
How's it feel?

02:24.410 --> 02:26.246
I think it'd feel a little
better if the, uh, FBI hadn't

02:26.312 --> 02:28.281
repossessed my safe
space and banned me

02:28.348 --> 02:30.750
from doing the only thing
which gives my life meaning.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.285
At least you're
not in prison, babe.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.888
And you don't have to pretend
to be dead.

02:34.954 --> 02:36.456
Like you wanted.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.191
I know, I know. (stammers)
Don't get me wrong--

02:38.258 --> 02:41.461
it is amazing
being out in the world again.

02:41.528 --> 02:42.929
Except
for those electric scooters.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.931
Who authorized
those death traps?

02:45.932 --> 02:49.569
But what's the point of
gaining the world if it means

02:49.636 --> 02:51.471
losing your place in it?

02:51.538 --> 02:53.573
We'll find your place.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.841
I promise.

02:54.908 --> 02:55.942
Yeah.

02:54.908 --> 02:55.942
But that's not

02:56.009 --> 02:57.911
why we called.
We got a message

02:57.977 --> 03:00.213
from Deidre Blickman.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.382
The wife of the rapper, Dilemma?

03:02.448 --> 03:03.550
That's the one.

03:03.616 --> 03:06.753
The guy gunned down his rival,
Dre Bids, in cold blood

03:06.819 --> 03:08.922
as part of a rap beef.

03:08.988 --> 03:10.590
Yeah, I know who he is.

03:10.657 --> 03:11.691
What does the wife want?

03:11.758 --> 03:13.326
She says he didn't do it.

03:13.393 --> 03:14.694
Well, I thought he confessed.

03:14.761 --> 03:17.497
He did. But she says she has
proof that it wasn't him.

03:37.517 --> 03:39.619
Those details
were never released publicly.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.688
This song is
a confession.

03:41.754 --> 03:45.491
So you think whoever recorded
this track killed Dre Bids,

03:45.558 --> 03:46.292
not your husband.

03:46.359 --> 03:48.261
I never believed
Greg's confession.

03:48.328 --> 03:49.696
Now I know I was right.

03:49.762 --> 03:50.730
Who's the artist?

03:50.797 --> 03:52.332
He goes by the name Sid Slay.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.267
The track dropped on SoundCloud
just about a month ago.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.803
We tried to find him,
but his account's anonymous.

03:56.869 --> 03:59.372
What does your husband
have to say about this?

03:59.439 --> 04:00.740
Told me to leave it alone.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.508
But we've been married
a long time.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.376
I know

04:03.443 --> 04:04.844
when he's keeping
something from me.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.313
My dad's not a murderer.

04:08.214 --> 04:11.351
I'm not sure if you take cases
from people like me,

04:11.417 --> 04:12.819
but I don't know where to turn.

04:12.885 --> 04:15.021
Something's
not right.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.657
I just need someone
who can tell me the truth.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.926
(chuckles) Come on, Ma.
We know the truth.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.661
He did it.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.661
Shut up!

04:21.728 --> 04:23.396
Watch your mouth, Daoud.

04:23.463 --> 04:24.998
Just speaking the truth, Ma.

04:25.064 --> 04:26.933
Shotta Boys jumped me.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.334
Dad set it right.

04:28.401 --> 04:29.135
Daoud,

04:29.202 --> 04:30.637
take your brother
to his art class

04:30.703 --> 04:31.838
and pick him up after.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.406
Yo, you can't just call him
an Uber?

04:33.473 --> 04:34.507
I got somewhere to be.

04:34.574 --> 04:37.543
Take your brother
to his class.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.678
Now.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.414
Get your stuff, Nasir.

04:47.053 --> 04:48.021
Bye, Ma.

04:48.087 --> 04:49.288
It was nice
meeting you.

04:49.355 --> 04:50.390
(door closes)

04:50.456 --> 04:52.625
(sighs) You have
to forgive Daoud.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.627
All his life, he wanted
to be like his father.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.496
Started rapping
when he was eight years old.

04:56.562 --> 04:59.766
He's been in so much pain ever
since his dad went to prison.

04:59.832 --> 05:01.334
He became hard.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.069
Started running the streets.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.738
Trying to take up the mantle?

05:05.805 --> 05:07.440
My husband's gangsta image
sold a lot of records,

05:07.507 --> 05:08.775
but that's not who he is.

05:08.841 --> 05:10.410
Is that so?

05:10.476 --> 05:11.844
Because from what I read,
even before the murder,

05:11.911 --> 05:14.047
things were getting violent
between the two crews.

05:14.113 --> 05:15.915
Joke is...

05:15.982 --> 05:20.420
whole damn beef started out
as a PR stunt to sell tracks.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.688
It just got so out of hand,

05:21.754 --> 05:23.923
with them trying to be
what they rapped about.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.060
Last year, Dre Bids' gang,
the Shotta Boys,

05:27.126 --> 05:31.064
beat Daoud up so badly
he had to be hospitalized.

05:31.130 --> 05:34.367
My husband's crew
wanted revenge, but...

05:34.434 --> 05:37.770
he saw what the music was doing.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.374
He just wanted to be done
with the violence.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.477
That's how I know it wasn't him.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.379
If your husband is innocent,

05:46.446 --> 05:48.448
he confessed for a reason.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.383
He must be covering
for something.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.452
I know what you're thinking,

05:52.518 --> 05:53.820
but Nasir was home with me

05:53.886 --> 05:56.956
and Daoud and his boys
were at Club Cypher.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.691
If Greg's covering,

05:58.758 --> 06:00.760
it's for someone else--

06:00.827 --> 06:02.562
this Sid Slay--

06:02.628 --> 06:04.564
and I need to know why.

06:06.733 --> 06:07.834
Your client's right.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.503
Those details about the murder
were never made public.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.572
So how'd they wind up
in that SoundCloud track?

06:12.638 --> 06:14.507
Does it matter?
Dilemma confessed.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.109
It matters
if he isn't the real killer.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.911
I thought we were
all about the truth.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.911
You want the truth?

06:18.978 --> 06:21.514
How about the toll their beef
has taken on the community?

06:21.581 --> 06:23.116
How about the ten-year-old girl
who got killed

06:23.182 --> 06:24.984
in the crossfire of a shoot-out

06:25.051 --> 06:26.419
between Shotta Boys and B-Set,

06:26.486 --> 06:28.988
all because Dilemma
killed Dre Bids?

06:29.055 --> 06:30.123
And what if he didn't?

06:30.189 --> 06:31.424
Imagine what that would change.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.126
Why confess if he didn't do it?

06:33.192 --> 06:34.527
That's what I want to ask him.

06:34.594 --> 06:35.995
You think
you can arrange a visit?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.130
I can.

06:37.196 --> 06:38.464
But I'm coming along.

06:38.531 --> 06:39.799
I'll meet you there.

06:39.866 --> 06:42.735
In the meantime,
I'll track down this Sid Slay,

06:42.802 --> 06:46.405
find out how he has details
only the real killer could know.

06:47.774 --> 06:50.076
Okay, so you want me
to trace the IP

06:50.143 --> 06:51.611
of whoever it is
that dropped that track?

06:51.677 --> 06:53.613
I would love to.
Oh! Wait, that's right--

06:53.679 --> 06:56.449
the FBI forbade me from
ever using a computer again.

06:56.516 --> 06:58.718
(grunts) Rob, if anyone
were to see me...

06:58.785 --> 07:00.620
You can't touch a computer,
but Mel can.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.488
Why don't you walk her through
it? That's technically legal.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.891
Yeah. Legal, uh, yeah.

07:04.957 --> 07:06.492
Uh, a good idea? Eh.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.060
I mean, you want us
to stay married, right?

07:08.127 --> 07:11.464
I mean, between her control
issues and my control issues...

07:11.531 --> 07:12.899
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:12.965 --> 07:14.467
We would murder each other.

07:14.534 --> 07:15.868
Can you at least try?

07:16.636 --> 07:19.939
I guess it's got to be better
than being completely useless.

07:20.006 --> 07:22.208
Um, want to give it a shot?

07:24.777 --> 07:25.845
Uh, yeah.

07:27.079 --> 07:28.047
I'll go get

07:47.066 --> 07:50.937

murder you're serving time for.

07:51.003 --> 07:53.172
With details only someone
at the scene would have.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.208

was Cordell Marshall,

11:44.837 --> 11:46.405
Uh... (sighs)
Either we do this now

11:46.472 --> 11:48.140
or we produce it
without him.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.276
All I know is I wouldn't want
to be the person who tells him

11:50.342 --> 11:54.046
he wasn't included in

BRAWLAH:
He was the best to ever do it.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.986
And when Dre Bids took me
under his wing, it was like...

12:01.053 --> 12:03.022
being drafted into the NBA.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.091
I know his death
must have been painful for you.

12:05.157 --> 12:08.060
But can you take me
through that night?

12:08.127 --> 12:09.929
I got a text from him earlier.

12:10.529 --> 12:11.831
He thought something
might be poppin' off

12:11.897 --> 12:13.065
at the studio that night.

12:13.132 --> 12:14.800
But by the time
I got there, I...

12:14.867 --> 12:17.036
I couldn't believe it.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.239
My man's lying dead
on the ground.

12:20.306 --> 12:22.274
And Dilemma?

12:26.178 --> 12:28.881
It ain't snitching
if the man already confessed.

12:30.149 --> 12:32.084
He was peeling off
just as I rolled up.

12:32.151 --> 12:35.087
So you actually saw him
or just his car?

12:35.154 --> 12:36.956
Who else would it be
in his whip?

12:38.958 --> 12:40.893
What's the deal
with all of these questions?

12:40.960 --> 12:42.328
Ain't you here about his music?

12:42.394 --> 12:45.965
Yeah, but this new
confession track by Sid Slay

12:46.031 --> 12:47.867
made it seem
like he was there, too.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.103
Look, I don't know nothin'
about a Sid Slay.

12:51.170 --> 12:54.039
All I know is I got Dre's text,
left Cypher

12:54.106 --> 12:55.107
and found
him dead.

12:55.174 --> 12:56.475
And had I seen his text sooner,

12:56.542 --> 12:57.810
it'd be Dilemma in the dirt.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.512
You were at Cypher Club
that night?

12:59.578 --> 13:01.013
What I said.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.115
Anything go down that night?
Any conflict?

13:03.182 --> 13:04.950
Nah, we were celebrating.

13:05.017 --> 13:06.819
My man just came home
from a ten-year bid.

13:06.886 --> 13:07.920
It was all love.

13:07.987 --> 13:09.955
What about Daoud Blickman?

13:10.022 --> 13:11.423
Did you see him there
that night?

13:11.490 --> 13:12.992
Dilemma's son?

13:13.592 --> 13:15.528
Hell nah,
his punk ass wasn't there.

13:15.594 --> 13:17.530
Shotta Boys had the spot
on lock.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.899
If Daoud or anybody else
repping B-Set

13:19.965 --> 13:21.033
would've showed up that night,

13:21.100 --> 13:23.502
they'd've left
in a body bag.

13:24.136 --> 13:27.873
So Daoud lied about where he
was the night of the murder?

13:27.940 --> 13:29.175
You don't think...

13:29.241 --> 13:30.843
He's someone
Dilemma would want to protect.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.411
And the kid's got motive.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.879
You think he's Sid Slay.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.814
It'd explain
why the voice is disguised.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.883
But if his father
is covering for him,

13:37.950 --> 13:39.285
why would he risk
putting it out there?

13:39.351 --> 13:41.153
I mean, what does
he have to gain?

13:41.220 --> 13:43.088
I'm on my way to find out now.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.157
How's it going
analyzing that track?

13:45.224 --> 13:47.159
Mm, nothing yet.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.427
But you know how they say

13:48.494 --> 13:50.095
married people
shouldn't work together

13:50.162 --> 13:51.997
if they want to stay married?

13:52.064 --> 13:53.966
Yeah, we have, uh...

13:54.633 --> 13:57.269
...made a few
adjustments.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.437
You look nervous.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.939
You want to stop?

14:00.005 --> 14:01.840
Just don't get caught.

14:29.401 --> 14:30.903
Oh, nonsense. Cameron...

14:31.470 --> 14:32.605
...why don't you come on in

14:32.671 --> 14:34.139
I just ordered

14:34.206 --> 14:37.910
A'ight. Yeah,
that sounds cool. Thanks.

14:42.014 --> 14:43.916
So...

14:43.983 --> 14:46.051
you go to
Dee's school?

14:46.118 --> 14:48.120
Nah, to Jefferson.
In the Bronx.

14:48.187 --> 14:49.888
So then how'd you two meet?

14:49.955 --> 14:50.990
Uh, through Tiffany.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.625
Yeah, she's my cousin.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.625
Oh.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.326
That's nice.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.494
So,

14:55.561 --> 14:56.629
are you a sophomore, too?

14:56.695 --> 14:58.197
Junior, actually.

14:58.264 --> 15:00.532
So you must be starting
to think about colleges.

15:00.599 --> 15:01.967
Oh, nah.

15:02.034 --> 15:03.902
Not going
to college.

15:04.470 --> 15:05.638
(gulps)
Really?

15:05.704 --> 15:07.273
And why is that?

15:07.339 --> 15:09.642
Well, I just believe it's
not worth going into debt for.

15:09.708 --> 15:11.443
I got
other plans.

15:11.510 --> 15:12.478
Oh, I see.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.613
You're a-- you're a pragmatist.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.248
(chuckles)

15:16.315 --> 15:19.251
Well, college is a luxury
that most of us can't afford.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.387
And that's why people
in my position, we...

15:21.453 --> 15:23.355
we create other options
for ourselves.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.292
You know, Cameron,
I'm all for options, but...

15:26.358 --> 15:28.394
I think a degree
can be very helpful,

15:28.460 --> 15:31.463
especially for those of us
who aren't starting out on a...

15:31.530 --> 15:33.198
on a level playing field.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.001
Well, Cameron's
a straight A student.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.203
I mean, it doesn't take money
to be smart.

15:38.837 --> 15:40.306
Growing up in the hood,
it never stopped

15:40.372 --> 15:42.675
my parents from exposing me
to everything,

15:42.741 --> 15:44.943
from politics
to poetry.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.679
And those
high tuitions,

15:46.745 --> 15:48.113
they're there for a reason.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.982
It's to keep people
like me away.

15:50.049 --> 15:52.284
So why should I go broke
for the privilege

15:52.351 --> 15:54.953

All right, dude.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.912
Mm-hmm.

16:25.784 --> 16:28.187
(door closes)

16:28.654 --> 16:30.122
Look,

16:30.189 --> 16:32.725
all due respect,
whatever you think you need,

16:32.791 --> 16:34.460
my moms is wasting her time.

16:34.526 --> 16:35.561
Is that right?

16:35.627 --> 16:37.996
Why did you tell your mom
you were at Club Cypher

16:38.063 --> 16:39.732
the night Dre Bids was killed?

16:39.798 --> 16:41.367
Because I was.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.334
Really?

16:42.401 --> 16:45.104
So how was the Shotta Boys
homecoming party?

16:46.572 --> 16:48.073
You know
what I think?

16:48.140 --> 16:50.275
After Shottas jumped you,
you wanted some payback.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.111
But Gangsta Jr. got sloppy,

16:52.177 --> 16:54.480
and Daddy had to come
clean up after him.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.480
It ain't like that.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.548
Got some other reason
you'd lie to your mom?

16:57.416 --> 16:59.752
All right, you want to know
where I was?

16:59.818 --> 17:01.186
I was here, recording.

17:01.253 --> 17:02.421
Now, you can check
the booking records.

17:02.488 --> 17:04.022
Well, why would you lie
about that?

17:04.089 --> 17:05.457
Because my pops
would've flipped.

17:05.524 --> 17:07.159
With all the heat
between B-Set and Shotta Boys,

17:07.226 --> 17:08.794
he told me
I couldn't record anymore.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.530
Because you were making
diss tracks.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.332
Like the one you're making
right now.

17:13.399 --> 17:16.101
Said with the crews warring,
it was too dangerous.

17:16.168 --> 17:18.470
When I found out
what he did for me,

17:18.537 --> 17:21.206
I didn't want to disrespect him
on top of it.

17:21.273 --> 17:23.375
After the Shotta Boys
messed me up,

17:23.442 --> 17:26.545
when I woke up
in the hospital,

17:26.612 --> 17:28.680
my pops
was there,

17:28.747 --> 17:30.482
crying.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.585
I ain't never
seen him like that.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.790
He said it was his fault.

17:37.856 --> 17:40.392
He swore to put an end to it.

17:40.459 --> 17:42.795
Two weeks later,
Dre Bids was dead.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.265
My pops is in jail
because I got caught slippin'.

17:46.331 --> 17:47.699
He's in jail because of me.

17:47.766 --> 17:49.201
Did he tell you that?

17:49.268 --> 17:50.602
Nah, but I know.

17:50.669 --> 17:51.703
You sure?

17:51.770 --> 17:53.539
Because gunning down Dre Bids

17:53.605 --> 17:56.341
in front of his own
recording studio... Why?

17:56.408 --> 17:58.377
The whole thing,
it just sounds...

17:58.444 --> 17:59.645
clumsy.

17:59.711 --> 18:03.148
I think your father
is hiding something.

18:03.215 --> 18:05.284
From all of us.

18:05.350 --> 18:08.620
And this Sid Slay has
something to do with it.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.357
I got to get back to it.

18:12.424 --> 18:13.692
Yo, Terry!

18:13.759 --> 18:15.494
TERRY:
Sup?

18:19.431 --> 18:20.732
ROBYN:
Hey, Dante. Got something?

18:20.799 --> 18:22.301
You could say that.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.269
I was looking
at witness statements.

18:24.336 --> 18:26.472
The night Dre Bids was shot,
there was a janitor

18:26.538 --> 18:29.107
working at the recording studio
earlier that night.

18:29.174 --> 18:30.175
He witness the shooting?

18:30.242 --> 18:31.577
He left before it happened,

18:31.643 --> 18:33.579
but I just
re-interviewed him.

18:33.645 --> 18:36.715
He says Dilemma wasn't
the only one there that night.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.250
As the janitor was leaving,

18:38.317 --> 18:40.252
someone else was heading
into the studio,

18:40.319 --> 18:42.554
only ten minutes
before Dre Bids' murder.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.755
He recognize 'em?

18:43.822 --> 18:45.724
He ID'd Jacob Styles,

18:45.791 --> 18:47.192
head of Trigger Beat Records.

18:47.259 --> 18:48.460
Label mogul.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.462
Trigger Beat?
That's Dilemma's label.

18:50.529 --> 18:51.864
If Styles was there that night,

18:51.930 --> 18:53.465
how come we're just finding out?

18:53.532 --> 18:55.701
When I leaned on him,
he got nervous, confessed.

18:55.767 --> 18:58.470
Someone paid him 25 Gs
not to mention it.

18:58.537 --> 19:00.772
Now, why would someone do that?

19:01.373 --> 19:03.342
MEL:

19:01.373 --> 19:03.342
Is risking arrest

19:01.373 --> 19:03.342
and hiding

19:03.408 --> 19:05.277
in the dark like a cockroach
really better

19:05.344 --> 19:07.279
than patiently telling me
what to do?

19:07.346 --> 19:09.248
Yes.
A hundred times yes.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.416
Just don't let anybody see me.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.785
(sighs)
I feel like a 12-year-old
sneaking a cigarette.

19:13.852 --> 19:16.421
(phone rings)

19:13.852 --> 19:16.421
With a life sentence
if I'm caught.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.190
Hey, Rob.

19:18.257 --> 19:19.625
Oh. Hey.

19:19.691 --> 19:20.859
Hey.

19:20.926 --> 19:23.395
Hey, were you able to access
Jacob Styles' financial records?

19:23.462 --> 19:25.564
The answer's yes,
in spite of the subpar Wi-Fi

19:25.631 --> 19:26.398
in this gin joint.

19:26.465 --> 19:27.866
People come here to drink,
not to...

19:27.933 --> 19:28.901
(stammering)

19:28.967 --> 19:29.935
(clears throat)

19:28.967 --> 19:29.935
Sorry.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.337
That's all right.
So, um, yes,

19:32.404 --> 19:34.306
this guy Styles,
he likes to drop a lot of quiche

19:34.373 --> 19:36.441
in fancy restaurants,
uh, strip joints.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.777
So, nothing unusual
for a record label exec.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.345
What about the 25 K?

19:40.412 --> 19:42.247
Pretty sure
it came from Styles.

19:42.314 --> 19:43.448
He took out that much cash

19:43.515 --> 19:44.716
right before the janitor
got his bribe.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.451
But, listen,
I-I'm onto something else.

19:46.518 --> 19:49.354
Styles has been receiving
regular money transfers

19:49.421 --> 19:51.657
from an account
belonging to Dilemma.

19:51.723 --> 19:52.658
That's not unusual.

19:52.724 --> 19:54.893
Some artists have to pay back
record labels

19:54.960 --> 19:56.428
for advances on their projects.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.664
Yeah, but this is going
to Styles' personal account,

19:58.730 --> 19:59.331
not the label's.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.433
And it began
ten months ago,

20:01.500 --> 20:02.834
right after Dilemma
got locked up.

20:02.901 --> 20:05.737
So, payments to a guy
who was secretly there

20:05.804 --> 20:07.205
at the scene of the murder?

20:07.272 --> 20:08.674
Now, that is unusual.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.309
Right?

20:08.740 --> 20:10.309
Um, babe...

20:08.740 --> 20:10.309
(door opens, loud chatter)

20:10.375 --> 20:11.944
...it's getting crowded.
Put your cigarette away.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.413
Hi! Come on in.

20:15.013 --> 20:17.683
Hey, Mike, would you
mind keying me in?

20:17.749 --> 20:19.818
I left my card upstairs.

20:17.749 --> 20:19.818
Do I know you?

20:19.885 --> 20:21.219
Yolanda, from Marketing.

20:21.286 --> 20:22.554
Katey introduced us
at my onboarding.

20:22.621 --> 20:25.557
Well, you were kind of
busy with deliveries.

20:25.624 --> 20:28.827
Look, Mr. Styles sent
me on a coffee run.

20:28.894 --> 20:32.331
I'm already ten minutes late,
and you know how he gets.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.732
It's only my second week.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.267
I don't want to get fired.

20:35.334 --> 20:36.802
(sighs heavily)

20:38.303 --> 20:40.238
(phone ringing)

20:42.641 --> 20:43.675
Yeah?

20:43.742 --> 20:45.510
Yeah. Okay.

20:49.481 --> 20:51.383
Yeah, I know how
Mr. Styles gets.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.619
Especially when you wannabes
try to sneak in

20:53.685 --> 20:56.355
to give him your demos.
Now beat it.

20:57.055 --> 20:59.524
I'll be back.

20:57.055 --> 20:59.524
I'll be here.

20:59.591 --> 21:01.627
Hit a wall with Styles.

21:01.693 --> 21:03.862
Looks like I'm gonna
need your badge.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.397
Couldn't charm your way in?

21:05.464 --> 21:07.299
Well, not everybody is

21:07.366 --> 21:08.467
as easy a mark as you are.

21:08.533 --> 21:11.603
(motorcycle engine revving)

21:11.670 --> 21:12.704
(gunshots)

21:15.607 --> 21:17.809
Hey, what's happening?

21:18.210 --> 21:20.545
You okay?

21:18.210 --> 21:20.545
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:20.612 --> 21:21.747
But it looks like someone

21:21.813 --> 21:23.382
doesn't want me
looking into this.

21:28.754 --> 21:29.921
Got here as quick as
I could. You okay?

21:29.988 --> 21:32.724
(sighs)
Aside from my bruised ego?

21:32.791 --> 21:34.459
You get a look at the rider?

21:34.526 --> 21:37.029
Black-clad leather. Five-nine.

21:37.095 --> 21:39.364
Nothing distinct.

21:39.431 --> 21:40.565
Right-handed, but
he shot with his left

21:40.632 --> 21:42.768
because of the throttle.
Nine millimeter.

21:42.834 --> 21:45.570
Bike was a modified Ducati 848.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.439
Black stealth finish, no plates.

21:47.506 --> 21:50.542
Next time, try to get
a little more detail, will you?

21:51.576 --> 21:53.345
Question is, who's mad enough

21:53.412 --> 21:55.514
about you poking around
to take a shot at you?

21:55.580 --> 21:57.349
One way to find out.

21:57.416 --> 22:00.719
I'm sorry, I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.087
Oh, just like you
have no idea why

22:02.154 --> 22:03.955
someone just shot at me
outside your offices.

22:04.022 --> 22:05.624
What the hell is this
all about?

22:05.691 --> 22:09.394
The murder of
Andre "Dre Bids" Smith.

22:09.461 --> 22:11.530
NYPD's reopening
the investigation,

22:11.596 --> 22:12.731
and for some reason,
we don't seem

22:12.798 --> 22:14.566
to have your statement on file.

22:14.633 --> 22:16.935
Why would you if I wasn't there?

22:17.002 --> 22:20.405
You know, you can lie to me.
It just pisses me off.

22:20.472 --> 22:21.940
You lie to him,

22:22.007 --> 22:24.743
it's obstruction.
That's a crime.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.712
We have a witness placing you
at the scene

22:26.778 --> 22:28.814
just before the murder.

22:26.778 --> 22:28.814
We also have evidence

22:28.880 --> 22:30.816
you paid the witness
to keep his mouth shut.

22:30.882 --> 22:32.951
I think I should
call my lawyer.

22:33.018 --> 22:36.588
If you killed Dre Bids,
you definitely should.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.423
Of course, then
I'll have to arrest you

22:38.490 --> 22:39.858
and perp-walk you out of here

22:39.925 --> 22:42.861
in time to be the lead
on the 6:00 news.

22:42.928 --> 22:45.697
Or if you didn't, you
can just tell the truth.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.035
Fine. I was there.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.838
But I had nothing to do
with the shooting.

22:52.904 --> 22:56.875
I went there to try to talk
some sense into Dilemma.

22:56.942 --> 22:59.678
He and Dre Bids were supposed
to record a track that night.

22:59.745 --> 23:02.981
Dre Bids and Dilemma, together?

23:03.048 --> 23:06.151
It was a peace track.
(chuckles softly)

23:06.218 --> 23:08.687
Dilemma told me
he'd had enough.

23:08.754 --> 23:10.789
The beef was messing
with his family.

23:10.856 --> 23:13.458
He and Dre Bids had come
to a truce.

23:13.525 --> 23:15.694
But he wasn't thinking right.

23:15.761 --> 23:18.563
They had just jumped his kid.

23:18.630 --> 23:19.998
I didn't want him
to do anything rash.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.167
Wait, you tried to
talk him out of it?

23:22.234 --> 23:23.602
(laughs)

23:23.668 --> 23:25.003
Like it or not,

23:25.070 --> 23:26.171
violence sells.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.973
He was making a fortune.

23:28.039 --> 23:29.040
We all were.

23:29.107 --> 23:30.675
It was career suicide.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.878
And why let some senseless
killings here and there

23:32.944 --> 23:34.746
stop you from making a buck?

23:36.081 --> 23:37.682
What happened that night?

23:37.749 --> 23:41.086
Like I said,
I was talking to Dilemma.

23:41.153 --> 23:42.821
Then shots rang out.

23:42.888 --> 23:44.489
You were with Dilemma
when it happened?

23:44.556 --> 23:45.791
Upstairs in the studio.

23:45.857 --> 23:47.459
He ran down to see
what was happening...

23:47.526 --> 23:50.162
And you? You got the hell
out of there, didn't you?

23:50.228 --> 23:52.497
Couldn't afford to have
your image sullied,

23:52.564 --> 23:53.632
so you paid to keep
your name out of it.

23:53.698 --> 23:56.701
You knew Dilemma
was innocent,

23:56.768 --> 23:58.637
and you still let him
go down for it?

23:58.703 --> 24:00.105
He insisted.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.907
Why would he take the fall
for something he didn't do?

24:01.973 --> 24:04.509
I asked. He said
it was none of my concern.

24:04.576 --> 24:07.212
And he's been paying you to keep
your mouth shut ever since.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.648
(chuckles softly)
That's business.

24:09.714 --> 24:12.517
Do you know how much
him going away cost me?

24:12.584 --> 24:13.919
Tell me about this peace track.

24:13.985 --> 24:16.721
I think Dre Bids might've
laid down a few verses

24:16.788 --> 24:17.756
the night before.

24:17.823 --> 24:19.591
I'm gonna need that master.

24:29.601 --> 24:31.536
(door opens)

24:31.603 --> 24:32.804
(door closes)

24:32.871 --> 24:35.040
If Dilemma didn't fire
those shots, who did?

24:35.106 --> 24:37.242
Cops ran ballistics
on the gun, right?

24:37.309 --> 24:38.643
Did they run DNA?

24:38.710 --> 24:40.245
They didn't need to.
He confessed.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.547
And it's too late
to do it now.

24:42.614 --> 24:43.949
During the rains
last year,

24:44.015 --> 24:46.885
the facility where the case
evidence was stored flooded.

24:46.952 --> 24:49.221
Some material was lost,
some destroyed.

24:49.287 --> 24:51.156
This just keeps getting better
and better.

24:51.223 --> 24:54.025
(phone buzzing)

24:55.193 --> 24:56.661
(beeps)

24:55.193 --> 24:56.661
Hey.

24:56.728 --> 24:57.762
Tell me
you're making some progress

24:57.829 --> 24:58.897
on that SoundCloud track.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.665
Well, technically, I didn't,

25:00.732 --> 25:01.967
'cause it would've required,
you know,

25:02.033 --> 25:03.535
borrowing
some NSA software,

25:03.602 --> 25:05.103
which didn't really seem
like the best idea right now.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.606
So I outsourced it
to a hacker pal of mine.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.107
She pulled apart the audio
and found this

25:09.174 --> 25:10.909
under one of the tracks.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.909
MAN:
This is an announcement

25:10.976 --> 25:13.078
to students to show
your Bulldog pride

25:13.144 --> 25:14.246
for spirit week.

25:14.312 --> 25:15.981
Spirit week? Like high school.

25:16.047 --> 25:18.116
Yep, and there are
only two high schools

25:18.183 --> 25:19.851
in the New York area
with bulldogs as their mascots.

25:19.918 --> 25:21.920
And only one has
a music lab.

25:21.987 --> 25:24.789
Uh, Washington-Hamilton High
in Queens.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.992
That's kind of a rough school.

25:27.058 --> 25:30.028
I could see B-Set and
Shotta Boys crew going there.

25:30.095 --> 25:32.697
Well, I checked the sign-in
records, and a student named...

25:32.764 --> 25:34.599
(indistinct chatter)

25:32.764 --> 25:34.599
Excuse me.

25:34.666 --> 25:36.134
(door closes)

25:36.201 --> 25:39.204
(sighs) A student named
Sidney Rodgers

25:39.271 --> 25:40.605
had been there repeatedly.

25:40.672 --> 25:42.841
As in Sid Slay?

25:42.908 --> 25:44.743
Do you have an address?

25:44.809 --> 25:45.944

25:48.680 --> 25:50.315

26:08.199 --> 26:10.635

26:12.771 --> 26:14.039
they're not mine.

26:14.873 --> 26:16.241
Whose are they?

26:16.308 --> 26:18.710
I don't know.

26:19.678 --> 26:20.812
About a month ago,

26:20.879 --> 26:22.781
I was in Washington Square Park.

26:22.847 --> 26:24.082
Crews meet there to battle,

26:24.149 --> 26:25.650
and newbies try to make a name.

26:25.717 --> 26:27.052
That's why you were there?

26:27.118 --> 26:28.186
I tried to spit,

26:28.253 --> 26:29.888
but they weren't
trying to hear me.

26:29.955 --> 26:32.190
Later, the cops
rolled through.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.325
When everybody bounced,

26:33.391 --> 26:34.859
someone left a notebook.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.195
The rhymes were
dope as hell.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.664
So I laid it down
over a track I made

26:39.731 --> 26:41.066
and dropped it on SoundCloud.

26:41.132 --> 26:43.201
And you disguised your voice?

26:43.268 --> 26:45.070
Ain't no one gonna
take me serious as a girl.

26:46.137 --> 26:47.739
Female rappers these days,

26:47.806 --> 26:49.274
they lean into
their sexuality.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.676
It's all anacondas

26:51.743 --> 26:52.911
and peaches.

26:52.978 --> 26:55.280
It's empowering,
but not my thing.

26:55.347 --> 26:56.381
I'm more...

26:56.448 --> 26:57.816
Lauryn Hill.

26:57.882 --> 26:59.784
MC Lyte.

26:57.882 --> 26:59.784
Exactly.

26:59.851 --> 27:01.219
But I need to stand out.

27:01.286 --> 27:04.689
I figured maybe I can get
some traction by being hard,

27:04.756 --> 27:05.991
like the guys.

27:06.057 --> 27:07.792
Sid, the best rappers

27:07.859 --> 27:10.895
are the ones who aren't trying
to be anyone but themselves.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.697
But I tried that.

27:12.764 --> 27:13.965
No one was interested.

27:14.032 --> 27:15.367
So, keep practicing.

27:15.433 --> 27:16.801
You got skills.

27:16.868 --> 27:18.737
But you got to be authentic.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.805
Only you know
what that means for you.

27:23.174 --> 27:25.110
You still got that notebook?

27:28.279 --> 27:29.981
(door opens)

27:32.784 --> 27:34.319
There wasn't a name in it.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.122
I checked.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.226
No need for a name.

27:41.993 --> 27:44.262
I know exactly
whose book this is.

27:51.136 --> 27:52.670
It's your notebook,
Nasir.

27:52.737 --> 27:56.441
I recognized the drawing
from your other sketchbook.

28:00.912 --> 28:02.847
You wrote those rhymes?

28:04.315 --> 28:06.718
Nas, baby, why?

28:07.485 --> 28:09.821
Because he was there
that night.

28:09.888 --> 28:12.090
It was you your dad was
covering up for.

28:12.157 --> 28:14.893
No. He was home.

28:14.959 --> 28:17.262
No, Ma. I wasn't.

28:19.164 --> 28:21.099
Baby, what are you saying?

28:21.166 --> 28:22.467
You were here.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.370
I was. But...

28:25.437 --> 28:26.905
when you left
to get your braids,

28:26.971 --> 28:28.173
I heard Dad's phone go off.

28:28.807 --> 28:31.443
He must've left it in a
rush to get to the studio.

28:32.310 --> 28:33.745
It was a text

28:33.812 --> 28:36.347
saying that the studio session
was a setup.

28:36.414 --> 28:38.883
Dre Bids was strapped
and coming for him.

28:38.950 --> 28:40.318
Who sent the text?

28:41.186 --> 28:42.821
I don't know.

28:42.887 --> 28:46.391
But I couldn't reach Dad,
and Daoud wasn't picking up.

28:46.458 --> 28:47.826
So...

28:47.892 --> 28:49.928
I grabbed Dad's gun.

28:50.728 --> 28:53.932
I only brought it to the studio
so he could protect himself.

28:53.998 --> 28:55.467
When I got there,

28:55.533 --> 28:59.003
I saw Dre Bids pulling a piece
from his trunk.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.272
(shudders)
He saw me, and...

29:01.339 --> 29:05.477
and I didn't mean to, but I got
scared and he... (sniffles)

29:07.078 --> 29:08.146
So I shot him.

29:08.213 --> 29:10.148
(sniffles)

29:10.215 --> 29:11.483
Twice.

29:10.215 --> 29:11.483
(Deidre sobs)

29:11.549 --> 29:13.785
Next thing I know,
Dad grabbed the gun,

29:13.852 --> 29:16.121
wiped it down and pushed me
into his car. (sniffles)

29:16.187 --> 29:19.457
Said it was his fault for
beefing, but... (sniffles)

29:19.524 --> 29:22.293
...it wasn't Dad's fault.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.962
I'm the one who killed him.

29:24.028 --> 29:25.163
(crying):
No. Oh, baby.

29:25.230 --> 29:27.432
(crying)

29:29.501 --> 29:31.069
Nasir...

29:31.136 --> 29:33.037
you said
you shot him twice.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.105
Are you sure?

29:34.772 --> 29:37.142
I've replayed the details
in my head for a year.

29:37.208 --> 29:38.176
Why?

29:38.243 --> 29:40.044
Because the coroner's report

29:40.111 --> 29:41.880
said that there were
three shots.

29:42.847 --> 29:45.083
Two shots were from a distance.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.818
They weren't fatal.

29:46.885 --> 29:50.054
A third shot
was from close range.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.189
To the heart.

29:51.256 --> 29:53.024
What are you saying?

29:53.658 --> 29:57.295
I don't think Nasir fired
the shot that killed Dre Bids.

29:58.163 --> 29:59.097
You still have

29:59.164 --> 30:00.999
your husband's cell?

30:01.966 --> 30:04.869
(indistinct chatter)

30:05.870 --> 30:06.871
A year-old text?

30:06.938 --> 30:09.107
No one in Dilemma's circle
recognized the number

30:09.174 --> 30:10.341
that sent that warning.

30:10.408 --> 30:11.543
Can you trace it?

30:11.609 --> 30:13.478
With my current lack
of resources,

30:13.545 --> 30:16.047
I don't know.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.047
Didn't Brawlah say

30:16.114 --> 30:18.216
Dre Bids was worried
something might be going down

30:18.283 --> 30:19.517
at the studio that night?

30:19.584 --> 30:21.553
You think Dre Bids got
a warning text, too?

30:21.619 --> 30:25.223
Well, someone was trying
to stir up trouble.

30:25.290 --> 30:30.028
Probably that same someone who
sent that hitter at me today.

30:30.094 --> 30:31.362

But the same phone was used

32:56.574 --> 32:58.009
to text and call
a slew of others.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.277
All young women--
a couple connected

who was, uh,

33:04.816 --> 33:06.517
a little different
from the others.

33:06.584 --> 33:08.286
A Mrs. Gladys Marshall.

Uh-huh. The genius used a burner
to call his mom.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.062
I mean, there's definitely
something Freudian

33:18.129 --> 33:18.796
about all this.

33:18.863 --> 33:21.699
So if Brawlah sent those texts,

33:21.766 --> 33:23.134
then he must've known

33:23.201 --> 33:26.270
that Dilemma and Dre Bids
were gonna meet.

33:26.337 --> 33:28.606
He knew about the truce.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.409
And he was trying to end it.

33:51.129 --> 33:53.030
I'm not here
for no damn podcast.

33:53.097 --> 33:54.298
But I guess
you know that,

33:54.365 --> 33:56.100
since you sent
your little motorcycle guy

33:56.167 --> 33:57.101
to gun me down.

33:57.168 --> 33:58.569
(laughs)

33:58.636 --> 34:00.638
Lady, you trippin'.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.074
You can drop the act.

34:03.141 --> 34:05.376
I know you sent texts
to Dilemma and Dre Bids

34:05.443 --> 34:06.544
the night of the murder,

34:06.611 --> 34:08.212
setting them
against each other.

34:08.279 --> 34:09.514
And why would I do that?

34:09.580 --> 34:11.682
Peace is a problem
if your brand is beef.

34:11.749 --> 34:14.352
It would've been the
end of your career.

34:14.419 --> 34:15.653
You wanted gunfire that night.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.288
You needed to keep it going.

34:17.355 --> 34:20.525
But when you saw Dre Bids
on the ground, wounded,

34:20.591 --> 34:21.759
you got scared.

34:21.826 --> 34:23.661
I mean, if he survived,

34:23.728 --> 34:25.596
he might ask questions.

34:25.663 --> 34:27.265
But if he died...

34:28.099 --> 34:30.668
...then look who inherits
his kingdom.

34:31.302 --> 34:34.372
Everybody knows
that Dilemma killed Dre Bids.

34:34.439 --> 34:35.473
He confessed.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.375
True.

34:37.442 --> 34:40.077
But, thanks to me,

34:40.144 --> 34:42.814
the gun just got retested
for DNA.

34:43.481 --> 34:45.750
And it came back
with three matches.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.618
One was Dilemma's.

34:47.685 --> 34:49.220
One was his
son's. And...

34:51.155 --> 34:55.626
...I'm sure if they were
to run saliva on this blunt...

34:56.260 --> 34:58.863
...the third
would match yours.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.535
(sighs)

35:04.602 --> 35:05.803
I guess I was right.

35:05.870 --> 35:07.672
Doesn't matter if you dead.

35:08.573 --> 35:10.374
One of 'em had to go.

35:10.441 --> 35:13.144
Even if you had to shoot
Dre Bids yourself.

35:13.211 --> 35:14.345
Damn straight.

35:14.412 --> 35:17.415
I'm supposed to fall off
'cause they went soft?

35:17.482 --> 35:18.749
Give up what's mine?

35:18.816 --> 35:20.384
I worked too hard for this, yo.

35:20.451 --> 35:22.520
Ain't nobody taking it away.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.188
Not Dre Bids.

35:24.255 --> 35:25.389
Not Dilemma.

35:25.456 --> 35:26.724
And not you.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.594
DAOUD:
That's where
you wrong.

35:31.395 --> 35:33.197
Because I'm here
to end you.

35:40.505 --> 35:42.673
Daoud, don't. I got this.

35:42.740 --> 35:43.541
The hell you do.

35:43.608 --> 35:44.609
Put the gun down.

35:44.675 --> 35:46.310
Nah, Nasir told me everything.

35:46.377 --> 35:48.713
How he shot Dre Bids twice
but there was a third bullet.

35:48.779 --> 35:50.882
You were first
on the scene.

35:50.948 --> 35:51.749
The witness.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.684
I was gonna ask this fool
what he saw,

35:53.751 --> 35:55.553
but guess I don't need to
anymore.

35:55.620 --> 35:56.921
Daoud, please.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.423
Yo, you been sweatin'
me and my pops for years.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.826
Now you got my little brother
wrapped up in this mess?

36:02.760 --> 36:04.161
Nah, this ends right now.

36:04.228 --> 36:06.697
(laughs)
You ain't about that life.

36:06.764 --> 36:08.199
ROBYN:
Daoud, listen.

36:08.266 --> 36:09.800
Do you think this is
what your dad would want?

36:09.867 --> 36:11.302
I ain't trying to hear all that!

36:11.369 --> 36:13.304
He was willing
to spend 25 years in prison

36:13.371 --> 36:15.206
to keep your brother
from this life.

36:15.273 --> 36:17.875
Doesn't that mean
something to you?

36:17.942 --> 36:19.777
You think he would
go through all that

36:19.844 --> 36:21.812
just for you
to switch places with him?

36:21.879 --> 36:23.681
Someone's got to pay a price.

36:23.748 --> 36:26.651
(sighs)
Yeah, but not you.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.354
(grunting)

36:28.519 --> 36:30.354
(gunshot)

36:33.291 --> 36:34.458
(exhales)

36:34.525 --> 36:36.494
He's ruined
enough lives.

36:36.561 --> 36:38.329
You want him to ruin yours, too?

36:47.305 --> 36:48.573
(chuckles)

36:48.639 --> 36:49.840
You ain't got nothing.

36:49.907 --> 36:51.509
When my lawyer's done,

36:51.576 --> 36:53.578
that DNA won't mean jack.

36:53.644 --> 36:55.379
Yeah, but your
confession will.

36:55.446 --> 36:57.214
Your mic's still open.

36:57.281 --> 36:59.617
I got a feeling that's the last
track you're gonna be recording

36:59.684 --> 37:01.419
for a while.

37:07.525 --> 37:08.926
VI:
So...

37:10.494 --> 37:11.629
...what are we watching?

37:11.696 --> 37:14.632
Action? Comedy?
Psychological thriller?

37:14.699 --> 37:16.000
It doesn't matter.

37:18.436 --> 37:19.937
You sure you don't want
to talk about it?

37:20.004 --> 37:22.807
No. It's nothing, Aunt Vi.
Really.

37:22.873 --> 37:24.475
(phone buzzing)

37:27.678 --> 37:29.347
Go on.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.015
Take it.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.452
(beeps)

37:40.458 --> 37:42.994
All the drama in this house,
who needs a movie?

37:43.060 --> 37:44.662
CAMERON:
Hey. What's good?

37:44.729 --> 37:46.631
Not much.

37:44.729 --> 37:46.631
Uh...

37:46.697 --> 37:48.799
Look, about earlier...

37:46.697 --> 37:48.799
I just wanted to see if...

37:48.866 --> 37:50.568
Sorry, you go.

37:48.866 --> 37:50.568
(chuckles)

37:50.635 --> 37:51.936
I just wanted to see

37:52.003 --> 37:53.537

the new Jordan Peele movie

37:53.604 --> 37:54.905
next weekend.

37:56.374 --> 37:57.842
Uh... yeah.

37:57.908 --> 37:59.877
Yeah, sure.
That-That'd be great.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.480
Well, I mean, we don't have to.

38:02.546 --> 38:05.316
No, no. I-I just...

38:05.383 --> 38:07.551
You know, honestly,
I thought we were done.

38:07.618 --> 38:08.853
(sighs)
Yeah, look,

38:08.919 --> 38:10.721
I'm sorry for tripping
like that yesterday.

38:10.788 --> 38:13.357
Uh, I was just...

38:13.424 --> 38:15.860
Look, I respect
that college matters to you.

38:16.427 --> 38:19.830
I'm just hoping you can respect
that it's not for me.

38:19.897 --> 38:22.566
I'm not mad at you, though,
for pushing back.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.568
Well, good,

38:24.635 --> 38:27.038
'cause I do that.

38:27.104 --> 38:28.706
It's kind of who I am.

38:28.773 --> 38:30.007
(chuckles)

38:30.074 --> 38:32.043
That's what I like about you,
Dee.

38:32.109 --> 38:34.445
Most girls,
they wouldn't even care.

38:34.512 --> 38:36.814
Okay, and it helps
that you fine, too.

38:36.881 --> 38:38.816
(chuckles)
Stop.

38:38.883 --> 38:39.984
Okay, I got to go.

38:40.051 --> 38:41.052
All right,
I'm-a talk to you later.

38:41.118 --> 38:42.586
Okay. Bye.

38:44.121 --> 38:45.890
Yes!

38:45.956 --> 38:49.360
Beefing on records,
I provided for my family.

38:49.427 --> 38:53.064
I never imagined
the damage it could cause.

38:53.130 --> 38:55.966
My son has a price to pay,
and that's on me.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.369
But us getting to this truth,

38:58.436 --> 39:02.540
us being free
from all of this...

39:03.941 --> 39:06.377
...we owe that to you.

39:08.446 --> 39:09.980
Well,

39:10.047 --> 39:13.484
your family can
come back from this.

39:13.551 --> 39:14.552
Stronger,

39:14.618 --> 39:16.587
with a
fresh start.

39:17.221 --> 39:19.590
You got some work to do
in the community, though.

39:20.891 --> 39:22.493
To repair what you helped break.

39:22.560 --> 39:25.830
But the good thing is Daoud
is already doing his part.

39:25.896 --> 39:26.897
What do you mean?

39:26.964 --> 39:29.500
