00:12.512 --> 00:15.140
[Ben] <i>I have that feeling</i>
<i>like when you just quit a job.</i>

00:16.641 --> 00:18.351
<i>Tell your boss to get fucked,</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:21.980
<i>walk out to your car and just drive away.</i>
[laughs]

00:22.105 --> 00:25.817
<i>It's a good feeling, man.</i> [laughs]

00:26.901 --> 00:29.362
[sighs]
<i>I've never been a fan of the routine.</i>

00:29.446 --> 00:32.615
<i>I've never been a person</i>
<i>other people can force into a thing.</i>

00:32.699 --> 00:34.826
<i>I mean, I'm peaceful, I'm loving,</i>

00:34.909 --> 00:36.578
<i>but I'm not like the others. I'm not.</i>

00:36.661 --> 00:39.622
I'm not like the others, and I will not
fall in line with the others.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.792
When they're saying, "This is normal,
what you walked into is normal,

00:42.876 --> 00:44.169
what we built here is normal,

00:44.252 --> 00:46.629
and your reaction to it is wrong.
That's not normal."

00:46.713 --> 00:48.214
No, no.

00:50.675 --> 00:51.676
Mnh-mnh.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.016
You serve in the military?

00:58.975 --> 01:01.936
I get it, I get it. Thank you.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.563
I can never do that.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.106
Thank you for your service.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.028
[sniffles] <i>Did you ever wake up</i>
<i>in the middle of the night</i>

01:10.111 --> 01:12.405
<i>and play out the worst possible scenario?</i>

01:12.822 --> 01:14.407
<i>Like you're driving your car,</i>

01:14.783 --> 01:18.286
<i>and a kid comes out of nowhere</i>
<i>on a bike or one of them scooters,</i>

01:18.369 --> 01:20.205
<i>and you smack into that kid,</i>

01:20.622 --> 01:22.123
<i>the kid dies.</i>

01:23.083 --> 01:25.668
The good part of your life is over.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.923
I wake up, I'll just flash to that.

01:32.008 --> 01:32.967
Me, not you.

01:34.552 --> 01:35.929
In my warm bed,

01:37.847 --> 01:39.808
roof over my head. [laughs]

01:42.227 --> 01:44.437
In my warm bed, roof over my head.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.525
Food in the fridge--
Fridge in first place.

01:48.608 --> 01:52.403
I'll wake up, I'll just start thinking
about the guy by the gun store

01:52.487 --> 01:53.696
who lives in a tarp.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.034
And the city just keeps fucking with him,
and he's just a guy.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.869
He's just a guy. He's just a guy.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.080
He's just a guy out of his mind.

02:02.163 --> 02:05.041
He's probably a marine, because he has
that look, much like yourself.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.919
He has that look much like yourself,
and he's just trying to get it all--

02:08.002 --> 02:09.629
He's just trying to get by, but he can't,

02:09.712 --> 02:12.382
'cause he can't-- 'cause he can't--
'cause he can't get...

02:14.217 --> 02:15.385
But he can't...

02:18.847 --> 02:21.474
find the click anymore, the...

02:23.184 --> 02:24.018
the...

02:24.435 --> 02:25.395
the key.

02:26.437 --> 02:27.397
Can't get it all...

02:32.527 --> 02:33.820
put together again.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.990
But there are days, I would imagine...
[sniffles]

02:37.615 --> 02:38.950
...there are days when...

02:40.243 --> 02:42.662
when it's like-- when it's close.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.165
When it's, like, this close to, like...

02:47.834 --> 02:48.710
"Oh...

02:50.628 --> 02:51.880
I remember.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.385
I remember what my mind was

02:58.219 --> 03:00.805
before the thing happened
that ruined my mind.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.644
I remember who I am now.

03:08.229 --> 03:12.692
And I don't gotta sleep on the sidewalk
by the gun store

03:13.276 --> 03:15.236
in order not to kill myself

03:16.613 --> 03:17.906
or kill my wife."

03:20.074 --> 03:22.243
But then... [whooshes]

03:27.707 --> 03:28.958
He loses it.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.586
<i>Another day goes by,</i>

03:32.337 --> 03:33.922
<i>I'll lie in my bed...</i>

03:35.006 --> 03:35.840
<i>cry about...</i>

03:37.425 --> 03:39.761
killing the kid on the scooter or...

03:40.678 --> 03:42.222
the homeless marine...

03:43.765 --> 03:45.308
or my father dying.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.812
<i>And my father was not</i>
<i>a good person, but...</i>

03:50.563 --> 03:52.357
<i>I imagine him there at the end.</i>

04:02.867 --> 04:05.286
[sniffles] I just want to hold him.

04:09.749 --> 04:10.833
You know?

04:12.460 --> 04:14.671
[sniffles] That's kind of always been
a problem of mine.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.798
I'll go deep into another person's shit.

04:17.715 --> 04:20.260
Or I spin out on a thing
that hasn't happened yet.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.594
It might not happen.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.348
But I worry. I just worry.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.892
Like Tom Petty.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.773
What a shame.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.652
[inhales deeply, sighs]

04:37.735 --> 04:39.445
My day's been going good, man.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.072
How's your day been going?

04:43.825 --> 04:45.827
[theme music playing]

05:04.929 --> 05:06.055
Motherfucker.

05:08.933 --> 05:09.976
[Marty] Is he here?

05:10.435 --> 05:12.770
-The fuck's it look like?
-How did you get him out?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.940
You and Wendy aren't the only
fucking people I know.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.527
Did you consider that we put him
in the hospital because he is sick,

05:19.610 --> 05:20.737
'cause he needs to get better?

05:21.362 --> 05:22.947
Did you ever consider you're full of shit

05:23.031 --> 05:25.033
and you put him there
because you got embarrassed

05:25.116 --> 05:28.619
at your dumb-ass
Missouri State dick-lickin' party?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.079
You do not know him like we do.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.206
I've known him
since he was 19 years old, all right?

05:32.332 --> 05:35.418
Then why'd you put him in the hospital
when he was begging you not to?

05:35.501 --> 05:37.628
-Be--
-You've known me since I was 19 years old.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.089
Is that the kind of treatment
I got looking forward to?

05:40.173 --> 05:42.592
Hey, when he's like this,
he hurts himself. Okay?

05:42.675 --> 05:44.302
You're fucking lying to yourself.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.138
There's other ways
of dealing with shit like that.

05:47.263 --> 05:51.100
He is sick.
You need to understand our position, okay?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.311
He knows everything that we do.

05:53.644 --> 05:54.812
Do you hear me?

05:55.980 --> 05:56.814
Hey.

05:59.817 --> 06:01.194
What the fuck, man?

06:01.277 --> 06:02.320
[Marty] How you feeling?

06:02.403 --> 06:03.654
How am I feeling?

06:03.821 --> 06:05.698
Like you had me fucking committed.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.576
That's how I'm fucking feeling.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.204
[both] Hi.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.206
-Hi. Why don't you get--
-Are you okay?

06:13.289 --> 06:15.583
Yeah, why don't you go inside?
It's air-conditioned. Okay?

06:15.666 --> 06:16.918
I will in a second.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.586
I'm glad he's here, actually.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.296
[Ruth stammers]

06:21.506 --> 06:24.634
[sniffles]
You and Wendy can go fuck yourselves.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.969
You pass that along. We're done.

06:27.261 --> 06:30.681
And I just told your bitch lawyer
she can go fuck herself, too.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.350
That bullshit's over right now.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.644
-You talked to Helen?
-What did you say? What did you say?

06:34.727 --> 06:36.979
-You spoke to Helen?
-Yes, I spoke to her.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.608
You don't get to commit me.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.485
There's a lot of things
that you can do to me,

06:42.568 --> 06:45.279
but you do not get to lock me up
in a hospital

06:45.363 --> 06:48.574
and tranquilize me like
I'm some kind of fucking zoo animal.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.161
[sobbing]
Do you realize what you're doing here?

06:52.245 --> 06:54.163
Do you know how far from normal

06:54.247 --> 06:57.041
every single thing you're doing
actually is?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.836
I just had to tell a 16-year-old kid

06:59.919 --> 07:03.047
that her mother is a lawyer
for a fucking drug cartel.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.633
-Wait, what?
-That bears no relationship to normal.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.677
Calm down. Did you talk to her kid?

07:08.344 --> 07:11.180
-Did you talk to her kid?
-Yes, I talked to her fucking kid.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.100
-You gotta find a place to take him.
-I spoke to her fucking kid,

07:14.183 --> 07:15.768
who, by the way, I feel sorry for,

07:15.852 --> 07:18.354
because she has no clue
what she's in the fucking middle of.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.731
You don't have a clue
what you're in the middle of, all right?

07:20.815 --> 07:21.732
Get in the truck, now!

07:21.816 --> 07:23.151
-What the fuck?
-Go with Ruth.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.111
She's gonna fucking kill you.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.654
-Come on, you gotta go.
-What?

07:26.737 --> 07:27.655
Get out of here.

07:27.738 --> 07:30.158
[Ruth] Get in the fucking car, now!

07:31.409 --> 07:32.577
What the fuck?

07:33.077 --> 07:34.162
[car door opens]

07:36.247 --> 07:37.165
[car door shuts]

07:37.665 --> 07:38.749
Okay, so tell me this.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.294
Is it hospital policy
to allow psychiatric patients

07:41.377 --> 07:43.796
to get into cabs alone
when they're released?

07:44.088 --> 07:45.047
No, that's right.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.633
No family member,
no guardianship whatsoever.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.052
Oh--

07:50.636 --> 07:51.512
Look--

07:52.346 --> 07:54.515
Don't speak to me that way. No, no, no.

07:54.599 --> 07:58.186
Do not speak to me about patient rights
when I know all about this. I--

08:00.396 --> 08:02.064
-[groans] I'm done with you.
-[beeps]

08:03.399 --> 08:06.110
[door slides open, shuts]

08:08.613 --> 08:10.615
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you pull in.

08:10.698 --> 08:11.991
Well, I'm sorry.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.618
I'm assuming you heard about Ben.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.828
-I have. Have you spoken to him?
-No.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.371
No, I don't know anything.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.998
But do you?

08:19.290 --> 08:21.334
I mean,
why would the judge rescind the order?

08:21.417 --> 08:22.251
I don't know.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.172
The hospital called me
and told me they released him.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.132
-That's all I know.
-I was just on the phone with them.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.717
-They're useless.
-[cell phone vibrates]

08:29.800 --> 08:31.344
Oh, it's Marty.

08:31.802 --> 08:32.637
Hey.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.640
[Marty] <i>Hey. Um, he fucked up with Helen.</i>

08:38.017 --> 08:39.810
She's-- She's right here, actually.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.187
Is that right?

08:41.270 --> 08:45.316
Uh, well, listen, you're gonna
have to do your best not to react.

08:45.399 --> 08:46.359
No.

08:46.984 --> 08:48.027
No, she...

08:48.653 --> 08:50.696
She doesn't know any more than we do.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.658
[sighs] <i>Ruth got Darlene to get him out,</i>

08:53.741 --> 08:55.660
and then he went to Helen's,

08:55.743 --> 09:00.414
and apparently they got in a fight,
and he told Erin everything.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.583
<i>I'm on my way to you, honey, all right?</i>

09:05.127 --> 09:06.003
Okay.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.674
[stammers] <i>How is she behaving?</i>
<i>Uh, is she acting like nothing happened?</i>

09:09.757 --> 09:10.758
Yes. [sniffles]

09:11.509 --> 09:15.096
And I tried to call them,
and they don't know anything, either.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.099
<i>Just, can you tell Helen that, uh,</i>
<i>I was there at Ruth's,</i>

09:18.224 --> 09:19.809
<i>and there's no one there?</i>

09:19.892 --> 09:20.893
All right.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.062
<i>I asked Ruth to get him out of there,</i>

09:23.145 --> 09:25.022
<i>and she probably took him to Darlene's.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

09:25.106 --> 09:26.148
Okay.

09:27.733 --> 09:28.985
Well, we will, uh...

09:30.736 --> 09:33.072
-We'll see you when you get here.
-<i>Yeah, see you in a bit.</i>

09:40.997 --> 09:41.831
[Wendy] Uh...

09:43.332 --> 09:45.918
-Marty's at Ruth's. There's no one there.
-Hmm.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.298
He's on his way here.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.591
Oh.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.013
My brother's really sick.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.473
I know.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.601
That must be so hard.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.914
[Charlotte] Hey. What's going on?

10:23.998 --> 10:26.250
[Erin] What exactly do your parents
do for a living?

10:27.418 --> 10:29.086
-[Charlotte] What?
-What do they do with my mom?

10:30.421 --> 10:31.839
I mean, she's their lawyer.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.800
Yeah, and they're business partners.
What's going on?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.930
Did your uncle just get released
from a mental hospital?

10:43.768 --> 10:45.227
What are you talking about right now?

10:47.772 --> 10:49.190
Your uncle just came to my house

10:49.273 --> 10:52.276
and told me my mom works
for a Mexican drug cartel.

10:53.235 --> 10:54.612
What do you have to say about that?

10:59.533 --> 11:00.576
So, it is true.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.246
God, and what about your parents?

11:07.833 --> 11:10.169
They own and operate shell companies--

11:10.252 --> 11:11.462
Jonah, don't.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.303
Unless you want
your whole fucking life blown apart,

11:19.387 --> 11:21.222
you have to listen to me, okay?

11:22.640 --> 11:24.100
You can't tell anyone.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.102
Trust me.

11:26.811 --> 11:27.978
You don't want that.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.440
You can't talk to anyone about any of it.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.276
And when you need to talk about stuff,

11:34.819 --> 11:36.737
-you can talk to us.
-But only us.

11:37.446 --> 11:38.864
It's how it has to be.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.459
Thank you for doing this.

12:31.667 --> 12:35.963
We're just gonna need him to be hid
long enough for shit to calm down.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.174
He'll be fine here.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.677
I'm gonna have to go back to the casino
so nothing seems unusual.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.846
You know,
we'll get the cash and passports,

12:43.929 --> 12:45.598
and everything will be lined up.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.266
I'm not leaving the country.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.185
You're gonna leave the fucking country

12:49.268 --> 12:52.730
if I ask you
to leave the fucking country, okay?

12:56.609 --> 12:57.860
I'm sorry.

13:01.030 --> 13:01.989
It's fine.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.991
[Darlene] Everybody stay calm.

13:05.117 --> 13:10.122
He's got safe haven here with us
for as long as need be.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.459
You come on with me, Benjamin.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.336
I'll get you a cool drink.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.475
Thank you for this.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.775
Seems like a nice guy.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.319
[both chuckle]

13:40.778 --> 13:41.779
Yeah.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.658
There are people trying to kill him.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.912
You know, everything he touches
turns to dog shit.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.084
I'm starting to think
we might be related.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.585
[both laugh]

13:58.337 --> 14:00.172
Well, I take your point, but...

14:02.508 --> 14:04.385
I speak to my dead father,

14:04.468 --> 14:06.971
and I'm in love with a woman
that speaks to her dead husband

14:07.054 --> 14:09.431
and is old enough
to be my grandmother, so...

14:11.225 --> 14:12.476
What's crazy, really?

14:13.727 --> 14:14.770
In love?

14:16.689 --> 14:17.648
Yeah.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.651
It's okay you're in love with the guy.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.407
I didn't say I was in love with him.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.289
Mm-hmm.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.502
[laughing]

14:44.383 --> 14:46.260
Are you sure that this is okay?

14:47.219 --> 14:49.138
-What, him being here?
-Yeah.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.181
Yeah, it's fine. She likes you.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.684
Why?

14:55.019 --> 14:56.270
'Cause I like you.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.694
-[laughs]
-It's gonna be all right.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.418
We can call if he shows up.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.420
[Helen] I don't mind waiting.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.348
[Wendy] Are you-- Are you hungry at all?

15:32.431 --> 15:34.433
All right. Let's just stop.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.602
Where the fuck is he?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.148
I'm so sorry.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.693
[stammers] The good news is...

15:46.028 --> 15:47.363
he is insane.

15:47.988 --> 15:50.574
And I can tell Erin how very sick he is.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.910
-How everything--
-I have done that, obviously.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.286
She didn't believe me.

15:54.370 --> 15:57.623
Well, I will make her believe me.
I have a thousand stories, trust me,

15:57.748 --> 15:59.667
and then, Helen, I will find him,

15:59.750 --> 16:02.211
and I will get him out of the country.
I'll make him disappear.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.672
You'll never have to think of him again.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.341
-Helen, please--
-[sliding door opens]

16:09.468 --> 16:10.344
[Erin] We need to talk.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.930
I thought about what you said.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.181
You're a fucking liar.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.183
-[Wendy] Erin--
-Don't bother.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.769
Erin, you need to understand. My--

16:18.894 --> 16:21.981
My brother's been making up
fantasies like this his whole life.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.399
Let's do this at home--

16:23.482 --> 16:25.442
No, they should be a part of this.
Don't you think?

16:25.526 --> 16:28.362
Erin, honey, look at me. Look at me.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.658
Your mother is not a criminal.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.954
Or a-- a lawyer to a drug lord.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.873
We're not-- We're not criminals.

16:40.624 --> 16:41.917
Think about it. It's insane.

16:42.001 --> 16:42.835
Mom.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.762
[stammers] I--

16:54.930 --> 16:56.348
I don't even know you.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.184
And I-- I can't be near you.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.730
I'm going back to that stupid house,
getting my stuff, and I am going home.

17:06.150 --> 17:09.570
-[Erin gasps, sobs]
-[door slams shut]

17:09.695 --> 17:12.281
-[sighs]
-[Wendy] She'll calm down.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.953
She will. Um...

17:18.537 --> 17:23.584
We can talk to her, and um...
we will deal with Ben.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.587
Just, please, let us fix this.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.215
There's been a lot of fixing lately,
don't you think?

17:30.299 --> 17:31.508
With both of you?

17:33.927 --> 17:35.804
And I understand that it's too much to ask

17:35.888 --> 17:38.766
that you neutralize
this particular situation yourself,

17:38.849 --> 17:41.977
but I think we can all agree
that today's events point to some...

17:42.936 --> 17:44.980
pretty unacceptable vulnerabilities.

17:46.774 --> 17:47.733
[sighs]

17:48.817 --> 17:50.819
And I am gonna have to fix that.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.495
[door opens, closes]

18:02.915 --> 18:05.501
Can you give to your mother and me
a moment, please?

18:07.836 --> 18:08.670
No.

18:12.549 --> 18:13.759
-No?
-No.

18:25.646 --> 18:26.730
Where is Ben?

18:29.650 --> 18:30.692
He's with Ruth.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.655
[sighs] Somebody's gotta watch him.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.406
-I can do that.
-No. No, you can't.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.950
You can't help that way.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.579
[Jonah] Why don't we all go away?

18:44.748 --> 18:46.625
-[Charlotte sighs]
-We can just go someplace safe

18:46.708 --> 18:48.210
and start a new life again.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.797
It's easy enough
with the accounts I've got set up.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.757
We can find a surrogate
to deal with everything,

18:53.841 --> 18:55.968
and we can take Ben and Ruth with us.

18:56.510 --> 18:57.553
Jonah...

18:58.637 --> 18:59.805
we can't do that.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.979
We need to get money out of the mausoleum,
get documents lined up for Ben.

19:07.062 --> 19:09.022
You need to get Agent Miller her job back.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.024
-I'm working on that.
-Yeah, work faster.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.944
Have to get him out of the country.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.779
Why does he have to leave the country?

19:16.321 --> 19:17.698
Just because he told Erin?

19:19.741 --> 19:21.451
But Erin will be fine.

19:22.035 --> 19:22.995
We're fine.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.288
He fucked up.

19:24.371 --> 19:25.789
-Wendy...
-No, he did.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.292
And you both know...

19:29.543 --> 19:31.712
we can't make mistakes like this.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.512
Helen will go to Navarro over this.
She will.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.017
He needs to know
that we're more valuable than she is.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.064
-[silverware clatters]
-[scraping]

19:57.404 --> 19:58.280
[slurps]

20:09.166 --> 20:11.293
I like your lady. She's cool.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.004
Oh, cool.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.223
[sighs] Ruth's really angry.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.269
She's just scared. You know?

20:29.353 --> 20:31.480
She works for bad people.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.489
I feel like I fucked up pretty bad.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.616
I mean, she grabbed a shotgun

20:43.116 --> 20:44.660
before we left the house.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.412
No, look...

20:49.039 --> 20:52.751
I've never seen Ruth in love before,

20:52.834 --> 20:55.462
and I've known her my whole life.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.630
So...

20:57.714 --> 20:58.715
You...

20:59.841 --> 21:01.760
feel pretty sure about that?

21:04.763 --> 21:07.641
Well, doesn't really matter
how I feel about it.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.142
How do you feel about it?

21:11.645 --> 21:12.771
I love her.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.737
There's nobody like her.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.116
[chuckles softly]

21:25.409 --> 21:26.493
No, there's not.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.169
Do you think I should...

21:40.882 --> 21:42.175
Do you think I should go and...

21:42.509 --> 21:44.761
tell her I know how fucking stupid I am?

21:45.220 --> 21:46.096
No.

21:52.811 --> 21:53.812
I could...

21:54.187 --> 21:55.564
I could call Helen.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.985
Look, I don't think that
she would've brought you here

22:00.068 --> 22:02.738
and told you to stay
if she wanted you to leave.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.364
Right.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.453
[sighs] So I should stay.

22:11.038 --> 22:11.913
Yes.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.333
Okay.

22:16.835 --> 22:17.669
You sure?

22:19.463 --> 22:20.589
I am.

22:25.218 --> 22:26.470
[exhales]

23:11.473 --> 23:13.100
[Marty]<i> Sure, yeah, I understand.</i>

23:13.183 --> 23:16.144
One last final push today,

23:16.228 --> 23:17.437
$300,000.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.439
-I know, but you just told me to cool it.
-Mm-hmm.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.691
Well, but today is a brand-new day.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.320
This isn't a cash flow issue, is it?

23:25.404 --> 23:26.613
It is, actually. Yeah.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.782
Okay, well, I'm just--
I'm just worried about the FBI.

23:28.865 --> 23:29.950
-Because...
-It's fine, yeah.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.618
...there's a problem with the money.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.245
Not a problem. Not a problem at all.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.831
-I need between $250,000 and $300,000.
-[sighs]

23:35.914 --> 23:36.957
Need you to do it for me.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.500
You can, 'cause I've seen your work.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.168
-I--
-Okay? Today. Thank you.

23:41.628 --> 23:42.671
[sighs]

23:46.091 --> 23:47.092
Damn it.

23:48.135 --> 23:51.138
-[dice clatter]
-[chattering]

23:51.221 --> 23:52.639
-[man] Ooh!
-[dealer] Craps, two.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.118
[Sam sighs] Thank you.

24:14.202 --> 24:15.787
[Maya] Hello, Mr. Dermody.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.629
[knock on door]

25:05.712 --> 25:06.546
Yeah.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.465
[Sam panting]

25:08.590 --> 25:10.592
Marty, she knows.
She knows something's up.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.052
[stammers] I can't do this anymore.

25:12.302 --> 25:14.346
I just can't do it.
Maybe the hormones are kicking in.

25:14.429 --> 25:16.097
Don't know if that works with pregnancy
or what.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.098
Goddamn it.

25:17.432 --> 25:19.351
[Sam] I know.
I thought it was gonna be easy, too.

25:19.434 --> 25:20.977
I mean, you just lose a little money.

25:21.061 --> 25:24.105
Nobody's gonna know because it's gambling.
Everybody loses money.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.650
-Fuck me.
-You don't have to cuss at me like that.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.860
What the hell are you doing?

25:31.154 --> 25:32.572
You can't be here.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.033
[Sam] I'm just trying to figure out
what I can do

25:35.116 --> 25:37.410
-to make this more smooth.
-Shit.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.996
-What are you talking about?
-Just stick to the fucking plan, Sam.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.706
Wait. You're cussing me again.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.833
I'm so sorry, Ruth.

25:44.709 --> 25:45.752
I love you.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.838
I didn't mean to hurt you
or do anything stupid.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.173
Ben, you cannot be here.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.216
Everything's fine.

25:51.299 --> 25:52.717
No, everything is not fine.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.512
Nelson is downstairs.
Come on, you gotta come with me.

25:58.682 --> 25:59.724
Come on.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.560
Just go with him.

26:02.644 --> 26:05.146
Do what the fuck he tells you.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.319
I love you, too.

26:13.363 --> 26:14.322
I do.

26:41.975 --> 26:44.686
[breath trembling]

26:48.815 --> 26:52.068
Yeah, I understand. Just rent a car
and meet us at mile marker 18.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.612
Tell her I said I'm sorry.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.407
Tell her I wanted to apologize to Ruth.
Tell her I'm sorry.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.034
Yeah, okay, all right.

26:59.117 --> 27:02.162
And, uh--
And Ben says that he's sorry. Okay?

27:03.455 --> 27:04.956
Yeah. Bye.

27:06.541 --> 27:08.627
-Was she mad?
-[engine starts]

27:08.710 --> 27:09.794
What do you think?

27:20.722 --> 27:22.599
[Ben] <i>Are you sure I can't fix this?</i>

27:35.487 --> 27:36.363
All right.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.042
You taught me a lot over the years.

27:52.879 --> 27:54.047
No, I haven't.

27:55.632 --> 27:58.259
I called you that night Bush won
the second time.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.721
And I called you, freaking out...
[laughing]

28:01.805 --> 28:04.432
...'cause I hadn't done my taxes
in, like, nine years.

28:07.227 --> 28:09.479
That is the night I taught you
all about the Internet.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.690
Then you taught me TurboTax.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.149
[Marty chuckles]

28:14.484 --> 28:16.236
You wouldn't let me do your taxes.

28:18.363 --> 28:19.447
And, uh...

28:20.240 --> 28:23.827
the year I taught you TurboTax,
didn't you get audited? So, you know...

28:25.870 --> 28:26.996
Still, that's...

28:30.959 --> 28:34.254
If you give me a chance,
I can make this right.

28:37.674 --> 28:38.925
[Marty sighs]

28:40.552 --> 28:42.512
Ben, I, um...

28:43.179 --> 28:44.139
Look...

28:56.651 --> 28:59.654
I made a decision a few years ago.

29:01.489 --> 29:05.160
And it-- it created, uh,
a difficult situation

29:05.243 --> 29:06.494
for my family.

29:06.828 --> 29:07.662
I regret it.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.586
The people that we are dealing with,

29:15.420 --> 29:16.963
they care about one thing.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.506
It's money.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.302
Helen will have you killed.

29:22.552 --> 29:25.180
She'll have our entire family killed.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.974
That's why we're doing this.

29:44.824 --> 29:45.700
Hi.

29:46.743 --> 29:47.994
I'm really sorry.

29:48.369 --> 29:49.537
Just get in the car.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.667
I'll get this up to Kansas City.

29:54.834 --> 29:56.294
I'll buy a burner later.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.172
Which direction are you gonna head?

30:01.299 --> 30:03.259
I don't know. East, I guess.

30:04.928 --> 30:05.929
I'll call you.

30:08.556 --> 30:09.557
Okay.

30:10.433 --> 30:12.143
-[Ben] I'm really sorry.
-Nope.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.658
[Ben chewing]
Sorry I fucked up your party.

30:27.617 --> 30:28.535
[Wendy] Me, too.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.704
[Ben] You're going back into politics.

30:33.122 --> 30:35.500
I always thought
you should have stayed in politics.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.919
You could have been a big deal.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.422
I could still be a big deal.

30:43.424 --> 30:45.635
-You could still be a big deal.
-Hmm.

30:46.219 --> 30:49.556
This is America. [laughing]

31:04.320 --> 31:05.613
Where can I take you?

31:08.658 --> 31:11.244
Where you can stay and get better.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.426
[sobbing]

31:55.204 --> 31:58.541
[exhales, sniffles]

31:58.625 --> 32:01.294
[laughing] Every place I go, there I am.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.092
Well, there's gonna have to be some place.

32:11.971 --> 32:13.640
[sighs]

32:20.396 --> 32:21.731
How did this happen?

32:24.317 --> 32:25.360
Well...

32:30.031 --> 32:32.075
you can't fuck with the children

32:33.326 --> 32:34.494
of powerful people.

32:36.287 --> 32:39.457
I mean, for the most part, you can't fuck
with the children of any people,

32:39.540 --> 32:40.959
but powerful people...

32:42.085 --> 32:43.544
they take it especially bad.

32:45.672 --> 32:46.756
Right.

32:48.508 --> 32:49.342
Right.

32:50.009 --> 32:50.969
But...

32:53.012 --> 32:54.305
I mean, like...

32:54.389 --> 32:56.641
[sighs] How did <i>we</i> get here?

32:58.309 --> 32:59.936
I mean, how did <i>you</i> get here?

33:04.649 --> 33:06.109
And don't you think, like...

33:07.026 --> 33:10.154
her daughter would have eventually
figured it out anyway?

33:10.238 --> 33:12.782
No, no, no.

33:12.907 --> 33:14.784
Mnh-mnh. No, I don't.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.287
And I would-- I would never let her...

33:20.623 --> 33:24.502
know I think so, but Helen--
Helen is terrifying, and...

33:27.839 --> 33:29.507
she's smarter than I am.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.766
Did I just hear a drawl?

33:41.019 --> 33:42.311
[laughs]

33:44.147 --> 33:45.273
No.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.779
Do you really think
she's smarter than you are?

33:52.905 --> 33:55.700
-No.
-[both laughing]

34:12.133 --> 34:13.092
Why do it?

34:16.846 --> 34:17.930
I told you why.

34:18.639 --> 34:19.640
Not really.

34:20.099 --> 34:21.225
[Wendy sighs]

34:21.768 --> 34:23.853
Because fighting for your life makes

34:24.062 --> 34:26.355
every other thing you ever did before...

34:28.232 --> 34:29.650
seem extremely dull.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.492
You must be tired.

34:42.038 --> 34:43.206
You'd think so.

34:49.253 --> 34:50.838
[Jonah] <i>Is something gonna happen to him?</i>

34:53.424 --> 34:54.509
Tell the truth.

34:57.136 --> 34:59.305
That's why Mom took him out of town.

34:59.514 --> 35:00.973
So that nothing bad happens.

35:03.017 --> 35:04.185
Where is she going?

35:04.268 --> 35:05.478
Someplace safe.

35:05.728 --> 35:08.648
All you guys need to do
is just relax and get some sleep.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.859
What I need to do is drive Mom's phone
to Kansas City.

35:12.819 --> 35:15.363
I'll do it. You got enough going on here.

35:16.322 --> 35:17.907
Please, that's way too dangerous.

35:18.741 --> 35:20.868
Any more dangerous than anything else?

35:52.150 --> 35:53.818
He's not fucking here.

35:58.030 --> 36:00.408
I wanted to ask you about my dad.

36:02.243 --> 36:05.496
Did he suffer at the end
when you shot him?

37:20.780 --> 37:22.782
[indistinct police radio chatter]

37:27.245 --> 37:30.206
Good morning, officer. [stammers]
Are we not allowed to sleep here?

37:30.289 --> 37:32.917
-I thought we could. I'm so sorry.
-[officer] No, that's fine.

37:33.834 --> 37:35.294
I'm here about your friend here.

37:39.006 --> 37:40.049
It's my brother.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.720
We had a report that your brother might be
in some danger.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.265
Somebody might be looking for him.

37:47.348 --> 37:50.685
That, uh, Omar Navarro was looking for him
in order to kill him.

37:50.851 --> 37:52.061
There any truth to that?

37:53.688 --> 37:54.939
[Wendy laughs]

37:55.481 --> 37:57.858
No. Goodness, no.

37:58.317 --> 38:00.695
My-- My brother's sick. He's...

38:02.947 --> 38:03.990
He's mentally ill

38:04.073 --> 38:05.992
and we just--
We just got out of the hospital,

38:06.075 --> 38:08.369
and we were just--
we were just listening to a story

38:08.452 --> 38:10.329
about Omar Navarro on NPR.

38:10.413 --> 38:13.165
So, this is all...
It's just a huge misunderstanding.

38:15.918 --> 38:18.713
I'm gonna have to ask you both
to step out of the vehicle, please, ma'am.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.966
Officer, can we please--
Can we not make this more complicated?

38:22.049 --> 38:23.551
Step out of the car, please.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.971
I'm gonna ask you a few questions.

38:27.513 --> 38:29.557
Then we're gonna take a look
inside the car.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.726
All right, all right, we can, we can...

38:32.351 --> 38:34.770
We can step outside the vehicle,
but you know,

38:35.229 --> 38:36.981
search and seizure laws now

38:37.064 --> 38:39.025
say we're not required to answer
your questions

38:39.108 --> 38:41.986
and if you want to search this vehicle,
you're gonna have to get a warrant.

38:42.778 --> 38:46.324
And that would be such a waste of time
and resources.

38:46.407 --> 38:49.243
And on a weekend, no less,
all because of you?

38:49.327 --> 38:51.829
And you know, I'd be--
I'd be really curious

38:51.912 --> 38:55.583
as to what you would cite
as cause on this warrant.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.502
What, some absolute nonsense my brother,

38:58.586 --> 39:00.546
who just got off a psychiatric hold,
by the way,

39:00.629 --> 39:03.382
just rattled off to some drifter
in a parking lot?

39:04.633 --> 39:05.509
So...

39:07.720 --> 39:09.180
can't we just let this go?

39:09.472 --> 39:10.473
Please.

39:10.931 --> 39:12.016
And you can...

39:13.392 --> 39:15.561
You can focus
your good intentions elsewhere.

39:18.230 --> 39:19.190
You a lawyer?

39:20.316 --> 39:21.192
No.

39:27.323 --> 39:29.867
Well, we have
your license plate information, so, uh...

39:31.827 --> 39:33.537
you two just be extra careful.

39:35.915 --> 39:36.957
Thank you, officer.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.428
Goddamn it.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.349
What are you trying to do to me?

39:53.766 --> 39:55.810
What would you do?
What would you do if you were me?

39:55.935 --> 39:57.395
You're like a fucking toddler.

39:57.478 --> 39:59.397
You make me wanna drink
at seven in the morning.

39:59.522 --> 40:00.731
You make me wanna drink.

40:01.148 --> 40:02.733
-I'm sorry--
-No talking.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.529
No more talking for the rest of the trip.

40:08.114 --> 40:09.949
[engine starts]

40:10.199 --> 40:12.785
-Where are we going?
-Oh, for God's sake.

40:13.035 --> 40:14.537
Jesus H. Christ.

40:22.336 --> 40:25.589
[Marty] I don't know what to tell you.
She's meeting with donors in Kansas City.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.758
[Helen] First of all, your foundation

40:27.842 --> 40:29.510
is dead in the water.
-Hmm.

40:29.593 --> 40:31.846
Nobody wants messy
where their money is concerned.

40:33.347 --> 40:35.057
What exactly do you want from me?

40:35.558 --> 40:39.353
We both know that your brother-in-law
is a danger to the organization.

40:40.020 --> 40:43.232
[stammers] Well, I disagree. He's not.
Not when he's on his medication,

40:43.315 --> 40:45.568
-and I've spoken to him--
-No. No, no, no.

40:46.861 --> 40:48.070
In our field,

40:48.946 --> 40:52.616
and I'm sorry to have to be so blunt,
but there is no room for mental illness.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.995
Ours is not an occupation
for progressives.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.414
Ours is a very conservative pursuit.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.292
[woman] Good luck.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.392
Ruth, I need to talk to you.

41:19.977 --> 41:20.936
What?

41:21.103 --> 41:23.355
Okay. Marty's asked me
to lose a bunch more money,

41:23.439 --> 41:25.941
and I can't. Like, I think
that FBI lady is onto me.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.485
So if I keep losing money...

41:27.818 --> 41:31.197
-she can--
-Sam, just get the fucking thing done.

41:31.280 --> 41:35.034
Whatever Marty said to do,
just fucking do it,

41:35.117 --> 41:37.203
and I don't want to hear another word
about it.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.873
[Sam] I don't think you understand
the stress I'm under right now.

41:40.956 --> 41:43.501
[Ruth]
Sam, I don't give a fucking rat's ass!

41:52.635 --> 41:54.762
[Helen] Because she hates me.
Is that what you want?

41:54.845 --> 41:56.180
Because she'd rather be with you?

41:56.263 --> 41:59.141
Because coming here was a terrible idea?
What the fuck do you want from me, Gene?

41:59.642 --> 42:01.977
You have both of our children.
You win. Congratulations.

42:02.061 --> 42:02.895
Fucker.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.359
[sliding door opens, shuts]

42:09.944 --> 42:12.696
She'll never be able to keep this a secret
for the rest of her life.

42:12.780 --> 42:15.074
From her father,
from her brother, it's just...

42:15.950 --> 42:17.243
[exhales]

42:18.536 --> 42:20.746
I really wish he hadn't told her.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.748
But just to be clear...

42:23.749 --> 42:26.252
Ben doesn't have to die
because of what he told Erin.

42:26.335 --> 42:29.922
Ben has to die because Erin
is not the last person he will tell.

42:31.215 --> 42:32.341
[sighs]

42:37.346 --> 42:39.098
I'm really sorry about all of this.

42:39.431 --> 42:41.100
I don't care if you're sorry.

42:42.101 --> 42:43.519
She'll never trust me again.

42:45.271 --> 42:46.313
Uh...

42:47.064 --> 42:48.357
We thought that.

42:49.608 --> 42:51.068
Your kids are different.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.237
How?

42:53.445 --> 42:54.947
Because they've always known.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.032
No, they haven't.

42:57.116 --> 42:59.076
Wendy told them soon as we came here.

42:59.618 --> 43:01.829
I wouldn't have made the same call, but...

43:02.496 --> 43:04.665
yeah. Um...

43:06.500 --> 43:07.835
You're gonna get her back.

43:09.295 --> 43:11.088
I know it doesn't seem like you will,

43:12.047 --> 43:13.173
but you will.

43:14.216 --> 43:16.802
[inhales deeply, sighs]

43:18.512 --> 43:21.181
Regardless, you know how this has to go.

43:22.933 --> 43:24.476
And if it doesn't go that way,

43:26.228 --> 43:27.730
you know how this has to go.

43:34.945 --> 43:36.488
[cell phone vibrating]

43:39.825 --> 43:40.701
Yes.

43:42.661 --> 43:44.705
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry.

43:49.126 --> 43:50.127
Okay.

43:50.210 --> 43:51.587
<i>We need to fix this.</i>

43:53.422 --> 43:56.258
<i>I want you to know</i>
<i>that I never meant to hurt your kid,</i>

43:56.925 --> 44:00.054
but the hospital is a very bad place
for me.

44:01.013 --> 44:03.307
<i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay. I understand.</i>

44:04.141 --> 44:05.351
Where are you?

44:05.684 --> 44:09.104
<i>I can come and get you,</i>
<i>and we can sort this out.</i> <i>Hmm?</i>

44:10.689 --> 44:11.899
Who were you talking to?

44:12.232 --> 44:13.233
Helen.

44:14.693 --> 44:16.987
What the fuck is wrong with you?

44:17.071 --> 44:20.115
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
Are you trying to kill my family?

44:20.616 --> 44:23.410
If you want to get killed,
go run out into the street!

44:23.577 --> 44:25.412
[stammers] Do you understand?

44:25.954 --> 44:27.373
Listen, I know I fucked up.

44:27.456 --> 44:29.041
-I'm trying to fix it.
-Oh, my God.

44:29.124 --> 44:32.127
If she doesn't get what she wants,
she will kill my children!

44:33.295 --> 44:34.797
This is not a game.

44:35.881 --> 44:36.882
This is real.

44:38.842 --> 44:40.219
It's real. Get in the car!

44:42.346 --> 44:43.847
Get in the car!

44:51.105 --> 44:52.064
Go!

44:52.773 --> 44:54.149
Get in the fucking car.

44:55.567 --> 44:57.653
[line ringing]

44:59.780 --> 45:00.906
[clicks]

45:03.283 --> 45:06.995
That was your brother-in-law.
You really need to tell me where they are.

45:15.462 --> 45:17.881
[panting]

45:17.965 --> 45:21.093
-[cell phone ringing]
-[groans]

45:24.221 --> 45:25.097
Where are you?

45:25.180 --> 45:26.974
[Wendy sobs] <i>This is a nightmare.</i>

45:27.307 --> 45:29.059
<i>I mean, where am I taking him?</i>

45:29.143 --> 45:31.270
<i>I mean, what the fuck am I doing?</i>
<i>He's not getting it.</i>

45:31.353 --> 45:33.439
<i>He's really-- he's not getting it.</i>

45:33.647 --> 45:34.898
Can you tell me where you are?

45:34.982 --> 45:36.817
Oh, what difference does it matter
where I am?

45:36.900 --> 45:38.777
I'm at some fucking rest stop.

45:40.821 --> 45:44.616
I can't-- I can't fix this. I can't.
I can't control him.

45:44.992 --> 45:46.285
Tell me what I can do.

45:47.035 --> 45:49.496
<i>You can't. You can't-- You can't help me.</i>

45:52.499 --> 45:53.542
I love you.

45:58.922 --> 45:59.923
I love you, too.

46:14.104 --> 46:17.608
[crying] You stupid, dumb, fucking idiot.

46:18.567 --> 46:21.320
[Ben continues sobbing]

46:34.249 --> 46:36.877
-Hey.
-[blubbering]

46:37.252 --> 46:40.422
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay.

46:40.881 --> 46:42.841
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

46:44.968 --> 46:45.886
[sniffles]

46:47.137 --> 46:48.555
Where can I take you?

46:48.639 --> 46:50.599
[whimpering sobs]

48:46.298 --> 48:47.758
Probably a wealthy tourist.

of the house on Fire Pink Road.

The bats.

It was a great house.

52:45.579 --> 52:46.788
Was it? [sighs]

52:46.872 --> 52:48.498
It had that big front porch.

52:48.915 --> 52:49.875
It did.

That was Lucky's porch.

54:34.896 --> 54:36.564
You're not dogs and goats.

54:37.524 --> 54:40.986
You're clearance codes
and fundraisers on yachts.

54:46.449 --> 54:47.951
That sounds terrible. [chuckles]

54:48.034 --> 54:49.869
