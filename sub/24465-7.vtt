00:12.760 --> 00:13.340
AMAZING.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.680
IT TASTES JUST LIKE WATER.
Benson: THAT'S BECAUSE IT <i>IS</i>

00:16.120 --> 00:17.860
WATER ââ 100% SAFE DRINKING

00:17.960 --> 00:19.780

00:20.880 --> 00:24.040

00:29.600 --> 00:32.720
LET ME SHOW YOU MY SYSTEM.
Rigby: CAN YOU GUYS KEEP IT

00:32.080 --> 00:34.440

Mordecai: GOOD GAME, DUDE.
GOOD GAME.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.420
Benson: GUYS, CAN YOU COME

00:41.520 --> 00:44.320
HERE FOR A SECOND?
Mordecai: AH, SWEET.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.560
BENSON'S PRESENTATION'S OVER.
Rigby: LOOK OUT, FACE.

00:45.560 --> 00:48.880
IT'S TIME TO SHOVE SOME BURGERS
IN YOUR MOUTH.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.760
Mordecai: YEAH, WATCH OUT,
BUNS, 'CAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET

00:50.080 --> 00:51.540

00:53.560 --> 00:55.020
THANKS A LOT FOR COMING TO THIS.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.200
I KNOW MY WILDERNESSâSURVIVAL
PRESENTATIONS AREN'T HOW YOU'D

00:57.400 --> 01:00.440
NORMALLY CHOOSE TO SPEND YOUR
TIME OFF.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.960
Mordecai: SURE, BENSON.
NO PROBLEM.

01:00.480 --> 01:03.160
Benson: GREAT.
SO, IF YOU CAN JUST BRING OVER

01:02.400 --> 01:05.600
THE TORTILLAS, I'LL GET STARTED
ON THE FOOD.

01:04.200 --> 01:07.320
Rigby: NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU
DON'T MAKE BURGERS WITH

01:06.240 --> 01:08.680
TORTILLAS.
Benson: WAIT.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.400
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU
DIDN'T BRING THE TORTILLAS?

01:09.440 --> 01:12.440
Rigby: WHY WOULD WE BRING
TORTILLAS FOR BURGERS?

01:11.320 --> 01:14.400
Benson: BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
HAVING BURGERS.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.860
WE'RE HAVING QUESADILLAS.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.140
Rigby: AW, WHAT?

01:16.240 --> 01:19.280
WE ONLY CAME TO THIS THING FOR
THE BURGERS AT THE END.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.880
Mordecai: YEAH.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US WE WERE

01:19.960 --> 01:21.380
HAVING QUESADILLAS THIS TIME?

01:21.480 --> 01:22.820
Benson: I DID TELL YOU ââ

01:22.920 --> 01:23.740
OVER AND OVER.

01:23.840 --> 01:24.980
I SAID, "WE'RE HAVING

01:25.080 --> 01:27.260
QUESADILLAS THIS TIME."

01:27.360 --> 01:30.440
DON'T FORGET WE'RE HAVING
QUESADILLAS THIS TIME, SO IF YOU

01:29.720 --> 01:32.960
CAN PICK UP THE TORTILLAS, I'D
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

01:31.880 --> 01:33.140
Mordecai: NO PROBLEM.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.180
Benson: HEY, GUYS.

01:34.280 --> 01:37.200
YOU'RE GONNA PICK UP THE
TORTILLAS FOR THE QUESADILLAS,

01:36.320 --> 01:36.900
RIGHT?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.380
Rigby: OH, YES!

01:38.480 --> 01:40.260
Benson: GREAT. THANK YOU.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.400
SINCE YOU GUYS ARE HEADED OUT
ANYWAY, THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD

01:42.400 --> 01:45.360
TIME TO GET THOSE TORTILLAS.
Rigby: WHAT DID HE SAY?

01:44.320 --> 01:47.480
Mordecai: I THINK, UH, "HAVE
A GOOD TIME"?

01:46.080 --> 01:49.160
MAYBE IF YOU JUST REMINDED US
ONE MORE ââ

01:47.600 --> 01:48.020
( GRUNTS )

01:48.120 --> 01:51.160
Benson: I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
REMIND YOU AT ALL!

01:50.520 --> 01:53.840
YOU TWO NEVER LISTEN TO ME, AND
I'M SICK OF IT!

01:52.560 --> 01:53.780
Rigby: DON'T BE MAD, BENSON.

01:53.880 --> 01:54.500
Benson: MAD?

01:54.600 --> 01:57.800
I GOT MAD THE LAST TIME YOU
IGNORED ME.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.100
THIS TIME, I'M ââ I'M DEEPLY

01:59.200 --> 01:59.740
OFFENDED.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.300
AND NOW I HAVE SIX POUNDS OF

02:01.400 --> 02:02.900
CHEESE AND NOT ONE TORTILLA.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.320
WHAT KIND OF QUESADILLA CAN YOU
MAKE WITH THAT, HUH?

02:05.280 --> 02:07.840
WHAT KIND?!
Skips: YOU CAN'T MAKE A

02:06.960 --> 02:08.860
QUESADILLA WITHOUT TORTILLAS.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.300
THAT'S JUST CHEESE.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.300
Benson: THANK YOU, SKIPS.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.460
SO NOW, BECAUSE OF MORDECAI AND

02:14.560 --> 02:16.700
RIGBY, HERE WE ALL ARE ââ TIRED,

02:16.800 --> 02:18.380
HUNGRY, NOTHING TO EAT.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.760
AND IF YOU TWO DON'T GET THOSE
TORTILLAS RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE

02:21.520 --> 02:23.520
FIRED!

02:26.840 --> 02:29.840
Rigby: WELL, WHICH ONES ARE
WE SUPPOSED TO GET?

02:28.480 --> 02:31.520
THERE'S LIKE 30 DIFFERENT KINDS
HERE.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.960
Mordecai: HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
Rigby: WELL, CAN YOU CHECK?

02:33.040 --> 02:36.000
Mordecai: IT'S A
BENSON.

02:34.720 --> 02:38.120
"DEAR MORDECAI AND RIGBY, YOU'RE
PROBABLY STANDING THERE LIKE TWO

02:37.480 --> 02:40.800
BONEHEADS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHICH OF THE 30 DIFFERENT KINDS

02:40.160 --> 02:43.120
OF TORTILLAS TO GET."
Rigby: HOW DOES HE KNOW?!

02:42.360 --> 02:43.500
DUDE, HE TYPED IT.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.340
"SINCE YOU NEVER LISTEN, I'LL

02:45.440 --> 02:47.020
REMIND YOU THAT WE NEED AN

IF YOU COME BACK HERE WITH
ANYTHING ELSE, YOU'RE FIRED.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.080

AND THEN THERE'S SOME CLIP ART

02:55.400 --> 02:56.580
OF A BOMB, AND IT SAYS, "THE

ACTUALLY RUNNING KIND OF LATE ON
GETTING THESE TORTILLAS BACK TO

03:22.960 --> 03:25.480
THE PARK.
Rigby: YEAH.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.200
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE THAT NEW
SHORTCUT.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.300
Mordecai: GOOD CALL.

DUDE, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST LISTEN

03:43.480 --> 03:46.680
TO BENSON AND GAS UP THE CART?
Rigby: BECAUSE HE NEVER SAYS

ANYTHING IMPORTANT?
Mordecai: EXCEPT THAT <i>WAS</i>

03:47.480 --> 03:50.520
IMPORTANT, 'CAUSE NOW WE'RE

LAND US WHERE I THOUGHT IT
WOULD.

ATTACKED HIM.
