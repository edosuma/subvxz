Remaking man in her own image,
by chopping my balls off?

37:29.790 --> 37:31.792
It's not my end of things!

37:37.173 --> 37:39.926
(WINCES) Jesus! Thank you.

37:40.009 --> 37:42.053
(SIGHS) Thank you.

37:47.683 --> 37:48.809
No.

37:51.103 --> 37:52.480
(SIGHS)

37:55.441 --> 37:56.609
I'll work for you.

37:56.692 --> 37:59.612
Every case we found
with Brightborn connections,

37:59.695 --> 38:01.280
you were the investigator.

38:01.364 --> 38:04.617
You're a corrupt
and mercenary man, Detective.

38:04.700 --> 38:08.412
Subjects murdered,
witnesses disappeared.

38:09.956 --> 38:12.208
They threatened my family.

38:12.291 --> 38:13.501
My little niece.

38:13.584 --> 38:16.462
And paid you well, to your
Cayman account. We found that, too.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.547
They said they'd kill her.

38:18.631 --> 38:23.427
My niece, Meline, is, like, 10.
She has no one.

38:23.511 --> 38:24.511
It's a pretty name.

38:24.553 --> 38:27.390
I had to take that money.
I put it aside for her.

38:27.473 --> 38:30.601
- So she'd be taken care of.
- Exactly.

38:30.685 --> 38:33.104
(EXHALES) It's about family.

38:33.646 --> 38:34.939
Oh, I get it.

38:41.404 --> 38:42.863
No, no. No.

38:42.947 --> 38:44.865
- No, no.
- This is for my ma.

38:44.949 --> 38:45.992
No, no, no, no...

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

39:15.104 --> 39:16.480
SCOTT: Hey.

39:18.691 --> 39:20.443
Cosima's downstairs.

39:20.526 --> 39:22.695
Sarah, this is big.

39:29.160 --> 39:33.414
We couldn't get my cells
to create a useable culture.

39:33.497 --> 39:36.751
But I figured that
if we match a fertile LEDA egg...

39:36.834 --> 39:39.336
That's the part I don't like. My egg.

39:39.420 --> 39:42.590
...with CASTOR, yes.
So totally out of line.

39:42.673 --> 39:47.261
But that's the two parts of
Kendall Malone's biology, re-joined.

39:47.344 --> 39:49.972
So fertilize my egg with CASTOR sperm.

39:50.056 --> 39:52.391
- That's your eureka moment?
- Yeah.

39:52.475 --> 39:54.185
Don't mess with me, Cos.

39:54.268 --> 39:57.354
I'm not. I'm really not.

39:59.315 --> 40:01.525
This is the breakthrough
we've been waiting for.

40:04.403 --> 40:05.654
Is it?

40:07.656 --> 40:08.824
(SIGHS)

40:08.908 --> 40:12.828
The only problem is we don't have
the resources to do it alone.

40:15.039 --> 40:17.124
Oh, shit, what are you doing?

40:18.667 --> 40:20.169
Cosima's coming here?

40:20.252 --> 40:23.297
I look forward to working with her.
She's a deft mind.

40:23.380 --> 40:25.758
Her proposal's quite elegant, really.

40:25.841 --> 40:29.929
Yes, I'm sure you're very excited
about your contribution, Ira.

40:30.012 --> 40:31.138
Anything for science.

40:32.014 --> 40:33.641
Science isn't everything.

40:34.225 --> 40:36.185
Certainly not Evie Cho's science.

40:36.268 --> 40:38.187
There's still time to stop her.

(SIGHS)

40:43.818 --> 40:45.903
I want to go back, Mother.

40:46.987 --> 40:50.616
I want to work with Sarah Manning
and the others to restore you

40:50.699 --> 40:52.409
as the head of Neolution.

40:52.493 --> 40:53.869
They need Evie

40:54.954 --> 40:56.914
removed as much as...

41:00.960 --> 41:02.294
Oh.

41:02.378 --> 41:03.546
Are you all right, Rachel?

41:03.629 --> 41:04.797
(SIGHS)

41:12.221 --> 41:13.556
Yes.

41:13.639 --> 41:15.307
Yes, I'm fine.

41:16.892 --> 41:19.186
Are you sure you can work with Sarah?

41:21.522 --> 41:23.315
I look forward to it.

COSIMA: Great. Tell her,
her eggs are airborne.

41:31.740 --> 41:33.284
<i>Oh, man.</i>

41:33.367 --> 41:35.411
(CHUCKLING) Scott,
I wish you could see this.

41:35.494 --> 41:38.330
I've never been this far north.
It's amazing!

41:38.414 --> 41:40.100
SCOTT: <i>Have you thought about
how insane you are?</i>

41:40.124 --> 41:42.501
Jumping in a chopper
to a mad scientist's private island?

41:42.585 --> 41:45.296
Dude, we are mad scientists.
Don't be a hater.

41:45.379 --> 41:47.882
(CHUCKLES) Now you're really scaring me.

41:47.965 --> 41:50.092
(LAUGHS) Where's your
sense of adventure, Scott?

41:50.176 --> 41:52.761
I just want you to find a cure.

41:54.972 --> 41:56.223
We will.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.320
Two hundred and sixty new jobs.

42:09.403 --> 42:11.238
The government approvals
have come through.

42:11.322 --> 42:12.406
Then we should act now.

42:12.489 --> 42:13.574
Oh, Donnie.

42:13.657 --> 42:14.718
- (DONNIE MOANS)
- Thank God.

42:14.742 --> 42:16.702
- COSIMA: I don't wanna screw this up.
- Relax.

42:16.785 --> 42:19.747
We're merely fertilizing
LEDA with CASTOR.

42:19.830 --> 42:21.707
TRINA: You were right about Brightborn.

42:21.790 --> 42:23.334
It's way worse than I thought.

42:23.834 --> 42:24.835
It's over, Felix.

42:24.919 --> 42:26.754
Hey, Helena!

42:26.837 --> 42:28.297
Oh, Lord!

42:28.964 --> 42:30.341
Hello, Rachel.

42:30.424 --> 42:31.842
This is a bad idea.
