10:11.088 --> 10:12.916
Yeah, this is
gonna be good.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.614
Well, not to be
the negative one,

10:14.701 --> 10:17.747
but...
what's the downside?

10:17.834 --> 10:20.097
When I used it,
I found Fluffy,

10:20.184 --> 10:22.926
but I lost track of
other stuff,
like my homework.

10:23.013 --> 10:25.755
Eh. It's no biggie.
I'm used to losing things
anyway.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.714
Well, it wasn't
always things.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.933
Sometimes
I lost track of time,

10:30.020 --> 10:32.588
or lost track of
what I was saying.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.112
- It's not a perfect spell.
- We don't have a choice.

10:35.199 --> 10:37.593
We can't just let someone
run around town with our book.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.682
Especially if they
know how to use it.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.031
Be on the alert for signs.

10:41.118 --> 10:43.468
The book may not
just appear,

10:43.555 --> 10:46.950
but there will be signs
pointing you in
the right direction.

10:47.037 --> 10:49.649
Now, let yourself out.
I have a piano lesson
to teach.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.826
Actually, my dad is
home all the time now.

10:52.913 --> 10:55.002
We can't cook there.

10:55.089 --> 10:58.309
You think it would be okay
if we borrow your kitchen?

10:58.396 --> 11:00.268
I guess.
As long as you clean up.

11:03.445 --> 11:06.361
♪♪

11:27.730 --> 11:29.166
These look good.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.428
I wish they
weren't magical

11:30.515 --> 11:31.821
so I could have
more than one.

11:31.908 --> 11:32.822
Ready?

11:36.565 --> 11:37.871
Mm.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.873
I'm not getting
anything. You?

11:39.960 --> 11:42.571
Just some peanut butter
sticking to the roof of
my mouth.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.878
Maybe if we close our eyes,
we'll get a flash.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.231
Maybe
it didn't work.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.886
Well, Miss Silvers said
to stay on the look out
for signs.

12:01.938 --> 12:06.029
Grocery store,
grocery store.
Grocery store?

12:06.116 --> 12:08.640
So? Miss Silvers
needs to buy food.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.816
No, this wasn't
on here before.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.295
I noticed it
when we were cooking,

12:11.382 --> 12:13.863
and all it said was
"butter, milk and coffee."

12:16.605 --> 12:17.824
Look at this.

12:20.565 --> 12:23.264
"Grocery Store
in A minor."

12:23.351 --> 12:25.353
The grocery store
must be a sign.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.876
Oh, it's a sign,
all right.

12:26.963 --> 12:29.052
A very, very
cool sign.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.706
Come on.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.752
How do we know
who has our book?

12:32.839 --> 12:34.710
We can't just
go up to people
and ask them.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.625
Just look for
someone suspicious,
I guess.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.801
That guy looks shady.

12:38.888 --> 12:40.890
So does that guy.

12:40.977 --> 12:42.674
Whoa. Guys, look,
another sign.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.201
Someone stole the book?

12:47.288 --> 12:49.681
Oh, we prefer
temporarily relocated it.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.683
Well, it wasn't me,
in case you're wondering.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.164
We know, Mama P.
The spell brought us here.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.949
Maybe one of
your customers has it.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.994
If you're going to
accuse anyone,

12:58.081 --> 13:00.344
start with
mister chef salad
by the window.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.782
He's been
taking up a table
for two hours.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.784
Do you know his name?

13:04.871 --> 13:07.569
- Gus. I'm joking.
- [sighs]

13:07.656 --> 13:10.920
I'm sure you'll
find the book,
I have faith in you.

13:11.007 --> 13:13.575
Afternoon, Mama P.
Here you go.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.011
Thanks, Dan.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.753
Whoo. Sure is a hot
Delish Dogs day out there.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.323
What did he just say?

13:22.410 --> 13:24.542
It's a hot day out.

13:24.629 --> 13:27.241
I'm pretty sure he said
a hot delish dogs day out.

13:27.328 --> 13:29.939
Delish Dogs is
a hot dog cart on Eighth.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.506
I go there with Dad
all the time.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.813
The turkey chili cheese dogs
are close to perfection.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.423
Well, it looks like
we're one step behind

13:35.510 --> 13:36.467
whoever took the book.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.513
Off to Delish Dogs we go.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.471
Kelly, where are you going?
Your shift's about to start.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.647
Oh, right. Sorry.

13:42.734 --> 13:43.735
Get your apron,
I need your help.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.085
A bunch of girls
decided to have

13:45.172 --> 13:47.174
a birthday celebration
at table nine.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.002
Yikes.
They left a mess.

13:49.089 --> 13:51.656
- Sorry, guys.
- It's okay.

13:51.743 --> 13:54.224
Darby and I will
keep looking for it.

13:54.311 --> 13:56.139
- Let's go.
- Uh, actually,

13:56.226 --> 13:58.098
I have my audition
this afternoon.

13:58.185 --> 13:59.795
But I won't take long.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.318
Don't worry.
I check out
the hot dog cart

14:01.405 --> 14:02.319
on my way to
the museum.

14:02.406 --> 14:03.843
Thanks.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.497
I am no longer
Darby O'Brien.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.760
[British accent]
I am chief inspector
Victoria Langham.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.458
People may underestimate
my abilities

14:10.545 --> 14:11.938
because of my
short stature,

14:12.025 --> 14:13.940
but that would be
a grave mistake.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.332
[giggling]

14:15.419 --> 14:17.291
- You're gonna do great.
- Thanks.

14:19.206 --> 14:21.556
Okay, Darby.
Whenever you're ready.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.610
[British accent]
I was strolling
in the garden

14:32.697 --> 14:34.699
when I saw
Lord Abernathy and--

14:37.746 --> 14:38.965
It's actually
Lord Cumberland.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.837
Right. Sorry.
Just nervous.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.840
Take your time.
Start again.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.059
[British accent]
I was strolling
in the garden

14:46.146 --> 14:48.191
when I saw
Lord Cumberland and--

14:48.278 --> 14:51.238
and Mr.-- Mr.--

14:51.325 --> 14:52.587
I don't know
what's happening.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.502
I swear I know these
backwards and forwards.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.504
Just take a look
at your script.

14:56.591 --> 14:57.853
Just relax.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.205
I was walking
in the garden

15:02.292 --> 15:04.120
when I murdered
Lord Cumberland and--

15:04.207 --> 15:05.382
- [laughter]
- Wait. Murdered,

15:05.469 --> 15:06.731
that-- that's
not right.

15:06.818 --> 15:08.908
Um, did I say
strolling or walking?

15:08.995 --> 15:10.170
Darby.
Darby, stop.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.262
Oh, no. I forgot
the accent, didn't I?

15:15.349 --> 15:17.351
And the lines,
I'm afraid.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.222
We have more people
to audition.

15:19.309 --> 15:20.876
Would you like to take
a few minutes outside,

15:20.963 --> 15:22.834
and collect yourself?

15:22.922 --> 15:25.272
No, I don't think so.

15:25.359 --> 15:26.926
This was a mistake.
I never should have
auditioned.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.158
Can I help you?

15:42.245 --> 15:44.508
I actually
don't think you can.

15:44.595 --> 15:45.857
But as long as
I'm here,

15:45.945 --> 15:47.337
I guess I'll have
a veggie dog.

15:47.424 --> 15:50.993
Okay.
You want cheese on that?
Maybe some chili?

15:51.080 --> 15:52.821
Um, no thanks,
just ketchup.

15:59.523 --> 16:00.524
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.749
"Timber Books"?

16:07.836 --> 16:10.099
Seriously?
A book store?

16:10.186 --> 16:11.666
[sighs]

16:13.015 --> 16:14.321
Hm. Not bad.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.238
Excuse me.
What is this?

16:18.325 --> 16:19.979
Turkey sandwich,
mustard, hold the mayo,

16:20.066 --> 16:21.589
and a side cup
of fruit.

16:21.676 --> 16:24.374
I ordered a
vegetarian sandwich
with chips.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.942
Oh, uh, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.552
I-- I must have taken
your order down wrong.

16:28.639 --> 16:32.339
Let me redo it.
It'll only take
a few minutes.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.297
Have this to
tide you over.

16:34.384 --> 16:35.298
On the house.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.000
Table four's unhappy.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.088
They didn't like
the chili?

16:42.175 --> 16:43.350
They didn't order
the chili.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.874
They ordered a ham
and cheese croissant.

16:45.961 --> 16:47.789
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.835
I will give this to them
on the house.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.359
What's with you today?

16:52.446 --> 16:54.056
You've been making mistakes
all over the place.

16:54.143 --> 16:55.753
You gave table two
table six's food,

16:55.840 --> 16:57.581
table eight got an omelet
instead of oatmeal,

16:57.668 --> 16:59.496
and don't even
get me started on
what you gave table 12.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.456
I don't know.
I'm usually really good
at remembering orders.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.371
I told you to
always write it down.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.460
That's the thing,
I am.

17:06.547 --> 17:07.765
Here.
On the house.

17:12.901 --> 17:15.643
Wh-- No tip.
What did I forget
to give them?

17:15.730 --> 17:17.775
Their food.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.516
I'm sorry for
whatever I did.
Um--

17:21.257 --> 17:22.214
Here.
On the house.

17:24.955 --> 17:27.568
By the way,
you know on the house
means on Kelly. Right?

17:30.875 --> 17:33.139
So you froze, Darby,
it happens.

17:33.226 --> 17:34.444
But I knew my lines.

17:34.531 --> 17:35.750
I was up all night
practicing them.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.273
It was the spell.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.450
Don't worry, Darby,
there will be other plays.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.539
I don't know why
we're always one step
behind the book,

17:42.626 --> 17:44.063
but we need to
figure it out.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.542
Clearly, we're suffering
the downside of a spell.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.196
Not Hannah.

17:47.283 --> 17:48.937
How come you're not
losing track of anything?

17:49.024 --> 17:51.070
Probably because
I always keep
a list on hand.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.462
See? In my
note section.

17:52.549 --> 17:54.682
Things that I have to do,
things that matter,

17:54.769 --> 17:56.205
and things I'm
grateful for.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.294
Wow, must be hard
being you.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.035
Look at the top
of your list.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.993
- "Go to museum."
- Oh, no.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.648
- I totally--
- Lost track of time?

18:04.735 --> 18:05.823
Come on, let's go to
the book store.

18:05.910 --> 18:06.955
If we can't find
the book there,

18:07.042 --> 18:08.087
then we'll
look for a sign.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.788
Look.
That's our book.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.746
[giggling]

18:17.922 --> 18:20.273
Well,
it was our book.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.798
That was weird.
The drawing just
disappeared.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.016
And it didn't
give us a clue.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.149
The spell just broke.

18:27.236 --> 18:28.194
You're right.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.065
I suddenly remember
my lines.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.936
You didn't freeze.

18:32.023 --> 18:34.548
The spell caused you
to forget your lines.

18:34.635 --> 18:37.072
Yeah, and I lost track of
everyone's orders.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.293
The museum just closed.

18:40.380 --> 18:43.470
I can't believe
I blew a chance to
improve my grade.

18:43.557 --> 18:46.168
Why did it break when
we haven't found the book?

18:46.255 --> 18:47.735
Come on.
Let's go.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.218
It doesn't make sense.
We-- We can't find the book,

18:52.305 --> 18:54.002
and now the spell
is broken.

18:54.089 --> 18:56.744
Well, who stole it?
Obviously, we're close.

18:56.831 --> 18:59.355
Maybe it wasn't stolen
after all.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.314
Well, it didn't just
fall out of Kelly's bag.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.490
That's not what I meant.

19:03.577 --> 19:07.276
Maybe the book just...
left you.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.453
What?
No way.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.542
The book decides
who the protectors are,

19:12.629 --> 19:14.762
and for how long.

19:14.849 --> 19:18.157
You said a few girls had a
birthday party at Mama P's,

19:18.244 --> 19:20.768
and that three girls
came out of the book store.

19:20.855 --> 19:23.423
Which is when the symbol
on the sign disappeared.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.468
They must have had
the book.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.166
But why would the book
leave us now?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.080
I mean, we haven't even
had it for that long.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.431
It's not up to us
to know why.

19:31.518 --> 19:34.042
Well, we haven't been using it
for the past couple months,

19:34.129 --> 19:36.262
maybe it figured
it should move on.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.307
But there were
so many recipes
I wanted to try.

19:38.394 --> 19:39.656
Like Itchy Ice Cream.

19:39.743 --> 19:42.224
We still have
a lot to learn
about magic.

19:42.311 --> 19:43.617
Oh, I've been
dreading this moment.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.096
We could have helped
so many more people,

19:45.184 --> 19:47.055
and done
so much more good
with the book.

19:47.142 --> 19:50.014
Did the book leave us
because we didn't do
a good job?

19:50.101 --> 19:51.712
Don't be sad, girls.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.714
There is life
after magic.

19:53.801 --> 19:54.715
Look at me.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.023
I'm sorry about
my audition.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.634
Oh, you were nervous.

20:00.721 --> 20:03.027
Actually, I wasn't,
but that isn't important.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.159
Can I do it for you now?

20:04.246 --> 20:06.466
Oh, I'm sorry, Darby,

20:06.553 --> 20:08.990
but I already
cast the role.

20:09.077 --> 20:11.688
Oh, uh, well,
can I audition for
another part?

20:11.775 --> 20:14.169
I'm afraid all of the parts
have been assigned.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.171
But maybe next time.

20:16.258 --> 20:19.740
Look, I really love
the theater.

20:19.827 --> 20:22.351
If I can't be an actor,
I'd still like to be
a part of it.

20:22.438 --> 20:23.787
I'm willing to do
whatever is needed.

20:23.874 --> 20:26.312
I really love
the attitude.

20:26.399 --> 20:28.966
Maybe you can
help build sets.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.098
Oh.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.244
Another free muffin?

20:45.331 --> 20:47.637
Relax, they actually
ordered that one.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.335
And look.
Got a 20 percent tip.

20:49.422 --> 20:50.988
There you go.

20:51.075 --> 20:54.383
Yeah.
Now I only owe Mama P
another $22.50

20:54.470 --> 20:55.906
for all the food
I gave away.

20:55.993 --> 20:57.865
[school bell rings]

21:02.913 --> 21:04.350
Hannah.

21:04.437 --> 21:07.091
[sighs]

21:07.178 --> 21:08.528
Hi, Mr. Morris.

21:10.181 --> 21:11.487
Where's your paper?

21:11.574 --> 21:14.098
That. Right.

21:14.185 --> 21:16.449
See, the thing is,
by the time that I
got to the museum,

21:16.536 --> 21:18.755
it was already closed
for the day.

21:18.842 --> 21:21.671
You asked for
a chance, Hannah.
I gave it to you.

21:21.758 --> 21:24.761
I promise you this class is
very important to me.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.851
Uh, this is so unlike me.
I keep lists and everything.

21:27.938 --> 21:29.418
Well, if it's
that important to you,

21:29.505 --> 21:32.029
you're gonna have to start
working a lot harder.

21:32.116 --> 21:33.727
I'm not impressed.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.381
I understand.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.078
I hope so.

21:37.165 --> 21:38.471
[door closes]

21:41.865 --> 21:42.866
Hi, Dad.

21:42.953 --> 21:45.129
Hi, Kell.
Everything okay?

21:45.216 --> 21:47.131
You look down.

21:47.218 --> 21:48.655
No, I'm fine.
You?

21:48.742 --> 21:50.178
You kidding?

21:50.265 --> 21:52.223
It's 5:00 and
dinner's in the oven.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.487
I cleaned up the attic and
now I'm watching the news.

21:54.574 --> 21:56.010
I love working from home.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.273
That's great.
It smells good.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.884
Oh, hey, look.
I know that guy.

22:00.971 --> 22:03.931
Well, thanks, Ron.
This local man had
a good day.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.933
RJ White bought
the winning ticket

22:06.020 --> 22:08.152
in the Saffron Falls
lottery,

22:08.239 --> 22:11.460
and then later,
he spent some of that
at the race track

22:11.547 --> 22:15.638
where he unbelievably
won the trifecta.

22:15.725 --> 22:18.337
I don't know,
I guess it's just
my lucky day.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.513
That's the kook I met
at Mama P's

22:20.600 --> 22:23.298
who tried to convince me
Grandma was under
a magic spell.

22:23.385 --> 22:25.822
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

22:25.909 --> 22:28.956
...maybe go shopping
for some new shoes.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.959
I don't believe he won
both of those in one day.

22:32.046 --> 22:33.787
I bet he cheated.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.397
I guarantee you
he cheated.
