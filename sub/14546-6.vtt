09:21.310 --> 09:23.104
Well, we heard your New York

09:23.145 --> 09:24.522
friends were in town

09:24.564 --> 09:26.357
so we thought we would bada bing

09:26.399 --> 09:29.402
and that we would
forget about it!

09:29.443 --> 09:30.945
Do you,
do you know these clowns?

09:30.987 --> 09:33.447
Uh, yes. A-Actually,
this is my neighbor Fred.

09:33.489 --> 09:37.451
Vinnie Boombatz, but folks
around here call me "Cha-Cha"

09:37.493 --> 09:40.580
on account of me being
the best dancer in Chatswin.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.332
Dig?

09:43.374 --> 09:44.792
- Pardon us.
- Mm.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.295
Guys?

09:47.336 --> 09:48.796
What, what has gotten
into you two?

09:48.838 --> 09:50.214
Look, we just
wanted to show your friends

09:50.256 --> 09:52.758
how cool us Chatswinelenos
could be

09:52.800 --> 09:54.260
and for some reason,
Fred thought that meant

09:54.302 --> 09:56.095
dressing up like
a 1950s greaser.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.639
I'll have you know
that Vinnie Boombatz was a hit

09:58.681 --> 10:02.560
at last year's "Grease" themed
fund-raiser for cystic fibrosis.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.062
We just didn't want you
to be embarrassed of us, George.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.314
I'm-I'm sorry, you did

10:06.355 --> 10:08.274
or you didn't
want me to be embarrassed?

10:10.401 --> 10:12.236
- Didn't.
- Didn't. I..

10:12.278 --> 10:14.030
Yikes.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.323
Dude, I know
you're counting down the days

10:15.364 --> 10:16.866
'until Tessa turns 18.'

10:16.907 --> 10:18.576
I mean, once she leaves,
you ain't got nothing

10:18.618 --> 10:20.661
keeping you here
with Vinnie Boombatz.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.038
Aye!

10:22.079 --> 10:23.456
Well, a-actually, I think--

10:23.497 --> 10:25.374
I mean, the burgers are okay.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.586
But this place
is full of phonies.

10:28.628 --> 10:32.214
Fake nose, fake boobs,
fake tan, fake hair.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.299
No, I know.
Tell me about it.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.260
- And all on one chick.
- Yeah.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.511
Oh, that chick.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.347
(Dallas)
'Oh!'

10:39.388 --> 10:40.931
Well, hiya, hunk.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.643
Hi. Guys,
this is Dallas, my girlfriend.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.895
Dallas,
this is Theo and Cyrus.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.521
- Hi.
- We used to work together.

10:47.563 --> 10:51.067
Oh, it's just super, super-duper

10:51.108 --> 10:53.361
meeting some of George's
New York friends.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.946
In fact,
this might be a double duper

10:55.988 --> 10:59.158
which would make it
super-super-duper-duper.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.995
Yeah, well, okay, sweetheart,
um, I'm a little worried

11:03.037 --> 11:04.830
they're gonna run out
of the chocolate volcanoes.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.624
- Would you?
- Ooh! Good call.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.378
I'm on it, cuz.
Manhattan, I love it.

11:12.546 --> 11:16.967
Well, she is just super, George.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.886
Mm. No. No. Super-duper.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.472
Okay, so you guys
are kidding, but she is.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.432
I don't get it, are,
are you dating her

11:23.474 --> 11:25.059
like, ironically--

11:25.101 --> 11:26.352
Oh, no, or, or
are you writing some

11:26.394 --> 11:29.021
kind of a long-form humor essay?

11:29.063 --> 11:31.649
Okay, look, you can make fun
of my Crescent rolls

11:31.691 --> 11:34.652
and-and my gardening implements
and even Vinnie Boombatz.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.945
(Fred)
'Aye!'

11:35.986 --> 11:38.197
But that woman is warm,
and she is kind

11:38.239 --> 11:40.241
and she will do anything
for the people she cares about.

11:40.282 --> 11:43.119
You guys have been in Chatswin,
what, all of three hours?

11:43.160 --> 11:45.579
And-and you have everyone
here pegged. You know what?

11:45.621 --> 11:48.708
Why don't you just head back
to midtown, where you came from?

11:50.376 --> 11:52.378
(Theo)
'Well, good luck
with everything, Skylight King.'

11:52.420 --> 11:55.673
And, hey, if we need a sellout
to, uh, put in a roof window

11:55.715 --> 11:56.716
we'll give you a call.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.926
Oh, really? A-a roof window?

11:58.968 --> 12:01.512
Yeah,
because that's all they are.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.763
Boom.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.231
Oh! Wow!

12:12.273 --> 12:16.110
As far as I am concerned,
nobody exaggerates and distorts

12:16.152 --> 12:19.071
the essence of any person,
animal, or object quite

12:19.113 --> 12:20.322
like old Charlie here.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.866
I have to go to the bathroom.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.576
Oh, perfect, because I
actually wanted Charlie

12:23.617 --> 12:25.161
to do a couple of candid shots

12:25.202 --> 12:27.663
like maybe I could be in
the background shaving my legs.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.458
No, Lisa, this is something
that I have to do alone.

12:33.711 --> 12:37.256
Uh, hello, Mrs. Shay.

12:37.298 --> 12:40.843
This is, Fire Inspector..

12:42.553 --> 12:45.014
...Charmin.

12:45.055 --> 12:48.893
Well, we have received a report

12:48.934 --> 12:52.605
about a possible safety hazard.

12:52.646 --> 12:53.856
I'm so sorry, Tessa.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.025
I know how much
this night meant to you!

12:56.066 --> 12:58.736
(Tessa)
Part of me felt bad
for ratting out Lisa.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.113
Come here, sexy.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.823
But most of me just
wanted to get back

13:02.865 --> 13:04.617
to the main man in my life.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.455
Those guys
don't take me seriously.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.291
Oop. Sorry, baby. You got
chocolate sauce on your head.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.586
Let me tell you something.
I went to college with Theo.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.880
I'm twice the architect he is
and Cyrus is like

13:17.922 --> 13:20.716
the least creative dude I know.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.594
Then why don't you just
out-whatever those losers

13:23.636 --> 13:26.472
on whatever it is
they're whatever-ing?

13:26.514 --> 13:28.098
What do you mean?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.267
Undercut their bid on the
Scarsdale performing arts center

13:30.309 --> 13:32.645
addition by presenting
something more cost-effective

13:32.686 --> 13:35.022
but equally
striking aesthetically?

13:35.064 --> 13:37.149
Yeah, George.
That's what I said.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.945
[heart beating]

13:44.532 --> 13:46.325
(fish)
'Tessa.'

13:48.619 --> 13:50.913
Hello?

13:50.955 --> 13:53.040
(fish)
'Tessa.'

13:56.210 --> 13:58.170
[intense music]

14:05.427 --> 14:06.887
Friendship, Tessa.

14:06.929 --> 14:10.808
I gave my life for it,
and you threw it back!

14:10.850 --> 14:12.434
[screaming]

14:12.476 --> 14:13.894
[laughing]

14:19.066 --> 14:21.151
(Tessa)
At that moment,
I realized two things.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.529
One, my relationship
with electronics

14:23.571 --> 14:26.448
was overshadowing
my relationship with Lisa.

14:26.490 --> 14:29.994
And two, I was reading
way too much Poe.

14:34.665 --> 14:35.833
[instrumental music]

14:43.048 --> 14:45.134
You know, George,
I'm no expert on the subject

14:45.175 --> 14:47.386
but from where I stand
you are architecturing

14:47.428 --> 14:50.306
the hell out of those designs.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.766
Oh, just triple the number
of ladies' rooms

14:52.808 --> 14:54.435
and you've got yourself
a winner.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.649
(Tessa)
The next morning, I decided
to take the fish's advice

15:00.691 --> 15:02.610
and make things
right with Lisa.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.361
I'm not home.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.406
Hey. What is with the outfit?

15:07.448 --> 15:10.576
Got sentenced to roadside
cleanup after my mom found out

15:10.618 --> 15:13.704
about the unlicensed smoker
in my closet.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.747
About that.

15:16.832 --> 15:19.043
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's not your fault.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.879
If Fire Inspector Charmin hadn't
been so damn good at his job--

15:21.921 --> 15:25.799
No, that's me.
I'm Fire Inspector Charmin.

15:25.841 --> 15:28.093
I'm the one who ratted you out.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.428
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.223
I just didn't want to sing
any more Bette Midler songs.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.392
What?

15:35.434 --> 15:37.186
I don't understand.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.271
The divine Miss M
has cornered the market

15:39.313 --> 15:40.481
on songs about friendship.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.399
Ask anybody
who's ever had a friend.

15:42.441 --> 15:46.153
Look, Lisa, ever since you
and Malik hooked up

15:46.195 --> 15:48.697
you and I have been spending
a lot less time together

15:48.739 --> 15:50.115
and I'm not mad.

15:50.157 --> 15:53.744
I'm not mad, but I adapted.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.371
I started my own relationship.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.210
You got a lot of nerve showing
up here with that e-reader.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.379
It's a tablet, Lisa.

16:04.713 --> 16:08.092
A really versatile tablet..

16:08.133 --> 16:09.718
...with a full-sized USB port

16:09.760 --> 16:12.346
and an integrated kickstand

16:12.388 --> 16:14.139
and a really sizable hard drive.

16:16.100 --> 16:19.895
I get it, I mean, it was there
for you when I wasn't

16:19.937 --> 16:22.606
and unlike me,
it doesn't just show up

16:22.648 --> 16:24.441
when its boyfriend
is out of town.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.195
I'm really happy for you guys.

16:29.905 --> 16:32.491
You look really cute together.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.617
So if you'll excuse me

16:33.659 --> 16:34.868
I have to go pick up tampon

16:34.910 --> 16:36.370
applicators in the park.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.500
Lisa, wait.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.752
There is one thing
this tablet can't do.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.922
Pick up tampon applicators
in the park?

16:46.964 --> 16:48.382
Okay, two things.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.845
It can't eat friendship fish
with its best friend.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.641
Well, not this generation,
anyway.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.476
Friends forever.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.020
Friends forever.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.231
[instrumental music]

17:04.273 --> 17:07.276
Wow. That is smoky.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.861
Mmm! That is super smoky.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.154
Mm-hmm.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.947
But not bad.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.782
You can taste the friendship.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.037
(male #1)
'Let's go! Let's go!'

17:18.078 --> 17:19.329
What did this to you?

17:19.371 --> 17:21.457
What-what did you ingest?

17:21.498 --> 17:23.250
Friendship.

17:23.292 --> 17:24.293
[vomiting]

17:27.588 --> 17:28.756
[instrumental music]

17:33.761 --> 17:35.888
Tessa, I'm so sorry.

17:35.929 --> 17:40.267
Apparently, you're only supposed
to smoke fish for four hours..

17:40.309 --> 17:42.394
...not four weeks.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.898
It was an innocent mistake,
Lisa.

17:45.939 --> 17:47.191
Why didn't you get sick?

17:47.232 --> 17:49.193
Oh, we Shays have iron stomachs.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.778
It's our bodies way
of compensating

17:50.819 --> 17:52.780
for our diminished sense
of taste.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.658
We still can't
get a hold of your dad

17:56.700 --> 17:59.953
and unfortunately,
we won't be able to release you

17:59.995 --> 18:03.373
until a family member
signs your discharge papers.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.542
You're sure there's no one
else we can call?

18:08.378 --> 18:11.465
And finally,
a columned subsidiary space

18:11.507 --> 18:13.801
'alongside the body
of the main building'

18:13.842 --> 18:17.429
would lead from the atrium
to the concert hall.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.932
Well done, Mr. Altman, you've
really opened up the space

18:19.973 --> 18:21.558
with your use of skylights.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.520
And I, for one, appreciate
the abundance of ladies' rooms.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.313
Oh, thank you,
that, that happens to be

18:26.355 --> 18:28.732
my beautiful associate's idea.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.110
Along with
the bedazzled borders.

18:31.151 --> 18:34.404
It's amazing how some glue
and a few crappy plastic beads

18:34.446 --> 18:36.490
can really class up any project.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.575
- Oh, it's true. It's true.
- Mm-hmm.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.329
[instrumental music]

18:55.134 --> 18:56.760
Oh, shoot.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.846
Tessa? Hey. I'm sorry.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.347
Are you okay?
I didn't get your messages.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.141
'Are you okay? What happened?
Are you okay?'

19:02.182 --> 19:04.268
For the love of God, would you
tell me if you're okay?

19:04.309 --> 19:06.436
- I'm okay, George.
- Okay.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.897
I just had a mild deadly case
of food poisoning.

19:08.939 --> 19:11.108
Ohh.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.402
I don't believe this. I'm
so sorry I wasn't there for you.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.529
How'd you get home? Sheila?

19:15.571 --> 19:17.030
Well, actually,
they wouldn't release me

19:17.072 --> 19:19.616
without a family
member's consent, so..

19:20.284 --> 19:21.285
Helen.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.078
Yes, George.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.664
Oh, happy to help out.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.374
The hospital couldn't reach you.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.709
Tessa got a little frantic

19:28.750 --> 19:31.003
and so she called
her grandmother.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.046
Well, that's great.

19:33.088 --> 19:35.966
So...thanks.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.511
You don't have to do that.
I got it from here, Helen.

19:39.553 --> 19:42.890
Oh, you might as well get used
to me being around again George

19:42.931 --> 19:46.268
because this time,
I'm not going anywhere.

19:48.770 --> 19:49.813
Great.

19:49.855 --> 19:50.898
When you're in danger of losing

19:50.939 --> 19:52.149
someone you care about

19:52.191 --> 19:53.650
often, you'll do anything

19:53.692 --> 19:55.569
to re-establish a connection.

19:55.611 --> 20:00.115
For Malik, that meant sculpting
a bust of Lisa's head.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.743
One for every day
they weren't together.

♪ I've been alone
with you inside my mind ♪

20:10.209 --> 20:14.588
♪ And in my dreams

(Tessa)
For George, it meant
focusing less on work

20:27.392 --> 20:30.520
and more on breakfast.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.813
Goodbye.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.024
So you got the bid.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.735
- Nope.
- Oh.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.862
- Sorry.
- Ah, it's fine.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.405
Considering how little time
I had I think

20:40.447 --> 20:42.241
I did a pretty great job.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.742
It just felt good, you know

20:43.784 --> 20:47.246
to get the creative
juices flowing again.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.373
And more importantly, Theo
and Cyrus didn't get it either

20:49.414 --> 20:52.751
so their failure
is victory enough for me.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.586
- That's the spirit.
- 'Mm-hmm.'

20:54.628 --> 20:56.672
Honestly, though, Tess..

20:56.713 --> 20:58.382
...I'm not
the same person I was.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.759
There was a time
when I was..

21:00.801 --> 21:03.220
...completely driven
professionally.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.597
But now I guess
I have other priorities.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.686
Besides, if I was out competing
for every job on the market

21:10.727 --> 21:12.813
I wouldn't have time
to make you my famous

21:12.854 --> 21:16.108
sizzling chorizo scrambler.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.193
Seriously, you want?

21:18.235 --> 21:20.487
- Fish frittata?
- You're mean.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.240
What? Hair of the dog,
that's a thing.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.410
- Oh, fried gizzard sandwich?
- Ugh!

21:26.451 --> 21:28.578
(George)
'Egg drop soup,
extra droppings.'

21:28.620 --> 21:30.455
'Yeah? One of those.'
