00:35.455 --> 00:36.888
Mom, when's Dad coming home?

00:37.013 --> 00:39.260
I can't make my sugar cube
Parthenon without him.

00:39.385 --> 00:42.166
- And I need a ride to store.
- Oh, that's important.

00:42.381 --> 00:45.940
Kids, as soon as your father gets home
he'll have time for you both.

00:52.241 --> 00:53.841
Well, look who's home.

00:54.123 --> 00:55.484
Carrying his shoes?

00:55.609 --> 00:58.231
Almost like he doesn't want
anyone to know he's home.

00:58.356 --> 01:01.268
Roger, please. I just want
20 minutes to myself, that's all.

01:01.489 --> 01:04.033
You know what a dog would do
at a time like this?

01:04.158 --> 01:05.343
He'd bark excitedly,

01:05.468 --> 01:07.650
alerting the family
that his master was home.

01:07.843 --> 01:08.953
Please, Roger, no.

01:09.078 --> 01:12.022
Of course, I suppose
if that dog were to get a treat...

01:12.147 --> 01:14.767
- What do you want? Anything.
- A carton of menthol lights,

01:14.892 --> 01:16.658
and I want look like Audrey Hepburn.

01:16.828 --> 01:18.318
I can give you all the cigarettes,

01:18.443 --> 01:20.635
but I can't make you look
like Audrey Hepburn.

01:24.323 --> 01:25.312
Dad's home!

01:25.437 --> 01:26.996
I haven't started the Parthenon.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.930
It's due tomorrow,
and I'm really tired.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.891
If we don't get
on the highway right now,

01:31.016 --> 01:32.975
the headband store
is going to be closed.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.179
Don't forget the menthol lights.

01:42.598 --> 01:44.156
I'm really mad at Dad right now.

01:44.281 --> 01:46.215
I woke up from my nap,
saw he wasn't as far

01:46.340 --> 01:49.149
along with the Parthenon
as he should be, and I told him so.

01:49.274 --> 01:51.518
Not now, Steven. I have a meeting
in, like, one minute.

01:51.643 --> 01:54.374
Pretend to be my assistant.
And, if this guy asks, my name is...

01:54.499 --> 01:55.899
Freddie Underwood,

01:56.138 --> 01:58.636
porn screenwriter extraordinaire!

01:58.869 --> 02:00.161
Helicopter Perry!

02:00.506 --> 02:03.314
The sleaziest porn producer
east of Van Nuys!

02:03.439 --> 02:05.746
Come here,
you son-of-a-bitch bastard!

02:05.871 --> 02:08.056
So, how's the smut business, H.P.?

02:08.181 --> 02:09.805
The Internet's killing me, Freddie.

02:09.930 --> 02:13.257
Every frat boy with a digital camera
thinks he's a filmmaker now.

02:13.459 --> 02:14.985
I've seen what you speak of.

02:15.110 --> 02:18.220
Dumpster Sluts and the like.
There's no art in it anymore.

02:18.602 --> 02:21.411
Freddie, I'm here
because you wrote <i>Wetness</i>,

02:21.536 --> 02:23.760
the greatest porn film I ever made.

02:23.906 --> 02:26.312
I need you to give me
that same magic again.

02:26.637 --> 02:29.949
I'm writing down a number.
I will not accept a penny less.

02:30.583 --> 02:32.144
A million dollars?

02:32.269 --> 02:35.789
Actually, if you look closely,
it says a million "doll hairs."

02:36.490 --> 02:38.866
- No, it doesn't.
- Oh. It was supposed to.

02:42.502 --> 02:45.310
You should get some sleep, Stan.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

02:45.435 --> 02:47.368
Right to bed.
No time to myself.

02:47.493 --> 02:49.968
Do you realize I've been trying
to read this book for 10 years,

02:50.093 --> 02:51.987
and I haven't gotten past
the first paragraph?

02:52.112 --> 02:53.562
Tonight, that ends.

02:54.169 --> 02:56.979
<i>"Captain First Rank Marko
Ramius of the Soviet Navy</i>

02:57.104 --> 02:59.288
<i>"was dressed for
the Arctic conditions normal</i>

02:59.413 --> 03:01.670
<i>"to the Northern Fleet
submarine base at Polyarny."</i>

03:01.795 --> 03:04.654
<i>Okay. One sentence down.
Already compelling.</i>

03:04.779 --> 03:07.924
<i>"Five layers of wool
and oilskin enclosed him."</i>

03:11.642 --> 03:12.642
You asleep?

03:15.530 --> 03:18.030
I've been holding
that in since Jeopardy.

03:21.691 --> 03:24.558
- What's all that, Dick?
- I'm watching every movie ever made,

03:24.683 --> 03:26.831
alphabetically by actor's last name.

03:27.305 --> 03:29.927
I'm on Martin Mull.
Underrated actor.

03:30.052 --> 03:33.235
Could anyone else have played
Colonel Mustard in <i>Clue</i> ?

03:33.360 --> 03:35.727
The answer is yes.
Christopher Lloyd.

03:35.852 --> 03:38.351
My point is, Mull gets work.

03:38.476 --> 03:39.626
Consistently.

03:40.096 --> 03:42.219
But you have a wife
and kids at home.

03:42.344 --> 03:45.260
How do you have the free time
to do... anything?

03:46.336 --> 03:48.647
The boys down at
the lab gave me these.

03:48.772 --> 03:52.273
You take a pill right before bed,
and you feel like you slept 8 hours.

03:52.514 --> 03:54.013
So you take these pills,

03:54.138 --> 03:56.318
and you never have to sleep?

03:57.020 --> 03:58.754
So I can spend days with my family,

03:58.879 --> 04:00.692
and the nights are all for me.

04:00.817 --> 04:03.059
What will the guys at the lab
think of next?

04:03.184 --> 04:04.931
They have tons of cool stuff.

04:05.056 --> 04:06.742
Check out my rocket zipper.

04:09.938 --> 04:12.224
Once again, we beat the Russians.

04:23.424 --> 04:24.524
I feel so...

04:25.318 --> 04:26.733
not wired, but...

04:26.901 --> 04:28.001
well-rested.

04:28.324 --> 04:30.830
Like I had a small coffee
around 6:30 at night.

04:30.955 --> 04:32.305
I'm feeling good.

04:33.887 --> 04:36.108
<i>This is the song
that I wrote at 3:00 a.m.</i>

04:36.569 --> 04:39.236
<i>I taught myself
how to play the guitar</i>

04:39.567 --> 04:42.239
<i>I only know two chords so far</i>

04:42.407 --> 04:45.119
<i>My fingers hurt 'cause
I haven't grown calluses</i>

04:45.244 --> 04:47.852
<i>I wonder how long it takes
To grow calluses</i>

04:48.122 --> 04:50.611
<i>I'll bet that'ssomething
You could learn on the Internet</i>

04:50.736 --> 04:53.542
<i>Tomorrow night, I'm going to learn
To use the Internet.</i>

04:57.486 --> 05:00.219
I'm so glad you're having fun
spending time with the kids.

05:00.344 --> 05:01.884
I'm a dad.
That's my job.

05:02.215 --> 05:04.775
Maybe we can spend
some time together later.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.200
Just you and me?

05:06.336 --> 05:08.323
I don't know, Francine.
I work all day,

05:08.448 --> 05:10.916
I spend time with the kids,
and I gotta sleep.

05:11.041 --> 05:13.450
- There's only so many hours in the day.
- I guess you're right.

05:13.575 --> 05:15.225
I'm just being selfish.

05:15.507 --> 05:16.523
Just a little.

05:19.299 --> 05:21.946
Dick, these pills saved my life.
I can't thank you enough.

05:22.185 --> 05:25.350
My pleasure. Make sure you never mention
the pills to your family.

05:25.475 --> 05:27.986
- They'll definitely want in.
- Oh, no way.

05:28.111 --> 05:30.482
This time is like a gift
from the heavens.

05:30.607 --> 05:34.333
The last thing I want to do is waste it
with my kids or, God forbid, Francine.

05:35.351 --> 05:38.345
Hey, Dick, do those pills
make you hallucinate your wife?

05:38.470 --> 05:41.716
Damn! Do they let you go back
in time and change the past?

05:41.841 --> 05:43.688
Damn! Do they make you fly?

05:44.212 --> 05:45.584
Really? But only once?

05:45.709 --> 05:48.828
All right. I'll save it for Halloween.
I'm going as a turkey.

05:48.953 --> 05:50.803
Yes, they do. Yes, they do.

05:51.109 --> 05:52.259
Yes, they do!

05:52.512 --> 05:54.321
I'm going to have
to change my costume.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.506
Bad news about Halloween, Francine.

05:59.312 --> 06:02.933
You've been taking pills every night
so you don't have to sleep?

06:03.058 --> 06:06.362
- How long has this been going on?
- I don't know. Six, seven weeks.

06:06.487 --> 06:08.826
Hard to tell.
It's all been like one long day to me!

06:09.010 --> 06:11.605
What are you doing at night
that's making you so happy?

06:11.730 --> 06:12.727
Tons of stuff!

06:12.852 --> 06:14.957
Like this flip-book.
Over 30 drawings.

06:15.910 --> 06:18.845
That's you... falling.
And then hitting the ground.

06:18.970 --> 06:20.706
And then your parachute opens.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.711
In the next book, you become bionic.

06:22.836 --> 06:26.394
This is what you're doing
instead of spending time with your wife.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.139
We can't spend this time
together anyway because you're asleep.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.947
- Not if I take those pills, too.
- What?

06:33.322 --> 06:36.455
Then we can both be awake,
and spend time together!

06:37.400 --> 06:39.252
We can watch Ken Burns'Jazz!

06:39.436 --> 06:41.182
No. And let me tell you why.

06:43.472 --> 06:46.673
You see, there's "Stan" time
and there's "family" time.

06:46.798 --> 06:48.157
You are part of the family.

06:48.470 --> 06:50.792
I do this, I do this.
Now it's a pizza.

06:50.917 --> 06:52.119
That you can have.

06:54.264 --> 06:57.156
Fine. Then I'll take the pills
and do my own stuff.

06:57.281 --> 06:59.281
I'll leave you alone, I promise.

07:00.215 --> 07:02.379
Okay.
I'll give you the pills.

07:02.587 --> 07:05.411
But, after 11:00 p.m.,
we go our separate ways.

07:06.267 --> 07:07.953
Can we sometimes meet for a snack?

07:08.078 --> 07:10.840
I enjoy a solitary
BBQ Lean Pocket at dawn.

07:11.011 --> 07:13.773
It's become a ritual.
Your presence would disrupt that.

07:18.490 --> 07:21.180
- I think he likes it.
- This is terrible!

07:21.305 --> 07:22.617
It's completely dated!

07:22.742 --> 07:26.048
Pool boys and pizza guys
nailing lonely housewives?!

07:26.173 --> 07:28.296
Maybe I need to find
somebody else, Freddie.

07:28.421 --> 07:30.104
Maybe you don't know sex anymore.

07:30.229 --> 07:32.431
I assure you there
are two things I know:

07:32.556 --> 07:34.570
how to poison an Asian and sex.

07:34.695 --> 07:36.298
What if you change the pool boy

07:36.423 --> 07:39.500
to an I.T. guy who makes
his appointments on his PDA?

07:40.022 --> 07:42.482
Sorry about my girl, H.P.
She's on her period.

07:42.607 --> 07:43.607
I love it!

07:43.912 --> 07:47.348
It's now, it's modern.
It's exactly what this script needs.

07:47.473 --> 07:49.846
Freddie, I want you
to write with this kid.

07:51.281 --> 07:53.181
- No way.
- Hey! It's settled.

07:53.501 --> 07:56.022
You're a team.
Let me tell you something, Freddie.

07:56.147 --> 07:58.206
Collaboration is an important thing,

07:58.331 --> 08:01.055
not just in writing, but in life.

08:01.454 --> 08:02.454
Remember,

08:02.828 --> 08:05.007
behind every blade of grass

08:05.132 --> 08:06.432
there is a voice

08:06.568 --> 08:08.018
whispering, "Grow."

08:09.564 --> 08:11.561
How high are you right now, H.P.?

08:11.686 --> 08:12.836
I'm up there.

08:15.138 --> 08:18.209
Whatcha doin',
Mr. Awake-at-3:00-a.m.?

08:18.334 --> 08:19.673
Playing Beetman.

08:19.798 --> 08:21.544
You're a tough, no-nonsense beet

08:21.669 --> 08:24.219
trying to survive
Farmer Gary's Evil Garden.

08:24.964 --> 08:26.516
'Cause I was thinking,

08:26.753 --> 08:30.752
maybe my Francine time
could visit your Stan time,

08:31.070 --> 08:34.263
and, together, they'd have
a little Stan/Fran...

08:35.075 --> 08:37.308
Klaus, I've got no interests.

08:37.644 --> 08:40.640
I thought I liked reading, but then,
when I rembered what that was,

08:40.765 --> 08:42.760
I realized, oh, God, no!
I hate that.

08:42.885 --> 08:45.833
Francine, I'm right in the middle
of a "green bag" demonstration.

08:46.196 --> 08:49.126
Those beautiful strawberries
are four months old!

08:49.251 --> 08:50.731
Oh, sorry, Klaus.

08:50.856 --> 08:52.745
You go ahead and watch your show.

08:52.870 --> 08:54.370
I'll just watch you.

08:54.865 --> 08:57.218
Hey, that's something
I've always liked doing!

08:57.343 --> 08:58.888
Watching you swim.

08:59.234 --> 09:03.234
And I did love going to the aquarium
with my dad when I was a girl.

09:03.540 --> 09:05.919
Maybe one of my interests
is remembering.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.755
Maybe your interest is fish.

09:09.580 --> 09:13.570
And, Klaus, you are a fish!
This is something we could do together.

09:13.836 --> 09:16.807
Francine, I enjoy a solitary
corn dog at 3:00 a.m.

09:16.932 --> 09:18.455
Your presence would disrupt that.

09:18.580 --> 09:22.137
That's it! I'm going to study fish
who aren't complete!

10:05.589 --> 10:07.751
Ocean Digest?
What the hell is this?

10:07.876 --> 10:08.985
Oh, it came!

10:09.435 --> 10:10.817
I've been published.

10:11.120 --> 10:14.678
"How Modern Geophysical Currents
have Affected the Migration Patterns

10:14.803 --> 10:18.108
"of the Elusive and Highly
Sought-After Colossal Squid".

10:18.284 --> 10:19.633
By Francine Smith.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.852
Is that the title of the article?

10:21.977 --> 10:23.038
'Cause it's long.

10:23.226 --> 10:24.723
Stan, don't you get it?

10:24.848 --> 10:27.297
I think I found the Colossal Squid.

10:27.531 --> 10:30.837
All the world's oceanographers
have been looking for this squid,

10:30.962 --> 10:33.959
and I figured out that they were looking
in the wrong ocean.

10:34.084 --> 10:36.568
This is how you choose
to spend your extra time?

10:36.704 --> 10:41.056
- How have you been spending yours?
- By completing the Beetman video game.

10:41.396 --> 10:45.396
I earned an invitation to the Beetman
Regional Championships in Washington.

10:46.192 --> 10:50.022
This is a confirmation that they
received your $300 entrance fee.

10:50.431 --> 10:52.117
Regionals!

10:52.242 --> 10:53.711
Stan, I just rembered.

10:53.836 --> 10:55.612
I have to take a call
with the head of the

10:55.737 --> 10:58.042
French Institute for
Nautical Exploration.

10:58.167 --> 11:01.076
But it's daytime.
You're talking about nighttime stuff.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.430
Sorry. This is the only
time they could do it.

11:03.555 --> 11:05.596
Well, that...
that works out great.

11:05.721 --> 11:08.078
'Cause I need to start playing Beetman
during the day.

11:08.203 --> 11:11.750
Gotta be able to work it with the glare
because that's going to be thrown at me.

11:11.875 --> 11:14.333
You don't even know, Francine.
You don't even know.

11:17.637 --> 11:19.636
This is even worse
than the first draft!

11:19.761 --> 11:23.761
- You said you wanted it more modern.
- Yeah, modern as in now, today.

11:24.252 --> 11:26.998
This is set in the year 3020
on the planet Labia.

11:27.123 --> 11:28.823
It's pronounced Lay-bea.

11:28.994 --> 11:30.867
And it's not a planet, it's a moon.

11:30.992 --> 11:32.441
None of this is real!

11:32.614 --> 11:35.777
What about when the orgy rocket
refuels on the space station?

11:36.017 --> 11:38.447
There was no sex for 62 pages!

11:38.675 --> 11:41.731
Well, no one's gonna be invested
in a month-long intergalactic orgy

11:41.856 --> 11:44.164
if the ship's got
insufficient fuel cells.

11:44.289 --> 11:46.663
You want to talk reality,
let's talk reality!

11:47.096 --> 11:48.584
Let me be clear:

11:49.093 --> 11:53.093
I want something that could
actually happen today in real life.

11:53.649 --> 11:56.384
You got one last chance
or you're fired.

11:58.455 --> 11:59.766
Okay, we gotta brainstorm.

12:00.663 --> 12:02.113
Boy meets girl.

12:02.511 --> 12:04.470
Boing meets girl.

12:04.818 --> 12:07.253
Boing eats... Pass!

12:07.378 --> 12:09.353
Go to the next one.
Wait, what are we doing?

12:12.993 --> 12:14.366
Stan, you're home.

12:14.705 --> 12:16.800
I'd like you to meet
Philippe Monday,

12:16.925 --> 12:19.609
famed French oceanographer
from France.

12:19.734 --> 12:21.355
Mr. Francine!

12:21.534 --> 12:24.428
It is a pleasure to meet
zee husband of Francine.

12:24.601 --> 12:27.659
Philippe read my article
in <i>Ocean Digest</i> magazine

12:27.784 --> 12:29.467
and wants to take me
on an expedition

12:29.592 --> 12:32.334
to Antarctica to find
the Colossal Squid!

12:32.587 --> 12:34.502
Expedition?
For how long?

12:34.672 --> 12:35.903
Only three months.

12:36.028 --> 12:37.578
Although, if we find zee squid,

12:37.703 --> 12:40.139
we will take Francine
on a worldwide lecture tour.

12:40.264 --> 12:43.382
<i>Tu vas etre celebre!</i>

12:43.507 --> 12:45.190
<i>Philippe, tu sais que</i>

12:45.315 --> 12:47.556
<i>ce n'est que la science
qui m'interesse.</i>

12:47.750 --> 12:49.226
You speak French now, too?

12:49.436 --> 12:50.560
<i>Un petit peu.</i>

12:50.932 --> 12:53.243
Philippe, I have
to show you my maps.

12:53.368 --> 12:54.968
I will love your maps!

12:55.864 --> 12:58.068
Mr. Francine, I know
this is upsetting,

12:58.237 --> 13:01.061
but understand that I am
a homosexual, yes?

13:01.354 --> 13:03.278
You understand homosexual.

13:04.723 --> 13:06.830
So you will be losing
your wife not physically,

13:06.955 --> 13:08.857
but perhaps emotionally.

13:14.021 --> 13:16.250
That guy is a douche, yes?

13:16.572 --> 13:18.304
You understand douche?

13:22.920 --> 13:26.101
You can't leave your family for months
just to look for some big squid.

13:26.226 --> 13:28.223
It's a Colossal Squid.

13:28.348 --> 13:30.472
It's the largest
cephalopod on Earth.

13:30.597 --> 13:33.279
And I spoke to the kids.
They support me.

13:33.404 --> 13:35.775
Of course they support you,
they're motherless idiots!

13:35.900 --> 13:38.210
Francine, you'll miss
the Beetman competition.

13:38.335 --> 13:40.453
You'll do fine without me, Stan.

13:40.578 --> 13:43.887
You know, in a way, this is
exactly what you wanted.

13:44.012 --> 13:46.597
It's "Stan" time all the time.

13:48.692 --> 13:49.692
Fine, good!

13:49.878 --> 13:51.437
Now I don't have any distractions!

13:51.562 --> 13:54.744
Just 24 hours of uninterrupted
Beetman action!

13:54.869 --> 13:57.085
Just gonna beet it
till my hands fall off!

14:00.298 --> 14:01.734
We can write a porno, right?

14:01.859 --> 14:04.192
We can totally do this.
H.P.'s a dunce.

14:04.317 --> 14:06.163
Sure he has a good eye
for casting black men,

14:06.288 --> 14:08.410
but what does he know
about story? Bupkis!

14:08.535 --> 14:11.342
Okay, porn scenario...
Think, Steve, think.

14:11.467 --> 14:13.277
It's not just gonna fall
into our laps.

14:13.402 --> 14:15.561
- How's it going, guys?
- Where's my sandwich?

14:15.686 --> 14:16.774
Coming right up.

14:16.899 --> 14:19.330
I just wanted to introduce you
to my friend Sandy.

14:19.455 --> 14:22.389
She's new here,
completely inexperienced,

14:22.514 --> 14:23.635
but eager to learn.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.546
You might say I'm a virgin at this.

14:28.065 --> 14:30.625
I didn't order your life story.
I ordered a tuna melt.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.183
Why's it so hot in here?

14:32.308 --> 14:35.250
Oh, my God, we're so sorry, guys.
The air conditioning broke.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.991
We'll fix it right away.

14:37.116 --> 14:39.628
If there's anything else you need,
anything,just call us.

14:41.731 --> 14:44.601
- And I mean anything.
- What's wrong with you?

14:44.726 --> 14:47.730
You get a dollar every time
you say the word "anything"?

14:54.302 --> 14:56.334
I got it!
Steve, start typing!

14:56.459 --> 14:58.330
Exterior, Costa Mesa,

14:58.455 --> 14:59.455
day...

15:01.723 --> 15:03.550
Need a hand with that?

15:03.758 --> 15:06.504
Who are you?
My husband's away on business.

15:06.629 --> 15:09.376
I'm the pool boy/pizza guy.

15:09.501 --> 15:12.371
I'm here to check your pH balance

15:12.558 --> 15:15.302
and deliver the sausage you ordered.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.802
What the hell?!

15:19.733 --> 15:21.543
That's the crap H.P. hated.

15:21.668 --> 15:24.413
- It's not modern or real.
- Were you even listening?

15:24.538 --> 15:26.951
I was the pool boy
and the pizza guy.

15:27.347 --> 15:30.092
If demonstrating that
the working poor need two jobs

15:30.217 --> 15:32.215
just to make ends meet
isn't modern or real,

15:32.340 --> 15:34.391
then I don't know what the hell is!

15:41.209 --> 15:42.607
So many soil coins!

15:43.071 --> 15:45.713
- Dad, you gotta eat.
- I have Pirate Booty.

15:47.179 --> 15:48.999
I gotta practice.
Championship's tonight.

15:49.124 --> 15:51.764
I got another e-mail from Mom.
Expedition's going well.

15:51.889 --> 15:53.921
- She said...
- Did she say there's a nuclear rabbit

15:54.046 --> 15:56.207
on her expedition,
because I just froze 4.

15:56.738 --> 15:57.922
Just thawed out!

15:58.549 --> 15:59.649
Oh, got 'em!

16:01.127 --> 16:03.503
{\EASTERN REGIONAL
BEETMAN CHAMPIONSHIPS}

16:04.475 --> 16:05.784
You're going down, Trung.

16:05.909 --> 16:07.881
You forgot to aerate your soil!

16:15.709 --> 16:17.578
Trung, you've got two options:

16:17.703 --> 16:19.449
You can hang your head in shame

16:19.574 --> 16:23.064
or you can shake my hand
and buy me a slice like a man.

16:25.124 --> 16:26.124
Coward.

16:27.464 --> 16:30.196
And the winner of the Eastern
Regional Beetman Tournament:

16:30.372 --> 16:31.372
Stan Smith!

16:31.796 --> 16:33.178
Benny, hurry up!

16:33.303 --> 16:35.551
We have to pick your brother up
at karate!

16:35.676 --> 16:37.298
Okay, Mom!

16:37.423 --> 16:39.973
- I hate her!
- Geez, take it easy, kid.

16:44.668 --> 16:46.847
See, that's why you lost, Trung:
your lady.

16:46.972 --> 16:49.833
You didn't train enough because you were
spending too much time with her,

16:49.958 --> 16:52.126
having dinner, watching TV,

16:53.645 --> 16:56.490
picking out her shoes
for a cocktail party.

17:08.934 --> 17:10.996
What is it?
What is it?

17:11.742 --> 17:13.627
Don't stop.
A little more.

17:14.586 --> 17:15.736
Almost there!

17:17.421 --> 17:18.857
Right in my face.

17:18.982 --> 17:21.665
Great, now it's gonna
be freezing in here.

17:23.386 --> 17:25.907
Steve, come on. We're going
to the diner to write porn.

17:26.032 --> 17:28.214
I was just getting my sweater
in case it gets chilly.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.340
A sweater?!

17:29.465 --> 17:31.000
What are you, an old lady?

17:36.454 --> 17:39.813
Better to have it and not need it
than to need it and not have it.

17:41.134 --> 17:43.218
Oh, my God, I'm gonna get you!

17:46.124 --> 17:48.434
- I can't believe you!
- Yeah, how's that taste?

17:48.559 --> 17:49.972
That taste good!

17:51.799 --> 17:53.758
It's so obvious!

17:54.104 --> 17:56.252
Interior: Chimdale Spa.

17:58.821 --> 18:01.685
I shouldn't have had
that second glass of champagne.

18:02.162 --> 18:04.097
I'm feeling vulnerable.

18:04.222 --> 18:07.806
Good, 'cause I've been dying
to kiss you all night.

18:16.382 --> 18:20.133
You gotta to be kidding me!
H.P. said no more sci-fi stuff!

18:20.258 --> 18:25.216
When will you people realize
that robots are erotic?

18:25.686 --> 18:28.245
I don't know. Maybe this business
has changed too much.

18:28.370 --> 18:31.366
Did you know I read that they bleach
buttholes now, Steven?

18:31.491 --> 18:34.039
Are they trying to say
God chose the wrong color?

18:35.502 --> 18:37.449
Maybe we don't know
anything about sex.

18:37.618 --> 18:40.590
Maybe we should just stick
to writing something we do know.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.347
A light romantic comedy...

18:43.472 --> 18:45.957
Set in turn-of-the- century England!

18:46.093 --> 18:47.459
"Exterior, Manor House.

18:47.864 --> 18:50.272
"As the pizza delivery man
emerges from his carriage

18:50.397 --> 18:53.592
"and rings the doorbell.
The robot butler answers the door."

18:53.717 --> 18:56.755
Love it! Still waiting on
that tuna melt, sweetheart!

18:57.132 --> 18:59.997
My memory chip does not
register ordering a pizza.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.880
Prank sensor activated.

19:02.005 --> 19:04.677
That's dialogue!
You just pitched dialogue!

19:07.699 --> 19:09.230
Francine, what do you see?

19:10.258 --> 19:13.215
I see coral, some plant life,

19:13.612 --> 19:15.685
but I don't see the Colossal Squid.

19:16.063 --> 19:17.071
Wait a second.

19:21.478 --> 19:23.620
The Colossal Squid.

19:33.765 --> 19:36.278
Stan, don't turn around.
Just swim away.

19:42.565 --> 19:45.760
Stan, you just killed
the Colossal Squid!

19:45.933 --> 19:47.867
<i>No, I don't think so.
That one was tiny.</i>

19:47.992 --> 19:50.799
<i>I passed, like, five others on the way
over here that were way bigger.</i>

19:50.924 --> 19:53.817
- <i>If anything, I killed a baby.</i>
- What are you doing here?

19:54.047 --> 19:56.395
<i>I came to tell you that I was wrong.</i>

19:56.668 --> 19:58.974
<i>I know I said I wanted time alone,</i>

19:59.099 --> 20:01.658
<i>but now I realize
I just want time with you.</i>

20:01.909 --> 20:03.409
Things have changed, Stan.

20:03.654 --> 20:06.838
<i>They don't have to!
I threw away the pills, Francine.</i>

20:06.963 --> 20:08.539
<i>I want to go back to our old life,</i>

20:08.834 --> 20:12.335
<i>being with you during the day
and sleeping with you at night.</i>

20:16.760 --> 20:17.797
There you are.

20:17.922 --> 20:20.190
You switched channels on me,
you absurd madame.

20:20.315 --> 20:22.165
So, did you find zee squid?

20:22.721 --> 20:26.093
Remember, when you do find it,
we will tour zee world.

20:26.357 --> 20:28.655
Your life will change forever.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.921
I'm sorry, Philippe.

20:35.230 --> 20:36.930
I didn't find the squid.

20:37.501 --> 20:38.444
I was wrong.

20:42.369 --> 20:43.718
Fabien, my brother,

20:43.843 --> 20:47.210
we have wasted the money from the sale
of your bicycle company.

20:47.335 --> 20:48.585
You are ruined.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.209
Life, ah?

20:54.762 --> 20:57.112
Honey, turn your CB to channel nine.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.046
It's just the baby.

21:07.171 --> 21:08.958
It's the already-dead baby.
