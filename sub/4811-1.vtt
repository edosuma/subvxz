<i>Moving to new frequency. Solar interference. </i>

03:17.647 --> 03:23.176
<i>Incoming transport detected.
Docking procedures engaged. </i>

03:23.253 --> 03:27.986
<i>Thermal sensors detect
humanoids, level 36.</i>

03:39.936 --> 03:44.964
<i>Humanoids advancing,

05:05.989 --> 05:08.651
<i> Long wait, demon,</i>

05:08.725 --> 05:10.818
<i>for such a short game. </i>

05:15.532 --> 05:18.660
<i>Now curiosity is satisfied. </i>

05:20.136 --> 05:22.366
<i>And it's time... </i>

05:22.439 --> 05:24.999
<i>for revenge. </i>

05:29.379 --> 05:33.782
<i>Dr. Merchant,
consider yourself relieved. </i>

05:33.850 --> 05:37.581
<i> What else, Chamberlain?</i>

05:37.654 --> 05:41.249
He's rerouted all available power
to his personal quarters...

05:41.324 --> 05:44.953
and he's shut down
most of the ship.

05:45.028 --> 05:47.588
I want you to check everything out
and find out why.

05:47.664 --> 05:49.598
Yes, sir.

05:49.666 --> 05:53.830
So, we have the company's
most productive space station...

05:53.904 --> 05:57.101
hijacked and taken out of orbit
by the man who built it.

05:57.173 --> 06:00.267
We have the man himself
immersed in ancient history,

06:00.343 --> 06:03.107
<i>letting the whole place
go to shit. </i>

06:03.179 --> 06:05.977
<i>- Evaluation?
- Wacko.</i>

06:06.049 --> 06:08.609
<i>I wasn't asking you, Carducci.
I was asking the expert. </i>

06:09.686 --> 06:12.621
<i>Well, Rimmer?</i>

06:12.689 --> 06:16.125
Great man didn't live up
to your expectations, did he?

06:16.192 --> 06:20.959
I'm sure he will, sir, as soon as I
can begin my interrogation.

06:24.401 --> 06:26.699
Where's your crew?

06:26.770 --> 06:31.469
<i>I made them leave. They're headed for
Earth. Look, time is of the essence. </i>

06:31.541 --> 06:34.669
Was there some
technical problem?

06:34.744 --> 06:36.939
No. Yes.
Yes, that's it.

06:37.013 --> 06:39.174
There's been a technical
problem, and you...

06:39.249 --> 06:42.412
all of you have to get the fuck
off this station right now.

06:43.920 --> 06:47.014
- When we go, you come with us.
- No, you don't understand.

06:47.090 --> 06:49.081
Help me, then.

06:50.694 --> 06:52.753
What's your name?

06:52.829 --> 06:54.888
Rimmer.

06:54.965 --> 06:57.126
I'm playing the endgame
here, Rimmer,

06:57.200 --> 06:59.361
finishing something
that began centuries ago,

06:59.436 --> 07:02.200
and I don't have the time
to help you understand.

07:02.272 --> 07:05.605
<i>You don't know
what you're playing with. </i>

07:05.675 --> 07:08.041
What are you afraid of?

07:08.111 --> 07:10.807
Whatever it is,
it's here...

07:10.880 --> 07:13.110
in this station.

07:13.183 --> 07:17.882
That and things your little
rational mind couldn't even dream of.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.988
But I dream.

07:22.058 --> 07:24.720
Oh, I dream.

07:24.794 --> 07:27.820
<i>Parker was right.
You are crazy. </i>

07:27.897 --> 07:29.865
<i>I built this place
for a reason:</i>

07:29.933 --> 07:33.061
To create the biggest trap
in the galaxy.

07:33.136 --> 07:36.628
<i>- What did you expect to catch?
- Hell is what I'm going to catch.</i>

07:36.706 --> 07:39.470
And I'm going to burn it away
in a blaze of light.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.908
You're serious,
aren't you?

07:43.246 --> 07:46.682
If I tell you
the whole story,

07:46.750 --> 07:49.344
<i>will you let me finish
what I began?</i>

07:51.521 --> 07:56.788
<i>Centuries ago,
a man, an ancestor of mine,</i>

07:56.860 --> 07:59.021
Phillip L'Merchant,

07:59.095 --> 08:02.553
<i>built a puzzle box,
the first box,</i>

08:02.632 --> 08:04.566
<i>his finest work. </i>

08:06.036 --> 08:09.301
<i>Commissioned by a wealthy
aristocrat named De L 'Isle,</i>

08:09.372 --> 08:11.863
<i>a man obsessed
with black magic,</i>

08:11.941 --> 08:14.239
<i>a leader of the occult. </i>

08:14.310 --> 08:17.040
<i>Phillip was so proud
of his work,</i>

08:17.113 --> 08:19.877
<i>a work that would
establish his name,</i>

08:19.949 --> 08:23.749
<i>his family... my family. </i>

08:23.820 --> 08:27.347
<i>He didn't know the great power
the box held... </i>

08:27.424 --> 08:30.655
<i>and the unspeakable things
it would release...</i>

08:30.727 --> 08:32.751
<i>the evil,</i>

08:32.828 --> 08:35.592
<i>the sins,</i>

08:35.664 --> 08:37.599
<i>the pain. </i>

08:41.371 --> 08:44.932
- Is it done?
- Done.

08:45.008 --> 08:48.307
<i>- Is it wonderful?
- Wonderful.</i>

08:48.378 --> 08:50.346
Are you brilliant?

08:51.881 --> 08:54.714
The finest toy maker in France.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.446
Oh, what does it do?

09:20.210 --> 09:25.238
<i>Oh. It doesn't
actually do anything. </i>

09:26.316 --> 09:28.511
It's my masterpiece.

09:28.585 --> 09:31.213
You simply
couldn't understand.

09:31.287 --> 09:35.121
I was working to a commission
to a very specific request.

09:35.191 --> 09:37.489
<i>It's almost midnight.
Where are you going?</i>

09:37.560 --> 09:42.327
- The Chateau De L'Isle, to deliver the box.
- Now? Why?

09:42.398 --> 09:45.094
Because my work might be
appreciated there.

09:50.073 --> 09:53.270
It's late.
Stay with me.

09:54.644 --> 09:56.908
Stay with us.

10:01.050 --> 10:03.484
I must go.

10:03.553 --> 10:06.613
My son will be born
in a better place than this.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.919
This is only the beginning.

10:08.992 --> 10:10.926
I can feel it.

10:40.690 --> 10:45.059
All alone in this
dark, dark world.

10:45.128 --> 10:48.723
<i>No home, no family. </i>

10:49.966 --> 10:53.163
Not even christened,
I understand.

10:55.138 --> 10:57.902
<i> Jacques,</i>

10:57.974 --> 11:00.465
<i>show this child
to a chair. </i>

11:07.183 --> 11:09.447
Enjoy.

11:19.229 --> 11:21.697
Careful!

11:21.764 --> 11:26.167
I'd be mortified if you
sliced your little finger.

11:28.304 --> 11:30.272
Such a gentleman.

11:30.340 --> 11:34.174
<i>Are you always
such a gentleman?</i>

11:34.244 --> 11:36.610
No.

11:36.679 --> 11:38.613
Not always.

11:43.519 --> 11:47.956
<i>Monsieur De L 'Isle is
France's greatest magician. </i>

12:05.775 --> 12:09.438
- What is this?
- So you don't bruise.

12:38.508 --> 12:41.102
<i>Easy, Jacques.
Keep the pressure steady. </i>

12:47.250 --> 12:49.241
She has spirit.
Splendid.

12:57.894 --> 13:00.761
Now we can begin.

13:27.323 --> 13:29.917
Ahh, L'Merchant.

13:29.993 --> 13:32.587
As precise as your pieces.

13:32.662 --> 13:35.961
As timely as your toys.

13:36.032 --> 13:38.865
<i>And where is the box?</i>

13:40.003 --> 13:42.801
<i>Pay him, Jacques. </i>

13:42.872 --> 13:46.942
Thank you.

13:47.010 --> 13:50.275
<i>Good night, toy maker. </i>

14:07.063 --> 14:09.827
Take her in
to the laboratory.

14:13.503 --> 14:15.437
<i>Find the right instrument. </i>

14:15.505 --> 14:19.168
<i>We must make a clean...
incision... </i>

14:27.216 --> 14:30.583
<i>so that we can
remove the innards... </i>

14:32.088 --> 14:35.251
<i>so we can replace
the flesh again. </i>

14:35.925 --> 14:39.019
<i>Yes, the gizzard. </i>

14:41.531 --> 14:43.465
We'll scrub this.

14:56.379 --> 15:01.248
<i>Now we can raise her up
off the ground. </i>

15:01.317 --> 15:03.182
<i>That's it. </i>

17:28.764 --> 17:33.326
<i>Walk now amongst us!</i>

17:49.051 --> 17:51.383
<i>-  My God.
- Fear not, Jacques. </i>

17:51.454 --> 17:54.287
Remember your lessons.

17:54.357 --> 17:58.817
A summoned demon
is yours to command.

17:58.894 --> 18:01.590
<i>Unless you stand
in hell's way. </i>

18:02.832 --> 18:05.096
Yes.

18:08.804 --> 18:12.570
He who summons the magic...

18:12.642 --> 18:15.475
<i>commands the magic. </i>

18:19.382 --> 18:22.010
<i>You are... </i>

18:22.084 --> 18:24.018
<i>Angelique. </i>

18:26.422 --> 18:29.118
<i>He who summons the magic...</i>

18:29.191 --> 18:32.422
Commands the magic.

18:36.632 --> 18:39.829
<i> 'Tis no story, Auguste. </i>

18:39.902 --> 18:43.736
<i>I saw what I saw,
heard what I heard. </i>

18:43.806 --> 18:46.172
<i>The box opens
the doors to hell. </i>

18:46.242 --> 18:50.770
This is the 18th century,
Phillip, not the dark ages.

18:50.846 --> 18:53.144
<i>The world is ruled
by reason. </i>

18:53.215 --> 18:55.911
We even got rid of God.

18:55.985 --> 18:59.512
And if there is no heaven,
then it follows reasonably...

18:59.588 --> 19:01.453
that there is no hell.

19:01.524 --> 19:04.755
I was at its very window
last night!

19:04.827 --> 19:09.389
Very well.
Suppose, for the sake of argument,

19:09.465 --> 19:13.231
<i>that what you fear happened
has happened. </i>

19:13.302 --> 19:17.636
A box that can open the gates of hell
must be able to close them.

19:17.707 --> 19:20.676
The box belongs to people with
little interest in closing such doors.

19:20.743 --> 19:24.975
Well, then the solution
lies literally in your hands.

19:25.047 --> 19:29.313
You've designed a machine
that you fear can bring forth demons.

19:29.385 --> 19:33.219
- Yes.
- Then design a machine that can destroy them.

19:42.865 --> 19:44.799
<i>Phillip had the design. </i>

19:44.867 --> 19:49.497
<i>That design.
It seemed an impossible task. </i>

19:49.572 --> 19:52.666
But he had to try,
try something.

19:52.742 --> 19:56.178
And his only hope
was to steal the box,

19:56.245 --> 20:00.682
the puzzle box that he had created
with his own hands.

20:11.594 --> 20:13.960
<i> Unbutton my shirt.
Yes. </i>

20:17.633 --> 20:19.567
<i>Turn around. </i>

20:24.173 --> 20:26.107
<i>Oh, yes. </i>

21:59.301 --> 22:03.829
<i>Toy maker, you have
such pliant fingers. </i>

22:05.241 --> 22:07.903
<i>I want them
to play with me. </i>

22:09.245 --> 22:11.805
And take my soul?

22:16.552 --> 22:20.682
It's already gone, toy maker.

22:20.756 --> 22:24.157
<i>Demons will walk the Earth,</i>

22:24.226 --> 22:26.820
and you're responsible.

22:26.896 --> 22:29.262
Think of that.

22:29.331 --> 22:34.792
You and your bloodline cursed 'til the end
of time because of your little puzzle box.

22:34.870 --> 22:39.102
What are you waiting for? Kill him
and come back where you belong.

22:53.022 --> 22:55.889
Such pliant fingers.

23:27.790 --> 23:31.419
My God!

23:31.493 --> 23:34.951
Please forgive me.

23:35.030 --> 23:37.294
I didn't know
what I was doing.

23:37.366 --> 23:40.028
We've got to
get you out of here.

23:40.102 --> 23:42.730
It's too late.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.669
<i>They're back. Save yourself. </i>

23:47.743 --> 23:51.201
Save the child.

24:01.490 --> 24:03.424
Jacques was right.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.825
Demons did walk the Earth,

24:07.896 --> 24:10.524
the same way they're walking
this station right now.

24:10.599 --> 24:13.432
From a puzzle box?

24:13.502 --> 24:16.266
Angelique had many boxes
made from his design,

24:16.338 --> 24:18.670
<i>but it wasn't enough. </i>

24:18.741 --> 24:21.574
<i>She wanted a box that
would open the gateway forever. </i>

24:21.644 --> 24:24.636
<i>- And your family?
- Was the key. </i>

24:24.713 --> 24:27.511
But they treated it
the same way you treat it.

24:27.583 --> 24:31.019
Like a fairy tale.
But their blood remembered.

24:32.421 --> 24:35.049
<i>And as the generations
passed,</i>

24:35.124 --> 24:37.991
there were Merchants
who dreamed of puzzle boxes...

24:38.060 --> 24:40.358
and doors leading to hell.

24:41.497 --> 24:44.694
And then one of them
met... Angelique...

24:45.801 --> 24:48.201
much, much later.

24:50.005 --> 24:52.974
Even in sleep,
you want me.

24:53.042 --> 24:55.510
Even in dreams,
you watch me.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.107
Yes, I know.

24:59.181 --> 25:01.479
I know what's
in your heart.

25:09.692 --> 25:12.786
John Merchant.

25:12.861 --> 25:15.989
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

25:16.065 --> 25:18.329
Are you okay?

25:18.400 --> 25:21.494
Oh, God, I woke Jack again.

25:21.570 --> 25:26.667
<i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>

25:31.080 --> 25:33.014
You look terrible.

25:35.417 --> 25:37.942
I'm worried, and I really think
you should see someone.

25:38.020 --> 25:40.488
You know I've been
having these dreams all my life.

25:40.556 --> 25:43.684
John, honey,
they're getting worse.

25:43.759 --> 25:47.752
It is your goddamned grandmother.
She was weird, John.

25:47.830 --> 25:52.665
You remember those stories about how, how
important you are and how important the family is?

25:52.735 --> 25:55.533
Honey, she put stuff
in your mind.

25:55.604 --> 25:58.664
Not all of it.
There are other things.

25:58.741 --> 26:01.642
Things that feel
like memories,

26:01.710 --> 26:04.110
impossible memories.

26:04.179 --> 26:08.172
And they just don't haunt my dreams,
they haunt my work.

26:08.250 --> 26:12.016
<i>- Everything that I've done...
- I don't want you haunted, and I don't want you hurt.</i>

26:12.087 --> 26:14.885
It's not that.
It's... It's stress.

26:14.957 --> 26:18.654
<i>It's this this banquet thing.
I hate crap like this!</i>

26:18.727 --> 26:21.161
Oh.
Then you shouldn't be so good.

26:21.230 --> 26:26.031
<i>- But it's not ready. I'm not sure if it will work.
- Right.</i>

26:26.101 --> 26:28.831
<i>So that's why your face
is on this magazine cover. </i>

26:36.145 --> 26:38.079
L'Merchant!

26:38.147 --> 26:40.980
The bloodline continues,
toy maker.

26:41.049 --> 26:45.145
I'm restless,
and you're bored.

26:47.156 --> 26:49.090
I think we should
see America.

26:49.158 --> 26:51.649
Screw America.

26:51.727 --> 26:54.753
Then I would like your permission
to go by myself.

26:59.668 --> 27:02.831
Don't you want to know
why I'd like to go?

27:05.841 --> 27:08.674
<i>Is that your final word?</i>

27:49.751 --> 27:53.619
Angelique,
let's make this clear.

27:53.689 --> 27:56.351
What you want
is irrelevant.

27:56.425 --> 27:59.360
It's about what I want.

27:59.428 --> 28:03.228
After 200 years, you should know
what those things are.

28:05.200 --> 28:08.067
Jacques,

28:08.136 --> 28:10.627
have I ever
disappointed you?

28:11.707 --> 28:14.505
- No.
- Close your eyes.

28:14.576 --> 28:17.477
- Don't move.
- Why?

28:19.214 --> 28:23.150
So you won't bruise.

28:23.218 --> 28:26.710
- Is this a new game?
- Oh, yes.

28:27.990 --> 28:30.151
<i>It might hurt... </i>

28:33.662 --> 28:36.426
Just a little.

28:40.736 --> 28:44.263
<i> Jacques, do you remember
De L 'Isle's lesson?</i>

28:48.010 --> 28:50.501
Perhaps I was a bit hasty.

28:51.446 --> 28:55.849
Enjoy.

28:58.353 --> 29:01.584
<i>I forget.
You like it rough, don't you?</i>

29:01.657 --> 29:04.888
<i>Please!</i>

29:04.960 --> 29:08.452
Yes, you like it rough!

29:30.652 --> 29:32.586
<i>It hurts. </i>

29:33.221 --> 29:35.382
It hurts.

29:38.660 --> 29:41.493
Oh, please. Please.

29:44.566 --> 29:49.060
You broke the number-one rule, Jacques.

29:49.137 --> 29:51.071
You tried to stand
in hell's way.

29:51.139 --> 29:53.369
What are you talking about?

29:53.442 --> 29:57.378
The toy maker's bloodline
has survived.

30:00.248 --> 30:03.775
The box.

30:03.852 --> 30:05.786
America.

30:57.305 --> 30:59.637
<i> It's both
my pleasure and honor... </i>

30:59.708 --> 31:02.768
to present this award on behalf
of the architectural community...

31:02.844 --> 31:05.506
to Mr. John Merchant.

31:05.580 --> 31:07.514
John.

31:13.155 --> 31:15.089
Thank you.

31:15.157 --> 31:17.352
I've always thought
that the...

31:17.426 --> 31:20.020
applause from your peers
is the best kind of applause,

31:20.095 --> 31:23.826
and I am truly touched
by, uh, your reception...

31:24.966 --> 31:27.196
and by this award.

31:32.541 --> 31:34.475
Originally,
when I had put myself...

31:46.088 --> 31:49.285
Leonardo da Vinci
once said that no work of art...

31:49.357 --> 31:51.382
is ever completed,

31:51.460 --> 31:53.451
only abandoned.

31:53.528 --> 31:56.656
And I never understood
what he meant until now.

32:02.337 --> 32:05.500
Thank you.
Good night.

32:05.574 --> 32:08.975
Very nice speech.

32:13.381 --> 32:16.179
<i>Honey, it's okay.
Let's just go. </i>

32:18.987 --> 32:22.150
<i> Toy maker. </i>

32:22.224 --> 32:25.455
<i> I know I brought it with me. </i>

32:35.237 --> 32:37.364
- Idiot!
- I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

32:37.439 --> 32:40.033
- I didn't even see you.
- Oh, forgive me.

32:40.108 --> 32:42.702
- I'm very sorry.
- That was very rude.

32:46.381 --> 32:49.282
Now I'll have to think of a way
to make it up to you.

32:54.990 --> 32:59.120
<i>Why are we going to the basement?
At least tell me your name. </i>

32:59.194 --> 33:02.061
Do we really need to know
each other's names?

33:02.130 --> 33:04.826
Mystery woman, huh?

33:04.900 --> 33:07.630
Aren't you excited
by mystery?

33:07.702 --> 33:10.500
Ooh, yeah. You bet.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.705
You seem to be pretty
familiar with this place.

33:14.776 --> 33:18.075
I'm just following
my instincts.

33:25.053 --> 33:26.987
Do you like games?

33:28.423 --> 33:30.357
You're a dream.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.027
Almost.

33:48.877 --> 33:52.005
<i>Close your eyes.
Trust me. </i>

33:52.080 --> 33:54.014
Okay.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.199
What's going on?

34:17.105 --> 34:19.335
Can I look now?

34:19.407 --> 34:21.341
<i>You can look now. </i>

34:24.946 --> 34:28.177
Time to play another game.

34:37.592 --> 34:39.525
I have such sights
to show you.

34:41.295 --> 34:43.230
All right.

35:40.789 --> 35:43.952
What's happening?

36:27.569 --> 36:30.163
Angelique.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.845
Things seem to have changed.

36:46.921 --> 36:52.689
Hell is more ordered
since your time, Princess.

36:52.761 --> 36:56.162
And much less amusing.

36:59.033 --> 37:03.299
<i>- The box did this?
- A man did this. </i>

37:03.371 --> 37:08.104
But the box called him.
It called to his blood.

37:08.176 --> 37:10.110
His ancestor made the box...

37:10.178 --> 37:13.579
<i>and would have unmade
all of us. </i>

37:13.648 --> 37:16.947
You've been away too long,
Princess.

37:17.018 --> 37:20.112
This is not a room.

37:20.188 --> 37:23.555
This is a holocaust...

37:23.625 --> 37:26.958
waiting to wake itself.

37:31.032 --> 37:33.500
If we could just move
this whole thing right up...

37:33.568 --> 37:35.661
to give it
a little more height.

37:35.737 --> 37:38.297
- There's a woman here to see you.
- Tell her to have a seat, okay?

37:38.373 --> 37:41.570
<i>- Okay.
-  John Merchant and Associates. </i>

37:48.383 --> 37:50.317
I know you.

37:50.385 --> 37:53.684
You've no idea what a pleasure
it is to meet you again.

37:56.724 --> 37:59.284
This is all very good.

38:00.595 --> 38:02.790
You're the one
we've been waiting for.

38:02.864 --> 38:05.628
Who are you?

38:05.700 --> 38:08.168
A friend, I hope.

38:09.304 --> 38:11.295
A client, I'm sure.

38:21.916 --> 38:23.850
Is this yours?

38:23.918 --> 38:25.852
No.

38:30.959 --> 38:33.655
This has been in my family
for hundreds of years.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.424
<i>I'm working on something
based on it. </i>

38:36.498 --> 38:38.830
- May I see it?
- Nobody's seen it.

38:40.301 --> 38:42.428
Then let me be the first.

38:42.504 --> 38:47.134
<i>To put it simply, it's something
I want to do with mirrors and lasers. </i>

38:47.208 --> 38:51.542
See, in theory, it's possible.

38:51.613 --> 38:54.946
Perpetual light.

38:55.016 --> 38:58.179
<i>Trapped light feeding off
its own reflections. </i>

39:01.890 --> 39:03.824
<i> I haven't perfected
the light yet. </i>

39:03.892 --> 39:06.622
<i>Something's missing,
and I can't make it work. </i>

39:06.694 --> 39:09.128
<i>It'll go for a few seconds... </i>

39:09.197 --> 39:11.631
then it'll blink out.

39:15.203 --> 39:18.036
<i>Sometimes a few seconds
are more than enough,</i>

39:18.106 --> 39:20.040
<i>toy maker. </i>

39:22.777 --> 39:24.711
What did you call me?

39:26.214 --> 39:30.082
You think you don't remember,
but your blood knows.

39:30.151 --> 39:32.085
Let it remind you.

39:35.223 --> 39:38.158
- Angelique.
- You know me from dreams.

39:38.226 --> 39:41.161
John Merchant.
John L'Merchant.

39:44.098 --> 39:46.760
We have a destiny...

39:46.834 --> 39:48.768
together.

39:50.338 --> 39:52.272
I don't believe in destiny.

39:53.675 --> 39:56.644
You think your work
on the building was an accident?

39:56.711 --> 39:58.702
It called to you, John.

40:00.448 --> 40:02.916
We have great work to do.

40:02.984 --> 40:04.918
I shall be in touch.

40:50.131 --> 40:53.567
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.

41:01.175 --> 41:04.269
What time is it?

41:06.814 --> 41:10.511
- Hello.
- L'Merchant.

41:10.585 --> 41:13.179
I have to see you.

41:13.254 --> 41:15.188
<i>-  Can we meet? Today.
-  Yeah. Okay. </i>

41:15.256 --> 41:17.622
<i>-  We'll go over it tomorrow.
- At your office.</i>

41:17.692 --> 41:20.786
Okay. Bye.

41:20.862 --> 41:23.023
Business.

41:23.097 --> 41:25.827
Some Japanese client.
Got no sense of time.

41:39.180 --> 41:43.378
I grow impatient
with the Princess.

41:43.451 --> 41:48.286
Human acquiescence is as easily
obtained by terror...

41:48.356 --> 41:50.551
as by temptation.

42:02.003 --> 42:05.268
- New building.
- Must be.

42:05.339 --> 42:08.570
- Settling?
- Yeah. Settling.

42:08.643 --> 42:11.669
Still hungry?

42:11.746 --> 42:16.410
Ready for something that screams?

42:18.319 --> 42:21.049
<i> So she starts
asking me all kinds of weird questions. </i>

42:21.122 --> 42:23.181
<i>Like what?</i>

42:23.257 --> 42:26.693
Like, would I do it with a woman
that used to be a man?

42:26.761 --> 42:29.491
- Like with a guy that had it cut off?
- Yeah.

42:29.564 --> 42:32.397
Hormones, the whole bit.

42:32.467 --> 42:35.493
- So, what'd you say?
- I mean, I guess so.

42:35.570 --> 42:37.936
If she was cut
and all.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.471
- What's this?
- It's a door.

42:44.545 --> 42:47.878
<i>I know it's a door,
but it isn't on the chart. </i>

42:49.283 --> 42:51.217
Genius college boys.

43:30.992 --> 43:34.826
A pity the mirror will not
show your true beauty, Princess.

43:34.896 --> 43:39.356
Your human admirer
may not sense it,

43:39.433 --> 43:44.700
but I can smell
the exquisite stench...

43:44.772 --> 43:47.297
of what you really are!

43:47.375 --> 43:50.833
<i> You know, I'm starting
not to like this so much. </i>

43:50.912 --> 43:54.177
- You know, I was just thinking the same thing.
- Well, maybe...

43:54.248 --> 43:56.182
Shit!

44:02.890 --> 44:06.451
<i>- We should check it out.
- Speak for yourself.</i>

44:09.163 --> 44:12.030
This is getting weird.

44:12.099 --> 44:14.033
You coming?

44:14.101 --> 44:16.865
<i>Go ahead.
Check it out. </i>

44:16.938 --> 44:18.872
Well, at least
watch my back.

44:18.940 --> 44:20.874
You got it.

44:34.121 --> 44:38.353
You look like death, Princess.

44:49.270 --> 44:52.205
Temptation is illusion.

44:52.273 --> 44:55.299
But the time for trickery
is past.

44:55.376 --> 44:59.039
In this game, we show ourselves
as we really are.

45:00.615 --> 45:02.549
What's that?

45:02.617 --> 45:04.744
The beauty of suffering.

45:07.121 --> 45:10.147
You are no different
from that beast...

45:10.224 --> 45:13.352
that sucks the bones
you throw to it.

45:15.529 --> 45:18.464
And you, Princess.

45:18.532 --> 45:20.898
What are you?

45:58.506 --> 46:03.136
You scared the shit out
of me, man! What's wrong with you?

46:03.210 --> 46:05.371
My flashlight died.
I tripped and fell.

46:05.446 --> 46:07.676
<i>From now on,
we stick together. Always. </i>

46:07.748 --> 46:10.308
Together. Right.

46:24.565 --> 46:28.228
Someone's messing
with our heads.

46:34.575 --> 46:37.840
<i> Freeze!</i>

46:37.912 --> 46:42.008
- Just back it up against the wall!
- You heard him. Back it up!

46:42.083 --> 46:44.051
Don't make us
put some pain on you.

46:44.118 --> 46:46.848
Pain?

46:46.921 --> 46:49.822
How dare you use that word.

46:49.890 --> 46:52.290
He's got pins
in his head.

46:52.360 --> 46:55.295
What you think of
as pain...

46:55.363 --> 46:58.298
is only a shadow.

46:58.366 --> 47:01.358
Pain has a face.

47:03.604 --> 47:06.471
Allow me to show it to you.

47:06.540 --> 47:09.737
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

47:09.810 --> 47:13.871
I... am... pain.

47:17.952 --> 47:21.479
I know your fear.

47:21.555 --> 47:23.489
I hear it.

47:25.426 --> 47:29.658
"Please, don't separate me
from my brother. "

47:31.198 --> 47:33.826
<i>I give you my word... </i>

47:33.901 --> 47:35.835
<i>that will never happen. </i>

47:38.639 --> 47:40.834
A lesson, Princess.

47:40.908 --> 47:45.004
<i>Work with me,
or for me. </i>

49:01.388 --> 49:05.484
Temptation is worthless,
Princess.

49:05.559 --> 49:08.585
<i>Suffering is the coin
of the realm. </i>

49:08.662 --> 49:12.928
I will teach your human Merchant
about the value of suffering.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.491
I will buy his secret...

49:15.569 --> 49:18.129
with a bounty of pain.

49:20.007 --> 49:22.635
<i>They say
the greatest suffering... </i>

49:22.710 --> 49:24.974
a parent can know...

49:26.180 --> 49:29.877
is the loss of a child.

49:41.395 --> 49:44.660
Honey, Mommy'll be back
in five minutes, okay?

49:45.766 --> 49:50.328
- Jack.
- Mom, I'm concentrating.

49:58.012 --> 50:01.072
<i>-  I don't know what I'm doing here.
-  I had to see you. </i>

50:05.219 --> 50:07.153
Whatever you want.

50:11.192 --> 50:13.820
We were good together, John.

50:15.462 --> 50:17.396
Yes.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.534
We will be again.

51:17.994 --> 51:21.657
<i> Mommy!</i>

51:39.382 --> 51:43.148
<i>Oh, God!</i>

51:43.219 --> 51:46.484
Oh, thank God!

51:46.556 --> 51:49.787
<i>-  Jack, honey, baby, come here.
- I can't, Mommy.</i>

51:49.859 --> 51:52.521
He won't let me.

51:54.330 --> 51:57.060
<i>What, baby?</i>

51:57.133 --> 51:59.431
<i>- Mom.
- Oh, God.</i>

51:59.502 --> 52:02.869
Young... unformed.

52:05.908 --> 52:08.968
Oh, what appetites
I could teach him.

52:09.045 --> 52:12.481
Just give him to me, please!

52:12.548 --> 52:15.381
Oh, you suffer beautifully.

52:15.451 --> 52:18.909
But I am here for business,
not pleasure.

52:18.988 --> 52:22.480
- Just tell me what you want.
- Oh, I want bait.

52:25.161 --> 52:27.686
Live bait.

52:33.870 --> 52:37.397
Bobbi! Jack!
Bobbi!

53:11.574 --> 53:13.508
You stay here.

54:29.051 --> 54:31.178
<i>Oh, thank God. </i>

54:31.253 --> 54:33.448
John, don't!

54:35.358 --> 54:37.849
<i>Easy. </i>

54:42.632 --> 54:46.466
I don't know who
or what you are...

54:46.535 --> 54:48.799
and I don't care.

54:48.871 --> 54:51.806
I just want my wife
and my kid back!

54:51.874 --> 54:54.536
Oh, I understand...

54:55.678 --> 54:57.612
how you love this boy.

54:57.680 --> 55:00.808
<i>You have plans for him. </i>

55:00.883 --> 55:03.317
<i>Hopes and dreams. </i>

55:03.386 --> 55:06.446
A whole imagined future...

55:06.522 --> 55:09.889
where you love him
and watch him grow.

55:09.959 --> 55:13.588
- Yes.
- Then complete your work.

55:14.797 --> 55:17.129
<i>Or, though the boy
will not die here,</i>

55:17.199 --> 55:21.431
for a thousand years his dearest wish
will be that he had!

55:21.504 --> 55:22.971
For God's sake!

55:23.039 --> 55:26.873
Do I look like someone
who cares what God thinks?

55:28.377 --> 55:30.641
Just tell me what you want.

55:35.084 --> 55:37.018
The box.

55:38.487 --> 55:41.217
<i>Apathway to hell... </i>

55:42.358 --> 55:45.794
made by
an ancestor of yours.

55:47.229 --> 55:49.857
The room downstairs...

55:49.932 --> 55:53.527
potentially
a bigger pathway.

55:57.339 --> 55:59.830
You will help...

55:59.909 --> 56:02.935
to fulfill its promise.

56:37.580 --> 56:39.878
Come on!

56:45.087 --> 56:48.488
Come on, Jack.

56:48.557 --> 56:50.491
This way.
Come on!

56:50.559 --> 56:53.323
- We're gonna split up. Take the other stairwell.
- What?

56:53.395 --> 56:57.354
I've got a plan. Jack, it'll be okay.
All right? You can do it.

57:04.707 --> 57:07.676
Come on, you bastard.
It's me you want.

57:07.743 --> 57:10.109
<i>Don't flatter yourself. </i>

57:10.179 --> 57:15.139
I don't want you, child.
I want what you were born with: A gift.

57:15.217 --> 57:17.651
The lights.

57:17.720 --> 57:22.180
<i>Oh, no. Not light.
Darkness is where you find me. </i>

57:26.796 --> 57:30.789
<i>Good.
Stand your ground. </i>

57:31.500 --> 57:33.434
Family man.

57:36.205 --> 57:39.003
The box,

57:39.074 --> 57:41.565
once thought so powerful,

57:41.644 --> 57:43.578
is only a model.

57:43.646 --> 57:48.106
<i>What you will give me
is the true version. </i>

57:48.184 --> 57:51.176
No longer will we have to
seep into your world...

57:51.253 --> 57:54.188
like pests through cracks
in the baseboards.

57:54.256 --> 57:57.419
Once and for all,
we will open the gates,

57:57.493 --> 57:59.552
lay low the ramparts.

58:01.197 --> 58:03.461
<i>Isn't that what the Princess
wants from you?</i>

58:03.532 --> 58:07.229
Isn't that the game
that you two have been playing?

58:07.303 --> 58:10.636
- This isn't a game.
- Oh, yes.

58:10.706 --> 58:13.869
<i>This is a game.</i>

58:15.244 --> 58:18.042
And now it is time...

58:18.113 --> 58:20.047
to play.

58:21.750 --> 58:24.514
I shall go first.

58:28.724 --> 58:31.090
Daddy!

58:32.728 --> 58:34.753
<i>Run!</i>

58:34.830 --> 58:40.427
It is time to open
the pathway... forever.

58:44.740 --> 58:47.265
<i>That's impossible!</i>

58:57.686 --> 59:01.213
No. No!

59:27.616 --> 59:30.710
Does this pathway
work both ways?

59:36.725 --> 59:38.989
<i>Toy maker. </i>

59:39.061 --> 59:41.256
Come here, Jack!

59:43.465 --> 59:46.093
So young.

59:46.168 --> 59:49.569
So tender.

59:49.638 --> 59:51.765
<i>- So ripe.
-  Daddy!</i>

59:51.840 --> 59:56.004
- Get your hands off of him!
- Get your hands on the console, toy maker.

59:56.078 --> 59:59.104
<i>You have work to do. </i>

01:00:05.454 --> 01:00:08.389
<i> Open the pathway for me!</i>

01:00:15.731 --> 01:00:18.529
The toy maker's design.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.914
Do it!

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.087
- Jack!
- Daddy!

01:00:56.405 --> 01:01:00.466
- Run, Jack!
- No more games.

01:01:22.031 --> 01:01:24.465
- Jack!
- Mommy!

01:01:24.533 --> 01:01:27.991
You go play with your dog,
you bastard!

01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:08.843
The boy lived.

01:02:08.911 --> 01:02:10.970
He carried
the bloodline,

01:02:11.046 --> 01:02:14.573
the guilt for what
our family had begun.

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:17.915
And how to undo it.
Did he carry that too?

01:02:17.986 --> 01:02:22.184
Yes. It was passed down
through the generations.

01:02:23.992 --> 01:02:27.689
It came upon me first
in my dreams.

01:02:27.763 --> 01:02:30.425
My blood was speaking to me
while I slept,

01:02:30.499 --> 01:02:33.525
telling me to make good the damage
L'Merchant had done...

01:02:33.602 --> 01:02:36.571
all those centuries ago.

01:02:37.739 --> 01:02:39.798
Dr. Merchant,
what were you doing...

01:02:39.875 --> 01:02:43.606
when Parker and I found you
in your cabin?

01:02:43.679 --> 01:02:47.513
<i>Summoning a demon
or two. </i>

01:02:47.583 --> 01:02:49.517
Maybe more.

01:02:49.585 --> 01:02:53.146
<i>- And did you succeed?
- Oh, yes. </i>

01:02:53.222 --> 01:02:56.555
It was much easier
than I thought.

01:03:48.644 --> 01:03:51.169
Merchant, do you hear me?

01:03:54.683 --> 01:03:56.651
I know you're watching.

01:04:01.623 --> 01:04:05.184
We'd almost given up
waiting for you to play.

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:08.093
Long wait, demon,

01:04:08.163 --> 01:04:10.097
for such a short game.

01:04:10.165 --> 01:04:13.623
Short? Ohh.

01:04:13.702 --> 01:04:17.502
Is that any way to treat
an old friend of the family?

01:04:17.573 --> 01:04:22.169
<i>No. Tell the truth,
Merchant. </i>

01:04:22.244 --> 01:04:25.236
You're pleased to see me.

01:04:25.314 --> 01:04:27.509
Your impatience...

01:04:27.583 --> 01:04:29.744
has matched my own.

01:04:29.818 --> 01:04:31.843
Perhaps.

01:04:34.489 --> 01:04:38.516
But now curiosity
is satisfied.

01:04:38.594 --> 01:04:40.494
<i>And it's time for revenge. </i>

01:04:40.562 --> 01:04:43.998
<i>Dr. Merchant,
consider yourself relieved. </i>

01:04:44.066 --> 01:04:46.591
Not now.
I let them out!

01:04:48.203 --> 01:04:50.797
What's wrong with this
is I don't believe in hell.

01:04:50.872 --> 01:04:54.171
<i>But it believes in you,
and it's out there right now. </i>

01:04:56.912 --> 01:04:58.846
I don't frighten easily.

01:04:58.914 --> 01:05:02.281
<i>Well, stop thinking
and start feeling!</i>

01:05:02.351 --> 01:05:05.377
Your gut knows that I'm
telling you the truth.

01:05:05.454 --> 01:05:09.686
There's something in this station
right now that wants our souls.

01:05:09.758 --> 01:05:13.216
And whether you believe in hell or not,
it's gonna take us there.

01:05:13.295 --> 01:05:17.391
<i>Solar alignment in place. </i>

01:05:17.466 --> 01:05:20.060
- Twenty-three minutes to
complete mission. -

01:05:20.135 --> 01:05:23.901
Please...
get off this station.

01:05:23.972 --> 01:05:26.839
Let me save
at least one soul.

01:05:26.908 --> 01:05:29.103
We go together,
or we don't go at all.

01:05:29.177 --> 01:05:32.704
Then we go together.
Just let me finish.

01:05:34.783 --> 01:05:38.480
Rimmer, we're pulling out as soon as
Parker finishes checking Merchant's cabin.

01:05:38.553 --> 01:05:42.614
Get him out of there now.
You don't know what they're capable of!

01:05:42.691 --> 01:05:47.526
Rimmer, escort the prisoner to his cell
and prepare to leave at 04:30 hours.

01:05:51.767 --> 01:05:53.701
What the...

01:05:58.774 --> 01:06:01.709
<i> Help! Help!</i>

01:06:01.777 --> 01:06:06.180
<i>- Save me! Hurry!
- My God!</i>

01:06:06.248 --> 01:06:08.682
<i>- We're trapped!
- Hurry!</i>

01:06:11.486 --> 01:06:14.922
<i>Help!
Get us out of here!</i>

01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:18.585
<i>Hurry!</i>

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.594
<i>In here!</i>

01:06:50.525 --> 01:06:52.459
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

01:06:52.527 --> 01:06:56.896
<i>The remnants of a most
unsatisfying victim. </i>

01:06:56.965 --> 01:06:59.695
<i>Still... </i>

01:06:59.768 --> 01:07:01.998
you're here
to change all that.

01:07:03.672 --> 01:07:05.765
<i>Aren't you?</i>

01:07:33.869 --> 01:07:35.962
<i> Merchant has a plan. </i>

01:07:37.372 --> 01:07:39.567
Kill them all.

01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:44.174
I keep trying to raise Parker.
He's not responding.

01:07:44.246 --> 01:07:46.510
- I'm going to go check it out.
- He's dead!

01:07:46.581 --> 01:07:50.142
And if you don't let me out to finish
my work, you're all dead!

01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:23.484
Chamberlain.

01:08:23.551 --> 01:08:27.078
Parker's dead.

01:08:27.154 --> 01:08:30.147
<i>- What?
- Parker's dead. </i>

01:08:30.225 --> 01:08:34.252
Oh, God.

01:08:34.328 --> 01:08:38.265
Don't know what the hell's
going on.

01:08:38.332 --> 01:08:41.234
Just remember:
Shoot first.

01:08:41.303 --> 01:08:43.237
<i>Out. </i>

01:09:19.006 --> 01:09:22.703
<i>Help me, please!
Please, help me!</i>

01:10:16.031 --> 01:10:19.660
Please.

01:10:19.734 --> 01:10:22.703
Help me.

01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:51.524
<i>Mr. Chamberlain?</i>

01:10:52.601 --> 01:10:54.728
What the fuck planet
are you from?

01:10:54.803 --> 01:10:58.170
<i>Come on. </i>

01:12:08.476 --> 01:12:12.572
- Can you still do it? Can you stop them?
- I can try.

01:12:12.647 --> 01:12:15.081
I need a couple of minutes to get
the coordinates locked in from here.

01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:17.550
Give you a chance to get to the ship.
Go. Now!

01:12:17.619 --> 01:12:21.715
<i>-  We can't leave without Carducci.
- Carducci, come in!</i>

01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:24.350
I'm going after him.
Get to the ship.

01:12:24.426 --> 01:12:26.917
That weapon
will not protect you!

01:12:29.664 --> 01:12:32.656
But I know something
that will.

01:12:58.727 --> 01:13:00.661
Oh, no.

01:13:02.197 --> 01:13:04.131
He said it could protect me.

01:13:04.199 --> 01:13:06.167
<i>He told me what to do. </i>

01:13:06.234 --> 01:13:08.168
Please, go ahead.

01:13:12.741 --> 01:13:16.575
It's a box.

01:13:16.644 --> 01:13:18.578
<i>It's just a box. </i>

01:13:20.815 --> 01:13:23.909
Thank God
for men of reason.

01:13:28.022 --> 01:13:29.887
<i> Finish it. </i>

01:14:33.655 --> 01:14:37.421
<i>Now the final movement
begins. </i>

01:14:39.761 --> 01:14:43.197
Soon the bloodline
will be severed.

01:14:46.034 --> 01:14:49.868
You and your ancestors have
proved worthy opponents.

01:14:49.938 --> 01:14:52.031
The taste of victory...

01:14:52.106 --> 01:14:54.870
is almost bittersweet.

01:15:02.483 --> 01:15:05.179
<i>Glorious, is it not?</i>

01:15:05.253 --> 01:15:07.915
<i>Perfect. </i>

01:15:07.989 --> 01:15:11.049
The creatures that walk
on its surface,

01:15:11.125 --> 01:15:13.821
always looking
to the light,

01:15:13.895 --> 01:15:18.525
never seeing the untold oceans
of darkness beyond.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:22.969
<i>There are more humans alive
at this moment... </i>

01:15:23.037 --> 01:15:26.996
than in all
its pitiful history.

01:15:29.043 --> 01:15:31.841
The Garden of Eden.

01:15:33.248 --> 01:15:37.116
A garden of flesh.

01:15:41.389 --> 01:15:44.517
<i>Nowhere to run this time,
toy maker. </i>

01:15:45.627 --> 01:15:47.561
No escape.

01:15:49.364 --> 01:15:52.026
Double back down this hallway
and get to the shuttle.

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:55.831
- You've got five minutes, Rimmer.
- Together, you said.

01:15:55.904 --> 01:15:58.896
- I'm not done here.
- Well, then, I don't go.

01:15:58.973 --> 01:16:01.203
I'm coming right after you.

01:16:01.276 --> 01:16:03.471
Just be ready.

01:16:03.544 --> 01:16:07.071
We're not gonna have much time
once this thing goes.

01:16:08.483 --> 01:16:10.417
Trust me.

01:16:10.485 --> 01:16:13.249
<i>I'm not going to sacrifice myself
if I can help it. </i>

01:16:13.321 --> 01:16:15.585
I'm not that crazy.

01:16:27.835 --> 01:16:29.996
Oh, my God.

01:16:47.755 --> 01:16:49.689
Here, doggie.

01:16:57.031 --> 01:17:00.467
Play dead.

01:17:11.379 --> 01:17:15.839
<i> Dr. Merchant,
two minutes to complete mission. </i>

01:17:15.917 --> 01:17:20.650
Two minutes.
Two centuries.

01:17:20.722 --> 01:17:24.283
It all ticks by
so quickly.

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:27.724
You are so very like
your ancestor.

01:17:27.795 --> 01:17:30.161
Did you know that?

01:17:30.231 --> 01:17:33.496
I have the distinct
sense of deja vu.

01:17:33.568 --> 01:17:36.128
The same defiance,

01:17:36.204 --> 01:17:40.231
the same faithless hope
in the light.

01:17:40.308 --> 01:17:43.505
<i>- And what do you have faith in?
- Nothing. </i>

01:17:43.578 --> 01:17:48.515
I am so exquisitely empty.

01:17:53.888 --> 01:17:57.324
Then it won't hurt you
to die.

01:17:57.392 --> 01:17:59.758
Will it?

01:17:59.827 --> 01:18:02.557
I cannot die.

01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:06.191
I am forever.

01:18:09.937 --> 01:18:14.965
<i> Dr. Merchant,
one minute to complete mission. </i>

01:18:17.445 --> 01:18:19.879
Where are you,
toy maker?

01:18:21.649 --> 01:18:24.584
Here.

01:18:24.652 --> 01:18:28.452
<i>Hologram. See, it's all done
with mirrors. </i>

01:18:28.523 --> 01:18:30.388
Like this.

01:18:39.634 --> 01:18:42.364
What have you done?

01:18:42.437 --> 01:18:44.769
I have faith in the light.

01:18:44.839 --> 01:18:47.774
<i>- What?
- The light, demon. The light. </i>

01:18:52.513 --> 01:18:55.710
- Endgame, demon.
- No!

01:18:57.485 --> 01:18:59.817
I cannot die!

01:19:44.565 --> 01:19:46.624
<i> Welcome to oblivion. </i>
