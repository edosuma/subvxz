WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:03.128
Previously on 90210:

00:03.253 --> 00:04.755
We don't let sophomores
sit with us.

00:04.880 --> 00:07.132
I'm not your ordinary sophomore.

00:07.257 --> 00:08.759
Hey, girlfriend.
Yes, boyfriend?

00:08.884 --> 00:11.929
Nothing, nothing.
I just like saying that.
I like hearing it.

00:12.053 --> 00:14.723
I'm going to lose everything!
No, no, you're not.
Give it to me.

00:14.849 --> 00:18.936
I can help you deal with this,
but you got to let me.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.772
Look at this. I need you to tell
them that the drugs were yours.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.357
MAN:
If she confesses
it should help,

00:23.482 --> 00:24.608
but you know there's
no guarantees.

00:24.733 --> 00:25.860
Adrianna's going
to be here.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.611
If you'll just give
her a few more minutes.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.321
I cannot believe
you did this to me.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.490
You were the one person that
I thought I could count on,

00:31.615 --> 00:32.616
that I could trust.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.743
Glad that you're
okay, I really am,

00:34.869 --> 00:37.120
but I can't keep watching
you do this to yourself,

00:37.245 --> 00:38.079
not anymore.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.582
I'm a virgin.
What?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.543
WOMAN:
When we ran your blood work,

00:42.668 --> 00:45.754
it turns out
you're pregnant.
No.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.631
What's Navid going to think?

00:47.756 --> 00:50.258
He's going to hate me.

00:57.098 --> 01:00.101
Oh, my friends back home
are so going to get a snow day.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.603
Those lucky bastards.

01:01.729 --> 01:05.524
I can't believe those guys.
Back home, huh?

01:05.649 --> 01:07.860
Back in Kansas, I mean.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.905
Hey, home is where
the heart is, Annie.

01:11.030 --> 01:13.240
So there's a blizzard
in Kansas.

01:13.365 --> 01:15.325
And a heat wave in L.A.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.744
Seriously, I'm wearing,
like, practically nothing.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.328
What kind of nothing?

01:18.453 --> 01:20.622
Um...

01:20.748 --> 01:24.459
Just a black
negligee.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.670
A negligee?

01:26.795 --> 01:30.257
It's black.
It's sort of sheer.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.341
Sort of...

01:31.466 --> 01:32.801
Hello?

01:32.927 --> 01:34.762
I'm on the phone!

01:34.887 --> 01:36.722
And you
shouldn't be.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.640
It's late, Annie.
Time to hang up.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.768
Good night, Ethan.

01:40.893 --> 01:42.728
Good night,
Mrs. Wilson.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.438
Time to hang up,
Annie.

01:44.563 --> 01:45.689
(sarcastically):
Fine!

01:45.814 --> 01:47.441
Annie, charge your
cell next time.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.818
I better go.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.570
Good night.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.364
Sweet dreams.
Sweet dreams.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.616
Annie.

01:55.741 --> 01:58.493
Yeah?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.245
I love you.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.874
I love you, too.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.926
Don't shoot till you see
the whites of their eyes.

02:14.051 --> 02:17.429
Come, children,
give me your muskets to clean.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.306
Um, it says, "Now
come, children,

02:19.431 --> 02:22.768
give Grandmother
your muskets to clean."

02:22.893 --> 02:25.646
I made a teensy adjustment.

02:25.771 --> 02:28.273
I'm just not sure I'm plausible
as a grandmother.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.067
ANNIE:
Yeah, well,
it's a miniseries

02:30.191 --> 02:32.527
about a 70-something
Revolutionary War hero

02:32.653 --> 02:34.071
who knits in her
spare time.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.197
I'm not so sure plausibility
is a top priority.

02:38.826 --> 02:42.746
Come, children, give Grandmother
your muskets to clean.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.539
Here is my musket.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.416
I do hope she
shoots straight.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.627
Ooh. The AC
was off.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.671
I want it off.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.213
It's better for
my vocal chords.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.632
It's nearly 90 degrees
in here.

02:53.757 --> 02:54.508
Aren't you sweltering?

02:54.633 --> 02:56.551
It is hot.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.179
These vocal chords are what put
this roof over our heads.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.892
Okay, guys,

03:04.018 --> 03:05.602
it's almost
time for school.

03:05.727 --> 03:06.937
And I happened to notice

03:07.062 --> 03:08.229
that the trash
hasn't gone out

03:08.355 --> 03:09.731
and the dishwasher
hasn't been emptied.

03:09.857 --> 03:13.568
They're helping me rehearse
Red Coats and Blue Bloods.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.696
Yeah, Grandma,
has an audition.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.364
And you have chores.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.616
Oh, please, I pay the help
to do those things.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.242
There's no need.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.285
There is a need.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.912
They're kids.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.246
They have chores
so they'll learn...

03:25.372 --> 03:28.375
What? How to take out
the trash?

03:28.500 --> 03:29.835
Is that really
what you want

03:29.960 --> 03:32.462
your children learning?

03:32.587 --> 03:34.506
Harry...

03:34.631 --> 03:36.383
What?

03:36.508 --> 03:38.385
Fine. I'll do the chores.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.512
The maid will do the chores.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.723
DIXON:
Um, you know what?

03:42.848 --> 03:44.016
We'll do the chores.

03:44.141 --> 03:47.061
Yep, here we go,
cleaning up.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.354
Oh, hey, can I have
the car this afternoon?

03:49.479 --> 03:51.857
I want to do
something with Ethan.
No can do.

03:51.982 --> 03:52.900
Got something to do
this afternoon.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.026
What?

03:54.151 --> 03:56.319
An extracurricular
activity.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.946
Okay, fine, then you
can do the chores.

03:58.072 --> 03:58.864
Break a leg today,
Grandma.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.657
Thanks, sweetie.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.326
Yeah, break a leg.
Thank you.

04:03.451 --> 04:04.619
Absolutely...

04:04.745 --> 04:06.413
break a leg.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.001
♪ ♪

04:17.632 --> 04:19.384
(bell ringing)

04:22.512 --> 04:23.847
You have a nice mouth.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.641
I'm glad you like it.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.309
Look, all I'm saying
is maybe it's not

04:28.435 --> 04:29.644
the end of the world.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.563
I'm sorry, my
optimistic friend,

04:31.688 --> 04:34.566
but the Santa Ana winds
do not blow in January.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.152
What we're dealing with here,
is global warming, i.e.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.072
the end of the world
as we know it, i.e.
the Apocalypse.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.365
Come on, Silver.
The Apocalypse?

04:42.490 --> 04:43.909
I'm not kidding.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.702
Look, one of
the seven signs.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.996
Excessive P.D.A.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.748
Hi, guys.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.792
Check Revelations, babe.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.712
So what's up, guys?

04:55.837 --> 04:57.089
I actually got to run.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.549
I got to grab a book from
the library before class.

04:59.674 --> 05:00.508
Bye, honey.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.136
Bye, baby.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.971
Actually, I'm gonna
take off, too.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.722
Unless you need
some help.

05:05.847 --> 05:06.681
No, I'm fine.

05:06.807 --> 05:07.724
I love you.

05:07.849 --> 05:08.809
I love you, too.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.685
Bye, guys.

05:10.811 --> 05:11.770
Later, guys.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.605
See ya, man.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.440
The phrase "gag me"
comes to mind.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.400
Why? They're happy.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.569
They're giving
me diabetes.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.863
All, "I love you."
"I love you."

05:21.989 --> 05:24.532
"I love you, snookums."
"I love you, Boo Boo."

05:24.658 --> 05:25.826
Please.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.708
(bell ringing)

05:33.834 --> 05:38.463
Never before did a Blaze
lighting test have such
a beautiful subject.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.840
(laughs softly)

05:39.965 --> 05:40.966
You're glowing.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.759
Glowing?
I'm not glowing.

05:42.884 --> 05:43.885
Yeah, you are.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.053
No, there's no glow

05:45.179 --> 05:46.554
emanating from over here.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.932
Trust me.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.391
Is everything all right?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.602
Are you happy?

05:52.727 --> 05:55.272
Like, I mean, with us?

05:55.438 --> 05:57.816
Seriously, I've never
been happier,

05:57.941 --> 05:59.860
with us or with anything else.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.611
I wouldn't change a thing.

06:01.736 --> 06:02.737
So you don't want
things to change?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.114
Hell, no.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.824
I mean, I love me
some Barack Obama,

06:05.949 --> 06:07.242
but in this case,
change is bad.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.787
This... you and me...

06:10.912 --> 06:12.080
us, everything

06:12.206 --> 06:14.166
is just exactly right.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.876
Seriously, I'm
really happy,

06:16.001 --> 06:17.878
Adrianna.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.881
Yeah, me, too.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.716
(whistle blowing)

06:22.841 --> 06:24.551
All right, I want to see
some hustle

06:24.676 --> 06:26.594
out there today, everybody.
NAOMI:
Really!

06:26.720 --> 06:28.513
With all due respect, it's
a hundred degrees out.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.974
It's not exactly
hustling weather.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.434
Use the heat, girls,
use the heat.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.436
Oh, my God.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.898
You two, what do you want?

06:38.023 --> 06:39.858
I have my period.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.026
I'm bleeding like

06:41.151 --> 06:42.652
a stuck pig.
I need to see the nurse.

06:42.777 --> 06:46.198
And you, Adrianna,
are you also menstruating?

06:46.323 --> 06:48.491
No, I'm not, but I have
a really bad headache.

06:48.616 --> 06:49.993
Maybe field hockey
would help.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.619
And maybe she
gets a migraine,

06:51.745 --> 06:54.539
falls on her field hockey stick
and-- (gasps)--

06:54.664 --> 06:56.624
oh, no, impales herself.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.960
Are you prepared to deal
with a lawsuit?

07:00.003 --> 07:02.214
Fine, go.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.840
But I'm warning you,
Ms. Clark,

07:03.965 --> 07:05.133
I'm gonna start
keeping track

07:05.259 --> 07:07.052
of your menstrual cycle.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.721
Oh, well, that's pathetic.

07:09.846 --> 07:10.805
(chuckles)

07:10.931 --> 07:11.848
Thanks.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.809
Hey, boys.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.145
Oh, my God!

07:17.271 --> 07:18.980
The AC must
be busted.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.565
I knew I should have
gone to Crossroads.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.026
This is such
a crock.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.444
So, how have you been?

07:24.569 --> 07:26.780
I feel like I haven't
seen you in ages.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.949
I know. You've been
hanging out with
your new friends

07:29.074 --> 07:30.033
and I've just
been busy.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.035
What's been going on?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.995
What are you up to?

07:34.121 --> 07:35.914
Do you want to have
dinner sometime?

07:36.039 --> 07:38.250
Sure, yeah, of course.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.878
I mean, you don't have to
if you don't want to.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.671
I just, um...

07:43.797 --> 07:46.341
I'm, uh...

07:48.302 --> 07:49.677
I'm going through something,

07:49.803 --> 07:54.099
and I thought I knew
how to handle it,
but I don't.

07:54.224 --> 07:58.853
And I just, I... I really need
someone to talk to.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.773
In private.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.194
You're going through something?

08:09.864 --> 08:12.617
Yeah, we'll do dinner.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.868
We'll set it up. I...
PORTIA:
Naomi.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.498
Um, actually I have to go,
so I'll see you later.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.085
Hey, guys, what's up?

08:22.210 --> 08:25.130
TASHA:
The heat totally
melted my drink.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.173
It tastes like coffee. Ugh.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.049
It is coffee,
Tasha.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.135
What's wrong,
Naomi?

08:30.260 --> 08:32.011
Nothing. It's just...

08:32.136 --> 08:34.014
You guys know
my old friend Adrianna?

08:34.139 --> 08:35.265
Yeah, the druggie-- sorry,
ex-druggie now.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.640
Yeah.

08:36.765 --> 08:37.976
I think she's using again.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.144
Well, what can you do?

08:39.269 --> 08:40.854
You already tried
to help her once, right?

08:40.979 --> 08:42.356
I just don't know
how I'm supposed to be

08:42.481 --> 08:44.065
friends with a girl like her.
TASHA:
You're not, Naomi.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.108
I mean, I know
you're upset,

08:45.233 --> 08:46.151
but she's not worth it.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.944
God, it just pisses me off
so much!

08:48.069 --> 08:49.488
What's with her?

08:49.612 --> 08:51.531
I mean, why is she such
a train wreck druggie?

08:51.656 --> 08:53.283
I don't know, but I know
she's not your problem.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.160
(bell ringing)

08:55.285 --> 08:58.163
And you add 20
of the sulfuric acid

08:58.288 --> 09:00.540
into to your beaker
and heat until it's boiling.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.920
Great job, Adrianna.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.674
Bet Adrianna would
like to drop some
of that sulfuric acid.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.426
Yeah, good one.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.598
Oh, my God!

09:17.724 --> 09:19.767
Everyone stay in your seats.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.269
Adrianna? Adrianna,
can you hear me?

09:21.395 --> 09:22.854
Adrianna? Don't try to move.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.523
Stay there. I'm going
to get the nurse.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.150
I can't believe this
is happening again.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.069
She's not your problem.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.924
Nice.
(chuckles)

09:51.049 --> 09:53.260
You're nice.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.929
What are you two, in heat?

09:56.054 --> 09:58.181
Hey, uh, how about
a little privacy, Silver?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.225
Mm, how about a little
discretion, Ethan?

10:00.350 --> 10:01.976
Annie, I need those keys.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.187
Huh? Oh, yeah.

10:04.312 --> 10:07.107
Um, Dixon has
a mysterious

10:07.232 --> 10:08.733
extracurricular activity

10:08.858 --> 10:10.235
that he doesn't want
to talk about.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.694
What? Tell me.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.154
It's no big deal.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.906
I just joined
the choir.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.033
(laughs)

10:17.158 --> 10:19.327
You're singing
in the choir?

10:19.453 --> 10:21.996
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.331
Uh, nothing.

10:23.457 --> 10:24.791
Nothing.
I mean, it's

10:24.916 --> 10:25.917
an organized

10:26.042 --> 10:28.044
school activity
where nerds stand on risers

10:28.169 --> 10:30.004
and sing an
a capella version of

10:30.130 --> 10:31.714
"The Lion Sleeps Tonight."
I mean, how cool can you get?

10:31.839 --> 10:33.550
Am I right?
(laughs)

10:33.674 --> 10:38.096
Is it true that
the choirmaster's
biggest credit

10:38.221 --> 10:40.014
is backup singer in a pet-stain
remover commercial?

10:40.140 --> 10:41.349
'Cause that's rad.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.312
We can pretend
it's just you and me.

10:45.437 --> 10:46.187
BOTH:
Mm-hmm
(beep)

10:46.313 --> 10:48.189
Hello, West Beverly.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.608
And my dad.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.485
We're in the middle
of a heat wave,

10:51.610 --> 10:53.570
and as you've probably noticed,
the AC is broken.

10:53.694 --> 10:56.323
Unfortunately, it won't be fixed
for at least another day.

10:56.448 --> 10:57.865
(all groan)

10:57.991 --> 10:59.326
Today's classes will continue
as scheduled,

10:59.451 --> 11:02.329
but-- and I know that this
will disappoint you all--

11:02.454 --> 11:05.248
school tomorrow is canceled.

11:05.373 --> 11:06.916
Wha...?! Yes!

11:07.041 --> 11:07.250
(all cheering)

11:07.375 --> 11:08.751
Beach party!

11:08.876 --> 11:10.253
Beach party!

11:10.378 --> 11:11.838
(kids cheering)

11:11.963 --> 11:14.424
(bell ringing)
Yeah!

11:20.054 --> 11:21.806
Navid!

11:24.518 --> 11:26.436
Well, there's no Navid
standing behind you,

11:26.561 --> 11:27.770
now is there, honey?

11:27.895 --> 11:28.813
Okay, what's your problem?

11:28.938 --> 11:29.981
I don't have
a problem.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.442
You do.
Your girlfriend's using again.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.152
Using? Drugs?
No, I don't think so.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.362
I'd know, wouldn't I?

11:35.487 --> 11:38.365
She's not always
my responsibility, Navid.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.325
(scoffs)
Who said she was?

11:40.450 --> 11:42.701
Get over yourself, Naomi.

11:44.745 --> 11:47.415
I really was hoping
that we could hang out alone.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.083
I promised my brother.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.877
Tomorrow, though,
it's just you and
me, girl.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.420
And a beach full
of classmates.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.755
Mm, yeah,
I did really,

11:54.881 --> 11:57.217
really just want to be
alone with you.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.971
(horn beeps twice)
Annie!

12:02.096 --> 12:03.806
Yoo-hoo!

12:03.931 --> 12:05.724
Annie!
Hi!

12:08.603 --> 12:11.730
A-A car? A car with a bow?

12:13.483 --> 12:14.401
A car with a bow for me?

12:14.526 --> 12:16.570
For you and your brother.
You like it?

12:16.695 --> 12:20.240
Yes! I mean, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes!

12:20.365 --> 12:22.242
No.
Okay, I get that

12:22.367 --> 12:23.493
you don't want
to give me

12:23.618 --> 12:25.245
a car, but to take
away a car,

12:25.370 --> 12:26.913
a perfectly good car,
just to prove a point?

12:27.038 --> 12:29.040
Another car would be handy...

12:29.165 --> 12:31.042
but you should've
run it by us first.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.919
I was pretty explicit

12:33.044 --> 12:34.087
about this, Tabitha.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.673
I said, no car,
and I meant no car.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.092
You said no car
for Annie's birthday.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.385
This is not
a birthday car.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.844
The kids got
good grades

12:41.969 --> 12:43.513
last term,
and they need a car.

12:43.638 --> 12:44.931
Thank you, Grandma.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.391
She-She's right,
okay? We do.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.435
No, you don't need a car.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.519
No 16-year-old

12:49.644 --> 12:50.811
needs a car.

12:50.937 --> 12:51.896
There are kids

12:52.021 --> 12:53.481
in other countries
without shoes

12:53.607 --> 12:55.108
and you think
you need a car?

12:55.233 --> 12:56.359
Okay, I want a car.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.860
A car would be
useful.

12:57.985 --> 12:58.903
I-I am grateful

12:59.028 --> 13:00.196
for my shoes,
but I would be

13:00.321 --> 13:01.364
very grateful for a car.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.781
Daddy?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.119
Deb?

13:06.244 --> 13:07.912
Where are the keys?

13:14.419 --> 13:16.546
The car is going back.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.214
And I'm going

13:18.339 --> 13:20.634
to take a nice icy cold bath.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.344
Wow, whose car is that
in the driveway?

13:23.470 --> 13:26.055
Not ours.
(sighs)

13:37.692 --> 13:39.778
You know,
I don't think

13:39.902 --> 13:42.238
they did Tai Chi
in Colonial New England.

13:42.363 --> 13:46.367
Your agita is messing
with my Chi, dear.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.328
I'm sorry, but

13:48.453 --> 13:49.579
you know what kind of sucks?

13:49.704 --> 13:51.581
What's that?
Being a teenager.

13:51.706 --> 13:54.334
Okay, it's like everything is in
a conspiracy against you.

13:54.459 --> 13:55.669
You're always being told

13:55.794 --> 13:58.129
what you can do
and where you
have to be.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.673
Nothing's in
your control.

13:59.798 --> 14:02.509
I mean, you can't have freedom
and you can't have space,

14:02.634 --> 14:05.261
but you can't get anywhere
'cause you can't have a car.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.887
I'm sick of it.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.389
I'm hot
and I'm tired

14:08.515 --> 14:10.933
and I'm tired
of being a teenager.

14:11.058 --> 14:13.394
I think you have a point.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.937
I have something for you.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.610
Keys. Oh, Grandma,
we tried this.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.570
These are not car keys.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.989
They're keys
to my Palms Springs getaway.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.282
You need to get away.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.701
Be by yourself.

14:27.826 --> 14:30.453
Have some freedom,
have some space.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.163
Really?
What better place

14:32.288 --> 14:34.499
to chill out than the desert?

14:34.624 --> 14:36.417
But my mother would...

14:36.543 --> 14:39.045
I already asked her.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.755
You're good to go.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.137
♪ ♪

14:52.809 --> 14:54.394
Burger, club,
double fries.

14:54.519 --> 14:55.478
Someone's hungry.

14:55.603 --> 14:56.855
Heat makes me hungry, bro.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.606
Hey, you and Silver
going to the beach later?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.567
I don't know, man.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.236
She may have plans already
preparing for the Apocalypse

15:03.361 --> 15:05.154
with her "The end is nigh" sign.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.490
Oh, do I detect
trouble in paradise?

15:07.615 --> 15:09.200
Nah, man.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.911
You know, Silver's a little
much sometimes

15:12.036 --> 15:14.873
with the whole negativity
and moodiness.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.416
Come on, man,
that's part of her charm.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.167
She has that whole dissenting-
voice thing going on, you know?

15:18.292 --> 15:19.836
She questions things.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.128
It's who she is,
it's what she does.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.380
She mocks everything, man.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.090
My sister said, "I love you"
to her boyfriend,

15:24.215 --> 15:25.466
she has a field day.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.593
All right, you know what?
Let me tell you something.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.386
And this is drawing

15:28.511 --> 15:31.389
from my vast experience
with women, okay?

15:31.514 --> 15:33.558
Why would Silver mock Annie and
Ethan's "I love you's," huh?

15:35.852 --> 15:37.771
Sour grapes, baby, sour grapes.

15:39.564 --> 15:40.648
So you-you mean...

15:40.774 --> 15:42.108
That chick loves you, man.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.026
And she wants you to say it
to her.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.278
So say it to her.

15:45.403 --> 15:46.446
You think?

15:46.571 --> 15:48.155
Dude, I know.
I'm outta here, bro.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.490
I'll see you at the sea, bro.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.702
Hey, man, where's my tip?!

15:52.827 --> 15:57.039
I gave you a tip, my friend,
A big tip. Sour grapes.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.083
Sorry about that.
My bad.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.546
She turned up the heat!

16:03.671 --> 16:04.798
Who did what?

16:04.923 --> 16:06.466
Your mother--
she turned up the heat

16:06.591 --> 16:08.217
for her precious
vocal cords,

16:08.342 --> 16:09.385
I'm sure.
I've had it, Harry!

16:09.510 --> 16:10.720
I have had it!

16:10.845 --> 16:13.306
Take it easy. We will turn
the thermostat down.

16:13.431 --> 16:14.974
Oh, I did, and you know
what she did?

16:15.099 --> 16:16.434
She turned it up!
And you know what I did?

16:16.559 --> 16:17.602
I turned it down.

16:17.727 --> 16:19.395
And you know what she did?
She turned it up!

16:19.520 --> 16:21.272
And you know what you did?
Nothing!

16:21.397 --> 16:22.356
Absolutely nothing!

16:22.482 --> 16:23.650
What am I supposed to do?!

16:23.775 --> 16:25.526
You are my mother,
she is my wife...

16:26.778 --> 16:29.697
You are my wife,
she is my mother.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.157
You are two powerful women,

16:31.282 --> 16:32.283
and I respect
you both.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.661
But we're the parents,
you and I.

16:34.786 --> 16:35.578
But we live
under her roof.

16:35.703 --> 16:36.704
Maybe we shouldn't.

16:38.623 --> 16:41.417
I need you, Harry.
I can't do this alone.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.711
(sighs)
Deb, where are you going?!

16:43.837 --> 16:45.672
To turn down
the thermostat.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.716
(sighs)

16:48.842 --> 16:50.217
(kids laughing)

17:00.227 --> 17:02.522
I shouldn't be here.

17:02.647 --> 17:07.443
I don't want to...

17:07.568 --> 17:09.820
I shouldn't care about you, Ade.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.781
How did you even know
I was here?

17:12.906 --> 17:16.536
Talked to your mom,
delightful creature that she is.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.538
Said you were at
the library,

17:18.663 --> 17:19.664
so I figured...

17:19.789 --> 17:20.707
You know me

17:20.832 --> 17:22.415
pretty well, I guess.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.795
Yeah, I do.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.589
And I also know
you're using drugs again.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.675
What? No!

17:30.800 --> 17:32.385
You're gonna lie to me again?

17:32.510 --> 17:35.137
Really?
That's great.
That's fabulous.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.723
You know what?
This was a stupid idea.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.098
I'm gonna go.

17:38.224 --> 17:41.101
I'm... I'm pregnant.

17:48.526 --> 17:49.652
You're...?

17:49.777 --> 17:51.362
I'm pregnant.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.280
Pregnant pregnant?

17:57.368 --> 17:58.703
Oh, honey.

18:00.914 --> 18:05.585
Yeah, it's crazy,
right?

18:05.710 --> 18:06.753
So you fainted
because you...

18:06.878 --> 18:08.671
Because I feel
like crap.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.548
What are you gonna do?

18:10.673 --> 18:14.301
I have no clue.

18:15.678 --> 18:18.056
Who's the father?

18:18.180 --> 18:21.434
I think this guy named Hank
who I know from rehab.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.311
But I don't know really.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.980
Are you okay?

18:28.274 --> 18:30.109
I'm scared.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.531
Yeah.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.913
Hey,

18:42.038 --> 18:43.831
you want to go
to Palm Springs?

18:43.957 --> 18:45.416
Where?

18:45.541 --> 18:47.085
Palm Springs.
I got the keys

18:47.209 --> 18:49.462
to my grandma's house
in Palm Springs.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.881
Where we could be alone.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.467
Totally alone.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.677
You want to blow off the beach
party so you and me can

18:56.803 --> 18:59.305
go to Palm Springs?

18:59.430 --> 19:03.893
I'm ready. I'm ready to go

Hey, we don't have
to do this today.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.978
No, it's okay,
I want to.

19:47.103 --> 19:50.230

I would show up.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.942

31:06.365 --> 31:08.367
Harry.
What?

31:08.492 --> 31:10.243
What are we doing?

31:10.369 --> 31:12.037
I don't know.
I don't know.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.499
It is probably good

31:15.624 --> 31:17.376
for her to have some time
away from her parents.

31:17.501 --> 31:19.085
So you're saying
we shouldn't
just bust in there?

31:19.211 --> 31:20.920
I think not.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.965
You know, I think
I've been second-guessing

31:24.090 --> 31:27.093
myself in the parenting
department lately.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.304
Why? Because of Sean?

31:29.429 --> 31:32.307
I guess. Sorry.

31:32.432 --> 31:34.685
I know that that's made things
harder on you.

31:34.810 --> 31:37.062
Well, your mother's tried
to pick up the slack.

31:37.187 --> 31:38.271
As I said.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.815
It's okay.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.025
I guess we're all just trying
to do our best.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.402
Even your mother.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.237
Although I can't say

31:45.362 --> 31:46.279
I mind getting away.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.324
I agree.

31:55.622 --> 31:58.667
You smell so good.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.131
What?

32:07.426 --> 32:10.011
Do I have sand on my face
or something?

32:10.136 --> 32:11.096
No.

32:11.221 --> 32:12.681
Uh, no.

32:12.806 --> 32:14.974
Look, um...

32:18.478 --> 32:21.565
I love you.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.950
Thank you.

32:33.243 --> 32:35.412
"Thank you"?

32:35.537 --> 32:37.581
I don't know what to say.

32:37.706 --> 32:39.458
Don't say anything.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.501
Just... forget it.

32:41.627 --> 32:45.004
What...
I have to say something back?

32:45.130 --> 32:47.507
It's obligatory?

32:47.633 --> 32:49.593
Just... forget it, all right?

32:49.718 --> 32:51.428
And now you're mad at me.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.472
That's fantastic.

32:53.597 --> 32:55.474
One minute you love me, and the
next minute you're mad at me?

32:55.599 --> 32:56.266
Whatever, Silver.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.393
No.

32:58.518 --> 32:59.645
It's not fair.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.104
I didn't do anything.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.564
Why are you mad at me?

33:02.689 --> 33:04.483
Because I didn't say
exactly what you said to me?

33:04.608 --> 33:05.859
Is that why you're mad?

33:05.984 --> 33:08.194
Because if that's what you want
to do, I'll do it.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.572
Or you could just
hold up some cue cards
Hey...

33:10.697 --> 33:11.698
then I can read
what you want me to say.

33:11.824 --> 33:12.825
You're overreacting.

33:12.950 --> 33:14.326
No, I'm not.
I'm just reacting.

33:14.451 --> 33:16.662
But maybe not the way
that you wanted, and I am sorry.

33:16.787 --> 33:18.079
Could you please not act
like a freak?

33:18.204 --> 33:19.706
Is that what you think of me?
A freak?

33:19.832 --> 33:22.000
Screw you, Dixon!

33:32.719 --> 33:34.471
ANNIE:
I guess we should get going, we
got a long drive ahead of us.

33:34.596 --> 33:38.057
Yeah, well, at least
the heat wave's over, right?

33:38.183 --> 33:41.102
Oh, my Lord,
my parents?

33:41.227 --> 33:43.730
Are here in Palm Springs?

33:43.856 --> 33:46.065
And they're
blocking us in.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.317
Uh...

33:47.442 --> 33:50.028
where... are they?

33:51.321 --> 33:52.572
Mom?

33:52.698 --> 33:54.366
Dad?

33:54.491 --> 33:56.284
Annie?

33:56.409 --> 33:57.327
Ethan.

33:57.452 --> 33:58.578
Oh!

33:58.704 --> 34:00.580
Mrs. Wilson.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.081
Principal Wilson.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.333
Uh...

34:03.458 --> 34:05.669
what are you doing here?

34:05.794 --> 34:08.087
I think that we could ask
you that very same question.

34:08.213 --> 34:09.297
But we won't.

34:11.632 --> 34:14.052
So, I think we all
have school today.

34:17.304 --> 34:18.514
Uh... then we
should get going.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.266
Right.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.476
Right.

34:21.601 --> 34:22.518
You guys drive safe.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.728
You, too.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.271
Okay.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.398
Bye.

34:29.650 --> 34:30.819
You don't think they...?

34:30.944 --> 34:33.572
I don't even want
to think about it.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.114
(giggles)

34:36.241 --> 34:37.617
Harry.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.793
Boo.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.755
Ade.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.130
Hi.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.175
It's nice and
cool in here.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.094
Yeah, thank goodness, huh?

34:58.304 --> 34:59.514
So, how did your walking go?

34:59.639 --> 35:01.683
Or is this a bad time?

35:01.808 --> 35:03.894
Do you need to walk some more?

35:04.019 --> 35:05.687
No, I'm good.
You know, I walked enough.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.397
I think.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.608
And...?

35:10.609 --> 35:13.820
Ade, um...

35:13.946 --> 35:16.406
I want to tell you
that I can do this,

35:16.531 --> 35:18.700
that I can handle this,
that I can deal with

35:18.825 --> 35:20.493
having a girlfriend...

35:20.619 --> 35:22.287
who is pregnant
by some other guy.

35:23.538 --> 35:26.374
Navid, I'm not really asking you
for anything.

35:26.499 --> 35:27.918
Good.

35:28.043 --> 35:32.756
Um... 'cause I-I don't
if I can do anything.

35:32.881 --> 35:35.592
Or be anything to you.

35:35.717 --> 35:38.845
I... I just really don't know
how to handle this.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.599
Okay.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.853
I'm really sorry, Ade.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.906
(crying)

36:04.496 --> 36:06.539
Hey.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.458
Hey.

36:08.583 --> 36:12.838
Listen... I'm sorry.

36:12.963 --> 36:14.422
It's all right,
it's cool.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.425
Yeah?

36:17.550 --> 36:18.969
Sure.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.387
We'll just pretend
it never happened.

36:21.513 --> 36:22.597
Okay.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.724
Sounds good.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.644
Uh... I better go.

36:27.769 --> 36:29.312
Okay.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.898
So, I'll see you later?

36:32.024 --> 36:34.526
Um... yeah, sure.

36:38.030 --> 36:40.365
Bye.

36:44.452 --> 36:47.205
(blender whirring loudly)

36:57.423 --> 36:58.842
(whirring stops)

36:58.967 --> 37:00.927
The kids can have the car.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.930
Really?

37:04.056 --> 37:05.807
It was very generous of you

37:05.932 --> 37:07.142
and it will come in handy.

37:07.266 --> 37:09.477
But they have to pay
for their own gas,

37:09.602 --> 37:10.645
and their own insurance.

37:10.770 --> 37:11.813
I'm putting my foot down
about that.

37:11.938 --> 37:13.773
I am sorry, you know?

37:13.899 --> 37:16.609
I crossed the line.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.696
It's hard to know when to get
involved and when to butt out.

37:19.821 --> 37:21.698
I want this to work.

37:21.823 --> 37:22.949
But we have to set
some ground rules.

37:23.075 --> 37:24.534
That sounds good.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.119
I work well with structure.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.329
But it'll have to wait
till I get back.

37:28.454 --> 37:29.539
From?

37:29.664 --> 37:30.832
Concord, Massachusetts.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.709
I got the miniseries.

37:32.834 --> 37:36.379
I'm Marmee Osgood in Red
Coats and Blue Bloods.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.173
Don't worry, Deb.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.967
My decision had nothing
to do with you.

37:41.093 --> 37:42.594
I need the work.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.221
I miss it.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.598
And I think you've got
everything under control here.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.350
Thanks, Tabitha.

37:49.475 --> 37:51.770
Ooh, and I'm glad you gave
the kids a car.

37:51.895 --> 37:55.065
Because after what you two
did in that minivan,

37:55.190 --> 37:56.315
I wouldn't want to drive it
either.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.743
So I owe you an apology.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.745
These rumors about you
being on drugs

38:08.870 --> 38:10.789
is the last thing
you need right now.

38:10.914 --> 38:12.582
Hey, it's not
your fault.

38:12.707 --> 38:16.419
Yeah, actually...
it is.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.339
I told the Blendeds
you were using again.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.842
It was before I knew
about... you know...

38:22.968 --> 38:24.886
and they told everyone.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.054
Why would you say that?

38:26.179 --> 38:27.513
Because that's
what I thought.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.682
I mean, I don't know,
I was angry.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.017
Before, when you were using,

38:31.143 --> 38:32.477
I really wanted
to help you.

38:32.602 --> 38:34.687
I reached out to you
and you really hurt me.

38:34.813 --> 38:39.109
You lied and...
you let me down.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.612
I know I did.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.530
And I'm sorry.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.783
So...

38:46.908 --> 38:49.619
where do we stand?

38:49.744 --> 38:52.831
Well, I'm 16...

38:52.956 --> 38:54.791
I'm having a baby,

38:54.916 --> 38:57.460
so that makes me a
walking statistic.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.045
And my boyfriend just
broke up with me...

38:59.171 --> 39:00.421
What?

39:00.546 --> 39:02.590
Yeah, that's
delightful.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.926
I'm all alone and I'm
going through this.

39:05.051 --> 39:07.095
You're not alone, Ade.

39:07.220 --> 39:10.182
Okay, I'm here,
I'm really here. Okay?

39:10.307 --> 39:12.684
And if you want
to have this baby,

39:12.809 --> 39:14.727
I'll go with you
to Lamaze class.

39:14.853 --> 39:17.022
Or if you don't want to have it,
I'll take you to the clinic.

39:17.147 --> 39:18.648
And if you can't decide,

39:18.773 --> 39:21.860
I'll sit with you
until you can.

39:21.985 --> 39:24.654
If you'll let me.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.740
Thanks.

39:27.866 --> 39:28.867
MS. GEISER:
Naomi, Adrianna,

39:28.992 --> 39:31.661
we're waiting!

39:31.786 --> 39:33.997
Lay off the 'roids,
you old freak-bag.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.832
(laughing)
Come on.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.712
Ethan?

39:44.049 --> 39:45.758
I need to talk to you.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.552
Uh, yeah, well, you
didn't have much to say

39:47.677 --> 39:50.805
in the car ride
home this morning.

39:58.230 --> 40:00.606
Last night...

40:00.732 --> 40:04.903
I wanted to be
with you so badly,

40:05.028 --> 40:09.115
but... I freaked out

40:09.241 --> 40:12.535
because it's not
just sex with you.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.037
It's something more.

40:14.162 --> 40:16.497
Hearing those things,
the emotions and stuff,

40:16.622 --> 40:18.833
that you attach to sex,

40:18.958 --> 40:23.004
it made me realize
that I feel the same way.

40:23.129 --> 40:26.049
And I want it, but I just
want to make sure

40:26.174 --> 40:29.594
that we have a strong...

40:29.719 --> 40:31.721
whatever, foundation
before we get there.

40:31.846 --> 40:35.474
So maybe we could slow
things down a little?

40:37.769 --> 40:41.022
And, um, how do you propose
we slow things down?

40:41.147 --> 40:45.902
Well, I propose a date.

40:46.027 --> 40:49.072
Just a typical, normal,
boring high school date.

40:49.197 --> 40:50.698
No liver,
no seven courses.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.951
Just a movie
and some making out.

40:53.076 --> 40:54.953
What do you say?

40:56.288 --> 40:58.998
I say yes.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.045
I love you, Annie Wilson.

41:04.170 --> 41:07.715
I love you, Ethan Ward.
