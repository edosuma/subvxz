00:01.000 --> 00:03.071
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:03.104 --> 00:05.373
Hey, got a spare bed
for a wanted fugitive?

00:05.405 --> 00:06.573
Hello, Faith.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.007
You've got
a rough sitch here.

00:08.041 --> 00:11.179
Trying to turn a bunch
of little girls into an army.

00:11.211 --> 00:14.515
They're potential Slayers,
just like we were.

00:14.548 --> 00:17.184
-Call me Caleb.
-I heard you have
something of mine.

00:17.217 --> 00:18.385
I do now.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.359
No!

00:25.393 --> 00:26.926
I work in mysterious ways.

00:30.763 --> 00:32.665
-(shouting)
-Xander!

00:32.700 --> 00:34.402
Look, I'm not saying
it's a happy scenario,

00:34.435 --> 00:37.170
but we're dealing
with a Big Bad that can be
any dead person it wants.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.838
At long last.

00:38.871 --> 00:40.841
A Slayer.

00:40.874 --> 00:44.911
We spent all this time
worrying about the Seal
and the Hellmouth.

00:44.945 --> 00:47.215
The bad guys always go
where the power is.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.549
They're protecting the vineyard
or something at the vineyard.

00:49.582 --> 00:52.219
And I say it's time we go in
and take it away from them.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.423
-How about we don't?
-This is a hell of a lot
to ask.

00:55.456 --> 00:58.792
And now what?
Suddenly you're all acting
like you can't trust me?

00:58.826 --> 01:03.430
We have to be together on this.
You can't be a part of it,
so I need you to leave.

01:03.463 --> 01:05.566
Look, I swear I didn't want it
to go this way.

01:05.599 --> 01:09.569
Don't. Whether you wanted it
or not, their lives are yours.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.974
"Power to the people"?
You sound like
a child of the '70s.

01:14.007 --> 01:18.111
-We're in charge of ourselves.
-Okay, guys. Let's try
not to freak out.

01:18.146 --> 01:20.480
All I'm saying is,
now that Buffy's not here,

01:20.513 --> 01:22.915
we finally have some say in how
and when we lose our necks.

01:22.950 --> 01:27.221
WOOD: Maybe you don't
have to be so blunt about
the "losing of the necks" bit.

01:27.254 --> 01:30.158
No, let the girl
speak the truth.
We're all on death's door,

01:30.191 --> 01:33.127
repeatedly ringing the doorbell
like maniacal Girl Scouts
trying to make quota.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.896
I'm thinkin'
that maybe everyone here
shouldn't have a say.

01:35.929 --> 01:40.268
W-We just have to find some way
of having constructive dialogue
without going completely mad.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.270
Do you know
the parliamentary procedure?

01:42.302 --> 01:44.337
'Cause that's a convenient way
of organizing--

01:44.371 --> 01:47.575
I just wonder if those of us
who have been here longer
should have more of a say.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.478
...also, this wouldn't be
so chaotic. Faith,
what do you think?

01:50.510 --> 01:52.445
When I was involved with
the Model U.N.,

01:52.479 --> 01:55.448
we found
the parliamentary procedure
to be a total lifesaver.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.985
She's gonna be fine.
Really, it's for the best.

01:59.019 --> 02:02.790
Yeah? Then why
do I feel like this?

02:02.822 --> 02:05.492
Only we had
this system which allowed us
to organize our conversation.

02:05.525 --> 02:08.762
-I hear what
you're saying, but--
-(all talking together)

02:08.794 --> 02:11.965
You guys, I think
we're wasting time,
arguing about how to argue.

02:11.998 --> 02:15.034
-Well, why don't we--
-Please do not mention
parliamentary procedure.

02:15.068 --> 02:18.372
-I second that.
-Everyone listen to me. Chill.

02:18.406 --> 02:22.210
All right, it's been
a long night, and I don't know
about you, but I'm wiped.

02:22.242 --> 02:25.378
Maybe we should catch
some sleep and figure
all this out in the morning.

02:25.413 --> 02:29.349
-Do we have time to waste?
-Look. I understand you guys
are wicked stressed.

02:29.383 --> 02:32.719
Frankly, our situation blows.

02:32.752 --> 02:35.522
We've gotta stay cool.
It's the only way we're gonna
get through this.

02:35.555 --> 02:39.326
-Can everyone handle that?
-(girls agreeing)

02:39.360 --> 02:42.162
We'll get some rest, and then
tomorrow, things won't seem so--

02:42.195 --> 02:45.064
-(gasping, shrieking)
-What's happening?

02:45.098 --> 02:47.134
AMANDA:
I'll get some candles,
if we have candles.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.203
KENNEDY:
I'll check the fuse box.
Don't bother.

02:49.236 --> 02:51.639
All the lights in
the whole street just went out.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.706
-Which means?
-The people from
the power company

02:53.740 --> 02:55.376
have got the hell
out of Sunnydale.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.378
VI:
I think I'm freaking out.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.080
Okay. I'm gonna get
a flashlight.

03:28.442 --> 03:32.280
Don't move.
Get out of my house.

03:32.312 --> 03:35.716
Hey. (sighs)
I thought the place
would be empty.

03:35.748 --> 03:38.352
I was looking
for a place to crash.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.454
You know,
you really should leave.

03:40.487 --> 03:45.393
-You can't just kick me out
of my own house.
-Why not?

03:45.425 --> 03:47.795
It's what all the cool kids
are doing nowadays.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.564
It's not your house.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.834
It's not your town.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.670
Not anymore.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.117
Got any Tab?

04:13.820 --> 04:16.255
(theme music playing)

05:10.310 --> 05:11.579
(sighing)

05:14.081 --> 05:18.386
I spy with my little eye
something that begins
with a "T".

05:18.418 --> 05:20.721
-Tapestry.
-Hey! Good one. How did you--

05:20.754 --> 05:23.891
Tapestry is the only thing
in the whole bloody room.

05:23.923 --> 05:27.528
Ah. So say you, but I say,
look deeper.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.629
I'll look deep into your jugular
is what I'll look at.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.365
Don't spazz out!
I'm not--

05:33.567 --> 05:35.034
Don't say another word.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.677
Rock, paper, scissors?

05:43.711 --> 05:47.715
What's the matter with you?
Don't you understand
what's happening?

05:47.747 --> 05:50.216
Uh, yeah, we're waiting here
'til it's night again,

05:50.250 --> 05:53.052
so you can ride on your
motorcycle without exploding.

05:53.086 --> 05:56.322
And every minute we're stuck
here, the Slayer's out there
facing hell knows what.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.992
Come on. What's the worst thing
that could happen to her?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.860
(growling)

06:02.795 --> 06:04.997
All right!
So, what do we know?

06:05.031 --> 06:08.367
Well, we know we're
basically the last humans
left in Sunnydale.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.771
And that all the evil
in town wants us dead.

06:10.803 --> 06:13.105
-I don't want to die.
-Don't worry.

06:13.139 --> 06:17.076
It's far more likely you'll live
long enough to watch most of
your friends die first.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.346
And then you'll die.
We also know

06:19.379 --> 06:22.348
that Caleb told Buffy that
everything's going down
at the Seal.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.584
-I think we should head--
-Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

06:24.617 --> 06:28.422
So, we know we've got a lot
of enemies. We'll start there.

06:28.456 --> 06:31.692
-Faith, I'm sorry--
-I got this, okay?

06:31.725 --> 06:34.528
So, let's go over
our rogue's gallery.
Who exactly do we have here?

06:34.562 --> 06:37.697
Well, there's The First,
who we can't touch.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.067
And there's our friend,
the Reverend "I Hate Women."

06:40.100 --> 06:42.970
-ANYA:
Who's basically untouchable.
-There's the 'roid-rage vamps,

06:43.002 --> 06:45.204
who are pretty much the worst--
and the, uh--

06:45.237 --> 06:48.475
Bringers! I think
they're our weakest link.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.911
Are you thinking of
attacking the Bringers?
 Maybe or--

06:50.944 --> 06:54.648
-Okay, we could kidnap one.
-(scoffs) And what?
Hold it ransom?

06:54.682 --> 06:57.317
Yeah, I'll get the magazines
and start ripping out
the letters now.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.220
"Dear Mr. First,
If you want your Bringer back,

07:00.252 --> 07:03.591
"well, we'll be surprised,
because you've got, like,
three million of them.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.925
So please disregard this letter.
Yours Sincerely--"

07:05.959 --> 07:08.562
I'm saying, think about
getting us a Bringer
and making it talk.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.298
Find out info on The First
and Caleb that way.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.399
How do you think we should
catch one if they don't
want to be found?

07:13.432 --> 07:15.903
Okay. I'm not sure
this is such a good idea.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.805
Why try and get information when
we already know about the Seal?

07:18.838 --> 07:21.074
Why don't we send
a team to the high school,
do some recon, and--

07:21.108 --> 07:24.343
-No.
-Just like that?

07:24.377 --> 07:29.281
-You're not even listening.
-Sweetie, you're pushing
too hard.

07:29.315 --> 07:32.284
I thought things would
be different now, but
you keep shutting me down.

07:32.319 --> 07:35.322
Things are different,
because now...

07:35.355 --> 07:37.456
I'm your boss.

07:37.490 --> 07:41.862
Look, you guys, I'm not Buffy.
I'm not the one who's been
on your asses all this time.

07:41.894 --> 07:44.632
But I'm not one of you
anymore either.

07:44.665 --> 07:48.334
I'm your leader,
which means I go first,
and I make the rules,

07:48.367 --> 07:51.939
and the rest of you
follow after me--
is that clear?

07:51.971 --> 07:55.141
So, Kennedy, back the hell off
and let me do my job, all right?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.846
Okay.
Let's get down to business.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.819
I was hoping you'd bring me
some better news.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.754
And I wish I had some.

08:10.356 --> 08:14.161
Is this gonna do anything?
Or is all this just to make
the Bringers sweat?

08:14.194 --> 08:18.331
Do the Bringers sweat?
Actually,
I think they pant.

08:18.365 --> 08:21.869
Like dogs. And I don't know
if this is gonna do any good,

08:21.901 --> 08:24.637
-but we have to try everything.
-You realize
what will happen...

08:24.672 --> 08:26.740
if the Slayer and
her girls get it, don't you?

08:26.774 --> 08:31.343
They won't.
That's right. They won't.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.881
Because you're going
to kill all of them.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.716
And everyone they know.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.553
Hallelujah.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.244
I've never been
the bait before.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.649
That was, uh, actually
kind of scary.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.150
We had your back.
You did well.

09:44.183 --> 09:47.453
Your performance as
a disgruntled minion
was spot-on.

09:47.486 --> 09:49.489
I'm Method.
(pants)

09:49.522 --> 09:51.524
Let's get this back
to the captain.

10:02.669 --> 10:04.937
Oh, hey. So?

10:06.105 --> 10:08.508
Ah, the Bringer's dumb.
Oh.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.576
You were expecting what,
a Rhodes Scholar?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.813
-Dumb as in "mute."
-Someone ripped out its tongue.

10:13.846 --> 10:17.083
-Oh, gross!
-Hey.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.986
I-I've been reading this
old Turkish spell book.

10:20.019 --> 10:24.124
There's an old conjuration
that the ancient Turks used
to communicate with the dying.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.927
Oh, yeah. I think
I've read a translation
of that.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.697
There's a translation of it?

10:29.730 --> 10:32.099
(sighs)
I'm over it.

10:32.131 --> 10:35.802
Um, so this spell
is used to communicate
with people who can't talk.

10:35.836 --> 10:40.173
Um, like, if a person was dying,
this spell would let them

10:40.206 --> 10:43.210
say their good-byes,
or, you know, gripe about
how nobody came to visit them.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.279
Would this help us
with Mr. No-Tongue?

10:47.313 --> 10:50.116
Yeah. I think so.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.952
I-I just need to get together
a few ingredients and--

10:52.985 --> 10:56.355
All right. Well, cool.
While Willow does that,
the rest of us can--

10:56.389 --> 10:59.491
-ANDREW: We're back!
-GILES: Spike.

10:59.525 --> 11:03.296
-Hey.
-Hi, everybody.
I missed you guys a lot.

11:03.330 --> 11:08.668
Sorry it took so long to get
back from our mission mission,
but we had to wait out the sun--

11:08.701 --> 11:12.504
Well, I think our--
our mission went very well.

11:12.538 --> 11:15.875
We, uh--
We rode on Spike's hog,
which was very cool,

11:15.908 --> 11:18.544
and played some amusing games.

11:18.577 --> 11:21.181
And uh--Oh!
We got some information--

11:21.213 --> 11:23.783
You know what?
I really need to urinate.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.688
He's a breath of fresh air,
isn't he? (sighs)

11:29.722 --> 11:33.692
Thank God I don't breathe.
So. I think we got a lead.

11:33.726 --> 11:38.697
-Where's Buffy?
-Um, she's not here right now.

11:38.731 --> 11:40.600
When does she get back?

11:40.633 --> 11:42.870
Uh...

11:42.903 --> 11:47.039
While you were gone,
we all got together and...

11:47.073 --> 11:51.879
uh, talked out
some disagreements
that we were having.

11:51.912 --> 11:56.082
A-And eventually,
after much discussion,

11:56.115 --> 11:59.219
Buffy decided that
it would be best
for all of us...

11:59.251 --> 12:02.422
if she... took
a little time off.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.456
A little breather.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.092
Uh-huh.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.597
I see. Been practicing
that little speech long,
have you?

12:14.067 --> 12:18.538
So, uh, Buffy took
some time off right in
the middle of the apocalypse,

12:18.571 --> 12:21.707
-and it was her decision.
-Well, we all decided.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.176
Oh, yeah.
 You all decided.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.645
(scoffs, chuckles)

12:27.780 --> 12:31.484
You sad, sad,
ungrateful traitors.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.586
-Who do you think you are?
-We're her friends.
We just wanted--

12:34.620 --> 12:38.225
Oh, that's ballsy of you!
You're her friends
and you betray her like this.

12:38.258 --> 12:42.962
-Uh, you don't understand.
-You know, I think I do.
Rupert.

12:42.995 --> 12:45.932
You used to be
the big man, didn't you?

12:45.966 --> 12:48.500
The teacher, all full of wisdom.

12:48.534 --> 12:52.471
Now she's surpassed you,
and you can't handle it.

12:52.504 --> 12:55.475
She has saved your lives
again and again.

12:56.775 --> 12:59.245
She has died for you,
and this is how you thank her.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.648
Hey! Why don't you
take it down a notch or two?

13:01.681 --> 13:05.118
The time for speech-giving
is over, bad boy.

13:05.152 --> 13:08.187
Oh! Is that right?

13:08.221 --> 13:11.191
Yeah, that's right.
Save your lack of breath.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.792
All right.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.298
You're pretty sweet
on her, aren't you?

13:19.698 --> 13:24.504
I think it's cute...
the way she's got you whipped.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.706
Enough!

13:34.480 --> 13:36.682
(panting)
Finally got what you wanted,
didn't you?

13:39.919 --> 13:41.889
-Where is she?
-I don't know!

13:57.904 --> 13:59.940
(sighs)

14:09.682 --> 14:13.019
(chanting in Turkish)

14:16.389 --> 14:17.789
Speak to us.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.495
Maybe I should
rough him up a little.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.596
Andrew!
Be quiet!

14:24.630 --> 14:26.666
I don't know, guys.
That should have worked.

14:26.698 --> 14:28.600
ANDREW:
I am a drone in the mind
that is evil.

14:28.634 --> 14:31.104
Could you just shut up?

14:31.138 --> 14:34.441
I say I'm part of
the great darkness.
Somebody needs a reality check.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.743
Or a muzzle.
Wait.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.745
ANDREW:
I'm only a fragment of the "we".

14:39.778 --> 14:42.081
We work as one
to serve The First.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.787
Okay. What do you--
the "we"--do for The First?

14:49.088 --> 14:51.091
We work to prepare
for the inevitable battle.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.895
How? Tell me exactly
what the Bringers are doing.

14:56.929 --> 14:59.532
Kennedy, he can't see
the knife.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.400
We can feel the knife.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.169
Kennedy.

15:06.438 --> 15:08.807
We tend to the needs
of the infinite evil.

15:08.841 --> 15:12.144
We exterminate girls
and destroy the legacy
of the Slayer.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.816
We build an arsenal
beneath the dirt.

15:16.849 --> 15:19.251
We obey the commands
of our teacher, Caleb.

15:19.286 --> 15:22.389
Wait. Could we go back
to the dirt thing?

15:22.422 --> 15:25.892
We build weapons
to prepare for the coming war.

15:25.924 --> 15:28.727
At the farthest edge of town.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.864
We are everywhere.
We are like the ocean's waves.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.601
We watch your efforts
and are not scared.

15:35.634 --> 15:38.205
We will laugh at you
as you die.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.575
Hold the bananas!

15:42.609 --> 15:47.014
You are so lucky
that you did not just
magically decapitate me.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.515
We've got enough here.
We need to get Faith
in on this.

15:49.548 --> 15:52.684
Xander, gather some maps.
We need to find a subterranean
space large enough

15:52.719 --> 15:56.788
to house an armory.
I feel used and violated and...
I need a lozenge.

16:02.461 --> 16:05.097
(knocking)

16:05.131 --> 16:07.167
(knocking continues)

16:09.068 --> 16:11.471
(door opening)

16:11.504 --> 16:13.240
(sighs)
There you are.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.942
Do you realize I could
just walk in here?

16:16.975 --> 16:19.011
No invite needed?

16:19.046 --> 16:21.347
(scoffs)
This town really is
theirs now, isn't it?

16:22.881 --> 16:25.052
I heard.
I was over there.

16:25.085 --> 16:28.520
That bitch!
(sighs)

16:28.554 --> 16:31.857
She all about smiles
and reformation when
you're on your feet.

16:31.890 --> 16:34.494
But the moment you're down,
she's all about the kicking.
Isn't that right?

16:34.527 --> 16:37.496
Makes me want--
It wasn't just Faith.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.033
It was all of them.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.504
And it's not like
they were wrong.

16:46.673 --> 16:50.342
-Please leave.
-No.

16:50.376 --> 16:53.480
This'll change your tune.
I came here, 'cause I've got
something to tell you.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.149
You were right.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.684
Caleb is trying to
protect something from you.

16:58.717 --> 17:01.488
And I think you were
spot-on all the way.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.757
I think it's
at the vineyard. So?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.826
You were right.

17:07.858 --> 17:10.130
Buffy?

17:11.198 --> 17:13.400
I don't feel very right.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.569
You're not foolin' me.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.775
-What do you even mean?
-Well, you're not a quitter.

17:22.808 --> 17:26.746
-Watch me.
-You were their leader.

17:26.778 --> 17:29.449
And you still are.

17:29.481 --> 17:31.983
This isn't
something you gave up.
It's something they took.

17:34.253 --> 17:38.758
-And the difference is?
-We can take it back.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.926
Sewer tunnel on
the north side's closest,

17:40.960 --> 17:43.262
so I guess we'll start there.

17:43.296 --> 17:46.365
Sounds fine.
What time shall
I tell everyone?

17:46.398 --> 17:48.434
How about... around 7:00?

17:50.068 --> 17:51.238
7:00 sharp.

17:52.771 --> 17:54.773
So, tomorrow we fight.

17:55.907 --> 17:58.911
Tomorrow.
Good night, Faith.
Faith.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.848
-Yeah?
-You're doing just fine.

18:08.121 --> 18:11.423
I'd say better than fine.
I'd say you're doing
a bang-up job.

18:12.592 --> 18:16.895
-Get out.
-(chuckles) Well, gosh.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.799
I think, you know, a "Hello,"
or a "Nice to see you," might be
a little more welcome.

18:20.833 --> 18:24.304
It's the end of humanity,
Faith, not the end of courtesy.

18:24.336 --> 18:28.141
You're wasting your time.
I know who you are.
What you are.

18:28.174 --> 18:30.710
Yeah, yeah--
Nobody's explained to you
how this works, have they?

18:31.810 --> 18:35.013
You see, I am
part of The First,

18:35.047 --> 18:38.116
as you kids call it,
but I'm also... me:

18:38.151 --> 18:42.189
Richard Wilkins III,
late mayor and founder
of Sunnydale.

18:42.221 --> 18:45.758
Here, I'll prove it to you.
Ask me a question only
I know the answer to.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.027
Something like--
(laughs)

18:48.059 --> 18:51.431
"Where did I hide the moon pies
in my office?"

18:51.463 --> 18:54.467
Or, "Who was my favorite
character in Little Women?"

18:56.302 --> 18:58.770
Meg.
(laughs)

18:58.805 --> 19:03.375
I know! I know! Most people
guess Beth, but Meg, she's
such a proper young lady.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.978
Remember when
Jo burned her hair?
I know what you're doing.

19:06.011 --> 19:08.381
And it's not gonna work.
But feel free to keep talkin'.

19:08.414 --> 19:11.284
'Cause, hell, I could
listen to you yap all night.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

19:11.317 --> 19:13.519
Language!
You're a leader now.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.821
You keep throwin' the
"H-E-double-hockey-sticks"
around,

19:15.855 --> 19:18.458
pretty soon the girls
are gonna pick up on it,
then what?

19:18.490 --> 19:20.792
You let me worry
about the girls.
Of course, of course.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.563
You're doin' a great job
with 'em, by the way. Much
better than Buffy ever did.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.833
-You were smart to kick her out.
-That's not what we--

19:26.865 --> 19:29.736
Buffy got 'em this far.
Why are you protecting her?

19:29.769 --> 19:33.205
You think she cares about you?
She nearly killed you, Faith.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.673
It's different now.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.009
No matter what you do,

19:39.077 --> 19:41.748
Buffy will always
see you as a killer.

19:41.780 --> 19:45.917
Not as a person.
And now you have what
she so desperately wants.

19:45.951 --> 19:50.021
The respect of these girls.
All she needs is an excuse,

19:50.056 --> 19:53.593
and she'll finish what
she started when she stuck
that knife in your belly.

19:53.625 --> 19:57.063
You stay on guard, Faith.
Buffy's dangerous.

19:57.096 --> 20:00.267
If you're not careful,
she'll destroy you.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.636
I'm just sayin'!

20:13.313 --> 20:15.548
SPIKE: No?
No.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.584
You mean no as in,
"eventually"?

20:17.616 --> 20:19.586
You really have problems
with that word, don't you?

20:19.618 --> 20:23.756
You can get them back!
Can? Maybe.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.959
Should?
(sniffles)

20:26.992 --> 20:28.760
I'm just so tired.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.330
They need you!

20:33.266 --> 20:36.603
Well, I--
It's bloody chaos
over there without you!

20:38.637 --> 20:41.106
It is?
Yeah! Yeah.

20:41.140 --> 20:44.210
It's, uh--
There's junk.

20:44.242 --> 20:47.314
You know, food cartons.
Sleeping bags not rolled up.

20:47.346 --> 20:51.150
Everyone's very scared
and, uh, unkempt.

20:51.182 --> 20:54.354
Sounds dire.
I didn't see a lot.

20:56.087 --> 20:58.924
I came, hit Faith
a bunch of times, and left.

21:00.292 --> 21:03.563
Really? I mean,
not that I'm glad, but--

21:03.596 --> 21:05.597
Oh, you say the word, and
she's a footnote in history.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.599
I'll make it look like
a painful accident.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.501
That's my problem.

21:11.202 --> 21:14.773
I say the word,
some girl dies.

21:16.041 --> 21:18.176
Every time.
(sighs)

21:18.210 --> 21:19.945
There's always
casualties in war.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.214
Casualties in...

21:24.651 --> 21:27.153
It just sounds so...
casual.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.423
These are... girls

21:31.458 --> 21:33.526
that I got killed.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.262
I cut myself off from them.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.664
All of them.

21:40.700 --> 21:43.201
I knew I was gonna
lose some of them, and...

21:43.234 --> 21:45.771
I didn't--
(sighs)

21:45.805 --> 21:50.142
You know what?
I'm still making excuses.

21:50.175 --> 21:52.278
I've always cut myself off.

21:52.310 --> 21:54.246
I've always--
(sighs)

21:56.415 --> 21:59.050
Being the Slayer
made me different.

22:01.319 --> 22:04.824
But it's my fault
I stayed that way.

22:06.092 --> 22:08.760
People are always trying
to connect to me.

22:10.229 --> 22:13.365
And I just...
slip away.

22:14.601 --> 22:17.403
(scoffs)
You should know.

22:17.436 --> 22:21.207
I seem to recall a certain
amount of connecting.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.510
Oh, please.
We were never close.

22:24.544 --> 22:27.179
You just wanted me
because I was...
unattainable.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.849
You think that's
all that was?

22:30.883 --> 22:32.751
Please, let's not
go over the past.
Oh, no, no!

22:32.785 --> 22:35.020
Oh, let's hold on here!
(sighs)

22:35.054 --> 22:37.088
I've hummed along
to your pity ditty,

22:37.123 --> 22:39.459
-and I think I should have
the mike for a bit.
-Fine.

22:40.727 --> 22:43.028
The stage is yours.
Cheer me up.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.432
You're insufferable.

22:46.465 --> 22:49.568
Thank you.
That really helped.
I'm not tryin' to cheer you up.

22:49.602 --> 22:53.038
What are you trying to say?
I don't know!

22:53.072 --> 22:57.209
I'll know when I'm done
sayin' it. Something
pissed me off, and I just--

22:58.478 --> 23:01.948
"Unattainable," that's it.
Fine.

23:01.980 --> 23:04.584
I'm attainable. I'm a--
I'm an "attain-a-thon."

23:04.616 --> 23:06.618
May I please just go to sleep?

23:07.886 --> 23:09.221
You listen to me.

23:12.258 --> 23:14.861
I've been alive
a bit longer than you.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.462
And dead a lot
longer than that.

23:18.329 --> 23:20.666
I've seen things
you couldn't imagine.

23:22.233 --> 23:23.736
And done things
I prefer you didn't.

23:25.070 --> 23:28.740
Don't exactly have a reputation
for being a thinker.

23:28.775 --> 23:32.545
(inhales deeply)
I follow my blood,

23:32.578 --> 23:35.013
which doesn't exactly
rush in the direction
of my brain.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.550
So I make
a lot of mistakes.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.419
A lot of wrong
bloody calls.

23:41.453 --> 23:42.989
100-plus years.

23:44.523 --> 23:47.326
And there's only one thing
I've ever been sure of.

23:47.358 --> 23:48.961
You.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.501
Hey, look at me.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.869
I'm not asking you
for anything.

24:00.138 --> 24:02.441
When I say I love you,
it's not because I want you.

24:02.474 --> 24:04.844
Or because
I can't have you.

24:04.876 --> 24:06.679
It has nothing
to do with me.

24:08.047 --> 24:11.983
I love what you are.
What you do.

24:13.384 --> 24:15.054
How you try.

24:17.222 --> 24:19.625
I've seen your kindness,
and your strength.

24:19.659 --> 24:22.994
I've seen the best
and the worst of you.

24:23.028 --> 24:26.065
And I understand,
with perfect clarity,
exactly what you are.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.402
You're a hell of a woman.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.240
You're the One, Buffy.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.477
I don't want to be the One.

24:41.079 --> 24:43.449
I don't want to be this
good-looking and athletic.

24:43.481 --> 24:46.752
-We all have crosses to bear.
-(chuckles)

24:50.489 --> 24:52.659
You get some rest now.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.627
I'll check in
before first light.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.630
You can decide
how you want.

24:57.663 --> 24:58.765
Spike.

25:01.768 --> 25:04.069
Could you... stay here?

25:05.104 --> 25:06.505
Sure.

25:09.576 --> 25:13.511
(sighs) That diabolical old
torture device, the comfy chair.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.648
-It'll do me fine.
-No.

25:16.682 --> 25:19.951
I mean... here.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.523
Will you just hold me?

25:45.411 --> 25:49.280
Deep down, you always wanted
Buffy to accept you.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.683
To love you, even.
Why do you think that is?

25:51.718 --> 25:54.220
You a shrink now?
You keep looking for love

25:54.252 --> 25:57.856
and acceptance
from these people,
these friends of yours.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.858
But you're
never gonna find it.
The truth is,

25:59.892 --> 26:01.559
nobody will ever love you.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.797
-Not the way I love you.
-Get out.

26:04.830 --> 26:08.233
-They'll forever see you
as a killer.
-I said, get out.

26:08.267 --> 26:12.104
I'll always be
with you, firecracker.
In everything you do.

26:14.606 --> 26:16.742
Faith?
You shouldn't
sneak up like that.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.945
-I almost took your head off.
-Sorry. I knocked.

26:19.979 --> 26:24.884
-What'd you see?
-Just... you looking spooked.
What happened?

26:24.916 --> 26:26.786
Are you sure
you're all right?
What?

26:26.818 --> 26:29.055
You wanna rap
about my problems now?

26:29.087 --> 26:32.157
Are you looking to be
the guy who puts the "pal"
in "principal" for me?

26:32.191 --> 26:35.728
Okay. You know what?
I came up here to talk
to you about weapons.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.964
(sighs) I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm just--

26:38.998 --> 26:42.334
Listen, I'm gonna
leave you alone. I didn't
mean to intrude.

26:42.367 --> 26:43.869
It was The First.

26:57.148 --> 26:59.786
Well, you're really
in the game now, Faith.

26:59.818 --> 27:02.253
The First doesn't
show itself unless
it thinks you matter.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.323
Lucky me. I'm a player.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.292
Man, look at that.
My hand's shakin'!

27:07.326 --> 27:10.296
Demons, vampires, women
in the penitentiary system--

27:10.395 --> 27:13.865
-none of that freaks me out!
-That's exactly
what The First does.

27:13.900 --> 27:18.170
-Find your Achilles' heel.
-No, it just talked to me.
It does a heal thing too?

27:19.171 --> 27:22.141
Um, it's, um--
It's a phrase.

27:22.173 --> 27:24.276
Your weak spot.
Oh.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.644
A school thing.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.547
I was kinda absent that decade.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.920
(sighs)
So, who was it?

27:34.921 --> 27:35.988
The First.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.960
He was like
an old boss of mine.

27:40.992 --> 27:44.096
Just a boss?
And he's got you
shakin' like this?

27:45.163 --> 27:46.965
Wouldn't give you
a raise, huh?

27:46.999 --> 27:49.335
Yeah, right?
(chuckles)

27:49.367 --> 27:53.905
No, it sounds retarded,
but he was like a dad to me.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.540
Oh.

27:58.376 --> 28:00.880
It was my mother
when it came to me.

28:00.913 --> 28:04.115
And I mean, it was her,
right down to the perfume.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.287
Sorry.
Yeah.

28:09.855 --> 28:12.759
I'm so pissed off at myself.
I knew it was a trick.

28:12.791 --> 28:16.127
So did I. But I still
wanted my mother to hold me
like a little baby.

28:17.462 --> 28:20.332
In a manly way,
of course.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.700
Of course.

28:23.402 --> 28:26.372
Listen, nobody wants
to be alone, Faith.

28:26.404 --> 28:30.041
We all want someone who cares,
to be touched that way.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.744
I mean, The First
deals in figments.

28:32.778 --> 28:35.914
But that wanting is real.

28:35.948 --> 28:40.519
Hittin' things, and...
(chuckles) a whole lot
of Jack "D" dulls it some.

28:40.551 --> 28:41.788
Among other things.

28:45.825 --> 28:48.359
When it came to you,
did The First tell the truth?

28:48.394 --> 28:51.029
-Yeah.
-It said to watch out
for Buffy.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.699
-That Buffy's dangerous.
-And what do you think?

28:53.731 --> 28:58.670
Could be. I mean,
we've given her pretty good
reason to be pissed off.

28:59.838 --> 29:02.040
You know, the messed-up thing,

29:02.074 --> 29:05.376
The First is tellin' me
to worry about her, and
I just wish she was here.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.946
In a couple of hours,
I'm gonna lead these girls
into some serious crap.

29:07.980 --> 29:11.116
-And she's the only one--
-She's not the only one.

29:11.150 --> 29:14.252
You're a Slayer too, Faith.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.454
And I think
you're a good leader.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.557
I'm an ex-con who didn't
finish high school.

29:18.589 --> 29:22.060
Yeah. Well,
I'm the principal of a school
where nobody finished.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.462
And I am completely
out of my league in this.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.265
Oh. I hear otherwise.

29:31.002 --> 29:33.704
So, um--

29:35.606 --> 29:37.375
Tomorrow, then?
Forget about tomorrow.

29:39.010 --> 29:40.145
This is tonight.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.916
Been a while.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.052
Am I out of line?

29:48.119 --> 29:49.955
Hey. You're the leader.

30:06.238 --> 30:10.476
Okay, guys. Giles said
Faith wants us to start
early in the morning, so--

30:12.144 --> 30:14.779
What happened to the girls?

30:14.813 --> 30:18.150
-Looks like there's
only one girl here.
-What about the other ones?

30:18.183 --> 30:21.854
With their sleeping bags,
and their headgear
and their snoring--

30:21.887 --> 30:24.323
They're not here, are they?

30:24.355 --> 30:25.857
Nope.

30:26.992 --> 30:30.395
(chuckles)
Well, that's nice.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.566
Hmm? Nice?

30:35.701 --> 30:38.170
Mm.
And necessary.

30:41.106 --> 30:43.108
Come here, you.

30:52.919 --> 30:57.355
Foreplay was threatening
to turn into "twelve-play."

31:05.431 --> 31:06.798
Something not right?

31:08.366 --> 31:09.401
No.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.270
No, I just, uh...

31:14.405 --> 31:16.508
I guess I'm a little scared.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.876
It's probably stupid
to ask why, huh?

31:19.877 --> 31:21.913
Death, war, apocalypse.

31:21.948 --> 31:22.881
Me.

31:24.615 --> 31:29.055
(sighs)
I'm just scared
that if we--

31:30.155 --> 31:31.289
then I'll--

31:32.790 --> 31:35.126
and then--
And then?

31:35.161 --> 31:38.297
(chuckles)
Isn't that the good part?

31:40.132 --> 31:43.634
Good? Yeah, good.
Good feeling.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.204
Mm-hmm.
But also--

31:46.238 --> 31:48.374
Bad stuff? Like,

31:48.406 --> 31:52.743
unrestrained moaning
and screaming with joy?

31:54.346 --> 31:57.115
Well, sort of.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.486
The unrestrained part.

32:00.519 --> 32:04.722
But I've just-- I've kind of
been in a space where I--

32:04.756 --> 32:06.092
I should be restrained.

32:07.358 --> 32:10.395
I've been controlling
myself, and I--

32:10.429 --> 32:12.097
if I lose
that control...

32:13.298 --> 32:14.967
and let myself go, I--

32:16.268 --> 32:19.938
I could just go.
Hmm.

32:19.971 --> 32:22.374
You're worried you're gonna
turn into big, bad Willow?

32:23.608 --> 32:25.344
It's not stupid.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.213
When we first kissed, I...

32:29.381 --> 32:32.151
turned into... Warren.

32:32.183 --> 32:36.788
It's not stupid.
But it's not gonna happen.

32:38.656 --> 32:40.992
I just want you to know
that you're safe with me.

32:41.027 --> 32:43.162
Yeah?

32:43.194 --> 32:45.864
You can float around,
and I'll tether you down.

32:48.166 --> 32:51.202
You'll be like...
my kite string.

32:51.237 --> 32:54.472
Mm-hmm.
You be a kite,

32:55.507 --> 32:59.010
and I'll be
your kite string, okay?

33:00.645 --> 33:02.213
Okay.
Okay.

33:04.715 --> 33:06.585
Mm. Come here.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.656
(bed creaking)
They could show
a little respect, you know?

33:11.690 --> 33:14.992
Mm.
I mean...

33:15.027 --> 33:17.363
they should at least acknowledge
the fact that some people...

33:17.395 --> 33:19.830
might not want to listen to
an a cappella concert...

33:19.865 --> 33:21.967
of people, you know--
(laughing, whispering)

33:22.000 --> 33:23.868
moaning and groaning.
Mm.

33:25.570 --> 33:28.539
It's disgusting, is what it is.
A little jealous, huh?

33:28.574 --> 33:30.576
Of course I am.
I'm a lot jealous.

33:30.608 --> 33:33.311
I mean, if we're done
having sex, then...
(inhales)

33:33.345 --> 33:36.781
I think other people
should just knock it off.
(bed squeaking)

33:47.692 --> 33:52.897
* I used to think that
I knew what we needed *

33:52.931 --> 33:57.903
* Just assumed
we would always be fine *

33:57.935 --> 34:01.740
* Now I don't think
that we lost the feeling *

34:01.772 --> 34:06.778
* But we let everything
build up inside *

34:06.811 --> 34:09.614
* It's only love

34:09.648 --> 34:12.784
* But love

34:12.818 --> 34:17.054
* Should make us strong

34:17.088 --> 34:19.891
* It's only love

34:19.925 --> 34:23.295
* But love

34:23.329 --> 34:25.896
* Has been

34:25.931 --> 34:28.367
* Hurting for so

34:28.400 --> 34:32.371
* Long

34:32.402 --> 34:35.574
* And it's so hard if you

34:35.606 --> 34:37.576
* Tear them apart

34:37.608 --> 34:42.780
* Only love

34:42.813 --> 34:45.951
* And its alternative

34:45.983 --> 34:48.987
* Hopin' to learn only

34:49.018 --> 34:51.289
* Love

34:51.322 --> 34:53.324
FIRST/BUFFY: I envy them.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.262
Isn't that the strangest thing?

34:58.797 --> 35:01.432
CALEB:
Well, it does throw me a tad.

35:01.467 --> 35:06.103
I mean, they're just--
Well, they're barely
more than animals.

35:06.137 --> 35:08.306
Feedin' off
each other's flesh.
It's nauseatin'.

35:09.474 --> 35:10.641
But you?

35:11.677 --> 35:13.211
(scoffs)
You're everywhere.

35:14.713 --> 35:17.382
You're in the hearts
of little children.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.188
You're in the souls
of the rich.

35:22.221 --> 35:26.291
You're the fire that makes
people kill and hate.

35:26.324 --> 35:28.226
The fire that will cure
the world of weakness.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.528
They're just sinners.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.063
You are sin.

35:34.965 --> 35:37.603
I do enjoy your sermons.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.505
And you're in me.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.940
Gave me strength
no man can have.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.043
You're the only man strong
enough to be my vessel.

35:46.512 --> 35:48.514
And I know you feel me,
but...

35:50.981 --> 35:52.650
I know why they
grab at each other.

35:53.684 --> 35:55.353
To feel.

35:57.222 --> 35:58.556
I wanna feel.

36:00.559 --> 36:04.396
I want to wrap my hands
around some innocent neck
and feel it crack.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.699
Amen.

36:30.956 --> 36:35.693
So, it turned out that
all these stone tablets
basically said the same thing.

36:35.726 --> 36:37.663
The First and Caleb
are protecting something,

36:37.695 --> 36:40.097
and-and we don't know
exactly what it is,

36:40.130 --> 36:44.670
but it's-it's something
powerful, and they don't want
the Slayers to get it.

36:44.702 --> 36:48.873
I'm thinking it could
be a weapon, and if we're
looking for an arsenal--

36:48.907 --> 36:54.045
-You're not coming.
-If one is looking for
an arsenal,

36:54.079 --> 36:56.715
what better place
to find a--
weapon.

36:56.748 --> 37:01.052
Okay. Got it.
Good. Good thinking,
Andrew.

37:01.085 --> 37:03.954
It's a pleasure, Faith.
Back to you.
Okay.

37:03.989 --> 37:06.625
I need you four to suss out
the situation on B.

37:06.657 --> 37:09.126
I don't want you talkin'
to her, or getting in her way.

37:09.159 --> 37:12.431
Or for that matter,
letting her know you're there.
Just do a little recon.

37:12.463 --> 37:14.365
And where do
you want me, Faith?
By your phone.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.603
-I'll call you when I need you.
-What are we looking for?

37:17.635 --> 37:20.639
I mean, is there some reason
we should spy on Buffy?

37:20.672 --> 37:23.909
We're just makin' sure
she's okay.

37:23.942 --> 37:27.211
Those of you who are coming
with me to the arsenal,
you know who you are.

37:27.244 --> 37:30.449
Everybody ready?
Let's do this thing.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.467
CALEB:
Shouldn't be long now.

37:50.835 --> 37:53.739
Prophecies say one thing.
Brute strength says another.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.742
We'll get it out.
 FIRST/BUFFY:
 I heard you, Caleb.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.643
We're almost there.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.846
Yes. That's true.

38:00.878 --> 38:02.880
Now, rouse the Bringers.
Get them back to work.
(clattering)

38:05.717 --> 38:08.820
Hey! Heard you got
something of mine.

38:15.193 --> 38:18.028
Well! If it ain't
the Prodigal Slayer.

38:20.231 --> 38:22.800
Where's it at?
Well, I'm gonna find it,
sooner or later.

38:22.833 --> 38:27.005
No, you're not. I lay one
hand on you, and you're
just a dead little girl.

38:28.206 --> 38:31.208
Lay a hand on me.
If you can.

38:51.061 --> 38:53.164
Caleb, this is
getting embarrassing.

38:53.197 --> 38:55.701
-Do you have to look like that?
-Will you concentrate?

38:55.733 --> 38:59.838
-It's just a little confusing!
-Fine. Go. Kill.

39:16.353 --> 39:20.190
Everybody stop.
I think we just found it.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.293
Look at all this.

39:23.360 --> 39:25.362
VI:
I don't get it.

39:25.396 --> 39:27.097
Why'd they abandon
all this stuff?

39:28.766 --> 39:31.469
-Maybe 'cause they didn't.
-(sword being drawn)

40:12.911 --> 40:14.179
(screaming)

40:35.800 --> 40:37.469
You whore!

40:39.538 --> 40:41.639
You know, you really
should watch your language.

40:41.672 --> 40:45.210
If someone didn't know you,
they might think you were
a woman-hating jerk.

40:59.690 --> 41:01.659
VI:
Is that it? I mean,

41:01.693 --> 41:03.762
not that that
wasn't fun, but--

41:03.795 --> 41:06.231
Yo, Faith! Check this out.

42:01.251 --> 42:03.288
(murmuring)

42:06.858 --> 42:09.327
-(beeping)
-Everybody get down!

42:09.360 --> 42:11.496
(screaming)
(beeping)

42:11.528 --> 42:14.565
(beeping continues)

42:39.389 --> 42:41.592
Grr! Arrgh!
