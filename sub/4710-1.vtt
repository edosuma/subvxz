03:34.280 --> 03:35.349
Grandma.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.155
Your eggs.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.995
It's Billy.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.073
Come on.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.634
Fuck.

04:09.480 --> 04:13.109
- You been playing my records, you twat?
- I never played naught.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.079
Knobhead.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.548
If Dad knew you smoked that stuff,
he'd go mental.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.039
Fuck off, will ya!

04:23.520 --> 04:24.919
Little twat.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.475
Here we go, Dad. Come on, man.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.469
Dad!

04:42.720 --> 04:44.790
Hurry up, Dad, man. We'll be late.

04:44.920 --> 04:48.595
I'm telling you, the whole world
will be on that picket line this morning.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.989
Have you tidied our room? Dad!

04:51.760 --> 04:53.352
There's not much coal left.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.079
That's fine.
We'll be digging it up again next month.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.793
Don't kid yourself.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.233
I'm not waiting for you.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.514
Tony!

05:03.640 --> 05:05.835
See you down the picket line, Dad.

05:08.560 --> 05:09.913
Leave it, Billy.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.872
Mom would have let us.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.549
Your 50 pence is on the fridge.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.630
Scab, scab, scab!

06:20.720 --> 06:23.314
- Are you sure you're not going to come?
- Am I fuck.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.595
- It's a right load of old bollocks.
- It's not.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.353
It's a load of shite, kicking people in.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.113
I don't know why you bother.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.792
- I'm good at it.
- Are you shite.

06:31.880 --> 06:35.714
- Look at them gloves. They're outdated.
- They're me dad's, these.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.119
Exactly.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.070
Right, lads. Listen up here.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.594
Hold it. Right.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.150
Here.
Now, because they're using downstairs...

06:48.240 --> 06:51.277
...as a soup kitchen
for the striking miners...

06:51.440 --> 06:53.635
...I'm gonna let Mrs. Wilkinson...

06:53.760 --> 06:57.389
...use the bottom end of the boxing hall
for her ballet lessons.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.120
So, no hanky-panky, understood?

07:00.320 --> 07:01.594
Yes.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.477
Elliot, you're late.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.796
Get changed and get in here.

07:08.760 --> 07:09.875
Right then, lads.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.315
Give it all you got. Round one.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.878
Don't just stand there, Elliot.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.474
Not again. This is man-to-man combat,
not a bloody tea dance.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.836
What are you doing, man? Hit him!

07:32.360 --> 07:35.557
He's just pissing about.
Get stuck in and give him a belt.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.358
He's like a fanny in a fit.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.192
Billy, hit him!

07:42.600 --> 07:44.795
Jesus Christ, Billy Elliot!

07:44.880 --> 07:46.632
You're a disgrace to them gloves...

07:46.720 --> 07:49.792
...your father,
and the traditions of this boxing hall.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.757
You owe us 50 pence.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.515
Ho! Liberace!

07:54.600 --> 07:56.431
Will you give it a rest?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.150
Billy, punch bag.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.518
You're not going until you do it properly.

08:11.920 --> 08:12.909
Shit.

08:14.120 --> 08:18.989
Give these to Mrs. Wilkinson and her class
when you're done. I'll see you next week.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.397
Okay, girls. Left hand on the bar.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.550
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.198
Pretty arms.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.589
Bottoms in.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.789
Where are you looking, Susan?

08:35.720 --> 08:38.951
Lift. Feel the music. Feel it.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.870
In time, Debbie, please.

08:43.880 --> 08:47.668
And one, and two, and three, and four...

08:47.760 --> 08:51.514
...and five, six, seven, eight.

08:51.600 --> 08:55.479
And one, and two, and three, and four...

08:55.920 --> 08:57.114
...five.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.793
And hold.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.799
Hold it.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.676
Support yourselves.
Don't look at me. Look ahead.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.870
Where's your confidence? Come on.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.753
And down.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.633
Connie.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.269
Oh, God.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.196
And Debbie, eyes front.

09:27.280 --> 09:31.717
And five, and six, and seven, and stop.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.639
For God's sake.
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.234
Right, into the center, girls, please.

09:41.920 --> 09:42.955
Miss?

09:43.480 --> 09:45.596
- Miss, the keys.
- Not now.

09:46.360 --> 09:49.796
Right, Mr. Braithwaite.
<i>The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow.</i>

09:50.040 --> 09:51.473
Fat chance.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.437
Ready, and...

09:55.840 --> 09:57.558
<i>Port de bras</i> forward...

09:57.760 --> 09:59.193
...and up.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.592
<i>Port de bras</i> forward...

10:02.040 --> 10:03.473
...and up.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.631
Why don't you join in?

10:09.080 --> 10:11.275
<i>Port de bras</i> forward...

10:11.520 --> 10:13.317
...and up...

10:13.480 --> 10:15.311
...and hold.

10:15.760 --> 10:20.038
And three, and four,
and Debbie, straight leg...

10:20.160 --> 10:21.513
...seven and eight.

10:21.600 --> 10:25.752
And one, and two, and three, and four...

10:26.000 --> 10:27.911
...and five... Boots off!

10:28.000 --> 10:30.560
Seven and eight. What size are you?

10:30.640 --> 10:33.279
- Miss, what about the keys?
- Into the center.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.752
Go on, I dare you.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.998
Prepare.

10:42.160 --> 10:46.517
And one, and two, and three, and four...

10:46.720 --> 10:49.359
...and five, and six, and...

10:50.240 --> 10:52.629
And eight, and hold.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.513
Hold it.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.076
What have we got here, then?

11:07.960 --> 11:09.188
Heel out.

11:09.480 --> 11:10.674
Drop your hip.

11:11.760 --> 11:12.988
Nice...

11:13.080 --> 11:15.150
...straight leg.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.033
Good arch.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.758
Turn that leg out.

11:23.360 --> 11:24.952
Right. Class dismissed.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.359
Hometime.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.631
Debbie, get the 50 pences.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.630
- You owe me 50 pence.
- No, I don't!

11:37.800 --> 11:40.234
You do.
Why don't you bring it along next week?

11:40.520 --> 11:42.238
I can't. I'm going to boxing.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.515
- But you're crap at boxing.
- No, I'm not!

11:44.600 --> 11:45.999
Shut up.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.678
I thought you enjoyed it.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.551
Please yourself, darling.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.191
<i>"Dancing in my tails"</i>

12:35.960 --> 12:38.713
He was your mom's favorite,
was Fred Astaire.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.554
We used to watch him
at the Palace Picture House...

12:41.640 --> 12:44.996
...and then dance around the front room
like lunatics.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.719
Marvelous!

12:47.000 --> 12:50.197
Mind, they used to say
I could have been a professional.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.150
Come on, Grandma. Not now.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.079
Grandma!

13:30.080 --> 13:31.832
It's this one here!

13:33.680 --> 13:34.874
Grandma!

13:35.080 --> 13:36.798
It's over here!

13:39.040 --> 13:40.155
Tony?

13:40.560 --> 13:43.074
- Do you ever think about death?
- Fuck off!

13:47.800 --> 13:49.199
Night-night, then.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.717
Plenty of boys do ballet, you know.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.314
Do they now? What boys do ballet?

14:00.400 --> 14:02.994
Nobody around here, but plenty of men do.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.269
Poofs.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.992
Not necessarily poofs.

14:06.520 --> 14:07.555
Who, like?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.240
What about that Wayne Sleep?
He's not a poof.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.151
He's as fit as an athlete.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.949
- Bet he couldn't beat Daley Thompson.
- Maybe not in a race, but in stamina.

14:16.320 --> 14:19.039
- Come tomorrow. You can just watch.
- I can't.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.798
Gotta go to boxing, haven't I?

14:21.880 --> 14:23.632
Please yourself, then.

14:24.520 --> 14:25.919
See you around.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.752
Aye. See ya.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.598
Right, lads. Look sharp. Everybody out.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.152
Turn, turn and stop.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.711
One, two, three. One, two, three.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.438
Arms are in fifth.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.871
One, two, three.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.439
Turn, turn and stop.

15:01.960 --> 15:05.475
One, two, three. Where are those arms?

15:05.560 --> 15:07.551
- I don't know what to do.
- Follow the others.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.393
Shut up, Debbie. One, two, three.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.879
Nice pretty arms. And stop.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.833
See? I told you it takes loads of practice.

15:18.920 --> 15:20.797
- Debbie.
- What, Mom?

15:21.480 --> 15:23.948
- What do you call me?
- Miss.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.473
Shove off!

15:26.880 --> 15:29.838
So, do we get the pleasure
of your company next week?

15:30.720 --> 15:32.153
It's just...

15:32.240 --> 15:33.753
...I feel like a right sissy.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.752
Well, don't act like one.
Fifty pence, please.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.397
If you're not coming again,
give us your shoes.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.955
- You're all right.
- Right.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.149
What are you doing,
going around like creeping Jesus?

16:15.240 --> 16:16.434
Naught.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.632
They found your nanna in the Spar stores.
Where have you been?

16:19.720 --> 16:21.358
Boxing. Where do you think?

16:21.440 --> 16:22.873
What are you doing?

16:22.960 --> 16:25.997
- I forgot me gloves.
- They were my dad's gloves.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.119
You better take better care of them, okay?

16:52.440 --> 16:55.512
Copy down that diagram.
You only have five minutes left.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.233
Hurry. This way.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.998
You're going to ballet every week?

17:27.079 --> 17:29.719
- Yeah, but don't tell.
- Why do you need to take lessons?

17:29.800 --> 17:32.394
Why do you think?
To get better, you divvy.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.869
- Do you get to wear a tutu?
- Fuck off!

17:35.120 --> 17:37.315
They're only meant for lasses.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.153
I wear me shorts.

17:39.240 --> 17:42.073
- You want to ask for a tutu.
- What for?

17:43.280 --> 17:45.475
- To dance in.
- I'd look a right dickhead.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.471
I think you'd look wicked.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.475
Come on.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.994
I don't know why you're looking at that.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.999
You can't take that out on a junior ticket.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.879
Come on!

19:01.720 --> 19:02.914
See you, then.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.798
<i>Okay, Billy Elliot, he's the center.</i>

19:26.160 --> 19:28.594
<i>Right, I want you to watch carefully, girls.</i>

19:28.680 --> 19:30.238
<i>First, arabesque.</i>

19:31.240 --> 19:32.719
Drop your shoulders.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.398
Look forward, beyond your fingertips.

19:41.880 --> 19:42.710
There.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.398
Right. Spin it, Mr. Braithwaite. Spin it.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.472
Come on! Spin it!

19:49.640 --> 19:50.993
Now, focus.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.556
Look at yourselves! Look in the mirror!

20:00.920 --> 20:03.229
Christ almighty! What was that?

20:03.960 --> 20:05.632
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

20:06.280 --> 20:10.353
Prepare one, and two. Strong position.

20:10.680 --> 20:11.556
<i>Weight on both legs.</i>

20:14.320 --> 20:16.117
Pirouette, and down.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.952
Up you get.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.719
Find a place on that bloody wall...

20:26.800 --> 20:29.473
...and focus on that spot.

20:30.280 --> 20:33.670
Then whip your head round
and come back to that spot.

20:33.920 --> 20:34.796
Prepare!

20:35.440 --> 20:38.318
<i>- One, and two, and...</i>
- Fuck it.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.830
Have you got the spot?

20:43.960 --> 20:45.359
<i>Prepare.</i>

20:46.640 --> 20:49.200
<i>- Prepare!</i>
- Prepare.

20:50.440 --> 20:51.759
Go!

20:56.520 --> 20:57.919
<i>Go, Billy!</i>

21:05.320 --> 21:07.675
What have I told you about that arm?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.116
Right. Back to the bar.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.475
You look like a right wanker to me, son.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.838
Listen, it was just 50 pence a session,
you know.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.434
I can do without it.
I don't do it for the money.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.670
- What are you talking about?
- The boxing.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.069
I haven't seen
hide nor hair of Billy for months.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.311
I was gonna say something,
but I thought it might be embarrassing.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.868
First, I knew about it.
He's never got the gloves off.

22:18.960 --> 22:22.270
Send him round to my house.
I'll knock some sense into him.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.275
Scab! Scab!

22:32.520 --> 22:35.478
Step, open and <i>balancé.</i>

22:35.640 --> 22:36.789
<i>Balancé.</i>

22:36.920 --> 22:40.390
Scab, scab, scab!

22:43.400 --> 22:45.516
Right. Let's do it again.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.679
Open and lift your chest.

22:52.760 --> 22:55.399
Let's do it again.
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite. Step...

22:56.200 --> 22:57.679
<i>Open your arms. Do it.</i>

22:58.120 --> 22:59.314
Pay attention.

22:59.560 --> 23:02.028
Arms like this. All right?

23:02.240 --> 23:04.674
Thank you, Mr. Braithwaite. Step really...

23:05.080 --> 23:06.115
<i>...open.</i>

23:06.280 --> 23:08.077
<i>Powerful! Proud.</i>

23:13.120 --> 23:14.758
You're not concentrating.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.752
- Yes, I am concentrating.
- You're not even trying.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.197
Can we have a go at it, Miss?

23:21.480 --> 23:23.038
Let's do it again.

23:27.560 --> 23:30.358
Listen, have you noticed anything weird
about Billy lately?

23:30.440 --> 23:32.829
What are you after, like, a list?

23:42.480 --> 23:44.471
Got enough food there, scab?

23:45.680 --> 23:47.113
What are you doing?

23:47.200 --> 23:49.998
- Scabs eat well, eh?
- You're me best mate.

23:50.640 --> 23:54.269
First rule of a union, Gary,
you never cross a picket line.

23:59.680 --> 24:03.070
- We're all fucked if you forget that!
- We're fucked anyway.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.160
<i>In a speech to Tory MPs yesterday...</i>

24:07.240 --> 24:09.959
<i>...Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher</i>
<i>referred to members...</i>

24:10.040 --> 24:12.918
<i>...of the striking National Union</i>
<i>of Mine Workers...</i>

24:13.000 --> 24:15.070
<i>...as the "enemy within."</i>

24:15.400 --> 24:18.437
<i>The speech comes following</i>
<i>several months of violent clashes...</i>

24:18.520 --> 24:21.318
<i>...between police officers</i>
<i>and striking miners.</i>

24:21.920 --> 24:24.798
- See you, then.
- Wait. Your breakfast...

24:26.760 --> 24:28.159
What the hell's he up to?

24:37.560 --> 24:40.279
One, two, three, <i>pas de bourrée.</i>

24:40.360 --> 24:44.069
And one, two, three, and a turn.

24:44.720 --> 24:48.076
And one, two, three, <i>pas de bourrée.</i>

25:07.160 --> 25:09.390
You, out!

25:09.720 --> 25:10.709
Now!

25:10.920 --> 25:12.717
I beg your pardon?

25:16.480 --> 25:17.708
Please, Miss.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.509
Don't.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.669
All right, which way are we facing?
Come on.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.512
And one...

25:34.680 --> 25:37.319
...two, three, <i>pas de bourrée.</i>

25:37.720 --> 25:38.755
Ballet?

25:39.520 --> 25:41.158
What's wrong with ballet?

25:41.240 --> 25:42.912
What's "wrong" with ballet?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.911
It's perfectly normal.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.553
"Perfectly normal"?

25:48.400 --> 25:50.038
I used to go to ballet.

25:50.360 --> 25:51.349
See?

25:51.720 --> 25:53.153
Aye, for your nanna.

25:53.680 --> 25:56.148
For girls, not for lads, Billy.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.956
Lads do football, or...

26:00.440 --> 26:01.793
...boxing, or...

26:03.440 --> 26:04.589
...wrestling.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.154
Not frigging ballet.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.992
What lads do wrestling?

26:14.840 --> 26:15.955
Don't start.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.870
I don't see what's wrong with it.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.837
You know exactly what's wrong with it.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.751
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.713
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you bloody well do.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.552
Who do you think I am?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.592
You know quite nicely.

26:33.840 --> 26:34.955
What?

26:36.400 --> 26:38.391
What are you trying to say, Dad?

26:42.120 --> 26:44.839
- You're asking for a hiding, son.
- I'm not, honest.

26:44.920 --> 26:46.751
You are, Billy.

26:46.840 --> 26:50.913
It's not just poofs, Dad.
Some ballet dancers are as fit as athletes.

26:51.080 --> 26:53.992
What about that Wayne Sleep?
He was a ballet dancer.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.669
- Wayne Sleep?
- Aye.

26:59.800 --> 27:04.396
Listen, son, from now on
you can forget about the fucking ballet.

27:04.480 --> 27:07.153
You can forget about the fucking boxing,
as well.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.993
I'm busting my ass for those 50 pences,
and you're...

27:10.080 --> 27:12.992
No, from now on you stay here,
you look after your nanna.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.149
Got it?

27:17.080 --> 27:18.069
Good.

27:21.960 --> 27:25.475
They used to say I could've been
a professional dancer, with some training.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.073
Will you shut up?

27:30.280 --> 27:31.679
I hate you!

27:32.440 --> 27:33.793
You're a bastard!

27:42.240 --> 27:43.514
Get off!

27:45.760 --> 27:46.670
Billy!

28:55.160 --> 28:56.149
Hello.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.756
My dad'll kill me if he knows I'm here.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.035
He's stopped you coming to classes.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.632
It's not his fault, Miss.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.438
That's all right with you, is it?

29:08.480 --> 29:09.708
I suppose so.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.113
You should stand up to him.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.111
You don't know what he's like.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.639
Well, that blows it.

29:17.720 --> 29:19.790
- Blows what, Miss?
- Debbie.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.430
I've heard a lot about you.
Durham's little Gene Kelly, eh?

29:28.080 --> 29:29.832
Your dad worked down the pit, then?

29:29.920 --> 29:30.875
Yeah.

29:30.960 --> 29:33.235
Must be hard for the family,
being on strike.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.595
He is out on strike, isn't he?

29:36.040 --> 29:36.950
Of course.

29:37.040 --> 29:39.190
I shouldn't worry. They won't last long.

29:39.280 --> 29:40.429
Tom, don't.

29:40.600 --> 29:44.832
If they voted, they'd be back tomorrow.
It's just a few commies, stirring things up.

29:45.320 --> 29:47.754
Let's face it,
they haven't got a leg to stand on.

29:47.840 --> 29:48.955
Who doesn't?

29:49.760 --> 29:50.954
The miners.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.159
It stands to reason.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.316
Some pits are just uneconomical.

29:55.400 --> 29:58.198
If it costs more to pay everybody
to dig the coal out...

29:58.280 --> 30:01.192
...than you get for it when you sell it,
what does that say?

30:01.280 --> 30:02.349
I don't know.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.314
You wanna think about that,
don't you, son?

30:05.680 --> 30:06.669
Tom.

30:06.760 --> 30:09.479
If it was up to me,
I'd shut them all down tomorrow.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.439
For God's sake.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.511
What do you do, Mr. Wilkinson?

30:14.640 --> 30:16.471
He's been made redundant.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.160
- I thought he was gonna hit me.
- Don't be silly.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.276
He's just under a lot of pressure.

30:27.880 --> 30:31.270
That's what Mom says.
I think it's because he drinks too much.

30:31.520 --> 30:33.158
Does he drink too much?

30:33.280 --> 30:35.999
He's always pissed.
Once he pissed himself.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.115
Your dad?

30:37.200 --> 30:40.636
'Cause he's unhappy and that.
'Cause they sleep in separate beds.

30:40.720 --> 30:44.156
- Why do they sleep in separate beds?
- So they can't have sex.

30:44.360 --> 30:45.839
Do they not have sex?

30:45.920 --> 30:49.515
Dad did it with this woman from work,
but they don't think I know.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.678
Do you miss your mom, then?

30:55.880 --> 30:57.950
I don't really miss her as such.

30:58.080 --> 31:00.150
It's more like just feeling sad.

31:01.080 --> 31:03.878
Especially when I remember her
all of a sudden.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.668
When I'd forgot that she was dead
and that.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.714
What about your mom?
Does she not have sex?

31:09.880 --> 31:12.792
No, she's unfulfilled.
That's why she does dancing.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.435
She does dancing instead of sex?

31:15.640 --> 31:17.915
- Your family's weird.
- No, they're not.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.996
They are though. They're mental.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.353
Get off!

31:51.480 --> 31:54.358
See? You're a nutter, you.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.278
Debbie, it's time for Billy to go home.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.028
Come on, Billy.
I'll drop you off at the corner.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.633
I'll see you, Debbie.

32:19.720 --> 32:20.789
Okay, then.

32:31.800 --> 32:32.949
Miss...

32:33.440 --> 32:35.271
...what have I blown?

32:39.760 --> 32:41.716
This'll sound strange, Billy...

32:41.960 --> 32:45.748
...but, for some time now,
I've thought of the Royal Ballet School.

32:48.320 --> 32:49.799
Aren't you a bit old?

32:50.040 --> 32:52.474
No, not me. You.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.551
I'm the bloody teacher.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.995
They hold auditions in Newcastle.

32:58.520 --> 33:00.988
I'd never be good enough.
I hardly know aught.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.310
They're not interested
in how much you know.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.039
They'll teach you.
That's why they're a ballet school.

33:06.120 --> 33:09.590
It's how you move,
how you express yourself that's important.

33:09.760 --> 33:10.954
Express what?

33:11.440 --> 33:13.749
I think you're good enough to go for it.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.469
It would mean an awful lot of hard work.

33:21.560 --> 33:22.834
But I'm banned.

33:23.680 --> 33:26.478
- Maybe I should have a word with him.
- No, Miss!

33:26.680 --> 33:29.831
- I could teach you on your own.
- We couldn't afford it.

33:30.240 --> 33:33.198
- I'm not doing it for the money.
- What about Dad?

33:33.280 --> 33:35.396
- He doesn't need to know.
- What about boxing?

33:35.480 --> 33:38.790
Listen, if you wanna piss about
with your mates, that's fine with me.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.871
All right, don't lose your blob.

33:42.720 --> 33:43.789
"Blob"?

33:48.600 --> 33:50.636
So, we could do it private like?

33:50.920 --> 33:52.194
Just you and me.

33:58.040 --> 34:00.759
Miss, you don't fancy me, do you?

34:03.120 --> 34:05.509
No, Billy. Funnily enough, I don't.

34:05.640 --> 34:06.914
Now, piss off.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.199
Piss off yourself.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.598
See you Monday, then.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.398
You coming in or what?

34:39.719 --> 34:42.598
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Just dressing up.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.755
- Whose dress is that?
- Come on.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.753
- Whose dress is that?
- It's me sister's.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.996
- Did she give you it?
- She doesn't know.

35:03.080 --> 35:05.799
Do you wanna try?
You can have one of me mom's.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.195
No. You all right?

35:13.760 --> 35:16.797
- What are you doing that for?
- I'm just trying it on.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.233
Christ.

35:21.560 --> 35:22.959
Come here.

35:25.360 --> 35:26.509
Stay still.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.195
There.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.914
- Won't we get in trouble?
- Don't be stupid.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.592
Me dad does it all the time.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.511
He dresses up in your mom's clothes?

35:36.600 --> 35:39.160
Only when he thinks everybody's out.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.591
Have you got a tutu yet?

35:42.520 --> 35:45.956
Do you think being a ballet dancer
would be better than being a miner?

35:46.040 --> 35:47.553
I don't know.

35:47.680 --> 35:51.229
It's just, I've got this audition
in Newcastle, in a couple of weeks.

35:51.320 --> 35:53.993
- What for?
- To go to ballet school.

35:54.080 --> 35:57.117
Ballet school? Is that in Newcastle?

35:57.240 --> 35:58.275
London.

35:58.760 --> 36:01.479
You'd have to move
with your Tony and everybody?

36:01.800 --> 36:05.156
- No, by myself.
- That's a bit steep.

36:05.440 --> 36:08.477
- Can't you be a ballet dancer here?
- Don't be stupid.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.550
- When are you going there?
- I don't know.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.358
I haven't even got in yet.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.271
What does your dad say?

36:17.560 --> 36:19.630
- He doesn't know.
- Fucking hell.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.558
- Are you not going to tell him?
- Not yet, anyway.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.474
He might be pleased about it.
He could rent your room.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.551
He couldn't. What about our Tony?

36:29.120 --> 36:30.553
What do you reckon?

36:34.280 --> 36:36.032
I think you shouldn't bother.

36:36.120 --> 36:37.189
Why not?

36:37.760 --> 36:39.637
I'd miss ya.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.433
Fucking hell.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.159
Brought your things?

37:14.320 --> 37:16.356
I don't know if they're right, Miss.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.829
If they're special to you, they're right.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.073
What are they for?

37:21.320 --> 37:23.390
To give us some ideas for a dance.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.750
Come on, then. Let's see them.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.554
What's that?

37:58.080 --> 37:59.274
It's a letter.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.798
I can see it's a letter.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.313
It's me mom's.

38:06.280 --> 38:08.111
She wrote it, for when I was 18...

38:08.200 --> 38:10.077
...but I opened it.

38:17.360 --> 38:18.395
Here.

38:37.320 --> 38:39.311
"To my son, Billy.

38:42.280 --> 38:43.633
"Dear Billy:

38:44.520 --> 38:47.512
"I know I must seem
like a distant memory to you...

38:48.080 --> 38:50.196
"...which is probably a good thing.

38:50.840 --> 38:53.035
"It will have been a long time...

38:53.720 --> 38:55.915
"...and I will have missed seeing you grow.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.992
"Missed you crying, laughing...

38:59.160 --> 39:00.559
"...and shouting.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.790
"I will have missed telling you off.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.360
"But please know that I was always there.

39:12.880 --> 39:15.110
"With you through everything.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.236
"With you through everything.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.472
"I always will be.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.830
"And I am proud to have known you.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.116
"And I'm proud that you were mine.

39:28.720 --> 39:30.551
"Always be yourself.

39:31.880 --> 39:34.155
"I'll love you forever.

39:37.600 --> 39:38.794
"Mom."

39:49.040 --> 39:51.998
She must have been a very special woman,
your mother.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.077
No, she was just me mom.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.957
I brought a tape and all.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.990
- What is it?
- <i>I Love to Boogie.</i>

40:04.000 --> 40:05.638
It's one of our Tony's.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.759
Spin it!

40:31.440 --> 40:32.509
Go on!

40:48.240 --> 40:49.673
Tap, tap.

40:49.920 --> 40:50.796
Go!

41:47.400 --> 41:49.470
Grandma, teatime.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.238
Where are you going?

42:04.480 --> 42:06.471
Go back to sleep.

42:06.640 --> 42:07.993
It's 4:00.

42:35.760 --> 42:38.228
You weren't thinking of taking it with you?

42:38.800 --> 42:40.358
If you just wanna stand around...

42:40.440 --> 42:43.079
...getting the shit kicked out of you,
that's fine.

42:43.160 --> 42:46.835
- Some of us are ready to fight back.
- They're already after you.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.557
You're no good to us in jail.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.232
I don't plan on getting caught.

42:51.320 --> 42:53.754
- What's going on?
- Get back to bed.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.713
Both of you!

42:55.800 --> 42:57.392
Fuck you.

42:59.640 --> 43:01.312
Put it down.

43:01.400 --> 43:03.436
- You gonna stop me?
- I'm warning you.

43:03.520 --> 43:05.636
You haven't got it in you. You're finished!

43:05.720 --> 43:09.190
Since Mom died, you're a useless twat.
What are you gonna do about it?

43:09.440 --> 43:11.476
Stop it!

43:43.840 --> 43:46.479
What the fuck are you looking at?

43:48.200 --> 43:50.509
You haven't been practicing.

43:51.360 --> 43:52.679
Prepare.

43:52.760 --> 43:56.469
One, two, and one, and two.

43:57.640 --> 43:59.039
Get up.

43:59.960 --> 44:02.076
Miss, I can't do it.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.834
That's because you're not concentrating.

44:05.920 --> 44:08.150
I am concentrating.

44:08.360 --> 44:10.828
- You're not even trying.
- I am, Miss.

44:11.320 --> 44:13.436
- Do it again.
- I can't.

44:14.880 --> 44:17.838
You do it again.

44:25.600 --> 44:26.715
No!

44:34.840 --> 44:36.239
Shit.

44:57.400 --> 44:58.389
I'm sorry.

44:58.480 --> 45:01.472
It's all right for you.
It's not you who has to do it.

45:02.280 --> 45:04.271
- I know.
- You don't know anything!

45:04.360 --> 45:08.035
What do you know in your posh house,
with your husband that pisses himself?

45:08.120 --> 45:11.749
You're the same as everybody else.
All you want is to tell me what to do!

45:11.840 --> 45:13.671
Now, wait a minute.

45:13.920 --> 45:16.514
I don't want to do your stupid,
fucking audition.

45:16.600 --> 45:19.114
You only want me to do it
for your own benefit!

45:19.200 --> 45:20.189
Look, Billy...

45:20.280 --> 45:23.750
- Because you're a failure!
- Don't you dare talk to me like that.

45:23.840 --> 45:25.956
You don't even have
a proper dancing school.

45:26.040 --> 45:28.031
You're stuck in some crummy boxing hall!

45:28.120 --> 45:31.078
Don't pick on me
because you fucked up your own life!

46:13.840 --> 46:15.478
<i>Can I put a tape on, Miss?</i>

46:15.560 --> 46:17.630
<i>All right, if you must.</i>

46:57.600 --> 46:59.431
It's cush, isn't it?

47:02.480 --> 47:04.436
So, is there a story, then, Miss?

47:05.560 --> 47:06.913
Of course.

47:07.720 --> 47:12.032
It's about a woman
who's captured by an evil magician.

47:12.320 --> 47:13.673
Sounds crap.

47:14.920 --> 47:17.673
And this woman, this beautiful woman...

47:17.840 --> 47:20.229
...is forced to be a swan...

47:21.560 --> 47:24.279
...except for a few hours every night...

47:24.760 --> 47:26.637
...when she becomes alive.

47:27.920 --> 47:30.150
When she becomes real again.

47:33.400 --> 47:35.118
And then, one night...

47:36.320 --> 47:38.390
...she meets this young prince...

47:39.840 --> 47:41.910
...and he falls in love with her.

47:43.840 --> 47:45.478
And she realizes...

47:46.640 --> 47:49.359
...this is the one thing that will allow her...

47:49.680 --> 47:52.069
...to become a real woman once more.

47:54.160 --> 47:55.832
So then what happens?

47:56.640 --> 48:00.269
He promises to marry her
and goes off with someone else, of course.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.152
So she has to be a swan for good?

48:02.240 --> 48:03.468
She dies.

48:04.280 --> 48:05.998
'Cause the prince didn't love her?

48:06.080 --> 48:07.957
Come on. It's time to go.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.677
It's only a ghost story.

48:12.960 --> 48:14.313
Come on.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.313
It's me.

48:49.080 --> 48:50.433
It's Billy.

48:53.640 --> 48:55.517
Oh, little one.

49:18.480 --> 49:19.959
Oh, little one...

49:20.640 --> 49:23.438
...what have I told you
about drinking out of the bottle?

49:23.520 --> 49:24.873
Sorry, Mom.

49:33.760 --> 49:35.591
Well, put it back.

49:54.760 --> 49:56.193
One.

49:56.480 --> 49:57.959
Lift...

49:58.240 --> 50:00.117
...and reach.

50:00.800 --> 50:03.360
Down, and one.

50:04.360 --> 50:07.716
Breathe and stretch.

50:08.840 --> 50:10.637
And one.

50:10.960 --> 50:13.520
Lift and stretch.

50:17.440 --> 50:18.475
Lift...

50:18.560 --> 50:21.074
...and lengthen that foot.

50:21.160 --> 50:22.912
And it's one.

50:25.120 --> 50:26.712
Extend.

50:28.560 --> 50:30.312
Reach out.

50:31.480 --> 50:34.358
Lift and breathe.

50:36.440 --> 50:37.839
And one.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.633
Lift.

50:40.720 --> 50:43.871
Out and close.

50:43.960 --> 50:45.871
And one.

50:46.240 --> 50:47.639
Lift.

51:22.720 --> 51:24.392
When's the audition, then?

51:24.600 --> 51:25.953
Tomorrow morning.

51:27.600 --> 51:29.511
I'll miss you if you go away.

51:29.760 --> 51:32.911
Who do you think is better,
Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers?

51:34.800 --> 51:36.836
Billy, do you not fancy us, like?

51:40.360 --> 51:42.794
Don't know. Never really thought about it.

51:48.880 --> 51:51.189
If you want, I'll show you me fanny.

51:57.920 --> 52:00.070
No. You're all right.

52:22.760 --> 52:24.478
- Get inside.
- Come on.

52:24.560 --> 52:26.915
That's the union leader. Get him!

52:29.440 --> 52:30.953
Get down!

52:51.040 --> 52:52.393
Thanks, pet.

52:59.920 --> 53:01.478
Wanker!

53:08.080 --> 53:09.911
Keep away from there, son.

53:11.200 --> 53:12.599
Shit.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.231
Here they come!

53:41.080 --> 53:42.149
Fuck!

53:50.520 --> 53:51.589
Tony!

53:55.040 --> 53:56.792
Tony, come back!

54:12.360 --> 54:14.794
Take him away. Off you go, mate.

54:30.160 --> 54:32.628
<i>Miss, I've got a problem with the audition.</i>

54:33.760 --> 54:35.239
Hello?

54:45.240 --> 54:47.196
Right, listings for Court 4.

54:47.440 --> 54:48.793
Tony Elliot.

54:49.400 --> 54:52.073
George Brunton. Gary Cummings.

54:52.160 --> 54:54.674
- What's the time?
- Colin Woodward.

54:55.200 --> 54:57.077
14:10.

55:37.120 --> 55:38.235
Hello.

55:44.160 --> 55:45.798
Can I help you?

55:46.760 --> 55:48.591
- I was looking...
- They're out.

55:48.920 --> 55:50.273
Sorry.

55:58.240 --> 55:59.912
- Billy?
- Please, Miss.

56:00.560 --> 56:03.074
- Don't.
- What's going on, Billy?

56:04.120 --> 56:05.951
Who the fuck are you?

56:07.880 --> 56:09.871
I think we better go inside.

56:16.720 --> 56:18.756
I know this might be hard for you...

56:18.840 --> 56:22.276
...but, today,
Billy missed a very important audition.

56:23.360 --> 56:24.634
Audition?

56:25.400 --> 56:27.231
For the Royal Ballet School.

56:31.840 --> 56:33.193
The Royal Ballet?

56:33.280 --> 56:36.192
School. It's where they teach the ballet.

56:37.760 --> 56:39.637
You've got to be joking, love.

56:39.720 --> 56:42.109
No, I'm perfectly serious.

56:48.360 --> 56:50.828
Have you any idea
what we're going through?

56:51.920 --> 56:53.751
I've been in a fucking cell, all night...

56:53.840 --> 56:56.798
...and you come around here, talking shite.
And you...

56:57.320 --> 56:58.719
Fucking ballet!

56:59.800 --> 57:03.588
What are you trying to do, make him
a scab for the rest of his life? Look at him.

57:03.680 --> 57:05.671
He's only 11, for fuck's sake.

57:05.760 --> 57:08.718
- You've got to start training young.
- Shut it.

57:08.800 --> 57:13.351
I'm not having my brother running around
like a right twat for your gratification.

57:13.440 --> 57:16.477
Excuse me.
This is not for my gratification.

57:16.560 --> 57:19.028
What good will it do him?
You're not taking him away.

57:19.120 --> 57:21.634
He's only a bairn.
What about giving him a childhood?

57:21.720 --> 57:23.836
I don't want one.
I wanna be a ballet dancer.

57:23.920 --> 57:26.115
And anyway, what do you know about it?

57:26.200 --> 57:28.031
What qualifications have you got?

57:28.120 --> 57:30.634
Look, I haven't come here
to defend myself.

57:30.720 --> 57:33.188
Well, for all we know,
you could be some nutter.

57:33.280 --> 57:34.998
Get the fucking Social on to you.

57:35.080 --> 57:37.355
I think you should calm yourself down, son.

57:37.480 --> 57:38.959
You say he can dance?

57:40.320 --> 57:41.673
Go on, then.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.037
Let's see this fucking dancing.

57:45.120 --> 57:46.269
This is ridiculous!

57:46.360 --> 57:49.796
If you're a fucking ballet dancer,
then let's be having you.

57:49.880 --> 57:52.633
- Don't you dare!
- What sort of a teacher are you?

57:52.920 --> 57:56.595
He's got the chance to dance.
Now, you're fucking telling him not to.

57:56.720 --> 57:58.358
Dance, you little twat!

58:03.800 --> 58:06.075
So, piss off.
He's not doing any more ballet!

58:06.160 --> 58:09.197
If you go near him again,
I'll smack you, you middle-class cow.

58:09.280 --> 58:12.238
You know nothing about me,
you sanctimonious little shit!

58:14.120 --> 58:17.795
He won't grow up to race whippets,
grow leeks or piss his wages up the wall.

58:17.880 --> 58:19.393
Listen! He's been with me...

59:52.520 --> 59:55.318
Billy, wait there!

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.837
Billy, come on!

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.912
Hurry up!

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.071
<i>Merry Christmas, everybody!</i>

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.952
"Here we go, here we go, here we go"

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.757
Do you think she'll mind?

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.959
Shut it, Billy. She's dead.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.110
Well, merry Christmas, everybody.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.152
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.992
Merry Christmas.

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:12.829
"Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.837
"Oh, what fun"

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.635
Fucking great Christmas this has been.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.556
- Go on, have some.
- Where'd you get it?

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.312
Me dad's got loads in the kitchen.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.312
- Won't he notice?
- He never knows how much is there.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.034
- It tastes like piss.
- You get used to it.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.393
Here.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.037
Maybe you could run away or something.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.156
You know, join a dancing troupe.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.878
Don't be so stupid.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.194
- Well, maybe it's all for the best.
- What do you mean?

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.589
You won't have to go away or nothing.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.478
My hands are freezing.

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.992
Give us them here.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.913
What are you doing?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.230
Nothing. Just warming your hands up.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.273
You're not a poof?

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.311
What gave you that impression?

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.833
Aren't me hands cold?

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.952
I quite like it.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.397
Just because I like ballet...

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.235
...doesn't mean I'm a poof, you know?

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.391
You won't tell anyone, will you?

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.798
Come on.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.631
It's fucking freezing in here.

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.828
Here.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.510
- What's this?
- Just put it on.

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.348
A tutu.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.799
- George, there's somebody in the club.
- This kangaroo...

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.632
...is wanking away over it, right...

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:17.154
...and he's called Norman.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.551
And then,
around the corner came this wallaby.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.588
<i>Plié,</i> first.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.474
- What's a <i>plié?</i>
- It's French.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.519
- Why is it French?
- I don't know. Second...

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.192
...like a princess.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.515
Second, and down.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.352
And first. Carry on. Fifth.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.994
Shoulders down. Long neck.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.555
How do I look?

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.517
- Shut up, you poof.
- Fuck off.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.429
Second, and down.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.870
And first.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.714
Fifth.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.919
Second.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.673
Down.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.279
First.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.590
Fifth.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.276
Jackie, man. Here.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.951
Give us your hand.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.272
Dance!

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.113
Dad!

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:30.872
Go home, son.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.636
Is this a friend of yours, then?

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.475
How much is it gonna cost?

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.670
And a happy Christmas to you, too.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.473
Not as much as you might think.
Maybe two grand.

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:11.718
- There's a good chance the Council's...
- Two grand?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.991
I was talking about the auditions.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.354
It's just a matter of the trip to London.

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:18.317
I'll give you the money for the fare.

01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:20.350
I didn't come here to be patronized.

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:23.000
No one's trying to patronize you.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:24.712
You're being ridiculous.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.791
- Am I?
- Yes.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.634
Thanks for everything you've done for Billy.

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.836
But he is my son, isn't he?

01:09:36.359 --> 01:09:38.237
<i>I'll handle this myself.</i>

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.879
- What?
- Thorpe.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.478
Is that the lot, then?

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.718
Fucking hell.
I never thought I'd see you down here.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.311
Things change, eh?

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.239
Right, you. Name?

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.633
Jackie Elliot.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.789
Glad to see you've come to your senses.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.791
Who's a big man now, eh?

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.910
Right. Okay, you lot, away!

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.429
All aboard the Skylark. Look lively.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.676
You can't smoke on here, mate.
These are private buses.

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.513
Scab, scab, scab!

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.312
Fuck off!

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.399
Dad!

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.238
Give us a hand.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.994
Dad!

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.711
What the fuck are you doing?

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.791
Dad, you can't go back, not now!

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.233
Look at the state of us!

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.629
- What've we got to offer that Billy?
- You can't!

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.393
Not now!
Not after everything we've been through!

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.913
It's for wee Billy!

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.195
He might be a fucking genius,
for all we know.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:52.636
For fuck's sake, Dad.
You can't do this, man! Dad!

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.677
He's only 11, for fuck's sake.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.588
He's a kid.

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.035
He's just a fucking little kid.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.152
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, son.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.079
- Please!
- I'm sorry, son.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.631
We're finished, son!

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.231
What choice have we got, eh?

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:18.358
- Let's give the boy a fucking chance!
- Please.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.358
Please don't do this to me, Dad.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.398
We'll find him some money.
We'll find it for him.

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.871
What the fuck is he doing?

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.469
It's okay. He's gonna be okay.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.796
Just get him out of here, Tony.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.035
Away. Leave it. Go on. Leave it.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.798
Let's go home, Dad.

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.792
Dad's right, you know?

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.958
Mom would have let you.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.509
All them 50 pences.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.748
It was a toss-up
between a new punch bag or you.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.990
It's not even enough
for the bed-and-breakfast.

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.116
Forget it, you're dreaming. Look at you.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.839
Fucking scrabbling round for 50 pences.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.632
You've got to do better than that.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.314
How?
I'm gonna have a raffle at the Welfare.

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.396
And I'm gonna organize a concert.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.038
Thanks, George.

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:26.559
Sheila's not got that kind of money.
She can't even keep the soup kitchen open.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.751
George said
we could have another whip-round.

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:32.230
There's no money left.
Get that through your head, man!

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.109
You know there's nothing left.
Stop putting ideas in his head, man!

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.308
Come on, lads! Dig deep for the miners.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.191
Is that absolutely necessary?

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.237
Walk normal, will you?

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.117
So what's it like, like?

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.713
What's what like?

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.473
London.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:44.279
I don't know, son.
I've never made it past Durham.

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.032
Have you never been, like?

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.197
- Why would I want to go to London?
- It's the capital city.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.274
- Well, there's no mines in London.
- Christ.

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.591
Is that all you think about?

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.553
Can I help you?

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:34.599
Billy Elliot. We've come for an audition.

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:37.792
You mean William Elliot?

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:41.156
- Yeah, William.
- Yes. Can you go upstairs, please?

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.037
- This way?
- Yes.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.473
Thanks.

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.357
- Is this your first time?
- Yeah.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.749
I've been doing this for two years now.

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.069
Hello.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.878
Nerve-racking, isn't it?

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.158
Where are you from?

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.751
Everington. County Durham.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.193
Durham? Isn't there an amazing cathedral?

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.196
I don't know. I've never been.

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.117
Up on the box, please.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.314
Right. Bend over. Right down.

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.313
And come up.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.194
Head down.

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.195
Tiny curvature here. Head down!

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:55.475
How tiny?

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:58.320
Might not be a problem.
Come on, keep coming.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.910
- Right. Jump up, William.
- It's Billy.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.479
Billy Elliot.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.548
Two, three, and four.

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.315
Dad!

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.713
Dad! Dad, for fuck's sake!

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.959
I've changed me mind.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.315
Get back in there. Don't be so stupid.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.031
And you are?

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.677
Billy Elliot from Everington.

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.990
- I beg your pardon?
- Billy Elliot.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.273
Yes, of course.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.508
Well, come to the bar, please, Billy.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.633
Left arm on the bar.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.119
Feet first.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.597
Arms second.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.513
<i>Demi-plié,</i> and hold.

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.993
Now, Billy...

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:42.954
...we'd like to see you move to music.
Do you have a piece prepared?

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.194
Thank you.

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:18.593
Are you all right?

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.472
- What's the matter?
- It was a waste of fucking time.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.672
Don't be upset. It's only a stupid audition.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.350
- It's all right.
- Fuck off.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.677
- There's always next year.
- Look, fuck off, will you?

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.836
You bent bastard!

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.557
What on earth's going on here?

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.038
How did it go?

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:00.913
Shit!

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:06.789
Mr. Elliot, I'm afraid that mutual respect
and self-discipline...

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:10.595
...are absolute prerequisites
for any pupil in this school.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.756
Such displays of violence...

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:16.071
...cannot be tolerated
under any circumstances. Understand?

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:20.072
I realize we shall have to consider
this very seriously...

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.914
...and it will be bound to affect
our final decision.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:28.478
Yes, well, just a few questions, then.

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:35.677
Can you tell us why you first
became interested in the ballet?

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.273
Don't know.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.233
Just was.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:52.439
Well, was there any particular aspect
of the ballet, which...

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.512
...caught your imagination?

01:23:58.240 --> 01:23:59.719
The dancing.

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:03.831
He dances all the time.
Every night, after school.

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:08.188
Yes, well,
we have a very enthusiastic letter from...

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.318
...Mrs. Wilkinson, and she has...

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.439
...told us of your personal circumstances.

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.239
Mr. Elliot, are you a fan of the ballet?

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:24.516
I wouldn't exactly say I was an expert.

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.638
You do realize that...

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:32.156
...all pupils must attain
the highest standards, not just in ballet...

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:35.118
...but in their ordinary academic work?

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:40.110
No child can succeed without
the 100 percent support of the family.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.596
You are completely behind Billy?

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.868
Are you not?

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.475
Yes.

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.593
Yes, of course.

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.830
Do you want to ask us any questions?

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:09.711
No, not really. No.

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:13.192
In that case...

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.874
...we shall let you know in due course.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.397
Just one last question.
Can I ask you, Billy:

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:29.515
What does it feel like when you're dancing?

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.679
Don't know.

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:44.393
Sort of feels good.

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.557
It's sort of stiff and that...

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.512
...but once I get going...

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:53.194
...then I, like, forget everything...

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.309
...and...

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.753
...sort of disappear.

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.798
I sort of disappear.

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.235
Like I feel a change in me whole body.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.236
Like there's a fire in me body.

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.233
I'm just there...

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.148
...flying...

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.637
...like a bird.

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:24.833
Like electricity.

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.833
Yeah...

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.432
...like electricity.

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.071
Have a safe journey home.

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:47.473
Mr. Elliot.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.877
Good luck with the strike.

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.479
Toast.

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.880
I think you should get yourself a trade, son.

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.153
Something useful.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.273
I could have been a professional dancer.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.110
What's happened to the dinosaurs, Miss?

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.838
They were crushed as well.

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:31.118
And the pressure of all of this
caused the plants and trees to change...

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:32.519
...into coal.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.591
That's what must have happened to her.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:37.319
Michael Caffrey,
if you have got something to say...

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.038
...you can say it to the class.

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.075
Sorry, Miss.

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.515
So, gradually...

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:45.114
...over hundreds of thousands of years...

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.553
Post!

01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.718
This is it.

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.871
- Have you heard anything yet?
- Not yet.

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.997
You'll have no problem, man.
Fingers crossed, eh?

01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:58.879
I got in.

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.791
He did it! He fucking did it!

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:23.151
Jackie, have you not heard, man?

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.556
We're going back.

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:30.155
Strike's over, Jackie.
The union caved in yesterday.

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.518
I think I'm scared, Dad.

01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.711
That's okay, son.

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.398
We're all scared.

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:49.916
Well, if I don't like it, can I still come back?

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.711
Are you kidding?

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.477
We've let out your room.

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:32.077
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:36.278
And one, two, three, four...

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:39.717
...five, six, seven.

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.917
Keep going, girls.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.828
Miss, I just came to tell you.

01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.988
It's all right, Billy, I heard it from Debbie.

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.995
Look, it was just...

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:07.478
Well, you know, after everything.

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:15.632
- I'll miss you, Miss.
- No, you won't.

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:17.517
I will. Honest.

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:21.029
This is when you go out and find life...

01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:24.394
...and all those other things.

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:29.037
The best of luck, Billy.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:38.469
Right. Back to the bar, girls. And again.

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:40.599
Thank you.

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.351
Debbie, eyes front.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.312
- Was she there?
- Yeah.

01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:00.238
- You'll miss the bus.
- I'll take it.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.239
- Give us the bag.
- Okay, right, no time for this.

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.629
Come on, I'll take that.

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:54.469
- Good-bye, Billy.
- See you.

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:09.635
Dancing boy!

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.637
- You'll miss your bus, Billy.
- Stop being an old fucking woman.

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.031
See you, then.

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.794
- I'll miss you!
- What? I can't hear you!

01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:57.153
Dad, come on, man. We're gonna be late.

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:15.154
Come on!

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:20.230
The show's just started.

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.759
Excuse me.

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.628
Can you tell Billy Elliot
that his family's here?

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:35.274
- Sorry, mate.
- It's all right, Tony.

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:40.274
It's me, Michael. Remember?

01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.114
It's Michael.

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:59.000
- What the bloody hell are you doing here?
- I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:08.633
Stand by, please.

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:37.909
- Billy, your family are here.
- Thanks.
