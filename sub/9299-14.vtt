<i>Hey.
Baby, will you buy me a drink?</i>

00:20.415 --> 00:22.675
<i>- No. Thank You.
- Whoa. Come on.</i>

00:25.133 --> 00:28.420
- Give it to me.
- It's my know.

00:30.039 --> 00:31.262
Aw!

00:32.570 --> 00:36.339
No! No one takes anything
else from me tonight!

00:36.374 --> 00:38.208
Take it, then, you little bitch!

01:07.238 --> 01:10.039
Ohh!

01:24.288 --> 01:26.623
- Now?
- No.

01:26.657 --> 01:30.260
I'm so tired, my taste buds are asleep.

01:30.294 --> 01:34.130
- What are we eating?
- A gluten-free almond cookie.

01:34.165 --> 01:35.432
Ah.

01:35.466 --> 01:37.400
So it's supposed to
taste like cardboard.

01:37.435 --> 01:40.703
Oh. Come on, Frankie!

01:40.738 --> 01:44.541
Maura and I put in an 18-hour day.
I want to go home!

01:44.575 --> 01:46.009
- Hold on!
- Oh, let him impress you.

01:46.043 --> 01:47.110
Okay, she's ready.

01:49.079 --> 01:50.647
Ta-da!

01:50.714 --> 01:51.915
- Whoa!
- Huh?

01:51.982 --> 01:54.050
What?!

01:54.084 --> 01:56.419
That looks amazing!

02:02.293 --> 02:03.960
Pop.

02:26.050 --> 02:27.450
<i>Why are you here?</i>

02:27.485 --> 02:29.252
I need a reason to see my family?

02:29.287 --> 02:33.356
We haven't heard from
you in over a year.

02:33.391 --> 02:35.191
- I'm sorry.
- We're gonna need more than that.

02:35.226 --> 02:36.860
Come on, guys. Give him a break.

02:36.927 --> 02:38.261
He just wanted to see the baby.

02:38.296 --> 02:40.397
Really? Well, I don't see the baby.
Do you, Frankie?

02:40.431 --> 02:44.834
I know I should have called, but,
uh, I wanted to surprise you kids.

02:44.869 --> 02:46.303
<i>Great. We love your surprises.</i>

02:46.337 --> 02:49.039
"Surprise!
I'm leaving your mother!"

02:49.073 --> 02:52.809
"Surprise!
I slept with Tommy's girlfriend!"

02:52.843 --> 02:56.179
<i>"Surprise!"
"I left all you guys holding the bag</i>

02:56.213 --> 02:59.015
when I stiffed the I.R.S.
to the tune of 27,000 bucks!"

02:59.050 --> 03:00.750
All right, all right, you know,

03:00.785 --> 03:03.086
could we not do this in
front of people, please?

03:03.120 --> 03:05.055
What pe... that's Maura!

03:05.089 --> 03:06.990
I'm gonna go make some tea.
Excuse me.

03:08.159 --> 03:11.928
- I'm here to speak to your mother.
- About what?

03:13.864 --> 03:15.298
I'll talk to you when
you're not with him.

03:15.333 --> 03:19.402
- Then you won't be talking.
- How you doing, Frank?

03:19.437 --> 03:21.571
How am I doing?
Better before I saw you.

03:21.605 --> 03:23.540
And what are you doing with my wife?

03:23.574 --> 03:26.810
Ex-wife, Frank.
And unless you're here

03:26.844 --> 03:31.414
to explain why you left me
holding the bag with the I.R.S.,

03:31.449 --> 03:35.018
I want you to leave!

03:37.588 --> 03:42.258
Pop, w-why don't you just leave, okay?

03:42.293 --> 03:43.839
Where are you staying at?

03:45.896 --> 03:49.966
I-I'm staying at the,
uh, Lighthouse motel.

03:50.034 --> 03:52.969
Okay, so, you know,
w-we'll talk tomorrow.

03:53.003 --> 03:56.106
"We"? Speak for yourself.

03:57.274 --> 04:03.079
Good night, Frank.
Kids, come inside for a cup of tea.

04:03.114 --> 04:05.115
- I'll see you later, Pop.
- Yeah.

04:11.222 --> 04:15.992
- I-I-I gotta go to work, okay?
- Y-you work too hard, Jane.

04:16.026 --> 04:19.028
Can you just go to the motel, please?

04:20.630 --> 04:23.333
<i>He has yet to apologize
for taking off to Florida</i>

04:23.367 --> 04:25.368
<i>and hooking up with a bunch of bimbos.</i>

04:25.403 --> 04:29.439
Well, apologizing is a major
threat to identity and self-esteem

04:29.507 --> 04:31.975
if you're someone who struggles
to manage strong emotions.

04:32.009 --> 04:34.277
Body's in the bathroom.

04:34.311 --> 04:37.914
Could be a robbery gone bad.
no sign of a wallet or cellphone.

04:37.948 --> 04:39.048
- No I.D.?
- No.

04:39.083 --> 04:41.284
- Who found her?
- Manager.

04:41.318 --> 04:44.354
People have been complaining for a while
that the john was out of order.

04:44.388 --> 04:48.625
So whoever killed her had
time to get out of here.

04:48.692 --> 04:52.996
- Did you find the weapon?
- No. But we got people looking for it.

04:53.030 --> 04:54.898
Okay.
Is this the victim's guitar?

04:54.932 --> 04:58.501
I think so. We're gonna dust the
guitar and the case for prints.

04:58.569 --> 05:03.206
Hey, Frost, give me a bag, would you?
Look at this.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.942
Looks like a piece of that
stuff they put in gift baskets.

05:06.911 --> 05:08.545
Definitely a guitar player.

05:08.612 --> 05:11.448
She has calluses on her left fingertips.

05:11.482 --> 05:13.283
Look at the velour.

05:13.317 --> 05:16.386
It's indented, like something
hard was hidden in the case.

05:16.420 --> 05:19.055
Well, if she brought a guitar,
she was planning on playing.

05:19.089 --> 05:21.891
- Did you see the lineup?
- Yeah, it's Camp fire night at the Argot.

05:21.959 --> 05:25.428
A bunch of female singer-songwriters.
But she doesn't look like anyone on it.

05:25.463 --> 05:27.430
They have an open mike
from 10:00 to 10:30.

05:27.465 --> 05:29.466
Penetration wound to the posterior

05:29.500 --> 05:33.369
between the fifth intercostal rib
and scapula and anterior

05:33.404 --> 05:36.439
between the fourth and fifth
ribs in the cardiac notch.

05:36.474 --> 05:38.107
Can you tell the murder
weapon we're looking for?

05:38.142 --> 05:39.409
Not until autopsy.

05:41.011 --> 05:42.111
That'll be after I get some sleep.

05:44.281 --> 05:45.248
Let's get her to the morgue.

05:47.084 --> 05:50.487
Sleep deprivation is as much
of an impairment as inebriation.

05:50.521 --> 05:52.489
I do not like to make mistakes.

05:52.523 --> 05:55.124
- Can you give me a hint?
- Oh, do I have to?

05:55.159 --> 05:58.061
What, do you want this
conversation to end and go to bed?

05:58.095 --> 06:01.130
Well, you are looking for
something with a sharp tip,

06:01.165 --> 06:02.665
although the wound is
not incised laterally.

06:02.733 --> 06:05.335
So, a knife with a
pointy tip and dull sides.

06:05.369 --> 06:08.338
- I didn't say a knife.
- We're looking for an SPT.

06:09.240 --> 06:13.576
- Sharp pointy thing.
- I am comfortable with that, yes.

06:13.611 --> 06:17.046
Everybody in here has a smartphone.
I'll call Frankie,

06:17.081 --> 06:18.481
get him to look at what's
been posted on Instagram,

06:18.516 --> 06:22.151
- Vine, Twitter, Snapchat...
- Stop, you're making me feel old.

06:22.186 --> 06:23.286
You are old.

06:23.520 --> 06:26.289
Okay. I guess we're done here.

06:36.100 --> 06:39.002
- What are you doing here?
- I needed to speak to you.

06:42.039 --> 06:44.641
Have you started drinking again?

06:44.675 --> 06:47.577
Yeah. I needed my old friend.

06:47.611 --> 06:52.015
What is it, the back-taxes thing?
What?

06:54.451 --> 06:56.052
I got cancer.

06:58.355 --> 07:01.424
<i>When did you find out?</i>

07:01.458 --> 07:04.561
A few weeks ago.
It's prostate.

07:07.331 --> 07:10.300
- How bad?
- They don't know yet.

07:10.367 --> 07:13.036
They sent me here for a
second opinion at mass general.

07:14.103 --> 07:17.307
- I'm sorry, Pop.
- Yeah.

07:17.341 --> 07:20.560
- Jane, I just want...
- Do you have any idea

07:20.561 --> 07:23.746
what you did to us,
what you did to Ma?

07:23.781 --> 07:27.617
I... look, it's hard for me to open up.

07:27.651 --> 07:31.387
Well, try.
You put your family through hell,

07:31.422 --> 07:34.357
and I for one would like to know why.

07:34.391 --> 07:36.059
You were a good Dad.

07:36.126 --> 07:39.729
We were a-a good family.
We had good times, right?

07:39.797 --> 07:41.364
Yes, we did.

07:41.432 --> 07:44.467
So, why ... why would
you sleep with Lydia?

07:44.535 --> 07:48.771
Why would you do that to Ma and
then just take off like that?

07:49.840 --> 07:54.677
Look, I loved your mother
for a long time.

07:54.712 --> 07:57.513
And when you kids were home
and the business was good,

07:57.548 --> 07:58.781
we were happy.

07:58.816 --> 08:01.584
<i>But then you guys grew up and left.</i>

08:01.619 --> 08:05.622
Business went bad, and
there was just me and her.

08:05.656 --> 08:09.659
I was just so unhappy, Janie.

08:10.693 --> 08:13.830
So you're only back because you need us.

08:13.864 --> 08:15.665
I was hoping that you need me, too.

08:18.102 --> 08:21.671
Look, Jane, would you tell
your mother about the cancer?

08:21.705 --> 08:23.873
<i>I need her, too.</i>

08:23.907 --> 08:26.843
And I know if it comes from
you, she won't turn me down.

08:26.877 --> 08:34.025
Pop, I can't.
I'll be here for you, okay? But...

08:34.061 --> 08:38.078
you got to ask her for forgiveness
before you can ask her for help.

08:45.368 --> 08:47.903
Oh, Jane. Come on in.

08:49.289 --> 08:51.290
Can I get you some tea?

08:51.324 --> 08:54.393
Uh, no, thanks.

08:54.427 --> 08:57.563
Why did he tell me?
Why do I always have to be the oldest?

08:57.630 --> 09:00.599
Prostate cancer is one of
the most survivable cancers

09:00.633 --> 09:03.602
if it doesn't spread.
Do you know what stage it's in?

09:03.670 --> 09:06.038
He didn't know.
I had to stop him

09:06.072 --> 09:07.873
when he started worrying
about his manhood.

09:07.907 --> 09:09.942
Well, the good news is
that 40% to 60% of men

09:09.976 --> 09:11.977
who were able to have
erections before surgery

09:12.011 --> 09:13.412
are able to after.

09:13.446 --> 09:16.782
Please, spare me that good news.

09:16.850 --> 09:20.986
Are there any visible
symptoms of prostate cancer?

09:21.054 --> 09:24.389
You know, like a prostate
limp or something?

09:24.424 --> 09:26.024
No, Jane. Why?

09:26.059 --> 09:31.029
It just... I'm not really
sure I believe he has cancer.

09:31.097 --> 09:32.865
Why would he lie?

09:32.932 --> 09:36.702
I don't know ...
to get sympathy, maybe.

09:38.304 --> 09:39.872
That's why he came back?

09:41.074 --> 09:43.408
He's sick, isn't he?

09:46.012 --> 09:49.448
And he wanted you to tell me, didn't he?

09:50.583 --> 09:55.821
Ma, he ... he told me
because he's afraid to tell you.

09:55.855 --> 09:57.623
He should be.

10:01.427 --> 10:03.328
What does he have?

10:05.465 --> 10:06.932
He has cancer, Ma.

10:10.069 --> 10:14.439
- Prostate cancer.
- I see.

10:15.775 --> 10:17.743
Okay.

10:19.812 --> 10:21.847
I'll deal with him.

10:21.915 --> 10:24.842
And I'll tell your brothers.

10:25.585 --> 10:29.454
You go home.
You get some sleep, okay?

10:29.489 --> 10:31.056
I'm sorry to dump this on you, Ma.

10:31.090 --> 10:33.625
You didn't, baby.
You didn't. He did.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.936
Thanks, Ma.

10:46.506 --> 10:49.041
<i>Where are we on the case?</i>

10:49.075 --> 10:52.978
<i>We I.D.'d the victim with her prints.</i>

10:53.012 --> 10:54.613
<i>She was 21,</i>

10:54.647 --> 10:56.848
a student at the Massachusetts
music conservatory.

10:58.484 --> 11:01.787
Natasha Osmanski.
Why were her prints on file?

11:01.821 --> 11:03.956
She was booked on a D.U.I.
charge six weeks ago.

11:03.990 --> 11:06.491
- It's still pending.
- Did you notify her parents?

11:06.526 --> 11:07.826
Told them early this morning.
It was rough.

11:07.860 --> 11:10.028
They're coming in later.
Dad's apparently famous.

11:10.063 --> 11:12.531
Apparently?
It's Alexi Osmanski.

11:12.565 --> 11:14.633
I know him. He was left
wing for the Bruins.

11:16.102 --> 11:19.171
Actually, he's a very famous
composer and conductor.

11:19.205 --> 11:21.907
All right, what about her stolen wallet,

11:21.941 --> 11:24.810
- and has anybody used her credit cards?
- Not yet. Flagged them all.

11:26.546 --> 11:28.547
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:28.615 --> 11:30.682
Anybody post any photos
online of our victim?

11:30.717 --> 11:33.552
Tons of postings, but I haven't
seen any photos of her yet.

11:33.586 --> 11:36.388
- I'll keep checking.
- Yeah.

11:36.422 --> 11:37.656
She doesn't have a facebook page.

11:37.690 --> 11:40.792
- Even I have a facebook page.
- With three friends.

11:40.860 --> 11:43.829
- I'll be your friend.
- You already are.

11:43.863 --> 11:45.831
All right, Maura's doing the autopsy.

11:45.865 --> 11:48.400
Uh, call me when the
parents get here, okay?

11:52.572 --> 11:54.873
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:54.941 --> 11:56.842
Stomach contents ... smell them.

11:56.876 --> 12:00.679
Ooh. You know my policy.
Unless that bile stew

12:00.713 --> 12:02.681
can help me track her movements
before she was stabbed,

12:02.715 --> 12:03.982
I do not sniff.

12:04.017 --> 12:05.784
I just thought you
would recognize vanilla.

12:05.818 --> 12:07.586
What, she had a drink
with vanilla in it?

12:07.620 --> 12:10.922
I don't know if it was a drink,
but her blood-alcohol level was 0.06.

12:10.957 --> 12:13.692
So that's one or two
drinks for a girl her size.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.127
What about her tox screen?

12:15.161 --> 12:17.229
Clean for common
prescription and street drugs.

12:17.263 --> 12:19.131
Okay, talk to me about
the murder weapon.

12:19.165 --> 12:22.834
Still unclear, but I did check
the, uh, toolmark database.

12:22.902 --> 12:25.537
There are hundreds of possibilities ...

12:25.571 --> 12:28.206
<i>knives, daggers,</i>

12:28.241 --> 12:31.610
letter openers, nail
clippers, and bayonets,

12:31.678 --> 12:33.445
- stilettos.
- Stiletto shoes?

12:33.513 --> 12:36.888
- Yes, and stiletto blades.
- Maura, you were supposed

12:36.923 --> 12:38.550
to narrow it down and not tell me

12:38.618 --> 12:40.952
we're still looking for
a sharp pointy thing.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.220
What's with the black stuff on the swab?

12:42.288 --> 12:46.058
Oh, I found it when I
swabbed the posterior entry wound.

12:46.125 --> 12:48.760
I was just about to
give it to the crime lab.

12:48.795 --> 12:52.230
- You didn't sleep, did you?
- No, not much.

12:52.265 --> 12:55.200
- Cavanaugh knows.
- Well, of course he does.

12:55.268 --> 12:56.668
He and your mother are a couple.

12:56.736 --> 12:59.738
I mean, it's not like I want my parents

12:59.772 --> 13:00.972
to get back together, but...

13:02.108 --> 13:06.478
Mnh-mnh. You don't think
it's icky that my boss is...

13:06.512 --> 13:07.913
<i>sleeping with my mother?</i>

13:07.947 --> 13:10.749
No. But I-I can see why you do.

13:10.817 --> 13:12.884
You're never
old enough to hear the details

13:12.919 --> 13:14.086
of your mother's sex life.

13:16.556 --> 13:19.091
Ma just told Tommy and Frankie
she needs moral support.

13:19.125 --> 13:21.093
Got a hit on the victim's credit card.

13:21.127 --> 13:23.161
Guy was using it right down
the street at a 7-eleven.

13:23.229 --> 13:25.831
- They've taken him to interrogation.
- Great. Let's go talk to him.

13:25.865 --> 13:28.066
Uh, Jane.
What about your mother?

13:28.101 --> 13:31.703
- I have an interrogation to do.
- No.

13:31.738 --> 13:32.971
- No?
- You can't, Jane.

13:33.005 --> 13:34.639
Go take care of your mother.

13:34.674 --> 13:37.811
- But he's a suspect, Vince.
- And Frost and I n handle him.

13:43.282 --> 13:46.284
- Where'd you get that shiner?
- What shiner?

13:46.319 --> 13:48.920
I'm guessing it happened when you
took Natasha Osmanski's wallet.

13:48.955 --> 13:51.223
- Who?
- More like, "what?"

13:53.659 --> 13:55.694
Dumb move to leave it in
your glove compartment, Wayne.

13:55.762 --> 13:58.163
No idea how it got there.

13:58.197 --> 14:00.065
This isn't a picture of
you using her credit card?

14:00.099 --> 14:03.869
- It sure looks like you.
- Hey, man, she gave me that card.

14:03.903 --> 14:07.005
Oh, now she gave it to you.
Was that right before you murdered her?

14:07.039 --> 14:09.541
You two be tripping.

14:09.575 --> 14:12.577
<i>We were talking.
She was into me.</i>

14:12.612 --> 14:14.312
She gave me that card
to buy us some drinks.

14:14.347 --> 14:15.947
When I came back, she was gone.

14:15.982 --> 14:18.316
We checked.
Her card was not used at that bar.

14:18.351 --> 14:21.253
<i>So...</i>

14:21.287 --> 14:25.323
are you ready to stop
wasting our time here?

14:25.391 --> 14:28.760
Okay, I took it.
All right?

14:28.795 --> 14:32.197
- But that bitch was crazy.
- Before or after you stabbed her?

14:32.231 --> 14:35.634
I didn't stab her.
I was just playing around.

14:35.668 --> 14:37.335
But she started freaking out.

14:37.370 --> 14:39.304
"No one else is taking
anything from me tonight!"

14:39.338 --> 14:42.073
Maybe because you took her wallet.

14:42.108 --> 14:43.341
No, that was after she hauled off

14:43.376 --> 14:44.843
and hit me with her guitar case, dude.

14:44.877 --> 14:48.046
So you followed her to the
ladies' room, and you stabbed her.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.314
No.

14:49.348 --> 14:52.150
All right, the wallet was on the floor,
so, yeah, I kept it.

14:52.185 --> 14:54.653
<i>A little payback for smashing my face.</i>

14:54.687 --> 14:55.954
I'm the victim here.

14:57.824 --> 15:01.059
- Take off your clothes, Wayne.
- Oh, I don't swing that way, boys.

15:01.093 --> 15:05.297
Now you "be tripping," dude.

15:05.331 --> 15:07.833
<i>We're looking for Natasha's
blood on your clothes.</i>

15:07.867 --> 15:09.334
- Strip.
- I don't need to watch this.

15:09.368 --> 15:11.670
I've seen it before.

15:11.704 --> 15:16.141
- Hey! You can't do this!
- Oh, hey, sorry, forgot to mention.

15:16.209 --> 15:19.911
You're under arrest ...
for larceny and forgery.

15:19.946 --> 15:21.780
Now take off your clothes.

15:24.283 --> 15:26.852
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:26.886 --> 15:30.689
- It's gonna be okay, right, Jane?
- I don't know, Tommy.

15:30.723 --> 15:33.625
Let's get all the
information first, okay?

15:33.659 --> 15:36.194
Yeah, you know, we
can't control the cancer,

15:36.229 --> 15:37.629
so let's just help Ma.

15:37.663 --> 15:39.097
And if she wants to be there for him,

15:39.131 --> 15:42.000
whether he deserves it or not,
then we be there for Ma.

15:44.003 --> 15:44.970
What are you doing here?

15:45.004 --> 15:47.806
I'm taking your father
to his oncology appointment.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.075
Your mother's been a godsend.

15:51.410 --> 15:52.844
That's too bad you
just figured that out.

15:52.879 --> 15:54.045
You're wrecking it.
Would you stop?

15:54.080 --> 15:55.714
Will you stop, Tommy?

15:55.748 --> 15:58.149
Listen, I know I don't
deserve your forgiveness.

15:58.184 --> 16:00.719
All I'm asking for is
one last family dinner

16:00.786 --> 16:01.920
before it's too late.

16:01.954 --> 16:03.421
- Please.
- Okay, fine.

16:03.456 --> 16:06.124
We'll do it at Maura's tonight, okay?

16:06.158 --> 16:08.226
Ma, you can't ask Maura to do that.

16:08.294 --> 16:11.229
Let's do it at Mario's.
You know, just us family.

16:12.231 --> 16:15.667
Family?
Maura is family.

16:15.701 --> 16:20.038
She took me in when I had no
place to live after you left me.

16:20.072 --> 16:22.407
<i>And you want our support?</i>

16:22.441 --> 16:26.411
Well, it has to be done
my way with my family.

16:28.314 --> 16:31.182
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:31.217 --> 16:33.385
All right, let's go to the doctor.

16:33.419 --> 16:35.053
Call me when you're done, okay?

16:35.087 --> 16:36.888
- Yeah, listen, I was wondering.
- Can you just...?

16:36.923 --> 16:41.126
- Damn it.
- Well, what's the matter?

16:41.193 --> 16:43.395
We can't tie the guy who
took our victim's credit cards

16:43.429 --> 16:45.864
to her murder, so we can
only charge him with larceny.

16:48.401 --> 16:51.503
I was wondering if you kids want
to come to the doctor with me.

16:51.537 --> 16:53.104
Yeah, Pop. Y-yeah.

16:56.275 --> 16:59.965
Frankie and I got to get
back to work, Pop. Sorry.

17:01.047 --> 17:02.047
Back to work.

17:04.784 --> 17:07.752
Okay. Sure.

17:07.787 --> 17:10.454
<i>Come on.</i>

17:15.194 --> 17:19.763
- We should go with them.
- Yeah, we should.

17:33.007 --> 17:36.543
- I have results.
- Dr. Isles, you seen Jane?

17:36.578 --> 17:38.646
Uh, she just texted me.
She's looking for Angela.

17:38.713 --> 17:40.648
- What happened with Frank?
- I don't know.

17:40.715 --> 17:42.583
She said to get started without her.

17:42.617 --> 17:44.852
<i>So, the black, gritty
substance I found in the wound</i>

17:44.920 --> 17:46.754
was transferred from the weapon.

17:46.788 --> 17:49.957
<i>It's keratin hydrolysates,
acetate nitrocellulose,</i>

17:49.991 --> 17:52.159
<i>- and zinc sulfide.
- I hear "fingernails" in there.</i>

17:52.193 --> 17:54.662
- Was the rest of it nail polish?
- Black nail polish ... very good.

17:54.696 --> 17:56.096
So the killer was a woman.

17:56.131 --> 17:58.866
<i>You might want to update
the era you're living in.</i>

17:58.900 --> 18:01.769
- Guys wear nail polish now.
- Some guys.

18:01.803 --> 18:02.870
So what's the weapon? A nail file?

18:02.904 --> 18:05.606
Possibly.
A steel eight-inch nail file

18:05.640 --> 18:07.074
is consistent with the wound tracks.

18:07.108 --> 18:08.876
Sounds like a crime of opportunity.

18:08.910 --> 18:10.811
Girl in a bar goes to the ladies' room.

18:10.879 --> 18:12.713
She's attacked and stabbed to death

18:12.747 --> 18:14.615
with what could have been a nail file.

18:14.649 --> 18:16.250
<i>Only real motive we have</i>

18:16.284 --> 18:18.953
is she had something in her
guitar case the killer wanted.

18:18.987 --> 18:21.722
I wish I could tell you
what made that indentation.

18:21.756 --> 18:24.692
All I know for sure was
that it was a hard cylinder,

18:24.726 --> 18:27.594
roughly 10 inches tall
with a 5-inch circumference.

18:27.629 --> 18:30.331
- Could be a lot of things.
- What about stomach contents?

18:30.365 --> 18:33.667
Mostly bile, but we were able
to identify althea officinalis.

18:33.735 --> 18:35.910
It's a marshmallow root.

18:35.945 --> 18:37.604
That bar serve marshmallow root?

18:37.639 --> 18:40.941
Uh...
they don't serve much.

18:40.976 --> 18:43.711
No, I'm not seeing anything
with marshmallows in it.

18:43.778 --> 18:45.913
So she was somewhere
else before the bar.

18:45.981 --> 18:48.782
You know, althea officinalis
is also an herbal remedy

18:48.817 --> 18:52.753
for gastrointestinal distress,
colitis, and urinary-tract infection.

18:52.787 --> 18:55.723
Did she have any of those... issues?

18:55.757 --> 18:59.727
I have ordered her medical records.
And they are on their way.

19:09.671 --> 19:11.071
You want to talk?

19:14.042 --> 19:16.009
Is it bad, Ma?

19:17.078 --> 19:20.214
It looks bad, honey.

19:33.795 --> 19:36.063
<i>Victim's parents are here.</i>

19:36.097 --> 19:39.433
<i>- Your daughter was adopted, then?
- Yes.</i>

19:39.467 --> 19:42.169
There were so many
unwanted babies in Russia.

19:42.203 --> 19:43.804
We fell in love with her.

19:43.838 --> 19:49.810
We didn't know it would be
so hard for her ... for us.

19:49.844 --> 19:53.247
Like many orphans,
Natasha had an attachment disorder.

19:53.281 --> 19:57.718
By the time she was 3,
Alexi realized she was a music prodigy.

19:57.752 --> 20:00.387
One time she was on my lap,

20:00.422 --> 20:05.392
and I missed a chord.
And she says, "you missed one, papa."

20:05.427 --> 20:08.262
And she plays "E" major for me.

20:08.296 --> 20:11.198
<i>Perfectly.</i>

20:11.232 --> 20:14.268
- And she continued to play piano?
- Uh, yes, yes.

20:14.302 --> 20:16.904
She was, uh, awarded a scholarship.

20:16.938 --> 20:19.339
At the Massachusetts
conservatory of music.

20:19.407 --> 20:21.108
That's very prestigious.

20:23.064 --> 20:27.014
- When did she add guitar?
- Guitar?

20:27.082 --> 20:30.838
She didn't play guitar.

20:31.386 --> 20:33.821
Did you know your
daughter had been arrested

20:33.855 --> 20:35.389
For driving under the influence?

20:35.423 --> 20:39.159
- Yes.
- It was my fault she drank.

20:39.194 --> 20:42.463
- I push her.
- No, we ... we both did.

20:43.428 --> 20:45.232
<i>She was so shy.</i>

20:45.266 --> 20:48.902
I-I think she drank because
she was terrified to perform.

20:50.004 --> 20:51.839
Her, uh, doctor suggested

20:51.873 --> 20:55.209
she enter an
addiction-treatment program.

20:55.243 --> 20:58.145
<i>That's where she's
been for the past month.</i>

20:58.179 --> 21:00.380
Stanza rehab center.
She was there yesterday?

21:00.415 --> 21:01.915
That's what we thought,

21:01.983 --> 21:03.984
but apparently they were
allowing her to leave.

21:04.018 --> 21:06.420
Did she have a cellphone
or a computer in rehab?

21:06.454 --> 21:08.755
Uh, we kept her phone.
Stanza didn't allow it.

21:08.790 --> 21:10.991
And she wasn't allowed use
of the internet, either.

21:11.025 --> 21:13.927
- But she had a computer?
- For school work, yes.

21:13.962 --> 21:18.499
- Did Natasha have a boyfriend?
- No.

21:18.533 --> 21:22.169
- How about friends?
- She was never good at making friends.

21:23.304 --> 21:26.940
I-I can't
imagine her going to a bar.

21:27.008 --> 21:29.943
She brought a guitar to the bar.
Why would she do that?

21:29.978 --> 21:33.445
It doesn't make sense.
She didn't play.

21:34.048 --> 21:37.919
- She wouldn't go to a bar.
- But she was there, Alexi.

21:38.920 --> 21:40.854
Oh, god, how did we get it so wrong?

21:42.777 --> 21:46.260
We are both so sorry for your loss.

21:50.331 --> 21:51.565
What the hell?

21:51.599 --> 21:52.966
"I cannot confirm or deny."

21:53.001 --> 21:54.501
"I cannot confirm or deny."

21:54.536 --> 21:57.751
Stanza rehab won't even
confirm Natasha was a patient.

21:57.786 --> 21:59.359
We're gonna need a
warrant to get her records.

21:59.394 --> 22:02.376
I've been going through her wallet.
She had a Boston city all-transit pass.

22:02.410 --> 22:04.845
- Victim had a B-cat pass?
- Everything okay?

22:04.879 --> 22:08.812
No. But thanks for asking.

22:09.050 --> 22:11.485
Okay, uh, did you trace the pass?

22:11.519 --> 22:13.579
Yeah, it's just coming up.

22:14.455 --> 22:18.225
Okay, this is weird.
She only took the green line,

22:18.259 --> 22:21.228
and she only got on and off
at one station ... Symphony.

22:21.296 --> 22:24.164
- She rode around in circles?
- Maybe she never left the station.

22:24.232 --> 22:26.970
Yeah, there are a lot of
buskers in that subway station.

22:27.005 --> 22:29.436
- What the hell is a busker?
- It's a street performer.

22:29.470 --> 22:31.205
I hear the good ones can
make like 700 bucks a day.

22:31.239 --> 22:32.839
We are in the wrong line of work.

22:32.874 --> 22:35.275
- Hey, you need to have a talent.
- I got talent.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.244
One that people will pay to see.

22:37.278 --> 22:39.346
B-cat transit makes
you register with them

22:39.414 --> 22:42.216
and issues a performer permit
and I.D. badge, don't they?

22:42.250 --> 22:44.418
- Yeah.
- I'll check to see if she had a permit.

22:44.452 --> 22:47.254
<i>Her mom said she was terrified
of performing, though.</i>

22:47.288 --> 22:49.456
Apparently that's what
began the drinking.

22:49.490 --> 22:51.391
Nope, she wasn't registered.

22:51.459 --> 22:53.327
Hey, maybe we need to
check out "American Idol."

22:53.361 --> 22:55.362
That's where kids go to get
discovered nowadays, right?

22:55.396 --> 22:58.832
No, man. You blog and post
and try to get yourself

22:58.866 --> 23:00.867
on one of the big music
sites, like Pitchfork.

23:00.902 --> 23:03.070
Pitchfork?
What kind of name is that?

23:03.104 --> 23:04.638
A review on that blog

23:04.672 --> 23:07.407
is like making the cover of
Rolling Stonin' your day.

23:09.143 --> 23:11.845
Her parents said she didn't play guitar.

23:11.879 --> 23:14.548
Those calluses on her
fingers say different.

23:14.582 --> 23:17.568
Doesn't play guitar, doesn't
drink, and yet we find her

23:17.569 --> 23:20.554
dead in a bar with alcohol in
her system and with a guitar.

23:20.588 --> 23:23.023
Yeah, on a night with
a half-hour of open mike

23:23.091 --> 23:26.260
- for female singer-songwriters.
- She was there to sing.

23:26.294 --> 23:29.496
Odds are she was in Symphony
station to sing, too.

23:29.530 --> 23:31.198
Maybe our shy, friendless
classical musician

23:31.232 --> 23:32.232
was leading a double life.

23:32.267 --> 23:33.900
Frost, can you do a search

23:33.935 --> 23:36.057
to see if she posted
anything with her singing?

23:40.041 --> 23:41.041
No, nothing using her name.

23:41.075 --> 23:45.245
<i>I'm gonna try "girl,
Symphony station, guitar."</i>

23:45.280 --> 23:47.948
Yeah, here's something
somebody else posted.

23:47.982 --> 23:49.483
<i>Let's see what it is.</i>

23:52.154 --> 23:57.024
<i>♪ ...and I've got scars and

23:57.091 --> 23:58.258
<i>♪ to remind me ♪</i>

23:58.293 --> 24:01.561

24:06.501 --> 24:08.268
Nice lyrics.

24:08.303 --> 24:11.338
<i>♪ no one else can make as... ♪</i>

24:11.372 --> 24:14.908
<i>- Hey, bitch, that's my spot!
- Hey, leave her alone!</i>

24:14.942 --> 24:17.444
<i>Hey, mind your own business!
And don't let me catch you here again!</i>

24:17.478 --> 24:21.148
<i>- This is my spot!
- I'm so sorry.</i>

24:21.215 --> 24:23.450
We need to find that guy.

24:35.172 --> 24:36.973
<i>Hey, Delroy, you got a minute?</i>

24:37.041 --> 24:38.308
The name's Busta Bucket.

24:38.342 --> 24:40.910
<i>Put some money in, and
I might talk to you.</i>

24:40.945 --> 24:44.380
- I thought your name was Delroy.
- Yeah. Delroy King?

24:44.415 --> 24:46.983
You did 10 years at
Walpole for manslaughter.

24:47.017 --> 24:50.053
You five-oh?

24:50.087 --> 24:53.223
I'm cool.
I got my performance license.

24:53.290 --> 24:55.191
Which is for inside the
subway at your assigned spot,

24:55.226 --> 24:56.793
not out here on the public street.

24:56.827 --> 24:58.294
How come you left your spot down below?

24:58.329 --> 25:00.964
Come on, man. This is hard work.
It's hot down there.

25:00.998 --> 25:02.957
<i>Where were you last
night from 9:00 to 10:00?</i>

25:02.992 --> 25:06.346
With my old lady, banging
a different kind of drum.

25:06.381 --> 25:10.774
Yeah.
You know this girl?

25:10.841 --> 25:11.574
No.

25:11.609 --> 25:15.411
<i>Mind your own business!
And don't let me catch you here again!</i>

25:15.446 --> 25:16.780
<i>This is my spot!</i>

25:16.814 --> 25:18.214
She came back, didn't she?

25:18.249 --> 25:19.315
That's why you followed
her and stabbed her.

25:19.350 --> 25:21.017
Hell, no! I didn't stab her!

25:21.051 --> 25:23.887
I tried to scare her off, but...
the girl could sing.

25:23.921 --> 25:27.157
<i>So I let her work my spot,
and she gave me some of the money.</i>

25:27.191 --> 25:30.160
- Well, she's dead now, Delroy.
- I didn't touch that girl!

25:30.227 --> 25:31.361
All right, pack up your buckets.

25:31.395 --> 25:33.196
What?
Nah, I can't leave my station.

25:33.230 --> 25:35.116
Yeah, you can. You're gonna
come down to our station

25:35.151 --> 25:37.467
till we can check out your story.
Let's go.

25:40.838 --> 25:42.572
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:42.606 --> 25:44.774
Oh, is this the crinkled paper
I found in her guitar case?

25:44.808 --> 25:48.311
You know, the crime lab found
traces of cacao-bean extract on it.

25:48.345 --> 25:50.313
- Chocolate?
- Yeah.

25:50.347 --> 25:53.716
Where was she between rehab and the bar?

25:53.750 --> 25:56.486
And what was she hiding
in the guitar case?

25:58.755 --> 26:00.223
What about Mr. Bucket?

26:00.257 --> 26:03.226
Dead end.
Busta's alibi checks out.

26:03.260 --> 26:06.829
He was with his old lady.
The neighbors saw him come home.

26:06.897 --> 26:10.800
What if this is just some random
killing that we can't solve?

26:10.834 --> 26:13.336
- Don't say that.
- Well, I mean,

26:13.370 --> 26:14.804
there are a lot of homicide departments

26:14.838 --> 26:16.606
that have piles of unsolved
cases like this one.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.342
Why are you talking like this?

26:22.479 --> 26:25.715
My father's PSA numbers came back,
and they're through the roof.

26:25.749 --> 26:29.318
It's not a-a very reliable test.

26:29.386 --> 26:31.821
Numbers can rise with a
routine prostate examination

26:31.855 --> 26:34.724
or even digital stimulation
during sexual experimentation.

26:34.758 --> 26:38.427
- Maura, stop.
- Have they done his ultrasound yet?

26:38.462 --> 26:40.196
It's tomorrow.

26:40.230 --> 26:41.731
You want to come over for dinner?

26:41.798 --> 26:44.400
Crap, I was gonna ask
you the same thing.

26:44.434 --> 26:46.602
What does that mean?

26:49.973 --> 26:51.374
I'm so sorry.

26:52.876 --> 26:55.278
Tuna casserole.

26:55.345 --> 26:59.482
<i>Vienna sausage wrapped in
bacon with water chestnuts.</i>

26:59.550 --> 27:01.584
Jello mold, Boston cream pie.

27:01.618 --> 27:06.389
- Um, where are the vegetables?
- Right here. Canned corn.

27:06.423 --> 27:10.931
Frank's favorite.
We'll eat extra kale tomorrow.

27:14.264 --> 27:16.265
How hard is it to remember
where the fork goes?

27:16.300 --> 27:17.733
I'll show you where the fork goes.

27:17.801 --> 27:20.236
Boys, knock it off!

27:20.270 --> 27:21.904
Our guests are gonna be here any minute.

27:21.939 --> 27:23.706
Wait. Guests, plural?

27:24.808 --> 27:26.642
<i>I'll get it.</i>

27:27.945 --> 27:29.712
Hey, Pop.

27:29.746 --> 27:31.214
- Hey.
- How you doing?

27:31.248 --> 27:32.515
All right.

27:32.549 --> 27:33.950
- How's my boy? All right?
- I'm good.

27:33.984 --> 27:37.253
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi.

27:37.287 --> 27:40.523
- Nice flowers, huh, Ma?
- Yeah. Thanks.

27:40.557 --> 27:41.891
- Hi.
- Blue carnations?

27:41.959 --> 27:45.869
They're actually white.
But dip them in blue dye,

27:45.871 --> 27:47.847
with capillary action, you get that.

27:47.882 --> 27:50.733
<i>Listen, I don't think
this is a good idea tonight.</i>

27:50.767 --> 27:52.902
Well, it's one bottle for six people.

27:52.936 --> 27:54.237
It's all right. Come on.

27:54.271 --> 27:55.571
<i> It's okay.</i>

27:55.639 --> 27:59.675
- Who's that?
- I told you we're gonna do things my way.

28:03.447 --> 28:05.414
- Hey.
- Hi, honey.

28:05.449 --> 28:06.549
Hi.

28:06.617 --> 28:08.751
<i>Thank you.</i>

28:20.597 --> 28:24.000
Well, uh, we certainly
have an interesting case

28:24.034 --> 28:26.569
that we're working on,
don't we, Jane?

28:26.603 --> 28:30.673
Yeah. Uh... yeah, why don't
you tell them about it?

28:30.741 --> 28:34.343
- Um, well, it's tragic, really.
- I'll say.

28:34.411 --> 28:37.413
The case.
I mean, the victim.

28:37.447 --> 28:38.781
She was a child prodigy.

28:38.815 --> 28:41.917
I was a prodigy.
I could skate backwards when I was 3.

28:43.587 --> 28:46.455
That was me skating
backwards holding you up.

28:46.490 --> 28:48.024
Oh.

28:48.058 --> 28:50.693
You were no prodigy.

28:50.727 --> 28:52.528
He ... he was like an idiot savant.

28:52.562 --> 28:54.630
But that was because of
the way he could play chess.

28:54.698 --> 28:57.633
Useless at everything else.

28:58.435 --> 28:59.935
Tommy did a lot of things well, Pop.

29:02.039 --> 29:03.539
And Frankie here ... see this kid?

29:03.573 --> 29:06.042
This kid had a million-dollar arm.

29:06.076 --> 29:07.777
I thought you'd be
playing for the Red Sox.

29:07.844 --> 29:11.747
- Yeah. Me too.
- He kept whining about his sore elbow.

29:11.782 --> 29:15.584
Want to know why?
You know what coach Tony said?

29:15.619 --> 29:17.653
- Tommy, don't waste your breath.
- No, I'm gonna say it.

29:17.721 --> 29:19.789
You made him throw so many curve
balls, he threw his arm out.

29:19.823 --> 29:22.949
Nah. He was a quitter!

29:23.860 --> 29:26.562
And you.
Be honest, you babied him.

29:26.596 --> 29:28.931
Frank, you know what
alcohol does to your tongue.

29:31.468 --> 29:32.735
Don't embarrass me here.

29:32.769 --> 29:36.972
- It's okay. I'm sober.
- I'm sober, too, Frank.

29:37.007 --> 29:40.976
<i>It's okay, Pop.
We all know what alcohol does to you.</i>

29:41.011 --> 29:45.147
Yeah, and for the record, uh,
Frankie is a great Detective.

29:45.182 --> 29:49.018
<i>And Tommy is a great father.</i>

29:49.052 --> 29:53.422
You know, on that note,
I got to go see my kid.

29:53.457 --> 29:55.791
Yeah.
I'm gonna get out of here, too.

29:55.826 --> 29:58.067
<i>Thanks for dinner, Ma.</i>

30:00.797 --> 30:01.864
Hey. Hey, I...

30:03.500 --> 30:05.000
<i>Hey, I was just busting balls.</i>

30:05.068 --> 30:06.936
I'm just kidding!

30:06.970 --> 30:09.939
<i>Where you going?!
I'm busting balls!</i>

30:10.006 --> 30:12.608
- I think I should go, too.
- I'll walk you out.

30:12.642 --> 30:15.911
No, let him go!
I want to talk to my wife.

30:15.946 --> 30:18.080
But she's not your wife no more, Frank.

30:18.115 --> 30:20.649
And you're gonna show
some respect starting now.

30:20.684 --> 30:22.151
Yeah, come on.
You gonna make me?!

30:22.185 --> 30:24.387
- Yeah...
- No, no! Come on. Stop it!

30:24.454 --> 30:25.921
- Stop it! Pop, stop!
- Come on!

30:25.956 --> 30:28.157
- Let me take you to the motel, okay?
- Look at yourself, Frank.

30:28.191 --> 30:30.593
<i>Okay? Come on. Come on.</i>

30:30.660 --> 30:32.061
<i>Come on. Let's go to the motel.</i>

30:32.129 --> 30:34.816
- Just like I thought. You're a coward.
- That's it, Frank...

30:34.851 --> 30:37.236
- No, stop it!
- Stop. Sean.

30:37.271 --> 30:39.101
- Please, Daddy...
- Go ahead, hurt Angela again.

30:39.136 --> 30:41.137
It won't be the prostate
that kills you, Frank.

30:41.204 --> 30:42.571
- Sean, come o...
- Please, Daddy. Please.

30:42.606 --> 30:45.007
- Just get him out of here!
- Just stop!

30:45.041 --> 30:46.008
<i>Pop, come on.</i>

30:48.812 --> 30:49.845
I'm sorry.

30:54.518 --> 30:59.522
You know, all that crap that
you say to Tommy and Frankie ...

30:59.556 --> 31:04.602
you can't ever take that back, Pop!

31:05.652 --> 31:09.458
I'm sorry, Maura.

31:16.298 --> 31:17.231
Psst.

31:19.284 --> 31:22.944
Coffee?
Danish?

31:22.979 --> 31:27.624
- What's the occasion?
- We just want you to know we care.

31:27.659 --> 31:29.347
Thank you.

31:29.794 --> 31:31.929
My Dad's an asshole, too.

31:32.681 --> 31:34.315
Okay, well, let's get back to work

31:34.350 --> 31:36.718
so I don't spend the day
in the fetal position.

31:36.785 --> 31:41.656
Frost, you said the creep that
stole Natasha's credit card

31:41.724 --> 31:44.229
said she was upset about
having other things taken?

31:44.247 --> 31:46.399
Yeah.
He said she said something about,

31:46.529 --> 31:48.197
"nobody else is taking
anything from me tonight."

31:48.231 --> 31:50.032
Could she have meant
something other than her purse?

31:50.566 --> 31:51.867
<i>Well, now we're talking.</i>

31:51.934 --> 31:54.569
We just got a warrant to dig
through Natasha's stay at Stanza.

31:54.604 --> 31:56.338
Let's take a ride to rehab.

32:00.643 --> 32:03.545
I'm not happy to be
presented with a warrant

32:03.579 --> 32:05.046
with such a broad scope.

32:05.114 --> 32:07.949
It's one thing to
invade Natasha's privacy.

32:08.017 --> 32:10.452
This is a homicide investigation.

32:10.486 --> 32:13.522
But Natasha wasn't killed here.
Check the visitors log.

32:13.556 --> 32:18.360
- She signed out at 7:35 P.M.
- Thank you. I think we will.

32:18.427 --> 32:20.996
If you don't allow cellphones
or access to the internet here

32:21.030 --> 32:22.731
why would you allow your patients

32:22.765 --> 32:24.566
to come and go at their own will?

32:24.600 --> 32:27.435
We provide structure here,
but we also provide freedom.

32:27.470 --> 32:30.605
- It's not a prison.
- Are Natasha's things still in her room?

32:30.673 --> 32:32.908
Yes.

32:35.545 --> 32:38.480
Oh, I got her computer.

32:46.355 --> 32:48.423
This doesn't get played much.

32:48.457 --> 32:50.559
Does that mean something?

32:50.626 --> 32:52.994
I don't think it's Natasha's guitar.

32:55.631 --> 32:57.065
<i>Her action was set up perfectly.</i>

32:57.099 --> 33:00.001
This one, the action's
wrong. It's high, uneven.

33:01.037 --> 33:02.771
Wow.

33:04.140 --> 33:06.541
Holy crap.
Where'd you learn to play like that?

33:07.576 --> 33:08.977
I taught myself.

33:09.011 --> 33:10.979
You could make real money on the subway.

33:11.013 --> 33:14.549
Then I wouldn't get to
look at you all day long.

33:15.551 --> 33:20.889
- Um, did Natasha have a roommate?
- Kelsey's in the music room.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.724
She's leading Natasha's
memorial service.

33:25.995 --> 33:30.398
♪ I found my rose in a hungry soul ♪

33:30.466 --> 33:33.835
<i>♪ and I've seen troubles

33:33.869 --> 33:37.839

33:39.642 --> 33:41.843
<i>It's the same song Natasha
was singing in the subway.</i>

33:41.877 --> 33:43.912
Natasha had a much better voice, though.

33:43.980 --> 33:48.683
<i>♪ and I'm not out for blood, you see ♪</i>

33:49.900 --> 33:53.550
I'm having trouble believing she's gone.

33:53.585 --> 33:55.757
Was there anyone here who
had a problem with her?

33:55.791 --> 33:57.726
- Anyone that she didn't like?
- God, no.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.694
I can't imagine anyone hurting her.

33:59.729 --> 34:02.731
She was like a kitten or a puppy.
She barely talked.

34:02.798 --> 34:05.000
- How was she doing in rehab?
- Okay, I guess.

34:05.034 --> 34:06.735
She said she liked music therapy

34:06.769 --> 34:08.570
as long as she didn't have
to play in front of people.

34:08.603 --> 34:10.572
Play piano or guitar?
Or both?

34:10.606 --> 34:13.975
- She only played piano.
- But she had a guitar.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.543
Yeah, but I never heard her play it.

34:15.610 --> 34:17.512
So you didn't know she was
performing in the subway?

34:17.545 --> 34:21.016
I-in public? Natasha?
No way.

34:21.083 --> 34:23.518
That's why she wanted to
leave the conservatory.

34:23.552 --> 34:25.420
I wonder how her
parents felt about that.

34:25.487 --> 34:27.879
She said they flipped.

34:29.891 --> 34:32.127
The conservatory's
all about performance.

34:32.161 --> 34:34.161
By senior year, that's all you do.

34:34.196 --> 34:36.898
Natasha couldn't perform
unless she was loaded.

34:36.931 --> 34:41.069
I'm guessing she was trying to decide
between sobriety and performing.

34:41.103 --> 34:42.837
According to Stanza's visitors log,

34:42.871 --> 34:45.139
the only people who ever
visited her were her parents.

34:45.206 --> 34:48.610
- So I'm just wondering who did this.
- Did what?

34:48.643 --> 34:50.578
<i>Some of the files on Natasha's
hard drive have been wiped out.</i>

34:50.612 --> 34:51.746
Actually, it's a lot of them.

34:51.813 --> 34:53.547
- Can you get it back?
- No.

34:53.616 --> 34:56.451
And it wasn't password-protected.
Anybody could have done it.

34:56.485 --> 34:57.886
I can't tell when, either.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.721
I went through Natasha's
medical records at Stanza.

34:59.755 --> 35:01.523
There's nothing to indicate

35:01.557 --> 35:03.191
she was taking any kind of
marshmallow-root supplement.

35:03.225 --> 35:05.727
Then how did that get in her stomach?

35:05.761 --> 35:07.562
You know, I'll check again

35:07.596 --> 35:09.964
to see if there are any other
uses for althea officinalis.

35:09.999 --> 35:12.701
Frost, you're sure the bar
didn't sell any food or drinks

35:12.735 --> 35:15.870
- that has marshmallow root in it?
- Yeah.

35:15.938 --> 35:18.773
<i>Maybe somebody gave her a supplement?</i>

35:18.841 --> 35:22.177
- Well, that's interesting.
- What? What did you find?

35:22.211 --> 35:26.181
- It's speculation.
- It's homicide. We speculate up here.

35:26.215 --> 35:29.684
Well, that's the flower
for althea officinalis.

35:29.719 --> 35:33.788
- That's the marshmallow-root flower.
- On the bottle of Mallow vodka.

35:33.856 --> 35:35.957
Which means there's
marshmallow root in it.

35:36.025 --> 35:37.759
It doesn't list the ingredients.

35:37.793 --> 35:40.628
<i>It doesn't have to.
Look at the shape of the indentation.</i>

35:40.663 --> 35:42.130
That's what Natasha had with her.

35:42.164 --> 35:44.299
Liquid courage. She was
gonna sing that night.

35:44.333 --> 35:46.301
But why would the
killer take the bottle?

35:46.335 --> 35:47.947
I've been looking at Natasha's homework.

35:48.016 --> 35:51.239
She was supposed to be
composing classical symphonies.

35:51.273 --> 35:53.108
<i>But she's writing something else here.</i>

35:58.047 --> 36:02.117
That's the song that Natasha
was singing in the subway.

36:02.184 --> 36:05.553
- What, you think she composed it?
- Maybe. But why hide it?

36:05.588 --> 36:07.555
Maybe because her
classical-musician father

36:07.590 --> 36:10.024
- didn't approve of indie rock.
- Huh.

36:10.059 --> 36:13.695
Natasha's roommate, Kelsey,
got a gift basket delivered at 7:00 P.M.

36:13.729 --> 36:16.064
<i>- Natasha signed for it.
- That's how the vodka got in.</i>

36:16.098 --> 36:17.966
<i>That rehab place
doesn't check deliveries.</i>

36:18.000 --> 36:20.535
Barbara said Natasha left
the rehab facility at 7:35,

36:20.569 --> 36:22.637
right after that gift
basket was delivered.

36:22.671 --> 36:24.572
The crinkle-cut paper
had chocolate on it.

36:24.607 --> 36:26.925
Yeah, and what would you put
in a gift basket that you were

36:26.926 --> 36:29.759
giving to someone who was
performing on camp fire night?

36:29.794 --> 36:33.982
- The ingredients for s'mores.
- Yeah, chocolates and marshmallow vodka.

36:34.016 --> 36:36.184
<i>That's what Natasha
had in her guitar case,</i>

36:36.218 --> 36:39.160
and that's why the
killer took the bottle.

36:49.122 --> 36:54.089
♪ No one else can make
all our wrongs right ♪

36:57.123 --> 36:59.316
♪ and then she said... ♪

36:59.578 --> 37:03.036
<i>♪ we must pay for our own blunders ♪</i>

37:03.071 --> 37:06.519
<i>♪ we must pay for our delights ♪</i>

37:06.554 --> 37:08.588
It sounds better when
Natasha sings it, doesn't it?

37:08.656 --> 37:12.559
I'm ... I'm rehearsing.
I've got a show.

37:12.593 --> 37:14.928
<i>Your shy roommate didn't know
how valuable her songs were,</i>

37:14.962 --> 37:17.646
<i>but you did, didn't you?
Natasha told you she was</i>

37:17.647 --> 37:20.200
gonna take that microphone
and sing her own song

37:20.234 --> 37:21.792
<i>in front of the record
company that signed you.</i>

37:21.869 --> 37:23.737
<i>Broad Sound records wanted
to hear their new star.</i>

37:23.771 --> 37:25.238
Because it's my song.

37:25.273 --> 37:26.740
That's why Broad Sound
records signed me.

37:26.808 --> 37:28.175
When did you write it?

37:28.242 --> 37:30.143
- About a month ago.
- How did you do that?

37:30.178 --> 37:34.948
- It was posted on youtube six months ago.
- You don't even play that, do you?

37:35.016 --> 37:37.384
That's just a prop.
You're no singer-songwriter.

37:37.418 --> 37:40.020
When you couldn't get your music
career going, you started to drink.

37:40.054 --> 37:42.089
<i>Rehab turned out to be
just the break you needed.</i>

37:42.156 --> 37:44.057
<i>Too bad about that damn gift basket.</i>

37:44.092 --> 37:45.993
There it was on the
card for Natasha to read.

37:46.027 --> 37:47.327
What did it say ...
"Congrats on your new hit.

37:47.362 --> 37:49.096
See you at the Argot"?

37:49.130 --> 37:51.231
Natasha stole my gift basket
so she could get drunk.

37:51.299 --> 37:52.799
She was already unstable.

37:52.834 --> 37:54.301
She showed up here
angry and out of control.

37:54.335 --> 37:55.402
She showed up to sing.

37:55.436 --> 37:58.271
And when Broad Sound
heard her voice and her story ...

37:58.306 --> 37:59.406
that you'd stolen her
music and her lyrics ...

37:59.440 --> 38:01.386
your new career was over.

38:02.310 --> 38:05.178
Nice black nail polish.
It's a new coat?

38:05.213 --> 38:07.381
<i>We need a sample to see
if it matches the stuff</i>

38:07.415 --> 38:09.216
<i>we found in Natasha's stab wounds.</i>

38:10.284 --> 38:14.060
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

38:14.355 --> 38:17.124
They all kept telling me, no,
they wanted singer-songwriters,

38:17.158 --> 38:18.325
so I took some of her songs.

38:18.359 --> 38:20.961
<i>I recorded them, and I put them up.</i>

38:20.995 --> 38:24.398
They went viral, and then
it spun out of control.

38:25.366 --> 38:29.296
You're under arrest for the
murder of Natasha Osmanski.

38:43.317 --> 38:45.518
What are you doing here?

38:45.586 --> 38:49.289
He came here to tell
you something... himself.

38:49.323 --> 38:52.525
I came here to apologize...
to you, Jane.

38:52.560 --> 38:55.228
And you, Maura.

38:55.296 --> 38:56.496
I was a pig last night.

38:58.132 --> 39:02.469
- Don't blame it on the wine, Pop.
- I said some terrible things.

39:02.503 --> 39:04.704
I screwed up. I'm sorry.

39:04.772 --> 39:08.174
Well, thank you for apologizing.

39:08.242 --> 39:09.709
That must be hard for you.

39:10.744 --> 39:14.848
It is.
It always has been.

39:14.882 --> 39:16.683
<i>But I got some good news.</i>

39:16.717 --> 39:19.686
I do have cancer, but they
said it was... stage 2.

39:19.720 --> 39:21.821
That's very treatable.

39:23.190 --> 39:24.391
I'm glad to hear that.

39:24.425 --> 39:28.361
I want you to forgive me, Jane.
Please.

39:28.396 --> 39:31.097
You're my number-one daughter.

39:31.732 --> 39:34.301
I'm your only daughter, Pop.

39:37.238 --> 39:39.873
Okay, so, now what?

39:39.907 --> 39:42.342
I'm thinking about
moving back to Boston.

39:42.376 --> 39:47.480
You have a new life in Florida, Frank.
I have a new life here.

39:47.548 --> 39:51.284
- What are you saying, Ang?
- I'm saying...

39:51.319 --> 39:54.504
you're not my husband anymore.

39:55.456 --> 39:59.192
You'll always be our children's father.

39:59.260 --> 40:02.228
<i>And I'll be here if you need me.</i>

40:02.263 --> 40:04.597
But you should go back.

40:06.300 --> 40:11.237
- Jane?
- No, stay in touch, Pop.

40:11.305 --> 40:14.292
<i>It's a short flight.
Come back anytime.</i>

40:14.508 --> 40:15.742
Okay.

40:17.578 --> 40:21.414
- You take care of yourself, Angela.
- You too, Frank.

40:26.754 --> 40:28.888
<i>Goodbye, my sweet big girl.</i>

40:30.524 --> 40:34.160
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too.

40:34.195 --> 40:35.628
<i>All right.</i>

40:48.308 --> 40:49.909
<i>Okay.</i>

40:51.412 --> 40:53.413
<i>So...</i>

40:53.447 --> 40:57.183
now that we're all good and
depressed, what should we do?

40:58.452 --> 41:00.453
I have some jello from last night.

41:00.488 --> 41:03.390
- Nobody ate it.
- Well, that's a shock.

41:04.925 --> 41:08.428
- I have some cookies.
- The ones that taste like cardboard?

41:08.496 --> 41:11.364
The night just gets better and better!

41:11.432 --> 41:13.867
<i>Oh, good, well, I'm glad
I saved some for you.</i>

41:13.901 --> 41:16.403
I'm really proud of the way
you handled yourself, Ma.

41:16.437 --> 41:17.737
I'm proud of you, Jane...

41:17.772 --> 41:19.706
and your brothers ...

41:19.740 --> 41:22.666
that's who I'm proud of.

41:24.945 --> 41:27.881
And thanks for putting up
with us nut balls, Maura.

41:27.915 --> 41:30.817
What do you mean,
putting up with you?

41:30.851 --> 41:33.753
You're my nut balls!
You're my family.
