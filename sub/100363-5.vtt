00:06.960 --> 00:09.119
Previously on "The Magicians"...

00:09.120 --> 00:10.459
There's too much magic.

00:10.460 --> 00:12.459
Everything that I touch just...

00:12.460 --> 00:14.055
it grows like crazy.

00:14.056 --> 00:15.839
I'm gonna let your bullshit slide

00:15.840 --> 00:17.839
on account of you so
recently being possessed

00:17.840 --> 00:19.879
by a homicidal monster.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.339
There was a blood worm scare,

00:21.340 --> 00:23.147
so the Library gave a lot
of hedges the Reed's Mark.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.775
I found a spell to remove
the Marks in a Depository.

00:25.776 --> 00:28.319
I get you're on a mission.
One of you's got to jet.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.446
Either one of you can hang for eternity.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.989
I've earned the right to step off.

00:32.990 --> 00:34.909
We're here to study with Mayakovsky.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.786
I hate all of you.

00:36.787 --> 00:37.830
Professor?

00:38.690 --> 00:39.770
_

00:40.249 --> 00:41.999
"Best bitches."

00:42.000 --> 00:44.044
Wear this, and you'll see what I see.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.529
I'm Clarion, the goddess of melody.

00:46.530 --> 00:49.199
The way that you're imagining
the Harmonic Convergence

00:49.200 --> 00:50.439
isn't quite enough.

00:50.440 --> 00:53.511
When all the spells cast by
all the Magicians go haywire,

00:53.512 --> 00:56.556
you're gonna get earthquakes,
starvation, plague.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.600
She didn't have time to be delicate.

00:58.601 --> 01:00.476
You can't travel anymore.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.604
What exactly are we looking for, sir?

01:02.605 --> 01:05.059
Not what. Who.

01:05.060 --> 01:07.499
- You two know each other?
- No.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.279
Well, your subjects
are rightly grateful.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.329
For sending that letter?

01:10.330 --> 01:12.655
AKA that thing I totally
didn't do; you did.

01:12.656 --> 01:15.032
I was gonna let you die for Fillory.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.784
The Convergence can be stopped.

01:16.785 --> 01:20.809
All you have to do is move...

01:20.810 --> 01:22.041
that.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.479
The Harmonic Convergence.

01:26.480 --> 01:30.319
- AKA the end of the world.
- Not necessarily.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.779
This constellation forms a cosmic sigil

01:32.780 --> 01:34.880
that increases magical intensity.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.472
It has happened in the past
without causing an apocalypse.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.223
But now there's surges of magic.

01:39.224 --> 01:42.477
So we get the disaster movie
Clarion was talking about.

01:42.478 --> 01:45.813
The Convergence will only occur
during this perfect alignment.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.559
If we move the moon out of position...

01:48.560 --> 01:50.519
No Convergence, no Circumstance,

01:50.520 --> 01:51.620
no apocalypse.

01:51.630 --> 01:55.579
The moon is not just a rock in space.
It has certain properties.

01:55.580 --> 01:57.492
- Like?
- Magic doesn't work on it.

01:57.493 --> 01:59.949
Thanks to Magicians
casting haphazardly on it

01:59.950 --> 02:02.349
for millennia, the moon is
now covered by a crust

02:02.350 --> 02:04.519
of spell debris, blocking new spells.

02:04.520 --> 02:07.544
If we move any piece out
of place, no Convergence.

02:07.545 --> 02:09.940
Well, what if we just moved Mars?

02:09.949 --> 02:12.423
She said with a straight face.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.801
The other pieces are planets.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.829
We can't move them
because they are, well,

02:16.830 --> 02:18.640
very big and far away.

02:18.650 --> 02:20.279
The moon is the only celestial body

02:20.280 --> 02:21.599
we stand a chance of affecting.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.849
But won't that screw
with the Circumstances?

02:23.850 --> 02:25.353
What will magic be like when we're done?

02:25.354 --> 02:26.809
Impossible to know.

02:26.810 --> 02:29.358
It will be a brand-new Circumstance.

02:30.010 --> 02:33.279
But to get to that problem,
we need to solve this one.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.979
Good, well, I hope you have some ideas,

02:34.980 --> 02:36.198
because we're striking out.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.701
I do. Consult the Lunatics.

02:40.030 --> 02:42.412
- The lunatics?
- Short for "Lunar Fanatics."

02:42.413 --> 02:45.299
In the Middle Ages,
people thought insanity

02:45.300 --> 02:47.339
was caused by changing
phases of the moon.

02:47.340 --> 02:50.378
In fact, it was often a Lunatic
in the throes of worship.

02:50.379 --> 02:53.499
They claimed to be able to
achieve a magical connection

02:53.500 --> 02:56.139
with the moon and even under
some circumstances...

02:56.140 --> 02:57.169
move it.

02:57.170 --> 02:58.679
Well, that sounds useful.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.579
- Mm.
- Well, if it's just branding,

03:01.580 --> 03:03.267
it means they're not
really crazy, right?

03:03.270 --> 03:06.359
My dad always said that
they were batshit insane,

03:06.360 --> 03:08.799
and he married my mom,
so he had a pretty high bar

03:08.800 --> 03:09.919
for mental instability.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.379
Regardless, they know more
about the moon than anyone.

03:13.380 --> 03:16.859
I believe that talking to them
is our only chance at success.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.679
_

03:35.680 --> 03:36.966
What people don't understand

03:36.967 --> 03:38.819
is there is a skeleton of the universe,

03:38.820 --> 03:40.079
but we are the bones.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.399
Oh, that's good to know.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.679
I am a humerus.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.139
You? Patella.

03:46.140 --> 03:48.679
We wanted to ask you about the moon.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.279
Can we talk about it?

03:50.280 --> 03:53.279
It... it?

03:53.280 --> 03:55.027
Her Lunacy...

03:56.320 --> 04:00.099
Identifies as she/her.

04:00.100 --> 04:02.739
That's right. We knew that, right?

04:02.740 --> 04:04.769
- Of course.
- We know.

04:04.770 --> 04:07.663
If we wanted to move Her,
how could we do that?

04:07.664 --> 04:10.149
You don't move Her.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.649
Okay, listen, Reba.

04:12.650 --> 04:15.585
In just a few days, a whole lot
of people are going to die.

04:15.586 --> 04:16.798
That's a whole lot people

04:16.800 --> 04:18.382
that will never get to worship the moon.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.959
They will never get to
know Her like you do.

04:20.959 --> 04:24.689
If She can help us save
all of those lives...

04:24.690 --> 04:27.259
imagine everyone that will realize

04:27.260 --> 04:29.629
just how much She deserves their love,

04:29.630 --> 04:30.978
their reverence.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.689
So will you help us?

04:34.770 --> 04:36.790
Just to be clear.

04:37.870 --> 04:40.279
You don't move Her.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.615
You ask Her to move.

04:42.616 --> 04:46.035
And She won't let you speak to
Her unless you get moon brain.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.912
So one of us needs moon brain.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.949
Not one of you. Three of you.

04:50.950 --> 04:53.699
A single Magician cannot
generate enough power

04:53.700 --> 04:54.870
to reach Her.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.629
So it's a cooperative spell then.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.756
It is a sign of respect, Kneecap,

04:58.757 --> 05:01.384
that allows you to see
Her as She truly is.

05:01.385 --> 05:04.229
If you have moon brain,
then you will see Her aura.

05:04.230 --> 05:06.419
Now it is red, but when you
perform the Dianic Ritual,

05:06.420 --> 05:07.430
Her aura will change.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.329
If it is yellow, She is considering.

05:09.330 --> 05:11.679
If it is green, She is listening.

05:11.680 --> 05:15.709
Only then may you ask Her

05:15.710 --> 05:16.949
to move.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.239
Red, yellow, green.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.519
The guy who invented the stoplight,

05:20.520 --> 05:22.400
was he a Lunatic too?

05:22.406 --> 05:24.899
William Potts? Yeah.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.679
Oh, cool.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.119
All three Magicians
must perform the ritual

05:29.120 --> 05:31.589
until the moon is listening.

05:31.590 --> 05:35.159
A warning: once Her aura is green,
She may choose to listen

05:35.160 --> 05:37.503
to anyone who calls to Her, so be ready.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.004
You must choose one,
the strongest among you,

05:40.005 --> 05:42.843
to speak to Her, like the
old Lunatics taught us to.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.679
For this second part,
however, there is a price.

05:45.680 --> 05:49.680
- A price, like blood?
- It is like blood to Her.

05:49.690 --> 05:52.810
You will need a piece
of Her. A sacrifice.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.779
A piece?

05:54.780 --> 05:56.981
- Or like a moon rock?
- Yes.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.259
But be aware,

05:59.260 --> 06:01.289
this will destroy it,

06:01.290 --> 06:03.989
so don't use your favorite one.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.617
This is the price of
speaking to the moon.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.744
Just a few more questions.

06:09.745 --> 06:12.999
What is moon brain,
and how do we get it?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.083
- Everyone line up.
- Pudding time!

06:16.084 --> 06:18.127
Lovely to speak to you.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.046
You too, Kneecap.

06:25.050 --> 06:28.540
You ever just spin a globe,
stick your finger down,

06:28.550 --> 06:30.719
see where it lands?

06:30.720 --> 06:32.059
It's almost always water,

06:32.060 --> 06:33.379
because, well, duh.

06:33.380 --> 06:36.789
Earth is mostly water, but
sometimes it's the Sahara,

06:36.790 --> 06:39.649
sometimes the Urals.

06:39.650 --> 06:42.652
That's what you'd be doing
if you tried to travel.

06:42.653 --> 06:45.863
Only instead of the
globe, the multiverse,

06:45.864 --> 06:48.739
which is bigger and deadlier.

06:48.740 --> 06:50.239
Afraid you'd say that.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.879
I looked at everything I could think of,

06:51.880 --> 06:53.599
magical and medical.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.582
Nada. You're grounded.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.579
All right, well, since
I ain't traveling,

06:58.580 --> 06:59.749
I should probably step down.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.299
Uh, if you're offering your resignation,

07:01.300 --> 07:02.309
I don't accept.

07:02.310 --> 07:04.089
Not offering. Stating.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.217
With Dean Fogg out indefinitely,

07:06.218 --> 07:09.137
Brakebills has instituted our
Dean Vanishment Protocol.

07:10.140 --> 07:11.989
Of course, that's a thing here.

07:11.990 --> 07:14.329
Yeah, and uh...

07:14.330 --> 07:15.851
That makes me acting Dean Lipson.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.269
There's no instruction manual,

07:17.270 --> 07:18.969
so I'm kinda dean-ing on the fly here,

07:18.970 --> 07:20.099
but one thing I do know

07:20.100 --> 07:22.499
is losing a professor who was disabled

07:22.500 --> 07:24.020
on school grounds ain't happening.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.579
I mean, the optics would
be pure shitflakes.

07:26.580 --> 07:30.450
So your contract will be
honored and enforced.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.740
Oh, also.

07:35.380 --> 07:36.915
We need a new Welters coach.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.789
I've been on the inside,
and I'm telling you

07:42.790 --> 07:44.335
it's a goddamn goose-stepping,

07:44.336 --> 07:47.091
fairy-snatching, ethnic
cleansing Gestapo.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.299
To be fair, the ethnic
cleansing happened

07:49.300 --> 07:51.220
after the Dark King left, so...

07:51.221 --> 07:53.181
He's innocent because he delegates?

07:53.182 --> 07:54.719
No, that's not what I'm saying.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.099
Someone in this castle ordered
the hunt on that Fairy.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.439
It could have been the Dark King,

07:58.440 --> 07:59.839
but if it was someone else,

07:59.840 --> 08:01.647
killing Seb might just
make things worse.

08:01.648 --> 08:06.862
So we have to find out
who before we... coup.

08:08.350 --> 08:10.990
I just wanna stab someone.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.289
I haven't heard you
this bloodthirsty in...

08:13.290 --> 08:15.786
well, not that long,
but still, it's notable.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.329
Maybe I'm a bit on edge.

08:18.330 --> 08:20.207
Josh keeps wanting to talk.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.399
You mean about how you wanted

08:21.400 --> 08:22.499
to leave him in the past to die?

08:22.500 --> 08:23.920
Yeah, that.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.139
So far, I'm doing a good
job of avoiding him,

08:27.140 --> 08:28.799
but eventually he's gonna sneak...

08:28.800 --> 08:30.009
Guys.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.578
- Hey, what's up?
- 'Sup?

08:32.580 --> 08:34.009
First off, kudos on the hiding spot.

08:34.010 --> 08:35.222
It took me forever to find you.

08:35.224 --> 08:36.640
Pretty busy here, Josh.

08:36.640 --> 08:37.649
You're busy?

08:37.650 --> 08:38.851
I just got promoted to head chef.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.049
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

08:41.049 --> 08:42.979
But I'm about to bail on a state dinner

08:42.980 --> 08:45.519
and leave it to my incompetent
sous-chef because...

08:45.520 --> 08:47.389
Apocalypse! Now!

08:47.390 --> 08:49.299
Josh, would you just give it up?

08:49.300 --> 08:50.988
He keeps trying to get us
to join his film club,

08:50.989 --> 08:52.698
which I told him would
never work on a planet

08:52.699 --> 08:54.742
with no electricity or taste.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.995
Uh, no, uh, sorry.
This one's just a little shy.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.439
It... it's okay, buddy.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.959
- Help us stop the...
- Apocalypse! Now!

09:03.870 --> 09:06.260
- Oh.
- We need to get back to Earth.

09:06.270 --> 09:07.839
Margo, our talk will have to wait

09:07.840 --> 09:09.509
till after we save the world.

09:09.510 --> 09:11.719
Oh, but then I have my
nephew's bar mitzvah.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.345
So after that?

09:14.550 --> 09:16.180
- Mazel.
- Thanks.

09:18.290 --> 09:21.449
What about our thing? We have
a lot of fact-finding to do

09:21.450 --> 09:23.104
before I can get to stabbing.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.559
No problem.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.273
I know just who to handle it.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.025
You want me to what?

09:28.026 --> 09:31.329
Just find out who in the
castle hates Fairies.

09:31.330 --> 09:33.569
Okay? And what they're doing to them.

09:33.570 --> 09:35.282
And why Fairies in the first place?

09:35.283 --> 09:38.199
And maybe talk to some Fairies,
get their side of things.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.479
- Okay.
- And while you're at it...

09:40.480 --> 09:42.207
anything else that seems important.

09:42.208 --> 09:44.119
Okay, okay, okay.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.590
No, um... That seems like a
lot of open-ended questions.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.599
- Mm-hmm.
- I got this maid job

09:48.600 --> 09:49.699
to be close to you guys,

09:49.700 --> 09:52.239
and now you're deserting me?

09:52.240 --> 09:54.636
I want to stop an apocalypse too.

09:55.780 --> 09:57.819
Every apocalypse-stopping mission

09:57.820 --> 09:59.849
needs a maid on the outside.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.859
It's a key staple in Earth movies.

10:01.860 --> 10:03.019
Do you mean inside man?

10:03.020 --> 10:04.728
'Cause that's more of
a heist movie thing.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.069
- No, that's different.
- Okay.

10:07.070 --> 10:08.199
Everyone knows

10:08.200 --> 10:11.139
the "secret, sexy maid
on the outside" trope.

10:11.140 --> 10:13.179
- Yeah?
- Josh has a film club.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.409
- You should check it out.
- Huh.

10:15.410 --> 10:18.900
Maid on the outside. Yeah.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.660
So did your loony friend
say how to get moon brain?

10:23.665 --> 10:25.549
From what we read, her rituals

10:25.550 --> 10:28.059
are simple first-year Popper tuts.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.589
But moon brain is...

10:29.590 --> 10:33.174
the insanity you get from
extreme sleep deprivation.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.759
Extreme, like a night partying,
or what are we talking about?

10:35.760 --> 10:37.269
I wish.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.846
Five nights without sleep,

10:38.847 --> 10:41.069
and we can't use magic
to stay awake either.

10:41.070 --> 10:43.434
Apparently, moon brain has
to come about naturally.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.469
This is completely nuts.

10:45.470 --> 10:48.279
Isn't the Harmonic whatever
happening in five nights?

10:48.280 --> 10:50.449
Yes, so if we all start tonight,

10:50.450 --> 10:52.359
we might actually have
a shot at stopping it.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.469
Wait a minute.

10:53.470 --> 10:56.280
Five nights without sleep is
gonna fuck us up royally.

10:56.281 --> 10:59.283
Can we even cast if
we're that messed up?

10:59.284 --> 11:00.826
Well, three of us have to.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.659
Look, guys, I know it sucks,

11:02.660 --> 11:07.359
but whoever can stay up for 132 hours

11:07.360 --> 11:10.377
without sleep and not lose their shit...

11:10.378 --> 11:11.546
gets to stop the apocalypse.

11:17.260 --> 11:21.209
I don't know about you guys,
but I am doing great.

11:21.210 --> 11:22.940
- _
- Coffee.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.459
Where's our fearless leader?

11:24.460 --> 11:26.059
- _
- She's taking a cold shower

11:26.060 --> 11:27.089
to keep herself awake.

11:27.090 --> 11:29.369
Third... fourth time this morning.

11:29.370 --> 11:31.440
Well, I don't know about you guys,

11:31.441 --> 11:33.609
but I am too excited to sleep.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.260
I mean, we're doing it!

11:35.270 --> 11:37.905
Is this, uh, helping
you find moon rocks?

11:37.906 --> 11:39.379
Mm.

11:39.380 --> 11:42.319
No, this is helping us stay awake.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.839
The moment I research,
I'm out like a light.

11:44.840 --> 11:45.870
Know what might help?

11:45.872 --> 11:48.207
If we make this party a
little more '80s themed.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.619
Eliot.

11:50.620 --> 11:52.249
Oh, I don't think we should.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.255
If we ski the fresh
powder, know what I mean?

11:54.256 --> 11:57.383
- Yeah, I get it.
- I mean cocaine.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.759
Get me cocaine.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.919
- I am not getting you cocaine.
- Eliot.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.719
A five-day bender would
destroy your nose,

12:02.720 --> 12:04.599
and could you imagine what that would do

12:04.600 --> 12:05.609
to your sense of taste?

12:05.610 --> 12:06.979
I get a full nine every night,

12:06.980 --> 12:09.079
and I'm still a bitch.
This is gonna get real.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.019
Hey, guys, come check this out.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.193
I found something.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.379
NASA brought back a bunch of moon rocks

12:18.380 --> 12:19.560
from the Apollo missions.

12:19.570 --> 12:21.459
We're stealing from NASA? Hell, yeah.

12:21.460 --> 12:23.629
Mama's checking one more
off her bucket list.

12:23.630 --> 12:25.279
Okay, we're not stealing from NASA.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.499
I checked, it's impossible. I'm sorry.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.169
But some of the rocks
that they brought back,

12:29.170 --> 12:31.292
they gave out as gifts,
and they went missing.

12:31.293 --> 12:33.739
About 180.

12:33.740 --> 12:34.819
The ones they did find,

12:34.820 --> 12:36.409
they found 'em in garages,

12:36.410 --> 12:39.109
desk drawers, kids' bedrooms.
Just lying around.

12:39.110 --> 12:41.427
People forgot about them,
but they're out there,

12:41.428 --> 12:43.012
and I definitely think we can get one.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.379
Okay, you guys do that.

12:44.380 --> 12:46.169
I'm gonna go get some
stay-awake supplies.

12:46.170 --> 12:48.934
I have a muffin recipe
with a special ingredient

12:48.935 --> 12:51.186
that is guaranteed to keep
us alert for five days.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.938
What is it? Meth?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.429
Oh, excuse you.

12:54.430 --> 12:56.984
It is a organic, locally-sourced

12:56.985 --> 13:00.639
natural stimulant that got me
through every finals week,

13:00.640 --> 13:01.860
and it is definitely not meth.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.299
That's exactly what I would say

13:03.300 --> 13:04.860
if I was trying to get us to take meth.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.369
Mm-hmm.

13:15.820 --> 13:17.790
You're taking retirement well.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.019
I find that organization

13:20.020 --> 13:23.389
helps bring a sense of stability
when one's feeling...

13:23.390 --> 13:24.511
not stable.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.710
Okay.

13:27.230 --> 13:29.999
I need to find a Book
Depository that got moved.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.352
It's in Hell's Kitchen,
that's all I know.

13:31.353 --> 13:33.429
Library buildings are
enchanted to blend in

13:33.430 --> 13:35.669
with their new environs
whenever they're relocated.

13:35.670 --> 13:37.249
You'll have to go door-to-door,

13:37.250 --> 13:39.109
find the building covered
in Library wards.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.649
Great. Let's go.

13:40.650 --> 13:43.239
You're abandoning your friends?

13:43.240 --> 13:46.060
They have enough people
for a rock search.

13:46.070 --> 13:48.339
Plus, whatever's in Josh's
muffins doesn't sound like

13:48.340 --> 13:50.910
something a person in
recovery should be taking.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.549
I need to find the Depository

13:52.550 --> 13:54.875
before we move the moon
and screw up magic.

13:54.876 --> 13:58.089
Right now, we have enough
to remove Reed's Marks.

13:58.090 --> 14:00.757
After, like you said, who knows?

14:02.060 --> 14:04.129
I'm not sure I'd be much use to you.

14:04.130 --> 14:05.594
Out in the world.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.389
The building's impenetrable
on a good day.

14:08.390 --> 14:11.760
Unless you're a Librarian who
knows the security protocols.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.219
I don't know...

14:14.220 --> 14:17.099
I'm not asking for your help.

14:17.100 --> 14:21.560
I'm giving you a chance to fix
your massive, massive mistake.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.649
Mm.

14:23.650 --> 14:25.479
Let's go.

14:41.670 --> 14:43.258
High King Fen?

14:44.080 --> 14:45.420
Fairy!

14:45.427 --> 14:48.539
Keep the High King talk quiet.

14:48.540 --> 14:49.888
I'm undercover.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.763
- You will come with me.
- Oh!

14:51.764 --> 14:53.160
That... that is so great.

14:53.170 --> 14:55.309
I have a lot of questions for you.

14:55.310 --> 14:57.563
Some I don't even know why I'm asking.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.356
They said you would fear me.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.089
Funny thing.

15:01.090 --> 15:03.179
I am on a Fairy quest.

15:03.180 --> 15:07.079
See, I'm a maid on the outside.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.160
Super-secret. Super-sexy.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.788
Follow me, Maid on the Outside Fen.

15:14.670 --> 15:15.869
Good.

15:15.870 --> 15:17.083
Okay.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.341
- Guess what I found.
- You found a moon rock?

15:26.342 --> 15:28.169
I found a moon rock.

15:28.170 --> 15:30.119
And those muffins smell amazing.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.390
- Thank you.
- Now all we have to do is stay awake.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.267
You know what helps me stay awake?

15:35.268 --> 15:38.719
- What's that?
- An open, naked conversation

15:38.720 --> 15:40.273
about our relationship.

15:41.660 --> 15:44.819
I wanna tell you about all
my repressed emotions.

15:47.230 --> 15:49.569
One by one.

15:49.570 --> 15:51.408
Oh, baby.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.430
Josh.

15:53.450 --> 15:56.140
Josh.

15:56.150 --> 15:57.207
Josh!

15:58.290 --> 15:59.375
Josh!

16:00.140 --> 16:02.586
- Oh, no.
- Josh!

16:03.713 --> 16:05.549
Oh, shit.

16:05.550 --> 16:07.570
Oh, shit!

16:10.420 --> 16:12.119
We leave you for one afternoon,

16:12.120 --> 16:13.680
and you fuck us completely.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.579
I'm sorry, guys.

16:15.580 --> 16:19.144
I sat down for one minute
because I never fall asleep

16:19.145 --> 16:20.437
when I have something in the oven.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.481
Well, congratulations.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.608
This is a milestone for you.

16:24.609 --> 16:25.799
Hey, guys.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.444
Hope you had better luck than we did.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.489
Nope, we portal-hopped
every lead we had.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.059
The closest thing we found
was a chunk of old concrete

16:33.060 --> 16:35.240
with the word "moon"
written on it in Sharpie.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.495
Those rocks are gone.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.719
But we did come home

16:37.720 --> 16:39.665
to find Josh sleeping peacefully.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.889
I'm going to assume your rudeness

16:41.890 --> 16:44.212
is because sleep deprivation
makes you irritable.

16:44.213 --> 16:46.079
Sure. Assume that.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.631
Yeah, I get it.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.929
I'm gonna have to staple
my eyes open; this is rough.

16:49.930 --> 16:52.929
No one else sleeps. We have four nights.

16:52.930 --> 16:55.379
We need one rock lead to pan out.

16:55.380 --> 16:56.929
But if the spell burns them up,

16:56.930 --> 16:58.819
what if we can't find any rocks

16:58.820 --> 17:00.602
because the Lunatics used them all?

17:00.603 --> 17:02.855
What if there's no more
moon rocks on Earth?

17:03.800 --> 17:04.939
Just sayin',

17:04.940 --> 17:08.039
we could celebrate the Harmonic
Convergence in Fillory.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.319
It's a little dystopian at the mo',

17:10.329 --> 17:12.199
but on the plus, their weekend forecast

17:12.200 --> 17:13.825
doesn't call for an apocalypse.

17:16.990 --> 17:19.358
Look, guys,

17:19.359 --> 17:22.199
if you're looking for some
sort of inspirational speech

17:22.200 --> 17:25.199
on why you should stay and fight,

17:25.200 --> 17:28.460
I can't help you. It's gonna suck,

17:28.470 --> 17:32.239
and even if we do succeed,
which we might not,

17:32.240 --> 17:35.219
it's not like we're
gonna get any credit.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.959
The world ends, I end with it,

17:36.960 --> 17:40.929
knowing that I did everything I could,

17:40.930 --> 17:44.146
because I won't be able to
live with myself otherwise.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.849
Julia's right.

17:45.850 --> 17:48.919
She really does suck at
inspirational speeches.

17:48.920 --> 17:53.849
But also that we should save the world.

17:53.850 --> 17:54.899
I'm with you.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.450
So am I.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.989
Me too.

17:57.990 --> 17:59.328
I'm in.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.788
And my axe!

18:04.208 --> 18:05.417
Really?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.627
- No?
- No.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.819
Should've led with, "You have my bow."

18:08.820 --> 18:09.835
- Mm-hmm.
- Nope.

18:09.836 --> 18:12.967
Josh, put some fresh meth
muffins in the oven.

18:12.968 --> 18:14.089
Again, not meth.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.307
_

18:22.890 --> 18:25.437
Hey! No droopy eyes on my watch.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.439
_

18:26.440 --> 18:27.740
One more.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.659
- _
- I'm good now.

18:30.660 --> 18:31.669
I ain't.

18:31.670 --> 18:35.060
Oh, well, right on cue.

18:35.070 --> 18:38.659
I tried something new this round.

18:38.660 --> 18:42.746
A hint of lavender and goji berry.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.831
How we doin', Captain?

18:44.832 --> 18:46.639
Oh, you know, 12 hours
till the end of the world,

18:46.640 --> 18:48.239
and it's like we're still

18:48.240 --> 18:49.878
grasping for needles in a hay straw.

18:49.879 --> 18:52.419
Fun. Okay.

18:52.420 --> 18:54.800
Probably not the best
question for morale,

18:54.801 --> 18:57.519
but as the only person here
who's slept this week,

18:57.520 --> 19:00.419
we have 12 hours and zero leads.

19:00.420 --> 19:03.039
Is waiting here to die
really the best option?

19:03.040 --> 19:05.410
When are we gonna give
Margo's idea another think?

19:08.330 --> 19:09.941
Guys, I can't trust my brain right now,

19:09.942 --> 19:11.939
but this seems like
it could be relevant.

19:11.940 --> 19:13.736
I think this guy has a moon rock.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.669
Oren Westbrook. Why do I know him?

19:16.670 --> 19:17.989
Because you're not a cave person.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.679
He invented the tech for pop-up ads,

19:20.680 --> 19:23.161
and he invented the tech
to block pop-up ads.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.199
Ever since, he's just
been a weird rich guy

19:25.200 --> 19:27.199
doing weird-rich-guy shit.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.710
I heard his blood boy
has his own blood boy.

19:31.690 --> 19:34.179
Ew, what's on his eye?

19:34.180 --> 19:36.170
That's the same tattoo that Reba had.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.339
Julia, I think he's a Lunatic.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.379
All right.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.974
So in order to save the
world, all we have to do

19:43.975 --> 19:48.369
is convince some eccentric
billionaire with armed guards

19:48.370 --> 19:51.579
to give up something he
probably considers to be, like,

19:51.580 --> 19:52.599
his Holy Grail.

19:52.600 --> 19:56.486
All while we're so tired
we can't see straight.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.979
Pshh, no sweat.

20:05.700 --> 20:06.788
Marvelous.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.083
How did you handle the pain?

20:09.940 --> 20:12.159
Knowing it would bring
me closer to Her Lunacy

20:12.160 --> 20:14.290
- helped me get through it.
- _

20:14.297 --> 20:15.679
_

20:15.680 --> 20:17.979
Same as when I got mine.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.801
That and a handful of opiates.

20:25.890 --> 20:26.999
Hey, sorry about the security.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.079
I hope you guys understand.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.629
Ah, please, you can't
let in every Lunatic.

20:30.630 --> 20:31.855
Some people are crazy.

20:34.140 --> 20:35.690
Eliot.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.559
Oh, wow, you guys really look awful.

20:40.560 --> 20:41.569
What?

20:41.570 --> 20:42.579
Eliot...

20:42.580 --> 20:44.059
Your sunken eyes!

20:44.060 --> 20:46.828
- Let me out.
- Preparing for moon brain?

20:46.829 --> 20:49.119
The Harmonic Convergence.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.957
Mm! Yeah, baby.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.542
I'm celebrating too.

20:52.543 --> 20:55.213
I'm gonna have a few
friends over for a party.

20:57.460 --> 20:59.259
Uh, El?

20:59.260 --> 21:00.467
Eliot?

21:00.468 --> 21:02.829
Eliot, you good?

21:02.830 --> 21:05.119
- Yeah, yea... yeah.
- Yeah.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.229
Just can't wait to see
this amazing moon rock.

21:07.230 --> 21:08.767
Don't worry.

21:08.768 --> 21:12.230
You both will experience Her.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.179
What a cozy little nightmare.

21:28.180 --> 21:29.859
I might need you to
punch me to stay awake.

21:29.860 --> 21:30.872
Gotcha.

21:30.873 --> 21:33.289
- Isn't She wondrous?
- Yeah, definitely.

21:33.290 --> 21:34.334
Think we can turn on the lights

21:34.335 --> 21:36.229
and turn off the yoga music?

21:36.230 --> 21:39.669
You got this from the moon... how?

21:39.670 --> 21:40.819
I went.

21:40.820 --> 21:43.969
You just went to the moon
like it was Coney Island?

21:43.970 --> 21:45.859
Yeah, actually, it was pretty tough.

21:45.860 --> 21:48.979
To be honest, I was trying
to impress someone.

21:48.980 --> 21:52.019
But in the end, our
souls did not connect.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.896
Yeah, we need to ask a favor.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.814
For my fellow Lunatics,
I would move Heaven and Earth.

21:57.815 --> 21:59.380
About that...

21:59.390 --> 22:01.361
Yeah, look, we know this
rock is special to you...

22:01.362 --> 22:03.864
- Super special.
- But we need it.

22:03.865 --> 22:06.366
To move Her. Hence the moon brain.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.034
You do know what that would do, right?

22:08.035 --> 22:09.759
Yes, but it's a matter
of life and death.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.239
We can stop the Harmonic Convergence

22:11.240 --> 22:13.490
if we can hold the moon out
of position long enough.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.829
- Why?
- Because it's going to cause

22:15.830 --> 22:17.168
worldwide destruction.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.890
Magic will become so powerful,
it'll be apocalyptic.

22:19.900 --> 22:23.460
I mean, it's not like it's gonna
wipe out all life on Earth.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.699
Just some.

22:24.700 --> 22:26.970
You know exactly how
bad it's going to get,

22:26.971 --> 22:28.160
don't you?

22:28.170 --> 22:30.015
What, are you planning to
profit off this or something?

22:30.016 --> 22:31.879
I'm planning to use my resources

22:31.880 --> 22:33.143
to help the world recover.

22:33.144 --> 22:34.919
Now, I'm an entrepreneurial spirit.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.719
I can't help but make money.

22:36.720 --> 22:39.980
Now, I do think that the moon
brain is getting to you.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.550
Unless...

22:43.740 --> 22:47.570
Mm, your eye tattoo is illusion magic.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.492
You're no Lunatic at all.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.799
I'll have my guards escort you out.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.609
Let's go, El. We tried.

22:54.610 --> 22:56.820
Happens all the time.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.802
- Get it?
- All of it.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.053
We have a problem.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.399
So it's just security cameras

23:10.400 --> 23:11.765
until we get to the moon rock room,

23:11.766 --> 23:13.434
and that's where it gets tough.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.620
One way in, one way out.

23:15.630 --> 23:18.022
I mean, if we get caught, we're trapped.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.442
Guys. Guys!

23:22.860 --> 23:24.946
Thanks!

23:27.840 --> 23:30.409
So... the rock.

23:30.410 --> 23:33.036
Whole lotta wards around it,
nothing we can't get past,

23:33.037 --> 23:35.309
except for the one on the rock itself.

23:35.310 --> 23:38.699
It's... well, it's a bond that
we've never seen before,

23:38.700 --> 23:40.160
put there by Mayakovsky.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.389
Well, that can't be right.

23:42.390 --> 23:43.964
Oren just got the rock.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.715
And didn't you say the last time

23:45.716 --> 23:48.176
you saw Mayakovsky,
he was basically senile?

23:48.177 --> 23:49.929
Yeah, well, I guess he got better.

23:49.930 --> 23:52.059
I mean, he... he put his signature

23:52.060 --> 23:53.499
into the lattice work of the spell.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.699
You can't miss it.
It's the most amazing,

23:55.700 --> 23:57.770
most narcissistic thing I've ever seen.

23:59.410 --> 24:01.380
Mm.

24:02.310 --> 24:05.019
- Hey, Eliot?
- Hm?

24:05.020 --> 24:06.529
Can I talk to you for a sec?

24:06.530 --> 24:07.559
Yeah.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.349
I said I'm fine.

24:11.050 --> 24:14.989
I have been awake for
thousands of hours straight.

24:14.990 --> 24:16.349
Look, I saw your moment back there,

24:16.350 --> 24:18.165
and I think I might know what's up.

24:18.166 --> 24:21.560
You think you do, but you don't.

24:23.030 --> 24:25.959
Okay, so the first two nights, no sleep,

24:25.960 --> 24:27.669
things got a little weird, right?

24:27.670 --> 24:30.510
Like picking up my
phone to call Quentin.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.513
You know, I must've done
that like five times.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.560
But then my brain crossed
over into darker...

24:39.350 --> 24:42.109
Here's the deal.

24:42.110 --> 24:44.879
When the Sister was in me,

24:44.880 --> 24:46.484
I remember everything.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.154
Every bloody second of it.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.719
And usually, I'm good
at pushing it away,

24:51.720 --> 24:54.259
but right now...

24:54.260 --> 24:57.429
it is like a constant
slideshow in the background.

24:57.430 --> 25:00.206
Not fun. El.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.960
The Monster was in you for months.

25:04.580 --> 25:06.490
Well, it was different.

25:07.740 --> 25:10.008
People have different experiences.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.879
All that time was just
one big nap to me,

25:12.880 --> 25:15.309
which... sounds so good right now.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.599
I don't know why you're lying to me.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.810
Or anyone.

25:20.811 --> 25:24.231
I don't know why you're
accusing me of lying.

25:25.660 --> 25:27.459
Okay.

25:27.460 --> 25:30.199
Neither of us have the
bandwidth for this right now,

25:30.200 --> 25:32.072
and I don't trust you.

25:32.073 --> 25:34.449
I don't.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.535
But if you ever do decide to talk,

25:36.536 --> 25:38.640
open door.

25:56.370 --> 25:57.439
Shit.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.869
If I may, lenses can be sensitive

25:59.870 --> 26:01.719
to changes in your
Internal Circumstances.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.396
You may need to adjust
if you're feeling off.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.799
God damn it.

26:06.800 --> 26:07.919
If something is bothering you,

26:07.920 --> 26:09.799
I know I'm not the ideal
person to talk to,

26:09.800 --> 26:11.111
but I am here.

26:11.112 --> 26:14.400
I'm not feeling chatty
at the moment, okay?

26:20.260 --> 26:21.859
Look, you're not the only
one that made a mistake,

26:21.860 --> 26:24.708
'cause clearly it's still bothering me.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.410
It's Fogg.

26:29.930 --> 26:31.299
He's stuck in the Etheric Realm,

26:31.300 --> 26:34.419
and it's my fault.

26:34.420 --> 26:35.960
Henry's in...

26:37.600 --> 26:40.209
He always was a sensualist.

26:40.210 --> 26:44.018
That place is a trap for people
like him, who enjoy, well...

26:44.019 --> 26:46.269
- Getting wasted?
- Mm.

26:46.270 --> 26:48.819
He was trying to quit.

26:48.820 --> 26:50.019
He shouldn't have even been in there.

26:50.020 --> 26:51.402
He was only in there because of me.

26:51.403 --> 26:52.639
And you were only there

26:52.640 --> 26:54.280
because you wanted to help the hedges.

26:55.540 --> 26:58.110
You know, if we're being honest...

26:59.460 --> 27:00.953
I wanted to get high.

27:01.980 --> 27:05.760
Lucky me, that's the only
way into the Etheric Realm.

27:05.770 --> 27:08.339
Fogg just...

27:08.340 --> 27:10.336
tagged along and got unlucky.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.209
That wasn't luck.

27:12.210 --> 27:14.039
I know the Emperor of the Realm.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.139
If he kept Henry behind,

27:15.140 --> 27:17.279
it was because he sensed a flaw in him.

27:17.280 --> 27:18.560
And if he kicked you out,

27:18.570 --> 27:22.223
it was because you were
trying to do something good.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.139
Nothing bores him like goodness.

27:24.140 --> 27:25.179
Yeah, how do you know that?

27:25.180 --> 27:28.229
I spent three years there once.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.940
Jesus.

27:31.960 --> 27:36.550
Before I came to the Library,
my life was... difficult.

27:37.970 --> 27:40.033
The Etheric Realm was an escape.

27:40.034 --> 27:42.029
How did you get out?

27:42.030 --> 27:45.080
I stopped hating myself. Eventually.

27:45.980 --> 27:48.499
And then the Emperor grew bored with me.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.419
Whatever kept Henry there,
those were his demons,

27:51.420 --> 27:53.380
and that is something you couldn't fix.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.460
Well, it doesn't stop me from
feeling like shit about it.

27:57.468 --> 27:59.689
The fact that you feel like shit,

27:59.690 --> 28:01.305
that is why you escaped.

28:02.530 --> 28:04.391
So allow me to be blunt.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.239
Don't waste time on self-pity.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.147
Do what you came to do.

28:11.680 --> 28:12.733
Thanks.

28:15.410 --> 28:17.278
I'll try to be less of a bitch to you.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.906
Mm. If you can.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.619
It's working.

28:31.620 --> 28:33.419
I can see the wards.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.710
This way.

28:41.300 --> 28:45.050
It sounds like he's home.
Look, fair warning...

28:50.900 --> 28:51.980
Who the hell are you?

28:51.981 --> 28:53.909
We're looking for Mayakovsky.

28:53.910 --> 28:56.079
Old, drunk, megalomaniac?

28:56.080 --> 28:57.902
Fondness for knit caps?

28:57.903 --> 28:59.153
Yeah, I'm his daughter.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.780
I didn't realize he...

29:00.781 --> 29:02.679
Fucked my mother? Neither did he.

29:02.680 --> 29:04.449
Should've seen his face
when I came knockin'.

29:04.450 --> 29:07.950
But we're fine now. What do you want?

29:07.955 --> 29:09.455
Can you let us down?

29:09.456 --> 29:10.916
Sure.

29:13.100 --> 29:14.310
Thanks.

29:15.770 --> 29:17.469
Look.

29:17.470 --> 29:19.424
We need to talk to your dad.

29:19.425 --> 29:22.169
He's busy.

29:22.170 --> 29:23.428
On our project.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.409
Look, we think he may be the only person

29:25.410 --> 29:26.723
that can help us save the world.

29:26.724 --> 29:29.889
He put a special magical
bond on a moon rock,

29:29.890 --> 29:31.779
and we need his help to break it.

29:31.780 --> 29:35.857
Wait, please tell me you're
trying to rob Oren Westbrook.

29:35.858 --> 29:38.689
- How do you know that?
- I installed that bond.

29:38.690 --> 29:42.071
Yeah, last nice thing I did
before I dumped his greasy ass.

29:42.072 --> 29:43.689
- That was you?
- What? You dated him?

29:43.690 --> 29:45.992
Don't judge, but yes.

29:45.993 --> 29:48.079
Anyfuck, right after
I installed the bond,

29:48.080 --> 29:49.699
I caught the maid pegging him,

29:49.700 --> 29:52.999
and not the maid I
okayed for threesomes.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.409
- Mm...
- Okay.

29:54.410 --> 29:56.003
So that means you'll help us?

29:57.540 --> 29:58.588
I could.

29:58.589 --> 30:00.589
But I need something from you.

30:00.590 --> 30:01.800
A shade.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.386
Either of yours will do.

30:05.900 --> 30:07.348
What are you gonna do with it?

30:08.349 --> 30:11.267
- Are we gonna get it back?
- No.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.061
- You want my help?
- Mm-hmm.

30:13.062 --> 30:15.855
One shade, payment in advance.

30:15.856 --> 30:17.232
Discuss.

30:29.370 --> 30:32.080
- It's safe.
- Thanks.

30:38.820 --> 30:41.849
Any idea where to find a
medical manual in here?

30:41.850 --> 30:43.779
Unfortunately,
the organizational systems

30:43.780 --> 30:45.840
are down, so it may...

30:54.700 --> 30:56.522
May I?

31:01.570 --> 31:03.153
Hm.

31:05.447 --> 31:08.449
Sometimes I forget you're
a fucking master Magician.

31:08.450 --> 31:10.533
I try to keep the
showboating to a minimum.

31:10.534 --> 31:12.739
Well, the Harmonic Convergence
is in a few hours.

31:12.740 --> 31:15.279
- You know what that means.
- I'll take this to Harriet ASAP.

31:15.280 --> 31:20.299
Tell her if, God forbid,
we can't stop it...

31:20.300 --> 31:22.714
we might need all the hedges we
can get to unfuck everything.

31:37.550 --> 31:40.300
_

31:40.800 --> 31:43.777
_

31:46.080 --> 31:47.479
Desperate times, huh?

31:47.480 --> 31:48.979
Didn't really have much choice.

31:48.980 --> 31:51.409
Hey, uh, Julia?

31:51.410 --> 31:54.119
Can you remind me why I'm
dressed like this, please?

31:54.120 --> 31:55.279
He's been like this all night.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.832
Just running on muffin fumes.

31:58.430 --> 32:00.209
Okay, let's just make sure
we're all on the same page.

32:00.210 --> 32:03.079
Okay? Okay, so Josh, Margo, Penny.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.999
You guys go inside,
loop all the cameras,

32:05.000 --> 32:06.599
open the side door for Natasha.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.968
I'll be outside waiting
with Eliot and Alice.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.809
We won't cast the spell
until your signal.

32:10.810 --> 32:12.263
You won't miss it. Ready?

32:12.264 --> 32:13.730
Break.

32:19.750 --> 32:23.317
Eliot. What are you staring at?

32:24.280 --> 32:27.520
Pull the ripcord, get out.
We'll handle this.

32:27.529 --> 32:28.863
I am not cocking out.

32:28.864 --> 32:31.159
You're not right, El,
and we both know why.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.952
My crippling fear of/
attraction to authority?

32:33.953 --> 32:36.119
Are you being honest with me?

32:36.120 --> 32:38.940
Bambi, always.

32:38.950 --> 32:40.669
I don't care if you've
been keeping it from me,

32:40.670 --> 32:42.418
but all of our asses
are on the line now.

32:42.419 --> 32:44.269
Margo.

32:44.270 --> 32:45.546
Do not worry about me.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.779
I know, I've been a little bit off.

32:47.780 --> 32:49.409
Blame it on the moon brain.

32:49.410 --> 32:51.930
I promise I'm fine.

32:54.280 --> 32:55.430
'Kay?

33:06.693 --> 33:09.154
_

33:27.330 --> 33:28.999
Hey! How are you?

33:36.870 --> 33:37.919
Oh.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.879
Uh, no guests.

33:44.880 --> 33:47.739
Can you fetch me another
plate of those crab puffs?

33:47.740 --> 33:49.799
- Delish.
- Head of security.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.489
- Not your waiter.
- Oh, good for you.

33:52.490 --> 33:53.782
Have you tried the crab puffs?

33:57.550 --> 33:58.596
Hey, my drink!

33:58.597 --> 34:00.159
- What the...
- Watch the suit!

34:00.160 --> 34:02.769
That's the third time
you've done that tonight!

34:02.770 --> 34:04.399
Watch what you're doing!

34:04.400 --> 34:05.649
I'm gonna take you outside right now.

34:05.650 --> 34:08.130
All right, fellas,
break it up, break it up.

34:15.710 --> 34:17.109
I looped that one,

34:17.110 --> 34:19.018
but I don't remember
if I looped that one.

34:19.020 --> 34:20.918
You don't remember five seconds ago?

34:20.920 --> 34:23.353
Josh, I haven't had short-term
memory in two days.

34:24.300 --> 34:25.353
The only things I remember

34:25.355 --> 34:26.799
are being worried about Eliot

34:26.800 --> 34:29.775
and feeling like shit for trying
to leave you in the past.

34:29.775 --> 34:31.069
Really?

34:32.760 --> 34:35.958
Fucking moon brain.

34:35.960 --> 34:37.110
Totally spaced out.

34:37.117 --> 34:38.743
Why are you looking at me like that?

34:38.744 --> 34:40.920
These are good.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.159
Let's go.

34:51.080 --> 34:53.549
It's true. It's true.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.478
Excuse me, sir.

34:55.480 --> 34:57.389
Excuse me.

34:57.390 --> 34:59.129
We have an issue.

34:59.130 --> 35:01.079
Natasha?

35:01.080 --> 35:02.183
What the hell is she doing here?

35:02.184 --> 35:04.602
Well, my men will find out,
but I have a hunch.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.850
There's one thing you own
that only she can steal.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.705
Bring back the rock.

35:30.210 --> 35:32.130
- Stop!
- Wh...

35:32.990 --> 35:34.173
Right there, right there!

35:36.770 --> 35:37.802
Let's go!

35:45.360 --> 35:47.969
Natasha. Where is she going?

35:47.970 --> 35:51.509
For the last time, we don't know.

35:51.510 --> 35:54.111
And even if we did,
we would never admit it.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.698
No bother.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.150
My men have her now.

36:11.545 --> 36:14.588
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What's going on?

36:14.589 --> 36:16.829
- Where's the moon rock?
- What... I don't...

36:16.830 --> 36:17.842
I don't know!

36:17.843 --> 36:19.179
Look, I was just hitchhiking,

36:19.180 --> 36:21.540
and a woman, she just threw
the keys at me, okay?

36:21.550 --> 36:23.306
Just take the van, whatever.

36:25.320 --> 36:26.810
Look, she went that way.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.479
She escaped?

36:32.480 --> 36:33.774
Where's the rock?

36:42.530 --> 36:45.119
Well, I officially have moon brain.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.699
I can see Her aura. It's red.

36:47.700 --> 36:51.219
Let's do this quick
before anyone comes in.

36:51.220 --> 36:52.877
How long do we have to
cast the first part again?

36:52.878 --> 36:56.339
Until Her aura turns green
and She's listening.

37:12.481 --> 37:14.523
It's working.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.740
Where is Natasha taking the rock?

37:22.741 --> 37:24.700
Okay... okay.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.949
She said she was going to Philly.

37:26.950 --> 37:29.994
The only thing worse than
a traitor is a snitch.

37:29.995 --> 37:31.499
You make me wanna puke.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.179
Hey, hey, Josh.

37:33.180 --> 37:35.119
Do you have any more muffins?

37:39.770 --> 37:41.718
Almost there.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.259
We had it.

37:49.260 --> 37:50.351
What happened?

37:50.352 --> 37:52.561
How did it turn red?

37:52.562 --> 37:54.179
Eliot?

37:54.180 --> 37:55.399
Wait, Eliot, come back!

37:55.400 --> 37:57.520
We don't have enough power
to finish this without you.

37:58.270 --> 37:59.920
Eliot.

38:01.640 --> 38:02.990
Eliot...

38:04.870 --> 38:07.827
Let me out.

38:33.870 --> 38:36.909
You're not there.

38:36.910 --> 38:38.650
You're gone forever.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.945
Quentin threw you in the Seam.

38:47.050 --> 38:50.119
This isn't happening.
This is moon brain.

38:58.080 --> 39:00.338
Stop right there!

39:04.470 --> 39:07.080
My guards are in the
room with your friends.

39:07.940 --> 39:10.307
The rock never left, did it?

39:10.940 --> 39:12.609
You know, I want the snitch

39:12.610 --> 39:15.228
to tell me what's really going on.

39:17.980 --> 39:20.649
- What happened?
- Asshole fell asleep again.

39:20.650 --> 39:23.569
His fight-or-flight response
is to take a fucking nap.

39:33.160 --> 39:35.299
Or something else is up.

39:38.940 --> 39:40.569
It wasn't me.

39:43.610 --> 39:45.379
In here, boss.

39:48.380 --> 39:51.379
Marina.

39:51.380 --> 39:53.130
Ladies.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.969
Did you put the guards to sleep?

39:56.970 --> 39:58.319
Yeah,

39:58.320 --> 40:01.231
but I'm a little confused why
you aren't snoozing too.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.818
The only thing stronger
than that spell is...

40:05.400 --> 40:07.614
Oh, my God. Are you on meth?

40:09.320 --> 40:12.359
You know, it sure as hell seems like it.

40:20.377 --> 40:21.542
What are you doing here?

40:21.543 --> 40:23.359
Keeping you from fucking up my shit.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.090
Harmonic Convergence, I need it.

40:28.590 --> 40:29.969
Like Daddy always said,

40:29.970 --> 40:31.971
even meth can't beat handcuffs.

40:31.972 --> 40:33.973
I don't think you understand
how bad the Convergence is.

40:33.974 --> 40:35.929
No, I do.

40:35.930 --> 40:39.311
But what you don't understand
is how good it is for me.

40:39.312 --> 40:40.980
I have a very critical mission,

40:40.981 --> 40:42.839
and I need the power
convergence boost to do it.

40:42.840 --> 40:47.689
So just this one time,
could you please go home?

40:47.690 --> 40:48.979
Look, whatever it is you're doing,

40:48.980 --> 40:50.609
it's not worth the world.

40:50.610 --> 40:51.999
Mm, yes, it is.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.200
I put a shitload of work into this.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.719
I stole a Book Depository,
for Christ sake.

40:55.720 --> 40:56.980
That was you?

40:58.123 --> 41:00.749
You sent that memory assassin after me.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.489
Yeah, and not a life assassin.

41:02.490 --> 41:03.819
You're welcome.

41:03.820 --> 41:07.756
We're even, since you
tipped us to this party.

41:07.757 --> 41:09.299
- Frederick here...
- That's not my name.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.469
Okay, not-Frederick here,

41:12.470 --> 41:14.279
overheard you in my Book Depository

41:14.280 --> 41:16.760
making these exciting plans
for the Convergence.

41:16.766 --> 41:18.308
Speaking of...

41:18.309 --> 41:19.728
just started.

41:22.610 --> 41:25.130
I flinch, it fires.

41:26.776 --> 41:28.444
Oh...

41:28.445 --> 41:30.029
I think we all know what that was.

41:30.030 --> 41:31.079
It's the surge.

41:31.080 --> 41:32.364
You know what that means, Chickee-poo?

41:32.365 --> 41:33.866
Power is insane.

41:33.867 --> 41:35.451
You're holding a nuke right now.

41:35.452 --> 41:37.619
You let that thing go,
we all go bye-bye.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.080
Kady, she's right; with the
Convergence and the surge,

41:40.081 --> 41:42.124
every spell is, like,
super-powered right now.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.879
Yeah, I bet you could
cast something solo

41:44.880 --> 41:46.529
that would normally take three people.

41:46.530 --> 41:49.119
- Isn't that what I just said?
- Marina!

41:49.120 --> 41:51.460
Please, we are so close
to saving everyone.

41:51.468 --> 41:53.260
You can't just take
that away from us now.

41:53.261 --> 41:54.869
Whatever it is you're after,

41:54.870 --> 41:56.973
what's the point if there's no world?

41:56.974 --> 42:00.560
There'll still be a world,
just not as many people.

42:00.570 --> 42:02.849
- Have you met people?
- She's listening!

42:02.850 --> 42:04.519
Eliot, go!

42:04.520 --> 42:07.107
- The fuck are you doing?
- I've got it.

42:07.108 --> 42:09.234
- You're moving the moon?
- Yeah.

42:09.235 --> 42:11.159
I'm moving it back.

42:41.790 --> 42:42.811
Uh...

42:43.960 --> 42:45.340
guys?

42:50.000 --> 42:52.880
I think we just broke the moon.

42:57.540 --> 42:59.700
Ah, shit.
