WEBVTT

02:21.226 --> 02:23.394
Cash in?

02:39.077 --> 02:40.745
Dealer takes another.

02:41.913 --> 02:43.540
With apologies.

02:43.706 --> 02:45.458
Oh, man.

02:58.388 --> 02:59.889
Market research says

03:00.056 --> 03:01.683
we turn tables over 30% faster

03:01.850 --> 03:03.434
and retain on the new shoe.

03:03.601 --> 03:05.061
See?

03:05.228 --> 03:06.938
You don't have to shuffle.

03:07.981 --> 03:09.357
I like to shuffle.

03:09.524 --> 03:11.860
But you don't have to.

03:56.988 --> 03:58.489
Come on, Dummy.

05:38.256 --> 05:40.091
Dealer busts.

05:55.273 --> 05:57.608
- You mind?
- Go ahead.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.948
Cash in, 200.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.787
Uh, excuse me.

06:09.954 --> 06:11.789
Uh, could I get
a gin and tonic, please?

06:11.956 --> 06:13.332
That's your drink?

06:13.499 --> 06:16.127
The best drinks have
self-defining names.

06:16.294 --> 06:18.296
Order a Manhattan,
God knows what you're going to get,

06:18.463 --> 06:20.339
but you order gin and tonic,
Jack and Coke,

06:20.506 --> 06:22.550
it's not just a name,
it's a command.

06:22.717 --> 06:25.678
How long have you been
working here for, uh, Laura?

06:25.845 --> 06:27.513
Four years, plus.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.724
Paid tuition,
then it paid rent.

06:29.891 --> 06:32.435
Ugh! That's bad luck.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.195
Ah. Thank you.

06:43.488 --> 06:44.781
Thank you kindly.

06:50.787 --> 06:52.163
Dealer busts.

06:52.330 --> 06:53.915
Ah.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.043
Alright.

07:04.133 --> 07:06.052
You know, a friend
once told me that those, uh,

07:06.219 --> 07:08.054
"everyone gets quiet
at the same time" moments

07:08.221 --> 07:10.181
only happens at 20 to,
20 past the hour.

07:10.348 --> 07:12.058
Now, I'll be damned
why that happens.

07:12.225 --> 07:14.143
Ghosts flying overhead,
but, uh, check this out.

07:14.310 --> 07:15.645
Hmm. 20 past.

07:15.812 --> 07:17.438
Don't do it.

07:18.481 --> 07:19.607
Sorry?

07:19.774 --> 07:21.484
Those four quarters
you just loaded.

07:21.651 --> 07:23.069
This is not '80s Vegas.

07:23.236 --> 07:25.113
They won't just break your hands
and let you walk away.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.365
They'll prosecute and push
for maximum sentence.

07:27.532 --> 07:30.660
There's a camera there,
camera there, over there.

07:30.827 --> 07:32.662
That old lady in the Terrapins
sweatshirt behind you

07:32.829 --> 07:34.789
is not a grandma.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.209
Dealer shows 16, sir.

07:42.338 --> 07:45.716
They started upgrades from
single table eye six weeks ago

07:45.883 --> 07:47.802
when insurance flagged
what you must have.

07:47.969 --> 07:51.848
So finish your drink,
play one more hand

07:52.014 --> 07:53.432
and leave.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.979
Ooh. Bad luck.

08:20.877 --> 08:22.753
Hey. Hey.

08:23.963 --> 08:26.215
Ha. I kind of thought
you would have left faster.

08:26.382 --> 08:28.467
I was waiting for you.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.219
Oh, boy.

08:30.386 --> 08:32.722
I may have just been
starting my shift.

08:32.889 --> 08:34.765
You could have been
waiting a long time.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.935
Nah, they always put
the pretty ones on the 8-to-4.

08:41.939 --> 08:43.524
Why did you help me?

08:43.691 --> 08:47.945
Uh, because I thought
you were really nice.

08:49.572 --> 08:52.366
No. I didn't. I thought
you were kind of a dick.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.912
You're very cocky
and kind of unlucky, so...

08:56.078 --> 08:58.331
Is this your first time
trying to rob a casino?

08:58.497 --> 09:00.166
A casino? Yeah.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.293
You're really not
very good at it.

09:02.460 --> 09:04.253
I saw you coming a mile off.

09:04.420 --> 09:06.547
Well, next time,
no-one will see me coming.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.257
OK? I will
get a better plan.

09:08.424 --> 09:10.843
And maybe find myself
an inside man.

09:11.010 --> 09:13.596
Oh, are you trying
to recruit me?

09:13.763 --> 09:15.264
You could be
a world-class thief.

09:15.431 --> 09:17.725
No-one suspects people
who look like you.

09:17.892 --> 09:19.393
And what do I look like?

09:19.560 --> 09:23.064
That you'd get anything you wanted
just by asking for it.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.568
What do you say? Huh?

09:29.445 --> 09:31.822
Bet you know that place
inside and out.

09:33.532 --> 09:36.118
Fair's fair.
I'll split the take 50-50.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.378
OK. Better luck next time.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.088
Hang on a minute.

09:48.214 --> 09:49.215
I'm sorry.

09:49.382 --> 09:50.883
I owe you.

09:51.050 --> 09:52.426
You really don't.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.679
Well, I feel beholden.
Let me buy you a drink.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.222
Drinks are free inside.

09:56.389 --> 09:58.933
Drinks are shit inside.
Let's go somewhere.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.227
I don't want to go somewhere.

10:01.394 --> 10:03.145
I want to go home.

10:05.856 --> 10:09.443
Then...take me the fuck home.

10:14.991 --> 10:16.534
Hey, hey, hey.

10:51.694 --> 10:54.613
Hey. Hey, hey.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.407
You OK?

10:59.535 --> 11:00.953
What?

11:24.352 --> 11:25.269
Ah!

12:12.900 --> 12:14.568
So you are a thief.

12:16.278 --> 12:18.781
Just some coffee.

12:18.948 --> 12:20.282
You got a hot tub.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.576
You ever use it?

12:22.743 --> 12:24.286
Uh, yep.

12:27.498 --> 12:29.542
You know, you could do magic
with skills like that.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.503
Nah. I'm not much of a showman.

12:32.670 --> 12:34.713
Yeah. I'm aware.

12:37.383 --> 12:40.136
See now, if I had
those skills and your job,

12:40.302 --> 12:41.720
I could really clean up.

12:43.055 --> 12:45.433
If you had my job,
what would you do?

12:48.144 --> 12:50.479
Well, um...

12:51.647 --> 12:53.816
..the weak spot.

12:53.983 --> 12:56.193
All you need is one.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.945
It's usually people's attention.

13:08.914 --> 13:11.292
Show me.

13:45.701 --> 13:47.912
Thanks, bro.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.586
He's hot.

13:55.753 --> 13:58.422
10 years, Robbie has never
looked at me like that.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.014
You know, if you
keep ignoring him,

14:07.181 --> 14:08.766
he's only going to want more.

14:10.309 --> 14:12.061
Well, there's a lesson
in there somewhere.

14:13.521 --> 14:15.689
My grandma always had cats.

14:16.732 --> 14:19.360
She said that they could
see ghosts when we can't,

14:19.527 --> 14:21.278
and warn you of thieves.

14:21.445 --> 14:23.155
Yeah?

14:24.198 --> 14:25.783
Hey, hey.

14:25.950 --> 14:27.076
Hey.

14:28.494 --> 14:30.120
I think your cat's broken.

14:33.958 --> 14:35.834
Do you ever worry
about what will happen

14:36.001 --> 14:37.378
if you keep stealing?

14:37.545 --> 14:39.630
Like in the afterlife?

14:39.797 --> 14:41.423
Knocking down
too many Commandments?

14:41.590 --> 14:43.801
No. I mean, like, jail.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.306
Do you believe in the afterlife?

14:50.349 --> 14:51.767
I don't know.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.520
I mean, my mom did.
She seemed pretty sure.

14:54.687 --> 14:56.522
She used to say, uh,

14:56.689 --> 14:59.567
"All I know is
there's more than I know."

15:00.609 --> 15:02.653
Yeah, I think that might
sound wiser than it is.

15:02.820 --> 15:05.698
Oh, wow. OK, wise-ass.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.367
So you know what happens
after you die?

15:08.534 --> 15:10.244
- Yes, I do.
- OK, what?

15:10.411 --> 15:12.246
You rot.

15:13.289 --> 15:14.832
When you die, you rot.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.667
And you're so sure?

15:16.834 --> 15:18.210
Whoo-hoo!

15:18.377 --> 15:20.337
Yeah. I mean,
it's...it's a fixed system.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.548
Physics doesn't
take Sundays off.

15:22.715 --> 15:25.301
So you don't believe
in anything?

15:25.467 --> 15:27.469
There's nothing to believe.

15:27.636 --> 15:30.681
Trust me. I've looked.

15:30.848 --> 15:34.059
I mean, my parents
believed in everything.

15:34.226 --> 15:36.103
Father, Son, Holy Ghost,

15:36.270 --> 15:38.230
spirit-filled and full
of the light of God.

15:38.397 --> 15:39.940
Hallelujah.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.568
They taught me all of it,
chapter and verse.

15:42.735 --> 15:45.029
I went to bed every night
in a world full of magic

15:45.195 --> 15:46.614
where anything was possible.

15:46.780 --> 15:50.200
And then one day you find out
that Santa's not real,

15:50.367 --> 15:52.703
and then the Tooth Fairy
isn't real.

15:52.870 --> 15:55.623
And there's no farm upstate
for old dogs.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.292
Then I started
reading history books,

15:58.459 --> 15:59.835
and Jesus isn't real.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.378
And it's like everything

16:01.545 --> 16:03.714
that made the world
anything more than what it is

16:03.881 --> 16:06.300
is just...is just stories.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.469
Just snake oil,

16:08.636 --> 16:10.346
but worse
because snakes are real.

16:12.806 --> 16:15.100
I wanted to get
that magic back so bad,

16:15.267 --> 16:18.062
but...one day
I just accepted the fact

16:18.228 --> 16:22.191
that I couldn't because life
is just not that interesting.

16:25.653 --> 16:27.446
Don't look at me like that.

16:28.489 --> 16:29.907
Like what?

16:31.492 --> 16:34.161
It's like you're a lost puppy.

16:36.455 --> 16:38.082
That was fun, puppy.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.126
The fun is just getting started.

16:42.753 --> 16:44.296
Come here.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.852
No, no, no.
Guys don't get it.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.980
They think Krav Maga is a Jew thing.
It's a mind thing.

17:02.147 --> 17:05.067
Maximum effectiveness,
maximum efficiency,

17:05.234 --> 17:07.069
how to dismantle your opponent
in any situation.

17:07.236 --> 17:08.946
Maybe that is
a Jew thing, though.

17:09.113 --> 17:10.614
They did survive
all kinds of shit.

17:10.781 --> 17:12.408
Plus it's an insane workout.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.785
You're between jobs.
You should come down to my gym.

17:14.952 --> 17:16.870
Let me teach you
in one of my classes.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.331
- I could teach you to fight.
- I can fight.

17:19.498 --> 17:21.417
- Not Krav Maga fight.
- I box.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.377
Hmm. You good?

17:24.670 --> 17:26.672
You teach?

19:41.807 --> 19:43.183
You want coffee?

19:43.350 --> 19:44.726
Hmm?

19:44.893 --> 19:46.144
Coffee?

19:46.311 --> 19:48.522
Come on. Come get it.

19:48.689 --> 19:50.065
- Hmm?
- Come on.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.192
Out here.

19:58.115 --> 19:59.867
I need you to sit.

20:02.870 --> 20:04.246
Are we pregnant?

20:04.413 --> 20:07.082
Puppy, sit.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.428
What I'm about to say
may sound irrational to you,

20:19.595 --> 20:21.847
but I have all sorts of
rational reasons for saying it

20:22.014 --> 20:23.348
and then doing it.

20:23.515 --> 20:25.058
So say it,

20:25.225 --> 20:28.395
and let's talk about
whether or not you should do it.

20:29.771 --> 20:32.858
Do you remember when
you asked me to be your inside man?

20:34.443 --> 20:36.320
You want to rob the casino?

20:36.486 --> 20:38.363
I think I need to.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.366
I mean, I haven't
come to this lightly.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.410
I've been eliminating options
one by one

20:43.577 --> 20:45.621
before I came
to my final decision.

20:45.787 --> 20:48.832
And...I mean, final
may be the wrong word.

20:48.999 --> 20:52.544
Are we discussing,
or are you telling?

20:52.711 --> 20:55.756
Well...there's some wiggle room.

20:56.798 --> 20:58.592
This is desperate.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.761
OK? This...this is
some desperate bullshit.

21:00.928 --> 21:02.596
Are you unhappy?
'Cause I'm happy.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.181
OK? You make me happy.

21:04.348 --> 21:06.183
Yes, I see that you're happy

21:06.350 --> 21:09.102
from this side of it,
from the wrong side of it,

21:09.269 --> 21:12.773
and I think maybe
I resent not being happy.

21:12.940 --> 21:16.526
Not resent you. Just...resent.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.658
Do you still love me?

21:22.824 --> 21:24.576
Yeah, I still love you.

21:24.743 --> 21:26.495
I'm just not happy.

21:26.662 --> 21:29.581
And robbing the casino
will make you happy?

21:31.249 --> 21:33.126
We are like a history book.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.379
We're established fact.
We don't change.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.464
We live in the same town
that I grew up in,

21:37.631 --> 21:39.091
in my dead grandma's
shitty house.

21:39.257 --> 21:41.510
You have a shitty job.
I have a shitty job.

21:41.677 --> 21:43.178
And I want more.

21:43.345 --> 21:47.349
I would be happy
living in a cardboard box

21:47.516 --> 21:49.476
under a freeway
as long as I was with you.

21:49.643 --> 21:51.561
See, that would represent
a failure to me.

21:51.728 --> 21:54.189
I represent failure to you?

21:54.356 --> 21:55.774
Well, no.

21:55.941 --> 21:58.443
I mean, if anything,
you're actually too good for me.

21:58.610 --> 22:01.029
I mean, I'm the girl
who brought home a thief.

22:01.196 --> 22:04.241
I'm not the thief. OK?
Not anymore.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.994
Not at this very moment, no,
but that's what we're discussing.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.413
What are we discussing?

22:11.289 --> 22:13.291
I have worked there
for eight years.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.377
I can tell you
every single thing

22:15.544 --> 22:17.129
that every person
in that building

22:17.295 --> 22:18.839
is going to do and when.

22:19.006 --> 22:20.882
I can tell you
what they look for.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.926
I can tell you what they see.

22:23.093 --> 22:25.429
Eight years
of predictive behaviour.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.347
The night that we first met,

22:27.514 --> 22:29.391
you walked into that casino
with the right ambition,

22:29.558 --> 22:31.059
but you had a stupid plan.

22:31.226 --> 22:34.271
I have a smart plan.
I have a perfect plan.

22:34.438 --> 22:37.816
You will never get caught.

22:38.859 --> 22:40.444
How did you get caught?

22:40.610 --> 22:42.195
Bad luck is how.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.740
Cops came is how.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.450
No, they shouldn't have seen.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.535
They should not have known.
Something went wrong.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.414
It happened. OK?
The plan wasn't perfect.

22:52.581 --> 22:55.834
The plan was perfect.
It was a perfect plan.

22:56.001 --> 22:57.836
Somebody fucked us.

23:03.383 --> 23:04.926
I spoke to Adelstein
this morning.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.553
Fuck, I told you not to.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.889
- And he told me about the deal.
- I'm not taking it.

23:09.056 --> 23:11.183
I'd get no more than three years.
One and a half served.

23:11.349 --> 23:12.726
- You'd get the same.
- No.

23:12.893 --> 23:15.103
You would get the same
and then we'd be back to our lives

23:15.270 --> 23:17.189
in a year and a half,
maybe less.

23:17.355 --> 23:18.982
You are not going to prison.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.529
I asked you to do this.

23:24.696 --> 23:27.240
I asked you to do it,
and you did it.

23:28.283 --> 23:30.535
And if I hadn't, you would
be on the couch right now.

23:30.702 --> 23:32.537
Yeah, but I said yes.

23:33.622 --> 23:35.499
OK? You asked, but I said yes.

23:35.665 --> 23:39.127
I did it. I got caught, not you,
and that is our luck.

23:39.294 --> 23:42.005
You'll get six years. Six years.

23:42.172 --> 23:44.299
I will be out in three.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.346
I can take it.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.475
If you're on the other side,

23:53.642 --> 23:55.602
I can make it if you can.

23:56.937 --> 23:58.355
Hey.

23:58.522 --> 24:00.524
Can you wait for me?

24:05.070 --> 24:07.280
Yeah. Yes.

24:26.883 --> 24:27.843
Hello.

24:28.009 --> 24:29.386
<i>You have a collect call</i>

24:29.553 --> 24:31.471
<i>from Woodward Federal
Correctional Institution.</i>

24:35.142 --> 24:36.893
Hello.

24:39.437 --> 24:40.313
Hello.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.815
<i>You have a collect call</i>

24:41.982 --> 24:43.567
<i>from Woodward Federal
Correctional Institution.</i>

24:51.241 --> 24:52.826
All good.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.457
Fuck you, Dummy.

25:51.009 --> 25:53.845
Hey, yeah, he's, uh,
all taken care of.

25:54.012 --> 25:55.931
I put him
in the woods out back,

25:56.097 --> 25:58.433
and marked him with a...stone,

25:58.600 --> 26:00.727
in case you want
to, like, go visit him.

26:00.894 --> 26:02.270
Is that legal?

26:02.437 --> 26:04.898
To just bury animals
in the yard?

26:05.065 --> 26:06.650
Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's fine.

26:06.816 --> 26:08.985
You should see all the pets
we have in our yard.

26:14.741 --> 26:17.827
Just glad that I could be here
to help you, you know?

26:17.994 --> 26:19.913
Both of us, Audrey and I.

26:24.709 --> 26:26.086
Hey.

26:26.253 --> 26:27.963
Don't stay here alone tonight.

26:28.129 --> 26:30.507
Come on.
Come crash on the couch.

26:30.674 --> 26:32.467
Uh...

26:32.634 --> 26:34.594
No. I'm fine here.

26:38.932 --> 26:40.558
Fuck.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.313
I didn't even like him.

26:55.115 --> 26:56.741
I know this sucks.

26:56.908 --> 26:58.743
We miss Shadow too.

26:58.910 --> 27:01.246
You guys are our best friends,
you know that?

27:17.929 --> 27:19.472
Uhh.

27:20.515 --> 27:21.891
The cat just died.

27:22.058 --> 27:24.227
I don't know why I even did it.

27:24.394 --> 27:27.564
I'm drunk and alone,
and my fucking cat just died.

27:27.731 --> 27:29.149
Fuck. I'm sorry.

27:30.734 --> 27:32.235
Are you...

27:37.240 --> 27:38.783
..sorry?

28:20.658 --> 28:24.245
I told Audrey you had to move
some furniture around, so...

28:24.412 --> 28:26.539
Why did you say that?

28:27.582 --> 28:29.376
Because I wanted
to see you again?

28:30.418 --> 28:32.420
Come on, Robbie.
Say what you mean.

28:33.463 --> 28:34.964
I don't know.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.050
You wanted to come here
and fuck me some more?

28:37.217 --> 28:38.843
Is that what you want?

28:39.010 --> 28:40.887
Yeah.

28:41.054 --> 28:43.181
Last night was a one-time thing.

28:43.348 --> 28:47.018
You were there, and thank you,
but we're not doing this.

28:47.185 --> 28:50.271
We did this, and it happened.

28:50.438 --> 28:53.608
And now I'm waiting for Shadow.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.276
I get it.

28:55.443 --> 28:57.153
You're waiting for Shadow.

28:57.320 --> 28:58.863
Do you?

29:00.907 --> 29:02.200
Yeah.

29:07.747 --> 29:10.041
Say it again.

29:11.126 --> 29:12.836
You're waiting for Shadow.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.965
OK. Come in.

29:23.972 --> 29:25.640
<i>You have a collect call</i>

29:25.807 --> 29:28.393
<i>from Woodward Federal
Correctional Institution.</i>

29:28.560 --> 29:30.562
- Hello.
<i>- I love you.</i>

29:30.728 --> 29:32.689
<i>Something feels weird.</i>

29:32.856 --> 29:35.525
I love you too.
What feels weird?

29:35.692 --> 29:38.653
<i>I don't know. Um, the weather.</i>

29:39.737 --> 29:41.156
<i>The air feels constipated,</i>

29:41.322 --> 29:43.700
<i>like if it'd just push out a storm,
it'd be OK.</i>

29:43.867 --> 29:45.410
Yeah, there's a special word

29:45.577 --> 29:47.954
for the kind of dread
caused by constipated air.

29:48.121 --> 29:49.998
It's nice here.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.459
Trees are budding.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.878
There'll be leaves on them
when you get back.

29:56.212 --> 29:57.839
<i>Five days.</i>

29:58.006 --> 30:00.383
120 hours and you're home.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.598
<i>Everything's OK there, right?</i>

30:07.724 --> 30:10.059
Waiting for the sky to fall
is going to cause more bother

30:10.226 --> 30:13.396
than the sky actually falling,
which it isn't.

30:13.563 --> 30:15.356
<i>Yeah. So nothing's wrong.</i>

30:15.523 --> 30:17.525
Everything's fine.

30:17.692 --> 30:19.444
Robbie's coming by.

30:19.611 --> 30:21.779
We're planning
your surprise party.

30:21.946 --> 30:23.490
Welcome home.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.284
<i>A surprise party?</i>

30:26.451 --> 30:27.952
Which you know nothing about.

30:28.119 --> 30:32.123
<i>Not a thing.</i>

30:32.290 --> 30:34.042
I love you, puppy.

30:35.126 --> 30:36.669
<i>I love you too.</i>

30:50.850 --> 30:52.393
Get dressed.

31:03.738 --> 31:05.198
I'll leave Audrey.

31:05.365 --> 31:06.741
Yeah.

31:06.908 --> 31:08.826
And you... And you tell Shadow.

31:08.993 --> 31:11.871
And they'll be angry,
but they will understand.

31:12.914 --> 31:14.958
Or they'll freak out.
I don't care.

31:15.124 --> 31:16.584
I'm not doing that.

31:16.751 --> 31:18.127
You're not doing that.

31:18.294 --> 31:20.213
Shadow's coming back
in five days.

31:20.380 --> 31:22.549
- I'm going to be there for him.
- But you don't love him.

31:22.715 --> 31:24.842
- Yeah, I do.
- Not the way he loves you.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.597
We talked about this, Robbie.

31:29.764 --> 31:31.599
You knew this had
an expiration date,

31:31.766 --> 31:33.476
and you agreed to the terms.

31:35.395 --> 31:37.188
Yeah, I felt differently then.

31:38.982 --> 31:40.275
I don't.

31:41.401 --> 31:43.861
That's not true.

31:44.028 --> 31:45.863
Jesus Christ, Robbie.

31:49.158 --> 31:54.414
You just have to think of this
as like a sweet memory.

31:55.623 --> 31:57.542
Like a naughty little secret.

31:57.709 --> 31:59.168
Something you think about

31:59.335 --> 32:00.878
when you're old
and you're worried

32:01.045 --> 32:02.797
that you never did anything
with your life.

32:02.964 --> 32:04.757
You did.

32:04.924 --> 32:06.718
You fucked around
and you didn't get caught.

32:06.884 --> 32:08.428
It was really fun.

32:09.470 --> 32:11.222
Huh. Is that all this was?

32:11.389 --> 32:12.849

34:34.741 --> 34:36.826
Now you are dead, Laura Moon.

34:37.869 --> 34:40.455
The circumstances
of your death commit me.

35:19.452 --> 35:22.288
I must take your heart.

35:22.455 --> 35:24.290
I must weigh your heart.

35:24.457 --> 35:26.375
Against a feather?

35:28.294 --> 35:30.296
I can already tell you who wins.

35:32.632 --> 35:36.010
I lived my life good and bad,

35:36.177 --> 35:38.513
definitely not
light as a feather.

35:46.771 --> 35:48.439
Where are you going?

35:48.606 --> 35:50.691
Where am I going?

You pass through.

36:10.586 --> 36:12.046
Where do I pass through?

36:12.213 --> 36:15.132
In life,
you believed in nothing.

36:15.299 --> 36:17.176
You will go to nothing.

36:17.343 --> 36:18.803
You will be done.

36:18.970 --> 36:20.513
There will be darkness.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.390
And peace?

36:22.557 --> 36:24.851
There will be darkness.

36:27.103 --> 36:29.355
You know what? No.

36:29.522 --> 36:31.440
There is nowhere else
for you to be.

36:31.607 --> 36:33.860
Well, I'm not getting in there.
I want to go back.

36:35.278 --> 36:37.989
Already your flesh
has been moved,

36:38.155 --> 36:41.367
has been cut by the doctors
who inspected your organs.

36:41.534 --> 36:44.161
Already your loved ones
have selected for you

36:44.328 --> 36:46.706
the clothes
to shroud your decomposition.

36:46.873 --> 36:48.583
Already you are in the ground.

36:48.749 --> 36:50.751
Tears have fallen for you.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.258
Do I get a say in this?

36:57.425 --> 37:00.052
Death is not a debate.

37:00.219 --> 37:03.347
How many do you think
have come before you,

37:03.514 --> 37:08.185
all with promises and threats
and offers of glory, gold, love?

37:08.352 --> 37:11.272
Who are you to misguide me
from my duty?

37:11.439 --> 37:14.066
You are but a man,
not even one I should remember.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.193
You will go into the darkness,

37:16.360 --> 37:18.571
and I will forget
ever having met you.

37:21.532 --> 37:23.868
Fuck y...

38:09.705 --> 38:11.457
Oh, my God, that's disgusting.

39:42.381 --> 39:43.924
Fuck.

45:07.539 --> 45:09.583
Hmm.

45:49.915 --> 45:51.500
Laura?

45:54.336 --> 45:55.796
Hey, Audrey.

46:02.761 --> 46:05.764
Audrey!

46:05.931 --> 46:08.142
Audrey. Don't call the police.

46:08.308 --> 46:10.227
Get out of my house,
you zombie whore!

46:10.394 --> 46:12.771
Audrey, please
don't call the police, OK?

46:12.938 --> 46:14.523
I'm going to come in now.

46:14.690 --> 46:16.108
No!

46:16.275 --> 46:17.901
I'm going to come in now, OK?

46:18.068 --> 46:19.653
No!

46:19.820 --> 46:21.905
Hey, Audrey? Audrey?

46:22.072 --> 46:24.241
- Audrey?
- What?! Go away!

46:24.408 --> 46:25.784
What the fuck are you?!

46:25.951 --> 46:27.161
Audrey, this would be
embarrassing

46:27.327 --> 46:28.454
under any circumstance,

46:28.620 --> 46:29.788
but it's particularly
embarrassing

46:29.955 --> 46:31.457
under this circumstance.

46:31.623 --> 46:33.542
Nevertheless, I really
need to use your toilet.

46:34.710 --> 46:36.378
What?!

46:37.421 --> 46:38.964
Oh, please, no.

46:39.131 --> 46:41.592
- It's OK.
- No! Oh, my God!

46:41.758 --> 46:43.177
It's OK.

46:45.304 --> 46:47.514
Ahhh!

46:51.852 --> 46:53.187
It's embalming fluid.

46:54.396 --> 46:56.106
It's coming out
of every hole I got.

46:56.273 --> 46:57.816
It's very disgusting,
so please turn around.

46:57.983 --> 46:59.776
Turn around.

46:59.943 --> 47:02.321
Ahh!

47:08.785 --> 47:11.038
How are you here?

47:11.205 --> 47:12.873
I don't know.

47:13.040 --> 47:15.250
Well, you know you're dead,
though, right?

47:15.417 --> 47:16.835
I assumed, yes.

47:17.878 --> 47:21.507
Well, are you dead now,
or are you something else?

47:21.673 --> 47:24.218
I would say...the latter.

47:24.384 --> 47:27.262
Well, is this a haunting?
You haunting me?

47:27.429 --> 47:28.972
Not on purpose.

47:30.015 --> 47:31.600
I needed craft supplies.

47:39.107 --> 47:40.734
Laura?

47:40.901 --> 47:42.486
Yes, Audrey.

47:42.653 --> 47:45.572
What's the last thing
you remember before you died?

47:46.615 --> 47:48.200
Um...

47:50.369 --> 47:51.620
Oh.

47:52.663 --> 47:53.830
Oh?

47:53.997 --> 47:55.707
Yeah.

47:57.751 --> 47:59.503
Is Robbie dead?

48:00.546 --> 48:02.047
Oh, yes.

48:02.214 --> 48:03.840
Is he still dead?

48:04.007 --> 48:05.842
He's...

48:09.179 --> 48:10.722
I mean, he was.

48:10.889 --> 48:12.975
I, uh...I haven't seen him.

48:13.141 --> 48:16.478
Don't know what either of you
are up to now.

48:19.690 --> 48:21.525
You know, I guess I never did.

48:22.568 --> 48:24.152
You know what we were up to.

48:24.319 --> 48:26.405
Oh, I know who was in your mouth
when you died.

48:26.572 --> 48:28.991
- I do know that.
- Does everybody know that?

48:29.157 --> 48:32.035
Yeah. Well, everyone
who attended your funeral.

48:32.202 --> 48:34.162
I may have mentioned it
just once or twice

48:34.329 --> 48:35.956
during the service.

48:36.123 --> 48:38.333
Does Shadow know?

48:39.501 --> 48:42.963
Yeah, he knows. I tried
to fuck him on your grave.

48:43.130 --> 48:45.340
Seemed only fair.

48:45.507 --> 48:47.593
Yeah, that does seem fair.

48:49.136 --> 48:51.013
I'm not proud of myself.

48:53.181 --> 48:56.560
I, uh...I had Robbie
buried with his penis,

48:56.727 --> 48:58.520
you know, that you...
you bit off,

48:58.687 --> 49:00.188
shoved up his ass.

49:00.355 --> 49:03.191
It was vulgar.
I'm a vulgar woman.

49:03.358 --> 49:07.738
Anger and grief have...have
really just made me vulgar.

49:09.906 --> 49:11.408
I...

49:12.451 --> 49:14.536
Laura, I found out
that you and Robbie

49:14.703 --> 49:18.582
were dead and having an affair
in the same sentence.

49:19.875 --> 49:21.293
Maybe it wasn't
the same sentence.

49:21.460 --> 49:22.919
It was the same breath.

49:23.962 --> 49:25.505
Might have been
a run-on sentence.

49:25.672 --> 49:28.050
God, you know,
I should thank you.

49:28.216 --> 49:30.177
I should thank both of you.

49:30.344 --> 49:31.845
It's so much easier
grieving someone

49:32.012 --> 49:33.764
when you're glad they're dead.

49:41.438 --> 49:43.357
Thoughtful of you
to make us a scrapbook.

49:43.523 --> 49:44.858
Fuck you, Laura.

49:45.901 --> 49:49.196
I make scrapbooks
because memories lie.

49:50.238 --> 49:53.617
I wish I had a picture of you
fucking Robbie for the album.

49:53.784 --> 49:55.619
I'd glue it down, glitter it,

49:55.786 --> 49:57.954
give it a little
pipe cleaner matte.

49:59.331 --> 50:01.875
- I feel terrible.
- Oh, fuck your feelings.

50:02.042 --> 50:04.294
Everyone has feelings.
Everyone cares about what they feel.

50:04.461 --> 50:05.962
I don't care
about what you feel.

50:06.129 --> 50:07.631
I care about what you think.

50:07.798 --> 50:09.633
What do you think
about what you did?

50:09.800 --> 50:11.718
I think I did a shitty thing.

50:11.885 --> 50:13.512
I think I fucked you over,

50:13.679 --> 50:15.722
but I did not mean
to fuck you over.

50:15.889 --> 50:17.474
It wasn't even about you.

50:17.641 --> 50:19.601
Yeah, why would it be?

50:20.644 --> 50:22.312
God, I thought
you were my best friend.

50:22.479 --> 50:24.690
Robbie and I had a fight,
you'd be the first one to know,

50:24.856 --> 50:27.067
and all the time you were
fucking him behind my back.

50:27.234 --> 50:29.778
- Not all the time.
- You lied to me about it.

50:29.945 --> 50:32.197
You open your mouth,
and lies come spitting out.

50:32.364 --> 50:33.740
I told one lie.

50:33.907 --> 50:37.119
In all of this,
I told one big umbrella lie

50:37.285 --> 50:39.955
under which there were
many smaller lies.

50:40.122 --> 50:42.290
And what was your big lie,
Laura?

50:43.792 --> 50:45.752
I told Shadow
that I could wait for him.

50:49.131 --> 50:51.216
Um...

50:51.383 --> 50:54.219
Listen, I know you're really
pissed at me right now.

50:55.679 --> 50:57.806
But I kind of need
to borrow your car.

51:05.689 --> 51:08.108
"Laura Moon, age 27,
of Eagle Point, Indiana,

51:08.275 --> 51:10.193
"was killed in the early hours
of Wednesday morning

51:10.360 --> 51:11.570
"in an automobile accident.

51:11.737 --> 51:14.406
"Laura loved her work,
her friends and her family."

51:14.573 --> 51:17.284
Are you fucking kidding me?
Who wrote this shit?

51:17.451 --> 51:19.786
There's little
to no effort here.

51:19.953 --> 51:22.247
"She loved her work,
her friends and her family"?

51:22.414 --> 51:25.125
That's just lazy.
That's fucking lazy writing.

51:25.292 --> 51:27.335
And it's not entirely true.

51:28.628 --> 51:30.380
I have a shitty obituary.

51:30.547 --> 51:34.468
Well, you had a shitty obituary
'cause you had a shitty life.

51:34.634 --> 51:36.052
You were shitty.

51:36.219 --> 51:37.721
I was not that shitty.

51:37.888 --> 51:39.431
How could you live
with yourself?

51:39.598 --> 51:41.183
I mean, when you were
actually living?

51:41.349 --> 51:42.768
Well, evidently I couldn't.

51:42.934 --> 51:44.936
How do you think you're
going to live with Shadow?

51:45.103 --> 51:46.813
Presumably your stalking him

51:46.980 --> 51:48.648
will come
to some sort of fruition.

51:48.815 --> 51:50.692
I mean, what then?
What, happy family?

51:50.859 --> 51:53.361
Little zombie baby?
Like, a zombie dog?

51:54.446 --> 51:56.364
I'll have
my own private sunshine.

51:57.407 --> 51:59.409
Laura, you wiped
your ass with that sunshine.

51:59.576 --> 52:01.161
Shadow deserves better than you.

52:01.328 --> 52:03.079
I love Shadow. Loved Shadow.

52:03.246 --> 52:06.291
Love Shadow. I love Shadow.

52:07.793 --> 52:09.461
He's the light of my life.

52:11.963 --> 52:13.673
What?

52:13.840 --> 52:16.343
You did not love him
when you were alive.

52:16.510 --> 52:19.638
Come on. Not love him love him.
He was like a pet.

52:19.805 --> 52:21.723
There's a reason
you called him puppy.

52:21.890 --> 52:25.852
Yeah. Well, I love him now.

52:51.837 --> 52:54.005
You I remember.

53:07.978 --> 53:11.147
We are a small
family-owned funeral home.

53:11.314 --> 53:14.150
What we provide is continuity.

53:14.317 --> 53:16.278
There has been
an Ibis and Jacquel

53:16.444 --> 53:18.530
in business here for 200 years.

54:05.827 --> 54:08.538
Pins for the bones.

54:15.170 --> 54:17.213
Threads for the muscles.

54:24.220 --> 54:26.556
Paint for the skin.

54:30.060 --> 54:32.604
We need to tend to your flesh
as best we can

54:32.771 --> 54:34.773
as it can't tend
to itself anymore.

54:34.940 --> 54:37.525
Care and maintenance is needed
for your dead body.

54:39.361 --> 54:42.113
However, there is nothing
we can do

54:42.280 --> 54:44.324
to lighten your heavy heart.

54:44.491 --> 54:46.117
Uh, don't move.

54:46.284 --> 54:47.953
You're still tacky.

54:50.330 --> 54:52.207
Your heavy heart
sank you like a stone

54:52.374 --> 54:54.334
right back
where you last left off.

54:54.501 --> 54:56.461
Lived a life interrupted.

54:56.628 --> 54:58.338
Was it love?

54:58.505 --> 55:00.590
It wasn't.

55:01.675 --> 55:03.927
But I suppose it is now.

55:04.094 --> 55:05.679
That is unfortunate.

55:05.845 --> 55:09.641
Love will always have you
at a disadvantage.

55:09.808 --> 55:12.185
Well, I think being dead
has me at a disadvantage.

55:12.352 --> 55:14.229
Uh, many is the man

55:14.396 --> 55:16.648
who would take any version
of his lost love

55:16.815 --> 55:18.900
rather than leave his love lost.

55:19.067 --> 55:20.568
He will say thank you

55:20.735 --> 55:22.988
to whatever god
sent you back to him.

55:34.290 --> 55:35.917
When you are done...

55:37.127 --> 55:39.129
..I will complete my task

55:39.295 --> 55:41.923
and deliver you on to darkness.

57:11.387 --> 57:12.972
Hi, puppy.
