00:12.832 --> 00:13.999
Bleh!

00:14.067 --> 00:16.568
Maurice, this smoothie is the yuck!

00:16.636 --> 00:17.970
Make me a better one!

00:18.038 --> 00:19.337
You got it, your majesty!

00:19.405 --> 00:22.374
Hmm, I'll make you a better one.

00:29.983 --> 00:31.349
Uh, heh, heh!

00:31.417 --> 00:33.685
Mmm!

00:33.752 --> 00:37.522
Now, that is a smoothie
I can call groovy!

00:37.590 --> 00:40.858
That's 'cause of the
secret ingredient.

00:40.926 --> 00:43.961
It's the same smoothie, just grosser.

00:44.029 --> 00:45.230
Got ya, Maurice!

00:45.298 --> 00:47.599
I just don't feel right about this!

00:47.667 --> 00:49.634
Shh!

00:53.839 --> 00:56.274
âª You made a mistake 
When you messed with me âª

00:56.342 --> 00:58.276
âª Should have known better 
And let it be âª

00:58.344 --> 01:00.378
âª Making up choices
is what it involves âª

01:00.446 --> 01:01.379
âª So look out, baby âª

01:01.447 --> 01:02.380
âª Here comes the claws âª

01:02.448 --> 01:03.381
âª Yeah âª

01:03.449 --> 01:05.016
âª Here comes the claws âª

01:05.084 --> 01:06.484
âª Yahoo âª

01:06.552 --> 01:11.054
âª Here comes the claws âª

01:11.122 --> 01:13.224
Embarrassing, Marlene.

01:13.291 --> 01:14.858
Quite embarrassing!

01:14.926 --> 01:16.159
I still don't feel right.

01:16.228 --> 01:18.262
Shh, shh!

01:18.330 --> 01:21.298
(Snoring)

01:24.769 --> 01:26.203
(Grumbling)

01:26.271 --> 01:28.805
Whaa?

01:28.873 --> 01:29.806
Okay, Mr. Bunny.

01:29.874 --> 01:34.445
Time to make night-night!

01:34.512 --> 01:37.281
(Mumbling)

01:37.349 --> 01:41.017
I think he likes his bunny, hey?

01:41.085 --> 01:42.352
Interesting!

01:42.419 --> 01:47.090
I just don't feel... Shh, shh, shh!

01:47.158 --> 01:51.094
Gentlemen, Operation:
Sneaky Peek is a success!

01:51.162 --> 01:54.430
We now have sensitive intel
on every animal in the zoo.

01:54.498 --> 01:57.134
But Skipper, aren't the
animals our friends?

01:57.201 --> 02:00.137
Young Private, a friend is
just an enemy who hasn't

02:00.204 --> 02:01.738
attacked yet.

02:01.806 --> 02:03.740
That's not very friendly thinking.

02:03.808 --> 02:04.741
I know!

02:04.809 --> 02:06.243
Why are they attacking us?

02:06.310 --> 02:09.012
This collection of sordid
secrets guarantees that we'll

02:09.080 --> 02:11.580
have the upper flipper when they do.

02:11.648 --> 02:14.817
Still, holding these secrets
is an awesome responsibility.

02:14.885 --> 02:18.620
If any were to leak,
it would be chaos.

02:18.688 --> 02:22.124
That's why I'm classifying
Operation: Sneaky Peek tip-top,

02:22.192 --> 02:25.194
tippy-top top-secret.

02:25.262 --> 02:26.361
Oh!

02:26.429 --> 02:27.429
Wow!

02:27.497 --> 02:30.099
Oh, that's even more secretive
than your delicious

02:30.167 --> 02:31.733
monkfish surprise recipe.

02:31.802 --> 02:33.002
Exactly!

02:33.069 --> 02:36.638
So, if anyone asks, you
didn't see anything!

02:36.706 --> 02:37.873
(Knocking)

02:37.941 --> 02:40.709
Uh, Skipper?

02:40.777 --> 02:44.913
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and...
Private, put a little hustle in

02:44.980 --> 02:46.881
your muscle!

02:46.949 --> 02:48.516
Uh, sorry, Skipper.

02:48.583 --> 02:49.684
Didn't sleep well last night.

02:49.751 --> 02:52.353
I kept thinking about Operation:

02:52.421 --> 02:55.323
Sneaky... Private!

02:55.390 --> 02:57.658
Those words must never
be spoken aloud!

02:57.726 --> 02:58.693
Sorry!

02:58.760 --> 02:59.727
Tell you what.

02:59.795 --> 03:02.263
Skip the callisthenics, and
go get yourself some chow.

03:02.331 --> 03:03.998
Aye, aye, Skipper!

03:04.066 --> 03:06.234
Tender-hearted tenderfoot.

03:06.302 --> 03:10.271
Kowalski, make a note to wring
that tenderness right out of him!

03:10.339 --> 03:11.472
Aye, aye, Skipper.

03:11.540 --> 03:14.174
(Sighing)

03:14.242 --> 03:17.410
Hmm, needs a little something.

03:17.478 --> 03:19.012
Hot sauce, perfect!

03:19.080 --> 03:21.614
That ought to give these
sardines a little kick.

03:21.682 --> 03:24.918
Mmm, not bad!

03:24.986 --> 03:27.855
Good workout, men!

03:27.922 --> 03:28.856
Tesla's coil!

03:28.923 --> 03:29.857
Oh!

03:29.924 --> 03:30.858
(Hiccupping)

03:30.925 --> 03:33.861
Please, tell me you didn't consume
the contents of this bottle.

03:33.928 --> 03:35.362
I did.

03:35.429 --> 03:36.429
The hot sauce was very tasty!

03:36.497 --> 03:37.797
This wasn't hot sauce!

03:37.866 --> 03:38.798
It was truth serum!

03:38.867 --> 03:42.369
You put truth serum in
a hot sauce bottle?

03:42.436 --> 03:43.569
Of course!

03:43.636 --> 03:46.839
Hot sauce is truth serum, grape
jelly is sleeping gas, and

03:46.907 --> 03:49.976
ketchup is amnesia mist.

03:50.043 --> 03:51.410
Where was I?

03:51.478 --> 03:52.511
And what's mustard?

03:52.579 --> 03:55.748
Well, it's a tangy condiment
you put on your hot dog.

03:55.815 --> 03:57.583
Mmm, sounds delicious.

03:57.650 --> 04:00.186
Point is, for the next few hours,
Private will be unable to

04:00.254 --> 04:03.055
do anything but tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but

04:03.123 --> 04:04.190
the truth.

04:04.258 --> 04:05.258
Observe.

04:05.325 --> 04:08.361
Private, do you honestly like
Skipper's monkfish surprise?

04:08.428 --> 04:11.163
No, it tastes like elephant sweat.

04:11.231 --> 04:14.799
But everyone pretends to like to
to spare Skipper's fragile ego.

04:14.867 --> 04:18.435
My whole life is a lie!

04:18.504 --> 04:24.075
So, we've established the
effectiveness of the truth serum.

04:24.143 --> 04:26.544
Okay, okay, this won't be a problem.

04:26.612 --> 04:30.448
I mean, it's not like we have
anything to hide, right?

04:30.516 --> 04:31.983
Ahem!

04:32.051 --> 04:33.218
Oh, yeah!

04:33.286 --> 04:34.452
Help!

04:34.520 --> 04:36.922
A desperate cry for help!

04:36.989 --> 04:39.624
Move out, men!

04:39.691 --> 04:41.492
Private, mum's the word.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.929
Okay, Skipper!

04:43.996 --> 04:46.096
I don't know how he got in
there, but if we don't get him

04:46.164 --> 04:47.697
out soon, he'll be buried alive!

04:47.765 --> 04:49.166
Help!

04:49.234 --> 04:50.834
Mmm, yum!

04:50.902 --> 04:53.437
I am, mmm, trapped!

04:53.504 --> 04:55.639
Ladder formation on 3!

04:55.706 --> 04:58.608
Uno, deux, 3!

05:01.446 --> 05:02.913
(Laughing)

05:02.981 --> 05:04.514
I'm buttery!

05:04.582 --> 05:06.683
(Cheering)

05:06.751 --> 05:08.518
Yay!

05:08.586 --> 05:10.287
Oh, thank you, penguins!

05:10.355 --> 05:14.023
I was really getting worried
about the poppity corn!

05:14.091 --> 05:15.891
Sure, happy to help.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.126
Now, if you'll excuse us.

05:17.194 --> 05:18.894
Why the rush?

05:18.963 --> 05:20.363
Stay and celebrate!

05:20.431 --> 05:22.198
No can do.

05:22.266 --> 05:23.199
Big fish to fry!

05:23.267 --> 05:24.300
Come on!

05:24.368 --> 05:26.802
What, are you actually afraid
you're going to have some fun?

05:26.870 --> 05:29.638
No, Marlene, Skipper's afraid
I'll tell everyone your

05:29.706 --> 05:30.639
embarrassing secret.

05:30.707 --> 05:32.208
Secret?

05:32.276 --> 05:33.376
What secret?

05:33.444 --> 05:37.013
That you fancy yourself a pop
superstar, and perform imaginary

05:37.081 --> 05:38.381
concerts every night.

05:38.449 --> 05:41.017
How do you guys know about that?

05:41.085 --> 05:42.385
Have you been spying on me?

05:42.453 --> 05:44.086
Enough with the blabbermouth!

05:44.153 --> 05:48.056
No, Marlene, we haven't
been spying on you.

05:48.124 --> 05:50.158
We've been spying on everyone!

05:50.226 --> 05:52.894
(Gasping)

05:52.962 --> 05:55.197
We know all your secrets.

05:55.264 --> 05:57.665
Bing sucks his thumb.

05:57.733 --> 06:01.669
Bill cheats at chess!

06:01.737 --> 06:05.040
The spider monkeys
aren't even half-spider!

06:05.108 --> 06:06.408
Ooh!

06:06.476 --> 06:09.544
These are very embarrassing
secrets we are hearing!

06:09.612 --> 06:12.080
Julian picks his nose!

06:12.148 --> 06:16.083
Ahh, my secret gold-digging
shame exposed!

06:16.151 --> 06:18.119
Get him!

06:18.186 --> 06:19.921
Mason is really Canadian!

06:19.989 --> 06:23.424
Bert has a... Oh, no, you don't!

06:23.492 --> 06:26.794
I don't want anybody
knowing about that tattoo!

06:26.862 --> 06:33.668
I was young and foolish, and... hey!

06:33.736 --> 06:38.139
Look, tell anybody about my
Tijuana vacation, and I swear,

06:38.206 --> 06:42.176
buddy boy, I'll stomp you into paste!

06:42.244 --> 06:43.845
Kowalski, secure the private!

06:43.913 --> 06:46.347
Aye, aye, Skipper!

06:46.415 --> 06:48.682
(Grunting)

06:48.750 --> 06:49.983
Here he is!

06:50.052 --> 06:52.420
And there he goes!

06:52.487 --> 06:56.223
Speak to me the most
juiciest of the gossips!

06:56.291 --> 06:59.960
Mort loves you just for your feet.

07:00.028 --> 07:02.663
It's true!

07:02.730 --> 07:04.165
It's all true!

07:04.232 --> 07:05.566
Well, duh!

07:05.633 --> 07:07.068
Come on, more with the spilling!

07:07.135 --> 07:10.171
And Maurice secretly...
Okay, thanks for coming!

07:10.238 --> 07:11.205
Bye!

07:11.273 --> 07:14.608
What was he going to say, Maurice?

07:14.676 --> 07:19.079
That secretly, I, uh, think
you're the greatest king that

07:19.146 --> 07:20.113
ever lived!

07:20.181 --> 07:21.181
Pssh!

07:21.248 --> 07:24.051
Maurice, that is no secret!

07:26.353 --> 07:27.988
Rico, about face!

07:28.056 --> 07:30.290
(Tires screeching)

07:30.357 --> 07:31.959
(Splashing)

07:32.026 --> 07:35.161
Okay, so all I want to know is,
do you know about the... Yes.

07:35.229 --> 07:37.163
And how I like to... Yes.

07:37.231 --> 07:39.165
With the... Yes.

07:39.233 --> 07:40.166
You know what?

07:40.234 --> 07:41.167
Not cool, guys.

07:41.235 --> 07:42.168
No, not cool at all!

07:42.236 --> 07:43.169
Friends don't spy on friends!

07:43.237 --> 07:44.871
I am so embarrassed!

07:44.939 --> 07:47.474
If you think that's
embarrassing, you should see

07:47.541 --> 07:52.645
what Kowalski does when he
thinks no one's watching.

07:52.713 --> 07:53.846
Rico, floor it!

07:53.914 --> 07:56.616
(Tires screeching, crashing)

07:56.683 --> 08:00.019
Not in reverse.

08:00.087 --> 08:03.823
Well, should be smooth
sailing from here.

08:03.890 --> 08:05.125
Whoa!

08:05.192 --> 08:07.227
(Growling)

08:07.294 --> 08:08.661
Eee!

08:08.729 --> 08:12.098
Bail out, men!

08:15.836 --> 08:18.270
(Grumbling)

08:18.338 --> 08:21.039
Kowalski, status on the angry mob!

08:21.107 --> 08:22.407
Mob still there.

08:22.475 --> 08:24.109
Mob still angry.

08:24.177 --> 08:26.512
Ugh!

08:26.579 --> 08:28.113
Hello, what's all this, then?

08:28.181 --> 08:29.448
Private!

08:29.516 --> 08:31.016
Welcome back from la-la land!

08:31.083 --> 08:33.018
Um, thanks?

08:33.085 --> 08:34.219
Was I gone?

08:34.287 --> 08:36.921
Yep, and you accidentally
spilled the beans on Operation:

08:36.989 --> 08:38.423
Sneaky Peek.

08:38.491 --> 08:40.558
Oh, yes, I remember.

08:40.626 --> 08:41.826
Sorry, Skipper.

08:41.894 --> 08:43.227
Not to worry, Private.

08:43.296 --> 08:46.131
We'll just stay safely locked up
in here until this whole thing

08:46.199 --> 08:50.135
is... whoa!

08:50.203 --> 08:52.804
You penguins are going to pay
for violating our inalienable

08:52.872 --> 08:55.406
rights of privacy, and whatnot!

08:55.474 --> 08:58.710
Oh, what am I supposed to do now?

08:58.778 --> 09:01.212
What's this?

09:01.280 --> 09:05.216
Amnesia spray, fantastic!

09:05.284 --> 09:07.018
What's this?

09:07.086 --> 09:10.588
Amnesia spray, fantastic!

09:10.656 --> 09:12.290
What's this?

09:12.357 --> 09:16.227
Amnesia spray, fantas... tic?

09:16.295 --> 09:19.964
Hey, should I sit on them
individually, or do I go for the

09:20.032 --> 09:21.465
group squish?

09:21.533 --> 09:23.234
Why drag it out?

09:23.302 --> 09:24.969
I say one, and done!

09:25.037 --> 09:26.269
Kowalski!

09:26.337 --> 09:27.537
Options!

09:27.605 --> 09:28.939
Get fresh air while you can.

09:29.007 --> 09:30.674
(Inhaling)

09:30.742 --> 09:32.176
Okay, here we go!

09:32.243 --> 09:33.911
I'm dropping booty!

09:33.978 --> 09:35.412
Ahh!

09:35.479 --> 09:36.646
Hey, what's that?

09:36.715 --> 09:37.647
Hear something?

09:37.716 --> 09:38.882
Forget!

09:38.950 --> 09:40.017
I hear it, too!

09:40.085 --> 09:41.418
Forget, everybody!

09:41.485 --> 09:44.454
Forget!

09:44.522 --> 09:48.458
What... am I doing?

09:48.526 --> 09:51.394
I'm feeling a little
discombobulated here.

09:51.462 --> 09:54.765
Ooh, I'm kind of dizzy myself.

09:54.833 --> 09:59.236
I'm going to sit down right
here... (Muffled screaming)

09:59.303 --> 10:02.505
What have we done to deserve this?

10:02.573 --> 10:05.308
Watch where you park
that thing, pachyderm!

10:05.376 --> 10:07.577
Sorry, didn't see you there!

10:07.645 --> 10:10.079
What are we doing here?

10:10.147 --> 10:11.381
I don't know!

10:11.449 --> 10:14.284
I can't... remember?

10:14.352 --> 10:15.452
I remember!

10:15.519 --> 10:17.287
It is a party!

10:17.355 --> 10:18.521
A party for me!

10:18.589 --> 10:21.424
A me-esta, if you will!

10:21.492 --> 10:23.960
A you-esta, olÃ©!

10:24.027 --> 10:26.529
Now, where are my gifts?

10:26.597 --> 10:30.031
Present me with the presents, already!

10:30.099 --> 10:31.833
(Sighing)

10:31.901 --> 10:34.035
You know, it's weird.

10:34.103 --> 10:38.006
I can't remember a thing
from the last week.

10:38.074 --> 10:41.710
Ah, if it was worth remembering,
we'd remember it.

10:41.778 --> 10:44.980
Rico, might I have a stick on TNT?

10:45.047 --> 10:46.014
Yep!

10:46.082 --> 10:47.616
(Coughing)

10:47.684 --> 10:50.753
Thanks.

10:50.820 --> 10:52.421
(Explosion)

10:52.489 --> 10:54.222
Private, what was that?

10:54.291 --> 10:55.391
Nothing, Skipper.

10:55.458 --> 10:56.625
Just my little secret.

10:56.825 --> 11:00.025
