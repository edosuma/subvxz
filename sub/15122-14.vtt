WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:03.504
(Hope crying)

00:19.353 --> 00:20.488
What are you doing?

00:20.554 --> 00:22.123
(whispers):
I'm hiding from Maw Maw.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.393
Stay away from my husband!

00:25.459 --> 00:27.428
Maw Maw! We have been
through this!

00:27.495 --> 00:29.763
This is not your husband!

00:29.830 --> 00:30.864
Zip it, harlot!

00:30.931 --> 00:33.134
Wilfred, get back in our bed
where you belong.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.136
Aw. I'll sneak out
first chance I get.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.304
Will you wait up?

00:36.370 --> 00:37.871
Considering the only reason
we're here

00:37.938 --> 00:40.274
is 'cause I lost to you
in a game of Yahtzee, no.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.010
This is kinda nice.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.178
You're always
laughing at me

00:44.245 --> 00:45.379
when she thinks I'm
her dead husband.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.115
Not so funny when it's you.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.517
I'm not finding it
quite as humorous, no.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.718
Well, good luck.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.486
You might want to put
a little hot sauce on your neck,

00:52.553 --> 00:54.255
'cause if she catches you,

00:54.322 --> 00:57.191
that's where she
likes to lick.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.127
Hey, Jimmy.
Yeah, Dad?

00:59.193 --> 01:01.095
You think this kind of stuff
happens in other people's houses

01:01.162 --> 01:02.496
in the middle of the night

01:02.563 --> 01:04.064
and they're just too embarrassed
to talk about it?

01:04.132 --> 01:05.766
I hope so.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.201
Me, too.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.069
Good night.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.273
Good night.

01:12.340 --> 01:13.507
MAW MAW:
Wilfred!

01:21.282 --> 01:24.452
Wow, has it been 15 years? Wow.

01:24.518 --> 01:27.221
Jimmy check out this feather
I found in the front yard.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.190
I think it just fell out.
It's still warm.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.691
Who is that?
Who's on the phone?

01:30.758 --> 01:32.092
Who you talking to?

01:32.160 --> 01:33.361
I'm sorry
I won't be here.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.596
Uh, I have to work.
Burt, gross!

01:35.663 --> 01:37.965
That's dirty-- just popped
out of a bird's butt.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.333
Who are you talking to?

01:39.400 --> 01:40.601
Would you stop it?

01:40.668 --> 01:41.802
Stop it!

01:41.869 --> 01:43.971
Okay, I will let them know
you are on the way over.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.374
Bye.
Who was that?
Who's on the way over?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.008
Your cousin Delilah.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.378
What?! No, no, no!

01:50.444 --> 01:51.379
Why did you tell her
she could...?

01:51.445 --> 01:52.713
How far away is she?

01:52.780 --> 01:54.081
I don't know. Close.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.115
I think.

01:55.183 --> 01:57.418
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:57.485 --> 01:59.753
This is bad. This is bad.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.622
Burt, do my thing.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.194
(sighs)

02:06.260 --> 02:08.028
Did she ask about Maw Maw?

02:08.095 --> 02:09.630
I don't think so.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.998
Did she ask about...?!

02:11.064 --> 02:12.032
No!

02:12.099 --> 02:13.334
What's going on?

02:13.401 --> 02:14.735
This is really bad.
This is really bad!

02:14.802 --> 02:15.769
Stop it!

02:15.836 --> 02:17.705
Just tell us
what's going on.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.173
You have to understand

02:19.240 --> 02:20.841
my relationship with my cousin.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.447
She would come stay with us
every summer

02:26.514 --> 02:27.481
when we were kids.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.217
And she had the best outfits,

02:29.283 --> 02:32.620
while I had to wear crap
Maw Maw made.

02:34.255 --> 02:40.494
* My, my, my Delilah *

02:40.561 --> 02:45.399
* Why, why, why, Delilah... *

02:45.466 --> 02:47.668
For six whole weeks,

02:47.735 --> 02:49.603
Maw Maw made me treat Delilah
like company.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.472
I don't know how anyone
can sleep

02:51.539 --> 02:53.341
in this cheap little bed.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.642
Well, you want
to trade?

02:54.708 --> 02:57.211
I'm sleeping on the stuffed
frog down here.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.280
No, that's stupid.

02:59.347 --> 03:02.182
You're stupid.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.419
By the time I was a teenager,

03:05.486 --> 03:07.321
I finally got to pick out
my own clothes,

03:07.388 --> 03:09.923
but I had other setbacks
to contend with.

03:09.990 --> 03:13.160
And my cousin was a big shot
because she had a beeper.

03:13.227 --> 03:18.098
One day, we'll all communicate
with only beepers and beeps.

03:18.165 --> 03:20.200
That's when we met Burt.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.047
He was a god.

03:34.114 --> 03:36.550
(all sigh)

03:36.617 --> 03:39.687
And Delilah got to date him.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.625
We're going swimming
at Lake Wheeler tomorrow,

03:44.692 --> 03:47.160
and I'm gonna let him go
to second base.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.562
Don't worry,
cripple cousin,

03:48.629 --> 03:50.764
I'll tell you all about it.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.102
She'd already beaten me
to first base,

03:55.168 --> 03:58.205
she wouldn't beat me to second.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.740
Hey.

03:59.807 --> 04:03.043
Delilah told me to tell you
that she's on her period,

04:03.110 --> 04:05.913
has diarrhea and decided
to become a lesbian.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.916
But I like lakes.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.686
I finally had something
that Delilah didn't.

04:12.753 --> 04:16.324
* Forgive me, Delilah,
I just couldn't take any more *

04:19.126 --> 04:24.398
* Forgive me, Delilah,
I just couldn't take any more! *

04:24.465 --> 04:29.002
I loved him! I loved him!

04:29.069 --> 04:30.538
We went to the lake.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.674
Second base was so much fun,
I waved him around to third.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.743
She seemed to be
a big fan of third,

04:35.809 --> 04:37.978
so I just rounded the base
and slid into home.

04:38.045 --> 04:38.912
Stop.
Headfirst.

04:38.979 --> 04:39.980
Stop.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.715
He cured my scoliosis.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.452
So that's why your cousin
Delilah can't come over?

04:44.518 --> 04:45.686
No, I had to give you
the background

04:45.753 --> 04:47.087
before I could tell you
the rest.

04:47.154 --> 04:51.692
Delilah never came back again,
but she always made sure

04:51.759 --> 04:54.928
I knew how great her life was:
family vacations,

04:54.995 --> 04:59.667
a two-year accredited college
in Iowa City,

04:59.733 --> 05:02.570
a job in the tallest building
in Scottsdale

05:02.636 --> 05:04.405
and business trips everywhere
from Tulsa

05:04.472 --> 05:07.608
to glamorous
eastern Lake Erie.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.377
Her life was amazing.

05:09.443 --> 05:12.413
Mine... not so much.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.050
BURT:
Careful!

05:17.117 --> 05:18.686
(guys laughing)

05:18.752 --> 05:20.888
Hey, how you doing in there?
Can you breathe?

05:20.954 --> 05:22.623
This is awesome!

05:22.690 --> 05:23.791
BURT:
Check it out.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.827
We got off work early,
had a few ales,

05:26.894 --> 05:27.961
and then Marcus
and I bet Jimmy

05:28.028 --> 05:30.297
that he couldn't fit a boot
on his head.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.165
Whoa! That's a huge zit!

05:32.232 --> 05:33.601
I know what it is.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.870
Hang on, Jimmy,
I'm coming to Boot Town!

05:39.407 --> 05:41.041
(guys laughing)

05:41.108 --> 05:43.577
Stay away from my campsite,
you bears!

05:43.644 --> 05:46.980
Maw Maw, do not start a fire
in the living room.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.649
(phone rings)

05:48.716 --> 05:50.418
I am wasted!
Hello.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.386
Ginny! Delilah!

05:52.453 --> 05:54.121
Blast from the past!

05:54.187 --> 05:56.657
I'm on a stopover
between Tampa and Milwaukee.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.192
Huge pharmaceutical conference
up here

05:59.259 --> 06:00.594
in the old lake country.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.229
It's not far from you,

06:02.295 --> 06:04.665
and my company's paying
for a car rental, so I figured

06:04.732 --> 06:06.099
why not come down
and see how Maw Maw's doing.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.835
(flames whooshing)

06:07.901 --> 06:10.438
Plus I'd love to see how life's
treating you, sweetheart.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.814
Maw Maw's dead.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.116
(whistles)

06:23.183 --> 06:25.653
Well, I couldn't have her
come over

06:25.719 --> 06:27.755
and see what a mess my life was.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.090
You both had boots
on your head.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.024
It's your fault, too.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.126
I don't know, Mom.
I mean, wow.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.596
Fine. I screwed up.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.130
Saying someone's
grandma's dead...

06:37.197 --> 06:39.667
I said I screwed up
and it was stupid.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.934
Can we move past that?!

06:41.001 --> 06:43.003
You guys do way stupider stuff
all the time,

06:43.070 --> 06:44.538
and I don't harp on it.

06:44.605 --> 06:45.739
You harp all the time,

06:45.806 --> 06:48.108
about Hope
and the serial killer.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.042
You're a huge harper.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.511
Why are you both
ganging up on me?

06:50.578 --> 06:51.845
(doorbell rings)

06:51.912 --> 06:54.882
What?! How the hell
did she get here already?!

06:54.948 --> 06:57.785
Your story did kinda
take forever.

07:04.324 --> 07:05.459
(doorbell ringing)

07:05.526 --> 07:08.161
We gotta sneak Maw Maw
out of here.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.963
BURT:
Just tell Delilah
you lied.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.466
I lied to keep
from being humiliated.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.702
If she finds out
I lied about Maw Maw,

07:14.768 --> 07:16.403
then I'll be even more
humiliated.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.905
It's a vicious cycle,

07:17.971 --> 07:19.773
but it's not a vicious cycle
I'm willing to break.

07:21.341 --> 07:26.013
(cricket chirping)

07:26.079 --> 07:27.881
(crunching)

07:27.948 --> 07:30.117
BURT:
I'm not taking Maw Maw.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.819
Ever since she thinks
I'm Wilfred,

07:31.885 --> 07:34.121
she's having a real problem
keeping her hands to herself.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.956
(doorbell rings)
And apparently, he was into
some really unpleasant stuff.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.424
VIRGINIA:
No, you stay here.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.660
You're better at acting fake
friendly to people we hate.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.394
No, I can't take her.
I have to work.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.830
You take her with you.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.799
Sometimes family has to make
sacrifices for each other.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.067
Like the one my
lower body made

07:47.134 --> 07:49.169
pushing out that beach
ball-size head of yours.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.304
You owe me for that.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.807
You owe us both for that.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.280
Hey, Delilah.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.182
Burt! Well, hey!

08:02.249 --> 08:03.617
Hey!

08:03.684 --> 08:06.286
Wow, the years sure have been
kind to you, mister!

08:06.353 --> 08:07.655
I was hoping you'd be fat

08:07.721 --> 08:12.392
and bald,
but no, you are hot and hairful!

08:12.459 --> 08:14.562
Delilah, you
look good, too.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.163
Yeah, well, I work at it.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.365
Plus being a pharmaceutical rep,
I pretty much gotta test

08:18.431 --> 08:20.267
every new weight-loss drug
they come out with.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.770
The new one I'm on,
I can eat a whole pie

08:22.836 --> 08:24.304
and it's back out in an hour.

08:24.371 --> 08:25.773
Hey, we got pie. Come on in.

08:27.575 --> 08:31.278
Wherever you go in life,
there's gonna be mean girls.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.213
They will try to tear you down.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.784
But what you have to do
is be strong and confident

08:36.850 --> 08:39.787
and never be afraid
to be yourself.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.161
Let's do this.

08:48.228 --> 08:52.332
Yeah, we keep the room
just the way she had it.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.034
Kind of a Maw Maw memorial.

08:55.435 --> 08:56.804
Hey, Grandma!

08:56.870 --> 08:58.939
Burt told me you're
a grandma now.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.408
How's it feel being a grandma,
you ol' grandma?!

09:01.474 --> 09:02.576
It feels fantastic.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.877
Well, that
little thing

09:03.944 --> 09:05.979
must have you running around
like crazy.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.650
You look exhausted and skinny
as ever, you poor thing.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.785
(cellophane crinkles)

09:11.852 --> 09:12.953
Did you just crinkle?

09:13.020 --> 09:16.156
I spend a lot of time
in the sun.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.096
Hey, I'll be right back.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.397
I just got her an orange soda
and a pie,

09:24.464 --> 09:26.734
and now I'm gonna lock her
back up in my van.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.035
I don't know why
you're hiding her.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.870
Barney's gonna be gone all day
training

09:29.937 --> 09:31.772
for the Big Brother/Little
Brother Tandem Bicycle Race.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.140
Oh, hey, I know.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.042
You should make her
the store greeter.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.544
People love it when old people
say hi to them.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.146
That is such a good idea.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.781
She loves strangers,
which is everyone

09:40.848 --> 09:43.016
because she can never remember
who anyone is.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.084
Come on.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.285
(chuckles)

09:45.352 --> 09:47.921
All right, Maw Maw,
you just gotta smile

09:47.988 --> 09:50.223
and welcome people
into the store.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.396
Welcome, big nose
and fat friend!

09:56.463 --> 09:58.932
Welcome, lady and ugly baby.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.367
Welcome!

10:00.433 --> 10:02.535
Ooh, you smell bad.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.737
Deodorant's on aisle three.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.939
What's up, lesbos?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.675
Hey, honey, I hope you're nice
to your husband

10:07.741 --> 10:09.576
'cause he could have done
a lot better.

10:09.643 --> 10:12.245
Hey, dancing freak!

10:12.312 --> 10:15.683
Welcome. Sorry,
we don't sell chins.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.618
Welcome. Want to see my ass?

10:20.688 --> 10:23.290
Wow.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.825
Thanks, Delilah.

10:24.892 --> 10:28.628
Yeah, pot holders
and laser pointers

10:28.696 --> 10:30.430
with the name
of a wiener drug on them.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.900
You really went all out.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.168
Well, a polite houseguest
never shows up empty-handed.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.904
Woodforall is based
out of Tulsa.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.505
If you ever find yourself
in the area, Burt,

10:38.571 --> 10:41.174
there's a house band
at the airport Sheraton

10:41.241 --> 10:42.943
that'll make you swear
you've met Phil Collins.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.712
I love going near the airport.

10:44.778 --> 10:48.849
VIRGINIA:
Okay, how about let's just cut
the hoo-ha, can we?

10:48.916 --> 10:51.418
You haven't been here
in 15 years. Why now?

10:51.484 --> 10:54.021
When Maw Maw died,
it was a crazy time for me--

10:54.087 --> 10:56.857
corporate restructuring,
a kitchen remodel

10:56.924 --> 10:59.459
and I had areola-reduction
surgery

10:59.526 --> 11:01.161
that was only half successful,

11:01.228 --> 11:03.864
so I was a little too distracted
to ask to see the will.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.400
(coos)

11:07.467 --> 11:10.103
I'm gonna go see
if we have any pie.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.072
(chuckles)

11:12.139 --> 11:14.942
There is no will.
What?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.409
Well, after you told me she
died, you sent me that box

11:16.476 --> 11:17.878
with the four quilts in it,

11:17.945 --> 11:19.346
but I just figured
that was part of the will.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.715
I just figured
that was all you needed.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.283
With your fancy job,

11:23.350 --> 11:26.219
you probably got piles
in some Dow Jones account.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.955
Well, I had close
to $200,000 in '06,

11:28.021 --> 11:31.624
but as you know, that was before
the stock market dipped.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.026
My relationship
to the stock market

11:33.093 --> 11:37.630
is like a tiny little ant's
relationship to, um...

11:37.697 --> 11:38.932
the stock market.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.068
We got chicken
potpie.

11:41.134 --> 11:44.071
I know it's not the pie
we were talking about...
Burt.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.939
She's got a trick
she does with pies.
Burt!

11:46.006 --> 11:48.475
I have an upside-down mortgage,
Virginia, and a nipple

11:48.541 --> 11:50.811
with a quarter-inch pleat
that I have to fix.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.479
I am due
my part of the estate.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.715
The estate? This is the estate.
You want half of this?

11:55.783 --> 11:57.017
I want what is fair.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.386
I deserve this house.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.889
While you were off
living the high life,

12:01.955 --> 12:04.024
jet-setting everywhere
from-from Dallas

12:04.091 --> 12:06.760
all the way to Fort Worth,
I was here for 20 years

12:06.827 --> 12:07.895
taking care of Maw Maw.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.897
Which was no day at the beach.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.132
Maybe it was, though,
I don't know.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.034
I have never had a day
at the beach.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.903
So, I guess we have
to call some lawyers.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.071
Fine. Then they'll take
everything in fees

12:18.138 --> 12:19.739
and we'll both get nothing.

12:23.443 --> 12:26.213
I know you've got plastic
wrap wrapped around that belly.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.685
(bike bell rings)

12:32.752 --> 12:34.788
Oh, hey, Barney.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.223
Frank is your little brother?

12:36.289 --> 12:39.759
Yeah. My father left
a few months ago.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.594
It was devastating.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.063
Oh, man. Is your mom okay?

12:43.130 --> 12:45.532
She's fine.
She went with him.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.134
They moved to Florida.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.136
The biking helps him
work off his anger
from the trauma.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.839
Sabrina could you
turn around for a moment?

12:52.973 --> 12:56.376
These bike pants have
a mind of their own.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.122
Why would you let her in there?

13:09.189 --> 13:10.590
Just trying to pass
the time, man.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.026
James!

13:13.093 --> 13:14.361
Unless there's
some special

13:14.427 --> 13:16.329
on aged meats
I don't know about,

13:16.396 --> 13:18.065
would you please remove
your great-grand-Maw Maw

13:18.131 --> 13:19.232
from the deli case?!

13:21.001 --> 13:23.971
I may need
some personal time today.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.811
Virginia still changing
the baby?

13:31.879 --> 13:35.048
(sighs)

13:35.115 --> 13:37.951
Listen, you weren't really
serious about taking

13:38.018 --> 13:39.552
half this house, were you?

13:39.619 --> 13:41.855
I mean, I know
you and Virginia
don't get along,

13:41.922 --> 13:44.091
but she's just a little jealous
of you, that's all.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.758
She always felt like
you had everything.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.961
I didn't have everything.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.196
I didn't have you.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.530
She doesn't want
me to take part

13:50.597 --> 13:52.265
of a house she feels is hers?

13:52.332 --> 13:54.067
Well, I feel she took something
that was mine.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.169
What are you getting at here?

13:56.236 --> 13:58.305
I don't want to fight
about his house.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.940
There'll be lawyers involved,
they'll take everything

14:00.007 --> 14:01.374
and you'll be out
on the street.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.010
Tell you what.

14:03.076 --> 14:06.746
You want to keep my
half of the estate?

14:06.813 --> 14:09.482
Then I want a little
piece of you.

14:14.922 --> 14:17.024
Virginia!

14:21.328 --> 14:24.097
You want Burt
to go to second
base with you?

14:24.164 --> 14:26.199
I want what I would've
had at Lake Wheeler.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.602
Are you that starved
for physical affection?

14:29.669 --> 14:31.004
Yes. And I hate you.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.373
Look, you have my offer,
think about it.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.675
In the meantime,
I'm gonna go out
and get myself

14:35.742 --> 14:37.110
a nice Brazilian wax.

14:37.177 --> 14:40.113
Just because your hands
have to stay above my waist

14:40.180 --> 14:42.149
doesn't mean mine have to.
(clicks tongue)

14:46.653 --> 14:48.421
Whoa. Nice job not punching her.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.824
You're not considering this,
are you?

14:51.891 --> 14:54.161
I'm just looking at what's on
the table here.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.504
(whispers): Second base--
that's under the bra.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.506
Who knows what kind
of nipple drama I'm
gonna find under there?

15:06.573 --> 15:09.009
If the tables were turned,
I would do it for you.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.643
You'd go to second
with my cousin Paul?!

15:10.710 --> 15:12.845
This day is blowing my mind.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.481
I'm not saying I would want to.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.349
Are you sure?
'Cause it came up
pretty quick.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.219
Paul has neck hair and a chin
the size of a flip-flop,

15:19.286 --> 15:21.721
but I would French the hell
out of that circus freak

15:21.788 --> 15:23.090
if our house was at stake!

15:23.156 --> 15:25.158
Can't you just tell her
the truth?

15:25.225 --> 15:28.028
We'll just be in the same spot
when Maw Maw does die.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.463
And, plus, if Delilah
finds out I lied,

15:30.530 --> 15:32.099
she's just gonna try and use it
against us in court.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.833
It's just a big, hot wet mess.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.502
(stammers)

15:35.568 --> 15:37.937
Baby, I screwed up.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.406
I'm so sorry.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.374
Fine.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.776
I'll go to second base
with your cousin.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.845
But if it's okay with you,

15:45.912 --> 15:47.947
I'm gonna be thinking
about your pretty cousin Cathy.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.983
No, that's not okay with me.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.884
How about Aunt Rhonda?
She's your aunt.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.820
Do whatever you want.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.155
Okay.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.262
Thanks so much for helping me
take care of Maw Maw.

16:02.329 --> 16:06.333
Oh, no problem. Thanks for this
great deli spread.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.536
Besides, I'll just get out
the finger paints and the music.

16:09.602 --> 16:10.770
(engine starts)

16:10.837 --> 16:12.505
No, no, no!

16:22.615 --> 16:24.517
(yelling)

16:31.058 --> 16:32.892
(farts)

16:32.959 --> 16:35.395
All these years
I thought if I ever got

16:35.462 --> 16:36.763
to touch another
woman's breast,

16:36.829 --> 16:37.864
it would be my freebie.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.700
And if you ever run into
Xena: Warrior Princess,

16:40.767 --> 16:42.169
you still have my blessing.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.770
Just like you still have
my blessing

16:43.836 --> 16:46.339
if you ever meet former Olympic
hero Greg Louganis.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.081
Ready to hand-tenderize
my she-meat?

16:54.147 --> 16:55.382
I'm all plucked.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.184
Oh, and I want you to wear this.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.921
How dare she expect me
to put a bag over my head.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.656
Like she's some prize package.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.459
Oh, wait,
there's clothes in here.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.562
The good news is
there was only, like,

17:09.629 --> 17:11.564
a couple gallons
of gas in my moped.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.533
How many miles per gallon
does it get?

17:13.600 --> 17:14.567
Three hundred.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.569
I was hoping
you wouldn't ask that.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.339
Hey, Sarge,
I lost another one.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.974
An 84-year-old woman
on a moped.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.910
Hair color?

17:23.976 --> 17:25.245
Will you just let me know

17:25.312 --> 17:27.214
if you find an 84-year-old woman
on a moped?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.516
There she is!

17:29.582 --> 17:30.683
(tires screech)

17:34.987 --> 17:37.524
Hey!

17:39.859 --> 17:42.195
Dancing Dan, where
did you get that moped?

17:42.262 --> 17:43.930
I traded with your Maw Maw.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.132
(gasps)

17:45.198 --> 17:46.633
Whoa!
* Something I need *

17:46.699 --> 17:48.401
(horn honks)
* Well, I got a brand-new *

17:48.468 --> 17:49.769
* Pair of roller skates *

17:49.836 --> 17:51.971
* You got a brand-new key *
(Maw Maw laughing)

17:52.038 --> 17:53.540
(gasps)

17:53.606 --> 17:56.075
* I got a brand-new
pair of roller skates *

17:56.143 --> 17:58.245
* You got a brand-new key. *

18:03.883 --> 18:05.352
She couldn't have
gotten far, right?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.653
What are the odds
she could wear
your skates?

18:06.719 --> 18:09.322
I don't know.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.791
I have pretty
small feet.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.526
What the hell is that?

18:20.700 --> 18:23.836
Your great-Maw Maw hit me on
the head with this boom box

18:23.903 --> 18:24.904
and stole our bike!

18:24.971 --> 18:26.939
I miss my daddy.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.842
(yelling)

18:40.720 --> 18:41.888
Whoo!

18:41.954 --> 18:43.723
(chuckles) Thanks for putting
on the clothes I got ya.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.124
Looking good!

18:45.192 --> 18:46.926
Jelly up, cowboy.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.995
I'm afraid all that working
outdoors might have made

18:49.061 --> 18:51.998
your hands a little too scratchy
for my girly parts.

18:52.064 --> 18:54.934
Did you bring protection in case
you can't stop at second?

18:55.001 --> 18:56.135
Won't be a problem.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.370
You sure about that?

18:57.437 --> 19:00.373
You haven't seen me
get my groove on.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.677
* *

19:07.146 --> 19:08.581
(growls)

19:10.650 --> 19:12.385
Yeah.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.623
* Love is like candy
on a shelf *

19:16.689 --> 19:18.891
Whoo!

19:18.958 --> 19:22.695
* You want a taste?
Then help yourself *

19:22.762 --> 19:23.896
(chuckles)

19:23.963 --> 19:27.300
* The sweetest things
are there for you *

19:27.367 --> 19:29.969
* Help yourself, take a few *
Whoo!

19:30.036 --> 19:34.274
* That's what I want
you to do *

19:34.341 --> 19:39.446
* We're always told repeatedly *

19:39.512 --> 19:40.913
You like what you see?

19:40.980 --> 19:43.883
I took exotic dance classes
at my local church.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.719
Really? Before that,
you were worse than this?

19:46.786 --> 19:48.721
Okay, come on.
Let's get it on.

19:48.788 --> 19:52.058
* I'm telling you
this is what you should do *

19:52.124 --> 19:54.394
You really think this is right,
what you're doing here?

19:54.461 --> 19:57.063
Sure do. Come on. Kiss me,
squeeze me, do something.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.731
Doesn't it gross you out
being in Maw Maw's bed?

19:58.798 --> 20:00.300
What do you think she'd
have to say about this?

20:00.367 --> 20:01.634
I was always Maw Maw's favorite.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.136
If she could see me,
I think she'd be just fine.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.306
Go on.
Go on and get 'em.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.275
Come on.
(whimpers)

20:10.310 --> 20:13.012
Hey! Get your hands off him!

20:13.079 --> 20:15.282
He's a married man, you harlot!

20:15.348 --> 20:16.649
(screams)

20:18.418 --> 20:20.387
You can have it all, Virginia--

20:20.453 --> 20:23.923
the house, Burt and the ghost
of that crazy old woman!

20:23.990 --> 20:27.460
Hey, for the record,
I did get to second base!

20:27.527 --> 20:30.162
My hand was on the bag!

20:30.229 --> 20:32.599
The left one was
kinda like this,

20:32.665 --> 20:34.233
but the right one
was more like...

20:35.435 --> 20:37.169
That's disgusting.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.405
Hold on. I'm not done.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.676
Leave Delilah alone.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.413
I used to think she was spoiled
and evil,

20:46.479 --> 20:50.116
but now I think
she's just sad and lonely.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.451
She's been all
over the country,

20:51.518 --> 20:53.686
and she's never found
what we've got right here.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.058
Yeah, single people
are kinda pathetic.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.361
After a certain age,
you're sort of like, "Whoa,

21:01.428 --> 21:03.129
why doesn't anyone love you?"

21:03.195 --> 21:04.130
Am I that age?

21:04.196 --> 21:05.264
No!

21:05.332 --> 21:06.766
Creeping up on it.

21:06.833 --> 21:10.637
You'll find somebody
to call your own.

21:10.703 --> 21:11.471
I have faith.

21:11.538 --> 21:12.905
Good morning, Wilfred.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.809
Looks like you're back
to being Wilfred.

21:16.876 --> 21:17.910
Great.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.078
Well, at least you have

21:19.145 --> 21:20.012
somebody to call your own.

21:21.681 --> 21:22.882
(sighs)

21:22.949 --> 21:25.217
You think other families
have to do stuff like this,

21:25.284 --> 21:27.620
and they're just too embarrassed
to talk about it?

21:31.424 --> 21:32.925
Nope.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.897
BOY: Adios, amigos.
thanks for watching.
