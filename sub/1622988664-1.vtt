01:08.327 --> 01:09.561
Just a minute.

01:17.502 --> 01:19.271
Mr. Nichols?

01:19.338 --> 01:20.739
This is the place.

01:23.508 --> 01:25.244
What in Sam Hill is going on?

01:25.311 --> 01:26.412
We're here to help you move.

01:26.479 --> 01:28.347
Is the furniture going?

01:28.414 --> 01:30.282
No, just the boxes.

01:30.349 --> 01:32.650
Wait, I didn't hire movers.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.519
Someone tweeted that
you needed help moving.

01:34.586 --> 01:35.955
I don't Twitter.

01:36.022 --> 01:40.658
[? yeah. ?] Be
careful with that.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.171
Hey, are these yours?

01:52.238 --> 01:53.738
They were my wife's.

01:53.805 --> 01:57.076
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:57.143 --> 01:59.145
Put them in back.

02:01.113 --> 02:03.449
You sure you don't
need help unloading?

02:03.516 --> 02:05.384
I can handle it.

02:05.451 --> 02:06.218
God loves you, man.

06:51.136 --> 06:53.305
God, I need a miracle.

07:45.624 --> 07:46.525
Hold your horses.

07:55.667 --> 07:56.435
Hey, bro.

07:56.502 --> 07:57.870
Ay.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.171
Call me sir.

07:59.238 --> 08:03.742
Right, sir.

08:03.809 --> 08:05.110
I left a shoe box inside.

08:05.177 --> 08:06.278
In my place?

08:06.345 --> 08:08.781
It's my grandmother's place.

08:08.847 --> 08:10.115
I stayed here until it rented.

08:19.591 --> 08:21.093
Take this too.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.494
Oh, you can keep that stuff.

08:22.561 --> 08:23.328
I don't want it.

08:23.395 --> 08:25.397
It's not going to fit in my car.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.766
Because it's a little baby car.

08:27.833 --> 08:29.234
Oh, hey, jarhead.

08:29.301 --> 08:32.471
I was hoping I'd never get
to see you again, homie.

08:32.538 --> 08:34.539
Likewise.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.280
I got something you're
going to need for him.

08:47.319 --> 08:50.222
Grandma Rose, she called
this her blessing stick.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.127
Blessing stick?

08:55.194 --> 08:56.795
Yeah, she the blessed people
over the head who were

08:56.862 --> 08:58.063
trying to get in her house.

09:00.766 --> 09:03.101
Hey, take your box.

09:05.804 --> 09:07.439
Merry Christmas, homie.

09:10.776 --> 09:11.577
It's not Christmas.

10:05.864 --> 10:08.066
That figures.

10:29.956 --> 10:31.456
Any time, Jesus.

10:31.523 --> 10:32.558
Any time.

10:32.624 --> 10:36.029
Hey, this guy's
stealing your truck.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.297
What?

10:42.834 --> 10:44.136
What's going on?

10:44.202 --> 10:45.137
Eddie Nichols?

10:45.203 --> 10:47.272
Get out of my truck.

10:47.339 --> 10:49.107
It's not your
truck anymore, man.

10:51.677 --> 10:53.912
The medical bills shouldn't
be tied to the truck.

10:53.980 --> 10:54.713
Can't we just...

10:54.780 --> 10:55.814
Eh.

10:55.881 --> 10:57.849
You have to talk
to the bank, OK?

11:18.303 --> 11:21.206
That sucks.

11:21.273 --> 11:26.311
In my home, young lady,
that was a swear word.

11:26.378 --> 11:29.381
Merry Christmas
to you too, Scrooge.

11:29.448 --> 11:33.619
It's not Christmas!

11:52.638 --> 11:53.839
Here we go again.

11:53.905 --> 11:55.240
[inaudible]

11:55.307 --> 11:56.274
It's my fault again.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.743
The night shift, the day shift...

11:57.809 --> 11:58.577
Yeah, OK.

11:58.644 --> 11:59.244
...the late shift.

11:59.311 --> 12:00.245
Oh, yeah.

12:00.312 --> 12:01.647
But I didn't do anything before.

12:01.713 --> 12:03.382
No, no, yeah, that's
what I've done my...

12:03.448 --> 12:05.417
...six hours, and there's
dishes [inaudible]..

12:05.484 --> 12:06.785
What, is there a camera here?

12:06.852 --> 12:07.919
Do you even see what I'm...

12:07.987 --> 12:08.955
[inaudible] the dishes.

12:09.022 --> 12:10.123
It doesn't make...

12:23.201 --> 12:24.403
Yeah?

12:24.469 --> 12:27.439
Just seeing if
everything is all right.

12:27.506 --> 12:28.840
He won't do the dishes.

12:35.681 --> 12:36.915
It's never about the dishes.

12:39.484 --> 12:40.585
Get away from the door.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.441
What are you looking at?

14:33.565 --> 14:34.967
Your Jesus is missing.

14:38.804 --> 14:39.939
Excuse me?

14:40.006 --> 14:42.275
Your Jesus is gone.

14:42.340 --> 14:45.144
You can say that again.

14:45.211 --> 14:46.545
Your Jesus is gone.

15:04.663 --> 15:06.098
I was just wondering
if I could...

15:06.165 --> 15:07.632
No.

15:07.699 --> 15:10.002
You don't know what
I was going to ask.

15:10.069 --> 15:11.570
Uh, no.

15:11.636 --> 15:13.206
Is that your final answer?

15:13.272 --> 15:15.473
No.

15:17.043 --> 15:19.444
Who's in charge here?

15:19.511 --> 15:20.512
I see his name.

15:20.579 --> 15:22.781
What's your name?

15:25.517 --> 15:28.120
My name is No.

15:44.436 --> 15:45.972
You don't... you're not perfect.

15:46.038 --> 15:47.505
You don't do everything.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.875
...and then you come home,
and there's piles of laundry

15:49.942 --> 15:50.442
everywhere.

15:50.508 --> 15:51.676
OK, one day.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.112
What about last week?

15:53.179 --> 15:54.146
What did I do...

15:54.213 --> 15:55.314
OK, just talk over me them.

15:55.380 --> 15:56.548
Yeah, fine, talk over me.

15:56.615 --> 15:57.916
What did I do last week?

16:00.652 --> 16:02.387
Do I even get a
"thank you," maybe?

16:02.454 --> 16:06.092
[inaudible] every
single day [inaudible]..

16:12.365 --> 16:14.900
Whatever!

16:33.518 --> 16:37.156
Your parents know where you are?

16:37.223 --> 16:39.591
Ramos is not my father.

16:39.658 --> 16:42.094
Does he hurt you?

16:42.161 --> 16:44.496
No, I'm a ghost to him.

16:50.435 --> 16:51.803
You're not a ghost.

16:51.870 --> 16:56.108
You are if nobody sees you.

16:56.175 --> 16:58.177
I see you.

17:03.416 --> 17:06.718
I knight thee a real, live kid.

17:09.321 --> 17:11.424
What is that?

17:11.489 --> 17:13.025
It's a blessing stick.

17:13.092 --> 17:15.294
I was going to give
Ramos a blessing.

17:15.361 --> 17:16.694
He doesn't deserve a blessing.

17:19.798 --> 17:22.300
Sometimes hurt
people hurt people.

17:22.367 --> 17:23.667
Who said that?

17:23.734 --> 17:25.470
I saw it on a bumper sticker.

17:31.277 --> 17:34.380
Rose used to light these up.

17:34.447 --> 17:36.614
They don't work anymore.

17:42.021 --> 17:44.889
I wish everyday was Christmas.

17:44.957 --> 17:46.225
Why is that?

17:46.292 --> 17:51.364
Christmas is about getting
presents, and people are nicer.

17:51.430 --> 17:53.466
Hope, get in here!

17:53.531 --> 17:55.468
Can I tell you something?

17:55.533 --> 17:56.801
Sure.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.204
That stuff you're in
smells really bad.

18:05.077 --> 18:07.079
No.

18:08.481 --> 18:10.950
Just this little
spot, for a garden.

18:11.017 --> 18:13.019
No.

18:23.062 --> 18:25.264
Go plant the garden
in the field out back.

18:29.268 --> 18:31.404
That land is toxic.

18:31.470 --> 18:33.039
Nothing will ever grow there.

18:33.105 --> 18:34.974
I'm going to take
that as a "yes."

24:19.051 --> 24:20.018
What's this place?

24:20.085 --> 24:22.254
It's where you hold your horses.

24:27.393 --> 24:30.963
Does your mother
know where you are?

24:31.029 --> 24:32.464
She's old school.

24:32.531 --> 24:33.499
She just says go play.

24:45.043 --> 24:47.012
What are you doing?

24:47.079 --> 24:49.248
Planting a garden.

24:52.851 --> 24:53.786
Why?

24:53.852 --> 24:54.753
Something to do.

24:54.820 --> 24:56.388
Looks like work.

24:56.455 --> 24:59.591
People not willing to
work, shouldn't eat.

24:59.658 --> 25:01.026
Says who?

25:01.093 --> 25:02.394
The Bible says that.

25:08.133 --> 25:09.835
Want to see something weird?

25:09.902 --> 25:12.104
Always.

25:25.617 --> 25:28.787
Of all the places in
this field, the best soil

25:28.854 --> 25:31.323
is under this dead tree.

25:31.390 --> 25:34.326
Nothing that's died has
ever come back to life.

25:36.862 --> 25:39.064
That's not true.

25:40.632 --> 25:43.035
My daddy died, and
he's never coming back.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.422
I'm sorry.

26:04.756 --> 26:06.291
Mom says people
shouldn't say sorry when

26:06.358 --> 26:08.160
you find out someone's died.

26:08.227 --> 26:10.095
You should ask what
were they like.

26:17.402 --> 26:19.304
OK.

26:19.371 --> 26:22.074
What was he like, your dad?

26:22.140 --> 26:24.810
He was good.

26:24.877 --> 26:27.446
Kind of silly.

26:27.513 --> 26:29.548
What was she like, your wife?

26:39.959 --> 26:42.528
How do you know I lost my wife?

26:42.594 --> 26:45.130
No one moves into
my neighborhood

26:45.197 --> 26:46.598
because they just
started living.

26:49.969 --> 26:53.171
She was kind of silly,
probably like your dad.

26:53.238 --> 26:55.040
She liked rock and
roll and sushi.

26:55.107 --> 26:55.975
Gross!

26:56.041 --> 27:00.112
Come on, kid.

27:00.178 --> 27:01.847
Give me a hand.

27:01.914 --> 27:03.215
What was your wife's name?

27:05.851 --> 27:08.287
Olivia, and she loved to work.

27:08.353 --> 27:11.223
Did she work at a donut shop?

27:11.290 --> 27:13.125
She was a horticulturist.

27:13.191 --> 27:15.995
A horti-whatter-what?

27:16.061 --> 27:17.362
She was a plant expert.

27:17.429 --> 27:20.033
She taught me everything
I know about gardening.

27:20.098 --> 27:21.166
What did you teach her?

27:24.703 --> 27:28.007
I taught her what I
thought I knew about faith.

27:28.073 --> 27:29.408
You a preacher?

27:29.474 --> 27:33.679
No, just a guy who's
read the Bible a lot.

27:33.745 --> 27:35.247
My mom has a Bible.

27:35.314 --> 27:37.382
She stopped reading
it after my dad died.

27:40.586 --> 27:41.988
Bible's got great stories in it.

27:42.055 --> 27:44.222
Comics.

27:44.289 --> 27:46.191
Great stories.

27:46.258 --> 27:47.392
They're not true stories.

27:50.029 --> 27:52.698
I used to tell Bible stories
while working in our garden.

27:55.300 --> 27:59.838
Say, what's your name?

27:59.905 --> 28:01.074
Hope.

28:01.139 --> 28:02.708
What's yours?

28:02.774 --> 28:07.679
When I was a school teacher,
they called me Mr. Nichols.

28:07.746 --> 28:12.085
Are you gonna tell Bible stories
while you plant this garden?

28:12.150 --> 28:14.386
No.

28:14.453 --> 28:16.188
There is no one left
to tell them to.

28:31.436 --> 28:34.606
This old
man, he played one.

28:34.673 --> 28:37.442
He played knick
knack on my thumb.

28:37.509 --> 28:41.213
With a knick knack paddy
whack, give a dog a bone,

28:41.279 --> 28:45.817
this old man came rolling home.

29:52.384 --> 29:55.620
That was the longest
20 yards of my life.

29:57.422 --> 29:59.391
My sciatica is killing me.

30:05.363 --> 30:07.200
I don't even remember
how I got here.

31:04.856 --> 31:06.225
What did you find?

31:06.291 --> 31:09.294
Looks like a plug.

31:09.361 --> 31:10.762
It's a tree nut.

31:10.829 --> 31:13.065
Some part of the tree
once grew out of there.

31:17.970 --> 31:19.538
Trees are the first
thing that God

31:19.604 --> 31:21.339
planted in the Garden of Eden.

31:21.406 --> 31:23.375
Eden?

31:24.476 --> 31:26.511
It's the first
story in the Bible.

31:33.819 --> 31:35.854
In the beginning,
there was nothing.

31:35.921 --> 31:36.321
Nothing?

31:36.388 --> 31:37.689
Nothing.

31:37.756 --> 31:42.794
No earth, no sky, no
sea, plants, no animals,

31:42.861 --> 31:43.495
and no people.

31:43.562 --> 31:45.131
I didn't know that.

31:45.198 --> 31:48.800
God spoke in the darkness,
"Let there be light."

31:48.867 --> 31:50.937
And just like that,
there was light.

31:51.003 --> 31:52.404
Like a light switch.

31:52.470 --> 31:56.309
Like a light switch God
saw the light was good,

31:56.374 --> 31:59.878
so He split the light from
the dark and called it a day.

31:59.946 --> 32:01.847
The next morning,
God looked around

32:01.913 --> 32:05.251
and thought the Earth
needs to be more organized.

32:05.318 --> 32:09.387
So He put all the water in
one place and all the dry land

32:09.454 --> 32:10.822
in another.

32:10.889 --> 32:14.392
When He finished that,
He made plants and trees,

32:14.459 --> 32:16.295
like the ones that cover
the Rocky Mountains.

32:19.198 --> 32:21.399
Come on.

32:23.970 --> 32:26.738
All sorts of trees and
grasses began to grow.

32:29.275 --> 32:33.946
Then God made the sun to
light the sky during the day.

32:34.013 --> 32:37.449
He hung the moon and stars
to sparkle the night.

32:37.515 --> 32:39.151
He stepped back to
look at His work

32:39.218 --> 32:42.288
and said "This is good stuff."

32:42.355 --> 32:43.421
Good stuff.

32:46.058 --> 32:49.594
The next day, God filled
the waters with life...

32:49.661 --> 32:52.064
millions of fish
swimming in the ocean.

32:52.131 --> 32:55.268
He made birds and sent them
soaring through the air.

32:55.334 --> 32:56.235
"Excellent.

32:56.302 --> 33:00.805
This is good," He said.

33:00.872 --> 33:01.740
Come on.

33:04.876 --> 33:07.679
Then God let the
Earth bring forth

33:07.746 --> 33:10.515
living creatures,
creeping things,

33:10.582 --> 33:12.084
and beasts of the Earth.

33:12.151 --> 33:14.053
Dinosaurs?

33:14.120 --> 33:19.392
Everything, from ants to zebras,
lions and tigers and bears.

33:19.457 --> 33:20.192
Oh boy.

33:23.495 --> 33:26.332
But God felt
something was missing.

33:26.399 --> 33:27.699
What was missing?

33:27.766 --> 33:28.367
Man.

33:28.433 --> 33:29.534
What about woman?

33:34.906 --> 33:36.409
God spoke again.

33:36.474 --> 33:40.745
"Let Us make man in Our
image, and let him rule over

33:40.812 --> 33:43.448
the fish in the sea,
the birds in the air,

33:43.515 --> 33:45.650
and the creatures on land."

33:45.717 --> 33:48.620
And it happened just like that.

33:51.257 --> 33:54.459
He created the very first man.

33:54.526 --> 33:56.728
From what?

33:58.197 --> 34:03.436
Life will grow from the soil
of the Earth if it is loved.

34:03.501 --> 34:05.137
God made man from dirt.

34:08.806 --> 34:11.344
What did God make kids from?

34:11.409 --> 34:12.476
Candy, of course.

34:15.580 --> 34:17.183
Do you have kids?

34:17.248 --> 34:18.284
I have a daughter.

34:18.351 --> 34:20.518
She's all grown up and married.

34:20.585 --> 34:22.121
She's mad at me.

34:22.188 --> 34:23.855
How come?

34:23.922 --> 34:27.525
She doesn't like the choices
I made for her mom at the end.

34:27.592 --> 34:30.695
Well, just go tell
her you're sorry.

34:37.469 --> 34:39.536
It's not that easy.

34:39.603 --> 34:44.377
When I get in trouble, my
mom sends me to my room.

34:44.443 --> 34:48.014
But when I go say I'm
sorry, she lets me out.

34:52.650 --> 34:55.087
Wait.

34:55.154 --> 34:57.756
I bet my mom's looking
for me right now.

35:03.362 --> 35:05.431
What about woman?

35:05.498 --> 35:07.699
Tomorrow.

35:15.707 --> 35:17.143
Hope, where are you?

35:21.613 --> 35:22.481
Excuse me.

35:22.547 --> 35:25.518
Have you seen my kid?

35:28.887 --> 35:30.622
I'll take that as a no.

35:37.296 --> 35:38.130
Careful.

35:38.197 --> 35:39.265
You'll blow yourself up.

35:48.307 --> 35:49.574
OK.

35:49.641 --> 35:50.509
OK.

35:50.575 --> 35:51.776
That was fun, Shawna.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.354
I win.

36:02.421 --> 36:03.721
I dare you.

36:03.788 --> 36:04.889
I dare you.

36:53.973 --> 36:58.511
Hey, I think we got
off on the wrong foot.

36:58.577 --> 37:00.879
Is that supposed to be
some kind of lame joke?

37:04.517 --> 37:05.817
No, not at all.

37:12.158 --> 37:13.892
IED?

37:13.959 --> 37:15.860
It wasn't an IOU the
government gave me.

37:18.397 --> 37:19.632
All right, then.

37:19.697 --> 37:21.900
Oorah.

37:24.203 --> 37:25.870
Marines?

37:25.938 --> 37:28.607
Vietnam, '68 to '71.

37:28.673 --> 37:29.608
Infantry?

37:29.674 --> 37:30.509
Chaplain.

38:02.474 --> 38:06.045
You're not some kind
of weirdo, are you?

38:06.111 --> 38:08.147
I'm a retired grade
school teacher.

38:11.584 --> 38:13.485
What's with the garden?

38:13.552 --> 38:15.054
It's a healing garden.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.922
My wife planted one
while she was sick.

38:17.990 --> 38:20.092
It didn't work.

38:20.159 --> 38:22.328
I'm sorry.

38:22.394 --> 38:24.663
Well, not sure I want you
filling my kid's head wtih

38:24.729 --> 38:26.432
stories about men
being made from dirt,

38:26.498 --> 38:28.866
because that's the only
thing the Bible got right.

38:31.903 --> 38:34.073
War is a dirty thing.

38:34.139 --> 38:36.342
A man can't wash
it off on his own.

38:48.454 --> 38:50.422
[ON RADIO] Well, Jim, you
know what they say here

38:50.489 --> 38:52.924
in Colorado... if you
don't like the weather,

38:52.992 --> 38:54.326
just wait 10 minutes.

38:54.393 --> 38:56.195
But I wouldn't hold
you up on that,

38:56.262 --> 39:00.065
because summer is holding strong
across the Denver metro area.

39:00.132 --> 39:03.135
In fact, Commerce City tied the
record high afternoon Thursday

39:03.202 --> 39:08.540
of 96 degrees,
first set in 1990.

39:20.152 --> 39:22.688
Is God making girls today?

39:22.755 --> 39:24.822
He makes a woman
for the lonely man.

39:27.593 --> 39:29.794
Cookies for breakfast?

39:29.861 --> 39:31.697
At this point, why not?

39:46.811 --> 39:48.614
Didn't we pull those already?

39:48.681 --> 39:49.448
I got 'em.

39:57.589 --> 40:00.926
God placed the man He had
made in a perfect garden

40:00.993 --> 40:03.962
and told him to take care of it.

40:04.029 --> 40:05.397
No one took care of this tree.

40:12.471 --> 40:15.207
Only the spirit of God could
bring this tree to life.

40:20.446 --> 40:23.816
I think I left my
spirit at home.

40:23.881 --> 40:27.353
Your body's barely here, Norm.

40:29.388 --> 40:34.293
In the middle of the garden,
God planted two special trees.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.795
One was called the tree
of life, and the other

40:36.861 --> 40:40.232
was called the tree of
knowledge of good and evil.

40:40.299 --> 40:42.134
That sounds like a scary movie.

40:42.201 --> 40:45.437
Evil can feel like
a scary movie.

40:45.504 --> 40:46.638
So God told Adam...

40:46.705 --> 40:49.007
that was the man's name...

40:49.074 --> 40:52.444
he could eat the fruit from
every tree in the garden

40:52.511 --> 40:56.849
except from the tree of
knowledge of good and evil.

40:56.914 --> 41:00.885
"If you eat from this tree,"
God said, "you will die."

41:00.953 --> 41:03.322
Why would God grow a
tree you can't eat from?

41:03.389 --> 41:05.524
He wanted people
to have a choice.

41:05.591 --> 41:08.761
Without free will, we would
just be under God's control.

41:08.827 --> 41:11.497
Like a robot.

41:11.563 --> 41:13.432
Yeah, like a robot.

41:17.970 --> 41:20.372
What's that fool doing now?

41:20.439 --> 41:21.640
OK.

41:21.707 --> 41:22.841
Ready to hear about the woman?

41:22.907 --> 41:26.445
I've been waiting forever.

41:26.512 --> 41:29.948
Adam was lonely and
needed a helper.

41:30.015 --> 41:33.385
So God made Adam fall
into a deep sleep,

41:33.452 --> 41:38.123
took a rib from him, and made
the very first woman from it.

41:38.190 --> 41:41.260
My mom is made of way
more than just a rib.

41:41.326 --> 41:44.329
Women were made as a source
of strength and reinforcement.

41:44.396 --> 41:47.299
All women are more
than just a rib.

41:47.366 --> 41:51.303
The man Adam named his wife
Eve because she would become

41:51.370 --> 41:54.573
the mother of all that live.

41:54.640 --> 42:02.080
But one day Eve was
walking in the garden,

42:02.147 --> 42:04.116
and a snake spoke to her.

42:04.183 --> 42:05.884
A talking snake?

42:05.951 --> 42:07.820
That's just weird.

42:07.886 --> 42:13.292
If it's weird and in the
Bible, it's probably important.

42:13.358 --> 42:15.794
So the snake says
"Did God really

42:15.861 --> 42:19.698
say you can't eat the fruit
from the tree of knowledge

42:19.765 --> 42:20.833
of good and evil?"

42:20.899 --> 42:22.568
What did she say?

42:22.634 --> 42:27.005
She said "We can eat from
any tree in the garden,

42:27.072 --> 42:28.073
but not that one.

42:28.140 --> 42:31.109
God said if we do, we'll die."

42:31.176 --> 42:33.879
Get back, you snake!

42:33.947 --> 42:38.484
So the snake says
"You won't die.

42:38.550 --> 42:42.888
God knows that if you eat
the fruit from that tree

42:42.956 --> 42:50.095
you will become wise as a
god, knowing good and evil."

42:50.162 --> 42:51.697
What do you think Eve did?

42:51.763 --> 42:54.700
She ate from the tree.

42:54.766 --> 42:56.235
Why do you think she did that?

42:56.301 --> 42:57.870
Because you just can't help it.

42:57.937 --> 42:59.605
That's right.

42:59.671 --> 43:02.774
She ate the fruit and then
handed it to her husband Adam.

43:02.841 --> 43:04.209
He was there?

43:04.276 --> 43:06.278
He was standing right
there, doing nothing.

43:06.345 --> 43:08.046
He ate the fruit too.

43:08.113 --> 43:12.184
Then they both saw for the first
time that they had no clothes.

43:12.251 --> 43:13.987
They must have freaked out.

43:14.052 --> 43:14.954
They did.

43:15.020 --> 43:16.421
They felt ashamed.

43:16.488 --> 43:19.625
They ran off and picked
leaves from a fig tree

43:19.691 --> 43:21.193
to cover themselves.

43:21.260 --> 43:23.729
And that was the first sin.

43:23.795 --> 43:27.766
From then on, life
became very hard.

43:34.239 --> 43:36.108
Eve totally blew it.

43:36.174 --> 43:39.511
No, they both blew it.

43:39.578 --> 43:41.813
They should have both been
looking after each other.

43:59.731 --> 44:00.934
Stay here.

44:14.413 --> 44:16.548
What are you doing?

44:16.615 --> 44:17.951
What does it look like, chappie?

44:18.017 --> 44:20.218
Call me sir.

44:21.553 --> 44:24.156
I'll put it in the
corner over there.

44:24.222 --> 44:26.158
No, we're planting
a garden here.

44:28.493 --> 44:31.163
What kind of garden do you think
you're gonna grow in this dump?

44:31.229 --> 44:33.465
The kind I grew in Vietnam.

44:33.532 --> 44:35.068
Oh, I don't like vegetables.

44:35.133 --> 44:37.235
It was a flower garden.

44:37.302 --> 44:38.537
I don't like flowers.

44:38.604 --> 44:41.206
Take your garbage
out of this field.

44:54.219 --> 44:55.921
Are you crazy, old man?

44:55.989 --> 44:58.490
Give me my leg back!

44:58.557 --> 45:02.728
This is better than
fake news on TV.

45:02.794 --> 45:03.562
Yeah.

45:03.629 --> 45:05.464
I just had an IV just yesterday.

45:09.468 --> 45:10.869
You don't know what
I've been through!

45:10.937 --> 45:14.506
I know exactly what
you've been through.

45:14.573 --> 45:19.611
Those flowers were to lay on
the body bags of dead Marines.

45:19.678 --> 45:20.612
Dead Marines!

45:58.550 --> 45:59.651
Have a good day, Marine.

46:09.294 --> 46:10.930
That was awesome.

46:10.997 --> 46:11.897
Yeah?

46:11.964 --> 46:13.365
Well, he had it coming.

46:13.432 --> 46:15.068
What's the next story?

46:15.134 --> 46:20.139
Tomorrow I'll tell you how God
wiped out humanity with water.

47:31.177 --> 47:34.147
Hey, let me ask you something.

47:34.213 --> 47:35.881
No.

47:35.948 --> 47:37.482
Come on!

47:37.549 --> 47:40.418
Everybody here has an
ache, a pain, or a problem.

47:40.485 --> 47:41.753
They all bring them to me.

47:45.423 --> 47:46.358
Listen.

47:46.424 --> 47:48.194
I heard you're a chaplain.

47:48.261 --> 47:50.963
I was.

47:51.030 --> 47:53.832
I'm not getting
any younger, and I

47:53.899 --> 47:58.804
want to make sure I'm right
with the Big Guy upstairs.

47:58.870 --> 48:00.039
The Big Guy?

48:00.106 --> 48:00.839
Yeah.

48:00.906 --> 48:02.074
You know, God.

48:02.141 --> 48:05.011
Jesus and the Spirit thing.

48:05.077 --> 48:07.679
Do you believe that God sent
His one and only Son to Earth

48:07.746 --> 48:10.582
to pay for your sins
and died on a cross

48:10.649 --> 48:13.052
and was resurrected
from the dead?

48:13.119 --> 48:14.020
Yeah, sure.

48:14.086 --> 48:15.353
OK. Fine.

48:15.420 --> 48:17.389
You're good.

48:17.455 --> 48:20.325
Oh, really?
Am I?

48:21.060 --> 48:22.727
Listen, uh...

48:22.794 --> 48:24.096
Carl.

48:24.163 --> 48:25.864
Listen, Carl.

48:25.932 --> 48:29.634
Only you and Christ know
what's in your heart.

48:29.701 --> 48:32.071
And if all that's
in your heart is no,

48:32.138 --> 48:34.573
you better find yes
before it's too late.

50:19.178 --> 50:21.813
Why did God wipe out people?

50:21.880 --> 50:25.617
Because they forgot about
Him and how He loved them.

50:25.684 --> 50:27.219
Except for one man.

50:27.286 --> 50:28.421
His name was Noah.

50:28.486 --> 50:30.122
Oh, I know this story.

50:30.189 --> 50:31.523
You do?

50:31.589 --> 50:33.359
I once got a Noah's
Ark toy for Christmas.

50:33.426 --> 50:35.127
That's why I love Christmas...

50:35.194 --> 50:36.295
you get presents.

50:36.362 --> 50:38.097
Christmas isn't about getting.

50:38.164 --> 50:38.965
Yes it is.

50:39.031 --> 50:40.799
No it's not.

50:40.865 --> 50:43.269
We'll have to skip to the
Christmas story after this one

50:43.336 --> 50:44.403
so you'll know the truth.

50:44.469 --> 50:46.205
You're the storyteller.

50:46.272 --> 50:50.209
So God was very sad that
people stopped loving Him

50:50.276 --> 50:53.511
and that they were
cruel to each other.

50:55.747 --> 50:56.681
Come on, kid.

50:56.748 --> 50:57.682
Let's get out of the heat.

51:16.534 --> 51:17.602
Thank you.

51:17.669 --> 51:19.871
Here you go.

51:26.544 --> 51:27.912
Have a seat.

51:43.029 --> 51:47.967
God said to Noah, "I'm going to
bring rain to flood the earth.

51:48.034 --> 51:51.470
Build a huge boat
from wood, an ark."

51:51.536 --> 51:54.140
Noah did exactly what God asked.

51:54.206 --> 51:57.376
He entered the boat with
his wife, their sons,

51:57.443 --> 51:59.178
and their wives.

51:59.245 --> 52:00.212
Then all the animals came.

52:03.215 --> 52:04.916
Except for the unicorns.

52:04.984 --> 52:06.918
There's no such
thing as unicorns.

52:06.986 --> 52:09.255
Because they didn't
make it to the Ark.

52:13.259 --> 52:14.460
I'm kidding.

52:14.527 --> 52:15.660
Unicorns aren't real.

52:18.130 --> 52:23.469
It rained and poured for
40 days and 40 nights,

52:23.536 --> 52:28.074
flooding the earth and washing
away all living things.

52:28.140 --> 52:30.909
After a long time,
the Ark finally

52:30.976 --> 52:34.013
rested on the side
of a mountain.

52:34.080 --> 52:37.882
Noah's family and all the
animals came off the boat

52:37.950 --> 52:41.753
and spread out all
over the world.

52:41.820 --> 52:44.490
I hope it never floods
like that ever again.

52:44.557 --> 52:45.623
It won't.

52:45.690 --> 52:47.560
How do you know that?

52:47.625 --> 52:50.529
The rainbow in the sky.

52:50.595 --> 52:54.133
It was God's promise to us that
He would never do that again.

52:55.101 --> 52:55.733
Yeah!

52:57.369 --> 52:59.572
That's a great story.

52:59.637 --> 53:01.240
Ohoh!

53:01.307 --> 53:03.309
It is.

53:09.215 --> 53:14.386
But Christmas is the
greatest story ever told.

53:14.453 --> 53:17.590
I'm ready.

53:17.655 --> 53:21.127
Tomorrow while we
plant seeds, I'll

53:21.193 --> 53:22.894
tell you the story
of the miracle.

53:26.031 --> 53:30.169
But first I've
got a job for you.

53:42.348 --> 53:43.449
No.

53:43.516 --> 53:44.782
Eddie told me you'd say that.

53:47.685 --> 53:48.387
Eddie he sent you?

53:48.454 --> 53:49.188
Yep.

53:53.526 --> 53:55.127
All right, kid.

53:55.194 --> 53:56.495
What do you need?

54:18.517 --> 54:21.786
You do know it's not Christmas.

54:21.853 --> 54:23.721
Maybe every day
should be Christmas.

54:23.788 --> 54:25.391
People would be
nicer to each other.

54:28.726 --> 54:29.929
Can I ask you something?

54:34.366 --> 54:40.406
The other day, what did you
mean it's not about the dishes?

54:44.842 --> 54:47.079
You live with a woman
who's had it rough.

54:47.146 --> 54:50.249
She has a child
that needs a father.

54:50.316 --> 54:53.185
If you want a peaceful home, you
need to be a spiritual warrior.

54:56.222 --> 54:59.959
Thought a lot about God
when I was over there.

55:00.025 --> 55:04.096
It seemed more real then.

55:04.163 --> 55:07.099
Death makes God real
for some people.

55:07.166 --> 55:11.136
For others, it can lead them
to questioning their faith.

55:15.474 --> 55:16.375
What was your wife like?

55:22.880 --> 55:24.183
She was awesome.

55:29.555 --> 55:31.290
Good day, chaplain.

55:32.658 --> 55:37.229
Hey, I was baptized
when I was a baby.

55:37.296 --> 55:41.300
Does that stick, or do
I need to do that again?

55:43.801 --> 55:44.703
Just do the dishes.

56:02.388 --> 56:03.589
Excuse me, sir.

56:03.656 --> 56:06.525
What's your problem?

56:06.592 --> 56:08.793
Go with it.

56:10.095 --> 56:18.404
My back hurts, I have to
go to the bathroom a lot,

56:18.470 --> 56:23.942
my nose hairs keep going,
and Hollywood's canceled

56:24.009 --> 56:28.080
the only comedy TV show
starring a conservative.

56:28.147 --> 56:36.021
I can live with all that, but
my spirit is just failing.

56:39.458 --> 56:41.460
Thank you.

56:41.527 --> 56:45.030
Thanks for
brightening up my day.

56:45.097 --> 56:47.299
You're welcome.

56:55.607 --> 56:58.477
Tell us your problem, and
we're going to try and fix it.

57:10.723 --> 57:12.725
Sir, what's your problem?

57:12.791 --> 57:14.093
What about my blood pressure?

57:17.996 --> 57:21.433
She wants to know what's wrong.

57:21.500 --> 57:23.502
I'm old.

57:40.619 --> 57:41.387
Flatulence.

57:44.889 --> 57:45.958
What are you two doing?

58:04.576 --> 58:06.578
Why are you sending my kid
around the neighborhood

58:06.645 --> 58:08.313
to bother people
about what aches them?

58:08.380 --> 58:11.049
These people don't want
to talk about their pain.

58:11.116 --> 58:11.916
I know.

58:11.984 --> 58:14.219
I see it every day.

58:14.286 --> 58:16.422
And stop with the
supernatural Bible stories

58:16.488 --> 58:18.157
that get her asking
questions about

58:18.223 --> 58:20.526
whether or not her father
can come back from the dead.

58:26.031 --> 58:27.399
Where do you think you're going?

58:27.466 --> 58:28.967
I'm going to go get dish soap.

58:33.972 --> 58:35.007
Mend your own family.

59:22.154 --> 59:23.489
All right.

59:23.555 --> 59:28.861
Cathy has had the
hiccups since 1984.

59:28.928 --> 59:30.262
I'm not so sure I believe that.

59:34.233 --> 59:35.467
Grumpy's back...

59:35.534 --> 59:36.936
Mhm.

59:37.002 --> 59:40.672
...his nose hair, and Hollywood
canceled his favorite comedy

59:40.739 --> 59:41.540
show.

59:41.607 --> 59:42.875
Yep.

59:42.942 --> 59:44.610
And Stanley can't hear.

59:44.676 --> 59:46.678
Mhm.

59:49.615 --> 59:51.750
Are you going to tell me
what this was all about?

59:54.520 --> 59:59.091
Gonna plant a seed in the garden
for everyone and pray for them.

59:59.157 --> 01:00:00.526
Well, I want to be on the list.

01:00:00.592 --> 01:00:01.293
My knees hurt.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:01.827
OK.

01:00:01.894 --> 01:00:04.096
Go for it.

01:00:09.768 --> 01:00:11.770
Where's he going?

01:00:14.706 --> 01:00:18.577
Lord, bless this
soil and this seed

01:00:18.644 --> 01:00:21.948
I offer to You in the name
of my daughter Jeannie.

01:00:22.015 --> 01:00:24.449
Heal her heart.

01:00:24.516 --> 01:00:26.418
She's my favorite
person in the world.

01:00:32.891 --> 01:00:34.159
In the name of Christ, Amen.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.202
You should have a helmet on.

01:01:17.269 --> 01:01:18.470
You sound like your mother.

01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:26.278
How you doing, honey?

01:01:29.247 --> 01:01:32.217
OK, I guess.

01:01:32.284 --> 01:01:34.853
Teaching kids keeps me busy.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.755
But you know that.

01:01:36.822 --> 01:01:39.491
Kids can fill up a lot
of space in one's mind.

01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:44.630
What's with the bike?

01:01:50.168 --> 01:01:51.303
The bank took my truck.

01:01:55.741 --> 01:01:58.844
You'd still have your
truck if you'd let mom stay

01:01:58.910 --> 01:02:02.015
in the hospital longer.

01:02:02.081 --> 01:02:04.017
That's not what she wanted.

01:02:04.083 --> 01:02:06.218
She was sick, Dad.

01:02:06.284 --> 01:02:07.586
She wasn't thinking right.

01:02:07.653 --> 01:02:10.389
She had cancer,
Jeannie, not dementia.

01:02:10.455 --> 01:02:12.924
She didn't want to
die in a hospital.

01:02:12.992 --> 01:02:17.329
She died as she wanted, sitting
in that old chair looking out

01:02:17.396 --> 01:02:18.597
over her garden.

01:02:18.664 --> 01:02:20.332
She could have lived longer.

01:02:20.399 --> 01:02:23.970
Longer? For who?
For us?

01:02:24.037 --> 01:02:26.939
It's our job to let
them go as they wish.

01:02:27.006 --> 01:02:29.541
Oh, is that what you've done?

01:02:29.608 --> 01:02:31.677
Or is she still sitting
on a shelf somewhere?

01:02:31.743 --> 01:02:33.745
I'm working on it.

01:02:40.352 --> 01:02:41.920
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:02:41.988 --> 01:02:42.721
It's just...

01:02:42.788 --> 01:02:48.027
No, I'm sorry.

01:02:48.094 --> 01:02:49.528
I could have been
a better father.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.268
You're a good dad.

01:03:03.943 --> 01:03:05.477
I just hurt so bad.

01:03:13.418 --> 01:03:15.988
You have to know
Mom is with Jesus.

01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:21.626
I just don't see God working
in my life right now.

01:03:25.564 --> 01:03:29.135
It's time to let go.

01:03:29.202 --> 01:03:32.038
That may take a miracle.

01:03:32.105 --> 01:03:33.672
Maybe the miracle happens after.

01:03:40.579 --> 01:03:42.414
You're not riding
home without a helmet.

01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:51.124
So that's your garden, huh?

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:58.998
It's just dirt right
now. How's Alan?

01:03:59.065 --> 01:04:00.699
He's good.

01:04:00.766 --> 01:04:03.435
Working hard.

01:04:03.502 --> 01:04:05.704
He likes you.

01:04:07.506 --> 01:04:10.375
That's a start.

01:04:10.442 --> 01:04:13.478
I like you, most of the time.

01:04:21.853 --> 01:04:26.993
I'm going to post a picture of
your garden to the internet.

01:04:27.059 --> 01:04:30.762
The internet is witchcraft.

01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:34.399
The internet is whatever
you point it at.

01:04:34.466 --> 01:04:38.770
I always point it
at something good...

01:04:38.837 --> 01:04:41.406
like getting young Christians
to help an old man move.

01:04:50.149 --> 01:04:51.449
See you around, Dad.

01:05:34.359 --> 01:05:35.861
Oh hey, Santa.

01:05:43.269 --> 01:05:45.304
Question.

01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:47.572
Sure.

01:05:57.582 --> 01:06:00.819
Yeah, I can do that.

01:06:00.886 --> 01:06:02.888
Thanks, Chaplain.

01:06:06.092 --> 01:06:07.392
Oh, look at it now.

01:06:34.586 --> 01:06:36.788
You ready?

01:06:36.855 --> 01:06:38.857
Are you?

01:07:02.348 --> 01:07:04.549
Now I am.

01:08:16.988 --> 01:08:23.627
I baptize you in the name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

01:08:23.694 --> 01:08:26.663
Buried in the
likeness of His death

01:08:26.731 --> 01:08:30.667
and raised in the likeness
of His Resurrection

01:08:30.734 --> 01:08:31.937
to be a new man.

01:10:05.231 --> 01:10:07.266
I brought the people
for the Christmas story.

01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:08.334
Did you bring the list?

01:10:14.273 --> 01:10:15.640
Stanley's hearing is bad.

01:10:27.886 --> 01:10:31.023
Cathy has the hiccups.

01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:31.590
Wow.

01:10:31.656 --> 01:10:34.859
Since 1984.

01:10:34.927 --> 01:10:36.428
Why are we doing this?

01:10:36.495 --> 01:10:38.964
And what's this got to do
with the Christmas story?

01:10:39.031 --> 01:10:41.733
We're doing this to
plant the Word of God

01:10:41.799 --> 01:10:43.536
in people who need it.

01:10:43.602 --> 01:10:45.037
The Word?

01:10:45.104 --> 01:10:48.407
The Word was with God
and the Word was God.

01:10:53.312 --> 01:10:54.180
Just follow along.

01:10:58.050 --> 01:11:01.786
A long time ago,
God planted the Word

01:11:01.853 --> 01:11:04.023
in a young woman named Mary.

01:11:04.089 --> 01:11:07.892
She had a man that then
married her named Joseph.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:11.729
She told him that an
angel came to visit her

01:11:11.796 --> 01:11:14.832
and said she would give
birth to the Son of God.

01:11:14.899 --> 01:11:17.036
It was hard for him
to believe at first,

01:11:17.102 --> 01:11:20.172
until an angel came to
him and told him so.

01:11:20.239 --> 01:11:24.876
So Joseph committed himself
to Mary as her husband.

01:11:24.944 --> 01:11:26.811
Norm's spirit is failing.

01:11:26.878 --> 01:11:29.148
Oh, he can't have that.

01:11:33.953 --> 01:11:38.657
So when it came time
for Mary to give birth,

01:11:38.723 --> 01:11:40.993
it happened to fall
at the same time

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.528
that the government
wanted people

01:11:42.595 --> 01:11:44.597
to be counted by
where they lived.

01:11:44.663 --> 01:11:48.634
Mary and Joseph had to travel
to Bethlehem to be counted.

01:11:48.701 --> 01:11:51.270
It was a long hard trip.

01:11:51.337 --> 01:11:54.306
And when they reached the
town, all the hotels were full.

01:11:54.373 --> 01:11:56.709
There was nowhere
for them to stay.

01:11:56.774 --> 01:11:58.577
Why didn't someone help them?

01:11:58.644 --> 01:12:00.079
Well, someone finally did.

01:12:00.145 --> 01:12:02.615
Some people felt bad for
them and offered them a barn

01:12:02.681 --> 01:12:03.881
to stay in.

01:12:03.949 --> 01:12:05.917
The Son of God was
born in a barn?

01:12:05.985 --> 01:12:08.053
Yep.

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.723
But Mary and Joseph
were very thankful

01:12:10.788 --> 01:12:12.157
that they had a place to stay.

01:12:17.795 --> 01:12:18.931
It's for my mom.

01:12:22.968 --> 01:12:24.503
You are a good person.

01:12:28.274 --> 01:12:32.910
That night, shepherds visited
the baby, and later a star

01:12:32.978 --> 01:12:35.681
guided three wise men from
the East to see the baby

01:12:35.748 --> 01:12:41.353
Jesus, the King of kings, the
One who would save the world.

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:43.455
Why did the world
need to be saved?

01:12:43.522 --> 01:12:46.292
Because of the first sin, hello.

01:12:46.358 --> 01:12:51.196
The fruit that Eve ate with
Adam standing right there.

01:12:51.263 --> 01:12:53.831
Hello.

01:12:53.898 --> 01:12:55.601
Exactly.

01:12:55.668 --> 01:13:00.172
That baby would grow up to
be Jesus Christ, the greatest

01:13:00.239 --> 01:13:06.512
Teacher of love and the
Savior to the lost and broken.

01:13:06.578 --> 01:13:08.347
This is from Carl.

01:13:08.414 --> 01:13:10.282
He has a bad knee.

01:13:10.349 --> 01:13:13.918
Dear God, say yes
to Carl's knee.

01:13:16.921 --> 01:13:22.628
Some people rejected Jesus, so
they hung Him on a dead tree

01:13:22.695 --> 01:13:24.363
until He died.

01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:28.334
However, before He died,
He told His followers

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.503
He would rise three days later.

01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:33.205
And he did.

01:13:33.272 --> 01:13:36.508
He's the only man who's
ever beaten death.

01:13:36.575 --> 01:13:38.077
That's right.

01:13:38.143 --> 01:13:40.446
But he's a man that can
guide you through this life.

01:13:52.491 --> 01:13:54.293
Are you ever going to
tell me why Christmas

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.627
isn't about getting presents?

01:13:58.964 --> 01:14:01.866
The reason we give
gifts at Christmas

01:14:01.934 --> 01:14:04.203
comes from the story
of the wise men...

01:14:04.269 --> 01:14:04.803
Oh, good.

01:14:04.869 --> 01:14:06.205
Another story.

01:14:06.271 --> 01:14:09.241
...who traveled a
long hard journey

01:14:09.308 --> 01:14:13.178
in order to present Christ
with gifts to honor him.

01:14:13.245 --> 01:14:15.481
Giving gifts is
a symbol of love.

01:14:15.547 --> 01:14:19.551
During Christmas, it remind
us of the gift of Christ

01:14:19.618 --> 01:14:23.956
and our need to give that
gift of love to others.

01:14:24.022 --> 01:14:25.923
That's why Christmas
should be every day.

01:14:25.991 --> 01:14:27.559
Yes.

01:14:27.626 --> 01:14:32.998
People should behave like every
day is Christmas, including me.

01:14:44.977 --> 01:14:47.546
Baby Jesus is still missing.

01:14:47.613 --> 01:14:48.447
No, it's not.

01:14:52.718 --> 01:14:53.552
Merry Christmas.

01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:04.129
Merry Christmas to you!

01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:12.638
I wish we had power
to light it up.

01:15:16.675 --> 01:15:19.378
What now?

01:15:19.445 --> 01:15:21.046
We pray for the healing garden.

01:15:23.749 --> 01:15:25.951
Here.

01:15:33.592 --> 01:15:35.627
How do you pray?

01:15:35.694 --> 01:15:38.330
Jesus told us how to pray.

01:15:38.397 --> 01:15:39.665
Open it to the red tag.

01:15:49.675 --> 01:15:52.478
Read the part
highlighted in red.

01:15:52.544 --> 01:15:59.685
"Our Father, who art
in heaven, hallowed?

01:15:59.751 --> 01:16:03.322
...be thy name, thy
kingdom come, thy

01:16:03.388 --> 01:16:06.258
will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

01:16:06.325 --> 01:16:08.994
Give us this day
our daily bread,

01:16:09.061 --> 01:16:16.068
and forgive us our
trespasses as we forgive

01:16:16.134 --> 01:16:20.806
those who trespass
against us, and lead us

01:16:20.873 --> 01:16:27.312
not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil."

01:16:27.379 --> 01:16:28.982
Amen

01:16:29.047 --> 01:16:30.749
What does it mean?

01:16:30.816 --> 01:16:36.788
It means, show me, God,
how to want what you want.

01:16:45.999 --> 01:16:48.066
What are these two doing now?

01:16:49.067 --> 01:16:51.770
Come on, honey!
It's dinner!

01:16:55.874 --> 01:16:57.175
Hi, Eddie.

01:16:57.242 --> 01:16:58.877
Ho, ho, ho!

01:16:58.945 --> 01:16:59.678
Very funny.

01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:49.242
Morning, Eddie!

01:20:49.307 --> 01:20:51.510
Good morning!

01:20:58.251 --> 01:21:00.452
Yes!

01:21:52.337 --> 01:21:53.438
Holy-moly!

01:22:02.747 --> 01:22:04.783
It's a Christmas miracle.

01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:09.487
And it's not even Christmas.

01:22:09.554 --> 01:22:10.655
It is now.

01:22:30.109 --> 01:22:31.043
It's a miracle!

01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:32.611
Come see a miracle!

01:22:37.083 --> 01:22:38.317
Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:22:38.383 --> 01:22:39.885
Merry Christmas!

01:22:39.952 --> 01:22:42.721
Come to the field and see
it's a Christmas miracle!

01:22:42.787 --> 01:22:44.123
Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:45.690
Merry Christmas!

01:22:45.757 --> 01:22:48.027
Come to the field and see
it's a Christmas miracle!

01:22:48.094 --> 01:22:49.295
Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:22:49.362 --> 01:22:50.862
Merry Christmas!

01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:54.766
Come to the field and see
it's a Christmas miracle!

01:22:54.833 --> 01:22:58.770
Come to the field and see
it's a Christmas miracle!

01:22:58.837 --> 01:23:00.940
Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:23:01.007 --> 01:23:02.507
Merry Christmas!

01:23:14.954 --> 01:23:16.322
Hey!

01:23:16.389 --> 01:23:18.224
People on the
internet are trying

01:23:18.291 --> 01:23:20.525
to get my TV show back on.

01:23:20.592 --> 01:23:23.862
And I think my nose hairs
have stopped growing.

01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:25.364
Great!

01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:26.431
I'm happy for you.

01:23:40.079 --> 01:23:41.147
I got nothing.

01:23:44.649 --> 01:23:46.252
They're real!

01:23:46.319 --> 01:23:48.187
How did you do that?

01:23:48.254 --> 01:23:50.156
It's an act of God.

01:23:50.222 --> 01:23:52.158
He still works.

01:23:52.224 --> 01:23:55.460
But you know that.

01:23:55.527 --> 01:23:57.862
I owe you an apology.

01:23:57.930 --> 01:23:59.531
For what?

01:23:59.597 --> 01:24:02.134
I never asked you what
your wife was like.

01:24:06.172 --> 01:24:07.006
You're looking at her.

01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:15.114
You did those
Marines right, sir.

01:24:15.181 --> 01:24:16.315
Ouch.

01:24:16.382 --> 01:24:17.149
Did you tell him?

01:24:17.216 --> 01:24:18.150
Did you tell him?

01:24:18.217 --> 01:24:20.719
Tell me what?

01:24:20.785 --> 01:24:23.222
I'm going to get
her a proper ring.

01:24:23.289 --> 01:24:25.157
I'm proud of you.

01:24:25.224 --> 01:24:25.924
Yeah!

01:24:25.992 --> 01:24:27.792
You better!

01:24:28.928 --> 01:24:29.828
OK.

01:24:29.894 --> 01:24:32.465
OK.

01:24:36.235 --> 01:24:37.136
Yes. Yes!

01:24:37.203 --> 01:24:38.170
Yes!

01:24:38.237 --> 01:24:40.505
Let's have Christmas dinner!

01:25:16.409 --> 01:25:20.012
You must have run across
the entire state of Colorado

01:25:20.079 --> 01:25:25.217
yelling Merry Christmas to
get all these people here.

01:25:25.284 --> 01:25:27.652
It was on the internet.

01:25:27.719 --> 01:25:30.122
You shouldn't be
on the internet.

01:25:32.258 --> 01:25:34.460
It wasn't me.

01:25:34.527 --> 01:25:35.294
It was her.

01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:46.138
You did a great thing
for these people, dad.

01:25:50.509 --> 01:25:51.743
I did it to let your mom go.

01:25:57.249 --> 01:25:59.584
Let's eat!

01:25:59.651 --> 01:26:01.753
We should pray first.

01:26:05.391 --> 01:26:06.492
Just be honest.

01:26:06.559 --> 01:26:07.692
Say what's in your heart.

01:26:20.139 --> 01:26:26.579
God, thank you for making
those seeds grow into flowers

01:26:26.644 --> 01:26:27.879
so today can feel special.

01:26:31.584 --> 01:26:32.717
Thank you for Baby Jesus.

01:26:35.787 --> 01:26:39.291
I know Christmas isn't
about getting presents,

01:26:39.358 --> 01:26:42.328
but I see someone
brought chocolate cake...

01:26:43.661 --> 01:26:45.797
...so that's kind
of like a present.

01:26:45.864 --> 01:26:47.665
So thank you for that, too.

01:26:50.236 --> 01:26:58.511
But most of all, God, show
us how to want what you want.

01:26:58.577 --> 01:26:59.278
Amen.

01:26:59.345 --> 01:27:02.281
Amen.

01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:29.341
No, no, no.

01:27:29.408 --> 01:27:30.209
Nobody wants to hear me sing.

01:27:30.276 --> 01:27:32.278
Yes, we do!

01:27:34.113 --> 01:27:35.314
I don't know what to sing.

01:27:40.619 --> 01:27:41.886
OK.

01:27:41.954 --> 01:27:43.922
But I only know
one Christmas song.

01:27:43.989 --> 01:27:45.658
It's not Christmas.

01:27:45.723 --> 01:27:47.993
Yes, it is!

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:49.995
[SINGING] Deck the
hall with boughs

01:27:50.062 --> 01:27:54.567
of holly, fala lala la lala la.

01:27:54.633 --> 01:28:01.006
'Tis the season to be jolly
fala lala la lala la la.

01:28:01.073 --> 01:28:07.613
Don we know our gay apparel,
fala la lala la la la la.

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:13.751
Troll the ancient Yuletide
carol, fala lala la lala la la.

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.860
I want you to have this.

01:28:27.266 --> 01:28:29.535
There are so many important
stories in this book

01:28:29.602 --> 01:28:32.104
that you need to learn.

01:28:32.171 --> 01:28:34.073
Thank you.

01:28:35.207 --> 01:28:37.943
It's the road map
to a better life.

01:28:38.010 --> 01:28:41.347
It's been proven to work.

01:28:41.413 --> 01:28:42.348
Read it every day.

01:28:45.284 --> 01:28:46.818
That way, I'll see you again.

01:28:53.592 --> 01:28:56.262
What do you mean?

01:28:56.328 --> 01:29:00.099
Kid, it's time for
me to meet the Jesus

01:29:00.165 --> 01:29:02.501
I bumped into long ago.

01:29:02.568 --> 01:29:04.036
I'm going to get help!

01:29:04.103 --> 01:29:06.105
No.

01:29:09.241 --> 01:29:10.442
I want to be with my wife.

01:29:15.481 --> 01:29:17.383
[inaudible] but...

01:29:17.449 --> 01:29:20.286
It's OK.

01:29:20.352 --> 01:29:21.420
It's all right.

01:29:31.664 --> 01:29:32.864
Of course.

01:29:32.931 --> 01:29:34.866
The knot.

01:29:34.933 --> 01:29:36.101
What?

01:29:36.168 --> 01:29:38.604
The knot in the tree.

01:29:38.671 --> 01:29:40.872
What about it?

01:29:42.107 --> 01:29:43.208
Plug the chord into it.

01:34:26.525 --> 01:34:28.193
I can't wait for the sequel!

01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:32.464
No.
