20:40.160 --> 20:42.440
I'm Kerr James, I'm 13 years old,

20:42.440 --> 20:44.440
I live with my mum,
my dad and my sister.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.000
I've always loved music, and
I started busking about a year ago.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.200
When you go out,
everyone's so supportive.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.280
If someone stops,

20:51.280 --> 20:53.720
it's like a good compliment
because you don't have to.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.240
My family's all really supportive,
especially my mum and dad.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.920
They take me everywhere,
to every gig.

20:58.920 --> 21:01.400
The first audition
has changed my life.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.720
# Try a little tendern-e-e-ess... #

21:03.720 --> 21:05.840
The judges' reaction was amazing,

21:05.840 --> 21:08.400
and I honestly didn't think I was
going to get the comments I did.

21:08.400 --> 21:12.040
You came out with this real energy,
real optimism.

21:12.040 --> 21:15.560
You're good when you're different
and you're good when you stand out.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.680
I've watched Britain's Got Talent
since I was a wee boy,

21:17.680 --> 21:19.680
so it's a dream to be here.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.760
It would be absolutely amazing

21:21.760 --> 21:23.800
to perform
in front of the Royal Family.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.080
You don't get a chance to perform
in front of them every day.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.000
Especially Meghan.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.960
I like her.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.320
Oh, I hope she doesn't see this!

21:33.320 --> 21:35.720
When I perform,
it's like no-one's watching.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.280
Sometimes, I just get lost in it,
especially a song I connect to.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.840
I'm going to put everything
I've got into the performance,

21:40.840 --> 21:42.920
because this is the biggest
opportunity of my life.

21:42.920 --> 21:54.520
# Baby, there's nothing
holding me back... #

21:54.520 --> 21:56.440
# She packed my bags last night
pre-flight

21:56.440 --> 22:09.880
# Zero hour, 9am

22:09.880 --> 22:21.320
# And I'm gonna be
high as a kite by then

22:21.320 --> 22:24.960
# And I think it's gonna be
a long, long time

22:24.960 --> 22:27.960
# Till touchdown brings me
round again to find

22:27.960 --> 22:30.640
# I'm not the man
they think I am at home

22:30.640 --> 22:33.480
# Oh, no, no, no

22:33.480 --> 22:37.240
# I'm a rocket man

22:37.240 --> 22:39.840
# Rocket man

22:48.600 --> 22:55.840
# Mars ain't the kind of place
to raise your kids

22:55.840 --> 23:01.000
# In fact, it's cold as hell

My grandparents had a circus school

37:43.750 --> 37:46.270
and he was learning
to be a performer.

37:46.270 --> 37:48.950
But we've only actually
been performing

37:48.950 --> 37:50.950
for a year-and-a-half together.

37:50.950 --> 37:53.030
We travel all around the world.

37:53.030 --> 37:55.430
I've worked in Cirque du Soleil
for three years.

37:55.430 --> 37:58.230
When you work together,
you're 24/7 together.

37:58.230 --> 38:02.510
It's enough, I think!

38:02.510 --> 38:05.830
We had a standing ovation
from the audience, from the judges,

38:05.830 --> 38:09.670
so we were very happy
at the end of the audition.

38:09.670 --> 38:18.230
When David Walliams came on the
stage, I worried about my teeth.

38:18.230 --> 38:22.630
Last year, when I was training a new
trick, we fell from the mouthpiece.

38:22.630 --> 38:26.990
One of Alex's teeth broke.
It was a big scare.

38:26.990 --> 38:30.670
We're worried about the performance.

38:30.670 --> 38:33.590
We have elements
that we haven't used before.

38:33.590 --> 39:03.590
There's no safety harnesses,
so one small mistake could be fatal.

I'm 64 years old, and for me,

45:00.480 --> 45:02.400
ventriloquism's been
a lifelong journey.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.520
It's been 50 years,

45:04.520 --> 45:06.440
and I still remember
the feeling of excitement

45:06.440 --> 45:08.520
when I saw my first puppet.

45:08.520 --> 45:12.760
There it was,
sitting in a toyshop window.

45:12.760 --> 45:16.160
From that moment on, I knew what
I wanted to be   a ventriloquist!

45:16.160 --> 45:18.200
I wasn't the coolest.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.200
Hey, Jimmy.

45:20.200 --> 45:22.200
People used to laugh.

45:22.200 --> 45:27.600
But I knew what I wanted to do.

45:27.600 --> 45:35.480
My puppets and I went everywhere
together, from pubs to clubs.

45:35.480 --> 45:38.280
It's been a long road.

45:38.280 --> 45:41.800
I'm still working hard
on the circuit,

45:41.800 --> 45:46.280

It

It was

54:21.240 --> 54:21.600
agency.
It was good

54:21.600 --> 54:21.800
agency.
It was good but

54:28.520 --> 54:29.080
cheese into a frittata?
A

54:29.080 --> 54:29.560
cheese into a frittata?
A magician.

54:29.560 --> 54:29.760
cheese into a frittata?
A magician. So

54:29.760 --> 54:30.160
cheese into a frittata?
A magician. So am

A magician. So am I, in the kitchen.
It's

54:32.800 --> 54:32.960
A magician. So am I, in the kitchen.
It's Ben

54:32.960 --> 54:37.000
A magician. So am I, in the kitchen.
It's Ben Hart.

54:37.000 --> 54:37.200
A magician. So am I, in the kitchen.
It's Ben Hart.

54:37.200 --> 54:39.680
I often look at the world around us
in amazement,

54:39.680 --> 54:41.920
watching night turn into day
or winter turn into spring,

54:41.920 --> 54:44.280
seeing the first stalk of a plant
peeping through the soil.

54:44.280 --> 54:47.200
Learning to control the world around
me has been my lifelong obsession -

54:47.200 --> 54:49.960
controlling the uncontrollable,
making the impossible possible.

54:49.960 --> 54:53.360
Discovering real magic
has not been easy.

54:53.360 --> 54:56.880
Magic is beautiful,
breathtaking, thrilling.

54:56.880 --> 54:59.560
But some magic is terrifying...
and some secrets best kept secret.

54:59.560 --> 55:06.160
If the world around us can be
manipulated by a man, a magician,

55:06.160 --> 55:10.040
then pinch yourself
and ask yourself the question,

55:10.040 --> 55:13.840
do I really know where I am at this
moment in time, space and reality?

55:13.840 --> 55:15.880
Is this real?

55:15.880 --> 55:17.840
Is anything real?

55:17.840 --> 55:19.960
Every time I step on stage,

55:19.960 --> 55:22.360
I hear the words of Roald Dahl
ringing in my years.

55:22.360 --> 55:27.160
Above all, watch with glittering
eyes the whole world around you.

55:27.160 --> 55:30.400
The greatest secrets are always
hiding in the most unlikely places,

55:30.400 --> 55:45.280
and those who don't believe in magic
will never find it.

55:45.280 --> 55:52.040
Last time I came on the show,
I had a truckload of equipment,

55:52.040 --> 55:54.080
but it turns out I probably
shouldn't have bothered,

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.080
I'm Mark McMullan,
and I'm from Northern Ireland.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.440
My brother, Declan, and I
spent all our time together.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.680
My childhood wouldn't have been
anything near what it was

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.680
without him.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.760
Seven years ago, Declan took sick.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.080
It left him with a condition
called locked-in syndrome,

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.720
a form of brain damage that has left
him unable to move, unable to eat,

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.280
unable to see, unable to speak.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:36.960
I felt like I couldn't do anything
without him, and I just felt like...

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.960
I just... I don't know.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.480
Sorry.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:46.280
I haven't spoken about this
in a long time.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.240
# I guess I kinda liked the way
you help me escape... #

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.120
The only real outlet that Declan has
is that he can hear.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.600
Music is a big thing for him,

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.920
and it continues to help
the two of us stay connected.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:01.160
My dream is just to sing.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:04.360
I would love to be selling out
theatres around the world.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.920
This could be a turning point
in my life.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.280
I'm so glad to have the opportunity
in Britain's Got Talent

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:12.360
to take Declan
on that journey with me.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:27.360
He is my biggest inspiration.
