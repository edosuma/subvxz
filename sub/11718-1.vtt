Looks like your Five-O
task force is making an impact.

00:03.543 --> 00:05.944
Laura!

00:06.012 --> 00:07.880
Laura did not want anybody
to know that she was

00:07.964 --> 00:09.314
sending me evidence
from my father's toolbox.

00:09.382 --> 00:11.750
How do I tell Stan
that I'm leaving, and that

00:11.835 --> 00:12.935
I'm pregnant
with your child?

00:13.002 --> 00:14.703
That's the woman I saw.

00:14.754 --> 00:16.472
That's her. Number five.

00:16.539 --> 00:18.924
I think the governor's
hiding something.

00:19.008 --> 00:20.676
<i>Tell me you didn't break</i>
<i>into the governor's house.</i>

00:20.727 --> 00:22.044
I know what you did!

00:23.563 --> 00:26.148
I have everything under control.

00:26.215 --> 00:26.265
<i>Steve McGarrett,</i>
<i>you are under arrest.</i>

00:28.234 --> 00:30.018
- <i>Let him go.</i>
- <i>I can't let him go.</i>

00:30.069 --> 00:32.354
Yes, you can. We have
jurisdiction. We are Five-O.

00:32.405 --> 00:34.139
You don't understand.
There is no Five-O anymore.

McGarrett.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.067
You have a visitor.

01:59.759 --> 02:02.811
Why are you smiling at me?

02:02.862 --> 02:04.563
You're not wearing
a tie, it suits you.

02:04.631 --> 02:05.998
No, I'm not wearing a tie.

02:06.082 --> 02:08.917
'Cause there's no dress code
for an out-of-work cop.

02:12.038 --> 02:13.488
You get any leads on Wo Fat?

02:14.757 --> 02:17.876
Uh, no. Nothing yet.

02:17.961 --> 02:21.079
How's your family?
How's Rachel?

02:21.147 --> 02:22.681
She getting morning
sickness yet?

02:22.765 --> 02:25.183
Yeah, she's, uh...
She's excellent.

02:25.268 --> 02:27.135
Listen, I know you
don't like visitors,

02:27.186 --> 02:30.556
but this guy wouldn't
take no for an answer, so...

02:42.452 --> 02:45.804
Let me guess,
the governor had it coming?

02:48.791 --> 02:51.877
You, uh, you didn't have
to come down here, sir.

02:51.961 --> 02:53.528
You okay, son?

02:53.580 --> 02:55.380
I'm fine.

02:55.465 --> 02:56.982
Nothing Hell Week
didn't train me for.

02:58.668 --> 03:00.385
Your man tells me
the lieutenant governor's

03:00.470 --> 03:01.770
trying to move up your trial.

03:01.838 --> 03:04.923
I heard. The new guy, he
wants to show the public

03:05.008 --> 03:07.876
he's a zero tolerance
type, so convicting me

03:07.927 --> 03:10.562
of Governor Jameson's murder
is his first order of business.

03:11.848 --> 03:15.901
Well, we are here to make
sure that doesn't happen.

03:23.543 --> 03:25.911
Where do you think
you're going?

03:29.949 --> 03:32.084
Is there something
I can help you with?

03:33.753 --> 03:35.137
We know it was you.

03:35.204 --> 03:37.456
It's just a matter of time

03:37.540 --> 03:39.191
before you're trading places
with McGarrett.

03:48.768 --> 03:51.803
Congratulations on the
promotion, Lieutenant Kelly.

03:51.871 --> 03:55.040
Smart move, rejoining HPD.

04:13.409 --> 04:15.394
You got one hour.

04:41.654 --> 04:42.938
<i>My brother's dead, isn't he?</i>

04:43.006 --> 04:45.640
Then so's your father.

04:46.826 --> 04:47.993
No!

04:48.077 --> 04:49.061
Hello, Steve.

05:20.393 --> 05:22.277
Now listen to me
very carefully, Steve...

05:22.344 --> 05:24.930
Prisoner, step back!

05:26.199 --> 05:28.984
Step back!

05:29.035 --> 05:30.285
You hear me, Steve?

05:30.352 --> 05:31.519
You hear me?!

Hey.

06:16.382 --> 06:18.850
You should have to
arrest yourself for

06:18.918 --> 06:20.619
- breaking that seal, Lieutenant.
- It's okay.

06:20.686 --> 06:22.403
I brought a spare.

06:22.455 --> 06:23.571
You're Chin Ho Kelly, right?

06:23.623 --> 06:26.258
John McGarrett
spoke highly of you.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.510
Joe White.

06:28.577 --> 06:30.578
- How do you know John?
- We served together.

06:30.630 --> 06:33.849
He saved my ass more times
than I'd like to remember.

06:33.916 --> 06:35.167
I'm here to
return the favor.

06:35.234 --> 06:37.602
So. What's up, buddy?
You've been ducking me

06:37.687 --> 06:39.671
for about a week now.
- I've been a little busy.

06:39.739 --> 06:41.306
You've been busy?
What are you doing,

06:41.390 --> 06:42.757
putting more of your friends
behind bars?

06:42.809 --> 06:45.360
So you think I had a choice?

06:45.427 --> 06:47.479
Mm-hmm.
McGarrett was standing over

06:47.563 --> 06:49.831
the governor's body with
a gun in his hand, Danny.

06:49.899 --> 06:51.333
I had a full SWAT team

06:51.400 --> 06:53.201
right behind me, who saw
exactly the same things.

06:53.269 --> 06:54.669
Now, what was I
supposed to do?

06:54.737 --> 06:56.188
That's a good question.
I'm glad you asked.

06:56.255 --> 06:57.939
Because what I think
that you should have done

06:57.990 --> 06:59.007
is let Five-O investigate,

06:59.075 --> 07:00.959
instead of dismantling it.

07:01.043 --> 07:02.577
Instead of running off
and joining HPD.

07:02.628 --> 07:03.962
- Running off?
- Yeah.

07:04.046 --> 07:06.248
I knew that I could help
McGarrett more as a cop

07:06.299 --> 07:07.866
than as an unemployed civilian.

07:07.934 --> 07:09.251
Are you two done?

07:09.302 --> 07:11.219
Because I'm fairly certain
that this conversation

07:11.287 --> 07:12.787
isn't helping Steve one bit.

07:14.456 --> 07:17.042
I saw Wo Fat at the
funeral this morning.

07:17.109 --> 07:18.793
Hold on. You saw...
Why didn't you arrest him?

07:18.845 --> 07:21.179
With what?
We got nothing.

07:21.264 --> 07:23.732
Ballistics confirmed the gun
that McGarrett had in his hand

07:23.799 --> 07:24.883
was the murder weapon.

07:24.951 --> 07:26.351
And since it was
freshly discharged

07:26.435 --> 07:27.986
when Wo Fat put
it into his hand,

07:28.070 --> 07:30.555
lab found traces of GSR
on McGarrett's clothing.

07:30.623 --> 07:33.141
The key is gonna be proving
that he didn't fire it.

07:33.192 --> 07:34.726
Okay. Hold on.

07:34.794 --> 07:36.111
What about the security cameras?

07:36.162 --> 07:37.662
No, they were down.

07:37.747 --> 07:39.480
Steve disabled them all
during his break-in.

07:39.532 --> 07:41.733
So you got no footage of the
real killer coming or going?

07:41.801 --> 07:42.784
No.

07:42.835 --> 07:44.052
All right.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.570
Steve got blasted in the neck
with a stun gun.

07:45.638 --> 07:48.039
He got marks on his neck.
What about that?

07:48.124 --> 07:49.824
Prosecuting attorney will
have that tossed out.

07:49.876 --> 07:51.409
McGarrett took out
the governor's

07:51.477 --> 07:54.462
entire security detail.
They can easily make the case

07:54.513 --> 07:55.931
that any physical
trauma occurred then.

07:57.633 --> 07:59.834
Sounds like we got a lot
of work ahead of us.

07:59.886 --> 08:02.103
Do you guys have a dossier
on this Wo Fat character?

08:02.171 --> 08:04.239
Jenna Kaye does.
She used to work for the CIA.

08:04.307 --> 08:06.191
Well, I'll try not to
hold that against her.

08:06.275 --> 08:07.342
Where can I find her?

08:07.393 --> 08:09.261
Mahalo Inn. Room 17.

08:09.328 --> 08:11.196
I know the place.
Do me a favor.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.348
Give her a ring, tell
her I'm on my way.

08:15.868 --> 08:18.403
He, uh, he trained Steve.
Oh.

08:18.487 --> 08:19.654
So it's his fault?

08:20.907 --> 08:23.691
I spoke to Kono,
and she's not taking

08:23.743 --> 08:25.160
her suspension very well.

08:25.211 --> 08:26.161
Yeah.

08:26.212 --> 08:27.262
IA's not backing off.

08:27.330 --> 08:28.780
The investigation's
still ongoing.

08:28.848 --> 08:30.365
They want her badge, Danny.

08:32.717 --> 08:36.004
You, my friend,
are a ray of sunshine today.

08:36.054 --> 08:37.472
It's really good to see you.

08:37.539 --> 08:39.441
Yeah.

08:39.508 --> 08:40.808
Williams.

08:42.711 --> 08:43.794
When?

08:43.863 --> 08:45.046
Okay.

08:45.097 --> 08:46.381
Don't move. I'm on my way.

08:46.432 --> 08:49.034
What, this was
your plan all along?

08:49.101 --> 08:51.719
Huh? Frame McGarrett, get him in
here so you could take him out?

08:51.771 --> 08:53.855
I wasn't trying to kill him.
I was trying to save his life.

08:53.906 --> 08:55.807
T-trying to save his life?

08:55.875 --> 08:57.359
Believe me,
if I wanted to gut the man,

08:57.410 --> 08:58.777
I would've done it.

08:58.861 --> 09:00.561
I stabbed him in the abdomen,
low and to the center,

09:00.613 --> 09:02.647
avoiding all the vital organs.
- Why would you do that?

09:03.783 --> 09:05.733
<i>Because...</i>

09:05.785 --> 09:08.386
<i>that would give him</i>
<i>the best chance to escape.</i>

09:10.189 --> 09:11.406
<i>Escape?</i>

09:11.457 --> 09:12.641
What the hell you
talking about, escape?

09:12.708 --> 09:15.226
What do you mean?

09:15.294 --> 09:18.396
I told McGarrett that Wo Fat
ordered me to kill him.

09:18.464 --> 09:20.382
If Wo Fat wanted
to kill McGarrett,

09:20.449 --> 09:21.916
why didn't he just do it
when he killed the governor?

09:21.968 --> 09:24.752
You're the detective,
I'm sure you can figure it out.

09:25.955 --> 09:27.989
He needed the governor
out of the way

09:28.057 --> 09:30.508
so he pinned her murder
on McGarrett.

09:30.576 --> 09:32.060
And when McGarrett's killed
in prison by the man

09:32.128 --> 09:34.179
he put away, no one asks
any questions. Is that it?

09:34.246 --> 09:36.398
You two catch on fast.

09:44.423 --> 09:46.875
Still doesn't explain
why you didn't follow orders.

09:46.942 --> 09:49.160
I may be a soulless bastard,
Detective, but I'm no fool.

09:49.245 --> 09:51.162
Wo Fat is making one last deal,

09:51.247 --> 09:52.664
and then he's going
to disappear.

09:52.748 --> 09:55.367
He's not going to do that
without tying up loose ends.

09:55.434 --> 09:56.868
And by loose ends,
you mean you, right?

09:56.936 --> 09:59.287
Unless McGarrett
kills him first.

10:28.297 --> 10:30.031
Still no sign of Steve,
but HPD's out in full force.

10:30.098 --> 10:31.883
They want to deploy me
in the field to help coordinate.

10:31.950 --> 10:34.681
Okay, listen. I need to set
up shop here, at my place.

10:34.682 --> 10:35.852
Hey.

10:35.910 --> 10:37.370
- What are you doing here?
- Heard about McGarrett.

10:37.396 --> 10:38.404
What does he think he's doing?

10:38.730 --> 10:40.225
He's going after Wo Fat.

10:40.442 --> 10:42.126
Okay. So we have to help him.

10:42.194 --> 10:43.477
Yeah, that's gonna be
a little difficult,

10:43.562 --> 10:44.512
considering who
we're dealing with.

10:44.580 --> 10:46.213
Okay, Steve will
not contact us.

10:46.281 --> 10:48.132
He won't want us implicated
for aiding and abetting.

10:48.183 --> 10:50.718
Okay. So we have
to find Wo Fat first.

10:50.786 --> 10:52.887
Will Ling might know
where he is.

10:52.955 --> 10:54.589
- Will Ling? Who's Will Ling?
- One of Wo Fat's lapdogs

10:54.656 --> 10:57.975
who happened to, uh, drop
his wallet at the cemetery.

10:58.026 --> 10:59.393
Nice.

10:59.461 --> 11:02.113
If we follow this guy, he's
bound to lead us to his boss.

11:02.164 --> 11:04.148
I can run his ID, trace his
cell, run surveillance.

11:04.199 --> 11:05.449
How are you gonna do that?

11:05.500 --> 11:06.701
You don't have access
to HPD's database.

11:06.785 --> 11:07.818
I'll use your password.

11:07.869 --> 11:09.770
- Oh! That's not a good idea.
- What?

11:09.838 --> 11:11.389
You're not carrying
a badge anymore, Kono.

11:11.456 --> 11:13.557
I can't guarantee HPD back up.

11:13.625 --> 11:15.259
You guys are my back up.

11:15.327 --> 11:17.295
Definitely been hanging out
with McGarrett too long now.

11:17.346 --> 11:18.930
Okay, so do we have a plan
or what?

11:18.997 --> 11:20.381
Yes, we have a plan.

11:20.465 --> 11:22.216
You go after Ling-- let us know
if you find anything.

11:22.301 --> 11:23.834
In the meantime,
we need to find McGarrett

11:23.885 --> 11:26.270
before HPD does, okay?

11:51.246 --> 11:53.180
♪ ♪

12:48.603 --> 12:50.087
♪ ♪

13:39.321 --> 13:40.755
The car bomb in Hangzhou,
that was him?

13:40.822 --> 13:41.972
You heard of it?

13:42.023 --> 13:43.640
Yeah, you could
say that.

13:43.692 --> 13:47.811
This Wo Fat likes to
get his hands dirty.

13:47.863 --> 13:49.430
Hmm.

13:49.498 --> 13:50.981
Now that we've exposed him,

13:51.032 --> 13:52.816
he's taken a more active role
in his own self-preservation.

13:52.868 --> 13:55.419
This is very thorough.

13:55.487 --> 13:57.104
You seem to know him
pretty well.

13:57.172 --> 13:58.956
This one was personal to me.

14:01.659 --> 14:04.128
It's Danny.

14:04.179 --> 14:06.180
Hey.

14:06.264 --> 14:08.332
What happened?

14:08.383 --> 14:11.252
Yeah, I'll tell him
right now.

14:11.319 --> 14:14.004
McGarrett escaped from prison.

14:14.055 --> 14:15.272
Patience was never
his strong suit.

14:15.340 --> 14:16.507
Well, we should
get going.

14:16.558 --> 14:17.808
They're gonna
need our help.

14:17.859 --> 14:20.010
These things belonged
to John McGarrett, right?

14:20.061 --> 14:21.345
Yeah. What does
that matter?

14:22.898 --> 14:25.232
I don't know.

14:25.317 --> 14:27.568
I'm gonna take this,
if you don't mind.

14:28.787 --> 14:30.271
Sure. Where are you going?

14:30.338 --> 14:31.605
McGarrett needs our help.
He'll be fine.

14:31.673 --> 14:33.457
What do you mean,
he'll be fine?

14:33.525 --> 14:35.476
How do you know?
I trained him.

15:08.944 --> 15:12.012
911. What is your emergency?

15:18.154 --> 15:20.072
Commander McGarrett?

15:20.123 --> 15:23.325
Commander McGarrett,
can you hear me?

15:30.950 --> 15:32.784
Max, least you can do

15:32.836 --> 15:34.837
after patching me up
is call me Steve.

15:34.921 --> 15:37.556
Oh. Well, thank you...

15:37.623 --> 15:38.924
Steve.

15:38.975 --> 15:41.143
I'm sorry I broke in
your house.

15:41.227 --> 15:43.295
I, um...

15:43.346 --> 15:45.631
I didn't really have
anywhere else to go.

15:45.698 --> 15:47.465
No apology is necessary.

15:47.517 --> 15:50.502
In fact, I'm quite humbled
that you feel comfortable

15:50.603 --> 15:52.521
enough to come to me.

15:52.605 --> 15:56.641
However, I am curious as to how
you acquired that wound.

15:56.693 --> 15:59.611
I'm guessing
that it was

15:59.662 --> 16:02.714
a crudely sharpened piece
of unsterilized metal...

16:02.782 --> 16:04.066
I got shanked in prison, Max.

16:04.133 --> 16:06.118
Oh.

16:06.186 --> 16:08.653
So then...

16:08.705 --> 16:12.724
you didn't come by that uniform
in a legal manner?

16:12.792 --> 16:14.843
You don't watch the news,
do you?

16:14.928 --> 16:16.228
I try not to.

16:16.296 --> 16:17.329
It's very scary.

16:18.631 --> 16:22.384
My roommate is visiting
family on the mainland.

16:22.468 --> 16:25.187
You two are approximately
the same size.

16:26.222 --> 16:27.956
Thanks, buddy.

16:32.896 --> 16:34.346
Who is it?

16:34.397 --> 16:35.397
It's all right.
Max, don't get the door.

16:35.481 --> 16:36.848
It's all right.

16:36.900 --> 16:39.151
Max, don't answer the door!

16:41.204 --> 16:43.855
What the hell is

16:43.907 --> 16:46.325
the matter with you, huh?
What is the matter with you?!

16:46.376 --> 16:48.744
Breaking outta jail,
taking out a cop?!

16:48.828 --> 16:49.778
Have you lost
your mind?

16:49.846 --> 16:51.430
Why are you yelling at me?

16:51.497 --> 16:53.615
- I'm not yelling at you!
- Actually, you were

16:53.683 --> 16:55.467
expressing yourself
in a very loud manner.

16:55.534 --> 16:58.804
Hey, zip it, Kermit, okay?
Have you lost your mind?

16:58.871 --> 17:01.857
- What choice did I have, Danny?
- What <i>choice</i> did you have?

17:01.925 --> 17:03.342
- Shh, shh! Shh, shh.
- What does that even mean?!

17:03.393 --> 17:04.675
You all right?

17:04.727 --> 17:08.380
Thank you for asking, Chin.
Yeah, I'm all right!

17:08.431 --> 17:11.215
- Thanks to Max.
- Mahalo for calling.

17:11.267 --> 17:12.800
Anybody follow you guys?

17:12.868 --> 17:15.153
Undercover unit tried to, but
we managed to shake the tail.

17:15.221 --> 17:17.472
Hey, heard you stole a squad
car-- where'd you ditch it?

17:17.540 --> 17:19.992
A few blocks south.
It's behind a construction site.

17:20.059 --> 17:21.059
I'll take it up

17:21.109 --> 17:22.493
to the North Shore,
distract HPD.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.479
You <i>are</i> HPD, Chin. You remember?

17:24.547 --> 17:26.832
Hey, just 'cause
the badge says HPD,

17:26.898 --> 17:28.367
doesn't mean I'm not Five-O.

17:28.417 --> 17:30.235
You know that.

17:30.286 --> 17:31.954
You did what you had
to do, okay?

17:32.038 --> 17:34.122
Right now, I want to find
Wo Fat. You understand?

17:34.207 --> 17:35.374
Kono's following one
of his guys right now.

17:35.425 --> 17:37.075
As soon as we get eyes on him,
we'll be there.

17:38.528 --> 17:41.129
Hello. Yeah, he's right here

17:41.214 --> 17:42.681
I'll put you on speakerphone.

17:42.748 --> 17:45.100
Steve, you okay?

17:45.184 --> 17:46.335
Yes, sir.

17:46.402 --> 17:47.569
Where are you?

17:47.637 --> 17:49.421
I found someone
you need to talk to.

17:49.472 --> 17:51.974
5423 Puuikena Drive.

17:52.058 --> 17:53.442
I'll be waiting out front.

17:53.526 --> 17:54.843
Copy that. I'm on my way.

17:54.911 --> 17:56.979
Whoa-whoa. What do you mean,
you're on your way?

17:57.063 --> 17:58.280
You're not on your way anywhere.

17:58.364 --> 17:59.597
You're a fugitive,
you remember that?

17:59.649 --> 18:00.765
You heard the man.
He's got something.

18:00.817 --> 18:02.818
Yeah, I heard him.
We all heard him.

18:02.902 --> 18:05.337
He doesn't have anything.
He's got an address, that's all!

18:05.405 --> 18:07.956
Unless Master Yoda can send
telepathic messages

18:08.024 --> 18:10.108
that the rest of us
cannot hear...

18:10.159 --> 18:13.028
Actually, Yoda technically
didn't have telepathic powers.

18:13.096 --> 18:14.363
Seriously?
Right now?

18:14.430 --> 18:17.516
Please. Please listen to me.

18:17.583 --> 18:20.552
Is there any way that I can
talk you out of this?

18:20.619 --> 18:23.455
- Has it ever worked before, Danny?
- No.

18:23.506 --> 18:25.340
- Okay, so let's go, yeah?
- Okay.

18:25.408 --> 18:26.758
Wait-wait-wait.

18:26.809 --> 18:29.127
You guys can't take your car.
HPD's gonna be on

18:29.178 --> 18:30.462
the look out for it.

18:30.513 --> 18:32.414
Then perhaps I can help.

18:38.621 --> 18:41.139
Yes, you are. Yes, you...

18:41.190 --> 18:44.309
100%, you are a monkey
in a polka dot dress.

18:44.360 --> 18:47.396
And I love you and I'm very
happy that I will see you

18:47.463 --> 18:50.065
in a couple days, okay?
That's right.

18:50.133 --> 18:51.800
Danno loves you.

18:51.868 --> 18:53.335
All right, babe. All right.

18:55.071 --> 18:57.155
You know, I could be wrong,
it's rare,

18:57.206 --> 18:58.656
but you don't look happy.

18:58.708 --> 19:01.510
Well, I am happy
on the inside.

19:01.594 --> 19:02.794
You're a bad liar.

19:02.845 --> 19:03.995
What are you doing?

19:04.047 --> 19:05.881
Get down.
You're supposed to be

19:05.965 --> 19:07.416
the invisible man.
Would you get down?

19:07.483 --> 19:08.800
- Why are you changing the subject?
- I'm not changing the subject.

19:08.851 --> 19:10.218
You are changing the subject,
Danny. What's going on?

19:10.303 --> 19:13.972
Put your head down! Rachel is
moving back to Hawaii, okay?

19:14.023 --> 19:15.724
You told me
she was staying in Jersey.

19:15.808 --> 19:17.008
Why she moving back to Hawaii?

19:19.312 --> 19:20.645
She's, uh,

19:20.696 --> 19:23.532
she's moving back in
with Stan.

19:26.702 --> 19:28.236
Oh, man.

19:30.873 --> 19:32.207
The baby's his?

19:33.543 --> 19:37.529
Turns out she's further along
than she thought.

19:37.580 --> 19:39.714
And so she's gonna try

19:39.799 --> 19:42.867
to make it work with Stan
for the, for the kid's sake.

19:42.919 --> 19:46.471
Would you get down, please?
Would you please get down?

19:50.760 --> 19:53.011
I'm sorry, Danny.

19:53.062 --> 19:54.346
I'm fine.

19:54.397 --> 19:55.764
It didn't work out
the first time,

19:55.848 --> 19:58.016
so who's to this time would be
any different, right?

20:01.270 --> 20:02.737
Please don't look at me
like that.

20:02.822 --> 20:06.241
I said I'm fine. I'm asking you
not to give me that look, okay?

20:06.325 --> 20:09.361
I'm more worried
about my car, okay?

20:30.416 --> 20:32.083
Okay, I'll take it
from here.

20:32.135 --> 20:34.436
Actually, I'm enjoying myself
very much.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.354
I may even cash in

20:36.422 --> 20:37.589
my prehistoric fossil collection

20:37.640 --> 20:39.875
to put a down payment on one
of these bad boys.

20:39.942 --> 20:41.743
Come on.

20:41.811 --> 20:44.596
Also, if I don't drive,
I get carsick.

20:44.647 --> 20:46.381
Just don't get pulled over.

20:51.487 --> 20:53.038
Hey, what ya got?

20:53.105 --> 20:55.390
Hey, I got your lapdog.

20:55.458 --> 20:58.126
But so far, no sign of Wo Fat.

20:59.829 --> 21:03.064
Wait. Who's this <i>haole?</i>

21:03.132 --> 21:03.215
He doesn't look like
one of Wo Fat's crew.

21:05.334 --> 21:07.135
He could be part of the deal
Wo Fat's trying

21:07.220 --> 21:08.136
to pull off.

21:08.221 --> 21:09.304
All right, I'll get a picture

21:09.388 --> 21:10.788
and run it through
facial recognition.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.591
Call me when you get a hit.

21:34.947 --> 21:36.064
Recognize this?

21:36.132 --> 21:38.600
Yeah, it was in
my father's toolbox.

21:38.668 --> 21:41.453
It belonged to a man named
Hideki Mokoto,

21:41.504 --> 21:42.837
former Japanese pilot.

21:42.922 --> 21:45.423
He earned that medal
for bombing Pearl Harbor.

21:45.491 --> 21:48.443
- He gave it to your father.
- Why?

21:48.511 --> 21:50.828
He wants to tell you that
himself.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.830
Wait a minute,
this guy's still alive?

21:52.882 --> 21:54.366
Through that door.

22:13.619 --> 22:17.822
You have his eyes.

22:17.890 --> 22:20.308
<i>Let me just get this straight.</i>

22:20.376 --> 22:22.360
After Pearl Harbor,
this guy strikes it rich,

22:22.411 --> 22:24.879
very rich, obviously,
and he decides

22:24.964 --> 22:28.466
to move here and dedicate his
life to cleaning up this island?

22:28.534 --> 22:31.136
- He called it a personal atonement.
- Aha.

22:31.203 --> 22:33.471
<i>And how does McGarrett's</i>
<i>father come into play?</i>

22:33.539 --> 22:35.724
<i>They met at a memorial service</i>
<i>for the</i> Arizona

22:35.791 --> 22:38.643
<i>where Steve's grandfather died.</i>
<i>And it was there</i>

22:38.711 --> 22:42.380
<i>that Mokoto approached John</i>
<i>and asked for his forgiveness.</i>

22:42.431 --> 22:44.983
Ultimately the two
of them became friends.

22:45.050 --> 22:46.935
A couple years later
Mokoto hired him.

22:47.019 --> 22:48.687
He'd gotten upset

22:48.738 --> 22:50.238
over corruption in
the police department

22:50.323 --> 22:51.823
and local politics.

22:51.890 --> 22:53.224
So he asked John

22:53.276 --> 22:56.328
to secretly conduct
an investigation.

22:56.395 --> 22:57.662
Okay, and that's when
John finds out

22:57.730 --> 22:59.836
that the governor's in bed
with Wo Fat.

22:59.861 --> 23:00.915
Yeah.

23:00.916 --> 23:04.002
And before he died,
John told Mokoto

23:04.069 --> 23:05.337
that he had the evidence

23:05.404 --> 23:07.505
that would prove it.
- What evidence?

23:07.573 --> 23:08.707
Mokoto didn't know.

23:08.758 --> 23:11.576
All John said was
that he hid it on Molokai.

23:11.627 --> 23:13.911
Why didn't he tell me?

23:24.607 --> 23:29.027
Everything your father did

23:29.094 --> 23:32.263
was to protect his family.

24:14.023 --> 24:15.640
Gotcha.

24:39.739 --> 24:42.224
We found this
in her car.

24:51.050 --> 24:52.789
Tell me, Ms. Kalakaua,

24:52.790 --> 24:54.724
what are you doing here?

24:54.792 --> 24:56.960
It can't be official business,
you're suspended.

24:57.027 --> 24:58.895
So you know who I am.

24:58.962 --> 25:00.647
Is that supposed
to intimidate me?

25:00.731 --> 25:01.898
No.

25:01.965 --> 25:03.400
That's their job.

25:05.986 --> 25:07.337
I'm just a businessman.

25:07.405 --> 25:10.690
So what are you selling
to Kurt Hauff?

25:16.747 --> 25:20.750
The Japanese have a saying:

25:20.818 --> 25:23.920
<i>Iwanu ga hana.</i>

25:23.987 --> 25:25.505
"Not speaking

25:25.589 --> 25:27.140
is the flower."

25:31.378 --> 25:33.430
Good day, Ms. Kalakaua.

25:37.017 --> 25:38.334
Here you go.

25:38.385 --> 25:40.453
Mahalo.

25:43.257 --> 25:45.291
Hi. I was wondering

25:45.359 --> 25:47.010
if I could use your bathroom?

25:47.077 --> 25:48.228
Of course.

25:48.312 --> 25:49.796
You're going to have to buy

25:49.864 --> 25:51.865
a shave ice first.

25:51.949 --> 25:54.951
Come on, Kamekona, seriously?

25:55.018 --> 25:56.853
Let me give you a tip.

25:56.904 --> 26:00.206
The key to undercover work--
you got to make it look real.

26:00.291 --> 26:02.325
I'll have a cherry.

26:02.376 --> 26:04.627
With ice cream or adzuki beans?

26:04.695 --> 26:05.778
I don't care. You choose.

26:05.846 --> 26:09.149
Beans definitely.

26:12.419 --> 26:13.353
Hey, hungry?

26:13.420 --> 26:15.037
It's part of my cover.

26:15.089 --> 26:16.473
I think I have something.

26:16.540 --> 26:17.624
It's the locker key

26:17.691 --> 26:19.041
from your father's toolbox.

26:19.093 --> 26:20.226
Based on Mokoto's intel,

26:20.294 --> 26:21.494
I traced it to the airport
on Molokai.

26:21.562 --> 26:23.897
That's where your father
hid the evidence.

26:47.188 --> 26:49.071
Looks like someone set up
a hidden camera.

26:49.123 --> 26:50.490
Wait, wait, wait.

26:50.558 --> 26:52.125
That's the governor's study.

26:52.209 --> 26:53.426
Yeah, looks like it.

26:53.511 --> 26:54.761
Who's this guy?

27:01.468 --> 27:04.237
That's my father.

27:13.781 --> 27:15.398
This camera--
what if it's still there?

27:15.449 --> 27:17.183
If that's the case,

27:17.251 --> 27:18.601
then the governor's murder

27:18.652 --> 27:20.403
may have been captured on video,
right?

27:30.164 --> 27:32.498
This is Detective Chang.

27:32.583 --> 27:34.884
I think I may have found
our fugitive.

27:46.664 --> 27:48.197
We'd better be right about this,

27:48.265 --> 27:50.433
or we're going to be sharing
a cell with McGarrett.

27:50.484 --> 27:52.301
I call top bunk.

27:52.353 --> 27:54.237
Looks like the camera was
pointed in this direction.

27:56.473 --> 27:58.324
Yeah, this is it.
This is the angle right here.

27:59.610 --> 28:01.911
Okay, come on.

28:07.801 --> 28:09.035
Chin.

28:14.324 --> 28:16.175
That could be
a lens right there.

28:18.012 --> 28:19.862
You didn't happen to bring
your screwdriver, did you?

28:19.930 --> 28:22.649
Screw...? I left it at home
with my hammer.

28:29.857 --> 28:31.624
What do you think you're doing?

28:32.843 --> 28:34.477
This is the governor's
residence.

28:34.528 --> 28:36.596
Who are you and what
are you doing here?

28:36.664 --> 28:37.997
Lieutenant Governor Denning,

28:38.065 --> 28:39.832
uh, I'm
Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly.

28:39.900 --> 28:41.100
This is
Detective Danny Williams.

28:41.168 --> 28:43.319
We're very sorry
to intrude like this.

28:43.370 --> 28:46.205
Wait a minute--
Williams... Kelly?

28:46.290 --> 28:48.190
From Five-O?

28:48.242 --> 28:50.410
I thought that was dismantled.

28:50.477 --> 28:52.629
Yes, sir, it was.
But we have reason to believe

28:52.696 --> 28:55.081
that there's a key piece of
evidence here that has to do

28:55.149 --> 28:56.699
with the governor's murder.

28:56.750 --> 28:58.217
What kind of evidence?

29:03.707 --> 29:06.759
Your big friend out there
is quite the entrepreneur.

29:06.844 --> 29:09.762
He's telling me all about his
plans to open a shrimp truck.

29:09.830 --> 29:11.514
He asked me
if I wanted

29:11.565 --> 29:13.149
to get in on the ground floor.

29:13.216 --> 29:15.435
Kamekona's good people.

29:15.519 --> 29:17.520
You got a lot of good people
around you.

29:17.571 --> 29:19.005
You put together a nice team.

29:20.924 --> 29:22.442
Are you okay, son?

29:22.509 --> 29:24.093
You've been
awful quiet

29:24.161 --> 29:26.162
ever since we left Mokoto's.

29:26.229 --> 29:28.264
What's on your mind?

29:35.506 --> 29:38.791
I was only 15 years old
when my father sent me away.

29:38.876 --> 29:41.010
He did that to protect you.

29:41.078 --> 29:43.596
I know, I know.

29:43.681 --> 29:45.598
But then I joined the service.

29:45.683 --> 29:47.216
All right, I got deployed.

29:47.267 --> 29:49.936
I didn't get a lot of time
to spend with him

29:50.020 --> 29:51.304
as an adult.

29:51.388 --> 29:53.255
And now I'm realizing
there's all this stuff

29:53.307 --> 29:54.891
about him that I never knew.

29:54.942 --> 29:57.593
He had all these secrets,
and it bugs me.

29:59.396 --> 30:00.863
Well, when this is over,

30:00.931 --> 30:02.865
maybe we can shed some light
on those secrets.

30:02.933 --> 30:05.735
Maybe we shouldn't.

30:05.786 --> 30:07.370
Why?

30:07.437 --> 30:10.456
Wo Fat warned me not to dig
into my family's past.

30:10.541 --> 30:12.375
He said I might not
like what I find.

30:12.442 --> 30:14.043
What did he mean by that?

30:14.111 --> 30:18.247
Listen, son, you may not
have known your father,

30:18.298 --> 30:19.665
but he knew you.

30:19.733 --> 30:21.450
When you were
training at Coronado,

30:21.502 --> 30:22.969
he called to check
in with me every week

30:23.053 --> 30:24.504
to see how you were doing.

30:24.571 --> 30:27.256
And as for when
you were younger,

30:27.307 --> 30:30.093
well, trust me,
that was as hard on him

30:30.144 --> 30:31.427
as it was on you.

30:31.478 --> 30:33.379
In the 34 years

30:33.447 --> 30:37.466
I knew your father,
I saw him cry twice.

30:37.518 --> 30:41.587
At your mother's funeral,
and the day he sent you away.

30:47.411 --> 30:50.113
He was a good man.

30:50.164 --> 30:53.599
And there's no reason
to think otherwise.

30:57.271 --> 30:58.771
We got company.

31:13.887 --> 31:16.889
McGarrett, we have
the building surrounded.

31:16.957 --> 31:18.941
Come out with your hands up.

31:19.009 --> 31:20.342
What are you going to do?

31:22.012 --> 31:23.846
Yeah, brah,
just give us the word.

31:36.710 --> 31:37.794
Down.

31:37.861 --> 31:40.246
Down! On your knees now!

31:40.314 --> 31:41.547
Get down, McGarrett!

31:41.632 --> 31:42.715
Lock him up.

31:44.718 --> 31:46.385
I want those two arrested

31:46.453 --> 31:48.638
- for harboring a fugitive.
- Listen to me--

31:48.705 --> 31:50.056
they have nothing to do
with this, okay?

31:50.140 --> 31:51.557
I forced them to help,
you understand?

31:51.642 --> 31:53.092
They have nothing
to do with this.

31:53.160 --> 31:54.744
Hey.

31:54.812 --> 31:56.579
Let him go.

31:56.647 --> 31:58.514
You heard the man,
get the cuffs off him.

31:58.565 --> 32:01.100
What the hell is this about?
Just relax, okay?

32:01.168 --> 32:02.351
You have the wrong man,
Detective.

32:02.402 --> 32:04.770
McGarrett's innocent.

32:04.838 --> 32:07.907
He didn't kill the governor.

32:09.576 --> 32:11.677
I am not the enemy, Steve.

32:11.745 --> 32:14.263
I have always been loyal
to the people

32:14.331 --> 32:15.998
who are loyal to me.

32:16.066 --> 32:17.617
Is that why you had
Laura Hills murdered?

32:17.684 --> 32:20.269
Because she was disloyal?

32:20.337 --> 32:23.339
Yes.

32:27.361 --> 32:30.079
What are we going to do?
We have to get rid of him.

32:30.130 --> 32:32.515
I have everything under control.

32:34.768 --> 32:37.520
You can't even see it's him.
You can't even see it's Wo Fat.

32:37.587 --> 32:39.055
No, but what we do clearly see,

32:39.106 --> 32:40.556
is that you didn't kill
the governor.

32:40.607 --> 32:44.310
Commander McGarrett, you
have my sincerest apologies

32:44.394 --> 32:46.395
for everything
you've been through.

32:46.446 --> 32:48.731
All due respect, sir,
I don't need your apologies.

32:48.782 --> 32:50.116
What I need you to do

32:50.200 --> 32:51.484
is reinstate
my Five-O task force

32:51.568 --> 32:54.020
so we can go after
this son of a bitch right here.

32:59.042 --> 33:03.663
Well, there is no doubt that
Five-O had an impact on crime,

33:03.730 --> 33:06.448
so as lieutenant governor,
I'll grant your request.

33:09.786 --> 33:11.170
All right. Thank you, sir.

33:11.255 --> 33:13.289
But there are
conditions.

33:13.340 --> 33:14.757
What conditions?

33:16.310 --> 33:19.061
Governor Jameson gave you
full immunity and means

33:19.129 --> 33:21.097
to basically
run roughshod

33:21.148 --> 33:22.832
over ever single law
on the state's books.

33:22.900 --> 33:26.068
That's not going to happen
on my watch.

33:26.136 --> 33:29.372
You cross the line,
you answer to me.

33:32.142 --> 33:34.010
Understood, sir.

33:34.077 --> 33:36.112
But just so we're clear,

33:36.163 --> 33:38.414
sometimes we get put
in positions

33:38.481 --> 33:40.750
where lives are on the line
and we have to make

33:40.817 --> 33:42.368
split-second decisions,
and when that happens,

33:42.452 --> 33:45.338
the line you're talking about
gets a little hard to see.

33:45.422 --> 33:47.373
Fair enough.

33:49.276 --> 33:51.243
I'll reinstate
Detective Williams

33:51.311 --> 33:52.545
and Lieutenant Kelly
immediately.

33:52.629 --> 33:54.196
Don't forget
about Officer Kalakaua.

33:54.264 --> 33:55.881
She needs to be cleared
of all the charges

33:55.966 --> 33:57.717
pending against her as well.

33:57.784 --> 33:59.218
I'm afraid that
won't be possible.

33:59.303 --> 34:01.854
I'm told Officer Kalakaua
is still being investigated

34:01.939 --> 34:03.139
by Internal Affairs.

34:03.190 --> 34:05.107
They'll need to complete
that investigation

34:05.175 --> 34:08.293
to determine whether or not
she's fit for duty.

34:08.362 --> 34:10.112
Let's go.

34:10.179 --> 34:11.714
Hey.

34:11.782 --> 34:13.366
Where is, uh, Kono anyway?

34:13.433 --> 34:14.734
I don't know.

34:14.818 --> 34:16.685
She was supposed to check in
an hour ago.

34:44.313 --> 34:45.848
You won't shoot.
You're a cop.

34:47.534 --> 34:50.335
You see a badge?

34:54.241 --> 34:56.058
Lieutenant Kelly.
Chin, you have to get

34:56.109 --> 34:57.360
to Ko'Olina Marina, pier 49.

34:57.411 --> 34:58.527
That's where Wo Fat is.

34:58.578 --> 34:59.812
The deal's going down now.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.114
Once it's done,
he's going to disappear.

35:15.096 --> 35:16.296
That's it.

35:17.736 --> 35:18.936
We're too late.

35:19.965 --> 35:21.165
I got the buyer.

35:21.948 --> 35:23.929
I'll cover her.
You guys go after the boat.

36:04.810 --> 36:06.727
- I'm Joe.
- Kono.

36:06.778 --> 36:07.778
Nice shooting, Kono.

36:17.573 --> 36:18.923
I wouldn't touch that.

36:18.991 --> 36:20.274
Call Homeland Security.

36:20.325 --> 36:21.826
Tell them to get
their people out here.

36:21.910 --> 36:24.445
Looks like we got the raw
materials for a dirty bomb.

36:47.653 --> 36:49.303
Chin, take the wheel!

36:50.989 --> 36:52.423
Get us close, okay?

36:54.276 --> 36:55.526
Danny, you ready?

36:55.611 --> 36:56.944
No.

36:56.995 --> 36:58.496
Good. Come on.

37:43.692 --> 37:46.043
Wo Fat's not here.

37:56.037 --> 37:57.705
Well, he can't be far away.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.778
Huh? Wo Fat--
where is he?

38:03.845 --> 38:04.795
Where's Wo Fat?

38:04.863 --> 38:08.048
I don't know. I don't know!

38:09.434 --> 38:11.051
Book him, Danno.

38:11.103 --> 38:12.503
Come on.

38:20.362 --> 38:22.730
Look, I told you,

38:22.781 --> 38:25.399
I don't know
where Wo Fat is.

38:25.450 --> 38:27.401
I don't believe you.

38:27.452 --> 38:29.403
Come on. Come on.
What are you scared of?

38:29.454 --> 38:30.571
Hmm?

38:30.622 --> 38:32.340
What do you think?

38:32.407 --> 38:34.091
I don't know.
That's why I asked.

38:38.380 --> 38:41.081
We were supposed to take
his money to the Big Island,

38:41.133 --> 38:42.717
meet him there.

38:42.768 --> 38:44.852
That's all I know.

38:48.640 --> 38:50.358
You know what?

38:51.393 --> 38:53.093
I believe you.

38:54.229 --> 38:55.563
I understand.

38:55.614 --> 38:57.214
Oh, you do?

38:58.317 --> 38:59.784
Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

39:01.787 --> 39:02.987
You heard the man.

39:03.071 --> 39:04.438
He doesn't know
anything.

39:04.489 --> 39:05.906
Off you go.
You're free to go.

39:05.957 --> 39:07.408
Go.

39:08.443 --> 39:10.611
Go. Go, go, go.

39:13.332 --> 39:15.949
That's good.
He's a... a dead person now.

39:16.001 --> 39:18.952
If you want to catch a shark,
you got to chum the waters.

39:19.004 --> 39:21.205
Oh, that... that's the bait?

39:21.273 --> 39:22.790
Uh, yeah, he's the bait.

39:23.958 --> 39:25.292
What are you looking
at me like that for?

39:25.344 --> 39:26.410
You got a better idea?

39:27.462 --> 39:28.962
Didn't think so.

39:36.121 --> 39:38.272
Five-O back in business.

39:38.323 --> 39:39.690
For some of us.

39:39.758 --> 39:41.726
Hey, you can't sweat this,
cuz, all right?

39:41.793 --> 39:44.228
My guess is you're back on duty
inside a couple of weeks.

39:44.296 --> 39:46.781
Yeah, and in the
meantime, there's no law

39:46.832 --> 39:49.784
that says you can't grab
a beer with friends, right?

39:49.835 --> 39:51.702
Yeah. I mean...

39:51.787 --> 39:53.987
I mean, I kind of do enjoy
not going to work.

39:54.039 --> 39:57.258
Get to surf every day
for as long as I want.

39:57.325 --> 39:59.427
I haven't been on a
board in 25 years.

39:59.494 --> 40:01.245
Well, why don't you
come out with me?

40:01.313 --> 40:03.714
I mean, I got the boards
and plenty of free time.

40:03.799 --> 40:04.765
You know what?
Don't get

40:04.833 --> 40:06.717
too used to all that
free time, all right?

40:06.802 --> 40:08.335
We may need somebody
in an unofficial

40:08.387 --> 40:10.071
advisory capacity

40:10.138 --> 40:12.273
or maybe for a little
undercover work here and there.

40:12.340 --> 40:14.258
I didn't hear that.

40:14.326 --> 40:15.910
If you're looking for work,

40:15.977 --> 40:18.345
I could use a pretty hostess
at my new shrimp truck.

40:18.397 --> 40:19.346
Really?

40:19.414 --> 40:21.065
I'm allergic to shrimp.

40:21.133 --> 40:22.983
You got to try
my shrimp-flavored tofu.

40:23.034 --> 40:24.935
Mmm.
That sounds disgusting.

40:25.003 --> 40:26.904
You just lost a job.

40:29.541 --> 40:32.159
Hey.

40:33.528 --> 40:35.212
Thank you.

40:36.248 --> 40:38.132
Don't thank me.

40:38.199 --> 40:39.884
Thank your old man.

40:39.968 --> 40:42.052
If it wasn't
for his investigation,

40:42.137 --> 40:43.671
you'd still be in jail
right now.

40:47.509 --> 40:49.810
Heard about Rachel.

40:49.878 --> 40:51.879
Is he going
to be okay?

41:00.539 --> 41:01.772
Hey.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.224
You're already
behind, partner.

41:04.276 --> 41:06.177
Drink up.
What are you doing?

41:07.662 --> 41:11.449
Um, I was going through the rest
of the surveillance footage,

41:11.533 --> 41:13.467
and I... I found this.

41:13.535 --> 41:15.820
This is a meeting

41:15.887 --> 41:18.823
between Wo Fat
and Governor Jameson...

41:18.890 --> 41:21.241
and your old man.

41:22.677 --> 41:24.161
Uh, audio's
all been erased.

41:24.229 --> 41:26.246
That's all
we got.

41:31.970 --> 41:33.637
Maybe... maybe Wo Fat was right.

41:33.722 --> 41:35.222
Maybe my father was dirty.

41:35.273 --> 41:38.142
Well, we don't know
what this is, okay?

41:38.226 --> 41:40.394
This could have been part
of your father's investigation.

41:41.763 --> 41:43.147
Everything all right?

41:51.606 --> 41:53.240
No.

41:53.291 --> 41:54.909
We need to talk to Victor Hesse.

41:55.994 --> 41:57.945
Whatever deal Wo Fat
is making with my father,

41:57.996 --> 41:59.630
he might know
something about it.
