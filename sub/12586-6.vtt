00:35.535 --> 00:37.620
Oh, look at Hank Hill concentrate.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.456
His mind, a total blank.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.250
He is in a state of redneck transcendence.

00:42.333 --> 00:46.254
Such a shame someone with so much
discipline not have more ambition.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.339


00:48.423 --> 00:49.758


00:49.841 --> 00:52.010
-Firm but with little give.

00:52.093 --> 00:54.512
Yup, these are medium-rare.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.098
What if somebody wants theirs well done?

00:57.182 --> 00:58.683
-We ask them politely...

00:58.767 --> 01:00.185
...yet firmly to leave.

01:00.268 --> 01:03.354
With great meat, son,
comes great responsibility.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.314
-

01:04.397 --> 01:06.357
Dig in, everybody!

01:06.441 --> 01:08.193
-All right! It's about time!
All right!

01:08.276 --> 01:09.986
This is gonna be delicious!

01:10.070 --> 01:11.988
I only wish I had as many stomachs

01:12.072 --> 01:14.324
-as the animal I'm about to consume.

01:14.407 --> 01:15.909
-

01:15.992 --> 01:18.036
-
I can't tell if I'm starving

01:18.244 --> 01:19.496
or not hungry at all.

01:19.579 --> 01:20.830
Guess we'll see.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.416


01:23.500 --> 01:25.001


01:25.126 --> 01:26.252


01:26.336 --> 01:27.754
What the...

01:27.837 --> 01:29.214
Peggy, how's your steak?

01:29.297 --> 01:30.882


01:30.965 --> 01:32.300
It's good.

01:32.383 --> 01:33.426
Not too tough?

01:35.678 --> 01:37.514
Bill, your steak? How is it?

01:38.014 --> 01:39.265
-

01:39.349 --> 01:40.850
Mm-hm.

02:03.957 --> 02:04.874
Can I help you?

02:04.958 --> 02:06.126
Well, I hope so.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.961
I bought some steaks here yesterday

02:08.128 --> 02:09.796
and they weren't very good.

02:09.879 --> 02:11.005
Maybe you cooked them wrong.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.301
You don't know me.
So I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.846
I'm gonna have to ask to talk
to the head butcher.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.597
We don't actually have a butcher anymore.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.266
Our meat comes pre-wrapped.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.308
Dangit!

02:22.392 --> 02:23.935
I just want a good steak.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.771
You could try our organic line,
Mega-Lo Organic.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.898
But I think that's just the same stuff
with a different label.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.400
Psst.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.778
Dude, if you're looking for good meat,
I can hook you up.

02:33.862 --> 02:34.988
Appleseed?

02:35.905 --> 02:38.283
-How do you know my name?
-It's me, Hank.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.200
Ah.

02:39.284 --> 02:43.621
We spent a week together in the woods.
You lived in my neighbor's house.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.373
Woods?

02:45.456 --> 02:46.749
Neighbors?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.293
That does sound like me.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.628
You got to shop at the co-op, Hank.

02:50.712 --> 02:54.591
All their meat is organic, grass-fed,
and prime.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.384
It's on the corner of Route Two and Vista.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.677
Co-op, huh?

02:57.760 --> 03:02.348
All those VW's in the parking lot,
I just assumed it was a Unitarian Church.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.153
Uh, I'm looking for your meat department.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.113
Make a left at the goji berries.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.073
If you reach the spelt,
you've gone too far.

03:20.074 --> 03:21.618
This had better be good steak.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.627
It's beautiful.

03:31.794 --> 03:34.047
When you see something you like,
let me know.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.882
I'll cut it as thick as you want.

03:35.965 --> 03:39.469
Sir, if it wasn't covered in blood,
I'd shake your hand.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.595
I'll take four--

03:40.678 --> 03:42.513
I'm afraid we can't sell you that.

03:43.097 --> 03:45.600
-What?
-Steve Green, co-op founder.

03:45.683 --> 03:48.311
Hank Hill, paying customer.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.396
You have to be a member
to shop here, Hank.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.314
Really?

03:51.397 --> 03:53.107
I'm a member of Triple A.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.609
That doesn't help.

03:54.692 --> 03:55.652
Are you sure?

03:55.735 --> 03:57.654
It's opened up a lot of doors in the past.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.989
You see, Hank, we're a non-profit.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.576
All of our members are co-owners
and are required to pay a small fee.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.204
You also have to volunteer here
a few hours a month.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.715
You got me over a barrel, Steve.

04:18.424 --> 04:19.717
Okay, I'll join.

04:19.801 --> 04:23.096
Great! I'll get an application.
It'll take a few days to process.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.973
The guy who does that is
on a vision quest!

04:28.268 --> 04:29.143
Appleseed?

04:30.561 --> 04:31.562
Uh.

04:31.813 --> 04:32.981
I need your help.

04:33.064 --> 04:37.735
I want to get some meat
but I don't have the proper ID.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.326
Hey, Hank.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.245
I got the meat. Shh.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.289
I got some other stuff too.

04:49.372 --> 04:53.918
Heirloom tomatoes, organic carrots,
and some hemp toilet paper.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.628
Are you trying to frame me?

05:08.891 --> 05:10.560
-
Well, it cuts good.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.437
Consistent grain pattern.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.688
Well, here goes.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.943
So, is it good?

05:19.027 --> 05:21.029
The suspense is killing me!

05:21.112 --> 05:24.407
It's the best steak I have ever eaten.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.784
Peggy, I think we need to say grace again.

05:28.870 --> 05:29.787
Mm!

05:29.871 --> 05:32.165
These potatoes are great.

05:32.248 --> 05:35.918
The tot is no longer
my favorite kind of tater.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.466
And this tomato is delicious too!

05:41.549 --> 05:43.343
This is a tomato?

05:43.426 --> 05:45.428
I thought it was a heaven ball.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.096
You two aren't making any sense.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.307
Tomatoes don't have any flavor.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.059
Hmm.

05:51.142 --> 05:54.854
Hank, if this is food,
what have we been eating?

05:57.148 --> 05:58.274
Welcome back, Hank.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.234
Appleseed needs a hand in back.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.487
Our other stock person didn't show up.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.198
He had a good excuse though. He flaked.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.245
Well, I usually reserve this compliment
for my wife.

06:11.329 --> 06:14.207
But this food is downright handsome.

06:14.290 --> 06:17.001
All these berries need to go out
to the produce section.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.628
Guess we should get to work.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.713
You're only taking one pint at a time?

06:20.797 --> 06:22.924
Right.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.550
I've got two hands, don't I?

06:26.677 --> 06:28.888
We should stack the boxes
on that handtruck.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.681
That way, it'll only take a couple trips.

06:30.765 --> 06:34.310
And one of us could be doing that
while the other one can stack the display.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.481
Hank, I think you might be "the one."

06:43.611 --> 06:45.029
Well, that's the last of them.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.158
What on earth is Sunshine doing?

06:49.242 --> 06:51.494
An interpretive dance
to entertain people waiting in line.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.540
You know, if you want people
to get through the line faster,

06:55.623 --> 06:57.417
we could open up a second register.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.502
Wow!

07:01.295 --> 07:05.049
Can anyone here operate
a hydraulic power loader?

07:07.969 --> 07:09.470
Uh, oh...

07:09.554 --> 07:11.305
Am I really the only one?

07:11.389 --> 07:12.223
We need to pick up...

07:12.306 --> 07:13.766
...some produce from our farm.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.727
Don't take any steep hills.
The truck runs on vegetable oil.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.990
Manure.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.412
You're from the co-op?

07:34.662 --> 07:36.122
Yes, sir. Hank Hill.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.500
So this is where my dinner came from.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.503
These animals live better than
most people I know.

07:42.587 --> 07:46.466
Yup. See, the steaks you buy at a grocery
store come from penned-up steer.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.927
They feed them antibiotics
and little bits of other cows.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.262
And that makes them unhappy.

07:51.345 --> 07:52.805
That would make me unhappy.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.849
And it makes them taste terrible.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.267
Boy, it sure does!

07:56.350 --> 07:58.769
Our steers get to roam around
in the sunshine.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.189
They drink fresh water
from that stream over there.

08:01.272 --> 08:04.275
Trust me. The happier the steer,
the better they taste.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.819
They all look delicious.

08:09.822 --> 08:14.035
You sure have been spending a lot of time
with your new hippie friends, Hank.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.496
Tell me, are you wearing
tie-dye underwear?

08:16.579 --> 08:18.539
Are you wearing any underwear at all?

08:18.623 --> 08:20.833
Guys, I am not now,

08:20.917 --> 08:23.127
nor will I ever be, a hippie.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.754
I don't trust hippies.

08:24.837 --> 08:28.966
They talk about free love, but when it
comes time to get down to business,

08:29.050 --> 08:30.593
they've always got an excuse.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.844
Okay, that's enough.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.888
The people at the co-op are okay.

08:33.971 --> 08:37.183
Sure they dress a little funny
and the puns about food

08:37.266 --> 08:42.396
get a little tiring, "peanut better,
fakin' bacon, turkey burger,"

08:42.480 --> 08:43.981
but they sell good food.

08:44.065 --> 08:44.982
Leave them alone.

08:46.901 --> 08:50.571
So do they start every day
with a drum circle?

08:52.782 --> 08:53.991
I don't want to talk about it.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.914
And that's how you rotate stock.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.167
Steve, something's wrong.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.002
What is it? Are you having flashbacks?

09:05.086 --> 09:07.255
Because I am real.

09:07.421 --> 09:08.756
It's the register.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.216
I think it's broken.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.179
-Seems fine to me.
-But look.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.598
It's got all that extra money in there.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.518
That doesn't make sense.
We already paid all the suppliers.

09:20.601 --> 09:23.521
Well, then I guess that extra money
is profit.

09:23.604 --> 09:24.855
Pro... Profit!

09:24.939 --> 09:27.191
-No!
-I touched it!

09:27.275 --> 09:28.359
What?

09:28.442 --> 09:30.236
I don't understand the problem here.

09:30.319 --> 09:33.698
Hank, we're a non-profit.
We need to sort this out.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.741
Appleseed, lock the doors.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.377
We've never made money before!

09:46.460 --> 09:47.837
What do we do?

09:47.920 --> 09:50.006
I got it. Let's break all the windows
in the store.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.966
We'll need to use the profit to fix them.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.676
Problem solved, man.

09:53.759 --> 09:57.263
-No, wait. What are you doing?
-Being part of the solution.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.765
She's right.
I've seen what money does to people!

09:59.849 --> 10:02.184
Pretty soon we'll all be flying around
in helicopters

10:02.268 --> 10:04.186
and getting 30-dollar haircuts!

10:04.270 --> 10:05.521
Guys, profit doesn't have

10:05.605 --> 10:07.064
to be a bad thing.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.234
You don't have to use the money
to improve your lives.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.486
We can use it to improve the store.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.571
How's that?

10:13.654 --> 10:15.823
Well, most of our carts
have broken wheels.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.534
We could fix them.
And maybe we could get a better sign.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.494
Something people can see from the road.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.623
Yeah, man! Random acts of kindness!

10:23.706 --> 10:25.333
No, not at all.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.002
And we could stop charging
a membership fee.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.631
That way we'll be helping more people
get access to good food.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.636
How heavy is your head, Hank?

10:39.138 --> 10:41.557
You want a burrito
from the lunch truck, honey?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.392
No, thanks. I packed a sandwich.

10:46.771 --> 10:47.980
Looks fancy.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.191
You got to go to Hollywood
for that sandwich, Hank?

10:50.274 --> 10:52.443
Or does Erik Estrada deliver it for you?

10:56.280 --> 10:57.531
You got a phone call.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.369
Hello?

11:01.452 --> 11:02.912
Appleseed, I can't come

11:02.995 --> 11:04.372
to the co-op right now. I...

11:05.623 --> 11:07.333
Okay, I'm on my way.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.924
What's going on?
I had to take a third of a personal day.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.008
Check out the guy

11:16.092 --> 11:17.593
by the wheat-free pastas.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.222
Is he shoplifting?

11:21.305 --> 11:22.515
It's worse than that.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.768
Look at him, with his fancy phone
and his pleats.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.270
People like him have been coming
in all day.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.023
-So?
-They're ruining the vibe, Hank.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.776
Yeah, Hank. The vibe's shot to hell!

11:33.943 --> 11:36.070
Guys, I was at work.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.448
We opened the door
and the Establishment marched right in!

11:39.532 --> 11:41.534
We need to get these yuppies out of here!

11:41.617 --> 11:44.620
What? No!
That's not how you run a business.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.831
You can't just sell to people you like!

11:46.914 --> 11:48.666
His shoes have tassels!

11:48.749 --> 11:50.418
I don't like him any more than you do.

11:50.501 --> 11:53.129
But when I look at that guy,
I don't see tassels.

11:53.212 --> 11:56.132
I see someone who's tired
of eating industrialized,

11:56.215 --> 11:57.967
tasteless meat and produce.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.969
That's what makes this co-op special.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.597
How could I be so intolerant?

12:03.681 --> 12:07.977
Don't look now, Hank,
but you just fixed our vibe.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.311
Ting!

12:12.606 --> 12:14.066
This is so cool!

12:14.150 --> 12:16.569
How do you know when a cow is ripe?

12:16.652 --> 12:18.195
Do you squeeze it?

12:18.279 --> 12:19.363
You don't want to do anything...

12:19.447 --> 12:20.614
...to upset them, Bobby.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.699
Just talk to them.

12:21.782 --> 12:24.618
To them, our conversation
is like tenderizer.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.830
You know, since we're here,
I'm gonna go pick more of those peaches.

12:27.913 --> 12:32.001
That last batch was so juicy,
I had to eat over a bucket!

12:32.084 --> 12:33.711
Then I drank from the bucket

12:33.878 --> 12:35.838
and giggled like a schoolgirl!

12:37.715 --> 12:38.716
Good morning, Hank.

12:38.799 --> 12:42.094
Say goodbye to Victor over there.
I'm taking him to the slaughterhouse.

12:42.178 --> 12:46.098
Well, okay. But it's not so much goodbye
as it is "see you later."

12:51.020 --> 12:52.021
Dee-licious!

12:52.104 --> 12:56.108
Hank, this steak's so tender, it's like
somebody already chewed it for me!

12:56.192 --> 12:58.194
Here's my indecent proposal.

12:58.277 --> 13:03.365
I spend one night with wrinkly Robert
Redford for one million ears of corn.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.452
I don't like eating corn
without corn holders.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.747
Oh, wait! These are corn holders!

13:10.790 --> 13:12.458
I've got potato salad!

13:12.541 --> 13:14.293
And I've got a mouth!

13:15.336 --> 13:16.587
Hank! Hank!

13:18.506 --> 13:20.257
Appleseed, what are you doing here?

13:20.341 --> 13:21.675
There's trouble at the co-op.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.761
It's Mega-Lo Mart.
They're trying to buy us out!

13:23.844 --> 13:25.387
What? No!

13:25.471 --> 13:26.889
Wow!

13:26.972 --> 13:29.308
He's like a human version of Lassie.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.313
They want to buy the store.
The farm, the trucks, everything.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.981
And they want an answer by tomorrow.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.691
Well, we don't want to wait until then.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.401
Call them now and say no.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.990
Yeah, we're, we're thinking
we're gonna sell, Hank.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.409
-What?
-It's a pretty generous offer.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.495
And as co-owners, we all get a cut.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.330
I'm gonna give my money to good causes.

13:51.413 --> 13:54.041
People who plant trees
and set fire to SUVs.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.210
But Mega-Lo Mart'll ruin this place.

13:56.293 --> 14:00.089
They're not gonna take the time to feed
the cows alfalfa if they're tummies ache,

14:00.214 --> 14:03.676
or sift through the cows' scat
for signs of trouble.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.720
Or massage the steer
to keep the flanks supple.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.305
Mega-Lo Mart's too big.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.723
Maybe their size will help!

14:09.807 --> 14:13.644
Like you said, Hank,
"more good food for more people."

14:13.727 --> 14:15.229
Well, I want no part of it.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.565
And neither does Appleseed.
Right, Appleseed?

14:18.607 --> 14:21.193
I, need new shoes, Hank.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.946
I thought we all cared about this place.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.032
I guess I'm the only one.

14:33.330 --> 14:37.418
If I believed in karma,
I'd be really worried about you guys.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.635
I can't taste anything!

14:46.719 --> 14:49.680
I feel like I'm eating
with a mitten on my tongue.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.684
I guess there are some things
even Mrs. Dash can't fix.

14:54.685 --> 14:58.272
Let's just focus on the task at hand
and push through this.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.815
Your father is right.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.276
We will forget what food tastes like
soon enough.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.697
Maybe it would help if we ate
in front of the TV.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.783
Dad, that guy's back.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.327
Hank, Hank, you were right

15:11.410 --> 15:12.661
about Mega-Lo Organic.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.204
But it's worse than you thought.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.289
What are you talking about?

15:15.372 --> 15:18.375
It's just as industrialized
as the rest of Mega-Lo Mart.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.628
I saw pictures on the Internet
of where they keep their cows.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.338
They're like prison cells.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.423
Being a cow isn't a crime.

15:24.506 --> 15:25.758
We got to talk to Steve!

15:26.759 --> 15:28.802
Appleseed, I was in the middle
of eating my...

15:30.346 --> 15:31.180
I'll drive.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.228
What have they done to this place?

15:40.272 --> 15:42.024
No! The meat too!

15:42.107 --> 15:44.568
It doesn't look like it was ever alive.

15:45.152 --> 15:48.739
Steve, we have to do something.
Mega-Lo Mart is ruining this place.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.492
And you should see the conditions
their cows are living in.

15:51.575 --> 15:53.911
Look, it's not the way I'd run things.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.704
But it's still technically organic.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.123
Well, it might be organic but it's awful.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.042
How does Sal feel about this?

16:00.834 --> 16:02.252
We don't have a butcher anymore.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.381
Sal took his profits and bought a condo
on a cruise ship you can live on.

16:07.716 --> 16:08.676
How cute!

16:08.759 --> 16:12.096
My new phone reminded me
I have a dentist appointment.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.639
Thank you, phone.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.642
We can't stand for this.

16:16.725 --> 16:19.186
You're right.
We should make signs and protest

16:19.269 --> 16:21.146
and ask people to sign a petition.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.439
No, Appleseed.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.608
We're gonna do something
that makes a difference.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.533
I'll get the cattle
and put them in the trailer.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.743
Should I steal the plants?

16:34.827 --> 16:35.869
We're not stealing.

16:35.953 --> 16:40.374
We're co-owners of this farm and we're not
taking any profits from this sale.

16:40.457 --> 16:43.168
We're just taking what's ours,
our fair share.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.796
Then why are we doing it at night...

16:46.797 --> 16:48.507
...and why did you drive
with your headlights off?

16:48.590 --> 16:50.884
Just go grab a couple chickens.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.594
Right.

16:52.678 --> 16:53.804
It's okay.

16:53.887 --> 16:54.847
It's me, Hank.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.396
<i>♪ Well, we fired our guns</i>
<i>And the British kept a-coming ♪</i>

17:02.479 --> 17:04.273
<i>♪ There wasn't nigh as many ♪</i>

17:04.356 --> 17:06.150

17:06.233 --> 17:08.444

17:11.280 --> 17:12.281
Hank?

17:14.616 --> 17:15.784
Cows!

17:15.868 --> 17:17.077
Thank you, Dad!

17:17.161 --> 17:19.705
Can I draw the meat parts on them
with a Sharpie?

17:19.788 --> 17:21.123
Hank, are you crazy?

17:21.206 --> 17:23.751
We cannot have livestock in our backyard?

17:23.834 --> 17:25.169
I'm not even sure it's legal.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.296
We can't possibly be zoned for this.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.133
I don't care, Peggy.

17:31.216 --> 17:35.095
I'll turn the shed into a chicken coop
and use the garage as a barn.

17:35.179 --> 17:39.058
If we give the cows some private time,
soon we should have a hundred head.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.225
Hundred head?

17:40.309 --> 17:43.937
We barely have enough room back here
for a proper game of badminton, Hank.

17:44.021 --> 17:47.858
Well, we'll have to knock down the fence
to Dale's yard so they can graze.

17:47.941 --> 17:50.694
And we'll need to find a butcher
who can keep a secret.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.154
You've lost your mind.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.531
Maybe we can keep a chicken, maybe.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.200
Come on, Peggy, please?

17:56.283 --> 17:57.493
I'll let you name them.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.370
You've got all those great names
you've been waiting to use.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.791
Okay. Let's give it a try.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.716
Guys, stop trying to tip my cow.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.760
Your mission is futile, Hank Hill.

18:14.843 --> 18:19.723
Even if you block view, I still have
better house, a better car, better wife.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.558
Oh, face it, I just better.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.603
What the heck was that?

18:24.686 --> 18:25.646
You got a cow?

18:25.729 --> 18:27.189
Uh, a cow?

18:27.272 --> 18:30.109
Why would I have a cow
in my backyard, Kahn?

18:30.192 --> 18:31.360
I don't know.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.278
Why does Bill use t-shirt
as car-seat cover?

18:33.362 --> 18:35.280
Why do rednecks do anything?

18:36.990 --> 18:40.035
-Sure smell like cow.
-Yes. Well, you see, that's...

18:40.119 --> 18:42.329
Oh, that's me! I smell like cow.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.084
Okay, yeah. I guess you do.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.588
That's right. Yeah.
Two hundred pounds of cattle feed.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.592
Yes. That's the correct address.
It's a residence.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.054
Are you selling feed
or are you asking questions?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.764
Tomorrow morning, we find out

19:00.848 --> 19:05.227
if a "Martha" tastes different
from a "Mrs. Peckingham."

19:07.646 --> 19:09.273
Cows! I knew it!

19:09.356 --> 19:10.607
Oh, Lord!

19:15.320 --> 19:17.281
Look what these cows did to my yard!

19:17.364 --> 19:20.325
I'll fix it, Kahn.
I'll take care of everything.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.162
You got chickens too?

19:23.245 --> 19:24.454
I reporting you!

19:24.538 --> 19:25.873
No, wait!

19:26.874 --> 19:28.584
Do you like good meat, Kahn?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.127
You trying to buy me off, Hank Hill?

19:30.210 --> 19:32.421
No way! I'm calling cops!

19:33.463 --> 19:34.548
Well, you go ahead!

19:34.631 --> 19:37.342
I've got nothing to fear.
I've done nothing wrong!

19:41.138 --> 19:42.973
Appleseed, get over here quick!

19:47.227 --> 19:48.562
Kahn called the police.

19:48.645 --> 19:49.479
They'll be here soon.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.523
You've got
to get these cattle out of here.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.108
But where should I go?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.277
Someplace where no one will find you.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.321
Find a field where they can graze.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.448
Find a stream where they can drink.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.492
It's the only way to keep our dream alive.

20:02.576 --> 20:05.037
Go. And write me when you think it's safe.

20:06.246 --> 20:09.166
-I'm scared, Hank.
-There's no time to waste.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.709
Go on now. Git.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.426
Run, Appleseed, run!

20:45.744 --> 20:48.789
Well, at least our tomato crop
has started to come in.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.332
Yeah. That's something.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.106
Delicious.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.398
-<i>It's the best steak
I have ever eaten.</i>
