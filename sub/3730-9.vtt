00:00.332 --> 00:01.300
<i>Previously on "The Whispers..."</i>

00:01.377 --> 00:04.854
Drill, I want you to leave my daughter
alone. I'll do whatever it takes.

00:05.130 --> 00:08.583
Drill says if you do what the letters
say, he'll give you what you want.

00:08.667 --> 00:11.169
Drill's been here before, back in 1982.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.387
My son Thomas, he killed his brother.

00:13.505 --> 00:15.006
Said Drill made him do it.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.224
Thomas, we are here

00:16.341 --> 00:17.391
because we want to help our son.

00:17.509 --> 00:19.427
They must have sent another one.

00:19.511 --> 00:21.178
He can't be the same friend I had!

00:21.263 --> 00:22.897
- Why not, Thomas?
- Because I killed him!

00:23.015 --> 00:24.482
[Door opens]

00:24.566 --> 00:25.933
No!

00:26.018 --> 00:27.068
Thomas.

00:27.185 --> 00:29.186
He knows how to kill Drill.

00:35.010 --> 00:36.827
[Thunder rumbles]

00:36.912 --> 00:38.162
Thomas!

00:38.263 --> 00:39.263
Eliot!

00:39.314 --> 00:41.432
Where are you?!

00:44.970 --> 00:46.737
Eliot!

00:46.838 --> 00:48.372
Thomas!

00:50.008 --> 00:53.477
[Thunder rumbles]

00:53.578 --> 00:54.895
Thomas!

00:54.980 --> 00:57.081
[Breathing heavily] Okay.

00:57.132 --> 00:59.700
Where's Eliot?

01:01.887 --> 01:03.354
Where's all this blood coming from?!

01:03.421 --> 01:04.355
[Thunder rumbles]

01:04.422 --> 01:06.073
Thomas!

01:06.191 --> 01:07.358
He made me do it, daddy!

01:07.459 --> 01:08.626
I had to!

01:08.727 --> 01:10.127
I had to!

01:10.228 --> 01:11.929
Eliot!

01:12.030 --> 01:13.097
Eliot!

01:13.164 --> 01:15.299
Man: We have a gunshot wound here!

01:22.207 --> 01:23.407
Thank you.

01:23.475 --> 01:24.558
You didn't give me much
detail on the phone.

01:24.643 --> 01:25.793
I know.

01:25.910 --> 01:27.177
What is he doing here?

01:27.278 --> 01:28.279
Security!

01:28.346 --> 01:29.747
I can explain... stay away from me.

01:29.749 --> 01:32.316
It's okay, Dr. Benavidez,
he is no longer a threat.

01:32.350 --> 01:34.017
He knows who he is.
His name is Sean Bennigan.

01:34.102 --> 01:35.252
He is my husband.

01:36.788 --> 01:38.389
Your... your husband is...

01:38.456 --> 01:39.640
yes. I know, we have a lot
of explaining to do,

01:39.724 --> 01:42.392
but right now, that man
we brought in here, please...

01:42.494 --> 01:45.095
Please. You can't let him die.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.901
Jessup: Thanks, Frank.
I appreciate you trying.

01:50.985 --> 01:52.236
It's too late.

01:52.287 --> 01:54.771
One of the neighbors already
called in the gunshots.

01:54.856 --> 01:57.574
My contact at the bureau
wasn't able to bury it.

01:57.642 --> 01:58.775
So, what does that mean?

01:58.810 --> 02:00.944
Local policemen start canvassing
the hospitals.

02:00.946 --> 02:03.447
It's only a matter of time
before they get here.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.382
Lena: Wes, I shot a man.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.818
You were protecting Minx.
It's what I would have done.

02:07.886 --> 02:09.586
It's what any parent would have done.

02:09.654 --> 02:11.038
But I didn't protect her.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.523
And now I'm sitting here
half-hoping that man might die.

02:13.608 --> 02:15.292
What kind of a person does that?

02:15.376 --> 02:16.693
Okay, okay.

02:21.466 --> 02:23.500
Maria: We were able to stabilize him.

02:23.584 --> 02:25.335
Claire: So he's gonna make it?

02:25.436 --> 02:26.903
It's too early to say.

02:27.004 --> 02:28.638
He's lost a lot of blood.

02:28.723 --> 02:29.906
When can we speak to him?

02:29.957 --> 02:31.174
He's still unconscious.

02:31.242 --> 02:34.711
We don't know when he's going to come out.

02:35.763 --> 02:36.813
Wes.

02:41.035 --> 02:44.838
Do not tell Minx what I did.

02:44.872 --> 02:48.408
Tell her my mom's sick.
Tell her anything but the truth.

02:48.492 --> 02:50.176
Officers, it's me you want to speak to.

02:50.261 --> 02:51.311
What? Wes.

02:51.395 --> 02:52.996
I will take care of this.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.066
No. There are favors I can call in, okay?

02:56.200 --> 02:57.834
Officer: Sir, come with me.

02:57.902 --> 02:59.519
Wait. I want to escort my husband.

02:59.604 --> 03:01.838
Ma'am, we can't let you ride in
the car with him.

03:01.872 --> 03:03.440
I'm not leaving him.

03:03.541 --> 03:05.125
Fine.

03:05.209 --> 03:06.476
You take her.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.848
[Sighs]

03:11.916 --> 03:13.817
What do we do? I can't...

03:13.851 --> 03:15.018
I can't just sit here doing nothing,

03:15.119 --> 03:16.686
praying for Thomas to recover.

03:16.721 --> 03:18.571
- What choice do we have?
- We can keep looking.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.690
He may be the only one
who knows how to kill Drill,

03:20.725 --> 03:22.625
but that doesn't mean
that he kept it to himself.

03:22.710 --> 03:23.960
His house, he... he might have

03:24.028 --> 03:25.695
written it down somewhere, kept a journal.

03:25.763 --> 03:27.197
We can't leave him here unprotected.

03:27.264 --> 03:28.364
Jessup: He won't be.

03:28.449 --> 03:29.749
I'll stay.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.018
Besides, this is the last place
either one of you should be.

03:32.102 --> 03:33.870
The police found us,
so you can be damn sure

03:33.938 --> 03:35.605
Frommer's men will be sniffing around, too.

03:35.689 --> 03:37.707
He's right. We need to keep moving.

03:39.310 --> 03:40.360
Jessup.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.178
The minute Thomas wakes up, I'll call you.

03:42.213 --> 03:43.646
You have my word.

03:48.018 --> 03:49.736
Hey.

03:49.820 --> 03:50.820
Hey. What is it?

03:50.954 --> 03:52.055
It's just Thomas.

03:52.089 --> 03:54.490
We led Drill right to him.

03:54.525 --> 03:57.260
Everything he's been through...

03:57.311 --> 03:59.028
- He doesn't deserve that.
- [Siren chirps]

03:59.113 --> 04:02.015
[Tires screech]

04:09.623 --> 04:11.557
[Indistinct talking]

04:14.194 --> 04:15.344
Wes!

04:15.429 --> 04:16.678
Lena?

04:16.730 --> 04:17.697
Open this door!

04:17.815 --> 04:19.115
Lena!

04:19.199 --> 04:20.315
Lena, it's gonna be okay!

04:20.384 --> 04:21.684
Lena! Wes?

04:21.718 --> 04:24.620
Get your hands off me!
Lena, I will take care of this!

04:24.755 --> 04:26.556
What's going on here?

04:26.640 --> 04:28.524
Explain to me what is going on here.

04:28.609 --> 04:29.809
It's okay!

05:02.005 --> 05:03.372
Jessup: First we need to remove

05:03.456 --> 05:04.957
all electrical devices from the room.

05:05.074 --> 05:07.326
He has to be monitored.
He needs his medications.

05:07.410 --> 05:09.545
Then we've got to do it
the old-fashioned way.

05:09.629 --> 05:11.246
I'm pretty sure we had hospitals

05:11.347 --> 05:12.915
before we had all these machines.

05:13.049 --> 05:16.301
Then how about you tell me
what's really going on?

05:16.419 --> 05:19.304
Until then, I am not breaking
hospital protocol

05:19.422 --> 05:21.423
or risking my patient's life.

05:26.512 --> 05:27.896
You said it yourself,

05:27.981 --> 05:30.649
back at the nuclear power plant.

05:30.767 --> 05:32.351
What's happening only makes sense

05:32.435 --> 05:34.436
if you're willing to admit the impossible.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.772
And you know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

05:39.943 --> 05:41.877
Thomas Harcourt may be the only person

05:41.978 --> 05:44.363
who knows how to get rid of...
Whatever is here.

05:44.447 --> 05:46.281
If he dies...

05:51.921 --> 05:54.289
What else do we need to do?

05:54.373 --> 05:57.042
Clear this wing of all
patients and personnel.

05:57.126 --> 05:58.960
Okay.

05:59.095 --> 06:00.879
There's one last thing.

06:00.963 --> 06:04.182
I need to see your children's ward.

06:06.552 --> 06:08.970
The three of you certainly
know how to cause trouble.

06:09.105 --> 06:10.555
I have to give you that.

06:10.640 --> 06:11.973
Sir... no, it's one thing

06:12.058 --> 06:13.725
to pull rank on a full local cops.

06:13.809 --> 06:15.644
It's another thing to keep them quiet

06:15.728 --> 06:17.362
once they find out what the hell
you people have been up to.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.530
I can explain.

06:18.648 --> 06:19.981
Oh, that's exactly what I'm afraid of.

06:20.066 --> 06:25.537
Can't have you out there saying
God knows what to God knows who.

06:25.655 --> 06:27.038
Mrs. Bennigan,

06:27.156 --> 06:30.325
I would say it's a pleasure to
finally make your acquaintance,

06:30.409 --> 06:32.160
but we both know I'd be lying.

06:33.496 --> 06:34.746
Likewise, sir.

06:34.830 --> 06:36.498
I understand you're upset about your son.

06:36.632 --> 06:37.799
But that's over now,

06:37.883 --> 06:39.918
because each of you will be
taken a facility

06:40.002 --> 06:41.903
where you'll be held until further notice.

06:42.004 --> 06:43.722
So you're gonna lock up the only people

06:43.839 --> 06:45.006
who know how to end this?

06:45.141 --> 06:46.174
Excuse me?

06:46.258 --> 06:47.592
We have a lead.

06:47.676 --> 06:49.394
Someone who knows how to destroy Drill.

06:49.512 --> 06:50.562
Mrs. Bennigan...

06:50.679 --> 06:52.430
<i>Agent</i> Bennigan.

06:52.515 --> 06:55.500
Agent Bennigan, this desperate ploy...

06:55.618 --> 06:57.185
you're right.

06:57.319 --> 06:58.953
I am desperate.

06:59.038 --> 07:01.489
I am desperate because...

07:01.574 --> 07:05.893
My child, because all...

07:05.995 --> 07:08.246
all of our children are in this.

07:08.330 --> 07:11.149
And if you think that
I am just gonna sit back

07:11.233 --> 07:13.868
and watch them become casualties, you know,

07:13.953 --> 07:15.937
the truth is that you
wouldn't have any idea

07:16.021 --> 07:18.373
what you were dealing with
if it weren't for us.

07:18.457 --> 07:20.742
You need us.

07:20.826 --> 07:22.794
And you know it.

07:26.782 --> 07:29.050
This lead you all think you have...

07:29.101 --> 07:32.537
Sean: There's a credible witness
that believes the entity

07:32.621 --> 07:34.472
we're dealing with today is
actually a second visitor.

07:34.556 --> 07:37.091
Wes: 1982... he was neutralized

07:37.176 --> 07:39.193
before he could become a threat.

07:39.228 --> 07:41.162
Please do not waste time
making us the enemy.

07:41.196 --> 07:44.098
The real enemy is out there plotting
his next move against all of us.

07:44.183 --> 07:47.068
We do not have time.

07:52.841 --> 07:54.141
24 hours.

07:54.192 --> 07:57.278
And I want updates 'round the clock.

08:08.690 --> 08:10.524
He let us go. What?

08:10.659 --> 08:11.826
What about the shooting?

08:11.910 --> 08:13.244
He's taking care of it.

08:13.362 --> 08:14.912
Just like that?

08:15.030 --> 08:17.081
Well, with guys like him,
nothing is "just like that,"

08:17.199 --> 08:18.916
but it beats the hell out
of the alternative.

08:19.034 --> 08:21.035
I'll have someone drive you home.

08:21.169 --> 08:23.120
Wes, no. You'll be safe, okay?

08:23.205 --> 08:26.006
I'll have thermal cameras
put all over the house.

08:26.091 --> 08:28.459
No, Wes, I am not going into hiding.

08:28.543 --> 08:29.793
This is my fight, too.

08:29.878 --> 08:31.595
Minx needs you, Lena.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.715
What Minx needs is for this to be over.

08:34.850 --> 08:36.049
Please.

08:36.134 --> 08:38.385
Let me do something.

08:38.470 --> 08:40.321
Claire: I know.

08:40.388 --> 08:42.857
Go back to the hospital
and make sure Thomas is safe.

08:42.941 --> 08:44.441
I'll head to his house. Alone?

08:44.559 --> 08:46.227
Lena: Not alone.

08:46.361 --> 08:48.562
Wes and I will take her.

08:51.283 --> 08:53.701
Woman: Good job. [Speaking indistinctly]

08:56.237 --> 08:59.623
So, it looks like we have 14 patients right

08:59.741 --> 09:01.825
the nurses need to make sure each child

09:01.910 --> 09:03.577
is accounted for at all times.

09:03.712 --> 09:06.330
Okay. I'll... I'll go talk to them.

09:22.313 --> 09:23.680
[Woman sobbing]

09:46.829 --> 09:49.464
So, it's just a coincidence that

09:49.531 --> 09:52.200
Frommer's guys nab us
just as we're leaving,

09:52.301 --> 09:55.269
just as you advised us to do?

09:55.370 --> 09:57.605
You know what?

09:57.673 --> 09:59.841
I'm done trying to prove myself to you.

09:59.875 --> 10:01.776
You don't have kids, do you?

10:01.810 --> 10:02.977
No. My wife,

10:03.045 --> 10:04.645
my soon-to-be ex-wife,

10:04.713 --> 10:07.281
said she didn't want to have any.

10:07.349 --> 10:09.984
Funny thing, though. She's pregnant now.

10:10.035 --> 10:11.819
Sorry.

10:14.856 --> 10:16.123
But I get what you're saying.

10:16.191 --> 10:18.359
If it was my kid... Though I suppose

10:18.443 --> 10:20.361
he's somebody's son, too.

10:20.429 --> 10:22.897
He could be lying, you know.

10:22.948 --> 10:24.799
Or crazy.

10:24.866 --> 10:26.834
We can't be sure that he really knows

10:26.868 --> 10:28.602
how to kill Drill.

10:28.637 --> 10:30.321
He's got to know something.

10:30.405 --> 10:33.023
Otherwise, why would Drill be after him?

10:37.779 --> 10:39.630
It's quiet.

10:43.502 --> 10:44.468
Too quiet.

10:44.553 --> 10:47.688
Gonna take a look around.

10:47.789 --> 10:50.724
You good?

10:50.809 --> 10:51.959
Mm.

11:10.078 --> 11:15.983
It's incredible, the amount
of work he put into this.

11:16.034 --> 11:20.454
My dad and I used to make models.

11:20.522 --> 11:22.723
I mean, nothing like this, but...

11:22.774 --> 11:24.925

a completely different person

13:20.608 --> 13:22.575

26:28.516 --> 26:31.168
What if Thomas didn't kill Eliot?

26:31.219 --> 26:33.704
Well, if... if he didn't, then who...

26:33.772 --> 26:35.255
Drill.

26:35.340 --> 26:37.274
Thomas wasn't Drill's only friend.

26:37.309 --> 26:39.076
Drill was talking to Eliot, too.

26:39.127 --> 26:40.728
Remember, Thomas... he said... he said

26:40.812 --> 26:42.246
he refused to send out the signal

26:42.313 --> 26:44.298
because he knew what
would happen if he did, so...

26:44.382 --> 26:45.933
so Drill convinced Eliot
to help him instead.

26:46.017 --> 26:47.484
Oh, I think he did more than convince him.

26:47.535 --> 26:51.321

26:51.406 --> 26:54.424

26:58.213 --> 27:00.747
Yes.
