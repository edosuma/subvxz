00:54.555 --> 00:57.623
       - WHO DOESN'T LOVE
      THANKSGIVING BREAK?

00:57.625 --> 00:59.758
      ME, TORI GILLESPIE.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.729
 OR, AS EVERYONE IN HIGH SCHOOL
       USED TO CALL ME...

01:03.731 --> 01:06.198
  all: WHORIE, WHORIE, WHORIE!

01:06.200 --> 01:08.867
   - THAT NICKNAME WAS MEANT
   TO BE IRONIC, BY THE WAY,

01:08.869 --> 01:11.437
    ALTHOUGH I DID HAVE SEX
     WITH A ZUCCHINI ONCE,

01:11.439 --> 01:13.906
      SO I GUESS THAT WAS
        KIND OF SLUTTY.

01:13.908 --> 01:16.875
        NEEDLESS TO SAY,
  HIGH SCHOOL FUCKING SUCKED.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.111
      BUT HERE'S THE THING
       ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL:

01:19.113 --> 01:21.280
            IT ENDS.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.315
 AND YOU GET TO GO TO COLLEGE,

01:23.317 --> 01:26.251
  WHERE NO ONE KNOWS THAT YOU
   WERE A BED-WETTER TILL 14,

01:26.253 --> 01:29.521
OR THAT YOU BROKE YOUR OWN HYMEN
      WITH A BABY CARROT.

01:29.523 --> 01:32.391
        ONLY PROBLEM IS,
 WHEN THE HOLIDAYS ROLL AROUND,

01:32.393 --> 01:36.328
   YOU STILL HAVE TO GO HOME.

01:42.036 --> 01:46.271
              ¶ ¶

01:46.273 --> 01:48.540
             - HI!

01:48.542 --> 01:50.642
     I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

01:54.582 --> 01:55.614
        - THE ALLEGHANY
       RAILROAD AUTHORITY

01:55.616 --> 01:57.683
  WELCOMES YOU TO PITTSBURGH.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.985
  YOUR TRAIN FROM NEW YORK...

01:59.987 --> 02:02.421
         - I TEXTED YOU
        ON MY NEW PHONE!

02:02.423 --> 02:05.524
       - LOOK AT MY SIGN!

02:05.526 --> 02:08.460
    - WANT TO SWITCH LIVES?

02:08.461 --> 02:11.497
 - I'D RATHER EAT MY OWN SHIT.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.731
           AND I DO!

02:12.733 --> 02:14.933
    THIS IS SHIT UP IN HERE.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.568
      - AND YET I'M STILL
        JEALOUS OF YOU.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.936
        - WHERE IS SHE?

02:17.938 --> 02:20.005
              YAY!

02:22.676 --> 02:24.843
   I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HOME.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.545
     - YEP, IT'S STILL YOU!

02:26.547 --> 02:27.880
        - UNFORTUNATELY.

02:27.882 --> 02:29.515
         - I CAN'T WAIT
      TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT

02:29.517 --> 02:31.617
        GOSSIPING ABOUT
       NORTHWESTERN BOYS.

02:31.619 --> 02:32.851
          - OR GIRLS.
        WE DON'T JUDGE.

02:32.853 --> 02:33.886
    JUST DON'T TALK DETAILS.

02:33.888 --> 02:35.120
IT GIVES YOUR MOTHER NIGHTMARES.

02:35.122 --> 02:36.421
         - NIGHTMARES,
    IT GIVES ME NIGHTMARES.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.090
 - ALSO, I HAVE SOME HUGE NEWS.

02:38.092 --> 02:40.325
- WHAT, MY TRAIN CRASHED AND
I'M ACTUALLY IN HELL RIGHT NOW?

02:40.327 --> 02:42.327
- GIL AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED!

02:44.665 --> 02:45.731
     ARE YOU LOOKING AT IT?

02:45.733 --> 02:46.765
   - YEAH, I'M LOOKING AT IT.

02:46.767 --> 02:49.701
       - IS IT BEAUTIFUL?

02:49.703 --> 02:53.539
  - SHIT, THIS IS WHY I'M GLAD
        MY FAMILY DEAD.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.212

- I MISSED YOU
         SO MUCH, BOO.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.629
- HEY, MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THIS,

03:17.631 --> 03:19.364
         I DON'T KNOW,
SOMEWHERE A LITTLE MORE PRIVATE?

03:20.434 --> 03:24.169

03:33.747 --> 03:35.681
   - I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING
   MAYBE MORE LIKE MY PLACE.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.417
       - SHH, PUBLIC SEX
      IS WAY IN RIGHT NOW.

        TERM ON YOUPORN,

    "BROTHER SISTER STUFF."

03:45.125 --> 03:46.925
             SHIT!

   HERE, HOLD MY INVISALIGN.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.698

03:52.700 --> 03:54.199
       IT'S A GLORY HOLE.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.568
      I'VE ONLY SEEN THESE
          IN GAY PORN!

03:56.570 --> 03:58.837
     - WHY ARE YOU WATCHING
           GAY PORN?

04:01.308 --> 04:02.574
             - WEE!

04:02.576 --> 04:04.743
         - WHO ARE YOU,
      FUCKING SPIDER-MAN?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.144
       - GIMME YOUR DICK!

04:06.146 --> 04:08.213

      IF I REALLY WANT TO.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.648
       YOU ODDLY RESEMBLE

04:09.650 --> 04:10.916
  THE <i> ALICE IN WONDERLAND</i> CAT
           RIGHT NOW.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.517
- STOP BEING SUCH A PUSSY,

04:12.519 --> 04:16.421
     AND GIVE ME YOUR DICK.

04:28.636 --> 04:32.337
      IT'S LIKE THE WALL'S
        EATING MY PENIS.

04:32.339 --> 04:34.172
    - WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
       WITH THESE PEOPLE?

04:34.174 --> 04:35.240
           - I KNOW.

04:35.242 --> 04:38.210
       SOME MOTHERFUCKERS
       ARE SO DISGUSTING.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.281
- DEAR GOD.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.682
HERE IT COMES.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.860
       - ARE YOU CRYING?

04:54.862 --> 04:56.295
          - I'M SORRY.

04:56.297 --> 04:59.264
     I DIDN'T KNOW HOW HARD
       THIS WAS GONNA BE.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.101
       WELL, DO YOU WANT
        TO JUST, LIKE...

05:03.103 --> 05:05.437
       PARKOUR BACK OVER
   AND FINISH ME OFF IN HERE?

05:05.439 --> 05:07.739
NO, NO.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.641
     I REALLY WANTED THERE
    TO BE A WALL BETWEEN US

05:09.643 --> 05:12.311
       WHEN I SAID THIS.

05:12.313 --> 05:13.312
        - WHAT ARE YOU--

05:13.314 --> 05:14.513
  WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.648
      - I'M SORRY, SCOTT.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.650
           IT'S OVER.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.120
            - WHAT?

05:30.297 --> 05:34.299
     - OKAY, LIKE, THIS IS
     SUPER AWKWARD, BUT...

05:34.301 --> 05:38.637

05:43.410 --> 05:44.810
       MAKE GOOD CHOICES.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.345
       - AND I WAS LIKE,
     "THAT'S THE LAST TIME

05:46.347 --> 05:49.581
      I'M EVER HAVING SEX
WITH THE CAFETERIA LADY AGAIN."

05:49.583 --> 05:51.717
          BYE, GROSS,
     STUPID FUCKING BITCH!

05:51.719 --> 05:55.320
            KIDDING.

              ¶ ¶

06:11.271 --> 06:13.338
     - JANIE, IS THAT YOU?

06:13.340 --> 06:14.573
            - JOEL.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.908
    WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:16.910 --> 06:18.243
- NOTHING MUCH.

06:18.245 --> 06:21.079
         JUST VISITING
   THE OLD STOMPING GROUNDS.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.681
   - SO ARE THE RUMORS TRUE?

06:22.683 --> 06:25.884
   I HEAR YOU'VE TURNED INTO
   QUITE THE PIMP AT CORNELL.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.419
    - YOU FOLLOW MY TUMBLR?

06:27.421 --> 06:28.553
             - NO.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.654
      - WELL, YOU SHOULD.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.022
     I POST A LOT OF BLOGS

06:31.024 --> 06:33.792
   ABOUT MY WILD ADVENTURES,

06:33.794 --> 06:35.861
     OR, AS I TITLED THEM,

06:35.863 --> 06:39.398
        "#ASSVENTURES."

06:39.400 --> 06:40.632
             SO...

06:40.634 --> 06:43.301
   - THAT SOUNDS KIND OF GAY.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.003
         - I DISAGREE.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.605
  - WELL, WELCOME HOME, JOEL.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.141
      I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

06:49.143 --> 06:50.609
      - HEY, I'M GONNA BE
      HELPING YOUR DAD OUT

06:50.611 --> 06:52.010
       AT THE VINYL VAULT
         THIS WEEKEND,

06:52.012 --> 06:53.545
    IF YOU WANT TO STOP BY.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.813
         - YEAH, MAYBE.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.248
          - YEAH, MAN,
      IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH

06:56.250 --> 07:00.552
   TO BOX UP THAT WHOLE PLACE
      BY MONDAY, YOU KNOW?

07:00.554 --> 07:02.020
  - WHY ARE YOU BOXING IT UP?

07:02.022 --> 07:05.857
       - 'CAUSE YOUR DAD
      IS CLOSING IT DOWN,

07:05.859 --> 07:07.459
       WHICH I'M GUESSING

07:07.461 --> 07:10.762
 HE WANTED TO TELL YOU HIMSELF.

07:14.334 --> 07:17.002
           HELL YEAH,
    I THINK THAT WENT WELL.

07:17.004 --> 07:20.005
     - ¶ OOH, YOU'RE FIXIN'
           MY HAIR ¶

07:20.007 --> 07:24.976
          - I CAN SEE
     THAT YOU'VE READ THEM.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.445
     - WELL, I SEE COLLEGE
         HASN'T ALTERED

07:26.447 --> 07:28.647
       YOUR SOPHISTICATED
       EATING HABITS ANY.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.148
        - NOT NOW, DAD.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.349
     - HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY
          WE CHECK OUT

07:31.351 --> 07:32.951
        THIS SURREALIST
      PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBIT

07:32.953 --> 07:34.586
AT THE ART MUSEUM THIS WEEKEND?

07:34.588 --> 07:37.456
    - I'D SAY I'M SU-REALLY
   NOT IN THE MOOD RIGHT NOW.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.924
            SO, NO.

07:38.926 --> 07:42.794
    - WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.129
     - WHAT THE HELL, DAD?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.364
   YOU'RE CLOSING THE STORE?

07:46.366 --> 07:47.232
            - WHAT?

07:47.234 --> 07:49.134
  THE VAULT'S AN INSTITUTION.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.169
  - I WAS GONNA TELL YOU GUYS
    ABOUT THAT THIS WEEKEND.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.171
      - YET YOU TOLD JOEL
           BEFORE US.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.640
   - JOEL'S MY BEST EMPLOYEE.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.709
     HE'S EASY TO TALK TO.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.277
       KIND OF SOOTHING,

07:59.279 --> 08:00.445
         LIKE A WOMAN.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.713
        - ARE WE BROKE?

08:01.715 --> 08:02.981
       - COME ON IN HERE.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.116
           SIT DOWN;
     LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.921
   YES, I'M SELLING THE SHOP.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.389
      NO, WE'RE NOT BROKE.

08:11.391 --> 08:14.125
  TRUTH IS, THE STORE IS DOING
    PRETTY WELL FINANCIALLY.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.328
    BUT MOST OF THE BUSINESS
   IS FROM COLLECTORS ONLINE,

08:16.330 --> 08:20.632
   SO KEEPING THE STORE OPEN
  DOESN'T MAKE SENSE ANYMORE.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.502
      ALSO, I MET SOMEONE.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.603
           - YOU DID?

08:24.605 --> 08:26.271
          - ANASTASIA.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.740
         - A STRIPPER?

08:28.742 --> 08:29.774
             WHAT?

08:29.776 --> 08:31.209
 I MEAN, WITH A NAME LIKE THAT,

08:31.211 --> 08:33.111
 SHE'S EITHER A DISNEY PRINCESS
        OR A TOTAL SLUT.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.347
    - COME ON, SHE'S A VINYL
   COLLECTOR DOWN IN FLORIDA.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.381
             - BOO.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.414
      - AND I WAS THINKING

08:37.417 --> 08:38.717
     AFTER JANIE GRADUATED
          THIS SPRING,

08:38.719 --> 08:39.985
 I'D MOVE DOWN THERE WITH HER.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.052
   THIS IS PLACE IS GONNA BE

08:41.054 --> 08:43.221
    WAY TOO BIG FOR JUST ME,
            ANYHOW.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.523
           BUT, HEY,

08:44.525 --> 08:47.192
 WE HAVE ONE LAST THANKSGIVING
    AT HOME BEFORE WE MOVE.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.227
     THAT'LL BE FUN, RIGHT?

08:57.538 --> 08:59.271
             OKAY.

08:59.273 --> 09:01.506
           GOOD TALK.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.875
     - AM I DOING IT RIGHT?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.010
             - NO!

09:05.012 --> 09:06.578
       LOU, POP YOUR ASS!

09:06.580 --> 09:09.781
  - I CAN'T BELIEVE MY PARENTS
   TURNED MY ROOM INTO A GYM.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.383
      - LOU, POP THAT ASS!

09:11.385 --> 09:12.784
       WATCH MY ASS POP.

09:12.786 --> 09:13.852
     - YOUR ASS IS POPPIN'.

09:13.854 --> 09:14.853
            - YEAH.

09:14.855 --> 09:15.954
   - GIRL, IT COULD BE WORSE.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.155
  I KNOW A CHICK WHOSE PARENTS

09:17.157 --> 09:19.224
        TURNED HER ROOM
      INTO A SEX DUNGEON.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.792
    - NOT SURE THAT'S WORSE.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.862
POP THAT ASS,
  POP THAT ASS, POP THAT ASS.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.196
     - GIRL, WHY DON'T YOU
        GO OUT TONIGHT,

09:25.198 --> 09:26.731
   GET YOUR MIND OFF THINGS?

09:26.733 --> 09:29.167
      - THE ONLY WAY THAT
 I COULD GET MY MIND OFF THINGS

09:29.169 --> 09:32.537
  WOULD BE TO JOIN A CULT AND
GET MYSELF FUCKING BRAINWASHED.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.506
    - GIRL, DON'T EVEN PLAY
        ABOUT THAT SHIT.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.942
      I JOINED A CULT ONCE
BECAUSE THEY HAD RED TRACK SUITS

09:36.944 --> 09:39.144
          AND I WANTED
       A RED TRACK SUIT.

09:39.146 --> 09:42.147
     THE AMOUNT OF INNOCENT
         I SAW SLAIN...

09:42.149 --> 09:44.683
         WAS NOT WORTH
      THAT RED TRACK SUIT.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.087
- GOD.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.524
      APPARENTLY, THERE IS
    A KEGGER ON PLUM STREET

09:52.526 --> 09:53.758
         BY THE CREEK.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.393
    - A KEGGER BY THE CREEK?

09:55.395 --> 09:56.795
 TELL ME YOU MADE THAT SHIT UP.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.263
 IT SOUNDS LIKE A HORROR MOVIE.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.632
- BELIEVE ME,
      IT IS ALL TOO REAL.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.500
- WELL, THEN GO, AND TAKE VIDEO.

10:02.502 --> 10:05.537
      I WANT TO SEE WHERE
  TORI THE WHORIE COMES FROM.

10:05.539 --> 10:08.173
  - NO, LOOK, THE WHOLE POINT
      OF GOING TO COLLEGE

10:08.175 --> 10:10.108
         IS TO GET AWAY
     FROM ALL OF THE PEOPLE

10:10.110 --> 10:12.444
 THAT YOU HATED IN HIGH SCHOOL.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.079
        WHY WOULD I WANT
      TO GO BACK TO THAT?

10:14.081 --> 10:15.513
      I MEAN, IT WOULD BE
   LIKE TAKING A MASSIVE SHIT

10:15.515 --> 10:18.917
      AND THEN SHOVING IT
     RIGHT BACK UP MY BUTT.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.452
        - REALLY, GIRL?

10:20.454 --> 10:23.088
    - PLUS, I'M TOTALLY FINE
     SPENDING THE NIGHT IN.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.889
- I'M GONNA FART.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.224
- GO AHEAD, HONEY.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.759
  - NO, IT'S GONNA BE SO LOUD.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.862
- COME ON, WE'VE BEEN
     MARRIED FOR 25 YEARS.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.635
- MY GOD;
          MY GOD.

10:36.637 --> 10:37.769
              I...

10:37.771 --> 10:42.007
     I HAVE MESSED MYSELF.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.975
              OOH.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.211
           OOH, YEAH.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.550
OKAY, OKAY.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.686
        - GIRL, YOU NEED
     TO GET OUT THAT HOUSE.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.454
    - I'LL SEND YOU VIDEOS.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.229
    - YO, QUEEF, SICK PARTY!

11:04.231 --> 11:05.630
    - THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.899
     I HOPE YOU'RE ENJOYING
    THE DELICIOUS LIBATIONS

11:07.901 --> 11:10.135
  AND JOVIAL ATMOSPHERE, YEAH?

11:10.137 --> 11:11.436
 - HOW DID YOU GET YOUR PARENTS

11:11.438 --> 11:12.604
   TO LET YOU HAVE THE HOUSE
          ALL WEEKEND?

11:12.606 --> 11:14.272
- NOT EVEN A PROBLEM,
            BROTHER.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.976
YOU SEE, I HAVE AN OPEN DIALOGUE
      WITH MATA AND PITA.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.377
  THEY RESPECT ME AS AN ADULT,

11:19.379 --> 11:23.348
         AND THEY TRUST
       MY WISE DECISIONS.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.951
       - I JUST THREW UP
     IN THIS GENIE BOTTLE.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.554
    - THAT'S MY GRANDMOTHER!

11:29.556 --> 11:31.122
      - LET HER OUT, MAN.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.291
          LET HER OUT!

11:33.293 --> 11:37.228
   - ¶ I WAS LIKE, "EXCUSE ME
   AND MY AWKWARD APPROACH" ¶

11:37.230 --> 11:39.531
         - HEY, THIS IS
       MY PERSONAL HELL.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.799
         - SHIT, SHIT.

11:40.801 --> 11:41.933
     - AW, THAT'S ADORABLE.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.334
YOU'RE STILL OBSESSED WITH HER.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.470
      - NO, I'M NOT STILL
       OBSESSED WITH HER.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.337
        - YES, YOU ARE.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.639
     WHEN IS HER BIRTHDAY?

11:47.641 --> 11:49.174
     - JANUARY 15TH, 1996.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.542
           NICE TRY.
      EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.143
  - WELL, NO ONE GIVE'S A FUCK
           ABOUT ME,

11:52.145 --> 11:54.646
    SO ONLY YOU SHOULD KNOW,
      WHEN'S MY BIRTHDAY?

11:54.648 --> 11:56.381
            - UM...

11:56.383 --> 11:58.083
             TODAY?

11:58.085 --> 11:59.084
MY GOD, TODAY.

12:01.121 --> 12:04.456
      all: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

12:04.458 --> 12:06.658

12:06.660 --> 12:09.961
       - LISTEN, THIS IS
        MY LAST CHANCE.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.797
JANIE IS MOVING DOWN TO FLORIDA
 AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.

12:12.799 --> 12:13.865
- MY GOD.
           - I KNOW.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.300
           - NO WAY.
             - YES.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.768
- MY GOD, THAT MEANS
     YOU'RE ONLY GONNA HAVE

12:16.770 --> 12:17.802
CHRISTMAS BREAK AND SPRING BREAK

12:17.804 --> 12:18.970
        TO NOT FUCK HER.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.338
 - FALSE, BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO

12:20.340 --> 12:21.940
        VISIT MY STUPID,
       DYING GRANDPARENTS

12:21.942 --> 12:23.942

   THEN I'M HITTING UP CANCUN
      WITH THE PUSSY POSSE

12:25.879 --> 12:27.345

    USE THAT NICKNAME AGAIN,

12:33.453 --> 12:34.753
      I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU
         IN THE PENIS.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.054
      - OKAY, YOU'RE BEING
        VERY AGGRESSIVE.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.388
       JUST HEAR ME OUT.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.124
      THIS IS MY LAST SHOT

12:39.126 --> 12:43.261
         BEFORE SHE IS
    OUT OF MY LIFE FOREVER.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.363
       - OKAY, UM, LOOK,

12:45.365 --> 12:47.165
     I'M GONNA TRY REALLY,
          REALLY HARD

12:47.167 --> 12:48.266

12:50.537 --> 12:52.403
      SHE WAS NOT INTO YOU
        IN HIGH SCHOOL.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.239
    SHE'S NOT INTO YOU NOW.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.040
        AND SHE'S NEVER
       GONNA BE INTO YOU.

12:56.042 --> 13:00.378
  BUT I JUST--YOU KNOW, I FEEL
   LIKE IT'S TIME WE MOVE ON.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.546
            - OKAY.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.413
          OKAY, YEAH.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.615
  YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.649
         YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:04.651 --> 13:05.483
      - SHIT, YOU, LIKE--

 YOU HANDLED THAT REALLY WELL.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.720
          - PSYCH, NO,

      SHE'S TOTALLY GONNA
 SIT ON MY FACE LATER, LIKE...

13:13.326 --> 13:15.527
    - WOW, THAT'S REALLY NOT
   HOW THAT GOES DOWN AT ALL,

         SO IT'S CLEAR
    YOU'VE NEVER DONE THAT.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.033
  I KNOW IT'S A PRIME NUMBER.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.701
 - GOD, PLEASE STOP DOING THAT.

13:23.703 --> 13:24.702
         DID YOU SPIT?

13:24.704 --> 13:26.104
             - YES.
      - THAT'S DISGUSTING.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.372
        - A LITTLE BIT.
         - DON'T SPIT.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.873
 WHERE DID THE STRAW COME FROM?

13:28.875 --> 13:29.908
         - MY BACKPACK.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.209
 - YOU HAVE A FUCKING BACKPACK?

13:31.211 --> 13:32.210
   - YES, I HAVE A BACKPACK.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.211
       IT'S AN ADVENTURE.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.913
       IT'S LIKE A HIKE.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.582
      THIS PARTY IS #LAME.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.717

    BUT LAST TIME I SAW HER,

13:49.696 --> 13:52.463
   SHE PRETENDED TO TRIP AND
 GRABBED MY COOCH FOR BALANCE.

     I KNOCKED THAT MIDTERM
        OUT OF THE PARK.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.213
     I REMEMBER HE ACTUALLY
    SAID TO ME, AND I QUOTE,

16:22.215 --> 16:24.549
     "YOU MADE THAT MIDTERM
          YOUR BITCH."

16:24.551 --> 16:26.985
      OR, NO--OR HE SAID,
     "YOU DID A GOOD JOB."

16:26.987 --> 16:28.486
     BUT HE MEANT IT, SO...

16:28.488 --> 16:30.021
      I MEAN, DON'T WORRY.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.456
           NO CHARGE.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.158
     JUST TWO STUDY BUDDIES
      DOING WHAT THEY DO,

16:34.160 --> 16:35.326
       SHOOTING THE SHIT.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.627
 WHIP OUT A HIGHLIGHTER OR TWO,

16:36.629 --> 16:38.796
        MAKE SOME MARKS
      ON THOSE TEXTBOOKS.

16:38.798 --> 16:43.034
      I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
    WHAT THE LIBRARIAN SAYS.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.303
     - OKAY, WHAT THE HELL.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.671
          - SERIOUSLY?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.306
- - OKAY.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.440
           YEAH, YES.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.342
  SO YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.477
           I PROMISE.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.413
     HOW IS 8:00 ON FRIDAY?

16:55.415 --> 16:56.647
         - SOUNDS GOOD.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.916
 - GOOD, I THINK SO TOO, YEAH.

16:58.918 --> 17:01.386
             OKAY.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.420
              BYE.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.589
I LOVE YOU, SO MUCH.

17:05.592 --> 17:09.193
    - THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
   I'VE DRANK IN, LIKE, EVER.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.895
    BUT I FEEL TOTALLY FINE.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.164
      - YEAH, NO, YOU LOOK
         TOTALLY GREAT,

17:13.165 --> 17:14.432
    NOT AT ALL LIKE A RHINO

17:14.434 --> 17:16.701
        WHO'S BEEN SHOT
    WITH A TRANQUILIZER GUN.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.471
      I THINK THE FUCKING
      TIKKA MASALA SHIT'S

17:20.473 --> 17:22.373
      GONNA COME BACK UP.

17:27.313 --> 17:30.915
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.617
        WANT TO HOOK UP?

17:34.220 --> 17:35.253
        - SHE SAID YES.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.254
         SHE SAID YES.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.622
         MOVE, FUCKERS.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.290
  SHE SAID YES, SHE SAID YES,
         SHE SAID YES.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.025
NO.

17:41.027 --> 17:42.160
            - YEAH.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.528
      SO I'M GONNA GO NOW.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.529
       - HEY, MOTHERFUCK,

17:44.531 --> 17:45.530
      DID YOU NOT HEAR ME?

17:45.532 --> 17:46.764
         SHE SAID YES.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.833
- MY GOD,
      THAT IS SO EXCITING.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.501
       HEY, AT WHAT POINT
      IN THIS CONVERSATION

17:50.503 --> 17:53.271
  ARE WE GOING TO ACKNOWLEDGE
   THAT I'M COVERED IN VOMIT?

17:53.273 --> 17:54.338
    - WHAT AM I GONNA WEAR?

17:54.340 --> 17:56.140
     SHOULD I WEAR A SUIT?

17:56.142 --> 17:58.643
       MAYBE ONE OF THOSE
      SEXY-ASS TIGHT VESTS

17:58.645 --> 18:00.344
   WITH, LIKE, A DRAGON ON IT
     FOR NO FUCKING REASON.

18:00.346 --> 18:01.779
 AND SHE'S LIKE, "WHAT'S THAT?"

18:01.781 --> 18:03.214
         AND I'M LIKE,
     DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.882
        BUT I DON'T KNOW
 WHERE TO TAKE HER FOR DINNER,

18:04.884 --> 18:06.417
    BECAUSE I OBVIOUSLY WANT
  TO TAKE HER SOMEWHERE NICE,

18:06.419 --> 18:08.586
        BUT I DON'T WANT
       TO FREAK HER OUT.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.254
      - THERE'S ABOUT TEN
     DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS

18:10.256 --> 18:11.389
    UP IN THAT GIRL'S VOMIT,

18:11.391 --> 18:13.724
   SO YOU CAN TAKE YOUR PICK.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.128
           - TEXT ME.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.297
         - SUCK A DICK.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.099
             - NO.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.813
    - SHIT, LOOK, I'M SORRY,

18:35.815 --> 18:39.016
  BUT YOU CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

18:39.018 --> 18:41.853
             SCOTT?

18:41.855 --> 18:43.387
        - DO I KNOW YOU?

18:43.389 --> 18:47.158
          - WE WENT TO
     HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.392
       AND MIDDLE SCHOOL,

18:48.394 --> 18:52.430
        AND ELEMENTARY.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.631
       - TORI THE WHORIE?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.166
       - AND WE'RE BACK.

18:55.168 --> 18:56.567
             - WOW.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.002
   YOU LOOK KIND OF GOOD NOW.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.103
    YOU KNOW, THAT NICKNAME

18:59.105 --> 19:01.439
       MIGHT NOT EVEN BE
      THAT IRONIC ANYMORE.

19:01.441 --> 19:02.840
       - CHARMING, OKAY.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.642
     WELL, YOU'RE NOT DEAD,
        SO I'M GONNA GO.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.444
   BUT THIS HAS BEEN SO FUN.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.979
           THANK YOU.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.682
             FUCK.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.886
       CAN I GET A RIDE?

19:18.758 --> 19:21.692
      SO YOU KNOW THIS IS
   A REALLY BAD IDEA, RIGHT?

19:21.694 --> 19:23.728
     - IT SAYS THE PARTY IS
    ONLY ONE MILE FROM HERE.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.129
- FANTASTIC,
    I'M GLAD THERE'S AN APP

19:25.131 --> 19:26.931
     THAT CAN MAKE STALKING
        MORE EFFICIENT.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.566
   - I'M NOT STALKING, OKAY?

19:28.568 --> 19:31.035
  I'M MERELY USING TECHNOLOGY
   TO HELP ME LOCATE SOMEONE

19:31.037 --> 19:34.071
 WHO DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO ME
         AT THE MOMENT.

19:34.073 --> 19:35.072
       WHICH IS STALKING.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.309
     - OOH, MAKE THAT LEFT.

19:38.311 --> 19:41.979
     - YOU DO REALIZE THAT
    YOU'RE PATHETIC, RIGHT?

19:41.981 --> 19:46.083
     - YOU DO REALIZE THAT
YOU'RE COVERED IN VOMIT, RIGHT?

19:46.085 --> 19:48.085
       BESIDES, HEATHER'S
      GONNA TAKE ME BACK.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.354
- FANTASTIC, SO NOT ONLY
       ARE YOU A STALKER,

19:50.356 --> 19:51.589
  BUT YOU'RE A MISOGYNIST TOO.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.990
     - AND I'M A ROMANTIC.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.092
     - HO-HO, AND WHY WOULD
     HEATHER TAKE YOU BACK?

19:55.094 --> 19:56.627
      'CAUSE I THINK SHE'S
    MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR

19:56.629 --> 19:58.963
     THAT SHE WANTS NOTHING
        TO DO WITH YOU.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.398
        - SHE JUST NEEDS
       SOME TIME TO THINK

20:00.400 --> 20:01.532
   AND, YOU KNOW, REEVALUATE.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.533
        SHE'LL BE FINE.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.035
- WOW.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.704
 BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY SHE MUST BE
    IN A WEIRD MENTAL PLACE

20:06.706 --> 20:09.974
    TO DUMP YOU, MR. PERFECT
     WITH THE AMAZING HAIR.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.409
  - THINK I HAVE AMAZING HAIR?

20:11.411 --> 20:12.743
- MY GOD,
  YOU KNOW YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.145
         IT'S ANNOYING.

20:14.147 --> 20:16.614
      - WOW, AMAZING HAIR
      AND I'M ATTRACTIVE?

20:16.616 --> 20:18.316
       - YEAH, HERE I GO.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.617
        - WAIT A MINUTE.

20:19.619 --> 20:20.952
        ARE YOU INTO ME?

20:20.954 --> 20:23.020
           - NO, GOD,
       I'M NOT INTO YOU.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.922
    I MEAN, WOULD I HAVE SEX
           WITH YOU?

20:24.924 --> 20:27.825
 YEAH, PROBABLY, BUT THAT DOES
  NOT MEAN THAT I'M INTO YOU.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.927
   - YOU'D HAVE SEX WITH ME?

20:31.931 --> 20:33.464
WOW, I MEAN, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.299
       I'M JUST SURPRISED
THAT YOU ACTUALLY ADMITTED THAT.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.968
- MY GOD, IT'S 2014.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.836
      WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE
   TO OPENLY TALK ABOUT SEX.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.271
        - I MEAN, I KNOW
        WHAT YEAR IT IS.

20:40.273 --> 20:41.606
       I'M JUST SAYING--

20:41.608 --> 20:42.873
   - OKAY, HERE'S THE THING,
           PROM KING.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.175
     WOMEN THINK ABOUT SEX
         ALL THE TIME,

20:44.177 --> 20:45.977
    INCLUDING YOUR PRECIOUS,
       WONDERFUL HEATHER.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.912
      SO IF SHE WANTED YOU
          IN HER BED,

20:47.914 --> 20:49.847
  YOU WOULDN'T BE IN THIS CAR
       WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

20:49.849 --> 20:53.517
      AND THAT IS A FACT.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.219
WAIT,
      HOLD ON ONE SECOND,

20:55.221 --> 20:57.088
     BECAUSE I REALLY WANT
         TO FILM THIS,

20:57.090 --> 21:01.425
      BECAUSE FAIL VIDEOS
        ALWAYS GO VIRAL.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.461
             GO ON.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.562
     - YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

21:04.564 --> 21:05.630
 MAYBE NOW ISN'T THE BEST TIME.

21:05.632 --> 21:06.797
- NO, COME ON, SCOTT.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.232
 THE INTERNET WANTS TO SEE YOU

21:08.234 --> 21:11.369
    GET KICKED IN THE BALLS
          REALLY BAD.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.170
     - WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN?

21:13.172 --> 21:14.572
          - I'M MEAN?

21:14.574 --> 21:16.240
 WOW, THAT'S A DOUBLE STANDARD.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.576
 I RECALL IT GOING A LITTLE BIT
  DIFFERENTLY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

21:18.578 --> 21:21.545
   MAYBE NOBODY HAS TOLD YOU
   THAT HIGH SCHOOL IS OVER.

21:21.547 --> 21:23.514
    THAT BIG CEREMONY THING
        THAT WE ALL DID,

21:23.516 --> 21:24.749
      THAT WAS GRADUATION,

21:24.751 --> 21:25.816
      WHERE WE ALL MOVE ON

21:25.818 --> 21:27.084
AND WE ALL DO DIFFERENT THINGS.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.452
      YOU DON'T STAY HERE
          AND BE LIKE,

21:28.454 --> 21:29.720
"I WAS PROM KING; I'M COOL,

21:29.722 --> 21:30.888
         SO THAT MEANS
       I'M COOL FOREVER."

21:30.890 --> 21:32.390
      NOBODY GIVES A SHIT.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.992
       SO MAYBE IT'S TIME
  THAT YOU TRY SOMETHING NEW.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.494
         TRY SOMETHING
    A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT,

21:36.496 --> 21:38.362
 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS WHOLE--

21:51.577 --> 21:53.177
         - WAIT, WAIT.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.813
          I DON'T HAVE
       ANY CONDOMS ON ME.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.317
          WHO ARE YOU?

21:59.319 --> 22:00.718
       - TORI THE WHORIE.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.886
- YEAH,
   I CAME UP WITH THAT NAME.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.155
   - YEAH, YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE.

22:09.195 --> 22:11.662
       - TORI THE WHORIE
        IS BACK, BITCH!

22:11.664 --> 22:12.830
     - OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

22:12.832 --> 22:14.265
       SHE NEVER EXISTED.

22:14.267 --> 22:16.734
         SECOND OF ALL,
       IT WAS A MISTAKE.

22:16.736 --> 22:20.338
 IT WAS A BIG, STUPID MISTAKE.

22:20.340 --> 22:21.939
           - HOW BIG?

22:21.941 --> 22:22.907
            - WHAT?

22:22.909 --> 22:24.275
        - COME ON, GIRL,
       GIVE ME SOMETHING.

22:24.277 --> 22:26.377
    I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT PORN
       SINCE I GOT HOME.

22:27.413 --> 22:28.546
     IT WAS HUGE, ENORMOUS.

22:28.548 --> 22:29.714
    AND HE PUT IT IN MY BUTT

22:29.716 --> 22:31.182
   AND SLAPPED ME IN MY FACE
            WITH IT.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.317
 - I KNOW YOU'RE LYING, BUT...

22:33.319 --> 22:34.452
           THANK YOU.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.620
    - I JUST--I REALLY WANT
      TO FORGET ABOUT IT.

22:36.622 --> 22:38.489
        - SO YOU'RE NOT
      GONNA SEE HIM AGAIN?

22:38.491 --> 22:39.890
 - NO, IT WAS A ONE-TIME THING.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.625
       I'M NEVER TALKING
     TO THAT DOUCHE AGAIN.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.428
     AND DOES HE KNOW THAT?

22:44.430 --> 22:45.663
- PLEASE.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.598
        SCOTT IS SO FAR
        UP HIS OWN ASS,

22:47.600 --> 22:49.066
     HE WON'T EVEN NOTICE.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.702
           - HOW FAR?

22:54.574 --> 22:55.773
      - HERE'S THE TURKEY.

22:55.775 --> 22:56.841
        HERE'S THE BIRD.

23:12.325 --> 23:15.059
    HEY, I'M SORRY YOU GUYS
      GOT STUCK OVER HERE.

23:15.061 --> 23:18.329
    - HEY, AT LEAST WE DON'T
HAVE TO SIT WITH CRAZY AUNT FLO.

23:18.331 --> 23:20.364
     - DID I EVER TELL YOU
         ABOUT THE TIME

23:20.366 --> 23:22.066
   I GOT ABDUCTED BY ALIENS?

23:22.068 --> 23:24.135
     FUNNY STORY, ACTUALLY.

23:25.471 --> 23:27.371
  THEIR QUEEN IMPREGNATED ME,

23:27.373 --> 23:32.843
 AND THE BABY GREW TO FULL SIZE
   IN LESS THAN EIGHT HOURS.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.780
    AND THEN IT ATE ITS WAY
       OUT OF MY UTERUS.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.314
     WANT TO SEE THE SCAR?

23:39.786 --> 23:41.585
    - WHY CAN'T WE JUST HAVE
       AN ALCOHOLIC AUNT

23:41.587 --> 23:43.387
    LIKE EVERY OTHER FAMILY?

23:43.389 --> 23:47.458
  - TODAY, YOU CAN CONSIDER ME
      AN ALCOHOLIC FATHER.

23:51.731 --> 23:54.598
      - HEY, YOU REMEMBER
        TORI THE WHORIE?

23:54.600 --> 23:58.436

         IN YOUR MOUTH.

32:34.486 --> 32:35.485
         YOU'RE A LADY.

32:35.487 --> 32:36.887
     WHERE SHOULD I DO IT?

32:36.889 --> 32:38.455
IDEA.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.357
         ON THOSE TITS!

32:40.359 --> 32:42.392
  - HEY, WHAT YOU LOOKING AT?

32:42.394 --> 32:43.393
        - THE INTERNET.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.495
     THERE'S JUST PICTURES

32:45.497 --> 32:48.799
      OF ARCTIC CREATURES,
          POLAR BEARS.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.200
         - POLAR BEARS.
        - GOING EXTINCT.

32:50.202 --> 32:51.501
            - I SEE.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.603
- YO, DICK-MUNCHER, TIME TO GO.

32:53.605 --> 32:54.838
  BLACK FRIDAY'S ALMOST OVER,

32:54.840 --> 32:57.507
       AND I HAVEN'T SEEN
        ANYBODY DIE YET.

33:02.414 --> 33:05.048
- THIS--

33:05.050 --> 33:06.216
           HOMEWORK.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.118
            SEX-ED.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.053
          NEVER MIND.

33:13.559 --> 33:16.293
       OKAY, SO THIS ONE
 IS A BIT ON THE PRICIER SIDE.

33:16.295 --> 33:18.095
       BUT SHE PINNED IT
         MULTIPLE TIMES

33:18.097 --> 33:19.663
TO HER PERSONAL PINTEREST PAGE,

33:19.665 --> 33:23.000
     AND I WANT HER TO FEEL
AS BEAUTIFUL AS I DO RIGHT NOW,

33:23.002 --> 33:25.535
         WHICH IS VERY.

33:25.537 --> 33:28.238
  - I JUST WANT YOU TO REALIZE
     HOW FUCKED UP THIS IS.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.806
      - IF BY "FUCKED UP"
        YOU MEAN AWESOME

33:29.808 --> 33:32.275
   AND SEXUALLY STIMULATING,
         THEN I AGREE.

33:32.277 --> 33:33.677
         BUT I NEED YOU
      TO FOCUS RIGHT NOW,

33:33.679 --> 33:36.013
         BECAUSE I NEED
      YOUR BRUTAL HONESTY.

33:40.519 --> 33:41.518
 - YEAH, THAT'S WAY TOO SLUTTY.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.086
    IF YOU GIVE THAT TO HER,

33:43.088 --> 33:44.955
       SHE'S GONNA THINK
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO BANG HER.

33:44.957 --> 33:46.089
          - BUT I AM.

33:46.091 --> 33:47.324
         - YES, I KNOW.

33:47.326 --> 33:51.294
         BUT THE KEY IS
    TO MAKE HER FORGET THAT.

33:51.296 --> 33:53.130
          - GOOD NOTE.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.269
          - HEY, TORI.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.638
        - WHAT THE FUCK?

34:01.640 --> 34:03.473
      - HEY, CRAZY, RIGHT?

34:04.943 --> 34:07.844
     - UM, HEY, I JUST WANT
          TO SAY SORRY

34:07.846 --> 34:10.179
  FOR COMING TO YOUR FAMILY'S
       DINNER LAST NIGHT.

34:10.181 --> 34:12.315
           THAT WAS--
  I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

34:12.317 --> 34:13.717
     IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.620
   - YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
       IS INAPPROPRIATE?

34:16.621 --> 34:19.121
          YOU STALKING
      MY INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT

34:19.123 --> 34:20.757
     AND FOLLOWING ME HERE.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.326
  - DOES THIS LOOK TOO, LIKE,
     "OOH, I DID ANAL ONCE,

34:23.328 --> 34:25.328
   AND NOW IT'S ALL I WANT"?

34:25.330 --> 34:27.030
             SCOTT.

34:27.032 --> 34:28.431
      DID JANIE SEND YOU?

34:28.434 --> 34:31.234
            - WHAT?
       NO, WHY WOULD SHE?

34:31.235 --> 34:32.735
          - NO REASON.

34:35.808 --> 34:36.606
            - OKAY.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.842
  SO BACK TO YOU STALKING ME.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.178
       - AW, YOU THOUGHT
       I'M STALKING YOU?

34:41.179 --> 34:42.612
 NO, I WAS JUST TAKING PICTURES
          IN THE MALL,

34:42.614 --> 34:44.047
         AND I SAW YOU
      THROUGH THE WINDOW.

34:44.049 --> 34:46.683
     - 'CAUSE THAT DOESN'T
         SOUND CREEPY.

34:49.021 --> 34:51.388
       - I LIKE SHOOTING
ALL THE BLACK FRIDAY CRAZINESS.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.589
          USUALLY GET
    SOME PRETTY COOL STUFF.

34:52.591 --> 34:53.857
   I MEAN, FOR THE MOST PART,

34:53.859 --> 34:57.194
    IT'S JUST RANDOM PEOPLE
        GETTING TASERED.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.162
 - ALL RIGHT, LET ME SEE THAT.

35:07.406 --> 35:11.408
    DUDE, THIS IS FUCKED UP.

35:11.410 --> 35:13.577
  WOULD YOU SEND THESE TO ME?

35:15.981 --> 35:19.116
              AW.

35:19.118 --> 35:23.386
I FOUND YOUR FETISH.

35:23.388 --> 35:25.622
IT'S NOT A FETISH.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.724
       - HEY, LOOK CLOSE.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.426
  YOU SEE HOW THAT OLD COUPLE
      IS SITTING PERFECTLY

35:29.428 --> 35:32.329
  RIGHT BETWEEN THAT TRASH CAN
 AND THAT STAINED GLASS WINDOW

35:32.331 --> 35:33.530
       AND THAT FOUNTAIN?

35:33.532 --> 35:35.565
          IT'S LIKE--

35:35.567 --> 35:38.101
    IT'S KIND OF LIKE BEAUTY
      MEETS ITS OPPOSITE.

35:38.103 --> 35:39.536
           YOU KNOW?

35:39.538 --> 35:41.271
    AMIDST ALL THE CRAZINESS
        OF BLACK FRIDAY

35:41.273 --> 35:44.441
        AND EVERYBODY'S
   FREAKING OUT AROUND THEM,

35:44.443 --> 35:46.243
    THEY'RE SAFE, YOU KNOW?

35:46.245 --> 35:50.480
 THEY FOUND THEIR LITTLE PLACE
    TO GO AND SHARE A KISS.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.350
 IT'S KIND OF CUTE, BEAUTIFUL.

35:53.352 --> 35:56.219
- MY GOD.

35:56.221 --> 35:58.755
         I DIDN'T SLEEP
       WITH THE COOL GUY.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.991
          I SLEPT WITH
     THE FORMERLY COOL GUY

36:00.993 --> 36:05.529
         WHO'S ACTUALLY
      A BIG FRICKIN' DORK.

36:05.531 --> 36:06.763
I'M NOT A DORK.

36:06.765 --> 36:07.797
I'M COOL.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.266
     - I'M CURRENTLY COOL.

36:09.268 --> 36:10.367
- OKAY.

36:10.369 --> 36:11.668
     SO THEN, JUST TELL ME

36:11.670 --> 36:14.137
    ONE CURRENTLY COOL THING
        THAT YOU'VE DONE

36:14.139 --> 36:16.206
        POST-GRADUATION.

36:21.613 --> 36:24.614
   WHAT ARE YOU DOING LATER?

36:24.616 --> 36:25.782
      - I DON'T KNOW, WHY?

36:25.784 --> 36:27.350
  - 'CAUSE WE'RE HANGING OUT.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.686
REALLY?

36:29.688 --> 36:30.754
          - ALL RIGHT.

36:30.756 --> 36:31.788
      - BUT I AM DRIVING,

36:31.790 --> 36:33.123
 AND I AM PLANNING EVERYTHING.

36:33.125 --> 36:36.459
       AND YOU HAVE TO DO
     EVERYTHING THAT I SAY.

36:36.461 --> 36:39.362
       - ALL RIGHT, DEAL.

36:39.364 --> 36:40.764
          - ALL RIGHT.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.799
     NOW GO CONTINUE TAKING
     THOSE CREEPY PICTURES,

36:42.801 --> 36:44.467
     AND QUIT STALKING ME.

36:44.469 --> 36:46.436
  - IS THIS GUY STALKING YOU?

37:10.896 --> 37:13.897
   - ¶ I USED TO WAIT FOR HER
         AFTER SCHOOL ¶

37:13.899 --> 37:17.234
 ¶ BY THE GATES WITH MY BOOKS,
     BABY, FEELING A FOOL ¶

37:17.236 --> 37:21.071
   ¶ I USED TO WALK HER HOME
         EVERY NIGHT ¶

37:21.073 --> 37:24.975
   ¶ IN THE SUMMER OR WINTER,
      IN THE SUN OR ICE ¶

37:37.389 --> 37:39.022
        - FUCK IT LIST.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.724
      OKAY, WHAT IS THIS,
   SOME KIND OF BUCKET LIST?

37:40.726 --> 37:42.325
         - YEAH, EXCEPT
      YOU DON'T DIE IN IT.

37:42.327 --> 37:44.628
    - I MEAN, SPOILER ALERT.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.429
        - OKAY, THIS IS
    WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.999
  YOU'RE LIKE, SO REGIMENTED.

37:49.001 --> 37:50.200
  I MEAN, EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU

37:50.202 --> 37:52.135
        HAS TO BE, LIKE,
      SO FUCKING PERFECT,

37:52.137 --> 37:53.837
    OR YOU, LIKE, FREAK OUT.

37:53.839 --> 37:55.238
     SO, WHAT I'M GONNA DO

37:55.240 --> 37:57.707
     IS JUST LOOSEN YOU UP
         A LITTLE BIT.

37:59.711 --> 38:00.910
   - I'M NOT SHAVING MY HEAD.

38:00.912 --> 38:03.680
  - OKAY, ONE THING AT A TIME.

38:03.682 --> 38:04.848
 - SERIOUSLY, I'M NOT DOING IT.

38:04.850 --> 38:05.982
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.450
     YOU'RE SO REGIMENTED.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.818
         - LOOK AT IT.
          - I SEE IT.

38:08.820 --> 38:09.819
  - LOOK AT THE WAY IT FLOWS.

38:09.821 --> 38:10.854
     - NO, YEAH, I SEE IT.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.389
    - LOOK AT HOW IT MOVES.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.124
    - YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

38:14.126 --> 38:19.396
  YOU'RE SO SET IN YOUR LITTLE
    PERFECT SCOTT HAIR WAYS.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.765
  - FINE, OKAY, CAN WE JUST DO
   SOMETHING A LITTLE EASIER

38:21.767 --> 38:23.199
      TO EASE ME INTO IT?

38:23.201 --> 38:24.234
      - YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

38:24.236 --> 38:25.468
      I THOUGHT WE SHOULD
         PROBABLY START

38:25.470 --> 38:27.771
       WITH NUMBER FOUR.

38:31.543 --> 38:32.542
  - NO, I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

38:32.544 --> 38:33.543
            - YEAH.
             - NO.

38:33.545 --> 38:34.544
- YOU CERTAINLY ARE.

38:34.546 --> 38:35.812
       - NO FUCKING WAY.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.213
   - NO, YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.
             - NO.

38:42.921 --> 38:45.021
- SERIOUSLY, JUST POOP ALREADY.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.790
      - I'M TRYING, OKAY?

38:46.792 --> 38:47.857
  I HAVE A SENSITIVE STOMACH.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.526
- MY GOD.

38:49.528 --> 38:50.694
         - TURN AROUND.

38:50.696 --> 38:51.795
            - WHAT?

38:51.797 --> 38:52.796
         - TURN AROUND.

38:52.798 --> 38:54.197
          - SERIOUSLY?

38:54.199 --> 38:55.465
      THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.933
       - PLUG YOUR EARS.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.768
     - WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
     - IT'S GONNA BE LOUD.

39:02.507 --> 39:03.640
            - SCOTT?

39:03.642 --> 39:04.774
            - SHIT!

39:04.776 --> 39:07.043
         ABORT MISSION!
         ABORT MISSION!

39:07.045 --> 39:08.111
            GO, GO!

39:08.113 --> 39:10.480
         - IT'S LOCKED.
         - JUST GET IN!

39:10.482 --> 39:13.516
    GET THE FUCK IN THE CAR!

39:16.054 --> 39:18.688
- WHY WEREN'T YOU
        INTO POOP STUFF

39:18.690 --> 39:20.657
     WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER?

39:20.659 --> 39:23.493
        - ¶ WE HAVE FUN,
         WE HAVE FUN ¶

39:23.495 --> 39:27.263
   ¶ WE GOT THE SUMMER NIGHTS
      UNDER OUR TONGUES ¶

39:32.270 --> 39:34.671
MY GOD.

39:34.673 --> 39:36.773
          DON'T EVEN.

39:36.775 --> 39:38.174
             WHAT--

39:38.176 --> 39:39.876
            ASSHOLE.

39:50.956 --> 39:54.357
        - ¶ WE HAVE FUN,
         WE HAVE FUN ¶

40:03.702 --> 40:07.070
         ¶ WE HAVE FUN,
         WE HAVE FUN ¶

40:13.745 --> 40:15.645
   - BETTER LATE THAN NEVER,
            I GUESS.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.347
     - YEAH, IT'S SO TRUE.

40:17.349 --> 40:19.949
  - WELL, IT'S HARD TO PREPARE
     FOR IT WHEN IT'S RAPE.

40:22.421 --> 40:23.420
            KIDDING.

40:23.422 --> 40:24.788
    NO, I'M TOTALLY KIDDING.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.656
      YEAH, I DEFINITELY,
     DEFINITELY WANTED IT.

40:28.059 --> 40:29.893
      - ESPECIALLY BECAUSE
      IT WASN'T WITH HIM.

40:29.895 --> 40:30.994
        - SHE'S KIDDING.

40:30.996 --> 40:32.695
         - NO, I'M NOT.

40:32.697 --> 40:35.698
- WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THE BABY.

40:35.700 --> 40:36.766
- THANK YOU, YEAH.

40:36.768 --> 40:39.702
     WE ARE GONNA NEED IT.

40:39.704 --> 40:41.237
 - YOU HAVE A NICE DAY, MA'AM.

40:41.239 --> 40:44.107
          - YEAH, BYE.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.242
             WHOA!

40:50.749 --> 40:51.815
           - NO WAY.

40:51.817 --> 40:52.816
- COME ON.

40:52.818 --> 40:53.817
       DON'T BE A PUSSY.

40:53.819 --> 40:55.051
       - IT'S PERMANENT.

40:55.053 --> 40:55.852
            - YEAH.

40:55.854 --> 40:57.320
   OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, FINE.

40:57.322 --> 40:59.222
      I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

41:02.461 --> 41:03.626
    - I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

41:03.628 --> 41:04.661
        IT'S GONNA HURT.

41:04.663 --> 41:05.962
   - STOP BEING SUCH A BABY.

41:05.964 --> 41:09.532
      - AY, CAN YOU PLEASE
       HURRY THE FUCK UP?

41:09.534 --> 41:11.501
    MY DAUGHTER IS WAITING.

41:15.307 --> 41:17.006
             - GO!

41:19.478 --> 41:20.477
             - SEE?

41:20.479 --> 41:22.445
     THAT WASN'T THAT BAD.

41:22.447 --> 41:25.648
- I GUESS IT WASN'T.

41:27.018 --> 41:29.319
         IS ANYONE ELSE
      LOSING THEIR VISION?

41:33.258 --> 41:35.825
       AT LEAST HE DIDN'T
       PIERCE YOUR DICK.

41:38.230 --> 41:41.798
        - I'M NOT REALLY
       A POT KIND OF GUY.

41:41.800 --> 41:42.866
 - YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S FINE.

41:42.868 --> 41:43.967
     I'LL GET THE CLIPPERS.

41:43.969 --> 41:45.268
- GIVE ME THAT FUCKING BROWNIE.

41:45.270 --> 41:46.536
- MY GOD.

41:46.538 --> 41:48.271
  - OKAY, WHAT IF IT MAKES ME
    ALL CHATTY AND PARANOID

41:48.273 --> 41:49.772
         AND ANNOYING?

41:49.774 --> 41:51.641
- MY GOSH, THEN WE'RE GONNA
   KNOW THAT IT DIDN'T WORK.

41:51.643 --> 41:52.809
      - IS IT GLUTEN-FREE?

41:52.811 --> 41:54.310
        I HAVE A REALLY
       SENSITIVE STOMACH.

41:54.312 --> 41:55.912
- MY GOD, I KNOW YOU HAVE
    A SENSITIVE EVERYTHING.

41:55.914 --> 41:57.881
     YES, IT'S GLUTEN-FREE.

42:02.654 --> 42:04.888
MY GOD.

42:04.890 --> 42:05.989
     - THAT'S FUCKING GOOD.

42:05.991 --> 42:06.990
           - I KNOW.

42:06.992 --> 42:07.924
      - THAT'S REAL GOOD.

42:07.926 --> 42:10.793
       - ISN'T THAT GOOD?

42:10.795 --> 42:12.862
      - I THINK I'M HIGH.

42:16.368 --> 42:19.602
        - ¶ WE HAVE FUN,
         WE HAVE FUN ¶

42:19.604 --> 42:23.907
   ¶ WE GOT THE SUMMER NIGHTS
      UNDER OUR TONGUES ¶

42:27.512 --> 42:29.178
         ARE YOU READY?

42:30.715 --> 42:33.550
        - ¶ WE HAVE FUN,
         WE HAVE FUN ¶

42:33.552 --> 42:37.520
   ¶ WE GOT THE SUMMER NIGHTS
      UNDER OUR TONGUES ¶

42:37.522 --> 42:43.793
              ¶ ¶

42:53.572 --> 42:54.971
     - YOUR CAR BROKE DOWN,

42:54.973 --> 42:57.574
   SO YOU RENTED A PARTY BUS?

42:59.077 --> 43:01.077
         - I DID, YEAH.

43:01.079 --> 43:02.378
     EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

43:02.380 --> 43:04.914
         IT'S JUST NICE
       TO TREAT YOURSELF.

43:04.916 --> 43:06.683
   - QUIT THE BULLSHIT, JOEL.

43:06.685 --> 43:07.850
        WHAT'S GOING ON?

43:07.852 --> 43:10.219
         - NO BULLSHIT.
      NOTHING IS GOING ON,

43:10.221 --> 43:14.157
       BESIDES THE START
    OF OUR GLORIOUS EVENING.

43:14.159 --> 43:17.093
   - NO SEX IN THE CAR, KIDS.

43:17.095 --> 43:18.494
    LAST THING I WANT TO SEE

43:18.496 --> 43:20.730
        IS TWO UNDERAGE,

43:20.732 --> 43:22.165
      SEMI-ETHNIC-LOOKING,

43:22.167 --> 43:24.601
    POSSIBLY NATIVE AMERICAN
           TEENAGERS

43:24.603 --> 43:28.404
      MAKING A MESS ON MY
  BRAND-NEW PLEATHER INTERIOR,

43:28.406 --> 43:31.107
         FORCING ME TO
      LAP, LAP, LAP IT UP

43:31.109 --> 43:34.978
    LIKE A GOLDEN RETRIEVER
       ON A HOT-ASS DAY.

43:36.381 --> 43:38.781
             FUCK.

43:38.783 --> 43:40.650
      - WELL, I FEEL SAFE.

43:40.652 --> 43:41.751
    - DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER.

43:41.753 --> 43:42.852
       I'LL KICK HER ASS.

43:42.854 --> 43:44.320
       I'M HERE FOR YOU.

43:44.322 --> 43:46.022
   - JOEL, I DON'T HAVE TIME
           FOR THIS.

43:46.024 --> 43:48.224
        I HAVE 200 YEARS
      OF EUROPEAN HISTORY

43:48.226 --> 43:49.559
     TO MEMORIZE BY MONDAY.

43:49.561 --> 43:52.195
         - WHICH IS WHY
     I AM GOING TO HELP YOU

43:52.197 --> 43:55.231
     CONNECT THOSE BORING,
         MUNDANE FACTS

43:55.233 --> 43:57.700
       TO IDEAS THAT ARE
        PERSONAL TO YOU.

43:57.702 --> 44:00.203
             - HOW?

44:00.205 --> 44:02.071
       - OKAY, CHAMPAGNE.

44:02.073 --> 44:03.940
      WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
   WHEN YOU DRINK CHAMPAGNE?

44:03.942 --> 44:06.042
    - OLD PEOPLE, HEADACHES.

44:06.044 --> 44:08.177
        - OKAY, PERFECT,
    LET'S GO WITH HEADACHES.

44:08.179 --> 44:09.846
   CHAMPAGNE IS FROM FRANCE.

44:09.848 --> 44:13.950
     IT WAS ORIGINALLY USED
  IN THE CORONATION OF KINGS.

44:13.952 --> 44:18.254
         KING LOUIS XVI
      ALSO GOT A HEADACHE

44:18.256 --> 44:21.257
      WHEN HE WAS BEHEADED
      BY HIS OWN SUBJECTS

44:21.259 --> 44:24.460
     ON JANUARY 21ST, 1793,

44:24.462 --> 44:27.997
 DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.

44:27.999 --> 44:29.232
           - NOT BAD.
            - YEAH.

44:29.234 --> 44:30.566
    - JUST LETTING YOU KNOW

44:30.568 --> 44:33.236
 I'M CHANGING THE ATMOSPHERE UP
             A BIT.

44:37.976 --> 44:39.942
   WHY IS MY ASS GETTING HOT?

44:39.944 --> 44:42.145
        - SEAT WARMERS!

44:42.147 --> 44:44.647
        YOU'RE WELCOME.

44:44.649 --> 44:46.883
        - WELL, ANYWAY,
     A FEW MNEMONIC DEVICES

44:46.885 --> 44:49.318
WON'T BE ENOUGH TO GET ME AN "A"
       IN DRAPER'S CLASS.

44:49.320 --> 44:52.288
        - YOU KNEW ABOUT
       MNEMONIC DEVICES?

44:52.290 --> 44:54.891
      - WHAT I DON'T KNOW
       IS WHAT TO STUDY.

44:54.893 --> 44:58.494
 DRAPER'S CRAMMING WAY TOO MANY
    CHAPTERS INTO ONE TEST.

44:58.496 --> 45:01.664
    - WELL, I DON'T GO BACK
           TO CORNELL

45:01.666 --> 45:06.436
      UNTIL SUNDAY, SO...

45:06.438 --> 45:10.239
    - AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE
 ACTUALLY GONNA HELP ME STUDY.

45:12.343 --> 45:13.943
           PULL OVER.
     - WAIT, WAIT, HOLD ON.

45:13.945 --> 45:15.712
            HOLD ON.

45:18.149 --> 45:19.649
        WOULD THIS HELP?

45:22.887 --> 45:24.821
      - YOU HAVE THE TEST?

45:24.823 --> 45:28.357
- DRAPER USES THE SAME PASSWORD
   FOR ALL HIS SECURE FILES.

45:28.359 --> 45:31.694
     IT'S "ARIANA GRANDE'S
      PUFFY NIPPLES 555."

45:32.831 --> 45:34.797
      WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
         LEAD WITH THIS

45:34.799 --> 45:36.933
 INSTEAD OF THE LAME MNEMONIC?

45:36.935 --> 45:39.569
      - WELL, ONCE YOU HAD
        THE ACTUAL TEST,

45:39.571 --> 45:43.106
      THERE'D BE NO REASON
  FOR YOU TO HANG OUT WITH ME.

45:43.108 --> 45:45.141
            - JOEL.

45:45.143 --> 45:46.676
    I STILL WANT TO HANG OUT
           WITH YOU.

45:46.678 --> 45:50.413
       I JUST DON'T WANT
        TO LEAD YOU ON.

45:50.415 --> 45:52.949
  LIKE, NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN
          BETWEEN US.

45:52.951 --> 45:54.117
            - FUCK!

45:54.119 --> 45:55.718
    - NO, DUH, I KNOW THAT.

45:55.720 --> 45:56.953
            - YEAH.
            - SURE.

45:56.955 --> 46:01.924
       - SERIOUSLY, LIKE,
     IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

46:01.926 --> 46:03.292
   - OKAY, WHAT IF YOU AND I

46:03.294 --> 46:05.328
         WERE STUCK ON
  A DESERTED ISLAND TOGETHER

46:05.330 --> 46:06.696
      AND YOU WERE GETTING
          SUPER HORNY.

46:06.698 --> 46:08.397
    YOU'RE DIDDLING YOURSELF
       EVERY NIGHT, SURE.

46:08.399 --> 46:10.666
    BUT WHAT YOU REALLY NEED
          IS A PENIS.

46:10.668 --> 46:12.602
     NOW, YOU'RE THINKING,
     "I'LL GO ARTIFICIAL."

46:12.604 --> 46:14.403
  YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A DILDO,
  YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A DILDO.

46:14.405 --> 46:15.938
  YOU'RE SEARCHING THE ISLAND.
      YOU CAN'T FIND ONE.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.406
  ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU SEE ME.

46:17.408 --> 46:19.308
       I JUST GAVE MYSELF
 A NICE LITTLE SALTWATER BATH.

46:19.310 --> 46:20.843
         I LOOK GREAT.

46:20.845 --> 46:22.011
      I SHOOT YOU A WINK.

46:22.013 --> 46:23.880
      WHAT ARE MY CHANCES?

46:23.882 --> 46:25.248
   - WELL, IN THAT SCENARIO,

46:25.250 --> 46:27.850
       I GUESS YOU MIGHT
     ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT.

46:38.630 --> 46:40.596
            ALMONT?

46:40.598 --> 46:42.965
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO EAT HERE.

46:42.967 --> 46:46.235
- WHAT A LUCKY GUESS.

46:46.237 --> 46:48.171
- BUT I'M NOT DRESSED FOR THIS.

46:48.173 --> 46:50.406
      - I GOT IT COVERED.

47:08.159 --> 47:09.358
         A-VOOGA-VOOGA!

47:09.360 --> 47:10.860
         HEH-LA-LA-LA!

47:10.862 --> 47:12.261
          YES, PLEASE.

47:12.263 --> 47:13.663
          I'M KIDDING.

47:13.665 --> 47:15.731
         BUT SERIOUSLY,
 YOU LOOK REALLY FUCKING GOOD.

47:15.733 --> 47:19.168
    - JOEL, I CAN'T BELIEVE
     YOU GOT ME THIS DRESS.

47:19.170 --> 47:20.970
  I'VE WANTED IT FOR SO LONG.

47:20.972 --> 47:22.271
           - REALLY?
            NO WAY.

47:22.273 --> 47:23.739
MY GOD, BABY.

47:23.741 --> 47:28.077
      WHO KNEW OUR TASTES
       WERE SO SYMPATICO?

47:28.079 --> 47:29.545
           - JOEL...

47:29.547 --> 47:32.615
     - ONLY ON A DILDO-LESS
   ABANDONED ISLAND, I KNOW.

47:42.026 --> 47:44.227
            - FUCK.

47:44.229 --> 47:46.128
   I THINK I BROKE MY VAGINA.

47:47.732 --> 47:49.232
  YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD AS HELL
       WHEN YOU'RE HIGH?

47:49.234 --> 47:50.333
            - WHAT?

47:50.335 --> 47:51.601
 - MOTHERFUCKIN' FRENCH FRIES.

47:54.806 --> 47:56.205
   I CAN ONLY BURP LIKE THAT
         WHEN I'M HIGH.

47:56.207 --> 47:58.140
           - CLASSY.

47:58.142 --> 47:59.976
             OKAY.

47:59.978 --> 48:02.178
 I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

48:02.180 --> 48:03.312
      - YOU'RE A LESBIAN?

48:03.314 --> 48:04.480
            - WHAT?
              NO.

48:04.482 --> 48:06.649
 WHY WOULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT?

48:06.651 --> 48:08.951
        - YOU'RE THE ONE
   THAT MADE ME BUY CHARLENE.

48:08.953 --> 48:10.853
- MY GOD, YOU NAMED HER?

48:10.855 --> 48:11.988
            - YEAH.

48:11.990 --> 48:14.323
  I EVEN GAVE HER A BACKSTORY.

48:14.325 --> 48:16.726
        SHE'S HAD A HELL
      OF A YEAR, CHARLENE.

48:16.728 --> 48:17.827
        ABUSIVE HUSBAND.

48:17.829 --> 48:20.062
         CHILDREN DIED
       IN A PLANE CRASH.

48:20.064 --> 48:22.265
   WENT TO REHAB A FEW TIMES.

48:22.267 --> 48:23.566
  EVEN TRIED TO KILL HERSELF.

48:23.568 --> 48:24.567
             - AW.

48:24.569 --> 48:25.735
   - BUT SHE'S BOUNCING BACK.

48:25.737 --> 48:28.871
       ONE DAY AT A TIME,
        RIGHT, CHARLENE?

48:28.873 --> 48:31.040
       - YOU'RE NOT HIGH.

48:31.042 --> 48:32.408
            - WHAT?

48:32.410 --> 48:34.210
- THAT'S WHAT I HAD TO TELL YOU.

48:34.212 --> 48:36.879
        I JUST GAVE YOU
      A PLAIN OLD BROWNIE.

48:36.881 --> 48:39.482
    THERE WAS NO WEED IN IT.

48:39.484 --> 48:41.951
   - WAS IT EVEN GLUTEN-FREE?

48:41.953 --> 48:43.085
           YOU BITCH.

48:43.087 --> 48:44.654
          - I'M SORRY.

48:44.656 --> 48:46.255
MY GOD, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
    WHAT THE FUCK GLUTEN IS,

48:46.257 --> 48:47.757
         TO BE HONEST.

48:47.759 --> 48:49.225
 - THE NATION'S LEADING KILLER,
         AT THE MOMENT.

48:49.227 --> 48:50.860
          - BULLSHIT.
            - YEAH.

48:50.862 --> 48:52.161
      OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.

48:52.163 --> 48:54.063
   IF I'M NOT HIGH, THEN HOW
    DO YOU EXPLAIN THE FACT

48:54.065 --> 48:55.998
 THAT I'VE BEEN REALLY FUCKING
  HIGH FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS?

48:56.000 --> 48:57.266
    - IT'S A PLACEBO EFFECT.

48:57.268 --> 48:58.567
YOU HAD THIS PRECONCEIVED NOTION

48:58.569 --> 49:01.070
   OF HOW YOU WOULD RESPOND
        TO THE BROWNIE,

49:01.072 --> 49:02.438
  SO WHEN YOU ATE THE BROWNIE,

49:02.440 --> 49:03.906
           YOUR BRAIN
    AUTOMATICALLY RESPONDED

49:03.908 --> 49:08.010
  AS IF THE CHEMICAL REACTION
    WERE ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

49:08.012 --> 49:09.946
     - YOU FAKE-DRUGGED ME?

49:11.649 --> 49:13.783
       THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
     - IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

49:13.785 --> 49:15.117
        - NO, IT'S NOT.
        IT'S FUCKED UP.

49:15.119 --> 49:16.352
     - WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

49:16.354 --> 49:18.454
          THEN I GUESS
       PAYBACK'S A BITCH,

49:18.456 --> 49:19.455
        AND WE'RE EVEN.

49:19.457 --> 49:20.890
        - EVEN FOR WHAT?

49:20.892 --> 49:22.391
    I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
     THIS FUCKED-UP TO YOU.

49:22.393 --> 49:25.094
       - ARE YOU SERIOUS?

49:25.096 --> 49:26.429
- HERE WE GO.

49:26.431 --> 49:28.698
      - YEAH, HERE WE GO.

49:28.700 --> 49:30.433
YEAH.

49:30.435 --> 49:32.868
      - HEY, I TOOK THAT.

49:32.870 --> 49:35.371
       IT'S ACTUALLY ONE
     OF MY FAVORITE SHOTS.

49:35.373 --> 49:37.273
    I LOVE THE WAY THE LIGHT
        HITS YOUR HAIR.

49:37.275 --> 49:38.507
 SEE THE NATURAL COMPOSITION--

49:38.509 --> 49:39.875
    - FUCK YOUR COMPOSITION.

49:39.877 --> 49:41.711
        THAT WAS MY LIFE
  THAT YOU WERE PHOTOGRAPHING.

49:41.713 --> 49:44.180
  I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
      WHEN THAT WAS TAKEN?

49:44.182 --> 49:45.181
            - PROM.

49:45.183 --> 49:46.615
        - YEAH, EXACTLY.

49:46.617 --> 49:49.185
  THE NIGHT THAT THAT ASSHOLE
        FROM MURRYSVILLE

49:49.187 --> 49:50.486
     WHO TOOK MY VIRGINITY

49:50.488 --> 49:52.288
     DECIDED TO STAND ME UP
          AND TELL ME

49:52.290 --> 49:54.390
    THAT I WAS JUST HIS DUMB
        LITTLE SLAM-PIG

49:54.392 --> 49:57.994
    WHOM HE WOULDN'T BE SEEN
        IN PUBLIC WITH.

49:57.996 --> 49:58.995
        - I DIDN'T KNOW.

49:58.997 --> 50:00.396
    - YEAH, NO, NOBODY KNEW.

50:00.398 --> 50:01.831
       BUT YOU STILL WENT
   AND YOU POSTED THE PICTURE

50:01.833 --> 50:03.599
         LIKE IT'S JUST
      NO BIG FUCKING DEAL,

50:03.601 --> 50:06.102
  BECAUSE YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY
     NO IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE

50:06.104 --> 50:08.004
         TO BE A LOSER.

50:13.044 --> 50:15.911
  - YOU WANT TO KNOW A SECRET?

50:15.913 --> 50:17.613
     THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
          ON A FRIDAY

50:17.615 --> 50:21.384
  I'VE ACTUALLY DONE ANYTHING
       IN, LIKE, MONTHS.

50:21.386 --> 50:23.386
   YOU KNOW WHAT I USUALLY DO
          ON FRIDAYS?

50:23.388 --> 50:25.621
   I'LL WALK YOU THROUGH IT.

50:25.623 --> 50:29.058
     I GET HOME FROM CLASS,
          LAY IN BED,

50:29.060 --> 50:30.426
       AND I MASTURBATE,

50:30.428 --> 50:33.963
        LIKE, VICIOUSLY,

50:33.965 --> 50:35.464
     LIKE, FOR FIVE HOURS,

50:35.466 --> 50:37.033
        LIKE A MARATHON.

50:37.035 --> 50:38.701
GOD!

50:38.703 --> 50:40.169
 - AND THEN I GO TO THE FRIDGE,

50:40.171 --> 50:44.974
   AND I GET A BUNCH OF FOOD,
     AND I EAT MY FEELINGS.

50:44.976 --> 50:47.643
      THEN I GO TO SLEEP.

50:47.645 --> 50:50.012
      EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT.

50:52.150 --> 50:54.450
        I HATE COLLEGE.

50:54.452 --> 50:55.785
       I FUCKING HATE IT.

50:55.787 --> 50:56.986
  I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.

50:56.988 --> 50:57.987
       I HATE MY CLASSES.

50:57.989 --> 50:59.055
     I HATE MY PROFESSORS.

50:59.057 --> 51:01.524
       THEY SUCK THE FUN
       OUT OF EVERYTHING.

51:01.526 --> 51:02.725
    I'M FAILING EVERY CLASS.

51:02.727 --> 51:04.627
       I'M FAILING YOGA.

51:04.629 --> 51:07.763
     HOW DO YOU FAIL YOGA?

51:07.765 --> 51:09.865
  YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORST PART
       OF EVERYTHING IS?

51:09.867 --> 51:13.436
   THIS WHOLE TIME WE'VE BEEN
   HAVING THIS CONVERSATION,

51:13.438 --> 51:15.171
     ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
       IS HOW HAPPY I AM

51:15.173 --> 51:17.773
       TO BE IN THIS GYM,

51:17.775 --> 51:20.576
           BECAUSE...

51:20.578 --> 51:23.145
   I FUCKING MISS HIGH SCHOOL
            SO BAD.

51:24.882 --> 51:29.118
       - AND WE WILL CUE
      THE CW SOUNDTRACK...

51:29.120 --> 51:30.953
          RIGHT THERE.

51:30.955 --> 51:31.787
       - I MEAN, REALLY?

51:31.789 --> 51:32.988
 WE WERE HAVING A NICE MOMENT.

51:32.990 --> 51:36.425
     YOU GOT TO BE A BITCH?

51:36.427 --> 51:39.228
    - NO, HONESTLY, THOUGH,

51:39.230 --> 51:40.796
I THINK THAT HEATHER DUMPING YOU

51:40.798 --> 51:45.468
   IS PROBABLY THE BEST THING
   THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

51:45.470 --> 51:46.469
        THINK ABOUT IT.

51:46.471 --> 51:48.003
       SHE WAS GIVING YOU

51:48.005 --> 51:50.206
       A REASON TO RESIST
     YOUR NEW ENVIRONMENT.

51:50.208 --> 51:53.075
  SHE WAS GIVING YOU AN EXCUSE
          TO HATE IT.

51:53.077 --> 51:55.478
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE SCHOOL
  A WHOLE HELL OF A LOT BETTER

51:55.480 --> 51:57.513
       WHEN YOU GO BACK.

51:59.684 --> 52:01.750
    OKAY, SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,
  WE NEED TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW,

52:01.752 --> 52:03.719
     BECAUSE I CAN'T STAND
     THIS GYM MUCH LONGER.

52:03.721 --> 52:05.521
       I PROMISED MYSELF
 THE ONLY WAY I WOULD COME BACK

52:05.523 --> 52:07.123
IS IF I HAD TELEKINETIC POWERS,

52:07.125 --> 52:10.426
AND THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED TODAY,
          SO LET'S GO.

52:10.428 --> 52:12.628
 - ALL RIGHT, BUT I'M DRIVING.

52:12.630 --> 52:13.729
            - WHAT?
              WHY?

52:13.731 --> 52:15.931
   - I KNOW COOL PLACES TOO.

52:19.036 --> 52:21.570
       - YOU'RE NOT HIGH,
   BUT YOU STILL CAN'T CATCH.

52:28.279 --> 52:29.578
         - DAD'S DEAD!

52:29.580 --> 52:31.046
          DAD'S DEAD.

52:31.048 --> 52:33.115
 YO, MY DAD'S DEAD, DAD'S DEAD.

52:33.117 --> 52:35.951
   - I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LIKE
 <i> WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE?</i>

52:35.953 --> 52:37.586
        I THOUGHT I WAS
         THE ONLY ONE.

52:37.588 --> 52:38.854
     - ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

52:38.856 --> 52:40.823
        OKAY, LITERALLY,
     THE ONLY THING HOTTER

52:40.825 --> 52:42.992
     THAN LEONARDO DICAPRIO
           IS, LIKE,

52:42.994 --> 52:46.762
  A RETARDED LEONARDO DICAPRIO
 WEARING A FUCKING SEXY DIAPER.

52:46.764 --> 52:50.199
- THAT SHIT
        MAKES ME SO WET.

52:51.602 --> 52:53.936
          OKAY, GOOD.

52:53.938 --> 52:59.575
        HEY, DO YOU WANT
    TO GET RETARDED WITH ME?

52:59.577 --> 53:01.076
         - WHAT'S THAT?

53:01.078 --> 53:02.611
         - IT'S ETHYL.

53:02.613 --> 53:05.848
     IT'S LIKE MOLLY MIXED
        WITH BRAN MUFFIN

53:05.850 --> 53:07.416
 AND PRUNE JUICE OR SOMETHING.

53:07.418 --> 53:08.417
  I HEAR IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE--

53:08.419 --> 53:09.885
         - TOTES CRAY?

53:09.887 --> 53:12.788
           - EXACTLY.

53:12.790 --> 53:15.424
         I THOUGHT THAT
     YOU LOVED THIS STUFF.

53:15.426 --> 53:19.094
- WHAT GAVE YOU THAT IMPRESSION?

53:19.096 --> 53:20.529
             - I--

53:20.531 --> 53:22.331
   - YOU FACEBOOK STALKED ME.

53:22.333 --> 53:23.632
            - WHAT?

53:23.634 --> 53:25.367
       - LACY POSTED THAT
    STUPID SHIT ON MY WALL,

53:25.369 --> 53:26.535
      LIKE, SIX HOURS AGO,

53:26.537 --> 53:27.770
    ABOUT GETTING FUCKED UP
           ON ETHYL.

53:27.772 --> 53:28.804
      - WHAT IS FACEBOOK?

53:28.806 --> 53:29.805
       IS THAT A WEBSITE?

53:29.807 --> 53:31.240
  - IN FACT, THIS WHOLE NIGHT

53:31.242 --> 53:33.676
 HAS BEEN A LITTLE TOO PERFECT,
           HASN'T IT?

53:33.678 --> 53:35.411
   THE RESTAURANT, THE DRESS,

53:35.413 --> 53:37.646
 OUR--OUR NONSTOP CONVERSATION.

53:37.648 --> 53:39.315
 - THE CONVERSATION WAS ALL ME.

53:39.317 --> 53:40.382
           - REALLY?

53:40.384 --> 53:41.884
   BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF WEIRD

53:41.886 --> 53:45.321
THAT ALL OF YOUR FAVORITE THINGS
     ARE THE SAME AS MINE.

53:45.323 --> 53:48.023
       DO YOU EVEN LIKE
 <i> WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE?</i>

53:48.025 --> 53:49.258
        - THAT WAS TRUE.

53:49.260 --> 53:51.694
 THAT FAT MOM BEING LIT ON FIRE
          AT THE END?

53:51.696 --> 53:52.962
       FUCKING BEAUTIFUL!

53:52.964 --> 53:54.763
           KILLED ME.

53:57.969 --> 53:59.468
          OKAY, FINE.

53:59.470 --> 54:01.503
   FINE, ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT?

54:01.505 --> 54:02.705
      WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

54:02.707 --> 54:04.306
      I WANTED TO GIVE YOU
        A SPECIAL TIME.

54:04.308 --> 54:05.641
        IS THAT A CRIME?
        AM I IN TROUBLE?

54:05.643 --> 54:07.009
   ARE YOU GONNA YELL AT ME?

54:07.011 --> 54:08.944
    I MEAN, I GOT ONE CHANCE
     TO TAKE YOU ON A DATE,

54:08.946 --> 54:10.412
AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE--

54:10.414 --> 54:13.282
          - I SAID NO.

54:13.284 --> 54:17.386
   I THINK IT'S REALLY SWEET
    YOU TRIED TO IMPRESS ME.

54:17.388 --> 54:18.387
           - YOU DO?

54:18.389 --> 54:19.388
            - YEAH.

54:19.390 --> 54:20.556
      I MEAN, NOBODY CARES

54:20.558 --> 54:22.524
       ABOUT WHAT I THINK
        OR WHAT I LIKE.

54:22.526 --> 54:23.859
     - BUT I DON'T GET IT.

54:23.861 --> 54:25.160
         IF YOU'RE NOT
     INTO THIS ETHYL STUFF,

54:25.162 --> 54:27.263
    THEN WHY DID YOU "LIKE"
          LACY'S POST?

54:27.265 --> 54:30.266
         - I DON'T LIKE
    HALF THE STUFF I "LIKE."

54:30.268 --> 54:33.269
        IT'S JUST EASIER
  TO GO ALONG WITH EVERYBODY.

54:37.642 --> 54:40.175
     THANK YOU FOR DINNER.

54:40.177 --> 54:43.245
    IT WAS REALLY RETARDED,

54:43.247 --> 54:46.615
         IN A GOOD WAY.

54:46.617 --> 54:50.085
- WELL, I'VE GOT ONE MORE STOP.

54:50.087 --> 54:52.254
       AND I PROMISE THIS
     IS GONNA BE SOMETHING

54:52.256 --> 54:54.923
    YOU'LL ACTUALLY "LIKE."

55:00.498 --> 55:02.564
       I GOT THREE WORDS:

55:02.566 --> 55:05.801
          DI-A-RRHEA.

55:05.803 --> 55:08.203
          AM I RIGHT?

55:08.205 --> 55:09.672
           SLAM DUNK!

55:11.375 --> 55:13.008
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

55:13.010 --> 55:16.945
 - ALMOST THERE, DOWN THE STEPS
  TO YOUR DEEP, DARK BASEMENT

55:16.947 --> 55:19.214
  WHERE YOU'LL CHOP MY BODY UP
     INTO A MILLION PIECES,

55:19.216 --> 55:20.783
       REVEAL THAT YOU'RE
        A SERIAL KILLER,

55:20.785 --> 55:23.919
AND WEAR MY SKIN UNTIL YOU DIE?

55:23.921 --> 55:26.722
    - NO, BUT I WILL DO THAT
      ON OUR SECOND DATE.

55:26.724 --> 55:28.057
- GREAT.

55:28.059 --> 55:29.725
     - THIS IS A LITTLE BIT
         MORE AWESOME.

55:36.367 --> 55:37.599
           SERIOUSLY?

55:37.601 --> 55:39.001
      - YEAH, COOL, RIGHT?

55:39.003 --> 55:41.370
- MY GOD, HOW DID YOU
       EVEN GET IN HERE?

55:41.372 --> 55:42.838
     - I HAVE CONNECTIONS.

55:42.840 --> 55:46.141
    SECURITY GUARD WAS IN MY
  COMMUNITY PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS.

55:47.712 --> 55:51.280
      I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
        EVEN BEEN HERE.

55:51.282 --> 55:52.448
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.

55:52.450 --> 55:55.451
     - I USED TO COME HERE,
      LIKE, EVERY SUNDAY.

55:55.453 --> 55:56.652
         - REALLY, YOU?

55:56.654 --> 55:57.886
   'CAUSE I NEVER PEGGED YOU

55:57.888 --> 55:59.755
      FOR THE PROTOTYPICAL
         FOOTBALL FAN.

55:59.757 --> 56:00.856
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.

56:00.858 --> 56:01.990
   - NO, I LOVE THE FOOTBALL.

56:01.992 --> 56:03.625
- YOU LOVE <i> THE</i> FOOTBALL?

56:03.627 --> 56:05.828
- YEAH.
         - YES.

56:05.830 --> 56:07.763
    WELL, MR. FOOTBALL MAN,

56:07.765 --> 56:11.900
  HOW MANY POINTS DOES ONE GET
        FOR A TOUCHDOWN?

56:11.902 --> 56:14.336
- HERE, WAIT,
         LET ME THINK.

56:14.338 --> 56:16.205
- NICE, GOOD.

56:16.207 --> 56:17.473
         YEAH, AWESOME.

56:17.475 --> 56:18.741
- WAIT, ALMOST GOT IT.

56:18.743 --> 56:20.509
        - THAT'S THE ONE
       I WAS LOOKING FOR.

56:20.511 --> 56:22.111
         PERFECT FORM.

56:22.113 --> 56:23.512
           WELL DONE.

56:23.514 --> 56:25.280
   - ALL RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW
    ANYTHING ABOUT FOOTBALL.

56:25.282 --> 56:26.315
       BUT WHAT I DO KNOW

56:26.317 --> 56:28.150
        IS THEY GOT SOME
     BOMB-ASS HOTDOGS HERE.

56:28.152 --> 56:30.619
     AND THE BATHROOMS ARE
 WAY CLEANER THAN YOU'D EXPECT.

56:30.621 --> 56:31.887
- CLASSY.
            - YEAH.

56:31.889 --> 56:33.188
       - CLASSY STADIUM.

56:33.190 --> 56:34.556
       - YEAH, WE USED TO
    COME HERE EVERY WEEKEND.

56:34.558 --> 56:35.858
     MY MOM WAS A BIG FAN,

56:35.860 --> 56:39.395
      SO THIS WAS USUALLY
       THE FAMILY OUTING.

56:43.000 --> 56:48.904
  - I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU TALK
     ABOUT YOUR MOM BEFORE.

56:48.906 --> 56:51.807
     IT WAS CANCER, RIGHT?

56:51.809 --> 56:53.642
        - NO, ACTUALLY,
     SHE WAS A SAGITTARIUS.

56:53.644 --> 56:55.377
        WHAT'S YOUR MOM?

57:00.050 --> 57:02.751
     YEAH, SHE PASSED AWAY
        A FEW YEARS AGO.

57:02.753 --> 57:04.219
      CAN WE ACTUALLY SKIP
           THIS WHOLE

57:04.221 --> 57:05.921
        "HOW DID IT FEEL
     WHEN SHE DIED?" THING?

57:05.923 --> 57:07.489
     I HAVE DONE THAT WITH
  SO MANY GUIDANCE COUNSELORS.

57:07.491 --> 57:08.424
           I AM GOOD.

57:08.426 --> 57:09.892
      - YEAH, NO, I MEAN,

57:09.894 --> 57:11.393
  I WAS ALREADY GETTING BORED,

57:11.395 --> 57:13.595
       SO I'M REALLY GLAD
     THAT WE'RE MOVING ON.

57:13.597 --> 57:14.730
       THANK YOU SO MUCH.

57:14.732 --> 57:17.599
           - AWESOME.

57:17.601 --> 57:20.235
          - SO, UM...

57:20.237 --> 57:23.772
     WHAT WOULD YOU PREFER
         TO TALK ABOUT?

57:23.774 --> 57:26.275
          - ACTUALLY,
    YOU KNOW THE OTHER NIGHT

57:26.277 --> 57:28.577
         WHEN YOU SAID
       IT WAS "JUST SEX"?

57:29.880 --> 57:33.549
  - WAS THAT, LIKE "JUST SEX"
           ONE TIME,

57:33.551 --> 57:37.653
OR COULD WE JUST HAVE "JUST SEX"

57:37.655 --> 57:40.222
          JUST AGAIN?

57:40.224 --> 57:42.424
  - FROM THE DEAD MOM TO SEX.

57:42.426 --> 57:46.795
  THAT IS A VERY IMPRESSIVELY
   SMOOTH SEGUE THERE, ROMEO.

57:46.797 --> 57:49.231
- I'D SAY IT'S A TOUCHDOWN.

57:49.233 --> 57:50.332
        - YEAH, AWESOME.

57:50.334 --> 57:51.900
IT'S NOT REAL WITHOUT THE DANCE.

57:51.902 --> 57:53.202
       OKAY, THERE IT IS.

57:53.204 --> 57:56.872
   THERE YOU GO, YEAH, NICE.

57:56.874 --> 57:59.007
    - NO, SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,

57:59.009 --> 58:01.343
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION.

58:09.553 --> 58:10.552
- SHIT!

58:10.554 --> 58:11.920
      SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.

58:11.922 --> 58:13.555
 NO, I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE,
        LIKE, ROMANTIC.

58:13.557 --> 58:14.590
MY GOD, ARE YOU OKAY?

58:14.592 --> 58:15.591
    - IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

58:15.593 --> 58:16.592
          - YOU OKAY?

58:16.594 --> 58:17.593
    - I THINK I TASTE BLOOD.

58:17.595 --> 58:18.594
- SHIT.

58:18.596 --> 58:19.795
- I THINK I TASTE BLOOD.

58:24.735 --> 58:28.403
    - ALL RIGHT, WE'RE HERE.

58:28.405 --> 58:30.472
      - SO YOU BROUGHT ME
           TO A PLACE

58:30.474 --> 58:34.209
          I'VE BEEN TO
    A BILLION TIMES BEFORE?

58:34.211 --> 58:35.944
           - HIT IT.

58:39.717 --> 58:43.785
    - ¶ WHATEVER IT TAKES ¶

58:43.787 --> 58:45.554
        ¶ YOU KNOW I CAN
       MAKE IT THROUGH ¶

58:45.556 --> 58:47.856
          -<i> DEGRASSI?</i>

58:47.858 --> 58:50.659
   THAT WAS MY FAVORITE SHOW
          GROWING UP.

58:50.661 --> 58:52.261
           - I KNOW.

58:52.263 --> 58:54.963
  YOU PERFORMED THE THEME SONG
AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL TALENT SHOW

58:54.965 --> 58:56.398
     THREE YEARS IN A ROW.

58:56.400 --> 58:59.535
     - MY FAVORITE EPISODE
    IS WHEN JIMMY GETS SHOT.

58:59.537 --> 59:03.138
 NO, WHERE EMMA GETS GONORRHEA
         IN HER THROAT.

59:03.140 --> 59:04.172
              NO!

59:04.174 --> 59:06.775
          WHEN SPINNER
     GETS BALLSACK CANCER.

59:06.777 --> 59:08.610
MY GOD, SO SAD.

59:08.612 --> 59:11.413
        I ALMOST CRIED.

59:11.415 --> 59:14.583
       - JESUS, THAT SHOW
  IS, LIKE, REALLY FUCKED UP.

59:14.585 --> 59:15.884
           - I KNOW.

59:15.886 --> 59:19.454
         IT GOES THERE.

59:22.259 --> 59:24.026
     - ALL RIGHT, AND WE'RE
       GONNA SLOW IT DOWN

59:24.028 --> 59:27.162
   WITH THE AFTER-THE-CREDITS
            VERSION.

59:29.166 --> 59:32.134
- WE HAVE TO DANCE.

59:32.136 --> 59:33.902
  - I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DANCE.

59:33.904 --> 59:36.271
- YES, YOU DO KNOW HOW TO DANCE.

59:36.273 --> 59:37.706
            COME ON.

59:37.708 --> 59:38.707
      PUT YOUR HANDS HERE.

59:38.709 --> 59:39.875
            - OKAY.

59:39.877 --> 59:41.743
   - AND THEN I PUT MY HANDS
            UP HERE.

59:41.745 --> 59:43.579
     AND NOW WE JUST SWAY.

59:43.581 --> 59:44.580
            - SWAY.

59:44.582 --> 59:46.181
         - SWAY, SWAY.

59:46.183 --> 59:47.015
            - OKAY.

59:47.017 --> 59:48.617
       - MOVE YOUR HIPS.

59:48.619 --> 59:50.152
       - BUT I DON'T WANT
     TO STEP ON YOUR FEET.

59:50.154 --> 59:51.920
    - YOU'RE NOT GONNA STEP
          ON MY FEET.

59:51.922 --> 59:52.921
            CHILLAX.

59:52.923 --> 59:54.089
     - BUT IT COULD HAPPEN.

59:54.091 --> 59:56.091
    - THAT'S GOOD, JOEL-SKI.

59:56.093 --> 59:57.092
        - YOU'RE LYING.

59:57.094 --> 59:58.093
      I KNOW YOU'RE LYING.

59:58.095 --> 01:00:00.028
        - I'M NOT LYING.

01:00:25.723 --> 01:00:27.255
- MY GOD.

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:28.590
 THIS IS JUST LIKE THE EPISODE
      WHERE CLARE LEFT ELI

01:00:28.592 --> 01:00:31.193
     BECAUSE SHE FOUND OUT
        HE WAS BIPOLAR.

01:00:57.855 --> 01:00:59.454
        - WHAT'S WRONG?

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:01.757
           - NOTHING.

01:01:01.759 --> 01:01:02.891
         - YOU NERVOUS?

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:04.393
             - NO.

01:01:04.395 --> 01:01:05.894
    - I MEAN, WE'VE KIND OF
   ALREADY DONE THIS BEFORE.

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:06.995
  - YEAH, IT'S JUST THIS TIME

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:09.731
    I'M NOT COVERED IN PUKE.

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:17.739
      - YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL,
         YOU KNOW THAT?

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:21.677
        YOU ALWAYS WERE.

01:01:39.897 --> 01:01:41.730
            - SHIT.

01:01:45.536 --> 01:01:48.170
MY GOD.

01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:51.406
   SHIT, IS IT 6:00 ALREADY?

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:53.008
 I PROMISED I WOULD HELP SET UP

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.777
        FOR MY SISTER'S
       ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:58.847
HEY, DOES THIS SHIRT SAY, LIKE,

01:01:58.849 --> 01:02:01.550
   "I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE,
   AND I DON'T GIVE A FUCK"?

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:02.350
            - YEAH.

01:02:02.352 --> 01:02:05.320
      - AWESOME, PERFECT.

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:08.156
  YOU CAN COME IF YOU WANT TO.

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:09.357
           - REALLY?

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:11.026
           ALL RIGHT,
   I LOVE ENGAGEMENT PARTIES.

01:02:11.028 --> 01:02:16.264
 - ALL RIGHT, LET'S NOT MAKE ME
      REGRET FUCKING YOU.

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:18.967
- HEY, I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT.

01:02:18.969 --> 01:02:20.202
      ME AND YOU SHOULD GO
        ON A ROAD TRIP.

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:22.237
 - WHAT, LIKE, OVER CHRISTMAS?

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:24.005
     - NO, LIKE, THIS WEEK.

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:26.408
  - I HAVE CLASSES ON MONDAY.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.744
      - WELL, THEN YOU CAN
        JUST SKIP THEM.

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:31.713
           - I CAN'T,
      AND I DON'T WANT TO.

01:02:31.715 --> 01:02:35.751
 - COME ON, WE CAN GO SOMEWHERE
   AWESOME, YOU KNOW, LIKE...

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:37.319
           KENTUCKY.

01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:39.955
    YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOUR DOG THERE.

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:42.290
    - THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC,

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:45.293
  BUT DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME

01:02:45.295 --> 01:02:48.697
      THAT YOU WERE, LIKE,
    FLUNKING OUT OF SCHOOL?

01:02:48.699 --> 01:02:52.000
     - I DON'T REALLY WANT
      TO GO BACK ANYWAYS.

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:55.203
 - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:57.773
  - I JUST WANT TO STAY HERE,
           YOU KNOW?

01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:59.407
    WHY AM I GONNA GO BACK?

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:02.077
   I MEAN, WE'VE GOT ALL THIS
   RANDOM SHIT IN YOUR TRUNK

01:03:02.079 --> 01:03:03.512
     THAT WE CAN PLAY WITH.

01:03:03.514 --> 01:03:06.414
       WE COULD HAVE SEX
  IN PARKING LOTS EVERY NIGHT.

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:08.817
         - OKAY, YEAH,
      I REALLY CAN'T TELL

01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:11.720
    IF YOU'RE BEING SERIOUS
       OR NOT RIGHT NOW.

01:03:11.722 --> 01:03:13.488
            - DEAD.

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:14.823
             - NO.

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:17.225
 - COME ON, YOU ALREADY FORGET
    ABOUT THE FUCK IT LIST?

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:18.493
        LET GO A LITTLE.

01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:20.495
     - WOW, YOU COMPLETELY
         MISINTERPRETED

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:22.497
       THE ENTIRE PURPOSE
       OF THAT EXERCISE.

01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:25.267
- ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT I WANT
   TO HANG OUT WITH YOU MORE.

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:27.636
     SO WHY IS THAT SO BAD?

01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:31.239
  - YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE
     LESSONS FROM THE LIST

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:33.775
       AND APPLY THEM TO
   YOUR NEW LIFE IN NEW YORK.

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:36.111
        YOU'RE SUPPOSED
     TO KICK ASS IN SCHOOL

01:03:36.113 --> 01:03:37.546
      AND MEET NEW PEOPLE

01:03:37.548 --> 01:03:39.281
          AND HAVE ALL
    THESE GREAT EXPERIENCES.

01:03:39.283 --> 01:03:40.482
 YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO RETREAT

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:43.051
        BACK TO WHATEVER
        IS EASY FOR YOU.

01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:44.386
           - COME ON.

01:03:44.388 --> 01:03:46.588
     YOU WEREN'T THAT EASY.

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:48.323
        - REALLY, DUDE?

01:03:50.894 --> 01:03:51.927
   - COME ON, I WAS KIDDING.

01:03:51.929 --> 01:03:52.961
          - NO, IT'S--

01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:53.962
   YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S FINE.

01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:56.031
           IT'S FINE.

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:57.232
  - CAN WE NOT END ON A FIGHT?

01:03:57.234 --> 01:03:58.300
  - WE'RE NOT HAVING A FIGHT.

01:03:58.302 --> 01:03:59.835
     JUST, LIKE, CHILL OUT.

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:01.269
    I JUST HAVE TO GET BACK,

01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:02.771
        SO JUST TELL ME
   HOW TO GET TO YOUR HOUSE.

01:04:02.773 --> 01:04:04.039
             - WHY?

01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:06.575
    I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING
  TO YOUR HOUSE FOR THE PARTY.

01:04:06.577 --> 01:04:11.913
   - I--YEAH, I GOT TO CHECK
   AND MAKE SURE THAT'S COOL.

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:14.749
 - YOU CAN JUST TAKE ROUTE 28.

01:04:14.751 --> 01:04:16.451
            - OKAY.

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:24.893
            - WELL,
   THAT'S THE LAST ONE, BOSS.

01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:26.895
- THAT'S IT?

01:04:26.897 --> 01:04:28.630
  WELL, I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD GO

01:04:28.632 --> 01:04:31.066
       BEFORE CRACKHEADS
      AND HOOKERS MOVE IN.

01:04:35.606 --> 01:04:37.038
          - TOO LATE.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.940
      - HEY, YOU MADE IT.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.826
            - SO...

01:04:57.828 --> 01:04:58.927
      HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

01:04:58.929 --> 01:05:00.829
     DID YOU KISS ANY DUDES

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:04.132
    AND THEN RUN AWAY CRYING
   AND LEAVING THEM STRANDED

01:05:04.134 --> 01:05:06.635
 WITH A SHITTY TWO-PERSON BAND

01:05:06.637 --> 01:05:10.005
  TO TALK ABOUT THAT ONE TIME
    THEY ALMOST GOT SIGNED?

01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:11.706
      - JOEL, I LIKE YOU.

01:05:12.843 --> 01:05:13.942
     COULD HAVE FOOLED ME.

01:05:13.944 --> 01:05:14.943
         - AS A FRIEND.

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:16.411
- PERFECT.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:18.380
      - I'M SORRY I DON'T
    LIKE YOU MORE THAN THAT.

01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:19.848
         I WISH I DID.

01:05:19.850 --> 01:05:21.316
     UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME,

01:05:21.318 --> 01:05:23.451
   I'M ATTRACTED TO MUSCULAR,

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:26.588
      MORE CONVENTIONALLY
        ATTRACTIVE MEN.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:27.889
       - THAT'S NOT NICE.

01:05:27.891 --> 01:05:29.090
      WHY ARE YOU SAYING--

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:30.592
     IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE
     MAKING ME FEEL BETTER?

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:31.927
   - I ALMOST SLEPT WITH YOU
          LAST NIGHT.

01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:34.596
     - AGAIN, NOT MAKING ME
          FEEL BETTER.

01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:37.332
      - JOEL, I WANTED YOU
        TO BE MY FRIEND.

01:05:37.334 --> 01:05:38.600
       I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:40.802
      I DON'T HAVE ANYONE
          TO TALK TO.

01:05:40.804 --> 01:05:42.203
            - WHAT?
  WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:05:42.205 --> 01:05:44.139
       YOU'RE, LIKE, YOU.

01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:45.640
     YOU'RE SUPER POPULAR.

01:05:45.642 --> 01:05:48.076
      - YEAH, WITH PEOPLE
   I'M NEVER GOING TO TALK TO

01:05:48.078 --> 01:05:49.744
        ONCE I GRADUATE.

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:53.415
     MANDY, STACY, AND LACY
        ARE TOTES RETAR.

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:56.284
          MY BROTHER'S
    A SELF-ABSORBED ASSHOLE.

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:59.854
      EVEN MY DAD PREFERS
    TALKING TO YOU OVER ME.

01:05:59.856 --> 01:06:01.923
       I FEEL COMFORTABLE
       AROUND YOU, JOEL.

01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:04.225
       YOU LISTEN TO ME,
      AND FOR SOME REASON,

01:06:04.227 --> 01:06:06.561
   YOU LIKE ME FOR WHO I AM.

01:06:06.563 --> 01:06:08.330
         I DIDN'T WANT
     TO THROW THAT ALL AWAY

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:10.932
   BY HAVING MEANINGLESS SEX.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:14.569
       AM I MAKING SENSE?

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.306
           THANK YOU.

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:19.541
         I FELT SO BAD.

01:06:19.543 --> 01:06:21.910
   I'M SORRY I ABANDONED YOU.

01:06:21.912 --> 01:06:23.044
          - IT'S OKAY.

01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:24.479
          TO BE FAIR,
  YOU WARNED ME AHEAD OF TIME

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:26.548
  THAT YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:28.850
  - WELL, YOU WERE PRETTY HARD
         TO DISCOURAGE.

01:06:28.852 --> 01:06:29.951
           - I KNOW.

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:31.419
     I GUESS I JUST WANTED
         MY FIRST TIME

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:33.922
  TO BE WITH SOMEONE SPECIAL.

01:06:33.924 --> 01:06:34.923
         - FIRST TIME?

01:06:34.925 --> 01:06:36.157
             - NO.

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:37.659
      I MEAN MY 17TH TIME.

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:40.562
     I WANTED MY 17TH TIME
  TO BE WITH SOMEONE SPECIAL,

01:06:40.564 --> 01:06:42.998
        BECAUSE THAT'S--
    THAT'S MY LUCKY NUMBER.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.933
         THAT, AND 69,

01:06:44.935 --> 01:06:47.836
     BECAUSE OF...ORAL SEX.

01:06:47.838 --> 01:06:50.372
  - THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DO IT.

01:06:51.408 --> 01:06:53.274
   PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYONE.

01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:54.943
   - WHAT ABOUT YOUR TUMBLR?

01:06:54.945 --> 01:06:56.611
       - I MADE THAT UP.

01:06:56.613 --> 01:06:59.881
   ONLY BOOBS I'VE EVER SEEN
         ARE MY MOM'S.

01:07:01.151 --> 01:07:03.184
             JOEL!

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:04.352
           I'M SORRY.

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:05.387
  I'M SORRY; THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

01:07:05.389 --> 01:07:06.454
          - NO, IT IS.

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:07.722
MY MOM'S TITTIES ARE HILARIOUS.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:14.362
      WELL, LUCKY FOR YOU,
       WE'RE FRIENDS NOW.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:16.398
- SHOULD WE GET BRACELETS?

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.734
        - I WAS THINKING
       I'D GET YOU LAID.

01:07:19.736 --> 01:07:21.736
   FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS
         STAY VIRGINS,

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:23.271
  AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW A TRIO

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:28.009
     OF OVERLY PROMISCUOUS,
 EASILY IMPRESSIONABLE LADIES.

01:07:28.011 --> 01:07:29.978
     - SO YOU'RE JUST GOING
       TO PIMP THEM OUT?

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.413
            REALLY?

01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:33.481
             - YES.

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:34.983
 - OKAY, I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

01:07:34.985 --> 01:07:36.251
- JOEL-SKI.

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:37.452
- JANIE.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:40.121
            - SORRY.

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:42.457
        I DIDN'T--OKAY.

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:51.800
- AT LEAST TURN OFF
   YOUR SEND RECEIPT FEATURE.

01:07:51.802 --> 01:07:55.270
        I MEAN, COME ON!

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:56.838
   - HEY, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.475
       TO BE AT SHAREEF'S
      CRAZY RAGER TONIGHT?

01:08:00.477 --> 01:08:01.876
       YEAH, I KNOW SHIT.

01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:05.313
  - NAH, I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

01:08:05.315 --> 01:08:06.414
- COME ON.

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.549
  GO ON OUT AND HAVE SOME FUN.

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:08.917
      JUST DON'T DO MARIA.

01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:09.951
             - WHO?

01:08:09.953 --> 01:08:11.086
            - MARIA.

01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:12.320
          IT'S MOLLY.

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:13.354
      LITTLE BIT OF CHILI,

01:08:13.356 --> 01:08:14.889
 LITTLE BIT OF CAYENNE PEPPER.

01:08:14.891 --> 01:08:16.491
         <i> MUY CALIENTE.</i>

01:08:16.493 --> 01:08:19.194
    I TOLD YOU I KNOW SHIT.

01:08:21.031 --> 01:08:25.033
     all: CHUG, CHUG, CHUG,
 CHUG, CHUG, CHUG, CHUG, CHUG!

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:27.435
        TORI THE WHORIE?

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:28.770
     - DON'T CALL HER THAT.

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:32.407
       - I CANNOT BELIEVE
     YOU HAD SEX WITH HER.

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:34.408
        - WHAT THE FUCK!

01:08:34.411 --> 01:08:35.844
             - OOH.

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:36.877
             - HER?

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.279
       YOU'RE TELLING ME
        THAT YOU HAD SEX

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:40.281
  WITH THAT BUTTER-EVERYTHING?

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.117
 - DID SOMEBODY SAY, "BUTTER"?

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:44.953
      WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?

01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:45.987
             - HEY!

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:49.023
         MENTAL ILLNESS
    IS NOTHING TO LAUGH AT.

01:08:49.024 --> 01:08:50.725
         IT'S PERSONAL!

01:08:53.697 --> 01:08:56.096
  - THAT WAS FUCKING AWESOME!

01:08:58.268 --> 01:08:59.934
        - HEATHER, STOP.

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:02.237
 - YEAH, YOU BETTER RUN, BITCH!

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:04.139
 - I DIDN'T HAVE SEX WITH HER.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.040
         - YOU DIDN'T?

01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:10.145
SCOTTY,
     I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

01:09:10.147 --> 01:09:11.979
        FOR REALS, BOO.

01:09:11.982 --> 01:09:14.716
         LET'S GO BACK
    TO THE WAY THINGS WERE.

01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:26.961
    - I'M NOT AFRAID TO BEAT
  THE SHIT OUT OF YOU, EITHER,

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:28.897
           MEGATRON.

01:09:37.474 --> 01:09:39.908
- STAN,
     THANK YOU FOR COMING.

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:41.809
        - STAN THE MAN.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.944
    - ZACK, HOW NICE OF YOU
          TO JOIN US.

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:45.747
         - ZACK ATTACK.

01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:47.881
          - JENNIFER,
      DID YOU LOSE WEIGHT?

01:09:47.884 --> 01:09:51.286
     - NO, NO, SHE DIDN'T.

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:52.987
             WHOO.

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:56.424
     - SO YOU REALLY THINK
   JANIE'S GONNA HOOK IT UP?

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:57.492
          - HELL YEAH.

01:09:57.494 --> 01:09:59.294
     SHE GAVE ME HER WORD.

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:00.428
    FINALLY GONNA GET TO...

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:03.631
      ¶ SEE SOME AREOLAS ¶

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:08.836
   - WHAT, IS IT SCOTT AGAIN?

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:10.004
   - YEAH, HE'S AT SHAREEF'S.

01:10:10.006 --> 01:10:12.040
 HE JUST WANTED TO LET ME KNOW.

01:10:12.042 --> 01:10:13.675
    - SO, WHAT, YOU'RE JUST
       GONNA IGNORE HIM?

01:10:13.677 --> 01:10:15.276
       - AFTER I GO BACK
      TO SCHOOL TOMORROW,

01:10:15.278 --> 01:10:18.379
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE THIS WEEKEND
      NEVER EVEN HAPPENED.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:21.816
   - YOU ARE A FUCKING IDIOT.

01:10:21.818 --> 01:10:24.185
     YOU ACTUALLY LIKE HIM.

01:10:24.187 --> 01:10:25.620
        AND I DON'T KNOW
       IF YOU KNOW THIS,

01:10:25.622 --> 01:10:27.722
     BUT YOU HATE EVERYONE,

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:29.090
        LIKE, EVERYONE.

01:10:29.092 --> 01:10:30.058
      YOU HATE MY GRANDMA,

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:31.492
       AND SHE BAKED YOU
        A BIRTHDAY CAKE,

01:10:31.494 --> 01:10:34.128
    AND SHE HAS ALZHEIMER'S.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.632
          WHO'S THAT?

01:10:37.634 --> 01:10:39.634
      - JOEL, I GOT TO GO.

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:43.137
    - ALL RIGHT, BYE, BITCH.

01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:46.774
      - DAD TURNED MY ROOM
          INTO A GYM.

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:50.211
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
 SETTING UP A TRAP TO KILL ME.

01:10:50.213 --> 01:10:53.581
    - WOW, I ACTUALLY NEVER
   THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THAT.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.950
             WEIRD.

01:10:58.121 --> 01:11:01.689
     SO, WHY DID YOU LEAVE
     YOUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY?

01:11:01.691 --> 01:11:03.258
        DID EVERYONE GET
       EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.392
      AND HAVE TO GO HOME?

01:11:04.394 --> 01:11:06.227
  - NO, WHY WOULD THAT HAPPEN?

01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:07.395
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:11:07.397 --> 01:11:09.264
     I MEAN, BIG PUNCHBOWL,
      NO ONE GUARDING IT.

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:10.398
         THINGS HAPPEN.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.532
  - NO, I JUST NEEDED A BREAK.

01:11:11.534 --> 01:11:12.934
   I MEAN, I LOVE THE FAMILY,

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:14.936
         BUT SOMETIMES
      THEY DRIVE ME CRAZY.

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:16.271
     YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:17.739
             - YES.

01:11:17.741 --> 01:11:21.276
MY GOD, I RELATED TO
A SOLID HALF OF THAT STATEMENT.

01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:23.711
      - SO WHY AREN'T YOU
      AT SHAREEF'S PARTY?

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:26.281
    - WAIT, HOW DO YOU EVEN
        KNOW ABOUT THAT?

01:11:26.283 --> 01:11:27.915
         - SIXTH SENSE.

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:30.785
    - DON'T YOU MEAN, LIKE,
           A FIFTH--

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:32.120
     YOU KNOW, NEVER MIND.

01:11:32.122 --> 01:11:33.254
           TOO EASY.

01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:35.089
       - I MEAN, YOU KNOW
     THAT SCOTT LIKES YOU.

01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:36.424
       - WELL, YOU KNOW,
        THAT'S TOO BAD,

01:11:36.426 --> 01:11:38.960
   BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HIM.

01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:42.430
  - YES, YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT.

01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:44.666
   - OKAY, FINE, I LIKE HIM.

01:11:44.668 --> 01:11:45.667
       BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:46.868
       IT'S COMPLICATED.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.169
       HE'S COMPLICATED.

01:11:48.171 --> 01:11:49.470
    ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
          HE'S SIMPLE.

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:50.638
      HE'S FAR TOO SIMPLE,

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.274
  AND SO SCARED OF EVERYTHING.

01:11:53.276 --> 01:11:56.144
     I MEAN, I WAS SO CLOSE
         TO FIXING HIM.

01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:59.247
    HE WAS SO FUCKING CLOSE
           TO BEING--

01:11:59.249 --> 01:12:00.248
        - JUST LIKE YOU.

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:01.482
        - WITH A PENIS!

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:03.051
 - HE'S NOT YOUR PROJECT, TORI.

01:12:03.053 --> 01:12:04.819
      YOU CAN'T FORCE HIM
   TO BE SOMETHING HE ISN'T.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:07.922
  YOU JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT HIM
         FOR WHO HE IS.

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:10.792
MY GOD,
     HOW DO YOU ACCEPT GIL?

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:11.859
        - I DRINK A LOT.

01:12:11.861 --> 01:12:13.428
  I'M ACTUALLY NOT EVEN BLIND.

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:15.797
  I'M JUST IN A CONSTANT STATE
     OF BLACKOUT DRUNKNESS.

01:12:18.201 --> 01:12:23.504
GOD, WE HAVE FAR MORE IN COMMON
        THAT I THOUGHT.

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:26.140
 - I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE GONNA
 GROW UP TO BE BEAUTIFUL, TORI,

01:12:26.142 --> 01:12:30.244
AND THAT YOU WERE GONNA HAVE TO
BEAT THE BOYS AWAY WITH A STICK.

01:12:30.246 --> 01:12:33.247
 JUST DON'T BEAT THEM ALL AWAY.

01:12:39.589 --> 01:12:40.822
 - I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU,

01:12:40.824 --> 01:12:42.490
SO LEAVE A MESSAGE,
         MOTHER-.

01:12:42.492 --> 01:12:44.158
            - FUCK.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:47.829
       - I WON'T TAKE NO
     FOR AN ANSWER, SCOTT.

01:12:47.831 --> 01:12:48.830
           - HEATHER?

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:50.331
      WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:51.999
         - I FOUND THIS
   IN SHAREEF'S MOM'S CLOSET.

01:12:52.001 --> 01:12:53.901
     ISN'T IT FUCKING HOT?

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:56.537
          IT'LL JINGLE
       WHILE YOU FUCK ME.

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:58.172
             WHOO!

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:02.610
        I KNOW YOU WANT
        TO DO ME, SCOTT.

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:04.612
       - I REALLY DON'T,
   AND YOU'RE REALLY RACIST.

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:05.680
MY GOD.

01:13:05.682 --> 01:13:08.282
- YOUR PENIS
        NO NOT THINK SO.

01:13:08.284 --> 01:13:09.283
           THANK YOU.

01:13:09.285 --> 01:13:10.718
      COME AGAIN, PLEASE.

01:13:12.522 --> 01:13:13.654
            GET IT?

01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:15.323
       IT'S, LIKE, COME?

01:13:15.325 --> 01:13:16.691
     - YEAH, NO, I GOT IT.

01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:20.128
   - OOPS, LOOK WHAT I FOUND
          IN YOUR CAR.

01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:24.499
     IT'S ALMOST BIG ENOUGH
        FOR BOTH OF US.

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:26.000
             BOOP.

01:13:26.002 --> 01:13:29.036
       GOD, I MISSED YOU
        SO FUCKING MUCH.

01:13:30.974 --> 01:13:32.607
 WHAT'S WITH ALL THE VIOLENCE?

01:13:32.609 --> 01:13:35.209
    - SORRY, I'M ON RIHANNA.

01:13:35.211 --> 01:13:38.312
 IT'S MOLLY MIXED WITH STEROIDS
        AND ADRENALINE.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.286
              ¶ ¶

01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:47.522
            - SCOTT?

01:13:47.524 --> 01:13:48.656
             SCOTT?

01:13:48.658 --> 01:13:49.957
     HAS ANYONE SEEN SCOTT?

01:13:49.959 --> 01:13:51.392
    - HE'S GETTING FINGERED
         IN THE GARAGE.

01:13:51.394 --> 01:13:53.428
          - I'M SORRY,
   SCOTT IS GETTING FINGERED?

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:55.296
       - NO, BUT YOU ARE.

01:13:55.298 --> 01:13:56.831
            - OKAY.

01:13:56.833 --> 01:13:58.599
     HAS ANYONE SEEN SCOTT?

01:13:58.601 --> 01:13:59.834
        - SCOTT IS HERE?

01:13:59.836 --> 01:14:01.035
        I LOVE THAT GUY!

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:03.404
    EVERYBODY, SCOTT'S HERE!

01:14:19.989 --> 01:14:21.856
     - YOU FUCKING MISS ME?

01:14:21.858 --> 01:14:23.391
         - PLEASE, NO,
      I DO NOT WANT THIS.

01:14:23.393 --> 01:14:24.392
             - SHH.

01:14:24.394 --> 01:14:25.193
      I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

01:14:25.195 --> 01:14:26.227
   - PLEASE, NO, I HATE YOU.

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:27.628
 - I FUCKING LOVE YOU SO MUCH!

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:28.830
     - I FUCKING HATE YOU!

01:14:28.832 --> 01:14:30.798
   - I FUCKING HATE YOU TOO!

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:37.472
- MY GOD.

01:14:40.076 --> 01:14:43.277
       THIS IS TOO GOOD.

01:14:43.279 --> 01:14:45.279
         - TORI, WAIT.

01:14:52.489 --> 01:14:56.090
       - YEAH, THAT ONE'S
    DEFINITELY THE UGLIEST.

01:14:57.861 --> 01:14:59.727
         - TORI, WAIT.

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:00.728
            COME ON.

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.864
        - LET GO OF ME.

01:15:02.866 --> 01:15:04.065
        - IT WASN'T WHAT
     IT LOOKED LIKE, OKAY?

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:07.034
       - NO, I CAME HERE
         TO APOLOGIZE.

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:10.204
    I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT I LIKE YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE,

01:15:10.206 --> 01:15:13.574
        ONLY TO FIND OUT
THAT YOU ARE A FUCKING ASSHOLE!

01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:14.609
- IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.

01:15:14.611 --> 01:15:15.943
  HEATHER BASICALLY RAPED ME.

01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:18.412
- MY GOD,
     SHE WEIGHS 90 POUNDS.

01:15:18.414 --> 01:15:21.282
             - 87.

01:15:21.284 --> 01:15:25.686
      - JUST STAY THE FUCK
         AWAY FROM ME.

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:28.289
TORI, WHORIE.

01:15:28.291 --> 01:15:31.425
         TORI, WHORIE.

01:15:31.427 --> 01:15:33.528
         TORI, WHORIE.

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.630
         TORI, WHORIE.

01:15:35.632 --> 01:15:37.598
         TORI, WHORIE!

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:43.804
    WHORIE, WHORIE, WHORIE,
    WHORIE, WHORIE, WHORIE,

01:15:43.806 --> 01:15:47.441
    WHORIE, WHORIE, WHORIE!

01:15:47.443 --> 01:15:50.077
        - SHE RAPED ME!

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:05.693
          - ALL RIGHT,
     MY LITTLE SWEETHEARTS,

01:16:05.695 --> 01:16:07.495
        NAME OF THE GAME
         IS STRIP CUP.

01:16:07.497 --> 01:16:10.798
      NOW, FOR EVERY MISS,
         YOU HAVE TO...

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.467
TAKE OFF AN ARTICLE OF CLOTHING.

01:16:13.469 --> 01:16:14.735
     - AND FOR EVERY MAKE,

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:17.805
      WE HAVE TO TAKE OFF
  AN ARTICLE OF CLOTHING TOO.

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:19.440
              YAY.

01:16:19.442 --> 01:16:20.241
          - IS SHE...

01:16:20.243 --> 01:16:21.642
          - RETARDED?
              YES.

01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:25.813
  - SOMETIMES I DRINK BLEACH.

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:28.516
  - HEY, I GOT TO TALK TO YOU.

01:16:28.518 --> 01:16:29.984
- I'M BUSY HERE.

01:16:29.986 --> 01:16:31.018
    - WHAT, WITH STRIP CUP?

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.553
    COME ON, IT'S IMPORTANT.

01:16:32.555 --> 01:16:35.289
            COME ON.

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:38.492
   OKAY, TORI'S REALLY PISSED
  AT ME, AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

01:16:38.494 --> 01:16:39.894
      - GO FUCK YOURSELF.

01:16:39.896 --> 01:16:41.829
- EXCUSE ME?

01:16:41.831 --> 01:16:43.364
- SHALL I REPEAT MYSELF?

01:16:43.366 --> 01:16:45.099
     I THOUGHT I WAS CLEAR
        THE FIRST TIME.

01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:47.201
   - OKAY, WHY ARE YOU BEING
         SUCH A BITCH?

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:49.537
     I JUST NEED YOUR HELP.

01:16:49.539 --> 01:16:50.771
      - IF I HAD TO GUESS,

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:52.773
        I'D PROBABLY SAY
   TORI'S NOT TALKING TO YOU

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:55.476
    BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY EVER
    THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF.

01:16:55.478 --> 01:16:56.344
        - THAT'S NOT IT.

01:16:56.346 --> 01:16:57.712
  - WILL YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?

01:16:57.714 --> 01:17:00.414
 THE DEPTH OF YOUR SELFISHNESS
        IS ASTONISHING.

01:17:00.416 --> 01:17:02.850
    HOW DARE YOU COME TO ME
          FOR ADVICE?

01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:05.019
    YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
   I'VE TRIED TALKING TO YOU

01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:06.520
 BUT YOU WERE TOO BUSY FOR ME?

01:17:06.522 --> 01:17:08.556
    TOO BUSY WITH YOUR HAIR,
 YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY, OR HEATHER,

01:17:08.558 --> 01:17:10.324
       WHATEVER BULLSHIT
 WAS CONSUMING YOU AT THE TIME.

01:17:10.326 --> 01:17:11.892
  - LOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW, OKAY?

01:17:11.894 --> 01:17:13.194
   YOU ALWAYS SEEM SO HAPPY.

01:17:13.196 --> 01:17:15.429
     - WELL, THAT'S KIND OF
           THE POINT.

01:17:15.431 --> 01:17:17.198
      YOU'RE ONLY WORRYING
        ABOUT YOURSELF.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.766
        YOU'RE NOT AWARE
     OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS,

01:17:18.768 --> 01:17:22.436
  LET ALONE YOUR ONLY SISTER.

01:17:22.438 --> 01:17:23.838
  I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME, SCOTT.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.606
            - WAIT.
     - WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:17:25.608 --> 01:17:26.607
       - I'M HUGGING YOU.

01:17:26.609 --> 01:17:27.708
             - WHY?

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:29.410
        - I DON'T KNOW,
     BUT I THINK WE SHOULD.

01:17:29.412 --> 01:17:30.211
        - SCOTT, ENOUGH.

01:17:30.213 --> 01:17:32.813
THIS IS WAY TOO DISNEY CHANNEL.

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:34.749
     - YEAH, I DON'T CARE.

01:17:34.751 --> 01:17:35.750
            COME ON.

01:17:35.752 --> 01:17:37.518
       LET'S HUG IT OUT.

01:17:41.724 --> 01:17:42.957
          - I'M SORRY.

01:17:42.959 --> 01:17:44.759
          I LOVE YOU.

01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:46.160
       - I LOVE YOU TOO.

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:50.264
       - I KNEW YOU DID.

01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:52.967
SO, I'M A SELF-ABSORBED ASSHOLE,
             RIGHT?

01:17:52.969 --> 01:17:54.769
         - PRETTY MUCH.

01:17:58.307 --> 01:17:59.807
  I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THAT.

01:17:59.809 --> 01:18:00.808
       - YEAH, FEEL GOOD?

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:01.809
    - YEAH, IT FEELS GREAT.

01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:03.611
  - OKAY, GOOD; GOOD FOR YOU.

01:18:05.815 --> 01:18:07.014
MY GOD.

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:09.183
    I KNOW WHAT I GOT TO DO
        TO GET HER BACK.

01:18:10.687 --> 01:18:12.453
       UNLESS YOU NEED ME
 TO STAY HERE AND TALK ABOUT--

01:18:12.455 --> 01:18:13.254
             - GO.

01:18:13.256 --> 01:18:14.255
   - DO YOU WANT ANOTHER HUG?

01:18:14.257 --> 01:18:15.456
       WE CAN HUG AGAIN.

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:17.091
           - GO, GO.

01:18:19.495 --> 01:18:22.496
 - STACY GOT TIRED OF WAITING.

01:18:25.968 --> 01:18:27.568
          - EXCUSE ME.

01:18:30.606 --> 01:18:31.939
            - MATA!

01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:33.574
             PITA?

01:18:33.576 --> 01:18:35.976
              RUN!

01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:40.981
             - NO!

01:18:45.755 --> 01:18:47.655
          SORRY, MAN.

01:19:06.676 --> 01:19:08.209
    - TAKE ME AS A HOSTAGE.

01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:10.878
     - SCOTT, WHAT THE FUCK
         ARE YOU DOING?

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.347
            - THIS.

01:19:22.325 --> 01:19:24.792
   - I'M A COMPLETE ASSHOLE.

01:19:24.794 --> 01:19:26.360
          I'M SELFISH,

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:28.329
       I'M SELF-ABSORBED,

01:19:28.331 --> 01:19:31.532
           AND I SUCK
  PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE TIME.

01:19:31.534 --> 01:19:35.202
   - YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE JUST
      STATING THE OBVIOUS.

01:19:35.204 --> 01:19:36.971
    - BUT I WANT TO CHANGE.

01:19:43.546 --> 01:19:46.614
        I'M SORRY ABOUT
       THE PROM PICTURE.

01:19:46.616 --> 01:19:48.849
  AND I'M SORRY ABOUT HEATHER.

01:19:48.851 --> 01:19:52.153
    AND I'M SORRY IF I EVER
     MADE YOU FEEL LIKE...

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:54.121
     I WAS BETTER THAN YOU

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:56.791
   OR THAT YOU DIDN'T MATTER,

01:19:56.793 --> 01:20:00.394
    BECAUSE YOU DO, SO MUCH.

01:20:06.736 --> 01:20:11.605
   WHAT HAPPENED WITH HEATHER
  DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME.

01:20:11.607 --> 01:20:15.176
   YESTERDAY WAS THE BEST DAY
          OF MY LIFE.

01:20:15.178 --> 01:20:17.178
 AND I REALLY WISH IT WOULDN'T
     HAVE TAKEN ME SO LONG

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.113
   TO START MY FUCK IT LIST.

01:20:19.115 --> 01:20:20.114
          - LANGUAGE.

01:20:20.116 --> 01:20:22.516
    - YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP.

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:25.553
- I KNOW THAT HATING EVERYTHING
          AND EVERYONE

01:20:25.555 --> 01:20:29.557
 IS KIND OF YOUR THING, BUT...

01:20:29.559 --> 01:20:33.194
     GOD, I DON'T HATE YOU.

01:20:33.196 --> 01:20:36.263
           - DAMN IT.

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:38.833
    I DON'T HATE YOU EITHER.

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:53.814
MY GOD.

01:20:53.816 --> 01:20:56.417
   YOUR HAIR LOOKS LIKE SHIT.

01:20:58.321 --> 01:20:59.954
        - I DON'T CARE.

01:20:59.956 --> 01:21:01.689
            - I DO.

01:21:06.596 --> 01:21:07.795
   - IT WAS RAPE, ALL RIGHT?

01:21:07.797 --> 01:21:08.829
        I SWEAR TO GOD.

01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:10.097
      SHE TRICKED MY PENIS
         INTO A BONER.

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:12.733
           - SHUT UP.

01:21:17.974 --> 01:21:19.573
           ALL RIGHT.

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:20.474
           ALL DONE.

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:22.743
      - HOW DOES IT LOOK?

01:21:25.081 --> 01:21:26.080
           - AWESOME.

01:21:26.082 --> 01:21:27.081
            - YEAH.

01:21:32.321 --> 01:21:34.388
   - I WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE.

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:36.824
      - LOOKING LIKE THAT?

01:21:36.826 --> 01:21:39.293
         JUST KIDDING.

01:21:39.295 --> 01:21:40.895
          NOT REALLY.

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:51.906
              ¶ ¶

01:21:56.178 --> 01:21:58.646
- MY GOD!

01:21:58.648 --> 01:22:01.882
        WHAT DID YOU DO?

01:22:01.884 --> 01:22:03.050
   - SOMETHING PRETTY STUPID,

01:22:03.052 --> 01:22:06.387
      BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.

01:22:06.389 --> 01:22:08.689
       WOW, WHAT MADE YOU
          DO ALL THIS?

01:22:08.691 --> 01:22:10.891
      - WELL, IF WE DIDN'T
         THROW A PARTY,

01:22:10.893 --> 01:22:12.426
    HOW WOULD JOEL GET LAID?

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:13.494
- YEAH.

  WE KIND OF LOSE IT FOREVER.

01:25:24.987 --> 01:25:27.454

    ONE SECOND TO THE NEXT.

01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:46.673
