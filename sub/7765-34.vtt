WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:14.260
( Beatboxing )

00:14.360 --> 00:16.780
Classic grilled cheese,
add bacon if you please

00:16.880 --> 00:18.880
If you want it,
come and get it

00:18.160 --> 00:19.500
'Cause we'll eat it
in a breeze!

00:19.600 --> 00:20.660
Got bread
Times two

00:20.760 --> 00:22.380
Got cheese
Por vous

00:22.480 --> 00:24.480
Both:  Got that bacon in
the grease that'll make you go

00:23.880 --> 00:25.260
All:  Oooooh!

00:25.360 --> 00:26.820
Both:  Bacon!
Baâbaâbaâbacon!

00:26.920 --> 00:29.180
Baâbaâbaâbacon!
Baâbaâbaâbacon!

00:29.280 --> 00:31.300
âAre you all done, sir?
âYeah we're done.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.400
( Sighs )
I guess we should head back.

00:34.960 --> 00:38.180
Not to be rude, but, uh ââ
hmm, how do I say this...

00:38.280 --> 00:40.260
Your hands are really gross,
bro.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.900
What?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Well, if you're gonna shove it
down my throat, Fives...

00:44.080 --> 00:46.060
Sorry.
I'd want someone to tell me.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.160
I'll just use
one of these moist towelettes,

00:47.560 --> 00:49.560
and everything will be fine.

00:48.520 --> 00:49.700
Aaah!
Huh?

00:49.800 --> 00:52.700
I'm sorry, but these are for
V.I.P. members only.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.020
V.I.P. member?

00:54.120 --> 00:56.240
'Scuse me.
V.I.P. coming through.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.860
Thanks, Rick.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.460
Here's your complimentary V.I.P.
merchandise.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.620
Later, normies.

01:03.720 --> 01:05.660
All: Whoa.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.940
And that sweet merch
and moist towelettes

01:08.040 --> 01:10.620
aren't the only thing you get
from being a V.I.P.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.340
You get table reservations
in the V.I.P. room...

01:13.440 --> 01:15.100
( Classical music playing )

01:15.200 --> 01:16.180
Ooh!

01:16.280 --> 01:18.500
...Complimentary
tater tots...

01:18.600 --> 01:20.220
Ahhh!

01:20.320 --> 01:23.380
...50% off anything
in the Cheezers gift shop...

01:23.480 --> 01:25.180
( Elevator music playing )

01:25.280 --> 01:27.200
âCool! Look at that stuff!
âIs that a Cheezers umbrella?

01:27.280 --> 01:29.180
But the best perk is,

01:29.280 --> 01:31.180
if you present
your V.I.P. card,

01:31.280 --> 01:34.460
you get access to
our exclusive new sandwich,

01:34.560 --> 01:36.700
the "Pork Picnic"!
( Pig oinks )

01:36.800 --> 01:40.140
Cowboy: Slowâcooked baked beans,
hearty coleslaw,

01:40.240 --> 01:43.060
and 3 different types of
barbecued pulled pork...

01:43.160 --> 01:44.260
( Squelches )

01:44.360 --> 01:45.580
Mmmâmmm!

01:45.680 --> 01:48.060
<i>Now,</i>
<i>that's lipâlickin' good.</i>

01:48.160 --> 01:51.620
It's available for only
one week, for V.I.P.s only,

01:51.720 --> 01:54.020
and will never be released
to the public!

01:54.120 --> 01:56.060
Bros! Huddle.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.160
I don't want to
assume anything,

01:57.600 --> 01:59.500
but we're totally gonna
become V.I.P.s

01:59.600 --> 02:01.600
and eat that sandwich,
right?

02:00.640 --> 02:02.640
âDefinitely.
âNo question.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.180
So,
how do we become V.I.P.s?

02:03.280 --> 02:05.420
There are two ways
you can become a V.I.P.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.500
Be an astronaut, or you've
got to prove you're worthy.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.900
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,
but are y'all astronauts?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.620
Well, no.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.620
That's what I thought.
Normie scum.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.940
Hey!
Listen lady, we can be V.I.P.s

02:18.040 --> 02:19.740
just like a lousy astronaut,
okay?

02:19.840 --> 02:21.780
Man, I'm sick of
these astronauts

02:21.880 --> 02:24.900
coasting through life, getting
free handouts all the time!

02:25.000 --> 02:27.620
So, I guess you'll just need to
just get to a computer,

02:27.720 --> 02:29.340
go online,
and fill out the form

02:29.440 --> 02:32.460
to begin the grueling
application process, scum!

02:32.560 --> 02:34.420
Dude, what the heck?
Maybe it isn't worth it.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.660
( Chomps )

02:36.760 --> 02:37.900
Mmm!

02:38.000 --> 02:41.700
Aw, man, it sure tastes good
to be a V.I.P.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.380
( All moaning )

02:44.480 --> 02:45.780
We got to get to a computer!

02:45.880 --> 02:47.880
( All panting )

02:48.400 --> 02:50.620
Pops: Hmm...Hmm, hmm.

02:50.720 --> 02:54.580
"H," "U," "M,"

02:54.680 --> 02:58.340
"M" again, "I," "N"...

02:58.440 --> 03:00.940
Look, Pops! We need the computer
to fill out a form!

03:01.040 --> 03:02.740
Oh! I won't be long.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.700
Lets see...
Lost my train of thought.

03:05.800 --> 03:06.780
"H"...

03:06.880 --> 03:07.980
( All groan )

03:08.080 --> 03:10.540
UâMâMâIâNâG BâIâRâD!
Done!

03:10.640 --> 03:12.500
Thank you, Mitch.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.600
( Clicking )

03:15.840 --> 03:18.900
All done.
The computer is yours.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Thanks, Pops.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.020
Okay.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.620
It took six hours, but
we finally finished the form.

03:25.720 --> 03:26.740
Okay.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.140
So,
we've got applications for

03:28.240 --> 03:31.020
Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man,
and Hi Five Ghost.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.380
All right.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.340
You boys are officially
V.I.P.s...

03:35.440 --> 03:36.620
âAll right!
âYeah, we are!

03:36.720 --> 03:38.420
âWhooâhoo!
âPork picnic, here we come!

03:38.520 --> 03:41.340
...as soon as you put all these
fliers on the cars outside

03:41.440 --> 03:43.900
âunder the hot, blisterin' sun.
âWhat?!

03:44.000 --> 03:46.160
But I thought the application
was the last thing we had to do!

03:46.240 --> 03:48.240
Oh, honey, I would never say
something like that.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.900
I'm not sure if this is a good
return on our investment, guys.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.460
Well, that's fine,

03:52.560 --> 03:55.380
if you really don't want
the Pork Picnic sandwich,

03:55.480 --> 03:56.980
available to V.I.P.s only,

03:57.080 --> 03:59.080
with our patented
three types of dipping sauce.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.100
The real chance
of a lifetime.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.200
âOkay, okay, we'll do it!
âWe'll do whatever it takes!

04:03.160 --> 04:06.380
I can practically taste that
hearty coleslaw right now.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.980
And I've been
takin' care of business

04:09.080 --> 04:10.380
Every day

04:10.480 --> 04:12.180
Takin' care of business

04:12.280 --> 04:13.660
Every way

04:13.760 --> 04:16.180
I been takin' care
of business

04:16.280 --> 04:17.540
It's all mine

04:17.640 --> 04:19.340
Takin' care of business

04:19.440 --> 04:20.740
And workin' overtime

04:20.840 --> 04:22.180
Work it out

04:33.280 --> 04:34.820
Oh, my stars!

04:34.920 --> 04:37.620
You boys have done so much work
around here!

04:37.720 --> 04:40.060
It looks like
a whole new Cheezers!

04:40.160 --> 04:41.700
Together:
( Tiredly ) Thanks.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.500
So, how much more stuff do we
have to do to be V.I.P.s?

04:44.600 --> 04:46.500
Oh,
just 65 little ol' things!

04:46.600 --> 04:48.220
âUgh! Come on!
âAre you serious?!

04:48.320 --> 04:50.600
It kind of just feels like we're
doing all your chores for you.

04:50.680 --> 04:53.380
There's got to be a shortcut
to being V.I.P.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.780
Together: ( Chanting )
Shortcut! Shortcut! Shortcut!

04:55.880 --> 04:57.780
Boys, I know this is hard,

04:57.880 --> 05:00.100
but you got to
keep your eyes on the prize.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.140
Now do you or do you not

05:02.240 --> 05:06.700
want that succulent
Pork Picânic sandwich?

05:06.800 --> 05:08.500
( Sadly ) Yes.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.720
Where are your manners?
Yes, ma'am.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.980
There they are!

05:13.080 --> 05:15.400
Now, there's an overflowing
grease trap that's lardin' up.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.900
Y'all better
get on that.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.260
And don't forget
to lock up!

05:18.360 --> 05:19.820
Good luck!

05:19.920 --> 05:21.300
( Door opens, closes )

05:21.400 --> 05:23.340
( Tires screech )
Whooâhoo!

05:23.440 --> 05:24.740
I really don't like her.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.940
This sandwich
better be worth it.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.820
( Russian accent )
Oh, but it's totally worth it.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.500
â( Gasps )
âI heard you.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.620
You are all
on verge of giving up.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.100
And why not?

05:35.200 --> 05:36.740
These chores
will go forever.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.140
What?

05:38.240 --> 05:40.260
The hostess is
playing you for fools.

05:40.360 --> 05:41.860
Giving you run around.

05:41.960 --> 05:43.260
You're normies.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.180
No reserved table for you.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.780
No tater tots.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.940
No limitedâedition
sandwiches.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.660
Not astronaut.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.060
Human garbage.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.740
That's a little hurtful.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.540
She is your enemy.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.300
If you want to be a V.I.P.,

05:57.400 --> 06:01.300
there is another way that will
challenge you to your core.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.140
Or you could just give up.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.300
We've come this far.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.460
We're not giving up.

06:05.560 --> 06:06.780
What do we have to do?

06:06.880 --> 06:09.740
I cannot say.
I can only show you.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.840
Will you meet me here
at 2:00 a.m.?

06:13.840 --> 06:16.100
Good.
Heh, heh, heh...

06:16.200 --> 06:18.200
( Chuckling evilly )

06:19.440 --> 06:21.440
Hi Five:
Are we sure about this?

06:20.800 --> 06:22.260
Yeah, this seems like

06:22.360 --> 06:25.020
some sort of shady astronaut
underbelly of some sort.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.120
You guys want to become V.I.P.s

06:26.400 --> 06:28.400
and eat that sandwich,
don't you?

06:27.560 --> 06:29.960
Ah, good. You came.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.340
This way.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.660
âSo, what is it?
âMunster.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.180
( Chanting ) Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat!

06:47.280 --> 06:49.500
So, do we have to eat that,
or...?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.100
Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat!

06:51.200 --> 06:53.820
Fine, we'll eat it.
( Chomps )

06:53.920 --> 06:56.260
Wait, this isn't even Muenster!
It's cheddar.

06:56.360 --> 06:59.220
That is munster's food.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.320
âWhat's that?!
âUhh...

07:02.560 --> 07:03.460
( Grunts )

07:03.560 --> 07:05.500
( All yell )

07:05.600 --> 07:06.780
( Thuds )

07:06.880 --> 07:08.460
( All groaning )

07:08.560 --> 07:10.560
Together: Huh?

07:11.360 --> 07:13.140
What the heck, man?!

07:13.240 --> 07:15.300
I thought you were gonna show us
how to be V.I.P.?!

07:15.400 --> 07:19.980
If you want to be V.I.P.s,
you have to defeat the munster!

07:20.080 --> 07:22.220
What are you
talking about?

07:22.320 --> 07:24.660
( Growling, snarling )

07:24.760 --> 07:26.380
â( Snarls )
âAah!

07:26.480 --> 07:27.500
Ohhh!

07:27.600 --> 07:30.180
"Monster," not Muenster!
I get it now.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.700
âAaaah!
â( Roars )

07:31.800 --> 07:33.300
( All breathing heavily )

07:33.400 --> 07:34.380
Aah!

Yeaaagh!

( Gurgling, snarling )

07:40.280 --> 07:42.280
( Chain rattling )

07:43.000 --> 07:44.300
He's at the end
of his line!

07:44.400 --> 07:46.100
( Snarling continues )

07:46.200 --> 07:48.200
Over there!

07:49.560 --> 07:50.620
All: Ohhhh!

07:50.720 --> 07:52.620
Huh? Whoa!

07:52.720 --> 07:54.720
Eat this! Hwah!

07:55.560 --> 07:58.200
( "Yankee Doodle" plays )

07:58.720 --> 08:00.620
âYeah!
âWhoo! America!

08:00.720 --> 08:02.720
Mordecai: Rigby!

08:03.600 --> 08:04.740
What's that?

08:04.840 --> 08:06.840
We found a jetpack
in the pile!

08:06.120 --> 08:07.660
We're gonna use it
to fly out of here!

08:07.760 --> 08:09.760
You really think that thing's
gonna carry us all?

08:09.320 --> 08:10.820
I mean, we've got to
try something.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.900
Everyone get on!

08:13.000 --> 08:13.860
( Grunting )

08:13.960 --> 08:15.540
( Whooshes )

08:15.640 --> 08:17.500
Whoa!
( Jetpack sputters )

08:17.600 --> 08:18.780

08:26.640 --> 08:28.460
( Monster snarling )

08:28.560 --> 08:29.420
What're we gonna do?!

08:29.520 --> 08:31.020
( Snarling )

08:31.120 --> 08:32.780
We've got to
get it under there.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.220
Grab that American flag gun.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.460

being an astronaut.
