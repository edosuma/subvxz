03:18.699 --> 03:20.742
Tilly can play out here
a little while longer,

03:20.826 --> 03:24.663
but pretty soon
she needs to take a bath.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.916
You know what happens when
Plink monsters get dirty.

03:27.999 --> 03:31.962
Oh, yeah.
I know what happens...

03:32.045 --> 03:34.840
At least, I thought I knew,

03:34.923 --> 03:36.383
but now I can't remember.
Hmm.

03:52.524 --> 03:55.569
Esme: Ooh. Tilly's already
looking a little dirty.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.237
Maybe we should
give her a bath now.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.363
Good idea.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.865
So, Tilly...

03:59.948 --> 04:03.034
We were thinking
it might be fun

04:03.118 --> 04:04.828
for you to take a bath.

♪ Bath time ♪

04:11.084 --> 04:12.502
She's very convincing.

04:12.586 --> 04:16.840
OK. How about this:
We'll play one game,

04:16.923 --> 04:19.259
and then it's bath time.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.386
Yay! Game, game, game!

Great.

Stinky Plink?

05:05.055 --> 05:07.057

Now you're

11:19.929 --> 11:21.055
Yeah.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.558
( sniffing ) And you
don't stink at all.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.435

11:25.518 --> 11:27.645

Oh, that was so much fun.

From now on,
I'm gonna pretend

11:38.573 --> 11:40.825
all my baths
are car washes, too.

11:40.909 --> 11:44.704
But I think I'm
too big to be a car.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.789
( giggles )
You could be a truck.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.167

Whoo!
Come on, Roy, jump on.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.277
I don't know.
Looks kind of weebly.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.363
Yeesh‐‐
and really wobbly.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.906
Roy, you won't know

12:19.989 --> 12:21.866
if you like it
till you try it.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.869
Well,
I guess you're right.

‐ Roy: Hello.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.244
Roy: Here we are,
the Swoozle house.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.329
Come on.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.916
Now, which doorbell
to ring?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.543
Hmm. All of them.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.545
( various doorbells ringing )

13:20.508 --> 13:24.512
Hello, monster‐sitters. Oh!

13:24.595 --> 13:26.514
‐ Hi, Grammy Swoozle.
‐ Hi there.

13:26.597 --> 13:30.560
Esme and Roy,
I'm so glad you're here.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.603
Come in. Come in, come in.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.605
I'll call Simon.

13:34.689 --> 13:38.359
Oh, Simon!

13:38.443 --> 13:41.362
Esme and Roy are here.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.948
Ooh, thanks for watching
Simon while I compete

13:44.032 --> 13:48.286
in the Monster Tennis
Classic Swazoozle!

13:48.369 --> 13:50.747
Hee hee hee.
Hi, Esme. Hi, Roy.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.040
‐ Hi, Simon.
‐ Hi, Simon.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.709
Look what I'm making
out of clay.

13:54.792 --> 13:58.212
Ho ho ho. Now, that's
a good‐looking monster.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.672
Who's it supposed to be?

13:59.756 --> 14:01.507
( chuckles ) It's you.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.509
Oh, yeah.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.636
I knew I liked his face.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.139
Handsome... ( chuckles )
in a fuzzy kind of way.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.515
( giggles )

14:11.184 --> 14:12.894
He's so talented.

14:12.977 --> 14:17.482
Now, Simon should be ready
for his lunch pretty soon.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.317
I bet I know
what he's having.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.487
Both:
A fish and stinky
cheese sandwich.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.782
( chuckles ) You know Simon.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.993
I made one just the way
he likes it.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.829
Looks... delicious.

14:31.913 --> 14:34.540
( sniffs ) Oh, I can
smell it from here.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.542
Now,
I just need my rackets.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.544
<i>Excuse me, Willy.</i>

14:38.628 --> 14:40.671
It's tennis time.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.758
Swazzah! ( laughs )

14:43.841 --> 14:45.009
Love you. Be good!

14:45.093 --> 14:46.177
Simon: Uh, love you.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.804
‐ OK, bye.
‐ Bye. See you soon.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.389
‐ Bye‐bye. Bye‐bye, now.
‐ Bye, Grammy.

14:50.473 --> 14:53.142
So, Simon, what do you
feel like doing?

14:53.226 --> 14:57.188
Hmm, I feel like...

14:57.271 --> 14:58.314
this.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.109
Oh, hey. I think
I know what Simon wants,

15:01.192 --> 15:03.528
and it rhymes
with sandwich.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.530
( happy grunt, panting )

15:05.613 --> 15:08.366
( giggles )
Is it a sandwich?

15:08.449 --> 15:09.867
Oh, how'd you know?

15:09.951 --> 15:11.077
Lucky guess.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.703
Come on. Let's go
to the kitchen.

15:12.787 --> 15:13.871
OK.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.082
So, you like fish
and stinky cheese, huh?

15:16.165 --> 15:18.417
I'm more of a meatball
guy myself,

15:18.501 --> 15:20.002
but every monster is dif‐‐

15:20.086 --> 15:21.462
( gasps )

15:21.546 --> 15:23.881
( growling ) Huh?

15:23.965 --> 15:25.883
Roy: Willie.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.219
Where is Simon's sandwich?

15:28.302 --> 15:31.180
( whimpers )

15:31.264 --> 15:33.558
I think I know
where it is.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.559
Willie.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.477
You ate my sandwich?

15:36.561 --> 15:38.729
‐ ( whimpers )
‐ This is not good.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.106
Not good at all.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.483
I'm really hungry.

15:42.567 --> 15:43.818
( stomach growling )

15:43.901 --> 15:46.821
Whoa, that's
a hungry tummy.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.614
Don't worry, Simon.

15:48.698 --> 15:51.117
We'll make you
a new sandwich.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.077
Fish and stinky cheese, please.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.412
You got it.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.789

sandwich coming up.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.799
Hmm? Be right back, Simon.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.179
We've got a problem.
There's no fish.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.598
Oh. Well, at least
there's stinky cheese.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.601
Right, except there's
no stinky cheese either.

16:16.684 --> 16:17.768
( gasps )

16:17.852 --> 16:19.604
No fish and stinky cheese?

16:19.687 --> 16:22.857
Um, no, but you're in luck.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.193
We've got meatballs.

16:25.276 --> 16:28.863
Hmm. No thank you.
I don't like new foods.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.823
( eyelids tinkle )
Ah, yes.

16:30.907 --> 16:34.785
I'll be back
in just a moment.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.162
What are we gonna do?

16:36.245 --> 16:37.663
We can't make a fish
and stinky cheese sandwich,

16:37.747 --> 16:39.790
and Simon won't try new foods.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.292
( Willie whimpering )

16:41.375 --> 16:43.502
Maybe he'll try new foods
if we take him to...

18:10.006 --> 18:12.550
We'll be right back.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.176
Playing restaurant
didn't work,

18:14.260 --> 18:16.095
and Simon really
needs to eat lunch.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.889
Maybe Simon will try new foods
if we turn it into a game.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.224
Yeah!

I'm hungry for fish
and stinky cheese.

18:53.382 --> 18:57.178
There's got to be some

18:57.261 --> 19:00.056

No fish and stinky
cheese anywhere?

Uh‐oh. Monster meltdown.

19:09.190 --> 19:12.568
I know you're
frustrated, Simon,

Oh, I wish he liked

Wait a monster‐minute.

20:03.577 --> 20:04.829
That's it.

20:04.912 --> 20:08.666
Simon can use new foods
to make a sculpture.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.459
Oh, yeah.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.211
Maybe if the food
looks like art,

20:12.294 --> 20:13.504
he'll want to try it.

20:13.587 --> 20:14.505
Esme: <i>Hey, Simon.</i>

20:14.588 --> 20:15.673
You're really great

20:15.756 --> 20:18.092
at making sculptures
with clay, but‐‐

20:18.175 --> 20:21.137
Do you think you can make
a sculpture out of these?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.347
Hmm. I guess I could try.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.142
Great. Everybody,
get ready.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.227
It's playtime.

20:30.688 --> 20:34.233
A little more over here.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.861
Let's see, uh, some meatballs,

20:36.944 --> 20:38.612
and a few more meatballs,

20:38.696 --> 20:41.657
and to top it off,
more meatballs.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.535
OK. Finished.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.120
So, what did you guys make?

20:46.203 --> 20:48.372
I call it,
"meatball mountain."

20:48.456 --> 20:51.167
It's a mountain
made of meatballs.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.002
( giggles ) Nice.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.045
I made Simon.

20:55.129 --> 20:58.257
Wow! ( giggles )
That looks just like me.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.884
What did you make, Simon?

20:59.967 --> 21:03.554
I call it
the "Monster Lisa."

21:03.637 --> 21:06.223
‐ Wow.
‐ A true monster‐piece.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.517
( stomach growling )

21:08.601 --> 21:09.977
( sighs )

21:10.060 --> 21:12.730
I know you don't like
to try new foods, Simon,

21:12.813 --> 21:16.400
but don't these sculptures
look good enough to eat?

21:16.484 --> 21:18.736
They do look yummy.

21:18.819 --> 21:19.737
Go on.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.238
Give it a try.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.908
OK.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.744
I guess I'll try...

21:26.827 --> 21:29.079
this carrot nose.

21:29.163 --> 21:31.290
Hmm.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.875
( chomping )

21:32.958 --> 21:36.545
It's crispy, crunchy‐‐ hmm.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.214
Nice orange color.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.466
I like it!

21:40.549 --> 21:43.803
Maybe I'll try
just a few more things.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.307
Oh, yes.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.768
Sweet.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.770
Blue.

21:52.853 --> 21:53.687
Salty.

21:53.771 --> 21:58.359
<i>Green, crunchy, warm...</i>

21:58.442 --> 22:01.821
Mmm. These new foods
are yummy!

22:01.904 --> 22:03.197
‐ Yes!
‐ Yes!

22:03.280 --> 22:05.324
Grammy: <i>Hello, everybody.</i>

22:05.407 --> 22:07.034
I'm home.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.286
And... swazam!

22:09.370 --> 22:11.622
I won!
( laughs )

22:11.705 --> 22:13.791
Whoa, what's all this?

22:13.874 --> 22:17.336
Simon, are you
trying new foods?

22:17.419 --> 22:19.797
Yes. Yes, I am.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.299
We ran out of fish
and stinky cheese,

22:22.383 --> 22:24.260
so we got
a little creative.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.471
Look, I'm a food artist.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.265
I'm proud of you, buddy.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.266
High five.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.185
I think you mean, "high six."

22:33.269 --> 22:34.395
Oh, yeah.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.897
( all laughing )

22:38.566 --> 22:42.027
Oof! All that monster
sitting made me hungry.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.612
Well, you're in luck.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.031
I whipped us up
some delicious food art.

22:46.115 --> 22:48.993
I call it
"The Leaning Tower of Pizza."

22:49.076 --> 22:52.121
( gasps ) It's beautiful.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.625
Art is delicious.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.460
( both laughing )

23:34.038 --> 23:35.623
‐Today, we're watching Snugs!
‐Yes!

23:35.706 --> 23:37.416

23:37.499 --> 23:39.209
