-Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?

00:15.333 --> 00:18.000
That walking this way looks really cool
but makes us late for class?

00:18.083 --> 00:19.000
No.

00:19.083 --> 00:21.583
Auditions tomorrow
for <i>The Three Musketeers?</i>

00:21.667 --> 00:24.166
We should totally audition.
We would be perfect!

00:24.250 --> 00:27.500
-Plus, we get to wear hats with feathers.
-Seriously?

00:27.583 --> 00:29.625
I don't joke around
about a feathered hat.

00:29.709 --> 00:31.375
Guys, but we're not actors.

00:31.458 --> 00:33.291
When you told Nick his hair
wasn't big this morning,

00:33.375 --> 00:36.041
-that was acting.
-I rely on you.

00:36.125 --> 00:38.000
But it looks great now.
[chuckles]

00:38.083 --> 00:40.792
-Oh, thanks.
-Wow, I guess I can act.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.417
[Kevin chuckles]
I'm gonna put our names down.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.750
If we do this, we take it seriously.

00:45.834 --> 00:48.750
-And I want a humungous sword.
-This could be fun.

00:48.834 --> 00:51.750
And a leather patch
to put my turkey leg in.

00:52.333 --> 00:54.625
What? In the old days,
they didn't have lunch boxes.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.208
You know, it would be really cool for us
to be the three musketeers.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.792
-So what do you say?
-I'm in.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.125
Let's do it.

One for all, and all for one!

01:06.583 --> 01:09.458
That's a little...
um, we should work on that.

Yeah. I hear ya.

for <i>The Three Musketeers,</i> right?

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

02:36.917 --> 02:38.333
Need any acting pointers?

I got rave reviews in
my kindergarten production

02:40.834 --> 02:42.291
of <i>Safety On a School Bus.</i>

02:42.375 --> 02:43.917
Music and singing come naturally to us,

02:44.000 --> 02:45.500
so we're just going to go
with our instincts.

02:45.583 --> 02:48.875
Instincts? Great. Really bad idea.
[chuckles]

02:48.959 --> 02:50.417
Let me give you a few pointers.

-That's OK.
-Sure?

-No thanks, Dad.
-Few pointers?

02:54.250 --> 02:55.333
How about a few pointers?

02:55.458 --> 02:57.834
Dad, would you please give us
a few acting pointers?

02:57.917 --> 03:00.959
OK, if you insist.
Come on.

it's all in the face, OK?

03:06.542 --> 03:07.667
All right?

03:07.834 --> 03:11.667
So, let's run through some
acting expressions, OK?

03:11.750 --> 03:13.875
Start with anger.

-That's good, anger. Angry!

03:16.417 --> 03:18.250
OK, all right.
Um, bravery.

"Oh, nothing can hurt me.
I'm so brave."

Good, that's good.
OK.

a little bit of that quiet star power

that I did as, Boy with Motion Sickness.

-What are you doing, Macy?

Oh, I lost my lucky charm.
I can't play without it,

04:29.625 --> 04:31.291
and we have a basketball game.

04:31.375 --> 04:33.291
Well, maybe we can help you.
What does it look like?

04:33.375 --> 04:36.125
It's a little charm that says "You're #1."

04:36.208 --> 04:38.750
And without it, I feel like #2.

-Yeah?

You don't need a lucky charm.

Yes, I do. It helps me win.
And I like to win.

that make you a great athlete.

I guess.

We don't want you to be late for the game.

Man, some people are so superstitious.
I don't get it.

I've used the same blue panda pencil
forever on all my math tests.

05:04.709 --> 05:06.291
And I don't use it because
I'm superstitious,

05:06.375 --> 05:08.125
I just always have it with me.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.834
Wait, where's my blue panda pencil?

No! No!

that I can't pronounce.

-You'll definitely get the part.
-Thank you.

-What did you want to talk to me about?
-Um, nothing.

06:07.291 --> 06:08.583
Me too.

We're so in sync, you and me.

Hey, Miss Snart,
my brothers and I are here to audition.

06:20.208 --> 06:22.750
I heard Jonas was in the house.

06:22.834 --> 06:27.500
And by "house,"
I obviously mean theater, not hizzy.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.750
Right. Um, but we're not here as Jonas,

06:29.834 --> 06:33.208
just Nick, Kevin and Joe
auditioning like everyone else.

06:33.291 --> 06:35.333
We don't want any special treatment.

prove yourselves like everyone else.

-Magnificent! You've got the part.

I still say we got our roles
'cause we're celebrities.

07:05.542 --> 07:08.709
I mean, how else do you explain
landing a role after saying one word?

07:08.792 --> 07:10.458
I didn't even say a word.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.041
Miss Snart, we're a little concerned
that we may have gotten our roles

07:15.125 --> 07:18.208
because of, you know, who we are.

07:19.834 --> 07:23.542
You absolutely got your roles
because of who you are.

07:23.625 --> 07:26.834
And who you are, are fine young actors.

When you've been a biology/drama teacher

07:30.834 --> 07:33.250
as long as I,
you only need to hear one word

07:33.333 --> 07:37.458
sometimes less, to recognize talent.
Bravo.

07:37.667 --> 07:41.291
I can assure you that
casting you had nothing

07:41.375 --> 07:44.208
to do with your ability to sell tickets.

07:48.333 --> 07:50.458
Yeah, nothing to do with it at all.

-where I get to wear my feathered hat.
-What's going on?

10:34.542 --> 10:37.083
I don't want to do this play anymore.
It's not my thing.

But with this play,
I have to be a totally different person.

that's made me a great athlete?

12:36.625 --> 12:38.333
Nerks!

12:38.417 --> 12:39.417
[exhales]

12:40.959 --> 12:43.750
Ooh.
I'm sorry.

12:43.834 --> 12:46.959
It's just that we lost yesterday
because I didn't have my lucky charm.

12:47.041 --> 12:48.792
I threw nothing but bricks.

12:48.875 --> 12:52.041
Me! Mighty mite Macy Misa!

12:52.959 --> 12:54.208
Here.

12:54.375 --> 12:57.375
Your Jacques Le Fejette
size eight-and-a-half calfskin boot

12:57.458 --> 13:00.750
-in hot cocoa brown?
-Why?

13:00.834 --> 13:02.959
Don't tell anybody,
but I believe in lucky charms, too.

13:03.041 --> 13:05.208
That's my lucky boot.
I want you to have it.

13:05.291 --> 13:07.208
But how do you know it's lucky?

13:07.291 --> 13:10.500
Besides the obvious fact that it gets
to hug your foot all day and night?

13:10.583 --> 13:12.417
I wear it every single night on stage.

13:12.500 --> 13:16.375
I've never done a performance without it,
and I've never been struck by lightning!

13:16.458 --> 13:18.291
Now if that's not lucky,
I don't know what is.

13:19.834 --> 13:23.125
Well, then come on, lucky boot.
Let's go kick some butt!

13:29.792 --> 13:32.917
-Hey, Joe, can we talk about the play?
-What about it?

13:33.542 --> 13:35.291
Aren't you guys gonna ask me
about my boot first?

13:36.834 --> 13:38.083
[both] No.

13:38.166 --> 13:40.041
Joe, seeing as how you decided
to leave the play,

13:40.125 --> 13:44.417
me and Nick wanted to let you know that
if you wanted us to quit, we will.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.458
I really, really don't want to,
but I will.

13:48.542 --> 13:50.542
I really don't want to.
But I will.

13:50.625 --> 13:53.709
I really don't want to.
But I will.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.792
I really, really don't want to.

13:58.041 --> 14:00.250
-But I will.
-Guys.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.458
I don't want you to quit because of me.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.583
It's really cool.
I appreciate it.

14:07.125 --> 14:08.750
I guess we are the three musketeers.

14:11.166 --> 14:13.792
-Hey.
-Hey, my two musketeers.

14:13.875 --> 14:15.667
Let's hit play practice.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.834
I think you mean rehearsal.

14:17.917 --> 14:20.375
Rehearsal, yeah.
That's what Miss Snart called it.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.208
Hey, where's your boot?

14:22.291 --> 14:24.291
Thank you for asking.

14:24.375 --> 14:26.375
You know, it is a crazy story,
it happened to me a little earlier...

14:26.458 --> 14:29.458
Look, um, I'm sorry to see you quit.

14:29.542 --> 14:32.417
Yeah, well, Van Dyke
stepped right in there.

14:32.500 --> 14:36.250
I mean, I'm not
Van Dyke Tosh, you know?

14:36.333 --> 14:39.083
Well, he's no you.

14:39.166 --> 14:42.166
Yeah, well, he's a pretty
good-looking guy, though.

14:44.625 --> 14:47.083
-Do you want me to lie to you?
-Yes, I do.

14:47.583 --> 14:52.083
Hey, Stella, come on!
One for all, and all for fun!

15:05.542 --> 15:07.959
It's a great risk, Porthos.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.125
[grunting]

15:10.208 --> 15:14.709
But Athos, we must trust... him

15:14.792 --> 15:19.000
if we are to save the life of the fair...

15:19.583 --> 15:22.291
Lady de Bonna...

15:22.834 --> 15:24.834
Lady de Bonna-de-so-la-boo.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.959
I thought rehearsal was over an hour ago.

15:29.041 --> 15:31.041
Yeah, well, some of us
needed some more practice.

15:31.125 --> 15:33.750
Ah, no problem, fellas.
I'm glad I could help you out.

15:33.834 --> 15:38.166
I did win the team-player-of-the-year
trophy two years running.

15:38.250 --> 15:39.959
Speaking of running, where's the can?

15:40.041 --> 15:42.208
-Over there.
-Thanks.

15:42.458 --> 15:44.834
Well, that is one classy guy.

15:45.792 --> 15:48.625
Yeah, but we still wish it was you
that we were rehearsing with, Joe.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.750
And I bet you wish Van Dyke
wasn't rehearsing with Stella.

15:51.834 --> 15:54.875
So he kisses her hand in one scene,
no big deal.

15:54.959 --> 15:56.417
So you did read ahead.

15:57.750 --> 16:00.917
Whatever. The point is,
why is Van Dyke here in our room?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.917
This is like sacred Jonas territory.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.500
It's not like Van Dyke's
going to replace you, Joe.

16:05.583 --> 16:08.417
Except, you know, in the play
where he actually did replace you.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.333
[Kevin]
Right.

16:09.417 --> 16:12.083
Yo, dudes, what do you say
we go grab some bites?

16:12.166 --> 16:13.375
-Sounds good.
-I'm in.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.625
-One for all...
-[Nick and Kevin] All for one.

Hey, guys, I just wanted
to say have a great show.

17:16.709 --> 17:19.333
Hey, thanks, bud!
We sure will.

17:19.417 --> 17:23.375
OK, boys, huddle up!
Go acting!

17:23.458 --> 17:26.583
Yeah. Um, Joe, this is really weird.

17:26.667 --> 17:29.667
I think this is the first time
we've ever performed without you.

17:29.917 --> 17:31.333
I guess so.

17:32.125 --> 17:34.041
Attention, everyone!
Attention!

17:36.417 --> 17:42.083
Last-minute change to the romantic
love scene between Porthos and Lady B.

17:42.166 --> 17:44.834
Instead of a kiss on the hand,

17:44.917 --> 17:50.375
the school board has said it's OK
for it to be a real kiss!

17:51.291 --> 17:52.500
What?

17:54.500 --> 17:55.792
Awesome.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.875
Places, everyone.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.750
-Curtain in one minute!
-[feedback]

18:05.417 --> 18:06.917
Popcorn?

18:07.583 --> 18:09.375
How can you eat at a time like this?

18:14.917 --> 18:16.792
Thanks for filming the play, Frankie.

18:16.875 --> 18:19.000
Your mother would be very upset
if she couldn't watch this

18:19.083 --> 18:20.792
when she gets back
from your Aunt Debbie's.

18:20.875 --> 18:25.250
-No problem.
-[cartoon sounds]

18:26.166 --> 18:29.166
Are you watching cartoons?
Give me this.

18:29.250 --> 18:34.250
I knew it was him, for he had the mark
of the criminal on his shoulder!

18:34.792 --> 18:38.083
Then it is up to us to save her
before she loses her head.

18:58.750 --> 19:00.667
[audience laughs]

19:00.750 --> 19:06.291
But, Athos, we must trust... him

19:06.375 --> 19:09.125
for tonight, I shall ask...

19:10.959 --> 19:12.834
I shall ask...

19:14.208 --> 19:18.959
"Sweep my beloved into my arms
and proclaim my love for her."

19:19.750 --> 19:22.709
Sweep up with my arms

19:22.792 --> 19:27.417
the love and proclaim for her.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.625
Looks like somebody
could use a lucky boot.

19:32.583 --> 19:36.458
Dare I ask if I may have your heart?

19:36.542 --> 19:38.750
Yes, yes, my beloved.

19:38.834 --> 19:41.041
A thousand times, yes.

19:41.125 --> 19:46.667
Dare I ask...
if I may have a kiss?

19:50.834 --> 19:52.709
Dare, dare, my beloved.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.750
A thousand times dare.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.291
Stella and Van Dyke are gonna...

20:16.875 --> 20:18.000
[Joe] No!

[audience exclaims]

20:22.166 --> 20:23.417
Joe, what are you doing?

20:23.500 --> 20:26.834
-I'm sorry, but he can't kiss you.
-Why not?

20:26.917 --> 20:28.667
Because this is my role.

20:33.709 --> 20:39.041
Dare I ask, may I have a kiss,
Lady de Bonna-de-so-la-boo?

20:40.458 --> 20:41.375
Yes.

20:42.792 --> 20:44.041
I mean...

20:45.834 --> 20:49.792
Dare, dare, my beloved.
A thousand times dare.

Oh, it's better than <i>Cats.</i>

21:21.333 --> 21:23.166
We'll return at dawn, my love.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.917
-One for all!
-[all] And all for one!

21:31.000 --> 21:33.417
And a leather pouch for my turkey leg!

21:33.500 --> 21:35.375
[applause]

21:45.792 --> 21:46.792
Hey, Kevin.

21:46.875 --> 21:48.041
Oh, hey, what's up, Macy?

21:48.125 --> 21:51.208
-Hey, how'd the basketball game go?
-Oh, we lost.

21:51.959 --> 21:54.458
-Did you get struck by lightning?
-No.

21:55.208 --> 21:56.750
Good.
Then my lucky boot worked.

21:57.542 --> 21:59.500
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

21:59.583 --> 22:02.667
Boots, charms... they're not good luck.

22:02.750 --> 22:05.542
It is talent and hard work
that helped me win

22:05.625 --> 22:07.250
all my awards and trophies.

22:07.333 --> 22:13.083
Oh, OK. So, then you're not gonna want
this cheesy little lucky #1 charm

22:13.166 --> 22:15.250
that I found on the stairs
this morning then?

22:16.458 --> 22:18.208
Actually, I don't.

-OK. Uh, that way!
