Yes.

Yes?

isn't it?

to annoy us?

No. I'm just trying to

what that world

was at grandma's,

move into the living room...

00:54.931 --> 00:56.216
They could have moved back.

00:56.307 --> 00:58.593
Which lwould have noticed
since I was driving
right towards them.

And unlike you, I got
friends on the outside.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.966
Porter.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.881
Doc. What you need?

16:09.845 --> 16:12.382
I'm running a special
on grilled cheese this week.

16:12.514 --> 16:13.629
I got some new
girly mags, too.

16:13.723 --> 16:16.715
l was thinking
of something
more Vicodinny.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.177
At least 16, and I
need them Friday at noon.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.639
Man, that's pricey,
but it can be done.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.394
How about you have
one of your peeps
on the outside

16:25.485 --> 16:27.976
send $200 to my boy
up in Trenton?

16:28.071 --> 16:29.572
I am peepless.

16:31.074 --> 16:33.816
This is just you
haggling, right?
No.

16:34.870 --> 16:38.533
You ever seen me
chatting on the phone?
Taking visitors?

16:38.748 --> 16:40.830
All right. I'm gonna
have to clean you out.

16:40.917 --> 16:44.660
I'm gonna need to see some
tuna, I'm gonna need to
see some stamps, stereo...

16:44.754 --> 16:46.369
Just give them to me
as soon as you can.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.590
(NICK GROANS)

16:51.845 --> 16:53.176
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

16:56.766 --> 16:58.267
What happened?

16:58.727 --> 17:00.513
l was trying to
use the phone, ljust...

17:00.604 --> 17:02.094
| just got jostled
a little, that's all.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.188
Who hit you?

17:05.442 --> 17:08.058
No. ljust... ljust
bumped into the wall.

17:10.614 --> 17:11.603
(CRIES OUT IN PAIN)

17:15.785 --> 17:17.400
It's not lupus.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.323
Is that good?

17:20.832 --> 17:22.572
Does it feel good?

17:45.440 --> 17:46.646
(SIGHS)

17:52.322 --> 17:53.482
ASOFA: Sick.

17:54.324 --> 17:57.111
HOUSE: No, I'm just going
through a bit of withdrawal.

17:57.410 --> 18:01.153
I'm trying to survive
on one a day for
the next few days.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.162
No.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.256
FiX him.

18:23.395 --> 18:26.387
It's not lupus.
He broke his arm.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.767
Or it is lupus,
and he was in a fight.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.109
He was in a jostle.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.605
Because if he admits
he was in a fight,
then he goes to the hole.

18:32.696 --> 18:35.187
That's why he'd lie
to the guards. He's got
no reason to lie to me.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.522
Oh.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.530
See? There are
those eyes again.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.538
How about a viral
syndrome or MRSA?

18:46.793 --> 18:48.658
No, wouldn't chew up
the bone that fast.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.038
But reaction to meds could.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.498
May I?
May you what?

18:51.589 --> 18:54.922
Make me lose myjob
by showing you
a patient file?

18:57.345 --> 19:00.553
But why don't you assume
no recent meds?

19:00.640 --> 19:03.473
How long can I assume
that he's been smoking,

19:03.560 --> 19:04.925
based on his yellow fingers?

19:05.020 --> 19:07.853
You're thinking
lung cancer, metastatic.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.768
l'll x-ray him on Friday.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.726
We share a traveling
x-ray machine with
two other clinics.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.481
I'm out of here on Friday.
He's not.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.024
Well, but if he throws
a clot and strokes out,

19:20.118 --> 19:22.780
you can use the x-ray
to do the autopsy.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.031
Start him on blood thinners.

19:24.122 --> 19:26.363
Very interesting practice
you must have run.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.370
No need for tests,
no need for proof?

19:30.712 --> 19:32.748
Where are you going?
To the proof store.

19:37.802 --> 19:40.054
You were right
about Nicole.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.467
About me not caring?
I thought so.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.383
It wasn't her mom.
It's her.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.976
She doesn't want
to talk to me.

19:49.064 --> 19:53.148
Please. I'm trying to
listen to your lungs,
not your self-pity.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.275
Cancer can wait.

19:56.404 --> 19:59.066
Hey, you heading out
to the yard?
Mmm-hmm.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.648
Mind trying to
find me a cricket?

20:02.744 --> 20:04.530
The old swap trick.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.445
You don't think
that'll piss off
your cellie even more

20:07.540 --> 20:08.996
when he figures
it's a different bug?

20:09.084 --> 20:12.042
l'll dress them the same,
like in Vertigo.

20:12.420 --> 20:17.665
I'll try. But they spray
so much pesticides, I'm
surprised we're alive.

20:21.429 --> 20:22.839
Good point.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.672
Hey.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.428
How's it coming?

20:27.519 --> 20:28.554
It ain't.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.476
Confederates be giving
themselves spanking new tats.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.599
They putting a claim
on all my Vicodin.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.100
Now I love you and all,
my brother,

20:34.192 --> 20:38.526
but not as much as
I love my gang of crazy,
roided out Nazi bitches.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.411
Now try an inch
to the left.

20:46.830 --> 20:51.995
Hear the difference?
Yeah.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.291
It's called
an acoustical shadow.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.127
Means he's got a tumor.

20:56.214 --> 20:57.875
How did you find that
without a stethoscope?

20:57.966 --> 20:59.422
I didn't even know
you could do this.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.420
Start the blood thinners.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.422
So I for sure
got lung cancer?

21:03.513 --> 21:04.878
7 , 5;?3333

21:05.765 --> 21:08.142
All you've proven is there's
an anomaly in his chest.

21:08.226 --> 21:10.217
Which means your
initial diagnosis
could still be right?

21:10.311 --> 21:12.142
Which, apparently,
really bugs you.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.061
I could do a clotting test.

21:23.074 --> 21:24.109
That's a good idea.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.442
JESSICA: We're just gonna
cut your earlobe a bit and
check back in two minutes.

21:27.537 --> 21:30.745
If there's a little blood
bubbling up, that's normal.

21:31.166 --> 21:35.705
But if it's
completely clotted,
it may indicate cancer.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.373
Okay? Ready?

22:00.403 --> 22:01.904
Are you really
leaving medicine?

22:04.073 --> 22:05.984
What are you gonna do?

22:09.746 --> 22:13.659
You know, for someone who asks
as many favors as you do,

22:13.750 --> 22:16.867
you sure don't make any effort
to win me over.

22:20.798 --> 22:25.258
Before I went to med school,
I thought about getting
a PhD in physics.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.219
You ever heard of dark matter?

22:29.474 --> 22:32.341
The way galaxies rotate,
the motion of the universe,

22:32.435 --> 22:36.178
it means there's six times
more stuff than we can detect.

22:37.065 --> 22:40.148
It's been theorized,
but no one's ever
proved it exists.

22:40.235 --> 22:42.601
So you'd want to research it?

22:43.363 --> 22:46.355
Why?
It's the greatest
mystery there is.

22:47.408 --> 22:48.488
Theory of everything.

22:48.576 --> 22:51.318
And completely divorced
from humanity.

22:52.080 --> 22:55.243
Me and humanity,
we got together too young.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.120
You have a gift.

23:00.213 --> 23:04.172
There is something
in this world you are
undeniably great at.

23:05.802 --> 23:09.044
You can read people.
You understand them.

23:09.973 --> 23:11.554
You gotta go back
to medicine.

23:13.851 --> 23:16.718
Well, if that gift is related
to what brought me here,

23:16.813 --> 23:20.431
you'll understand
why I'd wanna check
the returns policy.

23:20.525 --> 23:23.232
Hey! Is this
supposed to happen?

23:28.992 --> 23:30.152
Cool.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.955
Jiminy didn't chirp
much last night.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.760
If it's a disease,
he's six inches under.

23:51.598 --> 23:54.590
But this could also
be pesticide poisoning,

23:55.852 --> 23:58.594
which bicarbonate of soda
has been used to treat.

24:00.648 --> 24:03.731
See? Just so much,
and no more.

24:14.078 --> 24:15.067
Mmm.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.915
This is where
you say thank you.

24:26.883 --> 24:30.717
Or I say thank you
for not killing me.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.216
Thank you.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.376
Hey.

25:03.878 --> 25:08.622
The x-ray didn't show
any tumors. The acoustical
shadow was just a lipoma.

25:08.716 --> 25:11.093
I'm thinking...
You all right?

25:12.011 --> 25:13.421
I'm fine.

25:13.513 --> 25:14.878
Ibuprofen?

25:14.972 --> 25:16.348
It's not gonna help.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.979
You can look at
the patient file if you want.

25:29.987 --> 25:31.238
You trust me?

25:31.489 --> 25:32.604
Any reason I shouldn't?

25:33.157 --> 25:36.194
You're really not
good at reading people,
are you? Or buildings.

25:36.536 --> 25:37.992
People are complicated.

25:38.079 --> 25:39.944
And people change.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.655
Not that much to the first
and not at all to the second.

25:43.084 --> 25:44.244
But if it'll
get me the file...

25:44.877 --> 25:47.368
If we add clotting
disorder to the symptoms,
it's gotta be a toxin...

25:47.463 --> 25:48.964
This guy's the only
one with symptoms.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.001
It's either gotta be
his cell or his workstation.

25:51.092 --> 25:54.676
The laundry. So maybe
a solvent or detergent?

25:54.762 --> 25:57.754
Can you get me an escort
to gather samples?

25:58.099 --> 25:59.464
Dr. Adams.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.762
Why does this man
have a file?

26:14.157 --> 26:16.398
You need to get cotton swabs.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.869
Not now. I got
something to do.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.201
You're a prisoner
on tier time.

26:21.289 --> 26:22.995
By definition, you
have nothing to do.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.947
I'm gonna call her family,
her friends, her work.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.293
I'm gonna get
through eventually.

26:26.377 --> 26:27.913
You're moving slower,
you're getting weaker.

26:28.004 --> 26:30.416
This thing is attacking
your bones, yourjoints,
your blood.

26:30.506 --> 26:32.883
Look, my girl's
more important.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.428
She's not your girl,
you idiot!

26:37.263 --> 26:40.255
She was the girlfriend
of a loser drug dealer.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.933
You think she's got
the self-control to wait
around for three years?

26:44.020 --> 26:45.100
You think she should?

26:45.188 --> 26:49.101
There's a reason
we're locked away from
nice, normal people.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.227
Your life outside is over.

26:56.824 --> 26:59.816
Your friends, your girl,
everyone you worked with,

26:59.911 --> 27:01.617
they've moved on.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.622
Get out of my house.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.708
Get out!

27:14.383 --> 27:15.543
(PUNCHES WALL)

27:20.264 --> 27:22.220
Where's Sykes?
Off at his other clinics.

27:24.227 --> 27:26.639
Great. I'm gonna go
to the laundry.

27:26.729 --> 27:28.594
Give me some swabs...
No.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.351
What? He yelled at you
for letting me see the file.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.603
You'll get over it.
Few years of therapy maybe...

27:33.694 --> 27:36.822
Why did you lie to me
about what you were in for?

27:43.037 --> 27:47.326
Okay, so I drove a car
into a wall instead of
stealing some pills.

27:47.667 --> 27:50.625
You obviously don't care
what I did, you care
that I lied to you.

27:50.711 --> 27:52.702
You feel jilted.
I feel stupid.

27:53.130 --> 27:56.588
It doesn't even make sense.
Why are you doing time?

27:56.926 --> 27:59.884
You didn't have any priors.
You didn't hurt anyone.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.431
I had a bad lawyer.

28:16.279 --> 28:17.610
I'm sorry.

28:18.739 --> 28:20.400
We can't talk about
this case any more.

28:45.308 --> 28:48.800
We hear you're gonna need
an incentive to get
all my pills by tomorrow.

28:48.936 --> 28:52.554
I can't get all 20,
but once I get out...

28:52.648 --> 28:54.309
Give us a minute.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.399
Why do you think
I'm on buspirone?

29:04.493 --> 29:05.949
The stress.

29:06.662 --> 29:09.119
| get the runs
almost every day.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.657
Any sign of weakness,
20 guys would line up

29:12.835 --> 29:16.168
to stick a sharpened-up
toothbrush in my eye.

29:16.255 --> 29:20.419
So as much as my
better nature, really,
wants to give you a pass,

29:21.844 --> 29:24.631
it just wouldn't be
good for my health.

29:25.848 --> 29:27.509
See you tomorrow.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.161
I need your help.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.120
You got any matches?

29:55.211 --> 29:58.123
No. That's serious
contraband.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.045
What are you
planning to do?

30:00.132 --> 30:02.214
How about a stick of gum?

30:03.302 --> 30:04.462
Sure.

30:08.057 --> 30:10.139
I'm gonna need that, too.

30:13.062 --> 30:14.051
VVhy?

30:15.064 --> 30:16.895
Why do I need the pen

30:16.983 --> 30:19.725
that you always carry around
and never write with?

30:23.656 --> 30:25.237
This is plan B.

31:01.444 --> 31:03.730
What happened to your cheek?

31:05.197 --> 31:06.607
What is it?

31:06.949 --> 31:08.735
(FIRE ALARM BLARES)

31:11.871 --> 31:13.031
A fire?

31:13.122 --> 31:16.239
House, we gotta evacuate
this area. Come on.

31:22.631 --> 31:23.882
NICK: Hey, House.

31:23.966 --> 31:27.800
You were saying something
about how I should,
like, swab or...

31:27.928 --> 31:30.886
You're confusing me
with the clinic again.

31:33.976 --> 31:36.137
What, you're
abandoning me?

31:37.146 --> 31:38.306
As soon as you leave, I am.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.137
Why? What changed?

31:41.150 --> 31:46.486
I'm just done.
No you, medicine,
fixing people. Done.

31:47.490 --> 31:49.230
Now, get out.
No.

31:53.496 --> 31:55.487
Your lips are swelling.

31:56.749 --> 31:58.159
Open your mouth.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.501
Did you just eat something?

31:59.585 --> 32:02.418
Meatloaf, potatoes,
coffee...

32:02.505 --> 32:03.745
You allergic to anything?

32:05.341 --> 32:06.626
Guard!

32:07.635 --> 32:08.920
You're going into
anaphylactic shock.

32:09.011 --> 32:10.251
Guard!

32:10.971 --> 32:11.960
Damn it.

32:12.056 --> 32:13.466
I gotta make a hole,
so you can breathe.

32:28.989 --> 32:30.115
(FLUSHES)

32:30.908 --> 32:32.114
ALVAREZ: House,
get away from him!

32:32.201 --> 32:33.907
He's having
an allergic reaction.
He can't breathe.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.401
Lie on the ground
with your hands
behind your head.

32:35.538 --> 32:38.029
Alvarez, look at
what I'm doing.
It's a tracheotomy.

32:38.165 --> 32:39.701
Come on, man.
You know I'm a doctor.

32:40.167 --> 32:41.543
(INHALES)

32:43.045 --> 32:45.001
What's wrong with him?

32:46.173 --> 32:47.709
l have no idea.

32:51.095 --> 32:52.710
(CRICKET CHIRPING)

33:01.313 --> 33:03.429
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

34:38.535 --> 34:41.322
Saving us both from
contraband charges.

34:41.872 --> 34:43.157
(TOILET FLUSHING)

34:44.375 --> 34:45.831
It's been great knowing you.

34:46.085 --> 34:47.495
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

34:51.298 --> 34:54.290
I need to be taken into
protective custody.

35:09.984 --> 35:12.726
Wow, that was great.

35:13.570 --> 35:16.027
I think I really dodged
a bullet there.

35:16.156 --> 35:18.021
You don't need PC?

35:18.867 --> 35:21.574
Nothing personal.
We'll reschedule.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.569
Rain check, I promise.

35:29.712 --> 35:31.748
It wasn't the food.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.541
It was the heat.

35:34.216 --> 35:35.547
lt's mastocytosis.

35:35.926 --> 35:38.918
Could be set off by
hot liquids, like the
coffee he just drank.

35:39.054 --> 35:42.046
Masto's usually
a skin disease.
"Usually"?

35:42.391 --> 35:43.881
It can hit any organ.

35:44.059 --> 35:47.768
Joint pain, osteopenia
and anaphylaxis,
eyebrow loss.

35:48.689 --> 35:49.678
It fits.

35:49.773 --> 35:52.025
It's a possibility.
I'll run some blood tests.
Thank you.

35:52.109 --> 35:55.727
No. No! It's almost
impossible to confirm
masto with blood work.

35:56.113 --> 35:58.274
Just give him five aspirin.

35:59.366 --> 36:00.947
If he has masto,

36:01.076 --> 36:04.193
he'll go into anaphylactic
shock and won't be able
to breathe again.

36:04.288 --> 36:06.745
You do understand
the meaning of
the word "confirm".

36:06.874 --> 36:08.114
I'll do it.

36:08.292 --> 36:10.533
I almost died in that cell.

36:11.253 --> 36:12.834
House, you're in here

36:12.921 --> 36:15.378
because you think you
can do whatever you want,
whenever you want.

36:15.466 --> 36:16.876
You can't.
And neither can I.

36:16.967 --> 36:20.175
The ACLU would have
myjob, my license,
maybe even my house

36:20.262 --> 36:21.843
if I do an unauthorized,
experimental...

36:21.930 --> 36:24.216
But if it is masto...
It's not.

36:24.308 --> 36:26.139
Well, what do you have to lose
by giving him the aspirin?

36:26.268 --> 36:27.508
I'm not taking the risk.

36:27.603 --> 36:28.809
It's his risk to take.

36:29.146 --> 36:31.512
If he has another attack
and there isn't a doctor
in the next cell,

36:31.607 --> 36:32.722
he could die.

36:32.816 --> 36:35.979
For one second, will you
stop covering your ass
and do the test?

36:37.446 --> 36:38.481
I think House is right.

36:38.614 --> 36:39.729
No.

36:44.953 --> 36:47.945
You're a moron and a coward.
I'll do it myself.

36:48.749 --> 36:49.955
Guard.

36:50.626 --> 36:51.706
You're done here,

36:51.794 --> 36:54.456
just like every other place
you've ever set foot
in your life.

36:55.589 --> 36:56.749
If I ever see you
in here again,

36:56.840 --> 37:00.253
I will write you up
and they will revoke
your parole.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.311
JESSICA:
Dr. House.

37:14.817 --> 37:17.650
Did you get all the
Vicodin you needed?

37:18.028 --> 37:19.359
I'm not an idiot.

37:19.488 --> 37:22.275
That fire, that bruise
on your face.

37:22.366 --> 37:27.326
I talk to prisoners, I know
about exit taxes. You're
clearly getting squeezed.

37:28.956 --> 37:30.321
I need 20.

37:37.881 --> 37:39.746
And let me back in the clinic
when Sykes is gone.

37:39.883 --> 37:42.465
I'll take care of Nick.
You can't
if you're not willing.

37:42.553 --> 37:44.714
Just take care of yourself.

38:10.038 --> 38:11.448
Well done.

38:11.540 --> 38:13.531
I knew if you'd learned
nothing else in here,

38:13.625 --> 38:16.867
you'd learned the smart thing
is to fall in line.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.673
You're absolutely right.

38:35.189 --> 38:36.304
Hey! Hey! Hey!

38:36.398 --> 38:37.899
I need back-up here.

38:38.025 --> 38:40.141
Hey! Hey!
Son of a bitch!

38:41.069 --> 38:43.230
You gotta get past me
before solitary,
you hear me?

38:45.741 --> 38:47.231
Come on. Come on!

38:49.244 --> 38:50.825
Thanks for getting me
to the clinic.

38:52.206 --> 38:53.241
Take him out.

38:54.917 --> 38:57.408
I got only two years
left in my stretch.

38:58.170 --> 38:59.660
Take him out.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.829
HOUSE: C.O.!
Need a little help here!

39:02.925 --> 39:06.759
I need back-up! I need
back-up! Without back-up
there will be a fight here.

39:07.429 --> 39:08.714
Alvarez!

39:14.937 --> 39:16.518
ALVAREZ: Sullivan,
back off!

39:16.605 --> 39:18.516
Mendelson, you'll be
held responsible!

39:18.607 --> 39:21.599
Hey, I'm just
playing solitaire.

39:47.594 --> 39:49.300
Hands behind your head.

39:49.429 --> 39:50.965
On the ground!

39:57.938 --> 39:59.553
You are so lucky.

39:59.648 --> 40:01.809
We got a guy in an ambulance
heading to Princeton General.

40:01.942 --> 40:04.479
Another dozen getting
ear gas hosed off them.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.401
Hey, sit down!

40:07.155 --> 40:08.144
Back off!

40:08.282 --> 40:09.647
Sit down!

40:14.746 --> 40:16.577
Where's the aspirin?

40:20.168 --> 40:23.660
Oh, God. Did you get
beaten up on purpose?

40:23.755 --> 40:25.837
House. What are you doing?

40:26.300 --> 40:27.380
Hey!

40:28.176 --> 40:31.543
GUARD: House, open up.
This is a direct order.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.511
Yeah, it's always
a direct order.

40:33.640 --> 40:36.302
Eight months, and
I haven't heard an
indirect order in here.

40:36.393 --> 40:37.724
Dr. Adams!

40:38.520 --> 40:40.056
They're gonna revoke
your parole.

40:40.188 --> 40:44.932
They're gonna charge you with
extra crimes. You'll be here
six more months, minimum.

40:45.027 --> 40:46.187
Sorry, distracted.

40:46.695 --> 40:47.730
You were saying?

40:47.863 --> 40:49.728
I checked your file.
You didn't have a bad lawyer,

40:49.865 --> 40:51.150
you had no lawyer.

40:51.241 --> 40:55.075
You took the first deal
they offered you because
you wanted to punish yourself.

40:55.579 --> 40:56.659
You think getting beaten up,

40:56.747 --> 40:58.988
you think saving this one guy
will wipe your slate clean?

40:59.082 --> 41:00.162
No.

41:00.250 --> 41:03.208
Then why are you doing this?
Because I have a gift.

41:05.088 --> 41:08.205
Once you drink this,
you should get an attack
almost immediately.

41:08.342 --> 41:09.502
That is, if I am right.

41:09.593 --> 41:11.584
You just bought yourself
months in solitary.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.881
Was it really worth it?
If I'm wrong, no, it wasn't.

41:15.098 --> 41:17.931
No! No! No! Get the cup!
Get the cup!

41:18.060 --> 41:19.095
Drink it! Drink it!

41:19.227 --> 41:20.888
DR. SYKES: No! Grab the cup!

41:23.523 --> 41:25.229
GUARD: Hands behind your back.

41:27.110 --> 41:30.022
What were you thinking?
I don't know. I...

41:30.364 --> 41:32.229
l was... I was scared.

41:40.707 --> 41:41.947
No!

41:42.417 --> 41:43.406
You're fired.

41:44.419 --> 41:45.875
You're beyond fired.

41:45.962 --> 41:49.750
You're completely
un-hirable anywhere.
Do you understand that?

41:51.593 --> 41:54.960
Yes. Now shut up
and let's see if
he has an attack.

42:13.740 --> 42:16.277
HOUSE: Come on.
Just a little more time.

42:21.915 --> 42:23.746
DR. SYKES:
Get him out of here.
