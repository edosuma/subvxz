MARILYN: I'm not sure I understand.
Is it his grades?

02:06.827 --> 02:11.299
No, Mrs. Bartlett, it's not his
grades and it's not his attendance.

02:11.332 --> 02:15.336
Look, quite frankly, he is one of
our brightest boys here at school,

02:15.369 --> 02:17.238
albeit, unusual.

02:17.271 --> 02:21.342
Well, I'm just not sure why
he must be expelled, then.

You're expelling him for

press from inside his dorm room,

them to the other students.

Look, Mrs. Bartlett, to be honest,
I think he has a lot of potential.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.201
He's innovative, he's intelligent.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.303
He's obviously highly motivated.

02:49.337 --> 02:52.306
Perhaps this would be
a good time for an endowment.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.976
Uh, no. Mrs. Bartlett,
what he did was illegal

02:56.009 --> 02:58.178

everyone wanted to meet.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.012
Oh, absolutely.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.447
It's right here.
All right.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.548
Thanks.
No problem.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.117

30:18.150 --> 30:20.286

GIRL: Yeah.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.325
Hi.

30:30.029 --> 30:30.963
You're Charlie Bartlett, right?

30:30.997 --> 30:32.131
Yeah.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.333
I'm Kip.
Kip Crombwell.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.203
Nice to meet you, Kip.

30:39.105 --> 30:41.240
Yeah. Uh,

30:41.273 --> 30:45.978
do you think there's any way that
we could maybe talk in private?

30:46.678 --> 30:51.083
Uh... Sure.

30:51.117 --> 30:54.620
HENRY: Everyone, come on, this petition
gets those cameras out of our lounge.

30:58.925 --> 31:01.360
So, what's up?

31:01.393 --> 31:05.965
Um, is it true that you can
get a hold of medication?

31:07.066 --> 31:09.468
Yeah, I guess. Why?
What's going on?

31:10.636 --> 31:15.441
Well, I'm, like, totally depressed.

31:15.474 --> 31:19.078
I've been having these spells,
and trouble breathing,

31:19.111 --> 31:21.513
mostly in class.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.449
Hmm. What does it
feel like?

31:24.984 --> 31:26.618
It feels like a heart attack.

31:28.287 --> 31:31.457
But I'm thinking, you know,
it's probably mental.

31:33.492 --> 31:34.826
And I can't go to my parents about it,

31:34.860 --> 31:37.396
because they already think I'm a
freak, so I just thought that you...

31:37.429 --> 31:40.933
Look, I'm not a doctor, but, um...

31:40.967 --> 31:44.436
I don't know if Ritalin's
gonna help you.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.605
Do you know what would?

31:46.638 --> 31:48.107
I'm not sure.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.246
But I'm gonna find out.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.983
I'm gonna work this out, I promise.

31:57.984 --> 31:58.917
Yeah.

31:59.518 --> 32:00.519
Thanks.

32:28.147 --> 32:33.019
I get short of breath and dizzy,
you know, nausea, blurred vision.

32:33.052 --> 32:36.255
I mean, sometimes it feels
like a heart attack.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.690
Yeah, we call that a panic attack.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.492
Oh, is that what they call it? Mmm.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.161
Well, what can we do?

32:42.194 --> 32:45.764
Well, I think maybe I'll
put you on a low dose

32:45.797 --> 32:50.002
of Xanax and Zoloft.

32:52.238 --> 32:55.774
Okay, so, here's the thing.
In everything that I've read,

32:55.807 --> 32:59.711
there's not one case of anyone
dying of a panic attack.

33:00.746 --> 33:03.215
No?
No. Not one.

33:03.249 --> 33:07.186
So the next time you start to feel
anxious, you just tell yourself,

33:07.219 --> 33:11.490
"Hey, I'm having a panic attack.
I'm not gonna die.

33:11.523 --> 33:15.261
"In fact, in 15 minutes,
I'll probably feel fine."

33:18.230 --> 33:20.366
What do I do until then?

33:20.399 --> 33:22.701
CHARLIE: Murph, start him
on 50 milligrams of Zoloft

33:22.734 --> 33:26.038
and half a milligram
of Xanax as needed.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.742
Here, Kip, this should
provide you with some relief

33:30.776 --> 33:34.046
and we'll just meet next week,
same time, same place, okay?

33:34.080 --> 33:35.247
(BELL RINGING)
Thank you, Charlie.

33:35.281 --> 33:37.283
No problem.
Be nice, Murphy.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.267
Oh, Charlie, I spoke
to Dr. Weathers today.

33:55.301 --> 33:57.836
He said you may have not only ADD,

33:57.869 --> 34:02.274
but a whole battery
of psychological disorders

34:02.308 --> 34:05.111
that will likely plague you for life.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.578
Hmm.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.514
Sounds a bit melodramatic,
don't you think?

34:08.547 --> 34:11.750
That's what I said.
Then he went on to imply

34:11.783 --> 34:14.052
that you may have inherited it from me.

34:15.121 --> 34:17.223
I was rather perturbed.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.458
I mean, look at me. I'm as
fit as a fucking fiddle.

34:22.128 --> 34:23.195
Can't argue with that.

34:25.164 --> 34:27.132
Are you making any friends at all?

34:29.168 --> 34:30.502
Working on it.

34:33.672 --> 34:36.141
He says he doesn't want to see me.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.277
I can't stop crying.

34:38.310 --> 34:41.280
Well, sometimes people say one thing

34:41.313 --> 34:43.248
and they really mean another, like...

34:43.282 --> 34:47.152
He called me a loser,
and last night he hit my mom.

34:47.186 --> 34:50.755
You have to understand that what
he's doing isn't because of you.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.891
He hates his life so much that...

34:52.924 --> 34:54.793
All I wanna do is drop acid.

34:54.826 --> 34:57.463
I just can't handle this place.

34:57.496 --> 35:00.432
Duh, dude.
This place sucks.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.801
But I just worry that one day we're
gonna look back at high school

35:02.834 --> 35:05.304
and wish we'd done something different.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.238
So maybe you should...

35:06.272 --> 35:07.606
Get breast implants.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.408
I mean, a lot of my friends
are getting them.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.843
Well, that's up to you,
but speaking as a guy,

35:11.877 --> 35:15.181
it's kind of a turnoff when a girl
isn't cool with being herself.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.449
I'm not saying that I'm gay.

35:17.483 --> 35:21.320
So what if, you know,
I'm not attracted to girls?

35:21.353 --> 35:23.322
You know, this sucks, man.

35:23.355 --> 35:26.292
Well, at least you're
attracted to somebody.

35:26.325 --> 35:29.528
I mean, if you weren't, then
we'd really be up shit's creek.

35:29.561 --> 35:32.431
I feel very productive,
and I can't sleep at all.

35:32.464 --> 35:36.335
I lose weight, and I'm given
to frivolous spending

35:36.368 --> 35:38.504
and promiscuity.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.706
Wow. What I'd like
to do is...

35:40.739 --> 35:43.775
Introduce you to some of the
serotonergic antidepressants,

35:43.809 --> 35:45.311
like Prozac.

35:45.344 --> 35:46.812
What else can you tell me about...

35:46.845 --> 35:51.283
Feelings of depersonalization
and boredom.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.352
Anger and aggression.
Irritability.

35:53.385 --> 35:56.555
Obsessive behavior is I guess
what you guys call it.

35:56.588 --> 36:01.293

word that starts with the letter...

start with the letter "V"

43:03.148 --> 43:05.984
and I heard the ice cream truck outside

43:06.017 --> 43:08.787
and it always played the same song,

43:08.820 --> 43:11.089
Yankee Doodle.

43:11.122 --> 43:14.793
So, basically, he ran out to
stop the truck and it just

43:14.826 --> 43:17.629
drove right over him
and killed him instantly.

if you were drunk, Dad,

49:01.472 --> 49:03.474
he just wanted to welcome me back.

He didn't say anything about
me hanging out with you?

49:08.079 --> 49:10.115
Not really.

49:10.148 --> 49:13.985
Maybe the way to do this
is to ask a question.

What question?

49:18.523 --> 49:21.059
You're the professional.

49:21.092 --> 49:23.328
All right. Well, I guess
the obvious one is

49:23.361 --> 49:25.296
how do you feel about your dad?

49:25.330 --> 49:29.300
You mean, besides the fact that this
stupid job turned him into an alcoholic?

49:29.334 --> 49:31.702
Okay. Um...

49:31.736 --> 49:34.272
How do you feel about that?

more than me, to be honest.

"the night"?

mother was having an affair.

around, threatening to kill himself.

49:55.260 --> 49:56.061

and you stayed, right?

50:04.235 --> 50:06.104
Yeah, pretty much.

50:07.505 --> 50:10.241
Well, he promised
to get rid of the gun,

50:10.275 --> 50:12.743
and then he went into
treatment for a while.

50:12.777 --> 50:15.180
And then, for whatever reason,

50:15.213 --> 50:17.382
he decided he was into boats.

to say is it just...

and then the other one lose their mind.

Why would it be?
