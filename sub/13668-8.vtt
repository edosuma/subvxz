00:03.400 --> 00:05.680
Previously on St Elsewhere...

00:05.680 --> 00:07.680
Tell her her son was murdered.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.760
Then go tell Carson
he's running out of time.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.200
Where'd you pick up that
gorgeous brogue?

00:11.200 --> 00:12.440
Where'd you pick up that
gorgeous brogue?

00:12.440 --> 00:15.520
It's perfectly simple - we're
Protestant and they're Catholic.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.760
If it's any comfort, your wife has
given that woman a second chance.

00:18.760 --> 00:21.400
Would you call this being
out of the woods?

00:21.400 --> 00:23.680
Are you kidding?!
You're all the way downtown!

00:23.680 --> 00:24.640
Be right back.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.640
Be right back.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.159
Honey?!

00:32.159 --> 00:33.800
Tonight, on St Elsewhere...

00:33.800 --> 00:37.320
# But if we turn our backs

00:37.320 --> 00:40.480
# The enemy would strike. #

00:40.480 --> 00:43.120
I like the person underneath.
The natural you.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.040
Completely natural?

00:44.040 --> 00:45.520
Completely natural?

00:45.520 --> 00:46.560
&lt; (GASPING AND CHOKING)

00:46.560 --> 00:48.800
She choking, she's may aspirate -
get the suction!

00:48.800 --> 00:50.160
We've got to clear her lungs.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.360
Dr Craig, we need you
in Eve Leighton's room.

00:52.360 --> 00:56.360
'No-one else is available
and Mrs Leighton's coded.'

03:01.920 --> 03:03.480
Mmm!

03:03.480 --> 03:06.880
Ah, do you have to go now?

03:06.880 --> 03:10.880
Why did think I got dressed?

03:14.200 --> 03:16.160
I'll be over at St Eligius
in a couple of hours,

03:16.160 --> 03:16.880
maybe I'll see there?

03:16.880 --> 03:19.600
maybe I'll see there?

03:19.600 --> 03:23.160
You better not use my office
for business calls any more.

03:23.160 --> 03:27.160
The surgical unit supervisor's
starting to suspect something!

03:28.360 --> 03:30.400
(GIGGLES) I'll make your deal.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.520
Hm?

03:31.520 --> 03:33.080
I won't use your office

03:33.080 --> 03:37.080
if you don't leave my towels
bundled up in the bathroom.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.200
Why is everything with
you a negotiation?

03:40.200 --> 03:42.600
Ha-ha!

03:42.600 --> 03:46.600
And make the bed too!

03:51.920 --> 03:55.920
Neatly!

Yeah?

04:42.920 --> 04:46.640
What is this army, huh?
Be all that you can be?

04:46.640 --> 04:50.640
This is in memory
of Patrick Brennan.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.880
Ah, scrambled eggs and Italian
sausage - what's the occasion?

04:54.880 --> 04:57.400
I got something to tell you.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.760
Hey, Dad, morning.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.440
Morning, sweetheart.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.560
Hi, Mrs Catalano.

05:01.560 --> 05:02.360
Morning, darling.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.600
Morning, darling.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.920
No, not yet.

05:04.920 --> 05:05.560
Sit down, have your breakfast.

05:05.560 --> 05:06.920
Sit down, have your breakfast.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.640
Bye.  Brigante.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.160
Tell me what?

05:15.160 --> 05:16.720
Oh...

05:16.720 --> 05:19.240
Dr Westphall...

05:19.240 --> 05:21.840
..you remember the first time
I came here to work for you?

05:21.840 --> 05:24.200
Sure I do.
Lizzie was still in diapers.

05:24.200 --> 05:28.200
Do you remember that, even then, I
told you that I had some plans to...

05:30.120 --> 05:33.520
someday go back to my family
in Castellammare del Golfo?

05:33.520 --> 05:34.720
Yes, I remember.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.800
Take a couple of weeks.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.680
No, not to visit...

05:38.680 --> 05:39.720
..to live.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.640
Oh.

05:41.640 --> 05:45.640
(EXHALES) I've been thinking
about this for a long time but...

05:48.400 --> 05:51.640
Well, Frannie, you have
to live your own life, huh?

05:51.640 --> 05:53.240
I love this family.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.800
I don't know what we'd have done
without you all these years,

05:55.800 --> 05:57.240
I mean it.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.400
And it's going to be very hard
to replace you, lady.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.680
Oh, I stay.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.880
I stay until you find somebody who's
going to be willing to learn

06:03.880 --> 06:06.240
how to take care of Tommy
just the way I did.

06:06.240 --> 06:10.240
No, no, no, you go ahead
and make your plans. &gt;

06:10.240 --> 06:12.880
Tommy, il piccolo tesoro.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.280
He's so special.

06:14.280 --> 06:17.040
How am I going to tell him?

06:17.040 --> 06:19.680
I'll tell him. Tonight.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.000
Grazie.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.120
I'd better hurry him along, eh?
Tommy!

06:24.120 --> 06:26.400
Tommy! Come down,
you'll be late for school.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.840
(SIGHS)

06:28.840 --> 06:31.360
Frannie, I think it's great news,
I really do.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.080
And I'll tell you what
we're going to do,

06:33.080 --> 06:36.040
we're going to give you the greatest
party the north side's ever seen.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.280
And, listen, if you need
some money you tell me...

06:37.280 --> 06:38.360
And, listen, if you need
some money you tell me...

06:38.360 --> 06:41.160
Come on, eat your eggs,
they're getting cold!

06:41.160 --> 06:42.920
Ah, here he comes!

06:42.920 --> 06:45.200
Eccolo qua, il mio Tomaso!

06:45.200 --> 06:49.200
Ooh, what a good boy,
you put your sweater on. Bravo!

06:50.480 --> 06:51.560
Hi, sport.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.360
Tommy wants cereal.

06:55.360 --> 06:59.360
Sure.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.240
I'm a doctor, not a librarian.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.320
Helen, can you go
to Miss Chipony's room?

07:08.320 --> 07:09.360
What's the matter?

07:09.360 --> 07:11.680
Well, I removed a piece of glass
from her left eye

07:11.680 --> 07:13.880
and I appreciate the fact
her world is a little fuzzy

07:13.880 --> 07:17.440
but I mean come on,
I've been on call 36 hours!

07:17.440 --> 07:19.080
It's not my fault she was
in the middle

07:19.080 --> 07:20.480
of Sidney Sheldon's
latest masterpiece!

07:20.480 --> 07:21.880
of Sidney Sheldon's
latest masterpiece!

07:21.880 --> 07:24.120
It's not what I want,
Miss Chipony wants me to read to her.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.200
It's not what I want,
Miss Chipony wants me to read to her.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.760
Helen, I don't have time
to be nice to the patients!

07:26.760 --> 07:27.800
Helen, I don't have time
to be nice to the patients!

07:27.800 --> 07:30.600
I'm on my way to an emergency
meeting of all the head nurses.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.720
Ask one of the candy stripers.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.400
Candy stripers?! I didn't know
those bimbettes could read!

07:35.400 --> 07:37.000
Has anyone ever told you
you're a pig?

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Yeah, a couple of people.

07:41.960 --> 07:45.400
Hey, toots...

07:45.400 --> 07:48.600
I want you to do me a favour,
that is, if you're not tied up. Ha!

07:48.600 --> 07:49.640
Hi, Victor!

07:49.640 --> 07:50.760
Hi, Bobbi!

07:50.760 --> 07:52.840
Oh, oh, call me Roberta.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.760
What are you doing here?

07:54.760 --> 07:58.360
Er, well, I'm almost finished with
Dr Weiss and the sessions and so,

07:58.360 --> 08:01.280
well, he thought it would be good
therapy for me to come to St Eligius

08:01.280 --> 08:02.800
and work as a candy stripe.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.000
Oh, you mean you're cured?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.120
Completely.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.480
See, Dr Weiss and I discovered
that my need to be tied up

08:08.480 --> 08:11.200
came from a prenatal
womb phenomenon.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.200
My umbilical cord was wrapped
around my wrists.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.440
That Weiss is a real thinker.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.000
Yeah. Oh, I'm a new woman, Victor.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.120
No more Bobbi - see, Roberta Sloan.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.160
Fantastic.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.200
Yeah.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.240
No, thanks.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.600
You know, I told
Dr Weiss all about you.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.040
You did?!

08:26.040 --> 08:27.080
You did?!

08:27.080 --> 08:30.520
In fact, he thought that you could
be a positive influence on my life.

08:30.520 --> 08:31.560
He did?!

08:31.560 --> 08:33.480
Mm-hm, so, what you say?

08:33.480 --> 08:35.440
You think, maybe,
we could go out sometime?

08:35.440 --> 08:37.320
Absolutely!

08:37.320 --> 08:39.320
You know, I've got a couple hours
free right after lunch.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.600
You know, I've got a couple hours
free right after lunch.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.559
Oh, er, did you want me
to do something for you?

08:43.559 --> 08:46.120
No, no, no, no, no,
I'll take care of it myself.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.840
OK. Bye.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.200
OK, bye.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.240
Bye-bye.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.280
I'll see you later.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.440
So long.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.760
Adios.

08:54.760 --> 08:55.920
I'm sorry.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.040
Oh, sorry.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.440
Excuse me.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.360
Very sorry.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.240
(LAUGHS) I don't believe it!

09:04.240 --> 09:05.480
(LAUGHS) No, let me tell you.

09:05.480 --> 09:05.880
Yeah.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.240
Yeah.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.280
Yeah, right.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.600
..and there are all the students
standing in a circle,

09:10.600 --> 09:12.880
holding hands with John Novak

09:12.880 --> 09:14.400
and another student
standing in the middle.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.560
and another student
standing in the middle.

09:15.560 --> 09:19.080
Well, let me tell you. All of a
sudden the circle divides into two.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.680
One half goes with John Novak

09:20.680 --> 09:21.960
and the other half goes
with the student.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.240
and the other half goes
with the student.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.000
You got it!

09:24.000 --> 09:25.400
You got it!

09:25.400 --> 09:26.720
New teaching methods!

09:26.720 --> 09:29.400
Ah, there you are. &gt;

09:29.400 --> 09:32.760
Telling you to start exercising
was a big mistake.

09:32.760 --> 09:34.040
Now I can't keep track of you!

09:34.040 --> 09:37.520
Dr Craig, this is Agnes Najinsky,
she is the principal at Paul Revere.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.560
Oh, I'm so sorry!

09:38.560 --> 09:40.040
(LAUGHS) Oh, it's not that bad!

09:40.040 --> 09:42.600
But it'll be a lot better
when Eve gets back to her classroom.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.320
Well, one step at a time,
Mrs Najinsky.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.960
We're just sending
her home this week.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.800
Oh, home, I can't wait to get
back to my garden.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.160
Well, I hope you have an ice pick,
it's the middle of winter out there!

09:52.160 --> 09:53.920
Well, I hope you have an ice pick,
it's the middle of winter out there!

09:53.920 --> 09:55.560
See, I'm as passionate
about my garden

09:55.560 --> 09:56.760
as you are about planting hearts!

09:56.760 --> 09:57.800
as you are about planting hearts!

09:57.800 --> 10:00.680
Well, well, it's time
to face the music.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.080
This week Novak's teaching genetics
and I'm terrified!

10:03.080 --> 10:04.440
Oh, God! (LAUGHS)

10:04.440 --> 10:05.640
Nice to meet you, Dr Craig.

10:05.640 --> 10:06.680
Same here.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.520
Bye.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.640
How's your temperature?

10:09.640 --> 10:11.480
Oh, I feel fine.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.480
You wanted to see me?

10:12.480 --> 10:13.680
You wanted to see me?

10:13.680 --> 10:16.240
What do I have to do to become
an organ donor?

10:16.240 --> 10:17.760
What are you talking about?

10:17.760 --> 10:20.120
Well, you said yourself that,
outside of my heart,

10:20.120 --> 10:24.120
I'm in peak condition and, well, I
just want to pass on the opportunity

10:24.280 --> 10:25.880
in case anything happens.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.400
Nothing is going to happen.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.840
Yeah, I know

10:28.840 --> 10:32.360
but, even if the transplant adds
another ten years to my life,

10:32.360 --> 10:33.800
I'm going to die at some point.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.800
Who knows, Mark,
you may want my kidneys.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.200
You're incredible.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.640
OK, I'll get the forms.

10:42.640 --> 10:43.680
(COUGHS)

10:43.680 --> 10:45.520
But first, I'm going to get
you back to your room.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.560
But first, I'm going to get
you back to your room.

10:46.560 --> 10:50.200
Come on.

10:50.200 --> 10:54.200
There we go.

10:55.040 --> 10:59.040
By the way, did you get
the clock I sent you?

11:08.720 --> 11:11.760
Look, Eddie, this is, this is going
to be pretty grim, all right?

11:11.760 --> 11:13.560
It's one thing to talk
about a tragedy

11:13.560 --> 11:16.680
but it's another thing to see
the actual results, all right?

11:16.680 --> 11:20.680
I can only imagine how you feel
but whatever it is, it's OK.

11:22.360 --> 11:26.360
(OK?)

11:30.760 --> 11:32.200
Dr Martin?

11:32.200 --> 11:32.840
Yes.

11:32.840 --> 11:36.760
Yes.

11:36.760 --> 11:40.760
Oh, yes. Right this way.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.960
That's them.

12:02.960 --> 12:06.960
That's my aunt and uncle.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.280
(Thank you.)

12:12.280 --> 12:13.280
What have you got?

12:13.280 --> 12:15.480
What have you got?

12:15.480 --> 12:19.000
posterior head injury with loss
of consciousness for 15 minutes,

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
BP 110/60, heart rate 104
and regular.

12:23.360 --> 12:24.400
&lt; Ahh!

12:24.400 --> 12:25.960
Respiration 24 and regular.

12:25.960 --> 12:26.760
Let me just see him.

12:26.760 --> 12:30.520
Let me just see him.

12:30.520 --> 12:34.520
Shirley, this is Bobby Caldwell.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.840
The actual damage to the rectory
is the least of it.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.560
Frankly, I'm afraid
it's just the start

12:41.560 --> 12:42.680
of a wave of violence and terrorism.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.920
of a wave of violence and terrorism.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.360
Patrick Brennan's family
has been a member of St Ursula's

12:47.360 --> 12:48.760
for as long as I can remember.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.920
His death sent a shockwave
through the entire parish.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.840
The bombing at the pub,
the rectory fire...

12:54.840 --> 12:57.400
..it's going to keep escalating,
Donald, unless we act now.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.440
What can we do?

12:58.440 --> 13:01.440
My suggestion is to get Carson away
from St Eligius as soon as possible.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.800
And where do I move him?

13:02.800 --> 13:04.800
Anywhere. As long as it's not in the
middle of the neighbourhood.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.480
Anywhere. As long as it's not in the
middle of the neighbourhood.

13:06.480 --> 13:10.480
I don't see how moving him is going
to solve the bigger problem.

13:10.840 --> 13:13.320
If we could do that, my friend,
I'd be made a Cardinal

13:13.320 --> 13:16.200
and you'd win the Nobel Peace Prize.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.200
Doesn't it gall you, though,
as a priest I mean,

13:18.200 --> 13:20.120
to know that these people
are using religion

13:20.120 --> 13:22.080
as an excuse for violence
and political gain?

13:22.080 --> 13:25.120
God does not smile on this
conflict, Dr Westphall.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.640
They call themselves Catholics
and Protestants

13:27.640 --> 13:29.440
but the labels are
totally meaningless.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.760
It's nothing but a stupid,
ugly gang war.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.560
&lt; In Belfast as well as here.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.800
Yup.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.360
BUZZER SOUNDS

13:36.360 --> 13:39.160
Excuse me.

13:39.160 --> 13:42.240
Yeah.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.440
Oh, no.

13:44.440 --> 13:47.560
Well, how is he? Is he stabilised? &gt;

13:47.560 --> 13:51.560
Any apparent neck, back,
trunk or extremity trauma?

13:51.600 --> 13:54.200
Well, thank God for that.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.800
All right, keep me posted.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.920
Thanks.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.960
What's happened?

13:58.960 --> 14:02.280
One of our doctors, Bobby Caldwell,
they just brought him into ER.

14:02.280 --> 14:06.280
Apparently he's been
beaten up badly. &gt;

14:07.440 --> 14:08.480
Where were we?

14:08.480 --> 14:12.000
I...

14:12.000 --> 14:14.360
Where are you going?

14:14.360 --> 14:18.360
I, er, I have to go see him.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.640
Where's Bobby?

14:46.640 --> 14:47.000
Bobby?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.160
Bobby?

14:48.160 --> 14:52.160
Cubicle three but you're
going to have to wait.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.040
How is he?

14:54.040 --> 14:55.000
(SHOUTS) How is he?! Oh, Bobby.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.320
(SHOUTS) How is he?! Oh, Bobby.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.800
He's fine. &gt;

14:57.800 --> 14:59.960
Hiya, sweetheart.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.000
What you doing here?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.960
Oh!

15:02.960 --> 15:06.960
"Sweetheart"?

15:09.280 --> 15:12.080
Mrs Leighton, how are you
feeling this morning?

15:12.080 --> 15:13.800
Fine. Who are you?

15:13.800 --> 15:15.440
Gretchen Parks, dietician.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.880
Oh, yes.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.880
You know, you've been here
almost three months

15:19.880 --> 15:22.280
and every time I've made an
appointment to see you

15:22.280 --> 15:24.400
something silly's gotten in the way.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.800
Either you're asleep,
or in surgery, or with visitors!

15:27.800 --> 15:30.960
Well, see, to tell you the truth,
erm, I've been trying to avoid you.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.560
Really?

15:32.560 --> 15:36.560
All I wanted to do was to talk
about post-operative nutrition

15:36.560 --> 15:38.600
and the importance
of a balanced diet.

15:38.600 --> 15:42.040
Well, Mrs Parks, I'm 44 years old

15:42.040 --> 15:45.800
and I consider myself to be well
educated and I just don't...

15:45.800 --> 15:49.760
Uh-huh, and the main thing
to avoid is fatty calories

15:49.760 --> 15:52.720
and that's where our friend
Mr Chicken comes in.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.440
Oh? Mr chicken?

15:54.440 --> 15:55.480
Mm!

15:55.480 --> 15:57.600
Wait a minute, this is Mr Chicken?

15:57.600 --> 15:59.200
Are you an egg freak, Mrs Leighton?

15:59.200 --> 16:01.240
Er, not in the usual
sense of the word.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.920
Good.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.560
Do you butter your bread?

16:04.560 --> 16:05.680
Every chance I get.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.760
Not any more you don't!

16:07.760 --> 16:10.600
It all boils down to common sense.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.760
Is this leftover
from yesterday's lunch?

16:12.760 --> 16:14.480
Mm, now, you don't want
to start yourself up.

16:14.480 --> 16:15.520
Mm, now, you don't want
to start yourself up.

16:15.520 --> 16:19.520
But you will need a steady
2,000 calories a day,

16:19.720 --> 16:23.120
plus the appropriate amino acids
from the dairy group.

16:23.120 --> 16:26.200
plus the appropriate amino acids
from the dairy group.

16:26.200 --> 16:29.640
I don't see anything particularly
amusing about this, Mrs Leighton.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.400
I'm sorry, really, I'm sorry.

16:31.400 --> 16:35.400
Now, we all know where our best
source of protein comes from,

16:35.400 --> 16:36.440
do we not?

16:36.440 --> 16:37.680
Of course we do.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.560
Yes, meet Sammy.

16:39.560 --> 16:43.560
(LAUGHS)

16:46.960 --> 16:48.560
Ehrlich, please, stop it.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.720
Oh, I can't stop.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.800
Happy fingers.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.400
This from a man who, this morning,

16:53.400 --> 16:55.520
was moaning that he hadn't
slept in two days.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.560
What's more important

16:56.560 --> 16:58.520
is I haven't slept
with  anyone in two months.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.480
Come on, last Thursday with Emma.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.320
No, no, bunk beds in on-call
do not count.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.880
I still don't understand
why you're so happy.

17:05.880 --> 17:07.000
Because, my friend,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.400
in roughly 20 minutes I'm going
to be cruising into port,

17:09.400 --> 17:11.480
ready to drop anchor.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.960
Now I know how Columbus
felt finding a New World.

17:13.960 --> 17:14.520
You've got a date.

17:14.520 --> 17:18.200
You've got a date.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.920
(CHOKES) With who?

17:20.920 --> 17:22.720
Well, specifics aren't
really important

17:22.720 --> 17:25.640
but I can tell you she is a junior.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.160
You're going out with
a candy striper?

17:28.160 --> 17:30.640
Erlich, have you ever had
a conversation with one of them?

17:30.640 --> 17:33.680
Some of them can barely read!

17:33.680 --> 17:37.680
How can you say that?

17:38.880 --> 17:40.800
Eve's a real slugger.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.200
I was worried, there, for a while

17:42.200 --> 17:44.080
but you should have seen
her this morning.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.400
She snapped out of her
post-op depression

17:46.400 --> 17:48.240
and is raring to get
out of this place.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.360
Can you blame her?

17:49.360 --> 17:50.400
No, I can't!

17:50.400 --> 17:52.120
You know what she
got me to agree to?

17:52.120 --> 17:55.600
Evidently the kids at her school
are confused about the transplant.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.600
I promised to go down there this
week and explain it to them.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.360
The Selman foundation
renewed our grant

18:02.360 --> 18:04.840
only because of the success
of your work.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.280
Well, it's about time.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.960
You mean they've been sleeping
together for over a year?!

18:08.960 --> 18:11.000
Well, you know, evidently,

18:11.000 --> 18:12.760
they knew each other even
before he moved to town.

18:12.760 --> 18:13.800
they knew each other even
before he moved to town.

18:13.800 --> 18:14.880
Who's that?

18:14.880 --> 18:16.240
&lt; Joan Halloran and Bobby Caldwell.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.080
&lt; Joan Halloran and Bobby Caldwell.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.480
Luther Hawkins told me,
also about the accident.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.960
What accident?

18:22.960 --> 18:25.760
Bobby Caldwell was in Halloran's
apartment when he got mugged.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.600
Wait a minute here, wait a minute.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.280
Now, let me get this straight,
Caldwell and Halloran

18:30.280 --> 18:33.320
have been playing, "I've got
a secret," for the past year?!

18:33.320 --> 18:34.840
Hm-mm.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.560
Why am I always the last to know?

18:36.560 --> 18:40.560
Hm-mm-mm.

18:42.520 --> 18:46.520
'Mr Acorn, Mr John Acorn to fourth
floor nurses station.'

18:48.120 --> 18:49.880
Hi, Dad.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.240
Hi!

18:51.240 --> 18:53.120
What are you doing here?

18:53.120 --> 18:54.600
I've got something to tell you.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.440
I've made a decision,
I'm not going to Vassar.

18:58.440 --> 18:59.840
What?

18:59.840 --> 19:03.680
Dad, it's just too expensive,
it's too far away

19:03.680 --> 19:07.680
and, besides, anything I can learn
there I can study right here at BC.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.840
Does this have anything to do with
Mrs Catalano's leaving?

19:11.840 --> 19:14.160
Yeah, kind of.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.800
Lizzie, we'll find
another housekeeper.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.920
Dad, do you really think there are
that many housekeepers out there

19:19.920 --> 19:23.000
that are going to be willing
to take care of an autistic child?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.920
All we need is one.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.720
Don't worry, honey.

19:26.720 --> 19:29.000
I don't know,
it doesn't seem fair, Dad.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.080
I mean, you've spent your whole
life taking care of us

19:31.080 --> 19:34.200
and taking care of patients.

19:34.200 --> 19:38.200
You never seem to take any
time for yourself.

19:38.480 --> 19:40.920
I like my life just the way it is.

19:40.920 --> 19:44.920
I don't know, Dad, the older I get,

19:45.160 --> 19:47.480
I just think you should
date more often.

19:47.480 --> 19:51.160
I don't want you to grow
old all alone.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.080
Sweetheart, it's my choice.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.920
And, for now,
everything is just fine.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.720
Really?  Really.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.880
(OK.)

19:58.880 --> 20:01.520
Well, any time you want to bring
a lady home for the night

20:01.520 --> 20:03.960
it's OK by me.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.360
It is?

20:05.360 --> 20:06.400
Thank you.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.440
I got to get to play practice.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.600
All right, I'll see you at home.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.560
All right, I'll see you at home.

20:11.560 --> 20:12.880
Bye.

20:12.880 --> 20:13.920
Hey.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.040
Please, don't worry about it. &gt;

20:16.040 --> 20:17.880
Tommy and I will be just fine.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.680
OK. Bye.

20:19.680 --> 20:23.680
Bye-bye. &gt;

20:28.480 --> 20:32.360
I've, er, I've thought a lot about
you in the past couple of months.

20:32.360 --> 20:35.560
Yes, yes, that is so funny,
so have I.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.120
Ever since that night in the laundry

20:37.120 --> 20:39.840
I've felt there's something
very special between us.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.680
Well, I had a great time.

20:41.680 --> 20:42.720
Me too.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.560
Thanks.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.920
Whoa, whoa, Roberta, don't rush off!

20:48.920 --> 20:52.800
Don't you want to invite
me in for a cup of coffee?

20:52.800 --> 20:54.800
Oh, yes, oh, OK, come in.

20:54.800 --> 20:58.800
OK.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.960
Let me see now,
you take one lump, is that right?

21:01.960 --> 21:03.440
&lt; Yes, one lump.

21:03.440 --> 21:06.440
What a memory you've got, baby doll!
(CHUCKLES) Oh, you know what?

21:06.440 --> 21:07.480
Cancel, cancel!

21:07.480 --> 21:10.560
Change that to something,
kind of, carbonated, maybe.

21:10.560 --> 21:14.560
Oh, OK.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.000
Yahoo!

21:17.000 --> 21:18.920
Victor, what are you doing?

21:18.920 --> 21:22.160
Just getting comfortable. (CHUCKLES)

21:22.160 --> 21:25.280
Er...no.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.320
No, no, no, erm...

21:27.320 --> 21:29.120
What's the matter? Weak box spring?

21:29.120 --> 21:32.120
Ooh, yeah, kinky.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.360
Up!  What?

21:33.360 --> 21:36.080
You've got the wrong idea, Victor.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.840
No, I don't think I do, hun.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.360
Remember, I'm Dr Positive Influence,
OK?

21:40.360 --> 21:41.760
Even my pal Weiss said that...

21:41.760 --> 21:44.240
Your pal Weiss said that
I should be seeing men

21:44.240 --> 21:46.440
with a soft sexual persona -

21:46.440 --> 21:48.040
you immediately came to our minds.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.280
Let me tell you something
about Weiss for starters,

21:50.280 --> 21:52.000
the guy had a thing for his  mother.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.840
Well, Dr Weiss said that you would
try and impugn his credibility.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.640
What are you talking about?
This guy is a quack.

21:57.640 --> 22:00.840
Victor, I care about you.

22:00.840 --> 22:01.960
I care about you.

22:01.960 --> 22:05.320
And I really want
us to be friends but...

22:05.320 --> 22:08.920
Dr Weiss says that under
no circumstances...

22:08.920 --> 22:11.640
are you and I to have sex.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.760
(EXHALES)

22:13.760 --> 22:17.000
Under  no  circumstances?!

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
(EXHALES) &gt;

22:25.040 --> 22:29.040
I think you should leave now.

22:29.440 --> 22:33.440
Oh, brother.

22:34.400 --> 22:38.400
It's because I'm wearing
a tie, isn't it?

22:39.240 --> 22:43.240
(EXHALES) I'm going to kill Weiss.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.240
&lt; (GASPING AND CHOKING)

22:50.240 --> 22:51.720
She's choking, she's a-aspirate.

22:51.720 --> 22:55.280
Give her suction,
we've got to clear her lungs.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.320
I'll get Craig, where is he?

22:56.320 --> 22:58.440
I'll get Craig, where is he?

22:58.440 --> 23:02.440
(COUGHS)

23:05.600 --> 23:09.600
There's a certain amount of bleeding
from the anterior suture line.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.920
BUZZER SOUNDS

23:13.920 --> 23:16.160
'Get that.'

23:16.160 --> 23:19.280
Dr Craig, we need you
in Eve Leighton's room.

23:19.280 --> 23:22.240
You'll have to wait, I'm at the most
crucial part of the bypass.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.200
Mrs Leighton may have aspirated.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.680
&lt; She vomited and is having
difficulty breathing.

23:27.680 --> 23:31.680
&lt; What you want to do?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.760
Check the board. Get me another
surgeon to take over here.

23:34.760 --> 23:38.760
Right away.

23:41.360 --> 23:43.000
How's the pulse?

23:43.000 --> 23:44.320
Still no response.

23:44.320 --> 23:48.320
Another amp of bicarb.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.040
&lt; 300 milligrams.

23:53.040 --> 23:56.040
Come on, Eve.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.880
BUZZER SOUNDS

23:57.880 --> 24:01.880
I'm sorry, Dr Craig, no-one else is
available and Mrs Leighton's coded.

24:03.440 --> 24:04.840
Dammit!

24:04.840 --> 24:05.880
Suction.

24:05.880 --> 24:09.880
&lt; Clear.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.800
MONITOR FLATLINES

24:13.800 --> 24:15.880
Clear.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.280
Wait five minutes,
then close if it's still dry.

24:18.280 --> 24:22.280
Trudy, give me a hand here.

24:58.520 --> 25:02.520
Apparently she'd been vomiting
and had a productive cough.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.800
Why wasn't it charted?

25:06.800 --> 25:10.800
She didn't tell anybody
except one nurse's aide.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.880
I guess she was just
so anxious to go home.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.360
She went very fast, Dr Craig.

25:18.360 --> 25:22.080
We kept the code going
for 30 minutes.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.960
I'll call the family.

25:23.960 --> 25:27.960
No, I'll do it.

26:12.360 --> 26:16.360
'Dr Romano, Dr Josef Romano
to second floor nurses' station.'

26:29.440 --> 26:31.640
I'll buy this magazine.

26:31.640 --> 26:35.640
Important to keep track for the fast
breaking trends in medicine.

26:36.160 --> 26:39.560
Keep the change, doll.

26:39.560 --> 26:40.800
Victor, Victor!

26:40.800 --> 26:42.080
Call me Dr Erlich.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.280
Thought you told me to call you...?

26:43.280 --> 26:44.680
Thought you told me to call you...?

26:44.680 --> 26:47.960
So, what's your problem, son?
Need me to save a life?

26:47.960 --> 26:49.120
No, it's parking.

26:49.120 --> 26:52.040
The security guard won't let me park
in the lot reserved for doctors.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.480
That's because you're not a doctor,
your a med student, you're nothing!

26:54.480 --> 26:55.800
That's because you're not a doctor,
your a med student, you're nothing!

26:55.800 --> 26:59.080
I mean, Dr Erlich, with Dr Caldwell
getting beaten up and everything

26:59.080 --> 27:00.600
I was afraid to park
my car anywhere else.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.240
I was afraid to park
my car anywhere else.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.040
I'm still paying for
my student loans.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.560
Well, my cousin Pee-Wee has
a Datsun dealership so...

27:06.560 --> 27:09.080
Look, Elliot, you're never going
to make it as a doctor here

27:09.080 --> 27:12.000
unless you get your mind out of the
parking lot and your butt to the ER!

27:12.000 --> 27:12.720
My car's in the middle
of the street...

27:12.720 --> 27:14.800
My car's in the middle
of the street...

27:14.800 --> 27:17.520
&lt; I'm talking life-and-death! I've
just spent six hours in OR

27:17.520 --> 27:20.400
adding 16 years to a man's life.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.440
Yes, sir.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.320
Thank you, sir.

27:23.320 --> 27:24.360
Dr Ehrlich?

27:24.360 --> 27:27.360
Wayne, I mean, Dr Fiscus
wanted me to tell you

27:27.360 --> 27:29.280
he needed you right away in the ER.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.640
Oh, something Fiscus can't
handle alone, huh?

27:31.640 --> 27:35.120
No, he said it was your turn
to change the colostomy bags.

27:35.120 --> 27:39.120
Get out of here, Elliot. Right now.
Get out, get out.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.800
Oh, no, no, this one's on me.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.480
Oh, he's cute!

27:43.480 --> 27:46.520
Thanks.

27:46.520 --> 27:49.440
Do you really have to be so rough
on the medical students?

27:49.440 --> 27:52.080
It's the only thing that'll
make them great doctors.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.480
Dr Weiss was right.

27:53.480 --> 27:56.440
He said you'd try all sorts of stupid
behaviour to try and impress me.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.520
Weiss again? Come on!

27:58.520 --> 28:00.600
No! Oh, no, Victor,
I think it's very sweet.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.000
I mean, that you care that much.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.360
Well, I do, Roberta.

28:03.360 --> 28:07.360
Well, then believe me,
I like you just as you are.

28:08.400 --> 28:11.600
I mean, you don't have to dress up
or act tough or sexy.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.280
I like the person underneath.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.360
The natural you.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.840
Natural, huh?,

28:16.840 --> 28:17.880
Completely natural?

28:17.880 --> 28:18.960
Uh-huh.

28:18.960 --> 28:22.400
Oh!

28:22.400 --> 28:23.680
What's this?

28:23.680 --> 28:24.800
A key to my apartment.

28:24.800 --> 28:25.840
Great!

28:25.840 --> 28:29.360
Er, Victor, I'd like you to stop
by tomorrow so we can talk.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.400
Fine.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.000
I'm coming in from Brookline

28:32.000 --> 28:33.960
and you can't depend
on the T with all the snow.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.760
Well, I wouldn't want you to get
locked out like you did last time.

28:35.760 --> 28:36.800
Well, I wouldn't want you to get
locked out like you did last time.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.000
OK.  (CHUCKLES)

28:38.000 --> 28:41.320
Oh...

28:41.320 --> 28:42.360
That's for you.

28:42.360 --> 28:43.560
You're kidding?

28:43.560 --> 28:45.120
So cute.

28:45.120 --> 28:49.120
Bye!

28:53.240 --> 28:55.840
So, I thought on Saturday
we'd go down to the Navy Yard

28:55.840 --> 28:59.840
and I'll show you
the USS Constitution.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
My dad took me there when I was
just about your age.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.840
How does that sound?

29:06.840 --> 29:10.840
And tomorrow we're going to go visit
Dr Carlisle at the hospital.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.080
It's time for your physical.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.720
She's looking forward to seeing you.

29:16.720 --> 29:20.720
Let's skip the salt and butter, OK?

29:20.880 --> 29:24.640
That's looking pretty good, son.

29:24.640 --> 29:28.640
Think we should finish it together?

29:29.280 --> 29:32.960
How's that?

29:32.960 --> 29:36.960
Here, have some pop corn.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.640
We have to talk about
something, son.

29:44.640 --> 29:47.720
Man to man.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.920
Do you remember when Mrs Catalano

29:49.920 --> 29:52.960
went to visit her
granddaughter in Buffalo?

29:52.960 --> 29:56.960
She was gone two weeks and we all
pitched in and we did just fine.

29:59.400 --> 30:02.760
Well, Mr Catalano
is going away again.

30:02.760 --> 30:06.760
This time for a lot longer.

30:06.920 --> 30:10.920
She has a sister in Italy,
just like you have Lizzie.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.880
And she wants to live with her.

30:14.880 --> 30:18.880
Do you understand?

30:28.600 --> 30:32.560
I know it's sad, son, but we're
going to be just fine. Don't worry.

30:32.560 --> 30:36.560
(WHIMPERS)

30:46.480 --> 30:49.080
EKG show bifascicular
two-to-one block

30:49.080 --> 30:51.760
with an occasional
ventricular ectopia.

30:51.760 --> 30:52.920
And your plan?

30:52.920 --> 30:54.520
Pacemaker insertion.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.040
Excellent.

30:56.040 --> 30:59.360
Dr Wade will explain the procedure
later, Mr McMullan.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.320
Don't worry, we'll take
good care of you.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.840
We'll get a urological consult
after the pacemaker is in

31:05.840 --> 31:08.560
for a probable
Small-Carrion prosthesis.

31:08.560 --> 31:09.600
Yes, sir.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.400
Anyone have any questions?

31:11.400 --> 31:15.400
All right.

31:20.640 --> 31:24.640
Dr Craig, I just wanted to say how
sorry I am...about Eve Leighton.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.720
It was a loss for all of us.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.880
It was also an extraordinary
experience.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.680
The new heart
was functioning perfectly.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.960
Your work was a success.

31:36.960 --> 31:40.960
Thank you.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.600
Well, maybe we'd better just
forget it then, I guess.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.920
Of course, if you want
to play catch?

31:46.920 --> 31:47.960
No, sir.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.360
Me either.

31:50.360 --> 31:54.120
I really don't know what you
expect from me, sir.

31:54.120 --> 31:58.120
I got a little something
for you to remind you of home.

32:02.760 --> 32:06.760
Open it, it's yours.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.160
Thank you, Dr Ridley.

32:12.160 --> 32:15.400
I've been reading all about the
Orange parade in that book there.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.520
To celebrate William's
victory at the Boyne.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.560
It's a big holiday.

32:18.560 --> 32:22.120
What, is it anything
like our Thanksgiving Day parade

32:22.120 --> 32:24.240
with floats and majorettes?

32:24.240 --> 32:27.600
Nah, it's much more
serious than that.

32:27.600 --> 32:31.120
My stepfather used to carry the drum
through the festival archways.

32:31.120 --> 32:33.080
The drum, like in the picture book?

32:33.080 --> 32:35.400
Yes, and he banged
on it with bamboo canes

32:35.400 --> 32:37.920
tied to his wrists
with leather straps.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.280
At the end of the day
he'd beat it so fiercely

32:40.280 --> 32:43.960
his arms would be all cut up.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.120
But the sound of that drum

32:46.120 --> 32:49.480
throws fear into the hearts
of all Catholics.

32:49.480 --> 32:50.960
And what about you?

32:50.960 --> 32:53.640
What would you do on that day?

32:53.640 --> 32:54.760
Pray, of course!

32:54.760 --> 32:58.760
And help to build a bonfire
to burn the Pope in effigy.

32:59.160 --> 33:00.880
And sing.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.080
Sing?

33:02.080 --> 33:03.400
What?

33:03.400 --> 33:07.400
What would you sing?

33:11.040 --> 33:14.560
# Loyal Ulstermen unite

33:14.560 --> 33:18.560
# For Ulster's cause is right

33:18.600 --> 33:20.880
# There is danger still

33:20.880 --> 33:24.880
# Our enemies are never far away

33:26.680 --> 33:30.680
# But the Orange men united stand
Are ready for the fray

33:35.160 --> 33:39.160
# But if we turn our backs

33:39.280 --> 33:43.280
# The enemy would strike... #

33:49.800 --> 33:53.800
I used to sing that song long before
I knew what the words meant.

33:53.920 --> 33:57.720
Eddie?

33:57.720 --> 34:01.680
I talked with your uncle before
he died and he told me...

34:01.680 --> 34:05.680
all about the bus depot in Belfast
and all the people that you killed.

34:07.960 --> 34:11.960
I never should have
moved to the city.

34:12.199 --> 34:15.440
What was it like, Eddie?

34:15.440 --> 34:19.440
Can you remember what it felt
like when it happened?

34:22.280 --> 34:26.280
# But if we turn our backs

34:27.040 --> 34:31.040
# The enemy would strike

34:32.600 --> 34:36.600
# But Ulstermen will fight
For Ulster's cause... #

34:47.040 --> 34:48.239
(SNIFFS)

34:48.239 --> 34:52.239
I swerved to miss Brennan
the second time.

34:53.040 --> 34:57.040
I smashed into the wall on purpose
to avoid hitting him.

34:59.440 --> 35:02.480
I didn't want him to die.

35:02.480 --> 35:05.760
I didn't want any of them to die.

35:05.760 --> 35:09.120
I believe you, Eddie.

35:09.120 --> 35:13.120
I really do.

35:14.320 --> 35:18.320
But we can't pretend
that it didn't happen.

35:21.400 --> 35:25.320
They killed my brother.

35:25.320 --> 35:28.200
And I killed them...

35:28.200 --> 35:32.200
and their brothers will kill me.

35:32.360 --> 35:35.400
We're fighting for a land
that is rocky and barren,

35:35.400 --> 35:39.400
no-one really wants.

35:40.360 --> 35:42.280
Babies freeze to death

35:42.280 --> 35:46.280
and, instead of digging up peat
for fuel, we dig graves.

35:47.720 --> 35:51.720
It's, it's a place I hate...and...

35:53.560 --> 35:55.120
(Sorry, Eddie.)

35:55.120 --> 35:59.120
(I'm sorry, I really am.)

36:03.280 --> 36:07.280
I miss my mother.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.520
SAW BUZZES

36:29.520 --> 36:32.000
Oh, no, hey!
Come on, I'm alive. See...

36:32.000 --> 36:32.880
Victor!

36:32.880 --> 36:34.600
Victor!

36:34.600 --> 36:35.680
What are you doing here?!

36:35.680 --> 36:36.880
What are you doing here?!

36:36.880 --> 36:37.640
Waiting for me?

36:37.640 --> 36:40.280
Waiting for me?

36:40.280 --> 36:42.600
Erm, phew, I need your advice.

36:42.600 --> 36:43.880
Advice, from me?

36:43.880 --> 36:46.280
Yeah. What, is there an echo
in here, or something?

36:46.280 --> 36:48.480
I don't know, is there? Hello?

36:48.480 --> 36:51.240
What, no. Try and stay with me,
Cathy, OK? Please.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.440
And put that saw down, come on!

36:53.440 --> 36:57.320
Erm, I talked to guys about this
but they've been absolutely no help.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.000
I need an expert opinion.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.680
Is this pathological?

37:01.680 --> 37:03.200
In a way, I suppose.

37:03.200 --> 37:06.840
Erm, you see, there's this
girl and I'm nuts about her.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.280
She wants to be friends,

37:08.280 --> 37:10.960
I want it to be much more than that,
you understand?

37:10.960 --> 37:12.760
So do I, Victor.

37:12.760 --> 37:16.000
So, I'm not sure what, quite,
to do with it because, you know,

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
&lt; her perception of me is just
a step left of being a eunuch.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.280
That's not true.

37:24.280 --> 37:27.640
I know that, tell it to Roberta.

37:27.640 --> 37:28.800
Who's Roberta?

37:28.800 --> 37:31.760
The girl I'm in love with, you want
flashcards? Listen to me, Roberta.

37:31.760 --> 37:35.120
Oh! Well...

37:35.120 --> 37:38.640
Well, what has Roberta said
to you about all this?

37:38.640 --> 37:41.240
A-ha, she said she wants
the natural me.

37:41.240 --> 37:42.480
&lt; Now, what do you think?

37:42.480 --> 37:43.760
Natural?

37:43.760 --> 37:46.080
That was her word?

37:46.080 --> 37:48.440
Seems pretty obvious.
All the signals are there.

37:48.440 --> 37:52.440
OK, but the last time
I made a move she burned me.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.680
Kinky.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.240
Psychologically, Cathy.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.520
Oh.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.680
Seems to me like she is ready now.

37:59.680 --> 38:00.920
Tonight is crucial.

38:00.920 --> 38:03.680
Whatever you do,
this is your last chance.

38:03.680 --> 38:04.920
This is the last chance?

38:04.920 --> 38:06.320
To do something,

38:06.320 --> 38:10.320
to really show her just how unique
you think your relationship is.

38:11.040 --> 38:14.000
Well, tell me, what would you do?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.880
Oh, Victor...

38:15.880 --> 38:19.160
Come on, our secret.

38:19.160 --> 38:23.160
Well...some girls like
to be lavished with gifts.

38:23.520 --> 38:25.200
Sounds familiar.

38:25.200 --> 38:29.200
I like to be lavished with cream.

38:29.800 --> 38:30.840
PAGER BEEPS

38:30.840 --> 38:33.280
Whoa! There goes old
to Mr Beeper, huh?

38:33.280 --> 38:34.440
I got to run, doll.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.880
Thanks to you, thank you,
thank you very much.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.920
We're almost done. &gt;

38:38.920 --> 38:40.280
Open your mouth.

38:40.280 --> 38:44.280
Open your mouth, Tommy.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.400
How do they look? &gt;

38:50.400 --> 38:51.720
Good.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.080
Let's step in here for a second.

38:53.080 --> 38:57.080
You can put your
clothes on now, Tommy.

38:57.800 --> 39:01.800
Be right back, sport.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.640
Physically he's fine, Donald,

39:05.640 --> 39:08.600
but I don't think I've seen him
this unresponsive in years.

39:08.600 --> 39:11.560
Yeah, well, he's a little mad
at the world these days.

39:11.560 --> 39:13.680
Our housekeeper's
leaving us for good.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.440
Hm, that's certainly not going
to help the home situation.

39:16.440 --> 39:20.280
Well, I had a talk with Mrs Elway,
over at his school, and she agrees

39:20.280 --> 39:23.000
that he doesn't need full-time
supervision at home any more.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.600
As long as we start some
kind of movement or art therapy.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.720
Listen, Donald,
I've known you a long time,

39:28.720 --> 39:32.720
I...certainly don't want to tell
you how to run your life

39:32.840 --> 39:35.400
but, as Tommy's Doctor, I think,
maybe, you should consider

39:35.400 --> 39:38.360
sending him to a boarding school
for special children.

39:38.360 --> 39:40.240
Never.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.640
You've done everything
in your power to reach him

39:42.640 --> 39:44.280
for the last eight years.

39:44.280 --> 39:46.960
Mary, there are no heroics here,

39:46.960 --> 39:50.560
I just want my son to have as full
and normal a life as possible

39:50.560 --> 39:52.800
and I can't see that happening
if I ship him off

39:52.800 --> 39:56.240
to some institution somewhere.
It's as simple as that.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.640
I understand.

39:57.640 --> 40:01.640
I'd better get him back to school.
Thanks for your concern, Mary.

40:04.240 --> 40:08.240
Oh, boy!

40:08.360 --> 40:12.360
Tommy?

40:14.280 --> 40:15.720
(EXHALES)

40:15.720 --> 40:17.160
Do you want me to call security?

40:17.160 --> 40:19.760
No, he was raised in this hospital.
He knows it inside and out.

40:19.760 --> 40:22.400
Besides, the way he feels, the last
thing I want is to scare him.

40:22.400 --> 40:23.840
I'll find him myself, thanks.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.080
Helen, have you seen Tommy?

40:25.080 --> 40:26.640
You just missed him,
he went towards your office.

40:26.640 --> 40:30.640
You just missed him,
he went towards your office.

40:40.080 --> 40:41.280
'Oh, come on, lady.'

40:41.280 --> 40:45.280
Waiting is a nightmare.

40:45.400 --> 40:49.000
Can't choke now, main event.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
(EXHALES) Wait a minute.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.200
Wants the natural me, huh?

40:56.200 --> 41:00.200
(LAUGHS) To Victor go the spoils.

41:00.440 --> 41:04.440
Ooh!

41:08.320 --> 41:10.120
Dr Westphall.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.880
Come here for a minute.

41:11.880 --> 41:15.880
TOY PLAYS
WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR

41:32.360 --> 41:36.360
Come on, son, it's time to go.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.920
Mom left Tommy...

41:41.920 --> 41:44.640
..Mrs Catalano left Tommy...

41:44.640 --> 41:47.120
..Lizzie leaving Tommy...

41:47.120 --> 41:49.520
You leave Tommy, Dad?

41:49.520 --> 41:53.520
Wouldn't leave you for anything.

42:06.280 --> 42:08.960
What is this,
some kind of vacuum cleaner?

42:08.960 --> 42:11.880
&lt; Victor? Victor, are you here?

42:11.880 --> 42:15.880
Oh, boy, here goes nothing.

42:16.560 --> 42:17.680
Victor?

42:17.680 --> 42:20.400
Er, I'm in here, Roberta.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.680
What are you doing in the closet?

42:22.680 --> 42:25.520
Well, he said you were in love
with the real, natural me,

42:25.520 --> 42:28.040
so, here I come!

42:28.040 --> 42:29.880
Ta-da! (CHUCKLES)

42:29.880 --> 42:31.440
Victor.

42:31.440 --> 42:34.320
Yes?

42:34.320 --> 42:37.920
You know Dr Weiss, don't you?

42:37.920 --> 42:39.680
(GASPS)

42:39.680 --> 42:41.760
Yes.

42:41.760 --> 42:42.800
Good to see you.

42:42.800 --> 42:45.800
(EXHALES)

42:45.800 --> 42:49.800
OK.

42:57.400 --> 43:01.400
BABY GURGLES

43:06.600 --> 43:09.000
Oh, in the name of the Lord!

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
You're getting big.

43:13.320 --> 43:16.000
I'm sorry, Dr Craig.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.040
You want me to take him?

43:17.040 --> 43:19.280
No, not at all.

43:19.280 --> 43:23.120
It's been years
since I've held a baby.

43:23.120 --> 43:24.520
(CHUCKLES)

43:24.520 --> 43:27.080
I was looking for you.

43:27.080 --> 43:31.080
You've heard about Eve Leighton,
I suppose?

43:32.360 --> 43:35.880
It must be strange for you too.

43:35.880 --> 43:39.880
It's like having Nina die twice.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.760
Oh, Jack.

43:43.760 --> 43:47.760
I feel like I've let everyone down -
you and Nina included.

43:47.760 --> 43:50.360
No, no, no, no.
What more could you do?

43:50.360 --> 43:53.480
I wasn't even there.

43:53.480 --> 43:55.720
I couldn't get to her.

43:55.720 --> 43:58.280
I was in the middle
of doing a bypass.

43:58.280 --> 44:02.280
Extending someone else's life.

44:05.840 --> 44:09.840
(There you go.)

44:12.160 --> 44:16.120
You know, standing over that
man's chest, worrying about Eve,

44:16.120 --> 44:20.120
I stopped for a second,
looked at my hands...

44:22.600 --> 44:26.600
..and marvelled at the intricacies
of the human body.

44:28.520 --> 44:32.520
To take a vein from the leg of a man
and connect it to his heart

44:32.800 --> 44:36.800
and then to see him
a year or so later...

44:37.120 --> 44:40.880
..leading an active life...

44:40.880 --> 44:43.800
..or to take a disintegrating
heart, like Eve's,

44:43.800 --> 44:47.800
and replace it with one as strong
and as vibrant as your wife's...

44:50.120 --> 44:54.120
..well, you feel like God.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.800
And then it doesn't take

44:56.800 --> 45:00.800
and then you very quickly
realise...you're only a man.

45:03.920 --> 45:07.920
I know how you feel.

45:07.920 --> 45:10.280
I've got to get going.
I'm going over to the wake.

45:10.280 --> 45:13.240
Are you going
to the funeral tomorrow?

45:13.240 --> 45:14.600
Yes, of course.

45:14.600 --> 45:18.600
Would you mind if I go with you?

45:19.560 --> 45:23.560
I'd like that.

45:27.240 --> 45:30.920
My father was a very
famous surgeon, you know...

45:30.920 --> 45:34.640
..and I can remember,
when I was growing up, asking him,

45:34.640 --> 45:36.160
"Why do people die?",

45:36.160 --> 45:40.160
And he said, "That's why you
should become a doctor."

45:42.760 --> 45:46.760
And now, after all the years
of training and practice,

45:47.640 --> 45:51.640
I know how people die...

45:52.280 --> 45:56.280
..but I still don't know why.

46:41.920 --> 46:49.000
