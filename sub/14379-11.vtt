Come on, Dex.
Don't want to be late.

00:55.366 --> 00:57.316
Dexter: Coming.

00:57.350 --> 00:59.100
So, anyway,
I was 3 under.

00:59.133 --> 01:00.216
This is down
at the pines.

01:00.250 --> 01:03.350
Here we are, son.
Welcome to the pro shop.

01:03.383 --> 01:06.200
Hey, how's it going, guys?

01:06.233 --> 01:10.250
You know, the am shop
is back that way.

01:10.283 --> 01:12.150
[Laughing]

01:12.183 --> 01:14.183
What's that,
guys?

01:14.216 --> 01:15.483
Have a good game.

01:16.016 --> 01:17.450
Hey! Yeah.
You, too,
fellas.

01:17.483 --> 01:19.133
Good
to see you.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.050
[Coughs]
Poo bird.

01:21.083 --> 01:24.133
[Laughing]

01:24.166 --> 01:26.000
Uh!

01:27.166 --> 01:29.133
[Laughing]

01:29.166 --> 01:34.366
Dad, do those guys think
you're funny or something?

01:34.400 --> 01:36.183
What's that?
Oh, yeah.

01:36.216 --> 01:40.083
We're always
clowning around
here. Ha ha!

01:40.116 --> 01:42.116
Well, if you say so.

01:42.150 --> 01:45.066
[Laughing]

01:45.100 --> 01:47.450
Oh, there you are.
Excuse me.

01:47.483 --> 01:49.033
Yeah?

01:49.066 --> 01:50.316
What can I
do you for?

01:50.350 --> 01:52.266
I'm gonna need
a cart, please.

01:52.300 --> 01:55.050
Oh, a cart, huh?

01:55.083 --> 01:57.050
[Hiss]

01:57.083 --> 01:59.200
[Hiss]

01:59.233 --> 02:03.333
Sorry.
We're all out.

02:06.016 --> 02:09.283
Well, what about
those ones outside?

02:09.316 --> 02:12.250
Sir, are you
calling me a liar?

02:12.283 --> 02:14.316
What's
the problem
here, Billy?

02:14.350 --> 02:17.083
No problem, sir.
Everything's fine.

02:17.116 --> 02:18.316
Yeah, well,
let's just try

02:18.350 --> 02:21.050
to keep the ruckus
to a minimum, ok?

02:21.083 --> 02:23.216
Sure, boss.
Anything you say.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.283
Thanks, Billy.

02:25.316 --> 02:27.433
What, are you trying
to get me fired?!

02:27.466 --> 02:33.050
Well, I've never been
one to cause a ruckus.

02:35.033 --> 02:36.333
Come on, Dex.

02:36.366 --> 02:38.033
Hey, wait.

02:38.066 --> 02:42.066
I might be able
to help you out.

02:43.233 --> 02:46.216
See? You come to a place
long enough, Dex,

02:46.250 --> 02:51.216
and you start to earn
a little respect.

02:51.250 --> 02:54.316
Who are you
paired up with?

02:56.300 --> 02:59.116
Hey, guys.

02:59.466 --> 03:02.083
[Laughing]

03:07.450 --> 03:09.333
Ok, step aside, gents,

03:09.366 --> 03:16.216
because no one is standing
between me and that trophy.

03:16.250 --> 03:19.250
It's tee time.

03:20.066 --> 03:21.483
Ball, caddie.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.300
Thanks.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.483
Caddie, wash
this ball, please.

03:32.016 --> 03:34.433
It's filthy.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.300
Thanks.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.350
Hmm...

03:57.233 --> 03:59.050
Darn these cheap tees!

03:59.083 --> 04:02.000
Psst! Hey, dad,
aren't you supposed to--

04:02.033 --> 04:06.116
not now, caddie.
I'm trying
to concentrate.

04:07.183 --> 04:09.216
Shh.

04:09.483 --> 04:12.083
Here. Why don't you
try this one?

04:12.116 --> 04:14.416
It's from<i>Australia.</i>

04:14.450 --> 04:19.183
Ooh! Thanks, mate.

04:19.216 --> 04:22.383
[Laughing]

04:27.050 --> 04:30.333
The shrimp's
on the Barbie, fellas.

04:33.383 --> 04:37.300
Let's get
down to business.

04:41.050 --> 04:44.333
Is, uh...He
gonna kill us?

04:44.366 --> 04:46.200
Club, caddie.

04:46.233 --> 04:48.400
Thank you very--

04:51.233 --> 04:53.133
uh, excuse me,
caddie,

04:53.166 --> 04:54.333
but we're
a long way

04:54.366 --> 04:56.150
from that hole
over there.

04:56.183 --> 04:57.333
We're gonna need
something

04:57.366 --> 05:00.066
a bit more
substantial
than wood.

05:00.100 --> 05:04.283
We're gonna need
cold steel!

05:05.216 --> 05:07.416
Ah! Here we go.

05:07.450 --> 05:10.250
But, dad,
that's a putter.

05:10.283 --> 05:11.450
[Ahem]

05:11.483 --> 05:14.266
Caddie. Daddy.

05:14.300 --> 05:17.166
He's steppin' up
to the plate.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.000
He's at the plate!

05:20.033 --> 05:22.400
[Snoring]

05:22.433 --> 05:25.100
And here's the wind-up!

05:25.133 --> 05:28.033
Hey, b-b-b-b-b!

05:30.333 --> 05:34.216
All right,
that's a penalty.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.150
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

05:36.183 --> 05:37.350
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

05:37.383 --> 05:40.166
Wait, dad.
He said "penalty."

05:40.200 --> 05:41.283
No, he didn't, son.

05:41.316 --> 05:44.133
He said, "now
you're home free."

05:44.166 --> 05:45.250
Um...

05:45.283 --> 05:48.366
Just watch me, son.
You might learn
something.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.050
Ok, dad.

05:50.083 --> 05:54.466
Now watch me
pick up that spare.

05:57.016 --> 06:00.283
Man! That thing
is out of the park!

06:00.316 --> 06:03.016
[Laughing]

06:05.150 --> 06:07.450
There's
a stroke.

06:09.050 --> 06:10.016
Yeah!

06:10.050 --> 06:12.350
Dad, he said,
"that's a stroke."

06:12.383 --> 06:16.016
Son, please.
He said, "now
you're stoked."

06:16.050 --> 06:20.066
Please, Grant
this child brains.

06:22.450 --> 06:25.333
I'm gonna kill that
brother-in-law
of yours

06:25.366 --> 06:27.133
for not showing up
today.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.333
Dad: All right,
pay attention, ladies.

06:29.366 --> 06:32.066
I am gonna show you
a little technique

06:32.100 --> 06:34.016
I learned
back in the war.

06:34.050 --> 06:38.150
It's called...
Phlargle-blarger.

06:40.383 --> 06:43.033
Ooh...

06:43.066 --> 06:46.033
Yah...

06:46.066 --> 06:48.283
Yes, he is.

06:48.316 --> 06:49.233
What?

06:49.266 --> 06:50.400
Going
to kill us.

06:50.433 --> 06:52.266
Phlargle-blarger!

06:57.483 --> 07:01.350
No, no, no. I didn't
do that right at all.

07:01.383 --> 07:05.033
It almost fell into
this little hole right here.

07:05.066 --> 07:08.016
All right,
that's a do-over.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.233
Dad, listen
to me--

07:10.266 --> 07:12.316
no more.

07:13.283 --> 07:16.200
I don't want
any more nonsense today

07:16.233 --> 07:18.083
from anybody,

07:18.116 --> 07:21.016
and that includes me.

07:22.283 --> 07:24.216
Phlargle-blarger!

07:26.233 --> 07:28.150
Ha ha ha ha.

07:28.183 --> 07:29.250
Well, it's official.

07:29.283 --> 07:32.400
Now you're gonna
need a hole-in-one

07:32.433 --> 07:34.033
on the next 17 holes

07:34.066 --> 07:36.100
if you even
want to get close

07:36.133 --> 07:37.483
to winning
that trophy.

07:38.016 --> 07:40.016
[Laughing]

07:40.166 --> 07:43.016
No one's ever done that
except chief bearpart--

07:43.050 --> 07:45.150
the horseshoe bend open
of 1914,

07:45.183 --> 07:50.300
and he was using balls
made out of candle wax.

07:51.033 --> 07:52.250
Nerd alert!

07:52.283 --> 07:53.483
[Laughing]

07:54.016 --> 07:57.400
So, it's a hole-in-one
you want, is it?

07:57.433 --> 07:58.366
Dad--

07:58.400 --> 08:02.266
well, I'll give you
a hole in 8!

08:03.266 --> 08:05.133
Oh. Ha!

08:05.166 --> 08:08.116
I got you this time!

08:08.150 --> 08:13.000
Dad is going to lose
unless I do something fast.

08:13.183 --> 08:18.016
Wait a minute. Ooh.
I hope it's still there.

08:18.050 --> 08:19.350
Aha!

08:25.100 --> 08:26.400
Excuse me, sir,
but I need

08:26.433 --> 08:28.150
to clean this ball.

08:28.183 --> 08:29.400
Here is a fresh one,

08:29.433 --> 08:31.150
clean as a whistle.

08:31.183 --> 08:32.433
Nope, nothing wrong

08:32.466 --> 08:34.133
with this ball.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.466
Perfectly normal ball

08:36.000 --> 08:38.033
right there.

08:38.466 --> 08:41.000
[Ahem]

08:45.333 --> 08:48.300
[Beeping]

09:03.466 --> 09:06.016
Well, 18 more
to go.

09:06.050 --> 09:07.383
17, dad.

09:17.433 --> 09:22.016
Yah...

09:24.083 --> 09:26.166
[Beeping]

09:51.366 --> 09:55.216
Well, one more hole,
and I win the trophy.

09:55.250 --> 09:58.383
Wait a second.
I can't use this ball.

09:58.416 --> 10:00.350
It's covered in filth.

10:00.383 --> 10:02.433
No! Wait!
Dad, don't!

10:02.466 --> 10:05.100
Don't worry, caddie.
I'll wash it.

10:05.133 --> 10:07.300
Please! I have to
tell you something!

10:07.333 --> 10:10.316
Save it till
after the game, son.

10:10.350 --> 10:13.233
Can't you see
I'm about to win?

10:13.266 --> 10:14.366
[Crackling]

10:14.400 --> 10:16.200
[Boom]

10:16.400 --> 10:21.166
This ball seems
to have run its course.

10:22.250 --> 10:25.000
Well, I got
another one.

10:25.033 --> 10:27.250
Dad, wait!

10:38.300 --> 10:40.366
[Cheering]

10:42.083 --> 10:43.350
[Thud]

10:43.383 --> 10:47.033
Now, what was that
you wanted to tell
me, son?

10:47.066 --> 10:51.200
Uh...thanks for letting me
be your caddie today.

10:51.233 --> 10:54.316
You're welcome, son.

11:02.450 --> 11:04.100
Announcer:
And here they are,

11:04.133 --> 11:06.416
the world's most daredevil group
of daffy drivers

11:06.450 --> 11:09.466
ever to whirl their wheels
in<i>Dexter's wacky races,</i>

11:10.000 --> 11:13.316
competing for the title
of the world's wackiest racer.

11:13.350 --> 11:16.433
The cars are approaching
the starting line.

11:16.466 --> 11:20.016
At the front is
that ingenious inventor Dexter

11:20.050 --> 11:21.083
in the laboratory rat,

11:21.116 --> 11:24.033
followed by number 2,
the dark man special,

11:24.066 --> 11:25.233
driven by mandark.

11:25.266 --> 11:27.316
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

11:27.350 --> 11:28.383
[Tires screech]

11:28.416 --> 11:31.050
Tagging alone,
it's number 3 with mom and dad

11:31.083 --> 11:32.316
in the family sedan...

11:32.350 --> 11:34.416
Followed by number 4,
the merry prankster,

11:34.450 --> 11:38.300
driven by mandark's folks,
ocean bird and wind bear.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.466
Right on.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.133
Hopping along, it's number 5,
Dee Dee and koosie.

11:43.166 --> 11:46.033
Next is number 6,
the banana barge,

11:46.066 --> 11:51.433
with monkey...
And the lovely honeydew.

11:52.433 --> 11:54.250
And finally,
in their hemi-powered,

11:54.283 --> 11:57.400
star-spangled superstock,
it's the justice friends--

11:57.433 --> 12:00.333
krunk, major glory,
and val halen,

12:00.366 --> 12:03.366
in the glory lorry.

12:04.416 --> 12:06.300
And away they go,

12:06.333 --> 12:11.166
in<i>Dexter's way-out</i>
<i>wacky races!</i>

12:11.200 --> 12:14.200
Taking the lead,
it's number 3, the family sedan,

12:14.233 --> 12:15.450
in today's wacky race,
which takes us

12:15.483 --> 12:20.133
on a windy, wound-about way
through wonderful wurwank--

12:20.166 --> 12:22.166
Burbank.

12:24.150 --> 12:26.300
In second place,
the merry prankster,

12:26.333 --> 12:28.483
followed by number 2,
the lab rat, in third.

12:29.016 --> 12:33.000
Coming up fast, it's number 2,
the dark man special.

12:33.033 --> 12:34.333
Hmm...i wonder

12:34.366 --> 12:38.016
what that mischievous
mandark is up to.

12:38.050 --> 12:40.416
[Evil laughter]

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Uh-oh. Look out, Dexter.

12:49.033 --> 12:51.150
[Evil laughter]

12:51.183 --> 12:52.183
[Clang]

12:52.216 --> 12:54.016
Huh?

12:54.050 --> 12:55.033
Well, look at that.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.016
It looks like mandark's
monster magnet

12:57.050 --> 12:59.200
was mistakenly set
to "moose."

12:59.233 --> 13:00.383
Ha ha ha ha!

13:00.416 --> 13:02.383
But Dexter's ahead of the game,
maneuvering for the lead,

13:02.416 --> 13:06.016
with the aid of the lab rat's
latest technological advances.

13:06.050 --> 13:10.116
Gee, Dexter, that's
a pretty nifty looking device.

13:10.150 --> 13:11.283
It is my latest foray

13:11.316 --> 13:13.416
into transient
motion graphics
interface technology.

13:13.450 --> 13:17.016
Using negative feedback
synthesized digital
simulator

13:17.050 --> 13:19.266
nominal-space subsystem
linear processing, i--

13:19.300 --> 13:22.133
announcer: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's very nice.

13:22.166 --> 13:23.316
Number 5 is
looking chipper.

13:23.350 --> 13:25.166
How are you
holding up, koos?

13:25.200 --> 13:28.116
Oh, just...Fine.

13:28.150 --> 13:29.316
Yay!

13:39.450 --> 13:41.416
[Squawk]

13:41.450 --> 13:42.383
Hey!

13:42.416 --> 13:44.100
Meanwhile,
the justice friends,

13:44.133 --> 13:45.333
cruising along
in the American muscle.

13:45.366 --> 13:49.466
Excuse me, major, but that looks
like a pretty powerful machine.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.250
Right you are,
my friend.

13:51.283 --> 13:52.366
We're talking
a fully blown

13:52.400 --> 13:56.200
hemispherically
fuel-injected
700 cubic inch,

13:56.233 --> 13:58.083
nitro-methane
powered beast.

13:58.116 --> 14:00.300
Posi-rear
with slick fifties.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.033
And some pretty neat
stickers, too.

14:03.066 --> 14:04.450
So, bro, if
it's
so powerful,

14:04.483 --> 14:07.350
why are we
in last place?

14:07.383 --> 14:08.483
Patience, my friend,

14:09.016 --> 14:12.400
for the red, white, and blue
will never come in...2.

14:12.433 --> 14:15.133
Announcer: Speaking of 2,
how's that lovely couple

14:15.166 --> 14:17.100
in the family sedan
holding up?

14:17.133 --> 14:18.233
Honey, we better
speed up.

14:18.266 --> 14:21.300
It looks like
the other racers
are gaining on us.

14:21.333 --> 14:23.100
Don't you
worry, dear.

14:23.133 --> 14:24.366
They won't even
get close,

14:24.400 --> 14:27.100
thanks to my special
modifications,

14:27.133 --> 14:28.266
like overinflated
tires

14:28.300 --> 14:32.200
and turbo-Max
l.E.D.-Lit custom
windshield wipers.

14:32.233 --> 14:34.133
What do they
do, dear?

14:34.166 --> 14:35.033
Nothing.

14:35.066 --> 14:36.416
But they sure
look cool.

14:36.450 --> 14:38.016
And most important,

14:38.050 --> 14:41.200
I removed
all extra weight
from the vehicle,

14:41.233 --> 14:42.116
including...

14:42.150 --> 14:45.000
[Engine sputters
and stops]

14:45.033 --> 14:47.400
The gas tank?

14:47.433 --> 14:50.050
Right.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.433
Oh, right on, baby.

14:51.466 --> 14:54.016
Now we're, like,
number one.

14:54.050 --> 14:56.150
Wind bear, isn't this
whole competition thing

14:56.183 --> 14:58.116
representative
of the lame ideas

14:58.150 --> 15:00.033
embraced by a society
which chooses

15:00.066 --> 15:01.416
neither to acknowledge
or support

15:01.450 --> 15:03.433
true individuality
in its futile quest

15:03.466 --> 15:05.166
for political
uniformity?

15:05.200 --> 15:08.150
Oh, no, man.
Our groovy
little excursion

15:08.183 --> 15:10.000
is merely symbolic
of our duty

15:10.033 --> 15:13.100
as citizens
of the united
freaks of america

15:13.133 --> 15:15.283
to use whatever
available resources

15:15.316 --> 15:19.466
that are, um...
Available...

15:20.000 --> 15:22.316
To aid in the ability
to elude the clutches

15:22.350 --> 15:25.266
of the ever-oppressive
auto-cannibalistic

15:25.300 --> 15:26.366
capitalistic regime,

15:26.400 --> 15:28.350
which functions
are the mere pawn

15:28.383 --> 15:30.333
of its equally
oppressive government

15:30.366 --> 15:33.450
so that we, um...
You know, that we...

15:33.483 --> 15:37.366
Oh, now I forgot
what I was saying, man.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.033
Anyway...

15:39.066 --> 15:40.366
Do you dig?

15:40.400 --> 15:42.033
Hmm...no.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.366
Check this out, man.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.000
This state-of-the-art
nitro booster,

15:46.033 --> 15:48.033
when activated,
will totally give us,

15:48.066 --> 15:50.266
like, the boost
we need to achieve

15:50.300 --> 15:53.483
our ultimate
journey, man.

15:56.416 --> 15:59.266
Get your motor
runnin'.

16:00.300 --> 16:03.000
Beginning pursuit.

16:03.383 --> 16:04.233
[Siren]

16:04.266 --> 16:06.466
Aw, man.
It's the heat.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.066
Bummer.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.316
Don't stress, Bess.
I got it all
dialed in.

16:11.350 --> 16:13.400
[Siren]

16:17.050 --> 16:19.100
I'll do the talking.

16:19.133 --> 16:23.216
So...where's
Mr. Wavy-gravy

16:23.250 --> 16:25.016
off to
in such a hurry?

16:25.050 --> 16:27.350
Well, you see, like,
we're having this race, dig?

16:27.383 --> 16:29.416
Which I believe
is part of our right

16:29.450 --> 16:31.300
to life, Liberty,
and the...

16:31.333 --> 16:37.000
Purs...uh, the pursu...
The presa...

16:37.033 --> 16:39.150
Um, whatever. You dig?

16:39.183 --> 16:41.166
Sir, ma'am, I need
to ask all y'all

16:41.200 --> 16:43.150
to step out
of the vehicle.

16:43.183 --> 16:44.200
Way to go.

16:44.233 --> 16:45.433
Hey, it worked
at Berkeley.

16:45.466 --> 16:49.133
This isn't Berkeley.
It's Burbank.

16:49.166 --> 16:52.016
Announcer: Meanwhile,
the race is getting close,

16:52.050 --> 16:54.266
as our wacky team
passes the halfway Mark.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.366
Number one is still showing
a strong lead,

16:56.400 --> 16:58.433
followed by number 6
in second place,

16:58.466 --> 17:00.133
with number 5
close behind.

17:00.166 --> 17:01.366
In a steady fourth,
number 2.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.033
Next, number 7,
and what's this?

17:03.066 --> 17:06.133
Hey, it looks like mom and dad
are back in the race.

17:06.166 --> 17:09.000
And it looks like
the race is narrowing...

17:09.033 --> 17:09.433
Literally.

17:09.466 --> 17:12.433
Mandark:
Rats! I can't pass.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.116
Wait. I know.

17:14.150 --> 17:16.383
Announcer: Well, it looks
like the dark man special

17:16.416 --> 17:18.433
has a leg up
on the competition,

17:18.466 --> 17:23.066
landing in first place,
spelling trouble for the others.

17:23.100 --> 17:25.266
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

17:25.300 --> 17:26.333
Speaking of trouble,

17:26.366 --> 17:29.283
let's check up
on the merry prankster.

17:30.266 --> 17:34.200
Policeman: So,
what do we have here?

17:34.233 --> 17:38.016
Oh, dude, that's
my way-out nitro booster.

17:38.050 --> 17:39.350
But just, like,
make sure

17:39.383 --> 17:42.116
you don't, like,
turn the valve on.

17:43.050 --> 17:45.333
Policeman:
Stop this crazy thing!

17:45.366 --> 17:47.033
Bummer.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.133
What do we do now?

17:49.166 --> 17:51.250
Wow. Far out, man.

17:51.283 --> 17:54.316
I have an idea.

17:54.450 --> 17:57.050
Announcer: Meanwhile,
mandark is still in the lead

17:57.083 --> 18:00.083
as we approach
the tippenagogo-agogo tunnel.

18:00.116 --> 18:02.083
Mandark: This is
the perfect spot

18:02.116 --> 18:06.466
to try out
my...Top-secret plan.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.166
Krunk afraid
of the dark.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.250
Oh, don't worry,
big fella.

18:11.283 --> 18:16.283
Lady Liberty's
torch will guide
us through.

18:16.316 --> 18:18.450
And now...

18:18.483 --> 18:22.083
That was weird.

18:22.116 --> 18:25.000
What is that
mandark up to?

18:27.066 --> 18:29.150
Hmm...

18:30.383 --> 18:35.116
Uh, like, you can
open your eyes now.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.350
Announcer: All of our racers
have exited the tunnel,

18:38.383 --> 18:41.116
and according to radar,
are stopped.

18:41.150 --> 18:44.383
No, our live camera shows them
moving along at a crisp pace.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.450
Well, I'll be.

18:45.483 --> 18:49.016
Koosie,
do you notice
anything strange?

18:49.050 --> 18:50.283
Like what, Dee Dee?

18:50.316 --> 18:51.433
It feels
like we've been

18:51.466 --> 18:54.133
on this same stretch
of road forever.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.016
Look! There
it is again.

18:56.050 --> 18:57.250
There's what, Dee Dee?

18:57.283 --> 18:59.000
That pile
of rocks.

18:59.033 --> 19:00.216
We keep
passing it.

19:00.250 --> 19:02.233
There it is
again...

19:02.266 --> 19:03.316
And again.

19:03.350 --> 19:06.333
Now, now, Dee Dee.
That's called a repeat pan,

19:06.366 --> 19:09.166
first implemented
by William Hannah

19:09.200 --> 19:11.116
and Joseph barbera
in 1947

19:11.150 --> 19:14.033
to streamline
production costs.

19:14.066 --> 19:15.133
Well, I don't
like it.

19:15.166 --> 19:16.316
Announcer: And neither
does Dexter.

19:16.350 --> 19:18.183
Computer: Dexter,
I am detecting

19:18.216 --> 19:20.016
a negative-ion
force field

19:20.050 --> 19:21.183
in the direct
vicinity.

19:21.216 --> 19:23.466
Hmm...i got
a funny feeling
about this.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.116
Computer, give me
a location scan
since 3 minutes ago.

19:32.233 --> 19:33.450
I do not believe it!

19:33.483 --> 19:37.400
Computer, give me
ultraviolet scanner.

19:38.283 --> 19:39.400
Ha ha! I knew it.

19:39.433 --> 19:42.216
It appears as though
we have been driving
for miles,

19:42.250 --> 19:45.100
but in actuality,
we are still
inside the tunnel.

19:45.133 --> 19:48.266
Mandark trapped us
in a virtual-reality
force loop.

19:48.300 --> 19:52.266
Computer, terminate
force loop.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.400
Yeah! We did it!

19:58.433 --> 20:00.016
Announcer:
Now all they have to do

20:00.050 --> 20:01.316
is catch up
to that shifty old mandark,

20:01.350 --> 20:03.016
who's got
an impressive lead.

20:03.050 --> 20:06.166
But wait. It looks
like the other wacky racers

20:06.200 --> 20:08.150
are making
a strong comeback

20:08.183 --> 20:10.266
as we approach
the final quarter.

20:10.300 --> 20:12.433
Number 2, the dark man,
still in the lead,

20:12.466 --> 20:14.033
with the lab rat
on his tail.

20:14.066 --> 20:16.166
Number 5, Dee Dee and koosie,
in a close third,

20:16.200 --> 20:17.366
followed by
the banana barge,

20:17.400 --> 20:20.333
and coming up last,
the glory lorry.

20:20.366 --> 20:22.033
Major glory:
Washington's wig!

20:22.066 --> 20:24.233
It looks like
we have to pull over.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.250
[Siren]

20:28.433 --> 20:32.316
Ha ha ha. Leave it
to the conformists

20:32.350 --> 20:35.100
to obey the law.

20:35.133 --> 20:36.233
Hey, that's not
the heat.

20:36.266 --> 20:37.400
That's
the competition.

20:37.433 --> 20:41.383
Announcer: Now the other racers
take off after mandark,

20:41.416 --> 20:46.116
except for number 7,
who seems to have stalled out.

20:46.150 --> 20:50.116
Major glory,
car go...

20:50.150 --> 20:52.183
[Sputtering]

20:53.083 --> 20:54.416
Yes, krunk, I know.

20:54.450 --> 20:57.483
But I just put
new points in it.

20:58.016 --> 20:59.383
Now what are
we gonna do?

20:59.416 --> 21:02.200
There's only
one thing we can do.

21:02.233 --> 21:03.350
Announcer:
It looks like

21:03.383 --> 21:05.433
American muscle
is back in the race.

21:05.466 --> 21:07.250
When push
comes to shove,

21:07.283 --> 21:10.116
American ingenuity always
steps up to the plate.

21:10.150 --> 21:12.283
Major glory:
You can say that again.

21:12.316 --> 21:15.083
Faster! Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster! Faster!

21:15.116 --> 21:17.333
Announcer: And as we come
to the final leg of the race,

21:17.366 --> 21:19.016
it looks like it's
gonna be a close one.

21:19.050 --> 21:22.150
They're all neck-and-neck,
vying for that lead position.

21:22.183 --> 21:24.116
Oh, boy, is this
gonna be close!

21:24.150 --> 21:27.116
We may need to have
a photo finish,

21:27.150 --> 21:29.200
and the winner is...

21:29.233 --> 21:31.016
The policeman?

21:31.050 --> 21:32.116
Let's go to the winner

21:32.150 --> 21:34.450
and see if he has
any words for us.

21:34.483 --> 21:37.100
Why, yes. Yes, I do.

21:37.133 --> 21:40.033
Get me out of here!

21:40.066 --> 21:43.200
Announcer: And so ends
another exciting episode

21:43.233 --> 21:45.316
of<i>Dexter's wacky races.</i>
