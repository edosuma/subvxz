00:38.200 --> 00:41.080
Forests at first sight

00:41.080 --> 00:44.080
may seem quiet and tranquil.

00:51.720 --> 00:55.360
But today we can explore them
in new ways...

00:58.440 --> 01:00.640
...and from a new perspective.

01:02.960 --> 01:07.560
And, in fact, they're full of
unexpected connections,

01:07.560 --> 01:09.440
relationships

01:09.440 --> 01:12.520
and even secret messages.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.800
Only now are we discovering

01:27.800 --> 01:31.080
how strange and complex

01:31.080 --> 01:33.560
forests actually are.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.000
The rainforest of Borneo.

02:00.960 --> 02:06.200
A pair of oriental pied hornbills
are renewing their partnership.

02:11.760 --> 02:13.600
They mate for life.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.480
And this year's nesting season
is just starting.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.760
Before they face
the challenges ahead,

02:36.760 --> 02:38.840
they reaffirm their bond.

02:48.360 --> 02:52.080
And they do so with an
unusual ritual...

02:54.120 --> 02:58.000
...at the entrance to a bat cave
that they know well.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.200
This rather curious gift

03:34.200 --> 03:37.080
isn't normally on their menu.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.200
But it both demonstrates devotion

03:43.200 --> 03:47.800
and reassures the female that
her mate will provide for her.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.840
In the coming weeks,
she will depend on him

03:58.840 --> 04:01.640
in the most extraordinary way.

04:10.440 --> 04:14.400
Nesting is a dangerous time
for any bird.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.040
The hole in this tree trunk

04:21.040 --> 04:24.000
will provide vital protection.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.120
Just what she wants.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.440
Once settled inside...

04:35.440 --> 04:38.720
...the female does something
truly bizarre.

04:41.120 --> 04:44.960
She pulls out her flight feathers.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.240
She is not going to need them

04:50.240 --> 04:55.440
because she will be staying
in here for quite some time.

05:00.080 --> 05:03.000
It's not only a little cramped,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.360
it also lacks basic amenities.

05:14.760 --> 05:18.720
Now her partner brings her
a beakful of mud.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.880
And she begins to seal herself in.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.800
She has turned the tree hole

05:42.800 --> 05:46.800
into a predator-proof fortress.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.880
But it's also...

06:05.880 --> 06:08.160
...a prison.

06:34.760 --> 06:38.160
Her partner, however,
is a regular visitor.

06:42.680 --> 06:47.120
For the next two months,
he will deliver all her food

06:47.120 --> 06:50.000
directly to her door.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.840
But she can be fussy.

07:15.720 --> 07:19.400
He's going to have his work cut out.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.800
Delicious.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.840
It may seem that he has been
doing all the work...

08:30.840 --> 08:34.120
...But she, too,
has been fully occupied.

08:35.720 --> 08:39.240
The food he has brought
has enabled her to produce

08:39.240 --> 08:41.840
two precious eggs.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.680
She will keep them safe
for another six weeks

08:50.680 --> 08:53.920
until the young have grown
and fledged.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.680
And then, both she and they

08:59.680 --> 09:02.520
will break out of their confinement.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.840
But until then...

09:19.840 --> 09:25.480
...this devoted couple are
going to be very busy indeed.

09:41.960 --> 09:45.280
The warmth and the moisture
of rainforests

09:45.280 --> 09:47.960
enables their inhabitants
to flourish

09:47.960 --> 09:50.880
in both numbers and variety.

09:55.560 --> 10:00.760
And here, in the Amazon,
live many strange species.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.400
This is a treehopper.

10:12.960 --> 10:16.480
One of hundreds of different types
in this forest.

10:25.360 --> 10:29.400
They not only have
a bizarre appearance...

10:29.400 --> 10:31.840
...but they also communicate...

10:33.680 --> 10:36.000
...in a remarkable way.

10:43.080 --> 10:46.040
Vibrating their bodies,
they send signals

10:46.040 --> 10:48.360
through the forest plants
they live on.

11:00.760 --> 11:05.360
Most of these messages we can only
hear by using special microphones.

11:12.520 --> 11:16.960
Each treehopper species has
its own repertoire.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.440
And every sound...

11:33.280 --> 11:36.000
...has its own particular meaning.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.760
Whether it is to attract a mate...

11:45.800 --> 11:48.720
...share information about food...

11:53.400 --> 11:57.120
...or warn each other about the
arrival of predators.

12:12.360 --> 12:16.440
This treehopper mother
communicates with her young,

12:16.440 --> 12:19.240
encouraging them to stay together

12:19.240 --> 12:21.840
so that she can protect them.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.520
For there are plenty here
waiting to eat young treehoppers.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.520
Ants...

12:40.520 --> 12:41.880
...on the hunt.

12:58.400 --> 13:02.720
Treehoppers know how to
defend themselves.

13:06.280 --> 13:10.400
But not all threats are
so easily dealt with.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.600
An assassin bug.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.440
Armed with piercing mouthparts

13:26.440 --> 13:29.160
and sticky front legs...

13:35.320 --> 13:41.080
...capable of literally sucking
the life out of her entire brood.

13:51.760 --> 13:55.480
She can try to block
the assassin's path.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.120
But she can't guard them all.

14:00.880 --> 14:05.720
She needs help from friends
in high places.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.560
Bees.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.480
They're very aggressive.

14:48.320 --> 14:51.560
This is more than the assassin bug
bargained for.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.880
Mission accomplished.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.800
Her brood are safe.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.680
The bees don't protect
the treehoppers for free.

15:07.280 --> 15:11.960
A little tickle on
a treehopper's back...

15:11.960 --> 15:15.800
...and they exude a sugary liquid.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.080
Honeydew.

15:24.320 --> 15:27.920
A sweet reward for protecting them.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.760
It's just one of the countless ways

15:42.760 --> 15:46.760
in which forest species
work together.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.800
In the forests of India,

16:07.800 --> 16:12.160
you can hear a unique and truly
extraordinary sound.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.400
These are dholes...

16:26.320 --> 16:30.440
...wild dogs that whistle.

16:34.560 --> 16:39.120
Like treehoppers, they, too,
communicate in secret -

16:39.120 --> 16:42.120
but for a different reason.

16:49.320 --> 16:54.000
Hunting in a dense teak forest
is difficult...

16:55.600 --> 17:00.520
...especially so if your prey is
three times your own size.

17:05.440 --> 17:09.360
The only way for dholes to succeed

17:09.360 --> 17:11.640
is to work as a team.

17:18.800 --> 17:23.040
This family has four growing pups.

17:46.480 --> 17:51.560
A chital deer could feed
the entire pack.

17:59.080 --> 18:02.000
The pack must get close...

18:05.760 --> 18:08.320
...without being detected.

18:23.680 --> 18:26.680
But with eyes and ears everywhere...

18:29.120 --> 18:33.520
...the deer are soon aware
of the dogs' presence.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.360
The pack can't afford to give up.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.920
They may have better luck here.

18:56.960 --> 19:01.760
The vegetation is dense
and provides better cover.

19:03.800 --> 19:08.360
But the dholes could easily
lose track of one another.

19:08.360 --> 19:11.720
So they use their unique whistles.

19:28.280 --> 19:32.400
Only dholes can understand

19:32.400 --> 19:35.440
these quiet, unobtrusive calls.

19:53.200 --> 19:58.440
Now they take up their
hunting positions...

20:03.360 --> 20:06.360
...even though they can't
see each other.

20:27.880 --> 20:30.120
With the deer surrounded...

20:31.560 --> 20:34.720
...the dholes wait for the signal
to attack.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.520
Some of the dholes split the herd...

21:02.040 --> 21:06.120
...and drive a stag towards
others waiting in ambush.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.920
DHOLES SNARL

21:39.320 --> 21:42.360
The dholes' ability to
communicate so quietly

21:42.360 --> 21:44.880
enables them to stay connected,

21:44.880 --> 21:49.040
and so hunt successfully in
the tangle of their jungle.

22:08.280 --> 22:13.040
The mountainous forests
of central China.

22:16.040 --> 22:21.600
Until recently, these were among
the least known of forests.

22:23.720 --> 22:26.400
They're full of swirling mists,

22:26.400 --> 22:29.120
and few outsiders had any idea

22:29.120 --> 22:31.400
of what they might contain.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.080
Living in such dense vegetation,

22:40.080 --> 22:43.840
it's difficult to make
yourself seen...

22:43.840 --> 22:46.320
...even when you want to be.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.960
And that's a problem for this
male Temminck's tragopan.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.840
He has lived most of his life alone.

22:59.960 --> 23:03.520
And this is his first mating season.

23:06.840 --> 23:12.320
He needs to make himself conspicuous
in the gloom of the forest floor,

23:12.320 --> 23:15.920
and he's found a clearing
where he might do so.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.680
A female.

23:32.080 --> 23:35.240
She, too, is looking for a mate.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.680
This could be his moment.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.640
Oh, dear.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.320
Stage fright.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.120
And who is this?

24:22.280 --> 24:25.240
A male golden pheasant.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.960
He, too, has come to
this clearing...

24:31.640 --> 24:34.120
...to attract a female.

24:39.160 --> 24:43.560
And he seems a little
more confident.

25:10.720 --> 25:14.040
So that is how it's done.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.600
The tragopan might still
have a chance.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.680
Here is a new female.

25:26.880 --> 25:29.080
But is she interested?

25:36.400 --> 25:38.760
It's time to be bold.

25:49.280 --> 25:52.120
He pumps up a pair of horns

25:52.120 --> 25:54.480
and a multicoloured bib.

25:57.840 --> 26:00.360
It's a sight to be wondered at.

26:05.920 --> 26:09.640
And it has never before been
filmed in the wild.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.400
Not today.

26:50.880 --> 26:53.280
How deflating.

27:09.200 --> 27:14.240
The temperate rainforests
of western Canada.

27:17.960 --> 27:22.440
Some of the trees here
are 1,000 years old.

27:40.640 --> 27:45.360
It's autumn, and the beginning
of a spectacle that each year

27:45.360 --> 27:49.880
transforms this forest
and all that lives in it.

27:58.280 --> 28:02.680
After years at sea,
thousands of Pacific salmon

28:02.680 --> 28:06.480
are returning to these streams
to breed.

28:13.160 --> 28:17.720
And they attract the forest's
rarest resident.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.200
A spirit bear.

28:41.640 --> 28:45.120
A white variant of the black bear.

28:55.520 --> 28:59.040
Fewer than 150 exist,

28:59.040 --> 29:01.280
and they're found only here.

29:10.960 --> 29:16.720
This female has fished for salmon
here for 20 years.

29:43.960 --> 29:46.080
Get your timing right...

29:49.160 --> 29:52.080
...and there can be great rewards.

29:59.160 --> 30:02.800
In her youth, she was, in fact,
even more successful

30:02.800 --> 30:05.600
than the black bears.

30:12.560 --> 30:16.280
Perhaps her pale coat makes it
difficult for the fish to see her

30:16.280 --> 30:18.720
against the bright sky,

30:18.720 --> 30:21.320
and that could give her
an advantage.

30:27.880 --> 30:31.040
But now she is old,

30:31.040 --> 30:34.720
and this year she's finding it hard.

31:01.600 --> 31:06.560
Her fishing skills, however,
haven't totally deserted her.

31:10.720 --> 31:14.040
This annual feast helps
her to fatten,

31:14.040 --> 31:16.560
ready for the winter ahead.

31:21.760 --> 31:25.880
But it also helps the patch of
forest where she lives.

31:28.240 --> 31:33.240
This female has an unusual
relationship with the forest.

31:37.280 --> 31:41.880
Every fish carcass
she leaves behind decays,

31:41.880 --> 31:46.080
releasing nutrients that soak
into the soil.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.480
And there...

31:55.240 --> 31:59.760
...they are collected by
a network of fungi.

32:14.560 --> 32:19.080
The threads attach themselves
to the trees' roots.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.800
And nutrients from the fish,
collected by the fungi,

32:25.800 --> 32:29.160
are then passed on to the trees.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.760
As a consequence,
the forest around the river

32:33.760 --> 32:37.200
grows three times faster
than elsewhere.

32:46.800 --> 32:52.160
And some trees here become
as tall as any in the world...

33:00.160 --> 33:05.600
...and provide spirit bears
with a healthy forest home.

33:21.880 --> 33:28.320
We now know that such relationships
exist in forests all over the world.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.840
At the heart of these
many connections

33:35.840 --> 33:39.120
stand giant trees, like this one.

33:40.760 --> 33:43.000
A kapok.

33:45.400 --> 33:50.200
It started life as a seed
some 200 years ago.

33:53.360 --> 33:58.040
Now it towers 60 metres above
the forest floor...

33:59.840 --> 34:04.720
...and transports 1,000 litres
of nutrient-filled water

34:04.720 --> 34:10.600
from its roots up to its canopy
every day.

34:16.640 --> 34:21.080
So this giant gives life to others.

34:29.960 --> 34:33.200
A whole community of animals
and plants

34:33.200 --> 34:37.080
depends on the wellbeing
of this one tree.

35:22.520 --> 35:26.440
A single cut made in
just a few moments

35:26.440 --> 35:31.040
has broken thousands of
long-established connections.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.600
Across the world's forests,

35:42.600 --> 35:47.440
this story is being repeated endlessly.

36:00.720 --> 36:03.880
15 billion trees

36:03.880 --> 36:07.320
are cut down every year.

36:17.840 --> 36:21.520
Every one of these trees is,
in itself,

36:21.520 --> 36:24.360
an intricate ecosystem.

36:36.600 --> 36:40.600
But here in Brazil,
they're being replaced

36:40.600 --> 36:45.000
by plantations of a single
species of tree.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.520
Originally from Australia...

36:58.200 --> 37:01.520
...these eucalypts are unable
to build relationships

37:01.520 --> 37:05.080
with most of the native plants
and animals.

37:12.600 --> 37:16.520
And, worse, these newcomers
grow so rapidly

37:16.520 --> 37:19.360
they extract nutrients from the soil

37:19.360 --> 37:22.520
faster than they can be replaced.

37:31.080 --> 37:34.960
And what was once a rich
and complex world...

37:37.240 --> 37:42.320
...becomes little more than
a green desert.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.960
And at just five years of age...

38:20.160 --> 38:22.360
...their lives are ended.

38:25.120 --> 38:29.000
They're felled and taken away.

38:39.440 --> 38:45.080
Their wood is then pulped
to make paper.

38:56.200 --> 39:00.320
And all that remains of
the rich rainforest

39:00.320 --> 39:03.720
are a few tiny patches.

39:12.200 --> 39:17.040
Patches so small that few of
the original inhabitants

39:17.040 --> 39:20.440
are able to survive in them.

39:27.440 --> 39:30.680
Uganda, East Africa.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.960
This small group of chimpanzees

39:44.960 --> 39:48.280
have a detailed knowledge
of the forest territory

39:48.280 --> 39:52.640
that they inherited from
previous generations.

40:02.520 --> 40:06.120
They know the best places
to shelter,

40:06.120 --> 40:08.000
to raise their young...

40:11.360 --> 40:13.080
...and to feed.

40:32.400 --> 40:35.520
This fruiting tree

40:35.520 --> 40:40.640
cannot by itself sustain
the chimps for long.

40:58.160 --> 41:02.880
The alpha male signals
that it's time to move on.

41:08.560 --> 41:12.320
Where he goes, others will follow.

41:30.400 --> 41:34.400
He leads them not to
another fruiting tree...

41:36.360 --> 41:39.720
...but into a new world.

41:59.200 --> 42:02.760
This road, only recently built,

42:02.760 --> 42:05.880
has cut through their territory.

42:14.920 --> 42:18.280
The alpha male is cautious.

42:26.200 --> 42:30.320
His own mother was killed
on this road.

42:52.400 --> 42:55.200
He makes sure it's clear
before crossing

42:55.200 --> 42:58.480
with the slower members
of his family.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.920
If the group is to get
what they need...

43:24.320 --> 43:28.080
...they will have to go against
their natural instincts...

43:30.440 --> 43:33.600
...and approach humans.

44:02.040 --> 44:05.840
But their new neighbours
are friendly.

44:11.600 --> 44:15.400
And they allow the chimps
to collect...

44:17.520 --> 44:19.520
...jackfruit,

44:19.520 --> 44:22.600
the largest of all tree fruits.

44:28.920 --> 44:33.920
Jackfruit grow all year round
in people's gardens.

44:46.800 --> 44:49.080
And they're more nutritious

44:49.080 --> 44:51.800
than the limited amount of wild food

44:51.800 --> 44:56.520
the chimps can now find in what
remains of their forest.

45:07.960 --> 45:10.520
But this is a new world...

45:11.840 --> 45:14.640
...and a new relationship.

45:19.280 --> 45:23.160
New boundaries need to be established.

45:26.080 --> 45:28.840
Some of the chimps start
to help themselves

45:28.840 --> 45:31.000
to people's crops.

46:04.640 --> 46:07.200
They have outstayed their welcome,

46:07.200 --> 46:11.240
and the alpha male decides
that it's time to leave.

46:31.520 --> 46:35.920
The chimps make this dangerous
journey every day.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.600
But these highly
intelligent animals,

46:56.600 --> 46:59.120
our closest living relatives,

46:59.120 --> 47:01.680
have managed, just about,

47:01.680 --> 47:04.120
to carve out a place
for themselves

47:04.120 --> 47:06.960
in this changing world.

47:12.040 --> 47:14.520
Animals have maintained

47:14.520 --> 47:17.720
a long-established relationship
with forests.

47:22.040 --> 47:26.240
But as we continue to break
our connections with them,

47:26.240 --> 47:29.000
the question is,

47:29.000 --> 47:31.480
for how much longer will
they survive?

47:33.560 --> 47:38.600
Surely, the time has come
to rebuild them.

48:01.480 --> 48:03.600
Over many years,

48:03.600 --> 48:06.760
I've been lucky enough to watch
chimps in their natural home,

48:06.760 --> 48:10.160
such as here in the thick forests
of West Africa.

48:11.480 --> 48:13.800
Chimpanzees.

48:13.800 --> 48:16.640
A peaceful scene of jungle harmony.

48:18.200 --> 48:20.720
The experienced male...

48:20.720 --> 48:23.120
...is sitting right there.

48:23.120 --> 48:26.320
But the lives of
many chimpanzees

48:26.320 --> 48:28.800
are now changing dramatically.

48:44.160 --> 48:47.960
Here, in Uganda,
over the last decade,

48:47.960 --> 48:52.280
they have lost over 80%
of their forest home.

48:58.840 --> 49:02.600
They don't live in a protected area.

49:04.640 --> 49:08.680
To survive here,
they have to live alongside

49:08.680 --> 49:13.040
the 200 or so human families
who farm here.

49:14.760 --> 49:17.520
The chimps always come
from the forest.

49:18.720 --> 49:21.120
They come to eat jackfruit
from my land.

49:22.760 --> 49:25.560
They know us by our faces,

49:25.560 --> 49:28.880
as we know them by their faces,
as well.

49:30.120 --> 49:33.520
To tell the story of this
remarkable chimp group,

49:33.520 --> 49:37.760
the Planet Earth team are working
with these residents.

49:43.360 --> 49:44.960
Who was that, Tom?

49:44.960 --> 49:46.920
This one was Araali.

49:48.800 --> 49:53.880
Tom is part of the Bulindi
Chimpanzee and Community Project.

49:55.760 --> 50:00.440
He's been studying the chimps every
day for the last 15 years...

50:01.680 --> 50:04.920
...and has seen the change
first-hand.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.040
Very many things have changed.

50:08.040 --> 50:11.800
When chimpanzees were seeing people,
they would run.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.800
Run very quickly and go.

50:13.800 --> 50:16.400
But now they just stand.

50:16.400 --> 50:18.480
Because everywhere they go,

50:18.480 --> 50:20.640
they find a person.

50:23.160 --> 50:27.480
Chimps are normally tricky
to film in the wild.

50:27.480 --> 50:31.080
But in this human world,
the crew are surprised

50:31.080 --> 50:33.960
by how easy it is to approach them.

50:36.960 --> 50:39.480
Another one
coming up the path.

50:42.840 --> 50:44.840
But back in the forest,

50:44.840 --> 50:47.200
it's a different story.

50:50.240 --> 50:54.200
Here, the chimps seem wary
of the newcomers.

51:03.200 --> 51:05.040
There's a ditch there.

51:12.720 --> 51:15.160
All the crew get to see...

51:17.800 --> 51:20.000
...is a lot of bottoms.

51:21.720 --> 51:26.560
This afternoon, the chimps have been
taking us on a wild-goose chase.

51:26.560 --> 51:29.480
They've crossed the river
and then they've crossed back,

51:29.480 --> 51:31.880
gone past us
while we're in the woods,

51:31.880 --> 51:34.240
and then now
they've disappeared again.

51:35.840 --> 51:39.000
When we don't have chimps...

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
...we film goats!

51:48.840 --> 51:51.560
Here, in the chimps' forest home,

51:51.560 --> 51:54.960
it's going to take time
to earn the group's trust...

51:58.080 --> 51:59.960
I think they found Moses.

52:01.120 --> 52:03.040
...and get to know one another.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.960
This is Jack.

52:06.240 --> 52:10.120
After two weeks, things are
improving on the ground.

52:11.840 --> 52:16.400
But what will the chimps think
of the crew up in the trees?

52:20.120 --> 52:23.840
I can see a bunch of
chimp faces looking up at me.

52:23.840 --> 52:25.600
This is a new experience
for them.

52:25.600 --> 52:28.760
I doubt they've ever seen a human
in a tree before.

52:28.760 --> 52:31.920
So, hopefully, they accept me.

52:56.280 --> 52:58.640
After hours of waiting...

52:59.800 --> 53:01.600
...success!

53:05.120 --> 53:07.680
All the chimps that were
on the ground looking up at me

53:07.680 --> 53:09.600
are now happily in the tree,

53:09.600 --> 53:12.640
which is a really good sign
that they've accepted me.

53:14.400 --> 53:17.320
It's the first time that we've been
able to see at their level

53:17.320 --> 53:19.200
while they're feeding.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.560
For the crew,
it has taken a long time

53:42.560 --> 53:44.720
to gain the chimps' acceptance.

53:46.600 --> 53:49.720
But, in fact, the chimps here
have shown that they can

53:49.720 --> 53:52.480
respond quickly to the presence
of people.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.720
Chimpanzees are highly intelligent.

53:58.720 --> 54:01.240
If you cut down the forest,

54:01.240 --> 54:04.240
well, chimps will start
eating human crops.

54:04.240 --> 54:09.080
If you divide their range up
with roads and, you know...

54:09.080 --> 54:12.680
Well, chimps will end up just
learning to cross the roads.

54:15.040 --> 54:18.880
The animals can adapt to an
increasingly human environment.

54:18.880 --> 54:23.600
The question is, can people
accommodate an animal like a chimp?

54:34.000 --> 54:36.520
Chimpanzees can be dangerous.

54:39.000 --> 54:43.280
Living alongside them is
a mixed experience.

54:58.280 --> 55:02.560
The local community and the project
have been working together

55:02.560 --> 55:06.240
to try to decrease the impact
of these problems.

55:11.160 --> 55:13.840
Over the last eight years,

55:13.840 --> 55:16.000
Lilian and her family

55:16.000 --> 55:18.760
have planted native seedlings
on her land

55:18.760 --> 55:21.320
and left her patch of forest
to regrow.

55:22.480 --> 55:25.920
If we cut it, they come and
sleep in our houses,

55:25.920 --> 55:28.680
so we should leave that place
for them.

55:31.280 --> 55:34.760
If you leave them and
you don't disturb them,

55:34.760 --> 55:37.400
they are peaceful animals.

55:41.800 --> 55:45.080
With other residents following suit,

55:45.080 --> 55:50.000
more of the forest is showing
positive signs of return.

55:53.680 --> 55:56.080
There is a long way to go,

55:56.080 --> 56:00.320
and the future for these chimps
remains uncertain.

56:03.600 --> 56:07.520
But where peaceful coexistence
can be built,

56:07.520 --> 56:09.680
there is hope.

56:19.040 --> 56:21.960
Next time...

56:21.960 --> 56:26.040
...animals battle the elements
in a world of extremes...

56:29.120 --> 56:31.800
...where life exists on
a knife edge...

56:34.840 --> 56:38.280
...in Earth's greatest
natural wonders.

56:44.120 --> 56:47.520
