WEBVTT

00:04.104 --> 00:06.907
HMM, SINCE YOU'RE PLAYING
WITH LEGO PIECES,

00:06.974 --> 00:09.710
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PUT
YOUR WINE IN A SIPPY CUP?

00:11.211 --> 00:14.147
I'M NOT PLAYING.
I'M BUILDING
A SCALE REPLICA

00:14.214 --> 00:16.049
OF THE CERN SUPERCOLLIDER
FOR A SCHOOL PROJECT.

00:16.116 --> 00:21.522
OH REALLY?
BECAUSE THE BOX
SAYS "DEATH STAR."

00:21.588 --> 00:24.024
I JUST GOT OFF
THE MOST FRUSTRATING CALL

00:24.091 --> 00:27.194
WITH THE PRESIDENT
OF THE CO-OP BOARD.

00:27.261 --> 00:31.131
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
FRUSTRATING TRYING TO USE
THAT GIANT CORDLESS PHONE.

00:31.198 --> 00:35.969
THIS IS A DOUBLE SHOWERHEAD
AND HE WON'T LET ME PUT IT
IN MY SHOWER.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.839
THE CO-OP WON'T LET YOU
HAVE TWO SHOWERHEADS?

00:38.906 --> 00:42.809
I ALREADY HAVE TWO.
I WANT FOUR MORE.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.179
THAT SEEMS LIKE
A WASTE OF WATER.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.047
OH, SWEETIE, IT'S A DROP
IN THE BUCKET

00:47.114 --> 00:50.317
COMPARED TO THE KOI POND
IN MY LIBRARY.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.053
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HOME
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT?

00:53.120 --> 00:55.055
WELL, WE WERE GOING
TO HANG OUT AT MICKEY'S,

00:55.122 --> 00:58.192
BUT FOR SOME REASON
THEY'RE CLOSED FOR A FEW DAYS.

00:58.258 --> 01:01.261
THEY'RE THE ONLY PLACE
THAT GIVES US FREE DRINKS--
EXCEPT FOR HERE.

01:02.095 --> 01:06.200
THOSE AREN'T FREE.
YOU WILL BE GETTING
A BILL, DEAR.

01:06.266 --> 01:08.669
- I TOLD YOU.
- I DID HEAR

01:08.735 --> 01:10.671
SOMETHING ABOUT MICKEY'S
BEING CLOSED.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.640
THEY'RE FILMING
A TV SHOW THERE.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.509
UH, WHAT SHOW?

01:15.576 --> 01:18.712
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
YOU GIRLS ALWAYS WATCH.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.515
HA, I WATCH
20 HOURS OF TV
A DAY, AUNT HONEY.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.050
I'M GOING TO NEED YOU
TO BE MORE SPECIFIC.

01:23.116 --> 01:27.154
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
WITH THE LEGGY LADY
THAT'S ALWAYS IN COURT.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.055
( SQUEALS )
"DOUX PROCESS"?

01:28.121 --> 01:30.958
STARRING GWEN DRESSEL
AS VIVIAN DOUX,

01:31.024 --> 01:34.995
THE TOUGH-AS-NAILS DETECTIVE
WHO SOLVES CRIMES WHILE RAISING
HER EIGHT ADORABLE KIDS?

01:36.096 --> 01:38.966
( GROANS )
THAT SHOW MAKES
A COMPLETE MOCKERY

01:39.032 --> 01:41.268
OF THE FORENSIC SCIENCES.

01:41.335 --> 01:44.972
BUT THE KID WITH THE LISP
HAS STOLEN MY HEART.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.039
HOW'D YOU KNOW THEY WERE
FILMING DOWN THERE?

01:46.106 --> 01:51.612
WELL, A MAN I MAY
OR MAY NOT HAVE MET
AT A TURKISH BATHHOUSE--

01:51.678 --> 01:53.614
HE'S ONE OF THE PRODUCERS.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.316
HE JUST WENT ON AND ON
ABOUT HOW GREAT THE SHOW WAS

01:56.383 --> 01:59.753
AND HOW IT'S LAUNCHED
THE CAREERS OF SO MANY
YOUNG ACTORS.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.189
WELL, YOU GIRLS HAVE
A GREAT EVENING.

02:02.256 --> 02:05.092
OH UH BUT-- HEY!

02:05.158 --> 02:08.729
YOU CAN'T JUST THROW
INFORMATION OUT LIKE THAT
AND THEN LEAVE.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.632
YOU THINK YOU CAN GET ME
A PART ON THE SHOW?

02:11.698 --> 02:13.600
WHY WOULD YOU WANT ONE?

02:13.667 --> 02:15.035
I AM AN ACTRESS.

02:15.102 --> 02:17.838
ARE YOU STILL FOOLING
AROUND WITH THAT?

02:20.107 --> 02:22.709
YOU READ LINES
WITH ME YESTERDAY.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.245
YOU MEAN WE'RE NOT REALLY
PLANNING A BANK HEIST?

02:26.113 --> 02:29.116
I'LL MAKE A CALL.

02:29.183 --> 02:32.753
JO, DID YOU HEAR THAT?
MY FIRST TV JOB.

02:32.819 --> 02:37.424
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
I AM ONE STEP CLOSER
TO MY<i>SECOND</i>TV JOB.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.561
BUT FIRST I GOTTA FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET MY SHOWERHEAD

02:40.627 --> 02:42.396
PAST THE CO-OP BOARD.

02:42.462 --> 02:45.732
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU NEED SIX OF THEM.

02:45.799 --> 02:50.037
WHY DO I NEED SIX CARS
WHEN I ONLY HAVE ONE BEHIND?

02:51.805 --> 02:53.040
I'M RICH, GIRLS.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.108
KEEP UP!

02:57.110 --> 02:59.112
<i>( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

03:17.297 --> 03:19.666
I HOPE YOU REMEMBER IT
TO FILM IT.ORGOT

03:20.734 --> 03:23.003
SORRY, BUT WE'RE CLOSED
FOR A TV SHOOT.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.672
OH, I KNOW.
I'M A GUEST STAR.

YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TRAILERS ARE, WOULD YOU?STAR

03:28.342 --> 03:31.178

OVER THERE IS THE DIRECTOR.

03:31.245 --> 03:34.314
- THANK YOU.
- GEORGIA IS ABOUT TO MEET

03:34.381 --> 03:35.048
THE DIRECTOR
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

03:35.115 --> 03:39.553
SHE HESITATES BEFORE SPEAKING.
WHAT WILL SHE SAY?

03:39.620 --> 03:42.155
IF YOU JUST "SHH,"

03:42.222 --> 03:44.124
I'LL SAY IT.

03:46.126 --> 03:49.897
HI, I'M GEORGIA CHAMBERLAIN.

03:49.963 --> 03:53.066
UH, GUEST STAR.
MY AUNT HONEY MADE THE CALL.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.035
OH RIGHT.

03:55.102 --> 03:58.105
THE, UM, BATHHOUSE FAVOR.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.943
WHOO, THAT IS NOT A NICKNAME
I WOULD LIKE TO STICK.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.045
UH, YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHERE MY TRAILER IS, WOULD YOU?

04:05.112 --> 04:09.683
TRAILER?
EXTRAS DON'T GET TRAILERS.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.119
EXTRA?
LIKE IN THE BACKGROUND?

04:12.186 --> 04:14.087
NO NO NO NO NO, SEE,

04:14.154 --> 04:16.023
THERE IS NO WAY THAT I DO NOT
HAVE A SPEAKING ROLE.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.960
YOU MUST HAVE ME CONFUSED
BATHHOUSE FAVOR.LITTLE

04:20.027 --> 04:23.030

UM, I'M SORRY.
BAKED-POTATO BAR.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.916
WHAT DID I MISS?

04:49.823 --> 04:53.260
OKAY, EXTRAS, I'M GOING
TO NEED YOU IN JUST A FEW.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.062
- THE FIRST SHOT
IS JUST ABOUT READY.
- OH NO, I GOT IT.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.031
OH, YOU MEAN YOUR SHOT.
RIGHT.

04:58.098 --> 05:02.102
WELL, IF YOU NEED
A SECOND CAMERA, I'LL--
I'LL BE WAY WAY OVER HERE.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.908
UH, EXCUSE ME,
MR. DIRECTOR.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.777
HI, I LOOKED OVER THE SCRIPT
AND I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.779
OH!
OKAY, SURE.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.048
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
I WILL JUST HALT PRODUCTION

05:15.115 --> 05:18.118
AND WE CAN SIT
AND HAVE A DRINK

05:18.185 --> 05:20.754
AND I'LL ANSWER
ALL YOUR QUESTIONS.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.191
OR I CAN MAKE THE SHOW.

05:24.258 --> 05:27.427
GO AHEAD AND DO THAT.
WE'LL GET THAT DRINK LATER.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.063
- HI.
- HI.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.032
SO WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

05:32.099 --> 05:35.102
- WHY ARE YOU HERE?
- I'M A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER.

05:35.169 --> 05:38.505
THIS PAYS ABOUT THE SAME,
BUT HERE I FEEL LIKE I'M MAKING
MORE OF A DIFFERENCE.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.610
AH, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.612
UM, DO YOU HAVE
ANY ACTING EXPERIENCE?

05:45.679 --> 05:49.116
HA, NO!
BUT PEOPLE TELL ME
I LOOK LIKE BRADLEY COOPER.

05:52.085 --> 05:55.656
( FORCED LAUGH )
OH MY GOD, IT'S AMATEUR HOUR.

05:55.722 --> 05:59.526
OKAY, ACTING 101!

05:59.593 --> 06:03.030
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
IN THE BACKGROUND DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T HAVE A CHARACTER.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.565
HOW MANY SHOWS HAVE YOU
BEEN AN EXTRA ON?

06:04.631 --> 06:05.032
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT,
SWEETHEART.

06:05.098 --> 06:09.436
WHAT MATTERS
IS THAT YOUR CHARACTER
HAS A BACKSTORY.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.971
FOR INSTANCE...

06:11.038 --> 06:13.473
( SOUTHERN ACCENT )
MY NAME IS CHARLOTTE

06:13.540 --> 06:17.177
AND I HAD A CRAZY CRAZY FIGHT
WITH MY HUSBAND,

06:17.244 --> 06:21.648
SOMETHING ABOUT A NANNY,
AND HE STORMED OUT.

06:21.715 --> 06:25.152
I'VE BEEN CALLING HIS CELL,
BUT HE'S NOT ANSWERING.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.654
SO A PART OF ME
THINKS THAT--

06:27.721 --> 06:31.859
THAT'S HIS BODY
RIGHT THERE.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.428
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE A DOCTOR.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.430
MAYBE THEY'LL
NEED ME TO OPERATE.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.565
( STAMMERS )
THE VICTIM'S ALREADY DEAD.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.734
WHAT?
AW, MAN!

06:40.801 --> 06:43.504
OH, BUT THE FRUSTRATION--
IT'S GOOD. USE IT.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.039
MY SCHOOL JUST TEXTED ME.
I'M SUPPOSED TO GO IN
TO WORK.

06:46.106 --> 06:49.276
YES, BUT THE POLICE
WON'T LET YOU CROSS THE TAPE.

06:49.343 --> 06:51.445
YOU'RE LIKE
A CAGED ANIMAL.
I LOVE IT!

06:51.512 --> 06:52.946
NO, I ACTUALLY
HAVE TO GO TEACH.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.716
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAVE IT
FOR THE SCENE, YEAH?

06:56.984 --> 06:58.018
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
GWEN IS HERE.

06:58.085 --> 07:03.757
LET'S HAVE GOOD ENERGY.
AND, PLEASE, NO EYE CONTACT
WITH HER.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.592
OH, YOU LOOK
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.027
WHAT A TALENT YOU ARE.
I'M SO PLEASED TO BE
WORKING WITH YOU.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.696
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GET RIGHT IN HERE?
- ( SIGHS )

07:09.763 --> 07:11.398
- YOU NEED ANYTHING?
GOOD? ALL RIGHT.
- NO, I'M OKAY.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.967
HERE WE GO.
AND...

07:14.034 --> 07:16.036
ACTION!

07:18.505 --> 07:21.775
- THIS BODY IS COLD.
- EXCUSE ME, I HAVE
TO GO TEACH.

- ERIC?
-<i>( OVER BULLHORN )</i>
Â <i>CUT CUT!</i>

07:26.680 --> 07:29.316
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A PSYCH WARD.

07:29.383 --> 07:31.318
AND THAT BLONDE
JUST LOOKED ME IN THE EYE!

07:31.385 --> 07:32.853
GWEN, I'M SORRY--

07:32.920 --> 07:35.422
I TOLD YOU TO CALL ME VIVIAN
WHEN I'M IN CHARACTER.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.024
YOU'RE RIGHT.
VIVIAN, I'M SORRY.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.127
I'M NOT IN CHARACTER ANYMORE.
CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE
REALLY READY.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.465
WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING?!

07:46.099 --> 07:50.170
YOU'RE BACKGROUND,
NOT THE THRILLER VIDEO!

07:51.872 --> 07:53.607
I WAS JUST GONNA
STAND HERE,

07:53.674 --> 07:56.009
BUT SHE TOLD US
WE HAD TO DO STUFF.

07:56.076 --> 07:59.012
WHA-- OH.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.716
BETWEEN US PROS,
THEY SEEMED A LITTLE LOST.

08:02.783 --> 08:05.385
WELL, BETWEEN US PROS,

08:05.452 --> 08:07.054
- YOU'RE FIRED.
- FIRED?

08:07.120 --> 08:10.090
BUT NO NO NO,
I'M A FAVOR.
REMEMBER?

08:10.157 --> 08:13.060
YOU CAN'T FIRE A FAVOR.
THAT MEANS SOMEBODY
STILL OWES SOMETHING.

08:13.126 --> 08:16.363
THEN YOU WILL JUST
HAVE TO RUN ALONG HOME

08:16.430 --> 08:19.099
AND HAVE YOUR AUNT CALL
SOMEONE ELSE FOR YOU.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.002
- I NEED YOU OFF THE SET.
- FINE!

08:22.069 --> 08:25.105
THERE ARE PLENTY OF ALLEYS
IN THIS TOWN WHERE A GIRL
CAN MAKE A LIVING.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.109
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
- I GOT YOU.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.589
I DON'T GET IT!
I WAS CLEARLY

08:42.656 --> 08:45.292
THE MOST TALENTED PERSON
THERE AND I GET TOSSED?

08:46.527 --> 08:48.529
THE DISAPPOINTMENT
IS PALPABLE.

08:50.163 --> 08:53.066
PLEASE STOP FILMING.
WHY DO YOU THINK I WANT
TO REMEMBER THIS MOMENT?

08:53.133 --> 08:55.469
IT'S NOT EVEN ON.
I JUST LIKE TALKING LIKE THIS.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.472
SOMEONE FIX ME
A SCOTCH AND SODA.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.408
AND YES, I KNOW
WE'RE OUT OF SODA.

09:01.475 --> 09:04.344
AUNT HONEY HAS
NEVER HAD SODA.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.648
I JUST HAD MR. HUMPHREY,
THE CO-OP BOARD PRESIDENT,

09:07.714 --> 09:10.984
IN MY APARTMENT TO DISCUSS
MY SHOWERHEAD NEEDS.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.819
THANK YOU, DARLING.

09:12.886 --> 09:16.056
( SIGHS )
WELL, HE TOOK ONE LOOK
AT MY KOI POND,

09:16.123 --> 09:19.059
THREW A FIT
AND MADE ME DRAIN IT.

09:19.126 --> 09:22.129
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

09:22.196 --> 09:25.199
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I HAD A FISH FRY.

09:25.265 --> 09:30.003
- BUT THOSE ARE
ENDANGERED JAPANESE--
- AW, IT TASTES LIKE GROUPER.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.339
SO HOW'S MY LITTLE TV STAR?

09:32.406 --> 09:34.341
WORST DAY EVER.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.978
THEY MADE ME AN EXTRA
AND THEN THEY FIRED ME
BASICALLY FOR NO REASON.

09:38.045 --> 09:41.014
YOU'RE A FAVOR.
YOU CAN'T FIRE A FAVOR.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.250
THAT MEANS SOMEONE
STILL OWES SOMETHING.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.653
YOU WANT ME TO CALL
THAT PRODUCER AGAIN?

09:46.720 --> 09:50.824
IT WILL BE A LITTLE AWKWARD.
WE HAD A BIT OF A FALLING OUT.

09:50.891 --> 09:54.828
- SOMETHING FELL OUT
THAT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO.
- CALM IT DOWN!

09:54.895 --> 09:57.164
I'M KIND OF CURIOUS.

09:58.799 --> 10:02.302
AUNT HONEY, WOULD YOU MIND
CALLING THE PRODUCER AGAIN?

10:02.369 --> 10:05.939
OH, WHY WOULD I MIND?
I HOOK YOU UP ALL THE TIME.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.775
OH, IS THIS ONE
OF MY SHOWERHEADS?

10:10.611 --> 10:12.813
YOU DO HOOK ME UP--
A LOT.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.983
WHEN DID I BECOME THE GIRL
WHO HAS THINGS HANDED TO HER?

10:16.049 --> 10:18.352
( LAUGHS )

10:18.418 --> 10:21.455
I THOUGHT SHE WAS KIDDING.
OH, YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THAT GIRL.

10:22.890 --> 10:25.659
I KNOW THAT MY FAMILY
SPOILS ME A LITTLE.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.095
A LITTLE?
LOOK WHERE WE LIVE.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.932
- YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT?
- OH NO.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.735
I LOVE IT HERE.
I LOVE IT.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.503
OH MY GOD, I GET IT NOW.

10:36.570 --> 10:39.006
THAT DIRECTOR DIDN'T
SEE ME AS A REAL ACTRESS.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.941
HE ONLY SAW ME
AS A BATHHOUSE FAVOR.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.378
HE DIDN'T THINK
THAT I EARNED MY SPOT.
THAT'S WHY HE FIRED ME.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.381
SO WHERE WE AT?
CALL, NO CALL?

10:47.447 --> 10:49.516
NO CALL.
SEE, I'M GOING TO GO BACK.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.018
I'M GOING TO TALK
TO THE DIRECTOR.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.986
I'M GOING TO ASK
FOR ANOTHER CHANCE.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.856
I'M GOING TO DO
EXACTLY AS HE SAYS
TO EARN HIS RESPECT.

10:55.923 --> 10:59.026
JO, WHY WEREN'T YOU FILMING?
THAT WAS AN AMAZING SPEECH.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.803
GEORGIA IS ABOUT
TO APPROACH THE DIRECTOR.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.606
TENSION FILLS THE AIR.

11:12.673 --> 11:16.043
- HE RECOGNIZES HER.
- HI, DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

11:17.611 --> 11:19.179
NO.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.481
SCRATCH THAT.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.750
HE HAS NO IDEA WHO SHE IS.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.420
YOU FIRED ME
A LITTLE EARLIER.

11:26.486 --> 11:29.189
AND I HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT,
BUT I SEE WHY YOU DID IT.

11:29.256 --> 11:32.826
SO NO HARD FEELINGS.
AND I'M BACK, READY TO WORK--

11:32.893 --> 11:35.762
JUST AN ACTRESS TRYING
TO GET HER FOOT IN THE DOOR.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.965
- DON'T MAKE ME CALL SECURITY.
- NO NO NO.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.234
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I HAD AN "AHA" MOMENT.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.136
IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY EXCITING.
I'M CHANGING MY WHOLE
LIFE AROUND.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.440
- APPARENTLY I HAD THIS HABIT--
- IT WAS MORE OF A PATTERN.

11:46.507 --> 11:50.944
- SECURITY!
- HEY, DO YOU THINK HE WANTS ME
TO PLAY A SECURITY GUARD?

11:53.614 --> 11:57.184
SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT
THIS RATHER LARGE GENTLEMAN
ALREADY HAS THE PART.

12:04.491 --> 12:08.195
HA HA, SECURITY CAN'T GET RID
OF ME IF I AM SECURITY.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.500
AW, MAN!
I'M MISSING A "U."

12:13.567 --> 12:17.004
I'M THE STAR.
YOU'D THINK I'D GET
MY OWN TRAILER.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.273
OH MY GOD.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.042
- I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
- YOU'RE GWEN DRESSEL.

12:22.109 --> 12:25.112
AND YOU'RE THAT WEIRD EXTRA
THAT GOT KICKED OFF THE SET.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.247
IF YOU'RE STALKING ME,
I'VE GOT PEPPER SPRAY.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.682
NO NO NO!

12:28.749 --> 12:31.118
NO NO,
I'M NOT STALKING YOU.

12:31.185 --> 12:32.986
I JUST WANT TO BE
EXACTLY LIKE YOU.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.988
- WHAT?
- OKAY, THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.024
THAT CAME OUT WRONG.
I, UM...

12:37.090 --> 12:40.127
LISTEN,
I AM A HUGE FAN.
ALL RIGHT?

12:40.194 --> 12:42.462
AND AT 13, MY MOM
TOOK ME TO NEW YORK

12:42.529 --> 12:44.798
AND I SAW YOU ON BROADWAY
IN "PHANTOM"

12:44.865 --> 12:46.800
AND YOU WERE AMAZING.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.869
AND YOU MADE ME WANT
TO BE AN ACTRESS.

12:48.936 --> 12:52.339
THANKS.
I'M STARTING TO LIKE YOU.

12:53.507 --> 12:55.108
SORRY ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED OUT THERE.

12:55.175 --> 12:58.445
OH YEAH, TODAY WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE MY BREAKOUT DAY,

12:58.512 --> 13:00.547
BUT IT JUST KIND OF TURNED
INTO A DISASTER.

13:00.614 --> 13:03.517
OH, IT'S A TOUGH
BUSINESS OUT THERE.

13:03.584 --> 13:05.552
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

13:05.619 --> 13:08.355
- A WHOLE TWO MONTHS.
- WOW.

13:08.422 --> 13:11.525
IT TOOK ME FOUR YEARS TO GET
ANYWHERE NEAR A SET.

13:11.592 --> 13:14.194
WELL, I GUESS I'M KINDA
BEATING YOU THEN, HUH?

13:16.496 --> 13:18.966
- OH, YOU MUST BE
VERY TALENTED.
- OH, I AM.

13:19.032 --> 13:22.636
AND AS OF TODAY
I AM INCREDIBLY
DRIVEN TO SUCCEED

13:22.703 --> 13:27.407
- WITHOUT ANYONE ELSE'S HELP.
- WOW-- TALENTED, DETERMINED
AND VERY PRETTY.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.209
YOU'RE LIKE A YOUNGER
VERSION OF ME.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.879
( GASPS )
I KNOW! LOOK.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.917
IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?
I ALWAYS SAID WE
LOOKED ALIKE.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.052
HEY, MAYBE ONE DAY
I COULD PLAY YOUR DAUGHTER.

13:39.119 --> 13:42.923
DAUGHTER?
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A STRETCH, DON'T YOU THINK?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.093
NO NO, I KNOW
HOW OLD YOU ARE.

13:48.128 --> 13:52.099
AND WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN IS WE'LL
SIT DOWN AND WE'LL LAUGH

13:52.165 --> 13:55.135
AND I'LL GO, "OH,
THIS IS JUST CRAZY.

13:55.202 --> 13:58.505
I AM A HUGE MOVIE STAR
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE WE MET

13:58.572 --> 14:01.008
ON 'DOUX PROCESS,' THAT SHOW
YOU'RE STILL FILMING.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.544
BUT IT'S OKAY."

14:03.610 --> 14:06.847
WOW, I JUST HAD
A REALLY BIG "AHA" MOMENT.

14:06.914 --> 14:11.318
I DID TOO.
I WILL SEE YOU
ON THE SET.

14:11.385 --> 14:13.053
- ALL RIGHT.
- BYE.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.023
BUH-BYE, MOM, BYE!
I JUST MADE THAT UP.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.925
THAT WAS FUNNY, RIGHT?
YOU SAW IT, RIGHT?

14:17.991 --> 14:19.993
I JUST MADE MY CHANCES...

14:25.699 --> 14:28.101
GWEN?

14:28.168 --> 14:31.605
I THINK YOU ACCIDENTALLY
LOCKED THE DOOR, GWEN!

14:33.207 --> 14:35.976
JO, HELP ME!

14:37.177 --> 14:41.114
THAT IS SO COOL.
YOU GOT TO MEET
GWEN DRESSEL.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.850

14:42.916 --> 14:44.985
<i>I THINK</i>
<i>SHE LIKES YOU.</i>

14:45.052 --> 14:47.821
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?
- DUH, I'M FILMING YOU.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.957
I WAS TRYING TO GET
SOME CANDID STUFF.

14:50.023 --> 14:53.260
WELL, SHE JUST
LOCKED US IN HERE.

14:53.327 --> 14:56.063
( GASPS )
YOUR FIRST CELEBRITY FEUD

14:56.129 --> 14:58.298
AND I GOT IT ALL.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:58.365 --> 15:02.035
- JO, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO GET OUT OF HERE.
-<i>( ENGINE STARTS )</i>

15:06.039 --> 15:08.976
WHICH IS GONNA BE
SUPER HARD NOW BECAUSE
THE TRUCK IS MOVING.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.945
DON'T PANIC.
WE CAN SURVIVE OFF

15:12.012 --> 15:14.214
THIS BAKED POTATO
THAT I STUFFED IN MY POCKET.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.328
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING
TO GO TAKE A SHOWER,
GET BACK TO SET.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.464
AUNT HONEY, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR RESCUING US.

15:30.531 --> 15:33.800
OH, IT WAS A LARK.
I HADN'T BEEN IN ONE OF
THOSE FANCY MOVIE TRAILERS

15:33.867 --> 15:37.304
SINCE I DID THAT THING
WITH WOODY ALLEN.

15:37.371 --> 15:39.806
YOU WERE IN
ONE OF HIS MOVIES?

15:39.873 --> 15:41.742
OH, HE BETTER NOT
HAVE FILMED THAT!

16:08.836 --> 16:11.538
OKAY, I FINALLY
FOUND THE TEARS.
LET'S DO THIS.

16:11.605 --> 16:13.373
ACTION.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.746
IT'S ALWAYS HARD WHEN
THEY'RE HOLDING A PET.

OKAY, WHERE'S
THE CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM

AW MAN, THERE'S MORE
TO THE COSTUME?

I KNOW THE DRILL.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.485
GEORGIA, YOU GOTTA
LET THIS GO.

16:58.552 --> 17:01.154
I'VE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY
HIDING IN TRASH CANS,

17:01.221 --> 17:02.823
BORROWING THINGS

EVERYTHING YOU COULD
TO GET THIS JOB.

NO.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.846
WHAT AM I DOING?

17:25.913 --> 17:29.750
YOU ARE GOING CRAZY
TRYING TO GET A JOB
YOU CAN'T GET.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.486
CAN'T YOU JUST SAVE THIS
FOR THE NEXT ONE?

17:32.553 --> 17:35.722

WHAT IF THERE ISN'T
A NEXT ONE?

17:37.891 --> 17:40.727

OPENING DOORS FOR ME,

THE DOORS FOR MYSELF?

17:45.999 --> 17:50.003
- THIS-- THIS IS
HOW YOU KNOW.
- WHAT?

17:50.070 --> 17:52.639
A GIRL WHO-- WHO EXPECTS
THINGS HANDED TO HER

17:52.706 --> 17:55.209

WAY BEFORE SECURITY SHOWED UP.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.378
AW, THANKS.

17:59.713 --> 18:01.982
WILL YOU TAKE THAT OFF NOW?

18:02.049 --> 18:04.451
WHAT?
IS IT FREAKING YOU OUT?

18:06.620 --> 18:10.090
IT'S LIKE IF HALLE BERRY
AND DR. PHIL HAD A SON.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.460
THIS IS FROM
THE LADY AT THE BAR.

18:18.799 --> 18:22.636

- I'M NOT TRYING TO GET
IN YOUR SHOT.

ALL RIGHT?
I'M JUST HEADING HOME.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.954

DOING IT FAST ENOUGH.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.426
CAREFUL!
HEY.

YOU REALLY NEED TO FIND SOMEONE
TO CLEAN UP THIS FAKE BLOOD.

- THAT'S A LAWSUIT WAITING
TO HAPPEN.

GEORGIA?

19:09.416 --> 19:10.817
HOW IS SHE FEELING?

19:10.884 --> 19:12.886
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY WHIPLASHED,

19:12.953 --> 19:16.223
TRAUMATIZED AND SUFFERING
FROM EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.

19:17.891 --> 19:19.826
IT'S JUST A BUMP ON THE HEAD.
I'LL BE FINE.

19:19.893 --> 19:22.829

SERIOUSLY, DON'T SPEAK.

ARE YOU A LAWYER?

NOT AN IDIOT.

THE WHOLE THING.

STOPPED RECORDING?
THAT WOULD BE SO STUPID.

BUMP ON THE HEAD
GONNA COST ME?

YOUR NATIONAL TV DEBUT.

MEETS PREPARATION...

- AND A SLAM-DUNK LAWSUIT.

EACH ONE OF MY MARRIAGES.

RIGHT THERE!

THAT'S IT?
ALL YOU ASKED FOR
WAS A FOOT ON TV?

20:37.204 --> 20:40.407
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FOOT.
WELL, LOOK AT IT UP THERE.

20:40.474 --> 20:43.177

THAT IS SOME SERIOUS
FOOT ACTING.

20:48.048 --> 20:50.517

WORKPLACE INJURY.

THAT MUCH LEVERAGE,

20:52.786 --> 20:55.756

"HONEY DOUX PROCESS."

I GOT WHAT I WANTED.

20:58.892 --> 21:01.528

NEEDED ANYMORE,

21:03.664 --> 21:05.566

TO THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD.

ON IT TONIGHT RIGHT NOW.

YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA
TAKE A SHOWER.

21:23.083 --> 21:26.987
