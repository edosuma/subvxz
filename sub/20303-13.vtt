NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:03.545 --> 00:06.965
According to ballistics,
Ms. Gilliam was shot with a .45 automatic.

00:07.048 --> 00:09.384
I'm scared, Frank. I'm really scared.

00:09.467 --> 00:10.427
We'll get 'em, Joyce.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.140
We have the gun that killed Pam Gilliam.

00:15.223 --> 00:18.351
I was there!
But I didn't know about no gun he had.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.228
Who's "he"? What's the name?

00:21.271 --> 00:23.064
Hold it right there! Freeze!

00:23.857 --> 00:25.942
JOYCE:<i> Don't let this man get away, Frank.</i>

00:26.026 --> 00:28.737
I want his head on a stake
in the middle of Decker Avenue.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.281
Big-time dope expert, huh, Crimmons?

00:31.364 --> 00:32.824
I thought you told me this guy was okay!

00:33.158 --> 00:35.326
I didn't know, Mr. Goldberg.
I thought he was cool!

00:35.702 --> 00:39.289
We traded your coke dealer for a PCP lab.
You want it?

00:39.372 --> 00:42.000
Ozzie, I would make
a lousy vice-president anyway.

00:42.333 --> 00:46.546
Well, it appears that 284 of your
fellow Black officers feel differently.

00:46.629 --> 00:50.091
You know why you got elected, bro?
Because you don't offend people.

00:50.175 --> 00:53.136
Well, I<i> want </i>to offend people.
I don't care about eating lunch with them.

00:53.219 --> 00:55.805
I'm doing what I have to do, Renko.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.307
If you can't live with it,

00:57.390 --> 00:59.059
-then I don't know--
-Go!

00:59.142 --> 01:00.602
This is my building.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.271
My hallway, my tenants. Beat it!

01:03.354 --> 01:04.606
I been in here less than five minutes.

01:04.689 --> 01:06.941
I already seen
at least eight code violations.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.318
You off the wagon now?

01:08.401 --> 01:10.153
Cheers, huh?

01:10.236 --> 01:12.906
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

01:12.989 --> 01:15.492
I hate to say it, but you were
a hell of a lot more attractive

01:15.575 --> 01:16.534
when you were drinking.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.662
I'm shakin' in my boots. (laughs)

01:19.746 --> 01:21.706
All you can do is try and scare me, see?

01:21.790 --> 01:22.874
But I don't scare.

01:22.957 --> 01:26.169
We're staging our first sit-in
at Chief Daniels's office on Wednesday.

01:26.252 --> 01:29.130
-A sit-in? Chief Daniels's office?
-Film at 11:00.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.467
JOYCE:<i> Word downtown is that</i>
<i>Pam Gilliam's killer is going to walk.</i>

01:32.550 --> 01:33.927
The P.D. who is working on the case

01:34.010 --> 01:36.137
is telling people there's something wrong
with the search.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.973
You mean this guy could actually walk?

01:39.265 --> 01:40.141
We have no case.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.895
ESTERHAUS:<i> Item 12.</i>

01:44.854 --> 01:48.108
There's a memo out of Division
as regards a new pamphlet...

01:48.650 --> 01:51.820
available from the Department
of Occupational Safety and Health.

01:52.654 --> 01:56.407
Said pamphlet is described
as being "profusely illustrated,"

01:56.783 --> 01:58.618
"must reading," and it's free.

01:58.827 --> 02:04.374
I confess, I'm a bit in the dark, however,
as to its nature, contents-wise.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.793
Um, the title is

02:06.876 --> 02:10.547
<i>You, Your Loved Ones and Gentle Herps.</i>

02:11.172 --> 02:14.759
Uh, Sarge, I think that's genital, uh...

02:16.010 --> 02:17.762
-Herpes.
-(laughter)

02:18.096 --> 02:20.598
Regardless, Commander Thompson
seems to feel

02:20.682 --> 02:23.810
that, uh, loved-one-wise and health-wise,

02:23.893 --> 02:26.104
you'll want to keep this one
in your glove compartment.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.939
Item 13.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.401
Officer Hill has an announcement.
Officer Hill.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.030
(clears throat) Thanks.

02:37.448 --> 02:40.285
There is an open membership meeting

02:40.368 --> 02:43.246
for the Black Officers Coalition
to be held

02:43.538 --> 02:47.959
at the main conference hall at Division,
Friday, 8:00.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.838
Uh, if you-- if you have any questions,

02:52.046 --> 02:53.631
um, you can see-- you can see me.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.302
ESTERHAUS:
All right. The last item, item 14.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.511
(man grunting)

03:00.305 --> 03:01.181
What is that?

03:01.264 --> 03:02.974
-(grunting continues)
-WOMAN: What is that?

03:06.936 --> 03:10.440
Oh. Mick, would you please see to that?

03:11.774 --> 03:15.278
To all uniformed officers,
Classes H-3 through H-5,

03:15.361 --> 03:18.156
receiving checks yesterday
in the amount of

03:18.239 --> 03:20.825
-$42,182...
-(impressed whistle)

03:20.909 --> 03:23.453
(indistinct chattering)

03:23.536 --> 03:27.832
...as opposed to their normal $421.82,

03:28.917 --> 03:34.505
please be advised that Division is aware
of the double-digit computer glitch,

03:34.923 --> 03:40.428
and personnel are sternly warned against
attempting to cash said instruments.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.722
All right. That's it. Let's roll.

03:43.973 --> 03:47.769
And hey. Hey! Let's be careful out there.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.399
-(shouts)
-What are they doing, Lieutenant?

03:53.483 --> 03:54.651
Oh, it's...

03:55.193 --> 03:59.030
It's textbook stress conversion techniques
of the Imperial Japanese Marines,

03:59.113 --> 04:02.617
-prior to their rape of Manchuria in 1932.
-(man grunts)

04:04.452 --> 04:05.662
Therapy, Detective.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.874
Venting one's rage
through the martial arts discipline.

04:09.958 --> 04:10.875
(shouts)

04:15.046 --> 04:17.590
Just seems to me
like you guys are doing it all wrong.

04:18.883 --> 04:22.011
Oh? Well, as you were, gentlemen.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.016
Maybe you'd like to show us.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.903
(growling)

04:50.164 --> 04:51.040
There, you see?

04:51.958 --> 04:54.377
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:54.627 --> 04:56.337
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:56.421 --> 05:00.133
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:00.216 --> 05:01.884
(sirens wailing)

05:07.307 --> 05:09.309
(theme music playing)

06:07.867 --> 06:09.494
-(typing)
-(phones ringing)

06:20.088 --> 06:22.924
Hey, hey, hey, LaRue. Where you been?
Sleeping under a bush?

06:23.007 --> 06:25.176
-I can't begin to explain, man.
-Well, you better.

06:25.259 --> 06:28.429
-Captain's looking for us.
-Give me five minutes to splash my face.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.102
Renko.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.105
Renko, you're gonna be teamed up
with Stan Grebey

06:37.188 --> 06:38.439
for the next couple of days.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.358
He's just transferred
over from Washington Heights.

06:40.441 --> 06:42.235
You mean, Stan Grebey?

06:43.444 --> 06:45.655
Uh, w-- what about Bobby Hill?

06:45.738 --> 06:47.323
Bobby's on special assignment,
per Division:

06:47.407 --> 06:50.201
two days of BOC recruitment,
here and in the Heights.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.995
-I'm looking for Andy Renko.
-He's over there.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.122
Thanks.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.625
Hey, you Renko?

06:58.042 --> 07:00.420
Why, yes, I am. And you must be, uh--

07:00.503 --> 07:01.462
Read the sign.

07:02.004 --> 07:04.590
-Come on. Let's hit it. We're late.
-Well, now, Stan the Man,

07:04.674 --> 07:08.594
that's not exactly how me and Bobby Hill
do it up here on the day shift.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.305
You see, first,
I gotta take my morning sit-down.

07:11.722 --> 07:15.309
So if you'd like to hold your water
for about ten minutes, I'll be right back.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.979
Yeah, suit yourself, tiger.

07:18.396 --> 07:21.566
FURILLO: Just as I arrived this morning
I received a call from Jerry Fuchs.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.025
It was about you, J.D.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.029
He said you missed your meet last night.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.284
Yeah, the dude never showed.
(laughs) What a tap dance.

07:31.617 --> 07:35.621
I must've looked in ten different joints.
I got about an hour's sleep. Don't worry.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.124
I got another meet set in 45 minutes.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.585
We'll still be able
to hit the lab this afternoon?

07:40.877 --> 07:44.672
Copacetic, Captain. Warrants are ready.
Everything should go.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.134
Okay. Keep me posted.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.684
Better not be jacking us up
on this one, J.D.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.436
I don't want to be walking
into a shootin' gallery.

07:58.519 --> 07:59.645
Hey, come on.

07:59.854 --> 08:02.064
Would I do that to you?
We're talking trust here.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.734
-No, we are talking survival, man.
-Come on. Would ya?

08:07.778 --> 08:11.073
You know, for a two-bit outpost
on the edge of the civilized world,

08:11.157 --> 08:12.742
there is some first-rate talent

08:12.825 --> 08:14.577
-comes through here.
-Come on, man.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.871
Ray, if anyone wants to know,
I'm down at the Housing Authority.

08:16.954 --> 08:19.707
See if there's any way I can get 'em
to declare war on that Sosa character.

08:20.166 --> 08:24.629
Talk to Ernie Silvera down there. He loves
a lost cause almost as much as you do.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.005
I'll tell him you said hello.

08:36.641 --> 08:39.977
Oh! Oh, hello, precious. (chuckles)

08:40.353 --> 08:42.438
(speaking French)

08:42.897 --> 08:46.400
Oh. (speaks French)
(in English) You shouldn't have.

08:53.115 --> 08:56.452
<i>-Debbie Does Des Moines.</i>
-Thank you. (chuckles)

08:57.912 --> 09:00.373
-What's the occasion?
-I have a problem.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.167
Sweetness, what's the matter?
(speaks in French)

09:04.001 --> 09:06.170
Of all things, a dog.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.715
(in English) Grace. A dog?

09:11.008 --> 09:12.927
In my building, Phil.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.764
It barks all night, and the landlord
won't do anything.

09:16.847 --> 09:22.186
And the owner is a mean, vicious, beastly,
insensitive human being.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.481
I have tried reasoning.
I have tried talking. I have tried...

09:26.440 --> 09:28.776
In desperation,
I finally called the police,

09:28.859 --> 09:30.403
and they won't do anything either.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.780
I'm at my wit's end.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.324
I'll give Chick Spillman in Midtown
a call.

09:37.785 --> 09:41.038
Word downtown is that Pam Gilliam's killer
is going to walk.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.999
-What?
-The P.D. who is working on the case

09:43.082 --> 09:45.084
is telling people there's something wrong
with the search.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.795
-Frank, if you guys blew this one--
-Oh, that's crazy.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.005
The search was by the numbers.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.507
I'm on my way
to see the assistant D.A. right now.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.758
Can I tag along?

09:52.842 --> 09:54.885
-You won't even know I'm there.
-Sure. Come on.

09:54.969 --> 09:58.973
I'm afraid, Frank. Not this one.
God, not this one.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.768
Now, I understand your situation,
personnel-wise.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.858
Chick, would you mind very much

10:08.941 --> 10:11.777
if I intrude myself into your precinct
on this one?

10:13.779 --> 10:16.032
(laughing) I owe you, fella.

10:17.325 --> 10:20.786
The dog's owner is Buck Mullins,
and he's home until noon.

10:20.870 --> 10:21.704
(sniffles)

10:22.830 --> 10:24.332
(dialing)

10:31.297 --> 10:35.259
Mr. Mullins, this is Sergeant
Phil Esterhaus, Metropolitan Police.

10:35.343 --> 10:39.263
Uh, we have a complainant
named Grace Gardner.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.598
(Mullins speaking indistinctly)

10:40.681 --> 10:43.434
ESTERHAUS: Name calling
is not gonna solve the problem.

10:44.977 --> 10:48.648
I assure you, sir,
I am indeed a police officer.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.858
(indistinct shouting)

10:51.275 --> 10:53.736
-Now, just a--
-(line clicks)

10:54.487 --> 10:55.571
(receiver clatters)

10:56.781 --> 11:00.534
"Floozy." "Bozo." "Bogus"!

11:03.371 --> 11:04.538
Excuse me, Grace.

11:08.584 --> 11:12.171
Bates, when Coffey terminates his
ablutions, go pick this individual up.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.091
Sarge, this is in Midtown.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.718
I don't care if it's Costa Rica.
Go pick him up!

11:38.906 --> 11:39.740
(blows)

11:40.408 --> 11:43.160
Sorry about last night, man.
Lost my moneyman.

11:44.161 --> 11:46.789
By the time the deal got all wired,
you were gone, man.

11:47.498 --> 11:48.624
Got your first payment?

11:49.291 --> 11:50.292
Hey, no sweat.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.004
(footsteps approaching)

11:56.173 --> 11:57.633
Put it in the glove compartment.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.971
Gonna have to wait 48 hours now.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.433
-Say what?
-You never showed. Had another customer.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.685
Oh, man, come on. You can't do this to me.

12:07.768 --> 12:10.062
I don't make this deal today,
I'm in the toilet.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.107
-Waited two hours last night.
-Oh, man.

12:13.441 --> 12:16.485
You know what domestic problems guys
like you cause guys like me?

12:17.194 --> 12:18.487
I stay out past 2:00 in the morning,

12:18.571 --> 12:20.281
the wife thinks
I'm getting the whistle wet.

12:20.614 --> 12:24.869
-I don't need that, flake-head.
-Hey, man, I can dig it, huh? Never again.

12:24.952 --> 12:28.998
I'm a businessman.
All day I deal with other businessmen.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.500
I bet a jerk like you
can't even get Master Charge.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.128
Hey. Hey, hey, look. I said I'm sorry.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.923
-You a junkie? Alkie? What?
-I told ya, huh?

12:38.174 --> 12:39.383
It was a screw-up.

12:41.135 --> 12:44.263
Don't flush me, man.
I'm gonna be a gangbusters customer.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.266
Give ya a break.

12:48.559 --> 12:52.605
-Meet me at the place, 4:00 sharp.
-Hey, you got it, Bert.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.107
And I really appreciate, huh?

12:55.941 --> 12:57.485
-Do me a favor though.
-Yeah?

12:57.860 --> 12:59.653
Do something with yourself, would ya?

13:00.237 --> 13:02.656
You're an embarrassment
to be seen in public with.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.082
There's two ways to get out.
Front's on Delaware.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.043
That'll be Tepaz and O'Keefe.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.504
-(chalk tapping)
-Back is on Tudor.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.713
That's where the Doberman is.

13:17.797 --> 13:22.134
Sirwell, you take care of that. Break in
these windows. Peterson'll be on the roof.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.386
-How many inside?
-Five or six.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.306
-What's the chances of fire on this one?
-Fairly extreme.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.225
Ventilation's through windows
and vents only.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.478
The place is loaded with goodies,
and they don't steel-cabinet a thing.

13:32.561 --> 13:33.938
(Hunter chuckling)

13:35.481 --> 13:37.942
Eh, you want me to tell 'em,
Jer, or you wanna tell 'em?

13:38.567 --> 13:40.486
Uh, no, go ahead, Howard.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.238
(chuckles)

13:43.197 --> 13:48.828
Jer and I flushed out
a phenylcyclohexyl piperidine factory

13:48.911 --> 13:50.496
on Ohio Street last year.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.623
Now, it was your, uh,

13:52.873 --> 13:56.794
it was your classic bilateral
warehouse siege maneuvers,

13:57.253 --> 14:00.422
with 200 gallons of ether.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.508
(chuckles)

14:03.425 --> 14:07.513
Ballantine jumps the gun
and fires in a tear-gas grenade.

14:07.847 --> 14:12.476
(laughing) You could have heard
the explosion half way to Uganda.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.019
You-- you remember, Jer?

14:14.103 --> 14:16.772
Two of the perpetrators
came screaming out the front door,

14:16.856 --> 14:19.817
looking like they'd had Roman-candle
suppositories for lunch,

14:19.900 --> 14:22.570
and the third guy-- (chuckles)

14:22.903 --> 14:26.115
the third guy broad jumps
through the second-story window

14:26.198 --> 14:28.033
into the Ganson Street Canal.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.910
(Hunter laughing)

14:31.078 --> 14:32.746
I'm sorry, sorry!

14:33.873 --> 14:37.751
Oh, Judas H., it was funny. Oh!

14:38.252 --> 14:39.920
-Anything else to add?
-(door shuts)

14:40.004 --> 14:42.923
Yeah. The code word is "soup."

14:43.007 --> 14:44.216
I'll be wired.
I'll go in through the front.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.219
On "soup" you guys boot the door.
That's it.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.513
Good work, John. Looks like we're all set.

14:50.848 --> 14:51.807
Any questions?

14:54.184 --> 14:56.228
Okay, that's it. Good luck.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.356
(indistinct chattering)

15:09.742 --> 15:11.368
Sarge, we got your Mr. Mullins.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.329
He require any backup?

15:14.121 --> 15:15.164
-No.
-No.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.917
Where have you got him? In Holding?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.003
No, he's over by your desk.
The little guy.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.553
You're Buck Mullins?

15:29.637 --> 15:32.097
Who were you expecting,
the Oakland Hell's Angels?

15:33.098 --> 15:37.478
Okay, Sarge. I'm not moving, and I'm not
gettin' rid of my dog, and that's that.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.023
Mr. Mullins, please.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.612
Mrs. Gardner's not asking you
to dislodge your canine.

15:46.695 --> 15:50.574
Merely lower his decibel range,
as it were.

15:50.658 --> 15:54.244
I might add that your belligerence
towards her complaints

15:54.328 --> 15:57.331
has not exactly mollified the situation.

15:57.414 --> 16:01.919
Well, let me add, Sergeant, that the lady
is no angel herself, you know.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.963
You know, ever since her husband died,

16:04.046 --> 16:07.466
the noises coming out of that apartment
are unbelievable.

16:08.175 --> 16:10.552
Noises? What sort of noises?

16:10.886 --> 16:14.014
She runs around
with a six-and-a-half-foot palooka

16:14.098 --> 16:17.059
who makes a sound like a wounded rhino
through the walls

16:17.142 --> 16:18.727
every time he gets excited.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.272
A wounded rhino?

16:22.606 --> 16:24.858
Mm-hmm. You wanna talk animals?

16:25.150 --> 16:27.486
This pug and Mrs. Gardner

16:27.569 --> 16:31.240
make<i> Call of the Wild</i>
sound like a Baby Snooks album.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.451
They oughta bring in Marlin Perkins
for the color commentary.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.287
To get back to your dog, Mr. Mullins--

16:37.538 --> 16:40.207
Okay, Sarge. Let's clear the air.

16:42.042 --> 16:45.254
You wanna know the real history
behind this beef of hers?

16:45.337 --> 16:46.338
The straight skinny?

16:47.256 --> 16:51.218
The fact is, last year,
Mrs. Gardner and I had an affair.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.763
You... and Mrs. Gardner?

16:54.847 --> 16:59.059
She's the one that gave me the dog,
a Weimaraner named Floyd.

16:59.476 --> 17:02.855
Yeah, he was a pup then,
but he goes a good 90 pounds now.

17:02.938 --> 17:06.650
This woman is bizarro with a capital "B."

17:07.276 --> 17:11.113
Get this, she gave me leather sheets
for my birthday.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.873
HILL: Don't get me wrong, Alf. I'm not
trying to pressure you into anything.

17:20.956 --> 17:25.002
I just think that you ought to reconsider.
Coalition could use you.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.963
You look uncomfortable, Bobby.
You really like what you're doing?

17:28.255 --> 17:31.675
I was elected to an office, Alf,
and I accepted. Simple as that.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.762
Now, what do you say?
You gonna come to a meeting?

17:35.095 --> 17:37.473
I've been with the department
nearly 20 years, Bobby.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.684
This place is a model for racial equality

17:41.060 --> 17:43.896
compared to what it was,
like when I first joined.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.731
You could have cut it
with a knife back then.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.191
It's all relative, Alf.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.317
-There's--
-Report okay?

17:49.151 --> 17:50.861
There's still a long way to go.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.239
Forgive the cliché,
but if you're not part of the solution,

17:54.323 --> 17:55.949
-then you're part of--
-You young boys

17:56.033 --> 17:59.244
think you discover all the problems
driving to work this morning.

17:59.578 --> 18:02.873
We had our own big push back
in 1968, Bobby.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.919
After the energy died down
and the talks stopped,

18:07.127 --> 18:10.089
the only ones that got hurt
were the ones that stuck their necks out.

18:10.172 --> 18:13.759
I was one of them.
Real hot prospect in my day.

18:14.176 --> 18:17.221
Got my wings clipped,
if you understand what I'm saying.

18:18.347 --> 18:22.309
Alf, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to imply anything.

18:22.392 --> 18:26.522
I like you, Bobby. I appreciate what you
and the coalition are trying to do.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.233
But I've got my own way
of doing things now.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.571
-Hey, Bobby, where's Andrew J.?
-How in the hell should I know?

18:38.325 --> 18:40.911
Hey, Ellis. Wait a minute, man.

18:40.994 --> 18:44.665
(sighs) The coalition meeting
is just on my mind, and I...

18:44.748 --> 18:47.167
(police radio chatter)

18:47.251 --> 18:49.461
RENKO: So big deal.
So you were there last night.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.797
Is there any law that says you can't visit
your father in the hospital

18:51.880 --> 18:52.840
two days in a row?

18:53.257 --> 18:56.385
Listen to you. He's been in there a week.
You haven't been to see him once.

18:56.468 --> 18:59.513
Well, that's why I want to go tonight.
Come on, Trace.

18:59.805 --> 19:03.183
We'll just get ourselves a spaghetti
dinner and go down there and visit him.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.770
It'll be me and you and Tommy and Dad.
A regular family get-together.

19:06.854 --> 19:10.732
We already had our annual get-together,
Andy, last Thanksgiving.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.153
As I remember, you spent the day
with Bobby Hill and his folks.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.863
Look, I'm sorry about that.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.323
I know you went to all that kind
of trouble, and I'm sorry.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.284
But I cannot take evenings like that,

19:20.367 --> 19:22.870
everybody sitting around the house
for eight hours,

19:22.953 --> 19:24.079
nobody talking to one another,

19:24.163 --> 19:27.541
watching Dad get more and more drunk
and moody over Mom dying.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.794
So why are you so anxious
for everybody to get together now?

19:33.881 --> 19:37.551
I don't know. It's like we all sort of
split apart, you know?

19:38.719 --> 19:40.679
Maybe I wasn't ready for it,
but I'm beginning to think that a--

19:40.762 --> 19:43.807
a family should just stay together
no matter what.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.519
Don't you think it's a little late
for that now, Andy?

19:50.522 --> 19:53.275
Let's hurry it up, Renko.
We just got a 211 ten blocks away.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.610
You just wait a minute.

19:56.778 --> 19:57.613
New partner?

19:58.947 --> 20:01.658
-Now, are you comin', or what?
-I told you, Andrew.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.785
I already made plans.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.915
If you can't, you can't. Simple as that.

20:12.336 --> 20:17.424
Andy. You're afraid to see him alone.
Isn't that it?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.594
Let's go, Renko.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.978
-(shouting, clamoring)
-(sirens wailing)

20:31.104 --> 20:32.189
Be cool with those things, guys.

20:36.318 --> 20:39.821
Gang kids. Roy and my husband
chased them out back.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.452
Hey, we were only kidding around.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.581
-(shouting)
-BATES: Hey, he's gettin' away!

20:53.418 --> 20:54.836
-Right there.
-You all right?

20:57.256 --> 20:58.840
(chattering in distance)

21:17.776 --> 21:20.028
-Ow!
-(grunts)

21:25.158 --> 21:27.327
-(approaching footsteps)
-Oh, Mama.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.207
-On your feet, punk! Against the door!
-Grebey!

21:32.291 --> 21:35.210
Look at this, man! Where were you,
damn it? I could have got killed!

21:35.294 --> 21:37.170
It's your own fault for taking off
like that, hot dog.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.798
Man, you're supposed to back me!
That's your job!

21:40.757 --> 21:43.802
I know my job, Renko. So jam it!

21:50.058 --> 21:52.978
Bobby would've been here, you big slob.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.146
(grunting)

22:00.819 --> 22:01.653
MAN: Frank.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.410
Come on.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.581
There's been a tragic, horrible screw-up.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.250
That's the only way I know
how to describe it.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.713
The city's contract with Barney's Garage
expired six weeks ago.

22:19.963 --> 22:22.215
The owner, Kazmarek,
never bothered to renew.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.301
What does that have to do with anything?

22:24.760 --> 22:27.804
Frank, did you have a search warrant
to retrieve that gun?

22:27.888 --> 22:31.224
Of course not. We got it during the
inventory search, pursuant to the impound.

22:31.308 --> 22:34.686
But the car was taken over to Barney's,
whose license was expired.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.397
So, legally, the car
wasn't in our possession.

22:38.065 --> 22:40.192
No possession, no legal impound,

22:40.275 --> 22:42.486
no reason or right
for an inventory search.

22:42.694 --> 22:46.907
Oh, come on. Just because some papers
weren't signed?

22:47.866 --> 22:50.619
No court's gonna throw out a murder weapon
on the basis of that.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.829
Not only will they throw out the weapon,

22:53.246 --> 22:54.831
but Bragg's confession as well,

22:54.915 --> 22:57.626
because it was coerced
through our possession of the weapon.

22:59.544 --> 23:00.962
I don't-- I don't believe this.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.299
I just-- I just don't believe it.
It's not possible.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.675
I wouldn't believe it either.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.845
But a major drug case
came down two weeks ago.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.723
Franzia,
reversed for the identical reason.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.017
Franzia hired some F. Lee Bailey-type

23:14.101 --> 23:16.353
who uncovered the quirk
about the garage license.

23:17.562 --> 23:18.688
And you didn't appeal it?

23:19.898 --> 23:21.691
Immediately. The next day.

23:22.150 --> 23:22.984
We lost.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.237
And unfortunately, Frank,

23:25.570 --> 23:27.781
I can't place the blame
on my office for this one.

23:27.989 --> 23:30.951
After Franzia, we urgently memoed Division

23:31.034 --> 23:33.161
not to have you use lapsed garages.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.331
Apparently, the memo got put in a drawer.

23:37.666 --> 23:38.542
Wai...

23:39.876 --> 23:42.754
You mean this guy could actually walk?

23:43.505 --> 23:45.507
As of now, we have no case.

23:46.216 --> 23:49.094
If we indicted, the speedy trial rules
would run against us.

23:51.888 --> 23:54.683
We have to let him go,
and hope we can build something.

23:55.183 --> 23:58.520
Suppose we get Bragg to testify in court
against the shooter?

23:58.812 --> 23:59.980
(cell door slamming)

24:19.374 --> 24:21.543
-Counselor.
-Mr. Bragg.

24:22.878 --> 24:26.673
If Wilbur walks, he's gonna kill you,
Tyler, because you informed on him.

24:27.716 --> 24:31.386
I know Hump all my life.
I can handle it, you know?

24:31.803 --> 24:34.014
Oh, really? You can handle being shot,
huh, Tyler?

24:34.764 --> 24:38.643
You know what it's like to be shot?
In the gut, in the groin, in the face?

24:39.644 --> 24:41.980
You know what it's like
to take a bullet in the face?

24:42.647 --> 24:44.941
But if you testify
against Wilbur, he'll be gone.

24:45.775 --> 24:48.737
And I can practically guarantee you
three years max.

24:48.820 --> 24:53.241
I should sit inside for three years
when I can walk outside that door?

24:53.700 --> 24:55.076
Know this, Bragg.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.497
We're gonna make this case
if it takes until you're dead.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.333
Who you kidding, chief?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.835
You ain't got squat.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.254
If you could do it, you'd do it.

25:06.880 --> 25:11.134
What my client's indicating, Captain,
that in his own best interest here,

25:11.635 --> 25:14.346
when you do have something,
we'll talk business.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.475
"Business," Mr. Schwartz?
We're not talking business here.

25:18.558 --> 25:21.228
We're talking murder,
and we're talking justice.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.896
You believe that, bro?

25:24.189 --> 25:25.941
When they got no business to talk,

25:26.024 --> 25:28.902
they start talking like
it's for<i> Time </i>magazine.

25:29.778 --> 25:33.073
"I'm talking murder. I'm talking justice."

25:33.156 --> 25:38.245
(laughing maniacally)

25:38.954 --> 25:40.872
JOYCE: They lost the memo in a drawer?

25:42.290 --> 25:45.377
They lost the memo in a drawer,
and those animals are gonna walk?

25:46.336 --> 25:48.463
Joyce, there's gonna be justice
for Pam Gilliam.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.590
I don't know how, exactly,
but there will be.

25:51.132 --> 25:54.135
No, there won't. I don't believe that
at all. Not at all.

25:54.761 --> 25:56.513
It's the final travesty of everything.

26:02.018 --> 26:03.812
I've wasted nearly the entire damn morning

26:03.895 --> 26:05.647
tap dancing with those loads
down at Housing Authority.

26:05.730 --> 26:06.565
Housing Authority?

26:06.648 --> 26:08.483
The landlord situation
I told you about, Frank.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.736
First-rate shark, this Sosa character.
Forces the rent-control tenants out,

26:11.820 --> 26:13.780
then brings in new people
at triple the rents.

26:13.863 --> 26:16.283
-Silvera could not help you?
-We went round and round,

26:16.366 --> 26:17.659
but the bottom line was<i> nada.</i>

26:18.326 --> 26:19.327
Do we want to do anything?

26:19.411 --> 26:21.204
I guess they'll just have to take it
to renter's court.

26:21.288 --> 26:24.249
Oh, great. So he gets cited for a couple
of building-code violations.

26:24.332 --> 26:26.585
Enough citations pile up,
they condemn the building.

26:26.668 --> 26:29.129
Sosa abandons it, collects the insurance,
and who loses?

26:29.379 --> 26:32.048
All those helpless people, that's who.
Right out on the street.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.633
You know what the real killer is?

26:34.134 --> 26:35.927
He was laughing
when I was up there yesterday.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.137
He knew I had nothing on him.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.472
We're already two weeks behind
in our caseload, Henry.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.308
As bad as it is, it's not our job.

26:41.391 --> 26:42.517
If you can't make it happen,

26:42.601 --> 26:44.311
-just let it go.
-Henry--

26:44.394 --> 26:47.897
COFFEY: Don't give me a problem now.
Come on. Right through the door. Let's go.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.192
-You stinkin'--
-You wanna end up in Emergency?

26:51.401 --> 26:53.111
Huh? Let's go!

26:57.157 --> 26:59.492
Mrs. Gardner? Mrs. Gardner.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.412
If you wouldn't mind
waiting down in Roll Call,

27:02.495 --> 27:04.706
the sergeant said
that he'll be down in just a minute.

27:04.789 --> 27:08.376
-It's right down the stairs--
-I've been there before, Leo.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.547
But Buck Mullins?

27:13.214 --> 27:16.426
That repellent, little ferret-faced twerp.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.846
It was barely a week
after Sam died, darling.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.931
I was still in a state of shock.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.060
Grace, how could you?

27:27.354 --> 27:30.065
I don't feel I have to justify
my personal life, Phil--

27:30.940 --> 27:35.028
particularly with regard to events
that occurred before we met.

27:35.111 --> 27:37.781
The man writes comic books for a living.

27:37.864 --> 27:42.619
(sighs) I suppose it was a sort of
postmortem libidinal urge.

27:42.702 --> 27:46.081
I felt very alone at the time.

27:47.749 --> 27:50.502
He came up to borrow some drain cleaner
late one evening

27:50.585 --> 27:52.462
and ended up staying the night.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.342
Well, I didn't plan it that way.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.178
To think you actually solicited
my involvement

28:00.261 --> 28:02.347
in this sordid personal episode.

28:02.889 --> 28:06.685
I have never been so humiliated
in my entire life.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.896
Oh, darling, I'm sorry.

28:10.563 --> 28:14.484
But that howling beast hasn't allowed me
a proper sleep for weeks.

28:14.567 --> 28:17.946
A proper penance, I would say. (chuckles)

28:18.571 --> 28:22.534
And who else in that building have you
gifted with Weimaraners, hmm?

28:23.034 --> 28:24.452
The superintendent, perhaps?

28:25.870 --> 28:27.872
I can see this is leading nowhere.

28:28.164 --> 28:32.001
How about the janitor? Is he sleeping
on leather sheets too?

28:32.085 --> 28:36.423
Oh, for goodness sake, Phil!
I got those leather sheets as a gift.

28:36.506 --> 28:39.384
I didn't like the grain,
and I dumped them on Mullins.

28:39.718 --> 28:43.179
You got them as a gift? From who?

28:52.522 --> 28:54.899
I suppose you've heard
of the Green Bay Packers?

28:54.983 --> 28:55.817
(gasps)

28:56.735 --> 28:58.403
Oh, relax, Phil.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.030
It was only the offensive line.

29:03.116 --> 29:05.118
(footsteps departing)

29:09.414 --> 29:10.957
(siren wailing in distance)

29:15.420 --> 29:17.005
-(knocking)
-HENRY: Mr. Bustamonte?

29:17.088 --> 29:19.090
-Who is it?
-Uh, sorry.

29:19.466 --> 29:20.842
It's, uh, Sergeant Goldblume.

29:21.509 --> 29:23.970
-What do you want?
-I just want to talk to you.

29:25.805 --> 29:29.267
Well, listen. I don't have time to talk
right now.

29:29.476 --> 29:30.477
I'm moving out.

29:32.395 --> 29:33.897
Good God, what happened?

29:37.650 --> 29:40.111
I ran into an obstruction of justice.

29:40.987 --> 29:43.531
My fault for believing there was anything
I could do about it.

29:44.032 --> 29:47.160
If Sosa's responsible for this,
you file the charges. I'll put him away.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.497
I don't want to do anything
for you or anybody.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.541
-I can live with the face.
-(door opens)

29:54.000 --> 29:55.335
I can't live with anything happening

29:55.418 --> 29:56.795
-to my wife and my kid.
-(door closes)

29:57.170 --> 30:00.590
Listen, I came back because I want to put
that little tyrant in his place.

30:00.673 --> 30:03.635
The only way that's gonna happen
is if someone talks to a judge.

30:03.718 --> 30:05.970
You, one of the other tenants.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.139
He threatened your family!

30:08.932 --> 30:12.352
No one knows better than me
how well the police can help.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.145
(footsteps approaching)

30:16.648 --> 30:17.482
Where is he?

30:19.901 --> 30:20.819
Is he in his office?

30:25.490 --> 30:26.783
He's always there.

30:29.536 --> 30:30.495
Hey, wait a minute.

30:31.913 --> 30:35.416
Whatever you're gonna do, uh,
will you wait till I get out of here?

30:37.919 --> 30:40.296
-(phones ringing)
-(indistinct chattering)

30:40.880 --> 30:42.340
(phone rings)

30:43.925 --> 30:47.428
-Yeah, Belker.
-Mick. Good. This is Henry. You busy?

30:47.512 --> 30:49.055
Always. What do you want?

30:49.639 --> 30:52.350
I've got a situation
that could use a little assistance.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.519
I need you and the two noseguards
from the night shift.

30:55.395 --> 30:59.649
Homer and Cydel? What's the matter,
you lose some cattle on the expressway?

31:00.108 --> 31:02.360
Mick, you ever wish you could get even
with your high school bully?

31:02.902 --> 31:06.155
-I did.
-Well, this is gonna be better.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.033
(siren wailing)

31:11.452 --> 31:13.872
So how are those double "A" meetings
coming along?

31:16.165 --> 31:18.501
-You're still going, aren't you?
-Thanks.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.003
Uh, off and on.

31:21.504 --> 31:23.590
Uh, let's change the subject, okay?

31:24.716 --> 31:26.301
You have a plane to catch, or what?

31:26.885 --> 31:29.387
You've been eyeing that watch of yours
ever since you sat down.

31:29.470 --> 31:33.850
Got a special duty assignment.
4:00. No big deal.

31:35.059 --> 31:36.811
I don't want to talk about that, okay?

31:39.522 --> 31:41.441
You got a lot of nerve,
you know that, J.D.?

31:41.983 --> 31:44.569
I don't hear word one
from you for over three weeks,

31:44.652 --> 31:46.863
and then suddenly,
for some as yet unknown reason,

31:46.946 --> 31:49.490
you call up and you want
to monopolize my afternoon.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.118
I know you got dressed up, and I'm--

31:52.201 --> 31:55.496
But I thought, why not?
Lunch at some nice, romantic spot.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.416
Maybe he wants to pick up
where we left off.

31:58.499 --> 32:00.251
But you don't want to go out.
You don't want to go to bed.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.295
I mean, just what did you
come up here for anyway?

32:02.378 --> 32:06.215
I-- I don't know. I-- I'm a little shaky.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.594
I just needed somebody
to talk to, I guess.

32:09.969 --> 32:11.721
Well, if you're looking
for a surrogate crutch

32:11.804 --> 32:13.848
to get you through the afternoon, J.D.,

32:14.349 --> 32:15.808
you came to the wrong place.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.978
Oh, you're really something,
you know that?

32:20.688 --> 32:24.233
I come up here for a little support,
a little understanding. What do I get?

32:24.776 --> 32:27.862
-I could've done better with a $20 hooker!
-(crashing)

32:28.112 --> 32:31.115
You've always had more than your share
of character defects, J.D.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.242
But up till now,
self-pity wasn't one of them.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.036
Oh, yeah.

32:35.870 --> 32:38.206
I hate to say it, but you were
a hell of a lot more attractive

32:38.289 --> 32:39.332
when you were drinking.

32:42.627 --> 32:43.461
(door closes)

32:45.004 --> 32:46.089
(indistinct sports broadcast)

32:46.172 --> 32:49.008
-What do you want?
-Sergeant Goldblume, Mr. Sosa.

32:49.759 --> 32:53.096
-I was here--
-Yeah, I remember. So what?

32:54.263 --> 32:56.557
Those safety violations
I noticed on my first visit,

32:56.641 --> 32:57.684
they haven't been fixed.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.435
I thought I'd stop by and remind you.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.896
Get out of here.

33:02.313 --> 33:03.898
Not this time, Mr. Sosa.

33:05.024 --> 33:07.110
Your sweaty little reign
of terror is over.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.821
I'm the law in this building now.

33:10.822 --> 33:11.656
(furniture scrapes)

33:17.286 --> 33:19.330
What the hell is that
supposed to mean, huh?

33:20.039 --> 33:22.458
-I'm knockin' you off your throne.
-Oh.

33:23.543 --> 33:25.461
You've intimidated these people
long enough.

33:26.129 --> 33:30.133
Up till now the law's been on your side,
because it's been slack and indifferent.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.176
That's changed.

33:33.761 --> 33:35.430
Now, you either fix this hellhole,

33:35.930 --> 33:38.182
make it a safe and decent place
to live in,

33:39.517 --> 33:41.978
or I'm gonna see you get more trouble
than you can cause.

33:42.061 --> 33:43.771
(chuckling)

33:44.981 --> 33:48.776
Oh, I'm-- I'm shakin' in my boots,
Jew boy!

33:48.860 --> 33:50.153
(laughs)

33:50.445 --> 33:52.947
You're gonna have to do better than that!
(laughs)

33:53.031 --> 33:55.491
(growling)

33:57.201 --> 33:58.995
Now, you ain't got a legal leg
to stand on. You know that.

33:59.078 --> 34:01.080
That's why you brung along these types.

34:01.998 --> 34:05.001
All you can do is try and scare me, see?
But I don't scare!

34:05.084 --> 34:07.003
What's the fist for, Sosa?
You can't hit me.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.297
I'm under 65. Nobody's holding my arms.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.009
A man like you doesn't have the guts
to start a fair fight.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.094
You little punk! I'll shut--

34:15.178 --> 34:16.721
You saw it. Assaulting a police officer.

34:19.724 --> 34:20.558
(grunts)

34:21.225 --> 34:23.936
Hey, you can't do this to me!
I got lawyers!

34:24.020 --> 34:24.854
All right.

34:26.105 --> 34:28.524
You know what it's like
in custody lockup, Sosa?

34:29.233 --> 34:30.860
People living in each other's stink.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.446
Food that leaves your gut aching
after every meal.

34:33.529 --> 34:36.699
The lice are so bad they crawl
under your bedsores and lay their eggs.

34:37.450 --> 34:38.659
And you think you're tough?

34:39.577 --> 34:41.037
You haven't seen anything
till you've snuggled up

34:41.120 --> 34:42.497
with an 18-year-old sociopath...

34:42.580 --> 34:44.624
who's just killed his mother
with a tire iron.

34:46.167 --> 34:48.294
Assaulting an officer is only for openers.

34:50.046 --> 34:53.841
I swear to you, Sosa, if you hurt these
people one more time, I'll put you there.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.010
Doesn't matter what the charge is.
I'll find one.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.387
And when you're out,
I'll come after you again.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.516
You don't want that, Sosa.

35:02.600 --> 35:05.019
Take it from an angry cop.
You'd rather die first.

35:12.985 --> 35:13.820
(tires screech)

35:59.240 --> 36:01.075
I already got a meeting Friday night.

36:01.576 --> 36:05.204
Seems this nasty fox, name of Trudy,
is looking for charter membership

36:05.288 --> 36:07.498
in the Theodore Carter Official Fan Club.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.212
How about you, Jack?
You backing out on the coalition too?

36:13.296 --> 36:16.007
JACK: Well, I kind of I promised my old
lady we'd go to a movie on Friday night.

36:16.090 --> 36:17.008
BOBBY: Oh, yeah?

36:17.091 --> 36:21.053
Ah, but what the hell?
I'll try and make it, okay?

36:21.137 --> 36:22.471
Conference room, 8:00.

36:24.557 --> 36:26.934
I know exactly
what you're going through, Bobby.

36:27.435 --> 36:31.147
I've faced similar resistance
as the assistant secretary general of WAD.

36:32.106 --> 36:34.859
-WAD?
-Women Against Discrimination.

36:35.610 --> 36:39.322
And now that you've been elected
the new vice president of the BOC,

36:39.697 --> 36:41.574
I guess you can say we're soul mates, huh?

36:42.909 --> 36:45.453
Yeah, I guess we could, Mrs. Furillo.

36:45.536 --> 36:48.748
Of course, our politics
are slightly different than the coalition.

36:48.831 --> 36:52.418
But in terms of political intent,
well, I don't have to tell you

36:52.501 --> 36:54.420
how much women and Blacks have in common.

36:55.922 --> 36:57.506
The thing I really wanted to say to you,
though, was

36:57.590 --> 37:01.010
I think it's absolutely wonderful
what you're doing for your people.

37:02.511 --> 37:04.639
-Thanks, Mrs. Furillo.
-Call me Fay.

37:06.307 --> 37:09.018
-Fay, it was nice talking to you.
-And believe me,

37:09.101 --> 37:10.770
if there was ever a place that needs you,

37:10.853 --> 37:13.356
it's this white, male-dominated dump.

37:13.606 --> 37:17.401
I mean, turn around and look. How many
Black or female faces do you see?

37:17.485 --> 37:18.736
-MAN: Right this way.
-WOMAN: Okay.

37:19.445 --> 37:21.280
-Come on. Right over here.
-Ease up, jack!

37:21.864 --> 37:24.909
-Not nearly enough.
-Right. Which is one of the reasons

37:24.992 --> 37:28.496
why we're staging our first sit-in
at Chief Daniels's office on Wednesday.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.957
-A sit-in? Chief Daniels's office?
-Right.

37:31.040 --> 37:34.293
Well, we're still in negotiations
with his top aide on quota hiring.

37:34.377 --> 37:38.547
But, uh, if all else fails, film at 11:00.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.759
Listen, whatever you do, don't tell Frank.

37:41.842 --> 37:43.678
He would absolutely kill me.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.554
Bobby, you know what we ought to do?

37:45.638 --> 37:47.682
We ought to get together for dinner
some night and rap.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.561
(chuckles) Yeah, I'd like that, Fay.

37:53.813 --> 37:54.647
Bobby!

37:55.147 --> 37:57.775
I'm not asking you for a date.
I just thought...

37:58.317 --> 38:00.820
we could have a really meaningful
interaction.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.366
-Recruiting drive, Fay?
-No, Frank.

38:05.449 --> 38:08.160
Actually, what I was doing is,
I came by to ask you

38:08.244 --> 38:10.538
if you can take Frank Jr.
on Wednesday evening.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.665
There's a good chance
I'm gonna be tied up.

38:12.748 --> 38:14.667
Uh, gee, I'm not sure.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.335
I-- I'll have to check my calendar.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.090
I mean it. Call me.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.223
(indistinct chattering)

38:38.232 --> 38:39.275
(siren wailing)

38:44.071 --> 38:45.823
I almost bought it out there, Bobby.

38:46.365 --> 38:50.161
If you weren't so wrapped up in playing
V.P. for that damn coalition of yours,

38:50.244 --> 38:51.620
none of this would've happened.

38:52.663 --> 38:53.664
What are you talking about?

38:53.748 --> 38:56.292
I'm talking
about eight inches of razor across my arm.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.711
I'm talking about 16 stitches
in County General.

38:58.794 --> 39:01.964
A foot more to the right, and they'd be
putting a sheet over me right about now.

39:02.298 --> 39:06.052
-Man, are you all right?
-Yeah. I'll live, no thanks to you.

39:07.219 --> 39:09.013
You know, I don't understand you, Bobby.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.307
For the life of me, I don't understand

39:11.390 --> 39:13.351
how some half-baked political gig

39:13.434 --> 39:15.478
could be more important to you
than your own partner.

39:16.020 --> 39:16.937
Come on, Renko.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.945
We've already been through this, Renko.

39:25.196 --> 39:28.783
You know the situation I'm in
with the coalition right now and all.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.410
Save it for the brothers, brother.

39:34.455 --> 39:37.833
There are some things
that I've committed myself to, Renko.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.837
And if you can't handle that,
then it's just too damn bad.

39:42.755 --> 39:46.258
Hey, I'll be back with you
out on the street in two lousy days.

39:47.843 --> 39:49.136
You sure about that, man?

39:50.304 --> 39:52.181
You're gettin' so one-tone lately,

39:52.640 --> 39:56.560
I was wondering if you might not prefer
a Black partner next time out.

39:58.854 --> 40:01.065
Hey, well, maybe that wouldn't be
such a bad idea!

40:08.864 --> 40:11.951
Tracy says that they're almost done
with the tests.

40:12.993 --> 40:15.371
-What happened to your arm?
-Line of duty, Pop.

40:16.664 --> 40:19.125
So you must be pretty happy
about getting out of here.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.584
What did they say, the doctors?

40:21.627 --> 40:22.837
Haven't said nothing yet.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.509
Well, do you need anything? Money?

40:29.760 --> 40:31.345
Union pays for everything.

40:32.221 --> 40:34.473
Worked my whole life for a hospital bed.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.976
(chuckles)
Don't say somethin' like that, Pop.

40:37.351 --> 40:39.687
You're gonna be okay. You'll see.
You're a strong old guy.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.571
You know, I, uh, I drove by the...

40:49.071 --> 40:51.949
old house on Dutch Street yesterday.

40:52.032 --> 40:54.577
Been a couple of years.
You know, they have a two-car garage

40:54.660 --> 40:56.370
where the old wishing well used to be.

40:57.830 --> 41:02.710
Then I sort of got to thinking about,
well, about Mama,

41:04.003 --> 41:05.129
and about the way that

41:05.463 --> 41:08.799
we all sort of lost each other
when she died.

41:10.759 --> 41:12.553
I got to thinking about those...

41:12.803 --> 41:15.055
barbecues we used to have
every Sunday afternoon.

41:15.139 --> 41:18.142
Remember that? You in that old apron
with those crossed chicken bones.

41:18.225 --> 41:19.059
Remember that?

41:19.685 --> 41:22.438
Oh, Pop, that was about the best house
a kid could grow up in.

41:23.689 --> 41:27.109
So me and Tracy, we were thinking
that we'd like to do it again,

41:27.318 --> 41:29.487
have a barbecue,
all of us together, this Sunday.

41:30.196 --> 41:33.115
-That sound good to you? This Sunday?
-That's fine.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.202
Uh, we could do it Saturday
if you want to.

41:36.619 --> 41:37.453
Fine.

41:38.537 --> 41:40.539
-Whatever day's good for you.
-I don't care.

41:40.623 --> 41:42.416
(chuckles) Come on, Pop.
Your kids want to see you.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.043
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

41:44.668 --> 41:45.711
-I remember--
-Remember?

41:47.671 --> 41:49.632
Remember who's the old man here.

41:50.716 --> 41:52.927
Barbecues always ended in a fight.

41:53.802 --> 41:58.432
I threw a ham at your mother once.
Nobody liked the barbecues. I hated 'em.

42:03.604 --> 42:05.022
Well, you're gonna come anyway.

42:06.315 --> 42:09.818
And there's gonna be
potato salad and coleslaw,

42:09.902 --> 42:13.072
and you're gonna sit at a table
and talk to your kids, damn it.

42:13.364 --> 42:17.576
This has been going on all my life.
I don't think you gave six smiles to me!

42:18.369 --> 42:21.455
Now, I know I didn't grow up
to be what you wanted.

42:22.039 --> 42:24.124
But you never did tell me what you wanted!

42:29.129 --> 42:30.506
It's time for my nap.

42:44.436 --> 42:45.312
I'm sorry, Daddy.

42:48.148 --> 42:49.108
I'm stupid.

42:51.277 --> 42:53.404
I gotta get my nap, Doctor says.

42:58.826 --> 42:59.994
(pounding)

43:01.620 --> 43:03.163
Hey, good buddy. Okay.

43:03.706 --> 43:05.916
-You wanna wire me for some AM/FM?
-He's drunk.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.418
-I'm ready.
-What'd you do?

43:07.960 --> 43:11.005
-That's it. I'm pulling the plug.
-No, man. We're set to go.

43:11.088 --> 43:14.008
Your partner, the trigger on this
operation, is falling on his face.

43:14.091 --> 43:17.886
-Hey, I'm ready. I'm here.
-Give me the wire. I'll do it.

43:17.970 --> 43:21.098
And get your head blown off?
Holland doesn't know you.

43:21.181 --> 43:22.141
He'll recognize the money!

43:22.224 --> 43:24.602
What are you guys trying to do?
I can handle this!

43:24.685 --> 43:26.562
Will you shut up, J.D., damn it! Shut up!

43:26.645 --> 43:28.856
Sanchez, stay off this line
till you hear from me. Understand?

43:30.065 --> 43:31.317
Let me do it, man. Let me do it, Captain.

43:31.400 --> 43:34.111
I can talk my way in.
I know the mentality. It's no big deal.

43:34.194 --> 43:35.529
-Yeah, no big deal.
-No, no big deal.

43:35.946 --> 43:37.156
Do you wanna be the cop
who missed the bust

43:37.239 --> 43:39.575
on a four-star dust lab
because of a lousy drunk here?

43:39.658 --> 43:40.826
Huh? Huh?

43:41.952 --> 43:44.580
You bring down LaRue, you bring down
yourself and everybody here.

43:44.663 --> 43:45.623
Man, listen...

43:46.749 --> 43:48.584
-All right, Neal. Put on a wire.
-Uh--

43:49.918 --> 43:51.754
(machinery whirring)

43:57.593 --> 44:00.596
-What do you want?
-Hey, man, John sent me.

44:01.013 --> 44:03.557
Got the money. Fifty grand.

44:04.516 --> 44:06.268
I don't know what you're talking about.

44:06.685 --> 44:10.773
The white dude's out. Politics, babe.
I'm the man now.

44:11.315 --> 44:13.776
-You think I'm stupid?
-That's your problem.

44:14.193 --> 44:16.320
I'm holding $50,000
that's gotta move tonight.

44:16.403 --> 44:19.156
And if you don't want it just say so,
and I'm gone, my man.

44:19.782 --> 44:21.950
-I don't want it.
-(clicks tongue) You got it.

44:22.951 --> 44:23.786
Hold it.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.542
You try anything and I'll kill ya.

44:40.052 --> 44:41.136
Straight ahead.

44:46.266 --> 44:47.851
(indistinct chattering)

44:48.644 --> 44:51.105
Lay the money down on the table.
We can have a count.

44:51.605 --> 44:53.482
Okay, my man.
Let me check out the stuff first.

44:53.565 --> 44:54.983
Right over this way.

44:55.067 --> 44:57.945
Straight ahead. You've got four boxes,

44:58.153 --> 45:00.239
12 bottles to the box.

45:00.906 --> 45:02.116
Yours. (grunts)

45:02.199 --> 45:03.951
-(groans)
-(glass shatters)

45:04.284 --> 45:07.621
Or maybe I'll just keep it, smart stuff,
and the money too.

45:13.085 --> 45:15.087
-Police officers! Open up!
-Police! Drop the gun!

45:17.923 --> 45:20.509
(clamoring)

45:25.305 --> 45:26.515
(static on police radio)

45:30.477 --> 45:32.438
-Listen, Captain...
-No, no, you listen.

45:32.730 --> 45:35.691
If you think I'm gonna stonewall
for that jerk, well, you're wrong.

45:37.860 --> 45:40.529
Neal. I-- I'm sorry, man.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.698
Look, I don't wanna see you
for a while, J.D.

45:44.408 --> 45:46.827
Hey, hey, hey, Neal. Come on.

45:56.879 --> 46:00.174
You can put this in your car.
The meeting is Friday, 8:00,

46:00.257 --> 46:02.050
at the main conference hall, Division.

46:02.134 --> 46:04.720
I've been watching you hit on all
the Uncle Chocolates around town,

46:04.803 --> 46:06.263
and doing a shuck on my types.

46:06.346 --> 46:08.891
So I just dropped by
to give you attitude you missed.

46:10.642 --> 46:11.602
I'll get back to you.

46:12.728 --> 46:14.855
You want to contribute
to the coalition, Vernon?

46:16.440 --> 46:19.860
Not really. See, I'm gonna split it
like a chicken, and you too.

46:20.235 --> 46:21.737
You know what a job action is?

46:21.820 --> 46:24.907
That's when the employees put on the skids
and do everything by the book.

46:24.990 --> 46:26.283
See, nothing gets done.

46:26.825 --> 46:29.870
Half the Black officers on this force
are ready to pull a job action

46:29.953 --> 46:32.456
if that's what we have to do
to get parity in this department.

46:32.539 --> 46:35.167
See, I'm gonna show you
what real power can do.

46:35.250 --> 46:37.169
Yeah, you're a power junkie,
aren't you, Vernon?

46:37.252 --> 46:38.378
Doesn't matter what the issues are,

46:38.462 --> 46:40.839
so long as you got somebody to jump
when you say so.

46:40.923 --> 46:44.593
The point is, my friend,
I have taken a personal dislike of you.

46:45.177 --> 46:48.806
You got no class, no brains,
you got no guts, and you got no soul.

46:49.515 --> 46:52.851
The worst kind of Black man is one
who dumps on his people, and that's you.

46:55.604 --> 46:59.107
All right, all right! All right.
Break this up. What's going on here?

47:03.153 --> 47:03.987
Nothin'.

47:05.572 --> 47:06.990
WOMAN (on TV):
<i>Wilbur Harmon was released today</i>

47:07.074 --> 47:11.245
<i>on what the district attorney's office</i>
<i>is calling a "procedural impropriety."</i>

47:11.453 --> 47:14.081
<i>Details of the impropriety</i>
<i>were not disclosed.</i>

47:14.623 --> 47:16.333
<i>Harmon was arrested last Tuesday</i>

47:16.416 --> 47:19.461
<i>in connection with the shooting death</i>
<i>of attorney Pamela Gilliam...</i>

47:19.545 --> 47:20.838
-Are you going to watch him?
<i>-...and was being held</i>

47:20.921 --> 47:22.381
<i>in County Correctional Facility</i>

47:22.464 --> 47:24.925
<i>for four days pending arraignment</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

47:27.344 --> 47:28.595
We don't have the people.

47:32.975 --> 47:36.270
I guess the thing to do now
is just put it out of my mind.

47:36.687 --> 47:39.356
You can drive yourself crazy
thinking about these things.

47:39.940 --> 47:42.776
Joyce, sooner or later
these guys slip up. You know that.

47:45.487 --> 47:48.615
You mean we'll get him
when he kills someone else, maybe.

47:49.116 --> 47:50.659
CALLETANO: Frank, they are back.

47:51.994 --> 47:53.120
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

47:56.582 --> 47:58.667
(indistinct chatter)

48:02.713 --> 48:04.423
-Jerry.
-All done, Frank.

48:04.923 --> 48:08.051
Half a ton of chemicals and equipment,
and, uh, some guns too.

48:08.343 --> 48:09.219
Any problems?

48:13.098 --> 48:14.808
FUCHS: Textbook operation. In and out.

48:17.144 --> 48:19.479
-Good work, Neal.
-Thanks, Captain.

48:23.442 --> 48:25.903
You, especially, J.D. Congratulations.

48:26.528 --> 48:28.113
Just stealing my paycheck, Captain.

48:41.543 --> 48:44.546
(closing theme playing)
