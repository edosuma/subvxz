WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:07.417
Yes!

00:14.625 --> 00:17.167
I've gathered you for a mission
of utmost importance,

00:17.250 --> 00:21.375
so vital that the future of the academy
relies on nothing short

00:21.458 --> 00:23.708
of absolute success.

00:23.792 --> 00:26.917
I hope it's Arkeyan robots.
I hate those things.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.958
-Nah, Drow Elves.
-Robots!

00:29.042 --> 00:31.292
-Drow Elves. Elves! Elves!
-Robots! Robots!

00:31.375 --> 00:32.542
Sheep!

00:33.583 --> 00:35.167
Well, I hope it's Kaos.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.417
I still have frost in my ears
from when he tried to freeze us.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.875
No, Skylanders,
this time your foe is different,

00:40.958 --> 00:42.708
but no less formidable.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.417
It is the basement pipes.

00:46.083 --> 00:49.708
They are being attacked by
a vicious clog of beard hair. Not mine.

00:49.792 --> 00:53.125
-Uh, we're unclogging pipes?
-Yes.

00:53.208 --> 00:56.750
Before they explode and the basement
is fraught with minor flooding,

00:56.833 --> 00:59.333
resulting in a dastardly plumbing bill!

01:00.417 --> 01:03.333
What are you waiting for?
Hurry, Skylanders!

01:03.417 --> 01:05.833
You heard the man.
Up on your feet, people!

01:05.917 --> 01:07.667
We've got plum-bing to do.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.042
Hmm. Plum-bing.
Is that right?

01:10.125 --> 01:11.750
I know there's a "B" in there.
Anyway...

01:11.833 --> 01:12.958
Go, go, go!

01:13.875 --> 01:16.792
What's the matter, Spyro?
Are you too good to clean some pipes?

01:16.875 --> 01:19.625
What? No, I'm not too good
to clean. It's just...

01:19.708 --> 01:21.083
It's just that after battling Kaos

01:21.167 --> 01:23.083
and all the other threats
that threaten the Skylands,

01:23.167 --> 01:26.000
this kind of mission
seems a little... basic?

01:26.083 --> 01:27.792
Well, being a Skylander doesn't just mean

01:27.875 --> 01:30.375
fighting bad guys
every second of every day.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.958
We provide many essential services
to Skylands, great and small.

01:34.042 --> 01:36.958
And sometimes that means
money-saving plum-bing missions.

01:37.042 --> 01:38.375
That still sounds weird.

01:38.458 --> 01:40.125
Yeah, 'cause it's a soft "B," Jet-Vac.

01:40.208 --> 01:43.333
It's "plum-ming."
You don't say the "B."

01:43.417 --> 01:45.458
It's... it's not a crum-buh.
It's a crumb.

01:45.542 --> 01:47.208
And it's fine.
I get your point.

01:47.292 --> 01:48.542
You better get it,

01:48.625 --> 01:51.500
because it's high time you learned
to do things the Skylander way!

01:51.583 --> 01:54.917
So... is this the Skylander way, huh?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.583
Also, did you have a mouse for breakfast?

01:56.667 --> 01:58.792
Do you have any idea
how pungent those things are?

01:58.875 --> 02:00.667
They... they smell worse
on the way out, by the way.

02:00.750 --> 02:02.083
Move!

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.292 --> 02:34.083
Okay, what we have here

02:34.167 --> 02:35.792
is a category eight clog.

02:35.875 --> 02:39.375
Haven't seen one of these since
the Great Back Hair Crisis of ought-six.

02:39.458 --> 02:44.042
If this thing blows, all the academy's
plumbing will be disabled for hours!

02:44.125 --> 02:47.000
Maybe even a whole day.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.292
No! Not a whole day!

02:49.375 --> 02:51.792
I know, Pop.
It's the stuff of nightmares.

02:51.875 --> 02:54.417
Now, we need a meticulous approach, team.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.000
-A foolproof plan of attack.
-Oh, awesome.

02:57.083 --> 02:58.292
So, what is it, Jet-Vac?

02:58.375 --> 03:01.167
I'll tell you... as soon as I think of it.

03:01.250 --> 03:02.792
Uh, JV, all due respect,

03:02.875 --> 03:04.875
but I... I don't think we have
much time to think this through.

03:04.958 --> 03:05.958
As opposed to what?

03:06.042 --> 03:09.417
Acting first, then letting the chips fall
where they may? Uh-uh.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.125
Skylanders do not fly off...

03:11.208 --> 03:13.000
...all willy-nilly, and neither will you.

03:13.083 --> 03:16.250
You do things the right way now,
the Skylander way.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.417
But that pipe is about to unleash
a knee-high nightmare

03:18.500 --> 03:20.500
for anyone who can't fly.
That's all of you.

03:20.583 --> 03:22.042
So, we need to act fast.

03:22.125 --> 03:24.958
We'll act fast when I have
a proper plan in place.

03:25.042 --> 03:26.667
Which I'd have already
if you weren't interrupting me.

03:26.750 --> 03:28.292
Guys, this is about to get ugly.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.875
Oh, you ain't kiddin'.
That pipe's ready to blow.

03:30.958 --> 03:33.667
I could make some sort of potion
that would dissolve the clog!

03:33.750 --> 03:36.167
There's no time.
One of us, with fire breath, ideally,

03:36.250 --> 03:38.458
should fly to the end of the pipe,
open it, blast fire in,

03:38.542 --> 03:41.583
and... and incinerate the clog.
Right, I should do it.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.625
So, if I suctioned one end
of the pipe...

03:43.708 --> 03:44.792
How do you think Spyro's doing?

03:46.083 --> 03:48.875
You shall not pass!

03:52.875 --> 03:55.625
Elf could then insert her swords,
the tips of which were soaked

03:55.708 --> 03:57.250
with a disappearing potion made by Pop...

03:57.333 --> 03:59.625
Inconvenience averted.

03:59.708 --> 04:02.625
The clog worked itself out?
That would've been a good plan.

04:02.708 --> 04:06.208
Actually, I took care of it, Jet-Vac.
Nothing a ball of fire couldn't handle.

04:06.292 --> 04:09.292
You acted alone?
I told you we needed a plan!

04:09.375 --> 04:10.625
We did, my plan.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.750
It's the one I thought of while
you were considering your plans.

04:12.833 --> 04:14.208
Which, I'm sure would've worked, too.

04:14.292 --> 04:17.791
So, crisis averted before 11:00.
Brunch, anyone?

04:20.583 --> 04:22.250
Glumshanks! Where are you?

04:22.333 --> 04:24.250
It's nearly time for my presentation.

04:24.333 --> 04:28.375
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold up.
You call these donuts?

04:28.458 --> 04:30.542
Sir, please, just this once!

04:30.625 --> 04:33.542
Genevieve at the patisserie
is capable of so much more.

04:33.625 --> 04:36.292
Now these delights are Napoleons
with a thin layer of ganache--

04:36.375 --> 04:39.750
Oh, yeah?
Well, they look like ear plugs to me.

04:39.833 --> 04:42.042
Kaos! Are you down there?

04:42.125 --> 04:44.875
Indeed, I am, Mother.
But you never come to my lair.

04:44.958 --> 04:46.625
To what do I owe the pleasure?

04:46.708 --> 04:49.083
This place is the exact opposite
of pleasure.

04:49.167 --> 04:52.083
It still smells the same as it did
when it was the castle's outhouse.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.667
Good one, Mother.

04:53.750 --> 04:54.958
You're such a card.

04:55.042 --> 04:56.542
Do you see me laughing?

04:56.625 --> 04:58.917
Seriously, what do you think
that is over there? A Ming vase?

05:00.250 --> 05:02.333
Now, I don't want to spend any more time
down here than I have to,

05:02.417 --> 05:04.167
so let me just say what I have to, and--

05:04.250 --> 05:06.000
Actually, Mother, you are the reason

05:06.083 --> 05:08.667
I'm putting together
this little presentation.

05:08.750 --> 05:12.750
I want to show you my new scheme
to destroy the Skylanders.

05:12.833 --> 05:14.417
Behold!

05:15.333 --> 05:16.750
Wait. What's happening?

05:16.833 --> 05:19.208
Why isn't my astral projection
power working?

05:20.875 --> 05:23.458
- It's malfunctioning!
- What's not working?

05:23.542 --> 05:27.792
I copied a map to the Core of Light that
I found locked away at Skylanders Academy.

05:27.875 --> 05:29.667
But now it won't project out.

05:29.750 --> 05:31.583
Why isn't my head working?

05:31.667 --> 05:33.833
A question I've asked myself
since you were a small boy.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.875
- What was that, Glumshanks?
- Nothing, sir.

05:35.958 --> 05:37.458
But, uh,
I would like to say for the record

05:37.542 --> 05:40.625
that I did warn you that continuing to
splash around in the bath like a toddler

05:40.708 --> 05:43.083
could short out
your head's projection power,

05:43.167 --> 05:44.750
and it looks like, yet again, I was right.

05:44.833 --> 05:47.708
Uh, listen, you can get back to
your dumb ideas that will never work,

05:47.792 --> 05:50.083
just as soon as you get a real job
and start paying rent.

05:50.167 --> 05:51.167
Like, today.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.458
Or I'm kicking you out.

05:52.542 --> 05:55.500
Yeah, that's what I came down here
to tell you. Have a great day!

05:55.583 --> 05:58.375
But, Mother, I can't get a job.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.667
I need to dedicate all of my time
and energy into getting that map

06:01.750 --> 06:04.542
and unleashing eternal darkness
across the Skylands!

06:04.625 --> 06:07.625
Unleashing eternal darkness
doesn't pay the rent.

06:07.708 --> 06:10.458
And neither have you since I let you
start living here in the guest castle.

06:10.542 --> 06:12.417
Now let go of my robe!

06:12.500 --> 06:13.792
And you! Come with me.

06:13.875 --> 06:16.167
I've got bidding piling up
and you're the troll to do it.

06:16.250 --> 06:19.667
Don't worry, Glummy.
I'll fix this as soon as I can,

06:19.750 --> 06:22.917
so I can get back to destroying
the Skylanders and harassing you.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.208
Oh, uh, no rush, sir.

06:24.292 --> 06:26.917
I'll find a way to survive
in your absence...

06:27.000 --> 06:28.333
somehow.

06:30.750 --> 06:33.667
So, Jet-Vac was being
a little tough on you today, huh?

06:33.750 --> 06:37.125
I'm sure it's just that there's a lot he
wants to teach us about being Skylanders,

06:37.208 --> 06:39.208
and Jet-Vac's got his way of doing that.

06:39.292 --> 06:41.917
The important thing is
I saved the world today.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.458
Uh, you unclogged a pipe, dude.

06:44.542 --> 06:47.583
You say "potato,"
I say, "You're welcome."

06:47.667 --> 06:50.375
Anyway, I'm sure JV will relax

06:50.458 --> 06:53.208
once he sees my way of doing things
can be effective, too.

06:55.292 --> 06:56.458
What are you doing here?

06:56.542 --> 06:59.042
Hold on.
Did I just conjure you from thin air

06:59.125 --> 07:01.417
-just by thinking about you?
-Negative-o, rookie.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.167
I'm here because you went rogue
on that pipe today.

07:04.250 --> 07:07.167
Your rebellious, impulsive nature
needs to be tamed,

07:07.250 --> 07:09.292
and I'm just the bird to do it.

07:09.375 --> 07:11.000
Sure, yeah.
Great. Good.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.500
What, uh,
what do you got there?

07:13.583 --> 07:15.333
That's...
that's not a suitcase, is it?

07:15.417 --> 07:17.250
-Please don't say it's a--
-It's a suitcase!

07:17.333 --> 07:20.500
And I'm moving in
until we get you straightened out.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.583
So, where do I sleep, roomie?

07:22.667 --> 07:24.292
Uh...

07:25.083 --> 07:28.500
Uh, that's my room there.
This is Eruptor's room.

07:29.625 --> 07:31.542
And here's the bathroom, obviously.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.708
Oh! There it is.

07:33.792 --> 07:35.500
And over there is Spyro's room.

07:35.583 --> 07:36.875
Spyro's room, eh?

07:36.958 --> 07:39.167
Well, let's get a good look at that,
shall we?

07:40.542 --> 07:43.750
Whoa, whoa, time out.
You can't just barge into my room.

07:43.833 --> 07:45.208
Of course I can barge in here.

07:45.292 --> 07:46.875
I'm one of the senior members
of this team,

07:46.958 --> 07:49.625
which means I can do random spot checks
of a junior member's room

07:49.708 --> 07:52.000
to make sure it's in tip-top shape
at any time I want.

07:52.083 --> 07:55.125
Like right now!
And what a dump this is.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.792
Why, thank you! Oh, wait, wait, wait.
What'd you say? Dump?

07:57.875 --> 08:00.042
I call 'em like I see 'em, Spyro.

08:00.125 --> 08:03.625
No wonder you don't play by the rules,
you're disorganized.

08:03.708 --> 08:06.083
- What? Disorganized?
- My room is perfect.

08:06.167 --> 08:08.042
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about this?

08:08.125 --> 08:10.458
My... my bed? What about it?

08:10.542 --> 08:12.875
Oh. Oh, wow.

08:12.958 --> 08:14.708
Oh, wow, what?

08:14.792 --> 08:15.792
Horrible box springs.

08:15.875 --> 08:19.458
Significant sag.
Sag equals poor spinal alignment.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.458
Poor alignment equals a poor attitude.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.125
A poor attitude equals poor Skylandering.

08:24.208 --> 08:26.042
And this. Video games?

08:26.125 --> 08:29.875
These things make you lazy.
Not the Skylander way.

08:29.958 --> 08:31.750
Actually, sir,
multiple studies have confirmed

08:31.833 --> 08:34.082
that playing video games
improves hand-eye coordination,

08:34.167 --> 08:35.167
promotes goal setting, and helps--

08:36.667 --> 08:38.250
-Uh...
-Well, now that we've assessed

08:38.332 --> 08:40.500
your personal space,
let's go down to the kitchen

08:40.582 --> 08:42.957
and criticize your awful eating habits.

08:44.125 --> 08:45.792
Hello,
Skylands Employment Agency.

08:45.875 --> 08:50.333
Hey, uh, how far back did you list
your experience on your application?

08:50.417 --> 08:52.083
Three hundred years? Four?

08:52.167 --> 08:56.417
-Kay-ooze?
-It's "Kay-os!" And that is I.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.583
Great.

08:57.667 --> 09:00.250
Yeah, I see you have listed under "skills"

09:00.333 --> 09:02.458
that you have an advanced knowledge
of plotting and scheming,

09:02.542 --> 09:04.708
and you also worked part-time
at a movie theater.

09:04.792 --> 09:08.083
-For pocket money, yes.
-Mmm-hmm, yeah. And since then?

09:08.167 --> 09:10.542
Ooh, I've stayed plenty busy
trying to annihilate all Skylanders.

09:10.625 --> 09:12.625
Mmm-hmm, and where do you
see yourself in five years?

09:12.708 --> 09:14.583
Ruling the Skylands as
supreme overlord of darkness

09:14.667 --> 09:15.917
and destroying anyone who gets in my way.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.417
Mmm-hmm, right.
"Ruling and destroying."

09:18.500 --> 09:21.958
Uh, Mr. Kaos, I think I have
the perfect position for you.

09:22.042 --> 09:23.625
Congratulations.

09:23.708 --> 09:27.958
You're the new corporate mascot
of Uncle Merle's Lizard Gizzards.

09:28.042 --> 09:29.042
Now, here's your arrow.

09:29.125 --> 09:30.917
I'll be back to check on you in 12 hours

09:31.000 --> 09:33.625
so you can take your
legally-required ten-minute break.

09:36.875 --> 09:40.542
Hello. I'm a gizzard.
Eat me.

09:49.333 --> 09:52.500
Whoa! The rhythmic rotation
of the flipping arrow

09:52.583 --> 09:56.333
has me hypnotized beyond the capacity
for independent thought.

09:56.417 --> 10:01.500
Really? Well, then...
go eat a gizzard or something.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.125
I would like a gizzard.

10:04.208 --> 10:06.083
I would like a whole bucket of gizzards.

10:06.167 --> 10:07.167
Then get out of here!

10:09.583 --> 10:10.792
Hello?

10:10.875 --> 10:13.958
Hello? Oh, sorry, mister, uh, uh...

10:14.042 --> 10:16.375
what are you exactly?
Some kind of discarded organ meat?

10:16.458 --> 10:18.750
-Like a spleen or something?
-It's me, Glumshanks!

10:18.833 --> 10:20.625
I'm dressed as a gizzard.

10:20.708 --> 10:23.208
This is my new job.
It's horrible.

10:23.292 --> 10:25.750
As the Uncle Merle Lizard Gizzard!

10:25.833 --> 10:29.083
Bravo, sir. Now that's the way
to expand your culinary horizons.

10:29.167 --> 10:31.958
You know, offal has been used for
hundreds of years in peasant food--

10:32.042 --> 10:33.542
Why are you calling, you idiot?

10:33.625 --> 10:36.083
Oh, uh, just checking, sir,

10:36.167 --> 10:38.625
but what... what time do you think
you'll be coming home?

10:38.708 --> 10:40.750
I have no idea. Why?

10:40.833 --> 10:44.458
Oh, it's just that things
are so horrible back here.

10:44.542 --> 10:47.917
Truly demeaning.
Your mother is such a monster.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.250
Oh, Glummy, be strong!

10:50.333 --> 10:52.958
Just try and go
to the happy place in your mind.

10:53.042 --> 10:56.042
You know, your memories
of all the fun we have together.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.833
Like when you clipped my toenails.

10:57.917 --> 11:00.667
And I'll be back as soon as I can.

11:00.750 --> 11:03.083
Looks like we have a few more hours
to catch up, ma'am.

11:03.167 --> 11:04.625
Delightful!

11:04.708 --> 11:07.833
So tell me more about your days
in the theater before we met.

11:07.917 --> 11:11.542
Ah, yes, well,
the stage truly was my first love.

11:11.625 --> 11:15.083
But then I found myself in a rut doing
a lot of outdoor community productions.

11:15.167 --> 11:17.083
So much Shakespeare.

11:17.167 --> 11:20.583
Roger kept asking me to play Falstaff
over and over again...

11:20.667 --> 11:24.625
Hang on. If Glumshanks couldn't
recognize me in this getup,

11:24.708 --> 11:27.083
that means no one else will either.

11:27.167 --> 11:31.625
And that gives me a brilliantly evil idea.

11:31.708 --> 11:33.750
So, you haven't
seen Spyro lately, either?

11:33.833 --> 11:38.875
Not since Jet-Vac made him run 20 miles
to sweat out his rebellious toxins.

11:38.958 --> 11:40.625
Psst. Guys!
Guys, I'm down here.

11:40.708 --> 11:44.208
-Spyro? What are you doing?
-Hiding from that drill sergeant, Jet-Vac.

11:44.292 --> 11:47.583
He's driving me crazy!
He won't give me any personal space.

11:47.667 --> 11:50.625
So, the plan is you're going to live
in the sewer. Forever.

11:50.708 --> 11:53.542
Well, I was just going to hide
in the sewer until Jet-Vac retired,

11:53.625 --> 11:55.792
but I think I like your idea better.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.583
Seriously, how old do you guys
think he is, huh?

11:57.667 --> 11:59.000
He seems elderly, right?

11:59.083 --> 12:01.708
I overheard him say
"whippersnapper" non-ironically...

12:01.792 --> 12:05.667
Skylanders unite!
Falling Forest is on fire! Hurry!

12:05.750 --> 12:07.792
You heard the head.
Let's go!

12:16.167 --> 12:17.917
All right, we need to act fast!

12:18.000 --> 12:19.792
Awesome!
What's the plan, JV?

12:19.875 --> 12:23.417
First thing we have to do,
read our vehicle instruction manuals.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.083
What?

12:25.167 --> 12:26.583
Jet-Vac, shouldn't we just wing it

12:26.667 --> 12:28.750
so we can save the Falling Forest
before it burns down?

12:28.833 --> 12:31.125
Winging it is not the Skylander way.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.083
Knowing exactly what to do is.

12:33.167 --> 12:36.292
And that starts with being able
to fully operate our SuperChargers.

12:36.375 --> 12:37.750
Page one.

12:37.833 --> 12:40.708
"You are now the owner
of a SuperCharger."

12:43.833 --> 12:46.292
Yes! My favorite stations are preset.

12:46.375 --> 12:49.208
"Bluetooth not paired"?

12:49.292 --> 12:52.500
Why is this so hard every single time?

12:52.583 --> 12:54.375
And done!

12:54.458 --> 12:57.083
All right, Skylanders,
let's go and save the--

12:58.333 --> 13:00.750
By Jove.
Fellas, where's the fire?

13:00.833 --> 13:03.042
Oh, right.
Yes, of course. In the forest.

13:08.375 --> 13:12.000
Spyro, why are you stopping?
We need to get to the Falling Forest.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.750
Dude, this is the Falling Forest,
but it's not on fire.

13:14.833 --> 13:16.708
Yeah, because we put it out.

13:16.792 --> 13:19.667
You guys
were taking so long to get here,

13:19.750 --> 13:22.542
that the trolls who live in the forest
called for backup.

13:22.625 --> 13:26.958
Bingo! And far be it from us
to do the job for you, but...

13:27.042 --> 13:28.833
well, someone had to.

13:28.917 --> 13:29.958
Our team for the win!

13:31.292 --> 13:34.875
So, how'd you get held up?
Fight with Kaos on the way here?

13:34.958 --> 13:36.375
Show down with the Doom Raiders?

13:36.458 --> 13:38.708
Sneak attack on the academy?

13:38.792 --> 13:41.458
Have you guys
ever read one of these things?

13:41.542 --> 13:44.708
Such a wealth of knowledge
and entertainment.

13:44.792 --> 13:46.167
Am I right?

13:50.833 --> 13:54.625
So, Jet-Vac,
what happened at the Falling Forest today?

13:54.708 --> 13:58.375
Turns out, nothing. Per your request,
it was saved from burning to the ground,

13:58.458 --> 14:01.417
-by Ka-Boom and Snap Shot.
-Right.

14:01.500 --> 14:05.375
And why was it that they had to do the job
of the core Skylander team?

14:05.458 --> 14:08.125
We got there as fast
as the SuperChargers could go, Eon.

14:08.208 --> 14:10.667
It took you three hours to get there.

14:10.750 --> 14:15.667
Which I heard is also how long it took you
to read your vehicle's operation manual.

14:15.750 --> 14:19.417
Did it? Huh. Didn't feel that long.
It was a real page-turner.

14:19.500 --> 14:23.375
All righty then,
now back to the task at hand, lunch.

14:23.458 --> 14:27.958
Do I start with the business end of the
gizzard and work my way out to the crust?

14:28.042 --> 14:29.875
Or go crust first,

14:29.958 --> 14:31.667
then to the gooey, unidentifiable middle?

14:31.750 --> 14:34.000
You need a plan to eat, Jet-Vac?

14:34.083 --> 14:36.333
Hold that thought, Hugo.
Be right with you after I figure out

14:36.417 --> 14:39.792
how to properly gobble this thing down.
Don't worry, it'll come to me...

14:39.875 --> 14:41.500
-Hey!
-Didn't see that coming, did you?

14:41.583 --> 14:44.292
And now I have your food.
You know why?

14:44.375 --> 14:46.958
Because I didn't plan it, I just did it!

14:47.042 --> 14:48.208
What are you getting at, sir?

14:48.292 --> 14:50.833
I was successful
because I acted on my impulse.

14:50.917 --> 14:54.583
Which is what certain other members
of this team do on occasion with success.

14:54.667 --> 14:59.292
Maybe if you had acted first
instead of always being so regimented,

14:59.375 --> 15:04.292
I wouldn't be stuck explaining why the
Skylanders almost failed to do their job.

15:05.458 --> 15:06.708
You're right, Eon.

15:06.792 --> 15:08.583
Guess I've been riding
Spyro's tail pretty hard.

15:08.667 --> 15:12.958
A true Skylander trusts their instincts
as much as their training, Jet-Vac.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.042
Spyro does this very well.

15:15.125 --> 15:16.667
Give him a chance to show you.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.667
You and the team
will be better off for it.

15:18.750 --> 15:22.000
I'm going to go find him and apologize
for the way I've been acting.

15:22.083 --> 15:25.042
And, now,
I'm going to trust my gut instinct

15:25.125 --> 15:27.667
and leave this place and never return.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.500
See you back at the academy, Hugo.

15:30.833 --> 15:32.333
Hello, Master Eon's assistant.

15:32.417 --> 15:35.667
-Enjoying your gizzard?
-Well, I was just about to dig in, so--

15:35.750 --> 15:37.000
Nobody cares! Peep this!

15:38.083 --> 15:40.875
Wow, cool arrow!

15:40.958 --> 15:42.917
Now I want a gizzard.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.792
I know where you can have
all the gizzards you can choke down.

15:45.875 --> 15:46.875
Where?

15:46.958 --> 15:49.333
Inside the double-secret relics vault
at the Grand Library.

15:49.417 --> 15:51.042
We should totally go there right now,

15:51.125 --> 15:53.625
because I need to get back
inside that room and get my hands

15:53.708 --> 15:55.708
-on the map to the Core of Light.
-Right.

15:55.792 --> 15:58.542
That sounds like a swell idea.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.958
Let's go there now.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.458
Excellent. After you.

16:04.042 --> 16:05.875
Hey, Spyro.
What are you up to, then?

16:05.958 --> 16:08.875
Oh, just sitting here
and reading about how to be a hero.

16:08.958 --> 16:12.083
'Cause if there's one thing you taught me,
I can't do anything right

16:12.167 --> 16:14.917
unless I do it
according to some book first.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.750
It's just that your act-first,
think-later nature makes me nervous.

16:18.833 --> 16:22.375
Now, I've seen that kind of behavior
burn way too many Skylanders.

16:22.458 --> 16:24.167
What... what do you mean?

16:24.250 --> 16:26.583
Oh, I was just like you once, son.

16:26.667 --> 16:27.833
Talented, cocky,

16:27.917 --> 16:31.000
-dumber than all my teammates.
-Wait, who said I'm dumb?

16:31.083 --> 16:34.542
I used to rush into action
without a plan every time, too.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.708
I didn't worry about the rules.

16:36.792 --> 16:39.667
But then, I lost something
that meant the world to me.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.833
-Your wings.
-Wings? What?

16:41.917 --> 16:45.750
No, no, no, I sacrificed those
in an epic moment of heroism.

16:45.833 --> 16:49.500
There was a widow,
an orphanage, a huge fire.

16:49.583 --> 16:51.917
They even wrote a song about it.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.542
Look, I just want you to know,

16:53.625 --> 16:56.500
I went too far with the whole
"Skylander way" thing.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.292
I was trying to protect you and the others

16:58.375 --> 17:00.500
from the same youthful mistakes
I once made.

17:00.583 --> 17:03.417
But, well, I now know that I just need
to let you be yourselves.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.291
So, Eon talked to you?

17:05.375 --> 17:07.333
-Pretty much.
-Thanks, JV.

17:07.416 --> 17:08.791
I know I don't have a great track record

17:08.875 --> 17:10.916
of doing things the "right way."

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
But I...

17:12.083 --> 17:14.708
I think you'll find
that my way can be effective, too.

17:14.791 --> 17:15.791
You ought to try it sometime.

17:15.875 --> 17:18.916
Maybe I will, but I probably won't.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.125
- Should we hug or something?
- Don't make it weird, lad.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.750
That's it. Lizard gizzards galore,

17:24.833 --> 17:29.083
and the map to the Core of Light,
are just inside that bookshelf, dummy.

17:29.167 --> 17:30.958
-Now get me in there.
-Sure.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.792
Yo, Lizard Gizzard guy!

17:36.458 --> 17:38.958
Hey, Gizzard Man,
hook us up with some coupons, huh?

17:39.042 --> 17:41.125
Guess you didn't realize
there were Skylanders here.

17:41.208 --> 17:42.208
Honest mistake.

17:42.292 --> 17:46.292
Well, not that honest since you are inside
Skylander Academy.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.167
Not sure who you thought would be here,

17:48.250 --> 17:49.875
but anywho,
you can totally make up for it

17:49.958 --> 17:52.792
by just giving us, the Skylanders,
free stuff. Come on.

17:52.875 --> 17:55.292
Also, if you need a face for endorsements,
look no further.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.875
Yes, no. Uh, sorry, fresh out
of coupons. Next time! Now, off you go.

17:58.958 --> 18:02.125
Okay, fine, but before we leave you
totally alone with hypnotized Hugo

18:02.208 --> 18:04.750
so you can go into the Relics Room
and do whatever you want,

18:04.833 --> 18:06.167
do the Lizard Gizzard dance, huh?

18:06.250 --> 18:07.500
Yeah! Do it!

18:07.583 --> 18:09.583
Sorry, I...
My knee is acting up.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.583
Old musical theater injury, you see?

18:11.667 --> 18:13.250
Five, six, seven, eight, ow!

18:13.333 --> 18:14.958
Oh, come on.
Just do the one move.

18:15.042 --> 18:16.708
Yeah, the move you made famous.

18:16.792 --> 18:18.708
Do it! Do it!

18:18.792 --> 18:20.958
- Do it!
- Cram it in your cram holes!

18:21.042 --> 18:24.833
I am not doing
the stupid Lizard Gizzard dance!

18:24.917 --> 18:29.292
And I want the map to the Core of Light!

18:29.375 --> 18:31.167
Kaos?

18:31.250 --> 18:32.583
Would you believe no?

18:32.667 --> 18:34.333
Wow.

18:34.417 --> 18:37.625
Did you seriously think that Master Eon
was gonna leave that map

18:37.708 --> 18:39.625
inside the Relics Room
after you found it in there?

18:39.708 --> 18:41.375
It... it made sense in my head,

18:41.458 --> 18:44.917
but now that I'm hearing
the words out loud... Gotta go!

18:46.583 --> 18:50.917
Whoa, JV, did you just trip Kaos
without planning it?

18:51.000 --> 18:54.958
-I... I think I did! That felt good!
-Right?

18:56.333 --> 18:58.583
Now, how should we handle
this trespassing twerp?

18:58.667 --> 19:00.000
Don't think.
Just do.

19:00.083 --> 19:03.292
And do it fast!
Uh, there's worms on your breath.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.417
-Reek.
-Why, you...

19:09.167 --> 19:11.250
Congrats, guys.

19:11.333 --> 19:14.667
You worked out your issues
and defeated Kaos.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.458
Yep, we made real progress today.

19:16.542 --> 19:20.083
And I even followed every order
Jet-Vac gave during the fight.

19:20.167 --> 19:23.625
And I made a few impulsive moves
of my own.

19:23.708 --> 19:26.458
Remember when I kicked Kaos
instead of punching him?

19:26.542 --> 19:28.792
Oh, yeah, that was...

19:28.875 --> 19:30.333
You... you really went off-script there.

19:31.125 --> 19:32.125
So what happened to Kaos?

19:32.208 --> 19:34.625
Unfortunately, he was able to
get away after bombarding us

19:34.708 --> 19:37.292
with the lizard gizzards
he was carrying around inside his costume.

19:37.375 --> 19:40.292
Ew, he was carting around lizard guts?

19:40.375 --> 19:41.917
Weaponized lizard guts, pal.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.083
Gizzards to the face.

19:44.167 --> 19:46.000
Some in the eyes.
A little got in our mouths.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.417
I may never
get that smell out of my nostrils.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.125
Well, lad, onward we go.

19:50.208 --> 19:52.417
Since I don't need to
ride your rear anymore

19:52.500 --> 19:56.083
about doing things the Skylander way,
I should probably move out.

19:56.167 --> 19:57.542
You know what, though?

19:57.625 --> 20:00.625
You've already built your nest
in the attic. Why don't you just stay?

20:00.708 --> 20:02.167
-Right, guys?
-Yeah, sounds great!

20:02.250 --> 20:03.583
We have an attic?

20:03.667 --> 20:04.792
What up, dudes?

20:04.875 --> 20:06.083
Uh, Professor Pop,

20:06.167 --> 20:08.250
have you been in the basement
this whole time?

20:08.333 --> 20:10.750
Duh! That's where my laboratory is,

20:10.833 --> 20:12.833
and my bed, and all my other stuff.

20:12.917 --> 20:16.292
How long have you been squatting,
uh, living in the basement?

20:16.375 --> 20:19.750
I don't know.
What year is it again?

20:19.833 --> 20:22.417
Anyway, later!

20:24.333 --> 20:28.333
Ah, I never expected that
after your Sicilian Opening.

20:28.417 --> 20:29.833
Well played, madame.

20:29.917 --> 20:31.792
- Mother!
- He's back.

20:32.333 --> 20:33.500
Quick! Sit on me!

20:33.583 --> 20:35.250
Mother, I did what you asked.

20:35.333 --> 20:36.583
I got a real job.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.750
I worked all day, and I got pummeled
instead of a pay check.

20:39.833 --> 20:43.083
-Now, I hope you're satisfied.
-You got beat up while wearing that?

20:43.167 --> 20:44.917
Yep, totally satisfied.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.333
Does this mean
I can stay here in the guest castle?

20:48.417 --> 20:50.917
I just wanted you
to get out of the house for one day

20:51.000 --> 20:54.417
instead of wasting your time on
ridiculous plots to defeat the Skylanders.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.250
Be a productive member of society,

20:56.333 --> 20:59.417
instead of a guy who basically still lives
at home in his mom's basement.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.417
Well, Mother, when you put it like that,

21:01.500 --> 21:04.083
it's way more fun hanging out here
and plotting evil,

21:04.167 --> 21:06.208
so I choose this!

21:06.292 --> 21:07.708
Of course you do.

21:07.792 --> 21:09.417
At least I tried.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.333
You can have your troll back now, too.

21:11.417 --> 21:13.000
Oh, and Falstaff?

21:13.083 --> 21:16.083
That requires about as much
dramatic range as a potted plant.

21:16.167 --> 21:19.250
What, you're too much of a wimp
to take on Richard III?

21:19.333 --> 21:20.375
Man up!

21:20.458 --> 21:23.208
So she was mocking
your theater days again, huh, Glummy?

21:23.292 --> 21:25.292
Ah, never... never gets old for her, sir.

21:25.375 --> 21:27.000
You poor troll.

21:27.083 --> 21:30.625
I know just the thing to take away
the sting of a day spent with Mother.

21:30.708 --> 21:33.333
I'll get the nail file and clippers, okay?

21:33.417 --> 21:34.583
Come along, Glummy!

21:34.667 --> 21:36.417
Great.
