02:15.166 --> 02:15.916
Madame.

02:16.916 --> 02:18.125
Madam Curie?

02:20.125 --> 02:21.125
Get an ambulance car!

02:23.833 --> 02:25.166
Madame? What happened?

02:33.041 --> 02:34.541
Hurry, She is very weak!

02:35.000 --> 02:36.625
This is Madam Curie?

03:14.166 --> 03:15.000
Duclaux?

03:15.458 --> 03:16.375
Yes.

03:17.666 --> 03:19.791
Are you interested in Microbiology?

03:21.041 --> 03:23.708
I am interested in all science that confronts 
prevailing attitude.

03:24.916 --> 03:26.208
I am Pierre Curie.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.583
Hello, Mr Curie.

03:30.750 --> 03:31.541
Goodbye.

03:53.875 --> 03:55.333
You're with company.

03:56.125 --> 03:57.166
I have intruded.

03:57.833 --> 03:59.166
You have.

04:00.375 --> 04:04.708
Now is your opportunity to tell us why you may 
have intruded mademoiselle Sklodowska.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.583
Professor Lippmann!

04:06.750 --> 04:08.750
I want to protest in the strongest possible 
terms!

04:08.916 --> 04:11.625
My equipment was moved again last night.

04:12.875 --> 04:14.041
There is a simple reason for that.

04:14.208 --> 04:16.083
More than simple, it is a distinct lack of respect,

04:16.250 --> 04:18.833
by those who share your laboratory with me!

04:20.125 --> 04:23.500
Allow me to pose an opposing hypothesis,
Ma'am Sklodowska.

04:23.666 --> 04:26.291
It might be your equipment takes up too much space.

04:26.458 --> 04:29.458
Yes but scientist equipment cannot be
kept in a precise position in which it was left..

04:29.625 --> 04:31.583
We are not savages, we are scientist, I couldn't agree more.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.125
Then all I need is your assurance..

04:33.291 --> 04:35.916
Ma'am Sklodowska,
please leave my laboratory.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.291
Leave?

04:40.041 --> 04:41.833
We cannot keep you in the manner you require.

04:43.041 --> 04:44.208
But I have no where else to go.

04:45.958 --> 04:48.833
Then you have to setup a laboratory on your own,
Ma'am Sklodowska.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.208
I lack the funds.

04:53.541 --> 04:57.958
Then your lack of foresight in presenting me,
constantly with demands,

04:58.125 --> 05:01.458
is something that will teach all of 
us a valuable lesson.

05:16.041 --> 05:17.708
Maybe it's because I am polish?

05:17.875 --> 05:18.916
Of cos not.

05:19.083 --> 05:20.625
Or because I am not a man?

05:20.791 --> 05:23.125
It might be that, but Maria...

05:23.291 --> 05:25.333
We are in Paris, I have taken the name Marie.

05:27.083 --> 05:29.083
- Your child is crying.
- Yes I am aware of that.

05:29.250 --> 05:32.458
So shouldn't you assumed some sort of
motherly position?

05:32.625 --> 05:34.708
- Sorry, madame.
- Thank you!

05:41.166 --> 05:42.500
What if you were to vist him,

05:43.000 --> 05:43.875
apologise.

05:44.041 --> 05:46.791
I came all the way from Poland
to study Science!

05:47.458 --> 05:49.500
I can't apologise
science is lost to me!

05:49.666 --> 05:51.125
I am going to have to become a teacher!

05:51.416 --> 05:54.041
Oh you are impossibly dramatic!

05:55.750 --> 05:57.833
Your child is dramatic.

06:02.250 --> 06:03.458
Maria...

06:04.916 --> 06:06.750
- Apologise.
- No, never.

06:07.458 --> 06:09.000
I will find my own way.

06:34.333 --> 06:35.333
No.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.916
Please don't suppose anything
by me standing beside you.

07:18.750 --> 07:21.083
It's the women from the street with 
the Duclaux.

07:21.250 --> 07:22.041
Hello.

07:22.208 --> 07:25.458
I stand beside you, maybe because
you look as awkward as I feel, and I made did,

07:25.625 --> 07:26.458
Do I seemed awkward?

07:26.625 --> 07:29.041
I think correct assumption that we would look less 
awkward standing together.

07:29.208 --> 07:31.958
- I don't feel awkward.
- than we might standing apart.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.375
Well that's a theory I can support.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.291
I am Pierre Curie.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.041
You do like your name don't you?
That's the second time you have told me. 

07:42.583 --> 07:43.750
Your Maria Sklodowska.

07:44.166 --> 07:45.708
I don't believe I gave you my name?

07:47.791 --> 07:49.333
She's wonderful isn't she?

07:49.625 --> 07:50.833
The dancer.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.375
Her name is Loïe Fuller.
Should you wish to see her again.

07:54.541 --> 07:57.291
Do you make it your business to know
everybody's name? 

07:59.250 --> 08:01.791
She calls it this dancer "La Fire dance".

08:01.958 --> 08:02.625
Why?

08:02.791 --> 08:05.541
I believe it could be she is interested
in the way flame moves.

08:11.833 --> 08:13.833
Your right, you didn't tell me your name,
but I do know it,

08:14.000 --> 08:15.250
for three reasons.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.125
One, your one of the only 23

08:18.291 --> 08:20.541
female scientists within the department.

08:20.708 --> 08:21.625
A prime number.

08:23.791 --> 08:26.500
Two, I heard about your run-in with
professor Lippmann.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.500
That gain you some infamy!

08:32.332 --> 08:33.207
and three.

08:33.832 --> 08:36.957
I read your paper on the magnetic
properties of steel.

08:37.707 --> 08:40.125
It contains some exceptional science.

08:43.707 --> 08:44.416
Thank you.

08:47.458 --> 08:48.958
And you, as if you been so kind 
I would admit,

08:49.125 --> 08:52.250
that I also read your paper on crystalisation.

08:52.416 --> 08:54.291
which I enjoyed very much.

08:56.708 --> 08:57.791
Thank you.

09:00.041 --> 09:03.000
I also heard what Lippmann did, evicting 
you from your lab. I am sorry. 

09:03.166 --> 09:05.500
I don't need pity, Mr Curie.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.500
- But if I could be of any assistance...
- I would be fine.

09:39.916 --> 09:43.458
Just to be clear, I refuse to be grateful for 
a scientist to offer another scientist a room.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.208
I am more than capable, and my work..

09:45.375 --> 09:47.416
Your ingratitude is entirely correct.

09:47.583 --> 09:50.416
Also, I think it's worth pointing out that
I will not be a mistress.

09:51.375 --> 09:53.125
That thought hasn't occured to me.

09:53.291 --> 09:54.916
I won't tolerate meddling.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.625
I will not be taught how my experiments
to be optimised..

09:57.791 --> 09:59.750
Well I enjoy sharing science,
and I think by working together..

09:59.916 --> 10:01.541
I will not tolerate it.

10:03.250 --> 10:06.666
Well your going to have to learn to tolerate it.
I like collaboration.

10:06.833 --> 10:08.333
I will take an interest in your work

10:08.500 --> 10:11.375
And I will be interested if you taken an interest
in mine. 

10:12.000 --> 10:13.041
Ma'am Sklodowska!

10:14.333 --> 10:17.666
Before you turn your back on the only room,
anyone is offering you. 

10:17.833 --> 10:20.291
Would you at least see what I work?

10:27.500 --> 10:28.583
Basic.

10:30.625 --> 10:33.416
Marcel, André, Maurice, Paul

10:33.583 --> 10:36.625
May I introduce Ma'am Marie Sklodowska.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.208
Such a pleasure to meet you, Ma'am Sklodowska.

10:39.375 --> 10:41.250
- We heard so much about you.
- You have?

10:41.916 --> 10:45.458
The academy probably dislike me almost as
much as they dislike you.

10:45.625 --> 10:48.333
I have been passed over for every
major advancements,

10:48.875 --> 10:50.541
professorship, funding.

10:51.416 --> 10:54.000
Why?
I am not entirely sure,

10:54.166 --> 10:56.750
maybe I bore them, maybe I scare them.
But they do me not great favour either.

10:57.541 --> 10:59.250
But your a scientist to some renowed.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.958
Well I am asking you to share my renowed,

11:03.125 --> 11:05.583
yet basic space with me.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.500
Why are you asking?

11:09.875 --> 11:11.458
I have an instinct about you.

11:13.708 --> 11:16.000
An instinct is not particularly a scientific reason.

11:16.416 --> 11:18.000
Nor if it's still a reason.

11:22.458 --> 11:23.375
Yes.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.666
Yes, this will suit my needs entirely.

11:30.333 --> 11:31.333
Good.

12:10.833 --> 12:14.083
- You have been frowning at that all week.
- I am observing.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.916
- What are you looking for?
- I find it easier to observe when I am not talking.

12:23.583 --> 12:26.000
I measure uraninum and I discover

12:26.166 --> 12:28.833
less radiation than I do
in its ore.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.291
The ore is more powerful than the element?

12:32.458 --> 12:33.708
Exactly.

12:33.875 --> 12:36.083
- And I can't be...
- There some be some anamoly in the results.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.958
I run the same test six times,

12:38.125 --> 12:39.583
I get identical results.

12:41.291 --> 12:44.625
My instinct is that there is another element

12:45.208 --> 12:47.000
that is skewing the results.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.958
You think you found an undiscovered element?

12:49.375 --> 12:52.291
- If your laughing at me..
- No I am not laughing at you.

12:53.333 --> 12:54.666
That's exciting.

12:58.125 --> 13:01.000
- Your measuring equipment is useless.
- It's worked perfectly fine for me.

13:01.166 --> 13:02.708
If we are going to get the figures you need, we something 

13:02.875 --> 13:05.208
that is capable of extreme precision.

13:05.375 --> 13:06.666
There is no "we".

13:07.041 --> 13:09.833
You need something that is capable of measuring
microscopic aspects..

13:10.000 --> 13:12.375
- No please, no no no!
- I have an idea.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.083
Follow me.

13:37.625 --> 13:38.625
Mr. Curie.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.708
Sorry, I know it's some distance.

13:44.875 --> 13:47.458
The length of our journey doesn't agitate me, Mr Curie. 

13:48.083 --> 13:49.750
The distination does.

13:50.916 --> 13:53.375
This is one of the finest hospital in Paris, there 
is a piece of equipment.. 

13:53.541 --> 13:56.333
I chose not to go into hospital.

13:57.625 --> 13:59.791
But your a scientist!

14:17.083 --> 14:18.208
<i>Maria...</i>

14:19.333 --> 14:20.958
<i>Are you frightened?</i>

14:24.208 --> 14:25.291
Of what?

14:26.916 --> 14:28.416
Of my illness.

14:30.875 --> 14:31.916
No.

14:32.666 --> 14:33.875
Good.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.291
Cause there is no reason to be frightened.

14:41.625 --> 14:43.250
Will you die?

14:45.083 --> 14:47.125
But if you cure me.

14:47.708 --> 14:49.166
How can I cure you?

14:49.833 --> 14:51.208
You can kiss me.

14:52.250 --> 14:55.458
If you kiss me again, I promise I
won't die. 

14:55.750 --> 14:57.083
But brunie says...

14:57.250 --> 14:58.791
Your sister doesn't know everything.

14:59.916 --> 15:01.083
Kiss me.

15:07.583 --> 15:08.750
Did you feel that?

15:09.958 --> 15:11.125
No.

15:12.791 --> 15:14.875
That was the sound of the world 

15:15.041 --> 15:17.083
turning in a new direction.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.500
The Maria Sklodowska direction.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.291
I can't feel it.

15:26.791 --> 15:28.000
Kiss me again.

15:33.916 --> 15:34.875
Now,

15:35.791 --> 15:37.208
can you feel it?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.125
Yes.

15:42.958 --> 15:44.208
I think I did.

15:44.958 --> 15:46.333
You cured me.

16:18.791 --> 16:20.458
Sorry, that took longer than I thought.

16:20.625 --> 16:21.541
Are you feeling better?

16:21.708 --> 16:24.666
I decided, my experiments can cope perfectly well
without your equipment. 

16:26.708 --> 16:28.291
When you were working with crystals,

16:28.458 --> 16:32.541
you need to be able to measure microscopic amounts of charge,

16:32.958 --> 16:34.250
and nothing works.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.666
Until I build this.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.125
It's a quadrant electrometer.

16:42.291 --> 16:43.416
It's capable of measuring, 

16:43.583 --> 16:44.791
precisely,

16:45.708 --> 16:48.041
the tiny amounts of electrical charge in a material.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.041
It measures electrical potential?

16:51.291 --> 16:53.000
Your equipment isn't good enough.

16:53.625 --> 16:54.541
Mine is.

16:54.708 --> 16:56.708
Your science is brillant.

16:57.166 --> 16:58.583
So is mine.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.208
Your proposing a partnership?

17:03.625 --> 17:05.083
That's exactly what I am doing.

17:07.583 --> 17:10.500
Well basically, it's just a question of dissolving.

17:10.708 --> 17:13.000
My husband is looking at me disapprovingly again.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.208
I am doing nothing of that sort.

17:14.375 --> 17:16.875
You think I am asking stupid questions to your
eminent friends. 

17:17.915 --> 17:19.875
The questions aren't stupid, really.

17:20.583 --> 17:22.708
My mother told me:
"Never marry a brillant man."

17:22.875 --> 17:24.500
You will disappoint them, and they will disappoint you.

17:25.474 --> 17:26.750
And why would I disappoint you?

17:26.915 --> 17:30.000
By failing to avoid making her feel inadequate
I would suspect.

17:30.833 --> 17:32.000
This one I can say.

17:34.416 --> 17:36.625
No I will clear, your asking the questions.

17:39.958 --> 17:41.375
So you,

17:42.125 --> 17:43.208
take the,

17:43.666 --> 17:44.875
ore,

17:45.041 --> 17:47.250
and you dissolve into it.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.375
Well, we take the pitchblend,

17:49.541 --> 17:50.833
which is a special ore,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.500
that comes all the way from a mine in Bohemia,

17:54.166 --> 17:56.041
and then we use a scientific process to,

17:56.208 --> 17:58.250
remove the elements we know we can remove, 

17:58.416 --> 18:00.083
and look at what's left.

18:00.458 --> 18:02.583
And what scientific processes might you use?

18:02.750 --> 18:04.375
These are very good questions.

18:04.958 --> 18:05.666
We crush it.

18:06.583 --> 18:08.458
Which is extremely hard work.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.166
Then we boil it,

18:10.333 --> 18:12.875
Which results in the removal of substances.

18:13.625 --> 18:14.541
We add,

18:14.708 --> 18:16.958
acidic and alkaline solutions to it.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.166
Until only that

18:19.333 --> 18:20.416
which is pure remains.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.625
And there is alot of substance to remove.

18:22.791 --> 18:23.583
And it would be worth it.

18:24.000 --> 18:24.875
It's very exciting! 

18:25.250 --> 18:27.375
And why are you looking at Uranium in the first place?

18:27.541 --> 18:30.000
- Becquerel.
- One of the more competent scientist.

18:30.166 --> 18:31.750
Becquerel discovered accidentally

18:31.916 --> 18:34.875
that uranium salts wrapped in a black cloth, 
left in a drawer,

18:35.041 --> 18:37.333
left an impression on a photographic plate.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.375
And he thought

18:38.541 --> 18:41.666
that the Uranium is having an unusual
chemical reaction with something in the atmosphere.

18:41.833 --> 18:43.916
I say, it's the element itself.

18:52.333 --> 18:54.583
- A very radical thought.
- I still don't understand.

18:54.750 --> 18:57.250
Imagine a grape.
How do you turn a grape into wine?

18:57.416 --> 18:58.791
Well you crush it and ferment it.

18:58.958 --> 19:01.958
Yes, so imagine a grape crushes itself,
ferments itself,

19:02.625 --> 19:03.958
changes it's very being.

19:04.416 --> 19:05.875
And what if I told you that,

19:06.041 --> 19:07.708
as the grape turns itself into wine,

19:07.875 --> 19:09.833
it releases a powerful surge of energy,

19:10.000 --> 19:11.416
power that can make things happen.

19:14.333 --> 19:15.625
You will be excited, am I right?

19:16.333 --> 19:17.333
I think so, yes I would.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.875
So science is changing.

19:20.041 --> 19:21.875
And the very people who are running science,

19:22.041 --> 19:25.875
are the people who believe, that the world is flat,
and I am going to prove them wrong. 

19:26.041 --> 19:27.375
Just as Newton did.

19:28.666 --> 19:30.000
- We are.
- Thank you.

19:38.458 --> 19:40.708
I see the way you look at me Pierre.

19:41.833 --> 19:43.375
How do I look at you?

19:44.250 --> 19:45.958
Like a fermenting grape?

19:46.625 --> 19:49.541
- I enjoyed that analogy.
- That was a good analogy.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.166
But your right.

19:57.625 --> 19:59.583
I do look at you in a certain way.

20:00.916 --> 20:02.375
And sometimes..

20:02.958 --> 20:05.791
I have the feeling you look at me the same way back.

20:06.750 --> 20:09.791
When my mother died, I couldn't speak for a week. 

20:09.958 --> 20:11.833
And people thought it was grieve.
It wasn't.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.041
It was that I simply couldn't comprehend,

20:14.208 --> 20:16.833
why something so important had been
taken from me.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.083
I have been selfish my entire life Pierre,
and if you have to change that..

20:20.250 --> 20:22.708
Your not selfish.
Your just..

20:23.500 --> 20:24.916
self-absorbed.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.375
And you don't like anyone to take what's yours.

20:27.541 --> 20:30.375
I will never be the women nor the wife you want 
me to be.

20:32.250 --> 20:33.791
You laugh at me.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.708
I have presumptuous.

20:36.875 --> 20:39.125
I know, we hardly know each other. 

20:39.291 --> 20:40.958
I am laughing because,

20:41.291 --> 20:44.416
you denied me the chance to propose to you.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.916
Oh yes I have.

20:48.083 --> 20:49.250
Hadn't I?

20:50.833 --> 20:54.416
Well as a matter of scientific interest, was proposing
even your intention?

20:55.125 --> 20:59.625
Well as a matter of scientific interest, 
the thought was fully formed in my head yet. 

21:00.958 --> 21:03.208
As you said, we hardly know each other. 

21:05.083 --> 21:07.125
But yes, I suspect it was. 

21:15.166 --> 21:16.750
Marie Sklodowska.

21:19.208 --> 21:21.791
You are better than any women

21:21.958 --> 21:23.666
that I could have hoped for.

21:25.083 --> 21:27.750
And I would never consider you my women. 

21:30.083 --> 21:32.250
I would like to share my life with you.

22:01.375 --> 22:02.458
Thank you every much.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.041
This way please.

22:05.541 --> 22:06.583
Don't move.

22:53.625 --> 22:56.000
Remind me whenever I forget, that we should leave Paris. 

22:56.166 --> 22:58.583
As often as humanly possible.

22:59.791 --> 23:02.416
We shoud experience all the world it has to offer.

23:03.458 --> 23:04.750
Remind me,

23:05.083 --> 23:08.916
to retrain you out of that glorious need to 
overstate everything. 

23:14.250 --> 23:16.541
I thought I was finish with women.

23:19.333 --> 23:20.250
What?

23:20.416 --> 23:23.375
From what you told me, you barely started with.

23:26.708 --> 23:27.791
I mean,

23:28.125 --> 23:31.125
I thought I just wanted to concentrate on science.

23:32.583 --> 23:35.708
You do love these pompous phrases don't you?

23:38.833 --> 23:41.416
Are you turning around.

23:41.583 --> 23:43.958
I think you drugged me into compliance.

23:44.291 --> 23:45.958
I did no such thing!

23:47.666 --> 23:49.375
Your just extraordinary.

23:53.375 --> 23:54.541
This is entirely ridiculous.

23:55.375 --> 23:56.625
I am carrying you over the threshold.

23:56.791 --> 23:58.250
Your not, you're blindfolding me

23:58.416 --> 24:00.708
over the threshold, which requires
far lesser on your part than mine.

24:01.208 --> 24:03.000
The academy has, in honor of our wedding.

24:03.166 --> 24:04.291
And because they are excited by our work?

24:04.458 --> 24:07.916
decided to furbish us with new lodgings
in which to deal with,

24:08.083 --> 24:09.750
the pitchblend at our disposal.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.250
- Then why do I need to be blindfolded?
- More exciting.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.375
Ready?

24:23.208 --> 24:24.291
Hello, Paul.

24:24.916 --> 24:26.250
Welcome to Versailles.

24:26.791 --> 24:28.958
- This..
- Not quite what we wished for.

24:29.125 --> 24:30.041
It's a lean to.

24:30.208 --> 24:31.500
Wait till you see inside.

24:34.958 --> 24:35.958
This is..

24:38.416 --> 24:39.291
Isn't it?

24:43.541 --> 24:45.000
They have outdone themselves.

24:45.166 --> 24:46.458
They have.

24:47.416 --> 24:48.333
Hello.

24:48.500 --> 24:51.083
I have an order.
Marie Sklodowska?

24:51.250 --> 24:54.166
It's Marie Curie now, but this is the right place. 

24:55.375 --> 24:57.500
- I will put it in the yard, shall I.
- Thanks.

24:58.500 --> 24:59.958
Is it the Pitchblend?

26:02.208 --> 26:03.916
- Careful.
- I am careful.

26:08.291 --> 26:09.125
Again.

27:13.375 --> 27:14.541
Irène?

27:15.083 --> 27:16.166
Irène.

27:31.833 --> 27:32.750
Yes.

27:35.791 --> 27:36.958
Here.

27:57.875 --> 27:59.166
Shhh, Paul.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.791
That's Radium.

28:07.583 --> 28:08.750
Radium?

28:09.166 --> 28:11.041
A pink prick of radium.

28:12.041 --> 28:14.875
Gathered from 4 tons of pitchblende.

28:16.125 --> 28:17.916
There is more to find.

28:21.208 --> 28:23.458
Isn't it the most beautiful thing you have ever seen?

28:24.541 --> 28:26.166
And you're sure? You're sure of it?

28:26.333 --> 28:27.541
I am certain.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.250
Yes.

28:31.291 --> 28:33.583
It is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.250
Well, I guess everything changes now does it?

28:41.250 --> 28:42.416
Yes.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.708
We thought we would find a new element.

29:01.625 --> 29:02.541
We were wrong.

29:04.125 --> 29:06.166
It's taken 4 years,

29:06.541 --> 29:09.541
4 tons of pitchblend,

29:10.166 --> 29:13.208
40 tons of corrosive chemicals,

29:13.375 --> 29:15.916
and 400 tons of water.

29:18.750 --> 29:20.916
We are here to present to you,

29:21.250 --> 29:23.125
2 new elements.

29:23.750 --> 29:25.125
Polonium,

29:25.541 --> 29:26.666
and Radium.

29:28.458 --> 29:30.958
We all thought that atoms were finite and stable.

29:31.125 --> 29:32.666
Well, it turns out some of them are not.

29:33.625 --> 29:35.458
And in their instability,

29:36.625 --> 29:38.291
they emit rays.

29:39.375 --> 29:40.958
I have called this, 

29:41.916 --> 29:43.791
radioactivity.

29:45.291 --> 29:48.333
We are here to tell you that you have 
fundamentally,

29:49.125 --> 29:51.500
misunderstood the atom.

29:58.375 --> 29:59.250
Look here!

30:37.583 --> 30:39.083
Lady or a man?

30:39.666 --> 30:41.166
A lady obviously.

30:42.333 --> 30:43.416
Hello.

30:44.083 --> 30:45.291
Have you ordered?

30:45.458 --> 30:46.583
Champagne!

30:47.833 --> 30:48.708
- Why?
- I got it.

30:48.875 --> 30:50.416
- You got it? What?
- I am a professor.

30:50.583 --> 30:51.958
- You are?
- I am!

30:52.875 --> 30:54.875
Finally they realised there is something to us.

30:55.041 --> 30:56.166
Be careful.

30:58.041 --> 30:59.125
Why?

31:01.416 --> 31:02.458
- No.
- Yes.

31:05.250 --> 31:08.875
I am professor Curie and I am going to
have 2 children. 

31:11.958 --> 31:14.250
Congratulations, Professor Curie.

31:25.208 --> 31:26.333
Where are we going?

31:26.500 --> 31:28.208
I am taking you somewhere, I think you are going to like.

31:28.375 --> 31:30.125
But I am tired, I am pregnant. 

31:30.291 --> 31:31.583
and it's freezing.

31:32.583 --> 31:34.666
Loïe Fuller has invited us to a seance.

31:34.833 --> 31:35.833
Loïe Fuller?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.125
Spiritualism? Oh you cannot be serious.

31:38.291 --> 31:39.875
It is science, like any other.

31:40.041 --> 31:43.125
Don't talk such rot.
There is nothing to see or analyse.

31:43.708 --> 31:45.500
You can't see radioactivity.

31:45.666 --> 31:47.083
That is completely different.

31:52.458 --> 31:53.791
Good evening, Loïe.

31:54.708 --> 31:56.166
We live in world,

31:57.291 --> 31:59.250
where invisible light,

32:00.125 --> 32:02.125
can pass through flesh,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.791
and exposed the bones beneath it.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.333
Using "X" gazes,

32:08.500 --> 32:10.291
I will call out,

32:10.666 --> 32:13.000
the presence of Beethoven,

32:13.666 --> 32:16.125
as it becomes clear to me.

32:16.583 --> 32:18.041
"X" gazes?

32:18.208 --> 32:20.750
- As in uranium Rays?
- Yes.

32:23.208 --> 32:24.791
In a little while,

32:24.958 --> 32:26.250
the portrait,

32:26.625 --> 32:28.041
of Beethoven,

32:28.375 --> 32:29.833
will appear,

32:30.875 --> 32:33.000
on this photographic plate.

32:33.166 --> 32:35.708
And now Beethoven is going to come back
from the dead. 

32:40.291 --> 32:42.791
She is using our science to further her work.

32:43.208 --> 32:45.625
All scientists work on previous works.

32:45.791 --> 32:47.541
You call this science?

32:48.291 --> 32:50.416
This could change science forever.

32:51.041 --> 32:54.000
Do you not understand, we already change science forever.

33:53.125 --> 33:55.000
That's stronger on the other.

33:57.375 --> 33:58.750
This is definitely more refined.

34:01.041 --> 34:02.583
We had another submission.

34:03.583 --> 34:04.583
What do they want?

34:04.750 --> 34:06.708
Radioactive smelling salts.

34:06.875 --> 34:08.500
As a cure for baldness.

34:09.416 --> 34:10.666
What did you say?

34:10.833 --> 34:14.791
"We don't own Radium, we don't have a patent
and you are free to do as you will with it."

34:16.083 --> 34:18.458
If we did had a patent,
we would have a bigger laboratory.

34:20.958 --> 34:22.750
I know the possibility of science...

34:22.916 --> 34:25.333
If we hand it to them,
then people won't be able to enjoy the possibilities.

34:25.833 --> 34:28.458
But it's trusting others to see the possibility,
that I am not sure of. 

34:28.875 --> 34:32.000
Oh people can see the possibilities, believe me. 

34:35.375 --> 34:36.458
Radioactive matches.

34:37.333 --> 34:40.041
Radioactive cigarettes.

34:40.583 --> 34:42.333
Radioactive chocolate.

34:42.916 --> 34:45.000
Radioactive toothpaste.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.458
There is a letter in here. 

34:47.625 --> 34:49.375
Radioactive beauty powder.

34:49.541 --> 34:52.583
Loïe Fuller wants a radioactive jacket for her dance.

34:53.208 --> 34:56.125
Don't worry, I told her we don't make jackets.

34:57.083 --> 35:00.708
Have you heard a dance craze in Broadway,
based on our work?

35:00.875 --> 35:02.750
The "Piff, Paff, Pouf" !

35:02.916 --> 35:04.166
What have we done? 

35:06.208 --> 35:07.416
What's that?

35:10.041 --> 35:11.208
That's nothing.

35:14.291 --> 35:18.875
Henri Danlos, the dermatologist came to me the other day,
very excited. 

35:19.750 --> 35:23.750
He put some radium chloride on a tumor.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.708
And it showed but considerably shrinkage.

35:28.541 --> 35:29.916
Shrinkage?

35:32.041 --> 35:33.708
Two thousand years,

35:33.875 --> 35:36.916
cancer, the incurable illness.

35:37.541 --> 35:38.541
Can you imagine?

35:40.416 --> 35:42.291
They are starting a study group.

35:42.833 --> 35:44.958
He thinks our radium can cure cancer?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.250
Danlos is just the start. 

35:49.708 --> 35:53.750
I can feel our work glowing out.

35:53.916 --> 35:56.291
I can feel it changing the world.

36:06.541 --> 36:07.890
Mr Warner? I am doctor Jenkins.

36:10.520 --> 36:12.250
And you, must be Peter.

36:14.000 --> 36:14.916
Hello.

36:15.583 --> 36:16.875
Do you know who this guy is?

36:17.041 --> 36:19.916
This guy, he is the doctor, he is going to make you a
lot better.

36:20.083 --> 36:22.541
And then you know what, we are all going to go home.

36:23.250 --> 36:25.541
We are going to use what it's called a
linear accelerator.

36:25.708 --> 36:26.750
Linear what?

36:27.458 --> 36:29.666
It's at the forefront of science, Mr Warner.

36:29.833 --> 36:31.625
But you have used one before?

36:31.791 --> 36:33.791
In this hospital,
your son will be the first to use it.

36:34.416 --> 36:37.083
Around the world,
it's the fifth machine of it's kind.

36:37.250 --> 36:39.833
My child is not a monkey for your research.

36:40.541 --> 36:42.875
Unless we find a way to make peter better,

36:43.041 --> 36:46.541
this cancer will grow, and it will infiltrate
all his major organs.

36:47.166 --> 36:49.625
This machine will shrink his tumor, I guarantee it.

36:49.791 --> 36:51.875
Will it shrink it enough? I can't say.

36:52.041 --> 36:55.083
But it will substantially improve your child chance
to survival. 

36:58.500 --> 37:00.208
I want to see it.

37:00.666 --> 37:01.958
Of cos you do.

37:06.375 --> 37:08.666
It's bigger than I expected.

37:09.541 --> 37:12.458
It's a machine with an incredible amount of
power inside it. 

37:12.875 --> 37:14.625
It's needs to be big.

37:15.125 --> 37:16.750
Wait, he is going to be inside it?

37:16.916 --> 37:17.875
No.

37:19.625 --> 37:21.583
He will be strapped in here.

37:22.375 --> 37:23.958
He will be strapped?

37:24.833 --> 37:26.791
It's just so he doesn't move.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.583
We need to be very precise

37:28.750 --> 37:30.541
as we use rays.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.375
Will he be in pain?

37:34.041 --> 37:37.916
M. Warner, this machine will improve your son's life.

37:38.416 --> 37:39.708
It may even save it.

37:46.166 --> 37:47.708
Stay still, son.

38:15.333 --> 38:16.583
Bad news, is it bad news?

38:16.750 --> 38:19.291
No, it's not bad news,
it's going well.

38:19.458 --> 38:21.958
It worked? You mean he is better?

38:22.541 --> 38:25.958
It's a long road, Mr Warner,
but we got off to a good start.

38:26.458 --> 38:27.958
Would you like to see him?

38:34.041 --> 38:35.625
I swear, this is the last time I come here.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.458
Just wait and see.

38:48.166 --> 38:50.416
She needs silence for the inter-plasma to appear.

38:50.583 --> 38:51.666
What?

38:52.083 --> 38:54.541
- Is the radium hurting you?
- No I took it off.

38:54.708 --> 38:57.041
It did prove to hit the flesh,

38:57.208 --> 38:58.500
turned it gray. Look.

38:59.541 --> 39:00.958
There is a lesion. 

39:01.125 --> 39:02.458
It's fascinating.

39:17.458 --> 39:19.125
She is a complete fraud.

39:19.291 --> 39:22.041
And they have formed some sort of mysterious friendship.

39:23.708 --> 39:27.916
He has promised to weight her, before during and after 
the sessions,

39:28.083 --> 39:30.125
to see if there really is a spirit, that's really

39:30.500 --> 39:31.666
coming in.

39:32.583 --> 39:33.958
I think you are jealous.

39:34.250 --> 39:35.833
I am not jealous.

39:36.375 --> 39:40.583
I am outraged, because I think he should take 
what we do far more seriously. 

39:42.166 --> 39:43.625
Oh heavens..

39:43.791 --> 39:44.958
Come, he recognise me.

39:48.625 --> 39:49.916
We are on the front of the newspaper.

39:50.083 --> 39:51.583
He will recognise me.

39:52.583 --> 39:55.458
People can't believe that I am the sister of the famous
Madam Curie. 

39:55.916 --> 39:57.541
Fame is for idiots.

39:57.708 --> 40:00.708
And look it seems to give Pierre, some very strange ideas.

40:01.041 --> 40:03.625
Well, allow him to be strange.

40:04.250 --> 40:05.791
Enjoy his enjoyment.

40:05.958 --> 40:07.166
What? Spiritualism?

40:07.458 --> 40:08.916
Faith isn't such a bad thing.

40:09.083 --> 40:12.498
I have faith, I have faith in humanity, I have faith 
in progress.

40:12.725 --> 40:16.416
But faith in the afterlife has no 
scientific foundation whatsoever.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.458
You never think that mother might be..

40:21.375 --> 40:23.250
somewhere better than this?

40:23.666 --> 40:24.666
I do.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.208
In a hole, in the ground, in Poland.

40:28.375 --> 40:29.708
A place far superior to Paris.

40:30.875 --> 40:31.791
Maria,

40:31.958 --> 40:33.833
you are so cynical.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.833
No, my dear just realistic.

40:50.666 --> 40:52.166
Who are you writing to?

40:53.750 --> 40:55.625
They want to give me the legion of Honor.

40:56.166 --> 40:57.125
So I am responding.

40:57.541 --> 40:58.708
What's your response?

40:58.875 --> 41:03.291
I have asked them to thank the minister,
but I do not feel the need to be decorated at all.

41:05.541 --> 41:06.583
And you are,

41:06.750 --> 41:08.916
have the greatest need for a better laboratory.

41:11.583 --> 41:13.000
You're coughing a lot.

41:13.166 --> 41:14.291
Have I?

41:15.333 --> 41:16.333
Marie.

41:22.625 --> 41:24.958
Don't take me to a hospital, I won't go to a hospital.

41:26.625 --> 41:27.583
Wait here.

41:28.500 --> 41:29.791
Forceps, please.

41:30.708 --> 41:31.916
Now, I need you to push.

41:32.083 --> 41:33.500
- I can't.
- Just breathe.

41:39.166 --> 41:40.916
I thought we lost her.

41:42.083 --> 41:45.750
The famous Marie Curie needed help, and everyone
came running.

41:45.916 --> 41:47.375
She should have died.

41:48.208 --> 41:49.666
But they saved her.

41:51.041 --> 41:52.166
And you.

42:01.916 --> 42:03.083
Ève.

42:07.750 --> 42:08.708
Irène.

42:09.833 --> 42:11.666
What are you thinking about?

42:13.000 --> 42:14.208
I don't know.

42:17.458 --> 42:19.250
You're not thinking about anything?

42:20.791 --> 42:21.958
I don't know.

42:22.833 --> 42:25.583
You must always be thinking about something.

42:29.083 --> 42:30.291
What are you thinking about?

42:31.958 --> 42:34.250
Think you are too young to understand.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.375
Our work has been nominated for the Nobel prize.

42:49.666 --> 42:52.125
For our discovery of radioactivity.

42:55.333 --> 42:56.458
The commendation,

42:56.958 --> 42:58.958
only mentions my name.

42:59.250 --> 42:59.958
And.. 

43:00.625 --> 43:01.625
And?

43:02.291 --> 43:05.500
And I told them if there is a Nobel prize to win,

43:06.125 --> 43:07.875
we win it together.

43:26.333 --> 43:28.166
Oh Paul, I need a chair.

43:39.708 --> 43:41.125
What time is it?

43:44.291 --> 43:45.250
Ten after twelve.

43:46.041 --> 43:47.791
What time is it in Sweden?

43:48.166 --> 43:49.708
Ten after twelve.

43:52.458 --> 43:54.833
Are you sure this is where you want to be?

43:55.791 --> 43:57.083
Seems,

43:59.166 --> 44:00.916
seems the right place.

44:34.333 --> 44:35.458
Are you ready, Mr Curie?

44:42.041 --> 44:43.041
No.

44:48.041 --> 44:49.541
It can be thought,

44:49.708 --> 44:52.791
that Radium may become very dangerous, in criminal hands.

44:53.291 --> 44:55.833
This is Colonel Tibbets, on the Enola Gay.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.833
Do you receive, Washington, over?

44:58.000 --> 45:00.208
<i>Receiving, Colonel Tibbets. Over.</i>

45:00.916 --> 45:05.000
Washington, Captain Robert Lewis just informed me
Little Boy is now live.

45:05.375 --> 45:06.958
Permission to drop, over.

45:07.125 --> 45:08.208
<i>Permission granted, Colonel. Over.</i>

45:11.291 --> 45:12.958
Here, the question can be raised,

45:13.125 --> 45:17.041
whether mankind benefits from knowing the 
secrets of nature,

45:17.208 --> 45:19.958
whether it is ready to profit from them,

45:20.166 --> 45:22.708
or whether this knowledge will not be harmful to it.

45:22.875 --> 45:24.291
On my mark,

45:25.333 --> 45:26.041
three,

45:27.916 --> 45:28.625
two,

45:30.750 --> 45:31.708
one.

45:36.875 --> 45:40.833
The example of the discoveries of Nobel it's characteristics.

45:41.375 --> 45:43.875
This high power explosives have enabled man, 

45:44.041 --> 45:46.125
to perform wonderful work. 

45:46.291 --> 45:49.000
They are also a terrrible mean of destruction,

45:49.166 --> 45:50.958
in the hands of great criminals,

45:51.125 --> 45:53.208
would led the people towards war.

46:05.666 --> 46:08.500
I am one of those who believed, with Nobel,

46:09.208 --> 46:12.583
that mankind will derive more good than harm,

46:12.750 --> 46:14.666
from these new discoveries.

47:01.583 --> 47:02.375
Your back!

47:02.833 --> 47:03.500
I am.

47:04.125 --> 47:05.750
And was it everything you hoped it would be?

47:08.041 --> 47:09.000
Yes.

47:10.583 --> 47:13.208
Did you get all the acclamation
you felt you deserve?

47:14.000 --> 47:16.666
My speech was entirely about you
and your work.

47:16.833 --> 47:18.000
But I am just the wife, isn't that right?

47:18.166 --> 47:21.166
- When have I ever treated you..
- I am the wife of Pierre Curie.

47:21.333 --> 47:25.083
You said you didn't care about professional accomplishments,
you only cared about achievements.

47:25.583 --> 47:26.791
I was the one who fought...

47:26.958 --> 47:28.833
And I am doing what a wife should do,
giving you children,

47:29.000 --> 47:30.500
keeping your home.

47:30.666 --> 47:32.916
You should get out of Paris, paris pollutes us both.

47:33.083 --> 47:36.333
How dare you, how dare you take my brilliance,
how dare you, take that applause.

47:36.500 --> 47:38.416
We should get out and get some air.

47:38.583 --> 47:40.541
"I am one of those, who believed with Nobel"

47:40.708 --> 47:42.625
No, no i made it clear.

47:42.791 --> 47:46.791
- "that mankind derives more.."
- I made it absolutely clear!

47:46.958 --> 47:50.750
You stole my brilliance, you should have never gone without me!

47:50.916 --> 47:52.833
You just given birth.

47:53.041 --> 47:56.166
You were too ill to travel,
and you didn't even want to go!

47:56.333 --> 47:58.333
What was I supposed to do?

47:58.541 --> 48:00.291
This is bigger than both of us, Marie!

48:00.458 --> 48:02.708
And someone had to be there to represent
the achievement!

48:04.916 --> 48:08.750
You never did understand, you were angry because
they didn't want you as one of their own.

48:10.500 --> 48:11.666
Oh you fathom me so well.

48:11.833 --> 48:13.750
I was angry, because they were wrong.

48:13.916 --> 48:16.250
But I never wanted any of this,
I just want to do good science. 

48:16.708 --> 48:19.666
And did I made you a better scientist?

48:19.833 --> 48:22.083
Are we not better scientist together?

48:22.250 --> 48:23.333
Of course we are. 

48:23.666 --> 48:27.833
Because you have one of the finest mind I have ever met,
but just so happen that my mind is finer.

48:30.458 --> 48:32.291
Your main problem Marie, is your arrogance.

48:32.458 --> 48:33.750
My main problem, is you.

48:34.666 --> 48:36.958
and the fact that I love you so utterly.

48:58.916 --> 49:01.458
It's not that I don't understand what is between us.

49:01.875 --> 49:05.583
Is because I don't understand what my life was
without you.

49:08.625 --> 49:11.166
Even when I think of myself as a boy,

49:12.375 --> 49:13.875
somehow you were there.

49:29.833 --> 49:32.333
I wished you would have been in Sweden with me.

49:35.166 --> 49:37.041
I wish we could have been together.

49:51.458 --> 49:53.041
I am sick, Marie.

49:55.375 --> 49:56.583
I am sick.

49:59.625 --> 50:01.291
When I cough, it's blood.

50:04.916 --> 50:06.375
Let's get out of Paris,

50:06.916 --> 50:08.666
and rest and get better.

50:08.833 --> 50:09.916
What about the lab?

50:10.083 --> 50:11.458
That can wait.

50:13.500 --> 50:15.708
- Let's save us.
- There is too much to do.

50:15.875 --> 50:17.166
Please, Marie, Please.

50:45.833 --> 50:48.125
Pierre, don't go too far!

50:51.541 --> 50:52.666
Maria!

50:54.875 --> 50:56.000
Where are you?

52:37.166 --> 52:38.125
Watch out!

53:38.875 --> 53:40.416
Hello, my friend.

53:49.708 --> 53:50.833
Hello.

58:25.458 --> 58:27.625
Good, and do we have copies of that?

58:36.333 --> 58:37.625
Welcome Madam Curie.

58:38.916 --> 58:41.000
I do not know why I am here.

58:41.916 --> 58:44.000
Your here, because the panel would like to consider you

58:44.166 --> 58:46.125
for professor Curie position at the university.

58:49.875 --> 58:51.375
You wish to give me Pierre's seat?

58:52.458 --> 58:54.250
We don't want to give you anything.

58:55.666 --> 58:57.541
We are interviewing a number of candidates and we thought

58:57.708 --> 59:00.208
due consideration should be given to you taking the post.

59:01.833 --> 59:03.041
And if I don't want the post?

59:04.541 --> 59:06.500
Then that is one less candidate for us to consider.

59:08.250 --> 59:10.791
I wish to be considered on my own merits.

59:11.833 --> 59:13.750
If you wish to give me out of pity, don't.

59:13.916 --> 59:16.833
If you wish to give me to follow some agenda or other,

59:17.208 --> 59:18.083
don't.

59:21.625 --> 59:24.041
- Well, what say you...
- I have nothing else to say.

59:25.291 --> 59:28.208
It is not that job I want, but it is a job I will take.

59:29.375 --> 59:32.750
And if my science doesn't speak for itself,
with regards to my quality.

59:33.166 --> 59:35.333
then you have gravely misunderstood my science.

59:41.375 --> 59:43.125
I apologise, gentleman.

59:45.166 --> 59:47.041
Characteristic behaviour I am afraid.

59:56.958 --> 59:58.291
It's an achievement, Marie.

59:58.458 --> 01:00:00.666
First female professor at the Sorbonne?

01:00:01.166 --> 01:00:02.750
A promotion well overdue

01:00:02.916 --> 01:00:06.291
for France and the world first female Nobel
prize winner.

01:00:06.458 --> 01:00:09.375
Nobel prize?
You do remember I wasn't even nominated.

01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:13.708
It was Pierre who fought for me, who fought for
our work to be recognised. 

01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:16.083
Without him, I never would have won.

01:00:16.625 --> 01:00:19.458
His everything to me,
and now he is gone.

01:00:19.625 --> 01:00:20.875
And I am...

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.708
I am lost.

01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:27.625
This would pass, Marie.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:28.916
No it won't.

01:00:29.416 --> 01:00:32.166
- You are being very strong.
- I am bored of strong.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.333
I don't want to be strong,
I want to be weak.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.083
Well Pierre wouldn't want that.

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:38.458
You think you could talk for him?

01:00:45.166 --> 01:00:46.625
I miss him too.

01:01:20.958 --> 01:01:22.416
I want to tell you about Radium.

01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:27.216
A most perculiar and,

01:01:28.041 --> 01:01:29.508
remarkable element because,

01:01:30.508 --> 01:01:33.416
It does not behave as it should.

01:02:22.666 --> 01:02:24.500
We call this place "The doomed town".

01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:27.000
Seems like an extraordinary amount of work.

01:03:03.625 --> 01:03:05.291
The dummies are dressed by J.C Penney.

01:03:07.375 --> 01:03:09.916
Better dressed than the boys.

01:03:12.083 --> 01:03:14.000
The thing is, need to be this precise?

01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:39.458
Pretty cool huh?

01:03:48.333 --> 01:03:49.750
Sorry everyone.

01:03:50.541 --> 01:03:52.541
- It's no problem.
- I don't apologise.

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:57.500
Glasses.

01:05:21.458 --> 01:05:24.625
There are those that say my radium is make him sick.

01:05:28.375 --> 01:05:29.291
Are you sick?

01:05:30.875 --> 01:05:31.291
No.

01:05:32.666 --> 01:05:33.666
You?

01:05:34.666 --> 01:05:35.266
Yes.

01:05:35.916 --> 01:05:37.041
Anemia.

01:05:38.375 --> 01:05:40.791
But there is no proof, there is no proof..

01:05:42.208 --> 01:05:43.208
There are those that say

01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:48.416
that it might be the thing that weakened my Pierre,
that made him unable to roll out of the way.

01:05:48.791 --> 01:05:51.716
Pierre's skull was crushed. He was..

01:05:52.208 --> 01:05:55.041
Radium wouldn't have caused that.

01:05:56.833 --> 01:05:58.875
I can't do anything without him.

01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:02.583
- He want you to.
- I know.

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:04.250
It's expected of you.

01:06:04.416 --> 01:06:06.500
I expected of you too.

01:06:07.166 --> 01:06:09.291
You are the best women,

01:06:09.458 --> 01:06:10.833
I have ever met.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.083
Best person.

01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:18.291
I know what you have lost, Marie.

01:06:19.916 --> 01:06:23.500
Pierre once said to me that, he couldn't imagined a life
without me.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:28.833
And I never said anything back.

01:06:30.541 --> 01:06:31.875
And I should have.

01:07:29.916 --> 01:07:30.916
Do you need feeding?

01:07:32.116 --> 01:07:33.916
No?

01:07:34.416 --> 01:07:36.041
Then run along then.

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:11.208
Radioactivity,

01:08:11.375 --> 01:08:13.708
is the spontaneous emission, 

01:08:13.875 --> 01:08:16.996
of radiation or particles from the decay of nuclei

01:08:17.082 --> 01:08:20.875
which due to a perculiar arrangement of their internal structure

01:08:21.041 --> 01:08:22.625
are far more unstable.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:32.541
Refers to particles which are emitted from Nuclei 
as a result of,

01:08:33.207 --> 01:08:34.750
nuclear instability.

01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:37.207
That's all, thank you. 

01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:55.000
It's not as bad as it sounds.

01:08:55.166 --> 01:08:57.332
- Do we know who are involved?
- There are two.

01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:00.750
Marcel Demalander and Maurice Déménitroux.

01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:02.875
They are preparing Thorium X.

01:09:03.041 --> 01:09:04.166
Thorium X, for who?

01:09:04.332 --> 01:09:06.375
Some factory outside of Paris.

01:09:06.916 --> 01:09:09.082
- Maurice have been off for quite sometime.
- With what?

01:09:09.832 --> 01:09:11.666
- Leukimia.
- And Marcel?

01:09:11.832 --> 01:09:12.832
He has anemia. 

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.375
Severe anemia.

01:09:15.791 --> 01:09:18.332
- And there is a direct link?
- Of cos there is a direct link.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.666
These are radiations and complications.

01:09:20.832 --> 01:09:24.000
These cases are appearing with greater and 
greater regularity.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.582
We were never unaware.

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:28.500
And now we need to be more aware.

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.541
Lost your husband, so you take mine.

01:09:43.457 --> 01:09:45.541
The great Marie Curie.

01:09:46.207 --> 01:09:47.750
Reduced to a thief.

01:09:53.916 --> 01:09:54.708
No.

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:57.750
Your not Marie Curie.

01:09:58.583 --> 01:10:00.916
You don't even deserve that name.

01:10:01.875 --> 01:10:02.958
Your name,

01:10:03.125 --> 01:10:06.416
is Maria Sklodowska and you are polish.

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.291
The dirty Pol.

01:10:10.458 --> 01:10:13.458
The dirty Pol that invented a poison.

01:10:13.625 --> 01:10:16.083
That the world thought marvellous!

01:10:17.708 --> 01:10:19.791
But I know what you are!

01:10:41.166 --> 01:10:42.500
I heard her.

01:10:43.291 --> 01:10:44.875
And yet you stayed inside.

01:10:45.583 --> 01:10:47.583
If you wanted me to join you out there, I would if I.

01:10:50.166 --> 01:10:53.791
The logical thing was to stay inside,
so I stayed inside. 

01:11:02.666 --> 01:11:04.708
I am sorry she said those things.

01:11:05.375 --> 01:11:06.500
Don't be.

01:11:07.916 --> 01:11:08.583
Marie.

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.958
What?

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.916
What do we do now?

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:22.708
4 pages in this piece of nationalist rubbish.

01:11:23.291 --> 01:11:25.708
His wife hired a private detective.

01:11:26.125 --> 01:11:27.875
They stole our letters.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.416
She gave them to the papers, and encourage them

01:11:30.503 --> 01:11:34.166
to print them, it was little little bits of advice I gave him,
mainly on denying her pleasure.

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:39.333
The paper seem outraged by the idea that women,
might have pleasure in their lives. 

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.375
But this intimate pleasures..

01:11:43.125 --> 01:11:45.208
- Your talking here..
- Of sex, yes.

01:11:47.375 --> 01:11:48.791
I have shocked you.

01:11:50.125 --> 01:11:51.458
And everyone else.

01:11:51.625 --> 01:11:53.458
You haven't shocked me.

01:11:54.166 --> 01:11:56.666
You just shouldn't be writing about these things that,

01:11:57.708 --> 01:11:58.958
Intimate.

01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:02.041
And not to be written of.

01:12:03.916 --> 01:12:05.375
People are looking.

01:12:05.541 --> 01:12:07.041
They always looked.

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:11.583
Not like this, not with hate.

01:12:26.166 --> 01:12:28.500
Get out of France you filthy immigrant!

01:12:57.333 --> 01:12:59.458
Marie, may I have a word?

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:00.875
Can't it wait?

01:13:01.125 --> 01:13:02.041
No.

01:13:10.791 --> 01:13:13.416
She's told me that if I go home, this will
all be over.

01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:17.000
I am not entirely convinced, but this will never be over.

01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:22.000
I don't want it to hurt you anymore.

01:13:29.166 --> 01:13:33.166
I think the damage to me is probably permanent,
whatever you persuade her to do.

01:13:35.375 --> 01:13:38.000
Marie, you said you will never love me. 

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:41.458
Pierre, wouldn't want..

01:13:41.625 --> 01:13:44.166
I would say it's a mistake to cite his name in this
conversation, wouldn't you?

01:13:45.583 --> 01:13:46.666
You are not abandoning me.

01:13:46.833 --> 01:13:50.250
I am not a lost dog. You are just leaving me to find
my own way. 

01:13:51.166 --> 01:13:52.458
Now go, be valiant.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.166
Just don't ask me to pity you, as you do so.

01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:34.833
They closed it.

01:14:36.375 --> 01:14:37.708
She died.

01:14:39.333 --> 01:14:40.666
So they closed it.

01:14:50.583 --> 01:14:52.791
I never thought this place, I never thought..

01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:56.625
What she did had any merit.

01:14:57.291 --> 01:14:58.958
You're a scientist.

01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:01.583
She was an artist.

01:15:02.208 --> 01:15:04.583
Or a something.

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:07.041
I don't know quite what she was.

01:15:08.416 --> 01:15:09.541
She died?

01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:13.208
Loïe, will you help me?

01:15:14.458 --> 01:15:17.833
I didn't understand this place,
and you did, and I...

01:15:19.583 --> 01:15:21.125
Can you do what she did?

01:15:22.708 --> 01:15:25.083
I like you to make my husband appear.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.583
I don't think even she promise that.

01:15:28.791 --> 01:15:30.625
Please will you make my husband appear?

01:15:32.491 --> 01:15:35.625
Please will you make my husband appear?

01:15:36.791 --> 01:15:49.625
Please will you make my husband appear?

01:16:39.083 --> 01:16:40.125
Come on!

01:16:42.791 --> 01:16:43.500
Go Go!

01:16:44.541 --> 01:16:45.250
Straight ahead.

01:17:34.875 --> 01:17:36.541
So he is leaving you?

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.083
He was... not strong enough.

01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:46.333
Certainly not strong enough for the press.

01:17:48.125 --> 01:17:51.083
These so-called nationalist calling you 
a dirty pol, a dirty Jew.

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:55.000
I tired to tell them I am a dirty Catholic, 
and a dirty..

01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.000
They won't listen.

01:18:03.458 --> 01:18:04.708
Maria.

01:18:06.583 --> 01:18:08.000
I am going home.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.250
To poland.

01:18:11.916 --> 01:18:13.791
- Will you come with me?
- I belong here.

01:18:13.958 --> 01:18:15.666
But they don't think so.

01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:17.916
France is Irène and Ève's home.

01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:20.458
Irène and Ève would love Poland.

01:18:21.208 --> 01:18:22.791
My work is here.

01:18:23.333 --> 01:18:25.083
Poland has changed.

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:27.916
You will be venerated, celebrated.

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:29.708
Pierre is buried here.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:34.666
They stand outside your house,

01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:37.083
screaming for you to leave.

01:18:42.875 --> 01:18:46.166
What have other people's opinion ever affected
anything I have done?

01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:48.708
Go home!

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:58.000
Your growth is slowing, Ève.

01:19:58.166 --> 01:19:59.333
Is it?

01:20:00.041 --> 01:20:02.458
And Irène is growing faster than ever.

01:20:04.208 --> 01:20:05.791
Well, I have big teeth.

01:20:07.083 --> 01:20:08.083
So you do.

01:20:14.458 --> 01:20:15.750
Telegram, madame.

01:20:24.458 --> 01:20:25.375
Interesting?

01:20:26.833 --> 01:20:30.041
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has seen fit to.

01:20:30.208 --> 01:20:31.625
I have been awarded,

01:20:32.208 --> 01:20:33.875
the nobel prize again.

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:35.666
This time for chemistry.

01:20:35.958 --> 01:20:37.208
For what?

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:39.916
For my extraction of the elements,

01:20:40.083 --> 01:20:41.458
Radium and Polonium.

01:20:41.625 --> 01:20:43.000
Congratulations, mother.

01:20:44.291 --> 01:20:48.208
And they suggested that I do not come,
to avoid unncessary controversy.

01:20:50.666 --> 01:20:51.750
Well.

01:20:56.625 --> 01:20:58.625
Let me measure your head, Ève.

01:21:00.708 --> 01:21:02.041
Come here, sweetie.

01:21:29.958 --> 01:21:33.208
We were so pleased you were able to
make it to Sweden, Mrs Curie.

01:21:33.875 --> 01:21:34.916
Were you?

01:21:35.291 --> 01:21:36.333
Oh yes.

01:21:37.333 --> 01:21:38.833
The women's movement in stockholm,

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.625
supported you with great strength and conviction.

01:21:44.125 --> 01:21:45.458
Have you all that you need?

01:21:57.125 --> 01:21:58.333
Yes, I have.

01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:00.541
Everything I need.

01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:06.958
They don't like you here.

01:22:07.125 --> 01:22:08.166
Nonsense!

01:22:09.125 --> 01:22:12.458
They are merely having a hard time seperating,
my scientific life,

01:22:12.625 --> 01:22:14.166
from my personal life.

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:17.833
Why don't they like your personal life?

01:22:20.375 --> 01:22:23.208
What will you talk of in your speech?

01:22:23.916 --> 01:22:25.083
Personal things?

01:22:25.458 --> 01:22:26.333
No.

01:22:28.666 --> 01:22:30.833
The chemistry of the imponderable.

01:23:34.291 --> 01:23:36.125
Some 15 years ago,

01:23:36.666 --> 01:23:40.416
The radiation of Uraninum was discovered by Henri Becquerel.

01:23:41.708 --> 01:23:44.375
and 2 years later, the study of this phenomenon,

01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:47.208
was extented to other substances.

01:23:47.375 --> 01:23:48.666
First by me,

01:23:50.416 --> 01:23:52.208
and then by Pierre Curie.

01:24:00.041 --> 01:24:01.041
and myself.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.125
<i>The study rapidly led us to the discovery of</i>

01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:08.500
<i>new elements</i>

01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:12.316
<i>the radiation of which, while being analogous 
to that of uranium,</i>

01:24:13.458 --> 01:24:15.500
<i>was far more intense.</i>

01:24:20.125 --> 01:24:21.791
<i>Thanks to this discovery</i>

01:24:21.958 --> 01:24:25.500
<i>of new very powerful radioactive substances</i>

01:24:25.958 --> 01:24:27.916
<i>The study of radioactivity</i>

01:24:28.625 --> 01:24:31.250
<i>progresses with marvellous rapidity.</i>

01:24:45.208 --> 01:24:46.666
Irène, where are you taking me?

01:24:46.833 --> 01:24:48.416
Wait and see mama.

01:24:52.541 --> 01:24:53.541
Stop here driver.

01:25:00.291 --> 01:25:01.875
- Irène, I won't...
- I know.

01:25:02.041 --> 01:25:03.833
- Then why am I here?
- Cause you need to see it.

01:25:07.708 --> 01:25:09.333
Do you think the warriors are seperate to you?

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:10.625
Of cos it is.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.666
You think you can't help?

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:15.416
Irene, I am ill, I am female.

01:25:15.583 --> 01:25:18.833
I can't see myself being much useful to anyone.
But give me a gun and I will try.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.458
This country is at war,

01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:22.333
and the medical services are a disaster.

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.666
I won't go inside your hospital.

01:25:26.458 --> 01:25:27.666
I know, mother.

01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:31.000
So I am bringing it outside to you.

01:25:53.625 --> 01:25:54.416
This is Frank.

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.491
Hello, Frank.

01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:58.666
He has both his legs amputated.

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.991
This is Pascal.

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:03.591
Hello, Pascal.

01:26:04.583 --> 01:26:06.791
He has both his arms amputated.

01:26:07.791 --> 01:26:09.333
And this is Gabriel.

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:10.416
Irène.

01:26:15.666 --> 01:26:18.125
I want to look at them like exhibits in a museum.

01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:21.500
They are chopping these boys up.
They don't have absurdities to do otherwise.

01:26:21.666 --> 01:26:22.708
It's tragic.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
What do you want me to do about it?

01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:27.208
You're Marie Curie.

01:26:28.625 --> 01:26:31.125
It's time to make this war your war.

01:26:32.041 --> 01:26:33.125
Please.

01:26:41.333 --> 01:26:43.243
As senior science minister in the government, 

01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:44.458
I must tell you.

01:26:44.625 --> 01:26:46.208
Young boys are dying.

01:26:46.375 --> 01:26:47.708
As senior scientist minister.

01:26:47.875 --> 01:26:48.833
Science. Science minister.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.583
My apologies.
Senior science minister.

01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:54.416
I see your sense of superiority,
you take with you. 

01:26:54.583 --> 01:26:56.875
Professor Lippmann, you have never liked me.

01:26:57.041 --> 01:26:58.875
It's not a question of liking or disliking.

01:26:59.041 --> 01:27:01.666
Quite, it's a question of respect, and you have respect me.

01:27:01.833 --> 01:27:05.166
Now, with the mobile radiography unit, we can be x-raying troops,

01:27:05.333 --> 01:27:08.291
before deciding whether they need amputation,
surely you can see.

01:27:08.458 --> 01:27:09.791
Madam Curie, all I can see is,

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:12.916
impractical measure proposed by a women I know 
to be eminently practical.

01:27:13.083 --> 01:27:15.916
I need funds, I need access, I need the ability,

01:27:16.083 --> 01:27:18.958
to go out on the battlefield, you must grant me.

01:27:19.125 --> 01:27:20.583
Why must I do that?

01:27:21.125 --> 01:27:23.875
Partly because it is right,
partly because I am needed.

01:27:24.041 --> 01:27:26.333
But mostly, mostly because I am sick,

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:28.208
and tired, I cough blood most night.

01:27:28.375 --> 01:27:30.291
and this is my last fight.

01:27:30.708 --> 01:27:32.208
And I will win it.

01:27:33.833 --> 01:27:35.666
We are both tired, Madam Curie.

01:27:52.458 --> 01:27:56.125
Mother, if you can look at him like he hasn't done 
your personal front I greatly appreciate it.

01:27:56.291 --> 01:27:58.208
- I don't mind.
- Of cos you do.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.166
Because you won't say, your well mannered. 

01:28:02.416 --> 01:28:06.141
But mother isn't so fierce, that she can't 
adjust her behaviour.

01:28:06.416 --> 01:28:08.291
- You have a PhD?
- This isn't a job interview.

01:28:08.458 --> 01:28:09.416
Do you have a PhD?

01:28:09.583 --> 01:28:10.875
Shut up, Ève !

01:28:11.041 --> 01:28:13.125
I do, I do have a PhD.

01:28:13.291 --> 01:28:14.791
- And your thesis was on?
- Mother!

01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:18.700
Mr Joliot, do you have interesting observation 
to make about the weather,

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.875
about the political system, about the transport system?

01:28:22.116 --> 01:28:22.975
No.

01:28:23.708 --> 01:28:24.916
Do you love science?

01:28:27.041 --> 01:28:28.583
Of cos I love science.

01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:30.250
I love your daughter,

01:28:31.291 --> 01:28:32.375
and I love science.

01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:33.958
He loves your daughter.

01:28:34.625 --> 01:28:37.291
Let us take your love for my daughter as read,
and talk of science.

01:28:38.791 --> 01:28:40.125
I would love to.

01:28:40.416 --> 01:28:41.583
You are impossible.

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:44.333
So tell me what you have been working on, Mr Joliot?

01:28:45.208 --> 01:28:47.291
I have been working with Irène actually.

01:28:47.916 --> 01:28:51.208
We have been working with the belief 
that maybe radioactivity,

01:28:51.375 --> 01:28:53.416
can be taken a few steps further. 

01:28:54.041 --> 01:28:55.208
Can it now?

01:28:56.333 --> 01:28:57.500
Carry on.

01:28:57.958 --> 01:29:01.125
In those atoms where radioactivity doesn't naturally occur,

01:29:01.291 --> 01:29:03.833
maybe it can be induced.

01:29:04.291 --> 01:29:05.833
What have you been working with?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.333
Lighter elements, Boron and Aluminum. 

01:29:08.791 --> 01:29:10.666
We are bombarding them with alpha particles,

01:29:10.833 --> 01:29:13.041
and getting readings after we stopped.

01:29:13.458 --> 01:29:14.666
If we can show the reaction..

01:29:14.833 --> 01:29:18.166
Then you would have shown the possibility of
artificial radiation. 

01:29:22.208 --> 01:29:23.666
This is exciting work. 

01:29:24.583 --> 01:29:26.041
I think so too.

01:29:28.541 --> 01:29:29.541
You think we like him?

01:30:40.833 --> 01:30:42.625
I will get those ambulances.

01:30:43.083 --> 01:30:45.541
And I will outfit them, and I will get them ready.

01:30:46.916 --> 01:30:48.583
But I won't work on them.

01:30:49.875 --> 01:30:52.125
And I don't want you to either.

01:30:53.458 --> 01:30:56.375
Death is not good for a young person to see.

01:30:58.958 --> 01:31:01.333
And I don't think you should be involved with Frederic's work.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.458
As exciting as it seems, radiation is not safe.

01:31:08.083 --> 01:31:09.583
And, in fact I want you to stay away from him.

01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:11.000
But you spend your entire life..

01:31:11.166 --> 01:31:14.041
life surrounded by death in radiation yes, and

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.833
they brought me very little happiness.

01:31:21.416 --> 01:31:22.958
I want better for you.

01:31:33.375 --> 01:31:34.500
Night night.

01:31:44.458 --> 01:31:45.750
Madam Curie.

01:31:47.708 --> 01:31:49.083
Mademoiselle Curie.

01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:52.958
What an honour to see you,

01:31:53.125 --> 01:31:54.708
to grace me with your presence.

01:32:05.041 --> 01:32:07.125
Your exploits are a credit to France, Madam.

01:32:11.125 --> 01:32:12.625
We are here to ask for funds.

01:32:13.075 --> 01:32:16.916
Ah yes, Professeur Lippmann has explained to me in 
your situation.

01:32:17.083 --> 01:32:18.000
I am afraid,

01:32:18.458 --> 01:32:20.916
your request for funds cannot be granted.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.708
Consider these as part payment.

01:32:33.916 --> 01:32:35.750
Melt them down and use them for war effort.

01:32:35.916 --> 01:32:39.208
- But these are your Nobel prizes.
- And they are made from pure gold.

01:32:40.041 --> 01:32:41.625
It is a start don't you think?

01:32:44.066 --> 01:32:47.291
Madam Curie, these prizes are a pride of France,
I will not..

01:32:47.458 --> 01:32:50.791
These prizes are the results of pain, and they
seem to have caused pain

01:32:50.958 --> 01:32:54.625
and I would rather they be use for something useful like 
curing others from pain.

01:32:57.333 --> 01:32:58.083
Well I think..

01:32:58.250 --> 01:33:00.708
Boys are having their legs sawn off,

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:02.541
because of sprained ankles.

01:33:02.708 --> 01:33:06.041
My X-ray machines properly installed can save lives.

01:33:06.375 --> 01:33:08.958
We will also use Radon radiation to cauterize wounds,

01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:10.208
that is quick, efficient,

01:33:11.166 --> 01:33:12.833
and can stop blood loss.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.291
Our proposal,

01:33:15.333 --> 01:33:17.166
will give you more men on your battlefield.

01:33:17.333 --> 01:33:18.916
But Radon is a gas, Madam Curie.

01:33:19.083 --> 01:33:19.958
I am perfectly aware of that.

01:33:20.125 --> 01:33:22.125
And that's why we will use bulbs.

01:33:22.458 --> 01:33:23.833
Radon bulbs.

01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:28.041
The minister of war has made his position clear.

01:33:28.208 --> 01:33:29.500
Then let me make mine clear.

01:33:31.625 --> 01:33:33.125
I will go to the press.

01:33:33.583 --> 01:33:36.000
I will offer them my Nobel prize metal.

01:33:36.583 --> 01:33:38.250
I will give them the same ultimatum.

01:33:39.041 --> 01:33:41.875
- The press?
- I know perfectly well what the press is capable of.

01:33:42.041 --> 01:33:44.850
And I believe I have learnt how to use it to my advantage.

01:33:46.166 --> 01:33:47.291
Now,

01:33:47.541 --> 01:33:50.666
will you please give me my X-rays machines and ambulances?

01:34:02.791 --> 01:34:04.083
Your quite the competent driver.

01:34:04.541 --> 01:34:05.708
Who taught you?

01:34:06.583 --> 01:34:07.750
I learnt.

01:34:10.333 --> 01:34:12.458
I wasn't much of a mother was I?

01:34:13.875 --> 01:34:16.375
What does that have to do with anything right now?

01:34:16.833 --> 01:34:18.375
I am very proud of you.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.083
Thank you.

01:34:21.541 --> 01:34:23.291
I am very proud of you too.

01:34:24.083 --> 01:34:25.708
Must have been so difficult.

01:34:26.458 --> 01:34:28.291
Being a women and doing all that you did.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.625
Believe my love, I suffered much more from,

01:34:31.791 --> 01:34:35.208
lack of resources and funds, than I ever did from being a woman. 

01:34:35.958 --> 01:34:38.875
Now, are you still working with Frederic, on his
artificial radiation theory?

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:42.333
It's not his theory.

01:34:42.958 --> 01:34:44.250
It's ours.

01:34:45.166 --> 01:34:47.708
And of cos I am still working with Frederic.

01:34:49.625 --> 01:34:51.750
Now, can we concentrate on the matter at hand.

01:34:51.958 --> 01:34:53.291
Absolutely.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Mum.

01:34:58.375 --> 01:35:00.791
Help me with this, it's very heavy.

01:35:03.958 --> 01:35:05.375
Now if you check the bulb.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.666
Be careful, it's delicate.

01:35:13.166 --> 01:35:15.625
There's been a fire, we need everyone,
quickly now. 

01:35:15.791 --> 01:35:17.250
We are just outfitting this, unload.

01:35:18.125 --> 01:35:21.208
You don't understand we need everyone, 
get in the van. Help.

01:35:22.125 --> 01:35:24.375
Mother, the time is come.

01:35:44.708 --> 01:35:45.625
A red ribbon for him?

01:35:45.791 --> 01:35:48.125
We have to make rational decisions about who
we can save. 

01:35:48.291 --> 01:35:49.708
They say they can't save him.

01:35:49.875 --> 01:35:51.125
What do you think?

01:35:51.291 --> 01:35:52.208
What?

01:35:52.625 --> 01:35:55.300
Irene, your only 18 years old, but you are the
most capable doctor here,

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:56.833
What do you think?

01:36:00.166 --> 01:36:01.291
I think we should take him to the hospital.

01:37:23.458 --> 01:37:24.541
<i>Maria...</i>

01:37:25.666 --> 01:37:26.875
<i>Are you frightened?</i>

01:39:53.458 --> 01:39:54.750
Water.

01:39:55.958 --> 01:39:57.208
Sorry?

01:40:00.791 --> 01:40:02.166
Would you like some water?

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:07.208
I hate hospitals.

01:40:08.083 --> 01:40:09.125
I know.

01:40:10.666 --> 01:40:13.208
I had to say goodbye to my mother in a hospital.

01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:16.875
I know.

01:40:19.083 --> 01:40:22.416
So I plan a way of making people better from outside
of the hospital.

01:40:24.250 --> 01:40:25.541
You did.

01:40:26.916 --> 01:40:28.416
I did, didn't I?

01:40:29.791 --> 01:40:31.041
Didn't I?

01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:35.791
I think we should leave here, don't you?

01:40:36.875 --> 01:40:38.958
No, there is too much to do.

01:40:47.833 --> 01:40:49.958
Let us stop by leaving the hospital.

01:40:56.083 --> 01:40:58.458
I used to have such beautiful hands.

01:40:58.875 --> 01:41:01.333
Now the radiation has crippled your bones.

01:41:03.708 --> 01:41:07.083
The things that makes us weak, is the things that
makes us strong.

01:41:07.291 --> 01:41:09.875
- I didn't make you weak.
- Of cos you did.

01:41:10.666 --> 01:41:13.708
But I couldn't have done what we couldn't
what we did without each other.

01:41:13.875 --> 01:41:15.916
No, you did the extraordinary.

01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:17.625
You changed the world.

01:41:18.208 --> 01:41:19.500
In the right way.

01:41:20.083 --> 01:41:22.583
I rather be someone that hopes the world
be full of light,

01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:24.625
and fills the darkness out there, wouldn't you?

01:41:25.375 --> 01:41:27.291
You throw stones down in the water,

01:41:27.875 --> 01:41:29.916
the ripples you can't control.

01:41:31.833 --> 01:41:34.166
There are things to be scared of but,

01:41:35.791 --> 01:41:37.708
there is so much to celebrate.

01:41:38.791 --> 01:41:40.458
I hope you're right.

01:41:43.833 --> 01:41:45.625
I hope you're right.
