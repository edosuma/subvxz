WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.753
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i> IS RECORDED

00:03.836 --> 00:05.547
IN FRONT OF A
LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.630 --> 00:08.090
- AND SO AN ENDANGERED SPECIES

00:08.173 --> 00:10.135
TEETERS ON THE BRINK
OF EXTINCTION,

00:10.218 --> 00:14.431
ALL BECAUSE TWO
AFRICAN BLACK RHINOS,

00:14.514 --> 00:16.224
MOSES AND CLEMENTINE,

00:16.306 --> 00:22.272
REFUSE...
TO MAKE LOVE.

00:22.355 --> 00:25.316
OH, CLEMENTINE IS WILLING,
BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR HER,

00:25.400 --> 00:31.489
THE ONLY THING HORNY
ABOUT MOSES IS HIS FACE.

00:31.573 --> 00:34.492
REPORTING FROM THE RHINO BARN
AT THE CLEVELAND ZOO,

00:34.576 --> 00:39.372
I AM A DEVASTATED
VICTORIA CHASE.

00:40.665 --> 00:43.251
AND OUT.

00:43.334 --> 00:44.669
WELL, IF THAT DOESN'T
WIN ME A NEWSIE,

00:44.753 --> 00:46.421
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.

00:46.504 --> 00:51.176
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT AWARDS,
IT'S ABOUT SAVING A SPECIES.

00:51.259 --> 00:53.636
- OH, ELKA, IT'S NOT
THAT I DON'T CARE.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.805
OR MAYBE IT IS.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.474
BUT IF ALL THE BLACK RHINOS
DISAPPEARED TOMORROW,

00:57.557 --> 00:59.100
WOULD ANYBODY REALLY NOTICE?

00:59.184 --> 01:02.645
I MEAN, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY
EXISTED UNTIL 20 MINUTES AGO.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.607
- VICTORIA, I FOUND THE GLYCERIN
FOR YOUR FAKE TEARS.

01:05.690 --> 01:06.566
- IT'S TOO LATE, JOY.

01:06.649 --> 01:10.153
I WAS FORCED TO CRY
REAL TEARS ON CAMERA.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.405
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO GO AND REMOVE

01:12.489 --> 01:14.824
THE TWO CLOTHESPINS
CLAMPED TO THE TENDER FLESH

01:14.908 --> 01:17.452
OF MY INNER THIGHS.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.958
- THAT'S THE RHINO MATING
SONG.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.960
- MOSES IS AROUSED.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.253
- REALLY?
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

01:27.337 --> 01:29.005
WHOA!

01:29.088 --> 01:31.841
RUN, CLEMENTINE, RUN!

01:31.925 --> 01:35.637
- BUT WHY IS HE AROUSED NOW?
WHAT'S CHANGED?

01:38.598 --> 01:41.184
- IT'S JOY.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.185
- [sniffs]
YOU ARE EXUDING

01:42.268 --> 01:43.394
A POWERFUL MUSK.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.522
- MUSK? ME?
NO.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.232
MAYBE A LITTLE GARLIC,
HAD SCAMPI LAST NIGHT.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.651
- HANG ON, HANG ON.

01:49.734 --> 01:52.654
THIS MIGHT BE AN EVEN BETTER
STORY FOR MY NEWSIE VOTERS.

01:52.737 --> 01:56.157
"FROM ACROSS THE POND,
A SMELLY SAVIOR

01:56.241 --> 02:00.203
HAS THESE RHINOS LITERALLY
HUMPING FOR JOY."

02:00.286 --> 02:02.330
- WHAT?
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT!

02:02.413 --> 02:05.834
- AND IN THREE, TWO, ONE...

02:05.917 --> 02:08.169
- WAIT.
MOSES HAS STOPPED MATING.

02:08.252 --> 02:12.257
HIS EPIDIDYMIS
IS SHRIVELING.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.094
ELKA, WOULD YOU
COME OVER HERE

02:16.177 --> 02:20.890
AND STAND NEXT TO JOY,
PLEASE?

02:20.974 --> 02:23.226
[rhino groans]

02:23.309 --> 02:24.394
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.020
IT'S THE MIXTURE OF YOUR
PHEROMONES

02:26.104 --> 02:27.063
THAT'S TURNING HIM ON.

02:27.146 --> 02:30.400
THIS IS FANTASTIC.
THE BLACK RHINO COULD BE SAVED.

02:30.483 --> 02:31.943
- THAT'S NICE.
CAN WE GO NOW?

02:32.026 --> 02:33.570
- NO, NO, NO,
YOU CAN'T LEAVE

02:33.653 --> 02:35.405
UNTIL THE MATING
RITUAL'S COMPLETE.

02:35.488 --> 02:38.575
- USUALLY I'M THE ONE
SAYING THAT.

02:38.658 --> 02:39.617
- STAY, I BEG YOU.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.578
I'M WILLING TO OFFER YOU
A FREE ZOO MEMBERSHIP

02:41.661 --> 02:42.954
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

02:43.037 --> 02:45.540
- AND YOU'LL GET A
VOLUNTEER OUTFIT LIKE MINE.

02:45.623 --> 02:46.791
- NOT HELPING.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.252
- OH, PLEASE, JOY.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.880
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

02:51.963 --> 02:55.049
BY THE LOOKS OF IT,
MOSES WILL BE DONE SOON ANYWAY.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.594
HE'LL PROBABLY BE DRESSED, GONE,
AND ENJOYING A PINT

02:57.677 --> 02:59.762
WITH HIS MATES BEFORE
CLEMENTINE CAN EVEN FIND

02:59.846 --> 03:02.432
THE BALLED-UP SILK GARTER BELT
HE NEVER EVEN NOTICED

03:02.515 --> 03:04.100
SHE WAS WEARING.

03:04.183 --> 03:06.895
[laughs]

03:06.978 --> 03:08.938
- ACTUALLY, JOY, THE BLACK
RHINO'S MATING PROCESS

03:09.022 --> 03:10.231
IS QUITE COMPLEX.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.482
IT LASTS THREE DAYS.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.443
- THREE DAYS?

03:13.526 --> 03:15.486
WE'RE GOING TO SPEND
THREE DAYS IN A ZOO?

03:15.570 --> 03:19.490
- IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.293
- SO ELKA AND JOY
HAVE TO SLEEP IN A CAGE?

03:30.376 --> 03:32.086
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
THE ZOO PUT TOGETHER

03:32.170 --> 03:35.965
A LITTLE MAKESHIFT HABITAT
WITH COTS, AND BLANKETS, AND--

03:36.049 --> 03:38.468
I DON'T KNOW.
I LEFT.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.428
- WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO VISIT THEM.

03:40.511 --> 03:41.429
- MM.
- THEN AGAIN,

03:41.512 --> 03:42.972
IT IS FRIDAY NIGHT.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.515
- AND WE DO LOOK FABULOUS.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.560
- AND WE ARE FRESHLY BOTOX-ED.
I SAY WE GO FISHIN'!

03:47.644 --> 03:49.270
- [laughs]

03:49.354 --> 03:51.314
OOH,
THOSE TWO LOOK LIKE

03:51.397 --> 03:55.151
THEY COULD BE
HOOKED AND MOUNTED.

03:55.234 --> 03:57.779
- WE JUST NEED TO DECIDE
WHICH BAIT TO USE:

03:57.862 --> 04:01.699
THE "SIP AND SMILE"...

04:01.783 --> 04:06.412
- OR HOW ABOUT THE "HAIR FLIP
FOLLOWED BY A SILVERY LAUGH"?

04:06.496 --> 04:08.665
[laughs]

04:08.748 --> 04:11.376
- PERFECT.
NOW TOGETHER.

04:11.459 --> 04:14.504
[both laugh]

04:14.587 --> 04:16.505
OOH, THEY'RE BITING.

04:16.589 --> 04:22.136
NOW WE JUST HAVE
TO CLEAN 'EM, AND BONE 'EM.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.348
I SWEAR THAT SOUNDED
CUTER IN MY HEAD.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.183
- I KNOW.

04:27.266 --> 04:30.353
HEY, DIBS ON THE ONE
IN THE IRONIC WORK SHIRT.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.356
LOOK AT HIS ARMS.
HE IS SO MY TYPE.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.024
- YOU CAN'T CALL DIBS,
VICTORIA.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.734
WHAT IF THEY'VE ALREADY
CALLED DIBS ON ONE OF US?

04:36.818 --> 04:38.695
- NO, BUT GIRL DIBS
SUPERSEDE MAN DIBS.

04:38.778 --> 04:39.862
MEN AREN'T DISCRIMINATING,

04:39.946 --> 04:42.031
THEY'LL TAKE WHATEVER
WE GIVE THEM.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.366
- THAT'S TRUE.

04:43.449 --> 04:47.370
- OH. OH, NO.
HOW MUCH DID YOU HEAR?

04:47.453 --> 04:53.042
- NOT MUCH.
SO, "FRESHLY BOTOX-ED" HUH?

04:53.126 --> 04:57.171
[both laugh]

04:57.255 --> 05:00.341
[rhinos grunting]

05:11.227 --> 05:13.521
- YOU KNOW, JOY,
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME

05:13.604 --> 05:17.900
YOU AND I HAVE BEEN
BEHIND BARS TOGETHER.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.318
- I KNOW.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.738
AND I SUPPOSE JAIL
WAS WORSE THAN THIS.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.698
AT LEAST HERE, THEY DIDN'T
CONFISCATE MY BELT,

05:23.781 --> 05:28.077
SO I STILL HAVE THE OPTION OF
HANGING MYSELF.

05:28.161 --> 05:32.415
[monkey squealing]

05:32.498 --> 05:35.376
- [mimics monkey]

05:35.460 --> 05:37.295
- WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU DOING?

05:37.378 --> 05:40.757
- SHH, I'M TALKING.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.759
- LOOK, ELKA, I KNOW YOU
CONSIDER YOURSELF SOME SORT OF

05:42.842 --> 05:44.427
DR. DOLITTLE,
BUT YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY

05:44.510 --> 05:45.887
EXPECT THEM TO RESPOND.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.056
[excited monkey squeals]

05:48.139 --> 05:51.934
- THAT'S MOKOLO,
OUR PYGMY CHIMPANZEE.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.936
THAT'S HIS CRY OF FRIENDSHIP.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.064
[monkey squeals]

05:56.147 --> 06:01.444
HE'S INVITING US OVER.

06:01.527 --> 06:06.783
TO PICK THE NITS
OUT OF EACH OTHER'S HAIR.

06:06.866 --> 06:11.746
OH, HE HAS THE MOST
COLORFUL BEHIND.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.956
- DOES HE HAVE A BROTHER?

06:17.251 --> 06:19.253
- WOW, A TRIATHLETE, HUH?

06:19.337 --> 06:21.172
- WELL, I DON'T LIKE
TO BRAG, BUT YES.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.341
AND I'M ALSO TRAINING
FOR THE IRON MAN.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.468
PRETTY GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING.
SO I GUESS I DO LIKE TO BRAG.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.970
[laughter]

06:28.054 --> 06:29.263
I'M ALSO IN A JAZZ BAND.
WE'RE PLAYING TOMORROW NIGHT,

06:29.347 --> 06:30.473
IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.433
- IT'S A DATE.
- OH, GOOD.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.935
I'M ALWAYS TRYING
TO GET SCOTT HERE TO COME,

06:34.018 --> 06:36.813
BUT "THE SENATOR" HERE
IS ALWAYS TOO BUSY.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.816
- SENATOR?

06:39.899 --> 06:41.692
YOU'RE AN ACTUAL SENATOR?

06:41.776 --> 06:44.570
- A STATE SENATOR,
39TH DISTRICT, FOUR TERM.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.323
- WELL, SERVING ON
THE STATE LEVEL FOR SO LONG,

06:47.406 --> 06:49.992
YOU MUST HAVE SOME
NATIONAL ASPIRATIONS.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.286
- OH, HO, HO, HO, YOU MEAN
THE AMERICAN PRESIDENCY?

06:52.370 --> 06:55.832
[all laugh]
YES, THAT'S THE PLAN.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.167
- AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

06:58.251 --> 07:00.294
WHILE I ADORE THE "BUDDY"
NAME PATCH

07:00.378 --> 07:02.964
ON YOUR IRONIC
WORK SHIRT, I REALIZE

07:03.047 --> 07:04.173
I STILL DON'T KNOW
YOUR REAL NAME.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.510
- [laughs]
IT'S BUDDY.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.513
THAT'S MY REAL NAME.
AND THIS IS A REAL WORK SHIRT.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.014
I'M A JANITOR.
- OH!

07:12.098 --> 07:16.477
- OH, OH.
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.284
- I'M STARVING.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.870
WHY WON'T THE ZOO FEED US
LIKE THE OTHER ANIMALS?

07:33.953 --> 07:38.082
- I ALWAYS KEEP A SLEEVE OF
FIG NEWTONS IN MY PURSE.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.918
I'D HAVE OFFERED YOU ONE,
BUT--WELL, YOU KNOW.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.086
- WHAT?

07:42.170 --> 07:45.715
- I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.176
- HI, YOU GUYS!
OH, ISN'T THIS INCREDIBLE?

07:48.259 --> 07:51.053
THE TWO OF YOU LIVING HERE,
SAVING A SPECIES.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.514
AND SPEAKING OF DATING
A SENATOR, GUESS WHO IS!

07:53.598 --> 07:55.892
ME!
A SENATOR!

07:55.975 --> 07:57.351
- OH, WOW.

07:57.435 --> 08:02.273
- AND I'M DATING A SEXY
TRIATHLETE/JAZZ MUSICIAN.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.941
- AND?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:04.025 --> 08:05.234
- I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU
DESCRIBE A MAN

08:05.318 --> 08:06.736
AND NOT INCLUDE HIS NET WORTH.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.197
- WELL, MAYBE I'VE CHANGED.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.242
OR MAYBE I'M DATING
A JANITOR.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.037
- VICTORIA, THERE'S NO SHAME
IN DATING A JANITOR.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.748
HIS BEST FRIEND IS A SENATOR,
WHO I'M DATING!

08:18.831 --> 08:20.124
- YEAH, WELL HOW GREAT
CAN HE BE

08:20.208 --> 08:23.628
IF HIS BEST FRIEND
IS A JANITOR, WHO I'M DATING?

08:23.711 --> 08:27.048
WHERE DID I THINK
I WAS GOING WITH THAT?

08:27.131 --> 08:31.594
- OH, SCOTT AND I STAYED UP ALL
NIGHT LAUGHING AND TALKING.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.763
I REALLY THINK THIS
COULD GO SOMEWHERE.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.097
LISTEN TO THE TEXT
HE SENT ME THIS MORNING.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.892
"MELANIE,
LAST NIGHT WAS AMAZING.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.102
I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT YOUR SMILE."

08:40.186 --> 08:42.563
- AW, THAT IS SWEET.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.941
THE ONLY NEXT MORNING TEXT
I EVER GOT WAS,

08:45.024 --> 08:47.735
"YOU MIGHT WANT
TO SEE A DOCTOR."

08:53.157 --> 08:56.244
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S
DELIGHTFUL ABOUT BUDDY?

08:56.327 --> 08:58.663
HE JINGLES WHEN HE WALKS.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.456
- LOTS OF KEYS, HUH?

09:00.539 --> 09:04.126
- LIKE A HUNDRED.
I CAN'T DATE HIM.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.461
YOU KNOW,
WHICH IS A SHAME REALLY,

09:05.544 --> 09:07.463
BECAUSE HE'S ACTUALLY
VERY NICE,

09:07.546 --> 09:12.093
AND INTERESTING,
AND WELL-READ.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.637
- SO, YOU CAN'T DATE HIM
BECAUSE YOU'RE A SNOB.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.474
- NO!
BECAUSE HE'S ONLY A JANITOR.

09:18.557 --> 09:19.809
WOW.

09:19.892 --> 09:23.396
EVEN I DIDN'T LIKE MYSELF
WHEN I SAID THAT.

09:23.479 --> 09:24.313
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.482
I AM GOING TO FORGET
ABOUT WHAT HE DOES,

09:26.565 --> 09:29.193
AND CONCENTRATE ON WHO HE IS.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.320
I SAID THAT LINE IN
THE LIFETIME ORIGINAL MOVIE,

09:31.404 --> 09:33.823
"THE PRINCESS
AND THE PLUMBER."

09:33.906 --> 09:39.787
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT,
BUT NOW I DO.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.331
[phone beeps]
- OH, IT'S FROM SCOTT AGAIN.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.834
THIS TIME HE SENT A PHOTO.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.129
OH! NO, NO, NO, NO,
PLEASE TELL ME THAT'S NOT

09:48.212 --> 09:49.130
WHAT I THINK IT IS.

09:49.213 --> 09:53.259
- YEP, THAT'S HIS EPIDIDYMIS.

09:53.342 --> 09:54.635
- OH, IT'S JUST LIKE
BRETT FAVRE,

09:54.719 --> 09:57.388
OR THAT CONGRESSMAN
ANTHONY WEINER.

09:57.471 --> 10:02.184
- OH, MY GOD,
I'VE BEEN WEINER-ED.

10:02.268 --> 10:05.855
- WHAT IS IT WITH MEN TEXTING
PICTURES OF THEIR PRIVATE PARTS?

10:05.938 --> 10:07.523
- WELL, YOU KNOW HOW MEN
ALL LIKE THEIR GADGETS,

10:07.606 --> 10:08.691
AND THEIR PRIVATE PARTS.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.694
IT'S THE PERFECT STORM.

10:11.777 --> 10:16.240
[phone rings]
- OH, GROSS. IT'S HIM.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.200
HELLO, SENATOR.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.660
YES, YES, I GOT THE PHOTO,

10:19.744 --> 10:24.248
AND I MUST SAY,
I WAS SHOCKED AND OFFENDED.

10:24.332 --> 10:29.211
UH-HUH. OH, UH-HUH.
OH, OKAY.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.923
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.925
- YOU'RE GOING OUT
WITH HIM AGAIN?

10:35.009 --> 10:36.218
- IT WASN'T A PICTURE
OF SCOTT.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.386
HIS EMAIL GOT HACKED

10:37.470 --> 10:39.055
BY A POLITICAL OPPONENT.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.890
- AND YOU BELIEVE THAT?

10:40.973 --> 10:42.391
- I WANT TO.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.894
- WELL, JUST TO BE SURE,
DO WHAT I ALWAYS DO--

10:44.977 --> 10:46.729
SNAG HIS PHONE AND
SCROLL THROUGH HIS PHOTOS.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.898
- OH, I'M TERRIBLE
WITH THAT TECH STUFF.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.400
- WELL, AT LEAST THE JANITOR
WON'T BE TEXTING YOU

10:51.484 --> 10:53.861
DIRTY PICTURES.
- VERY AMUSING.

10:53.944 --> 10:58.199
- BECAUSE HE LIKES THINGS CLEAN.
- GOT IT.

10:58.282 --> 11:01.827
- BECAUSE HE'S A JANITOR.
- OH, SHUT UP!

11:03.788 --> 11:05.873
- MELANIE, LOOK
IN THE BACKGROUND,

11:05.956 --> 11:07.917
BEHIND YOUR SENATE
MEMBER'S MEMBER.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.920
- I TOLD YOU, IT'S NOT HIS.
OH, IS THAT--

11:11.003 --> 11:12.630
- IT'S AN IMPERIAL-SIZE TUB OF

11:12.713 --> 11:15.424
JEUX DE MANGE ANESSE
BEAUTY CREAM.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.593
- AN IMPERIAL WHAT?

11:17.676 --> 11:20.596
- $1,300 WORTH OF
THE MOST AGE-DEFYING,

11:20.679 --> 11:23.557
SKIN-REPLENISHING
MOISTURIZER ON THE PLANET.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.559
- MM-HMM.
- YOU'D BE MORE ATTRACTIVE

11:25.643 --> 11:29.230
TO MEN IF YOU JUST TAPED
$1,300 TO YOUR FACE.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.113
- AND THEN A WHOLE FIGHT
BROKE OUT ON THE SENATE FLOOR.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.448
AND I REALIZED
THE WORLD IS DIVIDED

11:39.532 --> 11:41.242
INTO TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE--

11:41.325 --> 11:46.622
THOSE WHO LOVE MARSHMALLOW
PEEPS, AND THOSE WHO DON'T.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.207
- AND WHERE DO YOU STAND,
SENATOR?

11:48.290 --> 11:50.209
- WELL, I AM UP FOR REELECTION,
SO I DON'T REALLY

11:50.292 --> 11:52.294
FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING DOWN
ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.921
[both laugh]

11:54.004 --> 11:55.965
{\an1}- DON'T YOU EVER GET SICK OF NOT
BEING ABLE TO HAVE AN OPINION?

11:56.048 --> 11:59.593
- YES. AND NO.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.804
BUT, SERIOUSLY,
PEEPS ARE DISGUSTING.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.347
[both laugh]
- I HATE TO DO THIS TO YOU,

12:03.431 --> 12:04.181
BUT I'M GETTING
A LITTLE CHILLY OUT HERE,

12:04.265 --> 12:06.308
AND I LEFT MY SWEATER
IN YOUR CAR.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.018
- I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.693
- OH, THANK YOU.
OH, HERE, LET ME MOVE THAT.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.207
[phone ringing]

12:30.291 --> 12:32.126
- HELLO?

12:32.209 --> 12:33.961
- JOY, OKAY, I HAVE HIS PHONE.

12:34.044 --> 12:37.965
- PRESS "SETTINGS,"
THEN "FOLDERS."

12:38.048 --> 12:39.550
DO YOU SEE A FOLDER
MARKED "PHOTOS"?

12:39.633 --> 12:40.968
- YES.
- HIGHLIGHT IT,

12:41.051 --> 12:44.221
THEN PRESS "ENTER."
- I'M IN, I'M IN.

12:44.305 --> 12:48.017
OKAY, I'M SEARCHING, AND
I'M SEARCHING, SEARCHING,

12:48.100 --> 12:50.186
AND THERE'S NOTHING HERE.
THIS PHONE IS WIENER-FREE!

12:50.269 --> 12:51.812
- EXCELLENT.

12:51.896 --> 12:54.482
- OKAY, HE'S GOING TO BE BACK
ANY MINUTE, SO I GOTTA GO.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.699
AH, HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.585
THEY BROUGHT YOUR SOUP.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.170
- LOOKS DELICIOUS.
- IT IS.

13:16.253 --> 13:20.007
DOES. HOW WOULD I KNOW?

13:21.842 --> 13:24.887
- MM. GOOD.

13:24.970 --> 13:29.058
[rhino growls over phone]

13:31.977 --> 13:33.562
- WELL--SOMEBODY'S HUNGRY.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.398
- YES.

13:36.482 --> 13:42.029
QUIET, YOU.

13:45.699 --> 13:48.744
- YOU ARE AN AMAZING KISSER.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.621
- THANKS.

13:50.704 --> 13:53.958
- OH.
- OH. OH, YOU SMELL GREAT.

13:54.041 --> 13:58.045
- OH, THANK YOU. IT'S
YVES ST. LAURENT, BABY DOLL.

13:58.128 --> 14:01.215
- NO.
- YES.

14:01.298 --> 14:04.426
- NO, I'M GETTING
BIODEGRADABLE SURFACTANT

14:04.510 --> 14:09.014
AND A LOVELY TOP NOTE OF APPLE
MANGO. IT'S GAIN, ISN'T IT?

14:11.308 --> 14:12.768
- WHAT'S GAIN?

14:12.851 --> 14:14.937
- YOUR DETERGENT.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.815
- WHAT'S DETERGENT?

14:17.898 --> 14:18.691
- I'M SORRY, THAT WAS WEIRD.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.777
I CAN IDENTIFY ANY
CLEANING PRODUCT.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.279
OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.948
- WELL, OF COURSE.
BECAUSE YOU'RE A JANITOR.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.616
WHICH I AM
PERFECTLY FINE WITH.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.077
- WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE?

14:30.160 --> 14:31.453
- WELL, ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT, YOU KNOW,

14:31.537 --> 14:33.122
IT'S VERY BIG OF ME
TO OVERLOOK WHAT YOU DO,

14:33.205 --> 14:35.624
AND NOT JUDGE IT.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.586
- WELL, I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT,
BECAUSE MY JOB IS WHAT I DO,

14:38.669 --> 14:40.629
BUT MY LIFE IS WHO I AM.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.299
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE
PLUMBER SAID TO ME IN

14:43.382 --> 14:45.467
<i>THE PRINCESS AND THE PLUMBER.</i>
ALTHOUGH HE TURNED OUT TO BE

14:45.551 --> 14:47.720
A SECRET PRINCE.
ARE--? DID--?

14:47.803 --> 14:49.638
- NOT A PRINCE.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.640
BUT I DID GO TO PRINCETON.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.476
- YOU WENT TO PRINCETON
AND YOU'RE A JANITOR?

14:54.560 --> 14:57.771
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH EDUCATION
FOR EDUCATION'S SAKE?

14:57.855 --> 15:00.691
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

15:00.774 --> 15:04.987
- LOOK, I ENJOY MY WORK,
BUT THEN I'M FREE TO READ,

15:05.070 --> 15:09.116
SEE FRIENDS, SPEND TIME WITH AN
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

15:09.199 --> 15:13.329
I'M LIVING A VERY HAPPY LIFE
ON MY OWN TERMS.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.997
DOES THAT SOUND SO BAD?

15:15.080 --> 15:18.334
- NO.
IT ACTUALLY SOUNDS GREAT.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.044
AND THERE IS PRECEDENT.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.171
YOU KNOW, CHER HAD
HER BAGEL BOY,

15:22.254 --> 15:24.131
ELIZABETH TAYLOR
HER CONSTRUCTION WORKER,

15:24.214 --> 15:25.674
AND MARILYN MONROE
HAD THAT WRITER.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.009
- MILLER.

15:27.092 --> 15:32.181
- NO, I'M--I'M PRETTY SURE
HE WAS A WRITER.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.683
- YOU'RE ADORABLE.

15:36.602 --> 15:40.856
- IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT THAT
JAZZ BAND THING MIGHT TAKE OFF?

15:40.939 --> 15:45.861
WHAT AM I SAYING? JAZZ.

15:45.944 --> 15:47.821
- WHY IS THIS SUCH
A BIG DEAL FOR YOU?

15:47.905 --> 15:50.074
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
OR--

15:50.157 --> 15:52.201
YEAH, I DO.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.913
MY DAD WAS A STAGE ACTOR, AND HE
AND MY MOTHER WERE CONSTANTLY

15:55.996 --> 15:59.875
FIGHTING OVER MONEY,
AND I SWORE THAT WHEN I GREW UP

15:59.958 --> 16:01.710
I WOULD ONLY BE WITH SOMEONE
WHO HAD SO MUCH MONEY

16:01.794 --> 16:03.712
THAT THERE WAS
JUST NO POSSIBILITY

16:03.796 --> 16:05.255
WE WOULD EVER FIGHT ABOUT IT.

16:05.339 --> 16:09.885
I GUESS THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN IN
THE BACK OF MY MIND, AND--

16:09.968 --> 16:14.390
WELL, IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT I'M PROUD OF.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.892
- SO YOU'RE LIKE BECKY SHARP
IN <i> VANITY FAIR.</i>

16:16.975 --> 16:22.064
- I ONLY READ
THE HOLLYWOOD ISSUE.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.941
I'M REALLY SORRY.

16:24.024 --> 16:27.403
- I UNDERSTAND.
IT'S TOO BAD, THOUGH.

16:27.486 --> 16:31.323
I ACTUALLY THINK WE MIGHT HAVE
HAD SOMETHING SPECIAL.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.911
- WAIT, I'M--I'M FEELING
CONFLICTED.

16:35.994 --> 16:37.579
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST, YOU KNOW,
KISS SOME MORE AND THEN--

16:37.663 --> 16:40.374
- GOODBYE, VICTORIA.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.178
GOODBYE.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.949
- GOT A LOT OF CANDLES
LIT OUT HERE.

17:14.031 --> 17:17.077
FEELS A LITTLE GIRLY
WITHOUT THE GIRL.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.787
- I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE.
DON'T START WITHOUT ME.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.623
- TOO LATE!

17:21.707 --> 17:23.666
JOKING.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.090
- JEUX DE MANGE ANESSE.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.641
[rhinos growling]

17:39.725 --> 17:43.479
- YOU CAN STOP COVERING YOUR
EARS NOW. THEY'RE DONE.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.647
- THANK GOD, WE CAN
GO HOME IN THE MORNING.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.691
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
EVER BEEN AN ENGLISH PERSON

17:47.775 --> 17:48.859
WHO'S LOOKING FORWARD
TO BRUSHING THEIR TEETH

17:48.942 --> 17:52.946
AS MUCH AS ME.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.949
- I'M SAD.
TONIGHT'S OUR LAST NIGHT.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.868
- I DON'T GET YOU, ELKA.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.870
WHAT IS IT WITH
YOU AND ANIMALS?

17:59.953 --> 18:01.538
- THEY WERE HERE FIRST.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.541
- WELL, SURE, BUT--
- AH, BUT NOTHING.

18:04.625 --> 18:10.422
WE HUNT THEM FOR SPORT, WE
DESTROY THEIR NATURAL HABITAT.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.509
SOMETIMES IT MAKES ME
EMBARRASSED TO WALK ERECT.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.677
- BUT YOU HELP ANIMALS.
THEY LOVE YOU.

18:15.761 --> 18:19.807
- THEY DON'T LOVE ME.
THEY--JUST LOVE.

18:19.890 --> 18:24.353
AND THAT LOVE IS THE PUREST,
MOST JOYOUS THING IN THE WORLD.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.939
- THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

18:27.022 --> 18:30.776
GOD, I'M STARVING.
ANY FIG NEWTONS LEFT?

18:30.859 --> 18:32.820
- SORRY.

18:32.903 --> 18:38.367
EAT THE PEANUTS
THOSE KIDS THREW AT YOU.

18:38.450 --> 18:42.579
- I AM NOT GOING TO EAT PEANUTS
OFF THE FLOOR OF THE ZOO.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.873
ALTHOUGH THAT ONE
LOOKS ALL RIGHT.

18:51.129 --> 18:52.756
- I'M VICTORIA CHASE AT THE
CHANNEL SEVEN NEWS DESK,

18:52.840 --> 18:53.924
AND HERE ARE THE STORIES
WE'RE WORKING ON.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.885
OHIO SENATOR SCOTT MCCLONEY
RESIGNED FROM OFFICE TODAY

18:56.969 --> 19:00.889
AS THREE MORE WOMEN CAME
FORWARD IN THE SEX TEXT SCANDAL.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.225
AND THERE'S HAPPY NEWS
AT THE CLEVELAND ZOO.

19:03.308 --> 19:07.187
CLEMENTINE, THE ENDANGERED
BLACK RHINO, IS PREGNANT.

19:07.271 --> 19:13.193
THE BABY, DUE IN 15 MONTHS,
WILL BE NAMED JELKA. AWW.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.779
AND, FINALLY, A CLEVELAND MAN
HAS COME FORWARD TO CLAIM

19:15.863 --> 19:19.575
THE $140 MILLION LOTTO JACKPOT.

19:19.658 --> 19:23.370
THE LUCKY WINNER IS--

19:23.453 --> 19:26.039
BUDDY NELNER? WHAT?

19:26.123 --> 19:29.001
A JANITOR FROM MAYFIELD HEIGHTS,
WHO APPARENTLY

19:29.084 --> 19:32.963
SWEPT THE WINNING TICKET
INTO HIS DUST PAN.

19:33.046 --> 19:34.173
WHAT A HEARTWARMING STORY.

19:34.256 --> 19:39.303
WELL, TO MR. BUDDY NELNER,
THIS REPORTER SAYS, "CONGRATS."

19:39.386 --> 19:42.723
AND...

19:42.806 --> 19:44.474
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.102
I COULD BE DATING A MILLIONAIRE
RIGHT NOW IF I'D JUST PICKED

19:47.185 --> 19:50.105
THE JANITOR AND NOT
SENATOR JUNK MAIL.

19:50.188 --> 19:53.483
- YOU'RE FORGETTING,
BUDDY'S IN A JAZZ BAND.

19:53.567 --> 19:57.321
- OH, YEAH.
THAT'S A LONG EVENING.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.406
HEY, IT'S REALLY CUTE THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO NAME

19:59.489 --> 20:01.783
THE BABY RHINO
AFTER YOU GUYS.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.411
- WE SAVED A SPECIES, JOY.
THANK YOU.

20:04.494 --> 20:07.789
- I WAS WONDERING,
DO RHINOS MATE FOR LIFE?

20:07.873 --> 20:11.460
- WELL, THESE WILL,
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYBODY ELSE.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.128
- STRANGELY,
THAT GIVES ME HOPE.

20:13.211 --> 20:16.298
AND BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
IT GIVES ME HOPE.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.799
- YOU'LL FIND SOMEBODY.
JUST BE PATIENT.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.135
- LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE.

20:20.218 --> 20:21.595
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

20:21.678 --> 20:24.973
- WELL, SURE.
IF A BLACK RHINO CAN FIND LOVE,

20:25.057 --> 20:28.644
SO CAN A WHITE WINO.
