WEBVTT

00:05.971 --> 00:08.031
When diplomacy fails,

00:08.108 --> 00:10.474
there's only one alternative--

00:10.543 --> 00:12.238
violence.

00:12.312 --> 00:16.180
Force must be applied
without apology.

00:19.786 --> 00:22.254
lt's the Starfleet way.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.882
Then our philosophies
are in agreement.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.653
Will you help us?

00:26.726 --> 00:30.025
You're asking me
to fight your war,

00:30.096 --> 00:32.792
destroy your enemy.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.731
l'm asking you
to intimidate the Kyrians

00:34.801 --> 00:36.268
with your technology...

00:36.336 --> 00:38.566
help me capture their leader.

00:38.638 --> 00:41.232
This ship
has superior firepower.

00:41.307 --> 00:43.468
He won't risk a conflict
with you.

00:43.543 --> 00:47.570
We risk life and limb

00:47.647 --> 00:52.050
so your people
can annex Kyrian land.

00:52.118 --> 00:54.643
Sounds like a good deal for you.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.313
What do we get?

00:56.389 --> 00:58.949
A way home.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.385
You know more about Voyager
than you've let on.

01:03.463 --> 01:06.455
Your reputation
in this Quadrant precedes you.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.398
That's why we sought you out.

01:08.468 --> 01:09.765
l'm listening.

01:09.836 --> 01:14.034
There's a cyclic wormhole
five days' journey from here.

01:14.107 --> 01:15.574
We know where it is

01:15.642 --> 01:18.236
and we can help you
stabilize it.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.443
lf you are lying...

01:24.517 --> 01:27.850
How far do you have to go?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.754
60, 000 light- years?

01:30.824 --> 01:35.784
l want all tactical data
regarding your little war:

01:35.862 --> 01:38.888
Kyrian defenses,
the position of your own forces,

01:38.965 --> 01:40.091
everything.

01:40.166 --> 01:43.033
You'll have it within the hour.

01:46.306 --> 01:48.831
Eight Kyrian fighter- ships
approaching.

01:48.908 --> 01:51.138
Arm the assault probes.

01:51.211 --> 01:52.473
Fire at will.

01:52.545 --> 01:53.807
Hail them.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.541
Channel open.

01:55.615 --> 01:59.881
This is Captain Janeway
of the Warship Voyager.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.080
Break off your attack,
or l'll destroy you.

02:02.155 --> 02:04.248
They are not responding.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.454
They're returning fire.

02:08.527 --> 02:09.824
Shields are holding.

02:09.895 --> 02:12.763
Chako- tay, any luck
tracking down their leader?

02:12.832 --> 02:14.197
Not yet.

02:14.267 --> 02:15.632
We think Tedran has
gone into hiding.

02:15.702 --> 02:16.669
l thought he might.

02:16.736 --> 02:18.727
We'll have to flush him out.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.602
What do you suggest?

02:20.673 --> 02:23.767
Biogenic weapons.

02:23.843 --> 02:25.333
We'll infect

02:25.411 --> 02:28.676
the most populated
Kyrian territories.

02:28.748 --> 02:31.876
The Doctor's nearly done
working on the weapon.

02:31.951 --> 02:36.183
Our conflict is with Tedran
himself, not with his people.

02:36.256 --> 02:37.280
They're innocent.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.688
The best way
to bring down a ruler

02:38.758 --> 02:40.055
is to make his people suffer.

02:40.126 --> 02:41.388
- Captain...
- This is no time

02:41.461 --> 02:42.393
for half- measures.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.794
You wanted victory.

02:44.864 --> 02:45.990
You're going to get it.

02:46.065 --> 02:48.033
Bridge to Sick Bay.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.363
Status?

02:49.435 --> 02:51.528
We have established
a datalink

02:51.604 --> 02:53.936
between my neural net
and the phaser array.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.474
l am reconfiguring the beam

02:55.542 --> 02:58.909
to carry a bio- agent
into the planet's atmosphere.

02:58.978 --> 03:01.276
When will it be ready?

03:01.347 --> 03:03.941
lt is ready now, Captain.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.383
Phasers are on line.

03:06.452 --> 03:08.420
Target the first city.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.521
And fire.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:22.135 --> 03:23.602
The Warship Voyager--

03:23.670 --> 03:26.798
one of the most powerful vessels
of its time.

03:26.873 --> 03:30.604
Armed with photonic torpedoes
and particle weapons,

03:30.677 --> 03:31.974
this ship of destruction

03:32.045 --> 03:35.037
could wipe out an entire
civilization within hours.

03:35.114 --> 03:37.708
On this particular day
in history, we were lucky.

03:37.784 --> 03:39.877
The death toll
could've been much worse.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.387
By the time Voyager
targeted our major cities,

03:42.455 --> 03:45.185
Tedran had already begun
an evacuation.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.021
Thousands of lives were saved.

03:47.093 --> 03:48.424
Unfortunately, it was
only the beginning

03:48.494 --> 03:51.190
of Captain Janeway's onslaught.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.390
As you'll see,

03:52.465 --> 03:56.401
her actions would have a
lasting effect on our world.

03:56.469 --> 03:59.097
Even today, 700 years later,

03:59.172 --> 04:04.769
we are still feeling the impact
of the Voyager encounter.

05:54.787 --> 05:57.051
Before we continue
the simulation,

05:57.123 --> 05:59.887
l'd like to answer
any questions you might have.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.519
l'm curious
about Voyager itself.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.220
How many people were on board?

06:04.263 --> 06:05.855
We believe
they had a complement

06:05.932 --> 06:08.366
of over 300 soldiers.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.459
Did they attack
other worlds, as well?

06:10.536 --> 06:12.731
Well, we aren't certain.

06:12.805 --> 06:15.069
Records of Voyager's travels
through our Quadrant

06:15.141 --> 06:17.234
are incomplete,
but it's safe to assume

06:17.310 --> 06:20.507
that they interfered
with many other cultures, yes.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.172
Tell us more
about the Borg drones

06:22.248 --> 06:23.408
they kept on the ship.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.974
Voyager had many weapons
at their disposal,

06:26.052 --> 06:29.021
including species they'd
assimilated along the way:

06:29.088 --> 06:31.955
Borg, Talaxian, Kazon.

06:32.024 --> 06:33.321
They were captured
and made to work

06:33.393 --> 06:34.724
as part of Voyager's
fighting force.

06:34.794 --> 06:36.523
Let's resume the simulation,

06:36.596 --> 06:38.530
and you can see for yourself.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.401
lt's a few hours after
the initial bombardment.

06:43.469 --> 06:45.096
Janeway and her squadron
are on the Bridge,

06:45.171 --> 06:46.638
mounting their assault.

06:46.706 --> 06:51.803
Now, what you are about to see
is graphic and unsettling.

06:53.045 --> 06:54.672
Status.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.647
Status!

06:56.716 --> 06:58.445
Approximately
3, 000 Kyrians dead.

06:58.518 --> 06:59.450
That's it?

06:59.519 --> 07:01.384
The bio- agent
is still dispersing

07:01.454 --> 07:02.614
through the atmosphere.

07:02.688 --> 07:06.180
The fatality rate
will be 300, 000 soon enough.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.385
How soon?

07:07.460 --> 07:08.722
Best guess--

07:08.795 --> 07:10.057
one hour.

07:10.129 --> 07:12.962
Why do you always
keep me waiting, Tuvok?

07:14.467 --> 07:16.128
My apologies.

07:16.202 --> 07:18.397
Preparing to fire again.

07:18.471 --> 07:21.065
Double the yield.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.938
Captain, don't you think
that's excessive?

07:24.010 --> 07:25.375
You picked a bad time

07:25.445 --> 07:27.811
to have second thoughts,
Ambassador.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.075
l want them defeated,

07:30.149 --> 07:33.277
but...but this is genocide.

07:33.352 --> 07:34.944
Defeat? Genocide?

07:35.021 --> 07:37.114
Why quibble with semantics?

07:37.190 --> 07:39.852
This wasn't our agreement.

07:42.328 --> 07:44.455
We're going to defeat
the Kyrians

07:44.530 --> 07:47.988
and you're going to keep up
your end of the bargain.

07:52.772 --> 07:57.072
Ensign, confine
this gentleman to the brig.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.735
l'll let you know
when it's over.

08:03.549 --> 08:06.916
Three more Kyrian vessels
approaching.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.248
Evade them.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.618
Aye, aye, sir.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.026
The location?

08:22.034 --> 08:24.628
Look...l can keep
this up all day.

08:24.704 --> 08:27.798
Tell the Commander
what he wants to know.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.111
Maybe l can't keep
this up all day.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.583
l'm a man of peace.

08:40.653 --> 08:43.645
My native people
are enlightened...

08:43.722 --> 08:45.054
nonviolent...

08:45.124 --> 08:46.591
much like your own.

08:46.659 --> 08:50.026
l'm saddened that this
has happened to you.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.726
lf we can work together,

08:53.799 --> 08:56.700
maybe we can end
this conflict.

08:56.769 --> 08:58.134
Stand aside, Chako- tay.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.466
Let me hit him.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.441
That hyperspanner would cause
an unacceptable level of damage.

09:03.543 --> 09:07.001
l remind you--
he must still be able to speak.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.848
What do you have in mind?

09:11.918 --> 09:13.385
This neural solvent--

09:13.452 --> 09:16.114
a clean and efficient
inducer of pain--

09:16.188 --> 09:17.450
far more effective

09:17.523 --> 09:20.321
than your crude
attempts at persuasion.

09:22.929 --> 09:26.660
No doubt you are experiencing
a tingling sensation

09:26.732 --> 09:27.994
behind your eyes.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.934
The chemical is dissolving
your optic nerves.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.971
l'll ask you again.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.597
Where is Tedran?

09:34.674 --> 09:38.804
The pain will increase
exponentially

09:38.878 --> 09:41.403
until your cerebral
cortex begins to liquefy.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.380
l can reverse the process...

09:43.449 --> 09:45.280
if ordered to do so.

09:45.351 --> 09:47.615
And l want to give that order.

09:47.687 --> 09:50.212
But you have to tell me...

09:50.289 --> 09:53.918
where is Tedran?

09:53.993 --> 09:57.019
He's here, at these coordinates.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.724
Assuming our prisoner
told you the truth.

09:59.799 --> 10:02.734
Oh, believe me, he was
very cooperative at the end.

10:02.802 --> 10:03.928
Neelix?

10:04.003 --> 10:05.595
l'm reading
a fortified compound

10:05.671 --> 10:08.139
1. 6 kilometers
beneath the surface.

10:08.207 --> 10:11.108
Chako- tay, you and Tuvok
take an assault team

10:11.177 --> 10:13.611
and find Tedran.

10:13.679 --> 10:16.341
Make sure he's escorted
safely to Voyager.

10:16.415 --> 10:17.439
Yes, sir.

10:18.651 --> 10:20.016
What now?

10:20.086 --> 10:23.351
lntruders. Four Kyrians just
beamed into the Engine Room.

10:23.422 --> 10:24.889
Bridge to Engineering.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.481
Respond.

10:26.559 --> 10:29.357
They've erected force fields.

10:29.428 --> 10:31.396
Our soldiers can't get in.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.264
They've left me no choice.

10:35.334 --> 10:36.596
Computer...

10:36.669 --> 10:39.866
initiate the Borg
activation sequence.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.907
Sequence in progress.

10:41.974 --> 10:45.205
Bridge to Seven of Nine.

10:45.277 --> 10:46.710
State your instructions.

10:46.779 --> 10:50.215
A group of Kyrians
is in the Engine Room.

10:50.282 --> 10:51.715
Stop them.

10:51.784 --> 10:53.979
We understand.

11:22.448 --> 11:25.212
Resistance is futile.

11:25.284 --> 11:27.343
Seven of Nine to the Bridge.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.287
The Kyrian threat
has been neutralized.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.584
Acknowledged.

11:31.657 --> 11:33.989
Two of the Kyrians
are still alive.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.891
What shall we do with them?

11:35.961 --> 11:39.795
Well, you've been wanting
to expand your fighting force.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.127
Assimilate them.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.397
We understand.

11:44.470 --> 11:47.906
l just received word
from the attack team.

11:47.973 --> 11:49.463
Good news, Lieutenant?

11:49.542 --> 11:50.702
Very.

11:50.776 --> 11:53.574
They've captured Tedran
and one of his aides.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.671
They're heading back
to Voyager.

11:57.349 --> 11:59.112
Take them to Chamber 19

11:59.185 --> 12:01.312
and get the Vaskan Ambassador.

12:01.387 --> 12:04.914
This is one negotiation
he won't want to miss.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.066
Welcome aboard.

12:17.136 --> 12:19.730
l appreciate your hospitality.

12:19.805 --> 12:23.036
Are all your guests
treated so well?

12:23.109 --> 12:24.371
Well, it's not every day

12:24.443 --> 12:26.877
that we receive
such an important visitor--

12:26.946 --> 12:28.174
the great Tedran...

12:28.247 --> 12:31.546
a man of wisdom and peace...

12:31.617 --> 12:33.209
a servant of his people.

12:33.285 --> 12:36.652
Well, your people need you,
now more than ever.

12:36.722 --> 12:39.418
State your demands.

12:39.492 --> 12:44.520
Tell your forces to stand down,
and l'll call off my attack.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.998
l understand
what the Vaskans want--

12:48.067 --> 12:50.661
more of our territory...

12:50.736 --> 12:52.101
more resources.

12:52.171 --> 12:54.901
But what do you want, Captain?

12:54.974 --> 12:57.670
Why are you doing this to us?

12:57.743 --> 13:00.268
He's offered my crew a way home.

13:00.346 --> 13:03.907
To reach your home,
you would destroy ours?

13:04.083 --> 13:05.243
That's right.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.979
And you'd do the same
in my position.

13:08.053 --> 13:10.954
No, l would not.

13:11.023 --> 13:15.016
Spoken like a true martyr.

13:15.094 --> 13:17.494
You're very enlightened.

13:20.065 --> 13:23.523
But are you so proud...

13:23.602 --> 13:29.040
that you'd let your people die
before you'd humble yourself?

13:33.412 --> 13:35.209
Tell them to surrender.

13:37.082 --> 13:39.050
You have shamed us all.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.484
We could've ended this
on our own...

13:41.554 --> 13:42.885
peacefully...

13:42.988 --> 13:44.683
without her.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.520
Surrender.

13:49.028 --> 13:50.359
No.

14:05.344 --> 14:09.212
We will prevail.

14:18.224 --> 14:21.216
Don't look so shocked,
Ambassador.

14:21.293 --> 14:24.057
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

14:34.340 --> 14:37.309
The ensuing conflict
was brief but brutal--

14:37.376 --> 14:40.504
two million Kyrians
slaughtered within days.

14:42.514 --> 14:45.005
The Warship Voyager
continued on its way,

14:45.084 --> 14:47.279
leaving the Kyrian dynasty
in ruins.

14:47.353 --> 14:50.288
The Vaskan leaders proceeded
to occupy our lands,

14:50.356 --> 14:52.551
forcing my people
into subservience.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.287
lt took centuries for us
to undo the damage

14:55.361 --> 14:57.192
that Captain Janeway had done.

14:57.263 --> 15:00.562
And the Kyrian struggle
for equality is far from over.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.533
This simulation and this museum

15:02.601 --> 15:04.933
are a testament
to that struggle.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.529
l hope you found
your experience here worthwhile.

15:07.606 --> 15:09.665
lf you'd like to learn
more about Voyager

15:09.742 --> 15:12.006
and its role
in the history of our planet,

15:12.077 --> 15:14.443
l suggest you explore
the rest of this exhibit.

15:14.513 --> 15:15.639
Thank you for your time.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.428
Please, feel free
to try the simulation.

15:40.506 --> 15:42.235
Oh, thank you very much.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.369
l wouldn't touch
that if l were you.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.678
One of the Voyager's torpedoes--
25- isoton yield.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.480
lt could destroy an entire city
within seconds.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.384
lt's been inactive
for centuries,

15:56.455 --> 15:57.752
but you never know.

15:57.823 --> 16:00.553
No, l'm only teasing,
but, please, be careful.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.457
lf we damage
any of these relics,

16:02.528 --> 16:04.052
they can never be replaced.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.757
The history of our people
should be respected.

16:06.865 --> 16:09.060
l have a question
about that history.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.101
Please.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.433
How can you prove
that it's true?

16:12.504 --> 16:14.904
Take a closer look.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.566
The evidence is all around you.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.974
Some musty fossils
and a re- creation?

16:19.044 --> 16:20.511
That doesn't prove anything.

16:20.579 --> 16:23.139
l disagree.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.648
You're trying
to blame the Vaskans

16:24.717 --> 16:26.685
for all your troubles,
the way you always do.

16:26.752 --> 16:29.380
l don't have a problem
with your species.

16:29.455 --> 16:32.788
l have Kyrian friends,
but l don't appreciate

16:32.858 --> 16:35.053
seeing my people
being portrayed as villains

16:35.127 --> 16:38.119
in your little simulation,
and l certainly don't want

16:38.197 --> 16:40.062
your history taught
to my children.

16:40.132 --> 16:42.760
Well, you'd better
get used to the idea,

16:42.835 --> 16:44.928
because we've just uncovered
an artifact that's going

16:45.004 --> 16:46.972
to confirm everything
you've seen here.

16:47.039 --> 16:48.199
Three weeks ago,

16:48.273 --> 16:50.741
our research team
found a data- storage device

16:50.809 --> 16:53.300
buried nine meters
beneath the ruins at Kesef.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.643
l've confirmed
that it came from Voyager.

16:55.714 --> 16:57.477
Another fossil?

16:57.549 --> 16:59.574
The device contains
active data...

16:59.651 --> 17:00.811
possibly crew logs--

17:00.919 --> 17:03.410
even Captain Janeway's
personal almanac.

17:03.489 --> 17:04.854
ln the next few days,
we could be hearing

17:04.923 --> 17:06.151
Voyager's version
of these events,

17:06.224 --> 17:07.487
in their own words!

17:07.559 --> 17:09.424
And what if those words
tell a different story?

17:09.494 --> 17:10.757
What then?

17:12.231 --> 17:14.756
We will change our views
accordingly.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.960
l'm sure you will.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.732
l apologize.

17:22.808 --> 17:25.402
Please, enjoy
the rest of your visit.

17:45.664 --> 17:49.122
Activate re- creation:
"The Voyager Encounter."

17:49.201 --> 17:50.793
Display Engine Room.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.348
Begin dictation.

18:09.922 --> 18:13.323
l'm resuming work
on artifact 27 1:

18:13.392 --> 18:15.724
the Voyager data- storage device.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.031
l've decided to try
using period tools

18:20.099 --> 18:22.431
from the simulation itself.

18:22.501 --> 18:26.096
With any luck,
they'll be more compatible.

18:35.647 --> 18:36.909
Hmm...

18:36.982 --> 18:39.883
there's far more data here
than l expected.

18:43.622 --> 18:46.489
Seems more like a program
of some sort.

18:48.494 --> 18:49.461
Yes.

18:49.528 --> 18:50.620
Yes!

18:50.696 --> 18:53.790
lt's an optronic datastream...

18:53.866 --> 18:55.265
a hologram.

19:07.079 --> 19:10.139
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

19:12.751 --> 19:15.686
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.920
l recognize you.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.288
You're Voyager's Doctor.

19:20.359 --> 19:21.883
What am l doing in Engineering?

19:23.495 --> 19:25.360
Where's my mobile emitter?

19:25.430 --> 19:26.727
You're not an android.

19:26.798 --> 19:27.730
Of course not.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.494
What are you talking about?

19:29.568 --> 19:30.762
A Kyrian.

19:30.869 --> 19:33.167
Doctor to the Bridge.
lntruder alert!

19:33.238 --> 19:34.728
Security to Engineering!

19:34.806 --> 19:36.706
You won't have
much luck with that.

19:36.775 --> 19:38.072
Nothing in here is real.

19:38.143 --> 19:39.337
lt's a simulation.

19:40.812 --> 19:41.779
A holodeck?

19:41.847 --> 19:42.905
No.

19:42.981 --> 19:45.074
You're in the Museum
of Kyrian Heritage.

19:45.150 --> 19:47.744
You've stolen my program.

19:47.819 --> 19:48.751
How?

19:48.820 --> 19:49.752
Please...

19:49.821 --> 19:51.345
let me try to explain.

19:51.423 --> 19:52.913
Try quickly.

19:52.991 --> 19:54.754
You...

19:54.826 --> 19:56.760
are a hologram.

19:56.828 --> 19:58.352
That l know.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.591
Uh...l just discovered
your program

20:00.666 --> 20:02.657
inside this data- storage device.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.361
That's the EMH backup module.

20:04.436 --> 20:07.337
One of your attack parties must
have taken it from Sick Bay.

20:07.506 --> 20:09.667
Actually, we found it
at the ruins at Kesef.

20:11.343 --> 20:14.369
l know this will be difficult
for you to accept,

20:14.446 --> 20:16.710
but a great deal
of time has passed

20:16.782 --> 20:19.148
since Voyager
encountered the Kyrians.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.482
How much time?

20:21.553 --> 20:24.852
700 years,
give or take a decade.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.151
We're not certain.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.590
l don't believe you.

20:27.659 --> 20:28.683
Think about it.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.489
When your program is inactive,

20:30.562 --> 20:33.395
a moment or a millennium
are the same to you.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.734
700 years?

20:42.107 --> 20:43.802
What about my ship?

20:43.875 --> 20:46.036
What happened to my crew?

20:46.111 --> 20:47.078
No one knows.

20:47.145 --> 20:49.613
lt's safe to say
they're long dead.

20:51.617 --> 20:54.848
And l'm some sort of...
fossil?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.387
No, not a fossil--

20:56.455 --> 21:01.154
a witness, a living witness
to history.

21:01.226 --> 21:03.751
There's so much we don't know
about what happened,

21:03.829 --> 21:05.194
but you saw it.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.926
You lived through those times.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.662
You helped to shape them.

21:10.736 --> 21:13.068
Doctor, you could be
the most important discovery

21:13.138 --> 21:14.105
of all time.

21:14.172 --> 21:15.469
No, this isn't possible.

21:15.540 --> 21:16.507
Doctor...

21:16.575 --> 21:17.837
l don't believe you.

21:17.909 --> 21:18.841
Doctor!

21:44.369 --> 21:46.894
What's going to happen
to me now?

21:47.005 --> 21:49.030
Will you put me on display?

21:49.107 --> 21:51.541
The holographic Rip van Winkle?

21:51.610 --> 21:52.872
l'm not sure.

21:52.944 --> 21:55.139
l want to try
to contact Starfleet...

21:55.213 --> 21:56.942
if there still is a Starfleet.

21:57.015 --> 21:58.448
That will have to wait.

21:58.517 --> 21:59.779
Wait for what?

21:59.851 --> 22:02.115
There are other...
issues to be resolved.

22:02.220 --> 22:03.482
What kind of issues?

22:03.522 --> 22:04.989
You're the Voyager Doctor.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.423
A lot of people are going
to have questions.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.652
On our world,

22:08.727 --> 22:11.423
artificial life- forms
are considered sentient

22:11.496 --> 22:13.521
and responsible
for their actions.

22:13.598 --> 22:15.463
You might have to face charges.

22:15.534 --> 22:16.626
Charges?

22:16.702 --> 22:17.691
For your crimes.

22:17.769 --> 22:19.134
You designed the bio- weapons

22:19.204 --> 22:21.001
that killed
eight million Kyrians.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.166
l did nothing of the sort.

22:23.241 --> 22:25.732
All of our evidence shows
that you were a war criminal.

22:25.811 --> 22:27.142
Evidence? What evidence?

22:27.212 --> 22:29.373
Like this, for example?
Triple- armored hull?

22:29.448 --> 22:31.177
30 torpedo tubes?
25 phaser banks?

22:31.249 --> 22:33.183
This isn't what our ship
looked like.

22:33.251 --> 22:35.617
We reconstructed it
from a partial schematic

22:35.687 --> 22:37.245
found in the Cyrik Ocean...

22:37.322 --> 22:38.846
which was badly damaged
by corrosion.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.755
We were bound to get
a few details wrong.

22:40.826 --> 22:42.817
Voyager wasn't a warship.

22:42.894 --> 22:44.259
We were explorers!

22:44.329 --> 22:46.820
Yes, l know--
trying to get home, to Mars.

22:46.898 --> 22:49.799
Earth! You see, you couldn't
even get that right!

22:49.868 --> 22:51.301
This is a nightmare.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.099
What if l'm found guilty?

22:53.171 --> 22:55.196
What's going to happen to me?

22:55.273 --> 22:57.207
That's up to the Arbiters.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.140
But l imagine
the penalty would be severe.

22:59.211 --> 23:02.146
Your program
could be decompiled.

23:02.247 --> 23:04.340
You've got to believe me.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.817
To you, this may be
ancient history.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.750
To me, it's yesterday.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.811
You called me a living witness.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.151
Well, at least
give me the chance

23:12.224 --> 23:13.589
to set the record straight.

23:13.658 --> 23:16.752
l want to see your version
of what happened.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.830
We've already drained
two phaser banks,

23:18.930 --> 23:19.988
and he hasn't hit anything.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.499
lf you looked at your
console once in awhile,

23:22.567 --> 23:24.467
instead of chasing
the female ensigns,

23:24.536 --> 23:25.730
you'd see otherwise.

23:25.804 --> 23:26.771
Tom's right.

23:26.838 --> 23:27.805
This war was supposed

23:27.873 --> 23:28.999
to be over in five minutes.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.008
You have a better idea,
Lieutenant?

23:31.076 --> 23:32.475
As a matter of fact, l do.

23:32.544 --> 23:35.012
Fighter shuttles--
a direct assault.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.344
Led by you? Good luck.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.213
Watch your mouth, hedgehog.

23:39.284 --> 23:40.876
l haven't heard
a single good idea.

23:40.986 --> 23:43.887
Well, then propose something,
First Officer.

23:43.955 --> 23:45.547
Earn your rank for once.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.656
Get away from us...

23:51.396 --> 23:53.193
Gentlemen...

23:53.265 --> 23:55.199
Gentlemen!

23:58.570 --> 24:04.475
Save it for the holodeck--
we've got a war to fight.

24:04.543 --> 24:06.602
We've only been attacking

24:06.678 --> 24:10.478
the Kyrian military
installations-- a mistake.

24:10.549 --> 24:13.313
We should target
the general population.

24:13.385 --> 24:15.319
Excellent idea, Captain.

24:15.387 --> 24:16.547
l've examined
the Kyrian genome,

24:16.621 --> 24:17.610
and they would be vulnerable

24:17.689 --> 24:19.020
to any number
of biological weapons.

24:19.090 --> 24:21.490
How soon could you
have one ready?

24:21.560 --> 24:23.653
Within the hour.

24:25.664 --> 24:28.292
Dismissed.

24:28.366 --> 24:29.833
Pure fiction.

24:29.901 --> 24:31.664
This is absurd.

24:31.736 --> 24:33.328
Halt re- creation.

24:33.405 --> 24:35.805
This is
a reasonable extrapolation

24:35.874 --> 24:37.068
from historic record.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.575
But if you'd like

24:38.643 --> 24:40.508
to point out
any inconsistencies...

24:40.579 --> 24:41.637
lnconsistencies?

24:41.713 --> 24:43.271
l don't know where to begin.

24:43.348 --> 24:45.782
Granted, this looks
like the briefing room,

24:45.851 --> 24:47.842
but these aren't
the people l knew.

24:47.919 --> 24:50.183
No one behaved like this.

24:50.255 --> 24:52.883
Well...aside from Mr. Paris.

24:52.958 --> 24:55.222
We weren't
at each other's throats.

24:55.293 --> 24:56.885
We didn't talk about
how to destroy planets.

24:56.995 --> 24:57.893
We helped people.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.055
We were an enlightened crew.

25:00.131 --> 25:02.258
Are you denying
these events took place?

25:02.334 --> 25:03.426
Yes.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.764
Are you saying
you never got involved

25:04.836 --> 25:05.996
in the conflict
between my people

25:06.071 --> 25:08.039
- and the Vaskans?
- Yes!

25:08.106 --> 25:09.596
Well, no, we did get involved,

25:09.674 --> 25:11.266
but it was nothing like this.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.310
Elaborate.

25:14.079 --> 25:16.809
There was a meeting
in this room,

25:16.882 --> 25:19.248
but it wasn't
about battle tactics,

25:19.317 --> 25:21.979
it was about a dilemma
we were facing.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.824
We had negotiated a trade
agreement with the Vaskans.

25:26.892 --> 25:30.020
We were dealing with
a representative, Ambassador...

25:30.095 --> 25:31.357
Ambassador Daleth.

25:31.429 --> 25:33.056
Daleth. Exactly.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.663
Everything was going
according to plan...

25:38.737 --> 25:40.796
until...

25:42.641 --> 25:44.302
..we were attacked...

25:44.376 --> 25:46.936
by your people, the Kyrians.

25:47.012 --> 25:49.310
They'd picked that moment
to start a war

25:49.381 --> 25:51.110
and we were caught
in the middle.

25:51.182 --> 25:52.672
The Kyrians were the aggressors?

25:52.751 --> 25:54.651
No, no, that can't be right.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.311
Captain Janeway called
this meeting to figure out

25:56.388 --> 25:58.049
how we could extricate ourselves
from the conflict

25:58.123 --> 26:00.455
and still maintain the trade
agreement with the Vaskans.

26:00.525 --> 26:02.220
But we weren't on their side,

26:02.294 --> 26:04.353
and we certainly
never attacked you.

26:04.429 --> 26:08.490
Save your objections until
you see the entire re- creation.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.864
Let's continue.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.068
We will prevail.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.113
Don't look so shocked,
Ambassador.

26:25.183 --> 26:27.481
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

26:35.927 --> 26:40.796
Somewhere-- halfway
across the galaxy, l hope--

26:40.865 --> 26:44.028
Captain Janeway
is spinning in her grave.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.831
You've portrayed us as monsters.

26:45.904 --> 26:47.838
The Captain's
a cold- blooded killer;

26:47.939 --> 26:50.931
the crew's a gang of thugs;
and l'm a mass murderer.

26:51.009 --> 26:52.840
- Calm yourself.
- Why should l?

26:52.911 --> 26:55.243
l'm about to be hanged
for crimes l didn't commit.

26:55.313 --> 26:57.679
Tell me your version of events.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.445
l remember this man.

27:04.522 --> 27:05.614
Tedran.

27:05.690 --> 27:07.317
He was a martyr to our people.

27:07.392 --> 27:08.518
Some martyr.

27:08.593 --> 27:11.153
He led the Kyrian attack
against Voyager.

27:11.229 --> 27:12.253
You're lying.

27:12.330 --> 27:13.354
l was there.

27:13.431 --> 27:15.422
You're trying
to protect yourself.

27:15.500 --> 27:16.762
And so are you!

27:16.835 --> 27:18.063
From the truth.

27:18.236 --> 27:19.965
lsn't it a coincidence
that the Kyrians are

27:20.038 --> 27:22.131
being portrayed
in the best possible light?

27:22.207 --> 27:26.234
Martyrs, heroes, saviors.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.778
Obviously, events
have been reinterpreted

27:27.879 --> 27:30.347
to make your people
feel better about themselves.

27:30.415 --> 27:32.576
Revisionist history...

27:32.651 --> 27:34.050
it's such a comfort.

27:34.119 --> 27:36.110
We were not the aggressors
in the Great War.

27:36.187 --> 27:37.586
We were the victims.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.124
The proof can be found
anywhere on this world.

27:40.191 --> 27:42.921
The Kyrian people are
being oppressed to this day.

27:42.994 --> 27:45.258
The problems in your society
are none of my business.

27:45.330 --> 27:48.697
l'm just telling you
what l saw 700 years ago.

27:48.767 --> 27:51.827
l don't believe you,
and neither will anyone else.

27:51.903 --> 27:52.927
What are you doing?

27:53.004 --> 27:54.437
Shutting down your program.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.768
Wait. Please. l...

27:55.840 --> 27:57.137
l can prove to you l'm right.

27:57.208 --> 27:58.266
The medical tricorder--

27:58.343 --> 27:59.833
the artifact
you have on display.

27:59.944 --> 28:00.933
lf you just let me...

28:06.484 --> 28:07.849
Lies.

28:19.197 --> 28:22.098
Begin dictation.

28:22.167 --> 28:24.362
l've reexamined the data module

28:24.436 --> 28:27.963
and from what l can tell, the
Doctor was telling the truth--

28:28.039 --> 28:30.940
at least about one thing.

28:31.009 --> 28:36.140
He is a hologram,
a backup program.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.648
We always knew he was
an artificial life- form,

28:38.717 --> 28:41.117
but we thought
he was an android.

28:44.155 --> 28:47.716
lf we were mistaken
about that...

28:47.792 --> 28:50.818
l wonder if we might also
be wrong about Voyager itself.

28:54.165 --> 28:56.497
Another question:

28:56.568 --> 28:59.469
Why would a hologram
designed for medical purposes

28:59.537 --> 29:02.802
be programmed to lie so readily?

29:02.907 --> 29:04.169
From the moment l activated him,

29:04.209 --> 29:07.406
this Doctor has insisted
that he's innocent.

29:07.479 --> 29:10.846
At first, l...
didn't believe him.

29:14.519 --> 29:16.510
End dictation.

29:38.576 --> 29:42.706
Activate re- creation:
"The Voyager Encounter."

29:42.781 --> 29:44.908
Display Medical Chamber.

29:56.427 --> 29:59.055
Please state the nature
of the medical...

29:59.130 --> 30:01.963
Oh. lt's you.

30:03.601 --> 30:06.161
You've given me a lot
to think about.

30:06.237 --> 30:07.329
Really?

30:07.405 --> 30:10.966
l thought you'd heard enough
of my...lies.

30:11.042 --> 30:12.566
l judged you too quickly.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.611
l'm sorry.

30:13.678 --> 30:15.373
What changed your mind?

30:15.446 --> 30:18.279
Time to think.

30:18.349 --> 30:20.681
For your information,
l don't appreciate

30:20.752 --> 30:23.516
being deactivated
in the middle of a sentence.

30:23.588 --> 30:25.351
lt brings back...

30:25.423 --> 30:26.856
unpleasant memories.

30:26.925 --> 30:28.051
lt won't happen again.

30:28.126 --> 30:29.286
Good.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.418
Because if you don't stop
treating me

30:30.495 --> 30:31.427
like a second- class hologram,

30:31.496 --> 30:33.760
l won't cooperate
with your investigation.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.561
l'm perfectly happy
to lie dormant

30:35.633 --> 30:37.225
in that data module
for a few eons.

30:37.302 --> 30:38.701
l didn't come here to argue.

30:38.770 --> 30:40.237
Then what do you want?

30:41.539 --> 30:43.507
l don't know.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.339
To talk, l guess,

30:46.411 --> 30:50.108
about what really happened
700 years ago.

30:50.181 --> 30:51.546
Are you sure
you're willing to listen

30:51.616 --> 30:54.608
to a mass- murderer like me?

30:54.686 --> 30:56.813
l'm willing to keep
an open mind.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.685
That's the most l can promise.

31:00.158 --> 31:02.490
Try to understand
my point of view.

31:02.560 --> 31:05.222
All my life, l thought
l knew the truth.

31:05.296 --> 31:07.059
There was never any doubt.

31:07.131 --> 31:09.827
l never meant to throw
your beliefs into doubt,

31:09.901 --> 31:12.233
but l can't deny
what l know to be true.

31:12.303 --> 31:14.237
l realize that now...

31:14.305 --> 31:17.069
and l want to know the truth.

31:17.141 --> 31:20.338
And l want the Arbiters
to know it, too.

31:20.411 --> 31:22.845
Well...

31:22.914 --> 31:26.782
the stage is certainly set,

31:26.851 --> 31:29.115
but l'll have to rewrite
the characters

31:29.187 --> 31:30.882
and revise the plot a little.

31:30.955 --> 31:33.446
l'm quite adept in the art
of holographic programming.

31:33.524 --> 31:35.549
lf you'll give me access
to your technology,

31:35.627 --> 31:38.528
maybe l can create
a simulation of my own...

31:38.596 --> 31:40.461
show you what happened.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.035
Don't worry, Ambassador.

31:45.103 --> 31:46.900
We've got plenty
of medical supplies,

31:46.971 --> 31:49.462
and we'd be more than happy
to share them with you.

31:49.540 --> 31:50.666
Then we agree.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.369
ln exchange, we'll provide you

31:52.443 --> 31:54.411
with as much dilithium
as you need.

31:54.479 --> 31:56.344
That's very generous,
Ambassador.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.848
l'll transport the canisters
immediately.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.646
lt would be
in your best interest

32:00.752 --> 32:02.344
to make this exchange quickly.

32:02.387 --> 32:03.319
Oh? Why is that?

32:03.388 --> 32:04.480
We've been in conflict

32:04.555 --> 32:06.750
with a neighboring species,
the Kyrians.

32:06.824 --> 32:09.122
They've been threatening
to attack us.

32:09.193 --> 32:11.661
War could break out any day.

32:11.729 --> 32:13.822
We've tried
every diplomatic option,

32:13.898 --> 32:16.628
but the Kyrians are
a violent, stubborn people.

32:16.701 --> 32:21.138
No problem. l understand
what you're going through.

32:21.205 --> 32:23.400
l wish l could make you
one of our diplomats.

32:23.474 --> 32:26.307
You might have better luck
resolving this situation.

32:26.377 --> 32:28.106
Under different circumstances...

32:28.179 --> 32:29.578
Janeway to Sick Bay.

32:29.647 --> 32:30.875
This is the Doctor.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.680
Ambassador Daleth and l
have reached an agreement.

32:34.752 --> 32:36.014
Assemble the medical supplies.

32:36.087 --> 32:37.145
Done, Captain.

32:37.221 --> 32:39.052
The supplies are in Cargo Bay 1.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.455
Once we transport the supplies
to the surface, there may be...

32:43.061 --> 32:44.028
Red Alert.

32:44.095 --> 32:45.255
Captain Janeway to the Bridge.

32:48.533 --> 32:51.161
We're being fired on
by three ships.

32:51.235 --> 32:52.167
The Kyrians.

32:52.236 --> 32:53.168
Hail them.

32:53.237 --> 32:54.397
Channel open.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.099
This is Captain Janeway
of the Starship Voyager.

32:56.174 --> 32:57.141
We are not your enemies.

32:57.208 --> 33:00.075
Please break off your attack.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.374
They're not responding.

33:02.447 --> 33:05.814
l'd advise you
to retreat, Captain.

33:05.917 --> 33:07.714
Shields down to 86 percent.

33:07.785 --> 33:08.717
Break out of orbit.

33:08.786 --> 33:10.048
Put some distance between us.

33:10.121 --> 33:11.884
Yes, ma'am.

33:12.957 --> 33:13.924
Four intruders.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.323
They are in Engineering.

33:15.393 --> 33:17.293
Janeway to Engineering.

33:17.362 --> 33:18.556
B'Elanna, respond.

33:19.897 --> 33:21.364
Tuvok.

33:25.236 --> 33:28.034
Take as much of their technology
as you can.

33:28.106 --> 33:29.403
You will fail.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.108
Drop your weapons.

33:34.178 --> 33:35.702
Back away.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.286
- Tuvok to Janeway.
- Go ahead.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.521
The Kyrians have killed three
of the Engineering crew.

33:51.596 --> 33:52.893
They've taken Seven of Nine

33:52.964 --> 33:55.125
and one of the injured
crew members hostage.

33:55.199 --> 33:57.394
They're now on Deck 2,
Section 32.

33:57.468 --> 33:58.730
Acknowledged.

33:58.803 --> 34:00.964
Remember your offer
to make me a diplomat?

34:01.072 --> 34:03.302
Well, it looks like l don't
have much of a choice.

34:03.341 --> 34:04.808
Tell the Doctor
we have casualties.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.343
Have him meet us on Deck 2.

34:11.282 --> 34:12.248
Janeway to Tuvok.

34:12.315 --> 34:13.976
We're approaching Section 31.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.384
The evacuation of Deck 2
is complete.

34:16.454 --> 34:18.684
Send three security
teams to this deck,

34:18.755 --> 34:20.587
then seal all the access points.

34:20.658 --> 34:21.818
Acknowledged.

34:21.926 --> 34:23.223
How typical of the Kyrians.

34:23.293 --> 34:24.226
What do you mean?

34:24.295 --> 34:27.321
They fight the same way
they live-- deviously.

34:32.503 --> 34:33.594
Janeway to Tuvok.

34:33.670 --> 34:34.695
Tuvok here.

34:34.772 --> 34:35.830
The Kyrians are
in the Mess Hall.

34:35.907 --> 34:36.873
We're going in.

34:36.940 --> 34:37.929
Security is on the way.

34:38.009 --> 34:39.873
l'll go first, Captain,
and draw any fire, if need be.

34:39.976 --> 34:41.069
Your crew is heroic, Captain.

34:41.145 --> 34:42.976
l just happen to be
invulnerable to phaser fire,

34:43.047 --> 34:44.241
but l appreciate the compliment.

34:44.315 --> 34:45.577
- Captain?
- Go.

34:48.553 --> 34:50.315
Tedran...

34:50.388 --> 34:51.446
this is between us.

34:51.522 --> 34:52.887
Leave these people out of it.

34:52.989 --> 34:54.617
l know what you're doing--

34:54.692 --> 34:56.751
an alliance with these aliens.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.489
We were trading with them,
nothing more.

34:58.563 --> 35:00.360
You expect me to believe that?

35:00.465 --> 35:03.332
You plan to use this ship
to destroy us.

35:03.367 --> 35:06.928
We wouldn't need help
if we wanted to destroy you.

35:07.004 --> 35:09.097
We didn't realize you were
fighting with the Vaskans.

35:09.173 --> 35:10.765
Now, lay down your weapons,

35:10.842 --> 35:13.276
and l promise
you won't be harmed.

35:18.516 --> 35:19.175
No!

35:29.961 --> 35:30.950
He's dead.

35:34.765 --> 35:37.063
Computer, freeze program.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.602
A tragic, needless death,

35:38.669 --> 35:41.832
but, as you can see,
Voyager was not responsible.

35:41.939 --> 35:43.531
After Tedran was killed,

35:43.608 --> 35:46.509
Voyager was attacked
by nine Kyrian ships.

35:46.577 --> 35:48.135
My program was disabled,

35:48.212 --> 35:50.874
most likely when they stole
my backup module.

35:50.948 --> 35:52.074
The next thing l knew,

35:52.150 --> 35:54.141
l was standing
next to this gentleman,

35:54.218 --> 35:55.412
seven centuries later.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.612
Very entertaining.

35:56.687 --> 35:58.314
l'll admit your holo- technology
is new to me.

35:58.389 --> 36:00.152
l had to extrapolate
in a few places,

36:00.258 --> 36:02.055
but l assure you, this is
an accurate re- creation.

36:02.093 --> 36:04.857
Perhaps. Or perhaps
it's the fabrication

36:04.929 --> 36:07.762
of a war criminal
who's afraid for his life.

36:07.865 --> 36:11.392
Do you have any evidence
to support your explanation?

36:11.469 --> 36:13.369
ln fact, l do.

36:13.437 --> 36:17.100
l've confirmed that this
is the same tricorder

36:17.175 --> 36:19.769
l used to scan Tedran
at the moment of his death.

36:19.911 --> 36:22.004
lf l can access
the bio- readings inside,

36:22.079 --> 36:24.445
l can prove that he was killed
by a Vaskan weapon,

36:24.515 --> 36:26.244
not by Captain Janeway.

36:26.317 --> 36:27.909
Can this be done?

36:27.985 --> 36:30.545
l've been trying to decipher
the instrument for years,

36:30.621 --> 36:32.088
but with the Doctor's help...

36:32.156 --> 36:33.646
l fail to see what
this would prove.

36:33.724 --> 36:35.521
Tedran died on Voyager,

36:35.593 --> 36:38.061
a victim of a conspiracy
to oppress my people.

36:38.129 --> 36:41.565
The weapon used, who fired it--
this is all beside the point.

36:41.632 --> 36:43.224
Was there a conspiracy?

36:43.301 --> 36:45.326
Did Voyager really help
my ancestors

36:45.403 --> 36:46.768
to start the Great War,

36:46.837 --> 36:48.805
or were Kyrians the aggressors,

36:48.873 --> 36:50.363
as my people have always
believed?

36:50.441 --> 36:53.137
No, this casts doubt
on everything.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.372
But it doesn't change
the fact that my children

36:55.446 --> 36:57.676
can't attend the same academies
as yours,

36:57.748 --> 37:01.206
or that we are forced to live
outside of the city center.

37:01.285 --> 37:03.753
Today's problems
are not at issue here.

37:03.821 --> 37:05.220
This is about history.

37:05.289 --> 37:07.416
Look, l don't know
who started your war.

37:07.491 --> 37:09.891
All l'm saying is that
Voyager wasn't responsible.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.759
l can't believe
that you would cooperate

37:12.830 --> 37:15.663
with this murderer--
you, of all people.

37:15.733 --> 37:16.893
You built this museum.

37:16.968 --> 37:20.165
The facts are turning out to be
more complex than l expected.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.866
We shouldn't be listening
to this hologram.

37:22.940 --> 37:24.669
l want him arrested and charged

37:24.742 --> 37:26.767
for the crimes
we know he committed.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.776
That's not your decision
to make.

37:28.846 --> 37:30.575
No, it's not, is it?

37:30.648 --> 37:32.081
l'm only on this commission

37:32.149 --> 37:34.049
because you needed
a token Kyrian.

37:34.118 --> 37:35.745
Please.
This isn't about race.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.082
lt's always about race.

37:37.989 --> 37:40.082
You seize every opportunity

37:40.157 --> 37:42.318
to keep yourselves in power.

37:42.393 --> 37:43.917
l'm sorry you see it that way.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.257
l think we are obligated

37:45.329 --> 37:47.194
to hear what the Doctor
has to say.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.527
Proceed with your investigation.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.931
Yes, Arbiter.

37:52.470 --> 37:56.463
You'll pay for your crimes.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.478
700 years, and l'm still caught

38:03.547 --> 38:05.515
in the middle
of your little dispute.

38:05.583 --> 38:06.743
One might have hoped

38:06.851 --> 38:09.149
for a bit of social progress
in the interim.

38:09.220 --> 38:11.017
Change never comes
easily for us.

38:11.088 --> 38:12.749
Humph. That's an understatement.

38:12.857 --> 38:15.655
l've entered the specifications
that you gave me.

38:15.726 --> 38:17.853
Let's give it a try.

38:20.164 --> 38:21.324
Close enough.

38:21.399 --> 38:24.095
This diagnostic tool
should help me get past

38:24.168 --> 38:26.159
the initial
encryption sequences.

38:26.237 --> 38:28.501
Too bad we can't re- create
B'Elanna Torres.

38:28.572 --> 38:31.541
Torres...the Chief
Transporter Operator.

38:31.609 --> 38:33.167
Chief Engineer.

38:33.244 --> 38:34.677
You might want to make

38:34.745 --> 38:37.043
the correction
in your history books.

38:38.749 --> 38:40.410
What was she like-- Torres?

38:40.484 --> 38:43.544
l suppose we've gotten
her personality wrong, too.

38:43.621 --> 38:45.612
Starting to believe
me, are you?

38:45.690 --> 38:50.650
Well, let's just say l'm
trying to keep an open mind.

38:50.728 --> 38:52.821
B'Elanna Torres...

38:52.897 --> 38:54.489
intelligent, beautiful,

38:54.565 --> 38:56.829
and with a chip on her shoulder

38:56.901 --> 38:59.699
the size
of the Horsehead Nebula.

38:59.770 --> 39:03.638
She also had
a kind of vulnerability

39:03.741 --> 39:05.402
that made her...

39:05.443 --> 39:07.308
quite endearing.

39:07.378 --> 39:09.005
You miss her...

39:09.080 --> 39:10.411
and the others.

39:10.481 --> 39:12.039
From my perspective,

39:12.116 --> 39:14.983
l saw them all
only a few days ago.

39:15.052 --> 39:17.748
But in fact,
it's been centuries.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.847
And l'll never see them again.

39:22.993 --> 39:26.190
Did they ever reach home?

39:26.263 --> 39:28.754
l wonder.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.663
l've always wondered that, too.

39:30.735 --> 39:33.863
From as far back
as l can remember.

39:33.938 --> 39:35.337
Really?

39:37.308 --> 39:39.674
Ever since
l was a small child,

39:39.744 --> 39:42.542
the first time l heard
the name Voyager,

39:42.613 --> 39:46.481
it conjured up my imagination.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.575
Even though we were
the bad guys?

39:48.652 --> 39:50.017
That didn't matter.

39:50.087 --> 39:53.682
l was too young
to understand the implications.

39:53.758 --> 39:56.352
The fact that you were
so far from home,

39:56.427 --> 39:58.827
traveling across the stars.

39:58.896 --> 40:01.831
Oh, l found it all very heroic.

40:01.932 --> 40:03.729
l suppose Voyager

40:03.801 --> 40:06.770
is what made me fall in love
with history.

40:06.837 --> 40:10.273
lf it means anything to you,

40:10.341 --> 40:13.469
you would have made
a fine member of our crew.

40:19.116 --> 40:22.313
l hope that's part
of the simulation.

40:22.386 --> 40:24.320
No, it isn't.

41:05.930 --> 41:06.919
No! Stop this!

41:06.997 --> 41:08.396
We know about the hologram!

41:08.466 --> 41:10.058
This museum's filled with lies!

41:10.134 --> 41:11.465
Stop! Listen to me!

41:11.535 --> 41:13.025
We've listened long enough!

41:14.004 --> 41:16.632
They're using photon grenades.

41:16.707 --> 41:17.969
We've got to take cover.

41:18.042 --> 41:19.339
This way.

41:39.930 --> 41:40.897
What's happening?

41:40.998 --> 41:42.431
l've been hearing weapons.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.524
lt's getting worse.

41:43.601 --> 41:44.829
Protests, vandalism...

41:44.902 --> 41:46.426
two people have been killed.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.028
Don't worry.
They've cordoned off the museum.

41:48.105 --> 41:49.436
We're safe for now.

41:49.507 --> 41:50.906
That's not
what l'm concerned about.

41:50.975 --> 41:53.535
Two deaths, a race riot,
all because of me?

41:55.446 --> 41:56.879
You were only the catalyst.

41:56.947 --> 41:58.812
The pressure's been
building for years.

41:58.883 --> 42:01.181
lt was only a matter of time
before something set it off.

42:01.285 --> 42:02.445
Have you found the tricorder?

42:02.486 --> 42:03.418
Not yet.

42:03.487 --> 42:04.818
lt's crucial that we do.

42:04.889 --> 42:08.154
The Kyrians are demanding
you be punished for your crimes,

42:08.325 --> 42:11.021
but the Vaskans want to hear
your version of events again.

42:11.095 --> 42:12.619
They want to continue
the investigation.

42:12.696 --> 42:14.186
What's going to happen?

42:14.265 --> 42:15.789
l don't know.

42:15.866 --> 42:19.233
The Vaskans are more powerful,
but the Kyrians are very angry.

42:19.303 --> 42:21.168
They're talking
about another war.

42:21.238 --> 42:23.968
Then there's only one solution.

42:24.041 --> 42:27.408
Delete my program.

42:27.478 --> 42:30.003
l've become a kind of symbol
for this conflict.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.206
As long as l'm around,

42:31.282 --> 42:34.183
your people are going
to keep on fighting.

42:34.251 --> 42:35.878
l'll show you
how to decompile my program.

42:35.953 --> 42:37.978
You can say l was damaged
in the attack last night.

42:38.055 --> 42:39.113
No one will hold you
responsible.

42:39.189 --> 42:40.349
l can't do that to you.

42:40.424 --> 42:41.721
Then l'll do it myself.

42:41.792 --> 42:42.724
No!

42:42.793 --> 42:44.260
l'm a medical hologram...

42:44.328 --> 42:45.795
programmed to do no harm,

42:45.863 --> 42:49.026
but l'm doing harm
on a global scale.

42:49.099 --> 42:51.033
Ever since you reactivated
me, l've been concerned

42:51.101 --> 42:52.898
with clearing
Voyager's good name.

42:52.970 --> 42:54.403
But that's not important now.

42:54.471 --> 42:55.733
There's more at stake.

42:55.806 --> 42:59.242
A few days ago,
l might have agreed with you.

42:59.310 --> 43:00.937
But what about the facts?

43:01.045 --> 43:02.512
Facts be damned!

43:02.546 --> 43:05.947
Names, dates, places--
it's all open to interpretation.

43:06.016 --> 43:08.314
Who's to say
what really happened?

43:08.385 --> 43:11.616
And ultimately,
what difference does it make?

43:11.689 --> 43:15.625
What matters is today and
the future of your people.

43:15.693 --> 43:16.990
Doctor, you were there.

43:17.061 --> 43:18.688
You can't deny what happened.

43:18.762 --> 43:21.993
l can...and l will.

43:22.066 --> 43:24.933
Tedran was a martyr
for your people, a hero,

43:25.002 --> 43:27.470
a symbol of your struggle
for freedom.

43:27.538 --> 43:29.699
Who am l to wander in
700 years later

43:29.773 --> 43:31.434
and take that away from you?

43:31.508 --> 43:33.442
History has been abused!

43:33.510 --> 43:36.877
We keep blaming each other
for what happened in the past.

43:36.981 --> 43:43.284
lf you don't help us now,
it could be another 700 years.

43:48.092 --> 43:50.754
Let's find that tricorder.

44:03.674 --> 44:06.507
lt was a pivotal moment
in our history.

44:09.346 --> 44:11.906
As a result
of the Doctor's testimony,

44:11.982 --> 44:15.315
a dialogue was opened
between our peoples.

44:15.386 --> 44:17.320
Eventually, we found
a new respect

44:17.388 --> 44:20.448
for our divergent cultures
and traditions.

44:20.524 --> 44:23.493
The efforts of people
like Quarren and the Doctor

44:23.560 --> 44:26.222
paved the way for unity.

44:26.296 --> 44:28.230
Quarren died six years later,

44:28.298 --> 44:32.792
but he lived long enough
to witness the Dawn of Harmony.

44:32.870 --> 44:34.235
And the Doctor...

44:34.304 --> 44:39.264
well, he served as our Surgical
Chancellor for many years,

44:39.343 --> 44:41.573
until he decided to leave.

44:41.645 --> 44:43.806
He took a small craft
and set a course

44:43.881 --> 44:45.678
for the Alpha Quadrant,

44:45.749 --> 44:48.877
attempting to trace
the path of Voyager.

44:48.986 --> 44:51.853
He said he had a longing...

44:51.922 --> 44:53.787
for home.

44:54.792 --> 44:56.225
This way.
