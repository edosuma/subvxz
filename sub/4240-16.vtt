Parent-teacher
conference night,
about a month ago.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.918
I always accompany my father
to those conferences
to act as translator.

this is not organic?

Meet Carole Hudson.
Ms. Hudson,
my father, Burt Hummel.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.597
You both have dead spouses.
Maybe you should talk.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.475
I was just saying to a friend
that acid wash
should make a comeback.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.561
Oh. Really?
And who said it ever left?

11:27.687 --> 11:31.190
[Kurt]
It was an instant connection.
[Laughs] Yeah!

11:31.316 --> 11:34.610
That's impossible.
Nothing is impossible
when it comes to love.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.613
Haven't you noticed
anything different
about your mom?

11:37.697 --> 11:41.158
New clothes, new makeup,
a haircut that doesn't look
like it was styled by the Amish.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.786
Who do you think
"Pretty Woman"-ed her up?

11:43.912 --> 11:45.746
Has she started selling
the furniture yet?
Yeah, yeah.

11:45.830 --> 11:50.709
She got rid of her old bedroom set
and she tried to sell my
dad's chair, but I stopped her.

11:50.835 --> 11:54.755
How do you even know that?
People our parents' age don't
wait around for love to bloom.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.882

11:56.966 --> 11:59.843

I want us to decide
how to redecorate
our room together.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.059
That's why I asked you
about the swatches.

12:07.143 --> 12:10.312

I have a lovely chaise picked out.

with my father...

into a wholly unnecessary
tailspin of despair.

inside that counts.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.927
It's an honor, Coach.

38:25.011 --> 38:28.681
When this hits the stands,
it could mean
big things for you.

[School Bell Rings]

38:37.691 --> 38:42.069
What are you doing here?
Did you already move in?
No, your mom invited me.

38:42.195 --> 38:45.990
She thought you and I
could have a man-to-man.
Good, 'cause I got a lot to say.

38:46.074 --> 38:49.034
I don't,
so let me go first.

38:49.119 --> 38:52.329
You're pissed.
I get it.

38:52.414 --> 38:54.498
Your dad is a hero,

38:54.582 --> 38:57.501
not only to the world
for what he did
in Desert Storm,

38:57.585 --> 39:00.462
but he's a hero to you.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.631
No way
I can fill his shoes.

39:04.759 --> 39:07.970
It's just, you know-
I love your mom.

39:09.931 --> 39:14.351
She's like this angel
that came down to wake me up
after all these years,

39:14.436 --> 39:17.354
and I swear to you
I will never hurt her.

39:17.439 --> 39:20.315
I will always
take care of her.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.318
I can't be your dad,
but I will be her hero...

39:23.403 --> 39:26.488
for as long as she'll take me.

39:28.533 --> 39:31.285
All right, I've said my piece.
What do you want to say?

39:34.122 --> 39:37.791
Just wanted to know
if you wanted to watch a game.

39:40.837 --> 39:42.963
Sure.

39:48.303 --> 39:49.970
Hold up.

39:52.599 --> 39:54.975

if you want.

Tell me about it.

This team, every year,
they recruit these guys and...

they don't know
that the, uh, entire college...

40:27.842 --> 40:32.012

built on tobacco—

[School Bell Rings]
I don't know what to say.

40:34.349 --> 40:37.017
Just say congratulations.
I took your advice.

40:37.102 --> 40:40.020
I went home, I told Buddy
that if he wanted
to keep me around...

40:40.105 --> 40:42.981
he had to ditch the old lady
and give yours truly
the top job.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.318
And then he died.
[Laughs]

40:46.402 --> 40:48.946
One of his eyes went all funny
and he had a stroke
right in front of me.

40:49.072 --> 40:52.116
Geez, April,
are you okay?
Okay? I'm rich!

40:52.200 --> 40:55.077
The ol' battle-ax was afraid
I'd go to the Lima Times,

40:55.203 --> 40:58.455
so she shut me up
to the tune of $2 million.
What?

40:58.540 --> 41:01.458
So I'm sobering up
and I'm heading
to the Broadway, Will.

I haven't had a drink
in 45 minutes.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.838
I'm going to
take my hush money...

41:05.922 --> 41:10.717
and I'm going to mount
the first-ever all-white
production of The Wiz.

41:10.844 --> 41:13.137
Okay.
[Chuckles]
And I've got you to thank.

41:13.221 --> 41:16.056
- Did you tell him yet?
- Tell me what?

41:16.182 --> 41:19.017
That I bought y'all
the auditorium.
