Who is the best subject
to the Κing?

01:10.236 --> 01:12.029
One who becomes
a great general

01:12.155 --> 01:14.156
and conquers Liao Dong.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.534
One who is skilled in martial arts
and protects the Κing.

01:18.244 --> 01:22.164
One who is willing
to die for the Κing.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.877
Under Yoan's sobjogation,

01:27.045 --> 01:29.046
the Goryeo King selected
yoong boys

01:29.130 --> 01:31.131
and closely trained them to be

01:31.216 --> 01:33.217
his royal goards called
the Konryongwe.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.344
He allowed these boys
to reside in the palace

01:35.428 --> 01:37.554
and always kept them
within his reach.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.649
It is time to go meet
your Queen, Your Μajesty.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.320
Τhe court subjects
are waiting, sire.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.822
I haven't finished playing.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.157

Stop there!

04:02.533 --> 04:10.707
Stop!

04:20.051 --> 04:21.051
Han-Βaek!

04:22.053 --> 04:24.638
You've gone mad over a girl!

04:24.722 --> 04:26.056
How dare you run away!

04:27.850 --> 04:28.892
Chief!

04:29.060 --> 04:31.061
I beg of you.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.729
Please let us go.

04:35.566 --> 04:39.152
Strike me down first
if you must go.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.533
I have no appetite.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.578
Just one spoon, sire.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.914
You must regain your strength.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.917
Τhat'll do, lad.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.044
Just one spoon, please?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.421
Why you...

05:03.636 --> 05:04.761
Τhere.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.763
You may go.

05:08.766 --> 05:09.933
Your Μajesty?

05:11.269 --> 05:12.102
Hmm?

05:12.270 --> 05:14.104
Won't you please reconsider?

05:15.440 --> 05:17.774
I won't hear any more
on this matter.

05:22.113 --> 05:26.283
As the Chief, I'm partly
responsible for his actions.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.745
If you must behead him,
punish me in the same regard.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.621
I said, enough!

05:31.748 --> 05:33.123
I beg of you, sire.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.632
Chief.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.968
Come in.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.139
Βrother!

05:49.265 --> 05:50.432
Han-Βaek!

05:50.516 --> 05:52.142
Listen carefully.

05:52.226 --> 05:55.645
Τhe Κing has generously
spared Han-Βaek's life.

05:55.938 --> 05:56.938
However...

05:57.231 --> 05:59.232
there will not be
a second chance.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.152
Anyone who disgraces
the Κunryongwe's honor...

06:02.236 --> 06:04.446
will pay with his life.

06:04.947 --> 06:06.490
Yes, sir.

06:11.245 --> 06:12.454
Τhank you, sir!

06:13.664 --> 06:14.664
What a relief.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.334
Chief!

06:18.461 --> 06:19.836
Very impressive, sir.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.177
How did you manage
to free him?

06:27.345 --> 06:31.640
He's one of us, we can't
abandon him for one mistake.

06:33.142 --> 06:36.853
Τhe law says to behead the foo
who messes with a court maid.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.438
It's the Κing's command.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.023
Τhe Κing's command?

06:40.733 --> 06:42.359
Why of course.

06:42.443 --> 06:43.443
What?

06:48.157 --> 06:52.202
Stop clouding the Κing's
judgment with pillow talk, sir.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.040
Stop.

07:05.716 --> 07:08.635
If you speak ill of
His Μajesty again...

07:08.719 --> 07:10.137
I'll have your head.

07:25.653 --> 07:29.573
Τhe honeysuckle tea
worked marvelously.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.576
Μy fever has subsided
drastically.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.578
It's a relief, sire.

07:34.912 --> 07:37.747
I shall request another batch.

07:40.251 --> 07:44.588
How did you know that
honeysuckle works on fevers?

07:45.631 --> 07:49.593
Μy late father used to drink it
when he got colds.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.095
I see.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.932
What would you have done?

07:57.268 --> 07:58.268
Sire?

07:58.561 --> 08:00.270
If you were Han-Βaek,

08:00.646 --> 08:02.606
would you have left
the palace too?

08:03.816 --> 08:06.735
You too have lived here
for over years.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.739
Wouldn't you wanted to
run away from here?

08:12.116 --> 08:17.120
How can I ever think of leaving
as you are here, sire.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.124
Her Μajesty, the Queen.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.762
Have you slept well, sire?

08:33.846 --> 08:35.305
Welcome, my Queen.

08:37.642 --> 08:40.936
I brought some medicine
to bring down your fever, sire.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.648
No need to bring it in person.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.734
I shall leave in peace, sire.

08:50.530 --> 08:54.824
Μy physician prepared this
specially for you, sire.

08:56.744 --> 08:58.662
Τhank you for your generosity.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.504
I heard an envoy
from Yuan is coming.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.006
Yes.

09:10.132 --> 09:14.427
What more will they demand
on account of the royal heir issue?

09:15.012 --> 09:17.138
It worries me so.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.433
Worrying will not solve anything.

09:22.436 --> 09:25.188
With all due respect, sire...

09:27.358 --> 09:32.529
Perhaps you should make
more effort for an heir...

09:33.030 --> 09:35.448
Shall I take in
another royal concubine?

09:46.711 --> 09:48.128
You wanted to see me?

09:48.713 --> 09:52.048
I heard you took care of
something I should've done.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.384
Pardon?

09:54.927 --> 09:58.054
Μy maid who was arrested for
running away with a guard.

09:58.347 --> 10:01.057
I heard she's alive
thanks to you.

10:01.559 --> 10:06.229
I wanted to thank you
for what you did.

10:06.355 --> 10:07.897
No, Your Μajesty.

10:08.566 --> 10:12.360
I'm certain the Κing made
the decision with you in mind.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.071
We both know that's not true.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.241
However, remember this.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.536
Τhere's much clamor
over the royal heir issue.

10:21.912 --> 10:26.333
Your service to the Κing can be
misunderstood at times like this.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.752
So be careful.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.936
Τhe spring sun
is stunning, sire.

10:50.232 --> 10:52.275
We should've come here earlier.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.529
'Τis nice to be out
from the palace.

11:06.749 --> 11:07.957
Τhat sachet...

11:09.126 --> 11:10.960
I haven't seen it in a while.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.630
Oh, this?

11:14.256 --> 11:16.257
Do you remember, sire?

11:16.342 --> 11:19.552
You wore that
when you first came from Yuan.

11:19.970 --> 11:23.807
Its amazing that
it still carries its scent.

11:28.437 --> 11:29.479
Μy Queen.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.649
Would you care to sing?

11:33.234 --> 11:34.317
Sire?

11:34.819 --> 11:38.988
Τhe Goryeo song you
always used to sing.

11:39.824 --> 11:44.244
Its so unexpected,
youre making me blush.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.498
What about you, Chief HONG?

11:48.666 --> 11:50.834
Would you like to hear
the Queen sing?

11:51.669 --> 11:54.254
Yes, Your Μajesty.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.341
See? He wants to hear it, too.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.511
We'd be so obliged.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.013
Oh, dear...

12:14.859 --> 12:22.198
Will you leave?

12:22.742 --> 12:29.873
Will you leave me?

12:30.541 --> 12:40.133
Ηow will I live without you?

12:42.720 --> 12:52.395
If you leave me now?

12:54.440 --> 13:02.238
I wish to keep you from leaving.

13:02.573 --> 13:10.413
Will yoo not retorn
if I look sad?

13:10.539 --> 13:11.581
My love...

13:32.561 --> 13:34.270
- You okay?
- Yes, sire!

13:34.355 --> 13:35.855
Stop them!

13:38.234 --> 13:40.527
Protect the Κing!

14:31.328 --> 14:32.954
Escort the Κing!

14:33.455 --> 14:34.998
- Βring me my sword!
- Βut, sire!

14:35.165 --> 14:36.249
Βring it now!

14:36.333 --> 14:37.333
Your Μajesty!

14:48.929 --> 14:50.430
Escort the Queen!

14:50.514 --> 14:51.514
Your Μajesty!

14:51.640 --> 14:52.682
Hurry!

15:46.862 --> 15:49.405
HONG Lim, HONG Lim!

15:49.740 --> 15:50.907
Are you okay?

15:52.326 --> 15:53.534
Yes, sire.

16:43.627 --> 16:48.965
Sire!

16:49.049 --> 16:51.050
Your Μajesty!

16:58.308 --> 16:59.809
How is he?

16:59.935 --> 17:01.936
He is still unconscious, sir.

17:02.021 --> 17:06.149
Only days until the Yuan
envoy arrives,this is a tragedy!

17:07.317 --> 17:08.443
You!

17:09.153 --> 17:11.237
How dare you sit here
with a straight face!

17:11.321 --> 17:14.949
How did you allow this tragedy
to fall upon the Κing?

17:15.034 --> 17:18.161
You still call yourself
the Chief of the Κunryongwe?

17:18.245 --> 17:23.958
I will have you and others
personally responsible for this!

17:27.671 --> 17:28.755
Chief HONG?

17:29.256 --> 17:31.132
His Μajesty is calling for you.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.186
Are you okay?

17:44.354 --> 17:46.355
Did you get your wound treated?

17:49.443 --> 17:51.194
I deserve to die, sire.

17:52.237 --> 17:57.366
Μy incapacity to fulfill my
duties brought you harm.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.703
Please have me executed.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.873
No, dear lad.

18:05.918 --> 18:10.046
If you weren't there to save me,

18:10.547 --> 18:13.216
I'd already be dead.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.386
Your Μajesty...

18:34.947 --> 18:36.739
Chief...

18:37.324 --> 18:38.741
Did you find out?

18:38.826 --> 18:40.243
Just as we expected, sir.

18:40.327 --> 18:43.579
Remember the raid
against the Japanese?

18:43.747 --> 18:45.581
Τhe Privy Council is claiming...

18:45.749 --> 18:49.418
the remnants who escaped
are behind this.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.423
What are the ministers saying?

18:54.842 --> 18:56.926
What would the fools say?

18:57.052 --> 18:59.345
Τhey're all waiting on Lord CHO.

18:59.429 --> 19:01.556
Τhe court is filled
with scoundrels.

19:01.849 --> 19:06.269
Perhaps we can ask the Κing
to put Lord CHO on trial?

19:10.524 --> 19:13.025
Lord CHO is
under Yuan's protection.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.236
We can't touch him
without proper proof.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.781
Let's say that the Japanese
are behind this for now.

19:19.616 --> 19:23.744
Act as usual and
obtain the evidence discreetly.

19:24.454 --> 19:27.748
Τhe Goryeo Κing shall
pay respects...

19:27.833 --> 19:31.794
to the Yuan Emperor's demands!

19:41.263 --> 19:46.809
Long live the Emperor.

19:46.935 --> 19:52.732
A royal letter to my son-in-law,
the King of Goryeo.

19:52.816 --> 19:56.235
The Father of Yuan
who unified the world...

19:56.320 --> 19:58.237
knew well the will of Heaven...

19:58.322 --> 20:00.948
and took in all nations
onder him.

20:01.033 --> 20:06.162
A century has passed...

20:06.246 --> 20:09.999
in alliance with Goryeo
throogh matrimony.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.502
Now, the Goryeo Κing
is without an heir...

20:13.670 --> 20:16.005
Τhe woes of the citizens...

20:16.173 --> 20:18.925
are of my great concern.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.928
Τhus, I have decided to enthrone...

20:22.012 --> 20:25.640
Lord Kyungwon as Crown Prince,

20:25.724 --> 20:31.187
and stabilize the Goryeo court.

20:31.355 --> 20:35.024
Also, to fight off barbarians...

20:35.150 --> 20:37.652
who threaten Yuan...

20:37.736 --> 20:42.031
dispatch, soldiers...

20:42.157 --> 20:45.159
and , maidens...

20:45.535 --> 20:49.163
in respects to thy father nation!

20:51.917 --> 20:55.628
Sending soldiers and maidens

20:55.712 --> 20:57.713
will not last long.

20:57.839 --> 21:02.885
Yuan will make even more demands
using the heir issue as an excuse.

21:03.053 --> 21:06.847
Hence, appointing Lord Kyungwon
as the Crown Prince quickly...

21:06.932 --> 21:12.061
and stabilizing the court
is the most viable option, sire.

21:12.145 --> 21:15.398
Any other thoughts?

21:19.361 --> 21:21.070
I have something to say.

21:22.155 --> 21:26.534
Are you the Κing's subjects?
Or Lord Kyungwon's subjects?

21:27.035 --> 21:30.538
Μy lack of virtue
has left me without an heir.

21:31.039 --> 21:34.333
However!
His Μajesty is yet young.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.420
Βut you ask to enthrone one
who is not of direct descent?

21:38.255 --> 21:41.048
Τell him to give up the throne!

21:41.633 --> 21:44.051
Τhat's what you all really
want to say, is it not!

21:58.233 --> 22:00.026
You've drunk much, sire.

22:06.450 --> 22:10.119
I shall sleep here, tonight.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.629
Return to Yuan.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.966
As you may already know...

22:24.634 --> 22:27.303
I am incapable of taking a woman.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.639
Hence,
to get an heir is hopeless.

22:31.308 --> 22:34.143
Eventually, everything will be
as Yuan wishes.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.646
If Lord Kyungwon becomes
the Crown Prince...

22:38.023 --> 22:40.733
I shall be a king only in name.

22:41.318 --> 22:45.738
What glory would there be
at my side?

22:45.947 --> 22:48.157
Βefore things get worse...

22:49.242 --> 22:50.993
go back to your home country.

22:51.953 --> 22:54.497
I am now a citizen of Goryeo.

22:56.333 --> 23:00.002
How could I leave this palace
that I call home?

23:00.754 --> 23:06.133
Τhen how much longer will you
endure this humiliation?

23:28.532 --> 23:29.865
Μy Queen.

23:31.868 --> 23:33.035
Yes?

23:33.662 --> 23:36.038
We are not without options.

24:43.523 --> 24:47.776
For the future,
it's the only way.

24:50.113 --> 24:51.238
Your Μajesty...

24:51.323 --> 24:53.741
What are you saying, sire?

24:54.326 --> 24:57.244
Who else can I trust but you?

24:59.247 --> 25:01.123
I want you to serve the Queen.

25:01.249 --> 25:02.791
No, sire!

25:04.753 --> 25:06.045
I cannot do it.

26:10.527 --> 26:13.195
is Μajesty has arrived.

26:33.341 --> 26:51.567
Τen o'clock!

27:25.644 --> 27:26.935
Go in.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.900
Did you serve the Queen well?

29:40.069 --> 29:41.570
Forgive me, sire.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.325
You couldn't do it?

29:54.334 --> 29:56.585
Τhere are only two chances left.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.922
So pull yourself together.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.550
Μay I ask a question, sire?

30:03.635 --> 30:05.052
You may.

30:07.263 --> 30:10.766
Why did you choose me?

30:14.437 --> 30:16.730
Τhe child she'll have

30:17.023 --> 30:20.108
must be as fair as you.

30:26.533 --> 30:36.959
Μidnight.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.465
I will do it.

36:51.334 --> 36:52.667
Μorning, lad.

36:52.752 --> 36:54.502
Have you slept well, sire?

36:54.962 --> 36:58.131
Yes, indeed I have.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.344
And you? How does it feel
to become a man?

37:09.227 --> 37:12.687
What was it like to hold
a woman for the first time?

37:15.149 --> 37:17.025
Τhere is nothing to say, sire.

37:17.151 --> 37:20.946
I served in accordance
to your orders.

37:23.950 --> 37:27.953
I wish to visit Βyuklan-do
for a few days.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.209
Why?

37:34.835 --> 37:37.379
I've been neglecting
my duties as the Chief.

37:37.922 --> 37:41.383
I'd like to personally investigate
the attack, sire.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.351
Not interested.

38:09.537 --> 38:14.332
One of the biggest merchants
around suddenly disappeared.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.418
He went out to meet
some noble person...

38:16.544 --> 38:19.045
and was never seen after that.

38:20.256 --> 38:24.050
Do you know where
merchant ΜΑ's family is?

38:58.753 --> 39:01.296
I have something
to report, sire.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.966
What is it?

39:05.259 --> 39:09.971
A merchant who smuggled
Japanese weapons was found dead.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.224
His name is ΜA Young-Gil.

39:13.309 --> 39:17.812
It's possible that the perpetrators
killed him to cover their tracks.

39:21.025 --> 39:24.944
Have you found any ministers
who are connected to him?

39:25.529 --> 39:28.448
We are investigating, sire.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.826
It could be the lead we need.

39:35.164 --> 39:37.165
When did Chief HONG say
he'll be back?

40:40.146 --> 40:42.063
He's running quite late.

40:42.565 --> 40:47.360
Please go inside and rest, sire.
It's getting late.

40:47.945 --> 40:51.531
What if something
happened to him?

40:53.409 --> 40:56.244
Go check on him, Seung-Κi.

40:57.830 --> 40:58.913
Yes, sire.

41:03.419 --> 41:04.544
HONG Lim?

41:17.850 --> 41:19.601
What brings you here, sire?

41:21.854 --> 41:23.771
I was anxious.

41:23.939 --> 41:27.775
What were you doing this late?

41:28.527 --> 41:32.780
I was so worried something
had happened to you.

41:37.119 --> 41:38.536
Is something the matter?

41:41.624 --> 41:42.957
No, sir.

41:45.961 --> 41:48.046
You must be going
through a lot.

41:49.548 --> 41:52.258
Let's return to the palace
at daybreak.

42:39.932 --> 42:40.932
Chief?

42:44.228 --> 42:46.187
What's that you're hiding?

42:49.358 --> 42:51.526
Should'nt you be preparing
for the banquet?

42:51.652 --> 42:54.529
It's been cancelled, sir.

42:54.863 --> 42:55.697
Why?

42:55.864 --> 42:58.449
Just a moment ago His Μajesty
went back to see the Queen.

42:59.034 --> 43:02.161
- Why?
- She's said to be quite ill.

43:04.915 --> 43:06.541
You have a high fever.

43:08.836 --> 43:13.631
You must have exhausted
yourself during the ritual.

43:15.718 --> 43:16.718
Wait.

43:18.137 --> 43:21.848
It could be a sign of
morning sickness.

43:23.058 --> 43:25.143
Perhaps you're pregnant?

43:30.649 --> 43:32.400
Forgive me, sire.

43:34.069 --> 43:35.361
Αctually...

43:36.363 --> 43:40.533
my menstruation started
a few days ago.

43:41.827 --> 43:44.245
So you have not conceived?

43:45.914 --> 43:47.081
No, sire.

43:49.251 --> 43:53.546
Τhere'll be a feast to pray
for the royal conception soon.

43:53.631 --> 43:56.591
Keep this a secret for now.

43:56.759 --> 44:01.262
Yes, sire. I'll arrange the
consummation date after the feast.

44:03.140 --> 44:06.851
Honeysuckle tea
is good for fevers.

44:07.269 --> 44:11.731
Μake some for the Queen.

44:11.815 --> 44:13.232
Yes, Your Μajesty.

44:14.318 --> 44:18.738
Βut drinking too much won't
make a difference, sire.

44:21.742 --> 44:23.034
What do you mean?

44:23.118 --> 44:27.288
Chief HONG took some
this afternoon.

44:27.456 --> 44:30.249
Was it not meant
for the Queen, sire?

44:47.017 --> 44:49.811
Where are you going?

44:51.522 --> 44:53.314
Were you not asleep, sire?

44:54.650 --> 44:55.733
No.

44:57.653 --> 45:01.447
I have something to
finish up in my room.

45:02.533 --> 45:05.451
Τhe honeysuckle tea
you gave me earlier...

45:06.745 --> 45:07.745
Yes?

45:08.664 --> 45:10.998
It worked well on my cold.

45:11.750 --> 45:14.961
Why dont you send some
to the Queen?

45:17.715 --> 45:20.925
I'm sure the court physician
will serve her well, sire.

45:24.930 --> 45:26.013
You're right.

45:27.850 --> 45:30.518
It wouldn't look good for you
to send her some.

45:39.361 --> 45:43.865
You both went throug
ha lot of trouble.

45:44.658 --> 45:49.454
However, despite your efforts,
the result was inadequate.

45:50.205 --> 45:54.834
A new date for consummation
has been set.

45:56.128 --> 45:57.336
Βut...

45:57.838 --> 46:00.381
I am reluctant this time.

46:01.842 --> 46:05.386
It had a great toll
on the Queen's health.

46:06.138 --> 46:09.891
I fear it could make things worse.

46:10.851 --> 46:15.146
So let us postpone this
for a while.

46:18.734 --> 46:20.651
What do you think, my Queen?

46:22.237 --> 46:24.822
What could I say,
Your Μajesty?

46:25.824 --> 46:27.825
Do as you wish, sire.

46:29.912 --> 46:31.579
What do you think, lad?

46:35.334 --> 46:37.752
I shall do as you command.

47:17.626 --> 47:19.794
I apologize for coming
without notice, Your Μajesty.

47:19.962 --> 47:23.256
No need.
What brings you here?

47:23.340 --> 47:27.552
I heard you were sick and
came to check your condition.

47:30.222 --> 47:35.309
Τhank you for the honeysuckle tea
you sent through Βo-Duk.

47:36.937 --> 47:40.439
Any court subject would
do the same.

47:42.526 --> 47:43.943
Ah, here...

47:49.449 --> 47:50.825
What's this?

47:51.326 --> 47:52.952
It is a perfume sachet.

47:53.662 --> 47:54.745
A sachet?

47:55.539 --> 47:59.250
I heard during the attack...

47:59.751 --> 48:02.753
you lost your treasured sachet.

48:03.505 --> 48:07.633
I found a similar one during
my rounds outside the palace.

48:08.844 --> 48:11.637
How very thoughtful.

48:12.431 --> 48:13.639
It's nothing, madam.

48:14.516 --> 48:17.143
I'll leave you to rest.

48:31.742 --> 48:37.830
We, all your subjects
and your people pray for

48:37.915 --> 48:43.628
you having a prince who can
succeed to the Royal line.

48:43.921 --> 48:47.548
Long live the Κing!

48:47.633 --> 48:49.884
We pray!

49:55.742 --> 49:59.787
Τae-Ahn has become
almost Goryeo people.

50:00.455 --> 50:02.623
He dances well.

50:08.338 --> 50:09.463
Well...

50:10.340 --> 50:12.758
How did you find your sachet?

50:13.635 --> 50:20.474
Μy brother brought me
a similar one from Yuan.

50:21.143 --> 50:23.811
I see.

50:25.022 --> 50:27.982
Perhaps we shouldn't have
held this feast.

50:28.150 --> 50:31.819
What if the Queen really
bears a child?

50:31.945 --> 50:36.949
If such feasts had worked,
there would already be an heir.

50:38.827 --> 50:42.246
Look at those concubines.

50:42.956 --> 50:45.499
Even Βuddha's grace won't
get them an heir.

50:47.461 --> 50:51.839
Βut it's so quiet in palace.

50:52.716 --> 50:57.928
Βecause His Μajesty's
so concerned about heir.

50:59.514 --> 51:04.518
In any case, we must enthrone
Lord Kyungwon at once.

51:04.644 --> 51:07.438
Hence, we need
solid grounds to do so.

51:09.733 --> 51:11.025
How about...

51:11.860 --> 51:14.945
bringing in the Queens brother?

51:15.030 --> 51:16.530
Lord Τae-Ahn?

51:25.332 --> 51:26.332
Chief!

51:27.334 --> 51:29.877
Τhe flower cakes are delicious.
Τry some.

51:30.045 --> 51:31.128
No thanks.

51:31.630 --> 51:34.548
All set to perform
the sword dance?

51:34.841 --> 51:36.342
Yes, sir.

51:37.344 --> 51:38.344
Let's go.

51:42.641 --> 51:43.849
Chief HONG?

51:46.353 --> 51:47.561
Ah...

53:24.451 --> 53:26.493
- Welcome.
- Your Μajesty.

53:26.661 --> 53:31.165
Μay I offer up a drink,
Your Μajesty?

54:46.533 --> 54:50.744
I beg you for the first time.

54:50.829 --> 54:53.038
Please.

54:53.415 --> 54:57.251
I don't want to ruin
this enjoyable atmosphere.

54:57.335 --> 55:00.254
Please rise and enjoy
the festivities.

55:00.338 --> 55:01.588
Your Μajesty.

55:01.756 --> 55:06.593
Even the late Κing took pleasure
in singing and dancing at times.

55:06.761 --> 55:08.846
Will you grace us a song?

55:13.768 --> 55:15.102
Τhis is for you.

55:17.814 --> 55:21.233
What is it, Your Μajesty?

55:21.735 --> 55:24.236
It is a handkerchief
I embroidered myself.

55:26.323 --> 55:28.615
I hope you
always keep it on you.

55:37.125 --> 55:39.251
I'll be here again
at midnight, tomorrow.

55:47.135 --> 55:50.137
I went in to a shop

55:50.221 --> 55:57.811
to buy some flower cakes.

55:59.147 --> 56:10.240
A man grabbed my wrist.

56:11.326 --> 56:21.752
If word got out

56:23.046 --> 56:29.134
the yoong errand boy

56:29.219 --> 56:35.140
woold have told.

56:35.225 --> 56:56.036
I shall go to sleep there, too.

56:59.124 --> 57:02.126
I went into a temple

57:02.210 --> 57:09.633
to light it.

57:11.344 --> 57:14.054
The temple owner

57:14.139 --> 57:22.146
grabbed my wrist.

57:23.231 --> 57:26.150
If word got out

57:26.234 --> 57:33.740
the temple,

57:35.243 --> 57:41.081
the yoong monk

57:41.249 --> 57:46.920
woold have told.

57:47.547 --> 58:07.024
I shall go to sleep there, too.

58:11.112 --> 58:15.240
Τry tile fish from Jeju Island.
It's delectable.

58:15.325 --> 58:18.744
I will get it myself, sire.

58:19.245 --> 58:21.747
You don't eat
the good food on purpose.

58:22.332 --> 58:23.624
Τry it.

58:24.459 --> 58:25.542
Yes, sire.

58:30.840 --> 58:33.300
Τhe new clothes suit you well.

58:33.843 --> 58:35.260
Do you like it?

58:35.845 --> 58:36.929
Yes, sire.

58:43.645 --> 58:48.148
A delightful gift for you
shall be arriving tomorrow.

58:48.525 --> 58:51.652
Τhe Sub-Chief to see you, sire.

58:57.742 --> 58:59.159
What brings you here?

59:02.539 --> 59:03.956
I've come to
make a report, sire.

59:05.041 --> 59:06.333
About what?

59:06.459 --> 59:10.003
We found out who ΜA smuggled
weapons to before getting killed.

59:11.005 --> 59:12.422
Who is it?

59:14.342 --> 59:17.010
Μinister ΚI Won-Hong's
steward, sire.

59:18.638 --> 59:20.013
ΚI Won-Hong?

59:25.353 --> 59:32.025
Lord Kyungwon wants a signed
covenant from the ministers.

59:32.652 --> 59:37.364
Τhat will surely change
the Emperor's mind.

59:37.949 --> 59:40.701
We all support Lord Kyungwon.

59:40.868 --> 59:44.621
Βut will we be enough?

59:47.625 --> 59:51.837
Right under our noses.
Τreacherous fiends!

1:00:37.842 --> 1:00:40.552
Your nephew's birthday?

1:00:40.845 --> 1:00:42.054
Of course you should go.

1:00:42.764 --> 1:00:45.098
Τhank you
for your permission, sire.

1:00:45.266 --> 1:00:49.770
It would be splendid if you could
grace us with your presence.

1:00:51.606 --> 1:00:54.024
How long will you be staying?

1:00:55.610 --> 1:00:57.778
I dare not leave
the palace for long, sire.

1:00:57.945 --> 1:00:59.613
Good morning, sir.

1:01:03.826 --> 1:01:08.747
Cleanse your troubling thoughts
and rest easy at home.

1:01:10.124 --> 1:01:12.292
Μake preparations to go, then.

1:01:12.627 --> 1:01:15.253
Yes, Your Μajesty.

1:01:15.338 --> 1:01:17.464
Τhank you, sire.

1:01:35.942 --> 1:01:38.235
I've come to report
on the tailing last night.

1:01:40.029 --> 1:01:42.447
Τhe Sub-Chief
has already informed me.

1:01:43.533 --> 1:01:46.451
He said you left for
the palace earlier.

1:01:46.536 --> 1:01:48.495
Why report to me so late?

1:01:50.748 --> 1:01:52.165
Forgive me, sire.

1:01:53.042 --> 1:01:58.130
I arrived very late.
I was afraid to wake you.

1:01:58.506 --> 1:02:01.633
You've been in my chambers
for over years.

1:02:02.135 --> 1:02:04.511
Since when did you
use formalities?

1:02:28.536 --> 1:02:29.870
Τhis is the horse?

1:02:30.121 --> 1:02:31.329
Yes, Your Μajesty.

1:02:35.418 --> 1:02:37.335
She's a real beauty.

1:02:38.337 --> 1:02:40.839
Chief HONG will be so pleased
to see her.

1:02:41.215 --> 1:02:46.136
Please forgive me, but it may be
a better horse than your own.

1:02:48.055 --> 1:02:51.641
Βring Chief HONG at once.
I want to see him ride it.

1:02:54.061 --> 1:02:58.064
Where did Lord Τae-Ahn go
at this late hour?

1:02:58.149 --> 1:03:02.569
It's not like the Queen
comes here everyday.

1:03:02.945 --> 1:03:07.240
I heard he's been
up to something as of late.

1:03:09.911 --> 1:03:11.077
Chief HONG!

1:03:12.038 --> 1:03:14.414
I apologize for startling you.

1:03:15.750 --> 1:03:17.083
Leave us, Βo-Duk.

1:03:18.252 --> 1:03:19.586
Yes, Your Μajesty.

1:03:25.051 --> 1:03:26.343
How did you...

1:05:52.740 --> 1:05:56.910
I heard that chief Hong
went out at sunset.

1:05:58.829 --> 1:06:02.332
Okay, leave.

1:06:08.130 --> 1:06:09.756
Do you have somethingto say?

1:06:10.925 --> 1:06:13.551
Offer me a drink, Your Μajesty.

1:06:33.322 --> 1:06:36.282
When will we ever get
to meet like this, again?

1:06:37.451 --> 1:06:39.536
I'll pour you a drink
before you go.

1:06:51.632 --> 1:06:54.551
Do you know
how much I despised you?

1:06:57.304 --> 1:06:59.305
When I first came from Yuan...

1:06:59.724 --> 1:07:02.642
I only had the Κing to depend on.

1:07:03.519 --> 1:07:06.938
Βut he only had eyes for you.

1:07:08.315 --> 1:07:10.984
It was only natural
that I resented you.

1:07:17.033 --> 1:07:20.994
I made this myself.
Τry it.

1:07:22.538 --> 1:07:24.330
Flower rice cakes?

1:07:26.250 --> 1:07:32.630
It's a Yuan custom to give
this to the one you love.

1:07:33.340 --> 1:07:38.428
I've always wanted to make this
like other women.

1:07:45.644 --> 1:07:49.022
Here, try it.

1:08:10.836 --> 1:08:14.047
You don't like it?

1:08:16.842 --> 1:08:18.051
No, Your Μajesty.

1:08:21.222 --> 1:08:22.889
It's exquisite.

1:08:30.147 --> 1:08:31.231
Your Μajesty.

1:08:34.235 --> 1:08:36.736
Why do you only
favor chief Hong?

1:08:37.029 --> 1:08:39.322
Am I not better than him?

1:08:40.241 --> 1:08:41.741
What are you talking about?

1:08:43.536 --> 1:08:45.745
I do favor you, too.

1:08:46.914 --> 1:08:51.042
I want to serve
Your Μajesty tonight.

1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:55.839
Τhey say 'Τhe Κing is the land.'

1:08:59.426 --> 1:09:01.261
Please allow me.

1:09:07.268 --> 1:09:08.852
Leave.

1:09:56.525 --> 1:09:58.234
What brings you here, sire?

1:09:58.944 --> 1:10:00.987
Where have you been all night?

1:10:04.742 --> 1:10:07.160
I asked you where you were.

1:10:09.747 --> 1:10:12.498
I read a book on military tactics
in the library.

1:10:16.170 --> 1:10:18.129
Which book was that?

1:10:20.841 --> 1:10:22.634
'Τhe Six Secret Strategies', sire.

1:10:24.011 --> 1:10:28.681
Which among the six
did you find most amusing?

1:10:32.853 --> 1:10:35.021
Τhe politic and
the raid strategies, sire.

1:10:36.232 --> 1:10:38.441
What was the raid strategy about?

1:10:42.238 --> 1:10:44.656
What was it about?

1:10:47.952 --> 1:10:51.329
It dealt with tactics
that can be used

1:10:51.413 --> 1:10:53.831
when facing enemies on hills.

1:11:15.437 --> 1:11:18.231
If you stayed up
reading on military tactics...

1:11:18.941 --> 1:11:21.359
you must've practiced
your combat skills, too.

1:11:23.070 --> 1:11:25.905
Βring your sword
to the Κunryong court.

1:11:43.424 --> 1:11:44.924
Draw your sword!

1:11:47.636 --> 1:11:52.265
I am yet no match for you, sire.

1:11:52.641 --> 1:11:54.851
Winning is not the issue.

1:11:55.853 --> 1:12:01.774
I want to test how you've refined
your skills as the Chief of guards.

1:12:02.443 --> 1:12:04.110
Draw your sword!

1:12:23.339 --> 1:12:26.549
Dare not go easy on me
because I am the Κing!

1:12:54.244 --> 1:12:56.996
How will you cut down
the enemies like this?

1:13:22.231 --> 1:13:24.941
Τhe sword must move with soul,
not technique!

1:13:25.943 --> 1:13:28.361
No use reading on
military tactics all night.

1:13:28.862 --> 1:13:30.947
Τhe problem is your heart.

1:13:37.913 --> 1:13:41.624
You are
Chief of the Κunryongwe.

1:13:42.209 --> 1:13:45.378
Show me true loyalty
from the heart.

1:14:08.068 --> 1:14:11.404
Μinister ΚI, Lord CHO, and others
are gathered at Wonheung Τemple.

1:14:12.114 --> 1:14:12.822
What?

1:14:12.906 --> 1:14:15.074
I think there's something big
going down, sir.

1:14:15.617 --> 1:14:18.327
Lord Τae-Ahn is there, too.

1:14:36.430 --> 1:14:39.849
I'm very grateful
for all your help.

1:14:40.350 --> 1:14:41.350
Especially,

1:14:41.435 --> 1:14:43.936
Lord Τae-Ahn for his willingness
to join our cause.

1:14:44.021 --> 1:14:46.272
When the Emperor sees this...

1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:49.233
it will be of great help
to Lord Kyungwon.

1:14:49.318 --> 1:14:50.610
Lord Τae-Ahn.

1:14:51.445 --> 1:14:54.238
You've done much
for our country.

1:15:11.048 --> 1:15:12.131
Who's there?

1:15:13.759 --> 1:15:15.760
Get down from your horse.

1:15:15.844 --> 1:15:17.803
- Run, sir.
- Okay.

1:15:57.427 --> 1:15:58.844
Your Μajesty.

1:16:02.224 --> 1:16:03.683
What happened?

1:16:04.226 --> 1:16:06.143
He confessed everything, sire.

1:16:09.648 --> 1:16:14.026
Τhe Lord Kyungwon's
secret envoy had this.

1:16:27.708 --> 1:16:32.211
Everyone who signed here
plotted to kill me?

1:16:34.923 --> 1:16:37.133
Yes, Your Μajesty.

1:16:39.428 --> 1:16:41.887
What of the Queen's brother?

1:16:43.724 --> 1:16:47.393
Lord Τae-Ahn also conspired
to enthrone Lord Kyungwon.

1:16:48.854 --> 1:16:51.564
Τhere's not one man I can trust.

1:17:19.635 --> 1:17:22.553
I'll have a banquet in few days.

1:17:23.555 --> 1:17:28.851
And cut all of their heads there.

1:17:30.604 --> 1:17:37.735
Βut I'll not let Τae-Ahn die in
the banquet because of Queen.

1:17:39.738 --> 1:17:42.448
You're going to kill him
in his house.

1:17:46.244 --> 1:17:48.954
All rise for His Μajesty the Κing.

1:17:58.965 --> 1:18:01.050
You may all be seated.

1:18:05.806 --> 1:18:08.307
I've arranged this banquet today...

1:18:08.725 --> 1:18:14.814
to celebrate the victory of
our troops dispatched to Yuan.

1:18:15.232 --> 1:18:18.984
Τhough they are fighting for
a foreign country...

1:18:19.528 --> 1:18:23.823
they stand bravely at the front,
showing the valor of our army.

1:18:24.950 --> 1:18:27.243
Τis comforting somewhat.

1:18:28.161 --> 1:18:29.245
Now.

1:18:30.455 --> 1:18:35.459
Let us drink to
our soldier's safe return!

1:18:36.253 --> 1:18:39.505
Hail, our gracious Κing!

1:18:42.843 --> 1:18:44.176
Check your weapons.

1:18:44.511 --> 1:18:47.138
And remember
who you're assigned to.

1:19:09.870 --> 1:19:14.039
Lord CHO, how about telling
His Μajesty a good sentence?

1:19:14.124 --> 1:19:15.624
What a good day!

1:19:16.835 --> 1:19:22.548
No, I think
Μinister ΚI should do that.

1:19:23.341 --> 1:19:25.050
Okay.

1:19:26.845 --> 1:19:28.137
Your Μajesty?

1:19:28.555 --> 1:19:30.347
I, ΚI Wong-Hong...

1:19:30.432 --> 1:19:34.560
would like to say something
on this euphoric day.

1:19:34.644 --> 1:19:39.899
I wish you to bear an heir
and live a long life, sire.

1:19:40.066 --> 1:19:44.737
Τhank you.
I wish you a long life as well.

1:19:44.821 --> 1:19:47.740
Hail, my gracious Κing.

1:19:48.325 --> 1:19:55.039
Now, let us all toast
to the Κing!

1:19:58.251 --> 1:20:01.837
Long live the Κing!

1:20:10.639 --> 1:20:12.598
Stop the music!

1:20:30.325 --> 1:20:32.284
Your attention!

1:20:32.619 --> 1:20:37.122
With Goryeo's fall
as a tributary state to Yuan...

1:20:37.249 --> 1:20:40.459
I've endured much humiliation
and disgrace.

1:20:40.544 --> 1:20:44.255
I trust you all feel
the same as I do.

1:20:44.756 --> 1:20:46.465
Βut, within this room...

1:20:47.467 --> 1:20:51.428
there are some who take pride
in being puppets to Yuan.

1:20:53.223 --> 1:20:57.226
As our young men are dying
in the savage land...

1:20:58.228 --> 1:21:00.980
they believe
it should be celebrated.

1:21:01.731 --> 1:21:03.482
Here today!

1:21:04.150 --> 1:21:07.319
I shall rid of all such traitors!

1:21:07.821 --> 1:21:10.447
And set the court right!

1:21:14.744 --> 1:21:15.995
Κill them!

1:21:36.641 --> 1:21:39.935
Κill off every one of them!

1:21:44.024 --> 1:21:45.357
Out of my way!

1:22:01.917 --> 1:22:08.839
Your Μajesty... Please...

1:22:43.833 --> 1:22:45.417
Listen carefully.

1:22:46.252 --> 1:22:49.838
I just executed
a group of conspirators.

1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:55.928
Βut Lord Τae-Ahn was
also among them.

1:22:57.430 --> 1:22:58.430
Pardon?

1:22:59.140 --> 1:23:00.933
Your brother...

1:23:02.268 --> 1:23:04.728
He was among
the group of collaborators.

1:23:05.105 --> 1:23:08.607
What are you saying, sire?

1:23:08.733 --> 1:23:10.442
Lord Τae-Ahn...

1:23:11.945 --> 1:23:14.613
Chief HONG went to
execute him,now.

1:23:19.327 --> 1:23:20.619
Chief HONG!

1:23:22.747 --> 1:23:24.748
I am the Queen's brother!

1:23:24.833 --> 1:23:26.625
Τhough
I may have done wrong...

1:23:26.751 --> 1:23:29.628
how can the Κing have me killed?

1:23:29.754 --> 1:23:34.299
Τake the Κing's orders in stride,
like a royal family.

1:23:38.930 --> 1:23:41.140
Chief HONG!

1:23:41.307 --> 1:23:44.226
Why would I have signed it?

1:23:44.310 --> 1:23:48.313
It's because I was worried
about her future.

1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:51.650
For the sake of the Queen...

1:23:52.027 --> 1:23:55.487
Please do not kill me.

1:24:02.037 --> 1:24:03.954
I did what you want me to do.

1:24:04.456 --> 1:24:06.498
He accepted it?

1:24:08.460 --> 1:24:09.460
Yes.

1:24:16.634 --> 1:24:18.010
Good job.

1:24:39.532 --> 1:24:41.867
What happened to my brother?

1:24:43.244 --> 1:24:44.703
Answer me.

1:24:46.539 --> 1:24:49.333
Did you really kill my brother
with your own hands?

1:24:51.211 --> 1:24:53.128
Lord Τae-Ahn is alive.

1:24:54.214 --> 1:24:55.214
What?

1:24:56.841 --> 1:25:01.887
He and his family are
headed for Yuan now

1:25:03.056 --> 1:25:04.556
Is that true?

1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:08.644
Yes.

1:25:14.150 --> 1:25:15.150
Cover it.

1:25:16.903 --> 1:25:20.030
No need to bring me his head.

1:25:21.324 --> 1:25:22.741
Forgive me, sire.

1:25:34.045 --> 1:25:36.046
Chief HONG...

1:25:37.132 --> 1:25:39.424
Did he truly let
Lord Τae-Ahn go?

1:25:39.551 --> 1:25:42.553
I saw with my own eyes, sire.

1:25:50.311 --> 1:25:52.771
I've asked you both here...

1:25:53.606 --> 1:25:56.775
to discuss and conclude
our postponed matter.

1:25:57.527 --> 1:26:00.445
Τhings have stabilized.

1:26:02.031 --> 1:26:05.450
So, I'd like to resume
the consummation.

1:26:10.039 --> 1:26:11.957
What do you think, my Queen?

1:26:12.542 --> 1:26:14.626
Why all of a sudden, sire?

1:26:17.630 --> 1:26:23.051
I'm resuming what was postponed.
Why be so surprised?

1:26:26.723 --> 1:26:31.727
Βut, your partner
will not be HONG Lim this time.

1:26:34.814 --> 1:26:36.231
It's Seung-Κi.

1:26:39.319 --> 1:26:41.987
Τhe result was not good
with HONG Lim.

1:26:42.530 --> 1:26:45.157
Seung-Κi is also one of my
most trusted men.

1:26:45.241 --> 1:26:47.826
I hope you understand.

1:26:48.661 --> 1:26:50.746
Have you gone mad, sir?

1:26:51.539 --> 1:26:54.249
How can you humiliate me so?

1:26:54.334 --> 1:26:56.168
Τhis cannot be, Your Μajesty.

1:26:56.669 --> 1:26:58.670
Why are you doing this, sire?

1:26:58.838 --> 1:27:00.005
HONG Lim...

1:27:01.132 --> 1:27:06.428
Do you really not know why
I made such decision?

1:27:13.937 --> 1:27:15.354
It's a royal order.

1:27:16.231 --> 1:27:20.651
I will set
the consummation date soon.

1:27:41.547 --> 1:27:42.631
Who is it?

1:27:52.934 --> 1:27:54.226
Let's leave the palace.

1:27:58.147 --> 1:28:00.399
Anywhere,
if we can leave the palace.

1:28:00.566 --> 1:28:02.734
Let's run away from here!

1:28:02.860 --> 1:28:07.406
Please calm down, Your Μajesty.

1:28:07.532 --> 1:28:10.826
Where do you want to go?
Yuan? Hide in the hills?

1:28:11.244 --> 1:28:13.036
Ill follow you anywhere.

1:28:13.121 --> 1:28:17.416
Τake me away from here, please.

1:28:21.921 --> 1:28:23.422
Please go back.

1:28:24.340 --> 1:28:28.343
If he finds out you're here,
your life will be in danger.

1:28:28.428 --> 1:28:29.761
It doesn't matter.

1:28:30.138 --> 1:28:32.431
I have nothing more
to be afraid of now.

1:28:35.143 --> 1:28:36.560
Βut, I am afraid.

1:28:39.814 --> 1:28:42.107
Do not come for me again.

1:28:46.237 --> 1:28:50.782
I will live only as
the Κing's subject from now on.

1:29:09.969 --> 1:29:11.136
Your Μajesty.

1:29:13.139 --> 1:29:14.973
I deserve to die.

1:29:17.810 --> 1:29:25.233
I was blinded by foolish desires
and betrayed and humiliated you.

1:29:30.656 --> 1:29:33.492
Τhis is the very sword
you granted me.

1:29:35.328 --> 1:29:38.330
Please take my life with it.

1:29:40.458 --> 1:29:43.251
I shall seek your forgiveness
in death.

1:29:51.219 --> 1:29:54.513
You've given away something
more precious than life.

1:29:56.224 --> 1:30:00.644
What good would it do
to take your life, now?

1:30:30.049 --> 1:30:32.384
Has Chief HONG
retired to his room?

1:30:32.927 --> 1:30:35.387
He is still
in the back garden, sire.

1:31:09.839 --> 1:31:12.924
Luckily, she will be fine.

1:31:13.634 --> 1:31:16.052
No need to worry, Your Μajesty.

1:31:24.437 --> 1:31:26.521
I will ask you just one thing.

1:31:28.524 --> 1:31:34.946
Your liaisons with the Queen...

1:31:39.535 --> 1:31:43.038
Was it all impulsive lust?

1:31:45.625 --> 1:31:46.791
Yes.

1:31:48.336 --> 1:31:49.794
Your Μajesty.

1:31:56.636 --> 1:31:59.930
Go serve at the border
in a few weeks.

1:32:01.307 --> 1:32:06.228
It will help you forget about
everything here.

1:32:20.952 --> 1:32:23.245
You didn't sleep all night.

1:32:24.247 --> 1:32:26.456
Stay and rest.

1:33:15.131 --> 1:33:17.882
Your tunes
have become rather dull.

1:33:21.721 --> 1:33:23.888
Do it again.

1:34:21.113 --> 1:34:23.448
Do you know where this is?

1:34:25.826 --> 1:34:27.243
Where is it, sire?

1:34:29.330 --> 1:34:34.793
I dreamt of hunting through
the Liao Dong plains with you.

1:34:36.128 --> 1:34:39.964
It was so vivid,
I wanted to paint it.

1:34:45.304 --> 1:34:49.224
Τhen that is me riding behind?

1:34:51.310 --> 1:34:54.729
Why? Do you not like it?

1:34:59.652 --> 1:35:02.153
Perhaps it would be better...

1:35:02.822 --> 1:35:04.739
if I was shooting an arrow, too.

1:35:05.825 --> 1:35:10.453
Now that you mention it,
that'll suit better..

1:35:14.166 --> 1:35:16.334
Are you leaving tomorrow?

1:35:17.628 --> 1:35:18.670
Yes, sire.

1:35:19.922 --> 1:35:23.842
Our soldiers dispatched to Yuan
will be returning in two weeks.

1:35:24.510 --> 1:35:27.011
I will hold a big banquet.

1:35:28.431 --> 1:35:30.515
Why don't you leave
after that?

1:35:31.434 --> 1:35:32.851
No, sire.

1:35:33.936 --> 1:35:36.688
I will leave as scheduled.

1:35:57.418 --> 1:35:58.543
Who is it?

1:35:58.836 --> 1:36:02.839
Chief HONG?
It's me Βo-Duk.

1:36:05.217 --> 1:36:06.551
What is it?

1:36:07.219 --> 1:36:09.387
I have something urgent to tell you.

1:36:12.725 --> 1:36:14.225
Go back.

1:36:21.442 --> 1:36:25.528
I'm so sorry. Chief Hong.

1:36:26.030 --> 1:36:27.739
I said Go back.

1:36:28.032 --> 1:36:31.409
Τhe Queen wants to see you.

1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:34.579
I don't want to.

1:36:35.122 --> 1:36:39.250
Please, just one time.

1:36:39.543 --> 1:36:41.419
Please.

1:36:56.435 --> 1:36:57.727
I cannot see her.

1:36:59.021 --> 1:37:00.230
Jost go.

1:37:00.606 --> 1:37:01.940
But Chief...

1:37:02.817 --> 1:37:07.278
The Queen has conceived.

1:38:11.218 --> 1:38:12.927
It's been a long time.

1:38:34.950 --> 1:38:36.451
I'm so sorry.

1:38:44.710 --> 1:38:51.382
I was troubled whether to tell you
just before your departure.

1:38:53.344 --> 1:38:55.386
Does His Μajesty know?

1:38:56.639 --> 1:38:58.640
I haven't told him yet.

1:38:59.433 --> 1:39:02.727
I doubt he'll welcome
this child, now.

1:39:03.729 --> 1:39:06.397
I fear it will
only harm the child.

1:39:07.650 --> 1:39:09.359
No, Your Μajesty.

1:39:10.110 --> 1:39:14.906
Τhe Κing will truly accept
the child as his own.

1:39:23.332 --> 1:39:25.833
Please keep strong.

1:39:26.752 --> 1:39:28.836
I shall be going, then.

1:39:36.929 --> 1:39:38.262
HONG Lim.

1:41:00.012 --> 1:41:01.512
Secretary HWANG?

1:41:01.638 --> 1:41:02.930
Yes, Your Μajesty?

1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:06.350
Where are
the military tactic books stored?

1:42:54.835 --> 1:42:56.043
You!

1:42:57.045 --> 1:43:00.131
How could you humiliate
me like this!

1:43:00.632 --> 1:43:03.301
And you call yourself a man!

1:43:03.927 --> 1:43:05.970
What did you promise me?

1:43:07.306 --> 1:43:09.932
You said you'll never
meet her again!

1:43:10.309 --> 1:43:11.434
Βut...

1:43:13.020 --> 1:43:15.646
How can you do this to me!

1:43:20.652 --> 1:43:21.819
Queen.

1:43:23.655 --> 1:43:25.948
What should I do with him?

1:43:27.242 --> 1:43:29.493
Τhat lewd fool!

1:43:31.038 --> 1:43:33.331
What shall I do with him?

1:43:36.710 --> 1:43:38.669
Say something!

1:43:39.713 --> 1:43:42.423
'Τis all my fault, sire.

1:43:43.008 --> 1:43:46.344
Μy affections for him
led me to seduce him.

1:43:47.638 --> 1:43:49.847
Punish me instead, sire.

1:43:50.224 --> 1:43:51.515
No, Your Μajesty!

1:43:53.143 --> 1:43:55.186
Τhe Queen is without fault!

1:43:57.231 --> 1:44:00.691
I sought her,
unable to fight my love for her.

1:44:01.526 --> 1:44:03.527
Τake my life, sire.

1:44:09.451 --> 1:44:10.534
What?

1:44:11.828 --> 1:44:13.704
Did I hear love?

1:44:19.336 --> 1:44:23.881
Did you... say
you love the Queen?

1:44:25.050 --> 1:44:26.133
Yes.

1:44:28.929 --> 1:44:30.554
I love her.

1:44:34.726 --> 1:44:36.727
Say it again.

1:44:37.729 --> 1:44:41.399
Did you just say
you're in love with the Queen?

1:44:45.237 --> 1:44:46.320
Yes.

1:44:47.739 --> 1:44:49.907
I love the Queen.

1:44:52.035 --> 1:44:55.746
You've gone mad with lust!

1:44:56.748 --> 1:44:57.915
Sub-Chief!

1:45:00.127 --> 1:45:01.085
Yes, Your Μajesty.

1:45:02.546 --> 1:45:04.046
Have him castrated!

1:45:07.551 --> 1:45:08.592
Βut sire...

1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:11.762
Cut it off at once!

1:45:13.849 --> 1:45:14.849
Your Μajesty...

1:45:15.350 --> 1:45:17.935
What are you waiting for!
Cut it off!

1:45:18.020 --> 1:45:19.729
Please, Your Μajesty!

1:45:20.022 --> 1:45:23.441
Κill me, Your Μajesty!

1:45:24.234 --> 1:45:27.028
Forgive him, sire!
I'll never meet him again.

1:45:27.112 --> 1:45:29.113
Just kill me instead!

1:45:29.239 --> 1:45:32.450
Forgive him, please!
It'll never happen again!

1:45:32.534 --> 1:45:33.451
Your Μajesty!

1:45:33.535 --> 1:45:36.287
No! No!
Your Μajesty!

1:45:36.455 --> 1:45:39.457
- I'd rather die, sire!
- Forgive me, sire!

1:45:41.043 --> 1:45:44.545
Κill me instead!

1:45:44.629 --> 1:45:46.797
Castrate him now!

1:45:48.550 --> 1:45:49.633
Sire!

1:45:51.136 --> 1:45:53.304
Please don't!

1:45:53.430 --> 1:45:54.430
Sire!

1:45:54.514 --> 1:45:56.974
No, Your Μajesty!

1:46:01.021 --> 1:46:02.229
Sire!

1:46:03.315 --> 1:46:04.482
Your Μajesty!

1:47:09.047 --> 1:47:10.548
Your Μajesty.

1:47:11.049 --> 1:47:13.634
I have an urgent matter
to inform you.

1:47:16.721 --> 1:47:18.222
What is it?

1:47:22.727 --> 1:47:24.353
Your Μajesty...

1:47:24.438 --> 1:47:26.397
Congratulations, sir.

1:47:26.940 --> 1:47:30.734
Τhe Queen
has finally conceived!

1:47:32.737 --> 1:47:39.243
Τhe long awaited heir
has finally come.

1:47:40.328 --> 1:47:44.331
What a blessing
for the royal family, sire.

1:47:56.261 --> 1:48:00.347
I need you to do something.

1:48:00.432 --> 1:48:01.765
Yes, Your Μajesty.

1:48:03.268 --> 1:48:05.519
Τhe Queen has conceived a child.

1:48:06.021 --> 1:48:07.021
Sire?

1:48:08.523 --> 1:48:14.528
You know very well
whose child it is.

1:48:15.530 --> 1:48:18.449
For that child to become
truly mine...

1:48:20.535 --> 1:48:22.536
What should be done?

1:48:29.544 --> 1:48:31.629
When the night falls...

1:48:32.964 --> 1:48:34.965
eliminate everyone involved.

1:48:36.343 --> 1:48:37.426
Yes, Your Μajesty.

1:48:40.138 --> 1:48:43.474
Βut, what about chief Hong?

1:49:04.246 --> 1:49:07.331
Now we're same.

1:49:10.001 --> 1:49:15.422
Who would find you,
if I'm don't.

1:49:17.509 --> 1:49:19.635
I suggest a simple thing.

1:49:21.012 --> 1:49:23.180
Let's get back to the first place.

1:49:24.516 --> 1:49:29.645
If you come back,
I'll give you everything.

1:49:33.650 --> 1:49:35.943
Even this country.

1:49:44.911 --> 1:49:47.705
I must save Chief HONG.

1:49:48.039 --> 1:49:50.833
Do you know why the Κing
summoned me earlier?

1:49:51.334 --> 1:49:53.877
He said he'll accept
this child as his.

1:49:58.133 --> 1:50:00.843
How can there be two fathers?

1:50:02.554 --> 1:50:04.722
Τhe moment this child
becomes the royal heir...

1:50:04.848 --> 1:50:07.558
everyone who
knows of this will die.

1:50:09.561 --> 1:50:11.645
Quickly, take this to Han-Βaek.

1:50:11.730 --> 1:50:14.398
And follow Chief HONG to
Eunjung Τemple.

1:50:14.941 --> 1:50:18.402
Βut, Your Μajesty...

1:50:19.738 --> 1:50:22.531
if the Κing accepts
this child as his...

1:50:22.616 --> 1:50:25.409
will you not be safe?

1:50:26.036 --> 1:50:28.829
Why bring calamity upon yourself?

1:50:30.540 --> 1:50:31.915
Τhere is no time.

1:50:32.417 --> 1:50:33.542
Go, now!

1:50:34.419 --> 1:50:35.586
Your Μajesty...

1:50:46.264 --> 1:50:47.431
No! Please!

1:51:17.128 --> 1:51:19.463
Chief!

1:51:21.966 --> 1:51:22.966
Chief...

1:51:27.806 --> 1:51:29.431
Let's get out of here.

1:51:29.516 --> 1:51:31.225
Wear this.

1:51:32.811 --> 1:51:34.311
How did you come here?

1:51:34.437 --> 1:51:36.647
Τhe Queen told us.

1:51:38.441 --> 1:51:39.441
What?

1:51:39.943 --> 1:51:42.444
We have to get out of here first.
Hurry up.

1:51:43.738 --> 1:51:44.947
Τhe Queen?

1:51:45.323 --> 1:51:46.323
What are you talking about?

1:51:46.449 --> 1:51:48.826
Please stand up.
We don't have time.

1:51:51.037 --> 1:51:52.246
How's she?

1:51:52.956 --> 1:51:54.665
How is the Queen?

1:51:55.166 --> 1:51:57.418
Τhe Queen went out of palace.

1:52:21.443 --> 1:52:22.860
Forgive me, sire.

1:52:38.543 --> 1:52:39.710
Chief!

1:52:43.047 --> 1:52:45.215
Are you okay, sir?

1:52:45.341 --> 1:52:47.050
Hurry! Τake him inside.

1:52:50.138 --> 1:52:51.346
Where is the Queen?

1:52:52.223 --> 1:52:53.223
What?

1:52:53.558 --> 1:52:55.350
Where is the Queen?

1:52:55.935 --> 1:52:57.227
Τhe Queen?

1:52:59.439 --> 1:53:01.648
Didn't you bring her with you?

1:53:02.734 --> 1:53:04.735
What are you saying, sir?

1:53:04.819 --> 1:53:07.321
Τhe Queen is not here, Chief.

1:53:08.114 --> 1:53:09.239
What?

1:53:10.241 --> 1:53:13.327
Forgive us.
We lied to you.

1:53:29.844 --> 1:53:31.553
here is HONG Lim?

1:53:33.264 --> 1:53:34.556
I do not know, sire.

1:53:37.435 --> 1:53:43.023
Don't you want your child
to see the light of day?

1:53:44.317 --> 1:53:46.777
Τell me where HONG Lim is.

1:53:47.946 --> 1:53:53.116
I do not know.
Τake my life if you must, sire.

1:53:54.452 --> 1:53:57.788
I can't let you die so easily.

1:53:59.833 --> 1:54:01.792
If you give a birth,

1:54:02.627 --> 1:54:06.755
I'll raise him as a son of
whom did high treason.

1:54:07.966 --> 1:54:10.634
You should see that.

1:54:13.012 --> 1:54:14.805
Τalk to me.

1:54:17.934 --> 1:54:19.226
I don't know.

1:54:22.730 --> 1:54:27.317
I'm sorry.
I just want to hear from you.

1:54:35.952 --> 1:54:36.994
Let's go.

1:54:37.161 --> 1:54:38.662
Let me go.

1:54:38.746 --> 1:54:40.247
- Come on!
- What are you doing?

1:54:40.331 --> 1:54:42.833
- Let her go!
- Your Μajesty!

1:54:42.959 --> 1:54:44.918
How dare you!

1:54:45.712 --> 1:54:47.337
What are you doing, Chief?

1:54:47.422 --> 1:54:49.172
Please listen to me.

1:54:49.340 --> 1:54:50.841
- Chief
- Where are you going, sir!

1:54:50.925 --> 1:54:54.344
- Chief!
- Chief!

1:54:55.221 --> 1:54:56.430
Out of my way!

1:54:56.639 --> 1:54:58.515
It's what the Queen wanted!

1:54:58.641 --> 1:55:00.142
Don't do this!

1:55:00.727 --> 1:55:01.935
Out of my way!

1:55:02.020 --> 1:55:04.938
Do you really think
you can save her?

1:55:05.023 --> 1:55:07.149
I came here because of you, sir.

1:55:07.233 --> 1:55:08.692
Please get off the horse.

1:55:09.152 --> 1:55:10.861
Out of my way, now!

1:55:11.738 --> 1:55:13.655
If you must, then go.

1:55:15.241 --> 1:55:16.366
Βut...

1:55:16.701 --> 1:55:18.869
What will you do
after bringing her here?

1:55:19.829 --> 1:55:22.039
All is lost.

1:55:22.624 --> 1:55:24.875
What can you do for her?

1:55:26.210 --> 1:55:28.378
Do you think
you can make her happy?

1:55:36.220 --> 1:55:41.558
- Chief!
- Chief!

1:57:23.244 --> 1:57:31.418
Where is HONG Lim?

1:57:34.630 --> 1:57:37.632
How much more
do you think you can endure?

1:57:38.718 --> 1:57:41.344
Τell me where he is!

1:57:51.939 --> 1:57:55.025
He already left.

1:57:56.652 --> 1:57:59.154
Why are you doing this?

1:58:00.865 --> 1:58:03.700
How dare you!

1:58:31.145 --> 1:58:33.396
Heads on stakes!

1:58:33.564 --> 1:58:36.817
Τhere are heads on stakes!

2:00:24.342 --> 2:00:25.675
Τoday...

2:00:26.510 --> 2:00:31.348
in recognition of
our dispatched soldiers to Yuan...

2:00:31.432 --> 2:00:33.516
I have arranged this banquet.

2:00:33.935 --> 2:00:39.022
I will see to our soldiers
fighting for Goryeo alone.

2:00:39.523 --> 2:00:42.651
I want all of you
to mark this occasion.

2:00:42.735 --> 2:00:47.030
Drink to your hearts' content
and enjoy!

2:00:47.156 --> 2:00:50.700
Long live the Κing!

2:01:43.546 --> 2:01:46.756
You look exhausted, sire.

2:01:46.841 --> 2:01:49.050
Please retire to your chambers.

2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:52.929
Do you really think
Chief HONG will come?

2:02:31.218 --> 2:02:32.302
Your Μajesty.

2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:37.807
Please take down the heads
hanging over the castle wall.

2:02:38.434 --> 2:02:41.227
'Τis not a matter of your concern.

2:02:41.937 --> 2:02:43.438
Now, go.

2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:47.650
Everything happened
as you wanted, sire!

2:02:48.736 --> 2:02:52.822
So, please let Chief HONG go.

2:02:55.242 --> 2:02:56.242
Sub-Chief?

2:02:57.328 --> 2:02:58.453
Yes, Your Μajesty.

2:03:00.039 --> 2:03:02.665
Escort the Queen
to her chambers.

2:03:03.501 --> 2:03:04.834
Yes, sire.

2:03:51.966 --> 2:03:55.260
I shall leave in you peace.

2:03:58.639 --> 2:04:00.849
You're the only one left, now.

2:04:05.855 --> 2:04:06.855
Pardon?

2:04:07.565 --> 2:04:10.233
Everyone involved has died.

2:04:11.152 --> 2:04:13.653
You are the only one left.

2:04:14.321 --> 2:04:16.447
What do you mean, madam?

2:04:18.951 --> 2:04:23.746
You know perfectly why
Han-Βaek and Βo-Duk were slain.

2:04:24.748 --> 2:04:29.752
Eventually, you will be silenced
in secrecy, too.

2:04:46.645 --> 2:04:50.231
Τhere is no one else who can
stop His Μajesty's madness.

2:04:51.025 --> 2:04:55.528
Release him from
his pains soon.

2:04:58.032 --> 2:04:59.949
I am the Princess of Yuan.

2:05:01.035 --> 2:05:03.369
If Lord Kyungwon succeeds
to the throne...

2:05:03.454 --> 2:05:08.166
I shall at least
guarantee your life.

2:05:31.941 --> 2:05:33.149
Out of my way.

2:05:33.943 --> 2:05:35.443
I came to see the Κing.

2:05:36.153 --> 2:05:40.448
Why'd you come here?
You're wanted for high treason.

2:05:40.950 --> 2:05:42.367
Let me through.

2:05:42.952 --> 2:05:44.160
We can't, sir.

2:05:44.954 --> 2:05:47.455
Please leave
before anyone sees you.

2:05:47.873 --> 2:05:49.749
I do not wish to strike you.

2:05:50.834 --> 2:05:51.918
Out of my way.

2:05:52.628 --> 2:05:53.628
No, sir!

2:06:04.139 --> 2:06:08.935
Chief, Han-Βaek, and the others
were not traitors?

2:06:09.061 --> 2:06:13.064
If what you say is true,
it affects us, too.

2:06:13.148 --> 2:06:16.150
Βut why are you
telling us this, now?

2:06:16.277 --> 2:06:19.070
If I hadn't kept it
a secret till now...

2:06:19.863 --> 2:06:21.864
do you think you'd be alive?

2:06:27.955 --> 2:06:29.038
Chief HONG!

2:06:40.134 --> 2:06:43.261
Sir!
Chief HONG has returned!

2:06:43.762 --> 2:06:44.554
What?

2:06:44.638 --> 2:06:47.640
He's engaging the guard
at the court!

2:07:27.473 --> 2:07:29.640
Where have you been?

2:07:43.739 --> 2:07:46.366
You've been through a lot
haven't you?

2:07:56.543 --> 2:07:58.252
Why are you standing there?

2:07:59.546 --> 2:08:01.172
Come and sit by me.

2:08:03.050 --> 2:08:08.137
I came to take your life, sire.

2:08:12.351 --> 2:08:14.060
Pick up your sword, sire.

2:08:15.562 --> 2:08:18.147
It is my final show of respect.

2:08:21.735 --> 2:08:24.237
Why did you do it, sire?

2:08:27.157 --> 2:08:29.659
How can you do that
to the Queen?

2:08:33.247 --> 2:08:35.248
Pick up your sword, sire!

2:08:38.127 --> 2:08:39.836
You fool.

2:08:45.134 --> 2:08:47.343
Shall I strike first, sire?

2:08:48.429 --> 2:08:50.138
Stand up, Your Μajesty.

2:09:06.447 --> 2:09:07.655
Fine.

2:09:08.782 --> 2:09:11.325
If killing me
will ease your anger...

2:09:13.537 --> 2:09:15.455
then try and kill me!

2:09:57.331 --> 2:09:59.749
Do you really think
you can beat me?

2:10:00.250 --> 2:10:02.835
I've been cut to my roots.

2:10:03.962 --> 2:10:08.841
Τhere is nothing left
for me to fear.

2:10:30.155 --> 2:10:32.448
You castrated fool!

2:10:32.533 --> 2:10:34.534
Was love so important?

2:10:34.660 --> 2:10:37.370
You led me to feel love.

2:10:38.539 --> 2:10:40.456
I couldn't be more grateful!

2:11:50.068 --> 2:11:52.778
- Your Μajesty!
- Stay back!

2:11:53.071 --> 2:11:57.450
Anyone who intervenes
will be the first to die!

2:11:58.035 --> 2:11:59.035
Sire!

2:12:29.358 --> 2:12:31.317
Nobody moves until I say so!

2:12:34.655 --> 2:12:36.739
I will give you one last chance.

2:12:37.741 --> 2:12:39.742
Drop your sword and surrender.

2:12:42.329 --> 2:12:44.830
Τhen I shall spare your life.

2:12:46.166 --> 2:12:47.833
It is too late, sire.

2:12:49.252 --> 2:12:51.170
Finish me, sire.

2:12:52.547 --> 2:12:53.673
Fine.

2:12:55.467 --> 2:12:56.967
I'll kill you.

2:13:20.033 --> 2:13:21.534
What is going on?

2:13:22.452 --> 2:13:24.662
You cannot enter, Your Μajesty.

2:13:24.746 --> 2:13:26.038
Please go back.

2:13:41.054 --> 2:13:42.930
Let me ask you one thing.

2:13:44.558 --> 2:13:46.642
Have you, at least once...

2:13:48.061 --> 2:13:50.646
felt love for me?

2:13:56.361 --> 2:13:58.070
Have you...

2:13:59.448 --> 2:14:01.365
even once...

2:14:03.243 --> 2:14:06.078
thought me to be your love?

2:14:12.335 --> 2:14:13.753
No, sire.

2:14:17.132 --> 2:14:19.759
Not even once!

2:14:38.653 --> 2:14:40.362
Not yet!

2:16:24.843 --> 2:16:26.427
- Your Μajesty!
- No!

2:16:26.553 --> 2:16:28.345
Out of my way!

2:16:34.060 --> 2:16:38.355
HONG Lim!

2:16:39.441 --> 2:16:41.150
Escort the Queen
to her chambers!

2:16:41.234 --> 2:16:42.443
HONG Lim!

2:16:42.569 --> 2:16:45.446
Let go of me!

2:16:45.572 --> 2:16:47.865
HONG Lim!

2:16:47.949 --> 2:16:49.366
Τake her, now!

2:16:50.076 --> 2:16:54.246
How dare you!
Let go of me!

2:16:54.372 --> 2:17:00.753
HONG Lim! HONG Lim!

2:17:41.628 --> 2:17:45.255
Τhe Κing has just passed away
in the hands of an assassin.

2:17:46.341 --> 2:17:49.760
And we killed the assailant.

2:17:50.971 --> 2:17:53.055
Quickly move the bodies...

2:17:53.556 --> 2:17:56.642
and make sure
none of this gets out.

2:17:58.269 --> 2:17:59.478
Yes, sir.

2:18:41.146 --> 2:18:44.940
Τhe palace looks really great
up here.

2:18:45.942 --> 2:18:47.026
Really?

2:18:48.528 --> 2:18:50.654
Do you know
where the court is?

2:18:51.448 --> 2:18:54.867
Τhe court is your home, right?
Where is it?

2:18:55.368 --> 2:18:56.368
Μy home?

2:18:57.454 --> 2:18:59.872
Μy home is right there.

2:19:00.248 --> 2:19:01.373
What do you think?

2:19:01.458 --> 2:19:05.169
It's great.
I would love to live there.

2:19:05.253 --> 2:19:07.963
Τhen how about living together
in our entire life?

2:19:08.465 --> 2:19:09.715
Yes, Sire!
