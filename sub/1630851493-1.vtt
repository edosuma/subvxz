00:59.110 --> 01:01.145
Have a good one.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.980
Have a good one.

01:03.114 --> 01:04.513
It'd be great to
know when you're coming next time.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.084
There's a schedule
at every station,

01:06.216 --> 01:07.284
same times every day.

01:07.417 --> 01:08.318
You don't exactly
follow it.

01:08.452 --> 01:10.154
I don't control traffic.

01:10.287 --> 01:13.191
Prick.

01:13.323 --> 01:16.293
Have a good one.

01:16.426 --> 01:18.663
Afternoon.

02:55.793 --> 02:57.527
No, no, no, no...
if I want a nice meal,

02:57.662 --> 02:59.063
I'll go
to someplace nice,

02:59.197 --> 03:01.699
but if I want fast food,
I'll go to McDonald's, sure,

03:01.833 --> 03:03.801
but I'm not gonna to go
to one of the dine-in only ones.

03:03.935 --> 03:05.269
McDonald's is
fucking McDonald's, man.

03:05.402 --> 03:06.804
What's the difference?

03:06.938 --> 03:07.939
Right,
and McDonald's is supposed to be

03:08.072 --> 03:09.372
cheap, fast, and scummy.

03:09.506 --> 03:10.808
They... They give me a full meal
in two minutes

03:10.942 --> 03:13.144
'cause it's all gross,
pre-cooked garbage.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.713
And if I want that,
great.

03:15.847 --> 03:18.683
But if you have to go inside,
the cashiers, the managers...

03:18.816 --> 03:20.584
they all start thinking
they work at a real restaurant

03:20.718 --> 03:23.020
instead of the french-fry
shoveling industry.

03:23.154 --> 03:24.889

03:59.657 --> 04:02.525

04:13.371 --> 04:15.139
Fuck that shit, bitch!

04:15.273 --> 04:18.009
Bitch is gonna die.

04:19.076 --> 04:21.611
Bitch!

04:21.745 --> 04:23.948
Die!
Fuck! Fuck!

04:24.081 --> 04:25.415
Fucking bitch.

04:25.548 --> 04:28.786

Yeah,
that is scary.

05:47.231 --> 05:49.467
I'll tell ya,
I am tired of this BS

05:49.599 --> 05:51.035
they got going on
down here.

05:51.168 --> 05:53.170
One day, you up and
you're making a lot of money,

05:53.304 --> 05:54.739
and then the boss comes in
and says,

05:54.872 --> 05:56.440
"Hey, I'm snatching
that route from you."

05:56.573 --> 05:57.808
What do you,
you know?

05:57.942 --> 05:59.010
Hey, don't complain
about the routes.

05:59.143 --> 06:00.411
Yeah,
you guys are lucky.

06:00.543 --> 06:01.979
I'm stuck here
for another, what?

06:02.113 --> 06:04.281
10, 20 years picking up crazy
passengers for shitty money?

06:05.783 --> 06:07.018
I'll tell you what,
let me tell you this.

06:07.151 --> 06:08.753
I had a homeless guy
get on the other day,

06:08.886 --> 06:10.454
and he was just
talking out of his head.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.857
He was just, like,
way out there.

06:12.990 --> 06:16.027
He also said...
uh, God, um...

06:16.160 --> 06:18.628
Yeah, that actually happened
to me the other day...

06:18.763 --> 06:19.864
Wait a minute,
I just remembered.

06:19.997 --> 06:21.365
He said
it was night terrors.

06:21.499 --> 06:22.933
Night terrors?
He's talking about he was...

06:23.067 --> 06:24.702
he was tossing
and turning in the bed,

06:24.835 --> 06:26.670
talking about night te-terrors
and the Boogeyman.

06:26.804 --> 06:27.938
I said,
"I got your Boogeyman.

06:28.072 --> 06:30.374
Boogie your butt
off of my bus."

06:30.508 --> 06:32.309
Too many zombie movies.

06:32.443 --> 06:34.111
Yeah, like they're all gonna
come and eat our brains.

06:34.245 --> 06:36.147
Stop!

06:36.280 --> 06:38.516
It's worth it, though.
You know what? It's worth it.

08:13.844 --> 08:17.181
Afternoon.

08:17.314 --> 08:19.383
Afternoon.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.155
Strange.

08:25.723 --> 08:28.159
What's strange?

08:31.495 --> 08:35.099
Y-Your bracelet...
it's, uh, it's interesting.

08:35.232 --> 08:37.967
It's different than
the other ones.

08:42.539 --> 08:45.176
Thanks.

08:45.309 --> 08:48.379
It was
my grandmother's.

08:48.512 --> 08:49.713
That's a cool gift.

08:49.847 --> 08:51.048
I wish.

08:51.182 --> 08:53.017
She wasn't really
into gift giving.

08:53.150 --> 08:55.052
I took it
when she died.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.888
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry.

08:58.022 --> 09:00.224
Don't be.
Grandmothers die.

09:00.357 --> 09:01.525
Everybody dies.

09:01.660 --> 09:03.761
They stink.
I don't like it here.

09:03.894 --> 09:05.896
Like it here...
I wish I were back up north,

09:06.030 --> 09:08.399
where people are friendly
to each other.

09:08.532 --> 09:09.733
I like your accent.

09:09.867 --> 09:11.936
Thanks.
I like yours.

09:12.069 --> 09:14.471
...like some kind of weirdo.

09:14.605 --> 09:17.341
This is... This the worst
fucking bus service

09:17.474 --> 09:19.777
I have ever driven on.

09:19.910 --> 09:21.579
I hate this place.

09:21.712 --> 09:23.480
And I hate all of you.

09:23.614 --> 09:26.183
You.
You ever bathe?

09:26.317 --> 09:27.284
Asshole.

09:27.418 --> 09:29.720
Sir, um, can you
quiet down please?

09:29.853 --> 09:33.290
I can't stand
being on this bus.

09:33.424 --> 09:35.125
Jerk.

09:35.259 --> 09:36.293
Tell you.

09:36.427 --> 09:37.995
Hey, you're disturbing
the other passengers.

09:38.128 --> 09:39.563
Shut the fuck up.

09:39.698 --> 09:42.566
Sir, please calm down and be quiet...
Or what?

09:42.701 --> 09:45.202
...or I'm going to have to
ask you to step off the bus.

09:45.336 --> 09:47.672
Fuck you,
bus driver.

09:47.805 --> 09:49.173
I'm the customer here.

09:49.306 --> 09:52.776
You get paid
with the money <i>I</i> pay in taxes.

09:52.910 --> 09:54.445
Fuck off.

09:54.578 --> 09:56.347
Shut up, man!

09:56.480 --> 09:58.949
What is your problem,
asshole?

09:59.083 --> 10:00.685
I'm just trying to go
for a ride.

10:00.818 --> 10:03.520
I'm trying
to get to work.

10:05.389 --> 10:08.192
Sometimes, I wish
I could punch these people.

10:08.325 --> 10:10.761
Why don't you?

10:21.105 --> 10:22.741
Sir,
please step off the bus.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.875
Oh,
fucking make me.

10:25.009 --> 10:26.877
Sir, I will call
the authorities, so please...

10:27.011 --> 10:28.312
I got all fucking day.
Sir.

10:28.445 --> 10:30.180
I don't want to make
these people wait for you,

10:30.314 --> 10:31.615
so just please step off the bus, sir.
Fucking asshole!

10:31.750 --> 10:32.850
Fuck you all.
What's your problem?

10:32.983 --> 10:34.251
You're my fucking problem.

10:34.385 --> 10:35.853
Alright, you know what sir?
Yeah?!

10:35.986 --> 10:36.887
I am calling the authorities
on you now, alright?

10:37.021 --> 10:37.888
I warned you once, but...

10:41.959 --> 10:43.927
Hey, I just wanted
to have a nice, relax...

10:45.629 --> 10:48.299
I said
get out of the seat.

10:48.432 --> 10:51.869
Exit the bus.
Get off of me, asshole.

11:21.432 --> 11:23.702
Is that S.O.P?

11:23.834 --> 11:26.136
I've never
done that before.

11:26.270 --> 11:29.073
Well, that was awesome.

11:29.206 --> 11:31.275
<i>Stop requested.</i>

11:37.581 --> 11:39.818
This is me.

11:39.950 --> 11:42.886
Hey!

11:43.020 --> 11:44.288
What's your name?

11:44.421 --> 11:46.758
Ashe.

11:46.890 --> 11:49.293
Hey, Ashe, do you maybe, uh...
do you... do you maybe

11:49.426 --> 11:51.128
sometimes,
you wanna hang out with me

11:51.261 --> 11:53.397
or, we, you know,
get together sometime togeth...

11:53.530 --> 11:54.565
together?

11:56.200 --> 11:58.535
I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm having a weird day.

11:58.670 --> 12:00.904
Sor... I apologize, I'm... Sure.

12:01.038 --> 12:04.408
Um...
How's Thursday?

12:04.541 --> 12:05.576
Yeah?

12:05.710 --> 12:07.177
Yeah, that's great.
Thursday's great.

12:07.311 --> 12:09.079
I mean, yeah.
Sure, cool, that'll work.

12:09.213 --> 12:12.316
Alright, well...
Let me give you my number.

12:12.449 --> 12:14.918
Right.

12:26.497 --> 12:28.232
Okay, cool.
Yeah, Thursday. Yeah.

12:28.365 --> 12:31.235
I got some stuff to move around,
but it'll... it'll work out.

12:31.368 --> 12:33.604
Alright, I look forward
to it, Will.

13:07.806 --> 13:09.674
Are you okay?

13:12.777 --> 13:14.144
Uh...

13:14.278 --> 13:15.880
Yeah, sorry.
I was...

13:16.013 --> 13:17.648
I was just
remembering something.

13:17.782 --> 13:20.083
Um...
What was I saying?

13:20.217 --> 13:21.985
Oh, uh...

13:22.119 --> 13:23.554
I don't know.

13:23.688 --> 13:25.690
I wasn't listening.

13:25.824 --> 13:27.458
Oh.
Just kidding.

13:27.591 --> 13:30.461
You were talking about
a Chinese guy.

13:31.763 --> 13:33.932
Right, this... so this
Chinese philosopher,

13:34.064 --> 13:36.300
um, he proposed
that one couldn't know

13:36.433 --> 13:40.437
if a fish was happy or not
unless one was a fish.

13:42.740 --> 13:44.041
Okay.

13:44.174 --> 13:45.442
Well, you know,

13:45.576 --> 13:48.078
I don't think these fish
are happy, to be honest.

13:48.212 --> 13:49.914
Yes, that's...
that's a correct statement,

13:50.047 --> 13:52.049
but also, um...

13:52.182 --> 13:55.185
how would you know
unless you were a fish?

13:55.319 --> 13:57.722
I guess I don't.
Right.

13:57.856 --> 14:00.123
Well, in all seriousness,
I think he's right.

14:00.257 --> 14:01.525
You know,
the lack of objectivity,

14:01.659 --> 14:03.661
the lack
of perspective...

14:03.795 --> 14:06.530
it's kind of what causes war
and genocide.

14:07.866 --> 14:09.667
I think about that
a lot.

14:11.168 --> 14:12.503
Uh, damn, that's...

14:12.636 --> 14:14.338
And then I go on Facebook
because fuck it,

14:14.471 --> 14:17.675
I mean,
who cares?

14:21.545 --> 14:24.682
You know, I-I feel like
we have a lot in common.

14:24.816 --> 14:28.853
Other than being
two miserable, lonely,

14:28.987 --> 14:30.554
disappointing mammals?

14:30.688 --> 14:33.590
Shackled by mediocrity
and afraid to die.

14:35.359 --> 14:38.629
Yeah.
I guess we do.

14:38.763 --> 14:41.699
Wow, you...
you think I'm mediocre?

14:43.768 --> 14:46.103
Isn't everybody?

14:46.236 --> 14:49.072
You're not.

14:49.206 --> 14:52.209
I disagree.

14:59.017 --> 15:03.955
Hey, I-I wanted to say thank you
for, um, having my back

15:04.087 --> 15:06.356
the other day
on the bus.

15:06.490 --> 15:07.457
Yeah.

15:07.591 --> 15:08.826
No problem.

15:08.960 --> 15:13.263
You know, I don't think I hit
somebody since I was a kid.

15:13.397 --> 15:14.631
Yeah?

15:14.766 --> 15:16.600
Were you picked on?

15:16.734 --> 15:20.270
I guess I was like a tend
to strike first kind of person.

15:20.404 --> 15:23.540
Yeah, I was, uh,
I was aggressive as a kid.

15:23.675 --> 15:27.210
Too many
violent video games?

15:27.344 --> 15:29.513
Yeah, or...
or maybe not enough.

15:39.057 --> 15:43.061
I mean, what else do you do
besides being on Facebook

15:43.193 --> 15:45.095
and, uh,
pondering war?

15:45.228 --> 15:46.430
Uh...

15:46.563 --> 15:48.298
I write poetry
and I draw.

15:48.432 --> 15:51.635
Oh, cool. Uh, poems.
Th-That's cool.

15:51.769 --> 15:53.370
Thanks.

15:53.503 --> 15:55.339
Do... Like for like a magazine
or something?

15:55.472 --> 15:57.775
Oh, no. I mean,
I do... I don't do it for work.

15:57.909 --> 15:59.109
Oh.

15:59.242 --> 16:02.080
I mean,
I-I-I write stuff.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.348
Um... but...

16:04.481 --> 16:06.450
Y'know, I don't think
people are their jobs.

16:06.583 --> 16:11.756
People are a multitude
of complex actions and ideas.

16:12.456 --> 16:15.492
I write poetry,
but it's not how I make money.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.095
I-I think
it's more relevant

16:17.227 --> 16:19.063
to who I am and what I do,
you know?

16:19.196 --> 16:20.430
Yeah.

16:20.564 --> 16:24.201
I-I've always wanted
to play an instrument.

16:24.334 --> 16:26.269
It's just, you know,
I never have enough time.

16:26.403 --> 16:27.805
Don't say that.

16:27.939 --> 16:31.375
You know, just go get a guitar
and learn or something.

16:31.508 --> 16:33.343
Guitarists are sexy.

16:33.477 --> 16:36.346
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

16:36.480 --> 16:37.514
Yeah, I will.
I'll learn.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.117
Soon as
I find the time.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.385
I mean,
soon... soon as...

16:41.518 --> 16:43.587
Yeah.
Yeah.

16:45.823 --> 16:48.826
Wouldn't that be nice
if that wasn't a thing?

16:48.960 --> 16:50.527
You know, there's so much
that we want to do,

16:50.662 --> 16:53.965
and there's never
enough time.

16:54.098 --> 16:56.233
And then we die.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.606
Well, that's...
pretty depressing.

17:09.413 --> 17:11.580
What's the point?

17:11.715 --> 17:13.517
God, I...

17:13.651 --> 17:16.252
I don't know, um,
why I'm...

17:16.386 --> 17:18.320
Are you okay?
I have to go. I...

17:18.454 --> 17:20.624
Wait, Ashe...

17:20.758 --> 17:22.960
Hey, hold on. Is your car
around here or something?

17:23.094 --> 17:24.896
Uh, yeah, no, I'm fine.
I'm gonna get an Uber.

17:25.029 --> 17:26.262
Did...
Did I say something?

17:26.396 --> 17:27.898
No, you're fine.
I've just gotta go.

17:28.031 --> 17:30.634
I can give you a ride. I...
Just leave me alone!

17:52.422 --> 17:54.192
Hey Ashe. Uh, it's Will.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.127
Um, hi.
Uh, sorry to bother you.

17:56.259 --> 17:59.563
I'm just... I wanted to call
and say that, um, I had...

17:59.697 --> 18:02.200
I had a really great time
the other day.

18:02.332 --> 18:05.203
Uh, it... it was fun
and it was great.

18:05.335 --> 18:08.472
Um, uh, did I...
I didn't say anything

18:08.605 --> 18:10.607
to, um, upset you, did I?

18:10.742 --> 18:13.343
I mean, you know, i-if I did,
I apologize, I just...

18:13.477 --> 18:17.547
I'm not great with words
and I'm, you know, I...

18:17.682 --> 18:19.851
Did you get home safe or...?

18:19.984 --> 18:22.653
You know, not... not that I'm
worried or anything, you know,

18:22.787 --> 18:24.588
not that I'm <i>not</i> worried.

18:24.722 --> 18:27.591
It's just, you know, I haven't
been on a date in... in a w...

18:27.725 --> 18:29.827
I mean,
I go on a lot of dates, just...

18:29.961 --> 18:32.964
you looked, you know,
you're really attractive.

18:33.097 --> 18:36.299
Hello? Um...

18:36.433 --> 18:37.969
Shit.

18:38.102 --> 18:40.570
Fuck.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.648
<i>It inflates its body
to increase its size</i>

18:51.783 --> 18:53.951
<i>once it has broken
the exoskeleton</i>

18:54.085 --> 18:56.087
<i>that would kill other creatures</i>

18:56.220 --> 18:59.389
<i>from the almost 4,000 species in the world.</i>

18:59.523 --> 19:01.525
<i>Most of them live
in warm places.</i>

19:01.659 --> 19:03.627
<i>The American cockroach
also prefers</i>

19:03.761 --> 19:05.997
<i>this kind of environment.</i>

19:06.130 --> 19:07.832
<i>It has a gradual metamorphosis.</i>

19:07.965 --> 19:10.500
<i>The juvenile is identical
to the adult</i>

19:10.634 --> 19:13.704
<i>except for the lack
of wings and genitals.</i>

21:34.378 --> 21:37.014
You remind me a lot of somebody
that I used to know.

21:38.983 --> 21:40.418
Someone great,
I hope.

21:40.550 --> 21:41.919
You know,
it's weird, actually.

21:42.053 --> 21:43.921
You know how sometimes,
you get fragments of memories

21:44.055 --> 21:46.523
and you can't quite place
where they're from?

21:46.657 --> 21:48.192
Will you remember me?

21:57.702 --> 22:00.037
Of course.

22:00.171 --> 22:02.440
Forever?

22:02.572 --> 22:05.776
Well, nothing is forever,
unfortunately.

22:14.986 --> 22:18.488
Do you ever think about
what's out there?

22:18.621 --> 22:20.490
Like the stuff
that you can't see.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.095
I mean...

22:24.228 --> 22:27.999
the unknown stuff
of the universe

22:28.132 --> 22:31.902
that makes the past,
the present, the future

22:32.036 --> 22:34.105
all just a matter
of perception.

22:37.708 --> 22:40.244
I don't know.
You know, I...

22:42.013 --> 22:44.715
I don't think
it really matters, honestly.

22:44.849 --> 22:46.583
Is that comforting?

22:46.717 --> 22:49.420
Not really.

22:49.552 --> 22:53.891
I mean, we all die before
it even matters anyways, so...

22:54.025 --> 22:55.893
Yeah, but what if
that's the point?

22:56.027 --> 22:59.629
And that's why
it matters.

22:59.764 --> 23:02.532
What if
what's the point?

23:02.666 --> 23:04.235
Mortality.

23:09.639 --> 23:13.144
Like...
what if we don't die?

23:33.563 --> 23:36.534
Sometimes...

23:36.667 --> 23:38.869
I look at the
faces of the people

23:39.003 --> 23:43.240
that I drive
day after day.

23:43.374 --> 23:48.012
And I wonder
if they're actually dead.

23:50.748 --> 23:53.484
They all just seem...

23:53.616 --> 23:58.089
so unhappy,
in so much pain.

23:58.222 --> 24:00.691
Even when
they're trying not to show it.

24:04.295 --> 24:06.697
And then I think...

24:06.831 --> 24:11.836
"What if this whole thing now
we call life

24:12.069 --> 24:15.906
is actually
the afterlife?"

24:16.040 --> 24:21.212
And I'm...
The Ferryman,

24:21.779 --> 24:26.649
driving dead souls
down an endless river,

24:26.784 --> 24:29.753
going nowhere...

24:30.087 --> 24:35.159
because we are all...

24:35.292 --> 24:37.194
already in hell.

24:43.968 --> 24:46.170
Can I ask you
something weird?

24:49.507 --> 24:51.242
Sure.

24:53.110 --> 24:57.047
If, in fact,
there was an afterlife...

24:59.049 --> 25:00.985
...would you wanna
keep living?

25:05.222 --> 25:07.625
Are you okay?

25:07.758 --> 25:09.393
Yeah.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.369
Let me get a condom.

25:34.485 --> 25:37.188
Will...

25:37.321 --> 25:40.659
what do
you think about

25:40.791 --> 25:43.027
when you lay here
alone at night?

25:45.196 --> 25:47.998
Do you ever think about
killing yourself?

26:08.085 --> 26:09.820
We could
do it together.

26:09.954 --> 26:11.956
Wait, Will!

26:12.089 --> 26:15.025
Will, I'm sorry!
I didn't mean it...

27:23.327 --> 27:25.362
Hey.

27:25.496 --> 27:27.231
Hey.

27:29.033 --> 27:30.901
I wanted to,
uh...

27:33.304 --> 27:35.506
That... That thing
we talked about...

27:37.908 --> 27:39.510
Are...
Are you still gonna?

27:39.643 --> 27:40.911
Because I-I think I...

27:41.045 --> 27:44.014
I think I wanna...
I think...

27:44.148 --> 27:47.384
I know a place
where we can go.

27:47.518 --> 27:49.153
I'll text you.

27:49.286 --> 27:51.522
Enjoy your last sunset,
Will.

30:16.166 --> 30:19.671
Hey.
Hey.

30:24.876 --> 30:27.578
Are you nervous?

30:30.214 --> 30:32.449
Are all these people here
for the, um...?

30:32.583 --> 30:35.219
Yeah.
It's quite the party.

30:35.352 --> 30:36.688
Yeah,
I wasn't expecting this.

30:36.821 --> 30:39.691
I thought it would be
a little more like, you know.

30:39.824 --> 30:42.961
Quiet and culty?

30:43.093 --> 30:45.128
Yeah.

30:47.498 --> 30:50.167
So...
So many people here...

30:50.300 --> 30:53.103
Well, you wouldn't want
your last night to be all...

30:53.237 --> 30:55.572
solemn sighs
and chanting, right?

30:55.707 --> 30:57.274
So it makes sense.

30:57.407 --> 30:59.811
And Wreck...
he's... he's amazing.

30:59.944 --> 31:01.545
Wreck?

31:09.253 --> 31:12.556
Welcome to the beginning.

31:12.690 --> 31:15.259
And to the end.

31:15.392 --> 31:17.427
I want to thank you all
for coming.

31:17.561 --> 31:20.297
Now, I may not know all of you,
you may not know each other,

31:20.430 --> 31:25.402
but if you are here,
we all have one thing in common.

31:25.536 --> 31:30.107
We were all born screaming.

31:30.240 --> 31:34.111
Forced from your mother's womb
into a world of pain and horror,

31:34.244 --> 31:35.713
you cried out.

31:35.847 --> 31:38.081
Despite having no tangible
experience nor knowledge,

31:38.215 --> 31:39.516
you knew in that moment

31:39.651 --> 31:41.653
that you would never
be comfortable again.

31:41.786 --> 31:46.256
At best you would be damp,
sticky, cold, alone, afraid.

31:46.390 --> 31:50.193
Over time you learned to forget

31:50.327 --> 31:53.363
how inescapably awful it is
to be alive.

31:53.497 --> 31:54.832
You spent the next
several decades

31:54.966 --> 31:57.134
trying to convince yourself

31:57.267 --> 32:00.604
that your life would get better.

32:00.738 --> 32:02.472
But it didn't.

32:02.606 --> 32:03.741
Did it?

32:03.875 --> 32:05.677
Watching TV didn't make you
a better person.

32:05.810 --> 32:08.445
Graduating high school didn't
fill the hole in your stomach.

32:08.579 --> 32:10.080
The drugs didn't fix
your headaches,

32:10.213 --> 32:11.683
and your mind-numbing job
didn't bring you any closer

32:11.816 --> 32:13.851
to realizing why you bothered
to survive

32:13.985 --> 32:16.420
this long in the first place.

32:16.553 --> 32:21.558
Going in circles when you're
not already falling down.

32:21.793 --> 32:25.063
You here today are among
the enlightened few

32:25.195 --> 32:28.599
who have realized that there is
no top to this mountain.

32:28.733 --> 32:31.602
That these are not clouds
obscuring its apex,

32:31.736 --> 32:33.503
but a solid wall.

32:33.637 --> 32:36.841
You are suffering for no reason.

32:36.975 --> 32:39.811
For no reward.

32:39.944 --> 32:42.579
And you know what?

32:42.714 --> 32:47.284
This is the best news
you've ever heard.

32:47.417 --> 32:49.319
No one cares if you exist,

32:49.453 --> 32:52.090
and humanity will be
stardust again...

32:55.459 --> 32:58.328
Fuck 'em!
Who cares?

32:58.462 --> 33:02.834
Tonight we raise our glass
to the abyss

33:02.967 --> 33:05.469
that we've feared for so long.

33:05.602 --> 33:09.339
And we drink to oblivion.

33:09.473 --> 33:12.576
Tonight, we let go of the things
that we pretend matter.

33:12.710 --> 33:16.413
Tonight we take responsibility
for our humanity.

33:16.546 --> 33:18.582
We will reject our mortality.

33:18.716 --> 33:20.918
Tonight we will look straight
in the eyes of anyone

33:21.052 --> 33:23.286
who's ever told us
this life is worth living

33:23.420 --> 33:25.355
and we say, "You were wrong!"

33:30.061 --> 33:31.495
Ashe, can I say something?
What?

33:31.628 --> 33:33.865
Wait one second.
I just want to tell you something.

33:33.998 --> 33:35.532
What's wrong?
Nothing.

33:35.667 --> 33:37.234
You okay?
Yeah, I just...

33:37.367 --> 33:38.936
Hey, you were amazing.

33:39.070 --> 33:40.337
Thanks.

33:40.470 --> 33:43.273
Will, this is Wreck.

33:43.407 --> 33:45.777
Hey, nice to meet you.

33:45.910 --> 33:48.245
Will's the guy
I was telling you about.

33:48.378 --> 33:51.615
Oh, yeah, yeah,
the bus driver.

33:51.749 --> 33:53.951
Can I speak to you
for a second?

33:54.085 --> 33:55.820
Sure.

33:58.355 --> 33:59.857
So let me
get this straight.

33:59.991 --> 34:02.392
You've been dating fucking baby
Jim Jones here the whole time,

34:02.526 --> 34:04.528
and what, I meant, like...
I meant nothing to you?

34:04.662 --> 34:06.396
I was, like, what, like...
like a fling or something?

34:06.530 --> 34:09.701
No, it's not...
Not the whole time.

34:10.835 --> 34:13.503
So, what, you were, like,
recruiting me?

34:13.637 --> 34:15.773
No, it's not like that.

34:15.907 --> 34:17.507
We had fun,
but it was casual.

34:17.641 --> 34:20.409
C-Casual? Casual?
Ashe, what the fuck? Casual?

34:20.543 --> 34:24.313
Look, I'm not interested
in you like that.

34:27.784 --> 34:30.554
I mean, can I...
can I change your mind?

34:30.688 --> 34:32.556
No.

34:32.690 --> 34:34.623
Because I'm mediocre.
No.

34:34.759 --> 34:37.327
Alright, look, just...
just tell me what I did.

34:37.460 --> 34:39.429
Tell me what I did wrong.
Nothing.

34:39.563 --> 34:41.099
Please, please, please just
tell me what I did wrong.

34:41.231 --> 34:44.367
Can you just calm down?
This is a fucking nightmare.

34:44.501 --> 34:46.335
Why did you...

34:46.469 --> 34:47.839
Please just tell me
what I did.

34:47.972 --> 34:50.607
It's not your fault.
Then it's your fault!

34:53.409 --> 34:55.411
I'm sorry.
I don't care.

34:55.545 --> 34:56.914
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't mean that.

34:57.047 --> 35:00.317
It's just I can't give you
what you want, Will.

35:00.450 --> 35:02.519
I'm not your girlfriend.
I'm just your friend. Ashe, I love you.

35:02.653 --> 35:05.022
That's why I invited you here.
Ashe, I love you.

35:05.156 --> 35:07.357
I'm in love with you, okay?
Listen to me, listen to me.

35:07.491 --> 35:10.327
Will, can you stop? Listen, before
I had you in my life, I had nothing.

35:10.460 --> 35:12.029
Nothing, alright?

35:12.163 --> 35:14.031
I was low when you met me,
but I'm better now. No, mnh-mnh.

35:14.165 --> 35:16.134
You helped me do that, alright?
Ashe, you're the most...

35:16.266 --> 35:17.935
You barely even know me.
Ashe.

35:18.069 --> 35:19.837
And you're gonna fuck this up for me.
Ashe, come on. Please, Ashe.

35:19.971 --> 35:22.039
Just get off of me.

37:50.121 --> 37:52.223
Fuck.

39:32.790 --> 39:33.958
There's no time.

39:34.091 --> 39:37.228
- Exit the bus.
- Get off of me, asshole.

39:38.729 --> 39:40.831
Is that S.O.P?

39:40.965 --> 39:42.333
I've never
done that before.

39:44.335 --> 39:46.170
Well, that was awesome.

40:49.567 --> 40:53.671
Yeah, I'm working at home today.
Car's out of commission.

40:53.804 --> 40:56.807
Yeah, yes.

40:56.941 --> 40:59.410
Mm. Any time.

40:59.543 --> 41:01.611
Yeah, I'll be here.

41:03.013 --> 41:05.950
Um... Yeah, I guess
it's going to be fine.

41:06.083 --> 41:09.086
I mean, if he's working
during the day, yeah.

41:09.220 --> 41:10.387
What, at 9:00?

41:10.521 --> 41:12.156
Yeah, I'll be here.

41:12.289 --> 41:13.691
Mm-hmm.

41:13.824 --> 41:15.693
Okay, thanks, Kelly.

41:15.826 --> 41:17.928
Yeah, alright, bye.

41:29.707 --> 41:31.675
I tried replacing
the battery.

41:31.809 --> 41:33.677
But no dice.

41:33.811 --> 41:36.046
Well...

41:36.380 --> 41:39.817
Sounds like
your transmission's fucked.

41:39.950 --> 41:42.353
That's bad, isn't it?

41:42.486 --> 41:43.454
It's not good.

41:43.587 --> 41:44.655
Fuck.

41:44.788 --> 41:46.557
Yeah, fuck.

41:46.690 --> 41:48.792
Can you fix it?
Oh, I can fix it.

41:48.926 --> 41:50.394
Just gonna
take me a while.

41:50.528 --> 41:53.264
And how much is that
going to cost me?

41:55.766 --> 41:58.269
Tell you what,
you're Kelly's friend.

41:58.402 --> 42:00.871
I'll take it back to my place,
work on it there.

42:01.005 --> 42:03.073
I'll charge you parts,
towing.

42:03.207 --> 42:05.976
Labor's free.

42:06.110 --> 42:07.945
You don't have to do that
for me.

42:08.078 --> 42:11.849
I don't have to do
anything, really.

42:11.982 --> 42:13.751
Whose bike is that?

42:16.120 --> 42:17.721
That would be mine.

42:17.855 --> 42:19.957
'91 FXRS.

42:20.090 --> 42:23.160
That's a nice bike.

42:23.294 --> 42:24.428
Does it run?

42:24.562 --> 42:26.363
Nope.

42:26.497 --> 42:27.898
That's a damn shame.

42:28.032 --> 42:32.870
Yeah, I should probably
fix it, but, you know.

42:33.003 --> 42:34.838
Should let me fix that.

42:34.972 --> 42:36.874
I don't really have the money
for this.

42:37.007 --> 42:39.977
Ah, so you prefer it
as lawn art?

42:40.110 --> 42:41.912
I'm probably
going to sell it.

42:42.046 --> 42:43.180
Because even
when it does work,

42:43.314 --> 42:46.750
I always find an excuse
not to ride it.

42:46.884 --> 42:48.285
Interested?

42:48.419 --> 42:51.989
Tell you what,
you give me the bike,

42:52.122 --> 42:54.992
I'll fix your car
for free.

42:55.125 --> 42:57.094
Oh. Uh, I don't know.

42:57.228 --> 42:58.896
Alright, I'll fix your car
for free

42:59.029 --> 43:00.864
anytime something
goes wrong.

43:00.998 --> 43:03.167
You get
a lifetime warranty.

43:03.300 --> 43:06.270
And you can come over to ride
the bike whenever you want.

43:06.403 --> 43:07.871
I'm tempted.

43:08.005 --> 43:10.140
You're a suspiciously
generous stranger.

43:10.274 --> 43:12.109
You know that?

43:12.243 --> 43:14.778
I just hate seeing
beautiful things rot away.

43:18.115 --> 43:20.284
Um...

43:20.417 --> 43:22.753
I'll find a way
to pay you somehow.

43:29.159 --> 43:32.162
Do you by any chance

43:34.098 --> 43:38.569
So Sherlock Holmes
and Watson are traveling...

43:38.703 --> 43:40.371
Detectives.
They are detectives.

43:40.504 --> 43:41.572
This is true.

43:41.706 --> 43:43.841
So Sherlock
turns to Watson.

43:43.974 --> 43:45.109
He shakes him awake.

43:45.242 --> 43:48.680
He says,
"Watson, what do you see?"

43:48.812 --> 43:50.914
Watson says, "I see stars.

43:51.048 --> 43:52.216
There's so many stars,

43:52.349 --> 43:53.851
that means there must be
other planets,

43:53.984 --> 43:55.452
and other planets
means there's other species.

43:55.586 --> 43:57.521
There may be other life
on other planets."

43:57.656 --> 44:02.126
Sherlock says to him, "No, you
idiot, somebody stole our tent."

44:02.259 --> 44:04.962
Give me a second.

44:07.031 --> 44:09.668
Alright, so you walk
into the woods with someone

44:09.800 --> 44:11.135
and you come across
an animal.

44:11.268 --> 44:13.404
Describe me
what this animal is.

44:13.537 --> 44:15.272
Alright, well,
first thing comes to mind,

44:15.406 --> 44:17.341
I guess I'm going to
say a wolf.

44:17.474 --> 44:18.609
A wolf?
Yeah.

44:18.743 --> 44:20.344
Alright, do you touch it?
Do you talk to it?

44:20.477 --> 44:22.346
What do you do?
Anything?

44:22.479 --> 44:23.447
Do you look at it?

44:23.580 --> 44:25.249
Well, I assume it's trying
to kill me.

44:27.251 --> 44:28.452
Alright, so what else?

44:28.585 --> 44:31.088
So I'd probably try
to kill it back.

44:31.221 --> 44:32.623
Okay.

44:32.757 --> 44:34.158
Do you?

44:34.291 --> 44:35.192
Yeah.

44:36.160 --> 44:37.528
There's more to this?

44:37.662 --> 44:39.596
Yeah.
You keep walking.

44:39.731 --> 44:41.298
Your dream house.
Mm-hmm.

44:41.432 --> 44:43.567
Does it have a fence
or no fence around it?

44:43.702 --> 44:45.002
No, no fence.
No fence.

44:45.135 --> 44:46.303
You go outside,
around the back.

44:46.437 --> 44:49.808
You come to
a body of water.

44:49.973 --> 44:51.175
Describe me
the body of water.

44:51.308 --> 44:53.410
Describe you the body of water?
Yeah.

44:53.544 --> 44:55.814
Uh, it'd probably
be a river.

44:55.946 --> 44:58.048
A river, okay.

44:58.182 --> 45:02.353
The wolf represents,
like, your problems in life,

45:02.486 --> 45:04.922
and, like, big, small the animal...
Yeah.

45:05.055 --> 45:06.323
...is how big
your problems are.

45:06.457 --> 45:08.325
And, like, your physical contact
with the animal

45:08.459 --> 45:10.394
is how you're
dealing with them.

45:10.527 --> 45:11.962
So I failed that test.

45:12.096 --> 45:14.231
No, you were trying
to fight it off.

45:14.365 --> 45:17.368
You said no fence,
which means you're very spon...

45:17.501 --> 45:18.837
How do you say that word?
Spont...

45:18.969 --> 45:20.037
Spontaneous?

45:20.170 --> 45:21.271
Spontaneous, yes.

45:21.405 --> 45:22.539
Okay.

45:22.674 --> 45:24.843
The body of water
describes your sex drive.

45:24.975 --> 45:26.410
You said a river.

45:26.543 --> 45:29.046
I'm not sure what that says.
It's better than a puddle.

45:29.179 --> 45:31.949
Should've said ocean.

45:44.228 --> 45:47.531
Ah, so we're
into pills now.

45:47.665 --> 45:48.867
Purely medical.

45:48.999 --> 45:50.901
Didn't used to be, though.

45:52.837 --> 45:55.439
Do you really need
to take those?

45:57.074 --> 45:59.711
I don't think you'd like me
if I didn't.

45:59.844 --> 46:01.178
Maybe.

46:01.311 --> 46:03.046
Maybe I'd like you better.

46:11.756 --> 46:14.491
Alright, you win.

47:02.907 --> 47:04.641
Frederick?

47:04.776 --> 47:06.643
Freddie?

47:06.778 --> 47:08.479
Here, boy.

47:08.612 --> 47:09.613
Hey.

47:17.554 --> 47:19.056
Freddie.

47:19.189 --> 47:22.426
Here, boy.

47:44.682 --> 47:47.417
Well, that's
pretty depressing.

47:54.191 --> 47:56.426
What's the point?

47:56.560 --> 47:58.228
God, I...

47:58.362 --> 48:00.464
I don't know,
um, why...

48:00.597 --> 48:01.465
Are you okay?

48:01.598 --> 48:03.433
I have to go.
I'm sorry.

49:52.076 --> 49:54.578
Hey, it's Ashe.

49:58.016 --> 49:59.851
No. Um...

49:59.984 --> 50:01.485
This might seem a little weird.

50:01.618 --> 50:04.154
I just wanted to know
if you could come over tonight.

50:07.324 --> 50:09.559
No, i-it's okay.
I just...

50:09.694 --> 50:11.929
I just wanted some company
is all.

50:16.266 --> 50:19.169
No, it's okay about the car.

50:19.302 --> 50:20.705
It's... It's fine.

50:24.508 --> 50:26.778
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

50:28.913 --> 50:32.449
And the cool thing is, is
that the particle already knows

50:32.582 --> 50:35.820
whether or not
it's going to be perceived

50:35.953 --> 50:38.723
before it even happens.

50:38.856 --> 50:42.526
And this proves that particles
are affected

50:42.660 --> 50:46.831
just as much by future events
as they are by the past.

50:46.964 --> 50:48.632
Well, that's incredible.

50:48.766 --> 50:50.333
So naturally,
you're going to tell me

50:50.467 --> 50:52.670
that there's no such thing
as free will, right?

50:52.804 --> 50:55.740
That our future
is already decided for us.

50:55.873 --> 51:01.079
See, the really incredible thing
is it's exactly the opposite.

51:02.080 --> 51:07.484
It's not that the future is set
and so our choices don't matter.

51:07.852 --> 51:10.253
It's more like...

51:10.387 --> 51:15.592
...you can make
choices based on future events.

51:16.326 --> 51:18.528
Time is...

51:18.663 --> 51:21.431
It's just this big
feedback loop.

51:21.565 --> 51:24.234
The past, the present,
the future...

51:24.367 --> 51:28.538
they all just flow
into one another.

51:28.673 --> 51:32.242
A creature exists
throughout time

51:32.375 --> 51:33.711
and so time
is a part of it.

51:33.845 --> 51:36.646
Nothing ever
really changes.

51:36.781 --> 51:41.284
We just are ourselves throughout
the course of existence.

51:43.921 --> 51:48.358
So we can change the past
if it's also the future?

51:48.492 --> 51:51.628
We can change how we choose
to perceive it.

51:51.763 --> 51:53.798
How it fits
into our timeline.

51:55.700 --> 51:59.804
Oh. Hey, I got
that bike running.

51:59.937 --> 52:00.972
Hmm.

52:29.200 --> 52:31.568
Are you sure?

52:31.702 --> 52:32.837
Yeah.

52:36.808 --> 52:40.111
There's something I need
to ask you first.

52:40.244 --> 52:43.781
If you knew for a fact

52:43.915 --> 52:47.652
that there was an existence
after this one,

52:47.785 --> 52:51.488
would you still choose
to live?

52:51.621 --> 52:53.124
What are you
talking about?

52:53.257 --> 52:55.325
Just answer the question.

53:00.530 --> 53:03.600
Would I be myself
in this hypothetical?

53:03.734 --> 53:06.403
Well, that would depend on
how you choose to perceive it.

53:15.612 --> 53:17.148
I would choose death.

54:00.557 --> 54:01.993
<i>Hey, Ashe.
It's Will.</i>

58:14.145 --> 58:17.281
We do not feed on cows
nor chickens

58:17.414 --> 58:20.251
nor grain nor vegetables.

58:20.384 --> 58:22.653
We have but one prey.

58:24.088 --> 58:27.458
When our numbers
are sufficient...

58:27.591 --> 58:29.426
we simply stop recruiting.

58:29.560 --> 58:32.062
And we feed.

58:32.196 --> 58:36.901
Overpopulation breeds famine
and suffering.

58:37.034 --> 58:39.436
These are human concepts.

58:40.137 --> 58:45.342
It is a cancerous belief
that all life is precious.

58:46.710 --> 58:47.811
We are not mankind.

58:47.945 --> 58:49.713
We do not wish
to rule this world,

58:49.847 --> 58:52.516
simply to put it back
into place...

58:52.651 --> 58:55.152
into order.

58:55.286 --> 59:00.157
Everything that you see here
and everything that is to come

59:00.291 --> 59:05.496
is a result of mankind's
irrational fear of death.

59:06.063 --> 59:09.166
He fears death so much
because he chose to forget.

59:09.300 --> 59:13.938
Something mankind says
all the time

59:14.071 --> 59:16.707
but doesn't really,
truly believe.

59:16.840 --> 59:18.809
Something we will
remind them of.

59:21.879 --> 59:24.048
That death...

59:24.181 --> 59:26.917
it's just another part
of life.

01:00:27.478 --> 01:00:29.246
The ceremony's only for those
who are truly ready

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:32.916
to cast aside everything and
become one with the universe.

01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:36.353
On Friday we will leave
for a new city.

01:00:36.487 --> 01:00:40.891
You have until then to sever
your ties to this world.

01:00:41.025 --> 01:00:43.127
Is there anyone
you'd like to invite?

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.329
Someone you can't stand
to lose?

01:01:20.665 --> 01:01:22.533
I'm not your girlfriend.
I'm just your friend.

01:01:22.667 --> 01:01:25.402
That's why I invited you here.
Ashe, I love you.

01:01:25.536 --> 01:01:27.037
I'm in love with you, Ashe.
Oh, come on, Will.

01:01:27.171 --> 01:01:28.405
I'm in love with you.

01:01:28.539 --> 01:01:29.973
Alright, before I had you...
No, just stop.

01:01:30.107 --> 01:01:32.076
Before I had you in my life,
I had nothing.

01:01:32.209 --> 01:01:34.044
I had nothing, alright?

01:01:34.178 --> 01:01:37.414
I was low when you met me...
You barely even know me.

01:01:37.548 --> 01:01:39.616
Okay, and you're gonna fuck this up for me.
No, don't do this.

01:01:39.751 --> 01:01:41.251
Don't you touch me!

01:02:08.112 --> 01:02:10.614
Fuck!

01:02:12.616 --> 01:02:13.951
It was gonna be perfect!

01:02:14.084 --> 01:02:16.153
He didn't get bitten.
He didn't finish the ritual.

01:02:16.286 --> 01:02:17.388
That's his own fault!

01:02:17.521 --> 01:02:18.956
So what's gonna
happen to him?

01:02:20.324 --> 01:02:21.425
Wreck, what's gonna
happen to him

01:02:21.558 --> 01:02:23.060
if he didn't
finish the ritual?

01:02:23.193 --> 01:02:24.928
He's going to taste
a glimpse of eternity.

01:02:25.062 --> 01:02:26.096
And then
he's going to die.

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:27.531
Well,
then we gotta fix it.

01:02:27.665 --> 01:02:28.666
Who gives a shit?

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.967
He fucked up the ritual.

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:31.235
He ruined everything!

01:02:31.368 --> 01:02:32.936
Fuck! I mean, we'll just
bring him back.

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:34.371
He can get bitten.

01:02:34.505 --> 01:02:37.975
You have to let go
of your mortal ties.

01:02:38.108 --> 01:02:39.209
He wasn't ready.

01:02:39.343 --> 01:02:41.245
Bringing him here
was a mistake.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.883
He's in love with you,
Ashe.

01:02:45.015 --> 01:02:47.084
But you're mine.

01:02:47.217 --> 01:02:49.586
And I won't share you.

01:02:49.721 --> 01:02:51.321
He's just a friend.

01:02:51.455 --> 01:02:52.489
Fuck that.

01:02:52.623 --> 01:02:55.392
You don't need
friends like him.

01:02:55.526 --> 01:02:57.928
And if I see that shithead
back here again,

01:02:58.061 --> 01:03:00.597
I <i>will</i> kill him myself.

01:03:14.278 --> 01:03:16.046
What's going to happen
to the rest of the blood

01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:17.548
in the fountain?

01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:21.418
Nothing now.

01:03:21.552 --> 01:03:25.189
It's all ruined.
We'll have to reschedule.

01:03:25.322 --> 01:03:27.991
Is it all yours?
What?

01:03:28.125 --> 01:03:30.160
In the fountain,
there's a lot of blood.

01:03:30.294 --> 01:03:32.262
It's all yours
because the initiates,

01:03:32.396 --> 01:03:34.231
they have to
drink your blood.

01:03:34.364 --> 01:03:35.132
Right?

01:03:35.265 --> 01:03:37.167
Not exactly.

01:03:37.301 --> 01:03:38.469
Doesn't all
have to be mine.

01:03:38.602 --> 01:03:41.773
It's just somebody
in my bloodline.

01:03:41.906 --> 01:03:43.640
Why?

01:03:45.677 --> 01:03:47.478
I want just your blood.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.649
I'm really sorry
about tonight.

01:03:52.784 --> 01:03:57.120
I was feeling
really weird.

01:03:59.657 --> 01:04:02.426
I love you, Wreck.

01:04:02.559 --> 01:04:04.561
And I don't want to be
just another initiate

01:04:04.696 --> 01:04:07.564
drinking diluted blood.

01:04:07.699 --> 01:04:10.367
Don't make me go along
with the masses.

01:04:12.436 --> 01:04:15.272
I want you to drink me.

01:04:15.405 --> 01:04:18.108
And I wanna drink you.

01:04:18.242 --> 01:04:19.643
Right now.

01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:27.618
Are you sure?

01:04:27.752 --> 01:04:29.319
Yeah.

01:05:25.843 --> 01:05:27.644
Drink up.

01:05:27.779 --> 01:05:29.747
It's my fault.

01:05:29.881 --> 01:05:31.515
I have to fix it.

01:05:31.648 --> 01:05:33.083
Drink.
Drink.

01:05:35.419 --> 01:05:38.155
I'm gonna save him.

01:05:38.288 --> 01:05:40.424
Ashe, you need to drink.

01:05:40.557 --> 01:05:41.525
I will.

01:06:00.477 --> 01:06:01.545
Ashe!

01:06:16.728 --> 01:06:18.595
- Sir, do we proceed...
- Leave.

01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:21.164
But, Wreck, what do we do
with all these people?

01:06:21.298 --> 01:06:23.166
Get out!

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:24.368
You heard him.
Get out.

01:06:24.501 --> 01:06:26.269
Bring it down
just a little bit.

01:06:26.403 --> 01:06:28.338
Come on, move it!

01:06:28.472 --> 01:06:30.474
The ritual is canceled.
Get out.

01:06:34.277 --> 01:06:35.813
Get the fuck out.

01:06:46.658 --> 01:06:47.959
Aah!

01:07:16.854 --> 01:07:18.488
Will?

01:07:22.026 --> 01:07:23.326
Will?

01:07:29.299 --> 01:07:30.634
Will?

01:07:37.374 --> 01:07:38.810
Will!

01:07:51.588 --> 01:07:53.691
Alight, man, where to?

01:08:19.616 --> 01:08:21.853
Will, stop!

01:08:46.978 --> 01:08:48.478
What can I get you?

01:08:48.612 --> 01:08:51.816
Oh, shit, man.
Are you okay?

01:08:51.948 --> 01:08:53.885
Yeah.

01:08:54.018 --> 01:08:55.352
I'm not a...

01:08:55.484 --> 01:08:57.087
Just... Just this.

01:09:16.606 --> 01:09:19.076
Are you sure
you're okay?

01:09:22.511 --> 01:09:25.314
I'm so thirsty.

01:09:25.448 --> 01:09:27.218
Oh, shit, man.

01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:30.554
Listen, I don't want
any trouble.

01:09:30.688 --> 01:09:33.057
The fuck are you
doing here?

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:36.861
The river house?

01:09:36.993 --> 01:09:38.296
Bro, I don't know
where it is, man.

01:09:38.428 --> 01:09:39.831
Wait, wait, where am I?

01:09:39.964 --> 01:09:42.033
The hell, man? You g...
You getting out or what, man?

01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:45.069
Aah! Aah!

01:09:59.549 --> 01:10:01.018
Sir, are you okay?

01:10:12.462 --> 01:10:14.431
Help me.

01:10:14.564 --> 01:10:16.133
I'm trying, kid, just...

01:10:16.267 --> 01:10:19.502
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look at me. You there?

01:10:19.636 --> 01:10:20.972
I'm gonna take you
to the hospital, man.

01:10:21.105 --> 01:10:21.973
Just sit tight, alright?

01:10:22.106 --> 01:10:23.607
Hey, am I dead?

01:10:23.741 --> 01:10:26.376
- What?
- Am I dead?

01:10:26.509 --> 01:10:28.713
Wh-What?

01:10:28.846 --> 01:10:30.547
- Where is she?
- Who?

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.209
Are you listening to me?

01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:00.878
I said I'm gonna
fucking shoot you

01:11:01.012 --> 01:11:02.445
if you don't get
outta here, man.

01:11:46.657 --> 01:11:49.459
You got 10
fucking seconds, man.

01:11:51.262 --> 01:11:52.863
10.

01:12:04.175 --> 01:12:05.743
Hey. Sir!

01:12:05.876 --> 01:12:07.011
Wait.

01:12:07.144 --> 01:12:09.213
Aah! Aah!

01:12:09.347 --> 01:12:10.948
Nine.

01:12:11.082 --> 01:12:13.951
You think you can just walk
into my house,

01:12:14.085 --> 01:12:16.687
ruin everything
that I've worked towards,

01:12:16.821 --> 01:12:19.023
and then you can
just ask me for help?

01:12:19.156 --> 01:12:21.158
I'm glad
I didn't drink you.

01:12:21.292 --> 01:12:23.828
Drink me?

01:12:23.961 --> 01:12:26.629
You can feel it,
can't you?

01:12:26.764 --> 01:12:28.466
Like everything's
happening at once.

01:12:28.598 --> 01:12:30.500
What can I get ya?
Shit, man.

01:12:30.633 --> 01:12:32.036
Eight!
You okay?

01:12:32.169 --> 01:12:33.170
I'm so thirsty.

01:12:33.304 --> 01:12:35.673
Thirsty? Alright, come on.
Let's go.

01:12:35.806 --> 01:12:37.041
You alright?

01:12:37.174 --> 01:12:38.209
Aah!

01:12:53.224 --> 01:12:54.091
Seven.

01:12:54.225 --> 01:12:55.926
Drink me?

01:13:06.337 --> 01:13:08.072
Oh, man,
that was fun.

01:13:08.205 --> 01:13:09.774
You know...

01:13:09.907 --> 01:13:13.277
you are exactly what's wrong
with humanity.

01:13:13.411 --> 01:13:14.278
Like, exac...

01:13:14.412 --> 01:13:15.880
And now...

01:13:16.013 --> 01:13:18.249
...you're stuck between worlds.

01:13:18.382 --> 01:13:20.885
You sad motherfucker.

01:13:21.919 --> 01:13:23.187
S-S-Seven.

01:13:25.423 --> 01:13:27.124
God, I need to find her.

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.064
The walls
of time crumbling around you.

01:13:35.933 --> 01:13:38.536
You're getting a taste
of immortality.

01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:39.670
Five.

01:13:54.418 --> 01:13:56.320
Four.

01:13:58.422 --> 01:13:59.890
The river.

01:14:02.393 --> 01:14:04.395
Three.

01:14:10.534 --> 01:14:11.569
Two.

01:14:33.958 --> 01:14:34.992
Just kill me.

01:14:35.126 --> 01:14:37.962
One.

01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:41.252
Will.

01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:46.457
Will.

01:16:49.493 --> 01:16:51.462
Will.

01:16:51.595 --> 01:16:52.796
Will!

01:21:40.752 --> 01:21:42.486
I'm sorry.

01:21:44.856 --> 01:21:47.190
I'm so sorry.

01:22:14.585 --> 01:22:17.187
We all die before it even
matters anyways, so...

01:22:17.321 --> 01:22:19.389
Yeah, but what if
that's the point

01:22:19.523 --> 01:22:21.491
and that's why
it matters?

01:22:21.625 --> 01:22:23.661
What if
what's the point?

01:22:23.795 --> 01:22:25.195
Mortality.

01:22:51.321 --> 01:22:52.790
Will, stop!

01:23:54.986 --> 01:23:56.520
Wreck!

01:23:58.690 --> 01:24:00.257
Wreck!

01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:01.525
I'm gonna kill you, Wreck.

01:24:01.659 --> 01:24:03.493
I didn't do anything to you.

01:24:03.627 --> 01:24:05.228
Shut up!

01:24:05.362 --> 01:24:07.531
You've ruined
everything.

01:24:07.665 --> 01:24:09.834
That's a matter
of perception.

01:25:16.934 --> 01:25:18.002
Aah!

01:25:42.994 --> 01:25:45.595
I'm going to
kill you, Wreck.

01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:46.998
That's a matter
of perception.

01:25:47.131 --> 01:25:48.833
Matter of perception.

01:26:08.786 --> 01:26:10.922
I've already seen it.

01:26:14.692 --> 01:26:16.694
You don't even know
where I am.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.735
I know where you'll be.

01:26:26.971 --> 01:26:27.839
Aah!

01:26:31.042 --> 01:26:32.375
You ruined everything!

01:26:32.509 --> 01:26:35.046
Your life was worth nothing
to begin with!

01:26:37.982 --> 01:26:39.416
I'll kill you!

01:26:47.490 --> 01:26:49.093
Will, stop!

01:26:55.166 --> 01:26:56.868
Stop!

01:26:59.003 --> 01:27:02.073
Please! Please!

01:27:15.019 --> 01:27:16.486
Fuck you.

01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:19.156
No, fuck you.

01:27:57.695 --> 01:27:58.963
Will.

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:25.122
Aah!

01:29:15.006 --> 01:29:16.207
Perfect.

01:29:39.730 --> 01:29:41.932
We're all mediocre,
Will.

01:29:44.735 --> 01:29:46.303
I have to disagree.
