What's up?

08:51.072 --> 08:53.908
Tia and Nia
have chicken pox.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.995
Twins.
They have to do
everything together.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.748
I know I've already
had chicken pox,

08:59.748 --> 09:02.417
but just hearin'
those words makes
me itchy all over.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.253
Anyway, since
the girls are sick,

09:05.253 --> 09:07.297
we can't sing at
the open mic on Saturday.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.590

sign up again when
the girls are better?

only once a month,

Alisha, you have
a great voice.

sing on your own?

09:17.390 --> 09:19.350

on stage with them.

Well, you're blocking
everyone's view.

19:41.472 --> 19:43.265
You're right.
How rude of me.

19:46.727 --> 19:47.561
How you doin', Syd?

Okay, I guess.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.776
Just disappointed with myself

19:53.776 --> 19:56.320
for sitting here while
my little cousin is

19:56.320 --> 19:57.988
brave enough
to get up there and sing.

when you feel
more comfortable.
