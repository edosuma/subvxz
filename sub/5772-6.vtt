[phone buzzing]

00:19.320 --> 00:21.455
[phone chimes]

00:25.426 --> 00:27.395
WHERE?

00:30.364 --> 00:31.765
SWEETHEART,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

00:31.799 --> 00:33.367
I'VE BEEN WAITING HERE
THIS WHOLE TIME!

00:33.401 --> 00:35.336
LET'S GO IN.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.671
IT'S THE GODFATHER II,
THE MOVIE THAT RAISED ME.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.473
IF I'M NOT IN MY SEAT
BEFORE THE TRIVIA GAME,

00:39.507 --> 00:42.276
THE WHOLE FILM-GOING EXPERIENCE
IS RUINED FOR ME, IT'S RUINED.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.477
BABY, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:43.511 --> 00:46.314
THE WHOLE FILM-GOING EXPERIENCE
IS CHECKING YOUR PHONE,

00:46.347 --> 00:47.115
PEOPLE WATCHING,

00:47.148 --> 00:48.749
AND OVER-THE-PANTS MAKE-OUT.
HONK!

00:48.782 --> 00:50.618
HEY, DON'T DO THAT HERE.
YEAH, IT WAS COOL.

00:50.651 --> 00:51.685
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO,
COME ON.

00:51.719 --> 00:56.190
HEY, CAN WE GET TWO TICKETS,
ONE ADULT AND ONE CHILD?

00:56.224 --> 00:57.591
I'M SORRY, WE'RE SOLD OUT.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.227
(both)
WHAT?

00:59.260 --> 01:00.761
YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR AN HOUR,
AND YOU DIDN'T BUY TICKETS?

01:00.794 --> 01:02.696
(Danny)
WHEN'S IT PLAYING NEXT?
TOMORROW AT NOON.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.165
TOMORROW AT NOON.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

01:04.198 --> 01:05.366
HOW COULD ANYONE WANT TO SEE
THIS MOVIE?

01:05.399 --> 01:06.634
I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT.
OKAY, OKAY.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.302
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD
OF THE GODFATHER?

01:08.336 --> 01:11.305
[dance music]

01:11.339 --> 01:13.107
*

01:15.409 --> 01:16.310
HEY.

01:16.344 --> 01:19.180
HUH, ACCORDING TO MY
GENUINE QUARTZ ACCURACY,

01:19.213 --> 01:20.181
YOU'RE LATE.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.582
WHAT?
YOU'RE LATE.

01:21.615 --> 01:22.750
I'M NOT LATE.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.319
IT'S 9:18,
WHICH IS PRACTICALLY 9:15,

01:25.353 --> 01:28.289
WHICH IS BASICALLY 9:00.
DANNY, IF ANYTHING, I'M EARLY.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.124
MINDY, WE'VE BEEN DATING
FOR SEVEN MONTHS,

01:30.158 --> 01:31.392
AND YOU'RE NEVER ON TIME
FOR ANYTHING.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.262
OKAY,
OCCASIONALLY BEING LATE

01:34.295 --> 01:36.897
IS JUST PART OF MY SPONTANEOUS
AND FUN DEAL, DANNY.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.399
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE BAD
WITH THE GOOD.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.500
WHY CAN'T I JUST TAKE
THE GOOD WITH THE GOOD,

01:39.533 --> 01:40.701
LIKE YOU GET WITH ME?

01:40.734 --> 01:42.670
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I HAVE TO GO TO CHURCH WITH YOU

01:42.703 --> 01:44.405
EVERY SUNDAY.
I'M NOT EVEN CATHOLIC.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.739
SWEETHEART, DON'T BE MAD.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.275
OKAY.
OKAY?

01:47.308 --> 01:49.410
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.711
[knocking at the door]

01:50.744 --> 01:53.314
DR. CASTELLANO,
DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?

01:53.347 --> 01:55.283
DR. FISHMAN,
YES, OF COURSE!

01:55.316 --> 01:59.187
OH, BOY, PARDON ME FOR THE MESS.
I FEEL REALLY--

01:59.220 --> 02:00.488
I'LL MOVE THAT.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.390
EMBARRASSED.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.325
JUST KIDDING.
REAL NEATNIK.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.893
OKAY.
YOU WANT ME TO CALL THE OTHERS?

02:05.926 --> 02:07.728
I'LL JUST GET 'EM IN HERE.
NO, ACTUALLY,

02:07.761 --> 02:09.930
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
OKAY.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.733
THERE'S A NEW MENTAL HEALTH
SEMINAR THAT I'M STARTING

02:12.766 --> 02:15.836
FOR AT-RISK HOSPITAL PERSONNEL.
BOOM.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.472
I THINK YOU COULD BENEFIT
BY HAVING AN OUTLET

02:18.506 --> 02:19.873
FOR YOUR UNCOMFORTABLE
FEELINGS.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.842
WAIT A MINUTE, MY MENTAL HEALTH
IS PERFECT, OKAY?

02:21.875 --> 02:24.445
AND I DO HAVE AN OUTLET.
HIS NAME'S FATHER FRANCIS,

02:24.478 --> 02:26.547
HE'S 97,
AND HE ONLY SPEAKS LATIN.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.649
STOP IT.
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,

02:28.682 --> 02:29.917
YOU THREATENED
TO KILL YOURSELF

02:29.950 --> 02:31.652
BECAUSE YOUR GIRLFRIEND
KISSED SOMEONE ELSE.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.288
HOW ARE YOU AND DR. LAHIRI
DOING?

02:34.322 --> 02:35.889
YOU KNOW, I'M WORRIED
ABOUT THE TWO OF YOU.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.391
OH, NO, NO, THE ONLY THING
YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT

02:37.425 --> 02:39.860
IS THAT I MIGHT MURDER HER,
BUT OTHER THAN THAT--

02:39.893 --> 02:42.396
THAT WAS A JOKE.
I WAS JOKING.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.265
SHE'S BEEN LATE A LOT
RECENTLY.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.266
YOU KNOW WHAT,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.400
THANK YOU FOR THE BROCHURE.

02:46.434 --> 02:47.901
I'M GONNA TAKE A LOOK AT IT
RIGHT NOW.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.637
NO, DON'T TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
READ IT.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.372
I'M GONNA--YEAH,
I'M GONNA READ IT, OF COURSE.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.874
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
DR. FISHMAN.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.311
[knocking at the door]

02:57.345 --> 03:00.548
HEY, DR. "P."
YOU'RE MAD LONELY, RIGHT?

03:00.581 --> 03:02.416
OH, YEAH.
WHY?

03:02.450 --> 03:05.486
* I WANT TO SET YOU UP
I WANT TO SET YOU UP *

03:05.519 --> 03:06.487
* HEY!
* UP

03:06.520 --> 03:07.488
[laughter]

03:07.521 --> 03:08.289
WITH MY BEST FRIEND
ABBY.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.391
OH, COOL.
SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

03:10.424 --> 03:12.393
SHE'S BEEN LOOKING
FOR A STRONG-ASS MAN,

03:12.426 --> 03:13.794
BUT IS NOW LOWERING
HER STANDARDS,

03:13.827 --> 03:15.296
AND I THINK
YOU'D BE PERFECT.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.397
WE'RE LIKE TWINS.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.399
TWINS, HUH?
OKAY.

03:18.432 --> 03:22.436
I GOTTA HIT THE GYM, MAN,
STEAL ME SOME SOAP.

03:22.470 --> 03:23.804
YEAH!

03:26.540 --> 03:29.710
[laughter]

03:29.743 --> 03:30.711
EVENING.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.380
MY BOYFRIEND,
DANIEL CASTELLANO,

03:32.413 --> 03:34.282
MADE A RESERVATION
FOR "LAFFABOUTIT:"

03:34.315 --> 03:36.350
A NIGHT OF NEW YORK'S BEST
ITALIAN-AMERICAN COMEDY.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.885
UH-HUH.
OH, GREAT.

03:37.918 --> 03:41.422
MY MA'S COOKING'S SO BAD,
I BEG THE DOG FOR HIS SCRAPS.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.457
[laughter]

03:45.926 --> 03:49.663
OH, NO, LOOK, LOOK,
J.LO'S TEXTING DURING MY SET?

03:49.697 --> 03:52.300
HEY, J.LO, WHO YOU TEXTING,
"BEN AFFLECKS"?

03:52.333 --> 03:54.335
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!

03:54.368 --> 03:56.570
ACTUALLY, SIR,
JENNIFER LOPEZ AND BEN AFFLECK

03:56.604 --> 03:57.638
BROKE UP YEARS AGO.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.940
OH, WELL, GOOD FOR HER!

03:59.973 --> 04:01.675
[laughter]

04:01.709 --> 04:03.377
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE--

04:03.411 --> 04:04.412
[phone buzzing]

04:16.056 --> 04:18.292
WHAT COULD BE MORE COMPELLING
THAN MY SET?

04:18.326 --> 04:19.660
OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.829
OH, SHE'S FIGHTING
WITH HER BOYFRIEND, EVERYBODY!

04:21.862 --> 04:23.364
[audience oohs]
OKAY...

04:23.397 --> 04:26.700
OH, AND HE DITCHED HER
FOR BEING CHRONICALLY LATE.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.402
OH!

04:28.436 --> 04:29.503
MAYBE SHE SHOULD...

04:29.537 --> 04:31.805
TAKE A HIKE!
YEAH!

04:31.839 --> 04:33.641
(all)
TAKE A HIKE!

04:33.674 --> 04:36.410
TAKE A HIKE!
TAKE A HIKE!

04:36.444 --> 04:37.210
TAKE A HIKE!

04:37.244 --> 04:38.679
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:38.712 --> 04:41.349
I WILL LEAVE.
BUT I WILL NEVER HIKE.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.484
[thwack]
AHH!

04:43.517 --> 04:45.819
TAKE A HIKE!
TAKE A HIKE!

04:47.888 --> 04:48.922
HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.824
HAVE ANY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
OF COLOR CHECKED IN TONIGHT?

04:50.858 --> 04:52.092
MM-MMM.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.761
BLIND DATE, HUH?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.929
UH, YEAH.
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.798
[giggles]
WHAT'S YOUR DATE'S NAME?

04:57.831 --> 04:58.966
ABBY.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.534
MY NAME IS ABBY.

05:00.568 --> 05:03.003
OH, THE ABBY THAT I'M MEETING
IS ACTUALLY, LIKE,

05:03.036 --> 05:04.938
REALLY TALL, GORGEOUS,

05:04.972 --> 05:06.940
AND, FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD,
AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.842
OH.
WELL, I'M MEETING A DOCTOR

05:08.876 --> 05:10.411
WHO LOOKS LIKE MEATLOAF.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.545
OH.
OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

05:11.579 --> 05:12.946
"A MEATLOAF."
I'M NOT SURE.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.483
MY FRIEND TAMRA
WASN'T REALLY CLEAR.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.585
TAMRA, HUH?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.921
WELL, UH, WHAT DO YOU DO?

05:20.954 --> 05:23.056
OH, I WRITE HISTORICAL
ROMANCE NOVELS.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.958
OH, THAT'S COOL.
YEAH.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.994
I LOVE TO READ.
OH.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.530
WELL, YOU SHOULD GIVE
ROMANCE NOVELS A TRY.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.865
MM.
AND IT'S BASICALLY
PORNOGRAPHY

05:31.899 --> 05:33.701
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO READ
ON THE SUBWAY, SO--

05:33.734 --> 05:36.904
OH, DANG IT!
GETTING A TEXT.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.672
LOOKS LIKE A PATIENT'S
GOING INTO LABOR,

05:38.706 --> 05:40.040
AND THERE'S NO FATHER,

05:40.073 --> 05:42.910
SO THE TAXI CAB DRIVER
IS KIND OF THE SURROGATE NOW,

05:42.943 --> 05:44.077
SO I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD--

05:44.111 --> 05:45.979
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU DESCRIBING
LOOK WHO'S TALKING?

05:46.013 --> 05:46.980
OH, IT'S SIMILAR.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.016
THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T WANT
TO DATE ME, YOU KNOW?

05:49.049 --> 05:50.484
YEAH.
YEAH, IT'S GOOD TO MEET YOU.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.719
NICE TO MEET YOU.
YEAH.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.057
UNBELIEVABLE.
9:13.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.393
EVEN AFTER LAST NIGHT
YOU'RE STILL LATE?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.163
I'M GIVING YOU THE SILENT
TREATMENT, BY THE WAY.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.733
THAT'S WHY I WALKED RIGHT BY YOU
AND DIDN'T RESPOND.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.436
HEY, HEY, NO ONE
SILENT-TREATMENTS ME.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.870
OH, GOOD, GOOD,
EVERYONE'S IN HERE.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.139
I WAS WORRIED WE'D HAVE
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION FOR ONCE.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.174
YOU'RE WELCOME, DR. "Q."

06:14.207 --> 06:15.909
IS IT A CONVERSATION, DANNY?
'CAUSE IT FEELS

06:15.943 --> 06:17.745
A LOT MORE LIKE A LECTURE,
AND NOT THE GOOD KIND

06:17.778 --> 06:19.580
WHERE I END UP STALKING
THE PROFESSOR AT THE END.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.449
ALL I'M SAYING IS,
YOU'RE NEVER LATE FOR A DELIVERY

06:21.482 --> 06:23.083
OR A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY,
BUT A MOVIE?

06:23.116 --> 06:24.785
A MOVIE?
AND SUDDENLY,

06:24.818 --> 06:25.919
IT'S LIKE I ASKED YOU
TO CUT OFF YOUR ARM

06:25.953 --> 06:27.521
OR THROW AWAY YOUR
OWN TRASH.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.023
BECAUSE DELIVERING A BABY
INTO THIS WORLD IS AS IMPORTANT

06:30.057 --> 06:32.025
AS MEETING MY BOYFRIEND
FOR A STUPID MOVIE.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.695
YOU AND I DO THE SAME JOB.
I GET EVERYWHERE ON TIME.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.029
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU'RE A GUY.

06:36.063 --> 06:36.830
I CAN'T JUST DELIVER A BABY,

06:36.864 --> 06:38.198
THROW SOME TALC
ON MY PRIVATE PARTS,

06:38.231 --> 06:39.700
AND BE SOMEWHERE
THREE MINUTES LATER.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.868
I GOT TO SHOWER, MY FRIEND.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.970
I GOT TO SHAVE THIS HOT BODY
FROM MY ANKLES TO MY EYEBROWS.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.638
ALSO, I HAVE TO HIGHLIGHT
AND CONTOUR EVERYTHING

06:44.672 --> 06:45.939
JUST SO THAT YOU'LL
HAVE SEX WITH ME.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.040
I'M BASICALLY C.G.I.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.942
RIGHT, AND YOU'RE FORGETTING
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART,

06:48.976 --> 06:50.478
DR. "L," C.P.T.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.046
THANK YOU, TAMRA, THAT'S RIGHT.
COLORED PEOPLE TIME.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.047
WHOA, NO, NO, NO.
(all)
NO.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.449
WHAT, NO?
NO, NO, NO.

06:55.483 --> 06:58.652
I MEANT C.P.T.,
CARAMEL PRINCESS TIME.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.988
WHEN YOU'RE AS CUTE AS WE ARE,
PEOPLE WAIT FOR YOU.

07:01.021 --> 07:01.822
I WANT TO BELIEVE YOU.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.023
IT DOES SOUND LIKE
A HUGE LOAD OF CRAP.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.693
I'M NOT SAYING, "NO," I JUST
NEED YOU TO CONTINUE EXPLAINING.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.128
NO, THIS IS ALL NONSENSE, OKAY?
THERE'S NO C.P.T.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.564
YOU'RE EITHER ON TIME
OR YOU'RE LATE.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.099
OOH!
MAYBE IF YOU WERE LATE
JUST ONCE,

07:12.132 --> 07:13.901
YOU WOULD REALIZE
IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.969
OH, YEAH, WELL, THAT'S NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN, SWEETHEART.

07:16.003 --> 07:16.737
I'M NEVER GONNA BE LATE.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.839
[clicks tongue]
WATCH AND LEARN.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.741
HMM.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.742
(Tamra)
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU!

07:21.775 --> 07:22.743
(Peter)
OW--HEY!

07:22.776 --> 07:24.011
GET ON IN THERE WITH
YOUR STUPID MESSENGER BAG!

07:24.044 --> 07:25.513
HEY, TAKE IT EASY.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.748
SHAMEFUL. DUDE,
HOW COULD YOU DITCH ABBY, MAN?

07:27.781 --> 07:31.952
SHE'S THE COMPLETE PACKAGE:
HEAD, SHOULDERS, KNEES, TOES,

07:31.985 --> 07:33.921
KNEES AND TOES--
SHE'S GOT IT ALL.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.524
I'M SORRY, I WAS JUST
EXPECTING SOMEONE...

07:36.557 --> 07:38.091
WHO'S MORE OF A MATCH
PHYSICALLY.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.961
A MATCH PHYSICALLY?
YOU SAID TWINS.

07:40.994 --> 07:41.895
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
WHAT'D YOU THINK,

07:41.929 --> 07:43.864
NATALIE PORTMAN'S SITTING
IN HER CASTLE,

07:43.897 --> 07:46.166
LIKE, "OH, I WONDER IF THERE ARE
ANY SCHLUBS OUT THERE

07:46.199 --> 07:48.035
WHO WEAR A BATHING SUIT
AS UNDERWEAR?"

07:48.068 --> 07:49.803
NATALIE PORTMAN WOULD THROW UP
IF SHE SAW YOU.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.138
YOU NEED TO GO
APOLOGIZE TO ABBY.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.806
SHE'LL BE AT THE BOOK STORE
TOMORROW.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.842
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BE DOING,
EATING PRETZELS OFF THE FLOOR?

07:54.875 --> 07:55.876
YEAH, I SAW IT.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.645
FINE, I'LL GO!

07:57.678 --> 08:02.783
[snoring]

08:02.816 --> 08:04.685
[whispering]
PSST.
DANNY, ARE YOU AWAKE?

08:04.718 --> 08:06.219
[snoring]
HEY, DANNY,

08:06.253 --> 08:08.155
I THINK RUDY GIULIANI'S
A CLOWN.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.892
[snoring]

08:21.802 --> 08:23.837
GOOD NIGHT, SWEET PRINCE.
HONK!

08:23.871 --> 08:25.005
[snorts]

08:28.241 --> 08:30.043
HEY, MIN.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.211
HEY!
HEY.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.213
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU'RE UP EARLY, WOW.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.314
WHY DON'T YOU COME UPSTAIRS?

08:34.347 --> 08:35.916
MY LITTLE EARLY BIRD
CAN GET THE WORM.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.018
OH.
THAT'S A SUPER SEXY OFFER,

08:38.051 --> 08:39.587
BUT IT'S 8:40.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.988
AREN'T YOU WORRIED
ABOUT BEING LATE TO WORK?

08:41.021 --> 08:41.955
8:40?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:41.989 --> 08:43.290
YEAH.
NO, NO, IT'S 7:40.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.593
OH, REALLY?

08:46.960 --> 08:49.563
YOU TINKERED WITH MY DIGITAL.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

08:49.597 --> 08:51.231
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?
BETRAYAL!

08:51.264 --> 08:52.866
OH, BOO-HOO.
YOU KNOW WHAT BETRAYAL WAS?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.267
WHEN YOU DITCHED ME
AT THAT COMEDY CLUB.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.169
THAT GUY TOLD ME TO TAKE A HIKE.
THE AUDIENCE LOVED IT.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.871
NOW, HE WANTS ME TO GO
ON TOUR WITH HIM.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.107
DON'T WORRY, SWEETHEART.
I'LL JUST TELL EVERYONE AT WORK

09:00.140 --> 09:01.909
THAT YOU'RE RUNNING LATE.
BYE, MY LOVE.

09:01.942 --> 09:02.943
STEP ON IT!

09:02.976 --> 09:03.944
OPEN THE DOOR.
TAKE OFF, TAKE OFF.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.979
OPEN--
DON'T TAKE OFF.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.881
TAXI! TAXI!

09:07.915 --> 09:09.850
I'M NOT GONNA BE LATE.
I'M NOT--

09:12.019 --> 09:13.954
SO I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
TO A GIRL,

09:13.987 --> 09:15.689
WHICH IS SOMETHING I'VE
LITERALLY NEVER DONE BEFORE.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.057
MM-HMM.
IS DANNY IN?

09:20.293 --> 09:22.129
OH, DANNY.
DANNY IS NOT IN,

09:22.162 --> 09:23.864
BECAUSE EVERYONE,
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.233
DANNY CASTELLANO
WILL BE LATE.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.101
I MADE IT!
I MADE IT!

09:28.135 --> 09:30.671
DANNY CASTELLANO IS ON TIME!

09:30.704 --> 09:32.640
WHAT--
8:59, I MADE IT!

09:32.673 --> 09:33.941
IN YOUR FACE, LAHIRI!

09:33.974 --> 09:35.075
HONK!
AH!

09:35.108 --> 09:36.076
CAN'T MAKE ME LATE.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.778
TAKE A HIKE.
BOOM!

09:37.811 --> 09:39.747
OH!
TAKE ANOTHER ONE, BOOM!

09:39.780 --> 09:40.781
BOOM, BOOM!
OH!

09:40.814 --> 09:42.015
TAKE A HIKE.
BOOM!

09:42.049 --> 09:44.184
MORGAN, TAKE A HIKE.
BOOM! BOOM!

09:44.217 --> 09:48.155
MICHAEL JACKSON!
OHH!

09:48.188 --> 09:50.023
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!

09:51.892 --> 09:53.827
DR. FISHMAN.
[snaps fingers]

09:53.861 --> 09:55.996
GO TALK IN MY OFFICE?
YEAH, LET'S TALK IN MY OFFICE.

09:57.397 --> 10:00.367
YOUR EMOTIONAL ISSUES
ARE OUT OF CONTROL,

10:00.400 --> 10:03.637
AND I INSIST THAT YOU TAKE THAT
MENTAL HEALTH SEMINAR TOMORROW.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.973
OKAY, AS MUCH AS I DON'T
WANT TO, I ALSO CAN'T.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.308
SATURDAYS, THAT'S WHEN I TAKE
MY MA TO RUN ALL HER ERRANDS.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.409
WELL, HERE'S THE THING.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.345
UNTIL YOU COMPLETE THE SEMINAR,
YOU ARE SUSPENDED

10:12.379 --> 10:14.748
FROM SEEING PATIENTS
IN MY HOSPITAL.

10:14.782 --> 10:15.916
GET INTO THAT.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.951
[sighs]
I'D RATHER NOT GET INTO THAT.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.820
WELL, TAKE THE COURSE
AT YOUR LEISURE,

10:19.853 --> 10:23.256
WHENEVER YOU FIND TIME TO FIT IT
INTO YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.759
HMM? IT TAKES PLACE
IN THIS BUILDING.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.361
IN THIS BUILDING?
WHO ADMINISTERS THE COURSE?

10:28.395 --> 10:33.000
ONLY THE MOST KIND, DYNAMIC,
SPIRITUAL MAN I KNOW.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.935
OH, NO.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.204
I'VE LONGED FOR THIS DAY,
DANIEL,

10:37.237 --> 10:39.306
THE DAY I CAN FINALLY
FIX YOU.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.043
(Mindy)
HEY, BABE.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.211
YOU.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.113
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT YOU.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.380
DESLAURIER HUGGED ME
ON THE WAY OUT,

10:47.414 --> 10:49.316
AND I ACCIDENTALLY
KISSED HIM ON THE EAR.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.918
OH, GOD.
DANNY, I'M SO SORRY.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.285
THIS CAN'T BE WORSE
THAN THE TIME

10:52.319 --> 10:54.121
THAT I SHREDDED YOUR PASSPORT
FOR CONFETTI, IS IT?

10:54.154 --> 10:56.289
OH, YEAH, IT'S MUCH WORSE, OKAY?

10:56.323 --> 10:58.425
I'M SUPPOSED TO TAKE MA TO ALL
HER APPOINTMENTS ON SATURDAY.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.860
WITHOUT ME, SHE WON'T GO.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.829
A PARENT OF DIVORCE NEEDS
ROUTINE, MINDY,

11:01.862 --> 11:02.863
THEY NEED ROUTINE.
I KNOW.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.732
[sighs]
WELL...

11:04.765 --> 11:05.966
YOU WERE JUST
RUNNING ERRANDS

11:05.999 --> 11:07.334
AND SHE WAS GONNA GET
HER HAIR DONE, RIGHT?

11:07.367 --> 11:09.002
YEAH.
I COULD TAKE HER.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.871
I LOVE BEAUTY SHOPS.
PLEASE.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.006
PLEASE LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU,
DANNY, I FEEL SO BAD.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.742
YOU LITERALLY HAVE
NO OTHER OPTIONS.

11:16.810 --> 11:17.811
(Peter)
WHOA.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.446
WHAT, IS THE DUDE THAT WROTE
HARRY POTTER HERE?

11:19.479 --> 11:21.749
NO.
WE'RE HERE FOR ABBY BERMAN.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.085
BERMAN.

11:25.118 --> 11:28.355
(Abby's voice)
"SAVANNAH UNBUTTONED EDMUND'S
UNIFORM TROUSERS.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.723
"'EDMUND LAROUGE!

11:29.757 --> 11:34.161
'I DO BELIEVE WE CAN TAKE
MARYLAND WITH THIS SABER.'"

11:34.194 --> 11:35.796
THIS IS GOOD.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.464
"'HE DON'T DESERVE A BURIAL.

11:37.497 --> 11:40.100
"HE'S A YANKEE,'
SAVANNAH HISSED.

11:40.133 --> 11:43.503
"EDMUND SHOOK HIS HEAD.
'HE MAY HAVE BEEN A YANKEE,

11:43.536 --> 11:45.773
BUT HE WAS STILL A MAN.'"

11:45.806 --> 11:47.975
DAMN.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.877
HEY, YOU GONNA BUY THAT?

11:49.910 --> 11:51.845
OH, ABBY,
YOUR BOOK IS SO GOOD.

11:51.879 --> 11:52.645
YEAH, I KNOW.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.181
DID YOU COME HERE
TO TELL ME THAT?

11:54.214 --> 11:56.349
ACTUALLY, I-I CAME HERE
TO APOLOGIZE,

11:56.383 --> 11:58.819
BUT I'VE BEEN READING YOUR BOOK,
AND YOU HAVE ALL THESE FANS,

11:58.852 --> 12:01.288
AND I DON'T WANT TO APOLOGIZE.
I'D LIKE TO GO OUT AGAIN.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.957
YOU DITCHED ME BECAUSE YOU
DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY I LOOKED.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.793
[women gasp]
I KNOW.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.294
[stammers]
LISTEN,

12:07.327 --> 12:08.428
YOU'RE A JERK.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.197
YEAH.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.232
YEAH, NO, YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.038
PAUL?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.239
HEY.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.774
HOW'D YOU GET
DRAGGED OUT OF

12:20.808 --> 12:22.275
THE BLOOD LAB FOR THIS?

12:22.309 --> 12:23.977
I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN I FIGURE IT OUT.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.246
NOWADAYS, YOU FART TOO LOUD
AND YOU GOT TO GO TO COUNSELING.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.148
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT,
BROTHER.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.819
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
OH, DANIEL.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.087
LET'S GET STARTED.

12:34.121 --> 12:37.124
THANK YOU, WELCOME,
AND OF COURSE, NAMASTE.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.826
I AM OVERJOYED
THAT YOU'VE DECIDED

12:38.859 --> 12:40.393
TO SHARE YOUR TIME
WITH ME TODAY.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.963
OH, I DIDN'T REALIZE
WE HAD A CHOICE.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.531
WELL, WE ALWAYS HAVE
A CHOICE, DANIEL.

12:44.564 --> 12:45.298
DOES THAT FOLLOW?

12:45.332 --> 12:47.935
YEAH, DANNY,
DOES THAT FOLLOW?

12:47.968 --> 12:50.838
THAT'S HUMOROUS, GENTLEMEN.
PAUL, WOULD YOU CARE TO SHARE

12:50.871 --> 12:53.240
THE CHOICE THAT RESULTED
IN YOUR ATTENDANCE HERE TODAY?

12:53.273 --> 12:54.541
YEAH, I GOT NOTHING TO HIDE.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.309
I'VE BEEN STEALING BLOOD
FROM THE HOSPITAL

12:56.343 --> 12:57.544
FOR MY OWN PERSONAL USE.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.578
WAIT, WHAT?

12:58.611 --> 13:00.213
OKAY, YOU THINK THAT'S BAD?

13:00.247 --> 13:02.415
MY FEMALE BOSS
IS IN LOVE WITH ME.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.284
OH, MORGAN, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:04.317 --> 13:06.486
ALSO, I'M ADDICTED
TO COOKIES.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.320
MY NAME'S MORGAN.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.456
DANIEL, ARE YOU FEELING
SAFE ENOUGH

13:09.489 --> 13:10.924
TO SHARE WHY YOU'RE HERE TODAY?

13:10.958 --> 13:12.292
WAIT, WHAT?
NO.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.526
NO, I'M NOT FEELING
SAFE ENOUGH.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.362
DON'T LUMP ME IN
WITH THESE FREAKS, OKAY?

13:15.395 --> 13:16.964
I'M A NORMAL.
PASS.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.266
WELL, YOU'RE FREE TO GO
ANYTIME.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.600
I WON'T STAND IN YOUR WAY.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.169
ALL RIGHT,
SEE YOU LATER, PAUL.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.971
I AM, HOWEVER, GOING TO
GIVE YOU AN INCOMPLETE

13:24.004 --> 13:26.106
AND RECOMMEND
FURTHER MENTAL EVALUATION.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.875
OH, YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.476
NAMASTE.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.511
(Mindy)
HEY, ANNETTE, YOU NEED
ANY HELP IN THERE?

13:31.544 --> 13:34.247
HELP?
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM?

13:34.281 --> 13:36.249
WE'RE NOT THAT DIFFERENT
IN AGE, YOU KNOW.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.485
UM, YOU ARE THE OLDEST PERSON
I KNOW'S MOTHER,

13:38.518 --> 13:39.920
SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUE.
OKAY.

13:39.953 --> 13:43.023
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW,
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.892
AH, HELLO, DOT.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.493
IT'S SO NICE THAT YOU CAN
JOIN US ON OUR ERRANDS.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.529
I COULD DRIVE US IF THEY HADN'T
TAKEN MY LICENSE AWAY.

13:49.562 --> 13:52.565
I RAN OVER MY NEIGHBOR'S
BASSET HOUND, BIG WHOOP.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.167
CALL ME WHEN IT'S A PERSON.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.535
OKAY, WELL--

13:55.568 --> 13:57.304
GOD, I DON'T KNOW WHY DANNY
GAVE US AN HOUR

13:57.337 --> 13:59.372
TO GET TO THE HAIR SALON.
IT'S ONLY FIVE MINUTES AWAY.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.042
[gasps]
OH, MY GOODNESS!

14:02.075 --> 14:04.611
DOT, WILL YOU LOOK AT US!
TWINS!

14:04.644 --> 14:06.013
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD,
OH, MY GOD!

14:06.046 --> 14:07.881
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
OF THAT HAPPENING?

14:07.915 --> 14:09.482
YES, THAT IS REMARKABLE.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.483
HEY, WE SHOULD HEAD OUT.
COME ON.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.185
OH, NO, MINDY,
TAKE A PICTURE.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.253
OH, YEAH!
YOU GOT TO CAPTURE THIS

14:13.286 --> 14:14.487
AND EMAIL IT TO ME,

14:14.521 --> 14:16.556
AND THEN PRINT OUT THE EMAIL
AND HAND IT TO ME.

14:16.589 --> 14:17.991
YEAH.
YEAH, LET'S DO IT, OKAY.

14:18.025 --> 14:18.992
READY.

14:19.026 --> 14:19.993
ONE, TWO, THREE.

14:20.027 --> 14:20.994
(both)
CHEESE!

14:21.028 --> 14:22.595
GOT IT.
LET'S GO, COME ON, GUYS.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.931
OH, NO, I GOT TO GO CHANGE.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.198
[both murmuring]

14:25.232 --> 14:27.100
WHA--OH,
YOU'RE GONNA CHANCE, OKAY.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.939
PLEASE LOOK
INTO YOUR PARTNER'S EYES

14:31.972 --> 14:33.941
AND REPEAT AFTER ME.
"I SUPPORT YOU."

14:33.974 --> 14:35.442
I SUPPORT YOU.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.444
NO WAY.
BRENDAN,
HE'S NOT DOING IT.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.079
DANIEL, I'VE GIVEN YOU
A PASS SO FAR,

14:39.112 --> 14:40.547
BUT YOUR PARTICIPATION
IS NOW REQUIRED

14:40.580 --> 14:41.949
FOR THE CLASS TO CONTINUE.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.384
FINE, WHATEVER.
I SUPPORT HIM.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.252
THINK I'M CURED.

14:45.285 --> 14:48.621
OKAY, NOW,
"I LOVE AND CARE FOR YOU."

14:48.655 --> 14:50.557
I WANT TO MAKE LOVE
AND CARE FOR YOU.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.959
OKAY, COME ON!

14:51.992 --> 14:52.926
BRENDAN,
HE'S NOT HELPING ME.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.661
YOU WANT TO SWITCH PARTNERS?
MY LADY HATES ME.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.496
NO.
LOOK...

14:56.529 --> 14:57.664
[sighs]

14:57.697 --> 14:59.066
I LOVE AND CARE FOR YOU.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.234
THANK YOU.
I FELT NOTHING.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.536
BECAUSE I DIDN'T MEAN IT, OKAY?
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.272
YOU'RE WEIRD, OKAY?
YOU'RE WEIRD, MORGAN.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.607
THE WHOLE THING IS WEIRD.
YOU WANNA STOP ACTING CRAZY?

15:07.640 --> 15:10.077
EAT LEAN PROTEIN
AND EXERCISE TEN TIMES A WEEK

15:10.110 --> 15:11.511
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON!

15:11.544 --> 15:14.247
OKAY, I CAN SEE NOW
THAT THIS SORT OF GROUP THERAPY

15:14.281 --> 15:17.550
IS TOO BASIC FOR SOMEONE
AS CLOSED-OFF AS YOU.

15:17.584 --> 15:21.955
I'M GONNA WORK ON YOU NOW,
ONE-ON-ONE.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.523
(Mindy)
ALL RIGHT,
YOU GOT YOUR HAIR DONE.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.293
IT'S MAMMOGRAM TIME,
EVEN THOUGH WE ARE AN HOUR LATE.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.560
[sighs]
COME ON, COME ON.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.495
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW I FEEL

15:28.528 --> 15:30.397
ABOUT THIS HAIRSTYLE
THAT YOU MADE ME GET.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.433
THIS IS THE ONLY TIME
YOU EVER LOOKED PRETTY.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.102
MINDY, YOU'RE LATE.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.436
[whispering]
I CAN'T SEE HER.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.972
CAROLYN, I AM SO SORRY,
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.573
IT TOOK THEM FOREVER
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.508
THEN WE WENT TO THE HAIR SALON.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.676
THEY MADE ME GET
THIS DIXIE CARTER HAIRSTYLE.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.179
THE POINT IS, THIS WOMAN
NEEDS TO GET A MAMMOGRAM.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.048
I PROMISED MY BOYFRIEND.
PLEASE.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.483
I'D LOVE TO, BUT I'M ON MY WAY
TO CARDIO BARRE.

15:50.517 --> 15:51.985
ARE YOU KIDDING ME WITH THIS,
CAROLYN?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.720
I PICKED YOU UP OFF THE FLOOR
OF THAT CONFERENCE

15:53.753 --> 15:55.155
AFTER YOU HAD
A THOUSAND MARGARITAS.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.023
[whispering]
YOU ARE NOT GONNA

15:56.056 --> 15:57.357
PLAY THAT CARD!
I WILL PLAY THAT CARD.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.459
OH, MY GOD.
FINE, I'LL DO IT.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.560
THANK YOU.

16:00.593 --> 16:04.464
HEY, HOW'S DR. PRENTICE?
HE NEVER CALLED.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.433
PETER?
OH, GOD.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.601
OKAY, WELL, YOU DODGED A BULLET
WITH THAT ONE.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.769
THANK YOU.
I'M SORRY THAT I HAD TO

16:09.802 --> 16:11.671
BLACKMAIL YOU.
WHATEVER.

16:11.704 --> 16:16.109
WELL, YOU JUST WITNESSED
THE CLASSIC MINDY LAHIRI CHARM.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.610
THAT'S HOW I GOT
MY FRESHMAN YEAR R.A.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.047
TO KISS ME, EVEN THOUGH
HE WAS GAY, SO--

16:20.080 --> 16:22.749
WELL, WE'VE JUST BEEN TALKING,
AND I DON'T WANT TO GO ANYMORE.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.584
IT'S TOO LATE
AND I'M TOO TIRED.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.253
EXCUSE ME?

16:26.286 --> 16:28.188
I HEARD THAT MAMMOGRAM MACHINES
ACTUALLY GIVE YOU CANCER.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.456
[gasps]
OH!

16:29.489 --> 16:30.690
THAT'S RIGHT,
I THINK JENNY MCCARTHY

16:30.723 --> 16:31.591
SAID THAT ON THE VIEW.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.560
OH, WELL, THERE YOU GO.
WHY WOULD SHE SAY

16:33.593 --> 16:35.128
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IF IT WASN'T TRUE?

16:35.162 --> 16:36.396
HEY, I'M GONNA
KILL YOU GUYS.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.231
I'M SERIOUS.
YOU TWO BOZOS

16:38.265 --> 16:40.600
ARE THE MOST INCONSIDERATE
PEOPLE THAT I HAVE EVER MET!

16:40.633 --> 16:42.202
YOU'RE LATE FOR EVERYTHING,

16:42.235 --> 16:44.304
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANYBODY'S TIME BUT YOUR OWN.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.340
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I SIMPLY CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.475
IT IS APPALLING.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.509
NO WONDER DANNY IS
SUCH A TIGHT-ASS.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.677
[gasps]
OKAY,

16:50.710 --> 16:52.345
YOU'RE GONNA GO WITH ME.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.546
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:53.580 --> 16:54.781
HEY, LOOK AT ME!
YOU'RE GONNA GO IN THERE,

16:54.814 --> 16:56.116
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
YOUR SHIRT OFF,

16:56.149 --> 16:58.151
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR MAMMOGRAM!

16:58.185 --> 16:59.452
WE'RE READY TO GO.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.156
[sobs]

17:03.190 --> 17:06.159
[both sob]

17:08.495 --> 17:09.462
SO YOUR PARTICULAR EPISODE

17:09.496 --> 17:10.730
WAS THE RESULT OF A FIGHT

17:10.763 --> 17:13.200
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND,
WHO--FULL DISCLOSURE, CLASS--

17:13.233 --> 17:14.834
I'VE MADE LOVE TO
ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.436
WHY DID THAT NEED
TO BE SAID?

17:16.469 --> 17:19.439
AND THE FIGHT STARTED SIMPLY
BECAUSE SHE WAS LATE TO...

17:19.472 --> 17:21.841
WHICH PARTICULAR ETHNIC
EXPLOITATION FILM?

17:21.874 --> 17:24.211
THE GODFATHER: PART II.
RIGHT, WELL,

17:24.244 --> 17:25.778
IF IT'S NOT SWEDISH,
I'M NOT TOO FAMILIAR WITH IT.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.547
BUT, WHO CARES?
SHE'S LATE,

17:27.580 --> 17:29.216
AND YOU MISS THE FILM.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

17:29.249 --> 17:30.417
IT'S JUST PRINCIPLE.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.385
IF YOU'RE LATE,
IT'S DISRESPECTFUL.

17:32.419 --> 17:33.386
I DON'T BUY IT.
WHY DID THIS

17:33.420 --> 17:36.456
PARTICULAR INFRACTION
LEAD YOU TO LASH OUT?

17:36.489 --> 17:37.390
[sighs]
OH, COME ON, DESLAURIER,

17:37.424 --> 17:39.559
I WAS JUST MAD.
WELL, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

17:39.592 --> 17:40.427
WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

17:40.460 --> 17:41.761
MY TIME IS WASTED, OKAY?

17:41.794 --> 17:43.096
I'M SITTING OUT THERE
IN THE COLD,

17:43.130 --> 17:44.397
I'M EMBARRASSED.
I FEEL FOOLISH.

17:44.431 --> 17:45.698
I DON'T BUY IT.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.567
WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

17:50.403 --> 17:52.672
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE SHE
DOESN'T SHOW UP AT ALL.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.842
WHY WOULD SHE NOT SHOW UP?

17:55.875 --> 17:57.844
BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENED
BEFORE.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.146
KEEP GOING.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.348
[scoffs]
FINE, I--

18:01.381 --> 18:05.552
MAYBE I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO SEE
THE GHOSTBUSTE WITH MY DAD.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.188
HE TOLD ME HE WAS GONNA TAKE ME,
AND MAYBE I JUST SAT ON MY PORCH

18:08.221 --> 18:09.589
AND I WAITED FOR HIM
ALL NIGHT LONG

18:09.622 --> 18:11.724
AND HE NEVER SHOWED UP.
AND MAYBE

18:11.758 --> 18:13.526
I WALKED TO THE THEATER
BY MYSELF

18:13.560 --> 18:17.397
AND THE ONLY TICKETS
THEY HAD LEFT WAS AMADEUS.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.365
MM.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.667
I WAS SUPPOSED TO SEE EGON
AND SLIMER AND RAY,

18:20.700 --> 18:23.336
AND INSTEAD, I'M LOOKING
AT F. MURRAY ABRAHAM'S FACE.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.172
NO KID SHOULD HAVE TO LOOK
AT THAT THING CLOSE UP.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.574
I MEAN, IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE,
IF YOU REALLY LOVE SOMEONE,

18:27.607 --> 18:30.577
WHY WOULD YOU KEEP 'EM WAITING?
WHY WOULD YOU KEEP 'EM WAITING!

18:37.917 --> 18:39.619
OKAY, I THINK THERE'S MORE.
KEEP GOING.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.488
NO, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S BEDROCK.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.223
NO, TELL ME ABOUT THE PRIEST.
THERE HAS TO BE A PRIEST.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.291
WHAT PRIEST?
[phone buzzing]

18:44.324 --> 18:47.327
I THINK MY PROBLEM IS,
I LIKE STEALING THE BLOOD.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.328
OKAY, NOT NOW, PAUL.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.263
OKAY, THIS IS MA,
I GOTTA GO.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.599
OH, THE PRIEST AND A MOTHER.
WE HAVE HIT PAY DIRT.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.368
SAVE THAT FOR NEXT SESSION,
BUT FOR NOW, I AM PROUD OF YOU.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.238
(Abby)
HOPE, FAITH, AND...

18:59.706 --> 19:01.174
PETER, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

19:01.208 --> 19:02.575
HELLO.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.577
I'VE WRITTEN A STORY
I'D LIKE TO READ TO YOU ALL.

19:04.611 --> 19:08.415
IT'S CALLED A TITANIC MISTAKE:
A SUNKEN ROMANCE.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.916
CAN YOU GUESS
WHERE IT TAKES PLACE?

19:09.949 --> 19:10.917
THE TITANIC?

19:10.950 --> 19:12.419
IT'S ON THE TITANIC.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.787
"CHAPTER ONE.
DR. PETER PRENTICE WAS

19:14.821 --> 19:18.425
"AN EXPERT IN MEDICINE
BUT A NOVICE IN LOVE...

19:18.458 --> 19:20.827
UNTIL HE MET ABBY."
ARE YOU HOOKED?

19:20.860 --> 19:22.929
UM, JUST KEEP READING.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.265
OKAY.

19:25.298 --> 19:28.468
"THE OLD CAPTAIN SAID,
'ARR, HAVE YA EVER HEARD

19:28.501 --> 19:30.637
"'THAT WOMEN ARE LIKE
THAT ICEBERG OVER THERE?

19:30.670 --> 19:33.206
"'THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
IS UNDER THE SURFACE.'

19:33.240 --> 19:36.309
"PETER REPLIED, STUPIDLY:
'I SAY IGNORE IT.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.445
'WE'LL BE FINE.
CRASH!"

19:38.478 --> 19:40.247
THAT'S NOT
HISTORICALLY ACCURATE.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.349
HEY, I'M SORRY,
WERE YOU THERE, JOHN WATERS?

19:42.382 --> 19:44.251
MAYBE JUST SKIP FORWARD
A LITTLE BIT.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.685
[whispering]
I'M SORRY.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.588
AND PROPELLED BY LOVE
AND THE DOLPHIN

19:48.621 --> 19:51.258
SET UP IN CHAPTER THREE--
YOU REMEMBER THE DOLPHIN?

19:51.291 --> 19:52.759
YOU REMEMBER
WHEN I SET UP THE DOLPHIN--

19:52.792 --> 19:55.628
"THEY SWAM TO SAFETY.
THE END."

19:55.662 --> 19:57.464
WELL, THAT WAS TERRIBLE.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.967
BUT I-I KIND OF LIKED IT.

20:01.000 --> 20:01.968
YEAH?

20:02.001 --> 20:03.503
YEAH.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.771
YOU WANT TO GO OUT
ON ANOTHER DATE?

20:04.804 --> 20:06.506
OKAY, SURE.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.707
GREAT.

20:07.740 --> 20:08.775
YOU KNOW,
THIS WAS KIND OF FUN.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.343
I THINK I'LL COME BACK
NEXT WEEK.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.312
OH, NO.
YOU CAN NEVER RETURN.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.780
OKAY, NO PROBLEM.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.682
BYE, NEW FRIENDS.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.650
YOU THINK YOU OUTSMARTED ME?

20:17.684 --> 20:19.452
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

20:19.486 --> 20:21.821
HEY.
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

20:21.854 --> 20:23.523
I'VE BEEN LOCKED OUT.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.692
THE OLD CASTELLANO LOCK-OUT,
HUH?

20:25.725 --> 20:29.796
YEAH, I SPENT A LOT OF NIGHTS
ON THIS PORCH.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.931
HEY,
I NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.733
YOU'RE NOT SOME CRUSTY
OLD TYRANT

20:33.766 --> 20:34.967
WHO ENJOYS YELLING AT ME.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.569
YOU HAVE TO BE THIS WAY,
BECAUSE YOU WERE RAISED

20:36.603 --> 20:38.371
BY A BUNCH OF THOUGHTLESS
SPAGHETTI-HEADS--

20:38.405 --> 20:39.572
SHH.
WHO HAVE NO CONSIDERATION

20:39.606 --> 20:40.473
FOR ANYONE ELSE'S TIME.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.341
[whispering]
DON'T SAY "SPAGHETTI-HEAD."

20:41.374 --> 20:43.343
I'M SORRY I CALLED THEM
SPAGHETTI-HEADS.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.744
I HEARD SOMEONE SAY IT
ON A "NICK AT NIGHT" SHOW.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.313
IS IT OFFENSIVE?
YES, IT IS,

20:46.346 --> 20:48.548
BUT I-I-I APPRECIATE IT.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.816
OKAY.

20:49.849 --> 20:53.753
I ALSO--I THINK I...
I SOMETIMES--

20:53.786 --> 20:57.390
I OVERREACT
TO YOU BEING LATE.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.526
BECAUSE OF SOME STUFF
WITH MY DAD.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.895
OH.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.698
I WOULD LIKE TO PRESS FURTHER
FOR DETAILS, BUT I WON'T.

21:05.732 --> 21:06.833
THANK YOU.

21:06.866 --> 21:10.403
ANYWAY, I'M VERY SORRY,
AND I WILL NEVER BE LATE AGAIN.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.038
I MEAN, I'M GONNA
REALLY TRY NOT TO BE.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.706
COME HERE.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.844
I LIKE YOU
ON A STATEN ISLAND PORCH.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.547
I WOULD RATHER DIE.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.015
WE NEED TO GO INSIDE.
I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOUR MOM,

21:23.049 --> 21:25.718
AND DOT, FOR SOME REASON.
OKAY.

21:25.752 --> 21:28.621
I'M REALLY LIKING THAT HAIR.
IT'S DOING IT FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

21:28.655 --> 21:29.722
YOU LOOK LIKE MY AUNT.

21:29.756 --> 21:30.923
WHAT?

21:30.957 --> 21:32.759
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU SPAGHETTI-HEADS?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.794
(Danny)
STOP SAYING "SPAGHETTI-HEADS."
