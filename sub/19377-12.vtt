00:17.184 --> 00:19.353
<i>This is your final warning.</i>

00:19.937 --> 00:21.146
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

00:21.438 --> 00:23.523
<i>Evacuate Japan.</i>

00:23.607 --> 00:25.484
Is that a poison gas missile?

00:25.567 --> 00:28.403
<i>The government has ordered citizens</i>
<i>to seek shelter indoors</i>

00:28.487 --> 00:30.906
<i>but disorder continues</i>
<i>all over the country!</i>

00:30.989 --> 00:31.907
What are you doing?!

00:31.990 --> 00:36.578
-At this rate, it really will be war.
-Whatever do you mean, Tanaka?

00:36.662 --> 00:40.165
Haven't I been saying it from the start?
This is war.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.627
Sato's gone completely nuts.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.212
But what'll we do now?

00:45.295 --> 00:46.922
I have an idea about that.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.590
Nagai!

00:49.800 --> 00:51.051
Why did you come back?

00:51.134 --> 00:52.552
It should be obvious.

00:52.636 --> 00:56.056
You need my help to stop Sato.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.349
Don't make me laugh!

00:57.432 --> 00:59.101
Just what can you do for us now?!

00:59.184 --> 01:04.773
I know that you don't trust me,
and I don't care.

01:05.857 --> 01:06.692
But...

01:09.069 --> 01:10.654
I'm going to stop Sato

01:11.613 --> 01:13.282
because that's what I should do.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.285
-Nagai.
-You...

01:23.750 --> 01:24.960
<i>There's been an explosion!</i>

01:25.043 --> 01:28.672
<i>It seems to have gone off within the SDF</i>
<i>base that the Ajin Sato is occupying.</i>

01:28.755 --> 01:30.674
<i>The explosion happened without warning.</i>

01:30.757 --> 01:32.884
They're really making a scene.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.307
UNKNOWN CALLER

01:39.182 --> 01:40.058
Go ahead.

01:41.727 --> 01:42.769
We need to talk.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.283
<i>Open your eyes</i>
<i>This destiny</i>

01:56.491 --> 01:59.536
<i>If I can't escape it</i>

01:59.620 --> 02:01.288
<i>Then I'll swallow it all down</i>

02:01.371 --> 02:05.667
<i>Both right and wrong</i>
<i>And I'll fight</i>

02:05.751 --> 02:07.044
AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

02:12.257 --> 02:15.218
<i>The menace that dominates</i>

02:15.302 --> 02:18.347
<i>The darkness in my troubled mind</i>

02:18.430 --> 02:21.516
<i>The truth of a human</i>

02:21.600 --> 02:24.519
<i>Who has begun to lose control</i>

02:24.603 --> 02:26.938
<i>That meaninglessness</i>

02:27.022 --> 02:30.359
<i>I've come to know it</i>

02:30.817 --> 02:33.236
<i>If even counterfeit peace</i>

02:33.445 --> 02:36.948
<i>Will break into pieces</i>

02:37.032 --> 02:41.453
<i>I will cast</i>

02:41.578 --> 02:48.335
<i>A defiant shadow</i>

02:49.169 --> 02:52.172
<i>It's the end of escape</i>
<i>Stand up</i>

02:52.255 --> 02:55.300
<i>Because it's the only way</i>

02:55.384 --> 03:01.473
<i>Follow it</i>
<i>The small hope I aim for</i>

03:01.556 --> 03:04.559
<i>The weakness that spilled</i>
<i>From the proffered hand</i>

03:04.643 --> 03:07.813
<i>I swallowed it all down</i>

03:07.896 --> 03:14.403
<i>Both right and wrong</i>
<i>And lost my mind</i>

03:18.240 --> 03:22.327
BUT THAT MAKES IT INTERESTING,
SO WHATEVER

03:35.424 --> 03:36.967
Recovery operations complete.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.094
-Proceed with search operations.
-Copy that.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.140
Capture the targets at all costs.

03:43.932 --> 03:48.019
We're going to show them what they get
for humiliating us.

03:51.606 --> 03:56.153
They really hate being made
to look foolish.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.989
Now they'll stop playing around.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.244
Oh, Tanaka, this is going to be great.

04:05.787 --> 04:09.791
You're the only person who would say that
after humiliating the American military.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.964
But we lost that killer gas.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.716
Won't that hurt us?

04:18.091 --> 04:22.304
Well, it's no fun killing a bunch of
defenseless folks with poison gas, is it?

04:24.347 --> 04:27.809
No point in killing anyone
who isn't coming to kill us.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.070
This is the search team.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.114
<i>We've found Sato's escape route.</i>

04:41.531 --> 04:42.991
We'll send backup immediately.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.912
Colonel, it's the Pentagon.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.289
Yes.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.334
Yes, we've secured all of them.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.877
Search operations are underway.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.800
What? But, no, if we do that.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.972
All right. Understood.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.395
What happened?

05:16.399 --> 05:18.026
Get me the prime minister's office.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.954
In other words, we're going to take
the nerve gas that was recovered

05:29.037 --> 05:31.456
and disperse it underground,
thus disabling Sato?

05:31.540 --> 05:34.668
It's been decided that that is
the only way to capture Sato

05:34.751 --> 05:36.586
and regain control of the situation.

05:37.254 --> 05:41.675
But that plan would require significant
time for civilian evacuation

05:41.758 --> 05:43.343
and in that time he may escape.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.261
Well...

05:48.265 --> 05:53.979
We can't evacuate the civilians,
or Sato will realize what we're doing.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.565
So they're just collateral damage?!

05:56.648 --> 05:59.192
It will be treated as a terrorist attack
from Sato.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.902
He will be blamed for--

06:01.820 --> 06:03.196
I'm not asking how we spin it!

06:03.280 --> 06:05.532
How could you think so little
of our citizens?!

06:06.491 --> 06:10.287
The U.S. military is really the one
in charge now.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.081
We don't have the ability to stop them...

06:13.582 --> 06:15.041
Unbelievable.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.264
The operation begins in seven hours.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.726
The gas won't be dispersed
if we can catch Sato before then.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.855
That is the only way we can win now.

06:37.272 --> 06:40.984
-But still--
-I told you this is what would happen

06:41.067 --> 06:44.195
if the Commission left Sato
in the wild like this.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.547
Here again, huh?

07:15.560 --> 07:17.228
No need to be on guard.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.564
This isn't a trap.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.069
Why did you contact us?

07:25.028 --> 07:27.948
You stood up to Sato twice, and lived.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.159
We've decided you're the only one
who can stop him.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.372
And we want to help you do just that.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.584
And in return?

07:42.087 --> 07:46.049
Sato isn't the type to let traitors live.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.887
And there are only three of you?

07:51.346 --> 07:54.099
There were more of you
at Musashi Industries, weren't there?

07:54.683 --> 07:55.642
They all split.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.645
Said we were crazy to take on Sato.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.440
I don't disagree with them.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.567
Tanaka, too?

08:04.651 --> 08:09.864
-No, Tanaka is...
-He stayed behind with Sato, didn't he?

08:09.948 --> 08:11.950
So what if he did?

08:12.367 --> 08:16.204
If you wanna stop Sato,
you're gonna have to work with us.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.457
Tanaka warned us this kid
was a pain in the ass.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.334
You all should shut your mouths.

08:21.668 --> 08:25.171
As if we'd simply start trusting
a bunch of terrorist filth like you.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.008
You shut up, you bastard!

08:28.091 --> 08:32.470
We're only here because you people
used Ajin like lab animals!

08:35.598 --> 08:38.852
So, what are you gonna do?
Are you with us? Or not?

08:44.482 --> 08:45.608
UNKNOWN CALLER

08:46.359 --> 08:47.235
Hold on a second.

08:50.113 --> 08:50.947
Yes?

08:51.614 --> 08:54.117
<i>How about we make a deal.</i>

08:54.826 --> 08:55.744
Sokabe?

08:56.578 --> 08:59.622
We've got one hell of a situation
on our hands, huh?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.044
How about you cut to the chase?

09:05.462 --> 09:07.464
What a time to take a call.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.139
You. Do you know where Sato is?

09:16.222 --> 09:18.433
-He should be in his underground hideout.
-Come with me.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.729
What are you doing?!
Don't just stand there.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.409
Izumi, you're back!

09:42.082 --> 09:43.917
We're really gonna work with terrorists?

09:44.000 --> 09:47.796
Yes. We've got no time left,
and no other options.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.802
This is Takahashi, Gen, and Okuyama.

09:53.885 --> 09:54.719
Yo.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.184
A massacre.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.687
-Mister!
-We got them!

10:08.108 --> 10:09.567
It was you! You assholes...

10:12.112 --> 10:14.489
Hey, idiot! Stop!

10:14.572 --> 10:16.950
Where's the old man?!
Where are you hiding him?!

10:17.033 --> 10:18.910
Settle down, there.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.411
We let those guys go.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.706
What? Really?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.584
Yeah, he's probably back with his family.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.503
Hear that, you dumb kid?

10:29.087 --> 10:32.132
-Call me dumb again, you son of a--
-Stop it!

10:32.215 --> 10:33.341
Let me punch him!

10:33.424 --> 10:35.718
I said knock it off!

10:35.802 --> 10:36.845
Nagai!

10:39.681 --> 10:43.434
Can't believe we've got all these Ajin
in one spot.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.061
It's like my own personal harem.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.648
Yeah, I'll leave that to you.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.946
Knock it off, you guys.
Get the hell inside.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.576
Hang on just a moment.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.999
Not sure if this will be
to your liking or not, but...

11:10.545 --> 11:13.298
If we're gonna go, we've gotta go big.

11:18.511 --> 11:23.433
The U.S. military currently has the area
with the SDF Garrison cordoned off.

11:24.392 --> 11:28.980
They plan on sacrificing this entire area
in order to capture Sato.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.691
Sacrifice?

11:31.774 --> 11:34.569
They're going to disperse the nerve gas
below ground.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.280
This of course means that
tens of thousands will die.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.658
The operation starts at 3 a.m.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.702
We have roughly four hours left.

11:43.161 --> 11:46.164
Capture Sato before then,
no matter what it takes.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.081
Understood?

11:47.165 --> 11:49.000
Oh, yeah, we got it.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.546
However, the AASF is also moving
to capture Sato.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.549
One condition is that we
have to execute our operation

11:56.633 --> 11:58.134
without clashing with the AASF.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.307
So, as for our strategy...

12:05.224 --> 12:09.520
This is a map of subterranean Tokyo
that Okuyama made.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.191
Sato's hideout is here.

12:13.858 --> 12:17.153
Sato's plan is to lure
the U.S. military in and hit them here.

12:17.278 --> 12:21.991
In other words, he's fully prepared to
engage whatever or whoever comes at him.

12:23.618 --> 12:26.204
What in the world is Sato planning?

12:27.163 --> 12:29.999
The civil rights and independence demands
were just nonsense.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.377
What's his real goal?

12:34.420 --> 12:37.006
Tosaki, when you play a game,
are you thinking like:

12:37.090 --> 12:38.716
"I'm gonna save that princess!"

12:40.677 --> 12:44.263
-What are you talking about?
-The story's important,

12:44.347 --> 12:46.975
but you play the game
because stomping turtles is fun.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.477
Wouldn't know. I don't play games.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.648
He's saying Sato's a simple man.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.943
He's no revolutionary, nor tactician.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.278
He's just playing a game.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.366
But that's why he's got a weakness
we can capitalize on.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.493
What do you plan to do?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.288
Bury him alive.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.589
Tanaka, take care of that enemy there.

13:18.673 --> 13:22.135
No, that's kind of a late warning.

13:22.677 --> 13:23.970
I died.

13:25.722 --> 13:29.434
You're as bad at games
as you are at shooting.

13:29.684 --> 13:32.395
Yeah, sorry, this just isn't my thing.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.069
Oh, seems we have guests.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.489
Looks like it'll be a late night party.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.248
This is exciting.

13:52.331 --> 13:56.252
We're about to take on
the strongest army in the world.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.546
We must provide appropriate entertainment.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.802
Was this what you've wanted
this whole time?

14:05.970 --> 14:09.182
I mean, dragging the Americans into this.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.392
That's why you saved me,

14:11.476 --> 14:14.687
built up a team, and went through
with those terrorist attacks?

14:14.771 --> 14:16.647
Not at all!

14:16.731 --> 14:20.693
It's no fun if you know who
the last boss is from the get-go, right?

14:20.777 --> 14:24.489
Oh, so, this is the end?

14:25.990 --> 14:29.535
I mean, the game ends
when you beat the last boss, doesn't it?

14:30.953 --> 14:33.081
What do you mean, Tanaka?

14:33.706 --> 14:36.584
The best part of the game
is the second playthrough!

14:40.671 --> 14:41.714
Pardon me.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.095
Hate to interrupt your fun.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.681
So it's you, Nagai.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.100
That was fast.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.893
I'm impressed you found me.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.978
Even hiding in the sewers

14:56.062 --> 14:58.940
you can't cover up
your murderous stench.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.860
Okuyama and the others.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.822
I certainly didn't expect that.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.908
But that makes it interesting,
so whatever.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.910
I'll give you interesting.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.663
About that U.S. military
you're waiting for...

15:13.746 --> 15:16.624
By the way, Nagai,
do you remember how I told you

15:16.999 --> 15:21.212
that I hate it when people get in my way?

15:21.295 --> 15:22.422
Vaguely.

15:23.172 --> 15:26.300
But you're the one getting in the way
of my--

15:26.384 --> 15:29.887
I'm asking if you remember!

15:29.971 --> 15:31.973
Answer the question!

15:32.515 --> 15:36.269
There are three ways we can hit
someone like Sato.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.105
One, we can provoke him.

15:39.689 --> 15:40.815
Watch out!

15:41.649 --> 15:42.942
Go, Ghost!

15:43.693 --> 15:44.777
Kill him!

15:48.865 --> 15:51.367
Two, we can create a diversion.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.494
Pardon me...!

15:55.663 --> 15:56.831
Too bad.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.249
You lose.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.381
Ghost!

16:07.341 --> 16:08.468
Whoa, two in a row...?!

16:08.551 --> 16:11.387
He's as impressive as ever.

16:14.932 --> 16:15.808
Three.

16:16.392 --> 16:20.062
The fact that I'm a known threat,
coupled with my escape.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.485
We have to fall back!

16:27.987 --> 16:30.865
You won't get away today.

16:37.955 --> 16:41.334
If we can lure Sato to this point,

16:41.876 --> 16:45.129
we simply have to blow up the ceiling
and we can bury him alive.

16:45.213 --> 16:46.422
Makes sense.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.342
If he's buried alive,
it doesn't matter if he can regenerate.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.384
Exactly.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.470
And we win.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.397
One more time, Ghost!

17:04.649 --> 17:06.400
Stop them with all you've got!

17:07.026 --> 17:08.778
I know!

17:10.196 --> 17:12.990
How many can that kid make?

17:13.491 --> 17:17.662
Nagai's got a ton of black stuff
to work with.

17:25.419 --> 17:28.756
But even so, he can't make more than one
at the same time.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.676
Damn it!

17:31.759 --> 17:34.762
They stopped him!
I can't use my ghost for a while!

17:34.845 --> 17:36.013
Hurry!

17:36.097 --> 17:40.351
The only problem left is whether or not
you guys can stay ahead of Sato.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.812
I'll use my ghost.
We'll figure something out.

17:42.895 --> 17:47.066
The way you plan and think
is just like Sato.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.527
Although your endgame
could use a bit of work.

17:54.865 --> 17:55.700
Nagai!

17:59.078 --> 18:00.037
<i>Oh, well.</i>

18:00.580 --> 18:02.331
I'll have to arrange some insurance.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.085
It's fine.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.547
Let's go.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.520
So this is your handiwork, Okuyama.

18:25.605 --> 18:29.650
Sorry to have to do this.
We had some good times together.

18:43.372 --> 18:46.917
Sorry to bust your beloved toys, Okuyama.

18:47.001 --> 18:50.129
Since when did you learn to shoot?

18:51.130 --> 18:53.257
"Everything takes practice."

18:54.634 --> 18:55.718
Shall we get going?

18:57.345 --> 18:59.013
Yes, let's continue.

19:01.766 --> 19:02.933
I see it, Nagai!

19:03.017 --> 19:04.435
Just a bit more!

19:05.936 --> 19:07.605
They're here. Kuro-chan.

19:07.688 --> 19:11.150
Wait. We can't get stuck here.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.615
We can cut through here.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.915
I expect nothing less from an Ajin...

19:31.837 --> 19:32.963
What?!

19:38.511 --> 19:43.849
I wanted
to finish that talk from before, Sato!

19:45.685 --> 19:49.647
You can wait all you want,
but the U.S. military won't be coming.

19:50.356 --> 19:56.737
They're aiming to disable you
with the nerve gas.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.242
What?! Is that a joke?!

20:01.325 --> 20:02.702
All of us,

20:03.244 --> 20:08.749
we're sick of being
a part of your games!

20:10.000 --> 20:10.835
What?

20:13.754 --> 20:15.506
Buried alive, huh?

20:16.257 --> 20:17.591
Mr. Sato!

20:17.675 --> 20:19.760
Nice idea.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.554
However,

20:21.637 --> 20:24.140
just when you think you've won...

20:25.683 --> 20:28.894
somebody pulls the rug out
from under you.

20:47.079 --> 20:47.955
All right,

20:48.664 --> 20:50.166
I'm going to contact Sokabe.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.466
What is it?

20:58.549 --> 20:59.633
No way.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.635
-It's going to collapse?
-We overdid it.

21:01.719 --> 21:03.304
No, it's the floor!

21:03.387 --> 21:04.930
-We're going down!
-Mr. Tosaki!

21:17.735 --> 21:20.571
T-minus 35 minutes.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.630
I am going to kill

21:38.547 --> 21:40.299
each and every one of you.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.486
Mr. Tosaki!

22:01.570 --> 22:02.613
Are you all right?!

22:25.553 --> 22:28.931
Press start to play.

22:33.852 --> 22:36.230
TO BE CONTINUED

22:37.398 --> 22:40.442
<i>I'm tired of this one already, so</i>

22:40.526 --> 22:43.779
<i>I'll trade it</i>

22:43.862 --> 22:49.034
<i>For your ordinary one</i>

22:50.202 --> 22:56.458
<i>A shiny holy card</i>

22:56.584 --> 23:02.172
<i>For a grainy paper card</i>

23:02.923 --> 23:07.052
<i>You can see them all</i>

23:09.346 --> 23:13.767
<i>When you come to my house</i>

23:13.851 --> 23:19.898
<i>So</i>
<i>Two of us in the corner of the schoolyard</i>

23:19.982 --> 23:22.109
<i>While the wind blows</i>

23:22.192 --> 23:26.447
<i>I might be able to say it now</i>

23:28.574 --> 23:34.830
<i>Words I've never said to anyone</i>

23:34.913 --> 23:41.211
<i>"Won't you come and play, I'll be nice"</i>

23:41.295 --> 23:47.176
<i>"I'll give you anything, see"</i>

23:47.760 --> 23:50.471
<i>"Be my friend</i>

23:50.554 --> 23:57.353
<i>Always"</i>
