01:26.015 --> 01:29.827
ONE YEAR LATER

02:08.085 --> 02:10.143
Are those motherfuckers here?

02:20.243 --> 02:22.516
Let's slit their throats, brother,

02:22.569 --> 02:25.480
an example for other shitheads.

02:27.289 --> 02:29.330
Hold off a minute.

02:29.415 --> 02:31.148
Where's the Captain?

02:31.207 --> 02:33.076
Down there.

02:58.572 --> 03:00.384
Captain...

03:05.704 --> 03:08.190
Want to get out alive?

03:09.810 --> 03:11.284
Yes.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.796
Then you gotta do something for me.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.506
What are you thinikin'? Kill him!

03:41.564 --> 03:43.656
Take it easy, friend.

03:58.293 --> 04:01.662
Think he wouldn't do
the same thing to you?

04:06.890 --> 04:09.152
I've been through it too

04:09.368 --> 04:12.737
and it was
the luckiest day of my life.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.339
Look at me now,

04:15.522 --> 04:18.279
I'm now selling their stuff
all over Europe.

04:20.576 --> 04:22.560
Here, Captain.

06:39.848 --> 06:41.513
Captain...

06:57.602 --> 06:59.388
What's going on, Captain?

07:13.060 --> 07:14.484
No...

07:18.724 --> 07:21.800
Hey, hey, relax, relax, relax.

07:28.411 --> 07:31.568
Hey, hey, it's okay, relax.

08:33.609 --> 08:35.441
Look!

08:35.640 --> 08:39.544
A captain of the Honduran Army
just enrolled in our cause.

08:41.756 --> 08:44.203
Our cause...

08:46.421 --> 08:48.891
You're a real son of a bitch,
brother.

08:54.749 --> 08:56.871
Take him near his camp

08:57.074 --> 08:58.868
and free him.

08:59.293 --> 09:01.437
Come on, asshole, up.

09:04.607 --> 09:07.103
Now take me to the airport,

09:07.181 --> 09:08.525
my time's come.

09:08.647 --> 09:10.343
Fuck.

09:11.486 --> 09:13.980
You'll be bored without me, brother.

09:14.289 --> 09:17.553
I've been waiting a long time

09:17.692 --> 09:20.208
and my time has finally come.

10:21.203 --> 10:24.102
- Hello.
- Good afternoon, can I help you?

10:30.590 --> 10:33.477
Welcome, Mr. Savastano,
we've been waiting for you.

10:33.583 --> 10:35.860
- Thank you.
- I'll inform Mr. Avitabile.

10:40.980 --> 10:42.238
Yes.

10:43.471 --> 10:46.456
You've been taking 5.000 euros
a month for three years.

10:46.875 --> 10:48.870
Why, do you think,

10:48.929 --> 10:50.705
I gave you that money?

10:50.761 --> 10:53.571
To be the first to know
the others' bids.

10:53.638 --> 10:57.683
This contract must be mine, I can't
lose it because you fucked up.

10:57.734 --> 11:00.448
- It's out of my hands.
- I gotta build.

11:00.501 --> 11:03.559
If I don't, lots of families
end up on the streets.

11:03.619 --> 11:06.524
- I know.
- Who knows what might happen.

11:08.397 --> 11:11.420
No. No. No!

11:12.016 --> 11:14.355
Hungry people lose their heads!

11:14.427 --> 11:16.203
He's here.

11:18.967 --> 11:20.583
Okay.

11:23.126 --> 11:25.339
The Councilman and I
have an understanding.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.446
Gennaro, finally!

11:36.599 --> 11:38.034
Good afternoon, Don Giuseppe.

11:38.100 --> 11:41.143
- It's a pleasure to host you.
- The pleasure's mine.

11:42.090 --> 11:44.362
I've given you my best suite.

11:45.151 --> 11:47.934
I've never had
the chance to tell you,

11:47.993 --> 11:50.903
but the quality of your goods
is phenomenal.

11:51.389 --> 11:55.437
Mom always said: in business,
the quality of goods is fundamental.

11:55.545 --> 11:58.632
Speaking of goods, are we set?

11:58.812 --> 12:01.258
It gets into Malaga on the 22nd.

12:01.327 --> 12:02.740
Perfect.

12:05.709 --> 12:08.058
We're expanding every day,

12:08.781 --> 12:11.904
if you want, I could buy
everything you bring.

12:12.367 --> 12:14.965
With your goods and my organization

12:15.052 --> 12:17.680
Rome will be ours.

12:19.621 --> 12:22.088
It's an attractive offer,

12:22.161 --> 12:25.336
but my goods are free on the market
for everybody.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.137
And I've got family problems
to solve.

12:31.559 --> 12:33.153
That's fair,

12:33.302 --> 12:35.264
family comes first.

12:35.660 --> 12:39.306
Not now, but in a few days,
when you're more relaxed,

12:39.696 --> 12:41.319
think about it.

12:42.256 --> 12:45.247
I could buy 1000-2000 kilos a month,

12:45.319 --> 12:47.086
it's up to you.

12:55.694 --> 12:57.529
Like it?

12:57.753 --> 12:59.196
Nice!

12:59.247 --> 13:00.920
I'm pleased.

13:01.365 --> 13:04.001
If you need anything else, call me.

13:06.172 --> 13:08.419
All I need's a car.

13:08.487 --> 13:09.901
No problem.

13:11.382 --> 13:13.957
I'll tell my daughter, remember her?

13:15.749 --> 13:18.942
I'll have her come,
her name's Azzurra.

13:36.667 --> 13:37.873
Who's there?

13:44.804 --> 13:46.790
Who is it?

13:57.721 --> 14:00.354
I'm here for the car.

14:09.866 --> 14:12.181
What kind of car would you like?

14:15.897 --> 14:17.826
One that runs.

14:23.512 --> 14:25.985
My father says you don't remember me.

14:30.427 --> 14:32.530
So, you don't remember?

14:37.873 --> 14:40.900
Guess I need to refresh your memory.

14:43.138 --> 14:46.247
Azzurra, I don't want
to piss your father off.

14:47.259 --> 14:50.591
My father
no longer tells me what to do.

14:56.126 --> 14:57.925
Was that a big mistake?

14:57.991 --> 14:59.667
Who knows!

21:09.051 --> 21:11.781
These tanks are like cows' tits!

21:16.335 --> 21:18.820
But instead of milk...

21:20.631 --> 21:23.586
there's gasoline from the East.

21:25.864 --> 21:28.094
Doesn't cost a fucking thing,

21:28.484 --> 21:31.445
you just bribe some customs officers

21:32.043 --> 21:34.612
and get gas stations like these.

21:37.392 --> 21:41.591
The Calabrians are making
stacks of money like that.

21:47.728 --> 21:51.019
Just one problem,
this place is a shithole

21:51.685 --> 21:54.887
and even if we rule, we're nobodies.

22:00.497 --> 22:02.116
You look good.

22:28.068 --> 22:30.094
Been a long time!

22:33.370 --> 22:35.371
You're just a little whiter.

22:35.427 --> 22:38.026
This shit country's never seen the sun.

22:38.491 --> 22:41.228
I noticed, it's fuckin' freezing.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.776
I made you wait

22:43.851 --> 22:46.212
to make sure no asshole was on you.

22:46.268 --> 22:48.709
Okay, but let's go, I'm hungry.

22:51.064 --> 22:52.679
Where are they?

22:55.479 --> 22:57.394
In my bag.

23:02.653 --> 23:05.240
Before going home,
we have to meet a Calabrian guy.

23:05.381 --> 23:07.037
- Here?
- No.

23:07.160 --> 23:08.959
Somewhere else.

23:09.030 --> 23:11.889
Any problems, besides the cold?

23:11.949 --> 23:13.112
No, just to know.

23:13.173 --> 23:16.199
If I know stuff, you don't need to.

23:33.136 --> 23:34.789
So?

23:44.568 --> 23:46.898
I'd say...

23:47.301 --> 23:48.871
that these

23:48.937 --> 23:52.698
are of the lowest quality.

23:54.048 --> 23:56.320
Grade... I'd say "M".

23:59.093 --> 24:01.323
You let me down.

24:02.316 --> 24:05.376
I can't give you what you asked.

24:05.443 --> 24:07.810
Yeah, but there's loads

24:07.873 --> 24:10.875
and for our needs,
it's more than enough.

24:17.425 --> 24:20.355
A friend talked to me about you.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.755
Good or bad?

24:26.338 --> 24:28.749
What matters is they talked.

24:32.280 --> 24:35.073
They talked to me about you too.

24:43.935 --> 24:47.498
This kid of yours has big balls,
huh, Don Pietro?

24:47.571 --> 24:50.101
That's what they say
where you're from?

24:55.664 --> 24:58.011
Kids are blood, sweat and tears,

24:58.067 --> 24:59.686
you know that.

25:00.202 --> 25:02.449
But let's talk about us,

25:02.505 --> 25:04.430
it's more important.

26:09.708 --> 26:11.987
I'll make spaghetti with sauce.

26:15.125 --> 26:17.828
I'd rather have something else.

26:20.015 --> 26:22.040
You do what I say.

29:49.475 --> 29:51.768
What is it, Gennaro?

29:52.761 --> 29:54.710
Can't sleep?

29:57.046 --> 29:58.828
I'm worried.

29:59.839 --> 30:01.662
About what?

30:02.371 --> 30:03.989
Mico.

30:06.857 --> 30:10.526
I knew he was your contact here,
so I asked around.

30:17.706 --> 30:20.518
Who did you ask?

30:22.687 --> 30:25.055
Selling drugs,
I've made lots of friends,

30:25.110 --> 30:26.780
especially among Calabrians.

30:26.829 --> 30:29.322
And what did these friends say?

30:29.381 --> 30:33.506
They had a meeting in Polsi
and "The Mother" is really pissed.

30:33.603 --> 30:35.495
Be clearer.

30:39.174 --> 30:42.096
There's a contract out on Mico,

30:43.105 --> 30:46.533
we gotta stop dealing with him,
get our weapons somewhere else.

30:47.036 --> 30:49.241
From who, Gennarino?

30:55.933 --> 30:59.499
Think I've been stuck here
for a year 'cause I like it?

31:01.173 --> 31:03.559
I can't wait to get home.

31:05.875 --> 31:08.679
If I've been here for a year,

31:10.393 --> 31:13.457
it's because things
aren't so good for us.

31:14.458 --> 31:17.632
We can't touch our money.

31:18.987 --> 31:21.808
Our friends, our front-men,

31:21.852 --> 31:23.990
are all under investigation.

31:24.497 --> 31:27.021
Our bank accounts are frozen

31:28.047 --> 31:31.303
so, with no money
and the police on our tails,

31:31.356 --> 31:33.503
no one wants to do business with us.

31:37.823 --> 31:40.150
Except those with no alternative.

31:41.143 --> 31:42.687
See?

31:44.284 --> 31:46.653
You got it.

31:46.708 --> 31:48.905
But that's no good!

31:54.905 --> 31:56.860
Twenty years...

31:56.914 --> 31:59.262
eyes wide open,

31:59.940 --> 32:02.408
on friends,

32:02.747 --> 32:04.480
enemies,

32:04.831 --> 32:06.849
traitors.

32:08.525 --> 32:10.488
Twenty years.

32:14.915 --> 32:18.021
Then I passed it all on to you.

32:22.635 --> 32:25.413
You had to man the boat,

32:27.003 --> 32:29.715
and where did you take us?

32:31.636 --> 32:35.260
Now you're here to tell me
what we gotta do?

32:37.800 --> 32:40.111
Your mother always said:

32:40.179 --> 32:42.405
"You spoil him too much,

32:42.473 --> 32:46.087
you give in to all the crap
in his head".

32:46.759 --> 32:49.919
I'd say: "Don't worry, be patient,

32:50.984 --> 32:54.726
he's not like you and me,
he needs time".

33:00.620 --> 33:03.121
But now time's run out,

33:03.448 --> 33:05.372
got that or not?

33:06.296 --> 33:08.157
You went too far.

33:17.415 --> 33:19.922
I came to you for help,

33:21.627 --> 33:24.281
but you were actin' crazy in jail,

33:24.759 --> 33:29.301
you left us alone,
and you knew one word would do.

33:30.578 --> 33:32.741
What do you mean?

33:34.620 --> 33:37.064
If you hadn't played crazy,

33:37.111 --> 33:40.515
not giving a shit about us,
Mom would still be here.

33:40.692 --> 33:42.918
You piece of shit!

33:43.274 --> 33:45.478
How the fuck dare you?

33:45.856 --> 33:48.661
Do you know why
I acted crazy in jail?

33:49.011 --> 33:51.476
Because I knew

33:51.532 --> 33:53.697
you weren't up to it

33:53.750 --> 33:57.188
and the only way to save
things was to get out.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.344
But I was too late.

36:20.292 --> 36:22.473
I'm gonna shower.

37:29.314 --> 37:31.841
With these, you can hunt your traitors,

37:31.905 --> 37:34.430
and make a big hole in their asses.

37:36.887 --> 37:38.707
Don Pietro...

38:18.178 --> 38:20.036
Holy shit!

38:23.283 --> 38:25.411
Fuck, what a blast!

38:25.470 --> 38:28.071
This thing shakes the ground.

38:30.594 --> 38:33.072
Let's get warmed up at my club.

38:36.003 --> 38:38.348
It's like I've accepted, Mico.

38:38.876 --> 38:41.714
No, without "like".

38:41.765 --> 38:43.725
Gaetano, here.

38:50.070 --> 38:53.633
I know I'm part of a system
that's bigger than me,

38:54.272 --> 38:56.603
but I want to say one thing.

38:56.672 --> 38:59.732
These guys are
the worst pigs in the world.

38:59.795 --> 39:03.003
I feel a thousand times more honest
than all of them.

39:05.839 --> 39:08.460
When they speak, it makes me vomit.

39:08.532 --> 39:10.404
"The Mother", the Federation,

39:10.473 --> 39:12.037
meet that guy,
speak to the other guy,

39:12.081 --> 39:14.492
ask for approval from yet another...

39:14.869 --> 39:17.876
But Mico Rende made his own way

39:17.934 --> 39:20.057
in this shitty country,
in this fuckin' cold,

39:20.120 --> 39:22.285
and you know it.

39:22.346 --> 39:26.355
So, now Mico gives himself orders.

39:37.533 --> 39:39.290
Please, eat.

39:41.143 --> 39:43.013
Dad...

39:44.023 --> 39:46.430
can you come a second?

39:48.414 --> 39:50.310
Excuse me a second.

39:57.155 --> 39:59.285
What's the matter?

39:59.385 --> 40:02.128
- Dad, we gotta go.
- Why?

40:02.197 --> 40:04.088
Remember what I said about Mico?

40:04.156 --> 40:05.960
Gennaro, no quizzes.

40:06.012 --> 40:09.113
My Calabrian friends warned me
they're coming.

42:00.631 --> 42:02.437
Stop the car.

42:12.107 --> 42:13.893
Get out and walk close to me.

44:17.218 --> 44:20.002
- What's wrong?
- I can't make it.

44:20.071 --> 44:23.546
- We gotta go.
- I can't make it, I don't feel good!

44:58.755 --> 45:00.588
Be right back.

46:31.243 --> 46:33.014
Move!

49:52.834 --> 49:54.637
C'mon, Dad.

52:54.837 --> 52:56.700
It's me,

52:57.347 --> 52:59.624
come pick me up.

53:00.585 --> 53:02.472
Deichstraße.

54:13.693 --> 54:16.122
Germany's burnt,

54:17.739 --> 54:20.364
we'd better go our separate ways.

54:22.534 --> 54:25.070
Go back where you were
and don't worry,

54:25.573 --> 54:28.217
I'll be in touch, if need be.

54:34.048 --> 54:36.548
Your time will come too.

54:37.228 --> 54:39.648
Life's long, Gennarino!

54:40.837 --> 54:43.591
But now, I have to do my part,

54:43.902 --> 54:46.519
and I'd rather do it on my own.
