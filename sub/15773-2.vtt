The country club is
for members only.

- Well, I'm a member.
- What's your membership number?

00:27.196 --> 00:29.798
- One.
I'm number one.

00:29.865 --> 00:32.033
- One is not
a valid membership number.

00:32.101 --> 00:33.902
- Did I say one?
I meant two.

00:33.969 --> 00:37.472
- Sir, if you're not a member,
I'm going to have to insist
that you exit the property.

00:37.540 --> 00:39.708
- Fine. I don't want
to belong to a club

00:39.775 --> 00:41.476
That would have me
as a member, anyway.

as a member.

we both won,

'cause I just scored a date
with a beautiful woman.

I'm allergic to butter.

05:34.779 --> 05:37.180
Oh! No, wait.
It's gluten, not butter.

No, wait. Not gluten, pollen.

You know what?
Now that I'm thinking about it,

05:46.657 --> 05:47.991
I don't really want
carrot soup.

05:48.059 --> 05:50.727

07:06.270 --> 07:08.538

to make a long story short--

07:08.606 --> 07:10.206
Wait. What was I talking about?

07:10.274 --> 07:11.808
- I have no idea.

- [gasps] oh, my gosh.
I never peed.

That girl's exhausting.

07:52.850 --> 07:55.285
I mean, I barely said
a single word all night.

She just keeps talking
and talking and talking.

how to listen.

You should do more cardio
and less weights.

Oh, thank goodness
you're ok.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.250
Now, ladies,

11:56.317 --> 12:00.388
What I'm about to tell you
does not leave this table.

12:00.454 --> 12:03.391
Estelle and abe
are breaking up.

12:03.458 --> 12:04.825
- [all gasp]

12:04.893 --> 12:06.894
- You didn't hear it from me,

12:06.962 --> 12:10.498
But apparently,
abe prefers blondes.

12:10.565 --> 12:14.501
Don't get your hopes up,
phyllis--natural blondes.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.337
[laughter]

12:16.404 --> 12:19.906
- Hi, estelle.
Give my regards to abe.

12:19.975 --> 12:23.077
[laughter]

12:23.144 --> 12:25.312
[sighs]

12:27.149 --> 12:29.316
- Time for plan "b."

12:32.054 --> 12:34.154
- Where is bugs?

12:34.221 --> 12:35.655
- [high-pitched voice]
bugs bunny?

12:35.723 --> 12:36.990
- You know him?

12:37.058 --> 12:38.826
- Oh, I know him.

12:38.894 --> 12:42.496
Bugs bunny is the worst man
I've ever met!

12:42.564 --> 12:43.564
- Bugs bunny is a saint.

12:43.632 --> 12:46.067
- That's what
he'd have you believe.

12:46.134 --> 12:48.903
Let me guess--
you met him on
a tennis court?

12:48.970 --> 12:51.038
- [gasps]
- unbelievable.

12:51.106 --> 12:55.209
Let me give you
a little piece of advice,
girl to girl?

12:55.277 --> 12:58.879
If you don't want
your heart shattered
into a million pieces,

12:58.947 --> 13:02.183
You'll break up
with bugs bunny today.

13:04.819 --> 13:06.554
- [whistles]

13:06.621 --> 13:08.989
- Hey, lola.
Sorry I'm late.

13:09.057 --> 13:10.391
- Oh, I'm not.

13:10.459 --> 13:12.760
I just had
a very interesting conversation

13:12.827 --> 13:14.095
With an ugly woman.

13:14.162 --> 13:16.764
- Ugly?
- Very ugly.

13:16.832 --> 13:19.433
But she told me something
that has me looking at you

13:19.500 --> 13:22.103
In an entirely
different way.

13:22.170 --> 13:24.771
Bugs bunny, you...

13:24.840 --> 13:27.374
Are a bad boy.

13:27.442 --> 13:30.443
I've never been
with a bad boy before.

13:30.511 --> 13:33.447
That makes me a bad girl.
[giggles] meow!

13:33.515 --> 13:36.016
- Lola!
Over here, darling!

13:37.119 --> 13:39.319
- Who are they?
- My parents.

13:39.386 --> 13:40.888
It's about time
you guys met.

13:40.956 --> 13:42.957
Be on your best behavior,
bad boy.

13:43.024 --> 13:47.361
- Bugs. [chuckles]
lola's told us
so much about you.

13:47.429 --> 13:49.596
- She doesn't know anything
about me.

13:49.663 --> 13:53.534
- [laughs] see?
Told you he was funny.

13:53.602 --> 13:56.136
[laughter]

13:56.203 --> 13:58.204
- Oh, he's wonderful.

13:58.273 --> 14:03.010
- Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

14:04.346 --> 14:06.380
You have to end this.

14:06.448 --> 14:08.548
I don't care if she cries.

14:08.616 --> 14:10.885
I don't care
that her parents are there.

14:10.952 --> 14:14.020
She's crazy,
and this ends now.

14:15.690 --> 14:18.358
And you are not
an ugly woman.

14:18.425 --> 14:22.096
Ooh! A mint.
Thanks for the pep talk.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.067
You can do this.
It's like ripping off
a bandage.

14:27.135 --> 14:29.103
- I don't know what it is,
but it's like we complete
each other.

14:29.171 --> 14:33.240
- Ooh!
- We're soul mates! Ooh!

14:35.309 --> 14:36.977
Yes!
- What?

14:37.045 --> 14:39.547
- Of course
I'll marry you!

14:39.614 --> 14:41.148
- Huh?
- Ahem.

14:41.216 --> 14:44.050
My daughter's
getting married.

14:44.119 --> 14:47.587
To the future
mr. And mrs. Bugs bunny,

14:47.655 --> 14:50.857
And the son I never had.

14:50.925 --> 14:53.727
- Bravo!
[cheering]

14:53.795 --> 14:56.130
- Oh, it's so romantic!

14:56.198 --> 14:57.631
- Why are we clapping?

14:57.699 --> 15:00.034
- One of the club members
just got engaged.

15:00.101 --> 15:03.370
- Darling, send the happy couple
a bottle of your best bubbly,

15:03.438 --> 15:05.972
Compliments of 1673.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.776
- Someone's bucking
for club president.

15:09.811 --> 15:11.077
- Well, you know
what they say,

15:11.145 --> 15:12.846
First comes love,
then comes marriage,

15:12.913 --> 15:15.348
Then comes lots of bunnies
in a baby carriage. Ooh!

15:15.417 --> 15:17.518
- Ehh...

15:17.586 --> 15:19.252
- Wait until you meet pepe.

15:19.321 --> 15:22.122
He's the wedding planner
for the r.O.G.O.O.O.C.C.

15:22.190 --> 15:24.692
- Can't you people just say
country club?

15:24.759 --> 15:28.194
- Lola, mon cherie.
Mwah! Mwah!

15:28.263 --> 15:30.864
And this must be
the lucky groom.

15:30.932 --> 15:32.365
Mwah! Mwah!

15:32.433 --> 15:36.403
Mmm. So lucky.
So, so lucky.

15:36.471 --> 15:40.007
Your wedding day is
the single most important
day of your life.

15:40.075 --> 15:42.543
I should know--
I've been married 7 times.

15:42.611 --> 15:46.113
Now, I'm seeing
an outdoor ceremony.

15:46.181 --> 15:49.450
You should feel
the beauty of nature
embracing you

15:49.517 --> 15:51.285
As you walk down the aisle,

15:51.353 --> 15:54.721
The smell of honeysuckle
kissing your cheeks

15:54.788 --> 15:56.890
As you exchange your vows.

15:56.958 --> 15:58.491
- Ugh.

15:58.559 --> 16:00.827
- There won't be a dry eye
in the house.

16:00.894 --> 16:02.730
- I'll be crying harder
than anyone.

16:02.797 --> 16:05.732
- What's wrong, bun-bun?
You don't want a big wedding?

16:05.799 --> 16:07.567
Well, we could have
a small wedding,

16:07.635 --> 16:08.902
Or a wedding on the beach.

16:08.970 --> 16:10.404
Or we could get married
in vegas.

16:10.471 --> 16:11.904
Or we could just go down
to the courthouse right now!

16:11.972 --> 16:13.240
- Or...
- [gasps]

16:13.308 --> 16:15.509
- We could just
not get married.

16:15.577 --> 16:16.943
- [sobs]

16:17.011 --> 16:19.212
What is going on
with you?

16:19.280 --> 16:23.116
This isn't the bugs I know!
[crying]

16:23.183 --> 16:25.085
Mwah!

16:25.153 --> 16:26.319
Love you.

16:26.388 --> 16:28.454
Don't forget,
we're having dinner
with my parents.

16:28.523 --> 16:30.958
[crying]

16:31.026 --> 16:34.528
- Mmm. So lucky.

16:35.730 --> 16:36.963
- Good game, nakamora.

16:37.031 --> 16:39.799
Sorry about
losing my temper on 14.

16:39.867 --> 16:41.802
And for throwing your clubs
in the water.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.404
Go buy yourself
a new set.

16:43.471 --> 16:45.405
Charge it to 1673.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.973
- [groans]

16:47.042 --> 16:48.909
- Ooh!

16:48.977 --> 16:52.546
I haven't crashed
a wedding in a few months.

16:52.614 --> 16:56.817
- Ahh. Are you a guest of
the bride or the groom?

16:56.885 --> 16:58.686
Please say the groom.

16:58.752 --> 17:00.154
- I don't know
either of them,

17:00.221 --> 17:01.689
But if there's
more of these guys,

17:01.756 --> 17:03.323
I'll sit
wherever you want.

17:10.898 --> 17:14.101
[coughs]
what are you doing here?

17:14.169 --> 17:16.669
Did you sneak
into the club using

17:16.738 --> 17:18.939
Someone else's
membership number?

17:19.006 --> 17:21.340
[gasps]
disgraceful.

17:21.409 --> 17:24.044
- I didn't sneak in.
This is my wedding.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.546
- [gasps]
you're getting married?

17:26.613 --> 17:29.249
And you didn't ask me
to be the best man?

17:29.316 --> 17:31.184
You didn't even invite me!

17:31.251 --> 17:35.189
Do not expect
a quality wedding gift from me.

17:35.256 --> 17:36.557
- [gasps]

17:36.624 --> 17:38.792
["wedding March" playing]

17:46.334 --> 17:48.202
- We are gathered here today

17:48.269 --> 17:52.472
To celebrate the marriage
of bugs and lola.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.575
Before we begin,
if anyone objects
to this marriage,

17:55.642 --> 17:59.046
Speak now,
or forever hold your peace.

17:59.113 --> 18:00.847
- [grunts]

18:03.852 --> 18:05.385
- I object.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.620
- What?
- I'm sorry, bun-bun.

18:07.689 --> 18:10.057
[sighs]
I know how much you love me,

18:10.124 --> 18:11.557
But I can't marry you,

18:11.626 --> 18:13.526
Because I'm in love
with someone else.

18:13.595 --> 18:15.294
- [all gasp]

18:15.363 --> 18:16.796
- I'm in love with him.

18:16.865 --> 18:20.767
- You know what they say--
the eighth time's a charm.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.269
- Will you ever
get over me?

18:22.336 --> 18:25.139
- It's going to take
a long time.

18:25.206 --> 18:28.941
We probably shouldn't talk
for a while.

18:29.010 --> 18:33.046
- I understand.
Peppers!

18:33.113 --> 18:35.115
- So lucky.

18:35.182 --> 18:38.785
So, so lucky.

18:38.852 --> 18:41.655
- Bugs bunny. Dumped.

18:41.722 --> 18:44.957
I've been there, brother.
You'll never get over it.

18:45.026 --> 18:47.628
Let me buy you
some golf clubs.

18:47.695 --> 18:51.798
Waiter! Bring this man
your finest set of golf clubs,

18:51.865 --> 18:54.735
And charge it to 1673!

18:54.803 --> 18:56.970
- 1673?

18:57.037 --> 18:59.305
That's my membership number.
