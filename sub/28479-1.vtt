Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:27.236 --> 01:28.469
In
case you were wondering

01:28.471 --> 01:30.340
how I wound up in this
farcical situation,

01:32.240 --> 01:33.407
let me catch you up.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.484
My name is Barbra Dolly Brennan.

01:43.486 --> 01:47.288
My parents named me after Barbra
Streisand and Dolly Parton,

01:47.290 --> 01:48.389
their favorite singers.

01:48.391 --> 01:53.092
I'm a cosplayer, model,
blogger, and fitness goddess.

01:53.094 --> 01:54.428
What is that, you ask?

01:54.430 --> 01:56.362
What are you, a hermit?

01:56.364 --> 01:59.466
It means I spend my days
doing selfies, posing,

01:59.468 --> 02:04.103
and doing endless videos
of my ass doing squats.

02:04.105 --> 02:05.172
Endless squats.

02:05.174 --> 02:06.407
Hundreds of squats.

02:06.409 --> 02:08.274
Thousands of squats.

02:08.276 --> 02:10.945
You can find me at
Breaking underscore Barbi.

02:10.947 --> 02:15.582
Sounds easy but it's
actually really hard.

02:15.584 --> 02:17.284
It means that anything I do

02:17.286 --> 02:20.321
suddenly turns into a
photo shoot, a video opp,

02:20.323 --> 02:22.388
or an opportunity for a collab.

02:22.390 --> 02:26.493
This type of work comes
with a major downside,

02:26.495 --> 02:27.560
meeting a nice guy.

02:27.562 --> 02:29.996
You have to be choosy, you know.

02:29.998 --> 02:32.733
I mean, like, what if
I'm seen with a guy

02:32.735 --> 02:36.436
that doesn't even have at
least 10,000 followers?

02:36.438 --> 02:38.505
That would be unthinkable.

02:38.507 --> 02:40.239
I have my reputation.

02:40.241 --> 02:42.643
And then I met Jake.

02:42.645 --> 02:45.314
250,000 followers.

02:46.414 --> 02:47.481
Plenty of water.

02:48.751 --> 02:51.484
Got the first aid kit in
case of any emergency.

02:51.486 --> 02:52.252
- Got bandages.
- OMG, he is

02:52.254 --> 02:54.554
- so fire.
- Ointment, wet wipes.

02:54.556 --> 02:56.090
- Food rations.
- I wonder how many hash tags

02:56.092 --> 02:57.560
I can fit into this post.

02:59.328 --> 03:00.727
Sunscreen.

03:00.729 --> 03:02.228
Lip ointment.

03:02.230 --> 03:03.763
Antibacterial gel.

03:03.765 --> 03:05.465
Flashlight.

03:05.467 --> 03:07.267
He asked
me to go hiking with him

03:07.269 --> 03:08.401
on our first date.

03:13.308 --> 03:14.210
I just can't even.

03:42.604 --> 03:44.304
Antibacterial gel.

03:44.306 --> 03:45.439
Flashlight.

03:45.441 --> 03:46.276
Compass.

03:51.212 --> 03:52.181
Extra battery.

03:53.348 --> 03:54.614
Security blanket.

03:54.616 --> 03:56.517
- He's so into this!
- Rope and tackle.

03:56.519 --> 03:57.351
Look at all those

03:57.353 --> 03:59.085
cute things he brought.

03:59.087 --> 04:02.089
And most importantly,
a radio and GPS tracker

04:02.091 --> 04:03.357
so we can't get lost

04:03.359 --> 04:05.225
and we can call for help
in case of an emergency.

04:05.227 --> 04:06.560
- I
- totes need a selfie.

04:06.562 --> 04:08.061
Oh, like right now.

04:08.063 --> 04:08.697
Selfie.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.433
- My turn.
- Jessica will be

04:12.435 --> 04:14.003
totally jelly when she
sees me with this guy.

04:16.204 --> 04:17.538
All right, I think
that's everything.

04:17.540 --> 04:18.772
You ready?

04:18.774 --> 04:20.507
You better believe it.

04:20.509 --> 04:21.442
Yep.

04:21.444 --> 04:22.310
You wanna do a last check?

04:22.312 --> 04:23.776
We're gonna be up
there for a while.

04:23.778 --> 04:24.577
- I
- have everything I need

04:24.579 --> 04:26.546
right here, baby.

04:26.548 --> 04:28.248
Don't need this.

04:28.250 --> 04:31.053
Lip gloss, headset, mud mask.

04:32.153 --> 04:34.490
And a little something
for the hot tub.

04:40.129 --> 04:40.860
I'm good.

04:40.862 --> 04:43.266
All right, let's do this.

04:50.172 --> 04:52.609
Did I
tell her how cute she looks?

04:54.209 --> 04:57.510
Hey, can I, can I
put my keys on you?

04:57.512 --> 04:58.647
Yeah, sure.

05:28.144 --> 05:29.709
I'm glad you swiped right.

05:29.711 --> 05:33.413
It's really hard to find
girls that like to free-climb.

05:33.415 --> 05:35.682
What the
hell is he talking about?

05:35.684 --> 05:38.584
Oh, my profile.

05:38.586 --> 05:41.587
I thought free-climbing
was some sort of sex thing.

05:41.589 --> 05:43.623
Well, when the app
asked for what level,

05:43.625 --> 05:45.858
I obviously wrote expert.

05:45.860 --> 05:46.695
Gosh.

05:53.168 --> 05:53.802
Oh.

05:55.336 --> 05:57.603
This is pretty
hardcore, even for me.

05:57.605 --> 05:59.473
Wait, is he serious?

05:59.475 --> 06:01.175
I thought we were gonna
take some cute selfies

06:01.177 --> 06:02.479
and go back to his place.

06:03.745 --> 06:04.978
We could've started
with something simpler,

06:04.980 --> 06:07.716
but I mean, I'm sure at your
level this is a piece of cake.

06:08.783 --> 06:10.216
Way to go, Barbs.

06:10.218 --> 06:11.687
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

06:15.290 --> 06:16.593
Was that a pterodactyl?

06:17.660 --> 06:19.692
OMG, I'm so gonna die.

06:19.694 --> 06:21.894
I mean, anything can
happen out there.

06:21.896 --> 06:23.663
I can be eaten by a
bear, fall of a cliff,

06:23.665 --> 06:26.802
butt-raped by aliens, dragged
away by wolves, anything!

06:27.702 --> 06:28.969
Let's go.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.773
And
I just got these shoes.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.310
Ugh, just look at that butt.

06:35.511 --> 06:37.747
He definitely
doesn't skip leg day.

06:41.416 --> 06:42.618
Totally worth it.

06:43.586 --> 06:44.420
No sweat.

06:45.387 --> 06:47.654
- I
- hope he eats pineapple.

07:12.480 --> 07:16.416
Aw, that's so sweet.

07:16.418 --> 07:18.388
She's going slow
and waiting for me.

07:20.255 --> 07:21.857
Aw, he's so sweet.

07:29.430 --> 07:31.365
OMG, it is pineapple!

07:31.367 --> 07:32.201
Mm!

07:43.879 --> 07:44.711
- I
- can't wait to invite her

07:44.713 --> 07:46.216
to my mansion in Hawaii.

07:47.382 --> 07:48.649
This isn't so bad,

07:48.651 --> 07:51.817
but I could totally go
for a latte right now.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.786
You
know, I'm gonna slow down

07:53.788 --> 07:55.355
and let her get ahead of me,

07:55.357 --> 07:56.960
so if she falls I can catch her.

08:01.562 --> 08:03.899
Everything about her is perfect.

08:05.533 --> 08:06.666
I hope
there's a Starbucks up there

08:06.668 --> 08:07.502
or something.

08:12.473 --> 08:13.707
- I
- can see myself spending

08:13.709 --> 08:16.411
the rest of my life
with this girl.

08:26.555 --> 08:29.792
Phew,
almost at the top.

08:33.828 --> 08:35.798
Sure hope we're not
going down that way.

08:37.732 --> 08:38.567
Whew!

08:54.615 --> 08:55.451
Jake?

08:56.784 --> 08:58.852
There's no signal up here.

08:58.854 --> 08:59.855
Jake?

09:02.658 --> 09:03.493
Jake?

09:04.927 --> 09:05.561
Jake?

09:07.929 --> 09:09.765
What are you doing down there?

09:24.846 --> 09:27.649
Ugh, there's no signal up here!

09:28.951 --> 09:29.786
Ugh.

09:32.086 --> 09:34.387
Maybe
there's some signal,

09:34.389 --> 09:36.859
mm, over here.

09:47.503 --> 09:50.903
Whoa!

09:54.809 --> 09:55.644
Jake?

09:59.148 --> 10:00.082
Are you okay?

10:17.131 --> 10:18.565
O!

10:18.567 --> 10:19.900
O!

10:19.902 --> 10:21.600
M!

10:21.602 --> 10:23.002
M!

10:23.004 --> 10:24.537
G!

10:24.539 --> 10:25.704
G!

10:33.682 --> 10:36.715
Did I just kill the
hottest guy ever?

10:36.717 --> 10:37.950
I didn't know about the rock.

10:37.952 --> 10:39.486
I mean, I didn't
put the rock there.

10:39.488 --> 10:40.454
The rock, who put
the rock there?

10:40.456 --> 10:41.954
Like, Mother Nature and stuff.

10:41.956 --> 10:42.789
It's not my fault.

10:42.791 --> 10:43.623
I didn't do it.

10:43.625 --> 10:44.458
It's not me.

10:44.460 --> 10:45.157
I would never do that.

11:03.044 --> 11:04.844
Now I'm totally lost.

11:04.846 --> 11:08.047
No signal, no date,
no food, no water.

11:08.049 --> 11:11.453
Didn't see this bag of dicks
coming straight at my face.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.854
This is insane!

11:14.856 --> 11:16.055
I can't believe I'm out here.

11:16.057 --> 11:20.797
And the worst part is I can't
upload these amazing selfies.

11:22.197 --> 11:25.866
Why don't they put cell
towers out here or something?

11:25.868 --> 11:28.901
Ugh, ugh, like, no
signal anywhere.

11:32.139 --> 11:34.206
I mean, if you're gonna
be banished up here,

11:34.208 --> 11:37.009
you're gonna wind up
dead anyway soon, right?

11:37.011 --> 11:37.946
Figures.

11:42.283 --> 11:45.020
I bet all my friends are
worried sick about me.

11:47.990 --> 11:48.954
It's not bad.

11:48.956 --> 11:50.956
It could be worse, right?

11:50.958 --> 11:53.161
I mean, like, I'm
getting back to nature.

11:54.897 --> 11:57.066
I'm becoming like zen and stuff.

11:58.299 --> 12:02.038
Ugh, my feet are killing me.

12:03.905 --> 12:06.006
Wow, this is a great
location for squat videos.

12:06.008 --> 12:07.541
I mean, look at this place.

12:07.543 --> 12:09.979
I can totally make
so much content here.

12:23.091 --> 12:24.123
Oh, oh no.

12:24.125 --> 12:25.093
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

12:25.994 --> 12:27.127
Oh god.

12:27.129 --> 12:28.994
I hope there's like some,

12:28.996 --> 12:30.729
some signal up here.

12:30.731 --> 12:31.964
There's no way, oh, no way.

12:31.966 --> 12:35.035
This is, this is
not happening to me.

12:35.037 --> 12:37.737
No, this is not happening
to me right now.

12:37.739 --> 12:40.272
Come on, signal,
come on, come on!

12:40.274 --> 12:42.842
God, oh god, this can't be!

12:42.844 --> 12:45.248
Oh, oh, I'm not, no!

12:46.815 --> 12:48.047
Oh!

12:48.049 --> 12:50.016
Body, you can't do
this to me right now!

12:50.018 --> 12:52.919
Oh goodness, oh, oh, oh!

12:52.921 --> 12:54.353
How did the savages do it?

12:54.355 --> 12:55.821
Oh!

12:55.823 --> 12:57.123
I'm not gonna be
like a barbarian,

12:57.125 --> 12:59.892
but I don't think
I have any choice.

12:59.894 --> 13:01.261
Oh, what am I gonna do?

13:01.263 --> 13:03.228
Toilet paper, mm!

13:03.230 --> 13:04.066
Leaves.

13:06.902 --> 13:09.902
Okay, okay, maybe I
could use some of these.

13:09.904 --> 13:11.003
Right here, okay.

13:11.005 --> 13:12.805
Now, now I need to find a spot.

13:12.807 --> 13:14.040
Oh!

13:14.042 --> 13:15.208
I can't wait any longer!

13:15.210 --> 13:17.176
Oh, I need a spot, oh!

13:17.178 --> 13:18.011
What about right here?

13:18.013 --> 13:18.877
Yes, this looks fine.

13:18.879 --> 13:19.912
Okay, all right.

13:19.914 --> 13:20.946
Pants down.

13:20.948 --> 13:21.783
Okay.

13:35.163 --> 13:36.831
Oh, that's so good.

13:38.232 --> 13:39.366
Woo!

13:39.368 --> 13:41.001
Yes.

13:41.003 --> 13:41.935
Woo!

13:41.937 --> 13:44.103
My pants feel looser now!

13:44.105 --> 13:46.207
Oh, I feel so cleansed.

13:49.076 --> 13:51.276
I guess it's not such
a bad day after all.

13:51.278 --> 13:52.845
Feel so fresh.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.728
I once saw some TV show about
this guy in the woods and junk

14:08.730 --> 14:11.267
and he would just find stuff
that would help him survive.

14:13.268 --> 14:15.134
I wish I paid attention to it,

14:15.136 --> 14:17.036
but he was like so hot

14:17.038 --> 14:19.140
and I really didn't
understand a word he said.

14:20.241 --> 14:22.844
Hm, I wonder if I could
find him out here.

14:23.945 --> 14:25.210
Maybe I could get a ride.

14:25.212 --> 14:28.281
He's always got like a
helicopter or something.

14:28.283 --> 14:30.883
Ew, is that a spider?

14:30.885 --> 14:32.118
I hate spiders!

14:32.120 --> 14:35.121
Ugh, this place so
needs a cleaning!

14:35.123 --> 14:38.190
Where are the park maids?

14:38.192 --> 14:39.227
Ew!

14:40.128 --> 14:41.227
I hate this place!

14:41.229 --> 14:42.365
I hate nature!

14:45.332 --> 14:47.132
I wonder if this
place has bears in it.

14:47.134 --> 14:49.469
I mean, it looks
like a bear place,

14:49.471 --> 14:52.372
and if I was a bear, I'd
totally hang out here.

14:52.374 --> 14:56.108
Hey, is this where the
WeHo Bear Club hangs out?

14:56.110 --> 14:57.377
What the!

14:57.379 --> 14:59.746
You're gonna burn in
hell for what you did!

15:01.416 --> 15:03.983
Three years cardio kickboxing!

15:03.985 --> 15:06.219
Whoa, cool your jets, turbo.

15:06.221 --> 15:09.455
I, uh, was looking
for someone else.

15:09.457 --> 15:10.959
Gonna need this for later.

15:15.363 --> 15:18.263
You gonna kill some peanut
butter sandwiches with that?

15:18.265 --> 15:19.199
I lost my weapon.

15:19.201 --> 15:20.670
I woke up and it was gone, okay?

15:21.970 --> 15:23.172
I'm looking for someone.

15:24.272 --> 15:25.905
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa,

15:25.907 --> 15:27.206
whoa whoa whoa, I totally
found him like that.

15:27.208 --> 15:28.342
He was at the bottom of the hill

15:28.344 --> 15:30.243
and the blood and the rock
was already on top of him

15:30.245 --> 15:31.243
and I was totally gonna go
down there and help him out,

15:31.245 --> 15:32.911
but you know, I'm wearing
high-heel sneakers

15:32.913 --> 15:34.817
- and I can't go down there...
- Found who?

15:37.753 --> 15:38.387
Nobody.

15:39.888 --> 15:42.254
Are you the police?

15:42.256 --> 15:44.223
Police.

15:44.225 --> 15:45.324
No.

15:45.326 --> 15:48.294
I'm Homeland Security.

15:50.197 --> 15:51.033
Oh.

15:52.366 --> 15:53.201
Whew.

16:00.274 --> 16:02.108
What happened to your head?

16:02.110 --> 16:02.945
It's nothing.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.882
I'm looking for someone.

16:10.818 --> 16:12.053
Have you seen this woman?

16:13.855 --> 16:17.556
That is the worst
selfie I have ever seen.

16:17.558 --> 16:19.258
You need to learn better angles.

16:19.260 --> 16:22.328
You can make yourself look
about 10 pounds lighter.

16:22.330 --> 16:23.429
And you need a

16:32.106 --> 16:34.807
filter too because I
could totally see pores.

16:34.809 --> 16:36.111
So you haven't seen her?

16:42.350 --> 16:43.384
OMG!

16:46.221 --> 16:48.054
You get cellphone
service out here?

16:48.056 --> 16:49.525
Who is your carrier?

16:54.129 --> 16:55.261
Nassau.

16:55.263 --> 16:56.930
Are they good?

16:56.932 --> 16:57.533
Stellar.

16:58.432 --> 17:00.199
Interstellar.

17:00.201 --> 17:03.268
Because I can't get
a single bar out here.

17:03.270 --> 17:05.337
Are their roaming rates okay?

17:05.339 --> 17:07.942
Astronomical, but
we're subsidized.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.377
Wow.

17:12.512 --> 17:13.348
Excuse me.

17:19.554 --> 17:21.186
- Hm?
- Sir.

17:21.189 --> 17:22.855
My sit rep is as follows.

17:23.892 --> 17:25.924
Agent Vicky is still MIA.

17:26.894 --> 17:28.327
The package is recovered.

17:28.329 --> 17:29.295
Mm-hm.

17:29.297 --> 17:30.930
I'm wounded but able.

17:30.932 --> 17:32.899
The situation...

17:32.901 --> 17:34.267
Is FUBAR.

17:36.337 --> 17:38.304
No, no no no no no no.

17:38.306 --> 17:40.405
No, Bogley shot
down the transport.

17:40.407 --> 17:43.209
Requesting recovery team.

17:43.211 --> 17:45.111
They are everywhere!

17:47.414 --> 17:48.581
Send in Agent Radcliff.

17:51.353 --> 17:52.520
Roger that, sir.

17:56.223 --> 17:58.658
So I'm not in trouble?

17:58.660 --> 18:00.196
Are you an illegal alien?

18:01.162 --> 18:03.462
Six eyes, tentacles?

18:03.464 --> 18:04.432
I'm from Texas.

18:05.467 --> 18:06.302
Close enough.

18:10.271 --> 18:12.374
I can't believe you
get signal out here.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.546
I've been looking for
signal for like an hour.

18:21.950 --> 18:23.482
God, I wish I had some
water or something.

18:23.484 --> 18:25.485
You sound like you're
totally choking.

18:28.088 --> 18:31.490
Oh, do you think if I get
higher up the mountain,

18:31.492 --> 18:33.294
like I could get a signal there?

18:41.201 --> 18:42.434
You know what?

18:42.436 --> 18:43.538
Can I borrow your
cellphone to...

18:47.107 --> 18:48.309
Hello?

18:49.510 --> 18:50.613
So you haven't seen her?

18:51.512 --> 18:53.246
No!

18:53.248 --> 18:54.415
Creepy much?

18:56.250 --> 18:57.417
Just like I need a,

18:57.419 --> 18:59.384
I need a new phone or something.

18:59.386 --> 19:00.422
This one's terrible.

19:15.436 --> 19:18.036
Hey, do you know how to

19:18.038 --> 19:19.439
get

19:19.441 --> 19:20.442
out of here?

19:42.163 --> 19:44.564
I have
like 3.4 million followers.

19:44.566 --> 19:47.400
I have millions of likes,
collaborations, sponsorships.

19:47.402 --> 19:49.469
I spend all my
time showing people

19:49.471 --> 19:51.406
what a perfect and
sexy life I have.

19:54.209 --> 19:57.442
And I have no real friends.

19:57.444 --> 19:59.647
I don't have any real friends.

20:01.348 --> 20:03.415
I don't spend time with anyone.

20:03.417 --> 20:06.054
All my friends are
social media friends.

20:07.689 --> 20:10.055
There is literally
no one out there

20:10.057 --> 20:11.460
that gives a damn about me.

20:13.028 --> 20:14.727
If I don't upload
for a few days,

20:14.729 --> 20:16.528
everyone will
forget I even exist,

20:16.530 --> 20:19.599
and there is a new face already
poised to take my place.

20:19.601 --> 20:20.432
Uh-huh.

20:20.434 --> 20:21.601
I hate Jessica!

20:21.603 --> 20:23.471
Her makeup is
always so on point!

20:24.705 --> 20:27.440
Well, sure she looks
like ass in real life

20:27.442 --> 20:29.307
without all her filters.

20:29.309 --> 20:30.776
Totally met her at a meetup,

20:30.778 --> 20:33.513
and I laughed so
hard when I saw her.

20:33.515 --> 20:34.616
What a dumb hoe.

20:36.050 --> 20:37.616
She shouldn't show
her face in public

20:37.618 --> 20:40.353
when she uses all those tricks
to make her skin all flawless

20:40.355 --> 20:43.623
and all those camera angles to
make herself look all skinny.

20:43.625 --> 20:46.124
She is a walking lie,

20:46.126 --> 20:49.194
and I can't even post
that pic of me and Jake.

20:49.196 --> 20:50.496
R.I.P.

20:50.498 --> 20:51.567
He was so lit.

20:53.367 --> 20:56.235
I am so hungry.

20:56.237 --> 20:58.336
If I don't eat
something like soon,

20:58.338 --> 21:00.672
I'll start losing
all my booty gains.

21:00.674 --> 21:01.710
Bag of dicks.

21:04.511 --> 21:06.578
Oh, mushrooms.

21:06.580 --> 21:10.248
Non-GMO, gluten-free, and
totally organic, right?

21:10.250 --> 21:12.117
I mean, you can't
get much fresher

21:12.119 --> 21:14.055
than straight out of
the forest, right?

21:15.289 --> 21:17.155
Smells like shiitake.

21:17.157 --> 21:19.292
I, I wish I could look it up.

21:19.294 --> 21:20.162
Dammit!

21:22.564 --> 21:24.497
Well, what if I just try one?

21:24.499 --> 21:27.266
I can always make
myself throw up, right?

21:27.268 --> 21:28.767
I'm like great at vomit.

21:28.769 --> 21:30.436
I practiced in high school.

21:30.438 --> 21:32.738
No way Suzie Baker was
gonna be thinner than me.

21:32.740 --> 21:34.242
That bitch.

21:40.414 --> 21:43.115
Hm, tastes pretty good.

21:43.117 --> 21:45.884
I'm like so paleo right now.

21:45.886 --> 21:48.557
Just like that raw vegan
place I tried last month.

21:50.357 --> 21:53.628
Ugh, I'm like a total
savage barbarian right now.

23:58.786 --> 23:59.788
Oh!

24:02.423 --> 24:03.258
A unicorn.

24:06.861 --> 24:08.864
Take me to that rainbow.

24:55.410 --> 24:56.245
Whoa!

24:56.978 --> 24:58.346
Pretty colors!

25:01.648 --> 25:03.315
Get out of the way!

25:04.484 --> 25:05.817
You're gonna get
yourself killed!

25:10.991 --> 25:14.326
Do you know how to get
to grandma's house?

25:14.328 --> 25:16.895
I don't know where
your grandma is.

25:20.535 --> 25:21.566
What's wrong with you?

25:21.568 --> 25:22.903
Did you eat something out here?

25:25.839 --> 25:26.771
Are you hungry?

25:26.773 --> 25:28.542
I have muffins and cookies.

25:31.712 --> 25:32.780
Uh,

25:33.881 --> 25:35.450
I only

25:37.785 --> 25:39.785
eat gluten-free cookies.

25:39.787 --> 25:41.757
Give those to your grandma.

25:52.866 --> 25:53.902
Um...

25:58.905 --> 26:02.040
Hey Mister Wolf, did
you see what I just saw?

26:02.042 --> 26:03.843
Was that Little Red Riding Hood?

26:03.845 --> 26:05.811
It
sure was, Barbi.

26:05.813 --> 26:08.413
I think that was
Little Red Riding Hood.

26:08.415 --> 26:09.849
What do you think?

26:09.851 --> 26:12.817
You're far
more delicious though.

26:47.555 --> 26:49.858
Have you seen Agent Mahoney?

26:51.592 --> 26:53.659
Tall, bald, glasses.

26:53.661 --> 26:55.997
The better to see me with!

27:21.154 --> 27:23.759
They must have no vision
in the pink spectrum!

28:23.017 --> 28:24.085
They can't see pink.

28:37.097 --> 28:39.097
Sir, I have discovered a
fault in their technology.

28:52.813 --> 28:54.880
It can change the course
of our whole battle.

28:55.982 --> 28:57.783
Alert Agent Radcliff that
the aliens cannot see pink.

29:03.156 --> 29:04.492
Oh, pretty!

29:22.809 --> 29:24.977
Okay,
I'm starting to suspect

29:24.979 --> 29:26.812
that those were not
gluten-free mushrooms,

29:26.814 --> 29:28.846
because I haven't
tripped balls like this

29:28.848 --> 29:31.115
since that weekend freshman
year in the Hamptons

29:31.117 --> 29:33.754
when Jessica stole my
first serious boyfriend.

29:35.288 --> 29:37.655
What was his name again?

29:37.657 --> 29:41.326
I mean, we were like totally
destined to be together.

29:41.328 --> 29:43.728
He was so rough and tough,

29:43.730 --> 29:46.100
just like a hot barbarian.

29:47.167 --> 29:49.969
I would've given him
so many followers,

29:49.971 --> 29:53.107
but he chose Jessica and
all he got was herpes.

29:54.808 --> 29:57.042
OMG, is that him,

29:57.044 --> 29:58.146
what's-his-nuts?

29:59.380 --> 30:02.046
He looks so much
better in a loincloth.

30:05.185 --> 30:07.054
Antibiotics do wonders.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.857
Check out this cute outfit.

30:12.859 --> 30:15.628
I have a sword, armored boobs!

30:15.630 --> 30:17.062
Looking good, Barbi.

30:19.900 --> 30:20.735
Hm.

30:22.336 --> 30:24.103
This looks sharp.

30:24.105 --> 30:26.575
This hallucination
is like so lit.

30:28.843 --> 30:30.209
That's right.

30:30.211 --> 30:31.376
Sploosh.

30:31.378 --> 30:34.046
You're gonna need a lot more
water to put out this fire.

30:34.048 --> 30:35.146
Mm-hm.

30:35.148 --> 30:38.083
Man, my abs look amazing.

30:38.085 --> 30:39.317
Why
did we break up again?

30:39.319 --> 30:41.056
I totally can't remember.

30:43.156 --> 30:45.024
I bet she wants me.

30:45.026 --> 30:46.290
If
this gets any hotter,

30:46.292 --> 30:48.192
I'm gonna need a boat.

30:50.431 --> 30:52.197
Check it, uh-huh.

30:52.199 --> 30:54.298
Call that a sword?

30:54.300 --> 30:56.971
I'll
call it anything you want.

30:59.874 --> 31:01.675
Wait, what just happened?

31:03.344 --> 31:04.776
BARBARIAN
VOICEOVER: Mm, baby!

31:04.778 --> 31:05.811
Wait, what?

31:07.948 --> 31:09.250
Hail to the king.

31:10.884 --> 31:13.121
Well
this escalated quickly.

31:14.387 --> 31:15.789
Oh, he's serious.

31:18.025 --> 31:20.159
Maybe he means
somebody back there.

31:20.161 --> 31:22.061
Nope, just me.

31:22.063 --> 31:24.462
Well, I didn't get
all fantasy dressed up

31:24.464 --> 31:26.731
for nothing, I guess.

31:26.733 --> 31:28.232
And I have this sword,

31:28.234 --> 31:31.005
so my brain must've known
something like this would happen.

31:32.772 --> 31:35.074
Gonna make her work for it.

31:36.042 --> 31:37.645
This chick's gonna ruin my pump!

31:39.046 --> 31:41.246
Your
pump looks just fine to me.

31:41.248 --> 31:42.346
I could totally take him.

31:42.348 --> 31:44.216
I know what he likes.

31:45.452 --> 31:46.788
She slapped my ass.

31:48.756 --> 31:50.055
I kinda like it.

31:50.057 --> 31:52.157
Oh,
we're still doing this.

31:54.494 --> 31:57.129
When did foreplay
become so hard?

32:00.500 --> 32:01.432
- I
- knew I shouldn't have taken

32:01.434 --> 32:03.235
my pre-workout pill early.

32:05.506 --> 32:06.438
I'm so glad

32:06.440 --> 32:08.006
I've been doing yoga classes.

32:08.008 --> 32:10.241
They really keep
me nice and loose.

32:10.243 --> 32:11.744
I can totally hold my own.

32:11.746 --> 32:12.978
I always could.

32:12.980 --> 32:16.148
Not to mention I look
amazing with this hand.

32:16.150 --> 32:17.015
- I
- wonder if she saw that lion

32:17.017 --> 32:18.449
that I killed last week.

32:18.451 --> 32:19.287
Oh, yeah.

32:22.088 --> 32:23.087
What I
love about this fantasy is that

32:23.089 --> 32:26.892
Jessica would never look
as good as I do in this.

32:26.894 --> 32:30.027
I mean, have you
seen this hotness?

32:30.029 --> 32:31.863
Man,
that's a nice loincloth.

32:31.865 --> 32:33.465
I wonder if she's
wearing underwear.

32:33.467 --> 32:34.369
Wait, am I?

32:36.269 --> 32:37.536
This barbarian fantasy

32:37.538 --> 32:40.972
is so much better
than the light show.

32:42.308 --> 32:43.344
Ha, gotcha!

32:44.478 --> 32:48.212
But
that was my favorite sword.

32:48.214 --> 32:49.250
Aw.

32:50.217 --> 32:51.219
I'm sad.

32:54.221 --> 32:55.853
Oh come on!

32:55.855 --> 32:57.288
You're finished already?

32:57.290 --> 32:58.990
But I'm not done yet!

32:58.992 --> 33:00.258
- I
- don't wanna fight you anyway.

33:00.260 --> 33:01.126
I can get your sword.

33:01.128 --> 33:02.295
- It's like right there.
- Stupid girl.

33:02.297 --> 33:04.162
I'll give
you a hand and everything.

33:04.164 --> 33:05.363
I'll go get it for you.

33:08.201 --> 33:09.203
Wait, come back!

33:10.238 --> 33:12.938
Ugh, it's like high
school prom all over again

33:12.940 --> 33:15.340
except I'm not fat anymore.

33:15.342 --> 33:19.147
Ugh, things get rough and he
goes crying to his mother.

33:21.147 --> 33:23.815
And now it's just me
left behind with a rabbit

33:23.817 --> 33:25.052
and no batteries.

33:27.253 --> 33:29.254
Ugh, now I remember the problem.

33:29.256 --> 33:30.988
He's too into himself,

33:30.990 --> 33:32.891
all pump and no go.

33:32.893 --> 33:35.262
Jessica can totally
keep him, blech.

33:36.497 --> 33:39.331
All those muscles spending
hours at the gym, for what?

33:39.333 --> 33:40.465
And then he dumps me.

33:40.467 --> 33:41.900
Me!

33:41.902 --> 33:44.335
I mean, have you seen
how hot I look now?

33:44.337 --> 33:46.904
Most people would
hallucinate being a superhero

33:46.906 --> 33:48.140
or a ballerina.

33:48.142 --> 33:49.908
Me, oh no.

33:49.910 --> 33:53.178
What is my subconscious
trying to tell me?

33:53.180 --> 33:54.345
Worst

33:54.347 --> 33:56.113
fantasy

33:56.115 --> 33:56.917
ever.

35:15.094 --> 35:15.929
Pretty.

37:14.614 --> 37:17.749
Why'd you pop my balloons?

37:18.284 --> 37:20.087
I'm gonna kill you, bitch!

37:21.121 --> 37:21.820
Oh my god!

37:21.822 --> 37:23.655
Oh my god, oh my god!

37:24.824 --> 37:26.724
This cannot be my life!

37:26.726 --> 37:27.726
A monster, really?

37:27.728 --> 37:28.793
Slow down, bitch!

37:30.496 --> 37:31.463
I'm tired!

37:31.465 --> 37:33.264
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

37:41.708 --> 37:43.374
It's all right.

37:43.376 --> 37:44.708
- You good?
- Mm-hm.

37:44.710 --> 37:46.110
We're good.

37:46.112 --> 37:46.744
We're good.

37:46.746 --> 37:48.512
Okay.

37:48.514 --> 37:51.184
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

37:54.621 --> 37:57.488
Oh my god, he's
swinging an ax at me!

38:03.697 --> 38:06.233
I'm gonna kill you, bitch!

38:07.501 --> 38:09.434
You're such a dead little bitch!

38:12.606 --> 38:14.106
You're such a dead little bitch!

38:21.648 --> 38:23.818
I'm gonna kill you, bitch!

38:28.588 --> 38:29.590
Oh my god!

38:30.556 --> 38:32.224
Oh my god!

38:32.226 --> 38:36.193
Where am I gonna get
another balloon out here?

38:37.463 --> 38:38.295
No!

38:38.297 --> 38:39.566
Leave me alone!

38:43.769 --> 38:47.671
Where am I gonna get
another balloon out here?

38:47.673 --> 38:50.610
Party supply
stores for clowns!

40:08.688 --> 40:09.923
That was crazy.

40:12.291 --> 40:13.657
Say a command.

40:13.659 --> 40:15.327
Call home.

40:15.329 --> 40:17.628
- Hi, honey.
- Honey, yeah.

40:17.630 --> 40:20.467
Hey so, I just pulled
over to take a quick leak.

40:21.635 --> 40:22.467
Unbelievable.

40:22.469 --> 40:23.635
You wouldn't believe.

40:23.637 --> 40:25.737
There was a chick,
a blonde chick,

40:25.739 --> 40:27.639
tripping balls
out in the forest,

40:27.641 --> 40:29.840
like losing her freaking mind.

40:29.842 --> 40:32.543
- Drugs?
- Yeah yeah, I know, right?

40:32.545 --> 40:33.345
Kids today.

40:33.347 --> 40:35.516
I mean, ugh, kids.

40:38.784 --> 40:40.651
Oh no, why is he chasing me!

41:18.525 --> 41:19.360
Shh!

41:44.518 --> 41:45.318
Ow.

42:17.451 --> 42:18.286
What?

42:28.961 --> 42:29.797
Oh my god!

42:58.391 --> 42:59.090
Yes!

43:01.594 --> 43:02.429
Oh, yes!

43:03.797 --> 43:04.729
Oh!

44:54.574 --> 44:56.110
No no no no no no no!

44:57.744 --> 44:58.579
No!

45:01.014 --> 45:02.016
No!

45:04.251 --> 45:05.619
No, don't die!

45:09.222 --> 45:10.854
Fresh and clean.

45:10.856 --> 45:14.025
Nothing like a morning shower
in natural springwater.

45:14.027 --> 45:15.994
Is this what my parents
were talking about

45:15.996 --> 45:18.829
when they lived in that hippie
commune back in the '80s?

45:18.831 --> 45:21.766
I think they wore like
jogging suits or something.

45:21.768 --> 45:24.001
Hm, something feels weird.

45:24.003 --> 45:26.838
Were there way too many
minerals in the water?

45:26.840 --> 45:28.805
Maybe I need some
lotion or something.

45:28.807 --> 45:30.208
My neck is feeling kinda itchy.

45:33.947 --> 45:35.280
Focus, Barbi.

45:35.282 --> 45:37.084
It's just all in your head.

45:38.284 --> 45:39.784
Maybe I didn't sleep off

45:39.786 --> 45:41.853
all the effects from
those mushrooms.

45:41.855 --> 45:44.655
No, I'm definitely feeling
something back there.

45:44.657 --> 45:45.956
Where's my mirror?

45:45.958 --> 45:46.993
Let's see.

45:49.128 --> 45:51.128
Are those my pores?

45:51.130 --> 45:51.929
Ugh!

45:51.931 --> 45:54.132
I totally need some
new foundation.

45:54.134 --> 45:56.135
Maybe a waterproof
one or something.

45:57.137 --> 45:59.874
Better, I mean, not bad
for the savage wild.

46:00.673 --> 46:01.940
I wonder where I am.

46:01.942 --> 46:04.575
I've been walking
nonstop for hours.

46:04.577 --> 46:05.976
I wish I was
tracking my calories.

46:05.978 --> 46:09.048
My calorie burn must
be off the charts.

46:11.150 --> 46:13.119
Ugh, what is this
freaking itching!

46:15.021 --> 46:17.091
Did I touch some poison
ivy or something?

46:18.090 --> 46:19.724
I have a photo shoot next week,

46:19.726 --> 46:21.159
and if I'm still alive,

46:21.161 --> 46:23.994
I can't have a rash I
can't cover up with makeup.

46:23.996 --> 46:25.095
Wait, what the hell is this?

46:25.097 --> 46:27.867
Fuzzy, pointy, it's moving.

46:56.362 --> 46:57.196
Spider.

48:29.255 --> 48:31.025
Oh, you're awake.

48:32.858 --> 48:33.693
Yeah.

48:35.295 --> 48:37.295
What happened?

48:37.297 --> 48:38.229
You slipped and fell.

48:38.231 --> 48:39.767
Lucky I was there to catch you.

48:41.300 --> 48:42.467
Wow.

48:42.469 --> 48:44.235
I could've died.

48:44.237 --> 48:45.802
Yeah, I know.

48:45.804 --> 48:48.174
Pretty amazing, right?

48:54.280 --> 48:55.278
Kenny Radcliff, ma'am.

48:55.280 --> 48:56.313
Barbi Radcliff.

48:56.315 --> 48:57.150
I mean, Brennan.

49:00.018 --> 49:02.021
Oh, sorry, I went
through your bag.

49:03.956 --> 49:05.222
You were out of water

49:05.224 --> 49:07.258
so I gave you a refill
and some food rations.

49:07.260 --> 49:08.458
And a ring.

49:08.460 --> 49:09.894
You mean a ring.

49:09.896 --> 49:13.063
OMG, OMG, OMG, it's
really happening!

49:13.065 --> 49:17.200
I'm gonna be the next
Mrs. Barbi Kenny Radcliff!

49:17.202 --> 49:20.204
I'm not gonna die alone
in my house with 10 cats

49:20.206 --> 49:24.242
who will eat my eyes after
I'm dead like my mom said!

49:24.244 --> 49:27.979
It's so beautiful!

49:27.981 --> 49:30.180
I'm gonna get this
appraised right away.

49:30.182 --> 49:32.182
What is this, like 100 carats?

49:32.184 --> 49:33.117
I'm so worth it.

49:37.289 --> 49:38.291
My precious!

49:39.826 --> 49:41.327
Take that, Jessica!

49:42.461 --> 49:44.864
Thank you very much.

49:47.333 --> 49:48.900
You should probably
stick to the trails.

49:48.902 --> 49:49.534
Trails?

49:49.536 --> 49:50.834
What trails?

49:50.836 --> 49:53.271
I'm totally lost.

49:53.273 --> 49:54.838
In more ways than one.

49:54.840 --> 49:56.072
- Huh?
- Oh, nothing.

49:56.074 --> 49:57.210
Are you out here alone?

50:00.146 --> 50:00.981
Sort of.

50:03.349 --> 50:05.048
Well if you hike that way
for about a mile and a half,

50:29.976 --> 50:31.141
you'll come across the road.

50:31.143 --> 50:32.543
Sooner or later the ranger
will come by and pick you up,

50:32.545 --> 50:33.347
get you home.

50:35.849 --> 50:37.084
Are you coming?

50:38.284 --> 50:39.253
No.

50:40.420 --> 50:41.952
I've got unfinished business.

50:44.056 --> 50:46.325
Oh, so you go that way?

50:52.231 --> 50:53.465
Hello?

50:53.467 --> 50:54.032
I really
need to start paying attention

50:54.034 --> 50:56.066
when people talk to me.

50:56.068 --> 50:58.269
It's just so rare that I
actually talk to someone

50:58.271 --> 50:59.936
face to face, you know?

50:59.938 --> 51:01.905
It's so much easier
to text them.

51:01.907 --> 51:06.209
Hm, maybe my people skills
are somehow lacking.

51:06.211 --> 51:07.912
Like, if I listened
to Kenny's directions,

51:07.914 --> 51:09.817
maybe I'd already
be home by now.

51:11.284 --> 51:14.117
Wait, is that someone there?

51:14.119 --> 51:16.253
Maybe they know where I am.

51:16.255 --> 51:17.521
She looks familiar.

51:17.523 --> 51:19.590
Where have I seen her before?

51:19.592 --> 51:21.525
Does she do hair tutorials?

51:26.965 --> 51:28.432
Help me!

51:28.434 --> 51:30.066
Maybe she
knows where to get signals

51:30.068 --> 51:32.271
so I can find Kenny
and swipe right.

51:33.672 --> 51:36.240
Excuse me, excuse me.

51:36.242 --> 51:38.208
Do you know how to
get out of here?

51:42.414 --> 51:45.485
Oh my god, what is that smell?

51:48.121 --> 51:49.452
Oh, thank god!

51:49.454 --> 51:50.320
Help me!

51:50.322 --> 51:51.688
My arm is crushed!

51:51.690 --> 51:53.292
Hey, are you okay?

51:54.193 --> 51:56.026
Help me, I'm stuck!

52:04.436 --> 52:05.970
What happened?

52:07.373 --> 52:08.171
My arm's
crushed, I can't move it!

52:08.173 --> 52:09.307
Oh that looks bad.

52:09.309 --> 52:12.510
Your dry-cleaner is never
gonna get that out, honey.

52:12.512 --> 52:14.211
I know, right?

52:14.213 --> 52:15.315
Now can you help me?

52:18.650 --> 52:21.120
What is that stench?

52:23.422 --> 52:26.691
The effervescent scent
of the great outdoors.

52:26.693 --> 52:29.427
Hey, were you gonna
cut your arm off?

52:29.429 --> 52:31.228
Yeah, duh.

52:31.230 --> 52:32.432
I can't take it anymore!

52:33.599 --> 52:35.266
I know, right?

52:35.268 --> 52:37.336
I would totally kill myself
if I had to smell this.

52:39.237 --> 52:40.239
What happened?

52:41.606 --> 52:43.007
I was in a plane crash.

52:43.009 --> 52:43.974
Didn't you see?

52:43.976 --> 52:45.008
What plane crash?

52:45.010 --> 52:46.476
Oh never mind.

52:46.478 --> 52:47.311
A little help here?

52:47.313 --> 52:49.012
Oh, sorry.

52:54.387 --> 52:55.389
What's that?

52:56.521 --> 52:58.088
Uh, nothing.

52:58.090 --> 52:59.023
Don't worry about it.

52:59.025 --> 53:00.157
Get me outta here!

53:00.159 --> 53:00.724
Uh, hold on.

53:00.726 --> 53:02.092
Wait, wait.

53:04.697 --> 53:06.396
Is that a dead body?

53:10.003 --> 53:11.505
You gotta
be kidding me.

53:17.309 --> 53:18.508
Ew!

53:18.510 --> 53:20.411
It is a dead body!

53:20.413 --> 53:23.546
Oh, and it looks like someone
beat the crap out of it.

53:23.548 --> 53:25.518
What happened to him?

53:27.085 --> 53:28.552
The same thing
that'll happen to you

53:28.554 --> 53:31.655
if you don't get me out of here.

53:31.657 --> 53:34.361
You're totally freaking
me out right now.

53:35.561 --> 53:37.965
Haven't you ever seen
a dead body before?

53:40.532 --> 53:42.268
Recently?

53:43.402 --> 53:44.668
Uh-huh.

53:44.670 --> 53:45.639
Who is this?

53:46.672 --> 53:48.472
I'm gonna die here.

53:49.307 --> 53:50.143
The dead body.

53:52.445 --> 53:53.778
My boss.

53:53.780 --> 53:56.280
Might've had a
slight disagreement

53:56.282 --> 53:58.684
over a small financial sum.

54:00.385 --> 54:04.121
Hey, you can't take
that, those are state secrets!

54:11.197 --> 54:13.200
No, you can't stop me!

54:14.233 --> 54:15.499
Cut you.

54:15.501 --> 54:16.333
Give me it back.

54:16.335 --> 54:17.168
I'm gonna cut you!

54:17.170 --> 54:18.302
Give me it back!

54:24.844 --> 54:27.845
There was a rock slide,
but that came after,

54:27.847 --> 54:29.316
and now I'm here!

54:31.516 --> 54:32.483
Oh.

54:32.485 --> 54:34.584
Okay. Well do you know
how to get out of here?

54:34.586 --> 54:36.487
Can you please
help me already?

54:36.489 --> 54:38.456
All right already, gosh!

54:38.458 --> 54:40.825
It's all about you, isn't it?

54:45.498 --> 54:47.530
Oh, there's no way
I'm gonna move this.

54:47.532 --> 54:49.432
And honey, I'm not
cutting your arm off.

54:49.434 --> 54:50.767
That would be way too messy,

54:50.769 --> 54:53.340
and have you seen this
outfit that I'm wearing?

54:54.239 --> 54:56.507
Just get that stick over there

54:56.509 --> 54:59.679
and use it like a lever
to move the rocks.

55:01.713 --> 55:03.482
Oh!

55:08.554 --> 55:09.389
Will this do?

55:11.824 --> 55:13.427
That's too heavy.

55:14.693 --> 55:17.697
Can you please hurry it up!

55:18.831 --> 55:20.767
All right, all
right already, gosh!

55:33.146 --> 55:34.314
That's good.

55:37.617 --> 55:38.452
What the?

55:42.822 --> 55:44.257
Where'd she go?

55:54.333 --> 55:57.233
Why does this keep
happening to me?

55:58.704 --> 55:59.739
Oh god.

56:00.706 --> 56:02.675
Why is this always so...

56:06.878 --> 56:08.778
What was that about?

56:13.518 --> 56:14.517
Okay, that was weird.

56:14.519 --> 56:17.487
Hair tutorial girl just
vanished into the forest

56:17.489 --> 56:20.624
and now I'm left with
a dead farting body.

56:20.626 --> 56:22.626
It looks so familiar.

56:22.628 --> 56:25.396
Meh, probably just
my imagination.

56:25.398 --> 56:28.932
What I need to do is
center, regroup my thoughts.

56:28.934 --> 56:30.601
I might be seeing things again.

56:30.603 --> 56:35.472
Man, those mushrooms have
some gnarly acid flashbacks.

56:35.474 --> 56:37.740
Okay, I need to calm my mind.

56:37.742 --> 56:39.309
I need a zen moment.

56:39.311 --> 56:40.610
I am a woman,

56:40.612 --> 56:41.744
hear me roar.

56:45.617 --> 56:47.985
Okay, that was in
my head, right?

56:47.987 --> 56:48.822
Okay.

56:52.824 --> 56:54.391
I am a woman,

56:54.393 --> 56:55.693
hear me roar.

57:08.673 --> 57:10.807
So much for tranquility.

57:10.809 --> 57:13.309
And here I was thinking
I could reach nirvana,

57:13.311 --> 57:15.915
like that one time in that
hot yoga class I tried.

57:38.838 --> 57:40.507
And now we're all caught up.

57:43.675 --> 57:45.842
I'm getting pretty good
at this survival thing.

57:45.844 --> 57:48.345
I just wish I had some
pre-workout with me.

57:48.347 --> 57:50.817
Ugh, I miss my
Wow Force protein.

57:52.918 --> 57:54.584
But look at me!

57:54.586 --> 57:56.686
I'm getting better at
this free-climbing thing.

57:56.688 --> 57:58.856
I'm even starting to enjoy it.

57:58.858 --> 58:00.291
I just wish I brought something

58:00.293 --> 58:01.858
other than high heel
sneakers with me,

58:01.860 --> 58:04.827
but then this outfit
would not look this cute.

58:04.829 --> 58:06.563
I have this funny feeling

58:06.565 --> 58:08.768
that I might've taken the
long way up this mountain.

58:10.869 --> 58:12.672
But maybe there's
a signal up there!

58:14.706 --> 58:17.441
There has got to be
some signal somewhere

58:17.443 --> 58:19.512
in this nature's bag of dicks.

58:21.780 --> 58:25.682
This fast at cardio is the bomb!

58:25.684 --> 58:29.019
Damn, that was
the ultimate burn!

58:29.021 --> 58:31.755
Leg day, smashed!

58:39.764 --> 58:41.498
Oh my god, I can't breathe.

58:41.500 --> 58:42.599
I can't breathe,
I can't breathe!

58:42.601 --> 58:44.037
I can't breathe,
I can't breathe!

58:52.110 --> 58:53.543
Whew.

58:53.545 --> 58:54.744
Ugh, much better.

58:54.746 --> 58:58.414
I think I've set some of record
for wearing a waist trainer.

58:58.416 --> 58:59.883
I need a break.

58:59.885 --> 59:02.589
That mountain was a little
rough for my complexion.

59:03.856 --> 59:05.558
I'm either gonna be glowing or

59:06.891 --> 59:08.891
I'm gonna need some
industrial strength facials

59:08.893 --> 59:10.728
when I get out of here.

59:10.730 --> 59:11.563
I mean,

59:14.900 --> 59:16.766
I don't think there's any
dirt left on the ground.

59:16.768 --> 59:19.436
It's like all in my pores!

59:19.438 --> 59:21.871
Luckily I'm prepared for this.

59:21.873 --> 59:25.675
My Super Mega Pore Suck mud
mask should do the trick.

59:25.677 --> 59:26.876
Just need a place to sit down

59:26.878 --> 59:28.612
and do a little spa treatment.

59:28.614 --> 59:31.650
You know, it's all about
personal care and hygiene.

59:43.829 --> 59:44.961
Good thing I'm all
alone out here.

59:44.963 --> 59:48.132
I mean, if someone sees me
like this, I would just...

59:48.134 --> 59:50.099
Die, you faceless
form of a space alien!

59:50.101 --> 59:50.903
Whoa, whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa, it's me!

59:53.972 --> 59:55.072
Shit.

59:55.074 --> 59:56.773
Didn't recognize you.

59:56.775 --> 59:58.175
Almost blew your face off.

59:58.177 --> 59:59.913
I'm doing a little
spa treatment.

01:00:01.079 --> 01:00:02.945
Yeah. Maybe I should
blow your face off.

01:00:02.947 --> 01:00:04.815
Your pores were looking
horrible back there.

01:00:04.817 --> 01:00:05.885
I know, right?

01:00:07.619 --> 01:00:09.688
It's all about personal
care and hygiene.

01:00:10.889 --> 01:00:13.123
What the hell are you
still doing here anyway?

01:00:16.061 --> 01:00:18.162
I told you how to
get out of here.

01:00:18.164 --> 01:00:20.197
I followed all your
directions to the letter

01:00:20.199 --> 01:00:22.802
and here I am.

01:00:25.871 --> 01:00:27.704
We need to get
out of here, now.

01:00:27.706 --> 01:00:29.972
What are you thinking,
cocktails, dancing?

01:00:29.974 --> 01:00:31.874
No, we need ex-fill ASAP.

01:00:31.876 --> 01:00:33.543
Are they a band, they new?

01:00:33.545 --> 01:00:34.711
Never heard of them.

01:00:44.023 --> 01:00:44.923
Oh Jesus.

01:00:49.494 --> 01:00:52.931
That's not exactly a
hunting rifle you got there.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.668
No, it's not.

01:00:57.068 --> 01:00:59.873
You mean you're not
hiking or hunting?

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.206
Oh, I'm hunting.

01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:04.842
I just hope I get it
before it gets me.

01:01:16.621 --> 01:01:17.554
What
the hell, what the hell,

01:01:17.556 --> 01:01:18.155
what the hell, what the hell!

01:01:18.157 --> 01:01:19.021
I gotta get outta here!

01:01:19.023 --> 01:01:21.057
I hate the outdoors!

01:01:27.666 --> 01:01:29.999
OMG, what should I do?
What do I do, what do I do,

01:01:30.001 --> 01:01:31.501
what do I do, what do I do!

01:01:31.503 --> 01:01:33.135
He's like an outdoorsy guy.

01:01:33.137 --> 01:01:34.537
Wait, should I help him?

01:01:34.539 --> 01:01:35.805
Nah, he's fine, he's
fine, he's fine.

01:01:35.807 --> 01:01:37.641
I think I'm just
gonna get in the way.

01:01:37.643 --> 01:01:39.141
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah.

01:01:39.143 --> 01:01:40.943
I'll just text him later.

01:01:40.945 --> 01:01:41.780
He got this.

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.046
What was that?

01:01:44.048 --> 01:01:46.717
That had to be some
mutant bear lion octopus.

01:01:46.719 --> 01:01:48.251
Six eyes, tentacles.

01:01:48.253 --> 01:01:50.220
The water must be
totally contaminated

01:01:50.222 --> 01:01:51.722
out here or something.

01:01:51.724 --> 01:01:53.090
My mother was right,

01:01:53.092 --> 01:01:57.059
I am gonna die a
lonely spinster!

01:01:57.061 --> 01:01:59.162
Well at least my
pores are glowing now.

01:01:59.164 --> 01:02:00.264
Not that it matters.

01:02:03.635 --> 01:02:05.936
Oh look, a cave!

01:02:05.938 --> 01:02:09.776
What possible dangers
can lurk inside here?

01:02:10.943 --> 01:02:13.744
Ugh, it doesn't matter
anymore anyway, does it?

01:02:13.746 --> 01:02:16.179
I'm alone, again!

01:02:16.181 --> 01:02:18.548
Just like my whole life!

01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:19.849
I miss my phone!

01:02:19.851 --> 01:02:23.086
Just holding it
makes me feel better!

01:02:23.088 --> 01:02:25.692
I'm severed from the collective!

01:02:26.858 --> 01:02:28.958
I'm never gonna find my
way out of here, am I?

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:33.030
There will be stories
of the lonely crazy lady

01:02:33.032 --> 01:02:35.666
who lives up in the
cave in the mountains.

01:02:35.668 --> 01:02:38.137
It'll be used to scare
children at night.

01:02:39.271 --> 01:02:40.938
I'll just stop
shaving, plucking,

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:43.072
and just let everything go.

01:02:43.074 --> 01:02:44.874
I'll eat pasta,
doughnuts, pizza,

01:02:44.876 --> 01:02:47.844
stop doing squats and let
my abs get all flabby.

01:02:47.846 --> 01:02:50.847
I mean, who do I need
to look good for?

01:02:50.849 --> 01:02:54.717
My whole love life
has just been a mess.

01:02:54.719 --> 01:02:57.220
All I wanted was
to find a nice guy,

01:02:57.222 --> 01:02:59.590
someone who will love me.

01:02:59.592 --> 01:03:01.825
But who is the real me?

01:03:01.827 --> 01:03:04.026
I'm not exactly a good person.

01:03:04.028 --> 01:03:07.197
I mean, I just left
that guy to die.

01:03:07.199 --> 01:03:08.932
He was out there screaming,

01:03:08.934 --> 01:03:11.802
and I just kinda ran away,

01:03:11.804 --> 01:03:13.269
not to mention poor Jake.

01:03:13.271 --> 01:03:17.740
I have like the worst luck ever.

01:03:17.742 --> 01:03:18.941
Now that I've seen
more of the world,

01:03:18.943 --> 01:03:22.713
I guess it's not so important
to have a million followers.

01:03:22.715 --> 01:03:26.215
Kenny's probably some
special forces black ops guy

01:03:26.217 --> 01:03:29.786
who doesn't even have a
real identity, like my dad.

01:03:29.788 --> 01:03:33.190
He's not even online
and he's still hot.

01:03:33.192 --> 01:03:36.092
Hot guys without social media?

01:03:36.094 --> 01:03:38.061
Is that even possible?

01:03:38.063 --> 01:03:39.729
Poor Kenny and Jake.

01:03:39.731 --> 01:03:44.737
OMG, does this make
me like a black widow?

01:03:45.103 --> 01:03:46.135
R.I.P.

01:03:46.137 --> 01:03:47.806
They were so lit.

01:03:58.317 --> 01:04:00.416
Huh?

01:04:00.418 --> 01:04:03.088
Ah, it was a dream.

01:04:04.289 --> 01:04:05.121
Ugh.

01:04:05.123 --> 01:04:06.992
Oh, thank goodness.

01:04:12.998 --> 01:04:16.001
Oh, hello room, I've missed you.

01:04:24.076 --> 01:04:25.010
Still got it.

01:04:27.945 --> 01:04:28.780
Mm!

01:05:41.052 --> 01:05:41.887
Hello?

01:05:43.422 --> 01:05:46.192
Hello, daughter
of the universe.

01:05:48.193 --> 01:05:50.260
My mom's name is Diane.

01:05:50.262 --> 01:05:53.162
We are all children
of the universe.

01:05:53.164 --> 01:05:55.132
No need to worry.

01:05:55.134 --> 01:05:57.200
Nothing happens randomly.

01:05:57.202 --> 01:06:00.273
There is a divine
path to everything.

01:06:01.139 --> 01:06:03.076
We are all but stardust.

01:06:04.208 --> 01:06:05.342
Uh-huh.

01:06:05.344 --> 01:06:07.209
The paths you have chosen

01:06:07.211 --> 01:06:10.349
and the decisions you've
made led you here.

01:06:12.416 --> 01:06:13.983
Uh-huh.

01:06:13.985 --> 01:06:15.452
And what have
you learned so far

01:06:15.454 --> 01:06:17.090
from your journey, my child?

01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:20.990
Not to wear high-heeled
sneakers while hiking.

01:06:20.992 --> 01:06:23.260
Well, that's a start.

01:06:23.262 --> 01:06:25.364
But what have you
learned with your heart?

01:06:26.831 --> 01:06:29.032
Not to lie on
my dating profile.

01:06:29.034 --> 01:06:30.534
Closer.

01:06:30.536 --> 01:06:33.235
Think beyond here.

01:06:33.237 --> 01:06:34.436
I don't know.

01:06:34.438 --> 01:06:36.907
I've seen some ratchet
shit out there.

01:06:36.909 --> 01:06:38.809
You have questions.

01:06:38.811 --> 01:06:40.543
Yeah, how do I
get out of here?

01:06:40.545 --> 01:06:42.813
Excellent question.

01:06:42.815 --> 01:06:44.815
The body is just a mortal coil

01:06:44.817 --> 01:06:46.416
that we're all trapped in.

01:06:46.418 --> 01:06:48.083
But if you free your mind,

01:06:48.085 --> 01:06:51.987
it will flow with the
energy of the universe.

01:06:51.989 --> 01:06:54.124
I can teach you
ancient techniques.

01:06:54.126 --> 01:06:57.427
No, no, I mean how
do I get out of here?

01:06:57.429 --> 01:07:00.831
Oh, oh, do you get bars in here?

01:07:00.833 --> 01:07:01.965
No.

01:07:01.967 --> 01:07:04.501
Ask yourself deeper questions.

01:07:04.503 --> 01:07:08.304
Oh, you mean like
meaningful questions.

01:07:08.306 --> 01:07:10.072
Yes, exactly.

01:07:10.074 --> 01:07:11.307
Ask, my child.

01:07:17.048 --> 01:07:18.447
How is Jessica getting
all her followers?

01:07:18.449 --> 01:07:20.352
She's buying her
likes, isn't she?

01:07:21.186 --> 01:07:22.188
Oh my god.

01:07:23.054 --> 01:07:23.889
Is she real?

01:07:29.327 --> 01:07:30.396
Let me tell you a secret.

01:07:31.597 --> 01:07:34.130
The ultimate answer
you're looking for,

01:07:34.132 --> 01:07:35.865
it will end your search

01:07:35.867 --> 01:07:38.534
and will take you to a new
level of consciousness.

01:07:38.536 --> 01:07:41.470
Space time will come
together, and your

01:07:41.472 --> 01:07:43.373
- questions will be answered.
- Huh?

01:07:43.375 --> 01:07:46.409
For example, when the
ancient gods came down

01:07:46.411 --> 01:07:47.943
in their flying chariots

01:07:47.945 --> 01:07:50.315
and seeded mankind
with their DNA,

01:07:51.215 --> 01:07:53.215
the aliens never left.

01:07:53.217 --> 01:07:54.217
They're still here.

01:07:54.219 --> 01:07:57.253
Touchy-feely Chuck, Bob,
and Steve tried to help,

01:07:57.255 --> 01:07:59.322
but accidentally
caused the disco era

01:07:59.324 --> 01:08:01.057
and the porn industry.

01:08:01.059 --> 01:08:02.492
Then there are
the lizard people.

01:08:02.494 --> 01:08:04.193
Total assholes!

01:08:04.195 --> 01:08:07.264
Homeland Security was founded
to keep them in check.

01:08:07.266 --> 01:08:08.597
They created the internet

01:08:08.599 --> 01:08:11.367
to distract the people from
what's really going on.

01:08:11.369 --> 01:08:12.668
And that is the secret wisdom

01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:15.906
that only a few chosen
have ever been given.

01:08:15.908 --> 01:08:19.509
The knowledge will alter the
very fabric of the universe

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.415
and free your mind
of enslavement.

01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:27.118
Yeah, I'm gonna go now.

01:08:29.386 --> 01:08:31.220
What a weirdo.

01:08:31.221 --> 01:08:32.256
What, really?

01:08:34.493 --> 01:08:37.430
Looks like I picked the wrong
day to stop sniffing glue.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.442
Oh my
god, what is wrong with me?

01:08:53.444 --> 01:08:55.544
Why am I such a perv?

01:08:55.546 --> 01:08:58.348
That guy had super
important junk to say.

01:08:58.350 --> 01:08:59.683
Do I need help?

01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:28.648
O.M.G.

01:09:29.613 --> 01:09:32.381
- Barbi?
- Jessica?

01:09:32.384 --> 01:09:34.183
What are you doing here?

01:09:34.185 --> 01:09:36.220
I didn't know you
hiked these trails.

01:09:39.457 --> 01:09:40.992
Are you totally copying me?

01:09:41.993 --> 01:09:43.528
Wait a minute, what trails?

01:09:44.662 --> 01:09:47.399
The trail that's
like 10 feet that way.

01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:54.306
What?

01:09:56.408 --> 01:09:58.040
I come here every day.

01:09:58.042 --> 01:10:00.545
How do you think I get
those inspirational selfies?

01:10:01.512 --> 01:10:02.711
You get those here?

01:10:02.713 --> 01:10:05.147
Yeah.

01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.984
Bag of dicks.

01:10:11.323 --> 01:10:12.258
Wow.

01:10:14.259 --> 01:10:15.394
You're wearing that?

01:10:17.429 --> 01:10:18.596
Brave choice.

01:10:21.332 --> 01:10:23.366
So, where have you been?

01:10:23.368 --> 01:10:25.501
You haven't like uploaded
in like two days.

01:10:25.503 --> 01:10:26.972
People think you're dead.

01:10:27.706 --> 01:10:29.406
Yeah.

01:10:29.408 --> 01:10:32.142
There's like Where's Barbi
memes all over the web.

01:10:32.144 --> 01:10:33.045
Really?

01:10:34.311 --> 01:10:35.280
I was here.

01:10:36.414 --> 01:10:37.246
Here?

01:10:37.248 --> 01:10:39.214
Like here?

01:10:39.216 --> 01:10:40.416
For two days?

01:10:40.418 --> 01:10:42.585
Yeah, I was totally lost.

01:10:42.587 --> 01:10:44.420
No way!

01:10:44.422 --> 01:10:46.356
Shut up, shut up!

01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:49.729
You were here,
lost for two days?

01:10:51.395 --> 01:10:52.630
What about the internets?

01:10:54.565 --> 01:10:56.566
Well, I had no signal,

01:10:56.568 --> 01:10:58.537
and then naturally,
my cellphone died.

01:11:02.274 --> 01:11:03.609
You poor thing.

01:11:05.143 --> 01:11:06.476
But thanks.

01:11:06.478 --> 01:11:07.509
Now that you're gone,

01:11:07.511 --> 01:11:08.710
everyone has dropped your feed,

01:11:08.712 --> 01:11:12.182
and I'm the number
one new selfie queen.

01:11:12.184 --> 01:11:13.319
You snooze you lose.

01:11:15.087 --> 01:11:16.585
Bitch!

01:11:16.587 --> 01:11:19.455
I totally knew that you
were stealing my followers

01:11:19.457 --> 01:11:21.092
and paying for subscribers.

01:11:21.792 --> 01:11:22.627
Whatever.

01:11:24.296 --> 01:11:26.798
I just have so many companies
wanting to do collabs with me.

01:11:28.466 --> 01:11:31.201
I'm making so much money.

01:11:31.203 --> 01:11:34.240
Good luck
making a comeback.

01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:36.606
At least my
followers were real.

01:11:36.608 --> 01:11:39.811
Aw, you're just a sore loser.

01:11:41.613 --> 01:11:42.648
And by the way,

01:11:44.381 --> 01:11:46.652
you look like you haven't
been doing your squats.

01:11:47.786 --> 01:11:49.320
Your ass is looking flat.

01:11:57.362 --> 01:11:58.831
Jesus, Barbi.

01:12:00.231 --> 01:12:02.268
You get lost in the
woods for two days

01:12:03.335 --> 01:12:05.703
and you just let everything go.

01:12:06.604 --> 01:12:08.170
Ugh!

01:12:10.341 --> 01:12:11.174
Burn!

01:12:14.813 --> 01:12:15.713
It burns!

01:12:17.649 --> 01:12:18.684
Burn.

01:12:19.684 --> 01:12:20.552
Yeah, burn.

01:12:21.552 --> 01:12:22.587
Tss!

01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:25.722
Too bad you didn't have
that burn to keep you warm

01:12:25.724 --> 01:12:27.760
when you slept here for
the past two nights.

01:12:28.659 --> 01:12:31.593
Throwing some bad shade, girl.

01:12:31.595 --> 01:12:33.164
Here's more.

01:12:35.233 --> 01:12:36.769
Are you wearing
your waist trainer?

01:12:39.738 --> 01:12:41.207
Mm, no.

01:12:42.173 --> 01:12:43.341
You should be.

01:12:44.408 --> 01:12:46.675
You're looking a little soft.

01:12:46.677 --> 01:12:48.678
Have you been
skipping ab day too?

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:50.580
- I was...
- Oh well.

01:12:50.582 --> 01:12:51.650
Good luck.

01:12:52.817 --> 01:12:55.652
I still can't believe you got
lost out here for two days.

01:12:55.654 --> 01:13:00.593
There are like trails
everywhere.

01:13:01.659 --> 01:13:03.259
You're such a basic, Barbi.

01:13:03.261 --> 01:13:05.727
Laters!

01:13:05.729 --> 01:13:07.696
Oh my god, guys, guess what?

01:13:07.698 --> 01:13:09.831
I totally just ran into
this homeless girl.

01:13:09.833 --> 01:13:11.302
Look at her, right there.

01:13:13.904 --> 01:13:16.539
She tried to mug me!

01:13:16.541 --> 01:13:17.842
Like what the eff?

01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:20.509
Hash tag real life.

01:13:20.511 --> 01:13:21.744
I'm not kidding, people.

01:13:21.746 --> 01:13:25.447
Like this happened,
right here, right now.

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.157
What the heck?

01:13:32.623 --> 01:13:35.491
I don't even have like a,
a knife on me or anything,

01:13:35.493 --> 01:13:36.625
I don't.

01:13:36.627 --> 01:13:38.794
Oh my god, she's
looking frantic.

01:13:38.796 --> 01:13:40.495
I mean, look at her,
she's in a pink jacket.

01:13:40.497 --> 01:13:42.264
Like, I don't even know
what she's doing out here.

01:13:42.266 --> 01:13:44.400
- Bag of dicks!
- She tried to steal from me.

01:13:44.402 --> 01:13:45.701
Like, what?

01:13:45.703 --> 01:13:46.803
Wait.

01:13:46.805 --> 01:13:47.836
Where's that trail?

01:13:47.838 --> 01:13:49.272
It was right there.

01:13:49.274 --> 01:13:50.505
She pointed to it
and everything.

01:13:50.507 --> 01:13:51.641
Where did it go?

01:13:51.643 --> 01:13:52.709
I'm gonna die
out here, I swear.

01:13:52.711 --> 01:13:54.910
I'm totally gonna die out here.

01:13:54.912 --> 01:13:56.748
How is this possible?

01:13:57.948 --> 01:13:59.382
What?

01:13:59.384 --> 01:14:01.651
Well, that's it,

01:14:01.653 --> 01:14:03.652
I'm officially a has-been.

01:14:03.654 --> 01:14:04.687
Dead to the world.

01:14:04.689 --> 01:14:05.854
She's won.

01:14:05.856 --> 01:14:07.589
I'm done, it's over.

01:14:07.591 --> 01:14:10.695
Jessica has finally got what
she wanted and replaced me.

01:14:11.863 --> 01:14:13.696
I might as well go
back to the cave

01:14:13.698 --> 01:14:17.567
and party with Red Riding
Hood and hair tutorial girl.

01:14:17.569 --> 01:14:18.867
I'll marry butter knife guy

01:14:18.869 --> 01:14:22.405
and we'll have little
cave-dwelling monks together.

01:14:22.407 --> 01:14:25.775
Maybe we'll get a reality show!

01:14:25.777 --> 01:14:26.845
The Brennans!

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.848
Hey, is that Kenny?

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:33.683
He's still alive?

01:14:33.685 --> 01:14:36.422
Does that mean I'm
not a black widow?

01:14:38.622 --> 01:14:40.458
Oh hey, you again.

01:14:41.493 --> 01:14:42.991
Are you okay?

01:14:42.993 --> 01:14:43.826
It's dangerous.

01:14:43.828 --> 01:14:45.861
You need to leave, now!

01:14:45.863 --> 01:14:46.896
Obviously.

01:14:46.898 --> 01:14:48.897
What the hell is going on?

01:14:48.899 --> 01:14:51.769
Every time I see you
it's some new shit.

01:14:52.936 --> 01:14:54.771
That looks disgusting.

01:14:54.773 --> 01:14:56.571
What happened to your leg!

01:14:56.573 --> 01:14:57.973
It's classified.

01:14:57.975 --> 01:15:00.878
I could tell you, but
I'd have to kill you.

01:15:01.945 --> 01:15:04.550
Which at this point
might not be a bad idea.

01:15:05.684 --> 01:15:07.853
Ugh, doesn't matter,
I'm already dead.

01:15:12.756 --> 01:15:13.390
Fine.

01:15:16.728 --> 01:15:18.396
I work for a government agency

01:15:19.564 --> 01:15:21.664
that deals with
extraterrestrial allies.

01:15:21.666 --> 01:15:24.767
Oh, you mean those three
little gray guys in the forest?

01:15:24.769 --> 01:15:26.905
I thought I was
totally tripping balls.

01:15:27.805 --> 01:15:29.607
You met Chuck, Bob, and Steve?

01:15:30.608 --> 01:15:31.877
I think so, maybe.

01:15:33.811 --> 01:15:35.314
Does it hurt when you sit?

01:15:38.382 --> 01:15:39.749
A little.

01:15:39.751 --> 01:15:41.451
Yeah.

01:15:41.453 --> 01:15:43.820
I think back on their planet
that means you're married.

01:15:43.822 --> 01:15:44.821
Oh, ew!

01:15:44.823 --> 01:15:45.858
No way!

01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:47.924
Ugh!

01:15:47.926 --> 01:15:48.892
Wait, hold on a second,

01:15:48.894 --> 01:15:50.996
if they're friendly, why
are you fighting them?

01:15:51.930 --> 01:15:54.066
No, I'm not fighting them.

01:15:55.367 --> 01:15:56.632
Chuck, Bob, and
Steve are great guys.

01:15:56.634 --> 01:15:59.471
A little touchy-feely,
but still great guys.

01:16:00.805 --> 01:16:02.138
I'm fighting the other guys.

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:03.638
What other guys?

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.974
The eat your face
off acid for blood

01:16:05.976 --> 01:16:08.510
world domination ones.

01:16:08.512 --> 01:16:11.147
Look, there's a lot
of shit going on here,

01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:13.549
but I don't have time to
tell you all that right now.

01:16:13.551 --> 01:16:14.453
Uh, yeah.

01:17:41.872 --> 01:17:43.205
Wait!

01:17:43.207 --> 01:17:45.674
What am I doing?

01:17:45.676 --> 01:17:47.843
I can't just leave him again!

01:17:47.845 --> 01:17:49.845
He's saved my ass like
three times already!

01:17:49.847 --> 01:17:52.514
This might be the
perfect opportunity

01:17:52.516 --> 01:17:55.250
for me to actually
do something good!

01:17:55.252 --> 01:17:57.986
It's not like I have
anything else to live for.

01:17:57.988 --> 01:18:01.523
I have to change my goals
from taking the best selfies

01:18:01.525 --> 01:18:05.061
to making the world
a better place!

01:18:05.063 --> 01:18:06.295
From this day forth,

01:18:06.297 --> 01:18:10.165
I'll never again take a box of
doughnuts to Weight Watchers!

01:18:10.167 --> 01:18:14.603
I'll never watch another house
full of kittens burn down!

01:18:14.605 --> 01:18:18.540
I will never again sell
Ziploc bags full of corn syrup

01:18:18.542 --> 01:18:21.544
as breast implants to cancer
survivors on the Dark Web.

01:18:21.546 --> 01:18:25.080
I will never again donate
my parents' used sex toys

01:18:25.082 --> 01:18:26.049
to children's charity.

01:18:26.051 --> 01:18:29.919
I will never again sell
orphans into slavery!

01:18:29.921 --> 01:18:34.690
I will never again set the
homeless on fire just for lulz!

01:18:34.692 --> 01:18:37.159
I will not sit by and
watch another old lady

01:18:37.161 --> 01:18:39.896
get dragged off by coyotes.

01:18:39.898 --> 01:18:40.763
Never again!

01:18:40.765 --> 01:18:44.733
And I will never,
ever eat anything

01:18:44.735 --> 01:18:47.738
that doesn't say gluten-free!

01:18:49.106 --> 01:18:51.042
If only I had my eyes open.

01:18:52.877 --> 01:18:55.311
Not always staring at my phone!

01:18:55.313 --> 01:18:57.048
Paid more attention!

01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:00.519
What am I missing?

01:20:16.027 --> 01:20:17.927
There is so much
more to this world

01:20:17.929 --> 01:20:20.196
than what I see on
that tiny screen.

01:20:20.198 --> 01:20:24.333
I'm gonna make amends for
all the things I did wrong.

01:20:24.335 --> 01:20:29.271
Somehow, I will take
responsibility for my actions.

01:20:29.273 --> 01:20:33.275
I will make the
world a better place.

01:20:33.277 --> 01:20:35.745
It's time for me

01:20:35.747 --> 01:20:40.185
to finally grab that bag
of dicks by the balls.

01:20:42.386 --> 01:20:46.257
And I start now!

01:22:39.970 --> 01:22:41.004
Are you okay?

01:22:41.006 --> 01:22:43.472
My leg's pointed in
three different directions.

01:22:43.474 --> 01:22:46.875
I wish that beam put me together
a little bit straighter.

01:22:48.445 --> 01:22:49.277
Ow!

01:22:49.279 --> 01:22:51.280
Oh, easy kid.

01:22:51.282 --> 01:22:52.848
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:54.383
I'm from Texas.

01:22:54.385 --> 01:22:55.851
My dad was a Marine,

01:22:55.853 --> 01:22:58.155
and my granny has a
bigger gun than yours.

01:23:01.125 --> 01:23:02.060
This is gonna hurt.

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.261
Are you sure you
know what you're doing?

01:23:05.195 --> 01:23:06.030
Um, nah.

01:23:11.301 --> 01:23:12.336
Thanks.

01:23:13.371 --> 01:23:14.206
Looks ratchet.

01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:21.242
What the hell are you doing?

01:23:21.244 --> 01:23:22.480
Taking off a waist trainer.

01:23:23.914 --> 01:23:24.546
What the hell are
you gonna do with that?

01:23:24.548 --> 01:23:26.048
Won't fit my waist.

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:30.518
It's steel-boned.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.323
Oh you've gotta be kidding me.

01:23:35.193 --> 01:23:36.261
I am not kidding you.

01:23:38.061 --> 01:23:39.331
Pink is not my color.

01:23:40.297 --> 01:23:41.899
It's gonna have
to work for now.

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:45.067
There was a girl in
a suit in the forest

01:23:45.069 --> 01:23:46.235
stuck under a rock.

01:23:46.237 --> 01:23:48.236
Do you know what
happened to her?

01:23:48.238 --> 01:23:50.839
Um, yeah, it's kinda messy.

01:23:50.841 --> 01:23:54.343
Um, rogue double agent,
Homeland Security,

01:23:54.345 --> 01:23:56.081
stole something very valuable.

01:23:57.247 --> 01:23:59.283
You haven't seen a briefcase
around here, have you?

01:24:08.024 --> 01:24:09.558
You mean this?

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:14.330
Um, yeah, that's, uh,

01:24:14.332 --> 01:24:15.801
that's definitely it.

01:24:19.036 --> 01:24:19.968
Thanks.

01:24:19.970 --> 01:24:22.406
Um, this looks pretty good.

01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:24.973
Can you move?

01:24:24.975 --> 01:24:26.407
Yeah, I can move.

01:24:26.409 --> 01:24:28.212
I can't dance, but I can move.

01:24:33.951 --> 01:24:37.052
You know, you're
pretty good at this.

01:24:37.054 --> 01:24:39.356
You ever considered a
career in government work?

01:24:40.358 --> 01:24:41.589
Could use someone
with your skills,

01:24:41.591 --> 01:24:43.959
but you'd have to leave
your old life behind.

01:24:43.961 --> 01:24:47.129
Well, I've been
offline for two days,

01:24:47.131 --> 01:24:49.330
so everybody already
thinks I'm dead.

01:24:49.332 --> 01:24:53.103
We can give you
a cool code name like, uh,

01:24:54.137 --> 01:24:54.972
Ronan.

01:24:56.239 --> 01:24:58.607
Oh, samurai with no master.

01:24:58.609 --> 01:24:59.444
I like it.

01:25:00.543 --> 01:25:02.010
Oh that's actually
just the name

01:25:02.012 --> 01:25:03.012
of my favorite sushi
joint down in Soho,

01:25:03.014 --> 01:25:05.013
but I like what you said too.

01:25:05.015 --> 01:25:07.282
Hey, Chuck, Bob, and Steve,

01:25:07.284 --> 01:25:10.119
why aren't they helping
you fight the bad guys?

01:25:10.121 --> 01:25:12.454
No, those guys
are lovers, not fighters,

01:25:12.456 --> 01:25:14.423
but they make great tech.

01:25:14.425 --> 01:25:15.327
Here, hold this.

01:25:22.166 --> 01:25:25.200
Yeah, need immediate extraction.

01:25:25.202 --> 01:25:27.102
You talk to your MP3 player?

01:25:39.149 --> 01:25:42.152
You know, you're,
you're kinda cute.

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.956
Welcome to your new life.

01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:47.524
Take us up.

01:26:28.298 --> 01:26:30.034
Hey, hey,
there's my car!

01:26:32.235 --> 01:26:33.701
No no no, you guys can
just drop me off here.

01:26:38.208 --> 01:26:40.041
Thanks!

01:26:40.043 --> 01:26:43.144
Wow,
not bad for a long weekend.

01:26:43.146 --> 01:26:45.680
Three husbands, and
Kenny's kinda cute.

01:26:45.682 --> 01:26:48.717
I'm sure Chuck, Bob, and Steve
are gonna be totally chill

01:26:48.719 --> 01:26:50.518
with me seeing other people.

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.487
If it's outside
the solar system,

01:26:52.489 --> 01:26:55.223
it probably doesn't
count, right?

01:26:55.225 --> 01:26:57.425
So much for being a spinster.

01:26:57.427 --> 01:27:00.465
I can't wait to go home
and take a nice shower.

01:27:01.465 --> 01:27:02.363
Oh, wait.

01:27:02.365 --> 01:27:04.532
I need my keys, duh.

01:27:04.534 --> 01:27:06.101
Where did I put those?

01:27:06.103 --> 01:27:08.169
Gotta be in here somewhere.

01:27:08.171 --> 01:27:09.440
I left them right here.

01:27:11.574 --> 01:27:12.543
I left them right here.

01:27:14.412 --> 01:27:15.544
Oh no.

01:27:15.546 --> 01:27:17.382
Where did I leave them last?

01:27:23.554 --> 01:27:27.188
Hey, can I, can I
put my keys on you?

01:27:27.190 --> 01:27:28.589
Yeah, sure.

01:27:36.634 --> 01:27:40.535
OMG, that's right.

01:27:40.537 --> 01:27:41.505
Bag of dick!

01:27:46.377 --> 01:27:48.544
You're
right, after all that.

01:27:48.546 --> 01:27:50.611
I had a spaceship,

01:27:50.613 --> 01:27:52.815
and now I have to take the bus.

01:27:52.817 --> 01:27:54.616
Worst

01:27:54.618 --> 01:27:55.420
weekend

01:27:56.487 --> 01:27:57.322
ever.

01:29:11.427 --> 01:29:12.262
Whoa!

01:29:13.697 --> 01:29:16.665
As if I haven't had
enough, I lose my keys too.

01:29:16.667 --> 01:29:19.168
What kind of freaking
world is this?

01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:22.340
Haven't I had enough
of this world?

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.507
This is terrible.

01:29:25.509 --> 01:29:26.743
What am I gonna do now?

01:29:35.586 --> 01:29:36.652
Oh my god, grandma.

01:29:36.654 --> 01:29:37.718
What are you doing here?

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.588
Get in the car.

01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:40.589
Oh my god!

01:29:40.591 --> 01:29:42.590
Thank you so much!

01:29:42.592 --> 01:29:44.593
You have no idea what
I've just been through

01:29:44.595 --> 01:29:46.394
for the last two days!

01:29:46.396 --> 01:29:48.397
Well not
anymore, you're okay now.

01:29:48.399 --> 01:29:50.432
Yes, thank you!

01:29:50.434 --> 01:29:51.269
Yay!

01:29:51.514 --> 01:29:56.514
