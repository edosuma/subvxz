01:28.260 --> 01:29.790
Hey, kiddo.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.970
- What?
- I found something.

01:31.970 --> 01:34.200
You gotta check this out.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.300
"Jumanji."

01:39.370 --> 01:40.510
Board game?

01:40.510 --> 01:43.040
Who plays board games?

03:17.020 --> 03:18.920
Parry. Parry.

03:18.930 --> 03:21.130
Evade. Blam.

03:21.130 --> 03:22.860
Uppercut.

03:22.860 --> 03:24.090
Head slam. You're dead.

03:24.090 --> 03:26.900
Strike. Strike.
Counterstrike. Head slam.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.230
Ka-pow.

03:28.240 --> 03:31.360
<i>Get ready. Fight.</i>

03:31.370 --> 03:34.040
I got it.

03:43.550 --> 03:45.120
"...Benjamin Franklin,

03:45.120 --> 03:47.610
"and it was this sense
of national exceptionalism

03:47.620 --> 03:51.460
that fueled the spreading
wildfire of westward expansion."

03:51.460 --> 03:52.980
Spencer? Honey?

03:52.990 --> 03:56.420
Aah! Mom, what did we say
about the knocking?

03:56.420 --> 03:59.360
I'm late for work. You going
to your father's after school?

03:59.360 --> 04:01.360
- Yeah, probably.
- Don't forget your EpiPen.

04:01.370 --> 04:03.490
Please, remember,
the world is terrifying.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.960
Be careful of everything.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.330
I love you
more than life itself. Bye.

04:06.340 --> 04:07.640
- See you Sunday night.
- Okay.

04:14.110 --> 04:16.940
- Later, Mama.
- Eat something.

04:16.950 --> 04:18.339
I can't.
I gotta go meet Spencer.

04:18.339 --> 04:21.110
- Spencer Gilpin?
- Yeah, Spencer Gilpin.

04:21.110 --> 04:22.520
He's, uh...
He's been tutoring me.

04:22.520 --> 04:25.180
- He's helping get my grades up.
- I love to hear that.

04:25.180 --> 04:27.420
- Little Spencer Gilpin.
- Yeah.

04:27.420 --> 04:30.260
- Your grades gonna be okay?
- That's why I'm getting help.

04:30.260 --> 04:32.650
I'd hate for you
to get dropped from the team...

04:32.660 --> 04:34.920
I'm not gonna get dropped
from the team.

04:36.230 --> 04:39.030
It's... It's gonna
be fine. Okay?

04:47.410 --> 04:48.970
Mm.

04:58.140 --> 05:00.010
Okay.

05:00.010 --> 05:03.210
That's cute, right?

05:03.220 --> 05:05.050
Yeah.

05:26.580 --> 05:28.910
- Yo.
- Hey, Fridge.

05:30.110 --> 05:32.010
Why you wearing a raincoat?

05:32.010 --> 05:34.310
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it's not raining.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.070
Oh, well, it might.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.250
I mean, you never know
what's gonna happen.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.150
- Oy vey.
- What the hell, man?

05:42.160 --> 05:43.750
Do you mind?
Can we speed this up?

05:43.750 --> 05:46.320
Freak House makes me
very uncomfortable.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.300
Here you go.

05:49.460 --> 05:52.020
- You proofread everything?
- Yeah, I proofed it.

05:52.030 --> 05:55.130
And I gave it a beginning...

05:55.130 --> 05:57.470
and an ending
and s-some in the middle.

05:57.470 --> 06:00.330
I would've done it myself,
if I had the time or whatever,

06:00.330 --> 06:02.470
- but...
- Yeah, it's no big deal.

06:02.470 --> 06:05.500
Hey, man, I was thinking, so...
I mean, it's been really fun,

06:05.510 --> 06:08.040
doing your papers
and your homework and stuff,

06:08.040 --> 06:10.280
but I don't know
what you're doing this weekend.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.170
- I was thinking maybe we could...
- This weekend. Yeah, ah...

06:13.180 --> 06:16.150
- Hey, Fridge.
- Hey.

06:16.150 --> 06:18.450
You need a ride?

06:18.450 --> 06:20.550
- I'm going with her.
- You know what?

06:20.560 --> 06:24.550
That's actually better for me,
scheduling-wise, too, so...

06:24.560 --> 06:26.360
See you later, Refrigerator.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.420
Sorry. Sorry.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.490
What up, girl?

06:33.030 --> 06:35.100
Whatever.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.030
It's not like
I was your best friend

06:37.040 --> 06:38.230
for your entire childhood.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.800
- That's fine.
- What'd you say?

06:43.580 --> 06:45.250
Uh, nothing, sir.

06:46.670 --> 06:48.680
Oh, that guy is super weird.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.480
That poor man.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.210
So awful what happened
to those people.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.080
I was talking about the kid.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.350
What are you doing out here?

06:57.350 --> 06:59.230
I was just talking
to my friend.

07:00.490 --> 07:01.680
You should be more careful

07:01.690 --> 07:03.190
where you loiter,
you hear me?

07:03.190 --> 07:05.190
Yes, Mr. Vreeke. I hear you.

07:05.190 --> 07:08.130
This world swallows up
kids like you.

07:25.710 --> 07:28.280
It's been over two
hours since I've posted,

07:28.280 --> 07:30.420
and he hasn't commented.
He hasn't even liked it.

07:30.420 --> 07:32.580
- You saw it.
- <i>Yeah, gorge.</i>

07:32.580 --> 07:34.410
<i>I don't know
what his problem is.</i>

07:34.420 --> 07:36.550
Thank you. It's not like
I post all the time,

07:36.560 --> 07:38.160
just enough
to stay relevant.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.590
But it's cute enough
for Noah to...

07:39.600 --> 07:41.620
<i>Hey, there's
some rando behind you.</i>

07:43.090 --> 07:45.360
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:45.360 --> 07:48.290
Bethany, did you just make
a call during a quiz?

07:48.290 --> 07:49.830
Yeah. But I finished
my quiz already.

07:49.830 --> 07:54.110
Oh, okay. Well, have you noticed
that other people haven't?

07:55.210 --> 07:58.270
- So?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Let me back up.

07:58.270 --> 08:01.610
You're aware there are other
people in the world, right?

08:02.780 --> 08:04.840
Look, um, you know,

08:04.840 --> 08:07.410
I'm dealing with something
right now,

08:07.410 --> 08:09.420
and I'm no happier
about it than you are.

08:09.420 --> 08:12.180
I'm having a crisis,
and Lucinda, I mean,

08:12.180 --> 08:13.850
she's supporting me
as a woman,

08:13.850 --> 08:16.190
and it feels like
maybe you should too.

08:17.460 --> 08:19.720
- Just hang up the phone.
- Okay, I'll wrap it up.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.730
- Bethany, hang it up now.
- Two minutes and we're done.

08:22.730 --> 08:24.600
And that's detention.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.530
All right, keep
those arms pumping.

08:29.560 --> 08:30.130
Let's go!

08:30.140 --> 08:31.500
Bethany, you're late.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.640
Sorry.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.470
I heard she broke up
with that football guy.

08:37.470 --> 08:40.440
This could be
your opening, Fussfeld.

08:40.450 --> 08:42.610
We're gonna practice

08:42.610 --> 08:43.880
catching and throwing.

08:43.880 --> 08:47.390
So partner up and grab
a football. Let's move!

08:49.720 --> 08:50.880
Hey, Martha.

08:50.890 --> 08:54.460
Martha. You can't
play catch by yourself.

08:54.460 --> 08:56.160
Pair up.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.720
Come on. Let's go.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.590
No. No, I'm good.

09:00.490 --> 09:01.660
Okay.

09:04.440 --> 09:08.330
You have to participate
just like everybody else.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.640
Otherwise,
why are you even here?

09:10.640 --> 09:11.870
It's a requirement.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.500
- Martha...
- I think it's pointless.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.570
Gym class is not gonna get me
into Princeton,

09:15.570 --> 09:17.710
and I don't understand
the obsession with throwing

09:17.710 --> 09:20.340
a ball into a hoop
and, "Touchdown, five points!"

09:20.350 --> 09:23.450
Okay. There's a lot wrong
with that, but first of all...

09:23.450 --> 09:25.620
It's physical activity,
which is good for you.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.810
With other people,
also good for you.

09:27.820 --> 09:31.450
And if you try it,
you might even have some fun.

09:31.450 --> 09:33.920
Fun. That's what
we're doing here? Fun?

09:33.930 --> 09:35.620
This is school.

09:35.630 --> 09:38.260
We are supposed to be
learning things that matter.

09:38.260 --> 09:39.560
- Okay, Martha...
- We don't have

09:39.560 --> 09:41.660
a lot of time in this life,
and I personally

09:41.670 --> 09:45.160
don't wanna waste it on being,
like, a gym teacher.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.370
- That... That came out wrong.
- Yeah, it sure did.

09:50.380 --> 09:52.200
That's detention.

09:53.270 --> 09:55.940
That was hard-core.

09:55.950 --> 09:57.850
Badass.

09:57.850 --> 10:00.640
Spencer Gilpin?

10:03.890 --> 10:05.360
Have a seat, Spencer.

10:15.820 --> 10:17.420
Miss Mathers?

10:17.430 --> 10:19.930
"And it was this sense
of national exceptionalism

10:19.930 --> 10:23.960
that fueled the spreading
wildfire of westward expansion."

10:23.970 --> 10:26.710
Does that sound familiar,
Mr. Gilpin?

10:28.570 --> 10:31.240
- It does not.
- It's the last sentence

10:31.240 --> 10:33.440
of Anthony's paper
on westward expansion.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.910
And, coincidentally,
it's the last sentence

10:35.910 --> 10:39.280
of your paper on westward
expansion from last year.

10:41.980 --> 10:43.850
That's interesting.

10:43.850 --> 10:45.620
Is it?

10:45.630 --> 10:48.890
I think so. I mean,
what are the odds of that?

10:48.890 --> 10:50.520
Slim.

10:50.530 --> 10:53.460
Yeah, you also
used the same metaphor:

10:53.470 --> 10:55.590
"the spreading wildfire,"
in your papers

10:55.590 --> 10:59.330
on the Boston Tea Party,
the Battle of Gettysburg,

10:59.330 --> 11:01.640
and the women's suffrage
movement.

11:04.270 --> 11:06.700
It's so hot in this room.

11:06.710 --> 11:10.470
Anthony, I know how much
you need to pass my class,

11:10.470 --> 11:11.870
but this is not
how you do it.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.610
- I will not tolerate cheating.
- Cheating?

11:14.620 --> 11:16.780
I didn't... I didn't...
I didn't cheat.

11:16.790 --> 11:18.210
It was my fault.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.350
I made him do it.

11:21.350 --> 11:26.560
You made him...
have you write his paper?

11:27.760 --> 11:29.490
Yeah.

11:29.490 --> 11:31.030
Mm-hm.

11:33.430 --> 11:36.500
Look.
I'm sorry, okay?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.640
No, no,
it's not okay.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.360
What the hell, man?
You got me kicked off the team.

11:41.370 --> 11:43.470
Yeah, well, you could've
gotten me expelled.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.370
It's not like you're the only
one who's living dangerously.

11:46.380 --> 11:47.840
- Living dangerously?
- Yes.

11:47.850 --> 11:51.580
This is the most dangerous thing
I've ever done in my life.

11:51.580 --> 11:54.680
And now look at me.
I'm paying the price.

11:56.060 --> 11:57.380
Well...

11:57.390 --> 11:59.450
isn't this a fun group?

11:59.450 --> 12:02.390
Welcome to detention.

12:02.960 --> 12:03.990
Yes, Spencer?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.620
I wanna say that I'm sorry.

12:05.620 --> 12:07.990
- Thank you.
- Bentley, all I did was make...

12:07.990 --> 12:10.530
Bethany, please.
You're all here for a reason.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.830
You know what it is.

12:11.840 --> 12:14.060
But this is what
you should be thinking about:

12:14.060 --> 12:17.100
Who you are...

12:17.100 --> 12:18.870
in this moment in time,

12:18.870 --> 12:21.800
and who you want to be.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.110
You get one life.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.480
You decide
how you're gonna spend it.

12:28.340 --> 12:29.980
Fortunately...

12:29.980 --> 12:33.020
there is no better place
for self-reflection

12:33.020 --> 12:34.490
than detention.

12:34.490 --> 12:37.320
Get up, everybody. Let's go.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.990
We are turning this
into a new computer center.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.630
But before we do,
it has to be cleaned out.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.440
These old magazines are bound
for the recycling plant.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.030
But they have to be prepped
before they go.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.880
It seems all the staples
must be removed.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.770
Whatever you don't finish today,
you finish tomorrow.

13:06.770 --> 13:08.910
- Tomorrow's Saturday.
- Because I wouldn't play?

13:08.910 --> 13:10.880
- I don't think that'll work.
- That's fair.

13:10.880 --> 13:14.980
- Shut up.
- So I suggest you get started.

13:14.980 --> 13:17.520
Choose your weapons.

13:22.860 --> 13:25.760
Hey, what the hell
they need with a bowling ball?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.870
Seriously, no reception?

13:28.870 --> 13:32.500
- Okay, can today get any worse?
- Are you gonna help?

13:32.500 --> 13:33.970
Or are you too pretty?

13:33.970 --> 13:35.870
I'm too pretty.

13:40.780 --> 13:43.710
Hey. I was watching you
with Coach Web today.

13:43.710 --> 13:45.580
I wasn't watching you,
I wasn't...

13:45.590 --> 13:47.180
Not, like, in a weird way.
I just...

13:47.180 --> 13:49.110
I was in the room.
We're in the same class.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.190
Um, but I thought you were
saying some really smart things

13:52.190 --> 13:55.490
about why P.E. sucks
and, um...

13:55.490 --> 13:57.660
about other subjects.

13:57.660 --> 13:59.800
Thanks.

14:00.830 --> 14:02.430
Yeah.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.830
Yo. What's this?

14:10.500 --> 14:12.500
- I don't know.
- What is it, like,

14:12.500 --> 14:14.840
some type of old-school
Nintendo or something?

14:14.840 --> 14:16.570
I don't think so.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.640
I don't recognize it.

14:36.190 --> 14:39.000
"A game for those
who seek to find...

14:39.000 --> 14:41.860
"a way to leave
their world behind.

14:43.930 --> 14:46.000
Jumanji."

14:46.000 --> 14:47.600
Staples, people. Staples.

14:47.610 --> 14:48.930
"Jumanji"?
What does that mean?

14:48.940 --> 14:50.970
I have no idea.
Never heard of it.

14:53.940 --> 14:55.540
Hm...

14:55.550 --> 14:57.040
Uh, which one do I pick?

14:57.040 --> 14:59.680
I don't know. I don't
think it matters that much.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.480
"Jefferson 'Seaplane' McDonough.

15:02.490 --> 15:04.750
Pilot and rascal."

15:04.750 --> 15:07.720
- It's not working.
- Okay, try another one.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.480
"Franklin 'Moose' Finbar."

15:10.490 --> 15:11.950
Hm.

15:11.950 --> 15:13.220
He sounds like a badass.

15:13.220 --> 15:16.660
And he's a zoology expert,
which is awesome.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.430
- You pick.
- Okay.

15:22.730 --> 15:25.940
"Dr. Smolder Bravestone."

15:28.800 --> 15:30.870
Bethany, you in?

15:30.870 --> 15:32.480
Fine.

15:35.510 --> 15:36.840
I'll be...

15:36.840 --> 15:38.980
Shelly Oberon...

15:38.980 --> 15:40.280
the curvy genius.

15:41.850 --> 15:44.110
Hey, yo, Staples, come on.
It's your turn.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.620
Uh, no.

15:45.620 --> 15:48.120
- No, thanks.
- Wait. Just for a few minutes?

15:48.120 --> 15:50.120
It'll be fun.

15:50.130 --> 15:51.520
She's not big on fun.

15:54.860 --> 15:57.600
Okay. Fine.

16:00.530 --> 16:03.740
This may be the
lamest thing I've ever done.

16:03.740 --> 16:06.530
I highly doubt that.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.870
<i>Welcome to Jumanji!</i>

16:24.620 --> 16:25.690
What's going on?

16:29.060 --> 16:30.620
I think it's shorting out.

16:37.290 --> 16:39.570
Unplug it!

16:43.640 --> 16:45.900
Whoa!

16:47.570 --> 16:49.840
What's going on?
What's happening to your hands?

16:49.840 --> 16:52.120
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

16:55.950 --> 16:56.920
Spencer!

16:58.250 --> 16:59.350
Oh, my God!

16:59.360 --> 17:01.920
Oh-oh-oh...

17:06.060 --> 17:07.329
Aah!

17:08.790 --> 17:10.190
What the hell, man?

17:10.190 --> 17:11.690
Oh, no.

17:11.700 --> 17:15.569
Holy shit...

17:22.310 --> 17:24.200
Whoa!

17:26.339 --> 17:28.810
Aah.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.030
Guys?

17:51.030 --> 17:54.740
Guys? Why do I
sound like this?

18:01.980 --> 18:03.610
Where's my hair?

18:13.880 --> 18:15.990
What the...?

18:15.990 --> 18:17.790
Oh, God!

18:20.260 --> 18:21.690
Ow, unh.

18:35.130 --> 18:36.740
Huh?

18:38.840 --> 18:40.310
Oh...

18:40.310 --> 18:42.910
What kind of stupid-ass...?

18:44.880 --> 18:47.150
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

18:49.350 --> 18:50.780
Who is she?

18:50.780 --> 18:53.920
Who are you guys? Huh?

18:53.920 --> 18:55.890
Okay, what the hell?

18:55.890 --> 18:57.720
God! Oh, my God!

18:57.720 --> 18:59.150
- Get off of me!
- I am suing...

18:59.160 --> 19:01.830
- What's wrong with my voice?
- Get off of me!

19:01.830 --> 19:04.230
- Where am I?
- You're crushing me! Get off!

19:05.430 --> 19:06.930
Get...

19:11.770 --> 19:15.900
What the hell?
What happened to the rest of me?

19:15.910 --> 19:18.440
What is this?
What is this on my back?

19:18.440 --> 19:19.440
What is this?

19:19.450 --> 19:21.910
Oh, my God.

19:21.910 --> 19:22.880
Fridge?

19:24.150 --> 19:26.220
Yeah, I'm Fridge.
Who are you?

19:30.320 --> 19:31.750
I'm Spencer.

19:31.750 --> 19:36.320
What? The hell you are.
What is going on? Huh?

19:36.320 --> 19:38.120
I think...

19:38.120 --> 19:39.320
we're in the game.

19:39.330 --> 19:41.760
- Sorry, excuse me?
- What are you talking about?

19:41.760 --> 19:43.360
Somehow, I don't know how...

19:43.370 --> 19:46.760
I think we got, like,
sucked into the game.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.940
And we've become the avatars
that we chose.

19:48.940 --> 19:52.470
So it's me, Spencer,
but yet I look and sound...

19:52.470 --> 19:56.680
like Dr. Smolder Bravestone.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.050
You're telling me
that you're Spencer?

20:04.050 --> 20:05.950
Yes, yes, yes. That's it.

20:05.950 --> 20:09.820
Fridge, I'm Spencer.
Which means you're Moose Finbar.

20:09.820 --> 20:12.160
It says it right there
on your vest. And...

20:13.360 --> 20:14.890
- Martha?
- Yeah.

20:14.900 --> 20:17.090
You're Ruby Roundhouse.

20:17.090 --> 20:20.900
And, Bethany,
you're Professor Shelly Oberon.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.820
Only Shelly must be
short for Sheldon.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.090
What are you talking about?

20:24.100 --> 20:26.130
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, he's right.

20:26.140 --> 20:28.400
And you...

20:28.410 --> 20:30.470
you're Spencer? You?

20:30.480 --> 20:32.000
Yes. Guys, I'm telling you.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.370
I am Spencer. I'm... Aah!

20:34.380 --> 20:35.880
Yep, that's Spencer.

20:35.880 --> 20:37.410
Whoa. Whoa!

20:37.420 --> 20:39.980
So that means I...

20:39.980 --> 20:41.310
I'm...

20:43.020 --> 20:44.920
Wait, Bethany.
Bethany, don't!

20:44.920 --> 20:47.750
No!

20:50.860 --> 20:53.230
I'm an overweight,
middle-aged man.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.920
Uh, I have a tattoo.

20:55.930 --> 20:58.800
My mom always said she'd
kill me if I ever got a tattoo.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.170
What is this?

21:00.170 --> 21:01.860
I have one too.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.530
Sometimes.

21:05.540 --> 21:07.910
Wait a second.

21:07.910 --> 21:10.370
Where's my phone?

21:12.140 --> 21:13.810
Aah.

21:13.810 --> 21:15.880
Why am I wearing this outfit
in a jungle?

21:15.880 --> 21:18.280
Tiny, little shorts
and a leather halter top.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.850
I mean, what is this?

21:19.850 --> 21:22.220
I look like a living
garden gnome. Where is my phone?

21:22.220 --> 21:24.820
- Who cares?
- We are in different bodies!

21:24.830 --> 21:27.250
It doesn't seem like
the most pressing concern

21:27.250 --> 21:29.190
- at this moment.
- Really? You don't think

21:29.190 --> 21:31.260
this would be a good moment
to make a call

21:31.260 --> 21:33.150
or text somebody
or change your status

21:33.160 --> 21:34.490
to "stuck in
a video game"?

21:34.490 --> 21:37.900
All I'm saying is,
I don't have my Claritin, okay?

21:37.900 --> 21:39.830
And I'm allergic to
almost everything.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.160
Oh, no.

21:41.170 --> 21:43.900
You got allergies,
Spencer? Huh?

21:43.900 --> 21:45.910
I don't have the top two feet
of my body!

21:45.910 --> 21:48.600
You guys, this can't
actually be happening.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.170
Maybe we're all in a coma.

21:51.170 --> 21:54.150
Together?
We're all in a coma together?

21:54.150 --> 21:56.440
It's the only explanation.
That old game machine

21:56.440 --> 21:58.950
must have electrocuted us,
and now we're...

22:00.590 --> 22:03.950
- Oh, my God, Bethany!
- Oh, my God, oh, my God!

22:03.950 --> 22:05.320
Stop it!

22:12.260 --> 22:15.200
Oh, my God! You better get
in there and go save her.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.100
I'm not getting in there!
You get in.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.130
I'm not going anywhere.
I got a backpack on.

22:19.140 --> 22:21.870
You don't get in water with a
backpack. Everybody knows that.

22:30.210 --> 22:31.140
Ow!

22:31.140 --> 22:32.350
What the...?

22:32.350 --> 22:34.950
- Bethany!
- What just...?

22:36.350 --> 22:37.580
Are you okay?

22:37.580 --> 22:39.950
That was so intense.

22:39.950 --> 22:41.920
I, like, can't even
with this place.

22:41.930 --> 22:44.220
- What just happened to you?
- I got eaten by a rhino,

22:44.220 --> 22:46.960
and then I fell, like,
a thousand feet from the sky.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.660
Yeah, that's what
it looked like.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.560
That was a hippo.
They're omnivorous.

22:50.570 --> 22:53.060
They're fast as a horse
over short distances,

22:53.060 --> 22:55.430
and they have the bite force
of 8100 newtons.

22:56.470 --> 22:57.370
How do I know this?

22:57.370 --> 22:58.900
You're an expert in zoology.

22:58.900 --> 23:00.670
- What?
- I'm still an old fat guy, right?

23:00.670 --> 23:03.210
- I'm afraid so.
- Wait.

23:03.210 --> 23:07.470
Why is everybody okay with this?
I mean, she fell out of the sky.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.080
Um, guys?

23:12.650 --> 23:16.680
Bethany, get up.
Bethany, get up. Get up!

23:22.490 --> 23:24.020
Go, go, go!

23:24.020 --> 23:26.230
Go, go, go!

23:29.030 --> 23:33.130
Ah! Dr. Bravestone!
Welcome to Jumanji!

23:34.970 --> 23:37.530
Don't just stand there.
In you go.

23:37.530 --> 23:39.300
- Go, go, go.
- Yeah.

23:51.290 --> 23:52.620
Dr. Bravestone.

23:52.620 --> 23:55.650
Famed archaeologist
and international explorer.

23:55.650 --> 23:57.290
Known across
the seven continents

23:57.290 --> 23:59.160
for your courageous exploits.

23:59.160 --> 24:01.120
Is there a seat belt?

24:01.120 --> 24:04.230
I can't tell you what an honor
it is to finally meet you.

24:04.230 --> 24:07.560
I'm not embarrassed to say
you're more dashing in person.

24:07.570 --> 24:09.590
Um, thanks.

24:09.600 --> 24:10.700
Who are you?

24:10.700 --> 24:12.330
Nigel Billingsly
at your service,

24:12.340 --> 24:14.600
Ruby Roundhouse,
killer of men.

24:14.610 --> 24:16.300
Welcome to Jumanji.

24:16.300 --> 24:19.540
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

24:19.540 --> 24:21.640
As you know,
Jumanji is in grave danger.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.540
We're counting on the four
of you to lift the curse.

24:24.540 --> 24:26.280
- Curse?
- What curse?

24:26.280 --> 24:29.450
Excuse me.
Have you seen my phone anywhere?

24:29.450 --> 24:32.050
Professor Sheldon Oberon.

24:32.050 --> 24:33.580
Welcome to Jumanji.

24:33.580 --> 24:35.520
Nigel Billingsly
at your service.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.130
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

24:38.130 --> 24:39.650
What's with this guy?

24:39.650 --> 24:41.460
I think he's an NPC.

24:41.460 --> 24:42.990
A what? English, please.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.100
A non-player character.
He's part of the game.

24:45.100 --> 24:46.460
So anything we ask him,

24:46.470 --> 24:48.760
he only has his programmed
series of responses.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.500
Got it. It's all clear now.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.700
Franklin "Mouse" Finbar.

24:52.710 --> 24:54.260
Welcome to Jumanji.

24:54.270 --> 24:56.100
It's Moose. It's not Mouse.

24:56.100 --> 24:58.610
No, good sir.
I'm quite sure it's Mouse.

24:58.610 --> 25:00.180
- Mouse?
- A nickname given

25:00.180 --> 25:03.040
for your diminutive stature
and adorable manner.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.210
I knew you'd be here.

25:04.210 --> 25:06.050
Dr. Bravestone
doesn't go anywhere

25:06.050 --> 25:07.750
without his trusty sidekick.

25:07.750 --> 25:09.350
Sidekick?

25:09.360 --> 25:11.350
Ever since Dr. Bravestone
rescued you

25:11.350 --> 25:12.750
from the clutches
of a warlord

25:12.750 --> 25:15.590
in the jungles of Peru,
you've never left his side.

25:15.590 --> 25:16.760
Right.

25:16.760 --> 25:18.490
Can we go back
to the curse thing?

25:18.500 --> 25:21.030
It's all documented
in the letter I sent you.

25:21.030 --> 25:22.630
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

25:22.630 --> 25:24.200
I don't have a let...

25:27.600 --> 25:28.530
Whoa.

25:32.470 --> 25:34.170
Right, uh...

25:34.170 --> 25:36.510
"Dr. Bravestone,
I am writing to you

25:36.510 --> 25:38.610
"regarding
the desperate situation

25:38.610 --> 25:41.410
in Jumanji.
We need your help at once."

25:41.420 --> 25:44.380
- <i>Whoa... Guys?</i>
- <i>What's happening?</i>

25:44.380 --> 25:46.350
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

25:46.350 --> 25:48.710
<i>It's a cut scene.
A lot of games have them.</i>

25:48.720 --> 25:51.520
<i>It's like a little movie
to tell you the back-story.</i>

25:51.520 --> 25:53.620
<i>My name is
Nigel Billingsly,</i>

25:53.630 --> 25:56.130
<i>Jumanji field guide.</i>

25:56.130 --> 25:58.190
<i>I was hired
by your former partner,</i>

25:58.190 --> 26:00.830
<i>now nemesis,
Professor Russel Van Pelt</i>

26:00.830 --> 26:02.570
<i>to lead
a fateful expedition.</i>

26:06.270 --> 26:08.330
<i>You see,
Professor Van Pelt</i>

26:08.340 --> 26:10.670
<i>had come in search
of the fabled Jaguar Shrine,</i>

26:10.680 --> 26:14.340
<i>resting place
of the sacred jewel of Jumanji.</i>

26:14.340 --> 26:16.380
<i>As you know
better than anyone,</i>

26:16.380 --> 26:18.210
<i>the jewel was his
great obsession.</i>

26:18.210 --> 26:20.410
<i>And after years of research,
he believed</i>

26:20.420 --> 26:22.410
<i>that he had discovered
its whereabouts.</i>

26:22.410 --> 26:24.180
Could it be?

26:24.180 --> 26:26.290
Have I finally found it?

26:26.290 --> 26:29.480
<i>Van Pelt told me that
he wanted to find the jewel</i>

26:29.490 --> 26:32.190
<i>in order to document it
in his writings.</i>

26:34.430 --> 26:36.760
- It's real!
- <i>What I did not know</i>

26:36.760 --> 26:40.600
<i>was that he intended
to take the jewel for himself.</i>

26:49.540 --> 26:52.170
I found it.

26:52.170 --> 26:56.310
I found it!

26:57.850 --> 27:01.310
<i>Legend tells that the
Jaguar watches over Jumanji</i>

27:01.320 --> 27:03.480
<i>and anyone who dares
to blind him</i>

27:03.490 --> 27:07.060
<i>will be consumed
by a dark power.</i>

27:08.190 --> 27:10.190
<i>Van Pelt assumed dominion</i>

27:10.190 --> 27:12.290
<i>over all
of Jumanji's creatures,</i>

27:12.290 --> 27:15.590
<i>possessing them,
controlling them.</i>

27:15.590 --> 27:20.200
<i>And a terrible curse befell
this once-placid land.</i>

27:21.610 --> 27:23.630
<i>I begged him
to put it back,</i>

27:23.630 --> 27:25.770
<i>but once he had it
in his grasp,</i>

27:25.770 --> 27:29.580
<i>he could never let it go.</i>

27:29.580 --> 27:32.710
<i>So I waited
till they slept that night,</i>

27:32.710 --> 27:34.450
<i>and I made my move.</i>

27:56.300 --> 27:58.630
Bring me that jewel!

27:58.640 --> 28:02.230
And slaughter anyone
who tries to stop you.

28:03.270 --> 28:05.310
Right, then. Here you go.

28:06.640 --> 28:09.170
With the invaluable help
of your associates,

28:09.180 --> 28:10.940
you must use your
complementary skills

28:10.940 --> 28:12.910
to return the jewel
to the Jaguar's eye

28:12.910 --> 28:15.280
and lift the curse.

28:15.290 --> 28:17.610
I'm sure you'll want
to get started right away.

28:17.620 --> 28:19.520
- Actually, I think...
- Good luck!

28:19.520 --> 28:21.650
The fate of Jumanji
is in your hands.

28:23.590 --> 28:25.320
- What? Oh...
- And remember:

28:25.330 --> 28:27.560
<i>The goal for you,
I'll recite in verse</i>

28:27.560 --> 28:30.200
<i>Return the jewel
and lift the curse</i>

28:30.200 --> 28:31.770
<i>If you wish
to leave the game</i>

28:31.770 --> 28:36.330
<i>You must save Jumanji
And call out its name</i>

28:36.330 --> 28:39.310
Good luck! The fate
of Jumanji is in your hands.

28:39.310 --> 28:41.630
- He's saying the same thing over.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.270
<i>I'll recite in verse</i>

28:43.270 --> 28:45.410
<i>Return the jewel
and lift the curse</i>

28:45.410 --> 28:46.610
<i>If you wish
to leave the game</i>

28:46.610 --> 28:50.680
<i>You must save Jumanji
And call out its name</i>

28:53.590 --> 28:57.350
It's okay. You can handle this.
In real life, people love you.

28:57.350 --> 28:58.880
You can hook up
with anyone you want.

28:58.890 --> 29:01.560
Is that what you tell yourself
when you're scared?

29:01.560 --> 29:03.920
Can you not judge me
for two seconds?

29:03.930 --> 29:05.960
I split up with Noah,
I turned into a guy,

29:05.960 --> 29:08.700
and I cannot find my phone.
I am allowed to be upset.

29:08.700 --> 29:11.830
Dr. Bravestone,
here's a map of Jumanji.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.600
You must go to the bazaar
and find the missing piece.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.670
- The bazaar.
- Missing piece of what?

29:16.670 --> 29:18.670
- Cheerio!
- You can't give us a ride

29:18.680 --> 29:20.640
- to the statue?
- And remember:

29:20.640 --> 29:22.610
<i>If you wish
to leave the game</i>

29:22.610 --> 29:26.550
<i>You must save Jumanji
And call out its name</i>

29:33.790 --> 29:37.350
- You want to, uh, put this in there?
- No.

29:37.350 --> 29:40.430
Come on, you're the only one
with a backpack, Fridge.

29:41.390 --> 29:42.990
So what? We have a map.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.990
So now we're supposed
to go and find...?

29:44.990 --> 29:46.490
The bazaar, I guess?

29:46.500 --> 29:49.430
So we return the jewel
to the Jaguar statue,

29:49.440 --> 29:51.960
and then we go home.
No problem.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.900
Why can't we just leave,
stop the game,

29:53.900 --> 29:55.970
without doing
all this stuff?

29:55.970 --> 29:58.480
We have to finish the game.

29:59.700 --> 30:01.380
I think...

30:02.540 --> 30:05.480
I think we
have to save Jumanji.

30:13.530 --> 30:16.560
Damn, that is a man
right there.

30:18.730 --> 30:22.960
Don't
cry, don't cry, don't cry.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.030
Don't cry.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.500
Ah...

30:25.500 --> 30:28.300
There are so many diseases
out here.

30:28.300 --> 30:29.730
It's hot.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.970
Okay, this is
what I'm good at.

30:31.970 --> 30:34.370
Playing video games.
It's what I do.

30:34.370 --> 30:36.640
It's literally
the main thing that I do.

30:36.650 --> 30:38.700
Play a game like this,
there'll be levels.

30:38.710 --> 30:41.510
In order to finish, you gotta
complete all the levels.

30:41.510 --> 30:43.580
Levels are gonna get harder
as we go along.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.040
- We complete the levels...
- Do you

30:45.050 --> 30:46.880
even know
where we're going?

30:46.880 --> 30:48.750
- Kind of.
- Kind of?

30:48.750 --> 30:51.660
Oh, that's good, then.
We're in good hands.

30:51.660 --> 30:54.520
Okay, the missing piece,
I'm guessing.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.390
That must be
what we're looking for,

30:56.390 --> 30:57.660
the missing piece
of the map.

30:57.660 --> 30:59.700
The problem is,
there's nothing here.

31:01.790 --> 31:05.400
What do you mean?
It's a map, just like he said.

31:05.400 --> 31:06.810
It's a map of Jumanji.

31:08.110 --> 31:09.560
Cartography.

31:09.570 --> 31:11.570
- What's that?
- The study of maps.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.710
It was one of
Professor Oberon's skills.

31:13.710 --> 31:14.910
Yes. That's right.

31:14.910 --> 31:17.540
Oh, so you can't see this,
but I can?

31:17.540 --> 31:20.110
The characters we chose,
we all have certain skills.

31:20.110 --> 31:22.120
So there's gotta be
a way to access our...

31:23.650 --> 31:25.280
Oh!

31:26.720 --> 31:27.920
Wow.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.420
What'd you just do?

31:29.420 --> 31:31.680
"Strengths:
Fearless. Climbing.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.550
Speed. Boomerang.

31:33.560 --> 31:36.060
Smoldering intensity."

31:39.430 --> 31:41.660
What the hell are you doing?

31:41.660 --> 31:44.770
- What just happened?
- Um, you just smoldered.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.480
"Weakness.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.070
None"?

31:50.070 --> 31:52.810
How'd you do that?
That, uh, list?

31:52.810 --> 31:58.010
Well, I just... I think I just
pressed my enormous left pec.

31:58.010 --> 32:00.450
It's like the boob area.
Let me show you.

32:00.450 --> 32:01.650
Get away from me.

32:01.650 --> 32:03.450
At least press it
in front of us...

32:03.450 --> 32:05.580
...so we know exactly how...

32:05.580 --> 32:10.490
"Strengths: Karate. T'ai chi.
Aikido. Dance fighting"?

32:10.500 --> 32:12.860
Dance fighting?
Is that even a thing?

32:12.860 --> 32:14.730
"Weakness:

32:14.730 --> 32:16.000
Venom."

32:18.700 --> 32:20.730
Seriously?

32:20.730 --> 32:24.140
"Paleontology."
What does that even mean?

32:24.140 --> 32:26.870
Study of fossils, I think.

32:26.870 --> 32:29.840
- That's kind of cool.
- Says the gorgeous karate badass

32:29.840 --> 32:32.750
to the old fossil guy
who doesn't have any endurance.

32:37.180 --> 32:38.850
I hate this game.

32:38.850 --> 32:41.120
"Weakness: Cake."

32:41.120 --> 32:44.150
Yes, cake is my weakness.

32:44.150 --> 32:46.860
Along with speed
and strength.

32:46.860 --> 32:47.890
Huh...

32:47.890 --> 32:49.750
Strength is my weakness.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.120
Hey, can I...?
Quick question.

32:52.130 --> 32:53.930
How is strength my weakness?

32:53.930 --> 32:57.060
Somebody explain that to me.
And why would I need speed?

32:57.070 --> 32:59.760
Why would I need to be fast
when I'm being chased

32:59.770 --> 33:03.540
by an enormous killer zebra or
some shit in this dumb-ass hat?

33:03.540 --> 33:05.900
You're also
a good weapons valet.

33:05.900 --> 33:09.070
- What does that mean?
- Well, I think it means

33:09.080 --> 33:10.910
you carry my weapons
in your backpack,

33:10.910 --> 33:14.650
and you give them to me
when and if I need them?

33:15.810 --> 33:19.990
You guys. The map,
it's changing.

33:19.990 --> 33:21.190
What do you mean?

33:21.190 --> 33:22.780
- What's it say?
- Okay, well,

33:22.790 --> 33:24.220
there's not
a lot of information.

33:24.220 --> 33:27.190
But a minute ago, it didn't
say this and now it does.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.660
It says,
"The Mighty Roar."

33:38.530 --> 33:40.030
I don't like that.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.970
- I'm done.
- What else?

33:41.970 --> 33:45.870
Okay. And right here,
it says "From The Deep."

33:45.870 --> 33:48.180
The hippo came from the deep.
The one that...

33:48.180 --> 33:51.640
Yes, the thing that did
the thing. That's it. Moving on.

33:51.650 --> 33:53.850
So if "From The Deep"
is the first level,

33:53.850 --> 33:56.780
then "The Mighty Roar" must be
the second level.

33:56.790 --> 33:58.820
Which way?

33:58.820 --> 34:00.220
Okay.

34:00.220 --> 34:02.690
If that is that...

34:03.960 --> 34:06.500
and that is here...

34:07.160 --> 34:08.989
Right here, I think.

34:22.239 --> 34:23.770
What is this game?

34:25.239 --> 34:26.810
Run!

34:29.080 --> 34:30.620
Wait!

34:35.090 --> 34:36.960
Ha!

34:48.030 --> 34:49.770
Come on, legs!

34:52.600 --> 34:54.510
Why am I running so slow?

35:00.140 --> 35:02.050
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

35:07.180 --> 35:09.020
Aah!
This sucks!

35:10.220 --> 35:11.880
Split up!

35:25.990 --> 35:27.560
Oh, my God.

35:43.080 --> 35:44.810
Aah!

35:48.160 --> 35:49.210
Whoa.

35:49.220 --> 35:51.650
Come on!

35:51.650 --> 35:53.350
- Those guys have huge guns.
- Oh, really?

35:53.360 --> 35:54.920
Is that what
those are, Spencer?

35:54.930 --> 35:56.750
- Let me see your backpack.
- For what?

35:56.760 --> 35:58.960
Inside your backpack,
you have my weapons.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.100
Get down.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.330
Got your weapons?

36:05.330 --> 36:07.830
I can't feel no...
What's this?

36:07.830 --> 36:10.140
Oh, yes. Boomerang,
it's one of my strengths.

36:10.140 --> 36:11.660
What are you gonna do with it?

36:11.670 --> 36:13.200
I don't know.
Kill them, I guess.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.230
Kill them with that?

36:14.240 --> 36:15.340
You got a better idea?

36:15.340 --> 36:16.940
Oh, watch yourself.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.280
Watch this.

36:23.380 --> 36:25.650
- Nice work.
- There!

36:25.650 --> 36:27.380
Want me to see
if I got a hacky sack

36:27.390 --> 36:29.650
for you to throw
and do nothing with?

36:42.130 --> 36:43.400
Oh!

36:43.400 --> 36:46.100
- Wait, wait.
- Oh, no.

36:51.110 --> 36:52.700
It worked.

36:54.310 --> 36:55.940
Here they come. We gotta go.

36:55.950 --> 36:57.720
I can't outrun those guys.

36:59.410 --> 37:00.840
We gotta go now!

37:00.840 --> 37:02.880
- Get on my back.
- I would rather die.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.420
- Jump on my back!
- Nope. I'll die.

37:04.420 --> 37:06.150
Put me down!

37:06.160 --> 37:08.890
Spencer! Put me down!

37:18.300 --> 37:21.000
Whew!

37:21.000 --> 37:23.670
You have got
to be kidding me.

37:24.730 --> 37:27.110
Oh, no, no, no!

37:31.100 --> 37:33.140
- We have to jump!
- Are you out of your mind?

37:33.140 --> 37:35.440
I would rather do
anything else now but that.

37:35.450 --> 37:37.440
Jump!

37:37.450 --> 37:39.340
- Martha!
- Jump!

37:39.350 --> 37:42.890
We gotta jump!

37:42.890 --> 37:45.010
We don't know
how deep that water is.

37:45.020 --> 37:46.880
- We gotta go!
- No, no!

37:46.890 --> 37:50.760
- You gonna jump. Jump!
- No!

38:09.050 --> 38:11.040
Oh! I think
I'm having a coronary.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.780
I'm having difficulty
breathing.

38:12.780 --> 38:15.480
That was the most
humiliating moment of my life.

38:15.480 --> 38:17.480
Don't you do that again.

38:17.480 --> 38:19.310
I took in a lot of water.

38:24.290 --> 38:26.150
They got me.

38:26.150 --> 38:27.920
Oh, no.

38:29.060 --> 38:30.660
Martha?

38:35.030 --> 38:40.070
- Wait, what just happened to her?
- Is she dead? Did she die?

38:42.500 --> 38:44.940
Wait a second.

38:44.940 --> 38:47.170
What the hell is hap...?

38:47.180 --> 38:48.340
Ow!

38:48.350 --> 38:50.210
- Get off of my back!
- Are you okay?

38:50.210 --> 38:52.280
- I think so.
- Off of me!

38:52.280 --> 38:54.940
- Goodness gracious, get off!
- I'm getting off of you.

38:54.950 --> 38:56.180
Anybody care if I'm okay?

38:56.190 --> 38:58.220
What am I,
a human landing pad?

39:01.190 --> 39:02.490
That's what I thought.

39:02.490 --> 39:04.080
We each have
three lives, guys.

39:04.090 --> 39:06.990
These little tattoos
on our arms...

39:06.990 --> 39:09.530
Jesus, would you look
at the size of that thing?

39:09.530 --> 39:11.290
- Spencer!
- What?

39:11.300 --> 39:14.760
- You were saying?
- It's our life count.

39:14.770 --> 39:18.070
Bethany got eaten by a hippo,
so now she only has two lines.

39:18.070 --> 39:19.340
He's right.

39:19.340 --> 39:22.840
Wait. What happens
if we use up all our lives?

39:24.110 --> 39:26.720
Well, usually
that would mean...

39:28.140 --> 39:29.480
...game over.

39:29.480 --> 39:31.210
What do you mean,
"game over"?

39:31.210 --> 39:33.980
Are you saying that
we can actually die in here?

39:33.990 --> 39:35.850
I mean, I don't know
for sure, but...

39:35.850 --> 39:37.350
You're not sure?
You're not sure,

39:37.350 --> 39:40.290
- Mr. Video-Game-Genius?
- I've never been stuck in one!

39:40.290 --> 39:45.560
So I'm not certain, but, yes,
I'm afraid we all could die.

39:47.530 --> 39:50.070
That is my big concern
right now.

39:54.230 --> 39:56.570
We better find
the missing piece, then.

39:56.570 --> 39:58.740
Okay.

40:01.140 --> 40:02.840
It looks like
there's a village

40:02.840 --> 40:04.550
on the other side
of this mountain.

40:04.550 --> 40:06.570
Maybe that's the bazaar.

40:06.580 --> 40:09.050
- Let's do it.
- Wait.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.120
I gotta take a leak first.

40:12.120 --> 40:15.280
I've been
dreading this all day,

40:15.280 --> 40:17.890
but so do I.

40:17.890 --> 40:21.030
Can I come with you
and you show me how it's done?

40:21.990 --> 40:24.390
I may need your help.

40:24.390 --> 40:30.190
Uh, yeah, sure.
Yeah, I'm... I'll help you out.

40:32.530 --> 40:34.540
So how do we do this?

40:34.540 --> 40:36.460
Uh. Easy.
You just, uh...

40:36.470 --> 40:38.900
You unzip, take it out,
fire away.

40:38.900 --> 40:42.880
Remember to aim.
It's very important.

40:45.220 --> 40:47.480
My God, you guys,
there is literally a penis

40:47.480 --> 40:48.980
attached to my body
right now.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.590
Martha,
come look at my penis!

40:50.590 --> 40:52.380
No, thanks.

40:52.390 --> 40:55.220
- This the first you've seen it?
- Yes. I didn't wanna look.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.920
I looked at mine
the first 20 seconds here.

40:57.930 --> 40:59.390
I'm happy to report
that I was able

40:59.400 --> 41:01.930
to bring one thing
from the outside world.

41:02.990 --> 41:04.600
Are you...? What are you doing?

41:04.600 --> 41:05.960
- Are you looking?
- Sorry.

41:05.970 --> 41:07.230
You don't look over!

41:07.240 --> 41:09.460
Yeah, you never look.
It's a thing.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.370
Okay, good boy.

41:11.370 --> 41:13.370
We're gonna take this
nice and slow,

41:13.370 --> 41:14.640
and nobody's gonna get hurt.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.440
- Now what?
- Now blast off.

41:16.440 --> 41:17.940
And aim.
Don't forget to aim.

41:17.940 --> 41:20.040
What is with you and aiming?
What happened?

41:20.040 --> 41:21.650
Can we not talk about this?

41:21.650 --> 41:24.540
Wow, wow, wow!

41:24.540 --> 41:26.950
Oh, this is
so much easier!

41:26.950 --> 41:28.450
It's cool, right?

41:28.450 --> 41:31.080
Yeah, because you have,
like, a handle.

41:31.090 --> 41:33.550
The fact that I'm not
Instagramming this

41:33.550 --> 41:35.260
right now is insane.

41:38.130 --> 41:40.220
- This looks all right.
- Up ahead!

42:00.650 --> 42:02.110
Bravestone.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.180
Him and that whole lot.

42:05.450 --> 42:06.890
They got away?

42:07.650 --> 42:09.260
We lost them in the jungle.

42:10.130 --> 42:12.020
I should have known.

42:14.460 --> 42:17.030
H-how do you mean, sir?

42:17.030 --> 42:20.290
I will summon every creature
and every soldier

42:20.300 --> 42:22.360
to hunt them down.

42:22.360 --> 42:25.110
Reclaim what is mine.

42:28.440 --> 42:29.870
Find them.

42:33.510 --> 42:35.440
Be careful
of the ground, guys.

42:35.440 --> 42:38.180
It's uneven. I'd hate
for anybody to twist an ankle.

42:38.180 --> 42:40.350
- I did that once...
- Please stop talking?

42:40.350 --> 42:42.950
- Okay, sure. No problem.
- Please!

42:42.950 --> 42:44.650
- Can I borrow your jacket?
- Yeah, sure.

42:44.650 --> 42:46.150
- Thanks.
- What are you doing?

42:46.160 --> 42:48.420
I feel like I'm wearing
a bikini at school.

42:48.430 --> 42:50.690
I did that once.
They sent me to the office.

42:50.690 --> 42:52.120
Of course.

42:52.120 --> 42:53.990
Noah likes it
when I show some skin.

42:53.990 --> 42:55.700
It's like the key
to our relationship.

42:55.700 --> 42:57.420
Ew.

42:57.430 --> 43:01.300
Judgy much? Seriously, I can't
even open my mouth around you.

43:01.300 --> 43:04.700
You don't even know me, but you,
like, decided you hate me.

43:04.710 --> 43:07.200
Oh, wait a minute.
I don't hate you.

43:09.010 --> 43:11.280
- You don't?
- No.

43:11.280 --> 43:13.570
Look, I just think
you live in, like,

43:13.570 --> 43:15.040
the "hot popular girl"
bubble.

43:15.040 --> 43:16.610
Where everybody
either treats you

43:16.610 --> 43:18.680
like a princess
or like an object.

43:18.690 --> 43:23.920
Maybe it makes you a little...
self-absorbed or something?

43:27.090 --> 43:28.980
That's fair.

43:28.990 --> 43:31.090
But do you think maybe
the reason why you're

43:31.090 --> 43:33.600
so judgy is because
you're, like, afraid that

43:33.600 --> 43:35.070
people aren't gonna
like you,

43:35.070 --> 43:37.130
so you decide
not to like them first?

43:37.130 --> 43:39.170
No.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.040
Maybe. Maybe.

43:44.010 --> 43:46.200
Okay, then.

43:46.200 --> 43:49.080
I'm just saying,
you're a babe. Own it.

43:51.250 --> 43:52.710
Thanks.

43:52.710 --> 43:54.680
I guess.

44:01.420 --> 44:04.490
So sick of this game.
Just stay out of my way, Spencer.

44:04.490 --> 44:06.330
What are you mad at me for?

44:06.330 --> 44:08.450
Why? Are you
seriously asking me that?

44:08.460 --> 44:10.260
You got me
kicked off the team.

44:10.260 --> 44:13.500
Then you got me stuck in
whatever... Whatever this is.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.530
And you wonder
why we not friends no more.

44:15.530 --> 44:17.460
This is why
we're not friends anymore?

44:17.470 --> 44:20.300
You didn't wanna get stuck
in Jumanji? I don't think so.

44:20.300 --> 44:22.430
We're not friends
because I'm not cool enough

44:22.440 --> 44:24.370
to hang out with you,
so you pretended

44:24.370 --> 44:26.610
not to even know me anymore,
until you needed me

44:26.610 --> 44:29.280
to do your homework because
you couldn't do it yourself.

44:29.280 --> 44:30.810
No wonder
you don't know anything

44:30.810 --> 44:32.210
about westward expansion.

44:32.210 --> 44:34.580
Okay, you see that?
You know what?

44:34.580 --> 44:36.190
I'm not stupid,
Spencer.

44:36.190 --> 44:38.250
I asked you to do me
one simple favor.

44:38.260 --> 44:39.620
Do my homework, so I don't

44:39.620 --> 44:42.220
get kicked off the team,
and you messed that up.

44:42.220 --> 44:44.530
Now I can't do the one thing
that I'm good at,

44:44.530 --> 44:46.790
and it's all your fault.

44:46.790 --> 44:49.230
I should kick
the shit out you right now.

44:57.470 --> 44:58.600
I'd like to see you try.

44:58.600 --> 45:00.010
What did you say?

45:01.810 --> 45:04.270
Oh, okay.

45:04.270 --> 45:05.810
I see what's going on here.

45:05.810 --> 45:07.450
Guys.

45:07.450 --> 45:09.810
You think because you...
You, what, 6'4", 6'5",

45:09.810 --> 45:11.340
270 pounds of pure muscle,

45:11.340 --> 45:13.120
I'm supposed
to be afraid of you?

45:13.120 --> 45:14.490
Is that what you think?

45:15.790 --> 45:17.160
Maybe.

45:21.320 --> 45:23.290
Let me tell you something.

45:23.300 --> 45:25.090
You're still
the same annoying kid

45:25.100 --> 45:27.430
I've been trying to shake
since seventh grade.

45:28.530 --> 45:30.230
Ain't nothing changed.

45:30.230 --> 45:33.430
Don't let this new body
get your butt whupped.

45:38.740 --> 45:40.210
Dumb-ass.

45:46.380 --> 45:47.810
- No!
- Spencer!

45:47.820 --> 45:49.640
Spencer!

45:49.650 --> 45:52.250
- You killed him!
- Fridge, you lunatic!

45:52.250 --> 45:54.420
Chill out. He'll be back.

46:12.270 --> 46:14.100
Don't call me a dumb-ass.

46:14.870 --> 46:17.170
Don't push me.

46:17.170 --> 46:18.580
Or what, Spencer?

46:18.580 --> 46:20.440
Or I'll push you back.

46:28.850 --> 46:30.350
- Oh!
- Oh!

46:32.920 --> 46:34.460
Did you just smack me?

46:35.820 --> 46:37.520
You gonna smack me?

46:37.520 --> 46:40.930
- Fridge, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

46:40.930 --> 46:42.660
Huh? You wanna smack...?

46:43.700 --> 46:45.360
Oh, no, no, no!

46:46.530 --> 46:47.500
Enough.

46:48.770 --> 46:50.480
We can't waste lives.

46:51.370 --> 46:53.170
We need each other.

46:53.170 --> 46:57.700
Like it or not,
we have to do this together.

47:00.910 --> 47:02.750
Could you say that
one more time, please?

47:02.750 --> 47:05.580
- We have to do this together?
- But with the smolder.

47:05.590 --> 47:09.450
Do you have control of that,
or does that happen naturally?

47:09.450 --> 47:11.450
It just happens naturally.

47:40.510 --> 47:42.280
What are we supposed
to be doing?

47:42.280 --> 47:43.850
Looking for
the missing map piece.

47:43.850 --> 47:45.540
So we just start
asking for it?

47:45.550 --> 47:48.220
No, I think we look around,
scope the place out,

47:48.220 --> 47:50.290
but most importantly, guys,

47:50.290 --> 47:52.200
be discreet.

47:52.960 --> 47:55.690
Rations! Get your rations!

47:55.690 --> 47:58.400
Does anyone have any money?
I'm literally starving.

47:58.400 --> 48:01.530
Rations! Get your rations!

48:01.530 --> 48:03.660
Rations!

48:03.670 --> 48:05.940
Guys, I think the game
is trying to tell us

48:05.940 --> 48:07.000
to keep our health up.

48:07.010 --> 48:08.970
We need to eat.

48:08.970 --> 48:10.700
Okay, stop doing that.

48:10.700 --> 48:12.310
Oh, my God, this is so good.

48:12.310 --> 48:14.310
I haven't had bread
since I was, like, 9.

48:14.310 --> 48:15.450
Are you serious?

48:15.450 --> 48:17.540
How do you think
I got these abs?

48:17.540 --> 48:19.480
Let me try some of that.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.190
Mm.

48:23.420 --> 48:25.750
Wait, what...?
What is this?

48:25.750 --> 48:27.020
That's my famous pound cake.

48:28.020 --> 48:30.260
Cake?

48:30.260 --> 48:31.720
Bethany, you said
this was bread.

48:31.730 --> 48:34.320
It's been so long,
I forgot what it tastes like.

48:34.330 --> 48:35.790
How do you forget what...?

48:35.800 --> 48:38.000
What's hap...
Something happening to me?

48:38.000 --> 48:39.530
- No.
- Am I... Am I shaking?

48:39.540 --> 48:41.000
- Huh-uh.
- Am I breaking out?

48:41.000 --> 48:42.860
No.

48:42.870 --> 48:45.040
- Am I still black?
- Yes.

48:45.040 --> 48:48.740
Okay. Okay, right?

48:48.740 --> 48:50.910
We're fine.
Everything is fine.

48:50.910 --> 48:52.410
Yeah, no, no, no,
it's okay.

48:52.410 --> 48:54.380
It probably just meant
that I love cake.

48:54.380 --> 48:56.340
That I couldn't resist it.
Yeah.

48:56.340 --> 48:58.450
Hey, it's all good...

49:11.860 --> 49:13.030
God!

49:13.030 --> 49:15.930
Oh! Ow!

49:15.930 --> 49:17.710
What the hell? Ugh!

49:19.000 --> 49:20.930
Like I said,
important to be discreet.

49:20.930 --> 49:22.400
Hey, you also said eat.

49:22.400 --> 49:24.040
Rations!
Get your...

49:24.040 --> 49:25.680
You better
shut your ass up!

49:27.370 --> 49:29.770
Dr. Bravestone.
Thank goodness you're here.

49:29.780 --> 49:30.980
Jumanji needs you.

49:30.980 --> 49:34.710
Uh. Thanks. Good to be here.

49:34.710 --> 49:36.380
Ask about
the missing piece.

49:36.380 --> 49:38.520
Oh, right.
Hi. I'm Bethany.

49:38.520 --> 49:41.680
I mean...
Professor Shelly, something.

49:41.690 --> 49:43.080
I'm a map doctor,

49:43.080 --> 49:46.660
and I have this map that,
like, has a missing piece.

49:46.660 --> 49:49.020
Dr. Bravestone.
Thank goodness you're here.

49:49.030 --> 49:50.360
Jumanji needs you.

49:50.360 --> 49:51.630
Rude.

49:51.630 --> 49:54.400
We need to find
the missing piece.

50:27.930 --> 50:31.560
<i>What you need
is in the basket</i>

50:31.560 --> 50:34.370
<i>One false move,
you're in a casket</i>

50:34.370 --> 50:37.700
<i>Trust one another,
and never blink</i>

50:37.700 --> 50:41.540
<i>The missing piece
is not what you think</i>

50:42.680 --> 50:43.910
Oy vey.

50:43.910 --> 50:45.810
Good luck, mighty hero.

50:45.810 --> 50:48.110
- Jumanji needs you.
- Jumanji needs him. We know.

50:48.110 --> 50:50.320
You said it several times.

50:55.720 --> 50:59.680
So thinking there's a, um...

50:59.690 --> 51:02.150
A snake in there
or something?

51:02.160 --> 51:03.590
Yep.

51:03.590 --> 51:05.500
Sounds like
a Bravestone thing to me.

51:05.500 --> 51:07.390
Why would this be
a Bravestone thing?

51:07.400 --> 51:09.160
You're the hero.
You heard what he said.

51:09.160 --> 51:10.770
"Jumanji needs you."
Now, get.

51:26.550 --> 51:28.420
I don't wanna do this!

51:28.420 --> 51:29.580
Just go.

51:50.970 --> 51:52.470
Black mamba!

51:52.470 --> 51:54.430
That's a black mamba.

51:54.440 --> 51:56.970
A quarter milligram of its venom
is enough to kill an adult.

51:56.970 --> 51:59.170
You'll feel a tingling
in your mouth and extremities,

51:59.180 --> 52:01.710
followed by a fever, foaming
at the mouth, and ataxia,

52:01.720 --> 52:03.470
which means
loss of muscle control.

52:03.480 --> 52:05.040
- How do I know that?
- What do we do?

52:05.050 --> 52:07.520
- See anything else in there?
- I didn't have time.

52:07.520 --> 52:08.920
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

52:08.920 --> 52:11.620
"Trust one another
and never blink." Never blink.

52:11.620 --> 52:14.690
You guys, I think
it's a staring contest.

52:14.690 --> 52:16.190
- What?
- What are you talking about?

52:16.200 --> 52:19.120
- Think about it. "Never blink"?
- Guys, I think she's right.

52:19.120 --> 52:20.790
At camp,
they used to tell us

52:20.790 --> 52:23.100
if you see a rattlesnake,
don't move. I think someone

52:23.100 --> 52:25.790
has to make direct eye contact
and not blink.

52:25.800 --> 52:27.730
And then Spencer
will reach in and grab

52:27.730 --> 52:30.200
- whatever else is in there.
- What? Why me again?

52:30.200 --> 52:32.530
- Because you're Bravestone.
- Okay, fine.

52:32.540 --> 52:35.910
Who's good at staring
and not blinking?

52:37.840 --> 52:39.110
I'm amazing at it.

52:39.110 --> 52:41.080
Then this is your moment.

52:44.210 --> 52:46.550
Come on, Bethany.

52:51.090 --> 52:52.420
Okay.

52:55.830 --> 52:56.960
Just say when.

52:59.830 --> 53:00.930
Now.

53:09.170 --> 53:11.170
Oh!

53:11.180 --> 53:13.440
What do we do?

53:16.140 --> 53:17.210
You gotta defang it.

53:17.210 --> 53:19.840
I gotta what?

53:19.850 --> 53:21.540
You gotta pull
his mouth back

53:21.550 --> 53:23.510
from the blind spot
to disorient it.

53:23.520 --> 53:25.520
But be very careful
of the venom gland

53:25.520 --> 53:27.620
and the exposed
secondary venom duct.

53:27.630 --> 53:29.150
Then you gotta
snap its teeth...

53:31.730 --> 53:33.220
...out of its head.

53:33.230 --> 53:35.860
Oh, oh!

53:38.000 --> 53:40.730
I guess it wasn't
a staring contest.

53:40.730 --> 53:44.000
"Trust each other
and never blink."

53:44.000 --> 53:46.070
You trusted me.

53:46.070 --> 53:48.270
You trusted me,
and I defanged the snake.

53:48.270 --> 53:50.210
I did it.
I did that.

53:50.210 --> 53:52.840
Yeah.
Yeah, you did it.

53:52.840 --> 53:54.280
Thank you.

53:54.280 --> 53:56.880
Oh, yeah. Sure.

54:07.180 --> 54:08.820
You guys?

54:08.820 --> 54:11.290
This does not look like
a piece of a map.

54:11.290 --> 54:14.720
The missing piece
is an elephant?

54:14.720 --> 54:17.690
Oh, wait, there's something
written on the wrapping paper.

54:17.700 --> 54:21.000
"When you see me,
begin the climb."

54:21.000 --> 54:24.900
"Begin the climb"?
When you see an elephant?

54:27.040 --> 54:28.910
I defanged a snake.

54:30.710 --> 54:33.840
So keep your eyes
peeled for an elephant, I guess?

54:33.850 --> 54:36.120
That's, like,
the next level of the game?

54:42.360 --> 54:43.790
Hey!

54:43.790 --> 54:45.090
Run!

54:49.360 --> 54:51.660
Oh, God.

54:51.660 --> 54:53.690
Watch out!

54:56.030 --> 54:57.130
Jump!

54:57.130 --> 54:58.940
- Jump.
- Go, go, go!

54:59.810 --> 55:00.970
Hey!

55:07.210 --> 55:12.010
I have to warn you, I think
I'm a very strong puncher.

55:12.010 --> 55:13.080
Parry.

55:14.220 --> 55:16.910
Parry. Parry. Evade. Block.

55:16.920 --> 55:18.210
Uppercut.

55:21.050 --> 55:23.130
Oh. Oh.

55:24.230 --> 55:25.950
Duck! Head smash!

55:28.190 --> 55:29.190
Kerpow!

55:32.000 --> 55:34.060
Duck! Block!

55:34.060 --> 55:35.570
Ka-blam!

55:36.970 --> 55:39.630
Evade! Punch!

55:39.640 --> 55:42.270
Wall toss!

55:42.270 --> 55:44.680
That is insane.

55:52.180 --> 55:54.940
Let's do this.

55:54.950 --> 55:55.910
Do what?

55:57.320 --> 56:00.020
Put... Put it
in my backpack.

56:01.060 --> 56:03.750
Dodge! Head slam!

56:03.750 --> 56:04.990
Throw through ceiling!

56:13.930 --> 56:15.040
- Ah! - Ah!
- Ah!

56:30.280 --> 56:32.750
Hello, doctor.

56:32.750 --> 56:34.850
Been a long time.

56:37.390 --> 56:41.160
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

56:42.370 --> 56:44.060
We just wanna go home.

56:49.170 --> 56:51.400
Come on! Come with me! Hurry!

56:51.400 --> 56:52.770
Get him!

57:00.240 --> 57:01.710
Come on.

57:05.780 --> 57:08.680
Down here.
Come on. Quick!

57:24.460 --> 57:25.930
Shh!

57:25.930 --> 57:27.300
Okay.

57:27.300 --> 57:30.300
I need you to follow me
and do exactly as I say.

57:30.300 --> 57:33.170
Let's move.

57:33.170 --> 57:35.910
Oh, my God, you guys,
I am so stoked you are here.

57:35.910 --> 57:38.240
- You have no idea. So stoked.
- You are?

57:38.240 --> 57:40.240
I mean, I saw you
guys in the bazaar,

57:40.240 --> 57:42.080
and I thought
to myself, "No way."

57:42.080 --> 57:43.870
Then I was like,
yeah, that's...

57:43.880 --> 57:45.810
Backs against the wall!

57:47.350 --> 57:48.820
Oh, my goodness!

57:51.260 --> 57:52.950
Let's keep moving.

57:54.120 --> 57:56.490
- Watch your step in here.
- Um, who are you?

57:56.490 --> 57:57.960
And who do you think
we are?

57:57.960 --> 57:59.960
Right.
Sorry, okay, my bad.

57:59.970 --> 58:02.020
Um. Let me back up
a little bit here.

58:02.030 --> 58:04.200
Wait, are you the pilot?
"Seaplane" somebody?

58:04.200 --> 58:06.130
- Yeah, that's me.
- Wait a minute.

58:06.140 --> 58:08.200
You're the other
character that was taken.

58:08.210 --> 58:11.370
- So you're in the game too?
- Stay off the white bricks...

58:11.370 --> 58:12.840
- What?
- And freeze.

58:12.840 --> 58:14.510
- Aah!
- Oh!

58:20.180 --> 58:22.520
So gnarly.

58:22.520 --> 58:25.120
This game sucks.

58:27.220 --> 58:28.820
Hup!

58:33.990 --> 58:37.000
All right. Get this plank.

58:41.360 --> 58:43.900
Follow me.

58:43.900 --> 58:46.430
Careful.
It's a horrible way to die.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.740
Oh, God.

58:50.310 --> 58:51.910
There you go. All right.

58:58.820 --> 59:00.180
Come on.

59:01.590 --> 59:04.110
I got it, I got it.
I just defanged a snake.

59:04.120 --> 59:06.050
Give me
a little respect.

59:11.150 --> 59:13.160
Okay.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.780
- Hi there.
- Hi.

59:30.910 --> 59:32.350
Come on.

59:45.020 --> 59:47.920
Anyway, I'm Alex.

59:47.930 --> 59:49.990
Spencer Gilpin.

59:49.990 --> 59:53.090
Martha, Fridge and Bethany.

59:53.090 --> 59:55.460
Bethany? You're a girl?

59:55.470 --> 59:58.030
Woman.

59:58.030 --> 01:00:00.270
In real life, you'd probably
wanna hit that.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:09.810
They got away.
Looks like they had help.

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:12.570
Seaplane.

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:14.850
He must've crawled out
of his hole.

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.350
I'm sorry, boss.

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:20.290
It won't happen again.

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:25.490
I know it won't.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.140
What are you making?

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:43.300
Margaritas. It's actually
one of my strengths.

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:46.040
That and piloting,
although I did get shot down

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.280
by a couple orangutans
in fighter jets,

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.420
so maybe not
that great at it.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.440
Anyway, cheers.

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:55.220
Ah.

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.950
- Oh. Thanks.
- Sure.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.450
I've never
had alcohol before.

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.520
- Me either.
- Know what?

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.890
- What the hell? Woo!
- Lehayim.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.130
- And I'm done with that.
- It's good.

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:14.560
Can I get one more of those?

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:15.930
- Yeah.
- Alex?

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:17.330
What's up with
all these candles?

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.240
ALEX? Citronella. One
of my weaknesses

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.070
is mosquitoes,
which is kind of a bummer

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.500
when you live alone
in an open hut in the jungle.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:27.110
He's single.

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:29.380
Who's this?

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.980
Who's Alan Parrish?

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.410
He's the guy
who built this place.

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:36.390
Wait, other people have
been stuck here too?

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:39.280
Yeah. This is Alan Parrish's
house. I'm just living in it.

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:41.420
So, Alex, tell me,

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:44.090
how long have
you been in the game?

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.590
Oh, it's tough to say.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.690
Time is kind of funny here.

01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:49.160
But a few months, at least.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.560
- A few months?
- What?

01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:52.070
Yeah,
I can't seem to make it

01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:53.560
past the transportation shed.

01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:55.530
Transportation shed?
What's that?

01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:57.270
It's the next level.

01:01:57.270 --> 01:02:00.040
First time, my hot-air balloon
wouldn't even take off.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.940
And then there was the whole
plane thing I mentioned.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.680
And once I got down
to my last life,

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.550
I realized I was screwed.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.380
And that I was never gonna
get out of here by myself.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:15.360
Half the stuff that came at me,
I had zero way to deal with.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.520
You can't kill a black mamba
with a margarita.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.430
You sure can't.
You need a zoologist for that.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.620
Alex, we can help each other.

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:28.230
You've been here a long time,
you know the game,

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:30.330
and between us,
we have a lot of strengths.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:33.330
Yeah. We're actually
pretty good together.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.070
I don't know, bro.

01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:39.380
Okay, I mess up
one more time, I'm toast.

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.400
Totally freaks me out
even thinking about

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:43.450
going back to
the transportation shed.

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.250
I don't wanna die
in Jumanji.

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.140
We just gotta stick together.

01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:51.250
If we do that, we can win.
I know we can.

01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:56.520
Oh, my God.
You're our missing piece.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.590
You were the thing
we needed to find.

01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:01.090
So the clue was to, what,

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.520
go to the bazaar
to find the missing piece?

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.360
It wasn't the elephant.

01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:09.500
- It was me.
- Yeah.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.210
Dudes, let's do this.

01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:16.510
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:19.040
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:21.170
Hey, Spencer,
you gonna drink that margarita?

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.380
I... You're done.

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.650
This is one good margarita.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.480
There it is. The
transportation shed.

01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:37.590
There's all sorts
of vehicles inside.

01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:39.800
We gotta get one,
get across the canyon,

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.530
and get to the Jaguar statue.

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.560
Okay, I see
the transportation shed,

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.230
I see the canyon, but
I still can't see the statue,

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.370
which is weird 'cause
it's the most important thing

01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:50.610
in Jumanji and it's huge.

01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:52.070
That's what she said.

01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:56.210
You drunk, Fridge?

01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:58.270
What are you talking about?
I ain't drunk.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.210
- He is drunk.
- I had three little margaritas.

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:02.810
You're about
half your usual size.

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.420
Whatever, whatever.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:07.180
Alex, what do we do?
How do we get past these guards?

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.820
Last time,
I waited till they left.

01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:10.150
How long did that take?

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:12.690
- Three weeks?
- Oh, we gonna die.

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.450
Okay. Plan B.

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:16.360
Maybe there's
another door somewhere.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.200
But we gotta distract
those guys first.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.570
I've got it.

01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:23.130
Distracting guys is, like,
the main thing I do.

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:24.700
He plays video games,
I distract guys.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.470
Bethany, I hate to break it
to you right now,

01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:30.670
but you don't exactly
have the, um, the tool kit.

01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:35.180
- Not me.
- What?

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:37.840
- You have to go down there and flirt with those guys...
- No.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.310
- ...and hold their attention while we sneak in.
- No!

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.150
I can't just go over there
and flirt

01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:43.720
with some weird soldiers
I don't know.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.350
I know, but right now
we don't have a better idea.

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:49.590
You don't understand.
I actually can't do it.

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:52.690
I can't talk to guys.

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.520
I'm terrible at it.

01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:57.200
I can give you some pointers.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.760
No, I'm sorry. We
have to come up with another plan.

01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:04.600
I'm not... No. Heh.
Not doing that.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.240
Martha, you just have to
distract them long enough

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.510
for us
to get into the shed.

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:10.400
I really don't think
I can, I'm not...

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:14.480
Like, I'm not actually
some badass girl.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:18.210
What are you talking about?
You're a total badass.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.130
You could do anything.

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:30.630
That's beautiful, Spencer.

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:33.460
Why don't I set you up
with a nice candlelight dinner?

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:36.470
Or do you guys wanna get
the hell out of here?

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:37.870
All right.

01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:39.860
Show me how it's done.

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:41.900
Class is in session.

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.370
- Come on, girl.
- Okay.

01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:45.340
Watch and learn.

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.840
Hey, what did you mean by
that candlelight-dinner thing?

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.640
- What are you talking about?
- You said it, me and Martha,

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.950
candlelight dinner.
What does that even mean?

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:55.310
The girl is into you,
Spencer.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.610
What?

01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:07.720
Okay, in flirting
situations,

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:09.460
the key is making them
check you out

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:10.800
without letting them know

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.730
that you know that
they're checking you out.

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:15.270
You're like, "Whatever."
When they try to talk to you,

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:16.800
you can play it
one of three ways:

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.360
dumb, super into it,
or nasty.

01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:21.840
Which way you play it depends on
what guy you deal with.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.680
This is like my dream and my
nightmare all at one time.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.640
I'm not gonna
take that personally.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.470
Now, hair is everything.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.550
Touch it. Move it.
Play with it.

01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:34.610
Move it around a lot.
Hypnotize them with it.

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:38.350
Give me a flip like that.
Okay, now angle your eyes down.

01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:39.650
Now, head down.

01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.360
Tilt up. Eyes big.

01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:43.590
- Now sparkle.
- Sparkle?

01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:45.860
Like an anime character.
Now sparkle.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.700
Needs work.

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.540
Do you really think
she likes me?

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.370
Why are we still
talking about this?

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:06.310
I mean, what if
she tries to kiss me?

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:07.780
Then you just
kiss her back, man.

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.420
What if she tries
to kiss me, like...

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.550
Like, without warning?

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.620
What are you talking about?
Haven't you ever kissed anyone?

01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:17.590
Don't... You gonna tell
the whole jungle?

01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:19.530
Guys, I found
a side door. Over here.

01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:21.650
- Guess what I found.
- No, no, don't tell him.

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:23.420
Okay, let's talk about
your walk.

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:24.790
Take your time.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.960
Make a meal of it.
Like a gorgeous gazelle.

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:31.300
Or a horse. High-step it.
One foot in front of the other.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:33.270
And bring it.
Boom, boom...

01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:34.600
That's not it.

01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:35.910
Yikes.

01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:38.470
Anything you can do to
draw attention to the lips.

01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:39.740
A little nibble like this.

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:42.780
A nibble goes
a long way, girlfriend.

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.010
Good. That's better.

01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:46.880
Now smile.
You look terrified.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.410
Oh, God,
you're so funny.

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:50.490
- You're so funny.
- Oh, God, you're so funny.

01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:52.480
Oh, my God,
you're so funny.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.050
- I think I'm getting it.
- You are getting it. Go, girl.

01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:57.360
Now, keep your lips
slightly parted, like...

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.390
Yeah, not-not gross,
just relaxed.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.290
Touch your tongue
to the roof of your mouth.

01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:03.290
- Like this.
- Like this?

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.960
- Like this.
- Like this?

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.590
Like this.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.560
Like this.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.400
Like this?

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:12.770
I think you're ready.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.900
- Cool.
- Okay, flirt

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:17.770
like our lives depend on it.

01:08:17.770 --> 01:08:18.910
'Cause they do.

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:20.510
Okay, there's the door.

01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:22.640
We just need something
to cut through the fence.

01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:25.510
Okay, Fridge, you got anything
like that in the backpack?

01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:28.380
Uh, yeah, I should. What...?

01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:31.580
Here you go. I got some...
Some bolt cutters.

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:34.050
Does that seem like a good tool
for the situation?

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.359
Perfect, actually.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:38.020
It's called backpack power,
baby.

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.390
You guys,

01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:43.029
I think this is gonna work.

01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:44.930
I think so too.
She's pretty fly.

01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:47.630
And those guys don't meet
a lot of new people.

01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:48.729
"Fly"?

01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:50.540
Well, not like
Cindy Crawford fly,

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.810
but for Jumanji,
she the bomb.

01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:54.340
"The bomb"?

01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:56.069
- Cindy Crawford?
- That's your go-to?

01:08:56.069 --> 01:08:57.569
I'm just saying, I'm sure

01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:59.649
they'd like to
get jiggy with her.

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:05.550
Alex.

01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:08.560
What year do you think it is?

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.819
- What do you mean?
- Oh, no.

01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:14.330
It's 1996.

01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:19.520
You're Alex Vreeke,
aren't you?

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:20.830
Yeah, that's right.

01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:22.729
Wait a minute,
you mean Freak House?

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:25.500
Wait, what are you...
What are you guys talking about?

01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:26.600
How do you know me?

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.740
Alex, I don't know how
to tell you this...

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.670
You've been in this game
for 20 years.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.670
That's probably not
how I would've done it.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.040
What?

01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:39.120
No. You guys are messing
with me, right?

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.109
No, we're not.
Alex Vreeke.

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:43.510
Everybody in Brantford
knows about you.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.420
You're the kid
that disappeared.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.979
Twenty years ago.

01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:49.950
Twenty years?

01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:52.720
Twenty years, man.

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:55.460
I don't even know
how to say this, but

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:57.660
Cindy Crawford, dude,
she's like 50 years old.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.970
- But still fly.
- Eh.

01:10:00.970 --> 01:10:03.470
Wait...

01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:09.640
There she is.

01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:18.820
Hey.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:22.880
We're gonna get you home.

01:10:22.890 --> 01:10:25.550
Yeah.

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.740
The hell is
going on with her butt?

01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.680
Bethany, what did
you tell her to do?

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.740
Did she twist her ankle,
maybe, or...?

01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:53.980
She's never flirted before.
Give her a break.

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.880
Hello, little lady.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.920
What are you doing
out here all alone?

01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:06.950
Hey, you guys.

01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:09.520
I seem to be lost.

01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:12.060
Can you guys help me?

01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:16.830
Hello, little lady.

01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:18.940
What are you doing
out here all alone?

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.900
You guys are so
interesting and funny.

01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:26.210
What's she doing?

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:28.240
What, she got a bug
in her hair?

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.810
She's forgotten
all of our training.

01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:32.410
Let's go.

01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:39.680
Wait! I... I... I
have to tell you

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.990
about this book
that I've been reading.

01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:43.920
About microbiology.

01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:47.930
Which is one of
my favorite biologies.

01:11:54.230 --> 01:11:55.900
Hello, little lady.

01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:59.170
What are you doing
out here all alone?

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:07.550
You are a badass.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:13.520
<i>? Ooh, baby
I love your way?</i>

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:16.980
<i>? Every day, yeah?</i>

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.580
Hey.

01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:20.150
You guys like to dance?

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.020
<i>? ...every day?</i>

01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:28.130
<i>? Shadows grow so long
Before my eyes?</i>

01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:29.300
<i>? And they're moving?</i>

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:32.160
Oh, yeah, there we go.

01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:34.930
<i>? Across the page?</i>

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:39.930
<i>? Suddenly the day
Turns into night?</i>

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:41.240
<i>? Ooh?</i>

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:47.110
<i>? Far away from the city?</i>

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.540
Which one,
which one, which one?

01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:53.620
I hate this place.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:57.720
<i>? 'Cause your love
Just won't...?</i>

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.220
Her strength is dance fighting.

01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:03.020
Alex, what do you think, huh?
What's the move?

01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:04.690
- What?
- What do we take?

01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:06.590
- Which one?
- I don't know, man, okay?

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.030
- I told you, I...
- We gotta fly.

01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:09.830
The helicopter? We gotta fly.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.110
I told you I don't know.

01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:14.570
<i>? ...light the skies?</i>

01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:22.040
<i>? With the help
Of some fireflies?</i>

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.910
She's kicking their ass.

01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:25.180
That's our girl.

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:27.270
Yes, queen!

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.150
<i>? ...the power to shine?</i>

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:35.080
<i>? I can see them
Under the pine?</i>

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.120
She is destroying them.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.290
<i>? But don't hesitate?</i>

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.920
<i>? La di dah?</i>

01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:44.360
<i>? 'Cause your love?</i>

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.330
<i>? Just won't wait?</i>

01:13:47.770 --> 01:13:51.060
<i>? Just won't wait?</i>

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.740
<i>? Ooh, baby
I love your way?</i>

01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:59.740
<i>? Every day?</i>

01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:02.110
<i>? Wanna tell you
I love your way?</i>

01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:06.040
<i>? I wanna tell you
I love your way?</i>

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:08.820
<i>? Wanna be with you
Night and day?</i>

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:13.650
<i>? Every day and every way?</i>

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:16.120
- You go, girl!
- Yeah.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.960
Woo! Woo-hoo!

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:20.360
Go, go!

01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:24.300
Yes! Yes! You're my hero.

01:14:25.770 --> 01:14:27.700
- We gotta go.
- You should give me

01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:29.030
lessons in kicking ass.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.060
Give me a hug.

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:31.240
- Oh, my God.
- You did it.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.070
- I did.
- Yeah, give me a hug, girlfriend.

01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:35.880
As great of a moment as that is,
we ain't got the time.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:37.340
- Yeah.
- They coming.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:38.980
The motorcycle freaks
is coming.

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.150
Seaplane!
We got to fly, man.

01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:43.740
Nope. I can't do it.

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.110
Okay? I told you,
I'm not a good pilot.

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.790
Maybe we should take
the school bus.

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:51.160
We can't outrun no motorcycle
on no damn bus!

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.190
You picked the plane
and hot-air balloon.

01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:54.420
Maybe pick
the helicopter.

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:57.130
No, I can't do it. Okay?
I don't wanna die.

01:14:57.130 --> 01:15:00.260
I'm freaking out
a little bit.

01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:03.400
Fine. I'll do it.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.400
How hard can it be?
It's a helicopter.

01:15:05.410 --> 01:15:07.300
You... You press
a button, the...

01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:08.970
They gonna spin. Okay.

01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:11.410
Then after that, I got my...
The... The lever.

01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:13.210
That's how...
That's how you getting

01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:14.680
the forward-backward action.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:17.310
Once we in the air,
I'mma be all right.

01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:19.180
This, I just gotta get...

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.150
'Cause it ain't got
no step stool, so...

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:23.410
Let me see something.
I can probably just...

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:24.920
Get in, but be careful.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.920
- No, you're drunk.
- No way. Nuh-uh.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.190
Fridge, you're drunk.
Give me the keys.

01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:31.790
- I'm?
- Alex. Alex.

01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:33.120
If I can fight
those guys,

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.930
you can fly this helicopter.
I know you can.

01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:37.300
Come on.

01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:41.960
Alex.

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.340
This is where we need you.

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:47.770
Remember,
you're the missing piece.

01:15:50.210 --> 01:15:54.140
Seaplane McDonough
reporting for duty.

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:55.340
Let's go, people.

01:16:16.330 --> 01:16:17.760
Whoa!

01:16:17.770 --> 01:16:19.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:29.310
- What's wrong?
- Something's broken!

01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:30.380
- What?
- What do you mean?

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:33.340
Hang on!

01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:40.950
Oh, my God,
we're about to die!

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.250
We're about to die!

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:52.530
- Oh, my God!
- It won't go up!

01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:54.400
- What?
- What do you mean?

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.800
The collective is busted.

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.260
- What?
- It controls the plate up there,

01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:59.800
which tilts the rotors
and controls the pitch.

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.910
It's how we go up and down.

01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:10.980
You guys?

01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:13.710
- That can't be good.
- It's no way that's good news.

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.860
Albino rhinos!

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:28.320
They're indigenous
to Jumanji.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.430
They're huge,
white, scary, and stupid,

01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:32.200
- and they eat people.
- No.

01:17:35.010 --> 01:17:36.360
They're getting close!

01:17:36.370 --> 01:17:38.870
My stomach's starting
to bother me a bit.

01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:41.110
- Go up!
- I can't go up!

01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:42.970
I think I had
too many margaritas.

01:17:47.310 --> 01:17:49.820
You guys,
what are we gonna do?

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:51.150
I'll fix the helicopter.

01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:52.580
- Yes!
- Tell me what to do.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:54.850
You gotta connect
the flight-control rod

01:17:54.850 --> 01:17:56.290
to the mesh plate
under the rotors.

01:17:56.290 --> 01:17:59.020
Flight-control rod, mesh plate,
under the rotors.

01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:00.990
- Wait, what?
- I'll be right back.

01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:05.000
- Spencer, where are you going?
- Hurry up.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.520
- Be careful!
- No, no, just hurry up!

01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:09.190
All right, just
gonna stand on this thingy,

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:13.140
pull myself up towards these
deadly helicopter blades. Okay.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.440
There's the mesh plate.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.170
Here's that rod thingy.

01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:31.380
- Spencer!
- Speed it up, Alex!

01:18:41.230 --> 01:18:42.860
Spencer!

01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:48.800
Hurry! Come on, fix it!

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:56.870
- Oh, my God!
- Running out of time!

01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:58.810
- Fix it, please!
- No, no, no.

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:01.280
Got it!

01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:11.620
We made it! You did it!
I thought we were gonna die.

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:12.920
- Oh.
- Yes!

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.460
- Nice!
- Thank you.

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:17.280
- Thank you, guys.
- You did it. That was scary.

01:19:17.290 --> 01:19:18.620
Oops.

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.230
What?

01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:23.060
I dropped the jewel.

01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:24.490
What?

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:25.560
You dropped the jewel?

01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:27.030
I leaned over,

01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:28.670
thought I had to puke,
and I didn't.

01:19:28.670 --> 01:19:30.100
It came out
of my backpack.

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:32.230
- We need the freaking jewel!
- I know.

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:35.240
That's-that's-that's the crazy
part 'cause I know we need it.

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:37.210
So we're in a pickle.
We're in a pickle.

01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:38.980
Turn around.
We gotta go get it.

01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:40.970
Yeah, let's loop around.
Look for it.

01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:42.140
Everybody open your eyes.

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:44.050
Let's all look for it
as a group.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.960
There! I see it!

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.230
What are they doing?

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:04.460
It's like they're
protecting it or something.

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:07.970
- How are we gonna do this?
- I don't know.

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:10.000
Well, you gotta go get it,
right, buddy?

01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:15.540
What do you need?
Your boomerang?

01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:17.310
Maybe some scissors?

01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:19.540
A pipe wrench?
Some shoelaces?

01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:22.550
I'm your valet. Whatever
you need, I can get it for you.

01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:25.220
Okay? You just say the word.

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.010
- What?
- I'm sorry, buddy.

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.010
Sorry for what?

01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:31.320
Ow!

01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:39.970
No.

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:54.380
Turn us around.

01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:55.920
No!

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:01.310
Heel! Heel! Stop!

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.180
Oh, my God!

01:21:03.190 --> 01:21:05.580
- No!
- Alex, get ready to roll us

01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:07.050
- to the side.
- What?

01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:11.400
SPENCER; When I tell you,
roll 90 degrees to the right.

01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:13.730
Now!

01:21:18.130 --> 01:21:21.100
You pushed me out
the helicopter, jackass!

01:21:23.730 --> 01:21:25.600
Oh, wow!

01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:28.340
- Spencer, you're amazing.
- Thank you.

01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:30.240
You are a killer pilot, Alex.

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:32.210
- Thanks.
- You too, Spencer,

01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:34.210
- you were incredible!
- Thank you...

01:21:34.210 --> 01:21:36.340
- Hey!
- ...but he was amazing, our pilot.

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:38.080
- Excuse me.
- You killed it.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.250
Excuse me.

01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:40.410
Excuse me!

01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:42.490
I'm the one that
was a human sacrifice.

01:21:42.490 --> 01:21:46.220
You don't know what's on
the underside of those rhinos.

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:48.150
And you don't wanna know.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:50.490
I've seen a lot of things.

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.460
Felt them on my face too.

01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:55.390
Things that I will never be able
to erase from memory.

01:21:56.770 --> 01:21:58.230
Oh, that's funny to you guys.

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.580
Go ahead, laugh it up.
Get it out.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.170
Guys, I've been trying
to get across

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:07.110
this canyon for, like,
20 years, okay?

01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:08.700
Do you realize
how huge this is?

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.750
Mosquito.

01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:17.410
No, no, no!
Alex, no, no, no!

01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:19.620
- Alex.
- Alex, no, no.

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:21.050
Alex?

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.320
Alex, talk to me.
Wake up. Here we go.

01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:25.120
Alex? He's dying.

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:27.120
No, we can't let him die.
We're too close!

01:22:27.130 --> 01:22:28.630
Does anyone
know how to do CPR?

01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:31.760
Yeah, start with three chest
compressions and mouth-to-mouth.

01:22:31.770 --> 01:22:33.690
One, two, three.

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:35.400
How do I do this?

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.240
Okay, pinch his nose,
open his mouth,

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:38.500
- full lip-lock.
- Okay.

01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:42.140
Ah, one breath, two breaths,
then repeat.

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:52.150
Come on, Alex.

01:22:54.690 --> 01:22:57.290
Bethany, stop. Your tattoo.

01:22:58.550 --> 01:23:01.360
It looks like you're giving him
one of your lives.

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.450
I'm okay with that.

01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:06.230
What if you need it
for yourself?

01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:08.430
I want Alex to come home too.

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.710
Oh!

01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:33.350
- What happened?
- Alex,

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.780
Bethany gave you
one of her lives.

01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:37.150
Bethany, you okay?

01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:38.350
I think so.

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:39.820
Bethany,
is that true?

01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:42.150
You gave me
one of your lives?

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:44.160
I mean, yeah, of course.

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.470
Thank you.

01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:57.170
What? What are
you looking at?

01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:58.470
You got a situation.

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:04.540
Oh, my God,
these things are crazy.

01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:21.390
Twenty years,
huh?

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.460
Yeah,
I guess so.

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.630
You know,

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:32.570
I just keep thinking about
my poor parents.

01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:34.540
And what they must've
been through.

01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:37.540
And why, because I was sitting
in my hideout,

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:39.380
too afraid
to finish the game?

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:44.740
I'm sorry.

01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:47.920
I don't mean to lay this on you.
I'm just...

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.850
You're really easy
to talk to.

01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:52.680
No, I get it.
I mean, sometimes

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:55.690
it's easy to get so focused
on your own stuff

01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:59.370
that you forget other people
have problems too.

01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:01.790
That's really deep.

01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:05.270
Thanks. I feel like
ever since I lost my phone,

01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:07.370
my other senses have
kind of heightened.

01:25:08.730 --> 01:25:12.270
Does "phone" mean something
different in the future?

01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:18.580
What about you, Alex?
What are you like?

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:21.520
In the real world.
What's your vibe?

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:24.310
Full-on
metalhead.

01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:27.290
A drummer, like my dad.

01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:43.430
Hey.

01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:46.960
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:49.400
I, uh, I was just
filling these up.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.610
- Cool.
- Yeah.

01:25:55.570 --> 01:25:57.510
I'm glad you're here.
I, uh, ahem...

01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:02.010
- I have something to tell you.
- Yeah?

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:03.650
And I wanna tell you now,

01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:04.980
just in case
the next time

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:09.360
that we talk
I'm no longer brave.

01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:13.290
I like you, Martha.

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:16.920
I, like, like you.

01:26:18.330 --> 01:26:21.030
Like,
I'm fully into you.

01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:23.870
- You are?
- I am.

01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:25.630
And I have been

01:26:25.630 --> 01:26:28.210
since, like,
the seventh grade.

01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:30.480
Really?

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:34.840
Wowza. I don't think
this has ever happened before.

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:37.610
- What do you mean?
- Oh, I mean, like, I don't think

01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:41.550
anyone's ever liked me that I...
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:43.650
I never tell anyone
how I fe...

01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:49.220
I'm into you too,
Spencer.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.560
- You are?
- Yes. Yes! Heh, heh!

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.490
God, you're smart
and sweet and cute.

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.630
Yeah, I'm pretty into you.

01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:06.400
Wait. Are you sure it's not
because of, like, all of...?

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:08.470
What? Oh, my God, no, no.

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:11.050
That is not my type.
I'm into nerds.

01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:13.410
Really?

01:27:13.410 --> 01:27:14.880
I'm a nerd.

01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:37.430
- That was... I was so awful.
- I've never kissed anyone.

01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:39.670
- You've never...?
- Never. That was the first time.

01:27:39.670 --> 01:27:41.100
- I have never.
- Oh, you haven't?

01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:42.470
- No.
- Okay. Cool.

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:44.840
You can't tell, right?

01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:49.680
Come on. Hey!

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.510
I don't wanna see that.
I don't, not today.

01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:54.580
While you're down here
professing your love

01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:57.420
for one another,
I found the Jaguar.

01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:01.020
Let's go. God! Ugh!

01:28:10.930 --> 01:28:13.560
- There it is.
- There it is.

01:28:13.570 --> 01:28:15.670
We'd better get walking.

01:28:37.530 --> 01:28:40.520
I think we just
follow this path.

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:43.900
No. It can't be that easy.

01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:47.830
"The Defenders."

01:28:49.130 --> 01:28:50.700
What does
that mean?

01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:53.700
There's only one way
to find out.

01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:57.800
Fridge,

01:28:57.810 --> 01:28:59.070
give me the jewel.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.910
Spencer.

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.530
Something's about to happen.

01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:23.560
I hate those drums.

01:29:23.570 --> 01:29:26.660
What, you're just gonna
walk in there?

01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:28.030
No.

01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:31.970
That's what the game wants us
to do. Follow the path.

01:29:33.170 --> 01:29:35.370
It's a trap.

01:29:40.770 --> 01:29:42.780
"When you see the elephant...

01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:46.390
begin the climb."

01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:53.090
I'll go through the trees.

01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:54.520
- The trees?
- Yeah.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.020
Do you think
that's what that means?

01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:57.120
That must be it.

01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.920
That's the move.

01:29:58.930 --> 01:30:01.800
This is the final level
of the game.

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:04.900
And I'm pretty sure
this is a Bravestone thing.

01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:12.170
Did he just refer to himself
in the third person?

01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:15.640
Um, fourth person, I think.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.110
How does he do that?

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:26.540
Climbing is one
of his strengths.

01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:28.710
Oh. Gotcha.

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.560
Cake makes me
explode.

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:55.840
- No! Spencer!
- Oh, my God!

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:58.110
Spencer!

01:30:58.110 --> 01:31:01.080
Spencer!

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.120
Oh, my God, you guys.
Panthers.

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:08.720
No.

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.490
Those are jaguars.

01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:37.780
Spencer!

01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:39.610
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

01:31:39.610 --> 01:31:41.750
Yeah. I think so.

01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:44.650
You still have the jewel,
right?

01:31:44.650 --> 01:31:46.150
- I got it.
- Oh, thank God.

01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:47.290
Hey, what happened?

01:31:47.290 --> 01:31:49.790
I don't wanna talk
about it.

01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:51.590
Okay, we need a new plan.

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:52.820
- Yeah.
- Right.

01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:55.060
- Totally.
- Spencer, any ideas?

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.670
Can I speak with you
for a minute?

01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:02.070
Now?

01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:06.510
What's going on?

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.770
I can't do this.

01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:12.080
- What are you talking about?
- I can't do this.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.240
Okay, who am I kidding?
I'm not some adventurer.

01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:17.780
I'm not actually brave.

01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:20.180
Spencer, I just saw you
hanging out of a helicopter.

01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:23.650
It's a lot easier to be brave
when you have lives to spare.

01:32:23.650 --> 01:32:24.990
It's a lot harder...

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.320
when you only have one life.

01:32:29.730 --> 01:32:33.220
We-we always only have
one life, man.

01:32:33.230 --> 01:32:37.170
Okay? That's... That's all
we get. That's how it works.

01:32:37.170 --> 01:32:40.860
The question is,
is how are you gonna live it?

01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:43.770
Which guy are
you gonna decide to be?

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:47.340
Did I just quote
our principal?

01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:50.940
What the hell is this game doing
to me? I gotta get out of here.

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.210
Look.

01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:54.620
We can do this, man.

01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:56.950
We can do it together.

01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:03.820
- Together.
- Together.

01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:07.830
You're a good friend,
Fridge.

01:33:11.190 --> 01:33:12.800
All right.

01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:16.100
Okay. I don't know
video games,

01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:18.360
but what I do know
is football.

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:21.300
Now, those lightning-fast,
man-eating cats out there?

01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:22.840
They're the Defenders.

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:25.240
Which means we gotta run
one hell of an offense.

01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:26.370
You guys.

01:33:29.210 --> 01:33:30.710
We gotta go.

01:33:30.710 --> 01:33:32.750
All right.
Here's what we're gonna do.

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:37.920
<i>We're gonna fan out
and run a play that I call:</i>

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:40.190
<i>"The Double Reverse
Refrigerator."</i>

01:33:40.190 --> 01:33:43.190
<i>Bethany,
you go up the left side.</i>

01:33:43.190 --> 01:33:44.860
<i>I'll go up the right.</i>

01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:46.760
<i>Alex, you'll draw
the defense,</i>

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:48.220
<i>so Spencer can go
up the middle.</i>

01:33:48.230 --> 01:33:50.130
- <i>I'll go with Spencer.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:52.130
<i>There's something else
we need you to do.</i>

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:57.000
<i>? Ooh, baby
I love your way?</i>

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000
<i>? Every day, yeah?</i>

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.440
<i>? Ooh, baby
I love your way?</i>

01:34:03.450 --> 01:34:05.070
You guys like to dance?

01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:12.020
<i>? Shadows grow so long
Before my eyes?</i>

01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:24.190
Hey! Over here!

01:34:24.190 --> 01:34:26.170
Come and get me!

01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:44.340
<i>? I wanna tell you, I wanna
Tell you, I wanna tell you?</i>

01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:52.950
No! No.

01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:05.800
- Thanks.
- Sure.

01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:10.070
Get to the statue. Go!

01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:31.780
Oh, no! I...

01:36:07.450 --> 01:36:11.020
Ah, whoa, whoa.

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:44.320
Oh, man. Okay.

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:46.390
Stay calm, don't panic.

01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:48.030
Stop!

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.360
It's the elephant
and the mouse.

01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.520
What's up?

01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:59.500
Mouse Finbar.

01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.600
Zoologist.

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.200
Zoologist and...

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:06.370
And backpack guy.

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:28.990
Give me the jewel,
or your friend dies.

01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:32.890
- Don't give it to him!
- Quiet!

01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:34.320
Stop!

01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:42.070
Take me instead,
okay?

01:37:50.650 --> 01:37:52.210
Give me the jewel.

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:54.610
I can't do that.

01:37:54.610 --> 01:37:56.450
Five.

01:37:56.450 --> 01:37:59.910
- Four, three...
- I can't give you the jewel.

01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:01.320
- Spencer.
- Two!

01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:03.350
Because I don't have it!

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.900
Zoology, bitch!

01:38:24.370 --> 01:38:26.310
No, no, no! Don't...

01:38:33.050 --> 01:38:35.750
Douche bag! You suck!

01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.990
- Elephant.
- "Begin the climb."

01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:47.090
Leave her alone!

01:38:47.090 --> 01:38:49.060
Get up there,
I'll get the jewel to you.

01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:50.300
- Martha.
- Trust me.

01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:52.270
- I'll get it to you. Go.
- Okay.

01:38:59.270 --> 01:39:01.100
Go, Martha!

01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:09.940
Alex!

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:11.970
I'll take that.

01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:26.740
Game over.

01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:38.260
I don't think so.

01:40:43.130 --> 01:40:44.460
Venom's my weakness.

01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:15.390
Go, Spencer.

01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:26.470
No.

01:41:38.410 --> 01:41:40.050
- Yeah! - Wow!
- Yeah.

01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:54.690
"Call out its name."

01:41:54.690 --> 01:41:55.830
Call out its name!

01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:57.560
Call out its name, everyone!

01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.160
Jumanji!

01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:02.630
Jumanji!

01:42:43.470 --> 01:42:45.530
- I think we did it.
- I think we won.

01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:47.430
I think we did.

01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:49.610
Guys,
it's Nigel.

01:42:49.610 --> 01:42:51.240
Nigel.

01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:01.750
Well done,
intrepid adventurers!

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:03.250
You lifted the curse!

01:43:03.250 --> 01:43:05.550
All of Jumanji thanks you.

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:06.860
Your work here is done.

01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:09.820
So, sadly,
this is where we part.

01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:11.690
Seaplane McDonough,

01:43:11.690 --> 01:43:13.400
let me shake your hand.

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:22.100
Alex.

01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:29.140
Adieu, Professor Oberon.

01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:36.520
Later, dude.

01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.520
I'll miss you the most,
my little Mouse.

01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.630
Get me the hell
out of here.

01:43:54.370 --> 01:43:56.400
Farewell, Ruby Roundhouse.

01:43:57.670 --> 01:43:59.270
Wait.

01:43:59.270 --> 01:44:01.240
What if we didn't go back?

01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:04.340
I just...

01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:09.250
I like being like this.
With you.

01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:13.510
Then let's be like this,

01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:15.380
every day.

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:19.190
Just come home.

01:44:36.230 --> 01:44:37.700
Dr. Bravestone.

01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:53.450
Nigel, I'm ready to go home.

01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:56.320
Farewell, my good man.

01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:03.400
See you later,
Bravestone.

01:45:33.450 --> 01:45:34.650
Oh, my God.

01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:37.950
Yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes!
I'm back, baby!

01:45:37.950 --> 01:45:40.690
I will never complain
about my body ever again.

01:45:40.690 --> 01:45:41.990
Oh, thank God.

01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:43.500
Oh, I missed you.

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:50.700
Where's Alex?

01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:15.360
Wait, look.

01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:20.360
Freak House?

01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:25.730
Do you think...?

01:46:25.730 --> 01:46:28.340
That means, maybe...

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:40.470
- Grandpa!
- Hey!

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:45.580
Come here. Come here.
Oh, that's my girl.

01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:48.880
- Hi!
- So good to see you.

01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:51.550
Come on. Come on
and say hi to Grandma.

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.660
- Alex?
- Hey, Dad, when you get a sec,

01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:56.090
- could you give us a hand?
- Yeah.

01:46:56.090 --> 01:46:58.620
Oh, that is some tree.

01:46:58.630 --> 01:47:01.600
- Yeah, it's not too bad.
- Yeah.

01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:07.830
Hey, Dad, will you
give me a second?

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:10.440
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- I'll be right back.

01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:25.720
Bethany?

01:47:28.150 --> 01:47:31.330
- Spencer?
- Yeah.

01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:33.090
Ruby Roundhouse?

01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:38.630
And that
would make you Fridge.

01:47:43.130 --> 01:47:45.170
I'm stoked to see you.

01:47:45.170 --> 01:47:46.710
All of you.

01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:50.470
- You made it back.
- Yeah, I did.

01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:53.480
It spit me out
right where I started, so...

01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:56.110
1996.

01:47:56.110 --> 01:47:59.080
And your parents
and your house?

01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:01.920
Yeah, they... All good, bro.

01:48:05.490 --> 01:48:07.750
You're an adult now.

01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:09.190
You have a family.

01:48:09.190 --> 01:48:11.130
I do, yeah.

01:48:11.130 --> 01:48:13.120
This is Andy.

01:48:13.130 --> 01:48:14.720
And then my daughter...

01:48:14.730 --> 01:48:17.970
My daughter's name
is Bethany.

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:22.930
We named her after the girl
who saved my life.

01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:31.980
So stoked. Heh.

01:48:51.930 --> 01:48:53.190
Yo.

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:54.660
Yo.

01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:59.230
You wanna
go backpacking?

01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:01.630
Like, in nature?

01:49:01.630 --> 01:49:04.500
Yeah, but, like, somewhere,
like, really amazing.

01:49:04.510 --> 01:49:07.100
Next summer?
What do you think?

01:49:07.110 --> 01:49:09.640
- Are you okay?
- Hey.

01:49:10.810 --> 01:49:12.740
Oh, um,
I'll catch you later.

01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:14.550
I'll see you after class?

01:49:15.550 --> 01:49:17.650
- Hey!
- Hello.

01:49:17.650 --> 01:49:19.750
- Hey.
- So, uh, anything...

01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:21.490
interesting
happen lately?

01:49:21.490 --> 01:49:23.520
No, I can't think
of anything.

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:24.850
Yeah. Heh.

01:49:24.850 --> 01:49:26.560
Have you guys talked
to Martha?

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:29.060
Oh, I was texting her
this weekend.

01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:31.530
Have you talked to her?

01:49:32.530 --> 01:49:34.530
Hey. There she is.

01:49:39.570 --> 01:49:42.710
Go get that girl,
Dr. Bravestone.

01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:51.650
Hi.

01:49:51.650 --> 01:49:53.810
- Hi.
- I really...

01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:55.710
- I really wanted to call you.
- I get it.

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.650
Sorry, I don't know
why I didn't call.

01:49:57.650 --> 01:49:58.990
It's weird being out and,

01:49:58.990 --> 01:50:01.980
not, like, knowing,
like, what's going on and...

01:50:05.790 --> 01:50:07.130
What?

01:50:20.570 --> 01:50:22.040
Smoldering.
