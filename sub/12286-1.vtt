        ouch!

        [sighs]                 

01:31.707 --> 01:33.141
        Pete.                   

01:34.643 --> 01:36.044
            Pete?               

01:36.112 --> 01:37.745
            Pete?               

01:39.781 --> 01:42.617
What exactly are you            
trying to catch?                

01:42.684 --> 01:44.652
                I'm not sure.   

01:44.720 --> 01:47.489
Can we leave my fingers         
out of it?                      

01:47.556 --> 01:50.525
        I'm sorry, mom, but     
        there must be a reason  

01:50.592 --> 01:52.127
Why we can never find           
anything in this house.         

01:52.194 --> 01:55.063
            There is. It's      
            called your father. 

01:55.131 --> 01:57.665
Mom, I'm serious.               

01:57.733 --> 01:59.167
What about the pen              
by the phone?                   

01:59.235 --> 02:00.935
And the Christmas               
tree lights, remember?          

02:01.003 --> 02:03.304
 And the needle and thread      
 you left on the bed?           

02:03.372 --> 02:07.242
Matches, batteries, candles,    
safety pins, dental floss?      

02:07.309 --> 02:09.176
                Ok, ok.         

02:09.245 --> 02:11.179
Something is taking             
our stuff,                      

02:11.247 --> 02:12.947
And I'm going to                
find out what it is.            

02:13.015 --> 02:15.383
        All right,              
    who stole my watch?         

02:15.451 --> 02:16.551
Victoria: It's by the radio.    

02:16.618 --> 02:17.818
        Where are you guys      
        going anyway?           

02:17.886 --> 02:20.221
Joe: We have a meeting with     
the great Ocious P. Potter.     

02:20.289 --> 02:21.656
He's reading                    
aunt Mary's will.               

02:21.723 --> 02:22.924
            What's so great     
            about him?          

02:22.991 --> 02:24.426
    Victoria: He's a lawyer.    

02:24.493 --> 02:26.061
    We have to see him          
    about the house.            

02:26.128 --> 02:27.362
                Something wrong?

02:27.430 --> 02:28.863
Probably wants us               
to sign some papers.            

02:28.931 --> 02:30.198
        Nothing                 
        to worry about.         

02:30.266 --> 02:33.000
Let's go, Pete. You're going    
to be late for school.          

02:33.069 --> 02:34.235
            Honey...            

02:34.303 --> 02:37.305
        Can't find              
        my stupid keys.         

02:37.373 --> 02:39.941
Oh, my gosh, Pete,              
I'm so sorry. You're right.     

02:40.008 --> 02:42.544
Some...Thing                    
must have taken them.           

02:42.611 --> 02:44.812
                See? I told you!

02:44.880 --> 02:47.182
[imitating scary music]         
oo-oo-oo-oo!                    

02:48.584 --> 02:50.118
            Joe:                
            Wait a second.      

02:50.186 --> 02:52.420
            Where's             
            my briefcase gone?  

02:52.488 --> 02:54.372
            What                
            a beautiful day!    

02:54.440 --> 02:56.674
Victoria: Come on, Pete,        
get a move on.                  

02:59.644 --> 03:01.079
        [car doors slam]

                        [sighs] 

03:45.424 --> 03:46.724
                    Ha ha!      

03:54.533 --> 03:56.567
                [straining]     

04:06.345 --> 04:07.345
                    [blows]     

04:07.413 --> 04:09.180
                Still got       
                plenty of time. 

04:27.599 --> 04:28.766
    Here we go.                 

04:34.973 --> 04:37.108
            [grunts]            

04:43.949 --> 04:46.033
No will?                        
                        No will?

04:47.203 --> 04:49.537
    Horrible, isn't it?         

04:50.673 --> 04:52.540
    I've been through           
    your late aunt's files      

04:52.608 --> 04:54.175
    With a fine legal comb,     

04:54.243 --> 04:57.545
        And believe me,         
    it just doesn't exist.      

04:57.613 --> 04:59.747
            That's impossible.  

04:59.815 --> 05:01.249
    We were right in this office

05:01.317 --> 05:03.017
    When she said she was       
    leaving the house to us.    

05:03.085 --> 05:04.919
    Come on! You were sitting   
        right there!            

05:04.986 --> 05:07.288
        Sometimes people say    
        one thing and then...   

05:07.356 --> 05:10.958
    Turn around and do something
    completely different.       

05:11.026 --> 05:12.727
    Or in your aunt's case, they
    turn around and drop dead.

                [click]         

05:16.699 --> 05:18.533
Joe: I don't                    
believe this.                   

05:20.302 --> 05:21.569
We've got to be able to work    
something out here.             

05:21.637 --> 05:22.604
            I already have.     

05:24.506 --> 05:27.775
The world is a train speeding   
towards the 21st century,       

05:27.843 --> 05:30.278
And I'll be damned              
if our little town              

05:30.346 --> 05:32.179
Is going to be left             
standing at the station.        

05:32.248 --> 05:33.715
    Ta-dah!

luxury apartments               

05:38.654 --> 05:41.188
In the place of one house.      

05:41.257 --> 05:44.392
            You're demolishing  
            our house for that? 

05:44.460 --> 05:46.394
You like it? You have until     
Saturday to move out.           

05:46.462 --> 05:48.062
                Wh--Saturday?   

05:48.130 --> 05:51.266
There must be                   
something we can do.            

05:51.333 --> 05:53.601
    Where there's no will...    

05:53.669 --> 05:55.670
        There's no way.         

05:55.738 --> 05:57.605
            [mixer whirring]    

06:13.656 --> 06:16.491
        Stop right there,       
        Arrietty clock.         

06:16.558 --> 06:19.494
        What is the first rule  
        of borrowing?           

06:19.561 --> 06:22.764
The first rule of borrowing--   
that's a tricky one.            

06:22.831 --> 06:26.668
Is it...Have as much fun        
as you can?                     

06:26.735 --> 06:29.003
                Arrietty?       

06:29.070 --> 06:31.138
        The first rule          
        of borrowing:           

06:31.206 --> 06:33.641
        A borrower must         
        never, ever be seen.    

06:33.709 --> 06:35.376
        You've only told me     
        a zillion times, dad.   

06:35.444 --> 06:38.946
Well, what is the first         
thing you do, then?             

06:39.014 --> 06:40.782
        Check that the coast    
        is clear.               

06:40.849 --> 06:42.583
        I did, and it's clear,  
        so can we go now?       

06:42.651 --> 06:45.486
    Hold on.                    

06:45.554 --> 06:49.223
    Come on, Peagreen. We have  
    a very big day ahead of us. 

06:49.291 --> 06:51.326
Oh, I hate big days.            

06:51.393 --> 06:53.461
    Come on, Peagreen.          

06:53.529 --> 06:54.946
            You hate everything.

06:55.013 --> 06:57.281
    That's not true.            
    I like sweets.              

06:57.348 --> 06:59.383
    Candy...                    

06:59.451 --> 07:01.686
                Sweets, candy,  
                ga-ga.          

07:01.753 --> 07:04.388
        Chocolate,              
        ice cream, chips.       

07:04.456 --> 07:05.890
                    Oh, shut up.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.592
            Doughnuts           
            with jam.           

07:07.659 --> 07:09.426
                    Arrietty,   
                    come back!  

07:09.494 --> 07:11.128
        We've got a lot         
        of borrowing to do,     

07:11.196 --> 07:12.697
        And I've got to change  
        this battery.           

07:31.049 --> 07:34.252
            Today,              
    Potter's apartments...      

07:34.319 --> 07:35.819
        Tomorrow...             

07:35.887 --> 07:37.855

08:01.463 --> 08:03.598
Where do you think              
you're going?                   

08:03.665 --> 08:05.065
Dad told us                     
not to budge.                   

08:05.133 --> 08:06.401
        Stop it,                
        you little squirt.      

08:06.468 --> 08:07.635
        Are you going           
        to help me or not?      

08:07.703 --> 08:08.703
Not.                            

08:08.771 --> 08:10.938
    Fine. I'll eat all          
    the ice cream myself then.  

08:12.274 --> 08:13.824
Wait for me, Arrietty!          
Don't climb so fast!            

08:13.892 --> 08:16.093
            Peagreen: Don't     
            leave me behind!    

08:18.397 --> 08:19.797
        [groaning]              

08:30.108 --> 08:32.443
        I'm getting             
        too old for this.       

08:38.417 --> 08:40.751
If dad catches you,             
Arrietty,                       

08:40.818 --> 08:43.020
I have nothing                  
to do with this.                

08:43.087 --> 08:44.689
This is a big mistake.          

08:46.942 --> 08:49.410
        Right, ok, here we go.  

08:52.414 --> 08:53.347
Arrietty!                       

08:53.415 --> 08:54.816
                        What?   

08:54.883 --> 08:57.434
I'm going to need a lot         
of ice cream, Arrietty.         

08:57.502 --> 08:59.720
        Stupid little squirt.   

09:02.458 --> 09:04.858
                Look...         

09:04.926 --> 09:06.760
            A whole room        
            full of winter.     

09:27.516 --> 09:29.316
Arrietty,                       
what are you doing?             

09:29.384 --> 09:31.318
            [chewing] nothing.  

09:31.386 --> 09:33.437
What about                      
the ice cream?                  

09:33.504 --> 09:35.505
        I'm sure it must be     
        around here somewhere.  

09:37.542 --> 09:40.444
Unh! Arrietty! Aah!             

09:42.080 --> 09:45.148
I can't hold it!                
I can't hold it, Arrietty!      

09:45.216 --> 09:46.984
    Help!                       

09:49.438 --> 09:50.304
                Dad!            

10:07.489 --> 10:08.589
            Peagreen: Dad!      

10:08.657 --> 10:10.391
            My arm's stuck!     

10:26.842 --> 10:29.176
        Dad!                    

10:29.244 --> 10:31.111
        Dad!                    

10:31.179 --> 10:32.547
        Dad!                    

10:32.614 --> 10:34.381
                 What is it?    

10:34.449 --> 10:36.918
                What's going on?
                What's happened?

10:36.985 --> 10:40.021
            She made me do it!  
            It's not my fault!  

10:40.088 --> 10:42.089
    Where is she?               

10:42.157 --> 10:43.457
                In there.       

10:43.525 --> 10:45.660
She's in the freezer?           

10:45.727 --> 10:48.162
                Is that bad?    

10:48.229 --> 10:50.865
I don't think it                
could get much worse.           

10:50.933 --> 10:52.800
                [door opens]    

10:54.036 --> 10:55.603
It just got worse.              

10:56.772 --> 10:58.338
            Hold tight.         
            Here we go.         

10:58.406 --> 11:00.507
Dad! Dad!                       
Don't do it!                    

11:00.576 --> 11:01.909
            We've got to do it! 

11:01.977 --> 11:03.410
    We did it!                  

11:03.478 --> 11:04.712
    We did it!                  

11:04.780 --> 11:07.481
    Take the battery and        
    get back to your mother.    

11:07.549 --> 11:09.483
    Tell her not to worry,      
        all right?              

11:12.220 --> 11:14.088
        [shivering]             

11:28.904 --> 11:30.270
            Oof!                

11:43.485 --> 11:44.752
            You want some ice   
            in here?            

11:44.820 --> 11:45.987
No, thanks.                     

11:49.658 --> 11:55.646
            Aah!                

11:55.714 --> 11:58.181
            Aah!                

11:59.484 --> 12:00.450
                    All right?  

12:00.519 --> 12:02.419
I'm in big trouble,             
right?                          

12:05.824 --> 12:06.924
    Quiet.

    Whoa!                       

13:24.803 --> 13:27.204
    Come on, Arrietty.          
    Stop dawdling.              

13:27.271 --> 13:29.339
    Your mother's going to be   
    cross enough as it is.      

13:29.407 --> 13:30.507
            I told him          
            you weren't ready.  

13:30.575 --> 13:31.775
            Now look            
            what's happened!

                 He did it.     
                 He did it.     

13:33.912 --> 13:35.879
                He jumped right 
                off the fridge. 

13:35.947 --> 13:38.716
Peagreen, put that marshmallow  
down and drink your milk.       

13:38.783 --> 13:40.217
            But I hate milk.    

13:40.284 --> 13:42.185
See! [muttering]                

13:42.253 --> 13:46.056
Ah, there you are at last!      

13:46.124 --> 13:48.158
I was all in a spin!            

13:48.226 --> 13:50.160
Carpet, off.                    

13:50.228 --> 13:52.930
I was sick with worry!          
And where are the borrowings?   

13:52.998 --> 13:55.933
Oh, dear, how could you         
do this to me?                  

13:56.001 --> 13:57.400
        How could I?            

13:57.468 --> 14:00.904
Arrietty's the one who got      
herself stuck in the freezer.   

14:00.972 --> 14:02.906
What was I                      
supposed to do,                 

14:02.974 --> 14:04.942
Leave her there                 
until she iced over?            

14:05.010 --> 14:09.713
I had to run 'round             
the whole kitchen.              

14:09.781 --> 14:11.849
 I burned my toes               
 on the stove.                  

14:11.916 --> 14:13.784
    I told you they were        
    too young to go borrowing.  

14:13.852 --> 14:15.285
Yes, Arrietty.                  

14:15.353 --> 14:17.921
Me and dad have had it up       
to here with your behavior.     

14:17.989 --> 14:19.589
                Shut up, squirt.
    Ugly.

Double smelly.                  

14:21.359 --> 14:22.760
        Stop it, you two!

14:23.928 --> 14:25.763
Homily: Ah, that's better.      

14:25.830 --> 14:28.032
You know who she                
takes after, of course.         

14:28.099 --> 14:29.499
                Me.             
Mm-hmm.                         

14:29.567 --> 14:31.301
    If I took after him,        
    I'd never do anything fun.  

14:31.369 --> 14:33.570
            Don't be too sure.  

14:33.638 --> 14:36.140
        He was quite a rogue in 
        his time, your father.  

14:36.207 --> 14:38.408
                    Dad?        

14:38.476 --> 14:40.243
                    My dad?     

14:40.311 --> 14:41.545
                    I don't     
                    believe it. 

14:41.612 --> 14:42.546
I believe it!                   

14:42.613 --> 14:44.481
    I think your mother's right,
        Arrietty.               

14:44.549 --> 14:46.483
    We're going to have to keep 
    you at home for a while.    

14:46.551 --> 14:49.053
                What? But       
                that's not fair!

14:49.120 --> 14:50.721
    At least until              
    that nasty young bean       

14:50.789 --> 14:52.189
    Stops setting traps         
    everywhere.                 

14:52.256 --> 14:54.958
You put us in                   
great danger, Arrietty.

Never seen and never heard.

        the borrower way that."

        all my life,            

15:12.911 --> 15:15.278
        And I've never even     
        seen another borrower.

    Me, neither.                

15:16.347 --> 15:19.349
Well, you wouldn't,             
would you?

is it?

    Oh, my goodness, they must  
    have changed the schedule.

He and his friends would        
never stay put for a minute.

I wish you could have seen      
this house then, Etts.          

17:16.852 --> 17:19.854
It was full to the rafters.

The rafters, obviously.         

17:26.228 --> 17:29.496

    It's just us.

happening, Jim?                 

19:19.240 --> 19:21.775
            Max, are you on     
            that phone again?

of your mother.                 

19:30.618 --> 19:31.685
                Get back, I say!

21:22.597 --> 21:25.365
This is incredible.             
You can talk.                   

21:25.433 --> 21:28.235
Get what over with?

            The squishing.      

21:29.804 --> 21:31.671
            You are going       
            to squish me,       

21:31.740 --> 21:33.240
            So get on with it.  

21:33.307 --> 21:35.876
Why would you want me           
to do that?                     

21:35.944 --> 21:38.045
            I don't want you    
            to do it.           

21:38.113 --> 21:39.813
            It's just what      
            beans do.           

21:39.881 --> 21:41.548
What's a bean?                  

21:41.616 --> 21:44.084
            You are.            
            A human bean?       

21:44.152 --> 21:45.685
I think you mean...             

21:45.754 --> 21:48.321
Never mind. Look, I'm not       
going to squish you.            

21:48.389 --> 21:49.589
                You're not?     

21:49.657 --> 21:53.026
No, of course not.              
This is amazing.                

21:53.094 --> 21:55.395
I knew something strange        
was going on in our house,      

21:55.463 --> 21:58.632
But I never, ever imagined      
our stuff was being stolen--    

21:58.699 --> 22:01.668
        Stolen? No. We don't    
        steal, we borrow.       

22:01.736 --> 22:03.570
        We're Borrowers,        
        and you're our bean.    

22:03.638 --> 22:06.874
        Beans provide you       
        with things to borrow.  

22:06.941 --> 22:08.275
        But they'll squish you  
        as soon as look at you. 

22:08.342 --> 22:09.643
Who told you that?              

22:09.710 --> 22:10.644
                    My dad.     

22:10.711 --> 22:11.678
There are more of you?          

22:11.746 --> 22:14.347
        Just my dad, my mum,    
        and my little brother.  

22:14.415 --> 22:18.018
    There used to be more of us,
    but they've gone away.      

22:18.086 --> 22:20.921
        We're the last          
        of the Borrowers.       

22:20.989 --> 22:24.557
We have to move. The house      
is being demolished.            

22:24.625 --> 22:27.294
                Demolished?     

22:27.361 --> 22:29.729
Yeah. My great aunt             
left us the house,              

22:29.798 --> 22:32.266
But she didn't write it         
down in a will,                 

22:32.333 --> 22:35.735
So now this stupid man          
Potter's gonna tear it down.    

22:35.804 --> 22:37.204
So we have to move.             

22:37.272 --> 22:38.471
            But what about us?  

22:38.539 --> 22:39.840
You, too, I guess.              

22:39.908 --> 22:42.709
            This is terrible.   
            This is...          

22:42.777 --> 22:44.945
            Terrible!           

22:45.013 --> 22:47.281
Maybe there's some way          
I can help.                     

22:49.350 --> 22:54.003
    No, no, no, and again, no.  

22:54.072 --> 22:56.806
        I will not put          
    the fate of my family

                just listen--   

23:13.757 --> 23:16.859

        let you know

        every step of the way.

    We...Going, bean?           

23:54.449 --> 23:55.515
                Not far.        

23:55.583 --> 23:57.718
        The new house is just on
        the other side of town, 

23:57.785 --> 23:58.752

23:58.819 --> 24:00.721
            I think it's        
            about a mile.

        to my family,

        personally responsible!

        Yes, sir.

        I fixed it for you.     

24:25.813 --> 24:28.214
        I knew it wasn't mice.

26:30.271 --> 26:32.238
        Peagreen!               

26:32.306 --> 26:34.608
                Ughh.           

26:35.877 --> 26:37.844
                Ugghh.          

26:37.912 --> 26:40.313
                    Ohh, that's 
                    my appendix!

26:40.381 --> 26:41.415
Quit messing around.            

26:41.482 --> 26:43.950
        Dad, I've got to get out
        before they explode!    

26:44.018 --> 26:45.419
Peagreen, look out!             

26:45.486 --> 26:46.953
            Huh?                

26:47.021 --> 26:48.121
            Aah!                

26:48.189 --> 26:49.589
Peagreen!

27:13.464 --> 27:15.532
        Oh, ha ha ha.           

27:15.599 --> 27:17.434
                    [giggles]   

27:17.501 --> 27:20.169
        Pete:                   
        Dad, you gotta stop!    

27:20.237 --> 27:23.039
        Uh, I can't see.        
        Everything's gone dark. 

27:23.106 --> 27:25.709
        Um, my leg, ohh!        

27:25.776 --> 27:27.377
        I think it just broke.  

27:27.445 --> 27:29.612
Pete, I'm trying                
to concentrate.                 

27:29.680 --> 27:30.947
    There goes the other one.   
    Please, stop!               

27:31.014 --> 27:34.734
    Walkie-talkie: Oh, it hurts.
    Dad, you gotta stop!        

27:35.936 --> 27:37.637
We're going to find them.       

27:37.705 --> 27:40.307
Try not to worry.               

27:40.374 --> 27:42.442
        Try the talkie-talkie   
        again.                  

27:42.510 --> 27:45.245
I tried it 5 times!             

27:45.313 --> 27:48.047
        They don't know anything
        about the outside world!

27:48.116 --> 27:49.549
        Why did you ever agree  

27:49.617 --> 27:51.618
        To this ridiculous idea 
        in the first place?     

27:51.685 --> 27:54.554
Me? I was agreeing with you.    
I thought it was you--          

27:54.622 --> 27:56.356
        This is no time         
        to point fingers!       

27:56.424 --> 27:57.690
        Think of the children!  

27:57.758 --> 28:01.361
They're pretty smart.           
They're going to be all right.  

28:02.497 --> 28:05.932
But if anything                 
does happen to them,            

28:06.000 --> 28:08.368
There's going                   
to be big trouble.              

28:48.759 --> 28:49.926
        Here it is...           

28:49.994 --> 28:51.161
    The map of the world.       

28:51.228 --> 28:52.796
I'm tired, Arrietty.            

28:52.863 --> 28:54.664
I hate the world.               

28:54.731 --> 28:57.466
I'm staying here.               

28:57.534 --> 28:59.769
        We can't, silly.        

28:59.837 --> 29:01.370
        Now, let's see.         

29:01.438 --> 29:03.606
        This is us...           

29:03.674 --> 29:09.012
    And Pete said the new house 
    was next to a church.       

29:09.079 --> 29:10.246
    Look, it's not far at all.

on about now?

    Potter here. It's 12:30 now.

31:48.122 --> 31:50.690
    I'll be at city hall by 1:00
    to register the demolition.

        I want you here

            No. I gotta check   
            my stuff!

I'm feeling                     
a lot better now. Thanks.

I'll find them.                 

33:05.432 --> 33:07.433
            No! We'll find them!

33:07.501 --> 33:10.036
            From now on, I'm    
            calling the shots!  

33:10.104 --> 33:11.470
                Got it?         

33:41.769 --> 33:43.470
        Arrietty: [whispering]  
        we have to go faster!   

33:43.537 --> 33:45.071
Peagreen: I'm moving            
as fast as I can!               

33:50.243 --> 33:51.778
        Come on, Peagreen.      
        Lift it a little higher.

33:51.846 --> 33:53.312
        I'm doing all the work! 

33:53.380 --> 33:56.415
That's not true!                
This end's much heavier!        

34:08.261 --> 34:09.496
            Come on, Peagreen.  
            This way.           

34:16.737 --> 34:18.170
Do you think he saw us?         

34:18.237 --> 34:19.472
            I'm sure he didn't. 

34:19.540 --> 34:20.806
That's the biggest bean         
I've ever seen.                 

34:23.110 --> 34:24.777
Where to, Mr. Clock?            

34:24.844 --> 34:27.179
    Back to the old house       
        and pronto!             

34:27.246 --> 34:28.179
    Right.                      

34:30.851 --> 34:31.851
                        Pete?   

34:33.654 --> 34:35.121
    Where are you going?        

34:35.188 --> 34:36.572
                Nowhere, mom.   

34:36.639 --> 34:38.574
Watch out                       
for the cars.                   

34:38.641 --> 34:40.042
                I will.         
                Don't worry.    

34:44.014 --> 34:46.666
Come on, squirt,                
we've got to hurry.             

34:46.734 --> 34:48.167
            What for, idiot?    

34:48.235 --> 34:50.703
    We'll never get out of here 
    without him seeing us.      

34:50.771 --> 34:52.972
We'll get out while the bean    
is on his lunch hour.           

34:53.040 --> 34:54.940
Always the safest time          
with beans.                     

34:55.009 --> 34:57.510
    I still think we should     
    wait here for mum and dad.  

34:57.578 --> 35:01.014
Peagreen, try to understand.    
There won't be a here           

35:01.081 --> 35:04.717
Unless we get this will to Pete 
before that nasty, cheating,    

35:04.785 --> 35:08.087
Thieving, evil, greedy,         

35:08.155 --> 35:10.723
Vicious, ugly bean              
destroys our house.             

35:10.791 --> 35:13.192
            Ugly? Who are they  
            calling ugly?

                Arrietty,       
                we've been seen!

35:30.611 --> 35:31.744
Come on, this way!              

35:32.980 --> 35:34.413

36:03.343 --> 36:05.478
            Ow! Ow!             

36:05.545 --> 36:07.113
             Ohh...             

36:07.180 --> 36:08.514
            Potter: Oh!         

36:12.069 --> 36:15.271
            Hurry, Arrietty!    
            Hurry! Hurry!       

36:16.907 --> 36:18.374
            Ow!                 

36:30.754 --> 36:33.289
    This place is infested.     

36:39.129 --> 36:41.563
Did I ever tell you             

36:41.631 --> 36:44.066
About the time                  
my old friend Minty             

36:44.134 --> 36:45.834
Got stuck                       
in the honey pot?               

36:45.903 --> 36:48.104
                Yes, you did.   

36:59.833 --> 37:02.568
    [machine bubbling]          

37:05.839 --> 37:07.673
        Nice place.             

37:07.741 --> 37:09.675
        Me and Shelly           
    have just moved into        

37:09.743 --> 37:10.910
    A nice little house         
        near the--              

37:13.280 --> 37:14.480
        Borrowers.              

37:16.383 --> 37:17.683
                    You've seen 
                    this before?

37:17.751 --> 37:18.817
            No.                 

37:18.885 --> 37:21.454
    But I heard the stories.    

37:21.522 --> 37:23.856
    That's what I thought       
    they were, just stories.    

37:23.924 --> 37:25.858
        The fly                 
    with the human head,        

37:25.926 --> 37:27.793

37:27.861 --> 37:29.662
        The giant               
    radioactive cockroaches.    

37:29.729 --> 37:32.698
Spare me the folklore.          
Can you kill them or not?       

37:32.766 --> 37:33.699
                Yes.            

37:33.767 --> 37:37.570
            Extermination       
            is my middle name.  

37:37.637 --> 37:40.306
    But why do you want me to   
    exterminate the Borrowers?  

37:40.374 --> 37:43.142
'cause those little rats        
stole something very important, 

37:43.210 --> 37:46.745
And nobody steals               
from Ocious P. Potter!          

37:46.813 --> 37:48.614
            You mean "borrowed,"
            don't you?          

37:48.682 --> 37:49.648
    What?                       

37:49.716 --> 37:52.134
        They're Borrowers.      
        They don't steal, they--

37:54.638 --> 37:55.571
            Right.

38:08.435 --> 38:10.636
        We fell                 
        inches and inches,      

38:10.704 --> 38:12.138
        And now look at me.     

38:12.206 --> 38:14.107
        I'm covered in poo.     

38:15.675 --> 38:17.610
            Where are we going? 

38:17.677 --> 38:19.779
As far away from                
that big horrible bean          

38:19.847 --> 38:21.280
As we possibly can.             

38:23.350 --> 38:24.683
Do you hear something?          

38:26.586 --> 38:27.519
                        No.

38:46.874 --> 38:49.041

            It's gaining on us!

going to take?

    Wow!                        

45:57.787 --> 46:00.856
    I never knew there was      
    so much world in the world. 

46:00.924 --> 46:02.925
        Somehow we've got       
        to get to the new house.

Oh, it's too far.               

46:04.961 --> 46:06.461
Can't we stay here?             

46:06.530 --> 46:10.499
        If we stay here, we'll  
        get squished for sure.  

46:10.567 --> 46:14.036
And if we                       
go out there?

46:17.874 --> 46:20.609
Squished...                     
Might get squished.             

46:22.478 --> 46:23.646
Not much of a choice,           
is it?                          

46:23.713 --> 46:26.532
        Look, these wires go    
        all the way into town.  

46:28.168 --> 46:29.100
    So?                         

46:29.169 --> 46:31.537
            We'll get there     
            in no time.

            It's great,

    No. No. You look fine,

I'm a freak!

        Besides, it's what's on 
        the inside that counts. 

47:00.833 --> 47:02.100
You find those Borrowers,       

47:02.168 --> 47:05.437
Or I'll make sure you never     
kill in this town again!

        I believe it's time     
        to introduce you

What do you feed                
that animal?                    

47:34.084 --> 47:35.100
            I feed him

        Good God, man!          
    What happened to your face? 

47:54.320 --> 47:56.221
Is there something I can        
help you with, officer?

        of the peace

    Has been reported.

    That could be you,          
    couldn't it, sir?

    outside this house.

Well, it's my house,            
and I'll do what I want.        

48:26.586 --> 48:29.120
        Is it, sir?             

48:31.157 --> 48:33.392
I thought it belonged           
to the lenders.

that holds society together.

some cream on that.

        For a moment,           
        I thought...            

49:39.459 --> 49:42.761
    I can hardly bear to think  
    of what I thought.

    gone insane with fury.

that effect on people.

        You might just

                What are you    
                crying about?   

52:43.025 --> 52:44.092
    Who said that?              

52:51.267 --> 52:52.867
You're a borrower.              

52:52.935 --> 52:54.770
        Well, I was             
        the last time I looked. 

52:54.837 --> 52:58.774
    I didn't think there were   
    any more of us left.        

52:58.841 --> 53:00.442
Yeah? Well, here I am.

            I'm Arrietty clock. 

53:07.149 --> 53:09.217
Oh! You're an innie.            

53:09.285 --> 53:10.552
        That explains it all.   

53:10.620 --> 53:11.553
An innie?                       

53:11.621 --> 53:13.021
        You know,               
        a house borrower.       

53:13.088 --> 53:14.889
        Someone who depends     
        on beans for a living.  

53:14.957 --> 53:16.191
I don't depend on anyone,       
thank you.                      

53:16.258 --> 53:18.293
Now, if you'll excuse me,       
I have to find my brother.      

53:18.361 --> 53:20.729
            They've taken him   
            to the dairy.       

53:22.965 --> 53:24.232
    Come with me.               

53:29.205 --> 53:30.939
        Mr. Milkman!            

53:31.006 --> 53:32.307

         Mr. Milkman!           

53:35.378 --> 53:38.046
                Potter:         
                Stop! Please!   

53:38.113 --> 53:40.549
            Mr. Potter?         

53:46.088 --> 53:47.723
        Here we are.            

53:52.562 --> 53:54.996
    It was a water pipe         
    in the olden days.          

53:55.064 --> 53:57.366
    Now it's                    
    the spiller expressway.     

53:59.301 --> 54:02.337
    And this is                 
    the spiller express.        

54:03.573 --> 54:05.407
        You actually ride around
        in this thing?          

54:05.475 --> 54:06.875
    Sure.                       

54:08.511 --> 54:10.945
        Wow. You're a lot braver
        than you look.          

54:11.013 --> 54:12.180
Don't be scared, innie.         

54:12.248 --> 54:14.516
It's just a roller skate        
with a can of paint on top.     

54:14.584 --> 54:15.684
It's perfectly safe.            

54:15.752 --> 54:17.285
            I'm not scared.     

54:17.353 --> 54:20.221
        And I do wish you'd     
        stop calling me that.   

54:20.289 --> 54:21.356
                Why?            

54:21.424 --> 54:22.891
            It's what you are.  

54:22.958 --> 54:25.059

            live in houses.     

54:25.127 --> 54:26.528
            So you're an innie. 

54:26.596 --> 54:28.963
So, if I'm an innie,            
what does that make you, then?  

54:29.031 --> 54:29.964
An outie?                       

54:30.032 --> 54:32.300
        That's me.

        I've never seen anywhere
        like this.              

56:14.453 --> 56:16.087
            It's an automated
