you will take the ship down

I'm used to your brother's...

03:01.310 --> 03:05.349
It is "focus." If what S.H.I.E.L.D. has
found in Antarctica is what we think...

03:05.350 --> 03:07.601
We might be able to knock

you're on board with this.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.519
I'm not on board.

03:24.520 --> 03:28.229
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. business,
Cap. Avengers business.

03:28.230 --> 03:31.519
Last time I checked, we weren't
good enough for King Panther.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.769
It is also Wakandan business,
Hawkeye.

03:33.770 --> 03:35.559

from coming here.

am very glad to have you both.

nice to see you again.

Dr. Frost. I'm glad to see you're
putting your time here to good use.

the famous Black Panther.

How far down is this facility?

04:10.520 --> 04:12.599

found down here must be old.

Ugh. I do hate this thing.

It's not like there's anywhere for
me to go if I did try to escape.

04:20.769 --> 04:23.689
S.H.I.E.L.D. has given control
of this base to a criminal?

04:23.690 --> 04:25.849
Whitney's on the side
of the angels now.

04:25.850 --> 04:29.349
That's why I convinced S.H.I.E.L.D. to
let her head up this remote project.

04:29.350 --> 04:32.769
People can change, Panther.
You did.

04:32.770 --> 04:34.053
Well, first of all,

04:34.078 --> 04:37.059
I think we're describing me
as an ex-criminal these days.

04:37.060 --> 04:40.810
And this isn't Station Zebra, Your
Majesty. This is just the front door.

04:46.770 --> 04:48.809
You study climate change here?

04:48.810 --> 04:53.269
Yes. We pull ice from thousands of years
ago to test its chemical composition.

04:53.270 --> 04:56.309
Whitney is a genius.
I told the S.H.I.E.L.D. brass

04:56.310 --> 04:58.439
it was a waste
to keep her in a cell.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.439
So, you're out here alone?

05:00.440 --> 05:04.139
Just me and the robots.
For another six months.

05:04.140 --> 05:05.599
And then?

05:05.600 --> 05:08.689
And then you'll have paid
your debt to society,

05:08.690 --> 05:10.809
and you're gonna stick
with S.H.I.E.L.D.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.349
Change the world
or break it, right?

05:13.350 --> 05:15.729
Hmm.

05:15.730 --> 05:18.139
We are here now because
you believe your excavations

05:18.140 --> 05:20.769
have turned up a piece
of old Wakandan technology.

05:20.770 --> 05:22.310
Yes, King T'Challa.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.979
You could say that.

05:24.980 --> 05:27.270
Lights, please.

05:34.372 --> 05:35.850
Yemandi's cutter!

05:38.230 --> 05:41.019
No. Pretty sure
that's a ship.

05:41.020 --> 05:44.639
[BLACK PANTHER] It is a Wakandan ship.
Yemandi's cutter.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.899
It was lost centuries ago.

05:46.900 --> 05:49.559
And Whitney found it for you.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.309
Where I come from, we say
"thanks" for something like that.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.939
You have my thanks indeed,
Dr. Frost.

05:54.940 --> 05:57.639
My grandfather searched
for this ship for years,

05:57.640 --> 05:59.899
he claimed, without success.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.979
This is an amazing find.

06:01.980 --> 06:04.139
I agree.
Even more amazing

06:04.140 --> 06:06.899
because our scans indicate
there's something hot in there.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.729
What do you mean, "hot"?

06:08.730 --> 06:11.729
Something inside that ship
is generating energy.

06:11.730 --> 06:14.269
I wanted to investigate
right away, but...

06:14.278 --> 06:15.854
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s treaty
with Wakanda

06:15.855 --> 06:18.729
requires a royal be present at any
find of our ancient technology.

06:18.730 --> 06:21.349
[WHITNEY]
Technology that old...

06:21.350 --> 06:23.172
still functioning...

06:23.770 --> 06:26.599
after so many centuries
in the ice.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.519
Do you know how amazing that is?

06:29.520 --> 06:33.139
[CHUCKLES] Guess these
Wakandans build to last, huh?

06:33.140 --> 06:35.519
We have to save this ship.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.854
Indeed we do.
Captain, a word, please.

06:40.230 --> 06:43.014
You think the final key segment
is in there, don't you?

06:43.270 --> 06:45.729
My grandfather had many secrets,

06:45.730 --> 06:47.528
and he hid
the key pieces in places

06:47.529 --> 06:50.019
he thought no one would think
to look for them.

06:50.020 --> 06:52.059
I believe this ship qualifies.

06:52.060 --> 06:54.269
If it is in there
and we can get it,

06:54.270 --> 06:56.849
we'll definitely be a step ahead
of the Shadow Council.

06:56.850 --> 07:01.089
Hey, kids, you got something you wanna
share with the rest of the class?

07:01.090 --> 07:03.569
No? Okay, well,
since the gang's all here,

07:03.570 --> 07:05.859
maybe it's a good time to take
a look inside that thing.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.249
Yes, it is.
Follow me.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.249
Oh, I like him.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.052
He's decisive.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.459
[IMITATING BLACK PANTHER]
"Yes, it is. Follow me."

07:16.460 --> 07:18.811

07:19.000 --> 07:20.520
Clint, give it a rest.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.129
Okay, I'm just gonna ask.

07:30.130 --> 07:32.999
This boat's been in the ice
for a really long time, right?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.589
Correct.

07:34.590 --> 07:38.459
Well, not to be gross,
but where's the crew?

07:38.460 --> 07:41.669
Doesn't look like anyone alive
was ever on this thing.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.419
This ship did not require
a human crew.

07:44.420 --> 07:47.629
The captain used a control mask to
command the ship from the bridge.

07:47.630 --> 07:50.420
I guess we're going
to the bridge.

07:54.750 --> 07:58.342
[BLACK PANTHER] Use caution. We do
not know which systems are active.

07:59.351 --> 08:01.959
Looks like the control mask
is missing.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.772
We do not need it to reboot
the ship's gyroforge.

08:05.380 --> 08:07.380
And we're doing that why?
[ASCENDING WHIRRING]

08:07.381 --> 08:10.959
A controlled reboot of the ship's systems
will make it safer for us to explore.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.129
You had gyroforge technology
that long ago?

08:14.130 --> 08:17.959
It is rudimentary by modern standards.

We have activated
the internal defense system.

08:37.309 --> 08:39.139

as intruders.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.689
Of course not.
That would be too easy.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.565
What's the problem,
Dr. Frost?

10:09.566 --> 10:11.439
The wiring, power conductors.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.139
The casings are corroded
after so long underwater.

10:14.140 --> 10:16.479
[BLACK PANTHER]
They are heating the hull.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.719
Great. Really old ship
sinking into the ocean.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.509
- Time to evacuate.
- No. Not yet.

10:22.510 --> 10:25.679
If we can shut down the gyroforge,
the hull will cool down,

10:25.680 --> 10:27.299
the ice will refreeze.

10:27.300 --> 10:30.099
That, uh, sounds like
it's gonna take time.

10:30.100 --> 10:33.049

All of you.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.219
But what about
all this technology?

10:35.220 --> 10:38.969
It is not worth your lives.
You must go, now.

10:38.970 --> 10:41.259

You can help by getting
Dr. Frost to safety.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.509
Now, Clint, go.

11:12.510 --> 11:16.639

11:16.640 --> 11:19.185
[SIGHS]
Okay, Whitney, let's...

11:20.550 --> 11:24.932
Oh, come on! Does everybody on

11:28.185 --> 11:30.509
The key segment
was not on the bridge.

11:30.510 --> 11:33.889
It is likely my grandfather hid it in the
captain's quarters for enhanced security.

11:33.890 --> 11:36.340
What do you mean
by "enhanced security"?

11:39.430 --> 11:41.099
The quartermaster.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.367
It is on a separate system
from the rest.

11:44.274 --> 11:45.550

11:49.949 --> 11:51.549

as a "yes."

The blades are pure Vibranium.
The skeleton is only alloy.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.389
What happens if we sever
the limbs from the alloy?

Let us find out.

After you, Your Majesty.

12:31.550 --> 12:33.619
Yemandi.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.719
How do we find the key segment in
all of this? If it's even here.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.389
We do not.
The search will take time.

12:40.390 --> 12:42.629
You must go now, Captain,
before the ship sinks.

12:42.654 --> 12:43.680
No, not happening.

12:43.683 --> 12:46.929
I signed on for this secret Avengers
thing to help you. I'll see it through.

12:46.930 --> 12:50.179
Our secrets are hurting your
relationships with the Avengers.

12:50.180 --> 12:51.700
With Hawkeye, certainly.

12:51.701 --> 12:53.219
We're wasting time, T'Challa.

12:53.220 --> 12:55.599
We came for the key segment.
Where do we start looking?

12:55.600 --> 13:00.754
The ship is centuries old, but Grandfather
would have found it only decades ago.

13:01.510 --> 13:04.429
So, we're looking for something
that's out of place.

13:04.430 --> 13:07.550
Precisely.
Something like that.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.759
We have it, Captain.

we can work together, we can...

Doc, boat's sinking.
Time to go.

13:39.550 --> 13:42.259
I can save it.
I have to save it.

13:42.260 --> 13:46.151
I'm saving you. This thing is
just a tub of old junk. It's...

13:46.151 --> 13:48.839
Is that what you see?
Wakandan technology

13:48.840 --> 13:52.139
is centuries ahead of the rest of the
world, but they don't share, Clint.

13:52.140 --> 13:56.469
If we save this ship, if we can
study it, even for an hour,

13:56.470 --> 13:58.543
we can learn so
much about every...

[CAPTAIN AMERICA] Hawkeye,

14:35.190 --> 14:37.979
Nothing. I don't know if that
means they got out, or...

14:37.980 --> 14:40.349
[GROANS]
We must get to the bridge.

14:40.350 --> 14:43.349
If Dr. Frost and Hawkeye are
still aboard, we cannot leave.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.349
We must try and save
the entire ship.

Yeah. About that.
There was this whole

Useless. My armor's
technology is too advanced.

There is no way for us
to get control of the ship.

16:19.730 --> 16:21.685
There might be one way.

16:21.686 --> 16:23.639
The control mask!
Where did you find it?

16:23.640 --> 16:26.559
Does it matter?
I can use it to save us.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.639
The mask is too unpredictable
to be used safely.

You cannot do this.

it is interfacing,

connecting her brain
directly to the ship's systems.
