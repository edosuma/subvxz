00:02.043 --> 00:03.586
<i>My brother and I always dreamt</i>

00:03.586 --> 00:05.338
<i>of becoming the greatest of all time.</i>

00:05.463 --> 00:08.049
<i>And for one of us,
that dream was about to come true.</i>

00:14.305 --> 00:19.644
<i>And so the 2031 championship
comes down to one last possession.</i>

00:19.936 --> 00:23.606
<i>Bell bringing it up, crosses him over,
shakes free at mid-court.</i>

00:23.773 --> 00:26.735
<i>- He elevates. Finishes. And a foul!</i>

00:26.985 --> 00:30.405
<i>But, oh, he's down.
Looks like he hurt his shooting hand.</i>

00:31.448 --> 00:33.908
<i>Wait a minute. He is staying in the game.</i>

00:34.659 --> 00:35.910
<i>Point three seconds left.</i>

00:36.077 --> 00:40.040
<i>It's all up to this rookie MVP
to make the shot.</i>

00:40.582 --> 00:42.625
Game on the line, kid. Don't brick it.

00:42.959 --> 00:47.297
<i>Every GOAT needs
to have talent, timing, and teachers.</i>

00:48.214 --> 00:50.508
<i>Dad's basketball rule number 21.</i>

00:51.176 --> 00:52.260
<i>Plan to win.</i>

00:52.677 --> 00:53.720
<i>Play your game.</i>

00:57.557 --> 01:00.351
<i>Prepare to adjust.</i>

01:01.686 --> 01:04.189
That's a bad look, Filthy. Go, baby.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.356
Let's do it.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.573
Ooh!

01:13.698 --> 01:16.367
Must be a dentist
'cause that was in his grill!

01:16.367 --> 01:17.744
<i>Ball was our life.</i>

01:17.869 --> 01:20.747
<i>There was only one word
in our dictionary, win.</i>

01:20.914 --> 01:23.208
I'm dribblin' at the top of the key.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.795
I'm movin' and groovin'.
I'm poppin' and rockin'.

01:27.003 --> 01:29.214
Why you bumpin'? Why you lockin'?

01:29.339 --> 01:31.132
Man, take this thumpin'.

01:31.382 --> 01:34.094
- Bro, just play ball, man! What you got?
- This right here for you.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.846
<i>Muhammad Ali
and Deion Sanders didn't just talk.</i>

01:37.013 --> 01:40.767
<i>They were truth tellers and day dreamers.
Top of their game rhyme schemers.</i>

01:40.767 --> 01:43.061
<i>Just like me. Words matter, bro.</i>

01:45.230 --> 01:49.359
<i>Josh Bell's the name.
Filthy McNasty's the claim to fame.</i>

01:49.359 --> 01:51.611
<i>Dad dubbed me that
'cause my game's acclaimed.</i>

01:51.736 --> 01:54.656
<i>So downright dirty,
it'll put you to shame.</i>

01:55.573 --> 01:56.699
Come on, baby. Let's go.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.994
<i>Jordan Bell,
also known as JB.</i>

01:59.994 --> 02:04.624
<i>When he shoots from deep, believe.
His jumper falls like leaves.</i>

02:12.465 --> 02:15.760
Battle of the Bells. Game point!
Let's go, Filthy!

02:15.760 --> 02:19.389
<i>Chuck Bell's Da Man.
Balled from LA to Japan.</i>

02:19.389 --> 02:23.393
<i>Game was super bad.
But now he's just our super dad.</i>

02:24.310 --> 02:25.895
Come on, man.
You got to do better than that.

02:28.356 --> 02:31.276
<i>The Crossover.
Staple of all great ballers.</i>

02:31.484 --> 02:33.945
<i>Iverson, Kyrie, D-Will.</i>

02:34.070 --> 02:37.240
<i>A simple move where a player
quickly dribbles from one hand to another.</i>

02:37.240 --> 02:40.451
<i>As in, think I'm going one way, but...</i>

02:44.706 --> 02:47.375
Booyah!
Yeah, come on, now.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.002
- Come on! Ah!
-  Get some crutches,

02:49.127 --> 02:50.628
- he broke both of his ankles!
- Yeah!

02:50.628 --> 02:54.591
Uh-uh, uh-uh. No. Uh-uh-uh.
Basketball rule number one.

02:54.841 --> 02:58.803
In the game of life, family is the court,
basketball is the heart.

02:58.803 --> 03:01.055
Always leave your heart on the court.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.724
Win or lose, y'all play together.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.813
- All right, boys. Now, if I make this?

03:09.397 --> 03:10.815
- Donuts.
- All right, let's see.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.326
<i>What a difference</i>

03:22.202 --> 03:24.412
<i>A day makes</i>

03:25.205 --> 03:28.833
<i>Twenty-four little hours</i>

03:30.126 --> 03:33.421
<i>Brought the sun and the flowers</i>

03:34.923 --> 03:38.676
<i>Where there used to be rain</i>

03:38.843 --> 03:43.097
<i>My yesterday was blue, dear</i>

03:43.097 --> 03:44.557
Hey, you know
who's better than Kobe?

03:44.557 --> 03:46.226
Who?
Michael Jordan.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.518
What?
There you go.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.312
Better than the Mamba?
Yeah.

03:51.814 --> 03:54.651
...ever! They visualized victory!
MJ made it happen.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.402
<i>Dr. Crystal Bell.</i>

03:56.694 --> 04:01.449
<i>All-star scholar. Fam shot-caller.
Beloved, dear Mama.</i>

04:02.116 --> 04:05.954
Mom! Please tell these guys,
in your opinion, who is the GOAT?

04:06.079 --> 04:09.165
Oh. That's easy. Chuck "Da Man" Bell.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.625
- Am I right?
That's right.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.585
Baby, you know the rule.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.587
No basketball at the table.

04:15.004 --> 04:17.840
And you two, homework, dinner, then bed.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.885
Wait, what about dessert? Dad won donuts.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.220
Okay.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.932
- You gotta play my game.
- Let's go!

04:26.057 --> 04:27.976
Spelling bee. "Aerial."

04:30.144 --> 04:31.813
- All right.
- Oh, no, no. I was thinking.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.982
- I was thinkin' of the word. "Ariel."
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

04:34.190 --> 04:38.361
A-R-I-E-L. Was a little mermaid
who lived under the sea.

04:38.778 --> 04:42.031
<i>Under the sea, under the sea</i>

04:42.031 --> 04:45.368
You gonna be living under the sea
if I don't hear it spelled correctly.

04:45.576 --> 04:46.786
"Aerial."

04:47.287 --> 04:49.205
A-E-R-I-A-L.

04:49.497 --> 04:53.376
<i>As in, flying up above
As in, birds in the air</i>

04:53.584 --> 04:57.255
<i>As in, Filthy soars to places
Eagles wouldn't dare</i>

04:58.214 --> 05:00.300
Okay.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.302
Seems like someone's been studying.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.595
- Thank you.
- And someone hasn't.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.308
Your English teacher tells me
that you've got missing work.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.268
Hey, Chuck, what does that tell us?

05:12.103 --> 05:13.980
That you're not managing your time

05:14.397 --> 05:16.399
or maybe basketball
is taking too much of it.

05:16.399 --> 05:20.069
- Hey, babe, don't blame it on the game.
- I'm not blaming the game or the coach.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.656
But I'm reminding you that getting into
a good high school requires good grades.

05:24.115 --> 05:27.243
- JB, that proposal cannot be late.
- What proposal?

05:27.368 --> 05:30.580
Oh, it's our semester paper
for English class. The Passion Project.

05:30.913 --> 05:34.584
It's about what we'll do
when we get older, or what we love now.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.377
I'm doing hoops.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.297
Good man. Same for you, huh, JB?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.300
What else?

05:42.717 --> 05:45.261
Boy, if you miss this deadline,
you're gonna drop to a C.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.931
So turn it in before the Lakeside game
or you won't play.

05:49.557 --> 05:50.808
- What?
- What?

05:52.226 --> 05:54.854
- Chuck.
- You heard your mom. Come on now.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.397
I got a winning game plan,

05:56.564 --> 05:59.150
but my best shooter
is about to be benched?

05:59.275 --> 06:01.778
With Ace Howard,
head coach of Beacon Academy,

06:01.778 --> 06:02.904
sitting in the bleachers?

06:07.700 --> 06:08.910
Ace Howard's gonna be there?

06:09.035 --> 06:13.122
He has coached, like, five pro players!
We're talking NBA pipeline.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.957
He sees us beat the champs, and we're in!

06:15.208 --> 06:18.461
Yeah. Well, it starts with JB
beating this proposal.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.255
I am about GPA, not NBA.

06:21.255 --> 06:24.550
Mom, don't even worry about it, okay?
He's got this. I'll make sure of it.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.135
All right.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.597
Hey! Don't you dare eat both those,
put it down. Put it...

06:29.597 --> 06:30.765
Hey.
- Put it...

06:32.100 --> 06:34.685
- Put it down. Exactly...
- I'm eating you, right? Come on, girl.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.813
Okay.

06:49.283 --> 06:50.993
- Yo!
- Who are you texting?

06:50.993 --> 06:53.371
I'm not texting and why
are you snatching off my headphones?

06:53.371 --> 06:55.581
- Hey, you wanna hear my new beat?
- I wanna see you do your work.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.291
Look, that whole page is blank.

06:57.291 --> 07:00.878
- The passion proposal part is easy.
- You know I'm not good at papers.

07:02.839 --> 07:03.840
Check this out.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.426
Come on. Let me show you something.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.679
You're missing out on that beat.
I know "Headphones,"

07:09.679 --> 07:11.889
but this is what I do care about.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.853
Step one. Get into Beacon for high school.

07:17.228 --> 07:22.066
Step two. College ball. Final Four,
me versus you. I win.

07:22.191 --> 07:24.861
Step three. Get drafted to the Lakers.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.989
And step four.
Retiring to the NBA Hall of Fame

07:27.989 --> 07:29.198
as the new GOATs.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.242
You remember when we made this, right?

07:31.576 --> 07:33.411
I made it, you talked about it.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.496
And I never agreed
with all of step two, man.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.748
My bad, I just thought
it might inspire something.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.334
Bro, Dad is a baller
with a championship ring.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.961
That's inspiration enough.

07:44.046 --> 07:46.799
Look, you cannot miss this game, JB.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.552
Promise me that
that proposal's gonna be fire.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.512
It's gonna be lava, bro. Promise.

07:52.513 --> 07:53.764
Throwing socks now?

08:05.318 --> 08:06.819
What's up?
What's good, Vondie?

08:07.820 --> 08:08.821
Hey, Maya. Psych!

08:09.780 --> 08:11.115
- What's up, G?
- Okay.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.454
<i>Quick shoulder shake, a slick eye fake</i>

08:16.454 --> 08:18.623
<i>Oh, JB's too late</i>

08:18.789 --> 08:22.084
<i>Vondie's reading me like a book
But I got him shook</i>

08:22.335 --> 08:25.046
<i>'Cause his feet are the bank
And I am the...</i>

08:25.046 --> 08:26.088
Crook!

08:26.589 --> 08:29.008
You gotta work on those handles,
Langston Hughes.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.468
All that game

08:30.468 --> 08:32.345
- but Maya made you look lame.
- Whatever.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.473
<i>Maya the Defiant plus
Vondie the Giant</i>

08:35.765 --> 08:38.142
<i>make up this crew
like a superhero alliance.</i>

08:38.142 --> 08:41.020
All right, all right, all right,
Filthy, I'm on deadline for the paper.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.357
Lakeside beat you by 26
in last year's championship. Thoughts?

08:44.357 --> 08:46.734
- You can ask me. I was there, too.
- Yeah, but...

08:46.859 --> 08:49.487
Uh, your rival school led by Zuma Rivers,

08:49.487 --> 08:51.989
one of the top-most ranked players
in the state.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.699
Who nasty-dunked in your face.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.868
- Okay, really, bruh?
- Will Zuma best you again?

08:56.577 --> 08:58.955
<i>That fool's getting schooled, uncooled</i>

08:59.330 --> 09:02.583
<i>'Cause when Filthy gets hot
He got a slammerific shot</i>

09:02.792 --> 09:06.254
<i>It's supersonic sassy
Dunkalicious classy</i>

09:06.254 --> 09:09.757
<i>- And downright in your face McNasty!</i>
All right.

09:11.008 --> 09:11.884
<i>Good morning.</i>

09:12.510 --> 09:15.137
Ooh, someone is dressed for success.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.390
Interview with the superintendent
this afternoon.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.686
- Ooh. I am nervous.
- No, don't be.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.397
You're already doing the principal's job
in an acting capacity.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.565
- Oh!
- You've taught,

09:25.690 --> 09:27.942
you've been an administrator,
and the kids love you here.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.236
- Mm-hmm. Hey, hey, hey! Unless Cardi B

09:30.236 --> 09:31.445
is making a surprise appearance

09:31.445 --> 09:34.490
at the end of the hallway,
there is no running in it.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.951
Sorry Dr. Bell!
- But look, if she is, let me know. Okurr?

09:37.076 --> 09:40.580
Principal Bell
will not be denied.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.290
Hmm. Thank you, girl.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.880
What's up, little man?
Hey, Vondie.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.596
Hey! They got DJ Semple Plan
for the Fall Dance.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.389
Are you asking anyone to go, Filthy?

09:59.098 --> 10:00.850
Uh, no, I thought we were
all going together.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.648
- Josh?

10:07.940 --> 10:12.153
<i>Close your eyes, make a wish</i>

10:13.029 --> 10:16.907
<i>And blow out the candlelight</i>

10:17.033 --> 10:20.453
- Josh? Josh, say hello.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.497
Hi, Josh. Do you remember me?

10:23.873 --> 10:26.751
- What's up, Alexis? Do you go here now?
- Yeah. I just moved back.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.420
My parents split.
So now, I gotta split my time.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.548
- Oh, wow. I'm sorry to hear, Alexis.
It's okay, it happens.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.677
- Love the hair, Josh.
- Filthy's wings. They let him fly.

10:36.677 --> 10:40.056
Yeah, yeah, will you walk Alexis
to Ms. Rojas-Pierre's class please?

10:42.475 --> 10:43.643
Okay.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.730
Use your fingertips.

10:49.774 --> 10:50.858
<i>Pulchritudinous.</i>

10:51.651 --> 10:57.239
<i>Having great physical beauty or appeal.
As in, "Alexis was pulchritudinous."</i>

10:57.615 --> 11:01.494
<i>As in, "I'd never had a girlfriend
but if I did, she'd be pulchritudinous."</i>

11:07.375 --> 11:11.045
- Hey, he needs to align his chakras.
- No. He needs to bend his knees.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.838
Are you allergic to freebies?

11:13.172 --> 11:15.800
Come on, son. I want you
to shoot with the fingertips.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.968
All right, you square up, bend your knees.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.553
Bro, chill.
- Follow through. Hey!

11:20.805 --> 11:24.642
What are you doing? I'm over here
coming up with the Xs and Os for Lakeside.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.310
- And you're dancing?
- Come on Pops, I'm just...

11:26.435 --> 11:28.813
Okay, all of you,
I want you to run six laps

11:28.813 --> 11:31.691
while you wait your turn. Go!
Gio, get 'em, go!

11:31.691 --> 11:33.359
Come on! You heard the man.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.985
Let's go! Move, move.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.365
Look... (CLEARS THROAT) ...now I know

11:39.865 --> 11:43.661
that you're excited about Coach Howard
coming and getting into Beacon...

11:45.162 --> 11:48.457
but the big picture's for later.
Basketball rule number ten.

11:48.791 --> 11:52.086
It's one shot, one stop,
one game at a time.

11:54.463 --> 11:57.425
All right, run, run. Move, move! Groove!

12:02.430 --> 12:05.182
Chuck! Chuck!

12:05.349 --> 12:07.268
- Hey Chuck! Hey, you all right?
Dad! Dad, you good?

12:07.393 --> 12:09.687
- Yo, somebody call 911!

12:10.229 --> 12:12.273
All right, you're good. Hold on, Dad.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.819
<i>Despite everything going on,</i>

12:16.944 --> 12:19.238
<i>I know what Da Man would say.
"Keep ballin.</i>

12:19.947 --> 12:22.491
<i>"'Cause the minute you stop
playing your game, you already lost."</i>

12:22.616 --> 12:23.993
<i>Look, I don't care where we play.</i>

12:23.993 --> 12:25.745
<i>Yeah.
- All right, I'll beat the Bells</i>

12:25.745 --> 12:28.914
<i>at their house, our house,
or the Waffle House. All right?</i>

12:28.914 --> 12:34.128
<i>It's not a thing they can do.
Especially you, Filthy. Yeah, Lakeside!</i>

12:42.887 --> 12:44.930
- Dad.
Oh, boy!

12:45.389 --> 12:46.348
Hmm.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.018
What happened, Dad? You okay?
Yeah.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.312
I'm fine. I'm fine, okay?

12:52.438 --> 12:56.192
I'm fine. I'm Chuck "Da Man" Bell.
What do you kids say? I'm "Gucci"?

12:56.317 --> 12:59.612
Yes, kids said that, in elementary school.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.405
Oh, be nice.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.366
For real, Dad. Are you okay?

13:05.951 --> 13:08.204
- It was just an asthma attack.
Asthma?

13:08.537 --> 13:10.539
Asthma never sent you
to the hospital before.

13:10.539 --> 13:14.210
Look, your dad just needs rest
and a few days off. Okay?

13:15.711 --> 13:17.838
Few days? What about practice?

13:18.798 --> 13:19.924
For now, I'm on the bench.

13:20.257 --> 13:23.719
The bench? Dad, you're not coaching?
You've never not coached us.

13:23.719 --> 13:24.804
Gio can't coach!

13:24.970 --> 13:26.764
He doesn't even know the plays.
Not like you do.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.724
Okay, listen, he has my playbook.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.268
Unless his chakras is messed up,
you are good.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.107
Now, come on. The game is on soon.
We'll stop by Pollards' Wings,

13:37.483 --> 13:39.443
get the Wing-a-Palooza. Right?

13:39.819 --> 13:40.986
What kind you like?

13:42.655 --> 13:43.781
Fine.

13:43.906 --> 13:47.910
No Wing-a-Palooza.
I can't even watch the game?

13:48.035 --> 13:51.872
Not without acting
like a madman. You heard the doctor.

13:51.997 --> 13:56.085
- I've had asthma all my life, babe.
- It's not just that, and you know it.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.421
Your blood pressure's high.
Your cholesterol is ugly.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.423
Don't mess with me on this, Chuck.

14:01.924 --> 14:05.219
Your dad ignored all his symptoms
until it was too late to do anything.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.596
I know. All right.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.474
Oh, man. Wait, you missed your interview.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.227
Hand me the rest of the pillows.

14:14.144 --> 14:17.189
I, um, I... I went.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.483
And?

14:21.110 --> 14:22.319
And?

14:22.444 --> 14:24.697
And...

14:26.156 --> 14:27.283
I got the job.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.410
- You got the job?
- I got the job.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.287
- Babe, come here.
- Yeah.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.664
- I got the job.
- You Dr. Principal Bell?

14:33.789 --> 14:36.292
- You did it? Babe, I'm so proud of you.
-  Calm down.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.461
Babe, you gonna be
the GOAT principal.

14:39.628 --> 14:40.963
- You tell the boys?

14:41.088 --> 14:42.464
Honey, we gotta celebrate!

14:42.464 --> 14:45.843
Listen, I'm gonna tell the boys.
You need rest.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.261
- But, babe, this is major.
- Calm down.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.470
- Is it?
Yeah.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.892
- I mean, my heart love got her dream gig.
- Mm-hmm.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.978
Wow, I see big things.

14:56.103 --> 14:58.147
Oh.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.567
- And I see sleep or reading.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.694
- No TV.
- Ah.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.404
- That's cold-blooded.
- Mm-hmm.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.534
- Doctor.
Night.

15:21.211 --> 15:23.130
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.045
Yo, bro, you asleep?
- Nah.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.258
What're we gonna do?

16:10.302 --> 16:11.762
About Zuma?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.597
I was thinking
maybe a clap back video, but...

16:13.722 --> 16:15.933
Not Zuma, about Dad.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.103
Dad's fine.
Doctor said it was just asthma.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.606
- That's scary, man. I'm worried.
- Worry about finishing that proposal.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.942
Look, we gotta show
Coach Howard how we do.

16:24.942 --> 16:28.028
Basketball rule number 16.
If you wanna be the man,

16:28.362 --> 16:31.782
- you gotta stick to the plan.
- Plans change, Josh. Clearly.

16:31.907 --> 16:32.992
Nothing changes.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.786
We ball, and we win.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.293
- JB?
- Do the proposal. Yeah, I got it.

16:43.877 --> 16:44.962
Nah, bruh.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.756
You wanna help me
pick out some clothes for tomorrow?

16:50.050 --> 16:51.969
You finally figured out Maya likes you?

16:51.969 --> 16:57.182
Nah, man, we're just friends.
I, uh, I just wanna look nice, that's it.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.727
Like who? Anybody come to mind?

17:00.769 --> 17:01.895
Oh, here we go.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.942
Just trust me. I got you, bro.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.862
- You got me.

17:10.237 --> 17:13.907
It was pretty scary there.
Yeah, I pretty much hate hospitals.

17:14.408 --> 17:18.454
- Anyway, I hope your dad's okay.
- He is, he's just not coaching,

17:19.121 --> 17:22.332
which is really scary,
because losing this game would be...

17:24.168 --> 17:25.169
abysmal.

17:27.004 --> 17:29.506
Abysmal, as in, unfathomable.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.760
As in, "These fries are abysmal."

17:32.885 --> 17:35.095
- What?
- As in hopelessly bad.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.472
All right, say that then, bro.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.474
Always using these big old words.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.267
- My bad.
- Hey, if you don't want your fries,

17:40.476 --> 17:42.478
- I'll eat 'em.
Hands off.

17:42.936 --> 17:45.689
- Oh, wow. You, too?
So...

17:46.440 --> 17:47.691
what if Coach can't coach again?

17:47.858 --> 17:50.986
Why do you keep talking about how he is?
I said he's fine!

17:50.986 --> 17:52.321
Let your neck breathe, dawg.

17:52.571 --> 17:56.366
Sometimes it's annoying when people care,
but it's worse when they don't.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.412
What's up?

18:00.954 --> 18:02.081
Shoot!

18:02.790 --> 18:03.916
Yo, chill.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.085
- Wow! Hey, guys.
Hey.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.003
Oh, um...

18:09.797 --> 18:10.798
nice shirt.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.302
- I'm sure JB picked out his fit.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.679
Oh. Mr. Fashion.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.307
Okay, I see you, JB.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.144
Filthy hoops, but he has zero swag.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.562
Yeah, yeah.

18:25.562 --> 18:28.607
- Yeah, my man's swag is abysmal, huh?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.609
As in, unfathomable.
No.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.736
<i>Where's my snacks?</i>

18:48.585 --> 18:49.795
Hmm.

18:51.004 --> 18:54.967
Chuck is going to be fine.
Can we focus on you and your new job?

18:54.967 --> 18:58.262
-  Girl, I'm still in shock.
- You're ready for this.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.638
- Am I?
- Yes.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.306
- I need a new wardrobe.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.183
I have to attend conferences
every weekend.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.519
Constantly balance the budget.
Meet the board.

19:05.519 --> 19:08.147
And now Chuck has to do
an entire battery of medical tests.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.398
And the boys are...

19:10.774 --> 19:13.068
- Still no answer.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.497
What can I say in my defense?

19:28.083 --> 19:30.043
<i>Here we go.
And we're back in the game.</i>

19:30.043 --> 19:32.379
<i>Oh, he doubles back, passes on to six.</i>

19:32.880 --> 19:34.631
<i>Here we go. Emerson up for two.</i>

19:34.923 --> 19:37.885
<i>Boom! It's raining from downtown.
That brings him up...</i>

19:38.343 --> 19:40.387
- Hey, yo, can we talk?
- After the game.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.643
Do you remember when Maya's mom
was just supposed to be in the hospital

19:46.643 --> 19:49.062
- for a few weeks and then...
Yes,

19:49.605 --> 19:53.901
I do remember and it sucked.
But right now, our biggest problem

19:53.901 --> 19:57.404
is a 14-year-old Steph Curry look-alike
who can shoot our lights out.

19:57.529 --> 20:01.867
Our biggest problem is that Dad is sick!
Stop hiding behind ball, Josh.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.410
I'm not hiding behind anything.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.787
I'm focused on what matters
and you're not.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.416
So whatever, I don't need you.
I'll beat Lakeside by myself.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.793
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What's going on in here?

20:11.960 --> 20:15.047
I know you not squaring off, in my house?

20:15.172 --> 20:16.715
He is blowing the Lakeside game

20:16.840 --> 20:19.009
and our chance to get into Beacon
and he doesn't even care.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.385
I care about Dad, and you don't.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.471
- I do care, Jordan.
- Quiet, now!

20:23.013 --> 20:25.682
Let me tell you something.
I need you to hear me.

20:26.433 --> 20:29.603
Things happen.
Life comes at you hard and fast.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.854
Like Zion Williamson.

20:32.981 --> 20:35.943
- I pay attention.
- This is a team, boys.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.111
We celebrate wins and we console losses,

20:38.278 --> 20:41.240
but no matter what happens,
you're a net tied together.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.575
That's right, you boys are connected.

20:43.700 --> 20:47.246
And you always will be.
So, whatever this is,

20:48.080 --> 20:49.790
put it behind you.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.502
Sorry.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.673
Filthy, free throws.
And you, finish the proposal.

21:10.185 --> 21:14.523
<i>We're destined for greatness
Nobody ever thought we would make it</i>

21:14.856 --> 21:16.692
<i>Watch how far we take it</i>

21:16.817 --> 21:20.487
<i>Pass the stars and spaceships
From a city where the music is sacred</i>

21:20.487 --> 21:23.824
<i>504 You're in the presence of a rebel now</i>

21:23.824 --> 21:26.535
<i>Yeah we about to take it
To another level now</i>

21:26.535 --> 21:28.829
<i>'Bout time everybody got together now</i>

21:28.829 --> 21:31.540
<i>Things are looking better now
We can live forever now</i>

21:35.836 --> 21:37.546
Are you working or texting?

21:43.802 --> 21:45.012
JB...

21:46.263 --> 21:49.308
Mom, I'm not like Filthy.

21:50.767 --> 21:51.852
What do you mean?

21:55.897 --> 21:57.899
He loves basketball more than anything.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.405
Ooh, play it off.
- What if I just like it?

22:06.450 --> 22:07.617
What would Dad say?

22:09.119 --> 22:11.538
You think that's all you have in common
with your father?

22:23.216 --> 22:26.386
I think he would say that he still
loves his son no matter what.

22:28.055 --> 22:32.225
Look, I know the game is a lot,
especially around here.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.271
But it's not everything, JB.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.274
- Okay?
- All right.

22:42.652 --> 22:44.571
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.240
Get that proposal done.

23:00.170 --> 23:03.006
<i>You got this, right?</i>

23:07.094 --> 23:09.596
- Bro, are you serious?
- Come on.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.350
Do you even care about the game?

23:15.602 --> 23:16.937
Listen, Miss Janice...

23:18.855 --> 23:20.148
I didn't write a proposal.

23:21.149 --> 23:24.986
But I did kinda work on something.
And I can tell you about it after class.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.531
That was not the assignment.

23:28.031 --> 23:30.200
- I know, but...
I'll tell you what.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.869
I am willing to make an exception, but...

23:35.414 --> 23:37.749
only if you share your passion
with the class.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.507
You... you mean now? Out loud?

24:00.313 --> 24:05.861
How can you shoot for your passion
when the goal is so far away?

24:09.448 --> 24:10.699
This is what I know.

24:13.535 --> 24:17.789
<i>Basketball is in my life
But it is not my life</i>

24:21.710 --> 24:24.713
<i>My photography skills are sweet
And I love making beats</i>

24:26.590 --> 24:29.426
<i>I'm really into clothes
Be cool to design 'em</i>

24:29.426 --> 24:31.970
<i>I like cooking food so maybe I'll dine 'em</i>

24:33.555 --> 24:38.602
<i>Basketball rule number 39
Sometimes you gotta take a time... out</i>

24:38.977 --> 24:41.813
<i>Percolate, as in, discover your greatness</i>

24:41.813 --> 24:47.611
<i>As in, I'm 13, I'm still searching
My sole passion? I have no idea</i>

24:49.029 --> 24:50.280
<i>But here's what's clear</i>

24:50.864 --> 24:52.866
<i>I'm gonna percolate this whole year</i>

24:55.368 --> 24:58.705
<i>Then maybe I can present
My masterpiece to you</i>

25:01.458 --> 25:02.542
<i>And you</i>

25:04.753 --> 25:05.837
<i>And you</i>

25:08.423 --> 25:09.466
<i>And me</i>

25:13.011 --> 25:14.554
Good.

25:14.971 --> 25:16.014
Nice.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.349
Hey!

25:19.392 --> 25:20.393
Yo, man!

25:23.688 --> 25:26.900
Unconventional. But provocative.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.110
I can't wait to learn what you discover.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.530
Percolate on, Mr. Bell.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.908
<i>From day one, we'd shared our passion.</i>

25:35.992 --> 25:38.703
<i>But it seemed JB's heart
was in another place.</i>

25:41.373 --> 25:43.458
Let's go!

25:43.667 --> 25:45.210
Go Lions!

25:47.087 --> 25:49.464
<i>A good hero needs
a great villain to battle.</i>

25:50.048 --> 25:51.174
<i>Zuma was mine.</i>

25:51.591 --> 25:54.928
You got hops but you still mine, Filthy.
Just like last season.

25:55.303 --> 25:58.557
Your breath smells like
you ain't brushed it since last season.

26:05.689 --> 26:06.815
It's gonna be a long night.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.527
Hey, I'm nervous for you.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.320
Look, coach from Beacon Academy is here.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.573
Chuck "Da Man." Crystal.
Hey. Coach Howard.

26:14.864 --> 26:18.535
- Gonna be a great game tonight.
- Yeah, your boys, they got a great coach.

26:20.203 --> 26:22.872
- Mm-hmm.
- A benched coach, you hear me?

26:23.206 --> 26:26.376
The only reason why I let you come
is 'cause you said you'd stay calm.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.503
Uh, I'm totally zen, Principal Bell.

26:28.503 --> 26:31.089
Oh, stop it. You know that's not official
till Monday.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.924
I hope I'm ready for it.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.635
I've known you all my life.
It's nothing you can't handle.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.221
- Aw.
- Mm-hmm. I know it's early,

26:38.221 --> 26:40.390
- but do you think I can get a raise?
- No.

26:40.390 --> 26:41.766
<i>When obstacles arise,</i>

26:41.766 --> 26:46.646
<i>Dad always said, "Put on your game face.
Full court press your fears.</i>

26:46.813 --> 26:50.275
<i>"Keep your eyes on the ball.
And never lose sight of the goal."</i>

26:53.028 --> 26:54.904
Filthy looks nervous, I hope he's okay.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.742
- You checking for him?

27:00.619 --> 27:01.661
He's looking.

27:03.496 --> 27:04.831
I'm that obvious, huh?

27:05.373 --> 27:07.000
- Little bit.

27:13.673 --> 27:17.093
Bend your knees, square up,
follow through, come on.

27:19.387 --> 27:20.430
Yeah.

27:24.893 --> 27:25.935
Pass it!

27:37.364 --> 27:39.783
<i>Dad, Coach, Alexis.</i>

27:40.075 --> 27:43.536
<i>It's so easy to fold under the weight
of heavy expectations,</i>

27:43.662 --> 27:45.288
<i>when all eyes are on you.</i>

27:48.708 --> 27:50.168
Filthy, you've gotta do this!

27:51.044 --> 27:52.962
Run the play, Filthy!

27:53.380 --> 27:56.424
Sit down and calm yourself
or you're out of here this second.

27:59.260 --> 28:02.055
Go! Come on!
Right there!

28:05.141 --> 28:06.267
Come on!

28:09.688 --> 28:11.231
Told you it's gonna be
a long night, boy!

28:11.356 --> 28:14.693
Bring it in! Bring it in!
<i>Yeah, it was, as in...</i>

28:14.859 --> 28:17.445
This game is a fiasco, all right?
It's clearly not going as planned.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.864
'Cause you're a ball hog.
You're not even passing to JB!

28:19.864 --> 28:23.576
- Oh, really? Get a rebound, Vondie!
- When you hit a shot, maybe I would!

28:23.576 --> 28:25.286
That doesn't even make sense.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.207
Yo, come on.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.334
We on the same team.

28:34.170 --> 28:36.589
There is a lot of game left, man.
Let's turn it around.

28:36.589 --> 28:39.134
- We gotta visualize victory like...
- Oh, so what, you MJ now?

28:39.884 --> 28:43.513
- Bro, I'm talking '96 Bulls!
- Now, who's living in denial?

28:45.098 --> 28:47.100
Filthy, I'm talking about us, all right?

28:47.934 --> 28:48.977
Me and you.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.939
- If we lose to Lakeside...
- Win or lose,

28:52.939 --> 28:57.152
we go hard, together man.
Just like we always have.

28:59.028 --> 29:00.572
And always will.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.658
We got this. Hey, come here, y'all!

29:03.825 --> 29:06.536
- Hey, come here, gather around.
- Hey, put your hands in right now.

29:08.204 --> 29:11.791
Listen, we got this. So let's rock this!

29:11.958 --> 29:16.254
We got this! Let's rock this!
We got this! Let's rock this!

29:21.801 --> 29:23.720
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

29:24.345 --> 29:25.972
D him up. D up!

29:27.682 --> 29:30.310
Come on! Yeah!

29:30.310 --> 29:31.895
Run it, bring it up.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.992
Go on and dance, I ain't mad at you!

29:47.911 --> 29:50.705
- Whoo!
- Sit down.

30:00.048 --> 30:00.924
Let's go!

30:04.385 --> 30:07.180
<i>The game is fluid, it becomes instinct.</i>

30:09.766 --> 30:16.064
<i>You acclimate, you adapt, you overcome,
a smooth pivot, a sick double cross.</i>

30:19.192 --> 30:20.527
- Hey!

30:20.527 --> 30:23.112
- Oh!
- Hey! Bro! What you doing

30:23.112 --> 30:26.324
- all that for man? Chill out!
- Get up man. Hey, you all right?

30:32.580 --> 30:33.748
You got it, come on.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.836
You got this, bro, all right?

30:40.088 --> 30:42.507
Call the shots.
It's all you.

30:49.013 --> 30:51.266
Game on the line, kid. Don't brick it.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.278
<i>We dreamt
of becoming GOATs together</i>

31:03.570 --> 31:04.863
<i>and we did.</i>

31:05.488 --> 31:08.366
<i>We just never knew
who would be on the court in the end.</i>

31:15.415 --> 31:16.916
<i>You draw up a game plan...</i>

31:19.711 --> 31:21.087
<i>but once the ball tips-off...</i>

31:26.426 --> 31:29.262
<i>...all those Xs and Os
go right out the window.</i>

31:34.601 --> 31:35.935
<i>No matter what happens...</i>

31:35.935 --> 31:37.478
- That's okay, Josh.
- That's okay.

31:37.604 --> 31:38.980
It's okay, you got it.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.361
<i>...you do
what it takes to win.</i>

31:46.154 --> 31:47.322
Let's go!

31:48.239 --> 31:49.365
You and me.

31:49.365 --> 31:50.867
<i>In the game.</i>

31:57.290 --> 31:58.416
<i>And in life.</i>

32:14.724 --> 32:15.934
Great game.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.602
Nice job, Zuma.
- Thank you.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.145
I wanna invite you
to my select summer camp.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.605
- You for real?
- Yeah.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.899
- All right, I'm gonna text you, Coach.
- Yeah.

32:26.486 --> 32:28.071
I hope that L hurt, Filthy.

32:28.738 --> 32:31.407
Not as much as it'll hurt
when we win that championship, Zuma.

32:31.658 --> 32:34.452
- All right. We're gonna see.
- We'll see.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.330
Good game out there.

32:38.247 --> 32:41.084
Uh, thanks. But we lost.

32:41.417 --> 32:45.505
You persevered, and you adapted.
That's what I want at Beacon. You too, JB.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.840
Keep shooting. I'll be watching.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.218
Thank you.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.638
Yo! We're all good.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.057
Thanks to you,
making up all that stupid stuff

32:56.057 --> 32:59.352
about making beats and cooking
for your passion proposal, man.

32:59.477 --> 33:03.231
- Good stuff!
- Actually, Filthy, it was true.

33:04.983 --> 33:05.984
All of it.

33:15.660 --> 33:16.828
- Hey!
- Hey.

33:16.953 --> 33:18.746
- Hey.
- Well done!

33:18.746 --> 33:20.373
- Thank you.
- You did great.

33:20.373 --> 33:23.001
- He was focused, strong comeback.
Mm-hmm.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.005
- Hey, see you at home, okay?
- See you.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.465
Filthy, Filthy!
You lost the game, but like, how...

33:29.465 --> 33:31.134
Look, it's not a good time, Maya.

33:31.134 --> 33:34.512
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.
But that second half of the game, Filthy.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.848
- You killed it, bro. You were on it!
- Okay, okay.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.433
Hey, guys. How y'all doin'?

33:38.558 --> 33:39.851
Hey, Alexis.
- Hey, Alexis.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.145
- Hey, Filthy. Oh, JB.
- Hey...

33:42.562 --> 33:44.605
What's up, Alexis?
- You didn't know?

33:45.189 --> 33:46.441
JB asked her to the dance.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.444
You good?

33:50.570 --> 33:52.572
<i>You think
things are going one way,</i>

33:52.780 --> 33:55.366
<i>but in the blink of an eye,
it changes direction.</i>

33:56.034 --> 33:58.870
<i>A quick shoulder shake, a slick eye fake.</i>

33:59.328 --> 34:01.706
<i>And just like that,
you're left off balance,</i>

34:01.998 --> 34:04.125
<i>trying to play
yourself back into position.</i>

34:04.667 --> 34:07.587
<i>As in, the crossover.</i>
