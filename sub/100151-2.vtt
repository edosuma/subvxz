I would offer you a job as a bouncer.

20:36.236 --> 20:40.073
‐ I mean, I wish I worked here.
This place is way more my style.

20:40.073 --> 20:43.660
‐ Okay, this is incredible.
I haven't channel surfed since 2006.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.954
I mean, I quit paying for cable,
like, forever ago.

20:46.538 --> 20:49.625
[gasps] Drag Race is on? Wait, okay,

20:49.625 --> 20:53.337
can I just, like, come here on Fridays
and watch RuPaul live?

20:53.337 --> 20:56.089
‐ Until it's a dog nail salon, sure.
IZZY: Oh my god,

20:56.089 --> 20:57.883
I cannot believe that guys

20:57.883 --> 21:00.010
just get to show up at a bar

21:00.010 --> 21:02.638
and watch sports for free,
like, whenever they want to.

21:02.638 --> 21:04.181
This is genius.

21:06.975 --> 21:09.770
‐ Have you ever thought about renovating
this place instead of selling it?

21:09.770 --> 21:12.439
‐ Yeah, I don't think a new coat
of paint is gonna save this place.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.441
‐ Not just a coat of paint. I mean, like,

21:14.441 --> 21:16.777
a whole new concept.

21:16.777 --> 21:19.488
A bar with no meth Santas,

21:19.488 --> 21:21.240
clean bathrooms,

21:21.240 --> 21:22.741
rosé on tap.

21:22.741 --> 21:26.036
You know, somewhere where you can
go where you're not getting hit on.

21:26.036 --> 21:28.288
Somewhere where you can yell at the TV

21:28.288 --> 21:30.707
while watching Bravo or The Bachelor.

21:31.834 --> 21:33.585
‐ Uh, I don't know what you
guys are talking about,

21:33.585 --> 21:35.546
but I just heard the words
rosé and Bachelor

21:35.546 --> 21:38.465
in the same sentence,
so yes to whatever that's for.

21:39.925 --> 21:41.176
‐ Hm. [laughs]

21:42.469 --> 21:44.763
Wait, are you serious?
‐ Yeah.

21:44.763 --> 21:47.558
I‐I don't care if a dumb bank internship

21:47.558 --> 21:50.102
is what people think is
the big get. I hate it.

21:50.102 --> 21:52.896
I went to business school
to become an entrepreneur.

21:53.438 --> 21:55.440
And this could be my summer internship.

21:56.525 --> 21:58.819
I mean, we could do it together.

22:00.445 --> 22:03.115
‐ Hm. I mean,

22:03.115 --> 22:05.951
it would really, really
piss off my dead dad.

22:06.994 --> 22:09.788
Telling him I was gay was good,
but this might top that.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.375
