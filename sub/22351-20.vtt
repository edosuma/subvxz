00:01.990 --> 00:03.410
>> Julie: For weeks Shelly
and Clay have-- Shelli and

00:03.410 --> 00:04.990
Clay have been picking off
the other side of the house

00:04.990 --> 00:08.540
one by one.

00:08.540 --> 00:11.950
Now the hunters have become
the hunted.

00:11.950 --> 00:13.990
Welcome to "Big Brother".

00:13.990 --> 00:21.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> So far this summer on

00:21.990 --> 00:25.990
"Big Brother": There's been
romance.

00:25.990 --> 00:28.700
>> You're to the going
anywhere.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.990
>> Unrequieted love.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.990
>> Austin an I are besties
but I don't see him in a

00:33.990 --> 00:34.990
romantic loot.

00:34.990 --> 00:42.990
>> Insane challenges.

00:42.990 --> 00:45.990
And explosive fights.

00:45.990 --> 00:48.990
>> All the mistrust in this
whole house has all been

00:48.990 --> 00:49.990
planted by you.

00:49.990 --> 00:52.990
>> It has hit the fan,
point-blank and period.

00:52.990 --> 00:54.990
>> Why are we under the
covers here.

00:54.990 --> 00:57.990
>> Out of the chaos a power
alliance is formed.

00:57.990 --> 01:03.990
>> This could be called Clay
and "the sixth sense".

01:03.990 --> 01:09.990
>> Nd they eliminated some
of their biggest threats.

01:09.990 --> 01:13.990
>> Davonne, Audrey, Jason,
you are evicted from the big

01:13.990 --> 01:14.990
brother house.

01:14.990 --> 01:17.990
>> "The sixth sense" was
primed to dominate for the

01:17.990 --> 01:18.290
summer.

01:18.290 --> 01:19.830
>> They have no idea.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.990
>> "The sixth sense" is
coming to fruition.

01:21.990 --> 01:25.290
>> But after an epic battle
of endurance.

01:25.290 --> 01:27.990
>> Congratulations James,
you are the new head of

01:27.990 --> 01:27.990
household.

01:27.990 --> 01:29.990
>> The underdogs took
control.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.990
>> Definitely not afraid to
get any blood on my hands.

01:32.990 --> 01:35.990
I'm going for dig --
>> and James set his sights

01:35.990 --> 01:37.990
on the show-mance.

01:37.990 --> 01:40.990
>> I nominated you, Clay,
and you Shelli.

01:40.990 --> 01:43.990
At the veto competition it
was do or do for the love

01:43.990 --> 01:44.990
birds.

01:44.990 --> 01:46.990
>> I've got to win or Clay
has got to win.

01:46.990 --> 01:49.290
This is about our life in
this game.

01:49.290 --> 01:53.990
>> But king James became
ruler of the golden veto.

01:53.990 --> 01:56.700
>> I got so much right now,
I got the hoh key.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.990
I got my power of veto
medallion right now.

01:59.990 --> 02:02.990
I'm definitely feeling like
a rap star.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.990
>> In a last-ditch effort to
save the couple.

02:05.990 --> 02:08.990
>> I have information I can
give James and hopefully

02:08.990 --> 02:11.990
this information will help
sway James.

02:11.990 --> 02:14.990
>> Shelli threw her alliance
member Austin under the bus.

02:14.990 --> 02:18.990
>> Austin might be making
that promise.

02:18.990 --> 02:21.990
But juddas isn't making that
promise because juddas mate

02:21.990 --> 02:22.990
turn on Austin.

02:22.990 --> 02:25.990
>> Have you been under any
narcotics, medicine or

02:25.990 --> 02:26.950
anything?

02:26.950 --> 02:28.990
>> But at the veto meeting.

02:28.990 --> 02:31.120
>> I just don't think that
we deserve to be in this

02:31.120 --> 02:31.990
position right now.

02:31.990 --> 02:33.950
That's all I can say.

02:33.950 --> 02:37.990
>> It became official that
clelli would be torn apart.

02:37.990 --> 02:40.990
>> I have decided not to use
the power of veto.

02:40.990 --> 02:45.000
>> Tonight, will it be Clay
or Shelli leaving the house?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.990
Plus the hitmen are back.

02:47.990 --> 02:48.990
>> Let's be honest.

02:48.990 --> 02:50.120
The shirts are coming off at
some point.

02:50.120 --> 02:50.990
>> They have to.

02:50.990 --> 02:53.000
>> And a new battle for
power begins.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.990
All this live on "big
brother".

02:59.990 --> 03:37.990
>> Are you-- runk in income,
baby, maybe?

03:37.990 --> 03:43.990
>>
(Cheers and applause)

03:43.990 --> 03:46.700
>> Julie: Good evening, I'm
Julie chen, welcome to

03:46.700 --> 03:46.990
"Big Brother".

03:46.990 --> 03:50.990
Last week the power shifted
as James became head of

03:50.990 --> 03:53.990
household by outlasting each
and every member of "the

03:53.990 --> 03:56.950
sixth sense" alliance.

03:56.950 --> 03:59.990
With the the power in his
hands, he didn't hold back

03:59.990 --> 04:02.990
going right after the
dominant couple in the

04:02.990 --> 04:02.990
house.

04:02.990 --> 04:06.290
And when he won the power of
veto, he stood his ground

04:06.290 --> 04:08.990
leaving them in place.

04:08.990 --> 04:12.990
Now either Clay or Shelli
will pay the ultimate price.

04:12.990 --> 04:16.990
The only question is which
one will be left to fight on

04:16.990 --> 04:17.990
alone.

04:17.990 --> 04:19.120
We'll find out shortly.

04:19.120 --> 04:24.990
But first, choosing love
over a half-million dollars,

04:24.990 --> 04:27.830
clelli has promised not to
campaign against each other

04:27.830 --> 04:40.120
leaving their fate in the
hands of their alliance.

04:40.120 --> 04:40.990
>> .

04:40.990 --> 04:43.990
>> James not using the veto,
that's fine.

04:43.990 --> 04:45.990
Kick a dog when it's down.

04:45.990 --> 04:49.990
>> There's not a stronger
bond in this house as far as

04:49.990 --> 04:53.990
loyalty and trust that me
and Shelli have.

04:53.990 --> 04:56.990
So there's no way in hell
that I can-- campaign

04:56.990 --> 05:00.990
against this girl.

05:00.990 --> 05:04.990
>> Just stay friends with
me.

05:04.990 --> 05:06.990
>> Awkwardness begins.

05:06.990 --> 05:10.990
And I'm feeling glad that
it's just not me up there.

05:10.990 --> 05:13.990
There is two pairs in this
house.

05:13.990 --> 05:19.990
It's Clay an Shelli and me
and julio, so if one pair

05:19.990 --> 05:24.990
has to go up I'm glad it's
them and not us.

05:24.990 --> 05:27.990
>> Veto is power, man.

05:27.990 --> 05:29.700
It's power.

05:29.700 --> 05:30.990
>> Shelli's definitely the
target.

05:30.990 --> 05:34.990
I'm very confi didn't that
my team are all about

05:34.990 --> 05:35.950
getting Shelli out.

05:35.950 --> 05:35.990
I put in a lot of footwork
this week and I hope they

05:35.990 --> 05:36.990
complete the mission an stay
true to the game.

05:36.990 --> 05:38.990
>> Allots of emotions behind
it.

05:38.990 --> 05:38.990
>> Uh-huh.

05:38.990 --> 05:46.990
I hear you.

05:46.990 --> 05:51.990
>> We have four days left.

05:51.990 --> 06:02.120
So let's just make them good.

06:02.120 --> 06:08.990
>> I'm going to miss you so
much.

06:08.990 --> 06:10.120
>> I feel terrible right
now.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.990
Like I really do care about
both Shelli and Clay.

06:12.990 --> 06:15.120
And I can't imagine how they
must feel.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.990
But this is a critical
moment in the game.

06:16.990 --> 06:18.990
My personal preference is to
keep Shelli.

06:18.990 --> 06:21.990
I think our alliance has the
best shot at sticking

06:21.990 --> 06:27.990
together if Shelli is the
remaining member.

06:27.990 --> 06:31.830
>> Whatever I had to do to
save myself in this game, I

06:31.830 --> 06:33.990
guess I'm going to have to
do it.

06:33.990 --> 06:37.990
But pie God I'm not going to
do it in a way that would

06:37.990 --> 06:50.990
hurt him.

06:50.990 --> 06:51.990
>> Hey, man.

06:51.990 --> 06:55.120
Honestly shell and Clay toll
me a lot of things last

06:55.120 --> 06:55.990
night.

06:55.990 --> 06:56.990
>> Yeah?

06:56.990 --> 06:59.990
>> Just all kind of stuff.

06:59.990 --> 07:01.990
Dating back from Audrey.

07:01.990 --> 07:03.990
They said that you
were-- the juddas character

07:03.990 --> 07:06.990
was voting crazy.

07:06.990 --> 07:10.990
The thing is with me is like
the whole target thing,

07:10.990 --> 07:15.990
putting me up with Liz or
whatever it was was hoh.

07:15.990 --> 07:17.990
>> You were never a target
though really.

07:17.990 --> 07:18.990
>> They didn't say that.

07:18.990 --> 07:20.990
They were just saying that
pretty much you told Liz to

07:20.990 --> 07:23.990
put me up at the last minute
during the hoh thing.

07:23.990 --> 07:24.990
>> That's not true at all.

07:24.990 --> 07:26.990
That's absolutely not true.

07:26.990 --> 07:28.990
>> I did everything I could
this week to help Clay and

07:28.990 --> 07:29.990
Shelli.

07:29.990 --> 07:31.990
Why are they blowing up my
game?

07:31.990 --> 07:33.990
Is nothing sacred in this
house?

07:33.990 --> 07:35.990
This was a classless move.

07:35.990 --> 07:38.830
>> Me, I had nothing against
you at all.

07:38.830 --> 07:42.990
I just hope we are both on
the same page.

07:42.990 --> 07:44.990
>> Me and the girls are both
on your side, 100 percent on

07:44.990 --> 07:44.990
this.

07:44.990 --> 07:47.990
>> I don't know how these
next couple of days are

07:47.990 --> 07:53.990
going to go.

07:53.990 --> 07:54.990
>> I want to talk to you.

07:54.990 --> 07:58.120
>> I want to talk to you
guys too.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.990
>> He pulled me aside and
said Clay and Shelli came up

08:01.990 --> 08:03.990
and said a lot of stuff to
him.

08:03.990 --> 08:07.990
Alliances that they had with
us being you, physically.

08:07.990 --> 08:10.990
>> He never asked me to
confirm or deny, just that

08:10.990 --> 08:12.990
he didn't care if it was
true or not but that he

08:12.990 --> 08:15.990
hoped we could work together
going forward.

08:15.990 --> 08:19.990
>> I don't know no, of what
they actually told him.

08:19.990 --> 08:21.990
>> James didn't actually say
that Clay and Shelli told

08:21.990 --> 08:24.990
him about our alliance but I
wasn't asking to be

08:24.990 --> 08:26.990
protected in this game and I
need to let her know how

08:26.990 --> 08:29.990
Clay and Shelli have done us
wrong in this last hour of

08:29.990 --> 08:30.540
defense.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.990
We need to be as tight as
possible if we're going to

08:32.990 --> 08:34.830
stick together in this game.

08:34.830 --> 08:37.830
>> This is so stupid.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.990
>> The biggest shame ever.

08:39.990 --> 08:41.990
They just know too much.

08:41.990 --> 08:44.700
Let me tell you how
personally I take that.

08:44.700 --> 08:56.990
Like no, who-- is all I can
say.

08:56.990 --> 08:59.990
>> I'm pissed and
disappointed that Shelli and

08:59.990 --> 09:02.990
Clay sold "the sixth sense"
out to James but as I watch

09:02.990 --> 09:05.990
the pieces of sixth sense
crumbling around here, I

09:05.990 --> 09:08.990
realize right now priority
number one is to mends

09:08.990 --> 09:10.990
fences so my own game
doesn't go down the drain

09:10.990 --> 09:16.990
this week.

09:16.990 --> 09:17.990
>> Do they know?

09:17.990 --> 09:18.990
>> James told them.

09:18.990 --> 09:19.990
>> Yeah.

09:19.990 --> 09:23.990
>> They said do you know
that Clay an-- told him all

09:23.990 --> 09:27.990
kinds of-- things that there
was an alliance.

09:27.990 --> 09:30.990
That you told him of our
alliance.

09:30.990 --> 09:31.990
>> No, we did not.

09:31.990 --> 09:33.990
>> That is what he is
implying.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.540
>> Clay and I definitely did
not say that.

09:35.540 --> 09:35.990
>> Okay, well.

09:35.990 --> 09:40.410
>> I said that-- changed the
nomination at the last

09:40.410 --> 09:45.990
minute to put James up.

09:45.990 --> 09:51.000
Obviously I did not want to
campaign against Clay but if

09:51.000 --> 09:53.990
I'm on y'all's side I'm a
better player.

09:53.990 --> 09:58.950
I am a better strategic
thinker.

09:58.950 --> 10:00.990
>> I will do it for you,
don't do it, it will make

10:00.990 --> 10:01.990
you look terrible.

10:01.990 --> 10:02.990
>> I'm lacking out for you.

10:02.990 --> 10:08.990
>> Thank you, I owe you.

10:08.990 --> 10:16.990
>> I just realized,-- touche.

10:16.990 --> 10:16.990
>> What's up?

10:16.990 --> 10:18.990
>> Huh.

10:18.990 --> 10:21.990
>> I need to clear the air
with "the sixth sense"

10:21.990 --> 10:21.990
alliance.

10:21.990 --> 10:24.990
I went against them and
threw Austin under the bus.

10:24.990 --> 10:27.990
I definitely want to make
sure I mend these fences

10:27.990 --> 10:30.700
because the six sense is the
group of people I want to

10:30.700 --> 10:32.540
move forward with this this
game.

10:32.540 --> 10:34.990
>> Obviously we heart
that-- we're kind of hurt by

10:34.990 --> 10:35.000
it.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.990
>> James totally backed me
up against the wall.

10:38.990 --> 10:42.990
>> Just do an-- with the
back against wall.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.990
>> I fell for it hook, line
and sinker.

10:44.990 --> 10:47.410
>> You have numbers on your
side, why what you try to

10:47.410 --> 10:47.990
jeopardize it.

10:47.990 --> 10:49.410
>> They totally played me.

10:49.410 --> 10:52.990
I'm like shoot, now it's him
under the bus and hurt his

10:52.990 --> 10:52.990
game.

10:52.990 --> 10:56.990
You guys have to understand
that like I'm totally owning

10:56.990 --> 10:58.990
up when I do something wrong,
okay.

10:58.990 --> 10:59.990
>> I know.

10:59.990 --> 10:59.990
>> Sorry.

10:59.990 --> 11:01.990
>> Okay, well, it is what it
is.

11:01.990 --> 11:05.120
>> Look, I'm not happy that
Shelli tried to blow my game

11:05.120 --> 11:06.990
up to James at the last
minute.

11:06.990 --> 11:11.990
However, I'm to the going to
ruin the sixth sense

11:11.990 --> 11:12.990
alliance over something
small.

11:12.990 --> 11:14.990
>> We do have a long history
of working together all of

11:14.990 --> 11:17.990
us, which hate to throw it
out and make James game for

11:17.990 --> 11:18.990
him.

11:18.990 --> 11:19.990
>> Exactly, why do that.

11:19.990 --> 11:21.990
>> This may be a moment of
crisis for sixth sense, if

11:21.990 --> 11:25.990
we are able to let bygones
be bygones we could be

11:25.990 --> 11:27.990
stronger than ever and the
five us could continue to

11:27.990 --> 11:29.990
operate as a really strong
alliance.

11:29.990 --> 11:30.990
>> We're going to be even
closer and stronger and move

11:30.990 --> 11:31.990
forward.

11:31.990 --> 11:33.990
That's what you have to do
in this game.

11:33.990 --> 11:36.990
>> You save my ass I will
never forget what you did.

11:36.990 --> 11:38.990
>> I love you guys, like are
you kidding me.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.990
>> If "the sixth sense"
alliance is still on my side

11:40.990 --> 11:43.990
and both to keep me this
week, that means that I

11:43.990 --> 11:49.990
might be the one who is
savedness tonight the power

11:49.990 --> 11:51.410
couple will be split apart.

11:51.410 --> 11:54.990
But up next we'll check in
with last season's power

11:54.990 --> 11:58.540
couple, the hitmen who
secretly dominated the game

11:58.540 --> 12:00.990
and made it all the way to
the end.

12:00.990 --> 12:04.990
Last week we asked you to
sound off for the house

12:04.990 --> 12:05.990
guest you're rooting for.

12:05.990 --> 12:07.990
Well, your videos poured in.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.990
An here's what you had to
say.

12:09.990 --> 12:13.290
>> I am rooting for Meg to
win "Big Brother" 17 because

12:13.290 --> 12:16.990
she's hilarious but also
vengeful an her hands are

12:16.990 --> 12:17.990
bloodless.

12:17.990 --> 12:20.120
She's really to take out
Shelli and Clay while flying

12:20.120 --> 12:21.990
right under their radar.

12:21.990 --> 12:23.990
>> We love Johnnie Mac.

12:23.990 --> 12:25.990
We think he's funny and
playing with heart and we

12:25.990 --> 12:28.410
want to see him step out of
the shadows and take control

12:28.410 --> 12:28.990
this we can.

12:28.990 --> 12:31.990
>> You, Jack-year, I'm
rooting you, girl, a fire

12:31.990 --> 12:32.990
has been lit.

12:32.990 --> 12:37.990
I see you-- everybody left
and right, figure things out,

12:37.990 --> 12:38.990
honey win that to the bank
am I'm cheering for you.

12:38.990 --> 12:39.990
Make it happen.
Work.

13:00.830 --> 13:04.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Welcome back to

13:04.990 --> 13:06.410
"Big Brother".

13:06.410 --> 13:08.990
The sixth sense alliance is
intent on keeping Shelli in

13:08.990 --> 13:12.990
the game but betraying the h,
h is a move that could start

13:12.990 --> 13:20.990
a war with James and his
allies.

13:20.990 --> 13:22.990
>> Honesty is always the
best policy.

13:22.990 --> 13:23.990
>> Huh-uh.

13:23.990 --> 13:24.990
Lying is the best policy.

13:24.990 --> 13:28.990
>> I get more mad about a
lie than about what the lie

13:28.990 --> 13:29.540
is.

13:29.540 --> 13:31.990
>> Oh, yes.

13:31.990 --> 13:34.700
>> Yeah.

13:34.700 --> 13:35.830
>> An then there were two.

13:35.830 --> 13:36.990
>> And then there were two.

13:36.990 --> 13:44.990
>> Whoa.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.990
>> Clay and I have been
together 24/7 for six weeks

13:48.990 --> 13:50.990
now.

13:50.990 --> 13:54.990
Whether I stay or Clay stays,
we definitely want to

13:54.990 --> 14:11.990
continue this relationship
outside of the house.

14:11.990 --> 14:16.540
Is so I guess out of all
nights this was the night

14:16.540 --> 14:21.990
that it was time to seal
that promise with a kiss.

14:21.990 --> 14:39.990
It was definitely worth the
wait

14:39.990 --> 14:43.990
.

14:43.990 --> 14:46.990
>> Did she see us?

14:46.990 --> 14:50.990
>>.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.000
>> Does everybody in this
room kind of have a feeling

14:53.000 --> 14:54.990
of knowing where they are
voting tomorrow.

14:54.990 --> 14:57.990
Is everybody kind of
like-- or still up in the

14:57.990 --> 14:57.990
air?

14:57.990 --> 15:00.990
>> I mean really the only
thing I ask is that we get

15:00.990 --> 15:02.990
Shelli out.

15:02.990 --> 15:04.990
>> You know I'm on board
with you.

15:04.990 --> 15:06.990
I just want to make sure
because I have all of these

15:06.990 --> 15:08.990
concerns and we should be
able to talk about all of

15:08.990 --> 15:08.990
this.

15:08.990 --> 15:10.120
Have it all out.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.990
>> It's important that James
thinks we're all on the same

15:12.990 --> 15:16.990
page but we campaigned to
James right now to keep

15:16.990 --> 15:17.120
Shelli over Clay.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.990
>> I mean look, I have to
insurance my own survival

15:19.990 --> 15:20.990
above all else.

15:20.990 --> 15:24.990
But if we stick together t
doesn't matter.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.540
>> Gamewise Shelli say
bigger threat than Clay.

15:26.540 --> 15:28.950
>> I will say I'm equally
close to both.

15:28.950 --> 15:29.540
>> We are two.

15:29.540 --> 15:32.990
>> I think that-- we just
have to agree who we are

15:32.990 --> 15:33.700
voting for this week.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.990
>> I don't think it really
matters, if the target is

15:35.990 --> 15:35.990
the other one.

15:35.990 --> 15:37.990
>> If the target is the
other one, it doesn't

15:37.990 --> 15:38.700
matter.

15:38.700 --> 15:43.990
>> There is nothing more
wrathful than the scorn full

15:43.990 --> 15:45.290
of a woman.

15:45.290 --> 15:45.990
>> Ooh.

15:45.990 --> 15:46.990
>> Trust me, I know.

15:46.990 --> 15:49.540
You piss a woman off t is
more reasonable to reason

15:49.540 --> 15:52.990
with a guy than a woman.

15:52.990 --> 15:55.290
>> I would hate for people
to put pressure to do

15:55.290 --> 15:56.990
something that is not best
for them.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.990
>> Obviously Shelli wants to
be here to fight to win.

15:59.990 --> 16:02.000
If Clay wants to go home,
obviously he wants to go

16:02.000 --> 16:04.990
home this week, send his ass
home next week.

16:04.990 --> 16:05.990
That's one mohr week.

16:05.990 --> 16:08.990
>> Clay wants to keep Shelli
here because she's going to

16:08.990 --> 16:09.990
win the game, not him.

16:09.990 --> 16:10.990
>> Exactly.

16:10.990 --> 16:14.990
Like if someone doesn't want
to be here, then it's easier.

16:14.990 --> 16:16.990
>> But for me, why would I
ever want to keep the person

16:16.990 --> 16:18.990
that is fighting so hard to
be here.

16:18.990 --> 16:21.950
>> Then you don't liked
argument of keeping the

16:21.950 --> 16:23.990
bigger target in the game
which say bigger shield for

16:23.990 --> 16:23.990
everyone.

16:23.990 --> 16:26.990
>> Wait a minute.

16:26.990 --> 16:30.990
Mean you played in order for
Shelli to go home.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.990
>> I saw Shelli more of a
threat than Clay.

16:32.990 --> 16:33.990
>> Right.

16:33.990 --> 16:35.990
>> I have been questioning
Vanessa and her game for a

16:35.990 --> 16:36.990
while now.

16:36.990 --> 16:41.990
She already dropped the ball
with me when she sent Jesse

16:41.990 --> 16:45.990
home ran done-- randomly,
she isn't home jayson, if

16:45.990 --> 16:48.120
she wants Shelli to stay
this week, that means she is

16:48.120 --> 17:00.000
not planning on sending
Shelli home at all.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.700
>>> She just worried about
the house being pissed at

17:04.700 --> 17:05.990
her.

17:05.990 --> 17:06.990
>> Did you see how she like
questioned it so hard.

17:06.990 --> 17:08.830
She's planning on something.

17:08.830 --> 17:13.990
She was trying to like
persuade us to keep her

17:13.990 --> 17:15.990
something's up.

17:15.990 --> 17:17.990
>> Oh so, she was talking to
you like she wanted Clay to

17:17.990 --> 17:20.990
go home first and then
Shelli.

17:20.990 --> 17:21.990
>> That's what she is saying
right now.

17:21.990 --> 17:23.990
>> Oh, I got you.

17:23.990 --> 17:26.290
I'm going to be pissed if
Shelli stays.

17:26.290 --> 17:29.290
>> But then Austin was kind
of teetering on it too.

17:29.290 --> 17:30.120
I don't like that.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.990
Either way, like, I'm not
depending on Vanessa to keep

17:33.990 --> 17:35.990
me safe, Austin to keep me
safe.

17:35.990 --> 17:36.990
You know what I mean?

17:36.990 --> 17:38.000
She has to go.

17:38.000 --> 17:38.990
>> Yeah.

17:38.990 --> 17:41.990
>> Then we can't trust them
if they're not going to vote

17:41.990 --> 17:42.290
her out.

17:42.290 --> 17:45.990
>> I'm feeling like this is
deja vu, I don't see why

17:45.990 --> 17:48.990
Vanessa wouldn't pull a fast
one on us and screw us

17:48.990 --> 17:48.990
again.

17:48.990 --> 17:52.990
And if she does, this girl
is definitely going to

17:52.990 --> 17:52.990
battle.

17:52.990 --> 17:55.990
It is time for war.

17:55.990 --> 17:58.990
>> That's the worst-case
scenario, Shelli stays.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.540
>> Worst case Shelli stays
and we have nobody to trust

18:01.540 --> 18:01.990
now.

18:01.990 --> 18:20.990
>> This whole week was a
waste.

18:20.990 --> 18:34.990
>> I feel like I cannot
stand Clay.

18:34.990 --> 18:39.990
>> We have an tant in this
game to play it right now.

18:39.990 --> 18:45.990
But Shelli is a really good
player.

18:45.990 --> 18:49.990
>> It's not about-- we have
to do what is best for our

18:49.990 --> 18:50.990
game.

18:50.990 --> 18:51.990
>> For sure.

18:51.990 --> 18:54.830
>> Would you have
been-- patching.

18:54.830 --> 19:02.950
>> I know.

19:02.950 --> 19:04.990
>> My brain is keeps going.

19:04.990 --> 19:12.990
>> What dow mean.

19:12.990 --> 19:16.990
>>> Okay this is the part,
Shelli is a really strong

19:16.990 --> 19:17.990
player.

19:17.990 --> 19:22.990
Why not get the strong
player out.

19:22.990 --> 19:25.990
>> In some way she did this
week.

19:25.990 --> 19:29.290
She fell sold all of us out
to save her and Clay and

19:29.290 --> 19:31.540
then sold me out in her last
hour.

19:31.540 --> 19:34.990
Double sellout, two things
she didn't have to do.

19:34.990 --> 19:36.990
>> Like anything else t is
the deeper --

19:36.990 --> 19:40.990
>> there is risk in kepping
Shelli is I piss off James,

19:40.990 --> 19:42.990
Meg and jackiest and why
rock the boat this week.

19:42.990 --> 19:44.990
I don't know what to do.

19:44.990 --> 19:45.410
I'm torn.

19:45.410 --> 19:47.700
I could flip a coin at this
point.

19:47.700 --> 19:48.990
It's 50/50.

19:48.990 --> 19:51.540
>> There's a million and one
scenarios.

19:51.540 --> 19:57.990
It's gambling.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.990
>> Julie: This summer no
secret has been safe, as

20:00.990 --> 20:02.990
loose lips have sunk many
ships.

20:02.990 --> 20:07.990
But last season the hitmen
secretly dominated the game.

20:07.990 --> 20:10.990
So what do Derek and Cody
think about this season's

20:10.990 --> 20:13.990
game play?

20:13.990 --> 20:15.990
>> There's Cody, money.

20:15.990 --> 20:16.990
>> Koddy's coming.

20:16.990 --> 20:18.990
>> I'm Derek and I won big
brother 16.

20:18.990 --> 20:21.990
After the show ended, a lot
of things have changed but I

20:21.990 --> 20:24.950
think the biggest thing is
my attention to family and

20:24.950 --> 20:27.990
making time for those things.

20:27.990 --> 20:28.990
>> What is up, brother.

20:28.990 --> 20:31.990
>> I'm Cody from Big Brother
16.

20:31.990 --> 20:33.990
I am the runner-up in the
season.

20:33.990 --> 20:34.990
>> What's up.

20:34.990 --> 20:35.990
>> How are you?

20:35.990 --> 20:36.990
>> Hey.

20:36.990 --> 20:38.990
>> Der secretary not just
part of the hitmen alliance,

20:38.990 --> 20:39.990
he's really like my brother
now.

20:39.990 --> 20:44.540
>> How is it going.

20:44.540 --> 20:47.540
>> Cody and I see each other
at least once a month and we

20:47.540 --> 20:49.990
have the opportunity to
probably talk almost every

20:49.990 --> 20:50.540
day.

20:50.540 --> 20:54.120
>> Looking good.

20:54.120 --> 20:54.990
>> This brings me back a
little bit.

20:54.990 --> 20:57.540
Coming off the show, my
favorite aspect is we could

20:57.540 --> 20:59.990
talk all the time and not
have to talk Big Brother.

20:59.990 --> 21:01.990
I know it's a true bond.

21:01.990 --> 21:01.990
Absolutely.

21:01.990 --> 21:04.290
When I burn my face off on
this grill you're going to

21:04.290 --> 21:04.990
drive me.

21:04.990 --> 21:08.990
>> When I need a new shirt
you have to buy me another

21:08.990 --> 21:09.990
one.

21:09.990 --> 21:12.950
Let's be honest, the shirt
is coming off at some point.

21:12.950 --> 21:13.990
>> Being a police officer
people have recognized me

21:13.990 --> 21:16.700
and take a something to
point out hey, are you on

21:16.700 --> 21:16.990
Big Brother.

21:16.990 --> 21:20.700
Getting the money, we did
splurge a little bit.

21:20.700 --> 21:23.990
I expect-- I did the number
one priority which was to

21:23.990 --> 21:27.990
get a tuition fund started
for tenly.

21:27.990 --> 21:28.990
>> What are you going to do.

21:28.990 --> 21:31.120
>> Aren't you doing like the
hot cops calendar.

21:31.120 --> 21:31.990
>> To doubt.

21:31.990 --> 21:32.990
>> With shirts off.

21:32.990 --> 21:32.990
>> No doubt.

21:32.990 --> 21:34.990
>> Good things happen to
good people.

21:34.990 --> 21:36.990
Look at you.

21:36.990 --> 21:38.990
>> Muscle, mens fitness.

21:38.990 --> 21:40.950
Big Brother is done.

21:40.950 --> 21:41.990
Jumped right into modeling.

21:41.990 --> 21:44.990
A lot of exciting stuff.

21:44.990 --> 21:45.990
>> I love the way we play
together.

21:45.990 --> 21:46.990
I loved what we did.

21:46.990 --> 21:49.990
Even though when I would
play down, I wouldn't be

21:49.990 --> 21:52.540
able to-- that is what it
really comes down to.

21:52.540 --> 21:53.990
>> My dude.

21:53.990 --> 21:56.290
>> Starting on day two, got
to make it to the final two.

21:56.290 --> 21:59.990
You know I love you.

21:59.990 --> 22:02.990
>> Yeah, it would have been
nice to win 500 k.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.950
Absolutely it would have
been okay.

22:04.950 --> 22:04.990
>> Congratulations.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.990
You are the winner of big
"Big Brother".

22:07.990 --> 22:11.700
(Cheers and applause)
>> What do you think about

22:11.700 --> 22:12.990
the season.

22:12.990 --> 22:13.990
>> James is taking care of
business.

22:13.990 --> 22:15.410
In that sixth week.

22:15.410 --> 22:16.990
Big moves sork proud of him.

22:16.990 --> 22:18.990
My favorite house guest say
toss up.

22:18.990 --> 22:21.990
I like Johnnie mack's style,
I like the way he is playing

22:21.990 --> 22:24.990
the game but I would be
lying if I didn't say I was

22:24.990 --> 22:25.410
rooting for James.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.990
>> How about the deal
between Shelli and James.

22:27.990 --> 22:29.540
>> That's what micks it the
best.

22:29.540 --> 22:31.990
>> I need your word, no
nominations, no back door

22:31.990 --> 22:33.000
for me or Clay, okay.

22:33.000 --> 22:33.990
>> I promise.

22:33.990 --> 22:35.990
Like it's classic big
brother.

22:35.990 --> 22:38.990
As far as our contract, we
had up there, it's up to my

22:38.990 --> 22:40.990
discretion whether that
contract is valid.

22:40.990 --> 22:42.990
And it's not up for appeal.

22:42.990 --> 22:43.120
>> A great move.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.990
He owes themming in.

22:44.990 --> 22:47.700
>> I like that James is not
afraid to make a big move.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.990
Putting the show-manse up on
the bloc, I like that a lot.

22:50.990 --> 22:53.000
I am surprised how willing
these guys are toive go up

22:53.000 --> 22:54.290
the game.

22:54.290 --> 22:57.990
Call ebb was willing to
volunteer to go on the block

22:57.990 --> 22:59.990
but he never said I will go
home.

22:59.990 --> 23:05.290
He is like vote me out, I
love her, I'm in love.

23:05.290 --> 23:07.990
>> You can't make me that
promise.

23:07.990 --> 23:10.830
>> Got it, one.

23:10.830 --> 23:12.990
>> It is getting really hot
out here.

23:12.990 --> 23:16.990
I don't want anyone compared
to the Clay.

23:16.990 --> 23:19.410
>> Sorry, Derek, I don't
mean to do this four.

23:19.410 --> 23:20.290
I'm on fire.

23:20.290 --> 23:21.990
>> Any smoke bombs.

23:21.990 --> 23:22.990
>> We're not talking about
smoke bombs.

23:22.990 --> 23:24.950
>> Yes, we are.

23:24.950 --> 23:24.990
>> Shelli looks good.

23:24.990 --> 23:26.990
Meg say cutie.

23:26.990 --> 23:29.990
>> Honestly, I con believe
that Becky got hit by a

23:29.990 --> 23:30.990
train.

23:30.990 --> 23:32.990
>> Becky looks good.

23:32.990 --> 23:34.120
She did.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.990
She got hit by a train and
lived through it.

23:36.990 --> 23:39.990
>> A train to the face and
still looks good.

23:39.990 --> 23:42.990
>> If the hitmen were in bb
17, how do you think this

23:42.990 --> 23:43.990
would go down?

23:43.990 --> 23:48.990
>> I honestly think we would
do just as well.

23:48.990 --> 23:51.990
>> The hitmen alliance is
definitely in my opinion one

23:51.990 --> 23:55.540
of the best ones to go down
in the history of the game.

23:55.540 --> 23:59.990
>> No one is standing a
chance.

23:59.990 --> 23:59.990
>> Mwah.

23:59.990 --> 24:02.990
>> Bye, love you guys.

24:02.990 --> 24:03.990
>> Hey, y'all.

24:03.990 --> 24:07.540
>> Coming up, Clay or Shelli
must say good-bye to the

24:07.540 --> 24:08.990
house and each other.

24:08.990 --> 24:12.410
One will go home and the
other will either make it to

24:12.410 --> 24:14.990
the jury or the final two
with the chance of win to
win it all.

24:14.990 --> 24:15.990
Stay with us.

24:21.990 --> 24:26.830
>>
(Cheers and applause)

24:26.830 --> 24:28.990
>> Julie: Welcome back to
"Big Brother".

24:28.990 --> 24:29.990
Clay or Shelli.

24:29.990 --> 24:33.290
They've been joined at the
hip since day one.

24:33.290 --> 24:35.990
But that's about to end as
one will stay in the game

24:35.990 --> 24:39.540
and the other will be going
home.

24:39.540 --> 24:43.990
Let's return to the living
room and begin the live vote.

24:43.990 --> 24:44.540
Hello, house guests.

24:44.540 --> 24:46.990
>> Oh, hi, Julie.

24:46.990 --> 24:49.990
>> Julie: It's time for the
live vote to begin.

24:49.990 --> 24:52.990
Clay, Shelli, in just
moments your housemates will

24:52.990 --> 24:54.990
cast their vote to evict
live.

24:54.990 --> 24:58.990
But before they do, you each
have a final chance to sway

24:58.990 --> 25:02.830
their votes with one brief
statement.

25:02.830 --> 25:02.990
Clay?

25:02.990 --> 25:05.990
You're first.

25:05.990 --> 25:08.990
>> First off, got to thank
the man upstairs for this

25:08.990 --> 25:09.700
opportunity.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.830
My family for the incredible
amount of support and love

25:12.830 --> 25:13.990
they've given me.

25:13.990 --> 25:16.120
My boy, my crew, always.

25:16.120 --> 25:19.990
It's been such a blessing to
spends the summer with all

25:19.990 --> 25:20.410
y'all.

25:20.410 --> 25:22.540
And y'all will hold a
special place in my heart.

25:22.540 --> 25:23.990
And I want y'all to know
that.

25:23.990 --> 25:28.830
As I know she holds a
completely, I'm already a

25:28.830 --> 25:31.120
winner here w that being
said, I'm asking y'all not

25:31.120 --> 25:35.410
to vote for me but to vote
for her to stay.

25:35.410 --> 25:40.990
>> Thank you, Clay, Shelli,
it's your turn.

25:40.990 --> 25:46.990
>> God, mom, dad, Lori,
kerry, weses and Lance, I

25:46.990 --> 25:48.950
love y'all so much.

25:48.950 --> 25:53.410
Clay, are you my heart every
minute of the past 50 days

25:53.410 --> 25:55.990
in this house you have been
my absolute rock.

25:55.990 --> 25:57.990
And I just can't wait to
live in the real world with

25:57.990 --> 25:58.990
you.

25:58.990 --> 26:00.990
We're going to have an
amazing experience together

26:00.990 --> 26:05.990
out in the outside world as
much as inside this world.

26:05.990 --> 26:08.990
To all of y'all, it's been
an absolute dream to be in

26:08.990 --> 26:11.990
this "Big Brother" house and
to have met and lived with

26:11.990 --> 26:12.990
all of y'all.

26:12.990 --> 26:15.990
I definitely pride myself on
playing a loyal and fair

26:15.990 --> 26:16.700
game.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.990
I am someone great to roll
with instead of rolling

26:19.990 --> 26:19.990
against.

26:19.990 --> 26:21.990
And that's it.

26:21.990 --> 26:21.990
>> .

26:21.990 --> 26:23.700
>> Julie: Thank you, Shelli,
thank you both.

26:23.700 --> 26:25.990
All right, everyone, it's
time for the live voting to

26:25.990 --> 26:26.990
begin.

26:26.990 --> 26:30.830
James,s ahead of household,
you're not allowed to vote.

26:30.830 --> 26:31.990
Neither are the two
nominees.

26:31.990 --> 26:34.990
One at a time, the rest of
you will enter the diary

26:34.990 --> 26:37.990
room and cast your vote to
evict.

26:37.990 --> 26:46.990
Vanessa, you're up first,
please go to the diary room.

26:46.990 --> 26:48.990
>> Julie: Vanessa originally
spearheaded the charge to

26:48.990 --> 26:49.990
keep Shelli in the house.

26:49.990 --> 26:52.990
But is that still her plan.

26:52.990 --> 26:54.990
>> Hi, Vanessa.

26:54.990 --> 26:55.990
>> Hey, Julie, love the
shades.

26:55.990 --> 26:56.990
>> Julie: Thank you.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.700
Please cast your vote to he
vick.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.990

Clay.

26:59.990 --> 27:03.950
>> Julie: Thank you.

27:03.950 --> 27:05.990
Meg clearly favors Clay.

27:05.990 --> 27:09.990
Will she take this
opportunity to vote out her

27:09.990 --> 27:10.990
competition?

27:10.990 --> 27:11.990
Hi, Meg.

27:11.990 --> 27:13.410
>> Hey, Julie.

27:13.410 --> 27:14.990
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

27:14.990 --> 27:15.990
>> Oh, man.

27:15.990 --> 27:19.540
I vote to edict Clay.

27:19.540 --> 27:21.990
>> Julie: Thank you.

27:21.990 --> 27:24.990
>> Thank you.

27:24.990 --> 27:25.990
>> Julie: Austin is
conflicted.

27:25.990 --> 27:29.540
He feels betrayed by Shelli
but sees the benefit of

27:29.540 --> 27:33.990
keeping her.

27:33.990 --> 27:33.990
Hi, Austin.

27:33.990 --> 27:34.990
>> Hello, Julie.

27:34.990 --> 27:37.830
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

27:37.830 --> 27:40.990
>> Sadly I vote to evict my
supercoach Clay.

27:40.990 --> 27:40.990
>> Julie: Thank you.

27:40.990 --> 27:42.990
>> Thank you.

27:42.990 --> 27:45.120
>> Julie: Jackie made it
clear keeping Shelli what be

27:45.120 --> 27:46.990
a bad move for her game.

27:46.990 --> 27:52.990
Will her vote reflect this?

27:52.990 --> 27:53.990
Hi, Jackie.

27:53.990 --> 27:55.830
>> Hi, Julie.

27:55.830 --> 27:56.990
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

27:56.990 --> 28:00.410
>> I vote to evict Clay.

28:00.410 --> 28:00.990
>> Julie: Thank you.

28:00.990 --> 28:05.990
>> Thank you, Julie.

28:05.990 --> 28:09.990
The vote is four votes to
evict Clay and zero votes to

28:09.990 --> 28:10.990
evict Shelli.

28:10.990 --> 28:11.990
The rest of the house guests
cast their votes live when

28:11.990 --> 28:12.700
we return.

28:12.700 --> 28:14.990
Stay with us.

28:14.990 --> 28:16.990
(Cheers and applause)

28:49.700 --> 28:50.990
>> Julie: Welcome back to
"Big Brother".

28:50.990 --> 28:53.990
The house guests are voting
live to evict either Clay or

28:53.990 --> 28:54.000
Shelli.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.990
So far it's four votes to
evict Clay and zero votes to

28:57.990 --> 28:59.990
evict Shelli.

28:59.990 --> 29:02.990
Let's continue with the live
vote.

29:02.990 --> 29:06.000
Though part of the sixth
sense alliance, Liz and her

29:06.000 --> 29:09.990
twin sister Julia have
decided to look out for

29:09.990 --> 29:10.000
themselves.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.990
What will Liz do?

29:12.990 --> 29:13.990
>> Hi, Liz.

29:13.990 --> 29:15.990
>> Hi, Julie.

29:15.990 --> 29:17.120
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.990
>> I vote to evict Clay.

29:19.990 --> 29:20.990
>> Julie: Thank you.

29:20.990 --> 29:23.990
>> Thank you.

29:23.990 --> 29:25.990
>> Julie: It's official w
five votes to evict Clay,

29:25.990 --> 29:27.990
Clay will leave the house
tonight.

29:27.990 --> 29:33.540
But let's see how the other
votes fall.

29:33.540 --> 29:34.410
Hi, Julia.

29:34.410 --> 29:35.990
>> Hi, Julie.

29:35.990 --> 29:38.000
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.990
>> I vote to evict Clay.

29:39.990 --> 29:42.990
>> Julie: Thank you.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.990
Steve has yet to formally
declare which side of the

29:45.990 --> 29:47.540
house he's aligned with.

29:47.540 --> 29:51.990
His vote tonight should make
it clear.

29:51.990 --> 29:52.830
Hi, Steve.

29:52.830 --> 29:53.990
>> Hi, Julie.

29:53.990 --> 29:54.990
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

29:54.990 --> 29:55.990
>> I vote to evict Clay.

29:55.990 --> 29:57.410
Thank you.

29:57.410 --> 30:00.410
>> Thank you, Julie.

30:00.410 --> 30:02.990
>> Julie: Last week Becky
tried to protect both Clay

30:02.990 --> 30:07.990
and Shelli, so which one
will she protect tonight.

30:07.990 --> 30:08.990
Hi, Becky.

30:08.990 --> 30:10.990
>> Hi, Julie.

30:10.990 --> 30:11.990
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

30:11.990 --> 30:12.990
>> Clay is an incredible
guy.

30:12.990 --> 30:14.120
And I will do what he wants.

30:14.120 --> 30:16.990
I sadly vote to evict Clay.

30:16.990 --> 30:17.540
>> Julie: Thank you.

30:17.540 --> 30:19.000
>> Thank you.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.290
>> Julie: In the past, John
played the pawn for Shelli.

30:23.290 --> 30:27.990
Tonight he must choose
between the king and the

30:27.990 --> 30:28.410
queen.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.540
Hi, John.

30:29.540 --> 30:29.990
>> Hello.

30:29.990 --> 30:33.990
>> Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

30:33.990 --> 30:36.540
>> I vote to he chrikt-- evict
Clay.

30:36.540 --> 30:36.990
>> Julie: Thank you.

30:36.990 --> 30:49.990
>> All right.

30:49.990 --> 30:51.990
>> Julie: All of the votes
are in.

30:51.990 --> 30:54.120
Let's give the news to the
house guests.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.990
House guests, the votes are
in.

30:56.990 --> 30:59.950
When I reveal the vote, the
evicted house guest will

30:59.950 --> 31:02.990
have just a few moments to
say good-bye, gather his or

31:02.990 --> 31:06.990
her belongings and walk out
the front door.

31:06.990 --> 31:13.540
By a vote of 9-0, Clay, you
are evicted from the big

31:13.540 --> 31:41.700
brother house.

31:41.700 --> 31:55.990
>>
(Cheers and applause)

31:55.990 --> 31:58.990
Bye, Clay.

31:58.990 --> 32:30.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Come on over

32:30.990 --> 32:34.990
.

32:34.990 --> 32:37.990
>> Oh pie God.

32:37.990 --> 32:41.990
>> It's going to be okay.

32:41.990 --> 32:43.990
>> Julie: Wow, Clay, you
must really love her to walk

32:43.990 --> 32:46.990
away from a shot at a
half-million dollars.

32:46.990 --> 32:51.990
>> I mean this has been her
dream to do this.

32:51.990 --> 32:53.990
And it's an unfortunate
situation for both of us.

32:53.990 --> 32:56.990
But I didn't want it be the
one to take that from her.

32:56.990 --> 33:02.990
You know, she was put in a
situation,-- against her,

33:02.990 --> 33:04.990
then she deserved a shot.

33:04.990 --> 33:07.990
And I'm okay with giving
that to her.

33:07.990 --> 33:09.990
>> Julie: What are your
feelings for her.

33:09.990 --> 33:11.990
You've known each other for
50 days.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.120
She talked about you're my
heart.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.990
Wir's going to have a great
life outside of the house.

33:16.990 --> 33:19.990
Is this the real deal
between the two of you?

33:19.990 --> 33:23.830
>> You know, I think so.

33:23.830 --> 33:26.990
In this house, you know, you
spend 24 hours a day with

33:26.990 --> 33:28.990
somebody, seven days a week.

33:28.990 --> 33:32.830
And things kind of escalate
quickly.

33:32.830 --> 33:36.990
And she has been there for
me motionally.

33:36.990 --> 33:38.540
Personally on a game level.

33:38.540 --> 33:39.990
She's been there for me.

33:39.990 --> 33:45.990
And you know, it grows.

33:45.990 --> 33:49.990
And-- I didn't imagine this
but it has.

33:49.990 --> 33:50.990
>> Julie: Do you love her?

33:50.990 --> 33:52.830
>> That's a big word.

33:52.830 --> 33:53.830
You know.

33:53.830 --> 33:54.990
>> Julie: More than a
half-million dollars.

33:54.990 --> 33:56.990
>> More than half a million
dollars for sure.

33:56.990 --> 33:58.990
>> Julie: You play football
competitively.

33:58.990 --> 34:03.990
Have you ever given up in a
game like this before?

34:03.990 --> 34:07.120
>> You know, I wouldn't
really call it giving up.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.990
It's just when you care
about somebody like I do for

34:09.990 --> 34:11.990
her, I'm okay with that.

34:11.990 --> 34:15.990
I'm okay with her having
another shot at winning this

34:15.990 --> 34:16.990
game.

34:16.990 --> 34:19.990
Because if she wins, I feel
like I win.

34:19.990 --> 34:21.120
>> Julie: I want to talk
about the game.

34:21.120 --> 34:25.000
When you got nominated, you
looked shocked.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.290
And yet you had something to
do with saving Austin and

34:29.290 --> 34:30.540
evicting Jason.

34:30.540 --> 34:32.990
Do you take any
responsibility for why

34:32.990 --> 34:35.290
you're sitting across from
me right now?

34:35.290 --> 34:36.410
>> Fully.

34:36.410 --> 34:37.990
We decided to go with that.

34:37.990 --> 34:39.990
That was our choice.

34:39.990 --> 34:42.990
It doesn't mat ferr we came
up with the plan or not.

34:42.990 --> 34:46.990
We were the ones that sent
him home and ultimately

34:46.990 --> 34:47.990
saved Austin.

34:47.990 --> 34:49.990
You know, I didn't regret
it.

34:49.990 --> 34:51.290
It is what it is.

34:51.290 --> 34:54.990
You know, Austin obviously
pulled on the heart strings

34:54.990 --> 34:57.410
and we ened up in the same
spot that he didn't want to

34:57.410 --> 34:57.990
be in.

34:57.990 --> 34:58.990
So.

34:58.990 --> 35:00.990
>> Julie: In the event you
were the one he vicked

35:00.990 --> 35:02.990
tonight your house taped
some good-bye messages.

35:02.990 --> 35:04.990
Look over here, watch and
listen.

35:04.990 --> 35:05.990
>> Okay.

35:05.990 --> 35:08.990
>> Clay, you guys were
adorable as a couple.

35:08.990 --> 35:12.990
It's just, that's why it
sent you out the door.

35:12.990 --> 35:14.990
I'm sorry that it went this
way for you.

35:14.990 --> 35:16.990
>> Clay, we've had such a
great time.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.990
We have he been boys since
we can one of of this game.

35:18.990 --> 35:20.990
Voting you out was probably
the toughest thing I had to

35:20.990 --> 35:21.830
do.

35:21.830 --> 35:22.990
I hope you can understand
that.

35:22.990 --> 35:25.830
And there's no hard feels
and we can be boys after

35:25.830 --> 35:25.990
this.

35:25.990 --> 35:29.990
>> Clay, I'm so sorry that
this had to happen.

35:29.990 --> 35:32.990
I'm going to miss that
beautiful, pretty face of

35:32.990 --> 35:32.990
yours.

35:32.990 --> 35:36.990
And watching you do your
hair for five hours a day.

35:36.990 --> 35:39.410
Miss you already.

35:39.410 --> 35:43.990
>> Clay, you have absolutely
been my light inside of this

35:43.990 --> 35:43.990
house.

35:43.990 --> 35:46.990
And I don't know how I'm
going to live in here

35:46.990 --> 35:48.540
without you.

35:48.540 --> 35:51.410
I'm really looking forward
to our first date and thank

35:51.410 --> 35:54.990
you for being so incredibly
wonderful and for sharing

35:54.990 --> 35:57.990
this experience with me.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.990
>> Julie: Clay, before you
go, we all want to know, we

36:00.990 --> 36:05.290
saw a tipsy Meg in the
bathroom with you.

36:05.290 --> 36:07.410
There was hugging there were
words.

36:07.410 --> 36:09.990
There was a lot of-- there
was a lot of touching.

36:09.990 --> 36:11.990
What was going on over there
in the bathroom.

36:11.990 --> 36:14.000
>> Oh, man, that's Meg.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.990
She has been scampering
around the house the whole

36:16.990 --> 36:16.990
time.

36:16.990 --> 36:23.000
And she's had her fair share
of show-mances with pretty

36:23.000 --> 36:23.990
much everyone in the house.

36:23.990 --> 36:28.990
Not me, but you know what, I
lev her, there is -- I look

36:28.990 --> 36:32.290
forward to visiting her
outside of this house.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.990
>> Julie: Good luck to you.

36:33.990 --> 36:34.990
>> Thank you.

36:34.990 --> 36:35.990
>> Julie: Stay right there.

36:35.990 --> 36:37.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Coming up, it's a

36:37.990 --> 36:41.290
live head of household
competition and "the sixth

36:41.290 --> 36:42.990
sense" alliance has the
numbers.

36:42.990 --> 36:45.990
It's a fight for survival
for James and his allies

36:45.990 --> 36:46.990
next.

36:46.990 --> 36:47.990
Stay with us.

37:04.700 --> 37:05.410
"Big Brother".

37:05.410 --> 37:08.990
It's now time to crown a new
head of household who will

37:08.990 --> 37:10.990
become the most powerful
player in the game.

37:10.990 --> 37:13.990
Let's head to the backyard
and get things started.

37:13.990 --> 37:17.990
House guests, before we
begin tonight's head of

37:17.990 --> 37:21.830
household competition, let
me congratulate you.

37:21.830 --> 37:26.990
From hear on out, every
evicted house guest will be

37:26.990 --> 37:27.990
headed to the jury house.

37:27.990 --> 37:32.990
(Cheers and applause)
But you should know just

37:32.990 --> 37:36.990
because you've made it to
the jury, it doesn't

37:36.990 --> 37:40.990
necessarily mean you're out
of the game.

37:40.990 --> 37:43.990
With that, the power is back
up for grabs.

37:43.990 --> 37:47.990
James, as outgoing head of
household, you are not

37:47.990 --> 37:48.990
eligible to compete.

37:48.990 --> 37:52.410
This competition is called
midway mayhem.

37:52.410 --> 37:53.990
And here is how it works.

37:53.990 --> 37:58.990
On my go, you will fill up
your funnel with as much gas

37:58.990 --> 38:03.990
as you can and transfer it
across the yard to your gas

38:03.990 --> 38:04.290
tank.

38:04.290 --> 38:09.990
As the gas tank fills, three
checkered balls will rise.

38:09.990 --> 38:12.990
When you request reach any
one of your checkered balls,

38:12.990 --> 38:15.990
you will have a decision to
make.

38:15.990 --> 38:22.990
You can claim the hoh an end
the game or you can claim a

38:22.990 --> 38:24.700
prize and keep playing.

38:24.700 --> 38:30.990
Either 5,000 or if you don't
ever want to be a have not

38:30.990 --> 38:33.830
again claim the never not
path.

38:33.830 --> 38:37.000
It is possible for one house
guest to win all three

38:37.000 --> 38:38.990
prizes.

38:38.990 --> 38:45.990
But as soon as someone
claims the hoh, the game

38:45.990 --> 38:46.990
will end.

38:46.990 --> 38:47.830
Everyone understand?

38:47.830 --> 38:49.990
>> Yes.

38:49.990 --> 38:56.990
>> Great, then get on your
mark, get set, go.

38:56.990 --> 39:05.830
Oh pie gosh.

39:05.830 --> 39:06.830
-- My gosh.

39:06.830 --> 39:24.990
>> This is totally mine, you
guys, I'm winning this.

39:24.990 --> 39:27.990
Let it down, Alex.

39:27.990 --> 39:32.990
>> I'm killing it, you guys.

39:32.990 --> 39:33.990
>> Meg, you're going to get
there.

39:33.990 --> 39:37.410
>> Come on, you are going to
get there you just have to

39:37.410 --> 39:37.990
get there.

39:37.990 --> 39:44.990
>> You are already here.

39:44.990 --> 39:47.990
>> I don't know about this.

39:47.990 --> 39:49.830
>> Julie: That's Meg's first
couple.

39:49.830 --> 39:50.990
>> Okay, that's right.

39:50.990 --> 39:53.990
Thank you, Julie, thank you.

39:53.990 --> 39:58.120
>> Slow and steady.

39:58.120 --> 40:00.830
>>> Oh, man, I don't know
about this one.

40:00.830 --> 40:01.950
>> Company on, Meg.

40:01.950 --> 40:03.990
>> You always have to get
two.

40:03.990 --> 40:09.990
>> I will start scootching.

40:09.990 --> 40:13.990
>> Julie: Becky is jamming.

40:13.990 --> 40:17.410
>> Julia, with another
cupful.

40:17.410 --> 40:20.990
Liz with another cupful.

40:20.990 --> 40:28.990
>> How is that-- oh pie
gosh.

40:28.990 --> 40:32.990
>> Doing this right now.

40:32.990 --> 40:33.830
>> .

40:33.830 --> 40:35.830
>> Julie: When we return,
we'll rejoin this all

40:35.830 --> 40:37.990
important hoh competition.

40:37.990 --> 40:39.990
Will "the sixth sense"
alliance take back control

40:39.990 --> 40:40.990
of the house?

40:40.990 --> 40:44.990
Or will James and his crew
remain in power?

40:44.990 --> 40:45.990
Stay with us.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.990
>> Julie: Welcome back to
"Big Brother".

41:06.990 --> 41:10.990
Tune in Sunday to see which
house guest will raise to

41:10.990 --> 41:10.990
power.

41:10.990 --> 41:13.120
And who will be nominated
for eviction.

41:13.120 --> 41:16.990
And on Wednesday, the power
of veto is back up for

41:16.990 --> 41:17.990
grabs.

41:17.990 --> 41:21.990
Then 1 week from tonight,
it's double eviction time.

41:21.990 --> 41:24.990
That is right, it's a whole
week's worth of Big Brother

41:24.990 --> 41:25.990
in one night.

41:25.990 --> 41:28.990
As two people will be sent
to the jury house.

41:28.990 --> 41:31.990
And don't miss "Big Brother
after dark" airing tonight

41:31.990 --> 41:34.990

James, I can hear you
muttering my name in

42:33.990 --> 42:34.700
disappointment.

42:34.700 --> 42:35.990
>> No, you're killing it.

>> Yeah, you're killing it.

42:36.990 --> 42:40.990
