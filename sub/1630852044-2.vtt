- We have no
news essentially yet.

52:29.983 --> 52:31.684

that kind of a home,

a house like that.

52:39.826 --> 52:41.393
But there's not a
lot of people today--

52:41.427 --> 52:43.797
They want these modern white
boxes and someone's gonna get

52:43.829 --> 52:45.532
a great deal, 'cause
everything is cyclical.
