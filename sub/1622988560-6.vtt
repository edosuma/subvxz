I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm sorry, I don't.

34:29.026 --> 34:30.778
You failed to come
to a complete stop.

34:30.861 --> 34:33.238
I could've sworn I did.

34:33.322 --> 34:35.824
There was no traffic.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.996
Have you been drinking, ma'am?

34:41.079 --> 34:44.541
Uh, a-a glass of wine
with lunch, but...

34:44.625 --> 34:46.126
Step out of the car, please.

34:46.210 --> 34:48.212
[sighs]

34:50.130 --> 34:51.882
Jimmy. How's it going?

34:51.965 --> 34:56.345
Hey, can't complain.
Downtime on the company dime.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.055
Find anything
in Fowkkes's office?

34:58.138 --> 35:00.098
A couple of WhatsApp messages

35:00.182 --> 35:02.810
between Fowkkes and Rogers
saved to his computer.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.813
And two wire transfers
to Fowkkes' account

35:05.896 --> 35:08.732
from a shell company
owned by Rogers.

35:08.816 --> 35:11.735
Rogers: "Franzen is a problem."

35:11.819 --> 35:14.863
Fowkkes: "A solvable one."

35:14.947 --> 35:17.449
Rogers: "So solve it."

35:17.533 --> 35:19.910
- I guess he did.
- [sighs]

35:19.993 --> 35:23.580
So Fowkkes was the, uh,
cutout, huh? The middleman.

35:25.123 --> 35:29.253
But if Rogers, his client, had
no contact with the hit man...

35:29.336 --> 35:31.213
How'd he order
the hit on Fowkkes?

35:31.296 --> 35:32.840
Yeah, well, maybe he didn't.

35:32.923 --> 35:35.133
Let's haul his ass in
and find out.

35:40.180 --> 35:44.184
One thirty-one, 132.

35:44.268 --> 35:45.894
- Partner.
- 133.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.312
Anne?

35:47.396 --> 35:49.398
You can stop.

35:50.607 --> 35:52.192
[sighs]

35:53.652 --> 35:57.155
Your beef is with me.
Leave her the fuck out of it.

35:57.239 --> 35:59.700
Lieutenant Billets,
your friend rolled a stop sign,

35:59.783 --> 36:02.452
has alcohol on her breath.
Just doing our job.

36:02.536 --> 36:05.205
Just like you like it--
by the book.

36:08.542 --> 36:09.751
[Bosch] Your Honor,
both payments were made

36:09.835 --> 36:11.211
just prior to the shootings.

36:11.295 --> 36:13.964
The first for Vincent Franzen
and Honey Chandler.

36:14.047 --> 36:17.175
The second for an attempted
hit on Madeline Bosch.

36:17.259 --> 36:19.887
Carl Rogers wired
the money to Fowkkes.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.514
Fowkkes then
transferred those funds

36:22.598 --> 36:25.058
to an offshore account we
believe belongs to the hit man.

36:28.937 --> 36:30.772
You know you have
a bit of a reputation

36:30.856 --> 36:32.774
around here, Detective.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.862
But Donna always
spoke highly of you.

36:37.905 --> 36:39.740
Means a lot.

36:40.782 --> 36:41.909
Yes, it does.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.957
- Godspeed, gentlemen.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

36:50.334 --> 36:52.419
[jet engine whirring]

36:55.047 --> 36:56.924
Marco's already on board, sir.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.634
Pilot's doing his final check.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.260
Thank you.

37:00.344 --> 37:02.387
[siren wailing]

37:02.471 --> 37:04.264
[tires squealing]

37:07.976 --> 37:10.354
Carl Rogers?

37:10.437 --> 37:12.522
You're under arrest for murder.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.443
[distant plane engine whirring]

37:25.786 --> 37:27.788
- [sighs]
- [door closes]

37:31.249 --> 37:32.876
[toilet flushes]

37:35.754 --> 37:37.839
[inhales deeply through nose]

37:40.801 --> 37:42.260
L.T.?

37:43.762 --> 37:46.348
You okay?

37:48.141 --> 37:50.852
Leonard and Norris just scared
the shit out of my girlfriend.

37:53.522 --> 37:54.731
You're getting to them.

37:54.815 --> 37:56.733
Mm.

37:59.987 --> 38:01.905
We're all sick of this shit.

38:01.989 --> 38:03.991
[sighs]

38:05.325 --> 38:08.745
Most of us don't have the power
to do anything about it.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.795
[door opens]

38:16.878 --> 38:19.673
We know you ordered the hits on
Vincent Franzen, Honey Chandler

38:19.756 --> 38:21.925
- and Madeline Bosch.
- That's ridiculous.

38:22.009 --> 38:24.011
My client is a businessman,
not a gangster.

38:24.094 --> 38:25.721
He has no comment.

38:25.804 --> 38:29.016
And your personal attorney,
J. Reason Fowkkes.

38:29.099 --> 38:32.853
[Baron] Again, my client
has nothing to say.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.606
He just did.

38:43.905 --> 38:45.991
[Robertson] Look at those hands.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.493
I could watch you
do that all night long.

38:48.577 --> 38:51.705
Such style,
such technique, such...

38:51.788 --> 38:53.915
[Shaz] Such a line of baloney.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.918
Easy, Casanova.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.295
[Bosch] Hey, lovebirds.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.630
Hey. And one for my friend.

39:00.714 --> 39:03.467
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I'm all good. Thanks, Shaz.

39:05.469 --> 39:08.555
- How'd it go with Rogers?
- Cool customer.

39:08.638 --> 39:10.849
Until I accused him
of ordering the hit on Fowkkes.

39:10.932 --> 39:13.643
- Then he nearly spit the bit.
- He talk?

39:13.727 --> 39:16.313
Didn't have to. Could read it
all over his face.

39:16.396 --> 39:17.773
Believe him?

39:17.856 --> 39:19.733
I think he'd pass the polygraph.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.319
Any other candidates?

39:22.402 --> 39:24.780
Bottom-feeder like Fowkkes
has lots of enemies.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.616
Found one.
Another Fowkkes client,

39:27.699 --> 39:29.701
mobster out of Vegas
named Willy Datz.

39:29.785 --> 39:32.329
Got a rep for making
his problems disappear.

39:34.831 --> 39:37.084
So Datz ordered
the hit on Fowkkes?

39:37.167 --> 39:40.087
Cover his tracks.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.130
The burner could confirm it.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.007
No, I dropped it off
with my tech guy,

39:44.091 --> 39:46.134
but it'll be a couple days
before we get anything back.

39:47.344 --> 39:49.221
A couple days?

39:49.304 --> 39:50.847
That works for me.

39:52.766 --> 39:54.267
I'll bet.

39:54.351 --> 39:56.603
[both chuckle]

40:02.984 --> 40:05.237
Now a bad time?

40:05.320 --> 40:07.405
Not at all. Beer?

40:07.489 --> 40:08.949
No, thank you.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.957
I'm sorry about Sobel.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.210
[quietly] Thanks.

40:22.254 --> 40:24.297
She was, uh...

40:27.801 --> 40:29.302
Anyway.

40:30.846 --> 40:32.806
What brings you
all the way up here?

40:33.807 --> 40:36.226
Something I need to say.

40:36.309 --> 40:38.728
Go ahead. Listening.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.443
I let a lot
of people down lately.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.780
Long list.

40:48.864 --> 40:51.908
My kids, my ex.

40:53.410 --> 40:56.830
The job. You, most of all.

40:56.913 --> 40:58.373
Forget it.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.792
Let me finish.

41:02.836 --> 41:07.007
I should've showed up,
really showed up,

41:07.090 --> 41:09.968
the night of the fire
and every day since.

41:10.051 --> 41:12.596
You're right.
You should have.

41:13.638 --> 41:16.099
Always the hard ass.

41:20.061 --> 41:22.147
You helped save
Maddie's life yesterday.

41:24.774 --> 41:26.610
I put her in danger
in the first place.

41:26.693 --> 41:28.361
True.

41:29.863 --> 41:31.239
Hmm.

41:34.701 --> 41:36.745
We square?

41:39.456 --> 41:41.374
We'll get there.

41:46.046 --> 41:48.215
Something else?

41:50.258 --> 41:52.636
Avril.

41:52.719 --> 41:54.471
That night.

41:54.554 --> 41:55.972
I went there to kill him.

41:56.056 --> 41:57.682
I know.

41:58.725 --> 42:01.061
I wanted justice.

42:01.144 --> 42:02.395
Did you get it?

42:05.732 --> 42:07.734
I don't know.

42:11.446 --> 42:13.406
I just don't know.
