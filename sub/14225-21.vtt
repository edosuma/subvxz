WEBVTT

00:04.213 --> 00:06.463
Time for a little
rock skipping 101.

00:06.465 --> 00:07.997
If you don't throw it
at exactly the right angle,

00:08.033 --> 00:09.500
it'll sink like a stone.

00:09.535 --> 00:12.011
It is a stone.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.173
Sinking and breaking windows
is all it's good for.

00:15.524 --> 00:17.933
Okay, Emma,
how about you go first?

00:17.968 --> 00:19.018
Make sure you do us
Woodchucks proud!

00:19.053 --> 00:21.803
Hey, you're lucky I'm
even holding this thing.

00:21.838 --> 00:23.346
The last rock I picked up
was ten carats

00:23.382 --> 00:25.462
and came with an armed guard.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.285
Stand aside, ladies.

00:29.321 --> 00:31.738
I have calculated the
perfect angle and velocity

00:31.773 --> 00:32.939
for maximum skippage.

00:36.787 --> 00:39.746
(SQUAWKING) (THUD)

00:39.781 --> 00:41.482
Well, you didn't skip a rock,

00:41.517 --> 00:43.277
but you might have
got us dinner.

00:44.561 --> 00:45.660
Ooh! Here's another stone.

00:45.695 --> 00:48.038
Go get us a pig, I'm in
the mood for some bacon.

00:51.143 --> 00:53.018
<i>¶ Here we go</i>

00:53.054 --> 00:55.862
<i>¶ We're leaving the city
behind right now</i>

00:55.897 --> 00:57.873
<i>¶ Let's gather by

01:51.595 --> 01:53.478
Aw, <i>merci!</i>

01:53.513 --> 01:54.737
Huh?

01:54.773 --> 01:55.773
Never mind.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.360
So, do you like creme fraiche
with your lobster crepes?

02:01.864 --> 02:03.655
Wow.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.799
I'm surprised you even know
about creme fraiche and crepes.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.554
I didn't, until I did an Internet
search for "rich people food."

02:10.197 --> 02:13.139
Aw, this is so romantic!

02:13.175 --> 02:14.240
I did an Internet search
for you too,

02:14.275 --> 02:17.515
but it was just to make sure you
didn't have a criminal record.

02:18.747 --> 02:20.613
Aww, young love.

02:20.649 --> 02:21.649
(MIMICS RETCHING)

02:23.234 --> 02:24.943
Xander, you have
another phone call.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.978
I'll be right back.

02:28.281 --> 02:31.591
Wow, your little boy toy
really went all out.

02:31.627 --> 02:34.361
(CHUCKLES) Only one
explanation for that.

02:34.396 --> 02:36.963
Yup, he really likes me.

02:36.999 --> 02:39.023
Oh, Emma.

02:39.059 --> 02:42.219
Sweet, naive, wrinkle-free Emma.

02:42.254 --> 02:45.355
Xander has been getting all
kinds of phone calls lately.

02:45.391 --> 02:49.534
Obviously, he feels guilty
because he's cheating on you.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.028
(CHUCKLES) He is not!

02:51.063 --> 02:52.553
Xander is not that kind of guy.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.214
They're all that kind of guy.

02:54.249 --> 02:56.024
I've been cheated on
millions of times

02:56.060 --> 02:57.300
and I'm delightful.

02:59.730 --> 03:00.730
Sorry about that.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.698
So, uh, who called?

03:03.734 --> 03:04.734
No one important.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.160
Secretive.

03:07.195 --> 03:10.513
I'll bet "no one important"
is a bendy gymnast back home.

03:13.802 --> 03:14.802
TIFFANY: You!

03:14.828 --> 03:17.029
I know you took it!

03:17.031 --> 03:19.105
If you're talking about
your ability to have fun,

03:19.141 --> 03:20.781
I think you were born that way.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.193
I'm talking about my violin.

03:24.229 --> 03:25.837
It's gone.
Where did you hide it?

03:25.872 --> 03:27.489
I didn't.

03:27.524 --> 03:30.075
Maybe it ran away to find someone
who can actually play it.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.397
This from someone whose
idea of entertainment is

03:35.432 --> 03:38.341
to watch stupid viral
videos over and over.

03:38.376 --> 03:41.277
They are not stupid.
They're hilarious.

03:41.313 --> 03:44.589
In fact, I want to watch "Monkey
Sniffing His Own Butt" right now.

03:47.502 --> 03:49.077
Hey!

03:49.112 --> 03:50.912
My tablet's gone!
Did you take it?

03:50.947 --> 03:54.190
No! And you're not supposed
to have a tablet at camp!

03:54.225 --> 03:55.465
I have a doctor's note.

03:59.623 --> 04:02.023
There's no such disease as
"tablet deficiency."

04:07.572 --> 04:10.240
Okay, I know this sounds crazy,

04:10.275 --> 04:11.583
but I think Xander
might be cheating on me.

04:11.618 --> 04:12.918
(SCOFFS) I knew it.

04:12.953 --> 04:17.055
No one is that charming
without a secret dark side.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.274
No way!
I've known Xander a long time,

04:19.309 --> 04:21.000
and he's not the kind of guy
who would cheat.

04:21.036 --> 04:22.344
Oh, that does sound like Xander.

04:22.379 --> 04:24.754
He is as honest as they come,
and quite charming.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.768
But he's been getting
secret phone calls all week.

04:29.803 --> 04:32.779
(SCOFFS) Care to explain, Lou?

04:32.814 --> 04:35.724
Emma, if you're so worried, why
don't you just go talk to Xander?

04:35.759 --> 04:39.660
I don't want him to think I'm a
paranoid freak who doesn't trust him.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.336
Maybe I should
go through his trash.

04:44.885 --> 04:48.136
So, I told the guy, "If I
have to pay for the movie",

04:48.171 --> 04:50.713
"and the large popcorn
and the artisan hotdog"

04:50.749 --> 04:52.791
"and the gourmet vegan nachos,"

04:52.826 --> 04:54.651
"you at least have to
sit next to me."

04:54.686 --> 04:56.836
Gladys!

04:56.871 --> 04:59.764
Zuri took my violin! Did not!

04:59.800 --> 05:03.017
But Tiffany took my tablet!

05:03.053 --> 05:07.405
Which I need for my serious
medical condition.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.292
Actually, I took your tablet.
Why?

05:10.327 --> 05:12.994
Because it's against camp rules.

05:13.030 --> 05:14.228
But I have a note!

05:14.264 --> 05:16.064
A fake note.

05:16.099 --> 05:17.841
Like last week,
when "your doctor" said

05:17.876 --> 05:18.674
you needed extra desserts

05:18.710 --> 05:21.519
because you were diagnosed
with a "low pudding count."

05:23.240 --> 05:24.939
LPC is a real thing!

05:28.294 --> 05:29.978
Make Zuri give me
back my violin!

05:30.013 --> 05:31.729
She didn't take it. I did.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.841
I got sick and tired of getting
complaints about your playing.

05:34.876 --> 05:35.717
From who?

05:35.752 --> 05:37.127
Everybody!

05:37.162 --> 05:39.854
The campers here, the
campers across the lake,

05:39.889 --> 05:42.107
the Canadian mounted police.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.982
Wow, Tiffany, you're
an international annoyer.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.413
You'll both get your stuff
back at the end of camp.

05:49.449 --> 05:50.432
Hey, kids! Remember,
no swimming in the lake

05:50.467 --> 05:53.009
until we deal with that
little deadly snake problem.

05:55.389 --> 05:58.556
Zuri, I'm so sorry I accused
you of taking my violin.

05:59.885 --> 06:00.885
I forgive you.

06:01.803 --> 06:02.803
And?

06:03.822 --> 06:05.639
You are...

06:05.674 --> 06:06.834
Not swimming in that lake.

06:09.252 --> 06:10.251
Maybe she'll send me a card.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.487
ZURI: Don't hold your breath!

06:14.616 --> 06:16.440
Hey, Xander.

06:16.476 --> 06:19.102
It's weird, my trash is
scattered everywhere.

06:19.137 --> 06:21.704
Those bears... So untidy.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.071
Xander, I need to
ask you something.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.120
Are you cheating on me?

06:29.514 --> 06:31.598
What? No!

06:31.633 --> 06:33.524
Why would you even think that?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.210
Because you were
acting kind of guilty,

06:35.245 --> 06:36.805
like you were hiding something.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.231
Actually, I have been
hiding something from you,

06:40.266 --> 06:42.217
and I do feel guilty.

06:42.252 --> 06:43.412
So that was a guilt crepe!

06:44.779 --> 06:46.104
What are you hiding?

06:46.139 --> 06:48.779
Whatever it is, it's
obviously not in your trash.

06:49.459 --> 06:51.299
Because the bear
would have found it.

06:51.878 --> 06:55.755
I should have told you this
before, but I just couldn't.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.699
The truth is, I have to
leave camp.

06:59.035 --> 07:01.802
Oh, that's not so bad.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.118
For how long? A few days?
A week?

07:04.041 --> 07:05.748
No, for good.

07:12.875 --> 07:14.040
I can't believe you're leaving!

07:14.076 --> 07:16.626
I'm sorry, but my high school
football team practices

07:16.661 --> 07:18.502
got moved up to next week.

07:18.538 --> 07:19.846
So, that's what the
phone calls were about?

07:19.881 --> 07:21.372
Yes.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.458
But what about us?

07:23.493 --> 07:25.176
Emma, you know
I want to be with you.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.930
Then stay! There, problem solved.
Let's hit the lake!

07:28.965 --> 07:32.233
I can't! Okay, zipline?

07:32.268 --> 07:35.979
Look, Emma, playing football
is a family tradition.

07:36.014 --> 07:39.349
We even have a jockstrap that's been
passed down for three generations.

07:39.384 --> 07:43.128
Is that supposed to get me
to understand your decision?

07:43.130 --> 07:44.337
Because I'm not really happy
that you're choosing

07:44.372 --> 07:46.489
used underwear over me!

07:46.524 --> 07:48.375
Hello! What are we
talking about?

07:48.410 --> 07:51.770
Xander's leaving camp to play football
in his grandfather's jockstrap!

07:53.732 --> 07:55.506
That is horrible.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.502
What will your grandfather wear?

08:01.806 --> 08:04.206
Oh, man! Gladys locked her door.

08:04.242 --> 08:06.209
Now what do we do?

08:06.244 --> 08:07.724
Don't worry. I got this.

08:10.082 --> 08:11.823
You can pick locks?

08:11.858 --> 08:14.526
How else could I get into
the library after hours?

08:15.962 --> 08:17.122
Talk about a wasted talent.

08:23.678 --> 08:25.695
Emma, I really think
you should talk to Xander.

08:25.730 --> 08:27.105
He's already made his decision,

08:27.140 --> 08:28.697
so why should I talk to him?

08:28.733 --> 08:30.149
Number one, because
you guys are a couple,

08:30.184 --> 08:31.851
and couples talk things out.

08:31.886 --> 08:35.255
And number two, he's outside the
door with flowers and chocolates.

08:35.290 --> 08:40.477
XANDER: Actually, I couldn't find
any chocolates, but I have a bagel!

08:40.512 --> 08:42.752
Make that flowers
and a doughy treat.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.273
It doesn't make any difference.

08:45.308 --> 08:46.382
I don't want to talk to him!

08:46.417 --> 08:50.002
Okay, fine, but Xander's dad is
coming to pick him up today,

08:50.038 --> 08:52.799
and I think you'll really regret
it if you leave things this way.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.648
Seriously, a bagel?

09:02.684 --> 09:05.451
It was either this,
or furry strawberries.

09:05.487 --> 09:08.529
So, she doesn't want to talk?

09:08.565 --> 09:11.708
No, but I know Emma,
and she'll come around.

09:11.743 --> 09:14.235
Meanwhile, since your football
practice is starting,

09:14.270 --> 09:16.196
we need to get you in shape.

09:16.231 --> 09:18.197
The only pass you made
this summer was at Emma.

09:18.233 --> 09:19.983
(BLOWING WHISTLE)

09:20.018 --> 09:22.844
Knees up! And faster, before the
bus driver needs these tires back!

09:23.980 --> 09:25.060
(PANTING)

09:26.657 --> 09:28.082
Can I get a drink of water?

09:28.117 --> 09:29.517
No! You can drink
when you're dead!

09:30.295 --> 09:31.415
What does that even mean?

09:32.639 --> 09:34.247
I don't know! (BLOWING WHISTLE)

09:34.282 --> 09:38.459
I just know that I'm gonna stay
on you like stink on rice!

09:38.495 --> 09:40.055
I don't think that's
the expression.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.994
Um, have you had the rice here?

09:44.450 --> 09:45.850
Fair point. Okay.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.345
I am ready to help Xander
rehearse football.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.380
Batter up!

09:52.951 --> 09:53.951
Nothing but net.

09:55.870 --> 09:59.306
You really think Ravi can help
me be a better football player?

09:59.308 --> 10:01.491
No, but I think he'll
take your mind off of Emma,

10:01.526 --> 10:03.846
or the very least
make you laugh.

10:04.737 --> 10:07.314
Hut one! Hut two! Omaha!

10:07.349 --> 10:10.850
What is the largest city
in the state of Nebraska?

10:12.621 --> 10:14.420
This isn't a test.

10:14.455 --> 10:16.431
That's the signal that
I'm changing the play.

10:16.466 --> 10:18.232
Fine. But I was not wrong.

10:22.305 --> 10:24.005
Hike!

10:24.040 --> 10:25.823
(SCREAMING) (THUD)

10:29.662 --> 10:31.142
(GROANS) Did we win?

10:34.059 --> 10:35.917
28. Red dog. Hike.

10:39.256 --> 10:40.179
I caught it!

10:40.215 --> 10:41.523
Keep running!

10:41.558 --> 10:42.878
Why? (SCREAMING)

10:45.095 --> 10:46.095
That's why.

10:50.425 --> 10:52.416
It's not here.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.919
I bet our stuff is in there.

10:54.954 --> 10:57.029
Wait, maybe
we shouldn't open that.

10:57.065 --> 11:00.391
There might be the body of one
of her old boyfriends in there.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.093
Don't be silly.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.737
She'd have to get a boyfriend
before she could kill one.

11:08.910 --> 11:11.686
(GASPS) Oh, my gosh,

11:11.721 --> 11:14.422
she has a creepy shrine
to my dad.

11:14.458 --> 11:17.917
Wow, this is even weirder than
yesterday's Morgan-shaped meatloaf.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.003
(DOORKNOB CLICKING)

11:21.039 --> 11:23.159
That's Gladys. Hide!

11:30.390 --> 11:32.710
Oh, I can't believe
I left this open.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.529
Hi, Morgy. Miss me?

11:37.998 --> 11:39.689
I sure did, Glady.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.451
You look ravishing.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.446
(CHUCKLES) Thank you,
these are new cargo shorts.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.217
Oh! (KISSING)

11:51.252 --> 11:52.452
(MOANING)

11:54.255 --> 11:55.975
Gonna puke! Choke it back!

11:58.885 --> 12:01.045
Camp food tastes even worse
the second time down.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.776
Nothing like a little refreshment
after some football.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.052
I could use a little more ice.

12:11.548 --> 12:12.630
Where would you put it?

12:12.665 --> 12:13.785
My earlobes are throbbing!

12:15.042 --> 12:17.034
Emma!

12:17.070 --> 12:20.221
Xander, I've been thinking,
and Lou is right.

12:20.256 --> 12:21.322
I should've accepted your bagel.

12:21.357 --> 12:22.597
Oh, it was whole wheat.

12:23.092 --> 12:24.092
Really?

12:26.871 --> 12:28.830
Anyway, it's the thought
that counts.

12:28.865 --> 12:31.557
I'm sorry for getting so upset
about your leaving.

12:31.592 --> 12:33.384
If football is your passion,

12:33.420 --> 12:35.411
and that's what really
makes you happy,

12:35.447 --> 12:36.767
then that's what you should do.

12:37.657 --> 12:38.948
Thanks, Emma.

12:38.984 --> 12:42.676
But the thing is, football
doesn't really make me happy.

12:42.712 --> 12:44.420
BOTH: What?

12:44.455 --> 12:46.364
Then why did we have to
help you practice?

12:46.399 --> 12:47.759
My hip is where my
ankle should be!

12:47.784 --> 12:49.104
And my kneecaps
are on backwards.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.045
But you've always
loved football!

12:53.081 --> 12:55.422
Actually, it's my dad
who loves football.

12:55.458 --> 12:57.141
I love music, and being here
with you guys.

12:57.176 --> 12:59.352
Great!

12:59.387 --> 13:00.527
So, can't you just
tell him how you feel?

13:00.563 --> 13:02.697
No!

13:02.699 --> 13:04.607
I once told him I wanted
to cut out red meat,

13:04.643 --> 13:06.763
and he cut me out of his will!

13:06.970 --> 13:10.805
Xander, this is your chance
to be honest with your dad.

13:10.840 --> 13:13.307
Yes, you should tell him
how you really feel.

13:13.342 --> 13:14.367
After all, it's your life.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.683
Although, I am on his side
about the red meat thing.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.422
Maybe you're right.

13:19.457 --> 13:21.833
I'm gonna tell my dad
I don't want to play football.

13:23.769 --> 13:26.737
Hey, Xan-Man! Hey, Dad.

13:26.773 --> 13:30.133
Ready to hit the road harder than a
free safety blindsiding a quarterback?

13:31.461 --> 13:32.652
Actually, no.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.353
Because I...

13:34.388 --> 13:37.090
I haven't packed yet.

13:37.125 --> 13:38.365
I'll be back in a minute.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.394
I can't believe it.

13:41.429 --> 13:43.379
Yes.

13:43.414 --> 13:44.947
If he packs all those
clothes in one minute,

13:44.982 --> 13:47.022
they are going to be
horribly wrinkled.

13:53.883 --> 13:56.767
Xander, why didn't you
tell your dad the truth?

13:56.802 --> 13:58.928
I wanted to!
But my mouth got dry,

13:58.964 --> 14:01.284
my pits got all sweaty,
and I couldn't speak!

14:01.799 --> 14:04.750
I'm so embarrassed.

14:04.785 --> 14:06.886
You have nothing to be
embarrassed about.

14:06.888 --> 14:10.047
Except maybe your boxers
that say "Rump Shaker."

14:12.009 --> 14:13.969
That was piling on. My bad.

14:15.338 --> 14:19.365
Look, Xander, I know it can be
tough to stand up to your dad,

14:19.400 --> 14:20.766
so maybe we can help.

14:22.628 --> 14:23.744
How are you gonna do that?

14:23.779 --> 14:27.156
The same way any good coach helps
their team through a tough game.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.125
By making sure they have
adorable uniforms? No.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.680
Was I close? No.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.766
(KISSING)

14:36.801 --> 14:39.035
Morgy, you know
we were meant to be.

14:41.639 --> 14:43.039
Could this get any creepier?

14:44.283 --> 14:45.691
Yes.

14:45.726 --> 14:47.418
I just noticed
her lucky raccoon paw.

14:51.566 --> 14:54.525
Hello, Christina.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.481
This is what you get
for ruining my life!

15:02.118 --> 15:04.278
She's ripping my mom apart
like monkey bread.

15:06.714 --> 15:07.714
(POP)

15:09.875 --> 15:11.926
She just bit your
mom's head off.

15:11.961 --> 15:14.121
That is disturbing
and unsanitary!

15:18.400 --> 15:20.885
Let's get out of here.
Right behind you.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.801
If we get caught,
she might bite our heads off.

15:26.518 --> 15:28.117
Forgot my canteen.

15:28.152 --> 15:31.395
I'll never make it through Bunny
cabin sing-a-long without you.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.430
(CHUCKLES)

15:34.500 --> 15:36.334
(DOOR CREAKING)

15:36.369 --> 15:38.936
Hey! What are you doin' in here?

15:38.972 --> 15:41.355
Uh, leaving.

15:41.390 --> 15:43.449
I told you this
wasn't the mess hall.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.677
Nice try.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.437
Actually, that was
a terrible try.

15:48.473 --> 15:51.699
Okay, we're here for our stuff.

15:51.734 --> 15:54.009
And you're going to
give it back to us.

15:54.044 --> 15:56.162
Give me one good reason
why I should.

15:56.197 --> 15:57.604
Because if you don't,

15:57.640 --> 16:01.091
I'll tell my dad that you
have a creepy shrine to him,

16:01.127 --> 16:03.110
you make out with his picture,

16:03.146 --> 16:05.395
and you bite the head off
dolls of my mom.

16:05.431 --> 16:07.122
(SIGHS)

16:07.158 --> 16:09.439
Okay, that's three good reasons.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.783
BOTH: Ew!

16:17.818 --> 16:19.018
Make that four good reasons.

16:21.822 --> 16:23.556
Please don't tell your dad.

16:23.591 --> 16:25.424
I don't want him to
think I'm, you know...

16:25.459 --> 16:27.019
Weird? Wacko?

16:27.044 --> 16:28.164
I was going to say quirky.

16:33.684 --> 16:36.010
Hey, Xan-Man.

16:36.045 --> 16:38.012
Bet you can't wait to
hit the gridiron, huh?

16:38.047 --> 16:40.106
Let's go. Wear your
pads on the way home.

16:40.141 --> 16:42.358
But it's like 95 degrees.

16:42.393 --> 16:43.433
Fine, don't wear the cup.

16:45.704 --> 16:46.944
So, here's the thing.

16:49.241 --> 16:52.460
I want you to hear
what I'm going to say.

16:58.158 --> 16:59.175
Okay.

17:03.014 --> 17:06.665
I have been thinking
for a long time...

17:06.700 --> 17:08.000
Okay, can we speed this up?

17:08.035 --> 17:09.227
'Cause, I can't stand
for too long,

17:09.262 --> 17:13.114
ever since that linebacker slammed
me into that cheerleader.

17:13.149 --> 17:15.558
Then again, that is
how I met your mom.

17:15.593 --> 17:17.885
Well, it's
hard to tell you, but...

17:17.920 --> 17:20.160
I'm William Shakespeare
eating a ham?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.214
Is this about the whole
red meat thing again?

17:24.627 --> 17:26.227
What the heck does that mean?

17:26.262 --> 17:28.161
Xander's situation is
identical to

17:28.197 --> 17:29.346
Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet.</i>

17:29.381 --> 17:31.807
But instead of feeling the
pressure of political ambition,

17:31.842 --> 17:34.442
Xander feels the pressure of his
father's football ambition.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.262
Like, duh!

17:37.148 --> 17:38.839
No. Not like, duh!

17:42.028 --> 17:44.211
Okay, from now on,
you're wearing two helmets.

17:44.247 --> 17:45.967
Can't have you losing
any more brain cells.

17:46.365 --> 17:48.807
What I'm trying to say is...

17:48.843 --> 17:50.043
I don't want to play football.

17:50.836 --> 17:51.836
What?

17:53.197 --> 17:55.014
But we're a football family.

17:55.049 --> 17:56.757
I played,
your grandfather played.

17:56.792 --> 17:59.401
Even your cousin Shelia made
a darn good tackle dummy!

18:01.022 --> 18:03.706
Dad, you're not listening to me.

18:03.741 --> 18:05.390
I'm done with football!

18:05.426 --> 18:07.210
The heck you are!

18:07.245 --> 18:10.037
You know, I am extremely
disappointed in you, Xander.

18:13.635 --> 18:16.560
Well, I'm sorry for being
such a disappointment.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.645
But I'm staying here at camp.
No, you're not!

18:18.681 --> 18:19.881
We're leaving in ten minutes.

18:20.115 --> 18:21.257
Go pack.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.099
Go fish? (LAUGHS)

18:31.260 --> 18:32.260
Got any threes?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.907
Miniature soccer.

18:38.942 --> 18:40.022
Who came up with this?

18:42.163 --> 18:43.163
Gerald! Oh, no!

18:45.858 --> 18:47.618
Hello! Hello, Gladys.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.411
You didn't stop by and say hi

18:50.446 --> 18:52.079
when you dropped off
Xander this summer.

18:52.115 --> 18:53.939
Because last time
I said "hello,"

18:53.974 --> 18:55.290
you handcuffed yourself
to my belt,

18:55.326 --> 18:57.526
and said it was a magic trick.

18:57.629 --> 19:00.763
Abracadabra!

19:00.798 --> 19:03.207
Uh, Gladys!
The nurse wants to see you.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.576
Something about botulism?

19:05.611 --> 19:07.928
Darn it! Stupid rusty
canned beans!

19:07.963 --> 19:11.498
I'll be right back, and I'll
pull something out of your hat.

19:11.533 --> 19:13.533
(MOCK LAUGHS)
I don't have a hat.

19:15.296 --> 19:17.846
(EXHALES) Thanks so
much for saving me...

19:17.881 --> 19:19.548
Emma.

19:19.584 --> 19:23.653
Oh, so you're the famous Emma that
Xander keeps telling me about.

19:23.688 --> 19:26.822
Well, I've been in a few magazines,
but I wouldn't call myself famous.

19:26.857 --> 19:29.633
(BOTH LAUGHING)

19:29.669 --> 19:34.914
Look, Mr. McCormick,
I really care about Xander.

19:34.949 --> 19:37.389
Then I guess you're happy
he wants to stay at camp.

19:37.835 --> 19:39.868
Well, yeah.

19:39.903 --> 19:43.088
But when he first told me he was
leaving, I was really hurt and upset.

19:43.124 --> 19:44.148
Then you understand how I feel?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.699
Of course.

19:45.735 --> 19:50.237
But then Lou helped me realize
that I should want Xander to do

19:50.273 --> 19:52.273
what makes him happy,
even if it makes me upset.

19:53.609 --> 19:56.243
I get it.

19:56.279 --> 19:57.836
You're saying that
if I love Xander,

19:57.871 --> 19:59.351
I should let him
choose his own path?

19:59.916 --> 20:02.849
Exactly.

20:02.885 --> 20:04.765
You know he once got lost
in our driveway?

20:05.254 --> 20:06.254
And it's a circle.

20:07.757 --> 20:08.280
Tell me about it.

20:08.315 --> 20:10.533
When he goes out in the woods,
we make him wear a bell.

20:10.568 --> 20:12.985
(BOTH LAUGHING)

20:13.021 --> 20:15.221
But when it comes to what
he wants to do with his life,

20:16.332 --> 20:18.532
I think you should trust
he knows where he's going.

20:19.143 --> 20:20.676
(SIGHS)

20:20.711 --> 20:22.544
(CHUCKLES) Maybe you're right.

20:22.580 --> 20:23.620
I should go talk to him.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.826
You know, you're a
pretty smart young lady.

20:28.861 --> 20:32.271
And I loved that story you
made up to get rid of Gladys.

20:32.306 --> 20:34.348
I didn't make that up.

20:34.383 --> 20:37.543
Right now, there are 12 kids puking
their guts out in the infirmary.

20:38.679 --> 20:39.679
Hey.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.473
Hey.

20:45.335 --> 20:47.494
Wow, this mattress is hard.

20:47.530 --> 20:50.370
That's because it's plywood
painted to look like a mattress.

20:51.976 --> 20:53.296
I see Gladys is
as cheap as ever.

20:54.370 --> 20:57.921
So... Look, Dad, I don't
want to play football.

20:57.956 --> 20:59.289
I just don't like it.

20:59.325 --> 21:01.725
Well, what do you like?

21:01.761 --> 21:04.241
Being here at camp
and playing music.

21:04.646 --> 21:05.846
But you wouldn't understand.

21:06.649 --> 21:07.673
Actually, I would.

21:09.626 --> 21:13.361
I never told you this... But, uh...
(CLEARS THROAT)

21:13.397 --> 21:14.997
I always wanted to
play the clarinet.

21:16.475 --> 21:17.566
(CHUCKLES) You did?

21:17.601 --> 21:23.038
But the clarinet is so la...
Cool! I know, right?

21:23.073 --> 21:26.534
Every game, I'd look up from the field
at the band with their awesome hats,

21:26.569 --> 21:29.528
watching that clarinet section
blow the crowd away.

21:31.031 --> 21:32.271
Gosh, they were neat!

21:33.776 --> 21:35.096
Then why did you play football?

21:35.828 --> 21:37.068
'Cause my dad made me.

21:38.639 --> 21:41.240
You think I wanted to
wear his old jockstrap?

21:41.275 --> 21:42.755
So you do understand how I feel?

21:43.795 --> 21:46.203
Absolutely.

21:46.238 --> 21:48.438
And you're not a disappointment.

21:48.532 --> 21:49.812
In fact, I'm really
proud of you.

21:50.693 --> 21:51.734
You are?

21:51.769 --> 21:55.369
Yeah, I wish I could've stood up
to my dad like you stood up to me.

21:55.765 --> 21:57.014
Thanks, Dad.

22:02.797 --> 22:05.414
So I can stay at camp?
Of course.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.410
But you do know that
the food here has botulism?

22:09.336 --> 22:10.961
I know, that's why I never
eat anything canned.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.730
(LAUGHING)

22:12.765 --> 22:14.156
Just promise me one thing.

22:14.191 --> 22:17.471
You won't take up soccer, 'cause
I couldn't stand the shame.

22:18.612 --> 22:19.932
Deal. Okay.

22:20.631 --> 22:21.631
(CLAPPING)

22:23.384 --> 22:26.476
Ravi, why are you crying?
He's very emotional.

22:26.512 --> 22:29.430
I once saw him cry
over a commercial.

22:29.432 --> 22:31.792
That man got the fourth
tire for free. (SOBS)

22:35.437 --> 22:39.181
(LAUGHING)

22:39.216 --> 22:41.491
See? The monkey's
sniffing his own butt!

22:41.527 --> 22:43.243
Look! He fell off the branch!

22:43.278 --> 22:45.913
(LAUGHING)

22:45.948 --> 22:48.340
And you're getting me new
pictures of your dad, right?

22:48.376 --> 22:50.117
Mmm-hmm.

22:50.152 --> 22:51.818
Just keep that pudding coming.

22:51.854 --> 22:54.496
I know, doctor's orders.

22:54.531 --> 22:57.107
I'll go get some more.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.543
I was getting up anyway
to gouge my eyes out.

23:04.041 --> 23:05.041
(SCREAMING)

23:06.327 --> 23:07.609
What's wrong?

23:07.644 --> 23:08.764
I found more raccoon parts.

23:11.481 --> 23:17.894
What? They make
great paper weights.
