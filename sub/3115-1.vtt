00:42.732 --> 00:46.540
I believe that there are different
levels of evil in the world.

00:50.975 --> 00:53.343
No rituals, no magic.

00:53.344 --> 00:58.085
It already dwells in all of us...
that's it, that's the battle.

01:04.221 --> 01:09.363
This is war.
There's no neutral ground.

01:21.239 --> 01:23.872
Never, never come up...

01:23.873 --> 01:25.408
Come on.

01:48.531 --> 01:51.938
- Ah!
- Asshole.

01:56.273 --> 02:00.514
No. Ow! Easy, buddy.

02:01.711 --> 02:05.084
Would you relax? Come on.

02:06.783 --> 02:10.386
I don't like being out here.
It creeps me out.

02:10.388 --> 02:12.055
No one asked you to come.

02:12.056 --> 02:15.558
- We're trespassing.
- Do you hear this shit, baby?

02:15.559 --> 02:17.560
What are you afraid of anyways?

02:17.561 --> 02:21.298
Janet Hobbs came out
here five years ago,

02:21.299 --> 02:23.601
went missing, never came back.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.503
Yeah well, Janet Hobbs was a nutjob.

02:25.504 --> 02:28.438
- She wasn't the only one.
- I don't see what the big deal is anyways.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.775
- It's just an old house.
- I think you're just scared.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.810
And I think you're gonna be
finishing all by yourself tonight.

02:33.811 --> 02:37.080
You serious? The Granville
place is haunted.

02:37.081 --> 02:40.083
- What are you guys talking about?
- Martha May?

02:40.084 --> 02:43.352
Crazy chick from the '80s,
possessed by a demon.

02:45.057 --> 02:47.557
S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

02:47.558 --> 02:50.468
It did all kinds of
freaky shit to her.

02:55.465 --> 02:57.304
You are so full of shit.

02:57.305 --> 03:00.631
My mom went to high
school with that lady.

03:00.937 --> 03:04.243
She had an affair with
this guy from across town.

03:05.976 --> 03:08.345
She couldn't handle the guilt.

03:11.047 --> 03:13.587
It drove her crazy.

03:15.486 --> 03:18.695
- I heard she committed suicide out there.
- That's a lie.

03:18.696 --> 03:20.825
Okay, then what really
happened, wise-ass?

03:20.826 --> 03:26.233
The real question is what's
the town hiding from us?

03:31.634 --> 03:33.503
I wanna see it.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.573
No! Forget about it!

03:35.574 --> 03:37.707
Are you out of your mind?

03:37.708 --> 03:39.842
I wanna see what's out there.

03:40.143 --> 03:41.511
Susie, no.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.980
We've grown up with these
stories our whole life.

03:43.981 --> 03:47.550
- Aren't you curious what's out there?
- That's just it, it's just stories.

03:47.551 --> 03:50.388
- There's nothing out there.
- It's like...

03:50.389 --> 03:53.958
It's like a bad place, man.

03:53.959 --> 03:56.158
It's like...

03:56.159 --> 03:59.032
Very bad.

04:05.635 --> 04:08.406
- Susie!
- She'll be dead by morning.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.640
Hello?

05:17.707 --> 05:21.047
This place is freakin' creepy.

05:23.747 --> 05:26.686
What the hell is this shit?

05:27.717 --> 05:31.749
Are you joking?
I mean this is freakin' weird.

05:33.224 --> 05:35.226
- Who the hell would even live here?
- Hey hey.

05:35.227 --> 05:36.893
- I mean...
- Hey, hey, hey!

05:36.894 --> 05:38.695
We're finally alone now.

05:38.696 --> 05:42.001
You promised.

05:49.172 --> 05:50.740
That's too rough for me.

05:50.741 --> 05:53.279
It's too rough for me.

05:55.845 --> 05:58.718
Something doesn't feel right.

06:01.084 --> 06:02.285
Nathan?

06:02.286 --> 06:04.020
Nathan!

06:04.021 --> 06:06.393
Nathan?!

06:16.000 --> 06:18.300
Nathan?

06:18.301 --> 06:20.873
Nathan.

07:30.501 --> 07:32.300
Our new deputy from San Francisco?

07:32.301 --> 07:34.344
- Sheriff Hendricks, right?
- Yeah, we spoke on the phone.

07:34.345 --> 07:36.312
I'm Michael Brodie,
this is my wife Rachel.

07:36.313 --> 07:38.648
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi. You too.

07:38.649 --> 07:39.953
Have any trouble finding us?

07:39.954 --> 07:42.252
Your town doesn't really
appear on most maps.

07:42.253 --> 07:45.511
It's always hard to see what's
right in front of your face.

07:46.955 --> 07:50.393
I'm... I'm just messin' with you.
Not even on most maps.

07:50.394 --> 07:52.362
Listen, I... uh, I...
I really appreciate

07:52.363 --> 07:54.130
what you're doing here.

07:54.131 --> 07:55.965
Oh yeah, glad to help, glad to help.

07:55.966 --> 07:59.701
It's not every day we get
a big-city detective here.

07:59.702 --> 08:01.638
The truth is my deputy
bailed town last minute,

08:01.639 --> 08:03.973
so I was bound to hire the
first person that called.

08:05.274 --> 08:08.912
Most folks who come here are
usually running from something.

08:08.913 --> 08:11.448
That or they got no place else to go.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.150
I'm not running from anything.
We're just looking for something new.

08:14.151 --> 08:16.986
Ain't we all? Ain't we all?

08:16.987 --> 08:19.823
Anyway, winter months are
usually pretty quiet here.

08:19.824 --> 08:21.424
Population just under a thousand.

08:21.425 --> 08:24.194
We're just simple
folk really, just...

08:24.195 --> 08:25.895
It's the way I like to keep it.

08:25.896 --> 08:29.002
All right.

08:34.104 --> 08:36.438
It's really amazing.

08:41.344 --> 08:44.314
Ugh. All right, this is the place.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.316
There you go.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.851
Thank you.

08:47.852 --> 08:50.887
- You're welcome.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

08:50.888 --> 08:53.356
Yeah, this is one of
our summer rentals.

08:53.357 --> 08:55.759
Uh, the family doesn't
come up till June

08:55.760 --> 08:58.261
so you guys are welcome to
use it until you find a place.

08:58.262 --> 09:00.363
Okay, thank you.

09:00.364 --> 09:03.099
Uniform, gun, badge.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.335
All right, I guess I'll
leave you guys alone.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.137
- Let you get settled in.
- Thank you.

09:07.138 --> 09:09.005
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, welcome.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.940
Um, I'll pick you up in the morning?

09:10.941 --> 09:14.213
- Yeah.
- Welcome to Glenwood Bay.

09:20.342 --> 09:24.424
- Well, here we go.
- Here we go.

10:44.300 --> 10:48.007
- I made us breakfast.
- Yeah.

10:54.443 --> 10:56.246
This is Mike.

10:56.247 --> 10:58.583
Uh-huh.

11:00.483 --> 11:03.488
What do you normally do?

11:03.586 --> 11:05.555
Really?

11:06.356 --> 11:10.193
No, okay, I'll be there.
I'll leave right now.

11:11.929 --> 11:14.030
What was that about?

11:14.031 --> 11:15.598
It was Hendricks.

11:15.599 --> 11:19.301
First day on the job,
already a missing person.

11:19.302 --> 11:22.205
I thought maybe we could
have breakfast together.

11:22.206 --> 11:24.574
I'm sorry, Rach, you know
there's a missing person.

11:24.575 --> 11:28.046
I'm already late.

11:28.945 --> 11:31.484
Mmmm.

11:39.055 --> 11:42.028
Have a good day.

13:04.941 --> 13:08.081
Hello?

13:08.945 --> 13:11.249
Hello.

13:11.580 --> 13:14.454
Are you okay?

13:19.456 --> 13:24.497
My husband and I live in
the house over there.

13:25.227 --> 13:29.465
I shouldn't be here.
My sister left me here.

13:29.466 --> 13:31.967
I have to go.

13:31.968 --> 13:36.209
Wait up. Hold up. Let me just...

13:37.006 --> 13:38.641
...help you.

13:55.492 --> 13:57.426
So who's the missing person?

13:57.427 --> 13:59.462
Some local teen girl.

13:59.463 --> 14:03.835
It's weird. It's not every day
we get to do real police work.

14:04.601 --> 14:07.436
- Yeah, what's that?
- That?

14:07.437 --> 14:09.638
The lily among thorns.

14:09.639 --> 14:12.708
It's a shield to those
who walk in integrity,

14:12.709 --> 14:14.778
guarding the paths of justice and...

14:14.779 --> 14:16.679
And watching over
the way of his saints.

14:16.680 --> 14:20.453
It's proverbs 2,
verse seven and eight.

14:22.118 --> 14:23.787
You a religious man?

14:23.788 --> 14:26.822
God-fearing. You?

14:27.823 --> 14:29.224
No.

14:29.225 --> 14:31.531
Not anymore.

14:32.128 --> 14:33.729
I really don't see the point.

14:33.730 --> 14:37.570
Every man for himself in my opinion.

14:37.733 --> 14:40.735
That's a lonely way of thinking, son.

14:40.736 --> 14:42.671
Your choice.

14:42.672 --> 14:44.944
I care about this town.

14:45.809 --> 14:47.343
The good lord has burdened my heart

14:47.344 --> 14:50.216
and I see it as my
duty to protect 'em.

14:56.352 --> 15:01.460
Susie went out night before
last and she hasn't come home.

15:02.425 --> 15:05.093
Was she alone?

15:05.095 --> 15:08.596
There was a party or something. I...

15:08.597 --> 15:11.571
I don't know where they went.

15:13.069 --> 15:15.942
I told her we couldn't afford it.

15:16.439 --> 15:17.740
Hey.

15:17.742 --> 15:20.076
It's okay, Margo.

15:20.077 --> 15:21.710
Go ahead.

15:21.711 --> 15:24.080
She wants to go to the university.

15:24.081 --> 15:26.082
I told her we couldn't
afford it, she stormed out

15:26.083 --> 15:27.751
and that's the last time I saw her.

15:27.752 --> 15:30.653
I've been working at Wayne
Fleener's, the graveyard shift,

15:30.654 --> 15:33.123
and I've been saving every
penny that I can and I...

15:33.124 --> 15:35.895
It's just...

15:36.625 --> 15:39.899
Do you mind if I keep this?

15:40.096 --> 15:43.258
Can you tell me if she has
a boyfriend, a best friend?

15:43.260 --> 15:47.103
Uh, yeah. There's this
kid Nathan Miller.

15:47.104 --> 15:49.184
- She knows I don't approve.
- And why is that?

15:49.185 --> 15:54.981
'Cause he's got one thing on his mind and
Susie's not very good at telling him no.

15:55.145 --> 15:57.414
She's dead, isn't she?

15:57.415 --> 16:02.118
No. No, no, no, no. Let's don't
jump to conclusions, okay?

16:02.119 --> 16:05.024
I'm sure she's fine.

16:11.795 --> 16:17.637
I used to speak with someone in
San Francisco, but I'm fine.

16:17.766 --> 16:21.641
My husband, he insisted
I come see you.

16:24.874 --> 16:28.645
Our daughter was killed in an
accident a few months ago.

16:28.646 --> 16:32.318
What happen to her?

17:01.177 --> 17:05.017
Your daughter has been
a huge part of your life.

17:05.214 --> 17:07.782
If you weren't thrown
off-guard by this,

17:07.784 --> 17:09.885
then something would be wrong.

17:09.886 --> 17:12.489
My husband blames me for her death.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.694
Have you forgiven yourself?

17:16.192 --> 17:18.294
Things haven't been the same since.

17:18.295 --> 17:19.863
He won't talk to me.

17:19.864 --> 17:25.103
He won't touch me. He...
He's married to his job.

17:25.935 --> 17:28.974
He doesn't care.

17:29.638 --> 17:31.975
I thought moving here
would change things.

17:31.976 --> 17:33.842
And why did you move here?

17:33.843 --> 17:39.418
We needed a change and
Michael let me decide.

18:14.918 --> 18:18.758
I went to see Dr. Farnell today.

18:19.955 --> 18:22.595
Are you taking your meds?

18:23.692 --> 18:26.531
They make me numb.

19:31.861 --> 19:34.431
Who was the last person to see her?

19:34.432 --> 19:36.965
Are you the new guy?
You're kinda cute.

19:36.966 --> 19:39.002
Miss Wilcox.

19:39.003 --> 19:41.503
Miller-comma-Nathan, her boyfriend.

19:41.504 --> 19:44.106
- They left the party early.
- Yeah, where was the party?

19:44.107 --> 19:46.009
Campfire in the forest,
near the old Gra...

19:46.010 --> 19:50.080
It was nothing,
Mr. Police-officer-man. Nothing.

19:50.081 --> 19:52.514
Was there drugs, huh?
Booze? Having a good time?

19:52.515 --> 19:55.684
- We don't kiss and tell.
- They're... they're fine, man.

19:55.685 --> 19:57.586
We don't know anything.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.788
Sheriff Hendricks, I mean,
you have to believe us.

19:59.789 --> 20:01.558
Where were they going?

20:01.559 --> 20:03.660
What's a man like you doing
in this hick town anyway?

20:03.661 --> 20:05.527
- Miss Wilcox!
- Nowhere else to go?

20:05.528 --> 20:07.996
- Why don't you answer the question?
- Hell if I know.

20:07.997 --> 20:09.631
- Susie didn't tell me.
- You don't know, huh?

20:09.632 --> 20:13.538
- I don't know.
- I think you're lying.

20:54.411 --> 20:57.616
Hello?

21:04.052 --> 21:07.189
You and Susie Dudley, as I
understand, were very good friends?

21:07.190 --> 21:09.725
A lot of history there?

21:09.726 --> 21:13.695
- Did something happen to Susie?
- You tell me.

21:13.696 --> 21:16.932
- Are you suggesting that I'm keeping...
- What I'm suggesting is maybe

21:16.933 --> 21:20.039
her disappearance
is disturbing to you.

21:21.069 --> 21:23.472
But this is totally like Susie.

21:23.473 --> 21:25.955
- What are you talking about?
- She's always running away.

21:25.956 --> 21:28.744
She and her mom were always at it.
I didn't think it was a big deal.

21:28.745 --> 21:32.079
I'm sure she's fine.

21:32.080 --> 21:35.652
- Just wants the attention.
- Where's her boyfriend Nathan?

21:35.653 --> 21:39.054
- I'll go pull him from class.
- Yeah.

21:39.055 --> 21:43.158
So tell me about Friday night?
Susie's mom said there was a party?

21:43.159 --> 21:46.545
- Yeah, we went to the bowling alley.
- You're lying to me!

21:47.067 --> 21:49.833
Okay, your friends told me there
was a campfire by the woods.

21:49.834 --> 21:51.733
- Why are you lying?!
- It was nothing.

21:51.734 --> 21:53.068
Then why lie about it?

21:53.069 --> 21:55.804
Miss Cook.

21:55.805 --> 21:58.575
If you want to keep on track with
attending that Ivy League school,

21:58.576 --> 22:00.844
- I'd advise you to answer thi...
- It was just this senior-year thing

22:00.845 --> 22:02.561
with a few of us hanging
out in the woods.

22:02.562 --> 22:04.955
It didn't go anywhere else?

22:05.790 --> 22:07.882
No, sir.

22:07.883 --> 22:10.655
Can I go back to class now?

22:17.126 --> 22:22.197
Eh, you know there's no need to scare
the hell out of these kids, Michael.

22:22.198 --> 22:23.967
Just following your advice, huh?

22:23.968 --> 22:26.802
- And our duty to protect this town.
- Murder?

22:26.803 --> 22:29.037
Michael, we haven't had that kind
of trouble here in a long time.

22:29.038 --> 22:31.153
Look, people talk,
especially these kids.

22:31.155 --> 22:34.310
Last thing I want is a
panic you understand?

22:35.979 --> 22:38.113
Listen, I don't know
what that was all about,

22:38.114 --> 22:40.816
but, uh, we got another problem.

22:40.817 --> 22:44.156
Nathan Miller didn't
show up for class today.

24:08.705 --> 24:11.273
Some local fisherman
found him naked,

24:11.274 --> 24:15.615
curled up on a bank this morning.
They brought him here.

24:18.380 --> 24:20.916
- Where are his folks?
- Both deceased.

24:20.917 --> 24:23.620
- The boy lives with his grandmother.
- Hey hey hey.

24:23.621 --> 24:26.054
Hey hey, she drowned.
Sh-she... she drowned.

24:26.055 --> 24:27.991
She drowned, she drowned,
she drowned, she drowned.

24:27.992 --> 24:30.292
Is she dead? She drowned!
She drowned.

24:30.293 --> 24:32.629
She drowned, I hear
she did. I don't know.

24:32.630 --> 24:35.164
- She drowned, she drowned!
- What'd you say?

24:35.165 --> 24:36.799
She drowned!

24:36.800 --> 24:38.801
She drowned!

24:38.802 --> 24:40.402
She drowned.

24:40.403 --> 24:42.005
Hey, he does this every single day.

24:42.006 --> 24:44.206
She drowned.

24:44.207 --> 24:47.342
A house divided upon itself

24:47.343 --> 24:51.146
will fall into wrack and ruin.

24:51.147 --> 24:55.250
In the great abyss the
seven princesses dwell!

24:55.251 --> 24:57.820
It's a trick, it's a trick!
Th... they're fakin' ya.

24:57.821 --> 24:59.888
They-they want to
reach out from hell.

24:59.889 --> 25:03.292
Bring you back.
Bring you back to hell!

25:03.293 --> 25:06.762
Drag you into hell-lll...

25:06.763 --> 25:08.864
- All right!
- Hell...

25:08.865 --> 25:10.399
Lovely town you got here.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.135
Like I said, he does that every day.

25:13.136 --> 25:15.507
Here's our boy.

25:16.338 --> 25:18.440
Hasn't said a word
since he's been here.

25:18.441 --> 25:21.813
Completely unresponsive.

25:22.311 --> 25:25.681
Any blood, bruises or
anything like that?

25:25.682 --> 25:28.186
Not a trace.

25:28.250 --> 25:31.289
Something scared the hell out of him.

25:49.438 --> 25:51.443
Hey, Nathan.

25:53.775 --> 25:56.078
Hey, Nathan,
it's Sheriff Hendricks here.

25:56.079 --> 25:59.081
We've got a few questions
we'd like to ask you.

25:59.082 --> 26:01.717
You remember anything at
all about the other night

26:01.718 --> 26:04.956
in the woods with Susie Dudley?

26:08.390 --> 26:10.292
You know where she is?

26:10.293 --> 26:13.332
Nathan?

26:13.729 --> 26:16.435
Nathan!

26:23.438 --> 26:26.578
Possibility he might
be faking, doctor?

26:27.242 --> 26:29.511
That's highly doubtful.

26:29.512 --> 26:33.485
Yeah, but is there a possibility?

26:35.751 --> 26:37.386
W... Well...

26:37.387 --> 26:41.425
Of course there's
a possibility, but...

26:43.325 --> 26:48.396
"Revertar in domum meam unde exivi."

26:48.397 --> 26:52.137
- What the hell's he doing?
- I-I don't...

27:07.216 --> 27:09.615
No, no! No, no, don't cuff him,
don't cuff him! It's too early!

27:09.616 --> 27:11.220
Shaw, either help or get
the hell out of here.

27:11.221 --> 27:12.521
I'm just trying to do my job!

27:12.522 --> 27:15.127
Get him up.

27:21.529 --> 27:26.101
I've got all day, son.
Where is Susie Dudley?

27:26.102 --> 27:30.839
Why don't you just tell
me now? Nathan! Hey!

27:30.840 --> 27:34.510
Susie Dudley... where is she?

27:34.511 --> 27:37.813
I wanna know where she is.

27:37.814 --> 27:42.954
"Revertar in domum meam unde exivi."

27:43.819 --> 27:48.026
All right, you listen to me,
you little shit! Huh?

27:48.027 --> 27:51.827
Did you see something?
You tell me what happened to her.

27:51.828 --> 27:55.734
- You tell me. I need to know!
- Brodie!

27:56.598 --> 27:58.737
Ease off.

28:12.881 --> 28:17.589
You know, son, finding Susie Dudley's
not gonna bring your daughter back.

28:17.619 --> 28:19.588
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

28:19.589 --> 28:22.090
It just means there's some
things in this damned life

28:22.092 --> 28:24.092
you're not in control of.

28:24.094 --> 28:26.061
You want me to write that down?

28:26.062 --> 28:29.096
I think you're forgetting
whose operation this is.

28:29.897 --> 28:31.467
Your game's a joke.

28:31.468 --> 28:34.369
- What is it you're after, son?
- I want the truth.

28:34.370 --> 28:38.506
You chase the truth like
a radical crusader.

28:38.507 --> 28:40.943
- I know what I'm doing.
- Do you?

28:40.944 --> 28:43.149
Yeah.

28:47.049 --> 28:48.550
Why don't you explain to me

28:48.551 --> 28:52.624
why some punk kid's speaking
in a dead language.

29:16.111 --> 29:20.052
"Sad mouse lives in this house."

29:58.119 --> 30:01.623
<i>Sad mouse lives in this house</i>

30:01.624 --> 30:04.993
<i>Sad mouse lives in this house...</i>

30:07.596 --> 30:11.232
<i>Sad mouse lives in this house</i>

30:11.233 --> 30:15.003
<i>Sad mouse lives in this house...</i>

30:34.423 --> 30:37.762
<i>Sad mouse lives in...</i>

31:57.840 --> 32:00.745
Hello?

33:38.806 --> 33:42.845
Revertar in domum meam unde exivi.

33:44.563 --> 33:48.162
Revertar in domum meam unde exivi.

33:59.928 --> 34:02.730
Welcome back. Reporter Brennyn Danae

34:02.731 --> 34:05.934
has been follow the case
of a local missing student.

34:05.935 --> 34:08.871
She is live at the location
where she was last seen.

34:08.871 --> 34:11.206
- Brennyn.
- The small town of Glenwood Bay

34:11.206 --> 34:13.474
is still on the lookout
for missing teenager

34:13.475 --> 34:16.578
Susie Dudley, 18 years old,
who disappeared two days ago.

34:16.579 --> 34:18.880
Authorities have yet
to issue a statement,

34:18.882 --> 34:21.350
but our sources tell us that
no arrest has been made.

34:21.351 --> 34:24.353
Sheriff Hendricks is keeping all
the details in house for now

34:24.353 --> 34:27.659
but a statement should
be made later today.

34:38.734 --> 34:41.772
Michael.

34:43.404 --> 34:44.938
Rachel?

34:44.940 --> 34:47.545
What are you doing here?

34:48.509 --> 34:49.978
- Hey.
- I saw...

34:49.978 --> 34:52.246
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing here?

34:54.284 --> 34:56.684
I met a little girl.

34:56.685 --> 34:58.454
I followed her out to the woods.

34:59.989 --> 35:01.956
A little girl?

35:01.957 --> 35:04.259
Why don't I like where this is going?

35:04.260 --> 35:05.928
Listen to me!

35:05.929 --> 35:07.996
I watched her die.

35:07.997 --> 35:11.069
Wait a minute.

35:14.369 --> 35:16.771
You tell me, was it this little girl?

35:16.772 --> 35:20.612
- No.
- Who was it, Mrs. Brodie?

35:24.210 --> 35:26.314
I don't know.

35:26.315 --> 35:29.284
It was out in this
house in the woods.

35:29.285 --> 35:32.089
Michael, did you see this girl?

35:32.955 --> 35:35.493
No.

35:37.825 --> 35:42.498
Rachel, are you sure that
you saw a little girl?

35:42.499 --> 35:43.499
Michael!

35:43.500 --> 35:46.604
Yes, I am sure!

35:47.503 --> 35:50.442
Do something!

36:04.552 --> 36:06.654
What is this place, huh?

36:06.655 --> 36:08.856
Just some old house.

36:08.857 --> 36:10.893
Had a suicide case awhile back.

36:10.894 --> 36:13.961
About the biggest thing to
happened in Glenwood Bay.

36:13.962 --> 36:17.168
Ain't been no trouble in years.

36:17.965 --> 36:21.505
It was right here.

36:21.669 --> 36:24.943
She was right here.

36:25.707 --> 36:28.343
I saw it in the mirror.

36:28.344 --> 36:31.421
She was lying here on the ground and
there was blood everywhere and...

36:31.423 --> 36:35.616
and... and she...
She was just lying here

36:35.617 --> 36:37.653
and she couldn't do anything.

36:37.654 --> 36:40.725
There's nothing here.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.998
Can I talk to you?

36:52.633 --> 36:55.436
- Are you sure you saw something?
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.

36:55.437 --> 36:57.004
- I'm sure.
- Rachel.

36:57.005 --> 36:58.806
I'm sure.

36:58.807 --> 37:02.813
I'm sure. I promise.

39:45.873 --> 39:50.711
I've wandered through the
desert and found no rest.

39:50.712 --> 39:56.020
"Swept and garnished,
but still empty."

40:00.788 --> 40:03.227
Hello?

40:08.329 --> 40:10.933
Revertar in domum

40:10.934 --> 40:15.473
meam unde exivi.

40:30.219 --> 40:32.688
What the hell are you doing, huh?

40:33.989 --> 40:35.989
Rachel!

40:35.990 --> 40:38.796
- Rachel.
- Nothing!

40:39.727 --> 40:41.330
Nothing.

40:41.331 --> 40:43.369
Who is she?

40:46.801 --> 40:50.137
I don't know. She seemed scared.

40:50.139 --> 40:52.910
Scared of you?

40:53.207 --> 40:56.313
Why would she be scared of me?

40:56.844 --> 41:00.217
- Of what then?
- I don't know.

41:00.314 --> 41:03.821
Do I look nuts to you?

41:03.885 --> 41:07.892
What is it you're hiding,
Mrs. Brodie?

41:12.126 --> 41:14.331
I can't do this.

41:14.630 --> 41:18.402
I-I-I'm sorry. I tried.

41:29.810 --> 41:31.912
Look at you. Look at you.
Look at you.

41:31.913 --> 41:36.317
All scrubbed and garnished,
but you still ain't clean.

41:36.318 --> 41:40.922
No, no, no, you can't dig up the
truth if you want to play the game.

41:40.923 --> 41:43.758
It's all lies. Lies!

41:43.759 --> 41:47.798
There's a resurrection of the mind.

42:03.978 --> 42:05.847
Susie Dudley's still missing.

42:05.848 --> 42:09.116
I heard her boyfriend Nathan done it.

42:09.118 --> 42:13.891
I heard he went crazy. My
daughter's friend told her about it.

42:25.900 --> 42:28.202
Well, Sheriff Hendricks
ain't saying a word,

42:28.203 --> 42:31.339
but I heard someone saw Susie

42:31.340 --> 42:33.774
sneaking around the
old Granville place.

42:33.775 --> 42:38.412
I'll tell you what, something
ain't right about that house.

42:38.413 --> 42:40.181
Devil's playground.

42:40.182 --> 42:42.783
There's something evil out there.

42:42.785 --> 42:46.557
It's cursed and it always will be.

42:50.024 --> 42:54.865
Revertar in domum meam unde exivi.

42:57.999 --> 42:59.467
What does it mean?

42:59.468 --> 43:04.041
"I will return to my house
from which I came."

43:04.939 --> 43:07.375
He's talking about unclean spirits.

43:07.376 --> 43:10.114
Unclean spirits?

43:10.478 --> 43:13.314
You really believe
in this hocus-pocus?

43:13.315 --> 43:15.283
The house he's referring
to is the body.

43:15.284 --> 43:17.919
The demon returning to the
place where it once dwelled,

43:17.920 --> 43:21.959
- but only if it's an empty vessel.
- An empty vessel?

43:23.958 --> 43:26.260
Souls.

43:26.261 --> 43:28.462
Luke 11, verse 26,

43:28.464 --> 43:31.899
the demon goes and gets seven
other spirits more evil than itself,

43:31.900 --> 43:34.168
and they enter and dwell
within the vacant soul.

43:34.169 --> 43:38.008
The person ends up far worse
than they were before.

43:43.110 --> 43:46.384
You ever see anything like this?

43:49.415 --> 43:51.222
No.

43:59.328 --> 44:03.164
S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A. S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

44:03.165 --> 44:05.533
- S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.
- Protect us.

44:05.534 --> 44:07.835
"Against the spirits of
wickedness in high places."

44:07.836 --> 44:10.338
Touch my body. Taste it.

44:10.339 --> 44:13.440
"You will not surely die."

44:16.812 --> 44:19.579
You are weak.

44:21.404 --> 44:25.121
Father Callahan? Father Callahan.

44:27.322 --> 44:30.428
What do you make of that?

44:33.461 --> 44:37.530
I believe that there are different
levels of evil in the world.

44:37.532 --> 44:39.966
No rituals, no magic.

44:40.267 --> 44:44.575
It already dwells in all of us.
That's it. That's the battle.

44:45.540 --> 44:47.542
This is war.

44:47.543 --> 44:50.347
There's no neutral ground.

45:08.495 --> 45:11.369
"Bethy Banks."

46:03.651 --> 46:07.391
Probably make it easier
if you talked about it.

46:08.555 --> 46:10.024
Nothing.

46:10.025 --> 46:12.527
Rachel just likes to rattle my cage.

46:12.528 --> 46:14.962
Mmm. From what I saw last night,

46:14.963 --> 46:17.064
it looked like something
was rattling hers.

46:17.065 --> 46:20.567
She blames herself for
our daughter's death.

46:20.568 --> 46:23.339
Who do you blame?

46:28.643 --> 46:34.200
You see good people get shit on
all the time and he lets it happen.

46:36.416 --> 46:38.652
So I say to hell with him.

46:38.653 --> 46:41.088
What good people, Michael?

46:41.089 --> 46:45.355
There's always been good
and evil. That's the game.

46:45.669 --> 46:47.807
The curse.

46:49.297 --> 46:53.704
But really who is innocent when
standing here before the almighty?

46:55.703 --> 46:59.306
We all face the enemy
every single day.

46:59.307 --> 47:01.709
Just exiles wandering around.

47:01.710 --> 47:06.213
You're angry. Understandable.

47:06.214 --> 47:09.153
Don't make it worse by
nursing your grudge.

47:09.217 --> 47:12.690
Otherwise you give a mighty
foothold to the enemy.

47:43.251 --> 47:47.688
"When an evil spirit
comes out of a man,

47:47.689 --> 47:51.658
it goes through arid
places seeking rest.

47:51.659 --> 47:54.694
It does not find it.

47:54.695 --> 47:56.397
And then it says,

47:56.398 --> 47:58.699
'I will return to the house

47:58.700 --> 48:03.741
from which I came.'"

49:07.368 --> 49:12.106
Clear cause of death was
severed arteries to the abdomen.

49:12.107 --> 49:16.810
Severe trauma to the abdominal cavity.
The blade was thick and went deep.

49:16.811 --> 49:18.779
Any sign of rape?

49:18.780 --> 49:23.117
Autopsy shows signs of semen,
along with severe vaginal tearing.

49:23.118 --> 49:27.821
I won't have the DNA match back
for a few more days, but I, uh,

49:27.822 --> 49:31.795
I did find these
markings to be very odd.

49:34.761 --> 49:35.796
Oh my God.

49:35.798 --> 49:41.038
"S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A."

50:00.320 --> 50:02.792
Sheriff?

50:02.890 --> 50:06.362
Hendricks!

50:06.828 --> 50:08.930
"The adversary of
iniquity prowls around

50:08.931 --> 50:12.870
like a roaring lion,
seeking someone to devour."

50:14.868 --> 50:16.571
Not this time.

50:19.707 --> 50:24.177
Gather your hearts. We're about to stand
against the schemes of the wicked.

52:26.501 --> 52:28.302
Miss Dudley.

52:28.303 --> 52:30.671
What's happened? Where's...

52:30.672 --> 52:31.905
Where's Jed?

52:31.906 --> 52:34.711
What happened?

52:35.008 --> 52:37.844
- Susie.
- Is she okay?

52:37.845 --> 52:40.081
No. Sh...

52:40.082 --> 52:42.316
She's gone.

52:42.317 --> 52:45.719
- She's dead.
- No.

52:45.720 --> 52:48.158
No, you're...

52:48.523 --> 52:50.561
you're lying.

52:53.728 --> 52:57.233
I want you to know I am so sorry.

53:03.869 --> 53:07.211
Where did you find her?

53:09.976 --> 53:13.484
We had to pull her out of...

53:16.616 --> 53:19.685
Did she suffer?

53:19.686 --> 53:21.121
I'm sorry.

53:21.122 --> 53:24.228
I'm sorry.

53:25.126 --> 53:28.499
Do you know who did this?

53:32.966 --> 53:35.239
Nathan.

54:19.514 --> 54:22.717
I want you to know right here and now

54:22.718 --> 54:26.256
that whatever it is...

54:26.454 --> 54:28.422
that... that you're going through,

54:28.423 --> 54:32.029
I'm gonna be there for you.

54:33.059 --> 54:36.065
I am.

55:16.002 --> 55:17.971
What the hell are you doing?

55:17.972 --> 55:19.739
You're nothing.

55:19.740 --> 55:21.741
You're not a man.

55:21.742 --> 55:23.945
- Rachel, that's not funny.
- You...

55:23.946 --> 55:27.682
let your household fall.

55:27.683 --> 55:30.146
- Okay, Rachel, stop this, huh?
- What's gotten into you?

55:30.148 --> 55:34.821
We were never enough.
Emily needed a father.

55:34.822 --> 55:36.656
- Rachel, that's enough.
- You killed her!

55:36.657 --> 55:39.225
- Hey!
- You killed your baby girl.

55:39.226 --> 55:42.131
Do not say something like that!

55:43.029 --> 55:44.831
You're a fake.

55:44.832 --> 55:49.202
- What the hell's wrong with you, huh?
- Give yourself up for her! Cleanse her!

55:49.203 --> 55:54.509
Sanctify her by washing
her of water with the word.

55:54.510 --> 55:58.845
Never has one hated their own flesh.

55:58.846 --> 56:00.914
Hold fast.

56:00.915 --> 56:03.216
- One flesh.
- Stop this, huh?!

56:03.217 --> 56:05.785
Lies and tricks.

56:05.786 --> 56:09.893
You deceitful bastard.

56:22.068 --> 56:25.006
Stop it! Stop it.

56:25.007 --> 56:29.145
Get out of here. Get out of here!

56:29.309 --> 56:32.812
You're not welcome!
You're not welcome!

56:32.813 --> 56:35.315
You're not wel...

56:36.316 --> 56:38.286
Stop it.

56:38.287 --> 56:40.987
Stop it!

56:46.626 --> 56:49.161
Stop it.

57:06.346 --> 57:09.452
I should've stood by her side.

57:11.052 --> 57:14.224
I should've listened to her.

57:15.622 --> 57:18.059
I can't explain what I saw.

57:20.329 --> 57:23.929
I don't even know if I
believe it myself, but...

57:23.930 --> 57:26.870
I know I can't control it.

57:29.236 --> 57:32.509
The mind's a prison
of your own making.

57:33.106 --> 57:35.308
Funny thing about
that little fella...

57:35.309 --> 57:39.112
so small to be carrying all
that weight by himself.

57:39.113 --> 57:42.051
Yeah, but he's still carrying it.

57:42.617 --> 57:45.756
You love your wife, Michael?

57:46.219 --> 57:49.259
Show her.

57:54.729 --> 57:57.233
It just ain't right.

57:57.732 --> 58:01.838
The man's been through
hell and back with his wife.

58:01.968 --> 58:04.838
- His wife?
- I'd listen to him.

58:04.839 --> 58:07.477
What are you talking about?

58:07.974 --> 58:09.976
It probably ain't my place to say.

58:10.377 --> 58:15.048
This town is full of secrets.
We're all just creatures of habit.

58:15.049 --> 58:20.290
We don't look to right our wrongs.
We just... We just live with them.

59:06.900 --> 59:10.403
Have you noticed any strange
patterns with your wife?

59:10.404 --> 59:13.340
Fits? Blackouts?

59:13.341 --> 59:16.112
Self-mutilations?

59:35.463 --> 59:37.430
Your wife wrote that phrase...

59:37.431 --> 59:40.103
20 years ago.

59:43.436 --> 59:45.438
She was a patient here.

59:45.439 --> 59:48.842
I-I was just an intern,
but I'll never forget it.

59:48.843 --> 59:52.846
We brought her in and we
observed her very closely...

59:52.847 --> 59:55.048
Blanch Rachel Banks.

01:00:01.221 --> 01:00:04.357
This is bullshit. You're both...
you're both full of shit.

01:00:04.358 --> 01:00:07.297
The both of you, you're full of shit!

01:00:08.962 --> 01:00:13.400
We get so tangled in our
regrets of the past.

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:16.836
We think we can just bury it forever,

01:00:16.838 --> 01:00:19.406
create a new identity, start over.

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:22.979
But the truth...

01:00:23.076 --> 01:00:25.949
will surface.

01:00:26.813 --> 01:00:30.417
- I dare you to go inside, Bethy.
- Mom said not to go inside.

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:33.787
- You're such a mama's girl.
- No, I'm not.

01:00:33.788 --> 01:00:36.259
I hate you!

01:00:36.456 --> 01:00:39.996
Blanch, Blanch, no!

01:00:59.412 --> 01:01:03.186
Where is your sister... Beth?

01:01:03.483 --> 01:01:06.623
Am I my sister's keeper?

01:01:08.989 --> 01:01:11.458
Why are you angry?

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:16.595
If you do what is right,
will you not be accepted?

01:01:16.596 --> 01:01:18.899
Where is your sister?

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.502
Her blood cries out to
me from the ground.

01:01:23.504 --> 01:01:27.377
No, leave me alone, please!

01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:45.058
No, no, no, no, no.

01:01:45.059 --> 01:01:47.394
Rachel, Rachel.

01:01:47.395 --> 01:01:49.963
This can't be...

01:01:49.964 --> 01:01:53.136
this can't be happening.

01:01:55.068 --> 01:01:57.373
It's an anagram.

01:02:06.379 --> 01:02:08.281
"Asmodeus."

01:02:08.282 --> 01:02:10.083
From the book of Enoch.

01:02:10.084 --> 01:02:13.723
It's a Hebrew word which
means "to destroy."

01:02:15.255 --> 01:02:19.359
Asmodeus is referred to as one
of the seven princes of hell.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.331
A fallen angel cast down to the
earth from the war in heaven.

01:02:24.332 --> 01:02:28.902
A... a demon of lust,
hate and jealousy,

01:02:28.903 --> 01:02:34.110
responsible for
twisting men's desires.

01:02:36.643 --> 01:02:39.178
The cops never found her body.

01:02:39.179 --> 01:02:41.348
What body?

01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:45.318
When the police discovered your wife
she was inside an abandoned home,

01:02:45.319 --> 01:02:47.621
shaking uncontrollably.

01:02:47.622 --> 01:02:53.292
We brought her in and we
observed her very carefully.

01:02:53.293 --> 01:02:57.130
She didn't speak for weeks.

01:02:57.131 --> 01:03:01.501
And when she finally did talk,
she said that her sister Bethy

01:03:01.502 --> 01:03:05.707
had been raped and killed.

01:03:06.606 --> 01:03:09.546
She was lying.

01:03:21.254 --> 01:03:24.494
Blanch, this isn't funny.

01:03:28.662 --> 01:03:31.366
Blanch!

01:03:56.423 --> 01:03:59.294
Shhh.

01:05:02.756 --> 01:05:04.690
Are... are you telling
me that my wife

01:05:04.691 --> 01:05:08.428
- is possessed by a...
- The mind is a powerful thing.

01:05:08.429 --> 01:05:13.436
She did everything she
could to block it out.

01:05:34.287 --> 01:05:37.392
Hendricks!

01:05:50.636 --> 01:05:53.775
Son of a bitch.

01:06:20.133 --> 01:06:22.939
My God. What happened?

01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:27.340
We're all just creatures of habit.

01:06:27.341 --> 01:06:29.809
I... I wanted her.

01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:33.850
We grasp onto it.

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.551
Capable of

01:06:37.552 --> 01:06:39.386
anything.

01:06:39.387 --> 01:06:42.724
I couldn't stop myself.

01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:46.927
Don't touch me!

01:06:46.928 --> 01:06:49.763
Nathan, Nathan!

01:06:49.764 --> 01:06:52.702
Please! Get off me!

01:06:55.132 --> 01:06:56.840
Don't!

01:06:58.471 --> 01:07:02.312
I can't live with
myself for what I did.

01:07:02.542 --> 01:07:05.615
I killed her.

01:08:22.321 --> 01:08:23.956
Hendricks?

01:08:23.957 --> 01:08:26.763
Hendricks?

01:09:32.591 --> 01:09:36.796
"Martha May Hendricks
began to be disturbed

01:09:36.796 --> 01:09:39.633
by scratching sounds that
came from the basement..."

01:09:44.004 --> 01:09:49.877
"...and objects were often found
to be moved without explanation.

01:09:49.975 --> 01:09:55.984
She reported to her husband that
she'd felt rejected and alone..."

01:10:02.855 --> 01:10:06.492
"...and had been invaded
by an invisible entity."

01:10:30.716 --> 01:10:34.520
"When her husband was out
of town, Martha May claimed

01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:38.023
she was being attacked
by an unseen force."

01:10:44.431 --> 01:10:49.207
"...followed out to the Granville estate,
where an exorcism was attempted."

01:10:50.936 --> 01:10:53.539
S-U-E-D-O...

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.574
"She killed herself with a blade

01:10:55.575 --> 01:11:01.414
after a failed attempt of exorcism
by father Callahan of Cornerstone."

01:11:01.415 --> 01:11:03.719
No!

01:11:04.451 --> 01:11:06.656
Father Callahan.

01:11:10.556 --> 01:11:12.726
"Martha May Hendricks is survived

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:17.633
by her husband deputy Jed Hendricks."

01:12:33.073 --> 01:12:36.241
How could you cover this up?

01:12:36.243 --> 01:12:39.382
How could you lie about this?

01:12:40.279 --> 01:12:44.387
You think you know a lot, but...

01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:48.056
You don't know the whole story.

01:12:49.288 --> 01:12:52.795
I know you're hiding behind this.

01:12:56.263 --> 01:12:59.099
I wasn't acting under
God's authority and power

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:02.066
when I did the deliverance.

01:13:02.067 --> 01:13:05.374
Was I wrong?

01:13:05.906 --> 01:13:08.778
Absolutely.

01:13:10.209 --> 01:13:13.315
What is it that you want from me?

01:13:13.712 --> 01:13:18.316
My wife needs your help.

01:13:20.987 --> 01:13:22.556
I can't.

01:13:22.557 --> 01:13:26.191
Look, this-this... this is your
chance for redemption right here.

01:13:26.192 --> 01:13:28.093
No one else has seen this before.

01:13:28.094 --> 01:13:31.166
I need your help. I'm beggin' you.

01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:38.103
I swore I wouldn't do it again.

01:13:38.104 --> 01:13:40.876
Please.

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:49.118
I can't.

01:13:53.352 --> 01:13:55.621
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

01:13:55.622 --> 01:14:00.362
You're a coward! That's all
you are! You're a fake!

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.256
Oh my God.

01:14:30.257 --> 01:14:31.390
What have you done?

01:14:31.391 --> 01:14:33.392
S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

01:14:33.393 --> 01:14:36.899
S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

01:14:53.745 --> 01:14:55.914
I know what you did.

01:14:57.918 --> 01:15:01.655
Your wife is a whore in hell.

01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:05.360
You took everything from me.

01:15:07.793 --> 01:15:10.933
Rachel!

01:15:11.665 --> 01:15:14.400
Put the knife down, okay?

01:15:14.401 --> 01:15:16.368
- Rachel.
- Rachel?

01:15:16.369 --> 01:15:19.406
Oh, she's not here right now.

01:15:22.841 --> 01:15:25.310
We can work this out, okay?

01:15:28.113 --> 01:15:30.316
S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

01:15:30.317 --> 01:15:32.786
S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

01:15:32.787 --> 01:15:36.354
S-U-E-D-O...

01:15:36.355 --> 01:15:37.456
S-U-E-D-O-M-S-A.

01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:55.341
I've wandered through the
desert and found no rest.

01:15:55.342 --> 01:16:00.379
"Swept and garnished,
but still empty."

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:03.385
Rachel!

01:16:05.317 --> 01:16:08.257
Rachel!

01:16:14.493 --> 01:16:16.495
"Go proclaim the word.

01:16:16.496 --> 01:16:18.397
Whoever believes will be saved."

01:16:18.398 --> 01:16:21.066
If you don't, you die.
Your blood spills.

01:16:23.904 --> 01:16:28.173
"Oh, in my name they
will cast out demons,

01:16:28.174 --> 01:16:30.442
speak in tongues, pick up snakes."

01:16:30.443 --> 01:16:32.746
At the right hand of God I sit.

01:16:32.747 --> 01:16:36.015
All authority on earth
has been given to me.

01:16:36.016 --> 01:16:38.088
Rachel!

01:16:56.802 --> 01:16:59.242
Rachel.

01:17:01.874 --> 01:17:03.909
It's me.

01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:06.416
It's Michael.

01:17:09.448 --> 01:17:12.952
Hey, sweetie, listen,

01:17:12.953 --> 01:17:16.125
it's gonna be okay, okay?

01:17:17.422 --> 01:17:19.493
Hey! Rachel!

01:17:21.494 --> 01:17:25.936
Rachel, listen to me!
Rachel, it's me!

01:17:28.233 --> 01:17:30.436
It's me!

01:17:31.437 --> 01:17:34.373
- Rachel!
- "I saw Satan fall

01:17:34.374 --> 01:17:36.508
like lightning from heaven.

01:17:36.509 --> 01:17:42.317
Behold, I have given you
authority to tread on serpents."

01:17:44.116 --> 01:17:45.584
Rachel!

01:17:53.827 --> 01:17:57.166
Lie with me, priest.

01:17:58.130 --> 01:18:01.103
Take my body.

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:05.040
Taste it.

01:18:05.804 --> 01:18:07.840
I know you want to.

01:18:07.841 --> 01:18:12.648
Father, give me strength.

01:18:16.516 --> 01:18:18.584
You're weak.

01:18:19.986 --> 01:18:22.288
Taste my body, priest.

01:18:22.289 --> 01:18:24.323
Touch it.

01:18:24.324 --> 01:18:26.592
"You will not surely die."

01:18:26.593 --> 01:18:29.495
Help me, father. I lay
my fears at your feet.

01:18:29.496 --> 01:18:32.364
I know what you did. You ran away!

01:18:32.365 --> 01:18:35.301
A scared-shitless priest.

01:18:35.302 --> 01:18:37.403
You are a coward!

01:18:37.404 --> 01:18:39.571
A fake!

01:18:42.708 --> 01:18:46.378
- Give me your name!
- You wanna touch me.

01:18:46.379 --> 01:18:49.782
- You wanna taste me.
- Give me your name.

01:18:49.783 --> 01:18:52.017
Give me your seed, priest!

01:18:52.018 --> 01:18:55.054
- Ha!
- Give me your name!

01:19:05.065 --> 01:19:07.232
Fear me.

01:19:07.234 --> 01:19:09.902
Doubts and lies, priest.

01:19:09.903 --> 01:19:12.404
Doubts and lies!

01:19:12.405 --> 01:19:14.673
You fake! Come on, priest.

01:19:14.674 --> 01:19:17.209
Oh, you can do better
than that. I know you can.

01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:20.412
Come on, hit me. Hit me really hard.

01:19:20.513 --> 01:19:24.116
"Anointed guardian cherub, in the
midst of stones and fire you walk."

01:19:27.254 --> 01:19:31.557
"I cast you as a profane evil from the
Mountain of God. And I destroy you!"

01:19:38.597 --> 01:19:41.934
"You have come to a dreadful end
and shall be no more forever!"

01:19:41.935 --> 01:19:44.603
All of this I give to you,

01:19:44.604 --> 01:19:47.940
if you bow down

01:19:47.941 --> 01:19:49.375
and worship me.

01:19:49.376 --> 01:19:53.594
- You're a fake. Who is your master?
- Seven dwell inside me.

01:19:54.579 --> 01:20:00.052
- You're a coward! Say his name!
- Him I know. You I don't.

01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:09.465
"I saw his spirit come down from
the sky like a dove." Say his name!

01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:18.304
You're a coward. Say his name!

01:20:18.305 --> 01:20:20.105
Say his name!

01:20:20.106 --> 01:20:23.475
His name! "You have come
to a dreadful end!"

01:20:23.476 --> 01:20:26.611
Say his name. Say his name!

01:20:26.612 --> 01:20:29.885
Yeshua!

01:20:30.082 --> 01:20:34.356
Yeshua!

01:20:35.087 --> 01:20:40.462
Ye-shu-aaa!

01:21:27.672 --> 01:21:30.551
This changes things,

01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:32.795
doesn't it?

01:21:32.796 --> 01:21:36.115
Hey, I think you're getting better.

01:21:36.116 --> 01:21:40.556
- You know I'm not.
- No.

01:21:42.187 --> 01:21:44.892
Why are you here?

01:21:54.166 --> 01:21:58.272
'Cause we're on the
same side, Rachel.

01:21:59.071 --> 01:22:00.539
I love you

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.374
and I will spend

01:22:02.375 --> 01:22:06.448
the rest of my life showing you that.

01:22:06.679 --> 01:22:09.618
You need to leave.

01:22:10.416 --> 01:22:13.889
I'm sorry.

01:23:03.902 --> 01:23:06.571
You were there

01:23:06.572 --> 01:23:09.810
and you kept it a secret.

01:23:16.781 --> 01:23:20.653
You know, when I was a kid

01:23:20.654 --> 01:23:22.655
my daddy took me to the Rialto

01:23:22.656 --> 01:23:25.157
to see "The Man Who
Shot Liberty Valance."

01:23:25.158 --> 01:23:29.828
Mmm! John Wayne, Jimmy
Stewart, Lee Marvin.

01:23:29.829 --> 01:23:32.864
When 'ol Liberty come
strolling through town,

01:23:32.865 --> 01:23:34.934
he'd just take whatever
the hell he wanted.

01:23:34.935 --> 01:23:37.903
That is until Ransom
Stoddard had the courage

01:23:37.904 --> 01:23:40.639
to stand up for the town.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.175
He got beat down, kicked, spit on,

01:23:43.176 --> 01:23:49.451
but he looked fear in the eye
with courage and integrity.

01:23:51.584 --> 01:23:55.022
That stuck with me.

01:23:56.922 --> 01:24:00.062
Didn't give an inch.

01:24:02.795 --> 01:24:05.801
What happened to your wife?

01:24:16.942 --> 01:24:20.212
Jesus Christ, you gotta help us.
I can't do it without you!

01:24:20.213 --> 01:24:22.248
I'm sorry. I can't do it! I'm sorry!

01:24:22.249 --> 01:24:27.686
You can never satisfy
me the way that he did.

01:24:27.687 --> 01:24:32.361
I carry his seed inside of me.

01:24:37.229 --> 01:24:40.502
You're weak.

01:24:41.968 --> 01:24:43.602
Hendricks, don't do it.

01:24:43.603 --> 01:24:45.904
You're a fake.

01:24:45.906 --> 01:24:49.341
Come on do it. Do it!

01:24:49.343 --> 01:24:51.511
Hendricks, no, stop!

01:24:52.012 --> 01:24:54.516
No!

01:25:12.865 --> 01:25:16.769
Martha May, she brought
that demon into our home

01:25:16.770 --> 01:25:22.940
where it dwelled and-and-and
seduced her and tortured her.

01:25:22.942 --> 01:25:27.445
Michael, temp... temptation to
give into evil, it comes from us

01:25:27.446 --> 01:25:30.049
and only us. She knew what she did.

01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:32.350
There's no one to blame

01:25:32.351 --> 01:25:35.353
but the s... seducing

01:25:35.354 --> 01:25:37.957
and-and-and leering
flare-up of our own lust.

01:25:37.958 --> 01:25:41.926
That's where my wife found
fulfillment, but it was a lie!

01:25:41.927 --> 01:25:44.629
She allowed evil

01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:48.633
to-to-to flourish and that
became the real killer!

01:25:48.634 --> 01:25:51.337
- You killed an innocent person.
- She was not innocent!

01:25:51.338 --> 01:25:54.005
She was in the arms of another man!

01:25:59.345 --> 01:26:02.513
I did what I had to do.

01:26:02.514 --> 01:26:06.455
That's a lonely way of
thinking, don't you think?

01:26:07.319 --> 01:26:09.455
Funny thing about
that little fella...

01:26:09.456 --> 01:26:14.196
so small, still carrying all
that weight by himself.

01:26:16.961 --> 01:26:19.415
But he's still carrying it.

01:26:19.416 --> 01:26:21.382
We all have our...

01:26:21.383 --> 01:26:24.069
trove of secrets,

01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:26.421
regrets.

01:26:27.539 --> 01:26:31.179
That was the worst day
of my life, Michael.

01:26:31.943 --> 01:26:34.679
There's not a day goes
by I don't run it over

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:38.019
and over and over and
over and over and over...

01:26:38.117 --> 01:26:43.558
Oh God, I wish I could
stop my anger, that blade.

01:26:44.889 --> 01:26:46.759
Pride comes...

01:26:48.929 --> 01:26:52.501
Disgrace follows.

01:26:53.666 --> 01:26:55.867
I...

01:26:55.868 --> 01:27:00.675
I realize I don't have
what it takes anymore.

01:27:02.006 --> 01:27:04.375
I'm done.

01:27:04.376 --> 01:27:07.215
I'm finished.

01:27:09.914 --> 01:27:11.916
"Wretched man that I am,

01:27:11.917 --> 01:27:15.719
who will deliver me from
this body of death?"

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.593
I'm finished.

01:27:19.924 --> 01:27:23.162
Mimic the one who

01:27:23.163 --> 01:27:25.530
took a stand,

01:27:25.531 --> 01:27:28.603
didn't give an inch.

01:27:31.936 --> 01:27:35.309
I'll be damned.

01:27:38.042 --> 01:27:40.678
You a religious guy?

01:27:40.679 --> 01:27:44.119
God-fearing.

01:27:47.886 --> 01:27:51.959
I believe that there are different
levels of evil in the world.

01:27:53.792 --> 01:27:55.995
No rituals. No magic.

01:27:55.996 --> 01:28:00.498
It already dwells in all of us...
that's it, that's the battle.

01:28:04.169 --> 01:28:06.504
This is war.

01:28:06.505 --> 01:28:08.440
There's no neutral ground.

01:28:24.956 --> 01:28:29.965
<i>What if I disappear, disappear?</i>

01:28:30.094 --> 01:28:34.169
<i>What if I fall?</i>

01:28:35.834 --> 01:28:39.737
<i>Would I ever make it</i>

01:28:39.738 --> 01:28:45.313
<i>Back at all?</i>

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:53.584
<i>Dreaming, fading</i>

01:28:53.586 --> 01:28:57.121
<i>Standing here</i>

01:28:57.122 --> 01:29:02.230
<i>It's almost funny now</i>

01:29:03.062 --> 01:29:07.736
<i>It's almost funny now</i>

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:13.642
<i>What if I disappear, disappear?</i>

01:29:14.073 --> 01:29:17.646
<i>What if I fall?</i>

01:29:19.178 --> 01:29:24.817
<i>Would anything be the same?</i>

01:29:24.818 --> 01:29:29.924
<i>Everything's changed</i>

01:29:29.954 --> 01:29:34.525
<i>Everything's changed</i>

01:29:34.526 --> 01:29:39.796
<i>Dreaming, fading</i>

01:29:39.797 --> 01:29:43.868
<i>Standing here</i>

01:29:43.869 --> 01:29:48.176
<i>It's almost funny now</i>

01:29:49.307 --> 01:29:54.416
<i>It's almost funny now</i>

01:29:54.779 --> 01:29:59.688
<i>What if I disappear, disappear?</i>

01:30:00.286 --> 01:30:03.858
<i>What if I fall?</i>

01:30:05.557 --> 01:30:10.962
<i>Would anything be the same?</i>

01:30:10.963 --> 01:30:16.568
<i>- Everything's changed
- Everything's changed</i>

01:30:16.570 --> 01:30:22.106
<i>What if I run away,
run away, run away?</i>

01:30:22.107 --> 01:30:26.590
<i>Went up in flames</i>

01:30:27.321 --> 01:30:32.785
<i>How long can I hold on?</i>

01:30:32.786 --> 01:30:37.459
<i>Everything's changed</i>

01:30:38.157 --> 01:30:43.297
<i>Everything's changed</i>

01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:54.242
<i>Everything's changed.</i>
