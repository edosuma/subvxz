00:11.720 --> 00:14.180
Would anybody like
to talk about God's message?

00:14.264 --> 00:16.266
-This guy!
-Would you like to talk about God?

00:16.349 --> 00:18.518
There you go, sir. Thank you, thank you.

00:18.601 --> 00:21.312
-Don't just throw it away!
-Uh-- He threw it away.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.398
Ah! Litterbug!

00:23.481 --> 00:24.899
-G-O-D.
-Yeah, you know me!

00:24.983 --> 00:27.610
-You're not interested. That's okay.
-No? This-- Aw.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.320
You're doin' great. Doin' great.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.239
Feel like my timing's off.

00:32.866 --> 00:33.783
Look at that.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.453
-Bingo.
-I surprised myself. I had more emotion.

00:36.536 --> 00:39.080
-That felt good.
-Keep it up. Yeah. You're doing good.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.999
I'll kinda dance into it a bit.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.083
-Uh
-No.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.044
-That's--
-It's okay.

00:44.127 --> 00:47.422
Hey, anybody wanna
hear about God's message?

00:47.505 --> 00:48.339
Sir?

00:48.423 --> 00:51.593
Hi there, guys. Faith no more?
How about faith s'more?

00:51.676 --> 00:54.012
-Dude, fuck off.
-Jackass.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.972
Not a pun guy. This is not a pun crowd.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.350
-Who wants to talk about God?
-Anyone wanna talk about God?

01:03.938 --> 01:07.108
I am sitting here
with the Reverend Milton Throp

01:07.192 --> 01:10.403
who is quickly becoming
the most powerful and beloved

01:10.487 --> 01:12.864
religious figure
here in Southern California.

01:12.947 --> 01:17.327
Well, I'm not so sure about that, Tamara,
but I thank you and bless you.

01:17.827 --> 01:21.664
Now, when, may I ask,
did you first hear the call of the Lord?

01:21.748 --> 01:24.459
Well, Tamara, to quote
the late, great Johnny Cash,

01:24.542 --> 01:28.254
who is undoubtedly
roasting in Hell right now,

01:28.797 --> 01:30.256
I've been everywhere, man.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.008
<i>You see, I was bad…</i>

01:32.092 --> 01:34.260
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.846
What are you watching?

01:36.930 --> 01:40.767
Oh, remember how I thought
that shitty reverend looked familiar?

01:40.850 --> 01:43.478
I looked up an old infomercial.
I was right.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.188
I had this sweet aunt.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.732
She bought into all his bullshit,
and he took all her money.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.651
-Oh, that's too bad. Jeez.
-Yeah.

01:49.734 --> 01:50.819
-There he is!
-I know--

01:50.902 --> 01:53.738
-Liar!
-There are so many people outside.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.699
There were people outside before,
but there are so many now.

01:56.783 --> 02:00.245
There's media vans, like,
all up and down the street. It's crazy.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.372
This is all just kinda too much.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.499
We gotta get outta here.

02:04.582 --> 02:06.334
Okay. Yeah. Where do you wanna go?

02:06.417 --> 02:07.961
I thought we should probably go to work.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.295
Oh shit.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.506
I keep forgetting I have a job.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.217
-Oh boy.
-Wow.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.137
Oh boy.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.680
Clark, can you heal me?

02:18.763 --> 02:19.931
I don't think I can.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.808
-Personal space.
-So sorry. Hi.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.364
What did you just say?

02:36.447 --> 02:40.618
I think I paraphrased Corinthians
in Spanish. Apparently I know both.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.120
Lies! Oh, there he is!

02:42.203 --> 02:44.956
Um, hey, everybody.
So nice to see so many of you here.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.292
-Some of you look angry.
-I'm gonna kick your ass!

02:47.375 --> 02:49.919
Shut up and back up!
Know why people think you're crazy?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.212
Because you act crazy!

02:51.796 --> 02:54.215
All right? You act crazy
'cause you are crazy.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.675
-I will run you over.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.218
Sister wife, move it.

02:58.011 --> 02:58.845
Move!

02:58.928 --> 03:01.097
Don't you have a gun rally you can go to?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.724
Don't you want a helmet?

03:02.807 --> 03:05.810
No, the metal plate
in my head gets too hot.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.618
It's no use.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.995
-Why can't I work this contraption?
-Hey.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.873
You almost have two sides.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.918
I need all six sides.
Two sides is nothing. It's nothing.

03:32.503 --> 03:33.588
Stupid, evil cube.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.006
Suck it!

03:40.011 --> 03:42.889
I'm so sorry for that outburst.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.516
Um, I don't know.
I guess it's just how I was raised.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.853
I don't know,
maybe you can relate, but, um…

03:49.437 --> 03:52.023
You know, my parents
emigrated here from Pakistan,

03:52.106 --> 03:55.568
and so failure has never really
been an option for us in this country.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.445
I understand that.

03:57.528 --> 04:00.198
I feel like failure
can't be an option for me either.

04:00.281 --> 04:03.243
Yeah. I mean, you're doing great, though.

04:03.326 --> 04:07.038
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
That's really kind of you to say.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.748
Mohsin, Mohsin, Mohsin.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.085
Don't get mad
at your colored cube, my man.

04:12.168 --> 04:17.173
Here's a pro tip. YouTube one of those
puzzle hack videos, and nail that shit.

04:17.840 --> 04:21.344
-I did that and solved it in five minutes.
-I don't wanna watch a video. All right?

04:21.427 --> 04:24.597
I wanna learn how to do it properly,
by myself. And you're clearly lying.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.433
You've never solved
a Rubik's Cube, have you?

04:28.851 --> 04:32.021
Well, you know, my point was,
you know, if I wanted to, I could.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.023
Those… those videos are great.

04:34.899 --> 04:38.194
But yeah. No, I've never
come close to solving a Rubik's Cube.

04:39.195 --> 04:43.533
And if I'm being honest, I'm not
really good at accessing YouTube.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.660
Okay, that's absurd.

04:45.743 --> 04:48.288
You literally work
at a computer tech company,

04:48.371 --> 04:50.039
and kids know how to access YouTube.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.208
Yeah, but you need
a password or something…

04:52.292 --> 04:54.043
-Hi, guys.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.546
-Hey, hey. Check out the lovebirds, huh?
-Hi, Tom.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.090
Are we past the official hookup stage, or…

04:59.173 --> 05:00.550
-Oof.
-Oh my God.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.553
That is so completely inappropriate, Tom.

05:03.636 --> 05:07.598
People don't talk like that anymore.
What year do you think this is?

05:08.182 --> 05:12.687
Well, if I'm being honest, I'm never sure
of the exact year because of my dyslexia.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.857
-That doesn't make any sense.
-Be that as it may, um…

05:15.940 --> 05:17.692
I'm sorry.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.027
-Whoa.
-What?

05:19.777 --> 05:22.488
I'm gonna need you to… repeat that.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.324
What was the last thing
you just said to me?

05:26.242 --> 05:27.577
I'm sorry.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.079
Wow. First time for everything, I guess.

05:30.955 --> 05:34.709
Yeah, well, I noticed
that my comment was insensitive.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.545
You know me, I like to get messy.

05:38.296 --> 05:42.133
And often, you know, I'm about to say
something stupid, and then I say it.

05:42.216 --> 05:45.386
And before I can stop myself
from saying it, I've already said it.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.096
Hoo!

05:48.264 --> 05:49.307
I'd like to apologize.

05:50.058 --> 05:53.227
Okay, Tom. I accept your apology.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.938
-Is this really happening?
-You need a copy of this.

05:56.022 --> 05:59.275
Okay, look, I didn't sleep
a wink last night, all right?

05:59.359 --> 06:02.779
And I think it's because ever since
I saw that video of you glowing,

06:02.862 --> 06:05.031
I've become a changed man.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.115
Uh…

06:06.199 --> 06:08.534
Clark, I think you might be holy,
or something.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.954
And, you know, that's why you glow,
and that's why you know stuff.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.832
I wanna be better,
and maybe you can help me do that,

06:14.916 --> 06:16.376
because, I don't know, you've been…

06:17.377 --> 06:18.669
chosen?

06:18.753 --> 06:20.171
I don't know if I've been chosen.

06:20.254 --> 06:24.217
You know what? I think that
I've discovered life's true meaning.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.136
And maybe it's for me to get-- get better.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.930
I think I can be better.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.015
My life has purpose now.
I think it's to follow you.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.935
-Follow me?
-Yeah.

06:36.854 --> 06:37.814
Can I get a hug, man?

06:38.773 --> 06:40.566
-Sure, of course.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.529
Come here, buddy. You're okay, Tom.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.322
This is the best hug ever.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.368
-Oh boy.

06:50.451 --> 06:51.577
Oh…

06:52.578 --> 06:54.038
Oh, oh…

06:54.122 --> 06:55.456
Oh wow. Okay.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.833
This is happening.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.585
It sure is.
I can feel you flowing through me.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.588
If you don't start submitting time sheets,

07:02.672 --> 07:04.549
corporate is gonna
ding me for noncompliance,

07:04.632 --> 07:07.093
and that
is not the way Frisbee plays pickleball.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.555
Clark, the glowing is gorgeous.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.432
Tom, need the hands above the equator.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.434
Yes, of course.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.689
Okay, Tom. You're okay.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.943
I'm so sorry, everybody,
I didn't mean to interrupt your day

07:24.026 --> 07:27.530
and to bring you into this… thing.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.448
It's okay.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.575
Okay, show-- show's over.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.578
Show's over, okay?
You know, just somebody glowing.

07:33.661 --> 07:34.787
Bella, show's over.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.540
-He glowed.
-Yeah, I know. Take it down.

07:40.084 --> 07:40.960
Oof.

07:41.043 --> 07:45.965
Tom, I've gotta say, this is the least
asshole-ish version of you I've ever seen.

07:48.676 --> 07:51.762
Let it out, Tom.
Just let it all out. That's the way.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.348
Oh, gross.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.351
What is going on with me?

07:57.852 --> 07:59.729
Just let the soothing game soothe you.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.314
-Just be soothed.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.903
-Oh, Clark.
-Oh, my gosh. No, Tom!

08:06.986 --> 08:09.363
No, Tom! No! Oh, my gosh.

08:09.447 --> 08:13.159
No, you can't do that. No!
That's my worst nightmare come to life.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.995
Look, man, we are way past that.
I'm following you now.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.623
-Any luck, by the way?
-Any luck with what?

08:18.706 --> 08:20.208
The constipation business.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.667
Oh, no, no, no. No, Tom.

08:21.751 --> 08:25.505
That's exactly what I didn't want to be…
That's my issue and my concern.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.508
I wouldn't share that with anyone.
Not even a… a follower.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.176
Hey, you got it, holy man.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.762
Quick offer…
I'd like to be your bodyguard.

08:32.845 --> 08:35.640
-What?
-Yeah, man. I need to help you.

08:36.307 --> 08:37.934
I'll kick ass for you, man!

08:38.434 --> 08:41.187
Well, I mean, I don't know.
There's a lot goin' on, but…

08:41.771 --> 08:44.941
-Are you really good at fighting?
-No! Oh, no. Far from it.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.193
That's, like,
a pretty big flaw in your plan.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.363
Yeah, I guess you could call it that.
A flaw.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.449
Almost as big a flaw as, like,
looking at people as they…

08:54.283 --> 08:56.327
-…bathroom.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.668
That's awesome.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.795
Tom, a little space, please.

09:05.878 --> 09:09.549
Oh, hi. I tried to stop him
from following you in there,

09:09.632 --> 09:11.801
but he's too slippery and slimy.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.219
Tom, back off.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.387
Not possible.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.889
Are you, uh, in a hurry?

09:16.973 --> 09:19.225
Oh yeah, my dad
actually wants to talk to me, so…

09:19.308 --> 09:21.018
Oh, good. That's a-- that's a good thing.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.688
I mean, I don't know your dad,
but if you want some…

09:24.355 --> 09:25.856
some company or support?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.817
Oh, actually,
we're gonna take a sauna together.

09:27.900 --> 09:28.985
-Oh, I'm out.
-I'm in.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.486
-You're out.
-You got it.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.698
But maybe I could see you later?
Tell you all about it?

09:33.781 --> 09:34.699
Yeah.

09:34.782 --> 09:37.868
I don't mean to be in your business.
I don't have to get up all in your grill.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.870
I like you in my grill.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.539
-Cool.
-Good luck with your dad.

09:42.206 --> 09:45.376
I'm gonna catch a few Zs here at work,
and then we can meet up later.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.045
No. No, there's no sleeping in the office.

09:48.629 --> 09:51.007
-Frisbee, get back to your hole.
-Fine.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.802
-And turn off the overheads.
-Other people are working.

09:54.885 --> 09:59.265
Oh, good idea. You know what,
everybody get those ringers off, please.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.310
-Five-minute break, everybody.
-All right!

10:06.939 --> 10:09.233
-Love you, Clark!
-Hey! There he is!

10:12.653 --> 10:14.614
-Liar!
-I love Clark!

10:14.697 --> 10:16.240
Sorry about the news trucks, Pop.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.452
You know, I think you're gonna find
this whole thing

10:19.535 --> 10:21.787
is just a big misunder… standing.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.706
Hello there, Clark.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.208
Pop, how could you?

10:26.292 --> 10:28.294
The reverend is here to help you, son.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.005
I mean, he wanted a meeting,
so he called me,

10:31.088 --> 10:34.050
and I-- I invited him here
to pleasurably sauna with us.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.261
Aren't you hot?

10:37.845 --> 10:40.640
The righteous don't sweat.
Please, have a seat.

10:40.723 --> 10:41.974
Oh boy. Okay.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.479
Do you know, Clark,
the story of the boy who cried wolf?

10:46.562 --> 10:48.397
-Sure. Very familiar.
-It was written by Aesop.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.024
-Listen--
-Aesop's fable is about a boy

10:50.107 --> 10:51.651
who kept crying wolf,

10:51.734 --> 10:56.864
even though it was clear there was no wolf
threatening his flock of sheep.

10:56.947 --> 11:01.035
And then one day,
he finally actually saw a wolf.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.412
And he cried wolf again. "Wolf! Wolf!"

11:04.080 --> 11:08.250
And the townspeople didn't come to his aid

11:08.334 --> 11:10.586
because they didn't trust him anymore.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.713
His flock were devoured.

11:13.422 --> 11:17.760
The moral of this fable
is that liars are not believed,

11:17.843 --> 11:20.262
even when they speak the truth.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.015
-Do you follow me?
-Uh…

11:23.099 --> 11:25.643
Pretty clearly, you think
I'm the boy who cried wolf.

11:25.726 --> 11:29.063
-We could've gotten there faster.
-Indeed. I won't have my flock devoured

11:29.146 --> 11:32.191
because they're distracted
by an infantile boy like yourself

11:32.274 --> 11:34.694
who is intent on lying to us all.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.778
You know,

11:36.487 --> 11:39.657
just as a counterpoint,
I didn't ask for any of this.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.117
It just sorta happened.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.870
I mean, it's not a trick. Um, this is,
like, a real thing, and, uh, it's weird.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.164
Please, please, son.
Please come clean.

11:47.248 --> 11:50.418
I mean, you have to stop lying.
Especially to me.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.503
I mean, come on. What do you say?

11:53.295 --> 11:54.255
You know what?

11:55.589 --> 11:56.882
Let me see if I can show you.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.388
What are you doing?

12:06.058 --> 12:07.101
Oh my God.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.770
Okay, wow. So, cool. So I made it happen.

12:09.854 --> 12:10.813
Oh my God.

12:11.522 --> 12:15.234
Oh, son, I'm so…
I'm so sorry I didn't believe you.

12:15.317 --> 12:16.610
It's okay, Pop. I mean, it's--

12:16.694 --> 12:19.739
I understand it's a lot to take in.
But it's definitely not a trick.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.282
How dare you?

12:21.365 --> 12:23.033
Chicanery against God.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.995
-Chicanery?
-Turn that infernal light off immediately.

12:26.078 --> 12:29.623
-Where is your remote clicker?
-Remote clicker? I mean, I… I'm in a robe.

12:29.707 --> 12:33.252
-Where would it be? My hands are here.
-I know exactly where your clicker is.

12:33.335 --> 12:34.295
It's up your bottom.

12:34.879 --> 12:38.299
Ugh! Why would I have
a remote clicker in my--

12:38.382 --> 12:39.550
-Because you're vile.
-Hey!

12:39.633 --> 12:43.596
You call my son vile again, I'm gonna
punch the teeth right out your head!

12:43.679 --> 12:44.930
-Easy.
-I won't have charlatans

12:45.014 --> 12:48.517
taking attention away
from God-fearing souls like myself,

12:48.601 --> 12:50.770
who are the true messengers of the Lord.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.564
I promise you, Clark.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.317
Stop this trickery immediately,

12:56.942 --> 12:58.652
or I will destroy you.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.074
You eat a plate of crap!

13:06.118 --> 13:09.288
You really felt like you could
control the light more this time?

13:09.371 --> 13:11.499
I really think I did, yeah.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.000
Well, that could be big.

13:13.584 --> 13:17.713
I hope so. I feel like my purpose is so
close, and I can't quite figure it out.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.425
I know that you are going to--
to figure out what you need to do.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.968
-Thank you.
-Okay.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.053
-Thanks.
-Coffee?

13:24.136 --> 13:25.471
-Oh no, thank you.
-You got it.

13:26.055 --> 13:30.017
The good news is that you and your dad
are doing okay again.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.977
-Yeah. Thank you.
-I know you're close.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.103
-Thanks.
-Cream?

13:33.187 --> 13:35.731
-No, thank you.
-All right. Here you go.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.692
Um… not to pry, but…

13:39.735 --> 13:41.987
I was kind of wondering if your mom was…

13:43.072 --> 13:45.533
you know, still in the picture or with us?

13:45.616 --> 13:47.409
Oh, um, she's fine.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.287
Uh, my mom and dad got divorced
when I was 13.

13:50.371 --> 13:53.415
And, uh, my mom
actually kind of cheated on my dad.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.627
-What do you mean, kind of?
-Uh, she just cheated on my dad.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.796
Yeah. Then, when they split up,

13:58.879 --> 14:02.341
um, you know, it seemed like she didn't
wanna hang out with me that much.

14:02.424 --> 14:05.386
But me and my dad are so close,
so I just stayed with him, and…

14:05.469 --> 14:07.972
and I still see my mom on Christmas
and, you know…

14:08.806 --> 14:10.266
uh, Christmas.

14:12.059 --> 14:12.893
Tom.

14:15.604 --> 14:17.648
Respectfully,
I've been eavesdropping on you.

14:17.731 --> 14:22.903
Polite and creepy. That's-- that's
a hard combo to master, but you did it.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.906
Uh…what's with the giant,
weird sword, buddy?

14:25.990 --> 14:27.116
Clark.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.784
Whoa!

14:28.868 --> 14:31.203
I pledge my sword to you.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.498
-Are you proposing to him, as well?

14:34.582 --> 14:36.083
No, Amily, it's figurative.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.961
Now that I'm going to be
Clark's bodyguard.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.629
What? I did not agree to that, Tom.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.008
Don't worry. I'm not gonna be able
to slice up anybody with this. It's foam.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.050
Oh, thank God.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.804
Although I suppose
I could bludgeon someone with it.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.765
-Mm.
-Do you want me to bludgeon that reverend?

14:51.849 --> 14:52.683
What?

14:52.766 --> 14:56.061
-No. You-- you were gonna say no, right?
-I was waiting.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.606
-To see which way the wind blows.
-Oh, you were waiting to see…

14:58.689 --> 14:59.982
-I was on the fence.
-Okay. No.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.317
-Absolutely not.
-Okay.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.569
-No bludgeoning of anybody.
-Okay, good. Whew!

15:03.652 --> 15:06.906
Quick question.
Why do you have a giant sword?

15:06.989 --> 15:08.991
-Where did you get it?
-I can show you.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.871
Who of you is bold enough

15:14.496 --> 15:18.334
-to vanquish the Ogre of Gilgoth…

15:18.417 --> 15:23.631
…in a pitched battle
to decide the fate of all Gilgarath?

15:26.383 --> 15:28.218
I am so bold.

15:28.302 --> 15:32.973
-Oh, dreadful goblin Gamwyn of Glendathf.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.517
-What am I looking at?
-Live-action role playing.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.728
-I'm a LARPer.
-You look really neat.

15:37.811 --> 15:41.857
<i>Why, yes, Goladriyule of Gilgar.</i>

15:41.941 --> 15:43.025
Hmm. Similar names.

15:43.108 --> 15:47.863
<i>Yes, it is I, Gidriyule of Gilgar,</i>
<i>and I challenge thee…</i>

15:47.947 --> 15:50.366
<i>-…Ogre of Golgath!</i>

15:50.449 --> 15:54.536
There's a lot of Gs when there are 25
other letters in the alphabet, but okay.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.955
I mentioned it to all of them,

15:56.038 --> 15:58.666
but Vernon makes the names,
and he's the quest manager.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.584
-So…
-Is Vernon the cheeky goblin?

16:00.668 --> 16:02.711
-Yes.
-How do you know that?

16:03.837 --> 16:05.464
-Hearken to me!

16:06.256 --> 16:07.800
The Blizzard Queen.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.760
Oh!

16:09.843 --> 16:15.391
Golidriyule of Gilgar, you must first
defeat me, Glenwyn of Galdathlian,

16:15.474 --> 16:19.061
in a pitched battle
for the honor of dispatching

16:19.144 --> 16:20.104
that bitch.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.648
-Suck it, Amily.
-Guys, don't break character.

16:22.731 --> 16:26.402
-I alone shall save Golgarath.
-She alone has the power.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.820
Jim, Joe.

16:27.903 --> 16:29.905
-Release me of my beast.

16:29.989 --> 16:30.906
Yes, Queen.

16:32.199 --> 16:35.995
Glenwyn,
the Blizzard Queen of Galdathlian,

16:36.495 --> 16:40.958
you must do battle
with Goladriyule of Gilgar,

16:41.041 --> 16:43.585
for you have been challenged.

16:46.880 --> 16:50.259
Challenged!
Challenged! Challenged! Challenged!

16:50.342 --> 16:51.760
Challenged! Challenged!

16:51.844 --> 16:54.763
-Challenged! Challenged!
-Let the battle begin!

16:54.847 --> 16:56.098
-A battle?
-Oh yeah.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.474
-What?
-Oh, it's a-comin'.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.019
-Oh my God, that's you and--
-Oh wow.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.187
Oh. Ow!

17:02.271 --> 17:03.480
-Mm.
-Oh!

17:03.564 --> 17:04.398
-Oh! Oh!
-Oh, yeah.

17:04.481 --> 17:05.858
Ooh! Oh!

17:05.941 --> 17:07.443
Oh! Ow! Ow!

17:08.110 --> 17:09.528
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

17:11.905 --> 17:13.574
Ohh!

17:14.533 --> 17:15.743
-Whoo!

17:21.665 --> 17:23.667
I yield! I yield! I yield, damn it!

17:30.299 --> 17:32.676
Oh my God, you went down so hard.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.470
-Tom the Bomb.
-Fuck off, Frisbee.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.554
Get in line, bud.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.223
-There you are.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.642
Oh, hey. That was some video, huh?

17:40.726 --> 17:41.643
Oh, I know.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.729
It's really good.
I should watch it every day.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.940
It feels quite good to laugh, doesn't it?
You know? Especially now.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.650
I know, yeah.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.736
Hey, Mo, I was thinking…

17:52.029 --> 17:53.030
What if this is it?

17:53.822 --> 17:55.657
-What if this is what?
-The end.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.870
Oh. Oh, no, no, no,
I don't think it's the end.

17:59.953 --> 18:03.040
But, I mean, if Clark is genuinely
some kind of prophet,

18:03.123 --> 18:04.374
then this could be it.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.336
This could be the end of days.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.589
In which case,
both you and I, and all of us,

18:11.840 --> 18:13.092
we'd all be dead.

18:14.551 --> 18:15.385
Ragnarok.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.764
Not Ragnarok. That's a Thor movie.

18:18.847 --> 18:21.183
I know. I know, I'm just…

18:21.266 --> 18:24.269
I was trying to lighten the mood.
Sorry, uh…

18:27.147 --> 18:28.065
I got you something.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.532
Is that an even-harder-to-solve
Rubik's Cube?

18:36.615 --> 18:38.826
It is actually

18:38.909 --> 18:43.789
a Pentagonal Speed Cube
Dodecahedron Magic Cube Puzzle Toy.

18:44.957 --> 18:45.916
It looks very difficult.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.335
Mm. I think so,
but I think you're up for the task.

18:48.418 --> 18:51.213
I just-- I really liked that you wouldn't

18:51.296 --> 18:53.590
quickly cheat on a Rubik's Cube
and look up the answers.

18:53.674 --> 18:57.010
It says… it says heaps about you
and your character.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.265
I think that other
Rubik's Cube was just too easy for you.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.059
So don't you give up on that one, okay?
You keep at it.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.312
Thank you. God, um…

19:07.896 --> 19:09.857
-That is so kind of you, and…
-Oh.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.942
-I'm really pleased you like it. Great.
-I do, I do.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.736
-Cool.
-I will. I'll keep-- I'll try very hard.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.737
Yes.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.366
I also wanted to say that…

19:20.075 --> 19:22.202
Look, if this is the end of days…

19:22.286 --> 19:24.329
-Hopefully not, but if it is…
-Yeah.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.331
I should tell you I think you're…

19:26.957 --> 19:28.500
I think you're really nice.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.504
-Really?
-Really.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.923
Nice. Yeah.

19:39.011 --> 19:39.845
Cool.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.477
Uh…

19:48.353 --> 19:49.479
I think you're… Oh.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.491
Oh.

20:01.575 --> 20:02.701
Oh boy.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.120
-Hi, Tom.

20:06.997 --> 20:10.334
Isn't it fun?
They can't see me. I love it.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.879
Hey, man. I didn't think I was gonna
get to see you again. So, hell-lo.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.714
Well, we're friends now.

20:15.797 --> 20:16.673
Hi, Amily.

20:17.174 --> 20:20.385
Hey, Wendy. I, uh… I like your hair up.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.138
Thank you for that. Are you okay?

20:23.722 --> 20:26.350
Just… just kind of, working on my elbow.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.644
You should get that looked at.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.729
-Hi, Clark.
-Hi, Wendy.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.899
So she… she can't see you either?

20:33.982 --> 20:35.817
I don't wanna be seen in your world.

20:35.901 --> 20:41.281
So I promise you two are the only
two mortals that can see me right now.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.116
You're here! Awesome.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.118
-Oh, hey.
-Good to see you, buddy!

20:45.202 --> 20:47.454
Hey, man. Good to see you.

20:47.537 --> 20:48.413
Wait. What?

20:48.497 --> 20:52.334
Wait. Pardon my French, but what in
the name of biscuits is goin' on here?

20:52.417 --> 20:54.086
-Uh… Long story short.
-Uh… Yes.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.296
I am an essential executive.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.674
I guess, like a middle manager in both…

20:58.757 --> 21:01.260
Heaven… and here on Earth.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.136
Pullin' double duty,
only gettin' one check.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.721
-But not complaining.
-Wait a minute.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.015
I have to wrap my head around
what I think you're saying.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.894
-Are you saying that this is an angel?
-Yes.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.813
-Yes.
-What is… what is all this?

21:12.896 --> 21:14.648
Is this, like, your goofy human suit?

21:14.731 --> 21:17.025
-Oh, he looks the same in Heaven.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.944
What do you--
what do you do up there?

21:19.027 --> 21:23.282
In Heaven, if there's a big event,
like a big celestial meeting,

21:23.365 --> 21:26.285
I would be the one responsible
for pinging all of the stakeholders.

21:26.368 --> 21:29.705
Then I would give real-time feedback
on the meeting they're in.

21:29.788 --> 21:34.376
In short, he just sends reports
of everything that everyone already knows.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.378
That's all he does here too.

21:36.461 --> 21:41.383
Hey, uh, guys. Uh, just, uh… No big deal,
uh… but I have to tell you something.

21:41.466 --> 21:44.803
When people say, "No big deal,"
often that means it's kind of a big deal.

21:44.886 --> 21:47.180
-I'm sure it's not. It's probably nothing.
-Yeah…

21:47.264 --> 21:49.057
Well, it's rather a big deal.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.852
-You just said it wasn't a big deal.
-It's a huge deal.

21:52.436 --> 21:55.063
-Ugh.
-All right. I'll just spill the beans.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.649
She's here.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.192
Who's here?

22:00.402 --> 22:01.361
Satan.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.033
Timber.
