01:09.767 --> 01:11.683
[Grunts lightly]

01:14.236 --> 01:17.537
Officer: Albuquerque police. Hello.

01:19.658 --> 01:22.408
[Knocking continues]

01:30.055 --> 01:31.554
Sir, we'd like to talk with you
for a minute.

01:32.155 --> 01:34.322
Could you open the door, please?

01:36.776 --> 01:38.260
Look, we know you're in there.

01:38.275 --> 01:40.909
You're casting a shadow
through your peephole.

01:40.944 --> 01:42.611
All we want to do is talk.

01:42.613 --> 01:43.995
Would you please open the door?

01:44.031 --> 01:45.247
[Sighs]

01:45.282 --> 01:48.333
I'd, uh, I'd prefer not to, officers.

01:48.368 --> 01:51.086
Tommy: Sir, come on and open up.

01:51.121 --> 01:53.622
[Sighs] I have a condition.

01:53.624 --> 01:55.090
Uh, I can't go outside

01:55.125 --> 01:57.426
or be exposed to what's out there.

01:57.461 --> 01:59.928
You were able to come outside
to steal your neighbor's newspaper.

01:59.963 --> 02:00.962
Chuck: I didn't steal it.

02:00.964 --> 02:02.264
I left $5.

02:02.299 --> 02:05.016
The... the cover price is 50 cents.

02:05.052 --> 02:08.470
Did your neighbor consent
to sell you her paper?

02:08.472 --> 02:09.854
I, uh... [sighs]

02:09.889 --> 02:13.141
She... I... Isn't...

02:13.143 --> 02:14.392
[Sighs]

02:14.445 --> 02:17.729
L... um, officer, let's... let's...

02:17.781 --> 02:20.899
Let's talk about something
called "probable cause."

02:20.951 --> 02:23.235
As I'm sure you know,
in the state of New Mexico,

02:23.287 --> 02:24.569
there is a two-part test

02:24.621 --> 02:26.238
to determine whether police officers

02:26.290 --> 02:28.957
have an objectively reasonable basis...

02:28.992 --> 02:32.744
[Birds chirping]

02:39.636 --> 02:43.588
The situation a-as missing, versus Arizona,

02:43.640 --> 02:47.259
as I pointed out, uh, creates an event...

02:55.853 --> 02:58.603
Hey, Tommy. Come around here, would you?

02:58.655 --> 03:01.740
And that's why the
10th circuit court of appeals

03:01.775 --> 03:04.659
ruled that a coercive order...

03:04.695 --> 03:07.162
Check this out.

03:12.870 --> 03:16.371
Requiring an individual
leave his house is seizure...

03:16.373 --> 03:19.508
And, therefore,

03:19.543 --> 03:23.044
protected under
the fourth amendment, right?

03:24.464 --> 03:26.882
Tommy: Whole lot of camp-stove fuel.

03:26.884 --> 03:28.517
Guy sure as shit sounds like a tweaker.

03:28.552 --> 03:30.135
You see what he did to the breaker box?

03:30.187 --> 03:34.356
Is he coming out, or are we going in?

03:42.316 --> 03:44.733
Officer: You got 10 seconds
to open this door,

03:44.735 --> 03:46.785
or it's coming down. You hear me?

03:46.820 --> 03:48.620
- Ah.
- Final warning!

03:48.655 --> 03:50.455
Okay, I'll... I'll... I'll...
I'll let you in,

03:50.490 --> 03:52.574
but you have to leave
your electronic devices outside.

03:52.576 --> 03:54.042
No phones, no walkie-talkies,

03:54.077 --> 03:55.327
no flashlights...

03:55.379 --> 03:58.630
Definitely, definitely no tasers.

03:58.665 --> 04:01.416
I can't emphasize that enough. Deal?

04:01.418 --> 04:03.168
Or... look, look. I'll give the paper back.

04:43.741 --> 04:47.043
Uh, James McGill to see Mr. Richard Sipes.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.911
Ricky... call me "Ricky."

04:48.963 --> 04:50.746

05:24.832 --> 05:26.282
[Clicks tongue]

05:26.334 --> 05:28.618
[Chuckles] I ought to give him
a raise. You're right.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.540
Big Ricky: Jim, I saw you on the TV...

05:34.542 --> 05:35.558
That billboard thing.

05:35.641 --> 05:37.341
And I had me a pair of insights.

05:37.343 --> 05:39.643
[Operatic music plays] Insight the first...

05:39.679 --> 05:41.846
You ain't afraid to put yourself out there.

05:41.848 --> 05:43.731
And insight the second...

05:43.766 --> 05:46.267
You believe in the <i>real</i> America...

05:46.319 --> 05:49.153
Freedom, self-sufficiency.

05:49.188 --> 05:50.404
I do.

05:50.439 --> 05:53.023
I... I really do.

05:53.025 --> 05:55.826
When I see a man like you

05:55.862 --> 05:57.077
driving that foreign shitbox of a car...

05:57.113 --> 05:58.495
Well, see, actually, it's...

05:58.531 --> 06:02.700
It's a sign a good man
can't get ahead today.

06:02.702 --> 06:04.835
It's a damned travesty. That's what it is.

06:06.172 --> 06:08.172
Well, that may be [clears throat] Ricky,

06:08.207 --> 06:09.673
but, uh...

06:09.709 --> 06:13.544
I refuse to consider myself a victim.

06:14.881 --> 06:19.049
You know, we are once again
at a point in our history

06:19.051 --> 06:21.852
where the fly-swatting hand of government

06:21.888 --> 06:24.688
is crushing the spirit
of entrepreneurship...

06:24.724 --> 06:28.475
Taxes, osha requirements,

06:28.527 --> 06:30.945
the I.N.S. poking their big, fat nose

06:30.980 --> 06:34.198
into every mother-loving hire.

06:34.233 --> 06:36.283
It's damned oppressive.

06:36.319 --> 06:38.118
It's tragic.

06:38.154 --> 06:39.737
It's un-American.

06:43.042 --> 06:46.577
Jim, I think you are
just the lawyer I need,

06:46.579 --> 06:51.715
'cause I got me a case...
Major... I say, a major case.

06:51.751 --> 06:54.501
Are you ready to clear your calendar?

06:55.922 --> 06:57.471
[Glass thuds]

06:57.506 --> 07:00.724
[Sighs] Ricky, I'm all ears.

07:00.760 --> 07:04.845
I want to secede from the United States.

07:04.897 --> 07:08.232
Now, I got 1,100 acres of property here,

07:08.267 --> 07:11.101

07:11.103 --> 07:15.572

the business-killing regulations

07:15.608 --> 07:19.693
of the country in which
it geographically lies.

07:40.716 --> 07:42.883
Yes! We are doing this!

07:42.935 --> 07:44.718
Ah. [Glasses clink]

07:44.770 --> 07:46.520
Now, it's not gonna be easy, sir.

07:46.555 --> 07:49.390
I mean, the government is
gonna fight us tooth and nail.

07:49.442 --> 07:50.975
We could end up in the supreme court...

07:50.977 --> 07:53.227
I'm talking thousands of man-hours...

07:53.279 --> 07:56.280
I mean, years of effort.

07:56.315 --> 07:57.731
[Sighs]

07:57.783 --> 08:00.150
Are you ready for that?

08:00.152 --> 08:01.986

08:01.988 --> 08:04.038
I say bring 'em on.

08:04.073 --> 08:06.323
Let's talk Turkey.

08:06.325 --> 08:07.541
What's your rate?

08:07.576 --> 08:11.328
[Breathes deeply]

08:11.330 --> 08:13.664
$450 an hour.

08:16.335 --> 08:18.135
The hell with hourly.

08:18.170 --> 08:20.004
I want you on retainer.

08:20.006 --> 08:24.141
How about $1 million even...

08:24.176 --> 08:29.096
$500,000 up front
and $500,000 when we're done?

08:29.148 --> 08:31.098
A million? [Clears throat]

08:31.150 --> 08:35.184
That seems... Fair.

08:35.187 --> 08:37.488
Would you like that in cash?

Mr. McGill, hi.

10:03.275 --> 10:04.408
Thanks so much for coming.

10:04.443 --> 10:06.160
Roland Jaycocks. Roland.

10:06.195 --> 10:07.778
Hey, Roland. Great to meet you.

10:07.780 --> 10:08.996
You can call me "Jimmy."

10:09.031 --> 10:10.330
Jimmy, absolutely.

10:10.366 --> 10:12.499
Uh, hello. Please, come on in.

10:12.535 --> 10:13.951
Oh, well, thank you.

10:13.953 --> 10:15.586
God, what was it like
climbing that billboard?

10:15.621 --> 10:17.254
Must have been pretty scary, huh?

10:18.591 --> 10:21.125
Guy needed help... that's all.

10:21.127 --> 10:23.844
You know, if I could do it, anybody could.

10:23.879 --> 10:24.928
[Chuckles]

10:24.964 --> 10:26.597
Well, my hat is off to you.

10:26.632 --> 10:28.465
So, here we are.

10:28.467 --> 10:30.767
And patent law <i>is</i> something you...

10:30.803 --> 10:33.637
Oh, yeah. In fact,
I... I do so many patent cases,

10:33.639 --> 10:36.106
I should probably just go ahead
and specialize already.

10:36.142 --> 10:38.442
[Chuckles] So, what do we got?

10:38.477 --> 10:40.360
Uh, I feel silly asking this. Yeah.

10:40.396 --> 10:42.112
But before I show you my invention,

10:42.148 --> 10:44.448
would you mind signing
a non-disclosure agreement?

10:44.483 --> 10:47.234
You got it. No problem.

10:49.155 --> 10:51.121
It's my idea of a lifetime.

10:51.157 --> 10:53.824
If Fisher-price or Playskool
ever got their hands on this...

10:53.826 --> 10:54.992
No worries.

11:03.502 --> 11:05.002
You ready?

11:12.144 --> 11:15.262
I may have seen one of these before.

11:15.314 --> 11:16.930
Not like this.

11:16.982 --> 11:18.599
This one has this little unit I've added.

11:18.651 --> 11:20.017
This is my invention.

11:20.019 --> 11:21.435
Do you have children?

11:21.487 --> 11:22.819
No.

11:22.855 --> 11:24.521
My wife and I have two boys... 4 and 6.

11:24.523 --> 11:26.690
And let me tell you...
Toilet-training them?

11:26.692 --> 11:28.492
Nightmare, both times.

11:28.590 --> 11:30.723
They just didn't want to use the commode.

11:30.759 --> 11:32.975
So I wired a motion sensor to a voice chip,

11:33.011 --> 11:35.178
and, well, no sense getting all technical,

11:35.230 --> 11:38.181
but it's all about positive reinforcement.

11:38.233 --> 11:40.349
Meet Tony the toilet buddy.

11:40.401 --> 11:43.102
And when you sit down to do your business,

11:43.104 --> 11:45.354
this is how he works.

12:14.469 --> 12:16.135

12:22.477 --> 12:24.227
<i>Ahhh!</i>

12:26.314 --> 12:28.114
Anyway, it goes on from there.

12:28.149 --> 12:29.315
You get the picture.

12:29.317 --> 12:31.818
Yeah, I, uh...

12:33.822 --> 12:35.404
Yeah.

12:35.456 --> 12:38.124
So, what do you think?

12:40.128 --> 12:44.580
It's a little sexual, maybe?

12:44.632 --> 12:46.582
Sexual? What... what does that...

12:46.634 --> 12:47.834
Suggestive, maybe...

12:47.836 --> 12:50.803
Maybe that's a better word. [Chuckles]

12:50.839 --> 12:52.255
Look, I'm not...

12:52.307 --> 12:53.840
I'm not saying
this thing won't make you rich.

12:53.842 --> 12:56.843
I mean, some of your wealthier
pacific rim nations...

12:56.845 --> 12:59.512

12:59.514 --> 13:01.180

13:01.182 --> 13:04.317

Children, understand?

13:04.352 --> 13:05.985
Well, hey,

13:06.020 --> 13:09.772
Viagra was originally invented
to treat hypertension.

13:09.824 --> 13:11.824
Look how that turned out.

13:14.028 --> 13:16.495
You're completely disgusting,
you know that?!

13:16.531 --> 13:18.664
Hey, buddy, you're the one
with the sex toilet.

13:18.700 --> 13:19.866
Get off my property!

13:19.868 --> 13:21.000
Hey, you know what?

13:21.035 --> 13:22.835
I hope you do make a fortune,

13:22.871 --> 13:26.172

to help pay for his therapy!

14:14.339 --> 14:18.224
[Sighing]

14:26.351 --> 14:28.317
[Whirring stops]

14:28.353 --> 14:30.353
[Beeping]

14:30.405 --> 14:32.405
No, no. You just stay put.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.523
I'll be right over.

14:34.575 --> 14:36.108
[Clock ticking]

14:36.110 --> 14:38.527
[Sighs]

14:57.131 --> 14:58.798
Oh.

15:09.978 --> 15:11.944
[Clears throat]

15:11.980 --> 15:14.146
[Breathes deeply]

15:18.319 --> 15:19.652
Now, where were we?

15:19.654 --> 15:21.370
Oh, would you like some more tea?

15:21.406 --> 15:24.040
No! No, thank you. I'm... I'm fine.

15:24.075 --> 15:26.075
Now, the Shepherd boy Hummel...

15:26.127 --> 15:28.577
That's gonna go to your nephew Clarence?

15:28.629 --> 15:30.830
As long as he finishes college. Okay.

15:30.832 --> 15:33.249
If he drops out,
it goes to my niece Raylene.

15:33.301 --> 15:35.468
But then, Raylene doesn't get the girl...

15:35.503 --> 15:37.086
The girl with the geese. Mm.

15:37.138 --> 15:39.005
Yeah. No, then that would go
to your cousin Helen...

15:39.007 --> 15:40.339
Mm-hmm.

15:40.341 --> 15:43.392
So long as she never remarries Frederick?

15:43.428 --> 15:44.927
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

15:44.979 --> 15:48.681
And no matter what,
I want the towheaded twins

15:48.683 --> 15:51.017
to go to Reverend Lawrence's grandson.

15:51.019 --> 15:53.319
Um, don't you mean Reverend Hanes?

15:53.354 --> 15:56.188
'Cause Reverend <i> Lawrence's</i>
grandson is going to get

15:56.190 --> 16:00.409
the, uh, lute-playing angel,
'cause he was in the choir.

16:00.445 --> 16:03.863
Very sharp, Mr. McGill.

16:03.865 --> 16:06.665
And here I thought all lawyers were idiots.

16:06.701 --> 16:08.584
[Chuckles] No, only half of us are idiots.

16:08.619 --> 16:09.869
The other half are crooks.

16:09.871 --> 16:12.171
[Both laugh]

16:12.206 --> 16:15.007
- Aren't you a spicy one?
- Well...

16:15.043 --> 16:16.926
If I were 40 years younger,

16:16.961 --> 16:19.211
I'd have you buy me a piña colada.

16:19.213 --> 16:21.180
Well, if you want me to draw up a DNR,

16:21.215 --> 16:24.016
I'll bring a blender and some pineapple.

16:24.052 --> 16:26.052
[Both laugh] I knew I'd like you

16:26.054 --> 16:29.772
when I saw how you saved
that poor man on the television.

16:29.807 --> 16:31.023
Well...

16:31.059 --> 16:33.893
Moxie is in such short supply these days.

16:33.895 --> 16:34.977
[Sighs] Yeah.

16:35.029 --> 16:37.279
Well, I pride myself on my moxie.

16:37.315 --> 16:39.198
Now, I hate to do this,

16:39.233 --> 16:41.867
but I do need to bring up my payment.

16:41.903 --> 16:44.036
Um [Clears throat] and I'm sorry,

16:44.072 --> 16:46.322
but I can't accept s&h green stamps.

16:46.374 --> 16:48.407
[Chuckles]

16:48.409 --> 16:52.211
Now, uh, my fee is $140.

16:52.246 --> 16:54.980
$140?

16:55.016 --> 16:58.667
I'll gladly accept $70 today

16:58.719 --> 17:00.386
and $70 when I come back

17:00.421 --> 17:02.721
with the completed documents, if...

17:05.226 --> 17:09.395
[Rustling]

17:21.776 --> 17:25.994
$20, $40, $60...

17:26.030 --> 17:31.584
$80, $100...

17:31.619 --> 17:34.870
And $20, $40.

17:36.207 --> 17:38.624
Uh. Okay.

17:38.626 --> 17:39.925
[Clears throat]

17:39.961 --> 17:42.128
[Chuckles]

17:42.130 --> 17:43.846
Shall we continue, Mr. McGill?

17:43.881 --> 17:46.932
Yes. Yes, we shall, Mrs. Strauss.

17:46.968 --> 17:48.134
[Sighs]

17:48.136 --> 17:51.387
Kim: Put it on the nail, not the skin.

17:51.439 --> 17:54.273
Jimmy: I can't help it
if your toes are too small.

17:54.308 --> 17:56.225
They should all be the same size...

17:56.277 --> 17:57.643
The size of the big toe.

17:57.645 --> 17:58.811
That one I can do.

17:58.813 --> 18:00.446
Yeah, that would be attractive.

18:00.481 --> 18:02.731
[Both chuckle]

18:02.783 --> 18:07.236
So... how's it go again?

18:07.288 --> 18:11.457
[Imitating Tony the toilet buddy
] Oh, you're huge, Chandler!

18:11.492 --> 18:13.909
You're a big, big boy!

18:13.961 --> 18:16.745
Oh, where does it end?!

18:16.797 --> 18:18.881
Oh, don't stop, Chandler!

18:18.916 --> 18:20.749
Don't stop! [Laughs]

18:20.801 --> 18:23.419
Oh, here it comes!

18:23.471 --> 18:24.920
Oh, what is that?

18:24.972 --> 18:26.805
- Is that a piece of corn?
- [Laughing] No, don't.

18:26.841 --> 18:28.557
Did you eat corn, Chandler?

18:28.593 --> 18:30.176
- Is that a niblet I see, Chandler?
- That's disgusting.

18:30.178 --> 18:32.428
- No, don't.
- [Normal voice] Too much?

18:32.480 --> 18:34.680
Hey, good times.

18:34.682 --> 18:37.099
Oh. Even your lousy days

18:37.151 --> 18:38.767
are more interesting than my <i> good</i> ones.

18:38.819 --> 18:41.020
Yeah, well, we should definitely
do something about that.

18:44.025 --> 18:46.992
Seriously, don't ever try
to make a living at this.

18:47.028 --> 18:48.577
Stick with the law.

18:48.613 --> 18:51.247
Yeah, because I'm really...

18:51.282 --> 18:53.916
Lighting the world on fire
in that department.

18:53.951 --> 18:56.285
Did two wills today.

18:56.337 --> 18:58.954
Two wills, and I started a living trust.

18:59.006 --> 19:01.173
Whoopee! Old people love me.

19:01.209 --> 19:03.092
Maybe you got a future in elder law.

19:03.127 --> 19:05.294
You think I could handle all that glamour?

19:05.346 --> 19:06.929
No, I'm serious.

19:06.964 --> 19:10.015
I... I've thought about
getting into elder law myself.

19:10.051 --> 19:12.635
I watched my grandmother at the end.

19:12.687 --> 19:14.687
It's...

19:14.722 --> 19:16.972
It's awful what people have to deal with...

19:17.024 --> 19:19.108
Insurance companies,

19:19.143 --> 19:22.861
my scumbag cousins stealing
her savings and her pain meds.

19:22.897 --> 19:25.648
Getting old sucks.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.399
Seniors need someone on their side.

19:29.487 --> 19:31.987
[Cellphone ringing]

19:35.243 --> 19:36.959
It's Howard.

19:36.994 --> 19:39.545
What the hell does <i> he</i> want?

19:39.580 --> 19:42.464
- Shh!
- [Cellphone beeps]

19:42.500 --> 19:44.833
Hi, Howard.

19:44.885 --> 19:49.138
Uh, no. I mean, I haven't, uh...

19:49.173 --> 19:51.640
Oh, my God. When?

19:51.676 --> 19:53.809
Yeah, okay.

19:53.844 --> 19:57.429
I'll see if I can, um, track Jimmy down.

19:57.431 --> 19:59.932
I'll call you back. S-sure.

19:59.934 --> 20:03.185
[Cellphone beeps]

20:03.237 --> 20:04.937
It's Chuck.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.052
[Electricity buzzing]

20:14.635 --> 20:15.918
[Buzzing intensifies]

20:15.934 --> 20:17.401
Jimmy: Chuck.

20:17.434 --> 20:18.566
Chuck, you with me?

20:18.601 --> 20:20.435
Chuck, hey, buddy. It's me.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.084
Hey, can you talk to me? Jim...

20:23.136 --> 20:26.387
Jesus Christ. These sons of bitches.

20:26.423 --> 20:27.639
[Breathing sharply]

20:27.674 --> 20:29.924
Hey, hey. Sir, you can't do that.

20:29.976 --> 20:32.810
- All of this needs to stay on.
- No, no. No electricity.

20:32.846 --> 20:35.297
- You understand?
- No, it needs to be on.

20:35.345 --> 20:37.098
- I'm getting security.
- No, uh, wait, wait.

20:37.150 --> 20:38.516
Wait, wait. Uh, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:38.518 --> 20:39.918
Jimmy: Huh? Why isn't that one going out?

20:39.953 --> 20:42.437
- Jimmy. Jimmy.
- Damn it.

20:42.489 --> 20:45.273
I just... Jimmy, wait a second.
Jimmy. Think.

20:45.325 --> 20:49.110
- What's the plan here?
- Sir? Sir?

20:49.162 --> 20:50.995
Sir, I need you to get down from there.

20:51.031 --> 20:52.947
What the hell kind of torture
chamber you running here?

20:52.999 --> 20:54.782
He... he's allergic
to electricity, all right?

20:54.834 --> 20:57.201
- You heard the doc. Get down now.
- No, all these lights and machines...

20:57.203 --> 20:58.536
You might as well throw him
into a microwave.

20:58.588 --> 20:59.871
- Come on down now.
- No, don't touch me!

20:59.923 --> 21:03.174
He is this patient's brother.
Please, listen to him.

21:03.209 --> 21:04.676
[Remote control beeps]

21:04.711 --> 21:06.878
[Breathing heavily]

21:06.880 --> 21:09.097
- Let's go.
- Dr. Cruz: Hey. Wait, Edwin, hold up.

21:09.132 --> 21:10.431
Hold on a second, Edwin.

21:10.467 --> 21:12.801
Sir, are you ready to calm down now?

21:12.830 --> 21:15.429
Yes. His name is Jimmy, and,
yes, he is gonna calm down.

21:15.430 --> 21:16.762
I need you to say the words, Jimmy.

21:16.797 --> 21:18.430
I need to hear it from you.

21:18.465 --> 21:20.048
I'm calm, okay? I'm calm.

21:21.435 --> 21:23.468
Edwin, why don't you
go wait in the hallway?

21:23.470 --> 21:25.938
I'll call if we need you.

21:25.973 --> 21:30.192
Okay, so, tell me about the electricity.

21:30.227 --> 21:33.529
Yeah, look, I know how
it sounds, but it's real.

21:33.564 --> 21:35.147
Oh, shit.

21:35.149 --> 21:38.567
My phone and stuff...
Anything with a battery in it...

21:38.619 --> 21:40.285
He can't have it near him.

21:40.321 --> 21:42.538
Hang on.

21:42.573 --> 21:45.073
Here's my phone. Okay, that's it.

21:45.125 --> 21:48.126
[Breathing heavily] Thanks.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.750
Okay, what the hell happened to him?

21:54.802 --> 21:56.585
- Why is he here?
- Apparently, it started

21:56.637 --> 21:58.670
when Charles stole
his neighbor's newspaper.

21:58.672 --> 22:00.756
What? He... he never leaves the house.

22:00.808 --> 22:02.474
I don't... I don't have all the details,

22:02.509 --> 22:04.560
but the police found him
in a very agitated state.

22:04.595 --> 22:07.479
He was confrontational and incoherent.

22:07.514 --> 22:08.814
How come you didn't call me?

22:08.849 --> 22:10.566
Uh, why did I have to hear about this

22:10.601 --> 22:13.602
through my brother's
prick of a law partner?

22:13.654 --> 22:15.153
The only contact information we could find

22:15.189 --> 22:17.155
was a business card.

22:17.191 --> 22:21.193
Jimmy, in my opinion,
Charles should be committed

22:21.195 --> 22:24.696
for 30 days of psychiatric observation.

22:24.698 --> 22:26.164
As a family member,

22:26.200 --> 22:29.034
you can submit a petition
for him to be evaluated.

22:29.036 --> 22:31.536
There's an excellent facility
in Las Cruces.

22:31.538 --> 22:34.840
He can be there tomorrow.

22:34.875 --> 22:36.959
I'd rather not. [Breathes deeply]

22:37.011 --> 22:39.962
Hey, buddy. Hey, I'm right here.

22:40.014 --> 22:41.013
Oh, hey, Chuck.

22:41.048 --> 22:42.931
Excuse me.

22:42.967 --> 22:45.601
Mr. McGill, my name is Dr. Cruz.

22:45.636 --> 22:47.302
Do you know why you're in the hospital?

22:47.354 --> 22:52.808
The police kicked in my door...
No warrant, no cause.

22:52.860 --> 22:54.142
I wasn't incoherent.

22:54.194 --> 22:55.811
They just weren't listening.

22:55.863 --> 22:58.063
They tasered me, Jimmy.

22:58.065 --> 22:59.615
Aw, Jesus.

22:59.650 --> 23:02.067
Kim?

23:02.069 --> 23:04.236
I'm sorry. I can give you privacy.

23:04.238 --> 23:06.405
Oh, no, no, no. That's all right. Stay.

23:06.407 --> 23:08.123
Howard... Called me.

23:08.158 --> 23:09.908
He's very concerned about you.

23:09.910 --> 23:12.494
How are you feeling now, Mr. McGill?

23:12.546 --> 23:15.414
Uh, do... do you have a phone
or a... a pager,

23:15.416 --> 23:17.082
anything with a battery?

23:17.084 --> 23:19.751
I don't think so. I...

23:21.588 --> 23:23.255
Uh...

23:24.091 --> 23:26.141
Yeah. [Chuckles]

23:26.176 --> 23:28.260
- [Breathing quickly]
- Oversight. Sorry about that.

23:30.564 --> 23:34.316
Can you tell me a little more
about your... Situation?

23:34.351 --> 23:36.518
It's not a situation.

23:36.570 --> 23:38.570
It's a condition...

23:38.605 --> 23:40.856
Electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

23:40.908 --> 23:44.526
For reasons unknown, my nervous
system has become sensitized

23:44.578 --> 23:47.746
to certain frequencies
of electromagnetic radiation.

23:47.781 --> 23:50.415
Your brother called it
an allergy to electricity.

23:50.451 --> 23:52.334
Well, it's an oversimplification,

23:52.369 --> 23:54.920
but it's essentially correct.

23:54.955 --> 24:00.693
Electronic devices create their
own electromagnetic fields.

24:01.128 --> 24:05.097
The closer I am to such devices,
the worse my symptoms.

24:05.132 --> 24:06.548
Which are?

24:06.600 --> 24:09.051
Burning sensation on my skin,

24:09.103 --> 24:12.137
a sharp, cold pain in my bones,

24:12.139 --> 24:15.190
muscle fatigue, heart palpitations,

24:15.225 --> 24:17.526
blurred vision, tinnitus,

24:17.561 --> 24:20.862
vertigo, nausea, shortness of breath,

24:20.898 --> 24:23.115
a general... it hurts.

24:23.150 --> 24:24.900
Yes, it hurts.

24:24.952 --> 24:27.652
When did you first experience
these symptoms?

24:27.654 --> 24:29.905
[Sighs] Oh, it must have been...

24:29.957 --> 24:33.408
Y... you left the office 18 months ago.

24:33.460 --> 24:37.162
Huh. Well, in that case, uh,
must have been almost two years.

24:37.164 --> 24:38.880
- Two years?
- Mm-hmm.

24:38.916 --> 24:41.583
That's a... that's a long time
to live with discomfort.

24:41.635 --> 24:42.834
Oh, there it is.

24:44.505 --> 24:47.005
You think I'm crazy.

24:47.007 --> 24:49.141
I never said that.

24:49.176 --> 24:51.309
No, you didn't, because you're very polite,

24:51.345 --> 24:52.928
but you think it.

24:52.980 --> 24:55.313
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
talking about commitment.

24:55.349 --> 24:57.099
You find that idea distressing.

24:57.151 --> 24:58.600
Who the hell wouldn't?

24:58.652 --> 25:01.153
I... I find it inappropriate

25:01.188 --> 25:05.090
for a person suffering from
a physical condition.

[Breathes deeply]

25:07.194 --> 25:09.528
Anyone who's spent more than
a few minutes with me

25:09.530 --> 25:12.447
knows that this isn't
some kind of delusion.

25:12.499 --> 25:13.698
Wouldn't you agree, Kim?

25:13.700 --> 25:15.500
Jimmy: Of course she does.

25:15.536 --> 25:17.202
Well, I'm not a doctor.

25:17.204 --> 25:19.671
You've known me for
the better part of a decade.

25:19.706 --> 25:21.757
Have you ever seen me exhibit any sign...

25:21.792 --> 25:24.259
Any sign whatsoever of mental illness?

25:24.294 --> 25:25.761
See?

25:25.796 --> 25:27.712
If I thought for one second
you could cure me,

25:27.714 --> 25:30.549
believe me, I'd jump at the chance.

25:30.551 --> 25:31.716
But with all due respect,

25:31.718 --> 25:33.218
psychiatry doesn't have the answers.

25:33.220 --> 25:34.719
I'd very much like to try.

25:34.721 --> 25:38.523
Section 43-1-11, part (E)(3)...

25:38.559 --> 25:40.559
"The proposed commitment is consistent with

25:40.561 --> 25:42.644
"the treatment needs of the client

25:42.696 --> 25:46.148
and with the least drastic means
principle."

25:46.200 --> 25:50.068
Chuck: Do you think subjecting me
to this kind of pain for a month

25:50.070 --> 25:51.486
is the least drastic means?

25:51.538 --> 25:53.572
He might as well spend
a month in a wood chipper.

25:55.492 --> 25:59.461
Dr. Cruz: I understand
your frustration. I do.

25:59.496 --> 26:02.714
You're obviously a highly intelligent man

26:02.749 --> 26:07.085
in difficult circumstances.

26:07.087 --> 26:10.388
May I ask you a question,
just for my own interest?

26:10.424 --> 26:13.725
How do you meet the needs of daily life?

26:13.760 --> 26:15.310
What do you do for light, or...

26:15.345 --> 26:16.928
How do you prepare food?

26:16.930 --> 26:19.681
[Sighs] I use white-gas lanterns.

26:19.733 --> 26:21.266
For cooking, I have a camp stove.

26:21.268 --> 26:24.069
I have a large cooler
I keep filled with ice.

26:24.104 --> 26:28.073
It's not ideal, but I make do.

26:28.108 --> 26:29.357
I see.

26:29.409 --> 26:31.693
Well, thank you.

26:31.745 --> 26:33.528
Would you mind if I took a moment

26:33.580 --> 26:35.947
to speak with your brother?

26:35.949 --> 26:38.783
Oh, uh, make sure you still have
your wallet when you're done.

26:38.785 --> 26:41.203
[Chuckles] Funny guy.

26:41.255 --> 26:42.621
Jimmy.

26:44.708 --> 26:47.926
[Sighs] I want to go home.

26:55.135 --> 26:56.852
[Intercom chatter]

26:56.887 --> 26:58.220
That was a dirty trick.

26:58.272 --> 27:00.605
That wasn't a trick...
It was a demonstration.

27:00.641 --> 27:03.058
This allergy to electricity isn't real...

27:03.110 --> 27:05.227
It's a manifestation of something deeper.

27:05.279 --> 27:06.862
I'm not saying it's 100% real, okay?

27:06.897 --> 27:09.231
But Chuck is smarter than you
and me put together,

27:09.283 --> 27:11.066
so we're not talking him out of this,

27:11.118 --> 27:13.869
and I'm not sending him to a rubber room.

27:13.904 --> 27:15.904
No one is talking about rubber rooms.

27:15.956 --> 27:17.038
There are specialists who will...

27:17.074 --> 27:18.290
He's seen specialists, okay?

27:18.325 --> 27:19.824
The best doctors from here to Denver,

27:19.826 --> 27:21.293
and none of them helped... not one.

27:21.328 --> 27:22.544
So you're ready to give up.

27:22.579 --> 27:24.713
[Scoffs] Who's giving up, huh?

27:24.748 --> 27:27.716
I'm... I'm the one
doing the heavy lifting here.

27:27.751 --> 27:29.301
That white gas he was talking about...

27:29.336 --> 27:30.719
Who do you think brings him that?

27:30.754 --> 27:32.387
And milk and bread and toilet paper

27:32.422 --> 27:34.422
and ice and every other
damn thing he needs.

27:34.474 --> 27:38.226
Is that helping or enabling?

27:38.262 --> 27:40.562
If you testify in a custodial hearing,

27:40.597 --> 27:42.898
he can get the help he needs...
That's in your power.

27:42.933 --> 27:44.816
To be committed involuntarily,

27:44.851 --> 27:46.818
he has to be a danger to himself or others.

27:46.853 --> 27:48.320
And he is.

27:48.355 --> 27:51.323
Coleman lanterns indoors, a camp stove?

27:51.358 --> 27:53.024
I mean, he could burn his house down

27:53.026 --> 27:55.243
or the entire neighborhood,

27:55.279 --> 27:57.746
and then you're looking at
a commitment of 10 to 20 years.

27:57.781 --> 27:59.281
What if...

27:59.333 --> 28:01.366
What if he just hurts himself
in a household accident?

28:01.368 --> 28:03.535
How does he call for help?

28:06.039 --> 28:08.506
You have the power to help your brother...

28:08.542 --> 28:11.042
Truly help him.

28:13.297 --> 28:15.380
Ignoring this won't make it go away.

28:20.137 --> 28:22.887
What would <i> you</i> do?

28:24.224 --> 28:26.107
All I know is...

28:26.143 --> 28:27.642
He needs help.

28:29.196 --> 28:31.196
[Sighs]

28:37.037 --> 28:38.069
Untie him.

28:38.071 --> 28:39.704
I'm getting him out of here.

28:43.076 --> 28:44.826
A nurse will bring you the release forms.

28:53.003 --> 28:55.503
[Keys jingling]

28:58.892 --> 29:00.925
Oh, boy.

29:02.346 --> 29:04.095
Jimmy. Jimmy. I found him.

29:04.097 --> 29:06.598
I thought I'd wait till you got here.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.266
Great. How's he doing?

29:08.268 --> 29:09.934
Better. Resting.

29:09.936 --> 29:12.153
Good.

29:12.189 --> 29:14.606
Uh, Jimmy...

29:14.608 --> 29:16.574
I want you to know
that I've talked to the D.A.,

29:16.610 --> 29:20.245
and he absolutely will not sign
off on any commitment papers.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.497
This is a <i> physical</i> condition,
not a mental one.

29:22.532 --> 29:23.915
Chuck is of sound mind.

29:23.950 --> 29:26.034
I think we can all agree on that.

29:26.086 --> 29:27.118
[Scoffs]

29:27.120 --> 29:29.170
You're a real peach, Howard.

29:29.206 --> 29:31.339
Of course you don't want Chuck committed.

29:31.375 --> 29:33.875
No, I don't. Why would I?

29:33.927 --> 29:35.877
Because if Chuck were committed,

29:35.929 --> 29:37.345
then I'd become his legal guardian,

29:37.381 --> 29:38.513
and I cash him out of HHM.

29:38.548 --> 29:40.015
Jesus, Jimmy. Now?

29:40.050 --> 29:41.683
You want to hash that out
while he's lying in here?

29:41.718 --> 29:43.268
You know, the tanning bed
must have melted your brain

29:43.303 --> 29:44.602
if you think for one second...

29:44.638 --> 29:46.971
Guys... Chuck. That's why we're here.

29:46.973 --> 29:49.224
Yes. Let's stay on point.

29:49.276 --> 29:51.393
We're talking about the well-being of a man

29:51.445 --> 29:52.894
whom we all love very much.

29:52.946 --> 29:54.479
There's many factors at play.

29:54.481 --> 29:55.980
Spite doesn't have to be one of them.

29:55.982 --> 29:57.365
You know what, Howard?

29:57.401 --> 29:58.616
I was on the fence till you showed up,

29:58.652 --> 29:59.951
but thanks for helping me decide.

29:59.986 --> 30:01.986
Wave bye-bye to your cash cow,

30:01.988 --> 30:04.122
'cause it's leaving the pasture.

30:04.157 --> 30:05.407
I'm committing him.

30:09.663 --> 30:11.746
Jimmy. Uh, j... wait.

30:11.798 --> 30:13.832
Jimmy, wait. Jimmy.

30:13.834 --> 30:15.800
Jimmy, can you wait?

30:15.836 --> 30:17.752
Jimmy, wait a second.

30:17.804 --> 30:19.637
Listen, I agree that Chuck needs help,

30:19.673 --> 30:21.473
and maybe it's the right thing to do,

30:21.508 --> 30:23.007
but you can't do it like this.

30:23.009 --> 30:25.844
I just want to see
that son of a bitch sweat.

30:25.846 --> 30:28.813
It's so obvious what he's afraid of.

30:28.849 --> 30:31.483
I'm taking my brother home.

30:46.554 --> 30:47.953
- Yeah.
- There you go.

30:47.989 --> 30:50.272
Okay, some steps. One and two.

30:50.308 --> 30:51.640
And there you go.

30:51.692 --> 30:53.976
Hey, you're home, all right?

30:54.028 --> 30:57.279
Everything's gonna be all right.

30:57.315 --> 30:59.398
Uh, you want something to eat...

30:59.400 --> 31:01.734
Uh, some tea... a cup of tea?

31:01.736 --> 31:04.203
- Coffee?
- [Sighs] Yeah.

31:04.238 --> 31:06.539
Coffee. Coffee it is.

31:06.574 --> 31:09.492

[Groaning]

32:00.962 --> 32:02.294
You want to talk about this?

32:04.048 --> 32:06.215
- There's nothing to talk about.
- You took the paper.

32:06.267 --> 32:07.466
You saw this.

32:07.468 --> 32:10.686
You got sick.

32:10.721 --> 32:12.388
What's your point?

32:12.440 --> 32:17.059
Chuck, I think you got sick
'cause you saw this story.

32:17.111 --> 32:20.312
No, w... whenever you think
I've done something wrong,

32:20.314 --> 32:23.065
something questionable, you get worse.

32:23.117 --> 32:24.400
I didn't get sick

32:24.452 --> 32:25.734
because I read about you in the paper.

32:25.786 --> 32:27.236
I got sick

32:27.288 --> 32:29.788
because I went out of my house
to retrieve the paper.

32:29.824 --> 32:31.957
W... [sighs]

32:31.993 --> 32:34.293

32:34.328 --> 32:36.212

32:36.247 --> 32:38.581
You think this is the return
of slippin' Jimmy,

32:38.633 --> 32:41.050
but it's not. All right.

32:41.085 --> 32:44.920
Uh, you think the
billboard thing was unethical,

32:44.972 --> 32:47.006
but it was... Promotion.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.807
It was advertising... that's all.

32:48.843 --> 32:51.477
Which wasn't even allowed until
five supreme court justices

32:51.512 --> 32:54.263
went completely bonkers in
Bates vs. State bar of Arizona.

32:54.315 --> 32:55.731
Aha!

32:55.766 --> 32:57.816
But in any event...

32:57.852 --> 32:59.235
It's legal.

32:59.270 --> 33:01.520
If you want to advertise,
that's your business.

33:01.522 --> 33:04.156
"Business" being
the operative word there, Chuck,

33:04.191 --> 33:06.525
because I-I <i> have</i> gotten business
off of this...

33:06.527 --> 33:10.112
Legit business... wills, uh, trusts.

33:10.164 --> 33:14.617

to specialize in elder law.

33:14.669 --> 33:16.118

33:16.170 --> 33:17.920
Yeah, the things the elderly
have to deal with...

33:17.955 --> 33:20.956

coming after their savings,

33:21.008 --> 33:23.592

33:23.628 --> 33:25.594
I mean, getting old sucks.

33:25.630 --> 33:28.297
Seniors need someone on their side, so...

33:28.349 --> 33:30.599
You're looking at him.

33:30.635 --> 33:33.636
Well, that sounds...

33:33.688 --> 33:35.387
Promising.

33:35.389 --> 33:38.223
But it has nothing to do with my condition.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.859
Chuck, listen. I'm gonna make
you a promise right now, okay?

33:40.895 --> 33:44.910
- No, not necessary, not requested.
- Okay.

33:44.994 --> 33:46.878
The billboard was a one-time thing.

33:46.913 --> 33:48.296
I... I'm a good lawyer.

33:48.331 --> 33:50.298
I just needed some razzmatazz, you know,

33:50.333 --> 33:52.333
to get the ball rolling,
some showmanship...

33:52.335 --> 33:53.418

33:53.470 --> 33:54.953

33:54.969 --> 33:55.785
All right.

33:55.869 --> 33:57.502
From here on out,
I'm gonna play by the rules.

33:58.269 --> 33:59.936
As any lawyer should.

33:59.938 --> 34:01.270
