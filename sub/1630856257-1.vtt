Hey, Tom.

01:08.836 --> 01:09.903
Tom?

01:09.903 --> 01:11.372
Tom!

01:17.911 --> 01:20.514
Charlie.

01:20.514 --> 01:21.982
When's the last time I saw ya?

01:21.982 --> 01:25.819
I can't--
I can't even remember.

01:25.819 --> 01:29.957
Uh, Mattapoisett
package store last summer.

01:31.259 --> 01:32.893
How's Mom?

01:32.893 --> 01:34.728
She's good.

01:34.728 --> 01:37.398
I think she wonders
why you never come by.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.500
Your father
still lives there, right?

01:43.237 --> 01:45.506
What's up?

01:45.506 --> 01:46.940
Why are you down here?

01:52.546 --> 01:53.747
Oh, boy.

01:55.983 --> 01:58.586
I was wondering, maybe you
needed an extra deckhand.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.621
Deckhand?

02:00.621 --> 02:03.524
Ch--Charlie--
Charlie, are ya--

02:03.524 --> 02:05.125
you're supposed
to be in college.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.927
If you dropped out, I'm gonna
wring your fucking neck.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.496
No, I graduated
three weeks ago.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.631
Well, this is fish school,

02:10.631 --> 02:12.866
North Atlantic University.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.902
The answer's no.
Let me buy you lunch.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.638
No.
No, I just had lunch.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.308
I wanna go fishing.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.575
Why?

02:21.575 --> 02:23.043
- I'm curious.
- Curious about what?

02:23.043 --> 02:25.112
Pumping it every day?
Pumping it for 24 hours a day?

02:25.112 --> 02:26.280
Working for a living?

02:26.280 --> 02:27.515
Not taking a shower
for ten days?

02:27.515 --> 02:28.982
Curious about what, Charlie?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.251
About me.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.723
About you, too, maybe.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.594
You're my brother.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.964
You have to take me.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.371
Finest kind.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.241
<i>Welcome aboard, college boy.</i>

02:53.241 --> 02:55.008
<i>I'll give you the tour.</i>

02:55.008 --> 02:58.111
Some basics:
where we're walking is forward.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.179
Back is aft.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.514
Right is starboard.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.849
Left is port.

03:01.849 --> 03:06.420
Watch your head
coming through here.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.588
Over here is the shitter.

03:07.588 --> 03:08.856
You can also call it the head.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.491
Don't call it the toilet.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.494
And you,
as our new half-share shacker,

03:13.494 --> 03:14.828
you're gonna take great pride

03:14.828 --> 03:16.464
in keeping it sparkling clean.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.268
Over here on the right
is Nunesy.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.503
Meet Tom's brother Charlie,
our new shacker.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.572
- How you doing?
- Hey.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.508
You--you said to the right?

03:27.508 --> 03:29.042
Huh?

03:29.042 --> 03:33.681
You should have said starboard.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.716
You being smart
with me, shacker?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.251
No, I just--
I like the idea.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.852
It doesn't matter
which way you're facing.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.688
Starboard is starboard.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.291
You know what, Skeemo?

03:43.291 --> 03:46.994
He kind of looks a little
like Justin Bieber, doesn't he?

03:46.994 --> 03:49.263
Yeah.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.131
You're right.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.966
You guys could be twins.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.370
Yeah.

03:59.607 --> 04:03.411
I don't like Justin Bieber.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.078
Neither do I.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.384
Okay.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.522
You guys are missing out.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.559
Ah-ha, you think
you're funny.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.793
Guess what?

04:19.793 --> 04:20.894
You're getting a haircut.

04:20.894 --> 04:21.895
Nunesy?
- Yeah?

04:21.895 --> 04:22.963
Get me the clippers.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.301
<i>Ha-ha, you look beautiful,
Charlie boy.</i>

04:27.301 --> 04:28.902
<i>You in the Navy now.</i>

04:54.595 --> 04:57.164
Charlie!

05:01.802 --> 05:03.404
<i>Mayday, mayday, mayday.</i>

05:03.404 --> 05:05.673
<i>This is "Harmony,"
"Harmony," "Harmony."</i>

05:05.673 --> 05:08.041
<i>We have a hole in the hull,
and we're going down quick.</i>

05:08.041 --> 05:12.880
<i>My position is latitude
40-49, longitude 69...</i>

05:16.850 --> 05:18.919
<i> I tell you, man.</i>

05:18.919 --> 05:20.287
<i>This shit right here,</i>

05:20.287 --> 05:21.889
<i>this bouncing around shit
right here,</i>

05:21.889 --> 05:23.657
this is why my old man

05:23.657 --> 05:25.559
wanted me to be a doctor.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.095
I had to tell him, "Dad,

05:28.095 --> 05:31.432
I ain't even gonna graduate
from goddamn high school."

05:33.434 --> 05:37.204
I don't even think
he was paying attention.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.072
At least
your father was home.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.274
- Fuck.
- Oh, man.

05:41.274 --> 05:45.413
My father was home
all the goddamn time,

05:45.413 --> 05:47.581
hating us every inch of it.

05:47.581 --> 05:50.183
Now, the only thing killing
his party when my mama died

05:50.183 --> 05:52.820
was that us kids
didn't die with her.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.222
So yeah,
he was home, all right.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.691
Finest kind.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.593
You wanted a hero, Costa.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.295
All you got was another guy
trying to figure it out.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.297
Hey, man.
I--I got a question.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.799
What the hell
does "finest kind" mean?

06:05.799 --> 06:07.901
You guys are always saying it.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.771
It's an expression
of the trade, my man.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.372
Yeah, but it means
something different

06:12.372 --> 06:13.541
every time you say it.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.608
Hmm.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.410
That's the beauty of it.

06:16.410 --> 06:19.713
Like, sometimes
it can mean "cool."

06:19.713 --> 06:22.416
Sometimes it can mean
"fuck you."

06:22.416 --> 06:25.586
It just depends
on how you say it.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.221
All right, it's
the Swiss Army Knife of words,

06:28.221 --> 06:31.324
perfect for an English major.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.595
- Oh, there we go.
- Oh, yeah.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.564
- Oh!
- All right.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.065
Very nice.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.833
<i>Rescue efforts
extended through the night</i>

06:39.833 --> 06:41.368
<i>as the Coast Guard search</i>

<i>The names
of the crew members...</i>

07:03.491 --> 07:04.525
<i>Over.</i>

07:06.960 --> 07:08.729
We're not dead yet!

07:11.298 --> 07:13.634
Hey!

07:18.972 --> 07:20.674
Keep staying on, Bravo One.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.909
You're straight on it.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.444
Check with the IEC.

07:26.714 --> 07:29.016
Hey!
Are you our Uber?

07:37.057 --> 07:39.226
- You see yet?
- I see it.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.127
Okay!

07:40.127 --> 07:42.129
You keep holding on!

07:46.667 --> 07:48.168
Yeah!

07:48.168 --> 07:49.737
Yes!

07:49.737 --> 07:51.572
I'm alive!

07:51.572 --> 07:52.973
Yeah!

- Fellas!
- We have risen.

08:14.361 --> 08:15.529
You have risen!

08:15.529 --> 08:16.630
What the hell happened?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.031
Oh, man.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.633
Ah, just another tough day
in the office.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.768
Yeah, I'd say.

08:20.768 --> 08:21.869
I guess so.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.236
Okay, there was a boat,

08:23.236 --> 08:25.573
and then there was no boat.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.975
- Damn.
- Yep.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.176
So good to see your face,

this little label right here?

10:55.088 --> 10:56.790
Sure.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.325
Bullshit.

11:00.627 --> 11:03.463
What about right here?
- Mm.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.899
I don't know.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.969
Is it a bet?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.771
Okay, 20 bucks?

11:10.771 --> 11:11.972
20 bucks.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.106
The top line?

11:13.106 --> 11:15.876
Yeah.

11:15.876 --> 11:19.346
All right.
Don't fucking move it.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.148
- Okay, all right.
- I'm trying to concentrate.

11:23.884 --> 11:27.154
"This is

11:27.154 --> 11:32.760
"the famous Budweiser beer.

11:32.760 --> 11:37.530
"We know of no brand

11:37.530 --> 11:40.033
"produced by any other brewer

11:40.033 --> 11:43.670
which costs so much to brew
and age."

11:43.670 --> 11:45.672
Oh, you memorized
that, motherfucker.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.107
- Oh!
- Oh!

11:47.107 --> 11:48.641
- Yeah!
- That's right.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.077
Yeah, Tom!

12:07.694 --> 12:08.929
Rocky.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.363
Another round, man.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.965
We're not dead yet, baby.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.767
We're not dead yet.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.602
Not dead yet.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.004
Not dead yet!

12:17.004 --> 12:19.139
all: Not dead yet!

12:19.139 --> 12:23.010
Not dead yet!

12:23.010 --> 12:24.511
Skeemo.
all: Not dead yet!

12:24.511 --> 12:26.413
Hey.
all: Not dead yet!

12:26.413 --> 12:27.680
Mabel "Black Label."

12:27.680 --> 12:29.883
all: Not dead yet!

12:29.883 --> 12:41.228
Not dead yet!
Not dead yet!

12:41.228 --> 12:46.233
Not dead yet!
- Not dead--hey, Dad.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.068
Not dead--

12:48.068 --> 12:49.937
Hey, Mr. Sykes.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.071
Want a beer?

12:51.071 --> 12:54.274
No, I don't want a beer, Tom.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.876
It's 11:00 in the morning.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.477
What did--
what did you do to your hair?

12:57.477 --> 12:58.745
Oh, I've, uh--

12:58.745 --> 13:01.281
You know what?
For Christ's sake, Charlie.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.782
Dad, we're just celebrating.
That's all.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.085
I mean, we--
we had a rough night.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.286
Yeah, I know.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.687
Your mother is going
out of her mind

13:07.687 --> 13:09.389
worrying about you.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.824
Did she ask about me?

13:10.824 --> 13:12.292
I was in danger too.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.261
I didn't like this idea
from the start,

13:14.261 --> 13:16.629
but now you've had your taste.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.366
You can come clerk with me
for the rest of the summer.

13:19.366 --> 13:22.102
Dad, I'm--
I'm going back again.

13:22.102 --> 13:25.138
Ex--excuse me?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.875
I'm going again.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.910
I'm going back to sea.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.379
I mean, as soon as
we get another, uh--

13:32.379 --> 13:33.780
what do ya call it?

13:33.780 --> 13:34.882
Go for it.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.986
What's it called?

13:38.986 --> 13:40.187
What is it?
It's--

13:40.187 --> 13:41.321
- Site, Charlie.
- Site.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.489
As soon as we
get another site.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.024
You know, Tom, your brother

13:44.024 --> 13:46.894
has a chance to be something.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.261
What, a substitute teacher?

13:48.261 --> 13:49.662
He's got an English degree.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.433
He got accepted

13:53.433 --> 13:55.102
to Boston University
law school,

13:55.102 --> 13:56.403
for Christ's sake.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.738
He starts in September.

13:58.738 --> 14:03.076
I--I admire that you wanna pay
your own way,

14:03.076 --> 14:04.077
but I don't want you fishing.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.512
Dad, I'm 22 years old.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.614
And I'd like to see
you make it to 23.

14:07.614 --> 14:08.715
Wise up!

14:08.715 --> 14:09.716
Hey.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.053
These boys almost drowned
last night.

14:13.786 --> 14:16.489
You should be hugging
your boy, not yelling at him.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.260
Just saying.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.136
Who are you?

14:29.136 --> 14:30.370
Nunesy.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.607
Jesus Christ.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.979
Okay, uh, I'm late
for a meeting.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.413
Go see your mother.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.848
She's worried sick.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.187
Cool guy.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.889
I like him.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.627
Law school?

14:54.627 --> 14:56.629
For you?
Is that for real?

14:59.532 --> 15:01.334
You're gonna learn
to sue people and shit?

15:04.237 --> 15:05.738
I'ma do my best.

15:25.892 --> 15:26.826
Back in a minute.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.061
Stay in the car.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.905
You can take a seat.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.407
I'm good.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.350
One sec.
Just bring it out.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.884
Bring it out.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.386
Eh, screw this.

16:14.741 --> 16:19.079
I was wondering when you'd
find the time to come see me.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.448
I had a few stops to make.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.749
In what goddamn world

16:22.749 --> 16:24.351
do you get away
with that attitude?

16:24.351 --> 16:26.086
Where the hell have you been?
I've been waiting all morning.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.555
The reason I didn't come
in here first thing

16:28.555 --> 16:30.690
was so I could chill out,

16:30.690 --> 16:33.526
so I wouldn't come in here
and kill you.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.296
I wanna see the maintenance
records on the boat.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.997
- Excuse me?
- The "Harmony."

16:37.997 --> 16:39.332
Get the file out.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.500
Let's take a look
at it right now.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.202
You've got
some nerve, Eldridge.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.236
Is it here?

16:43.236 --> 16:44.871
Zero accountability.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.639
Blame your damn shortcomings
on everyone else.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.208
I wanna see
the maintenance record

16:48.208 --> 16:50.743
on the fucking boat!

16:50.743 --> 16:55.182
Unlike you,
that boat was shipshape.

16:55.182 --> 16:58.118
Crankcase exploded.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.153
I'm assuming it
was the, uh, oh, bearings

17:00.153 --> 17:01.421
you said you were gonna replace

17:01.421 --> 17:02.889
or a leaky piston ring
let a spark in.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.491
But either way, it's because
you didn't do your job.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.492
You didn't maintain it.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.693
I most certainly did!

17:06.693 --> 17:08.661
You didn't do
the fucking work!

17:08.661 --> 17:09.629
Fuck it.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.498
Right, typical Tom Eldridge.

17:11.498 --> 17:15.835
Walk out--on me, the boat,
yourself, your crew.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.937
You have a respons--
whoa!

17:17.937 --> 17:19.906
Tom! Tom!

17:19.906 --> 17:21.741
We were out in that storm
with a hole in our belly.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.410
I've never--
- Fuck off!

17:23.410 --> 17:24.677
I've never seen a boat
take on water that fast.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.079
I mean, the bitch went down.

17:28.581 --> 17:29.849
You have
an investment out there.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.284
I got my crew.
I got my brother.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.385
We could have died.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.653
I'm calling the police.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.089
Hold on, Karen.
One second.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.924
Go on, hothead.

17:37.924 --> 17:39.492
Hit me.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.728
Yeah.
- Yeah? Huh?

17:41.728 --> 17:43.496
I'd love to see you
locked up.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.732
Tom, don't!

17:45.732 --> 17:47.634
It'd be a waste
of a good punch.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.074
Take a goddamn shower.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.075
You stink.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.444
Like fish.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.678
A bunch of us guys
stinking like fish

17:58.678 --> 18:02.282
made you a millionaire.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.351
Is that his car?

18:04.351 --> 18:05.818
Yeah.

18:20.367 --> 18:23.035
Now he can smell
like the money too.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.756
Man, when do we
go fishing again?

18:46.025 --> 18:48.395
Might be a little while
until we get another boat.

18:48.395 --> 18:51.063
Why?

18:51.063 --> 18:52.732
It wasn't your fault.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.036
Well, that's not the word
ol' Whitey's

18:57.036 --> 18:59.005
gonna put out there.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.173
Your Dad's right.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.342
You should probably clerk.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.543
Fuck me.

19:05.578 --> 19:09.382
I gotta hear this
from you now?

19:09.382 --> 19:10.483
Man, you know,
when I was little,

19:10.483 --> 19:13.286
you never told me what to do.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.621
No?

19:14.621 --> 19:16.055
No, you--you, like--

19:16.055 --> 19:19.192
you'd either ignore me,
or you took me with you,

19:19.192 --> 19:20.593
and you showed me stuff:

19:20.593 --> 19:23.363
how to jump bikes,

19:23.363 --> 19:25.632
how to water ski,

19:25.632 --> 19:27.400
how to light firecrackers.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.768
Oh, yeah.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.069
And how to know
when to throw 'em.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.471
Know where
the emergency room was.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.173
Yeah.
Yeah.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.908
I always knew where I stood
with you, you know?

19:35.908 --> 19:38.945
Get lost, or get over here.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.747
Simple.

19:40.747 --> 19:44.417
And the--the "get lost"
never felt personal.

19:45.151 --> 19:48.921
But the "get over here"
always did.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.947
You boys.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.683
Mom.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.551
Oh, I knew you'd be okay.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.587
You were together.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.722
I couldn't lose
both of you at once.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.095
I had you early and you late.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.398
And I always hoped
you'd find each other grown up,

20:31.398 --> 20:33.266
but just not like this.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.667
Oh.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.235
Okay.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.237
All right.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.880
Your toilet broke?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.884
Just trying
to save on septic.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.389
Why'd you park so far away?

21:29.389 --> 21:31.223
Didn't wanna wake up Kathy.

21:31.223 --> 21:32.825
She hasn't lived here
in six months.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.727
I mean, she moved out.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.263
That's too bad.

21:37.263 --> 21:38.831
I liked her.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.500
I can give you
her phone number.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.335
You--you can ask her out.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.106
How you doing otherwise?

21:47.106 --> 21:49.576
Uh, I've had
a better couple days, Ray.

21:49.576 --> 21:51.043
Yeah.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.779
I got a proposition for you.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.246
What's that?

21:54.246 --> 21:55.982
Need you to take
my boat out for a run.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.550
I've got something
I have to do.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.918
And you heard
I was available?

21:58.918 --> 22:00.319
Boat's due out tomorrow.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.457
Yeah, well, I just got in,
and I'm beat.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.792
Tomorrow.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.026
Will you take her or not?

22:07.026 --> 22:09.962
Jesus C--Christ, Ray.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.632
I mean, I just wanna take
a goddamn breath.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.534
I got a crew
I gotta look out for.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.736
Bring 'em.
My crew's bound.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.372
Just like that?

22:19.372 --> 22:21.340
- Just like what?
-  I haven't fished

22:21.340 --> 22:23.142
for you in years,

22:23.142 --> 22:24.944
and you just take the boat out?

22:26.212 --> 22:28.080
Yes or no?

22:28.080 --> 22:29.849
No!

22:29.849 --> 22:32.051
I'd like to help you out,
Ray, but you--

22:32.051 --> 22:34.421
you make it
pretty goddamn tough.

22:43.563 --> 22:44.797
Tommy?

22:54.574 --> 22:55.942
Please?

23:05.618 --> 23:08.555
Yeah, okay, Pop.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.423
Okay.

23:10.423 --> 23:11.758
Well, have fun.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.225
Just don't get too hungover.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.027
Yeah, you buy a keg and tell
me not to get too drunk.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.963
Tomorrow, you gotta be
on the boat at 8:00 a.m...

23:16.963 --> 23:18.865
We're doing gear work all day.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.436
Up on the third floor.

23:23.436 --> 23:26.305
Yeah, Costa and I
used to live there.

23:26.305 --> 23:27.306
What's up, Jamie?

23:28.775 --> 23:31.911
Beer delivery this way.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.145
Charlie!

23:36.115 --> 23:38.117
Boom!

23:42.455 --> 23:44.323
Fuck.

23:44.323 --> 23:45.492
We got tail.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.959
We got linguica.

23:46.959 --> 23:50.196
We got the Virgin Mary
in the bathtub.

23:51.363 --> 23:52.932
Uh-uh, not too much
in the soup.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.267
There's plenty of meat
everywhere else.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.736
All right.

23:56.736 --> 23:59.539
Charlie, meet Anne Marie.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.873
Hey.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.842
- My dry-land sweetheart.
- How you doing?

24:02.842 --> 24:04.110
Hey, Anne, this is Charlie.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.945
Uh, Tom's way, way
.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.346
Good to meet you.

24:07.346 --> 24:08.948
Ah, I heard all
about you, Charlie.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.750
- Really?
- I hope you like to eat.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.519
I do.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.787
Oh, [speaks Portuguese].

24:14.787 --> 24:17.089
.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.157
Welcome to our house.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.391
Thanks for having me.

24:19.391 --> 24:20.827
Go back to work.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.962
- What?
- Go pump the keg.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.232
Yes, sir.

24:29.435 --> 24:32.271
Hey, where'd you get
such a cute brother?

24:32.271 --> 24:33.873
Beats me.

24:33.873 --> 24:36.142
But not an ounce
of pussy in him.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.778
Uh-uh, unlike you two.

24:40.279 --> 24:43.082
Hey, that's not a way
in which a pregnant woman

24:43.082 --> 24:44.450
should be talking.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.619
- Oh.
- Oh.

24:46.619 --> 24:47.954
Ay.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.956
Hey, sweetheart.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.257
Mm, you need a shave.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.625
- Scratchy?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.597
I got us another site.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.267
But how?

25:01.267 --> 25:05.938
Like--like, after yesterday?
What boat?

25:05.938 --> 25:07.907
My old man's.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.879
When?

25:14.847 --> 25:17.316
8:00 tomorrow, on the dock.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.553
- Thank you.
- Hey, good to meet you.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.154
Good to meet you.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.530
Keep it pumping, white boy.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.912
I'll tell you when to stop.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.061
When.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.562
All right.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.598
Charles'll get
in trouble with that.

26:06.733 --> 26:07.934
Charles better hurry,

26:07.934 --> 26:11.470
'cause he's got about 17 hours
to do so.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.442
I'm gonna need a lot of help
from you today, Charlie.

26:16.442 --> 26:17.810
Oh, yeah?

26:17.810 --> 26:19.979
You're gonna have to do
just what I ask you to.

26:20.947 --> 26:23.783
Really?

26:23.783 --> 26:26.018
What about Skeemo?

26:26.018 --> 26:27.586
What about him?

26:27.586 --> 26:29.488
I don't know.
You guys together or something?

26:30.957 --> 26:32.591
Why would you think that?

26:32.591 --> 26:36.462
Well, 'cause you came to see
him the morning we got in.

26:36.462 --> 26:38.665
I know you know that's
not why I came to see him.

26:40.767 --> 26:41.834
I was doing Skeemo a favor.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.202
You can ask him about it.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.238
I'm not no dealer.

26:46.238 --> 26:48.174
And I sure as shit
ain't no one's girlfriend,

26:48.174 --> 26:50.509
you got that?

26:50.509 --> 26:52.011
All right.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.246
All right, I'm sorry I asked.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.015
Well, does
that mean you'll do it?

26:57.850 --> 26:59.118
Do what?

27:01.721 --> 27:03.690
Whatever I ask you to.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.557
I still got it, I think.

27:05.557 --> 27:06.826
You never had it.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.127
No, I think I do.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.262
No.
That was awful on your part.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.463
Mabes?

27:11.463 --> 27:12.932
Mabel?

27:12.932 --> 27:14.300
Give me a ride somewhere.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.703
No, walk.
Three's a crowd.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.404
I can't feel my feet.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.674
Come on.

27:21.674 --> 27:23.009
It's not very far.

27:24.677 --> 27:25.644
Ha-ha.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.493
Get out.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.900
See you tomorrow, Charlie.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.601
Gear work, 8:00 a.m. sharp.

27:49.601 --> 27:52.071
- All right.
- Oh,

27:52.071 --> 27:54.606
Just so you know,

27:54.606 --> 27:57.877
Tom does not like it
if we're late.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.612
Okay, all right. Noted.

28:00.612 --> 28:01.848
Hey, Mabel!

28:01.848 --> 28:03.215
Where are you going?

28:03.215 --> 28:04.583
Somewhere else.

28:04.583 --> 28:05.617
Come on up here.

28:05.617 --> 28:07.086
I got money for ya.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.722
You mean you got
my money for me?

28:09.722 --> 28:12.391
Okay.
You want it, or don't you?

28:15.661 --> 28:18.130
Just wait here.
I'll be a minute.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.767
Hey, what, are you ashamed?

28:20.767 --> 28:22.068
Ashamed of what?

28:24.370 --> 28:25.772
I'm not ashamed of nothing.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.175
Come on.

28:38.785 --> 28:39.786
Hey.

28:39.786 --> 28:40.853
Just like I told you, huh?

28:43.722 --> 28:46.158
Look who it is.
What you drawing?

28:48.995 --> 28:51.864
So who are you?

28:51.864 --> 28:53.499
I'm Charlie.

28:53.499 --> 28:54.566
Oh.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.668
I'm Paulette.
I'm Mabel's mom.

28:56.668 --> 28:58.871
- You're short 20 bucks.
- Yeah, so I owe you.

29:00.672 --> 29:01.740
Where you from?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.843
Uh, I'm from, uh,
South Dartmouth.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.744
Where in South Dartmouth?

29:08.014 --> 29:09.048
Padanaram.

29:10.482 --> 29:11.784
I can't even spell Padanaram.

29:11.784 --> 29:13.685
Yeah, it's spelled
with six zeros.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.187
Rich kid, huh?

29:15.187 --> 29:17.023
So what, you gonna fuck
my daughter and then dump her?

29:17.023 --> 29:18.324
Mom.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.525
Am I wrong?

29:21.193 --> 29:22.761
Am I?

29:22.761 --> 29:26.899
Chucky, Tommy Bahama,
whatever the fuck your name is?

29:26.899 --> 29:28.801
Go.

29:28.801 --> 29:30.937
Hey, drop something off
for me, will ya?

29:30.937 --> 29:31.971
Drop it yourself.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.405
Come on!

29:35.241 --> 29:36.375
Mabel.

29:36.375 --> 29:37.844
Hey, look, your mom's wrong.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.711
That's not what I'm about.

29:39.711 --> 29:40.847
Look, I know we just met,

29:40.847 --> 29:42.214
but I really like you,
all right?

29:42.214 --> 29:44.984
You need to know
some shit about me, Charlie.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.218
All right,
I'm interested in stuff.

29:46.218 --> 29:48.420
I'm interested in myself.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.890
You know, I'm a brave person.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.324
All right, I look after me

29:52.324 --> 29:55.327
'cause I'm the only one
that's doing that.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.562
All right,
and you know what I want?

29:56.562 --> 29:58.497
I wanna give myself a shot.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.199
All right?
I want--I wanna make the most

30:00.199 --> 30:01.934
out of myself and of my life.

30:01.934 --> 30:04.370
And I'm not sure I'm gonna
do it, but I know that I can.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.772
Does that make sense to you?

30:06.772 --> 30:08.674
Yeah, you wanna be
your own hero.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.485
It's just
where I'm from, right.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.853
It's not where I'm going.

30:20.853 --> 30:22.354
Okay.

30:22.354 --> 30:23.822
So let's go.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.964
My car is this way, dummy.

30:40.572 --> 30:43.242
I've been up here
on my own since I was 17.

31:02.962 --> 31:05.231
This is me.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.303
You're beautiful.

31:50.376 --> 31:52.078
Is he still fucking
looking at me?

31:52.078 --> 31:53.445
Yeah.

31:53.445 --> 31:54.846
I can't fucking do this
while he's looking at me.

31:54.846 --> 31:56.115
It's like taking a piss.

31:56.115 --> 31:59.185
I can feel his eyes
fucking burning my neck.

31:59.185 --> 32:00.819
Fucking Eldridge, man.

32:00.819 --> 32:02.554
Dude still scares
the piss out of me.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.823
He scares the piss
out of everybody.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.961
Where the hell is Charlie?

32:08.961 --> 32:12.631
He better fucking get here
before Tom does.

32:12.631 --> 32:16.135
Oh, man.
Here we go.

32:16.135 --> 32:18.404
- Thanks.
- See ya, mate.

32:21.407 --> 32:22.808
Ray, what's up?

32:22.808 --> 32:25.511
Got some twine tops
and rings to drop off.

32:25.511 --> 32:26.545
So drop 'em.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.421
All these years on draggers,

32:35.421 --> 32:37.923
I hope you haven't forgotten
how to scallop.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.092
You all right?

32:40.092 --> 32:41.893
Yeah, finest kind.

32:41.893 --> 32:44.230
I've been working
the channel, killing it.

32:44.230 --> 32:47.366
Big as pie plates.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.068
It's marked down
up in the wheelhouse.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.670
Yeah, well, yeah, I have
some ideas of my own.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.672
Well, my boat, my ideas.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.774
I can stay home.
You can take her out.

32:55.774 --> 32:57.276
I don't wanna tango
with you right now, Tom.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.510
I don't wanna tango
with you, Ray.

32:58.510 --> 32:59.811
You keep an eye on the shoes.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.281
I don't want you
fucking up my dredges.

33:02.281 --> 33:05.051
No more than 12 knots
steaming out.

33:05.051 --> 33:06.885
This ain't a fucking race.

33:17.463 --> 33:18.397
Hey.

33:18.397 --> 33:19.798
Come on, guys.

33:27.573 --> 33:28.974
Where's my fucking brother?

33:44.022 --> 33:46.292
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:46.292 --> 33:47.793
You were asleep,

33:47.793 --> 33:49.661
but the rest of you is awake.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.782
You like me, Charlie?

34:10.782 --> 34:12.118
Yeah.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.488
I like you too.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.167
I like everything about you.

34:29.635 --> 34:32.504
Like me lower.

34:32.504 --> 34:33.805
Yeah.

34:53.859 --> 34:57.596
Who's calling you so early?

34:57.596 --> 35:00.399
It's not so early.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.901
What do you mean?

35:02.901 --> 35:05.637
I keep cardboard
on the windows.

35:05.637 --> 35:07.706
- What?
- I like it dark when I sleep.

35:10.442 --> 35:13.212
What--dude!

35:13.212 --> 35:15.881
Shit!

35:15.881 --> 35:17.115
What time is it?

35:17.115 --> 35:19.485
Oh, uh, it's 8:23.

35:19.485 --> 35:21.119
- No!
- Skeemo.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.454
Skeemo's calling.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.989
Skeemo!
Skeemo, it's Charlie.

35:23.989 --> 35:25.991
We've been looking for you.
You fucked up, man.

35:25.991 --> 35:27.459
We're in the harbor.
We're leaving.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.461
- Whoa!
<i>- Is that Charlie?</i>

35:30.061 --> 35:33.199
Ask college boy what he doesn't
understand about "8:00."

35:33.199 --> 35:35.701
<i>Tell him we'll see him
in ten days.</i>

35:35.701 --> 35:37.703
- Thomas--
- Skeemo.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.070
Hey, Charlie.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.439
This is Costa.
Where are you?

35:40.439 --> 35:41.607
Yo, I'm at Mabel's.

35:41.607 --> 35:42.641
Where's Mabel's?

35:42.641 --> 35:43.775
East Rodney French!

35:43.775 --> 35:45.277
All right,
you still got time.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.778
Mabel, just get him on
to the hurricane deck, okay?

35:46.778 --> 35:48.480
<i>Just leave now.</i>
- All right, we're coming.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.416
Not a fucking chance.

35:50.416 --> 35:51.750
You got your keys?

35:51.750 --> 35:53.118
Yeah, I got them right here.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.789
Go, go!

35:57.789 --> 35:59.358
Right here, right here.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.331
Go, go!

36:09.735 --> 36:11.270
Whoa!

36:11.270 --> 36:12.438
Mabel!

36:12.438 --> 36:13.639
Whoa!

36:15.106 --> 36:16.708
Oh, my God.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.560
Oh, shit!
We're on the sidewalk!

36:36.194 --> 36:38.297
Mabel--whoa!

36:42.401 --> 36:43.369
Shit.

36:46.805 --> 36:49.140
Slow the fuck down!

36:49.140 --> 36:50.842
Oh, my God.

36:50.842 --> 36:54.646
Mabel, fuck, you can drive.

36:57.616 --> 36:59.785
Come on, man.
This is cold.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.753
He's your little brother.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.455
And plus, we need
the extra hands, Tom.

37:03.455 --> 37:04.823
I'm sorry, rules are rules.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.525
Same for everyone.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.975
Look up.
They're on the dyke.

37:25.210 --> 37:26.978
Yeah, I see him.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.017
Oh, man.

37:32.017 --> 37:33.319
That's Mabel's car, right?

37:36.722 --> 37:39.825
There--there was something
I wanted to talk to you about.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.527
I was thinking about going
to community college.

37:41.527 --> 37:43.128
Do you think that's
a crazy idea?

37:43.128 --> 37:45.096
It's great.
Wait, what?

37:45.096 --> 37:46.532
I fucking told you
he was gonna come.

37:46.532 --> 37:47.699
Community college.

37:47.699 --> 37:48.900
Do you think
that's a crazy idea?

37:48.900 --> 37:49.801
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.002
He's gonna make it.

37:51.002 --> 37:52.170
What the fuck are you doing?

37:52.170 --> 37:53.405
Just slow down, Tom.

37:53.405 --> 37:54.406
He's your little brother!

37:54.406 --> 37:56.274
Come on.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.709
- Yes or--yes or no?
- Wait, there they are!

37:57.709 --> 37:59.978
Look!
- Oh!

37:59.978 --> 38:01.813
Oh, he's gonna--
he's going for it, man.

38:01.813 --> 38:04.650
Let's go, Charlie!

38:04.650 --> 38:06.217
- Costa, look.
- Right there, man.

38:06.217 --> 38:07.419
He's going for it.

38:07.419 --> 38:08.887
Oh, no fucking way.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.656
Come on, Charlie!

38:10.656 --> 38:11.757
Come on, baby boy!

38:15.961 --> 38:17.596
- Wait, Charlie!
- Yeah?

38:17.596 --> 38:18.830
You didn't answer
my question.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.165
Community college.
- Community college?

38:20.165 --> 38:21.232
Do you think that's
stupid, or don't you?

38:21.232 --> 38:22.801
It's smart.
You're smart.

38:22.801 --> 38:23.869
It's smart.
You should go.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.236
Go.
- Okay.

38:25.236 --> 38:26.204
Be your own hero.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.342
Good luck!

38:35.647 --> 38:37.383
- Row in!
- Come on, Charlie!

38:39.918 --> 38:40.852
Come on, Charlie!

38:40.852 --> 38:42.320
You can make it!

38:42.320 --> 38:43.689
Not dead yet!

38:43.689 --> 38:47.092
all: Not dead yet!
Not dead yet!

38:47.092 --> 38:51.563
Not dead yet!
Not dead yet!

38:51.563 --> 38:52.731
There he goes!

38:54.199 --> 38:55.333
Oh!

38:57.469 --> 38:58.637
Oh, shit.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.038
Let's go, baby dolphin!

39:00.038 --> 39:01.440
Right here, right here.
Let's get him.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.341
Give me that, yeah.
- Pull the rig out!

39:03.341 --> 39:04.976
Take it!

39:04.976 --> 39:06.244
Grab it, Charlie!

39:11.883 --> 39:13.385
- Yeah!
- Charlie!

39:14.786 --> 39:16.888
Come on, Charlie!

39:16.888 --> 39:18.790
Out of the water!

39:18.790 --> 39:19.991
Let's go, baby!

39:19.991 --> 39:21.560
Get him out of the water!

39:21.560 --> 39:22.828
Come on, baby!

39:22.828 --> 39:24.095
Come on, man!

39:24.095 --> 39:25.764
Come on, baby!
- You got it.

39:25.764 --> 39:26.765
Come up.

39:26.765 --> 39:27.799
Come on.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.635
Oh.

39:29.635 --> 39:30.769
Yeah, boy.

39:37.409 --> 39:38.744
Mabel!

39:38.744 --> 39:40.412
Charlie!

40:22.654 --> 40:24.322
Outward bound.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.360
Godspeed, boys.

40:32.498 --> 40:34.800
Godspeed.

41:23.081 --> 41:26.552
Look, I overslept.
I'm sorry.

41:26.552 --> 41:28.820
Well, if you said
you weren't paying attention,

41:28.820 --> 41:31.189
I'd throw you back
over the side.

41:41.232 --> 41:43.201
Man, the sky and the sea
are the same color.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.036
You can't even see the horizon.

41:46.471 --> 41:48.339
You know
what you also can't see?

41:49.641 --> 41:52.210
Whales down there.

41:52.210 --> 41:53.444
Where?

41:53.444 --> 41:54.980
50 feet below us.

41:54.980 --> 41:56.514
Wanna hear 'em?

41:58.750 --> 41:59.885
Yeah.

42:16.434 --> 42:17.903
Humpbacks.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.174
Where is that coming from?

42:23.174 --> 42:25.777
Ray wired up a microphone.

42:25.777 --> 42:29.380
He's a closet whale hugger.

42:33.084 --> 42:35.854
And he's
from down South, right?

42:35.854 --> 42:37.222
Texas.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.958
How did he end up
in Massachusetts?

42:39.958 --> 42:44.562
He had a shrimp boat
out of Galveston.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.031
Hurricane sunk it.

42:46.031 --> 42:50.368
He came up here to New Bedford.

42:50.368 --> 42:53.538
My mom had me.

42:53.538 --> 42:55.106
Never went home.

43:03.849 --> 43:05.183
You should probably turn in.

43:07.018 --> 43:09.487
All right.
I mean, aye, aye, cap'n.

43:28.539 --> 43:31.142
You gonna fuck that thing
when you're done feeling it up?

43:33.278 --> 43:36.815
You got to stow
these things just right.

43:36.815 --> 43:39.050
You get a little bit
of mildew on the seams,

43:39.050 --> 43:40.218
it weakens, splits.

43:40.218 --> 43:41.286
It's fucking over.

43:41.286 --> 43:42.520
What the hell is that?

43:42.520 --> 43:44.255
It's a survival suit, Charlie.

43:44.255 --> 43:46.624
We go down.
I put this bad boy on.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.960
Coast Guard finds me two days
after Skeemo over here

43:48.960 --> 43:50.528
is sleeping with the fishes.

43:50.528 --> 43:52.530
Biggest waste
of money I ever saw.

43:52.530 --> 43:54.265
Boats do sink,
in case you forgot

43:54.265 --> 43:57.035
what happened last Monday.

43:57.035 --> 43:59.805
Well, it's like this, Nunesy.

43:59.805 --> 44:02.507
Sure, you and I are dory mates.

44:02.507 --> 44:04.375
But this ship starts going down

44:04.375 --> 44:06.044
and you march out on the deck
wearing that thing,

44:06.044 --> 44:07.178
what do you think's
gonna happen?

44:07.178 --> 44:08.313
We're gonna pat you
on the back,

44:08.313 --> 44:10.581
say lucky for you?
No.

44:10.581 --> 44:12.250
I'm gonna smack you over
the head with a marlinspike

44:12.250 --> 44:13.618
and take the fucking thing.

44:13.618 --> 44:15.220
And then I gotta fight Charlie
for it.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.421
And he's a scrappy looking kid.

44:16.421 --> 44:18.523
I'm not looking forward
to that.

44:20.158 --> 44:22.560
You think I didn't think
about that?

44:22.560 --> 44:26.264
No, I don't think you thought
about that, Nunesy.

44:31.502 --> 44:32.570
The fuck?

44:32.570 --> 44:33.705
Jesus Christ.

44:34.840 --> 44:36.975
Yeah, yeah.
I'll let him know.

44:36.975 --> 44:38.476
I got six friends here

44:38.476 --> 44:39.878
that say
I'm gonna wear that bad boy

44:39.878 --> 44:42.480
into the deep blue sea.

44:42.480 --> 44:44.415
You don't have any idea
how fucked up

44:44.415 --> 44:45.851
what you just said is, do you?

44:45.851 --> 44:49.354
Well, you're the one talking
about killing me for it.

44:49.354 --> 44:52.123
I'm joking with you.
You bought a gun.

44:52.123 --> 44:53.358
You put it
in your fucking suit.

44:53.358 --> 44:54.459
Are you out of your mind?

44:54.459 --> 44:56.227
You're a sick man.
- Yeah.

44:56.227 --> 44:57.896
Guys,
it's clarified our roles.

44:57.896 --> 44:59.330
It's given us all a goal.

44:59.330 --> 45:00.631
You know, human resources,

45:00.631 --> 45:02.400
they'd call it
good team building.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.602
- You see?
- Yeah.

45:04.602 --> 45:06.204
Team building.

45:06.204 --> 45:07.806
- Team building.
- Yeah.

45:07.806 --> 45:08.907
Yeah.

45:08.907 --> 45:09.908
Beautifully phrased bullshit.

45:09.908 --> 45:11.509
Team building.

45:36.267 --> 45:38.203
Scalloping now, King Charles.

45:38.203 --> 45:40.138
We hook up.

45:40.138 --> 45:41.940
Keep your fingers clear
at all times,

45:41.940 --> 45:42.908
outside of the hook.

45:42.908 --> 45:44.142
All right.

45:44.142 --> 45:45.276
Back up from it.

45:49.815 --> 45:53.084
Wait till it gets
about halfway.

45:53.084 --> 45:56.187
Walk it back
the way I showed you.

45:56.187 --> 45:57.956
Don't pull on it.
Just walk it back.

45:57.956 --> 45:58.957
All right.

45:58.957 --> 46:02.427
Keep coming.
Keep coming.

46:02.427 --> 46:03.929
Great. Nicely done.

46:03.929 --> 46:06.764
Little Double Dutch swing.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.366
Boom.

46:24.015 --> 46:25.884
Whoa!

46:25.884 --> 46:27.452
Boom.

46:31.022 --> 46:33.791
Whoo!
Yeah.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.160
Come on over.

46:35.160 --> 46:39.164
First thing you do:
pull this guy in.

46:39.164 --> 46:40.231
Pull it out of the bullring.

46:40.231 --> 46:43.268
All right, simple as that.

46:43.268 --> 46:44.769
All right.

46:44.769 --> 46:45.803
Gotta move fast.

46:45.803 --> 46:46.771
Time is money.

46:46.771 --> 46:47.805
Uh-huh.

46:47.805 --> 46:48.840
Dump the dump chain.

46:48.840 --> 46:50.008
Yeah.

46:50.008 --> 46:51.242
Now, back the fuck up.

46:59.517 --> 47:01.652
- Look at that.
- Yeah, I see.

47:01.652 --> 47:02.888
Doubloons.

47:02.888 --> 47:04.622
Yeah, man.

47:05.790 --> 47:08.359
Michelin star dinner
right there.

47:08.359 --> 47:09.861
All right, Charlie boy.

47:09.861 --> 47:11.262
So we wanna get the dredge
on the rail.

47:11.262 --> 47:12.830
So we hook it up
to the lifting chain

47:12.830 --> 47:14.799
right here, okay?

47:14.799 --> 47:16.334
We wanna get
out of this bad boy's way.

47:16.334 --> 47:18.203
Okay.
- Okay.

47:21.739 --> 47:22.707
Whoa!

47:22.707 --> 47:24.275
Whoa, okay.

47:31.950 --> 47:33.151
Hit it on the down roll.

47:33.151 --> 47:34.619
The down roll?

47:47.165 --> 47:49.500
All right, now the fun part.

47:49.500 --> 47:51.236
You good at bending over?

47:51.236 --> 47:52.470
You're gonna get
a lot of practice.

47:52.470 --> 47:54.005
Come on.

47:54.005 --> 47:55.206
Come on, baby.

47:55.206 --> 47:56.707
Let's get in here.

47:56.707 --> 47:57.775
All right!

47:57.775 --> 47:59.077
Let's get mad, boys!

47:59.077 --> 48:01.346
Assholes and elbows, come on!

48:05.650 --> 48:06.817
All right, Charlie.

48:06.817 --> 48:08.186
I'm gonna explain this
one time.

48:08.186 --> 48:09.554
Right side up.
- Yeah.

48:09.554 --> 48:11.289
You wanna get in there
nice and slow.

48:11.289 --> 48:13.558
Turn the knife upward
and scrape the meat.

48:13.558 --> 48:15.193
Yep.
Damn, that opened that.

48:15.193 --> 48:17.328
Have fun.

48:17.328 --> 48:18.529
It should all
just come right off.

48:18.529 --> 48:20.265
- There you go.
- Hey!

48:20.265 --> 48:21.699
- Yeah, baby.
- Yeah!

48:21.699 --> 48:23.034
There you go.
You're a natural.

48:23.034 --> 48:24.035
Man, that was perfect!

48:24.035 --> 48:25.203
You see that?

48:25.203 --> 48:27.105
That's beautiful, yeah.

48:27.105 --> 48:28.539
You got to find that rhythm.

48:28.539 --> 48:30.041
What, you gotta dance
while you--

48:30.041 --> 48:31.442
Find that chakra that--
yeah, you do a shuck dance.

48:31.442 --> 48:32.710
It helps you out.

48:32.710 --> 48:33.979
Man, I can't
even put the knife in

48:33.979 --> 48:35.446
when dancing like this.

48:35.446 --> 48:36.814
I got a lot of natural rhythm
anyway, you know?

48:36.814 --> 48:38.549
You should see him
practicing salsa.

48:38.549 --> 48:40.651
Let's find a big scallop.

48:40.651 --> 48:41.886
Big one's a different story.

48:41.886 --> 48:43.388
You got to flip
your knife around, right?

48:43.388 --> 48:44.855
Hold that.
Flip your knife around.

48:44.855 --> 48:46.391
Right.
You got to hit it hard.

48:46.391 --> 48:47.993
Knock it out.
- He didn't do that.

48:47.993 --> 48:49.627
You got to knock it.
The big ones are conscious.

48:49.627 --> 48:51.029
You got to knock it out.
Hit it harder.

48:51.029 --> 48:53.431
You got to--knock it out!

48:53.431 --> 48:54.899
I'm joking.
You don't got to knock it.

49:00.871 --> 49:02.240
Know what I'm saying?

49:08.079 --> 49:09.480
<i>All right, King Charles.</i>

49:09.480 --> 49:11.216
Now, we wash.

49:11.649 --> 49:13.484
Here's
where you polish them up.

49:13.484 --> 49:15.420
You get them looking
nice and sparkling clean.

49:15.420 --> 49:17.755
Oh, yeah.

49:17.755 --> 49:19.290
Grab one
of those muslin bags

49:19.290 --> 49:21.226
like I showed you.

49:21.226 --> 49:22.293
Hold it open.

49:22.293 --> 49:24.329
There you go.

49:24.329 --> 49:26.864
You got a bag of gold.

49:26.864 --> 49:28.233
Yeah.

49:30.001 --> 49:31.869
You enjoying yourself?

49:31.869 --> 49:33.638
Yes, sir!

49:33.638 --> 49:36.474
Fat baby.

49:36.474 --> 49:38.443
Hey, grab that shovel, Charlie.

49:38.443 --> 49:42.813
I got it.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.349
Just sprinkle
a little bit on top.

49:44.349 --> 49:46.317
Give it a little bit of love.

49:46.317 --> 49:47.585
- Like that?
- Like that.

49:47.585 --> 49:49.487
That's perfect.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.056
That's good.
That's good.

49:53.058 --> 49:54.792
Huh, huh?

49:54.792 --> 49:56.727
Not too bad.

49:57.928 --> 50:00.065
You almost looking
like a fisherman.

50:27.758 --> 50:30.161
What's up, fuckhead?

50:30.161 --> 50:32.263
How we doing?

50:32.263 --> 50:36.067
Six bushels a side, 20-count.

50:36.067 --> 50:39.003
Nice.

50:39.003 --> 50:40.605
Not nice enough.

50:40.605 --> 50:42.440
We're moving north.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.629
Hey, Tom, we're all cut out.

51:04.629 --> 51:07.765
The guys wanna know
when we're setting out again.

51:07.765 --> 51:09.467
See that line of boats?

51:09.467 --> 51:11.969
Those are
American fishing boats.

51:11.969 --> 51:13.471
Uh-huh.

51:13.471 --> 51:15.773
And that is
a Canadian Coast Guard

51:15.773 --> 51:18.209
moving away from us
about 11 miles.

51:18.209 --> 51:21.112
And as soon as they disappear,
we're going in.

51:22.547 --> 51:24.215
Going in where?

51:24.215 --> 51:27.518
Canadian waters.

51:27.518 --> 51:29.387
That's Canada on that side,

51:29.387 --> 51:30.821
and there are scallops
along there.

51:30.821 --> 51:32.557
And I remember a spot
from a few years ago.

51:32.557 --> 51:35.393
It could be virgin stuff, U10s.

51:35.393 --> 51:38.062
U10s means money, baby.

51:38.062 --> 51:40.865
So we shut our transponder off
so we can't be located,

51:40.865 --> 51:44.535
dip in, dip out,
turn it back on,

51:46.237 --> 51:47.838
like nothing happened.

51:47.838 --> 51:51.776
Yeah, we're gonna show Ray
what real fishermen can do.

51:51.776 --> 51:53.578
The biggest trip
the "Finestkind's" had

51:53.578 --> 51:55.613
in five years is gonna be mine.

51:55.613 --> 51:57.315
We're gonna shove
the boat share

51:57.315 --> 51:58.416
so far up his nose,

51:58.416 --> 52:00.084
it's gonna come out his ears.

52:02.587 --> 52:04.121
What happens
if we get caught?

52:06.591 --> 52:08.393
Getting caught
is not an option.

52:08.393 --> 52:10.661
Whew.
Say that again.

52:10.661 --> 52:14.765
Getting caught is
not a fucking option.

55:10.207 --> 55:11.476
Oh, fuck.

55:18.783 --> 55:20.651
Quit, Charlie.
- No, never.

55:20.651 --> 55:22.453
- Charlie.
- Get the fuck off.

55:23.688 --> 55:25.189
Fuck you.
Ah!

55:30.495 --> 55:32.763
Whoo!

56:17.508 --> 56:18.743
There it is, baby.

56:18.743 --> 56:20.911
Whoo!

56:32.289 --> 56:33.791
Fuck.

56:34.492 --> 56:35.726
Fuck.

56:35.726 --> 56:37.528
- Fuck.
- Here, I got you.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.302
What was that?

56:47.605 --> 56:49.039
We're hung up.

56:49.039 --> 56:52.042
But look--no peaks,
no edges, nothing.

56:55.112 --> 56:57.114
Let me try
and work her loose.

56:58.716 --> 57:00.918
Come on.
Come on, baby.

57:16.834 --> 57:17.802
Give it some juice!

57:17.802 --> 57:18.836
Yeah.

57:18.836 --> 57:20.204
Come on, come on.

57:20.204 --> 57:21.806
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

57:33.918 --> 57:35.385
Son of a bitch.

57:35.385 --> 57:36.887
Support dredge is stuck.

57:39.189 --> 57:40.991
Gonna haul back
the starboard side.

57:45.596 --> 57:48.966
Oh, shit.
Canadians coming.

57:50.234 --> 57:52.036
How much time?

57:52.036 --> 57:54.038
Six minutes.

57:54.038 --> 57:55.606
Then we got to cut loose.

57:58.142 --> 57:59.810
Fuck, that's not a boat.

57:59.810 --> 58:02.547
Tom, that's not a boat.

58:08.318 --> 58:11.589
We got killer tomatoes
on the way.

58:11.589 --> 58:13.824
What are killer tomatoes?

58:13.824 --> 58:16.561
Canadian Coast Guard,
'cause they're painted red.

58:36.513 --> 58:38.048
Oh, shit.

58:41.752 --> 58:43.187
Oh!

58:57.702 --> 58:59.704
How close are we to the line?

58:59.704 --> 59:00.738
Not close enough.

59:00.738 --> 59:02.907
We are fucked.

59:04.809 --> 59:05.943
Fuck you!

59:40.645 --> 59:42.980
How soon till we know
if we're in trouble or not?

59:42.980 --> 59:44.514
It depends.

59:44.514 --> 59:48.485
Canadians might be just
happy to chase us off.

59:48.485 --> 59:50.755
Right now, we're just
another boat coming home

59:50.755 --> 59:54.424
'cause we lost a dredge.

59:54.424 --> 59:56.927
Yeah, go tell the boys
to get back on the lines.

59:56.927 --> 59:58.262
All right.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.500
Silver lining is,
lucky you,

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.803
you get a second shot
at Mabel "Black Label"

01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:07.137
earlier than expected.

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:08.605
Yeah, I don't--

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.040
I don't really know
what to do about that.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.676
She's great and everything.

01:00:11.676 --> 01:00:13.043
I just feel like

01:00:13.043 --> 01:00:15.079
with everything
that's been going on with Tom

01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:16.747
and--and I just--

01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:20.084
You're
overthinking it, brother.

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:21.518
Just take it easy.

01:00:23.788 --> 01:00:25.455
Fuck!

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:30.961
Haul this to the state pier.
I'll serve the papers there!

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.663
Your vessel's been seized!

01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:34.164
You know why I fish?

01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:36.767
Because when I'm out at sea,

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:40.738
every asshole in my fucking
life disappears

01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:42.406
from the break on down!

01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:44.942
And you fucking clowns
can suck my--

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:47.544
Fuck you!

01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:54.184
<i>What do you think
about fishing now?</i>

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:58.856
I'd go back out
in a heartbeat.

01:00:58.856 --> 01:01:00.290
Finest kind.

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.693
Get that word
out of your mouth.

01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:04.962
This isn't your life.
It's my life.

01:01:04.962 --> 01:01:06.630
You're just a fucking tourist.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:15.539
No, do--don't get
me wrong, Charlie.

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:17.207
I mean, you're a hell of a kid.

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:19.176
You--
I mean, you could be

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:22.279
in some air-conditioned office
with your father,

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:25.750
but you're out
humping it with us.

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:29.419
You know, always thought
you were a hell of a kid.

01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:34.658
What's gonna happen
to the boat?

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:36.827
We pray to God
they don't take the license.

01:01:39.596 --> 01:01:41.799
Mr. White will probably
fucking end up with her.

01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:50.407
You stay here.

01:01:52.576 --> 01:01:55.345
Hey, Tom?

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.247
Tom, I'm gonna get you
through this.

01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:19.503
Mr. Eldridge isn't home.

01:02:21.939 --> 01:02:24.141
Where is he?

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:26.143
Who are you?

01:02:26.143 --> 01:02:27.677
That tells a story
right there.

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:29.346
I'm his son.

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:30.848
Ray's in Boston.

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:32.883
What's he doing in Boston?

01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:37.021
<i>Call for Dr. Sattler.</i>

01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:39.289
<i>Call for Dr. Lorene Sattler.</i>

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:43.727
Hey, Pop.

01:02:43.727 --> 01:02:45.930
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:48.132
What are you doing here?

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:50.868
How did you know I was here?

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:52.803
Your neighbor.

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:57.441
Yeah.

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.009
Is that you, Charlie?

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:00.044
Mr. Eldridge,
good to see you.

01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:03.513
Yeah, Charlie's been fishing
with us, uh, this summer.

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:06.750
Oh, good.
Brothers ought to be brothers.

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:07.985
How's your mom doing?

01:03:07.985 --> 01:03:09.453
She's good.
Thank you.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:10.855
You're not in the hospital
because you ate

01:03:10.855 --> 01:03:12.289
some of her meatloaf, are you?

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:13.958
She's been making
that a long time, huh?

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:17.127
What's going on?

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.929
Why are you here?

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:24.368
I got cancer.

01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:25.702
In my stomach.

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.440
Same thing that killed my dad,

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.110
and I'm going out
just like he did.

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:34.378
I mean--

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.283
What can we do?

01:03:39.283 --> 01:03:41.051
What--what are they gonna do?
What--what are they doing?

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:43.120
Nothing.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.288
It's too late.

01:03:44.288 --> 01:03:47.457
I waited too long.

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:48.926
I thought it was a ulcer.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:54.198
At least I can stop eating
them goddamn Tums now.

01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:00.237
They were in here
about an hour ago

01:04:00.237 --> 01:04:02.106
wanting to talk about hospices.

01:04:02.106 --> 01:04:03.440
I told them to fuck off.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.841
I'm going fishing.

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:10.214
That boat's my hospice.

01:04:12.482 --> 01:04:13.717
What are you guys doing here?

01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:15.519
You're supposed to be
out to sea.

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.925
Uh, we were fishing the line.

01:04:20.925 --> 01:04:23.327
Uh, dredge got caught up.

01:04:23.327 --> 01:04:26.663
Canadian spotter plane got us.

01:04:26.663 --> 01:04:28.198
Boat's impounded.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:29.799
What in the goddamn hell

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:31.535
are you doing
in Canadian waters?

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:33.938
Where's the boat at now?

01:04:33.938 --> 01:04:36.073
- New Bedford.
- Shit.

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:37.374
I never should
have trusted you.

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:39.343
I do not understand
the way you're built.

01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:40.677
You built me!

01:04:40.677 --> 01:04:42.112
I did not.

01:04:42.112 --> 01:04:44.248
You can't work with people.

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:45.849
You can't get along.

01:04:45.849 --> 01:04:47.151
You have no allegiance.

01:04:47.151 --> 01:04:49.486
You have no commitment
to anybody but yourself.

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:52.356
Mr. Eldridge,
with--with all due respect,

01:04:52.356 --> 01:04:53.958
that's not true.
You're wrong.

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:08.405
It's incredible, shit they
make you wear in this joint.

01:05:11.175 --> 01:05:12.676
You got a knife on you?

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:23.720
Can you boys help me
get out of here?

01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:33.497
Is that my shirt
you're wearing?

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:35.966
Uh, I don't know.

01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:37.434
I found it on the boat.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.436
What's your dad think
about you fishing, Charlie?

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:44.141
Uh, honestly,
Mr. Eldridge, not much.

01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:45.442
Smart man.

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:52.616
It's not your fault, Tom.

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:54.384
I've been chased
off the line many times.

01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:56.020
That could have been me.

01:05:59.189 --> 01:06:02.926
Just plain old dumb, bad luck.

01:06:05.595 --> 01:06:09.266
It seems to be running
in the family here lately.

01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:10.900
I'll get your boat back,
I promise.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.303
No, you're gonna get
your boat back.

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:16.073
- My boat?
- Yeah.

01:06:16.073 --> 01:06:19.709
I die, you get the boat

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:23.380
and all the headaches
that go with it.

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:25.882
I don't want it.

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:30.754
I don't want it.

01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:33.823
Uh, maybe
if we worked it together

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:35.992
or I had gone mate for you,
but, you know,

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.028
I got nothing to do with it.
Give it to your crew.

01:06:38.028 --> 01:06:39.929
I mean, give it
to fucking Charlie.

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:41.698
I--I don't want the boat.

01:06:44.401 --> 01:06:47.271
You want my boat, Charlie?

01:06:47.271 --> 01:06:48.705
No, sir.

01:06:50.707 --> 01:06:51.908
Sorry, Mr. Eldridge.

01:06:51.908 --> 01:06:53.243
I don't wanna get
in the middle of this.

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:55.279
- Mm.
- You guys need to talk.

01:06:55.279 --> 01:06:56.513
No.

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:00.417
Tom won't change.

01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:03.653
I can't change.

01:07:03.653 --> 01:07:06.956
Let that be a lesson
to you, Charlie.

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:09.693
You live.
You die.

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:12.062
It's the in-between
that counts.

01:07:19.103 --> 01:07:21.105
Finest kind.

01:07:37.321 --> 01:07:39.789
So then you knock
the dredge out on the roll,

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:43.560
or else it'll flip,
and then it'll come up empty.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.596
And then we tow them back.

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:49.299
And then you have,
like, 12 minutes

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:52.769
if we're in rocky bottoms,
like, maybe 20 if it's soft.

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:54.271
What do you mean by soft?

01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:56.340
- He means sand.
- Oh.

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.674
Right, so then
we haul them back.

01:07:57.674 --> 01:08:00.344
Wait, h--haul what back?

01:08:00.344 --> 01:08:01.711
The dredges.

01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:04.381
So do you hook up
or run the winch?

01:08:04.381 --> 01:08:05.815
I hook up
because I'm the shacker.

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:08.752
But Skeemo and Nunesy,
they run the winch.

01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:12.656
Well, I might not know
about hooking up or--

01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:15.859
or hauling in, but Shacker,
Nunesy, and Skeemo

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:18.528
sounds like...
A law firm.

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:25.735
So... how long before this
is out of your system?

01:08:25.735 --> 01:08:28.071
- Gary.

01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:30.540
Don't "Gary" me, Donna.
I'm just asking.

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:38.515
I'm thinking of fishing
for a year,

01:08:38.515 --> 01:08:40.284
you know, deferring law school.

01:08:40.284 --> 01:08:43.187
D--don't screw
around, Charlie.

01:08:43.187 --> 01:08:46.089
This is Boston University Law.

01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:48.658
It'll open doors for you
the rest of your life.

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:49.626
I don't want doors
opened for me.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:50.860
I want my own thing.

01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:54.664
You--you want
what you think Tom has,

01:08:54.664 --> 01:08:56.400
but you're gonna find out
he's got shit.

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.435
Stop idolizing him.

01:08:58.435 --> 01:09:00.069
You're better than he is.

01:09:01.605 --> 01:09:03.507
No offense.

01:09:03.507 --> 01:09:05.275
I'm just thinking about it!

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:13.149
He's disappointed.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:17.754
You surprised him.

01:09:17.754 --> 01:09:19.589
Honey, please take this slow.

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:21.191
Mom, there's something else.

01:09:22.659 --> 01:09:24.561
Mr. Eldridge has cancer.

01:09:24.561 --> 01:09:26.396
What?

01:09:26.396 --> 01:09:29.366
Ray?

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:32.869
Me and Tom drove him home
from Mass General.

01:09:32.869 --> 01:09:34.904
Well, Mr. Eldridge told Tom

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:36.740
that he wanted him to have
the boat,

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:39.075
and Tom said no,
and then they just fought.

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:46.650
It's that bad, huh?

01:09:49.253 --> 01:09:51.421
Ray's giving up the boat.

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:53.323
Mom, him and Tom,

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:55.058
they've got to find a way
to figure things out,

01:09:55.058 --> 01:09:57.126
because if--
- Some girl for you

01:09:57.126 --> 01:09:59.329
named, uh, Mabel.

01:10:08.238 --> 01:10:10.274
I didn't think
they named girls Mabel anymore.

01:10:13.009 --> 01:10:14.043
Hey.

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:15.612
I heard you were home,
white boy.

01:10:15.612 --> 01:10:17.947
Yeah.

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:19.583
<i>Who told you, Skeemo?</i>

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:21.685
Uh-huh.

01:10:21.685 --> 01:10:23.553
<i>I'm trying to see you.</i>

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.755
Were you gonna ghost me?

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:27.857
Look, I--I don't even have
your number.

01:10:27.857 --> 01:10:28.892
You could have
called someone.

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:31.628
You have resources.

01:10:31.628 --> 01:10:33.463
Look, I have been thinking
about everything

01:10:33.463 --> 01:10:34.631
<i>that's been going on with--</i>

01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:35.799
Do you got
a girlfriend, Charlie?

01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:41.371
Not right now.

01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:43.940
I mean, not--not steady.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.709
Well, do you want one
or don't you?

01:10:48.545 --> 01:10:50.146
Maybe.

01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:52.582
Well, you better decide,
Mr. Maybe,

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:53.950
because I am parked outside

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:57.053
of your big, expensive
Padanaram mansion.

01:10:57.053 --> 01:10:58.822
<i>You got fucking horses
back there?</i>

01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:05.061
<i>And I need advice filling out
my community college apps.</i>

01:11:14.838 --> 01:11:17.807
We have to write an essay
for the application.

01:11:20.176 --> 01:11:24.147
You should probably write it
about how good you kiss.

01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:26.215
You know I've actually only
ever written an essay once?

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:29.252
- Yeah?
- Yeah, senior year, Moby Dick.

01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:34.257
Um, maybe we should leave
Herman Melville out of this.

01:11:34.257 --> 01:11:36.460
You know, I tried to read it,
but I quit 200 pages in.

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:38.061
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:11:38.061 --> 01:11:40.664
Um...

01:11:40.664 --> 01:11:42.932
I couldn't relate.

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:46.302
My essay was "too many
damn dudes on that boat."

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.504
I hear that.

01:11:51.575 --> 01:11:54.678
So?

01:11:54.678 --> 01:11:55.812
What?

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:57.213
What's gonna be my essay?

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.857
What about
if you make it personal?

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:09.693
You know,
what makes you scared,

01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:11.294
what makes you happy.

01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:18.568
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:20.904
Yeah.

01:12:20.904 --> 01:12:23.306
It was a great crew
while it lasted.

01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:26.142
Hey, we don't know
it's over yet.

01:12:26.142 --> 01:12:28.478
Didn't tell my wife
I'm unemployed yet.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:34.884
Yo, what happened?

01:12:34.884 --> 01:12:37.921
$100,000 fine,
catch forfeited,

01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:40.256
said Ray's lucky to keep
his fucking license.

01:12:40.256 --> 01:12:42.091
Shit.

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:43.427
I thought it was
just supposed to be

01:12:43.427 --> 01:12:46.062
a--a preliminary hearing.

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:47.363
Well, their minds
were made up.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:48.432
Why see me twice?

01:12:48.432 --> 01:12:49.866
Especially in that suit.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.668
I would fine you
a million fuck dollars.

01:12:53.503 --> 01:12:54.538
Easy for you to laugh.

01:12:54.538 --> 01:12:55.672
You got everything.

01:12:55.672 --> 01:12:58.274
Yeah, you're right.

01:12:58.274 --> 01:13:01.144
I got everything,
including you.

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.349
Face only a mother
could love.

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:12.355
Yeah, son of a bitch
said I could send it out

01:13:12.355 --> 01:13:13.690
as my Christmas card.

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:14.891
Yeah.

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:16.125
Ah, shit.

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:18.261
How are we gonna make $100,000?

01:13:19.429 --> 01:13:21.030
Well, Ray's house
is against it,

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.599
so we're fucked at the bank.

01:13:22.599 --> 01:13:24.033
We can't fish it up
because the boat's impounded

01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:25.469
until the fine's paid.

01:13:32.642 --> 01:13:36.480
But goddamn if I'm gonna lose
my father's boat.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:39.215
I--I still don't see
what's in it for me.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:42.118
You lend us the money.

01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:44.187
You--you pay the fine.

01:13:44.187 --> 01:13:47.957
We'll fish exclusively
for Excelsior

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:51.027
until you recoup your 100
plus another 50.

01:13:52.962 --> 01:13:54.698
50% return on my dollar.

01:13:54.698 --> 01:13:56.933
Yeah.

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:59.002
I wish life were that simple.

01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:11.848
I can't let my father die
with his boat tied up.

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:17.120
Name your terms,
and you got a deal.

01:14:23.527 --> 01:14:27.531
The "Finestkind"
is a highliner.

01:14:27.531 --> 01:14:32.235
Ray Eldridge running it
would be a great investment,

01:14:32.235 --> 01:14:34.638
but you...

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:39.843
No.

01:14:39.843 --> 01:14:44.280
And, uh,

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:48.017
the way
you're feelin' right now, Tom?

01:14:48.017 --> 01:14:49.853

Did he?

01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:54.684

01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:02.325

01:16:02.325 --> 01:16:03.593
Come on.

01:16:06.329 --> 01:16:11.434
Rocky, you got a good, cold
white wine hidden back there?

01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:14.838
Chardonnay or a Pinot Grigio?

01:16:14.838 --> 01:16:16.472
- Chardonnay.
- Yeah.

01:16:16.472 --> 01:16:18.007
- In a paper cup.
- In a paper cup.

01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:23.613
Only you could
ever do this to me.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.288
I can handle it.

01:16:32.288 --> 01:16:34.523
That's not what I asked.

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.625
Here you go.

01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:37.827
Thanks, Rock.

01:16:37.827 --> 01:16:39.729
How's Tom handling it?

01:16:39.729 --> 01:16:41.030
Ooh.

01:16:44.868 --> 01:16:47.370
It's not too late.

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.706
You put Tom in this world.

01:16:49.706 --> 01:16:52.441
You can't leave
without saying goodbye.

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:54.577
Me and Tom said goodbye
a long time ago.

01:16:54.577 --> 01:16:57.413

01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:10.126
Couldn't you have played one
of your Merle Haggard songs?

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:13.863
I'm out of quarters, baby.

01:17:20.036 --> 01:17:21.270
Heroin.

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:23.406
Smuggling fucking heroin.

01:17:23.406 --> 01:17:25.675
Are you guys serious
about this?

01:17:25.675 --> 01:17:30.513
You go bad, you might as well
go bad to the bone, baby.

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:35.651
What if we get caught?

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.220
I'll go to Walpole,

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.422
lift some weights,
do some time.

01:17:39.422 --> 01:17:41.825
We'll all get jobs
in the laundry.

01:17:41.825 --> 01:17:44.360
Not gonna get caught.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.263
We're gonna go
ten miles offshore,

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:49.665
pick up a drop,

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:50.967
deliver it back onshore.

01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:52.301
Done.

01:17:52.301 --> 01:17:54.170
Pick up
a hundred-grand delivery fee.

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:55.304
We don't gotta stick
with the cards

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:57.273
that we were dealt, man.

01:17:57.273 --> 01:17:58.674
Fuck the cards.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.477
- Fuck the cards.
- Yeah, fucking fuck the cards.

01:18:01.477 --> 01:18:03.713
We deal ourselves a new hand.

01:18:11.287 --> 01:18:13.489
What do I tell Charlie?

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.059
Ooh, tell Charlie?

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:17.193
Yeah, he's part of the crew.

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:18.527
He's got a right to know.

01:18:20.563 --> 01:18:25.268
Yo, Charlie's the one
who set this up.

01:18:31.908 --> 01:18:33.476
Sorry we're late.

01:18:37.146 --> 01:18:39.082
You found these drug guys?

01:18:39.082 --> 01:18:41.550
You brokered the deal?

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.152
Yeah.

01:18:43.152 --> 01:18:45.154
My mom knows them.

01:18:45.154 --> 01:18:46.522
Yeah, she says it's cool.

01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:49.225
Oh, your girlfriend's
convicted felon,

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:50.794
drug-dealing mother says
it's cool.

01:18:50.794 --> 01:18:54.530
I feel so much better now.

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:55.899
Listen, if you're
not interested,

01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:57.834
they're just gonna find
somebody else who is.

01:18:57.834 --> 01:18:58.902
Was that a threat?

01:18:58.902 --> 01:19:00.369
No.

01:19:00.369 --> 01:19:01.737
I'm just saying
they wanna do business.

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:03.239
So whether that's
with us or whoever,

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:04.740
it really doesn't matter.

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:20.957
How does it work?

01:19:20.957 --> 01:19:22.826
They wanna meet
at Supreme Donuts in an hour.

01:19:28.564 --> 01:19:31.400
There you go.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.236
Marky, I asked for a cruller.

01:19:33.236 --> 01:19:34.670
Does look a cruller to you?

01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:37.340
Ah, here we go.
There they are.

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.707
Yeah, get this out of here.

01:19:45.949 --> 01:19:47.917
What is this, Mabel,
a fucking convention?

01:19:49.252 --> 01:19:50.786
This is Tom.

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:52.255
He's the captain.

01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:55.791
Hi, Tom.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.626
I'm Weeks.

01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:58.928
Pull up a chair.

01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:06.035
Everybody, sit down.

01:20:06.035 --> 01:20:07.236
Relax.

01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:10.173
Would you like some coffee?

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:14.310
Yeah, I'll take
a black, no sugar.

01:20:16.712 --> 01:20:18.381
Counter's over there, motherfucker.

01:20:20.884 --> 01:20:22.919
Hey.

01:20:22.919 --> 01:20:24.854
He's with you guys?

01:20:24.854 --> 01:20:26.089
Yeah.

01:20:26.089 --> 01:20:27.123
He just thinks he's better
than us,

01:20:27.123 --> 01:20:29.558
so he sits by himself.

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:30.826
20 grand.

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:33.262
Another 80 when you
hand over my stock.

01:20:36.866 --> 01:20:38.834
You know, Mabel here says
you guys are one-timing,

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:43.306
but if this works out...

01:20:43.306 --> 01:20:46.109
No, this is it.
One time only.

01:20:46.109 --> 01:20:47.576
Short on cash?

01:20:54.017 --> 01:20:56.219
Mabel here, she has
all the, uh, times,

01:20:56.219 --> 01:20:58.387
addresses, you know,
attitude and longitude--

01:20:58.387 --> 01:20:59.788
all that bullshit.

01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:01.257
We was gonna write it
on her panties,

01:21:01.257 --> 01:21:02.658
but it turns out
she's not wearing any.

01:21:04.427 --> 01:21:07.030
Ha-ha.
There you are.

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:10.366
All right, so you're the one
with his brain in his dick.

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:12.435
You I don't think I like.

01:21:12.435 --> 01:21:16.472
And you, you're a dumbass.

01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:21.677
You, I've seen
those eyes before.

01:21:23.779 --> 01:21:26.950
Those are the eyes that keep
people like me in business.

01:21:28.784 --> 01:21:30.619
And you're
the righteously pissed off one.

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:33.289
You I can deal with,
even if you are fucking mute.

01:21:33.289 --> 01:21:35.024
All right, guys, don't fuck up.

01:21:35.024 --> 01:21:36.892
No second chances.

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.327
Your mom's got my number.

01:21:40.529 --> 01:21:42.999
I expect to see you
promptly after the fact.

01:21:47.203 --> 01:21:50.473
<i>Sure your brother-in-law's
okay with this?</i>

01:21:50.473 --> 01:21:52.708
<i>Yeah, he owes me a favor.</i>

01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:53.977
A big one.

01:21:57.346 --> 01:21:59.648
Let's take her
to the ice house.

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:01.784
What do we need ice for?

01:22:01.784 --> 01:22:03.919
Make a couple of tows,

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:06.322
have some fish in the hole
if the Coast Guard boards us,

01:22:06.322 --> 01:22:09.825
wanna know
why we're out there empty.

01:22:09.825 --> 01:22:13.562
See, that's why you're
the captain, right?

01:22:13.562 --> 01:22:15.764
All right, boys, let's go.

01:22:22.371 --> 01:22:23.839
What?

01:22:23.839 --> 01:22:25.774
Just so you know,
Charlie, this is it.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:28.377
After this,
we go separate ways.

01:22:31.147 --> 01:22:32.681
What are you talking about?

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:33.983
Don't start this shit again.

01:22:33.983 --> 01:22:35.951
You can turn in any time.

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:37.320
No, I'm not turning in.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.787
I'm not going anywhere.
This is my deal.

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.789
It was my idea.
I set the whole thing up.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:43.426
Do you know what line
you're crossing right now?

01:22:43.426 --> 01:22:45.995
What--what line
I'm crossing?

01:22:45.995 --> 01:22:47.530
Did you know what line
you were crossing

01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:50.099
when you went into Canada?

01:22:50.099 --> 01:22:52.268
Huh?
You crossed a line

01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:54.437
to say "fuck you"
to your father, right?

01:22:54.437 --> 01:22:57.840
And I crossed a line
to help you.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.608
Oh!

01:22:59.608 --> 01:23:01.177
Get up
on that fucking bowline.

01:23:21.297 --> 01:23:22.998
That's him.
That's him.

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:57.633
Let's get after it.

01:23:57.633 --> 01:23:59.135
- We leave it.
- We can't do that.

01:23:59.135 --> 01:24:00.603
- We fucking leave it.
- We can't do that.

01:24:00.603 --> 01:24:02.071
We're leaving it there!

01:24:02.071 --> 01:24:03.772
They're gonna think
we ripped them off!

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:05.474
I'm gonna turn it back around.

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:19.788
Fuck.

01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:32.401
You live.
You die.

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:33.769
It's the in-between
that counts.

01:24:33.769 --> 01:24:35.604
Ray Eldridge said so, right?

01:24:35.604 --> 01:24:37.306
Hey, this gets his boat back.

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:38.907
He dies knowing it's okay.

01:24:51.454 --> 01:24:53.122
Yeah.

01:24:56.225 --> 01:24:59.362
Yeah, we got it.

01:24:59.362 --> 01:25:00.763
All right.

01:25:02.698 --> 01:25:03.999
They wanna meet
at the parking lot

01:25:03.999 --> 01:25:06.735
of the Supreme Donuts
in 10 minutes.

01:25:06.735 --> 01:25:09.172
But they only want
two of us there.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.176
Shotgun.

01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:23.219
Tom!

01:25:27.156 --> 01:25:28.657
Tom, I'm coming with.

01:25:35.331 --> 01:25:36.732
Get out.

01:25:36.732 --> 01:25:39.402
What?

01:25:39.402 --> 01:25:40.869
Get out.

01:25:42.305 --> 01:25:43.539
It's the way it's gotta be.

01:25:43.539 --> 01:25:45.040
It's me and Charlie
till the wheels come off.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.275
Get out.

01:26:03.626 --> 01:26:04.993
<i>Get the cashier's check.</i>

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.229
We pay the fine.

01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:08.564
Then how long
before we get the boat?

01:26:08.564 --> 01:26:10.866
We'll be fishing in no time.

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:17.573
What is it?

01:26:17.573 --> 01:26:19.475
What?

01:26:19.475 --> 01:26:20.676
Don't know.

01:26:27.416 --> 01:26:28.851
Shit.
Drugs are mine.

01:26:28.851 --> 01:26:30.386
You don't know about it.
You've never seen 'em.

01:26:30.386 --> 01:26:31.654
Tell me you understand.

01:26:31.654 --> 01:26:32.721
Police!
Hands up!

01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:34.156
Tell me you understand!

01:26:34.156 --> 01:26:35.758
Turn off the car.
Throw the keys out the window.

01:26:35.758 --> 01:26:38.361
- I understand.
- Turn off the car.

01:26:38.361 --> 01:26:40.263
Throw the keys.
Throw!

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:44.667
Get up.

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:48.003
Go, on the ground!

01:26:52.408 --> 01:26:54.142
You dumb bastards.

01:26:58.747 --> 01:27:00.115
You're not fucking cops.

01:27:01.284 --> 01:27:03.819
Protect and serve, motherfucker.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.289
Let's go.
Let's go.

01:27:18.701 --> 01:27:21.337
No!

01:27:21.337 --> 01:27:24.006
- Oh.
- Are you okay?

01:27:24.006 --> 01:27:26.008
Fuck, he's busted
your fucking head open.

01:27:28.811 --> 01:27:30.078
I gotta get you
to the hospital.

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:31.480
- No, uh--
- Hold that.

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.715
No.

01:27:32.715 --> 01:27:34.883
We gotta--we got--

01:27:34.883 --> 01:27:36.785
we gotta go deal
with those Boston guys.

01:27:36.785 --> 01:27:40.456
They're gonna think
we fucking stole from 'em.

01:27:40.456 --> 01:27:43.326
All right.

01:27:50.633 --> 01:27:52.234
No one's here.

01:27:52.234 --> 01:27:54.703
Counter lady said they took off
a few minutes ago.

01:27:55.938 --> 01:27:59.442
Charlie, we're in trouble.

01:27:59.442 --> 01:28:00.943
The hell are we gonna do?

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:06.882
They had badges,
they had lights,

01:28:06.882 --> 01:28:09.017
just like undercover cops.

01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:11.554
We went to the doughnut place
to tell Weeks what happened,

01:28:11.554 --> 01:28:13.556
but we were late.

01:28:13.556 --> 01:28:14.857
Already left.

01:28:16.759 --> 01:28:19.662
What if Weeks
sent those guys?

01:28:19.662 --> 01:28:20.829
And why would he do that?

01:28:20.829 --> 01:28:22.097
So he wouldn't
have to pay us.

01:28:22.097 --> 01:28:24.199
No, he--he wouldn't
take a chance

01:28:24.199 --> 01:28:26.034
with real cops
showing up on us.

01:28:32.608 --> 01:28:34.777
What's going on
over there, Rock?

01:28:34.777 --> 01:28:36.178
Don't know.

01:28:36.178 --> 01:28:37.346
Boys were waiting.

01:28:37.346 --> 01:28:38.414
Tom came in beat up.

01:28:46.889 --> 01:28:48.457
What happened?

01:28:48.457 --> 01:28:50.459
Weeks just called my mom
and said you guys didn't show.

01:28:50.459 --> 01:28:52.227
He's crazy mad.

01:28:52.227 --> 01:28:53.362
We got robbed.

01:28:53.362 --> 01:28:54.630
What?

01:28:54.630 --> 01:28:55.864
Who were they?

01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.635
Who's who?

01:28:59.635 --> 01:29:01.704
The guys who jumped us.

01:29:01.704 --> 01:29:03.138
Are you asking me?

01:29:03.138 --> 01:29:05.140
How would I know?
- Tom, don't.

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:06.274
You set us up.

01:29:06.274 --> 01:29:07.910
Are you fucking
serious right now?

01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:09.311
You fucking set us up.
Look at me.

01:29:09.311 --> 01:29:10.513
- I didn't fucking set you up.
- Hey, whoa, whoa!

01:29:10.513 --> 01:29:12.415
Hey!
What the fuck is your problem?

01:29:12.415 --> 01:29:13.816
- Stop! Stop it!
- The fuck is your problem?

01:29:13.816 --> 01:29:14.817
You fucking set us up!

01:29:14.817 --> 01:29:15.951
Fuck you, I did!

01:29:15.951 --> 01:29:17.486
How can you talk shit
like that?

01:29:17.486 --> 01:29:18.821
Charlie, she set us up!

01:29:18.821 --> 01:29:19.955
You don't fucking know me!

01:29:19.955 --> 01:29:21.123
- You fucking set us up!
- Tom!

01:29:21.123 --> 01:29:22.625
Never say some shit
like that again!

01:29:22.625 --> 01:29:24.192
- Come on, get out.
- Get off.

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.994
Get your fucking hands off me!

01:29:28.997 --> 01:29:31.333
Hey! Hey!
Hey, stop!

01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:32.401
I didn't fucking
set you up, all right?

01:29:32.401 --> 01:29:33.469
Would you stop?

01:29:33.469 --> 01:29:34.403
I didn't set you up!

01:29:34.403 --> 01:29:36.772
Okay!

01:29:36.772 --> 01:29:38.507
- I like you guys.
- Yeah, we like you.

01:29:38.507 --> 01:29:39.942
Yeah, you like me too?

01:29:39.942 --> 01:29:41.577
Why didn't you fucking
like me in there?

01:29:41.577 --> 01:29:42.811
You didn't say shit to Tom!

01:29:42.811 --> 01:29:44.312
You just let him--you--

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:46.181
I just had to stand there
and fucking take it!

01:29:46.181 --> 01:29:47.616
He's my fucking brother.
What do you want from me?

01:29:47.616 --> 01:29:48.751
- Get the--shut the--
- What am I supposed to do?

01:29:48.751 --> 01:29:50.352
Get the fuck out of my way!

01:29:50.352 --> 01:29:53.422
Mabel, I believe you!

01:29:57.259 --> 01:29:58.461
Fuck!

01:30:00.696 --> 01:30:03.866
I'm good.

01:30:07.369 --> 01:30:10.005
That's fucking priceless.

01:30:10.005 --> 01:30:11.874
What the hell's
going on here, boys?

01:30:11.874 --> 01:30:12.975
N--nothing, Ray.

01:30:12.975 --> 01:30:14.643
Just a misunderstanding.

01:30:14.643 --> 01:30:16.912
Misunderstanding?

01:30:16.912 --> 01:30:18.481
You sure about that?

01:30:18.481 --> 01:30:22.851
Your problems are much bigger
than mine, I guarantee it.

01:30:22.851 --> 01:30:25.488
No offense, Ray, but fuck off.

01:30:25.488 --> 01:30:26.622
Who the hell
do you think you are?

01:30:26.622 --> 01:30:27.656
I'm your fucking son!

01:30:27.656 --> 01:30:29.057
I'm your fucking daddy.

01:30:43.706 --> 01:30:45.207
All right, boys.

01:30:45.207 --> 01:30:47.009
I'm gonna cook you some food,

01:30:47.009 --> 01:30:49.612
and we're gonna talk
some shit out.

01:30:49.612 --> 01:30:52.247
We'll figure this out, okay?

01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:57.085
How you doing?

01:30:57.085 --> 01:30:59.087
Yo, my guy, like, let's--

01:30:59.087 --> 01:31:01.189
let's just take this
outside, okay?

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:02.858
Nah.

01:31:02.858 --> 01:31:04.560
Keep going
where you were going.

01:31:16.505 --> 01:31:18.206
Tony, please.

01:31:25.013 --> 01:31:27.082
She's got nothing
to do with this, man.

01:31:27.082 --> 01:31:28.917
Oh, no, I agree.

01:31:28.917 --> 01:31:30.853
Only thing
I would accuse your wife of

01:31:30.853 --> 01:31:33.255
is making
a wonderful cup of coffee.

01:31:35.724 --> 01:31:37.092
Where's Jamie?

01:31:37.092 --> 01:31:38.493
The living room, watching TV.

01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:41.830
The boy likes Big Bird
just like we used to.

01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:43.699
Just get out of my house.

01:31:43.699 --> 01:31:45.333
We'll talk about this outside.

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:46.635
Nah.

01:31:46.635 --> 01:31:48.470
Kitchen table.

01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:51.206
That's where the real
family business gets done.

01:31:51.206 --> 01:31:53.842
Tom.

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:55.911
Come on.
Sit down.

01:32:05.688 --> 01:32:10.058
So which part
of "promptly after the fact"

01:32:10.058 --> 01:32:13.128
did you have trouble
understanding?

01:32:13.128 --> 01:32:15.731
Because you fellas got
something of mine, right?

01:32:15.731 --> 01:32:18.233
Ah--

01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:22.571
Oh, yeah, that's a problem
we've been having.

01:32:22.571 --> 01:32:24.840
How far apart
are the pains now, Marky?

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:25.941
Just breathe.

01:32:25.941 --> 01:32:27.375
About three minutes.

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:30.145
Now, the quicker you fellas
help me with my problem,

01:32:30.145 --> 01:32:31.947
the sooner
you can handle your own.

01:32:31.947 --> 01:32:33.849
Deal's a deal, cap, all right?

01:32:33.849 --> 01:32:36.484
Big fish eats little fish.

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:39.154
Where's my heroin?

01:32:39.154 --> 01:32:42.290
You should ask
your girl, Mabel.

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:44.593
I actually stopped by there
before I came here.

01:32:44.593 --> 01:32:45.594
Ain't that right, Paul?

01:32:45.594 --> 01:32:47.495
Oh, yeah.

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:49.932
See, you girlfriend
said fake cops took it.

01:32:49.932 --> 01:32:51.533
Come on.

01:32:51.533 --> 01:32:52.567
You think we haven't heard
that bullshit before?

01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:54.436
- She set us up.
- No, she didn't.

01:32:54.436 --> 01:32:55.904
- Charlie.
- She didn't fucking set us up!

01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:57.606
The kid's right.

01:32:57.606 --> 01:33:01.744
If you got a snitch, I'd look
a little more internally.

01:33:01.744 --> 01:33:03.478
And Mabel doesn't know squat.

01:33:03.478 --> 01:33:05.347
And trust me,
we asked her hard.

01:33:05.347 --> 01:33:07.716
You fuck.
What'd you do?

01:33:11.019 --> 01:33:12.688
Call me that again.

01:33:12.688 --> 01:33:13.989
Hey, hey!
Come on!

01:33:13.989 --> 01:33:15.658
- Ah!
- Call me fucker again!

01:33:15.658 --> 01:33:17.660
- Ah!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:19.361
Call me a fuck again!

01:33:19.361 --> 01:33:21.563
- Hey, come on!
- Call me a fuck again!

01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:23.966
Come on!

01:33:23.966 --> 01:33:25.634
I got you.
Just breathe.

01:33:25.634 --> 01:33:27.803
Just breathe.
- Not so fucking brave now?

01:33:29.772 --> 01:33:32.808
Is this your brother?

01:33:32.808 --> 01:33:35.110
Yo, Marky, this big fucker
here, is my brother--

01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:37.680
Irish twins, ten months apart.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:41.083
You guys look
more spread out than that.

01:33:41.083 --> 01:33:44.252
Still a pain in the ass,
though, right?

01:33:44.252 --> 01:33:45.688
I don't have your heroin.

01:33:45.688 --> 01:33:47.823
Well, if that's true, cap,
then someone in your crew

01:33:47.823 --> 01:33:48.891
blew up the deal.

01:33:48.891 --> 01:33:50.158
Snitch is on your end.

01:33:50.158 --> 01:33:51.593
I doubt it.

01:33:51.593 --> 01:33:53.395
Paulie there's my cousin.

01:33:53.395 --> 01:33:56.231
See, family will fuck you,
but not like that.

01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:57.833
Truth is,
it doesn't fucking matter.

01:33:57.833 --> 01:34:00.402
It's the price
of doing business, all right?

01:34:00.402 --> 01:34:02.204
Some fish you catch.
Some get away.

01:34:02.204 --> 01:34:03.706
Am I right?
- Ah!

01:34:03.706 --> 01:34:04.673
Just breathe, baby.

01:34:06.041 --> 01:34:07.810
Where I'm from,

01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:10.312
you're only as good
as your hard-earned reputation.

01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:12.147
You can't have 'em
laughing at you.

01:34:13.682 --> 01:34:16.451
So I very much wanna get
my dope back.

01:34:16.451 --> 01:34:18.120
Oh, she's having
the baby right now!

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.121
We're telling the truth!

01:34:19.121 --> 01:34:21.223
Shut the fuck up!

01:34:21.223 --> 01:34:23.025
It doesn't fucking matter!

01:34:23.025 --> 01:34:26.729
The only thing that matters is
this gets resolved tomorrow!

01:34:26.729 --> 01:34:28.496
That's what happens
when you work in the shop!

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:31.666
You get short fucking notice
when people aren't happy!

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:33.501
Charlie, hold her!

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:34.536
Charlie!

01:34:34.536 --> 01:34:35.537
Go!

01:34:40.909 --> 01:34:44.479
Tomorrow morning,
10:00 a.m.,

01:34:44.479 --> 01:34:46.915
you're gonna bring my heroin
to Supreme Donuts.

01:34:46.915 --> 01:34:48.550
Otherwise,
your troubles with me

01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:50.552
are gonna be over
one way or another.

01:34:50.552 --> 01:34:51.720
Am I being clear?

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.255
Clear.

01:34:57.325 --> 01:34:59.094
Are we sure?

01:34:59.094 --> 01:35:02.965
Because I'm not talking about
breaking your legs here, yeah?

01:35:02.965 --> 01:35:04.566
I understand!

01:35:07.035 --> 01:35:09.437
Let me explain one more time.

01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:11.206
Hey, hey, hey!
Come on--

01:35:11.206 --> 01:35:12.607
- Oh, oh--

01:35:12.607 --> 01:35:14.242
Wait, stop!

01:35:15.878 --> 01:35:17.545
Tomorrow.

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:21.784
Let's go.

01:35:21.784 --> 01:35:23.251
It's okay.

01:35:23.251 --> 01:35:24.652
See you soon.

01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:27.422
Nunesy! Nunesy!
Nunesy, 911!

01:35:27.422 --> 01:35:29.691
- Fuck.

01:35:29.691 --> 01:35:30.859
Ah!

01:35:47.776 --> 01:35:49.377
Mabel!

01:35:52.314 --> 01:35:53.581
God, Charlie.

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:54.649
Mabel.

01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:56.218
Charlie, I just--

01:35:56.218 --> 01:35:58.286
I don't want you
to look at me right now.

01:35:58.286 --> 01:36:01.389
It's really ugly.

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:04.326
There's no one else
I wanna look at.

01:36:08.897 --> 01:36:11.266
I'm sorry.

01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:13.001
I'm really sorry, Charlie.

01:36:13.001 --> 01:36:14.436
Sorry.

01:36:39.828 --> 01:36:41.429
Can I help you, sir?

01:36:44.032 --> 01:36:45.567
I need some advice.

01:37:06.788 --> 01:37:07.956
Hey, Charlie.

01:37:07.956 --> 01:37:08.957
Oh, shit.

01:37:12.094 --> 01:37:13.795
Mr. Eldridge.

01:37:13.795 --> 01:37:16.331
What the hell
are you doing with that pistol?

01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:19.601
Where's Tom?
What's going on?

01:37:19.601 --> 01:37:20.903
Look, it's a long story.

01:37:20.903 --> 01:37:22.237
You know Anne Marie Costa?

01:37:22.237 --> 01:37:24.272
Know who she is:
Tony Costa's wife.

01:37:24.272 --> 01:37:26.074
Yeah.

01:37:26.074 --> 01:37:29.611
She had a baby today, and, uh,
Tom drove her to the hospital,

01:37:29.611 --> 01:37:31.013
and I haven't seen him since.

01:37:31.013 --> 01:37:32.014
I was hoping he was here.

01:37:32.014 --> 01:37:33.248
So why the gun?

01:37:36.919 --> 01:37:38.353
It's messed up.

01:37:38.353 --> 01:37:39.955
Costa got shot by a burglar
in their house.

01:37:39.955 --> 01:37:44.459
I'm getting a rash from
all your bullshit, Charlie.

01:37:44.459 --> 01:37:45.928
You wanna hear what I know?

01:37:48.463 --> 01:37:49.998
Yeah, sure.

01:37:49.998 --> 01:37:54.469
You boys go out fishing
on the double down.

01:37:54.469 --> 01:37:57.672
You're back in port
after one day.

01:37:57.672 --> 01:38:02.410
I see Tom beat up, screaming
about being set up.

01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:04.779
Tony Costa catches
a burglar in this house,

01:38:04.779 --> 01:38:07.749
gets shot, and you,
the college boy,

01:38:07.749 --> 01:38:09.952
are running around
with a pistol in your belt.

01:38:09.952 --> 01:38:12.587
Even a half-wit
New Bedford police detective

01:38:12.587 --> 01:38:14.889
could figure this shit out.

01:38:14.889 --> 01:38:16.724
I know.
We're grown-ups, you know.

01:38:16.724 --> 01:38:18.126
We can't run to our dads
when things go wrong.

01:38:18.126 --> 01:38:19.494
I'm not your father, Charlie.

01:38:19.494 --> 01:38:21.196
I'm that son of a bitch,
Ray Eldridge,

01:38:21.196 --> 01:38:22.931
everybody tries
to steer clear of.

01:38:25.467 --> 01:38:26.634
Oh, hell,
I don't even know

01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:29.737
what I'm doing here anyway.

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:33.408
My wife divorced me,
my son won't talk to me,

01:38:33.408 --> 01:38:36.444
and I ought to be dying
down in Texas,

01:38:36.444 --> 01:38:38.846
not up here with a bunch
of goddamn swamp Yankees.

01:38:40.382 --> 01:38:43.218
Shit.

01:38:43.218 --> 01:38:46.221
So why are you here?

01:38:46.221 --> 01:38:47.855
The price
of New England scallops

01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:49.357
is a hell of a lot higher

01:38:49.357 --> 01:38:51.226
than the price
of Gulf Coast shrimp.

01:38:51.226 --> 01:38:52.961
Right.

01:38:56.564 --> 01:38:58.433
And I like
the North Atlantic.

01:39:02.704 --> 01:39:04.239
I heard the whales.

01:39:04.239 --> 01:39:05.940
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:07.909
Whereabouts?

01:39:07.909 --> 01:39:09.611
Wheelhouse
on the "Finestkind."

01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:12.414
Oh,
did you sing along with them?

01:39:12.414 --> 01:39:15.817
- No, I--

01:39:29.631 --> 01:39:33.801
Gotta sing along
with 'em, Charlie.

01:39:33.801 --> 01:39:36.704
Otherwise, you just listening.

01:39:43.578 --> 01:39:45.047
Your father love you, Charlie?

01:39:48.516 --> 01:39:51.153
Yes, sir.

01:39:51.153 --> 01:39:53.121
Well, I love my son too.

01:39:56.724 --> 01:40:00.928
We're in trouble.

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:03.831
Then why don't you tell me
about it?

01:40:05.633 --> 01:40:09.904

Yo, Nunes.

01:41:17.372 --> 01:41:19.441
Wondering if Tom crashed here.

01:41:19.441 --> 01:41:20.708
I waited for him all night
at the marsh,

01:41:20.708 --> 01:41:22.043
but he didn't show.

01:41:22.043 --> 01:41:23.545
You know where he went?

01:41:23.545 --> 01:41:25.280
Yeah, Tom came
ten minutes ago,

01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:26.748
out of his fucking skull.

01:41:26.748 --> 01:41:28.316
He asked to see
my survival suit .38

01:41:28.316 --> 01:41:30.952
and stuck it in my face
like I'm the fucking snitch.

01:41:33.555 --> 01:41:34.822
Did you know where he went?

01:41:36.391 --> 01:41:38.493
He went to go see Skeemo
at his grandmother's.

01:41:39.727 --> 01:41:42.197
You know the address?

01:41:42.197 --> 01:41:44.299
Yo, what's the fucking address?

01:41:44.299 --> 01:41:46.768
85 Duffy Street, man.

01:41:46.768 --> 01:41:49.137
All right.
It's gonna be all right, okay?

01:41:49.137 --> 01:41:50.538
Charlie!

01:41:50.538 --> 01:41:52.240
Tommy's wrong, man.

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:55.076
Skeemo's one of us.

Tommy.

01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:37.485
I didn't hear you come in.

01:42:37.485 --> 01:42:39.354
I got a pizza.

01:42:39.354 --> 01:42:40.888
You want some?

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:44.592
That's, uh--that's
a lot of dope there, Skeemo.

01:42:44.592 --> 01:42:46.328
Where the money come from?

01:42:46.328 --> 01:42:49.130
I hit a scratch card
for, like, 500 bucks.

01:42:49.130 --> 01:42:50.398
Oh, okay.

01:42:50.398 --> 01:42:51.566
Can you believe that shit?

01:42:51.566 --> 01:42:53.801
Huh.

01:42:53.801 --> 01:42:55.069
Lucky day, you know?

01:42:55.069 --> 01:42:58.506
I went in there.
I wasn't even gonna buy one.

01:42:58.506 --> 01:43:01.543
Bought some cigarettes.
I had five bucks left over.

01:43:08.683 --> 01:43:12.487
Swallow it.

01:43:12.487 --> 01:43:14.389
Swallow it, you snitch.

01:43:17.792 --> 01:43:19.594
Swallow it.

01:43:19.594 --> 01:43:23.097
Fuck.

01:43:23.097 --> 01:43:25.333
What the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

01:43:25.333 --> 01:43:26.468
Jesus.
- Tell me what's up.

01:43:26.468 --> 01:43:27.702
Fuck.

01:43:27.702 --> 01:43:28.636
I don't know
what you think I did.

01:43:28.636 --> 01:43:29.637
Tell me what you--

01:43:29.637 --> 01:43:30.938
Jesus Christ, Tom.

01:43:30.938 --> 01:43:32.674
Charlie, your brother's
gone fucking crazy.

01:43:32.674 --> 01:43:34.208
- Put the gun down!
- Christ, Tom!

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:35.843
Get out of here, Charlie.
Go home, Charlie!

01:43:35.843 --> 01:43:37.178
Tom, listen to me!

01:43:37.178 --> 01:43:38.613
I don't know
what the fuck he's--

01:43:38.613 --> 01:43:42.083
oh--fuck!

01:43:44.319 --> 01:43:46.288
I needed a fix, all right?

01:43:46.288 --> 01:43:49.056
I needed a fucking fix
to know I could when I had to!

01:43:50.592 --> 01:43:51.693
Can't trust a junkie, right?

01:43:51.693 --> 01:43:54.228
Don't you know?

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:56.964
Well, I can't trust
the junkie inside me.

01:43:56.964 --> 01:44:01.135
Ray dies thinking his boat
is lost because of you.

01:44:01.135 --> 01:44:02.203
No.

01:44:04.472 --> 01:44:06.374
That's your fault, not mine.

01:44:06.374 --> 01:44:08.576
You're the captain.
You crossed the line, not me.

01:44:08.576 --> 01:44:09.611
That's on you.

01:44:09.611 --> 01:44:11.012
Shut the fuck up!

01:44:13.748 --> 01:44:16.050
Tom, you're my brother.
Look at me.

01:44:16.050 --> 01:44:19.321
Look at me.

01:44:19.321 --> 01:44:21.523
You live and you die.

01:44:21.523 --> 01:44:23.625
It's the in-between part
that's important.

01:44:24.959 --> 01:44:26.794
This is the in-between part.

01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:34.035
Please.

01:44:45.012 --> 01:44:46.481
I feel
like I'm losing something.

01:44:46.481 --> 01:44:48.149
I don't know how
to get it back.

01:44:54.756 --> 01:44:56.358
Yeah, I know exa--

01:44:56.358 --> 01:44:58.860
I found it.

01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:01.763
Good for you.

01:45:01.763 --> 01:45:05.066
Yeah, right here.

01:45:05.066 --> 01:45:10.772
I found you.

01:45:10.772 --> 01:45:15.410
I got you, you fucking nutcase.

01:45:19.714 --> 01:45:22.384
Come on.

01:45:22.384 --> 01:45:24.352
Gotta make a deal.

01:45:49.711 --> 01:45:51.278
Now that right there, Marky,

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:53.981
that's a goddamn righteous
cruller right there.

01:45:53.981 --> 01:45:55.717
I appreciate that with you.

01:45:55.717 --> 01:45:59.787
Always, you always listen
to what I say

01:45:59.787 --> 01:46:01.623
or why I feel a thing.

01:46:01.623 --> 01:46:04.225
Let me guess:
will work for food?

01:46:05.993 --> 01:46:11.365
I'm Ray Eldridge,
Tom Eldridge's father.

01:46:11.365 --> 01:46:13.067
So what?

01:46:13.067 --> 01:46:14.869
I want you
to leave my son alone.

01:46:17.405 --> 01:46:20.307
You believe
this fucking guy?

01:46:21.909 --> 01:46:23.110
What, you hold his hand

01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:25.312
when you walk him
across the street?

01:46:25.312 --> 01:46:27.949
Wipe his runny nose?

01:46:27.949 --> 01:46:29.383
Ah, I got it.

01:46:29.383 --> 01:46:31.886
When it snows out, you clip
his mittens to his jacket

01:46:31.886 --> 01:46:35.389
so doesn't lose one.

01:46:35.389 --> 01:46:38.726
This motherfucker
coming in here.

01:46:38.726 --> 01:46:41.463
I want you to call it a day.

01:46:41.463 --> 01:46:43.030
I can't do that.

01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:45.166
Your kid owes me big time
on something.

01:46:45.166 --> 01:46:49.971
I got $15,000 in this sack.

01:46:49.971 --> 01:46:52.974
I'll give it to ya.

01:46:52.974 --> 01:46:56.511
I appreciate that.
I do.

01:46:56.511 --> 01:47:00.682
But you'd need, I don't know,
another 300 sacks.

01:47:00.682 --> 01:47:03.885
Does that help you understand
the scope of this issue?

01:47:03.885 --> 01:47:08.222
Please, leave Tom alone.

01:47:09.657 --> 01:47:11.759
I wish I could, all right?

01:47:11.759 --> 01:47:13.227
I got boys of my own.

01:47:13.227 --> 01:47:16.531
I'd hate to see 'em
jammed up like this.

01:47:16.531 --> 01:47:18.566
But maybe, you know,
you should have raised your son

01:47:18.566 --> 01:47:21.235
not to go into business
with guys like me,

01:47:21.235 --> 01:47:23.571
you know, maybe doubled up
on the belt,

01:47:23.571 --> 01:47:25.306
been a better role model.

01:47:25.306 --> 01:47:26.941
Coulda, shoulda, woulda.
But I'll tell you what.

01:47:26.941 --> 01:47:28.576
I'm gonna do you
a favor, all right?

01:47:28.576 --> 01:47:31.012
Give you a head start.

01:47:31.012 --> 01:47:32.547
Why don't you go down here
to this funeral home,

01:47:32.547 --> 01:47:34.215
and I want you to go
in there and pick out

01:47:34.215 --> 01:47:35.983
a fucking pine box
for your kid,

01:47:35.983 --> 01:47:37.151
because he's gonna fucking
need one.

01:47:37.151 --> 01:47:38.886
Now, get the fuck out here!

01:47:46.794 --> 01:47:48.963
This motherfucker
coming in here.

01:47:52.066 --> 01:47:53.234
No, oh, sh--

01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:12.086
There's a man outside
waiting on us.

01:48:14.756 --> 01:48:16.057
He's pretty rough.

01:48:16.057 --> 01:48:20.261
Go fuck yourself.

01:49:26.728 --> 01:49:29.296
You hear the price
of scallops this morning?

01:49:31.733 --> 01:49:34.535
$25.

01:49:34.535 --> 01:49:38.606
Sandra Jane brought in
18,000 pounds.

01:49:55.256 --> 01:49:57.191
What'd you do, Pop?

01:50:01.562 --> 01:50:07.468
Someday, if you ever have
a son,

01:50:07.468 --> 01:50:10.437
the first time you look at him,

01:50:10.437 --> 01:50:15.176
you get a feeling all at once

01:50:15.176 --> 01:50:20.514
that you'd die for him.

01:50:20.514 --> 01:50:23.117
Little thing
you never saw before,

01:50:23.117 --> 01:50:27.054
and you would
stone cold die for him.

01:50:29.256 --> 01:50:32.093
That feeling doesn't go away.

01:50:32.093 --> 01:50:35.963
You might forget.

01:50:35.963 --> 01:50:38.365
But it's always there.

01:50:42.036 --> 01:50:44.038
Always there.

01:51:00.822 --> 01:51:05.559
I--I love you, Pop.

01:51:05.559 --> 01:51:07.695
I do.

01:51:12.233 --> 01:51:15.636
I've tried real hard
to not ever need anyone.

01:51:18.906 --> 01:51:21.108
Don't you do that.

01:51:28.049 --> 01:51:29.516
Don't let him do that, Charlie.

01:51:33.955 --> 01:51:35.489
No, sir.

01:52:05.686 --> 01:52:08.990
Hey.

01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:11.058
You all right?

01:52:11.058 --> 01:52:12.126
You think
they're gonna give me

01:52:12.126 --> 01:52:13.761
a hard time in there?

01:52:19.233 --> 01:52:21.335
Mabel, come on.
You're safe with me.

01:52:24.538 --> 01:52:26.540
I like trusting you, Charlie.

01:52:31.412 --> 01:52:33.815
How do I look, white boy?

01:52:33.815 --> 01:52:36.417
How do you look?

01:52:36.417 --> 01:52:38.185
Fucking incredible.

01:52:49.831 --> 01:52:50.832
Mm-hmm.

01:52:50.832 --> 01:52:53.000
Almost ready.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.668
My famous meatloaf.

01:52:59.573 --> 01:53:01.675
So where did you go to school?

01:53:01.675 --> 01:53:02.910
New Bedford High?

01:53:06.981 --> 01:53:07.982
Yeah.

01:53:07.982 --> 01:53:10.885
Blue House, Tan House?

01:53:10.885 --> 01:53:12.786
I was actually in Gold House.

01:53:12.786 --> 01:53:14.856
Me too.

01:53:14.856 --> 01:53:16.924
You can take the girl
out of New Bedford,

01:53:16.924 --> 01:53:20.294
but you can't take
New Bedford out of the girl.

01:53:20.294 --> 01:53:21.929
And you shouldn't want to.

01:53:25.266 --> 01:53:28.069
I keep her right here.

01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:30.504
So what'd you wanna ask me?

01:53:30.504 --> 01:53:34.375
Oh, uh, I wanted
to borrow some money.

01:53:34.375 --> 01:53:36.911
Sure.

01:53:36.911 --> 01:53:39.213
How much?

01:53:39.213 --> 01:53:41.182
$100,000.

01:53:45.786 --> 01:53:49.790
To pay the fine
on Ray Eldridge's boat.

01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:52.126
Right.

01:53:52.126 --> 01:53:53.260
Jesus Christ.

01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:54.795
After everything
that's happened,

01:53:54.795 --> 01:53:56.830
everything that's gone
so horribly wrong,

01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:58.699
you still wanna fish?

01:53:58.699 --> 01:54:00.834
Yeah.

01:54:00.834 --> 01:54:02.136
I do.

01:54:02.136 --> 01:54:03.704
Just because
I'm a goddamn lawyer

01:54:03.704 --> 01:54:05.039
doesn't mean you should be.
- Don't get mad, Dad.

01:54:05.039 --> 01:54:07.141
What do you want me to do?

01:54:07.141 --> 01:54:08.375
I want you to listen to me!

01:54:08.375 --> 01:54:09.877
- O--okay, Charlie.
- All right?

01:54:09.877 --> 01:54:11.312
But you haven't said
anything that makes sense

01:54:11.312 --> 01:54:13.680
to me in a long time.

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:17.218
Look, I have done hard work
when I was young,

01:54:17.218 --> 01:54:18.685
and it's fulfilling.

01:54:18.685 --> 01:54:19.520
It is.

01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:21.555
But this is so dangerous.

01:54:21.555 --> 01:54:23.824
Yeah, exactly.
That's what I love about it.

01:54:23.824 --> 01:54:26.260
You gotta fight out there.
You gotta be brave.

01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:29.796
You gotta be smart.
You gotta be strong.

01:54:29.796 --> 01:54:31.432
I feel alive
when I'm out there.

01:54:31.432 --> 01:54:32.666
I feel connected.

01:54:32.666 --> 01:54:34.268
I feel like I'm making
my own choices.

01:54:34.268 --> 01:54:36.670
I feel like I'm getting closer
to who I am!

01:54:36.670 --> 01:54:39.440
But Charlie, law school
is gonna give you

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:43.377
so many options.
- Dad, listen to me!

01:54:43.377 --> 01:54:45.312
I'm not going to law school.

01:54:52.753 --> 01:54:55.957
So...

01:54:55.957 --> 01:54:59.293
If you stuck with this,

01:54:59.293 --> 01:55:00.827
how long before you'd be
a captain?

01:55:00.827 --> 01:55:02.763
I'm not sure
I wanna be captain.

01:55:02.763 --> 01:55:03.931
Why not?

01:55:03.931 --> 01:55:06.833
Tom's captain.

01:55:06.833 --> 01:55:09.703
I couldn't be with him
if I was one too.

01:55:09.703 --> 01:55:11.638
And Tom needs me.

01:55:11.638 --> 01:55:14.775
He needs me.
I need him.

01:55:14.775 --> 01:55:16.944
Dad, I have to be
with my brother.

01:55:20.714 --> 01:55:22.383
I have to.

01:55:22.383 --> 01:55:25.819
Do you understand?

01:55:25.819 --> 01:55:28.122
I do.

01:55:28.122 --> 01:55:31.692
Fuck.

01:55:31.692 --> 01:55:33.027
But I--I do.

01:55:36.497 --> 01:55:38.532
Tell Tom to come
see me tomorrow.

01:55:40.034 --> 01:55:41.568
I'll help out
with the legal work,

01:55:41.568 --> 01:55:46.540
and, uh, I'll pay
the fine on the boat.

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:48.242
Th--this is not a gift.

01:55:48.242 --> 01:55:49.476
Okay.

01:55:49.476 --> 01:55:50.944
- It's not a gift.
- Okay, all right.

01:55:50.944 --> 01:55:52.679
Not a gift, yeah.

01:55:52.679 --> 01:55:53.947
Of course.
We will pay it back.

01:55:53.947 --> 01:55:56.317
Well, I'm not sure
it's a loan either.

01:55:56.317 --> 01:55:58.452
What do you mean?

01:55:58.452 --> 01:56:01.622
I think I might want in
on this,

01:56:01.622 --> 01:56:03.324
be your business partner.

01:56:04.691 --> 01:56:06.827
I--I'm out of my fucking mind.

01:56:12.633 --> 01:56:14.501
It's great, ain't it?

01:56:19.073 --> 01:56:24.811
Wherever
you're going with this,

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:26.913
I want you to take me
with you, Charlie.

01:56:34.021 --> 01:56:35.589
All right.

01:56:40.027 --> 01:56:42.529
You're crazy.
- Oh, not as crazy as you.

01:56:43.930 --> 01:56:45.499
I love you, Dad.

01:57:01.082 --> 01:57:03.117
There he is.

01:57:05.519 --> 01:57:07.321
Here.

01:57:07.321 --> 01:57:08.822
I'll take care of you.

01:57:11.658 --> 01:57:13.794
Is "Finestkind"
ready to rumble?

01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:38.585
Hope nobody's in a hurry.

01:58:45.486 --> 01:58:49.323
Yeah!

01:58:49.323 --> 01:58:51.892
Not dead yet, Mr. Eldridge!

01:58:51.892 --> 01:58:53.160
Whoo!

01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:54.528
Crazy fishermen.

01:58:54.528 --> 01:58:57.431
Oh.

01:58:57.431 --> 01:58:59.466
Not dead yet!

01:59:04.271 --> 01:59:06.907
Whoo!

01:59:13.547 --> 01:59:17.218
- Whoo!
- Not dead yet, Mr. Eldridge!

01:59:32.299 --> 01:59:35.001
Outward goddamn bound!

01:59:37.871 --> 01:59:39.940
Outward goddamn bound.

01:59:46.613 --> 01:59:49.250
Mabel!

01:59:49.250 --> 01:59:50.617
Charlie!

01:59:52.553 --> 01:59:54.187
Whoo!

01:59:54.187 --> 01:59:55.456
Charlie!

02:00:16.543 --> 02:00:19.145
Finest kind, baby!
