Carrie:
I GOT THE FLOWERS!

01:18.997 --> 01:19.789
DID YOU
LEAVE ANY?

01:19.956 --> 01:21.458
A WHOLE BUSHEL!

01:23.001 --> 01:24.544
HEY, MA, CAN YOU
COME OUT HERE
A SECOND?

01:24.711 --> 01:25.879
Caroline:
IS IT YOUR PA?

01:26.045 --> 01:28.256
OH, NOT YET,
BUT I WANT YOU
TO SEE SOMETHING.

01:30.675 --> 01:32.093
OH, ISN'T IT
PRETTY?

01:35.054 --> 01:37.015
I WONDERED WHAT
YOU WERE UP TO.
I HAD NO IDEA.

01:37.182 --> 01:38.433
WELL, YOU WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.268
IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A SURPRISE
FOR YOU AND PA,

01:40.435 --> 01:42.896
BUT IT'S GETTING SO LATE
I THOUGHT I'D BETTER
PUT IT UP NOW.

01:43.062 --> 01:44.022
WELL, I GUESS
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO

01:44.189 --> 01:46.941
TAKE OUR SURPRISES
ONE AT A TIME.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.443
I WISH HE'D COME,
THOUGH.

01:48.610 --> 01:50.153

02:02.916 --> 02:03.958
DARN IT, CARRIE!

02:04.125 --> 02:05.084
IT FELL OVER.

02:05.251 --> 02:06.252
WELL,
I CAN SEE THAT,

02:06.419 --> 02:07.712
AND AFTER
ALL THE TROUBLE
I WENT TO

02:07.879 --> 02:10.089
TO MAKE THE TABLE
LOOK NICE
FOR MA AND PA.

02:10.256 --> 02:11.758
NO HARM DONE.

02:11.925 --> 02:14.677
THANK YOU
FOR THE FLOWERS, CARRIE.

02:14.844 --> 02:18.431
LAURA, YOUR TABLE
LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

02:18.598 --> 02:19.599
MA, I'M HUNGRY.

02:19.766 --> 02:20.558
I KNOW, DEAR.

02:20.725 --> 02:22.018
- ME, TOO.

02:23.812 --> 02:27.065
WELL, EVERYTHING'S
JUST ABOUT READY.

02:27.232 --> 02:28.858
AND EVERYONE'S
HERE...

02:29.025 --> 02:30.109
EXCEPT THE GROOM.

02:30.276 --> 02:32.904

HE SHOULD BE ALONG
ANY MOMENT NOW.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.302
[HORSES NEIGHING]

02:57.804 --> 02:59.514
COME ON, DAVID! PULL.

03:22.829 --> 03:24.789
MA.

03:24.956 --> 03:26.833
DO YOU THINK
ANYTHING HAPPENED TO PA?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.793
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.254
HE'S PROBABLY
JUST...DELAYED A BIT

03:31.421 --> 03:33.172
WITH SOME BUSINESS.

03:33.339 --> 03:34.382
I WAS HUNGRY.

03:34.549 --> 03:37.051
HA HA! SOMEHOW
I GUESSED THAT,
CARRIE.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.845
I'M GLAD
WE DIDN'T WAIT.

03:39.012 --> 03:39.846
WELL, IT'S NOT
THE FIRST TIME

03:40.013 --> 03:42.140
I'VE WAITED
FOR YOUR PA.

03:42.307 --> 03:43.725
I'M SURE
IT WON'T BE
THE LAST.

03:43.892 --> 03:46.269
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME
HE KEPT YOU WAITING?

03:46.436 --> 03:48.062
IT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.648
I WAS NO OLDER
THAN YOU, LAURA.

03:50.815 --> 03:52.233
Laura: DID HE HAVE
A GOOD EXCUSE?

03:52.400 --> 03:55.028
HA! A WHIPPING GOOD
EXCUSE, YOU MIGHT SAY.

03:55.194 --> 03:56.154
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

03:56.321 --> 03:58.156
DID YOU FALL IN LOVE
AT FIRST SIGHT?

03:58.323 --> 03:59.866
WELL...

04:00.033 --> 04:02.368
YES...AND NO.

04:02.535 --> 04:05.371
WELL, WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

04:05.538 --> 04:09.000
WELL, FROM THE WAY
YOUR PA ACTED,
I COULDN'T TELL.

04:09.167 --> 04:11.586
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

04:11.753 --> 04:13.212
WE WERE LIVING
ON THE FARM

04:13.379 --> 04:16.674
ON THE BANKS
OF THE OCONOMOWOC RIVER.

04:16.841 --> 04:18.968
OH, MY.

04:19.135 --> 04:21.930
I CAN SEE IT
SO CLEARLY.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.515
WELL, ONE DAY, A WAGON
CAME UP THE ROAD,

04:24.682 --> 04:26.643
AND SOMEBODY
HAILED US.

04:26.809 --> 04:29.520
WE RAN OUTSIDE
TO SEE WHO IT WAS.

04:39.948 --> 04:41.407
HOW DO, YOUNG LADY?

07:08.096 --> 07:09.263
ANY CHANCE TO DO
ANY BAKING,

07:09.430 --> 07:11.099
SO I MADE A LITTLE EXTRA

SHE LIKES YOU.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.593
YOU HURT HER FEELINGS,

09:55.388 --> 09:56.180
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

09:56.347 --> 09:57.390
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

09:57.556 --> 10:00.726
BECAUSE
BOYS HIS AGE--
A LOT OLDER, TOO--

10:00.893 --> 10:02.061
SOMETIMES
ACT LIKE THAT--

10:02.228 --> 10:04.230
YOU KNOW,
SORT OF SILLY
AND STANDOFFISH--

10:04.397 --> 10:05.982
WHEN THEY REALLY
LIKE A GIRL.

10:09.819 --> 10:13.322
Caroline: I COULDN'T
QUITE MAKE OUT
YOUR PA AT FIRST,

10:13.489 --> 10:15.449
BUT MY MA SAID
HE LIKED ME.

FOR NIGHTGOWNS.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.876
NO ARGUMENTS.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.295

10:31.716 --> 10:32.967
[QUIETLY]
OFF TO BED, HONEY.

11:22.141 --> 11:23.100
GOOD NIGHT, MA.

11:23.267 --> 11:24.894
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.

11:25.061 --> 11:26.520
LOOKS LIKE IT'S
GOING TO RAIN.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.564
I SURE HOPE
YOUR PA ISN'T
CAUGHT OUT IN IT.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.941
MA, TELL US SOME MORE
ABOUT YOU AND PA.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.068
WHAT'S MORE TO TELL?

11:32.234 --> 11:33.402
WELL, YOU STILL
HAVEN'T TOLD US

11:33.569 --> 11:36.530
ABOUT HOW HE KEPT YOU
WAITING THE FIRST TIME.

11:36.697 --> 11:37.907
MAYBE I'D JUST
AS SOON FORGET.

11:38.074 --> 11:39.450
COME ON NOW!
OFF TO BED.

11:39.617 --> 11:40.868
PLEASE, MA?

11:42.453 --> 11:44.205
WELL...

11:44.372 --> 11:47.124
IF YOU MUST KNOW...

11:47.291 --> 11:49.335
Mary: WAS IT AWFUL
WAITING FOR HIM?

11:49.502 --> 11:51.337
OH, I GOT OVER IT.

11:51.504 --> 11:54.048
BEAUS ARE
AN UNPREDICTABLE LOT
AT THAT AGE.

11:54.215 --> 11:55.925
WAS HE
YOUR FIRST BEAU?

11:56.092 --> 11:58.844
I SUPPOSE
YOU COULD SAY HE WAS.

11:59.011 --> 12:02.223
THERE WAS ANOTHER BOY--
HAROLD WATSON.

12:02.390 --> 12:05.518
TO THINK I CAN STILL
REMEMBER HIS NAME.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.895
HE SEEMED TO THINK
HE WAS MY BEAU,

12:08.062 --> 12:09.522
BUT I DIDN'T EVEN
LIKE HIM.

12:09.688 --> 12:10.439
WHY NOT?

12:10.606 --> 12:13.192
OH, HE WAS SO...

12:13.359 --> 12:14.777
SELF-IMPORTANT.

12:14.944 --> 12:17.321
HIS FATHER WAS
THE SCHOOLTEACHER,

12:17.488 --> 12:19.949
AND MR. WATSON SEEMED
TO HAVE IT IN FOR CHARLES

12:20.116 --> 12:22.451
FROM THE FIRST DAY
HE SHOWED UP AT SCHOOL.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.578
NOW, FOR THE BENEFIT

12:24.745 --> 12:27.957
OF THOSE WHO ARE
NEW AMONGST US,

12:28.124 --> 12:30.709
I'D LIKE TO
STRESS THE FACT
THAT IN THIS SCHOOL,

12:30.876 --> 12:32.211
WE WORK HARD,

12:32.378 --> 12:34.880
HARD, HARD!

12:35.047 --> 12:37.383
AND THAT WE REGARD
EVERY SUBJECT,

12:37.550 --> 12:40.428
INCLUDING
DEPORTMENT,

12:40.594 --> 12:43.806
OF EQUAL SIGNIFICANCE.

12:43.973 --> 12:44.723
DO I MAKE MYSELF

12:44.890 --> 12:47.476

29:14.629 --> 29:16.714
I KEEP THINKING
ABOUT THAT MR. WATSON

29:16.881 --> 29:19.426
AND THE BERRY FESTIVAL.

29:19.592 --> 29:20.760
I SURE AM GLAD
WE DON'T HAVE

29:20.927 --> 29:22.720
A MEAN TEACHER
LIKE THAT.

29:22.887 --> 29:25.890

HE DIDN'T LAST LONG.

29:26.057 --> 29:29.060

29:40.738 --> 29:44.075
YOUR PA TIED MR. WATSON UP
IN THE OUTHOUSE,

29:44.242 --> 29:47.328
BUT I WASN'T ABOUT TO LET
CHARLES KNOW THAT--

29:47.495 --> 29:48.872
NOT JUST YET.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.982
I'M SORRY I MISSED

30:16.149 --> 30:17.609
IT'S OF
NO CONCERN TO ME.

30:19.777 --> 30:21.279

31:56.207 --> 31:57.041
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WEAR THEM

31:57.208 --> 31:58.501

HEY, WHOA!
HOLD IT. HOLD IT.

45:03.410 --> 45:04.828
WHOA! HEY, COME ON.

45:04.995 --> 45:06.246
YOU'RE GOING TO
GET ALL WET. I'M
SOAKED TO THE SKIN.

45:06.413 --> 45:07.873
I DON'T CARE.
YOU'RE HERE.

45:08.040 --> 45:10.125
OH, I'D HAVE BEEN HERE
A LOT SOONER, TOO.
I LOST A WHEEL,

45:10.292 --> 45:12.461
AND I DIDN'T HAVE
THE WAGON JACK,
SO I HAD TO MAKE DO.

45:12.628 --> 45:14.755
I GOT SO MAD
THERE WAS STEAM
COMING OFF ME.

45:14.922 --> 45:16.006
WHY DON'T YOU
GO INSIDE BEFORE
YOU CATCH A CHILL?

45:16.173 --> 45:17.049
NO, I'M ALL RIGHT.

45:17.216 --> 45:18.175
LISTEN, I GOT
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

45:18.342 --> 45:19.134
OH, YOU REMEMBERED.

45:19.301 --> 45:20.344
OF COURSE I REMEMBER.

45:20.511 --> 45:22.554
HOW WAS I
GOING TO FORGET?
THERE YOU GO.

45:27.351 --> 45:28.227
WELL, WHAT'S
THE MATTER?

45:28.394 --> 45:29.686
ISN'T THAT
THE RIGHT SPICE?

45:29.853 --> 45:31.730
WELL, YOU SAID
A YELLOW CAN WITH
A RED STRIPE--

45:31.897 --> 45:33.232
STUFF YOU COULDN'T
GET AT OLESON'S.

45:36.527 --> 45:39.863
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I ASKED FOR,
CHARLES.

45:42.032 --> 45:43.659
THANK YOU.
I KNEW YOU'D REMEMBER.

45:44.868 --> 45:46.787
WELL, I'LL WAIT
FOR YOU INSIDE.

45:46.954 --> 45:48.038
CAROLINE?

45:49.957 --> 45:53.544
I DID GET YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

45:53.710 --> 45:54.837
[GASPS]

45:57.923 --> 46:01.593
IT'S A LITTLE
SOMETHING SPECIAL

46:01.760 --> 46:02.845
FOR A VERY SPECIAL LADY

46:03.011 --> 46:04.972
ON A VERY, VERY
SPECIAL DAY.

46:13.730 --> 46:14.857
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

46:16.733 --> 46:18.193
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

46:22.114 --> 46:23.240
MMM.

46:29.246 --> 46:31.915
CHARLES INGALLS...

46:32.082 --> 46:34.918
ON THIS VERY SPECIAL
DAY...

46:35.085 --> 46:37.546
MAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE
OF THIS DANCE?

46:38.714 --> 46:41.133
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT, OUT HERE?

46:41.300 --> 46:43.510
UH-HUH, OUT HERE.

46:43.677 --> 46:44.511
OH, CAROLINE,
COME ON.

46:44.678 --> 46:45.429
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

46:45.596 --> 46:47.431
I JUST FEEL
LIKE DANCING.

46:51.602 --> 46:53.228
ALL RIGHT.

46:53.395 --> 46:55.063
MRS. INGALLS,
MAY I HAVE THIS DANCE?

47:01.278 --> 47:03.113
HOW'S THAT
FOR REMEMBERING?

47:05.407 --> 47:07.493
I LOVE YOU.
THAT'S REMEMBERING.
