<i>ICICLE: Dude, you don't exactly have
a winning record against her.</i>

17:07.045 --> 17:08.523
<i>PSIMON:
I don't have to win.</i>

17:08.680 --> 17:11.559
<i>I only have to hold her attention
on the psychic plane...</i>

17:11.715 --> 17:14.424

your brain is pretty.</i>

18:17.749 --> 18:20.923
Psiman says enough!

18:22.020 --> 18:24.796
Bumblebee says good night.

18:24.956 --> 18:26.060
Aah!

18:27.725 --> 18:29.136
Uh-oh.

18:30.895 --> 18:32.772
"Uh-oh" is right.

18:41.439 --> 18:43.646
Do you really think
you stand a chance, blondie'?

18:43.808 --> 18:46.789
I've gone toe-to-toe
with the actual Wonder Woman.

18:46.945 --> 18:49.323
Yeah, but you never trained with her.

18:57.522 --> 18:59.195

Yes, we did it!</i>

[GROANING]

19:28.253 --> 19:30.699
It's too heavy!

19:31.155 --> 19:33.829
For me too. Time for Plan B.

19:41.399 --> 19:43.345
Good girl.

19:59.817 --> 20:03.458
They've been tending to an
empty hospital bed for months.

20:03.621 --> 20:04.656
I'm sorry.

20:04.822 --> 20:08.895
- It had to happen eventually.
- So no sign of any alien tech?

20:09.060 --> 20:11.904
None. Though what we found
was strange enough.

20:12.063 --> 20:15.636
It was clear in Shimmer's mind that
Queen Bee was acting as a middleman...

20:15.800 --> 20:19.270
delivering abducted humans
to an unknown partner.

20:19.437 --> 20:22.475
We questioned all the abductees.
Most were runaways.

20:22.640 --> 20:26.213
All were kidnapped after the destruction
of Malina Island and the Kroloteans.

20:26.377 --> 20:30.154
Sc if the Bialyans weren't kidnapping
humans for the Kralateans...

20:30.315 --> 20:32.056
then who is this partner?

20:32.216 --> 20:35.220
Ugh, another unanswered question.

20:35.386 --> 20:39.163
New questions keep the investigation
moving foward. You saved lives.

20:39.324 --> 20:42.794
And you got each other home safe.
That's a successful mission in my book.

20:43.494 --> 20:44.973
Good work, Alpha.

20:45.129 --> 20:47.040
Agh, huh?

20:53.538 --> 20:59.113
The loss of the cargo could have
severely undermined our credibility.

20:59.277 --> 21:03.885
Fortunately, we had already
collected a second shipment.

21:04.048 --> 21:08.848
Our partner should still be quite satisfied.
