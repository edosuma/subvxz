WEBVTT

00:00.130 --> 00:02.393
Previously, on
"The Real Housewives
of Potomac"...

00:03.829 --> 00:06.180
Yeah, very nice.

00:06.180 --> 00:08.008
Boobie, do you like
your new house?

00:08.660 --> 00:09.966
Right?

00:09.966 --> 00:12.795
It's definitely different
having Dean and Dylan

00:12.795 --> 00:14.623
in the house
without Michael.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.016
I'm full-time mom.

00:18.061 --> 00:22.022
Nye sent me a preliminary
budget for the tour.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.806
It's a lot of money.

00:23.806 --> 00:27.114
I'm sure I spent
over six figures

00:27.114 --> 00:29.116
to go on tour
last year.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.988
How is it getting with KK?

00:31.988 --> 00:32.902
You think I should,
like, call her?

00:32.902 --> 00:33.903
Yeah, absolutely.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.209
Oh, God,
what am I gonna say?

00:35.209 --> 00:36.819
Absolutely.
I mean, you guys are friends.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.777
Sorry for calling you a ho?

00:38.777 --> 00:40.475
I wasn't expecting, like,

00:40.475 --> 00:42.564
the firestorm
that came out of it.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.261
People are gonna think
what they want.

00:44.261 --> 00:47.830
I guess it was exacerbated
by the whole...

00:47.830 --> 00:49.484
...you in the laundromat.

00:49.484 --> 00:53.444
I'm-I'm too friendly.
I'm too nice.

00:53.444 --> 00:57.318
Robyn has some
ownership to take.

00:57.318 --> 01:00.060
We were the targets
and ordered not to talk

01:00.060 --> 01:01.844
about her truth.
- About--

01:01.844 --> 01:03.280
- We're gonna talk to her...
- Yes.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.108
...about our concerns
and feelings...

01:05.108 --> 01:07.023
- Right.
- ...as her girlfriends.

01:07.023 --> 01:08.938
If I were Juan,
I would probably operate

01:08.938 --> 01:12.028
a little bit more
cognizant or aware

01:12.028 --> 01:14.683
of what's happening
just for a minute.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.598
My heart hurts for you

01:16.598 --> 01:20.123
because it opens up
a wound for me.

01:20.123 --> 01:24.040
He is not
thinking about you,

01:24.040 --> 01:27.174
saying, "You know what?
"This is bad optics."

01:27.174 --> 01:28.479
What do y'all want me to do?
Get mad at him,

01:28.479 --> 01:30.002
and scream,
and throw a shoe at him?

01:30.002 --> 01:32.048
"Oh, my God, I can't believe
you went to the Nail Salon

01:32.048 --> 01:34.616
with Breanna?
- That's a Juan moment.

01:34.616 --> 01:35.878
I don't give a .

01:35.878 --> 01:37.880
Hold on.
They've already stole my joy.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.577
Just keep beating me up.

01:44.365 --> 01:46.367
I'm no angel,
but give me some grace,

01:46.367 --> 01:49.413
and you'll learn to adore me.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.198
You don't have
to dig for gold

01:51.198 --> 01:53.504
when you shine this bright.

01:53.504 --> 01:55.854
I just took a DNA test,
and it turns out,

01:55.854 --> 01:58.553
I 100% don't care.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.032
When they go low,

02:00.032 --> 02:03.384
♪ I just hit high notes

02:03.384 --> 02:05.908
If you're gonna test
this professor,

02:05.908 --> 02:08.128
be prepared to fail.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.347
Nigeria raised me,
L.A. made me,

02:10.347 --> 02:12.697
and Potomac
will remember me.

02:12.697 --> 02:15.178
It doesn't matter
the size of our home,

02:15.178 --> 02:17.615
I'm always the queen
of this castle.

02:17.615 --> 02:20.140
I don't ride the fence.
Honey, I am the fence.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.403
You ride me.

02:33.196 --> 02:36.286
Oh!
It's so beautiful.

02:36.286 --> 02:40.116
Oh, what are these?

02:40.116 --> 02:43.337
Chives.
These are tomatoes.

02:43.337 --> 02:45.339
Okay, I gotta--
oh, they're not, like--

02:45.339 --> 02:48.516
- Ashley!
- Oh, mom, you found me.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.431
It's beautiful here.
It smells so good.

02:50.431 --> 02:54.348
- I know.
- Hi, baby. Love you.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.436
I love you, too.
Hi, mommy.

02:55.436 --> 02:56.872
You would wanna come here.

02:56.872 --> 02:58.221
I know you wanna put all these
plants in your yard,

02:58.221 --> 02:59.527
don't you?
- I do.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.442
You know, I come here
pretty regularly.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.705
That house just gave you life,
and I love it.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.620
Yeah, it feels so good.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.231
I'm preparing my home
to welcome the ladies

03:08.231 --> 03:10.451
for my housewarming party.

03:10.451 --> 03:11.582
What's going on over there?

03:11.582 --> 03:12.627
I haven't been invited
to the house.

03:12.627 --> 03:15.151
Well, so,
I'm having a par-tay.

03:15.151 --> 03:17.109
I like that.

03:17.109 --> 03:18.589
Okay.

03:18.589 --> 03:21.853
I wanted to make sure that
I have the natural essence.

03:21.853 --> 03:25.074
I love flowers, and I just
want it to be bright

03:25.074 --> 03:27.381
and lively and--
'cause that's what I feel.

03:27.381 --> 03:28.686
I just feel this lightness.

03:28.686 --> 03:31.036
It's my little safe space,
my sanctuary.

03:31.036 --> 03:33.517
So, for the housewarming party,
I'm sorry you can't come.

03:33.517 --> 03:34.823
I'm super bummed.
- I cannot.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.259
Why you gotta pick
all your stuff on weekends

03:36.259 --> 03:38.000
that I'm working?
- I'm sorry.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.654
- I wanted to go over here.
- Okay, here, I'll grab these.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.308
- And this thing
is kinda heavy--
- Yeah, we'll leave it here.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.700
- So we gotta leave it.
- I think it's good.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.225
Oh, they got some cabbage,
and Dylan loves cabbage.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.226
Oh, my baby.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.317
Yes.
Okay, I made my list today.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.101
Mia...
- Mm-hmm.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.842
Zach, Lauren, Jules,

03:53.842 --> 03:56.279
Gizelle, Karen, Wendy,

03:56.279 --> 03:59.108
Charrisse, Amonica,
and Deborah.

03:59.108 --> 04:01.850
- Okay.
- I'm inviting my friend, Nneka.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.286
So, you remember Engazzi
from high school.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.462
- Yeah, Engazzi.
- Yeah. So, I met Nneka

04:05.462 --> 04:08.726
through Engazzi,
and she is a lawyer.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.598
She moved here to be
with her husband.

04:10.598 --> 04:11.686
They're newlyweds,
pretty much.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.122
- Wow.
- Um, I loved her energy.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.297
We just vibed so well.

04:14.297 --> 04:17.039
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.867
My friend connected
Nneka and I

04:18.867 --> 04:21.522
because Nneka had recently
moved into the area,

04:21.522 --> 04:22.958
and I just love her energy.

04:22.958 --> 04:25.526
She's fun, and I really do
like surrounding myself

04:25.526 --> 04:29.573
with empowering, positive,
intelligent women.

04:29.573 --> 04:31.009
- What's her name? Nneka?
- Nneka.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.359
- Yeah, that's different.
- Mm-hmm.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.099
Nneka, that's pretty.
That's a pretty name.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.318
Yeah, I think
it's a pretty common
Nigerian name. She's Ibo.

04:35.318 --> 04:37.015
Oh, her and Wendy-- Oh.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.365
I actually know of Wendy.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.715
She's good friends
with my cousin-in-law.

04:40.715 --> 04:43.065
I met her once at a concert,
and we had a conversation,

04:43.065 --> 04:45.067
she was nice.
- Oh, okay.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.416
- This is nice.
- Coming up. Right.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.896
- I like this, too.
- I know.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.290
Are you inviting Michael
to the housewarming party?

04:50.290 --> 04:53.336
He would be invited.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.946
You know, we did go to
the Bahamas together.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.121
We had a great time.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.949
We're still navigating
co-parenting,

04:57.949 --> 04:59.124
and it's going really well,

04:59.124 --> 05:00.169
and I don't think
either of us

05:00.169 --> 05:02.040
really wants to
rock that boat.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.390
Like, even in the Bahamas,

05:03.390 --> 05:05.479
even though we were there
together, it was like,

05:05.479 --> 05:07.742
we were two friends
with our kids.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.134
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.398
I was shocked when
we FaceTimed, and he was like,

05:11.398 --> 05:13.356
"Hi, Sheila."
I was like...

05:13.356 --> 05:15.837
Hi, Michael.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.578
I know.

05:17.578 --> 05:19.667
'Cause I was
a little worried there.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.930
Actually, mom,
he didn't try anything,

05:21.930 --> 05:24.062
like, sexual at all.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.237
It was the most respectful

05:25.237 --> 05:26.891
we've been to each other
in a long time.

05:26.891 --> 05:29.503
Yeah, I was wondering.
I'm like, dang, the Bahamas.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.243
I've been meaning
to ask this.

05:31.243 --> 05:32.897
I've been waiting.
- Oh.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.246
I know. I've been waiting.
I've been waiting.

05:34.246 --> 05:36.118
Oh, she who shall not
be named.

05:36.118 --> 05:38.076
I know.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.556
I've been waiting
for a little bit.

05:39.556 --> 05:40.688
What's up with the Candiace
thing and the Michael--

05:40.688 --> 05:43.386
the-the-- do you wanna
talk about that?

05:43.386 --> 05:44.692
Well, I don't know
anything, honestly.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.476
- You don't know anything?
- Yeah, I'm--

05:46.476 --> 05:48.348
I have no knowledge
about it.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.437
We didn't talk about it
at all, and as far as--

05:50.437 --> 05:52.743
Candiace was very verbal
about a lot of stuff.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.919
So, do you think that Michael
is gonna move forward

05:54.919 --> 05:56.791
with the lawsuit?

05:56.791 --> 05:59.446
Um, yes, he is.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.012
I think it really did affect
his business.

06:03.537 --> 06:06.844
I don't know all the nuances
of what-what he's doing.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.455
Obviously, Candiace and I
don't have a relationship.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.544
So...
- You know, it is what it is.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.502
I mean, you just can't
talk like that

06:12.502 --> 06:14.069
about people so reckless,
you know.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.070
Yeah.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.638
I know nothing
of this lawsuit

06:17.638 --> 06:19.466
between Candiace
and Michael.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.424
Anything that I learn
about it,

06:21.424 --> 06:24.427
is on the internet
just like everybody else.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.777
Quite frankly,
that is not my fish to fry,

06:26.777 --> 06:28.300
and Michael is not
volunteering any information.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.825
So...

06:30.825 --> 06:32.653
So, is it safe to say
that Candi-Can

06:32.653 --> 06:34.481
ain't coming to your party?
- Uh-uh.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.744
Oh, girl,
send her an invite, Ashley.

06:36.744 --> 06:39.181
Just send it.
- I'm sorry?

06:39.181 --> 06:41.096
There is not enough sage
in this world.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.405
- Oh, my God, absolutely not.
- You ain't right.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.015
- No.
- You ain't right.

07:13.563 --> 07:16.000
Hello, diva.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.829
Hi!

07:18.829 --> 07:21.049
How you doin'? Can we hug?
- Uh, a start.

07:21.049 --> 07:22.790
- Oh, okay,
this is how we start.
- Handshake first.

07:24.574 --> 07:25.575
Warm handshake.
- Nice to meet you.

07:25.575 --> 07:26.794
We have to have
a conversation.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.273
It's good to meet you.
- Yes, yes.

07:28.273 --> 07:29.710
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

07:29.710 --> 07:30.885
Good? Yeah, you good?
- Good, good.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.539
Girl, you chose
a beautiful place

07:32.539 --> 07:34.541
to get fresh air.
- Yes. Yeah, fresh air.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.543
- Have fresh conversation.
- Yes.

07:36.543 --> 07:39.850
- Let's walk, okay?
- All right.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.983
Thank you for coming out
and taking the time.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.768
No. Well, thank you
for the invite.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.640
Mia has had
a come to Jesus moment.

07:48.076 --> 07:49.120
Okay.

07:52.776 --> 07:55.213
That would be nice.
Uh, I'm open to that.

07:55.213 --> 07:58.216
What disappointed me the most
about Mia's treatment

07:58.216 --> 08:01.916
of me last year was her
embellishment of the truth,

08:01.916 --> 08:03.395
i.e. lying.

08:03.395 --> 08:07.356
Someone is saying that
you were dating his best friend.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.618
You guys went to Vegas.

08:08.618 --> 08:11.578
You had sex with him
in the bathroom.

08:11.578 --> 08:15.582
I never expected Mia
to get on that bandwagon

08:15.582 --> 08:17.758
and, you know,
to betray me like that.

08:17.758 --> 08:21.544
In Potomac,...
Karen, she's known for

08:21.544 --> 08:23.764
somebody that just
gets drunk,----ed up,

08:23.764 --> 08:25.330
and will any dick

08:25.330 --> 08:27.507
that will come her
- ing way.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.642
Last year,
I was in shock and appalled

08:32.642 --> 08:34.470
because I've been nothing
but a friend to you.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.298
I'm sick. I'm not sick.
I'm sick. I'm not--

08:36.298 --> 08:39.475
Like, that's nothing to play
with, and it feels like--

08:39.475 --> 08:40.737
it feels very
attention seeking for me.

08:40.737 --> 08:41.782
That's what I thought, too.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.348
I agree that it's different,

08:43.348 --> 08:44.393
but I think we gotta
hear her out.

08:44.393 --> 08:45.699
Okay.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.657
I have never stabbed you
in your back, ever.

08:47.657 --> 08:50.007
And what you did
and said about me

08:50.007 --> 08:52.314
was nothing but lies.
- What did I say about you?

08:52.314 --> 08:54.055
I'm not gonna repeat it, Mia.
You know what you did.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.013
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Let's clear it up.

08:56.013 --> 08:58.538
You lied
when you brought back a rumor

08:58.538 --> 09:00.104
about me being
with a friend of somebody.

09:00.104 --> 09:02.759
That wasn't a lie.
Someone told me that.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.021
- It wasn't a fact.
- That's not a lie.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.022
- It wasn't. It's--
- But I- I said that.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.328
But why do you repeat it
as a--

09:06.328 --> 09:08.199
I said,
"Someone said this."

09:08.199 --> 09:11.768
Let's talk about girl code.
When we are married women,

09:11.768 --> 09:13.901
you don't break girl code
the way you did.

09:13.901 --> 09:17.382
My husband was disrespected
to so many levels,

09:17.382 --> 09:18.558
at that moment.
- Right. You're right.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.863
So, the anger you hear
in my voice--

09:19.863 --> 09:21.343
'Cause I wasn't
thinking about Ray,

09:21.343 --> 09:23.084
at that moment. I just had--
- And that's the problem.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.215
I had questions about
what was going on with you.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.608
Do think about Ray.

09:25.608 --> 09:26.783
I think about Gordon
and your unit, your family.

09:26.783 --> 09:29.612
- Okay, yeah.
- Because we are talking,

09:29.612 --> 09:32.006
I feel like...

09:32.006 --> 09:33.529
there is hope.
- Absolutely.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.183
I couldn't move forward
with you today

09:35.183 --> 09:37.011
without setting boundaries
moving forward.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.665
- Yeah, I would like that.
- For me,

09:38.665 --> 09:40.884
don't bring rumors
and lies as truth

09:40.884 --> 09:42.364
because then
you're coming after

09:42.364 --> 09:44.322
what I call my institution.
- Okay.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.368
And my ins-institution
is not just Ray.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.413
And you never have to worry
about me bringing rumors

09:48.413 --> 09:50.024
about you and Gordon.
- Mm-hmm.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.634
Speaking of you and Gordon,
how are you?

09:51.634 --> 09:53.593
Girl, we're fine.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.682
Gordon's going through it.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.335
I mean, we're both goin'
through it, honestly.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.642
And you and Gordon, though,
have you-- I'm gonna--

09:59.642 --> 10:01.557
I'll ask you
'cause I don't like rumors.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.864
I know Gizelle has said,
"Embezzlement,"

10:03.864 --> 10:05.256
which is bullsh--, right?

10:05.256 --> 10:07.694
So, did the brothers argue
about how the money

10:07.694 --> 10:09.043
was being spent?
- Hmm...

10:09.043 --> 10:10.653
- Was that the--
- No, that wasn't it at all.

10:10.653 --> 10:11.828
Because it looked
very much

10:11.828 --> 10:14.135
like a little bit
of embezzlement.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.484
- Yes, it is bullsh--.
- It's not true.

10:15.484 --> 10:16.833
- Yes, no.
- Okay, it's the next step.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.226
You know, but to-to
Gizelle's defense,

10:18.226 --> 10:21.011
when it first happened,
I thought the same thing,

10:21.011 --> 10:22.447
and I remember going--
- Wait, wait, wait.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.014
You thought Gordon had
embezzled from the company?

10:24.014 --> 10:25.450
- I didn't know what to think.
- That's your husband. Oh.

10:25.450 --> 10:26.974
I know, and I said,
"Listen, is there something

10:26.974 --> 10:28.236
"that I need to know?"
- I didn't expect that answer.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.629
And then, of course,
that's not the case.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.065
- Oh.
- Yeah.

10:31.065 --> 10:33.067
Karen, you know, I was going
through a lot last year,

10:33.067 --> 10:35.460
but I'm good.
I'm in a better place now.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.549
I really am.
I don't drink anymore.

10:37.549 --> 10:38.812
I know.
Isn't that crazy?

10:38.812 --> 10:39.900
Oh, the girls
are gonna have a fit.

10:39.900 --> 10:40.944
They're gonna force it
on you. No.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.642
I do drink wine.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.252
Oh, okay,
that's good, though.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.209
I do drink wine 'cause you
can get it at the grocery store,

10:45.209 --> 10:46.515
so it's
nutritional, right?

10:46.515 --> 10:47.429
- Okay, good, good, good. Okay.
- All right.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.039
I just felt like
there was moments

10:49.039 --> 10:51.607
where it could have been
mood altering.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.609
- Okay.
- Miami's probably one of them.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.611
Wendy--
- I'm not in town for business.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.047
Oh!

10:57.047 --> 10:58.701
I should not have been
drinking at all

10:58.701 --> 11:04.185
because I was on medication.

11:04.185 --> 11:07.101
To see you flip like that
was challenging for me.

11:07.101 --> 11:08.276
I thank you for sharing,

11:08.276 --> 11:10.974
talking about mixing
pills and alcohol.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.933
That's huge.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.630
And I don't think you would
have tossed a drink then,

11:14.630 --> 11:16.197
and Wendy doesn't know that.
- No.

11:16.197 --> 11:17.720
I don't know enough about it
to talk to Wendy about it,

11:17.720 --> 11:19.635
but what I will do,
is encourage

11:19.635 --> 11:20.941
that you all get together.
- Yeah.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.420
Because we have got
to have conversations.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.508
Yeah.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.032
I am optimistic
about you and I,

11:25.032 --> 11:27.164
but I wish
the rest of the women

11:27.164 --> 11:28.644
could do what we're doing.
- Yeah.

11:28.644 --> 11:29.950
And I feel like
there's such--

11:29.950 --> 11:31.473
Talking it out is
very healthy, right?

11:31.473 --> 11:32.779
That's true.
That's very true.

11:32.779 --> 11:33.997
And that's where the group
needs to get to.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.782
This is what girls
are supposed to do.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.132
We're supposed to hash it out,
say what needs to be said,

11:38.132 --> 11:39.524
and then move on.

11:39.524 --> 11:42.484
When you betray me,
ask Gizelle.

11:42.484 --> 11:45.008
It takes me forever
to forgive you.

11:45.008 --> 11:47.794
So, there's no going lower
for Mia for me.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.884
I expect Mia to flip her ass
like a light switch

11:50.884 --> 11:52.624
where I'm concerned.
We'll see.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.496
We'll see what's
convenient for her.

11:54.496 --> 11:55.889
Yes.
- Thank you so much for

11:55.889 --> 11:57.760
meeting with me today.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.022
I have to teach you
how to shake with intention.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.242
I-I-- no, this is
how we shake, you ready?

12:02.896 --> 12:04.811
Da-da-da-da-da.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.160
I like that one, too.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.204
All right, babe.

12:07.204 --> 12:08.118
Thank you. Oh.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.338
Mmm. Not yet.

12:10.338 --> 12:11.774
Coming up next...

12:11.774 --> 12:12.906
In light of the fact

12:12.906 --> 12:14.995
that the laundry mat picture
came out,

12:14.995 --> 12:16.997
why would you put yourself
in a position

12:16.997 --> 12:18.694
to be photographed, again?

12:18.694 --> 12:22.045
I don't care!

12:32.795 --> 12:35.363
I never opened this.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.626
Aww, thanks, Heather.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.323
What?

12:40.977 --> 12:42.022
Oh, they're mag--
I thought they were,

12:42.022 --> 12:43.806
like, gummy-- gummies.

12:43.806 --> 12:44.938
They're vitamin gummies.

12:44.938 --> 12:47.505
Okay, this is cute.

12:48.942 --> 12:51.248
Oh, it's
a black man at my door.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.643
Hello, black man.
- Hey, ho.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.036
How are you?
- How you doin'?

12:56.036 --> 12:57.777
- Good to see you.
- Hi.

12:57.777 --> 12:58.908
I feel like I just
saw you.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.605
- You did.
- So, I did, probably.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.042
Have you seen my office?

13:02.042 --> 13:03.521
No, I've seen it
on Facetime.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.349
Oh! Oh.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.832
It's not done.

13:09.832 --> 13:12.530
But, you know.
- Okay, I like it.

13:12.530 --> 13:13.836
'Cause we need a desk.
- We do--

13:13.836 --> 13:15.795
yeah, so, my desk--
- This is-this is ghetto.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.926
- It is ghetto.
- Yeah.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.493
Chris calls it
a barbecue table.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.844
Yes, and church chairs.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.237
Have a seat.
- Okay, okay.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.499
So, what's popping?
- Chile...

13:24.499 --> 13:25.717
Well, I guess I should
be telling you that.

13:25.717 --> 13:26.849
I should be telling you
what's popping.

13:26.849 --> 13:27.763
Yeah, you tell me
what's popping.

13:27.763 --> 13:28.982
Okay, so...

13:28.982 --> 13:30.548
So, we gotta sort
through some things.

13:30.548 --> 13:33.725
So, you know, we're
currently, like, recording

13:33.725 --> 13:35.989
new music to ultimately--
- Right.

13:35.989 --> 13:38.513
You're getting out of
your Monarch contract

13:38.513 --> 13:39.688
and situation.
- Mm-hmm.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.124
And looking forward
to a major label.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.517
- Monarch has been great.
- Yeah.

13:42.517 --> 13:43.910
Like, it was a great...

13:43.910 --> 13:46.173
first start.
- First.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.915
We just gotta finish out
this "Deep Space" tour.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.133
Oh, God.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.701
Second leg is
happening soon,

13:52.701 --> 13:54.311
in-in, like, tomorrow.
- Yes.

13:54.311 --> 13:57.793
The way that music business
works is,

13:57.793 --> 14:00.448
you have a contract
with a label.

14:00.448 --> 14:03.451
My contract with Monarch
will be up soon.

14:03.451 --> 14:05.888
As I'm looking
to grow as an artist,

14:05.888 --> 14:08.760
I have to grow
the machine around me.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.589
So, moving away
from Monarch is

14:11.589 --> 14:13.200
really just the next step

14:13.200 --> 14:16.681
in the process of
world domination.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.118
You know,
we're venturing into

14:18.118 --> 14:20.381
some new venues
and new cities

14:20.381 --> 14:21.861
that we've never gone into.
- Yeah.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.906
St. Louis, Pittsburgh,
New York.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.299
New York.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.170
Um, but then going back
to Chicago and Atlanta.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.868
Like, we have
our openers kinda--

14:28.868 --> 14:29.956
I have some ideas
for Atlanta.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.392
Got some ideas
for Nashville.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.915
We gotta think about
somebody for Chicago.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.134
Mm-hmm.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.787
So, I have an idea
of somebody

14:35.787 --> 14:38.007
I think you should
maybe consider.

14:38.007 --> 14:40.923
What do you think about having
Drew be a special guest?

14:42.882 --> 14:45.232
Is that your only option?

14:45.232 --> 14:46.929
No, I mean, 'cause
we did Chicago before.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.757
I could bring that
same girl from before

14:48.757 --> 14:51.412
that, I mean, I think--
- Yeah, we should do that.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.936
Uh, just considering
that you and Drew--

14:53.936 --> 14:55.633
she's been a part
of your Atlanta show

14:55.633 --> 14:57.200
as this little moment.
- Right.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.943
♪ No matter
what they may say ♪

15:00.943 --> 15:03.772
♪ I'm gonna be right here

15:03.772 --> 15:07.123
♪ I'm gonna love me
all the way ♪

15:07.123 --> 15:10.910
Why do you look--
giving me a little hesitation?

15:10.910 --> 15:14.174
I just don't--
I-- hmm.

15:14.174 --> 15:15.740
I mean, I--
- Let me close this laptop.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.090
What?

15:17.090 --> 15:20.484
I don't feel like I need
to do anything more

15:20.484 --> 15:23.270
musically with her.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.793
Okay.

15:24.793 --> 15:26.099
- I sold out Chicago.
- Fair.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.491
Oh.
- So, I don't need--

15:27.491 --> 15:28.971
I'm just saying.

15:28.971 --> 15:33.193
I don't need Drew
or anyone of note

15:33.193 --> 15:35.586
to bring butts
to the seats.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.153
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.373
I'm tired.
I'm the tired.

15:39.373 --> 15:40.374
This is why you're
being difficult

15:40.374 --> 15:41.375
about the Chicago show.
- No.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.898
- Oh, okay, got it.
- See, no.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.334
My edges hurt.

15:44.334 --> 15:45.640
- You need to start rehearsing.
- My vagina hurts.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.381
I'm not gonna ask you
why your vagina hurts,

15:47.381 --> 15:49.470
but that's between
you and Chris.

15:56.172 --> 15:59.828
All right.
So, we have...

15:59.828 --> 16:01.786
This is...

16:14.712 --> 16:15.887
What you doin'?

16:15.887 --> 16:19.021
I'm bagging all of
my new supplements.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.937
- Oh.
- So I make sure I take 'em.

16:21.937 --> 16:23.895
So, I have a bunch.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.027
- That's awesome.
- I'm trying to fix

16:25.027 --> 16:28.030
all of the things
that my nutritionist

16:28.030 --> 16:31.164
has come up with that
I am, like, deficient in.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.730
What are you about to do?

16:32.730 --> 16:34.036
Uh, run some errands.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.690
- Run some errands, okay.
- Yeah.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.561
Well, um...

16:37.561 --> 16:39.041
I know you don't care
about women's business,

16:39.041 --> 16:42.523
but, um, I wanted
to, like, update you

16:42.523 --> 16:45.874
on the things that
the women have been say--

16:45.874 --> 16:47.267
talking about.
- Mm-hmm.

16:47.267 --> 16:50.183
Um, so, recently,

16:50.183 --> 16:52.272
Gizelle invited me
over to her house.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.883
I'm like, okay, great.
- Oh, crap.

16:54.883 --> 16:57.364
- So, I get there.
- Mm-hmm.

16:57.364 --> 17:00.628
And it's pretty much
turned into

17:00.628 --> 17:02.891
what I felt like was,
like, an intervention.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.371
What?

17:04.371 --> 17:06.851
This really feels like
this is a protect Juan campaign.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.201
It's not.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.072
Take the world out
of the equation.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.813
He should not be out
in public

17:11.813 --> 17:12.944
with other women, period.
- No.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.250
Do they know we had conversations

17:14.250 --> 17:16.078
about this prior?
- Um, right, and I'm just--

17:16.078 --> 17:17.384
that's the thing
what I'm trying to, like,

17:17.384 --> 17:19.125
help them understand,
like, okay,

17:19.125 --> 17:23.172
just because, like,
this stuff is news to you.

17:23.172 --> 17:25.044
- Mm-hmm.
- Like...

17:25.044 --> 17:27.698
it's not news to me.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.961
Her thing, I guess was,
like, in light of the fact

17:29.961 --> 17:32.312
that the laundry mat picture
came out,

17:32.312 --> 17:34.140
why would you put yourself
in a position

17:34.140 --> 17:36.011
to be photographed, again?

17:36.011 --> 17:38.840
I don't care!

17:41.712 --> 17:43.714
What? I'm not going
to live my life?

17:43.714 --> 17:46.978
- Right, and-and so that's--
- Like, my-my circle is tight.

17:46.978 --> 17:48.458
I don't deal with
a lot of people already.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.939
But she's making it
about me

17:50.939 --> 17:52.593
and how that makes me look.

17:52.593 --> 17:55.248
And I'm like, well, I don't care
how it makes me look.

17:55.248 --> 17:56.945
- Oh, that's--
- And so, she wants me

17:56.945 --> 17:58.425
to be mad at--

17:58.425 --> 17:59.774
Well, get mad.
Go ahead, get mad.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.080
- I-I won't say-- okay.
- Get mad, Robyn.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.124
Curse me out, please.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.386
How dare you?

18:03.386 --> 18:04.735
Curse me out.
Come on, I'm serious.

18:04.735 --> 18:05.780
Get mad.

18:05.780 --> 18:06.694
- No, but I'm not mad.
- Get mad.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.087
I need you to get mad.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.436
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.655
- No, no, so what I--
- Start throwing apples

18:11.655 --> 18:14.223
and oranges and break glasses.
- Right.

18:14.223 --> 18:15.659
- Get mad, please.
- Right, you want me to,

18:15.659 --> 18:17.922
like, key-key your car.
- So Gizelle can be--

18:19.228 --> 18:20.621
I don't-- I don't know.

18:20.621 --> 18:22.405
People always got
somethin' to say.

18:22.405 --> 18:25.104
Everybody have issues
that they deal with.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.366
Right.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.977
And some people
handle them differently.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.500
Gizelle is different
than Robyn.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.155
Like--
I mean, I don't care.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.681
I don't give a damn
what these ladies think

18:37.681 --> 18:39.248
about anything.

18:39.248 --> 18:41.163
So, you know, they
can have at it.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.338
They can have fun chitchatting

18:42.338 --> 18:43.687
and talking
amongst themselves.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.385
I don't care.

18:46.647 --> 18:49.345
All right, so, just
checking in with you.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.260
How are you doing since,

18:51.260 --> 18:52.392
um, you've--
- I'm fine.

18:52.392 --> 18:53.958
What, work?
- Yeah.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.395
I'm cool.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.571
It just--
you know, I'll figure it out.

18:57.571 --> 19:00.443
Yeah, but you're, like,
you know, making calls.

19:00.443 --> 19:01.836
Making-- you know.
- Yeah, I'm commun--

19:01.836 --> 19:03.011
- Keeping your eyes open.
- I'm trying.

19:03.011 --> 19:04.186
You know, there's
a lot of time left.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.318
- Yeah.
- I'm not...

19:05.318 --> 19:07.494
going to rush the process.
- Sh--.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.583
You know, I know
we did everything

19:09.583 --> 19:12.934
at a high level
at my previous job.

19:12.934 --> 19:15.110
It's just unfortunate,
you know,

19:15.110 --> 19:17.460
I have a-a lawsuit.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.723
- Yeah.
- Unfortunate lawsuit.

19:21.551 --> 19:24.075
Knowing what I know,

19:24.075 --> 19:27.383
Juan not only
didn't do anything wrong.

19:27.383 --> 19:28.950
He did everything right

19:28.950 --> 19:30.604
and everything
within his power.

19:30.604 --> 19:35.391
So, I believe
in my whole heart

19:35.391 --> 19:38.220
that he's not liable
for any of it.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.266
It'll be-- it'll--
- That's very unfortunate.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.354
It'll be a blessing.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.051
'Cause all I do is
love my guys!

19:43.051 --> 19:44.357
It'll be a blessing
when the lawsuit

19:44.357 --> 19:45.575
is resolved.
- All I do is love my guys.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.969
- I know it.
- I love my guys hard.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.059
- I know.
- And they love me back.

19:51.059 --> 19:52.365
And that's unfortunate.

19:52.365 --> 19:53.583
I'm really okay.

19:53.583 --> 19:54.976
I know things are going
to work out

19:54.976 --> 19:57.718
'cause--
- Right, yeah. Um--

19:57.718 --> 19:59.023
I have everybody's
best interests.

19:59.023 --> 20:00.199
I really do.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.766
I put people before me
most of the time.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.725
As do I.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.816
Coming up next...

20:08.816 --> 20:10.905
We still don't have a name
for this show, by the way.

20:10.905 --> 20:11.949
Okay.

20:11.949 --> 20:14.256
Wendy's Wisdom.

20:14.256 --> 20:17.564
No.

20:33.536 --> 20:36.322
Thanks, babe.
This dog is going crazy.

20:38.193 --> 20:39.586
Ready to see the house?
- Yep.

20:43.372 --> 20:46.767
Hello.
This looks great.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.159
Baby, be careful
where you're stepping.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.248
- Hey.
- Hello. How are you?

20:49.248 --> 20:50.292
- Hi, Jim.
- How are you?

20:50.292 --> 20:51.685
How are you doing?

20:51.685 --> 20:53.034
- Nice to see you again.
- Hi, Doctor. How are you?

20:53.034 --> 20:54.383
- How you doin', my friend?
- Nice to see you.

20:54.383 --> 20:55.776
- Nice to see you.
- This is looking good, Jim.

20:55.776 --> 20:56.516
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah, I love it. Thank you.

20:56.516 --> 20:57.952
My name is Nneka Ihim.

20:57.952 --> 21:01.216
I come as I am, and what I am,
honey, is remarkable.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.960
20854, baby.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.616
I just recently closed on
a beautiful home in Potomac.

21:09.616 --> 21:12.488
My house is five bedrooms,
five bathrooms,

21:12.488 --> 21:15.404
6,000 square feet,
beautiful deck.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.319
And we're gonna keep
this chandelier, right?

21:17.319 --> 21:19.190
No, we're not keeping
that chandelier.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.540
I'm actually surprised
it's still up.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.672
That's going in the garbage.

21:22.672 --> 21:25.327
Okay, now, what is this,
the primary bathroom?

21:25.327 --> 21:26.807
Yeah, that's the bathroom,
primary bathroom.

21:26.807 --> 21:28.635
Oh, my gosh, we have
some work to do in here,

21:28.635 --> 21:31.202
but I like that progress
is being made.

21:31.202 --> 21:32.465
This means that
our primary bathroom

21:32.465 --> 21:33.857
is gonna be done soon,
because it's empty,

21:33.857 --> 21:35.337
which means something else
has to come in.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.860
There will be no bags
in this bathroom, right?

21:37.992 --> 21:39.341
There will be no bags, okay?
No bags.

21:39.341 --> 21:40.690
I want, like, a nice--
- Okay, I can just sit

21:40.690 --> 21:42.866
in my little tub in peace
without any--

21:42.866 --> 21:44.651
You don't take baths.
What tub are you talking about?

21:44.651 --> 21:46.217
I just-- this is
the first time I want to do it.

21:46.217 --> 21:47.349
Okay, now that you
moved to Potomac,

21:47.349 --> 21:48.872
you wanna take baths.
- Yes, please.

21:48.872 --> 21:50.004
- Okay, got it, got it.
- I want to sit down in there

21:50.004 --> 21:51.919
and just do what
people do in those tubs.

21:51.919 --> 21:53.834
You know, I never knew
generational wealth

21:53.834 --> 21:57.141
was a problem until I got
delayed for my closing.

21:57.141 --> 21:58.708
The mortgage company
found out

21:58.708 --> 22:01.842
that I had other properties
that I had failed to list,

22:01.842 --> 22:04.584
two lakefront properties
in Wisconsin,

22:04.584 --> 22:07.630
a property in Florida,
two properties in Maryland.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.066
And a property in Georgia.

22:09.066 --> 22:12.809
And we have several properties
in Nigeria, I think.

22:14.158 --> 22:18.380
Oh, my gosh, my closet!
Look at how spacious it is.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.555
What is the color gonna be?

22:19.555 --> 22:21.688
This is gonna be
the same, ebony.

22:21.688 --> 22:23.429
No, I'm talking about
the office or what.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.561
- No, this is my closet.
- Oh, this is a closet?

22:25.561 --> 22:27.781
- Jim, don't give him ideas.
- All right.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.217
- It's a guest bedroom.
- Yes.

22:29.217 --> 22:30.392
Okay.

22:30.392 --> 22:31.567
Or maybe it's
my baby's bedroom. Okay.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.395
This is gonna be
for one of the twins.

22:33.395 --> 22:36.224
Iyke is a medical doctor
by day,

22:36.224 --> 22:42.012
a scrubs model by afternoon,
nightclub owner by night.

22:42.012 --> 22:44.406
I'm gonna go see
what's going on upstairs.

22:44.406 --> 22:45.799
And see you later.
Thank you.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.366
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.497
What do you think?

22:48.497 --> 22:49.716
I want you to do
what you're doing.

22:49.716 --> 22:51.370
You're doing a fantastic job,
as always.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.937
What I really was proud of,
is that you already, you know,

22:53.937 --> 22:56.723
assigned rooms to our twins.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:56.723 --> 22:59.552
My husband, Iyke, and I
definitely plan to have kids.

22:59.552 --> 23:02.511
It's been a struggle,
so far, I would say.

23:02.511 --> 23:05.514
You just came back
from a work trip.

23:05.514 --> 23:06.820
You didn't beat off
while you were there, right?

23:06.820 --> 23:09.300
'Cause we need all your sperm.
- Just one time.

23:09.300 --> 23:10.606
Are you serious?

23:10.606 --> 23:11.912
When I wake up
in the morning,

23:11.912 --> 23:13.696
the first thing I'll do
is test my LH

23:13.696 --> 23:15.524
to see if I'm ovulating.

23:15.524 --> 23:18.571
Also, take my multivitamins,
my prenatal vitamins.

23:18.571 --> 23:21.051
I take all those
with a glass of champagne

23:21.051 --> 23:22.879
because I start my day
with bubbles,

23:22.879 --> 23:24.794
and I end my day
with bubbles.

23:24.794 --> 23:27.144
Just hopefully get closer
to conceiving.

23:27.144 --> 23:28.450
Look at him.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.626
Oh, my baby love--
my baby love.

23:30.626 --> 23:31.888
He's passed out.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.063
He's tired of
hearing you argue. Animal--

23:33.063 --> 23:35.805
Let's see if
he likes his new house.

23:35.805 --> 23:37.851
Wow, goes straight to you.
- Uh-huh.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.156
Not even the person
who bathes him,

23:39.156 --> 23:40.941
and feeds him, and loves him.

23:46.816 --> 23:50.994
Hello.

23:50.994 --> 23:53.606
Oh.

23:53.606 --> 23:56.565
- Hey, girl.
- I'm out of breath.

23:56.565 --> 23:59.002
Hi, beautiful.
- Hey.

23:59.002 --> 24:00.700
- How are you doing?
- You look so pretty.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.050
You look so gorgeous,
and you smell good.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.487
- Thank you.
- Oh, this is cute.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.749
Right?

24:06.749 --> 24:09.186
Okay, this is, like,
a vibe a little bit.

24:09.186 --> 24:11.319
- Right?
- Okay.

24:11.319 --> 24:12.625
Mm-hmm.

24:12.625 --> 24:15.018
It gives me
Harlem renaissance meets, like,

24:15.018 --> 24:16.542
a museum.

24:16.542 --> 24:20.328
It feels like no evil spirits
have been in it.

24:20.328 --> 24:21.851
Exactly.

24:21.851 --> 24:26.073
I am looking for studio space
because I am starting...

24:27.727 --> 24:30.947
My own talk show!

24:30.947 --> 24:32.688
This show is
going to be different.

24:32.688 --> 24:35.952
It is going to talk about
serious issues

24:35.952 --> 24:38.259
but also issues that
we talk about

24:38.259 --> 24:39.913
every day with our friends.

24:39.913 --> 24:42.785
I give you a little politics,
but I give you a little ratchet.

24:42.785 --> 24:45.353
I am a multi-hyphenate,
multi-hyphenate,

24:45.353 --> 24:46.528
multi-hyphenate.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.182
I am a multi-hyphenate.

24:48.182 --> 24:51.968
I am a mom, a wife,
a professor, an author,

24:51.968 --> 24:54.231
entrepreneur,
a talk show host.

24:54.231 --> 24:56.538
I can be many things.

24:56.538 --> 24:59.846
You know, if they can't,
sucks for you.

24:59.846 --> 25:02.501
Gonna have
a-an interview space.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.632
Mm-hmm.

25:03.632 --> 25:05.112
And then
we're going to have, like,

25:05.112 --> 25:07.984
when we were talking about,
like, a-a call to action.

25:07.984 --> 25:10.813
The ultimate goal
for this talk show

25:10.813 --> 25:13.512
is that it catches the eyes,
the ears,

25:13.512 --> 25:15.731
the attention
of a major network.

25:15.731 --> 25:20.083
I would love if my show
could be on Bravo, E!,

25:20.083 --> 25:24.740
MSNBC, Netflix, HBO.
That would be the dream.

25:24.740 --> 25:29.136
So, doing something like this,
it allows us, you know,

25:29.136 --> 25:32.487
the freedom to just come in
and make it ours.

25:32.487 --> 25:33.923
Right.
I get what you're saying.

25:33.923 --> 25:36.578
Like, if I have Yvonne Orji,
and we wanna cook, like,

25:36.578 --> 25:37.666
some Nigerian food,
that episode...

25:37.666 --> 25:38.928
Yes, yes, yes.

25:38.928 --> 25:41.191
we could use the stove
over there.

25:41.191 --> 25:44.586
I have known Marsha
since I was 19 years old.

25:44.586 --> 25:47.589
She has done work
in the producer realm,

25:47.589 --> 25:49.156
so I reached out to her.

25:49.156 --> 25:52.159
One interview, I wanna do,
like, coffee table.

25:52.159 --> 25:53.769
The thing is,
this is the space.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.554
We can do whatever we want
with this space.

25:55.554 --> 25:56.990
- With this space.
- Right.

25:56.990 --> 25:58.339
She's produced
different shows,

25:58.339 --> 26:01.864
some of which have appeared,
like, at Sundance.

26:01.864 --> 26:04.301
I think, maybe.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.566
I think.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.002
We have to start
going over stuff

26:09.002 --> 26:11.787
because we haven't talked about
the P.A. and, uh--

26:11.787 --> 26:13.397
Okay, I think
I have a good P.A. for us.

26:13.397 --> 26:15.574
- I have one, too.
- Okay, good, awesome. Okay.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.618
- Yes, I have one, too.
- Okay.

26:16.618 --> 26:21.275
- Uh, and--
- What's a P.A.?

26:21.275 --> 26:22.624
- The production assistant.
- Okay, production assistant.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.017
Okay, got it.
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

26:24.017 --> 26:25.801
As far as budget,
I know you always get on me

26:25.801 --> 26:28.195
because I have not
told you a budget.

26:28.195 --> 26:31.372
- Can you tell me?
- No, but I'll tell you this.

26:31.372 --> 26:32.416
Okay.

26:32.416 --> 26:34.505
Between
the pre-production cost--

26:34.505 --> 26:35.811
Mm-hmm.

26:35.811 --> 26:37.813
And the price
for renting out this place,

26:37.813 --> 26:39.510
we are over budget.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.469
Yeah, but that's not a lot.

26:41.469 --> 26:45.865
But I don't expect my budget
to be the same budget as Oprah.

26:45.865 --> 26:49.608
I can hear a lawnmower.
Is this soundproof?

26:49.608 --> 26:52.393
- Uh, no.
- No.

26:52.393 --> 26:54.482
There's soundproof studios,
though, that--

26:54.482 --> 26:55.962
- Yes.
- Okay.

26:55.962 --> 26:58.051
So, that's a note.
- Yeah.

26:58.051 --> 26:59.922
We still don't have a name
for this show, by the way.

26:59.922 --> 27:03.926
- Okay.
- How about Zen Wen?

27:03.926 --> 27:05.667
Is that what you really
want it to be?

27:05.667 --> 27:07.016
Okay, all right. Okay.

27:07.016 --> 27:13.370
How about, um, Wendy's Wisdom?
- No.

27:13.370 --> 27:15.851
What?

27:15.851 --> 27:21.291
Wine With Dr. Wendy
and then, each episode,

27:21.291 --> 27:23.685
I have a glass of wine.
I don't want it to be newsy.

27:23.685 --> 27:24.991
I want it to be conversational.

27:24.991 --> 27:26.732
And I always talk with my hands,
and I just--

27:26.732 --> 27:28.690
You're making my cheeks hurt.

27:28.690 --> 27:32.259
I'm glad you're excited.

27:32.259 --> 27:34.087
Coming up next...

27:34.087 --> 27:35.697
- Open up.
- Open up, Gizelle.

27:35.697 --> 27:36.829
- Knees together.
- I-I'm open, baby.

27:36.829 --> 27:37.917
Aren't you dating a young man?

27:37.917 --> 27:40.528
Oh, yeah, listen,
I'm wide open.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.095
Wide, wide, wide.

27:42.095 --> 27:43.792
Oh, my God, Gizelle.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.063
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:54.063 --> 27:55.848
I have a few girlfriends
joining me.

27:55.848 --> 27:56.849
All right.
My name is Allie.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.198
I'll be your instructor today.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.895
So, you can put your things
here in the cubby.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.114
Um, when your friends get here,

28:01.114 --> 28:03.464
we can show them
this area, as well.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.945
Hi, there.
- Ashley.

28:05.945 --> 28:07.773
- What's going on, babe?
- Pilates.

28:07.773 --> 28:10.471
Good to see you.
- Oh, wow.

28:10.471 --> 28:12.778
Hi.
- Hi.

28:12.778 --> 28:15.345
Girl, you look so good.
- Thank you.

28:15.345 --> 28:16.869
Good to see you, Mia, again.
We're doing our--

28:16.869 --> 28:19.393
Yes, nice to meet you.

28:19.393 --> 28:20.873
- What's-what's the handshake?
- Good to see you, again.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.048
We'll talk about it.

28:22.048 --> 28:23.092
We're doing a reset
of our friendship.

28:23.092 --> 28:24.093
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, you did a reset.

28:24.093 --> 28:25.138
Okay.
- So we can move forward.

28:25.138 --> 28:27.749
So, let me get you
set up here.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.142
I have new boobs.
Is this okay?

28:29.142 --> 28:30.534
This is totally fine
with new boobs.

28:30.534 --> 28:31.666
Okay, all right.

28:31.666 --> 28:33.146
Chin to chest
and slowly lift up.

28:33.146 --> 28:36.236
I would like to introduce you
to Demi and Diamond.

28:40.022 --> 28:41.720
I got them about two months ago,

28:41.720 --> 28:44.766
and I'm really happy
with my decision.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.333
I like them.

28:46.333 --> 28:49.075
Go ahead and lie down,
and we're gonna slide these

28:49.075 --> 28:51.338
over those feet.
- Oh, yes, okay.

28:51.338 --> 28:53.949
- All right, perfect.
- Not for the faint of heart.

28:53.949 --> 28:54.994
- Hey, girl.
- Just in time.

28:54.994 --> 28:57.213
What in the world?

28:57.213 --> 28:58.606
Y'all are ready--
- Come on, Gizelle.

28:58.606 --> 29:01.174
Come on. We ready.
- Y'all are ready for action.

29:01.174 --> 29:03.393
I mean, I like vaginas,
but I didn't know that

29:03.393 --> 29:05.178
they were gonna welcome me
at the door.

29:05.178 --> 29:07.702
Legs are in the air, honey.

29:07.702 --> 29:08.790
Okay, so,
these are the reformers.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.096
Hi, booty.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.794
Ladies, have you guys
ever been on a reformer?

29:12.794 --> 29:14.013
Yes.

29:14.013 --> 29:14.927
You're gonna put your head
in the pillow.

29:14.927 --> 29:16.276
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

29:16.276 --> 29:17.277
Feet forward.
And I made yours longer, Mia,

29:17.277 --> 29:18.278
so you won't feel
too crunched up.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.409
- Okay, let's get it.
- All right.

29:19.409 --> 29:21.107
I want you all
to work out with me

29:21.107 --> 29:23.022
as I prepare for
the triple 20.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.850
I know Pilates is something
that you think

29:24.850 --> 29:26.852
I pulled out of the hat,
and I did

29:26.852 --> 29:28.854
'cause I wanna keep y'all
in shape.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.986
Listen,
you all know that my mom

29:30.986 --> 29:32.771
was a cardiovascular patient, right?

29:32.771 --> 29:34.337
- Yes.
- Right.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.383
She had a triple bypass.
I'm approaching the triple 20.

29:36.383 --> 29:38.254
Time out.
What the hell is a triple 20?

29:38.254 --> 29:39.473
Triple is gonna be
what's it's gonna be

29:39.473 --> 29:40.909
in June for the party.
- Twenty, forty...

29:40.909 --> 29:42.955
She's about--
she's about to be 60, honey.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.478
So, I went for all of
the tests

29:44.478 --> 29:51.398
which would scare you--
MRI, calcium, EKGs,

29:51.398 --> 29:54.836
stress test, you know, blockage
and what have you.

29:54.836 --> 29:58.405
I still choke up
when I say it.

29:58.405 --> 30:01.669
Calm down.

30:01.669 --> 30:08.894
I have 5% of calcium
in my carotid arteries.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.286
Yeah.

30:10.286 --> 30:11.984
But that is a number
that cannot hurt me, okay?

30:11.984 --> 30:13.550
- Oh, okay, okay.
- Okay, yeah.

30:13.550 --> 30:14.856
- It's not life threatening.
- So, that's why we're here?

30:14.856 --> 30:16.162
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you have a blockage.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.859
- It's not a blockage.
- It's a...?

30:17.859 --> 30:19.382
- A deposit.
- A deposit, okay.

30:19.382 --> 30:20.731
All right.
Karen, we support you.

30:20.731 --> 30:21.863
We here.
- I know.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.343
The good news is,
I caught it in time,

30:23.343 --> 30:26.912
and diet and just being vigilant
about my health

30:26.912 --> 30:29.436
will stop any more buildup.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.873
I-I-I don't even know
what-what to equate that to.

30:31.873 --> 30:34.615
Five percent buildup
in your heart?

30:34.615 --> 30:36.095
Huh.

30:36.095 --> 30:38.924
Does that mean that
you need to clean your ears?

30:38.924 --> 30:42.710
All right, triple 20,
let's go.

30:42.710 --> 30:43.754
We're ready.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.887
Okay, bring your
knees to tabletop.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.802
- Okay.
- Reach your arms up to the sky.

30:47.802 --> 30:49.195
Okay.

30:49.195 --> 30:50.936
I-I don't--
what do you mean?

30:50.936 --> 30:52.502
- Come on. Come on, ladies.
- And exhale.

30:52.502 --> 30:54.678
Pull down your hands
towards your hips.

30:54.678 --> 30:55.854
Open the chest.
- Ooh, nice.

30:55.854 --> 30:56.985
- There you go.
- Yes, that's--

30:56.985 --> 30:57.768
And then lift your arms up.

30:57.768 --> 30:58.900
I can't breathe.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.380
Start pumping your arms
up and down.

31:00.380 --> 31:02.686
The pump should be
about this quick, quick, quick.

31:02.686 --> 31:05.907
Oh, my God, girl, Gizelle.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.822
- Like this?
- Yeah.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.911
Use your outer thighs.
Open up.

31:09.911 --> 31:10.999
Squeeze together
those inner thighs.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.218
- Open up, Gizelle.
- I-I'm open.

31:12.218 --> 31:14.176
- Aren't you dating a young man?
- Oh, yes.

31:14.176 --> 31:16.135
- Open up, Gizelle.
- Listen, I'm wide open.

31:16.135 --> 31:17.919
Wide, wide, wide.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.790
Oh, my God, Gizelle.

31:21.401 --> 31:22.924
Oh, Lord.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.231
Girl, I'm breaking a sweat.

31:25.231 --> 31:26.406
You are done with
your Pilates session.

31:26.406 --> 31:28.147
You guys did great. Awesome job.
- Yes.

31:28.147 --> 31:30.149
- Thank you.
- That was amazing.

31:30.149 --> 31:32.499
Can I-- can I potty?
I had to pee since I got here.

31:32.499 --> 31:33.848
Oh, go straight-straight up
to your right.

31:33.848 --> 31:36.068
- Oh, yeah, go.
- I was about to jump to pee.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.591
More importantly,
while Mia is in the bathroom,

31:37.591 --> 31:39.201
y'all are okay, you and Mia?
- They shook hands.

31:39.201 --> 31:40.550
We had--
we had a very-- no.

31:40.550 --> 31:41.769
What does--
what the hell does that mean?

31:41.769 --> 31:43.989
We were shaking hands
because Mia and I

31:43.989 --> 31:45.599
had a really strong friendship
before last year.

31:45.599 --> 31:46.817
- Yes.
- And it got-- it got bunky.

31:46.817 --> 31:47.906
Uh-huh.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.124
We had a long,
long talk about it.

31:49.124 --> 31:50.604
And I'm not fake and phony,
so I said,

31:50.604 --> 31:53.172
"Let's start off,
and we'll earn our hug."

31:53.172 --> 31:55.304
Mia, we're talking about
the handshake in the park.

31:55.304 --> 31:57.306
Listen, that handshake
was-was ridiculous.

31:57.306 --> 31:59.091
She really does not like
the handshake.

31:59.091 --> 32:00.440
But let's keep it real.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.703
When we walked through the park,
we made progress.

32:02.703 --> 32:04.923
We talked about real stuff
that affected our relationship

32:04.923 --> 32:05.924
last year.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.230
Let us not bring
rumors anymore.

32:08.230 --> 32:09.405
Let's bring facts.
- Okay, well,

32:09.405 --> 32:10.885
then on that note--
- Okay.

32:10.885 --> 32:14.367
Recently, Ashley and I
were with Robyn and Charrisse.

32:14.367 --> 32:17.631
You know, my concern
as her friend, is her.

32:17.631 --> 32:20.242
She has
come under fire tremendously

32:20.242 --> 32:23.202
as it relates to the world
and all of their opinions

32:23.202 --> 32:27.119
about her and Juan.
So, that's why I say to you,

32:27.119 --> 32:31.210
are you gonna apologize
to Robyn?

32:31.210 --> 32:32.602
For what, though?

32:32.602 --> 32:35.997
Just recently, you had
a-a woman in Georgetown...

32:35.997 --> 32:37.172
- Mm-hmm.
- With blonde hair...

32:37.172 --> 32:38.347
- Mm-hmm.
- That was a rumor.

32:38.347 --> 32:40.306
It was a rumor.
You're right.

32:40.306 --> 32:43.396
Um, and if I go by that,
I can give Robyn grace

32:43.396 --> 32:44.919
'cause I did not
have a picture.

32:44.919 --> 32:46.312
Does grace mean an apology?

32:46.312 --> 32:49.228
But I do believe that
there's some truth to it.

32:49.228 --> 32:50.490
That was a rumor.

32:50.490 --> 32:51.926
Listen, I don't know
about international.

32:51.926 --> 32:55.234
I know about domestic.
But Robyn owes me an apology,

32:55.234 --> 32:57.976
and I probably do
owe Robyn an apology.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.021
- Okay, that's fine.
That's fine.
- But how we get there,

33:00.021 --> 33:01.109
maybe you have to
facilitate that, Gizelle.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.545
- That's fair. Yeah.
- That's fine.

33:02.545 --> 33:04.460
Okay, that's fine. I will.
- All right. Fair enough?

33:04.460 --> 33:05.766
Yes.

33:05.766 --> 33:07.420
Now, my question,
update for you, Ashley.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.596
Last I talked to you,
your divorce, I think,

33:09.596 --> 33:11.467
was supposed to be finalized.
- Right.

33:11.467 --> 33:12.773
- Are you divorced?
- I am not divorced.

33:13.730 --> 33:15.297
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

33:15.297 --> 33:16.951
I am technically married,
but I live very much apart,

33:16.951 --> 33:19.693
and my name is the only name
on the deed of this home.

33:19.693 --> 33:22.348
Can you tell us why
Michael is suing Candiace?

33:22.348 --> 33:24.263
I cannot.
It's public record.

33:24.263 --> 33:26.352
How do you all
feel about Candiace?

33:26.352 --> 33:28.484
I don't know who y'all are
talking about, right now.

33:28.484 --> 33:29.964
Ma'am, no.

33:29.964 --> 33:30.660
But you and Candiace are
hot and cold all the time.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.575
Uh-uh.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.273
She told me to never
talk to her again.

33:34.273 --> 33:36.275
- Okay, hold on.
- Wait, what?

33:36.275 --> 33:37.928
Candiace had said
something at the reunion

33:37.928 --> 33:40.105
about something that I had done
or was trying to do,

33:40.105 --> 33:42.455
and I texted her proof that
that wasn't true.

33:42.455 --> 33:44.413
She says, "You have shown
yourself to be someone

33:44.413 --> 33:46.763
"who will conspire with
your castmates to lie

33:46.763 --> 33:49.157
"and embellish about very
dangerous accusations

33:49.157 --> 33:51.986
"for entertainment purposes."
I never did that.

33:51.986 --> 33:54.119
Is she coming to your
housewarming party tomorrow?

33:54.119 --> 33:56.295
- I haven't invited her.
- Oh.

33:56.295 --> 33:58.427
You're not gonna
be with us this weekend?

33:58.427 --> 34:01.474
- No. What's happening?
- Ashley's housewarming.

34:01.474 --> 34:03.345
- Oh, oh, that's right.
- Did you get invited?

34:03.345 --> 34:06.131
I don't think I did.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.655
She has an engagement
in L.A. So, she--

34:08.655 --> 34:10.265
- Oh, she's out of town.
- She's out of town anyway,

34:10.265 --> 34:11.571
so this works out fine.
- Good.

34:11.571 --> 34:12.789
- Whatever. Who cares?
- All right, Gizelle.

34:12.789 --> 34:14.095
But, guys, I have
some exciting news.

34:14.095 --> 34:15.227
- Yes.
- What is the news?

34:15.227 --> 34:17.577
I have-- I have a friend.

34:17.577 --> 34:19.753
She is so fantastic.
Her name is Nneka.

34:19.753 --> 34:22.321
She's a lawyer.
She's very intelligent.

34:22.321 --> 34:24.366
She's beautiful.
She's married to a doctor.

34:24.366 --> 34:25.324
Yeah, so she's coming to
my housewarming party tomorrow.

34:25.324 --> 34:26.325
- Nice.
- Okay.

34:26.325 --> 34:27.848
I can't wait to meet her.

34:27.848 --> 34:30.285
So, is there going to be
a special guy at the party?

34:30.285 --> 34:31.460
- That's a good question.
- No, no, no.

34:31.460 --> 34:33.332
- No special guy?
- What about you, ma'am?

34:34.724 --> 34:36.291
She's dating someone
17 years younger than her.

34:36.291 --> 34:37.510
He's like our age,

34:37.510 --> 34:39.555
so I feel like he's like
a little boy to me

34:39.555 --> 34:40.904
'cause, you know,
I like 'em older.

34:40.904 --> 34:42.384
- Oh, right.
- What?

34:42.384 --> 34:43.516
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't know
what to do with that.

34:43.516 --> 34:45.779
- I do.
- I know, clearly-- clearly.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.695
I always inspire
these girls.

34:48.695 --> 34:51.263
So, Gizelle had to pick a man
with a 17 age difference,

34:51.263 --> 34:53.439
but she went back.

34:53.439 --> 34:55.745
She went and got
a baby with a cradle.

34:55.745 --> 34:58.531
I mean, that woman was
graduating high school

34:58.531 --> 35:04.189
when Jason was in Pampers.

35:04.189 --> 35:06.234
I personally think that
this Pilates session

35:06.234 --> 35:08.410
has come to an end, uh,
and I look forward

35:08.410 --> 35:10.282
to your housewarming.

35:10.282 --> 35:11.935
Yes. We'll have
a good ol' time.

35:13.285 --> 35:15.069
Coming up next...

35:15.069 --> 35:18.377
- Thank you.
- So pretty.

35:18.377 --> 35:20.030
Congratulations on your house.
- So good to see you.

35:20.030 --> 35:21.249
Aww.

35:21.249 --> 35:23.077
I mean, I know this
is a housewarming,

35:23.077 --> 35:24.774
but I didn't know
it was a kids party.

35:24.774 --> 35:27.037
Like, the entertainment
came early.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.394
- Tables set up.
- Beautiful.

35:35.394 --> 35:38.440
Nautical theme-- we have
a little seashell on here.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.747
We prepared a little menu
that outlines everything

35:40.747 --> 35:42.140
that they're going to
receive up there.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.445
- That's good.
- So, they'll know

35:43.445 --> 35:45.055
what to expect when they
grab something to eat.

35:45.055 --> 35:47.797
It's definitely labeled here
what's vegan and gluten-free.

35:47.797 --> 35:49.147
Okay, oh, nice.

35:49.147 --> 35:49.973
Okay.
- Yeah, girl.

35:49.973 --> 35:51.279
You want a cocktail?

35:51.279 --> 35:52.106
I think I just
want a beer to start.

35:52.106 --> 35:53.281
Okay.

35:53.281 --> 35:54.369
So, no one will
serve themselves.

35:54.369 --> 35:55.240
Everything is back here.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.284
Oh, okay.

35:56.284 --> 35:58.286
Oh.
- I know.

35:58.286 --> 35:59.635
I'm gonna go
get dressed now.

35:59.635 --> 36:02.029
- All right.
- Thank you, Tillie.

36:05.554 --> 36:07.295
- Hello. How are you?
- Hi.

36:07.295 --> 36:08.731
I'm well. How are you?
- You look good.

36:08.731 --> 36:10.559
- It's good to see you, again.
- Oh, my gosh, yeah.

36:10.559 --> 36:14.346
Here, you can just let them
know what you'd like to drink.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.870
Okay. Uh, I'll do vodka.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.176
Mother Nature,
right when the party starts.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.612
It's gonna-- we think
it's gonna blow over

36:19.612 --> 36:22.832
'cause it's just--
it kinda stops and-- yeah.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.921
Hi. This is why
we got the tent.

36:24.921 --> 36:27.489
I'm really excited to have
my core group of friends

36:27.489 --> 36:31.580
and my family at my house,
my seaside in the city.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.408
I have appreciated how,

36:33.408 --> 36:36.063
irrespective of whatever
differences or disagreements

36:36.063 --> 36:39.501
we've had in the past,
they were really there for me

36:39.501 --> 36:43.853
when I was leaving Michael,
when it was just such a--

36:43.853 --> 36:46.987
a trying and emotional chapter
of my life,

36:46.987 --> 36:51.426
and I can start this new chapter
with them by my side.

36:51.426 --> 36:52.514
I gotta be under this tent.
- ... Yeah.

36:52.514 --> 36:55.517
Yeah, my hair is--

36:55.517 --> 36:57.432
Okay, Ashley.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.740
Hi.
- Oh, how are you?

37:00.740 --> 37:04.047
- I am great. Cute.
- Oh, hi.

37:04.047 --> 37:05.223
- Hi.
- How are you, babe?

37:05.223 --> 37:06.441
You look fantastic.

37:06.441 --> 37:07.399
You smell good.
- So do you. Thank you.

37:07.399 --> 37:08.704
- Hi.
- Hello, hello.

37:08.704 --> 37:09.575
- How is it going?
- You look great.

37:09.575 --> 37:10.880
- Thank you.
- All good.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.752
Oh, we have, like,
all kinds of beverages.

37:12.752 --> 37:14.580
- We have specialty cocktails.
- I brought you some Corona.

37:14.580 --> 37:15.711
That's from me.
- Oh, thank you.

37:15.711 --> 37:18.236
- This is really pretty.
- Thank you.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.541
When one door closes...

37:19.541 --> 37:20.760
- Boom, boom, boom, boom.
- There it is.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.196
That's how it works.
- Another one opens.

37:22.196 --> 37:24.285
Speaking of-- speaking
of doors, well, I know that,

37:24.285 --> 37:25.808
like, Michael has,
like, an hour rule.

37:25.808 --> 37:27.375
Like, he has to tell you
an hour in advance

37:27.375 --> 37:28.681
if he's coming.
- Uh-huh.

37:28.681 --> 37:30.900
We have some
stipulations in place.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.772
Surprise visits
are a no go.

37:32.772 --> 37:35.078
We have to give each other
at least an hour's notice.

37:35.078 --> 37:36.732
Is that still in play?

37:36.732 --> 37:38.560
I don't expect that.
I mean, he has my children.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.258
So...
- So, he's with them, chilling.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.389
- Yes, yeah.
- Okay.

37:41.389 --> 37:42.651
So, you were--
where did you go?

37:42.651 --> 37:44.392
You had a vacation.
- Bahamas.

37:44.392 --> 37:46.568
- Okay, that's cool.
- Yeah.

37:46.568 --> 37:50.746
I subscribe to, like,
we can do family things

37:50.746 --> 37:52.879
even though you, you know,
you're going through a divorce.

37:52.879 --> 37:54.968
If you guys can get along
for the kids, I love that.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.709
- Yeah.
- And we can. We do very well.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.276
We didn't have any arguments.
- Yeah. So...

37:58.276 --> 38:00.930
So, he went on the vacation?

38:00.930 --> 38:03.281
Yeah, well, yes.
Where have you been?

38:03.281 --> 38:04.717
Oh, I didn't know that.

38:04.717 --> 38:06.022
Oh, when I Facetimed you,
I don't think I told you

38:06.022 --> 38:07.285
he was there. Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.895
Oh.

38:08.895 --> 38:10.331
He-he was taking the kids on
the waterslide, at that point.

38:10.331 --> 38:12.986
So, yeah.
- Okay.

38:12.986 --> 38:14.553
My uncle is just
an old school dude.

38:14.553 --> 38:16.511
What kind of life
are you living?

38:16.511 --> 38:20.341
Are you, like, getting
a divorce or, like,

38:20.341 --> 38:22.082
creating another business?

38:22.082 --> 38:25.477
He's been with the same woman
for almost 30 years.

38:25.477 --> 38:27.522
It also makes it hard
for him to empathize

38:27.522 --> 38:28.828
and see my perspective,
you know,

38:28.828 --> 38:31.613
because he's led his life
a particular way,

38:31.613 --> 38:33.702
and it's different
than how I'm leading mine.

38:33.702 --> 38:36.662
Hey, man, I stay
in my lane, you know.

38:36.662 --> 38:39.404
- Do you?
- I-I try. I try.

38:39.404 --> 38:40.709
- Okay.
- I'm-I'm human.

38:40.709 --> 38:41.884
If she wanna veer off,
then that's her thing.

38:41.884 --> 38:45.801
Thank goodness, no.

38:45.801 --> 38:47.325
Look! Look!
- There you go. That's it.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.805
- It stopped.
- Thank you, Jesus.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.594
Hello, hello.
Oh, my God.

38:55.594 --> 38:56.769
Hey, homeowner.
- Hi, lady in lilac.

38:56.769 --> 38:59.902
Girl, yes! Yes!
All right.

38:59.902 --> 39:01.991
- Hi, babe. How are you?
- Oh, my God.

39:01.991 --> 39:03.602
How are you? I'm good.
Good to see you.

39:03.602 --> 39:05.473
How are you?
Yes, yes.

39:05.473 --> 39:06.866
- Hi, Gizelle.
- Hi.

39:06.866 --> 39:08.868
Oh, we're hugging.
I love it!

39:08.868 --> 39:10.391
What are you
drinking today, Karen?

39:10.391 --> 39:11.653
- Water, right now, darling.
- Okay.

39:11.653 --> 39:13.263
- I gotta drive back.
- I know, girl.

39:13.263 --> 39:15.265
There's a service where they
drive your car back for you.

39:15.265 --> 39:16.354
Yes, while you're in it.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.877
- There you go.
- Okay.

39:17.877 --> 39:19.226
I bet they would like to drive
my Mazi but no thank you.

39:19.226 --> 39:21.837
- Yeah.
- Not the Mazi.

39:25.188 --> 39:26.015
Hi.

39:29.802 --> 39:33.022
- Cha-ching! Cha-ching!
- Hi!

39:33.022 --> 39:34.763
- This is beautiful.
- How are you? Thank you.

39:34.763 --> 39:36.374
Thank you for coming.
- Girl, this looks
like Pleasantville.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.114
- Thank you.
- Like, I'm happy.

39:38.114 --> 39:41.074
- My little seaside chalet.
- I feel like I'm at the beach.

39:41.074 --> 39:42.380
Yeah.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.469
It's cute.

39:44.469 --> 39:47.210
Where is the water?

39:47.210 --> 39:48.690
Hi.
- Hi, Mia.

39:48.690 --> 39:50.823
Hi. So, I'm gonna
sit over here

39:50.823 --> 39:52.433
since Karen is
not hugging me anymore.

39:52.433 --> 39:53.869
Hey, Mia,
you are so welcome.

39:53.869 --> 39:56.263
- Sit right next to me.
- Where people hug.

39:56.263 --> 39:57.482
- I'm just very real. Hey, baby.
- You look beautiful.

39:57.482 --> 39:58.308
You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

39:58.308 --> 39:59.092
- You look great.
- Yes.

39:59.092 --> 40:00.528
You do, too.

40:00.528 --> 40:02.530
Would you like
a glass of champagne?

40:02.530 --> 40:05.707
Um, is the Pope Catholic?

40:10.625 --> 40:12.888
- Hi.
- This is great.

40:12.888 --> 40:14.237
Y'all did this last year.
I swear.

40:14.237 --> 40:15.935
Y'all are twinning.

40:15.935 --> 40:18.851
- You guys are matching.
- Hi, beautiful.

40:18.851 --> 40:21.288
How are you?
- I am good, Charrisse.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.856
Y'all just need to
kiss and make up already.

40:23.856 --> 40:25.074
Y'all gotta take
a picture with this.

40:25.074 --> 40:26.249
This is-- this is--
- We're good.

40:26.249 --> 40:27.599
They're twinning!

40:28.338 --> 40:29.427
- Oh, we are.
- Yes.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.340
- Hi, Karen.
- Hi, Charrisse.

40:30.340 --> 40:31.254
- How are you?
- I'm good.

40:31.254 --> 40:33.996
Happy almost summer.

40:33.996 --> 40:35.433
Do you guys wanna do
a house tour, real quick?

40:35.433 --> 40:36.521
- Yes.
- Yeah.

40:36.521 --> 40:38.131
Okay, come on.
Most of us are here.

40:38.131 --> 40:39.349
Oh, this'll be fun.

40:39.349 --> 40:41.177
I do wanna eat
somethin', chile.

40:41.177 --> 40:43.179
So, this is my
living room, obviously.

40:43.179 --> 40:46.661
Um, the-the inspiration
was coastal chic

40:46.661 --> 40:48.097
'cause I really love
neutral tones.

40:48.097 --> 40:50.796
And coming from our apartment,
which was very dark,

40:50.796 --> 40:52.841
everything just had, like,
a very bachelor feel.

40:52.841 --> 40:53.929
So, I wanted to
lighten it up.

40:53.929 --> 40:55.931
No, like, gray stone
all of that.

40:55.931 --> 40:58.368
I definitely had a lot
of great memories

40:58.368 --> 40:59.848
at the Bethany Beach house.

40:59.848 --> 41:01.241
There are some elements
of that home

41:01.241 --> 41:03.286
that I wanted to incorporate
into this house.

41:03.286 --> 41:05.071
I love it.

41:05.071 --> 41:07.073
- That's one heck of a view.
- Sorry, guys.

41:07.073 --> 41:08.770
Three women will have
to share this bathroom.

41:09.989 --> 41:11.469
Since I do live in the city,

41:11.469 --> 41:13.122
I wanted to have
that sort of escape.

41:13.122 --> 41:17.300
And I just want nautical.
Perfect timing!

41:17.300 --> 41:19.651
Hey, jeans.
- Hey, mama.

41:19.651 --> 41:22.392
- You are serving. Hi.
- Thank you, baby.

41:22.392 --> 41:23.916
Your house is serving.
This is--

41:23.916 --> 41:26.179
this is beautiful.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

41:26.179 --> 41:27.963
- Hi.
- Hey, mama.

41:27.963 --> 41:29.748
How you doing, beautiful?
- I am good. Muah.

41:29.748 --> 41:31.010
Oh, so good to see you.

41:31.010 --> 41:32.185
Hey, mama.

41:34.100 --> 41:35.797
So good to see you.
Hey, Charrisse. How you doing?

41:35.797 --> 41:37.625
Hi. I haven't
seen you in forever.

41:37.625 --> 41:39.714
Give me some love.
Good to see you.

41:39.714 --> 41:41.890
Thank you.

41:45.677 --> 41:47.548
Coming up next...

41:47.548 --> 41:48.767
Her name is Nneka.

41:48.767 --> 41:50.159
You guys actually
have a lot in common.

41:50.159 --> 41:51.987
- Okay, tell me.
- She's Ibo, as well.

41:51.987 --> 41:54.773
I talked about it
with Nneka.

41:54.773 --> 41:56.775
There was this article
about you or something being,

41:56.775 --> 41:58.211
like, Osu or something.

41:59.865 --> 42:01.301
I was like, what?

42:06.393 --> 42:07.655
- Hi.
- Hey, mama.

42:07.655 --> 42:09.309
How you doing, beautiful?
- I am good. Muah.

42:09.309 --> 42:10.484
Oh, so good to see you.

42:10.484 --> 42:11.877
Yes. Hey, Charrisse.
- Hi.

42:11.877 --> 42:13.922
I haven't seen you in forever.
Give me some love.

42:13.922 --> 42:16.229
Good to see you.
- Thank you.

42:16.229 --> 42:20.886
Oh, baby, the time
of civility is long gone.

42:20.886 --> 42:24.237
I have greeted those
who I want to greet.

42:24.237 --> 42:26.935
The others? Hmm.

42:26.935 --> 42:27.675
So, I was just saying
that this is the--

42:27.675 --> 42:29.590
this is our living room.

42:29.590 --> 42:31.766
And then our kitchen,
which I don't use very much,

42:31.766 --> 42:33.202
but I do do more now

42:33.202 --> 42:34.856
since I have to feed
the children on my own.

42:34.856 --> 42:36.989
- Okay, okay.
- Yes. All right.

42:36.989 --> 42:38.643
We'll make our way
upstairs, babe.

42:38.643 --> 42:40.427
- All right.
- Alrighty.

42:40.427 --> 42:42.124
Oh, my gosh, this is cute.
- I like this.

42:42.124 --> 42:43.909
This is very cute.
- Thank you.

42:43.909 --> 42:46.564
I am loving this for Ashley.
I love the decor.

42:46.564 --> 42:49.741
I love that it's boho chic,

42:49.741 --> 42:52.657
or, no, beachwear.
It's-it's somethin'.

42:52.657 --> 42:53.832
It's somethin'.

42:53.832 --> 42:55.790
This is where
no magic is happening.

42:55.790 --> 42:57.618
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely none.

42:57.618 --> 42:59.533
I need a closet.

42:59.533 --> 43:01.883
Can I just borrow
one of these?

43:01.883 --> 43:03.319
Cute, okay,
I like the bathroom.

43:03.319 --> 43:04.625
- Yes, lovely bathroom. Yeah.
- I like the floors.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.192
And I'll just show
you guys my kids' room.

43:06.192 --> 43:09.021
Yeah, they share this room.
- Oh, cute.

43:09.021 --> 43:11.327
- Yeah.
- We have to keep the artwork.

43:11.327 --> 43:12.807
Aww.

43:12.807 --> 43:14.417
Super cute-- very nice.
You've-you've done, Ashley.

43:14.417 --> 43:16.637
- This is beautiful, Ashley.
- Thank you, babes. Thank you.

43:16.637 --> 43:17.638
Are you guys ready to eat?
- Yes.

43:17.638 --> 43:18.596
- Yeah.
- Okay, yeah,

43:18.596 --> 43:20.467
so we can go outside to eat.

43:22.512 --> 43:24.384
- Hey, girls.
- Hi.

43:24.384 --> 43:27.169
- You been good?
- Yes.

43:27.169 --> 43:29.911
- Hi, cutie.
- I like your dress.

43:29.911 --> 43:32.610
- Thank you.
- It's so pretty.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.481
- It's so good to see you.
- Congratulations on your house.

43:34.481 --> 43:35.830
Oh, thank you.

43:35.830 --> 43:37.702
You changed it up
a little-- a little bit.

43:37.702 --> 43:42.184
Chile, now, why
is the liar here?

43:42.184 --> 43:44.230
I mean, I know this
is a housewarming,

43:44.230 --> 43:45.840
but I didn't know
it was a kids' party.

43:45.840 --> 43:48.495
Like, the entertainment
came early.

43:48.495 --> 43:50.149
And then Eddie--
I think that's the name--

43:50.149 --> 43:52.107
happy Eddie comes over.
- Who is happy Eddie?

43:52.107 --> 43:53.718
- Wendy's husband.
- Oh, chile.

43:53.718 --> 43:55.197
He was very flirty.

43:55.197 --> 43:57.069
If I didn't know he was married,
I wouldn't have known.

43:57.069 --> 43:58.157
- Yeah.
- All right.

43:58.157 --> 43:59.767
So, we're going outside.
- Yes, babe.

44:01.813 --> 44:01.987
Do we know
what this is?

44:02.901 --> 44:04.337
I don't know
what that is.

44:04.337 --> 44:08.907
How are you? Wait,
where is your nautical hat?

44:08.907 --> 44:10.996
Did you forget?

44:10.996 --> 44:12.345
- I wore blue and white stripes.
- Oh, I love it.

44:12.345 --> 44:13.694
Maybe just a little wine
and sparkling water

44:13.694 --> 44:15.000
and then a pretty garnish.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.523
Okay, shrimp.

44:16.523 --> 44:18.612
Look at this punctuality.

44:18.612 --> 44:20.962
I love it. Hi.

44:20.962 --> 44:22.877
Robyn is gonna
sit there. Yeah.

44:29.841 --> 44:31.016
Karen, where are
you sitting?

44:31.016 --> 44:32.887
Right there
beside Gizelle.

44:35.847 --> 44:37.022
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Robyn.

44:37.022 --> 44:39.851
How are you?
This is so adorable.

44:39.851 --> 44:42.157
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

44:42.157 --> 44:45.030
Hey, how are you?
- Hey, sexy.

44:45.030 --> 44:48.729
Look, I am not
hiding from anything.

44:48.729 --> 44:50.731
I'm not running
from conversations

44:50.731 --> 44:54.300
that these ladies
wanna have.

44:54.300 --> 44:57.477
So if you got somethin'
to say, then say it.

44:57.477 --> 44:58.521
Hey.

44:58.521 --> 44:59.914
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, sexy.

44:59.914 --> 45:01.524
- Hello, hello.
- Hi.

45:01.524 --> 45:03.265
- Look at you all snatched.
- This color is pretty on you.

45:03.265 --> 45:05.093
Girl, I didn't think
you were coming. I wasn't sure.

45:05.093 --> 45:07.574
- Hey, why? Am I that late?
- A little bit.

45:07.574 --> 45:08.662
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:08.662 --> 45:10.229
Hi, Karen. Hi, Deborah.
Hi, Wendy.

45:10.229 --> 45:12.100
- Hi.
- How are you?

45:12.100 --> 45:14.233
That's-- that's a pretty pink.
- Thank you.

45:16.148 --> 45:17.366
Oh, is somebody
sitting here?

45:17.366 --> 45:18.585
Oh, Ashley.
- It was Ashley. It's fine.

45:18.585 --> 45:20.413
- She's good.
- No, Ashley will be fine.

45:26.985 --> 45:30.075
- Oh, hello, beautiful.
- Hi. How are you?

45:30.075 --> 45:31.424
This is it.
I'm loving the color pop.

45:31.424 --> 45:33.774
- Thank you.
- And your tan is still bustin'.

45:33.774 --> 45:35.254
I love it.
- Oh, thank you, babe.

45:35.254 --> 45:37.256
- Oh, I got this for you.
- Oh, so sweet.

45:37.256 --> 45:38.431
Thank you.
- Yes, yes.

45:38.431 --> 45:40.172
Oh, Charrisse,
this is my friend, Nneka.

45:40.172 --> 45:41.608
- Oh. Oh, my gosh, hi.
- Hi.

45:41.608 --> 45:42.957
- Oh, you're so beautiful.
- Thank you. Thank you.

45:42.957 --> 45:44.742
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

45:44.742 --> 45:46.526
Ooh, I love the earrings.
- Girl.

45:46.526 --> 45:48.876
You wore them today,
so now they're mine,

45:48.876 --> 45:50.051
just so you know.

45:50.051 --> 45:51.966
And I will take them back.

45:51.966 --> 45:53.315
- Hi.
- Ladies,

45:53.315 --> 45:54.708
this is my friend, Nneka,
I was telling you about.

45:54.708 --> 45:55.796
- Nneka.
- Hello, everyone.

45:55.796 --> 45:57.319
- Hi.
- How are you?

45:57.319 --> 45:58.668
Oh, my gosh,
so many beautiful faces.

45:58.668 --> 45:59.974
- Yeah, this is Wendy.
- Hi.

45:59.974 --> 46:01.367
Very nice
to meet you, Nneka.

46:01.367 --> 46:02.672
Oh, my gosh, girl,
purple is my favorite color.

46:02.672 --> 46:05.414
- Oh, good. Nice to meet you.
- Wonderful.

46:05.414 --> 46:07.808
- Hi. How are you?
- Hey, I love the suit

46:07.808 --> 46:09.114
- Thank you so much.
- So beautiful.

46:09.114 --> 46:11.290
- Oh, thank you.
- Let me make my way around.

46:14.162 --> 46:18.819
I have seen her at--
I have seen her--

46:18.819 --> 46:21.474
How many times
have I seen her?

46:21.474 --> 46:24.651
I have seen her
in passing before.

46:26.174 --> 46:27.306
Hi. I'm Gizelle.

46:27.306 --> 46:28.481
Very nice to meet you.
- Hey, beautiful,

46:28.481 --> 46:29.830
beautiful, beautiful.
Nice to meet you.

46:29.830 --> 46:31.397
Hi, gorgeous.
How are you?

46:31.397 --> 46:32.833
You're so pretty.
- Hey, thank you. You, too.

46:32.833 --> 46:34.139
- Join us.
- I'm loving all the color.

46:34.139 --> 46:35.357
- Sit right here.
- Yeah, sit beside me.

46:35.357 --> 46:36.141
I've been invited
to sit somewhere.

46:36.141 --> 46:37.664
Oh, it's good. Yeah.

46:37.664 --> 46:39.144
You guys actually
have a lot in common.

46:39.144 --> 46:40.710
- Okay, tell me.
- You're both, yeah, you're--

46:40.710 --> 46:42.974
she's Ibo, as well.
- I am.

46:42.974 --> 46:44.149
- All right.
- Her name is Nneka.

46:44.149 --> 46:45.541
Oh, you're saying it
like that.

46:45.541 --> 46:46.847
It's Nneka.

46:46.847 --> 46:48.022
Well, teach them.

46:48.022 --> 46:48.893
- Okay, teach them now.
- Teach them.

46:48.893 --> 46:50.372
Okay, Nneka.

46:50.372 --> 46:52.244
The double N-- the double N
with the E is like na.

46:52.244 --> 46:53.854
- Na-- as in na.
- Na.

46:53.854 --> 46:54.986
- Saying it wrong.
- But, no, but--

46:54.986 --> 46:55.856
You didn't know
how to say it.

46:55.856 --> 46:56.988
But we're in America.

46:56.988 --> 46:58.424
We can make it
comfortable for them.

46:58.424 --> 46:59.686
Okay, Nneka.

46:59.686 --> 47:01.557
Okay, girl, I see you.

47:01.557 --> 47:03.472
Dressed to the nine.

47:03.472 --> 47:04.343
I was like,
go ahead, girl.

47:04.343 --> 47:06.780
All right.
I like you.

47:06.780 --> 47:08.564
Like, I love her little,
like, valley girl,

47:08.564 --> 47:11.393
like, hey, girl.
I'm like, yes, hey, girl.

47:11.393 --> 47:12.873
You're new here?
You're not from here?

47:12.873 --> 47:14.222
Yeah. No, I moved here
about a year ago

47:14.222 --> 47:15.397
when I got married.
- Oh.

47:15.397 --> 47:17.095
A newlywed--
congratulations.

47:17.095 --> 47:18.400
Thank you.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.620
Wendy, can we--
can we go inside for a sec?

47:23.318 --> 47:24.406
I'm gonna catch up Wendy
'cause I haven't seen her

47:24.406 --> 47:26.887
in how long?
- It's been a minute.

47:26.887 --> 47:28.193
I know.

47:30.412 --> 47:31.805
Are you okay with
sitting on the couch?

47:31.805 --> 47:32.937
Yeah, let's sit right here.

47:32.937 --> 47:33.676
It's got a little
Play-Doh on it.

47:35.243 --> 47:36.288
It's so hard for me to keep up--
- No, I know the struggle.

47:36.288 --> 47:37.376
With these boys
and their Play-Doh.

47:37.376 --> 47:38.943
No.
How are you? First of all...

47:38.943 --> 47:40.553
- Yes, babe.
- I'm proud of you.

47:40.553 --> 47:41.728
Thank you.

47:41.728 --> 47:45.036
This is a big step,
but you did it,

47:45.036 --> 47:47.473
and I know you're so big
on your boys,

47:47.473 --> 47:50.084
and the goal is always
to provide our children

47:50.084 --> 47:52.347
with a home filled with love.
- Yes.

47:52.347 --> 47:53.740
And the moment I walked
in here, I felt it.

47:53.740 --> 47:55.002
Thank you.

47:55.002 --> 47:57.526
- So, you have done your job.
- Thank you.

47:57.526 --> 47:59.398
- Do you have any children?
- We don't, girl.

47:59.398 --> 48:00.878
Are you gonna have--
do you wanna have kids?

48:00.878 --> 48:02.488
- We've been trying.
- You've been trying. Oh, nice.

48:02.488 --> 48:03.837
- Oh, are you?
- Yeah, we've been trying.

48:03.837 --> 48:05.317
It hasn't been--
- You gotta relax

48:05.317 --> 48:06.840
and don't think about it.
- You guys just got married.

48:06.840 --> 48:08.233
I feel like I've been relaxed.
It's been seven months.

48:08.233 --> 48:09.582
I called the doctor
after three months.

48:09.582 --> 48:11.018
I'm like,
"Listen, I need help."

48:11.018 --> 48:12.672
So, I went and did all my labs
and all that stuff,

48:12.672 --> 48:14.108
and, like, they said
I'm above average,

48:14.108 --> 48:15.893
which I usually am
in everything.

48:15.893 --> 48:17.938
Um...

48:17.938 --> 48:20.158
Since our interactions
last year,

48:20.158 --> 48:22.203
you have always made me
feel like I matter.

48:22.203 --> 48:24.379
I hold you in a
very special place.

48:24.379 --> 48:25.511
- Thank you.
- I want you to know that.

48:25.511 --> 48:28.514
But sometimes, Ashley--
- It's fair.

48:28.514 --> 48:30.168
Go ahead.
- I have questions.

48:30.168 --> 48:31.473
Mm-hmm.

48:31.473 --> 48:34.346
With everything that
transpired with Deborah,

48:34.346 --> 48:35.434
you remember that?
- Oh, okay.

48:35.434 --> 48:37.653
Yes, I do.
- Yeah.

48:37.653 --> 48:40.004
So, apparently,
when Chris was talking

48:40.004 --> 48:42.093
to Deborah--
- Okay.

48:42.093 --> 48:43.224
I guess Eddie,
like, came over,

48:43.224 --> 48:45.574
and the consensus
seemed to be

48:45.574 --> 48:48.664
that Eddie was, like,
being flirtatious.

48:48.664 --> 48:50.840
So they were calling him
Happy Eddie.

48:50.840 --> 48:52.973
Not Happy Eddie.

48:52.973 --> 48:55.236
I really wanna feel like
I can be like,

48:55.236 --> 48:57.282
Ashley, like,
that's my girl.

48:57.282 --> 48:59.588
I just don't want
to feel like,

48:59.588 --> 49:01.416
if the opportunity
presents itself,

49:01.416 --> 49:02.852
you will stab me
in the back.

49:16.562 --> 49:19.217
I just don't want
to feel like,

49:19.217 --> 49:21.001
if the opportunity
presents itself,

49:21.001 --> 49:22.394
you will stab me
in the back.

49:25.223 --> 49:26.528
I respect that.

49:26.528 --> 49:28.269
- I don't wanna feel that way.
- Okay.

49:28.269 --> 49:33.187
So, number one, part of
why you may not see

49:33.187 --> 49:34.884
that I am
trustworthy fully

49:34.884 --> 49:36.756
is because we just don't really
spend the time together.

49:36.756 --> 49:38.584
- Yeah.
- We haven't really had

49:38.584 --> 49:41.500
instances where we,
you know, like,

49:41.500 --> 49:44.329
kiki and do things, you know,
with our kids or whatever,

49:44.329 --> 49:45.504
and I do--
- I invited you

49:45.504 --> 49:46.505
to Kamrynn's birthday party.
- You did.

49:46.505 --> 49:47.897
I know, and that's fair.
- Yeah.

49:47.897 --> 49:49.769
And maybe that's where
my invitation ended because--

49:49.769 --> 49:51.249
That's where
your invitation ended.

49:51.249 --> 49:53.120
That's fair. I respect that.
I couldn't make that,

49:53.120 --> 49:54.600
but I do understand that.
- Yeah.

49:54.600 --> 49:56.950
And I think that that's
one area where we can--

49:56.950 --> 49:58.734
And I still-- there's so many
layers to you

49:58.734 --> 50:00.475
that I still wanna get to know.
- Same.

50:00.475 --> 50:04.044
I worry that it makes you
feel really guarded about me

50:04.044 --> 50:06.438
and maybe the group that you
don't necessarily wanna share

50:06.438 --> 50:08.483
some vulnerable things
about yourself, you know.

50:08.483 --> 50:12.792
I just want to feel
like it's in safe hands.

50:12.792 --> 50:15.795
Fair but do you not want me
to tell you things that happen?

50:15.795 --> 50:17.275
No, I want you to
tell me everything.

50:17.275 --> 50:18.885
- Okay, 'cause, I-I mean--
- I'm-I'm not that friend.

50:18.885 --> 50:20.060
I'm the friend that tell me.
- But that's what I'm saying.

50:20.060 --> 50:20.887
- Yeah.
- So, that's when I told you.

50:20.887 --> 50:22.497
- Yeah, no.
- Okay,

50:22.497 --> 50:23.629
and even though I love her,
I knew that that was something

50:23.629 --> 50:24.891
that you would wanna know.
- Yeah.

50:24.891 --> 50:29.635
Um, I will say that,
in-in that vein,

50:29.635 --> 50:34.640
so only because I talked
about it with Nneka,

50:34.640 --> 50:36.337
we just-- like,
I was talking about you

50:36.337 --> 50:38.383
and how esteemed you are,
how professional you are,

50:38.383 --> 50:39.732
and this, and that.

50:39.732 --> 50:41.212
I told her you had a--
that you were a doctor,

50:41.212 --> 50:43.301
and she was like, "Like a--
like a medical doctor?"

50:43.301 --> 50:46.130
Wendy-- doctor--
Wendy and I are friends.

50:46.130 --> 50:49.263
Wait, first of all, Dr. Wendy?
Is this medical doctor?

50:49.263 --> 50:50.743
- No.
- Okay.

50:50.743 --> 50:53.485
- It's a-a PhD.
- Okay, Doctor of Philosophy.

50:53.485 --> 50:55.356
Doctor of Philosophy?

50:55.356 --> 50:56.488
Yeah, PhD is doctor
of philosophy. Okay.

50:56.488 --> 50:57.924
Oh, doctor of--
okay.

50:57.924 --> 50:59.491
Uh, the way she said it,
I thought it was a little--

50:59.491 --> 51:01.101
she was-- I was like, okay,
I didn't know that that was,

51:01.101 --> 51:02.233
like, seemed to be--

51:02.233 --> 51:03.495
No, I have a Doctorate
of Philosophy.

51:03.495 --> 51:04.670
- I respect it.
- What, only--

51:04.670 --> 51:06.628
what only less than 1%
of the world has.

51:06.628 --> 51:08.500
I respect it immensely.

51:08.500 --> 51:10.241
Yes, I don't have it.
So, you know.

51:10.241 --> 51:11.372
Mm-hmm.

51:11.372 --> 51:14.767
Girl, let me
tell you somethin'.

51:14.767 --> 51:18.336
I worked hard
for my PhD.

51:18.336 --> 51:21.121
If it doesn't make her happy,
that's on her,

51:21.121 --> 51:25.517
but she's gonna still
address me as Dr. Wendy.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.435
- You are a lawyer.
- I am.

51:30.435 --> 51:31.523
Your husband is
a doctor, right?

51:31.523 --> 51:32.915
- Yes.
- So, do you practice law?

51:32.915 --> 51:34.352
I do practice.

51:34.352 --> 51:37.877
I'm in-house counsel for
a prominent fintech company.

51:37.877 --> 51:40.532
And then I guess, like,
there was this article about you

51:40.532 --> 51:42.360
or something being, like,
Osu or something.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.187
- Mm-hmm.
- And I was like, oh, like,

51:43.187 --> 51:44.579
this silly thing.

51:44.579 --> 51:45.885
Something had happened
where there was some rumor

51:45.885 --> 51:47.756
about her family being
shunned or something.

51:47.756 --> 51:51.064
Is that, like,
a common thing or...?

51:51.064 --> 51:52.848
Did they say why
she was being shunned?

51:52.848 --> 51:56.156
They are Osu, cursed,
or something like that.

51:56.156 --> 51:58.854
It's kind of a group of people
who were, like, offered up

51:58.854 --> 52:02.206
to this native or local king.
- Okay.

52:02.206 --> 52:04.164
And those people, like,
the families

52:04.164 --> 52:07.036
that give up their children
are considered Osu.

52:07.036 --> 52:08.342
Okay.

52:08.342 --> 52:09.865
And it's literally been
abolished, you know.

52:09.865 --> 52:11.389
It's been abolished.
So, like, it's--

52:11.389 --> 52:13.130
Like, people still remember
and, you know,

52:13.130 --> 52:15.741
don't want to necessarily
be associated with it.

52:15.741 --> 52:17.569
I don't know if she is.
I know I'm not,

52:17.569 --> 52:19.179
but I don't--
I don't know if she is

52:19.179 --> 52:20.833
or what's going on there.

52:20.833 --> 52:26.055
And she basically was like,
"Oh, Osu is, like, terrible."

52:26.055 --> 52:27.666
I was like, what?
Like--

52:33.324 --> 52:35.630
Uh-huh, that's how
I remembered it.

52:38.764 --> 52:40.635
I really said it like--
it was that tequila.

52:40.635 --> 52:43.377
Oh, I shouldn't
have drank.

52:43.377 --> 52:45.771
I had no idea what
that was at all.

52:45.771 --> 52:50.863
Um, Osu is something from,
like, ancient Gods in Nigeria.

52:50.863 --> 52:53.213
My family is not that, right?
- Okay.

52:53.213 --> 52:57.261
And it basically is people
who are considered outcasts.

52:57.261 --> 52:59.611
So, the fact that you came
to Kamrynn's sip and see--

52:59.611 --> 53:00.699
- Yeah.
- And you saw

53:00.699 --> 53:02.004
all the women
with the head ties

53:02.004 --> 53:03.397
and all the Nigerian people
partying with us,

53:03.397 --> 53:05.051
if you're an--
- The geles.

53:05.051 --> 53:07.096
- Yeah, the geles.
- Geles, yeah, I remember.

53:07.096 --> 53:08.446
Yes.
If you're an Osu,

53:08.446 --> 53:10.448
no one would come
to your events.

53:10.448 --> 53:12.014
- I see.
- No one would be around you.

53:12.014 --> 53:13.451
It's, like, forbidden.

53:13.451 --> 53:15.627
So, yes, it is a bad thing,
but that's not--

53:15.627 --> 53:17.150
it ain't me.
- Okay, good.

53:19.021 --> 53:20.545
You're coming
into the group,

53:20.545 --> 53:25.463
and you're bringing up
false blog articles,

53:25.463 --> 53:27.987
and I would just have
expected more,

53:27.987 --> 53:30.946
especially from
a fellow Nigerian.

53:35.777 --> 53:38.954
Next time, on "The Real
Housewives of Potomac."

53:38.954 --> 53:41.653
You were very adamant on
Juan because of the optics.

53:41.653 --> 53:44.612
No, no, no. I don't care that
the block is hot.

53:44.612 --> 53:48.007
I may have implied to Wendy
that Nneka was, like,

53:48.007 --> 53:51.489
sort of implying
that Wendy was Osu.

53:51.489 --> 53:53.621
Celebrants,
first communion.

53:53.621 --> 53:55.188
- You're-you're closer to God.
- Yes.

53:55.188 --> 53:58.278
Wendy's mom calls
my husband's cousin.

53:58.278 --> 53:59.497
Starts off
super creepy, like,

53:59.497 --> 54:01.063
that she has a shrine.
- What?

54:01.063 --> 54:02.456
What?

54:02.456 --> 54:05.111
In Jesus' name, amen.
