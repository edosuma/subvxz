00:24.358 --> 00:25.942
Please let me go.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.048
Who's going

00:27.049 --> 00:28.153
to rescue you now?

00:29.864 --> 00:31.991
It's Monty.

00:34.869 --> 00:36.911
Monty!

00:36.912 --> 00:38.456
Monty, whatsoever

00:38.457 --> 00:39.998
will we do?

00:39.999 --> 00:41.500
- Drink Monkey Up,
- of course.

00:41.503 --> 00:44.836
And go bananas!

00:44.837 --> 00:47.214
Let's fly.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.467
Oh, Monty.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.846
You're my hero.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.890
Monty, Monty, cheat...

00:56.891 --> 00:58.163
Cheat product name

00:58.164 --> 00:59.433

00:59.434 --> 01:01.854
- Product to camera. The big black
- box with the lens!

01:01.857 --> 01:03.688
Hey, I'm trying.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.232
Cut! Cut! Cut!

01:06.859 --> 01:08.610
- Dessy, I need
- a little help here.

01:08.613 --> 01:10.611
I'm tangled up again.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.071
I'm having a panic attack.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.532
- You're having
- a panic attack?

01:13.535 --> 01:14.825
You're only 3 feet

01:14.826 --> 01:16.116
off the ground here.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.640
Stan is not happy.

01:17.641 --> 01:19.161
He could fire us.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.726
You mean he could fire you.

01:20.727 --> 01:22.289
The drink's called Monkey Up,

01:22.290 --> 01:24.125
- and I'm the face
- of the franchise.

01:24.128 --> 01:25.586
Now, shh. I'm trying to find

01:25.587 --> 01:27.045
my happy place.

01:27.046 --> 01:28.755
Monty, Monty, snap out of it.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.631
And the Oscar goes to...

01:30.632 --> 01:33.010
Monty for Planet of the Monkeys.

01:34.302 --> 01:35.929
In your dreams.

01:35.930 --> 01:36.973
He's fine, everybody!

01:36.974 --> 01:38.014
What are you...

01:38.015 --> 01:39.892
Just another diva moment.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.771
There you are.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.857
- Take that away.
- Ugh!

01:46.860 --> 01:48.776
- I'm not putting that junk
- in this temple.

01:48.779 --> 01:51.028
That's Monkey Up,

01:51.029 --> 01:53.279
you petulant primate.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.678
Cut him down,

01:54.679 --> 01:56.075
cut him down, cut him down!

02:00.037 --> 02:02.830
There you go.

02:02.831 --> 02:03.999
You know what?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.165
I've had it with commercials.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.439
I wanna do some real acting.

02:06.440 --> 02:07.710
You hear me?

02:07.711 --> 02:09.795
Real acting.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.026
To hold, as 'twere,

02:11.027 --> 02:12.256
the mirror up to nature,

02:12.257 --> 02:14.072

02:14.073 --> 02:15.886
scorn her own image.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.973

02:19.974 --> 02:22.141
Hello? William Shakespeare?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.810
William Shakespeare?

02:23.811 --> 02:25.459
Ugh, forget it.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.105
I told you Stan's a hack.

02:27.106 --> 02:29.066
I've had just about enough

02:29.067 --> 02:31.025
of this attitude.

02:31.026 --> 02:32.486
My attitude?

02:32.487 --> 02:33.945
Have you seen your Instagram?

02:33.946 --> 02:35.614
You got more 'tude

02:35.615 --> 02:37.281
than a girl prepping for prom.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.575
Selfie duck lips?

02:39.576 --> 02:40.952
That is so last year.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.163
- Little old for the hashtags,
- aren't we?

02:43.166 --> 02:45.228
Well, I got one for you.

02:45.229 --> 02:47.292
Hashtag "wannabe."

02:48.502 --> 02:50.004
Or how about hashtag

02:50.005 --> 02:51.504
"egomaniac"?

02:51.505 --> 02:53.090
How about this?

02:53.091 --> 02:54.674
Hashtag "monkey out of here."

02:54.675 --> 02:56.426
- I'll be in my trailer.
- Monty.

02:56.429 --> 02:58.136
Monty. Sorry.

02:58.137 --> 02:59.200
Monty, hey, the reporter

02:59.201 --> 03:00.262

03:00.263 --> 03:01.472

03:05.541 --> 03:06.686

03:06.687 --> 03:08.563
- How's my hair look?
- It's perfect.

03:08.566 --> 03:09.627
But promise me

03:09.628 --> 03:10.690
you will behave.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.713
You are under contract

03:11.714 --> 03:12.733
to say only good things

03:12.734 --> 03:14.235
- about Monkey Up,
- remember?

03:14.238 --> 03:15.529
Sure, Dessy, I'm an actor.

03:15.530 --> 03:16.821
I'll act.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.906
That's what I'm worried about.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.681

03:43.682 --> 03:45.307
Mom, can we buy a monkey?

03:45.308 --> 03:46.622
We can't have wild animals

03:46.623 --> 03:47.935

Yep, I am heading out now.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.943
- I should be in the city
- within the hour.

03:54.946 --> 03:56.320
But, Mom, you said you were

03:56.321 --> 03:57.695

Oh.

Ow.

Okay. Okay.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.805
Okay. Oh, don't forget

04:43.806 --> 04:44.951
to pick Sophie up

04:44.952 --> 04:46.285

- for, like, weeks.

05:12.941 --> 05:14.898
- I so hope I get
- Juliet.

05:14.901 --> 05:16.295
They're gonna pick whoever has

05:16.296 --> 05:17.691
the best chemistry with Romeo.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.485
You'll be great.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.821
Hey, you just moved here

05:20.822 --> 05:22.155
from California, right?

05:22.156 --> 05:23.739
Yeah. I'm Ethan.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.137
We're neighbors.

05:25.138 --> 05:26.533
I'm Taylor.

05:26.534 --> 05:27.743
Yeah.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.329
- Ashley.
- Rebecca.

05:29.332 --> 05:30.871
Hi.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.083
You're auditioning?

05:35.335 --> 05:37.254
Yeah... No.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.549
Uh, yeah.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.593
Good luck with that.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.221
- See you later,
- neighbor.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.936
So the rumors are true, then?

05:53.937 --> 05:56.354
Monty the Monkey can talk.

05:56.355 --> 05:57.837
I think my speaking

05:57.838 --> 05:59.317
speaks for itself, Erin.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.007
Monty, you play an action hero

06:01.008 --> 06:02.695
in the Monkey Up commercials,

06:02.696 --> 06:04.302
but what is Monty like

06:04.303 --> 06:05.906
when he's not on camera?

06:05.907 --> 06:06.929
You know, Erin,

06:06.930 --> 06:07.950
most actors would say

06:07.951 --> 06:09.390
"I'm nothing like the character

06:09.391 --> 06:10.828
I portray on TV."

06:10.829 --> 06:11.914
But the truth is,

06:11.915 --> 06:12.997
I am exactly the character

06:12.998 --> 06:14.333
- I portray
- in the commercials.

06:14.336 --> 06:15.917
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.003
- Just last week, someone put
- black jelly beans in

06:18.006 --> 06:19.421
My jelly bean jar. Nobody likes

06:19.422 --> 06:20.838
the black ones, am I right?

06:20.839 --> 06:22.632
- Well, I...
- Of course I am.

06:22.635 --> 06:24.509
I was about to unleash a can of

06:24.510 --> 06:26.384
monkey kung poo on their butt.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.033
What's that, Jackie Chan? Huh?

06:28.034 --> 06:29.680
I don't think so.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.892
Hyah!

06:33.560 --> 06:34.874
But it turned out to just be

06:34.875 --> 06:36.187
the new craft service girl

06:36.188 --> 06:37.544
replenishing my stash,

06:37.545 --> 06:38.898
so I let her off easy.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.526
You know, I'm compassionate.

06:40.527 --> 06:42.151
Anyway, the point is I'm Method.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.591
I don't do anything on the show

06:43.592 --> 06:45.029
I wouldn't do in real life.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.156
So you do all your own stunts?

06:47.157 --> 06:49.284
- Erin, honey, of course I do
- all my own stunts.

06:49.287 --> 06:50.535
Seriously, would you ask

06:50.536 --> 06:51.785
Tom Cruise that question?

06:51.786 --> 06:53.184
All right, then.

06:53.185 --> 06:54.580
So how does one become

06:54.581 --> 06:56.041
a talking monkey

06:56.042 --> 06:57.499
and the voice of Monkey Up?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.273
Like most of the greats,

06:59.274 --> 07:01.045
I had humble beginnings.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.569
I grew up in the Jersey Zoo

07:02.570 --> 07:04.090
with my mama,

07:04.091 --> 07:05.217
my brothers

07:05.218 --> 07:06.342
Mort and Mooner,

07:06.343 --> 07:07.801
and my sister Melody.

07:07.802 --> 07:08.950
I always suspected

07:08.951 --> 07:10.097
I was adopted.

07:16.811 --> 07:19.251
I longed for something new

07:19.252 --> 07:21.690
and exciting.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.068
So one night, my mama took me

07:23.069 --> 07:24.443
out of the zoo

07:24.444 --> 07:26.071
to go see Shakespeare

07:26.072 --> 07:27.696
in the park.

07:27.697 --> 07:28.989
I didn't know it at the time,

07:28.990 --> 07:30.408
but my life

07:30.409 --> 07:31.826
was about to change.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.996
- But soft...
- I discovered acting.

07:34.999 --> 07:36.310
It was like magic,

07:36.311 --> 07:37.623
and I was hooked.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.209
It is the east,

07:39.210 --> 07:40.793
and Juliet is the sun.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.962
Arise, fair sun,

07:41.963 --> 07:43.129
and kill the envious moon

07:43.130 --> 07:44.465
that is already

07:44.466 --> 07:45.798
sick and pale with grief.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.384
- We went back
- night after night.

07:47.387 --> 07:48.675
Not I.

07:48.676 --> 07:51.178
And I memorized every line.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.388
My parts...

07:52.389 --> 07:54.182
- My title.
- I knew I had the gift.

07:54.185 --> 07:56.748
And my perfect soul shall

07:56.749 --> 07:59.312
manifest me rightly.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.439
And that's how

08:00.440 --> 08:01.563
you learned to talk?

08:01.564 --> 08:03.400
- You know the term
- "monkey see, monkey do"?

08:03.403 --> 08:04.985
Well, no one "monkey sees,

08:04.986 --> 08:06.568
monkey do's" like a monkey.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.446
But then one day,

08:08.447 --> 08:10.697
my life changed forever.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.742
Mama went to the jungle

08:12.743 --> 08:14.785
in the sky.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.329
My mama used to say,

08:16.330 --> 08:17.871
"Follow your dreams,

08:17.872 --> 08:19.228
"become an actor,

08:19.229 --> 08:20.582
but always remember,

08:20.583 --> 08:22.606
fame and fortune come and go,

08:22.607 --> 08:24.628
but family is forever."

08:24.629 --> 08:27.173
Oh, that's very touching.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.925
- I mean, what does that
- even mean, anyway?

08:28.928 --> 08:30.156
I got a bronze star

08:30.157 --> 08:31.385
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.972
Now that's forever.

08:35.222 --> 08:37.224
Anyways, where was I?

08:37.225 --> 08:38.748
Oh, yeah. It was time for me

08:38.749 --> 08:40.269
to exit stage left.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.897
I knew if I didn't get out

08:41.898 --> 08:43.522
of the New Jersey Zoo,

08:43.523 --> 08:45.232
my talent would be wasted.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.901
To be or not to be?

08:46.902 --> 08:48.568
To be or not to be?

08:48.569 --> 08:50.321
That is the question.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.822
That's when I met Dessy.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.408
- He promised
- to help my dream

08:53.411 --> 08:54.785
Of becoming a movie star

08:54.786 --> 08:56.160
come true.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.350
I mean, sure,

08:57.351 --> 08:58.537
it's just commercials now,

08:58.538 --> 08:59.685
but I trust

08:59.686 --> 09:00.831
it'll get better.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.084
Or I'll fire him!

09:02.085 --> 09:03.334
Hmm?

09:03.335 --> 09:05.045
I'm just kidding.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.964
- You know,
- I'm just holding out

09:07.967 --> 09:09.632
- For the right
- movie role, Erin.

09:09.635 --> 09:11.092
Well, in that case,

09:11.093 --> 09:12.551
I assume you're aware

09:12.552 --> 09:14.095
that Cappello's new movie

09:14.096 --> 09:15.637
stars a monkey.

09:15.638 --> 09:16.972
Wait, what? Cappello?

09:16.973 --> 09:18.391
The Angelo Cappello?

09:18.392 --> 09:21.060
Uh, yup. Mm-hmm. The Cappello.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.875
It actually says here Cappello

09:22.876 --> 09:24.688
is using a CG monkey.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.358
- What?
- So why do you think

09:26.361 --> 09:28.442
You were passed over?

09:28.443 --> 09:30.319
Passed over? Please.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.779
This interview is over.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.573
I'm gone.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.492
Dessy! Trailer now!

09:36.493 --> 09:38.577
Monty. Mont...

09:38.578 --> 09:40.476
You are so not getting an invite

09:40.477 --> 09:42.374
to my Oscar party.

09:45.377 --> 09:46.961
Okay, balance beam.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.173
Arms up. Nice.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.557
Nice.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.476
Good.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.448
Okay, that's class.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.034
See you all next week.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.579
How come you didn't know

10:21.580 --> 10:22.662
Cappello's new movie

10:22.663 --> 10:23.914
stars a monkey?

10:23.915 --> 10:25.875
- We've gotta get on it now,
- Dessy.

10:25.878 --> 10:27.126
Get my agent on the phone.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.710
You don't have an agent.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.380
- You got me,
- your trainer.

10:30.383 --> 10:31.673
I don't need a trainer.

10:31.674 --> 10:32.965
I'm already stacked.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.216
Look at this gun show.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.344
Okay, that is very

10:35.345 --> 10:36.469
impressive.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.138
But humans have agents.

10:38.139 --> 10:39.805
You're a monkey, remember?

10:39.806 --> 10:40.953
Lots of famous animals

10:40.954 --> 10:42.099
have agents.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.122
Steven Seagull.

10:43.123 --> 10:44.143
Oh, you mean Seagal?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.708
That's what I said. What about

10:45.709 --> 10:47.271
that guy who married Heidi Klum?

10:47.272 --> 10:49.315
He's not actually a seal.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.567
Okay, Snoop Dogg?

10:50.568 --> 10:51.817
Lil' Bow Wow?

10:51.818 --> 10:54.903
Sheryl Crow? Bee-yoncé?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.572
Michael J. Fox?

10:56.573 --> 10:57.762
Need I go on?

10:57.763 --> 10:58.949
Those are people.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.347
Tiger Woods?

11:00.348 --> 11:01.743
Not an animal.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.954
A human.

11:02.955 --> 11:04.163
Pfft! Come on.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.332
Are you gonna call

11:05.333 --> 11:06.499
Cappello's people or what?

11:06.500 --> 11:07.960
Okay, I already reached out

11:07.961 --> 11:09.418
to Cappello's casting director,

11:09.419 --> 11:11.462
and I quote,

11:11.463 --> 11:14.089
"Cappello is not going to hire

11:14.090 --> 11:15.904
the face of Monkey Up

11:15.905 --> 11:17.717
to star in his next film."

11:17.718 --> 11:19.553
A computer cannot act.

11:19.554 --> 11:20.576
You need to convince him

11:20.577 --> 11:21.597
he needs me.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.912
I'm a trained actor,

11:22.913 --> 11:24.224
thank you very much.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.019
- I've done Shakespeare
- in the park.

11:26.022 --> 11:27.478
You saw Shakespeare in the park.

11:27.479 --> 11:28.835
But that doesn't make you

11:28.836 --> 11:30.189
MacMonkey.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.482
Don't mac-mock me.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.816
With my acting chops,

11:32.817 --> 11:34.735
- obvious good looks
- and natural charisma,

11:34.738 --> 11:36.404
- I'd make the perfect
- movie star.

11:36.407 --> 11:38.406
- Why don't you
- eat your jelly beans,

11:38.409 --> 11:39.991
Chill out in your hammock

11:39.992 --> 11:41.575
and watch The Jungle Book?

11:41.576 --> 11:44.328
No, no, no.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.289
- Come on. What am I
- paying you for?

11:46.292 --> 11:47.789
Hey.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.543
- I've never seen you jog
- in your life.

11:49.546 --> 11:51.503
- Yeah, I'm just getting
- the endorphins going

11:51.506 --> 11:53.254
- So I can have some energy
- to write tonight.

11:53.257 --> 11:55.215
- Why did I quit
- the law firm to be a writer?

11:55.218 --> 11:56.341
Because it's your dream,

11:56.342 --> 11:57.466
and we follow our dreams.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.343
Yes.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.137
- Oh, how was your day?
- Exhausting,

12:01.140 --> 12:02.326
But I think I've got

12:02.327 --> 12:03.514
a handle on it.

12:03.515 --> 12:04.973
So where's Sophie?

12:04.974 --> 12:06.101
I thought you were picking...

12:06.102 --> 12:07.226
I thought you...

12:07.227 --> 12:08.353
Oh, no. Oh!

12:17.778 --> 12:20.072
Oh, so sorry.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.138
I'm so, so, so sorry.

12:22.139 --> 12:24.202
Let's get you home, okay?

12:30.791 --> 12:32.272
Please, honey.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.751
I'm sorry.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.505
It'll never happen again.

12:37.549 --> 12:38.717
What's it gonna take

12:38.718 --> 12:39.884
for you to forgive me?

12:44.847 --> 12:46.328
Hi, Dad.

12:46.329 --> 12:47.807
How's your day?

12:47.808 --> 12:49.894
Fine, I guess.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.063
She took that pretty well.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.150
I just bribed my daughter.

12:55.151 --> 12:57.235
I am a horrible parent.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.413
Oh, I got it.

13:09.414 --> 13:10.686
I'm gonna convince Cappello

13:10.687 --> 13:11.957
to put me in his movie.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.667
Who doesn't love me?

13:13.668 --> 13:15.587
I love me.

13:23.637 --> 13:24.784
Anything?

13:24.785 --> 13:25.930
Uh, one second.

13:27.766 --> 13:28.871
Um, he's not in here.

13:28.872 --> 13:29.976
Ugh!

13:31.394 --> 13:33.271
- Well, you better find him,
- and fast.

13:33.274 --> 13:34.854
I own his tail.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.461
You know, I think I know

13:36.462 --> 13:38.067
where he went.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.273
All right. Shouldn't take long.

13:56.274 --> 13:58.128
Just keep the meter running.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.819
Charge it to Monkey Up.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.508
They'll cover it.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.664
Angelo, my man.

14:11.665 --> 14:13.602
It's great to finally meet you.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.103
Can I call you Angie?

14:15.104 --> 14:17.273
No. Angie's a girl's name.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.367
- I'm Monty
- from the Monkey Up commercials.

14:27.370 --> 14:28.493
Charmed, I'm sure.

14:28.494 --> 14:29.618
How'd you get in here?

14:29.619 --> 14:30.620
Question isn't

14:30.621 --> 14:31.621
how I got here.

14:31.622 --> 14:33.623
It's how lucky you are

14:33.624 --> 14:35.624
to have me in your next movie.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.792
Am I being punked?

14:36.793 --> 14:37.961
Kate!

14:37.962 --> 14:39.127
Yes?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.505
Please don't fire me,

14:40.506 --> 14:41.880
please don't fire me.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.612
Would you please explain how

14:43.613 --> 14:45.342
this monkey got in my office?

14:45.343 --> 14:46.469
Hey, toots.

14:46.470 --> 14:47.594
I don't know, Mr. Cappello.

14:47.595 --> 14:48.617
Angie, Angie,

14:48.618 --> 14:49.638
dream with me.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.328
Picture a monkey on the side

14:51.329 --> 14:53.016
of the Empire State Building.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.352
That's never been done before.

14:54.353 --> 14:55.686
What do you got to lose?

14:55.687 --> 14:57.084
Time, money,

14:57.085 --> 14:58.480
credibility, respect.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.107
- Did I mention
- a third Oscar?

15:00.110 --> 15:01.400
Just let me audition.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.901
Look, this is a movie

15:02.902 --> 15:04.820
about human relationships

15:04.821 --> 15:05.822
and the intricacies

15:05.823 --> 15:06.823
of family.

15:06.824 --> 15:09.241
I saw your interview on ETV.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.077
- You're cocky
- and you're arrogant.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.662
- What?
- You don't know the first thing

15:12.665 --> 15:13.851
About family

15:13.852 --> 15:15.038
or being selfless.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.498
Selfie?

15:16.499 --> 15:18.459
I'm Mr. Selfie.

15:19.544 --> 15:20.587
You gonna retweet that?

15:20.588 --> 15:21.628
You could.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.297
- Just hashtag
- "Monty the Monkey."

15:23.300 --> 15:24.882
The answer is no.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.760
- I'm going CG.
- Computer-generated.

15:26.763 --> 15:28.637
But computers can't act.

15:28.638 --> 15:30.512
I'm Shakespearean-trained.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.223
- Kate.
- Yes?

15:32.226 --> 15:33.266
Please escort this monkey

15:33.267 --> 15:34.307
out of my office.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.477
- You are making a big mistake,
- fella.

15:36.480 --> 15:37.604
Huge! You know what?

15:37.605 --> 15:38.729
I'm not gonna beg.

15:38.730 --> 15:39.731
You'll come crawling

15:39.732 --> 15:40.732
back to me.

15:40.733 --> 15:42.316
He's just so cute.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.447
Monty, we need

15:47.448 --> 15:48.947
to talk this out.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.346
Frankly, my dear Dessy,

15:50.347 --> 15:51.742
I don't give a darn.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.015
I am not going back

15:53.016 --> 15:54.287
to commercials.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.542
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:59.543 --> 16:00.584
Stop, stop, stop.

16:00.585 --> 16:01.941
I need to commandeer

16:01.942 --> 16:03.295
your skateboard.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.714
Hasta la vista, Dessy.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.591
Monty, that's a $400 phone!

16:07.592 --> 16:09.342
Stop that monkey!

16:09.343 --> 16:11.262
Monty!

16:12.221 --> 16:13.264
Whoo!

16:13.265 --> 16:14.307
Monty!

16:16.643 --> 16:17.831
Monty!

16:17.832 --> 16:19.018
Whoo!

16:19.019 --> 16:20.855
- Monty!
- You're not thinking straight.

16:20.858 --> 16:22.523
Come back here!

16:23.733 --> 16:25.525
Watch where you're going!

16:25.526 --> 16:27.153
- Look out.
- Coming through.

16:27.156 --> 16:28.947
Move it, lady!

16:37.705 --> 16:39.749
Whoo! Watch out.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.838
- They say I don't do
- my own stunts.

16:44.841 --> 16:46.547
Sorry.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.342
Monty!

16:49.343 --> 16:50.593
Ha-ha!

16:54.263 --> 16:56.056
Where is he? Where is he?

17:01.312 --> 17:03.106
That is it! I have had it

17:03.107 --> 17:04.897
with that banana tree hugger.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.630
There has got to be another

17:06.631 --> 17:08.359
monkey of equal intelligence

17:08.361 --> 17:10.320
- without attitude.
- Now, find it.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.665
See you tomorrow, Phil.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.082
Good night, Mrs. Andrews.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.544
- Drive safe
- in the storm.

17:24.547 --> 17:25.941
Oh, I will, thanks. Oh...

17:25.942 --> 17:27.337
Very good.

17:27.338 --> 17:28.694
I gotta get inside.

17:28.695 --> 17:30.048
It's a jungle out here.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.530
Could you have that dollhouse

17:31.531 --> 17:33.010
delivered to my house tonight?

17:33.011 --> 17:34.345
- I made a deal
- with my daughter.

17:34.348 --> 17:35.889
- Oh, well,
- of course, ma'am.

17:35.892 --> 17:36.911
I'll personally

17:36.912 --> 17:37.931
attend to it myself.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.183
- Thank you.
- Have a good night.

17:39.186 --> 17:40.685
You're welcome.

17:40.686 --> 17:42.186
Good night.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.733
Whoa.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.277
What is this place?

17:49.278 --> 17:50.819
A taxidermist?

17:50.820 --> 17:52.739
- They have to keep it so dark
- in here?

17:52.742 --> 17:53.844
How's a guy supposed

17:53.845 --> 17:54.948
to find his way around?

17:54.949 --> 17:57.617
Whoa, what was that?

17:57.618 --> 17:59.662
I gotta hide.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.551
There's the dollhouse

18:13.552 --> 18:15.260
Mrs. Andrews wanted.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.929
Whoa!

18:16.930 --> 18:18.305
Hold!

18:27.648 --> 18:28.982
Who do you work for, huh?

18:28.983 --> 18:30.735
- What are you doing
- down there?

18:30.738 --> 18:32.862
Gesundheit.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.326
Stop staring at me.

18:40.327 --> 18:43.205
Okay, let's get out of here.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.877
Whew. That was close.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.596
Oh, oh, this looks like

18:58.597 --> 18:59.973
a better hiding spot.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.114
It ain't the Ritz,

19:17.115 --> 19:18.532
but it'll have to do.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.662
Okay.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.039
This is the house

19:25.040 --> 19:26.414
that Mrs. Andrews

19:26.415 --> 19:28.626
- wants delivered to her place
- in Jersey tonight.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.087
I wanna thank the Academy.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.048
- I'll go get
- the coffee and, you know,

19:34.051 --> 19:35.216
Badda-bing, badda-boom,

19:35.217 --> 19:36.382
let's work as a team.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.198
Good luck.

19:38.199 --> 19:40.013
Don't break anything.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.374
Wow.

20:25.641 --> 20:28.060
Huh? Where am I?

20:28.061 --> 20:29.187
Yes! They got me

20:29.188 --> 20:30.312
a pet monkey!

20:32.023 --> 20:33.483
Whoa and whoa,

20:33.484 --> 20:34.941
I am nobody's pet.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.402
I'm a free agent.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.303
No way. Aren't you Monty

20:41.304 --> 20:42.866
from Monkey Up?

20:42.867 --> 20:44.515
In the flesh and fur.

20:44.516 --> 20:46.161
You want an autograph?

20:46.162 --> 20:48.122
- Why are you wearing
- an elf costume?

20:48.125 --> 20:49.394
Long story, kid.

20:49.395 --> 20:50.665
I'm doing research for a movie.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.543
- You know,
- getting into character.

20:52.546 --> 20:53.649
What movie?

20:53.650 --> 20:54.753
Well, I don't exactly

20:54.754 --> 20:56.088
have a deal done yet.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.882
- My people are talking
- with their people,

20:57.885 --> 20:59.029
So I can't talk about it,

20:59.030 --> 21:00.175
you know what I'm saying?

21:00.176 --> 21:01.740
Okay, it's a movie starring

21:01.741 --> 21:03.302
me, myself and I. Enough said.

21:03.303 --> 21:04.764
Wait right here.

21:04.765 --> 21:06.223
I'll be back.

21:06.224 --> 21:07.580
Wait a second, kid.

21:07.581 --> 21:08.934
You didn't tell me where I am.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.541
I gotta get out of here.

21:10.542 --> 21:12.146
I am wasting valuable time.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.779
- Good morning,
- sweetie.

21:19.782 --> 21:21.176
What are you doing?

21:21.177 --> 21:22.572
I am equally distributing

21:22.573 --> 21:23.762
the blood between

21:23.763 --> 21:24.951
both hemispheres of my brain.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.498
They put their selfies

21:30.499 --> 21:31.790
on a wall?

21:31.791 --> 21:33.793
Hashtag "weirdoes."

21:38.047 --> 21:39.840
- You look like you're going
- to explode.

21:39.843 --> 21:41.321
Explode with ideas

21:41.322 --> 21:42.801
for plot and characters,

21:42.802 --> 21:44.261
if that's what you mean.

21:44.262 --> 21:45.597
Can I have a monkey?

21:45.598 --> 21:46.931
We just got you a dollhouse.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.266
Ask Mom.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.185
- I asked Mom if we could
- buy a monkey.

21:51.188 --> 21:52.374
I'm asking you

21:52.375 --> 21:53.561
if I can have one.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.168
Wow, I guess I'm not the only

21:55.169 --> 21:56.774
lawyer in the family, huh?

22:02.362 --> 22:04.615
Why don't we ask the judge when

22:04.616 --> 22:06.867
she gets home from work, okay?

22:19.421 --> 22:21.214
Whoa, who are you, pal?

22:21.215 --> 22:23.009
- What, are you talking to me?
- Yeah, you.

22:23.012 --> 22:24.718
- Monkey boy
- with the little hat.

22:24.721 --> 22:26.512
- I'm sorry,
- who are you?

22:26.515 --> 22:28.554
I'm with the neighborhood watch.

22:28.555 --> 22:29.952
Did you jack that banana

22:29.953 --> 22:31.348
from the Andrews' house?

22:31.349 --> 22:32.558
Don't you lie to me.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.520
- Oh, please.
- I borrowed it.

22:34.523 --> 22:35.895
Now get out of my grill

22:35.896 --> 22:38.107
- before I go all monkey kung poo
- on your butt.

22:38.110 --> 22:39.440
Oh!

22:39.441 --> 22:41.193
Gotta go.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.652
Now you're threatening me?

22:42.653 --> 22:44.570
Yeah, that's not good.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.156
Ooh, I'm shaking

22:46.157 --> 22:47.740
in my paws.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.097
Rabid dog!

22:49.098 --> 22:50.452
Somebody call the cops!

22:51.871 --> 22:53.121
I'm out of here!

22:53.122 --> 22:54.561
Tucker, stop!

22:54.562 --> 22:55.999
Go away, Tucker!

22:56.000 --> 22:57.773
Cut! Cut! Call in my stunt

22:57.774 --> 22:59.545
double, like now.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.598
Watch it.

23:10.599 --> 23:11.890
This tail is precious.

23:11.891 --> 23:12.955
Yeow!

23:12.956 --> 23:14.018
Let go, Tucker.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.362
Monty, are you okay?

23:25.363 --> 23:26.531
Is there blood?

23:26.532 --> 23:27.697
I don't do blood.

23:27.698 --> 23:29.575
Especially my own. Oh!

23:45.132 --> 23:46.717
- Where am I?
- What's happening?

23:46.720 --> 23:48.301
Am I gonna make it, doc?

23:48.302 --> 23:50.179
The prognosis is good.

23:50.180 --> 23:52.055
It's just a scratch.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.598
Sophie, time for school.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.392
I have to go to school.

23:55.393 --> 23:56.498
Rest now.

23:56.499 --> 23:57.603
Doctor's orders.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.253
Just show me the monkey.

24:01.254 --> 24:02.565
It's over here. Here. See?

24:02.566 --> 24:03.816
Ah.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.235
Huh?

24:05.236 --> 24:06.652
This is where Monty's from.

24:06.653 --> 24:08.613
They look just like him.

24:08.614 --> 24:11.721
Yeah. Hey, little guy.

24:11.722 --> 24:14.828
Can you say, "Monkey Up"?

24:16.414 --> 24:17.789
Oh, no, that is rude.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.584
Oh! Ah!

24:27.133 --> 24:29.509
Hey! He took my wallet!

24:42.231 --> 24:43.356
Oh, a head shot.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.067
- Got you right
- in the kisser.

24:45.070 --> 24:46.986
What is that?

24:49.280 --> 24:50.905
It smells like...

24:50.906 --> 24:52.490
poo.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.002
Monkey poo,

25:03.003 --> 25:04.585
to be precise.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.130
- It just means
- that they like you.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.185
See you tomorrow. Okay, bye-bye.

25:35.117 --> 25:36.765
So how about him, huh?

25:36.766 --> 25:38.411
It's animatronic.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.163
Can it do what Monty did?

25:40.164 --> 25:41.915
Watch this.

25:43.501 --> 25:44.834
Oh... wow.

25:44.835 --> 25:46.462
- Fire on the set!
- That's not...

25:46.465 --> 25:48.713
That's not...

25:48.714 --> 25:50.298
That's normal.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.946
That's normal.

25:51.947 --> 25:53.593
That's supposed to happen.

25:55.595 --> 25:56.743
Hey, kid,

25:56.744 --> 25:57.889
I notice you got a family.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.308
Yeah. I have a mom, a dad,

25:59.309 --> 26:00.725
and my brother Ethan.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.187
- You know, maybe I could hole up
- here for a bit

26:03.190 --> 26:04.687
And learn about families.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.022
It's a little suburban,

26:06.023 --> 26:07.483
- but, I mean,
- I'll get used to it.

26:07.486 --> 26:08.774
How much to rent the house out

26:08.775 --> 26:10.236
- for, like,
- a couple weeks?

26:10.239 --> 26:11.778
I don't know.

26:13.364 --> 26:14.740
Give me a number.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.115
Ten dollars?

26:16.116 --> 26:17.472
Well, you drive

26:17.473 --> 26:18.826
a hard bargain, kid. Hmm.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.412
Just one problem: I don't quite

26:20.413 --> 26:21.996
have my wallet on me.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.916
- You could pay me
- another way.

26:23.919 --> 26:25.230
How's that?

26:25.231 --> 26:26.543
You're a brave action star.

26:26.544 --> 26:28.002
Very brave, actually.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.421
That movie Brave?

26:29.422 --> 26:30.838
Loosely based on my life.

26:30.839 --> 26:31.924
Then you can help me

26:31.925 --> 26:33.007
with my gymnastics.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.239
Yeah, sure.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.468
You got a deal.

26:35.469 --> 26:36.970
Seal it with a high five.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.289
I guess we're gonna stick

26:42.290 --> 26:43.309
with the gold, I think.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.833
I like the direction

26:44.834 --> 26:46.354
you're going with, Clare.

26:46.355 --> 26:49.315
Good. Oh, great.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.359
Do you want to get that?

26:51.360 --> 26:52.674
No, no, no, Mr. Hartz.

26:52.675 --> 26:53.986
It's okay. Thanks.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.343
Let me show you the Christmas

26:55.344 --> 26:56.698
trees we were thinking about.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.017
No Netflix? What am I gonna do

27:02.018 --> 27:03.246
all day?

27:03.247 --> 27:04.957
Come on, let's tuck you in.

27:07.543 --> 27:08.918
Up we go.

27:08.919 --> 27:11.796
In we go.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.466
Dad, can you please tell Sophie

27:13.467 --> 27:15.133
to stay out of my room

27:15.134 --> 27:17.093
and stop eating my jelly beans?

27:17.094 --> 27:18.200
Soph, stay out

27:18.201 --> 27:19.304
of his room.

27:19.305 --> 27:23.267
But I didn't. I swear.

27:31.942 --> 27:33.444
We need to lose the brother.

27:33.445 --> 27:34.944
That kid is a drag and a half.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.905
Lose him? We can't, silly.

27:36.906 --> 27:38.864
He's a part of our family.

27:38.865 --> 27:40.013
Mom says he just gets

27:40.014 --> 27:41.159
a little grumpy sometimes

27:41.160 --> 27:42.995
- because he's almost
- a teenager.

27:42.998 --> 27:44.080
You'll love him

27:44.081 --> 27:45.163
once you get to know him.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.957
- Well, you know what they say,
- kid.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.542
Keep your friends close,

27:48.543 --> 27:50.126
but your family closer.

27:50.127 --> 27:51.877
Good night, Monty.

27:51.878 --> 27:53.255
Good night, kid.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.224
What? No water?

28:03.225 --> 28:04.641
What's next?

28:04.642 --> 28:05.810
I will be insisting

28:05.811 --> 28:06.977
on a rent reduction.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.402
Whoa. Now, that's

28:15.403 --> 28:16.986
a soaker tub.

28:16.987 --> 28:18.280
I am going in,

28:18.281 --> 28:19.573
full Monty.

28:25.996 --> 28:27.746
Yeah, things are okay, Mom.

28:27.747 --> 28:29.375
- They're just
- really hectic.

28:29.378 --> 28:30.501
All right,

28:30.502 --> 28:31.627
this monkey is going under.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.945
Sophie's adjusting, but I don't

28:36.946 --> 28:38.550
even have enough time

28:38.551 --> 28:40.386
- to teach my daughter
- how to do a cartwheel.

28:40.389 --> 28:41.679
No, Ethan's not making

28:41.680 --> 28:42.970
any friends.

28:42.971 --> 28:44.138
Awkward.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.161
I know,

28:45.162 --> 28:46.182
it's not like his mom

28:46.183 --> 28:48.519
- can really help him with that,
- you know?

28:48.522 --> 28:50.687
Yeah.

28:50.688 --> 28:52.146
Yeah, I don't know.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.211
It's always been

28:53.212 --> 28:54.273
Jim's dream to write.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.067
I thought...

28:56.068 --> 28:59.363
Hey! Okay, breathe. Ow!

29:00.822 --> 29:02.741
- Oh, I know.
- Whoa, whoa!

29:02.744 --> 29:04.158
Oh!

29:04.159 --> 29:05.536
- I felt this move
- to New Jersey

29:05.539 --> 29:07.538
- Would be the best thing
- for everybody.

29:07.541 --> 29:10.790
Okay. Yeah.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.463
Yeah, I know, Mom.

29:16.464 --> 29:18.756
Thanks.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.238
Sheesh. Can't a fella

29:20.239 --> 29:21.719
get a little privacy?

29:31.353 --> 29:32.876
And then we'll shoot

29:32.877 --> 29:34.397
in Africa.

29:34.398 --> 29:36.775
What's that sound?

29:54.834 --> 29:56.315
"Terrance takes off his suit

29:56.316 --> 29:57.795
jacket and rolls up his sleeves

29:57.796 --> 29:59.590
- "while staring
- at the defendant's eyes.

29:59.593 --> 30:00.946
He means business, begins his

30:00.947 --> 30:02.300
closing arguments to the jury."

30:02.301 --> 30:03.884
Ugh, snooze-fest.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.387
I'd be napping too

30:05.388 --> 30:06.888
if I was writing this garbage.

30:08.848 --> 30:11.038
Let's see. Wizards, done.

30:11.039 --> 30:13.227
Vampires, overdone.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.397
- Well, you know what they say,
- write what you know.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.732
Oh, I got it. Monkeys.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.591
You still got it, Jimbo.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.594
All right, kid.

30:45.595 --> 30:46.803
Can you go first?

30:46.804 --> 30:48.243
Who, me? Up there?

30:48.244 --> 30:49.681
No, no gymnastics.

30:49.682 --> 30:50.704
I can't get hurt

30:50.705 --> 30:51.724
before my audition

30:51.725 --> 30:54.101
'cause I'm an action hero.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.729
- Well, what do you
- think about

30:55.732 --> 30:56.813
Before you jump off

30:56.814 --> 30:57.896
something high?

30:57.897 --> 30:59.357
How my hair looks.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.359
But in your case,

31:00.360 --> 31:01.360
I wouldn't look down.

31:01.361 --> 31:02.549
Just focus on a point

31:02.550 --> 31:03.736
in the distance.

31:03.737 --> 31:05.238
That's all you gotta do.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.753
All right, kid, you're doing

31:19.754 --> 31:21.629
great. Look at this!

31:21.630 --> 31:23.382
All right, focus, focus.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.973
- All right.
- Good first try, kid.

31:31.976 --> 31:34.059
- The good news is
- there's nowhere to go but up.

31:37.145 --> 31:40.294
"But soft, what light through

31:40.295 --> 31:43.442
yonder window breaks?

31:43.443 --> 31:45.528
"It is the east,

31:45.529 --> 31:47.613
and Juliet is the sun."

31:47.614 --> 31:49.074
Oh, that is it.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.533
Enough is enough.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.493
No, no, no!

31:52.494 --> 31:54.308
You read Shakespeare

31:54.309 --> 31:56.121
like you're reading a cookbook.

31:56.122 --> 31:58.041
Shakespeare deserves power,

31:58.042 --> 31:59.958
passion and fortitude.

31:59.959 --> 32:01.565
You're butchering his words as

32:01.566 --> 32:03.171
if they were a Christmas turkey.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.926
Oh, I'm Monty, by the way.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.449
I'm renting the dollhouse

32:10.450 --> 32:11.970
that's inside your house.

32:11.971 --> 32:14.973
Monty? From Monkey Up?

32:14.974 --> 32:17.101
What's on your face?

32:17.102 --> 32:19.438
It's avocado, banana, cucumber.

32:19.439 --> 32:21.773
Does wonders for the pores.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.421
Look, I know it's not every day

32:23.422 --> 32:25.067
a celebrity stays in your house,

32:25.068 --> 32:26.402
but while I'm here,

32:26.403 --> 32:28.195
I refuse to listen to you

32:28.196 --> 32:29.907
- make a mockery
- of Shakespeare.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.371
Well, don't give up

32:35.372 --> 32:36.621
on yourself that easily.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.144
I just gotta know,

32:38.145 --> 32:39.665
what's the motivation here?

32:39.666 --> 32:40.667
Why do you wanna learn

32:40.668 --> 32:41.668
Shakespeare, kid?

32:41.669 --> 32:44.587
Well, there's this girl,

32:44.588 --> 32:46.194
and she's going out

32:46.195 --> 32:47.799
for Juliet.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.760
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
- let me stop you right there.

32:49.763 --> 32:51.470
You're doing this

32:51.471 --> 32:53.178
for a girl?

32:53.179 --> 32:55.181
That is an excellent reason

32:55.182 --> 32:57.182
to learn Shakespeare.

32:57.183 --> 32:58.434
The ladies eat it up.

32:58.435 --> 33:00.019
- Listen, I can help you
- with that.

33:00.022 --> 33:01.687
Really?

33:01.688 --> 33:03.336
But it's gonna cost you,

33:03.337 --> 33:04.982
in jelly beans.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.233
Just no black ones.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.944
So you're the one

33:07.945 --> 33:09.738
- who's been eating
- my jelly beans.

33:09.741 --> 33:11.385
I won't confirm

33:11.386 --> 33:13.031
or deny that.

33:13.032 --> 33:14.660
Do we have ourselves a deal?

33:16.745 --> 33:18.664
Seal it with a fist bump.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.373
Whew.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.813
Hello. Whoo!

33:22.814 --> 33:24.251
Whoa!

33:24.252 --> 33:25.795
You're smiling.

33:25.796 --> 33:27.840
- That means you made progress
- on your manuscript?

33:27.843 --> 33:29.299
- I did. I must've been
- in the zone,

33:29.302 --> 33:30.968
- Because I don't remember
- writing it.

33:30.971 --> 33:32.259
Ooh, the courtroom caper?

33:32.260 --> 33:33.929
- The drama? It's totally
- different now.

33:33.932 --> 33:35.306
Now it is the story

33:35.307 --> 33:36.681
of a monkey.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.079
I know it sounds so random,

33:38.080 --> 33:39.475
but it's so high-concept.

33:39.476 --> 33:40.999
It's crazy. I can feel the story

33:41.000 --> 33:42.520
being channeled through me.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.793
It needs work, of course, but I

33:43.794 --> 33:45.063
can feel the creative juices

33:45.064 --> 33:46.170
moving around

33:46.171 --> 33:47.274
inside my body.

33:47.275 --> 33:48.694
- So quick jog,
- then I'm back at it.

33:48.697 --> 33:50.445
Okay. No, no, no.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.618
Oh, my God.

33:59.496 --> 34:02.414
Steady, steady.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.543
Oh, no.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.920
I did it, Monty.

34:07.921 --> 34:09.589
You sure did, kid.

34:16.763 --> 34:19.014
Romeo, Romeo!

34:19.016 --> 34:21.266
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

34:21.266 --> 34:23.248
Shall I hear more,

34:23.250 --> 34:25.228
or shall I speak at this?

34:25.230 --> 34:26.585
Yeah, you laugh, but you're

34:26.587 --> 34:27.940
wearing this next, pal.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.005
What's my motivation?

34:30.007 --> 34:32.070
Oh, yeah, bananas.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.782
Hi. Oh!

34:36.909 --> 34:39.201
Here you go.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.786
It's perfect.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.205
Doesn't anybody read

34:42.206 --> 34:43.621
the ingredients to this stuff?

34:43.623 --> 34:45.062
I mean,

34:45.063 --> 34:46.501
it'll rot your brain.

34:53.216 --> 34:54.760
Okay, arms straight.

35:14.071 --> 35:15.990
As you can see,

35:15.991 --> 35:17.907
bananas are nature's superfood.

35:17.908 --> 35:19.451
Now, this is what they should be

35:19.452 --> 35:20.994
putting in those energy drinks.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.223
Looks like it's gonna

35:41.224 --> 35:42.390
be a cheat day.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.451
Bon appétit.

36:02.452 --> 36:03.787
"Let's kill the moon,

36:03.788 --> 36:05.122
for it is...."

36:07.624 --> 36:09.166
Oh, my gosh.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.189
I'm not gonna get it

36:10.190 --> 36:11.209
in time.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.504
I think you may be right, kid.

36:12.505 --> 36:13.796
You and Shakespeare go together

36:13.797 --> 36:14.986
like plaid and stripes,

36:14.987 --> 36:16.173
kittens and water,

36:16.174 --> 36:17.572
sea lions

36:17.573 --> 36:18.968
and great white sharks.

36:18.969 --> 36:20.616
Oh, I got it. You ever hear

36:20.617 --> 36:22.262
of Cyrano de Bergerac?

36:22.263 --> 36:24.306
Shakespeare's cousin, right?

36:24.307 --> 36:25.599
Yup, you nailed it.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.268
- Really?
- No!

36:27.271 --> 36:29.020
He was a French man with

36:29.021 --> 36:30.771
an agile tongue and a huge nose.

36:30.772 --> 36:31.857
I'm talking like

36:31.858 --> 36:32.940
Dumbo's ears huge.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.526
People would come from all over

36:34.527 --> 36:36.110
just to see his schnozzer.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.237
Anyway, he used his way

36:37.238 --> 36:38.362
with words

36:38.363 --> 36:40.073
- to help this guy
- get a girl.

36:40.076 --> 36:41.345
And I will do the same for you,

36:41.346 --> 36:42.616
except in this version,

36:42.617 --> 36:43.973
Cyrano will be really,

36:43.974 --> 36:45.327
really handsome.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.080
- Some have compared him
- to Clooney.

36:47.083 --> 36:50.167
Okay. How?

36:51.292 --> 36:53.293
Here.

36:53.294 --> 36:54.671
Put these on.

36:56.631 --> 36:57.883
I'll call you.

36:57.884 --> 36:59.133
What's your number?

36:59.134 --> 37:00.592
I got a sonographic memory.

37:00.593 --> 37:03.095
555-6789.

37:03.096 --> 37:04.848
- Okay, got it.
- Now, you are either

37:04.851 --> 37:06.057
Gonna listen to me and have

37:06.058 --> 37:07.265
half a chance at surviving,

37:07.266 --> 37:08.747
or you'll be the one

37:08.748 --> 37:10.227
that looks like a monkey.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.292
I can't believe

37:11.293 --> 37:12.354
I just said that.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.003
Would through the airy region

37:14.004 --> 37:15.649
stream so bright

37:15.650 --> 37:17.152
that the birds would sing

37:17.153 --> 37:18.652
and think it were not night.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.155
This'll do nicely.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.823
Well done, sir.

37:22.824 --> 37:24.743
Well done.

37:26.078 --> 37:27.452
Tough to beat that one.

37:27.453 --> 37:32.167
Next up, Ethan Andrews.

37:33.168 --> 37:37.546
Ethan Andrews?

37:37.547 --> 37:40.341
Oh, thank you for making it.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.681
Yeah.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.977
Monty, where are you?

37:51.978 --> 37:54.064
Whenever you're ready, Ethan.

37:58.235 --> 37:59.401
Where have you been?

37:59.402 --> 38:00.508
Look to your left.

38:00.509 --> 38:01.613
I can see you.

38:09.162 --> 38:10.580
But soft, what light...

38:10.581 --> 38:11.997
But soft, what light...

38:11.998 --> 38:13.896
through yonder window breaks?

38:13.897 --> 38:15.793
Through yonder window breaks?

38:15.794 --> 38:17.525
It is the east...

38:17.526 --> 38:19.255
It is the east...

38:19.256 --> 38:20.673
- Okay, get down
- on one knee

38:20.676 --> 38:22.174
And look Taylor in the eye.

38:22.175 --> 38:24.344
And Juliet is the sun.

38:24.345 --> 38:26.511
And Juliet is the sun.

38:26.512 --> 38:28.639
Arise, fair sun,

38:28.640 --> 38:32.144
and kill the envious moon.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.731
Bravo.

38:40.193 --> 38:41.298
You did it, kid,

38:41.299 --> 38:42.402
all right!

38:42.403 --> 38:43.947
Bravissimo!

38:46.449 --> 38:48.243
Okay, so I think I got the

38:48.244 --> 38:50.036
solution to all our problems.

38:55.374 --> 38:56.626
Show me.

38:59.045 --> 39:02.923
Hey, everybody. It's me, Monty.

39:02.924 --> 39:05.135
Drink Monkey Up

39:05.136 --> 39:07.345
and go bananas.

39:13.810 --> 39:15.270
Oh, that's not...

39:19.565 --> 39:21.150
We need Monty back.

39:21.151 --> 39:23.069
It's...

39:29.951 --> 39:32.037
Oh, jeez, another family crisis.

39:32.038 --> 39:34.122
Monty to the rescue.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.293
You stuck?

39:39.294 --> 39:41.171
- I hate to see you
- struggle.

39:41.174 --> 39:44.506
Monty? Is that really you?

39:44.507 --> 39:45.592
Well, we had to meet

39:45.593 --> 39:46.675
sooner or later,

39:46.676 --> 39:48.594
- especially if I'm gonna star
- in your movie.

39:50.555 --> 39:51.805
Oh...

39:51.806 --> 39:53.287
Oh, my goodness.

39:53.288 --> 39:54.766
I've done it.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.290
The stress of being a lawyer

39:56.291 --> 39:57.811
made me go nuts.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.064
And then I became a writer

39:59.065 --> 40:00.314
and I really blew a gasket.

40:00.315 --> 40:02.900
He's losing it.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.610
- Snap out of it!
- There's only room

40:04.613 --> 40:05.945
For one dramatic actor

40:05.946 --> 40:07.279
in this house.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.469
It's probably all that junk

40:08.470 --> 40:09.656
you're drinking.

40:09.657 --> 40:10.721
Do you even know

40:10.722 --> 40:11.783
what's in Monkey Up?

40:11.784 --> 40:12.994
No.

40:12.995 --> 40:14.203
I'm Monty.

40:14.204 --> 40:15.434
It's a long story involving

40:15.435 --> 40:16.663
being raised in a zoo.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.374
Just like my story.

40:18.375 --> 40:20.085
- Actually,
- it's our story.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.798
I may have embellished a little.

40:26.799 --> 40:28.051
You know,

40:28.052 --> 40:29.301
"based on a true story" stuff.

40:29.302 --> 40:30.677
Like a memoir?

40:30.678 --> 40:32.429
Hmm, of sorts.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.286
The lead monkey is wanting

40:34.287 --> 40:36.141
acceptance among his peers.

40:36.142 --> 40:37.519
To be recognized

40:37.520 --> 40:38.894
for his superior talent,

40:38.895 --> 40:41.002
gain fame, fortune

40:41.003 --> 40:43.107
and celebrity status.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.691
It's a universal tale.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.402
Right. Makes sense.

40:46.403 --> 40:48.176
I figured if I want a juicy lead

40:48.177 --> 40:49.947
role in a movie,

40:49.948 --> 40:51.533
I can't just sit around

40:51.534 --> 40:53.117
and wait for that to be written.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.265
So I took matters

40:54.266 --> 40:55.411
into my own hands.

40:55.412 --> 40:57.059
Okay, maybe I am like

40:57.060 --> 40:58.706
Hemingway.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.459
I'm just gonna go with it.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.420
So then I figured

41:04.421 --> 41:06.589
- the dad has to take
- the kids Christmas shopping.

41:06.592 --> 41:07.798
Yes, that's great!

41:07.799 --> 41:09.217
- And we can have
- the mom character

41:09.220 --> 41:10.843
- Come back in at the end
- of the story.

41:10.846 --> 41:12.387
Honey?

41:16.099 --> 41:18.206
Where did you get that jacket?

41:18.207 --> 41:20.311
You look like Hugh Hefner.

41:20.312 --> 41:22.168
Oh, this old thing?

41:22.169 --> 41:24.022
This is what we writers wear.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.796
I thought you had a business

41:25.797 --> 41:27.567
dinner with Mr. Hartz tonight.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.195
Oh, I do. I came home to change.

41:29.196 --> 41:30.822
Have you been writing all day?

41:32.407 --> 41:35.284
Yes.

41:35.285 --> 41:37.953
What is that on your desk?

41:37.954 --> 41:40.331
Uh, that is a monkey.

41:40.332 --> 41:41.646
I use it for inspiration,

41:41.647 --> 41:42.958
you know, for my story.

41:42.959 --> 41:44.732
The one I told you about.

41:44.733 --> 41:46.503
Oh, it is so lifelike.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.506
- We could sell a ton of those
- at the store.

41:48.509 --> 41:49.611
Oh, and we should get one

41:49.612 --> 41:50.715
for Sophie for Christmas.

41:50.716 --> 41:52.760
- She is always going on
- about wanting a pet monkey.

41:52.763 --> 41:54.928
Where did you get it?

41:54.929 --> 41:56.556
Uh, I was jogging

41:56.557 --> 41:58.182
near a garbage can.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.497
And can you believe someone was

41:59.498 --> 42:00.809
gonna throw this stuffy away?

42:00.810 --> 42:01.957
Wow. Well, we can use it

42:01.958 --> 42:03.103
as a prototype.

42:03.104 --> 42:04.562
It is a little chubby.

42:04.563 --> 42:05.836
Kind of like the Pillsbury

42:05.837 --> 42:07.108
Doughboy.

42:08.067 --> 42:10.444
But we can slim it down.

42:10.445 --> 42:11.529
Can I borrow it?

42:11.530 --> 42:12.612
No! No!

42:12.613 --> 42:14.053
I need it. You know,

42:14.054 --> 42:15.491
when I'm at a loss of ideas,

42:15.492 --> 42:16.952
I cuddle it like a teddy bear.

42:16.953 --> 42:18.410
So cute and cuddly.

42:18.411 --> 42:19.475
Seriously?

42:19.476 --> 42:20.537
Like hey, look.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.206
Whoo! Swinging monkey.

42:22.207 --> 42:23.834
Giving me ideas all day long.

42:23.835 --> 42:25.459
Whoo! Check it out.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.086
Whoo!

42:32.800 --> 42:34.676
Oops.

42:34.677 --> 42:36.471
- I'll just pick up
- the monkey.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.306
Okay, honey.

42:39.307 --> 42:40.830
I won't take your

42:40.831 --> 42:42.351
stuffed monkey away from you.

42:42.352 --> 42:44.145
- You know, maybe you should
- get some sleep.

42:44.148 --> 42:45.668
You've been writing all day.

42:45.669 --> 42:47.189
No, no, no, I am crushing it.

42:47.190 --> 42:49.401
- If I keep going at this pace,
- I'm gonna have a draft

42:49.404 --> 42:50.673
To my publishers by Thursday.

42:50.674 --> 42:51.944
Okay.

42:54.864 --> 42:56.656
Oh, okay. Okay.

42:56.657 --> 42:58.659
All right.

43:03.789 --> 43:05.145
So wanna tell me

43:05.146 --> 43:06.500
what that was all about?

43:06.501 --> 43:08.420
- I couldn't tell her.
- She'd think I was crazy.

43:08.423 --> 43:10.004
- Not until
- we're finished.

43:10.007 --> 43:11.506
- By the way,
- what's the ending?

43:11.509 --> 43:12.549
Good question.

43:12.550 --> 43:13.590
It hasn't happened yet,

43:13.591 --> 43:15.926
so over to you, Jimbo.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.262
Just remember,

43:17.263 --> 43:18.596
everybody loves a happy ending.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.562
Why don't we split up and we'll

43:25.563 --> 43:27.187
find the best tree ever, okay?

43:27.188 --> 43:28.606
- Christmas!
- Okay, yeah.

43:28.609 --> 43:30.004
I'll be right back.

43:30.005 --> 43:31.401
See you in a bit.

43:32.402 --> 43:35.028
Taylor, what are you doing here?

43:35.029 --> 43:36.343
I'm here with my mom.

43:36.344 --> 43:37.655
We're buying a Christmas tree.

43:37.656 --> 43:39.012
Oh, right.

43:39.013 --> 43:40.367
Makes sense.

43:40.368 --> 43:41.849
This is it, the moment

43:41.850 --> 43:43.328
you've been waiting for.

43:43.329 --> 43:45.247
Ask her to the party.

43:45.248 --> 43:46.437
My mom's big Christmas

43:46.438 --> 43:47.624
charity gala

43:47.625 --> 43:48.856
for Hartz Toyz is on Saturday

43:48.857 --> 43:50.085
in the city.

43:50.086 --> 43:51.837
Oh, cool.

43:54.257 --> 43:55.840
Ask her to come, dummy.

43:55.841 --> 43:57.135
Uh, do you want

43:57.136 --> 43:58.427
a dummy?

43:58.428 --> 44:01.513
I mean, comey... Come.

44:01.514 --> 44:03.307
Come to the party.

44:03.308 --> 44:05.434
Yeah. Sounds fun.

44:05.435 --> 44:06.644
Okay, cool.

44:07.937 --> 44:09.397
- All right,
- you're on your own, kid.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.732
Soph and I are off

44:10.733 --> 44:12.066
to ride the train.

44:21.451 --> 44:23.035
Merry Christmas.

44:24.245 --> 44:26.163
I know that smell.

44:26.164 --> 44:28.562
Oh, I've been looking for you,

44:28.563 --> 44:30.959
banana boy.

44:30.960 --> 44:33.003
Houston, we have a problem.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.922
- Here comes a whole bunch
- of ugly.

44:36.591 --> 44:38.550
Somebody stop that dog!

44:38.551 --> 44:40.594
Come back with my train!

44:40.595 --> 44:42.430
- We're gonna need
- a faster train.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.148
- Aah!
- Sorry!

44:52.151 --> 44:53.732
- Look out!
- Get out of my way!

44:58.821 --> 45:00.738
Santa could use a little helper.

45:00.739 --> 45:01.845
Don't worry, Santa,

45:01.846 --> 45:02.949
I'll save you.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.181
Hey, guys.

45:04.182 --> 45:05.411
I found a tree.

45:07.539 --> 45:08.748
Hello?

45:08.749 --> 45:09.956
What'd I miss?

45:09.957 --> 45:11.833
I'm here, Santa.

45:11.834 --> 45:13.628
- Jeez, did you guys
- see that?

45:13.631 --> 45:15.170
Monty!

45:15.171 --> 45:16.423
You know Monty?

45:16.424 --> 45:17.674
You know Monty?

45:19.592 --> 45:20.760
Well, I guess the monkey's

45:20.761 --> 45:21.927
out of the bag.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.182
- I was so worried
- that if I told you guys

45:26.185 --> 45:27.225
I almost finished my novel

45:27.226 --> 45:28.266
with Monty's help,

45:28.267 --> 45:29.685
you'd think I was crazy.

45:29.686 --> 45:31.019
Crazy talented.

45:31.020 --> 45:32.355
- What about me
- getting the lead

45:32.358 --> 45:33.981
- In Romeo and Juliet
- because of Monty?

45:33.984 --> 45:35.357
You learned from the best.

45:35.358 --> 45:36.732
Me, obviously.

45:36.733 --> 45:38.048
And me learning

45:38.049 --> 45:39.361
the balance beam.

45:39.362 --> 45:41.072
A monkey teaching gymnastics?

45:41.073 --> 45:42.780
Genius.

45:42.781 --> 45:44.824
Hey, whatever we tell your mom,

45:44.825 --> 45:45.952
it has to be after

45:45.953 --> 45:47.077
the Hartz Charity Gala.

45:47.078 --> 45:48.392
She'll be so relieved it's over,

45:48.393 --> 45:49.705
she'll be in a receptive mood.

45:49.706 --> 45:51.916
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- How long are we talking here?

45:51.919 --> 45:53.668
I told the kid that this

45:53.669 --> 45:55.419
is just a temporary assignment.

45:55.420 --> 45:56.755
You know, undercover,

45:56.756 --> 45:58.088
to learn my role.

45:58.089 --> 45:59.090
I have plans

45:59.091 --> 46:00.091
to fulfill my destiny

46:00.092 --> 46:01.343
of becoming the first

46:01.344 --> 46:02.593
monkey movie star.

46:02.594 --> 46:04.345
- At least stay until
- opening night.

46:04.348 --> 46:06.076
Please stay until

46:06.077 --> 46:07.805
my performance, coach.

46:07.806 --> 46:09.391
You think I'm gonna fall

46:09.392 --> 46:10.975
for those puppy-dog eyes?

46:10.976 --> 46:12.291
I'm an actor.

46:12.292 --> 46:13.605
I invented that look.

46:15.732 --> 46:16.753
Okay, great performance.

46:16.754 --> 46:17.773
You got me.

46:17.774 --> 46:18.922
I guess I could stay

46:18.923 --> 46:20.068
a little longer.

46:20.069 --> 46:22.529
Ha-ha!

46:22.530 --> 46:24.240
Monty, the monkey

46:24.241 --> 46:25.949
from the Monkey Up commercials,

46:25.950 --> 46:27.409
has disappeared.

46:27.410 --> 46:28.661
The police have not

46:28.662 --> 46:29.911
ruled out foul play.

46:29.912 --> 46:31.706
- I'm here at the Monkey Up
- Studios

46:31.709 --> 46:33.625
With Monty's longtime friend

46:33.626 --> 46:35.542
and trainer, Desmond.

46:35.543 --> 46:37.066
And the owner of Monkey Up,

46:37.067 --> 46:38.587
Stan Levin.

46:38.588 --> 46:40.298
- Levin.
- Levin.

46:40.301 --> 46:42.154
We're just so worried

46:42.155 --> 46:44.008
about our little baby.

46:44.009 --> 46:45.928
- All alone out there.
- We just...

46:45.931 --> 46:47.951
We... We... We... We miss

46:47.952 --> 46:49.974
our monkey so much.

46:51.559 --> 46:53.144
- Monty.
- Absolutely.

46:53.147 --> 46:54.520
Monty, if you can hear me,

46:54.521 --> 46:55.895
Dessy loves you.

46:55.896 --> 46:57.732
- So the ice rink will be
- by the tree at the back.

46:57.735 --> 47:00.192
- He was seen at a Christmas tree
- farm in Edgemont.

47:00.195 --> 47:01.736
- Okay, great.
- I'll see you soon. Bye.

47:01.739 --> 47:02.904
If anybody knows

47:02.905 --> 47:04.070
of Monty's whereabouts,

47:04.071 --> 47:05.782
please tweet using the hashtag

47:05.783 --> 47:07.491
"Where's Monty?"

47:07.492 --> 47:09.326
There will be a cash reward.

47:09.327 --> 47:13.037
Monkey Up, go bananas.

47:13.038 --> 47:14.394
Okay.

47:14.395 --> 47:15.749
I'm Erin Johnson for ETV.

47:15.750 --> 47:18.084
I'm glad you like it so much,

47:18.085 --> 47:19.524
but I could really

47:19.525 --> 47:20.962
use an advance.

47:20.963 --> 47:22.444
I know 10,000 is a lot to ask

47:22.445 --> 47:23.923
for a first novel,

47:23.924 --> 47:25.134
but it would really

47:25.135 --> 47:26.343
help me focus creatively.

47:26.344 --> 47:28.200
Oh, boy. This guy couldn't sell

47:28.201 --> 47:30.054
bananas to a monkey.

47:30.055 --> 47:31.912
Yeah, I know the ending could be

47:31.913 --> 47:33.767
a little more dramatic, and...

47:33.768 --> 47:35.916
Okay, well, I'll call you

47:35.917 --> 47:38.063
after the rewrite. Thanks.

47:53.496 --> 47:54.956
Tildon Publishing.

47:54.957 --> 47:56.414
Sandra speaking.

47:56.415 --> 47:58.584
Hi, Sandra, it's, uh...

48:00.378 --> 48:02.086
George M. Curious.

48:02.087 --> 48:03.402
Jim Andrews' agent, Sandy.

48:03.403 --> 48:04.715
Can I call you Sandy?

48:04.716 --> 48:06.384
- Uh, well...
- Of course I can.

48:06.387 --> 48:07.698
Sandy, baby doll,

48:07.699 --> 48:09.010
what you are offering us here

48:09.011 --> 48:10.554
is chump change.

48:10.555 --> 48:12.347
Help me help you.

48:12.348 --> 48:13.974
- There's a lot of heat
- on old Jimmy,

48:13.977 --> 48:15.810
- And a lot of people
- are talking.

48:15.813 --> 48:17.457
And those people are

48:17.458 --> 48:19.103
pretty big competitors of yours.

48:19.104 --> 48:20.897
- Now, you don't want us
- to swing.

48:20.900 --> 48:22.024
Swing?

48:22.025 --> 48:23.149
Swing, walk.

48:23.150 --> 48:24.777
- Let's not split bananas,
- Sandy.

48:24.780 --> 48:26.070
We both know this story

48:26.071 --> 48:27.362
will sell a million copies

48:27.363 --> 48:28.698
and make a great movie.

48:28.699 --> 48:30.031
What about the ending?

48:30.032 --> 48:32.242
Ending? That'll write itself.

48:32.243 --> 48:33.745
It'll be emotional and intense.

48:33.746 --> 48:35.245
I promise you, Sandy,

48:35.246 --> 48:36.663
Oscar-caliber.

48:36.664 --> 48:37.665
Sandy, baby,

48:37.666 --> 48:38.666
this is so high-concept,

48:38.667 --> 48:40.793
- why don't you just pitch it
- to a studio

48:40.796 --> 48:42.378
- And turn it into a movie
- right away?

48:42.381 --> 48:43.919
What about the price?

48:43.920 --> 48:45.777
All I'm saying, Sandy,

48:45.778 --> 48:47.632
is show me the money.

48:47.633 --> 48:49.468
The price has to be six digits.

48:49.469 --> 48:51.302
You pay, we stay.

48:51.303 --> 48:52.805
Ciao for now, baby.

48:55.474 --> 48:56.808
Monty.

48:56.809 --> 48:57.935
Hey, kids.

48:57.936 --> 48:59.060
I have nothing to wear

48:59.061 --> 49:00.167
to this shindig.

49:00.168 --> 49:01.272
Maybe I shouldn't go.

49:06.360 --> 49:07.778
Kid, where did you get that?

49:07.779 --> 49:09.195
It's perfect.

49:09.196 --> 49:10.865
I had it made. I told Mom

49:10.866 --> 49:12.532
it was for one of my dolls.

49:12.533 --> 49:14.452
- A monkey always
- has to look sharp.

49:14.455 --> 49:15.933
This is the nicest thing

49:15.934 --> 49:17.412
anyone's ever done for me.

49:17.413 --> 49:19.623
Monty, you're family now.

49:19.624 --> 49:21.376
Who, me? Family?

49:21.377 --> 49:23.126
Jeez, I don't know.

49:23.127 --> 49:24.669
Thanks.

49:24.670 --> 49:26.172
You know, kids,

49:26.173 --> 49:27.672
there's something I need to do.

49:27.673 --> 49:28.964
I could use your help.

49:28.965 --> 49:31.217
Anything, Monty.

49:31.218 --> 49:35.847
Wow, this place is amazing.

49:35.848 --> 49:37.515
Merry Christmas, guys.

49:37.516 --> 49:39.435
- Oh, look, everybody.
- A mirage.

49:39.438 --> 49:41.353
- The prodigal monkey
- has returned,

49:41.356 --> 49:43.147
- With his entourage
- no less.

49:43.150 --> 49:44.856
Isn't that a nice surprise, huh?

49:44.857 --> 49:47.902
Yo, Mr. Fancy Pants.

49:48.985 --> 49:50.445
What are you doing here?

49:50.446 --> 49:52.406
- To what do we owe the pleasure,
- Mr. Hollywood?

49:52.409 --> 49:53.679
Just spreading

49:53.680 --> 49:54.950
the Christmas cheer.

49:54.951 --> 49:56.910
Here you go, Mort.

49:56.911 --> 49:58.663
- This one's for you.
- Hope you like it.

49:58.666 --> 50:00.079
Seriously, bro?

50:00.080 --> 50:01.436
You think you can

50:01.437 --> 50:02.791
just buy us with presents?

50:02.792 --> 50:04.148
Are you kidding me?

50:04.149 --> 50:05.502
An iPhone?

50:05.503 --> 50:07.359
Oh, Mooner, wait till you see

50:07.360 --> 50:09.214
what I got you and Melody.

50:11.425 --> 50:12.718
It don't matter, Monty.

50:14.762 --> 50:15.805
You showed the color

50:15.806 --> 50:16.847
of your stripes

50:16.848 --> 50:18.767
when you left us

50:18.768 --> 50:20.684
in the dust after Mama died.

50:20.685 --> 50:22.978
Yeah. Yellow stripes.

50:22.979 --> 50:24.147
Well, I'm different.

50:24.148 --> 50:25.313
I've changed.

50:25.314 --> 50:27.190
I'm a family monkey now.

50:27.191 --> 50:28.985
- Oh, yeah, sure looks like it,
- bro.

50:28.988 --> 50:30.069
What, no diamond-bedazzled

50:30.070 --> 50:31.152
bow tie?

50:31.153 --> 50:33.489
- No, you're right. That would've
- been too much, huh?

50:33.492 --> 50:34.699
It's too little,

50:34.700 --> 50:35.907
too late, Monty.

50:35.908 --> 50:37.618
- I think it's best
- if you leave.

50:37.621 --> 50:39.536
Sayonara. Arrivederci.

50:39.537 --> 50:40.997
There's some big words for you,

50:40.998 --> 50:42.455
Mr. Fancy Pants. You like those?

50:42.456 --> 50:44.082
- Good. Now scram.
- I don't know

50:44.085 --> 50:45.626
What I was thinking coming here.

50:45.627 --> 50:47.168
Poof. You never saw me.

50:47.169 --> 50:48.233
Hey, Monty.

50:48.234 --> 50:49.295
Yeah, Mooner?

50:49.296 --> 50:52.256
Kiss my monkey butt.

50:52.257 --> 50:55.301
Now scram, skedaddle, get lost.

50:55.302 --> 50:57.137
- We don't want you here
- no more.

50:57.140 --> 50:59.263
I'm so sorry, Monty.

50:59.264 --> 51:01.224
You okay?

51:01.225 --> 51:02.247
It's cool, guys.

51:02.248 --> 51:03.267
No biggie.

51:03.268 --> 51:04.583
I never was much

51:04.584 --> 51:05.896
of a family monkey anyway.

51:05.897 --> 51:07.065
Come on, we've got a gala

51:07.066 --> 51:08.232
to attend.

51:18.492 --> 51:20.745
Good job, Mom!

51:28.002 --> 51:29.502
Great, my first red carpet

51:29.503 --> 51:31.005
- and I'm hiding
- in a cape.

51:32.130 --> 51:33.339
Sir. To your lady.

51:33.340 --> 51:34.717
- Why?
- I know.

51:37.428 --> 51:39.679
Hi, how are you guys?

51:39.680 --> 51:41.515
Mr. Hartz, Ms. Andrews.

51:41.516 --> 51:43.349
You guys look fantastic.

51:43.350 --> 51:45.540
We are here with Mr. Hartz,

51:45.541 --> 51:47.729
chairman of Hartz Toyz,

51:47.730 --> 51:48.918
and Clare Andrews,

51:48.919 --> 51:50.105
the new president.

51:50.106 --> 51:51.817
- Let's go.
- Now, Mr. Hartz,

51:51.820 --> 51:53.152
This annual charity event

51:53.153 --> 51:54.485
was started by your grandfather

51:54.486 --> 51:55.529
over 50 years ago.

51:55.530 --> 51:56.571
That's right.

51:56.572 --> 51:58.323
- It's only fitting
- that we give back

51:58.326 --> 52:00.325
- To kids in need
- every Christmas.

52:00.328 --> 52:01.743
Lovely. Well, Clare,

52:01.744 --> 52:03.160
you have created

52:03.161 --> 52:05.372
- the perfect scene for
- the Annual Hartz Charity Gala.

52:05.375 --> 52:06.540
Oh, thank you. Yes, well,

52:06.541 --> 52:07.707
we wanted it to feel magical

52:07.708 --> 52:08.772
for the children

52:08.773 --> 52:09.834
as well as the adults.

52:09.835 --> 52:11.754
And I really owe it all

52:11.755 --> 52:13.671
to the support of my family.

52:13.672 --> 52:14.799
Um...

52:14.800 --> 52:15.925
Yeah.

52:21.555 --> 52:22.682
Okay, Monty,

52:22.683 --> 52:23.807
hang out here.

52:23.808 --> 52:25.622
When Taylor arrives,

52:25.623 --> 52:27.435
I'll call you on Sophie's phone.

52:27.436 --> 52:29.105
- You know, kid,
- eventually you're gonna

52:29.108 --> 52:30.856
- Have to talk to her
- without me.

52:30.859 --> 52:32.441
Ciao for now, baby.

52:41.408 --> 52:42.702
Hey, looks like a pretty

52:42.703 --> 52:43.994
happening party.

52:43.995 --> 52:45.871
Time to mingle like a single.

52:51.961 --> 52:53.170
Hey, kids,

52:53.171 --> 52:54.379
I could use a drink.

52:56.757 --> 52:58.134
He's so cool.

52:59.217 --> 53:00.886
He's so well dressed.

53:04.515 --> 53:06.850
Ah, that hit the spot.

53:06.851 --> 53:07.852
Yeah, sorry,

53:07.853 --> 53:08.853
can't really linger.

53:08.854 --> 53:10.062
Us celebs are always moving

53:10.063 --> 53:11.270
and shaking.

53:11.271 --> 53:12.439
On the go go,

53:12.440 --> 53:13.607
you know what I'm saying?

53:18.320 --> 53:21.031
You're sweating.

53:21.032 --> 53:22.346
Hi, Ethan.

53:22.347 --> 53:23.658
Hey, Taylor.

53:23.659 --> 53:26.494
You, uh, look super.

53:26.495 --> 53:28.122
Thanks. You look nice too.

53:29.165 --> 53:31.290
This place is so beautiful.

53:31.291 --> 53:32.710
Uh, this is my sister,

53:32.711 --> 53:34.128
Sophie.

53:35.546 --> 53:37.194
You know we're neighbors.

53:37.195 --> 53:38.840
We've met before.

53:38.841 --> 53:40.989
Nice to meet you again

53:40.990 --> 53:43.137
for the bazillionth time.

53:46.182 --> 53:47.496
Go get Monty.

53:47.497 --> 53:48.808
I'm dying here.

53:48.809 --> 53:50.226
Okay.

53:54.398 --> 53:55.545
Mr. Cappello. Huge fan.

53:55.546 --> 53:56.691
Hey.

53:56.692 --> 53:58.276
- How you doing?
- Good to see you.

53:58.279 --> 53:59.298
Good to see you.

53:59.299 --> 54:00.319
I'm a huge fan.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.385
Hey, look at this.

54:02.386 --> 54:04.448
A cute little monkey.

54:04.449 --> 54:05.846
You gotta hand it to him,

54:05.847 --> 54:07.242
he's smarter than he looks.

54:07.243 --> 54:09.371
He can talk?

54:10.789 --> 54:12.289
Uh, well, ahem...

54:12.290 --> 54:13.624
Bottoms up.

54:13.625 --> 54:15.169
Down the hatch.

54:24.678 --> 54:26.388
- It's a movie about
- human relationships

54:26.391 --> 54:28.182
- And the intricacies
- of family.

54:28.185 --> 54:30.101
Well, nice chatting with you

54:30.102 --> 54:32.018
folks, but my destiny awaits.

54:32.019 --> 54:33.687
It's time for my close-up.

54:45.032 --> 54:47.451
Monty, you never listen.

54:48.577 --> 54:49.870
Oh, my gosh,

54:49.871 --> 54:51.162
is that Angelo Cappello?

54:51.163 --> 54:53.373
Uh, maybe?

54:54.374 --> 54:56.251
We have a 911 emergency.

54:56.252 --> 54:57.357
Monty's wandering

54:57.358 --> 54:58.461
around the party.

54:58.462 --> 54:59.651
Who's Monty?

54:59.652 --> 55:00.838
Uh...

55:00.839 --> 55:02.048
He's our monkey.

55:02.049 --> 55:03.113
Wait a sec,

55:03.114 --> 55:04.175
you have a pet monkey?

55:04.176 --> 55:06.095
He doesn't respond well

55:06.096 --> 55:08.012
to the term "pet."

55:08.013 --> 55:10.514
It's a long story.

55:10.515 --> 55:12.559
We gotta find him fast.

55:16.312 --> 55:17.648
Atten-hut!

55:20.901 --> 55:22.861
At ease, soldier.

55:25.447 --> 55:28.283
Oh, wow!

55:28.284 --> 55:30.410
- It's Monty
- from the Monkey Up commercials.

55:30.413 --> 55:31.453
Hey, toots.

55:31.454 --> 55:32.495
It's your lucky day.

55:32.496 --> 55:33.894
You're getting an exclusive

55:33.895 --> 55:35.290
with next year's Oscar winner.

55:35.291 --> 55:36.540
Roll on this.

55:36.541 --> 55:37.584
You see,

55:37.585 --> 55:38.626
I've been incognito

55:38.627 --> 55:40.336
- writing a tour-de-force
- family drama

55:40.339 --> 55:41.672
Called, uh,

55:41.673 --> 55:43.006
Home With A Heart.

55:43.007 --> 55:44.467
Okay.

55:44.468 --> 55:45.925
Co-written by Jimbo Andrews.

55:45.926 --> 55:47.053
Starring me, of course.

55:47.054 --> 55:48.178
Let me tell you, babe.

55:48.179 --> 55:49.743
This is going to be

55:49.744 --> 55:51.306
a great movie.

55:51.307 --> 55:53.057
What the...?

55:53.058 --> 55:54.289
What?

55:54.290 --> 55:55.518
Monty's all over Twitter.

55:55.519 --> 55:56.958
My days of working on those

55:56.959 --> 55:58.395
terrible Monkey Up commercials

55:58.396 --> 55:59.814
are over.

55:59.815 --> 56:01.317
- He's making
- a mockery of me!

56:01.320 --> 56:03.319
- No more pitching
- those caffeinated

56:03.322 --> 56:05.070
Sugar energy drinks.

56:07.739 --> 56:09.012
Oh, Clare, Clare,

56:09.013 --> 56:10.283
I've gotta hand it to you.

56:10.284 --> 56:12.328
- This is the best charity gala
- we've had to date.

56:12.331 --> 56:14.079
- Oh!
- A toast...

56:14.082 --> 56:15.370
To Madam President.

56:15.371 --> 56:17.415
Thanks.

56:18.876 --> 56:20.231
Oh, and a nice touch

56:20.232 --> 56:21.586
with that talking monkey.

56:23.588 --> 56:24.964
Uh...

56:24.965 --> 56:25.987
I'm sorry.

56:25.988 --> 56:27.008
Did you say a monkey?

56:27.009 --> 56:29.010
Yeah.

56:29.011 --> 56:30.220
I'll be right back.

56:30.221 --> 56:32.181
- I gotta use
- the boy's room.

56:43.901 --> 56:45.319
Souped-up coupe.

56:45.320 --> 56:46.736
Fire-engine red.

56:46.737 --> 56:48.176
Shiny new rims.

56:48.177 --> 56:49.614
Very, very nice.

56:51.033 --> 56:52.325
Gentlemen.

56:52.326 --> 56:53.431
Your invitations,

56:53.432 --> 56:54.535
if you don't mind.

56:54.536 --> 56:55.537
Invitations, yeah.

56:55.538 --> 56:56.538
Where's your invitation?

56:56.539 --> 56:58.228
Oh, boy, here comes trouble

56:58.229 --> 56:59.917
with a capital T.

57:01.210 --> 57:03.128
- Monty!
- Monty! Monty!

57:05.047 --> 57:06.361
Hey, doll, fancy a little

57:06.362 --> 57:07.674
grand theft auto?

57:10.761 --> 57:12.887
You're coming with me!

57:12.888 --> 57:14.431
Monty, please don't make this

57:14.432 --> 57:15.973
harder than it needs to be.

57:15.974 --> 57:18.936
Move it or lose it, Dessy.

57:21.188 --> 57:22.522
Monty!

57:25.567 --> 57:26.589
Dessy!

57:26.590 --> 57:27.610
Was that a speed bump?

57:27.611 --> 57:29.446
Monty!

57:30.614 --> 57:32.283
- Get out of the way!
- Monty.

57:32.286 --> 57:33.992
The fast and furriest.

57:37.371 --> 57:39.163
You can't shake me!

57:39.164 --> 57:41.083
Whoo!

57:50.467 --> 57:52.886
Avalanche!

57:54.012 --> 57:55.888
Yeah!

57:55.889 --> 57:57.182
My wig!

57:57.183 --> 57:58.474
Get out of the way!

57:58.475 --> 58:01.352
Get your hands off my wig!

58:01.353 --> 58:03.188
Get that monkey!

58:04.689 --> 58:06.858
Monty. Monty.

58:19.496 --> 58:20.977
Where'd he go?

58:20.978 --> 58:22.457
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

58:22.458 --> 58:24.167
He went this way!

58:24.168 --> 58:25.919
- Monty! Monty!
- Monty?

58:25.922 --> 58:27.796
- Monty? Where'd he go?
- Think like a monkey!

58:27.799 --> 58:29.047
Okay, think.

58:37.681 --> 58:39.016
Whoa!

58:40.351 --> 58:42.353
Yeah!

58:52.070 --> 58:54.281
Oh, no. Monty.

58:56.074 --> 58:57.222
Monty, I didn't know

58:57.223 --> 58:58.369
you could drive.

59:03.332 --> 59:04.915
Monty, are you okay?

59:04.916 --> 59:06.750
Yeah, kid. I'm okay.

59:06.751 --> 59:07.940
Wish I could say the same

59:07.941 --> 59:09.129
about this party.

59:10.255 --> 59:12.007
- Well, you know
- what they say.

59:12.010 --> 59:13.217
There's no such thing

59:13.218 --> 59:14.426
as bad publicity, am I right?

59:20.932 --> 59:22.475
Whoopsie daisy.

59:22.476 --> 59:23.790
Clare, you know

59:23.791 --> 59:25.102
this monkey?

59:25.103 --> 59:26.417
No. No, Mr. Hartz,

59:26.418 --> 59:27.730
I don't.

59:27.731 --> 59:29.003
What is going on here?

59:29.004 --> 59:30.274
I can explain.

59:30.275 --> 59:32.319
Nobody makes a monkey

59:32.320 --> 59:34.362
out of me.

59:34.363 --> 59:36.720
You'll regret the day

59:36.721 --> 59:39.075
you stole my property.

59:39.076 --> 59:40.557
Oh, yeah? Well, why don't we

59:40.558 --> 59:42.036
settle this like monkeys?

59:42.037 --> 59:43.204
Put them up. Come on.

59:43.205 --> 59:44.789
- You want a piece of me?
- Come on!

59:44.792 --> 59:46.166
- Stay back, sir.
- Come on!

59:46.169 --> 59:47.334
Hold me back,

59:47.335 --> 59:48.501
hold me back.

59:48.502 --> 59:50.733
We didn't steal Monty.

59:50.734 --> 59:52.963
He left to follow his dream.

59:52.964 --> 59:54.049
I got a contract

59:54.050 --> 59:55.132
and a court order

59:55.133 --> 59:56.927
- that says that
- that monkey

59:56.930 --> 01:00:01.390
Is all mine, officer.

01:00:04.393 --> 01:00:06.270
This is a court order that I am

01:00:06.271 --> 01:00:08.146
obligated to enforce. I'm sorry.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.649
He's right.

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:14.527
I'm sorry, kids.

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:16.301
I guess I am just a fraud.

01:00:16.302 --> 01:00:18.072
Not even an actor.

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.283
I'm just someone's pet.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.210
- Here's looking at you,
- kiddo.

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.472
- Let's go!
- No!

01:00:41.475 --> 01:00:43.557
Don't. Please.

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:48.145
Dad, do something.

01:00:48.146 --> 01:00:49.937
Monty's a part of our family.

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:51.252
I'm sorry.

01:00:51.253 --> 01:00:52.566
He's a monkey.

01:00:53.858 --> 01:00:55.360
It's his property.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.070
Monty's not a toy.

01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:00.156
He doesn't belong to anyone.

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:01.617
He's a real monkey

01:01:01.618 --> 01:01:03.076
with real feelings.

01:01:16.548 --> 01:01:17.965
Sophie.

01:01:17.966 --> 01:01:21.219
Monty!

01:01:29.894 --> 01:01:32.084
We love you, Monty.

01:01:32.085 --> 01:01:34.274
We really do.

01:01:58.256 --> 01:01:59.404
Now, can somebody please

01:01:59.405 --> 01:02:00.550
explain to me

01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:02.365
how a talking monkey

01:02:02.366 --> 01:02:04.178
has been living in my house

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:06.077
without me knowing

01:02:06.078 --> 01:02:07.973
about it?

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:09.455
Monty's not just

01:02:09.456 --> 01:02:10.934
a talking monkey.

01:02:10.935 --> 01:02:13.604
He's my best friend.

01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:15.336
He taught me not

01:02:15.337 --> 01:02:17.066
to be afraid of heights.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:19.465
You didn't even know Sophie got

01:02:19.466 --> 01:02:21.862
really good at gymnastics.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:24.532
And I'm sure you have no idea

01:02:24.533 --> 01:02:25.909
that I got the lead

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:27.284
in Romeo and Juliet.

01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:29.454
And I wouldn't have been able

01:02:29.455 --> 01:02:31.622
to finish my book without him.

01:02:31.623 --> 01:02:33.605
Maybe we would have told you

01:02:33.606 --> 01:02:35.585
about Monty...

01:02:35.586 --> 01:02:37.504
if you'd been here to tell.

01:03:17.753 --> 01:03:20.170
Yeah, Sophie!

01:03:20.171 --> 01:03:22.215
Yeah, Sophie!

01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:28.345
And action.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:29.806
Drink Monkey Up

01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:31.265
and go bananas.

01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:32.517
Cut!

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:36.292
A little emotion

01:03:36.293 --> 01:03:37.813
would be nice.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:39.608
But soft, what light

01:03:39.609 --> 01:03:41.400
through yonder window breaks?

01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:43.257
It is the east,

01:03:43.258 --> 01:03:45.112
and Juliet is the sun.

01:03:45.113 --> 01:03:48.033
Arise, fair sun,

01:03:48.034 --> 01:03:50.951
and kill the envious moon.

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:52.204
Yeah, this is a pretty

01:03:52.205 --> 01:03:53.454
solid contract.

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:55.248
Oh, see, there is

01:03:55.249 --> 01:03:57.040
a buyout clause here for...

01:03:57.041 --> 01:03:59.461
$100,000.

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:23.443
Hey, Soph.

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:26.634
We're gonna get

01:04:26.635 --> 01:04:28.156
Monty back.

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:33.411
- Thought you were
- going to work?

01:04:33.414 --> 01:04:35.496
Nope.

01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:37.122
I spoke with Mr. Hartz,

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:38.687
who said that Hartz has

01:04:38.688 --> 01:04:40.250
always been a family company.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:41.357
And he gave me a month off

01:04:41.358 --> 01:04:42.461
after Christmas

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:43.630
to get our family

01:04:43.631 --> 01:04:44.797
settled in properly.

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:45.924
That's great, honey.

01:04:45.925 --> 01:04:47.050
Mm-hmm.

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:54.850
- Gosh, and I've been
- so consumed by work

01:04:54.853 --> 01:04:56.414
I haven't even congratulated you

01:04:56.415 --> 01:04:57.976
on finishing your manuscript.

01:04:57.977 --> 01:05:00.188
Thanks.

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:03.982
It's my publisher.

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:06.193
Hi, Sandra.

01:05:06.194 --> 01:05:09.279
Sure, I'll call you Sandy.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.698
My agent drives

01:05:10.699 --> 01:05:12.115
a hard bargain?

01:05:12.116 --> 01:05:13.577
Agent?

01:05:17.748 --> 01:05:20.313
Oh, yeah, that sounds fair.

01:05:20.314 --> 01:05:22.877
I... I accept that.

01:05:22.878 --> 01:05:25.589
Okay, bye. Thanks.

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:27.674
Whoo-hoo!

01:05:27.675 --> 01:05:28.716
What? What? What?

01:05:28.717 --> 01:05:30.364
It's an offer for the rights

01:05:30.365 --> 01:05:32.010
to turn it into a movie.

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:33.430
And I get to write the script.

01:05:33.431 --> 01:05:34.847
Yeah.

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:36.266
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:05:36.269 --> 01:05:37.538
She said my agent

01:05:37.539 --> 01:05:38.809
was a tough negotiator.

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:41.061
Who's your agent?

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:42.647
I think I have an idea.

01:05:47.736 --> 01:05:49.820
Mort, Mooner, Melody.

01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:50.947
Hi, I'm Ethan,

01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:52.073
and this is Sophie.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.910
- We were here
- the other day

01:05:54.913 --> 01:05:56.787
- With Monty when he gave you
- those gifts.

01:05:59.163 --> 01:06:00.748
We know you can talk.

01:06:00.749 --> 01:06:02.541
Uh, no, we can't.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:04.377
- All right, all right,
- you got us, okay?

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:05.462
Monty's in trouble

01:06:05.463 --> 01:06:06.545
and he needs your help.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.194
Oh, please. We've been following

01:06:08.195 --> 01:06:09.840
him on Twitter.

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:11.656
He made it very clear

01:06:11.657 --> 01:06:13.469
he's too good for us zoo folk.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:14.763
Monty may not have said it,

01:06:14.764 --> 01:06:16.054
but he loves you guys.

01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:18.056
Besides, you're family,

01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:19.935
- and family's always there
- in a time of need.

01:06:19.938 --> 01:06:21.270
Monty's in trouble

01:06:21.271 --> 01:06:22.603
and he needs you.

01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:23.876
Okay, okay,

01:06:23.877 --> 01:06:25.147
I have to admit,

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.400
we've been feeling

01:06:26.401 --> 01:06:27.650
a tinge of guilt.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:28.902
He's being held hostage

01:06:28.903 --> 01:06:30.152
at Monkey Up.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:31.696
We have to bust him out.

01:06:31.697 --> 01:06:33.238
Help us save your brother.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:34.698
I'm all in.

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:35.909
I'm just saying,

01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:37.117
this was clearly a re-gift.

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:38.161
Dozens of selfies.

01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:39.202
Who is this kid anyway?

01:06:39.203 --> 01:06:40.476
Mort, don't make me

01:06:40.477 --> 01:06:41.747
come up there.

01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:43.291
- All right, all right.
- I'm in.

01:06:43.294 --> 01:06:44.918
Me too.

01:06:44.919 --> 01:06:46.544
Let's bail out Mr. Fancy Pants.

01:06:47.838 --> 01:06:49.463
Uh, one problem.

01:06:49.464 --> 01:06:51.257
- How we gonna get you guys
- out of here?

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:52.654
Oh, please. The monkeys have

01:06:52.655 --> 01:06:54.050
been running the zoo for years.

01:06:54.051 --> 01:06:55.741
Between youse and me,

01:06:55.742 --> 01:06:57.429
the zookeeper's a nice guy,

01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:58.744
but he's not the brightest

01:06:58.745 --> 01:07:00.056
banana in the bunch.

01:07:00.057 --> 01:07:01.538
We've had a key for as long

01:07:01.539 --> 01:07:03.019
as I can remember.

01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:07.023
Sophie?

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:12.925
"Mom, Dad, we're going

01:07:12.926 --> 01:07:14.112
to save Monty."

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:15.260
I'll start the car.

01:07:15.261 --> 01:07:16.407
I'll lock the doors.

01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:30.337
Now what are we gonna do?

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:32.214
We have to get in there.

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.132
How?

01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:35.885
Uh, we'll split up.

01:07:35.886 --> 01:07:37.325
I'm assuming you guys

01:07:37.326 --> 01:07:38.762
can jump over the gate?

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:39.994
You just watch

01:07:39.995 --> 01:07:41.224
and learn, fella.

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:59.492
Sophie, follow me.

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.296
Huh?

01:08:33.298 --> 01:08:34.401
There you are.

01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:36.613
Sophie?

01:08:38.073 --> 01:08:39.616
How'd you get in here?

01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:45.475
Kids, what are you

01:08:45.477 --> 01:08:46.705
doing here?

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:48.415
We came to bring you home.

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:49.417
You know, kids,

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:50.417
my mama always said

01:08:50.419 --> 01:08:52.608
that fame and fortune come

01:08:52.609 --> 01:08:54.796
and go, but family is forever.

01:08:54.798 --> 01:08:56.591
I didn't understand what she

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:58.384
meant until I met you guys.

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:03.680
Mooner?

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.308
Melody?

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:09.603
Mort? You guys came too?

01:09:09.604 --> 01:09:11.773
- Look, Monty,
- you're our brother, all right?

01:09:11.776 --> 01:09:13.796
And as much as you're a

01:09:13.796 --> 01:09:15.818
prima donna, you're also family.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.111
And that's forever.

01:09:17.112 --> 01:09:18.319
Yeah.

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.156
- I missed your skinny bum-bum,
- bro.

01:09:20.158 --> 01:09:21.615
I wrote youse a song

01:09:21.616 --> 01:09:22.701
just to tell you

01:09:22.702 --> 01:09:23.783
how much I love you.

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:28.705
♪ Monty, you're our brother ♪

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:32.835
♪ And even if you're a diva ♪

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:36.587
♪ We love you ♪

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:38.381
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:39.926
Thank you, Melody.

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:41.468
That was more than we needed.

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:43.219
What? I haven't finished yet.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.618
I was about to do

01:09:44.618 --> 01:09:46.015
the crescendo.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:48.081
Yeah, but that was... That was

01:09:48.082 --> 01:09:50.144
plenty for me to feel the love.

01:09:50.145 --> 01:09:51.645
It's not my fault, Stan. Okay?

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:52.877
He refuses to come out

01:09:52.877 --> 01:09:54.106
of his trailer.

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:55.524
They're coming.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:57.484
Monty is a Method actor.

01:09:57.485 --> 01:09:59.425
He responds to positive

01:09:59.426 --> 01:10:01.363
motivation.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:03.637
Well, this is gonna positively

01:10:03.638 --> 01:10:05.909
motivate that stupid monkey.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.454
Monty, how many Monkey Up

01:10:07.455 --> 01:10:08.996
costumes do you have?

01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:10.581
Well, let's see.

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:14.418
You're fired.

01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:18.486
Look at that. Wardrobe just

01:10:18.487 --> 01:10:19.840
dropped off a bunch of new ones.

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:21.676
- Are youse guys thinking
- what I'm thinking?

01:10:21.679 --> 01:10:23.490
Ooh, ooh! I got it! Time to play

01:10:23.491 --> 01:10:25.304
monkey in the middle.

01:10:26.848 --> 01:10:28.098
Give me the key.

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:31.393
I'm fired, remember?

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:36.314
Security, bust it in!

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:38.274
Yo, over heres.

01:10:38.275 --> 01:10:39.777
Kiss my monkey butt.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:44.990
Over here, fellas.

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:46.388
Hey, Tweedledums,

01:10:46.389 --> 01:10:47.785
behind youse.

01:10:50.287 --> 01:10:53.707
Get those monkeys!

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:55.043
I think those monkeys are trying

01:10:55.044 --> 01:10:56.377
to make a monkey out of me!

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:11.558
Going somewhere?

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:13.435
We're taking Monty home.

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:14.979
Oh, his home

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.522
is on that can.

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:19.274
Over here.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.797
Are you kidding me?

01:11:20.798 --> 01:11:22.318
Why would I trust you?

01:11:22.319 --> 01:11:23.508
What's your alternative, huh?

01:11:23.509 --> 01:11:24.696
Ha! Good point.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:26.950
Come on. Quick. This way.

01:11:26.951 --> 01:11:29.201
That way. Go that way. Go.

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:30.994
Which way, Monty?

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.101
Beats me, kid.

01:11:32.102 --> 01:11:33.205
I've never been in here.

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:34.539
Stan. Stan!

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.708
Uh, this way.

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:39.170
I can't.

01:11:39.171 --> 01:11:41.630
I won't let you harm Monty.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:44.134
You're an even more pathetic

01:11:44.135 --> 01:11:46.636
action hero than animal trainer.

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:49.764
That tickles.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:12:00.150
You're in my world now!

01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:09.242
- Gotcha!
- Not so fast.

01:12:09.245 --> 01:12:11.327
Freeze right there.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:15.873
Oh, yeah.

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:19.877
This is too much fun.

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:26.508
Hi.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:27.843
Names?

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:29.636
Jim and Clare Andrews.

01:12:29.637 --> 01:12:31.346
We're here because...

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:32.889
Uh, yeah, sorry.

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:34.183
Nobody by that name

01:12:34.184 --> 01:12:35.475
on the list.

01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:36.519
We're friends

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.560
with Monty the Monkey.

01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:39.354
Yeah, actually, we're family.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:40.815
Oh, you're relatives

01:12:40.816 --> 01:12:42.274
with Monty.

01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:43.902
That would make you

01:12:43.903 --> 01:12:45.527
the monkey's uncle.

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:47.322
- Please, our children
- are in there.

01:12:47.325 --> 01:12:48.573
Ah, right. I guess

01:12:48.574 --> 01:12:49.823
they're baby monkeys

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:52.118
that need their mama monkey

01:12:52.119 --> 01:12:54.411
for being the mama.

01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:58.791
No! Oh, no!

01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:08.633
You're trapped now.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:10.219
Nowhere to run

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:11.804
and nowhere to hide.

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:44.587
I don't give up

01:13:44.588 --> 01:13:45.837
that easy!

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:47.215
Over here, big boy.

01:14:00.395 --> 01:14:02.188
- There's an exit.
- Come on.

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:10.988
Hurry!

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:19.914
We're trapped.

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.168
All right!

01:14:24.169 --> 01:14:25.710
Enough tomfoolery!

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:27.651
Give me back my monkey!

01:14:27.652 --> 01:14:29.589
He's my property!

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.363
Monty, you can jump,

01:14:31.364 --> 01:14:33.135
just like the commercial.

01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:34.761
You're wearing your parachute.

01:14:34.762 --> 01:14:36.054
Go, Monty, jump.

01:14:36.055 --> 01:14:37.745
I can't.

01:14:37.746 --> 01:14:39.434
Monty, you have to.

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:43.479
- He didn't tell you,
- did he?

01:14:43.482 --> 01:14:45.189
Monty's afraid of heights.

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:46.898
He ain't gonna jump.

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:48.401
Hey, why don't we get your stunt

01:14:48.402 --> 01:14:49.901
monkey to do the jump

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:51.425
and you and I will go and eat

01:14:51.426 --> 01:14:52.947
jelly beans? How's that sound?

01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:58.327
You're afraid of heights?

01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:00.287
I'm an actor. I act.

01:15:00.288 --> 01:15:01.352
I've never had to do

01:15:01.353 --> 01:15:02.414
my own stunts.

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:04.167
- What?
- I just told you guys

01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:06.732
I had no fear because I guess

01:15:06.733 --> 01:15:09.296
I wanted you to like me.

01:15:09.297 --> 01:15:10.965
- We like you just the way
- you are.

01:15:10.968 --> 01:15:13.133
You do?

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:14.364
Sophie!

01:15:14.365 --> 01:15:15.593
Ethan!

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:18.035
Enough of this jibber-jabber.

01:15:18.036 --> 01:15:20.475
Give me my monkey now!

01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:23.707
No!

01:15:23.708 --> 01:15:24.769
Sophie. No!

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:26.771
Monty!

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:28.191
Gotcha.

01:15:29.359 --> 01:15:31.235
Monty!

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:35.489
Whoo-hoo! We did it.

01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:37.179
We're flying,

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:38.867
we're flying.

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:40.328
You saved me, Monty.

01:15:40.329 --> 01:15:41.786
You're a real-life hero.

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:43.581
A hero? Come on, I just did

01:15:43.582 --> 01:15:45.375
what any monkey would do.

01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:52.088
Monty. Monty, you did it.

01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:53.965
I'm so glad you're okay.

01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:55.342
You were flying!

01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:56.657
I think I could get used

01:15:56.658 --> 01:15:57.969
to this mushy stuff.

01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:59.472
Move.

01:16:00.681 --> 01:16:02.474
No matter where you go,

01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:04.434
I'll find you.

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:06.270
Your face is everywhere.

01:16:06.271 --> 01:16:08.104
You belong to me!

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:09.898
No, I'm done running.

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:11.400
I ran away from the zoo.

01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:12.861
I ran away from

01:16:12.862 --> 01:16:14.319
my mama and my siblings.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.571
It's time I start running

01:16:15.572 --> 01:16:16.821
towards something.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:18.324
This is my family,

01:16:18.325 --> 01:16:19.824
and no matter what happens,

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:21.910
family is forever.

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.955
I have a contract

01:16:23.956 --> 01:16:25.997
that says you're my property!

01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:28.375
Monty.

01:16:28.376 --> 01:16:30.503
I'm sorry.

01:16:30.504 --> 01:16:32.628
It's all my fault.

01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:34.382
- I got blinded
- by the money.

01:16:34.385 --> 01:16:36.508
Desmond, give me a dollar.

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:37.552
One dollar?

01:16:37.553 --> 01:16:38.594
I just need a dollar.

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:43.306
Okay.

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:44.872
You have just engaged

01:16:44.873 --> 01:16:46.435
my legal services.

01:16:46.436 --> 01:16:48.395
And as his attorney,

01:16:48.396 --> 01:16:49.897
- I will note
- that in his contract,

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:51.606
There is a buyout clause.

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.150
Yeah.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:56.778
For $100,000.

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:59.197
As if.

01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:00.595
Where is he gonna come up

01:17:00.596 --> 01:17:01.991
with that?

01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:03.452
My client

01:17:03.453 --> 01:17:04.911
and my friend Monty

01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:06.476
would like to invoke

01:17:06.477 --> 01:17:08.040
that said clause.

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:16.173
Yo, hold up there.

01:17:17.592 --> 01:17:19.384
We have target acquired.

01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:20.635
Bombs away.

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.678
And fire!

01:17:22.679 --> 01:17:25.890
What? No. Hey. What?

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:27.517
Whoa, that's an easy target.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:29.269
No!

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:32.189
That's it! Aah!

01:17:34.442 --> 01:17:36.901
You guys were awesome.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:38.216
My sis has got

01:17:38.217 --> 01:17:39.529
the meanest throw.

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:41.491
Oh, Monty. You always did know

01:17:41.492 --> 01:17:43.450
how to give a lady a compliment.

01:17:43.451 --> 01:17:45.453
I didn't doubt you for a minute,

01:17:45.454 --> 01:17:47.454
bro, except for when I did.

01:17:47.455 --> 01:17:49.414
Bro, you were a textbook monkey.

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:50.958
- I knew you had it
- in you.

01:17:50.961 --> 01:17:52.105
Where'd you get all them

01:17:52.106 --> 01:17:53.251
bananas, huh?

01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:55.004
Well, you'll have to thank

01:17:55.005 --> 01:17:56.754
my agent for that one.

01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:58.089
I've been adapted?

01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.529
You mean "adopted."

01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:00.967
Welcome to the family.

01:18:00.968 --> 01:18:02.220
All right!

01:18:02.221 --> 01:18:03.470
You were right, Monty.

01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:04.639
Everyone does love

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.805
a happy ending.

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:07.120
You know, I have an idea

01:18:07.121 --> 01:18:08.433
for a new ending.

01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:09.602
Really? That's great,

01:18:09.603 --> 01:18:10.768
because Cappello called.

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:12.584
He's optioning our script.

01:18:12.585 --> 01:18:14.397
We are making a movie!

01:18:14.398 --> 01:18:16.380
We're making a movie?

01:18:16.381 --> 01:18:18.361
We're making a movie? What?

01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:22.093
We's making a movie?

01:18:22.094 --> 01:18:23.406
I didn't even audition.

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:25.263
Oh, I'll be the Marilyn Monroe

01:18:25.264 --> 01:18:27.118
of monkeys.

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:28.329
I always knew

01:18:28.330 --> 01:18:29.538
I was gonna be famous.

01:18:29.539 --> 01:18:30.582
Come on.

01:18:30.583 --> 01:18:31.623
Dad, can I be in it?

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:32.625
Uh, well, we'll see.

01:18:32.626 --> 01:18:33.626
You'll have to audition.

01:18:33.627 --> 01:18:35.210
