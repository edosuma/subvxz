Welcome to <i>Pop goes the diva.</i>

00:10.860 --> 00:13.370
I'm your host, Chyna Parks.

00:13.480 --> 00:17.060
Tonight, I'd like to introduce
you to a rising star.

00:17.100 --> 00:21.070
Give it up for Chyna Parks!

00:21.100 --> 00:23.870
Whoo! Chyna!
We love you!

00:25.910 --> 00:29.170
It's great to be here, Chyna.

00:29.210 --> 00:31.110
Thanks for coming, Chyna.

00:31.140 --> 00:34.150
What are you going to sing for us today?

00:34.180 --> 00:36.850
Well, pick any item in the room!

00:36.880 --> 00:40.890
I'll write a smash song about it.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.060
How about a soccer ball?

00:46.090 --> 00:48.830
Great idea!

00:48.860 --> 00:51.100
Soccer ball it is.

00:51.130 --> 00:54.170

01:08.380 --> 01:10.080
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:17.920 --> 01:18.820
Oh, good.
You're done.

01:22.090 --> 01:23.800
I need the computer.

01:23.830 --> 01:24.860
I'm making another movie.

01:24.900 --> 01:27.100
Please don't tell me it's a sequel.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.770
To the one you did
with the talking oysters.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.100
You mean
<i>the seashell network?</i>

01:33.040 --> 01:34.770
<i>If you guys were</i>
<i>the inventors of fishbook,</i>

01:34.810 --> 01:38.010
<i>You'd have</i>
<i>invented fishbook.</i>

01:39.980 --> 01:42.880
Did you know one oyster played both parts?

01:44.150 --> 01:46.750
Anyway, my new movie is even better.

01:46.790 --> 01:48.820
<i>Bananatar!</i>

01:50.160 --> 01:53.830
Uh-oh! One of your leads
refuses to work with you.

01:53.860 --> 01:56.160
She'll be in her trailer.
Also known as my stomach.

02:52.790 --> 02:53.990
Okay, class, listen up.

02:54.020 --> 02:58.020
I will be filling in since
your regular home ec teacher,

02:58.060 --> 03:00.830
Mrs. Nateman,
had her baby last night.

03:00.860 --> 03:04.800
So, she's at home "resting," or I like to call it "goofing off."

03:05.830 --> 03:07.000
We made a card.

03:07.030 --> 03:08.550
Would you like to sign it?

03:08.640 --> 03:12.800
No. Babies can't read.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.740
Instead of following nateman left, notes.

03:15.780 --> 03:18.810
We're gonna make things interesting.

03:18.840 --> 03:21.750
With a home ec face-off.

03:21.780 --> 03:24.060
Isn't that gonna hurt?

03:25.790 --> 03:29.690
We'll be competing and sewing, cooking and cleaning.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.090
So pair up.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.890
The winning couple will receive...

03:32.930 --> 03:35.760
A snowman made of donuts?

03:35.800 --> 03:37.800
No.
What's wrong with you?

03:41.030 --> 03:43.970
The winning team will
receive a $50 gift card.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.810
Hey, Olive, want to team up?

03:46.840 --> 03:49.010
Sure.
Interesting story about sewing.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.980
The threaded needle dates back
to central asia in 40,000 bc,

03:52.010 --> 03:54.950
When they were made out of
bone, antler, ivory, and wood.

03:54.980 --> 03:56.930
Fletcher, do you have a partner yet?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.660
Nope. Not at all.
No one.

04:00.850 --> 04:02.380
Terrific.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.720
Now no one decent will
be left to team up with.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.790
Not true, angel face.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.760
Oh, boy.

04:11.800 --> 04:15.870
This will be great practice for when
we're actually married in the future.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.100
Here's a save the date card.

04:19.070 --> 04:21.070
This is tomorrow!

04:24.840 --> 04:28.050
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
welcome you to a special screening.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.820
Of my latest fil <i>bananatar!</i>

04:32.790 --> 04:34.950
No bananas were harmed during
the making of this film.

04:34.990 --> 04:37.090
Except the one I used to
make this banana split.

04:39.060 --> 04:40.730
I'll hold that for you.

04:43.060 --> 04:46.060
And here we go.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.650
Cameron!
How could you do this?

05:07.690 --> 05:10.820
Sorry, I guess I put
the wrong video online.

05:10.860 --> 05:12.960
This is on the Internet?

05:14.690 --> 05:15.860
Here's your banana back.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.660
I don't eat fruit.

05:17.700 --> 05:18.930
Ugh!

05:21.770 --> 05:25.000
So, the first competition
is going to be sewing.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.910
Your assignment is to make a dress.

05:26.940 --> 05:29.740
Something stylish
and eye-catching.

05:29.780 --> 05:30.980
That I can wear to my niece's wedding.

05:31.010 --> 05:31.980
And steal focus from her.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.050
Wow.
You're really good at this.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.750
And I like that material.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.090
I have a shirt just like that.

05:45.990 --> 05:49.760
While you're at it, honey,
you mind sewing up my sock?

05:52.900 --> 05:55.830
Get that thing out of my
face before I cut it off.

05:55.870 --> 05:57.770
And reattach it to your forehead!

05:58.970 --> 06:00.710
You hear that, everyone?

06:00.740 --> 06:03.910
My wife's gonna be a surgeon.

06:03.940 --> 06:05.840
Hey.
Less talking and more sewing.

06:05.880 --> 06:09.850
And remember, I'm going to be
modeling your designs myself.

06:13.690 --> 06:14.850
Very funny.

06:19.690 --> 06:21.730
Why isn't she melting?

06:25.100 --> 06:27.700
A bacon dress?

06:27.730 --> 06:30.700
And you are sizzling!

06:30.740 --> 06:32.870
Why do I get the feeling this
is how Angus always sees me?

06:35.740 --> 06:38.910
Wow! Our dress really gives
you an hourglass figure.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.010
Hmm. I like it.

06:42.050 --> 06:45.780
It makes me look stylish and punctual.

06:45.820 --> 06:47.990
Paisley, Fletcher, you win round one.

06:53.890 --> 06:55.990
You two who made the witch's costume,

06:56.030 --> 06:59.760
You get an hour of detention, starting now!

07:08.010 --> 07:10.680
Hello?

07:10.710 --> 07:13.880
Hi. I'm calling about
a video you posted online.

07:13.910 --> 07:14.950
If this is t <i>avatar</i> people,

07:14.980 --> 07:17.880
I thought of <i>bananatar</i> first.

07:19.690 --> 07:22.050
I should be suing you.

07:22.090 --> 07:25.860
Actually, I'm calling about
the video of Chyna singing.

07:25.890 --> 07:29.990
I'm a music producer, and I think
she's got an awesome voice.

07:30.030 --> 07:32.060
I'd like to get in touch with her manager.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.000
Her manager?

07:34.030 --> 07:36.670
Well, actually...

07:36.700 --> 07:37.800
That would be me!

07:48.320 --> 07:51.690
I can't believe I'm actually
meeting with a music producer.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.490
This is so exciting!

07:53.520 --> 07:56.290
Well, just remember it was your manager.

07:56.330 --> 08:00.360
Who made it all happen for you, baby.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.010
No need to thank me.
I'll be fine with your 15%.

08:04.120 --> 08:07.330
- Ten percent.
- Five percent.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.950
Yeah, I'm not sure I want
you negotiating for me.

08:14.510 --> 08:17.480
Doorbell app.
Knocking's for chumps.

08:18.510 --> 08:22.450
The name's oswald,
but everyone calls me hippo.

08:22.490 --> 08:27.320
Oh! Because you dress super hip
and your name starts with an "o"?

08:27.360 --> 08:30.390
No, because I'm fat.

08:30.430 --> 08:34.500
And I like to sink down in the hot tub
with just my eyes showing like this.

08:36.570 --> 08:39.570
So, Cameron told me you like my song.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.299
Yeah.
I can't get it out of my head.

08:42.340 --> 08:45.340
<i>♪ tonight, I'm unstoppable ♪</i>

08:46.440 --> 08:47.640
Unstoppable!

08:47.680 --> 08:50.380
That's right.
Those are the lyrics.

08:50.410 --> 08:52.510
Some people think I'm saying "soccer ball,"

08:52.550 --> 08:54.650
But obviously
it's "unstoppable."

08:56.350 --> 08:59.250
So, should we talk video?

08:59.290 --> 09:01.220
Sure, but first, can I get
you something to drink?

09:01.260 --> 09:04.230
You got any gravy?

09:04.260 --> 09:06.260
Uh, no.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.430
It's okay.
I brought my own.

09:13.570 --> 09:15.370
Yeah?
Mmm-mmm.

09:18.270 --> 09:21.610
Round two of the competition,
cleaning skills.

09:21.640 --> 09:25.510
I want this floor so spotless I
can see my reflection in it.

09:25.550 --> 09:27.580
Ew! Why would you
want to see that?

09:27.620 --> 09:31.320
Just clean the room!

09:34.690 --> 09:35.520
Ugh!

09:35.560 --> 09:38.530
Why does this cleanser smell so bad?

09:38.560 --> 09:43.260
I don't know.
I grabbed it from the supply closet.

09:43.300 --> 09:44.400
That's a refrigerator.

09:48.470 --> 09:51.310
And this is parmesan cheese!

09:51.340 --> 09:53.640
Then what did I put on my spaghetti?

10:01.420 --> 10:03.490
Where is Angus?
He's supposed to be helping me.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.590
I'm here, honeypie.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.290
What the heck!

10:14.360 --> 10:17.330
Check out my industrial floor scrubber!

10:17.370 --> 10:18.500
Where did you get that?

10:18.530 --> 10:21.600
My parents said if I stopped
eating whole pizzas,

10:21.640 --> 10:23.440
They'd buy me anything I wanted.

10:23.470 --> 10:25.440
I asked for a pizza oven.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.640
This was my second choice.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.610
Angus, what do you think you're doing?

10:31.650 --> 10:36.550
Oh, my goodness, this floor is so clean!

10:36.590 --> 10:38.550
Thisound goes to Olive and Angus.

10:38.590 --> 10:39.390
What?

10:43.530 --> 10:46.390
Yes! We won!

10:46.430 --> 10:47.600
Okay.
Next round is cooking.

10:47.630 --> 10:51.300
Let's make pizzas.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.440
You know, I probably should
have put it in park.

10:58.570 --> 11:01.240
Get this off of me!

11:01.280 --> 11:04.450
Quick! Get her magic shoes
before her legs shrivel up!

11:15.260 --> 11:16.560
So, I downloaded that doorbell app.

11:17.660 --> 11:23.360
It cost 40 bucks, but it
was totally worth it.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.230
I made dad answer the door all morning.

11:29.510 --> 11:32.440
Knocking app.

11:32.470 --> 11:33.640
What happened to your doorbell app?

11:33.680 --> 11:38.550
Knocking's very in right now.
Doorbells are for chumps.

11:39.580 --> 11:41.620
Yeah. Totally.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.520
So, hippo, I want to talk
to you about my song.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.360
Yeah, yeah, we'll get to that.

11:48.390 --> 11:50.590
But I wanted to tell you
I changed your name.

11:50.630 --> 11:52.560
You're welcome.

11:52.600 --> 11:52.660
What?
Cool name!

11:54.660 --> 11:58.430
"you're welcome."

11:58.470 --> 12:01.440
It lets the fans know they're
welcome to come to her concerts,

12:01.470 --> 12:03.300
To buy t-shirts...

12:03.340 --> 12:06.570
Her name's not you're welcome.
That's stupid.

12:06.610 --> 12:08.440
Yeah, Cameron, that's stupid.

12:08.480 --> 12:08.740
Her name is string cheese.

12:08.780 --> 12:11.250
What?

12:12.480 --> 12:15.380
Okay, I don't think I want
to change my name.

12:15.420 --> 12:17.520
Can I have a word with my client?

12:19.590 --> 12:22.360
You need to chill out, string cheese.

12:22.390 --> 12:25.490
Let's remember what's important here.

12:25.530 --> 12:28.360
When opportunity uses a
knocking app, you answer.

12:30.300 --> 12:31.400
Maybe you're right.

12:31.430 --> 12:32.600
The music's what's important.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.500
Okay, can we talk about the song?

12:36.540 --> 12:37.670
Yup! It's done.

12:37.710 --> 12:42.510
I wrote this up in the tub last night.
Hippo-style.

12:44.350 --> 12:47.280
But, I worked on my song.

12:47.320 --> 12:49.580
Well, that was a waste of time.

12:49.620 --> 12:51.490
Yeah, that's what I told her.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.420
I said, "don't waste your
time, string cheese.

12:54.460 --> 12:56.360
"we're doing this
hippo-style."

12:59.360 --> 13:03.460
All right, blind my ears
with your throat lasers.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.570
What?

13:05.600 --> 13:09.500
Sing the song.
How much clearer could I have been?

13:09.540 --> 13:13.270
Okay, I guess I could give it a try.

13:13.310 --> 13:17.410
<i>♪ 11:58, and I'm</i>
<i>looking at the clock.</i>

13:17.450 --> 13:20.620
<i>♪ stomach's growling</i>
<i>like a zombie peacock ♪</i>

13:20.650 --> 13:23.420
I'm sorry, that can't be right.

13:23.450 --> 13:26.250
No, no. Keep going!
I'm feeling you!

13:26.290 --> 13:28.360
Yeah, feeling you!

13:31.360 --> 13:32.560
<i>♪ but now it's lunchtime</i>

13:32.590 --> 13:34.300
<i>♪ lunchtime</i>

13:34.330 --> 13:36.360
<i>♪ can't wait for lunchtime</i>

13:36.400 --> 13:41.240
<i>♪ it's the meal</i> <i>that comes
between</i> <i>brunch and linner ♪</i>

13:41.270 --> 13:44.440
Okay. So this whole
song's just about lunch?

13:44.470 --> 13:47.510
Yup. Second highest
testing meal of the day.

13:47.540 --> 13:51.580
I'm telling you, "lunchtime"
is going to be huge.

13:51.610 --> 13:53.480
We could win a gravy for this.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.520
You mean a grammy?

13:57.550 --> 14:00.230
Yeah, what did I say?

14:07.430 --> 14:09.600
There is my favorite client!

14:09.640 --> 14:12.470
Come on, I'm going to get
you to the shoot in style.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.340
Something bigger than a stretch limo.

14:15.370 --> 14:16.340
Is it the bus?

14:17.580 --> 14:19.540
Maybe.

14:21.580 --> 14:24.480
Look, Cameron.
I can't sing this "lunchtime" song.

14:24.520 --> 14:28.450
It's terrible.
Listen to these lyrics.

14:28.490 --> 14:32.420
<i>♪ lunch can be brown</i>
<i>lunch can be yella</i>

14:32.460 --> 14:36.330
<i>♪ I hope I don't get</i>
<i>salmonella ♪</i>

14:37.400 --> 14:39.460
What? That rhymes.

14:41.370 --> 14:43.530
Look, I understand you're nervous,

14:43.570 --> 14:46.400
But wait till you see the incredible
outfit you're going to wear.

14:53.350 --> 14:56.480
Huh?
What do you think?

14:56.680 --> 14:59.520
I think it's a little...

14:59.550 --> 15:02.290
Cheesy.

15:02.320 --> 15:06.320
Right. It's a string cheese
costume, string cheese.

15:07.460 --> 15:10.230
Forget it.
I am not doing the video.

15:10.260 --> 15:12.430
What?
You have to do it.

15:12.460 --> 15:14.470
If you don't show up, we're finished!

15:14.500 --> 15:16.470
People in the music business talk.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.270
I know hippo does.
He has a talking app.

15:21.370 --> 15:22.540
You mean a phone?

15:22.570 --> 15:23.240
Whatever!

15:26.450 --> 15:29.510
What about artistic integrity?

15:29.550 --> 15:31.580
That means nothing to me.

15:31.620 --> 15:36.350
I mean, seriously.
I literally have no idea what that means.

15:36.390 --> 15:38.290
It means I'm not selling out.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.260
Chyna, please.

15:40.290 --> 15:43.330
This is my one chance to
make something of myself.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.630
You've got a lot going for you.

15:44.660 --> 15:48.300
I don't.

15:48.330 --> 15:50.570
Come on, Cameron.
You have plenty going for you.

15:50.600 --> 15:54.310
Well, I do have a sister who loves me.

15:55.340 --> 15:56.440
Aw!

15:58.610 --> 16:00.340
Got you, string cheese!

16:00.380 --> 16:02.310
Now let's get on the bus!

16:02.350 --> 16:04.480
Forget it! There is no way
I am doing that video!

16:08.420 --> 16:10.450
Places, everyone!
Chyna, are you ready to go?

16:11.520 --> 16:13.360
Okay, then.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.190
"lunchtime," take one.
Playback!

16:16.230 --> 16:17.530
And action!

16:23.600 --> 16:27.200
<i>♪ 11:58 and I'm</i>
<i>looking at the clock</i>

16:27.240 --> 16:32.240
<i>♪ stomach's growling like</i>
<i>a zombie peacock</i>

16:32.280 --> 16:36.250
<i>♪ lunch can be brown</i>
<i>lunch can be yella... ♪</i>

16:36.280 --> 16:36.680
Round three, cooking.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.220
So, let's go.

16:39.250 --> 16:41.350
I get cranky when I'm hungry.

16:41.390 --> 16:43.390
You must be hungry all the time.

16:44.390 --> 16:46.460
Zip it.

16:46.490 --> 16:50.330
Okay, Angus, if we win this
round, we're the champs.

16:50.360 --> 16:54.200
So, I've got my garlic, my leeks, and...

16:54.230 --> 16:55.500
Where are my avocados?

16:55.530 --> 16:59.270
I don't know, but I think these
jelly donuts have gone bad.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.310
Give me that!

17:05.210 --> 17:09.450
Just so you know for when we're
married, I'll basically eat anything.

17:09.480 --> 17:13.319
Once I ate a fajita
I found on the sidewalk.

17:13.349 --> 17:15.220
At least, I think it was a fajita.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.460
Fajitas have feathers, right?

17:19.290 --> 17:21.460
Okay, our quiche is going to be incredible,

17:21.490 --> 17:24.130
Thanks to these fresh eggs
I got from my Uncle.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.300
Your Uncle lays eggs?

17:29.200 --> 17:31.790
No, he has a farm.

17:31.980 --> 17:33.440
Did you preheat the oven?

17:33.470 --> 17:36.410
Well, I tried, but I couldn't figure out.

17:36.440 --> 17:39.210
How to fit the oven in the microwave.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.480
Okay, let's get cracking.

17:46.550 --> 17:48.120
Well, that answers that question.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.420
The egg came first.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.220
Whoa.
I better check the other eggs.

17:56.330 --> 17:57.500
Where are the other eggs?

17:58.330 --> 18:01.300
Fletcher, what is going on here?

18:03.400 --> 18:07.240
Oh, no! They all hatched
and they're getting away!

18:07.270 --> 18:10.070
Well, Fletcher, it's not the first time

18:10.110 --> 18:12.280
I've seen chicks run away from you.

18:12.310 --> 18:13.410
Help me gather them!

18:13.450 --> 18:16.280
I've got one!

18:16.310 --> 18:19.220
Angus!
Don't put salt on that!

18:21.190 --> 18:23.220
My fajita!

18:24.290 --> 18:28.130
I got one back in!
But it may not work.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.160
This is duck tape.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.400
Do we have any chicken tape?

18:31.430 --> 18:34.270
Ah! I found one!

18:34.300 --> 18:35.330
Oh, great! Let me have it!

18:35.370 --> 18:37.230
It went inside my dress!

18:37.270 --> 18:39.170
Never mind.
You can keep it.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.310
Angus, Olive, you win,
because if nothing else,

18:41.340 --> 18:43.410
Your food did not climb into my clothing.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.340
Oh. Here's your gift card.

18:47.450 --> 18:50.110
But this is for a romantic dinner for two!

18:50.150 --> 18:52.120
Yes!

18:52.150 --> 18:53.420
Forget it.
You can eat by yourself.

18:54.490 --> 18:56.190
Yes!

18:59.390 --> 19:01.090
<i>♪ but now it's lunchtime</i>

19:09.100 --> 19:11.340
Cut!

19:11.370 --> 19:14.270
Why? Was there a problem
with the lighting?

19:16.240 --> 19:18.210
Cameron...

19:18.240 --> 19:21.210
Oh, I hate when fans dress
like me in Chyna costumes!

19:23.380 --> 19:26.120
I've thought about it, and
I'm willing to do the song.

19:26.150 --> 19:27.250
Clearly it's really,

19:27.290 --> 19:29.290
Really important to you.

19:31.190 --> 19:34.360
Thanks, Chyna.
I hope I didn't mess things up already.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.130
Look, I see what you're up to.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.330
You do?
Yeah.

19:37.360 --> 19:41.300
You did all this to show me
how ridiculous my song is.

19:41.330 --> 19:43.300
I did?

19:43.340 --> 19:45.340
Yup, and you're right.

19:45.370 --> 19:48.140
I mean, "string cheese"?

19:48.170 --> 19:49.310
I know I go through dozens of bags a day,

19:49.340 --> 19:53.480
But seeing you dance in that costume,

19:53.510 --> 19:56.180
Well, it actually made me lose my appetite.

19:56.210 --> 19:58.150
Me!

19:58.180 --> 20:00.180
Oh, wait, it's back.

20:02.220 --> 20:05.390
Anyway, I think we should do your song.

20:05.420 --> 20:07.220
Really?

20:07.260 --> 20:10.390
Yup. You've got yourself
quite a clever manager here.

20:11.300 --> 20:13.400
I do, don't I?

20:16.270 --> 20:17.430
I'd love to hear the other song.

20:17.470 --> 20:20.440
<i>♪ that's right</i>

22:36.270 --> 22:39.340
Wow!
That is a great song.

22:39.380 --> 22:43.280
Unfortunately, I just got a
text from my image consultant.

22:43.310 --> 22:45.380
Movies are very in right now.

22:45.420 --> 22:47.280
Music's for chumps.

22:48.590 --> 22:50.350
Do something, manager!

22:50.390 --> 22:51.490
I'm on it.

22:51.520 --> 22:55.560
So, you're looking to invest in a film?

22:55.590 --> 22:57.330
I got something...

23:01.300 --> 23:03.100
