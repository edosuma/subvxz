07:35.498 --> 07:37.718
that this family
is filled with love.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.807
-What are we doing
with the floors?
-Okay.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.678
'Cause these are
the old-school terrazzo.

07:41.722 --> 07:42.984
I love terrazzo,

07:43.027 --> 07:44.812
but we could put
new floors on top of it

07:44.855 --> 07:46.509
or we could leave it as is.

07:46.553 --> 07:47.858
-It's up to you.
-I'm gonna leave that
up to you.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.207
Oh... wait, what?

07:49.251 --> 07:50.905
[softly]:
Can you tell him that?

07:50.948 --> 07:53.037
Shaq's mom is counting
on me to deliver

07:53.081 --> 07:54.691
and I will not let her down.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.345
In the living room
and dining room,

07:56.388 --> 07:57.694
we'll clean everything out.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.914
And then I will cover
the terrazzo

07:59.957 --> 08:02.482
with all-new
luxury vinyl flooring.

08:02.525 --> 08:05.310
And then, I will add
all-new stylish furniture,

08:05.354 --> 08:08.009
paint, lighting
and beautiful artwork

08:08.052 --> 08:11.708
to bring these spaces
out of the 1980s.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.536
And I'll reorganize
and highlight

08:13.580 --> 08:16.060
the best family photos
into new frames

08:16.104 --> 08:18.062
and spread the rest of them
throughout the house,

08:18.106 --> 08:20.543
which Uncle Roy will love.

08:20.587 --> 08:24.025
You know, your uncle
is a self-made musician,

08:24.068 --> 08:26.027
so this is his music room,

08:26.070 --> 08:29.857
his office and his all-purpose

08:29.900 --> 08:31.728
gathering place
when he wants to do

08:31.772 --> 08:33.077
-a concert as well.
-ROB: Sabrina, what about

08:33.121 --> 08:34.861
opening up
this whole closet area?

08:34.905 --> 08:36.037
-'Cause it's kind of
tight in here.
-Yes, yes.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.385
It needs a couple guitars

08:37.429 --> 08:38.518
and needs everything
music-related.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.040
ROB:
I'm starting to realize

08:40.084 --> 08:42.390
Shaquille doesn't do
anything small.

08:42.433 --> 08:43.784
-SABRINA: No.
-ROB: Everything's big.
-NISCHELLE: You think?

08:43.827 --> 08:44.828
You hear that?
[imitates water bubbling]

08:44.872 --> 08:46.134
-[Rob laughing]
-Okay.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.049
That's the hot tub sound.
[laughing]

08:48.092 --> 08:50.094
SABRINA:
In this cluttered office,

08:50.138 --> 08:52.619
we'll rip out the old
wood paneling and carpeting

08:52.662 --> 08:55.143
and bring in
new floors and lighting.

08:55.186 --> 08:58.538
We are not going to be putting
a Shaq-inspired hot tub in here,

08:58.581 --> 09:01.671
but we will replace the closet
Uncle Roy doesn't need

09:01.715 --> 09:04.326
with a dedicated
music composing area

09:04.369 --> 09:05.762
he is never gonna want to leave.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.285
With a new table
for his keyboard,

09:07.329 --> 09:09.287
a new microphone setup

09:09.331 --> 09:12.682
and the acoustic foam panels
every recording studio has.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.293
-SABRINA:
Kitchen's a little cramped.
-ROB: Mm.

09:15.337 --> 09:18.601
LUCILLE:
I would like to see
some more modern cabinets.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.125
I'd like to see this
look-look like marble.

09:21.169 --> 09:23.301
-SABRINA: Okay.
-LUCILLE: It doesn't have
to be real marble.

09:23.345 --> 09:25.695
SABRINA:
Ms. Lucille definitely knows
what Uncle Roy likes.

09:25.739 --> 09:29.003
So after we give this
galley kitchen a total gut job,

09:29.046 --> 09:31.353
we will put in
new floors and paint,

09:31.396 --> 09:34.312
new cabinets,
beautiful marble countertops,

09:34.356 --> 09:36.184
and all stainless steel
appliances

09:36.227 --> 09:38.229
that are going to look
great in here.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.231
We'll pick a fridge
that is at counter depth

09:40.275 --> 09:42.756
to give Uncle Roy a little
more space to move around.

09:42.799 --> 09:45.540
And we'll replace
the clunky pantry closet

09:45.585 --> 09:47.891
with a better
floor-to-ceiling cabinet.

09:47.935 --> 09:49.893
All right,
let's take a look in here.

09:49.937 --> 09:52.417
-All right.
-Wow.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.463
-Okay.
-NISCHELLE: This is a big
laundry room.

09:54.506 --> 09:58.075
This is big, but look at--
the car's right here.

09:58.119 --> 09:59.990
NISCHELLE:
This is huge.
This garage is huge.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.731
ROB:
It is a big garage.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.037
-I mean, it's a little bit...
-[Sabrina gasps]

10:03.080 --> 10:05.169
To have all of this
as a workspace,

10:05.213 --> 10:06.867
that's like my dream come true.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.738
When I open that door, I hear...
[imitates bubbling]

10:08.782 --> 10:10.479
[laughing]

10:10.522 --> 10:13.830
ROB:
Uncle Roy loves
doing DIY projects,

10:13.874 --> 10:15.702
so I'll convert
a portion of his garage

10:15.745 --> 10:17.442
into a professional workshop.

10:17.486 --> 10:19.357
First, we'll give the garage

10:19.401 --> 10:21.577
a facelift
with new garage doors,

10:21.621 --> 10:23.840
epoxy flooring and paint.

10:23.884 --> 10:26.538
And then I'll bring in
tons of new cabinets

10:26.582 --> 10:28.149
for all his tools

10:28.192 --> 10:30.194
and a corner work table
he is going to love.

10:30.238 --> 10:33.676
And then I'm also going to
renovate his laundry room.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.809
And in the process,
I'll move the door

10:35.852 --> 10:38.681
that is right against the car
to the end of the room,

10:38.725 --> 10:41.379
so he can walk
straight into his man cave.

10:41.423 --> 10:44.992
And since Shaq just will not
let go of this hot tub idea,

10:45.035 --> 10:47.081
Sabrina and I will go
pick one up.

10:47.124 --> 10:51.433
We'll install it in the backyard
as a total surprise to Shaq.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.522
LUCILLE:
He loves his cars.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.567
-Hold on,
it's the same car he had?
-Yes.

10:55.611 --> 10:56.830
How many miles he got on this?

10:56.873 --> 10:59.528
200,000 or more, yes.

10:59.571 --> 11:00.616
I need your permission.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.270
I need to buy him a new car.

11:02.313 --> 11:03.706
You have my permission.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.665
-Yay!
-Oh, boy.
-Wait, what?

11:05.708 --> 11:07.579
Uncle Roy is getting...

11:07.623 --> 11:09.016
A supersized celebrity,

11:09.059 --> 11:10.974
one of the biggest renovations
we've ever done,

11:11.018 --> 11:12.541
and a new car?

11:12.584 --> 11:15.631
This is shaping up to be
an epic reveal...

11:15.675 --> 11:17.894
if we can get it done
in the two weeks we have.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.722
You guys have
a lot of work to do.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.202
-What, painting and stuff?
-Yeah.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.639
-[knocks]
-Aah!

11:23.683 --> 11:26.337
-[laughing]
-[Shaq groaning]

11:26.381 --> 11:28.122
-Come on, now.
-My arthritis just kicked in.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.906
[laughing]

11:29.950 --> 11:31.865
-Let's get started.
-Yeah, I got to take
Ms. Lucille.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.214
-Okay.
-'Cause you and I, we got
some stuff to plan, okay?

11:33.257 --> 11:34.650
-Okay, I'm ready.
-All right.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.999
All right.
You guys have a good time.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.740
-All right.
-Where are we starting anyway?

11:37.784 --> 11:38.610
-We're gonna start
in the front.
-Okay.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.700
Rob, boxes right up there.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.484
Come on, Shaquille, get in here.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.094
On your marks, get set, go.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.443
Get 'em, Sabrina, go.

11:45.487 --> 11:46.923
-Sabrina, go, go, go.
-I am done!

11:46.967 --> 11:47.663
-Sabrina, go, go, go!
-ROB: Look at him.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.360
He's cheerleading.

11:49.404 --> 11:52.015
Uh-oh, I think joking around
with Shaq about making him

11:52.059 --> 11:54.583
do all the hard work
has backfired.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.106
I'm gonna go
on my little snack break.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.848
-No snack break yet.
-Rob, hand me a knife.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.241
-We just started.
-I know, I just...

12:00.284 --> 12:01.677
I'm-I'm gonna help you
with it, Sabrina.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.634
I mean, he's hungry.
Let him have...

12:02.678 --> 12:03.940
Let him have a little something.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.986
I'm a big man.
My sugar level's low.

12:06.029 --> 12:06.900
Watch this now.
One bite of this and I...

12:08.945 --> 12:11.339
ROB:
Here it is!
Look at him go.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.428
Look at him go!

12:13.471 --> 12:15.473
-SABRINA: Who knew
it was that easy?
-I mean, look at that.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.606
All I need is some sugar,
Sabrina.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.913
-You better get some more
food for tomorrow, Sabrina.
-Okay, check.

12:19.956 --> 12:23.481
Apparently, the answer is just
a little bit of pound cake.

12:23.525 --> 12:24.831
I want you to see
what Shaq does.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.267
ROB:
Look at this.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.095
-Look at Shaq's section...
-[Rob laughs]

12:28.138 --> 12:29.879
...and look at Rob's section.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.663
ROB:
Well, we're done packing.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.404
Now it's time to take it down.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.493
When I was in the NBA,
I used to tear stuff up,

12:35.537 --> 12:37.800
so I'm used to demolition.

12:37.844 --> 12:40.716
I have to put these
bad boys on right here,

12:40.760 --> 12:42.283
and just tear some stuff up.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.328
-Watch out, little man.
-[Sabrina laughs]

12:44.372 --> 12:45.373
My man.
Push it forward.

12:45.415 --> 12:46.940
There you go.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.855
-SABRINA: Oh, wow.
-What else you need?

12:48.898 --> 12:50.117
Right here. Dishwasher.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.902
-All right.
-Oh, this is easy.

12:52.946 --> 12:54.817
Shaq, if the...
if the other things

12:54.861 --> 12:56.079
-don't work out, bud...
-Shh, I'm working.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.212
I'm working right now.
Leave me alone.

12:59.474 --> 13:02.259
-SABRINA: Whoa!
-ROB: I'll tell you what.

13:02.303 --> 13:03.391
You're hired.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.567
I am in shock.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.743
SHAQ:
You'll be shocked.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.658
Just had to test my strength.
See, it's all about...

13:09.701 --> 13:11.442
[inhaling]
See? When I do that...

13:11.486 --> 13:14.576
and I just summon it,
it just... it just comes.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.317
It just, you know, releases.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.145
-Let me get you a hammer.
-[Sabrina gasps]

13:18.188 --> 13:19.363
ALL:
Oh!

13:19.407 --> 13:20.582
[Rob laughing]

13:20.625 --> 13:21.801
This is for you, Uncle Roy.

13:23.585 --> 13:26.762
I am The Black Thor.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.809
-Swing my mighty hammer.
-[Rob laughing]

13:29.852 --> 13:31.549
Always been a superhero,
America.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.334
You just didn't notice it.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.336
But I see you notice it now.

13:35.379 --> 13:38.556
-ROB: Hit it hard!
-I hate you, Charles Barkley.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.558
-ROB: Hit it hard!
-Barkley sucks.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.125
-ROB: Man...
-Barkley sucks!

13:42.169 --> 13:43.779
This is not what I do, America.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.608
I appreciate all you guys
that do hard work.

13:46.651 --> 13:48.218
Love you for that, but...

13:48.262 --> 13:51.091
I haven't done manual labor
like this in 25 years.

13:51.134 --> 13:52.832
I think we got a lot done.
We got a good start.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.181
-Okay.
-Let's take a break.

13:54.224 --> 13:55.269
Let's go look
and see the office.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.010
-Yeah.
-Okay?

13:57.053 --> 13:58.489
All right.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.056
-All right.
-I'll meet you guys over there.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.667
I'm right behind you.
All right.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.452
-ROB: Hey, hey, hey.
-Yeah, yeah, I'll see you
in a few minutes.

14:04.495 --> 14:05.496
ROB:
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

14:05.540 --> 14:07.672
I think we lost him.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.198
I can get used to this, Shaq.

14:11.241 --> 14:14.070
NISCHELLE:
With Shaq in the house, Rob
and Sabrina are on easy street.

14:14.114 --> 14:16.594
ROB:
This looks good.
You're doing a great job.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.205
NISCHELLE:
And later...

14:18.248 --> 14:19.815
Uncle Shaq's in the building.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.990
-SHAQ: What's up?
-NISCHELLE: I take Shaquille

14:21.034 --> 14:23.210
on a trip down memory lane.

14:23.253 --> 14:26.039
And everywhere he goes,
he gives, gives, gives...

14:26.082 --> 14:27.649
-NISCHELLE: $10,000.
-[cheering]

14:27.692 --> 14:28.868
...even when he doesn't mean to.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.000
SHAQ:
We got 36 people here.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.306
I'm gonna let
three people shoot.

14:32.349 --> 14:33.873
And if one of y'all
hit a half-court shot,

14:33.915 --> 14:36.266
I'll bring back
36 Apple laptops.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.660
[cheering]

14:38.703 --> 14:40.270
[whooping]

14:40.314 --> 14:41.837
NISCHELLE:
Katie!

14:41.881 --> 14:43.708
[students cheering]

14:50.890 --> 14:52.848
NISCHELLE: NBA Hall of Famer
Shaquille O'Neal is back

14:52.892 --> 14:55.895
in the magic city of Orlando,
Florida for the next two weeks

14:55.938 --> 14:59.289
renovating the home of
his Uncle Roy to say thank you

14:59.333 --> 15:01.248
for helping to raise him
and supporting him

15:01.291 --> 15:03.641
when he was drafted number one
by the Orlando Magic

15:03.685 --> 15:05.774
more than 30 years ago.

15:07.341 --> 15:11.867
SHAQ:
Roy O'Neal is my mother's
older brother.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.174
He was the father figure
before--

15:14.217 --> 15:15.697
I don't like using
the term stepfather--

15:15.740 --> 15:17.699
but before my father,
Phillip Harrison,

15:17.742 --> 15:19.266
entered the picture.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.964
You know, every man child
needs a man in their life.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.835
-Agreed.

the hospital when Shaquille...

-When I delivered Shaquille.

I want to become.

15:42.115 --> 15:44.334
never asked for
anything in return.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.075
And I'm a family guy,

15:46.119 --> 15:48.338

I called everybody anyway.

let's go to the dealership."

his keep in demo,

into shape.

18:42.338 --> 18:45.124

professional storage cabinets

18:48.170 --> 18:49.737

19:08.799 --> 19:12.803
with great-looking new

39:44.730 --> 39:47.254
Look at that, the co-- Oh, man.

39:47.297 --> 39:50.692
I walked into the garage,
and it was absolutely beautiful.

39:50.736 --> 39:53.260
And I was in total disbelief.

39:53.303 --> 39:55.523
This is like a hideout space.

39:55.567 --> 39:58.004
NISCHELLE:
He's like a kid on Christmas.

39:58.047 --> 39:59.527
He has everything
that he needs in the garage.

39:59.571 --> 40:00.920
I know he was surprised
about that.

40:00.963 --> 40:03.183
Oh, I got space for my tools.

40:03.226 --> 40:05.011
SHAQ:
This is nice.

40:05.054 --> 40:06.578
You know what, Uncle Roy?

40:06.621 --> 40:08.057
I ain't even got this
in my house.

40:08.101 --> 40:09.537
NISCHELLE:
They really wanted to create

40:09.581 --> 40:12.148
and turn that
into a master workspace.

40:12.192 --> 40:13.759
I'm going to show you
a magic trick.

40:13.802 --> 40:15.761
I'm going to go in here,
and when they close the door,

40:15.804 --> 40:17.719
you count to three,
I'm gonna be outside.

40:17.763 --> 40:18.981
Don't, don't worry about it.

40:19.025 --> 40:20.853
I've always been magic
like this.

40:20.896 --> 40:22.463
-NISCHELLE: Oh, here he goes.
-Oh, you don't believe me?

40:22.507 --> 40:25.161
-No, I believe you, sir.
-Okay, so I'm gonna go in here.

40:25.205 --> 40:27.860
-Close the door...
-Criss Angel who?

40:27.903 --> 40:29.992
-David Blaine who?
-Count to five, close the door.

40:30.036 --> 40:31.777
Start counting.

40:31.820 --> 40:33.039
-All right.
-BOTH: One.

40:33.082 --> 40:34.649
NISCHELLE:
Two.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.304
-Three!
-I am, I am Kazaam.

40:37.347 --> 40:38.784
-Remember that movie?
-Yes.

40:38.827 --> 40:40.742
You like that trick, Uncle Roy?

40:40.786 --> 40:42.483
Let-let me do the honors.

40:44.006 --> 40:46.400
Uncle Roy?

40:46.444 --> 40:49.098
The royal hot tub is ready,
my brother.

40:49.142 --> 40:51.231
-Ah!
-Yeah! [laughing]

40:51.274 --> 40:53.581
-Yeah!
-Oh!

40:53.625 --> 40:55.540
-The royal hot tub is ready.
-NISCHELLE: Wait a minute,
did you see this?

40:55.583 --> 40:57.759
What?

40:57.803 --> 40:59.674
-NISCHELLE: Your name's on it.
-ROY: Oh!

40:59.718 --> 41:01.763
Okay, okay.

41:01.807 --> 41:03.591
Yeah.

41:03.635 --> 41:06.420
That was a great addition
to the house, the hot tub.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.596
We just left the garage and
asked where your car was at.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.425
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where is the car?

41:11.469 --> 41:13.819
You want to see another
magic trick? Follow me.

41:13.862 --> 41:15.908
This one's gonna be good. Just
follow me. Come on, follow me.

41:15.951 --> 41:18.040
You don't have Shaquille O'Neal
doing an episode

41:18.084 --> 41:21.130
of Secret Celebrity Renovation
and not expect it to be

41:21.174 --> 41:23.219
bigger and better

41:23.263 --> 41:25.657
and badder than anything
you've ever seen.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.659
I mean,
he doesn't do anything small.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.270
-What?
-Whoa!

41:30.313 --> 41:33.186
-ROY: Whoa!
-How do you like that trick?

41:33.229 --> 41:35.014
Whoa.

41:35.057 --> 41:36.145
Ta-da!

41:36.189 --> 41:38.626
ROY:
You mean that's for me, too?

41:38.670 --> 41:40.933
-Uh, it sure is.
-Absolutely beautiful.

41:40.976 --> 41:42.282
-Look at this.
-Look at it.

41:42.325 --> 41:43.849
Isn't it beautiful?

41:43.892 --> 41:44.806
-She picked out the color.
-Absolutely beautiful.

41:44.850 --> 41:46.242
Here you go, man.

41:46.286 --> 41:49.898
Shaquille is a very warm
and generous individual.

41:49.942 --> 41:52.118
What, uh, what is the...

41:52.161 --> 41:53.685
the name of the color,
what is it?

41:53.728 --> 41:54.424
-Money green?
-SABRINA: It's money green.

41:54.468 --> 41:55.687
Oh, that'll work.

41:55.730 --> 41:57.732
[laughter, clamoring]

41:57.776 --> 41:59.125
That'll work.
Yeah, that'll work.

41:59.168 --> 42:01.693
Just joy, just joy.

42:01.736 --> 42:04.260
Joy, gladness. Just joy.

42:04.304 --> 42:06.088
You ever need anything, you know
you can call me, brother.

42:06.132 --> 42:07.742
You know you got that, so...

42:07.786 --> 42:09.396
we wanted to hook
everything up for you.

42:09.439 --> 42:11.703
I'm happy. He's happy.
My mom's happy.

42:11.746 --> 42:13.400
This is probably
one of the best things

42:13.443 --> 42:15.489
I've done in my life,
and I've done a lot.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.883
-Much love to you, man.
-Rob, Sabrina, you know...

42:17.926 --> 42:19.580
Love you, love you.

42:19.624 --> 42:21.495
First of all,
he was the first born.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.105
Shaquille was the first born.

42:23.149 --> 42:24.846
-Love you.
-I love you, too.

42:24.890 --> 42:26.848
But he's also the kind of person

42:26.892 --> 42:29.938
that he
likes to share what he has.

42:29.982 --> 42:33.115
And I think that comes
from being around his mother.

42:33.159 --> 42:35.901
I want to thank Shaquille
for everything that he's done.

42:35.944 --> 42:37.555
And I love him very, very much.
