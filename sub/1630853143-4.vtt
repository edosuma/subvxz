WEBVTT

00:19.978 --> 00:21.980
[guests chattering]

00:32.365 --> 00:33.241
Is that her?

00:33.324 --> 00:36.578
The incomparable
who captured the prince's eye.

00:36.661 --> 00:39.247
A mere wisp of a young lady,
and a commoner at that.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.628
Everyone seems to have quite an opinion.
[chuckles]

00:46.963 --> 00:49.257
How long do you think it will be
before Her Majesty arrives?

00:49.340 --> 00:51.468
I may very well faint from hunger.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.806
Mama! We are at court!

00:56.890 --> 00:58.850
No one is looking at me, dearest.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.268
Mama!

01:00.351 --> 01:02.520
That's quite delicious. [laughs]

01:04.064 --> 01:05.774
My darling, you seem a little strained.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.692
You have been that way
for the past few days.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.736
-I have much on my mind.
-You do, indeed.

01:09.819 --> 01:10.904
[doors open]

01:11.446 --> 01:13.073
Her Majesty Queen Charlotte

01:13.156 --> 01:16.242
and her esteemed nephew,
Prince Friedrich of Prussia.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.869
[regal music plays]

01:25.794 --> 01:28.797
Miss Bridgerton, I find myself in raptures

01:28.880 --> 01:31.674
over your acceptance
of my invitation to the palace.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.593
You flatter me, Your Highness.

01:33.676 --> 01:36.221
I cannot help it.
You are perfection itself.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.472
Offer her your gift.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.225
I have brought you a gift.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.311
[exclaims softly]

01:43.394 --> 01:45.271
[guests gasp, murmur]

01:53.279 --> 01:54.697
[mournful piano music plays]

02:00.328 --> 02:02.330
[Daphne sighs, echoing]

02:08.711 --> 02:10.213
[Daphne gasps]

02:11.047 --> 02:12.382
Miss Bridgerton, are you unwell?

02:13.967 --> 02:17.178
I am perfectly well. Of course.
[breathes tremulously]

02:17.262 --> 02:18.680
This necklace is…

02:19.639 --> 02:20.890
quite well too.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.059
She will make a lovely princess,
will she not?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.602
Of course, Your Majesty.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.063
[chuckles softly]

02:35.405 --> 02:38.158
[Lady Whistledown]
In a town filled with ambitious mamas

02:38.241 --> 02:40.368
and fortune-hunting gentlemen,

02:40.869 --> 02:43.872
marrying above one's station
is an art form, indeed.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.584
But Miss Daphne Bridgerton's advance

02:47.667 --> 02:50.545
from future duchess to possible princess

02:50.628 --> 02:54.924
is an achievement
that even this jaded author must applaud.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.428
Is it true?
Am I to be the sister of a princess?

02:58.511 --> 02:59.554
Calm yourself.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.556
I am not yet engaged to the prince.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.224
Will you have to wear a crown?

03:03.308 --> 03:06.769
Perhaps for special occasions,
but only if I should marry the prince.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.688
-Will you have to learn Prussian?
-It is German.

03:08.771 --> 03:11.441
And perhaps,
but only if I should marry the prince.

03:11.524 --> 03:14.402
Will you have to move
to a castle far, far away?

03:14.485 --> 03:16.571
Should you not be off somewhere
with your governess?

03:16.654 --> 03:20.366
I should. My governess has
the very same questions as me!

03:21.618 --> 03:22.493
[sighs sharply]

03:22.577 --> 03:25.205
[Lady Whistledown]
Though this author cannot dismiss

03:25.288 --> 03:27.248
the Duke of Hastings quite so soon.

03:28.124 --> 03:31.961
He may have let the diamond
slip through his fingers for now,

03:32.045 --> 03:36.382
but I shall wager he is not a man
to ever hide from a fight.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.471
[Simon grunting rapidly]

03:46.559 --> 03:48.394
Does that sack of grain
have a German accent,

03:48.478 --> 03:50.104
or is it my imagination?

03:50.188 --> 03:51.022
Remind me, Will…

03:51.940 --> 03:54.692
are you participating
in a boxing exhibition today,

03:54.776 --> 03:56.361
or is it a comedy exhibition?

03:56.444 --> 03:58.446
-I was afraid you had forgotten.
-I had not.

03:58.529 --> 04:01.491
Although I am afraid
you will have to soldier on

04:01.574 --> 04:03.618
without your greatest admirer present
this afternoon.

04:03.701 --> 04:05.119
Alice will be present.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.580
I am leaving England. [panting]

04:08.373 --> 04:09.540
My business is concluded.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.001
Will's is not.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.753
This will be
the biggest match of my career.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.380
-I am not favored to win it.
-Will--

04:15.463 --> 04:17.465
Your smart friends know
you frequent my saloon.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.592
Who will wager on me
if you are not present?

04:20.218 --> 04:21.844
I don't have any friends.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.596
How about after the Irishman today, Will,

04:23.680 --> 04:26.015
you pummel the piss
out of His Grace's self-pity?

04:26.891 --> 04:29.644
I have never asked a favor,
but I implore you not to miss this match.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.271
His Grace would like to miss

04:31.354 --> 04:34.190
the chance of seeing the Bridgerton girl
on the arm of a prince.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.441
Perhaps you're right.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.360
Both of you understand
I am just here, do you?

04:37.860 --> 04:39.654
I am not nearly as devoted
as the two of you,

04:39.737 --> 04:41.781
along with Lady Whistledown,
would like to believe.

04:41.864 --> 04:44.951
The only thing we are devoted to
is putting food in our children's mouths.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.578
Perhaps you'd like to dig
a little deeper today, Your Grace,

04:47.662 --> 04:49.789
and help us fatten
the match organizer's purses

04:49.872 --> 04:50.707
as well as ours?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.209
What?

04:53.876 --> 04:55.586
You don't love me for my subtlety.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.675
[Simon sighs]

05:00.758 --> 05:01.843
[horse neighing]

05:12.186 --> 05:13.104
[grunts]

05:13.896 --> 05:15.523
Her needlework is divine.

05:15.606 --> 05:19.527
And, of course, she sings
and plays the pianoforte very prettily.

05:19.610 --> 05:20.737
Show me a smile, girl.

05:21.529 --> 05:22.572
I beg your pardon?

05:22.655 --> 05:24.574
Your teeth, I want to see them.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.159
Is she simpleminded?

05:26.242 --> 05:28.494
Goodness, no! Oh, you are droll!

05:28.578 --> 05:31.998
Miss Thompson, um,
show Lord Rutledge your lovely smile.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.001
-Miss Thompson?
-[Rutledge grunts]

05:36.836 --> 05:38.838
Tell a lot from a person's mouth.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.716
Soldiers' teeth.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.176
Taken from the battlefield.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.470
Cost a pretty penny, let me tell you.

05:46.220 --> 05:50.224
I shall try her out in company,

05:51.225 --> 05:53.895
see how she acquits herself.

05:53.978 --> 05:54.896
Of course.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.732
We will be attending the Trowbridge ball
this evening, naturally.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.150
Oh, very well.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.277
Good day, Featherington.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.279
Rutledge.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.323
You cannot be serious.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.909
How dare you conduct yourself
in such brazen manner?

06:07.992 --> 06:11.079
-Do you see now what I must endure daily?
-[Lord Featherington] Mm.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.790
I have had suitors calling on me
every morning this week.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.792
If you think
I'm going to marry that vile old--

06:15.875 --> 06:19.712
Those suitors are courting you, my dear.
That could take weeks, months.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.715
Even if a miracle occurred,
and one of them married you tomorrow,

06:22.799 --> 06:24.801
how do you imagine
they would react six months hence

06:24.884 --> 06:28.304
when that whelp of yours pops out
looking the picture of health?

06:28.388 --> 06:30.264
Lord Rutledge is in want of an heir.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.350
He will not ask questions.

06:33.768 --> 06:34.769
[Marina huffs]

06:36.437 --> 06:38.940
-[scoffs] She pushed me!
-No, she pushed me.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.442
Hush, both of you! My nerves!

06:47.240 --> 06:48.116
Marina?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.452
Would you like me to stay in?

06:56.707 --> 06:57.959
Kindly remind me, my lord,

06:58.042 --> 07:01.546
why we cannot simply send Miss Thompson
back to her father in the country?

07:01.629 --> 07:03.131
The matter is not for discussion.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.758
A gentleman caller. Mr. Albion Finch.

07:11.347 --> 07:12.598
Good day. [sneezes]

07:13.891 --> 07:17.812
[gasps] Daisies always trouble my nose.

07:17.895 --> 07:20.022
Miss Thompson is not receiving visitors,
Mr. Finch.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.607
That is quite all right.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.943
I am here to call on Miss Featherington.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.865
Miss Philippa Featherington?

07:28.948 --> 07:30.283
[exhales nervously]

07:41.461 --> 07:42.295
Thank you, sir.

07:43.671 --> 07:44.714
[chuckles]

07:44.797 --> 07:46.090
[exhales contentedly]

07:47.133 --> 07:50.887
I have never understood
the fashion for feathers in the hair.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.890
Why would a woman want to draw notice
to the fact that she is like a bird

07:53.973 --> 07:56.684
squawking for a man's attention
in some bizarre ritual?

07:56.767 --> 07:58.102
Then why are we looking?

07:58.186 --> 08:01.063
Because I would rather do anything
than stay a moment longer in that house

08:01.147 --> 08:03.983
while everyone flutters around Daphne,
cooing over her prospects.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.986
Is the prince still courting? I imagine
you cannot wait for the engagement.

08:07.069 --> 08:09.572
Pen, once they are engaged,
I shall be next in line.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.824
If anything,
I hope Daphne stays on the shelf forever.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.409
She must marry eventually.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.411
Why must our only options be

08:15.495 --> 08:17.788
to squawk and settle
or to never leave the nest?

08:17.872 --> 08:19.999
What if I want to fly?

08:20.958 --> 08:22.793
[scoffs] You know who is flying?

08:22.877 --> 08:25.338
Lady Whistledown. She is up in the sky.

08:25.421 --> 08:28.132
A brilliant woman of business
who fools the entire ton,

08:28.216 --> 08:29.842
whilst pocketing their money.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.511
Imagine the life she must lead.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.803
Independence.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.265
She is not simpering
on the edge of a ballroom every night,

08:36.349 --> 08:39.101
praying a man might take a fancy
and leg-shackle her into marriage.

08:39.185 --> 08:41.437
That is quite the life
you have imagined for her.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.732
We must meet her
so that she might share her secrets

08:44.815 --> 08:47.276
on how to avoid such a wretched,
uninteresting fate.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.487
Lady Whistledown's identity
is quite protected.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.489
Are we not the two most clever girls
in the ton?

08:51.572 --> 08:53.533
If anyone can find her, it is us, I think.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.911
If I could get out of any
of the week's events to help you, I would.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.121
Pretend an illness.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.582
Tell your mother
you caught whatever Marina had.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.418
-How is she, by the way?
-Uh, recovering.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.671
But it would be cruel of me

09:06.754 --> 09:09.090
not to be by her side
when she comes back out.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.342
I shall cheer you on
in your endeavors, though.

09:11.425 --> 09:13.135
This one. I shall need a new quill

09:13.219 --> 09:14.637
to make my list of suspects.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.222
Ooh! Thank you.

09:17.598 --> 09:18.641
[attendees clamoring]

09:18.724 --> 09:20.851
[bookkeeper] Come on, then!
Is it Mondrich or Gillespie?

09:20.935 --> 09:22.103
Thank you, sir!

09:24.897 --> 09:27.608
[Daphne] If Mama knew
I were here, of all places…

09:27.692 --> 09:30.194
[Anthony] Trust she would have
more to say to me than you.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.033
There's your prince now.
With your fancy well in hand,

09:36.117 --> 09:38.411
I shall make myself scarce
for the final blow.

09:41.914 --> 09:45.251
Miss Bridgerton, I am delighted
to see you here today, though surprised.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.504
Though I asked your brother to bring you
so we could spend some time together,

09:48.588 --> 09:50.089
I admit I did not hold much hope.

09:50.172 --> 09:53.968
Most ladies I have met cannot seem
to reconcile their delicate sensibilities

09:54.051 --> 09:55.219
with the brutality of fights.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.805
You must have no sisters, Your Highness,

09:57.888 --> 10:00.141
if you think most women delicate and mild.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.102
A trip to the modiste
during a silk shortage

10:03.185 --> 10:05.354
would disabuse you
of such notions for good.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.647
[both chuckle]

10:06.731 --> 10:08.899
I suppose I have much to learn, then.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.819
I would appreciate your expert tutelage
if you would join me.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.156
[mournful music plays]

10:16.032 --> 10:17.033
Miss Bridgerton?

10:18.159 --> 10:20.494
Of course. I would be delighted.

10:23.539 --> 10:26.500
Tell us, Mr. Mondrich, is it true
you've been training with the duke?

10:26.584 --> 10:29.170
Let us not exaggerate my role.
I am a mere pupil.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.422
-Target practice, at best.
-[Will] His Grace is modest.

10:31.505 --> 10:34.258
He's one of the least pitiful students
I have ever trained.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.259
[men laughing]

10:36.010 --> 10:38.763
[Will] You'd do well following his lead
and wagering on me today.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.306
Is that not right, Hastings?

10:42.308 --> 10:44.393
-Hastings?
-Of course.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.438
Our underdog, Mr. Mondrich,
shall emerge victorious.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.899
I, for one,
have 40 shillings on Mr. Gillespie.

10:49.982 --> 10:52.151
After all, he is the prince's man.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.488
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats!

10:55.571 --> 10:57.281
-The match is to begin!
-[bell rings]

10:58.157 --> 10:59.367
[crowd cheering, jeering]

10:59.867 --> 11:00.868
[Simon] Watch him!

11:04.121 --> 11:05.498
[crowd exclaims]

11:06.666 --> 11:08.417
Fear not. My man is made of sterner stuff.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.378
[Will groans]

11:10.461 --> 11:13.339
-Yes, again!
-Come on, Mondrich! Watch your feet!

11:19.261 --> 11:20.721
[playful music plays]

11:23.099 --> 11:25.393
[music, no dialogue]

11:29.689 --> 11:31.649
-[music ends]
-[crowd jeering loudly]

11:37.488 --> 11:39.824
You must tell me, Your Highness,
do you miss your homeland?

11:39.907 --> 11:43.327
I have never been to Prussia,
but I have read of its beauty.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.121
It has attractions, to be sure.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.581
That said,
I attended school here in England,

11:47.665 --> 11:50.626
and I have often thought
there is no better place to live,

11:50.710 --> 11:51.961
or to raise a family.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.340
Uh, forgive me if I am too forthright,

11:56.424 --> 11:58.801
but you have a great affinity
for your family, do you not?

11:58.884 --> 12:02.263
I do. They are
the dearest thing in the world to me.

12:02.763 --> 12:03.806
Are you close to yours?

12:03.889 --> 12:05.891
I grew up
with many cousins running underfoot

12:05.975 --> 12:09.103
and I believe I should like the same
for my children one day…

12:09.603 --> 12:12.565
if my wife were amenable, of course.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.163
[crowd cheers]

12:28.998 --> 12:30.040
Come on, Billy!

12:30.124 --> 12:31.083
Go on, Mondrich!

12:31.167 --> 12:33.711
Focus, Mondrich! Get your wits about you!

12:35.379 --> 12:38.007
Go on, Gillespie! Plant a facer!

12:40.760 --> 12:41.761
Good man! Another!

12:42.428 --> 12:43.804
[grunting]

12:43.888 --> 12:44.722
[crowd cheers]

12:45.556 --> 12:46.432
[Daphne exclaims]

12:56.484 --> 12:57.735
[bell rings]

12:57.818 --> 12:59.111
[crowd cheers loudly]

13:00.446 --> 13:01.781
[Anthony] Go on, Mondrich!

13:08.746 --> 13:09.997
[inaudible dialogue]

13:16.253 --> 13:18.255
-[man] You guaranteed my money.
-Gentlemen!

13:18.339 --> 13:21.967
I assure you, on my good name,
each of you will receive your payments.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.553
I merely need two days to raise the blunt.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.556
[men murmuring]

13:29.391 --> 13:31.310
[Henry] What do you think, Bridgerton?

13:31.393 --> 13:33.270
This one more to your liking?

13:33.354 --> 13:34.396
Mr. Granville--

13:34.480 --> 13:36.607
Perhaps they should take it
over to Somerset House

13:36.690 --> 13:39.235
so it can be skyed right next to mine.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.320
I believe I owe you an apology, sir.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.197
Unnecessary.

13:43.864 --> 13:46.242
I actually quite enjoy
the eloquent stings of your critique.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.284
[Benedict] Mm.

13:47.785 --> 13:48.619
So?

13:49.453 --> 13:51.455
A touch morose for my tastes.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.373
[Henry] Mm.

13:54.083 --> 13:54.917
[Henry inhales]

13:55.000 --> 13:57.253
A tragedy. The hound deserved better.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.380
[laughs] Where is yours?

14:00.130 --> 14:01.340
-My…
-Your work.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.261
Are you to tell me
you're not an artist yourself?

14:05.344 --> 14:07.721
Well, I-- I suppose sometimes I like to…

14:07.805 --> 14:09.390
Well, I mean, I almost--

14:09.473 --> 14:12.685
I believe "yes" and "thank you"
are the words you seek.

14:13.727 --> 14:16.897
But either way,
you should come by my studio.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.484
The pieces I do for myself are there,

14:20.568 --> 14:23.696
and I think you will find
my real work far less, um…

14:24.154 --> 14:27.575
Oh, how did you put it?
"Cold and lacking inner life"?

14:27.658 --> 14:30.411
Mm. I shall never live that down, shall I?

14:30.494 --> 14:32.121
-[chuckles]
-[Henry] Hmm.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.289
[Benedict laughs]

14:41.547 --> 14:43.757
I hear you are to leave town tonight.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.551
You hear correctly.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.346
I misjudged you.
I was never quite certain,

14:49.430 --> 14:52.600
but now it is clear your intentions
with Daphne were honorable after all.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.019
She has found herself a prince,

14:55.811 --> 14:57.313
and you are going on your way.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.358
Perhaps one day the two of us
will be able to laugh at all this?

15:01.859 --> 15:02.735
Perhaps.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.946
Are you to tell me
you're sorry to see me go?

15:06.030 --> 15:08.365
We should not have
to go that far, should we?

15:08.449 --> 15:09.742
[Simon chuckles]

15:14.204 --> 15:15.122
Lord Bridgerton.

15:15.831 --> 15:16.749
Your Highness.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.752
I was told you would be here.
Might we have a word?

15:19.835 --> 15:20.920
[Benedict] Certainly.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.008
[inaudible dialogue]

15:32.389 --> 15:33.974
Your brother took you where?

15:34.058 --> 15:36.602
He kept close watch
the entire time, Mama.

15:36.685 --> 15:40.773
It does not matter. A boxing exhibition
is no place for any young lady.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.984
Is it a place for a prince?
Was he at today's match, Sister?

15:44.068 --> 15:44.902
He certainly was.

15:44.985 --> 15:47.237
It is a loathsome
and barbarous form of entertainment.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.531
-What about the duke?
-[both] What about the duke?

15:51.325 --> 15:53.327
Was he also present?

15:54.078 --> 15:55.079
I do not know.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.748
If the duke was there, I did not see him.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.541
[playing classical piano tune]

16:03.087 --> 16:05.047
-What are you writing?
-Nothing. [clears throat]

16:05.130 --> 16:07.383
You sit about,
writing nothing all day long.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.009
[sighs] I am telling Francesca

16:09.093 --> 16:10.970
about what an officious
little busybody you are.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.388
[chuckles ironically]

16:16.350 --> 16:17.935
Mother. Daph.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.020
Did you truly take your sister
to a boxing match?

16:20.104 --> 16:22.064
Your admonishment will have to wait.
I have news.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.067
Prince Friedrich has asked
for my permission to propose.

16:26.610 --> 16:27.569
So soon?

16:28.112 --> 16:29.738
Well, what did you tell him?

16:29.822 --> 16:32.032
That I know better
than to answer for my sister.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.702
I have no objections to the man.
People speak well of him.

16:34.785 --> 16:38.288
Whatever you decide, Daph,
you shall have my support.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.165
[tense music plays]

16:44.253 --> 16:45.796
I… uh…

16:45.879 --> 16:47.297
I… [sighs]

16:47.798 --> 16:49.216
You need not decide now.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.927
You have not known him long.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.513
Let me know when you have an answer,
and I shall convey it.

16:55.097 --> 16:55.931
Indeed.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.908
It is quite a necklace. [chuckles]

17:17.828 --> 17:18.871
Do you like it?

17:19.705 --> 17:21.165
It is very beautiful.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.458
But do you like it?

17:24.752 --> 17:27.296
If you should have something to say,
Mama, please say it.

17:27.379 --> 17:28.839
Well, I only wonder…

17:32.176 --> 17:34.845
If you wear that necklace at
tonight's ball, what will the duke think?

17:34.928 --> 17:35.763
Oh, Mama!

17:35.846 --> 17:38.057
Until you have decided
to accept the prince's proposal,

17:38.140 --> 17:40.225
I simply think
you should keep your mind open.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.604
Mama, I do not care what the duke thinks.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.899
Besides,
he will not even be at tonight's ball.

17:46.982 --> 17:49.818
-What happened between the two of you?
-Nothing happened.

17:50.736 --> 17:51.570
He is leaving.

17:51.653 --> 17:54.448
I know my daughter.
I know it was not nothing between you.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.532
You do not know.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.451
You do not know anything.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.119
Daphne, I know what I saw!

17:59.203 --> 18:00.287
What you saw…

18:01.330 --> 18:02.247
was a lie.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.376
What?

18:07.586 --> 18:08.420
It was a lie.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.215
It was a ruse.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.512
The… duke and I, we were pretending,

18:17.179 --> 18:19.932
all so I could attract
a suitor of a high enough rank,

18:20.015 --> 18:22.059
all so I could be that much more…

18:22.684 --> 18:23.644
desirable.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.106
It was an agreement.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.566
It was an act, and it worked.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.943
We got what we wanted.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.986
You did, too. I now have a prince.

18:33.612 --> 18:34.613
You should be proud.

18:34.696 --> 18:38.075
What I wanted, dearest,
was for you to have the best,

18:38.158 --> 18:40.410
not in terms of rank, but love.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.746
And what I have seen
between you and the duke--

18:42.830 --> 18:44.832
It was not real, Mama!

18:46.750 --> 18:48.001
Everything you saw…

18:48.794 --> 18:50.129
None of it was real.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.424
Well, it…

18:54.508 --> 18:55.717
It is over now.

18:57.761 --> 19:00.139
[voice breaking]
I do not have to pretend any longer.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.566
I am sorry, Mama.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.861
I am so sorry. [sobs lightly]

19:18.949 --> 19:20.701
It is a beautiful necklace.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.079
I should like it very much.

19:34.214 --> 19:36.175
[Lady Danbury]
I would tell you it's been lovely

19:36.258 --> 19:38.051
spending all this time
with you, Your Grace,

19:38.135 --> 19:40.929
but I tend to leave
such sycophantic behavior

19:41.013 --> 19:42.431
for the rest of the ton.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.975
I shall miss you, too, Lady Danbury.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.270
Are you going to tell me
where you will go?

19:48.687 --> 19:49.813
This time, that is.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.481
I am still considering, but--

19:51.565 --> 19:53.233
It does not really matter, does it?

19:53.317 --> 19:56.069
I am sure you will abscond
to some remote corner of the world

19:56.153 --> 19:58.488
and continue to do
what you have always done.

19:58.572 --> 20:02.784
-And what would that be?
-Take everything you have for granted.

20:03.994 --> 20:07.289
The young man
I have always taken pride in raising,

20:07.372 --> 20:08.207
well…

20:09.625 --> 20:11.501
I would have expected more.

20:12.377 --> 20:15.839
More discernment,
more understanding, more appreciation.

20:15.923 --> 20:16.757
Lady Danbury--

20:16.840 --> 20:20.093
You allowed that young lady
to slip through your fingers

20:20.177 --> 20:21.303
as if it were nothing.

20:22.262 --> 20:25.849
I understand that you believe
such subjects as love and devotion,

20:25.933 --> 20:27.434
affection and attachment,

20:27.517 --> 20:29.853
you find it all trite and frivolous.

20:29.937 --> 20:34.107
But have you any idea those very things
are precisely what have allowed

20:34.191 --> 20:37.945
a new day to begin to dawn
in this society?

20:39.488 --> 20:40.697
Look at our queen.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.909
Look at our king. Look at their marriage.

20:43.992 --> 20:47.537
Look at everything it is doing for us,

20:47.621 --> 20:49.831
allowing us to become.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.919
We were two separate societies,
divided by color,

20:54.002 --> 20:57.172
until a king fell in love with one of us.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.592
Love, Your Grace…

21:01.551 --> 21:03.178
conquers all.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.307
I believe that remains to be seen.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.228
The king may have chosen his queen.

21:11.853 --> 21:13.021
He may have elevated us

21:13.105 --> 21:15.816
from novelties in their eyes
to now dukes and royalty,

21:15.899 --> 21:17.484
and at that same whim…

21:18.443 --> 21:20.821
he may just as easily change his mind,

21:21.738 --> 21:25.033
a mind, as we all know, that is hanging on
by one very loose and tenuous thread.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.078
So, no, I am sorry, Lady Danbury,
we are in disagreement here.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.872
Love changes nothing.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.713
My ship departs at quarter past nine.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.382
I will write to you…

21:41.758 --> 21:42.926
from wherever I go.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.769
[Lady Whistledown] As we all know,

21:52.853 --> 21:56.773
there is nothing this author loves
more than a scandal,

21:56.857 --> 22:00.652
and tonight's soiree promises
more than its fair share,

22:00.736 --> 22:04.323
courtesy of the recently widowed
Lady Trowbridge.

22:04.406 --> 22:07.409
Some may call
her celebrations too provocative,

22:07.492 --> 22:09.202
and I would caution any young lady

22:09.286 --> 22:13.206
from getting caught up
in the sensual nature of her fêtes.

22:13.290 --> 22:16.626
For one scandalous move
between an unwed couple,

22:16.710 --> 22:20.047
a wayward touch, or heaven forbid, a kiss,

22:20.130 --> 22:24.676
would banish any young lady
from society in a trail of ruin.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.347
Lord Rutledge.

22:30.515 --> 22:34.019
Miss Thompson
has spent all afternoon telling us

22:34.102 --> 22:36.813
how eager she is to converse with you.

22:36.897 --> 22:41.234
I don't need her conversation.
I shall like to see how she spins.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.238
[sneezes]

22:46.531 --> 22:48.950
-Mr. Finch.
-Pardon me, Miss Featherington.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.370
-[chuckles]
-Oh! What a delectable frock!

22:55.207 --> 22:57.292
I so love cheese.

22:58.126 --> 23:00.462
-As do I, Mr. Finch. [chuckles]
-[laughs]

23:00.545 --> 23:03.799
Though, I must say,
I do prefer a Stilton to a cheddar.

23:05.675 --> 23:07.052
-[Albion chuckles]
-Mm!

23:09.679 --> 23:12.557
Perhaps we will have two weddings
this season, my lord.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.850
Oh, I do doubt that.

23:27.906 --> 23:28.990
Daphne! [chuckles]

23:29.533 --> 23:32.494
-You look beautiful, as always.
-Thank you, Cressida.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.373
You could have chosen anyone.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.792
You have gentlemen lined up
to pay you tribute.

23:39.292 --> 23:42.879
Yet you did not hesitate to steal
my chance for happiness away, did you?

23:43.922 --> 23:46.550
I knew the marriage market
would make rivals of us,

23:47.050 --> 23:48.969
but I never thought you capable
of being my enemy.

23:49.052 --> 23:51.138
The man made his choice, Cressida.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.766
What did you expect me to do?

24:03.733 --> 24:07.404
Miss Bridgerton.
You look absolutely exquisite, as always.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.281
Thank you, Your Highness.

24:09.364 --> 24:11.825
I hope there's room on your dance card
for the two of us.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.201
I believe there is.

24:41.396 --> 24:43.940
Why is this painting here
and not at Somerset House?

24:44.024 --> 24:45.275
Have you forgotten, sir?

24:45.358 --> 24:47.736
You requested it returned to you,

24:47.819 --> 24:50.822

to arrange, I might add.

25:21.937 --> 25:22.938
Thank you.

25:31.863 --> 25:35.534
I do not know what I was expecting,
but it surely was not this.

25:35.617 --> 25:38.828
Oh, simply a gathering
of like-minded souls.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.081
Here, let me show you
what I've been working on.

25:42.165 --> 25:45.252
They speak of war abroad as if
it will distract from inequities at home.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.504
They do not need a war to be distracted.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.089
Why, this Whistledown's enough

25:49.172 --> 25:51.967
to turn their eyes
from the needs of ordinary people.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.134
[Henry] What do you think?

25:53.927 --> 25:54.970
[Benedict sighs]

25:56.555 --> 25:57.597
Hmm.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.891
It's a far cry
from Somerset House, I must say.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.309
I shall take that as a compliment.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.227
[both chuckle]

26:02.310 --> 26:04.479
And I must say, I'm truly jealous.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.398
Is this your life?

26:07.983 --> 26:10.402
There are advantages
to being the second-born.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.779
Heirs have the responsibility.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.448
-Second sons have the fun.
-[both chuckle]

26:15.532 --> 26:16.408
So…

26:17.325 --> 26:18.827
why not go have some fun?

26:42.892 --> 26:44.436
[exhales slowly]

26:55.572 --> 26:58.033
[singing "Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour"
in French]

27:04.205 --> 27:07.792
[guests chattering quietly]

27:38.948 --> 27:40.200
[Violet] Anthony?

27:40.283 --> 27:41.242
Anthony.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.537
This is Miss Addington,
the Earl of Lindsay's niece.

27:44.621 --> 27:45.872
-Pleasure.
-Mm.

27:45.955 --> 27:48.208
[Violet chuckles] There, you see?

27:56.758 --> 27:57.884
[chuckles awkwardly]

28:01.429 --> 28:03.640
Quite the affair, Lady Trowbridge.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.183
You have such, uh…

28:05.684 --> 28:08.061
[chuckles] …striking taste.

28:08.144 --> 28:10.063
What a compliment, Lady Featherington,

28:10.146 --> 28:11.981
especially from you.

28:12.691 --> 28:13.817
[Lady Featherington] Mm.

28:13.900 --> 28:17.612
Philippa, should you not be
on the dance floor with Mr. Finch?

28:17.696 --> 28:18.613
[Philippa sobs]

28:19.280 --> 28:20.156
Dry your eyes.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.951
Such constant commotion
with this one, Mama.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.870
-Mr. Finch won't so much as meet my eye.
-[Prudence scoffs]

28:25.954 --> 28:27.914
Papa told him something, and now…

28:29.040 --> 28:30.375
I loved him. [sobs]

28:36.589 --> 28:38.425
Whatever did you say to Mr. Finch?

28:38.508 --> 28:40.969
He may not be a lord,
but he's perfectly suitable,

28:41.052 --> 28:42.554
and Phillipa has no other suitors.

28:42.637 --> 28:44.681
Then we shall wait until next season.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.475
With two others unwed?

28:47.559 --> 28:50.311
They can all wait until next season,
as far as I'm concerned.

28:50.395 --> 28:53.148
Could you truly wish
to embarrass me further tonight?

28:53.648 --> 28:55.191
I would advise against it.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.380
What are you doing in my room?

29:18.131 --> 29:19.048
Oh… Uh…

29:19.549 --> 29:22.761
Mama asked me to retrieve
the latest copy of Lady Whistledown.

29:22.844 --> 29:27.682
She wanted to count how many times Daphne
and Prince Friedrich had been mentioned.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.559
The viscountess is at the Trowbridge ball.

29:29.642 --> 29:32.353
She did not seem particularly pleased
about Prince Friedrich.

29:33.021 --> 29:34.355
[chuckles nervously]

29:34.439 --> 29:36.524
Why do you have them,
all of these Whistledowns?

29:36.608 --> 29:38.902
Must I explain myself to you?

29:39.444 --> 29:40.487
Yes…

29:41.279 --> 29:42.113
you must.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.532
After all, I am a Bridgerton,
so therefore your mistress.

29:45.742 --> 29:48.787
I wiped your bottom
when you were in leading strings,

29:48.870 --> 29:51.080
and I… I do not appreciate your tone.

29:51.164 --> 29:55.627
I asked you once, and I ask again,
what are you doing in my room, Eloise?

29:55.710 --> 29:57.629
Thinking perhaps you are Lady Whistledown.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.924
[laughing]

30:01.633 --> 30:04.344
Or… if not you,

30:04.427 --> 30:06.930
then perhaps another servant type.

30:07.013 --> 30:08.932
Are you not meant to be the smart one?

30:09.015 --> 30:10.642
-I beg your pardon?
-[laughs]

30:10.725 --> 30:15.271
You believe a servant would ever have
the time to be Lady Whistledown,

30:15.355 --> 30:17.106
with all the work we must do?

30:17.190 --> 30:19.567
-[laughing continues]
-[Eloise chuckles awkwardly]

30:20.902 --> 30:26.115
You believe I would be working for you
if I had all the money Whistledown does?

30:26.199 --> 30:28.576
-[Eloise sighs ironically]
-Oh! Oh!

30:28.660 --> 30:31.287
Oh, it hurts. [laughing continues]

30:33.456 --> 30:34.457
Get out.

30:39.587 --> 30:41.130
[guests chattering]

30:52.684 --> 30:54.185
Our host looks a bit fussy.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.397
Do you think if he goes to bed,
we all have to leave?

30:57.480 --> 30:58.314
[Penelope chuckles]

30:58.398 --> 31:01.776
It's lucky the lady produced an heir
before the old earl croaked, no?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.069
Lucky, indeed.

31:03.903 --> 31:06.155
But do you not think
the boy bears a passing resemblance

31:06.239 --> 31:07.782
to Lady Trowbridge's footman?

31:07.866 --> 31:08.908
Penelope!

31:09.951 --> 31:10.994
What a barb!

31:18.167 --> 31:20.336
I've tried to get in front
of Miss Thompson all night.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.922
Surely she cannot be interested
in Lord Rutledge, can she?

31:23.006 --> 31:25.133
I think the only thing
Miss Thompson is interested in

31:25.216 --> 31:26.759
is a swift rescue, indeed.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.137
I believe you are right.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.055
Oh, Colin, I did not mean--

31:38.479 --> 31:39.314
Another?

31:39.397 --> 31:41.357
[chuckles] I do believe a third dance

31:41.441 --> 31:43.484
would be considered improper, my lord.

31:43.568 --> 31:47.196
You need not continue
to prove your virtue to me, my girl.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.408
There are other things
a man looks for in a wife.

31:50.491 --> 31:52.327
Miss Thompson. A dance?

31:56.873 --> 31:58.833
Are you well recovered, Miss Thompson?

31:59.584 --> 32:01.669
Oh, yes. Um, I was quite ill.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.172
And what a suspicious illness
you came down with.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.716
It seems to have manifested

32:06.799 --> 32:09.302
as a walking spittle factory
with very large teeth.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.891
-Am I the only one who can see it?
-Alas, I can as well.

32:14.974 --> 32:17.685
But spin me away,
and perhaps I shall recover.

32:18.853 --> 32:20.313
[both laughing]

32:24.943 --> 32:26.569
They appear to be enjoying themselves.

32:26.653 --> 32:30.698
Yes. My brother Colin certainly knows
how to make things memorable.

32:32.241 --> 32:33.993
Well, perhaps I may do the same.

32:36.537 --> 32:39.540
I know we've only known each other
a short time, Miss Bridgerton,

32:39.624 --> 32:41.793
but from the moment
I laid eyes on you, I, uh--

32:48.174 --> 32:50.843
-Ah! There you are.
-Here I am, Your Highness.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.471
As I was saying,

32:54.138 --> 32:56.599
some in Prussia believe I have run away,

32:56.683 --> 32:59.936
but the truth is I left
to find someone to start a life with.

33:00.019 --> 33:02.397
-To have a family with.
-[gasps]

33:07.318 --> 33:08.194
[gasps]

33:10.196 --> 33:14.450
And so I find myself left
with one question to ask.

33:18.496 --> 33:19.914
-Miss Bridgerton--
-I need a moment.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.544
To refresh myself, Your Highness.
[breathes nervously]

33:24.627 --> 33:26.921
Miss Bridgerton, are you yet engaged?

33:27.922 --> 33:31.175
You must set me up with one
of those brothers I hear the prince has.

33:31.968 --> 33:34.137
Do watch where you are flying, angel.

33:34.929 --> 33:35.930
[exhales nervously]

33:37.932 --> 33:39.559
[gasping]

33:45.690 --> 33:47.233
[grunts loudly, panting]

33:50.069 --> 33:51.279
[Simon] Miss Bridgerton.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.198
[gasps]

33:56.242 --> 33:57.785
What are you doing here?

34:00.955 --> 34:04.292
-I thought you were leaving London.
-I was. I am.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.962
-I came to say goodbye.
-To whom?

34:08.046 --> 34:10.715
-To you.
-Your goodbye is wholly unnecessary.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.092
We are not friends.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.845
We never were friends,
as you made abundantly clear.

34:15.928 --> 34:18.514
-And I am sorry for that.
-Please, do not apologize.

34:20.266 --> 34:23.895
I shall not be led once more
by you from this direction to that.

34:24.395 --> 34:28.149
You are my friend. You are not my friend.
You are a rake. You are not a rake.

34:28.232 --> 34:30.026
-You are sorry--
-I am sorry.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.235
That is very well.

34:32.820 --> 34:36.157
But you should know that your apology
has absolutely no effect on my life,

34:36.240 --> 34:38.076
nor does your leaving London.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.286
I am marrying the prince.

34:40.953 --> 34:43.206
I shall be very happy, indeed.

34:46.709 --> 34:48.795
Will you be? Happy?

34:48.878 --> 34:50.046
Why would I not be?

34:51.798 --> 34:53.174
Prince Friedrich is kind…

34:54.467 --> 34:55.384
and adoring…

34:56.427 --> 34:58.054
and he knows what he wants.

34:59.472 --> 35:02.225
He is a good man,
and he will make a wonderful father.

35:02.308 --> 35:04.811
And so you truly believe him
the best man for you?

35:04.894 --> 35:06.979
How dare you question my choices?

35:08.272 --> 35:10.900
They are my choices to make, not yours.

35:10.983 --> 35:14.487
I do not question your choice
to rake across the continent,

35:14.570 --> 35:15.780
forlorn and alone.

35:16.948 --> 35:20.493
I do not have to explain myself to you.
I do not owe you anything.

35:21.160 --> 35:24.330
He is perfect for me.
I am going to be princess!

35:31.295 --> 35:32.880
Are you going to say anything?

35:38.594 --> 35:39.679
Well, then, leave.

35:41.931 --> 35:42.765
[groans]

35:43.641 --> 35:44.684
Very well.

35:47.311 --> 35:48.437
[Simon] Miss Bridgerton.

35:49.188 --> 35:50.231
Miss Bridgerton.

35:51.566 --> 35:52.692
Miss Bridgerton!

35:59.157 --> 36:00.408
Come back to the party.

36:01.075 --> 36:02.201
Stop walking!

36:02.285 --> 36:04.954
-Stop following me.
-It is not safe out here.

36:05.705 --> 36:09.167
-I forbid you to go any further.
-You cannot tell me what to do.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.168
[Simon] Daphne…

36:11.460 --> 36:13.004
Will you not listen?

36:21.929 --> 36:23.389
[Daphne breaths tremulously]

36:25.266 --> 36:26.809
My most sincere apologies.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.352
[Daphne panting]

36:28.436 --> 36:29.353
[Simon] I…

36:31.397 --> 36:32.523
I…

36:42.033 --> 36:44.118
[Daphne gasping] Oh!

36:49.332 --> 36:50.750
[both grunting, moaning]

36:53.836 --> 36:54.879
[Daphne gasps]

36:58.341 --> 36:59.592
Bastard!

36:59.675 --> 37:01.761
-[Anthony grunts]
-Anthony!

37:03.179 --> 37:04.347
[Daphne gasps]

37:07.892 --> 37:08.935
You will marry her.

37:10.102 --> 37:11.771
-What?
-[Anthony] Immediately.

37:11.854 --> 37:13.689
We can only hope
no one saw you take such liberties,

37:13.773 --> 37:15.524
and my sister
is saved further mortification.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.401
-You will marry her!
-Brother!

37:17.485 --> 37:19.654
[panting] I cannot marry her.

37:22.365 --> 37:25.326
You have defiled her innocence,
and now you refuse her hand?

37:27.370 --> 37:29.580
I knew you were a rake, Hastings,
never thought a villain.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.666
I cannot marry her.

37:35.586 --> 37:37.088
Then you leave me no choice.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.840
I must demand satisfaction.

37:40.633 --> 37:43.135
A duel? Anthony, you cannot--

37:43.219 --> 37:44.679
He dishonors you, sister.

37:44.762 --> 37:48.099
He dishonors you and me
and the very Bridgerton name.

37:49.141 --> 37:51.644
I have misjudged you, indeed.
You have duped us both,

37:51.727 --> 37:54.105
but I shall not see
my sister pay for my own misdeeds.

37:54.188 --> 37:56.649
-We will settle this as gentlemen.
-I understand.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.110
I shall see you at dawn.

38:01.153 --> 38:02.738
I do not understand.

38:04.115 --> 38:07.034
You would rather die than marry me?

38:09.287 --> 38:10.621
I am truly sorry.

38:12.873 --> 38:14.625
[Anthony] We need to go, Daph,

38:14.709 --> 38:16.168
before anyone should see us.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.345
[distorted sigh]

38:30.474 --> 38:32.226
[distorted heartbeat]

38:32.310 --> 38:34.312
[distorted laughing, chattering]

38:39.775 --> 38:40.860
[distortion ends]

38:40.943 --> 38:44.071
[Violet] Champagne!
It sounds like "sham" and "pain."

38:44.155 --> 38:46.073
It is quite amusing, really. [laughs]

38:46.657 --> 38:49.035
Our sister has a headache.
I am taking her home.

38:49.577 --> 38:52.747
-See to Mother, will you?
-Daphne, you look unwell.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.665
Did you catch a chill in the garden?

39:05.051 --> 39:06.802
[bristles brushing]

39:16.479 --> 39:17.355
Hmm.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.774
-You have great potential.
-It's nothing.

39:20.274 --> 39:22.068
Though,
for such a staunch critic of others,

39:22.151 --> 39:24.070
you certainly lack
a clear eye for your own work.

39:24.153 --> 39:26.155
It's the lines.
Not what they're supposed to be.

39:26.238 --> 39:28.157
Take the compliment, Bridgerton.

39:28.866 --> 39:31.202
There is no expectation or judgment here.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.038
You left all of that back in Mayfair.

39:34.789 --> 39:35.790
[Benedict chuckles]

39:36.290 --> 39:38.542
You can feel free to be yourself here…

39:39.293 --> 39:40.961
if that's what you should like.

39:41.462 --> 39:43.631
It's what works for me, at least.

39:43.714 --> 39:47.426
And I haven't been dissatisfied
with my lines in… well, quite some time.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.511
[Benedict chuckles]

39:48.594 --> 39:51.972
-Well, I've done worse, I suppose, really.
-Mm. Fair enough.

39:52.681 --> 39:55.851
I seem to have enjoyed myself
too much this evening.

39:56.352 --> 39:57.812
I should be on my way.

39:57.895 --> 39:59.814
[exhales deeply] As you wish.

39:59.897 --> 40:04.402
But know you are welcome back any time
for practice or even conversation.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.612
[both laughing]

40:07.696 --> 40:08.572
I'll see you out.

40:17.123 --> 40:20.334
I knew something was amiss
when he insisted we keep Miss Thompson,

40:20.418 --> 40:22.002
but did I quarrel with him? No.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.587
I did what I was told, I did my best.

40:23.671 --> 40:26.090
But getting rid
of my dear Philippa's one and only suitor…

40:26.173 --> 40:29.009
Under no circumstances. Intolerable man!

40:30.302 --> 40:31.470
Guard the door.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.514
What exactly
are you hoping to find, ma'am?

40:33.597 --> 40:36.016
I shan't know that,
Mrs. Varley, until I find it.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.689
Pen, he is kind and funny

40:41.772 --> 40:43.983
and a surprisingly accomplished dancer.

40:44.066 --> 40:47.486
And, well, I'm sure you've seen him
with the small Bridgertons.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.947
He will be a wonderful father.

40:50.030 --> 40:51.198
[chuckles lightly]

40:51.824 --> 40:54.702
Surely, though,
Colin is a tad young for marriage.

40:54.785 --> 40:56.912
You do need someone
who will propose soon.

40:56.996 --> 40:59.623
But that is why
Mr. Bridgerton is so perfect.

40:59.707 --> 41:02.209
Did you see the way he rescued me tonight?

41:02.293 --> 41:06.714
He's not like the other young men
who play games and guard their affections.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.549
He is eager.

41:09.842 --> 41:12.428
Pen, I believe he will propose soon.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.139
-I shan't have to marry Rutledge.
-[forced chuckle]

41:17.266 --> 41:20.144
Oh, I am sorry.
Am I keeping you awake with all this talk?

41:20.227 --> 41:22.354
Yes, I do feel sleep coming over me.

41:23.272 --> 41:24.440
But, Pen…

41:25.399 --> 41:26.609
the best part is,

41:27.526 --> 41:29.695
when we wed,
I'll be able to stay in town.

41:29.778 --> 41:33.991
And since you and Eloise are so close,
we will all practically be sisters.

41:34.074 --> 41:35.117
Imagine that.

41:35.201 --> 41:36.202
[exhales joyously]

41:38.287 --> 41:39.288
[door opens]

41:40.247 --> 41:41.207
[door closes]

41:43.542 --> 41:45.252
[sobbing breaths]

41:54.303 --> 41:55.471
[light tapping]

41:56.889 --> 41:57.890
[light tapping]

42:04.396 --> 42:05.356
I have a theory.

42:05.898 --> 42:06.815
[strained chuckle]

42:06.899 --> 42:09.652
-Eloise, it is quite late.
-A good theory about Lady Whistledown.

42:09.735 --> 42:13.239
I thought she had to be a servant,
but I was wrong, quite wrong.

42:13.322 --> 42:16.033
Because who truly has
the time and means to be that remarkable?

42:16.116 --> 42:17.910
Who would be invited
to all of the parties,

42:17.993 --> 42:20.120
able to hear things unnoticed by others?

42:20.204 --> 42:21.580
Perhaps we can discuss it tomorrow.

42:21.664 --> 42:24.291
Lady Whistledown is someone free
and unencumbered by society.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.877
She is a single woman of means.
Better yet, she is a widow,

42:26.961 --> 42:29.922
who would be invited to all of the events
but not paid any attention.

42:30.005 --> 42:31.173
While you were at the ball--

42:31.257 --> 42:32.633
Eloise, I do not care!

42:34.843 --> 42:37.471
People have real problems,
mature problems,

42:37.555 --> 42:38.889
problems that have nothing to do

42:38.973 --> 42:40.766
with the secret identity
of some silly writer.

42:42.184 --> 42:43.769
And you are so mature now?

42:44.562 --> 42:45.729
Well, I am of age.

42:45.813 --> 42:47.231
I am out in society.

42:47.314 --> 42:50.109
Therefore, I have more important,
mature things to worry about.

42:50.192 --> 42:51.652
-Like what?
-Like marriage.

42:51.735 --> 42:53.862
-You do not care about marriage.
-What if I do?

42:55.406 --> 42:57.449
I cannot expect you to understand.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.618
Not everyone can be a pretty Bridgerton.

43:04.039 --> 43:05.249
Eloise, I did not--

43:05.791 --> 43:06.875
Eloise, wait!

43:14.383 --> 43:16.719
Thank you, Humboldt.
No need to send anyone up.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.930
I want you to know
I am not angry with you.

43:20.014 --> 43:22.266
I do not blame you for what transpired.

43:22.349 --> 43:24.476
Do not treat me like a child.

43:24.560 --> 43:25.728
I did this.

43:25.811 --> 43:29.023
-He took advantage of you.
-No less than I took liberties with him.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.441
You do not understand.

43:31.025 --> 43:34.194
I should have protected you better.
I knew his true nature from the start.

43:34.695 --> 43:36.780
You think that just because I am a woman,

43:36.864 --> 43:39.450
I am incapable of making my own choices?

43:40.117 --> 43:41.118
Is that it, brother?

43:42.328 --> 43:45.289
Do you even care
that Simon has dishonored me, as you say,

43:45.372 --> 43:48.876
or is it your own male pride
that you seek to satisfy?

43:48.959 --> 43:51.754
-You are to go on up to bed.
-You cannot duel him.

43:51.837 --> 43:54.173
It is illegal, to name but one reason.

43:54.256 --> 43:56.842
You could both be arrested,
let alone killed.

43:58.969 --> 44:01.347
-There must be another way.
-What would you have me do?

44:02.222 --> 44:03.641
I do not take this decision lightly,

44:03.724 --> 44:06.185
but this is the way
things are handled amongst gentlemen.

44:06.268 --> 44:08.729
-If this were to become known--
-I could live with that.

44:09.229 --> 44:12.775
What I could not live with
is the duke's death on my hands.

44:13.567 --> 44:16.362
Nor yours, however tempting
that may be at this very moment.

44:16.445 --> 44:19.114
It is more than just your honor at stake.
It is your sisters', too,

44:19.198 --> 44:20.616
the entire family name.

44:20.699 --> 44:21.742
It has been decided.

44:21.825 --> 44:22.868
Oh, this is madness!

44:24.745 --> 44:25.579
What is it?

44:26.455 --> 44:27.498
You and I need to talk.

44:28.290 --> 44:29.458
Daphne, bed.

44:32.294 --> 44:33.295
[door slams]

44:34.797 --> 44:37.091
[panting deeply, growls]

44:37.966 --> 44:39.677
I will need you to stand as my second.

44:41.428 --> 44:43.180
What if you get yourself killed?

44:43.263 --> 44:45.724
Then the title and estates
will pass to you.

44:48.102 --> 44:50.938
-And if you kill Hastings?
-I shall have to leave the country.

44:51.021 --> 44:53.273
You'll be head of the family
in every way that matters.

44:54.900 --> 44:55.984
[muffled chuckling]

44:56.985 --> 44:59.488
[Colin] Of course not.
You are clearly sober.

44:59.571 --> 45:01.073
[Violet laughs]

45:03.075 --> 45:06.245
And I'm sober enough to know
when you're being impertinent.

45:07.204 --> 45:09.456
-Good night, dear.
-Good night, Mother.

45:13.293 --> 45:14.336
Come here.

45:14.420 --> 45:16.463
Good God. Did someone die?

45:17.047 --> 45:19.049
[clattering]

45:20.634 --> 45:21.802
What are you doing?

45:21.885 --> 45:24.471
I find myself
in rather desperate need of a drink.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.890
And this was the only place
you could find one?

45:31.979 --> 45:33.856
Are you not supposed
to be on a ship by now?

45:33.939 --> 45:34.898
Change of plans.

45:37.568 --> 45:40.696
For brandy this good, you need
to actually tell me what is going on.

45:42.865 --> 45:45.325
I am to meet Anthony Bridgerton at dawn.

45:53.625 --> 45:57.671
Whatever the insult, apologize,
and he will surely be a forgiving man.

45:57.755 --> 46:00.215
Not when it comes to his sister.

46:02.384 --> 46:05.053
Exactly how insulted was she?

46:06.889 --> 46:08.056
[exhales tremulously]

46:15.355 --> 46:17.149
I shall need another
if I am to be your second.

46:17.232 --> 46:19.026
-I cannot let you.
-You cannot stop me.

46:19.818 --> 46:21.820
[tense music plays]

46:49.389 --> 46:51.934
I believe you may have strayed too far
from home tonight.

46:52.017 --> 46:53.185
Siena, please.

46:54.394 --> 46:56.104
We cannot be together. I know that now.

46:56.188 --> 46:57.606
This world shall not permit it.

46:57.689 --> 47:00.234
But what if we were to find ourselves
in another situation,

47:00.317 --> 47:02.402
at a place
where you and I might be accepted,

47:02.486 --> 47:05.239
with none of the shame nor recriminations
that this society grants us.

47:05.322 --> 47:06.365
Would you have me then?

47:06.448 --> 47:08.617
You talk in dreams, my lord,

47:08.700 --> 47:10.661
and yet you deprive me
the luxury of sleep.

47:10.744 --> 47:11.995
I duel at dawn.

47:16.959 --> 47:18.126
An affair of honor?

47:18.210 --> 47:20.462
If I live to see sunrise, I am free…

47:21.672 --> 47:25.092
free of society, free of these rules,
the very ones that keep us apart.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.803
We could go together,
away from all this, Siena.

47:35.519 --> 47:36.603
My apologies.

47:38.355 --> 47:40.023
I've taxed your patience
for the last time.

47:44.319 --> 47:45.404
[Anthony moans]

47:47.489 --> 47:49.116
[both breathing heavily]

47:58.166 --> 47:59.918
[both grunting, moaning]

48:04.464 --> 48:05.757
[sighs]

48:17.352 --> 48:19.438
-Wh-- What are you doing in here?
-Hush.

48:20.022 --> 48:24.526
I found your ledgers,
hidden under old newspapers, no less.

48:26.528 --> 48:27.613
[exhales tremulously]

48:28.739 --> 48:30.282
I know of every transaction…

48:32.200 --> 48:33.911
every financial account.

48:33.994 --> 48:35.829
-Y-- You do not know--
-I know…

48:36.747 --> 48:37.664
everything.

48:38.832 --> 48:40.208
I know about your gambling.

48:40.792 --> 48:42.377
I know about your debts.

48:42.461 --> 48:45.088
I know that you have spent all our money.

48:45.172 --> 48:47.841
-I shall not--
-Including our girls' dowries!

48:53.013 --> 48:57.517
Is that not why you rejected
that perfectly acceptable Mr. Finch

48:57.601 --> 48:59.227
for our dear Philippa?

48:59.311 --> 49:02.856
Is it not why we continue
to keep Miss Thompson in our home?

49:02.940 --> 49:04.358
You owe her father too.

49:04.441 --> 49:07.069
So the question
certainly is not what I know!

49:08.278 --> 49:09.196
[sighs]

49:11.073 --> 49:12.324
The question is…

49:13.951 --> 49:16.286
what are you going to do about it?

49:18.914 --> 49:20.415
-[sobs]
-My lord?

49:21.750 --> 49:22.876
-My lord?
-[weeping]

49:28.590 --> 49:29.800
[sniffs loudly]

49:29.883 --> 49:30.926
Archibald…

49:31.009 --> 49:32.260
I've have failed you!

49:33.595 --> 49:35.097
I've-- I've--

49:35.180 --> 49:37.349
I have failed our daughters!

49:39.059 --> 49:39.893
I…

49:41.770 --> 49:43.939
I do not know what to do.

49:44.523 --> 49:46.024
[sobbing] Portia…

49:47.985 --> 49:49.486
I don't know what to do.

49:55.242 --> 49:57.244
[weeping, sniffing]

50:15.387 --> 50:17.389
[tense music plays]

50:18.098 --> 50:18.932
[kisses]

50:56.720 --> 50:58.722
[tense music continues]

51:07.981 --> 51:09.399
-Where have they gone?
-Daph…

51:09.483 --> 51:11.735
-Tell me where this duel takes place.
-Why would I do that?

51:11.818 --> 51:15.280
-So that I may prevent it from happening.
-Hastings has done you a grave dishonor.

51:15.363 --> 51:17.491
-Surely you wish to see him pay.
-Not with his life.

51:17.574 --> 51:19.993
It will not come to that.
The duke will remember his honor

51:20.077 --> 51:22.245
once he finds himself
on the deadly end of a pistol.

51:22.329 --> 51:23.538
And if he does not?

51:23.622 --> 51:26.625
They will both do the gentlemanly thing
and fire their pistols wide.

51:26.708 --> 51:30.337
Allow them to bring this ugly business
to a conclusion themselves.

51:30.420 --> 51:33.799
[groans] Do you know how many times
I have heard that said?

51:33.882 --> 51:35.592
To leave the men to their business

51:35.675 --> 51:38.762
and to not concern myself
with such weighty affairs,

51:39.346 --> 51:42.849
whose affairs are my future, my family.

51:43.517 --> 51:47.521
Anthony is too angry to fire wide,
and Simon is too stubborn to yield.

51:47.604 --> 51:49.022
You did not see them in that garden.

51:49.106 --> 51:51.191
No, I did not,
and neither did anyone else.

51:51.274 --> 51:53.360
You should be happy
that no one saw anything.

51:53.443 --> 51:57.322
Daphne, you look unwell.
Did you catch a chill in the garden?

51:58.365 --> 51:59.741
Only, someone did see.

52:01.618 --> 52:02.828
Cressida Cowper.

52:04.454 --> 52:06.540
Colin, you must tell me.

52:07.499 --> 52:08.708
Where have they gone?

52:21.680 --> 52:23.974
Doctor, I appreciate
your attendance and discretion.

52:24.057 --> 52:25.183
You have my blunt?

52:28.061 --> 52:31.022
Very well.
Try not to go dying while I am present.

52:31.106 --> 52:34.067
If the goal is merely to wound,
where should my brother aim?

52:34.151 --> 52:37.279
You think you have the skill
to guide the path of a moving bullet?

52:37.362 --> 52:40.407
Then you are either a fool
or the king's finest marksman.

52:41.032 --> 52:41.908
Which is it?

52:45.287 --> 52:46.746
[horses neighing]

52:54.421 --> 52:56.339
I have one last matter
to discuss with you.

52:56.423 --> 52:58.341
You have already provided
ample instruction.

52:58.425 --> 53:00.594
Contact the solicitor
and safeguard our sisters' dowries.

53:00.677 --> 53:01.511
An additional task.

53:01.595 --> 53:04.264
In the top drawer of my desk,
you shall find the name of a lady.

53:05.223 --> 53:08.018
If I die, you must ensure
she is provided for. Do you swear?

53:09.102 --> 53:10.478
-Benedict, do--
-I swear.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.448
-Brother--
-That is all.

53:29.831 --> 53:32.751
-Is there anything you need from me?
-My affairs are in order.

53:37.797 --> 53:39.799
[tense music intensifies]

54:07.994 --> 54:10.580
For what it is worth, I am sorry.

54:10.664 --> 54:12.791
Your apology is worth nothing to me.

54:21.508 --> 54:23.718
[pistols cocking]

54:34.271 --> 54:35.272
Ready!

54:35.355 --> 54:36.189
Ready!

55:06.886 --> 55:08.888
[tense music crescendos]

55:09.014 --> 55:10.223
-Stop!
-[gunshot]

55:10.307 --> 55:12.600
-[horse whinnies]
-Daphne! [gasps]

55:12.684 --> 55:14.019
Sister!

55:14.102 --> 55:15.937
Sister! Stand aside!

55:20.191 --> 55:22.068
-Oh, good God.
-[Daphne panting]

55:22.152 --> 55:24.154
Are you hurt? Tell me!

55:24.237 --> 55:28.116
I am perfectly well,
no thanks to you idiots.

55:28.199 --> 55:30.368
-What are you playing at?
-Says the man who just shot at me!

55:30.452 --> 55:31.953
You rode into the middle of a duel!

55:33.413 --> 55:34.831
I require a moment with the duke.

55:34.914 --> 55:37.584
-Daphne--
-I require a moment with the duke.

55:37.667 --> 55:38.752
Make it brief.

55:40.879 --> 55:42.714
You should not have come.
My mind's not changed.

55:42.797 --> 55:43.715
It must.

55:44.299 --> 55:46.051
If not for your sake, then mine.

55:46.843 --> 55:48.178
Simon, we were seen.

55:48.803 --> 55:50.930
Cressida Cowper
witnessed us in the garden.

55:51.014 --> 55:52.182
She knows.

55:52.265 --> 55:55.393
It is not merely your own life
that hangs in the balance now.

55:55.477 --> 55:58.355
If you do not marry me,
I shall be ruined.

56:00.607 --> 56:01.900
Daphne, I cannot.

56:03.026 --> 56:04.444
Did you not hear me?

56:05.028 --> 56:06.988
Someone knows what we have done,

56:07.072 --> 56:08.865
someone who will surely talk.

56:11.368 --> 56:16.581
What possible reason could you have
to condemn me to shame and reproach?

56:17.999 --> 56:18.958
Do you truly…

56:20.251 --> 56:22.462
Do you truly hold me in such low regard?

56:22.545 --> 56:25.006
It is because I regard you so highly
that I cannot marry you.

56:28.718 --> 56:30.011
I know you do not love me,

56:31.304 --> 56:33.306
but I never thought
you could despise me so.

56:33.390 --> 56:34.265
Daphne…

56:39.104 --> 56:40.814
You must know, if we were to wed…

56:43.566 --> 56:45.193
I can never give you children.

56:47.445 --> 56:50.073
It is your dream to be a mother,
is it not?

56:50.907 --> 56:52.992
To have a household
full of love and laughter,

56:53.076 --> 56:55.120
like the one you have known all your life?

56:57.122 --> 56:58.832
You deserve nothing less.

56:59.916 --> 57:03.086
You deserve everything your heart desires.

57:04.212 --> 57:05.672
But I cannot provide it for you.

57:07.549 --> 57:09.926
Nor could I ever ask such a sacrifice.

57:10.552 --> 57:13.263
Please, Daphne, for your own sake…

57:14.806 --> 57:16.182
you must stand aside…

57:17.517 --> 57:19.394
and let your brother finish this.

57:21.229 --> 57:23.523
We must resume
before someone should find us.

57:29.279 --> 57:30.780
There will be no need to resume.

57:36.494 --> 57:38.496
The duke and I are to be married.
