01:17.995 --> 01:19.663
Hey, sheriff.

02:30.025 --> 02:34.320
A Mercury is a real good car.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.615
That was the car
I was driving that day.

02:40.536 --> 02:43.539
I owned a lot of cars.

02:43.622 --> 02:47.084
Yeah, different kinds.

02:47.167 --> 02:51.045
A lot of different kinds of cars.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.841
She was standing, this girl...

02:55.092 --> 02:57.343
on the side of the street
by this chicken stand.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.638
Not the Colonel's,
a different chicken stand.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.599
I pulled the Mercury up alongside...

03:02.683 --> 03:05.936
and rolled down the window
by electric power.

03:06.019 --> 03:10.481
And she had this leather skirt on...

03:10.482 --> 03:13.735
and she had a lot of hair
on her arms.

03:13.819 --> 03:17.030
I like that. It means a big bush,
which I like.

03:20.534 --> 03:25.705
She says, "Are you dating?"
You know?

03:25.706 --> 03:28.207
I said, "Sure."
So she gets in...

03:28.208 --> 03:31.920
and we pull off into...

03:32.045 --> 03:35.423
this remote location
comfortable for both of us.

03:35.424 --> 03:39.135
She says, "How much
do you want to spend?"

03:39.136 --> 03:42.639
I said, "Enough to see
your bush. I know it's big."

03:42.723 --> 03:45.142
She says, "$25."

03:47.936 --> 03:52.941
That's not chicken feed
to a working man.

03:53.025 --> 03:56.236
I produce the $25,
she sticks it in her shoe...

03:56.320 --> 03:58.321
pulls up her skirt...

03:58.322 --> 04:04.203
and there is thin, crooked,
uncircumcised penis.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.794
You can imagine I wanted my $25 back.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.510
Why are you weirded out?

04:19.635 --> 04:22.721
It's not San Quentin.
It's a nut house.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.849
Most patients don't know where
they are. They won't hurt you.

04:25.933 --> 04:29.019
It doesn't bother you we'll be facing
a killer in a few minutes?

04:29.144 --> 04:31.647
You wanted to major in journalism.

04:37.236 --> 04:39.321
They're from that newspaper deal.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.949
- From the college?
- Yes, sir.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.825
- I'm Jerry Woolridge.
- I'm Marsha Dwiggins.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.746
She's Theresa Evans.
She's here to take pictures.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.208
Y'all sit down.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.338
A man named John Leggitt Hunter
had a filling station.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.714
A good filling station business.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.217
He was the type of person
that I'm sure you've met too...

05:01.218 --> 05:03.219
who didn't deserve what he had.

05:03.220 --> 05:08.015
One thing he had was...

05:08.016 --> 05:11.019
this beautiful, young bride,
Sarah.

05:12.938 --> 05:14.939
She was a Georgia peach.

05:14.940 --> 05:20.737
She was more like the picture I had
in my mind than any woman I'd seen.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.116
So I took her away
from John Leggitt Hunter...

05:24.241 --> 05:27.244
who did not deserve her.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.330
Oh, I don't know if I told you...

05:30.414 --> 05:33.542
but he was a Frenchman
who claimed to be an Englishman.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.424
Took strong nylon cord
to get her away from him.

05:40.549 --> 05:43.218
She was a fighter and a Georgia peach.

05:47.723 --> 05:50.517
There must have been a mix-up.

05:51.810 --> 05:55.022
I talked to your sponsor,
teacher or whoever...

05:55.147 --> 05:58.316
and told him no pictures.

05:58.317 --> 06:02.446
This is for an article
or something, right?

06:03.822 --> 06:07.242
Yeah, it's for the school newspaper
which has pictures.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.911
It's a regular paper.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.122
Karl's real sensitive
about having his picture made.

06:12.247 --> 06:15.542
He wouldn't be on the bulletin board
for the Easter collage.

06:18.921 --> 06:21.548
Now...

06:21.632 --> 06:24.510
a shovel just makes
too goddamn much racket.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.230
I'll talk to him, see what he says.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.610
You gotta make something explode
to truly understand it.

06:41.735 --> 06:45.948
You gotta examine all those particles
while they're still on fire.

06:47.950 --> 06:50.911
Karl, let's go down
to the old classroom.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.914
Mr. Woolridge has some people
for you to see.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.918
Let's go.

07:16.228 --> 07:19.814
Remember I told you about
those newspaper people?

07:19.815 --> 07:22.943
They want to ask you questions
about your release.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.946
They think it'll make a good story.

07:26.029 --> 07:29.032
Will you talk to them?
Get interviewed?

07:31.034 --> 07:33.036
They're women.

07:36.331 --> 07:41.711
I think it'd be good for you. You'll see
all kinds of people on the outside.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.714
This'll help.

07:50.429 --> 07:55.641
Now, he'll only talk to you
but you can't ask him anything...

07:55.642 --> 07:57.644
and don't stare at him.

07:57.728 --> 08:00.230
How can I interview him
if I can't ask any questions?

08:00.314 --> 08:02.524
Sorry, that's the best it's gonna get.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.526
Can I ask you a question?

08:04.651 --> 08:07.613
If he's so troubled,
why are you letting him out?

08:07.738 --> 08:10.532
What if he does it again?
It happens.

08:10.616 --> 08:13.410
His time's up.
That's the rules.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.913
He's been treated, reevaluated,
doesn't show any signs anymore.

08:16.914 --> 08:19.750
- Signs?
- Homicidal signs.

08:19.833 --> 08:25.047
Miss, I'm sorry,
but you'll have to step outside.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.633
- Why?
- Please?

08:37.643 --> 08:41.020
I have to change
the light in here for Karl.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.732
I hope you can still see to write.

09:24.940 --> 09:29.111
I reckon what you want to know
is what I'm doing in here.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.947
I reckon it's because I killed somebody.

09:34.533 --> 09:38.120
But I reckon you want to know
how come I killed somebody...

09:38.245 --> 09:40.622
so I'll start at the front
and tell you.

09:44.042 --> 09:48.921
I lived out in back of
my parents' place most of my life...

09:48.922 --> 09:52.843
in a little old shed
that my daddy'd built for me.

09:52.926 --> 09:57.222
They didn't want me in the house
with the rest of them...

09:57.347 --> 10:00.851
so I sat around in the shed
looking at the ground.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.939
I didn't have no floor...

10:06.023 --> 10:10.234
but I had me a hole dug out
to lay down in...

10:10.235 --> 10:12.446
a quilt or two to put down there.

10:15.741 --> 10:17.618
My father...

10:17.743 --> 10:20.912
was a hardworking man
most of his life...

10:20.913 --> 10:24.624
not that I can say the same
for myself.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.044
I mostly just sat around
in the shed...

10:27.127 --> 10:29.213
tinkered around
with a lawn mower or two...

10:30.422 --> 10:34.134
went to school off and on
from time to time.

10:34.218 --> 10:39.431
But the children out there,
they were very cruel to me...

10:39.515 --> 10:43.936
and made quite a bit of sport of me,
made fun of me quite a bit.

10:44.019 --> 10:49.233
So mostly I just sat around
out there in the shed.

10:52.945 --> 10:55.113
My daddy...

10:55.239 --> 10:58.033
worked at the sawmill,
down at the planer mill...

10:58.116 --> 11:00.910
for an old man named Dixon.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.539
Old man Dixon was a very cruel fellow.

11:03.622 --> 11:07.124
Didn't treat his employees well
or pay them well.

11:07.125 --> 11:10.045
Didn't pay my daddy too much of a wage.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.631
Just barely enough to get by,
I reckon.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.176
I reckon he got by all right.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.640
They used to come out,
one or the other of them...

11:23.016 --> 11:25.143
usually my mother...

11:25.227 --> 11:27.521
feed me pretty regular.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.692
So I know he made enough
so I could have mustard and biscuits...

11:31.775 --> 11:34.236
three or four times a week.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.033
But old man Dixon...

11:40.117 --> 11:42.035
he had a boy...

11:43.120 --> 11:45.831
name of Jesse Dixon.

11:45.914 --> 11:49.626
Jesse was more cruel
than his daddy was.

11:49.751 --> 11:53.213
He used to make
quite a bit of sport of me...

11:53.338 --> 11:55.924
when I was down there
at the schoolhouse.

11:58.552 --> 12:02.472
Used to take advantage of the girls
in the neighborhood.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.227
They used to say...

12:08.228 --> 12:11.439
that my mother was a very pretty woman.

12:11.440 --> 12:16.737
They said that quite a bit
when I'd be there at the schoolhouse.

12:16.820 --> 12:21.825
I reckon you want me to get on with it
and tell you what happened.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.827
So I reckon I'll tell you.

12:25.329 --> 12:28.540
I was setting out in the shed
one evening, not doing much...

12:28.624 --> 12:31.126
just staring at the wall...

12:31.251 --> 12:34.296
and waiting on my mother
to give me my Bible lesson.

12:37.716 --> 12:41.345
I heard a commotion in the house...

12:41.428 --> 12:45.015
so I run up on the screened-in porch
to look inside.

12:45.140 --> 12:49.811
I looked in and seen my mother laying
on the floor without any clothes on.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.529
I seen Jesse Dixon
laying on top of her.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.117
He was having his way with her.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.621
I just seen red.

13:11.750 --> 13:15.546
I picked up a Kaiser blade that was
sitting by the door.

13:15.629 --> 13:19.716
Some folks called it a sling blade.
I called it a Kaiser blade.

13:19.842 --> 13:23.846
It's got a long, wood handle,
kind of like an ax handle...

13:23.929 --> 13:26.849
with a long blade shaped like a banana.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.644
Sharp on one edge
and dull on the other.

13:31.937 --> 13:36.400
It's what the highway boys use
to cut down weeds and whatnot. Yeah.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.238
I went in the house...

13:42.239 --> 13:45.117
and I hit Jesse Dixon
upside the head with it...

13:45.242 --> 13:47.119
knocked him off my mother.

13:48.537 --> 13:51.707
I reckon that didn't satisfy me...

13:53.584 --> 13:56.128
so I hit him again in the neck
with the sharp edge...

13:56.253 --> 13:59.840
and just plumb near cut his head off,
killed him.

14:02.634 --> 14:05.053
My mother jumped up
and started hollering...

14:05.137 --> 14:08.098
"What did you kill Jesse for?"

14:08.182 --> 14:10.934
Well, come to find out...

14:11.018 --> 14:14.021
my mother didn't mind
what Jesse was doing to her.

14:15.647 --> 14:19.526
That made me madder
than what Jesse'd made me...

14:19.651 --> 14:21.945
so I took the Kaiser blade...

14:22.029 --> 14:25.324
Some folks called it a sling blade,
I called it a Kaiser blade...

14:27.826 --> 14:30.245
And I hit my mother
upside the head with it.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.167
Killed her.

14:40.130 --> 14:45.761
Some folks asked me:
if you had it to do over again,
would you do it the same way?

14:46.094 --> 14:48.096
I reckon I would.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.017
Anyhow, they put me in here...

14:52.351 --> 14:55.479
and here I been
for a great, long while.

14:58.190 --> 15:00.067
I've learned to read some.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.654
Took me four years to read the Bible.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.823
I reckon I understand
a great deal of it.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.494
Wasn't what I expected
in some places.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.707
I've slept in a good bed
for a great, long while.

15:17.835 --> 15:20.336
Now they've seen fit
to put me out of here.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.965
They say they're setting me free today.

15:26.510 --> 15:29.137
I reckon that's all you was
needing to know.

15:30.973 --> 15:34.935
You want more details.
I reckon I can tell them.

15:35.018 --> 15:38.188
I don't know whether that's enough
for your newspaper or not.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.692
Will you ever kill again, Karl?

15:53.036 --> 15:56.331
I don't reckon I got no reason
to kill nobody.

16:07.176 --> 16:09.678
- Where will he go?
- Anywhere he wants.

16:09.803 --> 16:13.515
I think he's going to Millsburg where
he's from, about 20 miles from here.

16:13.599 --> 16:17.686
- Will he be supervised?
- As much as anybody, I guess.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.813
Y'all have a nice day, now.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.483
I'll get Melvin to walk y'all out.

16:28.113 --> 16:30.490
Would you walk these girls out?

16:32.784 --> 16:34.578
Thank you.

16:46.798 --> 16:51.011
I reckon I'll have to get used to
looking at pretty people.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.013
Guess you will.

16:54.181 --> 16:57.184
Reckon I'll have to get used to them
looking at me too.

16:59.561 --> 17:02.064
Better go get your things.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.066
Ain't got nothing but them books.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.069
Better go get them.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.031
All right, then.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.087
All right, then.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.401
Can I help you?

20:00.200 --> 20:03.287
I was kinda wanting
something to eat.

20:03.412 --> 20:05.414
Well, what would you like?

20:07.499 --> 20:10.209
You got any biscuits in there?

20:10.210 --> 20:13.547
No, this is a Frosty Cream.
We don't serve biscuits.

20:13.714 --> 20:15.591
We got a lot of other stuff.

20:15.716 --> 20:18.301
What you got in there
that's good to eat?

20:18.302 --> 20:20.888
We got Big Chief Burgers,
Bongo Burgers...

20:21.013 --> 20:24.516
Foot-longs, Corny Dogs,
Frosty Shakes, Creamy Bars.

20:24.558 --> 20:27.686
Did you want me to go through
the whole list?

20:28.478 --> 20:30.981
What do you like?

20:32.441 --> 20:37.738
Well, the french fries are pretty good.

20:37.905 --> 20:41.617
- French fried potatoes?
- Yep, french fries.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.288
How much you want for them?

20:46.371 --> 20:49.791
They're 60 for medium
and 75 for large.

20:53.504 --> 20:56.048
I reckon I'll have me
some of the big ones.

20:56.215 --> 20:58.300
All right.
One large french fries?

21:39.758 --> 21:41.718
These darn things are heavy.

21:41.885 --> 21:44.387
Hard to carry too.

21:44.388 --> 21:47.015
- You got wash in there?
- Yeah.

21:48.767 --> 21:51.894
Can't your mama and daddy tend to it?

21:51.895 --> 21:56.441
I got a mama but she's at work
at Hoochy's Dollar Store.

21:56.608 --> 22:00.112
My daddy's dead.
He got hit by a train.

22:02.698 --> 22:05.450
How far you going
with them sacks full of wash?

22:05.617 --> 22:07.452
Half a mile, I think.

22:09.288 --> 22:12.082
I can help you tote it
if I don't give out first.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.501
Okay, but you don't have to.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.797
All right, then.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.887
My name's Frank Wheatley.
What's yours?

22:25.012 --> 22:27.305
Karl's my name.

22:27.306 --> 22:29.391
- What's your last name?
- Childers.

22:31.602 --> 22:33.812
What are all them books?

22:33.896 --> 22:35.814
Oh, different ones.

22:35.898 --> 22:38.317
One's the Bible, one's a book
on Christmas...

22:38.400 --> 22:40.903
one's on how to be a carpenter.

22:40.986 --> 22:45.282
- Why do you carry them around?
- Ain't got no place to set them down.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.492
Don't you live somewhere?

22:47.618 --> 22:50.370
Did live at the state hospital.

22:50.495 --> 22:54.541
- Why?
- I killed some folks a while back.

22:54.708 --> 22:57.878
They said I wasn't right in the head so
they put me in the nervous hospital...

22:58.003 --> 23:00.380
instead of putting me in jail.

23:00.506 --> 23:03.049
- They let you out?
- Yeah.

23:03.050 --> 23:06.720
- How come?
- They told me I was well.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.806
Had to turn me loose.

23:09.890 --> 23:13.185
- Are you well?
- I reckon I feel all right.

23:16.063 --> 23:18.065
This here's my house.

23:21.068 --> 23:24.738
You don't seem like you killed nobody.

23:24.905 --> 23:27.198
We can just
set these bags on the porch.

23:27.199 --> 23:29.201
All right, then.

23:45.092 --> 23:47.719
You like to play football?

23:47.761 --> 23:51.265
I never was no account at it,
never got picked out for it.

23:52.766 --> 23:54.685
Me and the Barnett twins
and some boys...

23:54.768 --> 23:57.895
play at the junior high school field
all the time.

23:57.896 --> 24:01.191
You want to play, come on over
'cause we ain't no good either.

24:02.276 --> 24:04.277
I'll see you later.

24:04.278 --> 24:06.280
All right, then.

25:01.543 --> 25:03.545
Hon, you can't just go in there.

25:05.005 --> 25:07.299
What in the world are you doing here?

25:07.382 --> 25:09.301
I want to come back and stay in here.

25:11.011 --> 25:13.180
You can't. You're a free man.

25:13.305 --> 25:16.183
They let you out so you can
do as you please.

25:16.308 --> 25:18.894
I reckon I don't care
about being a free man.

25:19.019 --> 25:21.522
I don't know how to go about it.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.482
You'll have to learn.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.816
It'll take some time.

25:25.817 --> 25:28.695
Don't you have anybody
to help you out?

25:28.820 --> 25:30.906
No, sir.

25:30.989 --> 25:34.493
Your daddy was living there
last time I heard.

25:34.576 --> 25:38.997
I guess he wouldn't want to
help you out any, would he?

25:40.415 --> 25:42.251
Sorry. I wasn't thinking.

25:45.212 --> 25:47.506
Don't you have anybody?

25:47.589 --> 25:52.594
No, sir. Never did know
too much of nobody down there.

25:52.719 --> 25:55.013
Not to be helping me out,
no way.

25:57.891 --> 25:59.893
Karl, the truth is...

26:01.103 --> 26:04.897
I don't know where they expect you
to go, what they expect you to do.

26:04.898 --> 26:09.611
If I could, I'd let you come back here
and stay if you wanted to.

26:09.695 --> 26:12.447
I'm just doing my job.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.449
You follow me?

26:17.995 --> 26:20.581
Listen, Karl, I know an old boy...

26:20.706 --> 26:24.083
who's got a fix-it shop deal
in Millsburg.

26:24.084 --> 26:26.086
He used to go to church with me.

26:28.422 --> 26:31.008
You're good working on
small engines and things.

26:31.091 --> 26:35.303
If I was to put my neck out
for you with him...

26:35.304 --> 26:38.182
do you think you could work it
if he'll hire you?

26:40.392 --> 26:44.313
I'm pretty handy, I reckon,
on lawn mowers and whatnot.

26:44.354 --> 26:47.398
I know you are.
I've seen it myself.

26:47.399 --> 26:50.110
- Could you give it a try?
- I reckon.

26:52.070 --> 26:55.282
Now I can't promise
that he'll hire you.

26:55.407 --> 26:57.618
I'll have to tell him
about your history.

26:59.453 --> 27:02.372
I never was no good with history.

27:02.497 --> 27:05.000
No. I mean your past.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.880
Why you were in here.

27:11.298 --> 27:13.717
Take you down first thing
in the morning.

27:15.385 --> 27:17.679
You don't have
anywhere to stay tonight at all?

27:18.847 --> 27:19.848
No, sir.

27:19.973 --> 27:22.308
It's against the rules
for you to stay here.

27:22.309 --> 27:25.395
If something happened,
I'd be liable.

27:28.190 --> 27:32.819
I reckon I can walk around till
morning time, sit and read a book.

27:51.171 --> 27:54.007
Karl, would you like a muffin?

27:54.091 --> 27:56.009
No, thank you.

27:59.763 --> 28:03.183
So Jerry's taking you
someplace else tomorrow.

28:04.685 --> 28:07.187
I don't know nobody named Jerry.

28:08.188 --> 28:10.440
That's me, Karl. That's my first name.

28:12.192 --> 28:14.695
He's carrying me to look for work
down in Millsburg...

28:14.778 --> 28:16.697
where I was born.

28:19.241 --> 28:21.159
Would you like some coffee?

28:21.243 --> 28:25.414
Coffee makes me a mite nervous
when I drink it.

28:25.998 --> 28:27.875
Daddy, can I go to bed?

28:28.000 --> 28:31.003
Sure. You sleep
with your mama tonight.

28:31.086 --> 28:33.964
I'm sleeping with your brother
so Karl can have your room.

28:34.089 --> 28:35.591
Why?

28:37.092 --> 28:38.969
Because he's company.

28:51.273 --> 28:53.775
- Karl, you up?
- Yes, sir.

28:58.488 --> 28:59.865
Didn't you sleep?

28:59.990 --> 29:02.701
You been sitting there
like that all night?

29:02.743 --> 29:04.827
Yes, sir.

29:04.828 --> 29:06.997
Come on. We'd better hit the road.

29:08.123 --> 29:10.459
All right, then.

30:03.345 --> 30:05.264
Jerry, how's it going?

30:05.389 --> 30:07.682
- Hey, Bill.
- Good to see you.

30:07.683 --> 30:11.228
- Good to see you. How's everyone doing?
- Pretty good.

30:11.395 --> 30:14.165
Kids are driving me crazy, and Phyliss
is putting me in the poor house...

30:14.189 --> 30:15.899
but I can't complain otherwise.

30:15.941 --> 30:18.902
Wouldn't do any good anyway.
You know Scooter?

30:18.944 --> 30:21.113
Don't believe I do.
Good to meet you, Scooter.

30:21.196 --> 30:23.448
How about you?

30:23.574 --> 30:25.909
Well, this is the one I was
telling you about on the phone.

30:26.076 --> 30:29.997
If you get nervous, I'll understand,
but I'm not going to lie to you.

30:30.122 --> 30:32.207
He got into that trouble,
but he was young.

30:32.291 --> 30:36.712
I remember. He cut them
to pieces, and one was his mama.

30:36.795 --> 30:38.714
And that Dixon boy.

30:38.797 --> 30:42.717
Hell, I always wanted to kill him.
He was an asshole.

30:42.718 --> 30:44.803
I remember him too.

30:44.887 --> 30:48.098
Kinda retarded or something
back in school.

30:48.182 --> 30:52.311
Seems like he's pretty
well-adjusted these days.

30:52.394 --> 30:54.688
I don't think he'd ever hurt anybody.

30:54.730 --> 30:59.860
He don't look much like he would.
And he can fix a small engine real good?

30:59.985 --> 31:02.653
He's a whiz. It's all he's done
since he was a kid.

31:02.654 --> 31:06.909
- You scared of him, Scooter?
- No, I don't guess so.

31:06.992 --> 31:09.077
- Can he talk?
- Oh, yeah.

31:09.203 --> 31:11.829
You say he can stay
out in the back?

31:11.830 --> 31:13.874
Fine with me. If he steals anything...

31:13.999 --> 31:16.000
I'll take it out of your pocket.

31:16.001 --> 31:19.712
He won't steal. He's a good old boy.
Keeps to himself.

31:19.713 --> 31:22.883
I got a room full of work.
Scooter won't do it.

31:24.510 --> 31:26.345
Karl, come over here.

31:26.470 --> 31:28.680
I want you to meet your new boss.

31:28.764 --> 31:31.558
This is Bill Cox.
He runs the place.

31:31.683 --> 31:34.394
Says you can work here,
stay out back.

31:34.478 --> 31:37.856
- It's good to know you, Karl.
- Thank you.

31:38.023 --> 31:42.694
It's minimum wage. There's nothing back
there but an army cot and a toilet.

31:42.819 --> 31:46.072
That's fine. I'll go to the car
and get your books.

31:46.073 --> 31:48.075
All right, then.

31:51.203 --> 31:54.206
They say you're a whiz on fixing
lawn mowers and things.

31:55.707 --> 31:59.669
I've tinkered around
on them a bit.

31:59.670 --> 32:02.923
We order from the Frosty Cream
at lunch, usually.

32:03.006 --> 32:05.342
We'll buy you lunch
till you get on your feet.

32:06.760 --> 32:09.012
I like them
french fried potatoes.

32:11.098 --> 32:13.016
Yeah. Me too.

32:15.394 --> 32:18.021
They make a good double meat burger.

32:31.577 --> 32:33.787
All right, then.
I'll see y'all later.

32:33.912 --> 32:37.291
Karl, you done good work.
They was right about you.

32:37.416 --> 32:40.878
Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of
a job if you're not careful.

32:41.003 --> 32:43.212
- I'll see y'all tomorrow.
- Wait up.

32:43.213 --> 32:45.215
I'll leave with you and lock up.

32:47.092 --> 32:51.804
There's a blanket under the cot, soap
in the bathroom for cleaning up.

32:51.805 --> 32:55.893
One more thing. The way we lock
these doors, you can't get out at night.

32:55.976 --> 32:59.563
- Did you want to go anywhere?
- I don't reckon.

32:59.646 --> 33:03.483
If it works out, we'll get you a key so
you can get out at night.

33:03.567 --> 33:05.694
- I'll see you later.
- All right, then.

33:29.384 --> 33:32.763
Did I tell you the one about the two
old boys pissing off the bridge?

33:32.846 --> 33:34.347
I don't remember.

33:34.348 --> 33:39.394
These two old boys hung their peckers
off a bridge to piss.

33:39.520 --> 33:42.897
One was from California,
one from Arkansas.

33:42.898 --> 33:46.068
Old boy from California says,
"Boy, this water's cold."

33:46.193 --> 33:48.862
Old boy from Arkansas says,
"Yeah, and it's deep too."

33:52.491 --> 33:54.159
Get it?

33:54.326 --> 33:57.703
- Yeah, that's a good one.
- That is a good one.

33:57.704 --> 34:02.167
I do believe you told me that before.
I've heard it a bunch.

34:02.334 --> 34:06.463
- A long time ago.
- Yeah, that's a classic.

34:06.505 --> 34:12.009
Karl, I've been thinking, and it's not
Christian of me to keep locking you in.

34:12.010 --> 34:14.763
You've been in lockup so long,
you don't need me to keep doing it.

34:14.888 --> 34:17.391
You need to come and go as you please.
Here.

34:19.101 --> 34:21.978
Take this key. It'll get you
in and out of here at night.

34:25.023 --> 34:26.775
All right, then.

34:29.069 --> 34:32.447
- Them french fries good?
- They's good, all right.

34:34.533 --> 34:36.577
You got any money?

34:37.703 --> 34:40.289
They give me some
when they turned me loose.

34:42.081 --> 34:45.918
I spent some riding the bus,
eating french fried potatoes.

34:47.880 --> 34:51.382
I'm going to pay you today
for this coming week...

34:51.507 --> 34:53.969
so you have some walking-around money.

34:54.094 --> 34:58.974
You need to buy some toothpaste and
cleaning up supplies to have back there.

34:59.099 --> 35:02.477
Get you some magazines
and some hard candy...

35:02.603 --> 35:06.272
something to keep you busy
at night.

35:06.273 --> 35:08.233
All right, then.

35:08.358 --> 35:10.694
I'll let you off
while it's still daylight.

35:43.227 --> 35:47.648
I thought I heard somebody on the porch.
Wasn't your name Karl?

35:49.399 --> 35:52.653
Yes, sir, it is.
You're named Frank.

35:53.403 --> 35:56.822
Yeah. What are you doing by here?

35:56.823 --> 36:00.536
- You said for me to come by.
- Wanna play ball with us?

36:01.495 --> 36:05.749
I ain't no good at it.
I just come by to see you.

36:05.916 --> 36:10.671
I was going to see my mama at Hoochy's
Dollar Store. She works 2:00 to 8:00.

36:11.213 --> 36:14.007
All right, then.

36:14.091 --> 36:16.593
You want to go with me?
You can meet my mama.

36:18.679 --> 36:21.264
I ought not worry your mama
with company.

36:21.265 --> 36:25.269
Come on. You'll like her.
She's real nice.

36:25.394 --> 36:29.147
She'll give us anything we want her to,
candy or something.

36:30.899 --> 36:33.902
I was needing to do some trading.

36:34.027 --> 36:36.113
Reckon they sell toothpaste?

36:36.196 --> 36:39.365
Yeah, they sell a little bit
of everything.

36:39.366 --> 36:43.453
I won't tell her about you being in
the state hospital for killing.

36:43.620 --> 36:45.497
Come on. Let's go.

37:00.721 --> 37:03.599
You have to learn to live
without all that grease.

37:03.682 --> 37:06.894
Here in the South,
I like grease in everything.

37:07.019 --> 37:10.606
I like fried chicken, fried okra,
biscuits and gravy.

37:10.772 --> 37:12.565
- It will kill you.
- Hey, Mama, Vaughan.

37:12.566 --> 37:15.027
- What you up to, sweetheart?
- I bet I know.

37:15.110 --> 37:17.821
- You want candy and pop, right?
- Yeah.

37:17.905 --> 37:21.200
That rots your teeth.
I've got something better.

37:21.325 --> 37:23.702
Potted meat is on special...
Four cans for a dollar.

37:23.785 --> 37:29.373
They're not selling but I'll give
the right kid some for free.

37:29.374 --> 37:31.334
I don't like potted meat.

37:31.335 --> 37:34.796
Daddy said it was made from lips,
peckers and intestines.

37:34.880 --> 37:39.051
Don't talk that way. Did that
strange-looking man follow you in here?

37:40.844 --> 37:42.262
Can I help you?

37:42.930 --> 37:46.558
That's Karl. I met him
at the laundry mat.

37:46.725 --> 37:49.352
Karl, this is Mama and Vaughan.

37:49.353 --> 37:51.522
Vaughan is the manager.

37:51.563 --> 37:55.776
He lets Mama off work anytime
because they're best friends.

37:55.901 --> 37:57.819
Nice to meet you, Karl.

37:59.154 --> 38:01.323
Pleased to meet you.

38:04.451 --> 38:07.913
Frank, come back here with me
for a minute.

38:13.710 --> 38:15.712
I haven't seen you here before.

38:17.214 --> 38:21.093
No, sir, I don't reckon you have.
I haven't been in here before.

38:21.176 --> 38:24.720
This store didn't used to be here.

38:24.721 --> 38:29.225
It's been here 17 years.
Did you live here before?

38:29.226 --> 38:32.104
I was born and raised here till
I was 12 years old.

38:33.522 --> 38:36.775
- What brings you back?
- What's that you say?

38:38.861 --> 38:41.904
Why are you here now?

38:41.905 --> 38:44.783
They turned me loose from
the state hospital.

38:44.908 --> 38:49.454
Is that right?
How long are you staying?

38:49.621 --> 38:54.126
Mr. Woolridge got me hired
at Bill Cox's outfit.

38:55.252 --> 38:58.212
- You have family here?
- Not to speak of.

38:58.213 --> 39:02.925
Hey, Karl. Guess what?
Mama said you can stay in our garage.

39:02.926 --> 39:06.096
Our car doesn't fit anyway.
It's real neat.

39:06.180 --> 39:09.808
Frank told me about your situation.
Frank loves company.

39:09.892 --> 39:12.311
Especially after his daddy passed
and all.

39:12.394 --> 39:15.898
There's no sense in you staying
in that greasy old shop.

39:15.981 --> 39:18.192
He's mentally retarded,
poor thing.

39:18.317 --> 39:21.111
- He just go out of the state hospital.
- I know.

39:21.195 --> 39:23.822
- Can we get some candy and pop?
- Sure. Go ahead.

39:23.864 --> 39:25.782
Come on.

39:27.075 --> 39:31.204
- Is it safe to let him around that guy?
- Frank's crazy about him.

39:31.205 --> 39:35.209
He likes the way he talks and he helped
Frank carry home the laundry.

39:35.292 --> 39:38.629
He's been in the hospital a long time.
There must be something wrong with him.

39:38.712 --> 39:41.798
He's retarded. Frank's always after
a father figure.

39:41.882 --> 39:44.218
Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one
with his mean ass.

39:44.301 --> 39:47.971
- What about me?
- He doesn't see you as a "guy" guy.

39:48.055 --> 39:50.057
Karl's a "guy" guy?

40:09.034 --> 40:11.203
I call this my secret place.

40:11.411 --> 40:14.665
I come out here when I feel like
being alone.

40:14.748 --> 40:16.750
I used to come here with Karen Cross.

40:16.917 --> 40:20.753
She kind of used to be my girlfriend.

40:20.754 --> 40:23.757
We would come out here
and hold hands and talk...

40:23.924 --> 40:27.260
and read books to each other
with a flashlight.

40:27.261 --> 40:30.221
She wouldn't have nothing to do with me
in front of other people...

40:30.222 --> 40:34.267
because Mama and I
don't have any money.

40:34.268 --> 40:37.271
Her daddy's a dentist,
so they're rich.

40:37.980 --> 40:40.607
Was your folks well off?

40:40.691 --> 40:45.279
No, we barely had enough
to scrape by on, I reckon.

40:45.362 --> 40:48.281
Your folks still around?

40:48.282 --> 40:50.324
My mother's dead.

40:50.325 --> 40:54.912
My daddy's still around but he don't
want to have nothing to do with me.

40:54.913 --> 40:58.708
- How do you know?
- He never did want to.

40:58.709 --> 41:02.629
I figure he probably
ain't changed his mind much.

41:02.713 --> 41:04.590
How'd your mama die?

41:07.217 --> 41:09.468
You don't need to hear
things like that.

41:09.469 --> 41:11.555
You just a boy.

41:11.722 --> 41:14.766
You need to think good thoughts
while you still a boy.

41:14.892 --> 41:18.103
There's lots of time for all the other.

41:18.228 --> 41:20.898
I had bad thoughts since Daddy died.

41:21.023 --> 41:25.318
Sometimes I wish I was still little
and he was still here.

41:25.319 --> 41:28.197
Mama's real good, but I wish
I had both of them.

41:28.280 --> 41:30.824
We went to Memphis in the car once.

41:30.908 --> 41:33.493
It was raining so hard
we couldn't see the road...

41:33.577 --> 41:36.329
but I wasn't scared because
as long as Daddy was driving...

41:36.330 --> 41:38.373
nothing could happen to us.

41:38.498 --> 41:40.626
That's the way I feel about Mama now.

41:43.295 --> 41:45.380
Mama has a boyfriend now.

41:45.506 --> 41:48.383
His name is Doyle Hargraves.

41:48.509 --> 41:51.220
He works construction so he makes
a pretty good living...

41:51.261 --> 41:54.056
but he don't help Mama out
with any money.

41:54.223 --> 41:58.519
He ain't no good. He's mean to her.
He don't like me at all.

41:58.560 --> 42:03.065
Mama says he's jealous
because I belong to my daddy.

42:03.148 --> 42:08.070
He spends the night at our house
and he's got his own house.

42:08.153 --> 42:11.490
Somebody told me this way
he can have more girlfriends.

42:11.532 --> 42:15.202
I like the nights he's not there.
I ain't so nervous then.

42:18.205 --> 42:22.416
How come she's still being girlfriends
with him if he's mean to her?

42:22.417 --> 42:25.254
She says it's for the times
he's good to her.

42:25.420 --> 42:27.256
She's lonely since Daddy died.

42:27.422 --> 42:29.925
Sometimes she don't know why.

42:30.008 --> 42:32.511
He threatened to kill her
if she left him.

42:32.594 --> 42:37.265
My daddy would kill him if he was here
and somebody was mean to Mama.

42:37.266 --> 42:39.393
Vaughan's real good to Mama.

42:39.476 --> 42:41.395
Vaughan that you met?

42:41.520 --> 42:44.773
But he's not able to do anything
to Doyle. He's funny.

42:44.898 --> 42:47.024
Not "funny," ha-ha.
"Funny," queer.

42:47.025 --> 42:49.194
He likes to go with men.

42:49.278 --> 42:54.115
That makes him not able to fight good,
but he sure is nice.

42:54.116 --> 42:58.453
He's from St. Louis. Queer people
get along better in a big town.

42:58.620 --> 43:00.998
I wish he like to go with women.

43:01.123 --> 43:04.084
I'd rather him be Mama's boyfriend
than Doyle.

43:05.502 --> 43:10.006
Karl, remember I told you Daddy
got hit by a train?

43:10.007 --> 43:12.092
Yes, sir, I recollect that.

43:13.510 --> 43:17.222
It ain't the truth. He shot himself
with a shotgun on purpose.

43:18.724 --> 43:20.601
How come him do that?

43:22.311 --> 43:26.105
Because he didn't have enough money
to take care of us like he wanted to.

43:26.106 --> 43:28.108
That's what the letter said.

43:28.192 --> 43:31.820
He got laid off of work
and did odd jobs.

43:31.904 --> 43:34.198
I thought he took care of us
just fine.

43:39.995 --> 43:43.707
Karl, did you really kill somebody?

43:43.790 --> 43:45.374
Yes, sir, I did.

43:45.375 --> 43:48.378
- Who'd you kill?
- Two people.

43:48.504 --> 43:51.507
- Were they bad people?
- I thought they was.

43:53.217 --> 43:55.219
Maybe they needed it.

43:56.303 --> 44:01.808
I growed up and learned that you ain't
supposed to kill nobody.

44:01.892 --> 44:05.896
It's okay if you're protecting yourself,
if it's self-defense.

44:05.979 --> 44:08.315
Was it self-defense?

44:11.527 --> 44:13.528
My daddy was good.

44:13.529 --> 44:16.072
I think too many good people die.

44:16.073 --> 44:18.033
That's what I think.

44:41.014 --> 44:43.392
You sure you wanna
stay with these folks?

44:43.517 --> 44:47.395
You're welcome to stay here.
It's working out good.

44:47.396 --> 44:50.274
That boy wants me to.

44:50.399 --> 44:53.235
All right, then.
I'll see you bright and early.

44:53.402 --> 44:55.403
How's that garden tiller coming?

44:55.404 --> 44:58.197
I fixed it.
It's working pretty good now.

44:58.198 --> 45:00.783
You done fixed it?
I'll be damned.

45:00.784 --> 45:02.870
Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed.

45:02.995 --> 45:06.623
Of course, Scooter's about as shiftless
as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be.

45:06.707 --> 45:10.419
You done fixed it.
Well, I'll just be damned.

45:10.502 --> 45:13.297
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, then.

45:22.014 --> 45:25.516
I don't guess I'll give a shit, then.
I ain't here that much.

45:25.517 --> 45:29.313
If you want a retard living
in your garage, that's your business.

45:29.396 --> 45:32.691
I do got some tools
I'd rather not have stoled.

45:32.774 --> 45:34.817
I could take those home with me.

45:34.818 --> 45:37.029
He's real honest.
He wouldn't steal nothing.

45:37.112 --> 45:40.991
Frankie, I wasn't talking to you,
was l?

45:41.116 --> 45:43.202
- No, sir.
- "No, sir" is right.

45:43.327 --> 45:46.705
I was talking to your mama.
It's her decision, not yours.

45:46.830 --> 45:49.625
If I let it go on,
it's because she asked me, not you.

45:53.128 --> 45:57.216
Does this retard drool
and rub shit in his hair and all that?

45:57.299 --> 46:00.510
I'm going to have a hard time eating
around that kind of thing.

46:00.511 --> 46:03.012
Just like with antique furniture
and midgets.

46:03.013 --> 46:07.518
I can't so much as drink a glass of
water around a midget or an antique.

46:07.559 --> 46:10.020
Doyle, you're awful.
You shouldn't be that way.

46:10.062 --> 46:15.567
I ain't saying it's right. It's just
the truth. He'll make me sick.

46:15.692 --> 46:19.905
- What was he in the nut house for?
- He's just retarded, I guess.

46:20.030 --> 46:24.201
No, he had of gone nuts
and did something.

46:24.326 --> 46:27.579
A lot of retards running around that
ain't locked up in the nut house.

46:27.704 --> 46:30.081
Think about it, Linda.

46:30.082 --> 46:32.208
You know what he done, Frank?

46:32.209 --> 46:35.420
- I ain't sure.
- You oughta want to find out.

46:35.504 --> 46:38.423
He might have hacked his family
to pieces with a hatchet or something.

46:38.507 --> 46:40.425
Frank, you'd better ask him.

46:40.509 --> 46:43.761
Don't hurt his feelings,
but it would be good to know.

46:43.762 --> 46:46.014
I'm sure it's nothing.
He seems sweet.

46:47.516 --> 46:50.269
You're all hung up
on people being sweet.

46:50.394 --> 46:54.272
He's sweet. Everybody's sweet. Speaking
of sweet, where's your girlfriend?

46:54.273 --> 46:57.276
- I thought he was coming over.
- He'll be here in a while.

46:57.401 --> 47:01.195
- We're going for ice cream.
- Now ain't that sweet.

47:01.196 --> 47:04.198
What do I do about supper while you're
running around with that fag?

47:04.199 --> 47:06.994
You're not crippled.
Go make something.

47:07.119 --> 47:09.620
Talking back and everything,
aren't you?

47:09.621 --> 47:11.831
That makes me horny.

47:11.832 --> 47:15.711
Frank, go and play in your room,
if Doyle's going to talk nasty.

47:15.794 --> 47:19.923
- I don't want to go play.
- He don't want to. Let him stay.

47:20.007 --> 47:25.929
Let's be a family till your mentally
retarded and homosexual friends arrive.

47:39.902 --> 47:41.904
Yes, sir?

47:42.613 --> 47:45.823
You're really going to stay here.

47:45.824 --> 47:49.118
That boy wants me to.

47:49.119 --> 47:51.121
Have you knocked yet?

47:52.623 --> 47:55.375
- No, sir, I ain't.
- How long have you been here?

47:57.794 --> 48:00.506
Quite a spell, I reckon.

48:00.631 --> 48:05.302
Before you get used to staying here,
we need to talk about a few things.

48:05.385 --> 48:07.721
Can I take you to lunch?

48:07.804 --> 48:10.015
I done ate a little bit ago.

48:10.057 --> 48:12.726
I mean tomorrow or the next day.

48:15.020 --> 48:18.023
I reckon I could eat something
at noontime.

48:19.233 --> 48:22.528
Bill Cox generally gets me
a box lunch...

48:22.569 --> 48:26.406
but I reckon he can
lay off doing it tomorrow.

48:26.532 --> 48:31.328
Then I'll come by and
pick you up around noon, all right?

48:31.411 --> 48:33.413
All right, then.

48:37.334 --> 48:39.211
There's your girlfriend.

48:43.715 --> 48:45.717
Y'all come on in.

48:47.010 --> 48:49.513
Come on. Have a seat in here.

48:52.224 --> 48:55.102
- Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
- Tolerable, I reckon.

48:55.227 --> 49:00.774
Karl, this is Doyle. Frank, you and Karl
go fix him up a place in the garage.

49:00.899 --> 49:03.026
- Vaughan, you ready to go?
- Sure.

49:03.110 --> 49:05.028
Honey, don't rush everybody off.

49:05.112 --> 49:08.615
- You and Karl want to go with us?
- I don't want to.

49:08.699 --> 49:11.033
We got things we need to do.

49:11.034 --> 49:13.328
Vaughan, you know what I heard?

49:13.412 --> 49:16.707
That you been putting it on Albert
Sellers over at the funeral home.

49:16.832 --> 49:20.919
- I know Albert. We're friends.
- I heard you was more than friends.

49:21.003 --> 49:25.632
I heard Dick Rivers caught you two
going at it in the same room...

49:25.716 --> 49:29.303
with poor old Mrs. Ogletree and her dead
as a doornail laid out on a gurney.

49:29.428 --> 49:32.598
- That's ridiculous, a total lie.
- Let's go, Vaughan.

49:32.723 --> 49:35.099
We'll be back in a while.
I'll bring you something.

49:35.100 --> 49:40.105
- Your food's in the oven warming over.
- You fixed him something.

49:40.230 --> 49:45.027
Vaughan, I was just going on with you.
Just joking around. You know, buddy.

49:45.110 --> 49:47.529
I know. You're a real card.

49:51.700 --> 49:54.203
Karl, come over,
sit down and talk to me.

50:04.296 --> 50:06.507
Come on, Karl.
Let's go to the garage.

50:06.632 --> 50:09.134
Goddammit. I want to talk to him.

50:09.218 --> 50:11.220
Sit down, Karl.

50:16.808 --> 50:19.019
What's in your bag?

50:23.023 --> 50:26.235
This and that.
Toothpaste and whatnot.

50:28.403 --> 50:32.199
- What's all them books?
- Different ones.

50:33.033 --> 50:35.577
One of them's the Bible.

50:35.702 --> 50:37.913
You believe in the Bible, Karl?

50:39.081 --> 50:41.583
Yes, sir. A good deal of it.

50:41.708 --> 50:44.211
I can't understand all of it.

50:45.754 --> 50:48.256
I can't understand none of it.

50:48.257 --> 50:51.092
This one begat that one,
that one begat this one...

50:51.093 --> 50:56.014
and begat and begat and lo and behold
someone says some shit to someone.

50:56.098 --> 50:58.599
- How retarded are you?
- Stop it, Doyle.

50:58.600 --> 51:03.230
Frankie, be quiet. We're talking.
The adults are talking.

51:05.399 --> 51:09.111
Was you in lockup for cutting someone
with a hatchet or something?

51:11.613 --> 51:15.409
I ain't never used no hatchet
that I remember.

51:15.534 --> 51:18.620
So you're just crazy
in a retard kind of way then?

51:20.330 --> 51:23.499
It wouldn't matter to me
if you did do violence.

51:23.500 --> 51:26.211
I ain't scared of shit.

51:26.295 --> 51:29.423
You think I'm scared
for you to stay here?

51:29.506 --> 51:32.217
You just a humped-over retard.

51:38.015 --> 51:42.810
I'm just kidding you.
Welcome to our humble home, buddy.

51:42.811 --> 51:45.606
Frank needs
all the friends he can get.

51:46.231 --> 51:48.817
Frank's a weak little kid.

51:48.901 --> 51:51.195
His daddy taught him
how to be a pussy.

51:51.320 --> 51:53.405
Don't talk about my daddy.

51:56.867 --> 52:00.204
Go on out to the garage.
Leave me be.

52:00.829 --> 52:02.830
Go on.

52:02.831 --> 52:04.833
Come on, Karl.

52:17.554 --> 52:20.891
Don't say nothing
about our little spat to your mama.

52:21.016 --> 52:22.893
I don't want her worrying.

52:27.064 --> 52:30.567
I'd like to kill that son-of-a-bitch.
I hate him.

52:32.236 --> 52:35.572
You ought not talk that away.
You just a boy.

52:35.697 --> 52:37.699
Well, I hate him.

52:37.824 --> 52:40.576
He ought not talk that away
to you neither.

52:40.577 --> 52:43.914
He ain't no account. He's mean
to you and your mama.

52:46.583 --> 52:49.395
Your mama and that fellow that's
carrying me to get something to eat's...

52:49.419 --> 52:52.089
going to be back directly.

52:52.214 --> 52:55.259
Will you be here with us
for a long time?

52:55.425 --> 52:57.511
I reckon, if you want me to.

52:59.721 --> 53:04.601
I got some of that potted meat
and soda crackers if you want some.

53:04.726 --> 53:09.606
How can you eat all that stuff
with them insides it's made out of?

53:09.731 --> 53:12.025
I reckon it tastes
pretty good to me.

53:13.902 --> 53:16.697
I like the way you talk.

53:16.780 --> 53:19.324
Well, I like the way you talk.

53:22.202 --> 53:25.414
You think it's really got
peckers in there?

53:25.497 --> 53:28.333
You know better than to say that word.

53:30.919 --> 53:33.129
It smells kinda funny.

53:33.130 --> 53:36.132
It's a little loud.
Looky right here.

53:36.133 --> 53:39.136
I believe you right.
I believe I see one in there.

53:46.226 --> 53:48.020
Thank you, sir.

54:03.702 --> 54:06.496
Mister, could you hand me
that mustard over there?

54:08.707 --> 54:10.709
Thank you.

54:15.380 --> 54:18.007
Okay, Karl.
The reason that l...

54:18.008 --> 54:20.302
brought you here is...

54:20.385 --> 54:23.221
to talk about something
that's on my mind.

54:23.222 --> 54:26.517
I'm just going to put it
right out on the table.

54:27.809 --> 54:29.728
Where do I start?

54:32.022 --> 54:35.734
Linda and Frank are
very important to me.

54:35.817 --> 54:37.903
They're like family.

54:38.028 --> 54:41.322
My own family was never like a family.

54:41.323 --> 54:45.576
They're horrible people.
As a matter of fact...

54:45.577 --> 54:50.332
for years I prayed every night
that my father would die...

54:50.415 --> 54:53.209
and finally realized,
through a lot of therapy...

54:53.210 --> 54:57.756
I was wasting my energy
on hating him.

54:57.923 --> 55:01.593
So now I just don't care.

55:01.718 --> 55:05.264
But you see, you and I
are a lot alike...

55:05.430 --> 55:07.266
as strange as that may seem.

55:07.432 --> 55:12.604
I don't mean physically
or even mentally, really...

55:12.729 --> 55:14.897
but emotionally.

55:14.898 --> 55:19.611
Actually, the hand
we've been dealt in life...

55:21.029 --> 55:25.700
We're different. People see us
as being different, anyway.

55:25.701 --> 55:29.037
You're...
You've got...

55:29.121 --> 55:32.415
your affliction or whatever and l...

55:32.416 --> 55:34.918
Well, mine's not as easy to see.

55:36.503 --> 55:38.630
I'm just going to say it.

55:38.714 --> 55:40.632
I'm gay.

55:41.717 --> 55:44.803
Does that surprise you?

55:44.928 --> 55:46.805
That I'm gay?

55:49.016 --> 55:53.312
- You know what "gay" is, don't you?
- I don't reckon.

55:57.024 --> 55:58.901
Homosexual.

55:59.026 --> 56:02.112
I like men. Sexually.

56:04.823 --> 56:06.825
Not "funny," ha-ha.
"Funny," queer.

56:09.328 --> 56:12.372
That's an offensive way
to put it.

56:12.497 --> 56:14.499
You shouldn't say that.

56:14.625 --> 56:17.503
You were taught that,
weren't you?

56:17.628 --> 56:20.379
I've heard it said that away,
yes, sir.

56:20.380 --> 56:25.302
Anyway, it's hard to live gay...
That's the right way to say it...

56:25.385 --> 56:27.304
In a small town like this.

56:27.387 --> 56:31.058
I've wanted to leave many times, but...

56:31.225 --> 56:33.310
because I love...

56:33.393 --> 56:37.230
Linda, Frank and...

56:37.231 --> 56:40.025
a certain other person...

56:40.067 --> 56:42.819
They've kept me here.
Anyway, I'm rambling.

56:44.321 --> 56:47.407
If you're going to live
in the Wheatley garage...

56:47.533 --> 56:50.035
you need to know it's
not going to be easy.

56:50.077 --> 56:52.704
Doyle is a monster.

56:52.829 --> 56:58.210
Not just a closed-minded redneck,
but a monster, a dangerous person.

56:58.335 --> 57:04.091
I've told Linda that one day that man
is going to hurt her and that boy...

57:04.216 --> 57:06.510
maybe even kill them.

57:06.593 --> 57:10.221
I see it in his eyes.
I'm very in tune, even psychic.

57:10.222 --> 57:12.766
But Doyle is going to
make your life hell.

57:18.605 --> 57:21.733
There's one more thing.

57:21.775 --> 57:26.238
It's none of my business why you were
in the state hospital.

57:26.280 --> 57:29.699
Everybody has something
in their past.

57:29.700 --> 57:31.826
Maybe...

57:31.827 --> 57:34.413
you tried suicide.

57:34.538 --> 57:38.208
Maybe you did something terrible.

57:38.333 --> 57:41.420
But what I see before me...

57:41.503 --> 57:44.297
is a gentle...

57:44.298 --> 57:47.426
simple man.

57:47.509 --> 57:51.513
All I want you to promise me...

57:52.598 --> 57:55.309
is that you are capable of being
around Frank and Linda.

57:55.434 --> 57:57.936
You know. You would never...

57:58.020 --> 58:01.815
hurt either of them
for any reason, would you?

58:03.525 --> 58:05.527
I would never hurt them.

58:07.029 --> 58:12.117
That's what I thought. I'm sorry
if I've offended you in any way.

58:13.202 --> 58:16.371
You seem like a thinker, you know.

58:16.538 --> 58:20.625
You seem to always be deep in thought.

58:20.626 --> 58:23.128
What are you thinking right now?

58:29.218 --> 58:33.514
I was thinking I might wanna take some
of these potatoes home with me.

58:35.516 --> 58:37.726
How about before that?

58:45.025 --> 58:47.236
Let me think.

58:49.238 --> 58:51.323
Before that, I was thinking...

58:51.406 --> 58:54.535
I could use me six or eight cans
of that potted meat...

58:54.576 --> 58:56.912
if you got any extra.

59:07.214 --> 59:09.383
Frankie, get some of this salad.

59:11.134 --> 59:13.220
Hold your plate up for me.

59:14.847 --> 59:19.058
I'm just gonna reach.
How come Karl won't eat in here with us?

59:19.059 --> 59:22.396
I don't know.
He said he'd eat out there.

59:22.563 --> 59:25.232
I wouldn't let it get to you.
Put some dressing on there.

59:25.357 --> 59:28.652
- Yes.
- I just feel sorry for the poor thing.

59:30.737 --> 59:34.950
Who the hell could eat with him making
all that racket in his throat?

59:35.033 --> 59:37.326
He does make some funny noises.

59:37.327 --> 59:39.328
I like the way he talks.

59:39.329 --> 59:43.249
Sounds like a race car motor idling.
Makes me not be nervous.

59:43.250 --> 59:45.335
I'm glad of it.

59:45.460 --> 59:48.630
What have you got to be nervous about?
You're a kid.

59:48.755 --> 59:51.925
You got no bills to pay,
no business to run.

59:52.050 --> 59:56.763
You don't even have to have a job.
You got no old lady on your ass at all.

59:56.847 --> 01:00:00.058
I don't know.
I just stay nervous.

01:00:01.935 --> 01:00:03.937
Could I have some of that ham?

01:00:04.062 --> 01:00:05.939
Yeah. I'm sorry.

01:00:08.942 --> 01:00:10.944
Thank you.

01:00:29.755 --> 01:00:33.634
- You know what, by God?
- What?

01:00:33.759 --> 01:00:35.636
I know what I ought to do tonight.

01:00:36.637 --> 01:00:38.597
Please, don't.

01:00:40.265 --> 01:00:42.518
I'm gonna call up Morris
and get the band together.

01:00:42.643 --> 01:00:45.020
We're gonna party our asses off.

01:00:46.688 --> 01:00:49.358
I'd love to show them Karl.
They'd get a kick out of him.

01:00:49.399 --> 01:00:51.860
Not tonight.
I'm not up for it.

01:00:51.944 --> 01:00:55.154
They always stay till morning.
I'll just give out.

01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:57.698
You don't gotta do nothing.
Just put chips in a bowl...

01:00:57.699 --> 01:01:00.536
and run ice out to us
when we get low.

01:01:00.661 --> 01:01:04.956
Last time, you got mad and run Morris
and them off and told them to stay away.

01:01:04.957 --> 01:01:09.336
That ain't none of your business.
Besides, that's the way friends are.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.883
Fuck. I'm calling them up.

01:01:19.137 --> 01:01:21.723
Linda, go into the garage
and get my guitar.

01:01:21.849 --> 01:01:24.101
It's out there with that looney toon.

01:01:24.226 --> 01:01:26.228
Now?

01:01:26.353 --> 01:01:28.730
Yeah, now.
I'm calling them up.

01:01:28.856 --> 01:01:33.025
Morris, what you doing, boy?

01:01:33.026 --> 01:01:35.654
Where's Randy and them?

01:01:35.696 --> 01:01:39.658
Yeah, now. Please.
Frankie, go help your mom.

01:01:39.741 --> 01:01:41.660
- When are we gonna eat?
- Hang on.

01:01:41.743 --> 01:01:43.662
Eat when you come back.
Get my guitar.

01:01:43.704 --> 01:01:45.789
Come on, sugar.

01:01:45.914 --> 01:01:47.915
I wanna get together.

01:01:47.916 --> 01:01:49.751
Yeah.

01:01:50.711 --> 01:01:52.212
Call him.

01:01:52.296 --> 01:01:55.424
One. Two. One, two, three, four.

01:02:36.757 --> 01:02:41.261
You gotta play through it. Wail on the
gig, but you gotta play through it.

01:02:41.345 --> 01:02:43.346
- No, you play through...
- You like that, Vaughan?

01:02:43.347 --> 01:02:46.892
Sure. It sounds like
a number one hit tune.

01:02:47.976 --> 01:02:50.145
Karl, did you like that?

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.983
- I reckon.
- I wish you'd all lay off for tonight!

01:02:55.108 --> 01:02:58.362
- I can't think with that racket!
- Hey!

01:02:58.445 --> 01:03:01.656
- It's nighttime.
- Hey!

01:03:01.657 --> 01:03:04.660
- I'm calling the police!
- I told you already!

01:03:04.701 --> 01:03:06.703
The law's on my side!

01:03:07.955 --> 01:03:11.792
I play cards with J.D. Shelnut,
chief of police!

01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:15.128
So kiss my ass, you old bastard!

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:21.134
You and Frank clean this mess up.
Put the tarp over these instruments.

01:03:21.218 --> 01:03:24.637
Me and the boys are going to
the county line. We're out of liquor.

01:03:24.638 --> 01:03:27.723
Karl, come with us.
Vaughan, come on.

01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:31.144
It's late.
I have to work tomorrow.

01:03:31.228 --> 01:03:34.063
Don't be a pussy.
We all gotta work tomorrow.

01:03:34.064 --> 01:03:35.858
- Come on.
- He don't want to.

01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:39.862
Don't go if you don't want to.
You'll wreck, Doyle. You're drunk.

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:44.533
I ain't gonna wreck.
I'll be good. I promise.

01:03:44.658 --> 01:03:46.660
I love you, sweetie.

01:03:47.619 --> 01:03:49.705
Come on, Karl. Go with us.

01:03:49.788 --> 01:03:53.417
Just trying to make these two
feel like they're part of it.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.209
Come on, Vaughan.
This'll be fun.

01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:58.005
Karl, let's go.
Come on.

01:04:04.511 --> 01:04:09.766
- You gotta lay out on that tambourine.
- I ain't did nothing wrong.

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:22.529
Hey! Ain't anybody gonna come get me?

01:04:23.739 --> 01:04:26.699
I don't understand
what you are talking about.

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:31.205
- Exactly the point, my young friend.
- I don't get it.

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:33.916
I rest my case.

01:04:33.999 --> 01:04:37.002
Morris is real smart
with philosophies and things.

01:04:37.127 --> 01:04:40.339
That's why him and me is the
songwriting team of our group.

01:04:40.464 --> 01:04:44.967
I come up with the good tunes,
or melodies, as we call them...

01:04:44.968 --> 01:04:46.928
Morris is the lyrics.

01:04:46.929 --> 01:04:49.765
Not unlike Gary Brooker
of Procol Harum.

01:04:49.848 --> 01:04:53.310
We don't ever played songs
y'all wrote. I ain't heard one of them.

01:04:53.352 --> 01:04:54.645
Y'all just talk.

01:04:54.811 --> 01:04:58.315
We don't play any songs
with words at all.

01:04:58.398 --> 01:05:03.153
We ain't got no fucking microphone!
We ain't got no speakers!

01:05:03.195 --> 01:05:05.447
We wrote one last night
outside the mini-mart.

01:05:05.531 --> 01:05:09.868
Morris called it, "Stuart Drives
a Comfortable Car."

01:05:09.952 --> 01:05:15.332
Then, like in country songs,
in parenthesis it says...

01:05:15.457 --> 01:05:18.544
"There's usually someone in the trunk."

01:05:18.627 --> 01:05:21.672
And I came up with a tune,
just humming.

01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:25.050
You don't wanna question
a genius, Vaughan.

01:05:25.133 --> 01:05:27.845
Morris here's a modern-day poet.

01:05:27.886 --> 01:05:30.013
Kind of like in the olden times.

01:05:30.138 --> 01:05:35.726
Yeah, I got a new tune. This
composition's entitled, "The Thrill."

01:05:35.727 --> 01:05:37.563
Goes something like this:

01:05:37.646 --> 01:05:42.400
I stand on the hill,
not for a thrill...

01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:45.529
but for a breath of a fresh kill.

01:05:45.654 --> 01:05:48.949
Never mind the man who contemplates...

01:05:49.032 --> 01:05:51.869
doing away with license plates.

01:05:51.952 --> 01:05:54.705
He stands alone anyhow...

01:05:54.746 --> 01:05:57.999
baking the cookies of discontent...

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.086
by the heat of the laundromat vent.

01:06:01.170 --> 01:06:03.922
Leaving his soul.

01:06:04.006 --> 01:06:07.843
Then, like in poetry,
I go dot, dot, dot.

01:06:07.968 --> 01:06:11.138
You know, kind of off-center,
then I drop down...

01:06:11.263 --> 01:06:13.931
and then I go: Leaving his soul...

01:06:13.932 --> 01:06:18.353
parting the waters
of the medulla oblongata...

01:06:18.437 --> 01:06:19.855
of...

01:06:21.607 --> 01:06:23.858
mankind.

01:06:23.859 --> 01:06:26.319
Damn good song, wasn't it?
You like that song?

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.238
All right.

01:06:29.239 --> 01:06:31.241
I don't think that's right.

01:06:31.283 --> 01:06:33.994
I believe the "dot, dot, dot"
come between...

01:06:34.161 --> 01:06:36.246
"medulla" and "oblongata."

01:06:40.417 --> 01:06:42.168
Well, it did.

01:06:42.169 --> 01:06:44.462
The dots are where I say they are.

01:06:44.463 --> 01:06:47.841
Melody and tune.
That's your trade, Terence.

01:06:47.966 --> 01:06:50.093
You're a tunesmith.

01:06:50.219 --> 01:06:52.346
I don't understand the words.

01:06:52.429 --> 01:06:55.640
Y'all don't shut up,
I'm gonna go out of my mind.

01:06:55.641 --> 01:07:00.312
Besides, Karl's liable to bust his
spring. He's already off balance.

01:07:00.395 --> 01:07:03.482
That wasn't the way you made
it up before. That's all I know.

01:07:03.565 --> 01:07:08.445
We don't need no fancy words.
We need to practice, to rehearse.

01:07:08.529 --> 01:07:11.865
I'll tell you what we need.
We need some paying gigs.

01:07:11.949 --> 01:07:16.537
We don't need this messing around.
That's ridiculous.

01:07:16.662 --> 01:07:18.205
Amen, Johnson.

01:07:19.706 --> 01:07:23.460
We don't got no goddamn band!

01:07:23.544 --> 01:07:26.588
We don't need to fucking practice!

01:07:26.713 --> 01:07:30.968
We don't need a shit-ass manager
neither!

01:07:31.051 --> 01:07:35.055
You motherfuckers!
You're all just a bunch of losers!

01:07:35.138 --> 01:07:37.641
I'm the only sane son-of-a-bitch here!

01:07:37.724 --> 01:07:39.726
Get the fuck out of my house!

01:07:39.852 --> 01:07:42.145
It's not your house.
It's Linda's.

01:07:42.229 --> 01:07:44.857
I'll whip the dog shit out of you.

01:07:44.898 --> 01:07:48.110
I will fucking kill you
if you talk to me again!

01:07:48.235 --> 01:07:52.614
All of you get the fuck out
before I get too mad to turn back!

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.951
What about our instruments?

01:07:57.035 --> 01:07:58.661
Come here, you little prick!

01:07:58.662 --> 01:08:02.124
Come here, you little fucking prick!

01:08:02.916 --> 01:08:05.919
Get out!
All y'all!

01:08:06.003 --> 01:08:08.004
Get the fuck out!

01:08:08.005 --> 01:08:10.048
Come on, you motherfuckers!

01:08:12.551 --> 01:08:14.970
Get the fuck out!

01:08:15.053 --> 01:08:17.389
Randy, you tuning son-of-a-bitch!

01:08:19.057 --> 01:08:21.059
Go fucking practice!

01:08:24.145 --> 01:08:27.149
Come on, Morris. You fucking genius.
Get the fuck up...

01:08:27.191 --> 01:08:30.068
and get the fuck out of here,
goddammit!

01:08:32.237 --> 01:08:34.281
This ain't right, Doyle.

01:08:35.823 --> 01:08:38.117
- There's something wrong with you.
- Get out!

01:08:38.118 --> 01:08:40.453
Nobody wants to take this shit.

01:08:50.506 --> 01:08:53.466
Dots look good on paper.
You don't sing them anyway.

01:08:53.509 --> 01:08:58.721
- You're just showing your true colors.
- Stay out of my face, you buzzard!

01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:09.608
Hey! I said get out of my house!

01:09:09.649 --> 01:09:12.486
That goes for cocksuckers and retards!

01:09:12.653 --> 01:09:14.363
Get up off your asses and go!

01:09:14.404 --> 01:09:17.198
This is not your house.
This is my house.

01:09:17.198 --> 01:09:19.368
I'll say who stays and goes.

01:09:19.451 --> 01:09:23.412
You got a house.
Why don't you go home to it?

01:09:23.538 --> 01:09:26.666
You know better to talk like
that when I'm hurting.

01:09:26.667 --> 01:09:28.709
Don't make me knock the piss out of you.

01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:31.295
Don't you touch her.

01:09:31.296 --> 01:09:33.840
That's funny, Vaughan.

01:09:33.841 --> 01:09:37.553
Linda, go to bed.
And take little snot-nose here with you.

01:09:37.594 --> 01:09:39.845
You're not staying here tonight.

01:09:39.846 --> 01:09:43.890
Get sober before you come back.
I'm tired of my child seeing this.

01:09:43.892 --> 01:09:49.064
Get your ass straight or I'll lock
your ass out of my life for good.

01:09:49.147 --> 01:09:53.234
If you even think about leaving me,
I told you...

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:55.571
I'm gonna kill you deader than
a doornail.

01:09:55.612 --> 01:09:58.492
- That might be better than this.
- I'm a witness to you threatening her.

01:09:58.615 --> 01:10:00.659
You get the fuck out now!

01:10:00.826 --> 01:10:02.411
Leave!

01:10:03.453 --> 01:10:06.874
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Leave!

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:16.008
- Don't do that!
- I'm calling the police!

01:10:16.133 --> 01:10:20.052
- Goddamn you, little prick!
- Don't touch my mama!

01:10:20.053 --> 01:10:23.097
Don't touch her!
Go home!

01:10:23.098 --> 01:10:25.809
- Get away from here!
- Jesus!

01:10:25.934 --> 01:10:28.395
Hey! Goddamn you!

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.439
Get away from us!

01:10:35.068 --> 01:10:36.945
Get away from us!

01:10:38.197 --> 01:10:41.325
All right.
Okay.

01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:43.827
I'm gonna leave now.
Fuck me.

01:10:48.457 --> 01:10:50.959
I'm gonna go home and sober up.

01:10:52.961 --> 01:10:55.756
Go on, then.

01:10:55.839 --> 01:10:58.926
Everything's bothering me.
I'm hurting, Linda.

01:11:01.094 --> 01:11:03.055
- I love you.
- Well, I hate you!

01:11:03.222 --> 01:11:07.184
I hate you, you little prick!
No, I don't.

01:11:07.226 --> 01:11:10.229
I love your mama.

01:11:10.354 --> 01:11:12.314
I just...

01:11:12.397 --> 01:11:15.107
I can't explain what goes on.

01:11:15.108 --> 01:11:18.195
You bunch of freaks.
I hope you have fun.

01:11:20.531 --> 01:11:22.449
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:11:23.158 --> 01:11:25.160
I'm sorry, honey.

01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:29.790
I said I'm sorry, Linda.

01:11:34.169 --> 01:11:37.005
All right.
You can kiss my ass.

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:39.591
And if you ever hit me again,
you little bastard...

01:11:39.716 --> 01:11:43.637
I'll make you sorry
your daddy ever squirted your ass out.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.681
You hear me?

01:12:05.117 --> 01:12:08.120
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

01:12:08.245 --> 01:12:11.164
Let's just try
and forget about tonight.

01:12:12.749 --> 01:12:15.627
We don't need to think about
bad thoughts, do we?

01:12:15.711 --> 01:12:17.671
No, honey. We don't.

01:12:18.964 --> 01:12:21.341
I'll make some coffee
and start cleaning up.

01:12:21.466 --> 01:12:24.427
Karl, you want some coffee, hon?

01:12:24.428 --> 01:12:27.764
Coffee kindly make me nervous
when I drink it.

01:12:44.656 --> 01:12:47.659
You scared me.

01:12:47.743 --> 01:12:52.247
- I didn't aim to.
- You wanna sit down? You need something?

01:12:52.331 --> 01:12:54.249
No, ma'am.

01:13:10.098 --> 01:13:15.062
There was these two fellers standing
on a bridge going to the bathroom.

01:13:17.314 --> 01:13:21.526
One feller says that the water is cold.

01:13:21.527 --> 01:13:23.904
The other says that the water is deep.

01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:30.536
I believe one feller comes from
Arkansas.

01:13:31.537 --> 01:13:33.539
Get it?

01:13:35.165 --> 01:13:37.209
I'll be dog.

01:13:49.596 --> 01:13:53.141
Reckon you can make some biscuits?

01:13:53.183 --> 01:13:55.894
You mean right now?

01:13:56.061 --> 01:13:59.606
Whenever you take a notion to.
I don't mean to put you out none.

01:14:00.858 --> 01:14:03.569
It is nearly breakfast time anyway.

01:14:03.652 --> 01:14:07.239
I can't go to sleep.
I have to be at work in three hours.

01:14:07.364 --> 01:14:09.700
You know how it is if you only sleep
an hour or two.

01:14:09.825 --> 01:14:12.744
You feel worse than if you hadn't
slept at all.

01:14:12.828 --> 01:14:14.746
Yes, ma'am. I do.

01:14:17.082 --> 01:14:20.669
Sit down.
I'll make you some biscuits and gravy.

01:14:20.752 --> 01:14:24.464
- Mustard's good on them to me.
- Okay.

01:14:24.506 --> 01:14:28.343
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:34.641
I was thinking...
There's this girl that works with me.

01:14:34.766 --> 01:14:37.643
She's real heavy,
but she's cute in the face.

01:14:37.644 --> 01:14:41.148
Well, you know, she's slow.

01:14:42.733 --> 01:14:47.445
She's a little bit...
She's not retarded.

01:14:47.446 --> 01:14:50.741
It don't matter.
I thought you might like to meet her.

01:14:50.824 --> 01:14:53.994
Vaughan wants to have a supper at his
house. We could invite her.

01:14:54.161 --> 01:14:56.246
Would you like that?

01:14:57.289 --> 01:15:00.959
I reckon I wouldn't mind
having a little supper.

01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:04.463
Vaughan's friend will be there too.
He works at the funeral home.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.134
You know, Frank really likes you a lot.

01:15:09.218 --> 01:15:11.887
He says you make him feel calm.

01:15:11.970 --> 01:15:15.349
I like Frank.
He's a good boy.

01:15:15.432 --> 01:15:18.060
Me and him made friends.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:27.443
It ain't right for me to keep
from telling you...

01:15:27.444 --> 01:15:30.030
how come me to be in a state hospital.

01:15:31.657 --> 01:15:34.451
That's okay.
It's not really my business.

01:15:36.036 --> 01:15:38.622
Have wondered, though.

01:15:38.705 --> 01:15:42.543
Why was it?
Was it like a nervous breakdown?

01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:53.344
I killed my mother
and an old boy named Jesse Dixon.

01:15:53.345 --> 01:15:55.848
I thought they's doing wrong.

01:15:56.723 --> 01:15:59.351
I was about your boy's age.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.603
They told me I'm well from it now.

01:16:01.728 --> 01:16:03.647
Was that you?

01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:06.233
I remember that.
I was only three or four...

01:16:06.358 --> 01:16:08.652
but I always heard about it
growing up.

01:16:08.694 --> 01:16:11.363
They say you're well?

01:16:11.405 --> 01:16:13.282
Yes, ma'am.

01:16:19.955 --> 01:16:22.165
I like your garage.

01:16:26.295 --> 01:16:29.755
I never would hurt you or that boy.

01:16:29.756 --> 01:16:33.844
I'd lay my hand on the Bible
and say the same thing.

01:16:33.927 --> 01:16:36.305
I know you wouldn't, hon.

01:16:43.645 --> 01:16:46.106
Well, I'll make you some biscuits.

01:17:00.621 --> 01:17:02.331
How about you, Jerry?

01:17:02.456 --> 01:17:04.791
- How are you, Bill?
- Doing pretty good.

01:17:04.917 --> 01:17:08.461
Got a sick tiller.
What's got you down this way?

01:17:08.462 --> 01:17:11.173
I thought I'd check up on Karl.
See how things are working out.

01:17:11.215 --> 01:17:14.676
He's pretty quiet, except for them
rackets and breathing things he does.

01:17:14.801 --> 01:17:17.095
He ain't threatening me
with a killing or nothing.

01:17:17.221 --> 01:17:19.472
You couldn't have been more right
about him fixing things.

01:17:19.473 --> 01:17:22.184
He's a regular Eli Whitney
on a lawn mower.

01:17:22.267 --> 01:17:26.897
And loves french fries. He can eat
four larges and won't even belch.

01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.899
I'm proud to have him.

01:17:28.982 --> 01:17:31.943
- Him staying working out?
- He's gone to staying with...

01:17:31.944 --> 01:17:34.445
that Wheatley boy and his mama
in their garage.

01:17:34.446 --> 01:17:37.366
That little boy's adopted
him like a mascot.

01:17:37.449 --> 01:17:39.700
He got a key here
to come and go as he pleases.

01:17:39.701 --> 01:17:41.662
He's working out real good.

01:17:41.703 --> 01:17:43.329
- Can I see him?
- Sure.

01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:45.707
Scooter, take Jerry in
to talk to Karl.

01:17:45.874 --> 01:17:47.709
All right.

01:17:53.006 --> 01:17:56.134
Sure you'll be okay
staying with that woman and her boy?

01:17:56.176 --> 01:17:58.136
Yes, sir.

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:01.014
Do they know about you?

01:18:01.139 --> 01:18:03.058
My history?

01:18:03.141 --> 01:18:04.852
Yeah.

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.563
I told them about it.

01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:12.067
They know I'm well.

01:18:13.151 --> 01:18:15.571
That Miss Wheatley
made me some biscuits.

01:18:16.572 --> 01:18:18.906
I'll be.

01:18:18.907 --> 01:18:22.327
That boy, he's my friend.

01:18:22.452 --> 01:18:25.581
He likes the way I talk,
and I like the way he talks.

01:18:27.499 --> 01:18:29.418
I knew you were gonna be all right.

01:18:29.501 --> 01:18:32.129
I just wanna check on you.

01:18:32.171 --> 01:18:36.174
I'm gonna tell Bill good-bye
and head on back.

01:18:36.175 --> 01:18:38.135
All right, then.

01:18:42.973 --> 01:18:45.642
Karl, see if you can
figure out what's wrong with this thing.

01:18:45.726 --> 01:18:48.896
It won't crank up. Everything seems
to be put together right.

01:18:49.062 --> 01:18:51.565
- Bill, I'll see you.
- Okay. Stop back by.

01:18:51.648 --> 01:18:54.735
Don't worry about your boy.
He's doing good.

01:18:55.652 --> 01:18:58.821
It ain't got no gas in it.

01:18:58.822 --> 01:19:02.618
You see there, Scooter.
Thinks of the simplest things first.

01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:07.706
- Does everybody like the food?
- Yeah.

01:19:07.831 --> 01:19:11.168
Good. I haven't decided yet
if I'm a good cook.

01:19:13.462 --> 01:19:15.255
Karl, you know what?

01:19:15.339 --> 01:19:19.927
Melinda was voted employee of the month
at the Dollar Store last February.

01:19:20.052 --> 01:19:22.804
Isn't that something?

01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:24.890
Yes, ma'am. I reckon.

01:19:25.057 --> 01:19:28.769
When you like pricing items
as much as I do...

01:19:28.852 --> 01:19:32.439
it's just bound to happen
sooner or later, I guess.

01:19:34.483 --> 01:19:39.446
Maybe you and Melinda
might like to take a walk tonight.

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:42.449
- It's such a nice evening.
- Vaughan, don't get pushy.

01:19:42.533 --> 01:19:44.701
I'm sorry.

01:19:45.869 --> 01:19:49.164
I kind of like walking
from time to time.

01:19:49.206 --> 01:19:52.041
I stay on my feet all the time at work.

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:55.545
I just can't find shoes
that's comfortable.

01:19:55.546 --> 01:19:59.716
Hospital shoes might be the answer.
Nurse's shoes.

01:19:59.842 --> 01:20:02.468
Or the kind old ladies wear
who work in school cafeterias.

01:20:02.469 --> 01:20:05.222
Same difference.

01:20:05.347 --> 01:20:08.058
I get real mean when my feet hurt.

01:20:08.141 --> 01:20:11.562
It's the only time
I don't like checking out customers.

01:20:11.645 --> 01:20:14.147
When my feet hurt.

01:20:14.231 --> 01:20:16.650
You and Karl aren't talking much.

01:20:16.733 --> 01:20:19.570
You boys must really like that food.

01:20:19.653 --> 01:20:22.698
Well, I ain't got nothing to say
about shoes.

01:20:22.781 --> 01:20:25.157
Listen, everybody.

01:20:25.158 --> 01:20:28.036
This might sound corny, but...

01:20:29.454 --> 01:20:32.374
I've had some wine
and that tends to make me emotional...

01:20:32.499 --> 01:20:34.501
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

01:20:34.626 --> 01:20:37.254
It came over me in a rush.

01:20:37.337 --> 01:20:39.839
I just want you all to know...

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:45.012
that I care about
each and every person at this table.

01:20:45.137 --> 01:20:47.264
Thank you.
That's really sweet of you.

01:20:47.347 --> 01:20:49.640
We care about you too.
Don't we, y'all?

01:20:49.641 --> 01:20:51.101
Yeah.

01:20:51.226 --> 01:20:56.064
Also, please don't tell anyone
at the store...

01:20:56.148 --> 01:20:58.275
that Albert was here tonight.

01:21:03.071 --> 01:21:04.822
Why?

01:21:04.823 --> 01:21:07.326
You know how this town is.
People talk...

01:21:07.451 --> 01:21:10.829
and they spread cruel rumors.

01:21:10.954 --> 01:21:16.251
Unfortunately, there's certain parts
of my life I have to keep private.

01:21:16.335 --> 01:21:20.964
You mean about you and Albert
being together in that way?

01:21:21.173 --> 01:21:24.468
- Yes.
- I think everybody already knows.

01:21:24.635 --> 01:21:26.970
They're always talking about it.

01:21:27.095 --> 01:21:30.390
Maureen Ledbetter told
the most awful story...

01:21:30.432 --> 01:21:34.060
about why you ain't allowed
at the First Baptist Church no more.

01:21:34.061 --> 01:21:37.731
Karl, why don't you and Melinda
take a walk? It's nice out.

01:21:44.446 --> 01:21:46.657
All right, then.

01:21:55.999 --> 01:21:57.960
That sure was quick.

01:22:05.467 --> 01:22:07.344
You walk fast, don't you?

01:22:07.469 --> 01:22:09.346
I reckon.

01:22:11.139 --> 01:22:13.559
These are the worst shoes I own
for walking.

01:22:14.643 --> 01:22:17.396
How far'd you say you want to go?

01:22:17.563 --> 01:22:21.233
I don't reckon
I thought about it too much.

01:22:22.568 --> 01:22:23.235
I don't know.
She just ain't catching fire.

01:22:23.236 --> 01:22:26.196
I don't know.
She just ain't catching fire.

01:22:26.321 --> 01:22:28.615
Did you check them points?

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.160
No, I didn't.

01:22:32.286 --> 01:22:34.454
That's probably it.

01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:38.709
- Yes, ma'am?
- Is Karl here?

01:22:38.792 --> 01:22:40.919
Yes. Just a minute.

01:22:44.173 --> 01:22:46.674
Karl. There's somebody out here
to see you.

01:22:46.675 --> 01:22:49.678
Some gal holding a nice bouquet.

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:54.141
Come on out. She wants to talk to you.
Don't just sit there.

01:23:07.946 --> 01:23:11.658
Hi. I'm on my lunch break.

01:23:11.742 --> 01:23:13.660
These are on sale
'cause they're not fresh.

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:19.957
Two ninety-nine a bunch, plus
my ten percent employee discount.

01:23:19.958 --> 01:23:24.505
Since I didn't bring nothing for you
on our date last night...

01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:27.007
I thought you might like to have them.

01:23:35.057 --> 01:23:36.934
Thank you.

01:23:37.059 --> 01:23:40.853
Scooter, let's go over to the Frosty
Cream and pick up something for lunch.

01:23:40.854 --> 01:23:42.731
I can go.
You don't have to.

01:23:42.773 --> 01:23:45.651
- You don't never go.
- Goddammit, Scooter. Let's go.

01:23:46.777 --> 01:23:48.654
Pardon my language, ma'am.

01:24:04.628 --> 01:24:07.673
Well, I just thought I'd bring them.

01:24:08.799 --> 01:24:11.050
I liked walking with you.

01:24:11.051 --> 01:24:14.346
I got a blister the size of a quarter
on one heel.

01:24:16.682 --> 01:24:20.352
Well, I'll see you sometime, I guess.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.861
Blisters sure can hurt.

01:24:31.113 --> 01:24:32.531
Yeah.

01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:38.912
Flowers is pretty.

01:24:39.037 --> 01:24:41.373
I've always thought that.

01:24:44.168 --> 01:24:46.170
Me too.

01:25:36.303 --> 01:25:39.597
Hey, Karl.
How'd you know I was in the garage?

01:25:39.598 --> 01:25:44.978
I seen that door cracked open a little.
I figured you was in there.

01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:47.481
- You off of work?
- Yes, sir.

01:25:47.648 --> 01:25:50.359
Where'd you get them flowers?

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.861
That gal that made employee of the month
at the Dollar Store.

01:25:53.862 --> 01:25:56.823
She gave them to me
for walking with her.

01:25:58.367 --> 01:26:00.661
I was going over to the secret place.

01:26:00.869 --> 01:26:04.039
I borrowed one of your books.
You ain't mad, are you?

01:26:04.164 --> 01:26:07.041
No, sir. You can look at every one
of my books you want to.

01:26:07.042 --> 01:26:10.461
Thank you.
It's name's "A Christmas Carol."

01:26:10.462 --> 01:26:13.465
That's that one on Christmas
I was telling you about.

01:26:14.508 --> 01:26:16.426
You wanna go with me?

01:26:17.553 --> 01:26:19.471
All right, then.

01:26:19.555 --> 01:26:21.974
- Yeah. Come on.
- All right.

01:26:29.857 --> 01:26:32.067
Know why I want you
to play ball with me?

01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:33.569
No.

01:26:33.652 --> 01:26:36.989
'Cause it's fun.
Don't matter if you ain't no good.

01:26:37.114 --> 01:26:39.824
It takes your mind
off of everything else.

01:26:39.825 --> 01:26:42.618
And when you're trying to score
a touchdown...

01:26:42.619 --> 01:26:44.663
that's all you're thinking about.

01:26:44.830 --> 01:26:48.041
I ain't no account,
but Daddy always said...

01:26:48.166 --> 01:26:52.129
he was proud of me when I threw the ball
and ran with it.

01:26:52.254 --> 01:26:56.757
Did you have any brothers and sisters
growing up to play with?

01:26:56.758 --> 01:26:59.761
I had one there for a little bit.

01:26:59.845 --> 01:27:01.263
But...

01:27:02.264 --> 01:27:05.267
it didn't get old enough
for me to play with it.

01:27:05.309 --> 01:27:07.852
Why not? It die?

01:27:07.853 --> 01:27:09.771
Yes, sir.

01:27:09.813 --> 01:27:11.273
Why?

01:27:12.357 --> 01:27:14.943
It got born a little too early.

01:27:15.068 --> 01:27:19.615
My mother and father
made it come out too early.

01:27:20.741 --> 01:27:23.076
So it died when it come out?

01:27:24.453 --> 01:27:28.457
My daddy come out to the shed
and got me...

01:27:28.498 --> 01:27:30.500
said, "Here. Take this
and throw it away."

01:27:30.501 --> 01:27:33.921
He handed me a towel
with something or another in it.

01:27:37.174 --> 01:27:38.967
I started for that barrel...

01:27:40.636 --> 01:27:44.223
and I opened up the towel
'cause there was a noise...

01:27:44.306 --> 01:27:46.391
and something moving around in it.

01:27:48.352 --> 01:27:52.356
That towel was all bloody-like
all around it there.

01:27:57.152 --> 01:28:01.365
It was a little old baby,
not no bigger than a squirrel.

01:28:02.199 --> 01:28:04.201
It was alive?

01:28:04.368 --> 01:28:06.954
Yes, sir.
Right then it was.

01:28:08.622 --> 01:28:10.207
A boy or girl?

01:28:11.542 --> 01:28:13.919
It was a little old boy.

01:28:15.879 --> 01:28:18.215
You threw it in the trash barrel?

01:28:19.174 --> 01:28:21.968
That didn't seem right to me.

01:28:21.969 --> 01:28:24.221
So I went into the shed
and got a shoe box...

01:28:24.346 --> 01:28:27.056
and emptied out the screwdrivers,
washers and nuts...

01:28:27.057 --> 01:28:29.059
and things out of it.

01:28:30.352 --> 01:28:33.563
I taken the little feller
and put him in the box...

01:28:33.564 --> 01:28:36.567
buried him in the corner of the yard.

01:28:36.650 --> 01:28:40.070
That seemed more proper to me,
I reckon.

01:28:40.904 --> 01:28:43.156
It was still alive when you buried it?

01:28:44.616 --> 01:28:47.327
I heard it crying a little
through that box.

01:28:52.541 --> 01:28:56.378
That don't seem right. It seems like
you would have took care of him...

01:28:56.461 --> 01:28:58.547
if he was your brother.

01:28:58.630 --> 01:29:00.757
I wasn't but six or eight.

01:29:00.841 --> 01:29:04.178
I reckon I didn't know
what to do.

01:29:04.261 --> 01:29:06.471
I didn't know how to care
for no baby.

01:29:07.639 --> 01:29:10.017
My mother and father didn't want him.

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.146
They learned me to do
what they told me to do.

01:29:15.772 --> 01:29:19.443
I figure it probably best we give him
right back to the good Lord...

01:29:19.568 --> 01:29:21.612
right off the bat anyhow.

01:29:22.821 --> 01:29:25.741
That makes me feel real sad.

01:29:26.783 --> 01:29:29.077
Couldn't you have done something?

01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:31.747
I would have.
I wish I'd had him.

01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:35.667
He'd still be right here, now.
Living.

01:29:36.668 --> 01:29:38.629
It makes me sad too.

01:29:39.963 --> 01:29:42.925
I wish there was something
I could have did about it.

01:29:45.969 --> 01:29:49.389
I don't think nothing bad
oughta happen to children.

01:29:50.474 --> 01:29:53.018
I think all those bad things
oughta be saved up...

01:29:53.143 --> 01:29:58.023
for the folks that done growed up,
that's the way I see it.

01:30:00.442 --> 01:30:03.528
I shouldn't have told you about that.

01:30:03.529 --> 01:30:07.032
Boy your age ought not
to hear such things.

01:30:07.115 --> 01:30:09.701
It just kind of come out.

01:30:09.826 --> 01:30:12.955
I didn't mean to say nothing
bad about you.

01:30:13.038 --> 01:30:17.042
You're good.
You don't mean no harm.

01:30:17.167 --> 01:30:21.547
You ever think about killing yourself
on purpose, like Daddy did?

01:30:24.341 --> 01:30:26.677
I studied about it some.

01:30:27.678 --> 01:30:29.847
Bible says you ought not to.

01:30:31.682 --> 01:30:35.060
Says you do that,
you go off to Hades.

01:30:35.143 --> 01:30:38.105
Some folks call it hell.
I call it Hades.

01:30:39.565 --> 01:30:43.151
Bible says the same thing
about killing others too.

01:30:53.036 --> 01:30:55.330
Yes, sir.
I reckon it does.

01:31:12.764 --> 01:31:16.268
Spend more time over here...

01:31:17.269 --> 01:31:19.146
Well, hell.
There's the boys.

01:31:19.271 --> 01:31:21.982
How you doing?
Glad you all came back.

01:31:23.358 --> 01:31:26.777
I was wanting to talk to y'all.
Come sit down.

01:31:26.778 --> 01:31:28.780
Come on. Sit down.

01:31:28.822 --> 01:31:33.827
I was just telling Linda...
We were thinking that things...

01:31:33.952 --> 01:31:37.748
would be a lot better if I spent
more time over here.

01:31:37.831 --> 01:31:42.668
And if we could...
Hell, I'll just start over.

01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:47.257
I took off work early today, and your
mama did the same, so we could talk.

01:31:48.342 --> 01:31:51.761
Really what I came over here to do
was apologize...

01:31:51.762 --> 01:31:53.971
Which ain't easy for me...

01:31:53.972 --> 01:31:56.266
About how I acted the other night.

01:31:57.518 --> 01:31:59.269
I admit it.
I was drunk.

01:32:00.521 --> 01:32:04.358
I got all worked up
and one thing led to another.

01:32:05.442 --> 01:32:09.863
I care about you all, though.
I do.

01:32:09.947 --> 01:32:13.659
I don't mean to be so damned...

01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:16.703
Well, asshole-ish,
I guess would be the word.

01:32:17.871 --> 01:32:20.958
Karl, I don't believe I hit you,
did l?

01:32:21.041 --> 01:32:24.168
So no apology necessary, I guess.

01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:26.546
But, Frankie, I'm sorry.

01:32:26.547 --> 01:32:29.049
I'm sorry I hit your mama.

01:32:30.175 --> 01:32:32.970
It's just that I'm jealous of her.

01:32:33.053 --> 01:32:35.848
I don't like her life
or how she lives it.

01:32:37.057 --> 01:32:39.059
I don't like homosexuals.

01:32:39.142 --> 01:32:43.730
And she goes out and buddies
up with one, so I gotta deal with that.

01:32:43.856 --> 01:32:46.858
I don't like wimpy-ass kids
or mental retards...

01:32:46.859 --> 01:32:49.278
and she got one of each
living with her.

01:32:50.946 --> 01:32:53.448
I'm just kidding about that.

01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:56.743
I mean, we all got to get along...

01:32:56.869 --> 01:32:59.371
no matter what our differences are.

01:33:00.664 --> 01:33:03.083
See, I work construction.

01:33:03.166 --> 01:33:05.043
I build things.

01:33:05.169 --> 01:33:08.255
You understand how important that is
to the world, Frankie?

01:33:09.882 --> 01:33:14.261
I don't know if you realize
the pressure a man like me's got on him.

01:33:15.679 --> 01:33:19.348
The upshot is, I'm gonna be spending
a lot more time here.

01:33:19.349 --> 01:33:22.352
We're gonna all get along
like a family should.

01:33:23.854 --> 01:33:27.274
I might even surprise you
and pop the question.

01:33:32.154 --> 01:33:34.072
Well.

01:33:34.156 --> 01:33:37.659
I'm gonna get on back over
to the job site...

01:33:37.743 --> 01:33:39.661
Iock up some stuff over there.

01:33:39.745 --> 01:33:45.667
I just wanted to stop by and give y'all
a little piece of happiness today.

01:33:45.751 --> 01:33:46.960
Bye-bye.

01:33:53.008 --> 01:33:55.677
You be a good boy now.
Hear me?

01:34:02.476 --> 01:34:06.146
Well, at least he's trying...

01:34:06.271 --> 01:34:08.774
but who knows for how long.

01:34:08.857 --> 01:34:12.778
He's lying, Mama.
He'll never do better.

01:34:12.861 --> 01:34:15.030
I know, honey.

01:34:16.657 --> 01:34:19.867
Just remember what I said.
We'll bide our time.

01:34:19.868 --> 01:34:24.038
You just steer clear of him
as much as you can.

01:34:24.039 --> 01:34:27.876
Doyle's had a hard life.
It's just about run him crazy.

01:34:28.961 --> 01:34:32.214
We had hard lives too, Mama.

01:34:34.716 --> 01:34:37.553
You're a hell of a boy, Frank.

01:34:39.179 --> 01:34:43.976
Someday, you're gonna get
all the good things you deserve.

01:34:44.059 --> 01:34:48.564
Karl's gonna get some more biscuits
tonight. What do you think about that?

01:34:49.857 --> 01:34:52.150
I could sure use some.

01:34:59.783 --> 01:35:02.452
Karl, come unload
a generator for me.

01:35:14.673 --> 01:35:17.467
Lift this thing down
and carry it to the back.

01:35:17.551 --> 01:35:20.469
- It's on the blink.
- You want us to help you lift that?

01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:23.056
No. That Karl's strong enough
to lift a bulldozer.

01:35:23.182 --> 01:35:25.767
He can fix anything too.

01:35:25.851 --> 01:35:28.979
He's mentally retarded, but he's a whiz
at small engines.

01:35:30.147 --> 01:35:33.275
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

01:35:33.358 --> 01:35:36.820
What I was telling you was,
he didn't just make the team...

01:35:36.945 --> 01:35:40.949
Coach says he's gonna
start him at end on defense.

01:35:41.074 --> 01:35:43.659
Guy's a chip off the old block,
ain't you, Steve?

01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:46.747
- I guess so.
- How's the rest of the team look?

01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:49.082
Pretty good.
We expect to do well.

01:35:49.166 --> 01:35:52.836
- Got a quarterback this year?
- Jeff Bailey's boy. You know him.

01:35:52.961 --> 01:35:55.963
- Got a good arm. A little slow.
- I watched him in junior high.

01:35:55.964 --> 01:35:58.674
He throws the ball pretty well.
He's taller now.

01:35:58.675 --> 01:36:00.510
You gonna start at the defensive end?

01:36:00.511 --> 01:36:02.513
Hup!

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.349
Come on, man!

01:36:12.022 --> 01:36:14.274
Good job, Karl.
We got a touchdown.

01:36:15.526 --> 01:36:17.444
That was a good lateral.

01:36:17.528 --> 01:36:19.530
That was just like the wishbone.

01:36:20.781 --> 01:36:24.535
Yes, sir.
I darned near made me a touchdown.

01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:26.453
Then I seen them boys
bearing down on me.

01:36:26.537 --> 01:36:30.165
Figured I better give it off
to you. I seen you following me.

01:36:30.207 --> 01:36:34.043
We liable to win
if we keep this up.

01:36:34.044 --> 01:36:37.172
For somebody like you,
you sure can run fast.

01:36:37.214 --> 01:36:40.717
- Come on. Let's kick off to them.
- All right, then.

01:36:45.848 --> 01:36:48.475
I know you could have
scored that touchdown by yourself...

01:36:48.559 --> 01:36:51.144
instead of throwing it over to me.

01:36:51.228 --> 01:36:54.981
Them boys was trying to pull me down
pretty hard.

01:36:54.982 --> 01:36:57.651
You're strong.
You just threw it to me...

01:36:57.776 --> 01:37:00.779
where I could score that touchdown
so I'd feel good.

01:37:00.863 --> 01:37:03.657
My daddy used to do
that kind of thing.

01:37:06.368 --> 01:37:09.663
It don't matter to me about us losing.
Does it to you?

01:37:09.746 --> 01:37:11.456
No, sir.

01:37:11.582 --> 01:37:13.584
It was fun anyhow.

01:37:13.667 --> 01:37:18.255
I wasn't thinking about nothing else,
just like you told me I'd do.

01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:20.756
Can we play every Saturday?

01:37:20.757 --> 01:37:22.758
If I ain't too stove up.

01:37:22.759 --> 01:37:25.679
I ain't like you.
I'm old and give out.

01:37:28.974 --> 01:37:31.977
I'm proud of you.

01:39:46.153 --> 01:39:49.448
I'd kick your head in
25 years ago.

01:39:49.573 --> 01:39:53.452
You're dead, I guess.
Where'd you go to?

01:39:56.163 --> 01:39:59.166
I know, Mother. That's kind of sad.
I was drunk when I did it.

01:40:12.763 --> 01:40:14.681
I'm your boy.

01:40:18.018 --> 01:40:20.020
I ain't got no boy.

01:40:23.357 --> 01:40:26.276
I'm your oldest boy,
name of Karl.

01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.278
I ain't got no boy.

01:40:31.365 --> 01:40:33.866
They turned me loose
from the nervous hospital.

01:40:33.867 --> 01:40:36.286
Said I was well.

01:40:45.045 --> 01:40:50.676
I got hired on to work for Mr. Bill Cox,
fixing lawn mowers and whatnot.

01:40:53.679 --> 01:40:57.349
That grass out there in the yard
growed up quite a bit.

01:40:57.474 --> 01:40:59.685
I figured I might cut it for you.

01:41:01.186 --> 01:41:06.149
I told you I ain't got no boy.
Get on out of here and let me be.

01:41:06.275 --> 01:41:09.069
You ain't no kin to me.

01:41:12.573 --> 01:41:14.950
I learned to read some.

01:41:18.453 --> 01:41:20.581
I read the Bible quite a bit.

01:41:26.962 --> 01:41:29.047
I can't understand all of it.

01:41:29.173 --> 01:41:32.758
But I reckon I understand
a good deal of it.

01:41:32.759 --> 01:41:36.847
Them stories you and Mama told me,
they ain't in there.

01:41:39.183 --> 01:41:42.269
You ought not done that to your boy.

01:41:43.979 --> 01:41:46.773
I studied on killing you.

01:41:47.649 --> 01:41:49.776
I studied about it quite a bit.

01:41:54.823 --> 01:41:57.284
But I reckon there's no need for it
if all you're gonna do...

01:41:57.326 --> 01:42:00.454
is sit there in that chair.

01:42:00.579 --> 01:42:03.581
You'll be dead soon enough.

01:42:03.582 --> 01:42:06.251
And the world'll be shut of you.

01:42:14.343 --> 01:42:17.346
You ought not kill my little brother.

01:42:20.474 --> 01:42:22.851
He ought of had
a chance to growed up.

01:42:25.521 --> 01:42:28.857
He would have had fun sometime.

01:43:02.683 --> 01:43:04.560
Little feller.

01:44:15.964 --> 01:44:20.760
What the goddamn hell
you doing up in the middle of the night?

01:44:20.761 --> 01:44:22.678
What you want, hon?

01:44:22.679 --> 01:44:24.681
I wanna be baptized.

01:44:24.765 --> 01:44:27.266
Get baptized then.
I don't give a shit!

01:44:27.267 --> 01:44:30.854
Call up a fucking preacher!
We can't baptize you.

01:44:30.979 --> 01:44:34.358
We'll go see Brother Epersom tomorrow
and get you baptized.

01:44:34.483 --> 01:44:37.986
It's Sunday.
You go on back to bed now.

01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:41.865
What are you doing
with that damn hammer?

01:44:46.036 --> 01:44:49.456
I don't rightly know.
I just woke up holding it.

01:44:58.549 --> 01:45:01.385
- What's he's doing with that hammer?
- I don't know.

01:45:24.283 --> 01:45:28.579
Upon his profession of faith
in our Lord Jesus Christ...

01:45:28.704 --> 01:45:31.289
in obedience under His command...

01:45:31.290 --> 01:45:33.584
and by the authority of this church...

01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:36.879
I indeed baptize this brother...

01:45:37.004 --> 01:45:39.798
in the name of the Father
and the Son...

01:45:39.882 --> 01:45:41.800
and the Holy Ghost.

01:45:45.095 --> 01:45:46.805
Amen.

01:45:46.889 --> 01:45:49.516
Marie, would you sing 137, please?

01:45:50.893 --> 01:45:53.979
Softly and tenderly

01:45:54.104 --> 01:45:56.982
Jesus is calling

01:45:58.108 --> 01:46:03.447
Calling for you and for me

01:46:09.286 --> 01:46:12.079
- How'd the baptizing go?
- Real good.

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:14.082
Yeah? Good.

01:46:15.083 --> 01:46:17.376
I'm kind of hungry.

01:46:17.377 --> 01:46:20.087
Isn't it about time to eat?

01:46:20.088 --> 01:46:24.134
You know what I got a crave for?
Some of that Chicken Champ.

01:46:24.301 --> 01:46:26.887
Why don't you run down and get some?
I'll buy.

01:46:26.970 --> 01:46:28.972
Would y'all like that?

01:46:29.097 --> 01:46:30.974
It sounds fine to me.

01:46:31.099 --> 01:46:33.977
I'd value me a chicken leg or two.

01:46:36.396 --> 01:46:40.484
- Get some of their cole slaw too.
- Okay. Y'all wanna go with me?

01:46:40.609 --> 01:46:42.985
They don't need to go with you.
There's a ball game coming on.

01:46:42.986 --> 01:46:47.281
- We'll sit here and do man things.
- I'll be back in a little bit.

01:46:47.282 --> 01:46:50.494
- All right. Get some extra gravy.
- Okay.

01:46:55.582 --> 01:46:58.085
Why don't y'all
sit your asses down here.

01:46:59.169 --> 01:47:01.088
Sit down.

01:47:13.684 --> 01:47:17.688
I just wanted to get your mama
out of the house so we could talk.

01:47:29.408 --> 01:47:31.410
Here's the deal, Frank.

01:47:34.288 --> 01:47:37.791
If I'm gonna throw my life away
to come live with y'all...

01:47:40.210 --> 01:47:43.005
we're gonna get some shit straight.

01:47:43.088 --> 01:47:47.300
Your mama and I don't have no problems
except for you.

01:47:47.301 --> 01:47:50.679
Fact is, we never have
a bad word between us.

01:47:50.804 --> 01:47:53.015
But since you do exist...

01:47:53.098 --> 01:47:55.892
and I'm gonna be
the head of the household...

01:47:55.893 --> 01:47:58.312
you're gonna learn
to live by my rules.

01:47:58.395 --> 01:48:02.399
The first rule is: You don't speak
unless you're spoken to.

01:48:02.441 --> 01:48:04.109
You got me?

01:48:05.194 --> 01:48:08.280
Now you stay
the hell out of my way.

01:48:08.405 --> 01:48:11.115
And do what a regular kid does.

01:48:11.116 --> 01:48:14.912
You're a weird little shit, Frank.
And I don't get you.

01:48:14.953 --> 01:48:19.583
So wake up
and face what they call reality.

01:48:20.459 --> 01:48:22.377
We're gonna be a family.

01:48:22.461 --> 01:48:24.880
My family.

01:48:24.963 --> 01:48:27.591
I'll be paying all the bills.

01:48:27.716 --> 01:48:30.469
So that means,
you're stuck with my ass...

01:48:30.594 --> 01:48:32.471
but I ain't your daddy.

01:48:33.597 --> 01:48:36.099
You just act like I am.

01:48:36.141 --> 01:48:38.142
The other thing I say is...

01:48:38.143 --> 01:48:40.145
your buddy Karl is going.

01:48:41.813 --> 01:48:44.399
We can't be no normal family
with him living in the garage...

01:48:44.483 --> 01:48:47.611
and coming in the bedroom
at 4:00 in the morning with hammers.

01:48:47.653 --> 01:48:50.113
Karl could stay if he wants to.
Mama said...

01:48:50.155 --> 01:48:52.115
What I tell you about your mama?

01:48:52.157 --> 01:48:55.576
Mister, don't you never
lay another hand on that boy.

01:48:55.577 --> 01:48:58.663
- You understand me?
- Let go of my hand, you retard.

01:48:58.664 --> 01:49:02.167
Get out there!
Get your shit and get out!

01:49:04.294 --> 01:49:07.297
That's a wake-up call, Frankie.

01:49:07.339 --> 01:49:09.508
You remember what I said
about reality!

01:49:10.592 --> 01:49:12.594
Get out, retard.

01:49:38.412 --> 01:49:42.082
Where you going?
Didn't you want some chicken and things?

01:49:42.207 --> 01:49:45.502
No, ma'am.
I'm going off somewheres.

01:49:45.586 --> 01:49:48.213
Well, okay.
I got you some.

01:49:48.297 --> 01:49:50.591
Frank... he went off somewheres too.

01:49:50.716 --> 01:49:53.093
So when you go in there,
he won't be indoors.

01:49:53.218 --> 01:49:55.095
Where did he go?
What's going on?

01:49:55.179 --> 01:49:58.014
He just wanted to go play, I reckon.

01:49:58.015 --> 01:50:00.017
You go in and eat
with that Doyle...

01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:02.685
and don't worry yourself none.

01:50:02.686 --> 01:50:04.688
All right, then.

01:50:04.813 --> 01:50:06.690
Well, I'll see you later.

01:50:06.815 --> 01:50:08.775
If you see Frank,
tell him to come home.

01:50:08.901 --> 01:50:10.944
I don't get to see him
except Sundays.

01:50:11.111 --> 01:50:13.780
He can go play tomorrow.

01:50:13.906 --> 01:50:15.782
- Ma'am?
- Yeah?

01:50:19.912 --> 01:50:22.915
You're a good mama to that boy.

01:50:22.956 --> 01:50:25.208
You care for him.

01:50:25.209 --> 01:50:28.086
You work hard to care for him.

01:50:28.212 --> 01:50:30.880
You light him up in his eyes.

01:50:30.881 --> 01:50:32.883
I've seen it.

01:50:34.092 --> 01:50:37.638
That boy wouldn't know what to do
without you.

01:50:37.804 --> 01:50:40.307
Thank you.
That's real good of you to say.

01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:43.100
I wouldn't know what to do
without him either.

01:50:43.101 --> 01:50:45.646
You been real good to me too.

01:50:45.812 --> 01:50:50.108
It ain't everybody that'd make biscuits
in the middle of the night.

01:50:50.150 --> 01:50:53.153
You and that boy's
given me a good feeling.

01:50:54.154 --> 01:50:56.907
We sure like having you.

01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:58.909
Thank you.

01:51:00.619 --> 01:51:03.664
I'm just now getting around
to telling you...

01:51:03.789 --> 01:51:08.292
But I fixed that washing machine so that
boy ain't gotta tote laundry no more.

01:51:08.293 --> 01:51:10.504
Thank you.

01:51:16.176 --> 01:51:18.178
You been real good to me.

01:51:35.487 --> 01:51:38.407
Hey, Karl.
How'd you know I'd come out here?

01:51:38.490 --> 01:51:41.910
I knowed you'd be out here.

01:51:41.994 --> 01:51:44.580
What you doing
digging with that stub?

01:51:44.705 --> 01:51:47.915
Just digging.
I ain't never gonna be happy now.

01:51:47.916 --> 01:51:51.378
Not with that son-of-a-bitch
moving in for good.

01:51:51.503 --> 01:51:54.381
I wish me and you and Mama
would just run away.

01:51:54.506 --> 01:51:56.717
She said...

01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:59.219
wherever we went, he'd find us.

01:51:59.303 --> 01:52:04.516
He's crazy. Sometimes I think it'd been
better off if I wasn't even born.

01:52:05.601 --> 01:52:07.978
I'm glad of it you was borned.

01:52:11.106 --> 01:52:14.776
I don't reckon I'm gonna be out there
in the garage no more.

01:52:14.902 --> 01:52:17.613
You have to.
You have to look out for me.

01:52:17.696 --> 01:52:20.448
You can't let that
son-of-a-bitch run you off.

01:52:20.449 --> 01:52:24.912
You just a boy.
You ought not use language like that.

01:52:26.079 --> 01:52:28.457
I don't mean to say nothing
bad about you...

01:52:28.582 --> 01:52:32.419
but why don't you stop Doyle
when he's being that way?

01:52:33.587 --> 01:52:36.089
You're older than him.
You're strong too.

01:52:37.466 --> 01:52:41.470
My daddy wouldn't let him
do that to me and Mama.

01:52:43.388 --> 01:52:46.390
That feller's a whole site
meaner than me.

01:52:46.391 --> 01:52:48.810
He'd just whup the tar out of me.

01:52:48.894 --> 01:52:51.396
Yeah. I guess so.

01:52:53.106 --> 01:52:55.150
I'm real tired, you know that?

01:52:56.652 --> 01:52:59.488
A boy my age shouldn't
be tired of things.

01:53:02.991 --> 01:53:04.910
I'm tired too.

01:53:07.913 --> 01:53:12.083
Just 'cause I ain't gonna be
around no more, maybe...

01:53:12.084 --> 01:53:14.586
that don't mean
I don't care for you.

01:53:14.670 --> 01:53:17.005
I care for you a good deal.

01:53:17.089 --> 01:53:20.092
I care for you more
than anything else there is.

01:53:20.175 --> 01:53:22.594
You and me made friends
right off the bat.

01:53:23.804 --> 01:53:26.306
I care for you too.
But you'll be around.

01:53:26.348 --> 01:53:28.808
Don't say that.

01:53:28.809 --> 01:53:32.104
It don't make no difference
where I was to be.

01:53:32.187 --> 01:53:36.984
We'll always be friends.
Can't nobody stop that.

01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:50.205
I aim for you to have these books.

01:53:50.289 --> 01:53:53.207
You don't wanna give away
all your books.

01:53:53.208 --> 01:53:55.294
I aim for you to have them.

01:54:04.094 --> 01:54:08.098
Maybe you can make more sense of them
than I can.

01:54:08.182 --> 01:54:13.312
I made you a bookmarker and put it
in that book on Christmas.

01:54:17.191 --> 01:54:19.193
Thanks.

01:54:20.944 --> 01:54:24.615
You know when you got a feeling
and you don't know why?

01:54:24.698 --> 01:54:27.201
Yes, sir.

01:54:27.284 --> 01:54:30.787
I got a feeling today.

01:54:30.913 --> 01:54:33.789
Reckon, what kind of a feeling?

01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:37.419
Like something different.
I don't know.

01:54:40.088 --> 01:54:41.965
You leaving, ain't you?

01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:55.479
Would you do something for me
if I was to ask you to?

01:54:55.604 --> 01:54:59.107
You know I would.
Whatever you want.

01:55:01.401 --> 01:55:03.487
When you leave outta here tonight...

01:55:03.612 --> 01:55:07.491
I don't want you going over there
and staying with that Doyle.

01:55:09.993 --> 01:55:14.790
He's got it out for you tonight.
I got me a feeling too.

01:55:14.915 --> 01:55:18.710
You ought not be over there
when he's all liquored up and mean.

01:55:18.794 --> 01:55:20.712
Your mama neither.

01:55:21.797 --> 01:55:26.217
When you get up here and leave, I want
you to go to that feller's house...

01:55:26.218 --> 01:55:28.720
Your mama's friend.

01:55:31.306 --> 01:55:34.518
I want you to give me your word on it.

01:55:34.601 --> 01:55:37.396
Okay. I give you my word on it.

01:55:38.981 --> 01:55:42.901
Is everything gonna be okay?
Are you all right?

01:55:46.989 --> 01:55:50.701
Yeah, everything's gonna be all right,
boy.

01:55:58.208 --> 01:56:00.794
I kind of wanna put my arm
around you for a minute...

01:56:00.919 --> 01:56:04.298
then I'm gonna get up
and leave out of here.

01:56:32.284 --> 01:56:35.204
I love you, boy.

01:56:36.788 --> 01:56:38.707
I love you too.

01:56:42.586 --> 01:56:45.297
All right, then.

01:57:25.212 --> 01:57:27.589
What are you doing here?
You wanna come in?

01:57:27.714 --> 01:57:32.302
I ain't staying.
I need to ask you for a favor.

01:57:34.388 --> 01:57:37.683
This evening
I want you to go get Miss Wheatley...

01:57:37.808 --> 01:57:41.895
and let her and Frank
stay over here with you tonight.

01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:44.481
What's wrong?
Is everything all right?

01:57:44.606 --> 01:57:46.817
That Doyle...

01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:51.696
he's in a bad way again with
that drinking and being mean to folks.

01:57:51.697 --> 01:57:54.198
I want you to give me your word
you'll do it.

01:57:54.199 --> 01:57:57.202
Sure. Okay.
He hasn't hurt them, has he?

01:57:57.286 --> 01:57:59.621
No, sir.
Not yet.

01:58:00.706 --> 01:58:02.416
Here.

01:58:02.499 --> 01:58:04.917
I want you to give that
to Miss Wheatley.

01:58:04.918 --> 01:58:06.919
It ain't much...

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:10.215
but they might be
a little something there to help out.

01:58:10.299 --> 01:58:14.219
It's what I made fixing lawn mowers
and whatnot for Bill Cox.

01:58:15.804 --> 01:58:18.682
How about you, Karl?
You wanna stay here?

01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:25.522
I don't reckon that you have to go with
women to be a good daddy to a boy.

01:58:25.606 --> 01:58:28.901
You been real square
dealing with me.

01:58:28.984 --> 01:58:32.696
Bible says two men
ought not lay together.

01:58:34.406 --> 01:58:39.995
But I bet you the good Lord
wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades.

01:58:41.413 --> 01:58:44.917
That boy... Frank...

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:48.294
He lives inside of his own heart.

01:58:48.295 --> 01:58:51.215
That's an awful big place to live in.

01:58:53.217 --> 01:58:55.802
You take care of that boy.

01:58:59.389 --> 01:59:02.100
I will.

02:01:55.899 --> 02:01:57.901
Where's everybody else?

02:02:05.492 --> 02:02:07.411
You seen them?

02:02:14.793 --> 02:02:18.297
Didn't I tell you
to get moved out of here?

02:02:21.717 --> 02:02:25.304
How does a feller go about
getting hold of the police?

02:02:31.518 --> 02:02:34.313
Use the fucking phone, I guess.

02:02:35.606 --> 02:02:37.900
Which numbers do you put in?

02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:49.119
Can't you see I'm trying to relax?

02:02:51.288 --> 02:02:55.292
I thought I told you
to get out of here and leave me alone.

02:03:00.422 --> 02:03:02.925
What the hell you doing
with that lawn mower blade?

02:03:03.884 --> 02:03:06.386
I aim to kill you with it.

02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:22.903
To call the police you push...

02:03:22.986 --> 02:03:27.407
nine, one, one.

02:03:32.704 --> 02:03:35.415
Just tell them
to bring an ambulance.

02:03:38.502 --> 02:03:41.797
Or a "hearst,"
if you're gonna kill me.

02:04:41.398 --> 02:04:43.692
Yes, ma'am.

02:04:43.817 --> 02:04:46.695
I need the police
sent over here to the Wheatley house.

02:04:49.907 --> 02:04:55.120
I've killed Doyle Hargraves
with a lawn mower blade.

02:04:55.204 --> 02:04:59.291
Yes, ma'am.
I'm right sure of it.

02:04:59.416 --> 02:05:02.085
I hit him
two good whacks with it.

02:05:02.211 --> 02:05:06.507
That second one
just plumb near cut his head in two.

02:05:09.801 --> 02:05:12.012
It's a little old white house...

02:05:12.095 --> 02:05:16.807
on the corner of Vine Street
and some other street.

02:05:16.808 --> 02:05:22.105
There's a truck out front, says
"Doyle Hargraves Construction" on it.

02:05:24.816 --> 02:05:27.611
I'll be sitting here
waiting on you.

02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:32.491
And Doyle said
besides sending the police...

02:05:32.616 --> 02:05:34.826
you might wanna send an ambulance...

02:05:34.910 --> 02:05:37.287
or a "hearst."

02:05:38.789 --> 02:05:40.791
Thank you.

02:06:44.396 --> 02:06:45.898
So...

02:06:47.024 --> 02:06:50.819
now on the third day...

02:06:50.903 --> 02:06:55.991
I washed her,
'cause she wasn't too clean, you know.

02:06:56.116 --> 02:06:58.911
But I got all the right spots.

02:06:58.994 --> 02:07:00.913
She was the first one I ever kept...

02:07:00.996 --> 02:07:06.001
'cause I get bored real easy...
I got a short attention span, you know.

02:07:07.628 --> 02:07:13.091
Now I can't say
that she enjoyed her stay...

02:07:15.719 --> 02:07:20.224
with that washcloth I put in her mouth
and held in place with duct tape.

02:07:20.307 --> 02:07:22.308
Kept her complaining down to a minimum.

02:07:22.309 --> 02:07:24.603
I don't like people
who talk all the time.

02:07:24.686 --> 02:07:27.105
I like to do all the talking.

02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:30.317
That's why I think I'm
so fond of you...

02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:33.320
'cause you just so easygoing, you know.

02:07:36.198 --> 02:07:40.827
Although, I do sense a little tension
in you from time to time.

02:07:43.705 --> 02:07:46.708
So you were out in the world?

02:07:48.293 --> 02:07:51.088
Did you have fun?
Did you make any acquaintances?

02:07:52.214 --> 02:07:55.801
There was a boy.
We made friends.

02:07:55.926 --> 02:07:57.803
I'll bet you did.

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:05.894
I was never bent that way.
I was bent the other way.

02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:08.814
So?

02:08:10.399 --> 02:08:15.112
What was it like out there
in the world?

02:08:16.405 --> 02:08:18.323
It was too big.

02:08:21.493 --> 02:08:23.912
It's not too big in here, is it?

02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:34.797
You know something?

02:08:34.798 --> 02:08:36.800
I feel real...

02:08:37.926 --> 02:08:40.512
generous today...
I feel like listening.

02:08:41.805 --> 02:08:44.308
I bet you got plenty to tell.

02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:52.566
Who'd you kill?

02:08:53.692 --> 02:08:56.028
Was it the boy?

02:08:56.111 --> 02:08:59.323
Don't you say nothing
about that boy.

02:09:05.621 --> 02:09:10.124
Fact of business,
don't you say another word to me.

02:09:10.125 --> 02:09:13.420
I ain't listening to you no more.

02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:29.728
Yeah.
