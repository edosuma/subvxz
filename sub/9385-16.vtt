WERE FOR THE FAMILY.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.650
NO, THE REST WERE
FROM THE FAMILY.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.528
WEREN'T... WEREN'T THEY?

08:06.612 --> 08:08.030
AW, CRAP.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.114
SINCE WHEN DID THEY CHANGE

08:09.198 --> 08:10.741
THE MEANING OF
"FOR" TO "FROM"?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.367
I THINK THEY HAD A MEETING
ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT.

08:12.451 --> 08:13.493
WHY WASN'T I TOLD?

08:13.577 --> 08:14.703
THEY SENT YOU A CARD

08:14.786 --> 08:16.205
BUT IT SAID
"FOR PETER" ON IT

08:16.288 --> 08:17.748
SO YOU MUST'VE THOUGHT
IT WAS "FROM" YOU

08:17.831 --> 08:19.374
SO YOU DIDN'T, UH...

08:19.917 --> 08:21.835
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST EASIER
TO CALL YOU "STUPID."

08:27.341 --> 08:29.176
YOU'RE REALLY GOING
TO TAKE BACK

08:29.259 --> 08:30.802
DONATED GIFTS
ON CHRISTMAS EVE?

08:30.886 --> 08:32.721
YEP. NOW, HERE'S THE PLAN--

08:32.804 --> 08:35.307
YOU'LL ENTER THROUGH
THE AIR CONDITIONING DUCT HERE.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.351
NOW, THERE'LL BE
AN INVISIBLE LASER GRID

08:37.434 --> 08:38.894
THREE INCHES
ABOVE THE FLOOR

08:38.977 --> 08:40.729
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO COMPRESS
YOUR BODY

08:40.812 --> 08:42.981
TO THE SIZE OF AN ORDINARY
HOUSEHOLD SPONGE

08:43.065 --> 08:44.233
AND SLIDE UNDERNEATH

08:44.316 --> 08:46.151
LIKE SOME KIND OF WEIRD,
AMPHIBIOUS DOLPHIN.

08:46.235 --> 08:47.903
CAN I BUY SOME
POT FROM YOU?

08:47.986 --> 08:49.738
WHAT YOU WANT?

08:49.821 --> 08:50.822
(both gasping)

08:50.906 --> 08:52.741
SO YOU UNDERSTAND
ALL THESE GIFTS

08:52.824 --> 08:54.743
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR MY FAMILY.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.245
IT WAS JUST
SOME CRAZY MIX-UP.

08:56.328 --> 08:57.538
(nervous laughter)

08:58.789 --> 09:00.040
KILL 'EM.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.626
NO, NO, NO, IT'S TRUE!

09:02.709 --> 09:04.962
SEE, THAT REMOTE CONTROL CAR
WAS FOR MY SON AND...

09:05.045 --> 09:07.005
AND THOSE BARRETTES
WERE FOR MY DAUGHTER

09:07.089 --> 09:09.049
AND, UH... HEY,
WHERE'S MY VCR?

09:09.132 --> 09:11.844
DANG IT, BUCK, IT'S MY
TURN TO USE THE SEX BOX.

09:11.927 --> 09:13.720
IT'S MY SEX BOX...

09:13.804 --> 09:15.848
AND HER NAME
IS "SONY."

09:15.931 --> 09:16.974
Lois:
YOU GAVE AWAY

09:17.057 --> 09:18.225
ALL THE PRESENTS?

09:18.308 --> 09:19.977
LOIS, IF YOU
STRIKE ME DOWN

09:20.060 --> 09:21.937
I SHALL BECOME
MORE POWERFUL

09:22.020 --> 09:23.856
THAN YOU CAN
POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

09:23.939 --> 09:26.108
PETER, YOU BROUGHT
GLAD TIDINGS TO A FAMILY

09:26.191 --> 09:27.568
LESS FORTUNATE
THAN YOUR OWN.

09:27.651 --> 09:28.944
YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT MAD?

09:29.027 --> 09:30.487
WELL, I AM
A LITTLE IRRITATED

09:30.571 --> 09:32.823
THAT I HAVE TO DO
ALL THE SHOPPING AGAIN

09:32.906 --> 09:34.950
BUT AT LEAST SOME GOOD
CAME OUT OF IT.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.785
SO I CAN DRINK BEER
AND WATCH TV?

09:36.869 --> 09:39.037
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
KISS SAVES SANTA IS ON.

09:39.121 --> 09:41.373
BUT, MRS. CLAUS,
WHO WOULD KIDNAP SANTA?

09:41.456 --> 09:44.585
WELL, ACE, THAT'S WHAT
I WANT YOU BOYS TO FIND OUT.

09:44.668 --> 09:45.919
SOMEONE STOLE SANTA?

09:46.003 --> 09:47.379
THAT DOES NOT ROCK!

09:47.462 --> 09:48.463
EASY, GENE.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.674
GUYS, LET'S GO
SAVE CHRISTMAS.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.259
TO THE KISS COPTER!

09:52.342 --> 09:53.677
- YAY!
- YAY!

09:59.433 --> 10:02.227
YOU CAN WATCH
ALL THE TV YOU WANT...

10:02.311 --> 10:03.604
JUST AS SOON AS WE GET BACK
FROM THE MALL.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.439
THE MALL?!
ON CHRISTMAS EVE?!

10:05.522 --> 10:07.399
PETER, I JUST
WANT THIS FAMILY

10:07.482 --> 10:09.151
TO HAVE
A PERFECT CHRISTMAS

10:09.234 --> 10:11.236
AND I NEED
A LITTLE HELP, OKAY?

10:11.612 --> 10:12.946
BRIAN, MY TURKEY'S
IN THE OVEN.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.031
CAN YOU TURN IT OFF
AT 3:00?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.324
NO PROBLEM.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.909
WE'LL SHOP, COME HOME, EAT

10:16.992 --> 10:18.827
AND THEN IT'S OFF
TO THE PAGEANT

10:18.911 --> 10:21.121
TO SEE OUR LITTLE STEWIE
PLAY BABY JESUS.

10:21.205 --> 10:24.583
OH, YES, YES, BY ALL MEANS
TURN ME INTO A CHILD STAR.

10:24.666 --> 10:27.211
PERHAPS I CAN MOVE
TO "CALI-FORN-EYE-AY"

10:27.294 --> 10:29.338
AND WRANGLE ME A THREE-WAY
WITH THE OLSEN TWINS.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.595
THERE'S A SPOT!

10:36.678 --> 10:38.388
(engine revving)

10:38.472 --> 10:39.932
AW, SCREW THIS.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.016
(tires squealing)

10:47.689 --> 10:50.984
OKAY, PETER, WE'LL EACH TAKE
HALF THE LIST TO SAVE TIME.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.904
KIDS, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE STEWIE TO SEE SANTA?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.657
SANTA?

10:58.408 --> 11:00.118
OH, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!

11:00.202 --> 11:02.204
SITTING ALONE
IN THIS PUBLIC SETTING?

11:02.287 --> 11:03.914
NO BULLETPROOF GLASS?

11:03.997 --> 11:06.124
CLAUS, YOU MAKE IT TOO EASY.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.793
CHANGE ME-- I'VE LEAKED
THROUGH MY SKI PANTS

11:07.876 --> 11:09.044
AND I WON'T FACE HIM WET!

11:14.591 --> 11:17.553
We now return to Bob Hope's
Christmas with the Troops.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.179
Hey, it's good to see
you Union boys.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.722
I would've been here sooner

11:20.806 --> 11:22.766
but Lincoln gave me
the wrong Gettysburg Address.

11:24.643 --> 11:26.520
And how about this having
to sit still for 60 seconds

11:26.603 --> 11:27.688
to have your picture taken?

11:27.771 --> 11:28.772
How about that?

11:28.897 --> 11:30.065
(troops laughing)

11:32.526 --> 11:33.527
AW, SWEET!

11:33.610 --> 11:34.611
IT'S KISS SAVES SANTA.

11:34.695 --> 11:35.696
Hang on, Santa!

11:35.779 --> 11:36.822
WE'RE COMING.

11:36.905 --> 11:37.906
HURRY, BOYS!

11:37.990 --> 11:39.032
THE EGGS ARE HATCHING!

11:39.116 --> 11:40.117
WHAT DO WE DO?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.201
WAIT A SECOND--

11:41.285 --> 11:42.953
EVERYONE KNOWS
PTERODACTYLS

11:43.036 --> 11:44.788
CAN'T STAND THE
SCREECH OF A GUITAR!

11:44.872 --> 11:46.874
(electrified screeching)

11:49.585 --> 11:50.752
IT'S WORKING!

11:50.836 --> 11:51.837
HEY, SANTA,
BE CAREFUL!

11:51.920 --> 11:53.130
OH, NO!
CAREFUL, SANTA!

11:53.213 --> 11:54.214
HANG ON, SANTA!

11:56.633 --> 11:58.552
HEY, I WAS WATCHING THAT! HEY!

11:58.635 --> 12:00.095
IT'LL BE ON
NEXT CHRISTMAS.

12:00.179 --> 12:02.097
WELL, WHO THE HELL KNOWS
WHEN THAT'S GOING TO BE?

12:03.807 --> 12:05.809
(bell dings)

12:11.440 --> 12:12.441
AH!

12:14.318 --> 12:16.236
IF I WAS AN OVEN MITT...

12:16.320 --> 12:17.696
(smoke alarm beeping)

12:26.455 --> 12:27.623
DAMN IT, PETER!

12:30.209 --> 12:31.418
HO, HO, HO.

12:31.502 --> 12:34.004
AND WHAT CAN I BRING YOU,
THIS YEAR?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.088
OH, A PEACE
OFFERING, IS IT?

12:35.172 --> 12:36.340
VERY WELL.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.884
WHAT SAY YOU TRIM THOSE
GIN-SOAKED WHISKERS

12:38.967 --> 12:40.511
AND BRING ME
SOME PLUTONIUM?

12:40.594 --> 12:42.930
WELL, CAN YOU
BE A GOOD BOY?

12:43.013 --> 12:45.015
HMM, YOUR INQUIRY
INTRIGUES ME.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.391
CAN ANY OF US
BE A GOOD BOY?

12:46.475 --> 12:48.310
ARE OUR PRIMAL URGES
INNATE OR THE RESULT

12:48.393 --> 12:49.478
OF THE CHOICES WE MAKE?

12:49.561 --> 12:50.896
OKAY, WRAP IT UP, KID.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.272
ALL RIGHT, KRINGLE.

12:52.356 --> 12:53.649
IF THE REWARD
IS PLUTONIUM

12:53.732 --> 12:54.858
THEN YOUR WAGER
IS ACCEPTED.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.318
I WILL BE...

12:56.401 --> 12:57.402
NICE.

12:57.486 --> 12:58.612
GOOD BOY.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.405
NOW, SMILE
FOR THE CAMERA.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.449
YES, YES, SMILE!

13:02.533 --> 13:04.159
LIKE A GOOD BOY.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.044
AH...

13:15.671 --> 13:17.297
AHA!

13:17.381 --> 13:18.507
MEG'S BARRETTES.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.342
YOU MEAN
JULIE'S BARRETTES!

13:21.385 --> 13:23.554
YOU STILL WANT THEM,
YOU BONY OLD BLUE HAIR?

13:23.637 --> 13:24.638
OW, OW!

13:24.721 --> 13:25.764
TITTY TWISTER!

13:25.848 --> 13:26.974
OW, HURTS!

13:27.057 --> 13:28.100
HEY!

13:59.131 --> 14:00.132
AHA!

14:01.216 --> 14:02.259
ALL THE CLOWN FISH

14:02.342 --> 14:04.052
AND YELLOW TANGS IN THE WORLD

14:04.136 --> 14:05.137
CAN'T HELP YOU NOW.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.267
THAT'S IT?

14:10.350 --> 14:11.560
FISH FOOD?

14:11.643 --> 14:13.270
THAT'S YOUR ACE
IN THE HOLE?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.522
(laughs)

14:15.647 --> 14:17.566
OW, OW... OW, OW, OW!

14:21.361 --> 14:22.362
TURKEY!

14:26.742 --> 14:27.743
(glass breaking)

14:30.204 --> 14:31.663
OH, LOIS, IT WAS HORRIBLE.

14:31.747 --> 14:32.998
THE FISH WERE JUMPING

14:33.081 --> 14:34.416
ALL OVER MY EYES
AND IN MY NOSE

14:34.499 --> 14:36.376
AND ON THE WAY OUT,
I THINK ONE OF THEM

14:36.460 --> 14:37.961
MUTTERED SOMETHING ANTI-SEMITIC.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.296
WE'RE ALMOST HOME, HONEY.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.464
OH, LOOK!

14:40.547 --> 14:42.633
THERE'S THE STAR
ON THE TOWN CHRISTMAS TREE.

14:42.716 --> 14:43.967
WE'RE FOLLOWING
IT HOME.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.469
JUST LIKE THE THREE WISE MEN.

14:45.636 --> 14:46.929
SO, WHAT'D YOU
GET HIM?

14:47.012 --> 14:48.013
GOLD.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.139
GOLD?

14:49.223 --> 14:50.349
AH, I THOUGHT
WE AGREED ON

14:50.432 --> 14:51.600
A FIVE DOLLAR
LIMIT, HERE.

14:51.683 --> 14:52.684
YEAH,
I JUST GOT HIM

14:52.809 --> 14:53.936
A CRAPPY LITTLE
BOTTLE OF MYRRH.

14:54.019 --> 14:55.562
HELLO!
FRANKINCENSE.

14:55.646 --> 14:56.939
YOU ALWAYS
DO THIS.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.023
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.316
LOOK, WE'LL PUT
EVERYTHING TOGETHER

14:59.399 --> 15:00.526
AND PUT ALL
OUR NAMES ON IT.

15:00.609 --> 15:01.610
NO!

15:01.693 --> 15:02.694
THAT IS
SO CHEAP.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.238
(all talking at once)

15:07.115 --> 15:08.909
(gasps)

15:08.992 --> 15:10.911
(turkey sizzling)

15:10.994 --> 15:11.995
OH, MY GOD.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.413
BRIAN, ARE
YOU OKAY?

15:13.497 --> 15:14.831
I TOLD YOU

15:14.915 --> 15:16.291
WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT
COOKIES FOR SANTA.

15:18.001 --> 15:19.461
(screams)

15:21.046 --> 15:22.881
MY COUCH, MY TV!

15:22.965 --> 15:24.049
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO?

15:24.132 --> 15:25.133
ME?

15:25.217 --> 15:27.010
WHO THE HELL
BUYS A NOVELTY FIRE EXTINGUISHER?

15:27.094 --> 15:28.554
I'LL TELL YOU WHO.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.181
SOMEONE WHO CARES ENOUGH
ABOUT PHYSICAL COMEDY

15:31.265 --> 15:33.016
TO PUT HIS WHOLE
FAMILY AT SERIOUS RISK.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.685
BOYS, PLEASE!

15:34.768 --> 15:36.311
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE.

15:36.395 --> 15:39.523
THIS IS A NIGHT FOR MAGIC
AND WONDER AND JOY.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.359
OKAY, SO A COUPLE
OF THINGS HAVE GONE WRONG

15:42.442 --> 15:44.820
BUT WE CAN STILL HAVE
A GREAT CHRISTMAS!

15:45.988 --> 15:46.989
(sighs)

15:47.072 --> 15:48.365
AH, JEEZ, KIDS.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.491
I WAS THIS CLOSE
TO LOSING IT

15:49.575 --> 15:50.576
BUT YOUR MOM'S RIGHT.

15:50.659 --> 15:52.452
WELL, SURE I AM.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.580
MEG, HONEY, GET ME
SOME PAPER TOWELS.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.248
LET'S LOSE THE
BAD TIDINGS

15:56.331 --> 15:58.792
CLEAN UP THIS MESS
AND FIND THAT HOLIDAY CHEER.

15:58.876 --> 15:59.918
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

16:00.002 --> 16:02.171
WE'RE OUT OF PAPER TOWELS.

16:02.254 --> 16:05.841
NO... PAPER... TOWELS!

16:05.924 --> 16:09.011
(screaming)

16:10.679 --> 16:12.014
HEY, I WAS GOING
TO PICK AT THAT.

16:12.097 --> 16:13.765
SHUT YOUR FAT MOUTH!

16:13.849 --> 16:16.101
YOU ALL THINK
CHRISTMAS JUST HAPPENS.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.644
YOU THINK ALL THIS GOODWILL

16:17.728 --> 16:19.146
JUST FALLS
FROM THE FREAKIN' SKY!

16:19.229 --> 16:20.355
WELL, IT DOESN'T!

16:20.439 --> 16:22.399
IT FALLS OUT
OF MY HOLLY JOLLY BUTT!

16:23.942 --> 16:25.777
SO YOU CAN COOK
YOUR OWN DAMN TURKEY

16:25.861 --> 16:27.279
WRAP YOUR OWN
DAMN PRESENTS

16:27.362 --> 16:28.530
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT

16:28.614 --> 16:30.449
YOU CAN ALL RIDE
A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH

16:30.532 --> 16:31.533
TO HELL!

16:32.492 --> 16:34.203
(screaming)

16:34.286 --> 16:37.623
(panting and muttering)

16:39.291 --> 16:41.084
OH, HERE'S THE
PAPER TOWELS.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.173
I-I-I CHANGED MY MIND.

16:46.256 --> 16:47.966
CLARENCE, I WANT TO LIVE AGAIN.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.051
I WANT TO LIVE AGAIN.

16:49.134 --> 16:50.135
WHOA!

16:50.219 --> 16:51.261
(splash)

16:54.348 --> 16:56.016
HEY!

16:56.099 --> 16:58.352
I GUESS THERE'S SOME MAGIC
IN THAT OLD SILK HAT.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.478
(Lois growling)

16:59.561 --> 17:00.771
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

17:00.854 --> 17:01.855
(socks)

17:01.939 --> 17:02.940
EASY, LADY!

17:03.065 --> 17:04.107
YOU WANT SOME
OF THIS?

17:04.191 --> 17:05.192
(laughs and pants)

17:06.276 --> 17:07.277
AH!

17:07.361 --> 17:08.529
WHAT THE HELL
IS HER PROBLEM?

17:08.612 --> 17:09.905
FROSTY,
LET IT GO!

17:09.988 --> 17:11.323
JUST A SECOND, JUST A SECOND.

17:11.406 --> 17:12.950
HEY, LADY, YOU GOT
SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME?

17:13.033 --> 17:14.159
YEAH, ALL HE DID

17:14.243 --> 17:15.285
WAS WISH YOU
A MERRY CHRISTMAS.

17:15.369 --> 17:16.537
WISH?

17:16.620 --> 17:17.996
IT'S EASY TO WISH

17:18.080 --> 17:19.456
BUT DOES ANYONE
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

17:19.540 --> 17:20.791
AND MAKE IT HAPPEN?

17:20.874 --> 17:22.251
NO!

17:22.376 --> 17:24.044
YOU ALL EXPECT
SOMEONE ELSE TO DO IT FOR YOU.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.754
LIKE SANTY CLAUS

17:25.838 --> 17:26.839
OR MOMMY!

17:26.922 --> 17:28.090
AH, AH, AH!

17:33.345 --> 17:34.429
AH, TAKE IT OFF!

17:34.513 --> 17:35.514
TAKE IT OFF!

17:38.016 --> 17:42.062
MUST... KILL... STAR.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.981
DAD, WHAT HAPPENED TO MOM?

17:44.064 --> 17:46.233
WHAT IF SHE NEVER COMES BACK?

17:46.316 --> 17:47.985
I-I-I THINK THE
BIGGER QUESTION

17:48.068 --> 17:49.736
IS IF THIS IS THE
WAY SHE'S GOING TO ACT AT CHRISTMAS

17:49.820 --> 17:50.863
DO WE EVEN
WANT HER BACK?

17:50.946 --> 17:52.155
ALL RIGHT,
WHICH IS BETTER?

17:52.239 --> 17:53.824
AROUND THE WAIST
OR OFF THE SHOULDER?

17:53.907 --> 17:54.992
WAIST? SHOULDER?

17:55.117 --> 17:56.118
WAIST? SHOULDER?

17:56.201 --> 17:57.202
STEWIE, I THOUGHT

17:57.286 --> 17:58.662
YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO BE IN THE PAGEANT.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.038
OH, MEGAN!

18:00.122 --> 18:01.999
SANTA WOULD THINK IT
TERRIBLY NAUGHTY OF ME

18:02.082 --> 18:03.959
NOT TO FULFILL MY OBLIGATION
TO MOTHER.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.044
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
THE PAGEANT MEANS TO HER.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.546
WHERE DO YOU THINK SHE IS?

18:07.629 --> 18:08.881
WELL, THANK GOD

18:08.964 --> 18:11.008
YEARS AGO I PLANTED
A HOMING DEVICE

18:11.091 --> 18:13.260
IN YOUR MOTHER'S SKULL
FOR JUST SUCH AN OCCASION.

18:13.343 --> 18:14.720
(computer beeping)

18:14.803 --> 18:16.763
I FORGOT, I ALSO
PUT THEM IN A BUNCH OF SQUIRRELS.

18:16.847 --> 18:18.390
THIS ISN'T GOING
TO DO US ANY GOOD.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.058
MAY AS WELL
SEE IF SHE'S AT THE PAGEANT.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.143
YOU...

18:21.226 --> 18:23.604
YOU LIED TO ME.

18:23.687 --> 18:24.688
OH, MY GOD!

18:24.771 --> 18:26.315
THERE'S MOM!

18:26.398 --> 18:27.399
HI, LOIS!

18:27.482 --> 18:28.567
HEY, DO WE LOOK
LIKE ANTS DOWN HERE?

18:28.650 --> 18:29.693
BITE ME!

18:29.776 --> 18:30.777
(glass breaking)

18:30.861 --> 18:32.070
PETER, GREAT
TIME LAST NIGHT.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.155
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL GET LOIS DOWN.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.239
LOCKED AND
LOADED, SIR.

18:34.323 --> 18:35.365
WAIT!

18:35.449 --> 18:36.450
YOU CAN'T SHOOT MY MOM.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.534
DON'T WORRY, KID.

18:37.618 --> 18:38.952
IT'S JUST A
MILD SEDATIVE.

18:39.036 --> 18:40.037
GO!

18:40.662 --> 18:41.663
JOE, HANG ON.

18:41.914 --> 18:43.415
LOOK, LOIS IS
ONLY UP THERE

18:43.498 --> 18:44.958
BECAUSE WE SUCKED
THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT

18:45.042 --> 18:46.043
RIGHT OUT OF HER.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.377
MAYBE IF SHE SEES
THE PAGEANT

18:47.461 --> 18:48.462
IT'LL BRING HER AROUND.

18:48.545 --> 18:49.546
GIVE HER A CHANCE, HUH?

18:49.671 --> 18:50.672
TRUST HIM, JOE.

18:50.797 --> 18:51.798
THIS MAN HAS SEEN

18:51.882 --> 18:53.008
EVERY CHRISTMAS
SPECIAL EVER MADE.

18:53.091 --> 18:54.468
ARE YOU WEARING
A GIRL'S SWEATER?

18:54.551 --> 18:55.928
DOES THAT REALLY
MATTER RIGHT NOW?

18:56.011 --> 18:57.012
YOU GOT TEN MINUTES.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.264
LIGHTS, PLEASE.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.809
AS WE ALL KNOW

19:02.893 --> 19:05.020
CHRISTMAS IS THAT MYSTICAL
TIME OF YEAR

19:05.103 --> 19:07.773
WHEN THE GHOST OF JESUS
RISES FROM THE GRAVE

19:07.856 --> 19:10.067
TO FEED ON THE FLESH
OF THE LIVING.

19:10.150 --> 19:13.612
SO, WE ALL SING CHRISTMAS CAROLS
TO LULL HIM BACK TO SLEEP.

19:13.695 --> 19:14.863
OUTRAGEOUS!

19:14.947 --> 19:16.281
HOW DARE HE SAY SUCH BLASPHEMY!

19:16.365 --> 19:17.616
I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

19:17.699 --> 19:18.992
BOB, THERE'S
NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

19:19.076 --> 19:20.202
(sighs)

19:20.285 --> 19:22.079
WELL, I... GUESS
I'LL JUST HAVE TO

19:22.162 --> 19:23.747
DEVELOP A SENSE OF HUMOR.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.125
I AM THE VIRGIN MARY.

19:27.292 --> 19:30.087
THAT'S MY STORY
AND I'M STICKING TO IT.

19:30.254 --> 19:33.298
OH, OUR SAVIOR HAS ARRIVED.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.801
GOOD EVENING.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.928
I'M PLAYING THE ROLE
OF JESUS

19:38.011 --> 19:39.721
A MAN ONCE PORTRAYED
ON THE BIG SCREEN

19:39.805 --> 19:41.014
BY JEFFREY HUNTER.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.891
YOU MAY REMEMBER HIM
AS THE ACTOR

19:42.975 --> 19:44.434
WHO WAS REPLACED
BY WILLIAM SHATNER

19:44.518 --> 19:45.561
ON STAR TREK.

19:45.644 --> 19:46.979
APPARENTLY, MR. HUNTER

19:47.062 --> 19:48.438
WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO DIE
FOR OUR SINS

19:48.522 --> 19:51.191
BUT NOT QUITE UP TO THE TASK
OF SEDUCING GREEN WOMEN.

19:53.277 --> 19:54.695
ANYHOO...

19:54.778 --> 19:56.154
THE PERENNIAL DICTUM IS

19:56.238 --> 19:58.574
TO SPREAD GOODWILL
TOWARDS ALL MEN.

19:58.657 --> 19:59.908
THE IRONY, OF COURSE

19:59.992 --> 20:01.493
IS THAT THIS IS CONTRARY
TO OUR NATURE.

20:01.577 --> 20:03.078
SO, WHY DO WE DO IT?

20:03.161 --> 20:05.455
BECAUSE WE ARE BEING WATCHED.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.710
AND SO...

20:09.793 --> 20:11.628
WE UNSELFISHLY THINK OF OTHERS

20:11.712 --> 20:14.464
ASSURED THAT OUR GOOD BEHAVIOR
WILL BE REWARDED

20:14.548 --> 20:17.050
WITH LOVE... AND PLUTONIUM.

20:19.595 --> 20:21.096
YEAH, SHE'S NOT GETTING IT.

20:21.180 --> 20:22.222
OKAY, BOYS, TAKE HER DOWN.

20:31.023 --> 20:32.149
MERRY CHRISTMAS, BUDDY.

20:32.316 --> 20:34.693
HUH, WONDER WHAT THIS COULD BE.

20:34.776 --> 20:35.819
OH.

20:35.903 --> 20:38.989
THIS CHRISTMAS ROCKS!

20:39.072 --> 20:40.657
MOM, STEWIE'S
OPENING HIS GIFTS.

20:40.741 --> 20:41.909
MOM?

20:41.992 --> 20:43.243
AH, IT'S OKAY, MEG.

20:43.327 --> 20:45.120
YOUR MOM'S JUST FULL
OF CHRISTMAS CHEER

20:45.204 --> 20:47.372
AND ENOUGH TRANQUILIZER
TO BRING DOWN A BULL ELEPHANT.

20:47.456 --> 20:49.625
UH, HONEY,
YOU GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING

20:49.708 --> 20:51.043
YOU GOT A LITTLE...

20:51.126 --> 20:52.127
UH... I'LL GET IT.

20:52.211 --> 20:55.339
HUNGRY, HUNGRY HIPPOS?!

20:55.422 --> 20:58.300
KLAUS,
YOU PORCINE DOUBLE-CROSSER.

20:58.383 --> 21:00.260
AND TO THINK, I WAS NICE!

21:00.385 --> 21:01.762
YOU GOT ANOTHER ONE, DUDE.

21:03.138 --> 21:04.139
(gasps)

21:04.223 --> 21:05.474
PLUTONIUM!

21:05.557 --> 21:07.142
H-HE IS REAL.

21:07.226 --> 21:09.311
HE'S REALLY, REALLY REAL!

21:09.478 --> 21:10.646
SO, PETER
DID YOU GET EVERYTHING

21:10.729 --> 21:11.772
YOU WANTED
FOR CHRISTMAS?

21:11.897 --> 21:14.149
YOU BET!
A WEEK'S VACATION, A NEW VCR

21:14.233 --> 21:17.486
AND BEST OF ALL,
MY OWN COPY OF KISS SAVES SANTA.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.949
YOU JUST PRACTICE
THAT GUITAR, SANTA.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.493
NEXT TIME, WE'LL
LET YOU DO A SOLO.

21:24.576 --> 21:26.411
DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM!

21:26.787 --> 21:28.497
(all laughing)

21:33.961 --> 21:35.420
FROM ALL OF US AT FAMILY GUY

21:35.504 --> 21:37.381
WE WISH YOU
CHRISTMAS JOY

21:37.464 --> 21:39.299
MAY ALL YOUR WISHES
NOW COME TRUE

21:39.383 --> 21:41.009
FOR EVERY GIRL AND BOY

21:41.093 --> 21:42.636
WE HOPE YOUR FREAKIN' HOLIDAYS

21:42.719 --> 21:44.429
ARE FILLED WITH FUN AND CHEER

21:44.513 --> 21:46.765
SO HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS AND...

21:46.849 --> 21:49.059
(mumbling)
