Previously on Bates Motel...

00:03.840 --> 00:05.604
I'm kind of
with Bradley now.

00:05.680 --> 00:06.966
What's this based on?

00:07.520 --> 00:08.760
I slept with her.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.925
We came here to start over.
I am starting over!

00:13.120 --> 00:14.531
I love you.

00:17.280 --> 00:20.568
This is the girl. The girl I told you about.
The girl from the cop's basement.

This is not the man, right?

He is the man. (SHUDDERS)

We just have
to do it the right way.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.127
I had to see you. I know, I know,
I know we're not supposed to.

This is a bad idea...
No, it's perfect.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.726
This is all your fault.
I loved your mother,

taken care of her.

I began suspecting Shelby
of being corrupt a while back.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.484
This coincided with
a violent confrontation

03:03.600 --> 03:05.443

and Keith Summers,

03:05.880 --> 03:08.121
in which
Shelby killed Keith,

03:08.200 --> 03:09.611
and then he threw
his body in the bay.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.367
Shelby had one of the
girls in his possession.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.010
He was hiding her
on Keith's boat

03:14.280 --> 03:17.011
and I was starting to close
in on him at this point.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.361

of course.

Shh! Dylan.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.485
Shelby tried to
move the girl.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.800
That led to a showdown
right here on the property.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.682
I kill Zack Shelby
with this gun.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.810
I just need to see a driver's
license and a credit card.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.486
Thanks.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.970
So, you're, uh, been coming
here every two months?

18:00.280 --> 18:01.645
What kind
of work do you do?

18:01.840 --> 18:03.001
Sales.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.240
Hmm.

18:06.360 --> 18:09.523
What kind of sales,
Mr. Abernathy?

18:11.520 --> 18:13.010
Different kinds.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.366
All right. I'll need
to see a credit card.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.609
That ought to be enough for the
next few nights, won't it?

18:38.040 --> 18:39.530
Yeah.
Thanks.

18:53.240 --> 18:57.006
He paid in cash. Barely let
me see his driver's license.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.565
What exactly are you
cleaning out here?

19:02.040 --> 19:03.280
Blood.

19:04.120 --> 19:07.169
When Shelby fell,
he bled all over the steps.

19:09.240 --> 19:12.323
Stone's porous. You can't
scrub blood out of it.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.969
It'll wear off in time.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.609
No one's gonna know
that's what this is anyways.

19:19.720 --> 19:20.687
I'm gonna know.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.444
Every time I walk out the
door, it's gonna be,

19:22.520 --> 19:26.002
"Oh, what a beautiful day. Hey, that's
where Deputy Shelby bled to death."

19:27.000 --> 19:29.128
It's over, Norma, okay?
Just... Just let it go.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.328
Yeah, I would like to, but
apparently, everybody in town

19:31.440 --> 19:33.568
is talking about
what happened here.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.251
I think you might
be overreacting.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.931
I'm not overreacting!
It will affect things!

19:39.320 --> 19:40.970
If we don't do
a bang-up business,

19:41.320 --> 19:43.209
then we're gonna
be marked as failures.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.567
You know, if we have
a great opening weekend,

19:45.640 --> 19:49.326
then everybody will forget about it,
but I don't have a single reservation.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.290
So, I'm gonna be the
laughingstock of White Pine.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.283
That's not what
I moved here for!

out of stone, Norma.

I wanted to tell you.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.484
I'm gonna be moving out in a few
weeks when my arm gets better.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.204
I can't go with you.
I'm sorry.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.442
I mean, I can't leave Mom. Not
the way she is, you know?

20:17.160 --> 20:18.844
Yeah, it's okay.

for a few days.

by yourself there?

20:58.240 --> 20:59.651
Yeah, it's okay.

21:02.480 --> 21:03.845
You work for Gil, right?

21:04.600 --> 21:05.931

work with him.

21:06.360 --> 21:07.521
His name is Jerry Martin.

21:07.800 --> 21:11.327
Oh, shit. I'm...
I'm really sorry.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.407

to sleep with?

21:52.920 --> 21:53.921

21:55.720 --> 21:56.767
Oh, not yet.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.281

feel like going down.

or something.

likes you, right?

not to lead someone on.

give you directions.

How about you come with me and show me?
I'll buy you lunch.

Yeah, okay.
Okay? Okay.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.202
Emma, don't worry about Norman
if he seems distracted lately.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.930
He's just going
through something.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.331
Yeah, he seems
kind of distant.

26:45.400 --> 26:48.131
Yeah, a little.
Yeah, I noticed it, too.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.725
Have you?
Mmm.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.482
You wouldn't happen to know what he's
so preoccupied with lately, would you?

26:59.760 --> 27:01.000

want to be talking out of school.

I understand that.

he'll get over it.

I go to school with "it,"

27:19.800 --> 27:23.441
and I don't know how fast
he's gonna get over her.

with this girl?

can't even hate her.

her physical being?

35:23.640 --> 35:25.051
Bradley, we need to talk.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.361
Okay-

35:33.400 --> 35:34.890
You've been through a lot.

35:36.120 --> 35:38.248
You know, I understand this.
I lost my father, too.

35:39.880 --> 35:42.247
I know it can be confusing.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.528
But I also know that what
happened between us was real.

35:47.440 --> 35:48.646
Norman...
Just let me finish.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.051
There's no point
hiding from it anymore.

35:52.360 --> 35:53.725
I know how we feel
about each other.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.641
I know we're both
just scared and confused.

35:56.720 --> 35:57.801
I know we have
a connection.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.201
You know, 'cause I can feel it.
Every...

36:01.280 --> 36:02.725
Every time I see you,
it's there.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.762
And that night we
spent together was, uh...

36:10.720 --> 36:11.801
And I know it was
the same for you

36:11.880 --> 36:13.609
'cause you were there
with me, right?

36:15.640 --> 36:16.721
So I don't know
what's holding you back.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.167
I mean, you haven't
answered my texts.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.851
Maybe... Maybe you haven't broken
up with Richard yet or something,

36:21.920 --> 36:23.968
but you should.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.722
'Cause you and I...
We, uh...

36:31.000 --> 36:32.490
We're together, right?

36:36.080 --> 36:38.811
Norman, I don't feel
that way about you.

36:40.840 --> 36:43.127
What happened was just
something that happened.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.529
I'm really sorry.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.929
I shouldn't have done it
with someone like you.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.844
Someone like me?

37:01.800 --> 37:02.881
Norman!

37:11.800 --> 37:13.040
Norman!

37:14.600 --> 37:16.011
(SNIFFLING)

37:19.480 --> 37:20.811
Norman!

37:27.440 --> 37:30.046
"Personally, I don't think "nice
girls" come to your doorstep

37:30.120 --> 37:32.771
"looking for a guy
one day after he moves in.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.922
"Or sleep with someone
they barely know.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.048
"At the age of 17,
no less."

37:37.480 --> 37:38.925
I mean, really, what
kind of girl does that?

37:39.000 --> 37:41.606
Invites you over to have sex
with them after their dad dies?

37:41.680 --> 37:43.409
(PANTING) Norman.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.205
Are you okay?

37:54.040 --> 37:55.724
I don't think
you're a nice girl.

38:03.360 --> 38:06.489
(SIGHS) I'm really sorry.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.281
I'm really sorry.
I wish it was different.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.561
I have to go.

38:43.720 --> 38:44.926
I didn't mean
to startle you.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.001
(EXHALES)

38:46.080 --> 38:47.650
It's so quiet here.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.322
When do you
open exactly?

38:52.400 --> 38:53.561
In a few days.

38:53.640 --> 38:58.931
Well, I like the place a lot better
than when Keith Summers ran it.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.485
I like the progress.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.406
Thank you, yeah.
I'm trying.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.922
Are you booking
a lot of reservations?

39:08.320 --> 39:11.688
Um, not as many
as I'd hoped.

39:11.760 --> 39:15.162
Ah, it's so hard to get good
word of mouth started, isn't it?

39:16.680 --> 39:19.684
But that's what makes or
breaks a business like this.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.966
I do business with a lot of different
people in this general area.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.646
I could, uh,
put out the good word.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.450
Oh, that would be great. Thank you.
That would be great.

39:31.560 --> 39:33.050
My pleasure.
(CHUCKLES)

39:35.080 --> 39:37.048
I would love to have the
same business arrangement

39:37.120 --> 39:39.282
that I had with Keith,
if that's possible.

39:41.120 --> 39:43.964
You mean staying here every
other month in Room 9?

39:44.040 --> 39:45.963
Actually, it's a little
more than Room 9.

39:46.680 --> 39:49.047
I'd need the entire
block of rooms

39:49.120 --> 39:52.203
for the first week
of every other month.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.729
All the rooms? That's great.
That's wonderful. Yeah.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.804
What is it for? Is it for the
other people that you work with?

39:58.880 --> 40:00.405
Yeah, actually. Yes.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.086
Uh-huh.
What kind of work?

40:02.160 --> 40:03.241
Sales.

40:04.440 --> 40:05.487
Sales?

40:05.560 --> 40:09.963
I would pay you at the beginning of
each week for all the rooms in cash.

40:10.760 --> 40:12.922
And we like our privacy, so there's
no need to clean the rooms

40:13.000 --> 40:15.241
or do anything
for us during that week.

40:16.920 --> 40:19.161
But it's not anything
illegal, right?

40:20.160 --> 40:21.924
No, it's nothing illegal.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.570
(CHUCKLES) Okay,
then you're booked.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.688
Great. Thank you.

40:25.920 --> 40:27.160
You're welcome.

40:44.360 --> 40:45.486
(JUNO BARKS)

40:45.880 --> 40:47.325
(WHIMPERS)

40:50.840 --> 40:51.841
Hey, Juno.

40:53.480 --> 40:54.891
Come here, girl.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.170
(CAR APPROACHING)

40:58.240 --> 41:00.004
Stay.
(WHIMPERS)

41:01.280 --> 41:02.805
(BARKS) Stay!

41:02.960 --> 41:04.246
Stay!
(TIRES SCREECH)

41:09.560 --> 41:10.561
Juno.

41:11.040 --> 41:12.121
Oh, my God.
I didn't see her.

41:12.240 --> 41:13.480
She ran right in
front of the car.

41:13.560 --> 41:14.800
Norman!

41:16.040 --> 41:17.405
I killed my dog.

41:18.680 --> 41:21.251
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

41:23.120 --> 41:24.406
Norman,
get out of the street.

41:28.960 --> 41:29.961
What are you doing?

41:30.400 --> 41:33.210
I'm taking her to Emma's dad.
He can fix dead things.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.368
Can I help you?
Is he all right?

41:35.440 --> 41:36.487
Yes, he's all right.

41:37.560 --> 41:39.324
She's dead, Norman.
No one can fix her.

41:39.400 --> 41:42.051
I'm not gonna leave her in the street!
I'm taking her to Emma's!

41:42.120 --> 41:44.088
This is crazy.
(SHOUTS) It's not crazy!

41:47.600 --> 41:48.761
(SIGHS)

41:51.760 --> 41:55.287
Okay. Then I will
drive you, okay?

41:55.360 --> 41:57.010
I'll drive you.
Just stay here.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.647
(SOBS)
I was wrong, Mother.

42:04.280 --> 42:05.805
About everything.
(SOBBING)

42:10.840 --> 42:12.285
(SIGHS)

42:15.000 --> 42:16.968
I'm so sorry, honey.

42:19.960 --> 42:22.042
Go get the car, Mother.

42:22.960 --> 42:26.248
Okay. Okay.
