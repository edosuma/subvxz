CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:25.960 --> 00:27.960
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.680
On tonight's show,
we go supercar hunting

00:30.680 --> 00:32.640
in a Volkswagen Golf

00:32.640 --> 00:34.560
and discover the perfect runabout

00:34.560 --> 00:37.680
for the fashion-conscious
Bond villain.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.080
But first...

00:39.080 --> 00:41.440
let's talk about Aston Martin.

00:41.440 --> 00:44.640
Now, Aston Martin...
They've always made beautiful cars,

00:44.640 --> 00:49.520
but the truth is, in recent years,
Aston's been a bit left behind.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.560
You know when we first saw this DB9?

00:51.560 --> 00:53.240
2003.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.440
In car years, that's ancient, right?

00:56.440 --> 00:59.400
But now the DB9 has been
replaced by a new car,

00:59.400 --> 01:01.800
promising to bring Aston
right up to date.

01:04.080 --> 01:08.160
This is the all-new DB11.

01:08.160 --> 01:11.120
Aston Martin says it's
the most important model

01:11.120 --> 01:13.360
in its 100-year history.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.960
No pressure there, then(!)

01:17.560 --> 01:20.320
Thankfully, it still looks great.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.640
But look beneath the bodywork...

01:23.640 --> 01:25.480
and there are a few surprises.

01:28.080 --> 01:32.040
Aston's given the DB11
a smaller motor than the old DB9,

01:32.040 --> 01:33.880
and, for the first time ever,

01:33.880 --> 01:36.280
accessorized it with
a pair of turbochargers.

01:36.280 --> 01:39.320
Now, this... This is controversial.

01:40.840 --> 01:44.640
The free-revving,
naturally aspirated Aston Martin V12

01:44.640 --> 01:47.200
is a British institution,

01:47.200 --> 01:49.360
like the royal family, or...

01:49.360 --> 01:50.760
crumpets.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.960
Aston Martin going turbo
is big news.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.200
So, have they ruined it?

01:59.200 --> 02:01.000
Well...

02:01.000 --> 02:02.080
no.

02:06.320 --> 02:07.560
Not at all.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.240
In fact, this might just be the best
all-round Aston

02:12.240 --> 02:13.800
in the last 20 years.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.520
Or 40 years.

02:17.520 --> 02:18.560
Or...

02:19.680 --> 02:20.880
Damn, I'm old.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.640
The engine might be smaller...

02:25.640 --> 02:28.440
but those controversial
new turbochargers

02:28.440 --> 02:31.600
mean Aston's V12 now produces...

02:31.600 --> 02:34.600
600 horsepower...

02:34.600 --> 02:37.120
which is, you know, enough.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.040
Enough, in fact,
to make this the first DB car

02:40.040 --> 02:41.920
that'll do over 200mph.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.240
This thing goes like hell.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.400
Sounds like hell too.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.760
Woohoo!

02:55.920 --> 02:57.880
And, hey,
it's still rear-wheel drive,

02:57.880 --> 03:01.320
the gear box is still out the back
for better weight distribution,

03:01.320 --> 03:05.480
and now there's even proper
multi-link rear suspension.

03:05.480 --> 03:10.720
So if you do happen to accidentally
end up in a massive power slide...

03:15.080 --> 03:17.720
..then, yeah, it'll do that too.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.920
Whoops, there it goes again.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.280
I'm so careless.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.760
Now, some might complain
that this British icon

03:33.760 --> 03:39.000
has sourced all of its electronic
computery stuff from Mercedes...

03:39.000 --> 03:40.640
THUNDER CRACKS

03:40.640 --> 03:43.600
Frankly, I don't care if
the stuff behind the scenes

03:43.600 --> 03:46.560
is programmed by German guys
in wire-rimmed glasses.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.240
Doesn't bother me at all.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.880
Mostly because, unlike old Astons,

03:51.880 --> 03:53.640
it actually works.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.320
And besides...

03:56.320 --> 03:59.280
all the tactile stuff
is still just as it should be.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.320
This leather is very...

04:01.320 --> 04:02.480
leathery.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.240
And this metal...

04:04.240 --> 04:06.080
is very metally.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.600
And this wood is very...

04:08.600 --> 04:10.440
Ooh!

04:10.440 --> 04:12.520
I'm just kidding. That's nice wood.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.040
Now, the armrest...

04:14.040 --> 04:17.120
You don't have to go through
all that effort

04:17.120 --> 04:18.839
of manually sliding it back

04:18.839 --> 04:21.000
to get at that little bit of storage

04:21.000 --> 04:22.120
underneath there.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.600
No. There's a switch here

04:23.600 --> 04:25.000
that does that for you.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.280
I cannot believe that I have been

04:30.280 --> 04:32.120
manually sliding armrests

04:32.120 --> 04:34.360
all these years, like an ape.

04:35.880 --> 04:38.000
That is time I cannot get back.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.600
So, it's great to drive,

04:42.600 --> 04:44.840
great to spend time in...

04:45.960 --> 04:47.920
..but it should be.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.280
The DB11 is 155 grand...

04:51.400 --> 04:54.280
..which does raise
that old debate...

04:54.280 --> 04:57.480
For about half the money,
you could have a Nissan GT-R,

04:57.480 --> 05:00.480
which... has about the same power,

05:00.480 --> 05:02.560
and four-wheel drive,

05:02.560 --> 05:06.880
and will annihilate this Aston
around any circuit on Earth.

05:11.360 --> 05:15.080
But, come on,
that's not the point of the DB11.

05:15.080 --> 05:19.920
This is a luxury yacht,
not a speedboat.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.200
It's a private jet,
not a jet fighter.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.440
It's about understated elegance.

05:33.920 --> 05:41.480
Sophisticated, effortless, cool...
Yeah.

05:45.680 --> 05:50.400
Which means this race track is not
where the DB11 was meant to live.

05:51.480 --> 05:56.960
However, we've installed a useful
new feature on this race track.

05:56.960 --> 06:00.440
Narnia had its wardrobe,
Bill and Ted had their phone booth.

06:00.440 --> 06:04.480
And Stargate had its...
its Stargate.

06:04.480 --> 06:08.040
Well, Top Gear now
has its left at Hammerhead.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.920
That's right,
left turn at Hammerhead.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.520

07:03.880 --> 07:08.200
Oh. Would have be nice
if it came with the pants!

07:14.640 --> 07:18.920
Of course, every hero
needs a villain.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.240

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000

07:26.000 --> 07:28.680

07:31.520 --> 07:33.720
It's huge, it's ostentatious.

07:33.720 --> 07:38.640
I mean, I've got cameras that
scan the road ahead for bumps and,

07:38.640 --> 07:42.160
for some reason, I've got Swarovski
crystals in the headlights.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.040

13:52.680 --> 13:55.520
You love this Mercedes, right?

It's wonderful.
It's just a great car to be in.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.560
- And it's very subtle too, I like that.
- Yeah, it's not overstated.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.640
And you say you really like it.
But it does miss one thing.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.480
This one important thing
it doesn't have.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.440

- Yeah.

You're so vain, Matthew.
This badge here, this badge

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
- was founded by Karl Benz in 1885.
- Uh-huh.

He invented the motorcar.
This thing has provenance.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.320

that's relevant? I'll show you.

- but it's not an Aston Martin.
- Fair enough.
- Right, right?

15:07.840 --> 15:10.480
OK. Now, there is one thing to do.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.920
Find out how fast
a DB11 went around our test track.

15:12.920 --> 15:14.640
And you know what that means?

15:14.640 --> 15:16.200
It's time for... The Stig!

15:16.200 --> 15:18.040
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

15:19.080 --> 15:21.240
'Here he is, then,
on the line in the DB11.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.680
'600 horsepower, twin turbo, V12.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.680
'Pretty good traction off the line.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.680
'Howling up now,
past that heli shot.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.600
'Braking's on,
it looks heavy, doesn't it?

15:29.600 --> 15:31.480
'Look at the roll on the car
straight away.

15:31.480 --> 15:34.040
'Stig, very relaxed in there,
all leathery and woody.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.640
'Look, a bit of tyre smoke
coming out.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.520
'This thing's got so much power,
braking hard.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.440
'Look at the pitch,
at the weight moving around.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.440
'Hammerhead.
Managed to hold his line

15:41.440 --> 15:43.320
'but watch the oversteer
on the exit.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.760
'Managing it all the way.
Oh, that was sexy driving!

15:45.760 --> 15:48.880
'All the way over
to the right-hand side now.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.480
'Braking hard into Hammerhead.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.320
'Again, it stops well
but it does look heavy.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.280
'Look at the lean,
a bit of understeer to start.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.400
'Then Stig gets on the throttle,
neutralises it.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.880
'What happens on the exit?
Here we go.

15:57.880 --> 16:01.120
'Oh, that's just showboating.
Super-slick oversteer

16:01.120 --> 16:03.320
'Look at that smoke there,
the diff opening up a bit.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.120
'So maybe the diff's not that tight.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.240
- 'Through the follow-through.
- TYRES SCREECH

16:07.240 --> 16:10.160
'Looks really fast and skilful
through there.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.040
'Bang. That was aggressive.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.280
'Braking hard into second to last.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.920
'What's it like here? It looks
very, very stable to me,

16:18.920 --> 16:20.240
'but doesn't look that grippy.

16:21.320 --> 16:25.040
'Oh! That was using all the track.
And now left into Gambon.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.400
'And over the line.'

16:27.720 --> 16:30.160
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

16:30.160 --> 16:34.520
That looked fast.
That looked fast. OK.

16:35.960 --> 16:42.240
The new Aston Martin DB11 went
around the track in one minute 21.5.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

16:43.320 --> 16:45.120
Right there.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.080
That's ahead of the M3.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.840
But, before you ask,
before you even ask,

16:50.840 --> 16:53.560
we had The Stig take
the S63 around as well.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.440
What do you think?

16:56.440 --> 16:59.120
- It's perfect.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, absolutely.

16:59.120 --> 17:03.880
So the Mercedes AMG S63 did it
in one minute 24 seconds flat.

17:03.880 --> 17:04.920
AUDIENCE GASPS

17:04.920 --> 17:06.760
Ooh!

17:06.760 --> 17:09.200
That goes... there.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.520
Well, it's totally irrelevant.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.640
LAUGHTER

17:12.640 --> 17:14.119
What?

17:14.119 --> 17:18.400
Hold on, hold on. You, Chris Harris,
pro racing driver, car guru,

17:18.400 --> 17:22.400
is going to tell me that, in
the context of comparing two cars,

17:22.400 --> 17:26.839
that the lap time between those
two cars is totally irrelevant?

17:26.839 --> 17:29.160
It's totally irrelevant.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.920
LAUGHTER

17:30.920 --> 17:32.560
This is a comfort game.

17:32.560 --> 17:35.960
This is a comfortable car. I can
sometimes be, you know, rational.

17:35.960 --> 17:38.360
You can also sometimes be
a sore loser.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.040
Rory!

17:40.040 --> 17:42.600
And a bit later on in the show,
I'll be proving

17:42.600 --> 17:46.440
you don't need to spend supercar
money to keep up with supercars.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.160
You just need the right machinery.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.440
- And the right driver.
- Yeah. Not you!

17:50.440 --> 17:52.120
LAUGHTER

17:52.120 --> 17:56.360
All right. Now, it is time
to meet this week's guest.

17:56.360 --> 18:01.400
Stare of Green Wing, Friday Night
Dinner, and Episodes... Great show!

18:01.400 --> 18:03.360
LAUGHTER

18:03.360 --> 18:06.000
Please welcome Tamsin Greig.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.040
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

18:09.640 --> 18:11.000
WHISTLING FROM AUDIENCE

18:11.000 --> 18:12.720
- Wow!
- TAMSIN LAUGHS

18:15.400 --> 18:16.760
Oh!

18:16.760 --> 18:18.480
How are you going?

18:20.240 --> 18:22.440
- All right?
- You're welcome.

18:22.440 --> 18:25.360
How are you?
Oh, so glad to see you.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.520
So glad you're here.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.640
Now, Tamsin and I have been
friends for a long time.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.680
We do the other show together,
obviously.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.160
And, um, we have kissed on camera.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.760
- On camera.
- On camera.

18:34.760 --> 18:38.480
- Uh, I vomited on you on camera.
- Yeah. You did.

18:38.480 --> 18:45.000
- And you kicked and punched me repeatedly on and off camera.
- Yeah.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.120
Yep. But we never have had...

18:48.120 --> 18:50.640
the chat.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.800
- What?
- GENTLE LAUGHTER

18:52.800 --> 18:55.440
The chat. You know.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.000
- What, what?
- The chat.
- What chat?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.520
Tamsin Greig.

18:59.520 --> 19:00.800
SHE GIGGLES

19:00.800 --> 19:03.040
We want to know about
your first one?

19:03.040 --> 19:04.400
Oh.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.000
- Because this is a car show, right?
- Yeah, your first car,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.520
- what did you think I was talking about?
- OK, OK.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.840
SHE WHISTLES WITH RELIEF

19:10.840 --> 19:13.760
- First car, come on.
- My first car.
- Your first car.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.960
Um. Fiat Uno.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.440
AUDIENCE GASPS

19:17.440 --> 19:19.480
Yeah, guys. Right.

19:19.480 --> 19:23.800
And it gave me this kind of
exultant feeling of liberty.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.800
- And I was very, very happy in that car.
- An exultant feeling of liberty?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.920
- Feeling of liberty.
- You don't get a lot of that.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.480
The first poetry ever induced
by a Fiat Uno.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.160
LAUGHTER

19:34.160 --> 19:38.280
But the Fiat Uno became a kind of
like gangster car after that.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.640
- Did it?
- It did. No, no!

19:40.640 --> 19:42.920
- Where? In Chipping Norton!
- LAUGHTER

19:42.920 --> 19:45.120
No, like in Kilburn where I grew up!

19:45.120 --> 19:47.520
Yeah, it became kind of, like,
the souped-up version.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.200
- Oh, the Turbo ie.
- Thank you.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.280
- Is that the one you had?
- No.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.440
I had the basic one
that sounded like a fridge.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.120
LAUGHTER

19:56.120 --> 19:58.200
The door made that
really satisfying noise.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.360
And did things move up
after that car?

20:00.360 --> 20:04.560
After that car,
then I got a Citroen AX which...

20:04.560 --> 20:09.520
- Yeah, guys!
- Nice.
- Aren't you glad you've got me on your show!

20:09.520 --> 20:13.360
- I have a Citroen AX now.
- What, still?
- I still have one.

20:13.360 --> 20:16.320
- How old is it?
- It is 1988.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.280
They were famously unreliable,
though.

20:18.280 --> 20:21.160
- So, did you ever break down in it?
- Yeah, I did.

20:21.160 --> 20:23.320
- SHE LAUGHS
- I did break down once.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.080
There's a tiny little road
that goes over the Lake District

20:26.080 --> 20:28.440
called Wrynose Pass.

20:28.440 --> 20:30.040
And I was on my own and with a dog.

20:30.040 --> 20:33.840
And I thought to myself, this would
be a really bad place to break down.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.400
At which point,
my gear stick came off in my hand,

20:36.400 --> 20:38.400
and this was before mobile phones.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.520
And so I got out of the car
with the dog, at sundown.

20:41.520 --> 20:44.760
So, I'm walking down the mountain
on this little road.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.440
And managed to find a little house.
There was a house there

20:47.440 --> 20:49.560
and there was a couple there
and I used their phone

20:49.560 --> 20:52.840
and phoned the breakdown services
and they found me.

20:52.840 --> 20:57.000
And I said to the AA guy,
are we allowed to say AA?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.720
- Is that advertising?
- Yeah, you can.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.720
Yeah, the man from
Alcoholics Anonymous came...

21:00.720 --> 21:02.240
LAUGHTER

21:02.240 --> 21:04.560
And I said, "It's just so brilliant
to see you,

21:04.560 --> 21:06.760
"I was really, really worried.

21:06.760 --> 21:10.320
"You know, I'm here on my own,
I'm female." I'm female!

21:10.320 --> 21:11.880
"And it could have been
a nightmare."

21:11.880 --> 21:14.040
And the guy, without blinking,
said to me,

21:14.040 --> 21:15.600
"It's not a nightmare.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.840
"It would have been a nightmare
if I'd had a knife.""

21:18.840 --> 21:20.080
LAUGHTER

21:21.360 --> 21:24.160
That's horrid.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.960
That's what the recovering
alcoholic said.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.720
The recovery alcoholic said,
hiding his weapons.

21:29.720 --> 21:33.320
Now, can we stop the horror stories
because that's, frankly, harrowing,

21:33.320 --> 21:36.000
- and talk about Episodes because I'm a big fan.
- Are you?

21:36.000 --> 21:40.760
Now, you've just filmed the last
season. Why does it have to end?

21:40.760 --> 21:43.040
Uh, Tamsin didn't want
to do any more.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.680
- Well, boo to you.
- Ah.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.560
I'm glad we're leaving you
on a high.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.960
- I think it's really good to know when to end stories.
- Yep.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.400
Don't you? It's great to just go,
"We're done, we're done."

21:52.400 --> 21:54.560
Yeah, it did kind of feel
like we've told our story.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.080
- Leave them wanting more.
- Yeah.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.760
OK, we've been trying
to get a clip of this.

21:58.760 --> 22:01.200
It was quite difficult to get
a pre-watershed-friendly clip

22:01.200 --> 22:03.000
- but here we go.
- Oh, yeah.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.760
You want to loosen up.
Don't hunch your shoulders.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.520
Still hunching.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.560
Still hunching.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.880
- Still hunching.
- Those are my shoulders!
- Really?

22:15.600 --> 22:17.680
Now, you want to have both hands
tight on the grip.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.400
- GUNSHOT EXPLODES
- It's loud!

22:19.400 --> 22:21.160
- LOUD GUNSHOTS
- It's loud, it's loud!

22:21.160 --> 22:23.400
It's loud! It's loud!
It's loud!

22:23.400 --> 22:25.360
- Oh... whoa!
- SHE GIBBERS

22:25.360 --> 22:27.440
- Holy crap.
- Well done, darling.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.040
That was no bloody car door.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.120
All right. Just give me the weapon.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.840
I am never doing this again
because it was loud!

22:34.840 --> 22:36.680
- All right, my turn.
- What!

22:36.680 --> 22:38.680
APPLAUSE

22:40.240 --> 22:42.360
TAMSIN LAUGHS

22:43.800 --> 22:45.480
- Well done.
- Thank you.
- Well done.

22:45.480 --> 22:49.920
- Great wrist action.
- Thanks. Did that look like...?

22:49.920 --> 22:52.080
What was that, like, a 357?

22:52.080 --> 22:54.040
- No, no.
- No, no!

22:54.040 --> 22:58.200
- That was a Smith & Wesson 44. That was a big cannon.
- Yes.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.720
I mean, I'd stood there
for a long time.

23:00.720 --> 23:03.120
That's why my arms looked so toned.

23:03.120 --> 23:07.120
Because it was a whole day
I stood there like that.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.440
- OK, I want to show you something very special now.
- OK.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.000
A couple of years ago,
Renault

23:11.000 --> 23:12.960
thought they'd spotted a gap
in the market place,

23:12.960 --> 23:15.200
and they've just created this.
Have a look at this.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.040
- This is delicious.
- WHISTLING FROM AUDIENCE

23:17.040 --> 23:19.520
- The Alpine 110.
- That's nice.

23:19.520 --> 23:22.640
- "Al-peen?".
- "Al-peen." It's a fast Renault.

23:22.640 --> 23:23.920
Not "Al-pine"?

23:23.920 --> 23:26.040
It's an "Al-peen". OK.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.560
Now, the Porsche Cayman
is £40,000 and up.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.920
So Renault thought,
we can offer a cheaper car.

23:30.920 --> 23:35.960
So it's about 250 horsepower,
1,200 kilograms, it's mid-engined.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.440
It's sexy as hell.
Look at that, it's just perfect.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.480
And it's developed
by the guys at Renault Sport.

23:40.480 --> 23:43.760
And they know a thing or two
about making great fast cars.

23:43.760 --> 23:47.400
- Except there's one problem.
- Mm.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.160
It's not cheaper than
a Porsche Cayman, is it?

23:50.160 --> 23:53.600
- It's about £60,000 that thing.
- That is the slight issue.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.600
They identified
the gap in the market,

23:55.600 --> 23:57.480
then they totally missed
the gap in the market!

23:57.480 --> 23:58.720
LAUGHTER

23:58.720 --> 24:02.240
And it's actually more expensive
than a Porsche Cayman.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.800
Yeah.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.720
And it's also named
after a toilet cleaner.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.520
LAUGHTER

24:07.520 --> 24:09.640
Alpine?

24:09.640 --> 24:11.080
- "Al-peen".
- "Al-peen"?

24:11.080 --> 24:13.160
Alpine. It's Alpine Fresh.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.000
Does he look like a man
who buys his own toilet cleaner?

24:17.440 --> 24:18.800
Yeah, he doesn't know!

24:18.800 --> 24:20.560
LAUGHTER

24:20.560 --> 24:22.080
Why can't I buy
my own toilet cleaner?

24:22.080 --> 24:23.720
Do you buy your own toilet cleaner?

24:23.720 --> 24:25.480
Do you go to the shops
and buy toilet cleaner?

24:25.480 --> 24:27.400
Whoa, why's everyone asking me!

24:27.400 --> 24:30.080
Ask him, Rory.
Do it from that side as well.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.720
- Name one brand of toilet cleaner.
- "Al-peen".
- Um...

24:32.720 --> 24:34.520
Fairy Liquid! Fairy Liquid!

24:34.520 --> 24:35.840
LAUGHTER

24:38.000 --> 24:41.280
- The toilet! You wash the...
- With Fairy Liquid.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.680
- You wash your toilet with Fairy Liquid.
- After you do the dishes.
- OK.

24:44.680 --> 24:47.520
- 409. That's in the States.
- That's a car!

24:47.520 --> 24:50.000
The stuff with the funny neck on it
so you can get under the rim,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.040
- I know.
- Duck.
- Duck.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.640
SHE LAUGHS

24:56.640 --> 24:59.480
All right. Time to see
how your training session went

24:59.480 --> 25:06.720
with the loving, caring, kind,
tender, gentle Chris Harris.

25:06.720 --> 25:07.920
Let's take a look.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.480
What's the fastest
you've been in a car?

25:11.480 --> 25:14.960
- Hm, I think about 19mph.
- 19 or 90?

25:14.960 --> 25:17.440
- 90!
- 90, OK.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.920
This could be interesting. Let's go.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.920
- Just be nice, all right?
- AUDIENCE LAUGHS

25:22.920 --> 25:27.840
- No, nothing gets done if you're not nice.
- OK. I'll try.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.640
OK, full power.

25:31.640 --> 25:33.680
- You've got 7,000 revs, use them!
- Talk louder!

25:33.680 --> 25:35.160
Second, third gear now.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.480
- GEARS CRUNCH
- Whoo!

25:36.480 --> 25:38.720
- Ooh, it's in there somewhere.
- Yeah, sorry.
- Fourth gear.

25:38.720 --> 25:41.840
You know the bit on the show
where you have to set the fast lap?

25:41.840 --> 25:44.640
- That's this bit. You're aware of that, aren't you?
- Is this it?

25:44.640 --> 25:45.760
Fourth gear.

25:45.760 --> 25:46.840
Keep going.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.400
- We need a sundial to time this, not a stopwatch.
- Be clear.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.320
Keep going down here.
Down here, straight.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.080
Braking hard now.
Right, right.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.360
- No! Left...
- You said right!

25:55.360 --> 25:58.080
- Just say every bit.
- Oh... Round there, round there, to the right.

25:58.080 --> 26:00.600
This is the famous Hammerhead,
don't get it wrong.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.520
Left, left, left, left.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.000
Right. Right!

26:05.080 --> 26:07.560
Well, that's no bloody good, is it?
What are you...

26:08.920 --> 26:10.560
What are you doing?

26:10.560 --> 26:11.920
Um.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.840
I'm really glad you're here, you've
been very helpful in many ways, um.

26:14.840 --> 26:19.560
But, er, I'm feeling a kind of, um,
a wave of anger coming from you.

26:19.560 --> 26:22.120
And I'm just interested
in what that's all about?

26:23.320 --> 26:25.360
I'm angry because
we're trying to go fast

26:25.360 --> 26:27.520
and you're not going fast yet.
I just want to go fast.

26:27.520 --> 26:28.960
I am going fast.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.440
- Faster than I was.
- You think you're going fast.

26:31.440 --> 26:33.200
You're a teacher.

26:33.200 --> 26:37.360
If you get angry when I can't quite
do what you're asking me to do,

26:37.360 --> 26:41.360
that's going to reflect badly
on you, not on me.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.280
So I think you just
need to calm down.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.480
AUDIENCE LAUGHS

26:44.480 --> 26:48.160
Maybe we can just start
by saying "please"?

26:48.160 --> 26:52.120
- Or... and "thank you".
- Oh, but...

26:52.120 --> 26:55.400
- If I use those pleasantries, will you go faster?
- Yes.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.400
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I will.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.760
Right, are we ready?

26:59.760 --> 27:01.880
- Yep.
- Teach me. Don't point.

27:01.880 --> 27:04.200
- Can we, can we go... Can we please...
- Thank you.

27:04.200 --> 27:07.040
..move the steering wheel
in a rightwards direction.

27:07.040 --> 27:10.040
- Now? Before I'm driving?
- Now, please, before we go. Let's go.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.000
And now accelerate.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.840
And use the throttle.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.720
And to second gear, please.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.560
Thank you.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.960
And to third gear, please,
if you feel like it, thank you.

27:19.960 --> 27:22.200
And now fourth. Thank you.

27:22.200 --> 27:25.640
And over to the left but avoid the
cameraman because that would be bad.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.880
Now, down the end here.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.320
Come on!
Get on...

27:30.320 --> 27:31.640
Please hurry up.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.840
- Where am I going?
- Left. Left, that's good. Over there.

27:34.840 --> 27:38.760
- Maybe just also say where I'm supposed to go.
- OK, OK. OK!

27:38.760 --> 27:40.200
Come on, Tamsin!

27:40.200 --> 27:42.120
I know you've got it in you,
come on!

27:42.120 --> 27:45.120
And, can you please, please brake
between the 100 and the 50.

27:45.120 --> 27:48.200
- Now?
- Brake, brake, brake! Brake.
- Don't shout.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.560
Third, third gear, please.
Left. Left.

27:50.560 --> 27:53.160
I feel like we've been through
something there.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.520
- How do you feel?
- I feel a bit...

27:55.520 --> 27:57.760
- You have improved as a driver.
- Yeah?

27:57.760 --> 28:00.480
And that I have improved
as a human being.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.880
- SHE SIGHS
- Win, win, win.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.520
- Now, get out of the - BLEEP - car

28:04.520 --> 28:07.360
and just think about
how you've been behaving.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.200
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

28:11.400 --> 28:14.600
That was great. You see
what you get? You see what you get?

28:14.600 --> 28:16.560
I can't help it.

28:16.560 --> 28:20.200
- No, she was very, very good. She really was.
- Yeah.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.840
It looked pretty slippery
out there too.

28:21.840 --> 28:25.160
It's the worst conditions that have
ever been experienced on Top Gear.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.480
In three episodes!

28:26.480 --> 28:28.040
LAUGHTER

28:28.040 --> 28:31.200
- No, ever.
- Ever?
- Wasn't it?

28:31.200 --> 28:34.320
I'm not sure I agree with that
but... Sure, what ever you say!

28:34.320 --> 28:36.120
LAUGHTER

28:36.120 --> 28:39.200
I can't wait to see your time,
but we'll do that little bit later.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.480
Now, I want to talk about
ancient history.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.360
The 1970s.

28:44.360 --> 28:46.400
See, 40 years ago,
if you lived in Britain

28:46.400 --> 28:49.920
and wanted a fast car
that wasn't a pain to live with,

28:49.920 --> 28:54.360
you were stuck with something like
this, the Triumph Dolomite Sprint.

28:54.360 --> 28:57.160
Yeah, the '70s kind of sucked.

28:57.160 --> 29:01.640
But one humble hatchback was about
to change all of that forever.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.600
'1977.

29:07.600 --> 29:11.840
'The original Volkswagen Golf GTI
lands in the UK.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.760
'It's mission?

29:13.760 --> 29:18.120
'To prove you can have practicality
and proper performance.'

29:18.120 --> 29:20.200
Mission successful.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.600
The GTI was quicker
than most sports cars.

29:22.600 --> 29:25.520
0 to 60 took barely eight seconds.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.240
By '70s standards,
that was warp speed.

29:29.240 --> 29:33.320
'The GTI was a game-changer
and, in the mid-1980s,

29:33.320 --> 29:36.240
'with the rest of the world
running to catch up,

29:36.240 --> 29:38.760
'VW dropped this.'

29:38.760 --> 29:41.920
The second-generation Golf GTI.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.360
Big bumpers and big attitude.

29:44.360 --> 29:46.480
Damn, this thing's good!

29:46.480 --> 29:49.160
'But then came the 1990s.

29:49.160 --> 29:52.800
'And the GTI became heavier
and uglier.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.440
'The Mk4 was so porky

29:54.440 --> 29:58.800
'it was actually slower to 60
than the '70s original.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.120
'But VW wasn't done yet.'

30:02.200 --> 30:03.960
Arrrgh!

30:03.960 --> 30:05.360
HE LAUGHS

30:05.360 --> 30:06.960
That is more like it.

30:06.960 --> 30:09.200
Yes. The Mk5.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.680
Loads more power, way more nimble,

30:12.680 --> 30:15.200
this was a hot hatch
for the noughties.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.960
And by 2009, with the Mk6,

30:19.960 --> 30:23.800
VW had officially rediscovered
its mojo.

30:25.200 --> 30:27.240
The GTI was back.

30:29.440 --> 30:33.200
And that brings us 40 years
after the original GTI

30:33.200 --> 30:35.640
landed in the UK, to this,

30:35.640 --> 30:39.960
the Volkswagen Golf GTI
Clubsport S.

30:41.640 --> 30:45.040
The most powerful
production Golf ever.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.160
306 horses,

30:51.160 --> 30:56.240
nearly three times as many
as that original GTI from the '70s.

30:56.240 --> 31:00.200
And that's the kind of inflation
I think we can all get behind.

31:02.680 --> 31:08.400
And because it's a proper old school
Golf, all the power heads that way.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.680
By rights, front wheel drive cars
like this should understeer.

31:14.680 --> 31:19.520
But the Clubsport S doesn't,
it just grips and grips and grips.

31:21.040 --> 31:22.320
How is it doing this?!

31:23.320 --> 31:25.160
That just makes no sense.

31:26.600 --> 31:29.080
This is a fast, fast car.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.800
HE SIGHS AND LAUGHS

31:32.760 --> 31:35.720
Yes, yes, yes!

31:38.560 --> 31:41.920
You can almost smell
the engineering quality.

31:41.920 --> 31:47.000
It feels like 40 years of perfecting
the hot hatch formula.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
It feel sophisticated.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.720
It feels expensive.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.840
Which, I'm afraid, it is.

31:55.840 --> 32:00.720
In fact, this Clubsport S model
costs £34,000.

32:00.720 --> 32:04.200
That's nearly three grand more
than a Ford Focus RS,

32:04.200 --> 32:08.360
which has more power,
four-wheel-drive and rear seats.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.080
Did I not mention that?

32:10.080 --> 32:13.160
Well, yeah, as part of
their weight-saving measures,

32:13.160 --> 32:17.880
Volkswagen has chopped out the
rear bench and replaced it with...

32:17.880 --> 32:20.400
a pole and some garden netting.

32:20.400 --> 32:23.120
The rear parcel shelf has also gone.

32:23.120 --> 32:25.360
Along with most of the insulation.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.160
They've even ditched the floor mats.

32:27.160 --> 32:29.640
And there's no armrest!

32:29.640 --> 32:33.680
And guess how much that
crash diet saves?

32:33.680 --> 32:38.160
30 kg. I mean, you can put that
back on after a big kebab.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.200
The Clubsport
has all the performance,

32:43.200 --> 32:45.720
but almost none of the practicality.

32:45.720 --> 32:48.520
It's like it's forgotten what
hot hatches stand for.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.880
I'd argue this isn't really
a hot hatch at all.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.400
So, if it's not a hot hatch,
what is it?

32:58.440 --> 33:00.920
Well, ask Volkswagen
and they'll tell you

33:00.920 --> 33:05.040
it's a two-seater sports car
with an appetite for racetracks.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.080
One racetrack in particular.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.320
The Nurburgring.

33:11.160 --> 33:13.440
The scariest circuit on the planet.

33:14.480 --> 33:20.160
13 miles and 73 corners
of twisting, terrifying tarmac.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.440
And the spiritual home of
the Clubsport S.

33:25.480 --> 33:29.440
This is officially the fastest
front-wheel drive car ever

33:29.440 --> 33:30.720
to lap this track.

33:30.720 --> 33:33.800
It was developed here, tested here.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.760
Every detail has been tweaked

33:35.760 --> 33:38.960
to make this go as fast as possible
out there.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.080
It even has sticky tyres,

33:42.080 --> 33:46.680
fade resistant brakes
and proper functional spoilers.

33:46.680 --> 33:51.240
So, what's this track-ready
Golf really like?

33:51.240 --> 33:55.160
To find out, I've turned up to
a typical German track day

33:55.160 --> 33:59.320
to see if the Clubsport S
can keep up with the locals.

33:59.320 --> 34:02.920
Who, let's face it, seem to
take things pretty seriously.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.560
Yes, getting the very best out of
the Golf in this field

34:07.560 --> 34:10.679
was going to take
some real driving talent.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.280
Right.

34:12.280 --> 34:13.800
Let's do this.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.159
Hi, Rory. Welcome to The Green Hell!

34:16.159 --> 34:18.880
Yeah, why don't you show me around?

34:18.880 --> 34:21.040
For you, I got a special present.

34:21.040 --> 34:24.679
A map of the Nordschliefe, then
you know where we are exactly.

34:24.679 --> 34:28.880
- You think we can keep up?
- Ach, no problem.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.880
With Sabine in confident mood,

34:33.880 --> 34:36.719
we headed out to see
what the Golf was made of.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.440
It's like a little go-kart.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.000
A front-wheel-driven go-kart.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.520
So much power!

34:42.520 --> 34:44.840
OK. OK...

34:44.840 --> 34:48.960
- Ahh, I love the Carousel.
- OK, now I'm scared.

34:48.960 --> 34:51.000
I love it!

34:51.000 --> 34:53.400
THEY BOTH SCREAM

34:55.639 --> 34:58.600
Your name is Rory Reid or
Rory Worried?!

34:58.600 --> 35:01.600
I'm very worried right now!
Oh, my...

35:01.600 --> 35:04.520
'Now, I was keen to really
drill down into the merits

35:04.520 --> 35:06.040
'of the Golf's chassis dynamics...'

35:06.040 --> 35:08.160
- HE WAILS
- Oh, sorry.

35:08.160 --> 35:10.600
'But then Sabine spotted some prey.'

35:10.600 --> 35:12.400
Oh, there are our enemies!

35:13.600 --> 35:16.120
OK. We have some cars up ahead.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.720
So we went hunting.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.720
Come on, little Golf!

35:19.720 --> 35:24.160
- What is it?
- That's a 3 Series BMW. Later!

35:25.680 --> 35:28.960
I wonder how he feels being
overtaken by a Golf?

35:28.960 --> 35:30.640
THEY LAUGH

35:30.640 --> 35:32.680
I think we need another victim.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.760
- I can see a Porsche.
- Porsche!

35:36.760 --> 35:39.120
That looks like... It's a Cayman R.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.120
- A Cayman R?
- Yeah. The quick one.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.840
Nyeeerrrr! Bye-bye, baby.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.520
It's a Cayman GT4!

35:46.520 --> 35:47.880
Whoo!

35:47.880 --> 35:50.200
We're just giant-killing right now.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.960
- I'm going to start writing these down.
- Oh, yeah.

35:54.160 --> 35:55.320
'In the hands of Sabine,

35:55.320 --> 35:57.600
'the Golf wasn't just keeping up
with the locals...'

35:57.600 --> 35:59.480
Loser, loser!

35:59.480 --> 36:01.280
THEY LAUGH

36:01.280 --> 36:02.680
'..it was owning them.'

36:02.680 --> 36:06.240
- Come on, little Golf.
- Coming closer.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.520
Look at this!

36:07.520 --> 36:11.560
- Yeah! Whoo!
- That was a Carrera 4 GTS.
- Yeah?

36:11.560 --> 36:14.960
- That is a £90,000 car.
- Oh, cool!

36:16.600 --> 36:19.200
Which made me wonder,
while we were out here,

36:19.200 --> 36:22.840
could the Golf actually overtake
a million quid's worth?

36:22.840 --> 36:24.640
OK.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.120
Only one way to find out.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.640
Whoohoo! Go, go, go, go!

36:30.640 --> 36:32.680
Come on, come on, come on.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.600
- What's that?
- That is a Corvette, oh, my God.
- A Corvette?

36:36.600 --> 36:38.600
- That's the CL6.
- Seriously?

36:38.600 --> 36:39.960
That's 90 grand.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.480
There's a Golf GTI on your tail!

36:43.480 --> 36:45.200
Bye!

36:46.600 --> 36:48.640
Sabine, I'm trying to write here.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.440
'But Sabine was in the zone.'

36:52.440 --> 36:53.720
SHE LAUGHS

36:53.720 --> 36:55.520
'She was braking later...

36:57.160 --> 36:58.840
'..on the power earlier.'

36:58.840 --> 37:00.520
Whoo!

37:00.520 --> 37:02.880
That's a GT3. They're 100 grand!

37:02.880 --> 37:05.880
The Golf was astonishing.

37:07.560 --> 37:10.520
- Nissan GT-R.
- 80 grand.

37:13.480 --> 37:17.000
- 'Now past the half million pound mark...'
- We need more.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.520
'..Sabine wasn't done yet.'

37:18.520 --> 37:21.080
- Come on, come on, come on.
- What is it?

37:21.080 --> 37:25.360
- That looks like a Porsche 911 Turbo.
- I'll catch you, my friend.

37:27.160 --> 37:28.760
Oh, you are on it, you are on it.

37:28.760 --> 37:30.120
No brakes.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.400
- Yay!
- We're catching him, we're catching him!

37:36.600 --> 37:38.760
Get out of my way!

37:38.760 --> 37:40.240
911 Turbo...

37:40.240 --> 37:41.600
Destroyed!

37:43.280 --> 37:46.520
- How much is it?
- That's 130k.

37:46.520 --> 37:48.840
Whoo! Whoohoo!

37:48.840 --> 37:53.560
With 700 grands' worth of
overtakes now in the bag,

37:53.560 --> 37:56.320
nothing was safe
from our little hatchback.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.400
- What is that?
- That's a Lamborghini.

37:58.400 --> 38:02.280
- A Lamborghini!
- That's a Lamborghini, that's a 570 SuperLeggera!

38:03.480 --> 38:04.840
And I mean nothing.

38:05.880 --> 38:10.200
- Yay, we're coming!
- Oh, my God!

38:10.200 --> 38:11.840
Oh, my God.

38:11.840 --> 38:14.960
'Then, around the next corner...'

38:14.960 --> 38:16.880
- One more, one more.
- Yeah.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.440
It's a 911 GT3 RS!

38:19.440 --> 38:23.720
If you get this, you've done it.
Get him, get him!

38:24.960 --> 38:26.720
Come on, little Golf.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.200
Are we going to get the GT3,
are we going to get him?

38:29.200 --> 38:30.760
Can we overtake him?

38:30.760 --> 38:33.280
- We got him!
- Yeah! We got him!
- We got him!

38:37.280 --> 38:39.840
Have some of that!
Have some of that!

38:41.920 --> 38:44.760
You are not human,
you are not human.

38:44.760 --> 38:46.080
This car...

38:48.440 --> 38:49.960
I love my job.

38:54.520 --> 38:56.760
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

38:59.040 --> 39:00.400
Very nice.

39:02.400 --> 39:05.840
Great driving, Sabine, great
driving. You crushed everything!

39:07.320 --> 39:09.200
Yeah. Even him.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.040
- No, the car was really great.
- Yeah?

39:13.040 --> 39:16.320
Good handling, like a little
go-kart, so I had so much fun.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.600
I think you had
a little bit of fun as well, Rory.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.440
I was having fun up to a point
and then, you know,

39:20.440 --> 39:23.000
my stomach was churning around
a little bit but we got there.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.760
- Not too bad?
- It was touch and go.
- Touch and go?
- Touch and go.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.160
All right. Not that
we don't trust Rory's math,

39:28.160 --> 39:30.320
but we added it all up
back at the office,

39:30.320 --> 39:33.680
and you passed £1.1 million worth
of cars out there.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.600
Way to go!

39:35.600 --> 39:37.200
APPLAUSE

39:38.520 --> 39:39.800
- But...
- Huh?

39:39.800 --> 39:41.040
I must say...

39:42.800 --> 39:44.440
I could have done 2 million,

39:44.440 --> 39:47.520
but I had that heavy, fat oaf
in my passenger seat.

39:47.520 --> 39:50.400
- Whoa!
- I thought we were friends!

39:50.400 --> 39:53.400
Downhill, yes, but uphill... Nyeh!

39:53.400 --> 39:54.600
OK, all right,

39:54.600 --> 39:57.760
can we just take a minute
to appreciate the Clubsport S?

39:57.760 --> 40:00.520
All right?
34 grand is a lot for a hot hatch

40:00.520 --> 40:02.560
but that's cheap for something

40:02.560 --> 40:05.320
that can annihilate
six-figure supercars, OK?

40:05.320 --> 40:08.000
Yeah, if you have a Sabine
driving it.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.080
- This is true.
- If it's you or me driving it,

40:10.080 --> 40:12.520
it's just an expensive Golf
with no back seat.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.040
All right, I take your point.

40:14.040 --> 40:17.080
Sabine, we're going to talk
more about that lap
over on Extra Gear later on, OK?

40:17.080 --> 40:18.640
Yeah, that's right, check it out.

40:18.640 --> 40:20.680
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sabine Schmitz.

40:20.680 --> 40:22.520
CHEERING

40:23.800 --> 40:25.160
Thanks.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.880
So, no pressure, then.

40:28.880 --> 40:32.240
Yeah, what, so,
I have to follow that?

40:32.240 --> 40:34.440
- Is that deliberate?
- Well, yes.

40:34.440 --> 40:35.760
All right, how cool was that?

40:35.760 --> 40:37.840
That was really, really brilliant.

40:39.080 --> 40:42.000
All right, now,
it's dream garage, OK?

40:42.000 --> 40:43.680
You have £100,000 to spend,

40:43.680 --> 40:47.200
you want something exciting
but just a little bit scary.

40:47.200 --> 40:51.200
Something that will get the blood
pumping but not too much, you know?

40:51.200 --> 40:52.720
What do you get?

40:52.720 --> 40:57.360
OK, I could go BAC Mono,
the car that looks like an F1 car.

40:57.360 --> 40:59.600
Superb engine.
Chevy Corvette maybe, Stingray.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.280
What is it with you
and Corvette Stingrays?

41:02.280 --> 41:04.880
- They're amazing.
- Cayman GT4 with shaved down rear tyres

41:04.880 --> 41:06.160
for a bit of slidy-slidy.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.240
Perfect.

41:07.240 --> 41:09.640
Mm-hmm. OK, both good answers.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.960
Both wrong answers.

41:11.960 --> 41:15.880
Because if you want to spend
£100,000 on something exciting

41:15.880 --> 41:18.560
but a bit scary,
you want one of these.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.960
Huh?
LAUGHTER

41:20.960 --> 41:26.000
That is the Bunning Lowlander
Widebody 380 HD.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.760
- That's what you want.
- What the hell is that?

41:28.760 --> 41:31.560
Well, that's a rear-end
muck spreader, obviously.

41:31.560 --> 41:34.480
HD stands for high definition.

41:34.480 --> 41:37.320
- How do you know that?
- Everybody knows that.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.160
I don't know that.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.640
These people all know that.
You know that?

41:41.640 --> 41:43.560
- ALL:
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thanks, cheers.

41:44.680 --> 41:48.160
So that thing just spreads... poo?

41:48.160 --> 41:51.120
Well, yeah, it spreads poo,
but that's not all it spreads.

41:51.120 --> 41:53.200
- Oh, no.
- Want to know what else it spreads?

41:53.200 --> 41:54.560
What else does it spread?

41:54.560 --> 41:55.880
HE CHUCKLES

41:55.880 --> 41:58.160
A melon, a shed and a Volvo.
Check this out.

42:00.400 --> 42:05.120
This is the Bunning
Lowlander Widebody 380 HD.

42:05.120 --> 42:08.000
And it spreads muck. Really well.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.080
Check this out.

42:11.400 --> 42:16.240
OK. I got my trusty assistant with
me today, she's super-confident.

42:16.240 --> 42:19.040
- It's Tamsin Greig.
- Let's rock and roll.

42:21.440 --> 42:22.880
Mind my melons.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.680
I think this is going to be fun,
Tam.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.920
Oh, it's an melon storm. Wow!

42:34.440 --> 42:36.280
SHE LAUGHS

42:36.280 --> 42:37.520
What a mess.

42:38.920 --> 42:40.320
Next is the shed.

42:43.600 --> 42:47.440
OK, Tam, he's all loaded,
that is a shed in the chute.

42:47.440 --> 42:48.920
Let's make some matchsticks.

42:52.520 --> 42:53.960
Oooh!

42:53.960 --> 42:56.400
HE LAUGHS

42:56.400 --> 42:58.560
Are you having fun?

42:59.800 --> 43:01.000
Whoo!

43:01.000 --> 43:04.720
There's still one side of it left,
being a bit stubborn.

43:04.720 --> 43:06.480
OK, Tam, I got the perfect thing

43:06.480 --> 43:08.720
to get rid of that
last piece of wood.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.520
Our scrapped Volvo.

43:13.040 --> 43:16.520
OK, this is the big one, Tam, we're
going to need full power, I think.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.480
HE CHUCKLES

43:26.000 --> 43:27.640
There goes the bonnet.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.120
Oh, the poor Volvo!

43:33.120 --> 43:35.160
I've never seen you so excited!

43:37.760 --> 43:40.200
Oh, there goes the wheel!

43:40.200 --> 43:42.320
HE LAUGHS

43:46.040 --> 43:48.320
There's a lot of legroom
in that car now.

43:58.920 --> 44:04.520
So, there you have it. That is the
Bunning Lowlander Widebody 380 HD.

44:04.520 --> 44:07.280
It spreads stuff.
All over the place!

44:09.160 --> 44:12.000
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

44:14.640 --> 44:16.040
Hold up.

44:16.040 --> 44:17.640
That's a poo spreader.

44:17.640 --> 44:20.720
What kind of animal produces
the kind of poo

44:20.720 --> 44:22.760
that needs a machine like that?

44:22.760 --> 44:24.560
It doesn't matter. Any animal.

44:24.560 --> 44:27.960
It'll spread anything,
anywhere, any time.

44:27.960 --> 44:30.600
- I have never seen you look so happy.
- Yeah, yeah.

44:30.600 --> 44:32.840
I think you enjoyed yourself too
in the big tractor.

44:32.840 --> 44:36.480
That was it, because I was the one
making the things and the things...

44:36.480 --> 44:39.880
But I knew you'd know about
this stuff because you play

44:39.880 --> 44:42.560
a farmer in The Archers, don't you?

44:42.560 --> 44:45.600
I play a farmer on Radio 4's...

44:45.600 --> 44:48.320
You don't know about this because
you never ask me any questions.

44:48.320 --> 44:53.440
- On a programme called The Archers.
- The Archers?
- The Archers.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.800
Is that an archery show,
what is that?

44:57.240 --> 44:58.440
Oh, tell him.

44:58.440 --> 45:01.400
The Archers is a long-running
radio show on Radio 4,

45:01.400 --> 45:03.680
started in 1951, I think?

45:03.680 --> 45:05.560
And it's about a made up place
called Ambridge.

45:05.560 --> 45:08.000
You've been on
a radio show since 1951?

45:08.000 --> 45:09.760
LAUGHTER

45:09.760 --> 45:11.520
- Not that long. '91, yeah.
- That long?

45:11.520 --> 45:14.280
I let them kind of warm it up
for 30 years before I joined it.

45:14.280 --> 45:15.560
How did I not know this?

45:15.560 --> 45:17.560
Because you don't ask me
any questions.

45:17.560 --> 45:19.000
That's right.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.400
So, yeah, I've done a lot of stuff
with muck spreading and, erm,

45:22.400 --> 45:25.960
my character drives a huge combine
harvester

45:25.960 --> 45:27.960
which is kind of
the size of a bungalow.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.240
- Ooh, what kind of combine harvester?
- A big one.

45:30.240 --> 45:31.760
Size of a bungalow.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.680
Is it like an
International Harvester?

45:33.680 --> 45:36.320
Is it a John Deere?
You know what I mean, what is it?

45:36.320 --> 45:38.840
LAUGHTER

45:38.840 --> 45:41.240
It's like a chair in a radio studio.

45:43.400 --> 45:47.320
But I stand on the chair to get
a height differential.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.720
- Why?
- Because then you can hear the difference in height

45:49.720 --> 45:51.920
when I'm up there and someone's
shouting to me...

45:51.920 --> 45:53.680
- So it sounds a tall machine.
- You really do?

45:53.680 --> 45:56.360
- So you record your pieces standing on a chair?
- Yeah.

45:56.360 --> 46:00.600
And shouting down to the person
who's not in the combine harvester.

46:00.600 --> 46:02.920
You should see me
when I'm riding a horse.

46:03.960 --> 46:05.600
All right, now...

46:05.600 --> 46:08.960
it is time to see how you went
around our test track.

46:08.960 --> 46:10.640
- Are you ready? The big moment.
- Yeah, yeah.

46:10.640 --> 46:13.120
- How do you think you did?
- Er, well...

46:14.320 --> 46:16.800
- I was really afraid.
- Great.

46:16.800 --> 46:19.200
- Really afraid. And...
- Great.

46:19.200 --> 46:22.040
And I was most afraid
of the weather.

46:22.040 --> 46:24.600
And being in the car on my own.

46:24.600 --> 46:27.360
- But was it fun? Did you enjoy it?
- I...

46:27.360 --> 46:30.800
It was kind of like, you know when
you've had just too much coffee?

46:30.800 --> 46:33.280
- Yeah.
- And you remember each coffee

46:33.280 --> 46:35.120
but then you're left
with this feeling

46:35.120 --> 46:36.960
- that you don't know what to do with.
- Yeah.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.120
So, if that's enjoyment, then yes.

46:40.720 --> 46:42.720
What do you think?
Do you think she had a good time?

46:42.720 --> 46:44.080
- Definitely not.
- All right.

46:44.080 --> 46:45.480
Well, yeah, shall we take a look?

46:45.480 --> 46:47.360
Yeah, I think before we watch
the lap though,

46:47.360 --> 46:50.080
it needs to be said that
it was really, really slippery.

46:50.080 --> 46:51.520
Almost flooding conditions, so...

46:51.520 --> 46:53.080
Yeah, it was horrendous out there.

46:53.080 --> 46:55.640
- Really bad.
- Just shy of ice.

46:57.040 --> 46:58.920
All right, let's take a look.

46:58.920 --> 47:02.080
OK, here we go.
Tamsin Greig, GT86.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.680
Pretty good off the line.

47:04.760 --> 47:07.280
Slick gear change, up into third.

47:07.280 --> 47:09.720
Don't know if I should change gear.
Should I change gear?

47:09.720 --> 47:11.960
Oh, it's telling me to change gear.
Well, it's too late.

47:13.560 --> 47:15.760
Now, look at this.
Good speed and look how wet it is.

47:15.760 --> 47:18.320
Puddles everywhere. Third gear.

47:18.320 --> 47:20.560
- Not quite on the line.
- GRASS!

47:20.560 --> 47:23.760
That's the grass, there, Tamsin.
You must have...

47:23.760 --> 47:27.600
Yeah, you were a bit scared there,
weren't you? You went on the grass.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.440
Here we go, third gear.
Or are you in second?

47:29.440 --> 47:31.320
I think you're in second there.

47:31.320 --> 47:34.160
I think you're being cautious
is the word, there. Cautious.

47:34.160 --> 47:35.400
- GEARS CRUNCH
- Oh! Sorry.

47:35.400 --> 47:37.520
I will pay for that.
No, Matt will pay for that.

47:37.520 --> 47:39.920
Was that the gearbox again?
Was that the gearbox again?

47:39.920 --> 47:42.200
Third gear down the straight.
Braking hard.

47:42.200 --> 47:46.080
Look how wet it is. I do feel sorry
for you, it was properly wet.

47:46.080 --> 47:47.760
OK.

47:47.760 --> 47:49.440
Come on, get on the power.

47:49.440 --> 47:50.680
Get on the power.

47:50.680 --> 47:53.000
- GEARS CRUNCH
- Sorry.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.720
OK, I'll pay for that one.
Matt will pay for the first.

47:55.720 --> 47:57.320
So, down the back straight.

47:57.320 --> 48:01.240
Oh... Breathe, come on, breathe.

48:01.240 --> 48:04.320
You weren't breathing in training,
weren't you? No, you weren't.

48:04.320 --> 48:06.320
There's the follow-through.
Safely navigated.

48:06.320 --> 48:09.600
Oh, it's really brilliant when you
go fast round corners!

48:11.560 --> 48:12.960
Through the tyres.

48:12.960 --> 48:16.240
You can actually accelerate
round corners!

48:16.240 --> 48:19.280
I've never been able to do that in
north-west London.

48:19.280 --> 48:20.320
Look at your line.

48:20.320 --> 48:22.840
Your line was always really good
into that corner, wasn't it?

48:22.840 --> 48:25.480
- Was it? Was it?
- That's the most unsighted corner on the circuit,

48:25.480 --> 48:27.720
but you always nailed it.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.960
OK. Gambon.

48:30.960 --> 48:32.200
I mean...

48:32.200 --> 48:33.880
- It's not...
- SHE LAUGHS

48:33.880 --> 48:37.000
- It's what I'd call...
- Yeah!
- APPLAUSE

48:37.000 --> 48:38.400
..controlled driving.

48:39.600 --> 48:40.640
Yeah!

48:44.240 --> 48:48.160
- OK, now, considering it was a swimming pool out there...
- Yes.

48:48.160 --> 48:50.160
..are you happy with that?

48:50.160 --> 48:53.240
It looks a lot slower than it felt.

48:53.240 --> 48:55.800
It was like an old lady
going to the shops.

48:57.160 --> 49:00.080
- Chris, how do you think she did?
- I'm confident.

49:00.080 --> 49:03.400
I think we've got a good, solid time
and we've got someone that's alive.

49:03.400 --> 49:06.000
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
OK, are you ready?

49:06.000 --> 49:10.200
Now, the time to beat is still
1:39.5

49:10.200 --> 49:13.360
set by Max Whitlock,
the Olympic demigod.

49:13.360 --> 49:16.000
Have you ever seen his scissor work
on the pommel horse?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.360
- Fantastic. Really, really...
- Calm down!

49:18.360 --> 49:19.920
OK, never mind.

49:19.920 --> 49:22.000
Tamsin Greig...

49:22.000 --> 49:24.240
you went around our track...

49:24.240 --> 49:27.040
- Here we go.
- ..in one minute...
- Yes!

49:27.040 --> 49:29.200
- ..50...
- Yes.

49:29.200 --> 49:31.040
- ..eight...
- Yes.

49:31.040 --> 49:34.240
- ..point seven.
- Yes.
- But, but...
- That's a wet time!

49:34.240 --> 49:37.080
- That's a wet time.
- That is a wet time.
- That's a wet time.

49:37.080 --> 49:38.680
That's a wet time.

49:38.680 --> 49:40.440
You're OK. You're OK.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.240
- Look at that.
- Right there.

49:43.240 --> 49:45.080
APPLAUSE

49:45.080 --> 49:47.680
You're all right, you're OK.
You're OK.

49:47.680 --> 49:50.400
That's the second fastest wet time.

49:50.400 --> 49:51.880
Yeah!

49:51.880 --> 49:55.200
And the last wet time we had was not
nearly that wet, I don't think.

49:55.200 --> 49:56.360
- No, it wasn't.
- It wasn't.

49:56.360 --> 49:58.320
- That's a fantastic job.
- OK, thank you.

49:58.320 --> 50:01.680
Well, listen, we're yeah, you know,
we're alive and, erm,

50:01.680 --> 50:03.800
I haven't brought too much
shame on the family.

50:03.800 --> 50:06.120
- No!
- No shame on the family.
- We all win.

50:06.120 --> 50:08.040
I did really,
really secretly really enjoy it.

50:08.040 --> 50:10.040
You should be proud of
yourself. That was great.

50:10.040 --> 50:12.240
Ladies and gentlemen, Tamsin Greig.
Come on!

50:12.240 --> 50:14.560
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

50:16.640 --> 50:17.720
You did great.

50:17.720 --> 50:19.360
- Fantastic.
- Thanks.

50:19.360 --> 50:21.720
Couldn't have done it without you.

50:21.720 --> 50:23.320
Thank you, well done.

50:24.600 --> 50:27.280
- And you're still alive, so...
- Yeah, I am.
- Good.

50:27.280 --> 50:28.480
Whoo!

50:31.840 --> 50:33.440
OK.

50:33.440 --> 50:35.000
Now I want to talk sports cars.

50:35.000 --> 50:39.120
Not big, intimidating,
fire breathing supercar monsters,

50:39.120 --> 50:42.560
but affordable, adorable,
attainable cars.

50:42.560 --> 50:45.320
Cars with romance, you know?

50:45.320 --> 50:47.920
Now, you think about sports cars
like that and there's only

50:47.920 --> 50:50.560
one place that springs
to mind, right?

50:59.720 --> 51:01.080
Italy.

51:01.080 --> 51:04.680
There's just something
about it, isn't there?

51:04.680 --> 51:09.160
Especially if you're in a classic
Italian sports car like this.

51:10.640 --> 51:12.480
The Fiat 124 Spider.

51:13.560 --> 51:14.840
Bella, huh?

51:21.600 --> 51:27.560
Born in 1966, the 124 Spider
was designed by Pininfarina.

51:27.560 --> 51:30.160
It had a sparkly twin cam engine,

51:30.160 --> 51:33.440
a cutting edge five-speed
manual gearbox

51:33.440 --> 51:36.240
and it weighed about
as much as an actual spider.

51:38.520 --> 51:41.000
And it was bellissima to drive.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.640
Still is.

51:43.640 --> 51:44.920
Still is...

51:53.600 --> 51:57.840
The 124 Spider was so good,
so timeless,

51:57.840 --> 52:00.920
that Fiat kept building it
for nearly two decades.

52:03.520 --> 52:05.080
But that was 30 years ago.

52:06.360 --> 52:08.840
And ever since, fans of simple,

52:08.840 --> 52:13.920
sensibly priced Italian two-seaters
have been left kind of hungry.

52:13.920 --> 52:17.480
But now,
Fiat has a new dish on the menu.

52:22.480 --> 52:25.880
This is the Fiat 124 Spider Abarth.

52:27.760 --> 52:30.360
Classic name, classic recipe.

52:31.840 --> 52:36.080
Small, lightweight,
brilliantly back to basics.

52:41.080 --> 52:43.840
It's stick shift, rear-wheel drive

52:43.840 --> 52:47.400
and the roof is not some
complicated Transformer robot

52:47.400 --> 52:49.240
of metal and motors.

52:49.240 --> 52:53.240
It's just a little scrap of fabric
that you operate using one of these.

52:53.240 --> 52:55.080
Just pop it up...

52:56.880 --> 52:58.160
..and pop it down.

52:58.160 --> 52:59.440
Simple as that.

53:06.840 --> 53:08.760
And when you get it out on the road,

53:08.760 --> 53:11.800
you can really start to appreciate
that beautiful simplicity.

53:16.800 --> 53:19.560
Hello, parmigiana panna cotta.

53:21.480 --> 53:23.480
HE CHUCKLES

53:23.480 --> 53:24.600
Oh, right, the car.

53:26.240 --> 53:30.600
See, this 124 is a throwback
to a less complicated age.

53:34.160 --> 53:37.520
Sure, sometimes you want
a state-of-the-art sports car

53:37.520 --> 53:42.320
with your torque vectoring and your
magnetic adaptive damping

53:42.320 --> 53:45.520
and a double clutch gearbox and...

53:45.520 --> 53:47.800
a Wi-Fi enabled milk frother.

53:50.160 --> 53:53.960
But sometimes, you just want
to keep it simple. Right?

53:57.840 --> 54:00.680
So, after a 30-year absence,

54:00.680 --> 54:04.960
is this finally the genuine Italian
sports car we've been waiting for?

54:17.240 --> 54:18.640
Buongiorno.

54:18.640 --> 54:20.480
Un caffe espresso, si prega?

54:25.640 --> 54:28.200
Well, here's the problem.

54:28.200 --> 54:29.800
I'm not really in Italy.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.160
- Hi, Matt!
- Hey, Matt!

54:31.160 --> 54:32.200
Hiya.

54:34.440 --> 54:38.160
I'm in Los Angeles
and this is a film set.

54:38.160 --> 54:42.680
And this waiter, he's not called
Alessandro or Giuseppe.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.880
- His name is Hunter.
- Hey.

54:46.320 --> 54:47.720
Can you read my film script?

54:47.720 --> 54:48.760
Oh, sure.

54:51.080 --> 54:54.400
And this 124 is not an Italian car.

54:54.400 --> 54:56.920
Sure, it's got
a Fiat badge on it and

54:56.920 --> 55:00.960
a few bits of it come from Italy,
but underneath, this is Japanese.

55:05.040 --> 55:06.960
Specifically, it's one of these.

55:08.240 --> 55:12.800
A Mazda Miata,
or MX-5 as you guys call it.

55:12.800 --> 55:16.040
And while pretty much every car
in the world shares something

55:16.040 --> 55:17.480
with another car...

55:18.680 --> 55:21.760
..these two share
pretty much everything.

55:24.600 --> 55:26.240
Check out the Mazda's cabin.

55:30.560 --> 55:32.560
And now check out the Fiat's cabin.

55:34.600 --> 55:36.160
Mazda.

55:36.160 --> 55:37.800
Fiat.

55:37.800 --> 55:38.880
Mazda.

55:38.880 --> 55:40.600
Fiat.

55:40.600 --> 55:43.080
Wait, hang on. Which is which?

55:44.400 --> 55:47.240
The 124 is even built in Japan

55:47.240 --> 55:50.200
on the same production line
as the MX-5.

56:00.080 --> 56:02.680
Now, if you're going to borrow
from a little sports car,

56:02.680 --> 56:05.920
the MX-5 is definitely where you
want to start.

56:09.520 --> 56:12.080
However, the stuff the Italians
have added...

56:13.520 --> 56:16.240
..seems to have made it... worse.

56:17.640 --> 56:20.560
You see, where the Mazda uses
a naturally aspirated motor,

56:20.560 --> 56:23.760
this 124 uses a turboed motor.

56:27.600 --> 56:29.840
And, yeah,
you get a bit of extra power.

56:29.840 --> 56:32.640
168 horsepower, to be exact.

56:32.640 --> 56:36.320
And this 124 will
do 0-60 in 6.8 seconds

56:36.320 --> 56:39.080
and has a top speed of 144mph.

56:39.080 --> 56:43.120
That's quick enough to leave
that Mazda in its dust.

56:43.120 --> 56:46.720
But, and this may sound picky,
but that's kind of my job...

56:48.120 --> 56:51.960
..these kind of cars are meant to be
all about instant throttle response

56:51.960 --> 56:56.080
and high revs and keeping
you connected to the chassis.

56:56.080 --> 56:58.160
But here,
when you put your foot down,

56:58.160 --> 57:00.880
there's just that little bit
of turbo lag.

57:00.880 --> 57:04.240
That slight hesitation
before things get going.

57:04.240 --> 57:06.840
It's just enough
to break the connection.

57:06.840 --> 57:11.160
It's like trying to tie your
shoelaces with boxing gloves on.

57:11.160 --> 57:12.400
It's a pain in the ass.

57:15.560 --> 57:18.920
So, the Mazda has the Fiat
beaten on feel.

57:18.920 --> 57:22.000
But at least the 124 is cheap,
right?

57:22.000 --> 57:23.400
Well, no.

57:23.400 --> 57:25.800
This one costs nearly 30 grand,

57:25.800 --> 57:28.880
which is almost nine grand more than
the fastest MX-5.

57:30.280 --> 57:31.320
Mamma Mia!

57:39.040 --> 57:41.880
Now, don't get me wrong,
this isn't an awful car.

57:43.560 --> 57:48.040
But this was Fiat's chance
to summon the ghosts of all those

57:48.040 --> 57:52.800
classic Italian sports cars,
to revive that '60s spirit.

57:55.120 --> 57:57.920
And, yeah, it's a fun car to
flick around

57:57.920 --> 58:02.160
on a windy canyon road,
but to call it the 124...

58:03.480 --> 58:04.520
I don't know.

58:04.520 --> 58:08.120
That name feels like it should have
that '60s spirit and this car,

58:08.120 --> 58:09.400
it just doesn't.

58:14.800 --> 58:17.160
It's like, the way it looks...

58:17.160 --> 58:19.360
All 21st-century retro.

58:20.440 --> 58:23.000
It's just a bit fake.

58:24.840 --> 58:27.960
So, if you want a two-seat Italian
sports car that takes you back

58:27.960 --> 58:30.640
to the golden age, and,
come on, who doesn't?

58:31.800 --> 58:35.120
I'm afraid I can't recommend
the Fiat 124.

58:35.120 --> 58:40.120
I can, however, recommend
the Fiat 124.

58:40.120 --> 58:41.520
Seriously.

58:41.520 --> 58:44.840
If you want to live out all those
'60s Italy fantasies,

58:44.840 --> 58:46.680
and I really don't blame
you if you do,

58:46.680 --> 58:50.880
then why not do it in
a car from '60s Italy?

58:50.880 --> 58:51.920
Molto bene.

58:53.880 --> 58:55.800
Buona sera.

58:55.800 --> 58:57.440
Pappida poopida.

58:59.280 --> 59:03.200
♪ On days like these

59:03.200 --> 59:07.040
♪ I wonder what became of you

59:09.360 --> 59:12.680
♪ Maybe today

59:12.680 --> 59:16.080

59:18.960 --> 59:20.880
APPLAUSE

59:22.880 --> 59:24.000
I tried!

59:24.000 --> 59:27.080
I wanted to like it, I really did.
I really wanted to like it.

59:27.080 --> 59:29.400
Yeah, you're right, you're right.
It's a let-down.

59:29.400 --> 59:31.680
I mean, I just can't get on board
with the styling.

59:31.680 --> 59:34.080
To me, it's kind of...
I don't know, droopy.

59:34.080 --> 59:35.240
It's such a disappointment.

59:35.240 --> 59:37.720
And the worst thing is, it doesn't
even feel rear-wheel drive

59:37.720 --> 59:39.200
because it's got so much grip.

59:39.200 --> 59:40.800
Yeah.

59:40.800 --> 59:42.560
This is a beautiful moment.

59:42.560 --> 59:44.240
What? Why?

59:44.240 --> 59:47.880
We agree!
CHEERING

59:47.880 --> 59:50.120
- Right? We all hate it.
- We do.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.920
OK, on next week's show...

59:54.920 --> 59:59.080
I'm the first person ever to review
the Bugatti Chiron.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.040
- AUDIENCE:
- Ooh!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.160
And I'm the first person ever
to review the new

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.880
Ducati 1299 Superleggera.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.240
- AUDIENCE:
- Ooh!

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.040
And they gave me a Renault Twingo.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.160
CHEERING

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.480
It's a big, big show.
We'll see you then.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.200
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
