<i>Richard Cypher,</i>
<i>you are the true Seeker.</i>

00:23.699 --> 00:25.630
If the compass continues
pointing us south,

00:25.631 --> 00:27.298
we'll go right past
the Falls of Aldermont.

00:27.299 --> 00:28.434
Is that someplace important?

00:28.435 --> 00:30.203
It's considered
the most romantic spot

00:30.204 --> 00:31.768
in all the Midlands.

00:31.769 --> 00:35.597
Many a child was conceived
beneath those cascading waters.

00:35.598 --> 00:37.463
I was there once.
It's beautiful.

00:37.464 --> 00:39.125
Oh, really?
And who were you with?

00:39.126 --> 00:40.921
My sister.

00:40.922 --> 00:44.255
At sunset,
when the light hits the falls,

00:44.256 --> 00:46.558
the water glistens red.

00:46.559 --> 00:49.226
They say it's the reflection
of all the lovers' hearts

00:49.227 --> 00:51.291
who've kissed there.

00:51.292 --> 00:53.358
That or a reflection
of the blood spilled

00:53.359 --> 00:54.625
at the Battle of Aldermont.

00:54.626 --> 00:58.191
Two hundred men were
killed in that spot.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.890
The rest threw their bodies
into the rapids

00:59.891 --> 01:01.123
rather than surrender.

01:01.124 --> 01:02.623
Well, that does sound romantic.

01:02.624 --> 01:05.059
( chuckles )
If we move fast,

01:05.060 --> 01:06.593
we can get there
in time to see the sunset.

01:08.662 --> 01:10.595
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

01:18.765 --> 01:21.366
(Cara)
These men were tortured.

01:21.367 --> 01:23.500
Not very inspired work.

01:23.501 --> 01:25.401
(Richard)
Looks like they died
before they hung.

01:25.402 --> 01:27.702
Then why hang them?

01:27.703 --> 01:29.869
Whoever did this wanted
to put them on display

01:29.870 --> 01:32.238
to send a message.

01:32.239 --> 01:34.906
(Zedd)
"Whoever attempts
to subvert justice

01:34.907 --> 01:37.241
shall meet the same fate."

01:37.242 --> 01:38.609
Kahlan, take a look at this.

01:41.612 --> 01:43.145
It's the seal of Aydindril.

01:46.381 --> 01:47.914
"By order
of the High Lord Regent."

01:47.915 --> 01:49.581
Who's that?

01:49.582 --> 01:50.715
There's no such title.

01:50.716 --> 01:52.082
The only person
with the authority

01:52.083 --> 01:55.051
to confer this seal
is the Mother Confessor.

01:55.052 --> 01:57.619
Then who ordered
these men killed?

01:59.154 --> 02:01.088
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

02:03.691 --> 02:05.791
(Man)
I can pay you
15 gold pieces now.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.658
I'll have the rest soon,
I promise.

02:08.660 --> 02:10.461
Please, Lord Regent,

02:10.461 --> 02:11.995
give me a little more time.

02:11.996 --> 02:14.263
You've had more than a month.

02:14.264 --> 02:15.964
It's been difficult
for me to find work

02:15.965 --> 02:16.964
since you cut off my hand.

02:16.965 --> 02:18.165
Your hand was removed

02:18.166 --> 02:19.966
as punishment
for stealing grain.

02:19.967 --> 02:21.200
Times were hard after the war.

02:21.201 --> 02:22.334
My family needed food.

02:22.335 --> 02:24.235
You were tried fairly
and found guilty.

02:24.236 --> 02:26.070
In accordance with the law,
you lost your hand.

02:26.071 --> 02:28.137
Wasn't that punishment enough?

02:28.138 --> 02:30.472
For theft?

02:30.473 --> 02:31.772
But to steal that grain,

02:31.773 --> 02:35.008
you also trespassed
on Olrich Larson's land.

02:35.009 --> 02:36.742
Should that crime
simply go unpunished?

02:36.743 --> 02:38.710
If the Council and the Mother
Confessor were here,

02:38.711 --> 02:39.710
they would never allow--

02:39.711 --> 02:42.178
But they aren't here, are they?

02:43.480 --> 02:44.813
Please.

02:44.814 --> 02:46.581
Have mercy...

02:46.582 --> 02:47.915
( scoffs )

02:47.916 --> 02:49.249
I'm showing you mercy, Shaun.

02:49.250 --> 02:52.018
Fifty gold pieces
and you can go home.

02:52.019 --> 02:53.519
I don't have it.

02:53.520 --> 02:57.255
Please don't take my other hand.

02:57.256 --> 02:59.323
Oh, I'm not going
to take your other hand.

03:02.192 --> 03:05.360
Tomorrow at dawn,
cut off his head.

03:05.361 --> 03:08.429
No! No!

03:08.430 --> 03:10.130
No, please don't kill me! No!

03:10.131 --> 03:12.198
No!

03:12.199 --> 03:14.799
My family will starve!
Don't do this!

03:14.800 --> 03:16.434
You see why I asked you to come.

03:16.435 --> 03:19.669
I only wish I could
have gotten here sooner.

03:19.670 --> 03:22.471
Fyren's army
is occupying the city.

03:22.472 --> 03:24.039
The people are afraid
to oppose him.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.408
Even a Wizard of the Second
Order might find himself

03:27.409 --> 03:28.642
swinging from a noose

03:28.643 --> 03:30.944
if he tried to use
magic to stop him.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.011
I need your help.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.880
What about Oloron's Amulet?

03:34.881 --> 03:36.481
Fyren has it locked
in the treasury

03:36.482 --> 03:39.016
with a dozen men guarding it.

03:39.017 --> 03:40.984
I'll get it.
(Fyren) The next prisoner.

03:40.985 --> 03:44.620
There are not many Wizards
left in this world, Silas.

03:44.621 --> 03:46.955
Going in there would--
Would be tantamount

03:46.956 --> 03:48.522
to signing your own
death warrant.

03:48.523 --> 03:51.424
And how many more
death warrants will be signed

03:51.425 --> 03:54.926
if we don't bring the Mother
Confessor back to Aydindril?

03:57.463 --> 04:00.230
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

04:00.231 --> 04:02.165
( chatter )

04:03.633 --> 04:05.834
Halt, Wizard.

04:05.835 --> 04:06.968
Halt or I'll shoot.

04:06.969 --> 04:09.803
( chanting in ancient tongue )

04:26.247 --> 04:29.515
(Cara)
Richard, those bodies we found
were at least two days old.

04:29.516 --> 04:33.385
Whoever killed those
men is long gone.

04:33.386 --> 04:35.154
( rumbling )

04:47.866 --> 04:49.700
Silas.
You know him?

04:49.701 --> 04:52.837
He's a Wizard of the Second
Order from Aydindril.

04:52.838 --> 04:54.305
Cara.

04:59.044 --> 05:00.211
(Cara)
He's already cold.

05:00.212 --> 05:02.779
The Breath of Life
won't work.

05:02.780 --> 05:05.181
You can put your weapons down.

05:05.182 --> 05:06.848
Whoever shot him
couldn't follow him here.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.750
He used this.

05:08.751 --> 05:10.685
Oloron's Amulet.

05:10.686 --> 05:13.053
What is it?

05:13.054 --> 05:14.721
A magical device
that's kept in Aydindril.

05:14.722 --> 05:18.892
It was devised hundreds
of years ago as a safeguard.

05:18.893 --> 05:22.027
If the Mother Confessor
were urgently needed,

05:22.028 --> 05:23.528
a skilled Wizard
could use the amulet

05:23.529 --> 05:25.263
to find her anywhere
in the world

05:25.264 --> 05:27.899
and carry them both home.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.835
He must have been
shot in Aydindril.

05:30.836 --> 05:33.003
It seems he managed
to recite the incantation

05:33.004 --> 05:34.571
just before he died.

05:34.572 --> 05:36.872
He came here
to tell you something.

05:36.873 --> 05:39.074
It must have been important.

05:39.075 --> 05:42.076
My guess is
it has something to do

05:42.077 --> 05:44.712
with this "High Lord Regent"
who ordered those men killed.

05:44.713 --> 05:46.913
I have to get to Aydindril.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.749
That's hundreds
of leagues from here.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.485
Zedd, can you use that amulet
to get us there?

05:52.486 --> 05:54.653
Its magic is only strong enough

05:54.654 --> 05:56.821
to transport a Wizard
and a Confessor.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.025
Then we'll meet
up with you there.

06:02.026 --> 06:03.393
(Zedd)
That could take weeks.

06:03.394 --> 06:06.562
Every day the quest is delayed,
the Keeper grows stronger.

06:06.563 --> 06:10.932
You and Cara continue the search
for the Stone of Tears

06:10.933 --> 06:12.834
while Kahlan
and I go to Aydindril.

06:12.835 --> 06:16.970
The Seeker needs his Wizard
and his Confessor by his side.

06:16.971 --> 06:18.605
If we leave him again--

06:18.606 --> 06:20.307
After we killed Darken Rahl,

06:20.308 --> 06:22.909
you should have gone
back to Aydindril then,

06:22.910 --> 06:24.510
but instead,
you came with me.

06:24.511 --> 06:26.679
The quest was more important.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.581
The quest is my burden.

06:28.582 --> 06:31.917
I've kept you away from
your home long enough.

06:34.820 --> 06:37.288
My home is with you.

06:37.289 --> 06:39.923
We've been apart before.

06:39.924 --> 06:42.559
We always find our way
back to each other.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.494
( <i>soft theme playing</i> )

06:49.599 --> 06:51.567
( Zedd chanting
in ancient tongue )

06:54.037 --> 06:55.904
I wish I didn't have to go.

06:58.307 --> 06:59.840
( rumbling )

07:07.081 --> 07:09.049
Kahlan?

07:11.152 --> 07:13.720
What--? What happened?

07:13.721 --> 07:15.054
Why am I still here?

07:16.423 --> 07:18.390
And where's Zedd?

07:25.564 --> 07:27.465
How do you feel?

07:27.466 --> 07:29.233
All in one piece.

07:29.234 --> 07:32.736
I wish I could say
the same for the amulet.

07:32.737 --> 07:35.471
At least it got
us here safely.

07:39.343 --> 07:41.910
It's good to be home.

07:46.356 --> 07:47.724
If Zedd got to Aydindril

07:47.725 --> 07:49.325
and realized I wasn't with him,

07:49.326 --> 07:51.361
he'd come back for me.
(Richard) Maybe he can't.

07:51.362 --> 07:53.395
I have a feeling
Zedd got to Aydindril

07:53.396 --> 07:55.563
with the other half of this.

07:55.564 --> 07:57.698
Even if he did get there,
look at what happened to Silas.

07:57.699 --> 07:59.901
Zedd could be walking
into a trap.

07:59.902 --> 08:01.802
The Wizard isn't
exactly defenseless.

08:03.972 --> 08:07.274
If I can get a horse I can
be there in less than a week.

08:07.275 --> 08:08.709
You can't go alone.

08:08.710 --> 08:09.776
It's too dangerous.

08:09.777 --> 08:11.877
Cara and I will go with you.

08:11.878 --> 08:14.011
But the compass is pointing
in the opposite direction.

08:14.012 --> 08:18.081
And we'll follow it that way
once we know Zedd is safe.

08:18.082 --> 08:19.449
Let's go.

08:21.952 --> 08:25.120
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

08:25.121 --> 08:26.688
Silas knew that
stealing the amulet

08:26.689 --> 08:28.256
could cost him his life.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.925
It's a rare man willing
to make such a sacrifice.

08:33.094 --> 08:34.395
( speaking inaudibly )

08:34.395 --> 08:35.796
Who are those guards?

08:35.797 --> 08:37.130
Prince Fyren's men.

08:37.131 --> 08:39.465
Prince Fyren?

08:39.466 --> 08:40.466
Of Kelton?

08:40.467 --> 08:41.801
When Rahl fell,

08:41.802 --> 08:44.903
Fyren threw the D'Harans
out of Kelton and Aydindril.

08:44.904 --> 08:47.538
Then he jailed
the Council members

08:47.539 --> 08:50.540
and proclaimed himself
"High Lord Regent."

08:50.541 --> 08:53.042
In a forest near Gallimar,

08:53.043 --> 08:55.144
we found two bodies
hanging from a tree

08:55.145 --> 08:57.079
bearing the seal of Aydindril
round their necks.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.581
Fyren's work.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.115
He's given bands of hoodlums

09:01.116 --> 09:03.116
the authority
to enforce his laws,

09:03.117 --> 09:06.886
mostly archaic or invented,
demanding fines.

09:06.887 --> 09:11.256
When people can't pay, or won't,
he makes examples out of them.

09:11.257 --> 09:13.258
I've heard enough.

09:13.259 --> 09:15.793
Where can I find Prince Fyren?

09:23.133 --> 09:25.467
Well.

09:25.468 --> 09:28.136
What crime could
this lovely young lady

09:28.137 --> 09:29.970
possibly have committed?

09:29.971 --> 09:33.407
It's a private matter.

09:33.408 --> 09:36.677
Come closer.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.816
Tell me what I can
do for you.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.751
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

09:48.920 --> 09:50.987
You can get out of my chair.

09:59.662 --> 10:02.798
Command me, Confessor.

10:02.799 --> 10:04.165
Order your men to stand down.

10:04.166 --> 10:07.067
Death to anyone who harms her!

10:12.139 --> 10:15.341
The Mother Confessor
has returned to Aydindril.

10:15.342 --> 10:18.777
Everyone answers to me

10:18.778 --> 10:22.380
or you will meet the same
fate as Prince Fyren.

10:24.316 --> 10:28.517
All of his edicts will
be subject to my review.

10:28.518 --> 10:33.555
There will be no more unjust
fines or executions.

10:33.556 --> 10:37.358
The rule of law will be restored
to the Midlands.

10:37.359 --> 10:39.059
( applause )

10:44.132 --> 10:46.133
What are you smiling about?

10:46.134 --> 10:49.703
Nothing. I was just thinking.
About what?

10:49.704 --> 10:53.372
Even though I'm worried
about Zedd, I have to admit,

10:53.373 --> 10:57.009
part of me is glad
the amulet didn't work.

10:57.010 --> 10:59.644
I always dreamed we'd
go to Aydindril together.

10:59.645 --> 11:02.579
( woman screams )

11:05.249 --> 11:06.582
Please, we won't do it again.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.350
You've violated
the code of Aydindril.

11:08.351 --> 11:10.985
If you don't pay your fine,
you'll be put to death.

11:10.986 --> 11:12.986
For kissing her?

11:12.987 --> 11:14.421
(Richard)
Let them go.

11:16.256 --> 11:18.223
This is none of your concern,
Seeker.

11:18.224 --> 11:19.858
We're here under the authority

11:19.859 --> 11:22.092
of the High Lord Regent
of Aydindril.

11:22.093 --> 11:24.161
Release them. Now.

11:24.162 --> 11:26.096
Or what?

11:29.867 --> 11:32.268
Get out of here!

11:32.269 --> 11:34.770
( all grunting )

11:34.771 --> 11:36.705
( <i>action theme playing</i> )

11:51.688 --> 11:53.056
( Agiel whining )

12:01.264 --> 12:02.532
( gasping )

12:09.398 --> 12:11.767
You're no Confessor.

12:12.602 --> 12:14.502
( grunts )

12:17.574 --> 12:19.207
( panting )

12:19.208 --> 12:21.742
What happened?
Why didn't you confess him?

12:21.743 --> 12:23.310
I couldn't.

12:23.311 --> 12:24.545
What?

12:24.546 --> 12:27.512
My power...

12:27.513 --> 12:29.681
it's gone.

12:41.299 --> 12:44.200
I knew I wasn't feeling right.

12:44.201 --> 12:46.535
Now I know why.

12:46.536 --> 12:49.838
It must have been the accident
with the amulet.

12:49.839 --> 12:53.508
Richard, this has never
happened before.

12:53.509 --> 12:54.843
To any Confessor. Ever.

12:54.844 --> 12:57.145
There has to be a way
to fix it.

12:57.146 --> 12:59.814
Confessor magic isn't something
you can just "fix."

12:59.815 --> 13:02.883
Without it I'm--
I'm not a Confessor at all.

13:02.884 --> 13:04.217
Hey.

13:04.218 --> 13:07.620
We'll get to Aydindril,
we'll find Zedd--

13:07.621 --> 13:10.222
We don't even know
if Zedd's alive.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.858
It takes more magic than
a broken amulet to kill Zedd.

13:12.859 --> 13:15.393
Trust me.

13:15.394 --> 13:17.895
I asked our friends if we
could borrow their horses.

13:21.566 --> 13:22.900
They didn't object.

13:25.368 --> 13:28.803
The faster we move, the sooner
we can get back to Zedd.

13:28.804 --> 13:31.038
Come on.

13:34.575 --> 13:37.177
Hyah!

13:37.178 --> 13:39.714
( horse whinnies )

13:41.317 --> 13:43.285
The sentence issued
by Prince Fyren

13:43.286 --> 13:45.520
was unduly harsh.

13:45.521 --> 13:47.655
His order for your beheading
is hereby overturned.

13:47.656 --> 13:50.724
Bless you, Mother Confessor.

13:52.393 --> 13:54.861
Kahlan, I believe
we can do more

13:54.862 --> 13:56.296
to mitigate this man's loss.

13:58.532 --> 14:00.098
Just a moment, Zedd.

14:00.099 --> 14:03.667
His hand was removed
because he stole grain.

14:03.668 --> 14:06.169
I had to.
To feed my family.

14:06.170 --> 14:09.105
But you stole that grain
from another family.

14:10.507 --> 14:12.908
Yes, Mother Confessor.

14:12.909 --> 14:14.976
Then according
to the code of Aydindril,

14:14.977 --> 14:16.944
cutting off your hand
was the fitting punishment.

14:16.945 --> 14:19.311
I'm afraid I can't let
the Wizard restore it.

14:21.180 --> 14:22.514
Kahlan, are you sure?

14:22.515 --> 14:24.949
I've made my decision.

14:31.789 --> 14:34.957
She's changed since
I last saw her.

14:34.958 --> 14:38.165
She's changed
since this morning.

14:41.405 --> 14:43.806
My men have returned nearly
all the fines I collected.

14:43.807 --> 14:45.441
They have orders not to stop

14:45.442 --> 14:46.975
until they've
paid everyone back.

14:46.976 --> 14:48.777
Have I pleased you, mistress?

14:48.778 --> 14:50.545
For now.

14:50.546 --> 14:53.115
See to it that all the released
prisoners get home safely.

14:53.116 --> 14:55.283
Yes, mistress.

14:55.284 --> 14:57.120
Zedd.

14:57.121 --> 14:59.155
I thought you'd be
feasting on lamb

14:59.156 --> 15:00.823
at Ambrosio's Tavern by now.

15:00.824 --> 15:02.525
And miss watching
the Mother Confessor

15:02.526 --> 15:04.660
bring justice
back to Aydindril?

15:04.661 --> 15:07.296
Not even for Ambrosio's.

15:07.297 --> 15:11.000
There's still so much
to set right.

15:11.001 --> 15:12.667
Why didn't you allow me

15:12.668 --> 15:13.999
to restore that
young man's hand?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.734
He stole grain
from another family.

15:16.735 --> 15:20.003
With his hand he could
have worked to repay them.

15:20.004 --> 15:21.505
According to the code
of Aydindril--

15:21.506 --> 15:23.674
You know better than I do
that those barbaric codes

15:23.675 --> 15:25.509
haven't been enforced
for hundreds of years.

15:25.510 --> 15:29.147
Yes, and look
at the Midlands now.

15:31.584 --> 15:33.551
Zedd, I did not come here
to grant amnesty

15:33.552 --> 15:35.720
to thieves and petty criminals.

15:35.721 --> 15:38.423
I came here to abolish
a corrupt system.

15:38.424 --> 15:41.026
To bring back the rule of law.
If I start making exceptions

15:41.027 --> 15:43.628
the rules will lose
their meaning.

15:43.629 --> 15:46.997
In the past, you've always been
one to err on the side of mercy.

15:46.998 --> 15:49.932
What you call "mercy"
is a stone's throw from chaos.

15:51.801 --> 15:54.870
Do you think
I'm being unreasonable?

15:54.871 --> 15:58.607
Not unreasonable,

15:58.608 --> 16:00.375
just very different

16:00.376 --> 16:02.343
from the Kahlan Amnell I know.

16:02.344 --> 16:05.079
Before, my duty
was to protect Richard.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.380
Here, I'm the leader.

16:06.381 --> 16:08.315
I have to have
the people's respect.

16:08.316 --> 16:10.383
I hope I have yours.

16:10.384 --> 16:12.886
Always, Kahlan.

16:14.822 --> 16:16.222
Thank you.

16:20.126 --> 16:22.460
( crickets chirping )

16:32.300 --> 16:36.335
Richard, Richard.

16:36.336 --> 16:39.004
What's wrong?
You all right?

16:39.005 --> 16:41.473
Oh, yeah, I'm fine,
everything's fine.

16:41.474 --> 16:42.574
I just--

16:44.476 --> 16:46.744
I need to talk to you.

16:49.180 --> 16:50.313
Alone.

16:53.717 --> 16:57.252
We're going to take a walk.

17:02.991 --> 17:05.992
I couldn't sleep.

17:05.993 --> 17:08.862
I kept thinking:
I don't have my powers--

17:08.863 --> 17:11.198
I know, but--
No, no.

17:11.199 --> 17:13.733
No, Richard,
it's not that, I--

17:13.734 --> 17:15.667
( <i>soft theme playing</i> )

17:22.273 --> 17:24.943
I don't know if I'm going to get
them back tomorrow or ever.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.278
But right now...

17:29.481 --> 17:31.849
This--

17:31.850 --> 17:34.785
This could
be our only chance.

17:37.655 --> 17:38.754
Are you saying--?

17:38.755 --> 17:40.288
Yes.

17:43.593 --> 17:45.761
If you want to.

18:01.077 --> 18:03.045
( knocks )

18:03.046 --> 18:05.848
You asked to see me, mistress?

18:10.720 --> 18:13.255
Before you were confessed,

18:13.256 --> 18:16.825
your motives were greedy
and selfish,

18:16.826 --> 18:18.260
and your methods unlawful.

18:18.261 --> 18:20.128
Forgive me, mistress.

18:20.129 --> 18:22.263
( latch clanks )

18:22.264 --> 18:26.901
However, you also showed great
strength and leadership.

18:26.902 --> 18:29.470
You took the D'Harans
out of Aydindril.

18:29.471 --> 18:33.940
You easily unseated
the Council.

18:33.941 --> 18:38.077
You come from a line of kings
and great warriors.

18:38.078 --> 18:42.180
You meet the qualifications
to sire the next Confessor.

18:43.616 --> 18:46.183
Mistress, I'm honored.

18:47.485 --> 18:50.087
I'll please you in ways
you can't imagine.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.455
Hm. I doubt that.

18:51.456 --> 18:53.156
But you can try.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.758
Oh, that won't be necessary.

18:56.759 --> 18:58.925
Just take off your clothes.

19:00.859 --> 19:02.792
( <i>soft upbeat theme playing</i> )

20:09.598 --> 20:11.031
The sun's coming up.

20:11.032 --> 20:12.165
Are you sure?

20:12.166 --> 20:14.867
I think that's the moon.

20:14.868 --> 20:16.668
Cara's going to be wondering
where we are.

20:16.669 --> 20:20.270
I think Cara
can figure it out.

20:26.808 --> 20:30.846
Can you imagine what it would
be like to be ordinary people?

20:30.847 --> 20:35.086
You mean the kind that sleep
in beds in houses?

20:35.087 --> 20:37.554
Yes, yes.

20:37.555 --> 20:40.723
And who make each other
breakfast in the morning

20:40.724 --> 20:42.657
and kiss their
children goodnight.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.492
The kind that have time

20:44.493 --> 20:47.863
to go see the Falls of Aldermont
at sunset.

20:47.864 --> 20:51.170
Do you ever think about that?

20:51.171 --> 20:53.639
Every day.

20:59.212 --> 21:01.813
I wish we didn't
have to go.

21:01.814 --> 21:05.483
Me too.

21:05.484 --> 21:08.252
( chuckles )

21:12.557 --> 21:14.324
I'll meet you back
at the campsite.

21:19.432 --> 21:21.266
( sighs )

21:23.436 --> 21:24.536
This is Aydindril.

21:24.537 --> 21:26.239
If we go through
the Rang'Shada mountains

21:26.240 --> 21:27.873
we won't have to cross
the Kael river.

21:27.874 --> 21:30.008
There's a bridge
after the river forks.

21:30.009 --> 21:31.576
It might be faster.

21:31.577 --> 21:33.177
We'll go that way, then.

21:37.650 --> 21:41.485
That was a long walk
you took.

21:43.922 --> 21:46.191
What are you two doing?

21:46.192 --> 21:49.328
We're just discussing whether
to go through the mountains

21:49.329 --> 21:50.396
or across the river.

21:50.397 --> 21:52.598
You had your hands all over him.

21:54.168 --> 21:55.936
I was taking a leaf
out of his hair.

21:55.937 --> 21:59.473
I may not have my powers,
but I have eyes, Cara.

21:59.474 --> 22:00.941
I know what I saw.

22:00.942 --> 22:03.978
You can't stand that Richard
and I were together last night.

22:03.979 --> 22:05.380
Why would I care?

22:05.381 --> 22:07.015
Do you think I don't see
how you look at him?

22:07.016 --> 22:08.783
"I'd die for you, Richard."

22:08.784 --> 22:11.919
"How can I serve you,
Richard?"

22:11.920 --> 22:14.889
You want him for yourself.
You always have, just admit it.

22:14.890 --> 22:17.425
Kahlan, you are seeing things
that aren't there.

22:17.426 --> 22:20.061
Richard,

22:20.062 --> 22:23.230
she has been trying
to get her claws into you

22:23.231 --> 22:25.401
ever since you rescued her
from the Mord-Sith.

22:25.402 --> 22:28.005
No one rescued me.

22:28.006 --> 22:29.540
Cara--

22:29.541 --> 22:31.641
You think if it weren't for me,
you'd have him already?

22:31.642 --> 22:33.374
Well, you will never
have him.

22:33.375 --> 22:36.472
If I wanted him,
I would have had him already.

22:36.473 --> 22:37.837
(Richard)
Kahlan.

22:37.838 --> 22:40.339
You're not thinking.

22:40.340 --> 22:41.473
Cara hasn't done anything--

22:41.474 --> 22:43.241
Why do you always
defend her?

22:43.242 --> 22:44.242
Just calm down.

22:44.243 --> 22:46.810
( gasps )

22:46.811 --> 22:49.011
You love her, don't you?

22:49.012 --> 22:51.647
Kahlan--
All right. Fine.

22:51.648 --> 22:53.415
If you want her,
you can have her.

22:53.416 --> 22:57.152
I hope you two
are very happy together.

23:05.826 --> 23:07.961
(Richard)
Kahlan, stop.

23:07.962 --> 23:10.229
Kahlan.

23:10.230 --> 23:11.330
( sighs )
I'm sorry.

23:11.331 --> 23:13.699
I don't know
what I was thinking.

23:13.700 --> 23:15.801
I don't know why I said
those things to Cara.

23:15.802 --> 23:17.302
Cara's fine.

23:17.303 --> 23:19.270
Look, what is this about?

23:19.271 --> 23:21.138
I just...

23:21.139 --> 23:25.409
I saw her with you
and I was afraid that--

23:25.410 --> 23:27.877
That last night meant nothing
to you.

23:27.878 --> 23:30.246
It meant everything to me.

23:30.247 --> 23:32.147
But you want to go
to Aydindril.

23:32.148 --> 23:34.482
You want me to get
my powers back.

23:34.483 --> 23:36.283
Then we'll never
be able to--

23:36.284 --> 23:38.185
I want you to get
your powers back

23:38.186 --> 23:40.623
because they're a part of you.

23:40.624 --> 23:42.858
I thought that's what
you wanted too.

23:42.859 --> 23:47.329
But whatever happens,
you are the one I love.

23:47.330 --> 23:50.298
When the rift is sealed
and the world is safe again,

23:50.299 --> 23:53.201
I want nothing more
than just to be with you.

23:55.170 --> 23:57.838
We could be together now.

23:57.839 --> 23:59.506
What are you talking about?

23:59.507 --> 24:01.374
Richard, the Prophecy says

24:01.375 --> 24:03.543
that as long as the Mother
Confessor's pure heart beats,

24:03.544 --> 24:05.479
the Keeper will never win.

24:05.480 --> 24:07.514
All I have to do
is stay alive.

24:07.515 --> 24:10.984
We could go into hiding
somewhere where I'd be safe

24:10.985 --> 24:12.853
and we can give
the Sword to Cara,

24:12.854 --> 24:14.722
and she could go to Aydindril
and give it to Zedd.

24:14.723 --> 24:16.523
And they can name
a new Seeker.

24:16.524 --> 24:18.992
And we can live
like ordinary people.

24:18.993 --> 24:21.194
We could-- We could
have children.

24:21.195 --> 24:25.465
Kahlan, I can't abandon
my quest.

24:29.536 --> 24:32.472
Does that always
have to come first?

24:32.473 --> 24:35.374
Before our happiness?

24:35.375 --> 24:38.945
The Kahlan I know cares more
about the fate of the world

24:38.946 --> 24:40.246
than her own happiness.

24:40.247 --> 24:43.716
Well, maybe it's our turn.

24:43.717 --> 24:46.386
We can both have
what we want.

24:46.387 --> 24:47.987
Listen to me.

24:47.988 --> 24:49.789
Something is wrong with you.

24:49.790 --> 24:52.392
You didn't just lose
your powers, you lost...

24:52.393 --> 24:53.594
something else.

24:53.595 --> 24:55.929
No, Richard, I'm fine.
You're not fine.

24:55.930 --> 24:58.729
You're making accusations
that don't make sense.

24:58.730 --> 25:00.497
You're talking about
abandoning our quest.

25:00.498 --> 25:04.134
Richard, I just--
I love you so much.

25:04.135 --> 25:06.402
I can't lose you.
I can't. I can't.

25:06.403 --> 25:10.139
You're not
going to lose me.

25:10.140 --> 25:12.741
And if you love me,
you need to trust me.

25:12.742 --> 25:15.243
I don't know what's happened
to you, but we need to find out.

25:15.244 --> 25:17.311
Do you trust me?

25:17.312 --> 25:21.448
Then we need to get to Aydindril
and get there fast.

25:21.449 --> 25:23.382
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

25:27.822 --> 25:29.756
Havre the Council brought to me
when they arrive.

25:29.757 --> 25:31.224
Kahlan.

25:31.225 --> 25:34.657
May I have a word?

25:34.658 --> 25:37.393
Leave us, Fyren.

25:37.394 --> 25:38.961
I take it you finally
made it

25:38.962 --> 25:40.563
to Ambrosio's last night?

25:40.564 --> 25:44.332
Yes, and I heard
a rather disturbing rumor

25:44.333 --> 25:47.901
that the Mother Confessor had
taken Prince Fyren as her mate.

25:47.902 --> 25:50.736
I assured those gossiping fools
that there was no truth to it,

25:50.737 --> 25:53.571
but his appearance
by your side

25:53.572 --> 25:54.905
might give some
the impression--

25:54.906 --> 25:56.239
It's no rumor, Zedd.

25:58.942 --> 26:00.809
Kahlan,
you couldn't have.

26:02.745 --> 26:04.245
He's been confessed.

26:04.246 --> 26:06.080
He meets the requirements.

26:06.081 --> 26:07.615
But what about Richard?

26:07.616 --> 26:09.783
You know I can't mate
with Richard.

26:09.784 --> 26:11.251
My powers
would destroy him.

26:11.252 --> 26:13.520
Of course, but you've always
resisted taking a mate

26:13.521 --> 26:15.354
because of your love
for him.

26:17.690 --> 26:19.157
I don't have the luxury
of love.

26:20.525 --> 26:24.193
I have a duty to continue
the line of Confessors.

26:24.194 --> 26:26.528
Richard understands that.

26:26.529 --> 26:27.996
So should you.

26:27.997 --> 26:30.165
I understand that,

26:30.166 --> 26:32.035
but to do it
so rashly,

26:32.036 --> 26:34.206
and with him...

26:34.207 --> 26:36.179
(Fyren)
The Council is here to see you,
mistress.

26:36.180 --> 26:37.414
Show them in.

26:40.085 --> 26:41.319
Zedd,

26:41.320 --> 26:43.854
this really isn't
your concern.

26:46.290 --> 26:47.657
Mother Confessor.

26:47.658 --> 26:51.160
The Council of the Midlands
has returned to be seated.

26:51.161 --> 26:52.861
(Kahlan)
That won't be necessary.

26:54.897 --> 26:56.831
Under the Council's watch,

26:56.832 --> 27:00.334
Prince Fyren was able
to usurp my authority

27:00.335 --> 27:04.837
and unleash a reign of terror
all over the Midlands.

27:04.838 --> 27:07.640
The Council has proven itself

27:07.641 --> 27:10.275
utterly ineffective,

27:10.276 --> 27:11.809
and is hereby disbanded.

27:11.810 --> 27:16.547
Justice in the Midlands
requires only one voice:

27:16.548 --> 27:17.815
mine.

27:17.816 --> 27:20.116
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

27:27.423 --> 27:28.923
I don't know
what happened to you

27:28.924 --> 27:30.325
when we used that amulet
to get here,

27:30.326 --> 27:32.527
but something
has happened to you, Kahlan.

27:32.528 --> 27:34.161
You are not yourself.

27:34.162 --> 27:37.864
Zedd, you came with me
to ensure that I arrived safely.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.065
I'm safe.

27:39.066 --> 27:41.800
Now, you're free to go back
to Cara and Richard

27:41.801 --> 27:43.268
and help them find
the Stone of Tears.

27:43.269 --> 27:45.670
But if you choose to stay
in Aydindril,

27:45.671 --> 27:48.606
you will not question
my authority again.

27:51.109 --> 27:53.644
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

27:59.350 --> 28:01.718
I've held my tongue
for days now.

28:01.719 --> 28:04.087
I can no longer
remain silent.

28:04.088 --> 28:08.057
I know Kahlan Amnell very well,
and this is not Kahlan.

28:08.058 --> 28:11.260
You think the Mother Confessor
is an imposter?

28:11.261 --> 28:12.894
She can't be.

28:12.895 --> 28:14.529
I traveled here
with her myself.

28:14.530 --> 28:18.767
Something happened to her
when the amulet was broken.

28:18.768 --> 28:20.969
I've been searching the scrolls
at the Wizard's Keep

28:20.970 --> 28:22.571
for answers,
but I've found nothing.

28:22.572 --> 28:24.773
What do you suggest we do?

28:26.643 --> 28:28.410
We can't let her
remain in power.

28:28.411 --> 28:31.646
A Wizard's web will keep
her contained, but unharmed.

28:31.647 --> 28:35.550
Putting the Mother Confessor
in a Wizard's web is treason.

28:35.551 --> 28:38.921
I wish there was another way.

28:38.922 --> 28:41.824
So do I.

28:41.825 --> 28:43.792
( grunting )

28:43.793 --> 28:46.261
I may only be a Wizard
of the Second Order,

28:46.262 --> 28:47.595
but I believe it was you

28:47.596 --> 28:49.763
who taught me the element
of surprise is everything.

28:49.764 --> 28:50.798
Guards!

28:50.799 --> 28:53.366
( shouting in ancient tongue )

28:59.276 --> 29:01.344
Alferon, why?

29:01.345 --> 29:03.513
You were plotting
against my mistress.

29:04.982 --> 29:07.649
She confessed me
just yesterday.

29:07.650 --> 29:09.584
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

29:13.288 --> 29:15.355
( horse whinnying )

29:17.759 --> 29:19.526
This man
has committed treason.

29:19.527 --> 29:21.327
As Mother Confessor,

29:21.328 --> 29:24.829
I am sworn to uphold the highest
standards of justice.

29:24.830 --> 29:28.665
The crime of treason
threatens justice itself.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.267
And when justice
is threatened,

29:30.268 --> 29:32.771
it is all of society
that suffers.

29:32.772 --> 29:35.540
Though I have known this man
for a long time,

29:35.541 --> 29:37.909
I do not make exceptions.

29:37.910 --> 29:41.279
Everyone is to be treated
fairly.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.347
No one,

29:43.348 --> 29:45.249
not even a Wizard
of the First Order...

29:45.250 --> 29:46.717
Who is that?

29:46.718 --> 29:48.351
...is above the law.
It's you.

29:48.352 --> 29:52.155
For conspiring to overthrow
the Mother Confessor,

29:52.156 --> 29:53.389
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander,

29:53.390 --> 29:57.225
I sentence you to death
by hanging at first light.

30:05.143 --> 30:06.310
We have to do something.

30:06.311 --> 30:08.645
Wait.

30:08.646 --> 30:10.113
Don't let her see you.

30:10.114 --> 30:12.615
But that imposter
just sentenced Zedd to death.

30:12.616 --> 30:14.283
She has guards everywhere.

30:14.284 --> 30:15.984
If she's powerful enough
to capture Zedd,

30:15.985 --> 30:17.619
there's no telling
what she's capable of.

30:17.620 --> 30:20.254
I have to tell them
that she's not me.

30:20.255 --> 30:22.723
I'm not so sure about that.
What do you mean?

30:22.724 --> 30:25.725
I don't think the amulet was the
only thing that split in two.

30:25.726 --> 30:28.595
Don't ask me to explain it.
We need to get to Zedd.

30:28.596 --> 30:30.330
Not like that.

30:30.331 --> 30:33.165
Then how do you propose
we get to him?

30:33.166 --> 30:35.100
(Kahlan)
<i>Seven years' hard labor.</i>

30:35.101 --> 30:37.203
Bring the next supplicant.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.646
Mother Confessor.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.348
Richard.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.383
I'm surprised to see you
in Aydindril.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.851
Why are you here?

30:53.852 --> 30:57.755
I was concerned about you
and my grandfather.

30:57.756 --> 31:00.591
I'm sorry, Richard.

31:00.592 --> 31:01.992
But Zedd has become a threat.

31:01.993 --> 31:03.693
He tried to depose me.

31:03.694 --> 31:06.797
I had no choice but to find him
guilty of treason.

31:06.798 --> 31:08.832
That doesn't sound like Zedd.

31:08.833 --> 31:10.500
How can you be sure?

31:10.501 --> 31:12.569
I'm always sure.

31:12.570 --> 31:13.803
It's part of my gift.

31:13.804 --> 31:16.339
He dies in the morning.

31:16.340 --> 31:17.841
Now, you should get back
to your quest.

31:17.842 --> 31:20.076
We're all depending on you.

31:20.077 --> 31:22.678
Yes, Mother Confessor.

31:22.679 --> 31:25.681
But before my grandfather dies,

31:25.682 --> 31:27.549
I'd like to see him.

31:27.550 --> 31:29.217
I believe it's my right.

31:31.888 --> 31:35.524
Guards, please escort the Seeker
to the dungeon.

31:39.295 --> 31:41.663
Of course.
It all makes sense now.

31:41.664 --> 31:43.998
If only I had
realized it sooner.

31:43.999 --> 31:45.166
Realized what?

31:45.167 --> 31:47.701
The amulet
is very powerful.

31:47.702 --> 31:50.204
It's magically linked to the
heart of the Mother Confessor.

31:50.205 --> 31:52.005
It can find her anywhere
in the world.

31:52.006 --> 31:55.142
When we used it to come here,

31:55.143 --> 31:57.577
in her heart,
Kahlan was torn.

31:57.578 --> 31:59.212
Part of her wanted
to stay with you,

31:59.213 --> 32:01.080
and that part stayed.

32:01.081 --> 32:04.251
So which one is really Kahlan?

32:04.252 --> 32:05.586
Neither.

32:05.587 --> 32:07.021
I don't understand.

32:07.022 --> 32:11.793
We're all a delicate combination
of duty and desire.

32:11.794 --> 32:13.495
The heart and the head.

32:13.496 --> 32:16.129
Constantly keeping each other
in balance.

32:16.130 --> 32:18.397
It takes both to make us whole.

32:18.398 --> 32:20.565
How did this happen?

32:20.566 --> 32:23.768
Kahlan's innermost desire
was to stay,

32:23.769 --> 32:25.771
but her duty was to go.

32:25.772 --> 32:27.272
So when the amulet broke,

32:27.273 --> 32:29.307
the woman in love
stayed with you,

32:29.308 --> 32:33.510
and the Confessor sworn
to serve the Midlands came here.

32:33.511 --> 32:37.714
There has to be a way to put
both halves back together.

32:37.715 --> 32:41.451
With both pieces of the amulet,
I think I could.

32:41.452 --> 32:45.221
Of course, that's assuming
I have the use of my hands.

32:45.222 --> 32:46.623
I'm going to get you
out of here.

32:46.624 --> 32:48.625
How?

32:48.626 --> 32:52.561
You said the Mother Confessor
is guided by reason alone?

32:52.562 --> 32:55.765
(Richard)
<i>I'd like to speak</i>
<i>on Zedd's behalf</i>

32:55.766 --> 32:57.367
before his sentence
is carried out.

32:57.368 --> 32:59.439
It's your right to speak.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.307
In sentencing Zedd for treason,

33:01.308 --> 33:03.008
you failed to take
into consideration

33:03.009 --> 33:04.977
his exceptional
life and deeds.

33:04.978 --> 33:07.779
Should I list them?

33:07.780 --> 33:10.115
I'm well aware
of Zedd's accomplishments.

33:10.116 --> 33:12.050
But it doesn't change the fact

33:12.051 --> 33:14.987
that he conspired
to overthrow me.

33:14.988 --> 33:16.422
He broke the law.

33:16.423 --> 33:19.391
As the Mother Confessor,
the law is what you say it is.

33:19.392 --> 33:22.228
And I say the Code of Aydindril
is the law.

33:22.229 --> 33:24.831
I've read the Code of Aydindril.

33:24.832 --> 33:27.933
It was written
by the first Mother Confessor.

33:27.934 --> 33:31.503
She said there is no justice
be it not tempered by mercy.

33:31.504 --> 33:34.038
Magda Searus,
the first Mother Confessor,

33:34.039 --> 33:36.574
she was not without her enemies.

33:36.575 --> 33:38.009
She killed when
it was necessary.

33:38.010 --> 33:39.743
(Richard)
She did kill.

33:39.744 --> 33:43.313
In fact, she insisted that all
male Confessor babies be killed

33:43.314 --> 33:45.248
because they lacked
the compassion necessary

33:45.249 --> 33:46.783
to control their powers.

33:46.784 --> 33:48.351
Is my sex in question,
Richard?

33:48.352 --> 33:50.553
No.

33:50.554 --> 33:53.089
But your compassion is.

33:53.090 --> 33:54.924
You have none.

33:54.925 --> 33:58.260
Because you are, in fact,
not the Mother Confessor.

34:00.463 --> 34:02.665
You know who I am, Richard.

34:02.666 --> 34:03.899
(Richard)
I know your kindness,

34:03.900 --> 34:05.800
your wisdom,

34:05.801 --> 34:08.536
and yes, your compassion.

34:08.536 --> 34:10.271
But I don't see these things
in you.

34:12.474 --> 34:16.476
Because they're in her.

34:16.478 --> 34:19.313
( all gasping )

34:19.313 --> 34:21.581
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

34:28.355 --> 34:30.389
This is a trick.

34:30.389 --> 34:31.958
(Richard)
This is no trick.

34:31.958 --> 34:36.196
She's been with me
since the moment you left.

34:36.197 --> 34:39.000
When you used the amulet,
you were split in two.

34:39.001 --> 34:41.902
You may have your powers
and your sharp mind,

34:41.904 --> 34:44.139
but the rest of you is in her.

34:44.139 --> 34:47.376
Your heart.
Your compassion.

34:47.377 --> 34:49.643
Your mercy.

34:51.245 --> 34:53.775
Mother Confessor
needs all of it.

34:55.143 --> 34:57.377
Zedd can fix this.

34:57.378 --> 34:58.909
He can put you back together.

34:58.910 --> 35:01.242
He can make you
a whole person again.

35:01.243 --> 35:02.710
But until he does,

35:02.711 --> 35:05.545
you don't have the right
to decide his fate,

35:05.546 --> 35:06.913
or anyone else's.

35:08.149 --> 35:10.249
Let's assume you're correct,

35:10.250 --> 35:13.252
and I no longer have the part
of me that cares for you

35:13.253 --> 35:14.820
or for Zedd.

35:14.821 --> 35:18.656
That compassion,
as you call it,

35:18.657 --> 35:20.758
kept me from my duties here.

35:22.861 --> 35:25.695
Without it,
I'm a better leader.

35:25.696 --> 35:27.196
A better judge.

35:27.197 --> 35:28.998
A better Confessor.

35:30.600 --> 35:34.602
Whatever she is, I don't need
her getting in the way of that.

35:34.603 --> 35:37.171
If you refuse to allow Zedd
to put you back together,

35:37.172 --> 35:40.274
you will leave this woman
without her reason, her power.

35:40.275 --> 35:42.242
Is that just?

35:44.245 --> 35:45.812
She has no powers?

35:48.448 --> 35:50.916
Then you and Richard
can be together.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.653
Do you feel incomplete?

36:00.791 --> 36:02.491
You can't lie
to a Confessor.

36:02.492 --> 36:04.092
I think you know that.

36:04.093 --> 36:05.793
No.

36:05.794 --> 36:08.362
I don't feel incomplete.

36:08.363 --> 36:13.032
If you're part of me,
then I don't want you back.

36:13.033 --> 36:14.768
Not if it means
I'd put duty above love.

36:14.769 --> 36:16.637
Not if it means I can never
be Richard's wife.

36:18.073 --> 36:21.641
I'm never going
to be your husband.

36:21.642 --> 36:23.042
No, you'll change your mind.

36:23.043 --> 36:25.277
I can be everything
that you want.

36:25.278 --> 36:26.912
I won't ask you
to give up your quest.

36:26.913 --> 36:29.347
I'll-- I'll love Cara
like a sister, and--

36:29.348 --> 36:31.215
And you can have her too,
if that's what you want.

36:31.216 --> 36:33.417
And you'll love me,
just like you did before.

36:33.418 --> 36:34.984
Would you look at her?

36:34.985 --> 36:37.719
She's not in her right mind.

36:39.421 --> 36:41.388
And neither are you.

36:41.389 --> 36:43.123
Richard.

36:43.124 --> 36:47.092
I understand that you missed
some idealized version

36:47.093 --> 36:49.794
of the Kahlan you loved.

36:49.795 --> 36:52.830
But you do not have the right to
murder two distinct individuals

36:52.831 --> 36:55.098
simply to get the one
that you want.

36:55.099 --> 36:56.632
I've made my decision.

36:56.633 --> 36:58.167
Go back to your quest.
Take her with you.

36:58.168 --> 37:00.602
I'm not going anywhere
until you let Zedd go.

37:00.603 --> 37:05.107
Then you will be arrested for
defying the Mother Confessor.

37:05.108 --> 37:06.241
Seize them.

37:10.312 --> 37:13.747
( <i>action theme playing</i> )

37:13.748 --> 37:14.982
( indistinct shouting )

37:26.425 --> 37:27.759
( shouting )

37:38.871 --> 37:40.405
Richard!

37:43.141 --> 37:45.174
Stop them.
They'll kill him.

37:45.175 --> 37:46.543
Richard!

37:48.179 --> 37:49.346
( gasps )

37:49.347 --> 37:52.348
It seems my emotions
are still getting in my way.

37:52.349 --> 37:53.715
Kahlan, no!

38:05.327 --> 38:06.861
Command me, mistress.

38:12.862 --> 38:14.062
Help me fight him.

38:16.380 --> 38:17.914
Yes, mistress.

38:19.951 --> 38:23.354
That was foolish, Cara. One
touch from me could kill you.

38:23.355 --> 38:25.322
( Agiel whining )
Ah!

38:25.323 --> 38:27.557
Mistress!

38:27.558 --> 38:30.593
I told you I'd die
to protect Richard.

38:30.594 --> 38:31.961
Fortunately, I won't have to.

38:34.230 --> 38:38.901
Drop your weapons or I kill her.

38:38.902 --> 38:40.402
Mistress, please,
they'll kill you.

38:40.403 --> 38:42.939
Richard won't let her
kill me.

38:42.940 --> 38:46.778
I never said both of you had
to be alive for Zedd to fix you.

38:46.779 --> 38:48.279
You're bluffing.

38:48.280 --> 38:49.514
(Richard)
Am I?

38:49.515 --> 38:51.616
How can you be sure of that?

38:51.617 --> 38:54.686
(Kahlan)
Don't kill her! Mistress,
please, do as they say.

38:54.687 --> 38:56.520
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

39:06.097 --> 39:08.699
Drop your weapons.

39:20.177 --> 39:21.310
(Richard)
Release Zedd.

39:21.311 --> 39:23.479
Right now.

39:26.016 --> 39:27.483
I will.

39:27.484 --> 39:29.584
But before you do anything
to harm me,

39:29.585 --> 39:33.789
you should know
I may be with child.

39:35.424 --> 39:38.226
Mistress, I could also
be with child.

39:40.530 --> 39:42.030
Your child.

39:56.847 --> 39:59.014
Neither of you
is with child.

39:59.015 --> 40:02.251
But Fyren and I were intimate
many times.

40:02.252 --> 40:05.354
Both of you are nothing more
than magical fragments.

40:05.355 --> 40:06.989
Conception under such
circumstances

40:06.990 --> 40:08.924
would be impossible.

40:08.925 --> 40:10.592
You know I'm telling you
the truth.

40:12.796 --> 40:15.297
Richard,
please don't kill her.

40:15.298 --> 40:16.331
If you still love me--

40:16.332 --> 40:17.933
If you care about
the Midlands--

40:20.703 --> 40:22.370
Do it.

40:25.175 --> 40:27.409
( chanting in ancient tongue )

40:38.954 --> 40:41.089
Kahlan.

40:42.525 --> 40:43.592
Are we in Aydindril?

40:45.061 --> 40:47.195
Yes. Yes, we're in Aydindril.

40:47.196 --> 40:48.630
( sighs )

40:50.199 --> 40:51.299
Are you all right?

40:51.300 --> 40:52.700
I'm fine.

40:52.701 --> 40:56.004
I'm so sorry, old friend.

40:56.005 --> 40:58.539
There's no need.

40:58.540 --> 41:00.374
(Richard)
If he's released
from confession,

41:00.375 --> 41:02.810
then we really did kill
two women.

41:02.811 --> 41:06.680
Two women who should never have
existed in the first place.

41:06.681 --> 41:09.250
What are you two
talking about?

41:09.251 --> 41:10.684
You really don't remember?

41:10.685 --> 41:12.052
Remember what?

41:18.261 --> 41:20.128
Richard, there are some things
that you told me

41:20.129 --> 41:22.830
that I'm glad
I don't remember.

41:22.831 --> 41:26.267
And some that I wish
I did.

41:26.268 --> 41:29.470
I have enough memories
for the both of us.

41:29.471 --> 41:31.739
When Zedd
put me back together,

41:31.740 --> 41:33.207
you gave up something too.

41:33.208 --> 41:34.308
Kahlan.

41:37.112 --> 41:40.447
If I'd known what happened
to you, I never would've--

41:40.448 --> 41:42.349
I know.

41:42.350 --> 41:44.752
But we did.

41:44.753 --> 41:46.086
And you said it was--

41:46.087 --> 41:47.521
Yes, it was.

41:47.522 --> 41:48.989
( both chuckle )

41:48.990 --> 41:52.492
But I'd rather have you,
all of you, just the way we are,

41:52.493 --> 41:55.295
than everything else
with someone who's not you.

41:57.998 --> 41:59.632
Richard,
if you hadn't stopped me,

41:59.633 --> 42:01.267
I would have executed Zedd.

42:01.268 --> 42:03.435
That wasn't you.

42:05.004 --> 42:07.939
Well, at least I get the chance
to make things right here.

42:07.940 --> 42:10.909
You're going to stay?

42:10.910 --> 42:13.745
No.

42:13.746 --> 42:15.913
I'm going to reinstate the
Council and send for my sister

42:15.914 --> 42:19.317
so Aydindril doesn't have to be
without a Confessor.

42:19.318 --> 42:22.652
And if I'm needed,
Alferon has the amulet.

42:22.653 --> 42:25.989
You know I'd understand
if you did want to stay.

42:29.294 --> 42:31.795
I'll always be torn.

42:31.796 --> 42:35.265
But I can only be in one place
at a time.

42:35.266 --> 42:38.135
Right now,
that place is with you.
