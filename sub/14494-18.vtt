01:06.422 --> 01:11.548

the 21st century has begun.

02:39.236 --> 02:40.036
Report!

02:40.036 --> 02:43.743
Sir, the Helicarrier is taking fire
from multiple unknown contacts.

02:43.743 --> 02:45.423
Shielding is ineffective.

02:45.423 --> 02:47.593
I just got this boat back in the air,

02:47.593 --> 02:49.594
I'm not about to let her go down again.

02:49.594 --> 02:52.424
Director Fury, this isn't
just an attack on SHIELD.

02:52.424 --> 02:54.178
The United Nations is under attack.

02:54.178 --> 02:56.456
We're getting distress
calls from all over.

02:56.456 --> 02:58.609
Sir, what are your orders?

03:00.097 --> 03:02.636
So one get me the Avengers.

03:26.376 --> 03:28.582
Avengers assemble!

03:57.528 --> 04:00.740
So much destruction.
Why would someone do this?

04:00.740 --> 04:03.070
Why? I'm still working on "What?"

04:04.978 --> 04:07.341
What are these things? Aliens?

04:08.292 --> 04:11.629
Unlikely, given the
Egyptian styling to them.

04:12.762 --> 04:14.921
More likely this is Kang.

04:16.991 --> 04:19.659
Launch the second wave of scarabs.

04:26.514 --> 04:30.036
Truly, this is a battle the likes
of which Midgard has never seen.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.575
How fare thee, Wasp?

04:39.129 --> 04:41.726
Ugh, I need bigger stingers.

04:41.726 --> 04:43.123
This is crazy.

04:45.521 --> 04:47.221
Do we have a plan?

04:48.086 --> 04:49.828
Where is Iron Man?

04:49.828 --> 04:50.908
Return fire!

04:50.908 --> 04:53.250
Sir, all weapon's systems are offline.

04:53.250 --> 04:56.007
We can't... Sir, incoming!

05:02.371 --> 05:03.892
What took you so long?

05:03.892 --> 05:05.705
Hey, traffic's worse than normal.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.707
The Helicarrier is a
sitting duck out here, Fury,

05:07.707 --> 05:09.194
you need to get clear of the city.

05:09.194 --> 05:11.002
The Avengers can handle this.

05:11.002 --> 05:13.501
Yeah, you want to tell me
how you intend to do that?

05:13.501 --> 05:16.322
Sure, once I figure it out myself.

05:19.430 --> 05:22.919
The Hulk boasted that he would
smash more machines than I.

05:22.919 --> 05:24.810
He is sorely mistaken.

05:24.810 --> 05:27.974
You could at least act like you're
a little worried about this, Thor.

05:27.974 --> 05:33.253
Sadly, I have faced such odds
before in the defense of Asgard.

05:33.253 --> 05:34.084
Jarvis,

05:34.084 --> 05:36.543
isolate one of these things and analyze.

05:39.271 --> 05:41.436
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

05:41.812 --> 05:43.164
I kid thee not.

05:43.164 --> 05:47.133
No, these robots, the ships,
I know this tech. This is all...

05:47.133 --> 05:50.815
<i>Did you really think
that you had defeated me?</i>

05:50.815 --> 05:51.662
Kang.

05:51.662 --> 05:55.774
<i>I told you Avengers that
I would save this world.</i>

05:55.774 --> 05:59.086
<i>Under my rule, Earth will be strong.</i>

05:59.086 --> 06:02.103
<i>It will survive the coming onslaught.</i>

06:02.103 --> 06:06.725
<i>I've been learning the strengths and
weaknesses of your era's defenses.</i>

06:06.725 --> 06:11.659
<i>And now the true conquest begins.</i>

06:18.428 --> 06:19.577
Uh-oh.

06:25.778 --> 06:28.042
They're regenerating.
They're self-repairing,

06:28.042 --> 06:31.715
this was all an act... we
never even made a dent.

06:39.231 --> 06:41.315
Hawkeye, Panther fire at will.

06:41.315 --> 06:43.329
Hulk, free Giant Man.

06:43.927 --> 06:45.008
Move!

07:08.543 --> 07:10.381
Oh, come on.

07:32.881 --> 07:34.515
We've got a big problem here, old man.

07:34.515 --> 07:35.620
They're corralling us.

07:35.620 --> 07:38.460
I know. We need to set a
rally point and regroup.

07:38.460 --> 07:40.346
How many explosive
arrows do you have left?

07:40.346 --> 07:43.003
None. I could throw rocks if you want.

07:52.856 --> 07:54.898
I found bigger stingers.

07:54.898 --> 07:56.610
You boys might want to duck.

08:20.217 --> 08:21.462
Is everyone okay?

08:21.462 --> 08:23.071
We don't have time not to be.

08:23.071 --> 08:25.619
These things are moving through
the city, block by block.

08:25.619 --> 08:29.511
- We need to divert them.
- It's Kang. The ships, robots, everything.

08:29.511 --> 08:30.717
It's all Kang.

08:30.717 --> 08:32.219
He's invading the city.

08:32.219 --> 08:34.272
<i>No exactly Iron Man.</i>

08:34.830 --> 08:37.995
Tactical targets are being hit
all along the Eastern seaboard.

08:37.995 --> 08:41.144
Well, why New York then?
They're no tactical targets in the city.

08:41.144 --> 08:43.458
The Avengers are a tactical target.

08:43.458 --> 08:44.555
There's more.

08:44.555 --> 08:46.293
This isn't just happening here.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.360
It's happening all over the world.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.894
Kang isn't just invading New York,

08:52.652 --> 08:55.745
he's taking over the entire planet.

09:29.491 --> 09:33.340
<i>Every major city in the world
is under attack by Kang's forces.</i>

09:33.340 --> 09:34.662
<i>Several have already fallen.</i>

09:34.662 --> 09:36.482
<i>Even more are surrendering.</i>

09:36.482 --> 09:39.387
<i>If we're going to turn this around,
we don't have much time.</i>

09:39.942 --> 09:42.399
This is... this is madness.

09:42.399 --> 09:43.959
How are we supposed to fight this?

09:43.959 --> 09:48.314
Nick, have you had any luck with
those flying discs I saw up in the sky?

09:48.314 --> 09:50.561
<i>Conventional weapons
aren't making a dent.</i>

09:50.561 --> 09:53.442
<i>We were hoping Stark
might have some ideas.</i>

09:53.442 --> 09:55.120
There was a back door in Kang's tech

09:55.120 --> 09:57.540
that I was able to exploit
when we first met him,

09:57.540 --> 09:58.862
but he's closed it off.

09:58.862 --> 10:01.035
I'm still analyzing the data I got.

10:03.042 --> 10:06.446
Your people need their king.
You should go.

10:06.446 --> 10:10.239
What? That's not your
call, Cap, we need all the...

10:11.802 --> 10:15.162
Right. T'Challa, take
one of the Quinjets.

10:15.162 --> 10:17.326
We'll be there to
help as soon as we can.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.550
Thank you, my friends.

10:21.616 --> 10:23.190
<i>You have to do something.</i>

10:23.190 --> 10:24.794
<i>We're hopelessly outnumbered here.</i>

10:24.794 --> 10:27.433
<i>Are forces are barely holding out.</i>

10:27.433 --> 10:29.103
We have to find Kang.

10:29.103 --> 10:30.304
Take the fight to him.

10:30.304 --> 10:31.144
He's right.

10:31.144 --> 10:33.134
We stop Kang, we end this invasion.

10:33.134 --> 10:34.917
Do we have any idea where he is?

10:34.917 --> 10:37.724
No. My tech couldn't
trace his communication.

10:37.724 --> 10:40.666
He could be on any one of those ships,
anywhere on the planet.

10:40.666 --> 10:42.697
The Avengers have to get back out there.

10:42.697 --> 10:44.368
People need our help.

10:44.368 --> 10:46.646
We'll buy you as much time as we can.

10:47.468 --> 10:51.058
Find Kang. You're the only
one who can do it, Tony.

10:51.737 --> 10:54.225
I hate him. You know, when he's right.

10:54.225 --> 10:56.277
That's how the rest
of us feel about you.

10:56.979 --> 10:58.107
Good luck, Tony.

11:13.869 --> 11:15.799
There's more heading for the bridge.

11:33.492 --> 11:37.053
- You ready, jade jaws?
- I'm always ready.

12:00.682 --> 12:03.972
Goldilocks thought he'd smash
more robots than me.

12:03.972 --> 12:05.864
Stupid hammer man.

12:10.894 --> 12:12.451
Hey, you want to focus here, green?

12:12.451 --> 12:14.902
We have to hold out until
the bridge evacuates.

12:14.902 --> 12:18.253
And I've taken down more of these things
than both you and Thor combined.

12:20.613 --> 12:23.339
All right, I'll take...
I'll take them all.

12:23.339 --> 12:24.943
You just rest, big guy.

12:32.074 --> 12:34.823
Hm, maybe I will rest now.

12:34.823 --> 12:36.133
Good luck.

12:41.206 --> 12:43.184
Great, now I have to save the Hulk.

12:43.184 --> 12:44.759
That's just... Whoa!

13:32.771 --> 13:33.881
So what now?

13:33.881 --> 13:36.961
Well, I think there's
only 700 million left.

13:39.951 --> 13:41.493
<i>Tony, it's Hank. Any luck?</i>

13:41.493 --> 13:44.018
If I'd found him, Hank,
I'd have given you a ring.

13:44.018 --> 13:46.405
I'm connected to every
satellite in the world right now,

13:46.405 --> 13:48.189
I can't detect Kang anywhere!

13:48.189 --> 13:50.000
<i>All of this technology is useless!</i>

13:50.000 --> 13:53.854
- Uh, he's still working on it.
- Oh, well, that's wonderful.

13:53.854 --> 13:57.158
Maybe Kang will let us call
a time out until we find him.

13:57.158 --> 13:58.186
Cap?

13:59.873 --> 14:01.322
This is war...

14:01.322 --> 14:03.325
and we need an army.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.483
I know where you can find an army.

14:26.785 --> 14:28.717
What do you call these things?

14:29.235 --> 14:30.715
Ultron.

14:32.593 --> 14:34.543
I'll just say
it again for the record.

14:34.543 --> 14:36.533
I'm not comfortable with this.

14:36.533 --> 14:39.498
The Ultrons have built-in weapons
systems that Iron Man designed,

14:39.498 --> 14:42.854
but I've disabled everything
except a simple stun blast.

14:42.854 --> 14:45.195
People's lives are at stake, Doctor Pym.

14:45.195 --> 14:47.513
If you have a better idea,
I'm open to it.

14:47.513 --> 14:51.564
But as it stands, these robots of yours
are our only chance to even the odds.

14:51.564 --> 14:53.620
The world is counting on us.

15:00.945 --> 15:02.496
What are you doing?

15:02.496 --> 15:06.098
I'm teaching Ultron
the concept of violence.

15:14.394 --> 15:17.035
<i>Programming accepted.</i>

15:18.850 --> 15:19.661
<i>Tony, it's...</i>

15:19.661 --> 15:21.820
<i>- Not there yet, Hank.
- Tony, listen.</i>

15:21.820 --> 15:24.132
<i>Cap's got a plan for
dealing with Kang's forces,</i>

15:24.132 --> 15:27.431
<i>but it's all moot if we can't find Kang
and take down the Armada ship.</i>

15:27.431 --> 15:29.455
I don't know where he is, okay?

15:29.817 --> 15:31.861
I just can't... Argh.

15:31.861 --> 15:33.475
<i>Keep at it, soldier.</i>

16:35.082 --> 16:36.197
<i>You are safe now.</i>

16:36.197 --> 16:38.358
<i>Everything is going to be all right.</i>

16:38.358 --> 16:40.343
<i>Do you need medical attention?</i>

16:52.325 --> 16:54.063
Take them down, Avengers.

16:58.961 --> 17:01.431
<i>Wasp,
Ant-Man, you know the plan.</i>

17:01.431 --> 17:03.086
We're good to go, Cap.

17:03.553 --> 17:05.944
You seem way too excited about all this.

17:06.284 --> 17:09.906
- I'm a extremely positive person.
- Well, that makes one of us.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.777
See? Everything according to plan.

17:27.777 --> 17:32.197
You know those Quinjets cost Tony
about $20 million apiece, right?

17:33.884 --> 17:36.732
Well, it wasn't my plan.

17:55.260 --> 17:56.311
Hi.

18:00.864 --> 18:03.827
This is of similar design to
portions of Kang's time chair.

18:03.827 --> 18:05.890
Iron Man and I theorized
that Kang's equipment

18:05.890 --> 18:08.568
must have some kind of
temporal stasis device,

18:08.568 --> 18:11.606
something that allows
it to remain in this era,

18:11.606 --> 18:12.867
like an anchor.

18:12.867 --> 18:14.117
If we destroy that anchor,

18:14.117 --> 18:16.857
the ship theoretically
would return to its own time.

18:16.857 --> 18:18.878
Ugh, I'm gonna blast it now.

18:29.248 --> 18:29.968
Oh!

18:35.340 --> 18:40.213
Lord Kang, one of the Armada ships
has lost its connection to the timeline.

18:40.530 --> 18:42.581
It's... it's gone.

19:07.990 --> 19:09.337
<i>Cap, this is Ant-Man.</i>

19:09.337 --> 19:12.863
<i>Tell the others it worked.
They're clear to proceed.</i>

19:12.863 --> 19:14.706
<i>You heard the man, Avengers.</i>

19:28.918 --> 19:31.558
Armada ship 795 to Damocles.

19:31.558 --> 19:34.765
I am under attack!
I repeat, I am under a...

19:55.091 --> 19:57.891
Time to smash.

20:02.816 --> 20:06.701
And that's how you free New York from
an invasion of time traveling robots.

20:06.701 --> 20:08.543
This was just a battle.

20:08.865 --> 20:11.422
There are hundreds of ships,
all over the world.

20:11.422 --> 20:12.912
Thousands of robots.

20:12.912 --> 20:16.842
The war will never
end until we find Kang.

20:17.352 --> 20:18.147
Nothing.

20:18.147 --> 20:20.817
All my technology, and I got nothing.

20:21.331 --> 20:24.146
Where on Earth are you?

20:25.334 --> 20:26.536
Earth?

20:26.730 --> 20:28.689
What if he's not on Earth?

20:28.689 --> 20:32.205
Jarvis, get me all scans of
space in the last 24 hours,

20:32.205 --> 20:34.032
full spectrum analysis.

20:34.032 --> 20:37.047
Focus on geo-synchronous
orbit over North America.

21:03.542 --> 21:05.715
This is Iron Man to the Avengers.
